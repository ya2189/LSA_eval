respectfully
and
affectionately
inscribed

the
author
part
first
chapter
i
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
this
evening
alfred
said
royal
to
his
companion
as
they
issued
from
his
in
new
orleans
perhaps
i
ought
to
apologize
for
not
calling
you
king
considering
the
shortness
of
our
acquaintance
but
your
father
and
i
were
like
brothers
in
our
youth
and
you
resemble
him
so
much
i
can
hardly
realize
that
you
are
not
he
himself
and
i
still
a
young
man
it
used
to
be
a
joke
with
us
that
we
must
be
cousins
since
he
was
a
king
and
i
was
of
the
royal
family
so
excuse
me
if
i
say
to
you
as
i
used
to
say
to
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
cousin
alfred
i
thank
you
for
the
friendly
familiarity
rejoined
the
young
man
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
i
remind
you
so
strongly
of
my
good
father
my
most
earnest
wish
is
to
resemble
him
in
character
as
much
as
i
am
said
to
resemble
him
in
person
i
have
formed
no
plans
for
the
evening
i
was
just
about
to
ask
you
what
there
was
best
worth
seeing
or
hearing
in
the
crescent
city
if
i
should
tell
you
i
thought
there
was
nothing
better
worth
seeing
than
my
daughters
you
would
perhaps
excuse
a
father
partiality
rejoined
royal
your
daughters
exclaimed
his
companion
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
never
heard
that
you
were
married
a
shadow
of
embarrassment
passed
over
the
merchant
face
as
he
replied
their
mother
was
a
spanish
lady
a
stranger
here
and
she
formed
no
acquaintance
she
was
a
woman
of
a
great
heart
and
of
rare
beauty
nothing
can
ever
make
up
her
loss
to
me
but
all
the
joy
that
remains
in
life
is
centred
in
the
daughters
she
has
left
me
i
should
like
to
introduce
them
to
you
and
that
is
a
compliment
i
never
before
paid
to
any
young
man
my
home
is
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
when
we
have
dined
at
the
hotel
according
to
my
daily
habit
i
will
send
off
a
few
letters
and
then
if
you
like
to
go
there
with
me
i
will
call
a
carriage
thank
you
replied
the
young
man
unless
it
is
your
own
custom
to
ride
i
should
prefer
to
walk
i
like
the
exercise
and
it
will
give
a
better
opportunity
to
observe
the
city
which
is
so
different
from
our
northern
towns
that
it
has
for
me
the
attractions
of
a
foreign
land
in
compliance
with
this
wish
royal
took
him
through
the
principal
streets
pointing
out
the
public
buildings
and
now
and
then
stopping
to
smile
at
some
placard
or
sign
which
presented
an
odd
jumble
of
french
and
english
when
they
came
to
the
suburbs
of
the
city
the
aspect
of
things
became
charmingly
rural
houses
were
scattered
here
and
there
among
trees
and
gardens
royal
pointed
out
one
of
them
nestled
in
flowers
and
half
encircled
by
an
and
said
that
is
my
home
when
i
first
came
here
the
place
where
it
stands
was
a
field
of
but
the
city
is
fast
stretching
itself
into
the
suburbs
they
approached
the
dwelling
and
in
answer
to
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
a
comely
young
negress
with
a
turban
of
bright
colors
on
her
head
and
golden
hoops
in
her
ears
before
the
gentlemen
had
disposed
of
their
hats
and
canes
a
light
little
figure
bounded
from
one
of
the
rooms
clapping
her
hands
and
exclaiming
ah
papasito
then
seeing
a
stranger
with
him
she
suddenly
stood
still
with
a
pretty
look
of
blushing
surprise
never
mind
mignonne
said
her
father
fondly
patting
her
head
this
is
alfred
royal
king
from
boston
my
namesake
and
the
son
of
a
dear
old
friend
of
mine
i
have
invited
him
to
see
you
dance
king
this
is
my
floracita
the
fairy
dotted
a
courtesy
quickly
and
gracefully
as
a
butterfly
touching
a
flower
and
then
darted
back
into
the
room
she
had
left
there
they
were
met
by
a
taller
young
lady
who
was
introduced
as
my
daughter
rosabella
her
beauty
was
superlative
and
peculiar
her
complexion
was
like
a
glowing
reflection
upon
ivory
from
gold
in
the
sunshine
her
large
brown
eyes
were
deeply
fringed
and
lambent
with
interior
light
lustrous
dark
brown
hair
shaded
her
forehead
in
little
waves
slight
as
the
rippling
of
water
touched
by
an
insect
wing
it
was
arranged
at
the
back
of
her
head
in
circling
braids
over
which
fell
clusters
of
ringlets
with
nestling
among
them
her
full
red
lips
were
beautifully
shaped
and
wore
a
mingled
expression
of
dignity
and
sweetness
the
line
from
ear
to
chin
was
that
perfect
oval
which
artists
love
and
the
carriage
of
her
head
was
like
one
born
to
a
kingdom
floracita
though
strikingly
handsome
was
of
a
model
less
superb
than
her
elder
sister
she
was
a
charming
little
brunette
with
laughter
always
lurking
in
ambush
within
her
sparkling
black
eyes
a
mouth
like
cupid
bow
carved
in
coral
and
dimples
in
her
cheeks
that
well
deserved
their
french
name
these
radiant
visions
of
beauty
took
alfred
king
so
much
by
surprise
that
he
was
for
a
moment
confused
but
he
soon
recovered
and
after
the
usual
salutations
took
a
seat
offered
him
near
a
window
overlooking
the
garden
while
the
commonplaces
of
conversation
were
interchanged
he
could
not
but
notice
the
floral
appearance
of
the
room
the
ample
white
lace
curtains
were
surmounted
by
festoons
of
artificial
roses
caught
up
by
a
bird
of
paradise
on
the
ceiling
was
an
exquisitely
painted
garland
from
the
centre
of
which
hung
a
tasteful
basket
of
natural
flowers
with
delicate
drooping
over
its
edge
the
walls
were
papered
with
bright
arabesques
of
flowers
interspersed
with
birds
and
butterflies
in
one
corner
a
statuette
of
flora
looked
down
upon
a
geranium
covered
with
a
profusion
of
rich
blossoms
in
the
opposite
corner
ivy
was
trained
to
form
a
dark
background
for
canova
dancer
in
repose
over
whose
arm
was
thrown
a
wreath
of
interwoven
vines
and
on
brackets
and
tables
were
a
variety
of
natural
flowers
in
vases
of
sevres
china
whereon
the
best
artists
of
france
had
painted
flowers
in
all
manner
of
graceful
combinations
the
ottomans
were
embroidered
with
flowers
rosabella
white
muslin
dress
was
trailed
all
over
with
delicately
tinted
roses
and
the
lace
around
the
corsage
was
fastened
in
front
with
a
mosaic
basket
of
flowers
floracita
black
curls
fell
over
her
shoulders
mixed
with
crimson
fuchsias
and
on
each
of
her
little
slippers
was
embroidered
a
bouquet
this
is
the
temple
of
flora
said
alfred
turning
to
his
host
flowers
everywhere
natural
flowers
artificial
flowers
painted
flowers
embroidered
flowers
and
human
flowers
excelling
them
all
glancing
at
the
young
ladies
as
he
spoke
royal
sighed
and
in
an
absent
sort
of
way
answered
yes
yes
then
starting
up
he
said
abruptly
excuse
me
a
moment
i
wish
to
give
the
servants
some
directions
floracita
who
was
cutting
leaves
from
the
geranium
observed
his
quick
movement
and
as
he
left
the
room
she
turned
toward
their
visitor
and
said
in
a
childlike
confidential
sort
of
way
our
dear
mamita
used
to
call
this
room
the
temple
of
flora
she
had
a
great
passion
for
flowers
she
chose
the
paper
she
made
the
garlands
for
the
curtains
she
embroidered
the
ottomans
and
painted
that
table
so
prettily
papasito
likes
to
have
things
remain
as
she
arranged
them
but
sometimes
they
make
him
sad
for
the
angels
took
mamita
away
from
us
two
years
ago
even
the
names
she
gave
you
are
flowery
said
alfred
with
an
expression
of
mingled
sympathy
and
admiration
yes
and
we
had
a
great
many
flowery
beside
replied
she
my
name
is
flora
but
when
she
was
very
loving
with
me
she
called
me
her
floracita
her
little
flower
and
papasito
always
calls
me
so
now
sometimes
mamita
called
me
in
english
we
call
that
bright
little
flower
rejoined
alfred
smiling
as
he
looked
down
upon
the
lively
little
fairy
she
returned
the
smile
with
an
arch
glance
that
seemed
to
say
i
do
it
though
and
away
she
skipped
to
meet
her
father
whose
returning
steps
were
heard
you
see
i
spoil
her
said
he
as
she
led
him
into
the
room
with
a
step
but
how
can
i
help
it
before
there
was
time
to
respond
to
this
question
the
negress
with
the
bright
turban
announced
that
tea
was
ready
yes
tulipa
we
will
come
said
floracita
is
a
flower
too
asked
alfred
yes
she
a
flower
too
answered
floracita
with
a
merry
little
laugh
we
named
her
so
because
she
always
wears
a
red
and
yellow
turban
but
we
call
her
tulee
for
short
while
they
were
partaking
of
refreshments
she
and
her
father
were
perpetually
exchanging
badinage
which
childish
as
it
was
served
to
enliven
the
repast
but
when
she
began
to
throw
oranges
for
him
to
catch
a
reproving
glance
from
her
dignified
sister
reminded
her
of
the
presence
of
company
let
her
do
as
she
likes
rosa
dear
said
her
father
she
is
used
to
being
my
little
plaything
and
i
ca
spare
her
to
be
a
woman
yet
i
consider
it
a
compliment
to
forget
that
i
am
a
stranger
said
king
for
my
own
part
i
forgot
it
entirely
before
i
had
been
in
the
house
ten
minutes
rosabella
thanked
him
with
a
quiet
smile
and
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
floracita
notwithstanding
this
encouragement
paused
in
her
merriment
and
royal
began
to
talk
over
reminiscences
connected
with
alfred
father
when
they
rose
from
table
he
said
come
here
mignonne
we
wo
be
afraid
of
the
boston
gentleman
will
we
floracita
sprang
to
his
side
he
passed
his
arm
fondly
round
her
and
waiting
for
his
guest
and
his
elder
daughter
to
precede
them
they
returned
to
the
room
they
had
left
they
had
scarcely
entered
it
when
floracita
darted
to
the
window
and
peering
forth
into
the
twilight
she
looked
back
roguishly
at
her
sister
and
began
to
sing
un
petit
blanc
que
en
ces
lieux
est
venu
oui
oui
lui
même
lui
je
vue
petit
blanc
mon
bon
frère
ha
ha
petit
blanc
si
doux
the
progress
of
her
song
was
checked
by
the
entrance
of
a
gentleman
who
was
introduced
to
alfred
as
fitzgerald
from
savannah
his
handsome
person
reminded
one
of
an
italian
tenor
singer
and
his
manner
was
a
graceful
mixture
of
and
insinuating
courtesy
after
a
brief
interchange
of
salutations
he
said
to
floracita
i
heard
some
notes
of
a
lively
little
french
tune
that
went
so
trippingly
i
should
be
delighted
to
hear
more
of
it
floracita
had
accidentally
overheard
some
words
which
fitzgerald
had
addressed
to
her
sister
during
his
last
visit
and
thinking
she
had
discovered
an
important
secret
she
was
disposed
to
use
her
power
mischievously
without
waiting
for
a
repetition
of
his
request
she
sang
petit
blanc
mon
bon
frère
ha
ha
petit
blanc
si
doux
il
a
rien
sur
la
terre
de
si
joli
que
vous
while
she
was
singing
she
darted
roguish
glances
at
her
sister
whose
cheeks
glowed
like
the
side
of
a
golden
apricot
her
father
touched
her
shoulder
and
said
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
sing
that
foolish
song
mignonne
she
turned
to
him
quickly
with
a
look
of
surprise
for
she
was
accustomed
only
to
endearments
from
him
in
answer
to
her
look
he
added
in
a
gentler
tone
you
know
i
told
you
i
wanted
my
friend
to
see
you
dance
select
one
of
your
prettiest
and
rosabella
will
play
it
for
you
fitzgerald
assiduously
placed
the
and
bent
over
the
portfolio
while
miss
royal
searched
for
the
music
a
servant
lighted
the
candelabra
and
drew
the
curtains
alfred
glancing
at
royal
saw
he
was
watching
the
pair
who
were
busy
at
the
portfolio
and
that
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
troubled
his
eyes
however
soon
had
pleasanter
occupation
for
as
soon
as
rosa
touched
the
piano
floracita
began
to
float
round
the
room
in
a
succession
of
graceful
whirls
as
if
the
music
had
taken
her
up
and
was
waltzing
her
along
as
she
passed
the
marble
dancing
girl
she
seized
the
wreath
that
was
thrown
over
its
arm
and
as
she
went
circling
round
it
seemed
as
if
the
tune
had
become
a
visible
spirit
and
that
the
garland
was
a
floating
accompaniment
to
its
graceful
motions
sometimes
it
was
held
aloft
by
the
right
hand
sometimes
by
the
left
sometimes
it
was
a
whirling
semicircle
behind
her
and
sometimes
it
rested
on
her
shoulders
mingling
its
white
orange
buds
and
blossoms
with
her
shower
of
black
curls
and
crimson
fuchsias
now
it
was
twined
round
her
head
in
a
flowery
crown
and
then
it
gracefully
unwound
itself
as
if
it
were
a
thing
alive
ever
and
anon
the
little
dancer
poised
herself
for
an
instant
on
the
point
of
one
fairy
foot
her
cheeks
glowing
with
exercise
and
dimpling
with
smiles
as
she
met
her
father
delighted
gaze
every
attitude
seemed
spontaneous
in
its
prettiness
as
if
the
music
had
made
it
without
her
choice
at
last
she
danced
toward
her
father
and
sank
with
a
motion
on
the
ottoman
at
his
feet
he
patted
the
glossy
head
that
nestled
lovingly
on
his
knee
and
drawing
a
long
breath
as
if
oppressed
with
happiness
he
murmured
ah
mignonne
the
floating
fairy
vision
had
given
such
exquisite
pleasure
that
all
had
been
absorbed
in
watching
its
variations
now
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
you
would
make
taglioni
jealous
said
fitzgerald
addressing
the
little
dancer
and
king
silently
thanked
her
with
a
very
expressive
glance
as
rosabella
retired
from
the
piano
she
busied
herself
with
rearranging
a
bouquet
she
had
taken
from
one
of
the
vases
when
fitzgerald
stationed
himself
at
her
side
she
lowered
her
eyes
with
a
perceptibly
deepening
color
on
her
peculiar
complexion
a
blush
showed
like
a
roseate
cloud
in
a
golden
atmosphere
as
alfred
gazed
on
the
long
dark
silky
fringes
resting
on
those
warmly
tinted
cheeks
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
any
human
creature
so
superbly
handsome
nothing
but
music
can
satisfy
us
after
such
dancing
said
fitzgerald
she
looked
up
to
him
with
a
smile
and
alfred
thought
the
rising
of
those
dark
eyelashes
surpassed
their
downcast
expression
as
the
glory
of
morning
sunshine
excels
the
veiled
beauty
of
starlight
shall
i
accompany
you
while
you
sing
brightly
breaks
the
morning
asked
she
that
always
sings
itself
into
my
heart
whenever
you
raise
your
eyes
to
mine
replied
he
in
a
low
tone
as
he
handed
her
to
the
piano
together
they
sang
that
popular
melody
bright
and
joyful
as
sunrise
on
a
world
of
blossoms
then
came
a
tyrolese
song
with
a
double
voice
sounding
like
echoes
from
the
mountains
this
was
followed
by
some
tender
complaining
russian
melodies
novelties
which
fitzgerald
had
brought
on
a
preceding
visit
feeling
they
were
too
much
engrossed
with
each
other
she
said
politely
king
has
not
yet
chosen
any
music
the
moon
becomes
visible
through
the
curtains
replied
he
perhaps
you
will
salute
her
with
diva
that
is
a
favorite
with
us
she
replied
either
flora
or
i
sing
it
almost
every
moonlight
night
she
sang
it
in
very
pure
italian
then
turning
round
on
the
she
looked
at
her
father
and
said
now
what
shall
i
sing
for
you
you
know
dear
what
i
always
love
to
hear
answered
he
with
gentle
touch
she
drew
from
the
keys
a
plaintive
prelude
which
soon
modulated
itself
into
the
light
of
other
days
she
played
and
sang
it
with
so
much
feeling
that
it
seemed
the
voice
of
memory
floating
with
softened
sadness
over
the
waters
of
the
past
the
tune
was
familiar
to
alfred
but
it
had
never
sung
itself
into
his
heart
as
now
i
felt
as
i
did
in
italy
listening
to
a
sounding
from
a
distance
in
the
stillness
of
twilight
said
he
turning
toward
his
host
all
who
hear
rosabella
sing
notice
a
bell
in
her
voice
rejoined
her
father
undoubtedly
it
is
the
voice
of
a
belle
said
fitzgerald
her
father
without
appearing
to
notice
the
commonplace
pun
went
on
to
say
you
do
know
king
what
tricks
she
can
play
with
her
voice
i
call
her
a
musical
ventriloquist
if
you
want
to
hear
the
bell
to
perfection
ask
her
to
sing
the
bell
for
lovely
nell
do
give
me
that
pleasure
said
alfred
persuasively
she
sang
the
pathetic
melody
and
with
voice
and
piano
imitated
to
perfection
the
slow
tolling
of
a
bell
after
a
short
pause
during
which
she
trifled
with
the
keys
while
some
general
remarks
were
passing
she
turned
to
fitzgerald
who
was
leaning
on
the
piano
and
said
what
shall
i
sing
for
it
was
a
simple
question
but
it
pierced
the
heart
of
alfred
king
with
a
strange
new
pain
what
would
he
not
have
given
for
such
a
soft
expression
in
those
glorious
eyes
when
she
looked
at
since
you
are
in
a
ventriloqual
mood
answered
fitzgerald
i
should
like
to
hear
again
what
you
played
the
last
time
i
was
here
agatha
moonlight
prayer
from
she
smiled
and
with
voice
and
instrument
produced
the
indescribably
dreamy
effect
of
the
two
flutes
it
was
the
very
moonlight
of
sound
this
is
perfectly
magical
murmured
alfred
he
spoke
in
a
low
almost
reverential
tone
for
the
spell
of
moonlight
was
on
him
and
the
clear
soft
voice
of
the
singer
the
novelty
of
her
peculiar
beauty
and
the
surpassing
gracefulness
of
her
motions
as
she
swayed
gently
to
the
music
of
the
tones
she
produced
inspired
him
with
a
feeling
of
poetic
deference
through
the
partially
open
window
came
the
lulling
sound
of
a
little
trickling
fountain
in
the
garden
and
the
air
was
redolent
of
jasmine
and
on
the
was
a
little
sleeping
cupid
from
whose
torch
rose
the
fragrant
incense
of
a
nearly
extinguished
the
pervasive
spirit
of
beauty
in
the
room
manifested
in
forms
colors
tones
and
motions
affected
the
soul
as
perfume
did
the
senses
the
visitors
felt
they
had
stayed
too
long
and
yet
they
lingered
alfred
examined
the
reclining
cupid
and
praised
the
gracefulness
of
its
outline
cupid
could
never
sleep
here
nor
would
the
flame
of
his
torch
ever
go
out
said
fitzgerald
but
it
is
time
were
going
out
the
young
gentlemen
exchanged
parting
salutations
with
their
host
and
his
daughters
and
moved
toward
the
door
but
fitzgerald
paused
on
the
threshold
to
say
please
play
us
out
with
mozart
night
as
organists
play
worshippers
out
of
the
church
added
king
rosabella
bowed
compliance
and
as
they
crossed
the
outer
threshold
they
heard
the
most
musical
of
voices
singing
mozart
beautiful
little
melody
buona
notte
amato
bene
the
young
men
lingered
near
the
piazza
till
the
last
sounds
floated
away
and
then
they
walked
forth
in
the
moonlight
fitzgerald
repeating
the
air
in
a
subdued
whistle
his
first
exclamation
was
is
that
girl
a
rose
royal
she
is
indeed
replied
king
and
the
younger
sister
is
also
extremely
fascinating
yes
i
thought
you
seemed
to
think
so
rejoined
his
companion
which
do
you
prefer
shy
of
revealing
his
thoughts
to
a
stranger
king
replied
that
each
of
the
sisters
was
so
perfect
in
her
way
the
other
would
be
wronged
by
preference
yes
they
are
both
rare
gems
of
beauty
rejoined
fitzgerald
if
i
were
the
grand
bashaw
i
would
have
them
both
in
my
harem
the
levity
of
the
remark
jarred
on
the
feelings
of
his
companion
who
answered
in
a
grave
and
somewhat
cold
tone
i
saw
nothing
in
the
manners
of
the
young
ladies
to
suggest
such
a
disposition
of
them
excuse
me
said
fitzgerald
laughing
i
forgot
you
were
from
the
land
of
puritans
i
meant
no
indignity
to
the
young
ladies
i
assure
you
but
when
one
amuses
himself
with
imagining
the
impossible
it
is
not
worth
while
to
be
scrupulous
about
details
i
am
the
grand
bashaw
and
when
i
pronounced
them
fit
for
his
harem
i
merely
meant
a
compliment
to
their
superlative
beauty
that
floracita
is
a
mischievous
little
sprite
did
you
ever
see
anything
more
roguish
than
her
expression
while
she
was
singing
blanc
mon
bon
frère
that
mercurial
little
song
excited
my
curiosity
replied
alfred
pray
what
is
its
origin
i
think
it
likely
it
came
from
the
french
west
indies
said
fitzgerald
it
seems
to
be
the
of
a
young
negress
addressed
to
a
white
lover
floracita
may
have
learned
it
from
her
mother
who
was
half
french
half
spanish
you
doubtless
observed
the
foreign
sprinkling
in
their
talk
they
told
me
they
never
spoke
english
with
their
mother
those
who
have
seen
her
describe
her
as
a
wonderful
creature
who
danced
like
taglioni
and
sang
like
malibran
and
was
more
beautiful
than
her
daughter
rosabella
but
the
last
part
of
the
story
is
incredible
if
she
were
half
as
handsome
no
wonder
royal
idolized
her
as
they
say
he
did
did
he
marry
her
in
the
french
islands
inquired
alfred
they
were
not
married
answered
fitzgerald
of
course
not
for
she
was
a
quadroon
but
here
are
my
lodgings
and
i
must
bid
you
good
night
these
careless
parting
words
produced
great
disturbance
in
the
spirit
of
alfred
king
he
had
heard
of
those
quadroon
connections
as
one
hears
of
foreign
customs
without
any
realizing
sense
of
their
consequences
that
his
father
friend
should
be
a
partner
in
such
an
alliance
and
that
these
two
graceful
and
accomplished
girls
should
by
that
circumstance
be
excluded
from
the
society
they
would
so
greatly
ornament
surprised
and
bewildered
him
he
recalled
that
tinge
in
rosa
complexion
not
golden
but
like
a
faint
luminous
reflection
of
gold
and
that
slight
waviness
in
the
glossy
hair
which
seemed
to
him
so
becoming
he
could
not
make
these
peculiarities
seem
less
beautiful
to
his
imagination
now
that
he
knew
them
as
signs
of
her
connection
with
a
proscribed
race
and
that
bewitching
little
floracita
emerging
into
womanhood
with
the
auroral
light
of
childhood
still
floating
round
her
she
seemed
like
a
beautiful
italian
child
whose
proper
place
was
among
fountains
and
statues
and
pictured
forms
of
art
the
skill
of
no
parisian
could
produce
a
result
so
pleasing
as
the
profusion
of
raven
hair
that
roll
itself
into
ringlets
octoroons
he
repeated
the
word
to
himself
but
it
did
not
disenchant
him
it
was
merely
something
foreign
and
new
to
his
experience
like
spanish
or
italian
beauty
yet
he
felt
painfully
the
false
position
in
which
they
were
placed
by
the
unreasoning
prejudice
of
society
though
he
had
had
a
fatiguing
day
when
he
entered
his
chamber
he
felt
no
inclination
to
sleep
as
he
slowly
paced
up
and
down
the
room
he
thought
to
himself
my
good
mother
shares
the
prejudice
how
could
i
introduce
them
to
then
as
if
impatient
with
himself
he
murmured
in
a
vexed
tone
why
should
i
of
introducing
them
to
my
mother
a
few
hours
ago
i
did
know
of
their
existence
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
but
memory
was
too
busy
with
the
scene
of
enchantment
he
had
recently
left
a
threw
its
shadow
on
the
curtain
he
began
to
count
the
wavering
leaves
in
hopes
the
monotonous
occupation
would
induce
slumber
after
a
while
he
forgot
to
count
and
as
his
spirit
hovered
between
the
inner
and
the
outer
world
floracita
seemed
to
be
dancing
on
the
leaf
shadows
in
manifold
graceful
evolutions
then
he
was
watching
a
little
trickling
fountain
and
the
falling
drops
were
tones
of
the
light
of
other
days
anon
he
was
wandering
among
flowers
in
the
moonlight
and
from
afar
some
one
was
heard
singing
casta
diva
the
memory
of
that
voice
while
slept
the
limbs
and
senses
all
made
everything
seem
musical
again
and
again
the
panorama
of
the
preceding
evening
revolved
through
the
halls
of
memory
with
every
variety
of
fantastic
change
a
light
laugh
broke
in
upon
the
scenes
of
enchantment
with
the
words
of
course
not
for
she
was
a
quadroon
then
the
plaintive
melody
of
toll
the
bell
resounded
in
his
ears
not
afar
off
but
loud
and
clear
as
if
the
singer
were
in
the
room
he
woke
with
a
start
and
heard
the
vibrations
of
a
cathedral
bell
subsiding
into
silence
it
had
struck
but
twice
but
in
his
spiritual
ear
the
sounds
had
been
modulated
through
many
tones
even
thus
strangely
thought
he
has
that
rich
sonorous
voice
struck
into
the
dream
of
my
life
again
he
saw
those
large
lustrous
eyes
lowering
their
veils
under
the
ardent
gaze
of
gerald
fitzgerald
again
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
sighed
at
last
a
dreamless
sleep
stole
over
him
and
both
pleasure
and
pain
were
buried
in
deep
oblivion
chapter
ii
the
sun
was
up
before
he
woke
he
rose
hastily
and
ordered
breakfast
and
a
horse
for
he
had
resolved
the
day
before
upon
an
early
ride
a
restless
undefined
feeling
led
him
in
the
same
direction
he
had
taken
the
preceding
evening
he
passed
the
house
that
would
forevermore
be
a
prominent
feature
in
the
landscape
of
his
life
vines
were
gently
waving
in
the
morning
air
between
the
pillars
of
the
piazza
where
he
had
lingered
entranced
to
hear
the
tones
of
buena
notte
the
bright
turban
of
tulipa
was
glancing
about
as
she
dusted
the
blinds
a
peacock
on
the
balustrade
in
the
sunshine
spread
out
his
tail
into
a
great
oriental
fan
and
slowly
lowered
it
making
a
prismatic
shower
of
topaz
sapphires
and
emeralds
as
it
fell
it
was
the
first
of
march
but
as
he
rode
on
thinking
of
the
dreary
landscape
and
boisterous
winds
of
new
england
at
that
season
the
air
was
filled
with
the
fragrance
of
flowers
and
and
thrushes
saluted
him
with
their
songs
in
many
places
the
ground
was
thickly
strewn
with
oranges
and
the
were
beautiful
with
golden
fruit
and
silver
flowers
gleaming
among
the
dark
glossy
green
foliage
here
and
there
was
the
mansion
of
a
wealthy
planter
surrounded
by
whitewashed
the
negroes
at
their
work
and
their
black
picaninnies
rolling
about
on
the
ground
seemed
an
appropriate
part
of
the
landscape
so
tropical
in
its
beauty
of
dark
colors
and
luxuriant
growth
he
rode
several
miles
persuading
himself
that
he
was
enticed
solely
by
the
healthy
exercise
and
the
novelty
of
the
scene
but
more
alluring
than
the
pleasant
landscape
and
the
fragrant
air
was
the
hope
that
if
he
returned
late
the
young
ladies
might
be
on
the
piazza
or
visible
at
the
windows
he
was
destined
to
be
disappointed
as
he
passed
a
curtain
was
slowly
withdrawn
from
one
of
the
windows
and
revealed
a
vase
of
flowers
he
rode
slowly
in
hopes
of
seeing
a
face
bend
over
the
flowers
but
the
person
who
drew
the
curtain
remained
invisible
on
the
piazza
nothing
was
in
motion
except
the
peacock
strutting
along
stately
as
a
court
beauty
and
drawing
after
him
his
long
train
of
jewelled
plumage
a
voice
joyous
as
a
bobolink
sounded
apparently
from
the
garden
he
could
not
hear
the
words
but
the
lively
tones
at
once
suggested
petit
blanc
mon
bon
frère
he
recalled
the
words
so
carelessly
uttered
of
course
not
for
she
was
a
quadroon
and
they
seemed
to
make
harsh
discord
with
the
refrain
of
the
song
he
remembered
the
vivid
flush
that
passed
over
rosa
face
while
her
playful
sister
teased
her
with
that
tuneful
badinage
it
seemed
to
him
that
fitzgerald
was
well
aware
of
his
power
for
he
had
not
attempted
to
conceal
his
consciousness
of
the
mischievous
intent
this
train
of
thought
was
arrested
by
the
inward
question
what
is
it
to
whether
he
marries
her
or
not
impatiently
he
touched
his
horse
with
the
whip
as
if
he
wanted
to
rush
from
the
answer
to
his
own
query
he
had
engaged
to
meet
royal
at
his
and
he
was
careful
to
keep
the
appointment
he
was
received
with
parental
kindness
slightly
tinged
with
embarrassment
after
some
conversation
about
business
royal
said
from
your
silence
concerning
your
visit
to
my
house
last
evening
i
infer
that
fitzgerald
has
given
you
some
information
relating
to
my
daughters
history
i
trust
my
young
friend
that
you
have
not
suspected
me
of
any
intention
to
deceive
or
entrap
you
i
intended
to
have
told
you
myself
but
i
had
a
desire
to
know
first
how
my
daughters
would
impress
you
if
judged
by
their
own
merits
having
been
forestalled
in
my
purpose
i
am
afraid
frankness
on
your
part
will
now
be
difficult
a
feeling
of
embarrassment
did
indeed
prevent
me
from
alluding
to
my
visit
as
soon
as
i
met
you
this
morning
replied
alfred
but
no
circumstances
could
alter
my
estimate
of
your
daughters
their
beauty
and
gracefulness
exceed
anything
i
have
seen
and
they
are
as
innocent
and
good
as
they
are
beautiful
rejoined
the
father
but
you
can
easily
imagine
that
my
pride
and
delight
in
them
is
much
disturbed
by
anxiety
concerning
their
future
latterly
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
about
closing
business
and
taking
them
to
france
to
reside
but
when
men
get
to
be
so
old
as
i
am
the
process
of
being
transplanted
to
a
foreign
soil
seems
onerous
if
it
were
as
well
for
i
should
greatly
prefer
returning
to
my
native
new
england
they
are
tropical
flowers
observed
alfred
there
is
nothing
northern
in
their
natures
yes
they
are
tropical
flowers
rejoined
the
father
and
my
wish
is
to
place
them
in
perpetual
sunshine
i
doubt
whether
they
could
ever
feel
quite
at
home
far
away
from
jasmines
and
but
climate
is
the
least
of
the
impediments
in
the
way
of
taking
them
to
new
england
their
connection
with
the
enslaved
race
is
so
very
slight
that
it
might
easily
be
concealed
but
the
consciousness
of
practising
concealment
is
always
unpleasant
your
father
was
more
free
from
prejudices
of
all
sorts
than
any
man
i
ever
knew
if
he
were
living
i
would
confide
all
to
him
and
be
guided
implicitly
by
his
advice
you
resemble
him
so
strongly
that
i
have
been
involuntarily
drawn
to
open
my
heart
to
you
as
i
never
thought
to
do
to
so
young
a
man
yet
i
find
the
fulness
of
my
confidence
checked
by
the
fear
of
lowering
myself
in
the
estimation
of
the
son
of
my
dearest
friend
but
perhaps
if
you
knew
all
the
circumstances
and
had
had
my
experience
you
would
find
some
extenuation
of
my
fault
i
was
very
unhappy
when
i
first
came
to
new
orleans
i
was
devotedly
attached
to
a
young
lady
and
i
was
rudely
repelled
by
her
proud
and
worldly
family
i
was
seized
with
a
vehement
desire
to
prove
to
them
that
i
could
become
richer
than
they
were
i
rushed
madly
into
the
pursuit
of
wealth
and
i
was
successful
but
meanwhile
they
had
married
her
to
another
and
i
found
that
wealth
alone
could
not
bring
happiness
in
vain
the
profits
of
my
business
doubled
and
quadrupled
i
was
unsatisfied
lonely
and
sad
commercial
transactions
brought
me
into
intimate
relations
with
señor
gonsalez
a
spanish
gentleman
in
augustine
he
had
formed
an
alliance
with
a
beautiful
slave
whom
he
had
bought
in
the
french
west
indies
i
never
saw
her
for
she
died
before
my
acquaintance
with
him
but
their
daughter
then
a
girl
of
sixteen
was
the
most
charming
creature
i
ever
beheld
the
irresistible
attraction
i
felt
toward
her
the
first
moment
i
saw
her
was
doubtless
the
mere
fascination
of
the
senses
but
when
i
came
to
know
her
more
i
found
her
so
gentle
so
tender
so
modest
and
so
true
that
i
loved
her
with
a
strong
and
deep
affection
i
admired
her
too
for
other
reasons
than
her
beauty
for
she
had
many
elegant
accomplishments
procured
by
her
fond
indulgence
during
two
years
residence
in
paris
he
was
wealthy
at
that
time
but
he
afterward
became
entangled
in
pecuniary
difficulties
and
his
health
declined
he
took
a
liking
to
me
and
proposed
that
i
should
purchase
eulalia
and
thus
enable
him
to
cancel
a
debt
due
to
a
troublesome
creditor
whom
he
suspected
of
having
an
eye
upon
his
daughter
i
gave
him
a
large
sum
for
her
and
brought
her
with
me
to
new
orleans
do
not
despise
me
for
it
my
young
friend
if
it
had
been
told
to
me
a
few
years
before
in
my
new
england
home
that
i
could
ever
become
a
party
in
such
a
transaction
i
should
have
rejected
the
idea
with
indignation
but
my
disappointed
and
lonely
condition
rendered
me
an
easy
prey
to
temptation
and
i
was
where
public
opinion
sanctioned
such
connections
besides
there
were
kindly
motives
mixed
up
with
selfish
ones
i
pitied
the
unfortunate
father
and
i
feared
his
handsome
daughter
might
fall
into
hands
that
would
not
protect
her
so
carefully
as
i
resolved
to
do
i
knew
the
freedom
of
her
choice
was
not
interfered
with
for
she
confessed
she
loved
me
señor
gonsalez
who
was
more
attached
to
her
than
to
anything
else
in
the
world
soon
afterward
gathered
up
the
fragments
of
his
broken
fortune
and
came
to
reside
near
us
i
know
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
his
dying
hours
that
he
left
eulalia
in
my
care
and
the
dear
girl
was
entirely
happy
with
me
if
i
had
manumitted
her
carried
her
abroad
and
legally
married
her
i
should
have
no
remorse
mingled
with
my
sorrow
for
her
loss
loving
her
faithfully
as
i
did
to
the
latest
moment
of
her
life
i
now
find
it
difficult
to
explain
to
myself
how
i
came
to
neglect
such
an
obvious
duty
i
was
always
thinking
that
i
would
do
it
at
some
future
time
but
marriage
with
a
quadroon
would
have
been
void
according
to
the
laws
of
louisiana
and
being
immersed
in
business
i
never
seemed
to
find
time
to
take
her
abroad
when
one
has
taken
the
first
wrong
step
it
becomes
dangerously
easy
to
go
on
in
the
same
path
a
man
standing
here
is
not
injured
by
such
irregular
connections
and
my
faithful
loving
eulalia
meekly
accepted
her
situation
as
a
portion
of
her
inherited
destiny
mine
was
the
fault
not
hers
for
i
was
free
to
do
as
i
pleased
and
she
never
had
been
i
acted
in
opposition
to
moral
principles
which
the
education
of
false
circumstances
had
given
her
no
opportunity
to
form
i
had
remorseful
thoughts
at
times
but
i
am
quite
sure
she
was
never
troubled
in
that
way
she
loved
and
trusted
me
entirely
she
knew
that
the
marriage
of
a
white
man
with
one
of
her
race
was
illegal
and
she
quietly
accepted
the
fact
as
human
beings
do
accept
what
they
are
powerless
to
overcome
her
daughters
attributed
her
olive
complexion
to
a
spanish
origin
and
their
only
idea
was
and
is
that
she
was
my
honored
wife
as
indeed
she
was
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
my
heart
i
gradually
withdrew
from
the
few
acquaintances
i
had
formed
in
new
orleans
partly
because
i
was
satisfied
with
the
company
of
eulalia
and
our
children
and
partly
because
i
could
not
take
her
with
me
into
society
she
had
no
acquaintances
here
and
we
acquired
the
habit
of
living
in
a
little
world
by
ourselves
a
world
which
as
you
have
seen
was
transformed
into
a
sort
of
by
her
love
of
beautiful
things
after
i
lost
her
it
was
my
intention
to
send
the
children
immediately
to
france
to
be
educated
but
procrastination
is
my
besetting
sin
and
the
idea
of
parting
with
them
was
so
painful
that
i
have
deferred
and
deferred
it
the
suffering
i
experience
on
their
account
is
a
just
punishment
for
the
wrong
i
did
their
mother
when
i
think
how
beautiful
how
talented
how
affectionate
and
how
pure
they
are
and
in
what
a
cruel
position
i
have
placed
them
i
have
terrible
writhings
of
the
heart
i
do
not
think
i
am
destined
to
long
life
and
who
will
protect
them
when
i
am
gone
a
consciousness
of
last
night
wishes
and
dreams
made
alfred
blush
as
he
said
it
occurred
to
me
that
your
eldest
daughter
might
be
betrothed
to
mr
fitzgerald
i
hope
not
quickly
rejoined
royal
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
with
whom
i
would
like
to
intrust
her
happiness
i
think
if
it
were
so
rosabella
would
have
told
me
for
my
children
always
confide
in
me
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
liked
him
replied
alfred
for
you
said
an
introduction
to
your
home
was
a
favor
you
rarely
bestowed
i
never
conferred
it
on
any
young
man
but
yourself
answered
royal
and
you
owed
it
partly
to
my
memory
of
your
honest
father
and
partly
to
the
expression
of
your
face
which
so
much
resembles
his
the
young
man
smiled
and
bowed
and
his
friend
continued
when
i
invited
you
i
was
not
aware
fitzgerald
was
in
the
city
i
am
but
slightly
acquainted
with
him
but
i
conjecture
him
to
be
what
is
called
a
his
manners
though
elegant
seem
to
me
flippant
and
audacious
he
introduced
himself
into
my
domestic
sanctum
and
as
i
partook
of
his
father
hospitality
years
ago
i
find
it
difficult
to
eject
him
he
came
here
a
few
months
since
to
transact
some
business
connected
with
the
settlement
of
his
father
estate
and
unfortunately
he
heard
rosabella
singing
as
he
rode
past
my
house
he
made
inquiries
concerning
the
occupants
and
from
what
i
have
heard
i
conjecture
that
he
has
learned
more
of
my
private
history
than
i
wished
to
have
him
know
he
called
without
asking
my
permission
and
told
my
girls
that
his
father
was
my
friend
and
that
he
had
consequently
taken
the
liberty
to
call
with
some
new
music
which
he
was
very
desirous
of
hearing
them
sing
when
i
was
informed
of
this
on
my
return
home
i
was
exceedingly
annoyed
and
i
have
ever
since
been
thinking
of
closing
business
as
soon
as
possible
and
taking
my
daughters
to
france
he
called
twice
again
during
his
stay
in
the
city
but
my
daughters
made
it
a
point
to
see
him
only
when
i
was
at
home
now
he
has
come
again
to
increase
the
difficulties
of
my
position
by
his
unwelcome
assiduities
unwelcome
to
rejoined
alfred
but
handsome
and
fascinating
as
he
is
they
are
not
likely
to
be
unwelcome
to
your
daughters
your
purpose
of
conveying
them
to
france
is
a
wise
one
would
i
had
done
it
sooner
exclaimed
royal
how
weak
i
have
been
in
allowing
circumstances
to
drift
me
along
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
agitated
steps
then
pausing
before
alfred
he
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
his
shoulder
as
he
said
with
solemn
earnestness
my
young
friend
i
am
glad
your
father
did
not
accept
my
proposal
to
receive
you
into
partnership
let
me
advise
you
to
live
in
new
england
the
institutions
around
us
have
an
effect
on
character
which
it
is
difficult
to
escape
entirely
bad
customs
often
lead
men
into
wrong
paths
that
was
my
father
reason
for
being
unwilling
i
should
reside
in
new
orleans
replied
alfred
he
said
it
was
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
social
institutions
he
often
used
to
speak
of
having
met
a
number
of
turkish
women
when
he
was
in
the
environs
of
constantinople
they
were
wrapped
up
like
bales
of
cloth
with
two
small
openings
for
their
eyes
mounted
on
camels
and
escorted
by
the
overseer
of
the
harem
the
animal
sound
of
their
chatter
and
giggling
as
they
passed
him
affected
him
painfully
for
it
forced
upon
him
the
idea
what
different
beings
those
women
would
have
been
if
they
had
been
brought
up
amid
the
free
churches
and
free
schools
of
new
england
he
always
expounded
history
to
me
in
the
light
of
that
conviction
and
he
mourned
that
temporary
difficulties
should
prevent
lawgivers
from
checking
the
growth
of
evils
that
must
have
a
blighting
influence
on
the
souls
of
many
generations
he
considered
slavery
a
cumulative
poison
in
the
veins
of
this
republic
and
predicted
that
it
would
some
day
act
all
at
once
with
deadly
power
your
father
was
a
wise
man
replied
royal
and
i
agree
with
him
but
it
would
be
unsafe
to
announce
it
here
for
slavery
is
a
tabooed
subject
except
to
talk
in
favor
of
it
i
am
well
aware
of
that
rejoined
alfred
and
now
i
must
bid
you
good
morning
you
know
my
mother
is
an
invalid
and
i
may
find
letters
at
the
that
will
render
immediate
return
necessary
but
i
will
see
you
again
and
hereafter
our
acquaintance
may
perhaps
be
renewed
in
france
that
is
a
delightful
hope
rejoined
the
merchant
cordially
returning
the
friendly
pressure
of
his
hand
as
he
looked
after
the
young
man
he
thought
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
have
such
a
son
and
he
sighed
deeply
over
the
vision
of
a
union
that
might
have
been
under
other
circumstances
between
his
family
and
that
of
his
old
friend
alfred
as
he
walked
away
was
conscious
of
that
latent
unspoken
wish
again
the
query
began
to
revolve
through
his
mind
whether
the
impediments
were
really
insurmountable
there
floated
before
him
a
vision
of
that
enchanting
room
where
the
whole
of
life
seemed
to
be
composed
of
beauty
and
gracefulness
music
and
flowers
but
a
shadow
of
fitzgerald
fell
across
it
and
the
recollection
of
boston
relatives
rose
up
like
an
iceberg
between
him
and
a
letter
informing
him
of
his
mother
increasing
illness
excited
a
feeling
of
remorse
that
new
acquaintances
had
temporarily
nearly
driven
her
from
his
thoughts
he
resolved
to
depart
that
evening
but
the
desire
to
see
rosabella
again
could
not
be
suppressed
failing
to
find
royal
at
his
or
his
hotel
he
proceeded
to
his
suburban
residence
when
tulipa
informed
him
that
massa
had
not
returned
from
the
city
he
inquired
for
the
young
ladies
and
was
again
shown
into
that
parlor
every
feature
of
which
was
so
indelibly
impressed
upon
his
memory
portions
of
the
music
of
lay
open
on
the
piano
and
the
leaves
fluttered
softly
in
a
gentle
breeze
laden
with
perfumes
from
the
garden
near
by
was
swinging
the
beaded
tassel
of
a
between
the
pages
of
a
volume
he
looked
at
the
title
and
saw
that
it
was
lalla
rookh
he
smiled
as
he
glanced
round
the
room
on
the
flowery
festoons
the
graceful
tangle
of
bright
arabesques
on
the
walls
the
dancing
girl
and
the
sleeping
cupid
all
is
in
harmony
with
canova
and
moore
and
rossini
thought
he
the
lady
in
milton
comus
been
the
ideal
of
my
imagination
and
now
here
i
am
so
strangely
taken
captive
by
rosabella
entered
at
that
moment
and
almost
startled
him
with
the
contrast
to
his
ideal
her
glowing
oriental
beauty
and
stately
grace
impressed
him
more
than
ever
floracita
fairy
form
and
airy
motions
were
scarcely
less
fascinating
their
talk
was
very
girlish
floracita
had
just
been
reading
in
a
french
paper
about
the
performance
of
and
she
longed
to
see
the
ballet
brought
out
in
paris
rosabella
thought
nothing
could
be
quite
so
romantic
as
to
float
on
the
canals
of
venice
by
moonlight
and
listen
to
the
nightingales
and
she
should
like
to
cross
the
bridge
of
sighs
then
they
went
into
raptures
over
the
gracefulness
of
rossini
music
and
the
brilliancy
of
auber
very
few
and
very
slender
thoughts
were
conveyed
in
their
words
but
to
the
young
man
ear
they
had
the
charm
of
music
for
floracita
talk
went
as
trippingly
as
a
lively
dance
and
the
sweet
modulations
of
rosabella
voice
so
softened
english
to
italian
sound
that
her
words
seemed
floating
on
a
liquid
element
like
goldfish
in
the
water
indeed
her
whole
nature
seemed
to
partake
the
fluid
character
of
music
beauty
born
of
harmonious
sound
had
passed
into
her
face
and
her
motions
reminded
one
of
a
undulating
on
its
native
element
the
necessity
of
returning
immediately
to
boston
was
alfred
apology
for
a
brief
call
repressed
feeling
imparted
great
earnestness
to
the
message
he
left
for
his
father
friend
while
he
was
uttering
it
the
conversation
he
had
recently
had
with
royal
came
back
to
him
with
painful
distinctness
after
parting
compliments
were
exchanged
he
turned
to
say
excuse
me
young
ladies
if
in
memory
of
our
friendship
i
beg
of
you
to
command
my
services
as
if
i
were
a
brother
should
it
ever
be
in
my
power
to
serve
you
rosabella
thanked
him
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
graceful
head
and
floracita
dimpling
a
quick
little
courtesy
said
sportively
if
some
cruel
should
shut
us
up
in
his
castle
we
will
send
for
you
how
funny
exclaimed
the
volatile
child
as
the
door
closed
after
him
he
spoke
as
solemn
as
a
minister
but
i
suppose
that
the
way
with
yankees
i
think
likes
to
preach
sometimes
rosabella
happening
to
glance
at
the
window
saw
that
alfred
king
paused
in
the
street
and
looked
back
how
their
emotions
would
have
deepened
could
they
have
foreseen
the
future
chapter
iii
a
year
passed
away
and
the
early
southern
spring
had
again
returned
with
flowers
and
fragrance
after
a
day
in
music
and
embroidery
with
sundry
games
at
battledoor
and
the
graces
with
her
sister
floracita
heard
the
approaching
footsteps
of
her
father
and
as
usual
bounded
forth
to
meet
him
any
one
who
had
not
seen
him
since
he
parted
from
the
son
of
his
early
new
england
friend
would
have
observed
that
he
looked
older
and
more
careworn
but
his
daughters
accustomed
to
see
him
daily
had
not
noticed
the
gradual
change
you
have
kept
us
waiting
a
little
papasito
said
rosabella
turning
round
on
the
and
greeting
him
with
a
smile
yes
my
darling
rejoined
he
placing
his
hand
fondly
on
her
head
getting
ready
to
go
to
europe
makes
a
deal
of
work
if
we
were
sons
we
could
help
you
said
rosabella
i
wish
you
sons
answered
he
with
serious
emphasis
and
a
deep
sigh
floracita
nestled
close
to
him
and
looking
up
archly
in
his
face
said
and
pray
what
would
you
do
papa
without
your
nightingale
and
your
fairy
as
you
call
us
sure
enough
what
i
do
my
little
flower
said
he
as
with
a
loving
smile
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
they
led
him
to
the
and
when
the
repast
was
ended
they
began
to
talk
over
their
preparations
for
leaving
home
how
long
before
we
shall
go
to
paris
inquired
floracita
in
two
or
three
weeks
i
hope
was
the
reply
wo
it
be
delightful
exclaimed
she
you
will
take
us
to
see
ballets
and
everything
when
i
am
playing
and
singing
fragments
of
operas
said
rosabella
i
often
think
to
myself
how
wonderfully
beautiful
they
would
sound
if
all
the
parts
were
brought
out
by
such
musicians
as
they
have
in
europe
i
should
greatly
enjoy
hearing
operas
in
paris
but
i
often
think
papasito
that
we
can
never
be
so
happy
anywhere
as
we
have
been
in
this
dear
home
it
makes
me
feel
sad
to
leave
all
these
pretty
things
so
many
of
them
she
hesitated
and
glanced
at
her
father
so
intimately
associated
with
your
dear
mother
you
were
about
to
say
replied
he
that
thought
is
often
present
with
me
and
the
idea
of
parting
with
them
pains
me
to
the
heart
but
i
do
not
intend
they
shall
ever
be
handled
by
strangers
we
will
pack
them
carefully
and
leave
them
with
madame
guirlande
and
when
we
get
settled
abroad
in
some
nice
little
cottage
we
will
send
for
them
but
when
you
have
been
in
paris
when
you
have
seen
the
world
and
the
world
has
seen
you
perhaps
you
wo
be
contented
to
live
in
a
cottage
with
your
old
papasito
perhaps
your
heads
will
become
so
turned
with
flattery
that
you
will
want
to
be
at
balls
and
operas
all
the
time
no
flattery
will
be
so
sweet
as
yours
said
floracita
no
indeed
exclaimed
rosa
but
looking
up
she
met
his
eye
and
blushed
crimson
she
was
conscious
of
having
already
listened
to
flattery
that
was
at
least
more
intoxicating
than
his
her
father
noticed
the
rosy
confusion
and
felt
a
renewal
of
pain
that
unexpected
entanglements
had
prevented
his
going
to
europe
months
ago
he
tenderly
pressed
her
hand
that
lay
upon
his
knee
and
looked
at
her
with
troubled
earnestness
as
he
said
now
that
you
are
going
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
world
my
daughters
and
without
a
mother
to
guide
you
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
will
never
believe
any
gentleman
sincere
in
professions
of
love
unless
he
proposes
marriage
and
asks
my
consent
rosabella
was
obviously
agitated
but
she
readily
replied
do
you
suppose
papasito
that
we
would
accept
a
lover
without
asking
you
about
it
when
died
she
charged
us
to
tell
you
everything
and
we
always
do
i
do
not
doubt
you
my
children
he
replied
but
the
world
is
full
of
snares
and
sometimes
they
are
so
covered
with
flowers
that
the
inexperienced
slip
into
them
unawares
i
shall
try
to
shield
you
from
harm
as
i
always
have
done
but
when
i
am
gone
o
do
say
that
exclaimed
floracita
with
a
quick
nervous
movement
and
rosabella
looked
at
him
with
swimming
eyes
as
she
repeated
do
say
that
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
head
of
each
his
heart
was
very
full
with
solemn
tenderness
he
tried
to
warn
them
of
the
perils
of
life
but
there
was
much
that
he
was
obliged
to
refrain
from
saying
from
reverence
for
their
inexperienced
purity
and
had
he
attempted
to
describe
the
manners
of
a
corrupt
world
they
could
have
had
no
realizing
sense
of
his
meaning
for
it
is
impossible
for
youth
to
comprehend
the
dangers
of
the
road
it
is
to
travel
the
long
talk
at
last
subsided
into
serious
silence
after
remaining
very
still
a
few
moments
rosabella
said
softy
would
you
like
to
hear
some
music
before
you
go
to
bed
he
nodded
assent
and
she
moved
to
the
piano
their
conversation
had
produced
an
unusually
tender
and
subdued
state
of
feeling
and
she
sang
quietly
many
plaintive
melodies
that
her
mother
loved
the
fountain
trickling
in
the
garden
kept
up
a
low
liquid
accompaniment
and
the
perfume
of
the
seemed
like
the
fragrant
breath
of
the
tones
it
was
late
when
they
parted
for
the
night
soir
cher
said
floracita
kissing
her
father
hand
noches
papasito
said
rosabella
as
she
touched
his
cheek
with
her
beautiful
lips
there
was
moisture
in
his
eyes
as
he
folded
them
to
his
heart
and
said
god
bless
you
god
protect
you
my
dear
ones
those
melodies
of
past
times
had
brought
their
mother
before
him
in
all
her
loving
trustfulness
and
his
soul
was
full
of
sorrow
for
the
irreparable
wrong
he
had
done
her
children
the
pensive
mood
that
had
enveloped
them
all
in
a
little
cloud
the
preceding
evening
was
gone
in
the
morning
there
was
the
usual
bantering
during
breakfast
and
after
they
rose
from
table
they
discussed
in
a
lively
manner
various
plans
concerning
their
residence
in
france
rosabella
evidently
felt
much
less
pleasure
in
the
prospect
than
did
her
younger
sister
and
her
father
conjecturing
the
reason
was
the
more
anxious
to
expedite
their
departure
i
must
not
linger
here
talking
said
he
i
must
go
and
attend
to
business
for
there
are
many
things
to
be
arranged
before
we
can
set
out
on
our
travels
luego
papasito
said
rosabella
with
an
affectionate
smile
revoir
cher
said
floracita
as
she
handed
him
his
hat
he
patted
her
head
playfully
as
he
said
what
a
polyglot
family
we
are
your
grandfather
spanish
your
grandmother
french
and
your
father
english
all
mixed
up
in
an
good
morning
my
darlings
floracita
skipped
out
on
the
piazza
calling
after
him
papa
what
polyglot
he
turned
and
shook
his
finger
laughingly
at
her
as
he
exclaimed
o
you
little
ignoramus
the
sisters
lingered
on
the
piazza
watching
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
when
they
the
house
floracita
occupied
herself
with
various
articles
of
her
wardrobe
consulting
with
rosa
whether
any
alterations
would
be
necessary
before
they
were
packed
for
france
it
evidently
cost
rosa
some
effort
to
attend
to
her
innumerable
questions
for
the
incessant
chattering
disturbed
her
revery
at
every
interval
she
glanced
round
the
room
with
a
sort
of
farewell
tenderness
it
was
more
to
her
than
the
home
of
a
happy
childhood
for
nearly
all
the
familiar
objects
had
become
associated
with
glances
and
tones
the
memory
of
which
excited
restless
longings
in
her
heart
as
she
stood
gazing
on
the
blooming
garden
and
the
little
fountain
whose
sparkling
rills
crossed
each
other
in
the
sunshine
like
a
silvery
network
strung
with
diamonds
she
exclaimed
o
floracita
we
shall
never
be
so
happy
anywhere
else
as
we
have
been
here
how
do
you
know
that
rejoined
the
lively
little
chatterer
only
think
we
have
never
been
to
a
ball
and
when
we
get
to
france
papasito
will
go
everywhere
with
us
he
says
he
will
i
should
like
to
hear
operas
and
see
ballets
in
paris
said
rosabella
but
i
wish
we
could
come
back
before
long
floracita
laughing
eyes
assumed
the
arch
expression
which
rendered
them
peculiarly
bewitching
and
she
began
to
sing
petit
blanc
mon
bon
frère
ha
ha
petit
blanc
si
doux
il
a
rien
sur
la
terre
de
si
joli
que
vous
un
petit
blanc
que
a
quick
flush
mantled
her
sister
face
and
she
put
her
hand
over
the
mischievous
mouth
exclaiming
do
flora
do
the
roguish
little
creature
went
laughing
and
capering
out
of
the
room
and
her
voice
was
still
heard
singing
un
petit
blanc
que
the
arrival
of
signor
papanti
soon
summoned
her
to
rehearse
a
music
lesson
she
glanced
roguishly
at
her
sister
when
she
began
and
as
she
went
on
rosa
could
not
help
smiling
at
her
musical
antics
the
old
teacher
bore
it
patiently
for
a
while
then
he
stopped
trying
to
accompany
her
and
shaking
his
finger
at
her
said
did
i
make
a
false
note
asked
she
demurely
no
you
little
witch
you
make
a
false
note
but
how
do
you
suppose
i
can
keep
hold
of
the
tail
of
the
air
if
you
send
me
chasing
after
it
through
so
many
capricious
variations
now
begin
again
the
lesson
was
recommenced
but
soon
ran
riot
again
the
signor
became
red
in
the
face
shut
the
with
a
slam
and
poured
forth
a
volley
of
wrath
in
italian
when
she
saw
that
he
was
really
angry
she
apologized
and
promised
to
do
better
the
third
time
of
trying
she
acquitted
herself
so
well
that
her
teacher
praised
her
and
when
she
bade
him
good
morning
with
a
comic
little
courtesy
he
smiled
as
he
said
i
knew
i
should
make
signor
pimentero
sprinkle
some
pepper
exclaimed
she
laughing
as
she
saw
him
walk
away
you
are
too
fond
of
sobriquets
said
rosa
if
you
are
not
careful
you
will
call
him
signor
pimentero
to
his
face
some
day
what
did
you
tell
me
for
asked
the
little
rogue
it
will
just
make
me
do
it
now
i
am
going
to
pester
madame
parrot
she
caught
up
her
large
straw
hat
with
flying
ribbons
and
ran
to
the
house
of
their
next
neighbor
madame
guirlande
she
was
a
french
lady
who
had
given
the
girls
lessons
in
embroidery
the
manufacture
of
artificial
flowers
and
other
before
long
floracita
returned
through
the
garden
skipping
over
a
this
is
a
day
of
compliments
said
she
as
she
entered
the
parlor
signor
pimentero
called
me
madame
guirlande
called
me
petit
and
the
parrot
took
it
up
and
screamed
it
after
me
as
i
came
away
i
do
wonder
at
it
replied
rosa
i
think
i
never
saw
even
you
so
full
of
mischief
her
frolicsome
mood
remained
through
the
day
one
moment
she
assumed
the
dignified
manner
of
rosabella
and
stretching
herself
to
the
utmost
she
stood
very
erect
giving
sage
advice
the
next
she
was
impersonating
a
negro
preacher
one
of
tulipa
friends
hearing
a
in
the
garden
she
went
to
the
window
and
taxed
his
powers
to
the
utmost
by
running
up
and
down
difficult
interspersed
with
the
talk
of
parrots
the
shrill
fanfare
of
trumpets
and
the
deep
growl
of
a
the
bird
produced
a
grotesque
fantasia
in
his
efforts
to
imitate
her
the
peacock
as
he
strutted
up
and
down
the
piazza
trailing
his
gorgeous
plumage
in
the
sunshine
ever
and
anon
turned
his
glossy
neck
and
held
up
his
ear
to
listen
occasionally
performing
his
part
in
the
by
uttering
a
harsh
scream
the
mirthfulness
of
the
little
madcap
was
contagious
and
not
unfrequently
the
giggle
of
tulipa
and
the
low
musical
laugh
of
rosabella
mingled
with
the
concert
thus
the
day
passed
merrily
away
till
the
gilded
flora
that
leaned
against
the
timepiece
pointed
her
wand
toward
the
hour
when
their
father
was
accustomed
to
return
chapter
iv
floracita
was
still
in
the
full
career
of
fun
when
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
and
as
usual
she
bounded
forth
to
welcome
her
father
several
men
bearing
a
palanquin
on
their
shoulders
were
slowly
ascending
the
piazza
she
gave
one
glance
at
their
burden
and
uttered
a
shrill
scream
rosabella
hastened
to
her
in
great
alarm
tulipa
followed
and
quickly
comprehending
that
something
terrible
had
happened
she
hurried
away
to
summon
madame
guirlande
rosabella
pale
and
trembling
gasped
out
what
has
happened
to
my
father
franz
blumenthal
a
favorite
clerk
of
royal
replied
in
a
low
sympathizing
tone
he
was
writing
letters
in
the
this
afternoon
and
when
i
went
in
to
speak
to
him
i
found
him
on
the
floor
senseless
we
called
a
doctor
immediately
but
he
failed
to
restore
him
o
call
another
doctor
said
rosa
imploringly
and
floracita
almost
shrieked
tell
me
where
to
for
a
doctor
we
have
already
summoned
one
on
the
way
said
young
blumenthal
but
i
will
go
to
hasten
him
and
half
blinded
by
his
tears
he
hurried
into
the
street
the
doctor
came
in
two
minutes
and
yet
it
seemed
an
age
meanwhile
the
wretched
girls
were
chafing
their
father
cold
hands
and
holding
to
his
nose
while
madame
guirlande
and
tulipa
were
preparing
hot
water
and
hot
cloths
when
the
physician
arrived
they
watched
his
countenance
anxiously
while
he
felt
the
pulse
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
heart
after
a
while
he
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
can
be
done
he
is
dead
rosabella
fell
forward
fainting
on
the
body
floracita
uttered
shriek
upon
shriek
while
madame
guirlande
and
tulipa
vainly
tried
to
pacify
her
the
doctor
at
last
persuaded
her
to
swallow
some
valerian
and
tulipa
carried
her
in
her
arms
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
madame
guirlande
led
rosa
away
and
the
two
sisters
lay
beside
each
other
on
the
same
pillows
where
they
had
dreamed
such
happy
dreams
the
night
before
floracita
stunned
by
the
blow
that
had
fallen
on
her
so
suddenly
and
rendered
drowsy
by
the
anodyne
she
had
taken
soon
fell
into
an
uneasy
slumber
broken
by
occasional
starts
and
stifled
sobs
rosabella
wept
silently
but
now
and
then
a
shudder
passed
over
her
that
showed
how
hard
she
was
struggling
with
grief
after
a
short
time
flora
woke
up
bewildered
a
lamp
was
burning
in
the
farther
part
of
the
room
and
madame
guirlande
who
sat
there
in
spectacles
and
ruffled
cap
made
a
grotesque
black
shadow
on
the
wall
floracita
started
up
screaming
what
is
that
madame
guirlande
went
to
her
and
she
and
rosa
spoke
soothingly
and
soon
she
remembered
all
o
let
me
go
home
with
she
said
to
madame
i
am
afraid
to
stay
here
yes
my
children
replied
the
good
frenchwoman
you
had
better
both
go
home
and
stay
with
me
i
can
not
go
away
and
leave
alone
murmured
rosa
in
tones
almost
inaudible
franz
blumenthal
is
going
to
remain
here
replied
madame
guirlande
and
tulipa
has
offered
to
sit
up
all
night
it
is
much
better
for
you
to
go
with
me
than
to
stay
here
my
children
thus
exhorted
they
rose
and
began
to
make
preparations
for
departure
but
all
at
once
the
tender
of
the
preceding
evening
rushed
on
rosa
memory
and
she
sank
down
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
after
weeping
bitterly
for
some
minutes
she
sobbed
out
o
this
is
worse
than
it
was
when
mamita
died
papasito
was
so
tender
with
us
then
and
now
we
are
alone
not
all
alone
responded
madame
jesus
and
the
blessed
virgin
are
with
you
o
i
do
know
where
are
exclaimed
flora
in
tones
of
wild
agony
i
want
my
papasito
i
want
to
die
and
go
to
my
papasito
rosabella
folded
her
in
her
arms
and
they
mingled
their
tears
together
as
she
whispered
let
us
try
to
be
tranquil
sistita
we
must
not
be
troublesome
to
our
kind
friend
i
did
wrong
to
say
we
were
all
alone
we
have
always
a
father
in
heaven
and
he
still
spares
us
to
love
each
other
perhaps
too
our
dear
papasito
is
watching
over
us
you
know
he
used
to
tell
us
mamita
had
become
our
guardian
angel
floracita
kissed
her
and
pressed
her
hand
in
silence
then
they
made
preparations
to
go
with
their
friendly
neighbor
all
stepping
very
softly
as
if
afraid
of
waking
the
beloved
sleeper
the
sisters
had
lived
in
such
extreme
seclusion
that
when
sorrow
came
upon
them
like
the
sudden
swoop
and
swift
destruction
of
a
tropical
storm
they
had
no
earthly
friend
to
rely
upon
but
madame
guirlande
only
the
day
before
they
had
been
so
rich
in
love
that
had
she
passed
away
from
the
earth
it
would
have
made
no
distressing
change
in
their
existence
they
would
have
said
poor
madame
guirlande
she
was
a
good
soul
how
patient
she
used
to
be
with
us
and
after
a
day
or
two
they
would
have
danced
and
sung
the
same
as
ever
but
one
day
had
so
beggared
them
in
affection
that
they
leaned
upon
her
as
their
only
earthly
support
after
an
almost
untasted
breakfast
they
all
went
back
to
the
desolated
home
the
flowery
parlor
seemed
awfully
lonesome
the
piano
was
closed
the
curtains
drawn
and
their
father
chair
was
placed
against
the
wall
the
murmur
of
the
fountain
sounded
as
solemn
as
a
dirge
and
memories
filled
the
room
like
a
troop
of
ghosts
hand
in
hand
the
bereaved
ones
went
to
kiss
the
lips
that
would
speak
to
them
no
more
in
this
world
they
knelt
long
beside
the
bed
and
poured
forth
their
breaking
hearts
in
prayer
they
rose
up
soothed
and
strengthened
with
the
feeling
that
their
dear
father
and
mother
were
still
near
them
they
found
a
sad
consolation
in
weaving
garlands
and
flowery
crosses
which
they
laid
on
the
coffin
with
tender
reverence
when
the
day
of
the
funeral
came
madame
guirlande
kept
them
very
near
her
holding
a
hand
of
each
she
had
provided
them
with
long
veils
which
she
requested
them
not
to
remove
for
she
remembered
how
anxiously
their
father
had
screened
their
beauty
from
the
public
gaze
a
number
of
merchants
who
had
known
and
respected
royal
followed
his
remains
to
the
grave
most
of
them
had
heard
of
his
quadroon
connection
and
some
supposed
that
the
veiled
mourners
might
be
his
daughters
but
such
things
were
too
common
to
excite
remark
or
to
awaken
much
interest
the
girls
passed
almost
unnoticed
having
out
of
respect
to
the
wishes
of
their
friend
stifled
their
sobs
till
they
were
alone
in
the
carriage
with
her
and
their
old
the
conviction
that
he
was
not
destined
to
long
life
which
royal
had
expressed
to
alfred
king
was
founded
on
the
opinion
of
physicians
that
his
heart
was
diseased
this
furnished
an
additional
motive
for
closing
his
business
as
soon
as
possible
and
taking
his
children
to
france
but
the
failure
of
several
houses
with
which
he
was
connected
brought
unexpected
entanglements
month
by
month
these
became
more
complicated
and
necessarily
delayed
the
intended
emigration
his
anxiety
concerning
his
daughters
increased
to
an
oppressive
degree
and
aggravated
the
symptoms
of
his
disease
with
his
habitual
desire
to
screen
them
from
everything
unpleasant
he
unwisely
concealed
from
them
both
his
illness
and
his
pecuniary
difficulties
he
knew
he
could
no
longer
be
a
rich
man
but
he
still
had
hope
of
saving
enough
of
his
fortune
to
live
in
a
moderate
way
in
some
cheap
district
of
france
but
on
the
day
when
he
bade
his
daughters
good
morning
so
cheerfully
he
received
a
letter
informing
him
of
another
extensive
failure
which
involved
him
deeply
he
was
alone
in
his
when
he
read
it
and
there
franz
blumenthal
found
him
dead
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
his
sudden
exit
of
course
aroused
the
vigilance
of
creditors
and
their
examination
into
the
state
of
his
affairs
proved
anything
but
satisfactory
the
sisters
unconscious
of
all
this
were
undisturbed
by
any
anxiety
concerning
future
support
the
necessity
of
living
without
their
father
love
and
counsel
weighed
heavily
on
their
spirits
but
concerning
his
money
they
took
no
thought
hitherto
they
had
lived
as
the
birds
do
and
it
did
not
occur
to
them
that
it
could
ever
be
otherwise
the
garden
and
the
flowery
parlor
which
their
mother
had
created
and
their
father
had
so
dearly
loved
seemed
almost
as
much
a
portion
of
themselves
as
their
own
persons
it
had
been
hard
to
think
of
leaving
them
even
for
the
attractions
of
paris
and
now
dream
was
over
it
seemed
a
necessity
of
their
existence
to
live
on
in
the
atmosphere
of
beauty
to
which
they
had
always
been
accustomed
but
now
that
the
sunshine
of
love
had
vanished
from
it
they
felt
lonely
and
unprotected
there
they
invited
madame
guirlande
to
come
and
live
with
them
on
what
terms
she
chose
and
when
she
said
there
ought
to
be
some
elderly
man
in
the
house
they
at
once
suggested
inviting
their
madame
aware
of
the
confidence
royal
had
always
placed
in
him
thought
it
was
the
best
arrangement
that
could
be
made
at
least
for
the
present
while
preparations
were
being
made
to
effect
this
change
her
proceedings
were
suddenly
arrested
by
tidings
that
the
house
and
furniture
were
to
be
sold
at
auction
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
creditors
she
kept
back
the
unwelcome
news
from
the
girls
while
she
held
long
consultations
with
signor
papanti
he
declared
his
opinion
that
rosabella
could
make
a
fortune
by
her
voice
and
floracita
by
dancing
but
then
they
are
so
young
urged
madame
one
only
sixteen
the
other
only
fourteen
youth
is
a
disadvantage
one
soon
outgrows
replied
the
signor
they
ca
make
fortunes
immediately
of
course
but
they
can
earn
a
living
by
giving
lessons
i
will
try
to
open
a
way
for
them
and
the
sooner
you
prepare
them
for
it
the
better
madame
dreaded
the
task
of
disclosing
their
poverty
but
she
found
it
less
painful
than
she
had
feared
they
had
no
realizing
sense
of
what
it
meant
and
rather
thought
that
giving
lessons
would
be
a
pleasant
mode
of
making
time
pass
less
heavily
madame
who
fully
understood
the
condition
of
things
kept
a
watchful
lookout
for
their
interests
before
an
inventory
was
taken
she
gathered
up
and
hid
away
many
trifling
articles
which
would
be
useful
to
them
though
of
little
or
no
value
to
the
creditors
portfolios
of
music
patterns
for
drawings
boxes
of
paint
and
crayons
baskets
of
chenille
for
embroidery
and
a
variety
of
other
things
were
safely
packed
away
out
of
sight
without
the
girls
taking
any
notice
of
her
proceedings
during
her
father
lifetime
floracita
was
so
continually
whirling
round
in
fragmentary
dances
that
he
often
told
her
she
rested
on
her
feet
less
than
a
but
after
he
was
gone
she
remained
very
still
from
morning
till
night
when
madame
spoke
to
her
of
the
necessity
of
giving
it
suggested
the
idea
of
practising
but
she
felt
that
she
could
not
dance
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
dance
before
and
she
had
not
the
heart
to
ask
rosa
to
play
for
her
she
thought
she
would
try
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
how
it
would
seem
to
give
but
without
music
and
without
a
spectator
it
seemed
so
like
the
ghost
of
dancing
that
after
a
few
steps
the
poor
child
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
sobbed
rosa
did
not
open
the
piano
for
several
days
after
the
funeral
but
one
morning
feeling
as
if
it
would
be
a
relief
to
pour
forth
the
sadness
that
oppressed
her
she
began
to
play
languidly
only
requiems
and
prayers
came
half
afraid
of
summoning
an
invisible
spirit
she
softly
touched
the
keys
to
the
light
of
other
days
but
remembering
it
was
the
very
last
tune
she
ever
played
to
her
father
she
leaned
her
head
forward
on
the
instrument
and
wept
bitterly
while
she
sat
thus
the
rang
and
she
soon
became
conscious
of
steps
approaching
the
parlor
her
heart
gave
a
sudden
leap
for
her
first
thought
was
of
gerald
fitzgerald
she
raised
her
head
wiped
away
her
tears
and
rose
to
receive
the
visitor
three
strangers
entered
she
bowed
to
them
and
they
with
a
little
look
of
surprise
bowed
to
her
what
do
you
wish
for
gentlemen
she
asked
we
are
here
concerning
the
settlement
of
royal
estate
replied
one
of
them
we
have
been
appointed
to
take
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
while
he
spoke
one
of
his
companions
was
inspecting
the
piano
to
see
who
was
the
maker
and
another
was
examining
the
timepiece
it
was
too
painful
and
rosa
without
trusting
herself
to
speak
another
word
walked
quietly
out
of
the
room
the
gathering
moisture
in
her
eyes
making
it
difficult
for
her
to
guide
her
steps
is
that
one
of
the
daughters
we
have
heard
spoken
of
inquired
one
of
the
gentlemen
i
judge
so
rejoined
his
companion
what
a
royal
beauty
she
is
good
for
three
thousand
i
should
say
more
likely
five
thousand
added
the
third
such
a
fancy
article
as
that
do
appear
in
the
market
once
in
fifty
years
look
here
said
the
first
speaker
do
you
see
that
pretty
little
creature
crossing
the
garden
i
reckon
that
the
other
daughter
they
bring
high
prices
continued
the
third
speaker
the
best
property
royal
has
left
we
may
count
them
eight
or
ten
thousand
at
least
some
of
our
rich
fanciers
would
jump
at
the
chance
of
obtaining
of
them
for
that
price
as
he
spoke
he
looked
significantly
at
the
first
speaker
who
refrained
from
expressing
any
opinion
concerning
their
pecuniary
value
all
unconscious
of
the
remarks
she
had
elicited
rosa
retired
to
her
chamber
where
she
sat
at
the
window
plunged
in
mournful
revery
she
was
thinking
of
various
articles
her
mother
had
painted
and
embroidered
and
how
her
father
had
said
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
their
being
handled
by
strangers
presently
floracita
came
running
in
saying
in
a
flurried
way
who
are
those
men
down
stairs
rosa
i
do
know
who
they
are
replied
her
sister
they
said
they
came
to
take
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
i
do
know
what
right
they
have
to
do
it
i
wish
madame
would
come
i
will
run
and
call
her
said
floracita
no
you
had
better
stay
with
me
replied
rosa
i
was
just
going
to
look
for
you
when
you
came
in
i
ran
into
the
parlor
first
thinking
you
were
there
rejoined
floracita
i
saw
one
of
those
men
turning
over
mamita
embroidered
ottoman
and
chalking
something
on
it
how
dear
papa
would
have
felt
if
he
had
seen
it
one
of
them
looked
at
me
in
such
a
strange
way
i
do
know
what
he
meant
but
it
made
me
want
to
run
away
in
a
minute
hark
i
do
believe
they
have
come
up
stairs
and
are
in
papa
room
they
wo
come
here
will
they
bolt
the
door
exclaimed
rosa
and
it
was
quickly
done
they
sat
folded
in
each
other
arms
very
much
afraid
though
they
knew
not
wherefore
ah
said
rosa
with
a
sigh
of
relief
there
is
madame
coming
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
beckoned
to
her
impatiently
her
friend
hastened
her
steps
and
when
she
heard
of
the
strangers
who
were
in
the
house
she
said
you
had
better
go
home
with
me
and
stay
there
till
they
are
gone
what
are
they
going
to
do
inquired
floracita
i
will
tell
you
presently
replied
madame
as
she
led
them
noiselessly
out
of
the
house
by
a
back
way
when
they
entered
her
own
little
parlor
the
parrot
called
out
petit
and
after
waiting
for
the
old
familiar
response
jour
jolie
she
began
to
call
herself
and
to
sing
ha
petit
blanc
mon
bon
the
poor
girls
had
no
heart
for
play
and
madame
considerately
silenced
the
noisy
bird
by
hanging
a
cloth
over
the
cage
my
dear
children
said
she
i
would
gladly
avoid
telling
you
anything
calculated
to
make
you
more
unhappy
but
you
know
the
state
of
things
sooner
or
later
and
it
is
better
that
a
friend
should
tell
you
your
father
owed
money
to
those
men
and
they
are
seeing
what
they
can
find
to
sell
in
order
to
get
their
pay
will
they
sell
the
table
and
boxes
mamita
painted
and
the
ottomans
she
embroidered
inquired
rosa
anxiously
will
they
sell
the
piano
that
papa
gave
to
rosa
for
a
birthday
present
asked
flora
i
am
afraid
they
will
rejoined
madame
the
girls
covered
their
faces
and
groaned
do
be
so
distressed
my
poor
children
said
their
sympathizing
friend
i
have
been
trying
to
save
a
little
something
for
you
see
here
and
she
brought
forth
some
of
the
hidden
portfolios
and
boxes
saying
these
will
be
of
great
use
to
you
my
darlings
in
helping
you
to
earn
your
living
and
they
would
bring
almost
nothing
at
auction
they
thanked
their
careful
friend
for
her
foresight
but
when
she
brought
forward
their
mother
gold
watch
and
diamond
ring
rosa
said
i
would
rather
not
keep
such
expensive
things
dear
friend
you
know
our
dear
father
was
the
soul
of
honor
it
would
have
troubled
him
greatly
not
to
pay
what
he
owed
i
would
rather
have
the
ring
and
the
watch
sold
to
pay
his
debts
i
will
tell
the
creditors
what
you
say
answered
madame
and
they
will
be
brutes
if
they
do
let
you
keep
your
mother
things
your
father
owed
signor
papanti
a
little
bill
and
he
says
he
will
try
to
get
the
table
and
boxes
and
some
other
things
in
payment
and
then
you
shall
have
them
all
you
will
earn
enough
to
buy
another
piano
by
and
by
and
you
can
use
mine
you
know
so
do
be
discouraged
my
poor
children
god
has
been
very
good
to
us
to
raise
us
up
such
friends
as
you
and
the
signor
replied
rosa
you
do
know
how
it
comforts
me
to
have
you
call
us
your
children
for
without
you
we
should
be
all
alone
in
the
world
chapter
such
sudden
reverses
such
overwhelming
sorrows
mature
characters
with
wonderful
rapidity
rosa
though
formed
by
nature
and
habit
to
cling
to
others
soon
began
to
form
plans
for
future
support
her
inexperienced
mind
foresaw
few
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
the
career
her
friends
had
suggested
she
merely
expected
to
study
and
work
hard
but
that
seemed
a
trifle
if
she
could
avoid
for
herself
and
her
sister
the
publicity
which
their
father
had
so
much
dreaded
floracita
too
seemed
like
a
tamed
bird
she
was
sprightly
as
ever
in
her
motions
and
quick
in
her
gestures
but
she
would
sit
patiently
at
her
task
of
embroidery
hour
after
hour
without
even
looking
up
to
answer
the
noisy
challenges
of
the
parrot
sometimes
the
sisters
while
they
worked
sang
together
the
hymns
they
had
been
accustomed
to
sing
with
their
father
on
sundays
and
memory
of
the
missing
voice
imparted
to
their
tones
a
pathos
that
no
mere
skill
could
imitate
one
day
when
they
were
thus
occupied
the
rang
and
they
heard
a
voice
which
they
thought
they
recognized
talking
with
madame
it
was
franz
blumenthal
i
have
come
to
bring
some
small
articles
for
the
young
ladies
said
he
a
week
before
my
best
friend
died
a
frenchwoman
came
to
the
store
and
wished
to
sell
some
she
said
she
was
a
poor
widow
and
royal
who
was
always
kind
and
generous
commissioned
her
to
make
two
of
her
handsomest
baskets
and
embroider
the
names
of
his
daughters
on
them
she
has
placed
them
in
my
hands
and
i
have
brought
them
myself
in
order
to
explain
the
circumstances
are
they
paid
for
inquired
madame
i
have
paid
for
them
replied
the
young
man
blushing
deeply
but
please
not
to
inform
the
young
ladies
of
that
circumstance
and
madame
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
here
are
fifty
dollars
i
want
you
to
use
them
for
the
young
ladies
without
their
knowledge
and
i
should
like
to
remit
to
you
half
my
wages
every
month
for
the
same
purpose
when
royal
was
closing
business
he
wrote
several
letters
of
recommendation
for
me
and
addressed
them
to
merchants
i
feel
quite
sure
of
getting
a
situation
where
i
can
earn
more
than
i
need
for
myself
exclaimed
madame
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
i
will
borrow
the
fifty
dollars
but
i
trust
we
shall
be
able
to
pay
you
before
many
months
it
will
wound
my
feelings
if
you
ever
offer
to
repay
me
replied
the
young
man
my
only
regret
is
that
i
can
not
just
now
do
any
more
for
the
daughters
of
my
best
friend
and
benefactor
who
did
so
much
for
me
when
i
was
a
poor
destitute
boy
but
would
it
be
asking
too
great
a
favor
madame
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
young
ladies
and
place
in
their
hands
these
presents
from
their
father
madame
guirlande
smiled
as
she
thought
to
herself
what
is
he
but
a
boy
now
he
grows
tall
though
when
she
told
her
that
franz
blumenthal
had
a
message
he
wished
to
deliver
to
them
personally
rosa
said
please
go
and
receive
it
sistita
i
had
rather
not
leave
my
work
floracita
glanced
at
the
mirror
smoothed
her
hair
a
little
arranged
her
collar
and
went
out
the
young
clerk
was
awaiting
her
appearance
with
a
good
deal
of
trepidation
he
had
planned
a
very
nice
little
speech
to
make
but
before
he
had
stammered
out
all
the
story
about
the
baskets
he
saw
an
expression
in
flora
face
which
made
him
feel
that
it
was
indelicate
to
intrude
upon
her
emotion
and
he
hurried
away
scarcely
hearing
her
choked
voice
as
she
said
i
thank
you
very
reverently
the
orphans
opened
the
box
which
contained
the
posthumous
gifts
of
their
beloved
father
the
baskets
were
manufactured
with
exquisite
taste
they
were
lined
with
quilled
satin
around
the
outside
of
one
was
the
name
of
rosabella
embroidered
in
flowers
and
an
embroidered
garland
of
roses
formed
the
handle
the
other
bore
the
name
of
floracita
in
minute
flowers
and
the
handle
was
formed
of
they
turned
them
round
slowly
unable
to
distinguish
the
colors
through
their
swimming
tears
how
like
papasito
to
be
so
kind
to
the
poor
woman
and
so
thoughtful
to
please
us
said
rosabella
but
he
was
always
so
and
he
must
have
told
her
what
flowers
to
put
on
the
baskets
said
floracita
you
know
mamita
often
called
me
o
there
never
such
a
papasito
notwithstanding
the
sadness
that
invested
tokens
coming
as
it
were
from
the
dead
they
inspired
a
consoling
consciousness
of
his
presence
and
their
work
seemed
pleasanter
all
the
day
for
having
their
little
baskets
by
them
the
next
morning
witnessed
a
private
conference
between
madame
and
the
signor
if
any
one
had
seen
them
without
hearing
their
conversation
he
would
certainly
have
thought
they
were
rehearsing
some
very
passionate
scene
in
a
tragedy
the
fiery
italian
rushed
up
and
down
the
room
plucking
his
hair
while
the
frenchwoman
ever
and
anon
threw
up
her
hands
exclaiming
dieu
mon
when
the
violence
of
their
emotions
had
somewhat
abated
madame
said
signor
there
must
be
some
mistake
about
this
it
can
not
be
true
royal
would
never
have
left
things
in
such
a
way
at
your
request
replied
the
signor
i
went
to
one
of
the
creditors
to
ask
whether
royal
family
could
not
be
allowed
to
keep
their
mother
watch
and
jewels
he
replied
that
royal
left
no
family
that
his
daughters
were
slaves
and
being
property
themselves
they
could
legally
hold
no
property
i
was
so
sure
my
friend
royal
would
not
have
left
things
in
such
a
state
that
i
told
him
he
lied
and
threatened
to
knock
him
down
he
out
with
his
pistol
but
when
i
told
him
i
had
left
mine
at
home
he
said
i
must
settle
with
him
some
other
time
unless
i
chose
to
make
an
apology
i
told
him
i
would
do
so
whenever
i
was
convinced
that
his
statement
was
true
i
was
never
more
surprised
than
when
he
told
me
that
madame
royal
was
a
slave
i
knew
she
was
a
quadroon
and
i
supposed
she
was
a
as
so
many
of
the
quadroons
are
but
now
it
seems
that
royal
bought
her
of
her
father
and
he
good
easy
man
neglected
to
manumit
her
he
of
course
knew
that
by
law
child
follows
the
condition
of
the
mother
but
i
suppose
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
the
daughters
of
so
rich
a
man
as
he
was
could
ever
be
slaves
at
all
events
he
neglected
to
have
manumission
papers
drawn
till
it
was
too
late
for
his
property
had
become
so
much
involved
that
he
no
longer
had
a
legal
right
to
convey
any
of
it
away
from
creditors
madame
swung
back
and
forth
in
the
vehemence
of
her
agitation
exclaiming
what
to
be
done
what
to
be
done
the
italian
strode
up
and
down
the
room
clenching
his
fist
and
talking
rapidly
to
think
of
that
rosabella
exclaimed
he
a
girl
that
would
grace
any
throne
in
europe
to
think
of
on
the
with
a
crowd
of
rascals
staring
at
her
and
rich
libertines
like
that
bruteman
pah
i
ca
endure
to
think
of
it
how
like
a
satyr
he
looked
while
he
was
talking
to
me
about
their
being
slaves
it
seems
he
got
sight
of
them
when
they
took
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
and
that
handsome
little
witch
floracita
whom
her
father
loved
so
tenderly
to
think
of
her
being
bid
off
to
some
such
filthy
wretch
but
they
have
they
have
i
swear
i
shoot
any
man
that
comes
to
take
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
and
rushed
round
like
a
tiger
in
a
cage
my
friend
replied
madame
they
have
the
law
on
their
side
and
if
you
try
to
resist
you
will
get
yourself
into
trouble
without
doing
the
girls
any
good
i
tell
you
what
we
must
do
we
must
disguise
them
and
send
them
to
the
north
send
them
to
the
north
exclaimed
the
italian
why
they
no
more
know
how
to
get
there
than
a
couple
of
kittens
then
i
must
go
with
them
replied
madame
and
they
must
be
got
out
of
this
house
before
another
day
for
now
that
we
know
of
it
we
shall
be
watched
the
impetuous
italian
shook
her
hand
cordially
you
have
a
brave
heart
madame
said
he
i
should
rather
march
up
to
the
mouth
than
tell
them
such
news
as
this
the
bewildered
frenchwoman
felt
the
same
dread
of
the
task
before
her
but
she
bravely
said
what
be
done
be
done
after
some
further
talk
with
the
signor
concerning
ways
and
means
she
bade
him
good
morning
and
sat
still
for
a
moment
to
collect
her
thoughts
she
then
proceeded
to
the
apartment
assigned
to
the
orphans
they
were
occupied
with
a
piece
of
embroidery
she
had
promised
to
sell
for
them
she
looked
at
the
work
praised
the
exactness
of
the
stitches
and
the
tasteful
shading
of
the
flowers
but
while
she
pointed
out
the
beauties
of
the
pattern
her
hand
and
voice
trembled
rosabella
noticed
it
and
looking
up
said
what
troubles
you
dear
friend
o
this
is
a
world
of
trouble
replied
madame
and
you
have
had
such
a
storm
beating
on
your
young
heads
that
i
wonder
you
keep
your
senses
i
do
know
as
we
could
said
rosa
if
the
good
god
had
not
given
us
such
a
friend
as
you
if
any
trouble
should
come
i
trust
you
will
try
to
keep
up
brave
hearts
my
children
rejoined
madame
i
do
know
of
any
new
trouble
that
come
to
us
now
said
rosa
unless
you
should
be
taken
from
us
as
our
father
was
it
seems
as
if
everything
else
had
happened
that
happen
o
there
are
worse
things
than
having
die
replied
madame
floracita
had
paused
with
her
thread
half
drawn
through
her
work
and
was
looking
earnestly
at
the
troubled
countenance
of
their
friend
madame
exclaimed
she
something
has
happened
what
is
it
i
will
tell
you
said
madame
if
you
will
promise
not
to
scream
or
faint
and
will
try
to
keep
your
wits
collected
so
as
to
help
me
think
what
is
best
to
be
done
they
promised
and
watching
her
countenance
with
an
expression
of
wonder
and
anxiety
they
waited
to
hear
what
she
had
to
communicate
my
dear
children
said
she
i
have
heard
something
that
will
distress
you
very
much
something
neither
you
nor
i
ever
suspected
your
mother
was
a
slave
mother
a
slave
exclaimed
rosa
coloring
vehemently
slave
could
she
be
when
she
was
papasito
wife
and
he
loved
her
so
it
is
impossible
madame
your
father
bought
her
when
she
was
very
young
my
dear
but
i
know
very
well
that
no
wife
was
ever
loved
better
than
she
was
but
she
always
lived
with
her
own
father
till
she
married
papa
said
floracita
how
then
she
be
his
slave
her
father
got
into
trouble
about
money
my
dear
and
he
sold
her
our
grandpapa
gonsalez
sold
his
daughter
exclaimed
rosa
how
incredible
dear
friend
i
wonder
you
can
believe
such
things
the
world
is
full
of
strange
things
my
child
stranger
than
anything
you
ever
read
in
if
she
was
only
papasito
slave
said
flora
i
do
think
mamita
found
any
great
hardship
she
did
not
my
dear
i
do
suppose
she
ever
thought
of
it
but
a
great
misfortune
has
grown
out
of
it
what
is
it
they
both
asked
at
once
their
friend
hesitated
remember
you
have
promised
to
be
calm
said
she
i
presume
you
do
know
that
by
the
laws
of
louisiana
child
follows
the
condition
of
the
mother
the
consequence
is
that
are
slaves
and
your
father
creditors
claim
a
right
to
sell
you
rosabella
turned
very
pale
and
the
hand
with
which
she
clutched
a
chair
trembled
violently
but
she
held
her
head
erect
and
her
look
and
tone
were
very
proud
as
she
exclaimed
become
slaves
i
will
die
rather
floracita
unable
to
comprehend
this
new
misfortune
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
bewildered
way
nature
had
written
mirthfulness
in
the
shape
of
her
beautiful
eyes
which
now
contrasted
strangely
with
their
startled
and
sad
expression
the
frenchwoman
bustled
about
the
room
moving
chairs
and
passing
her
handkerchief
over
boxes
while
she
tried
hard
to
swallow
the
emotions
that
choked
her
utterance
having
conquered
in
the
struggle
she
turned
toward
them
and
said
almost
cheerfully
there
no
need
of
dying
my
children
perhaps
your
old
friend
can
help
you
out
of
this
trouble
we
must
disguise
ourselves
as
gentlemen
and
start
for
the
north
this
very
evening
floracita
looked
at
her
sister
and
said
hesitatingly
could
you
write
to
fitzgerald
and
ask
to
come
here
perhaps
he
could
help
us
rosa
cheeks
glowed
as
she
answered
proudly
do
you
think
i
would
him
to
come
i
would
do
such
a
thing
if
we
were
as
rich
and
happy
as
we
were
a
little
while
ago
and
certainly
i
would
do
it
now
there
spoke
grandpa
gonsalez
said
madame
how
grand
the
old
gentleman
used
to
look
walking
about
so
erect
with
his
cane
but
we
must
go
to
work
in
a
hurry
my
children
signor
papanti
has
promised
to
send
the
disguises
and
we
must
select
and
pack
such
things
as
it
is
absolutely
necessary
we
should
carry
i
am
sorry
now
that
tulee
is
let
out
in
the
city
for
we
need
her
help
she
must
go
with
us
said
flora
i
ca
leave
tulee
we
must
do
as
we
can
replied
madame
in
this
emergency
we
ca
do
as
we
would
are
all
white
and
if
we
can
get
a
few
miles
from
here
we
shall
have
no
further
trouble
but
if
we
had
a
negro
with
us
it
would
lead
to
questions
perhaps
besides
we
have
time
to
disguise
her
and
instruct
her
how
to
perform
her
part
the
signor
will
be
a
good
friend
to
her
and
as
soon
as
we
can
earn
some
money
we
will
send
and
buy
her
but
where
can
we
go
when
we
get
to
the
north
asked
rosa
i
will
tell
you
said
floracita
do
you
remember
that
king
from
boston
who
came
to
see
us
a
year
ago
his
father
was
papa
best
friend
you
know
and
when
he
went
away
he
told
us
if
ever
we
were
in
trouble
to
apply
to
him
as
if
he
were
our
brother
did
he
said
madame
that
lets
in
a
gleam
of
light
i
heard
your
father
say
he
was
a
very
good
young
man
and
rich
but
papasito
said
some
months
ago
that
king
had
gone
to
europe
with
his
mother
on
account
of
her
health
replied
rosa
besides
if
he
were
at
home
it
would
be
very
disagreeable
to
go
to
a
young
gentleman
as
beggars
and
runaways
when
he
was
introduced
to
us
as
ladies
you
must
put
your
pride
in
your
pocket
for
the
present
señorita
gonsalez
said
madame
playfully
touching
her
under
the
chin
if
this
king
is
absent
i
will
write
to
him
they
say
there
is
a
man
in
boston
named
william
lloyd
garrison
who
takes
great
interest
in
slaves
we
will
tell
him
our
story
and
ask
him
about
king
i
did
think
of
stopping
awhile
with
relatives
in
new
york
but
it
would
be
inconvenient
for
them
and
they
might
not
like
it
this
plan
pleases
me
better
to
boston
we
will
go
the
signor
has
gone
to
ask
my
cousin
duroy
to
come
here
and
see
to
the
house
when
i
have
placed
you
safely
i
will
come
back
slyly
to
my
cousin
house
a
few
miles
from
here
and
with
his
help
i
will
settle
up
my
affairs
then
i
will
return
to
you
and
we
will
all
go
to
some
secure
place
and
live
together
i
never
starved
yet
and
i
do
believe
i
ever
shall
the
orphans
clung
to
her
and
kissed
her
hands
as
they
said
how
kind
you
are
to
us
dear
friend
what
shall
we
ever
do
to
repay
you
your
father
and
mother
were
generous
friends
to
me
replied
madame
and
now
their
children
are
in
trouble
i
will
not
forsake
them
as
the
good
lady
was
to
leave
her
apartments
for
an
indefinite
time
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
thought
of
beside
the
necessary
packing
for
the
journey
the
girls
tried
their
best
to
help
her
but
they
were
continually
proposing
to
carry
something
because
it
was
a
keepsake
from
mamita
or
papasito
this
is
no
time
for
sentiment
my
children
said
madame
we
must
not
take
anything
we
can
possibly
do
without
bless
my
soul
there
goes
the
bell
what
if
it
should
be
one
of
those
dreadful
creditors
come
here
to
peep
and
pry
run
to
your
room
my
children
and
bolt
the
door
a
moment
afterward
she
appeared
before
them
smiling
and
said
there
was
no
occasion
for
being
so
frightened
but
i
am
getting
nervous
with
all
this
flurry
come
back
again
dears
it
is
only
franz
blumenthal
what
come
again
asked
rosa
please
go
floracita
and
i
will
come
directly
as
soon
as
i
have
gathered
up
these
things
that
we
must
carry
the
young
german
blushed
like
a
girl
as
he
offered
two
bouquets
one
of
heaths
and
the
other
of
and
fragrant
geraniums
saying
as
he
did
so
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
bring
some
flowers
miss
floracita
my
name
is
miss
royal
sir
she
replied
trying
to
increase
her
stature
to
the
utmost
it
was
an
unusual
caprice
in
one
whose
nature
was
so
childlike
and
playful
but
the
recent
knowledge
that
she
was
a
slave
had
made
her
for
the
first
time
jealous
of
her
dignity
she
took
it
into
her
head
that
he
knew
the
humiliating
fact
and
presumed
upon
it
but
the
good
lad
was
as
yet
unconscious
of
this
new
trouble
and
the
unexpected
rebuke
greatly
surprised
him
though
her
slight
figure
and
juvenile
face
made
her
attempt
at
majesty
somewhat
comic
it
was
quite
sufficient
to
intimidate
the
bashful
youth
and
he
answered
very
meekly
pardon
me
miss
royal
floracita
is
such
a
very
pretty
name
and
i
have
always
liked
it
so
much
that
i
spoke
it
before
i
thought
the
compliment
disarmed
her
at
once
and
with
one
of
her
winning
smiles
and
a
quick
little
courtesy
she
said
do
you
think
it
a
pretty
name
you
call
me
floracita
if
you
like
it
so
much
i
think
it
is
the
prettiest
name
in
the
world
replied
he
i
used
to
like
to
hear
your
mother
say
it
she
said
everything
so
sweetly
do
you
remember
she
used
to
call
me
florimond
when
i
was
a
little
boy
because
she
said
my
face
was
so
florid
now
i
always
write
my
name
franz
florimond
blumenthal
in
memory
of
her
i
will
always
call
you
florimond
just
as
mamita
did
said
she
their
very
juvenile
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
madame
with
rosa
who
thanked
him
graciously
for
her
portion
of
the
flowers
and
told
him
her
father
was
so
much
attached
to
him
that
she
should
always
think
of
him
as
a
brother
he
blushed
crimson
as
he
thanked
her
and
went
away
with
a
very
warm
feeling
at
his
heart
thinking
floracita
a
prettier
name
than
ever
and
happily
unconscious
that
he
was
parting
from
her
he
had
not
been
gone
long
when
the
bell
rang
again
and
the
girls
again
hastened
to
hide
themselves
half
an
hour
elapsed
without
their
seeing
or
hearing
anything
of
madame
and
they
began
to
be
extremely
anxious
lest
something
unpleasant
was
detaining
her
but
she
came
at
last
and
said
my
children
the
signor
wants
to
speak
to
you
they
immediately
descended
to
the
where
they
found
the
signor
looking
down
and
slowly
striking
the
ivory
head
of
his
cane
against
his
chin
as
he
was
wont
to
do
when
buried
in
profound
thought
he
rose
as
they
entered
and
rosa
said
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
what
is
it
you
wish
dear
friend
he
dropped
a
thin
cloak
from
his
shoulders
and
removed
his
hat
which
brought
away
a
grizzled
wig
with
it
and

stood
smiling
before
them
the
glad
surprise
excited
by
this
sudden
realization
of
a
latent
hope
put
maidenly
reserve
to
flight
and
rosa
dropped
on
her
knees
before
him
exclaiming
o
gerald
save
us
he
raised
her
tenderly
and
imprinting
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
said
save
you
my
precious
rose
to
be
sure
i
will
that
what
i
came
for
and
me
too
said
flora
clinging
to
him
and
hiding
her
face
under
his
arm
yes
and
you
too
mischievous
fairy
replied
he
giving
her
a
less
ceremonious
kiss
than
he
had
bestowed
on
her
sister
but
we
must
talk
fast
for
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
done
in
a
short
time
i
was
unfortunately
absent
from
home
and
did
not
receive
the
letter
informing
me
of
your
good
father
death
so
soon
as
i
should
otherwise
have
done
i
arrived
in
the
city
this
morning
but
have
been
too
busy
making
arrangements
for
your
escape
to
come
here
any
earlier
the
signor
and
i
have
done
the
work
of
six
during
the
last
few
hours
the
creditors
are
not
aware
of
my
acquaintance
with
you
and
i
have
assumed
this
disguise
to
prevent
them
from
discovering
it
the
signor
has
had
a
talk
with
tulee
and
told
her
to
keep
very
quiet
and
not
tell
any
mortal
that
she
ever
saw
me
at
your
father
house
a
passage
for
you
and
madame
is
engaged
on
board
a
vessel
bound
to
nassau
which
will
sail
at
midnight
soon
after
i
leave
this
house
cousin
duroy
will
come
with
two
boys
you
and
madame
will
assume
their
dresses
and
they
will
put
on
some
clothes
the
signor
has
already
sent
in
such
boxes
as
madame
is
accustomed
to
receive
full
of
materials
for
her
flowers
all
excepting
ourselves
will
suppose
you
have
gone
north
according
to
the
original
plan
in
order
that
they
may
swear
to
that
effect
if
they
are
brought
to
trial
when
i
go
by
the
front
of
the
house
whistling
you
will
pass
through
the
garden
to
the
street
in
the
rear
where
you
will
find
my
servant
with
a
carriage
which
will
convey
you
three
miles
to
the
house
of
one
of
my
friends
i
will
come
there
in
season
to
accompany
you
on
board
the
ship
o
how
thoughtful
and
how
kind
you
are
exclaimed
rosa
but
we
contrive
some
way
to
take
poor
tulee
with
us
it
would
be
imprudent
he
replied
the
creditors
must
be
allowed
to
sell
her
she
knows
it
but
she
has
my
assurance
that
i
will
take
good
care
of
her
no
harm
shall
come
to
tulee
i
promise
you
i
can
not
go
with
you
to
nassau
because
if
i
do
the
creditors
may
suspect
my
participation
in
the
plot
i
shall
stay
in
new
orleans
a
week
or
ten
days
then
return
to
savannah
and
take
an
early
opportunity
to
sail
for
nassau
by
the
way
of
new
york
meanwhile
i
will
try
to
manage
matters
so
that
madame
can
safely
return
to
her
house
then
we
will
decide
where
to
make
a
happy
home
for
ourselves
the
color
forsook
rosa
cheeks
and
her
whole
frame
quivered
as
she
said
i
thank
you
gerald
for
all
this
thoughtful
care
but
i
can
not
go
to
nassau
indeed
i
can
not
can
not
go
exclaimed
he
where
you
go
then
before
you
came
madame
had
made
ready
to
take
us
to
boston
you
know
we
will
go
there
with
her
rosa
do
you
distrust
me
said
he
reproachfully
do
you
doubt
my
love
i
do
not
distrust
you
she
replied
but
she
looked
down
and
blushed
deeply
as
she
added
but
i
promised
my
father
that
i
would
never
leave
home
with
any
gentleman
unless
i
was
married
to
him
but
rosa
dear
your
father
did
not
foresee
such
a
state
of
things
as
this
everything
is
arranged
and
there
is
no
time
to
lose
if
you
knew
all
that
i
know
you
would
see
the
necessity
of
leaving
this
city
before
i
can
not
go
with
you
she
repeated
in
tones
of
the
deepest
distress
i
go
with
you
for
i
promised
my
dear
father
the
night
before
he
died
he
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
and
then
drawing
her
close
to
him
he
said
it
shall
be
just
as
you
wish
darling
i
will
bring
a
clergyman
to
the
house
of
my
friend
and
we
will
be
married
before
you
sail
rosa
without
venturing
to
look
up
said
in
a
faltering
tone
i
can
not
bear
to
bring
degradation
upon
you
gerald
it
seems
wrong
to
take
advantage
of
your
generous
forgetfulness
of
yourself
when
you
first
told
me
you
loved
me
you
did
not
know
i
was
an
octoroon
and
a
slave
i
knew
your
mother
was
a
quadroon
he
replied
and
as
for
the
rest
no
circumstance
can
degrade
my
rose
royal
but
if
your
plan
should
not
succeed
how
ashamed
you
would
feel
to
have
us
seized
said
she
it
succeed
dearest
but
even
if
it
should
not
you
shall
never
be
the
property
of
any
man
but
myself
she
exclaimed
in
the
proud
gonsalez
tone
striving
to
withdraw
herself
from
his
embrace
he
hastened
to
say
forgive
me
rosabella
i
am
so
intoxicated
with
happiness
that
i
can
not
be
careful
of
my
words
i
merely
meant
to
express
the
joyful
feeling
that
you
would
be
surely
mine
wholly
mine
while
they
were
talking
thus
floracita
had
glided
out
of
the
room
to
carry
the
tidings
to
madame
the
pressure
of
misfortune
had
been
so
heavy
upon
her
that
now
it
was
lifted
a
little
her
elastic
spirit
rebounded
with
a
sudden
spring
and
she
felt
happier
than
she
had
ever
thought
of
being
since
her
father
died
in
the
lightness
of
her
heart
she
began
to
sing
blanc
mon
bon
but
she
stopped
at
the
first
line
for
she
recollected
how
her
father
had
checked
her
in
the
midst
of
that
frisky
little
song
and
now
that
she
knew
they
were
octoroons
she
partly
comprehended
why
it
had
been
disagreeable
to
him
but
the
gayety
that
died
out
of
her
voice
passed
into
her
steps
she
went
hopping
and
jumping
up
to
madame
exclaiming
what
do
you
think
is
going
to
happen
now
rosabella
is
going
to
be
married
right
off
what
a
pity
she
ca
be
dressed
like
a
bride
she
would
look
so
handsome
in
white
satin
and
pearls
and
a
great
lace
veil
but
here
are
the
flowers
florimond
brought
so
opportunely
i
will
put
the
in
her
hair
and
she
shall
have
a
bouquet
in
her
hand
she
will
look
handsome
in
anything
rejoined
madame
but
tell
me
about
it
little
one
after
receiving
flora
answers
to
a
few
brief
questions
she
stationed
herself
within
sight
of
the
outer
door
that
she
might
ask
fitzgerald
for
more
minute
directions
concerning
what
they
were
to
do
he
very
soon
made
his
appearance
again
disguised
as
the
signor
after
a
hurried
consultation
madame
said
i
do
hope
nothing
will
happen
to
prevent
our
getting
off
safely
rosabella
has
so
much
spanish
pride
i
verily
believe
she
would
stab
herself
rather
than
go
on
the
heavens
and
earth
do
speak
of
that
exclaimed
he
impetuously
do
you
suppose
i
would
allow
my
beautiful
rose
to
be
trampled
by
swine
if
we
fail
i
will
buy
them
if
it
costs
half
my
fortune
but
we
shall
fail
do
let
the
girls
go
out
of
the
door
till
you
hear
the
signal
no
danger
of
that
she
replied
their
father
always
kept
them
like
wax
flowers
under
a
glass
cover
they
are
as
timid
as
hares
before
she
finished
the
words
he
was
gone
rosabella
remained
where
he
had
left
her
with
her
head
bowed
on
the
table
floracita
was
nestling
by
her
side
pouring
forth
her
girlish
congratulations
madame
came
in
saying
in
her
cheerly
way
so
you
are
going
to
be
married
to
night
bless
my
soul
how
the
world
whirls
round
is
god
good
to
us
asked
rosa
looking
up
how
noble
and
kind
fitzgerald
is
to
wish
to
marry
me
now
that
everything
is
so
changed
are
not
changed
darling
she
replied
except
that
i
think
you
are
a
little
better
and
that
seemed
unnecessary
but
you
must
be
thinking
my
children
whether
everything
is
in
readiness
he
told
us
we
were
not
to
go
till
evening
and
it
is
dark
yet
said
floracita
could
we
go
into
papasito
garden
one
little
minute
and
take
one
sip
from
the
fountain
and
just
one
little
walk
round
the
it
would
be
safe
my
dear
there
no
telling
who
may
be
lurking
about
fitzgerald
charged
me
not
to
let
you
go
out
of
doors
but
you
can
go
to
my
chamber
and
take
a
last
look
of
the
house
and
garden
they
went
up
stairs
and
stood
with
their
arms
around
each
other
gazing
at
their
once
happy
home
how
many
times
we
have
walked
in
that
little
grove
hand
in
hand
with
mamita
and
papasito
and
now
they
are
both
gone
sighed
rosa
ah
yes
said
flora
and
now
we
are
afraid
to
go
there
for
a
minute
how
strangely
everything
has
changed
we
do
hear
spanish
and
papa
english
any
more
we
have
nobody
to
talk
to
now
it
all
french
with
madame
and
all
italian
with
the
signor
but
what
kind
souls
they
are
to
do
so
much
for
us
responded
rosa
if
such
good
friends
had
been
raised
up
for
us
in
these
dreadful
days
what
we
have
done
here
madame
came
hurrying
in
to
say
duroy
and
the
boys
have
come
we
must
change
dresses
before
the
whistler
goes
by
the
disguises
were
quickly
assumed
and
the
metamorphosis
made
rosa
both
blush
and
smile
while
her
volatile
sister
laughed
outright
but
she
checked
herself
immediately
saying
i
am
a
wicked
little
wretch
to
laugh
for
you
and
your
friends
may
get
into
trouble
by
doing
all
this
for
us
what
shall
you
tell
them
about
us
when
you
get
back
from
nassau
i
do
intend
to
tell
them
much
of
anything
replied
madame
i
may
perhaps
give
them
a
hint
that
one
of
your
father
old
friends
invited
you
to
come
to
the
north
and
that
i
did
not
consider
it
my
business
to
hinder
you
o
fie
madame
said
floracita
what
a
talent
you
have
for
arranging
the
truth
with
variations
madame
tried
to
return
a
small
volley
of
french
pleasantry
but
the
effort
was
obviously
a
forced
one
the
pulses
of
her
heart
were
throbbing
with
anxiety
and
fear
and
they
all
began
to
feel
suspense
increasing
to
agony
when
at
last
the
whistled
tones
of
were
heard
now
do
act
as
if
you
were
afraid
whispered
madame
as
she
put
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
go
out
naturally
remember
i
am
my
cousin
and
you
are
the
boys
they
passed
through
the
garden
into
the
street
feeling
as
if
some
rough
hand
might
at
any
instant
seize
them
but
all
was
still
save
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
distance
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
carriage
the
driver
began
to
bum
carelessly
to
himself
who
goes
there
stranger
quickly
tell
a
friend
good
night
sang
the
disguised
madame
in
the
same
tune
of
challenge
and
reply
the
carriage
door
was
instantly
opened
they
entered
and
the
horses
started
at
a
brisk
pace
at
the
house
where
the
driver
stopped
they
were
received
as
expected
guests
their
disguises
were
quickly
exchanged
for
dresses
from
their
which
had
been
conveyed
out
in
madame
boxes
and
smuggled
into
the
carriage
by
their
invisible
protector
flora
who
was
intent
upon
having
things
seem
a
little
like
a
wedding
made
a
garland
of
for
her
sister
hair
and
threw
over
her
braids
a
white
gauze
scarf
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
at
half
past
ten
and
at
midnight
madame
was
alone
with
in
the
cabin
of
the
ship
victoria
dashing
through
the
dark
waves
under
a
sky
chapter
vi
fitzgerald
lingered
on
the
wharf
till
the
vessel
containing
his
treasure
was
no
longer
visible
then
he
returned
to
the
carriage
and
was
driven
to
his
hotel
notwithstanding
a
day
of
very
unusual
excitement
and
fatigue
when
he
retired
to
rest
he
felt
no
inclination
to
sleep
rosabella
floated
before
him
as
he
had
first
seen
her
a
radiant
vision
of
beauty
surrounded
by
flowers
he
recalled
the
shy
pride
and
maidenly
modesty
with
which
she
had
met
his
ardent
glances
and
impassioned
words
he
thought
of
the
meek
and
saddened
expression
of
her
face
as
he
had
seen
it
in
these
last
hurried
interviews
and
it
seemed
to
him
she
had
never
appeared
so
lovely
he
remembered
with
a
shudder
what
madame
guirlande
had
said
about
the
he
was
familiar
with
such
scenes
for
he
had
seen
women
offered
for
sale
and
had
himself
bid
for
them
in
competition
with
rude
indecent
crowds
it
was
revolting
to
his
soul
to
associate
the
image
of
rosa
with
such
base
surroundings
but
it
seemed
as
if
some
fiend
persisted
in
holding
the
painful
picture
before
him
he
seemed
to
see
her
graceful
figure
gazed
at
by
a
brutal
crowd
while
the
auctioneer
assured
them
that
she
was
warranted
to
be
an
entirely
new
and
perfectly
sound
article
a
moss
rosebud
from
a
private
royal
garden
a
diamond
fit
for
a
king
crown
and
men
whose
upturned
faces
were
like
greedy
satyrs
were
calling
upon
her
to
open
her
ruby
lips
and
show
her
pearls
he
turned
restlessly
on
his
pillow
with
a
muttered
oath
then
he
smiled
as
he
thought
to
himself
that
by
saving
her
from
such
degradation
he
had
acquired
complete
control
of
her
destiny
from
the
first
moment
he
heard
of
her
reverses
he
had
felt
that
her
misfortunes
were
his
triumph
madly
in
love
as
he
had
been
for
more
than
a
year
his
own
pride
and
still
more
the
dreaded
scorn
of
proud
relatives
had
prevented
him
from
offering
marriage
while
the
watchful
guardianship
of
her
father
and
her
dutiful
respect
to
his
wishes
rendered
any
less
honorable
alliance
hopeless
but
now
he
was
her
sole
protector
and
though
he
had
satisfied
her
scruples
by
marriage
he
could
hide
her
away
and
keep
his
own
secret
while
she
in
the
fulness
of
her
grateful
love
would
doubtless
be
satisfied
with
any
arrangement
he
chose
to
make
but
there
still
remained
some
difficulties
in
his
way
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
his
own
luxurious
home
and
exile
himself
in
the
british
west
indies
and
if
he
should
bring
the
girls
to
georgia
he
foresaw
that
disastrous
consequences
might
ensue
if
his
participation
in
their
elopement
should
ever
be
discovered
or
even
suspected
it
would
have
been
far
more
convenient
to
have
bought
them
outright
even
at
a
high
price
thought
he
but
after
the
signor
repeated
to
me
that
disgusting
talk
of
bruteman
there
could
be
no
mistake
that
he
had
eye
fixed
upon
them
and
it
would
have
been
ruinous
to
enter
into
competition
with
such
a
wealthy
as
he
is
he
values
money
no
more
than
when
he
is
in
pursuit
of
such
game
but
though
i
have
removed
them
from
his
grasp
for
the
present
i
can
feel
no
security
if
i
bring
them
back
to
this
country
i
must
obtain
a
legal
ownership
of
them
but
how
shall
i
manage
it
revolving
many
plans
in
his
mind
he
at
last
fell
asleep
his
first
waking
thought
was
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
creditors
at
noon
and
hear
what
they
had
to
say
he
found
ten
or
twelve
persons
present
some
of
gentlemanly
appearance
others
characters
among
them
and
in
singular
contrast
with
their
faces
was
the
ingenuous
countenance
of
florimond
blumenthal
three
hundred
dollars
of
his
salary
were
due
to
him
and
he
hoped
to
secure
some
portion
of
the
debt
for
the
benefit
of
the
orphans
a
few
individuals
who
knew
fitzgerald
said
what
are
you
among
the
creditors
i
am
not
a
creditor
he
replied
but
i
am
here
to
represent
the
claims
of
whitwell
of
savannah
who
being
unable
to
be
present
in
person
requested
me
to
lay
his
accounts
before
you
he
sat
listening
to
the
tedious
details
of
royal
liabilities
and
the
appraisement
of
his
property
with
an
expression
of
listless
indifference
often
moving
his
fingers
to
a
tune
or
making
the
motion
of
whistling
without
the
rudeness
of
emitting
a
sound
young
blumenthal
on
the
contrary
manifested
the
absorbed
attention
of
one
who
loved
his
benefactor
and
was
familiar
with
the
details
of
his
affairs
no
notice
was
taken
of
him
however
for
his
claim
was
small
and
he
was
too
young
to
be
a
power
in
the
commercial
world
he
modestly
refrained
from
making
any
remarks
and
having
given
in
his
account
he
rose
to
take
his
hat
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
hearing
bruteman
say
we
have
not
yet
mentioned
the
most
valuable
property
royal
left
i
allude
to
his
daughters
blumenthal
sank
into
his
chair
again
and
every
vestige
of
color
left
his
usually
blooming
countenance
but
though
fitzgerald
was
on
to
know
whether
the
escape
was
discovered
he
betrayed
no
sign
of
interest
bruteman
went
on
to
say
we
appraised
them
at
six
thousand
dollars
much
less
than
they
would
bring
at
auction
observed
chandler
as
you
would
all
agree
gentlemen
if
you
had
seen
them
for
they
are
fancy
articles
a
no
is
it
certain
the
young
ladies
are
slaves
inquired
blumenthal
with
a
degree
of
agitation
that
attracted
attention
toward
him
it
certain
replied
bruteman
their
mother
was
a
slave
and
was
never
manumitted
could
a
subscription
be
raised
or
an
appeal
be
made
to
some
court
in
their
behalf
asked
the
young
man
with
constrained
calmness
in
his
tones
while
the
expression
of
his
face
betrayed
his
inward
suffering
they
are
elegant
accomplished
young
ladies
and
their
good
father
brought
them
up
with
the
greatest
indulgence
perhaps
you
are
in
love
with
one
or
both
of
them
rejoined
bruteman
if
so
you
must
buy
them
at
auction
if
you
can
the
law
is
inexorable
it
requires
that
all
the
property
of
an
insolvent
debtor
should
be
disposed
of
at
public
sale
i
am
very
slightly
acquainted
with
the
young
ladies
said
the
agitated
youth
but
their
father
was
my
benefactor
when
i
was
a
poor
destitute
orphan
and
i
would
sacrifice
my
life
to
save
orphans
from
such
a
dreadful
calamity
i
know
little
about
the
requirements
of
the
law
gentlemen
but
i
implore
you
to
tell
me
if
there
is
way
to
prevent
this
if
it
can
be
done
by
money
i
will
serve
any
gentleman
gratuitously
any
number
of
years
he
requires
if
he
will
advance
the
necessary
sum
we
are
not
here
to
talk
sentiment
my
lad
rejoined
bruteman
we
are
here
to
transact
business
i
respect
this
youth
for
the
feeling
he
has
manifested
toward
his
benefactor
children
said
a
gentleman
named
ammidon
if
we
enter
into
some
mutual
agreement
to
relinquish
this
portion
of
the
property
i
for
one
should
be
extremely
glad
i
should
be
willing
to
lose
much
more
than
my
share
for
the
sake
of
bringing
about
such
an
arrangement
and
really
the
sale
of
such
girls
as
these
are
said
to
be
is
not
very
creditable
to
the
country
if
any
foreign
travellers
happen
to
be
looking
on
they
will
make
great
capital
out
of
such
a
story
at
all
events
the
abolitionists
will
be
sure
to
get
it
into
their
papers
and
all
europe
will
be
ringing
changes
upon
it
let
ring
fiercely
exclaimed
chandler
i
do
care
a
damn
about
the
abolitionists
nor
europe
neither
i
reckon
we
can
manage
our
own
affairs
in
this
free
country
i
should
judge
by
your
remarks
that
you
were
an
abolitionist
yourself
ammidon
said
bruteman
i
am
surprised
to
hear
a
southerner
speak
as
if
the
opinions
of
rascally
amalgamationists
were
of
the
slightest
consequence
i
consider
such
sentiments
unworthy
any
southern
sir
ammidon
flushed
and
answered
quickly
i
allow
no
man
to
call
in
question
my
being
a
gentleman
sir
if
you
consider
yourself
insulted
you
know
your
remedy
rejoined
bruteman
i
give
you
your
choice
of
place
and
weapons
fitzgerald
consulted
his
watch
and
two
or
three
others
followed
his
example
i
see
said
ammidon
that
gentlemen
are
desirous
to
adjourn
it
is
time
that
we
did
so
rejoined
bruteman
officers
have
been
sent
for
these
slaves
of
royal
and
they
are
probably
now
lodged
in
jail
at
our
next
meeting
we
will
decide
upon
the
time
of
sale
young
blumenthal
rose
and
attempted
to
go
out
but
a
blindness
came
over
him
and
he
staggered
against
the
wall
i
reckon
that
youngster
an
abolitionist
muttered
chandler
at
any
rate
he
seems
to
think
there
a
difference
in
niggers
and
all
such
ought
to
have
notice
to
quit
ammidon
called
for
water
with
which
he
sprinkled
the
young
face
and
two
or
three
others
assisted
to
help
him
into
a
carriage
another
meeting
was
held
the
next
day
which
fitzgerald
did
not
attend
foreseeing
that
it
would
be
a
stormy
one
the
result
of
it
was
shown
in
the
arrest
and
imprisonment
of
signor
papanti
and
a
vigilant
search
for
madame
guirlande
her
cousin
duroy
declared
that
he
had
been
requested
to
take
care
of
her
apartments
for
a
few
weeks
as
she
was
obliged
to
go
to
new
york
on
business
that
she
took
her
young
lady
boarders
with
her
and
that
was
all
he
knew
despatches
were
sent
in
hot
haste
to
the
new
york
and
boston
police
describing
the
fugitives
declaring
them
to
be
thieves
and
demanding
that
they
should
be
sent
forthwith
to
new
orleans
for
trial
the
policeman
who
had
been
employed
to
watch
madame
house
and
who
had
been
induced
to
turn
his
back
for
a
while
by
some
mysterious
process
best
known
to
fitzgerald
was
severely
and
liberally
pelted
with
oaths
in
the
course
of
the
investigations
it
came
out
that
florimond
blumenthal
had
visited
the
house
on
the
day
of
the
elopement
and
that
toward
dusk
he
had
been
seen
lingering
about
the
premises
watching
the
windows
the
story
got
abroad
that
he
had
been
an
accomplice
in
helping
off
two
valuable
slaves
the
consequence
was
that
he
received
a
written
intimation
that
if
he
valued
his
neck
he
had
better
quit
new
orleans
within
hours
signed
judge
lynch
fitzgerald
appeared
to
take
no
share
in
the
excitement
when
he
met
any
of
the
creditors
he
would
sometimes
ask
carelessly
any
news
yet
about
those
slaves
of
royal
he
took
occasion
to
remark
to
two
or
three
of
them
that
signor
papanti
being
an
old
friend
of
his
he
had
been
to
the
prison
to
see
him
that
he
was
convinced
he
had
no
idea
where
those
girls
had
gone
he
was
only
their
and
such
an
impetuous
peppery
man
that
they
never
would
have
thought
of
trusting
him
with
any
important
secret
having
thus
paved
the
way
he
came
out
with
a
distinct
proposition
at
the
next
meeting
i
feel
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
for
signor
papanti
said
he
i
have
been
acquainted
with
him
a
good
while
and
have
taken
lessons
of
him
both
in
music
and
italian
and
i
like
the
old
gentleman
he
is
getting
ill
in
prison
and
he
can
never
tell
you
any
more
than
he
has
told
you
doubtless
he
knew
that
madame
intended
to
convey
those
girls
to
the
north
if
she
possibly
could
but
i
confess
i
should
have
despised
him
if
he
had
turned
informer
against
the
daughters
of
his
friend
who
had
been
his
own
favorite
pupils
if
you
will
gratify
me
by
releasing
him
i
will
make
you
an
offer
for
those
girls
and
take
my
chance
of
ever
finding
them
what
sum
do
you
propose
to
offer
inquired
the
creditors
i
will
pay
one
thousand
dollars
if
you
accede
to
my
terms
say
two
thousand
and
we
will
take
the
subject
under
consideration
they
replied
in
that
case
i
must
increase
my
demands
said
he
i
have
reason
to
suspect
that
my
friend
the
signor
would
like
to
make
a
match
with
madame
guirlande
if
you
will
allow
her
to
come
back
to
her
business
and
remain
undisturbed
and
will
make
me
a
sale
of
these
girls
i
do
care
if
i
do
say
two
thousand
he
has
told
you
where
they
are
exclaimed
bruteman
abruptly
and
let
me
tell
you
if
you
know
where
they
are
you
are
not
acting
the
part
of
a
gentleman
he
has
not
told
me
i
assure
you
nor
has
he
given
me
the
slightest
intimation
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
he
does
not
know
but
i
am
rather
fond
of
gambling
and
this
is
such
a
desperate
throw
that
it
will
be
all
the
more
exciting
i
never
tried
my
luck
at
buying
slaves
running
and
i
have
rather
a
fancy
for
experimenting
in
that
game
of
chance
and
i
confess
my
curiosity
has
been
so
excited
by
the
wonderful
accounts
i
have
heard
of
those
nonpareil
girls
that
i
should
find
the
pursuit
of
them
a
stimulating
occupation
if
i
should
not
succeed
i
should
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
having
done
a
good
turn
to
my
old
italian
friend
they
asked
more
time
to
reflect
upon
it
and
to
hear
from
new
york
and
boston
with
inward
maledictions
on
their
slowness
he
departed
resolving
in
his
own
mind
that
nothing
should
keep
him
much
longer
from
nassau
come
what
would
as
he
went
out
chandler
remarked
it
very
much
like
him
always
ready
to
gamble
in
anything
after
all
i
have
my
suspicion
that
he
got
a
clew
to
the
mystery
somehow
and
that
he
expects
to
find
those
handsome
wenches
said
bruteman
i
give
a
good
deal
to
baffle
him
it
seems
pretty
certain
that
can
not
obtain
any
clew
rejoined
ammidon
and
we
have
already
expended
considerable
in
the
effort
if
he
can
be
induced
to
offer
two
thousand
five
hundred
i
think
we
had
better
accept
it
after
a
week
absence
in
savannah
and
its
vicinity
making
various
arrangements
for
the
reception
of
the
sisters
fitzgerald
returned
to
new
orleans
and
took
an
early
opportunity
to
inform
the
creditors
that
he
should
remain
a
very
short
time
he
made
no
allusion
to
his
proposed
bargain
and
when
they
alluded
to
it
he
affected
great
indifference
i
should
be
willing
to
give
you
five
hundred
dollars
to
release
my
musical
friend
said
he
but
as
for
those
daughters
of
royal
it
seems
to
me
upon
reflection
to
be
rather
a
quixotic
undertaking
to
go
in
pursuit
of
them
you
know
it
a
difficult
job
to
catch
a
slave
after
he
gets
to
the
north
if
he
as
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
and
all
yankeedom
would
be
up
in
arms
at
any
attempt
to
seize
such
white
ladies
of
course
i
could
obtain
them
in
no
other
way
than
by
courting
them
and
gaining
their
goodwill
bruteman
and
chandler
made
some
remarks
unfit
for
repetition
but
which
were
greeted
with
shouts
of
laughter
after
much
dodging
and
doubling
on
the
financial
question
fitzgerald
agreed
to
pay
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
if
all
his
demands
were
complied
with
the
papers
were
drawn
and
signed
with
all
due
formality
he
clasped
them
in
his
and
walked
off
with
an
elastic
step
saying
now
for
nassau
chapter
vii
the
scenery
of
the
south
was
in
the
full
glory
of
june
when
fitzgerald
rosa
and
floracita
were
floating
up
the
savannah
river
in
a
boat
manned
by
negroes
who
ever
and
anon
waked
the
stillness
of
the
woods
with
snatches
of
wild
melody
they
landed
on
a
sequestered
island
which
ocean
and
river
held
in
their
arms
leaving
the
servants
to
take
care
of
the
luggage
they
strolled
along
over
a
carpet
of
through
winding
where
glances
of
bright
water
here
and
there
gleamed
through
the
dark
pines
that
were
singing
their
sleepy
chorus
with
its
lulling
sound
of
the
sea
and
filling
the
air
with
their
aromatic
breath
before
long
they
saw
a
turban
moving
among
the
green
foliage
and
the
sisters
at
once
exclaimed
tulipa
dear
gerald
you
did
tell
us
tulee
was
here
said
rosa
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
pleasant
surprise
he
replied
she
thanked
him
with
a
glance
more
expressive
than
words
tulipa
meanwhile
was
waving
a
white
towel
with
joyful
energy
and
when
she
came
up
to
them
she
half
smothered
them
with
hugs
and
kisses
exclaiming
the
lord
bless
ye
missy
rosy
the
lord
bless
ye
missy
flory
it
does
tulee
eyes
good
to
see
ye
agin
she
eagerly
led
the
way
through
flowering
thickets
to
a
small
lawn
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
pretty
white
cottage
it
was
evident
at
a
glance
that
she
as
well
as
the
master
of
the
establishment
had
done
her
utmost
to
make
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
resemble
their
old
home
as
much
as
possible
rosa
piano
was
there
and
on
it
were
a
number
of
books
which
their
father
had
given
them
as
floracita
pointed
to
the
ottomans
their
mother
had
embroidered
and
the
boxes
and
table
she
had
painted
she
said
our
good
friend
the
signor
sent
those
he
promised
to
buy
them
he
could
not
buy
them
poor
man
answered
fitzgerald
for
he
was
in
prison
at
the
time
of
the
auction
but
he
did
not
forget
to
enjoin
it
upon
me
to
buy
them
a
pleasant
hour
was
spent
in
joyful
surprises
over
pretty
novelties
and
cherished
souvenirs
rosa
was
full
of
quiet
happiness
and
floracita
expressed
her
satisfaction
in
lively
little
gambols
the
sun
was
going
down
when
they
refreshed
themselves
with
the
repast
tulipa
had
provided
unwilling
to
invite
the
merciless
mosquitoes
they
sat
while
the
gloaming
settled
into
darkness
playing
and
singing
melodies
associated
with
other
times
floracita
felt
sorry
when
the
hour
of
separation
for
the
night
came
everything
seemed
so
fearfully
still
except
the
monotonous
wash
of
the
waves
on
the
and
as
far
as
she
could
see
the
landscape
by
the
light
of
a
bright
little
there
was
nothing
but
a
thick
screen
of
trees
and
shrubbery
she
groped
her
way
to
her
expecting
to
find
tulee
there
she
had
been
there
and
had
left
a
little
glimmering
taper
behind
a
screen
which
threw
a
fantastic
shadow
on
the
ceiling
like
a
face
with
a
monstrous
nose
it
affected
the
excitable
child
like
some
kind
of
supernatural
presence
she
crept
to
the
window
and
through
the
veil
of
the
she
dimly
saw
the
same
thick
wall
of
greenery
presently
she
espied
a
long
face
peering
out
from
its
recesses
on
their
voyage
home
from
nassau
gerald
had
sometimes
read
aloud
to
them
from
the
midsummer
night
dream
could
it
be
that
there
were
such
creatures
in
the
woods
as
shakespeare
described
a
closet
adjoining
her
room
had
been
assigned
to

she
opened
the
door
and
said
tulee
are

why

you
come
there
was
no
answer
again
she
gave
a
timid
look
at
the
window
the
long
face
moved
and
a
most
unearthly
sound
was
heard
thoroughly
frightened
she
ran
out
calling
tulee

in
the
darkness
she
ran
against
her
faithful
attendant
and
the
sudden
contact
terrified
her
still
more

all

like
the
rest
of

answered
tulee
laughing
she
assisted
her
darling
to
undress
arranged
her
pillows
and
kissed
her
cheek
just
as
she
had
kissed
it
ever
since
the
rosy
little
mouth
had
learned
to
speak
her
name
then
she
sat
by
the
bedside
talking
over
things
that
had
happened
since
they
parted
so
you
were
put
up
at
auction
and
sold
exclaimed
flora
poor
tulee
how
dreadfully
i
should
have
felt
to
see
you
there
but
gerald
bought
you
and
i
suppose
you
like
to
belong
to
ise
nothin
to
complain
of
massa
gerald
she
answered
but
i
like
better
to
belong
to
myself
so
you
like
to
be
free
would
you
asked
flora
to
be
sure
i
would
said
tulee
yo
like
it
yerself
do
ye
little
missy
then
suddenly
recollecting
what
a
narrow
escape
her
young
lady
had
had
from
the
she
hastened
with
intuitive
delicacy
to
change
the
subject
but
the
same
thought
had
occurred
to
flora
and
she
fell
asleep
thinking
how
tulee
wishes
could
be
gratified
when
morning
floated
upward
out
of
the
arms
of
night
in
robe
of
brightest
saffron
the
aspect
of
everything
was
changed
floracita
sprang
out
of
bed
early
eager
to
explore
the
surroundings
of
their
new
abode
the
little
lawn
looked
very
beautiful
sprinkled
all
over
with
a
variety
of
in
whose
small
cups
dewdrops
glistened
prismatic
as
opals
the
shrubbery
was
no
longer
a
dismal
mass
of
darkness
but
showed
all
manner
of
shadings
of
glossy
green
leaves
which
the
moisture
of
the
night
had
ornamented
with
shimmering
edges
of
crystal
beads
she
found
the
phantom
of
the
night
before
browsing
among
flowers
behind
the
cottage
and
very
kindly
disposed
to
make
her
acquaintance
as
he
had
a
thistle
blossom
sticking
out
of
his
mouth
she
forthwith
named
him
thistle
she
soon
returned
to
the
house
with
her
apron
full
of
vines
and
blossoms
and
prettily
tinted
leaves
see
tulee
said
she
what
a
many
flowers
i
going
to
make
haste
and
dress
the
table
before
gerald
and
rosa
come
to
breakfast
they
took
graceful
shape
under
her
nimble
fingers
and
feeling
happy
in
her
work
she
began
to
hum
how
brightly
breaks
the
morning
whisper
low
sang
gerald
stealing
up
behind
her
and
making
her
start
by
singing
into
her
very
ear
while
rosa
exclaimed
what
a
you
have
made
here
with
all
these
flowers
the
day
passed
pleasantly
enough
with
some
ambling
along
the
on
thistle
back
some
reading
and
sleeping
and
a
good
deal
of
music
the
next
day
black
tom
came
with
a
barouche
and
they
took
a
drive
round
the
lovely
island
the
were
all
abloom
on
gerald
plantation
and
his
stuccoed
villa
with
spacious
veranda
and
high
porch
gleamed
out
in
whiteness
among
a
magnificent
growth
of
trees
and
a
garden
gorgeous
with
efflorescence
the
only
drawback
to
the
pleasure
was
that
gerald
charged
them
to
wear
thick
veils
and
never
to
raise
them
when
any
person
was
in
sight
they
made
no
complaint
because
he
told
them
that
he
should
be
deeply
involved
in
trouble
if
his
participation
in
their
escape
should
be
discovered
but
happy
as
rosa
was
in
reciprocated
love
this
necessity
of
concealment
was
a
skeleton
ever
sitting
at
her
feast
and
floracita
who
had
no
romantic
compensation
for
it
chafed
under
the
restraint
it
was
dusk
when
they
returned
to
the
cottage
and
the
thickets
were
alive
with
as
if
queen
mab
and
all
her
train
were
out
dancing
in
spangles
a
few
days
after
was
rosa
birthday
and
floracita
busied
herself
in
adorning
the
rooms
with
flowery
festoons
after
breakfast
gerald
placed
a
small
parcel
in
the
hand
of
each
of
the
sisters
contained
her
mother
diamond
ring
and
flora
was
her
mother
gold
watch
in
the
back
of
which
was
set
a
small
of
her
father
their
gratitude
took
the
form
of
tears
and
the
young
man
who
had
more
taste
for
gayety
than
sentiment
sought
to
dispel
it
by
lively
music
when
he
saw
the
smiles
coming
again
he
bowed
playfully
and
said
this
day
is
yours
dear
rosa
whatsoever
you
wish
for
you
shall
have
if
it
is
attainable
i
do
wish
for
one
thing
she
replied
promptly
floracita
has
found
out
that
tulee
would
like
to
be
free
i
want
you
to
gratify
her
wish
tulee
is
yours
rejoined
he
i
bought
her
to
attend
upon
you
she
will
attend
upon
me
all
the
same
after
she
is
free
responded
rosa
and
we
should
all
be
happier
i
will
do
it
he
replied
but
i
hope
you
wo
propose
to
make
free
for
i
am
happier
to
be
your
slave
the
papers
were
brought
a
few
days
after
and
tulee
felt
a
great
deal
richer
though
there
was
no
outward
change
in
her
condition
as
the
heat
increased
mosquitoes
in
the
woods
and
on
the
beach
rendered
the
shelter
of
the
house
desirable
most
of
the
time
but
though
fitzgerald
had
usually
spent
the
summer
months
in
travelling
he
seemed
perfectly
contented
to
sing
and
doze
and
trifle
away
his
time
by
rosa
side
week
after
week
floracita
did
not
find
it
entertaining
to
be
a
third
person
with
a
couple
of
lovers
she
had
been
used
to
being
a
person
of
consequence
in
her
little
world
and
though
they
were
very
kind
to
her
they
often
forgot
that
she
was
present
and
never
seemed
to
miss
her
when
she
was
away
she
had
led
a
very
secluded
life
from
her
earliest
childhood
but
she
had
never
before
been
so
entirely
out
of
sight
of
houses
and
people
during
the
few
weeks
she
had
passed
in
nassau
she
had
learned
to
do
with
a
class
of
young
girls
and
it
being
the
first
time
she
had
enjoyed
such
companionship
she
found
it
peculiarly
agreeable
she
longed
to
hear
their
small
talk
again
she
longed
to
have
rosa
to
herself
as
in
the
old
times
she
longed
for
her
father
caresses
for
madame
guirlande
brave
cheerfulness
for
the
signor
peppery
outbursts
which
she
found
very
amusing
and
sometimes
she
thought
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
hear
florimond
say
that
her
name
was
the
prettiest
in
the
world
she
often
took
out
a
pressed
geranium
blossom
under
which
was
written
souvenir
de
florimond
and
she
thought
name
was
very
pretty
too
she
sang
moore
melodies
a
great
deal
and
when
she
warbled
sweet
vale
of
avoca
how
calm
could
i
rest
in
thy
bosom
of
shade
with
the
friend
i
love
best
she
sighed
and
thought
to
herself
ah
if
i
only
a
friend
to
love
best
she
almost
learned
lalla
rookh
by
heart
and
she
pictured
herself
as
the
persian
princess
listening
to
a
minstrel
in
oriental
costume
but
with
a
very
german
face
it
was
not
that
the
child
was
in
love
but
her
heart
was
untenanted
and
as
memories
walked
through
it
it
sounded
empty
tulee
who
was
very
observing
where
her
affections
were
concerned
suspected
that
she
was
comparing
her
own
situation
with
that
of
rosa
one
day
when
she
found
her
in
dreamy
revery
she
patted
her
silky
curls
and
said
does
she
feel
as
if
she
was
laid
by
like
a
fifth
wheel
to
a
coach
never
mind
my
little
one
will
have
a
husband
herself
one
of
these
days
without
looking
up
she
answered
very
pensively
do
you
think
i
ever
shall
tulee
i
do
see
how
i
can
for
i
never
see
anybody
tulipa
took
the
little
head
between
her
black
hands
and
raising
the
pretty
face
toward
her
replied
yes
sure
little
missy
do
ye
ye
had
them
handsome
eyes
for
nothin
but
to
look
at
the
moon
but
come
now
with
me
and
feed
thistle
i
going
to
give
him
a
pailful
of
water
thistle
knows
us
as
well
as
if
he
was
a
christian
jack
thistle
was
a
great
resource
for
tulee
in
her
isolation
and
scarcely
less
so
for
flora
she
often
fed
him
from
her
hand
decorated
him
with
garlands
talked
to
him
and
ambled
about
with
him
in
the
woods
and
on
the
the
visits
of
black
tom
also
introduced
a
little
variety
into
their
life
he
went
back
and
forth
from
savannah
to
procure
such
articles
as
were
needed
at
the
cottage
and
he
always
had
a
budget
of
gossip
for
tulee
tom
chloe
was
an
expert
ironer
and
as
fitzgerald
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
performances
of
that
kind
baskets
of
clothes
were
often
sent
to
chloe
who
was
ingenious
in
finding
excuses
for
bringing
them
back
herself
she
was
a
great
singer
of
methodist
hymns
and
negro
songs
and
had
wonderful
religious
experiences
to
tell
to
listen
to
her
and
tom
was
the
greatest
treat
tulee
had
but
as
she
particularly
prided
herself
on
speaking
like
white
people
she
often
remarked
that
she
could
understand
half
their
lingo
floracita
soon
learned
it
to
perfection
and
excited
many
a
laugh
by
her
imitations
tulee
once
obtained
rosa
permission
to
ride
back
with
tom
and
spend
a
couple
of
hours
at
his
cabin
near
the
grat
hus
as
he
called
his
master
villa
but
when
fitzgerald
heard
of
it
he
interdicted
such
visits
in
the
future
he
wished
to
have
as
little
communication
as
possible
between
the
plantation
and
the
lonely
cottage
and
if
he
had
overheard
some
of
the
confidences
between
chloe
and
tulee
he
probably
would
have
been
confirmed
in
the
wisdom
of
such
a
prohibition
but
tom
was
a
factotum
that
could
not
be
dispensed
with
they
relied
upon
him
for
provisions
letters
and
newspapers
three
or
four
weeks
after
their
arrival
he
brought
a
box
containing
a
long
letter
from
madame
guirlande
and
the
various
articles
she
had
saved
for
the
orphans
from
the
wreck
of
their
early
home
not
long
afterward
another
letter
came
announcing
the
marriage
of
madame
and
the
signor
answering
these
letters
and
preparing
bridal
presents
for
their
old
friends
gave
them
busy
days
gerald
sometimes
ordered
new
music
and
new
novels
from
new
york
and
their
arrival
caused
great
excitement
floracita
natural
taste
for
drawing
had
been
cultivated
by
private
lessons
from
a
french
lady
and
she
now
used
the
pretty
accomplishment
to
make
likenesses
of
thistle
with
and
without
garlands
of
tulee
in
her
bright
turban
and
of
madame
parrot
inscribed
jour
jolie
one
day
rosa
said
as
soon
as
the
heat
abates
so
that
we
can
use
our
needles
without
rusting
we
will
do
a
good
deal
of
embroidery
and
give
it
to
madame
she
sells
such
articles
you
know
and
we
can
make
beautiful
things
of
those
flosses
and
chenilles
the
good
soul
saved
for
us
i
like
that
idea
replied
flora
i
been
wanting
to
do
something
to
show
our
gratitude
there
was
wisdom
as
well
as
kindness
in
the
plan
though
they
never
thought
of
the
wisdom
hours
were
whiled
away
by
the
occupation
which
not
only
kept
their
needles
from
rusting
but
also
their
affections
and
artistic
faculties
as
the
tide
of
time
flowed
on
varied
only
by
these
little
eddies
and
ripples
gerald
though
always
very
loving
with
rosa
became
somewhat
less
exclusive
his
attentions
were
more
equally
divided
between
the
sisters
he
often
occupied
himself
with
floracita
work
and
would
pick
out
the
shades
of
silk
for
her
as
well
as
for
rosa
he
more
frequently
called
upon
her
to
sing
a
solo
as
well
as
to
join
in
duets
and
trios
when
the
weather
became
cooler
it
was
a
favorite
recreation
with
him
to
lounge
at
his
ease
while
rosa
played
and
floracita
fairy
figure
floated
through
the
evolutions
of
some
graceful
dance
sometimes
he
would
laugh
and
say
am
i
not
a
lucky
dog
i
do
envy
the
grand
bashaw
his
circassian
beauties
he
give
his
biggest
diamond
for
such
a
dancer
as
floracita
and
what
is
his
flower
of
the
world
compared
to
my
rosamunda
floracita
whose
warm
heart
always
met
affection
as
swiftly
as
one
drop
of
quicksilver
runs
to
another
became
almost
as
much
attached
to
him
as
she
was
to
rosa
how
kind
gerald
is
to
me
she
would
say
to
tulee
papa
used
to
wish
we
had
a
brother
but
i
did
care
for
one
then
because
he
was
just
as
good
for
a
playmate
but
now
it
pleasant
to
have
a
brother
to
rosa
also
it
was
gratifying
to
have
his
love
for
her
overflow
upon
what
was
dearest
to
her
and
she
would
give
him
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
when
he
called
her
sister
mignonne
or
querida
to
both
of
them
the
lonely
island
came
to
seem
like
a
happy
home
floracita
was
not
so
wildly
frolicsome
as
she
was
before
those
stunning
blows
fell
upon
her
young
life
but
the
natural
buoyancy
of
her
spirits
began
to
return
she
was
always
amusing
them
with
quips
and
cranks
if
she
was
out
of
doors
her
return
to
the
house
would
be
signalized
by
imitations
of
all
sorts
of
birds
or
musical
instruments
and
often
when
gerald
invited
her
to
trip
it
on
the
light
fantastic
toe
she
would
entertain
him
with
one
of
the
negroes
clumsy
shuffling
dances
her
sentimental
songs
fell
into
disuse
and
were
replaced
by
livelier
tunes
instead
of
longing
to
rest
in
the
sweet
vale
of
avoca
she
was
heard
musically
chasing
figaro
here
figaro
there
figaro
everywhere
seven
months
passed
without
other
material
changes
than
the
changing
seasons
when
the
flowers
faded
and
the
leafless
were
hung
with
their
pretty
pendulous
gerald
began
to
make
longer
visits
to
savannah
he
was
however
rarely
gone
more
than
a
week
and
though
rosa
songs
grew
plaintive
in
his
absence
her
spirits
rose
at
once
when
he
came
to
tell
how
homesick
he
had
been
as
for
floracita
she
felt
compensated
for
the
increased
stillness
by
the
privilege
of
having
rosa
all
to
herself
one
day
in
january
when
he
had
been
gone
from
home
several
days
she
invited
rosa
to
a
walk
and
finding
her
desirous
to
finish
a
letter
to
madame
guirlande
she
threw
on
her
straw
hat
and
went
out
half
dancing
as
she
was
wont
to
do
the
fresh
air
was
exhilarating
the
birds
were
singing
and
the
woods
were
already
beautified
with
every
shade
of
glossy
green
enlivened
by
vivid
buds
and
leaflets
of
reddish
brown
she
gathered
here
and
there
a
pretty
sprig
sometimes
placing
them
in
her
hair
sometimes
in
her
little
black
silk
apron
coquettishly
decorated
with
ribbons
she
stopped
before
a
luxuriant
wild
myrtle
pulling
at
the
branches
while
she
sang
when
the
little
hollow
drum
beats
to
bed
when
the
little
fifer
hangs
his
head
when
is
mute
the
moorish
flute
her
song
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
clasp
round
the
waist
and
a
warm
kiss
on
the
lips
o
gerald
you
come
back
she
exclaimed
how
glad
rosa
will
be
and
nobody
else
will
be
glad
i
suppose
rejoined
he
wo
you
give
me
back
my
kiss
when
i
been
gone
a
whole
week
certainly
bon
she
replied
and
as
he
inclined
his
face
toward
her
she
imprinted
a
slight
kiss
on
his
cheek
that
not
giving
me
back
kiss
said
he
i
kissed
your
mouth
and
you
must
kiss
mine
i
will
if
you
wish
it
she
replied
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
but
you
need
hold
me
so
tight
she
added
as
she
tried
to
extricate
herself
finding
he
did
not
release
her
she
looked
up
wonderingly
in
his
face
then
lowered
her
eyes
blushing
crimson
no
one
had
ever
looked
at
her
so
before
come
do
be
coy
said
he
she
slipped
from
him
with
sudden
agility
and
said
somewhat
sharply
gerald
i
do
want
to
be
always
called
and
i
do
want
to
be
treated
as
if
i
were
a
child
i
am
no
longer
a
child
i
am
fifteen
i
am
a
young
lady
so
you
are
and
a
very
charming
one
rejoined
he
giving
her
a
playful
tap
on
the
cheek
as
he
spoke
i
am
going
to
tell
rosa
you
have
come
said
she
and
she
started
on
the
run
when
they
were
all
together
in
the
cottage
she
tried
not
to
seem
constrained
but
she
succeeded
so
ill
that
rosa
would
have
noticed
it
if
she
had
not
been
so
absorbed
in
her
own
happiness
gerald
was
all
affection
to
her
and
full
of
playful
raillery
with
flora
which
however
failed
to
animate
her
as
usual
from
that
time
a
change
came
over
the
little
maiden
and
increased
as
the
days
passed
on
she
spent
much
of
her
time
in
her
own
room
and
when
rosa
inquired
why
she
deserted
them
so
she
excused
herself
by
saying
she
wanted
to
do
a
great
deal
of
for
madame
guirlande
and
that
she
needed
so
many
boxes
they
would
be
in
the
way
in
the
her
passion
for
that
work
grew
wonderfully
and
might
be
accounted
for
by
the
fascination
of
perfect
success
for
her
coronets
and
garlands
and
bouquets
and
baskets
were
arranged
with
so
much
lightness
and
elegance
and
the
shells
were
so
tastefully
combined
that
they
looked
less
like
manufactured
articles
than
like
flowers
that
grew
in
the
gardens
of
the
nereids
tulee
wondered
why
her
vivacious
little
pet
had
all
of
a
sudden
become
so
sedentary
in
her
habits
why
she
never
took
her
customary
rambles
except
when
fitzgerald
was
gone
and
even
then
never
without
her
sister
the
conjecture
she
formed
was
not
very
far
amiss
for
gossip
had
made
her
better
acquainted
with
the
character
of
her
master
than
were
the
other
inmates
of
the
cottage
but
the
extraordinary
industry
was
a
mystery
to
her
one
evening
when
she
found
floracita
alone
in
her
room
at
dusk
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
and
gazing
out
of
the
window
dreamily
she
put
her
hand
on
the
silky
head
and
said
is
my
little
one
homesick
i
have
no
home
to
be
sick
for
she
replied
sadly
is
she
lovesick
then
i
have
no
lover
she
replied
in
the
same
desponding
tone
what
is
it
then
my
pet
tell
tulee
i
wish
i
could
go
to
madame
guirlande
responded
flora
she
was
so
kind
to
us
in
our
first
troubles
it
would
do
you
good
to
make
her
a
visit
said
tulee
and
i
should
think
you
might
manage
to
do
it
somehow
no
gerald
said
a
good
while
ago
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
us
ever
to
go
to
new
orleans
does
he
expect
to
keep
you
here
always
asked
tulee
he
might
just
as
well
keep
you
in
a
prison
little
bird
o
what
the
use
of
talking
tulee
exclaimed
she
impatiently
i
have
no
friends
to
go
to
and
i
stay
here
but
reproaching
herself
for
rejecting
the
sympathy
so
tenderly
offered
she
rose
and
kissed
the
black
cheek
as
she
added
good
tulee
kind
tulee
i
a
little
homesick
but
i
shall
feel
better
in
the
morning
the
next
afternoon
gerald
and
rosa
invited
her
to
join
them
in
a
drive
round
the
island
she
declined
saying
the
box
that
was
soon
to
be
sent
to
madame
was
not
quite
full
and
she
wanted
to
finish
some
more
articles
to
put
in
it
but
she
felt
a
longing
for
the
fresh
air
and
the
intense
blue
glory
of
the
sky
made
the
house
seem
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
she
took
down
her
straw
hat
and
passed
out
swinging
it
by
the
strings
she
stopped
on
the
lawn
to
gather
some
buds
from
a
pyrus
japonica
and
fastening
them
in
the
ribbons
as
she
went
she
walked
toward
her
old
familiar
haunts
in
the
woods
it
was
early
in
february
but
the
warm
sunshine
brought
out
a
delicious
aroma
from
the
firs
and
golden
garlands
of
the
wild
jasmine
fragrant
as
heliotrope
were
winding
round
the
evergreen
thickets
and
swinging
in
flowery
festoons
from
the
trees
melancholy
as
she
felt
when
she
started
from
the
cottage
her
elastic
nature
was
incapable
of
resisting
the
glory
of
the
sky
the
beauty
of
the
earth
the
music
of
the
birds
and
the
invigorating
breath
of
the
ocean
intensified
as
they
all
were
by
a
joyful
sense
of
security
and
freedom
growing
out
of
the
constraint
that
had
lately
been
put
upon
her
movements
she
tripped
along
faster
carolling
as
she
went
an
song
that
her
father
used
to
be
often
humming
begone
dull
care
i
prithee
begone
from
me
begone
dull
care
thou
and
i
shall
never
agree
the
walk
changed
to
hopping
and
dancing
as
she
warbled
various
snatches
from
ballets
and
operas
settling
at
last
upon
the
quaint
little
melody
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
king
and
running
it
through
successive
variations
a
very
gentle
and
refined
voice
from
behind
a
clump
of
evergreens
said
is
this
cinderella
coming
from
the
ball
she
looked
up
with
quick
surprise
and
recognized
a
lady
she
had
several
times
seen
in
nassau
and
it
is
really
you
señorita
gonsalez
said
the
lady
i
thought
i
knew
your
voice
but
i
little
dreamed
of
meeting
you
here
i
have
thought
of
you
many
times
since
i
parted
from
you
at
madame
conquilla
store
of
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
again
and
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
delano
replied
flora
and
i
am
very
much
pleased
that
you
remember
me
how
could
i
help
remembering
you
asked
the
lady
you
were
a
favorite
with
me
from
the
first
time
i
saw
you
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
renew
our
acquaintance
where
do
you
live
my
dear
covered
with
crimson
confusion
flora
stammered
out
i
do
live
anywhere
i
only
staying
here
perhaps
i
shall
meet
you
again
in
the
woods
or
on
the
beach
i
hope
i
shall
excuse
me
said
the
lady
i
have
no
wish
to
intrude
upon
your
privacy
but
if
you
would
like
to
call
upon
me
at
plantation
where
i
shall
be
for
three
or
four
weeks
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
receive
you
thank
you
replied
flora
still
struggling
with
embarrassment
i
should
like
to
come
very
much
but
i
do
have
a
great
deal
of
time
for
visiting
it
not
common
to
have
such
a
pressure
of
cares
and
duties
at
your
age
responded
the
lady
smiling
my
carriage
is
waiting
on
the
beach
trusting
you
will
find
a
few
minutes
to
spare
for
me
i
will
not
say
adieu
but
as
she
turned
away
she
thought
to
herself
what
a
fascinating
child
what
a
charmingly
unsophisticated
way
she
took
to
tell
me
she
would
rather
not
have
me
call
on
her
i
observed
there
seemed
to
be
some
mystery
about
her
when
she
was
in
nassau
what
can
it
be
nothing
wrong
i
hope
floracita
descended
to
the
beach
and
gazed
after
the
carriage
as
long
as
she
could
see
it
her
thoughts
were
so
occupied
with
this
unexpected
interview
that
she
took
no
notice
of
the
golden
drops
which
the
declining
sun
was
showering
on
an
endless
procession
of
waves
nor
did
she
cast
one
of
her
customary
loving
glances
at
the
western
sky
where
masses
of
violet
clouds
with
edges
of
resplendent
gold
enclosed
lakes
of
translucent
beryl
in
which
little
islands
were
floating
she
retraced
her
steps
to
the
woods
almost
crying
how
strange
my
answers
must
appear
to
her
murmured
she
how
i
do
wish
i
could
go
about
openly
like
other
people
i
am
so
tired
of
all
this
concealment
she
neither
jumped
nor
danced
nor
sung
on
her
way
homeward
she
seemed
to
be
revolving
something
in
her
mind
very
busily
after
tea
as
she
and
rosa
were
sitting
alone
in
the
twilight
her
sister
observing
that
she
was
unusually
silent
said
what
are
you
thinking
of
mignonne
i
am
thinking
of
the
time
we
passed
in
nassau
replied
she
and
of
that
yankee
lady
who
seemed
to
take
such
a
fancy
to
me
when
she
came
to
madame
conquilla
to
look
at
the
i
remember
your
talking
about
her
rejoined
rosa
you
thought
her
beautiful
yes
said
floracita
and
it
was
a
peculiar
sort
of
beauty
she
was
the
least
like
you
or
mamita
everything
about
her
was
violet
her
large
gray
eyes
sometimes
had
a
violet
light
in
them
her
hair
was
not
exactly
flaxen
it
looked
like
ashes
of
violets
she
always
wore
fragrant
violets
her
ribbons
and
dresses
were
of
some
shade
of
violet
and
her
breastpin
was
an
amethyst
set
with
pearls
something
in
her
ways
too
made
me
think
of
a
violet
i
think
she
knew
it
and
that
was
the
reason
she
always
wore
that
color
how
delicate
she
was
she
must
have
been
very
beautiful
when
she
was
young
you
used
to
call
her
the
java
sparrow
said
rosa
yes
she
made
me
think
of
my
little
java
sparrow
with
pale
feathers
and
little
gleams
of
violet
on
the
neck
responded
flora
that
lady
seems
to
have
made
a
great
impression
on
your
imagination
said
rosa
and
floracita
explained
that
it
was
because
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
her
she
did
not
mention
that
she
had
seen
that
lady
on
the
island
the
child
was
learning
to
be
reticent
a
few
minutes
afterward
rosa
exclaimed
there
gerald
coming
her
sister
watched
her
as
she
ran
out
to
meet
him
and
sighed
poor
rosa
chapter
viii
a
week
later
when
gerald
had
gone
to
savannah
and
rosa
was
taking
her
daily
siesta
floracita
filled
thistle
panniers
with
several
little
pasteboard
boxes
and
without
saying
anything
to
tulee
mounted
and
rode
off
in
a
direction
she
had
never
taken
except
in
the
barouche
she
was
in
search
of
the
welby
plantation
delano
who
was
busy
with
her
near
the
open
window
was
surprised
to
see
a
light
little
figure
seated
on
a
donkey
riding
up
the
avenue
as
soon
as
floracita
dismounted
she
recognized
her
and
descended
the
steps
of
the
piazza
to
welcome
her
so
you
have
found
the
welby
plantation
said
she
i
thought
you
would
have
much
difficulty
for
there
are
only
two
plantations
on
the
island
this
and
fitzgerald
i
do
know
that
there
are
any
other
except
the
huts
of
the
negroes
she
spoke
the
last
rather
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
but
flora
merely
answered
that
she
had
once
passed
the
welby
plantation
in
a
barouche
as
the
lady
led
the
way
into
the
parlor
she
said
what
is
that
you
have
in
your
hand
my
dear
you
used
to
admire
madame
conquilla
replied
flora
and
i
have
brought
you
some
of
mine
to
see
whether
you
think
i
succeed
tolerably
in
my
imitations
as
she
spoke
she
took
out
a
small
basket
and
poised
it
on
her
finger
why
that
is
perfectly
beautiful
said
delano
i
do
know
how
you
could
contrive
to
give
it
such
an
air
of
lightness
and
grace
i
used
to
think
heavy
and
rather
vulgar
till
i
saw
those
beautiful
productions
at
nassau
but
you
excel
your
teacher
my
dear
miss
gonsalez
i
should
think
the
made
this
four
or
five
other
articles
were
brought
forth
from
the
boxes
and
examined
with
similar
commendation
then
they
fell
into
a
pleasant
chat
about
their
reminiscences
of
nassau
and
diverged
from
that
to
speak
of
the
loveliness
of
their
lonely
little
island
and
the
increasing
beauty
of
the
season
after
a
while
flora
looked
at
her
watch
and
said
i
must
not
stay
long
for
i
did
tell
anybody
i
was
going
away
delano
who
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
medallion
inserted
in
the
back
said
that
is
a
peculiar
little
watch
have
you
the
hair
of
some
friend
set
in
it
no
replied
flora
it
is
the
likeness
of
my
father
she
slipped
the
slight
chain
from
her
neck
and
placed
the
watch
in
the
hand
her
face
flushed
as
she
looked
at
it
but
the
habitual
paleness
soon
returned
you
were
introduced
to
me
as
a
spanish
young
lady
said
she
but
this
face
is
not
spanish
what
was
your
father
name
alfred
royal
of
new
orleans
answered
flora
but
name
is
gonsalez
said
she
flora
blushed
crimson
with
the
consciousness
of
having
betrayed
the
incognito
assumed
at
nassau
gonsalez
was
my
mother
name
she
replied
gazing
on
the
floor
while
she
spoke
delano
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
then
drawing
her
gently
toward
her
she
pressed
her
to
her
side
and
said
with
a
sigh
ah
flora
i
wish
you
were
my
daughter
o
how
i
wish
i
was
exclaimed
the
young
girl
looking
up
with
a
sudden
glow
but
a
shadow
immediately
clouded
her
expressive
face
as
she
added
but
you
would
want
me
for
a
daughter
if
you
knew
everything
about
me
the
lady
was
obviously
troubled
you
seem
to
be
surrounded
by
mysteries
my
little
friend
responded
she
i
will
not
ask
you
for
any
confidence
you
are
unwilling
to
bestow
but
i
am
a
good
deal
older
than
you
and
i
know
the
world
better
than
you
do
if
anything
troubles
you
or
if
you
are
doing
anything
wrong
perhaps
if
you
were
to
tell
me
i
could
help
you
out
of
it
o
no
i
not
doing
anything
wrong
replied
floracita
eagerly
i
never
did
anything
wrong
in
my
life
seeing
a
slight
smile
hovering
about
the
lady
lips
she
made
haste
to
add
i
did
mean
exactly
that
i
mean
i
never
did
anything
wrong
i
cross
sometimes
and
i
have
told
some
but
then
i
could
seem
to
help
it
things
were
in
such
a
tangle
it
comes
more
natural
to
me
to
tell
the
truth
that
i
can
readily
believe
rejoined
delano
but
i
am
not
trying
to
entrap
your
ingenuousness
into
a
betrayal
of
your
secrets
only
remember
one
thing
if
you
ever
do
want
to
open
your
heart
to
any
one
remember
that
i
am
your
true
friend
and
that
you
can
trust
me
o
thank
you
thank
you
exclaimed
flora
seizing
her
hand
and
kissing
it
fervently
but
tell
me
one
thing
my
little
friend
continued
delano
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
now
i
came
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
replied
flora
but
you
have
been
so
kind
to
me
that
it
has
made
me
almost
forget
my
errand
i
have
very
particular
reasons
for
wanting
to
earn
some
money
you
used
to
admire
the
in
nassau
so
much
that
i
thought
if
you
liked
mine
you
might
be
willing
to
buy
it
and
that
perhaps
you
might
have
friends
who
would
buy
some
i
have
tried
every
way
to
think
how
i
could
manage
to
sell
my
work
i
will
gladly
buy
all
you
have
rejoined
the
lady
and
i
should
like
to
have
you
make
me
some
more
especially
of
these
garlands
of
trembling
so
lightly
on
almost
invisible
silver
wire
i
will
make
some
immediately
replied
flora
but
i
must
go
dear
delano
i
wish
i
could
stay
longer
but
i
can
not
when
will
you
come
again
asked
the
lady
i
ca
tell
responded
flora
for
i
have
to
manage
to
come
here
that
seems
strange
said
delano
i
know
it
seems
strange
answered
the
young
girl
with
a
kind
of
despairing
impatience
in
her
tone
but
please
do
ask
me
for
everything
seems
to
come
right
out
to
you
and
i
do
know
what
i
ought
to
say
indeed
i
do
i
want
you
to
come
again
as
soon
as
you
can
said
delano
slipping
a
gold
eagle
into
her
hand
and
now
go
my
dear
before
you
tell
me
more
than
you
wish
to
not
more
than
i
wish
rejoined
floracita
but
more
than
i
ought
i
to
tell
you
everything
in
a
childish
way
she
put
up
her
lips
for
a
kiss
and
the
lady
drew
her
to
her
heart
and
caressed
her
tenderly
when
flora
had
descended
the
steps
of
the
piazza
she
turned
and
looked
up
delano
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
watching
her
departure
vines
of
gossamer
lightness
were
waving
round
her
and
her
pearly
complexion
and
dress
looked
lovely
among
those
aerial
arabesques
of
delicate
green
the
picture
impressed
flora
all
the
more
because
it
was
such
a
contrast
to
the
warm
and
gorgeous
styles
of
beauty
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
she
smiled
and
kissed
her
hand
in
token
of
farewell
the
lady
returned
the
salutation
but
she
thought
the
expression
of
her
face
was
sad
and
the
fear
that
this
new
friend
distrusted
her
on
account
of
unexplained
mysteries
haunted
her
on
her
way
homeward
delano
looked
after
her
till
she
and
her
donkey
disappeared
among
the
trees
in
the
distance
what
a
strange
mystery
is
this
murmured
she
alfred
royal
child
and
yet
she
bears
her
mother
name
and
why
does
she
conceal
from
me
where
she
lives
surely
she
can
not
be
consciously
doing
anything
wrong
for
i
never
saw
such
perfect
artlessness
of
look
and
manner
the
problem
occupied
her
thoughts
for
days
after
without
her
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
conjecture
flora
on
her
part
was
troubled
concerning
the
distrust
which
she
felt
must
be
excited
by
her
mysterious
position
and
she
was
continually
revolving
plans
to
clear
herself
from
suspicion
in
the
eyes
of
her
new
friend
it
would
have
been
an
inexpressible
consolation
if
she
could
have
told
her
troubles
to
her
elder
sister
from
whom
she
had
never
concealed
anything
till
within
the
last
few
weeks
but
alas
by
the
fault
of
another
a
barrier
had
arisen
between
them
which
proved
an
obstruction
at
every
turn
of
their
daily
intercourse
for
while
she
had
been
compelled
to
despise
and
dislike
gerald
rosa
was
always
eulogizing
his
noble
and
loving
nature
and
was
extremely
particular
to
have
his
slightest
wishes
obeyed
apart
from
any
secret
reasons
for
wishing
to
obtain
money
floracita
was
well
aware
that
it
would
not
do
to
confess
her
visit
to
delano
for
gerald
had
not
only
forbidden
their
making
any
acquaintances
but
he
had
also
charged
them
not
to
ride
or
walk
in
the
direction
of
either
of
the
plantations
unless
he
was
with
them
day
after
day
as
flora
sat
at
work
upon
the
garlands
she
had
promised
she
was
on
the
watch
to
elude
his
vigilance
but
more
than
a
week
passed
without
her
finding
any
safe
opportunity
at
last
gerald
proposed
to
gratify
rosa
wish
by
taking
a
sail
to
one
of
the
neighboring
islands
they
intended
to
make
a
picnic
of
it
and
return
by
moonlight
rosa
was
full
of
pleasant
anticipations
which
however
were
greatly
damped
when
her
sister
expressed
a
decided
preference
for
staying
at
home
rosa
entreated
and
gerald
became
angry
but
she
persisted
in
her
refusal
she
said
she
wanted
to
use
up
all
her
shells
and
all
her
flosses
and
chenilles
gerald
swore
that
he
hated
the
sight
of
them
and
that
he
would
throw
them
all
into
the
sea
if
she
went
on
wearing
her
beautiful
eyes
out
over
them
without
looking
up
from
her
work
she
coolly
answered
why
need
you
concern
yourself
about
eyes
when
you
have
a
wife
with
such
beautiful
eyes
black
tom
and
chloe
and
the
boat
were
in
waiting
and
after
a
flurried
scene
they
departed
reluctantly
without
her
i
never
saw
any
one
so
changed
as
she
is
said
rosa
she
used
to
be
so
fond
of
excursions
and
now
she
wants
to
work
from
morning
till
night
she
a
perverse
capricious
little
puss
she
been
too
much
indulged
she
needs
to
be
brought
under
discipline
said
gerald
angrily
whipping
off
a
blossom
with
his
rattan
as
they
walked
toward
the
boat
as
soon
as
they
were
fairly
off
flora
started
on
a
second
visit
to
the
welby
plantation
tulee
noticed
all
this
in
silence
and
shook
her
head
as
if
thoughts
were
brooding
there
unsafe
for
utterance
delano
was
bending
over
her
finishing
a
letter
when
she
perceived
a
wave
of
fragrance
and
looking
up
she
saw
flora
on
the
threshold
of
the
open
door
with
her
arms
full
of
flowers
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
said
she
dropping
one
of
her
little
quick
courtesies
which
seemed
half
frolic
half
politeness
the
woods
are
charming
the
trees
are
hung
with
curtains
of
jasmine
embroidered
all
over
with
golden
flowers
you
love
perfumes
so
well
i
could
help
stopping
by
the
way
to
load
thistle
with
an
armful
of
them
thank
you
dear
replied
delano
i
rode
out
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
the
flowery
woods
and
the
gorgeous
sunset
after
being
accustomed
to
the
splendor
of
these
southern
skies
the
northern
atmosphere
will
seem
cold
and
dull
shall
you
go
to
the
north
soon
inquired
flora
anxiously
i
shall
leave
here
in
ten
or
twelve
days
she
replied
but
i
may
wait
a
short
time
in
savannah
till
march
has
gone
for
that
is
a
blustering
disagreeable
month
in
new
england
though
it
brings
you
roses
and
perfume
i
came
to
savannah
to
spend
the
winter
with
my
friends
and
welby
but
i
have
always
taken
a
great
fancy
to
this
island
and
when
they
were
suddenly
called
away
to
arkansas
by
the
illness
of
a
son
i
asked
their
permission
to
come
here
for
a
few
weeks
and
watch
the
beautiful
opening
of
the
spring
i
find
myself
much
inclined
to
solitude
since
i
lost
a
darling
daughter
who
died
two
years
ago
if
she
had
lived
she
would
have
been
about
your
age
i
am
sorry
you
are
going
away
said
flora
it
seems
as
if
i
had
always
known
you
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
without
you
but
when
you
go
back
among
your
friends
i
suppose
you
will
forget
all
about
poor
little
me
no
my
dear
little
friend
i
shall
never
forget
you
she
replied
and
when
i
come
again
i
hope
i
shall
find
you
here
i
felt
troubled
when
i
went
away
the
other
day
said
flora
i
thought
you
seemed
to
look
sadly
after
me
and
i
was
afraid
you
thought
i
had
done
something
wicked
because
i
said
you
would
wish
i
were
your
daughter
if
you
knew
everything
about
me
so
i
have
come
to
tell
you
my
secrets
as
far
as
i
can
without
betraying
other
people
i
am
afraid
you
wo
care
anything
more
about
me
after
i
have
told
you
but
i
ca
help
it
if
you
do
even
that
would
be
better
than
to
have
you
suspect
me
of
being
bad
delano
drew
an
ottoman
toward
her
and
said
come
and
sit
here
dear
and
tell
me
all
about
it
the
same
as
if
i
were
your
mother
floracita
complied
and
resting
one
elbow
on
her
knee
and
leaning
her
cheek
upon
the
hand
she
looked
up
timidly
and
wistfully
into
the
friendly
face
that
was
smiling
serenely
over
her
after
a
pause
she
said
abruptly
i
do
know
how
to
begin
so
i
wo
begin
at
all
but
tell
it
right
out
you
see
dear
delano
i
am
a
colored
girl
the
lady
smile
came
nearer
to
a
laugh
than
was
usual
with
her
she
touched
the
pretty
dimpled
cheek
with
her
jewelled
finger
as
she
replied
o
you
mischievous
little
kitten
i
thought
you
were
really
going
to
tell
me
something
about
your
troubles
but
i
see
you
are
hoaxing
me
i
remember
when
you
were
at
madame
conquilla
you
always
seemed
to
be
full
of
fun
and
the
young
ladies
there
said
you
were
a
great
rogue
but
this
is
not
fun
indeed
it
is
not
rejoined
flora
i
a
colored
girl
she
spoke
so
earnestly
that
the
lady
began
to
doubt
the
evidence
of
her
own
eyes
but
you
told
me
that
alfred
royal
was
your
father
said
she
so
he
was
my
father
replied
flora
and
the
kindest
father
that
ever
was
rosa
and
i
were
brought
up
like
little
princesses
and
we
never
knew
that
we
were
colored
my
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
rich
spanish
gentleman
named
gonsalez
she
was
educated
in
paris
and
was
elegant
and
accomplished
she
was
handsomer
than
rosa
and
if
you
were
to
see
rosa
you
would
say
nobody
be
handsomer
than
she
is
she
was
good
too
my
father
was
always
saying
she
was
the
dearest
and
best
wife
in
the
world
you
do
know
how
he
mourned
when
she
died
he
could
bear
to
have
anything
moved
that
she
had
touched
but
died
very
suddenly
and
first
they
told
us
that
we
were
very
poor
and
must
earn
our
living
and
then
they
told
us
that
our
mother
was
a
slave
and
so
according
to
law
we
were
slaves
too
they
would
have
sold
us
at
auction
if
a
gentleman
who
knew
us
when
papa
was
alive
had
smuggled
us
away
privately
to
nassau
he
had
been
very
much
in
love
with
rosa
for
a
good
while
and
he
married
her
and
i
live
with
them
but
he
keeps
us
very
much
hidden
because
he
says
he
should
get
into
lawsuits
and
duels
and
all
sorts
of
troubles
with
papa
creditors
if
they
should
find
out
that
he
helped
us
off
and
that
was
the
reason
i
was
called
señorita
gonsalez
in
nassau
though
my
real
name
is
flora
royal
she
went
on
to
recount
the
kindness
of
madame
guirlande
and
the
exciting
particulars
of
their
escape
to
all
of
which
delano
listened
with
absorbed
attention
as
they
sat
thus
they
made
a
beautiful
picture
the
lady
mature
in
years
but
scarcely
showing
the
touch
of
time
was
almost
as
fair
as
an
albiness
with
serene
lips
and
a
soft
moonlight
expression
in
her
eyes
every
attitude
and
every
motion
indicated
quietude
and
refinement
the
young
girl
on
the
contrary
even
when
reclining
seemed
like
impetuosity
in
repose
for
a
moment
but
just
ready
to
spring
her
large
dark
eyes
laughed
and
flashed
and
wept
by
turns
and
her
warmly
tinted
face
glowed
like
the
sunlight
in
its
setting
of
glossy
black
hair
the
lady
looked
down
upon
her
with
undisguised
admiration
while
she
recounted
their
adventures
in
lively
dramatic
style
throwing
in
imitations
of
the
whistling
of
and
the
tones
of
the
coachman
as
he
sang
who
goes
there
but
you
have
not
told
me
said
delano
who
the
gentleman
was
that
married
your
sister
ah
i
see
you
hesitate
no
matter
only
tell
me
one
thing
is
he
kind
to
you
flora
turned
red
and
pale
and
red
again
let
that
pass
too
said
the
lady
i
asked
because
i
wished
to
know
if
i
could
help
you
in
any
way
i
see
you
have
brought
some
more
boxes
of
and
by
and
by
we
will
examine
them
but
first
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
also
have
a
secret
and
i
will
confide
it
to
you
that
you
may
feel
assured
i
shall
love
you
always
flora
dear
when
your
father
and
i
were
young
we
were
in
love
with
each
other
and
i
promised
to
be
his
wife
so
you
might
have
been
my
mamita
exclaimed
floracita
impetuously
no
not
mamita
dear
replied
delano
smiling
you
call
me
the
java
sparrow
and
java
sparrows
never
hatch
gay
little
or
tuneful
i
might
tell
you
a
long
story
about
myself
dear
but
the
sun
is
declining
and
you
ought
not
to
be
out
after
dusk
my
father
was
angry
about
our
love
because
alfred
was
then
only
a
clerk
with
a
small
salary
they
carried
me
off
to
europe
and
for
two
years
i
could
hear
nothing
from
alfred
then
they
told
me
he
was
married
and
after
a
while
they
persuaded
me
to
marry
delano
i
ought
not
to
have
married
him
because
my
heart
was
not
in
it
he
died
and
left
me
with
a
large
fortune
and
the
little
daughter
i
told
you
of
i
have
felt
very
much
alone
since
my
darling
was
taken
from
me
that
void
in
my
heart
renders
young
girls
very
interesting
to
me
your
looks
and
ways
attracted
me
when
i
first
met
you
and
when
you
told
me
alfred
royal
was
your
father
i
longed
to
clasp
you
to
my
heart
and
now
you
know
my
dear
child
that
you
have
a
friend
ever
ready
to
listen
to
any
troubles
you
may
choose
to
confide
and
desirous
to
remove
them
if
she
can
she
rose
to
open
the
boxes
of
but
flora
sprung
up
and
threw
herself
into
her
arms
saying
my
papasito
sent
you
to
me
i
know
he
did
after
a
few
moments
spent
in
silent
emotion
delano
again
spoke
of
the
approaching
twilight
and
with
mutual
caresses
they
bade
each
other
adieu
four
or
five
days
later
floracita
made
her
appearance
at
the
welby
plantation
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
she
was
in
a
nervous
tremor
and
her
eyelids
were
swollen
as
if
with
much
weeping
delano
hastened
to
enfold
her
in
her
arms
saying
what
is
it
my
child
tell
your
new
mamita
what
it
is
that
troubles
you
so
o
i
call
you
mamita
asked
flora
looking
up
with
an
expression
of
grateful
love
that
warmed
all
the
fibres
of
her
heart
o
i
do
so
need
a
mamita
i
am
very
wretched
and
if
you
help
me
i
do
know
what
i
do
certainly
i
will
help
you
if
possible
when
you
have
told
me
your
trouble
replied
delano
yes
i
will
tell
said
flora
sighing
fitzgerald
is
the
gentleman
who
married
my
sister
but
we
do
live
at
his
plantation
we
live
in
a
small
cottage
hidden
away
in
the
woods
you
never
saw
anybody
so
much
in
love
as
he
was
with
rosa
when
we
first
came
here
he
was
never
willing
to
have
her
out
of
his
sight
a
moment
and
rosa
loves
him
so
but
for
these
eight
or
ten
weeks
past
he
has
been
making
love
to
me
though
he
is
just
as
affectionate
as
ever
with
rosa
when
she
is
playing
to
him
and
i
am
singing
beside
her
he
keeps
throwing
kisses
to
me
behind
her
back
it
makes
me
feel
so
ashamed
that
i
look
my
sister
in
the
face
i
have
tried
to
keep
out
of
his
way
when
i
am
in
the
house
i
stick
to
rosa
like
a
burr
and
i
have
given
up
riding
or
walking
except
when
he
is
away
but
there
no
telling
when
he
away
he
went
away
yesterday
and
said
he
was
going
to
savannah
to
be
gone
a
week
but
this
morning
when
i
went
into
the
woods
behind
the
cottage
to
feed
thistle
he
was
lurking
there
he
seized
me
and
held
his
hand
over
my
mouth
and
said
i
hear
him
then
he
told
me
that
rosa
and
i
were
his
slaves
that
he
bought
us
of
papa
creditors
and
could
sell
us
any
day
and
he
says
he
will
carry
me
off
to
savannah
and
sell
me
if
i
do
treat
him
better
he
would
not
let
me
go
till
i
promised
to
meet
him
in
cypress
grove
at
dusk
i
have
been
trying
to
earn
money
to
go
to
madame
guirlande
and
get
her
to
send
me
somewhere
where
i
could
give
or
without
being
in
danger
of
being
taken
up
for
a
slave
but
i
do
know
how
to
get
to
new
orleans
alone
and
if
i
am
his
slave
i
am
afraid
he
will
come
there
with
officers
to
take
me
so
dear
new
mamita
i
have
come
to
you
to
see
if
you
ca
help
me
to
get
some
money
and
go
somewhere
delano
pressed
her
gently
to
her
heart
and
responded
in
tones
of
tenderest
pity
get
some
money
and
go
somewhere
you
poor
child
do
you
think
i
shall
let
dear
alfred
little
daughter
go
wandering
alone
about
the
world
no
darling
you
shall
live
with
me
and
be
my
daughter
and
do
you
care
about
my
being
colored
and
a
slave
asked
floracita
humbly
let
us
never
speak
of
that
replied
her
friend
the
whole
transaction
is
so
odious
and
wicked
that
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
i
do
feel
so
grateful
to
you
my
dear
new
mamita
that
i
do
know
what
to
say
but
it
tears
my
heart
in
two
to
leave
rosa
we
have
never
been
separated
for
a
day
since
i
was
born
and
she
is
so
good
and
she
loves
me
so
and
tulee
too
i
did
dare
to
try
to
speak
to
her
i
knew
i
should
break
down
all
the
way
coming
here
i
was
frightened
for
fear
gerald
would
overtake
me
and
carry
me
off
and
i
cried
so
thinking
about
rosa
and
tulee
not
knowing
when
i
should
see
them
again
that
i
could
see
and
if
thistle
had
known
the
way
himself
i
should
have
got
here
poor
thistle
it
seemed
as
if
my
heart
would
break
when
i
threw
the
bridle
on
his
neck
and
left
him
to
go
back
alone
i
did
dare
to
hug
him
but
once
i
was
so
afraid
o
i
am
so
glad
that
you
will
let
me
stay
here
i
have
been
thinking
it
will
not
be
prudent
for
you
to
stay
here
my
child
replied
delano
search
will
be
made
for
you
in
the
morning
and
you
had
better
be
out
of
the
way
before
that
there
are
some
dresses
belonging
to
welby
daughter
in
a
closet
up
stairs
i
will
borrow
one
of
them
for
you
to
wear
the
boat
from
beaufort
to
savannah
will
stop
here
in
an
hour
to
take
some
freight
we
will
go
to
savannah
my
colored
laundress
there
has
a
chamber
above
her
where
you
will
be
better
concealed
than
in
more
genteel
lodgings
i
will
come
back
here
to
arrange
things
and
in
a
few
days
i
will
return
to
you
and
take
you
to
my
northern
home
the
necessary
arrangements
were
soon
made
and
when
flora
was
transformed
into
miss
welby
she
smiled
very
faintly
as
she
remarked
how
queer
it
seems
to
be
always
running
away
this
is
the
last
time
my
child
replied
delano
i
will
keep
my
little
bird
carefully
under
my
wings
when
flora
was
in
the
boat
hand
in
hand
with
her
new
friend
and
no
one
visible
whom
she
had
ever
seen
before
her
excitement
began
to
subside
but
sadness
increased
in
her
terror
the
poor
child
had
scarcely
thought
of
anything
except
the
necessity
of
escaping
somewhere
but
when
she
saw
her
island
home
receding
from
her
she
began
to
realize
the
importance
of
the
step
she
was
taking
she
fixed
her
gaze
on
that
part
where
the
lonely
cottage
was
embowered
and
she
had
a
longing
to
see
even
a
little
whiff
of
smoke
from
kitchen
but
there
was
no
sign
of
life
save
a
large
like
a
black
vulture
sailing
gracefully
over
the
the
beloved
sister
the
faithful
servant
the
brother
from
whom
she
had
once
hoped
so
much
the
patient
animal
that
had
borne
her
through
so
many
pleasant
paths
the
flowery
woods
and
the
resounding
sea
had
all
vanished
from
her
as
suddenly
as
did
her
father
and
the
bright
home
of
her
childhood
the
scenes
through
which
they
were
passing
were
beautiful
as
paradise
and
all
nature
seemed
alive
and
jubilant
the
white
blossoms
of
twinkled
among
dark
evergreens
a
vegetable
imitation
of
starlight
oaks
and
superb
magnolias
were
lighted
up
with
sudden
flashes
of
color
as
scarlet
grosbeaks
flitted
from
tree
to
tree
sparrows
were
chirping
doves
cooing
and
whistling
now
running
up
the
scale
then
down
the
scale
with
an
infinity
of
variations
between
the
outbursts
of
the
birds
were
the
same
as
in
seasons
that
were
gone
but
the
listener
was
changed
rarely
before
had
her
quick
musical
ear
failed
to
notice
how
they
would
repeat
the
same
note
with
greater
or
less
emphasis
then
flat
it
then
sharp
it
varying
their
performances
with
all
manner
of
unexpected
changes
but
now
she
was
merely
vaguely
conscious
of
familiar
sounds
which
brought
before
her
that
last
merry
day
in
her
father
house
when
rosabella
laughed
so
much
to
hear
her
puzzle
the
birds
with
her
musical
vagaries
memory
held
up
her
magic
mirror
in
which
she
saw
pictured
processions
of
the
vanished
years
thus
the
lonely
child
with
her
loving
lingering
looks
upon
the
past
was
floated
toward
an
unknown
future
with
the
new
friend
a
kind
providence
had
sent
her
chapter
ix
rosa
was
surprised
at
the
long
absence
of
her
sister
and
when
the
sun
showed
only
a
narrow
golden
edge
above
the
horizon
she
began
to
feel
anxious
she
went
to
the
kitchen
and
said
tulee
have
you
seen
anything
of
floracita
lately
she
went
away
while
i
was
sleeping
no
missy
she
replied
the
last
i
see
of
her
was
in
her
room
with
the
before
her
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
as
she
did
sometimes
as
if
she
was
looking
nowhere
she
jumped
up
and
hugged
and
kissed
me
and
called
me
tulee
good
tulee
the
little
darling
was
always
mighty
loving
when
i
went
there
again
her
needle
was
sticking
in
her
work
and
her
thimble
was
on
the
frame
but
she
was
gone
i
do
know
when
she
went
away
thistle
come
back
alone
but
he
does
that
sometimes
when
little
missy
goes
rambling
round
there
was
no
uneasiness
expressed
in
her
tones
but
being
more
disquieted
than
she
wished
to
acknowledge
she
went
forth
to
search
the
neighboring
and
the
when
she
returned
rosa
ran
out
with
the
eager
inquiry
is
she
anywhere
in
sight
in
reply
to
the
negative
answer
she
said
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
have
you
ever
seen
anybody
with
floracita
since
we
came
here
nobody
but
massa
gerald
replied
tulee
i
wonder
whether
she
was
discontented
here
said
rosa
i
do
see
why
she
should
be
for
we
all
loved
her
dearly
and
gerald
was
as
kind
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
his
own
sister
but
she
has
seemed
like
herself
lately
and
this
forenoon
she
hugged
and
kissed
me
ever
so
many
times
and
cried
when
i
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
said
she
was
thinking
of
the
pleasant
times
when
was
alive
do
you
think
she
was
unhappy
she
told
me
once
she
was
homesick
for
madame
guirlande
replied
tulee
did
she
perhaps
she
was
making
so
many
things
for
madame
because
she
meant
to
go
there
but
she
could
find
her
way
alone
and
she
knew
it
would
be
very
dangerous
for
either
of
us
to
go
to
new
orleans
tulee
made
no
reply
she
seated
herself
on
a
wooden
bench
by
the
open
door
swinging
her
body
back
and
forth
in
an
agitated
way
ever
and
anon
jumping
up
and
looking
round
in
all
directions
the
veil
of
twilight
descended
upon
the
earth
and
darkness
followed
the
two
inmates
of
the
cottage
felt
very
miserable
and
helpless
as
they
sat
there
listening
to
every
sound
for
a
while
nothing
was
heard
but
the
dash
of
the
waves
and
the
occasional
hooting
of
an
owl
the
moon
rose
up
above
the
pines
and
flooded
earth
and
sea
with
silvery
splendor
i
want
to
go
to
the
plantation
and
call
tom
said
rosa
and
there
is
such
bright
moonshine
we
might
go
but
i
am
afraid
gerald
would
be
displeased
tulee
at
once
volunteered
to
bring
out
thistle
and
to
walk
beside
her
mistress
both
started
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
they
were
not
light
enough
for
floracita
but
they
thought
it
might
be
some
one
bringing
news
it
proved
to
be
the
master
of
the
house
why
gerald
how
glad
i
am
i
thought
you
were
in
savannah
exclaimed
rosa
have
you
seen
anything
of
floracita
no
is
she
here
inquired
he
in
such
a
tone
of
surprise
that
tulee
suspicions
were
shaken
rosa
repeated
the
story
of
her
disappearance
and
concluded
by
saying
she
told
tulee
she
was
homesick
to
go
to
madame
she
surely
would
dare
to
do
that
he
replied
massa
gerald
said
tulee
and
she
watched
him
closely
while
she
spoke
there
something
i
did
tell
missy
rosy
i
was
feared
it
would
worry
her
i
found
this
little
glove
of
missy
flory
with
a
bunch
of
down
on
the
beach
and
there
was
marks
of
her
feet
all
round
rosa
uttered
a
cry
o
heavens
she
exclaimed
i
saw
an
alligator
a
few
days
ago
an
expression
of
horror
passed
over
his
face
i
cautioned
her
not
to
fish
so
much
for
shells
and
said
he
but
she
was
always
so
say
anything
against
the
little
darling
implored
rosa
perhaps
we
shall
never
see
her
again
he
spoke
a
few
soothing
words
and
then
took
his
hat
saying
i
am
going
to
the
take
good
care
of
yourself
dear
gerald
cried
rosa
no
danger
that
muttered
tulee
as
she
walked
out
of
hearing
there
things
with
handsomer
mouths
than
alligators
that
may
be
more
dangerous
poor
little
bird
i
wonder
where
he
has
put
her
his
feelings
as
he
roamed
on
the
beach
were
not
to
be
envied
his
mind
was
divided
between
the
thoughts
that
she
had
committed
suicide
or
had
been
drowned
accidentally
that
she
had
escaped
from
his
persecutions
by
flight
he
could
not
believe
for
he
knew
she
was
entirely
unused
to
taking
care
of
herself
and
felt
sure
she
had
no
one
to
help
her
he
returned
to
say
that
the
tide
had
washed
away
the
footprints
and
that
he
found
no
vestige
of
the
lost
one
at
dawn
he
started
for
the
plantation
whence
after
fruitless
inquiries
he
rode
to
the
welby
estate
delano
had
requested
the
household
servants
not
to
mention
having
seen
a
small
young
lady
there
and
they
had
nothing
to
communicate
he
resolved
to
start
for
new
orleans
as
soon
as
possible
after
a
fortnight
absence
he
returned
bringing
grieved
and
sympathizing
letters
from
the
signor
and
madame
and
on
the
minds
of
all
except
tulee
the
conviction
settled
that
floracita
was
drowned
hope
lingered
long
in
her
mind
wherever
the
little
pet
may
be
surely
contrive
to
let
us
know
thought
she
she
ai
like
the
poor
slaves
when
carried
off
she
can
write
her
mistress
talked
with
her
every
day
about
the
lost
darling
but
of
course
such
suspicions
were
not
to
be
mentioned
to
her
gerald
who
disliked
everything
mournful
avoided
the
subject
entirely
and
rosabella
looking
upon
him
only
with
the
eyes
of
love
considered
it
a
sign
of
deep
feeling
and
respected
it
accordingly
but
blinded
as
she
was
she
gradually
became
aware
that
he
did
not
seem
exactly
like
the
same
man
who
first
won
her
girlish
love
her
efforts
to
please
him
were
not
always
successful
he
was
sometimes
moody
and
fretful
he
swore
at
the
slightest
annoyance
and
often
flew
into
paroxysms
of
anger
with
tom
and
tulee
he
was
more
and
more
absent
from
the
cottage
and
made
few
professions
of
regret
for
such
frequent
separations
some
weeks
after
flora
disappearance
he
announced
his
intention
to
travel
in
the
north
during
the
summer
months
rosabella
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
pleading
expression
but
pride
prevented
her
from
asking
whether
she
might
accompany
him
she
waited
in
hopes
he
would
propose
it
but
as
he
did
not
even
think
of
it
he
failed
to
interpret
the
look
of
disappointment
in
her
expressive
eyes
as
she
turned
from
him
with
a
sigh
tom
will
come
with
the
carriage
once
a
week
said
he
and
either
he
or
joe
will
be
here
every
night
thank
you
she
replied
but
the
tone
was
so
sad
that
he
took
her
hand
with
the
tenderness
of
former
times
and
said
you
are
sorry
to
part
with
me
bella
rosa
how
can
i
be
otherwise
than
sorry
she
asked
when
i
am
all
alone
in
the
world
without
you
dear
gerald
are
we
always
to
live
thus
will
you
never
acknowledge
me
as
your
wife
how
can
i
do
it
rejoined
he
without
putting
myself
in
the
power
of
those
cursed
creditors
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
that
your
mother
was
a
slave
we
should
be
secure
from
them
in
europe
she
replied
why
we
live
abroad
do
you
suppose
my
rich
uncle
would
leave
me
a
cent
if
he
found
out
i
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
quadroon
rejoined
he
i
have
met
with
losses
lately
and
i
ca
afford
to
offend
my
uncle
i
am
sorry
dear
that
you
are
dissatisfied
with
the
home
i
have
provided
for
you
i
am
not
dissatisfied
with
my
home
said
she
i
have
no
desire
to
mix
with
the
world
but
it
is
necessary
for
you
and
these
separations
are
dreadful
his
answer
was
i
will
write
often
dearest
and
i
will
send
you
quantities
of
new
music
i
shall
always
be
looking
forward
to
the
delight
of
hearing
it
when
i
return
you
must
take
good
care
of
your
health
for
my
sake
you
must
go
ambling
about
with
thistle
every
day
the
suggestion
brought
up
associations
that
overcame
her
at
once
o
how
floracita
loved
thistle
she
exclaimed
and
it
really
seems
as
if
the
poor
beast
misses
her
i
am
afraid
we
neglected
her
too
much
gerald
we
were
so
taken
up
with
our
own
happiness
that
we
think
of
her
so
much
as
we
ought
to
have
done
i
am
sure
i
tried
to
gratify
all
her
wishes
responded
he
i
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
and
certainly
you
were
always
a
devoted
sister
this
is
a
morbid
state
of
feeling
and
you
must
try
to
drive
it
off
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
you
wanted
to
see
how
the
plantation
was
looking
and
what
flowers
had
come
out
in
the
garden
shall
i
take
you
there
in
the
barouche
she
gladly
assented
and
a
few
affectionate
words
soon
restored
her
confidence
in
his
love
when
the
carriage
was
brought
to
the
entrance
of
the
wood
the
next
day
she
went
to
meet
it
with
a
smiling
face
and
a
springing
step
as
he
was
about
to
hand
her
in
he
said
abruptly
you
have
forgotten
your
veil
tulee
was
summoned
to
bring
it
as
rosa
arranged
it
round
her
head
she
remarked
one
would
think
you
were
ashamed
of
me
gerald
the
words
were
almost
whispered
but
the
tone
sounded
more
like
a
reproach
than
anything
she
had
ever
uttered
with
ready
gallantry
he
responded
aloud
i
think
so
much
of
my
treasure
that
i
want
to
keep
it
all
to
myself
he
was
very
affectionate
during
their
drive
and
this
combined
with
the
genial
air
the
lovely
scenery
and
the
exhilaration
of
swift
motion
restored
her
to
a
greater
sense
of
happiness
than
she
had
felt
since
her
darling
sister
vanished
so
suddenly
the
plantation
was
in
gala
dress
the
veranda
was
almost
covered
with
the
large
white
stars
of
the
cherokee
rose
gleaming
out
from
its
dark
lustrous
foliage
the
lawn
was
a
sheet
of
green
velvet
embroidered
with
flowers
magnolias
and
oaks
of
magnificent
growth
ornamented
the
extensive
grounds
in
the
rear
was
a
cluster
of
negro
huts
black
picaninnies
were
rolling
about
in
the
grass
mingling
their
laughter
with
the
songs
of
the
birds
the
winding
paths
of
the
garden
were
lined
with
flowering
shrubs
and
the
sea
sparkled
in
the
distance
wherever
the
eye
glanced
all
was
sunshine
bloom
and
verdure
for
the
first
time
he
invited
her
to
enter
the
mansion
her
first
movement
was
toward
the
piano
as
she
opened
it
and
swept
her
hand
across
the
keys
he
said
it
is
sadly
out
of
tune
it
has
been
neglected
because
its
owner
had
pleasanter
music
elsewhere
but
the
tones
are
very
fine
rejoined
she
what
a
pity
it
be
used
as
she
glanced
out
of
the
window
on
the
blooming
garden
and
spacious
lawn
she
said
how
pleasant
it
would
be
if
we
could
live
here
it
is
so
delightful
to
look
out
on
such
an
extensive
open
space
perhaps
we
will
some
time
or
other
my
love
responded
he
she
smiled
and
touched
the
keys
while
she
sang
snatches
of
familiar
songs
the
servants
who
brought
in
refreshments
wondered
at
her
beauty
and
clear
ringing
voice
many
dark
faces
clustered
round
the
crack
of
the
door
to
obtain
a
peep
and
as
they
went
away
they
exchanged
nudges
and
winks
with
each
other
tom
and
chloe
had
confidentially
whispered
to
some
of
them
the
existence
of
such
a
lady
and
that
tulee
said
massa
married
her
in
the
west
indies
and
they
predicted
that
she
would
be
the
future
mistress
of
magnolia
lawn
others
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
massa
would
never
hide
her
as
he
did
if
she
was
to
be
the
missis
but
all
agreed
that
she
was
a
beautiful
grand
lady
and
they
paid
her
homage
accordingly
her
cheeks
would
have
burned
to
scarlet
flame
if
she
had
heard
all
their
comments
and
conjectures
but
unconscious
of
blame
or
shame
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
those
bright
hours
a
new
access
of
tenderness
seemed
to
have
come
over
fitzgerald
partly
because
happiness
rendered
her
beauty
more
radiant
and
partly
because
secret
thoughts
that
were
revolving
in
his
mind
brought
some
twinges
of
remorse
he
had
never
seemed
more
enamored
not
even
during
the
first
week
in
nassau
when
he
came
to
claim
her
as
his
bride
far
down
in
the
garden
was
an
umbrageous
walk
terminating
in
a
bower
they
remained
there
a
long
time
intertwined
in
each
arms
talking
over
the
memories
of
their
dawning
consciousness
of
love
and
singing
together
the
melodies
in
which
their
voices
had
first
mingled
their
road
home
was
through
woods
and
groves
festooned
with
vines
some
hanging
in
massive
coils
others
light
and
aerial
enough
for
fairy
swings
then
over
the
smooth
beach
where
wave
after
wave
leaped
up
and
tossed
its
white
on
the
shore
the
sun
was
sinking
in
a
golden
sea
and
higher
toward
the
zenith
little
gossamer
clouds
blushingly
dissolved
in
the
brilliant
azure
and
united
again
as
if
the
fragrance
of
roses
had
floated
into
form
when
they
reached
the
cottage
rosa
passed
through
the
silent
little
parlor
with
swimming
eyes
murmuring
to
herself
poor
little
floracita
how
the
sea
made
me
think
of
her
i
ought
not
to
have
been
so
happy
but
memory
wrote
the
record
of
that
halcyon
day
in
illuminated
manuscript
all
glowing
with
purple
and
gold
with
angel
faces
peeping
through
a
graceful
network
of
flowers
chapter
rosabella
had
never
experienced
such
loneliness
as
in
the
months
that
followed
all
music
was
saddened
by
echoes
of
past
accompaniments
embroidery
lost
its
interest
with
no
one
to
praise
the
work
or
to
be
consulted
in
the
choice
of
colors
and
patterns
the
books
gerald
occasionally
sent
were
of
a
light
character
and
though
they
served
to
while
away
a
listless
hour
there
was
nothing
in
them
to
strengthen
or
refresh
the
soul
the
isolation
was
the
more
painful
because
there
was
everything
around
her
to
remind
her
of
the
lost
and
the
absent
flora
unfinished
embroidery
still
remained
in
the
frame
with
the
needle
in
the
last
stitch
of
a
blue
over
the
mirror
was
a
cluster
of
she
had
made
on
the
wall
was
a
spray
of
she
had
pressed
and
surrounded
with
a
garland
of
small
shells
by
the
door
was
a
vine
she
had
transplanted
from
the
woods
and
under
a
tree
opposite
was
a
turf
seat
where
she
used
to
sit
sketching
the
cottage
and
tulee
and
thistle
and
baskets
of
she
had
gathered
the
sight
of
these
things
continually
brought
up
visions
of
the
loving
and
beautiful
child
who
for
so
many
years
had
slept
nestling
in
her
arms
and
made
the
days
tuneful
with
her
songs
then
there
was
gerald
silent
flute
and
the
silken
cushion
she
had
embroidered
for
him
on
which
she
had
so
often
seen
him
reposing
and
thought
him
handsome
as
a
sleeping
adonis
a
letter
from
him
made
her
cheerful
for
days
but
they
did
not
come
often
and
were
generally
brief
tom
came
with
the
carriage
once
a
week
according
to
his
master
orders
but
she
found
solitary
drives
so
little
refreshing
to
body
or
mind
that
she
was
often
glad
to
avail
herself
of
tulee
company
so
the
summer
wore
away
and
september
came
to
produce
a
new
aspect
of
beauty
in
the
landscape
by
tinging
the
fading
flowers
and
withering
leaves
with
various
shades
of
brown
and
crimson
purple
and
orange
one
day
early
in
the
month
when
tom
came
with
the
carriage
she
told
him
to
drive
to
magnolia
lawn
she
had
long
been
wishing
to
revisit
the
scene
where
she
had
been
so
happy
on
that
bright
spring
day
but
she
had
always
said
to
herself
i
will
wait
till
gerald
comes
now
she
had
grown
so
weary
with
hope
deferred
that
she
felt
as
if
she
could
wait
no
longer
as
she
rode
along
she
thought
of
improvements
in
the
walks
that
she
would
suggest
to
gerald
if
they
ever
went
there
to
live
as
he
had
intimated
they
might
the
servants
received
her
with
their
usual
respectful
manner
and
wondering
looks
but
when
she
turned
back
to
ask
some
question
she
saw
them
whispering
together
with
an
unusual
appearance
of
excitement
her
cheeks
glowed
with
a
consciousness
that
her
anomalous
position
was
well
calculated
to
excite
their
curiosity
and
she
turned
away
thinking
how
different
it
had
been
with
her
mother
how
sheltered
and
protected
she
had
always
been
she
remembered
how
very
rarely
her
father
left
home
and
how
he
always
hastened
to
return
she
stood
awhile
on
the
veranda
thinking
sadly
if
gerald
loves
me
as
papasito
loved
mamita
how
can
he
be
contented
to
leave
me
so
much
with
a
deep
sigh
she
turned
and
entered
the
house
through
an
open
window
the
sigh
changed
at
once
to
a
bright
smile
the
parlor
had
undergone
a
wondrous
transformation
since
she
last
saw
it
the
woodwork
had
been
freshly
painted
and
the
walls
were
covered
with
paper
over
curtains
of
embroidered
lace
hung
a
drapery
of
damask
ornamented
with
deep
fringe
and
heavy
tassels
how
kind
of
gerald
murmured
she
he
has
done
this
because
i
expressed
a
wish
to
live
here
how
ungrateful
i
was
to
doubt
him
in
my
thoughts
she
passed
into
the
chamber
where
she
found
a
white
french
bedstead
on
which
were
painted
bouquets
of
roses
it
was
enveloped
in
roseate
lace
drapery
caught
up
at
the
centre
in
festoons
on
the
silver
arrow
of
a
pretty
little
cupid
from
silver
arrows
over
the
windows
there
fell
the
same
soft
roseate
folds
her
whole
face
was
illuminated
with
happiness
as
she
thought
to
herself
ah
i
know
why
everything
has
a
tinge
of
how
kind
of
him
to
prepare
such
a
beautiful
surprise
for
me
she
traversed
the
garden
walks
and
lingered
long
in
the
sequestered
bower
on
the
floor
was
a
bunch
of
dried
violets
which
he
had
placed
in
her
belt
on
that
happy
day
she
took
them
up
kissed
them
fervently
and
placed
them
near
her
heart
that
heart
was
lighter
than
it
had
been
for
months
at
last
he
is
going
to
acknowledge
me
as
his
wife
thought
she
how
happy
i
shall
be
when
there
is
no
longer
any
need
of
secrecy
the
servants
heard
her
singing
as
she
traversed
the
garden
and
gathered
in
groups
to
listen
but
they
scattered
as
they
saw
her
approach
the
house
she
a
mighty
fine
lady
said
dinah
the
cook
mighty
fine
lady
repeated
tom
an
i
tell
yer
she
married
to
massa
an
she
gwine
to
be
de
missis
venus
the
chambermaid
who
would
have
passed
very
well
for
a
bronze
image
of
the
goddess
tossed
her
head
as
she
replied
dunno
bout
dat
ar
massa
does
a
heap
o
courtin
to
we
far
sex
how
yer
know
dat
ar
exclaimed
dinah
whar
d
yer
git
dem
and
then
there
was
a
general
titter
rosabella
all
unconscious
in
her
purity
came
up
to
tom
while
the
grin
was
still
upon
his
face
and
in
her
polite
way
asked
him
to
have
the
goodness
to
bring
the
carriage
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
she
could
refrain
from
outbursts
of
song
as
she
rode
homeward
but
gerald
had
particularly
requested
her
not
to
sing
in
the
carriage
lest
her
voice
should
attract
the
attention
of
some
one
who
chanced
to
be
visiting
the
island
her
first
words
when
she
entered
the
cottage
were
o
tulee
i
am
happy
gerald
has
fitted
up
magnolia
lawn
beautifully
because
i
told
him
i
wished
we
could
live
there
he
said
that
day
we
were
there
that
he
would
try
to
make
some
arrangement
with
papasito
creditors
and
i
do
believe
he
has
and
that
i
shall
not
have
to
hide
much
longer
he
has
been
fitting
up
the
house
as
if
it
were
for
a
queen
is
he
kind
tulee
who
listened
rather
distrustfully
to
praises
bestowed
on
the
master
replied
that
nobody
could
do
anything
too
good
for
missy
rosy
ah
tulee
you
have
always
done
your
best
to
spoil
me
said
she
laying
her
hand
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
of
her
petted
servant
while
a
smile
like
sunshine
mantled
her
face
but
do
get
me
something
to
eat
the
ride
has
made
me
hungry
ise
glad
to
hear
that
missy
rosy
i
begun
to
think
want
no
use
to
cook
nice
tidbits
for
ye
if
ye
jist
turned
over
wi
yer
fork
and
ate
one
or
two
mouthfuls
without
knowing
what
ye
was
eatin
i
been
pining
for
gerald
tulee
and
i
been
afraid
sometimes
that
he
did
love
me
as
he
used
to
do
but
now
that
he
has
made
such
preparations
for
us
to
live
at
magnolia
lawn
i
am
as
happy
as
a
queen
she
went
off
singing
and
as
tulee
looked
after
her
she
murmured
to
herself
and
what
a
handsome
queen
she
make
gold
ai
none
too
good
for
her
to
walk
on
but
is
it
the
truth
he
told
her
about
settling
with
the
creditors
there
never
no
telling
anything
by
what
says
do
hear
her
singing
now
it
sounds
as
lively
as
missy
flory
ah
that
was
a
strange
business
i
wonder
whether
the
little
darling
dead
while
she
was
preparing
supper
with
such
cogitations
passing
through
her
mind
rosa
began
to
dash
off
a
letter
as
follows
dearly
beloved
i
am
so
happy
that
i
can
not
wait
a
minute
without
telling
you
about
it
i
have
done
a
naughty
thing
but
as
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
disobeyed
you
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
you
told
me
never
to
go
to
the
plantation
without
you
but
i
waited
and
waited
and
you
did
come
and
we
were
so
happy
there
that
lovely
day
that
i
longed
to
go
again
i
knew
it
would
be
very
lonesome
without
you
but
i
thought
it
would
be
some
comfort
to
see
again
the
places
where
we
walked
together
and
sang
together
and
called
each
other
all
manner
of
foolish
fond
names
do
you
remember
how
many
variations
you
rung
upon
my
name
rosabella
rosalinda
rosamunda
rosa
regina
how
you
did
pelt
me
with
roses
do
you
remember
how
happy
we
were
in
the
garden
bower
how
we
sang
together
the
canzonet
in
thine
eyes
forever
plays
and
how
the
imitated
your
guitar
while
you
were
singing
the
don
giovanni
serenade
i
was
thinking
this
all
over
as
i
rode
alone
over
the
same
ground
we
traversed
on
that
happy
day
but
it
was
so
different
without
the
of
your
eyes
and
the
pressure
of
your
dear
hand
that
i
felt
the
tears
gathering
and
had
all
manner
of
sad
thoughts
i
feared
you
did
care
for
me
as
you
used
to
do
and
were
finding
it
easy
to
live
without
me
but
when
i
entered
the
parlor
that
overlooks
the
beautiful
lawn
all
my
doubts
vanished
you
had
encouraged
me
to
hope
that
it
might
be
our
future
home
but
i
little
dreamed
it
was
to
be
so
soon
and
that
you
were
preparing
such
a
charming
surprise
for
me
do
be
vexed
with
me
dearest
for
finding
out
your
secret
it
made
me
happy
it
made
the
world
seem
like
paradise
ah
i
why
everything
was
so
it
was
so
like
to
think
of
that
then
everything
is
so
elegant
you
knew
your
rosamunda
taste
for
elegance
but
tulee
summons
me
to
supper
dear
good
faithful
tulee
what
a
comfort
she
has
been
to
me
in
this
lonesome
time
now
i
have
come
back
to
the
pretty
little
you
gave
me
and
i
will
finish
my
letter
i
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
write
to
you
forever
if
i
ca
have
you
to
talk
to
you
ca
imagine
how
lonesome
i
have
been
the
new
music
you
sent
me
was
charming
but
whatever
i
practised
or
improvised
took
a
solemn
and
plaintive
character
like
the
moaning
of
the
sea
and
the
whispering
of
the
pines
one
own
voice
sounds
so
solitary
when
there
is
no
other
voice
to
lean
upon
and
no
appreciating
ear
to
listen
for
the
coming
chords
i
have
even
found
it
a
relief
to
play
and
sing
to
tulee
who
is
always
an
admiring
listener
if
not
a
very
discriminating
one
and
as
for
tom
it
seems
as
if
the
eyes
would
fly
out
of
his
head
when
i
play
to
him
i
have
tried
to
take
exercise
every
day
as
you
advised
but
while
the
hot
weather
lasted
i
was
afraid
of
snakes
and
the
mosquitoes
and
were
tormenting
now
it
is
cooler
i
ramble
about
more
but
my
loneliness
goes
everywhere
with
me
everything
is
so
still
here
that
it
sometimes
makes
me
afraid
the
moonlight
looks
awfully
solemn
on
the
dark
pines
you
remember
that
dead
the
wind
has
broken
it
and
there
it
stands
in
front
of
the
evergreen
grove
with
two
arms
spread
out
and
a
knot
like
a
head
with
a
hat
on
it
and
a
streamer
of
moss
hanging
from
it
it
looks
so
white
and
strange
in
the
moonlight
that
it
seems
as
if
floracita
spirit
were
beckoning
to
me
but
i
did
mean
to
write
about
sad
things
i
do
feel
sad
now
i
was
only
telling
you
how
lonely
and
nervous
i
been
that
you
might
imagine
how
much
good
it
has
done
me
to
see
such
kind
arrangements
at
magnolia
lawn
forgive
me
for
going
there
contrary
to
your
orders
i
did
so
long
for
a
little
variety
i
could
have
dreamed
you
were
planning
such
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
we
be
happy
there
calling
one
another
all
the
old
foolish
pet
names
dear
good
gerald
i
shall
never
again
have
any
ungrateful
doubts
of
your
love
luz
de
mes
come
soon
to
your
grateful
and
loving
rosa
that
evening
the
plash
of
the
waves
no
longer
seemed
like
a
requiem
over
her
lost
sister
the
moonlight
gave
poetic
beauty
to
the
pines
and
even
the
blasted
tree
with
its
waving
streamer
of
moss
seemed
only
another
picturesque
feature
in
the
landscape
so
truly
does
nature
give
us
back
a
reflection
of
our
souls
she
waked
from
a
refreshing
sleep
with
a
consciousness
of
happiness
unknown
for
a
long
time
when
tom
came
to
say
he
was
going
to
savannah
she
commissioned
him
to
go
to
the
store
where
her
dresses
were
usually
ordered
and
buy
some
fine
french
merino
she
gave
him
very
minute
directions
accompanied
with
a
pattern
that
is
gerald
favorite
color
she
said
to
herself
i
will
embroider
it
with
white
and
tie
it
with
white
silk
cord
and
tassels
the
first
time
we
breakfast
together
at
magnolia
lawn
i
will
wear
it
fastened
at
the
throat
with
that
pretty
little
knot
of
silver
filigree
he
gave
me
on
my
birthday
then
i
shall
look
as
bridal
as
the
home
he
is
preparing
for
me
the
embroidery
of
this
dress
furnished
pleasant
occupation
for
many
days
when
it
was
half
finished
she
tried
it
on
before
the
mirror
and
smiled
to
see
how
becoming
was
the
effect
she
queried
whether
gerald
would
like
one
or
two
of
madame
guirlande
pale
artificial
nasturtiums
in
her
hair
she
placed
them
coquettishly
by
the
side
of
her
head
for
a
moment
and
laid
them
down
saying
to
herself
no
too
much
dress
for
the
morning
he
will
like
better
the
plain
braids
of
my
hair
with
the
curls
falling
over
them
as
she
sat
hour
after
hour
embroidering
the
dress
which
was
expected
to
produce
such
a
sensation
tulee
heart
was
gladdened
by
hearing
her
sing
almost
continually
bless
her
dear
heart
exclaimed
she
that
sounds
like
the
old
times
but
when
a
fortnight
passed
without
an
answer
to
her
letter
the
showers
of
melody
subsided
shadows
of
old
doubts
began
to
creep
over
the
inward
sunshine
though
she
tried
to
drive
them
away
by
recalling
gerald
promise
to
try
to
secure
her
safety
by
making
a
compromise
with
her
father
creditors
and
were
not
the
new
arrangements
at
magnolia
lawn
a
sign
that
he
had
accomplished
his
generous
purpose
she
was
asking
herself
that
question
for
the
hundredth
time
as
she
sat
looking
out
on
the
twilight
landscape
when
she
heard
a
voice
approaching
singing
qui
fait
le
monde
à
la
ronde
and
a
moment
after
she
was
folded
in
arms
and
he
was
calling
her
endearing
names
in
a
polyglot
of
languages
which
he
had
learned
from
her
and
floracita
so
you
are
not
very
angry
with
me
for
going
there
and
finding
out
your
secret
inquired
she
i
angry
he
replied
but
while
i
was
coming
to
you
all
my
anger
melted
away
and
you
do
love
me
as
well
as
ever
said
she
i
thought
perhaps
so
many
handsome
ladies
would
fall
in
love
with
you
that
i
should
not
be
your
rosa
any
more
i
have
met
many
handsome
ladies
responded
he
but
never
one
worthy
to
bear
the
train
of
my
rosa
regina
thus
the
evening
passed
in
conversation
more
agreeable
to
them
than
the
wittiest
or
the
wisest
would
have
been
but
it
has
been
well
said
the
words
of
lovers
are
like
the
rich
wines
of
the
south
they
are
delicious
in
their
native
soil
but
will
not
bear
transportation
the
next
morning
he
announced
the
necessity
of
returning
to
the
north
to
complete
some
business
and
said
he
must
in
the
mean
time
spend
some
hours
at
the
plantation
and
rosa
dear
added
he
i
shall
really
be
angry
with
you
if
you
go
there
again
unless
i
am
with
you
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
and
said
with
one
of
her
most
expressive
smiles
ah
i
see
through
you
you
are
planning
some
more
pleasant
surprises
for
me
how
happy
we
shall
be
there
as
for
that
rich
uncle
of
yours
if
you
will
only
let
me
see
him
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
him
love
me
and
perhaps
i
shall
succeed
it
would
be
wonderful
if
you
did
not
you
charming
enchantress
responded
he
he
folded
her
closely
and
looked
into
the
depths
of
her
beautiful
eyes
with
intensity
not
unmingled
with
sadness
a
moment
after
he
was
waving
his
hat
from
the
shrubbery
and
so
he
passed
away
out
of
her
sight
his
sudden
reappearance
his
lavish
fondness
his
quick
departure
and
the
strange
earnestness
of
his
farewell
look
were
remembered
like
the
flitting
visions
of
a
dream
chapter
xi
in
less
than
three
weeks
after
that
tender
parting
an
elegant
barouche
stopped
in
front
of
magnolia
lawn
and
fitzgerald
assisted
a
very
pretty
blonde
young
lady
to
alight
from
it
as
she
entered
the
parlor
wavering
gleams
of
sunset
lighted
up
the
paper
softened
by
from
the
windows
the
lady
glanced
round
the
apartment
with
a
happy
smile
and
turning
to
the
window
said
what
a
beautiful
lawn
what
superb
trees
does
it
equal
your
expectations
dear
he
asked
you
had
formed
such
romantic
ideas
of
the
place
i
feared
you
might
be
disappointed
i
suppose
that
was
the
reason
you
tried
to
persuade
me
to
spend
our
honeymoon
in
savannah
rejoined
she
but
we
should
be
so
bored
with
visitors
here
it
seems
like
the
garden
of
eden
when
adam
and
eve
had
it
all
to
themselves
before
the
serpent
went
there
to
make
mischief
i
had
heard
father
and
mother
tell
so
much
about
magnolia
lawn
that
i
was
eager
to
see
it
they
visited
it
in
spring
when
it
really
does
look
like
paradise
replied
he
it
has
its
beauties
now
but
this
is
not
the
favorable
season
for
seeing
it
and
after
we
have
been
here
a
few
days
i
think
we
had
better
return
to
savannah
and
come
again
when
the
lawn
is
carpeted
with
flowers
i
see
your
mind
is
bent
upon
not
staying
here
answered
she
and
i
suppose
it
be
rather
tiresome
to
have
no
other
company
than
your
stupid
little
lily
bell
she
spoke
with
a
pouting
affectation
of
reproach
and
he
exclaimed
lily
darling
as
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
slender
waist
and
putting
aside
a
shower
of
pale
yellowish
ringlets
gazed
fondly
into
the
blue
eyes
that
were
upturned
to
his
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
venus
who
came
to
ask
their
orders
tell
them
to
serve
supper
at
seven
and
then
come
and
show
your
mistress
to
her
he
said
as
she
retired
he
added
now
she
have
something
to
tell
of
she
be
proud
enough
of
being
the
first
to
get
a
full
sight
of
the
new
missis
and
it
a
sight
worth
talking
about
with
a
gratified
smile
she
glanced
at
the
which
reflected
her
graceful
little
figure
and
taking
his
arm
she
walked
slowly
round
the
room
praising
the
tasteful
arrangements
everything
has
such
a
bridal
look
she
said
of
course
replied
he
when
i
have
such
a
fair
lily
bell
for
a
bride
i
wish
to
have
her
bower
pearly
and
but
here
is
venus
come
to
show
you
to
your
i
hope
you
will
like
the
arrangements
up
stairs
also
she
kissed
her
hand
to
him
as
she
left
the
room
and
he
returned
the
salute
when
she
had
gone
he
paced
slowly
up
and
down
for
a
few
moments
as
he
passed
the
piano
he
touched
the
keys
in
a
rambling
way
the
tones
he
brought
out
were
a
few
notes
of
an
air
he
and
rosabella
had
sung
in
that
same
room
a
few
months
before
he
turned
abruptly
from
the
instrument
and
looked
out
from
the
window
in
the
direction
of
the
lonely
cottage
nothing
was
visible
but
trees
and
a
line
of
the
ocean
beyond
but
the
chambers
of
his
soul
were
filled
with
visions
of
rosa
he
thought
of
the
delightful
day
they
had
spent
together
looking
upon
these
same
scenes
of
their
songs
and
caresses
in
the
bower
of
her
letter
so
full
of
love
and
glad
surprise
at
the
bridal
arrangements
she
supposed
he
had
made
for
her
i
really
hope
lily
wo
insist
upon
staying
here
long
thought
he
for
it
is
rather
an
embarrassing
position
for
me
he
seated
himself
at
the
piano
and
swept
his
hand
up
and
down
the
keys
as
if
trying
to
drown
his
thoughts
in
a
tempest
of
sound
but
do
what
he
would
the
thoughts
spoke
loudest
and
after
a
while
he
leaned
his
head
forward
on
the
piano
lost
in
revery
a
soft
little
hand
touched
his
head
and
a
feminine
voice
inquired
what
are
you
thinking
of
gerald
of
you
my
pearl
he
replied
rising
hastily
and
stooping
to
imprint
a
kiss
on
the
forehead
of
his
bride
and
pray
what
were
you
thinking
about
she
asked
that
you
are
the
greatest
beauty
in
the
world
and
that
i
love
you
better
than
man
ever
loved
woman
rejoined
he
and
so
the
game
of
courtship
went
on
till
it
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
supper
when
they
returned
some
time
later
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
candles
lighted
you
have
not
yet
tried
the
piano
said
he
as
he
placed
the
she
seated
herself
and
after
running
up
and
down
the
keys
and
saying
she
liked
the
tone
of
the
instrument
she
began
to
play
and
sing
robin
adair
she
had
a
sweet
thin
voice
and
her
style
of
playing
indicated
rather
one
who
had
learned
music
than
one
whose
soul
lived
in
its
element
fitzgerald
thought
of
the
last
singing
he
had
heard
at
that
piano
and
without
asking
for
another
song
he
began
to
sing
to
her
accompaniment
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
he
had
scarcely
finished
the
line
leave
a
kiss
within
the
cup
and
i
not
ask
for
wine
when
clear
liquid
tones
rose
on
the
air
apparently
from
the
veranda
and
the
words
they
carried
on
their
wings
were
these
down
in
the
meadow
the
clover
i
walked
with
nelly
by
my
side
now
all
those
happy
days
are
over
farewell
my
dark
virginia
bride
nelly
was
a
lady
last
night
she
died
toll
the
bell
for
lovely
nell
my
dark
virginia
bride
the
bride
listened
intensely
her
fingers
resting
lightly
on
the
keys
and
when
the
sounds
died
away
she
started
up
exclaiming
what
a
voice
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
she
moved
eagerly
toward
the
veranda
but
was
suddenly
arrested
by
her
husband
no
no
darling
said
he
you
must
expose
yourself
to
the
night
air
then
do
go
out
yourself
and
bring
her
in
urged
she
i
must
hear
more
of
that
voice
who
is
she
one
of
the
darkies
i
suppose
rejoined
he
you
know
they
all
have
musical
gifts
not
such
gifts
as
that
i
imagine
she
replied
do
go
out
and
bring
her
in
she
was
about
to
draw
the
curtain
aside
to
look
out
when
he
nervously
called
her
attention
to
another
window
see
here
he
exclaimed
my
people
are
gathering
to
welcome
their
new
missis
in
answer
to
request
i
told
him
i
would
introduce
you
to
them
but
you
are
tired
and
i
am
afraid
you
will
take
cold
in
the
evening
air
so
we
will
postpone
the
ceremony
until
o
no
she
replied
i
would
prefer
to
go
now
how
their
black
faces
will
shine
when
they
see
the
glass
beads
and
gay
handkerchiefs
i
have
brought
for
them
besides
i
want
to
find
out
who
that
singer
is
strange
you
do
take
more
interest
in
such
a
voice
as
that
when
you
are
so
full
of
music
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
ring
for
my
shawl
with
a
decision
almost
peremptory
in
its
tone
he
said
no
i
had
rather
you
would
go
out
seeing
that
his
manner
excited
some
surprise
he
patted
her
head
and
added
mind
your
husband
now
a
good
child
amuse
yourself
at
the
piano
while
i
go
out
she
pouted
a
little
but
finished
by
saying
coaxingly
come
back
soon
dear
she
attempted
to
follow
him
far
enough
to
look
out
on
the
veranda
but
he
gently
put
her
back
and
kissing
his
hand
to
her
departed
she
raised
a
corner
of
the
curtain
and
peeped
out
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
his
figure
the
moon
was
rising
and
she
could
see
that
he
walked
slowly
peering
into
spots
of
dense
shadow
or
thickets
of
shrubbery
as
if
looking
for
some
one
but
all
was
motionless
and
still
save
the
sound
of
a
banjo
from
the
group
of
servants
how
i
wish
i
could
hear
that
voice
again
she
thought
to
herself
very
singular
gerald
should
appear
so
indifferent
to
it
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
she
pondered
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
she
tried
to
play
but
not
finding
it
entertaining
without
an
auditor
she
soon
rose
and
drawing
aside
one
of
the
curtains
looked
out
upon
the
lovely
night
the
grand
old
trees
cast
broad
shadows
on
the
lawn
and
the
shrubbery
of
the
garden
gleamed
in
the
soft
moonlight
she
felt
solitary
without
any
one
to
speak
to
and
being
accustomed
to
have
her
whims
gratified
she
was
rather
impatient
under
the
prohibition
laid
upon
her
she
rung
the
bell
and
requested
venus
to
bring
her
shawl
the
obsequious
laid
it
lightly
on
her
shoulders
and
holding
out
a
white
nubia
of
zephyr
worsted
she
said
missis
would
like
to
war
dis
ere
she
stood
watching
while
her
mistress
twined
the
gossamer
fabric
round
her
head
with
careless
grace
she
opened
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
on
the
veranda
and
as
she
looked
after
her
she
muttered
to
herself
she
a
pooty
missis
but
not
such
a
hansom
lady
as
turrer
a
laugh
shone
through
her
dark
face
as
she
added
would
be
curus
ef
she
should
fine
turrer
missis
out
dar
as
she
passed
through
the
parlor
she
glanced
at
the
large
mirror
which
dimly
reflected
her
dusky
charms
and
said
with
a
smile
massa
knows
what
hansome
he
good
judge
ob
we
far
sex
the
remark
was
inaudible
to
the
bride
who
walked
up
and
down
the
veranda
ever
and
anon
glancing
at
the
garden
walks
to
see
if
gerald
were
in
sight
she
had
a
little
plan
of
hiding
among
the
vines
when
she
saw
him
coming
and
peeping
out
suddenly
as
he
approached
she
thought
to
herself
she
should
look
so
pretty
in
the
moonlight
that
he
would
forget
to
chide
her
and
certainly
she
was
a
pleasant
vision
her
fairy
figure
enveloped
in
soft
white
folds
of
muslin
her
delicate
complexion
shaded
by
curls
so
fair
that
they
seemed
a
portion
of
the
fleecy
nubia
were
so
perfectly
in
unison
with
the
mild
radiance
of
the
evening
that
she
seemed
like
an
embodied
portion
of
the
moonlight
gerald
absented
himself
so
long
that
her
little
plan
of
surprising
him
had
time
to
cool
she
paused
more
frequently
in
her
promenade
and
looked
longer
at
the
distant
sparkle
of
the
sea
turning
to
resume
her
walk
after
one
of
these
brief
moments
of
contemplation
she
happened
to
glance
at
the
of
the
veranda
and
through
one
of
its
openings
saw
a
large
dark
eye
watching
her
she
started
to
run
into
the
house
but
upon
second
thought
she
called
out
gerald
you
rogue
why
did
you
speak
to
let
me
know
you
were
there
she
darted
toward
the
lattice
but
the
eye
disappeared
she
tried
to
follow
but
saw
only
a
tall
shadow
gliding
away
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
she
pursued
but
found
only
a
tremulous
reflection
of
vines
in
the
moonlight
she
kept
on
round
the
house
and
into
the
garden
frequently
calling
out
gerald
gerald
hark
hark
she
murmured
to
herself
as
some
tones
of
toll
the
bell
floated
through
the
air
the
ghostly
moonlight
the
strange
lonely
place
and
the
sad
mysterious
sounds
made
her
a
little
afraid
in
a
more
agitated
tone
she
called
gerald
again
in
obedience
to
her
summons
she
saw
him
coming
toward
her
in
the
garden
walk
forgetful
of
her
momentary
fear
she
sprang
toward
him
exclaiming
are
you
a
wizard
how
did
you
get
there
when
two
minutes
ago
you
were
peeping
at
me
through
the
veranda
lattice
i
have
been
there
he
replied
but
why
are
you
out
here
lily
when
i
particularly
requested
you
to
stay
in
the
house
till
i
came
o
you
were
so
long
coming
that
i
grew
tired
of
being
alone
the
moonlight
looked
so
inviting
that
i
went
out
on
the
veranda
to
watch
for
you
and
when
i
saw
you
looking
at
me
through
the
lattice
i
ran
after
you
and
could
find
you
i
have
been
near
the
lattice
he
replied
if
you
saw
somebody
looking
at
you
i
presume
it
was
one
of
the
servants
peeping
at
the
new
missis
none
of
your
tricks
rejoined
she
snapping
her
fingers
at
him
playfully
it
was
eye
that
i
saw
if
it
were
for
making
you
vain
i
would
ask
you
whether
your
handsome
eyes
could
be
mistaken
for
the
eyes
of
one
of
your
negroes
but
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
to
that
bower
down
there
not
dearest
said
he
i
will
go
with
you
now
is
just
the
time
persisted
she
bowers
never
look
so
pretty
as
by
moonlight
i
do
think
you
are
very
gallant
to
your
bride
to
refuse
her
such
a
little
favor
thus
urged
he
yielded
though
reluctantly
to
her
whim
as
she
entered
the
bower
and
turned
to
speak
to
him
the
moonlight
fell
full
upon
her
figure
what
a
pretty
little
witch
you
are
he
exclaimed
my
lily
bell
my
precious
pearl
my
sylph
you
look
like
a
spirit
just
floated
down
from
the
moon
all
moonshine
replied
she
with
a
smile
he
kissed
the
saucy
lips
and
the
vines
which
had
witnessed
other
caresses
in
that
same
bower
a
few
months
earlier
whispered
to
each
other
but
told
no
tales
she
leaned
her
head
upon
his
bosom
and
looking
out
upon
the
winding
walks
of
the
garden
so
fair
and
peaceful
in
sheen
and
shadow
she
said
that
her
new
home
was
more
beautiful
than
she
had
dreamed
hark
said
she
raising
her
head
suddenly
and
listening
i
thought
i
heard
a
sigh
it
was
only
the
wind
among
the
vines
he
replied
wandering
about
in
the
moonlight
has
made
you
nervous
i
believe
i
a
little
afraid
before
you
came
said
she
that
eye
looking
at
me
through
the
lattice
gave
me
a
start
and
while
i
was
running
after
your
shadow
i
heard
that
voice
again
singing
the
bell
i
wonder
how
you
can
be
so
indifferent
about
such
a
remarkable
voice
when
you
are
such
a
lover
of
music
i
presume
as
i
told
you
before
that
it
was
one
of
the
darkies
rejoined
he
i
will
inquire
about
it
i
should
sooner
believe
it
to
be
the
voice
of
an
angel
from
heaven
than
a
darky
responded
the
bride
i
wish
i
could
hear
it
again
before
i
sleep
in
immediate
response
to
her
wish
the
full
rich
voice
she
had
invoked
began
to
sing
an
air
from
norma
beginning
o
how
his
art
deceived
thee
fitzgerald
started
so
suddenly
he
overturned
a
seat
near
them
hush
she
whispered
clinging
to
his
arm
thus
they
stood
in
silence
she
listening
with
rapt
attention
he
embarrassed
and
angry
almost
beyond
endurance
the
enchanting
sounds
were
obviously
receding
let
us
follow
her
and
settle
the
question
who
she
is
said
lily
trying
to
pull
him
forward
but
he
held
her
back
strongly
no
more
running
about
he
answered
almost
sternly
then
immediately
checking
himself
he
added
in
a
gentler
tone
it
is
imprudent
in
you
to
be
out
so
long
in
the
evening
air
and
i
am
really
very
tired
dear
lily
i
will
try
to
ascertain
which
of
the
servants
has
been
following
you
round
in
this
strange
way
do
you
suppose
any
servant
could
sing
she
exclaimed
they
are
nearly
all
musical
and
wonderfully
imitative
answered
he
they
can
catch
almost
anything
they
hear
he
spoke
in
a
nonchalant
tone
but
she
felt
his
arm
tremble
as
she
leaned
upon
it
he
had
never
before
made
such
an
effort
to
repress
rage
in
tones
of
tender
anxiety
she
said
i
am
afraid
you
are
very
tired
dear
i
am
sorry
i
kept
you
out
so
long
i
am
rather
weary
he
replied
taking
her
hand
and
holding
it
in
his
he
was
so
silent
as
they
walked
toward
the
house
that
she
feared
he
was
seriously
offended
with
her
as
they
entered
the
parlor
she
said
i
did
think
you
cared
about
my
not
going
out
gerald
except
on
account
of
my
taking
cold
and
with
my
shawl
and
nubia
i
do
think
there
was
the
least
danger
of
that
it
was
such
a
beautiful
night
i
wanted
to
go
out
to
meet
you
dear
he
kissed
her
mechanically
and
replied
i
am
not
offended
darling
then
if
the
blue
devils
possess
you
we
will
try
saul
method
of
driving
them
away
said
she
she
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
accompany
her
with
voice
or
flute
he
tried
the
flute
but
played
with
such
uncertainty
that
she
looked
at
him
with
surprise
music
was
the
worst
remedy
she
could
have
tried
to
quiet
the
disturbance
in
his
soul
for
its
voice
evoked
ghosts
of
the
past
i
am
really
tired
lily
said
he
and
affecting
a
drowsiness
he
did
not
feel
he
proposed
retiring
for
the
night
the
chamber
was
beautiful
with
the
moon
shining
through
its
drapery
and
the
murmur
of
the
ocean
was
a
soothing
lullaby
but
it
was
long
before
either
of
them
slept
and
when
they
slumbered
the
same
voice
went
singing
through
their
dreams
he
was
in
the
flowery
parlor
at
new
orleans
listening
to
the
light
of
other
days
and
she
was
following
a
veiled
shadow
through
a
strange
garden
hearing
the
intermingled
tones
of
norma
and
toll
the
bell
it
was
late
in
the
morning
when
she
awoke
gerald
was
gone
but
a
bouquet
of
fragrant
flowers
lay
on
the
pillow
beside
her
her
was
on
a
chair
by
the
bedside
and
venus
sat
at
the
window
sewing
where
is
mr
fitzgerald
she
inquired
he
said
he
war
gwine
to
turrer
plantation
on
business
he
leff
dem
flower
dar
an
tole
me
to
say
he
come
back
soon
the
fair
hair
was
neatly
arranged
by
the
black
hands
that
contrasted
so
strongly
with
it
the
genteel
little
figure
was
enveloped
in
a
of
delicate
blue
and
white
french
cambric
and
the
little
feet
were
ensconced
in
slippers
of
azure
velvet
embroidered
with
silver
the
dainty
breakfast
served
on
french
porcelain
was
slowly
eaten
and
still
gerald
returned
not
she
removed
to
the
chamber
window
and
leaning
her
cheek
on
her
hand
looked
out
upon
the
of
the
ocean
her
morning
thought
was
the
same
with
which
she
had
passed
into
slumber
the
previous
night
how
strange
it
was
that
gerald
would
take
no
notice
of
that
enchanting
voice
the
incident
that
seemed
to
her
a
charming
novelty
had
she
knew
not
why
cast
a
shadow
over
the
first
evening
in
their
bridal
home
chapter
xii
fitzgerald
had
ordered
his
horse
to
be
saddled
at
an
earlier
hour
than
tom
had
ever
known
him
to
ride
except
on
a
hunting
excursion
and
in
his
own
mind
he
concluded
that
his
master
would
be
asleep
at
the
hour
he
had
indicated
before
he
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
for
the
night
he
expressed
this
opinion
to
the
cook
by
saying
yer
know
dinah
white
folks
is
allers
mighty
wide
awake
de
night
afore

gits
up
to
his
surprise
however
fitzgerald
made
his
appearance
at
the
stable
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
comb
the
horse
you
lazy
black
rascal
he
exclaimed
did
i
order
you
to
have
the
horse
ready
by
this
time
yes
massa
replied
tom
sheering
out
of
the

of
the
upraised
whip
but
it
peers
like

dis

the
horse
was
speedily

and
tom
looked
after
his
master
as
he
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
dashed
off
in
the
direction
of
the
lonely
cottage
there
was
a
grin
on
his
face
as
he
muttered
reckon
missis
do
know

he
walked
toward
the
house
whistling

replied
tom
fitzgerald
had
no
sense
of
refreshment
in
his
morning
ride
he
urged
his
horse
along
impatiently
with
brow
contracted
and
lips
firmly
compressed
he
was
rehearsing
in
his
mind
the
severe
reprimand
he
intended
to
bestow
upon
rosa
he
expected
to
be
met
with
tears
and
reproaches
to
which
he
would
show
himself
hard
till
she
made
contrite
apologies
for
her
most
unexpected
and
provoking
proceedings
it
was
his
purpose
to
pardon
her
at
last
for
he
was
far
enough
from
wishing
to
lose
her
and
she
had
always
been
so
gentle
and
submissive
that
he
entertained
no
doubt
the
scene
would
end
with
a
loving
willingness
to
accept
his
explanations
and
believe
in
his
renewed
professions
she
loves
me
to
distraction
and
she
is
entirely
in
my
power
thought
he
it
will
be
strange
indeed
if
i
can
not
mould
her
as
i
will
arrived
at
the
cottage
he
found
tulee
washing
on
a
bench
outside
the
kitchen
good
morning
tulee
said
he
is
your
mistress
up
yet
missy
rosy
been
asleep
she
answered
in
a
very
cold
tone
without
looking
up
from
her
work
he
entered
the
house
and
softly
opened
the
door
of
rosa
sleeping
apartment
she
was
walking
slowly
with
arms
crossed
looking
downward
as
if
plunged
in
thought
her
extreme
pallor
disarmed
him
and
there
was
no
hardness
in
his
tone
when
he
said
rosabella
she
started
for
she
had
supposed
the
intruder
was
tulee
with
head
proudly
erect
nostrils
dilated
and
eyes
that
flashed
fire
she
exclaimed
how
dare
you
come
here
this
reception
was
so
entirely
unexpected
that
it
disconcerted
him
and
instead
of
the
severe
reproof
he
had
contemplated
he
said
in
an
expostulating
tone
rosa
i
always
thought
you
the
soul
of
honor
when
we
parted
you
promised
not
to
go
to
the
plantation
unless
i
was
with
you
is
this
the
way
you
keep
your
word
talk
of
honor
and
promises
she
exclaimed
the
sneer
conveyed
in
the
tones
stung
him
to
the
quick
but
he
made
an
effort
to
conceal
his
chagrin
and
said
with
apparent
calmness
you
must
admit
it
was
an
unaccountable
freak
to
start
for
the
plantation
in
the
evening
and
go
wandering
round
the
grounds
in
that
mysterious
way
what
could
have
induced
you
to
take
such
a
step
i
accidentally
overheard
tom
telling
tulee
that
you
were
to
bring
home
a
bride
from
the
north
yesterday
i
could
not
believe
it
of
you
and
i
was
too
proud
to
question
him
but
after
reflecting
upon
it
i
chose
to
go
and
see
for
myself
and
when
i
seen
for
myself
i
wished
to
remind
you
of
that
past
which
you
seemed
to
have
forgotten
curse
on
tom
he
exclaimed
he
shall
smart
for
this
mischief
do
be
so
unmanly
as
to
punish
a
poor
servant
for
mentioning
a
piece
of
news
that
interested
the
whole
plantation
and
which
must
of
course
be
a
matter
of
notoriety
she
replied
very
quietly
both
he
and
tulee
were
delicate
enough
to
conceal
it
from
me
fitzgerald
felt
embarrassed
by
her
perfect
after
a
slight
pause
during
which
she
kept
her
face
averted
from
him
he
said
i
confess
that
appearances
are
against
me
and
that
you
have
reason
to
feel
offended
but
if
you
knew
just
how
i
was
situated
you
would
perhaps
judge
me
less
harshly
i
have
met
with
heavy
losses
lately
and
i
was
in
danger
of
becoming
bankrupt
unless
i
could
keep
up
my
credit
by
a
wealthy
marriage
the
father
of
this
young
lady
is
rich
and
she
fell
in
love
with
me
i
have
married
her
but
i
tell
you
truly
dear
rosa
that
i
love
you
more
than
i
ever
loved
any
other
woman
you
say
she
loved
you
and
yet
you
could
deceive
her
so
she
replied
you
could
conceal
from
her
that
you
already
had
a
wife
when
i
watched
her
as
she
walked
on
the
veranda
i
was
tempted
to
reveal
myself
and
disclose
your
baseness
fitzgerald
eyes
flashed
with
sudden
anger
as
he
vociferated
rosa
if
you
ever
dare
to
set
up
any
such
claim
if
i
she
exclaimed
interrupting
him
in
a
tone
of
proud
defiance
that
thrilled
through
all
his
nerves
alarmed
by
the
strength
of
character
which
he
had
never
dreamed
she
possessed
he
said
in
your
present
state
of
mind
there
is
no
telling
what
you
may
dare
to
do
it
becomes
necessary
for
you
to
understand
your
true
position
you
are
not
my
wife
the
man
who
married
us
had
no
legal
authority
to
perform
the
ceremony
o
steeped
in
falsehood
to
the
lips
exclaimed
she
and
are
the
idol
i
have
worshipped
he
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
not
unmingled
with
admiration
rosa
i
could
not
have
believed
you
had
such
a
temper
rejoined
he
but
why
will
you
persist
in
making
yourself
and
me
unhappy
as
long
as
my
wife
is
ignorant
of
my
love
for
you
no
harm
is
done
if
you
would
only
listen
to
reason
we
might
still
be
happy
i
could
manage
to
visit
you
often
you
would
find
me
as
affectionate
as
ever
and
i
will
provide
amply
for
you
for
me
she
repeated
slowly
looking
him
calmly
and
loftily
in
the
face
what
have
you
ever
seen
in
me
fitzgerald
that
has
led
you
to
suppose
i
would
consent
to
sell
myself
his
susceptible
temperament
could
not
withstand
the
regal
beauty
of
her
proud
attitude
and
indignant
look
o
rosa
said
he
there
is
no
woman
on
earth
to
be
compared
with
you
if
you
only
knew
how
i
idolize
you
at
this
moment
after
all
the
cruel
words
you
have
uttered
you
surely
would
relent
why
will
you
not
be
reasonable
dearest
why
not
consent
to
live
with
me
as
your
mother
lived
with
your
father
do
wrong
the
memory
of
my
mother
responded
she
hastily
she
was
too
pure
and
noble
to
be
dishonored
by
your
cruel
laws
she
would
never
have
entered
into
any
such
base
and
degrading
arrangement
as
you
propose
she
could
have
lived
under
the
perpetual
shame
of
deceiving
another
wife
she
could
have
loved
my
father
if
he
had
deceived
her
as
you
have
deceived
me
she
trusted
him
entirely
and
in
return
he
gave
her
his
undivided
affection
and
i
give
you
undivided
affection
he
replied
by
all
the
stars
of
heaven
i
swear
that
you
are
now
as
you
always
have
been
my
rosa
regina
my
rosa
do
not
exhaust
your
oaths
rejoined
she
with
a
contemptuous
curl
of
the
lip
keep
some
of
them
for
your
lily
bell
your
precious
pearl
your
moonlight
sylph
thinking
the
retort
implied
a
shade
of
jealousy
he
felt
encouraged
to
persevere
you
may
thank
your
own
imprudence
for
having
overheard
words
so
offensive
to
you
responded
he
but
rosa
dearest
you
can
not
with
all
your
efforts
drive
from
you
the
pleasant
memories
of
our
love
you
surely
do
not
hate
me
no
fitzgerald
you
have
fallen
below
hatred
i
despise
you
his
brow
contracted
and
his
lips
tightened
i
can
not
endure
this
treatment
said
he
in
tones
of
suppressed
rage
you
tempt
me
too
far
you
compel
me
to
humble
your
pride
since
i
can
not
persuade
you
to
listen
to
expostulations
and
entreaties
i
must
inform
you
that
my
power
over
you
is
complete
you
are
my
slave
i
bought
you
of
your
father
creditors
before
i
went
to
nassau
i
can
sell
you
any
day
i
choose
and
by
jove
i
will
if
the
sudden
change
that
came
over
her
arrested
him
she
pressed
one
hand
hard
upon
her
heart
and
gasped
for
breath
he
sank
at
once
on
his
knees
crying
o
forgive
me
rosa
i
was
beside
myself
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
hearing
him
and
seeing
her
reel
backward
into
a
chair
with
pale
lips
and
closing
eyes
he
hastened
to
summon
tulee
such
remorse
came
over
him
that
he
longed
to
wait
for
her
returning
consciousness
but
he
remembered
that
his
long
absence
must
excite
surprise
in
the
mind
of
his
bride
and
might
perhaps
connect
itself
with
the
mysterious
singer
of
the
preceding
evening
goaded
by
contending
feelings
he
hurried
through
the
footpaths
whence
he
had
so
often
kissed
his
hand
to
rosa
in
fond
farewell
and
hastily
mounted
his
horse
without
one
backward
glance
before
he
came
in
sight
of
the
plantation
the
perturbation
of
his
mind
had
subsided
and
he
began
to
think
himself
a
individual
plague
on
the
caprices
of
women
thought
he
all
this
comes
of
lily
taking
the
silly
romantic
whim
of
coming
here
to
spend
the
honeymoon
and
rosa
foolish
girl
what
airs
she
assumes
i
wanted
to
deal
generously
by
her
but
she
rejected
all
my
offers
as
haughtily
as
if
she
had
been
queen
of
spain
and
all
the
americas
there
a
devilish
deal
more
of
the
spanish
blood
in
her
than
i
thought
for
pride
becomes
her
wonderfully
but
it
wo
hold
out
forever
she
find
that
she
ca
live
without
me
i
can
wait
feeling
the
need
of
some
to
let
off
his
vexation
he
selected
poor
tom
for
that
purpose
when
the
obsequious
servant
came
to
lead
away
the
horse
his
master
gave
him
a
sharp
cut
of
the
whip
saying
i
teach
you
to
tell
tales
again
you
black
rascal
but
having
a
dainty
aversion
to
the
sight
of
pain
he
summoned
the
overseer
and
consigned
him
to
his
tender
mercies
chapter
xiii
if
flora
could
have
known
all
this
the
sisters
would
have
soon
been
locked
in
each
other
arms
but
while
she
supposed
that
rosa
still
regarded
fitzgerald
with
perfect
love
and
confidence
no
explanation
of
her
flight
could
be
given
she
did
indeed
need
to
be
often
reminded
by
delano
that
it
would
be
the
most
unkind
thing
toward
her
sister
as
well
as
hazardous
to
herself
to
attempt
any
communication
notwithstanding
the
tenderest
care
for
her
comfort
and
happiness
she
could
not
help
being
sometimes
oppressed
with
homesickness
her
boston
home
was
tasteful
and
elegant
but
everything
seemed
foreign
and
strange
she
longed
for
rosa
and
tulee
and
madame
and
the
signor
she
missed
what
she
called
the
phrases
to
which
she
had
always
been
accustomed
and
in
her
desire
to
behave
with
propriety
there
was
an
unwonted
sense
of
constraint
when
callers
came
she
felt
like
a
colt
making
its
first
acquaintance
with
harness
she
endeavored
to
conceal
such
feelings
from
her
kind
benefactress
but
sometimes
if
she
was
surprised
in
tears
she
would
say
apologetically
i
love
you
dearly
mamita
lila
but
it
is
dreadful
to
be
so
far
away
from
anybody
that
ever
knew
anything
about
the
old
times
but
you
forget
that
i
do
know
something
about
them
darling
replied
delano
i
am
never
so
happy
as
when
you
are
telling
me
about
your
father
perhaps
by
and
by
when
you
have
become
enough
used
to
your
new
home
to
feel
as
mischievous
as
you
are
prone
to
be
you
will
take
a
fancy
to
sing
to
me
there
nothing
half
so
sweet
in
life
as
love
dream
it
was
beautiful
to
see
how
girlish
the
sensible
and
serious
lady
became
in
her
efforts
to
be
companionable
to
her
young
day
after
day
her
intimate
friends
found
her
playing
battledoor
or
the
graces
or
practising
pretty
french
romanzas
flowery
rondeaux
or
lively
dances
she
was
surprised
at
herself
for
she
had
not
supposed
it
possible
for
her
ever
to
take
an
interest
in
such
things
after
her
daughter
died
but
like
all
going
out
of
self
these
efforts
brought
their
recompense
she
always
introduced
the
little
stranger
as
miss
flora
delano
my
adopted
daughter
to
those
who
were
curious
to
inquire
further
she
said
she
is
an
orphan
in
whom
i
became
much
interested
in
the
west
indies
as
we
were
both
very
much
alone
in
the
world
i
thought
the
wisest
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
cheer
each
other
loneliness
no
allusion
was
ever
made
to
her
former
name
for
that
might
have
led
to
inconvenient
questions
concerning
her
father
marriage
and
moreover
the
lady
had
no
wish
to
resuscitate
the
little
piece
of
romance
in
her
own
private
history
now
remembered
by
few
it
was
contrary
to
delano
usual
caution
and
deliberation
to
adopt
a
stranger
so
hastily
and
had
she
been
questioned
beforehand
she
would
have
pronounced
it
impossible
for
her
to
enter
into
such
a
relation
with
one
allied
to
the
colored
race
and
herself
a
slave
but
a
strange
combination
of
circumstances
had
all
at
once
placed
her
in
this
most
unexpected
position
she
never
for
one
moment
regretted
the
step
she
had
taken
but
the
consciousness
of
having
a
secret
to
conceal
especially
a
secret
at
war
with
the
conventional
rules
of
society
was
distasteful
to
her
and
felt
as
some
diminution
of
dignity
she
did
not
believe
in
the
genuineness
of
rosa
marriage
though
she
deemed
it
best
not
to
impart
such
doubts
to
flora
if
fitzgerald
should
marry
another
she
foresaw
that
it
would
be
her
duty
to
assist
in
the
reunion
of
the
sisters
both
of
whom
were
slaves
she
often
thought
to
herself
in
what
a
singular
complication
i
have
become
involved
so
strange
for
me
who
have
such
an
aversion
to
all
sorts
of
intrigues
and
mysteries
with
these
reflections
were
mingled
anxieties
concerning
flora
future
of
course
it
would
not
be
well
for
her
to
be
deprived
of
youthful
companionship
and
if
she
mixed
with
society
her
handsome
person
her
musical
talent
and
her
graceful
dancing
would
be
sure
to
attract
admirers
and
then
would
it
be
right
to
conceal
her
antecedents
and
if
they
should
be
explained
or
accidentally
discovered
after
her
young
affections
were
engaged
what
disappointment
and
sadness
might
follow
but
flora
future
was
in
a
fair
way
to
take
care
of
itself
one
day
she
came
flying
into
the
parlor
with
her
face
all
aglow
o
mamita
lila
exclaimed
she
i
have
had
such
a
pleasant
surprise
i
went
to
goldwin
store
to
do
your
errand
and
who
should
i
find
there
but
florimond
blumenthal
and
pray
who
is
florimond
blumenthal
inquired
delano
o
have
i
told
you
i
thought
i
had
told
you
all
about
everybody
and
everything
he
was
a
poor
orphan
that
papa
took
for
an
he
sent
him
to
school
and
afterward
he
was
his
clerk
he
came
to
our
house
often
when
i
was
a
little
girl
but
after
he
grew
tall
papa
used
to
send
an
old
negro
man
to
do
our
errands
so
i
did
see
him
any
more
till
died
he
was
very
kind
to
us
then
he
was
the
one
that
brought
those
beautiful
baskets
i
told
you
of
is
it
funny
they
drove
him
away
from
new
orleans
because
they
said
he
was
an
abolitionist
and
that
he
helped
us
to
escape
when
he
did
know
anything
at
all
about
it
he
said
he
heard
we
had
gone
to
the
north
and
he
went
looking
all
round
in
new
york
and
then
he
came
to
boston
hoping
to
see
us
or
hear
from
us
some
day
but
he
had
about
done
expecting
it
when
i
walked
into
the
store
you
never
saw
anybody
so
red
as
he
was
when
he
held
out
his
hand
and
said
in
such
a
surprised
way
royal
is
it
you
just
out
of
mischief
i
told
him
very
demurely
that
my
name
was
delano
then
he
became
very
formal
all
at
once
and
said
this
silk
suit
you
mrs
delano
that
made
me
laugh
and
blush
too
i
told
him
i
was
married
but
a
kind
lady
in
summer
street
had
adopted
me
and
given
me
her
name
some
other
customers
came
up
to
the
counter
and
so
i
had
to
come
away
did
you
ask
him
not
to
mention
your
former
name
inquired
delano
no
i
had
time
to
think
of
that
replied
flora
but
i
ask
him
do
go
to
the
store
on
purpose
to
see
him
dear
young
ladies
should
be
careful
about
such
things
suggested
her
maternal
friend
two
hours
afterward
as
they
returned
from
a
flora
had
just
drawn
off
her
gloves
when
she
began
to
rap
on
the
window
and
instantly
darted
into
the
street
delano
looking
out
saw
her
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
young
gentleman
when
she
returned
she
said
to
her
you
should
rap
on
the
windows
to
young
gentlemen
my
child
it
has
a
good
appearance
i
did
rap
to
young
gentlemen
replied
flora
it
was
only
florimond
i
wanted
to
tell
him
not
to
mention
my
name
he
asked
me
about
my
sister
and
i
told
him
she
was
alive
and
well
and
i
tell
him
any
more
at
present
florimond
wo
mention
anything
i
request
him
not
to
i
know
he
wo
delano
smiled
to
herself
at
flora
quick
way
of
doing
things
but
after
all
thought
she
it
is
perhaps
better
settled
so
than
it
would
have
been
with
more
ceremony
then
speaking
aloud
she
said
your
friend
has
a
very
blooming
name
his
name
was
franz
rejoined
flora
but
mamita
called
him
florimond
because
he
had
such
pink
cheeks
and
he
liked
mamita
so
much
that
he
always
writes
his
name
franz
florimond
we
always
had
so
many
flowery
names
mixed
up
with
our
talk
name
is
flowery
too
i
used
to
say
mamita
would
have
called
you
lady
viola
but
violet
colors
and
lilac
colors
are
cousins
and
they
both
suit
your
complexion
and
your
name
mamita
lila
after
dinner
she
began
to
play
and
sing
with
more
gayety
than
she
had
manifested
for
many
a
day
while
her
friend
played
she
practised
several
new
dances
with
great
spirit
and
after
she
had
kissed
she
went
twirling
through
the
door
as
if
music
were
handing
her
out
delano
sat
awhile
in
revery
she
was
thinking
what
a
splendid
marriage
her
adopted
daughter
might
make
if
it
were
not
for
that
stain
upon
her
birth
she
was
checked
by
the
thought
how
i
have
fallen
into
the
world
ways
which
seemed
to
me
so
mean
and
heartless
when
i
was
young
was
happy
in
the
splendid
marriage
they
made
for
from
what
flora
lets
out
occasionally
i
judge
her
father
felt
painfully
the
anomalous
position
of
his
handsome
daughters
alas
if
i
had
not
been
so
weak
as
to
give
him
up
all
this
miserable
entanglement
might
have
been
prevented
so
one
wrong
produces
another
wrong
and
thus
frightfully
may
we
affect
the
destiny
of
others
while
blindly
following
the
lead
of
selfishness
but
the
past
with
all
its
weaknesses
and
sins
has
gone
beyond
recall
and
i
must
try
to
write
a
better
record
on
the
present
as
she
passed
to
her
she
softly
entered
the
adjoining
chamber
and
shading
the
lamp
with
her
hand
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
flora
though
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
since
she
was
darting
round
like
a
she
was
now
sleeping
as
sweetly
as
a
babe
she
made
an
extremely
pretty
picture
in
her
slumber
with
the
long
dark
eyelashes
resting
on
her
youthful
cheek
and
a
shower
of
dark
curls
falling
over
her
arm
no
wonder
alfred
loved
her
so
dearly
thought
she
if
his
spirit
can
see
us
he
must
bless
me
for
saving
his
innocent
child
filled
with
this
solemn
and
tender
thought
she
knelt
by
the
bedside
and
prayed
for
blessing
and
guidance
in
the
task
she
had
undertaken
the
unexpected
finding
of
a
link
connected
with
old
times
had
a
salutary
effect
on
flora
spirits
in
the
morning
she
said
that
she
had
had
pleasant
dreams
about
rosabella
and
tulee
and
that
she
mean
to
be
homesick
any
more
it
very
ungrateful
added
she
when
my
dear
good
mamita
lila
does
so
much
to
make
me
happy
to
help
you
keep
your
good
resolution
i
propose
that
we
go
to
the
athenaeum
said
delano
smiling
flora
had
never
been
in
a
gallery
of
paintings
and
she
was
as
much
pleased
as
a
little
child
with
a
new
her
enthusiasm
attracted
attention
and
visitors
smiled
to
see
her
clap
her
hands
and
to
hear
her
little
shouts
of
pleasure
or
of
fun
ladies
said
to
each
other
it
plain
that
this
lively
little
of
delano
has
never
been
much
in
good
society
and
gentlemen
answered
it
is
equally
obvious
that
she
has
never
kept
vulgar
company
delano
nice
ideas
of
conventional
propriety
were
a
little
disturbed
and
she
was
slightly
annoyed
by
the
attention
they
attracted
but
she
said
to
herself
if
i
am
always
checking
the
child
i
shall
spoil
the
naturalness
which
makes
her
so
charming
so
she
quietly
went
on
explaining
the
pictures
and
giving
an
account
of
the
artists
the
next
day
it
rained
and
delano
read
aloud
the
lady
of
the
lake
stopping
now
and
then
to
explain
its
connection
with
scottish
history
or
to
tell
what
scenes
rossini
had
introduced
in
donna
del
which
she
had
heard
performed
in
paris
the
scenes
of
the
opera
were
eagerly
imbibed
but
the
historical
lessons
rolled
off
her
memory
like
water
from
a
duck
back
it
continued
to
rain
and
drizzle
for
three
days
and
flora
who
was
very
atmospheric
began
to
yield
to
the
dismal
influence
of
the
weather
her
watchful
friend
noticed
the
shadow
of
homesickness
coming
over
the
sunlight
of
her
eyes
and
proposed
that
they
should
go
to
a
concert
flora
objected
saying
that
music
would
make
her
think
so
much
of
rosabella
she
was
afraid
she
should
cry
in
public
but
when
the
programme
was
produced
she
saw
nothing
associated
with
her
sister
and
said
i
will
go
if
you
wish
it
mamita
lila
because
i
like
to
do
everything
you
wish
she
felt
very
indifferent
about
going
but
when
wood
came
forward
singing
the
sea
the
sea
the
open
sea
in
tones
so
strong
and
full
that
they
seemed
the
voice
of
the
sea
itself
she
was
half
beside
herself
with
delight
she
kept
time
with
her
head
and
hands
with
a
degree
of
animation
that
made
the
people
round
her
smile
she
quite
unconscious
of
observation
swayed
to
the
music
and
ever
and
anon
nodded
her
approbation
to
a
young
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
concert
very
highly
though
not
to
such
a
degree
as
to
be
oblivious
of
the
audience
delano
was
partly
amused
and
partly
annoyed
she
took
hand
and
by
a
gentle
pressure
now
and
then
sought
to
remind
her
that
they
were
in
public
but
she
understood
it
as
an
indication
of
musical
sympathy
and
went
on
all
the
same
when
they
entered
the
carriage
to
return
home
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
exclaimed
o
mamita
how
i
have
enjoyed
the
concert
i
am
very
glad
of
it
replied
her
friend
i
suppose
that
was
blumenthal
to
whom
you
nodded
several
times
and
who
followed
you
to
the
carriage
but
my
dear
it
is
the
custom
for
young
ladies
to
keep
nodding
to
young
gentlemen
in
public
places
is
it
i
did
think
anything
about
it
rejoined
flora
but
florimond
is
a
gentleman
he
an
old
acquaintance
do
you
find
it
very
tiresome
mamita
to
be
always
remembering
what
is
the
custom
i
sure
shall
never
learn
when
she
went
singing
up
stairs
that
night
delano
smiled
to
herself
as
she
said
what
i
to
do
with
this
mercurial
young
creature
what
an
overturn
she
makes
in
all
my
serious
pursuits
and
quiet
ways
but
there
is
something
singularly
refreshing
about
the
artless
little
darling
warm
weather
was
coming
and
delano
began
to
make
arrangements
for
passing
the
summer
at
newport
but
her
plans
were
suddenly
changed
one
morning
flora
wished
to
purchase
some
colored
crayons
to
finish
a
drawing
she
had
begun
as
she
was
going
out
her
friend
said
to
her
the
sun
shines
so
brightly
you
had
better
wear
your
veil
o
i
been
muffled
up
so
much
i
do
detest
veils
replied
flora
half
laughingly
and
half
impatiently
i
like
to
have
a
whole
world
full
of
air
to
breathe
in
but
if
you
wish
it
mamita
lila
i
will
wear
it
it
seemed
scarcely
ten
minutes
after
when
the
was
rung
with
energy
and
flora
came
in
nervously
agitated
o
mamita
exclaimed
she
i
am
so
glad
you
advised
me
to
wear
a
veil
i
met
fitzgerald
in
this
very
street
i
do
think
he
saw
me
for
my
veil
was
close
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
coming
i
held
my
head
down
he
ca
take
me
here
in
boston
and
carry
me
off
can
he
he
shall
not
carry
you
off
darling
but
you
must
not
go
in
the
street
except
in
the
carriage
with
me
we
will
sit
up
stairs
a
little
away
from
the
windows
and
if
i
read
aloud
you
wo
forget
yourself
and
sing
at
your
embroidery
or
drawing
as
you
are
apt
to
do
it
not
likely
he
will
remain
in
the
city
many
days
and
i
will
try
to
ascertain
his
movements
before
they
had
settled
to
their
occupations
a
ring
at
the
door
made
flora
start
and
quickened
the
pulses
of
her
less
excitable
friend
it
proved
to
be
only
a
box
of
flowers
from
the
country
but
delano
uneasy
in
the
presence
of
an
undefined
danger
the
nature
and
extent
of
which
she
did
not
understand
opened
her
and
wrote
the
following
note
willard
percival
dear
sir
if
you
can
spare
an
hour
this
evening
to
talk
with
me
on
a
subject
of
importance
you
will
greatly
oblige
yours
very
respectfully
lila
delano
a
servant
was
sent
with
the
note
and
directed
to
admit
no
gentleman
during
the
day
or
evening
without
first
bringing
up
his
name
while
they
were
lingering
at
the
the
rang
and
flora
with
a
look
of
alarm
started
to
run
up
stairs
wait
a
moment
till
the
name
is
brought
in
said
her
friend
if
i
admit
the
visitor
i
should
like
to
have
you
follow
me
to
the
parlor
and
remain
there
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
you
can
then
go
to
your
room
and
when
you
are
there
dear
be
careful
not
to
sing
loud
fitzgerald
shall
not
take
you
from
me
but
if
he
were
to
find
out
you
were
here
it
might
give
rise
to
talk
that
would
be
unpleasant
the
servant
announced
willard
percival
and
a
few
moments
afterward
delano
introduced
her
percival
was
too
well
bred
to
stare
but
the
handsome
little
damsel
evidently
surprised
him
he
congratulated
them
both
upon
the
relation
between
them
and
said
he
need
not
wish
the
young
lady
happiness
in
her
new
home
for
he
believed
delano
always
created
an
atmosphere
of
happiness
around
her
after
a
few
moments
of
desultory
conversation
flora
left
the
room
when
she
had
gone
percival
remarked
that
is
a
very
fascinating
young
person
i
thought
she
would
strike
you
agreeably
replied
delano
her
beauty
and
gracefulness
attracted
me
the
first
time
i
saw
her
and
afterward
i
was
still
more
taken
by
her
extremely
manner
she
has
been
brought
up
in
seclusion
as
complete
as
miranda
on
the
enchanted
island
and
there
is
no
resisting
the
charm
of
her
impulsive
naturalness
but
if
you
please
i
will
now
explain
the
note
i
sent
to
you
this
morning
i
heard
some
months
ago
that
you
had
joined
the
society
and
did
you
send
for
me
hoping
to
convert
me
from
the
error
of
my
ways
inquired
he
smiling
on
the
contrary
i
sent
for
you
to
consult
concerning
a
slave
in
whom
i
am
interested
mrs
delano
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
you
may
well
think
it
strange
she
replied
knowing
as
you
do
how
bitterly
both
my
father
and
my
husband
were
opposed
to
the
agitation
and
how
entirely
apart
my
own
life
has
been
from
anything
of
that
sort
but
while
i
was
at
the
south
this
winter
i
heard
of
a
case
which
greatly
interested
my
feelings
a
wealthy
american
merchant
in
new
orleans
became
strongly
attached
to
a
beautiful
quadroon
who
was
both
the
daughter
and
the
slave
of
a
spanish
planter
her
father
became
involved
in
some
pecuniary
trouble
and
sold
his
daughter
to
the
american
merchant
knowing
that
they
were
mutually
attached
her
bondage
was
merely
nominal
for
the
tie
of
affection
remained
constant
between
them
as
long
as
she
lived
and
he
would
have
married
her
if
such
marriages
had
been
legal
in
louisiana
by
some
unaccountable
carelessness
he
neglected
to
manumit
her
she
left
two
handsome
and
accomplished
daughters
who
always
supposed
their
mother
to
be
a
spanish
lady
and
the
wedded
wife
of
their
father
but
he
died
insolvent
and
to
their
great
dismay
they
found
themselves
claimed
as
slaves
under
the
southern
law
that
child
follows
the
condition
of
the
mother
a
southern
gentleman
who
was
in
love
with
the
eldest
married
her
privately
and
smuggled
them
both
away
to
nassau
after
a
while
he
went
there
to
meet
them
having
previously
succeeded
in
buying
them
of
the
creditors
but
his
conduct
toward
the
younger
was
so
base
that
she
absconded
the
question
i
wish
to
ask
of
you
is
whether
if
he
should
find
her
in
the
free
states
he
could
claim
her
as
his
slave
and
have
his
claim
allowed
by
law
not
if
he
sent
them
to
nassau
replied
percival
british
soil
has
the
enviable
distinction
of
making
free
whosoever
touches
it
but
he
afterward
brought
them
back
to
an
island
between
georgia
and
south
carolina
said
delano
the
eldest
proved
a
most
loving
and
faithful
wife
and
to
this
day
has
no
suspicion
of
his
designs
with
regard
to
her
sister
if
he
married
her
before
he
went
to
nassau
the
ceremony
is
not
binding
rejoined
percival
for
no
marriage
with
a
slave
is
legal
in
the
southern
states
i
was
ignorant
of
that
law
said
delano
being
very
little
informed
on
the
subject
of
slavery
but
i
suspected
trickery
of
some
sort
in
the
transaction
because
he
proved
himself
so
unprincipled
with
regard
to
the
sister
and
where
is
the
sister
inquired
percival
i
trust
to
your
honor
as
a
gentleman
to
keep
the
secret
from
every
mortal
answered
delano
you
have
seen
her
this
evening
is
it
possible
he
exclaimed
that
you
mean
to
say
she
is
your
adopted
daughter
i
did
mean
to
say
that
she
replied
i
have
placed
great
confidence
in
you
for
you
can
easily
imagine
it
would
be
extremely
disagreeable
to
me
as
well
as
to
her
to
become
objects
of
public
notoriety
your
confidence
is
a
sacred
deposit
answered
he
i
have
long
been
aware
that
the
most
romantic
stories
in
the
country
have
grown
out
of
the
institution
of
slavery
but
this
seems
stranger
than
fiction
with
all
my
knowledge
of
the
subject
i
find
it
hard
to
realize
that
such
a
young
lady
as
that
has
been
in
danger
of
being
sold
on
the
in
this
republic
it
makes
one
desirous
to
conceal
that
he
is
an
american
my
principal
reason
for
wishing
to
consult
you
said
delano
is
that
fitzgerald
the
purchaser
of
these
girls
is
now
in
the
city
and
flora
met
him
this
morning
luckily
she
was
closely
veiled
and
he
did
not
recognize
her
i
think
it
is
impossible
he
can
have
obtained
any
clew
to
my
connivance
at
her
escape
and
yet
i
feel
a
little
uneasy
i
am
so
ignorant
of
the
laws
on
this
subject
that
i
do
know
what
he
has
the
power
to
do
if
he
discovers
her
can
he
claim
her
here
in
boston
he
could
claim
her
and
bring
her
before
the
united
states
court
replied
percival
but
i
doubt
whether
he
do
it
to
claim
such
a
girl
as
for
a
slave
would
excite
general
sympathy
and
indignation
and
put
too
much
ammunition
into
the
hands
of
us
abolitionists
besides
no
court
in
the
free
states
could
help
deciding
that
if
he
sent
her
to
nassau
she
became
free
if
he
should
discover
her
whereabouts
i
should
wonder
if
attempts
were
made
to
kidnap
her
for
men
of
his
character
are
very
unscrupulous
and
there
are
plenty
of
caitiffs
in
boston
ready
to
do
any
bidding
of
their
southern
masters
if
she
were
conveyed
to
the
south
though
the
courts
to
decide
she
was
free
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
do
it
for
like
achilles
they
scorn
the
idea
that
laws
were
made
for
such
as
they
if
i
were
certain
that
fitzgerald
knew
of
her
being
here
or
that
he
even
suspected
it
said
delano
i
would
at
once
take
measures
to
settle
the
question
by
private
purchase
but
the
presumption
is
that
he
and
the
sister
suppose
flora
to
be
dead
and
her
escape
can
not
be
made
known
without
betraying
the
cause
of
it
flora
has
a
great
dread
of
disturbing
her
sister
happiness
and
she
thinks
that
now
she
is
away
all
will
go
well
another
difficulty
is
that
while
the
unfortunate
lady
believes
herself
to
be
his
lawful
wife
she
is
really
his
slave
and
if
she
should
offend
him
in
any
way
he
could
sell
her
it
troubles
me
that
i
can
not
discover
any
mode
of
ascertaining
whether
he
deserts
her
or
not
he
keeps
her
hidden
in
the
woods
in
that
lonely
island
where
her
existence
is
unknown
except
to
a
few
of
his
negro
slaves
the
only
white
friends
she
seems
to
have
in
the
world
are
her
music
teacher
and
french
teacher
in
new
orleans
fitzgerald
has
impressed
it
upon
their
minds
that
the
creditors
of
her
father
will
prosecute
him
and
challenge
him
if
they
discover
that
he
first
conveyed
the
girls
away
and
then
bought
them
at
reduced
prices
therefore
if
i
should
send
an
agent
to
new
orleans
at
any
time
to
obtain
tidings
of
the
sister
those
cautious
friends
would
doubtless
consider
it
a
trap
of
the
creditors
and
would
be
very
secretive
it
is
a
tangled
skein
to
unravel
rejoined
percival
i
do
not
see
how
anything
can
be
done
for
the
sister
under
present
circumstances
i
feel
undecided
what
course
to
pursue
with
regard
to
my
adopted
daughter
said
delano
entire
seclusion
is
neither
cheerful
nor
salutary
at
her
age
but
her
person
and
manners
attract
attention
and
excite
curiosity
i
am
extremely
desirous
to
keep
her
history
secret
but
i
already
find
it
difficult
to
answer
questions
without
resorting
to
falsehood
which
is
a
practice
exceedingly
abhorrent
to
me
and
a
very
bad
education
for
her
after
this
meeting
with
fitzgerald
i
can
not
take
her
to
any
public
place
without
a
constant
feeling
of
uneasiness
the
fact
is
i
am
so
unused
to
intrigues
and
mysteries
and
i
find
it
so
hard
to
realize
that
a
young
girl
like
her
be
in
such
a
position
that
i
am
bewildered
and
need
time
to
settle
my
thoughts
upon
a
rational
basis
such
a
responsibility
is
so
new
to
you
so
entirely
foreign
to
your
habits
that
it
must
necessarily
be
perplexing
replied
her
visitor
i
would
advise
you
to
go
abroad
for
a
while
percival
and
i
intend
to
sail
for
europe
soon
and
if
you
will
join
us
we
shall
consider
ourselves
fortunate
i
accept
the
offer
thankfully
said
the
lady
it
will
help
me
out
of
a
present
difficulty
in
the
very
way
i
was
wishing
for
when
the
arrangement
was
explained
to
flora
with
a
caution
not
to
go
in
the
streets
or
show
herself
at
the
windows
meanwhile
she
made
no
objection
but
she
showed
her
dimples
with
a
broad
smile
as
she
said
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
fate
mamita
lila
hiding
or
running
away
chapter
xiv
alfred
king
when
summoned
home
to
boston
by
the
illness
of
his
mother
had
by
advice
of
physicians
immediately
accompanied
her
to
the
south
of
france
and
afterward
to
egypt
finding
little
benefit
from
change
of
climate
and
longing
for
familiar
scenes
and
faces
she
urged
her
son
to
return
to
new
england
after
a
brief
sojourn
in
italy
she
was
destined
never
again
to
see
the
home
for
which
she
yearned
the
garment
of
her
soul
was
laid
away
under
a
flowery
mound
in
florence
and
her
son
returned
alone
during
the
two
years
thus
occupied
communication
with
the
united
states
had
been
much
interrupted
and
his
thoughts
had
been
so
absorbed
by
his
dying
mother
that
the
memory
of
that
bright
evening
in
new
orleans
recurred
less
frequently
than
it
would
otherwise
have
done
still
the
veiled
picture
remained
in
his
soul
making
the
beauty
of
all
other
women
seem
dim
as
he
recrossed
the
atlantic
lonely
and
sad
a
radiant
vision
of
those
two
sisters
sometimes
came
before
his
imagination
with
the
distinctness
of
actual
presence
as
he
sat
silently
watching
the
white
streak
of
foam
in
the
wake
of
the
vessel
he
could
see
as
in
a
mirror
all
the
details
of
that
flowery
parlor
he
could
hear
the
continuous
flow
of
the
fountain
in
the
garden
and
the
melodious
tones
of
buena
notte
amato
bene
arrived
in
boston
his
first
inquiry
of
the
merchants
was
whether
they
had
heard
anything
of
royal
he
received
the
news
of
his
death
with
a
whirl
of
emotions
how
he
longed
for
tidings
concerning
the
daughters
but
questions
would
of
course
be
unavailing
since
their
existence
was
entirely
unknown
at
the
north
that
royal
had
died
insolvent
and
his
property
had
been
disposed
of
at
auction
filled
him
with
alarm
it
instantly
occurred
to
him
how
much
power
such
circumstances
would
place
in
the
hands
of
fitzgerald
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
would
he
marry
rosabella
and
he
seemed
to
hear
a
repetition
of
the
light
careless
tones
of
course
not
she
was
a
quadroon
his
uneasiness
was
too
strong
to
be
restrained
and
the
second
day
after
his
arrival
he
started
for
new
orleans
he
found
the
store
of
his
old
friend
occupied
by
strangers
who
could
only
repeat
what
he
had
already
heard
he
rode
out
to
the
house
where
he
had
passed
that
evening
there
all
was
painfully
changed
the
purchasers
had
refurnished
the
house
with
tasteless
gewgaws
and
the
spirit
of
gracefulness
had
vanished
their
unmodulated
voices
grated
on
his
ear
in
contrast
with
the
liquid
softness
of
rosabella
tones
and
the
merry
musical
tinkling
of
floracita
prattle
all
they
could
tell
him
was
that
they
heard
the
quadroons
who
used
to
be
kept
there
by
the
gentleman
that
owned
the
house
had
gone
to
the
north
somewhere
a
pang
shot
through
his
soul
as
he
asked
himself
whether
they
remembered
his
offer
of
assistance
and
had
gone
in
search
of
him
he
turned
and
looked
back
upon
the
house
as
he
had
done
that
farewell
morning
when
he
assured
them
that
he
would
be
a
brother
in
time
of
need
he
could
hardly
believe
that
all
the
life
and
love
and
beauty
which
animated
that
home
had
vanished
into
utter
darkness
it
seemed
stranger
than
the
changes
of
a
dream
very
sad
at
heart
he
returned
to
the
city
and
sought
out
a
merchant
with
whom
his
father
had
been
accustomed
to
transact
business
talbot
said
he
i
have
come
to
new
orleans
to
inquire
concerning
the
affairs
of
the
late
alfred
royal
who
was
a
particular
friend
of
my
father
i
have
been
surprised
to
hear
that
he
died
insolvent
for
i
supposed
him
to
be
wealthy
he
was
generally
so
considered
rejoined
talbot
but
he
was
brought
down
by
successive
failures
and
some
unlucky
investments
as
we
merchants
often
are
you
know
were
you
acquainted
with
him
asked
alfred
i
knew
very
little
of
him
except
in
the
way
of
business
replied
the
merchant
he
was
disinclined
to
society
and
therefore
some
people
considered
him
eccentric
but
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
honorable
man
i
think
he
never
married
said
alfred
in
a
tone
of
hesitating
inquiry
which
he
hoped
might
lead
to
the
subject
he
had
at
heart
but
it
only
elicited
the
brief
reply
he
was
a
bachelor
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
family
not
legitimated
by
law
inquired
the
young
man
there
was
a
rumor
about
his
living
somewhere
out
of
the
city
with
a
handsome
quadroon
answered
the
merchant
but
such
arrangements
are
so
common
here
they
excite
no
curiosity
can
you
think
of
any
one
who
had
intimate
relations
with
him
of
whom
i
could
learn
something
about
that
connection
no
i
can
not
as
i
tell
you
he
never
mixed
with
society
and
people
knew
very
little
about
him
ha
there
a
gentleman
going
by
now
who
may
be
able
to
give
you
some
information
hallo
signor
papanti
the
italian
who
was
thus
hailed
halted
in
his
quick
walk
and
being
beckoned
to
by
talbot
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
store
i
think
you
brought
a
bill
against
the
estate
of
the
late
alfred
royal
for
lessons
given
to
some
quadroon
girls
did
you
not
inquired
the
merchant
having
received
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
he
said
this
is
king
a
young
gentleman
from
the
north
who
wishes
to
obtain
information
on
that
subject
perhaps
you
can
give
it
to
him
i
remember
the
young
gentleman
replied
the
signor
royal
did
introduce
me
to
him
at
his
store
the
two
gentlemen
thus
introduced
bade
talbot
good
morning
and
walked
away
together
when
king
said
my
father
and
royal
were
as
brothers
and
that
is
the
reason
i
feel
interested
to
know
what
has
become
of
his
daughters
the
italian
replied
i
will
tell
sir
because
royal
told
me
you
were
an
excellent
man
and
the
son
of
his
old
friend
rapid
questions
and
answers
soon
brought
out
the
principal
features
of
the
sisters
strange
history
when
it
came
to
the
fact
of
their
being
claimed
as
slaves
king
started
is
such
a
thing
possible
in
this
country
he
exclaimed
girls
so
elegant
and
accomplished
as
they
were
quite
possible
sir
responded
the
signor
i
have
known
several
similar
instances
in
this
city
but
in
this
case
i
was
surprised
because
i
never
knew
their
mother
was
a
slave
she
was
a
singularly
handsome
and
ladylike
woman
how
was
it
possible
that
royal
neglected
to
manumit
her
inquired
the
young
man
i
suppose
he
never
thought
of
her
otherwise
than
as
his
wife
and
never
dreamed
of
being
otherwise
than
rich
rejoined
the
signor
besides
you
know
how
often
death
does
overtake
men
with
their
duties
half
fulfilled
he
did
manumit
his
daughters
a
few
months
before
his
decease
but
it
was
decided
that
he
was
then
too
deeply
in
debt
to
have
a
right
to
dispose
of
any
portion
of
his
property
property
echoed
the
indignant
young
man
such
a
term
applied
to
women
makes
me
an
abolitionist
please
not
to
speak
that
word
aloud
responded
the
italian
i
was
in
prison
several
weeks
on
the
charge
of
helping
off
those
interesting
pupils
of
mine
and
i
do
know
what
might
have
become
of
me
if
fitzgerald
had
not
helped
me
by
money
and
influence
i
have
my
own
opinions
about
slavery
but
i
had
rather
go
out
of
new
orleans
before
i
express
them
a
free
country
indeed
exclaimed
the
young
man
where
one
can
not
safely
express
his
indignation
against
such
enormities
but
tell
me
how
the
girls
were
rescued
from
such
a
dreadful
fate
for
by
the
assurance
you
gave
me
at
the
outset
that
they
needed
no
assistance
i
infer
that
they
were
rescued
he
listened
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
to
the
account
of
fitzgerald
agency
in
their
escape
his
marriage
rosabella
devoted
love
for
him
and
her
happy
home
on
a
paradisian
island
the
signor
summed
it
up
by
saying
i
believe
her
happiness
has
been
entirely
without
alloy
except
the
sad
fate
of
her
sister
of
which
we
heard
a
few
weeks
ago
what
has
happened
to
her
inquired
alfred
with
eager
interest
she
went
to
the
to
gather
mosses
and
never
returned
replied
the
signor
it
is
supposed
she
slipped
into
the
water
and
was
drowned
or
that
she
was
seized
by
an
alligator
o
horrid
exclaimed
alfred
poor
floracita
what
a
bright
beaming
little
beauty
she
was
but
an
alligator
mouth
was
a
better
fate
than
slavery
again
touching
upon
the
dangerous
topic
rejoined
the
signor
if
you
stay
here
long
i
think
you
and
the
will
become
acquainted
but
here
is
what
used
to
be
poor
royal
happy
home
and
yonder
is
where
madame
papanti
resides
the
madame
guirlande
i
told
you
of
who
befriended
the
poor
orphans
when
they
had
no
other
friend
her
kindness
to
them
and
her
courage
in
managing
for
them
was
what
first
put
it
in
my
head
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
come
in
and
have
a
with
her
sir
she
knew
the
girls
from
the
time
they
were
born
and
she
loved
them
like
a
mother
within
the
house
the
young
man
listened
to
a
more
prolonged
account
some
of
the
details
of
which
were
new
others
a
repetition
madame
dwelt
with
evident
satisfaction
on
the
fact
that
rosa
in
the
midst
of
all
her
peril
refused
to
accept
the
protection
of
fitzgerald
unless
she
were
married
to
him
because
she
had
so
promised
her
father
the
night
before
he
died
that
was
highly
honorable
to
her
replied
king
but
marriage
with
a
slave
is
not
valid
in
law
so
the
signor
says
rejoined
madame
i
was
so
frightened
and
hurried
and
i
was
so
relieved
when
a
protector
offered
himself
that
i
did
think
to
inquire
anything
about
it
before
fitzgerald
made
his
appearance
we
had
planned
to
go
to
boston
in
search
of
you
of
he
exclaimed
eagerly
o
how
i
wish
you
had
and
that
i
had
been
in
boston
to
receive
you
well
i
do
know
that
anything
better
could
be
done
than
has
been
done
responded
madame
the
girls
were
handsome
to
the
perdition
of
their
souls
as
we
say
in
france
and
they
knew
no
more
about
the
world
than
two
blind
kittens
their
mother
came
here
a
stranger
and
she
made
no
acquaintance
thus
they
seemed
to
be
left
singularly
alone
when
their
parents
were
gone
fitzgerald
was
so
desperately
in
love
with
rosabella
and
she
with
him
that
they
could
not
have
been
kept
long
apart
any
way
he
has
behaved
very
generously
toward
them
by
purchasing
them
he
has
taken
them
out
of
the
power
of
the
creditors
some
of
whom
were
very
bad
men
he
bought
rosa
piano
and
several
other
articles
to
which
they
were
attached
on
their
and
mother
account
and
conveyed
them
privately
to
the
new
home
he
had
provided
for
them
rosabella
always
writes
of
him
as
the
most
devoted
of
husbands
and
dear
little
floracita
used
to
mention
him
as
the
kindest
of
brothers
so
there
seems
every
reason
to
suppose
that
rosa
will
be
as
fortunate
as
her
mother
was
i
hope
so
replied
king
but
i
know
royal
had
very
little
confidence
in
fitzgerald
and
the
brief
acquaintance
i
had
with
him
impressed
me
with
the
idea
that
he
was
a
heartless
insidious
man
moreover
they
are
his
slaves
they
do
know
that
rejoined
madame
he
has
had
the
delicacy
to
conceal
it
from
them
it
would
have
been
more
delicate
to
have
recorded
their
manumission
responded
king
that
would
necessarily
involve
change
of
residence
remarked
the
signor
for
the
laws
of
georgia
forbid
the
manumission
of
slaves
within
the
state
what
blasphemy
to
call
such
cruel
enactments
by
the
sacred
name
of
law
replied
the
young
man
as
well
might
the
compacts
of
robbers
to
secure
their
plunder
be
called
law
the
walls
have
no
ears
or
tongues
signor
added
he
smiling
so
i
think
you
will
not
be
thrust
in
jail
for
having
such
an
imprudent
guest
but
as
i
was
saying
i
can
not
help
having
misgivings
concerning
the
future
i
want
you
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
concerning
the
welfare
of
those
young
ladies
and
to
inform
me
from
time
to
time
wheresoever
i
may
happen
to
be
i
will
furnish
you
with
my
address
and
i
wish
you
also
to
let
me
know
where
you
are
to
be
found
if
you
should
change
your
residence
my
father
and
royal
were
like
brothers
when
they
were
young
men
and
if
my
father
were
living
he
would
wish
to
protect
the
children
of
his
friend
the
duty
that
he
would
have
performed
devolves
upon
me
i
will
deposit
five
thousand
dollars
with
talbot
for
their
use
subject
to
your
order
should
any
unhappy
emergency
occur
i
say
use
bearing
in
mind
the
possibility
that
floracita
may
reappear
though
that
seems
very
unlikely
but
my
friends
i
wish
to
bind
you
by
the
most
solemn
promise
never
to
mention
my
name
in
connection
with
this
transaction
and
never
to
give
any
possible
clew
to
it
i
wish
you
also
to
conceal
my
having
come
here
to
inquire
concerning
them
if
they
ever
need
assistance
i
do
not
wish
them
to
know
or
conjecture
who
their
benefactor
is
if
you
have
occasion
to
call
for
the
money
merely
say
that
an
old
friend
of
their
father
deposited
it
for
their
use
i
will
solemnly
pledge
myself
to
secrecy
answered
the
signor
and
though
secrets
are
not
considered
very
safe
with
women
i
believe
madame
may
be
trusted
to
any
extent
where
the
welfare
of
these
girls
is
concerned
i
think
you
might
say
rather
more
than
that
my
friend
rejoined
madame
but
that
will
do
i
promise
to
do
in
all
respects
as
the
young
gentleman
has
requested
though
i
trust
and
believe
that
his
precautions
will
prove
needless
fitzgerald
is
very
wealthy
and
i
can
not
suppose
it
possible
that
he
would
ever
allow
rosabella
to
want
for
anything
that
may
be
replied
king
but
storms
come
up
suddenly
in
the
sunniest
skies
as
was
the
case
with
poor
royal
if
fitzgerald
love
remains
constant
he
may
fail
or
he
may
die
without
making
provision
for
her
manumission
or
support
that
is
very
true
answered
the
signor
how
much
forecast
you
yankees
have
i
should
hardly
deserve
that
compliment
my
friends
if
i
failed
to
supply
you
with
the
necessary
means
to
carry
out
my
wishes
he
put
two
hundred
dollars
into
the
hands
of
each
saying
you
will
keep
me
informed
on
the
subject
and
if
fitzgerald
should
be
ill
or
in
trouble
your
will
go
to
her
they
remonstrated
saying
it
was
too
much
take
it
then
for
what
you
done
replied
he
when
he
had
gone
madame
said
do
you
suppose
he
does
all
this
on
account
of
the
friendship
of
their
fathers
he
an
uncommon
son
if
he
does
replied
the
signor
but
i
glad
rosabella
has
such
a
firm
anchor
to
the
windward
if
a
storm
should
come
king
sought
talbot
again
and
placed
five
thousand
dollars
in
his
hands
with
the
necessary
forms
and
instructions
adding
should
any
unforeseen
emergency
render
a
larger
sum
necessary
please
to
advance
it
and
draw
on
me
i
am
obliged
to
sail
for
smyrna
soon
on
business
or
i
would
not
trouble
you
to
attend
to
this
talbot
smiled
significantly
as
he
said
these
young
ladies
must
be
very
charming
to
inspire
so
deep
an
interest
in
their
welfare
the
young
man
clad
in
the
armor
of
an
honest
purpose
did
not
feel
the
point
of
the
arrow
and
answered
quietly
they
very
charming
i
saw
them
for
a
few
hours
only
and
never
expect
to
see
them
again
their
father
and
mine
were
very
intimate
friends
and
i
feel
it
a
duty
to
protect
them
from
misfortune
if
possible
when
the
business
was
completed
and
they
had
exchanged
parting
salutations
he
turned
back
to
say
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
of
fitzgerald
of
savannah
i
never
had
any
acquaintance
with
him
replied
talbot
but
he
has
the
name
of
being
something
of
a
and
rather
fond
of
cards
can
the
death
of
floracita
be
apocryphal
thought
alfred
could
he
be
capable
of
selling
her
no
surely
mortal
man
could
not
wrong
that
artless
child
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
feeling
more
fatigued
and
dispirited
than
usual
he
had
done
all
that
was
possible
for
the
welfare
of
the
woman
who
had
first
inspired
him
with
love
but
o
what
would
he
not
have
given
for
such
an
opportunity
as
fitzgerald
had
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
that
the
utter
annihilation
of
his
hope
was
more
bitter
than
he
had
supposed
it
would
be
he
no
longer
doubted
that
he
would
have
married
her
if
he
could
in
full
view
of
all
her
antecedents
and
even
with
his
mother
prejudices
to
encounter
he
could
not
however
help
smiling
at
himself
as
he
thought
yet
how
very
different
she
was
from
what
i
had
previously
resolved
to
choose
how
wisely
i
have
talked
to
young
men
about
preferring
character
to
beauty
and
lo
i
found
myself
magnetized
at
first
sight
by
mere
beauty
but
manly
pride
rebelled
against
the
imputation
of
such
weakness
no
it
was
not
mere
outward
beauty
he
said
to
himself
true
i
had
no
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
qualities
of
her
soul
but
her
countenance
unmistakably
expressed
sweetness
modesty
and
dignity
and
the
inflexions
of
her
voice
were
a
sure
guaranty
for
refinement
with
visions
of
past
and
future
revolving
round
him
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
he
saw
rosabella
alone
on
a
plank
sinking
in
a
tempestuous
sea
free
as
he
thought
himself
from
superstition
the
dream
made
an
uncomfortable
impression
on
him
though
he
admitted
that
it
was
the
natural
sequence
of
his
waking
thoughts
chapter
xv
rosa
came
out
of
her
swoon
in
a
slow
fever
accompanied
with
delirium
tulee
was
afraid
to
leave
her
long
enough
to
go
to
the
plantation
in
search
of
tom
and
having
no
medicines
at
hand
she
did
the
best
thing
that
could
have
been
done
she
continually
moistened
the
parched
tongue
with
water
and
wiped
the
hot
skin
with
wet
cloths
while
she
was
doing
this
tears
fell
on
her
dear
young
mistress
lying
there
so
broken
and
helpless
talking
incoherently
about
her
father
and
floracita
about
being
a
slave
and
being
sold
this
continued
eight
or
ten
days
during
which
she
never
seemed
to
recognize
tulee
presence
or
to
be
conscious
where
she
was
she
was
never
wild
or
troublesome
but
there
were
frequent
restless
motions
and
signs
of
being
afraid
of
something
then
such
a
heavy
drowsiness
came
over
her
that
it
was
difficult
to
arouse
her
sufficiently
to
swallow
a
spoonful
of
nourishment
she
slept
and
slept
till
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
sleep
forever
nature
dear
goddess
was
doing
the
best
she
could
for
the
poor
weak
body
that
had
been
so
racked
by
the
torture
of
the
soul
three
weeks
passed
before
fitzgerald
again
made
his
appearance
at
the
lonely
cottage
he
had
often
thought
of
rosa
meanwhile
not
without
uneasiness
and
some
twinges
of
but
considering
the
unlucky
beginning
of
his
honeymoon
at
magnolia
lawn
he
deemed
it
prudent
to
be
very
assiduous
in
his
attentions
to
his
bride
he
took
no
walks
or
drives
without
her
and
she
seemed
satisfied
with
his
entire
devotion
but
a
veiled
singing
shadow
haunted
the
chambers
of
her
soul
when
she
and
her
husband
were
occupied
with
music
she
half
expected
the
pauses
would
be
interrupted
by
another
voice
nor
was
he
free
from
fears
that
those
wandering
sounds
would
come
again
but
annoyed
as
he
would
have
been
by
the
rich
tones
of
that
voice
once
so
dear
to
him
his
was
piqued
that
rosa
took
no
steps
to
recall
him
he
had
such
faith
in
his
power
over
her
that
he
had
been
daily
hoping
for
a
conciliatory
note
tom
had
been
as
attentive
to
the
invalid
as
his
enslaved
condition
would
admit
but
as
tulee
said
very
decidedly
that
she
did
want
massa
fitzgerald
to
show
his
face
there
he
did
not
volunteer
any
information
at
last
his
master
said
to
him
one
day
you

to
the
cottage
i
suppose
tom

how
are
they
getting
on

replied
tom
fitzgerald
found
some
food
for
vanity
in
this
news
he
presumed
the
illness
was
caused
by
love
for
him
which
rosa
found
herself
unable
to
conquer
this
idea
was
very
pleasant
to
him
for
it
was
not
easy
to
relinquish
the
beautiful
young
creature
who
had
loved
him
so
exclusively
making
a
pretext
of
business
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
throwing
a
farewell
kiss
to
his
bride
as
he
went
for
greater
security
he
travelled
a
few
moments
in
another
direction
and
then
sought
the
sequestered
cottage
by
a
circuitous
route
tulee
was
vexed
at
heart
when
she
heard
him
as
he
came
through
the
woods
humming
and
when
he
entered
the
cottage
she
wished
she
was
a
white
man
that
she
could
strike
him
but
when
he
said
tulee
how
is
your
mistress
she
civilly
answered
better
massa
he
passed
softly
into
rosa
room
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
in
a
loose
white
robe
over
which
fell
the
long
braids
of
her
dark
hair
the
warm
coloring
had
entirely
faded
from
her
cheeks
leaving
only
that
faintest
reflection
of
gold
which
she
inherited
from
her
mother
and
the
thinness
and
pallor
of
her
face
made
her
large
eyes
seem
larger
and
darker
they
were
open
but
strangely
veiled
as
if
shadows
were
resting
on
the
soul
like
fogs
upon
a
landscape
when
gerald
bent
over
her
she
did
not
see
him
though
she
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
he
called
her
by
the
tenderest
names
he
cried
out
in
agony
o
rosa
speak
to
me
darling
she
did
not
hear
him
he
had
never
before
been
so
deeply
moved
he
groaned
aloud
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
he
wept
when
tulee
hearing
the
sound
crept
in
to
see
whether
all
was
well
with
her
mistress
she
found
him
in
that
posture
she
went
out
silently
but
when
she
was
beyond
hearing
she
muttered
to
herself
ise
glad
he
got
any
human
feelin
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
moments
he
came
to
her
saying
o
tulee
do
you
think
she
going
to
die
could
a
doctor
save
her
no
massa
i
do
believe
she
going
to
die
replied
tulee
but
she
be
very
weak
for
a
great
while
i
do
think
all
the
doctors
in
the
world
could
do
poor
missy
rosy
any
good
it
her
soul
sick
massa
and
nobody
but
the
great
doctor
above
can
cure
that
her
words
cut
him
like
a
knife
but
without
any
attempt
to
excuse
the
wrong
he
had
done
he
said
i
am
going
to
savannah
for
the
winter
i
will
leave
tom
and
chloe
at
the
plantation
with
instructions
to
do
whatever
you
want
done
if
i
am
needed
you
can
send
tom
for
me
the
melancholy
wreck
he
had
seen
saddened
him
for
a
day
or
two
those
eyes
with
their
mysterious
expression
of
somnambulism
haunted
him
and
led
him
to
drown
uncomfortable
feelings
in
copious
draughts
of
wine
but
volatile
as
he
was
impressible
the
next
week
saw
him
the
gayest
of
the
gay
in
parties
at
savannah
where
his
pretty
little
bride
was
quite
the
fashion
at
the
cottage
there
was
little
change
except
that
chloe
by
her
master
permission
became
a
frequent
visitor
she
was
an
affectionate
useful
creature
with
good
voice
and
ear
and
a
little
wild
gleam
of
poetry
in
her
fervid
eyes
when
she
saw
rosa
lying
there
so
still
helpless
and
unconscious
as
a
babe
she
said
solemnly
de
sperit
hab
done
gone
somewhar
she
told
many
stories
of
wonderful
cures
she
had
performed
by
prayer
and
she
would
kneel
by
the
bedside
hour
after
hour
holding
the
invalid
hand
praying
o
lord
fotch
back
de
sperit
fotch
back
de
sperit
fotch
back
de
sperit
she
would
continue
to
repeat
in
ascending
tones
till
they
rose
to
wild
imploring
tulee
looking
on
one
day
said
poor
missy
rosy
do
hear
nothin
ye
say
though
ye
call
so
loud
de
good
lord
up
dar
he
hars
replied
chloe
reverently
pointing
upward
and
she
went
on
with
the
vehement
repetition
these
supplications
were
often
varied
with
methodist
hymns
and
negro
melodies
of
which
the
most
common
refrain
was
o
glory
glory
glory
but
whether
singing
or
praying
she
made
it
a
point
to
hold
the
invalid
hand
and
look
into
her
eyes
for
a
long
while
the
spirit
that
had
gone
somewhere
showed
no
signs
of
returning
in
obedience
to
the
persevering
summons
but
after
several
weeks
had
elapsed
there
was
a
blind
groping
for
chloe
hand
and
when
it
was
found
tulee
thought
she
perceived
something
like
a
little
flickering
gleam
flit
over
the
pale
face
still
neither
of
the
nurses
was
recognized
and
no
one
ever
knew
what
the
absent
soul
was
seeing
and
hearing
in
that
mysterious
somewhere
whither
it
had
flown
at
last
chloe
patient
faith
was
rewarded
by
a
feeble
pressure
of
her
hand
their
watchfulness
grew
more
excited
and
never
did
mother
welcome
the
first
gleam
of
intelligence
in
her
babe
with
more
thrilling
joy
than
the
first
faint
quivering
smile
on
rosa
lips
was
welcomed
by
those
anxious
faithful
friends
the
eyes
began
to
resume
their
natural
expression
the
fog
was
evidently
clearing
away
from
the
soul
and
the
sunshine
was
gleaming
through
the
process
of
resuscitation
was
thenceforth
constant
though
very
slow
it
was
three
months
after
those
cruel
blows
fell
upon
her
loving
heart
before
she
spoke
and
feebly
called
them
by
their
names
and
not
until
a
month
later
was
she
able
to
write
a
few
lines
to
quiet
the
anxiety
of
madame
and
the
signor
a
few
days
before
her
last
ghostly
visit
to
magnolia
lawn
she
had
written
them
a
very
joyful
letter
telling
them
of
preparations
to
acknowledge
her
as
his
wife
and
make
her
the
mistress
of
his
beautiful
home
they
received
the
tidings
with
great
joy
and
answered
with
hearty
congratulations
the
signor
was
impatient
to
write
to
king
but
madame
who
had
learned
precaution
and
management
by
the
trials
and
disappointments
of
a
changing
life
thought
it
best
to
wait
till
they
could
inform
him
of
the
actual
fact
as
rosa
had
never
been
in
the
habit
of
writing
oftener
than
once
in
four
or
five
weeks
they
felt
no
uneasiness
until
after
that
time
had
elapsed
and
even
then
they
said
to
each
other
she
delays
writing
as
we
do
until
everything
is
arranged
but
when
seven
or
eight
weeks
had
passed
madame
wrote
again
requesting
an
immediate
answer
owing
to
the
peculiar
position
of
the
sisters
letters
to
them
had
always
been
sent
under
cover
to
fitzgerald
and
when
this
letter
arrived
he
was
naturally
curious
to
ascertain
whether
madame
was
aware
of
his
marriage
it
so
happened
that
it
had
not
been
announced
in
the
only
paper
taken
by
the
signor
and
as
they
lived
in
a
little
foreign
world
of
their
own
they
remained
in
ignorance
of
it
having
read
the
letter
fitzgerald
thought
as
rosa
was
not
in
a
condition
to
read
it
it
had
better
be
committed
to
the
flames
but
fearing
that
madame
or
the
signor
might
come
to
savannah
in
search
of
tidings
and
that
some
unlucky
accident
might
bring
them
to
speech
of
his
bride
he
concluded
it
was
best
to
ward
off
such
a
contingency
he
accordingly
wrote
a
very
studied
letter
to
madame
telling
her
that
with
her
knowledge
of
the
world
he
supposed
she
must
be
well
aware
that
the
daughter
of
a
quadroon
slave
could
not
be
legally
recognized
as
the
wife
of
a
southern
gentleman
that
he
still
loved
rosa
better
than
any
other
woman
but
wishing
for
legal
heirs
to
his
hereditary
estate
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
marry
he
stated
that
rosa
was
recovering
from
a
slow
fever
and
had
requested
him
to
say
that
they
must
not
feel
anxious
about
her
that
she
had
everything
for
her
comfort
had
been
carefully
attended
by
two
good
nurses
was
daily
getting
better
and
would
write
in
a
few
weeks
meanwhile
if
anything
retarded
her
complete
recovery
he
would
again
write
this
letter
he
thought
would
meet
the
present
emergency
his
plans
for
the
future
were
unsettled
he
still
hoped
that
rosa
alone
and
unprotected
as
she
was
without
the
legal
ownership
of
herself
and
subdued
by
sickness
and
trouble
would
finally
accede
to
his
terms
she
in
her
unconscious
state
was
of
course
ignorant
of
this
correspondence
for
some
time
after
she
recognized
her
nurses
she
continued
to
be
very
drowsy
and
manifested
no
curiosity
concerning
her
condition
she
was
as
passive
in
their
hands
as
an
infant
and
they
treated
her
as
such
chloe
sung
to
her
and
told
her
stories
which
were
generally
concerning
her
own
remarkable
experiences
for
she
was
a
great
seer
of
visions
perhaps
she
owed
them
to
gifts
of
imagination
of
which
culture
would
have
made
her
a
poet
but
to
her
they
seemed
to
be
an
objective
reality
she
often
told
of
seeing
jesus
as
she
walked
to
and
from
the
plantation
once
she
had
met
him
riding
upon
thistle
with
a
golden
crown
upon
his
head
one
evening
he
had
run
before
her
all
the
way
as
a
very
little
child
whose
shining
garments
lighted
up
all
the
woods
four
months
after
the
swift
destruction
of
her
hopes
rosa
after
taking
some
drink
from
tulee
hand
looked
up
in
her
face
and
said
how
long
have
i
been
sick
dear
tulee
no

about

darling
she
replied
patting
her
head
fondly
ye
must
disturb
your
mind
that
after
a
little
pause
the
invalid
said
but

listened
with
a
serious
pleased
expression
in
her
face
for
the
words
of
her
simple
comforter
inspired
a
vague
consciousness
of
some
supernatural
presence
surrounding
her
with
invisible
protection
a
few
hours
after
she
asked
with
head
averted
from
her
attendant

she
manifested
no
emotion
and
after
a
brief
silence
she
inquired
for
letters
from
madame
being
informed
that
there
were
none
she
expressed
a
wish
to
be
bolstered
up
that
she
might
try
to
write
a
few
lines
to
her
old
friend
chloe
in
reply
whispered
something
in
her
ear
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
her
cheeks
flushed
the
first
time
for
many
a
day
but
she
immediately
closed
her
eyes
and
tears
glistened
on
the
long
dark
lashes
in
obedience
to
the
caution
of
her
nurses
she
deferred
any
attempt
to
write
till
the
next
week
she
remained
very
silent
during
the
day
but
they
knew
that
her
thoughts
were
occupied
for
they
often
saw
tears
oozing
through
the
closed
eyelids
meanwhile
her
friends
in
new
orleans
were
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
fitzgerald
had
again
written
in
a
strain
very
similar
to
his
first
letter
but
from
rosa
herself
nothing
had
been
received
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
this
said
madame
rosa
is
not
a
girl
that
would
consent
to
a
secondary
position
where
her
heart
was
concerned
you
know
how
common
it
is
for
quadroons
to
accede
to
such
double
arrangements
rejoined
the
signor
of
course
i
am
well
aware
of
that
she
replied
but
they
are
educated
from
childhood
to
accommodate
themselves
to
their
subordinate
position
as
a
necessity
that
can
not
be
avoided
it
was
far
otherwise
with
rosa
moreover
i
believe
there
is
too
much
of
grandpa
gonsalez
in
her
to
submit
to
anything
she
deemed
dishonorable
i
think
my
friend
somebody
ought
to
go
to
savannah
to
inquire
into
this
business
if
you
should
go
i
fear
you
would
get
into
a
duel
you
know
dear
floracita
used
to
call
you
signor
pimentero
but
fitzgerald
wo
fight
let
me
say
what
i
will
so
i
think
i
had
better
go
yes
you
had
better
go
you
a
born
diplomate
which
i
am
not
replied
the
signor
arrangements
were
accordingly
made
for
going
in
a
day
or
two
but
they
were
arrested
by
three
or
four
lines
from
rosa
stating
that
she
was
getting
well
that
she
had
everything
for
her
comfort
and
would
write
more
fully
soon
but
what
surprised
them
was
that
she
requested
them
to
address
her
as
madame
gonsalez
under
cover
to
her
mantuamaker
in
savannah
whose
address
was
given
that
shows
plainly
enough
that
she
and
fitzgerald
have
dissolved
partnership
said
madame
but
as
she
does
not
ask
me
to
come
i
will
wait
for
her
letter
of
explanation
meanwhile
however
she
wrote
very
affectionately
in
reply
to
the
brief
missive
urging
rosa
to
come
to
new
orleans
and
enclosing
fifty
dollars
with
the
statement
that
an
old
friend
of
her
father
had
died
and
left
a
legacy
for
his
daughters
madame
had
as
floracita
observed
a
talent
for
arranging
the
truth
with
variations
the
march
of
the
southern
spring
returned
wreathed
with
garlands
and
its
pathway
strewn
with
flowers
she
gave
warm
kisses
to
the
firs
and
pines
as
she
passed
and
they
returned
her
love
with
fragrant
sighs
the
garden
at
magnolia
lawn
had
dressed
itself
with
jonquils
hyacinths
and
roses
and
its
bower
was
a
nest
of
glossy
greenery
where
were
singing
their
varied
tunes
moving
their
white
in
time
to
their
music
fitzgerald
who
was
not
strong
in
health
was
bent
upon
returning
thither
early
in
the
season
and
the
servants
were
busy
preparing
for
her
reception
chloe
was
rarely
spared
to
go
to
the
hidden
cottage
where
her
attendance
upon
rosa
was
no
longer
necessary
but
tom
came
once
a
week
as
he
always
had
done
to
do
whatever
jobs
or
errands
the
inmates
required
one
day
tulee
was
surprised
to
hear
her
mistress
ask
him
whether
fitzgerald
was
at
the
plantation
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
she
said
have
the
goodness
to
tell
him
that
missy
rosy
would
like
to
see
him
soon
when
fitzgerald
received
the
message
he
adjusted
his
necktie
at
the
mirror
and
smiled
over
his
thoughts
he
had
hopes
that
the
proud
beauty
was
beginning
to
relent
having
left
his
wife
in
savannah
there
was
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
obeying
the
summons
as
he
passed
over
the
cottage
lawn
he
saw
that
rosa
was
sewing
at
the
window
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
with
the
idea
that
she
might
come
out
to
meet
him
but
when
he
entered
the
parlor
she
was
still
occupied
with
her
work
she
rose
on
his
entrance
and
moved
a
chair
toward
him
and
when
he
said
half
timidly
how
do
you
do
now
dear
rosa
she
quietly
replied
much
better
i
thank
you
i
have
sent
for
you
fitzgerald
to
ask
a
favor
if
it
is
anything
in
my
power
it
shall
be
granted
he
replied
it
is
a
very
easy
thing
for
you
to
do
rejoined
she
and
very
important
to
me
i
want
you
to
give
me
papers
of
manumission
are
you
so
afraid
of
me
he
asked
coloring
as
he
remembered
a
certain
threat
he
had
uttered
i
did
not
intend
the
request
as
any
reproach
to
you
answered
she
mildly
but
simply
as
a
very
urgent
necessity
to
myself
as
soon
as
my
health
will
permit
i
wish
to
be
doing
something
for
my
own
support
and
if
possible
to
repay
you
what
you
expended
for
me
and
my
sister
do
you
take
me
for
a
mean
yankee
exclaimed
he
indignantly
that
you
propose
such
an
account
of
dollars
and
cents
i
expressed
my
own
wishes
not
what
i
supposed
you
would
require
replied
she
but
aside
from
that
you
can
surely
imagine
it
must
be
painful
to
have
my
life
haunted
by
this
dreadful
spectre
of
slavery
rosa
said
he
earnestly
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
i
did
not
purchase
you
as
a
slave
or
consider
you
a
slave
i
expended
money
with
all
my
heart
to
save
my
from
misfortune
i
believe
those
were
your
feelings
then
she
replied
but
let
the
past
be
buried
i
simply
ask
you
now
as
a
gentleman
who
has
it
in
his
power
to
confer
a
great
favor
on
an
unprotected
woman
whether
you
will
manumit
me
certainly
i
will
answered
he
much
discomposed
by
her
cool
business
tone
she
rose
at
once
and
placed
the
before
him
it
was
the
pretty
little
desk
he
had
given
her
for
a
birthday
present
he
put
his
finger
on
it
and
looking
up
in
her
face
with
one
of
his
old
insinuating
glances
he
said
rosa
do
you
remember
what
we
said
when
i
gave
you
this
without
answering
the
question
she
said
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
write
it
now
why
in
such
haste
inquired
he
i
have
given
you
my
promise
and
do
you
suppose
i
have
no
sense
of
honor
a
retort
rose
to
her
lips
but
she
suppressed
it
none
of
us
can
be
sure
of
the
future
she
replied
you
know
what
happened
when
my
dear
father
died
overcome
by
that
tender
memory
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
the
tears
stole
through
her
fingers
he
attempted
to
kiss
away
the
tears
but
she
drew
back
and
went
on
to
say
at
that
time
i
learned
the
bitter
significance
of
the
law
child
shall
follow
the
condition
of
the
mother
it
was
not
mainly
on
my
own
account
that
i
sent
for
you
fitzgerald
i
wish
to
secure
my
child
from
such
a
dreadful
contingency
as
ruined
me
and
my
sister
she
blushed
and
lowered
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
o
rosa
he
exclaimed
the
impulse
was
strong
to
fold
her
to
his
heart
but
he
could
not
pass
the
barrier
of
her
modest
dignity
after
an
embarrassed
pause
she
looked
up
bashfully
and
said
knowing
this
you
surely
will
not
refuse
to
write
it
now
i
must
see
a
lawyer
and
obtain
witnesses
he
replied
she
sighed
heavily
i
do
know
what
forms
are
necessary
said
she
but
i
beg
of
you
to
take
such
steps
as
will
make
me
perfectly
secure
against
any
accidents
and
do
delay
it
fitzgerald
will
you
send
the
papers
next
week
i
see
you
have
no
confidence
in
me
replied
he
sadly
then
suddenly
dropping
on
his
knees
beside
her
he
exclaimed
o
rosa
do
call
me
again
do
call
me
gerald
once
more
do
say
you
forgive
me
she
drew
back
a
little
but
answered
very
gently
i
do
forgive
you
and
i
hope
your
innocent
little
wife
will
never
regret
having
loved
you
for
that
is
a
very
bitter
trial
i
sincerely
wish
you
may
be
happy
and
you
may
rest
assured
i
shall
not
attempt
to
interfere
with
your
happiness
but
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
talk
much
please
promise
to
send
those
papers
next
week
he
made
the
promise
with
averted
head
and
a
voice
that
was
slightly
tremulous
i
thank
you
she
replied
but
i
am
much
fatigued
and
will
bid
you
good
morning
she
rose
to
leave
the
room
but
turned
back
and
added
with
solemn
earnestness
i
think
it
will
be
a
consolation
on
your
if
you
do
not
neglect
to
fulfil
rosa
last
request
she
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
fastened
the
door
and
threw
herself
on
the
couch
utterly
exhausted
how
strange
and
spectral
this
meeting
seemed
she
heard
his
retreating
footsteps
without
the
slightest
desire
to
obtain
a
last
glimpse
of
his
figure
how
entirely
he
had
passed
out
of
her
life
he
who
so
lately
was
her
life
the
next
day
rosa
wrote
as
follows
to
madame
and
the
signor
dearest
and
best
friends
it
would
take
days
to
explain
to
you
all
that
has
happened
since
i
wrote
you
that
long
happy
letter
and
at
present
i
have
not
strength
to
write
much
when
we
meet
we
will
talk
about
it
more
fully
though
i
wish
to
avoid
the
miserable
particulars
as
far
as
possible
the
preparations
i
so
foolishly
supposed
were
being
made
for
me
were
for
a
rich
northern
bride
a
pretty
little
creature
the
marriage
with
me
it
seems
was
counterfeit
when
i
discovered
it
my
first
impulse
was
to
fly
to
you
but
a
strange
illness
came
over
me
and
i
was
oblivious
of
everything
for
four
months
my
good
tulee
and
a
black
woman
named
chloe
brought
me
back
to
life
by
their
patient
nursing
i
suppose
it
was
wrong
but
when
i
remembered
who
and
what
i
was
i
felt
sorry
they
did
let
me
go
i
was
again
seized
with
a
longing
to
fly
to
you
who
were
as
father
and
mother
to
me
and
my
darling
little
sister
in
the
days
of
our
first
misfortune
but
i
was
too
weak
to
move
and
i
am
still
far
from
being
able
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
such
a
journey
moreover
i
am
fastened
here
for
the
present
by
another
consideration
fitzgerald
says
he
bought
us
of
papa
creditors
and
that
i
am
his
slave
i
have
entreated
him
for
the
sake
of
our
unborn
child
to
manumit
me
and
he
has
promised
to
do
it
if
i
could
only
be
safe
in
new
orleans
it
is
my
wish
to
come
and
live
with
you
and
find
some
way
to
support
myself
and
my
child
but
i
could
have
no
peace
so
long
as
there
was
the
remotest
possibility
of
being
claimed
as
slaves
fitzgerald
may
not
mean
that
i
shall
ever
come
to
harm
but
he
may
die
without
providing
against
it
as
poor
papa
did
i
do
know
what
forms
are
necessary
for
my
safety
i
do
understand
how
it
is
that
there
is
no
law
to
protect
a
defenceless
woman
who
has
done
no
wrong
i
will
wait
here
a
little
longer
to
recruit
my
strength
and
have
this
matter
settled
i
wish
it
were
possible
for
you
my
dear
good
mother
to
come
to
me
for
two
or
three
weeks
in
june
then
perhaps
you
could
take
back
with
you
your
poor
rosa
and
her
baby
if
their
lives
should
be
spared
but
if
you
can
not
come
there
is
an
experienced
old
negress
here
called
granny
nan
who
tulee
says
will
take
good
care
of
me
i
thank
you
for
your
sympathizing
loving
letter
who
could
friend
be
that
left
me
a
legacy
i
was
thankful
for
the
fifty
dollars
for
it
is
very
unpleasant
to
me
to
use
any
of
fitzgerald
money
though
he
tells
tom
to
supply
everything
i
want
if
it
were
not
for
you
dear
friends
i
do
think
i
should
have
courage
to
try
to
live
but
something
sustains
me
wonderfully
through
these
dreadful
trials
sometimes
i
think
poor
chloe
prayers
bring
me
help
from
above
for
the
good
soul
is
always
praying
for
me
adieu
may
the
good
god
bless
you

loving

grateful

week
passed
after
week
and
the
promised
papers
did
not
come
the
weary
days
dragged
their
slow
length
along
unsoothed
by
anything
except
tulee
loving
care
and
madame
cheering
letters
the
piano
was
never
opened
for
all
tones
of
music
were
draped
in
mourning
and
its
harmonies
were
a
funeral
march
over
buried
love
but
she
enjoyed
the
open
air
and
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
sometimes
she
walked
slowly
about
the
lawn
and
sometimes
tulee
set
her
upon
back
and
led
him
round
and
round
through
the
but
out
of
the
woods
that
concealed
their
nest
they
never
ventured
lest
they
should
meet
fitzgerald
tulee
who
was
somewhat
proud
on
her
mistress
account
was
vexed
by
this
limitation
i
do
see
why
ye
should
hide
yerself
from
her
said
she
yese
as
good
as
she
is
and
ye
nothin
to
be
shamed
of
it
is
on
my
own
account
that
i
wish
to
avoid
her
seeing
me
replied
rosa
but
i
pity
the
innocent
young
creature
she
did
know
of
disturbing
my
happiness
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
disturb
hers
as
the
weeks
glided
away
without
bringing
any
fulfilment
of
fitzgerald
promise
anxiety
changed
to
distrust
she
twice
requested
tom
to
ask
his
master
for
the
papers
he
had
spoken
of
and
received
a
verbal
answer
that
they
would
be
sent
as
soon
as
they
were
ready
there
were
greater
obstacles
in
the
way
than
she
in
her
inexperience
was
aware
of
the
laws
of
georgia
restrained
humane
impulses
by
forbidding
the
manumission
of
a
slave
consequently
he
must
either
incur
very
undesirable
publicity
by
applying
to
the
legislature
for
a
special
exception
in
this
case
or
she
must
be
manumitted
in
another
state
he
would
gladly
have
managed
a
journey
without
the
company
of
his
wife
if
he
could
thereby
have
regained
his
former
influence
with
rosa
but
he
was
disinclined
to
take
so
much
trouble
to
free
her
entirely
from
him
when
he
promised
to
send
the
papers
he
intended
to
satisfy
her
with
a
sham
certificate
as
he
had
done
with
a
counterfeit
marriage
but
he
deferred
doing
it
because
he
had
a
vague
sense
of
satisfaction
in
being
able
to
tantalize
the
superior
woman
over
whom
he
felt
that
he
no
longer
had
any
other
power
chapter

madame
anxiety
was
much
diminished
after
she
began
to
receive
letters
in
rosa
own
handwriting
but
knowing
the
laws
of
georgia
and
no
longer
doubtful
concerning
fitzgerald
real
character
she
placed
small
reliance
upon
his
promise
of
manumission
this
is
another
of
his
deceptions
said
she
to
the
signor
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
the
state
of
things
and
i
am
convinced
there
will
be
no
security
in
this
country
for
that
poor
girl
you
have
been
saying
for
some
time
that
you
wanted
to
see
your
beautiful
italy
again
and
i
have
the
same
feeling
about
my
beautiful
france
we
each
of
us
have
a
little
money
laid
up
and
if
we
draw
upon
the
fund
king
has
deposited
we
can
take
rosabella
to
europe
and
bring
her
out
as
a
singer
she
would
have
a
great
career
no
doubt
replied
the
signor
and
i
was
going
to
suggest
such
a
plan
to
you
but
you
would
have
to
change
your
name
again
on
my
account
madame
for
i
was
obliged
to
leave
italy
because
i
was
discovered
to
be
one
of
the
carbonari
and
though
fifteen
years
have
elapsed
it
is
possible
the
watchful
authorities
have
not
forgotten
my
name
that
a
trifling
obstacle
resumed
madame
you
had
better
give
notice
to
your
pupils
at
once
that
you
intend
to
leave
as
soon
as
present
engagements
are
fulfilled
i
will
use
up
my
stock
for
fancy
articles
and
sell
off
as
fast
as
possible
that
we
may
be
ready
to
start
for
europe
as
soon
as
rosa
has
sufficient
strength
this
resolution
was
immediately
acted
upon
but
the
fates
were
unpropitious
to
madame
anticipated
visit
to
the
lonely
island
a
few
days
before
her
intended
departure
the
signor
was
taken
seriously
ill
and
remained
so
for
two
or
three
weeks
he
fretted
and
fumed
more
on
her
account
than
his
own
but
she
as
usual
went
through
the
trial
bravely
she
tried
to
compensate
rosa
for
the
disappointment
as
far
as
she
could
by
writing
frequent
letters
cheerful
in
tone
though
prudently
cautious
concerning
details
fearing
that
fitzgerald
suspicions
might
be
excited
by
an
apparent
cessation
of
correspondence
she
continued
to
write
occasionally
under
cover
to
him
in
a
style
adapted
to
his
views
in
case
he
should
take
a
fancy
to
open
the
letters
the
signor
laughed
and
said
your
talent
for
diplomacy
is
not
likely
to
rust
for
want
of
use
madame
even
rosa
sad
at
heart
as
she
was
could
not
help
smiling
sometimes
at
the
totally
different
tone
of
the
letters
which
she
received
under
different
covers
she
had
become
so
accustomed
to
passive
endurance
that
no
murmur
escaped
her
when
she
found
that
her
only
white
friend
could
not
come
to
her
as
she
had
expected
granny
nan
boasted
of
having
nursed
many
grand
white
ladies
and
her
skill
in
the
vocation
proved
equal
to
her
pretensions
only
her
faithful
tulee
and
the
kind
old
colored
mammy
were
with
her
when
hovering
between
life
and
death
she
heard
the
cry
that
announced
the
advent
of
a
human
soul
nature
deranged
by
bodily
illness
and
mental
trouble
provided
no
nourishment
for
the
little
one
but
this
which
under
happier
circumstances
would
have
been
a
disappointment
called
forth
no
expressions
of
regret
from
the
patient
sufferer
when
tulee
held
the
babe
before
her
in
its
first
dress
she
smiled
faintly
but
immediately
closed
her
eyes
as
she
lay
there
day
after
day
with
the
helpless
little
creature
nestling
in
her
arms
the
one
consoling
reflection
was
that
she
had
not
given
birth
to
a
daughter
a
chaos
of
thoughts
were
revolving
through
her
mind
the
theme
of
all
the
variations
being
how
different
it
was
from
what
it
might
have
been
if
the
ideal
of
her
girlhood
had
not
been
shattered
so
cruelly
had
it
not
been
for
that
glimmering
light
in
the
future
which
madame
so
assiduously
presented
to
her
view
courage
would
have
forsaken
her
utterly
as
it
was
she
often
listened
to
the
dash
of
the
sea
with
the
melancholy
feeling
that
rest
might
be
found
beneath
its
waves
but
she
was
still
very
young
the
sky
was
bright
the
earth
was
lovely
and
she
had
a
friend
who
had
promised
to
provide
a
safe
asylum
for
her
somewhere
she
tried
to
regain
her
strength
that
she
might
leave
the
island
with
all
its
sad
reminders
of
departed
happiness
thinking
of
this
she
rose
one
day
and
wandered
into
the
little
parlor
to
take
a
sort
of
farewell
look
there
was
the
piano
so
long
unopened
with
a
whole
epic
of
love
and
sorrow
in
its
remembered
tones
the
pretty
little
table
her
mother
had
painted
the
basket
she
had
received
from
her
father
after
his
death
floracita
paintings
and
mosses
and
innumerable
little
tokens
of
gerald
love
walking
round
slowly
and
feebly
in
presence
of
all
those
memories
how
alone
she
felt
with
none
to
speak
to
but
tulee
and
the
old
colored
mammy
she
who
had
been
so
tenderly
cared
for
by
her
parents
so
idolized
by
him
to
whom
she
gave
her
heart
she
was
still
gazing
pensively
on
these
souvenirs
of
the
past
when
her
attention
was
arrested
by
tom
voice
saying
dar
a
picaninny
at
de
grat
hus
how
turrer
picaninny
the
thought
rushed
upon
her
ah
that
baby
had
a
father
to
welcome
it
and
fondle
it
but
poor
babe
a
sensation
of
faintness
came
over
her
and
holding
on
by
the
chairs
and
tables
she
staggered
back
to
the
bed
she
had
left
before
the
babe
was
a
fortnight
old
tom
announced
that
he
was
to
accompany
his
master
to
new
orleans
whither
he
had
been
summoned
by
business
the
occasion
was
eagerly
seized
by
rosa
to
send
a
letter
and
some
small
articles
to
madame
and
the
signor
tulee
gave
him
very
particular
directions
how
to
find
the
house
and
charged
him
over
and
over
again
to
tell
them
everything
when
she
cautioned
him
not
to
let
his
master
know
that
he
carried
anything
tom
placed
his
thumb
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
moved
the
fingers
significantly
saying
dis

foresaw

would

he
of
course
had
little
control
over
his
own
motions
he
however
promised
to
try
and
tulee
told
him
she
had
great
confidence
in
his
ingenuity
in
finding
out
ways
and
means
an
i
tinks
a
heap
o
ye
tulee
ye
knows
a
heap
more
dan
niggers
was
tom
responsive
compliment
in
his
eyes
tulee
was
in
fact
a
highly
accomplished
person
for
though
she
could
neither
read
nor
write
she
had
caught
the
manners
and
speech
of
white
people
by
living
almost
exclusively
with
them
and
she
was
by
habit
as
familiar
with
french
as
english
beside
having
a
little
smattering
of
spanish
to
have
his
ingenuity
praised
by
her
operated
as
a
fillip
upon
his
vanity
and
he
inwardly
resolved
to
run
the
risk
of
a
flogging
rather
than
fail
to
do
her
bidding
he
was
also
most
loyal
in
the
service
of
rosa
whose
beauty
and
kindliness
had
won
his
heart
before
his
sympathy
had
been
called
out
by
her
misfortunes
but
none
of
them
foresaw
what
important
consequences
would
result
from
his
mission
the
first
day
he
was
in
new
orleans
he
found
no
hour
when
he
could
be
absent
without
the
liability
of
being
called
for
by
his
master
the
next
day
bruteman
dined
with
his
master
and
tom
was
in
attendance
upon
the
table
their
conversation
was
at
first
about
cotton
crops
the
prices
of
negroes
and
other
business
matters
to
which
tom
paid
little
attention
but
a
few
minutes
afterward
his
ears
were
wide
open
i
suppose
you
came
prepared
to
pay
that
debt
you
owe
me
said
bruteman
i
am
obliged
to
ask
an
extension
of
your
indulgence
replied
fitzgerald
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
raise
that
sum
just
now
how
is
that
possible
inquired
bruteman
when
you
have
married
the
daughter
of
a
boston
nabob
the
close
old
yankee
keeps
hold
of
most
of
his
money
while
he
lives
rejoined
his
companion
and
fitzgerald
has
expensive
tastes
to
be
gratified
and
do
you
expect
me
to
wait
till
the
old
yankee
dies
asked
bruteman
gentlemen
generally
consider
themselves
bound
to
be
prompt
in
paying
debts
of
honor
i
pay
you
as
soon
as
i
can
what
the
devil
can
you
ask
more
exclaimed
fitzgerald
it
seems
to
me
it
not
the
part
of
a
gentleman
to
play
the
dun
so
continually
they
had
already
drank
pretty
freely
but
bruteman
took
up
a
bottle
and
said
let
us
drink
another
glass
to
the
speedy
replenishing
of
your
purse
they
poured
full
bumpers
touched
glasses
and
drank
the
contents
there
was
a
little
pause
during
which
bruteman
sat
twirling
his
glass
between
thumb
and
finger
with
looks
directed
toward
his
companion
all
at
once
he
said
fitzgerald
did
you
ever
find
those
handsome
octoroon
girls
what
octoroon
girls
inquired
the
other
o
you
disremember
them
do
you
rejoined
he
i
mean
how
did
that
bargain
turn
out
that
you
made
with
royal
creditors
you
seemed
to
have
small
chance
of
finding
the
girls
unless
indeed
you
hid
them
away
first
for
the
purpose
of
buying
them
for
less
than
half
they
would
have
brought
to
the
creditors
which
of
course
is
not
to
be
supposed
because
no
gentleman
would
do
such
a
thing
thrown
off
his
guard
by
too
much
wine
fitzgerald
vociferated
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
am
no
gentleman
bruteman
smiled
as
he
answered
i
said
such
a
thing
was
not
to
be
supposed
but
come
fitzgerald
let
us
understand
one
another
rather
a
devilish
sight
have
those
girls
than
the
money
you
owe
me
make
them
over
to
me
and
i
cancel
the
debt
otherwise
i
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
laying
an
attachment
on
some
of
your
property
there
was
a
momentary
silence
before
fitzgerald
answered
one
of
them
is
dead
which
one
inquired
his
comrade
flora
the
youngest
was
drowned
and
that
queenly
beauty
where
is
she
i
do
know
that
i
ever
heard
her
name
rosabella
royal
replied
fitzgerald
she
is
living
at
a
convenient
distance
from
my
plantation
well
i
will
be
generous
said
bruteman
if
you
will
make
over
to
me
i
will
cancel
the
debt
she
is
not
in
strong
health
at
present
rejoined
fitzgerald
she
has
a
babe
about
two
weeks
old
you
know
you
have
invited
me
to
visit
your
island
two
or
three
weeks
hence
replied
bruteman
and
then
i
shall
depend
upon
you
to
introduce
me
to
your
fair
rosamond
but
we
will
draw
up
the
papers
and
sign
them
now
if
you
please
some
jests
unfit
for
repetition
were
uttered
by
the
creditor
to
which
the
unhappy
debtor
made
no
reply
when
he
called
tom
to
bring
paper
and
ink
the
observing
servant
noticed
that
he
was
very
pale
though
but
a
few
moments
before
his
face
had
been
flushed
that
night
he
tried
to
drown
recollection
in
desperate
gambling
and
frequent
draughts
of
wine
between
one
and
two
in
the
morning
his
roisterous
companions
were
led
off
by
their
servants
and
he
was
put
into
bed
by
tom
where
he
immediately
dropped
into
a
perfectly
senseless
sleep
as
soon
as
there
was
sufficient
light
tom
started
for
the
house
of
the
signor
judging
that
he
was
safe
from
his
master
for
three
hours
at
least
notwithstanding
the
earliness
of
the
hour
madame
made
her
appearance
in
a
very
few
moments
after
her
servant
informed
her
who
was
in
waiting
and
the
signor
soon
followed
in
the
course
of
the
next
hour
and
a
half
an
incredible
amount
of
talking
was
done
in
negro
lingo
and
broken
english
the
impetuous
signor
strode
up
and
down
clenching
his
fists
cursing
slavery
and
sending
fitzgerald
to
the
devil
in
a
volley
of
phrases
hard
enough
in
their
significance
though
uttered
in
italian
swearing
does
no
good
my
friend
said
madame
besides
there
time
for
it
rosabella
must
be
brought
away
immediately
bruteman
will
be
on
the
alert
you
may
depend
she
slipped
through
his
fingers
once
and
he
wo
trust
fitzgerald
again
the
signor
cooled
down
and
proposed
to
go
for
her
himself
but
that
was
overruled
in
a
very
kind
way
by
his
prudent
wife
who
argued
that
he
was
not
well
enough
for
such
an
exciting
adventure
or
to
be
left
without
her
nursing
when
his
mind
would
be
such
a
prey
to
uneasiness
it
was
her
proposition
to
send
at
once
for
her
cousin
duroy
and
have
him
receive
very
particular
directions
from
tom
how
to
reach
the
island
and
find
the
cottage
tom
said
he
did
know
whether
he
could
get
away
for
an
hour
again
because
his
master
was
always
very
angry
if
he
was
out
of
the
way
when
called
but
if
duroy
would
come
to
the
hotel
he
would
find
chances
to
tell
him
what
to
do
and
that
plan
was
immediately
carried
into
effect
while
these
things
were
going
on
in
new
orleans
fitzgerald
was
taking
frequent
drives
about
the
lovely
island
with
her
mother
bell
while
rosa
was
occasionally
perambulating
her
little
circuit
of
woods
on
the
back
of
patient
thistle
one
day
fitzgerald
and
her
mother
received
an
invitation
to
the
welby
plantation
to
meet
some
northern
acquaintances
who
were
there
and
as
strength
was
not
yet
fully
restored
welby
proposed
that
they
should
remain
all
night
chloe
who
had
lost
her
own
baby
was
chosen
to
nurse
her
master
heir
and
was
consequently
tied
so
closely
that
she
could
find
no
chance
to
go
to
the
cottage
whose
inmates
she
had
a
great
longing
to
see
but
when
master
and
mistress
were
both
gone
she
thought
she
might
take
her
freedom
for
a
while
without
incurring
any
great
risk
the
other
servants
agreed
to
keep
her
secret
and
joe
the
coachman
promised
to
drive
her
most
of
the
way
when
he
came
back
with
the
carriage
accordingly
she
made
her
appearance
at
the
cottage
quite
unexpectedly
to
the
great
joy
of
tulee
when
she
unwrapped
the
little
baby
from
its
foldings
of
white
muslin
tulee
exclaimed
he
looks
jus
like
his
father
and
so
does
missy
rosy
baby
i
will
make
poor
missy
feel
bad
to
see
it
for
she
do
know
it
yes
i
do
tulee
said
rosa
who
had
heard
chloe
voice
and
gone
out
to
greet
her
i
heard
tom
tell
you
about
it
she
took
up
the
little
hand
scarcely
bigger
than
a
bird
claw
and
while
it
twined
closely
about
her
finger
she
looked
into
its
eyes
so
like
to
gerald
in
shape
and
color
she
was
hoping
that
those
handsome
eyes
might
never
be
used
as
his
had
been
but
she
gave
no
utterance
to
her
thoughts
her
manner
toward
chloe
was
full
of
grateful
kindness
and
the
poor
bondwoman
had
some
happy
hours
playing
free
for
a
while
she
laid
the
infant
on
its
face
in
her
lap
trotting
it
gently
and
patting
its
back
while
she
talked
over
with
tulee
all
the
affairs
at
the
grat
hus
and
when
the
babe
was
asleep
she
asked
and
obtained
rosa
permission
to
lay
him
on
her
bed
beside
his
little
brother
then
poor
chloe
soul
took
wing
and
soared
aloft
among
clouds
as
she
prayed
and
sang
her
fervent
hymns
and
told
of
her
visions
and
revelations
she
experienced
satisfaction
similar
to
that
of
a
troubadour
or
palmer
from
holy
land
with
an
admiring
audience
listening
to
his
wonderful
adventures
while
she
was
thus
occupied
tulee
came
in
hastily
to
say
that
a
stranger
gentleman
was
coming
toward
the
house
such
an
event
in
that
lonely
place
produced
general
excitement
and
some
consternation
rosa
at
once
drew
her
curtain
and
bolted
the
door
but
tulee
soon
came
rapping
gently
saying
it
only
i
missy
rosy
as
the
door
partially
opened
she
said
it
a
friend
madame
has
sent
ye
rosa
stepping
forward
recognized
duroy
the
cousin
in
whose
clothes
madame
had
escaped
with
them
from
new
orleans
she
was
very
slightly
acquainted
with
him
but
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
see
any
one
who
knew
of
the
old
times
that
she
could
hardly
refrain
from
throwing
herself
on
his
neck
and
bursting
into
tears
as
she
grasped
his
hand
with
a
close
pressure
he
felt
the
thinness
of
her
emaciated
fingers
the
paleness
of
her
cheeks
and
the
saddened
expression
of
her
large
eyes
excited
his
compassion
he
was
too
polite
to
express
it
in
words
but
it
was
signified
by
the
deference
of
his
manner
and
the
extreme
gentleness
of
his
tones
he
talked
of
madame
anxious
love
for
her
of
the
signor
improving
health
of
the
near
completion
of
their
plan
for
going
to
europe
and
of
their
intention
to
take
her
with
them
rosa
was
full
of
thankfulness
but
said
she
was
as
yet
incapable
of
much
exertion
duroy
went
on
to
speak
of
tom
visit
to
madame
and
slowly
and
cautiously
he
prepared
the
way
for
his
account
of
the
conversation
between
fitzgerald
and
bruteman
but
careful
as
he
was
he
noticed
that
her
features
tightened
and
her
hands
were
clenched
when
he
came
to
the
interchange
of
writings
she
sprung
to
her
feet
and
clutching
his
arm
convulsively
exclaimed
did
he
do
that
her
eyes
were
like
a
flame
and
her
chest
heaved
with
the
breath
he
sought
to
draw
her
toward
him
saying
in
soothing
tones
they
shall
not
harm
you
my
poor
girl
trust
to
me
as
if
i
were
your
father
but
she
burst
from
him
impetuously
and
walked
up
and
down
rapidly
such
a
sudden
access
of
strength
had
the
body
received
from
the
frantic
soul
try
not
to
be
so
much
agitated
said
he
in
a
very
short
time
you
will
be
in
europe
and
then
you
will
be
perfectly
safe
she
paused
an
instant
in
her
walk
and
with
a
strange
glare
in
her
eyes
she
hissed
out
i
hate
him
he
laid
his
hand
gently
upon
her
shoulder
and
said
i
want
very
much
that
you
should
try
to
be
calm
some
negroes
are
coming
with
a
boat
at
daybreak
and
it
is
necessary
we
should
all
go
away
with
them
you
ought
to
rest
as
much
as
possible
beforehand
repeated
she
with
bitter
emphasis
and
clenching
her
teeth
hard
she
again
said
i
hate
him
poor
rosa
it
had
taken
a
of
wrong
so
to
crush
out
all
her
gentleness
duroy
became
somewhat
alarmed
he
hastened
to
the
kitchen
and
told
chloe
to
go
directly
to
miss
rosa
he
then
briefly
explained
his
errand
to
tulee
and
told
her
to
prepare
for
departure
as
fast
as
possible
but
first
go
to
your
mistress
said
he
for
i
am
afraid
she
may
go
crazy
the
sufferer
yielded
more
readily
to
tulee
accustomed
influence
than
she
had
done
to
that
of
duroy
she
allowed
herself
to
be
laid
upon
the
bed
but
while
her
forehead
and
temples
were
being
bathed
her
heart
beat
violently
and
all
her
pulses
were
throbbing
it
was
however
necessary
to
leave
her
with
chloe
who
knelt
by
the
bedside
holding
her
hand
and
praying
in
tones
unusually
low
for
her
i
feared
for
her
said
tulee
to
duroy
i
never
see
missy
rosy
look
so
wild
and
strange
a
short
time
after
when
she
looked
into
the
room
rosa
eyes
were
closed
she
whispered
to
chloe
poor
missy
asleep
you
can
come
and
help
me
a
little
now
but
rosa
was
not
in
the
least
drowsy
she
had
only
remained
still
to
avoid
being
talked
to
as
soon
as
her
attendants
had
withdrawn
she
opened
her
eyes
and
turning
toward
the
babes
she
gazed
upon
them
for
a
long
time
there
they
lay
side
by
side
like
twin
kittens
but
ah
thought
she
how
different
is
their
destiny
one
is
born
to
be
cherished
and
waited
upon
all
his
days
the
other
is
an
outcast
and
a
slave
my
poor
fatherless
babe
he
would
manumit
us
it
was
not
thoughtlessness
he
to
sell
us
he
to
sell
us
she
repeated
aloud
and
again
the
wild
hard
look
came
into
her
eyes
such
a
tempest
was
raging
in
her
soul
that
she
felt
as
if
she
could
kill
him
if
he
stood
before
her
this
savage
paroxysm
of
revenge
was
followed
by
thoughts
of
suicide
she
was
about
to
rise
but
hearing
the
approach
of
tulee
she
closed
her
eyes
and
remained
still
language
is
powerless
to
describe
the
anguish
of
that
lacerated
soul
at
last
the
storm
subsided
and
she
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
meanwhile
the
two
black
women
were
busy
with
arrangements
for
the
early
flight
many
things
had
been
already
prepared
with
the
expectation
of
a
summons
to
new
orleans
and
not
long
after
midnight
all
was
in
readiness
chloe
after
a
sound
nap
on
the
kitchen
floor
rose
up
with
the
first
peep
of
light
she
and
tulee
hugged
each
other
with
farewell
kisses
and
sobs
she
knelt
by
rosa
bedside
to
whisper
a
brief
prayer
and
giving
her
one
long
lingering
look
she
took
up
her
baby
and
set
off
for
the
plantation
wondering
at
the
mysterious
ways
of
providence
they
deferred
waking
rosa
as
long
as
possible
and
when
they
roused
her
she
had
been
so
deeply
sunk
in
slumber
that
she
was
at
first
bewildered
when
recollection
returned
she
looked
at
her
babe
where
chloe
she
asked
gone
back
to
the
plantation
was
the
reply
o
i
am
so
sorry
sighed
rosa
she
was
feared
they
would
miss
her
rejoined
tulee
so
she
went
away
as
soon
as
she
could
see
but
she
prayed
for
ye
missy
rosy
and
she
told
me
to
say
poor
chloe
would
never
forget
ye
o
i
sorry
repeated
rosa
mournfully
she
objected
to
taking
the
nourishment
tulee
offered
saying
she
wanted
to
die
but
duroy
reminded
her
that
madame
was
longing
to
see
her
and
she
yielded
to
that
plea
when
tulee
brought
the
same
in
which
she
had
first
come
to
the
cottage
she
shrunk
from
it
at
first
but
seemed
to
remember
immediately
that
she
ought
not
to
give
unnecessary
trouble
to
her
friends
while

was
putting
it
on
tulee
said
i
tried
to
remember
to
put
up
everything
ye
would
want
darling
i
do
want
she
replied
listlessly
then
looking
up
suddenly
with
that
same
wild
hard
expression
she
added
do
let
me
ever
see
anything
that
came
from
she
spoke
so
sternly
that
tulee
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
was
a
little
afraid
of
her
the
eastern
sky
was
all
of
a
saffron
glow
but
the
golden
edge
of
the
sun
had
not
yet
appeared
above
the
horizon
when
they
entered
the
boat
which
was
to
convey
them
to
the
without
one
glance
toward
the
beautiful
island
where
she
had
enjoyed
and
suffered
so
much
the
unhappy
fugitive
nestled
close
to
tulee
and
hid
her
face
on
her
shoulder
as
if
she
had
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
cling
to
a
week
later
a
carriage
stopped
before
madame
door
and
tulee
rushed
in
with
the
baby
on
her
shoulder
exclaiming
while
duroy
was
helping
rosa
to
alight
then
such
huggings
and
kissings
such
showers
of
french
from
madame
and
of
mingled
french
and
italian
from
the
signor
while
tulee
stood
by
throwing
up
her
hand
and
exclaiming
bless
the
lord
bless
the
lord
the
parrot
listened
with
ear
upturned
and
a
lump
of
sugar
in
her
claw
then
overtopped
all
their
voices
with
the
cry
of
jour
rosabella
je
suis
this
produced
a
general
laugh
and
there
was
the
faint
gleam
of
a
smile
on
rosa
face
as
she
looked
up
at
the
cage
and
said
jour
jolie
but
she
soon
sank
into
a
chair
with
an
expression
of
weariness
you
are
tired
darling
said
madame
as
she
took
off
her
bonnet
and
tenderly
put
back
the
straggling
hair
no
wonder
after
all
you
have
gone
through
my
poor
child
rosa
clasped
her
round
the
neck
and
murmured
o
my
dear
friend
i
tired
tired
madame
led
her
to
the
settee
and
arranged
her
head
comfortably
on
its
pillows
then
giving
her
a
motherly
kiss
she
said
rest
darling
while
tulee
and
i
look
after
the
boxes
when
they
had
all
passed
into
another
room
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
exclaimed
how
she
changed
how
thin
and
pale
she
is
how
large
her
eyes
look
but
she
beautiful
as
an
angel
i
never
see
missy
rosy
but
once
when
she
was
beautiful
as
an
angel
said
tulee
and
that
was
the
night
massa
duroy
told
her
she
was
sold
to
massa
bruteman
then
she
looked
as
if
she
had
as
many
devils
as
that
mary
magdalene
massa
royal
used
to
read
about
sundays
no
wonder
poor
child
exclaimed
madame
but
i
hope
the
little
one
is
some
comfort
to
her
she
taken
much
notice
of
him
or
anything
else
since
massa
duroy
told
her
that
news
rejoined
tulee
madame
took
the
baby
and
tried
to
look
into
its
face
as
well
as
the
lopping
motions
of
its
little
head
would
permit
i
should
think
she
have
much
comfort
in
looking
at
it
said
she
for
it
the
image
of
its
father
but
the
poor
little
dear
ai
to
blame
for
that
an
animated
conversation
followed
concerning
what
had
happened
since
tulee
went
away
especially
the
disappearance
of
flora
both
hinted
at
having
entertained
similar
suspicions
but
both
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
could
not
be
alive
or
she
would
have
written
rosa
meanwhile
left
alone
in
the
little
parlor
where
she
had
listened
so
anxiously
for
the
whistling
of

scarcely
conscious
of
any
other
sensation
than
the
luxury
of
repose
after
extreme
fatigue
of
body
and
mind
there
was
indeed
something
pleasant
in
the
familiar
surroundings
the
parrot
swung
in
the
same
gilded
ring
in
her
cage
madame
table
with
its
basket
of
chenilles
stood
in
the
same
place
and
by
it
was
her
enamelled
snuffbox
rosa
recognized
a
few
articles
that
had
been
purchased
at
the
auction
of
her
father
furniture
his
and
the
astral
lamp
by
which
he
used
to
sit
to
read
his
newspaper
a
that
was
her
mother
and
one
of
flora
embroidered
slippers
hung
up
for
a
with
these
memories
floating
before
her
drowsy
eyes
she
fell
asleep
and
slept
for
a
long
time
as
her
slumbers
grew
lighter
dreams
of
father
mother
and
sister
passed
through
various
changes
the
last
of
which
was
that
flora
was
puzzling
the
she
waked
to
the
consciousness
that
some
one
was
whistling
in
the
room
who
is
that
exclaimed
she
and
the
parrot
replied
with
a
tempest
of
imitations
madame
hearing
the
noise
came
in
saying
how
stupid
i
was
not
to
cover
the
cage
she
is
noisy
her
memory
is
wonderful
i
do
think
she
ever
forget
a
note
of
all
the
dear
floracita
took
so
much
pains
to
teach
her
she
began
to
call
up
reminiscences
of
flora
incessant
mischief
but
finding
rosa
in
no
mood
for
anything
gay
she
proceeded
to
talk
over
the
difficulties
of
her
position
concluding
with
the
remark
and
you
must
rest
my
child
but
early
you
and
the
signor
will
start
for
new
york
whence
you
will
take
passage
to
marseilles
under
the
name
of
signor
balbino
and
daughter
i
wish
i
could
stay
here
at
least
for
a
little
while
sighed
rosa
it
never
wise
to
wish
for
what
can
not
be
had
rejoined
madame
it
would
cause
great
trouble
and
expense
to
obtain
your
freedom
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
we
could
secure
it
at
all
for
bruteman
wo
give
you
up
if
he
can
avoid
it
the
voyage
will
recruit
your
strength
and
it
will
do
you
good
to
be
far
away
from
anything
that
reminds
you
of
old
troubles
i
have
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
dispose
of
my
furniture
and
settle
about
the
lease
of
this
house
you
will
wait
at
marseilles
for
me
i
shall
be
uneasy
till
i
have
the
sea
between
me
and
the
agents
of
bruteman
and
i
shall
hurry
to
follow
after
you
as
soon
as
possible
and
tulee
and
the
baby
asked
rosa
yes
with
tulee
and
the
baby
replied
madame
but
i
shall
send
them
to
my
cousin
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
being
seen
by
the
neighbors
he
lives
off
the
road
and
three
miles
out
they
be
nicely
out
of
the
way
there
it
was
all
accomplished
as
the
energetic
frenchwoman
had
planned
rosa
was
whirled
away
without
time
to
think
of
anything
at
parting
she
embraced
tulee
and
looked
earnestly
in
the
baby
face
while
she
stroked
his
shining
black
hair
good
by
dear
kind
tulee
said
she
take
good
care
of
the
little
one
at
philadelphia
her
strength
broke
down
and
they
were
detained
three
days
consequently
when
they
arrived
in
new
york
they
found
that
the
mermaid
in
which
they
expected
to
take
passage
had
sailed
the
signor
considered
it
imprudent
to
correspond
with
his
wife
on
the
subject
and
concluded
to
go
out
of
the
city
and
wait
for
the
next
vessel
when
they
went
on
board
they
found
madame
and
explained
to
her
the
circumstances
i
am
glad
i
did
know
of
the
delay
said
she
for
i
was
frightened
enough
as
it
was
but
luckily
i
got
off
without
coming
to
make
inquiries
but
where
are
tulee
and
the
baby
are
they
down
below
asked
rosa
no
dear
i
did
bring
them
o
how
came
you
to
leave
them
said
rosa
something
will
happen
to
them
i
have
provided
well
for
their
safety
rejoined
madame
the
reason
i
did
it
was
this
we
have
no
certain
home
or
prospects
at
present
and
i
thought
we
had
better
be
settled
somewhere
before
the
baby
was
brought
my
cousin
is
coming
to
marseilles
in
about
three
months
and
he
will
bring
them
with
him
his
wife
was
glad
to
give
tulee
her
board
meanwhile
for
what
work
she
could
do
i
really
think
it
was
best
dear
the
feeble
little
thing
will
be
stronger
for
the
voyage
by
that
time
and
you
know
tulee
will
take
just
as
good
care
of
it
as
if
it
were
her
own
poor
tulee
sighed
rosa
was
she
willing
to
be
left
she
did
know
when
i
came
away
replied
madame
rosa
heaved
an
audible
groan
as
she
said
i
am
so
sorry
you
did
this
madame
if
anything
should
happen
to
them
it
would
be
a
weight
on
my
mind
as
long
as
i
live
i
did
what
i
thought
was
for
the
best
answered
madame
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
on
your
account
that
if
i
had
all
my
wits
about
me
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
but
i
think
myself
i
made
the
best
arrangement
rosa
perceiving
a
slight
indication
of
pique
in
her
tone
hastened
to
kiss
her
and
call
her
her
best
and
dearest
friend
but
in
her
heart
she
mourned
over
what
she
considered
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
a
great
mistake
in
the
management
of
madame
after
tom
return
from
new
orleans
he
continued
to
go
to
the
cottage
as
usual
and
so
long
as
no
questions
were
asked
he
said
nothing
but
when
his
master
inquired
how
they
were
getting
on
there
he
answered
that
missy
rosy
was
better
when
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
he
thought
the
fugitives
must
be
out
of
harm
way
and
he
feared
bruteman
might
be
coming
soon
to
claim
his
purchase
accordingly
he
one
day
informed
his
master
with
a
great
appearance
of
astonishment
and
alarm
that
the
cottage
was
shut
up
and
all
the
inmates
gone
fitzgerald
first
feeling
was
joy
for
he
was
glad
to
be
relieved
from
the
picture
of
rosa
horror
and
despair
which
had
oppressed
him
like
the
nightmare
but
he
foresaw
that
bruteman
would
suspect
him
of
having
forewarned
her
though
he
had
solemnly
pledged
himself
not
to
do
so
he
immediately
wrote
him
the
tidings
with
expressions
of
surprise
and
regret
the
answer
he
received
led
to
a
duel
in
which
he
received
a
wound
in
the
shoulder
that
his
wife
always
supposed
was
occasioned
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
when
bruteman
ascertained
that
madame
and
the
signor
had
left
the
country
he
at
once
conjectured
that
the
fugitive
was
with
them
having
heard
that
duroy
was
a
relative
he
waited
upon
him
at
his
place
of
business
and
was
informed
that
rosabella
royal
had
sailed
for
france
with
his
cousin
in
the
ship
mermaid
not
long
after
it
was
stated
in
the
ship
news
that
the
mermaid
had
foundered
at
sea
and
all
on
board
were
lost
chapter
xvii
while
rosabella
had
been
passing
through
these
dark
experiences
flora
was
becoming
more
and
more
accustomed
to
her
new
situation
she
strove
bravely
to
conceal
the
homesickness
which
she
could
not
always
conquer
but
several
times
in
the
course
of
their
travels
delano
noticed
moisture
gathering
on
her
long
black
eyelashes
when
she
saw
the
stars
and
stripes
floating
from
the
mast
of
a
vessel
once
when
a
rose
was
given
her
she
wept
outright
but
she
soon
wiped
her
eyes
and
apologized
by
saying
i
wonder
whether
a
makes
rosa
feel
as
i
do
when
i
see
a
rose
but
what
an
ungrateful
child
i
am
when
i
have
such
a
dear
kind
new
mamita
and
a
loving
smile
again
lighted
up
her
swimming
eyes
those
beautiful
april
eyes
of
tears
and
sunshine
that
made
rainbows
in
the
heart
delano
wisely
kept
her
occupied
with
a
succession
of
teachers
and
daily
excursions
having
a
natural
genius
for
music
and
drawing
she
made
rapid
progress
in
both
during
a
residence
of
six
months
in
england
six
months
in
france
and
three
months
in
switzerland
and
as
and
percival
were
usually
with
them
she
picked
up
in
her
quick
way
a
good
degree
of
culture
from
the
daily
tone
of
conversation
the
one
drawback
to
the
pleasure
of
new
acquisitions
was
that
she
could
not
share
them
with
rosa
one
day
when
she
was
saying
this
delano
replied
we
will
go
to
italy
for
a
short
time
and
then
we
will
return
to
live
in
boston
i
have
talked
the
matter
over
a
good
deal
with
percival
and
i
think
i
should
know
how
to
guard
against
any
contingency
that
may
occur
and
as
you
are
so
anxious
about
your
sister
i
have
been
revolving
plans
for
taking
you
back
to
the
island
to
see
whether
we
can
ascertain
what
is
going
on
in
that
mysterious
cottage
from
that
time
there
was
a
very
perceptible
increase
of
cheerfulness
in
flora
spirits
the
romance
of
such
an
adventure
hit
her
youthful
fancy
while
the
idea
of
getting
even
a
sly
peep
at
rosa
filled
her
with
delight
she
imagined
all
sorts
of
plans
to
accomplish
this
object
and
often
held
discussions
upon
the
propriety
of
admitting
tulee
to
their
confidence
her
vivacity
redoubled
when
they
entered
italy
she
was
herself
composed
of
the
same
materials
of
which
italy
was
made
and
without
being
aware
of
the
spiritual
relationship
she
at
once
felt
at
home
there
she
was
charmed
with
the
gay
impulsive
people
the
bright
costumes
the
impassioned
music
and
the
flowing
language
the
clear
intense
blue
of
the
noonday
sky
and
the
sun
setting
in
a
glowing
sea
of
amber
reminded
her
of
her
southern
home
and
the
fragrance
of
the
was
as
incense
waved
by
the
memory
of
her
childhood
the
ruins
of
rome
interested
her
less
than
any
other
features
of
the
landscape
for
like
bettini
she
never
asked
who
any
of
the
ancients
were
for
fear
they
would
tell
her
the
play
of
sunshine
on
the
lichens
interested
her
more
than
the
inscriptions
they
covered
and
while
their
guide
was
telling
the
story
of
mouldering
arches
she
was
looking
through
them
at
the
clear
blue
sky
and
the
soft
outline
of
the
hills
one
morning
they
rode
out
early
to
spend
a
whole
day
at
albano
and
every
mile
of
the
ride
presented
her
with
some
charming
novelty
the
peasants
who
went
dancing
by
in
picturesque
costumes
and
the
finely
formed
women
walking
erect
with
vases
of
water
on
their
heads
or
drawing
an
even
thread
from
their
distaffs
as
they
went
singing
along
furnished
her
memory
with
subjects
for
many
a
picture
sometimes
her
exclamations
would
attract
the
attention
of
a
group
of
dancers
who
pleased
with
an
exuberance
of
spirits
akin
to
their
own
and
not
unmindful
of
forthcoming
coin
would
beckon
to
the
driver
to
stop
while
they
repeated
their
dances
for
the
amusement
of
the
signorina
a
succession
of
pleasant
novelties
awaited
her
at
albano
running
about
among
the
in
search
of
bright
mosses
she
would
come
suddenly
in
front
of
an
elegant
villa
with
garlands
in
stucco
and
balconies
gracefully
draped
with
vines
wandering
away
from
that
she
would
utter
a
little
cry
of
joy
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
some
reclining
marble
nymph
over
which
a
little
fountain
threw
a
transparent
veil
of
gossamer
sparkling
with
diamonds
sometimes
she
stood
listening
to
the
gurgling
and
dripping
of
unseen
waters
and
sometimes
melodies
floated
from
the
distance
which
her
quick
ear
caught
at
once
and
her
tuneful
voice
repeated
like
a
the
childlike
zest
with
which
she
entered
into
everything
and
made
herself
a
part
of
everything
amused
her
quiet
friend
and
gave
her
even
more
pleasure
than
the
beauties
of
the
landscape
after
a
picnic
repast
they
ascended
monte
cavo
and
looked
down
on
the
deep
basins
of
the
lakes
once
blazing
with
volcanic
fire
now
full
of
water
blue
as
the
sky
it
reflected
like
human
souls
in
which
the
passions
have
burned
out
and
left
them
calm
recipients
of
those
divine
truths
in
which
the
heavens
are
mirrored
as
delano
pointed
out
various
features
in
the
magnificent
panorama
around
them
she
began
to
tell
flora
of
scenes
in
the
aeneid
with
which
they
were
intimately
connected
the
young
girl
who
was
serious
for
the
moment
dropped
on
the
grass
to
listen
with
elbows
on
her
friend
lap
and
her
upturned
face
supported
by
her
hands
but
the
lecture
was
too
grave
for
her
mercurial
spirit
and
she
soon
sprang
up
exclaiming
o
mamita
lila
all
those
people
were
dead
and
buried
so
long
ago
i
do
believe
the
princess
that
aeneas
was
fighting
about
was
half
as
handsome
as
that
dancing
contadina
from
frascati
with
a
scarlet
bodice
and
a
floating
veil
fastened
among
her
black
braids
with
a
silver
arrow
how
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
cheeks
glowed
and
the
contadino
who
was
dancing
with
her
with
those
long
streamers
of
red
ribbon
flying
round
his
peaked
hat
he
looked
almost
as
handsome
as
she
did
how
i
wish
i
could
see
them
dance
the
saltarello
again
o
mamita
lila
as
soon
as
we
get
back
to
rome
do
buy
a
tambourine
inspired
by
the
remembrance
she
straightway
began
to
hum
the
monotonous
tune
of
that
grasshopper
dance
imitating
the
hopping
steps
and
the
quick
jerks
of
the
arms
marking
the
time
with
rapidity
on
her
left
hand
as
if
it
were
a
tambourine
she
was
so
aglow
with
the
exercise
and
so
graceful
in
her
swift
motions
that
delano
watched
her
with
admiring
smiles
but
when
the
extempore
entertainment
came
to
a
close
she
thought
to
herself
it
is
a
hopeless
undertaking
to
educate
her
after
the
new
england
pattern
one
might
as
well
try
to
plough
with
a
butterfly
as
to
teach
her
ancient
history
when
they
had
wandered
about
a
little
while
longer
happy
as
souls
newly
arrived
in
the
elysian
fields
delano
said
my
child
you
have
already
gathered
mosses
enough
to
fill
the
carriage
and
it
is
time
for
us
to
return
you
know
twilight
passes
into
darkness
very
quickly
here
just
let
me
gather
this
piece
of
golden
lichen
pleaded
she
it
will
look
so
pretty
among
the
green
moss
in
the
cross
i
am
going
to
make
you
for
christmas
when
all
her
multifarious
gleanings
were
gathered
up
they
lingered
a
little
to
drink
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
them
in
the
distance
was
the
eternal
city
girdled
by
hills
that
stood
out
with
wonderful
distinctness
in
the
luminous
atmosphere
of
that
brilliant
day
which
threw
a
golden
veil
over
all
its
churches
statues
and
ruins
before
they
had
gone
far
on
their
homeward
ride
all
things
passed
through
magical
changes
the
hills
were
seen
in
vapory
visions
shifting
their
hues
with
opaline
glances
and
over
the
green
billowy
surface
of
the
broad
campagna
was
settling
a
prismatic
robe
of
mist
changing
from
rose
to
violet
earth
seemed
to
be
writing
in
colored
notes
with
tenderest
modulations
her
farewell
hymn
to
the
departing
god
of
light
and
the
visible
music
soon
took
voice
in
the
vibration
of
in
the
midst
of
which
they
entered
rome
flora
who
was
sobered
by
the
solemn
sounds
and
the
darkening
landscape
scarcely
spoke
except
to
remind
delano
of
the
tambourine
as
they
drove
through
the
crowded
corso
and
when
they
entered
their
lodgings
in
via
delle
quattro
fontane
she
passed
to
her
room
without
any
of
her
usual
skipping
and
singing
when
they
met
again
at
supper
her
friend
said
why
so
serious
is
my
little
one
tired
i
have
been
thinking
mamita
that
something
is
going
to
happen
to
me
she
replied
for
always
when
i
am
very
merry
something
happens
i
should
think
something
would
happen
very
often
then
rejoined
delano
with
a
smile
to
which
she
responded
with
her
ready
little
laugh
several
visitors
called
while
we
were
gone
said
delano
our
rich
boston
friend
green
has
left
his
card
he
follows
us
very
diligently
she
looked
at
flora
as
she
spoke
but
though
the
light
from
a
tall
lamp
fell
directly
on
her
face
she
saw
no
emotion
either
of
pleasure
or
embarrassment
she
merely
looked
up
with
a
smile
as
she
remarked
he
always
seems
to
be
going
round
very
leisurely
in
search
of
something
to
entertain
him
i
wonder
whether
he
has
found
it
yet
though
she
was
really
tired
with
the
exertions
of
the
day
the
sight
of
the
new
tambourine
after
supper
proved
too
tempting
and
she
was
soon
practising
the
saltarello
again
with
an
agility
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
nimble
contadina
from
whom
she
had
learned
it
she
was
whirling
round
more
and
more
swiftly
as
if
fatigue
were
a
thing
impossible
to
her
when
green
was
announced
and
a
very
stylishly
dressed
gentleman
with
glossy
and
diamond
studs
entered
the
room
she
had
had
scarcely
time
to
seat
herself
and
her
face
was
still
flushed
with
exercise
while
her
dimples
were
revealed
by
a
sort
of
shy
smile
at
the
consciousness
of
having
been
so
nearly
caught
in
her
rompish
play
by
such
an
exquisite
the
glowing
cheek
and
the
dimpling
smile
were
a
new
revelation
to
green
for
he
had
never
interested
her
sufficiently
to
call
out
the
vivacity
which
rendered
her
so
charming
delano
noticed
his
glance
of
admiration
and
the
thought
occurred
as
it
had
often
done
before
what
an
embarrassing
dilemma
she
would
be
in
if
he
should
propose
marriage
to
her
i
called
this
morning
said
he
and
found
you
had
gone
to
albano
i
was
tempted
to
follow
but
thought
it
likely
i
should
miss
you
it
is
a
charming
drive
everything
is
charming
here
i
think
rejoined
flora
ah
it
is
the
first
time
you
have
seen
rome
said
he
i
envy
you
the
freshness
of
your
sensations
this
is
the
third
time
i
have
been
here
and
of
course
it
palls
a
little
upon
me
why
do
you
go
to
some
new
place
then
inquired
flora
where
there
any
new
place
responded
he
languidly
to
be
sure
there
is
arabia
petraea
but
the
accommodations
are
not
good
besides
rome
has
attractions
for
me
at
present
and
i
really
think
i
meet
more
acquaintances
here
than
i
should
at
home
rome
is
beginning
to
swarm
with
americans
especially
with
southerners
one
can
usually
recognize
them
at
a
glance
by
their
unmistakable
air
of
distinction
they
are
obviously
of
porcelain
clay
as
willis
says
i
think
our
new
england
percival
is
as
polished
a
gentleman
as
any
i
have
seen
observed
delano
he
is
a
gentleman
in
manners
and
attainments
i
admit
replied
green
but
with
his
family
and
education
what
a
pity
it
is
he
has
so
disgraced
himself
pray
what
has
he
done
inquired
the
lady
did
you
know
he
was
an
abolitionist
rejoined
green
it
is
a
fact
that
he
has
actually
spoken
at
their
meetings
i
was
surprised
to
see
him
travelling
with
you
in
england
it
must
be
peculiarly
irritating
to
the
south
to
see
a
man
of
his
position
siding
with
those
vulgar
agitators
really
unless
something
effectual
can
be
done
to
stop
that
frenzy
i
fear
southern
gentlemen
will
be
unable
to
recover
a
fugitive
slave
flora
looked
at
delano
with
a
furtive
sideway
glance
and
a
on
her
lips
her
impulse
was
to
jump
up
dot
one
of
her
quick
courtesies
and
say
i
am
a
fugitive
slave
please
sir
give
up
to
any
of
those
distinguished
gentlemen
green
noticed
her
glance
and
mistook
it
for
distaste
of
his
theme
pardon
me
ladies
said
he
for
introducing
a
subject
tabooed
in
polite
society
i
called
for
a
very
different
purpose
one
novelty
remains
for
me
in
rome
i
have
never
seen
the
statues
of
the
vatican
by
torchlight
some
americans
are
forming
a
party
for
that
purpose
evening
and
if
you
would
like
to
join
them
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
to
be
your
escort
flora
being
appealed
to
expressed
acquiescence
and
delano
replied
we
will
accept
your
invitation
with
pleasure
i
have
a
great
predilection
for
sculpture
finding
myself
so
fortunate
in
one
request
encourages
me
to
make
another
rejoined
green
on
the
evening
following
norma
is
to
be
brought
out
with
a
new
from
whom
great
things
are
expected
i
should
be
much
gratified
if
you
would
allow
me
to
procure
tickets
and
attend
upon
you
flora
face
lighted
up
at
once
i
see
what
my
musical
daughter
wishes
said
delano
we
will
therefore
lay
ourselves
under
obligations
to
you
for
two
evenings
entertainment
the
gentleman
having
expressed
his
thanks
bade
them
good
evening
flora
woke
up
the
next
morning
full
of
pleasant
anticipations
when
delano
looked
in
upon
her
she
found
her
already
dressed
and
busy
with
a
sketch
of
the
dancing
couple
from
frascati
i
can
not
make
them
so
much
alive
as
i
wish
said
she
because
they
are
not
in
motion
no
picture
can
give
the
gleamings
of
the
arrow
or
the
whirlings
of
the
veil
i
wish
we
could
dress
like
italians
how
i
should
like
to
wear
a
scarlet
bodice
and
a
veil
fastened
with
a
silver
arrow
if
we
remained
till
carnival
you
might
have
that
pleasure
replied
delano
for
everybody
masquerades
as
they
like
at
that
time
but
i
imagine
you
would
hardly
fancy
my
appearance
in
scarlet
jacket
with
laced
sleeves
big
coral
necklace
and
long
like
that
old
contadina
we
met
riding
on
a
donkey
flora
laughed
to
think
of
mamita
lila
in
such
costume
exclaimed
she
the
old
contadina
would
make
a
charming
picture
but
a
picture
of
the
campagna
sleepy
with
purple
haze
would
be
more
like
you
am
i
then
so
sleepy
inquired
her
friend
o
no
not
sleepy
you
know
i
do
mean
that
but
so
quiet
and
always
with
some
sort
of
violet
or
lilac
cloud
for
a
dress
but
here
comes
carlina
to
call
us
to
breakfast
said
she
as
she
laid
down
her
crayon
and
drummed
the
saltarello
on
her
picture
while
she
paused
a
moment
to
look
at
it
as
delano
wished
to
write
letters
and
flora
expected
a
teacher
in
drawing
it
was
decided
that
they
should
remain
at
home
until
the
hour
arrived
for
visiting
the
vatican
we
have
been
about
so
much
said
delano
that
i
think
it
will
be
pleasant
to
have
a
quiet
day
flora
assented
but
as
delano
wrote
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
her
ideas
of
quietude
sometimes
rapid
thumps
on
the
tambourine
might
be
heard
indicating
that
the
saltarello
was
again
in
rehearsal
if
a
strolled
through
the
street
the
monotonous
drone
of
his
bagpipe
was
reproduced
in
most
comical
imitation
and
anon
there
was
a
gush
of
as
if
a
whole
aviary
were
in
the
vicinity
indeed
no
passed
without
audible
indication
that
the
little
recluse
was
in
merry
mood
at
the
appointed
time
green
came
to
conduct
them
to
the
vatican
they
ascended
the
wide
slopes
and
passed
through
open
courts
into
long
passages
lined
with
statues
and
very
dimly
lighted
with
occasional
lamps
here
and
there
a
marble
figure
was
half
revealed
and
looked
so
spectral
in
the
gloaming
that
they
felt
as
if
they
were
entering
the
world
of
spirits
several
members
of
the
party
preceded
them
and
all
seemed
to
feel
the
hushing
influence
for
they
passed
on
in
silence
and
stepped
softly
as
they
entered
the
great
palace
of
art
the
were
soon
in
readiness
to
illuminate
the
statues
which
they
did
by
holding
a
covered
light
over
each
making
it
stand
out
alone
in
the
surrounding
darkness
with
very
striking
effects
of
light
and
shadow
flora
who
was
crouched
on
a
low
seat
by
the
side
of
delano
gazed
with
a
reverent
feeling
on
the
thoughtful
majestic
looking
minerva
medica
when
the
graceful
vision
of
venus
anadyomene
was
revealed
she
pressed
her
hand
and
the
pressure
was
returned
but
when
the
light
was
held
over
a
beautiful
cupid
the
face
looked
out
from
the
gloom
with
such
an
earnest
childlike
expression
that
she
forgot
the
presence
of
strangers
and
impulsively
exclaimed
o
mamita
how
lovely
a
gentleman
some
little
distance
in
front
of
them
turned
toward
them
suddenly
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
a
movement
of
the
threw
the
light
full
upon
him
for
an
instant
flora
hid
her
face
in
the
lap
of
delano
who
attributed
the
quick
action
to
her
shame
at
having
spoken
so
audibly
but
placing
her
hand
caressingly
on
her
shoulder
she
felt
that
she
was
trembling
violently
she
stooped
toward
her
and
softly
inquired
what
is
the
matter
dear
flora
seized
her
head
with
both
hands
and
drawing
it
closer
whispered
take
me
home
mamita
do
take
me
right
home
wondering
what
sudden
caprice
had
seized
the
emotional
child
she
said
why
are
you
ill
dear
flora
whispered
close
into
her
ear
no
mamita
but
fitzgerald
is
here
delano
rose
very
quietly
and
approaching
green
said
my
daughter
is
not
well
and
we
wish
to
leave
but
i
beg
you
will
return
as
soon
as
you
have
conducted
us
to
the
carriage
but
though
he
was
assured
by
both
the
ladies
that
nothing
alarming
was
the
matter
when
they
arrived
at
their
lodgings
he
descended
from
the
driver
seat
to
assist
them
in
alighting
delano
with
polite
regrets
at
having
thus
disturbed
his
pleasure
thanked
him
and
bade
him
good
evening
she
hurried
after
flora
whom
she
found
in
her
room
weeping
bitterly
control
your
feelings
my
child
said
she
you
are
perfectly
safe
here
in
italy
but
if
he
saw
me
it
will
make
it
so
very
unpleasant
for
you
mamita
he
could
see
you
for
we
were
sitting
in
very
deep
shadow
replied
delano
but
even
if
he
had
seen
you
i
should
know
how
to
protect
you
but
what
i
am
thinking
of
said
floracita
still
weeping
is
that
he
may
have
brought
rosa
with
him
and
i
ca
run
to
her
this
very
minute
i
see
her
i
see
her
if
i
have
to
tell
ever
so
many
about
the
reason
of
my
running
away
i
would
prepare
any
at
present
rejoined
delano
i
always
prefer
the
truth
i
will
send
for
percival
and
ask
him
to
ascertain
whether
fitzgerald
brought
a
lady
with
him
meanwhile
you
had
better
lie
down
and
keep
as
quiet
as
you
can
as
soon
as
i
obtain
any
information
i
will
come
and
tell
you
when
percival
was
informed
of
the
adventure
at
the
vatican
he
sallied
forth
to
examine
the
lists
of
arrivals
and
before
long
he
returned
with
the
statement
that
and
fitzgerald
were
registered
among
the
newcomers
flora
would
of
course
consider
that
conclusive
said
he
but
you
and
i
who
have
doubts
concerning
that
clandestine
marriage
will
deem
it
prudent
to
examine
further
if
it
should
prove
to
be
her
sister
it
will
be
a
very
embarrassing
affair
rejoined
delano
percival
thought
it
very
unlikely
but
said
he
would
ascertain
particulars
with
that
general
promise
without
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
already
discovered
flora
retired
to
rest
but
it
was
nearly
morning
before
she
slept
chapter
xviii
though
flora
had
been
so
wakeful
the
preceding
night
she
tapped
at
delano
door
very
early
the
next
morning
excuse
me
for
coming
before
you
were
dressed
said
she
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
how
long
you
think
it
will
be
before
percival
can
find
out
whether
fitzgerald
has
brought
rosa
with
him
probably
not
before
noon
replied
delano
drawing
the
anxious
little
face
toward
her
and
imprinting
on
it
her
morning
kiss
last
evening
i
wrote
a
note
to
green
requesting
him
to
dispose
of
the
opera
tickets
to
other
friends
fitzgerald
is
so
musical
he
will
of
course
be
there
and
whether
your
sister
is
with
him
or
not
you
will
be
in
too
nervous
a
state
to
go
to
any
public
place
you
had
better
stay
in
your
room
and
busy
yourself
with
books
and
drawings
till
we
can
ascertain
the
state
of
things
i
will
sit
with
you
as
much
as
i
can
and
when
i
am
absent
you
must
try
to
be
a
good
quiet
child
i
will
try
to
be
good
because
i
do
want
to
trouble
you
mamita
lila
but
you
know
i
ca
be
quiet
in
my
mind
i
did
long
for
the
opera
but
unless
fitzgerald
brought
rosa
with
him
and
i
could
see
her
before
i
went
it
would
almost
kill
me
to
hear
norma
for
every
part
of
it
is
associated
with
her
after
breakfast
delano
sat
some
time
in
flora
room
inspecting
her
recent
drawings
and
advising
her
to
work
upon
them
during
the
day
as
the
best
method
of
restraining
restlessness
while
they
were
thus
occupied
carlina
brought
in
a
beautiful
bouquet
for
miss
delano
accompanied
with
a
note
for
the
elder
lady
expressing
great
regret
at
being
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
their
company
for
the
evening
i
am
sorry
i
missed
seeing
him
thought
delano
for
he
is
always
so
intimate
with
southerners
i
dare
say
he
would
know
all
about
fitzgerald
though
i
should
have
been
at
a
loss
how
to
introduce
the
inquiry
not
long
afterward
percival
called
and
had
what
seemed
to
flora
a
very
long
private
conference
with
delano
the
information
he
brought
was
that
the
lady
with
fitzgerald
was
a
small
slight
figure
with
yellowish
hair
and
very
delicate
complexion
that
is
in
all
respects
the
very
opposite
of
flora
description
of
her
sister
rejoined
delano
their
brief
conversation
on
the
subject
was
concluded
by
a
request
that
percival
would
inquire
at
civita
vecchia
for
the
earliest
vessels
bound
either
to
france
or
england
delano
could
not
at
once
summon
sufficient
resolution
to
recount
all
the
particulars
to
flora
to
whom
she
merely
said
that
she
considered
it
certain
that
her
sister
was
not
with
fitzgerald
then
why
ca
i
go
right
off
to
the
united
states
exclaimed
the
impetuous
little
damsel
would
you
then
leave
mamita
lila
so
suddenly
inquired
her
friend
whereupon
the
emotional
child
began
to
weep
and
protest
this
little
scene
was
interrupted
by
carlina
with
two
on
a
silver
salver
delano
face
flushed
unusually
as
she
glanced
at
them
she
immediately
rose
to
go
saying
to
flora
i
must
see
these
people
but
i
will
come
back
to
you
as
soon
as
i
can
do
leave
your
room
my
dear
in
the
parlor
she
found
a
gentleman
and
lady
both
handsome
but
as
different
from
each
other
as
night
and
morning
the
lady
stepped
forward
and
said
i
think
you
will
recollect
me
for
we
lived
in
the
same
street
in
boston
and
you
and
my
mother
used
to
visit
together
miss
lily
bell
rejoined
delano
offering
her
hand
i
had
not
heard
you
were
on
this
side
the
atlantic
not
miss
bell
now
but
fitzgerald
replied
the
fair
little
lady
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
mr
fitzgerald
delano
bowed
rather
coldly
and
her
visitor
continued
i
was
so
sorry
i
did
know
you
were
with
the
vatican
party
last
night
green
told
us
of
it
this
morning
and
said
you
were
obliged
to
leave
early
on
account
of
the
indisposition
of
miss
delano
i
hope
she
has
recovered
for
green
has
told
me
so
much
about
her
that
i
am
dying
with
curiosity
to
see
her
she
is
better
i
thank
you
but
not
well
enough
to
see
company
replied
delano
what
a
pity
she
will
be
obliged
to
relinquish
the
opera
observed
fitzgerald
i
hear
she
is
very
musical
and
they
tell
wonderful
stories
about
this
new
they
say
she
has
two
more
notes
in
the
altissimo
scale
than
any
singer
who
has
been
heard
here
and
that
her
sostenuto
is
absolutely
marvellous
delano
replied
politely
expressing
regret
that
she
and
her
daughter
were
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
hearing
such
a
musical
genius
after
some
desultory
chat
concerning
the
various
sights
in
rome
the
visitors
departed
i
glad
your
call
was
short
said
fitzgerald
that
lady
is
a
perfect
specimen
of
boston
ice
whereupon
his
companion
began
to
rally
him
for
want
of
gallantry
in
saying
anything
disparaging
of
boston
meanwhile
delano
was
pacing
the
parlor
in
a
disturbed
state
of
mind
though
she
had
foreseen
such
a
contingency
as
one
of
the
possible
consequences
of
adopting
flora
yet
when
it
came
so
suddenly
in
a
different
place
and
under
different
circumstances
from
any
she
had
thought
of
the
effect
was
somewhat
bewildering
she
dreaded
the
agitation
into
which
the
news
would
throw
flora
and
she
wanted
to
mature
her
own
future
plans
before
she
made
the
announcement
so
in
answer
to
flora
questions
about
the
visitors
she
merely
said
a
lady
from
boston
the
daughter
of
one
of
her
old
acquaintances
had
called
to
introduce
her
husband
after
dinner
they
spent
some
time
reading
tasso
aminta
together
and
then
delano
said
i
wish
to
go
and
have
a
talk
with
and
percival
i
have
asked
him
to
inquire
about
vessels
at
civita
vecchia
for
under
present
circumstances
i
presume
you
would
be
glad
to
set
out
sooner
than
we
intended
on
that
romantic
expedition
in
search
of
your
sister
o
thank
you
thank
you
exclaimed
flora
jumping
up
and
kissing
her
i
trust
you
will
not
go
out
or
sing
or
show
yourself
at
the
windows
while
i
am
gone
said
delano
for
though
fitzgerald
can
do
you
no
possible
harm
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
slip
away
without
his
seeing
you
the
promise
was
readily
and
earnestly
given
and
she
proceeded
to
the
lodgings
of
and
percival
in
the
next
street
after
she
had
related
the
experiences
of
the
morning
she
asked
what
they
supposed
had
become
of
rosabella
it
is
to
be
hoped
she
does
not
continue
her
relation
with
that
base
man
if
she
knows
of
his
marriage
said
percival
for
that
would
involve
a
moral
degradation
painful
for
you
to
think
of
in
sister
if
she
has
ceased
to
interest
his
fancy
very
likely
he
may
have
sold
her
said
percival
for
a
man
who
could
entertain
the
idea
of
selling
flora
i
think
would
sell
his
own
northern
wife
if
the
law
permitted
it
and
circumstances
tempted
him
to
it
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
in
the
premises
inquired
delano
i
would
hardly
presume
to
say
what
you
ought
to
do
rejoined
percival
but
i
know
what
i
should
do
if
i
were
as
rich
as
you
and
as
strongly
attached
to
flora
let
me
hear
what
you
would
do
said
delano
the
prompt
reply
was
i
would
go
in
search
of
her
and
if
she
was
sold
i
would
buy
her
and
bring
her
home
and
be
a
mother
to
her
thank
you
said
delano
warmly
pressing
her
hand
i
thought
you
would
advise
what
was
kindest
and
noblest
money
really
seems
to
me
of
very
little
value
except
as
a
means
of
promoting
human
happiness
and
in
this
case
i
might
perhaps
prevent
moral
degradation
growing
out
of
misfortune
and
despair
after
some
conversation
concerning
vessels
that
were
about
to
sail
the
friends
parted
on
her
way
homeward
she
wondered
within
herself
whether
they
had
any
suspicion
of
the
secret
tie
that
bound
her
so
closely
to
these
unfortunate
girls
i
ought
to
do
the
same
for
them
without
that
motive
thought
she
but
should
i
though
her
call
had
not
been
very
long
it
seemed
so
to
flora
who
had
latterly
been
little
accustomed
to
solitude
she
had
no
heart
for
books
or
drawing
she
sat
listlessly
watching
the
crowd
on
monte
pincio
children
chasing
each
other
or
toddling
about
with
nurses
in
jackets
carriages
going
round
and
round
ever
and
anon
bringing
into
the
sunshine
gleams
of
gay
roman
scarfs
or
bright
autumnal
ribbons
fluttering
in
the
breeze
she
had
enjoyed
few
things
more
than
joining
that
fashionable
promenade
to
overlook
the
city
in
the
changing
glories
of
sunset
but
now
she
cared
not
for
it
her
thoughts
were
far
away
on
the
lonely
island
as
sunset
quickly
faded
into
twilight
carriages
and
pedestrians
wound
their
way
down
the
hill
the
noble
trees
on
its
summit
became
solemn
silhouettes
against
the
darkening
sky
and
the
monotonous
trickling
of
the
fountain
in
the
court
below
sounded
more
distinct
as
the
street
noises
subsided
she
was
growing
a
little
anxious
when
she
heard
soft
footfalls
on
the
stairs
which
she
at
once
recognized
and
hastened
to
meet
o
you
have
been
gone
so
long
she
exclaimed
happy
as
all
human
beings
are
to
have
another
heart
so
dependent
on
them
the
gratified
lady
passed
her
arm
round
the
waist
of
the
loving
child
and
they
ascended
to
their
rooms
like
two
confidential
after
tea
delano
said
now
i
will
keep
my
promise
of
telling
you
all
i
have
discovered
flora
ran
to
an
ottoman
by
her
side
and
leaning
on
her
lap
looked
up
eagerly
into
her
face
you
must
try
not
to
be
excitable
my
dear
said
her
friend
for
i
have
some
unpleasant
news
to
tell
you
the
expressive
eyes
that
were
gazing
wistfully
into
hers
while
she
spoke
at
once
assumed
that
startled
melancholy
look
strangely
in
contrast
with
their
laughing
shape
her
friend
was
so
much
affected
by
it
that
she
hardly
knew
how
to
proceed
with
her
painful
task
at
last
flora
murmured
is
she
dead
i
have
heard
no
such
tidings
darling
she
replied
but
fitzgerald
has
married
a
boston
lady
and
they
were
the
visitors
who
came
here
this
morning
flora
sprung
up
and
pressed
her
hand
on
her
heart
as
if
a
sharp
arrow
had
hit
her
but
she
immediately
sank
on
the
ottoman
again
and
said
in
tones
of
suppressed
agitation
then
he
has
left
poor
rosa
how
miserable
she
must
be
she
loved
him
so
o
how
wrong
it
was
for
me
to
run
away
and
leave
her
and
only
to
think
how
i
have
been
enjoying
myself
when
she
was
there
all
alone
with
her
heart
breaking
we
go
to
look
for
her
dear
mamita
in
three
days
a
vessel
will
sail
for
marseilles
replied
delano
our
passage
is
taken
and
and
percival
who
intended
to
return
home
soon
are
kind
enough
to
say
they
will
go
with
us
i
wish
they
could
accompany
us
to
the
south
but
he
is
so
well
known
as
an
abolitionist
that
his
presence
would
probably
cause
unpleasant
interruptions
and
delays
and
perhaps
endanger
his
life
flora
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
while
tears
were
dropping
fast
upon
it
and
at
every
turn
of
the
conversation
she
kept
repeating
how
wrong
it
was
for
me
to
run
away
and
leave
her
no
my
child
replied
delano
you
did
right
in
coming
to
me
if
you
had
stayed
there
you
would
have
made
both
her
and
yourself
miserable
beside
doing
what
was
very
wrong
i
met
fitzgerald
once
on
horseback
while
i
was
visiting
at
welby
plantation
but
i
never
fairly
saw
him
until
he
is
so
very
handsome
that
when
i
looked
at
him
i
could
not
but
think
it
rather
remarkable
he
did
not
gain
a
bad
power
over
you
by
his
insinuating
flattery
when
you
were
so
very
young
and
inexperienced
the
guileless
little
damsel
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
surprise
and
said
how
i
bear
to
have
him
make
love
to
when
he
was
rosa
husband
he
is
so
handsome
and
fascinating
that
if
he
had
loved
me
instead
of
rosa
in
the
beginning
i
dare
say
i
should
have
been
as
much
in
love
with
him
as
she
was
i
did
dearly
love
him
while
he
was
a
kind
brother
but
i
could
love
him
it
would
have
killed
rosa
if
i
had
besides
he
told
falsehoods
and
papa
taught
us
to
consider
that
as
the
meanest
of
faults
i
have
heard
him
tell
rosa
he
never
loved
anybody
but
her
when
an
hour
before
he
had
told
me
he
loved
me
better
than
rosa
what
could
i
do
but
despise
such
a
man
then
when
he
threatened
to
sell
me
i
became
dreadfully
afraid
of
him
she
started
up
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
and
exclaimed
wildly
what
if
he
has
sold
rosa
her
friend
brought
forward
every
argument
and
every
promise
she
could
think
of
to
pacify
her
and
when
she
had
become
quite
calm
they
sang
a
few
hymns
together
and
before
retiring
to
rest
knelt
down
side
by
side
and
prayed
for
strength
and
guidance
in
these
new
troubles
flora
remained
a
long
time
wakeful
thinking
of
rosa
deserted
and
alone
she
had
formed
many
projects
concerning
what
was
to
be
seen
and
heard
and
done
in
rome
but
she
forgot
them
all
she
did
not
even
think
of
the
opera
until
she
heard
from
the
street
snatches
of
norma
whistled
or
sung
by
the
dispersing
audience
a
tenor
voice
passed
the
house
singing
ah
thought
she
gerald
and
i
used
to
sing
that
duet
together
and
in
those
latter
days
how
languishingly
he
used
to
look
at
me
behind
her
back
while
he
sang
passionately
deh
cedi
cedi
a
and
poor
cheated
rosa
would
say
gerald
how
much
heart
you
put
into
your
voice
o
shame
shame
what
i
do
but
run
away
poor
rosa
how
i
wish
i
could
hear
her
sing
diva
as
she
used
to
do
when
we
sat
gazing
at
the
moon
shedding
its
soft
light
over
the
pines
in
that
beautiful
lonely
island
and
so
tossed
for
a
long
while
on
a
sea
of
memories
she
finally
drifted
into
chapter
xix
while
flora
was
listlessly
gazing
at
monte
pincio
from
the
solitude
of
her
room
in
the
via
delle
quattro
fontane
rosabella
was
looking
at
the
same
object
seen
at
a
greater
distance
over
intervening
houses
from
her
high
lodgings
in
the
corso
she
could
see
the
road
winding
like
a
ribbon
round
the
hill
with
a
medley
of
bright
colors
continually
moving
over
it
but
she
was
absorbed
in
revery
and
they
floated
round
and
round
before
her
mental
eye
like
the
revolving
shadows
of
a
magic
lantern
she
was
announced
to
sing
that
night
as
the
new
spanish
la
señorita
rosita
campaneo
and
though
she
had
been
applauded
by
manager
and
musicians
at
the
rehearsal
that
morning
her
spirit
shrank
from
the
task
recent
letters
from
america
had
caused
deep
melancholy
and
the
idea
of
singing
not
but
as
a
performer
before
an
audience
of
entire
strangers
filled
her
with
dismay
she
remembered
how
many
times
she
and
flora
and
gerald
had
sung
together
from
norma
and
an
oppressive
feeling
of
loneliness
came
over
her
returning
from
rehearsal
a
few
hours
before
she
had
seen
a
young
italian
girl
who
strongly
reminded
her
of
her
lost
sister
ah
thought
she
if
flora
and
i
had
gone
out
into
the
world
together
to
make
our
own
way
as
madame
first
intended
how
much
sorrow
and
suffering
i
might
have
been
spared
she
went
to
the
piano
where
the
familiar
music
of
norma
lay
open
before
her
and
from
the
depths
of
her
saddened
soul
gushed
forth
bello
a
me
the
last
tone
passed
sighingly
away
and
as
her
hands
lingered
on
the
keys
she
murmured
will
my
heart
pass
into
it
there
before
that
crowd
of
strange
faces
as
it
does
here
to
be
sure
it
will
dear
responded
madame
who
had
entered
softly
and
stood
listening
to
the
last
strains
ah
if
all
would
hear
with
partial
ears
replied
rosabella
with
a
glimmering
smile
but
they
will
not
and
i
may
be
so
frightened
that
i
shall
lose
my
voice
what
have
you
to
be
afraid
of
darling
rejoined
madame
it
was
more
trying
to
sing
at
private
parties
of
accomplished
musicians
as
you
did
in
paris
and
especially
at
the
palace
where
there
was
such
an
company
yet
you
know
that
queen
amelia
was
so
much
pleased
with
your
performance
of
airs
from
this
same
opera
that
she
sent
you
the
beautiful
enamelled
wreath
you
are
to
wear
what
i
was
singing
when
you
came
in
wept
itself
out
of
the
fulness
of
my
heart
responded
rosabella
this
dreadful
news
of
tulee
and
the
baby
unfits
me
for
anything
do
you
think
there
is
no
hope
it
may
prove
untrue
you
know
the
letter
explicitly
states
that
my
cousin
and
his
wife
the
negro
woman
and
the
white
baby
all
died
of
replied
madame
but
do
reproach
me
for
leaving
them
darling
i
feel
badly
enough
about
it
already
i
thought
it
would
be
healthy
so
far
out
of
the
city
and
it
really
seemed
the
best
thing
to
do
with
the
poor
little
until
we
could
get
established
somewhere
i
did
not
intend
to
reproach
you
my
kind
friend
answered
rosa
i
know
you
meant
it
all
for
the
best
but
i
had
a
heavy
presentiment
of
evil
when
you
first
told
me
they
were
left
this
news
makes
it
hard
for
me
to
keep
up
my
heart
for
the
efforts
of
the
evening
you
know
i
was
induced
to
enter
upon
this
operatic
career
mainly
by
the
hope
of
educating
that
poor
child
and
providing
well
for
the
old
age
of
you
and
papa
balbino
as
i
have
learned
to
call
my
good
friend
the
signor
and
poor
tulee
too
how
much
i
intended
to
do
for
her
no
mortal
can
ever
know
what
she
was
to
me
in
the
darkest
hours
of
my
life
well
poor
tulee
troubles
are
all
over
rejoined
madame
with
a
sigh
and
escape
a
great
deal
of
suffering
by
going
out
of
this
wicked
world
for
between
you
and
i
dear
i
do
believe
one
word
about
the
innocent
little
souls
staying
in
purgatory
on
account
of
not
being
baptized
o
my
friend
if
you
only
exclaimed
rosa
in
a
wild
despairing
tone
but
she
instantly
checked
herself
and
said
i
will
try
not
to
think
of
it
for
if
i
do
i
shall
spoil
my
voice
and
papa
balbino
would
be
dreadfully
mortified
if
i
failed
after
he
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
have
me
brought
out
that
is
right
darling
rejoined
madame
patting
her
on
the
shoulder
i
will
go
away
and
leave
you
to
rehearse
again
and
again
rosa
sang
the
familiar
airs
trying
to
put
soul
into
them
by
imagining
how
she
would
feel
if
she
were
in
norma
position
some
of
the
emotions
she
knew
by
her
own
experience
and
those
she
sang
with
her
deepest
feeling
if
i
could
only
keep
the
same
visions
before
me
that
i
have
here
alone
i
should
sing
well
she
said
to
herself
for
now
when
i
sing
diva
i
seem
to
be
sitting
with
my
arm
round
dear
little
flora
watching
the
moon
as
it
rises
above
the
dark
pines
on
that
lonely
island
at
last
the
dreaded
hour
came
rosa
appeared
on
the
stage
with
her
train
of
priestesses
the
orchestra
and
the
audience
were
before
her
and
she
knew
that
papa
and
mamma
balbino
were
watching
her
from
the
side
with
anxious
hearts
she
was
very
pale
and
her
first
notes
were
a
little
tremulous
but
her
voice
soon
became
clear
and
strong
and
when
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
moon
and
sang
casta
diva
the
fulness
and
richness
of
the
tones
took
everybody
by
surprise
cried
the
audience
and
the
chorus
was
not
allowed
to
proceed
till
she
had
sung
it
a
second
and
third
time
she
courtesied
her
acknowledgments
gracefully
but
as
she
retired
ghosts
of
the
past
went
with
her
and
with
her
heart
full
of
memories
she
seemed
to
weep
in
music
while
she
sang
in
italian
restore
to
mine
affliction
one
smile
of
love
protection
again
the
audience
shouted
the
duet
with
adalgisa
was
more
difficult
for
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
be
an
actress
and
she
was
embarrassed
by
the
consciousness
of
being
an
object
of
jealousy
to
the
partly
because
she
was
and
partly
because
the
tenor
preferred
her
but
when
adalgisa
sang
in
italian
the
words
behold
him
she
chanced
to
raise
her
eyes
to
a
box
near
the
stage
and
saw
the
faces
of
gerald
fitzgerald
and
his
wife
bending
eagerly
toward
her
she
shuddered
and
for
an
instant
her
voice
failed
her
the
audience
were
breathless
her
look
her
attitude
her
silence
her
tremor
all
seemed
inimitable
acting
a
glance
at
the
and
at
the
orchestra
recalled
the
recollection
of
where
she
was
and
by
a
strong
effort
she
controlled
herself
though
there
was
still
an
agitation
in
her
voice
which
the
audience
and
the
singers
thought
to
be
the
perfection
of
acting
again
she
glanced
at
fitzgerald
and
there
was
terrible
power
in
the
tones
with
which
she
uttered
in
italian
tremble
perfidious
one
thou
knowest
the
cause
is
ample
her
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
fitzgerald
and
with
a
wonderful
depth
of
pitying
sadness
she
sang
o
how
his
art
deceived
thee
the
wish
she
had
formed
was
realized
she
was
enabled
to
give
voice
to
her
own
emotions
forgetful
of
the
audience
for
the
time
being
and
even
in
subsequent
scenes
when
the
recollection
of
being
a
performer
returned
upon
her
her
inward
excitation
seemed
to
float
her
onward
like
a
great
wave
once
again
her
own
feelings
took
her
up
like
a
tornado
and
made
her
seem
a
wonderful
actress
in
the
scene
where
norma
is
tempted
to
kill
her
children
she
fixed
her
indignant
gaze
full
upon
fitzgerald
and
there
was
an
indescribable
expression
of
stern
resolution
in
her
voice
and
of
pride
in
the
carriage
of
her
queenly
head
while
she
sang
disgrace
worse
than
death
awaits
them
slavery
no
never
fitzgerald
quailed
before
it
he
grew
pale
and
slunk
back
in
the
box
the
audience
had
never
seen
the
part
so
conceived
and
a
few
criticised
it
but
her
beauty
and
her
voice
and
her
overflowing
feeling
carried
all
before
her
and
this
also
was
accepted
as
a
remarkable
inspiration
of
theatrical
genius
when
the
wave
of
her
own
excitement
was
subsiding
the
magnetism
of
an
admiring
audience
began
to
affect
her
strongly
with
an
outburst
of
fury
she
sang
war
war
the
audience
cried
and
she
sang
it
as
powerfully
the
second
time
what
it
was
that
had
sustained
and
carried
her
through
that
terrible
ordeal
she
could
never
understand
when
the
curtain
dropped
fitzgerald
was
about
to
rush
after
her
but
his
wife
caught
his
arm
and
he
was
obliged
to
follow
it
was
an
awful
penance
he
underwent
submitting
to
this
necessary
restraint
and
while
his
soul
was
seething
like
a
boiling
caldron
he
was
obliged
to
answer
evasively
to
lily
frequent
declaration
that
the
superb
voice
of
this
spanish
was
exactly
like
the
wonderful
voice
that
went
wandering
round
the
plantation
like
a
restless
ghost
papa
and
mamma
balbino
were
waiting
to
receive
the
triumphant
as
she
left
the
stage
shouted
the
signor
in
a
great
fever
of
excitement
but
seeing
how
pale
she
looked
he
pressed
her
hand
in
silence
while
madame
wrapped
her
in
shawls
they
lifted
her
into
the
carriage
as
quickly
as
possible
where
her
head
drooped
almost
fainting
on
madame
shoulder
it
required
them
both
to
support
her
unsteady
steps
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
to
their
lofty
lodging
she
told
them
nothing
that
night
of
having
seen
fitzgerald
and
refusing
all
refreshment
save
a
sip
of
wine
she
sank
on
the
bed
utterly
exhausted
chapter
xx
she
slept
late
the
next
day
and
woke
with
a
feeling
of
utter
weariness
of
body
and
prostration
of
spirit
when
her
giovanna
came
at
her
summons
she
informed
her
that
a
gentleman
had
twice
called
to
see
her
but
left
no
name
or
card
let
no
one
be
admitted
but
the
manager
of
the
opera
said
rosa
i
will
dress
now
and
if
mamma
balbino
is
at
leisure
i
should
like
to
have
her
come
and
talk
with
me
while
i
breakfast
madame
has
gone
out
to
make
some
purchases
replied
giovanna
she
said
she
should
return
soon
and
charged
me
to
keep
everything
quiet
that
you
might
sleep
the
signor
is
in
his
room
waiting
to
speak
to
you
please
tell
him
i
have
waked
said
rosa
and
as
soon
as
i
have
dressed
and
breakfasted
ask
him
to
come
to
me
giovanna
who
had
been
at
the
opera
the
preceding
evening
felt
the
importance
of
her
mission
in
dressing
the
celebrated
señorita
rosita
campaneo
of
whose
beauty
and
gracefulness
everybody
was
talking
and
when
the
process
was
completed
the
might
well
have
been
excused
if
she
had
thought
herself
the
handsomest
of
women
the
glossy
dark
hair
rippled
over
her
forehead
in
soft
waves
and
the
massive
braids
behind
were
intertwisted
with
a
narrow
band
of
crimson
velvet
that
glowed
like
rubies
where
the
sunlight
fell
upon
it
her
morning
wrapper
of
fine
crimson
merino
embroidered
with
silk
was
singularly
becoming
to
her
complexion
softened
as
the
contact
was
by
a
white
lace
collar
fastened
at
the
throat
with
a
golden
pin
but
though
she
was
seated
before
the
mirror
and
though
her
own
spanish
taste
had
chosen
the
strong
contrast
of
bright
colors
she
took
no
notice
of
the
effect
produced
her
face
was
turned
toward
the
window
and
as
she
gazed
on
the
morning
sky
all
unconscious
of
its
translucent
brilliancy
of
blue
there
was
an
expression
in
her
luminous
eyes
that
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
an
artist
if
he
could
have
reproduced
her
as
a
sibyl
giovanna
looked
at
her
with
surprise
that
a
lady
could
be
so
handsome
and
so
beautifully
dressed
yet
not
seem
to
care
for
it
she
lingered
a
moment
contemplating
the
superb
head
with
an
exultant
look
as
if
it
were
a
picture
of
her
own
painting
and
then
she
went
out
noiselessly
to
bring
the
the
señorita
campaneo
ate
with
a
keener
appetite
than
she
had
ever
experienced
as
rosabella
the
recluse
for
the
forces
of
nature
exhausted
by
the
exertions
of
the
preceding
evening
demanded
renovation
but
the
services
of
the
cook
were
as
little
appreciated
as
those
of
the
the
luxurious
breakfast
was
to
her
simply
food
the
mirror
was
at
her
side
and
giovanna
watched
curiously
to
see
whether
she
would
admire
the
effect
of
the
crimson
velvet
gleaming
among
her
dark
hair
but
she
never
once
glanced
in
that
direction
when
she
had
eaten
sufficiently
she
sat
twirling
her
spoon
and
looking
into
the
depths
of
her
cup
as
if
it
were
a
magic
mirror
revealing
all
the
future
she
was
just
about
to
say
now
you
may
call
papa
balbino
when
giovanna
gave
a
sudden
start
and
exclaimed
signorita
a
gentleman
and
ere
she
had
time
to
look
round
fitzgerald
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
he
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
passionately
saying
in
an
agony
of
entreaty
o
rosabella
do
say
you
forgive
me
i
am
suffering
the
tortures
of
the
damned
the
irruption
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
for
an
instant
she
failed
to
realize
it
but
her
presence
of
mind
quickly
returned
and
forcibly
withdrawing
the
hand
to
which
he
clung
she
turned
to
the
astonished
and
said
quite
calmly
please
deliver
the
message
i
spoke
of
giovanna
left
the
room
and
proceeded
directly
to
the
adjoining
apartment
where
signor
balbino
was
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
another
gentleman
fitzgerald
remained
kneeling
still
pleading
vehemently
for
forgiveness
fitzgerald
said
she
this
audacity
is
incredible
i
could
not
have
imagined
it
possible
you
would
presume
ever
again
to
come
into
my
presence
after
having
sold
me
to
that
infamous
man
he
took
advantage
of
me
rosa
i
was
intoxicated
with
wine
and
knew
not
what
i
did
i
could
not
have
done
it
if
i
had
been
in
my
senses
i
have
always
loved
you
as
i
never
loved
any
other
woman
and
i
never
loved
you
so
wildly
as
now
leave
me
she
exclaimed
imperiously
your
being
here
does
me
injury
if
you
have
any
manhood
in
you
leave
me
he
strove
to
clutch
the
folds
of
her
robe
and
in
frenzied
tones
cried
out
o
rosabella
do
drive
me
from
you
i
ca
live
without
a
voice
like
a
broke
in
upon
his
sentence
villain
deceiver
what
are
you
doing
here
out
of
the
house
this
instant
fitzgerald
sprung
to
his
feet
pale
with
rage
and
encountered
the
flashing
eyes
of
the
signor
what
right
have
to
order
me
out
of
the
house
said
he
i
am
her
adopted
father
replied
the
italian
and
no
man
shall
insult
her
while
i
am
alive
so
are
installed
as
her
protector
retorted
fitzgerald
sneeringly
you
are
not
the
first
gallant
i
have
known
to
screen
himself
behind
his
years
by
jupiter
vociferated
the
enraged
italian
and
he
made
a
spring
to
clutch
him
by
the
throat
fitzgerald
drew
out
a
pistol
with
a
look
of
utter
distress
rosa
threw
herself
between
them
saying
in
imploring
accents
you
go
at
the
same
moment
a
hand
rested
gently
on
the
signor
shoulder
and
a
manly
voice
said
soothingly
be
calm
my
friend
then
turning
to
fitzgerald
the
gentleman
continued
slight
as
our
acquaintance
is
sir
it
authorizes
me
to
remind
you
that
scenes
like
this
are
unfit
for
a
lady
apartment
fitzgerald
slowly
replaced
his
pistol
as
he
answered
coldly
i
remember
your
countenance
sir
but
i
do
recollect
where
i
have
seen
it
nor
do
i
understand
what
right
you
have
to
intrude
here
i
met
you
in
new
orleans
something
more
than
four
years
ago
replied
the
stranger
and
i
was
then
introduced
to
you
by
this
father
as
alfred
king
of
boston
o
i
remember
replied
fitzgerald
with
a
slight
curl
of
his
lip
i
thought
you
something
of
a
puritan
then
but
it
seems
are
her
protector
also
king
colored
to
the
temples
but
he
replied
calmly
i
know
not
whether
miss
royal
recognizes
me
for
i
have
never
seen
her
since
the
evening
we
spent
so
delightfully
at
her
father
house
i
do
recognize
you
replied
rosabella
and
as
the
son
of
my
father
dearest
friend
i
welcome
you
she
held
out
her
hand
as
she
spoke
and
he
clasped
it
for
an
instant
but
though
the
touch
thrilled
him
he
betrayed
no
emotion
relinquishing
it
with
a
respectful
bow
he
turned
to
fitzgerald
and
said
you
have
seen
fit
to
call
me
a
puritan
and
may
not
therefore
accept
me
as
a
teacher
of
politeness
but
if
you
wish
to
sustain
the
character
of
a
cavalier
you
surely
will
not
remain
in
a
lady
house
after
she
has
requested
you
to
quit
it
with
a
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders
fitzgerald
took
his
hat
and
said
where
ladies
command
i
am
of
course
bound
to
obey
as
he
passed
out
of
the
door
he
turned
toward
rosabella
and
with
a
low
bow
said
the
signor
was
trembling
with
anger
but
succeeded
in
smothering
his
anathemas
king
compressed
his
lips
tightly
for
a
moment
as
if
silence
were
a
painful
effort
then
turning
to
rosa
he
said
pardon
my
sudden
intrusion
miss
royal
your
father
introduced
me
to
the
signor
and
i
last
night
saw
him
at
the
opera
that
will
account
for
my
being
in
his
room
he
glanced
at
the
italian
with
a
smile
as
he
added
i
heard
very
angry
voices
and
i
thought
if
there
was
to
be
a
duel
perhaps
the
signor
would
need
a
second
you
must
be
greatly
fatigued
with
exertion
and
excitement
therefore
i
will
merely
congratulate
you
on
your
brilliant
success
last
evening
and
wish
you
good
morning
i
fatigued
she
replied
but
if
i
bid
you
good
morning
now
it
is
with
the
hope
of
seeing
you
again
soon
the
renewal
of
acquaintance
with
one
whom
my
dear
father
loved
is
too
pleasant
to
be
willingly
relinquished
thank
you
he
said
but
the
simple
words
were
uttered
with
a
look
and
tone
so
deep
and
earnest
that
she
felt
the
color
rising
to
her
cheeks
am
i
then
still
capable
of
being
moved
by
such
tones
she
asked
herself
as
she
listened
to
his
departing
footsteps
and
for
the
first
time
that
morning
turned
toward
the
mirror
and
glanced
at
her
own
flushed
countenance
what
a
time
you
been
having
dear
exclaimed
madame
who
came
bustling
in
a
moment
after
only
to
think
of
fitzgerald
coming
here
his
impudence
goes
a
little
beyond
anything
i
ever
heard
of
was
it
lucky
that
boston
friend
should
drop
down
from
the
skies
as
it
were
just
at
the
right
minute
for
the
signor
such
a
there
no
telling
what
might
have
happened
tell
me
all
about
it
dear
i
will
tell
you
about
it
dear
mamma
replied
rosa
but
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
just
now
for
i
am
really
very
much
flurried
and
fatigued
if
you
had
gone
out
i
should
have
told
you
this
morning
at
breakfast
that
i
saw
and
fitzgerald
at
the
opera
and
that
i
was
singing
at
them
in
good
earnest
while
people
thought
i
was
acting
we
will
talk
it
all
over
some
time
but
now
i
must
study
for
i
shall
have
hard
work
to
keep
the
ground
i
have
gained
you
know
i
must
perform
again
o
how
i
dread
it
you
are
a
strange
child
to
talk
so
when
you
have
turned
head
responded
madame
why
should
i
care
for
everybody
head
rejoined
the
successful
but
she
thought
to
herself
i
shall
not
feel
as
i
did
last
night
that
i
am
going
to
sing
to
strangers
there
will
be
there
who
heard
me
sing
to
my
dear
father
i
must
try
to
recall
the
intonations
that
came
so
naturally
last
evening
and
see
whether
i
can
act
what
i
then
felt
she
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
began
to
sing
di
qual
sei
tu
then
shaking
her
head
slowly
she
murmured
no
it
does
come
i
must
trust
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
but
it
is
a
comfort
to
know
they
will
not
be
strangers
king
took
an
opportunity
that
same
day
to
call
on
fitzgerald
he
was
very
haughtily
received
but
without
appearing
to
notice
it
he
opened
his
errand
by
saying
i
have
come
to
speak
with
you
concerning
miss
royal
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
sir
replied
fitzgerald
is
that
neither
you
nor
any
other
man
can
induce
me
to
give
up
my
pursuit
of
her
i
will
follow
her
wherever
she
goes
what
possible
advantage
can
you
gain
by
such
a
course
inquired
his
visitor
why
uselessly
expose
yourself
to
disagreeable
notoriety
which
must
of
course
place
fitzgerald
in
a
mortifying
position
how
do
you
know
my
perseverance
would
be
useless
asked
fitzgerald
did
she
send
you
to
tell
me
so
she
does
not
know
of
my
coming
replied
king
i
have
told
you
that
my
acquaintance
with
miss
royal
is
very
slight
but
you
will
recollect
that
i
met
her
in
the
freshness
of
her
young
life
when
she
was
surrounded
by
all
the
ease
and
elegance
that
a
father
wealth
and
tenderness
could
bestow
and
it
was
unavoidable
that
her
subsequent
misfortunes
should
excite
my
sympathy
she
has
never
told
me
anything
of
her
own
history
but
from
others
i
know
all
the
particulars
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
allude
to
them
but
after
suffering
all
she
suffered
now
that
she
has
bravely
made
a
for
herself
and
has
such
an
arduous
career
before
her
i
appeal
to
your
sense
of
honor
whether
it
is
generous
whether
it
is
manly
to
do
anything
that
will
increase
the
difficulties
of
her
position
it
is
presumptuous
in
you
sir
to
come
here
to
teach
me
what
is
manly
rejoined
fitzgerald
i
merely
presented
the
case
for
the
verdict
of
your
own
conscience
answered
his
visitor
but
i
will
again
take
the
liberty
to
suggest
for
your
consideration
that
if
you
persecute
this
unfortunate
young
lady
with
professions
you
know
are
unwelcome
it
must
necessarily
react
in
a
very
unpleasant
way
upon
your
own
reputation
and
consequently
upon
the
happiness
of
your
family
you
mistook
your
profession
sir
you
should
have
been
a
preacher
said
fitzgerald
with
a
sarcastic
smile
i
presume
you
propose
to
console
the
lady
for
her
misfortunes
but
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
whoever
attempts
to
come
between
me
and
her
will
do
it
at
his
peril
i
respect
miss
royal
too
much
to
hear
her
name
used
in
any
such
discussion
replied
king
good
morning
sir
the
mean
yankee
exclaimed
the
southerner
as
he
looked
after
him
if
he
were
a
gentleman
he
would
have
challenged
me
and
i
should
have
met
him
like
a
gentleman
but
one
does
know
what
to
do
with
such
cursed
yankee
preaching
he
was
in
a
very
perturbed
state
of
mind
rosabella
had
in
fact
made
a
much
deeper
impression
on
him
than
any
other
woman
had
ever
made
and
now
that
he
saw
her
the
bright
cynosure
of
all
eyes
fresh
fuel
was
heaped
on
the
flickering
flame
of
his
expiring
passion
her
disdain
piqued
his
vanity
while
it
produced
the
excitement
of
difficulties
to
be
overcome
he
was
exasperated
beyond
measure
that
the
beautiful
woman
who
had
depended
solely
upon
him
should
now
be
surrounded
by
protectors
and
if
he
could
regain
no
other
power
he
was
strongly
tempted
to
exert
the
power
of
annoyance
in
some
moods
he
formed
wild
projects
of
waylaying
her
and
carrying
her
off
by
force
but
the
yankee
preaching
much
as
he
despised
it
was
not
without
its
influence
he
felt
that
it
would
be
most
politic
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
his
rich
wife
who
was
besides
rather
agreeable
to
him
he
concluded
on
the
whole
that
he
would
assume
superiority
to
the
popular
enthusiasm
about
the
new
that
he
would
coolly
criticise
her
singing
and
her
acting
while
he
admitted
that
she
had
many
good
points
it
was
a
hard
task
he
undertook
for
on
the
stage
rosabella
attracted
him
with
irresistible
power
to
which
was
added
the
magnetism
of
the
admiring
audience
after
the
first
evening
she
avoided
looking
at
the
box
where
he
sat
but
he
had
an
uneasy
satisfaction
in
the
consciousness
that
it
was
impossible
she
could
forget
he
was
present
and
watching
her
the
day
after
the
second
appearance
of
the
señorita
campaneo
delano
was
surprised
by
another
call
from
the
fitzgeralds
do
think
we
intend
to
persecute
you
said
the
little
lady
we
merely
came
on
business
we
have
just
heard
that
you
were
to
leave
rome
very
soon
but
green
seemed
to
think
it
could
be
so
soon
as
was
said
unexpected
circumstances
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
return
sooner
than
i
intended
replied
delano
i
expect
to
sail
day
after
what
a
pity
your
daughter
should
go
without
hearing
the
new
exclaimed
fitzgerald
she
is
really
a
remarkable
creature
everybody
says
she
is
as
beautiful
as
a
houri
and
as
for
her
voice
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
except
the
first
night
i
spent
on
fitzgerald
plantation
there
was
somebody
wandering
about
in
the
garden
and
groves
who
sang
just
like
her
fitzgerald
did
seem
to
be
much
struck
with
the
voice
but
i
could
never
forget
it
it
was
during
our
honeymoon
replied
her
husband
and
how
could
i
be
interested
in
any
other
voice
when
i
had
yours
to
listen
to
his
lady
tapped
him
playfully
with
her
parasol
saying
o
you
flatterer
but
i
wish
i
could
get
a
chance
to
speak
to
this
señorita
i
would
ask
her
if
she
had
ever
been
in
america
i
presume
not
rejoined
fitzgerald
they
say
an
italian
musician
heard
her
in
andalusia
and
was
so
much
charmed
with
her
voice
that
he
adopted
her
and
educated
her
for
the
stage
and
he
named
her
campaneo
because
there
is
such
a
echo
in
her
voice
sometimes
do
you
think
delano
that
it
would
do
your
daughter
any
serious
injury
to
go
with
us
this
evening
we
have
a
spare
ticket
and
we
would
take
excellent
care
of
her
if
she
found
herself
fatigued
i
would
attend
upon
her
home
any
time
she
chose
to
leave
it
would
be
too
exciting
for
her
nerves
was
delano
laconic
answer
the
fact
is
said
fitzgerald
green
has
told
us
so
much
about
her
that
we
are
extremely
anxious
to
be
introduced
to
her
he
says
she
has
half
seen
rome
and
he
wishes
she
could
join
our
party
i
wish
we
could
persuade
you
to
leave
her
with
us
i
can
assure
you
fitzgerald
is
a
most
agreeable
and
gallant
protector
to
ladies
and
then
it
is
such
a
pity
when
she
is
so
musical
that
she
should
go
without
hearing
this
new
thank
you
rejoined
delano
but
we
have
become
so
much
attached
to
each
other
society
that
i
do
think
either
of
us
could
be
happy
separated
since
she
can
not
hear
this
musical
wonder
i
shall
not
increase
her
regrets
by
repeating
your
enthusiastic
account
of
what
she
has
missed
if
you
had
been
present
at
her
you
would
wonder
at
my
enthusiasm
replied
the
little
lady
fitzgerald
is
getting
over
the
fever
a
little
now
and
undertakes
to
criticise
he
says
she
overacted
her
part
that
she
a
passion
to
tatters
and
all
that
but
i
never
saw
him
so
excited
as
he
was
then
i
think
she
noticed
it
for
she
fixed
her
glorious
dark
eyes
directly
upon
our
box
while
she
was
singing
several
of
her
most
effective
passages
my
dear
interrupted
her
husband
you
are
so
that
you
are
forgetting
the
object
of
your
call
true
replied
she
we
wanted
to
inquire
whether
you
were
certainly
going
so
soon
and
whether
any
one
had
engaged
these
rooms
we
took
a
great
fancy
to
them
what
a
desirable
situation
so
sunny
such
a
fine
view
of
monte
pincio
and
the
pope
gardens
they
were
not
engaged
last
evening
answered
delano
then
you
will
secure
them
immediately
wo
you
dear
said
the
lady
appealing
to
her
spouse
with
wishes
that
the
voyage
might
prove
safe
and
pleasant
they
departed
delano
lingered
a
moment
at
the
window
looking
out
upon
peter
and
the
etruscan
hills
beyond
thinking
the
while
how
strangely
the
skeins
of
human
destiny
sometimes
become
entangled
with
each
other
yet
she
was
unconscious
of
half
the
entanglement
chapter
xxi
the
engagement
of
the
señorita
rosita
campaneo
was
for
four
weeks
during
which
king
called
frequently
and
attended
the
opera
constantly
every
personal
interview
and
every
vision
of
her
on
the
stage
deepened
the
impression
she
made
upon
him
when
they
first
met
it
gratified
him
to
see
that
among
the
shower
of
bouquets
she
was
constantly
receiving
his
was
the
one
she
usually
carried
nor
was
she
unobservant
that
he
always
wore
a
fresh
rose
but
she
was
unconscious
of
his
continual
guardianship
and
he
was
careful
that
she
should
remain
so
every
night
that
she
went
to
the
opera
and
returned
from
it
he
assumed
a
dress
like
the
driver
and
sat
with
him
on
the
outside
of
the
carriage
a
fact
known
only
to
madame
and
the
signor
who
were
glad
enough
to
have
a
friend
at
hand
in
case
fitzgerald
should
attempt
any
rash
enterprise
policemen
were
secretly
employed
to
keep
the
in
sight
whenever
she
went
abroad
for
air
or
recreation
when
she
made
excursions
out
of
the
city
in
company
with
her
adopted
parents
king
was
always
privately
informed
of
it
and
rode
in
the
same
direction
at
a
sufficient
distance
however
not
to
be
visible
to
her
or
to
excite
gossiping
remarks
by
appearing
to
others
to
be
her
follower
sometimes
he
asked
himself
what
would
my
dear
prudential
mother
say
to
see
me
leaving
my
business
to
agents
and
clerks
while
i
devote
my
life
to
the
service
of
an
an
too
who
has
twice
been
on
the
verge
of
being
sold
as
a
slave
and
who
has
been
the
victim
of
a
sham
marriage
but
though
such
queries
jostled
against
conventional
ideas
received
from
education
they
were
always
followed
by
the
thought
my
dear
mother
has
gone
to
a
sphere
of
wider
vision
whence
she
can
look
down
upon
the
merely
external
distinctions
of
this
deceptive
world
rosabella
must
be
seen
as
a
pure
good
soul
in
eyes
that
see
as
the
angels
do
and
as
the
defenceless
daughter
of
my
father
friend
it
is
my
duty
to
protect
her
so
he
removed
from
his
more
eligible
lodgings
in
the
piazza
di
spagna
and
took
rooms
in
the
corso
nearly
opposite
to
hers
where
day
by
day
he
continued
his
invisible
guardianship
he
had
reason
at
various
times
to
think
his
precautions
were
not
entirely
unnecessary
he
had
several
times
seen
a
figure
resembling
fitzgerald
lurking
about
the
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
with
a
cap
very
much
drawn
over
his
face
once
madame
and
the
signor
having
descended
from
the
carriage
with
rosa
to
examine
the
tomb
of
cecilia
metella
were
made
a
little
uneasy
by
the
appearance
of
four
fellows
who
seemed
bent
upon
lurking
in
their
vicinity
but
they
soon
recognized
king
in
the
distance
and
not
far
from
him
the
disguised
policemen
in
his
employ
the
fears
entertained
by
her
friends
were
never
mentioned
to
rosa
and
she
appeared
to
feel
no
uneasiness
when
riding
in
daylight
with
the
driver
and
her
adopted
parents
she
was
sometimes
a
little
afraid
when
leaving
the
opera
late
at
night
but
there
was
a
pleasant
feeling
of
protection
in
the
idea
that
a
friend
of
her
father
was
in
rome
who
knew
better
than
the
signor
how
to
keep
out
of
quarrels
that
recollection
also
operated
as
an
additional
stimulus
to
excellence
in
her
art
this
friend
had
expressed
himself
very
highly
gratified
by
her
successful
and
that
consideration
considerably
increased
her
anxiety
to
sustain
herself
at
the
height
she
had
attained
in
some
respects
that
was
impossible
for
the
thrilling
circumstances
of
the
first
evening
could
not
again
recur
to
set
her
soul
on
fire
critics
generally
said
she
never
equalled
her
first
acting
though
some
maintained
that
what
she
had
lost
in
power
she
had
gained
in
a
more
accurate
conception
of
the
character
her
voice
was
an
unfailing
source
of
wonder
and
delight
they
were
never
weary
of
listening
to
that
volume
of
sound
so
full
and
clear
so
flexible
in
its
modulations
so
expressive
in
its
intonations
as
the
completion
of
her
engagement
drew
near
the
manager
was
eager
for
its
renewal
and
finding
that
she
hesitated
he
became
more
and
more
liberal
in
his
offers
things
were
in
this
state
when
king
called
upon
madame
one
day
while
rosa
was
absent
at
rehearsal
she
is
preparing
a
new
aria
for
her
last
evening
when
they
will
be
sure
to
encore
the
poor
child
to
death
said
madame
it
is
very
flattering
but
very
tiresome
and
to
my
french
ears
their
sounds
too
much
like
a
hiss
will
she
renew
her
engagement
think
you
inquired
king
i
do
know
certainly
replied
madame
the
manager
makes
very
liberal
offers
but
she
hesitates
she
seldom
alludes
to
fitzgerald
but
i
can
see
that
his
presence
is
irksome
to
her
and
then
his
sudden
irruption
into
her
room
as
told
by
giovanna
has
given
rise
to
some
gossip
the
tenor
is
rather
too
assiduous
in
his
attentions
you
know
and
the
is
her
enemy
because
she
has
superseded
her
in
his
affections
these
things
make
her
wish
to
leave
rome
but
i
tell
her
she
will
have
to
encounter
very
much
the
same
anywhere
madame
said
the
young
man
you
stand
in
the
place
of
a
mother
to
miss
royal
and
as
such
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
will
you
without
mentioning
the
subject
to
her
enable
me
to
have
a
private
interview
with
her
morning
you
are
aware
that
it
is
contrary
to
her
established
rule
to
see
any
gentleman
except
in
the
presence
of
myself
or
papa
balbino
but
you
have
manifested
so
much
delicacy
as
well
as
friendliness
that
we
all
feel
the
utmost
confidence
in
you
she
smiled
significantly
as
she
added
if
i
slip
out
of
the
room
as
it
were
by
accident
i
believe
i
shall
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
my
peace
with
her
alfred
king
looked
forward
to
the
next
morning
with
impatience
yet
when
he
found
himself
for
the
first
time
alone
with
rosabella
he
felt
painfully
embarrassed
she
glanced
at
the
fresh
rose
he
wore
but
could
not
summon
courage
to
ask
whether
roses
were
his
favorite
flowers
he
broke
the
momentary
silence
by
saying
your
performances
here
have
been
a
source
of
such
inexpressible
delight
to
me
miss
royal
that
it
pains
me
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
a
last
evening
thank
you
for
calling
me
by
that
name
she
replied
it
carries
me
back
to
a
happier
time
i
hardly
know
myself
as
la
señorita
campaneo
it
all
seems
to
me
so
strange
and
unreal
that
were
it
not
for
a
few
visible
links
with
the
past
i
should
feel
as
if
i
had
died
and
passed
into
another
world
may
i
ask
whether
you
intend
to
renew
your
engagement
inquired
he
she
looked
up
quickly
and
earnestly
and
said
what
would
you
advise
me
the
brevity
of
our
acquaintance
would
hardly
warrant
my
assuming
the
office
of
adviser
replied
he
modestly
the
shadow
of
a
blush
flitted
over
her
face
as
she
answered
in
a
bashful
way
excuse
me
if
the
habit
of
associating
you
with
the
memory
of
my
father
makes
me
forget
the
shortness
of
our
acquaintance
beside
you
once
asked
me
if
ever
i
was
in
trouble
to
call
upon
you
as
i
would
upon
a
brother
it
gratifies
me
beyond
measure
that
you
should
remember
my
offer
and
take
me
at
my
word
responded
he
but
in
order
to
judge
for
you
it
is
necessary
to
know
something
of
your
own
inclinations
do
you
enjoy
the
career
on
which
you
have
entered
i
should
enjoy
it
if
the
audience
were
all
my
personal
friends
answered
she
but
i
have
lived
such
a
very
retired
life
that
i
can
not
easily
become
accustomed
to
publicity
and
there
is
something
i
can
not
exactly
define
that
troubles
me
with
regard
to
operas
if
i
could
perform
only
in
pure
and
noble
characters
i
think
it
would
inspire
me
for
then
i
should
represent
what
i
at
least
wish
to
be
but
it
affects
me
like
a
discord
to
imagine
myself
in
positions
which
in
reality
i
should
scorn
and
detest
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
you
express
this
feeling
responded
he
i
had
supposed
it
must
be
so
it
seems
to
me
the
of
operas
are
generally
singularly
ill
conceived
both
morally
and
artistically
music
is
in
itself
so
pure
and
heavenly
that
it
seems
a
desecration
to
make
it
the
expression
of
vile
incidents
and
vapid
words
but
is
the
feeling
of
which
you
speak
sufficiently
strong
to
induce
you
to
retire
from
the
brilliant
career
now
opening
before
you
and
devote
yourself
to
there
is
one
thing
that
makes
me
hesitate
rejoined
she
i
wish
to
earn
money
fast
to
accomplish
certain
purposes
i
have
at
heart
otherwise
i
do
think
i
care
much
for
the
success
you
call
so
brilliant
it
is
certainly
agreeable
to
feel
that
i
delight
the
audience
though
they
are
strangers
but
their
cries
of
give
me
less
real
pleasure
than
it
did
to
have
papasito
ask
me
to
sing
over
something
that
he
liked
i
seem
to
see
him
now
as
he
used
to
listen
to
me
in
our
flowery
parlor
do
you
remember
that
room
mr
king
do
i
it
he
said
with
a
look
and
emphasis
so
earnest
that
a
quick
blush
suffused
her
eloquent
face
i
see
that
room
as
distinctly
as
you
can
see
it
he
continued
it
has
often
been
in
my
dreams
and
the
changing
events
of
my
life
have
never
banished
it
from
my
memory
for
a
single
day
how
forget
it
when
my
heart
there
received
its
first
and
only
deep
impression
i
have
loved
you
from
the
first
evening
i
saw
you
judging
that
your
affections
were
i
would
gladly
have
loved
another
if
i
could
but
though
i
have
since
met
fascinating
ladies
none
of
them
have
interested
me
deeply
an
expression
of
pain
passed
over
her
face
while
she
listened
and
when
he
paused
she
murmured
softly
i
am
sorry
sorry
echoed
he
is
it
then
impossible
for
me
to
inspire
you
with
sentiments
similar
to
my
own
i
am
sorry
she
replied
because
a
first
fresh
love
like
yours
deserves
better
recompense
than
it
could
receive
from
a
bruised
and
heart
like
mine
i
can
never
experience
the
illusion
of
love
again
i
have
suffered
too
deeply
i
do
not
wish
you
to
experience
the
of
love
again
he
replied
but
my
hope
is
that
the
devotion
of
my
life
may
enable
you
to
experience
the
true
and
tender
he
placed
his
hand
gently
and
timidly
upon
hers
as
he
spoke
and
looked
in
her
face
earnestly
without
raising
her
eyes
she
said
i
suppose
you
are
aware
that
my
mother
was
a
slave
and
that
her
daughters
inherited
her
misfortune
i
am
aware
of
it
he
replied
but
that
only
makes
me
ashamed
of
my
country
not
of
her
or
of
them
do
not
i
pray
you
pain
yourself
or
me
by
alluding
to
any
of
the
unfortunate
circumstances
of
your
past
life
with
the
idea
that
they
can
depreciate
your
value
in
my
estimation
from
madame
and
the
signor
i
have
learned
the
whole
story
of
your
wrongs
and
your
sufferings
fortunately
my
good
father
taught
me
both
by
precept
and
example
to
look
through
the
surface
of
things
to
the
reality
i
have
seen
and
heard
enough
to
be
convinced
that
your
own
heart
is
noble
and
pure
such
natures
can
not
be
sullied
by
the
unworthiness
of
others
they
may
even
be
improved
by
it
the
famous
spurzheim
says
he
who
would
have
the
best
companion
for
his
life
should
choose
a
woman
who
has
suffered
and
though
i
would
gladly
have
saved
you
from
suffering
i
can
not
but
see
that
your
character
has
been
elevated
by
it
since
i
have
known
you
here
in
rome
i
have
been
surprised
to
observe
how
the
young
romantic
girl
has
ripened
into
the
thoughtful
prudent
woman
i
will
not
urge
you
for
an
answer
now
my
dear
miss
royal
take
as
much
time
as
you
please
to
reflect
upon
it
meanwhile
if
you
choose
to
devote
your
fine
musical
genius
to
the
opera
i
trust
you
will
allow
me
to
serve
you
in
any
way
that
a
brother
could
under
similar
circumstances
if
you
prefer
to
be
a
my
father
had
a
cousin
who
married
in
england
where
she
has
a
good
deal
of
influence
in
the
musical
world
i
am
sure
she
would
take
a
motherly
interest
in
you
both
for
your
own
sake
and
mine
your
romantic
story
instead
of
doing
you
injury
in
england
would
make
you
a
great
lioness
if
you
chose
to
reveal
it
i
should
dislike
that
sort
of
attention
she
replied
hastily
do
not
suppose
however
that
i
am
ashamed
of
my
dear
mother
or
of
her
lineage
but
i
wish
to
have
any
interest
i
excite
founded
on
my
own
merits
not
on
any
extraneous
circumstance
but
you
have
not
yet
advised
me
whether
to
remain
on
the
stage
or
to
retire
from
it
if
i
presumed
that
my
opinion
would
decide
the
point
rejoined
he
i
should
be
diffident
about
expressing
it
in
a
case
so
important
to
yourself
you
are
very
delicate
she
replied
but
i
conjecture
that
you
would
be
best
pleased
if
i
decided
in
favor
of
while
he
was
hesitating
what
to
say
in
order
to
leave
her
in
perfect
freedom
she
added
and
so
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
introduce
me
to
your
relative
and
she
is
willing
to
be
my
patroness
i
will
try
my
fortune
in
england
of
course
she
ought
to
be
informed
of
my
previous
history
but
i
should
prefer
to
have
her
consider
it
strictly
confidential
and
now
if
you
please
i
will
say
for
papa
balbino
is
waiting
for
some
instructions
on
matters
of
business
she
offered
her
hand
with
a
very
sweet
smile
he
clasped
it
with
a
slight
pressure
bowed
his
head
upon
it
for
an
instant
and
said
with
deep
emotion
thank
you
dearest
of
women
you
send
me
away
a
happy
man
for
hope
goes
with
me
when
the
door
closed
after
him
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
both
her
hands
how
different
is
his
manner
of
making
love
from
that
of
gerald
thought
she
surely
i
can
trust
time
o
if
i
was
only
worthy
of
such
love
her
revery
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
madame
and
the
signor
she
answered
their
inquisitive
looks
by
saying
rather
hastily
when
you
told
king
the
particulars
of
my
story
did
you
tell
him
about
the
poor
little
i
left
in
new
orleans
madame
replied
i
mentioned
to
him
how
the
death
of
the
poor
little
thing
afflicted
you
rosa
made
no
response
but
occupied
herself
with
selecting
some
pieces
of
music
connected
with
the
performance
at
the
opera
the
signor
as
he
went
out
with
the
music
said
do
you
suppose
she
did
want
him
to
know
about
the
perhaps
she
is
afraid
he
will
think
her
heartless
for
leaving
it
replied
madame
but
i
will
tell
her
i
took
all
the
blame
on
myself
if
she
is
so
anxious
about
his
good
opinion
it
shows
which
way
the
wind
blows

flitted
no
one
knew
whither
before
the
public
were
informed
that
her
engagement
was
not
to
be
renewed
rumor
added
that
she
was
soon
to
be
married
to
a
rich
american
who
had
withdrawn
her
from
the
stage
too
much
to
be
monopolized

who
is

inquired
fitzgerald
they
say
it
is

that
puritan
from
boston
rejoined
her
husband
i
should
have
given
her
credit
for
better
taste
in
private
he
made
all
possible
inquiries
but
merely
succeeded
in
tracing
them
to
a

bound
to
marseilles
to
the
public
the
fascinating
who
had
rushed
up
from
the
horizon
like
a
brilliant
rocket
and
disappeared
as
suddenly
was
only
a
wonder
though
for
some
time
after
when
heard
any
other
much
lauded
they
would
say
ah
you
should
have
heard

such
a
voice

as
easily
as
she
breathed

flora
and
her
friend
were
on
their
way
to

the
places
that
had
formerly
known
her

who
had
long
been
a
steward

through

without
calling
on

and
in
a
hired
boat
proceeded
to
the

flora
almost
flew
over
the
ground
so
great
was
her
anxiety
to
reach
the
cottage
nature
which
pursues
her
course
with
serene
indifference
to
human
vicissitudes
wore
the
same
smiling
aspect
it
had
worn
two
years
before
when
she
went
singing
through
the
woods
like
cinderella
all
unconscious
of
the
beneficent
fairy
she
was
to
meet
there
in
the
form
of
a
new
mamita
trees
and
shrubs
were
beautiful
with
young
glossy
foliage
pines
and
firs
offered
their
aromatic
incense

were
singing
and

a
woodpecker
was
hammering
away
on
the
umbrageous
tree
under
which
flora
used
to
sit
while
busy
with
her
sketches
he
cocked
his
head
to
listen
as
they
approached
and
at
first
sight
of
them
flew
up
into
the
clear
blue
air
with
undulating
swiftness
to
flora
great
disappointment
they
found
all
the
doors
fastened
but
jacobs
entered
by
a
window
and
opened
one
of
them
the
cottage
had
evidently
been
deserted
for
a
considerable
time
spiders
had
woven
their
tapestry
in
all
the
corners
a
pane
had
apparently
been
cut
out
of
the
window
their
attendant
had
opened
and
it
afforded
free
passage
to
the
birds
on
a
bracket
of
which
flora
had
made
to
support
a
vase
of
flowers
was
a
deserted
nest
bedded
in
soft
green
moss
which
hung
from
it
in
irregular
streamers
and
festoons
how
pretty
said
delano
if
the
little
creature
had
studied
the
picturesque
she
could
have
devised
anything
more
graceful
let
us
take
it
bracket
and
all
and
carry
it
home
carefully
that
was
the
very
first
i
made
after
we
came
from
nassau
rejoined
flora
i
used
to
put
fresh
flowers
on
it
every
morning
to
please
rosa
poor
rosa
where
she
be
she
turned
away
her
head
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
pointing
to
the
window
she
said
there
that
dead
i
told
you
i
used
to
call
old
man
of
the
woods
he
is
swinging
long
pennants
of
moss
on
his
arms
just
as
he
did
when
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
him
in
the
moonlight
she
was
soon
busy
with
a
heap
of
papers
swept
into
a
corner
of
the
room
she
used
to
occupy
they
were
covered
with
sketches
of
leaves
and
flowers
and
and
other
devices
with
which
she
had
amused
herself
in
those
days
among
them
she
was
delighted
to
find
the
head
and
shoulders
of
thistle
with
a
garland
round
his
neck
in
rosa
an
old
hung
with
cobwebs
leaned
against
the
wall
o
mamita
lila
i
am
glad
to
find
this
exclaimed
flora
here
is
what
rosa
and
i
used
to
sing
to
dear
papa
when
we
were
ever
so
little
he
always
loved
music
here
are
some
of
canzonets
that
were
his
favorites
she
began
to
hum
time
has
not
thinned
my
flowing
hair
here
is
arne
echo
rosa
used
to
play
and
sing
that
beautifully
and
here
is
what
he
always
liked
to
have
us
sing
to
him
at
sunset
we
sang
it
to
him
the
very
night
before
he
died
she
began
to
warble
now
phoebus
sinketh
in
the
west
why
it
seems
as
if
i
were
a
little
girl
again
singing
to
papasito
and
mamita
said
she
looking
up
she
saw
that
delano
had
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
closing
the
she
nestled
to
her
side
affectionately
inquiring
what
had
troubled
her
for
a
little
while
her
friend
pressed
her
hand
in
silence
o
darling
said
she
what
a
strange
sad
gift
is
memory
i
sang
that
to
your
father
the
last
time
we
ever
saw
the
sunset
together
and
perhaps
when
he
heard
it
he
used
to
see
me
sometimes
as
plainly
as
i
now
see
him
it
is
consoling
to
think
he
did
not
quite
forget
me
when
we
go
home
i
will
sing
it
to
you
every
evening
if
you
would
like
it
mamita
lila
said
flora
her
friend
patted
her
head
fondly
and
said
you
must
finish
your
researches
soon
darling
for
i
think
we
had
better
go
to
magnolia
lawn
to
see
if
tom
and
chloe
can
be
found
how
shall
we
get
there
it
too
far
for
you
to
walk
and
poor
thistle
gone
said
flora
i
have
sent
jacobs
to
the
plantation
replied
delano
and
i
think
he
will
find
some
sort
of
vehicle
meanwhile
you
had
better
be
getting
together
any
little
articles
you
want
to
carry
away
as
flora
took
up
the
some
of
the
loose
leaves
fell
out
and
with
them
came
a
sketch
of
tulee
head
with
the
large
gold
hoops
and
the
gay
turban
here
tulee
shouted
flora
it
is
well
drawn
but
it
like
her
i
make
a
handsome
picture
from
it
and
frame
it
and
hang
it
by
my
bedside
where
i
can
see
it
every
morning
dear
good
tulee
how
she
jumped
up
and
kissed
us
when
we
first
arrived
here
i
suppose
she
thinks
i
am
dead
and
has
cried
a
great
deal
about
little
missy
flory
o
what
would
i
give
to
see
her
she
had
peeped
about
everywhere
and
was
becoming
very
much
dispirited
with
the
desolation
when
jacobs
came
back
with
a
mule
and
a
small
cart
which
he
said
was
the
best
conveyance
he
could
procure
the
jolting
over
hillocks
and
the
occasional
grunts
of
the
mule
made
it
an
amusing
ride
but
it
was
a
fruitless
one
the
plantation
negroes
were

the

villa
at

lawn
peeped
out
from
its
green
surroundings
but
the
jalousies
were
closed
and
the
tracks
on
the
were
obliterated
by
rains
hiring
a
negro
to
go
with
them
to
take
back
the
cart
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
to
the
boat
which
was
waiting
for
them
fatigued
and
disconsolate
with
their
fruitless
search
they
felt
little
inclined
to
talk
as
they
glided
over
the
bright
waters
the
negro
boatmen
frequently
broke
in
upon
the
silence
with
some
simple
wild
melody
which
they
sang
in
perfect
unison
dipping
their
oars
in
rhythm
when
savannah
came
in
sight
they
urged
the
boat
faster
and
improvising
words
to
suit
the
occasion
they
sang

with

they

delano
preferred
not
to
seek
her
friends
in
the
city
and
they
took
lodgings
at
a
hotel
early
the
next
morning
jacobs
was
sent
out
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
fitzgerald
servants
and
delano
proposed
that
during
his
absence
they
should
drive
to
the
pines
which
she
described
as
an
extremely
pleasant
ride
flora
assented
with
the
indifference
of
a
preoccupied
mind
but
scarcely
had
the
horses
stepped
on
the
thick
carpet
of
pine
foliage
with
which
the
ground
was
strewn
when
she
eagerly
exclaimed
tom
tom
a
black
man
mounted
on
the
seat
of
a
carriage
that
was
passing
them
reined
in
his
horses
and
stopped
keep
quiet
my
dear
whispered
delano
to
her
companion
till
i
can
ascertain
who
is
in
the
carriage
are
you
fitzgerald
tom
she
inquired
yes
missis
replied
the
negro
touching
his
hat
she
beckoned
him
to
come
and
open
her
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
she
said
i
want
to
ask
you
about
a
spanish
lady
who
used
to
live
in
a
cottage
not
far
from
fitzgerald
plantation
she
had
a
black
servant
named
tulee
who
used
to
call
her
missy
rosy
we
went
to
the
cottage
yesterday
and
found
it
shut
up
can
you
tell
us
where
they
have
gone
tom
looked
at
them
very
inquisitively
and
answered
dunno
missis
we
are
missy
rosy
friends
and
have
come
to
bring
her
some
good
news
if
you
can
tell
us
anything
about
her
i
will
give
you
this
gold
piece
tom
half
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
take
the
coin
then
drew
it
back
and
repeated
dunno
missis
flora
who
felt
her
heart
rising
in
her
throat
tossed
back
her
veil
and
said
tom
do
you
know
me
the
negro
started
as
if
a
ghost
had
risen
before
him
now
tell
me
where
missy
rosy
has
gone
and
who
went
with
her
said
she
coaxingly
bress
yer
missy
flory
yer
alive
exclaimed
the
bewildered
negro
flora
laughed
and
drawing
off
her
glove
shook
hands
with
him
now
you
know
i
alive
tom
but
do
tell
anybody
where
missy
rosy
gone
o
missy
replied
tom
dar
am
heap
ob
tings
to

delano
suggested
that
it
was
not
a
suitable
place
and
tom
said
he
must
go
home
with
his
master
carriage
he
told
them
he
had
obtained
leave
to
go
and
see
his
wife
chloe
that
evening
and
he
promised
to
come
to
their
hotel
first
so
with
the
general
information
that
missy
rosy
and
tulee
were
safe
they
parted
for
the
present
tom
communication
in
the
evening
was
very
long
and
intensely
interesting
to
his
auditors
but
it
did
not
extend
beyond
a
certain
point
he
told
of
rosa
long
and
dangerous
illness
of
chloe
and
tulee
patient
praying
and
nursing
of
the
birth
of
the
baby
of
the
sale
to
bruteman
and
of
the
process
by
which
she
escaped
with
duroy
further
than
that
he
knew
nothing
he
had
never
been
in
new
orleans
afterward
and
had
never
heard
fitzgerald
speak
of
rosa
at
that
crisis
in
the
conversation
delano
summoned
jacobs
and
requested
him
to
ascertain
when
a
steamboat
would
go
to
new
orleans
flora
kissed
her
hand
with
a
glance
full
of
gratitude
tom
looked
at
her
in
a
very
earnest
embarrassed
way
and
said
missis
am
yer
one
ob
dem
dar
in
de
norf
dat
massa
swars
delano
turned
toward
flora
with
a
look
of
perplexity
and
having
received
an
interpretation
of
the
question
she
smiled
as
she
answered
i
rather
think
i
am
half
an
abolitionist
tom
but
why
do
you
wish
to
know
tom
went
on
to
state
in
lingo
that
had
to
be
frequently
explained
that
he
wanted
to
run
away
to
the
north
and
that
he
could
manage
to
do
it
if
it
were
not
for
chloe
and
the
children
he
had
been
in
hopes
that
fitzgerald
would
have
taken
her
to
the
north
to
nurse
her
baby
while
she
was
gone
to
europe
in
that
case
he
intended
to
follow
after
and
he
thought
some
good
people
would
lend
them
money
to
buy
their
little
ones
and
both
together
they
could
soon
work
off
the
debt
but
this
project
had
been
defeated
by
bell
who
brought
a
white
nurse
from
boston
and
carried
her
infant
grandson
back
with
her
yer
see
missis
said
tom
with
a
sly
look
dey
tinks
de
niggers
do
none
ob
wants
dare
freedom
so
dey
nebber
totes
whar
it
be
ever
since
that
disappointment
had
occurred
he
and
his
wife
had
resolved
themselves
into
a
committee
of
ways
and
means
but
they
had
not
yet
devised
any
feasible
mode
of
escape
and
now
they
were
thrown
into
great
consternation
by
the
fact
that
a
had
been
to
look
at
chloe
because
fitzgerald
wanted
money
to
spend
in
europe
and
had
sent
orders
to
have
some
of
his
negroes
sold
delano
told
him
she
did
see
how
she
could
help
him
but
she
would
think
about
it
and
flora
with
a
sideway
inclination
of
the
head
toward
her
gave
tom
an
expressive
glance
which
he
understood
as
a
promise
to
persuade
her
he
urged
the
matter
no
further
but
asked
what
time
it
was
being
told
it
was
near
nine
he
said
he
must
hasten
to
chloe
for
it
was
not
allowable
for
negroes
to
be
in
the
street
after
that
hour
he
had
scarcely
closed
the
door
before
delano
said
if
chloe
is
sold
i
must
buy
her
i
thought
you
would
say
so
rejoined
flora
a
discussion
then
took
place
as
to
ways
and
means
and
a
strictly
confidential
letter
was
written
to
a
lawyer
from
the
north
with
whom
delano
was
acquainted
requesting
him
to
buy
the
woman
and
her
children
for
her
if
they
were
to
be
sold
it
happened
fortunately
that
a
steamer
was
going
to
new
orleans
the
next
day
just
as
they
were
going
on
board
a
negro
woman
with
two
children
came
near
and
dropping
a
courtesy
said
skuse
missis
dis
ere
chloe
please
say
ise
yer
nigger
do
missis
flora
seized
the
black
woman
hand
and
pressed
it
while
she
whispered
do
mamita
they
going
to
sell
her
you
know
she
took
the
children
by
the
hand
and
hurried
forward
without
waiting
for
an
answer
they
were
all
on
board
before
delano
had
time
to
reflect
tom
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
on
one
side
of
her
stood
chloe
with
two
little
ones
clinging
to
her
skirts
looking
at
her
imploringly
with
those
great
fervid
eyes
and
saying
in
suppressed
tones
missis
dey
gwine
to
sell
me
away
from
de
chillen
and
on
the
other
side
was
flora
pressing
her
hand
and
entreating
send
her
back
mamita
she
was
good
to
poor
rosa
but
my
dear
if
they
should
trace
her
to
me
it
would
be
a
very
troublesome
affair
said
the
perplexed
lady
they
wo
look
for
her
in
new
orleans
they
think
she
gone
north
urged
flora
during
this
whispered
consultation
jacobs
approached
with
some
of
their
baggage
delano
stopped
him
and
said
when
you
register
our
names
add
a
negro
servant
and
her
two
children
he
looked
surprised
but
bowed
and
asked
no
questions
she
was
scarcely
less
surprised
at
herself
in
the
midst
of
her
anxiety
to
have
the
boat
start
she
called
to
mind
her
former
censures
upon
those
who
helped
servants
to
escape
from
southern
masters
and
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
new
dilemma
in
which
she
found
herself
the
search
in
new
orleans
availed
little
they
alighted
from
their
carriage
a
few
minutes
to
look
at
the
house
where
flora
was
born
she
pointed
out
to
delano
the
spot
whence
her
father
had
last
spoken
to
her
on
that
merry
morning
and
the
grove
where
she
used
to
pelt
him
with
oranges
but
neither
of
them
cared
to
enter
the
house
now
that
everything
was
so
changed
madame
house
was
occupied
by
strangers
who
knew
nothing
of
the
previous
tenants
except
that
they
were
said
to
have
gone
to
europe
to
live
they
drove
to
duroy
and
found
strangers
there
who
said
the
former
occupants
had
all
died
of
the
lady
and
gentleman
a
negro
woman
and
a
white
baby
flora
was
bewildered
to
find
every
link
with
her
past
broken
and
gone
she
had
not
lived
long
enough
to
realize
that
the
traces
of
human
lives
often
disappear
from
cities
as
quickly
as
the
ocean
closes
over
the
tracks
of
vessels
jacobs
proposed
searching
for
some
one
who
had
been
in
duroy
employ
and
with
that
intention
they
returned
to
the
city
as
they
were
passing
a
house
where
a
large
hung
in
the
open
window
flora
heard
the
words
blanc
mon
bon
frère
ha
she
called
out
to
jacobs
stop
stop
and
pushed
at
the
carriage
door
in
her
impatience
to
get
out
what
the
matter
my
child
inquired
delano
that
madame
parrot
replied
she
and
an
instant
after
she
was
ringing
at
the
door
of
the
house
she
told
the
servant
they
wished
to
make
some
inquiries
concerning
signor
and
madame
papanti
and
monsieur
duroy
and
she
and
delano
were
shown
in
to
wait
for
the
lady
of
the
house
they
had
no
sooner
entered
than
the
parrot
flapped
her
wings
and
cried
out
jour
joli
petit
and
then
she
began
to
whistle
and
warble
twitter
and
crow
through
a
ludicrous
series
of
noisy
variations
flora
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
in
the
midst
of
which
the
lady
of
the
house
entered
the
room
excuse
me
madame
said
she
this
parrot
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
i
taught
her
to
imitate
all
sorts
of
birds
and
she
is
showing
me
that
she
has
not
forgotten
my
lessons
it
will
be
impossible
to
hear
ourselves
speak
unless
i
cover
the
cage
replied
the
lady
allow
me
to
quiet
her
if
you
please
rejoined
flora
she
opened
the
door
of
the
cage
and
the
bird
hopped
on
her
arm
flapping
her
wings
and
crying
jour
ha
vous
jolie
said
flora
soothingly
while
she
stroked
the
feathery
head
the
bird
nestled
close
and
was
silent
when
their
errand
was
explained
the
lady
repeated
the
same
story
they
had
already
heard
about
duroy
family
was
the
black
woman
who
died
there
named
tulee
inquired
flora
i
never
heard
her
name
but
once
or
twice
replied
the
lady
it
was
not
a
common
negro
name
and
i
think
that
was
it
madame
papanti
had
put
her
and
the
baby
there
to
board
after
duroy
died
his
son
came
home
from
arkansas
to
settle
his
affairs
my
husband
who
was
one
of
duroy
clerks
bought
some
of
the
things
at
auction
and
among
them
was
that
parrot
and
what
has
become
of
signor
and
madame
papanti
asked
delano
the
lady
could
give
no
information
except
that
they
had
returned
to
europe
having
obtained
directions
where
to
find
her
husband
they
thanked
her
and
wished
her
good
morning
flora
held
the
parrot
up
to
the
cage
and
said
jour
jolie
repeated
the
bird
and
hopped
upon
her
perch
after
they
had
entered
the
carriage
flora
said
how
melancholy
it
seems
that
everybody
is
gone
except
how
glad
the
poor
thing
seemed
to
be
to
see
me
i
wish
i
could
take
her
home
i
will
send
to
inquire
whether
the
lady
will
sell
her
replied
her
friend
o
mamita
you
will
spoil
me
you
indulge
me
so
much
rejoined
flora
delano
smiled
affectionately
as
she
answered
if
you
were
very
spoilable
dear
i
think
that
would
have
been
done
already
but
it
will
be
such
a
bother
to
take
care
of
manon
said
flora
our
new
servant
chloe
can
do
that
replied
delano
but
i
really
hope
we
shall
get
home
without
any
further
increase
of
our
retinue
from
the
clerk
information
was
obtained
that
he
heard
duroy
tell
bruteman
that
a
lady
named
rosabella
royal
had
sailed
to
europe
with
signor
and
madame
papanti
in
the
ship
mermaid
he
added
that
news
afterward
arrived
that
the
vessel
foundered
at
sea
and
all
on
board
were
lost
with
this
sorrow
on
her
heart
flora
returned
to
boston
percival
was
immediately
informed
of
their
arrival
and
hastened
to
meet
them
when
the
result
of
their
researches
was
told
he
said
i
should
be
disheartened
yet
perhaps
they
did
sail
in
the
mermaid
i
will
send
to
the
new
york
for
a
list
of
the
passengers
flora
eagerly
caught
at
that
suggestion
and
delano
said
with
a
smile
we
have
some
other
business
in
which
we
need
your
help
you
must
know
that
i
am
involved
in
another
slave
case
if
ever
a
quiet
and
individual
was
caught
up
and
whirled
about
by
a
tempest
of
events
i
am
surely
that
individual
before
i
met
this
dear
little
flora
i
had
a
fair
prospect
of
living
and
dying
a
respectable
and
respected
old
fogy
as
you
irreverent
reformers
call
discreet
people
but
now
i
find
myself
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
abolition
to
the
extent
of
helping
off
four
fugitive
slaves
in
flora
case
i
acted
deliberately
from
affection
and
a
sense
of
duty
but
in
this
second
instance
i
was
taken
by
storm
as
it
were
the
poor
woman
was
aboard
before
i
knew
it
and
i
found
myself
too
weak
to
withstand
her
imploring
looks
and
flora
pleading
tones
she
went
on
to
describe
the
services
chloe
had
rendered
to
rosa
and
added
i
will
pay
any
expenses
necessary
for
conveying
this
woman
to
a
place
of
safety
and
supplying
all
that
is
necessary
for
her
and
her
children
until
she
can
support
them
but
i
do
not
feel
as
if
she
were
safe
here
if
you
will
order
a
carriage
i
will
take
them
directly
to
the
house
of
francis
jackson
in
hollis
street
said
percival
they
will
be
safe
enough
under
the
protection
of
that
honest
sturdy
friend
of
freedom
his
house
is
the
depot
of
various
subterranean
railroads
and
i
pity
the
slaveholder
who
tries
to
get
on
any
of
his
tracks
he
finds
himself
a
toad
under
a
harrow
where
ilka
tooth
gies
him
a
tug
as
the
scotch
say
while
waiting
for
the
carriage
chloe
and
her
children
were
brought
in
flora
took
the
little
ones
under
her
care
and
soon
had
their
aprons
filled
with
cakes
and
sugarplums
chloe
unable
to
restrain
her
feelings
dropped
down
on
her
knees
in
the
midst
of
the
questions
they
were
asking
her
and
poured
forth
an
eloquent
prayer
that
the
lord
would
bless
these
good
friends
of
her
people
when
the
carriage
arrived
she
rose
and
taking
delano
hand
said
solemnly

chloe
down
dar
in
de
let
me
gib
yer
a
kiss
little
missy
flora
threw
her
arms
round
the
bended
neck
and
promised
to
go
and
see
her
wherever
she
was
when
the
carriage
rolled
away
emotion
kept
them
both
silent
for
a
few
minutes
how
strange
it
seems
to
me
now
said
delano
that
i
lived
so
many
years
without
thinking
of
the
wrongs
of
these
poor
people
i
used
to
think
for
slaves
were
very
fanatical
and
foolish
it
seemed
to
me
enough
that
they
were
included
in
our
prayer
for
classes
and
conditions
of
men
but
after
listening
to
poor
chloe
eloquent
outpouring
i
am
afraid
such
generalizing
will
sound
rather
cold
mamita
said
flora
you
know
you
gave
me
some
money
to
buy
a
silk
dress
are
you
willing
i
should
use
it
to
buy
clothes
for
chloe
and
her
children
more
than
willing
my
child
she
replied
there
is
no
clothing
so
beautiful
as
the
raiment
of
righteousness
the
next
morning
flora
went
out
to
make
her
purchases
some
time
after
delano
hearing
voices
near
the
door
looked
out
and
saw
her
in
earnest
conversation
with
florimond
blumenthal
who
had
a
large
parcel
in
his
arms
when
she
came
in
delano
said
so
you
had
an
escort
home
yes
mamita
she
replied
florimond
would
bring
the
parcel
and
so
we
walked
together
he
was
very
polite
said
delano
but
ladies
are
not
accustomed
to
stand
on
the
doorstep
talking
with
clerks
who
bring
bundles
for
them
i
did
think
anything
about
that
rejoined
flora
he
wanted
to
know
about
rosa
and
i
wanted
to
tell
him
florimond
seems
just
like
a
piece
of
my
old
home
because
he
loved
papa
so
much
mamita
lila
did
you
say
papa
was
a
poor
clerk
when
you
and
he
first
began
to
love
one
another
yes
my
child
she
replied
and
she
kissed
the
bright
innocent
face
that
came
bending
over
her
looking
so
frankly
into
hers
when
she
had
gone
out
of
the
room
delano
said
to
herself
that
darling
child
with
her
strange
history
and
unworldly
ways
is
educating
me
more
than
i
can
educate
her
a
week
later
and
percival
came
with
tidings
that
no
such
persons
as
signor
and
madame
papanti
were
on
board
the
mermaid
and
they
proposed
writing
letters
of
inquiry
forthwith
to
consuls
in
various
parts
of
italy
and
france
flora
began
to
hop
and
skip
and
clap
her
hands
but
she
soon
paused
and
said
laughingly
excuse
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
mamita
often
tells
me
i
was
brought
up
in
a
and
i
ask
her
how
then
can
she
expect
me
to
do
anything
but
hop
and
sing
excuse
me
i
forgot
mamita
and
i
were
not
alone
you
pay
us
the
greatest
possible
compliment
rejoined
percival
and
percival
added
i
hope
you
will
always
forget
it
when
we
are
here
do
you
really
wish
it
asked
flora
earnestly
then
i
will
and
so
with
a
few
genial
friends
an
attachment
between
her
and
her
adopted
mother
a
hopeful
feeling
at
her
heart
about
rosa
tulee
likeness
by
her
bedside
and
madame
parrot
to
wish
her
boston
came
to
seem
to
her
like
a
happy
home
chapter
xxiii
about
two
months
after
their
return
from
the
south
percival
called
one
evening
and
said
do
you
know
mr
brick
the
i
met
him
just
now
and
he
stopped
me
plenty
of
work
for
you
abolitionists
said
he
are
five
southerners
at
the
tremont
inquiring
for
runaways
and
cursing
garrison
an
agent
arrived
last
night
from
plantation
he
that
married
bell
daughter
you
know
he
sent
for
me
to
give
me
a
description
of
a
nigger
that
had
gone
off
in
a
mysterious
way
to
parts
unknown
he
wanted
me
to
try
to
find
the
fellow
and
of
course
i
did
for
i
always
calculate
to
do
my
duty
as
the
law
directs
so
i
went
immediately
to
father
snowdon
and
described
the
black
man
and
informed
him
that
his
master
had
sent
for
him
in
a
great
hurry
i
told
him
i
thought
it
very
likely
he
was
lurking
somewhere
in
belknap
street
and
if
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
hunt
him
up
i
would
call
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
to
see
what
luck
he
had
who
is
father
snowdon
inquired
delano
he
is
the
colored
preacher
in
belknap
street
church
replied
percival
and
a
remarkable
man
in
his
way
he
fully
equals
chloe
in
prayer
and
he
is
apt
to
command
the
ship
buzzard
to
the
especial
attention
of
the
lord
the
first
time
i
entered
his
meeting
he
was
saying
in
a
loud
voice
pray
thee
o
lord
to
bless
her
good
ship
the
buzzard
and
if
there
a
now
on
the
coast
of
africa
we
pray
thee
o
lord
to
blow
her
straight
under
the
lee
of
the
buzzard
he
has
been
a
slave
himself
and
he
has
perhaps
helped
off
more
slaves
than
any
man
in
the
country
i
doubt
whether
garrick
himself
had
greater
power
to
disguise
his
countenance
if
a
slaveholder
asks
him
about
a
slave
he
is
the
most
creature
imaginable
you
would
suppose
he
understood
anything
or
ever
understand
anything
but
if
he
meets
an
abolitionist
a
minute
after
his
black
face
laughs
all
over
and
his
roguish
eyes
twinkle
like
diamonds
while
he
recounts
how
he
it
over
the
southern
gentleman
that
bright
soul
of
his
is
a
jewel
set
in
ebony
it
seems
odd
that
the
should
apply
to
to
catch
a
runaway
said
delano
that
the
fun
of
it
responded
percival
the
extinguishers
are
themselves
taking
fire
the
fact
is
boston
policemen
do
feel
exactly
in
their
element
as
they
are
too
near
bunker
hill
and
on
the
fourth
of
july
they
are
reminded
of
the
declaration
of
independence
which
though
it
is
going
out
of
fashion
is
still
regarded
by
a
majority
of
the
people
as
a
venerable
document
then
they
have
whittier
ringing
in
their
ears
slave
hunt
in
borders
no
pirate
on
strand
no
fetters
in
the
bay
state
no
slave
upon
land
how
did
mr
brick
describe
fitzgerald
runaway
slave
inquired
flora
he
said
he
was
tall
and
very
black
with
a
white
scar
over
his
right
eye
that
tom
exclaimed
she
how
glad
chloe
will
be
but
i
wonder
he
did
come
here
the
first
thing
we
could
have
told
him
how
well
she
was
getting
on
in
new
bedford
father
snowdon
will
tell
him
all
about
that
rejoined
percival
if
tom
was
in
the
city
he
probably
kept
him
closely
hidden
on
account
of
the
number
of
southerners
who
have
recently
arrived
and
after
the
hint
the
gave
him
he
doubtless
hustled
him
out
of
town
in
the
quickest
manner
i
want
to
hurrah
for
that
policeman
said
flora
but
mamita
would
think
i
was
a
very
rude
young
lady
or
rather
that
i
was
no
lady
at
all
but
perhaps
you
let
me
hurrah
mamita
receiving
a
smile
for
answer
she
flew
to
the
piano
and
improvising
an
accompaniment
to
herself
she
began
to
sing
hurrah
through
all
manner
of
variations
high
and
low
rapidly
trilled
and
slowly
prolonged
now
bursting
full
upon
the
ear
now
receding
in
the
distance
it
was
such
a
lively
fantasia
that
it
made
percival
laugh
while
delano
face
was
illuminated
by
a
quiet
smile
in
the
midst
of
the
merriment
the
rang
flora
started
from
the
piano
seized
her
and
said
now
mamita
i
ready
to
receive
company
like
a
pink
of
propriety
but
the
change
was
so
sudden
that
her
eyes
were
still
laughing
when
green
entered
an
instant
after
and
he
again
caught
that
archly
demure
expression
which
seemed
to
him
so
fascinating
the
earnestness
of
his
salutation
was
so
different
from
his
usual
formal
politeness
that
delano
could
not
fail
to
observe
it
the
conversation
turned
upon
incidents
of
travel
after
they
had
parted
so
suddenly
i
shall
never
cease
to
regret
said
he
that
you
missed
hearing
la
señorita
campaneo
she
was
a
most
extraordinary
creature
superbly
handsome
and
do
you
know
miss
delano
i
now
and
then
caught
a
look
that
reminded
me
very
much
of
you
unfortunately
you
have
lost
your
chance
to
hear
her
for
king
the
son
of
our
boston
millionnaire
who
has
lately
been
piling
up
money
in
the
east
persuaded
her
to
quit
the
stage
when
she
had
but
just
started
in
her
grand
career
all
the
musical
world
in
rome
were
vexed
with
him
for
preventing
her
as
for
fitzgerald
i
believe
he
would
have
shot
him
if
he
could
have
found
him
it
was
a
purely
musical
disappointment
for
he
was
never
introduced
to
the
fascinating
señorita
but
he
fairly
pined
upon
it
i
told
him
the
best
way
to
drive
off
the
blue
devils
would
be
to
go
with
me
and
a
few
friends
to
the
grotta
azzura
so
off
we
started
to
naples
and
thence
to
capri
the
grotto
was
one
of
the
few
novelties
remaining
for
me
in
italy
i
had
heard
much
of
it
but
the
reality
exceeded
all
descriptions
we
seemed
to
be
actually
under
the
sea
in
a
palace
of
gems
our
boat
glided
over
a
lake
of
glowing
sapphire
and
our
oars
dropped
rubies
high
above
our
heads
were
great
rocks
of
sapphire
deepening
to
at
the
base
with
here
and
there
a
streak
of
malachite
it
seems
like
aladdin
cave
remarked
flora
yes
replied
green
only
it
was
aladdin
cave
undergoing
a
wondrous
change
a
poetess
who
writes
for
the
papers
under
the
name
of
melissa
mayflower
had
fastened
herself
upon
our
party
in
some
way
and
i
suppose
she
felt
bound
to
sustain
the
reputation
of
the
quill
she
said
the
nereids
must
have
built
that
marine
palace
and
decorated
it
for
a
visit
from
fairies
of
the
rainbow
that
was
a
pretty
thought
said
flora
it
sounds
like
rookh
it
was
a
pretty
thought
rejoined
the
gentleman
but
can
give
you
no
idea
of
the
unearthly
splendor
i
thought
how
you
would
have
been
delighted
if
you
had
been
with
our
party
i
regretted
your
absence
almost
as
much
as
i
did
at
the
opera
but
the
blue
grotto
wonderful
as
it
was
did
quite
drive
away
fitzgerald
blue
devils
though
it
made
him
forget
his
vexations
for
the
time
the
fact
is
just
as
we
started
he
received
a
letter
from
his
agent
informing
him
of
the
escape
of
a
negro
woman
and
her
two
children
and
he
spent
most
of
the
way
back
to
naples
swearing
at
the
abolitionists
flora
the
side
of
whose
face
was
toward
him
gave
delano
a
furtive
glance
full
of
fun
but
he
saw
nothing
of
the
mischief
in
her
expressive
face
except
a
little
whirlpool
of
a
dimple
which
played
about
her
mouth
for
an
instant
and
then
subsided
a
very
broad
smile
was
on
percival
face
as
he
sat
examining
some
magnificent
illustrations
of
the
alhambra
green
quite
unconscious
of
the
in
their
thoughts
went
on
to
say
it
is
really
becoming
a
serious
evil
that
southern
gentlemen
have
so
little
security
for
that
species
of
property
then
you
consider
women
and
children
inquired
percival
looking
up
from
his
book
green
bowed
with
a
sort
of
mock
deference
and
replied
pardon
me
percival
it
is
so
unusual
for
gentlemen
of
your
birth
and
position
to
belong
to
the
abolition
troop
of
that
i
may
be
excused
for
not
recollecting
it
i
should
consider
my
birth
and
position
great
misfortunes
if
they
blinded
me
to
the
plainest
principles
of
truth
and
justice
rejoined
percival
the
highly
conservative
gentleman
made
no
reply
but
rose
to
take
leave
did
your
friends
the
fitzgeralds
return
with
you
inquired
delano
no
replied
he
they
intend
to
remain
until
october
good
evening
ladies
i
hope
soon
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
and
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
toward
percival
he
departed
why
did
you
ask
him
that
question
said
flora
are
you
afraid
of
anything
not
in
the
slightest
degree
answered
delano
if
without
taking
much
trouble
we
can
avoid
your
being
recognized
by
fitzgerald
i
should
prefer
it
because
i
do
not
wish
to
have
any
conversation
with
him
but
now
that
your
sister
happiness
is
no
longer
implicated
there
is
no
need
of
caution
if
he
happens
to
see
you
i
shall
tell
him
you
sought
my
protection
and
that
he
has
no
legal
power
over
you
the
conversation
diverged
to
the
alhambra
and
washington
irving
and
flora
ended
the
evening
by
singing
the
moorish
ballad
of
xarifa
which
she
said
always
brought
a
picture
of
rosabella
before
her
eyes
the
next
morning
green
called
earlier
than
usual
he
did
not
ask
for
flora
whom
he
had
in
fact
seen
in
the
street
a
few
minutes
before
excuse
me
delano
for
intruding
upon
you
at
such
an
unseasonable
hour
said
he
i
chose
it
because
i
wished
to
be
sure
of
seeing
you
alone
you
must
have
observed
that
i
am
greatly
interested
in
your
adopted
daughter
the
thought
has
crossed
my
mind
replied
the
lady
but
i
was
by
no
means
certain
that
she
interested
you
more
than
a
very
pretty
girl
must
necessarily
interest
a
gentleman
of
taste
pretty
repeated
he
that
is
a
very
inadequate
word
to
describe
the
most
fascinating
young
lady
i
have
ever
met
she
attracts
me
so
strongly
that
i
have
called
to
ask
your
permission
to
seek
her
for
a
wife
delano
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
answered
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
she
is
not
of
high
family
on
the
father
side
and
on
the
mother
she
is
scarcely
what
you
would
deem
respectable
has
she
vulgar
disagreeable
relations
who
would
be
likely
to
be
intrusive
he
asked
she
has
no
relative
near
or
distant
that
i
know
of
replied
the
lady
then
her
birth
is
of
no
consequence
he
answered
my
family
would
be
satisfied
to
receive
her
as
your
daughter
i
am
impatient
to
introduce
her
to
my
mother
and
sisters
who
i
am
sure
will
be
charmed
with
her
delano
was
embarrassed
much
to
the
surprise
of
her
visitor
who
was
accustomed
to
consider
his
wealth
and
social
position
a
prize
that
would
be
eagerly
grasped
at
after
watching
her
countenance
for
an
instant
he
said
somewhat
proudly
you
do
not
seem
to
receive
my
proposal
very
cordially
delano
have
you
anything
to
object
to
my
character
or
family
certainly
not
replied
the
lady
my
doubts
are
concerning
my
daughter
is
she
engaged
or
partially
engaged
to
another
he
inquired
she
is
not
rejoined
delano
though
i
imagine
she
is
not
quite
free
would
it
be
a
breach
of
confidence
to
tell
me
who
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
attract
her
nothing
of
the
kind
has
ever
been
confided
to
me
answered
the
lady
it
is
merely
an
imagination
of
my
own
and
relates
to
a
person
unknown
to
you
then
i
will
enter
the
lists
with
my
rival
if
there
is
one
said
he
such
a
prize
is
not
to
be
given
up
without
an
effort
but
you
have
not
yet
said
that
i
have
your
consent
since
you
are
so
persistent
rejoined
delano
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
if
you
will
pledge
your
honor
as
a
gentleman
never
to
repeat
it
or
hint
at
it
to
any
mortal
i
pledge
my
honor
he
replied
that
whatever
you
choose
to
tell
me
shall
be
sacred
between
us
it
is
not
pleasant
to
tell
the
story
of
flora
birth
responded
she
but
under
present
circumstances
it
seems
to
be
a
duty
when
i
have
informed
you
of
the
facts
you
are
free
to
engage
her
affections
if
you
can
on
the
paternal
side
she
descends
from
the
french
gentry
and
the
spanish
nobility
but
her
mother
was
a
quadroon
slave
and
she
herself
was
sold
as
a
slave
green
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
spoke
no
word
drilled
to
conceal
his
emotions
he
seemed
outwardly
calm
though
it
cost
him
a
pang
to
relinquish
the
captivating
young
creature
who
he
felt
would
have
made
his
life
musical
though
by
piquant
contrast
rather
than
by
harmony
after
a
brief
troubled
silence
he
rose
and
walked
toward
the
window
as
if
desirous
to
avoid
looking
the
lady
in
the
face
after
a
while
he
said
slowly
do
you
deem
it
quite
right
delano
to
pass
such
a
counterfeit
on
society
i
have
attempted
to
pass
no
counterfeit
on
society
she
replied
with
dignity
flora
is
a
blameless
and
accomplished
young
lady
her
beauty
and
vivacity
captivated
me
before
i
knew
anything
of
her
origin
and
in
the
same
way
they
have
captivated
you
she
was
alone
in
the
world
and
i
was
alone
and
we
adopted
each
other
i
have
never
sought
to
introduce
her
into
society
and
so
far
as
relates
to
yourself
i
should
have
told
you
these
facts
sooner
if
i
had
known
the
state
of
your
feelings
but
so
long
as
they
were
not
expressed
it
would
scarcely
have
been
delicate
for
me
to
take
them
for
granted
very
true
rejoined
the
disenchanted
lover
you
certainly
had
a
right
to
choose
a
daughter
for
yourself
though
i
could
hardly
have
imagined
that
any
amount
of
attraction
would
have
overcome
obstacles
in
the
mind
of
a
lady
of
your
education
and
refined
views
of
life
excuse
my
using
the
word
i
was
slightly
disturbed
when
it
escaped
me
it
requires
no
apology
she
replied
i
am
aware
that
society
would
take
the
same
view
of
my
proceeding
that
you
do
as
for
my
education
i
have
learned
to
consider
it
as
in
many
respects
false
as
for
my
views
they
have
been
greatly
modified
by
this
experience
i
have
learned
to
estimate
people
and
things
according
to
their
real
value
not
according
to
any
merely
external
accidents
green
extended
his
hand
saying
i
will
bid
you
farewell
delano
for
under
existing
circumstances
it
becomes
necessary
to
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
again
calling
upon
you
i
must
seek
to
divert
my
mind
by
new
travels
i
hardly
know
where
i
have
exhausted
europe
having
been
there
three
times
i
have
often
thought
i
should
like
to
look
on
the
oriental
gardens
and
bright
waters
of
damascus
everything
is
so
wretchedly
new
and
so
disagreeably
fast
in
this
country
it
must
be
refreshing
to
see
a
place
that
has
known
no
changes
for
three
thousand
years
they
clasped
hands
with
mutual
adieus
and
the
unfortunate
son
of
wealth
not
knowing
what
to
do
in
a
country
full
of
noble
work
went
forth
to
seek
a
new
sensation
in
the
caravans
of
the
east
a
few
days
afterward
when
flora
returned
from
taking
a
lesson
in
she
said
how
do
you
suppose
i
have
offended
green
when
i
met
him
just
now
he
touched
his
hat
in
a
very
formal
way
and
passed
on
though
i
was
about
to
speak
to
him
perhaps
he
was
in
a
hurry
suggested
delano
no
it
was
that
rejoined
flora
he
did
just
so
day
before
yesterday
and
he
ca
always
be
in
a
hurry
besides
you
know
he
is
never
in
a
hurry
he
is
too
much
of
a
gentleman
her
friend
smiled
as
she
answered
you
are
getting
to
be
quite
a
judge
of
aristocratic
manners
considering
you
were
brought
up
in
a
the
young
girl
was
not
quite
so
ready
as
usual
with
a
responsive
smile
she
went
on
to
say
in
a
tone
of
perplexity
what
have
occasioned
such
a
change
in
his
manner
you
say
i
am
sometimes
thoughtless
about
politeness
do
you
think
i
have
offended
him
in
any
way
would
it
trouble
you
very
much
if
you
had
inquired
delano
not
much
she
replied
but
i
should
be
sorry
if
he
thought
me
rude
to
him
when
he
was
so
very
polite
to
us
in
europe
what
is
it
mamita
i
think
you
know
something
about
it
i
did
not
tell
you
my
child
replied
she
because
i
thought
it
would
be
unpleasant
but
you
keep
no
secrets
from
me
and
it
is
right
that
i
should
be
equally
with
you
did
you
never
suspect
that
green
was
in
love
with
you
the
thought
never
occurred
to
me
till
he
called
here
that
first
evening
after
his
return
from
europe
then
when
he
took
my
hand
he
pressed
it
a
little
i
thought
it
was
rather
strange
in
such
a
formal
gentleman
but
i
did
not
mention
it
to
you
because
i
feared
you
would
think
me
vain
but
if
he
is
in
love
with
me
why
do
he
tell
me
so
and
why
does
he
pass
me
without
speaking
her
friend
replied
he
deemed
it
proper
to
tell
me
first
and
ask
my
consent
to
pay
his
addresses
to
you
as
he
persisted
very
urgently
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
tell
him
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
that
you
were
remotely
connected
with
the
colored
race
the
announcement
somewhat
disturbed
his
habitual
composure
he
said
he
must
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
calling
again
he
proposes
to
go
to
damascus
and
there
i
hope
he
will
forget
his
disappointment
flora
flared
up
as
delano
had
never
seen
her
she
reddened
to
the
temples
and
her
lip
curled
scornfully
he
is
a
mean
man
she
exclaimed
if
he
thought
that
i
myself
was
a
suitable
wife
for
his
serene
highness
what
had
my
to
do
with
it
i
wish
he
had
asked
me
to
marry
him
i
should
like
to
have
him
know
i
never
cared
a
button
about
him
and
that
if
i
did
care
for
him
i
should
consider
it
more
shameful
to
sell
myself
for
his
diamonds
than
it
would
have
been
to
have
been
sold
for
a
slave
by
papa
creditors
when
i
could
help
myself
i
am
glad
you
do
feel
like
going
into
parties
mamita
and
if
you
ever
do
feel
like
it
i
hope
you
will
leave
me
at
home
i
do
want
to
be
introduced
to
any
of
these
cold
aristocratic
bostonians
not
all
of
them
cold
and
aristocratic
darling
replied
delano
your
mamita
is
one
of
them
and
she
is
becoming
less
cold
and
aristocratic
every
day
thanks
to
a
little
cinderella
who
came
to
her
singing
through
the
woods
two
years
ago
and
who
found
a
fairy
godmother
responded
flora
subsiding
into
a
tenderer
tone
it
ungrateful
for
me
to
say
anything
against
boston
and
with
such
friends
as
the
percivals
too
but
it
does
seem
mean
that
green
if
he
really
liked
me
should
decline
speaking
to
me
because
my
had
a
dark
complexion
i
never
knew
the
old
lady
though
i
dare
say
i
should
love
her
if
i
did
know
her
madame
used
to
say
rosabella
inherited
pride
from
our
spanish
grandfather
i
think
i
have
some
of
it
too
and
it
makes
me
shy
of
being
introduced
to
your
stylish
acquaintance
who
might
blame
you
if
they
knew
all
about
me
i
like
people
who
do
know
all
about
me
and
who
like
me
because
i
am
i
that
one
reason
why
i
like
florimond
he
admired
my
mother
and
loved
my
father
and
he
thinks
just
as
well
of
me
as
if
i
had
never
been
sold
for
a
slave
do
you
always
call
him
florimond
inquired
delano
i
call
him
blumenthal
before
folks
and
he
calls
me
miss
delano
but
when
no
one
is
by
he
sometimes
calls
me
miss
royal
because
he
says
he
loves
that
name
for
the
sake
of
old
times
and
then
i
call
him
blumen
partly
for
short
and
partly
because
his
cheeks
are
so
pink
it
comes
natural
he
likes
to
have
me
call
him
so
he
says
flora
is
the
der
in
german
and
so
i
am
the
goddess
of
blumen
delano
smiled
at
these
small
scintillations
of
wit
which
in
the
talk
of
lovers
sparkle
to
them
like
in
the
sunshine
has
he
ever
told
you
that
he
loved
as
well
as
your
name
asked
she
he
never
said
so
mamita
but
i
think
he
does
rejoined
flora
what
reason
have
you
to
think
so
inquired
her
friend
he
wants
very
much
to
come
here
replied
the
young
lady
but
he
is
extremely
modest
he
says
he
knows
he
is
not
suitable
company
for
such
a
rich
educated
lady
as
you
are
he
is
taking
and
lessons
on
the
piano
and
he
is
studying
french
and
italian
and
history
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
he
says
he
means
to
make
a
mint
of
money
and
then
perhaps
he
can
come
here
sometimes
to
see
me
dance
and
hear
me
play
on
the
piano
i
by
no
means
require
that
all
my
acquaintance
should
make
a
mint
of
money
answered
delano
i
am
very
much
pleased
with
the
account
you
give
of
this
young
blumenthal
when
you
next
see
him
give
him
my
compliments
and
tell
him
i
should
be
happy
to
become
acquainted
with
him
flora
dropped
on
her
knees
and
hid
her
face
in
her
friend
lap
she
did
express
her
thanks
in
words
but
she
cried
a
little
this
is
more
serious
than
i
supposed
thought
delano
a
fortnight
afterward
she
obtained
an
interview
with
goldwin
and
asked
what
is
your
estimate
of
that
young
blumenthal
who
has
been
for
some
time
in
your
employ
he
is
a
modest
young
man
of
good
habits
answered
the
merchant
and
of
more
than
common
business
capacity
would
you
be
willing
to
receive
him
as
a
partner
she
inquired
the
young
man
is
poor
rejoined
goldwin
and
we
have
many
applications
from
those
who
can
advance
some
capital
if
a
friend
would
loan
him
ten
thousand
dollars
for
twenty
years
and
leave
it
to
him
by
will
in
case
she
should
die
meanwhile
would
that
be
sufficient
to
induce
you
said
the
lady
i
should
be
glad
to
do
it
particularly
if
it
obliges
you
delano
responded
the
merchant
for
i
really
think
him
a
very
worthy
young
man
then
consider
it
settled
she
replied
but
let
it
be
an
affair
between
ourselves
if
you
please
and
to
him
you
may
merely
say
that
a
friend
of
his
former
employer
and
benefactor
wishes
to
assist
him
when
blumenthal
informed
flora
of
this
unexpected
they
of
course
suspected
from
whom
it
came
and
they
looked
at
each
other
and
blushed
delano
did
not
escape
gossiping
remarks
how
she
has
changed
said
mrs
ton
to
mrs
style
she
used
to
be
the
most
fastidious
of
exclusives
and
now
she
has
adopted
nobody
knows
whom
and
one
of
goldwin
clerks
seems
to
be
on
the
most
familiar
footing
there
i
should
have
no
objection
to
invite
the
girl
to
my
parties
for
she
is
delano
and
she
would
really
be
an
ornament
to
my
rooms
besides
being
very
convenient
and
an
accomplished
musician
but
of
course
i
do
wish
my
daughters
to
be
introduced
to
that
nobody
of
a
clerk
she
has
taken
up
several
of
the
abolitionists
too
rejoined
mrs
style
my
husband
looked
into
an
meeting
the
other
evening
partly
out
of
curiosity
to
hear
what
garrison
had
to
say
and
partly
in
hopes
of
obtaining
some
clew
to
a
fugitive
slave
that
one
of
his
southern
friends
had
written
to
him
about
and
who
should
he
see
there
of
all
people
in
the
world
but
delano
and
her
escorted
by
that
young
clerk
think
of
her
with
her
silks
and
violet
gloves
crowded
and
jostled
by
dinah
and
sambo
i
expect
the
next
thing
we
shall
hear
will
be
that
she
has
given
a
negro
party
in
that
case
i
presume
she
will
choose
to
perfume
her
embroidered
handkerchiefs
with
musk
or
pachouli
instead
of
her
favorite
breath
of
violets
responded
mrs
ton
and
smiling
at
their
wit
the
fashionable
ladies
parted
to
quote
it
from
each
other
as
among
the
good
things
they
had
recently
heard
only
the
faint
echoes
of
such
remarks
reached
delano
though
she
was
made
to
feel
in
many
small
ways
that
she
had
become
a
black
sheep
in
aristocratic
circles
but
these
indications
passed
by
her
almost
unnoticed
occupied
as
she
was
in
earnestly
striving
to
redeem
the
mistakes
of
the
past
by
making
the
best
possible
use
of
the
present
part
second
chapter
xxiv
an
interval
of
nineteen
years
elapsed
bringing
with
them
various
changes
to
the
personages
of
this
story
a
year
after
fitzgerald
return
from
europe
a
feud
sprang
up
between
him
and
his
bell
growing
out
of
his
dissipated
and
spendthrift
habits
his
intercourse
with
boston
was
consequently
suspended
and
the
fact
of
flora
existence
remained
unknown
to
him
he
died
nine
years
after
he
witnessed
the
dazzling
apparition
of
rosa
in
rome
and
the
history
of
his
former
relation
to
her
was
buried
with
him
as
were
several
other
similar
secrets
there
was
generally
supposed
to
be
something
mysterious
about
his
exit
those
who
were
acquainted
with
bell
family
were
aware
that
the
marriage
had
been
an
unhappy
one
and
that
there
was
an
obvious
disposition
to
hush
inquiries
concerning
it
fitzgerald
had
always
continued
to
spend
her
summers
with
her
parents
and
having
lost
her
mother
about
the
time
of
her
widowhood
she
became
permanently
established
at
the
head
of
her
father
household
she
never
in
any
way
alluded
to
her
married
life
and
always
dismissed
the
subject
as
briefly
as
possible
if
any
stranger
touched
upon
it
of
three
children
only
one
her
eldest
remained
time
had
wrought
changes
in
her
person
her
once
figure
was
now
too
short
for
its
fulness
and
the
blue
eyes
were
somewhat
dulled
in
expression
but
the
fair
face
and
the
tresses
were
still
very
pretty
when
she
had
at
last
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
introduction
to
flora
during
one
of
her
summer
visits
to
boston
she
had
been
very
much
captivated
by
her
and
was
disposed
to
rally
green
about
his
diminished
enthusiasm
after
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
fair
cousin
of
hers
but
that
gentleman
was
discreetly
silent
concerning
the
real
cause
of
his
disenchantment
delano
nature
was
so
much
deeper
than
that
of
her
pretty
neighbor
that
nothing
like
friendship
could
grow
up
between
them
but
fitzgerald
called
occasionally
to
retail
gossip
of
the
outer
world
or
to
have
what
she
termed
a
musical
treat
flora
had
long
been
blumenthal
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
delano
said
she
was
willing
to
adopt
a
son
but
not
to
part
with
a
daughter
consequently
they
formed
one
household
as
years
passed
on
infant
faces
and
lisping
voices
came
into
the
domestic
circle
fresh
little
flowers
in
the
floral
garland
of
mamita

life
alfred
royal
the
eldest
was
a
complete
reproduction
in
person
and
character
of
the
grandfather
whose
name
he
bore
rosa
three
years
younger
was
quite
as
striking
a
likeness
of
her
namesake
then
came
two
little
ones
who
soon
went
to
live
with
the
angels
and
lastly
there
was
the
pet
lila
who
inherited
her
father
blue
eyes
pink
cheeks
and
flaxen
hair
these
children
were
told
that
their
grandfather
was
a
rich
american
merchant
in
new
orleans
and
their
grandmother
a
beautiful
and
accomplished
spanish
lady
that
their
grandfather
failed
in
business
and
died
poor
that
his
friend
delano
adopted
their
mother
and
that
they
had
a
very
handsome
aunt
rosa
who
went
to
europe
with
some
good
friends
and
was
lost
at
sea
it
was
not
deemed
wise
to
inform
them
of
any
further
particulars
till
time
and
experience
had
matured
their
characters
and
views
of
life
applications
to
american
consuls
in
various
places
for
information
concerning
signor
and
madame
papanti
had
proved
unavailing
in
consequence
of
the
signor
change
of
name
and
rosabella
had
long
ceased
to
be
anything
but
a
very
tender
memory
to
her
sister
whose
heart
was
now
completely
filled
with
new
objects
of
affection
the
bond
between
her
and
her
adopted
mother
strengthened
with
time
because
their
influence
on
each
other
was
mutually
improving
to
their
characters
the
affection
and
gayety
of
the
young
folks
produced
a
glowing
atmosphere
in
delano
inner
life
as
their
tropical
taste
warmed
up
the
interior
aspect
of
her
dwelling
the
damask
curtains
had
given
place
to
crimson
and
in
lieu
of
the
silvery
paper
the
walls
were
covered
with
color
touched
with
golden
gleams
the
was
covered
with
crimson
embroidered
with
a
garland
and
the
screen
of
the
was
a
gorgeous
assemblage
of
bright
flowers
delano
lovely
face
was
even
more
placid
than
it
had
been
in
earlier
years
but
there
was
a
sunset
brightness
about
it
as
of
one
growing
old
in
an
atmosphere
of
love
the
hair
which
flora
had
fancied
to
be
was
of
a
silky
whiteness
now
and
fell
in
soft
curls
about
the
pale
face
on
the
day
when
i
again
take
up
the
thread
of
this
story
she
was
seated
in
her
parlor
in
a
dress
of
silvery
gray
silk
which
contrasted
pleasantly
with
the
crimson
chair
under
her
collar
of
honiton
lace
was
an
amethystine
ribbon
fastened
with
a
pearl
pin
her
cap
of
rich
white
lace
made
in
the
fashion
of
mary
queen
of
scots
was
very
slightly
trimmed
with
ribbon
of
the
same
color
and
fastened
in
front
with
a
small
amethyst
set
with
pearls
for
fanciful
flora
had
said
dear
mamita
lila
do
have
about
your
dress
cold
white
or
gray
do
let
something
violet
or
lilac
peep
out
from
the
snow
for
the
sake
of
lang
syne
the
lady
was
busy
with
some
when
a
girl
apparently
about
twelve
years
old
came
through
the
and
settled
on
an
ottoman
at
her
feet
she
had
large
luminous
dark
eyes
very
deeply
fringed
and
her
cheeks
were
like
ripened
peaches
the
dark
mass
of
her
wavy
hair
was
gathered
behind
into
what
was
called
a
greek
cap
composed
of
brown
network
strewn
with
gold
beads
here
and
there
very
small
thin
dark
curls
strayed
from
under
it
like
the
tendrils
of
a
delicate
vine
and
nestling
close
to
each
ear
was
a
little
dark
downy
crescent
which
papa
called
her
whisker
when
he
was
playfully
inclined
to
excite
her
juvenile
indignation
see
said
she
this
pattern
comes
all
in
a
tangle
i
have
done
the
stitches
wrong
will
you
please
to
help
me
mamita
lila
delano
looked
up
smiling
as
she
answered
let
me
see
what
the
trouble
is
rosy
posy
blumenthal
who
was
sitting
opposite
noticed
with
artistic
eye
what
a
charming
contrast
of
beauty
there
was
between
that
richly
colored
young
face
with
its
crown
of
dark
hair
and
that
pale
refined
symmetrical
face
in
its
frame
of
silver
what
a
pretty
picture
i
could
make
if
i
had
my
crayons
here
thought
she
how
gracefully
the
glossy
folds
of
mamita
gray
dress
fall
over
crimson
merino
she
was
not
aware
that
she
herself
made
quite
as
charming
a
picture
the
spirit
of
laughter
still
flitted
over
her
face
from
eyes
to
dimples
her
shining
black
curls
were
lighted
up
with
a
rope
of
chenille
hanging
in
a
tassel
at
her
ear
and
her
graceful
little
figure
showed
to
advantage
in
a
neatly
fitting
dress
of
soft
brown
merino
embroidered
with
silk
on
her
lap
was
little
lila
dressed
in
white
and
azure
with
her
fine
flaxen
curls
tossed
about
by
the
motion
of
riding
to
banbury
cross
the
child
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
at
every
caper
and
if
her
steed
rested
for
a
moment
she
called
out
impatiently
more
agin
mamma
but
mamma
was
thinking
of
the
picture
she
wanted
to
make
and
at
last
she
said
we
get
to
banbury
cross
lila
blumen
so
you
must
fall
off
your
horse
darling
and
nursey
will
take
you
while
i
go
to
fetch
my
crayons
she
had
just
taken
her
little
pet
by
the
hand
to
lead
her
from
the
room
when
the
rang
fitzgerald
said
she
i
know
because
she
always
rings
an
rosen
blumen
take
sissy
to
the
nursery
please
while
the
ladies
were
interchanging
salutations
with
their
visitor
rosa
passed
out
of
the
room
leading
her
little
sister
by
the
hand
i
declare
said
fitzgerald
that
oldest
daughter
of
yours
blumenthal
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
who
was
turning
everybody
head
when
i
was
in
rome
you
missed
hearing
her
i
remember
let
me
see
what
was
her
de
i
forget
but
it
was
something
that
signified
a
bell
because
there
was
a
peculiar
ringing
in
her
voice
when
i
first
saw
your
daughter
she
reminded
me
of
somebody
i
had
seen
but
i
never
thought
who
it
was
till
now
i
came
to
tell
you
some
news
about
the
fascinating
señorita
and
i
suppose
that
brought
the
likeness
to
my
mind
you
know
king
the
son
of
our
rich
old
merchant
persuaded
her
to
leave
the
stage
to
marry
him
they
have
been
living
in
the
south
of
france
for
some
years
but
he
has
just
returned
to
boston
they
have
taken
rooms
at
the
revere
house
while
his
father
house
is
being
fitted
up
in
grand
style
for
their
reception
the
lady
will
of
course
be
a
great
lioness
she
is
to
make
her
first
appearance
at
the
party
of
my
cousin
green
the
winter
is
so
nearly
at
an
end
that
i
doubt
whether
there
will
be
any
more
large
parties
this
season
and
i
would
fail
of
attending
this
one
on
any
account
if
it
were
only
for
the
sake
of
seeing
her
she
was
the
handsomest
creature
i
ever
beheld
if
you
had
ever
seen
her
you
would
consider
it
a
compliment
indeed
to
be
told
that
your
rosa
resembles
her
i
should
like
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
if
i
could
without
the
trouble
of
going
to
a
party
replied
blumenthal
i
will
come
the
day
after
rejoined
fitzgerald
and
tell
you
how
she
was
dressed
and
whether
she
looks
as
handsome
in
the
parlor
as
she
did
on
the
stage
after
some
more
chat
about
reported
engagements
and
the
probable
fashions
for
the
coming
season
the
lady
took
her
leave
when
she
was
gone
delano
remarked
king
must
be
very
handsome
if
she
resembles
our
rosa
but
i
hope
fitzgerald
will
not
be
so
injudicious
as
to
talk
about
it
before
the
child
she
is
free
from
vanity
and
i
earnestly
wish
she
may
remain
so
by
the
way
flora
this
king
is
your
father
namesake
the
one
who
you
told
me
called
at
your
house
in
new
orleans
when
you
were
a
little
girl
i
was
thinking
of
that
very
thing
rejoined
blumenthal
and
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
his
christian
name
i
should
like
to
call
there
to
take
a
peep
at
his
handsome
lady
and
see
whether
he
would
recollect
me
if
he
did
it
would
be
no
matter
so
many
years
have
passed
and
i
am
such
an
old
story
in
boston
that
nobody
will
concern
themselves
about
me
i
also
should
be
rather
pleased
to
call
said
delano
his
father
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
it
was
through
him
that
i
became
acquainted
with
your
father
they
were
inseparable
companions
when
they
were
young
men
ah
how
long
ago
that
seems
no
wonder
my
hair
is
white
but
please
ring
for
rosa
dear
i
want
to
arrange
her
pattern
before
dinner
there
the
again
mamita
exclaimed
flora
and
a
very
energetic
ring
it
is
too
perhaps
you
had
better
wait
a
minute
the
servant
came
in
to
say
that
a
person
from
the
country
wanted
to
speak
with
delano
and
a
tall
stout
man
with
a
broad
face
full
of
fun
soon
entered
having
made
a
short
bow
he
said
delano
i
suppose
the
lady
signified
assent
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
my
name
joe
bright
continued
he
no
relation
of
john
bright
the
bright
englishman
wish
i
was
i
come
from
northampton
the
keeper
of
the
mansion
house
told
me
you
wanted
to
get
board
there
in
some
private
family
next
summer
and
i
called
to
tell
you
that
i
can
let
you
have
half
of
my
house
furnished
or
not
just
as
you
like
as
i
plain
joe
bright
the
blacksmith
of
course
you
wo
find
lace
and
damask
and
such
things
as
you
have
here
all
we
wish
for
rejoined
delano
is
healthy
air
and
wholesome
food
for
the
children
plenty
of
both
replied
the
blacksmith
and
i
guess
like
my
wife
she
ai
one
of
the
kind
that
raises
a
great
dust
when
she
sweeps
she
a
still
sort
of
body
but
she
knows
a
deal
more
than
she
tells
for
after
a
description
of
the
accommodations
he
had
to
offer
and
a
promise
from
delano
to
inform
him
of
her
decision
in
a
few
days
he
rose
to
go
but
he
stood
hat
in
hand
looking
wistfully
toward
the
piano
would
it
be
too
great
a
liberty
to
ask
which
of
you
ladies
plays
said
he
i
seldom
play
rejoined
delano
because
my
daughter
blumenthal
plays
so
much
better
turning
toward
flora
he
said
i
suppose
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
to
play
me
a
tune
certainty
not
she
replied
and
seating
herself
at
the
piano
she
dashed
off
with
voice
and
instrument
the
campbells
are
coming
oho
oho
by
george
exclaimed
the
blacksmith
you
was
born
to
it
that
plain
enough
well
it
was
just
so
with
me
i
took
to
music
as
a
newfoundland
pup
takes
to
the
water
when
my
brother
sam
and
i
were
boys
we
were
let
out
to
work
for
a
blacksmith
we
wanted
a
fiddle
dreadfully
but
we
were
too
poor
to
buy
one
and
we
could
have
got
much
time
to
play
o
if
we
had
had
one
for
our
boss
watched
us
as
a
weasel
watches
mice
but
we
were
bent
on
getting
music
somehow
the
boss
always
had
plenty
of
iron
links
of
all
sizes
hanging
in
a
row
ready
to
be
made
into
chains
when
wanted
one
day
i
happened
to
hit
one
of
the
links
with
a
piece
of
iron
i
had
in
my
hand
george
sam
said
i
was
do
again
says
he
sam
blow
said
i
was
afraid
the
boss
would
come
in
and
find
the
iron
cooling
in
the
fire
so
he
kept
blowing
away
and
i
struck
the
link
again
do
just
as
plain
as
my
name
sam
said
he
a
few
days
after
i
said
george
sam
i
found
sol
you
have
said
he
let
try
blow
joe
blow
sam
he
found
re
and
la
and
in
the
course
of
two
months
we
got
so
we
could
play
old
hundred
i
do
pretend
to
say
we
could
do
it
as
glib
as
you
run
over
the
ivory
but
it
was
old
hundred
and
no
mistake
and
we
played
yankee
doodle
first
rate
we
called
our
instrument
the
harmolinks
and
we
enjoyed
it
all
the
more
because
it
was
our
own
invention
i
tell
you
what
there
music
hid
away
in
everything
only
we
do
know
how
to
bring
it
out
i
think
so
rejoined
blumenthal
music
is
a
sleeping
beauty
that
needs
the
touch
of
a
prince
to
waken
her
perhaps
you
will
play
something
for
us
mr
bright
she
rose
and
vacated
the
as
she
spoke
i
should
be
ashamed
to
try
my
clumsy
fingers
in
your
presence
ladies
he
replied
but
i
sing
the
banner
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
accompany
me
she
reseated
herself
and
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
sang
when
he
had
done
he
drew
a
long
breath
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
with
a
bandana
handkerchief
and
laughed
as
he
said
i
made
the
screen
of
your
shake
the
fact
is
when
i
sing
i
to
put
all
my
heart
into
it
and
all
your
voice
too
rejoined
blumenthal
o
no
answered
he
i
could
have
put
on
a
good
deal
more
steam
if
i
had
been
afraid
of
drowning
the
piano
i
greatly
obliged
to
you
ladies
and
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
again
in
my
own
house
i
should
like
to
hear
some
more
now
but
i
stayed
too
long
my
wife
agreed
to
meet
me
at
a
store
and
i
do
know
what
she
say
to
me
tell
her
we
detained
you
by
playing
to
you
said
blumenthal
o
that
would
be
too
much
like
adam
rejoined
he
i
always
feel
ashamed
to
look
a
woman
in
the
face
after
reading
that
story
i
always
thought
adam
was
a
mean
cuss
to
throw
off
all
the
blame
on
eve
with
a
short
bow
and
a
hasty
good
morning
ladies
he
went
out
his
parting
remark
amused
flora
so
much
that
she
burst
into
one
of
her
musical
peals
of
laughter
while
her
more
cautious
friend
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
lest
their
visitor
should
hear
some
sound
of
mirth
and
mistake
its
import
what
a
great
beaming
face
exclaimed
flora
it
looks
like
a
sunflower
i
have
a
fancy
for
calling
him
monsieur
girasol
what
a
pity
green
had
longed
for
a
musical
instrument
and
been
too
poor
to
buy
one
it
would
have
done
him
so
much
good
to
have
astonished
himself
by
waking
up
a
tune
in
the
harmolinks
yes
responded
delano
it
might
have
saved
him
the
trouble
of
going
to
arabia
petraea
or
damascus
in
search
of
something
new
what
do
you
think
about
accepting
mr
bright
offer
o
i
hope
we
shall
go
mamita
the
children
would
be
delighted
with
him
if
alfred
had
been
here
this
morning
he
would
have
exclaimed
he
jolly
i
think
things
must
go
cheerfully
where
such
a
sunflower
spirit
presides
responded
delano
and
he
is
certainly
sufficiently
to
suit
you
and
florimond
yes
he
bubbles
over
rejoined
flora
it
is
the
fashion
but
i
like
folks
that
bubble
over
delano
smiled
as
she
answered
so
do
i
and
perhaps
you
can
guess
who
it
was
that
made
me
in
love
with
bubbling
over
flora
gave
a
knowing
smile
and
dotted
one
of
her
comic
little
courtesies
i
do
see
what
makes
you
and
florimond
like
me
so
well
said
she
i
sure
i
neither
wise
nor
witty
but
something
better
than
either
replied
mamita
the
vivacious
little
woman
said
truly
that
she
was
neither
very
wise
nor
very
witty
but
she
was
a
transparent
medium
of
sunshine
and
the
commonest
glass
filled
with
sunbeams
becomes
prismatic
as
a
diamond
chapter
xxv
green
ball
was
party
of
the
season
five
hundred
invitations
were
sent
out
all
of
them
to
people
unexceptionable
for
wealth
or
fashion
or
some
sort
of
high
distinction
political
literary
or
artistic
smith
had
received
to
prepare
the
most
luxurious
and
elegant
supper
possible
green
was
resplendent
with
diamonds
and
the
house
was
so
brilliantly
illuminated
that
the
windows
of
carriages
traversing
that
part
of
beacon
street
glittered
as
if
touched
by
the
noonday
sun
a
crowd
collected
on
the
common
listening
to
the
band
of
music
and
watching
the
windows
of
the
princely
mansion
to
obtain
glimpses
through
its
lace
curtains
of
graceful
figures
revolving
in
the
dance
like
a
vision
of
seen
through
a
veil
of
mist
in
that
brilliant
assemblage
king
was
the
centre
of
attraction
she
was
still
a
rose
royal
as
gerald
fitzgerald
had
called
her
years
before
a
very
close
observer
would
have
noticed
that
time
had
slightly
touched
her
head
but
the
general
effect
of
the
wavy
hair
was
as
dark
and
glossy
as
ever
she
had
grown
somewhat
stouter
but
that
only
rendered
her
tall
figure
more
majestic
it
still
seemed
as
if
the
fluid
art
whose
harmonies
were
always
flowing
through
her
soul
had
fashioned
her
form
and
was
swaying
all
its
motions
and
to
this
natural
gracefulness
was
now
added
that
peculiar
stylishness
of
manner
which
can
be
acquired
only
by
familiar
intercourse
with
elegant
society
there
was
nothing
foreign
in
her
accent
but
the
modulations
of
her
voice
were
so
musical
that
english
as
she
spoke
it
seemed
all
vowels
and
liquid
consonants
she
had
been
heralded
as
la
señorita
and
her
dress
was
appropriately
spanish
it
was
of
satin
profusely
trimmed
with
black
lace
a
mantilla
of
very
rich
transparent
black
lace
was
thrown
over
her
head
and
fastened
on
one
side
with
a
cluster
of
red
fuchsias
the
golden
stamens
of
which
were
tipped
with
small
diamonds
the
lace
trimming
on
the
corsage
was
looped
up
with
a
diamond
star
and
her
massive
gold
bracelets
were
clasped
with
diamonds
green
received
her
with
great
evidently
considering
her
the
bright
particular
star
of
the
evening
she
accepted
her
distinguished
position
with
the
quietude
of
one
accustomed
to
homage
with
a
slight
bow
she
gave
green
the
desired
promise
to
open
the
ball
with
him
and
then
turned
to
answer
another
gentleman
who
wished
to
obtain
her
for
the
second
dance
she
would
have
observed
her
host
a
little
more
curiously
had
she
been
aware
that
he
once
proposed
to
place
her
darling
floracita
at
the
head
of
that
stylish
mansion
king
peculiar
style
of
beauty
and
rich
foreign
dress
attracted
universal
attention
but
still
greater
admiration
was
excited
by
her
dancing
which
was
the
very
soul
of
music
taking
form
in
motion
and
as
the
tremulous
diamond
drops
of
the
fuchsias
kept
time
with
her
graceful
movements
they
sparkled
among
the
waving
folds
of
her
black
lace
mantilla
like
in
a
dark
night
she
was
of
course
the
prevailing
topic
of
conversation
and
when
green
was
not
dancing
he
was
called
upon
to
repeat
again
and
again
the
account
of
her
wonderful
in
the
opera
at
rome
in
the
midst
of
one
of
these
recitals
fitzgerald
and
her
son
entered
and
a
group
soon
gathered
round
that
lady
to
listen
to
the
same
story
from
her
lips
it
was
familiar
to
her
son
but
he
listened
to
it
with
quickened
interest
while
he
gazed
at
the
beautiful
winding
about
so
gracefully
in
the
evolutions
of
the
dance
king
was
in
the
same
set
with
his
lady
and
had
just
touched
her
hand
as
the
partners
crossed
over
when
he
noticed
a
sudden
flush
on
her
countenance
succeeded
by
deadly
pallor
following
the
direction
her
eye
had
taken
he
saw
a
slender
elegant
young
man
who
with
some
variation
in
the
fashion
of
dress
seemed
the
veritable
gerald
fitzgerald
to
whom
he
had
been
introduced
in
the
flowery
parlor
so
many
years
ago
his
first
feeling
was
pain
that
this
vision
of
her
first
lover
had
power
to
excite
such
lively
emotion
in
his
wife
but
his
second
thought
was
he
recalls
her
son
young
fitzgerald
eagerly
sought
out
green
and
said
please
introduce
me
the
instant
this
dance
is
ended
that
i
may
ask
her
for
the
next
there
will
be
so
many
trying
to
engage
her
you
know
he
was
introduced
accordingly
the
lady
politely
acceded
to
his
request
and
the
quick
flush
on
her
face
was
attributed
by
all
except
king
to
the
heat
produced
by
dancing
when
her
young
partner
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
to
the
next
dance
she
stole
a
glance
toward
her
husband
and
he
saw
that
her
soul
was
troubled
the
handsome
couple
were
the
observed
of
all
observers
and
the
youth
was
so
entirely
absorbed
with
his
mature
partner
that
not
a
little
jealousy
was
excited
in
the
minds
of
young
ladies
when
he
led
her
to
a
seat
she
declined
the
numerous
invitations
that
crowded
upon
her
saying
she
should
dance
no
more
that
evening
young
fitzgerald
at
once
professed
a
disinclination
to
dance
and
begged
that
when
she
was
sufficiently
rested
she
would
allow
him
to
lead
her
to
the
piano
that
he
might
hear
her
sing
something
from
norma
by
which
she
had
so
delighted
his
mother
in
rome
your
son
seems
to
be
entirely
devoted
to
the
queen
of
the
evening
said
green
to
his
cousin
how
can
you
wonder
at
it
replied
fitzgerald
she
is
such
a
superb
creature
what
was
her
character
in
rome
inquired
a
lady
who
had
joined
the
group
her
stay
there
was
very
short
answered
fitzgerald
her
manners
were
said
to
be
unexceptionable
the
gentlemen
were
quite
vexed
because
she
made
herself
so
inaccessible
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
la
campaneo
voice
singing
bello
a
me
the
orchestra
hushed
at
once
and
the
dancing
was
suspended
while
the
company
gathered
round
the
piano
curious
to
hear
the
remarkable
singer
fitzgerald
had
long
ceased
to
allude
to
what
was
once
her
favorite
topic
the
wonderful
resemblance
between
la
señorita
voice
and
a
mysterious
voice
she
had
once
heard
on
her
husband
plantation
but
she
grew
somewhat
pale
as
she
listened
for
the
tones
recalled
that
adventure
in
her
bridal
home
at
magnolia
lawn
and
the
fair
moonlight
vision
was
followed
by
dismal
spectres
of
succeeding
years
ah
if
all
the
secret
histories
and
sad
memories
assembled
in
a
should
be
at
once
revealed
what
a
judgment
night
it
would
be
king
had
politely
complied
with
the
request
to
sing
because
she
was
aware
that
her
host
and
the
company
would
be
disappointed
if
she
refused
but
it
was
known
only
to
her
own
soul
how
much
the
effort
cost
her
she
bowed
rather
languidly
to
the
profuse
compliments
which
performance
and
used
her
fan
as
if
she
felt
oppressed
fall
back
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
a
low
voice
there
is
too
great
a
crowd
round
her
the
hint
was
immediately
obeyed
and
a
servant
was
requested
to
bring
iced
lemonade
she
soon
breathed
more
freely
and
tried
to
rally
her
spirits
to
talk
with
green
and
others
concerning
european
reminiscences
fitzgerald
drew
near
and
signified
to
her
cousin
a
wish
to
be
introduced
for
it
would
have
mortified
her
vanity
when
she
afterward
retailed
the
gossip
of
the
if
she
had
been
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
she
was
not
presented
to
belle
if
you
are
not
too
much
fatigued
said
she
i
hope
you
will
allow
my
son
to
sing
a
duet
with
you
he
would
esteem
it
such
an
honor
i
assure
you
he
has
a
fine
voice
and
he
is
thought
to
sing
with
great
expression
especially
ah
the
young
gentleman
modestly
disclaimed
the
compliment
to
his
musical
powers
but
eagerly
urged
his
mother
request
as
he
bent
near
the
waiting
for
her
reply
her
watchful
husband
again
noticed
a
quick
flush
suffusing
her
face
succeeded
by
deadly
pallor
gently
moving
young
fitzgerald
aside
he
said
in
a
low
tone
are
you
not
well
my
dear
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
look
of
distress
and
replied
no
i
am
not
well
please
order
the
carriage
he
took
her
arm
within
his
and
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
crowd
she
bowed
gracefully
to
the
right
and
left
in
answer
to
the
lamentations
occasioned
by
her
departure
young
fitzgerald
followed
to
the
hall
door
to
offer
in
the
name
of
green
a
beautiful
bouquet
enclosed
within
an
arum
lily
of
silver
filigree
she
bowed
her
thanks
and
drawing
from
it
a
delicate
presented
it
to
him
he
wore
it
as
a
trophy
the
remainder
of
the
evening
and
none
of
the
young
ladies
who
teased
him
for
it
succeeded
in
obtaining
it
when
and
king
were
in
the
carriage
he
took
her
hand
tenderly
and
said
my
dear
that
young
man
recalled
to
mind
your
infant
son
who
died
with
poor
tulee
with
a
heavy
sigh
she
answered
yes
i
am
thinking
of
that
poor
little
baby
he
held
her
hand
clasped
in
his
but
deeming
it
most
kind
not
to
intrude
into
the
sanctum
of
that
sad
and
tender
memory
he
remained
silent
she
spoke
no
other
word
as
they
rode
toward
their
hotel
she
was
seeing
a
vision
of
those
two
babes
lying
side
by
side
on
that
dreadful
night
when
her
tortured
soul
was
for
a
while
filled
with
bitter
hatred
for
the
man
she
had
loved
so
truly
fitzgerald
and
her
son
were
the
earliest
among
the
callers
the
next
day
king
happened
to
rest
her
hand
lightly
on
the
back
of
a
chair
while
she
exchanged
salutations
with
them
and
her
husband
noticed
that
the
lace
of
her
hanging
sleeve
trembled
violently
you
took
everybody
by
storm
last
evening
king
just
as
you
did
when
you
first
appeared
as
norma
said
the
loquacious
fitzgerald
as
for
you
king
i
do
know
but
you
would
have
received
a
hundred
challenges
if
gentlemen
had
known
you
were
going
to
carry
off
the
prize
so
sly
of
you
too
for
i
always
heard
you
were
entirely
indifferent
to
ladies
ah
well
the
world
do
always
know
what
it
talking
about
rejoined
king
smiling
further
remarks
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
young
girl
whom
he
took
by
the
hand
and
introduced
as
my
daughter
eulalia
nature
is
very
capricious
in
the
varieties
she
produces
by
mixing
flowers
with
each
other
sometimes
the
different
tints
of
each
are
blended
in
a
new
color
compounded
of
both
sometimes
the
color
of
one
is
delicately
shaded
into
the
other
sometimes
one
color
is
marked
in
distinct
stripes
or
rings
upon
the
other
and
sometimes
the
separate
hues
are
mottled
and
clouded
nature
had
indulged
in
one
of
her
freaks
in
the
production
of
eulalia
a
maiden
of
fifteen
summers
the
only
surviving
child
of
and
king
she
inherited
her
mother
tall
flexile
form
and
her
long
dark
eyelashes
eyebrows
and
hair
but
she
had
her
father
large
blue
eyes
and
his
complexion
the
combination
was
peculiar
and
very
handsome
especially
the
serene
eyes
which
looked
out
from
their
dark
surroundings
like
clear
blue
water
deeply
shaded
by
shrubbery
around
its
edges
her
manners
were
a
little
shy
for
her
parents
had
wisely
forborne
an
early
introduction
to
society
but
she
entered
pleasantly
enough
into
some
small
talk
with
fitzgerald
about
the
skating
parties
of
the
winter
and
a
new
polka
that
he
thought
she
would
like
to
practise
callers
began
to
arrive
rapidly
there
was
a
line
of
carriages
at
the
door
and
still
it
lengthened
king
received
them
all
with
graceful
courtesy
and
endeavored
to
say
something
pleasing
to
each
but
in
the
midst
of
it
all
she
never
lost
sight
of
gerald
and
eulalia
after
a
short
time
she
beckoned
to
her
daughter
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
fan
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
her
aside
the
young
girl
left
the
room
and
did
not
return
to
it
fitzgerald
after
interchanging
some
brief
remarks
with
king
about
the
classes
at
cambridge
approached
the
and
said
in
lowered
tones
i
tried
to
call
early
with
the
hope
of
hearing
you
sing
but
i
was
detained
by
business
for
grandfather
and
even
if
you
were
graciously
inclined
to
gratify
my
presumptuous
wish
you
will
not
be
released
from
company
this
morning
may
i
say
certainly
she
replied
looking
up
at
him
with
an
expression
in
her
beautiful
eyes
that
produced
a
glow
of
gratified
vanity
he
bowed
good
morning
with
the
smiling
conviction
that
he
was
a
great
favorite
with
the
distinguished
lady
when
the
last
caller
had
retired
king
after
exchanging
some
general
observations
with
her
husband
concerning
her
impressions
of
boston
and
its
people
seated
herself
at
the
window
with
a
number
of
harper
weekly
in
her
hand
but
the
paper
soon
dropped
on
her
lap
and
she
seemed
gazing
into
infinity
the
people
passing
and
repassing
were
invisible
to
her
she
was
away
in
that
lonely
island
home
with
two
babies
lying
near
her
side
by
side
her
husband
looked
at
her
over
his
newspaper
now
and
then
and
observing
her
intense
abstraction
he
stepped
softly
across
the
room
and
laying
his
hand
gently
upon
her
head
said
rosa
dear
do
memories
trouble
you
so
much
that
you
regret
having
returned
to
america
without
change
of
posture
she
answered
it
matters
not
where
we
are
we
must
always
carry
ourselves
with
us
then
as
if
reproaching
herself
for
so
cold
a
response
to
his
kind
inquiry
she
looked
up
at
him
and
kissing
his
hand
said
dear
alfred
good
angel
of
my
life
i
do
not
deserve
such
a
heart
as
yours
he
had
never
seen
such
a
melancholy
expression
in
her
eyes
since
the
day
she
first
encouraged
him
to
hope
for
her
affection
he
made
no
direct
allusion
to
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
for
the
painful
history
of
her
early
love
was
a
theme
they
mutually
avoided
but
he
sought
by
the
most
assiduous
tenderness
to
chase
away
the
gloomy
phantoms
that
were
taking
possession
of
her
soul
in
answer
to
his
urgent
entreaty
that
she
would
express
to
him
unreservedly
any
wish
she
might
form
she
said
as
if
thinking
aloud
of
course
they
buried
poor
tulee
among
the
negroes
but
perhaps
they
buried
the
baby
with
and
duroy
and
inscribed
something
about
him
on
the
gravestone
it
is
hardly
probable
he
replied
but
if
it
would
give
you
satisfaction
to
search
we
will
go
to
new
orleans
thank
you
rejoined
she
and
i
should
like
it
very
much
if
you
could
leave
orders
to
engage
lodgings
for
the
summer
somewhere
distant
from
boston
that
we
might
go
and
take
possession
as
soon
as
we
return
he
promised
compliance
with
her
wishes
but
the
thought
flitted
through
his
mind
can
it
be
possible
the
young
man
fascinates
her
that
she
wants
to
fly
from
him
i
am
going
to
eulalia
now
said
she
with
one
of
her
sweet
smiles
it
will
be
pleasanter
for
the
dear
child
when
we
get
out
of
this
whirl
of
society
which
so
much
disturbs
our
domestic
companionship
as
she
kissed
her
hand
to
him
at
the
door
he
thought
to
himself
whatever
this
inward
struggle
may
be
she
will
remain
true
to
her
pure
and
noble
character
fitzgerald
meanwhile
quite
unconscious
that
the
flowery
surface
she
had
witnessed
covered
such
agitated
depths
hastened
to
keep
her
promise
of
describing
the
party
to
delano
and
her
daughter
i
assure
you
said
she
la
señorita
looked
quite
as
handsome
in
the
as
she
did
on
the
stage
she
is
stouter
than
she
was
then
but
not
so
and
forty
as
i
am
large
proportions
suit
her
stately
figure
as
for
her
dress
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
it
it
was
splendid
and
wonderfully
becoming
to
her
rich
complexion
it
was
completely
spanish
from
the
mantilla
on
her
head
to
the
black
satin
slippers
with
red
bows
and
brilliants
she
was
all
satin
black
lace
and
diamonds
how
i
should
like
to
have
seen
her
exclaimed
blumenthal
whose
fancy
was
at
once
taken
by
the
bright
color
and
strong
contrast
of
the
costume
but
delano
remarked
i
should
think
her
style
of
dress
rather
too
and
theatrical
too
suggestive
of
fanny
elsler
and
the
bolero
doubtless
it
would
be
so
for
you
or
i
rejoined
fitzgerald
mother
used
to
say
you
had
a
poet
lover
who
called
you
the
twilight
cloud
violet
dissolving
into
lilac
and
when
i
was
a
young
lady
some
of
my
admirers
compared
me
to
the
new
moon
which
must
of
course
appear
in
azure
and
silver
but
i
assure
you
king
conspicuous
dress
was
extremely
becoming
to
her
style
of
face
and
figure
i
wish
i
had
counted
how
many
gentlemen
quoted
walks
in
beauty
like
the
night
it
became
really
ridiculous
at
last
gerald
and
i
called
upon
her
this
morning
and
we
found
her
handsome
in
the
parlor
by
daylight
which
is
a
trying
test
to
the
forties
you
know
we
were
introduced
to
their
only
daughter
eulalia
a
very
young
miss
with
eyes
and
black
eyelashes
like
some
of
the
circassian
beauties
i
have
read
off
gerald
thinks
her
almost
as
handsome
as
her
mother
what
a
fortune
that
girl
will
be
but
i
have
promised
ever
so
many
people
to
tell
them
about
the
party
so
i
must
bid
you
good
by
when
the
door
closed
after
her
flora
remarked
i
never
heard
of
anybody
but
my
mamita
who
was
named
eulalia
eulalia
was
a
spanish
saint
responded
delano
and
her
name
is
so
very
musical
that
it
would
naturally
please
the
ear
of
la
señorita
my
curiosity
is
considerably
excited
to
see
this
stylish
lady
said
flora
we
will
wait
a
little
till
the
first
rush
of
visitors
has
somewhat
subsided
and
then
we
will
call
rejoined
delano
they
called
three
days
after
and
were
informed
that
and
king
had
gone
to

strange
contrasts
occur
in
human
society
even
where
there
is
such
a
strong
tendency
toward
equality
as
there
is
in
new
england
a
few
hours
before
queen
fashion
held
her
splendid
court
in
beacon
street
a
vessel
from
new
orleans
called
the
king
cotton
approached
long
wharf
in
boston
before
she
touched
the
pier
a
young
man
jumped
on
board
from
another
vessel
close
by
he
went
directly
up
to
the
captain
and
said
in
a
low
hurried
tone
let
nobody
land
you
have
slaves
on
board
bell
is
in
a
carriage
on
the
wharf
waiting
to
speak
to
you
having
delivered
this
message
he
disappeared
in
the
same
direction
that
he
came
this
brief
interview
was
uneasily
watched
by
one
of
the
passengers
a
young
man
apparently
nineteen
or
twenty
years
old
he
whispered
to
a
yellow
lad
who
was
his
servant
and
both
attempted
to
land
by
crossing
the
adjoining
vessel
but
the
captain
intercepted
them
saying
all
must
remain
on
board
till
we
draw
up
to
the
wharf
with
desperate
leaps
they
sprang
past
him
he
tried
to
seize
them
calling
aloud
stop
thief
stop
thief
some
of
his
sailors
rushed
after
them
as
they
ran
up
state
street
lads
and
boys
always
ready
to
hunt
anything
joined
in
the
pursuit
a
young
black
man
who
was
passing
down
the
street
as
the
crowd
rushed
up
saw
the
yellow
lad
race
by
him
panting
for
breath
and
heard
him
cry
help
me
the
crowd
soon
turned
backward
having
caught
the
fugitives
the
black
man
hurried
after
and
as
they
were
putting
them
on
board
the
vessel
he
pushed
his
way
close
to
the
yellow
lad
and
again
heard
him
say
help
me
i
am
a
slave
the
black
man
paused
only
to
look
at
the
name
of
the
vessel
and
then
hastened
with
all
speed
to
the
house
of
willard
percival
almost
out
of
breath
with
his
hurry
he
said
to
that
gentleman
a
vessel
from
new
orleans
named
king
cotton
has
come
up
to
long
wharf
they
got
two
slaves
aboard
they
was
chasing
up
state
street
calling
out
thief
and
i
heard
a
mulatto
lad
cry
me
i
run
after
and
just
as
they
was
going
to
put
the
mulatto
lad
aboard
the
vessel
i
pushed
my
way
close
up
to
him
and
he
said
me
i
a
slave
so
i
run
fast
as
i
could
to
tell
you
wait
a
moment
till
i
write
a
note
to
francis
jackson
which
you
must
carry
as
quick
as
you
can
said
percival
i
will
go
to
sewall
for
a
writ
of
while
this
was
going
on
the
captain
had
locked
the
fugitives
in
the
hold
of
his
vessel
and
hastened
to
the
carriage
which
had
been
waiting
for
him
at
a
short
distance
from
the
wharf
good
evening
bell
said
he
raising
his
hat
as
he
approached
the
carriage
door
good
evening
captain
kane
replied
the
gentleman
inside
kept
me
waiting
so
long
i
was
nearly
out
of
patience
i
sent
you
word
they
escaped
sir
rejoined
the
captain
they
gave
us
a
run
but
we
got
fast
enough
in
the
hold
one
of
seems
to
be
a
white
man
perhaps
he
an
abolitionist
that
been
helping
the
nigger
off
it
good
enough
for
him
to
be
sent
back
to
the
south
if
they
get
hold
of
him
there
he
never
have
a
chance
to
meddle
with
gentlemen
property
again
they
both
slaves
replied
bell
the
telegram
i
received
informed
me
that
one
would
pass
himself
for
a
white
man
but
captain
you
must
take
directly
to
castle
island
one
of
the
officers
there
will
lock
up
if
you
tell
them
i
sent
you
and
you
ca
be
off
too
quick
for
as
likely
as
not
the
abolitionists
will
get
wind
of
it
and
be
raising
a
row
before
morning
there
no
safety
for
property
having
given
these
orders
the
wealthy
merchant
bade
the
captain
good
evening
and
his
carriage
rolled
away
the
unhappy
fugitives
were
immediately
taken
from
the
hold
of
the
vessel
pinioned
fast
and
hustled
on
board
a
boat
which
urged
its
swift
way
through
the
waters
to
castle
island
where
they
were
safely
locked
up
till
further
orders
o
george
they
send
us
back
said
the
younger
one
i
wish
we
war
dead
george
answered
with
a
deep
groan
o
how
i
have
watched
the
north
star
thinking
always
it
pointed
to
a
land
of
freedom
o
my
god
is
there
place
of
refuge
for
the
slave
are
so
white
you
could
have
got
off
if
you
had
brought
with
you
sobbed
the
other
and
what
good
would
freedom
do
me
without
you
henny
responded
the
young
man
drawing
his
companion
closer
to
his
breast
cheer
up
honey
i
try
again
and
perhaps
we
make
out
better
next
time
he
tried
to
talk
hopefully
but
when
yellow
henny
in
her
boy
dress
cried
herself
to
sleep
on
his
shoulder
his
tears
dropped
slowly
on
her
head
while
he
sat
there
gazing
at
the
glittering
stars
with
a
feeling
of
utter
discouragement
and
desolation
that
same
evening
the
merchant
who
was
sending
them
back
to
bondage
without
the
slightest
inquiry
into
their
case
was
smoking
his
meerschaum
in
an
embroidered
on
a
luxurious
lounge
his
daughter
fitzgerald
in
azure
satin
and
pearls
was
meandering
through
the
mazes
of
the
dance
and
his
exquisitely
dressed
grandson
gerald
was
paying
nearly
equal
homage
to
king
lambent
eyes
and
the
sparkle
of
her
diamonds
when
young
fitzgerald
descended
to
a
late
breakfast
the
morning
after
the
great
party
his
grandfather
was
lolling
back
in
his
his
feet
ensconced
in
embroidered
slippers
and
resting
on
the
register
while
he
read
the
boston
courier
good
morning
gerald
said
he
if
it
be
not
past
that
time
of
day
if
you
are
sufficiently
rested
from
last
night
dissipation
i
should
like
to
have
you
attend
to
a
little
business
for
me
i
hope
it
wo
take
very
long
grandfather
replied
gerald
for
i
want
to
call
on
king
early
before
her
rooms
are
thronged
with
visitors
that
seems
to
have
turned
your
head
though
she
is
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
rejoined
bell
i
do
know
that
my
head
was
any
more
turned
than
others
answered
the
young
man
in
a
slightly
offended
tone
if
you
call
to
see
her
sir
as
mother
says
you
intend
to
do
perhaps
she
will
make
feel
as
if
you
had
a
young
head
on
your
shoulders
likely
as
not
likely
as
not
responded
the
old
gentleman
smiling
complacently
at
the
idea
of
the
beau
but
i
wish
you
to
do
an
errand
for
me
this
morning
which
i
had
rather
not
put
in
writing
for
fear
of
accidents
and
which
i
can
not
trust
verbally
to
a
servant
i
got
somewhat
chilled
waiting
in
a
carriage
near
the
wharf
last
evening
and
i
feel
some
rheumatic
twinges
in
consequence
under
these
circumstances
i
trust
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
ask
the
use
of
your
young
limbs
to
save
my
own
certainly
sir
replied
gerald
with
thinly
disguised
impatience
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
two
slaves
belonging
to
bruteman
of
new
orleans
formerly
a
friend
of
your
father
have
escaped
in
my
ship
king
cotton
the
oldest
it
seems
is
a
head
carpenter
and
would
bring
a
high
price
bruteman
values
them
at
hundred
dollars
he
is
my
debtor
to
a
considerable
amount
and
those
negroes
are
mortgaged
to
me
but
independently
of
that
circumstance
it
would
be
very
poor
policy
dealing
with
the
south
as
i
do
to
allow
negroes
to
be
brought
away
in
my
vessels
with
impunity
besides
there
is
a
heavy
penalty
in
all
the
southern
states
if
the
thing
is
proved
you
see
gerald
it
is
every
way
for
my
interest
to
make
sure
of
returning
those
negroes
and
your
interest
is
somewhat
connected
with
mine
seeing
that
the
small
pittance
saved
from
the
wreck
of
your
father
property
is
quite
insufficient
to
supply
your
rather
expensive
wants
i
think
i
have
been
reminded
of
that
often
enough
sir
to
be
in
no
danger
of
forgetting
it
retorted
the
youth
reddening
as
he
spoke
then
you
will
perhaps
think
it
no
great
hardship
to
transact
a
little
business
for
me
now
and
then
coolly
rejoined
the
grandfather
i
shall
send
orders
to
have
these
negroes
sold
as
soon
as
they
arrive
and
the
money
transmitted
to
me
for
when
they
once
begin
to
run
away
the
disease
is
apt
to
become
chronic
have
you
seen
them
sir
inquired
gerald
no
replied
the
merchant
that
would
have
been
unpleasant
without
being
of
any
use
when
a
disagreeable
duty
is
to
be
done
the
quicker
it
is
done
the
better
captain
kane
took
down
to
castle
island
last
night
but
it
wo
do
for
them
to
stay
there
the
abolitionists
will
ferret
out
and
be
down
there
with
their
devilish
i
want
you
to
go
on
board
king
cotton
take
the
captain
aside
and
tell
him
from
me
to
remove
them
forthwith
from
castle
island
keep
them
under
strong
guard
and
skulk
round
with
them
in
the
best
he
can
find
until
a
ship
passes
that
will
take
them
to
new
orleans
of
course
i
need
not
caution
you
to
be
silent
about
this
affair
especially
concerning
the
slaves
being
mortgaged
to
me
if
that
is
whispered
abroad
it
will
soon
get
into
the
abolition
papers
that
i
am
a
as
those
rascals
call
the
slaveholders
the
young
man
obeyed
his
instructions
to
the
letter
and
having
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
captain
kane
he
was
unable
to
dress
for
quite
so
early
a
call
at
the
revere
house
as
he
had
intended
how
much
trouble
these
niggers
give
us
thought
he
as
he
adjusted
his
embroidered
cravat
and
took
his
fresh
kid
gloves
from
the
box
when
blumenthal
went
home
to
dine
that
day
the
ladies
of
the
household
noticed
that
he
was
unusually
serious
as
he
sat
after
dinner
absently
playing
a
silent
tune
on
the
his
wife
touched
his
hand
with
her
napkin
and
said
was
it
so
long
ago
florimond
he
turned
and
smiled
upon
her
as
he
answered
so
my
fingers
were
moving
to
the
tune
of
long
ago
were
they
i
was
not
conscious
of
it
but
my
thoughts
were
with
the
long
ago
yesterday
afternoon
as
i
was
passing
across
state
street
i
heard
a
cry
of
thief
and
i
saw
them
seize
a
young
man
who
looked
like
an
italian
i
gave
no
further
thought
to
the
matter
and
pursued
the
business
i
had
in
hand
but
i
have
learned
that
he
was
a
slave
who
escaped
in
king
cotton
from
new
orleans
i
seem
to
see
the
poor
terrified
look
now
and
it
brings
vividly
to
mind
something
dreadful
that
came
very
near
happening
long
ago
to
a
person
whose
complexion
is
similar
to
his
i
was
thinking
how
willingly
i
would
then
have
given
the
services
of
my
whole
life
for
a
portion
of
the
money
which
our
best
friend
here
has
enabled
me
to
acquire
what
the
dreadful
thing
that
was
going
to
happen
papa
inquired
rosa
that
is
a
secret
between
mamma
and
i
he
replied
it
is
something
not
exactly
suitable
to
talk
with
little
girls
about
rosy
posy
he
took
her
hand
as
it
lay
on
the
table
and
pressed
it
affectionately
by
way
of
apology
for
refusing
his
confidence
then
looking
at
delano
he
said
if
i
had
only
known
the
poor
fellow
was
a
slave
i
might
perhaps
have
done
something
to
rescue
him
but
the
abolitionists
are
doing
what
can
be
done
they
procured
a
writ
of
and
went
on
board
king
cotton
but
they
could
neither
find
the
slaves
nor
obtain
any
information
from
the
captain
they
are
keeping
watch
on
all
vessels
bound
south
in
which
goldwin
and
i
are
assisting
them
there
are
at
least
twenty
spies
out
on
the
wharves
i
heartily
wish
you
as
much
success
as
i
have
had
in
that
kind
of
business
replied
delano
with
a
smile
o
i
do
hope
they
be
rescued
exclaimed
flora
how
shameful
it
is
to
have
such
laws
while
we
keep
singing
in
the
face
of
the
world
about
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
i
do
mean
to
sing
that
again
for
it
false
there
come
an
end
to
this
some
time
or
other
as
surely
as
god
reigns
in
the
heavens
rejoined
blumenthal
two
days
passed
and
the
unremitting
efforts
of
percival
and
jackson
proved
unavailing
to
obtain
any
clew
to
the
fugitives
after
an
anxious
consultation
with
samuel
sewall
the
wisest
and
kindest
legal
adviser
in
such
cases
they
reluctantly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
without
further
information
as
a
last
resort
percival
suggested
a
personal
appeal
to
bell
rather
a
forlorn
hope
that
replied
francis
jackson
he
has
named
his
ship
for
the
king
that
rules
over
us
all
trampling
on
freedom
of
petition
freedom
of
debate
and
even
on
freedom
of
locomotion
we
will
try
said
percival
it
is
barely
possible
we
may
obtain
some
light
on
the
subject
early
in
the
evening
they
accordingly
waited
upon
the
merchant
at
his
residence
when
the
servant
informed
him
that
two
gentlemen
wished
to
see
him
on
business
he
laid
aside
his
meerschaum
and
the
courier
and
said
show
them
in
captain
kane
had
informed
him
that
the
abolitionists
were
trying
to
get
up
a
row
but
he
had
not
anticipated
that
they
would
call
upon
him
and
it
was
an
unpleasant
surprise
when
he
saw
who
his
visitors
were
he
bowed
stiffly
and
waited
in
silence
for
them
to
explain
their
business
we
have
called
said
percival
to
make
some
inquiries
concerning
two
fugitives
from
slavery
who
it
is
said
were
found
on
board
your
ship
king
cotton
i
know
nothing
about
it
replied
bell
my
captains
understand
the
laws
of
the
ports
they
sail
from
and
it
is
their
business
to
see
that
those
laws
are
respected
but
urged
percival
that
a
man
is
as
a
slave
by
no
means
proves
that
he
a
slave
the
law
presumes
that
every
man
has
a
right
to
personal
liberty
until
it
is
proved
otherwise
and
in
order
to
secure
a
fair
trial
of
the
question
the
writ
of
has
been
provided
it
a
great
disgrace
to
massachusetts
sir
that
she
puts
so
many
obstacles
in
the
way
of
enforcing
the
laws
of
the
united
states
replied
bell
if
your
grandson
should
be
claimed
as
a
slave
i
rather
think
you
would
consider
the
writ
of
a
wise
and
just
provision
said
the
francis
jackson
it
is
said
that
this
young
stranger
whom
they
chased
as
a
thief
and
carried
off
as
a
slave
had
a
complexion
no
darker
than
his
i
take
it
for
granted
added
percival
that
you
do
not
wish
for
a
state
of
things
that
would
make
every
man
and
woman
in
massachusetts
liable
to
be
carried
off
as
slaves
without
a
chance
to
prove
their
right
to
freedom
bell
answered
in
tones
of
suppressed
anger
his
face
all
ablaze
with
excitement
if
i
could
choose
should
be
thus
carried
off
i
would
do
the
commonwealth
a
service
by
ridding
her
of
a
swarm
of
malignant
fanatics
if
you
were
to
try
that
game
quietly
rejoined
francis
jackson
i
apprehend
you
would
find
some
of
the
fire
of
still
alive
under
the
ashes
a
man
is
strongly
tempted
to
argue
said
percival
when
he
knows
that
all
the
laws
of
truth
and
justice
and
freedom
are
on
his
side
but
we
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
the
subject
of
slavery
bell
we
came
to
appeal
to
your
own
good
sense
whether
it
is

without

of

answered
bell
doggedly
i
presume
to
be
wiser
than
the
framers
of
that
venerable
document
that
is
evading
the
question
responded
percival
there
is
no
question
before
us
concerning
the
framers
of
the
constitution
the
simple
proposition
is
whether
it
is
right
or
safe
for
men
to
be
forcibly
carried
from
boston
without
process
of
law
two
strangers
been
thus
abducted
and
you
say
it
is
your
captain
business
you
know
perfectly
well
that
a
single
line
from
you
would
induce
your
captain
to
give
those
men
a
chance
for
a
fair
trial
is
it
not
your
duty
so
to
instruct
him
a
little
thrown
off
his

bell
exclaimed
and
give
an
abolition
mob
a
chance
to
rescue
them
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
it
is
not
the
abolitionists
who
get
up
mobs
rejoined
francis
jackson
garrison
was
dragged
through
the
streets
for
writing
against
slavery
but
when
yancey
of
alabama
had
the
use
of
faneuil
hall
for
the
purpose
of
defending
slavery
no
abolitionist
attempted
to
disturb
his
speaking
a
slight
smile
hovered
about
percival
lips
for
it
was
well
known
that
state
street
and
ann
street
clasped
hands
when
mobs
were
wanted
and
that
money
changed
palms
on
such
occasions
and
the
common
rumor
was
that
bell
purse
had
been
freely
used
the
merchant
probably
considered
it
an
offensive
insinuation
for
his
face
usually
rubicund
from
the
effects
of
champagne
and
oysters
became
redder
and
his
lips
were
tightly
compressed
but
he
merely
reiterated
i
stand
by
the
constitution
sir
bell
i
must
again
urge
it
upon
your
conscience
said
percival
that
you
are
more
responsible
than
the
captain
in
this
matter
your
captains
of
course
act
under
your
orders
and
would
do
nothing
contrary
to
your
expressed
wishes
captain
kane
has
doubtless
consulted
you
in
this
business
that
none
of
your
concern
sir
retorted
the
irascible
merchant
my
captains
know
that
i
think
southern
gentlemen
ought
to
be
protected
in
their
property
and
that
is
sufficient
i
stand
by
the
constitution
sir
i
honor
the
reverend
gentleman
who
said
he
was
ready
to
send
his
mother
or
his
brother
into
slavery
if
the
laws
required
it
that
the
proper
spirit
sir
you
fanatics
with
your
useless
abstractions
about
human
rights
are
injuring
trade
and
endangering
the
peace
of
the
country
you
are
doing
all
you
can
to
incite
the
slaves
to
insurrection
i
do
pretend
to
be
wiser
than
the
framers
of
the
constitution
sir
i
do
pretend
to
be
wiser
than
daniel
webster
sir
who
said
in
congress
that
he
would
support
to
the
fullest
extent
any
law
southern
gentlemen
chose
to
frame
for
the
recovery
of
fugitive
slaves
i
wish
you
a
better
rejoined
francis
jackson
rising
as
he
spoke
i
do
see
my
friend
that
there
any
use
in
staying
here
to
talk
any
longer
there
none
so
deaf
as
those
that
hear
percival
rose
at
this
suggestion
and
good
evening
was
exchanged
with
formal
bows
on
both
sides
but
sturdy
francis
jackson
made
no
bow
and
uttered
no
good
evening
when
they
were
in
the
street
and
the
subject
was
alluded
to
by
his
companion
he
simply
replied
i
pretty
much
done
with
saying
or
doing
what
i
mean
it
a
pity
that
grandson
of
his
could
be
carried
off
as
a
slave
that
might
perhaps
bring
him
to
a
realizing
sense
of
the
state
of
things
chapter
xxvii
a
few
days
past
the
middle
of
the
following
may
a
carriage
stopped
before
the
house
of
joseph
bright
in
northampton
and
delano
with
all
the
blumenthal
family
descended
from
it
mr
bright
received
them
at
the
gate
his
face
smiling
all
over
you
welcome
ladies
said
he
walk
in
walk
in
betsey
this
is
delano
this
is
mrs
bright
ladies
things
ai
so
stylish
here
as
at
your
house
but
i
hope
you
find
comfortable
mrs
bright
a
woman
with
great
moderation
of
manner
showed
them
into
a
plainly
furnished
but
very
neat
parlor
o
how
pleasant
this
is
exclaimed
blumenthal
as
she
looked
out
of
one
of
the
the
children
ran
up
to
her
repeating
how
pleasant
what
a
nice
hedge
mamma
and
see
that
wall
all
covered
with
pretty
flowers
those
are
said
mrs
bright
i
think
they
are
very
ornamental
to
a
wall
did
you
plant
them
inquired
rosa
o
no
said
mr
bright
who
was
bringing
in
various
baskets
and
shawls
that
not
our
garden
but
we
have
just
as
much
pleasure
looking
at
it
as
if
it
was
a
great
southern
nabob
lives
there
he
made
a
heap
o
money
selling
women
and
children
and
he
come
north
to
spend
it
he
a
very
pious
man
and
deacon
of
the
church
the
children
began
to
laugh
for
mr
bright
drawled
out
his
words
in
solemn
tones
and
made
his
broad
face
look
very
comical
by
trying
to
lengthen
it
his
name
is
stillham
added
he
but
i
call
him
deacon
as
he
passed
out
rosa
whispered
to
her
mother
what
does
he
mean
about
a
deacon
selling
women
and
children
before
an
answer
could
be
given
mr
bright
reappeared
with
a
i
guess
this
is
a
pretty
old
parrot
said
he
yes
she
is
quite
old
replied
delano
but
we
are
all
attached
to
her
and
our
house
being
shut
up
for
the
summer
we
were
unwilling
to
trust
her
with
strangers
the
parrot
conscious
of
being
talked
about
turned
up
her
head
sideways
and
winked
her
eye
without
stirring
from
the
corner
of
the
cage
where
she
was
rolled
up
like
a
ball
of
feathers
then
she
croaked
out
an
english
phrase
which
she
had
learned
of
the
children
polly
wants
a
cacker
she
shall
have
a
cracker
said
mr
bright
and
rosa
and
little
lila
were
soon
furnished
with
a
cracker
and
a
lump
of
sugar
for
poll
in
a
short
time
they
were
summoned
to
tea
and
after
enjoying
mrs
bright
light
bread
and
sweet
butter
they
saw
no
more
of
their
host
and
hostess
for
the
evening
in
the
morning
the
whole
family
were
up
before
the
hour
appointed
for
breakfast
and
were
out
in
the
garden
taking
a
look
at
the
environments
of
their
new
abode
as
blumenthal
was
walking
among
the
bushes
mr
bright
beaming
face
suddenly
uprose
before
her
from
where
he
was
stooping
to
pluck
up
some
weeds
good
morning
said
he
do
hear
that
old
thief
trying
to
come
paddy
over
the
lord
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
his
thumb
backward
toward
deacon
house
whence
proceeded
a
very
loud
and
monotonous
voice
of
prayer
blumenthal
smiled
as
she
inquired
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
he
sold
women
and
children
made
his
money
by
down
in
carolina
i
reckon
a
man
has
to
pray
a
deal
to
get
himself
out
of
that
scrape
needs
to
pray
pretty
loud
too
or
the
voice
of
women
screaming
for
their
babies
would
get
to
the
throne
afore
him
he
do
like
us
over
and
above
well
we
abolitionists
but
there
betsey
calling
me
i
must
stop
here
talking
blumenthal
amused
her
companions
by
a
repetition
of
his
remarks
concerning
the
deacon
she
was
much
entertained
by
their
original
style
of
bubbling
over
as
she
termed
it
after
breakfast
she
said
there
he
is
in
the
garden
let
go
and
talk
with
him
florimond
and
taking
her
parasol
she
went
out
leaning
on
her
husband
arm
so
you
are
an
abolitionist
said
blumenthal
as
they
stopped
near
their
host
mr
bright
tossed
his
hat
on
a
bush
and
leaning
on
his
hoe
sang
in
a
stentorian
voice
i
am
an
abolitionist
i
glory
in
the
there
said
he
laughing
i
let
out
my
voice
that
the
deacon
might
hear
he
can
pray
the
loudest
but
i
reckon
i
can
sing
the
loudest
i
tell
you
what
first
made
me
begin
to
think
about
slavery
you
see
i
was
never
easy
without
i
could
be
doing
something
in
the
musical
way
so
i
undertook
to
teach
singing
one
winter
i
thought
i
should
like
to
run
away
from
jack
frost
and
i
looked
in
the
southern
papers
to
see
if
any
of
advertised
for
a
the
first
thing
my
eye
lighted
on
was
this
advertisement
ran
away
from
the
subscriber
a
stout
mulatto
slave
named
joe
has
light
sandy
hair
blue
eyes
and
ruddy
complexion
is
intelligent
and
will
pass
himself
for
a
white
man
i
will
give
one
hundred
reward
to
whoever
will
seize
him
and
put
him
in
jail
george
said
i
a
description
of
i
did
know
before
that
i
was
a
mulatto
it
never
do
for
me
to
go
so
i
went
to
vermont
to
teach
i
told
i
was
a
runaway
slave
and
showed
the
advertisement
that
described
me
some
of
believed
me
till
i
told
it
was
a
joke
well
it
is
just
as
bad
for
those
poor
black
fellows
as
it
would
have
been
for
me
but
that
joe
seemed
to
bring
the
matter
home
to
me
it
set
me
to
thinking
about
slavery
and
i
have
kept
thinking
ever
since
not
exactly
such
a
silent
thinking
as
the
apothecary
famous
owl
i
judge
said
blumenthal
no
replied
he
laughing
i
never
had
the
quaker
gift
of
gathering
into
the
stillness
that
a
fact
but
i
reckon
even
that
owl
would
be
silent
if
he
could
hear
and
understand
all
that
betsey
has
told
me
about
the
down
south
before
i
married
her
she
went
there
to
teach
but
she
a
woman
o
feeling
and
she
stand
it
long
but
dear
me
if
i
believed
deacon
talk
i
should
think
it
was
just
about
the
pleasantest
thing
in
the
world
to
be
sold
and
that
the
niggers
down
south
had
nothing
earth
to
do
but
to
lick
treacle
and
swing
on
a
gate
then
he
proves
it
to
be
a
divine
institution
from
scripture
chapter
and
verse
you
may
have
noticed
perhaps
that
such
chaps
are
always
mighty
well
posted
up
about
the
original
designs
of
providence
especially
as
to
foreordained
to
be
kept
down
he
says
god
cussed
ham
and
the
niggers
are
the
descendants
of
ham
i
told
him
if
there
was
an
estate
of
left
unsettled
i
reckoned
would
puzzle
the
lawyer
to
hunt
up
the
rightful
heirs
i
think
so
rejoined
blumenthal
smiling
especially
when
they
become
so
mixed
up
that
they
advertise
runaway
negroes
with
sandy
hair
blue
eyes
and
ruddy
complexion
when
the
deacon
feels
the
ground
a
little
shaky
under
him
resumed
mr
bright
he
leans
on
his
minister
down
in
carolina
who
he
says
is
a
northern
man
and
so
pious
that
folks
come
from
far
and
near
to
get
him
to
pray
for
rain
in
a
dry
time
thinking
the
prayers
of
such
a
godly
man
will
be
sure
to
bring
down
the
showers
he
says
that
man
preached
a
sermon
that
proved
niggers
were
born
to
be
servants
of
servants
unto
their
brethren
i
told
him
i
did
doubt
that
part
of
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
about
their
serving
their
and
i
showed
him
the
advertisement
about
sandy
hair
and
blue
eyes
but
as
for
being
servants
of
i
never
heard
of
slaveholders
serving
anybody
except
a
chap
whose
name
it
ai
polite
to
mention
before
ladies
as
for
that
preacher
he
put
me
in
mind
of
a
minister
my
father
used
to
tell
of
he
been
to
a
wedding
and
when
he
come
home
he
could
light
his
lamp
after
trying
a
long
spell
he
found
out
that
the
extinguisher
was
on
it
i
told
the
deacon
that
ministers
down
south
had
put
an
extinguisher
on
their
lamp
and
could
be
expected
to
raise
much
of
a
light
from
it
to
guide
anybody
steps
some
of
the
northern
ministers
are
not
much
better
guides
i
think
rejoined
blumenthal
just
so
replied
his
host
they
got
the
same
extinguisher
on
and
ai
it
curious
to
see
puffing
and
blowing
at
the
old
lamp
i
get
tired
of
talking
common
sense
and
common
feeling
to
the
deacon
you
ca
get
it
into
him
and
it
wo
stay
on
him
you
might
as
well
try
to
heap
a
peck
o
he
keeps
eating
his
own
words
too
though
they
do
seem
to
agree
with
him
neither
he
maintains
that
the
slaves
are
perfectly
contented
and
happy
and
the
next
minute
if
you
quote
any
of
their
cruel
laws
he
tells
you
they
are
obliged
to
make
such
laws
or
else
they
would
rise
and
cut
their
masters
throats
he
says
blacks
and
whites
wo
mix
any
more
than
oil
and
water
and
the
next
minute
he
says
if
the
slaves
are
freed
they
marry
our
daughters
i
tell
him
his
arguments
are
like
the
kilkenny
cats
that
ate
one
another
up
to
the
tip
o
their
tails
the
deacon
is
sensible
enough
too
about
many
other
subjects
but
he
nor
no
other
man
can
saw
straight
with
a
crooked
saw
it
an
old
saying
rejoined
blumenthal
that
when
men
enter
into
a
league
with
satan
he
always
deserts
them
at
the
tightest
pinch
and
i
often
observed
he
sure
to
do
it
where
arguments
pinch
i
do
wonder
you
are
far
from
being
a
favorite
with
the
deacon
remarked
flora
for
according
to
your
own
account
you
hit
him
rather
hard
i
suppose
i
do
rejoined
mr
bright
i
always
in
earnest
myself
and
when
i
sure
i
in
the
right
i
always
drive
ahead
i
soon
get
out
o
patience
trying
to
twist
a
string
that
ai
fastened
at
nary
end
as
an
old
neighbor
of
my
father
used
to
say
i
suppose
some
of
us
abolitionists
a
little
rough
at
times
but
i
reckon
the
coarsest
of
us
do
more
good
than
the
false
prophets
that
prophesy
smooth
things
you
said
mrs
bright
had
been
a
teacher
in
the
south
what
part
of
the
south
was
it
inquired
blumenthal
she
went
to
savannah
to
be
nursery
governess
to
little
girl
replied
he
but
part
of
the
time
she
was
on
an
island
where
fitzgerald
had
a
cotton
plantation
i
dare
say
you
heard
of
him
for
he
married
the
daughter
of
that
rich
bell
who
lives
in
your
street
he
died
some
years
ago
at
least
they
suppose
he
died
but
nobody
knows
what
became
of
him
flora
pressed
her
husband
arm
and
was
about
to
inquire
concerning
the
mystery
when
delano
came
hand
in
hand
with
rosa
and
lila
to
say
that
she
had
ordered
the
carriage
and
wanted
them
to
be
in
readiness
to
take
a
drive
they
returned
to
a
late
dinner
and
when
they
rose
from
a
long
chat
over
the
dessert
mr
bright
was
not
to
be
found
and
his
wife
was
busy
so
further
inquiries
concerning
fitzgerald
fate
were
postponed
blumenthal
proposed
a
walk
on
round
hill
but
the
children
preferred
staying
at
home
rosa
had
a
new
tune
she
wanted
to
practise
with
her
guitar
and
her
little
sister
had
the
promise
of
a
story
from
mamita
lila
so
blumenthal
and
his
wife
went
forth
on
their
ramble
alone
the
scene
from
round
hill
was
beautiful
with
the
tender
foliage
of
early
spring
slowly
they
sauntered
round
from
point
to
point
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
at
the
handsome
villages
before
them
at
the
blooming
the
glistening
river
and
the
venerable
mountains
with
feathery
crowns
of
violet
cloud
suddenly
a
sound
of
music
floated
on
the
air
and
they
stood
with
heads
bowed
as
if
their
souls
were
hushed
in
prayer
when
it
ceased
blumenthal
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
ah
that
was
our
mendelssohn
how
exquisitely
it
was
played
observed
his
wife
and
how
in
harmony
it
was
with
these
groves
it
sounded
like
a
hymn
in
the
forest
they
lingered
hoping
again
to
hear
the
invisible
musician
as
they
leaned
against
the
trees
the
silver
orb
of
the
moon
ascended
from
the
horizon
and
rested
on
the
brow
of
mount
holyoke
and
from
the
same
quarter
whence
mendelssohn
song
without
words
had
proceeded
the
tones
of
casta
diva
rose
upon
the
air
flora
seized
her
arm
with
a
quick
convulsive
grasp
and
trembled
all
over
wondering
at
the
intensity
of
her
emotion
he
passed
his
arm
tenderly
round
her
waist
and
drew
her
closely
to
him
thus
leaning
upon
his
heart
she
listened
with
her
whole
being
from
the
inmost
recesses
of
her
soul
throughout
all
her
nerves
to
her
very
fingers
ends
when
the
sounds
died
away
she
sobbed
out
o
how
like
rosa
voice
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
risen
from
the
dead
he
spoke
soothingly
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
descended
the
hill
and
silently
wended
their
way
homeward
the
voice
that
had
seemed
to
come
from
another
world
invested
the
evening
landscape
with
mystical
solemnity
the
expression
of
the
moon
seemed
transfigured
like
a
great
clairvoyant
eye
reflecting
light
from
invisible
spheres
and
looking
out
upon
the
external
world
with
dreamy
abstraction
when
they
arrived
at
their
lodgings
flora
exclaimed
o
mamita
lila
we
have
heard
such
heavenly
music
and
a
voice
so
wonderfully
like
rosa
i
do
believe
i
shall
sleep
a
wink
do
you
mean
the
aunt
rosa
i
was
named
for
inquired
her
daughter
yes
rosen
blumen
replied
her
mother
and
i
wish
you
had
gone
with
us
that
you
might
have
an
idea
what
a
wonderful
voice
she
had
this
led
to
talk
about
old
times
and
to
the
singing
of
various
airs
associated
with
those
times
when
they
retired
to
rest
flora
fell
asleep
with
those
tunes
marching
and
dancing
through
her
brain
and
for
the
first
time
during
many
years
she
dreamed
of
playing
them
to
her
father
while
rosabella
sang
the
next
morning
when
the
children
had
gone
out
to
ramble
in
the
woods
with
their
father
her
memory
being
full
of
those
old
times
she
began
to
say
over
to
the
parrot
some
of
the
phrases
that
formerly
amused
her
father
and
rosabella
the
old
bird
was
never
talkative
now
but
when
urged
by
flora
she
croaked
out
some
of
her
familiar
phrases
i
glad
we
brought
with
us
said
blumenthal
i
think
she
seems
livelier
since
she
came
here
sometimes
i
fancy
she
looks
like
good
madame
guirlande
those
feathers
on
her
head
make
me
think
of
the
bows
on
madame
cap
come
i
carry
you
out
doors
where
the
sun
will
shine
upon
you
you
like
sunshine
you
manon
she
took
the
cage
and
was
busy
fastening
it
on
the
bough
of
a
tree
when
a
voice
from
the
street
said
jour
jolie
the
parrot
suddenly
flapped
her
wings
gave
a
loud
laugh
and
burst
into
a
perfect
tornado
of
french
and
spanish
phrases
jour
buenos
dias
querida
mia
joli
diable
petit
blanc
ha
surprised
at
this
explosion
blumenthal
looked
round
to
discover
the
cause
and
exclaiming
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
rushed
into
the
house
what
the
matter
my
child
inquired
delano
anxiously
o
mamita
i
seen
rosa
ghost
she
replied
sinking
into
a
chair
delano
poured
some
cologne
on
a
handkerchief
and
bathed
her
forehead
while
she
said
you
were
excited
last
night
by
the
tune
you
used
to
hear
your
sister
sing
and
it
makes
you
nervous
dear
while
she
was
speaking
mrs
bright
entered
the
room
saying
have
you
a
bottle
of
sal
volatile
you
can
lend
me
a
lady
has
come
in
who
says
she
is
a
little
faint
i
will
bring
it
from
my
chamber
replied
delano
she
left
the
room
and
was
gone
some
time
when
she
returned
she
found
blumenthal
leaning
her
head
on
the
table
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
my
child
i
want
you
to
come
into
the
other
room
said
delano
the
lady
who
was
faint
is
the
famous
king
from
boston
she
is
boarding
on
round
hill
and
i
suppose
it
was
her
voice
you
heard
singing
she
said
she
had
seen
a
lady
come
into
this
house
who
looked
so
much
like
a
deceased
relative
that
it
made
her
feel
faint
now
do
be
excited
darling
but
this
lady
certainly
resembles
the
sketch
you
made
of
your
sister
and
it
is
barely
possible
before
she
could
finish
the
sentence
flora
started
up
and
flew
into
the
adjoining
room
a
short
quick
cry
o
floracita
o
rosabella
and
they
were
locked
in
each
other
arms
after
hugging
and
kissing
and
weeping
and
laughing
by
turns
king
said
that
must
have
been
madame
parrot
the
sight
of
her
made
me
think
of
old
times
and
i
said
jour
jolie
your
back
was
toward
me
and
i
should
have
passed
on
if
my
attention
had
not
been
arrested
by
her
wild
outpouring
of
french
and
spanish
i
suppose
she
knew
my
voice
bless
the
dear
old
bird
exclaimed
flora
it
was
she
who
brought
us
together
again
at
last
she
shall
come
in
to
see
you
they
went
out
to
bring
in
their
old
pet
but
was
lying
on
the
floor
of
her
cage
with
eyes
closed
and
wings
outstretched
the
joyful
surprise
had
been
too
much
for
her
feeble
old
nerves
she
was
dead
chapter
xxviii
so
you
alive
exclaimed
rosa
holding
her
sister
back
a
little
and
gazing
upon
her
face
with
all
her
soul
in
her
eyes
yes
very
alive
answered
flora
with
a
smile
that
brought
out
all
her
dimples
but
do
tell
me
said
rosa
how
you
came
to
go
away
so
strangely
and
leave
me
to
mourn
for
you
as
if
you
were
dead
the
dimples
disappeared
and
a
shadow
clouded
flora
expressive
eyes
as
she
replied
it
would
take
a
long
while
to
explain
all
that
we
will
talk
it
over
another
time
please
rosa
sighed
as
she
pressed
her
sister
hand
and
said
perhaps
i
have
already
conjectured
rightly
about
it
floracita
my
eyes
were
opened
by
bitter
experiences
after
we
were
parted
some
time
i
will
explain
to
you
how
i
came
to
run
to
europe
in
such
a
hurry
with
madame
and
the
signor
but
tell
me
the
first
thing
of
all
whether
tulee
is
dead
rejoined
flora
you
know
madame
was
always
exceedingly
careful
about
expense
responded
rosa
duroy
was
willing
to
board
tulee
for
her
work
and
madame
thought
it
was
most
prudent
to
leave
her
there
till
we
got
established
in
europe
and
could
send
for
her
and
just
when
we
were
expecting
her
to
rejoin
us
letters
came
informing
us
that
and
duroy
and
tulee
all
died
of
it
distresses
me
beyond
measure
to
think
of
our
having
left
poor
faithful
tulee
when
we
found
out
that
fitzgerald
had
married
another
wife
replied
flora
my
new
mamita
kindly
volunteered
to
go
with
me
in
search
of
you
and
tulee
we
went
to
the
cottage
and
to
the
plantation
and
to
new
orleans
everybody
i
ever
knew
seemed
to
be
dead
or
gone
away
but
madame
parrot
was
alive
and
her
chattering
led
me
into
a
stranger
house
where
i
heard
that
you
were
lost
at
sea
on
your
way
to
europe
and
that
tulee
with
a
white
baby
she
had
charge
of
had
died
of
was
that
baby
yours
dear
rosa
lowered
her
eyes
and
colored
deeply
as
she
answered
that
subject
is
very
painful
to
me
i
can
never
forgive
myself
for
having
left
tulee
and
that
poor
little
baby
flora
pressed
her
sister
hand
in
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
said
you
told
me
madame
and
the
signor
were
alive
and
well
where
are
they
they
lived
with
us
in
provence
replied
rosa
but
when
we
concluded
to
return
to
america
the
signor
expressed
a
wish
to
end
his
days
in
his
native
country
so
king
purchased
an
estate
for
them
near
florence
and
settled
an
annuity
upon
them
i
had
a
letter
from
madame
a
few
days
ago
and
she
writes
that
they
are
as
happy
as
rabbits
in
clover
the
signor
is
getting
quite
old
and
if
she
survives
him
it
is
agreed
that
she
will
come
and
end
her
days
with
us
how
it
will
delight
her
heart
to
hear
that
you
are
alive
what
a
strange
fortune
we
have
had
it
seems
that
king
always
loved
me
from
the
first
evening
that
he
spent
at
our
house
do
you
remember
how
you
laughed
because
he
offered
to
help
us
if
ever
we
were
in
trouble
he
knew
more
about
us
then
than
we
knew
about
ourselves
and
he
afterward
did
help
me
out
of
very
great
troubles
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
some
time
but
first
i
want
to
know
about
you
who
is
this
new
mamita
that
you
speak
of
o
it
was
wonderful
how
she
came
to
me
when
i
had
the
greatest
need
of
a
friend
answered
flora
you
must
know
that
she
and
papasito
were
in
love
with
each
other
when
they
were
young
and
she
is
in
love
with
his
memory
now
i
sometimes
think
his
spirit
led
her
to
me
i
will
show
you
a
picture
i
have
made
of
papasito
and
mamita
as
guardian
angels
placing
a
crown
of
violets
and
lilies
of
the
valley
on
the
head
of
my
new
mamita
when
i
had
to
run
away
she
brought
me
to
live
with
her
in
boston
and
there
i
met
with
an
old
acquaintance
do
you
remember
florimond
blumenthal
the
good
german
boy
that
papasito
took
such
an
interest
in
inquired
rosa
to
be
sure
i
remember
him
well
he
a
good
german
boy
now
rejoined
flora
and
i
mrs
blumenthal
is
it
possible
exclaimed
rosa
you
look
so
exactly
as
you
did
when
you
were
such
a
merry
little
elf
that
i
never
thought
to
inquire
whether
you
were
married
in
the
joy
of
this
sudden
meeting
i
forgot
how
many
years
had
passed
since
we
saw
each
other
you
will
realize
how
long
it
has
been
when
you
see
my
children
rejoined
flora
my
oldest
alfred
royal
is
fitting
for
college
he
is
the
image
of
and
you
will
see
how
mamita
lila
doats
upon
him
she
must
have
loved
papasito
very
much
then
i
had
a
daughter
that
died
in
a
few
days
then
i
had
my
rosen
blumen
and
you
will
see
who
she
looks
like
then
some
more
came
and
went
to
the
angels
last
of
all
came
little
lila
who
looks
just
like
her
father
flaxen
hair
pink
cheeks
and
great
german
for
eyes
how
i
shall
love
them
all
exclaimed
rosa
and
you
will
love
our
eulalia
i
had
a
little
alfred
and
a
little
flora
they
came
to
us
in
provence
and
we
left
their
pretty
little
bodies
there
among
the
roses
the
sisters
sat
folded
in
each
other
arms
their
souls
wandering
about
among
memories
when
blumenthal
returned
from
his
long
ramble
with
the
children
then
of
course
there
was
a
scene
of
exclamations
and
embraces
little
lila
was
shy
and
soon
ran
away
to
take
refuge
in
mamita
chamber
but
rosen
blumen
was
full
of
wonder
and
delight
that
such
a
grand
beautiful
lady
was
the
aunt
rosa
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
much
mamita
lila
has
stayed
away
all
this
time
out
of
regard
to
our
privacy
said
flora
but
now
i
am
going
to
bring
her
she
soon
returned
arm
in
arm
with
delano
blumenthal
took
her
hand
respectfully
as
she
entered
and
said
this
is
our
dear
benefactress
our
best
earthly
friend
my
guardian
angel
my
darling
mamita
added
flora
king
eagerly
stepped
forward
and
folded
her
in
her
arms
saying
in
a
voice
half
stifled
with
emotion
thank
god
and
you
for
all
this
happiness
while
they
were
speaking
together
flora
held
a
whispered
consultation
with
her
husband
who
soon
went
forth
in
search
of
king
with
strict
injunctions
to
say
merely
that
an
unexpected
pleasure
awaited
him
he
hastened
to
obey
the
summons
wondering
what
it
could
mean
there
was
no
need
of
introducing
him
to
his
relative
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
he
exclaimed
why
floracita
so
you
knew
me
she
said
clasping
his
hand
warmly
to
be
sure
i
did
he
answered
you
are
the
same
little
fairy
that
danced
in
the
floral
parlor
o
i
a
sober
matron
now
said
she
with
a
comic
attempt
to
look
demure
about
the
mouth
while
her
eyes
were
laughing
here
is
my
daughter
rosa
and
i
have
a
tall
lad
who
bears
two
thirds
of
your
regal
name
the
happy
group
were
loath
to
separate
though
it
was
only
to
meet
again
in
the
evening
at
king
lodgings
on
round
hill
there
memories
and
feelings
that
tried
in
vain
to
express
themselves
fully
in
words
found
eloquent
utterance
in
music
day
after
day
and
evening
after
evening
the
sisters
met
with
a
hunger
of
the
heart
that
could
not
be
satisfied
their
husbands
and
children
meanwhile
became
mutually
attached
rosen
blumen
richly
colored
with
her
tropical
ancestry
and
her
vigorous
health
looked
upon
her
more
ethereal
cousin
eulalia
as
a
sort
of
angel
and
seemed
to
worship
her
as
such
sometimes
she
accompanied
her
sweet
voice
with
the
guitar
sometimes
they
sang
duets
together
and
sometimes
one
played
on
the
piano
while
the
other
danced
with
lila
whose
tiny
feet
kept
time
to
the
music
true
as
an
echo
not
unfrequently
the
pretty
little
creature
was
called
upon
to
dance
a
for
she
had
improvised
a
dance
for
herself
to
the
tune
of
yankee
doodle
and
it
was
very
amusing
to
see
how
emphatically
she
stamped
the
rhythm
while
the
young
people
amused
themselves
thus
flora
often
brought
forward
her
collection
of
drawings
which
rosa
called
the
portfolio
of
memories
there
was
the
little
fountain
in
their
father
garden
the
lonely
cottage
on
the
island
the
skeleton
of
the
dead
pine
tree
with
the
moon
peeping
through
its
streamers
of
moss
and
thistle
with
his
panniers
full
of
flowers
among
the
variety
of
foreign
scenes
king
particularly
admired
the
dancing
peasants
from
frascati
ah
said
flora
i
see
them
now
just
as
they
looked
when
we
passed
them
on
our
beautiful
drive
to
albano
it
was
the
first
really
merry
day
i
had
had
for
a
long
time
i
was
just
beginning
to
learn
to
enjoy
myself
without
you
it
was
very
selfish
of
me
dear
rosa
but
i
was
forgetful
of
you
that
day
and
only
to
think
of
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
unlucky
apparition
of
fitzgerald
i
should
have
gone
to
the
opera
and
seen
you
as
norma
very
likely
we
should
both
have
fainted
rejoined
rosa
and
then
the
manager
would
have
refused
to
let
la
campaneo
try
her
luck
again
but
what
is
this
floracita
that
is
a
group
on
monte
pincio
she
replied
i
sketched
it
when
i
was
shut
up
in
my
room
the
day
before
you
came
out
in
the
opera
i
do
believe
it
is
madame
and
the
signor
and
i
responded
rosa
the
figures
and
the
dresses
are
exactly
the
same
and
i
remember
we
went
to
monte
pincio
that
morning
on
my
return
from
rehearsal
what
a
stupid
donkey
i
was
not
to
know
you
were
so
near
said
flora
i
should
have
thought
my
fingers
would
have
told
me
while
i
was
drawing
it
ah
exclaimed
rosa
here
is
tulee
her
eyes
moistened
while
she
gazed
upon
it
poor
tulee
said
she
how
she
cared
for
me
and
comforted
me
during
those
dark
and
dreadful
days
if
it
had
been
for
her
and
chloe
i
could
never
have
lived
through
that
trouble
when
i
began
to
recover
she
told
me
how
chloe
held
my
hand
hour
after
hour
and
prayed
over
me
without
ceasing
i
believe
she
prayed
me
up
out
of
the
grave
she
said
our
mamita
appeared
to
her
once
and
told
her
she
was
my
guardian
angel
but
if
it
had
really
been
our
mamita
i
think
she
would
have
told
her
to
tell
me
you
were
alive
mignonne
when
alfred
and
i
went
south
just
before
we
came
here
we
tried
to
find
tom
and
chloe
we
intend
to
go
to
new
bedford
soon
to
see
them
a
glimpse
of
their
black
faces
would
give
me
more
pleasure
than
all
the
richly
dressed
ladies
i
saw
at
green
great
party
very
likely
you
hear
tom
preach
when
you
go
to
new
bedford
rejoined
flora
for
he
is
a
methodist
minister
now
and
chloe
they
say
is
powerful
in
prayer
at
the
meetings
i
often
smile
when
i
think
about
the
manner
of
her
coming
away
it
was
so
funny
that
my
quiet
refined
mamita
lila
should
all
at
once
become
a
kidnapper
but
here
is
rosen
blumen
well
what
now
mignonne
papa
says
lila
is
very
sleepy
and
we
ought
to
be
going
home
replied
the
young
damsel
then
we
will
kiss
good
night
said
blumenthal
and
you
will
bring
eulalia
to
us
on
their
return
home
mr
bright
called
to
them
over
the
garden
fence
i
just
had
a
letter
from
your
neighbor
fitzgerald
said
he
she
wants
to
know
whether
we
can
accommodate
her
and
her
father
and
her
son
with
lodgings
this
summer
i
mighty
glad
we
can
say
let
all
our
rooms
for
that
old
bell
treats
mechanics
as
if
he
thought
they
all
had
the
and
he
was
afraid
o
catching
it
so
different
from
you
blumenthal
and
king
you
ai
afraid
to
take
hold
of
a
rough
hand
without
a
glove
on
how
is
king
hope
she
coming
if
the
thrushes
and
bobolinks
could
sing
human
music
and
put
human
feeling
into
it
her
voice
would
beat
all
how
romantic
that
you
should
come
here
to
joe
bright
to
find
your
sister
that
you
thought
was
dead
when
they
had
courteously
answered
his
inquiries
he
repeated
a
wish
he
had
often
expressed
that
somebody
would
write
a
story
about
it
if
he
had
been
aware
of
all
their
antecedents
he
would
perhaps
have
written
one
himself
but
he
only
knew
that
the
handsome
sisters
were
orphans
separated
in
youth
and
led
by
a
singular
combination
of
circumstances
to
suppose
each
other
dead
chapter
xxix
when
the
sisters
were
alone
together
the
next
day
after
dinner
flora
said
rosa
dear
does
it
pain
you
very
much
to
hear
about
mr
fitzgerald
no
that
wound
has
healed
she
replied
it
is
merely
a
sad
memory
now
mrs
bright
was
nursery
governess
in
his
family
before
her
marriage
rejoined
flora
i
suppose
you
have
heard
that
he
disappeared
mysteriously
i
think
she
may
know
something
about
it
and
i
have
been
intending
to
ask
her
but
your
sudden
appearance
and
the
quantity
of
things
we
have
had
to
say
to
each
other
have
driven
it
out
of
my
head
do
you
object
to
my
asking
her
to
come
in
and
tell
us
something
about
her
experiences
i
should
be
unwilling
to
have
her
know
we
were
ever
acquainted
with
fitzgerald
responded
king
so
should
i
said
flora
it
will
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
my
curiosity
that
fitzgerald
is
our
acquaintance
and
neighbor
and
she
went
out
to
ask
her
hostess
to
come
and
sit
with
them
after
some
general
conversation
flora
said
you
know
fitzgerald
is
our
neighbor
in
boston
i
have
some
curiosity
to
know
what
were
your
experiences
in
her
family
fitzgerald
was
always
very
polite
to
me
replied
mrs
bright
and
personally
i
had
no
occasion
to
find
fault
with
fitzgerald
though
i
think
the
yankee
was
rather
a
bore
to
him
the
south
is
a
beautiful
part
of
the
country
i
used
to
think
the
where
they
spent
most
of
the
summer
was
as
beautiful
as
paradise
before
the
fall
but
i
never
felt
at
home
there
i
like
the
state
of
things
it
my
theory
that
everybody
ought
to
help
in
doing
the
work
of
the
world
there
a
great
deal
to
be
done
ladies
and
it
do
seem
right
that
some
backs
should
be
broken
with
labor
while
others
have
the
spine
complaint
for
want
of
exercise
it
did
agree
with
my
independent
new
england
habits
to
be
waited
upon
so
much
a
negro
woman
named
venus
took
care
of
my
room
the
first
night
i
slept
at
the
plantation
it
annoyed
me
to
see
her
kneel
down
to
take
off
my
stockings
and
shoes
i
told
her
she
might
go
for
i
could
undress
myself
she
seemed
surprised
and
i
think
her
conclusion
was
that
i
was
no
lady
but
all
the
negroes
liked
me
they
had
got
the
idea
somehow
that
northern
people
were
their
friends
and
were
doing
something
to
set
them
free
then
they
generally
wanted
their
freedom
did
they
inquired
flora
to
be
sure
they
did
rejoined
mrs
bright
did
you
ever
hear
of
anybody
that
liked
being
a
slave
king
asked
whether
fitzgerald
was
a
hard
master
i
do
think
he
was
said
their
hostess
i
have
known
him
to
do
very
generous
and
kind
things
for
his
servants
but
early
habits
had
made
him
indolent
and
selfish
and
he
left
the
overseer
to
do
as
he
liked
besides
though
he
was
a
pleasant
gentleman
when
sober
he
was
violent
when
he
was
intoxicated
and
he
had
become
much
addicted
to
intemperance
before
i
went
there
they
said
he
had
been
a
very
handsome
man
but
he
was
red
and
bloated
when
i
knew
him
he
had
a
dissipated
circle
of
acquaintances
who
used
to
meet
at
his
house
in
savannah
and
gamble
with
cards
till
late
into
the
night
and
the
liquor
they
drank
often
made
them
very
boisterous
and
quarrelsome
fitzgerald
never
made
any
remark
in
my
presence
about
these
doings
but
i
am
sure
they
troubled
her
for
i
often
heard
her
walking
her
chamber
long
after
she
had
retired
for
the
night
indeed
they
made
such
an
uproar
that
it
was
difficult
to
sleep
till
they
were
gone
sometimes
after
they
had
broken
up
i
heard
them
talking
on
the
piazza
and
their
oaths
and
obscene
jests
were
shocking
to
hear
yet
if
i
met
any
of
them
the
next
day
they
appeared
like
courtly
gentlemen
when
they
were
intoxicated
niggers
and
abolitionists
seemed
always
to
haunt
their
imaginations
i
remember
one
night
in
particular
i
judged
by
their
conversation
that
they
had
been
reading
in
a
northern
newspaper
some
discussion
about
allowing
slaveholders
to
partake
of
the
sacrament
their
talk
was
a
strange
tipsy
jumble
if
mr
bright
had
heard
it
he
would
give
you
a
comical
account
of
it
as
they
went
stumbling
down
the
steps
some
were
singing
and
some
were
swearing
i
heard
one
of
them
bawl
out
damn
their
souls
to
all
eternity
they
going
to
exclude
us
from
the
when
i
first
told
the
story
to
mr
bright
i
said
d
their
souls
but
he
said
that
was
all
a
sham
for
everybody
knew
what
d
stood
for
and
it
was
just
like
showing
an
ass
face
to
avoid
speaking
his
name
so
i
have
spoken
the
word
right
out
plain
just
as
i
heard
it
it
was
shocking
talk
to
hear
and
you
may
think
it
very
improper
to
repeat
it
ladies
but
i
have
told
it
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
state
of
things
in
the
midst
of
which
i
found
myself
king
listened
in
sad
silence
the
fitzgerald
of
this
description
was
so
unlike
the
elegant
young
gentleman
who
had
won
her
girlish
love
that
she
could
not
recognize
him
as
the
same
person
did
fitzgerald
die
before
you
left
inquired
flora
i
do
know
when
or
how
he
died
replied
mrs
bright
but
i
have
my
suspicions
out
of
regard
to
fitzgerald
i
have
never
mentioned
them
to
any
one
but
my
husband
and
if
i
name
them
to
you
ladies
i
trust
you
will
consider
it
strictly
confidential
they
promised
and
she
resumed
i
never
pried
into
the
secrets
of
the
family
but
i
could
not
help
learning
something
about
them
partly
from
my
own
observation
and
inferences
drawn
therefrom
and
partly
from
the
conversation
of
venus
my
talkative
she
told
me
that
her
master
married
a
spanish
lady
the
most
beautiful
lady
that
ever
walked
the
earth
and
that
he
conveyed
her
away
secretly
somewhere
after
he
married
the
as
she
called
fitzgerald
venus
was
still
when
i
knew
her
from
her
frequent
remarks
i
judge
that
when
she
was
young
her
master
thought
her
extremely
pretty
and
she
frequently
assured
me
that
he
was
a
great
judge
we
far
sex
she
had
a
handsome
mulatto
daughter
whose
features
greatly
resembled
his
and
she
said
there
was
good
reason
for
it
i
used
to
imagine
fitzgerald
thought
so
too
for
she
always
seemed
to
owe
this
handsome
nelly
a
grudge
fitzgerald
had
a
named
jim
who
was
so
genteel
that
i
always
called
him
jim
o
caroline
jim
and
nelly
were
in
love
with
each
other
but
their
master
for
reasons
of
his
own
forbade
their
meeting
together
finding
that
nelly
tried
to
elude
his
vigilance
he
sold
jim
to
a
new
orleans
trader
and
the
poor
girl
almost
cried
her
handsome
eyes
out
a
day
or
two
after
he
was
sold
fitzgerald
and
his
lady
went
to
beaufort
on
a
visit
and
took
their
little
son
and
daughter
with
them
the
walls
of
my
were
to
be
repaired
and
i
was
told
to
occupy
their
chamber
during
their
absence
the
evening
after
they
went
away
i
sat
up
rather
late
reading
and
when
i
retired
the
servants
were
all
asleep
as
i
sat
before
the
arranging
my
hair
for
the
night
i
happened
to
glance
toward
the
reflection
of
the
bed
which
showed
plainly
in
the
mirror
and
i
distinctly
saw
a
dark
eye
peeping
through
an
opening
in
the
curtains
my
heart
was
in
my
throat
i
assure
you
but
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
cry
out
or
to
jump
up
i
continued
combing
my
hair
occasionally
glancing
toward
the
eye
if
it
be
one
of
the
negroes
thought
i
he
surely
can
not
wish
to
injure
for
they
all
know
i
am
friendly
to
them
i
tried
to
collect
all
my
faculties
to
determine
what
it
was
best
to
do
i
reflected
that
if
i
alarmed
the
servants
he
might
be
driven
to
attack
me
in
i
began
talking
aloud
to
myself
leisurely
taking
off
my
cuffs
and
collar
as
i
did
so
and
laying
my
breastpin
and
watch
upon
the
table
wish
and
fitzgerald
were
not
going
to
stay
so
long
at
beaufort
said
i
is
lonesome
here
and
i
do
feel
at
home
in
this
chamber
i
sleep
if
i
go
to
bed
so
i
think
i
read
a
little
longer
looked
round
on
the
table
and
chairs
and
added
now
i
left
my
book
down
stairs
and
must
go
for
it
i
went
down
to
the
parlor
and
locked
myself
in
a
few
minutes
afterward
i
saw
a
dark
figure
steal
across
the
piazza
and
unless
the
moonlight
deceived
me
it
was
dandy
jim
i
wondered
at
it
because
i
thought
he
was
on
his
way
to
new
orleans
of
course
there
was
no
sleep
for
me
that
night
when
the
household
were
all
astir
i
went
to
the
chamber
again
my
watch
and
breastpin
which
i
had
left
on
purpose
were
still
lying
on
the
table
it
was
evident
that
robbery
had
not
been
the
object
i
did
not
mention
the
adventure
to
any
one
i
pitied
jim
and
if
he
had
escaped
i
had
no
mind
to
be
the
means
of
his
recapture
whatever
harm
he
had
intended
he
had
not
done
it
and
there
was
no
probability
that
he
would
loiter
about
in
that
vicinity
i
had
reason
to
be
glad
of
my
silence
for
the
next
day
an
agent
from
the
arrived
saying
that
jim
had
escaped
and
that
they
thought
he
might
be
lurking
near
where
his
wife
was
when
and
fitzgerald
returned
they
questioned
nelly
but
she
averred
that
she
had
not
seen
jim
or
heard
from
him
since
he
was
sold
fitzgerald
went
away
on
horseback
that
afternoon
the
horse
came
back
in
the
evening
with
an
empty
saddle
and
he
never
returned
the
next
morning
nelly
was
missing
and
she
was
never
found
i
thought
it
right
to
be
silent
about
my
adventure
to
have
done
otherwise
might
have
produced
mischievous
results
to
jim
and
nelly
and
could
do
their
master
no
good
i
searched
the
woods
in
every
direction
but
i
never
came
upon
any
trace
of
fitzgerald
except
the
marks
of
footsteps
near
the
sea
before
the
rising
of
the
tide
i
had
made
arrangements
to
return
to
the
north
about
that
time
but
fitzgerald
second
son
was
seized
with
fever
and
i
stayed
with
her
till
he
was
dead
and
buried
then
we
all
came
to
boston
together
about
a
year
after
her
little
daughter
who
had
been
my
pupil
died
poor
mrs
fitzgerald
said
flora
i
have
heard
her
allude
to
her
lost
children
but
i
had
no
idea
she
had
suffered
so
much
she
did
suffer
replied
mrs
bright
though
not
so
deeply
as
some
natures
would
have
suffered
in
the
same
circumstances
her
present
situation
is
far
from
being
enviable
her
father
is
a
hard
grasping
man
and
he
was
greatly
vexed
that
her
splendid
marriage
turned
out
to
be
such
a
failure
it
must
be
very
mortifying
to
her
to
depend
upon
him
mainly
for
the
support
of
herself
and
son
i
pitied
her
and
i
pitied
fitzgerald
too
he
was
selfish
and
dissipated
because
he
was
brought
up
with
plenty
of
money
and
slaves
to
obey
everything
he
chose
to
order
that
is
enough
to
spoil
any
man
rosa
had
listened
with
downcast
eyes
but
now
she
looked
up
earnestly
and
said
that
is
a
very
kind
judgment
mrs
bright
and
i
thank
you
for
the
lesson
it
is
a
just
judgment
replied
their
sensible
hostess
i
often
tell
mr
bright
we
can
not
be
too
thankful
that
we
were
brought
up
to
wait
upon
ourselves
and
earn
our
own
living
you
will
please
to
excuse
me
now
ladies
for
it
is
time
to
prepare
tea
as
she
closed
the
door
rosa
pressed
her
sister
hand
and
sighed
as
she
said
o
this
is
dreadful
dreadful
indeed
rejoined
flora
to
think
of
him
as
he
was
when
i
used
to
make
you
blush
by
singing
blanc
mon
bon
and
then
to
think
what
an
end
he
came
to
the
sisters
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
thinking
with
moistened
eyes
of
all
that
had
been
kind
and
pleasant
in
the
man
who
had
done
them
so
much
wrong
chapter
xxx
if
young
fitzgerald
had
not
been
strongly
inclined
to
spend
the
summer
in
northampton
he
would
have
been
urged
to
it
by
his
mother
and
grandfather
who
were
disposed
to
make
any
effort
to
place
him
in
the
vicinity
of
eulalia
king
they
took
possession
of
lodgings
on
round
hill
in
june
and
though
very
few
weeks
intervened
before
the
college
vacation
the
time
seemed
so
long
to
gerald
that
he
impatiently
counted
the
days
twice
he
took
the
journey
for
a
short
visit
before
he
was
established
as
an
inmate
of
his
household
alfred
blumenthal
had
a
vacation
at
the
same
time
and
the
young
people
of
the
three
families
were
together
almost
continually
songs
and
glees
enlivened
their
evenings
and
nearly
every
day
there
were
boating
excursions
or
rides
on
horseback
in
which
and
king
and
and
blumenthal
invariably
joined
no
familiarity
could
stale
the
ever
fresh
charm
of
the
scenery
the
beautiful
river
softly
flowing
in
sunlight
through
richly
cultivated
meadows
always
seemed
to
blumenthal
like
the
visible
music
of
mendelssohn
king
who
had
been
in
germany
was
strongly
reminded
of
the
rhine
and
the
black
forest
while
looking
on
that
wide
level
expanse
of
verdure
with
its
broad
band
of
sparkling
silver
framed
in
with
thick
dark
woods
along
the
of
mountains
the
younger
persons
of
the
party
more
especially
enjoyed
watching
mill
river
rushing
to
meet
the
connecticut
like
an
impatient
boy
let
loose
for
the
holidays
shouting
and
laughing
and
leaping
on
his
way
homeward
delano
particularly
liked
to
see
from
the
summit
of
mount
holyoke
the
handsome
villages
lying
so
still
in
the
distance
giving
no
sign
of
all
the
passions
energies
and
sorrows
that
were
seething
struggling
and
aching
there
and
the
great
stretch
of
meadows
diversified
with
long
unfenced
rows
of
stately
indian
corn
rich
with
luxuriant
foliage
of
glossy
green
alternating
with
broad
bands
of
yellow
grain
swayed
by
the
breeze
like
rippling
waves
of
the
sea
these
regular
lines
of
variegated
culture
seen
from
such
a
height
seemed
like
handsome
striped
calico
which
earth
had
put
on
for
her
mindful
that
the
richly
wooded
hills
were
looking
down
upon
her
picturesque
attire
there
was
something
peculiarly
congenial
to
the
thoughtful
soul
of
the
cultured
lady
in
the
quiet
pastoral
beauty
of
the
extensive
scene
and
still
more
in
the
sense
of
serene
elevation
above
the
whole
seeing
it
all
dwindle
into
small
proportions
as
the
wisdom
of
age
calmly
surveys
the
remote
panorama
of
life
these
riding
parties
attracted
great
attention
as
they
passed
through
the
streets
for
all
had
heard
the
rumor
of
their
wealth
and
all
were
struck
by
the
unusual
amount
of
personal
beauty
and
the
distinguished
style
of
dress
at
that
time
the
empress
eugenie
had
issued
her
imperial
decree
that
all
the
world
should
shine
in
barbaric
gold
a
fashion
by
no
means
distasteful
to
the
sisters
long
sprays
of
scotch
laburnum
mingled
their
golden
bells
with
the
dark
tresses
of
eulalia
and
rosen
blumen
a
cluster
of
golden
wheat
mixed
its
shining
threads
with
flora
black
curls
and
a
long
soft
feather
like
the
raven
down
of
darkness
dusted
with
gold
drooped
over
the
edge
of
king
fastened
to
its
band
by
a
golden
star
even
fitzgerald
so
far
changed
her
livery
of
the
moon
as
to
wear
golden
buds
mixed
with
cerulean
flowers
delano
looked
cool
as
evening
among
them
in
her
small
gray
bonnet
with
a
few
violets
half
hidden
in
silver
leaves
old
bell
not
unfrequently
joined
in
these
excursions
his
white
hair
and
long
silky
white
beard
formed
a
picturesque
variety
in
the
group
while
all
recognized
at
a
glance
the
thoroughbred
aristocrat
in
his
haughty
bearing
his
stern
mouth
his
cold
turquoise
eyes
and
the
clenching
expression
of
his
hand
king
seemed
to
have
produced
upon
him
the
effect
gerald
had
predicted
no
youthful
gallant
could
have
been
more
assiduous
at
her
and
he
seemed
to
envy
his
grandson
every
smile
he
obtained
from
her
beautiful
lips
both
he
and
fitzgerald
viewed
with
obvious
satisfaction
the
growing
intimacy
between
that
young
gentleman
and
eulalia
capital
match
for
gerald
eh
said
bell
to
his
daughter
they
say
good
for
three
millions
at
least
some
say
four
and
eulalia
is
such
a
lovely
gentle
girl
rejoined
fitzgerald
i
very
fond
of
her
and
she
seems
fond
of
me
though
of
course
that
on
account
of
my
handsome
son
yes
she
a
lovely
girl
replied
the
old
gentleman
and
gerald
will
be
a
lucky
dog
if
he
wins
her
but
her
beauty
is
to
be
compared
to
her
mother
if
i
were
emperor
of
france
and
she
were
a
widow
i
know
who
would
have
a
chance
to
become
empress
but
though
king
lived
in
such
an
atmosphere
of
love
and
was
the
object
of
so
much
admiration
with
ample
means
for
indulging
her
benevolence
and
her
tastes
she
was
evidently
far
from
being
happy
flora
observed
it
and
often
queried
with
her
husband
what
could
be
the
reason
one
day
she
spoke
to
king
of
the
entire
absence
of
gayety
in
her
sister
and
he
said
he
feared
young
fitzgerald
painfully
reminded
her
of
her
lost
son
flora
reflected
upon
this
answer
without
being
satisfied
with
it
it
does
seem
natural
said
she
to
her
husband
she
parted
from
that
baby
when
he
was
but
a
few
weeks
old
and
he
has
been
dead
nearly
twenty
years
she
has
eulalia
to
love
and
a
noble
husband
who
worships
the
very
ground
she
treads
on
it
do
seem
natural
i
wonder
whether
she
has
a
cancer
or
some
other
secret
disease
she
redoubled
her
tenderness
and
exerted
all
her
powers
of
mimicry
to
amuse
her
sister
the
young
folks
screamed
with
laughter
to
see
her
perform
the
shuffling
dances
of
the
negroes
or
to
hear
her
accompany
their
singing
with
imitations
of
the
growling
or
the
squeaking
fife
in
vain
she
filled
the
room
with
or
showed
off
the
accomplishments
of
the
parrot
or
dressed
herself
in
a
cap
with
a
great
shaking
bow
like
madame
guirlande
or
scolded
in
vociferous
italian
like
signor
pimentero
the
utmost
these
efforts
could
elicit
from
her
sister
was
a
faint
vanishing
smile
king
noticed
all
this
and
was
pained
to
observe
that
his
sadness
increased
daily
he
would
not
himself
have
chosen
young
fitzgerald
as
a
suitor
for
his
daughter
fearing
he
might
resemble
his
father
in
character
as
he
did
in
person
but
he
was
willing
to
promote
their
acquaintance
because
the
young
man
seemed
to
be
a
favorite
with
his
lady
and
he
thought
that
as
a
he
might
supply
the
loss
of
her
but
in
their
rides
and
other
excursions
he
was
surprised
to
observe
that
king
assiduously
tried
to
withdraw
fitzgerald
from
her
daughter
and
attach
him
to
herself
her
attentions
generally
proved
too
flattering
to
be
resisted
but
if
the
young
man
yielding
to
attractions
more
suited
to
his
age
soon
returned
to
eulalia
there
was
an
unmistakable
expression
of
pain
on
her
mother
face
king
was
puzzled
and
pained
by
this
conduct
entire
confidence
had
hitherto
existed
between
them
why
had
she
become
so
reserved
was
the
fire
of
still
smouldering
in
her
soul
and
did
a
delicate
consideration
for
him
lead
her
to
conceal
it
he
could
not
believe
it
she
had
so
often
repeated
that
to
love
the
unworthy
was
a
thing
impossible
for
her
sometimes
another
thought
crossed
his
mind
and
gave
him
exquisite
torture
though
he
repelled
it
instantly
could
it
possibly
be
that
his
modest
and
dignified
wife
was
in
love
with
this
stripling
who
was
of
an
age
suitable
for
her
daughter
whatever
this
mysterious
cloud
might
be
that
cast
its
cold
shadow
across
the
sunshine
of
his
home
he
felt
that
he
could
not
endure
its
presence
he
resolved
to
seek
an
explanation
with
his
wife
and
to
propose
an
immediate
return
to
europe
if
either
of
his
conjectures
should
prove
true
returning
from
a
solitary
walk
during
which
these
ideas
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
he
found
her
in
their
chamber
kneeling
by
the
bedside
sobbing
violently
with
the
utmost
tenderness
he
inquired
what
had
grieved
her
she
answered
with
a
wild
exclamation
o
alfred
this
be
stopped
must
be
stopped
my
dear
said
he
gerald
fitzgerald
not
court
our
daughter
she
replied
i
thought
it
would
please
you
dearest
rejoined
he
the
young
man
has
always
seemed
to
be
a
favorite
of
yours
i
should
not
have
selected
him
for
our
eulalia
for
fear
the
qualities
of
his
father
might
develop
themselves
in
him
but
you
must
remember
that
he
has
not
been
educated
among
slaves
i
think
we
can
trust
to
that
to
make
a
great
difference
in
his
character
she
groaned
aloud
and
sobbed
out
it
be
stopped
it
will
kill
me
he
sat
down
by
her
side
took
her
hand
and
said
very
gravely
rosa
you
have
often
told
me
i
was
your
best
friend
why
then
do
you
not
confide
to
me
what
it
is
that
troubles
you
o
i
can
not
i
can
not
she
exclaimed
i
am
a
guilty
wretch
and
there
came
a
fresh
outburst
of
sobs
which
she
stifled
by
keeping
her
face
hidden
in
the
bedclothes
rosa
said
he
still
more
gravely
you
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
strange
conduct
if
an
unworthy
passion
has
taken
possession
of
you
it
is
your
duty
to
try
to
conquer
it
for
your
own
sake
for
my
sake
for
our
daughter
sake
if
you
will
confide
in
me
i
will
not
judge
you
harshly
i
will
return
to
europe
with
you
and
help
you
to
cure
yourself
tell
me
frankly
rosa
do
you
love
this
young
man
she
looked
up
suddenly
and
seeing
the
extreme
sadness
of
his
face
she
exclaimed
o
alfred
if
you
have
thought
i
tell
you
all
i
do
love
gerald
but
it
is
because
he
is
my
own
son
your
son
he
exclaimed
springing
up
with
the
feeling
that
a
great
load
was
lifted
from
his
heart
he
raised
her
to
his
bosom
and
kissed
her
tearful
face
again
and
again
the
relief
was
so
sudden
that
for
an
instant
he
forgot
the
strangeness
of
her
declaration
but
coming
to
his
senses
immediately
he
inquired
how
can
it
be
that
your
son
passes
for
fitzgerald
son
and
if
it
be
so
why
did
you
not
tell
me
of
it
i
ought
to
have
told
you
when
i
consented
to
marry
you
she
replied
but
your
protecting
love
was
so
precious
to
me
that
i
had
not
the
courage
to
tell
you
anything
that
would
diminish
your
esteem
for
me
forgive
me
dearest
it
is
the
only
wrong
i
have
ever
done
you
but
i
will
tell
you
all
now
and
if
it
changes
your
love
for
me
i
must
try
to
bear
it
as
a
just
punishment
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
you
know
how
fitzgerald
deserted
me
and
how
i
was
stricken
down
when
i
discovered
that
i
was
his
slave
my
soul
almost
parted
from
my
body
during
the
long
illness
that
followed
when
i
came
to
my
senses
i
humbled
myself
to
entreat
fitzgerald
to
emancipate
me
for
the
sake
of
our
unborn
child
he
promised
to
do
it
but
he
did
not
i
was
a
mere
wreck
when
my
babe
was
born
and
i
had
the
feeling
that
i
should
soon
die
i
loved
the
helpless
little
thing
and
every
time
i
looked
at
him
it
gave
me
a
pang
to
think
that
he
was
born
a
slave
i
sent
again
and
again
for
papers
of
manumission
but
they
never
came
i
do
know
whether
it
was
mere
negligence
on
the
part
of
fitzgerald
or
whether
he
meant
to
punish
me
for
my
coldness
toward
him
after
i
discovered
how
he
had
deceived
me
i
was
weak
in
body
and
much
humbled
in
spirit
after
that
long
illness
i
felt
no
resentment
toward
him
i
forgave
him
and
pitied
his
young
wife
the
only
thing
that
bound
me
to
life
was
my
child
i
wanted
to
recover
my
strength
that
i
might
carry
him
to
some
part
of
the
world
where
slavery
could
not
reach
him
i
was
in
that
state
when
madame
sent
duroy
to
tell
me
fitzgerald
was
in
debt
and
had
sold
me
to
that
odious
bruteman
whom
he
had
always
represented
to
me
as
the
filthiest
soul
alive
i
think
that
incredible
cruelty
and
that
horrible
danger
made
me
insane
my
soul
was
in
a
terrible
tempest
of
hatred
and
revenge
if
fitzgerald
had
appeared
before
me
i
should
have
stabbed
him
i
never
had
such
feelings
before
nor
since
unfortunately
chloe
had
come
to
the
cottage
that
day
with
fitzgerald
babe
and
he
was
lying
asleep
by
the
side
of
mine
i
had
wild
thoughts
of
killing
both
the
babies
and
then
killing
myself
i
had
actually
risen
in
search
of
a
weapon
but
i
heard
my
faithful
tulee
coming
to
look
upon
me
to
see
that
all
was
well
and
i
lay
down
again
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
while
i
waited
for
her
to
cease
watching
over
me
that
frightful
mood
passed
away
thank
god
i
was
saved
from
committing
such
horrible
deeds
but
i
was
still
half
frantic
with
misery
and
fear
a
wild
dark
storm
was
raging
in
my
soul
i
looked
at
the
two
babes
and
thought
how
one
was
born
to
be
indulged
and
honored
while
the
other
was
born
a
slave
liable
to
be
sold
by
his
unfeeling
father
or
by
his
creditors
mine
was
only
a
week
the
oldest
and
was
no
larger
than
his
brother
they
were
so
exactly
alike
that
i
could
distinguish
them
only
by
their
dress
i
exchanged
the
dresses
alfred
and
while
i
did
it
i
laughed
to
think
that
if
fitzgerald
should
capture
me
and
the
little
one
and
make
us
over
to
bruteman
he
would
sell
the
child
of
his
lily
bell
it
was
not
like
me
to
have
such
feelings
i
hope
i
was
insane
do
you
think
i
was
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
as
he
replied
you
surely
had
suffering
enough
to
drive
you
wild
dearest
and
i
do
suppose
your
reason
was
unsettled
by
intensity
of
anguish
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
as
she
asked
then
it
does
not
make
you
love
me
less
no
darling
he
replied
for
i
am
sure
it
was
not
my
own
gentle
rosa
who
had
such
feelings
o
how
i
thank
you
dear
one
for
judging
me
so
charitably
said
she
i
hope
it
was
temporary
insanity
and
always
when
i
think
it
over
it
seems
to
me
it
must
have
been
i
fell
asleep
smiling
over
the
revenge
i
had
taken
and
i
slept
long
and
heavily
when
i
woke
my
first
wish
was
to
change
the
dresses
back
again
but
chloe
had
gone
to
the
plantation
with
my
babe
and
duroy
hurried
me
on
board
the
boat
before
sunrise
i
told
no
one
what
i
had
done
but
it
filled
me
with
remorse
then
and
has
troubled
me
ever
since
i
resolved
to
atone
for
it
as
far
as
i
could
by
taking
the
tenderest
care
of
the
little
changeling
and
trying
to
educate
him
as
well
as
his
own
mother
could
have
done
it
was
that
which
gave
me
strength
to
work
so
hard
for
musical
distinction
and
that
motive
stimulated
me
to
appear
as
an
though
the
publicity
was
distasteful
to
me
when
i
heard
that
the
poor
little
creature
was
dead
i
was
tormented
with
and
i
was
all
the
more
unhappy
because
i
could
tell
no
one
of
my
trouble
then
you
came
to
console
and
strengthen
me
with
your
blessed
love
and
i
grew
cheerful
again
if
the
changeling
had
been
living
at
the
time
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
i
should
have
told
you
all
but
the
poor
little
creature
was
dead
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
necessity
of
confessing
the
wrong
i
had
done
it
was
a
selfish
feeling
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
diminishing
the
love
that
was
so
precious
to
my
wounded
heart
i
have
now
told
you
all
dear
husband
your
excuse
for
concealment
is
very
precious
to
my
own
heart
he
replied
but
i
regret
you
did
not
tell
me
while
we
were
in
europe
for
then
i
would
not
have
returned
to
the
united
states
till
i
was
quite
sure
all
obstacles
were
removed
you
know
i
never
formed
the
project
until
i
knew
fitzgerald
was
dead
the
american
gentleman
who
informed
you
of
his
death
led
me
into
a
mistake
which
has
proved
disastrous
rejoined
she
he
said
that
fitzgerald
lost
her
husband
and
son
about
the
same
time
i
was
not
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
second
son
and
therefore
i
supposed
that
my
had
died
i
knew
that
you
wanted
to
spend
your
old
age
in
your
native
country
and
that
you
were
particularly
desirous
to
have
eulalia
marry
in
new
england
the
dread
i
had
of
meeting
my
child
as
the
son
of
another
and
seeming
to
him
a
stranger
was
removed
by
his
death
and
though
i
shed
tears
in
secret
a
load
was
lifted
from
my
heart
but
the
old
story
of
avenging
furies
following
the
criminal
wheresoever
he
goes
seems
verified
in
my
case
on
the
day
of
green
ball
i
heard
two
gentlemen
in
the
revere
house
talking
about
bell
and
one
of
them
said
to
the
other
that
second
son
and
her
daughter
had
died
and
that
her
oldest
son
was
sole
heir
to
bell
property
my
first
impulse
was
to
tell
you
all
but
because
i
had
so
long
concealed
my
fault
it
was
all
the
more
difficult
to
confess
it
then
you
had
so
generously
overlooked
many
disagreeable
circumstances
connected
with
my
history
that
i
found
it
extremely
painful
to
add
this
miserable
entanglement
to
the
list
still
i
foresaw
that
it
must
be
done
and
i
resolved
to
do
it
but
i
was
cowardly
and
wanted
to
put
off
the
evil
day
you
may
remember
perhaps
that
at
the
last
moment
i
objected
to
attending
that
ball
but
you
thought
it
would
be
rude
to
disappoint
green
merely
because
i
felt
out
of
spirits
i
went
not
dreaming
of
seeing
my
son
there
i
had
not
looked
upon
him
since
the
little
black
silky
head
drooped
on
my
arm
while
i
exchanged
the
dresses
you
may
partly
imagine
what
i
suffered
and
now
he
and
eulalia
are
getting
in
love
with
each
other
and
i
know
not
what
is
to
be
done
when
you
came
in
i
was
praying
for
strength
to
seek
your
counsel
what
we
do
dear
it
will
be
a
great
disappointment
for
you
to
return
to
europe
now
that
you
have
refitted
your
father
house
and
made
all
your
arrangements
to
spend
the
remainder
of
our
days
here
i
would
do
it
willingly
he
replied
if
i
thought
it
would
avail
to
separate
gerald
and
eulalia
but
a
voyage
to
europe
is
nothing
to
people
of
their
property
i
believe
he
loves
the
dear
girl
and
if
he
did
not
my
reputed
millions
would
prevent
his
grandfather
and
his
mother
from
allowing
him
to
lose
sight
of
her
if
we
were
to
build
a
castle
on
the
top
of
mount
himalaya
they
would
scale
it
you
may
depend
i
see
no
other
remedy
than
to
tell
gerald
that
eulalia
is
his
sister
o
i
can
not
tell
him
exclaimed
she
it
would
be
so
dreadful
to
have
my
son
hate
me
and
he
hate
me
for
i
can
see
that
he
is
very
proud
in
very
kind
and
serious
tones
he
replied
you
know
dear
rosa
that
you
expressed
a
wish
the
other
day
to
go
to
the
catholic
church
in
which
your
mother
worshipped
because
you
thought
confession
and
penance
would
be
a
comfort
you
have
wisely
chosen
me
for
your
confessor
and
if
i
recommend
penance
i
trust
you
will
think
it
best
to
follow
my
advice
i
see
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
tell
all
your
own
and
your
mother
story
to
so
young
a
man
as
gerald
and
he
your
own
son
i
will
tell
him
and
i
need
not
assure
you
that
you
will
have
a
loving
advocate
to
plead
your
cause
with
him
but
his
mother
must
know
why
he
relinquishes
eulalia
when
he
has
had
so
much
reason
to
think
himself
in
favor
both
with
her
and
her
parents
gerald
might
tell
her
the
mere
external
facts
but
she
could
appreciate
and
understand
them
much
better
if
told
as
they
would
be
told
by
a
delicate
and
loving
woman
who
had
suffered
the
wrongs
that
drove
her
to
madness
and
who
repented
bitterly
of
the
fault
she
had
committed
i
think
you
ought
to
make
a
full
confession
to
fitzgerald
and
having
done
that
we
ought
to
do
whatever
she
chooses
to
prescribe
it
will
be
a
severe
penance
she
rejoined
but
i
will
do
whatever
you
think
is
right
if
i
could
have
all
the
suffering
i
would
not
murmur
but
gerald
will
suffer
and
eulalia
will
suffer
and
for
some
weeks
i
have
made
you
unhappy
how
sad
you
look
dear
i
am
a
very
happy
man
rosa
compared
with
what
i
was
before
you
told
me
this
strange
story
but
i
am
very
serious
because
i
want
to
be
sure
of
doing
what
is
right
in
these
difficult
premises
as
for
gerald
and
eulalia
their
acquaintance
has
been
very
short
and
i
do
think
they
have
spoken
of
love
to
each
other
their
extreme
youth
is
also
a
favorable
circumstance
rochefoucault
says
extinguishes
small
passions
and
increases
great
ones
my
own
experience
proved
the
truth
of
one
part
of
the
maxim
but
perhaps
gerald
is
of
a
more
volatile
temperament
and
will
realize
the
other
portion
and
do
you
still
love
me
as
well
as
you
ever
did
she
asked
he
folded
her
more
closely
as
he
whispered
i
do
darling
and
for
some
minutes
she
wept
in
silence
on
his
generous
breast
chapter
xxxi
that
evening
young
fitzgerald
was
closeted
two
or
three
hours
with
king
though
the
disclosure
was
made
with
the
utmost
delicacy
and
caution
the
young
man
was
startled
and
shocked
for
he
inherited
pride
from
both
his
parents
and
he
had
been
educated
in
the
prejudices
of
his
grandfather
at
first
he
flushed
with
indignation
and
refused
to
believe
he
was
so
disgraced
i
do
see
that
you
are
disgraced
my
young
friend
replied
king
the
world
might
indeed
so
misjudge
because
it
is
accustomed
to
look
only
on
externals
but
there
is
no
need
that
the
world
should
know
anything
about
it
and
as
for
your
own
estimate
of
yourself
you
were
fitzgerald
the
gentleman
before
you
knew
this
singular
story
and
you
are
fitzgerald
the
gentleman
still
i
am
not
so
much
of
a
philosopher
rejoined
the
young
man
i
shall
not
find
it
easy
to
endure
the
double
stain
of
illegitimacy
and
alliance
with
the
colored
race
king
regarded
him
with
a
friendly
smile
as
he
answered
perhaps
this
experience
which
you
find
so
disagreeable
may
educate
you
to
more
wisdom
than
the
schools
have
done
it
may
teach
you
the
great
lesson
of
looking
beneath
the
surface
into
the
reality
of
things
my
son
legally
you
are
illegitimate
but
morally
you
are
not
so
your
mother
believed
herself
married
to
your
father
and
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
her
life
she
has
proved
herself
a
modest
pure
and
noble
woman
during
twenty
years
of
intimate
acquaintance
i
have
never
known
her
to
indulge
an
unworthy
thought
or
do
a
dishonorable
action
except
that
of
substituting
you
for
fitzgerald
legal
heir
and
if
i
have
at
all
succeeded
in
impressing
upon
your
mind
the
frantic
agony
of
her
soul
desolate
and
shockingly
abused
as
she
was
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
in
considering
that
an
excusable
offence
especially
as
she
would
have
repaired
the
wrong
a
few
hours
later
if
it
had
been
in
her
power
with
regard
to
an
alliance
with
the
colored
race
i
think
it
would
be
a
more
legitimate
source
of
pride
to
have
descended
from
that
truly
great
man
toussaint
who
was
a
african
than
from
that
unprincipled
filibuster
called
william
the
conqueror
or
from
any
of
his
band
of
robbers
who
transmitted
titles
of
nobility
to
their
posterity
that
is
the
way
i
have
learned
to
read
history
my
young
friend
in
the
plain
sunlight
of
truth
unchanged
by
looking
at
it
through
the
deceptive
colored
glasses
of
conventional
prejudice
only
yesterday
you
would
have
felt
honored
to
claim
my
highly
accomplished
and
wife
as
a
near
relative
she
is
as
highly
accomplished
and
a
lady
as
she
was
yesterday
the
only
difference
is
that
you
are
aware
her
grandmother
had
a
dark
complexion
no
human
being
can
be
really
stained
by
anything
apart
from
his
own
character
but
if
there
were
any
blot
resting
upon
you
it
would
come
from
your
father
we
should
remember
however
that
he
who
made
man
can
alone
justly
estimate
man
temptations
for
myself
i
believe
that
fitzgerald
sins
were
largely
attributable
to
the
system
of
slavery
under
which
he
had
the
misfortune
to
be
educated
he
loved
pleasure
he
was
rich
and
he
had
irresponsible
power
over
many
of
his
whom
law
and
public
opinion
alike
deprived
of
protection
without
judging
him
harshly
let
his
career
be
a
warning
to
you
to
resist
the
first
enticements
to
evil
and
as
one
means
of
doing
so
let
me
advise
you
never
to
place
yourself
in
that
state
of
society
which
had
such
a
malign
influence
upon
him
give
me
time
to
think
rejoined
the
young
man
this
has
come
upon
me
so
suddenly
that
i
feel
stunned
that
i
can
easily
imagine
replied
his
friend
but
i
wish
you
to
understand
distinctly
that
it
depends
entirely
upon
fitzgerald
and
yourself
to
decide
what
is
to
be
done
in
relation
to
this
perplexing
affair
we
are
ready
to
do
anything
you
wish
or
to
take
any
position
you
prescribe
for
us
you
may
prefer
to
pass
in
society
merely
as
my
young
friend
but
you
are
my
you
know
and
should
you
at
any
time
of
your
life
need
my
services
you
may
rely
upon
me
as
an
affectionate
father
that
word
brought
cherished
hopes
to
gerald
mind
and
he
sighed
as
he
answered
i
thank
you
whatever
outward
inconveniences
may
arise
from
this
state
of
things
resumed
king
we
prefer
to
have
them
fall
upon
ourselves
it
is
of
course
desirable
that
you
and
my
daughter
should
not
meet
at
present
your
vacation
has
nearly
expired
and
perhaps
you
will
deem
it
prudent
to
return
a
little
sooner
than
you
intended
we
shall
remain
here
till
late
in
the
autumn
and
then
if
circumstances
render
it
necessary
we
will
remove
eulalia
to
cuba
or
elsewhere
for
the
winter
try
to
bear
this
disappointment
bravely
my
son
as
soon
as
you
feel
sufficiently
calm
i
would
advise
you
to
seek
an
interview
with
your
mother
her
heart
yearns
for
you
and
the
longer
your
meeting
is
deferred
the
more
embarrassing
it
will
be
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
in
the
parlor
the
two
mothers
of
the
young
man
were
talking
confidentially
up
stairs
the
intense
curiosity
which
fitzgerald
had
formerly
felt
was
at
once
renewed
when
king
said
do
you
remember
having
heard
any
one
singing
about
the
house
and
garden
at
magnolia
lawn
the
first
evening
you
spent
there
indeed
i
do
she
replied
and
when
i
first
heard
you
in
rome
i
repeatedly
said
your
voice
was
precisely
like
that
singer
you
might
well
be
reminded
of
it
responded
king
for
i
was
the
person
you
heard
at
magnolia
lawn
and
these
are
the
eyes
that
peeped
at
you
through
the
lattice
of
the
veranda
but
why
were
you
there
and
why
did
you
keep
yourself
invisible
inquired
fitzgerald
rosa
hesitated
a
moment
embarrassed
how
to
choose
words
to
convey
the
unwelcome
facts
my
dear
lady
said
she
we
have
both
had
very
sad
experiences
on
my
side
they
have
been
healed
by
time
and
i
trust
it
is
the
same
with
you
will
it
pain
you
too
much
to
hear
something
disparaging
to
the
memory
of
your
deceased
husband
fitzgerald
colored
very
deeply
and
remained
silent
nothing
but
an
imperious
necessity
would
induce
me
to
say
what
i
am
about
to
say
continued
king
not
only
because
i
am
very
reluctant
to
wound
your
feelings
but
because
the
recital
is
humiliating
and
painful
to
myself
when
i
peeped
at
you
in
your
bridal
attire
i
believed
myself
to
be
fitzgerald
wife
our
marriage
had
been
kept
strictly
private
he
always
assuring
me
that
it
was
only
for
a
time
but
you
need
not
look
so
alarmed
i
was
not
his
wife
i
learned
the
next
morning
that
i
had
been
deceived
by
a
sham
ceremony
and
even
if
it
had
been
genuine
the
marriage
would
not
have
been
valid
by
the
laws
of
louisiana
where
it
was
performed
though
i
did
not
know
that
fact
at
the
time
no
marriage
with
a
slave
is
valid
in
that
state
my
mother
was
a
quadroon
slave
and
by
the
law
that
child
follows
the
condition
of
the
mother
i
also
became
a
slave
a
slave
exclaimed
fitzgerald
with
unfeigned
astonishment
that
is
incredible
that
goes
beyond
any
of
the
stories
abolitionists
make
up
to
keep
the
country
in
agitation
judging
by
my
own
experience
rejoined
king
i
should
say
that
the
most
fertile
imagination
could
invent
nothing
more
strange
and
romantic
than
many
of
the
incidents
which
grow
out
of
slavery
she
then
went
on
to
repeat
her
story
in
detail
not
accusing
fitzgerald
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
to
explain
the
agonized
and
frantic
state
of
mind
in
which
she
had
changed
the
children
fitzgerald
listened
with
increasing
agitation
as
she
went
on
and
when
it
came
to
that
avowal
she
burst
out
with
the
passionate
exclamation
then
gerald
is
not
my
son
and
i
love
him
so
king
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
gently
as
she
said
you
can
love
him
still
dear
lady
and
he
will
love
you
doubtless
you
will
always
seem
to
him
like
his
own
mother
if
he
takes
an
aversion
to
me
it
will
give
me
acute
pain
but
i
shall
try
to
bear
it
meekly
as
a
part
of
the
punishment
my
fault
deserves
if
you
do
intend
to
take
him
from
me
what
was
the
use
of
telling
me
this
dreadful
story
impatiently
asked
fitzgerald
i
felt
compelled
to
do
it
on
eulalia
account
responded
king
ah
yes
sighed
the
lady
how
disappointed
he
will
be
poor
fellow
after
a
brief
pause
she
added
vehemently
but
whatever
you
may
say
he
is
son
i
never
will
give
him
up
he
has
slept
in
my
arms
i
have
sung
him
to
sleep
i
taught
him
all
his
little
hymns
and
songs
he
loves
me
and
i
will
never
consent
to
take
a
second
place
in
his
affections
you
shall
not
be
asked
to
do
so
dear
lady
meekly
replied
king
i
will
as
in
duty
bound
take
any
place
you
choose
to
assign
me
somewhat
disarmed
by
this
humility
fitzgerald
said
in
a
softened
tone
i
pity
you
king
you
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
this
is
a
very
trying
situation
you
are
in
but
it
would
break
my
heart
to
give
up
gerald
and
then
you
must
see
of
course
what
an
embarrassing
position
it
would
place
me
in
before
the
world
i
see
no
reason
why
the
world
should
know
anything
about
it
rejoined
king
for
gerald
sake
as
well
as
our
own
it
is
very
desirable
that
the
secret
should
be
kept
between
ourselves
you
may
safely
trust
my
pride
for
that
she
replied
do
you
think
your
father
ought
to
be
included
in
our
confidence
inquired
king
no
indeed
she
replied
hastily
he
never
can
bear
to
hear
my
poor
husband
mentioned
besides
he
has
had
the
gout
a
good
deal
lately
and
is
more
irritable
than
usual
as
she
rose
to
go
king
said
then
with
the
exception
of
eulalia
everything
remains
outwardly
as
it
was
can
you
forgive
me
i
do
believe
i
was
insane
with
misery
and
you
do
know
how
i
have
been
haunted
with
remorse
you
must
have
suffered
terribly
rejoined
fitzgerald
evading
a
direct
answer
to
the
question
but
we
had
better
not
talk
any
more
about
it
now
i
am
bewildered
and
do
know
what
to
think
only
one
thing
is
fixed
in
my
mind
gerald
is
son
they
parted
politely
but
with
coldness
on
fitzgerald
side
there
had
arisen
in
her
mind
a
double
dislike
toward
king
as
the
first
love
of
her
husband
and
as
the
mother
of
the
elegant
young
man
who
was
to
her
an
object
of
pride
as
well
as
fondness
but
her
chagrin
was
not
without
compensation
king
superior
wealth
and
beauty
had
been
felt
by
her
as
somewhat
overshadowing
and
the
mortifying
circumstances
she
had
now
discovered
in
her
history
seemed
in
her
imagination
to
bring
her
down
below
a
level
with
herself
she
and
gerald
sat
up
late
into
the
night
talking
over
this
strange
disclosure
she
was
rather
jealous
of
the
compassion
he
expressed
for
king
and
of
his
admiration
for
her
manners
and
character
though
they
mutually
declared
again
and
again
that
they
could
realize
no
change
whatever
in
their
relation
to
each
other
the
wise
words
of
king
had
not
been
without
their
effect
on
gerald
the
tumult
of
emotions
gradually
subsided
and
he
began
to
realize
that
these
external
accidents
made
no
essential
change
in
himself
the
next
morning
he
requested
an
interview
with
king
and
was
received
alone
when
he
entered
she
cast
upon
him
a
hesitating
beseeching
look
but
when
he
said
my
mother
she
flew
into
his
arms
and
wept
upon
his
neck
then
you
do
not
hate
me
she
said
in
a
voice
choked
with
emotion
you
are
not
ashamed
to
call
me
mother
it
was
only
yesterday
he
replied
that
i
thought
with
pride
and
joy
of
the
possibility
that
i
might
some
day
call
you
by
that
dear
name
if
i
had
heard
these
particulars
without
knowing
you
they
might
have
repelled
me
but
i
have
admired
you
from
the
first
moment
i
have
lately
been
learning
to
love
you
and
i
am
familiar
with
the
thought
of
being
your
son
she
raised
her
expressive
eyes
to
his
with
such
a
look
of
love
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
giving
her
a
filial
kiss
and
pressing
her
warmly
to
his
heart
i
was
so
afraid
you
would
regard
me
with
dislike
said
she
you
can
understand
now
why
it
made
me
so
faint
to
think
of
singing
ah
with
you
at
party
how
could
i
have
borne
your
tones
of
anguish
when
you
discovered
that
you
were
connected
with
the
borgias
and
how
could
i
have
helped
falling
on
your
neck
when
you
sang
but
i
must
not
forget
that
the
mother
who
tended
your
childhood
has
the
best
claim
to
your
affection
she
added
mournfully
i
love
her
and
always
shall
love
her
it
can
not
be
otherwise
rejoined
he
it
has
been
the
pleasant
habit
of
so
many
years
but
ought
i
not
to
consider
myself
a
lucky
fellow
to
have
two
such
mothers
i
do
know
how
i
am
to
distinguish
you
i
must
call
you
and
i
believe
she
smiled
as
he
spoke
and
she
said
then
it
has
not
made
you
so
unhappy
to
know
that
you
are
my
son
his
countenance
changed
as
he
replied
my
only
unhappiness
is
the
loss
of
eulalia
that
disappointment
i
must
bear
as
i
can
you
are
both
very
young
rejoined
she
and
perhaps
you
may
see
another
i
do
want
to
hear
about
that
now
he
exclaimed
impetuously
moving
hastily
toward
the
window
against
which
he
leaned
for
a
moment
when
he
turned
he
saw
that
his
mother
was
weeping
and
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
forehead
with
tender
apologies
for
his
abruptness
thank
god
she
said
for
these
brief
moments
of
happiness
with
my
son
yes
they
must
be
brief
he
replied
i
must
go
away
and
stay
away
but
i
shall
always
think
of
you
with
affection
and
cherish
the
deepest
sympathy
for
your
wrongs
and
sufferings
again
she
folded
him
in
her
arms
and
they
kissed
and
blessed
each
other
at
parting
she
gazed
after
him
wistfully
till
he
was
out
of
sight
alas
murmured
she
he
can
not
be
a
son
to
me
and
i
can
not
be
a
mother
to
him
she
recalled
the
lonely
sad
hours
when
she
embroidered
his
baby
clothes
with
none
but
tulee
to
sympathize
with
her
she
remembered
how
the
little
black
silky
head
looked
as
she
first
fondled
him
on
her
arm
and
the
tears
began
to
flow
like
rain
but
she
roused
in
a
few
moments
saying
to
herself
this
is
all
wrong
and
selfish
i
ought
to
be
glad
that
he
loves
his
that
he
can
live
with
her
and
that
her
heart
will
not
be
made
desolate
by
my
fault
o
father
of
mercies
this
is
hard
to
bear
help
me
to
bear
it
as
i
ought
she
bowed
her
head
in
silence
for
a
while
then
rising
up
she
said
have
i
not
my
lovely
eulalia
poor
child
i
must
be
very
tender
with
her
in
this
trial
of
her
young
heart
she
saw
there
was
need
to
be
very
tender
when
a
farewell
card
was
sent
the
next
day
with
a
bouquet
of
delicate
flowers
from
gerald
fitzgerald
chapter
xxxii
the
next
morning
after
these
conversations
blumenthal
who
was
as
yet
unconscious
of
the
secret
they
had
revealed
was
singing
in
the
garden
while
she
gathered
some
flowers
for
her
vases
mr
bright
who
was
cutting
up
weeds
stopped
and
listened
keeping
time
on
the
handle
of
his
hoe
when
flora
came
up
to
him
she
glanced
at
the
motion
of
his
fingers
and
smiled
ca
help
it
said
he
when
i
hear
your
voice
it
as
much
as
ever
i
can
do
to
keep
from
dancing
but
if
i
should
do
that
i
should
shock
my
neighbor
the
deacon
did
you
see
the
stage
stop
there
last
night
they
got
visitors
from
carolina
his
daughter
and
her
husband
and
children
i
reckon
i
stirred
him
up
yesterday
he
came
to
my
shop
to
pay
for
some
shoeing
he
had
done
so
i
invited
him
to
attend
our
meeting
evening
he
took
it
as
an
insult
and
said
he
did
need
to
be
instructed
by
such
sort
of
men
as
spoke
at
our
meetings
know
some
of
us
are
what
they
call
mudsills
down
south
said
i
it
might
do
you
good
to
go
and
hear
deacon
when
a
man
lamp
out
it
better
to
light
it
by
the
kitchen
fire
than
to
go
blundering
about
in
the
dark
hitting
himself
against
everything
he
said
we
should
find
it
very
convenient
if
we
had
slaves
here
for
northern
women
were
mere
beasts
of
burden
i
told
him
that
was
better
than
to
be
beasts
of
prey
i
thought
afterward
i
was
very
polite
i
mean
to
go
headlong
against
other
folks
prejudices
but
the
fact
is
a
man
never
knows
with
what
impetus
he
going
till
he
comes
up
against
a
post
i
like
to
see
a
man
firm
as
a
rock
in
his
opinions
i
have
a
sort
of
a
respect
for
a
even
if
it
a
little
mossy
but
when
i
come
across
a
i
like
to
give
it
a
shaking
to
find
out
whether
it
rotten
at
the
foundation
as
to
things
in
general
i
calculate
to
be
an
obliging
neighbor
but
i
shall
keep
a
lookout
on
these
carolina
folks
if
they
brought
any
blacks
with
i
shall
let
know
what
the
laws
of
massachusetts
are
and
then
they
may
take
their
freedom
or
not
just
as
they
choose
that
right
replied
blumenthal
and
when
you
and
the
deacon
have
another
encounter
i
hope
i
shall
be
near
enough
to
hear
it
as
she
walked
away
tying
up
her
bouquet
with
a
spear
of
striped
grass
she
heard
him
whistling
the
tune
she
had
been
singing
when
she
returned
to
the
parlor
she
seated
herself
near
the
open
window
with
a
handkerchief
on
which
she
was
embroidering
delano
initials
mr
bright
remarks
had
somewhat
excited
her
curiosity
and
from
time
to
time
she
glanced
toward
deacon
stillham
grounds
a
hawthorn
hedge
neatly
clipped
separated
the
two
gardens
but
here
and
there
the
foliage
had
died
away
and
left
small
open
spaces
all
at
once
a
pretty
little
curly
head
appeared
at
one
of
these
leafy
lunettes
and
an
infantile
voice
called
out
you
a
do
come
here
mamita
lila
and
see
this
little
darling
said
flora
laughing
for
a
moment
she
was
invisible
then
the
cherub
face
came
peeping
out
again
and
this
time
the
little
mouth
was
laughing
when
it
repeated
you
a
is
it
amusing
to
hear
such
an
infant
trying
to
abuse
us
with
a
big
mouthful
of
a
word
to
which
she
attaches
no
meaning
said
delano
flora
beckoned
with
her
hand
and
called
out
come
in
and
see
the
bobolithonithts
darling
the
little
creature
laughed
and
ran
away
at
that
moment
a
bright
turban
was
seen
moving
along
above
the
bushes
then
a
black
face
became
visible
flora
sprang
up
with
a
quick
cry
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
upsetting
her
basket
and
leaving
balls
and
thimble
rolling
about
the
floor
placing
her
foot
on
a
stump
she
leaped
over
the
hedge
like
an
and
the
next
moment
she
had
the
negro
woman
in
her
arms
exclaiming
bless
you
tulee
you
alive
after
all
the
black
woman
was
startled
and
bewildered
for
an
instant
then
she
held
her
off
at
arm
length
and
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
saying
bless
the
lord
is
it
you
missy
flory
or
is
it
a
sperit
well
now
it
you
little
one
yes
tulee
it
is
i
she
replied
the
same
missy
flory
that
used
to
plague
your
life
out
with
her
tricks
the
colored
woman
hugged
and
kissed
and
hugged
and
kissed
and
laughed
and
cried
ever
and
anon
exclaiming
bless
the
lord
meanwhile
the
playful
cherub
was
peeping
at
joe
bright
through
another
hole
in
the
hedge
all
unconscious
how
pretty
her
little
fair
face
looked
in
its
frame
of
green
leaves
but
delighted
with
her
own
sauciness
as
she
repeated
you
a
you
a
when
he
tried
to
kiss
her
she
scampered
away
but
soon
reappeared
again
to
renew
the
fun
while
this
was
going
on
a
white
servant
came
through
the
deacon
grounds
and
said
to
tulee
robbem
wants
you
to
come
to
her
immediately
and
bring
laura
i
must
go
now
darling
said
tulee
clasping
flora
hand
with
a
warm
pressure
come
again
quickly
said
flora
as
soon
as
i
can
she
replied
and
hurried
away
with
her
little
charge
when
mr
bright
offered
his
hand
to
help
blumenthal
over
the
hedge
he
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
was
it
funny
said
he
to
hear
that
baby
calling
us
they
begin
education
early
down
south
before
the
summer
is
out
she
be
talking
about
the
cuth
o
ham
and
telling
the
story
of
onethimuth
but
they
found
a
mare
nest
now
blumenthal
the
deacon
will
be
writing
to
his
carolina
friends
how
the
massachusetts
ladies
hug
and
kiss
niggers
flora
smiled
as
she
answered
i
suppose
it
must
seem
strange
to
them
mr
bright
but
the
fact
is
that
black
woman
tended
me
when
i
was
a
child
and
i
have
seen
her
for
twenty
years
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
house
she
explained
the
scene
to
delano
and
then
said
to
her
daughter
now
rosen
blumen
you
may
leave
your
drawing
and
go
to
aunt
rosa
and
tell
her
i
want
to
see
her
for
something
special
and
she
must
come
as
soon
as
possible
tell
her
anything
more
you
may
stay
and
spend
the
day
with
eulalia
if
you
like
how
many
mysteries
and
surprises
we
have
observed
delano
a
dozen
novels
might
be
made
out
of
your
adventures
the
hasty
summons
found
king
still
melancholy
with
the
thought
that
her
newly
found
son
could
be
no
more
to
her
than
a
shadow
glad
to
have
her
thoughts
turned
in
another
direction
she
sent
rosen
blumen
to
her
cousin
and
immediately
prepared
to
join
her
sister
flora
who
was
watching
for
her
ran
out
to
the
gate
to
meet
her
and
before
she
entered
the
house
announced
that
tulee
was
alive
the
little
that
was
known
was
soon
communicated
and
they
watched
with
the
greatest
anxiety
for
the
reappearance
of
tulee
but
the
bright
turban
was
seen
no
more
during
the
forenoon
and
throughout
the
afternoon
no
one
but
the
deacon
and
his
gardener
were
visible
about
the
grounds
the
hours
of
waiting
were
spent
by
the
sisters
and
delano
in
a
full
explanation
of
the
secret
history
of
gerald
fitzgerald
and
king
consequent
depression
of
spirits
the
evening
wore
away
without
any
tidings
from
tulee
between
nine
and
ten
they
heard
the
voice
of
the
deacon
loud
in
prayer
joe
bright
who
was
passing
the
open
window
stopped
to
say
he
means
his
neighbors
shall
hear
him
anyhow
i
reckon
he
thinks
it
a
good
investment
for
character
a
cute
manager
the
deacon
is
and
a
quickster
too
according
to
his
own
account
for
he
told
me
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
religion
he
was
half
an
hour
about
it
i
a
mind
to
tell
him
i
should
think
religion
was
a
job
done
by
contract
knocked
up
in
a
hurry
mr
bright
said
flora
in
a
low
voice
if
you
see
that
colored
woman
i
wish
you
would
speak
to
her
and
show
her
the
way
in
the
sisters
sat
talking
over
their
affairs
with
their
husbands
in
low
tones
listening
anxiously
meanwhile
to
every
sound
and
king
were
just
saying
they
thought
it
was
best
to
return
home
when
mr
bright
opened
the
door
and
tulee
walked
in
of
course
there
was
a
general
exclaiming
and
embracing
there
was
no
need
of
introducing
the
husbands
for
tulee
remembered
them
both
as
soon
as
she
could
take
breath
she
said
i
had
a
time
to
get
here
i
been
trying
all
day
and
i
could
get
a
chance
they
kept
such
watch
of
me
at
last
when
they
was
all
abed
and
asleep
i
crept
down
stairs
softly
and
come
out
of
the
back
door
and
locked
it
after
me
come
right
up
stairs
with
me
said
rosa
i
want
to
speak
to
you
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
she
said
tulee
where
is
the
baby
do
know
no
more
than
the
dead
what
become
of
the
poor
little
picaninny
she
replied
after
ye
went
away
missy
duroy
cousin
who
was
a
brought
his
baby
with
a
black
nurse
to
board
there
because
his
wife
had
died
i
remember
how
ye
looked
at
me
when
ye
said
good
care
of
the
poor
little
baby
and
i
did
try
to
take
good
care
of
him
i
toted
him
about
a
bit
out
doors
whenever
i
could
get
a
chance
one
day
just
as
i
was
going
back
into
the
house
a
gentleman
turned
and
looked
at
me
i
did
think
anything
about
it
then
but
the
next
day
he
come
to
the
house
and
he
said
i
was
royal
slave
and
that
fitzgerald
bought
me
he
wanted
to
know
where
ye
was
and
when
i
told
him
ye
gone
over
the
sea
with
madame
and
the
signor
he
cursed
and
swore
and
said
been
cheated
when
he
went
away
missis
duroy
said
it
was
bruteman
i
did
think
there
was
much
to
be
of
got
away
safe
and
i
had
free
papers
and
the
picaninny
was
too
small
to
be
sold
but
i
remembered
ye
was
always
anxious
about
his
being
a
slave
and
i
was
a
little
uneasy
one
day
when
the
came
to
see
his
baby
he
was
marking
an
anchor
on
his
own
arm
with
a
needle
and
some
sort
of
black
stuff
and
he
said
would
never
come
out
i
thought
if
they
should
carry
off
yer
picaninny
it
would
be
more
easy
to
find
him
again
if
he
was
marked
i
told
the
captain
i
had
heard
ye
call
him
gerald
and
he
said
he
would
mark
on
his
arm
the
poor
little
thing
worried
in
his
sleep
while
he
was
doing
it
and
missis
duroy
scolded
at
me
for
hurting
him
the
next
week
massa
duroy
was
taken
with
and
then
missis
duroy
was
taken
and
then
the
captain
baby
and
the
black
nurse
i
was
frighted
and
tried
to
keep
the
picaninny
out
doors
all
i
could
one
day
when
i
gone
a
bit
from
the
house
two
men
grabbed
us
and
put
us
in
a
cart
when
i
screamed
they
beat
me
and
swore
at
me
for
a
runaway
nigger
when
i
said
i
was
free
they
beat
me
more
and
told
me
to
shut
up
they
put
us
in
the
calaboose
and
when
i
told
the
picaninny
belonged
to
a
white
lady
they
laughed
and
said
there
was
a
great
many
white
niggers
bruteman
come
to
see
us
and
he
said
we
was
his
niggers
when
i
showed
him
my
free

dark
cheek
she
had
so
often
kissed
when
they
were
children
together
and
they
parted
for
the
night
the
next
day
and
the
next
night
passed
without
a
visit
from
tulee
and
mrs
bright
who
entered
into
the
affair
with
the
liveliest
interest
expressed
the
opinion
that
she
had
been
spirited
away
and
sent
south
the
sisters
began
to
entertain
a
similar
fear
and
it
was
decided
that
their
husbands
should
call
with
them
the
following
morning
to
have
a
talk
with
and
robbem
but
not
long
after

she
i
tried
to
get
here
last
night
but
missis
robbem
takes
a
heap
o
care
o
me
she
said
this
with
a
mischievous
smile
when
we
was
at
the
astor
house
she
locked
up
my
clothes
in
her
room
new
york
was
such
a
dreadful
wicked
place
she
was
they
be
stole
and
she
never
let
me
out
o
her
sight
for
fear
the
colored
waiters
in
the
hotel
would
be
impudent
to
me
last
night
she
sent
me
away
up
into
the
cupola
to
sleep
she
said
i
could
have
more
room
there
and
when
i
got
the
picaninny
asleep
and
was
watching
for
a
chance
to
steal
away
she
come
all
the
way
up
there
very
softly
and
said
she
brought
me
some
hot
drink
i
seem
to
be
well
then
she
begun
to
advise
me
not
to
go
near
the
next
house
she
told
me
abolitionists
was
very
bad
people
that
they
pretended
to
be
great
friends
to
colored
folks
but
all
they
wanted
was
to
steal
and
sell
to
the
west
indies
i
told
her
i
know
nothing
abolitionists
that
the
lady
i
was
hugging
and
kissing
was
a
new
orleans
lady
that
i
used
to
wait
upon
when
we
was
picaninnies
she
said
if
you
had
the
feelings
southern
ladies
ought
to
have
you
would
be
boarding
with
abolitionists
when
she
went
down
stairs
i
did
dare
to
come
here
for
fear
she
come
up
again
with
some
more
hot
drink
this
morning
she
told
me
to
walk
up
street
with
the
picaninny
and
she
watched
me
till
i
was
out
o
sight
but
i
went
round
and
round
and
got
over
a
fence
and
come
through
massa
barn
and
king
came
in
as
she
was
speaking
and
she
turned
to
them
saying
anxiously
do
you
think
massa
if
i
do
go
back
with
they
let
me
have
my
do
call
me
massa
replied
king
i
dislike
the
sound
of
it
speak
to
me
as
other
people
do
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
manage
it
so
that
you
will
have
your
children
i
will
lead
home
this
pretty
little
tot
and
tell
them
you
are
going
to
stay
with
us
with
bonbons
and
funny
talk
he
gained
the
favor
of
tot
so
that
she
consented
to
walk
with
him
tulee
often
applied
her
apron
to
her
eyes
as
she
watched
the
little
creature
holding
by
his
finger
and
stepping
along
in
childish
fashion
turning
her
toes
inward
when
she
disappeared
through
the
deacon
front
door
she
sat
down
and
cried
outright
i
love
that
little
picaninny
sobbed
she
i
tended
her
ever
since
she
was
born
and
i
love
her
she
cry
for
tulee
but
i
does
want
to
be
free
and
i
does
want
to
live
with
ye
missy
rosy
and
missy
flory
robbem
met
king
as
soon
as
he
entered
her
father
door
and
said
in
a
tone
of
stern
surprise
where
is
my
servant
sir
he
bowed
and
answered
if
you
will
allow
me
to
walk
in
for
a
few
moments
i
will
explain
my
errand
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
he
said
i
came
to
inform
you
that
tulee
does
not
wish
to
go
back
to
carolina
and
that
by
the
laws
of
massachusetts
she
has
a
perfect
right
to
remain
here
she
an
ungrateful
wench
exclaimed
robbem
she
always
been
treated
kindly
and
she
would
have
thought
of
taking
such
a
step
if
she
had
been
put
up
to
it
by
meddlesome
abolitionists
who
are
always
interfering
with
gentlemen
servants
the
simple
fact
is
rejoined
king
tulee
used
to
be
the
playmate
and
attendant
of
my
wife
when
both
of
them
were
children
they
lived
together
many
years
and
are
strongly
attached
to
each
other
if
your
wife
is
a
southern
lady
replied
robbem
she
ought
to
be
above
such
a
mean
yankee
trick
as
stealing
my
servant
from
me
her
husband
entered
at
that
moment
and
the
visitor
rose
and
bowed
as
he
said
robbem
i
presume
he
lowered
his
head
somewhat
stiffly
in
reply
and
his
wife
hastened
to
say
the
abolitionists
have
been
decoying
tulee
away
from
us
king
repeated
the
explanation
he
had
already
made
i
thought
the
wench
had
more
feeling
replied
robbem
she
left
children
in
carolina
but
the
fact
is
niggers
have
no
more
feeling
for
their
young
than
so
many
pigs
i
judge
differently
rejoined
king
and
my
principal
motive
for
calling
was
to
speak
to
you
about
those
children
i
wish
to
purchase
them
for
tulee
she
shall
never
have
them
sir
exclaimed
the
fiercely
and
as
for
you
abolitionists
all
i
wish
is
that
we
had
you
down
south
differences
of
opinion
must
be
allowed
in
a
free
country
replied
king
i
consider
slavery
a
bad
institution
injurious
to
the
south
and
to
the
whole
country
but
i
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
that
subject
i
simply
wish
to
make
a
plain
business
statement
to
you
tulee
chooses
to
take
her
freedom
and
any
court
in
massachusetts
will
decide
that
she
has
a
right
to
take
it
but
out
of
gratitude
for
services
she
has
rendered
my
wife
i
am
willing
to
make
you
gratuitous
compensation
provided
you
will
enable
me
to
buy
all
her
children
will
you
name
your
terms
now
or
shall
i
call
again
she
shall
never
have
her
children
repeated
robbem
she
has
nobody
but
herself
and
the
abolitionists
to
blame
for
it
i
will
however
call
again
after
you
have
thought
of
it
more
calmly
said
king
good
morning
sir
good
morning
madam
his
salutations
were
silently
returned
with
cold
stiff
bows
a
second
and
third
attempt
was
made
with
no
better
success
tulee
grew
very
uneasy
they
sell
my
benny
said
she
ye
see
they
ai
got
any
heart
they
used
to
selling
picaninnies
what
does
this
robbem
carry
on
the
deacon
old
business
inquired
mr
bright
yes
massa
replied
tulee
two
years
ago
massa
stillham
come
down
to
caroliny
to
spend
the
winter
and
he
was
round
in
the
as
brisk
as
massa
robbem
counting
the
niggers
and
telling
how
many
dollars
they
ought
to
sell
for
he
had
a
dreadful
bad
fever
while
he
was
down
there
and
i
nursed
him
he
was
out
of
his
head
half
the
time
and
he
was
calling
out
going
how
much
for
this
likely
nigger
stop
that
wench
squalling
for
her
brat
carry
the
brat
off
it
was
dreadful
to
hear
him
i
suppose
he
calculated
upon
going
to
heaven
if
he
died
rejoined
mr
bright
and
if
he
gone
into
the
kingdom
with
such
words
in
his
mouth
it
would
have
been
a
heavenly
song
for
the
elders
to
accompany
with
their
golden
harps
they
sell
my
benny
groaned
tulee
and
then
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
have
no
doubt
king
will
obtain
your
children
replied
mr
bright
and
you
should
remember
that
if
you
go
back
south
just
as
likely
as
not
they
will
sell
him
where
you
will
never
see
him
or
hear
from
him
i
know
it
massa
i
know
it
answered
she
i
am
not
your
master
rejoined
he
i
allow
no
man
to
call
me
master
and
certainly
not
any
woman
though
i
do
belong
to
the
chivalry
his
prediction
proved
true
the
deacon
and
his
held
frequent
consultations
this
king
is
rich
as
croesus
said
the
deacon
and
if
he
thinks
his
wife
owes
a
debt
to
tulee
he
be
willing
to
give
a
round
sum
for
her
children
i
reckon
you
can
make
a
better
bargain
with
him
than
you
could
in
the
new
orleans
market
do
you
suppose
he
give
five
thousand
dollars
for
the
young
niggers
inquired
the
trader
try
him
said
the
deacon
the
final
result
was
that
the
sum
was
deposited
by
king
to
be
paid
over
whenever
tulee
children
made
their
appearance
and
in
due
time
they
all
arrived
tulee
was
full
of
joy
and
gratitude
but
mr
bright
always
maintained
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
pay
so
much
for
what
never
belonged
to
them
of
course
there
were
endless
questions
to
be
asked
and
answered
between
the
sisters
and
their
faithful
servant
but
all
she
could
tell
threw
no
further
light
on
the
destiny
of
the
little
changeling
whom
she
supposed
to
be
rosa
own
child
in
the
course
of
these
private
conversations
it
came
out
that
she
herself
had
suffered
as
all
women
must
suffer
who
have
the
feelings
of
human
beings
and
the
treatment
of
animals
but
her
own
humble
little
episode
of
love
and
separation
of
sorrow
and
shame
was
whispered
only
to
missy
rosy
and
missy
flory
chapter
xxxiii
the
probability
that
the
lost
child
was
alive
and
in
slavery
was
a
very
serious
complication
of
existing
difficulties
thinking
it
prudent
to
prepare
gerald
mind
for
any
contingencies
that
might
occur
king
proceeded
immediately
to
boston
to
have
a
conference
with
him
the
young
man
received
the
news
with
unexpected
composure
it
will
annoy
very
much
said
he
and
on
that
account
i
regret
it
but
so
far
as
i
am
myself
concerned
it
would
in
some
respects
be
a
relief
to
me
to
get
out
of
the
false
position
in
which
i
find
myself
grandfather
bell
has
always
grumbled
about
the
expense
i
have
been
to
him
in
consequence
of
my
father
loss
of
fortune
and
of
course
that
adds
to
the
unpleasantness
of
feeling
that
i
am
practising
a
fraud
upon
him
he
is
just
now
peculiarly
vexed
with
me
for
leaving
northampton
so
suddenly
he
considers
it
an
unaccountable
caprice
of
mine
and
reproaches
me
with
letting
eulalia
slip
through
my
fingers
as
he
expresses
it
of
course
he
has
no
idea
how
it
cuts
me
this
state
of
things
is
producing
a
great
change
in
my
views
my
prevailing
wish
now
is
to
obtain
an
independent
position
by
my
own
exertions
and
thus
be
free
to
become
familiar
with
my
new
self
at
present
i
feel
as
if
there
were
two
of
me
and
that
one
was
an
impostor
i
heartily
approve
of
your
wish
to
rely
upon
your
own
resources
replied
king
and
i
will
gladly
assist
you
to
accomplish
it
i
have
already
said
you
should
be
to
me
as
a
son
and
i
stand
by
my
word
but
i
advise
you
as
i
would
an
own
son
to
devote
yourself
assiduously
to
some
business
profession
or
art
never
be
a
gentleman
of
leisure
it
is
the
worst
possible
calling
a
man
can
have
nothing
but
stagnation
of
faculties
and
weariness
of
soul
comes
of
it
but
we
will
talk
about
plans
hereafter
the
urgent
business
of
the
present
moment
is
to
obtain
some
clew
to
your
missing
brother
my
conscientious
wife
will
suffer
continual
anxiety
till
he
is
found
i
must
go
to
new
orleans
and
seek
out
bruteman
to
ascertain
whether
he
has
sold
him
bruteman
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
sudden
interest
was
he
the
one
who
seized
that
negro
woman
and
the
child
yes
rejoined
king
but
why
does
that
excite
your
interest
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
replied
gerald
but
you
know
i
was
educated
in
the
prejudices
of
my
father
and
grandfather
it
was
natural
that
i
should
be
proud
of
being
the
son
of
a
slaveholder
that
i
should
despise
the
colored
race
and
consider
abolition
a
very
vulgar
fanaticism
but
the
recent
discovery
that
i
was
myself
born
a
slave
has
put
me
upon
my
thoughts
and
made
me
a
little
uneasy
about
a
transaction
in
which
i
was
concerned
the
afternoon
preceding
green
splendid
ball
where
i
first
saw
my
beautiful
two
fugitive
slaves
arrived
here
in
one
of
grandfather
ships
called
king
cotton
bruteman
telegraphed
to
grandfather
about
them
and
the
next
morning
he
sent
me
to
tell
captain
kane
to
send
the
slaves
down
to
the
islands
in
the
harbor
and
keep
them
under
guard
till
a
vessel
passed
that
would
take
them
back
to
new
orleans
i
did
his
errand
without
bestowing
upon
the
subjects
of
it
any
more
thought
or
care
than
i
should
have
done
upon
two
bales
of
cotton
at
parting
captain
kane
said
to
me
george
fitzgerald
one
of
these
fellows
looks
so
much
like
you
that
if
you
were
a
little
tanned
by
exposure
to
the
sun
i
should
know
you
apart
flattering
replied
i
be
compared
to
a
negro
and
i
hurried
away
being
impatient
to
make
an
early
call
upon
your
lady
at
the
revere
house
i
do
suppose
i
should
ever
have
thought
of
it
again
if
your
present
conversation
had
not
brought
it
to
my
mind
do
you
know
whether
bruteman
sold
those
slaves
after
they
were
sent
back
inquired
king
there
is
one
fact
connected
with
the
affair
which
i
will
tell
you
if
you
promise
not
to
mention
it
replied
the
young
man
the
abolitionists
annoyed
grandfather
a
good
deal
about
those
runaways
and
he
is
nervously
sensitive
lest
they
should
get
hold
of
it
and
publish
it
in
their
papers
having
received
the
desired
promise
he
went
on
to
say
those
slaves
were
mortgaged
to
grandfather
and
he
sent
orders
to
have
them
immediately
sold
i
presume
bruteman
managed
the
transaction
for
they
were
his
slaves
but
i
do
know
whether
he
reported
the
name
of
the
purchaser
he
died
two
months
ago
leaving
his
affairs
a
good
deal
involved
and
i
heard
that
some
distant
connections
in
mississippi
were
his
heirs
where
can
i
find
captain
kane
inquired
king
he
sailed
for
calcutta
a
fortnight
ago
rejoined
gerald
then
there
is
no
other
resource
but
to
go
to
new
orleans
as
soon
as
the
weather
will
permit
was
the
reply
i
honor
your
zeal
said
the
young
man
i
wish
my
own
record
was
clean
on
the
subject
since
i
have
taken
the
case
home
to
myself
i
have
felt
that
it
was
mean
and
wrong
to
send
back
fugitives
from
slavery
but
it
becomes
painful
when
i
think
of
the
possibility
of
having
helped
to
send
back
my
own
brother
and
one
too
whom
i
have
supplanted
in
his
birthright
when
king
returned
to
northampton
the
information
he
had
obtained
sent
a
new
pang
to
the
heart
of
his
wife
then
he
a
slave
she
exclaimed
and
while
the
poor
fellow
was
being
bound
and
sent
back
to
slavery
i
was
dancing
and
receiving
homage
verily
the
furies
do
pursue
me
do
you
think
it
is
necessary
to
tell
fitzgerald
of
this
in
a
reverse
of
cases
i
think
you
would
feel
that
you
ought
to
be
informed
of
everything
he
replied
but
i
will
save
you
from
that
portion
of
the
pain
it
was
most
fitting
that
a
woman
should
make
the
first
part
of
the
disclosure
but
this
new
light
on
the
subject
can
be
as
well
revealed
by
myself
always
kind
and
considerate
she
said
this
news
will
be
peculiarly
annoying
to
her
and
perhaps
she
will
receive
it
better
from
you
than
from
me
for
i
can
see
that
i
have
lost
her
favor
but
you
have
taught
me
that
it
is
of
more
consequence
to
favor
than
to
it
and
i
shall
do
my
utmost
to
deserve
a
kindly
estimate
from
her
i
confess
i
am
somewhat
puzzled
by
this
tangle
rejoined
her
husband
but
where
there
is
both
the
will
and
the
means
to
repair
a
wrong
it
will
be
strange
if
a
way
can
not
be
found
i
would
like
to
sell
my
diamonds
and
all
my
other
expensive
ornaments
to
buy
that
young
man
said
she
that
you
can
do
if
it
will
be
any
gratification
to
you
he
replied
but
the
few
thousands
i
have
invested
in
jewels
for
you
would
go
but
little
way
toward
the
full
remuneration
i
intend
to
make
if
he
can
be
found
we
will
send
the
young
people
out
of
the
way
this
evening
and
lay
the
case
before
a
family
council
of
the
elders
i
should
like
to
consult
blumenthal
i
have
never
known
a
man
whose
natural
instincts
were
so
true
as
his
and
his
entire
freedom
from
conventional
prejudices
reminds
me
of
my
good
father
i
have
great
reliance
also
on
delano
delicate
perceptions
and
quiet
good
sense
and
our
lively
little
flora
though
she
jumps
to
her
conclusions
always
jumps
in
a
straight
line
and
usually
hits
the
point
as
soon
as
the
council
was
convened
and
the
subject
introduced
blumenthal
exclaimed
why
florimond
those
slaves
in
king
cotton
were
the
ones
you
and
goldwin
tried
so
hard
to
help
them
find
yes
rejoined
he
i
caught
a
hasty
glimpse
of
one
of
the
poor
fellows
just
as
they
were
seizing
him
with
the
cry
of
thief
and
his
italian
look
reminded
me
so
forcibly
of
the
danger
flora
was
once
in
that
i
was
extremely
troubled
about
him
after
i
heard
he
was
a
slave
as
i
recall
him
to
my
mind
i
do
think
he
resembled
young
fitzgerald
percival
might
perhaps
throw
some
light
on
the
subject
for
he
was
unwearied
in
his
efforts
to
rescue
those
fugitives
he
already
knows
flora
history
i
should
like
to
have
you
go
to
boston
with
me
and
introduce
me
to
him
said
king
that
i
will
do
answered
blumenthal
i
think
both
bell
and
fitzgerald
would
prefer
to
have
it
all
sink
into
unquestioned
oblivion
but
that
does
not
change
our
duty
with
regard
to
the
poor
fellow
do
you
think
they
ought
to
be
informed
of
the
present
circumstances
inquired
king
if
i
were
in
their
position
i
should
think
i
ought
to
know
all
the
particulars
replied
he
and
the
golden
rule
is
as
good
as
it
is
simple
fitzgerald
has
great
dread
of
her
father
knowing
anything
about
it
responded
rosa
and
i
have
an
earnest
desire
to
spare
her
pain
as
far
as
possible
it
seems
as
if
she
had
a
right
to
judge
in
the
premises
delano
took
blumenthal
view
of
the
subject
and
it
was
decided
to
leave
that
point
for
further
consideration
flora
suggested
that
some
difficulties
might
be
removed
by
at
once
informing
eulalia
that
gerald
was
her
brother
but
delano
answered
some
difficulties
might
be
avoided
for
ourselves
by
that
process
but
the
good
of
the
young
people
is
a
paramount
consideration
you
know
none
of
them
are
aware
of
all
the
antecedents
in
their
family
history
and
it
seems
to
me
best
that
they
should
not
know
them
till
their
characters
are
fully
formed
i
should
have
no
objection
to
telling
them
of
their
colored
ancestry
if
it
did
not
involve
a
knowledge
of
laws
and
customs
and
experiences
growing
out
of
slavery
which
might
at
this
early
age
prove
unsettling
to
their
principles
anything
that
mystifies
moral
perceptions
is
not
so
easily
removed
from
youthful
minds
as
breath
is
wiped
from
a
mirror
i
have
that
feeling
very
deeply
fixed
with
regard
to
our
eulalia
observed
king
and
i
really
see
no
need
of
agitating
their
young
unconscious
minds
with
subjects
they
are
too
inexperienced
to
understand
i
will
have
a
talk
with
fitzgerald
and
then
proceed
to
boston
fitzgerald
received
the
announcement
with
much
less
equanimity
than
she
had
manifested
on
a
former
occasion
though
habitually
polite
she
said
very
abruptly
i
was
in
hopes
i
should
never
be
troubled
any
more
with
this
vulgar
subject
since
king
saw
fit
to
change
the
children
let
her
take
care
of
the
one
she
has
chosen
of
course
it
would
be
very
disagreeable
to
me
to
have
a
son
who
had
been
brought
up
among
slaves
if
i
wished
to
make
his
acquaintance
i
could
not
do
it
without
exciting
a
great
deal
of
remark
and
there
has
already
been
too
much
talk
about
my
husband
affairs
but
i
have
no
wish
to
see
him
i
have
educated
a
son
to
my
own
liking
and
everybody
says
he
is
an
elegant
young
man
if
you
would
cease
from
telling
me
that
there
is
a
stain
in
his
blood
i
should
never
be
reminded
of
it
we
thought
it
right
to
inform
you
of
everything
rejoined
king
and
leave
you
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
then
once
for
all
said
she
please
leave
gerald
and
me
in
peace
and
do
what
you
choose
about
the
other
one
we
have
had
sufficient
annoyance
already
and
i
never
wish
to
hear
the
subject
mentioned
again
i
accept
your
decision
replied
king
if
the
unfortunate
young
man
can
be
found
i
will
educate
him
and
establish
him
in
business
and
do
the
same
for
him
in
all
respects
that
you
would
have
done
if
he
had
been
your
acknowledged
heir
and
keep
him
at
a
distance
from
me
said
the
perturbed
lady
for
if
he
resembles
gerald
so
strongly
it
would
of
course
give
rise
to
unpleasant
inquiries
and
remarks
the
gentleman
bowed
wished
her
good
morning
and
departed
thinking
what
he
had
heard
was
a
strange
commentary
on
natural
instincts
percival
was
of
course
greatly
surprised
and
excited
when
he
learned
the
relation
which
one
of
the
fugitives
in
the
king
cotton
bore
to
bell
we
hear
a
good
deal
about
poetical
justice
said
he
but
one
rarely
sees
it
meted
out
in
this
world
the
hardness
of
the
old
merchant
when
jackson
and
i
called
upon
him
was
a
thing
to
be
remembered
he
indorsed
with
warm
approbation
the
declaration
of
the
reverend
gentleman
who
professed
his
willingness
to
send
his
mother
or
brother
into
slavery
if
the
laws
of
the
united
states
required
it
if
our
friend
mr
bright
was
with
us
he
would
say
the
lord
took
him
at
his
word
rejoined
blumenthal
smiling
an
earnest
discussion
ensued
concerning
the
possibilities
of
the
case
and
several
days
were
spent
in
active
investigation
but
all
the
additional
light
obtained
was
from
a
sailor
who
had
been
one
of
the
boat
crew
that
conveyed
the
fugitives
to
the
islands
in
the
harbor
and
all
he
could
tell
was
that
he
heard
them
call
each
other
george
and
henry
when
he
was
shown
a
colored
photograph
which
gerald
had
just
had
taken
for
his
he
at
once
said
that
was
the
one
named
george
this
poor
fellow
must
be
rescued
said
king
after
they
returned
from
their
unsatisfactory
conference
with
the
sailor
bell
may
know
who
purchased
him
and
a
conversation
with
him
seems
to
be
the
only
alternative
judging
by
my
own
experience
your
task
is
not
to
be
envied
rejoined
percival
he
will
be
in
a
tremendous
rage
but
perhaps
the
lesson
will
do
him
good
i
remember
francis
jackson
said
at
the
time
that
if
his
grandson
should
be
sent
into
slavery
it
might
bring
him
to
a
realizing
sense
of
the
state
of
things
he
was
doing
his
utmost
to
encourage
the
undertaking
did
indeed
seem
more
formidable
to
king
than
anything
he
had
yet
encountered
but
true
to
his
sense
of
duty
he
resolved
to
go
bravely
through
with
it
chapter
xxxiv
the
old
merchant
received
king
with
marked
politeness
for
though
he
suspected
him
of
proclivities
and
despised
him
for
that
weakness
he
had
great
respect
for
a
man
whose
name
was
as
good
as
gold
and
who
was
the
father
of
such
an
eligible
match
as
eulalia
after
some
discursive
conversation
king
said
i
am
desirous
to
tell
you
a
short
story
if
you
will
have
patience
to
listen
to
it
certainly
sir
replied
the
old
gentleman
his
visitor
accordingly
began
by
telling
of
royal
having
formed
one
of
those
quadroon
alliances
so
common
in
new
orleans
of
his
having
died
insolvent
and
of
his
two
handsome
octoroon
daughters
having
been
claimed
as
slaves
by
his
creditors
what
the
deuce
do
you
suppose
i
care
about
his
octoroon
daughters
interrupted
bell
impatiently
i
was
one
of
his
creditors
perhaps
you
will
take
some
interest
in
it
rejoined
king
when
i
tell
you
that
the
eldest
of
them
was
married
to
gerald
fitzgerald
of
savannah
and
that
she
is
still
living
do
you
mean
the
fitzgerald
who
married
my
daughter
lily
inquired
he
i
do
mean
him
was
the
response
it
false
vociferated
bell
growing
almost
purple
in
the
face
no
sir
it
is
not
false
replied
king
but
you
need
not
be
so
much
excited
the
first
marriage
did
not
render
the
second
illegal
first
because
a
sham
ceremony
was
performed
to
deceive
the
inexperienced
girl
and
secondly
because
according
to
the
laws
of
the
south
any
marriage
with
a
slave
however
sanctified
by
religious
forms
is
utterly
void
in
law
i
consider
such
a
law
a
very
wise
provision
replied
the
merchant
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
inferior
race
from
being
put
on
an
equality
with
their
superiors
the
negroes
were
made
to
be
servants
sir
may
be
an
advocate
for
amalgamation
but
i
am
not
i
would
simply
ask
you
to
observe
that
the
law
you
so
much
approve
is
not
a
preventive
of
amalgamation
fitzgerald
married
the
daughter
of
the
quadroon
the
only
effect
of
the
law
was
to
deprive
her
of
a
legal
right
to
his
support
and
protection
and
to
prevent
her
son
from
receiving
any
share
of
his
father
property
by
another
southern
law
that
child
shall
follow
the
condition
of
the
mother
her
son
became
a
slave
well
sir
what
interest
do
you
suppose
i
can
take
in
all
this
interrupted
the
merchant
it
nothing
to
me
sir
the
south
is
competent
to
make
her
own
laws
king
begged
his
attention
a
little
longer
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
how
fitzgerald
had
treated
the
octoroon
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
with
miss
bell
that
he
had
subsequently
sold
her
to
a
very
base
man
in
payment
of
a
debt
that
she
terrified
and
bewildered
by
the
prospect
of
such
a
fate
had
in
a
moment
of
frantic
revenge
changed
her
babe
for
his
daughter
and
that
consequently
the
gerald
he
had
been
educating
as
his
grandson
was
in
fact
the
son
of
the
octoroon
and
born
a
slave
really
sir
said
bell
with
a
satirical
smile
that
story
might
sell
for
something
to
a
writer
of
sensation
novels
but
i
should
hardly
have
expected
to
hear
it
from
a
sensible
gentleman
like
yourself
pray
on
whose
testimony
do
you
expect
me
to
believe
such
an
improbable
fiction
on
that
of
the
mother
herself
replied
king
with
a
very
contemptuous
curl
of
his
lip
bell
answered
and
you
really
suppose
do
you
that
i
can
be
induced
to
disinherit
my
grandson
on
the
testimony
of
a
colored
woman
not
i
sir
thank
god
i
am
not
infected
with
this
negro
mania
but
you
have
not
asked
who
the
woman
is
rejoined
king
and
without
knowing
that
you
can
not
judge
candidly
of
the
value
of
her
testimony
i
do
ask
because
i
do
care
replied
the
merchant
the
negroes
are
a
lying
set
sir
and
i
am
no
abolitionist
that
i
should
go
about
retailing
their
lies
king
looked
at
him
an
instant
and
then
answered
very
calmly
the
mother
of
that
babe
whose
word
you
treat
so
contemptuously
is
king
my
beloved
and
honored
wife
the
old
merchant
was
startled
from
his
propriety
and
forgetful
of
the
gout
in
his
feet
he
sprung
from
his
chair
exclaiming
the
devil
king
without
noticing
the
abrupt
exclamation
went
on
to
relate
in
detail
the
manner
of
his
first
introduction
to
miss
royal
his
compassion
for
her
subsequent
misfortunes
his
many
reasons
for
believing
her
a
pure
and
noble
woman
and
the
circumstances
which
finally
led
to
their
marriage
he
expressed
his
conviction
that
the
children
had
been
changed
in
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
and
dwelt
much
on
his
wife
exceeding
anxiety
to
atone
for
the
wrong
as
far
as
possible
i
was
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
said
he
until
the
increasing
attraction
between
gerald
and
eulalia
made
an
avowal
necessary
it
gives
me
great
pain
to
tell
you
all
this
but
i
thought
that
under
a
reverse
of
circumstances
i
should
myself
prefer
to
know
the
facts
i
am
desirous
to
do
my
utmost
to
repair
the
mischief
done
by
a
deserted
and
friendless
woman
at
a
moment
when
she
was
crazed
by
distress
and
terror
a
woman
too
whose
character
i
have
abundant
reason
to
love
and
honor
if
you
choose
to
disinherit
gerald
i
will
provide
for
his
future
as
if
he
were
my
own
son
and
i
will
repay
with
interest
all
the
expense
you
have
incurred
for
him
i
hope
that
this
affair
may
be
kept
secret
from
the
world
and
that
we
may
amicably
settle
it
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
will
be
materially
injured
somewhat
mollified
by
this
proposal
the
old
gentleman
inquired
in
a
milder
tone
and
where
is
the
young
man
who
you
say
is
my
son
until
very
recently
he
was
supposed
to
be
dead
rejoined
king
and
unfortunately
that
circumstance
led
my
wife
to
think
there
was
no
need
of
speaking
to
me
concerning
this
affair
at
the
time
of
our
marriage
but
we
now
have
reason
to
think
he
may
be
living
and
that
is
why
i
have
particularly
felt
it
my
duty
to
make
this
unpleasant
revelation
after
repeating
tulee
story
he
said
you
probably
have
not
forgotten
that
last
winter
two
slaves
escaped
to
boston
in
your
ship
king
cotton
the
old
merchant
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
try
not
to
be
agitated
said
king
if
we
keep
calm
and
assist
each
other
we
may
perhaps
extricate
ourselves
from
this
disagreeable
dilemma
without
any
very
disastrous
results
i
have
but
one
reason
for
thinking
it
possible
there
may
be
some
connection
between
the
lost
babe
and
one
of
the
slaves
whom
you
sent
back
to
his
claimant
the
two
babes
were
very
nearly
of
an
age
and
so
much
alike
that
the
exchange
passed
unnoticed
and
the
captain
of
king
cotton
told
gerald
that
the
eldest
of
those
slaves
resembled
him
so
much
that
he
should
not
know
them
apart
bell
covered
his
face
and
uttered
a
deep
groan
such
distress
in
an
old
man
powerfully
excited
king
sympathy
and
moving
near
to
him
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
and
said
do
be
so
much
troubled
sir
this
is
a
bad
affair
but
i
think
it
can
be
so
managed
as
to
do
no
very
serious
harm
my
motive
in
coming
to
you
at
this
time
is
to
ascertain
whether
you
can
furnish
me
with
any
clew
to
that
young
man
i
will
myself
go
in
search
of
him
and
i
will
take
him
to
europe
and
have
him
educated
in
a
manner
suitable
to
his
condition
as
your
descendant
and
the
heir
of
your
property
the
drawn
expression
of
the
old
merchant
mouth
was
something
painful
to
witness
it
seemed
as
if
every
nerve
was
pulled
to
its
utmost
tension
by
the
excitement
in
his
soul
he
obviously
had
to
make
a
strong
effort
to
speak
when
he
said
do
you
suppose
sir
that
a
merchant
of
my
standing
is
going
to
leave
his
property
to
negroes
you
forget
that
this
young
man
is
pure
replied
king
i
tell
you
sir
rejoined
bell
that
the
mulatto
who
was
with
him
was
his
wife
and
if
he
is
proved
to
be
my
grandson
i
never
see
him
nor
have
anything
to
do
with
him
unless
he
gives
her
up
not
if
you
educate
him
with
the
prince
royal
of
france
or
england
a
pretty
dilemma
you
have
placed
me
in
sir
my
property
it
seems
must
either
go
to
gerald
who
you
say
has
negro
blood
in
his
veins
or
to
this
other
fellow
who
is
a
slave
with
a
negro
wife
but
she
could
be
educated
in
europe
also
pleaded
king
and
i
could
establish
him
permanently
in
lucrative
business
abroad
by
this
arrangement
go
to
the
devil
with
your
arrangements
interrupted
the
merchant
losing
all
command
of
himself
if
you
expect
to
arrange
a
pack
of
mulatto
heirs
for
you
are
mistaken
sir
he
rose
up
and
struck
his
chair
upon
the
floor
with
a
vengeance
and
his
face
was
purple
with
rage
as
he
vociferated
i
have
legal
redress
for
this
sir
i
expose
your
wife
sir
i
lay
my
damages
at
a
million
sir
king
bowed
and
said
i
will
see
you
again
when
you
are
more
calm
as
he
went
out
he
heard
bell
striding
across
the
room
and
thrashing
the
furniture
about
poor
old
gentleman
thought
he
i
hope
i
shall
succeed
in
convincing
him
how
little
i
value
money
in
comparison
with
righting
this
wrong
as
far
as
possible
alas
it
would
never
have
taken
place
had
there
not
been
a
great
antecedent
wrong
and
that
again
grew
out
of
the
monstrous
evil
of
slavery
he
had
said
to
the
old
merchant
i
will
see
you
again
when
you
are
calmer
and
when
he
saw
him
again
he
was
indeed
calm
for
he
had
died
suddenly
of
a
fit
produced
by
violent
excitement
chapter
xxxv
a
few
weeks
after
the
funeral
of
bell
gerald
wrote
the
following
letter
to
king
my
honored
and
dear
friend
has
decided
to
go
to
europe
this
fall
that
i
may
have
certain
educational
advantages
which
she
has
planned
for
me
that
is
the
only
reason
she
assigns
but
she
is
evidently
nervous
about
your
investigations
and
i
think
a
wish
to
be
out
of
the
country
for
the
present
has
had
some
effect
in
producing
this
decision
i
have
not
sought
to
influence
her
concerning
this
or
the
other
important
point
you
wot
of
my
desire
is
to
conform
to
her
wishes
and
promote
her
happiness
in
any
way
she
chooses
this
it
is
my
duty
as
well
as
my
pleasure
to
do
she
intends
to
remain
in
europe
a
year
perhaps
longer
i
wish
very
much
to
see
you
all
and
eulalia
might
well
consider
me
a
very
impolite
acquaintance
if
i
should
go
without
saying
good
by
if
you
do
not
return
to
boston
before
we
sail
i
will
with
your
permission
make
a
short
call
upon
you
in
northampton
i
thank
for
her
likeness
it
will
be
very
precious
to
me
i
wish
you
would
add
your
own
and
another
for
wherever
my
lot
may
be
cast
you
three
will
always
be
among
my
dearest
memories
i
am
glad
of
this
arrangement
said
king
at
their
age
i
hope
a
year
of
separation
will
prove
sufficient
the
covered
the
wound
in
her
heart
and
answered
yes
it
is
best
but
the
constrained
tone
of
the
letter
pained
her
and
excited
her
mind
to
that
most
unsatisfactory
of
all
occupations
the
thinking
over
what
might
have
been
she
had
visions
of
her
son
as
he
lay
by
her
side
a
few
hours
before
chloe
carried
him
away
from
her
sight
and
then
there
rose
before
her
the
fair
face
of
that
other
son
whose
pretty
little
body
was
passing
into
the
roses
of
provence
both
of
them
had
gone
out
of
her
life
of
one
she
received
no
tidings
from
the
mysterious
world
of
spirits
while
the
other
was
walking
within
her
vision
as
a
shadow
the
reality
of
which
was
intangible
king
returned
to
boston
with
his
family
in
season
for
gerald
to
make
the
proposed
call
before
he
sailed
there
was
a
little
heightening
of
color
when
he
and
eulalia
met
but
he
had
drilled
himself
to
perform
the
part
of
a
polite
acquaintance
and
as
she
thought
she
had
been
rather
negligently
treated
of
late
she
was
cased
in
the
armor
of
maidenly
reserve
both
and
king
felt
it
to
be
an
arduous
duty
to
call
on
fitzgerald
that
lady
though
she
respected
their
conscientiousness
could
not
help
disliking
them
they
had
disturbed
her
relations
with
gerald
by
suggesting
the
idea
of
another
claim
upon
his
affections
and
they
had
offended
her
pride
by
introducing
the
vulgar
phantom
of
a
slave
son
to
haunt
her
imagination
she
was
continually
jealous
of
king
so
jealous
that
gerald
never
ventured
to
show
her
the
likeness
of
his
but
though
the
discerning
eyes
of
and
king
read
this
in
the
very
excess
of
her
polite
demonstrations
other
visitors
who
were
present
when
they
called
supposed
them
to
be
her
dearest
friends
and
envied
her
the
distinguished
intimacy
such
formal
attempts
at
intercourse
only
increased
the
cravings
of
rosa
heart
and
king
requested
gerald
to
grant
her
a
private
interview
inexpressibly
precious
were
these
few
stolen
moments
when
she
could
venture
to
call
him
son
and
hear
him
call
her
mother
he
brought
her
an
enamelled
locket
containing
some
of
his
hair
inscribed
with
the
word
gerald
and
she
told
him
that
to
the
day
of
her
death
she
would
always
wear
it
next
her
heart
he
opened
a
small
morocco
case
on
the
velvet
lining
of
which
lay
a
lily
of
delicate
silver
filigree
here
is
a
little
souvenir
for
eulalia
said
he
her
eyes
moistened
as
she
replied
i
fear
it
would
not
be
prudent
my
son
he
averted
his
face
as
he
answered
then
give
it
to
her
in
my
mother
name
it
will
be
pleasant
to
me
to
think
that
my
sister
is
wearing
it
a
few
days
after
gerald
had
sailed
for
europe
king
started
for
new
orleans
taking
with
him
his
wife
and
daughter
an
auctioneer
was
found
who
said
he
had
sold
to
a
gentleman
in
natchez
a
runaway
slave
named
bob
bruteman
who
strongly
resembled
the
likeness
of
gerald
they
proceeded
to
natchez
and
had
an
interview
with
the
purchaser
who
recognized
a
likeness
between
his
slave
bob
and
the
picture
of
gerald
he
said
he
had
made
a
bad
bargain
of
it
for
the
fellow
was
intelligent
and
artful
and
had
escaped
from
him
two
months
ago
in
answer
to
his
queries
king
stated
that
if
bob
was
the
one
he
supposed
he
was
a
white
man
and
had
friends
who
wished
to
redeem
him
but
as
the
master
had
obtained
no
clew
to
the
runaway
he
could
of
course
give
none
so
their
long
journey
produced
no
result
except
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
the
object
of
their
interest
had
escaped
from
slavery
it
had
been
their
intention
to
spend
the
coldest
months
at
the
south
but
a
volcano
had
flared
up
all
of
a
sudden
at
harper
ferry
and
boiling
lava
was
rolling
all
over
the
land
every
northern
man
who
visited
the
south
was
eyed
suspiciously
as
a
possible
emissary
of
john
brown
and
the
fact
that
king
was
seeking
to
redeem
a
runaway
slave
was
far
from
increasing
confidence
in
him
finding
that
silence
was
unsatisfactory
and
that
he
must
either
indorse
slavery
or
be
liable
to
perpetual
provocations
to
quarrel
he
wrote
to
blumenthal
to
have
their
house
in
readiness
for
their
return
an
arrangement
which
flora
and
her
children
hailed
with
merry
shouts
and
clapping
of
hands
when
they
arrived
they
found
their
house
as
warm
as
june
with
flora
and
her
family
there
to
receive
them
backed
by
a
small
army
of
servants
consisting
of
tulee
with
her
tall
son
and
daughter
and
little
benny
and
tom
and
chloe
all
of
whom
had
places
provided
for
them
either
in
the
household
or
in
king
commercial
establishment
their
tropical
exuberance
of
welcome
made
him
smile
when
the
hearty
were
over
he
said
to
his
wife
as
they
passed
into
the
parlor
it
really
seemed
as
if
we
were
landing
on
the
coast
of
guinea
with
a
cargo
of
beads
o
alfred
rejoined
she
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
for
employing
them
all
you
do
know
and
never
know
how
i
feel
toward
these
dusky
friends
for
you
never
had
them
watch
over
you
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
patiently
and
tenderly
leading
you
up
from
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
he
pressed
her
hand
affectionately
and
said
inasmuch
as
they
did
it
for
you
darling
they
did
it
for
me
this
sentiment
was
wrought
into
their
daily
deportment
to
their
servants
and
the
result
was
an
harmonious
relation
between
employer
and
employed
which
it
was
beautiful
to
witness
but
there
are
skeletons
hidden
away
in
the
happiest
households
king
had
hers
and
tom
and
chloe
had
theirs
the
death
of
bell
and
the
absence
of
fitzgerald
left
no
one
in
boston
who
would
be
likely
to
recognize
them
but
they
knew
that
the
fugitive
slave
act
was
still
in
force
and
though
they
relied
upon
king
generosity
in
case
of
emergency
they
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
not
being
free
it
was
not
so
with
tulee
she
had
got
beyond
mount
pisgah
into
the
canaan
of
freedom
and
her
happiness
was
unalloyed
king
though
kind
and
liberal
to
all
regarded
her
with
especial
favor
on
account
of
old
associations
the
golden
hoops
had
been
taken
from
her
ears
when
she
was
in
the
calaboose
but
he
had
presented
her
with
another
pair
for
he
liked
to
have
her
look
as
she
did
when
she
opened
for
him
that
door
in
new
orleans
which
had
proved
an
entrance
to
the
temple
and
palace
of
his
life
she
felt
herself
to
be
a
sort
of
prime
minister
in
the
small
kingdom
and
began
to
deport
herself
as
one
having
authority
no
empress
ever
had
more
satisfaction
in
a
royal
heir
than
she
had
in
watching
her
benny
trudging
to
school
with
his
slung
over
his
shoulder
in
a
green
satchel
king
had
made
for
him
the
stylishness
of
the
establishment
was
also
a
great
source
of
pride
to
her
and
she
often
remarked
in
the
kitchen
that
she
had
always
said
gold
was
none
too
good
for
missy
rosy
to
walk
upon
apart
from
this
consideration
she
herself
had
an
oriental
delight
in
things
that
were
lustrous
and
gayly
colored
tom
had
learned
to
read
quite
fluently
and
was
accustomed
to
edify
his
household
companions
with
chapters
from
the
bible
on
sunday
evenings
the
descriptions
of
king
splendor
made
a
lively
impression
on
tulee
mind
when
she
dusted
the
spacious
parlors
she
looked
admiringly
at
the
large
mirrors
the
gilded
circles
of
gas
lights
and
the
great
pictures
framed
in
crimson
and
gold
and
thought
that
the
temple
of
solomon
could
not
have
been
more
grand
she
could
scarcely
believe
delano
was
wealthy
a
beautiful
lady
said
she
to
flora
but
if
she
got
plenty
money
what
makes
her
dress
so
innocent
and
dull
there
missy
rosy
now
when
dressed
for
company
she
looks
like
the
queen
of
shebee
one
morning
tulee
awoke
to
look
out
upon
a
scene
entirely
new
to
her
southern
eyes
and
far
surpassing
anything
she
had
imagined
of
the
splendor
of
solomon
temple
on
the
evening
previous
the
air
had
been
full
of
mist
which
as
it
grew
colder
had
settled
on
the
trees
of
the
common
covering
every
little
twig
with
a
panoply
of
ice
a
very
light
snow
had
fallen
softly
during
the
night
and
sprinkled
the
ice
with
a
feathery
fleece
the
trees
in
this
delicate
white
vesture
standing
up
against
a
dark
blue
sky
looked
like
the
glorified
spirits
of
trees
here
and
there
the
sun
touched
them
and
dropped
a
shower
of
diamonds
tulee
gazed
a
moment
in
delighted
astonishment
and
ran
to
call
chloe

exclaimed
they
looks
like
great
white
angels
and
ise
feared
they
fly
away

was
very
impatient
for
the
sound
of
king
bell
and
as
soon
as
the
first
tinkle
was
heard
she
rushed
into
her
exclaiming
o
do
come
to
the
window
missy
rosy
sure
this
is
silver
land
rosa
was
no
less
surprised
when
she
looked
out
upon
that
wonderful
vision
of
the
earth
in
its
transfigured
raiment
of
why
tulee
said
she
it
is
diamond
land
i
seen
splendid
fairy
scenes
in
the
theatres
of
paris
but
never
anything
so
brilliant
as
this
i
used
to
think
the
woods
down
south
all
covered

the
beautifullest
thing

but
lors
missy

this
is
as
much
handsomer

solomon
temple
was
handsomer
than
a
but
neither
the
indoor
nor
the
outdoor
splendor
nor
all
the
personal
comforts
they
enjoyed
made
this
favored
band
of
colored
people
forgetful
of
the
brethren
they
had
left
in
bondage
every
word
about
john

was
sought
for

with
avidity
when

the
prisoner
was
not
supernaturally
delivered
they
did
not
relinquish
the
hope
till
the
of
december
and
when
that
sad
day
arrived
they
assembled
in
their
to
watch
and
pray
all
was
silent
except
now
and
then
an
occasional
groan
till
the
hands
of
the
clock
pointed
to
the
moment
of
the
martyr
exit
from
this
world
then
tom
poured
forth
his
soul
in
a
mighty
voice
of
prayer
ending
with
the
agonized
entreaty
o
lord
thou
hast
taken
away
our
moses
raise
us
up
a
joshua
and
all
cried
amen
chloe
who
had
faith
that
could
walk
the
stormiest
waves
spoke
words
of
fervent
cheer
to
the
weeping
congregation
i
tell
ye
they
killed
old
john
brown
said
she
they
kill
him
the
angel
that
opened
the
prison
doors
for
peter
has
let
him
out
and
sent
him
abroad
in
a
different
way
from
what
we
that
all
chapter
xxxvi
through
the
following
year
the
political
sky
grew
ever
darker
with
impending
clouds
crinkled
with
lightning
and
vocal
with
growlings
of
approaching
thunder
the
north
continued
to
make
servile
concessions
which
history
will
blush
to
record
but
they
proved
unavailing
the
arrogance
of
slaveholders
grew
by
what
it
fed
on
though
a
conscientious
wish
to
avoid
civil
war
mingled
largely
with
the
selfishness
of
trade
and
the
heartless
gambling
of
politicians
all
was
alike
interpreted
by
them
as
signs
of
northern
cowardice
at
last
the
sumter
gun
was
heard
booming
through
the
gathering
storm
instantly
the
air
was
full
of
starry
banners
and
northern
pavements
resounded
with
the
tramp
of
horse
and
the
rolling
of
artillery
wagons
a
thrill
of
patriotic
enthusiasm
kindled
the
souls
of
men
no
more
sending
back
of
slaves
all
our
cities
became
at
once
cities
of
refuge
for
men
had
risen
above
the
letter
of
the
constitution
into
the
spirit
of
the
declaration
of
independence
gerald
and
his
arrived
in
new
york
to
find
the
social
atmosphere
all
aglow
under
its
exciting
influence
he
wrote
to
king
yesterday
i
informed
you
of
our
arrival
and
now
i
write
to
tell
you
that
they
are
forming
a
regiment
here
to
march
to
the
defence
of
washington
and
i
have
joined
it
was
unwilling
at
first
but
a
fine
set
of
fellows
are
joining
all
young
gentlemen
i
told
she
would
be
ashamed
to
have
me
loiter
behind
the
sons
of
her
acquaintance
and
that
seward
said
it
was
only
an
affair
of
sixty
days
so
she
has
consented
i
enclose
a
letter
to
to
ask
her
blessing
on
my
enterprise
which
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
have
together
with
your
own
thus
with
the
unreflecting
exhilaration
of
youth
gerald
went
forth
to
the
war
as
light
of
heart
as
if
he
had
been
joining
a
or
a
hunting
excursion
so
little
did
he
comprehend
that
ferocious
system
of
despotism
which
was
fastening
its
fangs
on
free
institutions
with
the
of
a
bloodhound
for
the
next
two
months
his
letters
though
hurried
were
frequent
and
always
cheerful
mostly
filled
with
trifling
gossipings
about
and
affectionate
remembrances
to
those
he
had
left
behind
at
last
king
received
one
of
graver
import
which
ran
thus
i
have
met
with
a
strange
adventure
a
number
of
us
were
on
picket
duty
with
orders
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
we
went
pacing
back
and
forth
on
our
allotted
ground
now
passing
under
the
shadow
of
trees
now
coming
out
into
the
moonlight
i
walked
very
erect
feeling
myself
every
inch
a
soldier
sometimes
i
cast
scrutinizing
glances
into
groups
of
shrubbery
and
sometimes
i
gazed
absently
on
the
sparkling
potomac
while
memory
was
retracing
the
events
of
my
life
and
recalling
the
dear
ones
connected
with
them
just
as
i
reached
a
large
tree
which
formed
the
boundary
of
my
prescribed
course
the
next
sentinel
whose
walk
began
where
mine
ended
approached
the
same
tree
and
before
he
turned
again
we
met
face
to
face
for
an
instant
i
started
and
i
confess
to
a
momentary
feeling
of
superstition
for
i
thought
i
had
seen
myself
and
that
you
know
is
said
to
be
a
warning
of
approaching
death
he
could
not
have
seen
me
very
plainly
for
i
was
in
shadow
while
he
for
an
instant
was
clearly
revealed
by
the
moonlight
anxious
to
be
sure
whether
i
had
seen
a
vision
or
a
reality
when
i
again
approached
the
tree
i
waited
for
him
and
a
second
time
i
saw
such
a
likeness
of
myself
as
i
never
saw
excepting
in
the
mirror
he
turned
quickly
and
marched
away
with
military
promptitude
and
precision
i
watched
him
for
a
moment
as
his
erect
figure
alternately
dipped
into
shadow
and
emerged
into
light
i
need
not
tell
you
what
i
was
thinking
of
while
i
looked
for
you
can
easily
conjecture
the
third
time
we
met
i
said
is
your
name
he
replied
falkner
and
marched
away
i
write
on
a
drumhead
in
a
hurry
as
soon
as
i
can
obtain
a
talk
with
this
duplicate
of
myself
i
will
write
to
you
again
but
i
shall
not
mention
my
adventure
to
it
would
only
make
her
unhappy
another
letter
which
arrived
a
week
after
contained
merely
the
following
paragraph
on
the
subject
that
interested
them
most
we
soldiers
can
not
command
our
own
movements
or
our
time
i
have
been
able
to
see
but
once
and
then
our
interview
was
brief
he
seemed
very
reserved
about
himself
he
says
he
came
from
new
york
but
his
speech
is
southern
he
talks
about
things
and
says
he
i
shall
try
to
gain
his
confidence
and
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
draw
him
out
a
fortnight
later
he
wrote
i
have
learned
from
that
the
first
thing
he
remembers
of
himself
is
living
with
an
old
negress
about
ten
miles
from
new
orleans
with
eight
other
children
of
various
shades
but
none
so
white
as
himself
he
judges
he
was
about
nine
years
old
when
he
was
carried
to
new
orleans
and
let
out
by
a
rich
man
named
bruteman
to
a
to
black
boots
do
errands
one
of
the
children
that
the
old
negress
brought
up
with
him
was
a
mulatto
named
henriet
the
boys
called
her
hen
he
said
he
used
to
her
about
when
she
was
a
baby
and
afterward
they
used
to
roll
in
the
mud
and
make
together
when
hen
was
twelve
years
old
she
was
let
out
to
work
in
the
same
hotel
where
he
was
soon
afterward
bruteman
put
him
out
to
learn
the
carpenter
trade
and
he
soon
became
expert
at
it
but
though
he
earned
five
or
six
dollars
a
week
and
finally
nine
or
ten
he
never
received
any
portion
of
it
except
that
now
and
then
bruteman
when
he
counted
his
wages
gave
him
a
fip
i
never
thought
of
side
of
the
question
when
i
used
to
hear
grandfather
talk
about
the
rights
of
slaveholders
but
i
feel
now
if
this
had
been
my
own
case
i
should
have
thought
it
confounded
hard
he
and
hen
were
very
young
when
they
first
begun
to
talk
about
being
married
but
he
could
bear
the
thoughts
of
bringing
up
a
family
to
be
slaves
and
they
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
run
away
after
several
plans
which
proved
abortive
they
went
boldly
on
board
king
cotton
he
as
a
white
gentleman
and
she
disguised
as
his
boy
servant
you
know
how
that
attempt
resulted
he
says
they
were
kept
two
days
with
hands
and
feet
tied
on
an
island
that
was
nothing
but
rock
they
suffered
with
cold
though
one
of
the
sailors
who
seemed
covered
them
with
blankets
and
overcoats
he
probably
did
not
like
the
business
of
guarding
slaves
for
one
night
he
whispered
to
you
swim
but
george
was
very
little
used
to
the
water
and
hen
could
swim
at
all
besides
he
said
the
sailors
had
loaded
guns
and
some
of
them
would
have
fired
upon
them
if
they
had
heard
them
plunge
and
even
if
by
a
miracle
they
had
gained
the
shore
he
thought
they
would
be
seized
and
sent
back
again
just
as
they
were
in
boston
you
may
judge
how
i
felt
while
i
listened
to
this
i
wanted
to
ask
his
forgiveness
and
give
him
all
my
money
and
my
watch
and
my
ring
and
everything
after
they
were
carried
back
hen
was
sold
to
the
for
six
hundred
dollars
and
he
was
sold
to
a
man
in
natchez
for
fifteen
hundred
after
a
while
he
escaped
in
a
dress
contrived
to
open
a
communication
with
hen
and
succeeded
in
carrying
her
off
to
new
york
there
he
changed
his
woman
dress
and
his
slave
name
of
bob
bruteman
and
called
himself
george
falkner
when
i
asked
him
why
he
chose
that
name
he
rolled
up
his
sleeve
and
showed
me
marked
on
his
arm
he
said
he
did
know
who
put
them
there
but
he
supposed
they
were
the
initials
of
his
name
he
is
evidently
impressed
by
our
great
resemblance
if
he
asks
me
directly
whether
i
can
conjecture
anything
about
his
origin
i
hardly
know
how
it
will
be
best
to
answer
do
write
how
much
or
how
little
i
ought
to
say
feeling
unsafe
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
being
destitute
of
money
he
applied
to
the
abolitionists
for
advice
they
sent
him
to
new
rochelle
where
he
let
himself
to
a
quaker
called
friend
joseph
houseman
of
whom
he
hired
a
small
hut
there
hen
whom
he
now
calls
henriet
takes
in
washing
and
ironing
and
there
a
babe
has
been
born
to
them
when
the
war
broke
out
he
enlisted
partly
because
he
thought
it
would
help
him
to
pay
off
some
old
scores
with
slaveholders
and
partly
because
a
set
of
rowdies
in
the
village
of
new
rochelle
said
he
was
a
white
man
and
threatened
to
mob
him
for
living
with
a
nigger
wife
while
they
were
in
new
york
city
he
and
henriet
were
regularly
married
by
a
colored
minister
he
said
he
did
it
because
he
hated
slavery
and
could
bear
to
live
as
slaves
did
i
heard
him
read
a
few
lines
from
a
newspaper
and
he
read
them
pretty
well
he
says
a
little
boy
son
of
the
carpenter
of
whom
he
learned
his
trade
gave
him
some
instruction
and
he
bought
a
for
himself
he
showed
me
some
on
which
he
practises
writing
with
a
pencil
when
he
told
me
how
hard
he
had
tried
to
get
what
little
learning
he
had
it
made
me
ashamed
to
think
how
many
cakes
and
toys
i
received
as
a
reward
for
studying
my
he
is
teaching
an
old
negro
who
waits
upon
the
soldiers
it
is
funny
to
see
how
hard
the
poor
old
fellow
tries
and
to
hear
what
strange
work
he
makes
of
it
it
must
be
stolen
waters
are
sweet
or
slaves
would
never
take
so
much
more
pains
than
i
was
ever
willing
to
take
to
learn
to
spell
out
the
bible
sometimes
i
help
with
his
old
pupil
and
i
should
like
to
have
blumenthal
make
a
sketch
of
us
as
i
sit
on
the
grass
in
the
shade
of
some
tree
helping
the
old
negro
hammer
his
syllables
together
my
new
york
companions
laugh
at
me
sometimes
but
i
have
gained
great
favor
with
by
this
proceeding
he
is
such
an
ingenious
fellow
that
he
is
always
in
demand
to
make
or
mend
something
when
i
see
how
skilful
he
is
with
tools
i
envy
him
i
begin
to
realize
what
you
once
told
me
and
which
did
not
please
me
much
at
the
time
that
being
a
fine
gentleman
is
the
poorest
calling
a
man
can
devote
himself
to
i
have
written
this
long
letter
under
difficulties
and
at
various
times
i
have
omitted
many
particulars
which
i
will
try
to
remember
in
my
next
enclosed
is
a
note
for
i
hold
you
all
in
most
affectionate
remembrance
soon
after
the
reception
of
this
letter
news
came
of
the
defeat
at
bull
run
followed
by
tidings
that
gerald
was
among
the
slain
king
immediately
waited
upon
fitzgerald
to
offer
any
services
that
he
could
render
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
forthwith
proceed
to
washington
with
her
cousin
green
they
returned
with
a
long
wooden
box
on
which
was
inscribed
gerald
name
and
regiment
it
was
encased
in
black
walnut
without
being
opened
for
those
who
loved
him
dreaded
to
see
him
marred
as
he
was
by
battle
it
was
carried
to
stone
chapel
where
a
multitude
collected
to
pay
the
last
honors
to
the
youthful
soldier
a
sheathed
sword
was
laid
across
the
coffin
on
which
fitzgerald
placed
a
laurel
wreath
just
above
it
king
deposited
a
wreath
of
white
roses
in
the
centre
of
which
eulalia
timidly
laid
a
white
lily
a
long
procession
followed
it
to
mount
auburn
with
a
band
playing
beethoven
funeral
march
episcopal
services
were
performed
at
the
grave
which
friends
and
relatives
filled
with
flowers
and
there
by
the
side
of
bell
the
beautiful
young
man
was
hidden
away
from
human
sight
king
carriage
had
followed
next
to
fitzgerald
a
circumstance
which
the
public
explained
by
a
report
that
the
deceased
was
to
have
married
his
daughter
fitzgerald
felt
flattered
to
have
it
so
understood
and
she
never
contradicted
it
after
her
great
disappointment
in
her
husband
and
the
loss
of
her
other
children
all
the
affection
she
was
capable
of
feeling
had
centred
in
gerald
but
hers
was
not
a
deep
nature
and
the
world
held
great
sway
over
it
she
suffered
acutely
when
she
first
heard
of
her
loss
but
she
found
no
small
degree
of
soothing
compensation
in
the
praises
bestowed
on
her
young
hero
in
the
pomp
of
his
funeral
and
the
general
understanding
that
he
was
betrothed
to
the
daughter
of
the
the
depth
of
king
sorrow
was
known
only
to
him
who
made
the
heart
she
endeavored
to
conceal
it
as
far
as
possible
for
she
felt
it
to
be
wrong
to
cast
a
shadow
over
the
home
of
her
husband
and
daughter
gerald
likeness
was
placed
in
her
chamber
where
she
saw
it
with
the
first
morning
light
but
what
were
her
reveries
while
she
gazed
upon
it
was
told
to
no
one
custom
as
well
as
sincere
sympathy
made
it
necessary
for
her
to
make
a
visit
of
condolence
to
fitzgerald
but
she
merely
took
her
hand
pressed
it
gently
and
said
may
god
comfort
you
may
god
comfort
you
also
replied
fitzgerald
returning
the
pressure
and
from
that
time
henceforth
the
name
of
gerald
was
never
mentioned
between
them
after
the
funeral
it
was
noticed
that
alfred
blumenthal
appeared
abstracted
as
if
continually
occupied
with
grave
thoughts
one
day
as
he
stood
leaning
against
the
window
gazing
on
the
stars
and
stripes
that
floated
across
the
street
he
turned
suddenly
and
exclaimed
it
is
wrong
to
be
staying
here
i
ought
to
be
fighting
for
that
flag
i
supply
poor
gerald
place
delano
who
had
been
watching
him
anxiously
rose
up
and
clasped
him
round
the
neck
with
stronger
emotion
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
manifest
you
go
my
son
she
said
he
laid
his
hand
very
gently
on
her
head
as
he
replied
dearest
mamita
you
always
taught
me
to
obey
the
voice
of
duty
and
surely
it
is
a
duty
to
help
in
rescuing
liberty
from
the
bloody
jaws
of
this
dragon
slavery
she
lingered
an
instant
on
his
breast
then
raising
her
tearful
face
she
silently
pressed
his
hand
while
she
looked
into
those
kind
and
honest
eyes
that
so
strongly
reminded
her
of
eyes
closed
long
ago
you
are
right
my
son
murmured
she
and
may
god
give
you
strength
turning
from
her
to
hide
the
swelling
of
his
own
heart
alfred
saw
his
mother
sobbing
on
his
father
bosom
dearest
mamma
said
he
heaven
knows
it
is
hard
for
me
do
not
make
it
harder
it
takes
the
manhood
out
of
him
to
see
you
weep
darling
said
blumenthal
be
a
brave
little
woman
and
cheerfully
give
your
dearest
and
best
for
the
country
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
fervently
kissing
alfred
hand
replied
i
will
may
god
bless
you
my
dear
my
only
son
his
father
clasped
the
other
hand
and
said
with
forced
calmness
you
are
right
alfred
god
bless
you
and
now
dear
flora
let
us
consecrate
our
young
hero
resolution
by
singing
the
battle
song
of
korner
she
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
delano
joined
in
with
her
weak
but
very
sweet
voice
while
they
sang
father
i
call
on
thee
but
when
they
came
to
the
last
verse
the
voices
choked
and
the
piano
became
silent
rosen
blumen
and
lila
came
in
and
found
them
all
weeping
and
when
their
brother
pressed
them
in
his
arms
and
whispered
to
them
the
cause
of
all
this
sorrow
they
cried
as
if
their
hearts
were
breaking
then
their
mother
summoned
all
her
resolution
and
became
a
comforter
while
their
father
talked
to
them
of
the
nobility
and
beauty
of
she
kissed
them
and
soothed
them
with
hopeful
words
then
turning
to
delano
she
tenderly
caressed
her
faded
hair
while
she
said
dearest
mamita
i
trust
god
will
restore
to
us
our
precious
boy
i
will
paint
his
picture
as
george
slaying
the
dragon
and
you
shall
hang
it
in
your
chamber
in
memory
of
what
he
said
to
you
alfred
unable
to
control
his
emotions
hid
himself
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
chamber
he
struck
his
hand
wildly
against
his
forehead
exclaiming
o
my
country
great
is
the
sacrifice
i
make
for
thee
then
kneeling
by
the
bed
where
he
had
had
so
many
peaceful
slumbers
and
dreamed
so
many
pleasant
dreams
he
prayed
fervently
that
god
would
give
him
strength
according
to
his
need
and
so
he
went
forth
from
his
happy
home
to
the
cause
of
freedom
the
women
now
had
but
one
absorbing
interest
and
occupation
all
were
eager
for
news
from
the
army
and
all
were
busy
working
for
the
soldiers
chapter
xxxvii
when
king
returned
from
his
mournful
journey
to
washington
he
said
to
his
wife
i
saw
george
falkner
and
was
pleased
with
him
his
resemblance
to
poor
gerald
is
wonderful
i
could
see
no
difference
except
a
firmer
expression
of
the
mouth
which
i
suppose
is
owing
to
his
determined
efforts
to
escape
from
slavery
of
course
he
has
not
gerald
gracefulness
but
his
bearing
seemed
manly
and
there
was
no
obvious
stamp
of
vulgarity
upon
him
it
struck
me
that
his
transformation
into
a
gentleman
would
be
an
easy
process
i
was
glad
our
interview
was
a
hurried
one
and
necessarily
taken
up
with
details
about
gerald
death
it
seems
he
carried
him
off
in
his
own
arms
when
he
was
wounded
and
that
he
did
his
utmost
to
stanch
the
blood
gerald
never
spoke
after
the
bullet
struck
him
though
he
pressed
his
hand
and
appeared
to
try
to
say
something
when
he
opened
his
vest
to
dress
the
wound
he
found
this
rosa
looked
at
it
groaned
out
poor
gerald
and
covered
her
face
it
was
the
photograph
of
eulalia
with
the
upper
part
shot
away
both
remained
for
some
time
with
their
heads
bowed
in
silence
after
a
while
king
resumed
in
answer
to
green
inquiries
concerning
the
mutilated
picture
i
replied
that
it
was
a
likeness
of
my
daughter
and
he
answered
that
he
had
heard
a
marriage
was
thought
of
between
them
i
was
glad
he
happened
to
say
that
for
it
will
make
it
seem
natural
to
george
that
i
should
take
a
lively
interest
in
him
on
gerald
account
the
funeral
and
alfred
departure
for
the
army
have
left
me
little
time
to
arrange
my
thoughts
on
that
subject
but
i
have
now
formed
definite
plans
that
i
propose
we
should
this
evening
talk
over
at
blumenthal
when
the
sisters
met
and
the
girls
had
gone
to
another
room
to
talk
over
their
lessons
and
imagine
what
alfred
was
then
doing
king
began
to
speak
of
george
falkner
rosa
said
my
first
wish
is
to
go
to
new
rochelle
and
bring
home
henriet
she
ought
to
be
educated
in
a
degree
somewhat
suitable
to
her
husband
prospects
i
will
teach
her
to
read
and
write
and
give
her
lessons
on
the
piano
i
think
that
would
prove
too
much
for
your
finely
attuned
musical
nerves
rejoined
her
husband
do
you
suppose
you
are
going
to
make
the
sacrifices
responded
she
smiling
it
is
at
all
like
you
to
wish
to
engross
everything
to
yourself
rosa
has
a
predilection
for
penance
remarked
flora
and
if
she
listens
daily
to
a
beginner
knocking
the
scales
up
hill
and
down
hill
i
think
it
will
answer
instead
of
walking
to
jerusalem
with
peas
in
her
shoes
before
i
mention
my
plans
i
should
like
to
hear
your
view
of
the
subject
blumenthal
said
king
his
replied
i
think
rosa
is
right
about
taking
charge
of
henriet
and
educating
her
but
it
seems
to
me
the
worst
thing
you
could
do
for
her
or
her
husband
would
be
to
let
them
know
that
they
have
a
claim
to
riches
sudden
wealth
is
apt
to
turn
the
heads
of
much
older
people
than
they
are
and
having
been
brought
up
as
slaves
their
danger
would
be
greatly
increased
if
henriet
could
be
employed
to
sew
for
you
she
might
be
gratified
with
easy
work
and
generous
wages
while
you
watched
over
her
morals
and
furnished
her
with
opportunities
to
improve
her
mind
if
george
survives
the
war
some
employment
with
a
comfortable
salary
might
be
provided
for
him
with
a
promise
to
advance
him
according
to
his
industry
and
general
good
habits
how
does
that
strike
you
mamita
i
agree
perfectly
with
you
rejoined
delano
i
think
it
would
be
far
more
prudent
to
have
their
characters
formed
by
habits
of
exertion
and
before
they
are
informed
that
they
are
rich
it
gratifies
me
to
have
my
own
judgment
thus
confirmed
said
king
you
have
given
the
outlines
of
a
plan
i
had
already
formed
but
this
judicious
process
must
not
of
course
deprive
the
young
man
of
a
single
cent
that
is
due
to
him
you
are
aware
that
bell
left
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
his
grandson
to
be
paid
when
he
was
years
of
age
i
have
already
invested
that
sum
for
george
and
placed
it
in
the
care
of
percival
with
directions
that
the
interest
shall
be
added
to
it
from
that
date
the
remainder
of
property
with
the
exception
of
some
legacies
was
unreservedly
left
to
his
daughter
i
have
taken
some
pains
to
ascertain
the
amount
and
i
shall
add
a
codicil
to
my
will
leaving
an
equal
sum
to
george
if
i
survive
fitzgerald
the
interest
on
it
will
date
from
her
decease
and
i
shall
take
the
best
legal
advice
as
to
the
means
of
securing
her
property
from
any
claims
by
george
or
his
heirs
after
they
are
informed
of
the
whole
story
as
they
will
be
whenever
fitzgerald
dies
you
are
rightly
named
royal
king
rejoined
blumenthal
you
do
things
in
such
princely
style
in
a
style
better
than
that
of
most
royal
kings
replied
he
for
it
is
simply
that
of
an
honest
man
if
this
entanglement
had
never
happened
i
should
have
done
as
much
for
gerald
and
let
me
do
what
i
will
eulalia
will
have
more
money
than
is
good
for
her
besides
i
rather
expect
this
arrangement
will
prove
a
benefit
to
myself
i
intend
to
employ
the
young
man
as
one
of
my
agents
in
europe
and
if
he
shows
as
much
enterprise
and
perseverance
in
business
as
he
did
in
escaping
from
slavery
he
will
prove
an
excellent
partner
for
me
when
increasing
years
diminish
my
own
energies
i
would
gladly
adopt
him
and
have
him
live
with
us
but
i
doubt
whether
such
a
great
and
sudden
change
of
condition
would
prove
salutary
and
his
having
a
colored
wife
would
put
obstructions
in
his
way
entirely
beyond
our
power
to
remove
but
the
strongest
objection
to
it
is
that
such
an
arrangement
would
greatly
annoy
fitzgerald
whose
happiness
we
are
bound
to
consult
in
every
possible
way
has
she
been
informed
that
the
young
man
is
found
inquired
delano
no
replied
king
it
occurred
very
near
the
time
of
death
and
we
deem
it
unkind
to
disturb
her
mind
about
it
for
some
months
to
come
the
next
week
and
king
started
for
new
york
and
thence
proceeded
to
new
rochelle
following
the
directions
they
had
received
they
hired
a
carriage
at
the
to
convey
them
to
a
a
few
miles
distant
as
they
approached
the
designated
place
they
saw
a
slender
man
in
clothes
lowering
a
bucket
into
the
well
king
alighted
and
inquired
is
this
houseman
farm
sir
my
name
is
joseph
houseman
replied
the
quaker
i
am
usually
called
friend
joseph
king
returned
to
the
carriage
and
saying
this
is
the
place
he
assisted
his
lady
to
alight
returning
to
the
farmer
he
said
we
have
come
to
ask
you
about
a
young
colored
woman
named
henriet
falkner
her
husband
rendered
service
to
a
dear
young
friend
of
ours
in
the
army
and
we
would
be
glad
to
repay
the
obligation
by
kindness
to
her
walk
in
said
the
quaker
he
showed
them
into
a
neat
plainly
furnished
parlor
where
art
thou
from
he
inquired
from
boston
was
the
reply
what
is
thy
name
mr
king
all
men
are
called
mister
rejoined
the
quaker
what
is
thy
given
name
my
name
is
alfred
royal
king
and
this
is
my
wife
rosa
king
hast
thou
brought
a
letter
from
the
woman
husband
inquired
friend
joseph
no
replied
king
i
saw
george
falkner
in
washington
a
fortnight
ago
when
i
went
to
seek
the
body
of
our
young
friend
but
i
did
not
then
think
of
coming
here
if
you
doubt
me
you
can
write
to
william
lloyd
garrison
or
wendell
phillips
and
inquire
of
them
whether
alfred
king
is
capable
of
deceiving
i
like
thy
countenance
friend
alfred
and
i
think
thou
art
honest
rejoined
the
quaker
but
where
colored
people
are
concerned
i
have
known
very
polite
and
men
to
tell
falsehoods
king
smiled
as
he
answered
i
commend
your
caution
friend
joseph
i
see
how
it
is
you
suspect
we
may
be
slaveholders
in
disguise
but
slaveholders
are
just
now
too
busy
seeking
to
destroy
this
republic
to
have
any
time
to
hunt
fugitives
and
when
they
have
more
leisure
my
opinion
is
they
will
find
that
occupation
gone
i
should
have
more
hope
of
that
replied
the
farmer
if
there
was
not
so
much
here
at
the
north
and
thee
knows
that
the
generals
of
the
united
states
are
continually
sending
back
fugitive
slaves
to
bleed
under
the
lash
of
their
taskmasters
i
honor
your
scruples
friend
joseph
responded
king
and
that
they
may
be
completely
removed
we
will
wait
at
the
metropolitan
in
new
york
until
you
have
received
letters
from
garrison
and
phillips
and
lest
you
should
think
i
may
have
assumed
the
name
of
another
i
will
give
you
these
to
enclose
in
your
letter
he
opened
his
and
took
out
two
photographs
i
shall
ask
to
have
them
sent
back
to
me
replied
the
farmer
for
i
should
like
to
keep
a
likeness
of
thee
and
thy
rosa
they
will
be
pleasant
to
look
upon
as
soon
as
i
receive
an
answer
friend
alfred
i
will
call
upon
thee
at
the
metropolitan
we
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you
friend
joseph
said
rosa
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
which
penetrated
the
quaker
soul
as
sunshine
does
the
receptive
earth
yet
when
the
carriage
had
rolled
away
he
harnessed
his
sleek
horses
to
the
wagon
and
conveyed
henriet
and
her
babe
to
the
house
of
a
friend
at
white
plains
till
he
ascertained
whether
these
strangers
were
what
they
professed
to
be
a
few
days
afterward
friend
joseph
called
at
the
metropolitan
when
he
inquired
for
the
wealthy
bostonian
the
waiter
stared
at
his
plain
dress
and
said
your
card
sir
i
have
no
card
replied
the
farmer
tell
him
friend
joseph
wishes
to
see
him
the
waiter
returned
saying
walk
this
way
sir
and
showed
him
into
the
elegant
as
he
sat
there
another
servant
passing
through
looked
at
him
and
said
all
gentlemen
take
off
their
hats
in
this
room
sir
that
may
be
quietly
replied
the
quaker
but
all
do
not
for
thee
sees
i
keep
mine
on
the
entrance
of
king
and
his
cordial
salutation
made
an
impression
on
the
waiters
minds
and
when
friend
joseph
departed
they
opened
the
door
very
obsequiously
the
result
of
the
conference
was
that
and
king
returned
to
boston
with
henriet
and
her
little
one
tulee
had
proved
in
many
ways
that
her
discretion
might
be
trusted
and
it
was
deemed
wisest
to
tell
her
the
whole
story
of
the
babe
who
had
been
carried
to
the
calaboose
with
her
when
bruteman
agent
seized
her
this
confidence
secured
her
as
a
firm
friend
and
ally
of
henriet
while
her
devoted
attachment
to
king
rendered
her
secrecy
certain
when
black
chloe
saw
the
newcomer
learning
to
play
on
the
piano
she
was
somewhat
jealous
because
the
same
privilege
had
not
been
offered
to
her
children
i
did
know
missy
rosy
tought
thar
war
sech
a
mighty
difference
black
an
brown
said
she
i
do
see
nothin
so
drefful
pooty
in
dat
ar
molasses
color
now
ye
shut
up
rejoined
tulee
missy
rosy
knows
what
she
ye
see
fitzgerald
was
in
love
with
missy
eulaly
an
husban
took
care
o
him
when
he
was
dying
king
is
going
to
send
him
the
water
on
some
gran
business
to
pay
him
for
and
missy
rosy
wants
his
wife
to
be
out
there
strangers
henriet
proved
and
unassuming
and
with
occasional
patronage
from
tulee
she
was
generally
able
to
keep
her
little
boat
in
smooth
water
when
she
had
been
there
a
few
months
king
enclosed
to
fitzgerald
the
letters
gerald
had
written
about
george
and
a
few
days
afterward
he
called
to
explain
fully
what
he
had
done
and
what
he
intended
to
do
that
lady
dislike
for
her
rival
was
much
diminished
since
there
was
no
gerald
to
excite
her
jealousy
of
divided
affection
there
was
some
perturbation
in
her
manner
but
she
received
her
visitor
with
great
politeness
and
when
he
had
finished
his
statement
she
said
i
have
great
respect
for
your
motives
and
your
conduct
and
i
am
satisfied
to
leave
everything
to
your
good
judgment
and
kind
feelings
i
have
but
one
request
to
make
it
is
that
this
young
man
may
never
know
he
is
my
son
your
wishes
shall
be
respected
replied
king
but
he
so
strongly
resembles
gerald
that
if
you
should
ever
visit
europe
again
you
might
perhaps
like
to
see
him
if
you
only
recognized
him
as
a
relative
of
your
husband
the
lady
face
flushed
as
she
answered
promptly
no
sir
i
shall
never
recognize
any
person
as
a
relative
who
has
a
colored
wife
much
as
i
loved
gerald
i
would
never
have
seen
him
again
if
he
had
formed
such
an
alliance
not
even
if
his
wife
were
the
most
beautiful
and
accomplished
creature
that
ever
walked
the
earth
you
are
treading
rather
closely
upon
fitzgerald
rejoined
king
smiling
the
lady
seemed
embarrassed
and
said
she
had
forgotten
origin
your
son
wife
is
not
so
far
removed
from
a
colored
ancestry
as
mine
is
rejoined
king
but
i
think
you
would
soon
forget
her
origin
also
if
you
were
in
a
country
where
others
did
not
think
of
it
i
believe
our
american
prejudice
against
color
is
one
of
what
carlyle
calls
phantom
dynasties
it
may
be
so
she
replied
coldly
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
convinced
of
it
and
king
bowed
good
morning
a
week
or
two
after
this
interview
fitzgerald
called
upon
king
for
after
all
she
felt
a
certain
sort
of
attraction
in
the
secret
history
that
existed
between
them
and
she
was
unwilling
to
have
the
world
suppose
her
acquaintance
had
been
dropped
by
so
distinguished
a
lady
by
inadvertence
of
the
servant
at
the
door
she
was
shown
into
the
parlor
while
henriet
was
there
with
her
child
on
the
floor
receiving
directions
concerning
some
muslin
flounces
she
was
embroidering
upon
the
entrance
of
a
visitor
she
turned
to
take
up
her
infant
and
depart
but
king
said
leave
little
hetty
here
falkner
till
you
bring
my
basket
for
me
to
select
the
floss
you
need
hetty
being
thus
left
alone
scrambled
up
and
toddled
toward
king
as
if
accustomed
to
an
affectionate
reception
the
black
curls
that
clustered
round
her
yellow
face
shook
as
her
uncertain
steps
hastened
to
a
place
of
refuge
and
when
she
leaned
against
her
friend
lap
a
pretty
smile
quivered
on
her
coral
lips
and
lighted
up
her
large
dark
eyes
fitzgerald
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
mixture
of
feelings
do
you
think
she
a
pretty
little
creature
asked
king
she
might
be
pretty
if
the
yellow
could
be
washed
off
replied
fitzgerald
her
cheeks
are
nearly
the
color
of
your
hair
rejoined
king
and
i
always
thought
that
beautiful
fitzgerald
glanced
at
the
mirror
and
sighed
as
she
said
ah
yes
my
hair
used
to
be
thought
very
pretty
when
i
was
young
but
i
can
see
that
it
begins
to
fade
when
henriet
returned
and
took
the
child
she
looked
at
her
very
curiously
she
was
thinking
to
herself
what
my
father
say
but
she
asked
no
questions
and
made
no
remark
she
had
joined
a
circle
of
ladies
who
were
sewing
and
knitting
for
the
soldiers
and
after
some
talk
about
the
difficulty
she
had
found
in
learning
to
knit
socks
and
how
fashionable
it
was
for
everybody
to
knit
now
she
rose
to
take
leave
chapter
xxxviii
the
months
passed
on
and
brought
demands
for
more
soldiers
king
watched
the
progress
of
the
struggle
with
the
deepest
anxiety
one
day
when
he
had
seen
a
new
regiment
depart
for
the
south
he
returned
home
in
a
still
more
serious
mood
than
was
now
habitual
to
him
after
supper
he
opened
the
evening
transcript
and
read
for
a
while
then
turning
to
his
wife
who
sat
near
him
knitting
for
the
army
he
said
dear
rosabella
during
all
the
happy
years
that
i
have
been
your
husband
you
have
never
failed
to
encourage
me
in
every
good
impulse
and
i
trust
you
will
strengthen
me
now
with
a
trembling
dread
of
what
was
coming
she
asked
what
is
it
dear
alfred
rosa
this
republic
be
saved
replied
he
with
solemn
emphasis
it
is
the
of
hope
to
the
toiling
masses
of
the
world
and
it
not
go
out
in
darkness
it
is
not
enough
for
me
to
help
with
money
i
ought
to
go
and
sustain
our
soldiers
by
cheering
words
and
a
brave
example
it
fills
me
with
shame
and
indignation
when
i
think
that
all
this
peril
has
been
brought
upon
us
by
that
foul
system
which
came
so
near
making
a
wreck
of
my
precious
one
as
it
has
wrecked
thousands
of
pure
and
gentle
souls
i
foresee
that
this
war
is
destined
by
mere
force
of
circumstances
to
rid
the
republic
of
that
deadly
incubus
rosa
are
you
not
willing
to
give
me
up
for
the
safety
of
the
country
and
the
freedom
of
your
mother
race
she
tried
to
speak
but
utterance
failed
her
after
a
struggle
with
herself
she
said
do
you
realize
how
hard
is
a
soldier
life
you
will
break
down
under
it
dear
alfred
for
you
have
been
educated
in
ease
and
luxury
my
education
is
not
finished
replied
he
smiling
as
he
looked
round
on
the
elegant
and
luxurious
apartment
what
are
all
these
comforts
and
splendors
compared
with
the
rescue
of
my
country
and
the
redemption
of
an
oppressed
race
what
is
my
life
compared
with
the
life
of
this
republic
say
dearest
that
you
will
give
me
willingly
to
this
righteous
cause
far
rather
would
i
give
my
own
life
she
said
but
i
will
never
seek
to
trammel
your
conscience
alfred
they
spoke
together
tenderly
of
the
past
and
hopefully
of
the
future
and
then
they
knelt
and
prayed
together
some
time
was
necessarily
spent
in
making
arrangements
for
the
comfort
and
safety
of
the
family
during
his
absence
and
when
those
were
completed
he
also
went
forth
to
rescue
liberty
from
the
jaws
of
the
devouring
dragon
when
he
bade
farewell
to
flora
family
he
said
look
after
my
precious
ones
blumenthal
and
if
i
never
return
see
to
it
that
percival
carries
out
all
my
plans
with
regard
to
george
falkner
eight
or
ten
weeks
later
alfred
blumenthal
was
lying
in
a
hospital
at
washington
dangerously
wounded
and
burning
with
fever
his
father
and
mother
and
delano
immediately
went
to
him
and
the
women
remained
until
the
trembling
balance
between
life
and
death
was
determined
in
his
favor
the
soldier
life
which
he
at
first
dreaded
had
become
familiar
to
him
and
he
found
a
terrible
sort
of
excitement
in
its
chances
and
dangers
delano
sighed
to
observe
that
the
gentle
expression
of
his
countenance
so
like
the
alfred
of
her
memory
was
changing
to
a
sterner
manhood
it
was
harder
than
the
first
parting
to
send
him
forth
again
into
the
fiery
hail
of
battle
but
they
put
strong
constraint
upon
themselves
and
tried
to
perform
bravely
their
part
in
the
great
drama
that
visit
to
his
suffering
but
uncomplaining
son
made
a
strong
impression
on
the
mind
of
blumenthal
he
became
abstracted
and
restless
one
evening
as
he
sat
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
flora
said
what
are
you
thinking
of
florimond
he
answered
i
am
thinking
dear
of
the
agony
i
suffered
when
i
had
money
to
save
you
from
the
and
i
am
thinking
how
the
same
accursed
system
is
striving
to
perpetuate
and
extend
itself
the
republic
has
need
of
all
her
sons
to
stop
its
ravages
and
i
feel
guilty
in
staying
here
while
our
alfred
is
so
heroically
offering
up
his
young
life
in
the
cause
of
freedom
i
have
dreaded
this
she
said
i
have
seen
for
days
that
it
was
coming
but
o
florimond
it
is
hard
she
hid
her
face
in
his
bosom
and
he
felt
her
heart
beat
violently
while
he
talked
concerning
the
dangers
and
duties
of
the
time
delano
bowed
her
head
over
the
soldier
sock
she
was
knitting
and
tears
dropped
on
it
while
she
listened
to
them
the
weight
that
lay
so
heavily
upon
their
souls
was
suddenly
lifted
up
for
a
time
by
the
entrance
of
joe
bright
he
came
in
with
a
radiant
face
and
bowing
all
round
said
i
come
to
bid
you
good
by
going
to
defend
the
old
flag
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
sang
is
the
banner
o
long
may
it
wave
flora
went
to
the
piano
and
accompanied
him
with
instrument
and
voice
her
husband
soon
struck
in
and
rosen
blumen
and
lila
left
their
lessons
to
perform
their
part
in
the
strain
when
they
had
sung
the
last
line
mr
bright
without
pausing
to
take
breath
struck
into
scots
wha
hae
wi
wallace
bled
and
they
followed
his
lead
he
put
on
all
his
steam
when
he
came
to
the
verse
by
our
country
woes
and
pains
by
our
sons
in
servile
chains
we
will
drain
our
dearest
veins
but
they
be
free
he
emphasized
the
word
and
brought
his
clenched
hand
down
upon
the
table
so
forcibly
that
the
shade
over
the
shook
in
the
midst
of
it
delano
stole
out
of
the
room
she
had
a
great
respect
and
liking
for
mr
bright
but
he
was
sometimes
rather
too
demonstrative
to
suit
her
taste
he
was
too
much
carried
away
with
enthusiasm
to
notice
her
noiseless
retreat
and
he
went
on
to
the
conclusion
of
his
song
with
unabated
energy
all
earnestness
is
magnetic
and
blumenthal
and
even
the
children
caught
his
spirit
when
the
song
ended
blumenthal
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
one
needs
strong
lungs
to
accompany
you
mr
bright
you
sang
that
like
the
tramp
of
a
regiment
and
you
blazed
away
like
an
explosion
of
artillery
rejoined
he
the
fact
is
replied
blumenthal
the
war
spirit
pervades
the
air
and
i
caught
it
i
going
to
join
the
army
are
you
exclaimed
mr
bright
seizing
his
hand
with
so
tight
a
grip
that
it
made
him
wince
i
hope
you
be
my
captain
blumenthal
rubbed
his
hand
and
smiled
as
he
said
i
pity
the
rebel
that
you
get
hold
of
mr
bright
ask
your
pardon
ask
your
pardon
rejoined
he
but
speaking
of
the
tramp
of
a
regiment
here
it
goes
and
he
struck
up
john
hallelujah
they
put
their
souls
into
it
in
such
a
manner
that
the
spirit
of
the
brave
old
martyr
seemed
marching
all
through
it
when
it
came
to
a
conclusion
mr
bright
remarked
only
to
think
how
that
incendiary
song
is
sung
in
boston
streets
and
in
the
parlors
too
when
only
little
more
than
a
year
ago
a
great
mob
was
yelling
after
wendell
phillips
for
speaking
on
the
anniversary
of
john
brown
execution
i
said
then
the
fools
would
get
enough
of
slavery
before
they
done
with
it
and
i
reckon
they
beginning
to
find
it
out
not
only
the
rowdies
but
the
nabobs
that
set
on
war
a
blessing
but
it
a
mighty
great
teacher
that
a
fact
no
wonder
the
slavites
hated
phillips
he
aims
sure
and
hits
hard
no
use
in
trying
to
pass
off
shams
upon
if
you
bring
him
anything
that
ai
real
mahogany
his
blows
be
sure
to
make
the
veneering
fly
but
i
staying
too
long
i
only
looked
in
to
tell
you
i
was
going
he
glanced
round
for
delano
and
added
i
afraid
i
sung
too
loud
for
that
quiet
lady
the
fact
is
i
full
of
fight
that
what
the
times
demand
replied
blumenthal
they
bade
him
good
night
and
smiled
at
each
other
to
hear
his
strong
voice
as
it
receded
in
the
distance
still
singing
his
soul
is
marching
on
now
i
will
go
to
mamita
said
flora
her
gentle
spirit
suffers
in
these
days
this
morning
when
she
saw
a
company
of
soldiers
marching
by
and
heard
the
boys
hurrahing
she
said
to
me
so
piteously
flora
these
are
wild
times
poor
mamita
she
like
a
dove
in
a
tornado
seemed
to
be
strong
as
an
eagle
while
you
were
singing
responded
her
husband
i
felt
like
a
drenched
when
mr
bright
came
in
rejoined
she
but
he
and
the
music
together
lifted
me
up
into
the
blue
as
your
germans
say
and
from
that
height
can
you
say
to
me
the
call
of
duty
florimond
she
put
her
little
hand
in
his
and
answered
i
can
may
god
protect
us
all
then
turning
to
her
children
she
said
i
am
going
to
bring
mamita
and
presently
when
i
go
away
to
be
alone
with
papa
a
little
while
i
want
you
to
do
everything
to
make
the
evening
pleasant
for
mamita
you
know
she
likes
to
hear
you
sing
phoebus
sinketh
in
the
west
and
i
will
play
that
nocturne
of
mendelssohn
that
she
likes
so
much
replied
rosen
blumen
she
says
i
play
it
almost
as
well
as
aunt
rosa
and
she
likes
to
hear
me
sing
on
a
time
there
was
a
king
said
lila
she
says
she
heard
singing
it
in
the
woods
a
long
time
ago
when
she
had
anybody
to
call
her
mamita
very
well
my
children
replied
their
mother
do
everything
you
can
to
make
mamita
happy
for
there
will
never
be
such
another
mamita
during
the
anxious
months
that
followed
blumenthal
departure
the
sisters
and
their
families
were
almost
daily
at
the
rooms
of
the
sanitary
commission
sewing
packing
or
writing
henriet
had
become
expert
with
the
and
was
very
efficient
help
and
even
tulee
though
far
from
skilful
with
her
needle
contrived
to
make
dozens
of
hospital
slippers
which
it
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
to
deliver
to
the
ladies
of
the
commission
chloe
added
her
quota
of
socks
often
elephantine
in
shape
and
sometimes
oddly
decorated
with
red
tops
and
toes
but
with
a
blessing
for
the
boys
in
blue
running
through
all
the
threads
there
is
no
need
to
say
how
eagerly
they
watched
for
letters
and
what
a
relief
it
was
to
recognize
the
writing
of
beloved
hands
feeling
each
time
that
it
might
be
the
last
king
kept
up
occasional
correspondence
with
the
officers
of
george
falkner
company
and
sent
from
time
to
time
favorable
reports
of
his
bravery
and
good
habits
henriet
received
frequent
letters
from
him
imperfectly
spelled
but
full
of
love
and
loyalty
two
years
after
king
left
his
happy
home
he
was
brought
back
with
a
colonel
but
with
his
right
leg
gone
and
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
when
the
first
joy
of
reunion
had
expressed
itself
in
caresses
and
affectionate
words
he
said
to
rosa
you
see
what
a
cripple
you
have
for
a
husband
i
make
the
same
reply
the
english
girl
did
to
commodore
barclay
she
replied
dear
as
ever
to
me
so
long
as
there
body
enough
to
hold
the
soul
eulalia
wept
tears
of
joy
on
her
father
neck
while
flora
and
rosen
blumen
and
lila
clasped
their
arms
round
him
and
tulee
stood
peeping
in
at
the
door
waiting
for
her
turn
to
welcome
the
hero
home
flora
you
see
my
dancing
days
are
over
said
the
colonel
never
mind
i
do
your
dancing
she
replied
rosen
blumen
play
uncle
favorite
waltz
she
passed
her
arm
round
eulalia
and
for
a
few
moments
they
revolved
round
the
room
to
the
circling
music
she
had
so
long
been
called
the
life
of
the
family
that
she
tried
to
keep
up
her
claim
to
the
title
but
her
present
mirthfulness
was
assumed
and
it
was
contrary
to
her
nature
to
act
a
part
she
kissed
her
hand
to
her
and
smiled
as
she
whirled
out
of
the
room
but
she
ran
up
stairs
and
pressed
the
tears
back
as
she
murmured
to
herself
ah
if
i
could
only
be
sure
florimond
and
alfred
would
come
back
even
mutilated
as
he
is
chapter
xxxix
another
year
brought
with
it
what
was
supposed
to
be
peace
and
the
army
was
disbanded
husband
and
son
returned
alive
and
well
and
flora
was
her
young
self
again
in
the
exuberance
of
her
joy
she
seemed
more
juvenile
than
her
girls
jumping
from
husband
to
son
and
from
son
to
husband
kissing
them
and
calling
them
all
manner
of
pet
names
embracing
delano
at
intervals
and
exclaiming
o
mamita
here
we
are
all
together
again
i
wish
my
arms
were
long
enough
to
hug
you
all
at
once
i
thank
god
my
child
for
your
sake
and
for
my
own
replied
delano
she
looked
at
alfred
as
she
spoke
and
the
affectionate
glance
he
returned
filled
her
heart
with
a
deep
and
quiet
joy
the
stern
shadow
of
war
vanished
from
his
face
in
the
sunshine
of
home
and
she
recognized
the
same
gentle
expression
that
had
been
photographed
on
her
memory
long
years
ago
when
the
family
from
beacon
street
came
a
few
minutes
later
with
welcomes
and
congratulations
alfred
bestowed
a
different
sort
of
glance
on
his
cousin
eulalia
and
they
both
blushed
as
young
people
often
do
without
knowing
the
reason
why
rosen
blumen
and
lila
had
been
studying
with
her
the
language
of
their
father
country
and
when
the
general
fervor
had
somewhat
abated
the
girls
manifested
some
disposition
to
show
off
the
accomplishment
do
hear
them
calling
alfred
lieber
said
flora
to
her
husband
while
rosa
and
i
are
sprinkling
them
all
with
pet
names
in
french
and
spanish
what
a
polyglot
family
we
are
as
used
to
say
but
florimond
did
you
notice
anything
peculiar
in
the
meeting
between
alfred
and
eulalia
i
thought
i
did
he
replied
how
will
brother
king
like
it
she
asked
he
thinks
very
highly
of
alfred
but
you
know
he
has
a
theory
against
the
marriage
of
cousins
so
have
i
answered
blumenthal
but
nations
and
races
have
been
pretty
thoroughly
mixed
up
in
the
ancestry
of
our
children
what
with
african
and
french
spanish
american
and
german
i
think
the
dangers
of
too
close
relationship
are
safely
diminished
they
are
a
set
between
you
and
i
said
flora
though
they
oddly
mixed
up
see
eulalia
with
her
great
blue
eyes
and
her
dark
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
rosen
blumen
looks
just
like
a
handsome
italian
girl
no
one
would
think
lila
blumen
was
her
sister
with
her
german
blue
eyes
and
that
fine
frizzle
of
curly
light
hair
your
gave
her
the
flax
and
i
suppose
mine
did
the
frizzling
this
side
conversation
was
interrupted
by
king
saying
blumenthal
you
have
asked
for
news
concerning
fitzgerald
you
know
green
has
been
a
widower
for
some
time
report
says
that
he
finds
in
her
company
great
consolation
for
the
death
of
her
cousin
that
what
i
call
a
capital
arrangement
said
flora
and
i
mean
any
joke
about
their
money
either
wo
they
sympathize
grandly
wo
she
be
in
her
element
top
notch
no
end
to
balls
and
parties
and
a
coat
of
arms
on
the
coach
the
news
made
me
very
glad
observed
rosa
for
the
thought
of
her
loneliness
always
cast
a
shadow
over
my
happiness
even
have
grown
a
little
during
the
war
rejoined
king
nabob
green
as
they
call
him
did
actually
contribute
money
for
the
raising
of
colored
regiments
he
so
far
abated
his
prejudice
as
to
be
willing
that
negroes
should
have
the
honor
of
being
shot
in
his
stead
and
fitzgerald
agreed
with
him
that
was
a
considerable
advance
you
must
admit
they
went
on
for
some
time
talking
over
news
public
and
private
not
omitting
the
prospects
of
tom
children
and
the
progress
of
tulee
but
such
family
chats
are
like
the
showers
of
manna
delicious
as
they
fall
but
incapable
of
preservation
the
first
evening
the
families
met
at
the
house
in
beacon
street
blumenthal
expressed
a
wish
to
see
henriet
and
she
was
summoned
the
improvement
in
her
appearance
impressed
him
greatly
having
lived
three
years
with
kindly
and
judicious
friends
who
never
reminded
her
directly
or
indirectly
that
she
was
a
black
sheep
in
the
social
flock
her
faculties
had
developed
freely
and
naturally
and
belonging
to
an
imitative
race
she
readily
adopted
the
language
and
manners
of
those
around
her
her
features
were
not
handsome
with
the
exception
of
her
dark
eyes
and
her
black
hair
was
too
crisp
to
make
a
soft
shading
for
her
brown
forehead
but
there
was
a
winning
expression
of
gentleness
in
her
countenance
and
a
pleasing
degree
of
modest
ease
in
her
demeanor
a
map
which
she
had
copied
very
neatly
was
exhibited
and
a
manuscript
book
of
poems
of
her
own
selection
written
very
correctly
in
a
fine
flowing
hand
really
this
is
encouraging
said
blumenthal
as
she
left
the
room
if
half
a
century
of
just
treatment
and
free
schools
can
bring
them
all
up
to
this
level
our
battles
will
not
be
in
vain
and
we
shall
deserve
to
rank
among
the
best
benefactors
of
the
country
to
say
nothing
of
a
corresponding
improvement
in
the
white
population
thitherward
is
providence
leading
us
replied
king
not
unto
us
but
unto
god
be
all
the
glory
we
were
all
of
us
working
for
better
than
we
knew
king
had
written
to
george
falkner
to
inform
him
of
a
situation
he
had
in
store
for
him
at
marseilles
and
to
request
a
previous
meeting
in
new
york
as
soon
as
he
could
obtain
his
discharge
from
the
army
being
in
this
as
in
all
other
arrangements
delicately
careful
to
avoid
giving
annoyance
to
fitzgerald
in
talking
this
over
with
his
wife
he
said
i
consider
it
a
duty
to
go
to
marseilles
with
him
it
will
give
us
a
chance
to
become
acquainted
with
each
other
it
will
shield
him
from
possible
impertinences
on
the
passage
on
henriet
account
and
it
will
be
an
advantage
to
him
to
be
introduced
as
my
friend
to
the
american
consul
and
some
commercial
gentlemen
of
my
acquaintance
i
am
to
go
with
you
am
i
not
asked
rosa
i
am
curious
to
see
this
young
man
from
whom
i
parted
so
unconscious
of
all
the
strange
future
when
he
was
a
baby
in
tulee
arms
i
think
you
had
better
not
go
dear
he
replied
though
the
loss
of
your
company
will
deprive
me
of
a
great
pleasure
eulalia
would
naturally
wish
to
go
with
us
and
as
she
knows
nothing
of
private
history
it
would
be
unwise
to
excite
her
curiosity
by
introducing
her
to
such
a
striking
likeness
of
gerald
but
she
might
stay
with
rosen
blumen
while
you
go
to
new
york
and
remain
with
me
till
the
vessel
sails
if
i
meet
with
no
accidents
i
shall
return
in
three
months
for
i
go
merely
to
give
george
a
fair
start
though
when
there
i
shall
have
an
eye
to
some
other
business
and
take
a
run
to
italy
to
look
in
upon
our
good
old
friends
madame
and
the
signor
the
journey
to
new
york
was
made
at
the
appointed
time
in
company
with
henriet
and
her
little
one
george
had
risen
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
in
the
army
and
had
acquired
a
military
bearing
that
considerably
increased
the
manliness
of
his
appearance
he
was
browned
by
exposure
to
sun
and
wind
but
he
so
strongly
resembled
her
handsome
gerald
that
rosa
longed
to
clasp
him
to
her
heart
his
appearance
evidently
took
him
by
surprise
how
you
have
changed
he
exclaimed
what
a
lady
you
are
i
can
hardly
believe
this
is
the
little
hen
i
used
to
make
mud
pies
with
she
laughed
as
she
answered
you
are
changed
too
if
i
have
improved
it
is
owing
to
these
kind
friends
only
think
of
it
george
though
king
is
such
a
handsome
and
grand
lady
she
always
called
me
mrs
falkner
king
made
several
appropriate
parting
presents
to
henriet
and
little
hetty
to
george
she
gave
a
gold
watch
and
a
very
beautiful
colored
photograph
of
gerald
in
a
morocco
case
as
a
souvenir
of
their
brief
friendship
in
the
army
king
availed
himself
of
every
hour
of
the
voyage
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
young
man
and
to
instil
some
salutary
lessons
into
his
very
receptive
mind
after
they
had
become
well
acquainted
he
said
i
have
made
an
estimate
of
what
i
think
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
spend
for
rent
food
and
clothing
also
of
what
i
think
it
would
be
wise
for
you
to
spend
in
improving
your
education
and
for
occasional
amusements
i
have
not
done
this
in
the
spirit
of
dictation
my
young
friend
but
merely
with
the
wish
of
helping
you
by
my
greater
experience
of
life
it
is
important
that
you
should
learn
to
write
a
good
commercial
hand
and
also
acquire
as
soon
as
possible
a
very
thorough
knowledge
of
the
french
language
for
these
you
should
employ
the
best
teachers
that
can
be
found
your
wife
can
help
you
in
many
ways
she
has
learned
to
spell
correctly
to
read
with
fluency
and
expression
and
to
play
quite
well
on
the
piano
you
will
find
it
very
profitable
to
read
good
books
aloud
to
each
other
i
advise
you
not
to
go
to
places
of
amusement
oftener
than
once
a
fortnight
and
always
to
choose
such
places
as
will
be
suitable
and
pleasant
for
your
wife
i
like
that
young
men
in
my
employ
should
never
taste
intoxicating
drinks
or
use
tobacco
in
any
form
both
those
habits
are
expensive
and
i
have
long
ago
abjured
them
as
injurious
to
health
the
young
man
bowed
and
replied
i
will
do
as
you
wish
in
all
respects
sir
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
if
i
did
not
i
shall
give
you
eight
hundred
dollars
for
the
first
year
resumed
king
and
shall
increase
your
salary
year
by
year
according
to
your
conduct
and
capabilities
if
you
are
industrious
temperate
and
economical
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
become
a
rich
man
in
time
and
it
will
be
wise
for
you
to
educate
yourself
your
wife
and
your
children
with
a
view
to
the
station
you
will
have
it
in
your
power
to
acquire
if
you
do
your
best
you
may
rely
upon
my
influence
and
my
fatherly
interest
to
help
you
all
i
can
the
young
man
colored
and
after
a
little
embarrassed
hesitation
said
you
spoke
of
a
fatherly
interest
sir
and
that
reminds
me
that
i
never
had
a
father
may
i
ask
whether
you
know
anything
about
my
parents
king
had
anticipated
the
possibility
of
such
a
question
and
he
replied
i
will
tell
you
who
your
father
was
if
you
will
give
a
solemn
promise
never
to
ask
a
single
question
about
your
mother
on
that
subject
i
have
given
a
pledge
of
secrecy
which
it
would
be
dishonorable
for
me
to
break
only
this
much
i
will
say
that
neither
of
your
parents
was
related
to
me
in
any
degree
or
connected
with
me
in
any
way
the
young
man
answered
that
he
was
of
course
very
desirous
to
know
his
whole
history
but
would
be
glad
to
obtain
any
information
and
was
willing
to
give
the
required
promise
which
he
would
most
religiously
keep
king
then
went
on
to
say
your
father
was
gerald
fitzgerald
a
planter
in
georgia
you
have
a
right
to
his
name
and
i
will
so
introduce
you
to
my
friends
if
you
wish
it
he
inherited
a
handsome
fortune
but
lost
it
all
by
gambling
and
other
forms
of
dissipation
he
had
several
children
by
various
mothers
you
and
the
gerald
with
whom
you
became
acquainted
were
brothers
by
the
father
side
you
are
unmixed
white
but
you
were
left
in
the
care
of
a
negro
nurse
and
one
of
your
father
creditors
seized
you
both
and
sold
you
into
slavery
until
a
few
months
before
you
were
acquainted
with
gerald
it
was
supposed
that
you
died
in
infancy
and
for
that
reason
no
efforts
were
made
to
redeem
you
circumstances
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
explain
led
to
the
discovery
that
you
were
living
and
that
gerald
had
learned
your
history
as
a
slave
i
feel
the
strongest
sympathy
with
your
misfortunes
and
cherish
a
lively
gratitude
for
your
kindness
to
my
young
friend
gerald
all
that
i
have
told
you
is
truth
and
if
it
were
in
my
power
i
would
most
gladly
tell
you
the
truth
the
young
man
listened
with
the
deepest
interest
and
having
expressed
his
thanks
said
he
should
prefer
to
be
called
by
his
father
name
for
he
thought
he
should
feel
more
like
a
man
to
bear
a
name
to
which
he
knew
that
he
had
a
right
when
king
again
returned
to
his
boston
home
as
soon
as
the
first
eager
salutations
were
over
he
exclaimed
how
the
room
is
decorated
with
vines
and
flowers
it
reminds
me
of
that
dear
floral
parlor
in
new
orleans
did
you
telegraph
that
you
were
coming
and
is
it
not
your
birthday
inquired
his
wife
he
kissed
her
and
said
well
rosabella
i
think
you
may
now
have
a
tranquil
mind
for
i
believe
things
have
been
so
arranged
that
no
one
is
very
seriously
injured
by
that
act
of
frenzy
which
has
caused
you
so
much
suffering
george
will
not
be
deprived
of
any
of
his
pecuniary
rights
and
he
is
in
a
fair
way
to
become
more
of
a
man
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
been
brought
up
in
luxury
he
and
henriet
are
as
happy
in
their
prospects
as
two
mortals
well
can
be
gerald
enjoyed
his
short
life
and
was
more
bewildered
than
troubled
by
the
discovery
that
he
had
two
mothers
eulalia
was
a
tender
romantic
memory
to
him
and
such
i
think
he
has
become
to
our
child
i
do
believe
fitzgerald
suffered
much
more
than
annoyance
gerald
was
always
the
same
to
her
as
a
son
and
if
he
had
been
really
so
he
would
probably
have
gone
to
the
war
and
have
run
the
same
chance
of
being
killed
ah
alfred
she
replied
i
should
never
have
found
my
way
out
of
that
wretched
entanglement
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
you
have
really
acted
toward
me
the
part
of
divine
providence
it
makes
me
ashamed
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
do
anything
in
atonement
for
my
own
fault
except
the
pain
i
suffered
in
giving
up
my
gerald
to
his
when
i
think
how
that
poor
babe
became
enslaved
by
my
act
i
long
to
sell
my
diamonds
and
use
the
money
to
build
for
the
freedmen
those
diamonds
seem
to
trouble
you
dearest
rejoined
he
smiling
i
have
no
objection
to
your
selling
them
you
become
them
and
they
become
you
but
i
think
will
shine
as
brighter
jewels
in
the
better
world
here
flora
came
in
with
all
her
tribe
and
when
the
welcomes
were
over
her
first
inquiries
were
for
madame
and
the
signor
they
are
well
replied
king
and
they
seem
to
be
as
contented
as
tabbies
on
a
wilton
rug
they
show
signs
of
age
of
course
the
signor
has
done
being
peppery
and
madame
energy
has
visibly
abated
but
her
mind
is
as
lively
as
ever
i
wish
i
could
remember
half
the
stories
she
repeated
about
the
merry
pranks
of
your
childhood
she
asked
a
great
many
questions
about
and
she
laughed
till
she
cried
while
she
described
in
dramatic
style
how
you
crazed
the
poor
bird
with
imitations
till
she
called
you
petit
how
i
wish
i
had
known
mamma
then
how
funny
she
must
have
been
exclaimed
lila
i
think
you
have
heard
some
performances
of
hers
that
were
equally
funny
rejoined
delano
i
used
to
be
entertained
with
a
variety
of
them
especially
when
we
were
in
italy
if
any
of
the
went
by
she
would
imitate
the
drone
of
their
bagpipes
in
a
manner
irresistibly
comic
and
if
she
saw
a
dancing
she
forthwith
went
through
the
performance
to
the
life
yes
mamita
responded
flora
and
you
know
i
fancied
myself
a
great
musical
composer
in
those
days
a
sort
of
feminine
mozart
but
the
was
always
the
key
i
composed
in
i
used
to
think
the
fairies
helped
you
about
that
as
well
as
other
things
replied
delano
i
think
the
fairies
help
her
now
said
blumenthal
and
well
they
may
for
she
is
of
their
kith
and
kin
this
playful
trifling
was
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
the
rolling
apart
and
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
adjoining
room
a
tableau
became
visible
in
honor
of
the
birthday
under
festoons
of
the
american
flag
surmounted
by
the
eagle
stood
eulalia
in
ribbons
of
red
white
and
blue
with
a
circle
of
stars
round
her
head
one
hand
upheld
the
shield
of
the
union
and
in
the
other
the
scales
of
justice
were
evenly
poised
by
her
side
stood
rosen
blumen
holding
in
one
hand
a
gilded
pole
surmounted
by
a
while
her
other
hand
rested
protectingly
on
the
head
of
tulee
benny
who
was
kneeling
and
looking
upward
in
thanksgiving
scarcely
had
the
vision
appeared
before
joe
bright
voice
was
heard
leading
invisible
singers
through
the
tune
hail
to
the
chief
which
alfred
blumenthal
accompanied
with
a
piano
as
they
sang
the
last
line
the
striped
festoons
fell
and
veiled
the
tableau
then
mr
bright
who
had
returned
a
captain
appeared
with
his
company
consisting
of
tom
and
chloe
with
their
children
and
tulee
with
her
children
singing
a
parody
composed
by
himself
of
which
the
chorus
was
blow
ye
the
trumpet

praise
to

god
of

was

jehovah
that
triumphed
columbia
through
thee
to
increase
the
effect
the
director
of
ceremonies
had
added
a
flourish
of
trumpets
behind
the
scenes
then
the
colored
band
came
forward
hand
in
hand
and
sang
together
with
a
will
whittier
immortal
boat
song

and
when

had
shaken

with
them
all
they
adjourned
to
the
where
refreshments
were
plentifully
provided
at
last
mr
bright
said
i
do
want
to
bid
you
good
night
friends
but
i
must
i
do
generally
like
to
go
among
boston
folks
just
look
at
the
trees
on
the
common
they
dying
because
they
rolled
the
surface
of
the
ground
so
smooth
that
just
the
way
in
boston
i
reckon
they
take
so
much
pains
to
make
the
surface
smooth
that
it
kills
the
roots
o
things
but
when
i
come
here
or
go
to
blumenthal
i
feel
as
if
the
roots
o
things
killed
good
night
friends
i
have
enjoyed
myself
so
well
since
i
found
old
hundred
and
yankee
doodle
in
the
harmolinks
the
sound
of
his
whistling
died
away
in
the
streets
the
young
people
went
off
to
talk
over
their
festival
the
colored
troop
retired
to
rest
and
the
elders
of
the
two
families
sat
together
in
the
stillness
holding
sweet
converse
concerning
the
many
strange
experiences
that
had
been
so
richly
crowned
with
blessings
a
new
surprise
awaited
them
prepared
by
the
good
taste
of
blumenthal
a
german
liederkrantz
in
the
hall
closed
the
ceremonies
of
the
night
with
mendelssohn
song
of
praise
