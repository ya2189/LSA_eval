chapter
i
the
ancient
port
of
sunwich
was
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
a
july
afternoon
a
rattle
of
cranes
and
winches
sounded
from
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
but
the
town
itself
was
half
asleep
somnolent
shopkeepers
in
dim
back
parlours
coyly
veiled
their
faces
in
red
handkerchiefs
from
the
too
ardent
flies
while
small
boys
left
in
charge
noticed
listlessly
the
slow
passing
of
time
as
recorded
by
the
church
clock
it
is
a
fine
church
and
sunwich
is
proud
of
it
the
tall
grey
tower
is
a
landmark
at
sea
but
from
the
narrow
streets
of
the
little
town
itself
it
has
a
disquieting
appearance
of
rising
suddenly
above
the
roofs
huddled
beneath
it
for
the
purpose
of
displaying
a
clock
with
gilt
numerals
whose
mellow
chimes
have
recorded
the
passing
hours
for
many
generations
of
sunwich
men
regardless
of
the
heat
which
indeed
was
mild
compared
with
that
which
raged
in
his
own
bosom
captain
nugent
fresh
from
the
inquiry
of
the
collision
of
his
ship
conqueror
with
the
german
barque
hans
muller
strode
rapidly
up
the
high
street
in
the
direction
of
home
an
honest
seafaring
smell
compounded
of
tar
rope
and
fish
known
to
the
educated
of
sunwich
as
ozone
set
his
thoughts
upon
the
sea
he
longed
to
be
aboard
ship
again
with
the
court
of
inquiry
to
form
part
of
his
crew
in
all
his
fifty
years
of
life
he
had
never
met
such
a
collection
of
fools
his
hard
blue
eyes
blazed
as
he
thought
of
them
and
the
mouth
hidden
by
his
beard
was
set
with
anger
samson
wilks
his
steward
who
had
been
with
him
to
london
to
give
evidence
had
had
a
time
upon
which
he
looked
back
in
later
years
with
much
satisfaction
at
his
powers
of
endurance
he
was
with
the
captain
and
yet
not
with
him
when
they
got
out
of
the
train
at
sunwich
he
hesitated
as
to
whether
he
should
follow
the
captain
or
leave
him
his
excuse
for
following
was
the
bag
his
reason
for
leaving
the
volcanic
condition
of
its
owner
temper
coupled
with
the
fact
that
he
appeared
to
be
sublimely
ignorant
that
the
most
devoted
steward
in
the
world
was
tagging
faithfully
along
a
yard
or
two
in
the
rear
the
few
glanced
at
the
couple
with
interest
wilks
had
what
is
called
an
expressive
face
and
he
had
worked
his
sandy
eyebrows
his
weak
blue
eyes
and
large
tremulous
mouth
into
such
an
expression
of
surprise
at
the
finding
of
the
court
that
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
beholder
of
visions
he
changed
the
bag
to
his
other
hand
as
they
left
the
town
behind
them
and
regarded
with
gratitude
the
approaching
end
of
his
labours
at
the
of
a
house
some
along
the
road
the
captain
stopped
and
after
an
impatient
fumbling
at
the
latch
strode
up
the
path
followed
by
wilks
and
knocked
at
the
door
as
he
paused
on
the
step
he
half
turned
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
the
facial
expression
of
his
faithful
follower
the
dickens
are
you
looking
like
that
for
he
demanded
been
surprised
sir
conceded
wilks
and
wrath
blazed
again
in
the
captain
eyes
and
set
lines
in
his
forehead
he
was
being
pitied
by
a
steward
been
drinking
he
said
crisply
that
bag
your
pardon
sir
said
the
steward
twisting
his
unusually
dry
lips
into
a
smile
i
no
opportunity
sir
i
been
follerin
you
all
day
a
servant
opened
the
door
been
soaking
in
it
for
a
month
declared
the
captain
as
he
entered
the
hall
the
blazes
do
you
bring
that
bag
in
are
you
so
drunk
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
wilks
picked
the
bag
up
and
followed
humbly
into
the
house
then
he
lost
his
head
altogether
and
gave
some
colour
to
his
superior
officer
charges
by
first
cannoning
into
the
servant
and
then
wedging
the
captain
firmly
in
the
doorway
of
the
with
the
bag
rasped
the
captain
said
the
unhappy
wilks
and
sit
down
in
the
kitchen
and
do
leave
this
house
till
you
wilks
disappeared
he
was
not
in
his
first
lustre
but
he
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
sex
and
in
an
way
he
passed
his
arm
round
the
handmaiden
waist
and
sustained
a
buffet
which
made
his
head
ring
man
o
your
age
and
drunk
too
explained
the
damsel
wilks
denied
both
charges
it
appeared
that
he
was
much
younger
than
he
looked
while
as
for
drink
he
had
forgotten
the
taste
of
it
a
question
as
to
the
reception
ann
would
have
accorded
a
boyish
teetotaler
remained
unanswered
in
the
kingdom
the
captain
widowed
sister
put
down
her
as
her
brother
entered
and
turned
to
him
expectantly
there
was
an
expression
of
loving
sympathy
on
her
mild
and
rather
foolish
face
and
the
captain
stiffened
at
once
was
in
the
wrong
he
said
harshly
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair

been
suspended
for
six
months
and
my
first
officer
has
been
gasped
kingdom
pushing
back
the
white
streamer
to
the
cap
which
she
wore
in
memory
of
the
late
kingdom
and
sitting
upright
think
that
what
i
said
replied
her
brother
kingdom
gazed
at
him
mournfully
and
putting
her
hand
behind
her
began
a
wriggling
search
in
her
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
with
the
idea
of
paying
a
wholesome
tribute
of
tears
she
was
a
in
the
art
of
grief
and
pending
its
extraction
a
docile
tear
hung
on
her
eyelid
and
waited
the
captain
eyed
her
preparations
with
silent
anger
am
not
surprised
said
kingdom
dabbing
her
eyes
expected
it
somehow
i
seemed
to
have
a
warning
of
it
something
seemed
to
tell
me
i
could
explain
but
i
seemed
to
she
sniffed
gently
and
wiping
one
eye
at
a
time
kept
the
disengaged
one
charged
with
sisterly
solicitude
upon
her
brother
the
captain
with
steadily
rising
anger
endured
this
game
of
for
five
minutes
then
he
rose
and
muttering
strange
things
in
his
beard
stalked
upstairs
to
his
room
kingdom
thus
forsaken
dried
her
eyes
and
resumed
her
work
the
remainder
of
the
family
were
in
the
kitchen
ministering
to
the
wants
of
a
misunderstood
steward
and
in
return
extracting
information
which
should
render
them
independent
of
the
captain
version
it
very
solemn
sam
inquired
miss
nugent
aged
nine
who
was
sitting
on
the
kitchen
table
wilks
used
his
hands
and
eyebrows
to
indicate
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
even
made
the
leave
off
speaking
he
said
in
an
awed
voice
should
have
liked
to
have
been
there
said
master
nugent
dutifully
said
miss
nugent
and
draw

ann

of
beer
repeated
miss
nugent
peremptorily
ann
took
a
jug
from
the
dresser
and
wilks
who
was
watching
her
coughed
helplessly
his
perturbation
attracted
the
attention
of
his
hostess
and
looking
round
for
the
cause
she
was
just
in
time
to
see
ann
disappearing
into
the
larder
with
a
cream
jug
big
jug
ann
she
said
impatiently
ought
to
know
sam
would
like
a
big
ann
changed
the
jugs
and
ignoring
a
mild
triumph
in
wilks
eye
returned
to
the
larder
whence
ensued
a
musical
trickling
then
miss
nugent
raising
the
jug
with
some
difficulty
poured
out
a
tumbler
for
the
steward
with
her
own
fair
hands
likes
beer
she
said
speaking
generally
knew
that
the
first
time

see
him
miss
remarked
the
vindictive
ann
wilks
drained
his
glass
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
again
making
a
feeble
gesture
of
repulse
as
miss
nugent
refilled
it
on
sam
she
said
with
kindly
encouragement
much
does
this
jug
hold

replied
her
brother

quarts

there
in
a
gallon
miss
nugent
looked
troubled

say
he
drinks

a
day
she
remarked

wilks
hurriedly

used
to
prefer
to
it
in
a
basin
odd
man
was
like
wilks
in
the
face
only
wilks
sat
upright
and
in
the
mental
struggle
involved
in
taking
in
this
insult
in
all
its
ramifications
did
not
notice
until
too
late
that
miss
nugent
had
filled
his
glass
again
must
ha
been
nice
for
the
captain
to
you
with
remarked
ann
carelessly
was
said
wilks
pausing
with
the
glass
at
his
lips
and
eyeing
her
sternly

closer
to
him
on
the
table
and
regarding

affectionately
as

wilks
setting
down
his
glass
and
regarding
ann
giggles
with
a
cold
eye
miss

sighed

she
said
simply

words
miss
nugent
was
undisguisedly
affected
and
wiping
her
bright
eyes
with
her
pinafore
gave
her
small
nose
a
slight
touch
en
passant
with
the
same
useful
garment
and
squeezed
his
arm

as
soon
as
your

came
on
deck

commended
and
your

certifikit
was
suspended
for

master
nugent
whistled
thoughtfully
and
quitting
the
kitchen
proceeded
upstairs
to
his
room
and
first
washing
himself
with
unusual
care
for
a
boy
of
thirteen
put
on
a
clean
collar
and
brushed
his
hair
he
was
not
going
to
provide
a
suspended
with
any
obvious
reasons
for
while
he
was
thus
occupied
the
bell
rang
and
ann
answering
it
left
wilks
in
the
kitchen
listening
with
some
trepidation
to
the
conversation
that
steward
of
mine
still
in
the
kitchen
demanded
the
captain
gruffly
said
ann
he
doing
wilks
ears
quivered
anxiously
and
he
eyed
with
unwonted
disfavour
the
evidences
of
his
late
debauch
down
sir
replied
ann
him
a
glass
of
ale
and
send
him
off
commanded
the
captain
if
that
was
miss
kate
i
heard
talking
send
her
in
to
ann
took
the
message
back
to
the
kitchen
and
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
engaged
upon
an
unpleasant
task
drew
wilks
another
glass
of
ale
and
stood
over
him
with
wonder
while
he
drank
it

into

chapter
ii
the
downfall
of
captain
nugent
was
for
some
time
a
welcome
subject
of
conversation
in
marine
circles
at
sunwich
at
the
goblets
a
rambling
old
inn
with
paved
courtyard
and
wooden
galleries
which
almost
backed
on
to
the
churchyard
attributed
it
to
an
error
of
judgment
at
the
two
schooners
on
the
quay
the
profanest
of
sailormen
readily
attributed
it
to
an
providence
with
a
dislike
of
the
captain
cup
was
filled
to
the
brim
by
the
promotion
of
his
first
officer
to
the
command
of
the
conqueror
it
was
by
far
the
largest
craft
which
sailed
from
the
port
of
sunwich
and
its
master
held
a
corresponding
dignity
amongst
the
captains
of
lesser
vessels
their
allegiance
was
now
transferred
to
captain
hardy
and
the
master
of
a
brig
which
was
in
the
last
stages
of
senile
decay
meeting
nugent
in
the
goblets
actually
showed
him
by
means
of
two
lucifer
matches
how
the
collision
might
have
been
avoided
a
touching
feature
in
the
business
and
a
source
of
much
gratification
to
wilks
by
the
sentimental
applause
evoked
by
it
was
his
renunciation
of
the
post
of
steward
on
the
ss
conqueror
sunwich
buzzed
with
the
tidings
that
after
eighteen
years
service
with
captain
nugent
he
preferred
starvation
ashore
to
serving
under
another
master
although
comfortable
in
pocket
and
known
to
be
living
with
his
mother
who
kept
a
small
general
shop
he
was
regarded
as
a
man
on
the
brink
of
starvation
pints
were
thrust
upon
him
and
the
tale
of
his
nobility
increased
with
much
narration
it
was
considered
that
the
whole
race
of
stewards
had
acquired
fresh
lustre
from
his
action
his
only
unfavourable
critic
was
the
erring
captain
himself
he
sent
a
peremptory
summons
to
wilks
to
attend
at
equator
lodge
and
the
moment
he
set
eyes
upon
that
piece
of
probity
embarked
upon
such
a
vilification
of
his
personal
defects
and
character
as
wilks
had
never
even
dreamt
of
he
wound
up
by
ordering
him
to
rejoin
the
ship
forthwith
your
pardon
sir
said
wilks
with
tender
reproach
i
you
going
to
live
on
your
mother
you
hulking
rascal
quoth
the
incensed
captain
sir
said
wilks
got
a
little
money
sir
enough
for
my
few
wants
till
we
sail
i
sail
again
you
wo
come
with
me
said
the
captain
grimly
suppose
you
want
an
excuse
for
a
soak
ashore
for
six
months
wilks
twiddled
his
cap
in
his
hands
and
smiled
weakly
thought
as
you
like
me
to
come
round
and
wait
at
table
and
help
with
the
knives
and
boots
and
he
said
softly
is
out
of
the
house
said
the
captain
in
quiet
measured
tones
wilks
went
but
on
his
way
to
the
gate
he
picked
up
three
pieces
of
paper
which
had
blown
into
the
garden
weeded
two
pieces
of
grass
from
the
path
and
carefully
removed
a
dead
branch
from
a
laurel
facing
the
window
he
would
have
done
more
but
for
an
imperative
knocking
on
the
glass
and
he
left
the
premises
sadly
putting
his
collection
of
rubbish
over
the
next
garden
fence
as
he
passed
it
but
the
next
day
the
captain
boots
bore
such
a
polish
that
he
was
able
to
view
his
own
startled
face
in
them
and
at
the
brightness
of
the
knives
was
so
conspicuous
that
kingdom
called
ann
in
for
the
purpose
of
asking
her
why
she
did
always
do
them
like
that
her
brother
ate
his
meal
in
silence
and
going
to
his
room
afterwards
discovered
every
pair
of
boots
he
possessed
headed
by
the
tall
standing
in
a
nicely
graduated
line
by
the
wall
and
all
shining
their
hardest
for
two
days
did
wilks
do
good
by
stealth
leaving
ann
to
blush
to
find
it
fame
but
on
the
third
day
at
dinner
as
the
captain
took
up
his
knife
and
fork
to
carve
he
became
aware
of
a
shadow
standing
behind
his
chair
a
shadow
in
a
blue
coat
with
metal
buttons
which
whipping
up
the
first
plate
carved
carried
it
to
kingdom
and
then
leaned
against
her
with
the
vegetable
dishes
the
dishes
clattered
a
little
on
his
arm
as
he
helped
the
captain
but
the
latter
after
an
impressive
pause
and
a
vain
attempt
to
catch
the
eye
of
wilks
which
was
intent
upon
things
afar
off
took
up
the
spoon
and
helped
himself
from
the
unwonted
silence
of
miss
nugent
in
the
presence
of
anything
unusual
it
was
clear
to
him
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
carefully
arranged
he
ate
in
silence
and
a
resolution
to
kick
wilks
off
the
premises
vanished
before
the
comfort
to
say
nothing
of
the
dignity
afforded
by
his
presence
wilks
somewhat
reassured
favoured
miss
nugent
with
a
wink
to
which
although
she
had
devoted
much
time
in
trying
to
acquire
the
art
she
endeavoured
in
vain
to
respond
it
was
on
the
day
following
this
that
jack
nugent
at
his
sister
instigation
made
an
attempt
to
avenge
the
family
honour
miss
nugent
although
she
treated
him
with
scant
courtesy
herself
had
a
touching
faith
in
his
prowess
a
faith
partly
due
to
her
brother
occasionally
showing
her
his
bicep
muscles
in
moments
of
exaltation
that
horrid
jem
hardy
she
said
suddenly
as
they
walked
along
the
road
it
is
said
master
nugent
but
without
any
display
of
enthusiasm
jack
shouted
master
hardy
across
the
road
suspense
became
responded
the
other
going
to
fight
you
shrilled
miss
nugent
who
thought
these
amenities
said
master
hardy
crossed
the
road
for
he
demanded
with
surprise
you
a
nasty
horrid
boy
replied
miss
nugent
drawing
herself
up
said
master
hardy
blankly
the
two
gentlemen
stood
regarding
each
other
with
uneasy
grins
the
lady
stood
by
in
breathless
expectation
the
suspense
became
painful
are
you
staring
at
demanded
master
nugent
at
last
replied
the
other
are
you
staring
at
said
master
nugent
defiantly
there
was
a
long
interval
both
gentlemen
experiencing
some
difficulty
in
working
up
sufficient
heat
for
the
engagement
hit
me
and
see
what
you
get
said
master
hardy
at
length
hit
me
said
the
other
cowardy
custard
chanted
the
miss
nugent
his
mother
mustard
cowardy
cowardy
cus
do
you
send
that
kid
home
demanded
master
hardy
eyeing
the
fair
songstress
with
strong
disfavour
leave
my
sister
alone
said
the
other
giving
him
a
light
tap
on
the
shoulder
your
coward
master
hardy
made
a
ceremonious
return
yours
he
said
go
behind
the
his
foe
assented
and
they
proceeded
in
grave
silence
to
a
piece
of
grass
screened
by
trees
which
stood
between
the
church
and
the
beach
here
they
removed
their
coats
and
rolled
up
their
things
look
different
out
of
doors
and
to
miss
nugent
the
arms
of
both
gentlemen
seemed
somewhat
in
their
proportions
the
preliminaries
were
awful
both
combatants
prancing
round
each
other
with
their
faces
just
peering
above
their
bent
right
arms
while
their
trusty
lefts
dealt
vicious
blows
at
the
air
miss
nugent
turned
pale
and
caught
her
breath
at
each
blow
then
she
suddenly
reddened
with
wrath
as
james
philip
hardy
having
paid
his
tribute
to
science
began
to
hammer
john
augustus
nugent
about
the
face
in
a
most
painful
and
workmanlike
fashion
she
hid
her
face
for
a
moment
and
when
she
looked
again
jack
was
on
the
ground
and
master
hardy
just
rising
from
his
prostrate
body
then
jack
rose
slowly
and
crossing
over
to
her
borrowed
her
handkerchief
and
applied
it
with
great
tenderness
to
his
nose
it
hurt
jack
she
inquired
anxiously
growled
her
brother
he
threw
down
the
handkerchief
and
turned
to
his
opponent
again
miss
nugent
who
was
careful
about
her
property
stooped
to
recover
it
and
immediately
found
herself
involved
in
a
twisting
tangle
of
legs
from
which
she
escaped
by
a
miracle
to
see
master
hardy
cuddling
her
brother
round
the
neck
with
one
hand
and
punching
him
as
hard
and
as
fast
as
he
could
with
the
other
the
unfairness
of
it
maddened
her
and
the
next
moment
master
hardy
head
was
drawn
forcibly
backwards
by
the
hair
the
pain
was
so
excruciating
that
he
released
his
victim
at
once
and
miss
nugent
emitting
a
series
of
terrified
yelps
dashed
off
in
the
direction
of
home
her
hair
bobbing
up
and
down
on
her
shoulders
and
her
small
black
legs
in
an
ecstasy
of
motion
master
hardy
with
no
very
ideas
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
if
he
caught
her
started
in
pursuit
his
scalp
was
still
smarting
and
his
eyes
watering
with
the
pain
as
he
pounded
behind
her
panting
wildly
she
heard
him
coming
closer
and
closer
and
she
was
just
about
to
give
up
when
to
her
joy
she
saw
her
father
coming
towards
them
master
hardy
intent
on
his
quarry
saw
him
just
in
time
and
swerving
into
the
road
passed
in
safety
as
miss
nugent
flung
herself
with
some
violence
at
her
father
waistcoat
and
clinging
to
him
convulsively
fought
for
breath
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
furnish
the
astonished
captain
with
full
details
and
she
was
pleased
to
find
that
his
indignation
led
him
to
ignore
the
episode
on
which
to
do
her
justice
she
touched
but
lightly
that
evening
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
captain
nugent
after
some
deliberation
called
upon
his
late
mate
the
old
servant
who
since
hardy
death
the
year
before
had
looked
after
the
house
was
out
and
hardy
unaware
of
the
honour
intended
him
was
scandalized
by
the
manner
in
which
his
son
received
the
visitor
the
door
opened
there
was
an
involuntary
grunt
from
master
hardy
and
the
next
moment
he
sped
along
the
narrow
passage
and
darted
upstairs
his
father
after
waiting
in
vain
for
his
return
went
to
the
door
himself
evening
he
said
in
surprise
nugent
responded
gruffly
and
followed
him
into
the
to
an
invitation
to
sit
he
responded
more
gruffly
still
that
he
preferred
to
stand
he
then
demanded
instant
and
sufficient
punishment
of
master
hardy
for
frightening
his
daughter
even
as
he
spoke
he
noticed
with
strong
disfavour
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
his
late
first
officer
the
change
which
takes
place
when
a
man
is
promoted
from
that
rank
to
that
of
master
is
subtle
but
unmistakable
sometimes
as
in
the
present
instance
more
unmistakable
than
subtle
captain
hardy
coiled
his
long
sinewy
form
in
an
and
eyeing
him
calmly
lit
his
pipe
before
replying
will
fight
he
said
briefly
speaking
of
his
running
after
my
daughter
said
nugent
sternly
hardy
eyes
twinkled
dog
he
said
genially
his
age
captain
nugent
face
was
suffused
with
wrath
at
the
pleasantry
and
he
regarded
him
with
a
fixed
stare
on
board
the
conqueror
there
was
a
witchery
in
that
glance
more
potent
than
the
spoken
word
but
in
his
own
parlour
the
new
captain
met
it
calmly
did
come
here
to
listen
to
your
foolery
said
nugent
came
to
tell
you
to
punish
that
boy
of
i
do
it
replied
the
other
have
got
something
better
to
do
than
interfere
in
children
quarrels
i
have
got
your
spare
time
you
captain
nugent
turned
purple
such
language
from
his
late
first
officer
was
a
revelation
to
him
also
came
to
warn
you
he
said
furiously
i
shall
take
the
law
into
my
own
hands
if
you
aye
said
hardy
with
careless
contempt
tell
him
to
keep
out
of
your
way
but
i
should
advise
you
to
wait
until
i
have
captain
nugent
who
was
moving
towards
the
door
swung
round
and
confronted
him
savagely
do
you
mean
he
demanded
i
say
retorted
captain
hardy
do
want
to
indulge
sunwich
with
the
spectacle
of
two
at
fisticuffs
but
that
what
happen
if
you
touch
my
boy
it
would
probably
please
the
spectators
more
than
it
would
cane
him
the
first
time
i
lay
hands
on
him
roared
captain
nugent
captain
hardy
stock
of
patience
was
at
an
end
and
there
was
moreover
a
long
and
undischarged
account
between
himself
and
his
late
skipper
he
rose
and
crossed
to
the
door
he
cried
downstairs
and
show
captain
nugent
there
was
a
breathless
pause
captain
nugent
ground
his
teeth
with
fury
as
he
saw
the
challenge
and
realized
the
ridiculous
position
into
which
his
temper
had
led
him
and
the
other
who
was
also
careful
of
appearances
repented
the
order
the
moment
he
had
given
it
matters
had
now
however
passed
out
of
their
hands
and
both
men
cast
appraising
glances
at
each
other
form
the
only
one
who
kept
his
head
was
master
hardy
and
it
was
a
source
of
considerable
relief
to
both
of
them
when
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
voice
of
that
youthful
solomon
was
heard
declining
in
the
most
positive
terms
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
captain
hardy
repeated
his
command
the
only
reply
was
the
violent
closing
of
a
door
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
after
waiting
a
short
time
he
led
the
way
to
the
front
door
himself
will
regret
your
insolence
before
i
have
done
with
you
said
his
visitor
as
he
paused
on
the
step
the
old
story
of
a
beggar
on
a
good
story
said
captain
hardy
to
my
mind
it
does
come
up
to
the
one
about
chapter
iii
if
anything
was
wanted
to
convince
captain
nugent
that
his
action
had
been
foolish
and
his
language
intemperate
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
by
the
subsequent
behaviour
of
master
hardy
generosity
is
seldom
an
attribute
of
youth
while
egotism
on
the
other
hand
is
seldom
absent
so
far
from
realizing
that
the
captain
would
have
scorned
such
lowly
game
master
hardy
believed
that
he
lived
for
little
else
and
his
ubiquity
was
a
constant
marvel
and
discomfort
to
that
irritable
mariner
did
he
approach
a
seat
on
the
beach
it
was
master
hardy
who
rose
at
the
last
moment
to
make
room
for
him
did
he
stroll
down
to
the
harbour
it
was
in
the
wake
of
a
small
boy
looking
coyly
at
him
over
his
shoulder
every
small
alley
as
he
passed
seemed
to
contain
a
jem
hardy
who
whizzed
out
like
a
human
firework
in
front
of
him
and
then
followed
dancing
on
his
toes
a
pace
or
two
in
his
rear
this
was
on
on
the
sabbath
master
hardy
daring
ingenuity
led
him
to
still
further
flights
all
the
seats
at
the
parish
church
were
free
but
captain
nugent
whose
admirable
practice
it
was
to
take
his
entire
family
to
church
never
thoroughly
realized
how
free
they
were
until
master
hardy
squeezed
his
way
in
and
taking
a
seat
next
to
him
prayed
with
unwonted
fervour
into
the
interior
of
a
new
hat
and
then
sitting
back
watched
with
polite
composure
the
efforts
of
miss
nugent
family
to
restrain
her
growing
excitement
charmed
with
the
experiment
he
repeated
it
the
following
sunday
this
time
he
boarded
the
seat
from
the
other
end
and
seeing
no
place
by
the
captain
took
one
or
more
correctly
speaking
made
one
between
miss
nugent
and
jack
and
despite
the
former
elbow
began
to
feel
almost
like
one
of
the
family
hostile
feelings
vanished
and
with
an
amiable
smile
at
the
miss
nugent
he
placed
a
of
great
strength
in
his
cheek
and
leaning
forward
for
a
left
one
on
the
ledge
in
front
of
jack
a
perfume
at
once
assailed
the
atmosphere
miss
nugent
sat
dazed
at
his
impudence
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
doubts
as
to
her
father
capacity
stirred
within
her
she
attempted
the
poor
consolation
of
an
tablet
and
it
was
at
once
impounded
by
the
watchful
kingdom
the
reek
of
was
insufferable
the
service
seemed
interminable
and
all
that
time
the
indignant
damsel
wedged
in
between
her
aunt
and
the
openly
exultant
enemy
of
her
house
was
compelled
to
endure
in
silence
she
did
indeed
attempt
one
remark
and
master
hardy
with
a
horrified
expression
of
outraged
piety
said
and
shook
his
head
at
her
it
was
almost
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
and
when
the
unobservant
kingdom
asked
her
for
the
text
on
the
way
home
her
reply
nearly
cost
her
the
loss
of
her
dinner
the
conqueror
under
its
new
commander
sailed
on
the
day
following
wilks
watched
it
from
the
quay
and
the
new
steward
observing
him
came
to
the
side
and
holding
aloft
an
old
between
his
finger
and
thumb
until
he
had
attracted
his
attention
dropped
it
overboard
with
every
circumstance
of
exaggerated
horror
by
the
time
a
suitable
retort
had
occurred
to
the
the
steamer
was
half
a
mile
distant
and
the
extraordinary
and
unnatural
pantomime
in
which
he
indulged
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
was
grievously
misinterpreted
by
a
nervous
man
in
a
sailing
boat
master
hardy
had
also
seen
the
ship
out
and
perched
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
breakwater
he
remained
watching
until
she
was
hull
down
on
the
horizon
then
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
town
and
the
nearest
confectioner
and
started
for
home
just
as
miss
nugent
who
was
about
to
pay
a
call
with
her
aunt
waited
beautifully
dressed
in
the
front
garden
while
that
lady
completed
her
preparations
feeling
very
spic
and
span
and
still
a
trifle
uncomfortable
from
the
vigorous
attentions
of
ann
who
cleansed
her
as
though
she
had
been
a
doorstep
she
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
path
upon
these
occasions
of
high
dress
a
spirit
of
sabbath
calm
was
wont
to
descend
upon
her
and
save
her
from
escapades
to
which
in
a
less
severe
garb
she
was
somewhat
prone
she
stopped
at
the
gate
and
looked
up
the
road
then
her
face
flushed
and
she
cast
her
eyes
behind
her
to
make
sure
that
the
stood
open
the
hated
scion
of
the
house
of
hardy
was
coming
down
the
road
and
in
view
of
that
fact
she
forgot
all
else
even
her
manners
the
boy
still
fresh
from
the
loss
of
his
natural
protector
kept
a
wary
eye
on
the
house
as
he
approached
then
all
expression
died
out
of
his
face
and
he
passed
the
gate
blankly
ignoring
the
small
girl
who
was
leaning
over
it
and
apparently
suffering
from
elephantiasis
of
the
tongue
he
went
by
quietly
and
miss
nugent
raging
inwardly
that
she
had
misbehaved
to
no
purpose
withdrew
her
tongue
for
more
legitimate
uses
she
cried
had
his
hair
pulled
master
hardy
pursued
the
even
tenor
of
his
way
afraid
to
answer
me
for
fear
my
father
will
thrash
him
cried
the
disappointed
lady
raising
her
voice
this
was
too
much
the
enemy
retraced
his
steps
and
came
up
to
the
gate
a
rude
little
girl
he
said
with
an
insufferably
air
had
his
hair
pulled
demanded
miss
nugent
capering
wildly
had
his
hair
pulled
be
silly
said
master
hardy
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
producing
some
nuts
offered
them
over
the
gate
at
this
miss
nugent
ceased
her
capering
and
wrath
possessed
her
that
the
enemy
should
thus
misunderstand
the
gravity
of
the
situation
give
to
jack
then
pursued
the
boy
wo
say
this
was
a
distinct
reflection
on
jack
loyalty
and
her
indignation
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
she
knew
it
was
true
away
from
our
gate
she
stormed
my
father
catches
you
you
said
the
he
looked
up
at
the
house
and
then
opening
the
gate
strode
boldly
into
the
front
garden
before
this
intrusion
miss
nugent
retreated
in
alarm
and
gaining
the
gazed
at
him
in
dismay
then
her
face
cleared
suddenly
and
master
hardy
looking
over
his
shoulder
saw
that
his
retreat
was
cut
off
by
wilks
let
him
hurt
me
sam
entreated
miss
nugent
piteously
wilks
came
into
the
garden
and
closed
the
gate
behind
him
was
going
to
hurt
her
cried
master
hardy
anxiously
if
i
should
hurt
a
girl
are
you
doing
in
our
front
garden
then
demanded
wilks
he
sprang
forward
suddenly
and
catching
the
boy
by
the
collar
with
one
huge
hand
dragged
him
struggling
violently
down
the
into
the
back
garden
miss
nugent
following
close
behind
sought
to
improve
the
occasion
what
you
get
by
coming
into
our
garden
she
said
the
victim
made
no
reply
he
was
writhing
strenuously
in
order
to
frustrate
wilks
evident
desire
to
arrange
him
comfortably
for
the
administration
of
the
stick
he
was
carrying
satisfied
at
last
the
raised
his
weapon
and
for
some
seconds
plied
it
briskly
miss
nugent
trembled
but
sternly
repressing
sympathy
for
the
sufferer
was
pleased
that
the
long
arm
of
justice
had
at
last
him
him
go
now
sam
she
said
not
yelled
master
hardy
frantically
can
see
the
tears
declared
miss
nugent
bending
wilks
plied
the
rod
again
until
his
victim
with
a
sudden
turn
fetched
him
a
violent
kick
on
the
shin
and
broke
loose
the
set
off
in
pursuit
somewhat
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
he
dare
not
go
over
whilst
master
hardy
was
singularly
free
from
such
prejudices
miss
nugent
ran
to
the
to
cut
off
his
retreat
she
was
willing
for
him
to
be
released
but
not
to
escape
and
so
it
fell
out
that
the
boy
dodging
beneath
wilks
outspread
arms
charged
blindly
up
the
and
bowled
the
young
lady
over
there
was
a
shrill
squeal
a
flutter
of
white
and
a
neat
pair
of
button
boots
waving
in
the
air
then
miss
nugent
sobbing
piteously
rose
from
the
puddle
into
which
she
had
fallen
and
surveyed
her
garments
wilks
surveyed
them
too
and
a
very
cursory
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
him
that
the
case
was
beyond
his
powers
he
took
the
outraged
damsel
by
the
hand
and
led
her
howling
lustily
in
to
the
horrified
ann
word
said
she
gasping
at
your
gloves
look
at
your
frock
but
miss
nugent
was
looking
at
her
knees
there
was
only
a
slight
redness
about
the
left
but
from
the
right
a
piece
of
skin
was
indubitably
missing
this
knee
she
gave
ann
instructions
to
foment
with
fair
water
of
a
comfortable
temperature
indulging
in
satisfied
prognostications
as
to
the
fate
of
master
hardy
when
her
father
should
see
the
damage
the
news
when
the
captain
came
home
was
broken
to
him
by
degrees
he
was
first
shown
the
by
ann
then
kingdom
brought
in
various
soiled
garments
and
at
the
psychological
moment
his
daughter
bared
her
knees
will
you
do
to
him
father
she
inquired
the
captain
ignored
the
question
in
favour
of
a
few
remarks
on
the
subject
of
his
daughter
behaviour
coupled
with
stern
inquiries
as
to
where
she
learnt
such
tricks
in
reply
miss
nugent
sheltered
herself
behind
a
list
which
contained
the
names
of
all
the
young
gentlemen
who
attended
her
kindergarten
class
and
many
of
the
young
ladies
and
again
inquired
as
to
the
fate
of
her
assailant
jack
came
in
soon
after
and
the
indefatigable
miss
nugent
produced
her
knees
again
she
had
to
describe
the
injury
to
the
left
but
the
right
spoke
for
itself
jack
gazed
at
it
with
indignation
and
then
without
waiting
for
his
tea
put
on
his
cap
and
sallied
out
again
he
returned
an
hour
later
and
instead
of
entering
the
went
straight
upstairs
to
bed
from
whence
he
sent
down
word
by
the
sympathetic
ann
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
bad
headache
which
he
proposed
to
treat
with
raw
meat
applied
to
the
left
eye
his
nose
which
was
apparently
suffering
from
sympathetic
inflammation
he
left
to
take
care
of
itself
that
organ
bitterly
resenting
any
treatment
whatsoever
he
described
the
battle
to
kate
and
ann
the
next
day
darkly
ascribing
his
defeat
to
a
mysterious
compound
which
jem
hardy
was
believed
to
rub
into
his
arms
to
a
foolish
error
of
judgment
at
the
beginning
of
the
fray
and
to
the
sun
which
shone
persistently
in
his
eyes
all
the
time
his
audience
received
the
explanations
in
chilly
silence
he
said
it
was
an
accident
he
knocked
you
down
he
concluded
said
he
hoped
you
were
hurt
and
he
gave
me
some
toffee
for
did
you
do
with
it
demanded
miss
nugent
knew
you
would
have
it
replied
her
brother
inconsequently
there
was
much
of
his
sister
regarded
him
sharply
do
mean
to
say
you
ate
it
she
screamed
not
demanded
her
brother
wanted
comforting
i
can
tell
wonder
you
were
not
too
too
proud
said
miss
nugent
bitterly
never
too
proud
to
eat
toffee
retorted
jack
simply
he
stalked
off
in
dudgeon
at
the
lack
of
sympathy
displayed
by
his
audience
and
being
still
in
need
of
comforting
sought
it
amid
the
his
father
noted
his
son
honourable
scars
but
made
no
comment
as
to
any
action
on
his
own
part
he
realized
to
the
full
the
impotence
of
a
and
dignified
citizen
when
confronted
by
lawless
youth
but
master
hardy
came
to
church
no
more
indeed
the
following
sunday
he
was
fully
occupied
on
the
beach
enacting
the
part
of
david
after
first
impressing
the
raving
wilks
into
that
of
goliath
chapter
iv
for
the
next
month
or
two
master
hardy
existence
was
brightened
by
the
efforts
of
an
elderly
steward
who
made
no
secret
of
his
intentions
of
putting
an
end
to
it
wilks
at
first
placed
great
reliance
on
the
saw
that
is
the
early
bird
that
catches
the
worm
but
lost
faith
in
it
when
he
found
that
it
made
no
provision
for
cases
in
which
the
worm
leaning
from
its
bedroom
window
addressed
spirited
remonstrances
to
the
bird
on
the
subject
of
its
personal
appearance
to
the
anxious
inquiries
of
miss
nugent
wilks
replied
that
he
was
biding
his
time
every
delay
he
hinted
made
it
worse
for
master
hardy
when
the
day
of
retribution
should
dawn
and
although
she
pleaded
earnestly
for
a
little
on
account
he
was
unable
to
meet
her
wishes
before
that
day
came
however
captain
nugent
heard
of
the
proceedings
and
after
a
painful
interview
with
the
steward
during
which
the
latter
failings
by
no
means
escaped
attention
confined
him
to
the
house
an
excellent
reason
for
absenting
himself
from
school
was
thus
denied
to
master
hardy
but
it
has
been
well
said
that
when
one
door
closes
another
opens
and
to
his
great
satisfaction
the
old
servant
who
had
been
in
poor
health
for
some
time
suddenly
took
to
her
bed
and
required
his
undivided
attention
he
treated
her
at
first
with
patent
medicines
purchased
at
the
chemist
a
doctor
being
regarded
by
both
of
them
as
a
piece
of
unnecessary
extravagance
but
in
spite
of
four
infallible
remedies
she
got
steadily
worse
then
a
doctor
was
called
in
and
by
the
time
captain
hardy
returned
home
she
had
made
a
partial
recovery
but
was
clearly
incapable
of
further
work
she
left
in
a
cab
to
accept
a
home
with
a
niece
leaving
the
captain
confronted
with
a
problem
which
he
had
seen
growing
for
some
time
past
ca
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
with
you
he
observed
regarding
his
son
very
comfortable
was
the
reply
too
comfortable
said
his
father
running
wild
it
just
as
well
poor
old
martha
has
gone
it
has
brought
things
to
a
could
have
somebody
else
suggested
his
son
the
captain
shook
his
head
give
up
the
house
and
send
you
to
london
to
your
aunt
mary
he
said
slowly
does
know
you
and
once
i
at
sea
and
the
house
given
up
she
wo
be
able
to
send
you
master
hardy
who
was
much
averse
to
leaving
sunwich
and
had
heard
accounts
of
the
lady
in
question
which
referred
principally
to
her
strength
of
mind
made
tender
inquiries
concerning
his
father
comfort
while
ashore
take
rooms
was
the
reply
i
shall
spend
as
much
time
as
i
can
with
you
in
london
you
want
looking
after
my
son
i
heard
all
about
his
son
without
inquiring
as
to
the
nature
of
the
information
denied
it
at
once
upon
principle
he
also
alluded
darkly
to
his
education
and
shook
his
head
over
the
effects
of
a
change
at
such
a
critical
period
of
his
existence
you
talk
too
much
for
your
age
was
his
father
comment
when
he
had
finished
year
or
two
with
your
aunt
ought
to
make
a
nice
boy
of
you
there
plenty
of
room
for
he
put
his
plans
in
hand
at
once
and
a
week
before
he
sailed
again
had
disposed
of
the
house
some
of
the
furniture
he
kept
for
himself
but
the
bulk
of
it
went
to
his
sister
as
master
hardy
in
very
low
spirits
watched
it
taken
away
big
men
in
boots
ran
noisily
up
the
bare
stairs
and
came
down
slowly
steering
large
pieces
of
furniture
through
narrow
passages
and
using
much
vain
repetition
when
they
found
their
hands
acting
as
fenders
the
wardrobe
a
piece
of
furniture
which
had
been
built
for
larger
premises
was
a
particularly
hard
nut
to
crack
but
they
succeeded
at
last
in
three
places
a
few
of
his
intimates
came
down
to
see
the
last
of
him
and
miss
nugent
who
in
some
feminine
fashion
regarded
the
move
as
a
triumph
for
her
family
passed
by
several
times
it
might
have
been
chance
it
might
have
been
design
but
the
boy
could
not
help
noticing
that
when
the
piano
the
wardrobe
and
other
fine
pieces
were
being
placed
in
the
van
she
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
road
a
position
from
which
such
curios
as
a
broken
washstand
or
a
chair
never
failed
to
entice
her
it
was
over
at
last
the
second
van
had
disappeared
and
nothing
was
left
but
a
litter
of
straw
and
paper
the
front
door
stood
open
and
revealed
desolation
miss
nugent
came
to
the
gate
and
stared
in
superciliously
glad
you
going
she
said
frankly
master
hardy
scarcely
noticed
her
one
of
his
friends
who
concealed
strong
business
instincts
beneath
a
sentimental
exterior
had
suggested
souvenirs
and
given
him
a
said
to
have
belonged
to
henry
and
he
was
busy
searching
his
pockets
for
an
adequate
return
then
captain
hardy
came
up
and
first
going
over
the
empty
house
came
out
and
bade
his
son
accompany
him
to
the
station
a
minute
or
two
later
and
they
were
out
of
sight
the
sentimentalist
stood
on
the
curb
gloating
over
a
newly
acquired
penknife
and
miss
nugent
after
being
strongly
reproved
by
him
for
curiosity
paced
slowly
home
with
her
head
in
the
air
sunwich
made
no
stir
over
the
departure
of
one
of
its
youthful
citizens
indeed
it
lacked
not
those
who
would
have
cheerfully
parted
with
two
or
three
hundred
more
the
boy
was
quite
chilled
by
the
tameness
of
his
exit
and
for
years
afterwards
the
desolate
appearance
of
the
platform
as
the
train
steamed
out
occurred
to
him
with
an
odd
sense
of
discomfort
in
all
sunwich
there
was
only
one
person
who
grieved
over
his
departure
and
he
after
keeping
his
memory
green
for
two
years
wrote
off
fivepence
as
a
bad
debt
and
dismissed
him
from
his
thoughts
two
months
after
the
conqueror
had
sailed
again
captain
nugent
obtained
command
of
a
steamer
sailing
between
london
and
the
chinese
ports
from
the
gratified
lips
of
wilks
sunwich
heard
of
this
new
craft
the
particular
glory
of
which
appeared
to
be
the
luxurious
appointments
of
the
steward
quarters
language
indeed
failed
wilks
in
describing
it
and
pressed
for
details
he
could
only
murmur
disjointedly
of
polished
brass
and
crimson
velvet
jack
nugent
hailed
his
father
departure
with
joy
they
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
each
other
during
the
latter
prolonged
stay
ashore
and
neither
had
risen
in
the
other
estimation
in
consequence
he
became
enthusiastic
over
the
sea
as
a
profession
for
fathers
and
gave
himself
some
airs
over
acquaintances
less
fortunately
placed
in
the
first
flush
of
liberty
he
took
to
staying
away
from
school
the
education
thus
lost
being
only
partially
atoned
for
by
a
style
of
composition
engendered
by
dictating
excuses
to
the
kingdom
at
seventeen
he
learnt
somewhat
to
his
surprise
that
his
education
was
finished
his
father
provided
the
information
and
simply
as
a
matter
of
form
consulted
him
as
to
his
views
for
the
future
it
was
an
important
thing
to
decide
upon
at
short
notice
but
he
was
equal
to
it
and
having
suggested
as
the
only
profession
he
cared
for
was
promptly
provided
by
the
incensed
captain
with
a
stool
in
the
local
bank
he
occupied
it
for
three
weeks
a
period
of
time
which
coincided
to
a
day
with
his
father
leave
ashore
he
left
behind
him
his
initials
cut
deeply
in
the
lid
of
his
desk
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
cheap
fiction
and
a
few
experiments
in
which
the
manager
ultimately
solved
with
red
ink
and
a
ruler
a
slight
uneasiness
as
to
the
wisdom
of
his
proceedings
occurred
to
him
just
before
his
father
return
but
he
comforted
himself
and
kate
with
the
undeniable
truth
that
after
all
the
captain
could
eat
him
he
was
afraid
however
that
the
latter
would
be
displeased
and
with
a
constitutional
objection
to
unpleasantness
he
contrived
to
be
out
when
he
returned
leaving
to
kingdom
the
task
of
breaking
the
news
the
captain
reply
was
brief
and
to
the
point
he
asked
his
son
whether
he
would
like
to
go
to
sea
and
upon
receiving
a
decided
answer
in
the
negative
at
once
took
steps
to
send
him
there
in
two
days
he
had
procured
him
an
outfit
and
within
a
week
jack
nugent
greatly
to
his
own
surprise
was
on
the
way
to
melbourne
as
apprentice
on
the
barque
silver
stream
he
liked
it
even
less
than
the
bank
the
monotony
of
the
sea
was
appalling
to
a
youth
of
his
tastes
and
the
fact
that
the
skipper
a
man
who
never
spoke
except
to
find
fault
was
almost
loquacious
with
him
failed
to
afford
him
any
satisfaction
he
liked
the
mates
no
better
than
the
skipper
and
having
said
as
much
one
day
to
the
second
officer
had
no
reason
afterwards
to
modify
his
opinions
he
lived
a
life
apart
and
except
for
the
cook
another
martyr
to
had
no
society
in
these
uncongenial
circumstances
the
new
apprentice
worked
for
four
months
as
he
had
never
believed
it
possible
he
could
work
he
was
annoyed
both
at
the
extent
and
the
variety
of
his
tasks
the
work
of
an
being
gratuitously
included
in
his
curriculum
the
end
of
the
voyage
found
him
desperate
and
after
a
hasty
consultation
with
the
cook
they
deserted
together
and
went
letters
dealing
mainly
with
the
ideas
and
adventures
of
the
cook
reached
sunwich
at
irregular
intervals
and
were
eagerly
perused
by
kingdom
and
kate
but
the
captain
forbade
all
mention
of
him
then
they
ceased
altogether
and
after
a
year
or
two
of
unbroken
silence
kingdom
asserted
herself
and
a
photograph
in
her
possession
the
only
one
extant
exposing
the
missing
jack
in
petticoats
and
sash
suddenly
appeared
on
the
mantelpiece
the
captain
stared
but
made
no
comment
disappointed
in
his
son
he
turned
for
consolation
to
his
daughter
noting
with
some
concern
the
unaccountable
changes
which
that
young
lady
underwent
during
his
absences
he
noticed
a
difference
after
every
voyage
he
left
behind
him
on
one
occasion
a
nice
trim
little
girl
and
returned
to
find
a
creature
all
legs
and
arms
he
returned
again
and
found
the
arms
less
obnoxious
and
the
legs
hidden
by
a
long
skirt
and
as
he
complained
in
secret
astonishment
to
his
sister
she
had
developed
a
motherly
manner
in
her
dealings
with
him
which
was
almost
unbearable
grow
out
of
it
soon
said
kingdom
wait
and
the
captain
growled
and
waited
and
found
his
sister
prognostications
partly
fulfilled
the
exuberance
of
miss
nugent
manner
was
certainly
modified
by
time
but
she
developed
instead
a
quiet
unassuming
habit
of
authority
which
he
liked
as
little
gets
made
such
a
fuss
of
it
no
wonder
said
kingdom
with
a
satisfied
smile
never
heard
of
a
girl
getting
as
much
attention
as
she
does
it
a
wonder
her
head
is
said
the
startled
captain
better
not
let
me
see
anything
of
so
said
kingdom
the
captain
dwelt
on
these
words
and
kept
his
eyes
open
and
owing
to
his
daughter
benevolent
efforts
on
his
behalf
had
them
fully
occupied
he
went
to
sea
firmly
convinced
that
she
would
do
something
foolish
in
the
matrimonial
line
the
glowing
terms
in
which
he
had
overheard
her
describing
the
charms
of
the
new
postman
to
kingdom
filling
him
with
the
direst
forebodings
it
was
his
last
voyage
an
unexpected
windfall
from
an
almost
forgotten
uncle
and
his
own
investments
had
placed
him
in
a
position
of
modest
comfort
and
just
before
miss
nugent
reached
her
twentieth
birthday
he
resolved
to
spend
his
declining
days
ashore
and
give
her
those
advantages
of
parental
attention
from
which
she
had
been
so
long
debarred
wilks
to
the
inconsolable
grief
of
his
left
with
him
he
had
been
for
nearly
a
couple
of
years
in
receipt
of
an
annuity
purchased
for
him
under
the
will
of
his
mother
and
his
defection
left
a
gap
never
to
be
filled
among
comrades
who
had
for
some
time
regarded
him
in
the
light
of
an
improved
drinking
fountain
chapter
v
on
a
fine
afternoon
some
two
months
after
his
release
from
the
toils
of
the
sea
captain
nugent
sat
in
the
special
parlour
of
the
goblets
the
old
inn
offers
hospitality
to
all
but
one
parlour
has
by
ancient
tradition
and
the
exercise
of
and
proper
feeling
been
from
time
immemorial
reserved
for
the
elite
of
the
town
the
captain
confident
in
the
security
of
these
unwritten
regulations
conversed
freely
with
his
peers
he
had
been
moved
to
speech
by
the
utter
absence
of
discipline
ashore
and
from
that
had
wandered
to
the
growing
evil
of
revolutionary
ideas
at
sea
his
remarks
were
much
applauded
and
two
listened
with
grave
respect
to
a
disquisition
on
the
wrongs
of
shipmasters
ensuing
on
the
fancied
rights
of
sailor
men
the
only
discordant
note
being
struck
by
the
a
man
whose
ideas
had
probably
been
insidiously
sapped
by
a
long
residence
ashore
man
before
the
mast
said
the
latter
fortifying
his
moral
courage
with
whisky
a
human
denies
it
said
captain
nugent
looking
round
one
captain
agreed
with
him
do
they
act
like
it
then
demanded
the
other
nugent
and
the
first
captain
struck
by
the
remark
thought
they
had
perhaps
been
too
hasty
in
their
admission
and
waited
for
number
two
to
continue
they
eyed
him
with
silent
encouragement
do
they
act
like
it
then
repeated
number
two
who
being
a
man
of
few
ideas
was
not
disposed
to
waste
them
captain
nugent
and
his
friend
turned
to
the
to
see
how
he
would
meet
this
poser
mostly
do
he
replied
sturdily
a
seaman
well
and
he
treat
you
this
was
rank
heresy
and
moreover
seemed
to
imply
something
captain
nugent
wondered
dismally
whether
life
ashore
would
infect
him
with
the
same
opinions
about
that
man
of
mine
who
threw
a
at
me
the
quailed
at
the
challenge
the
obvious
retort
was
offensive
shall
carry
the
mark
with
me
to
my
grave
added
the
captain
as
a
further
inducement
to
him
to
reply
hope
that
you
carry
it
a
long
time
said
the
gracefully
look
here
hall
expostulated
captain
number
two
starting
up
all
right
cooper
said
nugent
all
right
said
captain
number
one
and
in
a
rash
moment
undertook
to
explain
in
five
minutes
he
had
clouded
captain
cooper
intellect
for
the
afternoon
he
was
still
busy
with
his
task
when
a
diversion
was
created
by
the
entrance
of
a
new
arrival
a
short
stout
man
stood
for
a
moment
with
the
handle
of
the
door
in
his
hand
and
then
came
in
carefully
bearing
before
him
a
glass
of
gin
and
water
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
set
foot
there
and
all
understood
that
by
this
intrusion
daniel
kybird
sought
to
place
and
other
dignitaries
on
a
footing
with
the
keepers
of
and
dealers
in
old
clothes
in
the
midst
of
an
impressive
silence
he
set
his
glass
upon
the
table
and
taking
a
chair
drew
a
small
clay
pipe
from
his
pocket
aghast
at
the
intrusion
the
quartette
conferred
with
their
eyes
a
language
which
is
perhaps
only
successful
in
love
captain
cooper
who
was
usually
moved
to
speech
by
externals
was
the
first
to
speak
got
a
sty
coming
on
your
eye
hall
he
remarked
anybody
got
a
needle
said
the
captain
who
loved
minor
operations
nobody
heeded
him
except
the
and
he
muttered
something
about
beams
and
motes
which
the
captain
failed
to
understand
the
others
were
glaring
darkly
at
kybird
who
had
taken
up
a
newspaper
and
was
busy
perusing
it
you
looking
for
anybody
demanded
captain
nugent
at
last
said
kybird
looking
at
him
over
the
top
of
his
paper
have
you
come
here
for
then
inquired
the
captain
come
to
drink
two
o
gin
cold
returned
kybird
with
a
dignity
befitting
the
occupation
suppose
you
drink
it
somewhere
else
suggested
the
captain
kybird
had
another
supposition
to
offer
i
do
he
remarked
a
british
tradesman
and
my
money
is
as
good
as
yours
i
as
much
right
to
be
here
as
you
i
never
done
anything
i
ashamed
of
you
never
will
said
captain
cooper
friend
grimly
if
you
live
to
be
a
kybird
looked
surprised
at
the
tribute
he
said
gratefully
we
do
want
you
here
said
captain
nugent
prefer
your
room
to
your
kybird
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
twisted
his
blunt
features
into
an
expression
of
withering
contempt
then
he
took
up
a
glass
and
drank
and
discovered
too
late
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
had
made
free
with
the
speaker
whisky
apologize
interrupted
the
captain
soon
he
took
the
glass
up
gingerly
and
flung
it
with
a
crash
into
the
fireplace
then
he
rang
the
bell
smashed
a
dirty
glass
he
said
as
the
entered
much
the
man
told
him
and
the
captain
after
a
few
stern
remarks
about
privacy
and
harpies
left
the
room
with
his
friends
leaving
the
speechless
kybird
gazing
at
the
broken
glass
and
returning
evasive
replies
to
the
inquiries
of
the
curious
charles
he
finished
his
gin
and
water
slowly
for
months
he
had
been
screwing
up
his
courage
to
carry
that
room
by
assault
and
this
was
the
result
he
had
been
insulted
almost
in
the
very
face
of
charles
a
youth
whose
reputation
as
a
gossip
was
second
to
none
in
sunwich
you
know
what
i
should
do
if
i
was
you
said
that
worthy
as
he
entered
the
room
again
and
swept
up
the
broken
glass
do
not
said
kybird
with
lofty
indifference
should
come
again
that
what
i
should
do
said
charles
frankly
time
he
throw
you
in
the
said
the
heated
kybird
will
he
i
like
to
see
i
make
sorry
for
this
afore
i
done
with
i
learn
to
insult
a
respectable
british
tradesman
i
show
him
who
you
do
inquired
the
other
you
mind
said
kybird
who
was
not
in
a
position
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
you
mind
you
go
and
get
on
with
your
work
charles
and
by
the
time
your
moustache
grown
big
enough
to
be
seen
you
something
the
other
day
said
the
musingly
you
it
was
but
i
would
believe
was
it
demanded
the
other
much
replied
charles
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
i
would
believe
it
of
you
i
said
i
was
it
insisted
kybird
they
said
you
once
gave
a
man
a
fair
price
for
a
pair
of
trousers
said
the
barman
indignantly
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
softly
and
kybird
after
a
brief
pause
opened
it
again
and
more
softly
still
quitted
the
precincts
of
the
goblets
and
stepped
across
the
road
to
his
emporium
captain
nugent
in
happy
ignorance
of
the
dark
designs
of
the
wardrobe
dealer
had
also
gone
home
he
was
only
just
beginning
to
realize
the
comparative
unimportance
of
a
retired
shipmaster
and
the
knowledge
was
a
source
of
considerable
annoyance
to
him
no
deferential
mates
listened
respectfully
to
his
instructions
no
sturdy
seaman
ran
to
execute
his
commands
or
trembled
mutinously
at
his
wrath
the
only
person
in
the
wide
world
who
stood
in
awe
of
him
was
the
general
servant
bella
and
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
her
satisfaction
at
the
attention
excited
by
her
shortcomings
he
paused
a
moment
at
the
gate
and
then
walking
slowly
up
to
the
door
gave
it
the
knock
of
a
master
a
full
minute
passing
he
knocked
again
remembering
with
some
misgivings
his
stern
instructions
of
the
day
before
that
the
door
was
to
be
attended
by
the
servant
and
by
nobody
else
he
had
seen
miss
nugent
sitting
at
the
window
as
he
passed
it
but
in
the
circumstances
the
fact
gave
him
no
comfort
a
third
knock
was
followed
by
a
fourth
and
then
a
distressed
voice
upstairs
was
heard
calling
wildly
upon
the
name
of
bella
at
the
fifth
knock
the
house
shook
and
a
maid
with
her
shoulders
veiled
in
a
large
damp
towel
passed
hastily
down
the
staircase
and
slipping
the
catch
passed
more
hastily
still
upstairs
again
affording
the
indignant
captain
a
glimpse
of
a
short
striped
skirt
as
it
turned
the
landing
there
any
management
at
all
in
this
house
he
inquired
as
he
entered
the
room
was
dressing
said
miss
nugent
calmly
you
gave
orders
yesterday
that
nobody
else
was
to
open
the
else
when
she
available
qualified
her
father
eyeing
her
sharply
i
give
orders
i
expect
people
to
use
their
common
sense
why
is
my
tea
ready
it
five
clock
twenty
minutes
fast
said
kate
been
meddling
with
it
demanded
her
father
verifying
the
fact
by
his
watch
miss
nugent
shook
her
head
gained
that
since
you
regulated
it
last
night
she
said
with
a
smile
the
captain
threw
himself
into
an
and
with
one
eye
on
the
clock
waited
until
at
five
minutes
to
the
hour
by
the
right
time
a
clatter
of
crockery
sounded
from
the
kitchen
and
bella
still
damp
came
in
with
the
tray
her
eye
was
also
on
the
clock
and
she
smirked
weakly
in
the
captain
direction
as
she
saw
that
she
was
at
least
two
minutes
ahead
of
time
at
a
minute
to
the
hour
the
teapot
itself
was
on
the
tray
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
handmaiden
in
the
kitchen
was
audible
to
all
to
the
minute
john
said
kingdom
as
she
took
her
seat
at
the
tray
wonderful
how
that
girl
has
improved
since
you
been
at
home
she
is
like
the
same
she
raised
the
teapot
and
after
pouring
out
a
little
of
the
contents
put
it
down
again
and
gave
it
another
two
minutes
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
colour
being
of
the
same
unsatisfactory
paleness
she
set
the
pot
down
and
was
about
to
raise
the
lid
when
an
avalanche
burst
into
the
room
and
emptying
some
tea
into
the
pot
from
a
beat
a
hasty
retreat
tea
and
servants
muttered
the
captain
to
his
plate
more
can
a
man
want
kingdom
coughed
and
passed
his
cup
miss
nugent
who
possessed
a
healthy
appetite
serenely
attacked
her
bread
and
butter
conversation
languished
suppose
you
heard
the
news
john
said
his
sister
daresay
i
have
was
the
reply
he
should
come
back
after
all
these
years
said
kingdom
to
be
sure
i
do
know
why
he
should
it
his
native
place
and
his
father
lives
are
you
talking
about
inquired
the
captain
james
hardy
replied
his
sister
thought
you
said
you
had
heard
he
coming
back
to
sunwich
and
going
into
partnership
with
old
swann
the
shipbroker
a
very
good
thing
for
him
i
should
not
interested
in
the
doings
of
the
hardys
said
the
captain
gruffly
sure
i
not
said
his
sister
defensively
captain
nugent
proceeded
with
his
meal
in
silence
his
hatred
of
hardy
had
not
been
lessened
by
the
success
which
had
attended
that
gentleman
career
and
was
not
likely
to
be
improved
by
the
of
hardy
junior
he
passed
his
cup
for
some
more
tea
and
with
a
furtive
glance
at
the
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
wondered
what
had
happened
to
his
own
son
do
suppose
i
should
know
him
if
i
saw
him
continued
kingdom
addressing
a
respectable
old
is
sure
to
have
changed
this
inquired
the
captain
looking
up
from
his
plate
why
said
kingdom
only
wanted
information
said
her
brother
as
he
deposited
the
salad
in
question
in
the
kingdom
with
a
resigned
expression
tried
to
catch
her
niece
eye
and
caught
the
captain
instead
miss
nugent
happening
to
glance
up
saw
her
fascinated
by
the
basilisk
glare
of
the
master
of
the
house
more
tea
please
she
said
her
aunt
took
her
cup
and
in
gratitude
for
the
diversion
picked
out
the
largest
lumps
of
sugar
in
the
basin
changes
so
many
people
mused
the
persevering
lady
stirring
her
tea
noticed
it
before
why
it
is
i
ca
say
but
the
fact
remains
it
seems
to
improve
them
altogether
i
dare
say
that
young
hardy
you
understand
that
i
wo
have
the
hardys
mentiond
in
my
house
said
the
captain
looking
up
not
interested
in
their
business
and
i
will
not
have
it
discussed
you
please
john
said
his
sister
drawing
herself
up
your
house
and
you
are
master
here
i
sure
i
do
want
to
discuss
them
nothing
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
you
understand
what
your
father
says
kate
said
miss
nugent
the
desire
to
talk
about
the
hardys
becomes
irresistible
we
must
go
for
a
the
captain
turned
in
his
chair
and
regarded
his
daughter
steadily
she
met
his
gaze
with
calm
affection
wish
you
were
a
boy
he
growled
the
only
man
in
sunwich
who
wishes
that
said
miss
nugent
complacently
i
do
believe
you
mean
it
if
you
come
a
little
closer
i
put
my
head
on
your
shoulder
and
convert
said
kingdom
reprovingly
talking
about
heads
said
miss
nugent
briskly
me
that
i
want
a
new
hat
you
need
look
like
that
daughters
always
come
she
moved
her
chair
a
couple
of
inches
in
his
direction
and
smiled
alluringly
the
captain
shifted
uneasily
prudence
counselled
flight
but
dignity
forbade
it
he
stared
hard
at
kingdom
and
a
smile
of
rare
appreciation
on
that
lady
face
endeavoured
to
fade
slowly
and
naturally
into
another
expression
the
chair
came
nearer
be
foolish
said
the
captain
gruffly
the
chair
came
still
nearer
until
at
last
it
touched
his
and
then
miss
nugent
with
a
sigh
of
exaggerated
content
allowed
her
head
to
sink
gracefully
on
his
shoulder
comfortable
shoulder
in
sunwich
she
murmured
and
try
the
other
aunt
and
perhaps
you
get
a
new
kingdom
hastened
to
reassure
her
brother
she
would
almost
as
soon
have
thought
of
putting
her
head
on
the
block
at
the
same
time
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
was
taking
a
mild
joy
in
his
discomfiture
and
eagerly
awaiting
further
developments
you
are
tired
of
this
childish
behaviour
miss
said
the
captain
stiffly
there
was
a
pause
said
kingdom
in
tones
of
mild
reproof
can
you
good
said
the
captain
we
see
who
gets
tired
of
it
first
in
no
a
delicate
but
unmistakable
snore
rose
from
his
shoulder
in
reply
chapter
vi
for
the
first
few
days
after
his
return
sunwich
was
full
of
surprises
to
jem
hardy
the
town
itself
had
changed
but
little
and
the
older
inhabitants
were
for
the
most
part
easily
recognisable
but
time
had
wrought
wonders
among
the
younger
members
of
the
population
small
boys
had
attained
to
whiskered
manhood
and
small
girls
passing
into
young
women
had
in
some
cases
even
changed
their
names
the
most
astounding
and
gratifying
instance
of
the
wonders
effected
by
time
was
that
of
miss
nugent
he
saw
her
first
at
the
window
and
with
a
ready
recognition
of
the
enchantment
lent
by
distance
took
the
first
possible
opportunity
of
a
closer
observation
he
then
realized
the
enchantment
afforded
by
proximity
the
second
opportunity
led
him
impetuously
into
a
draper
shop
where
a
magnificent
after
first
ceremoniously
handing
him
a
high
cane
chair
passed
on
his
order
for
pins
in
a
deep
and
thrilling
baritone
and
retired
in
good
order
by
the
end
of
a
week
his
observations
were
completed
and
kate
nugent
securely
enthroned
in
his
mind
as
the
incarnation
of
feminine
grace
and
beauty
left
but
little
room
for
other
matters
on
his
second
sunday
at
home
to
his
father
great
surprise
he
attended
church
and
after
contemplating
miss
nugent
back
hair
for
an
hour
and
a
half
came
home
and
spoke
eloquently
and
nobly
on
hatchets
old
sores
bygones
be
bygones
and
kindred
topics
never
take
much
notice
of
sermons
myself
said
the
captain
misunderstanding
said
his
son
was
thinking
of
the
sermon
but
i
saw
captain
nugent
there
and
i
remembered
the
stupid
quarrel
between
you
it
absurd
that
it
should
go
on
what
does
it
matter
inquired
the
other
staring
should
it
perhaps
it
the
music
that
affected
you
some
of
those
old
hymns
was
the
sermon
and
it
was
the
hymns
said
his
son
disdainfully
just
common
sense
it
seems
to
me
that
the
enmity
between
you
has
lasted
long
do
see
that
it
matters
said
the
captain
does
hurt
me
nugent
goes
his
way
and
i
go
mine
but
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
at
the
old
man
he
better
look
out
he
wants
a
little
of
the
starch
taken
out
of
mannerism
said
his
son
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
his
girl
takes
after
him
said
the
innocent
captain
the
way
she
grown
up
a
very
girl
you
take
a
look
at
her
the
next
time
you
see
his
son
stared
at
him
get
married
soon
i
should
think
continued
the
other
murchison
the
new
doctor
here
seems
to
be
the
favourite
nugent
is
backing
him
so
they
say
i
wish
him
joy
of
his
jem
hardy
took
his
pipe
into
the
garden
and
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
the
narrow
paths
determined
at
any
costs
to
save
murchison
from
such
a
and
kate
nugent
from
any
husband
except
of
his
choosing
he
took
a
seat
under
an
old
apple
tree
and
musing
in
the
twilight
tried
in
vain
to
think
of
ways
and
means
of
making
her
acquaintance
meantime
they
passed
each
other
as
strangers
and
the
difficulty
of
approaching
her
only
made
the
task
more
alluring
in
the
second
week
he
reckoned
up
that
he
had
seen
her
nine
times
it
was
a
satisfactory
total
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
five
times
out
of
that
number
he
had
seen
murchison
as
well
and
neither
of
them
appeared
to
have
seen
him
he
sat
thinking
it
over
in
the
office
one
hot
afternoon
adolphus
swann
his
partner
had
just
returned
from
lunch
and
for
about
the
fifth
time
that
day
was
arranging
his
white
hair
and
short
neatly
pointed
beard
in
a
small
over
the
top
of
it
he
glanced
at
hardy
who
leaning
back
in
his
chair
bit
his
pen
and
stared
hard
at
a
paper
before
him
that
the
manifest
of
the
north
star
he
inquired
was
the
reply
swann
put
his
away
and
watched
the
other
as
he
crossed
over
to
the
window
and
gazed
through
the
small
dirty
panes
at
the
bustling
life
of
the
harbour
below
for
a
short
time
hardy
stood
gazing
in
silence
and
then
suddenly
crossing
the
room
took
his
hat
from
a
peg
and
went
out
said
the
senior
partner
wiping
his
folders
with
great
care
and
putting
them
on
where
he
put
that
he
went
over
to
the
other
desk
and
opened
a
drawer
to
search
for
it
just
inside
was
a
sheet
of
foolscap
and
swann
with
growing
astonishment
slowly
mastered
the
contents
her
as
often
as
to
know
some
of
her
and
get
hold
of
the
old
out
her
tastes
and
my
hand
before
murchison
has
it
all
his
own
seems
to
me
said
the
bewildered
shipbroker
carefully
replacing
the
paper
my
young
friend
is
looking
out
for
another
partner
he
has
lost
much
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
resumed
his
work
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
to
let
his
partner
know
what
he
had
seen
and
when
hardy
returned
he
had
barely
seated
himself
before
swann
with
a
mysterious
smile
crossed
over
to
him
bearing
a
sheet
of
foolscap
and
dress
as
well
as
my
partner
read
the
astonished
hardy
the
matter
with
my
clothes
what
do
you
mean
swann
in
place
of
answering
returned
to
his
desk
and
taking
up
another
sheet
of
foolscap
began
to
write
again
holding
up
his
hand
for
silence
as
hardy
repeated
his
question
when
he
had
finished
his
task
he
brought
it
over
and
placed
it
in
the
other
hand
her
little
brother
out
for
hardy
crumpled
the
paper
up
and
flung
it
aside
then
with
his
face
crimson
he
stared
wrathfully
at
the
benevolent
swann
the
safest
card
in
the
pack
said
the
latter
please
everybody
especially
the
little
brother
you
should
always
hold
his
hand
it
looks
well
for
one
thing
and
if
you
shut
your
eyes
do
want
any
of
your
nonsense
said
the
maddened
jem
do
you
mean
by
reading
my
private
papers
came
over
to
look
for
the
manifest
said
swann
i
read
it
before
i
could
make
out
what
it
was
you
must
admit
it
a
bit
cryptic
i
thought
it
was
a
new
game
at
first
getting
hold
of
the
old
lady
sounds
like
a
sort
of
buff
but
why
not
get
hold
of
the
young
one
why
waste
time
over
to
the
devil
said
the
junior
partner
more
suggestions
i
can
give
you
you
are
heartily
welcome
to
said
swann
going
back
to
his
seat
my
vast
experience
is
at
your
service
and
the
best
and
sweetest
and
prettiest
girls
in
sunwich
regard
me
as
a
sort
of
second
a
second
father
inquired
jim
looking
up

your
own
way
said
the
other
wash
my
hands
of
you
you
not
in
earnest
or
you
clutch
at
any
straw
but
let
me
give
you
one
word
of
advice
be
careful
how
you
get
hold
of
the
old
lady
let
her
understand
from
the
commencement
that
it
is
hardy
went
on
with
his
work
there
was
a
pile
of
it
in
front
of
him
and
an
accumulation
in
his
drawers
for
some
time
he
wrote
assiduously
but
work
was
dry
after
the
subject
they
had
been
discussing
he
looked
over
at
his
partner
and
seeing
that
that
gentleman
was
gravely
busy
reopened
the
matter
with
a
jeer
maids
always
know
most
about
rearing
children
he
remarked
i
suppose
old
bachelors
looking
down
on
life
from
the
top
shelf
think
they
know
most
about
wash
my
hands
of
you
repeated
the
senior
placidly
am
not
to
be
taunted
into
rendering
first
aid
to
the
the
junior
lost
his
presence
of
mind
trying
to
taunt
you
he
demanded
hotly
you
do
more
harm
than
a
bandage
round
the
head
instead
of
the
heart
i
expect
assented
the
chuckling
swann
shelf
i
think
you
said
well
i
climbed
there
for
must
have
been
much
run
after
said
his
partner
was
said
the
other
suppose
that
why
it
is
i
am
always
so
interested
in
these
affairs
i
have
helped
to
marry
so
many
people
in
this
place
that
i
almost
afraid
to
stir
out
after
hardy
reply
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
edward
silk
a
young
man
of
forlorn
aspect
who
combined
in
his
person
the
offices
of
messenger
cleaner
and
to
the
firm
he
brought
in
some
letters
and
placing
them
on
swann
desk
retired
another

the
latter

the
door
closed
complaint
is
amelia

and
he
got
it
badly
she
big
enough
to
eat
him
but
i
believe
that
they
are
engaged
perseverance
has
done
it
in
his
case
he
used
to
go
about
like
a
blighted
flower
am
rather
busy
his
partner
reminded
him
swann
sighed
and
resumed
his
own
labours
for
some
time
both
men
wrote
in
silence
then
the
elder
suddenly
put
his
pen
down
and
hit
his
desk
a
noisy
thump
with
his
fist
got
it
he
said
briskly
humbly
for
all
your
candour
and
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
information
which
shall
brighten
your
dull
eyes
raise
the
corners
of
your
drooping
mouth
and
renew
once
more
the
pink
and
cream
in
your
youthful
here
said
the
overwrought

to
the
daughter
of
his
late
skipper
who
always
visits
him
on
that
day
do
thank
me
hardy
in
case
you
break
down
she
a
very
nice
girl
and
if
she
had
been
born
twenty
years
earlier
or
i

twenty
years
later
or
you
had
been

there
no
saying
what
might

i
want
you
to
interfere
in
my
business
said
hardy
working
sedulously
let
you
good
replied
swann
remember
thursdays
seven
to
said
hardy
incautiously
you
said
fridays
just
swann
made
no
reply
his
nose
was
immersed
in
the
folds
of
a
large
handkerchief
and
his
eyes
watered
profusely
behind
his
glasses
it
was
some
minutes
before
he
had
regained
his
normal
composure
and
even
then
the
sensitive
nerves
of
his
partner
were
offended
by
an
occasional
belated
chuckle
although
by
dint
of
casual
and
cautious
inquiries
hardy
found
that
his
partner
information
was
correct
he
was
by
no
means
guilty
of
any
feelings
of
gratitude
towards
him
and
he
only
glared
scornfully
when
that
excellent
but
frivolous
man
mounted
a
chair
on
friday
afternoon
and
putting
the
clock
on
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
urged
him
to
be
in
time
the
evening
however
found
him
starting
slowly
in
the
direction
of
fullalove
alley
his
father
had
gone
to
sea
again
and
the
house
was
very
dull
moreover
he
felt
a
mild
curiosity
to
see
the
changes
wrought
by
time
in
wilks
he
walked
along
by
the
sea
and
as
the
church
clock
struck
the
turned
into
the
alley
and
looked
eagerly
round
for
the
old
steward
the
labours
of
the
day
were
over
and
the
inhabitants
were
for
the
most
part
out
of
doors
taking
the
air
householders
leaning
against
their
smoking
exchanged
ideas
across
the
narrow
space
paved
with
which
separated
their
small
and
ancient
houses
while
the
matrons
more
gregariously
inclined
bunched
in
little
groups
and
discussed
subjects
which
in
higher
circles
would
have
inundated
the
land
with
libel
actions
up
and
down
the
alley
a
tiny
boy
all
ready
for
bed
with
the
exception
of
his
nightgown
mechanically
avoided
friendly
palms
as
he
sought
anxiously
for
his
mother
the
object
of
hardy
search
sat
at
the
door
of
his
front
room
which
opened
on
to
the
alley
smoking
an
evening
pipe
and
noting
with
an
interested
eye
the
doings
of
his
neighbours
he
was
just
preparing
to
draw
himself
up
in
his
chair
as
the
intruder
passed
when
to
his
utter
astonishment
that
gentleman
stopped
in
front
of
him
and
taking
possession
of
his
hand
shook
it
fervently
do
you
do
he
said
smiling
wilks
eyed
him
stupidly
and
releasing
his
hand
coyly
placed
it
in
his
and
breathed
hard
meant
to
come
before
said
hardy
i
been
so
busy
how
are
you
wilks
still
dazed
muttered
that
he
was
very
well
then
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
and
eyed
his
visitor
suspiciously
been
longing
for
a
chat
with
you
about
old
times
said
hardy
all
my
old
friends
you
seem
to
have
changed
the
least
you
do
look
a
day
getting
on
said
wilks
trying
to
speak
coldly
but
observing
with
some
gratification
the
effect
produced
upon
his
neighbours
by
the
appearance
of
this
acquaintance
wanted
to
ask
your
advice
said
the
unscrupulous
hardy
speaking
in
low
tones
daresay
you
know
i
just
gone
into
partnership
in
sunwich
and
i
told
there
no
man
knows
more
about
the
business
and
the
ins
and
outs
of
this
town
than
you
wilks
thawed
despite
himself
his
face
glistened
and
his
huge
mouth
broke
into
tremulous
smiles
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
and
then
noticing
that
a
little
group
near
them
had
suspended
their
conversation
to
listen
to
his
he
drew
his
chair
back
and
in
a
kind
voice
invited
the
searcher
after
wisdom
to
step
inside
hardy
thanked
him
and
following
him
in
took
a
chair
behind
the
door
and
with
an
air
of
youthful
deference
bent
his
ear
to
catch
the
pearls
which
fell
from
the
lips
of
his
host
since
he
was
a
babe
on
his
mother
knee
sixty
years
before
wilks
had
never
had
such
an
attentive
and
admiring
listener
hardy
sat
as
though
glued
to
his
chair
one
eye
on
wilks
and
the
other
on
the
clock
and
it
was
not
until
that
ancient
timepiece
struck
the
hour
that
the
suddenly
realized
the
awkward
state
of
affairs
more
i
can
give
you
i
shall
always
be
pleased
to
he
said
looking
at
the
clock
hardy
thanked
him
at
great
length
wondering
as
he
spoke
whether
miss
nugent
was
of
punctual
habits
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folding
his
arms
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
perturbed
wilks
must
come
round
and
smoke
a
pipe
with
me
sometimes
he
said
casually
wilks
flushed
with
gratified
pride
he
had
a
vision
of
himself
walking
up
to
the
front
door
of
the
hardys
smoking
a
pipe
in
a
room
and
telling
an
incredulous
and
envious
fullalove
alley
about
it
afterwards
shall
be
very
pleased
sir
he
said
impressively
round
on
tuesday
said
his
visitor
shall
be
at
home
wilks
thanked
him
and
spurred
on
to
hospitality
murmured
something
about
a
glass
of
ale
and
retired
to
the
back
to
draw
it
he
came
back
with
a
jug
and
a
couple
of
glasses
and
draining
his
own
at
a
draught
hoped
that
the
example
would
not
be
lost
upon
his
visitor
that
astute
person
however
after
a
modest
draught
sat
still
anchored
to
the
glass
expecting
somebody
tonight
said
the
at
last
doubt
you
have
a
lot
of
visitors
said
the
other
admiringly
wilks
did
not
deny
it
he
eyed
his
guest
glass
and
fidgeted
nugent
is
coming
he
said
instead
of
any
signs
of
disorder
and
preparations
for
rapid
flight
wilks
saw
that
the
other
was
quite
composed
he
began
to
entertain
a
poor
idea
of
hardy
memory
generally
comes
for
a
little
quiet
chat
he
said
between
the
two
of
us
said
the
other
his
visitor
said
and
as
though
some
chord
of
memory
had
been
touched
sat
gazing
dreamily
at
wilks
horticultural
collection
in
the
window
then
he
changed
colour
a
little
as
a
smart
hat
and
a
pretty
face
crossed
the
tiny
panes
wilks
changed
colour
too
and
in
an
awkward
fashion
rose
to
receive
miss
nugent
as
usual
sam
said
the
girl
sinking
into
a
chair
then
she
caught
sight
of
hardy
who
was
standing
by
the
door
a
long
time
since
you
and
i
met
miss
nugent
he
said
bowing
hardy
said
the
girl
doubtfully
miss
interposed
wilks
anxious
to
explain
his
position
called
in
to
see
me
quite
a
surprise
to
me
it
was
i
knowed
last
time
we
three
met
said
hardy
who
to
his
host
discomfort
had
resumed
his
chair
was
thrashing
me
and
you
were
urging
him
kate
nugent
eyed
him
carefully
it
was
preposterous
that
this
young
man
should
take
advantage
of
a
boy
and
girl
acquaintance
of
eleven
years
before
and
such
an
acquaintance
in
this
manner
her
eyes
expressed
a
little
surprise
not
unmixed
with
hauteur
but
hardy
was
too
pleased
to
have
them
turned
in
his
direction
at
all
to
quarrel
with
their
expression
were
a
bit
of
a
trial
in
them
days
said
wilks
shaking
his
head
i
live
to
be
ninety
i
shall
never
forget
seeing
miss
kate
capsized
the
way
she
was
the
way
she
is
your
cold
inquired
miss
nugent
hastily
miss
thankee
said
wilks
nugent
has
forgotten
and
forgiven
all
that
long
ago
said
hardy
assented
the
girl
coldly
can
not
remember
all
the
boys
and
girls
one
knew
as
a
not
said
hardy
find
that
many
have
slipped
from
my
own
memory
but
i
have
a
most
vivid
recollection
of
miss
nugent
looked
at
him
again
and
an
idea
strange
and
incredible
dawned
slowly
upon
her
childish
impressions
are
lasting
and
jem
hardy
had
remained
in
her
mind
as
a
sort
of
youthful
ogre
he
sat
before
her
now
a
frank
young
englishman
in
whose
honest
eyes
admiration
of
herself
could
not
be
concealed
indignation
and
surprise
struggled
for
supremacy
odd
remarked
wilks
who
had
a
happy
knack
at
times
of
saying
the
wrong
thing
odd
you
should
to
come
just
at
the
same
time
as
miss
kate
my
good
fortune
said
hardy
with
a
slight
bow
then
he
cocked
a
malignant
eye
at
the
innocent
wilks
and
wondered
at
what
age
men
discarded
the
useless
habit
of
blushing
opposite
him
sat
miss
nugent
calmly
observant
the
slightest
suggestion
of
disdain
in
her
expression
framed
in
the
queer
old
chair
which
had
belonged
to
wilks
grandfather
she
made
a
picture
at
which
jem
hardy
continued
to
gaze
with
respectful
ardour
a
hopeless
sense
of
possessed
him
but
the
idea
that
murchison
should
aspire
to
so
much
goodness
and
beauty
made
him
almost
despair
of
his
sex
his
reverie
was
broken
by
the
voice
of
wilks
quarter
to
eight
said
that
gentleman
ca
thought
it
was
later
than
that
said
hardy
simply
wilks
gasped
and
with
a
faint
shake
of
his
head
at
the
floor
abandoned
the
thankless
task
of
giving
hints
to
a
young
man
who
was
too
obtuse
to
see
them
and
it
was
not
until
some
time
later
that
hardy
sorely
against
his
inclinations
gave
his
host
a
hearty
handshake
and
with
a
respectful
bow
to
miss
nugent
took
his
departure
young
man
he
growed
said
wilks
deferentially
turning
to
his
remaining
visitor
improved
i
miss
nugent
looked
him
over
critically
before
replying
seems
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
she
remarked
wilks
smiled
a
satisfied
smile
came
to
ask
my
advice
about
business
he
said
softly
two
or
three
speak
o
me
as
knowing
a
thing
or
two
and
being
young
and
just
starting
came
to
talk
it
over
with
me
i
never
see
a
young
man
so
pleased
and
ready
to
take
advice
as
wot
he
is
coming
again
for
more
i
suppose
said
miss
nugent
carelessly
wilks
acquiesced
he
asked
me
to
go
over
to
his
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
on
tuesday
he
added
in
the
casual
manner
in
which
men
allude
to
their
aristocratic
connections
a
bit
lonely
all
by
miss
nugent
said
and
then
lapsing
into
silence
gave
little
occasional
at
wilks
as
though
in
search
of
any
hidden
charms
about
him
which
might
hitherto
have
escaped
her
at
the
same
time
james
hardy
walking
slowly
home
by
the
edge
of
the
sea
pondered
on
further
ways
and
means
of
ensnaring
the
affection
of
the
chapter
vii
the
anticipations
of
wilks
were
more
than
realized
on
the
following
tuesday
from
the
time
a
trim
maid
showed
him
into
the
until
late
at
night
when
he
left
a
feted
and
honoured
guest
with
one
of
his
host
best
cigars
between
his
teeth
nothing
that
could
yield
him
any
comfort
was
left
undone
in
the
easiest
of
easy
chairs
he
sat
in
the
garden
beneath
the
leafy
branches
of
apple
trees
and
undiluted
wisdom
and
advice
flowed
from
his
lips
in
a
stream
as
he
beamed
delightedly
upon
his
entertainer
their
talk
was
mainly
of
sunwich
and
sunwich
people
and
it
was
an
easy
step
from
these
to
equator
lodge
on
that
subject
most
people
would
have
found
the
somewhat
garrulous
but
jem
hardy
listened
with
great
content
and
even
brought
him
back
to
it
when
he
showed
signs
of
wandering
altogether
wilks
spent
one
of
the
pleasantest
evenings
of
his
life
and
returning
home
in
a
slight
state
of
mental
exhilaration
severely
exercised
the
tongues
of
fullalove
alley
by
a
bearing
considered
incompatible
with
his
station
jem
hardy
paid
a
return
call
on
the
following
friday
and
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
any
lack
of
warmth
in
his
reception
the
was
delighted
to
see
him
and
after
showing
him
various
curios
picked
up
during
his
voyages
took
him
to
the
small
yard
in
the
rear
festooned
with
beans
and
gave
him
a
chair
in
full
view
of
the
neighbours
the
only
visitor
tonight
said
hardy
after
an
hour
patient
listening
and
waiting
wilks
nodded
casually
kate
came
last
night
he
said
is
her
night
but
she
came
yesterday
hardy
said
indeed
and
fell
into
a
dismal
reverie
from
which
the
most
spirited
efforts
of
his
host
only
partially
aroused
him
without
giving
way
to
undue
egotism
it
was
pretty
clear
that
miss
nugent
had
changed
her
plans
on
his
account
and
a
long
vista
of
pleasant
friday
evenings
suddenly
vanished
he
too
resolved
to
vary
his
visits
and
starting
with
a
basis
of
two
a
week
sat
trying
to
solve
the
mathematical
chances
of
selecting
the
same
as
kate
nugent
calculations
which
were
not
facilitated
by
a
account
from
wilks
of
certain
interesting
amours
of
his
youthful
prime
before
he
saw
kate
nugent
again
however
another
old
acquaintance
turned
up
safe
and
sound
in
sunwich
captain
nugent
walking
into
the
town
saw
him
first
a
tall
young
man
in
shabby
clothing
whose
bearing
even
in
the
distance
was
oddly
familiar
as
he
came
closer
the
captain
misgivings
were
confirmed
and
in
the
sunburnt
fellow
in
tattered
clothes
who
advanced
upon
him
with
outstretched
hand
he
reluctantly
recognized
his
son
have
you
come
home
for
he
inquired
ignoring
the
hand
and
eyeing
him
from
head
to
foot
said
jack
nugent
laconically
as
the
smile
left
his
face
the
captain
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stood
silent
his
son
looked
first
up
the
road
and
then
down
well
at
home
he
inquired
jack
nugent
looked
up
the
road
again
much
change
in
the
town
he
said
at
length
said
his
father
i
glad
to
have
seen
you
said
his
son
said
the
captain
his
son
nodded
and
turning
on
his
heel
walked
back
towards
the
town
despite
his
forlorn
appearance
his
step
was
jaunty
and
he
carried
his
head
high
the
captain
watched
him
until
he
was
hidden
by
a
bend
in
the
road
and
then
ashamed
of
himself
for
displaying
so
much
emotion
turned
his
own
steps
in
the
direction
of
home
he
did
whine
he
said
slowly
got
a
bit
of
pride
meantime
the
prodigal
had
reached
the
town
again
and
stood
ruefully
considering
his
position
he
looked
up
the
street
and
then
the
shop
of
kybird
catching
his
eye
walked
over
and
inspected
the
contents
of
the
window
belts
and
watches
were
displayed
alluringly
behind
the
glass
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
a
row
of
cheap
clothing
dangling
from
short
poles
over
the
shop
front
all
the
goods
were
marked
in
plain
figures
in
reduced
circumstances
kybird
giving
a
soaring
imagination
play
in
the
first
marking
and
a
good
business
faculty
in
the
second
at
these
valuables
jack
nugent
with
a
view
of
obtaining
some
idea
of
prices
gazed
for
some
time
then
passing
between
two
suits
of
oilskins
which
stood
as
sentinels
in
the
doorway
he
entered
the
shop
and
smiled
affably
at
miss
kybird
who
was
in
charge
at
his
entrance
she
put
down
a
piece
of
which
kybird
called
his
sock
and
with
a
casual
glance
at
his
clothes
regarded
him
with
a
prejudiced
eye
day
said
the
customer
one
feel
quite
young
do
you
want
inquired
miss
kybird
nugent
turned
to
a
broken
which
stood
by
the
counter
and
after
applying
severe
tests
regardless
of
the
lady
feelings
sat
down
upon
it
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
walked
from
london
he
said
in
explanation
could
sit
here
for
here
began
the
indignant
miss
kybird
people
would
be
sure
to
couple
our
names
together
continued
nugent
mournfully
a
handsome
young
man
and
a
girl

want
to
buy
anything
or
not
demanded
miss
kybird
with
an
impatient
toss
of
her
head
said
jack
want
to
come
to
the
wrong

then
said

full
of

the
other
turned
in
his
chair
and
looked
hard
at
the
window
it
is
he
assented
a
good
job
i
brought
you
something
decent
to
put
he
felt
in
his
pockets
and
producing
a
a
battered
watch
a
knife
and
a
few
other
small
articles
deposited
them
with
reverent
care
upon
the
counter
use

us
declared
miss
kybird
anxious
to
hit
back
burn
coal
burn
better
than
the
coal

said
the
unmoved
customer
we
do
want
them
retorted
miss
kybird
raising
her
voice
i
do
want
any
of
your
impudence
get
up
out
of
our
her
heightened
tones
penetrated
to
the
small
and
untidy
room
behind
the
shop
the
door
opened
and
kybird
in
his
appeared
at
the
opening
the
row
he
demanded
his
little
black
eyes
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
a
lovers
quarrel
replied
jack
go
away
we
do
want
we
do
want
none
o
your
nonsense
said
the
shopkeeper
sharply
wot
more
we
wo
it
who
put
that
rubbish
on
my
counter
he
bustled
forward
and
taking
the
articles
in
his
hands
examined
them
closely
shillings
for
the
lot
cash
he
remarked
said
the
other
i
say

inquired
kybird
startled
at
this
ready
acceptance
you

replied
nugent
i
take
three
if
you
throw
in
a
kybird
much
against
his
inclinations
threw
in
a
faint
grin
and
opening
a
drawer
produced
three
shillings
and
flung
them
separately
on
the
counter
miss
kybird
thawed
somewhat
and
glancing
from
the
customer
clothes
to
his
face
saw
that
he
had
a
pleasant
eye
and
a
good
moustache
together
with
a
general
air
of
recklessness
much
appreciated
by
the
sex
spend
it
on
drink
she
remarked
not
unkindly
wo
said
the
other
solemnly
going
to
buy
house
property
with
darn
my
eyes
said
kybird
who
had
been
regarding
him
closely
my
old
eyes
if

ai
young
nugent
well

said
young
nugent
cheerfully

have
known

kybird
same
old
face

old
voice

old
come
now
objected
the
shopkeeper
shortening
his
arm
and
squinting
along
it
should
have
known
you
anywhere
continued
the
other
mournfully
here
i
thrown
up
a
splendid
berth
and
come
all
the
way
from
australia
just
for
one
glimpse
of
miss
kybird
and
she
does
know
me
when
i
die
kybird
you
will
find
the
word
engraven
upon
my
kybird
said
his
daughter
tossed
her
head
and
bade
nugent
take
his
nonsense
to
people
who
might
like
it
time
i
see
you
said
kybird
pursing
up
his
lips
and
gazing
at
the
counter
in
an
effort
of
memory
time
i
see
you
was
one
fifth
o
november
when
you
an
another
bright
young
party
was
going
about
in
two
suits
o
oilskins
wot
i
been
for
and
low
all
day
jack
nugent
sighed
were
happy
times
ha
been
for
you
retorted
the
other
his
temper
rising
a
little
at
the
remembrance
of
his
wrongs
you
come
home
for
good
inquired
miss
kybird
curiously
have
you
seen
your
father
he
passed
here
a
little
while
saw
him
said
jack
with
a
brevity
which
was
not
lost
upon
the
astute
kybird
may
stay
in
sunwich
and
i
may
not
it
all
not
going
said
kybird
the
shopkeeper
stood
considering
he
had
a
small
room
to
let
at
the
top
of
his
house
and
he
stood
divided
between
the
fear
of
not
getting
his
rent
and
the
joy
to
a
man
fond
of
simple
pleasures
to
be
obtained
by
dunning
the
arrogant
captain
nugent
for
his
son
debts
before
he
could
arrive
at
a
decision
his
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
stout
lady
from
the
back
parlour
who
having
conquered
his
scruples
against
matrimony
some
thirty
years
before
had
kept
a
particularly
eye
upon
him
ever
since
tea
cold
she
remarked
severely
her
husband
received
the
news
with
calmness
he
was
by
no
means
an
enthusiast
where
that
liquid
was
concerned
the
admiration
evoked
by
its
qualities
having
been
always
something
in
the
nature
of
a
mystery
to
him
coming
he
retorted
just
a
word
with
nugent
i
never
did
said
the
stout
lady
coming
farther
into
the
shop
and
regarding
the
visitor
should
knowed
if
you
asked
me
who
was
i
could
ha
told
you
i
should
knowed
from
jack
shook
his
head
hard
to
be
forgotten
like
this
he
said
sadly
miss
kybird
had
forgotten
me
after
all
that
had
passed
between
said
kybird
do
take
any
notice
of
him
said
his
daughter
like
to
see
kybird
paid
no
heed
he
was
still
thinking
of
the
son
of
captain
nugent
being
indebted
to
him
for
lodging
and
the
more
he
thought
of
the
idea
the
better
he
liked
it
now
you
he
said
with
a
great
assumption
of
cordiality
not
come
in
and
a
cup
o
tea
the
other
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
with
a
light
laugh
accepted
the
offer
he
followed
them
into
the
small
and
untidy
back
parlour
and
being
requested
by
his
hostess
to
squeeze
in
next
to
at
the
small
round
table
complied
so
literally
with
the
order
that
that
young
lady
complained
bitterly
of
his
encroachments
where
do
you
think
of
sleeping
tonight
inquired
kybird
after
his
daughter
had
to
use
her
own
expressive
phrase
shown
the
guest
nugent
shook
his
head
shall
get
a
lodging
somewhere
he
said
airily
a
room
upstairs
as
you
might
if
you
liked
said
kybird
slowly
been
let
to
a
very
respectable
clean
young
man
for
half
a
crown
a
week
really
it
ought
to
be
three
shillings
but
if
you
like
to
it
at
the
old
price
you
with
you
said
the
other
doubt
you
soon
get
something
to
do
continued
kybird
more
in
answer
to
his
wife
inquiring
glances
than
anything
else
a
crown
every
saturday
and
the
room
nugent
thanked
him
and
after
making
a
tea
which
caused
kybird
to
congratulate
himself
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
offered
to
board
him
sat
regaling
kybird
and
daughter
with
a
recital
of
his
adventures
in
australia
receiving
in
return
a
full
and
true
account
of
sunwich
and
its
people
up
to
date
no
pride
about
that
what
i
like
said
kybird
to
her
lord
and
master
as
they
sat
alone
after
closing
time
over
a
glass
of
gin
and
water
a
nice
young
feller
but
bisness
is
bisness
and
you
do
get
your
rent
shall
get
it
sooner
or
later
said
kybird
father
of
be
in
a
fine
way
at
living
here
that
wot
i
thinking
do
see
why
said
kybird
bridling
captain
nugent
i
should
like
to
know
we
as
good
as
what
is
if
not
better
and
as
for
the
gell
if
she
got
amelia
looks
she
a
gal
assented
kybird
wonder
he
laid
his
pipe
down
on
the
table
and
stared
at
the
mantelpiece
seems
very
struck
with
he
concluded
see
that
afore
i
did
said
his
wife
sharply
it
afore
you
come
into
the
shop
said
kybird
triumphantly
be
a
strange
thing
to
marry
into
that
family
keeping
company
with
young
teddy
silk
his
wife
reminded
him
coldly
if
she
was
she
could
do
better
than
a
young
man
without
a
penny
in
pocket
pride
a
fine
thing
but
you
ca
live
on
know
what
i
talking
about
said
kybird
impatiently
know
she
keeping
company
with
teddy
as
well
as
wot
you
do
still
as
far
as
money
goes
young
nugent
be
all
inquired
his
wife
kybird
hesitated
and
took
a
sip
of
his
gin
and
water
then
he
regarded
the
wife
of
his
bosom
with
a
calculating
glance
which
at
once
excited
that
lady
easily
kindled
wrath
know
i
never
tell
secrets
she
cried
often
corrected
kybird
then
i
do
often
tell
you
any
wot
would
you
say
to
young
nugent
coming
into
five
pounds
mother
left
when
he
he
do
know
it
but
i
repeated
his
wife
said
the
other
not
sure
but
i
know
i
it
from
young
roberts
when
was
at
stone
and
dartnell
five
pounds
i
shall
get
my
money
all
right
some
time
and
if
wants
a
little
bit
to
go
on
with
can
have
it
he
honest
enough
i
can
see
that
by
his
upstairs
in
the
tiny
room
under
the
tiles
jack
nugent
in
blissful
ignorance
of
his
landlord
generous
sentiments
towards
him
slept
the
sound
dreamless
sleep
of
the
man
free
from
monetary
cares
in
the
sanctity
of
her
chamber
miss
kybird
gazing
approvingly
at
the
reflection
of
her
yellow
hair
and
fine
eyes
in
the
little
cracked
was
already
comparing
him
very
favourably
with
the
somewhat
pessimistic
mr
silk
chapter
viii
nugent
return
caused
a
sensation
in
several
quarters
the
feeling
at
equator
lodge
bordering
close
upon
open
mutiny
even
kingdom
plucked
up
spirit
and
read
the
astonished
captain
a
homily
upon
the
first
duties
of
a
parent
a
homily
which
she
backed
up
by
reading
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
through
to
the
bitter
end
at
the
conclusion
she
broke
down
entirely
and
was
led
up
to
bed
by
kate
and
bella
the
sympathy
of
the
latter
taking
an
acute
form
and
consisting
mainly
of
innuendoes
which
could
only
refer
to
one
person
in
the
house
kate
nugent
who
was
not
prone
to
tears
took
a
different
line
but
with
no
better
success
the
captain
declined
to
discuss
the
subject
and
after
listening
to
a
description
of
himself
in
which
nero
and
other
celebrities
figured
for
the
purpose
of
having
their
characters
whitewashed
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
jem
hardy
heard
of
the
new
arrival
from
his
partner
and
ignoring
that
gentleman
urgent
advice
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
and
take
master
nugent
for
a
walk
forthwith
sat
thoughtfully
considering
how
to
turn
the
affair
to
the
best
advantage
a
slight
outbreak
of
diphtheria
at
fullalove
alley
had
for
a
time
closed
that
thoroughfare
to
miss
nugent
and
he
was
inclined
to
regard
the
opportune
arrival
of
her
brother
as
an
effort
of
providence
on
his
behalf
for
some
days
however
he
looked
for
jack
nugent
in
vain
that
gentleman
either
being
out
of
doors
engaged
in
an
earnest
search
for
work
or
snugly
seated
in
the
back
parlour
of
the
kybirds
indulging
in
the
somewhat
perilous
pastime
of
paying
compliments
to
amelia
kybird
remittances
which
had
reached
him
from
his
sister
and
aunt
had
been
promptly
returned
and
he
was
indebted
to
the
amiable
kybird
for
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
in
these
circumstances
a
warm
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
the
family
closed
his
eyes
to
their
obvious
shortcomings
he
even
obtained
work
down
at
the
harbour
through
a
friend
of
kybird
it
was
not
of
a
very
exalted
nature
and
caused
more
strain
upon
the
back
than
the
intellect
but
seven
years
of
roughing
it
had
left
him
singularly
free
from
caste
prejudices
a
freedom
which
he
soon
discovered
was
not
shared
by
his
old
acquaintances
at
sunwich
the
discovery
made
him
somewhat
bitter
and
when
hardy
stopped
him
one
afternoon
as
he
was
on
his
way
home
from
work
he
tried
to
ignore
his
outstretched
hand
and
continued
on
his
way
is
a
long
time
since
we
met
said
hardy
placing
himself
in
front
of
him
heavens
said
jack
regarding
him
closely
jemmy
hardy
grown
up
spick
and
span
like
the
industrious
little
boys
in
the
i
heard
you
were
back
came
back
just
before
you
did
said
hardy
band
playing
you
in
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
suppose
said
the
other
how
the
wicked
prosper
and
you
were
wicked
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
knock
me
about
round
to
my
place
and
have
a
chat
said
hardy
jack
shook
his
head
expecting
me
in
to
tea
he
said
with
a
nod
in
the
direction
of
kybird
honest
waterside
labourers
who
earn
their
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
when
the
foreman
is
looking
do
not
frequent
the
society
of
the
upper
be
a
fool
said
hardy
politely
i
not
very
tidy
retorted
nugent
glancing
at
his
clothes
do
mind
it
myself
i
a
philosopher
and
nothing
hurts
me
so
long
as
i
have
enough
to
eat
and
drink
but
i
do
inflict
myself
on
my
friends
and
i
must
say
most
of
them
meet
me
more
than
said
hardy
except
kate
and
my
aunt
said
jack
firmly
kate
i
tried
to
cut
her
the
other
her
echoed
hardy
nugent
nodded
save
her
feelings
he
replied
she
would
be
cut
bless
her
and
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
it
was
to
form
a
precedent
i
let
her
kiss
me
behind
a
waggon
do
you
know
i
fancy
she
grown
up
rather
jem
are
observant
said
hardy
admiringly
course
it
may
be
my
partiality
said
nugent
with
judicial
fairness
was
always
a
bit
fond
of
kate
i
do
suppose
anybody
else
would
see
anything
in
her
where
are
you
living
now
road
said
hardy
round
any
evening
you
can
if
you
wo
come
nugent
promised
and
catching
sight
of
miss
kybird
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
shop
bade
him
and
crossed
the
road
it
was
becoming
quite
a
regular
thing
for
her
to
wait
and
have
her
tea
with
him
now
an
arrangement
which
was
provocative
of
many
sly
remarks
on
the
part
of
kybird
you
were
never
coming
said
miss
kybird
tartly
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
back
room
and
took
her
seat
at
the
untidy
you
been
crying
your
eyes
out
i
suppose
remarked
nugent
as
he
groped
in
the
depths
of
a
tall
jar
for
jam
you
not
the
first
and
i
do
suppose
you
be
the
last
how
teddy
your
tea
retorted
miss
kybird
do
make
that
scraping
noise
on
the
bottom
of
the
jar
with
your
knife
it
puts
my
teeth
on
it
does
mine
said
nugent
there
a
black
currant
down
there
and
i
mean
to
have
it
not
want
not
him
put
that
knife
down
said
miss
kybird
as
her
mother
entered
the
room
kybird
shook
her
head
at
him
two
are
always
quarrelling
she
said
archly
like
a
couple
of
couple
of
suggested
nugent
kybird
in
great
glee
squeezed
round
to
him
and
smote
him
playfully
with
her
large
fat
hand
and
then
being
somewhat
out
of
breath
with
the
exertion
sat
down
to
enjoy
the
jest
in
comfort
how
you
encourage
him
said
her
daughter
wonder
he
does
behave
no
wonder
he
acts
as
if
the
whole
place
belongs
to
the
remark
was
certainly
descriptive
of
nugent
behaviour
his
easy
assurance
and
affability
had
already
made
him
a
prime
favourite
with
kybird
and
had
not
been
without
its
effect
upon
her
daughter
the
constrained
and
severe
company
manners
of
edward
silk
showed
up
but
poorly
beside
those
of
the
paying
guest
and
miss
kybird
had
on
several
occasions
drawn
comparisons
which
would
have
rendered
both
gentlemen
uneasy
if
they
had
known
of
them
nugent
carried
the
same
easy
with
him
the
following
week
when
neatly
attired
in
a
suit
from
kybird
extensive
stock
he
paid
a
visit
to
jem
hardy
to
talk
over
old
times
and
discuss
the
future
ought
to
make
friends
with
your
father
said
the
latter
only
wants
a
little
common
sense
and
mutual
all
said
nugent
easy
enough
does
it
no
all
he
wants
is
for
me
to
clear
out
of
sunwich
and
i
not
going
to
until
it
pleases
me
at
any
rate
it
poison
to
him
for
me
to
be
living
at
the
kybirds
and
pushing
a
trolley
down
on
the
quay
talk
about
love
sweetening
toil
that
hardy
changed
the
subject
and
nugent
nothing
loath
discoursed
on
his
wanderings
and
took
him
on
a
personally
conducted
tour
through
the
continent
of
australia
i
come
back
to
lay
my
bones
in
sunwich
churchyard
he
concluded
pathetically
is
when
i
done
with
lot
of
things
happen
before
then
said
hardy
hope
so
rejoined
nugent
piously
desire
is
to
be
buried
by
my
weeping
in
fact
i
left
instructions
to
that
effect
in
my
will
all
i
have
left
by
the
not
going
to
keep
on
at
this
work
i
suppose
said
hardy
making
another
effort
to
give
the
conversation
a
serious
turn
foreman
does
think
so
replied
the
other
as
he
helped
himself
to
some
whisky
has
made
several
remarks
to
that
effect
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
thoughtfully
by
no
means
insensible
to
the
comfort
of
his
surroundings
he
had
not
been
in
such
comfortable
quarters
since
he
left
home
seven
years
before
he
thought
of
the
untidy
litter
of
the
kybirds
back
parlour
with
the
forlorn
view
of
the
yard
in
the
rear
something
of
his
reflections
he
confided
to
hardy
as
he
rose
to
leave
my
market
value
is
about
a
pound
a
week
he
concluded
ruefully
i
must
cut
my
coat
to
suit
my
cloth
he
walked
home
somewhat
soberly
at
first
but
the
air
was
cool
and
fresh
and
a
glorious
moon
was
riding
in
the
sky
he
whistled
cheerfully
and
his
spirits
rose
as
various
chimerical
plans
of
making
money
occurred
to
him
by
the
time
he
reached
the
high
street
the
shops
of
which
were
all
closed
for
the
night
he
was
earning
five
hundred
a
year
and
spending
a
thousand
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
walking
in
discovered
miss
kybird
entertaining
company
in
the
person
of
edward
silk
he
said
airily
as
he
took
a
seat
mind
me
young
people
go
on
just
as
you
would
if
i
were
not
edward
silk
grumbled
something
under
his
breath
miss
kybird
turning
to
the
intruder
with
a
smile
of
welcome
remarked
that
she
had
just
thought
of
going
to
sleep
to
sleep
repeated
mr
silk
said
miss
kybird
yawning
mr
silk
gazed
at
her
with
me
he
inquired
in
trembling
tones
not
very
lively
company
said
miss
kybird
bending
over
her
sewing
do
think
you
spoken
a
word
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
and
before
that
you
were
talking
of
made
my
flesh
creep
you
said
nugent
did
say
anything
to
me
about
your
flesh
creeping
muttered
mr
silk
ought
to
have
seen
it
creep
interposed
nugent
severely
not
talking
to
you
said
mr
silk
turning
on
him
i
want
the
favour
of
remarks
from
you
i
let
you
you
talk
to
my
gentlemen
friends
like
that
teddy
said
miss
kybird
sharply
i
wo
have
it
why
do
you
try
and
be
bright
and
cheerful
like
nugent
mr
silk
turned
and
regarded
that
gentleman
steadfastly
nugent
meeting
his
gaze
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
a
offer
to
give
him
lessons
at
half
a
crown
an
hour
would
be
like
for
worlds
said
mr
silk
with
a
scornful
laugh
sooner
be
like
have
you
been
saying
to
him
inquired
nugent
replied
miss
kybird
often
like
that
he
got
a
nasty
miserable
jealous
disposition
not
that
i
mind
what
he
mr
silk
breathed
hard
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
he
grow
out
of
it
said
nugent
hopefully
up
teddy
you
young
i
arsk
said
the
solemnly
enraged
mr
silk
i
arsk
you
not
to
be
so
free
with
my
christian
name
does
like
his
name
now
said
nugent
drawing
his
chair
closer
to
miss
kybird
i
do
wonder
at
it
what
shall
we
call
him
job
what
that
work
you
doing
why
do
you
get
on
with
that
fancy
waistcoat
you
are
doing
for
me
before
miss
kybird
could
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
article
in
question
her
sorely
tried
swain
created
a
diversion
by
rising
to
that
simple
act
he
imparted
an
emphasis
which
commanded
the
attention
of
both
beholders
and
drawing
over
to
miss
kybird
he
stood
over
her
in
an
attitude
at
once
terrifying
and
reproachful
your
choice
amelia
he
said
in
a
thrilling
voice
or
which
is
it
to
be
steady
old
man
cried
the
startled
nugent
or
repeated
mr
silk
in
stern
but
broken
accents
miss
kybird
giggled
and
avoiding
his
gaze
looked
pensively
at
the
faded
hearthrug
making
her
blush
said
nugent
sternly
down
teddy
i
ashamed
of
you
we
both
ashamed
of
you
you
confusing
us
dreadfully
proposing
to
us
both
in
this
mr
silk
regarded
him
with
a
scornful
eye
but
miss
kybird
bidding
him
not
to
be
foolish
punctuated
her
remarks
with
the
needle
and
a
struggle
which
mr
silk
regarded
as
unseemly
in
the
highest
degree
took
place
between
them
for
its
possession
nugent
secured
it
at
last
and
brandishing
it
fiercely
extorted
feminine
screams
from
miss
kybird
by
threatening
her
with
it
nor
was
her
mind
relieved
until
nugent
remarking
that
he
would
put
it
back
in
the
pincushion
placed
it
in
the
leg
of
edward
silk
kybird
and
his
wife
entering
through
the
shop
were
just
in
time
to
witness
a
spirited
performance
on
the
part
of
mr
silk
the
cherished
purpose
of
which
was
to
deprive
them
of
a
lodger
he
drew
back
as
they
entered
and
raising
his
voice
above
miss
kybird
began
to
explain
his
action
i
ashamed
of
you
said
kybird
shaking
his
head
little
joke
like
that
a
little
innercent
it
been
a
now
began
kybird
right
said
the
desperate
mr
silk
it
your
own
way
let
marry
i
do
care
give
said
kybird
in
a
shocked
voice
mr
silk
thrust
him
fiercely
to
one
side
and
passed
raging
through
the
shop
the
sound
of
articles
falling
in
all
directions
attested
to
his
blind
haste
and
the
force
with
which
he
slammed
the
was
sufficient
evidence
of
his
state
of
mind
upon
my
word
said
the
staring
kybird
all
the
outrageyous
mind
said
his
wife
who
was
sitting
in
the
easy
chair
distributing
affectionate
smiles
between
her
daughter
and
the
startled
nugent
happy
jack
that
all
i
arsk
she
been
a
good
gal
and
she
make
a
good
wife
i
seen
how
it
was
between
you
for
some
i
said
kybird
he
shook
hands
warmly
with
nugent
and
patting
that
perturbed
man
on
the
back
surveyed
him
with
eyes
glistening
with
approval
a
bit
rough
on
teddy
is
it
inquired
nugent
anxiously
you
worry
about
said
kybird
affectionately
ai
worth
was
said
nugent
truthfully
the
situation
had
developed
so
rapidly
that
it
had
caught
him
at
a
disadvantage
he
had
a
dim
feeling
that
having
been
the
cause
of
miss
kybird
losing
one
young
man
the
most
elementary
notions
of
chivalry
demanded
that
he
should
furnish
her
with
another
and
this
idea
was
clearly
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
her
parents
he
looked
over
at
amelia
and
with
characteristic
philosophy
accepted
the
position
shall
be
the
handsomest
couple
in
sunwich
he
said
simply
none
said
kybird
emphatically
the
stout
lady
in
the
chair
gazed
at
the
couple
fondly
reminds
me
of
our
wedding
she
said
softly
was
it
tom
fletcher
said
father
can
you
remember
smith
you
mean
corrected
kybird
fletcher
said
something
i
sure
persisted
his
wife
did
said
kybird
grimly
i
pretty
near
broke
for
it
smith
is
the
one
you
thinking
kybird
after
a
moment
reflection
admitted
that
he
was
right
and
the
chain
of
memory
being
touched
waxed
discursive
about
her
own
wedding
and
the
somewhat
exciting
details
which
accompanied
it
after
which
she
produced
a
bottle
labelled
from
the
cupboard
and
filling
four
glasses
celebrated
the
occasion
in
a
befitting
but
sober
fashion
said
nugent
as
he
sat
on
his
bed
that
night
to
take
his
boots
off
is
what
comes
of
trying
to
make
everybody
happy
and
comfortable
with
a
little
fun
i
wonder
what
the
governor
chapter
ix
the
news
of
his
only
son
engagement
took
captain
nugent
breath
away
which
all
things
considered
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
it
could
have
done
he
sat
at
home
in
silent
rage
only
exploding
when
the
kingdom
sought
to
minimize
his
troubles
by
comparing
them
with
those
of
job
her
reminder
that
to
the
best
of
her
remembrance
he
had
never
had
a
boil
in
his
life
put
the
finishing
touch
to
his
patience
and
despairing
of
synonyms
for
the
words
which
trembled
on
his
lips
he
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
to
the
garden
his
son
bore
his
new
honours
bravely
to
an
appealing
and
indignant
letter
from
his
sister
he
wrote
gravely
reminding
her
of
the
difference
in
their
years
and
also
that
he
had
never
interfered
in
her
flirtations
however
sorely
his
brotherly
heart
might
have
been
wrung
by
them
he
urged
her
to
forsake
such
diversions
for
the
future
and
to
look
for
an
alliance
with
some
noble
man
with
a
large
banking
account
and
a
fondness
for
his
wife
relatives
to
jem
hardy
who
ventured
on
a
delicate
remonstrance
one
evening
he
was
less
patient
and
displayed
a
newly
acquired
dignity
which
was
a
source
of
considerable
embarrassment
to
that
gentleman
he
even
got
up
to
search
for
his
hat
and
was
only
induced
to
resume
his
seat
by
the
physical
exertions
of
his
host
did
mean
to
be
offensive
said
the
latter
you
were
said
the
aggrieved
man
hardy
apologized
of
that
kind
is
a
slight
to
my
future
wife
said
nugent
firmly
what
business
is
it
of
yours
hardy
regarded
him
thoughtfully
it
was
some
time
since
he
had
seen
miss
nugent
and
he
felt
that
he
was
losing
valuable
time
he
had
hoped
great
things
from
the
advent
of
her
brother
and
now
his
intimacy
seemed
worse
than
useless
he
resolved
to
take
him
into
his
confidence
spoke
from
selfish
motives
he
said
at
last
wanted
you
to
make
friends
with
your
father
for
inquired
the
other
staring
pave
the
way
for
me
said
hardy
raising
his
voice
as
he
thought
of
his
wrongs
now
owing
to
your
confounded
matrimonial
business
that
all
knocked
on
the
head
i
would
care
whom
you
married
if
it
did
interfere
with
my
affairs
you
mean
inquired
the
astonished
nugent
you
want
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
my
father
nugent
gazed
at
him
have
had
a
blow
on
the
head
or
anything
of
that
sort
at
any
time
have
you
he
inquired
hardy
shook
his
head
impatiently
do
seem
to
suffer
from
an
excess
of
intellect
yourself
he
retorted
do
want
to
be
offensive
again
still
i
should
think
it
is
pretty
plain
there
is
only
one
reason
why
i
should
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
the
society
of
your
what
you
like
about
my
intellect
replied
the
dutiful
son
i
ca
think
of
even
one
not
even
a
small
one
not
good
gracious
you
do
mean
you
ca
mean
hardy
looked
at
him
that
said
nugent
whose
intellect
had
suddenly
become
painfully
acute
her
not
inquired
the
other
nugent
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
him
with
an
air
of
kindly
interest
there
no
need
for
you
to
worry
about
my
father
for
that
he
said
would
raise
no
said
hardy
starting
up
from
his
chair
would
welcome
it
said
nugent
positively
is
nothing
that
he
would
like
better
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
a
secret
she
likes
hardy
reddened
do
you
know
he
stammered
know
it
for
a
fact
said
the
other
impressively
have
heard
her
say
so
but
you
been
very
about
me
jem
so
that
i
shall
say
what
i
said
his
bewildered
friend
think
you
be
throwing
yourself
away
said
nugent
my
mind
it
a
most
unsuitable
match
in
every
way
she
got
no
money
no
looks
no
style
nothing
but
a
good
kind
heart
rather
the
worse
for
wear
i
suppose
you
know
she
been
married
once
shouted
the
other
nugent
nodded
his
face
was
perfectly
grave
but
the
joke
was
beginning
to
prey
upon
his
vitals
in
a
manner
which
brooked
no
delay
thought
everybody
knew
it
he
said
have
never
disguised
the
fact
her
husband
died
twenty
years
ago
last
said
his
suddenly
enlightened
listener
what
nugent
incapable
of
reply
put
his
head
on
the
table
and
beat
the
air
frantically
with
his
hand
while
gasping
sobs
rent
his
tortured
frame
aunt
he
choked
pleas
pleased
she
be
if
she
knew
do
look
like
that
hardy
you
kill
seem
amused
said
hardy
between
his
teeth
you
be
kate
uncle
said
nugent
sitting
up
and
wiping
his
eyes
little
he
put
his
head
on
the
table
again
mine
he
wailed
jemmy
will
you
tip
us
nunky
hardy
expression
of
lofty
scorn
only
served
to
retard
his
recovery
but
he
sat
up
at
last
and
giving
his
eyes
a
final
wipe
beamed
kindly
upon
his
victim
i
do
what
i
can
for
you
he
observed
i
suppose
you
know
kate
off
for
a
three
months
visit
to
london
the
other
observed
that
he
did
know
it
and
taught
by
his
recent
experience
eyed
him
suspiciously
quite
true
said
nugent
going
to
stay
with
some
relatives
of
ours
she
used
to
be
very
fond
of
one
of
the
boys
her
cousin
herbert
so
you
must
be
surprised
if
she
comes
back
engaged
but
i
daresay
you
have
forgotten
all
about
her
in
three
months
and
anyway
i
do
suppose
she
look
at
you
if
you
were
the
last
man
in
the
world
if
you
walk
part
of
the
way
home
with
me
i
regale
you
with
anecdotes
of
her
chilhood
which
will
probably
cause
you
to
change
your
views
in
fullalove
alley
edward
silk
his
forebodings
fulfilled
received
the
news
of
amelia
kybird
faithlessness
in
a
spirit
of
quiet
despair
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
voluble
sympathy
of
his
neighbours
similar
things
had
happened
to
young
men
living
there
before
but
their
behaviour
had
been
widely
different
to
mr
silk
bob
crump
for
instance
had
been
jilted
on
the
very
morning
he
had
arranged
for
his
wedding
but
instead
of
going
about
in
a
state
of
gentle
melancholy
he
went
round
and
fought
his
beloved
father
merely
because
it
was
her
father
and
wound
up
an
exciting
day
by
selling
off
his
household
goods
to
the
highest
bidders
henry
jones
in
similar
circumstances
relieved
his
great
grief
by
walking
up
and
down
the
alley
smashing
every
window
within
reach
of
his
stick
but
these
were
men
of
spirit
mr
silk
was
cast
in
a
different
mould
and
his
fair
neighbours
sympathized
heartily
with
him
in
his
bereavement
while
utterly
failing
to
understand
any
man
breaking
his
heart
over
amelia
kybird
his
mother
a
widow
of
uncertain
age
shook
her
head
over
him
and
hinted
darkly
at
consumption
an
idea
which
was
very
pleasing
to
her
son
and
gave
him
an
increased
interest
in
a
slight
cold
from
which
he
was
suffering
wants
taking
out
of
said
wilks
who
had
stepped
across
the
alley
to
discuss
the
subject
with
his
neighbour
society
and
that
what
got
a
faithful
sighed
mrs
silk
in
the
family
ca
might
be
lifted
out
of
it
urged
wilks
several
disappointments
in
my
young
days
one
time
i
a
fresh
gal
every
mrs
silk
sniffed
and
looked
up
the
alley
whereat
two
neighbours
who
happened
to
be
at
their
doors
glanced
up
and
down
casually
and
retreated
inside
to
continue
their
vigil
from
the
windows
courted
me
for
fifteen
years
before
i
would
say
she
said
severely
years
responded
the
other
he
cast
his
eyes
upwards
and
his
lips
twitched
the
most
casual
observer
could
have
seen
that
he
was
engaged
in
calculations
of
an
abstruse
and
elusive
nature
was
seven
when
started
said
mrs
silk
sharply
wilks
brought
his
eyes
to
a
level
again
seven
he
remarked
we
was
married
two
days
before
my
nineteenth
birthday
added
mrs
silk
whose
own
arithmetic
had
always
been
her
weak
point
so
said
wilks
he
glanced
at
the
sharp
white
face
and
shapeless
figure
before
him
hard
to
believe
you
can
a
son
teddy
age
he
added
gallantly
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
getting
on
said
the
widow
the
agreed
and
after
standing
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
made
a
preliminary
motion
of
withdrawal
your
plants
are
looking
said
mrs
silk
glancing
over
at
his
window
ca
think
what
you
do
to
the
gratified
wilks
began
to
explain
it
appeared
that
plants
wanted
almost
as
much
looking
after
as
daughters
should
like
to
see
close
said
mrs
silk
in
and
a
look
at
responded
her
neighbour
mrs
silk
hesitated
and
displayed
a
maidenly
coyness
far
in
excess
of
the
needs
of
the
situation
then
she
stepped
across
and
five
seconds
later
the
two
matrons
with
consternation
writ
large
upon
their
faces
appeared
at
their
doors
again
and
exchanging
glances
across
the
alley
met
in
the
centre
they
were
more
surprised
an
evening
or
two
later
to
see
wilks
leave
his
house
to
pay
a
return
visit
bearing
in
his
hand
a
small
bunch
of
his
cherished
blooms
that
they
were
blooms
which
would
have
paid
the
debt
of
nature
in
a
few
hours
at
most
in
no
way
detracted
from
the
widow
expressions
of
pleasure
at
receiving
them
and
wilks
who
had
been
invited
over
to
cheer
up
mr
silk
who
was
in
a
particularly
black
mood
sat
and
smiled
like
a
detected
philanthropist
as
she
placed
them
in
water
evenin
teddy
he
said
breezily
with
a
at
his
hostess
a
lovely
day
we
bright
said
mrs
silk
nodding
with
spirit
wilks
sat
down
and
gave
vent
to
such
a
cheerful
laugh
that
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
shook
with
it
good
to
be
alive
he
declared
you
enjoy
your
life
wilks
said
the
widow
it
roared
wilks
it
why
should
i
why
should
everybody
enjoy
their
lives
it
was
what
they
was
given
to
us
they
was
affirmed
mrs
silk
can
deny
that
not
if
they
wants
to
deny
it
retorted
wilks
in
the
high
voice
he
kept
for
purposes
enjoy
every
day
o
my
he
filled
his
pipe
chuckling
serenely
and
having
lit
it
sat
and
enjoyed
that
mrs
silk
retired
for
a
space
and
returning
with
a
jug
of
ale
poured
him
out
a
glass
and
set
it
by
his
elbow
your
good
said
wilks
raising
it
yours
teddy
a
long
life
and
a
mr
silk
turned
listlessly
do
want
a
long
life
he
remarked
his
mother
and
her
visitor
exchanged
glances
goes
on
remarked
the
former
in
an
audible
whisper
wilks
nodded
reassuringly
them
ideas
once
he
said
they
go
off
if
you
could
only
live
to
see
teddy
at
the
age
o
would
want
to
go
then
say
it
was
crool
hard
being
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
mrs
silk
laughed
gaily
and
wilks
bellowed
a
gruff
accompaniment
edward
silk
eyed
them
pityingly
the
of
it
he
said
slowly
as
he
looked
round
from
his
seat
by
the
fireplace
where
the
of
things
comes
in
that
where
i
envy
me
said
the
smiling
visitor
for
you
so
near
the
grave
said
mr
silk
wilks
who
was
taking
another
draught
of
beer
put
the
glass
down
and
eyed
him
fixedly
why
i
envy
you
continued
the
other
do
want
to
live
and
you
do
and
yet
i
dessay
i
shall
be
walking
about
forty
and
fifty
years
after
you
dead
and
d
mean
near
the
grave
inquired
wilks
somewhat
shortly
was
referring
to
your
age
replied
the
other
strange
to
see
the
aged
on
to
life
you
ca
much
pleasure
at
your
time
o
life
and
you
all
alone
the
last
withered
branch
branch
began
wilks
look
teddy
the
others
gone
pursued
mr
silk
they
beckoning
to
beckon
said
wilks
coldly
not
going
not
young
said
mr
silk
gazing
meditatively
at
the
grate
i
envy
you
that
it
can
only
be
a
matter
of
a
year
or
two
at
most
before
you
are
sleeping
your
last
long
protested
mrs
silk
true
mother
said
the
melancholy
youth
wilks
is
old
why
should
mind
being
told
of
it
if
had
the
trouble
i
be
glad
to
go
but
he
to
go
whether
likes
it
or
not
it
might
be
tonight
who
can
tell
wilks
unasked
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
ale
and
drank
it
off
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
intended
to
make
sure
of
that
it
seemed
a
trifle
more
flat
than
the
last
many
men
o
your
age
and
thereabouts
continued
mr
silk
that
they
going
to
live
on
to
eighty
or
ninety
but
there
very
few
of
do
it
only
a
short
while
wilks
and
the
little
children
be
running
about
over
your
grave
and
picking
daisies
off
of
will
they
said
the
irritated
wilks
better
not
let
me
catch
at
it
that
always
talking
like
that
now
said
mrs
silk
not
without
a
certain
pride
in
her
tones
why
i
asked
you
in
to
cheer
your
troubles
be
over
then
continued
the
warning
voice
in
a
month
or
two
even
your
name
be
forgotten
that
the
way
of
the
world
think
soon
the
last
five
years
of
your
life
passed
the
next
five
pass
ten
times
as
fast
even
if
you
live
as
long
which
ai
talks
like
a
clergyman
said
mrs
silk
in
a
stage
whisper
wilks
nodded
and
despite
his
hostess
protests
rose
to
go
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
after
a
short
but
sharp
inward
struggle
shook
hands
with
her
son
it
was
late
in
the
evening
as
he
left
but
the
houses
had
not
yet
been
lit
up
dim
figures
sat
in
doorways
or
stood
about
the
alley
and
there
was
an
air
of
peace
and
rest
strangely
and
uncomfortably
in
keeping
with
the
conversation
to
which
he
had
just
been
listening
he
looked
in
at
his
own
door
the
furniture
seemed
stiffer
than
usual
and
the
tick
of
the
clock
more
deliberate
he
closed
the
door
again
and
taking
a
deep
breath
set
off
towards
the
life
and
bustle
of
the
two
schooners
chapter
x
time
failed
to
soften
the
captain
ideas
concerning
his
son
engagement
and
all
mention
of
the
subject
in
the
house
was
strictly
forbidden
occasionally
he
was
favoured
with
a
glimpse
of
his
son
and
miss
kybird
out
together
a
sight
which
imparted
such
a
flavour
to
his
temper
and
ordinary
intercourse
that
kingdom
in
unconscious
imitation
of
james
hardy
began
to
count
the
days
which
must
elapse
before
her
niece
return
from
london
his
even
infected
the
other
members
of
the
household
and
kingdom
sat
brooding
in
her
bedroom
all
one
afternoon
because
bella
had
called
her
an
the
finishing
touch
to
his
patience
was
supplied
by
a
little
misunderstanding
between
kybird
and
the
police
for
the
second
time
in
his
career
the
shopkeeper
appeared
before
the
magistrates
to
explain
the
circumstances
in
which
he
had
purchased
stolen
property
and
for
the
second
time
he
left
the
court
without
a
stain
on
his
character
but
with
a
significant
magisterial
caution
not
to
appear
there
again
jack
nugent
gave
evidence
in
the
case
and
some
of
his
replies
were
deemed
worthy
of
reproduction
in
the
sunwich
herald
a
circumstance
which
lost
the
proprietors
a
subscriber
of
many
years
standing
one
by
one
various
schemes
for
preventing
his
son
projected
alliance
were
dismissed
as
impracticable
a
cherished
design
of
confining
him
in
an
asylum
for
the
mentally
afflicted
until
such
time
as
he
should
have
regained
his
senses
was
spoilt
by
the
refusal
of
murchison
to
arrange
for
the
necessary
certificate
a
refusal
which
was
like
to
have
been
fraught
with
serious
consequences
to
that
gentleman
hopes
of
entering
the
captain
family
brooding
over
his
wrongs
the
captain
a
day
or
two
after
his
daughter
return
strolled
slowly
down
towards
the
harbour
it
was
afternoon
and
the
short
winter
day
was
already
drawing
towards
a
close
the
shipping
looked
cold
and
desolate
in
the
greyness
but
a
bustle
of
work
prevailed
on
the
conqueror
which
was
nearly
ready
for
sea
again
the
captain
gaze
wandered
from
his
old
craft
to
the
small
vessels
dotted
about
the
harbour
and
finally
dwelt
admiringly
on
the
lines
of
the
whaler
seabird
which
had
put
in
a
few
days
before
as
the
result
of
a
slight
collision
with
a
she
was
high
out
of
the
water
and
beautifully
rigged
a
dog
ran
up
and
down
her
decks
barking
and
a
couple
of
squat
figures
leaned
over
the
bulwarks
gazing
stolidly
ashore
there
was
something
about
the
vessel
which
took
his
fancy
and
he
stood
for
some
time
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
looking
at
her
in
a
day
or
two
she
would
sail
for
a
voyage
the
length
of
which
would
depend
upon
her
success
a
voyage
which
would
for
a
long
period
keep
all
on
board
of
her
out
of
the
mischief
which
so
easily
happens
ashore
if
only
jack
he
started
and
stared
more
intently
than
before
he
was
not
an
imaginative
man
but
he
had
in
his
mind
eye
a
sudden
vision
of
his
only
son
waving
farewells
from
the
deck
of
the
whaler
as
she
emerged
from
the
harbour
into
the
open
sea
while
amelia
kybird
tore
her
yellow
locks
ashore
it
was
a
vision
to
cheer
any
father
heart
and
he
brought
his
mind
back
with
some
regret
to
the
reality
of
the
anchored
ship
he
walked
home
slowly
at
the
kybirds
door
the
proprietor
smoking
a
short
clay
pipe
eyed
him
with
furtive
glee
as
he
passed
farther
along
the
road
the
hardys
father
and
son
stepped
briskly
together
altogether
a
trying
walk
and
calculated
to
make
him
more
dissatisfied
than
ever
with
the
present
state
of
affairs
when
his
daughter
shook
her
head
at
him
and
accused
him
of
going
off
on
a
solitary
frolic
his
stock
of
patience
gave
out
entirely
a
thoughtful
night
led
to
a
visit
to
wilks
the
following
evening
it
required
a
great
deal
of
deliberation
on
his
part
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
the
step
but
he
needed
his
old
steward
assistance
in
a
little
plan
he
had
conceived
for
his
son
benefit
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
paid
him
the
supreme
honour
of
a
call
the
honour
was
so
unexpected
that
wilks
coming
into
the
parlour
in
response
to
the
tapping
of
the
captain
stick
on
the
floor
stood
for
a
short
time
eyeing
him
in
dismay
only
two
minutes
before
he
had
taken
james
hardy
into
the
kitchen
to
point
out
the
interior
beauties
of
an
ancient
clock
and
the
situation
simply
appalled
him
the
captain
greeted
him
almost
politely
and
bade
him
sit
down
wilks
smiled
faintly
and
caught
his
breath
down
repeated
the
captain
left
something
in
the
kitchen
sir
said
wilks
be
back
in
half
a
the
captain
nodded
in
the
kitchen
wilks
rapidly
and
incoherently
explained
the
situation
to
hardy
sit
here
said
the
latter
drawing
up
a
comfortable
oak
chair
to
the
stove
see
he
do
know
that
we
know
each
other
explained
the
apologetic
steward
i
do
like
leaving
you
in
the
all
right
said
hardy
you
trouble
about
he
waved
him
away
and
wilks
still
pale
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
rejoining
the
captain
sat
down
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
and
waited
come
to
see
you
on
a
little
matter
of
business
said
his
visitor
wilks
smiled
then
feeling
that
perhaps
that
was
not
quite
the
right
thing
to
do
looked
serious
again
came
to
see
you
about
my
my
son
continued
the
captain
sir
said
wilks
jack
you
mean
only
got
one
son
said
the
other
unpleasantly
you
happen
to
know
of
any
wilks
almost
fell
off
the
edge
of
the
chair
in
his
haste
to
disclaim
any
such
knowledge
his
ideas
were
in
a
ferment
and
the
guilty
knowledge
of
what
he
had
left
in
the
kitchen
added
to
his
confusion
and
just
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
miss
nugent
came
briskly
in
her
surprise
at
seeing
her
father
ensconced
in
a
chair
by
the
fire
led
to
a
rapid
volley
of
questions
the
captain
in
lieu
of
answering
them
asked
another
do
you
want
here
have
come
to
see
sam
said
miss
nugent
seeing
you
here
how
are
you
sam
well
miss
replied
wilks
he
added
truthfully
after
a
moment
reflection
miss
nugent
dropped
into
a
chair
and
put
her
feet
on
the
fender
her
father
eyed
her
restlessly
came
here
to
speak
to
sam
about
a
private
matter
he
said
abruptly
matter
said
his
daughter
looking
round
in
surprise
about
private
matter
repeated
captain
nugent
you
come
in
some
other
kate
nugent
sighed
and
took
her
feet
from
the
fender
go
and
wait
in
the
kitchen
she
said
crossing
to
the
door
both
men
protested
the
captain
because
it
with
his
dignity
for
his
daughter
to
sit
in
the
kitchen
and
wilks
because
of
the
visitor
already
there
the
face
of
the
steward
indeed
took
on
such
extraordinary
expressions
in
his
endeavour
to
convey
private
information
to
the
girl
that
she
gazed
at
him
in
silent
amazement
then
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
passing
through
closed
it
with
a
bang
which
was
final
wilks
stood
spellbound
but
nothing
happened
there
was
no
cry
of
surprise
no
hasty
reappearance
of
an
indignant
kate
nugent
his
features
working
nervously
he
resumed
his
seat
and
gazed
dutifully
at
his
superior
officer
suppose
you
heard
that
my
son
is
going
to
get
married
said
the
latter
could
help
hearing
of
it
sir
said
the
steward
in
self
defence
going
to
marry
that
jezebel
of
kybird
said
the
captain
staring
at
the
fire
wilks
murmured
that
he
could
understand
anybody
liking
yellow
hair
and
more
than
that
the
general
opinion
of
the
ladies
in
fullalove
alley
was
that
it
was
dyed
going
to
ship
him
on
the
seabird
continued
the
captain
probably
be
away
for
a
year
or
two
and
in
the
meantime
this
girl
will
probably
marry
somebody
else
especially
if
she
does
know
what
has
become
of
him
he
ca
get
into
mischief
aboard
sir
said
the
wondering
wilks
master
jack
agreeable
to
going
sir
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
the
captain
sharply
sir
said
wilks
course
not
i
was
only
a
sort
o
wondering
how
he
was
going
to
be
persuaded
to
go
if
what
i
came
here
about
said
the
other
want
you
to
go
and
fix
it
up
with
nathan
you
want
to
be
crimped
sir
stammered
wilks
want
him
shipped
aboard
the
seabird
returned
the
other
smith
the
man
to
do
a
very
hard
thing
to
do
in
these
days
sir
said
wilks
shaking
his
head
with
signing
on
aboard
the
day
before
the
ship
sails
and
before
the
board
o
trade
officers
i
sure
it
a
wonder
that
anybody
goes
to
sea
at
leave
that
to
smith
said
the
captain
impatiently
seabird
sails
on
friday
morning
tide
tell
smith
i
arrange
to
meet
my
son
here
on
thursday
night
and
that
he
must
have
some
liquor
for
us
and
a
fly
waiting
on
the
wilks
wriggled
what
about
signing
on
sir
he
inquired
wo
sign
on
said
the
captain
be
a
stowaway
smith
must
get
him
smuggled
aboard
and
bribe
the
hands
to
let
him
lie
hidden
in
the
the
seabird
wo
put
back
to
put
him
ashore
here
is
five
pounds
give
smith
two
or
three
now
and
the
remainder
when
the
job
is
the
steward
took
the
money
reluctantly
and
plucking
up
his
courage
looked
his
old
master
in
the
face
a
life
afore
the
mast
sir
he
said
slowly
was
the
reply
make
a
man
of
him
besides
what
it
got
to
do
with
you
do
care
about
the
job
sir
said
wilks
bravely
that
got
to
do
with
it
demanded
the
other
frowning
go
and
fix
it
up
with
nathan
smith
as
soon
as
wilks
shuffled
his
feet
and
strove
to
remind
himself
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
independent
means
and
could
please
himself
known
since
he
was
a
baby
he
murmured
defiantly
do
want
to
hear
anything
more
from
you
wilks
said
the
captain
in
a
hard
voice
are
my
orders
and
you
had
better
see
that
they
are
carried
out
my
son
will
be
one
of
the
first
to
thank
you
later
on
for
getting
him
out
of
such
a
wilks
brow
cleared
somewhat
miss
kate
be
pleased
too
he
remarked
course
she
will
said
the
captain
i
look
to
you
wilks
to
manage
this
thing
properly
i
would
trust
anybody
else
and
you
never
disappointed
me
the
steward
gasped
and
doubting
whether
he
had
heard
aright
looked
towards
his
old
master
but
in
vain
for
the
confirmation
of
further
compliments
in
all
his
long
years
of
service
he
had
never
been
praised
by
him
before
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
and
began
to
discuss
ways
and
means
in
the
next
room
conversation
was
also
proceeding
but
fitfully
miss
nugent
consternation
when
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
hardy
was
difficult
of
concealment
too
late
she
understood
the
facial
contortions
of
wilks
and
resigning
herself
to
the
inevitable
accepted
the
chair
placed
for
her
by
the
highly
pleased
jem
and
sat
regarding
him
calmly
from
the
other
side
of
the
fender
am
waiting
here
for
my
father
she
said
in
explanation
deference
to
wilks
terrors
i
am
waiting
here
until
he
has
gone
said
hardy
with
a
half
smile
there
was
a
pause
hope
that
he
will
not
be
long
said
the
girl
you
returned
hardy
wilfully
misunderstanding
i
am
in
no
he
gazed
at
her
with
admiration
the
cold
air
had
heightened
her
colour
and
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
shamed
the
solitary
candle
which
lit
up
the
array
of
burnished
metal
on
the
mantelpiece
hope
you
enjoyed
your
visit
to
london
he
said
before
replying
miss
nugent
favoured
him
with
a
glance
designed
to
express
surprise
at
least
at
his
knowledge
of
her
movements
much
thank
you
she
said
at
last
hardy
still
looking
at
her
with
much
comfort
to
himself
felt
an
insane
desire
to
tell
her
how
much
she
had
been
missed
by
one
person
at
least
in
sunwich
saved
from
this
suicidal
folly
by
the
little
common
sense
which
had
survived
the
shock
of
her
sudden
appearance
he
gave
the
information
indirectly
a
long
stay
he
murmured
months
and
three
days
no
three
months
and
two
a
sudden
wave
of
colour
swept
over
the
girl
face
at
the
ingenuity
of
this
mode
of
attack
she
was
used
to
attention
and
took
compliments
as
her
due
but
the
significant
audacity
of
this
one
baffled
her
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
looking
at
the
fender
occasionally
glancing
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
to
see
whether
he
was
preparing
to
renew
the
assault
he
had
certainly
changed
from
the
jem
hardy
of
olden
days
she
had
a
faint
idea
that
his
taste
had
improved
keeps
his
house
in
good
order
said
hardy
looking
round
said
the
girl
why
he
never
married
said
hardy
musingly
my
part
i
ca
understand
a
man
remaining
single
all
his
life
can
you
never
think
of
such
things
said
miss
nugent
coldly
and
untruthfully
it
was
only
to
have
somebody
to
wait
on
him
and
keep
his
house
clean
pursued
hardy
with
malice
miss
nugent
grew
restless
and
the
wrongs
of
her
sex
stirred
within
her
have
very
lofty
ideas
on
the
subject
she
said
scornfully
i
believe
they
are
not
you
have
never
thought
about
such
things
you
know
he
reminded
her
no
doubt
you
have
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
to
the
hardy
admitted
it
frankly
only
since
i
returned
to
sunwich
he
said
by
the
spectacle
of
sam
forlorn
condition
i
suppose
said
miss
nugent
it
was
that
he
replied
miss
nugent
indignant
at
having
been
drawn
into
such
a
discussion
lapsed
into
silence
it
was
safer
and
far
more
dignified
but
at
the
same
time
she
yearned
for
an
opportunity
of
teaching
this
presumptuous
young
man
a
lesson
so
far
he
had
had
it
all
his
own
way
a
way
strewn
with
ambiguities
which
a
modest
maiden
had
to
ignore
despite
herself
course
wilks
may
have
had
a
disappointment
said
hardy
with
the
air
of
one
willing
to
make
allowances
believe
he
had
about
fifty
said
the
girl
carelessly
hardy
shook
his
head
in
strong
disapproval
man
should
have
more
than
one
he
said
firmly
man
of
any
strength
of
will
would
have
of
will
repeated
the
astonished
miss
nugent
their
eyes
met
hers
sparkling
with
indignation
his
full
of
cold
calculation
if
he
had
had
any
doubts
before
he
was
quite
sure
now
that
he
had
gone
the
right
way
to
work
to
attract
her
attention
she
was
almost
quivering
with
excitement
ideas
will
probably
change
with
age
and
disappointment
she
said
sweetly
shall
not
be
disappointed
said
hardy
coolly
take
care
of
miss
nugent
eyed
him
wistfully
and
racked
her
brains
for
an
appropriate
and
crushing
rejoinder
in
all
her
experience
and
it
was
considerable
considering
her
years
she
had
never
met
with
such
carefully
constructed
audacity
and
she
longed
with
a
great
longing
to
lure
him
into
the
open
and
destroy
him
she
was
still
considering
ways
and
means
of
doing
this
when
the
door
opened
and
revealed
the
surprised
and
angry
form
of
her
father
and
behind
it
the
pallid
countenance
of
wilks
for
a
moment
anger
deprived
the
captain
of
utterance
he
stammered
a
long
time
you
been
father
said
miss
nugent
in
a
reproving
voice
began
to
be
afraid
you
were
never
come
home
with
me
said
the
captain
recovering
the
command
was
given
in
his
most
imperious
manner
and
his
daughter
dropped
her
muff
in
some
resentment
as
she
rose
in
order
to
let
him
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
hardy
pick
it
up
it

he
stooped
for

as

forward
their
heads
met
with
a
crash
and
miss
nugent
forgot
her
own
consternation
in
the
joy
of
beholding
the
pitiable
exhibition
which
terror
made
of
wilks
very
sorry
said
hardy
as
he
reverently
dusted
the
muff
on
his
before
returning

the
infuriated
captain
as
he
held
the
door
open
for
his
daughter
miss
nugent
passed
through
followed
by
her
father
and
escorted
to
the
front
door
by
the
steward
whose
faint
was
utterly
ignored
by
his
injured
commander
he
stood
at
the
door
until
they
had
turned
the
corner
and
returning
to
the
kitchen
found
his
remaining
guest
holding
his
aching
head
beneath
the
tap
now
said
the
captain
sternly
to
his
daughter
dare
you
sit
and
talk
to
that
young
cub
eh
how
dare
you
was
there
when
i
went
in

his
daughter
did
you
come
out
then
demanded
her
father

afraid
of
disturbing
you
and
sam
said
miss
nugent
why
should
i
speak
to
him

the
captain
because
i
wo

liked
him

miss
nugent
in
affected
surprise
patted
him
on

the
captain
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
came
to
an
impressive
stop
in
the
roadway
but
miss
nugent
walked
on
she
felt
instinctively
that
the
joke
was
thrown
away
on
him
and
in
the
absence
of
any
other
audience
wanted
to
enjoy
it
without
interruption

and
sounds
which
she
ascribed

chapter
xi
jack
nugent
first
idea
on
seeing
a
letter
from
his
father
asking
him
to
meet
him
at
samson
wilks
was
to
send
as
impolite
a
refusal
as
a
strong
sense
of
undutifulness
and
a
not
inapt
pen
could
arrange
but
the
united
remonstrances
of
the
kybird
family
made
him
waver
go
said
kybird
solemnly
the
advice
of
a
man
wot
seen
life
and
go
who
knows
but
wot
he
a
thinking
of
doing
something
for
you
of
you
in
business
or
somethin

kybird
if
tries
to
break
it
off
between
you
and
i
hope
you
know
what
to
wo
do

said
her
husband
he
wants
to
see
me
said
nugent
him
come

in
my
house
retorted
kybird
quickly
englishman
is
his
castle
and
i
wo
him
in
not
asked
his
wife
the
two
families
is
to
be
connected
kybird
shook
his
head
and
catching
her
eye
winked
at
her
with
much
significance
it
your
own
way
said
kybird
who
was
always
inclined
to
make
concessions
in
minor
matters
it
your
own
way
but
do
blame
me
that
all
i
urged
on
by
his
friends
nugent
at
last
consented
and
in
a
reply
to
his
father
agreed
to
meet
him
at
the
house
of
wilks
on
thursday
evening
he
was
not
free
himself
from
a
slight
curiosity
as
to
the
reasons
which
had
made
the
captain
unbend
in
so
unusual
a
fashion
nathan
smith
put
in
an
appearance
at
six
on
the
fatal
evening
he
was
a
short
slight
man
with
a
face
mapped
with
tiny
wrinkles
and
a
pair
of
colourless
eyes
the
blankness
of
whose
expression
defied
research
in
conversation
especially
conversation
of
a
diplomatic
nature
smith
seemed
to
be
looking
through
his
opponent
at
something
beyond
an
uncomfortable
habit
which
was
a
source
of
much
discomfort
to
his
victims
we
are
then
wilks
he
said
putting
his
head
in
the
door
and
smiling
at
the
agitated
steward
in
said
wilks
shortly
smith
obliged
night
outside
he
said
taking
a
chair
wot
a
morning
it
be
for
a
sail
if
we
was
only
young
enough
is
that
terbacker
in
that
canister
there
the
other
pushed
it
towards
him
i
was
only
young
enough
and
silly
enough
said
the
master
producing
a
pipe
with
an
unusually
large
bowl
and
slowly
filling
it
nothing
i
should
enjoy
more
than
a
three
years
cruise
nothing
to
do
and
everything
of
the
you
made
all
the
arrangements
inquired
wilks
in
a
tone
of
cold
superiority
smith
glanced
affectionately
at
a
of
bulky
appearance
which
stood
on
the
floor
between
his
feet
ready
he
said
cheerfully
if
you
like
a
yourself
i
can
manage
it
for
you
in
two
twos
you
got
to
say
the
do

the

fiercely

retorted
wilks
who
by
no
means
relished
these
remarks
i
was
getting
as
much
out
of
it
as
you
are
i

smith
cried
the
other

this
why

smith
in
surprise

said
the
steward
sharply
ai
in
my
line

smith
approvingly
wot
a
thing
it
is
to
come
acrost
an
honest
man
wot
a
good
thing
it
is
for
the
he
stared
stonily
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
wilks
and
then
blinking
rapidly
shielded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
though
overcome
by
the
sight
of
so
much
goodness
the
steward
wrath
rose
at
the
performance
and
he
glowered
back
at
him
until
his
eyes
watered
past
six
said
smith
suddenly
as
he
fumbled
in
his
and
drew
out
a
small
folded
paper

i
made
a
start

eyeing
him
very
closely

said
smith
you
very
good

do
still
the
steward
made
no
move
thought

brought
the
stuff

you
he
remarked
smith
looked
at
him
with
mild
reproach
you
managing
this
affair
or
am
i
he
inquired
the
steward
went
out
reluctantly
and
drawing
a
quart
mug
of
beer
set
it
down
on
the
table
and
stood
watching
his
visitor
now
i
want
a
spoonful
o
sugar
a
spoonful
o
salt
and
a
spoonful
o
vinegar
said
smith
haste
afore
the
goes
off
of
wilks
withdrew
grumbling
and
came
back
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
of
time
considering
with
the
articles
required
said
the
other
been
quick
i
wish
i
could
move
as
quick
as
you
do
but
you
can
take
back
now

do
without

beer
demanded
the
incensed
wilks
the
beer
you
underhanded
swab
altered
my
mind
said
smith
not
liking
waste
and
seeing
by
your
manner
that
you
more
than
enough
already
tonight
i
drunk
it
there
is
another
man
in
sunwich
i
could
ha
played
that
trick
on
no
nor
a
boy
wilks
was
about
to
speak
but
thinking
better
of
it
threw
the
three
spoons
in
the
kitchen
and
resuming
his
seat
by
the
fire
sat
with
his
back
half
turned
to
his
visitor
cheerful
young
chap
is
said
smith
knowed
ever
since
he
was
a
baby
have
you

made
no

his
tormentor

strange

to
following

out
aboard
a
whaler
life
is
full
o
surprises

and
wot
a
big
surprise
it
would
be
to
you
if
you
could
wot
he
says
about
you
when
he
comes
to
obeying
orders
growled
the
other
right
said
smith
approvingly
as
he
drew
a
bottle
of
whisky
from
his
bag
and
placed
it
on
the
table
glasses
and
there
we
are
we
do
want
any
salt
and
vinegar
this
wilks
turned
a
deaf
ear
are
you
going
to
manage
so
as
to
make
one
silly
and
not
the
other
he
inquired
a
trade
secret
said
the
other
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
sent
the
something

take
afore
he
comes
and
i
shall
be
in
your
kitchen
looking
arter
you
know
wot

about
said
wilks
doubtfully
so
rejoined
the
other
trusts
you
and
of
course
he
take
anything
from
your
that
the
beauty
of
a
character
wilks
a
good
character
and
a
face
like
a
baby
with
grey
wilks
bent
down
and
taking
up
a
small
brush
carefully
tidied
up
the
hearth
as
not
if
my
part
in
it
gets
to
be
known
pursued
smith
mournfully
that
gal
of
kybird
scratching
my
eyes
out
or
sticking
a
into
me
i
had
that
once
the
longest
that
ever
was
made
i
should
he
shook
his
head
over
the
perils
of
his
calling
and
then
after
another
glance
at
the
clock
withdrew
to
the
kitchen
with
his
bag
leaving
wilks
waiting
in
a
state
of
intense
nervousness
for
the
arrival
of
the
others
captain
nugent
was
the
first
to
put
in
an
appearance
and
by
way
of
setting
a
good
example
poured
a
little
of
the
whisky
in
his
glass
and
sat
there
waiting
then
jack
nugent
came
in
fresh
and
glowing
and
wilks
after
standing
about
helplessly
for
a
few
moments
obeyed
the
captain
significant
nod
and
joined
smith
in
the
kitchen
better
go
for
a
walk
said
that
regarding
him
kindly
wot
the
wilks
acquiesced
eagerly
and
tapping
at
the
door
passed
through
the
room
again
into
the
street
a
glance
as
he
went
through
showed
him
that
jack
nugent
was
drinking
and
he
set
off
in
a
panic
to
get
away
from
the
scene
which
he
had
contrived
he
slackened
after
a
time
and
began
to
pace
the
streets
at
a
rate
which
was
less
noticeable
as
he
passed
the
kybirds
he
shivered
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
consumed
a
pint
or
two
of
the
strongest
brew
procurable
at
the
two
schooners
that
he
began
to
regain
some
of
his
old
he
felt
almost
maudlin
at
the
sacrifice
of
character
he
was
enduring
for
the
sake
of
his
old
master
and
the
fact
that
he
could
not
narrate
it
to
sympathetic
friends
was
not
the
least
of
his
troubles
the
shops
had
closed
by
the
time
he
got
into
the
street
again
and
he
walked
down
and
watched
with
much
solemnity
the
reflection
of
the
quay
lamps
in
the
dark
water
of
the
harbour
the
air
was
keen
and
the
various
craft
distinct
in
the
starlight
perfect
quiet
reigned
aboard
the
seabird
and
after
a
vain
attempt
to
screw
up
his
courage
to
see
the
victim
taken
aboard
he
gave
it
up
and
walked
back
along
the
beach
by
the
time
he
turned
his
steps
homewards
it
was
nearly
eleven
fullalove
alley
was
quiet
and
after
listening
for
some
time
at
his
window
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
passed
in
the
nearly
empty
bottle
stood
on
the
table
and
an
tumbler
accounted
for
a
large
dark
patch
on
the
as
he
entered
the
room
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
nathan
smith
with
a
broad
smile
on
his
face
stepped
briskly
in
over
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
went
off
like
a
lamb
no
trouble
nor
fighting
he
was
a
example
to
all
of
the
see
aboard
inquired
wilks
not
said
the
other
a
matter
o
fact
the
took
a
little
more
than
i
told
to
take
and
i
to
help
up
to
your
bed
accidents
will
but
he
be
all
right
in
the
morning
if
nobody
goes
near
leave
perfectly
quiet
and
when
comes
downstairs
give
a
strong
cup
o
my
bed
repeated
the
staring
wilks
as
right
as
rain
said
the
boarding
master
brought
down
a
pillow
and
blankets
for
you
and
put
in
the
kitchen
and
now
i
take
the
other
two
pound
ten
and
be
getting
off
it
ought
to
be
ten
pounds
really
with
the
trouble
i
wilks
laid
the
desired
amount
on
the
table
and
nathan
smith
placing
it
in
his
pocket
rose
to
go
disturb
till
he
sleep
out
mind
he
said
pausing
at
the
door
i
ca
answer
for
the
consequences
if
should
get
up
in
the
night
and
come
down
raving
mad
try
and
soothe
and
pleasant
he
closed
the
door
after
him
quietly
and
the
horrified
steward
after
fetching
the
on
tiptoe
from
the
kitchen
locked
the
door
which
led
to
the
staircase
and
after
making
up
a
bed
on
the
floor
lay
down
in
his
clothes
and
tried
to
get
to
sleep
he
dozed
off
at
last
but
woke
up
several
times
during
the
night
with
the
cold
the
lamp
burnt
itself
out
and
in
the
dark
he
listened
intently
for
any
sounds
of
life
in
the
room
above
then
he
fell
asleep
again
until
at
about
seven
in
the
morning
a
loud
crash
overhead
awoke
him
with
a
start
in
a
moment
he
was
sitting
up
with
every
faculty
on
the
alert
footsteps
blundered
about
in
the
room
above
and
a
large
and
rapidly
widening
patch
of
damp
showed
on
the
ceiling
it
was
evident
that
the
sleeper
in
his
haste
to
quench
an
abnormal
thirst
had
broken
the
water
jug
wilks
shivering
with
dread
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
irresolute
judging
by
the
noise
the
captain
was
evidently
in
a
fine
temper
and
smith
remarks
about
insanity
occurred
to
him
with
redoubled
interest
then
he
heard
a
hoarse
shout
the
latch
of
the
bedroom
door
clicked
and
the
prisoner
stumbled
heavily
downstairs
and
began
to
fumble
at
the
handle
of
the
door
at
the
bottom
trembling
with
excitement
wilks
dashed
forward
and
turned
the
key
and
then
retreating
to
the
street
door
prepared
for
instant
flight
he
opened
the
door
so
suddenly
that
the
man
on
the
other
side
with
a
sudden
cry
fell
on
all
fours
into
the
room
and
raising
his
face
stared
stupidly
at
the
steward
wilks
hands
dropped
to
his
sides
and
his
tongue
refused
its
office
for
in
some
strange
fashion
quite
in
keeping
with
the
lawless
proceedings
of
the
previous
night
captain
nugent
had
changed
into
a
most
excellent
likeness
of
his
own
son
chapter
xii
for
some
time
wilks
stood
gazing
at
this
unexpected
apparition
and
trying
to
collect
his
scattered
senses
its
face
was
pale
and
flabby
while
its
glassy
eyes
set
in
rims
of
red
eyelids
were
beginning
to
express
unmistakable
signs
of
suspicion
and
wrath
the
shock
was
so
sudden
that
the
steward
could
not
even
think
coherently
was
the
captain
upstairs
and
if
so
what
was
his
condition
where
was
nathan
smith
and
where
was
the
five
pounds
a
voice
a
husky
and
discordant
voice
broke
in
upon
his
meditations
jack
nugent
was
also
curious
does
all
this
mean
he
demanded
angrily
did
i
get
here
you
came
downstairs
stammered
wilks
still
racking
his
brains
in
the
vain
effort
to
discover
how
matters
stood
nugent
was
about
to
speak
but
thinking
better
of
it
turned
and
blundered
into
the
kitchen
sounds
of
splashing
and
puffing
ensued
and
the
steward
going
to
the
door
saw
him
with
his
head
under
the
tap
he
followed
him
in
and
at
the
right
time
handed
him
a
towel
despite
the
disordered
appearance
of
his
hair
the
improvement
in
nugent
condition
was
so
manifest
that
the
steward
hoping
for
similar
results
turned
the
tap
on
again
and
followed
his
example
head
wants
cooling
i
should
think
said
the
young
man
returning
him
the
towel
it
all
about
wilks
hesitated
a
bright
thought
occurred
to
him
and
murmuring
something
about
a
dry
towel
he
sped
up
the
narrow
stairs
to
his
bedroom
the
captain
was
not
there
he
pushed
open
the
small
lattice
window
and
peered
out
into
the
alley
no
sign
of
either
the
captain
or
the
ingenious
nathan
smith
with
a
heavy
heart
he
descended
the
stairs
again
said
nugent
who
was
sitting
down
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
be

and
the
know
that

nugent
is
it
i
did
go
home
i
did
understand
that
it
was
an
invitation
where

my
father
the
steward
shook
his
head
helplessly
was
when
i
went
out
last
night
he
said
slowly
i
came
back

room
was
empty
and
i
was
told
as

upstairs
in
my
he
was
in
your
bed
repeated
the
other
told
you
he
pushed
open
the
small
lattice
window
and
peered
out
into
the
alley
wilks
caught
his
breath
mean
i
told
myself

in
my
bed
he
stammered
when
i
came
in
i
see
these
on
the
floor
an
i
thought
as
the
put
them
there
for
me
and
taken
my
bed
nugent
regarded
the
litter
of
as
though
hoping
that
they
would
throw
a
little
light
on
the
affair
and
then
shot
a
puzzled
glance
at
wilks
should
you
think
my
father
wanted
your
bed
he
inquired
do
know
was
the
reply
thought
maybe
taken
a
little
more
than
ought
to
have
taken
but
it
all
a
to
me
i
more
astonished
than
wot
you
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
said
nugent
rising
and
pacing
the
room
came
here
to
meet
my
father
so
far
as
i
remember
i
had
one
drink
of
whisky
your
whisky
and
then
i
woke
up
in
your
bedroom
with
a
splitting
headache
and
a
tongue
like
a
piece
of
leather
can
you
account
for
it
wilks
shook
his
head
again
was
here
he
said
plucking
up
courage
not
go
an
see
your
father
seems
to
me
is
the
one
that
would
know
most
about
nugent
stood
for
a
minute
considering
and
then
raising
the
latch
of
the
door
opened
it
slowly
and
inhaled
the
cold
morning
air
a
subtle
and
delicate
aroma
of
coffee
and
herrings
which
had
escaped
from
neighbouring
invaded
the
room
and
reminded
him
of
an
appetite
he
turned
to
go
but
had
barely
quitted
the
step
before
he
saw
kingdom
and
his
sister
enter
the
alley
wilks
saw
them
too
and
turning
if
anything
a
shade
paler
supported
himself
by
the
kate
nugent
quickened
her
pace
as
she
saw
them
and
after
a
surprised
greeting
to
her
brother
breathlessly
informed
him
that
the
captain
was
missing
been
home
all
night
panted
kingdom
joining
them
do
know
what
to
they
formed
an
excited
little
group
round
the
steward
door
and
wilks
with
an
instinctive
feeling
that
the
matter
was
one
to
be
discussed
in
private
led
the
way
indoors
he
began
to
apologize
for
the
disordered
condition
of
the
room
but
jack
nugent
interrupting
him
brusquely
began
to
relate
his
own
adventures
of
the
past
few
hours
kingdom
listened
to
the
narrative
with
unexpected
calmness
she
knew
the
cause
of
her
nephew
discomfiture
it
was
the
glass
of
whisky
acting
on
a
system
unaccustomed
to
alcohol
and
she
gave
a
vivid
and
moving
account
of
the
effects
of
a
stiff
glass
of
hot
rum
which
she
had
once
taken
for
a
cold
it
was
quite
clear
to
her
that
the
captain
had
put
his
son
to
bed
the
thing
to
discover
now
was
where
he
had
put
himself
knows
something
about
it
said
her
nephew
darkly
something
know
no
more
than
a
babe
unborn
declared
wilks
last
i
see
of
the
was
at
this
table
opposite
would
hurt
a
fly
said
miss
nugent
with
a
kind
glance
at
her
favourite
where
is
the
governor
then
inquired
her
brother
did
he
go
home
last
night
he
has
never
stayed
out
he
has
said
kingdom
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap
you
were
children
he
came
home
at
eleven
next
morning
and
when
i
asked
him
where
he
been
he
nearly
bit
my
head
off
i
been
walking
the
floor
all
night
and
i
shall
never
forget
his
remarks
when
he
opened
the
door
to
the
police
who
come
to
say
they
could
find
him
a
ghostly
grin
flitted
across
the
features
of
wilks
but
he
passed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
mouth
and
became
serious
again
as
he
thought
of
his
position
he
was
almost
dancing
with
anxiety
to
get
away
to
nathan
smith
and
ask
for
an
explanation
of
the
proceedings
of
the
night
before
go
and
have
a
look
round
for
the
he
said
eagerly
ca
be
come
with
you
said
nugent
should
like
to
see
him
too
there
are
one
or
two
little
things
that
want
explaining
you
take
aunt
home
kate
and
i
follow
on
as
soon
as
there
is
any
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
a
little
way
and
a
head
appeared
only
to
be
instantly
withdrawn
at
the
sight
of
so
many
people
wilks
stepped
forward
hastily
and
throwing
the
door
wide
open
revealed
the
interesting
features
of
nathan
smith
do
you
do
wilks
said
that
gentleman
softly
just
walked
round
to
see
whether
you
was
in
i
got
a
message
for
you
i
did
know
you
got
he
stepped
into
the
room
and
tapping
the
steward
on
the
chest
with
a
confidential
finger
backed
him
into
a
corner
and
having
got
him
there
gave
an
expressive
wink
with
one
eye
and
gazed
into
space
with
the
other
thought
you
be
alone
he
said
looking
round
it
just
as
well
as
it
is
they
got
to
know
so
they
may
as
well
know
now
as
later
what
inquired
jack
nugent
abruptly
are
you
making
that
face
for
sam
wilks
mumbled
something
about
a
decayed
tooth
and
to
give
colour
to
the
statement
continued
a
series
of
contortions
which
made
his
face
ache
should
take
something
for
that
tooth
said
the
with
great
solicitude
do
you
say
to
a
glass
o
whisky
he
motioned
to
the
fatal
bottle
which
still
stood
on
the
table
the
steward
caught
his
breath
and
then
rising
to
the
occasion
said
that
he
had
already
had
a
couple
of
glasses
and
they
had
done
no
good
your
message
inquired
jack
nugent
impatiently
just
going
to
tell
you
said
smith
was
out
early
this
morning
strolling
down
by
the
harbour
to
get
a
little
appetite
for
breakfast
when
who
should
i
see
coming
along
looking
as
though
just
come
from
a
funeral
but
nugent
i
was
going
to
pass
but
he
stopped
me
and
asked
me
to
take
a
message
from
to
old
and
faithful
steward
has
he
gone
away
exclaimed
kingdom
old
and
faithful
steward
repeated
smith
motioning
her
to
silence
he
says
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
for
wot
took
place
last
night
and
him
too
tell
that
after
my
father
proved
too
much
for
me
i
walked
the
streets
all
night
and
now
i
ca
face
may
injured
son
and
family
yet
awhile
and
i
off
to
london
till
it
has
blown
over
what
it
all
about
demanded
nugent
do
you
get
to
the
point
far
as
i
could
make
out
replied
smith
with
the
studious
care
of
one
who
desires
to
give
exact
information
nugent
and
wilks
a
little
plan
for
giving
you
a
sea
interrupted
the
unfortunate
steward
look
nathan
smith
was
the
words
said
the
giving
him
a
glance
of
great
significance
you
going
to
take
away
or
add
to
wot
the
says
wilks
collapsed
and
avoiding
the
indignant
eyes
of
the
nugent
family
tried
to
think
out
his
position
seems
from
wot
the
told
me
continued
smith
there
was
some
objection
to
your
marrying
old
kybird
gal
so
and
wilks
after
putting
their
together
decided
to
get
you
and
after
giving
you
a
little
whisky
that
wilks
knows
the
trick
of
interrupted
the
unfortunate
steward
again
was
the
words
said
smith
coldly
you
it
they
was
going
to
stow
you
away
in
the
seabird
which
sailed
this
morning
however
when
the
see
you
overcome
his
melted
and
instead
o
putting
you
aboard
the
whaler
he
took
your
feet
and
wilks
your
and
after
a
great
deal
o
trouble
got
you
upstairs
and
put
you
to
miserable
scoundrel
said
the
astonished
nugent
addressing
the
shrinking
steward
infernal
old
reprobate
you
you
i
did
think
you
got
it
in
far
as
i
could
make
out
said
smith
kindly
wilks
was
only
obeying
orders
it
was
the
plan
and
wilks
was
aboard
ship
with
for
a
very
long
time
o
course
he
ought
to
ha
done
it
but
the
a
masterful
man
an
i
can
quite
understand
wilks
givin
way
i
dessay
i
should
myself
if
i
been
in
place
he
all
is
wilks
no
a
good
job
for
you
you
an
old
man
sam
said
nugent
can
hardly
believe
it
of
you
sam
said
miss
nugent
can
hardly
think
you
could
have
been
so
deceitful
why
we
trusted
you
all
our
the
unfortunate
steward
quailed
beneath
the
severity
of
her
glance
even
if
he
gave
a
full
account
of
the
affair
it
would
not
make
his
position
better
it
was
he
who
had
made
all
the
arrangements
with
smith
and
after
an
indignant
glance
at
that
gentleman
he
lowered
his
gaze
and
remained
silent
is
rather
odd
that
my
father
should
take
you
into
his
confidence
said
miss
nugent
turning
to
the
wot
i
thought
miss
said
the
complaisant
smith
i
there
was
nobody
else
and
he
wanted
message
to
go
for
fear
you
should
get
worrying
the
police
about
or
something
he
wants
it
kep
quiet
and
last
words
to
me
as
left
me
was
this
affair
gets
known
i
shall
never
come
back
tell
to
keep
it
quiet
do
think
anybody
will
want
to
go
bragging
about
it
said
jack
nugent
rising
it
is
sam
wilks
come
along
miss
nugent
followed
him
obediently
only
pausing
at
the
door
to
give
a
last
glance
of
mingled
surprise
and
reproach
at
wilks
then
they
were
outside
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
that
all
right
said
smith
easily
right
vociferated
the
steward
did
you
put
it
all
on
to
me
for
why
did
you
tell
your
part
in
it
ha
done
any
good
said
smith
ha
done
you
any
good
besides
i
did
just
wot
the
told
he
coming
back
inquired
the
steward
smith
shook
his
head
say
he
returned
could
say
between
you
an
me
i
expect
gone
up
to
have
a
fair
did
you
tell
me
last
night
he
was
inquired
the
other
orders
repeated
smith
with
relish
not
me
as
a
matter
o
fact
he
spent
the
night
at
my
place
and
went
off
this
wot
about
the
five
pounds
inquired
wilks
spitefully
ai
earned
know
i
ai
said
smith
mournfully
wot
worrying
me
it
like
a
gnawing
pain
in
my
side
think
it
conscience
biting
of
me
i
never
felt
it
before
or
d
think
it
sorrow
to
think
that
i
done
the
whole
job
too
cheap
you
think
it
out
and
let
me
know
later
on
so
he
waved
his
hand
cheerily
to
the
steward
and
departed
wilks
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
ignoring
the
cold
and
the
general
air
of
desolation
of
his
best
room
gave
way
to
a
fit
of
melancholy
which
would
have
made
edward
silk
green
with
envy
chapter
xiii
days
passed
but
no
word
came
from
the
missing
captain
and
only
the
determined
opposition
of
kate
nugent
kept
her
aunt
from
advertising
in
the
columns
of
the
london
press
miss
nugent
was
quite
as
desirous
of
secrecy
in
the
affair
as
her
father
and
it
was
a
source
of
great
annoyance
to
her
when
in
some
mysterious
manner
it
leaked
out
in
a
very
short
time
the
news
was
common
property
and
wilks
appearing
to
his
neighbours
in
an
entirely
new
character
was
besieged
for
information
his
own
friends
were
the
most
tiresome
their
open
admiration
of
his
lawlessness
and
their
readiness
to
trace
other
mysterious
disappearances
to
his
agency
being
particularly
galling
to
a
man
whose
respectability
formed
his
most
cherished
possession
other
people
regarded
the
affair
as
a
joke
and
he
sat
gazing
one
evening
at
the
two
schooners
at
the
insensible
figures
of
three
men
who
had
each
had
a
modest
at
his
expense
it
was
a
pretty
conceit
and
well
played
but
the
steward
owing
to
the
frenzied
efforts
of
one
of
the
sleepers
whom
he
had
awakened
with
a
quart
pot
did
not
stay
to
admire
it
he
finished
up
the
evening
at
the
chequers
and
after
getting
wet
through
on
the
way
home
fell
asleep
in
his
wet
clothes
before
the
dying
fire
he
awoke
with
a
bad
cold
and
pains
in
the
limbs
a
headache
was
not
unexpected
but
the
other
symptoms
were
with
trembling
hands
he
managed
to
light
a
fire
and
prepare
a
breakfast
which
he
left
untouched
this
last
symptom
was
the
most
alarming
of
all
and
going
to
the
door
he
bribed
a
small
boy
with
a
penny
to
go
for
murchison
and
sat
cowering
over
the
fire
until
he
came
you
got
a
bad
cold
said
the
doctor
after
examining
him
better
get
to
bed
for
the
present
you
be
safe
it
dangerous
faltered
the
steward
keep
yourself
warm
said
the
doctor
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
taking
his
patients
into
his
confidence
send
round
some
should
like
miss
nugent
to
know
i
bad
said
wilks
in
a
weak
voice
knows
that
replied
murchison
was
telling
me
about
you
the
other
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
neat
black
moustache
to
hide
a
smile
and
met
the
steward
indignant
gaze
without
flinching
mean
ill
said
the
latter
sharply
yes
said
the
other
you
get
to
bed
now
good
he
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
departed
wilks
sat
for
a
little
while
over
the
fire
and
then
rising
hobbled
slowly
upstairs
to
bed
and
forgot
his
troubles
in
sleep
he
slept
until
the
afternoon
and
then
raising
himself
in
bed
listened
to
the
sounds
of
stealthy
sweeping
in
the
room
below
chairs
were
being
moved
about
and
the
tinkle
of
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
announced
that
dusting
operations
were
in
progress
he
lay
down
again
with
a
satisfied
smile
it
was
like
a
tale
in
a
the
faithful
old
servant
and
his
master
daughter
he
closed
his
eyes
as
he
heard
her
coming
upstairs
pore
dear
said
a
voice
wilks
opened
his
eyes
sharply
and
beheld
the
meagre
figure
of
mrs
silk
in
one
hand
she
held
a
and
a
glass
and
in
the
other
paper
and
firewood
only
of
it
half
an
hour
ago
she
said
reproachfully
saw
the
doctor
boy
and
i
left
my
work
and
came
over
at
once
why
did
you
let
me
know
wilks
muttered
that
he
did
know
and
lay
crossly
regarding
his
attentive
neighbour
as
she
knelt
down
and
daintily
lit
the
fire
this
task
finished
she
proceeded
to
make
the
room
tidy
and
then
set
about
making
in
a
little
saucepan
lay
still
and
get
well
she
remarked
with
tender
playfulness
all
you
got
to
do
me
and
teddy
look
after
could
think
of
troubling
you
said
the
steward
earnestly
no
trouble
was
the
reply
do
think
i
leave
you
here
alone
helpless
do
you
was
going
to
send
for
old
jackson
if
i
did
get
well
said
wilks
mrs
silk
shook
her
head
at
him
and
after
punching
up
his
pillow
took
an
easy
chair
by
the
fire
and
sat
there
musing
edward
silk
came
in
to
tea
and
after
remarking
that
wilks
was
very
flushed
and
had
got
a
nasty
look
about
the
eyes
and
a
cough
which
he
did
like
fell
to
discoursing
on
nursing
is
the
principal
thing
said
his
mother
nursed
my
pore
dear
all
through
his
last
illness
he
could
bear
me
to
be
out
of
the
room
i
nursed
my
mother
right
up
to
the
last
and
your
pore
aunt
jane
went
off
in
my
wilks
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
his
eyes
shone
feverishly
in
the
lamplight
think
i
get
a
nurse
he
said
decidedly
said
mrs
silk
no
trouble
to
me
at
all
i
like
nursing
always
wilks
lay
back
again
and
closing
his
eyes
determined
to
ask
the
doctor
to
provide
a
duly
qualified
nurse
on
the
morrow
to
his
disappointment
however
the
doctor
failed
to
come
and
although
he
felt
much
better
mrs
silk
sternly
negatived
a
desire
on
his
part
to
get
up
till
the
doctor
been
she
said
firmly
could
think
of
do
believe
there
anything
the
matter
with
me
now
he
declared
odd
very
odd
that
you
should
say
that
said
mrs
silk
clasping
her
hands
repeated
the
steward
somewhat
crustily
do
you
mean
odd
was
the
very
last
words
my
uncle
benjamin
ever
uttered
in
this
life
said
mrs
silk
with
dramatic
impressiveness
the
steward
was
silent
then
with
the
ominous
precedent
of
uncle
benjamin
before
him
he
began
to
talk
until
scores
of
words
stood
between
himself
and
a
similar
ending
asked
to
be
remembered
to
you
as
went
off
this
morning
said
mrs
silk
pausing
in
her
labours
at
the
grate
much
obliged
muttered
the
invalid
did
time
to
come
in
pursued
the
widow
can
believe
what
a
lot
thinks
of
you
wilks
the
last
words
he
said
to
me
was
me
know
at
once
if
there
any
change
wilks
distinctly
felt
a
cold
clammy
sensation
down
his
spine
and
little
quivering
thrills
ran
up
and
down
his
legs
he
glared
indignantly
at
the
back
of
the
industrious
mrs
silk
very
fond
of
you
continued
the
unconscious
woman
it
not
a
father
but
he
seems
to
me
to
think
more
of
you
than
else
in
the
wide
wide
world
i
get
quite
jealous
sometimes
only
the
other
day
i
said
to
joking
like
you
better
go
and
live
with
if
you
so
fond
of
i
ha
laughed
wilks
uneasily
never
guess
what
said
then
said
mrs
silk
dropping
her
dustpan
and
brush
and
gazing
at
the
hearth
could
leave
you
i
guessed
the
steward
gruffly
now
exclaimed
mrs
silk
clapping
her
hands
you
nearly
guessed
it
well
there
i
never
did
i
would
told
you
for
anything
if
you
said
that
the
exact
words
what
did
say
was
without
you
mother
wilks
closed
his
eyes
with
a
snap
and
his
heart
turned
to
water
he
held
his
breath
and
his
brain
in
vain
for
a
reply
which
should
ignore
the
inner
meaning
of
the
fatal
words
something
careless
and
jocular
he
wanted
combined
with
a
voice
which
should
be
perfectly
under
control
failing
these
things
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
and
very
indeed
feigned
sleep
he
slept
straight
away
from
eleven
in
the
morning
until
edward
silk
came
in
at
seven
in
the
evening
feel
like
a
new
man
he
said
rubbing
his
eyes
and
yawning
do
see
no
change
in
your
appearance
said
the
comforting
youth
much
better
declared
his
mother
what
comes
o
good
nursing
some
nurses
would
woke
up
to
take
food
but
i
just
let
sleep
on
people
do
feel
hunger
while
they
she
busied
herself
over
the
preparation
of
a
basin
of
arrowroot
and
the
steward
despite
his
distaste
for
this
dish
devoured
it
in
a
twinkling
and
a
glass
of
milk
in
addition
failed
to
take
more
than
the
edge
off
his
appetite
shall
pull
through
said
mrs
silk
smiling
as
she
put
down
the
empty
glass
a
fortnight
he
be
on
it
is
a
matter
of
history
that
wilks
was
on
his
feet
at
five
the
next
morning
and
not
only
on
his
feet
but
dressed
and
ready
for
a
journey
after
such
a
breakfast
as
he
had
not
made
for
many
a
day
the
discourtesy
involved
in
the
disregard
of
the
doctor
instructions
did
not
trouble
him
and
he
smirked
with
some
satisfaction
as
he
noiselessly
closed
his
door
behind
him
and
looked
at
the
drawn
blinds
opposite
the
stars
were
paling
as
he
quitted
the
alley
and
made
his
way
to
the
railway
station
a
note
on
his
tumbled
pillow
after
thanking
mrs
silk
for
her
care
of
him
informed
her
that
he
was
quite
well
and
had
gone
to
london
in
search
of
the
missing
captain
hardy
who
had
heard
from
edward
silk
of
the
steward
indisposition
and
had
been
intending
to
pay
him
a
visit
learnt
of
his
departure
later
on
in
the
morning
and
being
ignorant
of
the
particulars
discoursed
somewhat
eloquently
to
his
partner
on
the
old
man
devotion
may
be
said
swann
taking
off
his
glasses
and
looking
at
him
you
do
think
captain
nugent
is
in
london
do
you
not
inquired
hardy
somewhat
startled
what
wilks
told
you
is
true
nathan
smith
knows
said
the
other
ask
do
expect
to
get
the
truth
out
of
him
do
you
inquired
hardy
superciliously
do
said
his
partner
serenely
when
i
got
it
i
shall
go
and
tell
them
at
equator
lodge
it
will
be
doing
those
two
poor
ladies
a
service
to
let
them
know
what
has
really
happened
to
the
walk
round
to
nathan
smith
with
you
said
hardy
should
like
to
hear
what
the
fellow
has
to
i
go
alone
said
his
partner
a
very
shy
man
painfully
shy
i
run
across
him
once
or
twice
before
he
almost
as
bashful
and
retiring
as
you
hardy
grunted
the
captain
is
in
london
where
is
he
he
inquired
the
other
shook
his
head
got
an
idea
he
replied
i
want
to
make
sure
kybird
and
smith
are
old
friends
as
nugent
might
have
known
only
he
was
always
too
high
and
mighty
to
take
any
interest
in
his
inferiors
there
something
for
you
to
go
he
bent
over
his
desk
again
and
worked
steadily
until
one
his
hour
for
lunching
then
he
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
after
a
comfortable
meal
sallied
out
in
search
of
smith
the
an
old
and
dilapidated
building
was
in
a
bystreet
convenient
to
the
harbour
the
front
door
stood
open
and
a
couple
of
seamen
lounging
on
the
broken
steps
made
way
for
him
civilly
as
he
entered
and
rapped
on
the
bare
boards
with
his
stick
smith
clattering
down
the
stairs
in
response
had
some
difficulty
in
concealing
his
surprise
at
the
visit
but
entered
genially
into
a
conversation
about
the
weather
a
subject
in
which
he
was
much
interested
when
the
began
to
discuss
the
object
of
his
visit
he
led
him
to
a
small
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
repeated
the
information
he
had
given
to
wilks
all
there
is
to
tell
he
concluded
artlessly
was
that
ashamed
of
hisself
he
laying
low
for
a
bit
we
all
make
mistakes
sometimes
i
do
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
swann
gratefully
quite
welcome
sir
said
the
now
said
the
visitor
musingly
for
the
repeated
smith
almost
hastily
for
to
find
the
captain
said
swann
in
a
surprised
voice
smith
shook
his
head
offend
the
bitter
if
you
go
to
the
police
about
sir
he
declared
last
words
to
me
was
this
kept
quiet
be
a
little
job
for
the
police
urged
the
shipbroker
do
have
much
to
do
down
here
they
be
as
pleased
as
worry
your
life
out
of
you
sir
said
the
other
do
know
what
they
like
a
little
excitement
returned
swann
do
suppose
they
trouble
me
much
but
they
turn
your
place
i
expect
still
that
ca
be
helped
you
know
what
fools
the
police
are
they
think
you
murdered
the
captain
and
hidden
his
body
under
the
boards
they
have
all
the
floors
up
ha
ha
ha
floors
up
do
seem
to
me
to
be
so
amusing
as
wot
it
does
to
you
remarked
smith
coldly
may
find
all
sorts
of
treasure
for
you
continued
his
visitor
a
very
old
house
smith
and
there
may
be
bags
of
guineas
hidden
away
under
the
flooring
you
may
be
able
to
a
gentleman
as
is
fond
of
his
joke
swann
returned
the
lugubriously
wish
i
got
that
way
of
looking
at
things
you
not
joking
smith
said
the
other
quietly
smith
pondered
and
stealing
a
at
him
stood
scraping
his
foot
along
the
floor
ai
nothing
much
to
tell
he
grumbled
mind
the
worst
favour
you
could
do
to
the
would
be
to
put
it
about
how
he
was
done
he
gone
for
a
little
trip
instead
of
son
that
trip
repeated
the
other
call
a
whaling
cruise
a
little
trip
no
sir
said
smith
in
a
shocked
voice
ai
so
bad
as
that
i
got
some
i
hope
he
just
gone
for
a
little
trip
with
old
pal
hardy
on
the
conqueror
kybird
idea
it
you
know
it
punishable
demanded
the
shipbroker
recovering
to
smith
great
surprise
his
visitor
sat
down
suddenly
and
began
to
laugh
tears
of
honest
mirth
suffused
his
eyes
and
dimmed
his
glasses
smith
regarding
him
with
an
air
of
kindly
interest
began
to
laugh
to
keep
him
company
smith
shook
his
head
and
became
serious
fell
into
own
trap
he
said
slowly
no
lor
for
he
only
get
laughed
at
the
idea
of
trying
to
get
me
to
put
little
amelia
kybird
young
man
away
why
i
was
swann
stared
at
him
and
then
with
a
friendly
departed
along
the
passage
he
stopped
and
retracing
his
steps
produced
his
and
offered
the
astonished
a
cigar
said
that
gentleman
as
he
watched
the
other
retreating
figure
and
dubiously
smelt
the
cigar
it
all
right
but
he
a
larky
sort
and
i
heard
of
exploding
i
give
it
to
kybird
in
chapter
xiv
captain
nugent
awoke
the
morning
after
his
attempt
to
crimp
his
son
with
a
bad
headache
not
an
ordinary
headache
to
disappear
with
a
little
cold
water
and
fresh
air
but
a
splitting
racking
affair
which
made
him
feel
all
head
and
dulness
weights
pressed
upon
his
and
the
back
of
his
head
seemed
glued
to
his
pillow
he
groaned
faintly
and
raising
himself
upon
his
elbow
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
up
with
a
sharp
exclamation
his
bed
was
higher
from
the
floor
than
usual
and
moreover
the
floor
was
different
in
the
dim
light
he
distinctly
saw
a
ship
forecastle
untidy
bunks
with
frouzy
bedclothes
and
shiny
hanging
from
the
bulkhead
for
a
few
moments
he
stared
about
in
mystification
he
was
certainly
ill
and
no
doubt
the
forecastle
was
an
hallucination
it
was
a
strange
symptom
and
the
odd
part
of
it
was
that
everything
was
so
distinct
even
the
smell
he
stared
harder
in
the
hope
that
his
surroundings
would
give
place
to
the
usual
ones
and
leaning
a
little
bit
more
on
his
elbow
nearly
rolled
out
of
the
bunk
resolved
to
probe
this
mystery
to
the
bottom
he
lowered
himself
to
the
floor
and
felt
distinctly
the
motion
of
a
ship
at
sea
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
staggered
to
the
door
and
holding
by
the
side
looked
on
to
the
deck
the
steamer
was
rolling
in
a
fresh
sea
and
a
sweet
strong
wind
blew
refreshingly
into
his
face
funnels
bridge
and
masts
swung
with
a
rhythmical
motion
loose
gear
rattled
and
every
now
and
then
a
distant
tinkle
sounded
faintly
from
the
steward
pantry
he
stood
bewildered
trying
to
piece
together
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
and
to
try
and
understand
by
what
miracle
he
was
back
on
board
his
old
ship
the
conqueror
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
her
identity
he
knew
every
inch
of
her
and
any
further
confirmation
that
might
be
required
was
fully
supplied
by
the
appearance
of
the
long
lean
figure
of
captain
hardy
on
the
bridge
captain
nugent
took
his
breath
sharply
and
began
to
realize
the
situation
he
stepped
to
the
side
and
looked
over
the
harbour
was
only
a
little
way
astern
and
sunwich
itself
looking
cold
and
cheerless
beyond
the
dirty
tumbling
seas
little
more
than
a
mile
distant
at
the
sight
his
spirits
revived
and
with
a
hoarse
cry
he
ran
shouting
towards
the
bridge
captain
hardy
turned
sharply
at
the
noise
and
recognizing
the
intruder
stood
peering
down
at
him
in
undisguised
amazement
back
cried
nugent
waving
up
at
him
on
earth
are
you
doing
on
my
ship
inquired
the
astonished
hardy
me
ashore
cried
nugent
imperiously
waste
time
talking
d
hear
put
me
the
amazement
died
out
of
hardy
face
and
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
anger
for
a
time
he
regarded
the
red
and
threatening
visage
of
captain
nugent
in
silence
then
he
turned
to
the
second
officer
man
is
not
one
of
the
crew
prowle
he
said
in
a
puzzled
voice
sir
said
prowle
did
he
get
aboard
here
captain
nugent
answered
the
question
himself
was
crimped
by
you
and
your
drunken
bullies
he
said
sternly
did
this
man
get
aboard
here
repeated
captain
hardy
ignoring
him
must
have
concealed
somewhere
sir
said
the
mate
is
the
first
i
seen
of
stowaway
said
the
captain
bending
his
brows
must
have
got
some
of
the
crew
to
hide
him
aboard
you
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
my
lad
who
are
your
confederates
captain
nugent
shook
with
fury
the
second
mate
had
turned
away
with
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
a
suspicious
hunching
of
his
shoulders
while
the
steward
who
had
been
standing
by
beat
a
hasty
retreat
and
collapsed
behind
the
you
do
put
me
ashore
said
nugent
restraining
his
passion
by
a
strong
effort
take
proceedings
against
you
for
crimping
me
the
moment
i
reach
port
get
a
boat
out
and
put
me
aboard
that
he
pointed
as
he
spoke
to
a
smack
which
was
just
on
their
beam
making
slowly
for
the
harbour
you
done
issuing
orders
said
the
captain
in
an
indifferent
voice
you
explain
what
you
are
doing
aboard
my
captain
nugent
gazed
at
the
stern
of
the
smack
sunwich
was
getting
dim
in
the
distance
and
there
was
no
other
sail
near
he
began
to
realize
that
he
was
in
for
a
long
voyage
awoke
this
morning
and
found
myself
in
a
bunk
in
vow
he
said
regarding
hardy
steadily
i
got
there
is
probably
best
known
to
yourself
i
hold
you
responsible
for
the
here
my
lad
said
captain
hardy
in
patronizing
tones
do
know
how
you
got
aboard
my
ship
and
i
do
care
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
it
was
not
intentional
on
your
part
but
either
the
outcome
of
a
drunken
freak
or
else
a
means
of
escaping
from
some
scrape
you
have
got
into
ashore
that
being
so
i
shall
take
a
merciful
view
of
it
and
if
you
behave
yourself
and
make
yourself
useful
you
will
not
hear
anything
more
of
it
he
has
something
the
look
of
a
seafaring
man
prowle
see
what
you
can
make
of
along
with
me
my
lad
said
the
grinning
prowle
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
the
captain
turned
with
a
snarl
and
clenching
his
huge
horny
fist
let
drive
full
in
the
other
face
and
knocked
him
off
his
feet
that
man
cried
captain
hardy
sharply
him
willing
men
sprang
forward
captain
nugent
views
concerning
sailormen
were
well
known
in
sunwich
and
two
of
the
men
present
had
served
under
him
he
went
forward
the
centre
of
an
attentive
and
rotating
circle
and
sadly
out
of
breath
was
bestowed
in
the
forecastle
and
urged
to
listen
to
reason
for
the
remainder
of
the
morning
he
made
no
sign
the
land
was
almost
out
of
sight
and
he
sat
down
quietly
to
consider
his
course
of
action
for
the
next
few
weeks
found
him
still
engrossed
in
thought
and
the
way
in
which
he
received
an
intimation
from
a
seaman
that
his
dinner
was
getting
cold
showed
that
his
spirits
were
still
unquelled
by
the
time
afternoon
came
he
was
faint
with
hunger
and
having
determined
upon
his
course
of
action
he
sent
a
fairly
polite
message
to
captain
hardy
and
asked
for
an
interview
the
captain
who
was
resting
from
his
labours
in
the
received
him
with
the
same
air
of
cold
severity
which
had
so
endeared
captain
nugent
himself
to
his
subordinates
have
come
to
explain
your
extraordinary
behaviour
of
this
morning
i
suppose
he
said
curtly
have
come
to
secure
a
berth
aft
said
captain
nugent
will
pay
a
small

captain
nugent
stared
at
him
with
his
lips
parted
three
times
he
essayed
to
speak
and
failed
then
he
turned
sharply
and
gaining
the
open
air
stood
for
some
time
trying
to
regain
his
composure
before
going
forward
again
the
first
mate
who
was
on
the
bridge
regarded
him
curiously
and
then
with
an
insufferable
air
of
authority
ordered
him
away
the
captain
obeyed
mechanically
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
inquiries
of
the
men
prepared
to
make
the
best
of
an
intolerable
situation
and
began
to
cleanse
his
bunk
first
of
all
he
took
out
the
bedding
and
shook
it
thoroughly
and
then
procuring

and
a

of

began
to

said
the
incensed
captain
said
the
aggrieved
bill
indeed
d
that
mates
a

look
at

the
captain
turned
as
though
he
had

stung

he
said
sharply
is
it
said

of
your
pardon
an
apologizing
for

graciously
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
mate
for
the
careful
and
tidy
way
in
which
you
cleaned
up
arter
the
captain
eyed
him
many
years
of
command
at
sea
had
given
him
a
fine
manner
and
force
of
habit
was
for
a
moment
almost
too
much
for
bill
and
his
friends
but
only
for
a
moment
going
to
keep
this
bunk
said
the
captain
deliberately
you
ai
mate
said
bill
shaking
his
head
you
believe
it
you
nobody
down
here
not
even
a
ordinary
seaman
i
afraid
you
to
clean
a
place
for
yourself
on
the
carpet
there
a
nice
corner
over
i
get
back
said
the
furious
captain
of
you
will
go
to
gaol
for
last
night
be
hard
on
us
said
a
mocking
voice
did
our
best
it
ai
our
fault
that
you
look
so
ridikerlously
young
that
we
took
you
for
your
own
you
was
in
that
state
that
you
could
contradict
us
said
another
man
it
is
your
bunk
said
the
captain
sternly
suppose
you
have
a
right
to
it
but
perhaps
you
sell
it
to
me
how
much
you
talking
bisness
said
the
highly
gratified
bill
turning
with
a
threatening
gesture
upon
a
speculator
opposite
do
you
say
to
a
couple
o
pounds
the
captain
nodded
o
pounds
money
down
said
bill
holding
out
his
hand
the
captain
examined
the
contents
of
his
pocket
and
after
considerable
friction
bought
the
bunk
for
a
pound
cash
and
an
i
o
u
for
the
balance
a
more
humane
man
would
have
shown
a
little
concern
as
to
his
benefactor
but
the
captain
never
gave
the
matter
a
thought
in
fact
it
was
not
until
three
days
later
that
he
discovered
there
was
a
spare
bunk
in
the
forecastle
and
that
the
unscrupulous
seaman
was
occupying
it
it
was
only
one
of
many
annoyances
but
the
captain
realizing
his
impotence
made
no
sign
from
certain
remarks
let
fall
in
his
hearing
he
had
no
difficulty
in
connecting
kybird
with
his
discomfiture
and
of
his
own
desire
he
freely
included
the
unfortunate
wilks
he
passed
his
time
in
devising
schemes
of
vengeance
and
when
captain
hardy
relenting
offered
him
a
cabin
aft
he
sent
back
such
a
message
of
refusal
that
the
steward
spent
half
an
hour
preparing
a
paraphrase
the
offer
was
not
repeated
and
the
captain
despite
the
strong
representations
of
bill
and
his
friends
continued
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
before
the
mast
chapter
xv
adolphus
swann
spent
a
very
agreeable
afternoon
after
his
interview
with
nathan
smith
in
refusing
to
satisfy
what
he
termed
the
idle
curiosity
of
his
partner
the
secret
of
captain
nugent
whereabouts
he
declared
was
not
to
be
told
to
everybody
but
was
to
be
confided
by
a
man
of
insinuating
address
and
appearance
here
he
looked
at
himself
in
a
to
miss
nugent
to
be
broken
to
her
by
a
man
with
no
ulterior
motives
for
his
visit
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
but
not
too
old
for
a
little
tender
sympathy
had
hoped
to
have
gone
this
afternoon
he
said
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
i
afraid
i
ca
get
away
have
you
got
much
to
do
hardy
said
his
partner
briskly
perhaps
you
would
mind
doing
my
work
for
me
so
that
i
can
go
said
swann
mildly
hardy
played
with
his
pen
the
senior
partner
had
been
amusing
himself
at
his
expense
for
some
time
and
in
the
hope
of
a
favour
at
his
hands
he
had
endured
it
with
unusual
patience
murmured
the
senior
partner
you
better
see
about
making
yourself
presentable
hardy
said
the
other
with
alacrity
as
he
took
off
his
coat
and
crossed
over
to
the
little
washstand
in
five
minutes
he
had
finished
his
toilet
and
giving
his
partner
a
little
friendly
pat
on
the
shoulder
locked
up
his
desk
he
said
at
last
repeated
swann
with
a
little
surprise
am
i
to
tell
them
inquired
hardy
struggling
to
keep
his
temper
them
repeated
the
innocent
swann
bless
my
soul
how
you
do
jump
at
conclusions
hardy
i
only
asked
you
to
tidy
yourself
for
my
sake
i
have
an
artistic
eye
i
thought
you
had
done
it
to
please
you
tired
of
this
nonsense
said
the
indignant
hardy
shall
be
swann
looked
him
over
carefully
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
his
patience
was
exhausted
told
him
the
result
of
his
inquiries
his
immediate
reward
was
the
utter
incredulity
of
hardy
together
with
some
pungent
criticisms
of
his
veracity
when
the
young
man
did
realize
at
last
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
he
fell
to
wondering
blankly
what
was
happening
aboard
the
conqueror
mind
about
that
said
the
older
man
a
few
weeks
you
have
got
a
clear
field
it
is
quite
a
bond
between
you
both
your
fathers
on
the
same
ship
but
whatever
you
do
do
remind
her
of
the
fate
of
the
kilkenny
cats
draw
a
fancy
picture
of
the
two
fathers
sitting
with
their
arms
about
each
other
waists
and
wondering
whether
their
children
hardy
left
hurriedly
in
fear
that
his
indignation
at
such
frivolity
should
overcome
his
gratitude
and
he
regretted
as
he
walked
briskly
along
that
the
diffidence
peculiar
to
young
men
in
his
circumstances
had
prevented
him
from
acquainting
his
father
with
the
state
of
his
feelings
towards
kate
nugent
the
idea
of
taking
advantage
of
the
captain
enforced
absence
had
occurred
to
other
people
besides
james
hardy
murchison
who
had
found
the
captain
despite
his
bias
in
his
favour
a
particularly
tiresome
third
was
taking
the
fullest
advantage
of
it
and
kybird
had
also
judged
it
an
admirable
opportunity
for
paying
a
first
call
kybird
who
had
not
taken
her
into
his
confidence
in
the
affair
protested
in
vain
the
lady
was
determined
and
moreover
had
the
warm
support
of
her
daughter
know
what
i
doing
she
said
to
her
husband
kybird
doubted
it
but
held
his
peace
and
the
objections
of
jack
nugent
who
found
to
his
dismay
that
he
was
to
be
of
the
party
were
deemed
too
trivial
to
be
worthy
of
serious
consideration
they
started
shortly
after
jem
hardy
had
left
his
office
despite
the
fact
that
kybird
who
was
troubled
with
asthma
was
suffering
untold
agonies
in
a
black
satin
dress
which
had
been
originally
made
for
a
much
smaller
woman
and
had
come
into
her
husband
hands
in
the
way
of
business
it
got
into
hers
in
what
the
defrauded
kybird
considered
an
extremely
unbusinesslike
manner
and
it
was
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
that
he
regarded
her
discomfiture
as
the
party
sallied
out
nugent
was
not
happy
kybird
in
the
snug
seclusion
of
the
back
parlour
was
one
thing
kybird
in
black
satin
at
its
utmost
tension
and
a
circular
hat
set
with
sable
ostrich
plumes
nodding
in
the
breeze
was
another
he
felt
that
the
public
eye
was
upon
them
and
that
it
twinkled
his
gaze
wandered
from
mother
to
daughter
are
you
staring
at
demanded
miss
kybird
pertly
was
thinking
how
well
you
are
looking
was
the
reply
miss
kybird
smiled
she
had
hoisted
some
daring
colours
but
she
was
of
a
bold
type
and
carried
them
fairly
well
i
the
woman
what
made
this
dress
gasped
kybird
as
she
stopped
with
her
hand
on
her
side
give
her
a
bit
o
my
never
saw
you
look
so
well
in
anything
before
ma
said
her
daughter
kybird
smiled
faintly
and
continued
her
pilgrimage
jem
hardy
coming
up
rapidly
behind
composed
his
amused
features
and
stepped
into
the
road
to
pass
hardy
said
nugent
home
am
calling
on
your
sister
said
hardy
bowing
jove
so
are
we
said
nugent
relieved
to
find
this
friend
in
need
go
together
you
know
kybird
and
miss
kybird
that
is
kybird
bade
him
along
do
and
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
as
stately
a
bow
as
the
black
satin
would
permit
and
before
the
dazed
jem
quite
knew
how
it
all
happened
he
was
leading
the
way
with
kybird
while
the
young
people
as
she
called
them
followed
behind
ai
looking
at
you
she
said
playfully
over
her
shoulder
we
trying
to
shut
our
eyes
to
your
goings
on
retorted
nugent
kybird
stopped
and
with
a
reached
for
him
with
her
umbrella
the
exertion
and
the
joke
combined
took
the
remnant
of
her
breath
away
and
she
stood
still
panting
had
better
take
hardy
arm
i
think
said
nugent
with
affected
solicitude
my
breath
explained
kybird
turning
to
the
fuming
young
man
by
her
side
can
get
along
for
it
i
much
obliged
to
you
i
hardy
with
a
vain
attempt
to
catch
jack
nugent
eye
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
and
with
his
fair
burden
on
his
arm
walked
with
painful
slowness
towards
equator
lodge
a
ribald
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
addressing
his
companion
as
kybird
told
her
not
to
hug
the
man
and
a
small
boy
whom
they
met
loudly
asseverated
his
firm
intention
of
going
straight
off
to
tell
kybird
by
the
time
they
reached
the
house
hardy
entertained
views
on
homicide
which
would
have
appeared
impossible
to
him
half
an
hour
before
he
flushed
crimson
as
he
saw
the
astonished
face
of
kate
nugent
at
the
window
and
pausing
at
the
gate
to
wait
for
the
others
discovered
that
they
had
disappeared
a
rooted
dislike
to
scenes
of
any
kind
together
with
a
keen
eye
for
the
ludicrous
had
prompted
jack
nugent
to
suggest
a
pleasant
stroll
to
amelia
and
put
in
an
appearance
later
on
wo
wait
for
said
kybird
with
decision
i
do
get
a
sit
down
soon
i
shall
still
clinging
to
the
reluctant
hardy
she
walked
up
the
path
farther
back
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
the
unfortunate
young
gentleman
saw
the
faces
of
murchison
and
kingdom
are
you
bella
inquired
kybird
with
kindly
condescension
kingdom
at
she
pushed
her
way
past
the
astonished
bella
and
followed
by
hardy
entered
the
room
kingdom
with
a
red
spot
on
each
cheek
rose
to
receive
them
ought
to
come
before
said
kybird
subsiding
thankfully
into
a
chair
i
such
a
bad
walker
i
i
see
you
are
very
well
thank
you
said
kingdom
stiffly
right
said
her
visitor
cordially
a
blessing
is
what
should
we
do
without
it
i
wonder
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
shook
her
head
at
the
prospect
there
was
an
awkward
lull
and
in
the
offended
gaze
of
miss
nugent
hardy
saw
only
too
plainly
that
he
was
held
responsible
for
the
appearance
of
the
unwelcome
visitor
was
coming
to
see
you
he
said
leaving
his
chair
and
taking
one
near
her
met
your
brother
coming
along
and
he
introduced
me
to
kybird
and
her
daughter
and
suggested
we
should
come
miss
nugent
received
the
information
with
a
civil
bow
and
renewed
her
conversation
with
murchison
whose
face
showed
such
a
keen
appreciation
of
the
situation
that
hardy
had
some
difficulty
in
masking
his
feelings
a
long
time
said
kybird
smiling
archly
there
when
young
people
are
keeping
company
they
forget
everything
and
everybody
they
did
trouble
about
me
if
it
been
for
giving
me
arm
i
should
never
got
there
was
a
prolonged
silence
murchison
gave
a
whimsical
glance
at
miss
nugent
and
meeting
no
response
in
that
lady
indignant
eyes
stroked
his
moustache
and
awaited
events
looks
as
though
your
brother
is
not
coming
said
hardy
to
miss
nugent
turn
up
interposed
kybird
looking
somewhat
morosely
at
the
company
do
notice
the
time
flies
that
does
go
murmured
kingdom
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
kybird
started
and
we
notice
it
too
at
our
age
she
said
sweetly
as
she
settled
herself
in
her
chair
and
clasped
her
hands
in
her
lap
ca
looking
at
you
my
dear
she
continued
looking
over
at
miss
nugent
such
a
wonderful
likeness
between
jack
and
you
do
you
think
so
kingdom
in
a
freezing
voice
said
that
she
had
not
noticed
it
course
said
kybird
glancing
at
her
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
has
to
rough
it
pore
feller
and
that
left
its
mark
on
i
sure
when
we
took
in
he
was
quite
done
up
so
to
speak
he
only
got
what
stood
up
in
and
the
only
pair
of
socks
he
got
to
his
feet
was
in
such
a
state
of
that
they
had
to
be
throwed
away
i
throwed
away
me
said
kingdom
do
look
like
the
same
feller
now
continued
the
amiable
kybird
living
and
good
clothes
worked
wonders
in
i
sure
if
he
been
my
own
son
i
could
done
more
for
and
as
for
kybird
he
like
a
father
to
me
said
kingdom
again
kybird
looked
at
her
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
call
her
a
poll
parrot
she
was
a
woman
as
a
rule
and
it
was
terrible
to
have
to
sit
still
and
waste
all
the
good
things
she
could
have
said
to
her
in
favour
of
unsatisfying
she
sat
smouldering
you
miss
the
very
much
she
said
at
last
much
was
the
reply
i
should
think
misses
you
retorted
kybird
unable
to
restrain
herself
must
miss
your
conversation
and
what
i
might
call
your
kingdom
turned
and
regarded
her
and
the
red
stole
back
to
her
cheeks
again
she
smoothed
down
her
dress
and
her
hands
trembled
both
ladies
were
now
regarding
each
other
in
a
fashion
which
caused
serious
apprehension
to
the
rest
of
the
company
am
not
a
great
talker
but
i
am
very
careful
whom
i
converse
with
said
kingdom
in
her
most
stately
manner
knew
a
lady
like
that
once
said
kybird
she
was
a
lady
she
added
meditatively
kingdom
fidgeted
and
looked
over
piteously
at
her
niece
kybird
with
a
satisfied
sniff
sat
bolt
upright
and
meditated
further
assaults
there
were
at
least
a
score
of
things
she
could
have
said
about
her
adversary
cap
alone
plain
straightforward
remarks
which
would
have
torn
it
to
shreds
the
cap
fascinated
her
and
her
fingers
itched
as
she
gazed
at
it
in
more
congenial
surroundings
she
might
have
snatched
at
it
but
being
a
woman
of
strong
character
she
suppressed
her
natural
instincts
and
confined
herself
to
more
polite
methods
of
attack
nephew
do
seem
to
be
in
no
hurry
she
remarked
at
length
there
direckly
gets
along
o
my
daughter
forgits
everything
and
really
do
think
he
is
coming
said
hardy
moved
to
speech
by
the
glances
of
miss
nugent
shall
give
him
a
little
longer
said
kybird
only
came
to
please
and
to
get
alone
is
more
than
i
can
miss
nugent
looked
at
hardy
and
her
eyes
were
soft
and
expressive
as
plainly
as
eyes
could
speak
they
asked
him
to
take
kybird
home
lest
worse
things
should
happen
it
be
far
out
of
your
way
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
the
opposite
direction
returned
hardy
firmly
i
got
i
do
know
said
kybird
addressing
the
room
in
general
a
wonder
to
me
well
once
is
enough
in
a
hardy
said
kate
nugent
again
in
a
low
voice
should
be
so
much
obliged
if
you
would
take
kybird
away
she
seems
bent
on
quarrelling
with
my
aunt
it
is
very
it
was
difficult
to
resist
the
entreaty
but
hardy
had
a
very
fair
idea
of
the
duration
of
miss
nugent
gratitude
and
besides
that
murchison
was
only
too
plainly
enjoying
his
discomfiture
can
get
home
alone
all
right
he
whispered
miss
nugent
drew
herself
up
disdainfully
murchison
looking
scandalized
at
his
brusqueness
hastened
to
the
rescue
a
medical
man
he
said
with
a
considerable
appearance
of
gravity
do
think
that
kybird
ought
to
go
home
not
inquired
hardy
grimly
of
it
breathed
the
doctor
why
do
you
take
her
retorted
hardy
all
on
your
way
i
have
some
news
for
miss
miss
nugent
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
mischievous
lights
appeared
in
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
at
the
carefully
groomed
and
fastidious
murchison
from
them
she
looked
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
kybird
was
stolidly
eyeing
kingdom
who
was
trying
in
vain
to
appear
ignorant
of
the
fact
you
very
much
said
miss
nugent
turning
to
the
doctor
sorry
began
murchison
with
an
indignant
glance
at
his
rival
as
you
please
said
the
girl
coldly
forgive
me
for
asking
you
really
wish
it
said
the
doctor
rising
miss
nugent
smiled
upon
him
and
hardy
also
gave
him
a
smile
of
kindly
encouragement
but
this
he
ignored
he
crossed
the
room
and
bade
kingdom
and
then
in
a
few
disjointed
words
asked
kybird
whether
he
could
be
of
any
assistance
in
seeing
her
home
sure
i
much
obliged
to
you
said
that
lady
as
she
rose
do
seem
much
use
for
me
waiting
for
my
future
i
wish
you
good
afternoon
i
can
understand
now
why
jack
did
with
this
parting
shot
she
quitted
the
room
and
leaning
on
the
doctor
arm
sailed
majestically
down
the
path
to
the
gate
every
feather
on
her
hat
trembling
in
response
to
the
excitement
below
of
him
said
hardy
glancing
from
the
window
with
a
triumphant
smile
said
miss
nugent
coldly
as
she
took
a
seat
by
her
aunt
is
the
news
to
which
you
referred
just
now
is
it
about
my
father
chapter
xvi
the
two
ladies
received
hardy
information
with
something
akin
to
consternation
the
idea
of
the
autocrat
of
equator
lodge
as
a
stowaway
on
board
the
ship
of
his
ancient
enemy
proving
too
serious
for
ordinary
comment
kingdom
usual
expressions
of
surprise
i
never
did
and
gracious
alive
died
on
her
lips
and
she
sat
gazing
helpless
and
at
her
niece
wonder
what
he
said
she
gasped
at
last
miss
nugent
who
was
trying
to
imagine
her
father
in
his
new
role
aboard
the
conqueror
paid
no
heed
it
was
not
a
pleasant
idea
and
her
eyes
flashed
with
temper
as
she
thought
of
it
sooner
or
later
the
whole
affair
would
be
public
property
had
an
idea
all
along
that
he
was
in
london
murmured
kingdom
that
nathan
smith
standing
in
sam
room
telling
us
falsehoods
like
that
he
never
even
you
said
that
you
kept
picturing
father
walking
about
the
streets
of
london
wrestling
with
his
pride
and
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
come
home
again
said
her
niece
maliciously
kingdom
fidgeted
but
before
she
could
think
of
a
satisfactory
reply
bella
came
to
the
door
and
asked
to
speak
to
her
for
a
moment
profiting
by
her
absence
hardy
leaned
towards
miss
nugent
and
in
a
low
voice
expressed
his
sorrow
at
the
mishap
to
her
father
and
his
firm
conviction
that
everything
that
could
be
thought
of
for
that
unfortunate
mariner
comfort
would
be
done
fathers
will
probably
come
back
good
friends
he
concluded
is
nothing
would
give
me
more
pleasure
than
that
and
i
think
that
we
had
better
begin
and
set
them
a
good
is
no
good
setting
an
example
to
people
who
are
hundreds
of
miles
away
said
the
miss
nugent
if
they
have
made
friends
they
do
want
an
example
set
in
that
case
they
have
set
us
an
example
which
we
ought
to
follow
urged
hardy
miss
nugent
raised
her
eyes
to
his
do
you
wish
to
be
on
friendly
terms
she
asked
with
disconcerting
composure
should
like
to
know
your
father
returned
hardy
with
perfect
gravity
kingdom
and
he
eyed
her
steadily
as
he
spoke
and
miss
nugent
despite
her
utmost
efforts
realized
with
some
indignation
that
a
faint
tinge
of
colour
was
creeping
into
her
cheeks
she
remembered
his
covert
challenge
at
their
last
interview
at
wilks
and
the
necessity
of
reading
this
persistent
young
man
a
stern
lesson
came
to
her
with
all
the
force
of
a
public
duty
she
inquired
softly
as
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
assumed
a
pensive
expression
admire
him
for
one
thing
as
a
fine
seaman
said
hardy
said
miss
nugent
i
always
had
a
great
liking
for
kingdom
he
continued
was
very
to
me
when
i
was
a
very
small
boy
i
remember
she
is
very
kind
and
the
baffled
miss
nugent
stole
a
glance
at
him
she
said
again
very
softly
very
motherly
said
hardy
without
moving
a
muscle
miss
nugent
pondered
and
stole
another
glance
at
him
the
expression
of
his
face
was
ingenuous
not
to
say
simple
she
resolved
to
risk
it
so
far
he
had
always
won
in
their
brief
encounters
and
monotony
was
always
distasteful
to
her
especially
monotony
of
that
kind
what
about
me
she
said
with
a
friendly
smile
said
hardy
with
a
gravity
of
voice
belied
by
the
amusement
in
his
eye
are
the
daughter
of
the
fine
seaman
and
the
niece
of
the
and
motherly
miss
nugent
looked
down
again
hastily
and
all
the
shrew
within
her
clamoured
for
vengeance
it
was
the
same
masterful
jem
hardy
that
had
forced
his
way
into
their
seat
at
church
as
a
boy
if
he
went
on
in
this
way
he
would
become
unbearable
she
resolved
at
the
cost
of
much
personal
inconvenience
to
give
him
a
fall
but
she
realized
quite
clearly
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
time
course
you
and
jack
are
already
good
friends
she
said
softly
assented
hardy
good
friends
that
i
have
been
devoting
a
lot
of
time
lately
to
considering
ways
and
means
of
getting
him
out
of
the
snares
of
the
should
have
thought
that
that
was
his
affair
said
miss
nugent
haughtily
too
said
hardy
do
want
him
to
marry
miss
for
the
first
time
since
the
engagement
miss
nugent
almost
approved
of
it
not
let
him
know
your
wishes
she
said
gently
that
would
be
you
do
want
them
to
marry
said
hardy
ignoring
the
remark
do
want
my
brother
to
do
anything
shabby
replied
the
girl
i
should
be
sorry
of
course
if
they
did
good
said
hardy
with
your
consent
i
shall
leave
no
stone
unturned
nugent
was
let
in
for
this
and
i
am
going
to
get
him
out
if
i
can
all
fair
in
love
and
war
you
do
mind
my
doing
anything
shabby
in
the
least
replied
miss
nugent
promptly
the
reappearance
of
kingdom
at
this
moment
saved
hardy
the
necessity
of
a
reply
conversation
reverted
to
the
missing
captain
and
hardy
and
kingdom
together
drew
such
a
picture
of
the
two
captains
fraternizing
that
miss
nugent
felt
that
the
millennium
itself
could
have
no
surprises
for
her
has
improved
very
much
said
kingdom
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
their
visitor
thoughtful
enough
agreed
her
niece
is
what
i
call
extremely
considerate
pursued
the
elder
lady
i
afraid
he
is
weak
anybody
could
turn
him
round
their
little
believe
they
could
said
miss
nugent
gazing
at
her
with
admiration
he
wanted
to
be
the
ice
thus
broken
hardy
spent
the
following
day
or
two
in
devising
plausible
reasons
for
another
visit
he
found
one
in
the
person
of
wilks
who
having
been
unsuccessful
in
finding
his
beloved
master
at
a
small
tavern
down
by
the
london
docks
had
returned
to
sunwich
by
no
means
benefited
by
his
change
of
air
to
learn
the
terrible
truth
as
to
his
disappearance
from
hardy
wish
they
shanghaid
me
instead
he
said
to
that
sympathetic
listener
said
the
other
staring
be
the
end
of
it
i
do
know
said
wilks
laying
a
hand
which
still
trembled
on
the
other
knee
got
about
that
she
saved
my
life
by
careful
nussing
and
the
way
she
shakes
at
me
for
risking
my
valuable
life
as
she
calls
it
going
up
to
london
gives
me
the
said
hardy
ca
marry
you
against
your
will
just
be
distantly
civil
to
can
you
be
distantly
civil
when
she
lives
just
opposite
inquired
the
steward
querulously
sent
teddy
over
at
ten
last
night
to
rub
my
chest
with
a
bottle
o
liniment
and
it
no
good
me
saying
i
all
right
when
she
been
spending
o
good
money
over
the
ca
marry
you
unless
you
ask
her
said
the
comforter
wilks
shook
his
head
in
the
alley
are
beginning
to
talk
he
said
dolefully
as
i
came
in
this
afternoon
old
george
lee
screwed
up
one
eye
at
two
or
three
women
wot
was
gossiping
near
and
when
i
asked
wot
got
to
wink
about
he
said
that
a
bit
o
blowed
in
his
eye
as
i
passed
it
sent
them
silly
creeturs
into
fits
soon
get
tired
of
it
said
hardy
wilks
still
gloomy
ventured
to
doubt
it
but
cheered
up
and
became
almost
bright
when
his
visitor
announced
his
intention
of
trying
to
smooth
over
matters
for
him
at
equator
lodge
he
became
quite
voluble
in
his
defence
and
attached
much
importance
to
the
fact
that
he
had
nursed
miss
nugent
when
she
was
in
long
clothes
and
had
taught
her
to
whistle
like
an
angel
at
the
age
of
five
felt
being
cut
adrift
by
her
more
than
anything
he
said
brokenly
years
i
sailed
with
the
and
served
faithful
and
this
is
my
hardy
pleaded
his
case
next
day
miss
nugent
was
alone
when
he
called
and
moved
by
the
vivid
picture
he
drew
of
the
old
man
loneliness
accorded
her
full
forgiveness
and
decided
to
pay
him
a
visit
at
once
the
fact
that
hardy
had
not
been
in
the
house
five
minutes
she
appeared
to
have
overlooked
go
upstairs
and
put
my
hat
and
jacket
on
and
go
now
she
said
brightly
very
kind
of
you
said
hardy
his
voice
expressed
admiring
gratitude
but
he
made
no
sign
of
leaving
his
seat
do
mind
said
miss
nugent
pausing
in
front
of
him
and
slightly
extending
her
hand
in
the
least
was
the
reply
i
want
to
see
wilks
myself
perhaps
you
let
me
walk
down
with
you
the
request
was
so
unexpected
that
the
girl
had
no
refusal
ready
she
hesitated
and
was
lost
finally
she
expressed
a
fear
that
she
might
keep
him
waiting
too
long
while
she
got
ready
a
fear
which
he
politely
declined
to
consider
we
see
said
the
marvelling
miss
nugent
to
herself
as
she
went
slowly
upstairs
got
impudence
enough
for
she
commenced
her
preparations
for
seeing
wilks
by
wrapping
a
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
reclining
in
an
with
a
novel
it
was
a
good
story
but
the
room
was
very
cold
and
even
the
pleasure
of
snubbing
an
intrusive
young
man
did
not
make
amends
for
the
lack
of
warmth
she
read
and
shivered
for
an
hour
and
then
with
chilled
fingers
lit
the
gas
and
proceeded
to
array
herself
for
the
journey
her
temper
was
not
improved
by
seeing
hardy
sitting
in
the
dark
over
a
good
fire
when
she
got
downstairs
afraid
i
kept
you
waiting
she
said
crisply
at
all
said
hardy
been
very
miss
nugent
repressed
a
shiver
and
crossing
to
the
fire
thoughtlessly
extended
her
fingers
over
the
blaze
afraid
you
cold
said
hardy
the
girl
looked
round
sharply
his
face
or
as
much
of
it
as
she
could
see
in
the
firelight
bore
a
look
of
honest
concern
somewhat
at
variance
with
the
quality
of
his
voice
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
absurdity
of
altering
her
plans
on
his
account
she
would
have
postponed
her
visit
to
the
steward
until
another
day
the
walk
to
fullalove
alley
was
all
too
short
for
jem
hardy
miss
nugent
stepped
along
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
anxious
to
get
to
the
stake
and
have
it
over
and
she
answered
in
monosyllables
when
her
companion
pointed
out
the
beauties
of
the
night
a
bitter
east
wind
blew
up
the
road
and
set
her
yearning
for
the
joys
of
wilks
best
room
very
cold
she
said
shivering
hardy
assented
and
reluctantly
quickened
his
pace
to
keep
step
with
hers
miss
nugent
with
her
chin
sunk
in
a
fur
boa
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
and
turning
briskly
into
the
alley
turned
the
handle
of
wilks
door
and
walked
in
leaving
her
companion
to
follow
the
steward
who
was
smoking
a
long
pipe
over
the
fire
looked
round
in
alarm
then
his
expression
changed
and
he
rose
and
stammered
out
a
welcome
two
minutes
later
miss
nugent
enthroned
in
the
best
chair
with
her
toes
on
the
fender
gave
her
faithful
subject
a
free
pardon
and
full
permission
to
make
hot
coffee
do
you
ever
try
and
deceive
me
again
sam
she
said
as
she
sipped
the
comforting
beverage
miss
said
the
steward
humbly
a
lesson
i
never
try
and
shanghai
anybody
else
agin
as
long
as
i
after
this
virtuous
sentiment
he
sat
and
smoked
placidly
with
occasional
curious
glances
divided
between
his
two
visitors
an
idle
and
ridiculous
idea
which
occurred
to
him
in
connection
with
them
was
dismissed
at
once
as
too
preposterous
for
a
sensible
steward
to
entertain
kingdom
well
he
inquired
well
said
the
girl
you
take
me
home
sam
you
shall
see
her
and
be
forgiven
by
her
miss
said
the
gratified
steward
what
about
your
foot
wilks
said
hardy
somewhat
taken
aback
by
this
arrangement
sir
said
the
unconscious
wilks
foot
the
bad
one
said
hardy
with
a
significant
glance
that
one
said
wilks
beating
time
and
waiting
further
revelations
you
think
you
ought
to
use
it
much
inquired
hardy
wilks
looked
at
it
or
to
be
more
exact
looked
at
both
of
them
and
smiled
weakly
his
previous
idea
recurred
to
him
with
renewed
force
now
and
several
things
in
the
young
man
behaviour
hitherto
disregarded
became
suddenly
charged
with
significance
miss
nugent
looked
on
with
an
air
of
cynical
interest
not
run
any
risk
said
hardy
gravely
shall
be
very
pleased
to
see
miss
nugent
home
if
she
will
allow
is
the
matter
with
it
inquired
miss
nugent
looking
him
full
in
the
face
hardy
hesitated
diplomacy
he
told
himself
was
one
thing
lying
another
he
passed
the
question
on
to
the
rather
badly
used
wilks
with
it
repeated
that
gentleman
glaring
at
him
reproachfully
got
shootin
pains
right
up
it
i
suppose
it
was
walking
miles
and
miles
every
day
in
london
looking
for
the
was
too
much
for
it
too
bad
for
you
to
take
me
home
sam
inquired
miss
nugent
softly
the
perturbed
wilks
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
a
sportsman
his
sympathies
were
with
hardy
but
his
duty
lay
with
the
girl
do
my
best
miss
he
said
and
got
up
and
limped
very
well
indeed
for
a
first
attempt
round
the
room
then
miss
nugent
did
a
thing
which
was
a
puzzle
to
herself
for
some
time
afterwards
having
won
the
victory
she
deliberately
threw
away
the
fruits
of
it
and
declining
to
allow
the
steward
to
run
any
risks
accepted
hardy
escort
home
wilks
watched
them
from
the
door
and
with
his
head
in
a
whirl
caused
by
the
night
proceedings
mixed
himself
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
to
set
it
right
and
drank
to
the
health
of
both
of
them
the
wind
had
abated
somewhat
in
violence
as
they
walked
home
and
moreover
they
had
their
backs
to
it
the
walk
was
slower
and
more
enjoyable
in
many
respects
than
the
walk
out
in
an
unusually
soft
mood
she
replied
to
his
remarks
and
stole
little
critical
glances
up
at
him
when
they
reached
the
house
she
stood
a
little
while
at
the
gate
gazing
at
the
starry
sky
and
listening
to
the
crash
of
the
sea
on
the
beach
is
a
fine
night
she
said
as
she
shook
hands
best
i
have
ever
known

chapter
xvii
the
weeks
passed
all
too
quickly
for
james
hardy
he
saw
kate
nugent
at
her
own
home
met
her
thanks
to
the
able
and
hearty
assistance
of
wilks
at
fullalove
alley
and
on
several
occasions
had
the
agreeable
task
of
escorting
her
back
home
he
cabled
to
his
father
for
news
of
the
illustrious
stowaway
immediately
the
conqueror
was
notified
as
having
reached
port
elizabeth
the
reply
confirmed
his
worst
fears
but
he
cheerfully
accepted
kingdom
view
that
the
captain
in
order
to
relieve
the
natural
anxiety
of
his
family
had
secured
a
passage
on
the
first
vessel
homeward
bound
captain
hardy
was
the
first
to
reach
home
in
the
early
hours
of
a
fine
april
morning
the
conqueror
steamed
slowly
into
sunwich
harbour
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
town
was
revelling
in
a
description
of
captain
nugent
first
voyage
before
the
mast
from
lips
which
were
never
tired
of
repeating
it
down
by
the
waterside
nathan
smith
found
that
he
had
suddenly
attained
the
rank
of
a
popular
hero
and
his
modesty
took
alarm
at
the
publicity
afforded
to
his
action
it
was
extremely
distasteful
to
a
man
who
ran
a
quiet
business
on
lines
and
disbelieved
in
advertisement
he
lost
three
lodgers
the
same
day
jem
hardy
was
one
of
the
few
people
in
sunwich
for
whom
the
joke
had
no
charms
and
he
betrayed
such
an
utter
lack
of
sympathy
with
his
father
recital
that
the
latter
accused
him
at
last
of
wanting
a
sense
of
humour
do
see
anything
amusing
in
it
said
his
son
stiffly
captain
hardy
recapitulated
one
or
two
choice
points
and
was
even
at
some
pains
to
explain
them
ca
see
any
fun
in
it
repeated
his
son
behaviour
seems
to
me
to
have
been
shouted
the
captain
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
nugent
was
your
guest
pursued
the
other
got
on
your
ship
by
accident
and
he
should
have
been
treated
decently
as
a
saloon
been
apologized
to
for
coming
on
board
i
suppose
suggested
the
captain
would
have
been
amiss
was
the
reply
the
captain
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
him
thoughtfully
ca
think
what
the
matter
with
you
jem
he
said
decent
ideas
that
all
said
his
son
scathingly
something
more
in
it
than
that
said
the
other
positively
do
like
to
see
this
business
with
you
jem
it
ai
natural
to
you
has
your
health
been
all
right
while
i
been
away
course
it
has
said
his
son
curtly
you
did
want
captain
nugent
aboard
with
you
why
did
you
put
him
ashore
it
would
have
delayed
you
long
think
of
the
worry
and
anxiety
you
caused
poor
holiday
for
her
growled
the
captain
has
affected
her
health
continued
his
son
besides
think
of
his
daughter
she
a
girl
and
all
sunwich
is
laughing
over
her
father
fell
into
his
own
trap
exclaimed
the
captain
impatiently
it
wo
do
that
girl
of
his
any
harm
to
be
taken
down
a
peg
or
two
do
her
good
knock
some
of
the
nonsense
out
of
not
the
way
to
speak
of
a
lady
said
jem
hotly
the
offended
captain
regarded
him
somewhat
sourly
then
his
face
changed
and
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
before
his
son
with
consternation
depicted
on
every
feature
do
mean
to
tell
me
he
said
slowly
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
thinking
anything
of
kate
nugent
not
demanded
the
other
defiantly
should
i
captain
hardy
whistling
softly
made
no
reply
but
still
stood
eyeing
him
thought
there
was
some
other
reason
for
your
consideration
besides
decent
ideas
he
said
at
last
did
it
come
on
how
long
have
you
had
it
hardy
in
a
studiously
unfilial
speech
intimated
that
these
pleasantries
were
not
to
his
taste
of
course
not
said
the
captain
resuming
his
seat
i
sorry
if
it
serious
jem
but
i
never
dreamt
you
had
any
ideas
in
that
quarter
if
i
had
i
have
given
old
nugent
the
best
bunk
on
the
ship
and
sung
him
to
sleep
myself
has
she
given
you
any
encouragement
know
said
jem
who
found
the
conversation
awkward
thing
said
the
captain
shaking
his
head
like
a
said
his
son
sharply
repeated
his
father
firmly
is
the
name
of
it
i
saw
it
once
at
newcastle
the
lovers
take
poison
and
die
across
each
other
chests
because
their
people
wo
let
marry
and
that
reminds
me
i
saw
some
in
the
kitchen
jem
whose
is
it
glad
to
be
the
means
of
affording
you
amusement
said
jem
grinding
his
teeth
captain
hardy
regarded
him
affectionately
easy
my
lad
he
said
equably
easy
if
i
known
it
before
things
would
have
been
different
as
i
did
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
she
a
pretty
girl
and
a
good
one
too
for
all
her
airs
but
i
afraid
she
too
fond
of
her
father
to
overlook
where
you
made
such
a
mess
of
things
broke
in
his
son
on
earth
you
two
old
men
could
said
the
startled
captain
you
are
in
the
early
fifties
my
lad
your
ideas
about
age
will
be
more
accurate
besides
nugent
is
seven
or
eight
years
older
than
i
became
of
him
inquired
jem
was
off
the
moment
we
berthed
said
his
father
suppressing
a
smile
do
mean
that
he
bolted
he
got
enough
starch
left
in
him
not
to
do
that
but
he
did
trespass
on
our
hospitality
a
moment
longer
than
was
necessary
i
heard
that
he
got
a
passage
home
on
the
columbus
he
knew
the
master
she
sailed
some
time
before
us
for
london
i
thought
he
have
been
home
by
it
was
not
until
two
days
later
however
that
the
gossip
in
sunwich
received
a
pleasant
fillip
by
the
arrival
of
the
injured
captain
he
came
down
from
london
by
the
midday
train
and
disdaining
the
privacy
of
a
cab
prepared
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
his
a
weaker
man
would
have
made
a
detour
but
he
held
a
direct
course
and
with
a
curt
nod
to
acquaintances
who
would
have
stopped
him
walked
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
home
tradesmen
ran
to
their
to
see
him
and
smoking
amphibians
lounging
at
street
corners
broke
out
into
sunny
smiles
as
he
passed
he
met
these
annoyances
with
a
set
face
and
a
cold
eye
but
his
views
concerning
children
were
not
improved
by
the
crowd
of
small
creatures
which
fluttered
along
the
road
ahead
of
him
and
hopeful
of
developments
clustered
round
the
gate
as
he
passed
in
it
is
the
pride
and
privilege
of
most
returned
wanderers
to
hold
forth
at
great
length
concerning
their
adventures
but
captain
nugent
was
commendably
brief
at
first
he
could
hardly
be
induced
to
speak
of
them
at
all
but
the
necessity
of
contradicting
stories
which
bella
had
gleaned
for
kingdom
from
friends
in
town
proved
too
strong
for
him
he
ground
his
teeth
with
suppressed
fury
as
he
listened
to
some
of
them
the
truth
was
bad
enough
and
his
daughter
sitting
by
his
side
with
her
hand
in
his
was
trembling
with
indignation
father
she
said
tenderly
a
time
you
must
have
wo
bear
thinking
of
said
kingdom
not
to
be
outdone
in
sympathy
do
think
of
it
said
the
captain
shortly
kingdom
sighed
as
though
to
indicate
that
her
feelings
were
not
to
be
suppressed
in
that
simple
fashion
anxiety
has
been
very
great
she
said
shaking
her
head
everybody
been
very
kind
i
sure
all
our
friends
have
been
most
sympathetic
i
could
go
outside
the
house
without
somebody
stopping
me
and
asking
whether
there
was
any
news
of
you
i
no
idea
you
were
so
popular
even
the
milkman
like
some
tea
interrupted
the
captain
roughly
is
when
you
have
finished
your
very
interesting
kingdom
pursed
her
lips
together
to
suppress
the
words
she
was
afraid
to
utter
and
rang
the
bell
master
would
like
some
tea
she
said
primly
as
bella
appeared

had
a
long
the
captain
started
and
eyed
her
fiercely
kingdom
her
good
temper
quite
restored
by
this
little
retort
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
gazed
at
him
with
renewed
sympathy
all
missed
you
very
much
said
kate
softly
we
had
no
fears
once
we
knew
that
you
were
at
i
suppose
some
of
the
sailors
were
kind
to
you
suggested
the
unfortunate
kingdom
are
rough
fellows
but
i
suppose
some
of
them
have
got
their
hearts
in
the
right
place
i
daresay
they
were
sorry
to
see
you
in
such
a
the
captain
reply
was
of
a
nature
known
to
kingdom
and
her
circle
as

he
drew
his
chair
to
the
table
as
bella
brought
in
the
tray
and
accepting
a
cup
of
tea
began
to
discuss
with
his
daughter

at

offensively
and
went
on
with
his
meal
a
long
silence

to

the

pushed

back

full
in
the
face

demanded
his

explained
you

the

and

up

down

he

sharply
at
his

demanded

down

sternly

with
a
view
to
avoiding
the
awkwardness
of
a
chance
meeting
with
any
member
of
the
nugent
family
hardy
took
the
sea
road
on
his
way
to
the
office
the
morning
after
the
captain
return
common
sense
told
him
to
leave
matters
for
the
present
to
the
healing
hand
of
time
and
to
cultivate
habits
of
by
no
means
agreeable
to
one
of
his
temperament
despite
himself
his
spirits
rose
as
he
walked
it
was
an
ideal
spring
morning
cool
and
sunny
the
short
turf
by
the
side
of
the
road
was
fragrant
under
his
heel
and
a
light
wind
stirred
the
blueness
of
the
sea
on
the
beach
below
two
grizzled
men
of
restful
habit
were
endeavouring
to
make
an
old
boat
waterproof
with
red
and
green
paint
a
long
figure
approaching
slowly
from
the
opposite
direction
broke
into
a
pleasant
smile
as
he
drew
near
and
quickened
his
pace
to
meet
him
out
early
said
hardy
as
the
old
man
stopped
and
turned
with
him
to
be
sir
said
wilks
darkly
early
and
late
and
more
often
than
not
getting
my
dinner
out
that
my
life
you
let
her
see
that
her
attentions
are
undesirable
inquired
hardy
gravely
ca
be
rude
to
a
woman
said
the
steward
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
could
my
life
would
ha
been
very
different
she
always
stepping
across
to
ask
my
advice
about
teddy
or
something
o
that
sort
all
last
week
she
kept
borrowing
my
so
at
last
by
way
of
letting
see
i
did
like
it
i
went
out
and
bought
one
for
herself
what
the
result
instead
o
being
offended
she
went
out
and
bought
me
a
couple
o
when
i
did
wear
she
pretended
it
was
because
i
did
like
the
colour
and
she
went
and
bought
two
more
i
wearing
one
he
shook
his
head
ruefully
and
hardy
glanced
at
a
tie
which
would
have
paled
the
glories
of
a
rainbow
for
some
time
they
walked
along
in
silence
going
to
pay
my
respects
to
nugent
this
afternoon
said
wilks
suddenly
said
the
other
knew
what
it
be
with
them
two
on
the
same
ship
continued
wilks
did
say
nothing
when
you
was
talking
to
miss
kate
but
i
knew
well
said
hardy
again
there
was
no
mistaking
the
significance
of
the
steward
remarks
and
he
found
them
somewhat
galling
it
was
all
very
well
to
make
use
of
his
humble
friend
but
he
had
no
desire
to
discuss
his
matrimonial
projects
with
him
a
great
pity
pursued
the
unconscious
wilks
as
everything
seemed
to
be
going
on
smoothly
but
while
there
life
there
a
smart
barge
over
there
said
hardy
pointing
it
out
wilks
nodded
shall
keep
my
eyes
open
this
afternoon
he
said
reassuringly
if
i
get
a
chance
of
putting
in
a
word
it
be
put
in
years
i
sailed
with
the
and
if
there
anybody
knows
his
weak
spots
it
he
stopped
as
they
reached
the
town
and
said
he
pressed
the
young
man
hand
sympathetically
and
a
wink
of
intense
artfulness
gave
point
to
his
last
remark
always
sam
wilks
cottage
he
said
in
a
husky
whisper
if
two
of
friends
should
to
meet
there
who
be
the
wiser
he
gazed
benevolently
after
the
young
man
retreating
figure
and
continued
his
stroll
his
own
troubles
partly
forgotten
in
the
desire
to
assist
his
friends
it
would
be
a
notable
feat
for
the
humble
steward
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
the
young
people
together
and
thereby
bringing
to
an
end
the
feud
of
a
dozen
years
he
pictured
himself
eventually
as
the
trusted
friend
and
adviser
of
both
families
and
in
one
daring
flight
of
fancy
saw
himself
hobnobbing
with
the
two
captains
over
pipes
and
whisky
neatly
dressed
and
carrying
a
small
offering
of
wallflowers
he
set
out
that
afternoon
to
call
on
his
old
master
giving
as
he
walked
the
last
touches
to
a
little
speech
of
welcome
which
he
had
prepared
during
dinner
it
was
a
happy
effort
albeit
a
trifle
laboured
but
captain
nugent
speech
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
gave
it
no
chance
he
started
the
moment
the
bowing
wilks
entered
the
room
his
voice
rising
gradually
from
low
bitter
tones
to
a
hurricane
note
which
bella
could
hear
in
the
kitchen
without
even
leaving
her
chair
wilks
stood
dazed
and
speechless
before
him
holding
the
wallflowers
in
one
hand
and
his
cap
in
the
other
in
this
attitude
he
listened
to
a
description
of
his
character
drawn
with
the
loving
skill
of
an
artist
whose
whole
heart
was
in
his
work
and
who
seemed
never
tired
of
filling
in
details
you
ever
have
the
hardihood
to
come
to
my
house
again
he
concluded
break
every
bone
in
your
misshapen
body
get
wilks
turned
and
groped
his
way
to
the
door
then
he
went
a
little
way
back
with
some
idea
of
defending
himself
but
the
door
of
the
room
was
slammed
in
his
face
he
walked
slowly
down
the
path
to
the
road
and
stood
there
for
some
time
in
helpless
bewilderment
in
all
his
sixty
years
of
life
his
feelings
had
never
been
so
outraged
his
cap
was
still
in
his
hand
and
with
a
helpless
gesture
he
put
it
on
and
scattered
his
floral
offering
in
the
road
then
he
made
a
for
the
two
schooners
though
convivial
by
nature
and
ever
free
with
his
money
he
sat
there
drinking
alone
in
silent
misery
men
came
and
went
but
he
still
sat
there
noting
with
mournful
pride
the
attention
caused
by
his
unusual
bearing
to
casual
inquiries
he
shook
his
head
to
more
direct
ones
he
only
sighed
heavily
and
applied
himself
to
his
liquor
curiosity
increased
with
numbers
as
the
day
wore
on
and
the
steward
determined
to
be
miserable
fought
manfully
against
an
cheerfulness
due
to
the
warming
properties
of
the
ale
within
you
ai
lost
nobody
sam
said
a
discomfited
inquirer
at
last
wilks
shook
his
head
look
as
though
you
lost
a
shilling
and
found
a
pursued
the
other
a
what
inquired
wilks
wrinkling
his
forehead
said
his
friend
did
said
wilks
the
other
attempted
to
explain
and
was
ably
assisted
by
two
friends
but
without
avail
the
impression
left
on
wilks
mind
being
that
somebody
had
got
a
shilling
of
his
he
waxed
exceeding
bitter
and
said
that
he
had
been
missing
shillings
for
a
long
time
labourin
under
a
mistake
sam
said
the
first
speaker
wilks
laughed
scornfully
and
essayed
a
sneer
while
his
friends
regarding
his
contortions
with
some
anxiety
expressed
a
fear
that
he
was
not
quite
himself
to
this
suggestion
the
steward
deigned
no
reply
and
turning
to
the
landlord
bade
him
replenish
his
mug
enough
wilks
said
that
gentleman
who
had
been
watching
him
for
some
time
wilks
gazing
at
him
mistily
did
not
at
first
understand
the
full
purport
of
this
remark
but
when
he
did
his
wrath
was
so
majestic
and
his
remarks
about
the
quality
of
the
brew
so
libellous
that
the
landlord
lost
all
patience
get
off
home
he
said
sharply
t
me
said
wilks
impressively
do
want
no
words
with
you
said
the
get
off
home
while
you
right
sam
said
one
of
the
company
putting
his
hand
on
the
steward
arm
take
his
wilks
shook
the
hand
off
and
eyed
his
adviser
ferociously
then
he
took
a
glass
from
the
counter
and
smashed
it
on
the
floor
the
next
moment
the
bar
was
in
a
ferment
and
the
landlord
gripping
wilks
round
the
middle
skilfully
piloted
him
to
the
door
and
thrust
him
into
the
road
the
strong
air
blowing
from
the
sea
disordered
the
steward
faculties
still
further
his
treatment
inside
was
forgotten
and
leaning
against
the
front
of
the
tavern
he
stood
gazing
at
marvels
ships
in
the
harbour
suddenly
quitted
their
native
element
and
were
drawn
up
into
the
firmament
nobody
passed
but
twins
wilks
said
a
voice
the
steward
peered
down
at
the
voice
at
first
he
thought
it
was
another
case
of
twins
but
looking
close
he
saw
that
it
was
edward
silk
alone
he
saluted
him
graciously
and
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
sky
sought
to
attract
his
attention
to
the
ships
there
said
the
unconscious
mr
silk
sign
of
a
fine
day
you
going
my
way
wilks
smiled
and
detaching
himself
from
the
tavern
with
some
difficulty
just
saved
mr
silk
from
a
terrible
fall
by
clutching
him
forcibly
round
the
neck
the
ingratitude
of
mr
silk
was
a
rebuff
to
a
nature
which
was
at
that
moment
overflowing
with
good
will
for
a
moment
the
steward
was
half
inclined
to
let
him
go
home
alone
but
the
reflection
that
he
would
never
get
there
softened
him
yourself
he
said
gravely
on
the
road
as
they
walked
rose
up
in
imitation
of
the
shipping
but
wilks
knew
now
the
explanation
teddy
silk
was
intoxicated
very
gently
he
leaned
towards
the
erring
youth
and
wagged
his
head
at
him
you
going
to
hold
up
or
are
you
demanded
mr
silk
shortly
the
steward
waived
the
question
he
knew
from
experience
the
futility
of
arguing
with
men
in
drink
the
great
thing
was
to
get
teddy
silk
home
not
to
argue
with
him
he
smiled
to
himself
and
with
a
sudden
movement
pinned
him
up
against
the
wall
in
time
to
arrest
another
fall
with
frequent
halts
by
the
way
during
which
the
shortness
of
mr
silk
temper
furnished
wilks
with
the
texts
of
several
sermons
none
of
which
he
finished
they
at
last
reached
fullalove
alley
and
the
steward
with
a
brief
exhortation
to
his
charge
to
hold
his
head
up
bore
down
on
mrs
silk
who
was
sitting
in
her
doorway
brought
he
said
steadying
himself
against
the
doorpost
said
the
bewildered
mrs
silk
say
anything
to
entreated
wilks
sake
thing
might
been
like
that
all
the
way
said
mr
silk
regarding
the
steward
with
much
disfavour
do
know
why
i
troubled
about
him
i
roun
pursued
the
imaginative
wilks
up
sure
it
very
kind
of
you
wilks
said
the
widow
as
she
glanced
at
a
little
knot
of
neighbours
standing
near
you
come
inside
for
a
minute
or
two
she
moved
the
chair
to
let
him
pass
and
wilks
still
keeping
the
restraining
hand
of
age
on
the
shoulder
of
intemperate
youth
passed
in
and
stood
smiling
amiably
while
mrs
silk
lit
the
lamp
and
placed
it
in
the
centre
of
the
table
which
was
laid
for
supper
the
light
shone
on
a
knuckle
of
boiled
pork
a
loaf
and
a
wedge
of
cheese
suppose
you
wo
stay
and
pick
a
bit
o
supper
with
us
said
mrs
silk
not
inquired
wilks
sure
if
i
had
known
said
mrs
silk
as
she
piloted
him
to
a
seat
something
nice
there
now
if
i
been
and
forgot
the
she
left
the
table
and
went
into
the
kitchen
and
wilks
eyes
glistened
as
she
returned
with
a
large
brown
jug
full
of
foaming
ale
and
filled
his
glass
must
any
he
said
sharply
as
she
prepared
to
fill
that
gentleman
glass
a
glass
she
said
winsomely
a
drop
said
wilks
firmly
mrs
silk
hesitated
and
screwing
up
her
forehead
glanced
significantly
at
her
son
some
she
whispered
me
the
jug
said
mr
silk
indignantly
are
you
listening
to
for
ca
you
see
what
the
matter
with
to
it
said
wilks
it
he
thumped
the
table
emphatically
with
his
hand
and
before
her
indignant
son
could
interfere
mrs
silk
had
obeyed
it
was
the
last
straw
edward
silk
rose
to
his
feet
with
tremendous
effect
and
first
thrusting
his
plate
violently
away
from
him
went
out
into
the
night
slamming
the
door
behind
him
with
such
violence
that
the
startled
wilks
was
nearly
blown
out
of
his
chair
do
mean
nothing
said
mrs
silk
turning
a
rather
scared
face
to
the
steward
a
bit
jealous
of
you
i
wilks
shook
his
head
truth
to
tell
he
was
rather
at
a
loss
to
know
exactly
what
had
happened
then
there
love
affair
sighed
mrs
silk
never
get
over
the
loss
of
amelia
kybird
i
always
know
when
seen
her
he
that
miserable
there
no
getting
a
word
out
of
wilks
smiled
vaguely
and
went
on
with
his
supper
and
the
meal
finished
allowed
himself
to
be
installed
in
an
while
his
hostess
cleared
the
table
he
sat
and
smoked
in
high
good
humour
with
himself
the
occasional
remarks
he
made
being
received
with
an
enthusiasm
which
they
seldom
provoked
elsewhere
should
like
t
sit
all
night
he
said
at
last
do
believe
it
said
mrs
silk
playfully
t
sit
all
night
repeated
wilks
somewhat
sternly
nex
day
all
day
after
day
after
that
day
mrs
silk
eyed
him
softly
would
you
like
to
sit
here
all
that
time
she
inquired
in
a
low
voice
said
wilks
simply
i
do
feel
if
i
can
stand
he
closed
his
eyes
on
the
indignant
mrs
silk
and
fell
fast
asleep
it
was
a
sound
sleep
and
dreamless
and
only
troubled
by
the
occasional
ineffectual
attempts
of
his
hostess
to
arouse
him
she
gave
up
the
attempt
at
last
and
taking
up
a
pair
of
socks
sat
working
thoughtfully
the
other
side
of
the
the
steward
awoke
an
hour
or
two
later
and
after
what
seemed
a
terrible
struggle
found
himself
standing
at
the
open
door
with
the
cold
night
air
blowing
in
his
face
and
a
voice
which
by
an
effort
of
memory
he
identified
as
that
of
edward
silk
inviting
him
go
home
and
lose
no
time
about
then
the
door
slammed
behind
him
and
he
stood
balancing
himself
with
some
difficulty
on
the
step
wondering
what
had
happened
by
the
time
he
had
walked
up
and
down
the
deserted
alley
three
or
four
times
light
was
vouchsafed
to
him
and
shivering
slightly
he
found
his
own
door
and
went
to
bed
chapter
xix
any
hopes
which
hardy
might
have
entertained
as
to
the
attitude
of
miss
nugent
were
dispelled
the
first
time
he
saw
her
that
dutiful
daughter
of
a
sire
favouring
him
with
a
bow
which
was
exactly
half
an
inch
in
depth
and
then
promptly
bestowing
her
gaze
elsewhere
he
passed
captain
nugent
next
day
and
for
a
week
afterwards
he
had
only
to
close
his
eyes
to
see
in
all
its
appalling
virulence
the
glare
with
which
that
gentleman
had
acknowledged
his
attempt
at
recognition
he
fared
no
better
in
fullalove
alley
a
visit
to
wilks
eliciting
the
fact
that
that
delectable
thoroughfare
had
been
put
out
of
bounds
for
miss
nugent
moreover
wilks
was
full
of
his
own
troubles
and
anxious
for
any
comfort
and
advice
that
could
be
given
to
him
all
the
alley
knew
that
mrs
silk
had
quarrelled
with
her
son
over
the
steward
and
without
knowing
the
facts
spoke
their
mind
with
painful
freedom
concerning
them
and
teddy
do
speak
to
each
other
now
said
wilks
gloomily
to
people
talk
you
think
it
was
my
hardy
gave
him
what
comfort
he
could
he
even
went
the
length
of
saying
that
mrs
silk
was
a
fine
woman
acts
like
a
suffering
martyr
exclaimed
wilks
comes
over
dropping
hints
that
people
are
talking
about
us
and
that
they
ask
awkward
questions
pretending
to
misunderstand
every
time
is
enough
to
send
me
crazy
and
she
so
sudden
in
what
she
says
there
no
being
up
to
this
morning
she
asked
me
if
i
should
be
sorry
if
she
did
you
say
inquired
his
listener
said
admitted
wilks
reluctantly
could
say
anything
else
but
i
said
that
she
was
to
let
my
feelings

sailed
a
day
or
two
later
and
after
that
nothing
happened
equator
lodge
was
an
impregnable
fortress
and
the
only
member
of
the
garrison
he
saw
in
a
fortnight
was
bella
his
depression
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
his
partner
who
after
first
advising
and
then
a
visit
to
a
specialist
for
diseases
of
the
heart
finally
recommended
more
work
and
put
a
generous
portion
of
his
own
on
to
the
young
man
desk
hardy
who
was
in
an
evil
temper
pitched
it
on
to
the
floor
and
with
a
few
incisive
remarks
on
levity
unbecoming
to
age
pursued
his
duties
in
gloomy
silence
a
short
time
afterwards
however
he
had
to
grapple
with
his
partner
work
in
real
earnest
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
genial
shipbroker
was
laid
up
with
a
rather
serious
illness
a
chill
caught
while
bathing
was
going
the
round
of
certain
unsuspected
weak
spots
and
the
patient
who
was
of
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
was
taking
a
greater
interest
in
medical
works
than
his
doctor
deemed
advisable
interesting
study
he
said
faintly
to
hardy
as
the
latter
sat
by
his
bedside
one
evening
and
tried
to
cheer
him
in
the
usual
way
by
telling
him
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
are
dozens
of
different
forms
of
liver
complaint
alone
and
i
got

much
said
his
visitor
with
the
confidence
of
youth
is
retorted
the
invalid
twice
its
proper
size
and
still
growing
base
of
the
left
lung
is
solidifying
or
i
much
mistaken
the
heart
instead
of
waltzing
as
is
suitable
to
my
time
of
life
is
doing
a
galop
and
everything
else
is
as
wrong
as
it
can
are
you
coming
back
inquired
the
other
repeated
swann
you
have
been
listening
i
a
wreck
all
through
violating
man
primeval
instinct
by
messing
about
in
cold
water
what
is
the
news
hardy
pondered
and
shook
his
head
is
going
to
be
married
in
july
he
said
at
last
better
have
had
that
trip
on
the
whaler
commented
swann
that
is
not
news
nathan
smith
told
it
me
this

repeated
the
other
in
surprise
done
him
a
little
service
said
the
invalid
him
out
of
a
mess
with
garth
and
co
he
been
here
two
or
three
times
and
i
must
confess
i
find
him
a
most
alluring
of
a
feather
began
hardy
superciliously
flatter
me
said
swann
putting
his
hand
out
of
the
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
am
not
worthy
to
sit
at
his
feet
he
is
the
most
amusing
knave
on
the
coast
he
is
like
a
sunbeam
in
a
sick
room
when
you
can
once
get
him
to
talk
of
his
experiences
have
you
seen
young
nugent
lately
does
he
seem
cheerful
but
he
is
not
was
the
reply
it
natural
for
the
young
to
marry
said
the
other
gravely
will
be
the
next
to
go
i
returned
hardy
with
affected
calmness
was
saying
something
about
it
this
morning
resumed
swann
regarding
him
from
lids
he
was
punching
and
tapping
me
all
about
the
ribs
while
he
was
talking
and
i
did
catch
all
he
said
but
i
think
it
all
arranged
murchison
is
there
nearly
every
day
i
understand
i
suppose
you
meet
him
there
hardy
whistling
softly
rose
and
walked
round
the
room
uncorking
medicine
bottles
and
sniffing
at
their
contents
a
smile
of
unaffected
pleasure
lit
up
his
features
as
he
removed
the
stopper
from
one
particularly
pungent
mixture
tablespoonfuls
three
times
a
day
he
read
slowly
did
you
have
the
last
swann
shall
i
ring
for
the
nurse
the
invalid
shook
his
head
impatiently
an
ungrateful
dog
he
muttered
you
would
tell
me
how
your
affair
is
going
have
you
got
any
chance
getting
now
said
hardy
calmly
better
right
go
then
responded
the
invalid
if
you
lose
that
girl
just
for
the
want
of
a
little
skilled
advice
from
an
expert
you
never
forgive
yourself
i
you
must
be
ill
then
said
the
younger
man
with
anxiety
said
swann
lying
on
his
back
and
apparently
addressing
the
ceiling
i
have
given
this
young
man
invaluable
assistance
and
each
time
he
has
hardy
laughed
and
the
nurse
returning
to
the
room
bade
him
and
departed
after
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
sick
room
the
air
was
delicious
and
he
walked
along
slowly
deep
in
thought
from
nathan
smith
his
thoughts
wandered
to
jack
nugent
and
his
unfortunate
engagement
and
from
that
to
kate
nugent
for
months
he
had
been
revolving
impossible
schemes
in
his
mind
to
earn
her
gratitude
and
possibly
that
of
the
captain
by
extricating
jack
in
the
latter
connection
he
was
also
reminded
of
that
unhappy
victim
of
unrequited
affection
edward
silk
it
was
early
to
go
indoors
and
the
house
was
dull
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
and
his
thoughts
reverting
to
his
sick
partner
smiled
as
he
remembered
remarks
which
that
irresponsible
person
had
made
at
various
times
concerning
the
making
of
his
last
will
and
testament
then
he
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
as
a
wild
kind
of
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
him
he
stood
for
some
time
thinking
then
walked
a
little
way
and
then
stopped
again
as
various
difficulties
presented
themselves
for
solution
finally
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
he
walked
back
in
some
excitement
to
the
house
he
had
quitted
over
half
an
hour
before
with
the
intention
of
speaking
to
the
invalid
concerning
a
duty
peculiarly
incumbent
upon
elderly
men
of
means
the
nurse
who
came
out
of
the
sick
room
gently
closing
the
door
after
her
demurred
a
little
to
this
second
visit
but
receiving
a
promise
from
the
visitor
not
to
excite
the
invalid
left
them
together
the
odour
of
the
abominable
physic
was
upon
the
air
said
the
invalid
have
been
thinking
that
i
was
rather
uncivil
a
little
while
ago
said
hardy
said
the
other
do
you
want
little
of
that
skilled
assistance
you
were
speaking
swann
made
an
alarming
noise
in
his
throat
hardy
sprang
forward
in
alarm
but
he
motioned
him
back
was
only
laughing
he
explained
hardy
repressed
his
annoyance
by
an
effort
and
endeavoured
but
with
scant
success
to
return
the
other
smile
on
said
the
shipbroker
presently
have
thought
of
a
scheme
for
upsetting
nugent
marriage
said
hardy
slowly
is
just
a
forlorn
hope
which
depends
for
its
success
on
you
and
nathan
a
friend
of
kybird
said
the
other
drily
is
the
most
important
thing
of
all
rejoined
hardy
is
next
to
your
shrewdness
and
tact
everything
depends
upon
you
really
and
whether
you
can
fool
smith
it
is
a
great
thing
in
our
favour
that
you
have
been
taking
him
up
you
coming
to
the
point
or
are
you
not
demanded
the
shipbroker
hardy
looked
cautiously
round
the
room
and
then
drawing
his
chair
close
to
the
bed
leaned
over
the
prostrate
man
and
spoke
rapidly
into
his
ear
cried
the
astounded
swann
suddenly
sitting
up
in
his
bed
you
scoundrel
to
be
done
said
hardy
ghoul
said
the
invalid
glaring
at
him
that
the
way
to
talk
to
a
sick
man
you
unscrupulous
rascal
be
amusement
for
you
pleaded
the
other
if
we
are
successful
it
will
be
the
best
thing
in
the
end
for
everybody
think
of
the
good
you
you
get
such
rascally
ideas
from
i
ca
think
mused
the
invalid
father
is
a
straightforward
honest
man
and
your
partner
uprightness
is
the
talk
of
does
take
much
to
make
sunwich
talk
retorted
hardy
preposterous
suggestion
to
make
to
a
man
of
my
standing
said
the
shipbroker
ignoring
the
remark
the
affair
ever
leaked
out
i
should
never
hear
the
end
of
ca
leak
out
said
hardy
if
it
does
there
is
no
direct
evidence
they
will
never
really
know
until
you
die
they
can
only
well
said
the
shipbroker
with
a
glance
to
get
rid
of
you
it
a
scheme
and
could
only
originate
with
a
young
man
whose
affections
have
weakened
his
head
i
said
hardy
and
patted
him
on
the
back
swann
referred
to
the
base
of
his
left
lung
and
he
apologized
have
to
fix
it
up
with
blaikie
said
the
invalid
lying
down
again
got
two
of
his
best
patients
last
week
so
that
it
ought
to
be
easy
and
besides
he
is
fond
of
innocent
awfully
obliged
to
you
said
hardy
might
be
as
well
if
we
pretended
to
quarrel
said
the
invalid
reflectively
as
you
are
known
to
be
a
friend
of
nugent
we
have
a
few
words
before
my
housekeeper
if
possible
to
insure
publicity
and
then
you
had
better
not
come
again
send
silk
instead
with
hardy
thanked
him
and
whispered
a
caution
as
a
footstep
was
heard
on
the
landing
the
door
opened
and
the
nurse
followed
by
the
housekeeper
bearing
a
tray
entered
the
room
i
ca
be
worried
about
these
things
said
swann
in
an
acrimonious
voice
as
they
entered
you
are
not
capable
of
settling
a
simple
question
like
that
yourself
ask
the
to
instruct
you
your
work
retorted
hardy
a
nice
mess
it
said
the
nurse
coming
forward
hastily
must
leave
the
room
sir
i
ca
have
you
exciting
my
hardy
bestowed
an
indignant
glance
at
the
invalid
out
said
that
gentleman
with
extraordinary
fierceness
for
one
in
his
weak
condition
future
nurse
i
wo
have
this
person
admitted
to
my
yes
certainly
said
the
nurse
must
go
sir
at
once
going
said
hardy
almost
losing
his
gravity
at
the
piteous
spectacle
afforded
by
the
as
she
stood
still
holding
the
tray
and
staring
at
the
combatants
you
tired
of
skulking
in
bed
perhaps
you
come
and
do
your
share
of
the
swann
rose
to
a
sitting
position
and
his
demeanour
was
so
alarming
that
the
nurse
hastening
over
to
him
entreated
him
to
lie
down
and
waved
hardy
peremptorily
from
the
room
said
the
invalid
with
great
relish
he
gazed
fixedly
at
the
young
man
as
he
departed
and
then
catching
sight
in
his
turn
of
the
housekeeper
perplexity
laid
himself
down
and
buried
his
face
in
the
the
nurse
crossed
over
to
her
assistant
and
taking
the
tray
from
her
told
her
in
a
sharp
whisper
that
if
she
ever
admitted
hardy
again
she
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
consequences
chapter

charmed
at
the
ease
with
which
he
had
demolished
the
objections
of
adolphus
swann
and
won
that
suffering
gentleman
over
to
his
plans
hardy
began
to
cast
longing
glances
at
equator
lodge
he
reminded
himself
that
the
labourer
was
worthy
of
his
hire
and
it
seemed
moreover
an
extremely
desirable
thing
that
captain
nugent
should
know
that
he
was
labouring
in
his
vineyard
with
the
full
expectation
of
a
bounteous
harvest
he
resolved
to
call
kate
nugent
who
heard
the
gate
swing
behind
him
as
he
entered
the
front
garden
looked
up
and
stood
spellbound
at
his
audacity
as
a
fairly
courageous
young
person
she
was
naturally
an
admirer
of
boldness
in
others
but
this
seemed
sheer
recklessness
moreover
it
was
recklessness
in
which
if
she
stayed
where
she
was
she
would
have
to
bear
a
part
or
be
guilty
of
rudeness
of
which
she
felt
incapable
she
took
a
third
course
and
raising
her
eyebrows
at
the
unnecessarily
loud
knocking
with
which
the
young
man
announced
his
arrival
retreated
in
good
order
into
the
garden
where
her
father
in
a
somewhat
heated
condition
was
laboriously
planting
geraniums
she
had
barely
reached
him
when
bella
in
a
state
of
fearsome
glee
came
down
the
garden
to
tell
the
captain
of
his
visitor
said
the
latter
sharply
as
he
straightened
his
aching
back
hardy
said
bella
impressively
showed
in
i
did
ask
to
take
a
chair
but
he
took
hardy
to
see
me
said
the
captain
to
his
daughter
after
bella
had
returned
to
the
house
dare
he
come
to
my
house
infernal
impudence
i
wo
see
i
go
in
and
see
him
for
you
inquired
kate
with
affected
artlessness
stay
where
you
are
miss
said
her
father
wo
have
him
speak
to
you
i
wo
have
him
look
at
you
i
he
beat
his
dirty
hands
together
and
strode
off
towards
the
house
jem
hardy
rose
from
his
chair
as
the
captain
entered
the
room
and
ignoring
a
look
of
black
inquiry
bade
him
do
you
want
asked
the
captain
gruffly
as
he
stared
him
straight
in
the
eye
came
to
see
you
about
your
son
marriage
said
the
other
you
still
desirous
of
preventing
it
sorry
you
had
the
trouble
said
the
captain
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
anger
now
may
i
ask
you
to
get
out
of
my
house
hardy
bowed
am
sorry
i
have
troubled
you
he
said
calmly
i
have
a
plan
which
i
think
would
get
your
son
out
of
this
affair
and
as
a
business
man
i
wanted
to
make
something
out
of
the
captain
eyed
him
scornfully
but
he
was
glad
to
see
this
successful
son
of
his
old
enemy
tainted
with
such
sordid
views
instead
of
turning
him
out
he
spoke
to
him
almost
fairly
much
do
you
want
he
inquired
things
considered
i
am
asking
a
good
deal
was
the
reply
much
repeated
the
captain
impatiently
hardy
hesitated
exchange
for
the
service
i
want
permission
to
visit
here
when
i
choose
he
said
at
length
twice
a
words
failed
the
captain
none
with
which
he
was
acquainted
seemed
forcible
enough
for
the
occasion
he
faced
his
visitor
stuttering
with
rage
and
pointed
to
the
door
out
of
my
house
he
roared
sorry
to
have
intruded
said
hardy
as
he
crossed
the
room
and
paused
at
the
door
is
none
of
my
business
of
course
i
thought
that
i
saw
an
opportunity
of
doing
your
son
a
good
turn
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
at
the
same
time
paying
off
old
scores
against
kybird
and
nathan
smith
i
thought
that
on
that
account
it
might
suit
you
good
he
walked
out
into
the
hall
and
reaching
the
front
door
fumbled
clumsily
with
the
catch
the
captain
watching
his
efforts
in
grim
silence
began
to
experience
the
twin
promptings
of
curiosity
and
temptation
is
this
wonderful
plan
of
yours
he
demanded
with
a
sneer
at
present
that
must
remain
a
secret
said
the
other
he
came
from
the
door
and
unbidden
followed
the
captain
into
the
room
again
do
you
want
to
visit
at
my
house
for
inquired
the
latter
in
a
forbidding
voice
see
your
daughter
said
hardy
the
captain
had
a
relapse
he
had
not
expected
a
truthful
answer
and
when
it
came
in
the
most
tone
it
found
him
quite
unprepared
his
first
idea
was
to
sacrifice
his
dignity
and
forcibly
eject
his
visitor
but
more
sensible
thoughts
prevailed
are
quite
sure
i
suppose
that
your
visits
would
be
agreeable
to
my
daughter
he
said
contemptuously
hardy
shook
his
head
should
come
ostensibly
to
see
you
he
said
cheerfully
smoke
a
pipe
with
stuttered
the
captain
explosively
a
pipe
with
me
not
said
the
other
am
offering
you
my
services
and
anything
that
is
worth
having
is
worth
paying
for
i
suppose
we
could
both
smoke
pipes
under
pleasanter
conditions
what
have
you
got
against
me
it
is
my
fault
that
you
and
my
father
have
do
want
anything
more
to
say
to
you
said
the
captain
sternly
shown
you
the
door
once
am
i
to
take
forcible
measures
hardy
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
am
sorry
he
said
moving
to
the
door
again
am
i
said
the
other
a
pity
said
hardy
regretfully
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
i
had
set
my
heart
on
fooling
kybird
and
smith
and
now
all
my
trouble
is
wasted
nathan
smith
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
the
captain
hesitated
his
visitor
seemed
to
be
confident
and
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
prevent
his
son
marriage
and
a
great
deal
to
repay
some
portion
of
his
debt
to
the
ingenious
smith
moreover
there
seemed
to
be
an
excellent
opportunity
of
punishing
the
presumption
of
his
visitor
by
taking
him
at
his
word
do
think
you
enjoy
your
smoking
here
much
he
said
curtly
take
my
chance
of
that
said
the
other
will
only
be
a
matter
of
a
few
weeks
and
then
if
i
am
unsuccessful
my
visits
if
you
successful
am
i
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
for
the
rest
of
my
life
demanded
the
captain
will
be
for
you
to
decide
was
the
reply
it
a
bargain
the
captain
looked
at
him
and
deliberated
right
mondays
and
thursdays
he
said
laconically
hardy
saw
through
the
ruse
and
countered
swann
is
ill
i
ca
always
get
away
when
i
wish
he
said
easily
just
drop
in
when
i
can
good
he
opened
the
door
and
fearful
lest
the
other
should
alter
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
walked
briskly
down
the
path
to
the
gate
the
captain
stood
for
some
time
after
his
departure
deep
in
thought
and
then
returned
to
the
garden
to
be
skilfully
catechized
by
miss
nugent
when
my
young
friend
comes
with
his
pipe
you
be
in
another
room
he
concluded
warningly
miss
nugent
looked
up
and
patted
his
cheek
tenderly
a
talent
for
organization
you
have
she
remarked
softly
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
the
idea
of
his
taking
such
a
fancy
to
you
the
captain
coughed
and
eyed
her
suspiciously
he
had
been
careful
not
to
tell
her
hardy
reasons
for
coming
but
he
had
a
shrewd
idea
that
his
caution
was
wasted
is
thursday
said
kate
slowly
will
be
here
and
saturday
what
shall
i
wear
the
captain
resumed
his
gardening
operations
by
no
means
perturbed
at
the
prophecy
much
as
he
disliked
the
young
man
he
gave
him
credit
for
a
certain
amount
of
decency
and
his
indignation
was
proportionately
great
the
following
evening
when
bella
announced
hardy
he
made
a
genial
remark
about
shylock
and
a
pound
of
flesh
but
finding
that
it
was
only
an
excellent
conversational
opening
the
subject
of
shakespeare
plays
lapsed
into
silence
it
was
an
absurd
situation
but
he
was
host
and
hardy
allowed
him
to
see
pretty
plainly
that
he
was
a
guest
he
answered
the
latter
remarks
with
a
very
ill
grace
and
took
covert
stock
of
him
as
one
of
a
species
he
had
not
encountered
before
one
result
of
his
was
that
he
was
spared
any
feeling
of
surprise
when
his
visitor
came
the
following
evening
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
said
miss
nugent
who
came
into
the
room
after
hardy
had
departed
do
know
him
as
well
as
i
said
her
father
sharply
mean
that
you
are
not
such
a
judge
of
character
as
i
am
said
kate
besides
i
have
made
a
special
study
of
young
men
the
only
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
why
you
should
have
such
an
extraordinary
fascination
for
talk
too
much
miss
said
the
captain
drawing
the
tobacco
jar
towards
him
and
slowly
filling
his
pipe
miss
nugent
sighed
and
after
striking
a
match
for
him
took
a
seat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
placed
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
can
quite
understand
him
liking
you
she
said
slowly
the
captain
grunted
if
he
is
like
other
sensible
people
continued
miss
nugent
in
a
coaxing
voice
more
he
sees
of
you
the
more
he
like
you
i
do
hope
he
has
not
come
to
take
you
away
from
the
indignant
captain
edged
her
off
the
side
of
his
chair
miss
nugent
quite
undisturbed
got
on
again
and
sat
tapping
the
floor
with
her
foot
her
arm
stole
round
his
neck
and
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
head
and
smiled
wickedly
is
he
she
said
in
a
careless
voice
do
know
anything
about
his
looks
growled
her
father
miss
nugent
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
surprise
thing
i
noticed
she
said
with
commendable
gravity
very
and
very
determined
what
are
you
going
to
give
him
if
he
gets
poor
jack
out
of
this
miserable
business
him
said
her
father
staring
met
jack
yesterday
said
kate
i
can
see
that
he
is
as
wretched
as
he
can
be
he
would
say
so
of
course
if
hardy
is
successful
you
ought
to
recognize
it
i
should
suggest
one
of
your
new
photos
in
an
eighteenpenny
she
slipped
off
the
chair
and
quitted
the
room
before
her
father
could
think
of
a
suitable
retort
and
he
sat
smoking
silently
until
the
entrance
of
kingdom
a
few
minutes
later
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
working
off
a
little
accumulated
gall
while
the
junior
partner
was
thus
trying
to
obtain
a
footing
at
equator
lodge
the
gravest
rumours
of
the
senior
partner
health
were
prevalent
in
the
town
nathan
smith
who
had
been
to
see
him
again
ostensibly
to
thank
him
for
his
efforts
on
his
behalf
was
of
opinion
that
he
was
breaking
up
and
in
conversation
with
kybird
shook
his
head
over
the
idea
that
there
would
soon
be
one
gentleman
the
less
in
a
world
which
was
none
too
full
of
them
all
got
to
go
some
day
observed
kybird
philosophically
that
cough
o
yours
getting
on
nat
smith
met
the
pleasantry
coldly
the
ailment
referred
to
was
one
of
some
standing
and
had
been
a
continual
source
of
expense
in
the
way
of
balsams
and
other
remedies
worried
about
money
he
said
referring
to
swann
we
that
worry
said
kybird
to
leave
it
to
continued
smith
a
bit
do
it
if
somebody
to
leave
it
to
would
so
much
to
leave
observed
kybird
sagely
a
rum
he
shook
his
head
over
it
and
went
on
with
the
uncongenial
task
of
marking
down
wares
which
had
suffered
by
being
exposed
outside
too
long
smith
who
always
took
an
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
friends
made
suggestions
should
put
a
ticket
marked
at
this
on
that
coat
he
said
severely
ought
to
be
looked
the
best
out
o
three
all
together
said
kybird
evenly
look
said
smith
what
an
place
you
put
this
ticket
why
not
put
it
higher
up
on
the
coat
the
ai
there
said
kybird
smith
apologized
and
watched
his
friend
without
further
criticism
ready
for
the
wedding
i
he
said
presently
kybird
assented
and
his
brow
darkened
as
he
spoke
of
surreptitious
raids
on
his
stores
made
by
kybird
and
daughter
idea
of
a
wedding
he
said
bitterly
to
dress
up
and
make
a
show
my
idea
is
a
few
real
good
old
pals
and
plenty
of
to
both
observed
nathan
smith
whose
knowledge
of
the
sex
was
pretty
accurate
kybird
nodded
gloomily
and
jack
do
seem
to
been
it
off
partikler
well
lately
he
said
slowly
getting
more
uppish
than
wot
was
when
come
here
first
but
i
got
to
promise
that
he
settle
any
money
that
might
ever
get
left
him
on
smith
inscrutable
eyes
glistened
into
something
as
nearly
approaching
a
twinkle
as
they
were
capable
settle
the
five
he
said
warmly
you
goin
to
send
nugent
an
invite
for
the
wedding
to
be
asked
o
course
said
kybird
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
rendered
necessary
by
a
certain
lightness
in
his
friend
manner
old
woman
do
like
the
nugent
lot
but
she
do
the
proper
course
she
will
said
smith
soothingly
over
and
a
drink
with
me
it
your
turn
to
chapter
xxi
gossip
from
one
or
two
quarters
which
reached
captain
nugent
ears
through
the
medium
of
his
sister
concerning
the
preparations
for
his
son
marriage
prevented
him
from
altering
his
mind
with
regard
to
the
visits
of
jem
hardy
and
showing
that
painstaking
young
man
the
door
indeed
the
nearness
of
the
approaching
nuptials
bade
fair
to
eclipse
for
the
time
being
all
other
grievances
and
when
hardy
paid
his
third
visit
he
made
a
determined
but
ineffectual
attempt
to
obtain
from
him
some
information
as
to
the
methods
by
which
he
hoped
to
attain
his
ends
his
failure
made
him
suspicious
and
he
hinted
pretty
plainly
that
he
had
no
guarantee
that
his
visitor
was
not
obtaining
admittance
under
false
pretences
i
not
getting
much
out
of
it
returned
hardy
frankly
wonder
you
come
said
his
hospitable
host
want
you
to
get
used
to
me
said
the
other
the
captain
started
and
eyed
him
uneasily
the
remark
seemed
fraught
with
hidden
meaning
then
he
inquired
raising
his
bushy
eyebrows
perhaps
i
can
come
the
captain
gave
him
up
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
crossing
his
legs
smoked
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
it
was
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
with
a
young
man
who
was
apparently
destitute
of
any
feelings
of
shame
or
embarrassment
he
bestowed
a
puzzled
glance
in
his
direction
and
saw
that
he
was
lolling
in
the
chair
with
an
appearance
of
the
greatest
ease
and
enjoyment
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
he
saw
that
he
was
gazing
with
much
satisfaction
at
a
photograph
of
miss
nugent
which
graced
the
mantelpiece
with
an
odd
sensation
the
captain
suddenly
identified
it
as
one
which
usually
stood
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
his
bedroom
and
he
wondered
darkly
whether
charity
or
mischief
was
responsible
for
its
appearance
there
in
any
case
it
disappeared
before
the
occasion
of
hardy
next
visit
and
the
visitor
sat
with
his
eyes
unoccupied
endeavouring
to
make
conversation
with
a
host
who
was
if
anything
more
discourteous
than
usual
it
was
uphill
work
but
he
persevered
and
in
fifteen
minutes
had
ranged
unchecked
from
north
pole
explorations
to
poultry
farming
it
was
a
relief
to
both
of
them
when
the
door
opened
and
bella
ushered
in
murchison
the
captain
received
the
new
arrival
with
marked
cordiality
and
giving
him
a
chair
near
his
own
observed
with
some
interest
the
curt
greeting
of
the
young
men
the
doctor
manner
indicated
polite
surprise
at
seeing
the
other
there
then
he
turned
to
the
captain
and
began
to
talk
to
him
for
some
time
they
chatted
without
interruption
and
the
captain
replies
when
hardy
at
last
made
an
attempt
to
make
the
conversation
general
enabled
the
doctor
to
see
without
much
difficulty
that
the
latter
was
an
unwelcome
guest
charmed
with
the
discovery
he
followed
his
host
lead
and
with
a
languid
air
replied
to
his
rival
in
monosyllables
the
captain
watched
with
quiet
satisfaction
and
at
each
rebuff
his
opinion
of
murchison
improved
it
was
gratifying
to
find
that
the
interloper
had
met
his
match
hardy
sat
patient
am
glad
to
have
met
you
tonight
he
said
after
a
long
pause
during
which
the
other
two
were
discussing
a
former
surgical
experience
of
the
captain
on
one
of
his
crew
said
murchison
are
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
said
the
doctor
again
said
the
other
nodding
been
very
busy
of
late
owing
to
my
partner
illness
and
you
are
attending
several
people
i
want
to
hear
said
murchison
with
a
towards
him
is
paul
inquired
hardy
replied
the
other
briefly
repeated
hardy
heavens
i
did
know
that
there
was
much
the
matter
with
was
no
hope
for
her
from
the
first
said
murchison
somewhat
sharply
was
merely
a
question
of
prolonging
her
life
a
little
while
she
lived
longer
than
i
deemed
possible
she
surprised
everybody
by
her
thing
said
hardy
is
joe
banks
said
murchison
again
biting
his
lip
and
eyeing
him
furiously
me
said
hardy
shaking
his
head
met
him
not
a
month
ago
he
was
on
his
way
to
see
you
poor
fellow
had
been
an
invalid
nearly
all
his
life
said
murchison
to
the
captain
casually
i
remember
him
was
the
reply
am
almost
afraid
to
ask
you
continued
hardy
shut
up
all
day
i
hear
so
little
how
is
old
miss
ritherdon
murchison
reddened
with
helpless
rage
captain
nugent
gazing
at
the
questioner
with
something
almost
approaching
respect
waited
breathlessly
for
the
invariable
answer
died
three
weeks
ago
i
surprised
that
you
have
not
heard
of
it
said
the
doctor
pointedly
course
she
was
old
said
hardy
with
the
air
of
one
advancing
extenuating
circumstances
old
replied
the
doctor
who
knew
that
the
other
was
now
at
the
end
of
his
obituary
list
there
any
other
of
my
patients
you
are
anxious
to
hear
about
thank
you
returned
hardy
with
some
haste
the
doctor
turned
to
his
host
again
but
the
charm
was
broken
his
talk
was
disconnected
owing
probably
to
the
fact
that
he
was
racking
his
brain
for
facts
relative
to
the
seamy
side
of
shipbroking
and
hardy
without
any
encouragement
whatever
was
interrupting
with
puerile
anecdotes
concerning
the
late
lamented
joe
banks
the
captain
came
to
the
rescue
ladies
are
in
the
garden
he
said
to
the
doctor
you
like
to
join
he
looked
coldly
over
at
hardy
as
he
spoke
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
their
eyes
met
and
the
young
man
was
on
his
feet
as
soon
as
his
rival
he
said
coolly
is
a
trifle
close
before
the
dismayed
captain
could
think
of
any
dignified
pretext
to
stay
him
he
was
out
of
the
room
the
doctor
followed
and
the
perturbed
captain
left
alone
stared
blankly
at
the
door
and
thought
of
his
daughter
words
concerning
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
he
was
a
proud
man
and
loth
to
show
discomfiture
so
that
it
was
not
until
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
that
he
followed
his
guests
to
the
garden
the
four
people
were
in
couples
the
paths
favouring
that
formation
although
the
doctor
to
the
detriment
of
the
border
had
made
two
or
three
determined
attempts
to
march
in
fours
with
a
feeling
akin
to
scorn
the
captain
saw
that
he
was
walking
with
kingdom
while
some
distance
in
the
rear
jem
hardy
followed
with
kate
he
stood
at
the
back
door
for
a
little
while
watching
hardy
upright
and
elate
was
listening
with
profound
attention
to
miss
nugent
the
doctor
sauntering
along
beside
kingdom
was
listening
with
a
languid
air
to
an
account
of
her
celebrated
escape
from
measles
some
years
before
as
a
professional
man
he
would
have
died
rather
than
have
owed
his
life
to
the
specific
she
advocated
kate
nugent
catching
sight
of
her
father
turned
and
as
he
came
slowly
towards
them
linked
her
arm
in
his
her
face
was
slightly
flushed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
was
just
coming
in
to
fetch
you
she
observed
is
so
pleasant
out
here
said
hardy
had
to
drop
behind
a
little
said
miss
nugent
raising
her
voice
and
murchison
will
talk
about
their
complaints
to
each
other
they
have
been
exchanging
the
captain
grunted
and
eyed
her
keenly
want
you
to
come
in
and
give
us
a
little
music
he
said
shortly
kate
nodded
is
your
favourite
music
hardy
she
inquired
with
a
smile
hardy
ca
stay
said
the
captain
in
a
voice
which
there
was
no
mistaking
hardy
pulled
out
his
watch
i
must
be
off
he
said
with
a
start
you
for
reminding
me
captain
am
glad
to
have
been
of
service
said
the
other
looking
his
grimmest
he
acknowledged
the
young
man
farewell
with
a
short
nod
and
forgetting
his
sudden
desire
for
music
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
with
his
daughter
have
you
been
saying
to
that
that
fellow
he
demanded
turning
to
her
suddenly
miss
nugent
reflected
said
it
was
a
fine
evening
she
replied
at
last
doubt
said
her
father
else
think
i
asked
him
whether
he
was
fond
of
gardening
said
miss
nugent
slowly
i
sure
i
had
no
business
to
speak
to
him
at
all
said
the
fuming
captain
do
quite
see
how
i
could
help
doing
so
said
his
daughter
surely
do
expect
me
to
be
rude
to
your
visitors
besides
i
feel
rather
sorry
for
repeated
the
captain
sharply
for
he
has
got
a
nice
kind
father
said
miss
nugent
squeezing
his
arm
affectionately
the
appearance
of
the
other
couple
at
the
head
of
the
path
saved
the
captain
the
necessity
of
a
retort
they
stood
in
a
little
knot
talking
but
miss
nugent
contrary
to
her
usual
habit
said
but
little
she
was
holding
her
father
arm
and
gazing
absently
at
the
dim
fields
stretching
away
beyond
the
garden
at
the
same
time
james
hardy
feeling
despite
his
bold
front
somewhat
badly
snubbed
was
sitting
on
the
beach
thinking
over
the
situation
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
company
of
kate
nugent
all
else
seemed
sordid
and
prosaic
his
own
conduct
in
his
attempt
to
save
her
brother
from
the
consequences
of
his
folly
most
sordid
of
all
he
wondered
gloomily
what
she
would
think
when
she
heard
of
it
he
rose
at
last
and
in
the
pale
light
of
the
new
moon
walked
slowly
along
towards
the
town
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
wanted
to
talk
about
kate
nugent
and
the
only
person
who
could
be
depended
upon
for
doing
that
was
samson
wilks
it
was
a
subject
of
the
steward
and
since
his
discovery
of
the
state
of
hardy
feelings
in
that
quarter
the
slightest
allusion
was
sufficient
to
let
loose
a
flood
of
reminiscences
it
was
dark
by
the
time
hardy
reached
the
alley
and
in
most
of
the
houses
the
lamps
were
lit
behind
drawn
blinds
the
steward
house
however
was
in
darkness
and
there
was
no
response
when
he
tapped
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
looked
in
a
dim
figure
rose
with
a
start
from
a
chair
hope
you
were
not
asleep
said
hardy
sir
said
the
steward
in
a
relieved
voice
thought
it
was
somebody
he
placed
a
chair
for
his
visitor
and
having
lit
the
lamp
slowly
lowered
the
blind
and
took
a
seat
opposite
been
sitting
in
the
dark
to
make
a
certain
party
think
i
was
out
he
said
slowly
keeps
making
a
excuse
about
teddy
to
come
over
and
see
me
last
night
talked
about
making
a
in
the
water
to
celebrate
kybird
wedding
and
she
came
over
and
sat
in
that
chair
and
cried
as
if
would
break
after
she
gone
teddy
comes
over
fierce
as
a
eagle
and
wants
to
know
wot
i
been
saying
to
mother
to
make
cry
between
the
two
of
i
a
nice
life
of
is
still
faithful
to
miss
kybird
then
said
hardy
with
a
sudden
sense
of
relief
said
wilks
ai
no
word
for
it
he
a
sticker
that
wot
is
and
it
my
misfortune
that
mother
takes
after
i
to
go
out
afore
breakfast
and
stay
out
till
late
at
night
and
even
then
like
as
not
she
catches
me
on
the
perhaps
she
will
make
a
hole
in
the
water
suggested
hardy
wilks
smiled
but
almost
instantly
became
grave
again
not
that
sort
he
said
bitterly
and
went
into
the
kitchen
to
draw
some
beer
he
drank
his
in
a
manner
which
betokened
that
the
occupation
afforded
him
no
enjoyment
and
full
of
his
own
troubles
was
in
no
mood
to
discuss
anything
else
he
gave
a
short
biography
of
mrs
silk
which
would
have
furnished
abundant
material
for
libel
actions
and
alluding
to
the
demise
of
the
late
mr
silk
spoke
of
it
as
though
it
were
the
supreme
act
of
artfulness
in
a
somewhat
adventurous
career
hardy
walked
home
with
a
mind
more
at
ease
than
it
had
been
at
any
time
since
his
overtures
to
swann
the
only
scruple
that
had
troubled
him
was
now
removed
and
in
place
of
it
he
felt
that
he
was
acting
the
part
of
a
guardian
angel
to
edward
silk
chapter
xxii
nathan
smith
usually
one
of
the
most
men
in
the
world
came
out
of
swann
house
in
a
condition
and
for
some
time
after
the
front
door
had
closed
behind
him
stood
gaping
on
the
narrow
pavement
he
looked
up
and
down
the
quiet
little
street
and
shook
his
head
sadly
it
was
a
street
of
staid
and
substantial
old
houses
houses
which
had
mellowed
and
blackened
with
age
but
whose
quaint
windows
and
doors
afforded
glimpses
of
comfort
attesting
to
the
prosperity
of
those
within
in
the
usual
way
nathan
smith
was
of
too
philosophical
a
temperament
to
experience
the
pangs
of
envy
but
these
things
affected
him
and
he
experienced
a
strange
feeling
of
discontent
with
his
lot
in
life
people
all
the
luck
he
muttered
and
walked
slowly
down
the
road
he
continued
his
reflections
as
he
walked
through
the
somewhat
squalid
streets
of
his
own
quarter
the
afternoon
was
wet
and
the
houses
looked
dingier
than
usual
dirty
inconvenient
little
places
most
of
them
with
a
few
cheap
gimcracks
making
a
brave
show
as
near
the
window
as
possible
smith
observed
them
with
newly
opened
eyes
and
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life
thought
of
the
and
struggles
of
the
poor
in
his
own
untidy
little
den
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
sat
for
some
time
deep
in
thought
over
the
events
of
the
afternoon
he
had
been
permitted
a
peep
at
wealth
at
wealth
too
which
was
changing
hands
but
was
not
coming
his
way
he
lit
his
pipe
and
producing
a
bottle
of
rum
from
a
cupboard
helped
himself
liberally
the
potent
fluid
softened
him
somewhat
and
a
intention
to
keep
the
news
from
kybird
melted
away
beneath
its
benign
influence
all
we
been
pals
for
pretty
near
thirty
years
said
smith
to
himself
he
took
another
draught
years
is
a
long
time
he
mused
he
finished
the
glass
if
do
give
me
something
out
of
it
i
do
as
much
as
i
can
he
continued
and
buttoning
up
his
coat
he
rose
and
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
high
street
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
sun
was
making
faint
efforts
to
break
through
watery
clouds
things
seemed
brighter
and
smith
heart
beat
in
response
he
was
going
to
play
the
part
of
a
benefactor
to
kybird
to
offer
him
access
at
any
rate
to
such
wealth
as
he
had
never
dreamed
of
he
paused
at
the
shop
window
and
observing
through
a
gap
in
the
merchandise
that
kybird
was
behind
the
counter
walked
in
and
saluted
him
got
news
for
you
he
said
slowly
said
kybird
with
indifference
news
repeated
smith
sinking
thoughtlessly
into
the
broken
and
slowly
extricating
himself
that
make
your
eyes
start
out
of
your
the
small
black
eyes
in
question
were
turned
shrewdly
in
his
direction
news
of
you
afore
nat
remarked
kybird
with
simple
severity
the
philanthropist
was
chilled
he
fixed
his
eyes
in
a
stony
stare
on
the
opposite
wall
kybird
who
had
ever
a
wholesome
dread
of
falling
a
victim
to
his
friend
cuteness
regarded
him
with
some
uncertainty
and
reminded
him
of
one
or
two
pieces
of
information
which
had
seriously
depleted
his
till
up
yet
for
the
wedding
inquired
smith
still
gazing
in
front
of
him
with
fathomless
eyes
be
put
up
next
week
said
kybird
said
his
friend
with
great
emphasis
well
d
mean
by
well
demanded
the
other
with
some
heat
was
thinking
replied
smith
mildly
it
all
for
the
best
and
i
better
my
tongue
true
love
is
better
than
money
after
all
it
ai
my
bisness
and
i
should
get
much
out
of
of
wot
nat
inquired
kybird
uneasily
smith
still
gazing
musingly
before
him
appeared
not
to
hear
the
question
after
the
rain
ai
it
he
said
slowly
all
right
said
the
other
shortly
smells
so
fresh
and
sweet
continued
his
friend
the
little
was
as
if
their
little
would
break
as
i
come
do
wonder
at
it
said
the
offended
kybird
the
banns
go
up
next
week
murmured
the
to
himself
you
got
anything
to
say
agin
it
demanded
kybird
not
replied
the
other
do
blame
me
when
it
too
late
that
kybird
staring
at
him
wrathfully
turned
this
dark
saying
over
in
his
mind
late
for
wot
he
inquired
said
nathan
smith
slowly
and
fresh
after
the
rain
ai
it
as
i
come
along
all
the
little
the
little
interrupted
kybird
with
sudden
violence
you
got
anything
to
say
why
do
you
say
it
like
a
man
the
parlour
door
opened
suddenly
before
the
other
could
reply
and
revealed
the
face
of
kybird
are
you
two
about
she
demanded
do
you
come
inside
and
sit
down
for
a
bit
smith
accepted
the
invitation
and
following
her
into
the
room
found
miss
kybird
busy
stitching
in
the
midst
of
a
bewildering
assortment
of
brown
paper
patterns
and
pieces
of
cloth
kybird
gave
him
a
chair
and
having
overheard
a
portion
of
his
conversation
with
her
husband
made
one
or
two
casual
inquiries
been
spending
a
hour
or
two
at
swann
said
smith
is
inquired
his
hostess
with
an
appearance
of
amiable
interest
the
shook
his
head
slipping
cable
he
said
slowly
been
making
will
and
i
was
one
o
the
something
in
smith
manner
as
he
uttered
this
simple
statement
made
his
listeners
anxious
to
hear
more
kybird
who
had
just
entered
the
room
and
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
holding
the
handle
regarded
him
expectantly
been
worrying
some
time
pursued
smith
got
nobody
belonging
to
and
for
a
long
time
could
think
to
leave
it
wot
with
property
and
other
things
it
a
matter
of
over
ten
thousand
said
kybird
who
felt
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
blaikie
was
the
other
witness
continued
smith
disregarding
the
interruption
swann
made
us
both
promise
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret
till
gone
but
out
o
friendship
to
you
i
thought
i
step
round
and
let
you
the
emphasis
on
the
words
was
unmistakable
kybird
dropped
her
work
and
sat
staring
at
him
while
her
husband
wriggled
with
excitement
ai
left
it
to
me
i
he
said
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
jocularity
a
brass
farden
replied
his
friend
cheerfully
to
none
of
you
why
should
ai
left
it
to
jack
i
said
miss
kybird
who
had
suspended
her
work
to
listen
my
dear
replied
the
made
will
all
and
proper
and
left
everything
all
that
property
and
other
things
amounting
to
over
ten
thousand
pounds
to
a
young
man
becos
was
jilt
crossed
in
love
a
few
months
ago
and
becos

a
good
and
faithful
servant

kybird
desperately
tell
me
that
been
and
left
all
that
money
to
young
teddy
i
wo
if
you
do
want
me
to
said
the
accommodating
smith
mind
it
a
dead
kybird
wiped
his
brow
and
red
patches
due
to
excitement
lent
a
little
variety
to
an
otherwise
commonplace
face
kybird
dazed
inquiry
are
we
to
fell
on
deaf
ears
while
miss
kybird
leaning
forward
with
lips
parted
fixed
her
eyes
intently
on
smith
face
a
pity
did
leave
it
to
young
nugent
said
that
gentleman
noting
with
much
pleasure
the
effect
of
his
announcement

young
teddy

quite
the

handkerchief
into
his
and

said
with
fierce
sarcasm

of

things
as

gets
married
got
to
a
few
words
with
behaved
very
bad
said
kybird
nodding
come
night
after
night
said
kybird
working
himself
up
into
a
fury
walked
out
with
my
gal
for
months
and
months
and
then
takes
off
as
if
we
was
good
enough
suppers

said
kybird
addressing
the
visitor
off
repeated
her
husband
off
as
if
we
was
dirt
beneath
feet
and
never
been
back
to
give
a
explanation
from
that
day
to
not
easy
surprised
said
kybird

i
must
say

a
surprise
to
me
if
anybody
told
me

behaved
like
that
i
would
ha
believed
it
i
could

faults

mine

breach
o
promise

for
five
thousand
pounds
said
kybird
with
decision
sense
said
nathan
smith
shortly
cried
kybird
my
gal
to
be
played
fast
and
loose
with
like
that
is
my
gal
to
be
pitched
over
when
likes
is
my
gal
the
good
o
talking
like
that
to
me
said
the
indignant
smith
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
get
married
to
teddy
at
once
afore
knows
of
when
that
be
inquired
his
friend
in
a
calmer
voice
time
said
the
shrugging
his
shoulders
old
gentleman
might
go
out
tonight
or
again
might
live
on
for
a
week
or
more
was
so
weak
could
sign
signed
it
all
right
said
kybird
starting
as
said
his
friend
why
not
wait
till
teddy
got
the
money
suggested
kybird
with
a
knowing
shake
of
her
head
said
smith
in
a
grating
voice
for
one
thing
be
a
rich
man
then
and
could
pick
teddy
silk
on
a
pound
or
thereabouts
a
week
and
teddy
silk
with
ten
thousand
pounds
be
two
different
people
besides
that
think
she
was
marrying
for
thought
that
said
kybird
firmly
never
forgive
advice
to
you
said
nathan
smith
shaking
his
forefinger
impressively
to
get
married
on
the
quiet
and
as
soon
as
possible
once
they
tied
up
teddy
ca
on
the
quiet
demanded
kybird
sharply
the
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
if
swann
got
to
of
it
he
guess
i
been
blabbing
for
one
thing
he
said
sharply
for
another
left
it
to
partly
to
make
up
for
disappointment
he
been
disappointed
in
younger
days
so
told
managed
to
get
enough
strength
to
alter
will
kybird
shivered
takes
time
to
get
married
though
he
objected
said
smith
ironically
does
get
round
young
teddy
and
then
put
the
banns
up
take
your
time
about
it
and
be
sure
and
let
swann
know
d
think
would
understand
wot
it
meant
and
spoil
it
to
say
nothing
of
teddy
seeing
through
it
wot
to
be
done
then
inquired
the
staring
kybird
up
to
london
and
married
by
special
license
said
smith
speaking
rapidly
if
possible
if
not
the
day
after
go
and
pitch
a
tale
to
teddy
tonight
and
make
understand
it
to
be
done
on
the
strict
licenses
cost
money
said
kybird
it
a
matter
o
thirty
pounds
or
nathan
smith
rose
and
his
eyes
were
almost
expressive
he
nodded
to
the
ladies
and
crossed
to
the
door
kybird
suddenly
seized
him
by
the
coat
and
held
him
be
in
a
nat
she
pleaded
ai
all
as
clever
as
you
about
looking
a
in
the
mouth
began
the
indignant
smith
down
urged
kybird
ca
expect
us
to
be
as
quick
in
seeing
things
as
wot
you
he
pushed
his
partly
mollified
friend
into
his
chair
again
and
taking
a
seat
next
him
began
to
view
the
affair
with
enthusiasm
shall
turn
young
nugent
off
tonight
he
said
firmly
right
said
the
other
and
do
a
few
more
silly
things
like
that
and
we
shall
be
if
you
got
a
instead
of
wot
you
got
you
would
talk
of
giving
the
show
away
like
that
nobody
must
know
or
guess
about
anything
until
young
teddy
is
married
to
and
got
the
seems
something
like
deceitfulness
said
miss
kybird
who
had
been
listening
to
the
plans
for
her
future
with
admirable
composure
for
teddy
own
sake
said
nathan
smith
knows
half
crazy
after
do
know
that
i
do
like
best
even
without
the
money
said
miss
kybird
calmly
could
been
more
attentive
than
i
believe
that
marry
me
if
a
hundred
thousand
but
it
looks
better
your
all
round
said
nathan
smith
with
at
approving
nod
round
to
teddy
and
whistle
back
and
mind
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret
on
account
o
trouble
with
young
nugent
d
twig
the
admiring
kybird
said
that
he
was
a
wonder
and
in
the
discussion
on
ways
and
means
which
followed
sat
listening
with
growing
respect
to
the
managing
abilities
both
of
his
friend
and
his
wife
difficulties
were
only
mentioned
for
the
purpose
of
being
satisfactorily
solved
and
he
noticed
with
keen
appreciation
that
the
prospect
of
a
ten
thousand
pound
was
already
adding
to
that
lady
dignity
she
sniffed
haughtily
as
she
spoke
of
nugent
and
the
manner
in
which
she
promised
smith
that
he
should
not
lose
by
his
services
would
have
graced
a
duchess
did
expect
to
lose
by
it
said
the
pointedly
over
and
a
glass
at
the
chequers
dan
and
then
you
can
go
along
and
see
chapter
xxiii
the
summer
evening
was
well
advanced
when
kybird
and
his
old
friend
parted
the
former
gentleman
was
in
almost
a
sentimental
mood
and
the
satisfied
that
his
pupil
was
in
a
particularly
appropriate
frame
of
mind
for
the
object
of
his
visit
renewed
his
instructions
about
binding
mr
silk
to
secrecy
and
departed
on
business
of
his
own
kybird
walked
slowly
towards
fullalove
alley
with
his
head
sunk
in
meditation
he
was
anxious
to
find
mr
silk
alone
as
otherwise
the
difficulty
of
his
errand
would
be
considerably
increased
mrs
silk
intelligence
being
by
no
means
obscured
by
any
ungovernable
affection
for
the
kybird
family
if
she
was
at
home
he
would
have
to
invent
some
pretext
for
luring
teddy
into
the
privacy
of
the
open
air
the
lamp
was
lit
in
the
front
room
by
the
time
he
reached
the
house
and
the
shadows
of
geraniums
which
had
won
through
several
winters
formed
a
straggling
pattern
on
the
holland
blind
kybird
first
making
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
peep
round
the
edges
of
this
decoration
tapped
gently
on
the
door
and
in
response
to
a
command
to
in
turned
the
handle
and
looked
into
the
room
to
his
relief
he
saw
that
mr
silk
was
alone
evening
teddy
he
said
with
a
genial
smile
as
he
entered
slowly
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
i
see
you
well
quite
well
returned
mr
silk
gazing
at
him
with
unconcealed
surprise
glad
to
it
said
kybird
in
a
somewhat
reproachful
voice
your
sake
for
sake
though
i
did
expect
to
find
you
looking
a
little
bit
down
ah
it
the
wimmen
that
the
after
mr
silk
coughed
d
mean
he
inquired
somewhat
puzzled
came
to
see
you
teddy
on
a
very
delikit
business
said
kybird
taking
a
seat
and
gazing
diffidently
at
his
hat
as
he
swung
it
between
his
hands
as
man
to
man
i
doing
of
my
dooty
but
if
you
do
want
to
wot
i
got
to
say
say
so
and
kybird
darken
your
door
no
can
i
know
whether
i
want
to
it
or
not
when
i
do
know
wot
it
is
said
mr
silk
judiciously
kybird
sat
biting
his
then
he
looked
up
suddenly
he
said
with
an
outburst
of
desperate
frankness
is
crying
eyes
mr
silk
with
a
smothered
exclamation
started
up
from
his
chair
and
regarded
him
eagerly
she
knew
i
been
pursued
kybird
i
do
know
wot
she
would
do
that
pride
but
i
got
my
pride
too
the
pride
of
a
father
what
she
crying
about
inquired
mr
silk
in
an
unsteady
voice
been
looking
poorly
for
some
time
continued
the
veracious
kybird
crying
when
i
tell
you
that
part
o
the
wot
she
was
making
to
be
taken
away
from
because
o
the
tears
she
dropped
on
it
you
may
some
idea
of
wot
things
are
like
she
never
forgot
you
teddy
and
it
was
your
quick
temper
that
day
that
made
take
on
with
young
nugent
she
got
a
temper
too
but
she
give
love
once
and
being
my
daughter
she
could
give
it
he
stole
a
glance
at
his
listener
mr
silk
very
pale
and
upright
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
shaking
all
over
with
nervous
excitement
twice
he
tried
to
speak
and
failed
it
is
teddy
sighed
kybird
rising
as
though
to
depart
done
my
dooty
it
was
a
thing
to
do
but
i
done
you
mean
said
mr
silk
recovering
his
voice
at
last
you
mean
that
amelia
would
marry
me
after
all
i
mean
repeated
kybird
naturally
indignant
that
his
very
plain
speaking
should
be
deemed
capable
of
any
misconstruction
i
speaking
to
a
stock
or
a
stone
teddy
mr
silk
took
a
deep
breath
and
buttoned
up
his
coat
as
though
preparing
to
meet
nugent
there
and
then
in
deadly
encounter
for
the
person
of
miss
kybird
the
colour
was
back
in
his
cheeks
by
this
time
and
his
eyes
were
unusually
bright
he
took
a
step
towards
kybird
and
pressing
his
hand
warmly
pushed
him
back
into
his
seat
again
pride
to
consider
teddy
said
the
latter
gentleman
with
the
whisper
of
a
conspirator
ca
stand
being
talked
about
all
over
the
town
and
pointed
me
see
anybody
at
said
the
truculent
mr
silk
me
see
that
the
way
to
talk
teddy
said
kybird
gazing
at
him
with
admiration
said
the
heroic
mr
silk
do
more
than
he
clenched
his
fists
and
paced
boldly
up
and
down
the
hearthrug
leave
things
to
me
said
kybird
with
a
confidential
wink
see
that
it
all
right
all
i
ask
of
you
is
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret
even
your
mother
must
be
as
secret
as
the
grave
said
the
overjoyed
mr
silk
lots
o
things
to
be
taken
into
consideration
said
kybird
truthfully
might
be
as
well
for
you
to
be
married
said
the
astonished
mr
silk
got
the
nerve
to
send
young
nugent
about
business
explained
kybird
feels
sorry
for
pore
fellow
but
got
a
loving
and
affectionate
and
she
ca
bear
making
love
to
you
can
understand
what
it
is
ca
you
can
imagine
it
said
mr
silk
gloomily
and
he
flushed
crimson
as
the
possibilities
suggested
by
the
remark
occurred
to
him
been
thinking
it
over
for
some
time
resumed
kybird
it
and
turning
it
all
ways
and
the
only
thing
i
can
see
for
it
is
for
you
to
be
married
on
the
strict
of
course
if
you
do
like
repeated
the
transported
mr
silk
go
and
be
married
now
if
you
kybird
shook
his
head
at
such
haste
and
then
softening
a
little
observed
that
it
did
him
credit
he
proceeded
to
improve
the
occasion
by
anecdotes
of
his
own
courting
some
thirty
years
before
and
was
in
the
middle
of
a
thrilling
account
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
bearded
the
whole
of
his
future
wife
family
when
a
quick
step
outside
which
paused
at
the
door
brought
him
to
a
sudden
halt
announced
mr
silk
in
a
whisper
kybird
nodded
and
the
heroic
appearance
of
visage
which
had
accompanied
his
tale
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
some
uneasiness
he
coughed
behind
his
hand
and
sat
gazing
before
him
as
mrs
silk
entered
the
room
and
gave
vent
to
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
as
she
saw
the
visitor
she
gazed
sharply
from
him
to
her
son
kybird
expression
was
now
normal
but
despite
his
utmost
efforts
mr
silk
could
not
entirely
banish
the
smile
which
trembled
on
his
lips
and
teddy
said
kybird
turning
to
her
with
a
little
bob
which
served
him
for
a
bow
just
been
having
a
little
talk
about
old
was
just
passing
said
mr
silk
passing
and
thought
i
look
in
said
kybird
with
a
careless
little
laugh
door
was
open
a
open
corroborated
mr
silk
i
just
came
in
to
say
ow
d
do
said
kybird
mrs
silk
sharp
white
face
turned
from
one
to
the
other
you
said
it
she
inquired
blandly
said
kybird
restraining
mr
silk
evident
intention
of
hot
speech
by
a
warning
glance
now
i
just
toddle
off
go
a
bit
o
the
way
with
you
said
edward
silk
feel
as
if
a
bit
of
a
walk
would
do
me
left
alone
the
astonished
mrs
silk
took
the
visitor
vacated
chair
and
with
wrinkled
brow
sat
putting
two
and
two
together
until
the
sum
got
beyond
her
powers
of
calculation
kybird
affability
and
teddy
cheerfulness
were
alike
incomprehensible
she
mended
a
hole
in
her
pocket
and
darned
a
pair
of
socks
and
at
last
anxious
for
advice
or
at
least
a
confidant
resolved
to
see
wilks
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
across
the
alley
and
saw
with
some
satisfaction
that
his
blind
was
illuminated
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
sharply
and
then
stood
gasping
on
the
doorstep
so
simultaneous
were
the
two
happenings
that
it
actually
appeared
as
though
the
closing
of
the
door
had
blown
wilks
lamp
out
it
was
a
night
of
surprises
but
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
stepped
over
and
tried
his
door
it
was
fast
and
there
was
no
answer
to
her
knuckling
she
knocked
louder
and
listened
a
door
slammed
violently
at
the
back
of
the
house
a
distant
clatter
of
what
sounded
like
saucepans
came
from
beyond
and
above
it
all
a
tremulous
but
harsh
voice
bellowed
industriously
through
an
interminable
chant
by
the
time
the
third
verse
was
reached
wilks
neighbours
on
both
sides
were
beating
madly
upon
their
walls
and
threats
strained
through
the
plaster
she
stayed
no
longer
but
regaining
her
own
door
sat
down
again
to
await
the
return
of
her
son
mr
silk
was
long
in
coming
and
she
tried
in
vain
to
occupy
herself
with
various
small
jobs
as
she
speculated
in
vain
on
the
meaning
of
the
events
of
the
night
she
got
up
and
stood
by
the
open
door
and
as
she
waited
the
clock
in
the
which
rose
over
the
roofs
hard
by
slowly
boomed
out
the
hour
of
eleven
as
the
echoes
of
the
last
stroke
died
away
the
figure
of
mr
silk
turned
into
the
alley
must
quite
a
nice
walk
said
his
mother
as
she
drew
back
into
the
room
and
noted
the
brightness
of
his
eye
was
the
reply
been
and
asked
you
to
the
wedding
said
the
sarcastic
mrs
silk
her
son
started
and
turning
his
back
on
her
wound
up
the
clock
has
he
said
with
a
sly
grin
mrs
silk
eyes
snapped
of
all
the
impudence
she
said
breathlessly
has
said
her
son
hugging
himself
over
the
joke
what
more
i
he
composed
his
face
sufficiently
to
bid
her
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
her
remonstrances
and
inquiries
took
up
a
candle
and
went
off
whistling
chapter
xxiv
the
idea
in
the
mind
of
james
hardy
when
he
concocted
his
infamous
plot
was
that
jack
nugent
would
be
summarily
dismissed
on
some
pretext
by
miss
kybird
and
that
steps
would
at
once
be
taken
by
her
family
to
publish
her
banns
together
with
those
of
mr
silk
in
thinking
thus
he
had
made
no
allowance
for
the
workings
and
fears
of
such
a
capable
mind
as
nathan
smith
and
as
days
passed
and
nothing
happened
he
became
a
prey
to
despair
he
watched
mr
silk
keenly
but
that
gentleman
went
about
his
work
in
his
usual
quiet
and
gloomy
fashion
and
after
a
day
leave
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
the
affairs
of
a
sick
aunt
in
camberwell
came
back
only
a
little
less
gloomy
than
before
it
was
also
clear
that
swann
complaisance
was
nearly
at
an
end
and
a
letter
couched
in
vigorous
not
to
say
regrettable
terms
for
a
moribund
man
expressed
such
a
desire
for
fresh
air
and
exercise
that
hardy
was
prepared
to
see
him
at
any
moment
it
was
the
more
unfortunate
as
he
thought
that
he
had
of
late
detected
a
slight
softening
in
captain
nugent
manner
towards
him
on
two
occasions
the
captain
who
was
out
when
he
called
had
made
no
comment
to
find
upon
his
return
that
the
visitor
was
being
entertained
by
his
daughter
going
so
far
indeed
as
to
permit
the
conversation
to
gain
vastly
in
interest
by
that
young
person
remaining
in
the
room
in
face
of
this
improvement
he
thought
with
dismay
of
having
to
confess
failure
in
a
scheme
which
apart
from
success
was
inexcusable
the
captain
had
also
unbent
in
another
direction
and
wilks
to
his
great
satisfaction
was
allowed
to
renew
his
visits
to
equator
lodge
and
assist
his
old
master
in
the
garden
here
at
least
the
steward
was
safe
from
the
designs
of
mrs
silk
and
the
innuendoes
of
fullalove
alley
it
was
at
this
time
too
that
the
widow
stood
in
most
need
of
his
advice
the
behaviour
of
edward
silk
being
of
a
nature
to
cause
misgivings
in
any
mother
heart
a
strange
restlessness
possessed
him
varied
with
occasional
outbursts
of
hilarity
and
good
nature
dark
hints
emanated
from
him
at
these
times
concerning
a
surprise
in
store
for
her
at
no
distant
date
hints
which
were
at
once
explained
away
in
a
most
unsatisfactory
manner
when
she
became
too
pressing
in
her
inquiries
he
haunted
the
high
street
and
when
the
suspicious
mrs
silk
spoke
of
amelia
he
only
laughed
and
waxed
humorous
over
such
unlikely
subjects
as
broken
hearts
and
broken
vows
it
was
a
week
after
kybird
visit
to
the
alley
that
he
went
as
usual
for
a
stroll
up
and
down
the
high
street
the
evening
was
deepening
and
some
of
the
shops
had
already
lit
up
as
mr
silk
with
his
face
against
the
tried
in
vain
to
penetrate
the
obscurity
of
kybird
shop
he
could
just
make
out
a
dim
figure
behind
the
counter
which
he
believed
to
be
amelia
when
a
match
was
struck
and
a
gas
jet
threw
a
sudden
light
in
the
shop
and
revealed
jack
nugent
standing
behind
the
counter
with
his
hand
on
the
lady
shoulder
one
glance
was
sufficient
the
next
moment
there
was
a
sharp
cry
from
miss
kybird
and
a
bewildered
stare
from
nugent
as
something
only
comparable
to
a
human
cracker
bounced
into
the
shop
and
commenced
to
explode
before
them
your
off
raved
mr
silk
alone
dare
you
d
hear
me
i
wo

i
wo

remonstrated
nugent
following
up
miss
kybird
as
she
edged
away
from
him
alone
d
yelled
mr
silk
thumping
the
counter
with
his
small
fist
my
wife
mad
said
nugent
calmly
staring
raving
mad
poor
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
had
just
begun
to
recommend
a
few
remedies
when
the
parlour
door
opened
and
the
figure
of
kybird
with
his
wife
standing
close
behind
him
appeared
in
the
doorway
making
all
this
noise
demanded
the
former
looking
from
one
to
the
other
am
said
mr
silk
fiercely
no
use
your
winking
at
me

going
to
any
more
of
this
nonsense

and
get
your
on
and

straight
off
with

gave
a
warning
cough
easy
teddy
he
murmured

me
said
the
irritated
mr
silk
it
wo
do
no
kybird
subsided
he
was
not
going
to
quarrel
with
a
who
might
at
any
moment
be
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
he
mad
inquired
the
amazed
nugent
not
replied
kybird
moving
aside
to
let
his
daughter
pass
madder
than
you
are
wot
d
mean
mad
nugent
looked
round
in
perplexity
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
teddy
and
amelia

he
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
eagerness
do
said
kybird
seems
they
been
fond
of
one
another
all
along
and
they
went
up
all
unbeknown
last
friday
and
got
a
license
and
got
if

see

putting
your
on

mr
silk
with
alarming
vagueness

the
delighted
nugent
with
much
gravity
we
do
want

in
the
irate
kybird
pushing
her
way
past
her
husband
and
confronting
the
speaker

deceived
said
nugent
in
a
thrilling
voice
all

a
lot
of
trouble
teddy
i
would

my
heart
is
we
do
want

the
aggressive
kybird

take
yourself
off
as
soon
as
ever
you
like
you
ca
be
too
quick
to
please
nugent
bowed
and
walked
past
the
counter
not
even
a
bit
of
for
me
he
said
shaking
a
reproachful
head
at
the
heated
mr
silk
i
put
you
down
first
on
my
he
paused
at
the
door
and
after
a
brief
intimation
that
he
would
send
for
his
effects
on
the
following
day
provided
that
his
broken
heart
had
not
proved
fatal
in
the
meantime
waved
his
hand
to
the
company
and
departed
kybird
followed
him
to
the
door
as
though
to
see
him
off
the
premises
and
gazing
after
the
receding
figure
swelled
with
indignation
as
he
noticed
that
he
favoured
a
mode
of
progression
which
was
something
between
a
walk
and
a
hornpipe
nugent
had
not
been
in
such
spirits
since
his
return
to
sunwich
and
hardly
able
to
believe
in
his
good
fortune
he
walked
on
in
a
state
of
growing
excitement
until
he
was
clear
of
the
town
then
he
stopped
to
consider
his
next
move
and
after
a
little
deliberation
resolved
to
pay
a
visit
to
jem
hardy
and
acquaint
him
with
the
joyful
tidings
that
gentleman
however
was
out
and
nugent
somewhat
irritated
at
such
thoughtlessness
stood
in
the
road
wondering
where
to
go
next
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
him
to
sleep
that
night
without
telling
the
good
news
to
somebody
and
after
some
thought
he
selected
wilks
it
was
true
that
relations
had
been
somewhat
strained
between
them
since
the
latter
attempt
at
crimping
him
but
he
was
never
one
to
bear
malice
and
tonight
he
was
full
of
the
kindliest
thoughts
to
all
mankind
he
burst
into
wilks
front
room
suddenly
and
then
pulled
up
short
the
steward
with
a
pitiable
look
of
anxiety
on
his
pallid
features
was
leaning
awkwardly
against
the
mantelpiece
and
opposite
him
mrs
silk
sat
in
an
dissolved
in
tears
sam
inquired
nugent
who
had
heard
of
the
steward
difficulties
from
hardy
sir
said
wilks
hastily
down
he
pushed
forward
a
chair
and
almost
pulling
his
visitor
into
it
stood
over
him
attentively
and
took
his
hat
you
quite
sure
i
not
interrupting
you
inquired
the
thoughtful
nugent
sure
sir
said
wilks
eagerly
was
just
a
bit
of
a
chat
with
my
neighbour
mrs
silk
that
the
lady
in
question
removed
her
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
him
with
reproachful
tenderness
wilks
plunged
hastily
into
conversation
came
over
to
tell
me
a
bit
o
news
he
said
eyeing
the
young
man
doubtfully
seems
that
teddy
nugent
fetched
a
mighty
sigh
and
shook
his
head
mrs
silk
gazed
at
him
earnestly
is
full
of
surprises
sir
she
remarked
sadness
added
nugent
hope
that
they
will
be
struck
me
all
of
a
said
mrs
silk
rolling
her
handkerchief
into
a
ball
and
placing
it
in
her
lap
was
doing
a
bit
of
ironing
when
in
walks
teddy
with
amelia
kybird
and
says
they
was
married
last
friday
i
was
that
shaken
i
did
know
what
i
did
or
what
i
said
then
i
came
over
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
thought
wilks
ought
to
know
about
wilks
cleared
his
throat
and
turned
an
agonized
eye
on
nugent
he
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
why
mrs
silk
should
think
it
necessary
to
inform
him
but
the
fear
of
precipitating
a
crisis
stayed
his
tongue
i
to
do
i
do
know
continued
mrs
silk
feebly
ca
two
queens
in
one
so
to
she
was
walking
out
with
teddy
long
ago
urged
wilks
no
worse
now
than
i
would
be
married
by
license
said
mrs
silk
deftly
ignoring
the
remark
i
ca
be
asked
in
church
in
the
proper
way
i
wo
be
married
at
right
said
nugent
something
so
sudden
about
a
license
he
added
with
feeling
and
wilks
was
talking
about
marriage
only
the
other
day
pursued
mrs
silk
with
a
bashfulness
which
set
every
nerve
in
the
steward
body
quivering
we
both
agreed
that
banns
was
the
proper
way
was
talking
about
it
corrected
wilks
in
a
hoarse
voice
brought
up
the
subject
and
i
agreed
with
you
not
that
it
matters
to
me
people
get
married
that
their
affair
banns
or
license
it
all
one
to
wo
be
married
by
license
said
mrs
silk
with
sudden
petulance
i
rather
not
be
she
added
softening
wilks
took
his
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
blew
his
nose
violently
mrs
silk
methods
of
attack
left
him
little
opportunity
for
the
plain
speaking
which
was
necessary
to
dispel
illusions
he
turned
a
watery
appealing
eye
on
to
nugent
and
saw
to
his
surprise
that
that
gentleman
was
winking
at
him
with
great
significance
and
persistence
it
would
have
needed
a
heart
of
stone
to
have
been
unaffected
by
such
misery
and
tonight
nugent
thankful
for
his
own
escape
was
in
a
singularly
merciful
mood
this
sounds
as
though
you
are
going
to
be
married
he
said
turning
to
mrs
silk
with
a
polite
smile
the
widow
simpered
and
looked
down
thereby
affording
nugent
an
opportunity
of
another
signal
to
the
perturbed
steward
who
sat
with
such
a
look
of
anxiety
on
his
face
lest
he
should
miss
his
cue
that
the
young
man
composure
was
tried
to
the
utmost
been
a
understood
thing
for
a
long
time
she
said
slowly
i
could
leave
my
son
while
was
single
and
nobody
to
look
after
a
good
mother
makes
a
good
wife
so
they
say
a
woman
ca
always
own
way
in
everything
and
if
it
not
to
be
by
banns
then
by
license
it
must
be
i
he
be
a
fortunate
man
whoever
he
is
said
nugent
with
another
warning
glance
at
wilks
i
only
hope
that
he
make
a
better
husband
than
you
do
sam
he
added
in
a
low
but
severe
voice
mrs
silk
gave
a
violent
start
husband
than
does
she
cried
sharply
wilks
ai
nugent
baseless
charge
took
the
steward
all
aback
he
stiffened
in
his
chair
a
picture
of
consternation
and
guilt
appeared
stamped
on
every
feature
but
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
look
to
nugent
eye
for
guidance
and
sufficient
strength
of
character
to
accept
this
last
bid
for
liberty
my
business
sir
he
quavered
in
offended
tones
you
ai
married
screamed
mrs
silk
mind
said
nugent
pacifically
i
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
it
it
a
sore
subject
with
sam
and
i
daresay
there
were
faults
on
both
sides
were
there
sam
sir
said
wilks
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
hard
to
make
distinct
you
never
told
me
you
were
married
said
mrs
silk
breathlessly
never
said
i
was
retorted
the
culprit
defiantly
people
liked
to
think
i
was
a
single
man
i
do
care
it
got
nothing
to
do
with
them
besides
she
lives
at
stepney
and
i
do
from
once
in
six
months
she
do
interfere
with
me
and
i
do
interfere
with
mrs
silk
got
up
from
her
chair
and
stood
confronting
him
with
her
hand
grasping
the
back
of
it
her
cold
eyes
gleamed
and
her
face
worked
with
spite
as
she
tried
in
vain
to
catch
his
eye
of
nugent
and
his
ingenuous
surprise
at
her
behaviour
she
took
no
notice
at
all
a
deceiver
she
gasped
been
behaving
like
a
single
man
and
everybody
thought
you
was
a
single
hope
you
have
been
paying
attentions
to
anybody
sam
said
nugent
in
a
shocked
voice
said
mrs
silk
shivering
with
anger
the
deceiving
villain
ask
anybody
and
see
what
they
tell
you
oh
you
wicked
man
i
wonder
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
truth
to
tell
wilks
was
looking
in
any
direction
but
hers
his
eyes
met
nugent
but
there
was
a
look
of
such
stern
disdain
on
that
gentleman
face
that
he
was
fain
to
look
away
again
it
a
friend
of
yours
inquired
the
artless
nugent
mind
said
mrs
silk
recovering
herself
mind
who
it
was
you
wait
till
i
go
and
tell
teddy
she
continued
turning
to
the
trembling
wilks
got
the
of
a
man
in
you
with
this
dire
threat
and
turning
occasionally
to
bestow
another
fierce
glance
upon
the
steward
she
walked
to
the
door
and
opening
it
to
its
full
extent
closed
it
behind
her
with
a
crash
and
darted
across
the
alley
to
her
own
house
the
two
men
gazed
at
each
other
without
speaking
and
then
wilks
stepping
over
to
the
door
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
not
afraid
of
teddy
said
the
staring
nugent
said
wilks
snapping
his
huge
fingers
not
afraid
o
fifty
teddies
but
she
might
come
back
with
if
it
ha
been
for
you
sir
i
do
know
wot
would
and
draw
some
beer
and
get
me

clean
pipe
said
nugent
dropping
into
a
chair
both
been
mercifully
preserved
sam
and
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
drink
to
our
noble
selves
and
be
more
careful
for
the
wilks
obeyed
and
again
thanking
him
warmly
for
his
invaluable
services
sat
down
to
compile
a
few
facts
about
his
newly
acquired
wife
warranted
to
stand
the
severest
which
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
them
a
task
interspersed
with
malicious
reminiscences
of
mrs
silk
attacks
on
his
liberty
he
also
insisted
on
giving
up
his
bed
to
nugent
for
the
night
suppose
he
said
later
on
as
nugent
after
a
faint
objection
or
two
took
his
candle
suppose
this
yarn
about
my
being
married
will
get
about
suppose
so
said
nugent
yawning
as
he
paused
with
his
foot
on
the
stair
about
it
said
wilks
in
a
somewhat
dissatisfied
voice
about
it
repeated
nugent
sternly
sir
said
wilks
with
an
insufferable
simper
only
it
make
things
a
little
bit
slow
for
me
that
nugent
eyed
him
for
a
space
in
speechless
amazement
and
then
with
a
few
strong
remarks
on
ingratitude
and
senile
vanity
mounted
the
winding
little
stairs
and
went
to
bed
chapter
xxv
the
day
after
mr
silk
sudden
and
unexpected
assertion
of
his
marital
rights
kybird
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
shop
basking
in
the
sun
the
high
street
was
in
a
state
of
repose
and
there
was
no
likelihood
of
a
customer
to
interfere
with
his
confidential
chat
with
nathan
smith
who
was
listening
with
an
aspect
of
great
severity
to
his
explanations
ought
not
to
happened
he
said
sharply
was
teddy
done
it
said
kybird
humbly
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
would
happened
if
i
been
there
he
observed
arrogantly
do
see
began
kybird
o
course
you
do
said
his
friend
it
no
use
making
a
fuss
now
the
thing
is
done
one
thing
is
i
do
suppose
it
make
any
diff
suggested
kybird
after
waiting
for
him
to
finish
said
smith
with
an
obvious
effort
his
face
had
lost
its
scornful
expression
and
given
way
to
one
almost
sheepish
in
its
mildness
kybird
staring
at
him
in
some
surprise
even
thought
that
he
detected
a
faint
shade
of
pink
ai
all
as
clever
as
wot
you
are
nat
he
said
somewhat
taken
aback
at
this
phenomenon
would
smith
made
a
strange
noise
in
his
throat
and
turned
on
him
sharply
kybird
still
staring
in
surprise
at
his
unwonted
behaviour
drew
back
a
little
and
then
his
lips
parted
and
his
eyes
grew
round
as
he
saw
the
cause
of
his
friend
concern
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
neatly
trimmed
white
beard
and
a
yellow
rose
in
his
was
just
passing
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
his
tread
was
elastic
his
figure
as
upright
as
a
boy
and
he
swung
a
light
cane
in
his
hand
as
he
walked
as
kybird
gazed
he
bestowed
a
brisk
nod
upon
the
bewildered
smith
and
crossed
the
road
with
the
evident
intention
of
speaking
to
him
do
smith
he
said
in
a
kindly
voice
the
leaned
against
the
and
regarded
him
dumbly
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
shipbroker
eyes
which
irritated
him
almost
beyond
endurance
and
in
the
doorway
kybird
his
face
mottled
with
the
intensity
of
his
emotions
stood
an
unwelcome
and
frantic
witness
of
his
shame
not
well
smith
said
swann
shaking
his
head
at
him
gently
look
like
a
man
who
has
been
doing
too
much
lately
you
been
getting
the
better
of
i
smith
gasped
and
eyeing
him
wickedly
strove
hard
to
recover
his
all
right
sir
he
said
in
a
thin
voice
glad
to
see
you
looking
a
trifle
better
i
quite
right
now
said
the
other
with
a
genial
smile
at
the
fermenting
kybird
as
well
as
ever
i
was
illness
is
a
serious
thing
smith
but
it
is
not
without
its
little
smith
scratching
his
chin
and
staring
blankly
in
front
of
him
said
that
he
was
glad
to
hear
it
had
a
long
bout
of
it
continued
the
than
i
intended
at
first
by
the
way
smith
you
never
spoken
to
anybody
of
that
business
of
course
course
not
sir
said
the
grinding
his
teeth
has
fancies
when
one
is
ill
said
swann
in
low
tones
as
his
eye
dwelt
with
pleasure
on
the
strained
features
of
kybird
burnt
the
document
five
minutes
after
you
had
you
reely
said
smith
mechanically
glad
it
was
only
you
and
the
doctor
that
saw
my
foolishness
continued
the
other
still
in
a
low
voice
people
might
have
talked
but
i
knew
that
you
were
a
reliable
man
smith
and
you
wo
talk
about
it
in
the
future
i
quite
certain
of
that
good
smith
managed
to
say
afternoon
and
stood
watching
the
receding
figure
as
though
it
belonged
to
a
species
hitherto
unknown
to
him
then
he
turned
in
obedience
to
a
passionate
tug
at
his
coat
sleeve
from
kybird
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
demanded
that
injured
person
in
tones
of
suppressed
passion
do
you
mean
by
it
you
made
a
pretty
mess
of
it
with
your
old
gentleman
ai
he
said
the
discomfited
smith
getting
the
better
o
me
fancy
me
being
i
took
it
all
in
as
innercent
as
you
you
a
clever
fellow
you
are
said
kybird
bitterly
amelia
lost
young
nugent
and
five
all
through
you
it
a
thing
between
old
swann
and
the
nugent
lot

picking
me
out
for
games

over
about
all
that
money

paid
for
the
license

kybird
in
a
threatening
manner
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
shall
it
said
the
with
sudden
blandness
shall
five
inquired
the
other
staring
as
easy
as
easy
said
smith
who
had
been
greatly
galled
by
his
friend
manner
leave
it
in
my
will
that
the
cheapest
way
o
giving
money
i
know
of
and
while
i
about
it
i
leave
you
a
decent
pair
o
trousers
and
a
shirt
with
your
own
name
on
while
an
ancient
friendship
was
thus
being
dissolved
adolphus
swann
was
on
the
way
to
his
office
he
could
never
remember
such
a
pleasant
air
from
the
water
and
such
a
vivid
enjoyment
in
the
sight
of
the
workaday
world
he
gazed
with
delight
at
the
crowd
of
miscellaneous
shipping
in
the
harbour
and
the
bustling
figures
on
the
quay
only
pausing
occasionally
to
answer
anxious
inquiries
concerning
his
health
from
seafaring
men
in
tarry
trousers
who
had
waylaid
him
with
great
pains
from
a
distance
he
reached
his
office
at
last
and
having
acknowledged
the
respectful
greetings
of
mr
silk
passed
into
the
private
room
and
celebrated
his
return
to
work
by
at
once
arranging
with
his
partner
for
a
substantial
rise
in
the
wages
of
that
useful
individual
conscience
is
troubling
me
he
declared
as
he
hung
up
his
hat
and
gazed
round
the
room
with
much
relish
is
happy
enough
said
hardy
is
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
should
like
to
raise
everybody
wages
said
the
benevolent
swann
as
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
is
like
a
holiday
to
me
after
being
cooped
up
in
that
bedroom
but
the
rest
has
done
me
a
lot
of
good
so
blaikie
says
and
now
what
is
going
to
happen
to
you
hardy
shook
his
head
while
the
iron
is
hot
said
the
and
see
captain
nugent
before
he
has
got
used
to
the
situation
and
you
can
give
him
to
understand
if
you
like
only
be
careful
how
you
do
it
that
i
have
got
something
in
view
which
may
suit
his
son
if
you
fail
in
this
affair
after
all
i
done
for
you
i
enter
the
lists
the
advice
was
good
but
unnecessary
hardy
having
already
fixed
on
that
evening
as
a
suitable
opportunity
to
disclose
to
the
captain
the
nature
of
the
efforts
he
had
been
making
on
his
behalf
the
success
which
had
attended
them
had
put
him
into
a
highly
optimistic
mood
and
he
set
off
for
equator
lodge
with
the
confident
feeling
that
he
had
to
say
the
least
of
it
improved
his
footing
there
captain
nugent
called
away
from
his
labours
in
the
garden
greeted
his
visitor
in
his
customary
short
manner
as
he
entered
the
room
you
come
to
tell
me
about
this
marriage
i
heard
of
it
he
said
bluntly
told
me
this
did
tell
you
how
it
was
brought
about
i
suppose
said
hardy
the
captain
shook
his
head
did
ask
him
he
said
with
affected
indifference
and
sat
gazing
out
at
the
window
as
hardy
began
his
narration
two
or
three
times
he
thought
he
saw
signs
of
appreciation
in
his
listener
face
but
the
mouth
under
the
heavy
moustache
was
firm
and
the
eyes
steady
only
when
he
related
swann
interview
with
nathan
smith
and
kybird
did
the
captain
features
relax
he
gave
a
chuckling
cough
and
feeling
for
his
handkerchief
blew
his
nose
violently
then
with
a
strange
gleam
in
his
eye
he
turned
to
the
young
man
opposite
smart
he
said
shortly
was
successful
said
the
other
modestly
said
the
captain
as
he
rose
and
confronted
him
am
much
obliged
of
course
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
in
the
affairs
of
my
family
and
now
i
will
remind
you
of
our
repeated
the
other
the
captain
nodded
visits
to
me
were
to
cease
when
this
marriage
happened
if
i
wished
it
he
said
slowly
was
the
arrangement
said
the
hardy
i
had
hoped
besides
it
has
all
taken
place
much
sooner
than
i
had
was
the
bargain
said
the
captain
stiffly
now
i
bid
you
am
sorry
that
my
presence
should
be
so
distasteful
to
you
said
the
mortified
hardy
sir
said
the
captain
sternly
have
forced
yourself
on
me
for
twice
a
week
for
some
time
past
you
have
insisted
upon
talking
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
you
have
taken
every
opportunity
of
evading
my
wishes
that
you
should
not
see
my
daughter
and
you
wonder
that
i
object
to
you
for
absolute
brazenness
you
beat
anything
i
have
ever
am
sorry
said
hardy
again
evening
said
the
captain
crestfallen
and
angry
hardy
moved
to
the
door
pausing
with
his
hand
on
it
as
the
captain
spoke
again
word
more
said
the
older
man
gazing
at
him
oddly
as
he
stroked
his
grey
beard
ever
you
try
to
come
bothering
me
with
your
talk
again
i
forbid
you
the
me
the
house
repeated
the
astonished
hardy
what
i
said
replied
the
other
plain
english
is
it
hardy
looked
at
him
in
bewilderment
then
as
the
captain
meaning
dawned
upon
him
he
stepped
forward
impulsively
and
seizing
his
hand
began
to
stammer
out
incoherent
thanks
better
clear
before
i
alter
my
mind
said
captain
nugent
roughly
had
more
than
enough
of
you
try
the
garden
if
you
he
took
up
a
paper
from
the
table
and
resumed
his
seat
not
without
a
grim
smile
at
the
promptitude
with
which
the
other
obeyed
his
instructions
miss
nugent
reclining
in
a
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
looked
up
as
she
heard
hardy
footstep
on
the
gravel
it
was
a
surprising
thing
to
see
him
walking
down
the
garden
it
was
still
more
surprising
to
observe
the
brightness
of
his
eye
and
the
easy
confidence
of
his
bearing
it
was
evident
that
he
was
highly
pleased
with
himself
and
she
was
not
satisfied
until
she
had
ascertained
the
reason
then
she
sat
silent
reflecting
bitterly
on
the
clumsy
frankness
of
the
male
sex
in
general
and
fathers
in
particular
a
recent
conversation
with
the
captain
in
which
she
had
put
in
a
casual
word
or
two
in
hardy
favour
was
suddenly
invested
with
a
new
significance
shall
never
be
able
to
repay
your
father
for
his
kindness
said
hardy
meaningly
as
he
took
a
chair
near
her
expect
he
was
pleased
at
this
marriage
said
miss
nugent
coldly
did
it
happen
hardy
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
is
much
to
tell
he
said
reluctantly
you
you
might
not
approve
of
the
means
by
which
the
end
was
i
want
to
hear
about
it
said
miss
nugent
for
the
second
time
that
evening
hardy
told
his
story
it
seemed
more
discreditable
each
time
he
told
it
and
he
scanned
the
girl
face
anxiously
as
he
proceeded
but
like
her
father
she
sat
still
and
made
no
comment
until
he
had
finished
then
she
expressed
a
strong
feeling
of
gratitude
that
the
nugent
family
had
not
been
mixed
up
in
it
inquired
hardy
bluntly
do
think
it
was
a
very
nice
thing
to
do
said
miss
nugent
with
a
superior
air
would
have
been
a
very
nice
thing
for
you
if
your
brother
had
married
miss
kybird
said
the
indignant
jem
you
said
if
you
remember
that
you
did
mind
what
i
do
said
miss
nugent
noticing
with
pleasure
that
the
confident
air
of
a
few
minutes
ago
had
quite
disappeared
think
i
have
been
behaving
badly
pursued
hardy
would
rather
not
say
what
i
think
replied
miss
nugent
loftily
have
no
doubt
you
meant
well
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
hurt
your
you
said
hardy
and
sat
gloomily
gazing
about
him
for
some
time
neither
of
them
spoke
is
jack
now
inquired
the
girl
at
last
is
staying
with
me
for
a
few
days
said
hardy
sincerely
hope
that
the
association
will
not
be
injurious
to
you
trying
to
be
rude
to
me
inquired
miss
nugent
raising
her
clear
eyes
to
his
am
sorry
said
hardy
hastily
are
quite
right
of
course
it
was
not
a
nice
thing
to
do
but
i
would
do
a
thousand
times
worse
to
please
miss
nugent
thanked
him
warmly
he
seemed
to
understand
her
so
well
she
said
mean
said
hardy
leaning
forward
and
speaking
with
a
vehemence
which
made
the
girl
instinctively
avert
her
head
mean
that
to
please
you
would
be
the
greatest
happiness
i
could
know
i
love
miss
nugent
sat
silent
and
a
strong
sense
of
the
monstrous
unfairness
of
such
a
sudden
attack
possessed
her
such
a
declaration
she
felt
ought
to
have
been
led
up
to
by
numerous
delicate
gradations
of
speech
each
a
little
more
daring
than
the
last
but
none
so
daring
that
they
could
not
have
been
checked
at
any
time
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
firmness
you
would
do
anything
to
please
me
she
said
at
length
in
a
low
voice
and
without
turning
her
head
you
promise
never
to
try
and
see
me
or
speak
to
me
again
if
i
asked
you
said
hardy
promptly
miss
nugent
sat
silent
again
she
knew
that
a
good
woman
should
be
sorry
for
a
man
in
such
extremity
and
should
endeavour
to
spare
his
feelings
by
softening
her
refusal
as
much
as
possible
little
as
he
might
deserve
such
consideration
but
man
is
impatient
and
jumps
at
conclusions
before
she
was
through
the
first
sentence
he
leaned
forward
and
took
her
hand
she
said
turning
to
him
with
a
pleasant
smile
am
not
going
said
hardy
quietly
am
never
going
he
added
as
he
took
her
other
hand
captain
nugent
anxious
for
his
supper
found
them
there
still
debating
the
point
some
two
hours
later
kate
nugent
relieved
at
the
appearance
of
her
natural
protector
clung
to
him
with
unusual
warmth
then
in
a
kindly
hospitable
fashion
she
placed
her
other
arm
in
that
of
hardy
and
they
walked
in
grave
silence
to
the
house
the
end
