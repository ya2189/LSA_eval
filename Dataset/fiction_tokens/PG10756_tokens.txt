in
the
days
when
new
england
was
only
a
group
of
thinly
settled
wildernesses
called
provinces
there
was
something
almost
like
the
old
feudal
tenure
of
lands
there
and
a
relation
between
the
rich
and
his
tenants
which
had
many
features
in
common
with
those
of
the
relation
between
margraves
and
vassals
in
the
days
of
charlemagne
far
up
in
the
north
near
the
canada
line
there
lived
at
that
time
an
eccentric
old
man
whose
name
is
still
to
be
found
here
and
there
on
the
tattered
parchments
written
willan
blaycke
gentleman
tradition
occupies
itself
a
good
deal
with
willan
blaycke
and
does
not
give
his
misdemeanors
the
as
it
might
have
done
if
he
had
been
either
a
poorer
or
a
less
clever
man
why
he
had
crossed
the
seas
and
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
pious
puritans
nobody
knew
it
was
certainly
not
because
of
sympathy
with
their
faith
and
lives
nor
from
any
liking
for
hardships
or
simplicity
of
habits
he
had
gold
enough
the
stories
say
to
have
bought
all
the
land
from
the
johns
to
the
connecticut
if
he
had
pleased
and
he
had
servants
and
horses
and
attire
such
as
no
governor
in
all
the
provinces
could
boast
he
built
himself
a
fine
house
out
of
stone
and
the
life
he
led
in
it
was
a
scandal
and
a
byword
everywhere
for
all
that
there
was
not
a
man
to
be
found
who
had
not
a
good
word
to
say
for
willan
blaycke
and
not
a
woman
who
did
not
look
pleased
and
smile
if
he
so
much
as
spoke
to
her
he
was
generous
with
a
generosity
so
princely
that
there
were
many
who
said
that
he
had
no
doubt
come
of
some
royal
house
he
gave
away
a
farm
and
another
and
thought
nothing
of
it
and
when
tenants
came
to
him
pleading
that
they
were
unable
to
pay
their
rent
he
was
never
known
to
haggle
or
insist
naturally
with
such
ways
as
these
he
made
havoc
of
his
estates
vast
as
they
were
and
grew
less
and
less
rich
year
by
year
however
there
was
enough
of
his
land
to
last
several
generations
out
and
if
he
had
married
a
decent
woman
for
his
wife
his
posterity
need
never
have
complained
of
him
but
this
was
what
willan
blaycke
did
and
it
is
as
much
a
mystery
now
as
it
doubtless
was
then
why
he
did
it
he
married
jeanne
dubois
the
daughter
of
a
and
frenchman
who
kept
a
small
inn
on
the
canadian
frontier
jeanne
had
a
handsome
but
wicked
face
she
stood
always
at
the
bar
and
served
every
man
who
came
and
a
great
thing
it
was
for
the
house
to
be
sure
that
she
had
such
bold
black
eyes
red
cheeks
and
a
tongue
even
bolder
than
her
glances
but
there
was
not
a
farmer
in
all
the
north
provinces
who
would
have
taken
her
to
wife
not
one
for
she
bore
none
too
good
a
name
and
speech
about
her
as
soon
as
they
had
turned
their
backs
and
gone
on
their
journeys
was
quite
opposite
to
the
gallant
and
flattering
things
they
said
to
her
face
in
the
bar
some
people
said
that
willan
blaycke
was
drunk
when
he
married
jeanne
that
she
took
him
unawares
by
means
of
a
base
plot
which
her
father
and
she
had
had
in
mind
a
long
time
others
said
that
he
was
sober
enough
when
he
did
it
only
that
he
was
like
one
out
of
his
mind
he
sorrowed
so
for
the
loss
of
his
only
son
willan
whom
he
had
in
the
beginning
of
that
year
sent
back
to
england
to
be
taught
in
school
he
had
brought
the
child
out
with
him
a
little
chap
with
marvellously
black
eyes
and
yellow
curls
who
wore
always
the
costliest
of
embroidered
coats
which
it
was
plain
some
woman
hand
had
embroidered
for
him
but
whether
the
child
mother
were
dead
or
alive
willan
blaycke
never
told
and
nobody
dared
ask
that
the
boy
needed
a
mother
sadly
enough
was
only
too
plain
riding
from
county
to
county
on
his
little
white
pony
by
his
father
side
sitting
up
late
at
roystering
feasts
till
he
nodded
in
his
chair
seeing
all
that
rough
men
saw
and
hearing
all
that
rough
men
said
the
child
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
ruined
outright
and
so
willan
blaycke
at
last
came
to
see
and
one
day
in
a
fit
of
unwonted
conscientiousness
and
wisdom
he
packed
the
poor
sobbing
little
fellow
off
to
england
in
charge
of
a
trusty
escort
and
sternly
made
up
his
mind
that
the
lad
should
not
return
till
he
was
a
man
grown
it
was
only
a
few
months
after
this
that
jeanne
dubois
became
mistress
willan
blaycke
so
it
seemed
not
improbable
that
the
bereaved
father
loneliness
had
had
much
to
do
with
that
extraordinary
step
be
that
as
it
may
whether
he
were
drunk
or
sober
when
he
married
her
he
treated
her
as
a
gentleman
should
treat
his
wife
and
did
his
best
to
make
her
a
lady
she
was
always
clad
in
a
rich
fashion
and
a
fine
show
she
made
in
her
scarlet
petticoat
and
white
hat
with
a
streaming
scarlet
feather
in
it
riding
high
on
her
pillion
behind
willan
blaycke
on
his
great
black
horse
or
sitting
up
straight
and
stiff
in
the
swinging
coach
with
gold
on
the
panels
which
he
had
bought
for
her
in
boston
at
a
sale
of
the
effects
of
one
of
the
disgraced
and
removed
governors
of
the
province
of
massachusetts
if
there
had
been
any
roads
to
speak
of
in
those
days
jeanne
dubois
would
have
driven
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
land
in
her
fine
coach
so
proud
was
she
of
its
splendor
but
even
pride
could
not
heal
the
bruises
she
got
in
jolting
about
in
it
nor
the
terror
she
felt
of
being
overturned
so
she
gradually
left
off
using
it
and
consoled
herself
by
keeping
it
standing
in
all
good
weather
in
full
sight
from
the
highway
that
everybody
might
know
she
had
it
it
was
a
sore
trial
to
jeanne
that
she
had
no
children
a
sore
trial
also
to
her
wicked
old
father
who
had
plotted
that
the
great
blaycke
estates
should
go
down
in
the
hands
of
his
descendants
not
so
willan
blaycke
it
was
undoubtedly
a
consolation
to
him
in
his
last
days
to
think
that
his
son
willan
would
succeed
to
everything
and
the
dubois
blood
remain
still
in
its
own
muddy
channel
it
is
evident
that
before
he
died
he
had
come
to
think
coldly
of
his
wife
for
his
mention
of
her
in
his
will
was
of
the
curtest
and
his
provision
for
her
during
her
lifetime
though
amply
sufficient
for
her
real
needs
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
the
style
in
which
she
had
dwelt
with
him
the
exiled
willan
had
returned
to
america
a
year
before
his
death
he
was
a
quiet
rather
scholarly
young
man
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
that
his
filial
sentiment
had
grown
cool
during
the
long
years
of
his
absence
and
that
it
received
some
violent
shocks
on
his
return
to
his
father
house
but
he
was
full
of
ambition
and
soon
saw
the
opening
which
lay
before
him
for
distinction
and
wealth
as
the
ultimate
owner
of
the
blaycke
estates
to
this
end
he
bent
all
his
energies
he
had
had
in
england
a
good
legal
education
he
was
a
clear
thinker
and
a
ready
speaker
and
speedily
made
himself
so
well
known
and
well
thought
of
that
when
his
father
died
there
were
many
who
said
it
was
well
the
old
man
had
been
taken
away
in
time
to
leave
the
young
willan
a
property
worthy
of
his
talents
and
industry
willan
had
lived
in
his
father
house
more
as
a
guest
than
as
a
son
to
the
woman
who
was
his
father
wife
and
sat
at
the
head
of
his
table
he
bore
himself
with
a
distant
courtesy
which
was
far
more
irritating
to
her
coarse
nature
than
open
antagonism
would
have
been
but
jeanne
dubois
was
clever
woman
enough
to
comprehend
her
own
inferiority
to
both
father
and
son
and
to
avoid
collisions
with
either
she
had
won
what
she
had
played
for
and
on
the
whole
she
had
not
been
disappointed
as
she
had
never
loved
her
husband
she
cared
little
that
he
did
not
love
her
and
as
for
the
upstart
of
a
boy
with
his
fine
airs
well
she
would
bide
her
time
for
that
jeanne
thought
for
it
had
never
crossed
jeanne
mind
that
when
her
husband
died
she
would
not
be
still
the
mistress
of
the
fine
stone
house
and
the
gilt
panelled
coach
and
have
more
money
than
she
knew
what
to
do
with
many
malicious
reveries
she
had
indulged
in
as
to
how
when
that
time
came
she
would
send
the
fellow
packing
he
should
stay
in
her
house
a
day
so
when
it
came
to
pass
that
the
cards
were
turned
and
it
was
willan
who
said
to
her
on
the
morning
after
his
father
funeral
what
are
your
plans
madame
jeanne
was
for
a
few
seconds
literally
dumb
with
anger
and
astonishment
then
she
poured
out
all
the
hatred
of
her
vulgar
soul
it
was
a
horrible
scene
willan
conducted
himself
throughout
the
interview
with
perfect
calmness
the
same
impassable
distance
which
had
always
been
so
exasperating
to
jeanne
was
doubly
so
now
he
treated
her
as
if
she
were
merely
some
dependant
of
the
house
for
whom
he
as
the
executor
of
the
will
was
about
to
provide
according
to
instructions
if
i
ca
live
in
my
own
house
cried
the
angry
woman
i
go
back
to
my
father
and
tend
bar
again
and
how
you
like
that
it
is
purely
immaterial
to
me
madame
replied
willan
where
you
live
i
merely
wish
to
know
your
address
that
i
may
forward
to
you
the
quarterly
payments
of
your
annuity
i
should
think
it
probable
he
added
with
an
irony
which
was
not
thrown
away
on
jeanne
that
you
would
be
happier
among
your
own
relations
and
in
the
occupations
to
which
you
were
accustomed
in
your
youth
jeanne
was
not
deficient
in
spirit
as
soon
as
she
had
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
that
all
that
willan
had
told
her
was
true
and
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
her
ever
getting
from
the
estate
anything
except
her
annuity
she
packed
up
all
her
possessions
and
left
the
house
no
fine
instinct
had
restrained
her
from
laying
hands
on
everything
to
which
she
could
be
said
to
have
a
shadow
of
claim
indeed
on
many
things
to
which
she
had
not
and
even
willan
himself
who
had
been
prepared
for
her
probable
greed
was
surprised
when
on
returning
to
the
house
late
one
evening
he
found
the
piazza
piled
high
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
her
boxes
jeanne
stood
by
with
a
defiant
air
superintending
the
cording
of
the
last
one
she
anticipated
some
remonstrance
or
inquiry
from
willan
and
was
half
disappointed
when
he
passed
by
giving
no
sign
of
having
observed
the
boxes
at
all
and
simply
lifting
his
hat
to
her
with
his
usual
formality
the
next
morning
instead
of
the
public
vehicle
which
jeanne
had
engaged
to
call
for
her
her
own
coach
and
the
gray
horses
she
had
best
liked
were
driven
to
the
door
this
unexpected
tribute
from
willan
almost
disarmed
her
for
the
moment
it
was
her
coach
almost
more
than
her
house
which
she
had
grieved
to
lose
well
really
willan
she
exclaimed
i
never
once
thought
of
taking
that
though
there
no
doubt
about
its
being
my
own
and
your
father
tell
you
so
if
he
was
here
and
the
horses
too
he
always
said
the
grays
were
mine
from
the
day
he
bought
them
but
i
much
obliged
to
you
i
sure
you
have
no
occasion
to
thank
me
madame
replied
willan
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
pale
with
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
immediate
freedom
from
the
presence
of
the
coarse
creature
the
coach
is
your
own
and
the
horses
and
if
they
had
not
been
i
should
not
have
permitted
them
to
remain
here
oh
ho
sneered
jeanne
all
her
antagonism
kindled
afresh
at
this
last
gratuitous
fling
you
need
think
you
can
get
rid
of
everything
that
remind
you
of
me
young
man
you
see
me
oftener
than
you
like
at
the
golden
pear
you
have
to
stop
there
as
your
father
did
before
you
and
jeanne
black
eyes
snapped
viciously
as
she
drove
off
her
piles
of
boxes
following
slowly
in
two
behind
willan
was
right
in
one
thing
after
the
first
mortification
of
returning
to
her
father
house
a
widow
disgraced
by
being
pensioned
off
from
her
old
home
had
worn
away
jeanne
was
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
her
annuity
which
was
small
for
mistress
willan
blaycke
was
large
for
jeanne
daughter
of
the
landlord
of
the
golden
pear
and
into
that
position
she
sank
back
at
once
so
contentedly
too
that
her
father
was
continually
reproaching
her
with
a
great
lack
of
spirit
it
was
a
sad
from
his
old
for
her
and
for
himself
he
still
the
landlord
of
a
shabby
little
inn
and
jeanne
stout
and
sitting
again
behind
the
bar
as
she
had
done
fifteen
years
before
it
was
pretty
hard
so
long
as
he
knew
that
jeanne
was
living
in
her
fine
house
as
mistress
blaycke
he
had
been
content
in
spite
of
willan
blaycke
having
sternly
forbidden
him
ever
to
show
his
face
there
but
this
last
downfall
was
too
much
victor
dubois
ground
his
teeth
and
swore
many
oaths
over
it
but
no
swearing
could
alter
things
and
after
a
while
victor
himself
began
to
take
comfort
in
having
jeanne
back
again
and
not
a
bit
spoiled
as
he
would
say
to
his
cronies
by
all
the
fine
ways
to
which
she
had
never
taken
thanks
to
god
jeanne
was
as
good
a
girl
yet
as
ever
and
as
handsome
too
the
politic
cronies
would
add
the
golden
pear
was
a
much
more
attractive
place
since
jeanne
had
come
back
she
was
a
good
housekeeper
and
she
had
learned
much
in
willan
blaycke
house
moreover
she
was
a
generous
creature
and
did
not
in
the
least
mind
spending
a
few
dollars
here
and
there
to
make
things
tidier
and
more
comfortable
a
few
weeks
after
jeanne
return
to
the
inn
there
appeared
in
the
family
a
new
and
by
no
means
insignificant
member
this
was
the
young
victorine
dubois
who
was
a
daughter
they
said
of
victor
dubois
son
jean
the
twin
brother
of
jeanne
he
had
gone
to
montreal
many
years
ago
and
had
been
moderately
prosperous
there
as
a
in
a
small
way
he
had
been
dead
now
for
two
years
and
his
widow
being
about
to
marry
again
was
anxious
to
get
the
young
victorine
off
her
hands
so
the
story
ran
and
on
the
surface
it
looked
probable
enough
but
montreal
was
not
a
great
way
off
from
the
parish
of
urbans
in
which
stood
victor
dubois
inn
there
were
men
coming
and
going
often
who
knew
the
city
and
who
looked
puzzled
when
it
was
said
in
their
hearing
that
victorine
was
the
eldest
child
of
jean
dubois
the
she
had
been
kept
at
a
convent
all
these
years
old
victor
said
her
father
being
determined
that
at
least
one
of
his
children
should
be
well
educated
nobody
could
gainsay
this
and
mademoiselle
victorine
certainly
had
the
air
of
having
been
much
better
trained
and
taught
than
most
girls
in
her
station
but
somehow
nobody
quite
knew
why
the
tale
of
her
being
jean
dubois
daughter
was
not
believed
suspicions
and
at
last
rumors
were
afloat
that
she
was
an
illegitimate
child
of
jeanne
born
a
few
years
before
her
marriage
to
willan
blaycke
nothing
easier
everybody
knew
than
for
mistress
willan
blaycke
to
have
supported
half
a
dozen
illegitimate
children
if
she
had
had
them
on
the
money
her
husband
gave
her
so
lavishly
and
there
was
old
victor
as
ready
and
unscrupulous
a
as
ever
an
unscrupulous
woman
needed
these
rumors
gained
all
the
easier
credence
because
victorine
bore
so
striking
a
resemblance
to
her
aunt
jeanne
on
the
other
hand
this
ought
not
to
have
been
taken
as
proof
any
more
one
way
than
the
other
for
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
recollected
very
well
that
in
the
days
when
little
jean
and
jeanne
toddled
about
together
as
children
nobody
but
their
mother
could
tell
them
apart
except
by
their
clothes
so
the
winds
of
gossiping
breaths
blew
both
ways
at
once
in
the
matter
and
it
was
much
discussed
for
a
time
but
like
all
scandals
as
soon
as
it
became
an
old
story
nobody
cared
whether
it
were
false
or
true
and
before
victorine
had
been
a
year
at
the
golden
pear
the
question
of
her
relationship
there
was
rarely
raised
one
thing
was
certain
that
no
mother
could
have
been
fonder
or
more
devoted
to
a
child
than
jeanne
was
to
her
niece
and
everybody
said
so
some
more
civilly
some
maliciously
her
pride
in
the
girl
beauty
was
touching
to
see
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
she
was
ever
a
beauty
herself
and
she
had
no
need
to
do
this
for
jeanne
was
not
yet
forty
and
many
men
found
her
piquant
and
pleasing
still
but
all
her
vanity
seemed
now
to
be
transferred
to
victorine
it
was
victorine
who
was
to
have
all
the
fine
gowns
and
ornaments
victorine
who
must
go
to
the
dances
and
fêtes
in
costumes
which
were
the
wonder
and
the
envy
of
all
the
girls
in
the
region
victorine
who
was
to
have
everything
made
easy
and
comfortable
for
her
in
the
house
and
above
all
and
here
the
mother
betrayed
herself
for
mother
she
was
the
truth
may
as
well
be
told
early
as
late
in
our
story
most
of
all
it
was
victorine
who
was
to
be
kept
away
from
the
bar
and
to
be
spared
all
contact
with
the
rough
roysterers
who
frequented
the
golden
pear
very
ingenious
were
jeanne
excuses
for
these
restrictions
on
her
niece
liberty
still
more
ingenious
her
explanations
of
the
occasional
exceptions
she
made
now
and
then
in
favor
of
some
young
farmer
of
the
neighborhood
or
some
traveller
in
whom
her
alert
maternal
eye
detected
a
possible
suitor
for
victorine
hand
victorine
herself
was
not
so
fastidious
she
was
young
handsome
overflowing
with
vitality
and
with
no
more
conscience
or
delicacy
than
her
mother
had
had
before
her
if
the
whole
truth
had
been
known
concerning
the
last
four
years
of
her
life
in
the
convent
it
would
have
considerably
astonished
those
good
catholics
if
any
such
there
be
who
still
believe
that
convents
are
sacred
retreats
filled
with
the
chaste
and
the
devout
victorine
dubois
at
the
age
of
eighteen
when
her
grandfather
took
her
home
to
his
house
was
as
well
versed
a
young
woman
in
the
ways
and
the
wiles
of
as
if
she
had
been
free
to
come
and
go
all
her
life
and
that
this
knowledge
had
been
gained
surreptitiously
in
stolen
moments
and
brief
experiences
at
the
expense
of
the
whole
of
her
reverence
for
religion
the
whole
of
her
faith
in
men
purity
was
not
poor
victorine
fault
only
her
misfortune
but
the
result
was
no
less
disastrous
to
her
morals
she
went
out
of
the
convent
as
complete
a
little
hypocrite
as
ever
told
beads
and
repeated
prayers
only
a
certain
sort
of
infantile
superstitiousness
of
nature
remained
in
her
and
made
her
cling
to
the
forms
in
which
though
she
knew
they
did
not
mean
what
they
pretended
she
suspected
there
might
be
some
sort
of
mechanical
efficacy
at
last
like
the
partly
undeceived
disciple
and
assistant
of
a
master
juggler
who
is
not
quite
sure
that
there
may
not
be
a
supernatural
power
behind
some
of
the
tricks
beyond
an
overflowing
animal
vitality
and
a
passion
for
having
men
make
love
to
her
there
really
was
not
much
of
victorine
but
it
is
wonderful
how
far
these
two
qualities
can
pass
in
a
handsome
woman
for
other
and
nobler
ones
the
animal
life
so
keen
intense
sensuous
can
seem
like
cleverness
wit
taste
the
passion
for
receiving
homage
from
men
can
make
a
woman
graceful
amiable
and
alluring
some
of
the
greatest
passions
the
world
has
ever
seen
have
been
inspired
in
men
by
just
such
women
as
this
victorine
was
not
without
accomplishments
and
some
smattering
of
knowledge
she
had
read
a
good
deal
of
french
and
chattered
it
like
the
true
granddaughter
of
a
normandy
she
sang
in
a
way
snatches
of
songs
which
sounded
better
than
they
really
were
she
sang
them
with
so
much
heartiness
and
abandon
she
embroidered
exquisitely
and
had
learned
the
trick
of
making
many
of
the
pretty
and
useless
things
at
which
nuns
work
so
patiently
to
fill
up
their
long
hours
she
had
an
insatiable
love
of
dress
and
attired
herself
daily
in
successions
of
varied
colors
and
shapes
merely
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
on
the
chance
of
showing
herself
to
any
stray
traveller
who
might
come
the
inn
had
been
built
in
a
piecemeal
fashion
by
victor
dubois
himself
and
he
had
been
unconsciously
guided
all
the
while
by
his
memories
of
the
old
farmhouse
in
normandy
in
which
he
was
born
so
that
the
house
really
looked
more
like
normandy
than
like
america
it
had
on
one
corner
a
square
tower
which
began
by
being
a
shed
attached
to
the
kitchen
then
was
promoted
to
bearing
up
a
chamber
for
grain
and
at
last
was
topped
off
by
a
fine
airy
room
projecting
on
all
sides
over
the
other
two
and
having
great
casement
windows
reaching
close
up
to
the
broad
hanging
eaves
a
winding
staircase
outside
led
to
what
had
been
the
this
was
now
jeanne
room
the
room
above
was
victorine
and
she
reached
it
only
by
a
narrow
stairway
from
her
mother
bedroom
so
the
young
lady
movements
were
kept
well
in
sight
her
mother
thought
it
was
an
odd
thing
that
it
never
occurred
to
jeanne
how
near
the
sill
of
victorine
south
window
was
to
the
stout
railing
of
the
last
broad
platform
of
the
outside
staircase
this
railing
had
been
built
up
high
and
was
partly
roofed
over
making
a
pretty
place
for
pots
of
flowers
in
summer
and
victorine
never
looked
so
well
anywhere
as
she
did
leaning
out
of
her
window
and
watering
the
flowers
which
stood
there
many
a
flirtation
went
on
between
this
casement
window
and
the
courtyard
below
where
all
the
travellers
were
in
the
habit
of
standing
and
talking
with
the
ostlers
and
with
old
victor
himself
who
was
not
the
landlord
to
leave
his
ostlers
to
do
as
they
liked
with
horses
and
grain
many
a
flirtation
but
none
that
meant
or
did
any
harm
for
with
all
her
wildness
and
love
of
frolic
mademoiselle
victorine
never
lost
her
head
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
had
an
ambition
which
she
never
confessed
even
to
her
aunt
jeanne
she
had
read
enough
romances
to
believe
that
it
was
by
no
means
an
impossible
thing
that
a
landlord
daughter
should
marry
a
gentleman
and
to
marry
a
gentleman
if
she
married
at
all
victorine
was
fully
resolved
she
never
tired
of
questioning
her
aunt
about
the
details
of
her
life
in
willan
blaycke
house
and
she
sometimes
gazed
for
hours
at
the
coach
which
on
all
fine
days
stood
in
the
courtyard
of
the
golden
pear
the
wonder
of
all
rustics
on
the
rare
occasions
when
her
aunt
went
abroad
in
this
fine
vehicle
victorine
sat
by
her
side
in
an
ecstasy
of
pride
and
delight
it
seemed
to
her
that
to
be
the
owner
of
such
a
coach
as
that
to
live
in
a
fine
house
and
have
a
fine
gentleman
for
one
husband
must
be
the
very
climax
of
bliss
she
wondered
much
at
her
aunt
contentment
in
her
present
estate
how
canst
thou
bear
it
aunt
jeanne
she
said
sometimes
how
canst
thou
bear
to
live
as
we
live
here
to
be
in
the
with
the
men
and
to
sit
always
in
the
smoke
after
the
fine
rooms
and
the
company
thou
hadst
for
so
long
bah
jeanne
would
reply
it
little
thou
knowest
of
that
fine
company
i
had
like
to
die
of
weariness
more
often
than
i
was
gay
in
it
and
as
for
fine
rooms
i
care
nothing
for
them
but
thy
husband
aunt
jeanne
victorine
once
ventured
to
say
surely
thou
wert
not
weary
when
he
was
with
thee
jeanne
face
darkened
keep
a
civiller
tongue
in
thy
head
she
replied
than
to
be
talking
to
widows
of
the
husbands
they
have
buried
he
was
a
good
man
willan
blaycke
a
good
man
but
i
liked
him
not
overmuch
though
we
lived
not
in
quarrelling
he
went
his
ways
as
men
go
and
i
let
him
be
victorine
curiosity
was
by
no
means
satisfied
she
asked
endless
questions
of
all
whom
she
met
who
could
tell
her
anything
about
her
aunt
husband
very
much
she
regretted
that
she
had
not
been
taken
from
the
convent
before
this
strange
rollicking
gentleman
had
died
she
would
have
managed
affairs
better
she
thought
than
aunt
jeanne
had
done
romantic
visions
of
herself
as
his
favorite
flitted
through
her
brain
why
didst
thou
not
send
for
me
sooner
to
come
to
thee
aunt
jeanne
she
said
that
i
too
might
have
seen
the
life
in
the
great
stone
house
a
sudden
flush
covered
jeanne
face
was
she
never
to
hear
the
end
of
troublesome
questions
about
the
past
wilt
thou
never
have
done
with
it
she
said
half
angrily
has
it
never
been
said
in
thy
hearing
how
that
my
husband
would
not
permit
even
my
father
to
come
inside
of
his
house
much
less
one
no
nearer
than
thou
and
jeanne
eyed
victorine
sharply
with
a
suspicion
which
was
wholly
uncalled
for
nobody
had
ever
been
bold
or
cruel
enough
to
suggest
to
victorine
any
doubts
regarding
her
birth
the
girl
was
indignant
she
had
never
known
before
that
her
grandfather
had
been
thus
insulted
what
had
grandfather
done
she
cried
was
he
not
thy
father
too
being
thine
how
dared
thy
husband
treat
him
so
jeanne
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
a
latent
sense
of
justice
to
her
dead
husband
restrained
her
from
assenting
to
victorine
words
nay
she
said
there
are
many
things
thou
canst
not
understand
thy
grandfather
never
complained
willan
blaycke
treated
me
most
fairly
while
he
lived
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
boy
i
would
have
had
thee
in
the
stone
house
and
had
all
my
rights
why
did
the
boy
hate
thee
asked
victorine
what
is
he
like
as
like
to
a
magpie
as
one
magpie
is
to
another
said
jeanne
bitterly
with
his
fine
french
cloth
of
black
and
his
white
ruffles
and
his
long
words
in
his
mouth
ah
but
him
i
hate
it
is
to
him
we
owe
it
all
dwells
he
now
in
the
great
house
alone
said
victorine
ay
that
he
does
alone
with
his
books
of
which
he
has
about
as
many
as
there
are
leaves
on
the
trees
one
could
not
so
much
as
step
or
sit
for
a
book
in
one
way
i
did
hear
that
he
has
now
with
him
another
of
his
own
order
and
that
the
two
are
riding
all
over
the
country
marking
out
the
lines
anew
of
all
the
farms
and
writing
new
bonds
which
are
so
much
harder
on
men
than
the
old
ones
were
bah
but
he
has
the
soul
of
a
miser
in
him
for
all
his
handsome
face
is
he
then
so
very
handsome
aunt
jeanne
said
victorine
eagerly
ay
ay
child
i
give
him
his
due
for
that
evilly
as
he
has
treated
me
he
is
a
handsomer
man
than
his
father
was
and
when
his
father
and
i
were
married
there
was
not
a
woman
in
the
provinces
that
did
not
say
i
had
carried
off
the
handsomest
man
that
ever
strode
a
horse
i
like
to
have
had
thee
see
me
too
in
that
day
child
i
was
counted
as
handsome
as
he
though
never
think
it
now
but
i
would
think
it
cried
victorine
hotly
and
loyally
what
ails
thee
aunt
jeanne
did
i
not
hear
father
hennepin
himself
saying
to
thee
only
yesterday
that
thou
wert
comelier
than
ever
and
he
saw
thee
married
he
told
me
tut
tut
child
replied
jeanne
looking
pleased
none
know
better
than
the
priests
how
to
speak
idle
words
to
women
but
what
was
he
telling
thee
how
came
it
that
he
spoke
of
the
time
when
i
was
married
added
jeanne
again
suspicious
it
was
i
that
asked
him
replied
victorine
i
wish
always
so
much
that
i
had
been
with
thee
instead
of
in
the
convent
dear
aunt
does
this
son
of
thy
husband
this
handsome
young
man
who
is
so
like
unto
a
magpie
does
he
never
in
his
journeyings
come
this
way
ay
often
replied
jeanne
i
know
that
he
must
because
a
large
part
of
his
estate
lies
beyond
the
border
and
joins
on
to
this
parish
it
was
that
which
brought
his
father
here
in
the
beginning
and
there
is
no
other
inn
save
this
for
miles
up
and
down
the
border
where
he
can
tarry
but
it
is
likely
that
he
will
sooner
lie
out
in
the
fields
than
sleep
under
this
roof
because
i
am
here
i
had
looked
to
say
my
mind
to
him
as
often
as
he
came
and
that
it
would
be
a
sore
thing
to
him
to
see
his
father
wife
in
the
bar
i
know
beyond
a
doubt
i
have
often
said
to
myself
what
a
comfortable
spleen
i
should
experience
when
i
might
courtesy
to
him
and
say
would
you
be
pleased
to
take
sir
but
i
think
he
is
minded
to
rob
me
of
that
pleasure
for
it
is
certain
he
must
have
ridden
this
way
before
now
i
have
a
mind
to
burn
a
candle
to
the
virgin
said
victorine
slowly
that
he
may
come
here
i
would
like
for
once
to
set
my
eyes
on
his
face
an
unwonted
earnestness
in
victorine
tone
and
a
still
more
unwonted
seriousness
in
her
face
arrested
jeanne
attention
what
is
it
to
thee
to
see
him
or
not
to
see
him
eh
what
is
it
thou
hast
in
thy
silly
head
if
thou
thinkest
thou
couldst
win
him
over
to
take
us
back
to
live
in
his
house
again
which
is
my
own
house
to
be
sure
if
i
had
my
rights
thy
wits
are
i
can
tell
thee
that
cried
jeanne
he
has
the
pride
of
ten
thousand
devils
in
him
there
was
that
in
his
face
when
i
drove
away
from
the
door
and
he
standing
with
his
head
uncovered
too
which
i
tell
thee
if
i
had
been
a
man
i
could
have
killed
him
for
he
take
us
back
he
he
and
jeanne
laughed
a
bitter
laugh
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
thing
i
had
not
thought
of
any
such
thing
aunt
jeanne
replied
victorine
still
speaking
slowly
and
still
with
a
dreamy
expression
on
her
face
as
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
began
idly
plucking
the
blossoms
from
a
bough
of
the
big
which
was
now
all
white
with
flowers
and
buzzing
with
bees
dost
thou
not
think
the
bees
steal
a
little
sweet
that
ought
to
go
into
the
fruit
continued
the
artful
girl
who
did
not
choose
that
her
aunt
should
question
her
any
further
as
to
the
reason
of
her
desire
to
see
willan
blaycke
i
remember
that
once
father
anselmo
at
the
convent
said
to
me
he
thought
so
there
was
a
vine
of
the
wild
grape
which
ran
all
over
the
wall
between
the
cloister
and
the
convent
and
when
it
was
in
bloom
the
air
sickened
one
and
thou
couldst
hardly
go
near
the
wall
for
the
swarming
bees
that
were
drinking
the
honey
from
the
flowers
and
father
anselmo
said
one
evening
that
they
were
thieves
they
stole
sweet
which
ought
to
go
into
the
grapes
this
was
a
clever
diversion
it
turned
jeanne
thoughts
at
once
away
from
willan
blaycke
but
it
did
not
save
mademoiselle
victorine
from
a
catechising
quite
as
sharp
as
she
was
in
danger
of
on
the
other
subject
and
what
wert
thou
doing
talking
with
a
priest
in
the
garden
at
night
cried
jeanne
fiercely
is
that
the
way
maidens
are
trained
in
a
convent
shame
on
thee
victorine
what
hast
thou
revealed
the
virgin
forbid
answered
victorine
piously
racking
her
brains
meanwhile
for
a
ready
escape
from
this
dilemma
and
trying
in
her
fright
to
recall
precisely
what
she
had
just
said
i
said
not
that
he
told
it
to
me
in
the
garden
it
was
in
the
confessional
that
he
said
it
i
had
confessed
to
him
the
grievous
sin
of
a
horrible
rage
i
had
been
in
when
one
of
the
bees
had
stung
me
on
the
lip
as
i
was
gathering
the
cool
vine
leaves
to
lay
on
the
good
sister
clarice
forehead
who
was
ill
with
a
fever
eh
eh
said
jeanne
relieved
was
that
it
i
thought
it
could
not
be
thou
wert
in
the
garden
in
the
evening
hours
and
with
a
priest
oh
no
said
victorine
demurely
it
was
not
permitted
to
converse
with
the
priests
except
in
the
chapel
and
choking
back
an
amused
little
laugh
she
bounded
to
the
stairway
and
climbed
up
into
her
own
room
saints
what
an
ankle
the
girl
has
to
be
sure
thought
jeanne
as
she
watched
victorine
shapely
legs
slowly
vanishing
up
the
stair
what
has
filled
her
head
so
full
of
that
upstart
willan
i
wonder
a
thought
struck
jeanne
the
only
wonder
was
it
had
never
struck
her
before
in
her
sudden
excitement
she
sprung
from
her
chair
and
began
to
walk
rapidly
up
and
down
the
floor
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
forehead
she
tore
open
the
handkerchief
which
was
crossed
on
her
bosom
her
eyes
flashed
her
cheeks
grew
red
she
breathed
quicker
the
girl
handsome
enough
to
turn
any
man
head
and
twice
as
clever
as
i
ever
was
she
thought
she
sat
down
in
her
chair
again
the
idea
which
had
occurred
to
her
was
she
spoke
aloud
and
was
unconscious
of
it
ah
but
that
would
be
a
triumph
she
said
who
knows
who
knows
victorine
she
called
victorine
yes
aunt
replied
victorine
there
plenty
of
honey
left
in
the
flowers
to
keep
pears
sweet
after
the
bees
are
dead
said
jeanne
mischievously
and
went
downstairs
chuckling
over
her
new
secret
thought
i
never
let
the
child
know
i
thought
of
such
a
thing
she
mused
as
she
took
her
accustomed
seat
in
the
bar
i
bide
my
time
strange
things
have
happened
and
may
happen
again
what
a
queer
speech
of
aunt
jeanne
thought
victorine
at
her
casement
window
what
a
fool
i
was
to
have
said
anything
about
father
anselmo
poor
fellow
i
wonder
why
he
does
run
away
from
the
monastery
ii
the
south
wind
secret
when
it
blows
oh
what
man
knows
how
did
it
turn
the
rose
bud
into
a
rose
what
went
before
no
garden
shows
only
the
rose
what
hour
the
bitter
north
wind
blows
the
south
wind
knows
why
did
it
turn
the
rose
bud
into
a
rose
alas
the
garden
shows
a
dying
rose
jeanne
had
not
to
wait
long
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
this
conversation
with
victorine
the
big
was
still
with
bloom
and
the
tireless
bees
still
buzzed
thick
among
its
boughs
when
jeanne
standing
in
the
doorway
at
sunset
saw
two
riders
approaching
the
inn
at
her
first
glance
she
recognized
willan
blaycke
jeanne
mind
moved
quickly
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
she
had
sprung
back
into
the
and
said
to
her
father
father
father
be
quick
here
comes
willan
blaycke
riding
and
another
an
old
man
with
him
thou
must
tend
the
bar
for
hand
so
much
as
a
glass
of
gin
to
that
man
will
i
never
i
shut
myself
up
till
he
is
gone
nay
nay
jeanne
replied
victor
i
turn
him
from
my
door
he
to
get
no
lodging
under
this
roof
he
nor
his
i
promise
you
that
and
victor
was
bustling
angrily
to
the
door
this
did
not
suit
mistress
jeanne
at
all
in
great
dismay
inwardly
but
outwardly
with
slow
and
accents
as
if
reflecting
discreetly
she
replied
he
might
do
me
great
mischief
if
he
were
angered
father
all
the
moneys
go
through
his
hand
i
think
it
is
safer
to
speak
him
fair
he
hath
the
devil
own
temper
if
he
be
opposed
in
the
smallest
thing
it
has
cost
him
sore
enough
i
be
bound
to
find
himself
here
at
sundown
and
beholden
to
thee
for
shelter
it
is
none
of
his
will
to
come
i
know
that
well
enough
speak
him
fair
father
speak
him
fair
it
is
a
silly
fowl
that
pecks
at
the
hand
which
holds
corn
i
will
hide
myself
till
he
is
away
though
for
i
misgive
me
that
i
should
be
like
to
fly
out
at
him
but
jeanne
persisted
victor
but
jeanne
was
gone
speak
him
fair
father
take
no
note
that
aught
is
amiss
she
called
back
from
the
upper
stair
from
which
she
was
vanishing
into
her
chamber
i
will
send
victorine
to
wait
at
the
supper
he
hath
never
seen
her
and
need
not
to
know
that
she
is
of
our
kin
at
all
humph
muttered
victor
small
doubt
to
whom
the
girl
is
kin
if
a
man
have
eyes
in
his
head
and
he
would
have
argued
the
point
longer
with
jeanne
but
he
had
no
time
left
for
the
riders
had
already
turned
into
the
courtyard
and
were
giving
their
horses
in
charge
to
the
ostler
benoit
benoit
had
served
in
the
golden
pear
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
had
served
victor
dubois
father
in
normandy
had
come
with
his
young
master
to
america
and
was
nominally
his
servant
still
but
if
things
had
gone
by
their
right
names
at
the
golden
pear
old
benoit
would
not
have
been
called
servant
for
many
a
year
back
not
a
secret
in
that
household
which
benoit
had
not
shared
not
a
plot
he
had
not
helped
on
at
jeanne
marriage
he
was
the
only
witness
except
father
hennepin
and
there
were
some
who
recollected
still
with
what
extraordinary
chuckles
of
laughter
benoit
had
walked
away
from
the
chapel
after
that
ceremony
had
been
completed
to
the
young
victorine
benoit
had
been
devoted
ever
since
her
coming
to
the
inn
whenever
she
appeared
in
sight
the
old
man
came
to
gaze
on
her
and
stood
lingering
and
admiring
as
long
as
she
remained
thou
art
far
handsomer
than
thy
mother
ever
was
he
had
said
to
her
one
morning
soon
after
her
arrival
oh
didst
thou
know
my
mother
then
when
she
was
young
cried
victorine
she
is
not
handsome
now
though
she
is
newly
wed
when
she
came
to
see
me
in
the
convent
i
thought
her
very
ugly
when
didst
thou
know
her
benoit
benoit
was
very
red
in
the
face
and
began
to
toss
straw
vigorously
as
he
looked
away
from
victorine
and
answered
it
was
but
once
that
i
had
sight
of
her
when
master
jean
brought
her
here
after
they
were
married
thou
dost
not
favor
her
in
the
least
thou
art
like
master
jean
and
the
saints
know
that
that
last
is
the
holy
truth
whatever
the
rest
may
be
thought
benoit
as
he
bustled
about
the
courtyard
but
thy
tongue
is
the
tongue
of
an
imbecile
said
victor
following
him
into
the
stable
ay
that
it
is
sir
replied
benoit
humbly
i
had
like
to
have
bitten
it
off
before
i
had
finished
speaking
but
no
harm
came
not
this
time
replied
victor
but
the
next
thou
might
not
be
so
well
let
off
the
girl
has
a
sharper
wit
than
she
shows
ordinarily
she
hath
learned
too
well
the
ways
of
convents
i
trust
her
not
wholly
benoit
keep
thy
eyes
open
benoit
we
not
have
her
go
the
ways
of
her
mother
if
it
can
be
helped
and
the
worldly
and
immoral
old
grandfather
turned
on
his
heel
with
a
wicked
laugh
benoit
had
never
seen
young
willan
blaycke
but
he
knew
him
at
his
first
glance
the
son
he
muttered
under
his
breath
as
he
saw
him
alight
is
he
to
be
lodged
here
i
doubt
and
benoit
looked
about
for
victor
who
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
slowly
and
with
a
surly
face
he
came
forward
to
take
the
horses
what
you
about
old
man
wear
you
shoes
of
lead
take
our
horses
and
see
you
to
it
they
are
well
rubbed
down
before
they
have
aught
to
eat
or
drink
we
have
ridden
more
than
ten
leagues
since
the
noon
cried
the
elder
of
the
two
travellers
and
ought
to
have
ridden
more
said
the
younger
in
an
undertone
it
was
as
jeanne
had
said
a
sore
thing
to
willan
blaycke
to
be
forced
to
seek
a
night
shelter
in
the
golden
pear
tut
tut
said
the
other
what
odds
it
is
a
whimsey
a
weakness
of
yours
boy
what
the
woman
to
you
victor
dubois
who
had
come
up
now
heard
these
words
and
his
swarthy
cheek
was
a
shade
darker
benoit
who
had
lingered
till
he
should
receive
a
second
order
from
the
master
of
the
inn
as
to
the
horses
exchanged
a
quick
glance
with
victor
while
he
said
in
a
respectful
tone
two
horses
sir
for
the
night
the
glance
said
i
know
who
the
man
is
shall
we
keep
him
ay
benoit
victor
answered
see
that
jean
gives
them
a
good
rubbing
at
once
they
have
been
hard
ridden
poor
beasts
while
victor
was
speaking
these
words
his
eyes
said
to
benoit
bah
it
is
even
so
but
we
dare
not
do
otherwise
than
treat
him
fair
will
you
be
pleased
to
walk
in
gentlemen
and
what
shall
i
have
the
honor
of
serving
for
your
supper
he
continued
we
have
some
young
pigeons
if
your
worships
would
like
them
fat
as
partridges
and
still
a
bottle
or
two
left
of
our
last
autumn
cider
by
all
means
landlord
by
all
means
let
us
have
them
roasted
on
a
spit
man
do
you
hear
roasted
on
a
spit
and
let
your
cook
lard
them
well
with
fat
bacon
there
is
no
bird
so
fat
but
a
larding
doth
help
it
for
my
eating
said
the
elder
man
rubbing
his
hands
and
laughing
more
and
more
cheerily
as
his
companion
looked
each
moment
more
and
more
glum
no
i
not
go
in
said
willan
as
victor
threw
open
the
door
into
the
it
suits
me
better
to
sit
here
under
the
trees
until
supper
is
ready
and
he
threw
himself
down
at
the
foot
of
the
great
he
feared
to
see
jeanne
sitting
in
the
bar
as
she
had
threatened
the
ground
was
showered
thick
with
the
soft
white
petals
of
the
blossoms
which
were
now
past
their
prime
willan
picked
up
a
handful
of
them
and
tossed
them
idly
in
the
air
as
he
did
so
a
shower
of
others
came
down
on
his
face
thick
fast
they
half
blinded
him
for
a
moment
he
sprung
to
his
feet
and
looked
up
it
was
like
looking
into
a
snowy
cloud
he
saw
nothing
some
bird
flying
through
he
thought
and
lay
down
again
ah
luck
for
the
bees
the
flowers
are
in
flower
luck
for
the
bees
in
spring
ah
me
but
the
flowers
they
die
in
an
hour
no
summer
is
fair
as
the
spring
ah
luck
for
the
bees
the
honey
in
flowers
is
highest
when
they
are
on
wing
came
in
a
gay
provençal
melody
from
the
above
willan
head
and
another
shower
of
white
petals
fell
on
his
face
good
god
said
willan
blaycke
under
his
breath
what
witchcraft
is
going
on
here
what
girl
voice
is
that
and
he
sprang
again
to
his
feet
the
voice
died
slowly
away
the
singer
was
moving
farther
off
ah
woe
for
the
bees
the
flowers
are
dead
no
summer
is
fair
as
the
spring
ah
me
but
the
honey
is
thick
in
the
comb
is
a
long
time
now
since
spring
ah
woe
for
the
bees
that
honey
is
sweet
is
sweeter
than
anything
sweeter
than
anything
sweeter
than
anything
the
voice
grown
faint
now
repeated
this
refrain
over
and
over
as
the
syllables
of
sound
died
away
it
was
victorine
going
very
slowly
down
the
staircase
from
her
room
into
jeanne
and
it
was
victorine
who
had
accidentally
brushed
the
boughs
as
she
watered
her
plants
on
the
roof
of
the
outside
stairway
she
did
not
see
willan
lying
on
the
ground
underneath
and
she
did
not
think
that
willan
might
be
hearing
her
song
and
yet
was
her
head
full
of
willan
blaycke
as
she
went
down
the
staircase
and
not
a
little
did
she
quake
at
the
thought
of
seeing
him
below
jeanne
had
come
breathless
to
her
room
crying
victorine
victorine
that
son
of
my
husband
of
whom
we
were
talking
young
willan
blaycke
is
at
the
door
he
and
an
old
man
with
him
and
they
must
perforce
stay
here
all
night
now
it
would
be
a
shame
i
could
in
no
wise
bear
to
stand
and
serve
him
at
supper
wilt
thou
not
do
it
in
my
stead
there
are
but
the
two
and
the
wily
jeanne
pretended
to
be
greatly
distressed
as
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
went
on
in
truth
i
do
not
believe
i
can
look
on
his
face
at
all
i
will
keep
my
room
till
he
have
gone
his
way
the
villain
the
upstart
that
i
may
thank
for
all
my
trouble
oh
it
brings
it
all
back
again
to
see
his
face
and
jeanne
actually
brought
a
tear
or
two
into
her
wily
eyes
the
no
less
wily
victorine
tossed
her
head
and
replied
indeed
then
and
the
waiting
on
him
is
no
more
to
my
liking
than
to
thine
own
aunt
jeanne
i
did
greatly
desire
to
see
his
face
to
see
what
manner
of
man
he
could
be
that
would
turn
his
father
widow
out
of
her
house
but
i
think
benoit
may
hand
the
gentleman
his
wine
not
i
and
victorine
sauntered
saucily
to
the
window
and
looked
out
a
plague
on
all
their
tempers
thought
jeanne
impatiently
her
plans
seemed
to
be
thwarted
when
she
least
expected
it
for
a
few
moments
she
was
silent
revolving
in
her
mind
the
wisdom
of
taking
victorine
into
her
counsels
and
confiding
to
her
the
motive
she
had
for
wishing
her
to
be
seen
by
willan
blaycke
but
she
dreaded
lest
this
might
defeat
her
object
by
making
the
girl
jeanne
was
perplexed
and
in
her
perplexity
her
face
took
on
an
expression
as
if
she
were
grieved
victorine
who
was
much
dismayed
by
her
aunt
seeming
acquiescence
in
her
refusal
to
serve
the
supper
exclaimed
now
nay
nay
aunt
jeanne
do
not
look
grieved
i
will
indeed
go
down
and
serve
the
supper
if
thou
takest
it
so
to
heart
the
man
is
nothing
to
me
that
i
need
fear
to
see
him
thou
art
a
good
girl
replied
jeanne
much
relieved
and
little
dreaming
how
she
had
been
gulled
by
mademoiselle
victorine
thou
art
a
good
girl
and
thou
shalt
have
my
paduasoy
gown
if
thou
wilt
lay
thyself
out
to
see
that
all
is
at
its
best
both
in
the
bedrooms
and
for
the
supper
i
would
have
willan
blaycke
perceive
that
one
may
live
as
well
outside
of
his
house
as
in
it
and
victorine
she
added
with
an
attempt
at
indifference
in
her
tone
wear
thy
white
gown
thou
hadst
on
last
sunday
it
pleased
me
better
than
any
gown
thou
hast
worn
this
year
that
and
thy
black
silk
apron
with
the
red
lace
they
become
thee
so
victorine
had
arrayed
herself
in
the
white
gown
it
was
of
linen
quaintly
woven
with
a
tiny
star
thrown
up
in
the
pattern
and
shone
like
damask
the
apron
was
of
heavy
black
silk
trimmed
all
around
with
crimson
lace
and
crimson
lace
on
the
pockets
a
crimson
rose
in
victorine
black
hair
and
crimson
ribbons
at
her
throat
and
on
her
sleeves
completed
the
toilet
it
was
ravishing
and
nobody
knew
it
better
than
mademoiselle
victorine
herself
who
had
toiled
many
an
hour
in
the
convent
making
the
crimson
lace
for
the
precise
purpose
of
trimming
a
black
apron
with
it
if
ever
she
escaped
from
the
convent
and
who
had
chosen
out
of
fifty
at
the
last
parish
fair
the
one
whose
blossoms
matched
her
crimson
lace
there
is
a
picture
still
to
be
seen
of
victorine
in
this
costume
and
many
a
handsome
young
girl
having
copied
the
costume
exactly
for
a
fancy
ball
has
looked
from
the
picture
to
herself
and
from
herself
to
the
picture
and
gone
to
the
ball
dissatisfied
thinking
in
her
heart
after
all
i
do
look
half
as
well
in
it
as
that
french
girl
did
as
victorine
came
leisurely
down
the
stairs
half
singing
half
chanting
her
little
song
jeanne
looked
at
her
in
admiration
well
and
if
either
of
the
men
have
an
eye
for
a
pretty
girl
clad
in
attire
that
becomes
her
they
can
look
at
thee
my
victorine
that
black
apron
will
go
well
with
the
lavender
paduasoy
also
that
it
will
aunt
jeanne
answered
victorine
her
face
glowing
with
pleasure
i
can
never
thank
thee
enough
i
did
not
think
ever
to
have
the
paduasoy
for
my
own
all
my
gowns
are
for
thee
said
jeanne
in
a
voice
of
great
tenderness
i
shall
presently
take
to
the
wearing
of
black
it
better
suits
my
years
thou
canst
be
young
it
is
enough
i
am
an
old
woman
victorine
bent
over
and
kissed
her
aunt
and
whispered
fie
on
thee
aunt
jeanne
the
father
hennepin
does
not
think
thee
an
old
woman
neither
pierre
gaspard
from
the
mill
i
hear
the
men
when
they
are
talking
under
my
window
of
thee
thou
knowest
thou
mightest
wed
any
day
if
thou
hadst
the
mind
jeanne
shook
her
head
that
i
have
not
then
she
said
i
keep
the
name
of
willan
blaycke
for
all
that
of
any
man
hereabouts
which
can
be
offered
to
me
thou
art
the
one
to
wed
not
i
but
far
off
be
that
day
she
added
hastily
thou
art
young
for
it
yet
ay
replied
the
artful
young
maiden
that
am
i
and
i
think
i
will
be
old
before
any
man
make
a
drudge
of
me
i
like
my
freedom
better
and
now
will
i
go
down
and
serve
thy
stepson
the
handsome
magpie
the
reader
of
books
and
with
a
mocking
laugh
victorine
bounded
down
the
staircase
and
went
into
the
kitchen
her
grandfather
was
running
about
there
in
great
confusion
from
dresser
to
fireplace
to
table
to
pantry
back
and
forth
breathless
and
red
in
the
face
the
pigeons
were
sputtering
before
the
fire
and
the
odor
of
the
frying
bacon
filled
the
place
diable
girl
out
of
this
he
cried
this
is
no
place
for
thee
go
to
thine
aunt
she
did
bid
me
come
and
serve
the
supper
for
the
strangers
replied
victorine
she
herself
will
not
come
down
go
to
the
devil
thou
shalt
not
and
it
is
i
that
say
it
shouted
victor
and
victorine
terrified
fled
back
to
jeanne
and
reported
her
grandfather
words
poor
jeanne
was
at
her
wit
end
now
why
said
he
that
she
asked
i
know
not
replied
victorine
demurely
he
was
in
one
of
his
great
rages
and
i
do
think
that
the
pigeons
are
fast
burning
by
the
smell
bah
cried
jeanne
in
disgust
is
this
a
house
to
live
in
where
one
can
not
be
let
down
from
one
chamber
except
in
sight
of
the
highway
run
victorine
look
over
and
see
if
the
strangers
be
in
sight
i
must
go
down
to
the
kitchen
i
would
a
witch
were
at
hand
with
a
broom
or
a
tail
of
a
mare
i
mount
and
down
the
chimney
i
warrant
me
laughing
heartily
victorine
ran
to
reconnoitre
there
is
none
in
sight
she
cried
thou
canst
come
down
a
man
is
asleep
under
the
but
i
think
not
he
is
one
of
them
jeanne
ran
quickly
down
the
stairs
followed
by
victorine
who
as
she
entered
the
kitchen
again
took
up
her
position
in
one
corner
and
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
tapping
her
pretty
little
black
slippers
with
their
crimson
bows
impatiently
on
the
floor
jeanne
drew
her
father
to
one
side
and
whispered
in
his
ear
he
retorted
angrily
in
a
louder
tone
not
a
look
or
tone
was
lost
on
victorine
presently
the
old
man
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
back
to
the
pigeons
and
began
to
turn
the
spit
muttering
to
himself
in
french
jeanne
had
conquered
thy
grandfather
is
in
a
rage
she
said
to
victorine
because
we
must
give
meat
and
drink
to
the
man
who
has
treated
me
so
ill
that
is
why
he
did
not
wish
thee
to
serve
but
i
have
persuaded
him
that
it
is
needful
that
we
do
all
we
can
to
keep
willan
blaycke
well
disposed
to
us
he
might
withhold
from
me
all
my
money
if
he
so
chose
and
he
is
rich
and
we
are
but
poor
people
we
could
not
find
any
redress
so
do
thou
take
care
and
treat
him
as
if
thou
hadst
never
heard
aught
against
him
from
me
it
will
lie
with
thee
child
to
see
that
he
goes
not
away
angered
for
thy
grandfather
is
in
a
mood
when
the
saints
themselves
could
not
hold
his
tongue
if
he
have
a
mind
to
speak
keep
thou
out
of
his
sight
till
supper
be
ready
i
stay
here
till
all
is
done
between
the
kitchen
and
the
common
which
was
also
the
was
a
long
dark
at
one
end
of
which
was
a
small
storeroom
here
victorine
took
refuge
to
wait
till
her
aunt
should
call
her
to
serve
the
supper
the
window
of
this
storeroom
was
wide
open
the
shutter
had
fallen
off
the
hinges
several
days
before
and
benoit
had
forgotten
to
put
it
up
victorine
seated
herself
on
a
cider
cask
close
to
the
window
and
leaning
her
head
against
the
wall
began
to
sing
again
in
a
low
tone
she
had
a
habit
of
singing
at
all
times
and
often
hardly
knew
that
she
sang
at
all
the
provençal
melody
was
still
running
in
her
head
ah
luck
for
the
bees
the
flowers
are
in
flower
luck
for
the
bees
in
spring
ah
me
but
the
flowers
they
die
in
an
hour
no
summer
is
fair
as
the
spring
ah
luck
for
the
bees
the
honey
in
flowers
is
highest
when
they
are
on
wing
she
sang
then
suddenly
breaking
off
she
began
singing
a
wild
sad
melody
of
another
song
the
sad
spring
rain
it
has
come
at
last
the
graves
lie
plain
and
the
brooks
run
fast
and
drip
drip
drip
falls
the
sad
spring
rain
and
tears
fall
fresh
in
the
sad
spring
air
from
lovers
eyes
on
the
graves
laid
bare
it
was
very
dark
in
the
storeroom
it
was
dark
out
of
doors
the
moon
had
been
up
for
an
hour
but
the
sky
was
overcast
thick
with
clouds
willan
blaycke
was
still
asleep
under
the
his
head
was
only
a
few
feet
from
the
storeroom
window
the
sound
of
victorine
singing
reached
his
ears
but
did
not
at
first
waken
him
only
blended
confusedly
with
his
dreams
in
a
few
seconds
however
he
waked
sprang
to
his
feet
and
looked
about
him
in
bewilderment
out
of
the
darkness
seemingly
within
arm
reach
came
the
low
sweet
notes
and
drip
drip
drip
falls
the
sad
spring
rain
and
tears
fall
fresh
in
the
sad
spring
air
from
lovers
eyes
on
the
graves
laid
bare
groping
his
way
in
the
direction
from
which
the
voice
came
willan
stumbled
against
the
wall
of
the
house
and
put
his
hand
on
the
who
sings
in
here
he
cried
fumbling
in
the
empty
space
holy
mother
shrieked
victorine
and
ran
out
of
the
storeroom
letting
the
door
shut
behind
her
with
all
its
force
the
noise
echoed
through
the
inn
and
waked
willan
friend
who
was
also
taking
a
nap
in
one
of
the
old
chairs
in
the
rubbing
his
eyes
he
came
out
to
look
for
willan
he
met
him
on
the
threshold
ah
he
said
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
i
have
slept
in
a
chair
and
am
vastly
rested
the
lord
only
knows
where
i
have
been
answered
willan
laughing
i
too
have
slept
but
a
woman
with
a
voice
like
the
voice
of
a
wild
bird
has
been
singing
strange
melodies
in
my
ear
the
elder
man
smiled
the
dreams
of
young
men
he
said
are
wont
to
have
the
sound
of
women
voices
in
them
this
was
no
dream
retorted
willan
she
was
so
near
me
i
heard
the
panting
breath
with
which
she
cried
out
and
fled
when
i
made
a
step
towards
her
gentlemen
will
it
please
you
to
walk
in
to
supper
said
victor
appearing
in
the
doorway
with
a
clean
white
apron
on
and
no
trace
in
his
smiling
and
obsequious
countenance
of
the
rage
in
which
he
had
been
a
few
minutes
before
a
second
talk
with
jeanne
after
victorine
had
left
the
kitchen
had
produced
a
deep
impression
on
victor
mind
he
was
now
as
eager
as
jeanne
herself
for
the
meeting
between
victorine
and
willan
blaycke
the
pigeons
were
not
burned
after
all
most
savory
did
they
smell
and
willan
blaycke
and
his
friend
fell
to
with
a
will
saidst
thou
not
thou
hadst
some
of
thy
famous
pear
cider
left
landlord
asked
willan
ay
sir
my
granddaughter
has
gone
to
draw
it
she
will
be
here
in
a
trice
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
victorine
entered
bearing
in
her
left
hand
a
tray
with
two
curious
old
blue
tankards
on
it
in
her
right
hand
a
gray
stone
jug
with
blue
bands
at
its
neck
both
the
jug
and
the
tankards
had
come
over
from
normandy
years
ago
victorine
raised
her
eyes
and
looking
first
at
willan
then
at
his
friend
went
immediately
to
the
older
man
and
courtesying
gracefully
set
her
tray
down
on
the
table
by
his
side
and
filled
the
two
tankards
the
cider
was
like
champagne
it
foamed
and
sparkled
the
old
man
eyed
it
keenly
this
looks
like
the
cidre
mousseux
i
drank
at
littry
he
said
and
taking
up
his
tankard
tossed
it
off
at
a
draught
tastes
like
it
too
by
jove
he
said
old
man
out
of
what
fruits
in
this
bleak
country
dost
thou
conjure
such
a
drink
victor
smiled
praise
of
the
cider
of
the
golden
pear
went
to
his
heart
of
hearts
monsieur
has
been
in
calvados
he
said
it
is
kind
of
him
then
to
praise
this
poor
drink
of
mine
which
would
be
but
scorned
there
there
is
not
a
warm
enough
sunshine
to
ripen
our
pears
here
to
their
best
and
the
variety
is
not
the
same
but
such
as
they
are
i
have
an
orchard
of
twenty
trees
and
it
is
by
reason
of
them
that
the
inn
has
its
name
willan
was
not
listening
to
this
conversation
he
held
his
fork
with
a
bit
of
untasted
pigeon
on
it
uplifted
in
one
hand
with
the
other
he
drummed
nervously
on
the
table
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
victorine
who
stood
behind
the
old
man
chair
her
soft
black
eyes
glancing
quietly
from
one
thing
to
another
on
the
table
to
see
if
all
were
right
willan
gaze
did
not
escape
the
keen
eyes
of
victorine
grandfather
chuckling
inwardly
he
assumed
an
expression
of
great
anxiety
and
coming
closer
to
willan
chair
said
in
a
deprecating
tone
are
not
the
pigeons
done
to
your
liking
sir
you
do
not
eat
willan
started
dropped
his
fork
then
hastily
took
it
up
again
yes
yes
he
said
that
they
are
done
to
a
turn
and
he
fell
to
eating
again
but
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
the
face
of
the
girl
if
she
moved
his
gaze
followed
her
about
the
room
as
straight
as
a
steel
follows
on
after
a
magnet
and
when
she
stood
still
he
cast
furtive
glances
that
way
each
minute
in
very
truth
he
might
well
be
forgiven
for
so
doing
not
often
does
it
fall
to
the
lot
of
men
to
see
a
more
bewitching
face
than
the
face
of
victorine
dubois
many
a
woman
might
be
found
fairer
and
of
a
nobler
cast
of
feature
but
in
the
countenance
of
victorine
dubois
was
an
unaccountable
charm
wellnigh
independent
of
feature
of
complexion
of
all
which
goes
to
the
ordinary
summing
up
of
a
woman
beauty
there
was
in
the
glance
of
her
eye
a
something
i
know
not
what
which
no
man
living
could
wholly
resist
it
was
at
once
defiant
and
alluring
tender
and
mocking
artless
and
mischievous
no
man
could
make
it
out
no
man
might
see
it
twice
alike
in
the
space
of
an
hour
no
more
was
the
girl
herself
twice
alike
in
an
hour
or
a
day
for
that
matter
she
was
far
more
like
some
frolicsome
creature
of
the
woods
than
like
a
mortal
woman
the
quality
of
wildness
which
willan
had
felt
in
her
voice
was
in
her
nature
neither
her
grandfather
nor
her
mother
had
in
the
least
comprehended
her
during
the
few
months
she
had
lived
with
them
a
certain
gentleness
of
nature
which
was
far
more
physical
than
mental
far
more
an
idle
nonchalance
than
recognition
of
relations
to
others
had
blinded
them
to
her
real
capriciousness
and
selfishness
they
rarely
interfered
with
her
or
observed
her
with
any
discrimination
their
love
was
content
with
her
surface
of
good
humor
gayety
and
beauty
she
was
an
delight
and
pride
to
them
both
and
that
she
might
only
partially
reciprocate
this
fondness
never
crossed
their
minds
they
did
not
realize
that
during
all
these
eighteen
years
that
they
had
been
caring
planning
and
plotting
for
her
their
names
had
represented
nothing
in
her
mind
except
unseen
unknown
relatives
to
whom
she
was
indebted
for
support
but
to
whom
she
also
owed
what
she
hated
and
rebelled
against
her
imprisonment
in
the
convent
why
should
she
love
them
blood
tells
however
and
when
victorine
found
herself
free
and
face
to
face
with
the
grandfather
of
whom
she
had
so
long
heard
and
only
once
seen
and
the
aunt
jeanne
who
had
been
described
to
her
as
the
loving
benefactress
of
her
youth
she
had
a
new
and
affectionate
sentiment
towards
them
but
she
would
at
any
minute
have
calmly
sacrificed
them
both
for
the
furtherance
of
her
own
interests
and
the
thoughts
she
was
thinking
while
willan
blaycke
gazed
at
her
so
ardently
this
night
were
precisely
as
follows
if
i
could
only
have
a
good
chance
at
him
i
could
make
him
marry
me
i
see
it
in
his
face
i
suppose
i
never
see
aunt
jeanne
again
or
grandfather
but
what
of
that
i
play
my
cards
better
than
aunt
jeanne
did
i
know
that
much
let
me
once
get
to
be
mistress
of
that
stone
house
and
the
color
grew
deeper
and
deeper
on
victorine
cheeks
in
the
excitement
of
these
reflections
poor
girl
willan
blaycke
was
thinking
i
must
not
gaze
at
her
so
constantly
the
color
in
her
cheeks
betrays
that
i
distress
her
and
the
honest
gentleman
tried
his
best
to
look
away
and
bear
good
part
in
conversation
with
his
friend
it
was
a
doubly
good
stroke
on
the
part
of
the
wily
victorine
to
take
her
place
behind
the
elder
man
chair
it
looked
like
a
proper
and
modest
preference
on
her
part
for
age
and
it
kept
her
out
of
the
old
man
sight
and
in
the
direct
range
of
eyes
as
he
conversed
with
his
friend
when
she
had
occasion
to
hand
anything
to
willan
she
did
so
with
an
apparent
shyness
which
was
captivating
and
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
she
spoke
to
him
was
low
and
timid
old
victor
could
hardly
contain
himself
he
went
back
and
forth
between
the
and
kitchen
far
oftener
than
was
necessary
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
saying
to
jeanne
it
works
it
works
he
doth
gaze
the
eyes
out
of
his
head
at
her
the
girl
could
not
do
better
she
hath
affected
the
very
thing
which
will
snare
him
the
quickest
oh
no
father
thou
mistakest
victorine
she
hath
no
plan
of
snaring
him
it
was
with
much
ado
i
got
her
to
consent
to
serve
him
at
all
it
was
but
for
my
sake
she
did
it
victor
stared
at
jeanne
when
she
said
this
thou
hast
not
told
her
then
he
said
nay
that
would
have
spoiled
all
if
the
girl
herself
had
it
in
her
head
he
would
have
seen
it
victor
walked
slowly
back
into
the
and
took
further
and
closer
observations
of
mademoiselle
victorine
behavior
and
expressions
when
he
went
next
to
the
kitchen
he
clapped
jeanne
on
the
shoulder
and
said
with
a
laugh
is
a
wise
mother
knows
her
own
child
if
that
girl
in
yonder
be
not
bent
on
turning
the
head
of
willan
blaycke
before
she
sleeps
may
the
devil
fly
away
with
me
well
likely
he
may
if
thou
prove
not
too
heavy
a
load
retorted
the
filial
jeanne
i
tell
thee
the
girl
heart
is
full
of
anger
against
willan
blaycke
she
is
but
doing
my
bidding
i
charged
her
to
see
to
it
that
he
was
pleased
that
he
should
go
away
our
friend
and
so
he
will
go
replied
victor
dryly
but
not
for
thy
bidding
or
mine
the
man
is
that
far
pleased
already
that
he
shifteth
as
if
the
very
chair
were
hot
beneath
him
a
most
dutiful
niece
thou
hast
mistress
jeanne
when
supper
was
over
willan
blaycke
walked
hastily
out
of
the
house
he
wanted
to
be
alone
the
clouds
had
broken
away
and
the
full
moon
shone
out
gloriously
the
great
looked
like
a
tree
wrapped
in
cloud
its
blossoms
were
so
thick
and
white
willan
paced
back
and
forth
beneath
it
where
he
had
lain
sleeping
before
supper
he
looked
toward
the
window
from
whence
he
had
heard
the
singing
voice
it
must
have
been
she
he
said
how
shall
i
bring
it
to
pass
to
see
her
again
for
that
i
will
and
must
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
in
all
was
dark
as
he
turned
away
the
door
at
the
farther
end
opened
and
a
ray
of
light
flashing
in
from
the
hall
beyond
showed
victorine
bearing
in
her
hand
the
jug
of
cider
she
had
made
this
excuse
to
go
to
the
storeroom
again
having
observed
that
willan
had
left
the
house
he
might
seek
me
again
there
thought
she
willan
heard
the
sound
turned
back
and
bounding
to
the
window
exclaimed
was
it
thou
who
sang
victorine
affected
not
to
hear
setting
down
her
jug
she
came
close
to
the
window
and
said
respectfully
didst
thou
call
what
can
i
fetch
sir
willan
blaycke
leaned
both
his
arms
on
the
and
looking
into
the
eyes
of
victorine
dubois
replied
marry
girl
thou
hast
already
fetched
me
to
such
a
pass
that
thy
voice
rings
in
my
ears
i
asked
thee
if
it
were
thou
who
sang
retreating
from
the
window
a
step
or
two
victorine
said
sorrowfully
i
did
not
think
that
thou
hadst
the
face
of
one
who
would
jest
lightly
with
maidens
and
she
made
as
if
she
would
go
away
pardon
pardon
cried
willan
i
am
not
jesting
i
implore
thee
think
it
not
i
did
sleep
under
this
tree
before
supper
and
heard
such
singing
i
had
thought
it
a
bird
over
my
head
except
that
the
song
had
words
i
know
it
was
thou
be
not
angry
why
shouldst
thou
where
didst
thou
learn
those
wild
songs
from
sister
clarice
in
the
convent
answered
victorine
it
is
only
last
easter
that
my
grandfather
fetched
me
from
the
convent
to
live
with
him
and
my
aunt
jeanne
thy
aunt
jeanne
said
willan
slowly
is
she
thy
aunt
yes
said
victorine
sadly
she
that
was
thy
father
wife
whom
thou
wilt
not
have
in
thy
house
this
was
a
bold
stroke
on
victorine
part
to
tell
truth
she
had
had
no
idea
one
moment
before
of
saying
any
such
thing
but
a
sudden
emotion
of
resentment
got
the
better
of
her
and
the
words
were
uttered
before
she
knew
it
willan
was
angry
all
alike
he
thought
to
himself
a
bad
lot
i
dare
say
the
woman
has
set
the
girl
here
for
nothing
else
than
to
try
to
play
on
my
feelings
and
it
was
in
a
very
cold
tone
that
he
replied
to
victorine
thou
art
not
able
to
judge
of
such
matters
at
thy
age
thy
aunt
is
better
here
than
there
thou
knowest
he
added
in
a
gentler
tone
seeing
victorine
great
black
eyes
swimming
in
sudden
tears
that
she
was
never
as
mother
to
me
i
had
never
seen
her
till
i
returned
a
man
grown
victorine
was
sobbing
now
oh
she
cried
what
ill
luck
is
mine
i
have
angered
thee
and
my
aunt
did
especially
charge
me
that
i
was
to
treat
thee
well
she
doth
never
speak
an
ill
word
of
thee
sir
never
do
not
thou
charge
my
hasty
words
to
her
and
victorine
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
looked
up
in
willan
blaycke
face
with
a
look
which
she
had
had
good
reason
to
know
was
well
calculated
to
move
a
man
heart
willan
blaycke
had
led
a
singularly
pure
life
he
was
of
a
reticent
and
partly
phlegmatic
nature
though
he
looked
so
like
his
father
he
resembled
him
little
in
temperament
this
calmness
of
nature
added
to
a
pride
had
stood
him
in
stead
of
firmly
rooted
principles
of
virtue
and
had
carried
him
safe
through
all
the
temptations
of
his
unprotected
and
lonely
youth
he
had
the
air
and
bearing
and
had
had
in
most
things
the
experience
of
a
man
of
the
world
and
yet
he
was
as
ignorant
of
the
wily
ways
of
a
wily
woman
as
if
he
had
never
been
out
of
the
wilderness
victorine
tears
smote
on
him
poignantly
thou
poor
child
he
said
most
kindly
do
not
weep
thou
hast
done
no
harm
i
bear
no
ill
will
to
thine
aunt
and
never
did
and
if
i
had
thou
wouldst
have
disarmed
it
this
inn
seems
to
me
no
place
for
a
young
maiden
like
thee
victorine
glanced
cautiously
around
her
and
whispered
it
were
ungrateful
in
me
to
say
as
much
but
oh
sir
if
thou
didst
but
know
how
i
wish
myself
back
in
the
convent
i
like
not
the
ways
of
this
place
and
i
fear
so
much
the
men
who
are
often
here
when
thou
didst
speak
at
first
i
did
think
thou
wert
like
them
but
now
i
perceive
that
thou
art
quite
different
thou
seemest
to
me
like
the
men
of
whom
sister
clarice
did
tell
me
victorine
stopped
called
up
a
blush
to
her
cheeks
and
said
but
i
must
not
stay
talking
with
thee
my
aunt
will
be
looking
for
me
stay
said
willan
what
did
the
sister
clarice
tell
thee
of
men
i
thought
not
that
nuns
conversed
on
such
matters
oh
replied
victorine
innocently
it
was
different
with
the
sister
clarice
she
was
a
noble
lady
who
had
been
betrothed
and
her
betrothed
died
and
it
was
because
there
were
none
left
so
noble
and
so
good
as
he
she
said
that
she
had
taken
the
veil
and
would
die
in
the
convent
she
did
talk
to
me
whole
nights
about
this
young
lord
whom
she
was
to
have
wed
and
she
did
think
often
that
she
saw
his
face
look
down
through
the
roof
of
the
cell
clever
victorine
she
had
invented
this
tale
on
the
spur
of
the
instant
she
could
not
have
done
better
if
she
had
plotted
long
to
devise
a
method
of
flattering
willan
blaycke
it
is
strange
how
like
inspiration
are
the
impulses
of
artful
women
at
times
it
would
seem
wellnigh
certain
that
they
must
be
prompted
by
malicious
fiends
wishing
to
lure
men
on
to
destruction
in
the
surest
way
victorine
had
talked
with
willan
perhaps
five
minutes
in
that
space
of
time
she
had
persuaded
him
of
four
things
all
false
that
she
was
an
innocent
guileless
girl
that
she
had
been
seized
with
a
sudden
and
reverential
admiration
for
him
that
she
had
no
greater
desire
in
life
than
to
be
back
again
in
the
safe
shelter
of
the
convent
and
that
her
aunt
jeanne
had
never
said
an
of
him
victorine
victorine
called
a
sharp
loud
voice
the
voice
of
jeanne
who
would
have
bitten
her
tongue
out
rather
than
have
broken
in
on
this
interview
if
she
had
only
known
victorine
where
art
thou
loitering
oh
for
heaven
sake
sir
do
not
thou
tell
my
grandfather
that
i
have
talked
with
thee
cried
victorine
in
feigned
terror
here
i
am
aunt
i
will
be
there
in
one
second
she
cried
aloud
and
ran
hastily
down
the
storeroom
at
the
door
she
stopped
hesitated
turned
back
and
going
towards
the
window
said
wistfully
thou
hast
never
been
here
before
all
these
three
months
i
suppose
thou
travellest
this
way
very
seldom
the
full
moon
shone
on
victorine
face
as
she
said
this
her
expression
was
like
that
of
a
wistful
little
child
willan
blaycke
did
not
quite
know
what
he
was
doing
he
reached
his
hand
across
the
towards
victorine
she
did
not
extend
hers
i
will
come
again
sooner
he
said
wilt
thou
not
shake
hands
victorine
advanced
hesitated
advanced
again
it
was
inimitably
done
the
next
time
if
i
know
thee
better
i
might
dare
she
whispered
and
fled
like
a
deer
where
hast
thou
been
said
jeanne
angrily
the
supper
dishes
are
yet
all
to
victorine
danced
gayly
around
the
kitchen
floor
talking
with
the
son
of
thy
husband
she
said
he
seems
to
me
much
cleverer
than
a
magpie
jeanne
burst
out
laughing
thou
witch
she
said
secretly
well
pleased
but
where
didst
thou
fall
upon
him
thou
hast
not
been
in
the
nay
he
fell
upon
me
the
rather
replied
victorine
artlessly
as
i
was
resting
me
at
the
window
of
the
long
storeroom
he
heard
me
singing
and
came
there
did
he
praise
thy
voice
asked
jeanne
he
is
a
brave
singer
himself
is
he
said
victorine
eagerly
he
did
not
tell
me
that
he
said
my
voice
was
like
the
voice
of
a
wild
bird
and
there
be
birds
and
birds
again
i
was
minded
to
tell
him
and
not
all
birds
make
music
but
he
seemed
to
me
not
one
to
take
jests
readily
so
said
jeanne
that
he
is
not
leaves
he
early
in
the
morning
i
think
so
replied
victorine
he
did
not
tell
me
but
i
heard
the
elder
man
say
to
benoit
to
have
the
horses
ready
at
earliest
light
thou
must
serve
them
again
in
the
morning
said
jeanne
it
will
be
but
the
once
more
nay
answered
victorine
i
will
not
something
in
the
girl
tone
arrested
her
aunt
attention
and
why
she
said
sharply
looking
scrutinizingly
at
her
victorine
returned
the
gaze
with
one
as
steady
it
was
as
well
she
thought
that
there
should
be
an
understanding
between
her
aunt
and
herself
soon
as
late
because
he
will
come
again
the
sooner
aunt
jeanne
if
he
sees
me
no
more
after
and
victorine
gave
a
little
mocking
nod
with
her
head
turned
towards
the
dresser
piled
high
with
dishes
and
began
to
make
a
great
clatter
washing
them
jeanne
was
silent
she
did
not
know
how
to
take
this
victorine
glanced
up
at
her
mischievously
and
laughed
aloud
better
a
grape
for
me
than
two
figs
for
thee
dost
know
the
old
proverb
aunt
jeanne
thou
hadst
thy
figs
i
will
pluck
the
grape
bah
child
thou
talkest
wildly
said
jeanne
i
know
not
what
thou
at
but
she
did
know
very
well
only
she
did
not
choose
to
seem
to
understand
however
as
she
thought
matters
over
later
in
the
evening
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
one
thing
was
clear
to
her
and
that
was
that
it
would
probably
be
safe
to
trust
mademoiselle
victorine
to
row
her
own
boat
and
jeanne
said
as
much
to
her
father
when
he
inquired
of
her
how
matters
had
sped
in
spite
of
victorine
refusal
to
serve
at
the
breakfast
she
had
not
the
least
idea
of
letting
willan
go
away
in
the
morning
without
being
reminded
of
her
presence
she
was
up
before
light
dressed
in
a
pretty
pink
and
white
flowered
gown
which
set
off
her
black
hair
and
eyes
well
and
made
her
look
as
if
she
were
related
to
an
she
watched
and
listened
till
she
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
feet
in
the
courtyard
below
then
throwing
open
her
casement
she
leaned
out
and
began
to
water
her
flowers
on
the
stairway
roof
at
the
first
sound
willan
blaycke
looked
up
and
saw
her
it
was
as
pretty
a
picture
as
a
man
need
wish
to
see
and
willan
gazed
his
fill
at
it
the
window
was
so
high
up
in
the
air
that
the
girl
might
well
be
supposed
not
to
see
anything
which
was
going
on
in
the
courtyard
indeed
she
never
once
looked
that
way
but
went
on
daintily
watering
plant
after
plant
picking
off
dead
leaves
crumpling
them
up
in
her
fingers
and
throwing
them
down
as
if
she
were
alone
in
the
place
singing
too
softly
in
a
low
tone
snatches
of
a
song
the
words
of
which
went
floating
away
tantalizingly
over
willan
head
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
hear
it
was
a
great
tribute
to
victorine
powers
as
an
actress
that
it
never
once
crossed
willan
mind
that
she
could
possibly
know
he
was
looking
at
her
all
this
time
it
was
equally
a
token
of
another
man
estimate
of
her
that
when
old
benoit
hearing
the
singing
looked
up
and
saw
her
watering
her
flowers
at
this
unexampled
hour
he
said
under
his
breath
diable
and
then
glancing
at
the
face
of
willan
who
stood
gazing
up
at
the
window
utterly
unconscious
of
the
old
ostler
presence
said
diable
again
but
this
time
with
a
broad
and
amused
smile
iii
the
fountain
leaps
as
if
its
nearest
goal
were
sky
and
shines
as
if
its
life
were
light
no
crystal
prism
flashes
on
our
sight
such
radiant
splendor
of
the
rainbow
whole
of
color
who
would
dream
the
fountain
stole
its
tints
and
if
the
sun
no
more
were
bright
would
instant
fade
to
its
own
pallid
white
who
dream
that
never
higher
than
the
dole
of
its
own
source
its
stream
may
rise
thus
we
see
often
hearts
of
men
that
by
love
glow
are
sudden
lighted
lifted
till
they
show
all
semblances
of
true
nobility
the
passion
spent
they
tire
of
purity
and
sink
again
to
their
own
levels
low
the
next
time
willan
blaycke
came
to
the
golden
pear
he
did
not
see
victorine
this
was
by
no
device
of
hers
though
if
she
had
considered
beforehand
she
could
not
better
have
helped
on
the
impression
she
had
made
on
him
than
by
letting
him
go
away
disappointed
having
come
hoping
to
see
her
she
was
away
on
a
visit
at
the
home
of
pierre
gaspard
the
miller
whose
eldest
daughter
annette
was
victorine
one
friend
in
the
parish
there
was
an
eldest
son
also
pierre
second
on
whom
mademoiselle
victorine
had
cast
observant
glances
and
had
already
thought
to
herself
that
if
nothing
else
turned
up
but
there
was
time
enough
yet
not
so
thought
pierre
who
was
madly
in
love
with
victorine
and
was
so
put
about
by
her
cold
and
capricious
ways
with
him
that
he
was
fast
coming
to
be
good
for
nothing
in
the
mill
or
on
the
farm
but
he
is
of
no
consequence
in
this
account
of
the
career
of
mademoiselle
only
this
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
she
had
not
probably
been
away
from
the
golden
pear
on
the
occasion
of
willan
blaycke
second
visit
pierre
had
not
shown
himself
at
the
inn
for
some
weeks
and
victorine
was
uneasy
about
him
spite
of
her
plans
about
a
much
finer
bird
in
the
bush
she
was
by
no
means
minded
to
lose
the
bird
she
had
in
hand
she
was
too
a
young
lady
not
to
perceive
that
it
would
be
no
bad
thing
to
be
ultimately
mistress
gaspard
of
the
mill
no
bad
thing
if
she
could
not
do
better
of
which
she
was
as
yet
far
from
sure
so
she
had
inveigled
her
aunt
into
taking
the
notion
into
her
head
that
she
needed
change
and
the
two
had
ridden
over
to
gaspard
for
a
three
days
visit
the
very
day
before
willan
arrived
i
warrant
me
he
was
set
aback
when
i
did
tell
him
as
he
alighted
that
i
feared
me
he
would
not
be
well
served
just
at
present
as
there
was
no
woman
about
the
house
said
victor
chuckling
as
he
told
jeanne
the
story
he
did
give
a
little
start
not
so
little
but
that
i
saw
it
well
though
he
fetched
himself
up
with
his
pride
in
a
trice
and
said
loftily
have
no
doubt
all
will
be
sufficient
it
is
but
a
bite
of
supper
and
a
bed
that
i
require
i
must
go
on
at
daybreak
but
benoit
saw
him
all
the
evening
pacing
back
and
forth
under
the
and
many
times
looking
up
at
the
shut
casement
of
the
window
where
he
had
seen
victorine
standing
on
the
morning
when
he
was
last
here
did
he
ask
aught
about
her
said
jeanne
bah
said
victor
contemptuously
dost
take
him
for
a
fool
he
will
be
farther
gone
than
he
is
yet
ere
he
will
let
either
thee
or
me
see
that
the
girl
is
aught
to
him
i
wish
he
had
found
her
here
said
jeanne
it
was
an
ill
bit
of
luck
that
took
her
away
and
that
pierre
he
is
like
to
go
mad
about
her
since
these
three
days
under
one
roof
i
knew
not
he
was
so
daft
or
i
had
not
taken
her
there
she
were
well
wed
to
pierre
gaspard
said
victor
mated
with
own
degree
is
best
mated
after
all
what
shall
we
say
if
the
lad
come
asking
her
hand
he
will
not
ask
twice
i
can
tell
you
that
of
a
gaspard
trust
the
girl
to
keep
him
from
asking
till
she
be
ready
to
say
him
yea
or
nay
replied
jeanne
i
know
not
wherever
the
child
hath
learnt
such
ways
with
men
surely
in
the
convent
she
saw
none
but
priests
and
are
not
priests
men
sneered
victor
with
an
evil
laugh
faith
and
i
think
there
is
nought
which
other
men
teach
which
they
do
not
teach
better
fie
father
thou
shouldst
not
speak
ill
of
the
clergy
it
is
bad
luck
said
jeanne
jeanne
was
far
honester
of
nature
than
either
her
father
or
her
child
she
was
not
entirely
without
reverence
and
as
far
as
she
could
without
too
much
inconvenience
kept
good
faith
with
her
religion
when
victorine
heard
that
willan
blaycke
had
been
at
the
inn
in
their
absence
she
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
and
said
laughingly
eh
but
that
is
good
why
sayest
thou
so
replied
jeanne
i
say
it
is
and
i
say
it
is
good
retorted
victorine
and
not
another
word
could
jeanne
get
out
of
her
on
the
matter
victorine
was
right
as
willan
blaycke
rode
away
from
the
golden
pear
he
was
so
vexed
with
the
unexpected
disappointment
that
he
was
in
a
mood
fit
to
do
some
desperate
thing
he
had
tried
with
all
his
might
to
put
victorine
face
and
voice
and
sweet
little
form
out
of
his
thoughts
but
it
was
beyond
his
power
she
haunted
him
by
day
and
by
night
worse
by
night
than
by
day
for
he
dreamed
continually
of
standing
just
the
other
side
of
a
across
which
victorine
reached
snowy
little
hands
and
laid
them
in
his
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
grasp
them
the
vision
faded
and
he
waked
up
to
find
himself
alone
willan
blaycke
had
never
loved
any
woman
if
he
had
if
he
had
had
even
the
least
experience
in
the
way
of
passionate
fancies
he
could
have
rated
this
impression
which
victorine
had
produced
on
him
for
what
it
was
worth
and
no
more
and
taking
counsel
of
his
pride
have
waited
till
the
discomfort
of
it
should
have
passed
away
but
he
knew
no
better
than
to
suppose
that
because
it
was
so
keen
so
haunting
it
must
last
forever
he
was
almost
appalled
at
the
condition
in
which
he
found
himself
it
more
than
equalled
all
the
descriptions
which
he
had
read
of
unquenchable
love
he
could
not
eat
he
could
not
occupy
himself
with
any
affairs
all
business
was
tedious
to
him
and
all
society
irksome
he
lay
awake
long
hours
seeing
the
arch
black
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
and
piquant
little
mouth
worn
out
by
restlessness
he
slept
only
to
see
the
eyes
and
cheeks
and
mouth
more
vividly
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
that
he
reasoned
with
himself
that
he
asked
himself
sternly
a
hundred
times
a
day
wilt
thou
take
the
granddaughter
of
victor
dubois
to
be
the
mother
of
thy
children
is
it
not
enough
that
thy
father
disgraced
his
name
for
that
blood
wilt
thou
do
likewise
the
only
answer
which
came
to
all
these
questions
was
victorine
soft
whisper
oh
if
thou
didst
but
know
sir
how
i
wish
myself
safe
back
in
the
convent
and
thou
seemest
to
me
like
the
men
of
whom
sister
clarice
did
tell
me
poor
little
girl
he
said
she
is
of
their
blood
but
not
of
their
sort
her
mother
was
doubtless
a
good
and
pure
woman
even
though
she
had
not
good
birth
or
breeding
and
this
child
hath
had
good
training
from
the
sisters
in
the
convent
she
is
of
a
most
ladylike
bearing
and
has
a
fine
sense
of
all
which
is
proper
and
becoming
else
would
she
not
so
dislike
the
ways
of
an
inn
and
have
such
fear
of
the
men
that
gaze
on
her
there
so
touching
is
the
blindness
of
those
blinded
by
love
it
is
enough
to
make
one
weep
sometimes
to
see
it
to
see
as
in
this
instance
of
willan
blaycke
an
upright
modest
and
honest
gentleman
creating
out
of
the
very
virtues
of
his
own
nature
the
being
whom
he
will
worship
and
then
clothing
this
ideal
with
a
bit
of
common
clay
of
immodest
and
flesh
which
he
hath
found
to
his
hand
and
full
of
the
snare
of
good
looks
when
willan
blaycke
rode
away
this
time
from
the
golden
pear
he
was
as
we
say
in
a
mood
ready
to
do
some
desperate
thing
he
was
so
vexed
and
disappointed
what
he
did
do
proved
it
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
straight
for
gaspard
mill
the
artful
benoit
had
innocently
dropped
the
remark
as
he
was
holding
the
stirrup
for
willan
to
mount
that
mistress
jeanne
and
her
niece
were
at
pierre
gaspard
that
for
his
part
he
wished
them
back
there
was
no
luck
about
a
house
without
a
woman
in
it
willan
blaycke
made
some
indifferent
reply
as
if
all
that
were
nothing
to
him
and
galloped
off
but
before
he
had
gone
five
miles
leaven
worked
and
he
turned
into
a
lane
he
knew
which
led
to
the
mill
he
did
not
stop
to
ask
himself
what
he
should
do
there
he
simply
galloped
on
towards
victorine
it
was
only
a
couple
of
leagues
to
the
mill
and
its
old
tower
and
wheel
were
in
sight
before
he
thought
of
its
being
near
then
he
began
to
consider
what
errand
he
could
make
none
occurred
to
him
he
reined
his
horse
up
to
a
slow
walk
and
fell
into
a
reverie
so
deep
a
one
that
he
did
not
see
what
he
might
have
seen
had
he
looked
attentively
into
a
copse
of
poplars
on
a
high
bank
close
to
his
road
two
young
girls
sitting
on
the
ground
peeling
slender
willow
stems
for
baskets
it
was
annette
gaspard
and
victorine
and
at
the
sound
of
a
horse
feet
they
both
leaned
forward
and
looked
down
into
the
road
oh
see
victorine
annette
cried
a
brave
rider
goes
there
who
can
he
be
i
wonder
if
he
goes
to
the
mill
perhaps
my
father
will
keep
him
to
dinner
at
the
first
glance
victorine
recognized
willan
blaycke
but
she
gave
no
sign
to
her
friend
that
she
knew
him
he
sitteth
his
horse
like
one
asleep
she
said
or
in
a
dream
i
call
him
not
a
brave
rider
he
hath
forgotten
something
she
added
see
he
is
turning
about
and
with
keen
disappointment
the
girls
saw
the
horseman
wheel
suddenly
and
gallop
back
on
the
road
he
had
come
at
the
last
moment
by
a
mighty
effort
willan
had
wrenched
his
will
to
the
decision
that
he
would
not
seek
victorine
at
the
mill
and
this
was
why
when
her
aunt
told
her
that
he
had
been
at
the
inn
during
their
absence
victorine
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
with
so
pleased
a
laugh
eh
that
is
good
she
understood
by
a
lightning
intuition
all
which
had
happened
that
he
had
ridden
towards
the
mill
seeking
her
and
had
changed
his
mind
at
the
last
and
gone
away
but
she
kept
her
own
counsel
told
nobody
that
she
had
seen
him
and
said
in
her
mischievous
heart
he
will
be
back
before
long
and
so
he
was
but
not
even
victorine
with
all
her
confidence
in
the
strength
of
the
hold
she
had
so
suddenly
acquired
on
him
could
have
imagined
how
soon
and
with
what
purpose
he
would
return
on
the
evening
of
the
sixth
day
just
at
sunset
he
appeared
walking
with
his
on
his
shoulders
and
leading
his
horse
the
beast
limped
badly
and
had
evidently
got
a
sore
hurt
old
benoit
was
standing
in
the
arched
entrance
of
the
courtyard
as
they
approached
marry
but
that
beast
is
in
a
bad
way
he
exclaimed
and
went
to
meet
them
benoit
loved
a
horse
and
willan
blaycke
black
stallion
was
a
horse
to
which
any
man
heart
might
well
go
out
so
knowing
docile
proud
and
swift
was
the
creature
and
withal
most
beautifully
made
the
poor
thing
went
haltingly
enough
now
and
every
few
minutes
stopped
and
looked
around
piteously
into
his
master
face
and
the
man
doth
look
as
distressed
as
the
beast
thought
benoit
as
he
drew
near
it
is
a
good
man
that
so
loves
an
animal
and
benoit
warmed
toward
willan
as
he
saw
his
anxious
face
if
benoit
had
only
known
no
wonder
willan
face
was
it
was
he
himself
that
had
purposely
lamed
the
stallion
that
he
might
have
plain
and
reasonable
excuse
for
staying
at
the
golden
pear
some
days
he
had
not
meant
to
hurt
the
poor
creature
so
much
and
his
conscience
pricked
him
horribly
at
every
step
the
horse
took
he
patted
him
on
his
neck
spoke
kindly
to
him
and
did
all
in
his
power
to
atone
for
his
cruelty
that
all
was
very
little
however
for
each
step
was
torture
to
the
beast
his
fore
feet
were
nearly
bleeding
this
was
what
willan
had
done
the
day
before
he
had
taken
off
two
of
the
shoes
and
then
galloped
fast
over
miles
of
rough
and
stony
road
the
horse
had
borne
himself
gallantly
and
shown
no
fatigue
till
nightfall
when
he
suddenly
went
lame
and
had
grown
worse
in
the
night
so
that
willan
had
come
very
near
having
to
lie
by
at
an
inn
some
leagues
to
the
north
where
he
had
no
mind
to
stay
a
heavy
price
he
was
paying
for
the
delight
of
looking
on
victorine
face
he
began
to
think
as
he
toiled
along
on
foot
mile
after
mile
the
on
his
shoulders
and
the
hot
sun
beating
down
on
his
head
but
reach
the
golden
pear
that
day
he
would
and
he
did
almost
as
footsore
as
the
stallion
neither
master
nor
beast
was
wonted
to
rough
ways
my
horse
is
sadly
lame
willan
said
to
benoit
as
he
came
up
he
cast
two
shoes
yesterday
and
i
was
forced
to
ride
on
spite
of
it
for
there
was
no
blacksmith
on
the
road
i
came
i
fear
me
thou
canst
not
shoe
him
his
feet
have
grown
so
sore
no
nor
nor
the
day
after
cried
benoit
taking
up
the
inflamed
feet
and
looking
at
them
closely
it
was
a
sin
sir
to
ride
such
a
creature
unshod
he
is
a
noble
steed
nay
i
have
not
ridden
a
step
answered
willan
and
i
am
wellnigh
as
sore
as
he
we
have
come
all
the
way
from
the
north
boundary
a
matter
of
some
six
leagues
i
think
from
the
inn
of
jean
gauvois
but
he
is
a
farrier
himself
cried
benoit
how
let
he
the
beast
go
out
like
this
it
was
i
forbade
him
to
touch
the
horse
replied
the
wily
willan
he
did
lame
a
good
mare
for
me
once
driving
a
nail
into
the
quick
i
thought
the
horse
would
be
better
to
walk
this
far
and
get
thy
more
skilful
handling
there
is
not
a
man
in
this
country
they
tell
me
can
shoe
a
horse
so
well
as
thou
dost
thou
not
know
some
secret
of
healing
he
continued
by
which
thou
canst
harden
the
feet
so
that
they
will
be
fit
to
shoe
benoit
shook
his
head
thy
horse
hath
been
too
tenderly
reared
he
said
a
hurt
goes
harder
with
him
than
with
our
horses
but
i
will
do
my
best
sir
i
doubt
not
it
will
inconvenience
thee
much
to
wait
here
till
he
be
well
if
thou
couldst
content
thee
with
a
beast
sorry
to
look
at
but
like
the
wind
to
go
we
have
a
nag
would
carry
thee
along
and
thou
couldst
leave
the
stallion
till
thy
return
but
i
come
not
back
this
way
replied
willan
strangely
ready
with
his
lies
now
he
had
once
undertaken
the
rôle
of
a
manoeuvrer
i
go
far
south
even
down
to
the
harbors
of
the
sound
i
must
bide
the
time
now
he
hath
made
time
for
me
many
a
day
and
i
do
assure
you
good
benoit
i
love
him
as
if
he
were
my
brother
ay
replied
the
ostler
so
thought
i
when
i
saw
thee
bent
under
thy
and
leading
the
horse
by
the
rein
it
an
evil
man
likes
not
his
beast
we
say
in
normandy
sir
master
to
good
beast
serve
him
ill
at
every
feast
so
he
deserves
replied
willan
heartily
and
in
his
heart
he
added
i
hope
i
shall
not
get
my
deserts
benoit
led
the
poor
horse
away
toward
the
stables
and
willan
entered
the
house
no
one
was
to
be
seen
benoit
had
forgotten
to
tell
him
that
no
one
was
at
home
except
victorine
it
was
a
at
urban
and
victor
and
jeanne
had
gone
for
the
day
and
would
not
be
back
till
late
in
the
evening
willan
roamed
on
from
room
to
room
through
the
the
the
kitchen
all
were
empty
silent
as
he
retraced
his
steps
he
stopped
for
a
second
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
which
led
from
the
to
the
narrow
overhead
victorine
was
in
her
aunt
room
and
heard
the
steps
who
is
there
she
called
willan
recognized
her
voice
he
considered
a
second
what
he
should
reply
benoit
is
it
thou
victorine
called
again
impatiently
and
the
next
minute
she
bounded
down
the
stairway
crying
why
dost
thou
terrify
me
so
thou
bad
benoit
not
answering
me
when
i
she
stopped
face
to
face
with
willan
blaycke
and
gave
a
cry
of
honest
surprise
ah
but
is
it
really
thou
she
said
the
rosy
color
mounting
all
over
her
face
as
she
recollected
how
she
was
attired
she
had
been
asleep
all
the
warm
afternoon
and
had
on
only
a
white
petticoat
and
a
short
gown
of
figured
stuff
red
and
white
her
hair
was
falling
over
her
shoulders
willan
heart
gave
a
bound
as
he
looked
at
her
before
he
had
fairly
seen
her
she
had
turned
to
fly
yes
it
is
i
it
is
i
he
called
after
her
wilt
thou
not
come
back
nay
answered
victorine
from
the
upper
stair
that
i
may
not
do
for
the
house
is
alone
victorine
was
herself
now
and
was
wise
enough
not
to
go
quite
out
of
sight
she
looked
entrancing
between
the
dark
wooden
balustrades
one
slender
hand
holding
to
them
and
the
other
catching
up
part
of
her
hair
when
my
aunt
returns
if
she
bids
me
to
wait
at
supper
i
shall
see
thee
and
victorine
was
gone
then
sing
for
me
at
thy
window
entreated
willan
i
know
not
the
whole
of
any
song
cried
victorine
but
broke
as
she
said
it
into
a
snatch
of
a
carol
which
seemed
to
the
poor
infatuated
man
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
like
the
song
of
an
angel
he
hurried
out
and
threw
himself
down
under
the
where
he
had
lain
before
the
blossoms
had
all
fallen
from
the
now
and
through
the
thinned
branches
he
could
see
victorine
window
distinctly
she
could
see
him
also
it
would
be
no
hard
thing
to
love
such
a
man
as
he
methinks
she
said
to
herself
as
she
went
on
leisurely
weaving
the
thick
braids
of
her
hair
and
humming
a
song
just
low
enough
for
willan
to
half
hear
and
half
lose
the
words
once
in
a
hedge
a
bird
went
singing
singing
because
there
was
nobody
near
close
to
the
hedge
a
voice
came
crying
it
again
i
am
waiting
to
hear
sing
it
forever
is
sweet
to
hear
never
again
that
bird
went
singing
till
it
was
surer
that
no
one
was
near
long
in
that
hedge
there
was
somebody
waiting
crying
in
vain
am
waiting
to
hear
sing
it
again
it
was
sweet
to
hear
i
wonder
if
sister
clarice
lover
had
asked
her
to
sing
as
willan
blaycke
just
now
asked
me
that
she
did
make
this
song
thought
victorine
it
hath
a
marvellous
fitness
surely
and
she
repeated
the
last
three
lines
long
in
that
hedge
there
was
somebody
waiting
crying
in
vain
am
waiting
to
hear
sing
it
again
it
was
sweet
to
hear
but
i
should
be
silent
like
the
bird
and
not
sing
she
reflected
and
paused
for
a
while
willan
listened
patiently
for
a
few
moments
then
growing
impatient
he
picked
up
a
handful
of
turf
and
flung
it
up
at
the
window
victorine
laughed
to
herself
as
she
heard
it
but
did
not
sing
another
soft
thud
against
the
casement
no
reply
from
victorine
then
in
a
moment
more
in
a
rich
deep
voice
and
a
tune
far
sweeter
than
any
victorine
had
sung
came
these
words
faint
and
weary
toiled
a
pilgrim
faint
and
weary
of
his
load
sudden
came
a
sweet
bird
winging
glad
and
swift
across
his
road
songster
cried
the
pilgrim
is
now
the
load
i
bore
i
forget
it
in
thy
singing
hearing
thee
i
faint
no
more
while
he
spoke
the
bird
went
winging
higher
still
and
soared
away
songster
cried
the
pilgrim
songster
not
to
stay
was
the
songster
cruel
never
high
above
some
other
road
glad
and
swift
he
still
was
singing
lightening
other
pilgrims
load
victorine
bent
her
head
and
listened
intently
to
this
song
it
touched
the
best
side
of
her
nature
indeed
that
is
a
good
song
she
said
to
herself
but
it
fitteth
not
my
singing
i
make
choice
for
whom
i
sing
i
am
not
minded
so
to
give
pleasure
to
all
the
world
she
racked
her
brains
to
recall
some
song
which
would
be
as
pertinent
a
reply
to
willan
song
as
his
had
been
to
hers
but
she
could
think
of
none
she
was
vexed
for
the
romance
of
this
conversing
by
means
of
songs
pleased
her
mightily
at
last
half
in
earnest
and
half
in
fun
she
struck
boldly
into
a
measure
on
which
she
would
hardly
have
ventured
could
she
have
seen
the
serious
and
tender
expression
on
the
face
of
her
listener
under
the
as
willan
caught
line
after
line
of
the
rollicking
measure
his
countenance
changed
an
elfish
mood
is
upon
her
he
thought
she
doth
hold
herself
so
safe
in
her
chamber
that
she
may
venture
on
words
she
had
not
sung
nearer
at
hand
she
is
not
without
mischief
in
her
blood
no
doubt
and
own
look
began
to
grow
less
reverential
and
more
eager
as
he
listened
the
bee
is
a
fool
in
the
summer
he
knows
it
when
summer
is
flown
he
might
for
all
good
of
his
honey
as
well
have
let
flowers
alone
the
butterfly
he
is
the
wiser
he
uses
his
wings
when
they
grown
he
takes
his
delight
in
the
summer
and
dies
when
the
summer
is
done
a
heart
is
a
weight
in
the
bosom
a
heart
can
be
heavy
as
stone
oh
what
is
the
use
of
a
lover
a
maiden
is
better
alone
victorine
was
a
little
frightened
herself
as
she
sang
this
last
stanza
however
she
said
to
herself
i
will
bear
me
so
discreetly
at
supper
that
the
man
shall
doubt
his
very
ears
if
he
have
ever
heard
me
sing
such
words
or
not
it
is
well
to
perplex
a
man
the
more
he
be
perplexed
the
more
he
meditateth
on
thee
and
the
more
he
meditateth
on
thee
the
more
his
desire
will
grow
if
it
have
once
taken
root
a
very
wise
young
lady
in
her
generation
was
this
graduate
of
a
convent
where
no
men
save
priests
ever
came
just
as
victorine
had
sung
the
last
verse
of
her
song
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
voices
on
the
road
victor
and
jeanne
were
coming
home
willan
heard
the
sounds
also
and
slowly
arose
from
the
ground
and
sauntered
into
the
courtyard
he
had
an
instinct
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
be
seen
under
the
great
was
the
satisfaction
of
victor
and
jeanne
when
they
found
that
willan
blaycke
was
a
guest
in
the
inn
still
greater
when
they
learned
that
he
would
be
kept
there
for
at
least
two
days
by
the
lameness
of
his
horse
thou
not
make
great
haste
with
the
healing
of
the
beast
said
victor
to
benoit
it
might
be
a
good
turn
to
keep
the
man
here
for
a
space
and
the
master
exchanged
one
significant
glance
with
his
man
and
saw
that
he
need
say
no
more
there
was
no
such
specific
understanding
between
jeanne
and
victorine
from
some
perverse
and
roguish
impulse
the
girl
chose
to
take
no
counsel
in
this
game
she
had
begun
to
play
but
each
woman
knew
that
the
other
comprehended
the
situation
perfectly
when
victorine
came
into
the
to
serve
willan
supper
she
looked
to
his
eyes
prettier
than
ever
she
wore
the
same
white
gown
and
black
silk
apron
with
crimson
lace
she
had
worn
before
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
bright
from
the
excitement
of
the
serenading
and
in
which
she
had
been
engaged
her
whole
bearing
was
an
inimitable
blending
of
shyness
and
archness
tempered
by
almost
reverential
respect
willan
blaycke
would
have
been
either
more
or
less
than
mortal
man
if
he
had
resisted
it
he
did
not
he
succumbed
then
and
there
and
utterly
to
his
love
for
victorine
and
the
next
morning
when
breakfast
was
ready
he
electrified
victor
dubois
by
saying
with
a
not
wholly
successful
attempt
at
jocularity
look
you
your
man
tells
me
i
am
like
to
be
kept
here
a
matter
of
some
three
days
or
more
before
my
horse
be
fit
to
bear
me
now
it
irks
me
to
be
the
cause
of
so
much
trouble
seeing
that
i
am
the
only
traveller
in
the
house
i
pray
you
that
i
may
sit
down
with
you
all
at
as
is
your
wont
and
that
you
make
no
change
in
the
manner
of
your
living
by
reason
of
my
being
in
the
house
i
shall
be
better
pleased
so
there
was
about
as
much
command
as
request
in
willan
manner
and
after
some
pretended
hesitancy
victor
yielded
only
saying
by
way
of
breaking
down
the
last
barrier
my
daughter
hath
desired
not
to
see
thee
i
know
not
how
she
may
take
this
request
of
thine
it
seemeth
but
reasonable
unto
me
and
it
will
be
that
saving
of
work
for
her
i
think
she
may
consent
nothing
but
her
love
for
victorine
would
have
induced
jeanne
to
sit
again
at
meat
with
her
stepson
but
for
victorine
sake
jeanne
would
have
done
much
harder
things
and
indeed
after
the
first
few
moments
of
awkwardness
had
passed
by
she
found
that
she
was
much
less
uncomfortable
in
willan
presence
than
she
had
anticipated
willan
own
manner
did
much
to
bring
this
about
he
was
so
deeply
in
love
with
victorine
that
it
had
already
transformed
his
sentiments
on
most
points
and
on
none
more
than
in
regard
to
jeanne
he
thought
no
better
of
her
character
than
he
had
thought
before
but
he
found
himself
frequently
recollecting
as
he
had
never
done
before
or
at
least
had
never
done
in
a
kindly
way
that
after
all
she
had
been
his
wife
for
ten
years
and
it
would
perhaps
have
been
a
more
dignified
thing
in
him
to
have
attempted
to
make
her
continue
in
a
style
of
living
suitable
to
his
father
name
than
to
have
relegated
her
as
he
had
done
to
her
original
and
lower
social
station
jeanne
behavior
towards
him
was
very
judicious
affection
is
the
best
teacher
of
tact
in
many
an
emergency
in
life
we
see
it
every
day
among
ignorant
and
untaught
people
jeanne
knew
or
felt
without
knowing
that
the
less
she
appeared
to
be
conscious
of
anything
unusual
or
unpleasant
in
this
resumption
of
familiar
relations
on
the
surface
between
herself
and
willan
the
more
free
his
mind
would
be
to
occupy
itself
with
victorine
and
she
acted
accordingly
she
never
obtruded
herself
on
his
attention
she
never
betrayed
any
antagonism
toward
him
or
any
recollection
of
the
former
and
different
footing
on
which
they
had
lived
a
stranger
sitting
at
the
table
would
not
have
dreamed
from
anything
in
her
manner
to
him
that
she
had
ever
occupied
any
other
position
than
that
of
the
daughter
and
landlady
of
the
inn
a
observer
looking
on
at
affairs
in
the
golden
pear
for
the
next
three
days
would
have
seen
that
all
the
energies
of
both
victor
and
jeanne
were
bent
to
one
end
namely
leaving
the
coast
clear
for
willan
blaycke
to
fall
in
love
with
victorine
but
all
that
willan
thought
was
that
victor
and
his
daughter
were
far
quieter
and
modester
people
than
he
had
supposed
and
seemed
disposed
to
keep
themselves
to
themselves
in
a
most
proper
fashion
it
never
crossed
his
mind
that
there
was
anything
odd
in
his
finding
victorine
so
often
and
so
long
alone
in
the
in
the
uniform
disappearance
of
both
victor
and
jeanne
at
an
early
hour
in
the
evening
willan
was
too
much
in
love
to
wonder
at
or
disapprove
of
anything
which
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
talking
with
victorine
or
still
better
of
looking
at
her
what
he
liked
best
was
silently
to
watch
her
as
she
moved
about
doing
her
light
duties
in
her
own
graceful
way
he
was
not
a
voluble
lover
he
was
still
too
much
bewildered
at
his
own
condition
moreover
he
had
not
yet
shaken
himself
free
from
the
tormenting
disapproval
of
his
conscience
he
lost
sight
of
that
very
fast
however
as
the
days
sped
on
victorine
played
her
cards
most
admirably
she
did
not
betray
even
by
a
look
that
she
understood
that
he
loved
her
she
showed
towards
him
an
open
and
honest
admiration
and
an
eager
interest
in
all
that
he
said
or
did
an
almost
affectionate
too
in
serving
his
every
want
and
trying
to
make
the
time
of
his
detention
pass
pleasantly
to
him
it
must
be
a
sore
trial
sir
for
thee
to
be
kept
in
a
poor
place
like
this
so
many
days
benoit
says
that
he
thinks
not
thy
horse
can
go
safely
for
yet
some
days
she
said
to
willan
one
morning
would
it
amuse
thee
to
ride
over
to
pierre
gaspard
mill
if
thou
couldst
abide
the
gait
of
my
grandfather
nag
i
might
go
on
my
pony
and
show
thee
the
way
the
river
is
high
now
and
it
is
a
fair
sight
to
see
the
white
blossoms
along
the
banks
cunning
victorine
she
had
all
sorts
of
motives
in
this
proposition
she
thought
it
would
be
well
to
show
willan
blaycke
to
pierre
he
may
discover
that
there
are
other
men
beside
himself
in
the
world
she
mused
and
it
would
please
me
much
to
go
riding
up
to
the
door
for
annette
to
see
with
the
same
brave
rider
she
did
so
admire
and
there
are
many
ways
to
bring
a
man
near
one
in
riding
through
the
woods
all
these
and
many
more
similar
musings
lay
hid
behind
the
innocent
look
she
lifted
to
willan
face
as
she
suggested
the
ride
it
was
only
the
third
morning
of
willan
stay
at
the
inn
but
the
time
had
been
put
to
very
good
use
already
it
had
become
natural
to
him
to
come
and
go
with
victorine
to
stay
where
she
was
to
seek
her
if
she
were
missing
already
he
had
learned
the
way
up
the
outside
staircase
to
the
platform
where
she
kept
her
flowers
and
sometimes
sat
he
was
living
in
a
dream
going
the
way
of
all
men
blindfold
into
a
life
of
which
he
knew
and
could
know
nothing
indeed
and
that
is
what
i
should
like
best
of
all
things
he
replied
to
victorine
will
thy
aunt
let
thee
go
why
not
asked
victorine
opening
her
eyes
wide
in
astonishment
i
ride
all
over
the
parish
on
my
pony
alone
stupid
of
me
ejaculated
willan
inwardly
as
if
these
people
could
know
any
scruples
about
etiquette
these
people
as
willan
contemptuously
called
them
stood
at
the
door
of
the
inn
and
watched
him
riding
away
with
victorine
with
hardly
disguised
exultation
not
till
the
riders
were
fairly
out
of
sight
did
victor
venture
to
turn
his
face
toward
jeanne
then
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
he
clapped
jeanne
on
the
shoulder
and
said
we
see
thee
grandmother
of
thy
husband
grandchildren
yet
jeanne
ha
ha
jeanne
flushed
she
was
not
without
a
sense
of
shame
her
love
for
victorine
made
her
sensitive
to
the
stain
on
her
birth
thinkest
thou
it
could
ever
be
known
she
asked
anxiously
never
replied
her
father
never
is
as
safe
as
if
we
were
all
dead
and
for
that
the
living
are
safer
than
the
dead
if
there
be
tight
enough
lock
on
their
mouths
he
doth
seem
to
be
as
much
in
love
as
one
need
said
jeanne
ay
said
victor
more
than
ever
his
father
was
with
thee
canst
thou
not
let
that
alone
said
jeanne
angrily
surely
it
is
long
enough
gone
by
and
small
profit
came
of
it
not
so
not
so
daughter
replied
victor
soothingly
if
we
can
but
set
the
girl
in
thy
shoes
thou
didst
not
wear
thine
for
nought
even
though
they
pinched
thee
for
a
time
that
they
did
retorted
jeanne
it
gives
me
a
cramp
now
but
to
remember
them
willan
and
victorine
galloped
merrily
along
the
river
road
the
woods
were
sweet
with
spring
fragrances
great
thickets
of
dogwood
trees
were
white
with
flowers
mossy
hillocks
along
the
roadside
were
pink
with
the
dainty
bells
of
the
linnaea
the
road
was
little
more
than
a
path
and
curved
now
right
now
left
in
seeming
caprice
now
forded
a
stream
now
came
out
into
a
cleared
field
again
plunged
back
into
dense
groves
of
larch
and
pine
never
knew
i
that
the
woods
were
so
beautiful
thus
early
in
the
year
said
the
honest
willan
nor
i
till
said
the
artful
victorine
who
knew
well
enough
what
willan
did
not
know
himself
dost
thou
ride
here
alone
asked
willan
it
is
a
wild
place
for
thee
to
be
alone
if
i
came
not
alone
i
could
not
come
at
all
replied
victorine
sorrowfully
my
grandfather
is
too
busy
and
my
aunt
likes
not
to
ride
except
she
must
on
a
market
day
or
to
go
to
church
no
one
but
thou
hast
ever
walked
or
ridden
with
me
she
added
in
a
low
voice
sighing
and
now
after
two
days
or
three
thou
wilt
be
gone
willan
sighed
also
but
did
not
speak
the
words
i
will
always
ride
by
thy
side
victorine
were
on
his
lips
but
he
felt
himself
still
withheld
from
speaking
them
the
visit
at
the
mill
was
unsatisfactory
the
elder
gaspard
was
away
and
young
pierre
was
curt
and
surly
the
sight
of
victorine
riding
familiarly
and
with
an
evident
joyous
pride
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
country
and
a
young
man
at
that
and
a
young
man
moreover
who
looked
and
behaved
as
if
he
were
in
love
with
his
companion
how
could
the
poor
miller
be
expected
to
be
cordial
and
unconstrained
with
such
a
sight
before
his
eyes
annette
also
was
more
overawed
even
than
victorine
had
desired
she
should
be
by
the
sight
of
the
handsome
stranger
so
overawed
and
withal
perhaps
a
little
curious
that
she
was
dumb
and
awkward
and
as
for
gaspard
she
never
under
any
circumstances
had
a
word
to
say
so
the
visit
was
very
stupid
and
everybody
felt
ill
at
ease
especially
willan
who
had
lost
his
temper
in
the
beginning
at
a
speech
of
pierre
to
victorine
which
seemed
to
his
jealous
sense
too
familiar
i
thought
thou
never
wouldst
take
leave
he
said
to
victorine
as
they
rode
away
victorine
turned
towards
him
with
an
admirably
counterfeited
expression
of
surprise
oh
sir
she
said
i
did
think
i
ought
to
wait
for
thee
to
take
leave
i
was
dying
with
the
desire
i
had
to
be
back
in
the
woods
again
and
only
when
i
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
did
i
bethink
me
to
say
that
my
aunt
expected
us
back
to
dinner
long
they
lingered
on
the
on
their
way
home
even
the
plotting
brain
of
victorine
was
not
insensible
to
the
charm
of
the
sky
the
air
the
budding
foliage
and
the
myriads
of
blossoms
oh
sir
she
said
i
think
there
never
was
such
a
day
as
this
before
i
know
there
never
was
replied
willan
looking
at
her
with
an
expression
which
was
key
to
his
words
but
the
daughter
of
jeanne
dubois
was
not
to
be
wooed
by
any
vague
sentimentalisms
there
was
one
sentence
which
she
was
intently
waiting
to
hear
willan
blaycke
speak
anything
short
of
that
mademoiselle
victorine
was
too
innocent
to
comprehend
sweet
child
thought
willan
to
himself
she
doth
not
know
the
speech
of
lovers
i
mistrust
that
if
i
wooed
her
outright
she
would
be
afraid
it
was
long
past
noon
when
they
reached
the
golden
pear
dinner
had
waited
till
the
hungry
victor
and
jeanne
could
wait
no
longer
but
a
very
pretty
and
dainty
little
repast
was
ready
for
willan
and
victorine
as
she
sat
opposite
him
at
the
table
so
bright
and
beaming
her
whole
face
full
of
pleasure
willan
leaned
both
his
arms
on
the
table
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
some
minutes
victorine
he
said
victorine
started
she
was
honestly
very
hungry
and
had
been
so
absorbed
in
eating
her
dinner
she
had
not
noticed
willan
look
she
dropped
her
knife
and
sprang
up
what
is
it
sir
she
said
what
shall
i
fetch
her
instantaneous
resumption
of
the
relation
to
him
jarred
on
willan
at
that
second
indescribably
and
shut
down
like
a
floodgate
on
the
words
he
was
about
to
speak
nothing
nothing
said
he
i
was
only
going
to
say
that
thou
must
sleep
this
afternoon
thou
art
tired
nay
i
am
not
tired
said
victorine
petulantly
what
is
a
matter
of
six
leagues
of
a
morning
i
could
ride
it
again
between
this
and
sunset
and
not
be
tired
but
she
was
tired
and
she
did
sleep
though
she
had
not
meant
to
do
so
when
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
a
little
later
she
had
meant
only
to
rest
herself
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
in
a
fresh
toilette
return
to
willan
but
she
slept
on
and
on
until
after
sunset
and
willan
wandered
aimlessly
about
wondering
what
had
become
of
her
jeanne
saw
him
but
forebore
to
take
any
note
of
his
uneasiness
she
had
looked
in
upon
victorine
in
her
slumber
and
was
well
content
that
it
should
be
so
the
girl
will
awake
refreshed
and
rosy
thought
jeanne
and
it
will
do
no
harm
but
rather
good
if
he
have
missed
her
sorely
all
the
afternoon
supper
was
over
and
the
evening
work
all
done
when
victorine
waked
it
was
dusk
rubbing
her
eyes
she
sprang
up
and
went
to
the
window
jeanne
heard
her
steps
and
coming
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
called
thou
not
to
come
down
all
is
done
what
shall
i
bring
thee
to
eat
why
didst
thou
not
waken
me
replied
victorine
petulantly
i
meant
not
to
sleep
i
thought
the
sleep
was
better
replied
her
aunt
thou
didst
look
tired
and
it
suits
no
woman
looks
to
be
tired
victorine
was
silent
she
saw
willan
walking
up
and
down
under
the
she
leaned
out
of
her
window
and
moved
one
of
the
willan
looked
up
in
a
second
more
he
had
bounded
up
the
staircase
and
eagerly
said
art
thou
there
wilt
thou
never
come
down
victorine
was
uncertain
in
her
own
mind
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
next
so
she
replied
evasively
thou
wert
right
after
all
i
did
not
feel
myself
tired
but
i
have
slept
until
now
then
thou
art
surely
rested
canst
thou
not
come
and
walk
with
me
in
the
pear
orchard
said
willan
i
fear
me
i
may
not
do
that
after
nightfall
replied
victorine
my
aunt
would
be
angry
she
need
not
know
replied
the
eager
willan
thou
canst
come
down
by
this
stairway
and
it
is
already
near
dark
victorine
laughed
a
little
low
laugh
this
pleased
her
yes
she
said
i
have
often
come
down
by
that
post
from
my
window
but
truly
i
fear
i
ought
not
to
do
it
for
thee
what
should
i
say
to
my
aunt
if
she
missed
me
oh
she
thinks
thee
asleep
said
willan
she
told
me
at
supper
that
she
would
not
waken
thee
all
of
which
mistress
jeanne
heard
distinctly
standing
midway
on
the
wide
staircase
with
victorine
supper
of
bread
and
milk
in
her
hand
she
had
like
to
have
spilled
the
whole
bowlful
of
milk
for
laughing
but
she
stood
still
holding
her
breath
lest
victorine
should
hear
her
till
the
conversation
ceased
and
she
heard
victorine
moving
about
in
her
room
again
then
she
went
in
and
kissing
victorine
said
eat
thy
supper
now
and
go
to
bed
it
is
late
i
wake
thee
early
enough
in
the
morning
to
pay
for
not
having
called
thee
this
afternoon
then
jeanne
went
down
to
her
own
room
blew
out
her
candle
and
seated
herself
at
the
window
to
hear
what
would
happen
my
aunt
candle
is
out
she
hath
gone
to
bed
whispered
victorine
as
holding
willan
hand
she
stole
softly
down
the
outer
stair
i
do
doubt
much
that
i
am
doing
wrong
nay
nay
whispered
willan
thou
sweet
one
what
wrong
can
there
be
in
thy
walking
a
little
time
with
me
thy
aunt
did
let
thee
ride
with
me
all
the
day
and
he
tenderly
guided
victorine
steps
down
the
steep
stairs
pretty
well
pretty
well
laughed
mistress
jeanne
behind
her
casement
and
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
willan
and
victorine
steps
had
died
away
she
ran
downstairs
to
tell
victor
what
had
happened
victor
was
not
so
pleased
as
jeanne
he
did
not
share
her
confidence
in
character
sacre
he
said
what
wert
thou
thinking
of
dost
want
another
niece
to
be
fetched
up
in
a
convent
thou
mayst
thank
thyself
for
it
if
thou
art
grandmother
to
one
i
trust
no
man
out
of
sight
and
no
girl
the
man
in
love
with
the
girl
that
is
plain
but
he
means
no
marrying
that
thou
dost
not
know
retorted
jeanne
i
tell
thee
he
is
an
honorable
man
and
as
pure
as
if
he
were
but
just
now
weaned
i
know
him
and
thou
dost
not
he
will
marry
her
or
he
will
leave
her
alone
we
shall
see
muttered
the
coarse
old
man
as
he
walked
away
we
shall
see
like
mother
like
child
i
trust
them
not
and
in
a
thorough
victor
betook
himself
to
the
courtyard
what
he
heard
there
did
not
reassure
him
old
benoit
had
seen
willan
and
victorine
going
down
through
the
poplar
copse
toward
the
pear
orchard
and
may
the
saints
forsake
me
said
benoit
if
i
do
not
think
he
had
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
her
head
on
his
shoulder
thou
he
will
marry
her
nay
growled
victor
he
no
fool
that
jeanne
hath
set
her
heart
on
it
and
thinketh
it
will
come
about
but
not
so
i
he
seems
of
a
rare
and
honorable
speech
said
benoit
ay
ay
replied
victor
words
are
quick
said
and
fine
manners
come
easy
to
some
but
a
man
looks
where
he
weds
his
father
did
not
have
chance
for
much
looking
sneered
benoit
this
is
another
breed
even
if
his
father
begot
him
replied
victor
he
goeth
no
such
way
as
that
and
thoroughly
disquieted
victor
returned
to
the
house
to
report
to
jeanne
what
benoit
had
seen
she
was
still
undisturbed
thou
wilt
see
was
her
only
reply
and
the
two
sat
down
together
in
the
porch
to
await
the
lovers
return
hour
after
hour
passed
even
jeanne
began
to
grow
alarmed
it
was
long
after
midnight
i
fear
some
accident
hath
befallen
them
she
said
at
last
would
it
be
well
thinkest
thou
to
go
in
search
of
them
not
a
step
cried
victor
he
took
her
away
and
he
must
needs
bring
her
back
we
await
them
here
he
shall
see
whether
he
may
tamper
with
the
granddaughter
of
victor
dubois
hush
father
said
jeanne
here
they
come
walking
very
slowly
arm
in
arm
came
willan
and
victorine
they
had
evidently
no
purpose
of
entering
the
house
clandestinely
but
were
approaching
the
front
door
hoity
toity
muttered
victor
he
thinks
he
can
lord
it
over
us
surely
be
quiet
father
entreated
jeanne
her
quick
eye
saw
something
new
in
the
bearing
of
both
willan
and
victorine
but
victor
was
not
to
be
quieted
with
an
angry
oath
he
sprung
forward
from
the
porch
and
began
to
upbraid
willan
in
no
measured
tones
willan
lifted
his
right
hand
authoritatively
wait
he
said
do
not
say
what
thou
wilt
repent
victor
dubois
thy
granddaughter
hath
promised
to
be
my
wife
so
the
new
generation
avenged
the
old
and
willan
blaycke
in
the
prime
of
his
cultured
and
fastidious
manhood
fell
victim
to
a
spell
less
coarsely
woven
but
no
less
demoralizing
than
that
which
had
imbittered
the
last
years
of
his
father
life
footnote
the
inn
of
the
golden
pear
includes
three
chapters
of
a
longer
story
entitled
elspeth
pynevor
a
story
of
such
remarkable
vigor
and
promise
and
planned
on
such
noble
and
powerful
lines
as
to
deepen
regret
that
its
author
death
left
it
but
half
finished
a
single
sentence
has
been
added
by
another
hand
to
round
the
episode
of
willan
blaycke
infatuation
to
conclusion
the
mystery
of
wilhelm
rütter
it
was
long
past
dusk
of
an
august
evening
farmer
weitbreck
stood
leaning
on
the
big
gate
of
his
barnyard
looking
first
up
and
then
down
the
road
he
was
chewing
a
straw
and
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
deep
perplexity
these
were
troublous
times
in
lancaster
county
never
before
had
the
farmers
been
so
put
to
it
for
farm
service
had
come
and
instead
of
the
stream
of
laborers
seeking
employment
which
usually
at
this
season
set
in
as
regularly
as
river
freshets
in
spring
it
was
this
year
almost
impossible
to
hire
any
one
the
explanation
of
this
nobody
knew
or
could
divine
but
the
fact
was
indisputable
and
the
farmers
were
in
dismay
nobody
more
so
than
farmer
weitbreck
who
had
miles
of
in
grain
of
one
sort
and
another
all
yellow
and
nodding
and
ready
for
the
sickle
and
nobody
but
himself
and
his
son
john
to
swing
scythe
sickle
or
flail
on
the
place
never
i
am
caught
this
way
anoder
year
thought
he
as
he
gazed
wearily
up
and
down
the
dark
silent
road
but
that
does
to
me
no
goot
this
time
that
is
now
gustavus
weitbreck
had
lived
so
long
on
his
pennsylvania
farm
that
he
even
thought
in
english
instead
of
in
german
and
strangely
enough
in
english
much
less
broken
and
idiomatic
than
that
which
he
spoke
but
his
phraseology
was
the
only
thing
about
him
that
had
changed
in
modes
of
feeling
habits
of
life
he
was
the
same
he
had
been
forty
years
ago
when
he
farmed
a
little
plot
of
land
half
wheat
half
vineyard
in
the
mayence
meadows
in
the
fatherland
slow
methodical
saving
stupid
upright
obstinate
all
these
traits
old
weitbreck
as
he
was
called
all
through
the
country
possessed
to
a
degree
much
out
of
the
ordinary
and
it
was
a
combination
of
two
of
them
the
obstinacy
and
the
savingness
which
had
brought
him
into
his
present
predicament
in
june
he
had
had
a
good
laborer
one
of
the
best
known
and
eagerly
sought
by
every
farmer
in
the
county
a
man
who
had
never
yet
been
beaten
in
a
or
a
reaping
by
his
help
the
haying
had
been
done
in
not
much
more
than
two
thirds
the
usual
time
but
when
john
weitbreck
like
a
sensible
fellow
said
now
we
would
better
keep
alf
on
till
harvest
there
is
plenty
of
work
about
the
farm
he
can
help
at
and
we
wo
get
his
like
again
in
a
hurry
his
father
had
cried
out
mein
gott
it
is
that
you
tink
i
must
be
made
out
of
money
i
vill
not
keep
dis
man
on
so
big
wages
to
do
vat
you
call
vork
we
do
vork
ourself
there
was
no
discussion
of
the
point
john
weitbreck
knew
better
than
ever
to
waste
his
time
and
breath
or
temper
in
trying
to
change
a
purpose
of
his
father
or
convince
him
of
a
mistake
but
he
bided
his
time
and
he
would
not
have
been
human
if
he
had
not
now
taken
secret
satisfaction
seeing
his
father
anxiety
daily
increase
as
the
august
sun
grew
hotter
and
hotter
and
the
grain
rattled
in
the
husks
waiting
to
be
reaped
while
they
two
straining
their
arms
to
the
utmost
and
in
long
days
work
seemed
to
produce
small
impression
on
the
great
fields
the
women
shall
come
work
in
field
thought
the
old
man
as
he
continued
his
anxious
reverie
it
is
not
that
they
sit
idle
all
day
in
house
when
the
wheat
grows
to
rattle
like
the
peas
in
pod
they
can
help
the
mütter
and
carlen
that
will
be
much
help
they
can
do
and
hearing
john
steps
behind
him
the
old
man
turned
and
said
johan
dere
comes
yet
no
man
to
reap
must
go
in
the
field
carlen
and
the
mütter
it
must
the
wheat
get
fast
too
dry
it
is
more
as
two
men
can
do
john
bit
his
lips
he
was
aghast
never
had
he
seen
his
mother
and
sister
at
work
in
the
fields
john
had
been
born
in
america
and
he
was
american
not
german
in
his
feeling
about
this
without
due
consideration
he
answered
i
would
rather
work
day
and
night
father
than
see
my
mother
and
sister
in
the
fields
i
will
do
it
too
if
only
you
will
not
make
them
go
the
old
man
irritated
by
the
secret
knowledge
that
he
had
nobody
but
himself
to
blame
for
the
present
dilemma
still
more
irritated
also
by
this
proof
of
what
was
always
exceedingly
displeasing
to
him
his
having
adopted
american
standards
and
opinions
broke
out
furiously
with
a
wrath
wholly
disproportionate
to
the
occasion
you

john
walked
away
his
only
resource
when
his
father
was
in
a
passion
john
occupied
that
hardest
of
all
positions
the
position
of
a
mature
man
in
a
father
home
where
he
is
regarded
as
nothing
more
than
a
boy
as
he
entered
the
kitchen
and
saw
his
pretty
sister
carlen
at
the
high
walking
back
and
forth
drawing
the
fine
yarn
between
her
chubby
fingers
all
the
while
humming
a
low
song
to
which
the
whirring
of
the
wheel
made
harmonious
accompaniment
he
thought
to
himself
bitterly
work
indeed
as
if
they
did
not
work
now
longer
than
we
do
and
quite
as
hard
she
been
spinning
ever
since
daylight
i
believe
is
it
hard
work
spinning
liebchen
he
asked
carlen
turned
her
round
blue
eyes
on
him
with
astonishment
there
was
something
in
his
tone
that
smote
vaguely
on
her
consciousness
what
could
he
mean
asking
such
a
question
as
that
no
she
said
it
is
not
hard
exactly
but
when
you
do
it
very
long
it
does
make
the
arms
ache
holding
them
so
long
in
the
same
position
and
it
tires
one
to
stand
all
day
ay
said
john
that
is
the
way
it
tires
one
to
reap
my
back
is
near
broke
with
it
has
no
one
come
to
help
yet
she
said
no
said
john
angrily
and
that
is
what
i
told
father
when
he
let
alf
go
it
is
good
enough
for
him
for
being
so
stingy
and
but
the
brunt
of
it
comes
on
me
that
the
worst
of
it
i
do
see
what
got
all
the
men
there
have
always
been
plenty
round
every
year
till
now
alf
said
he
should
be
here
next
year
said
carlen
each
cheek
showing
a
little
signal
of
pink
as
she
spoke
but
it
was
a
dim
light
the
one
candle
gave
and
john
did
not
see
the
flush
he
was
going
to
the
west
to
farm
in
oregon
he
said
ay
that
it
replied
john
that
where
everybody
can
go
but
me
i
be
going
too
some
day
carlen
i
ca
stand
things
here
if
it
were
for
you
i
have
been
gone
long
ago
i
would
leave
mother
and
father
for
all
the
world
john
cried
carlen
warmly
and
i
do
think
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
what
would
father
do
with
the
farm
without
you
well
why
does
he
see
that
then
and
treat
me
as
a
man
ought
to
be
treated
exclaimed
john
he
thinks
i
no
older
than
when
he
used
to
beat
me
with
the
strap
i
think
fathers
and
mothers
are
always
that
way
said
the
gentle
cheery
carlen
with
a
low
laugh
the
mother
tells
me
each
time
how
to
wind
the
warp
as
she
did
when
i
was
little
and
she
will
always
look
into
the
churn
for
herself
i
think
it
is
the
way
we
are
made
we
will
do
the
same
when
we
are
old
john
and
our
children
will
be
wondering
at
us
john
laughed
this
was
always
the
way
with
carlen
she
could
put
a
man
in
good
humor
in
a
few
minutes
however
cross
he
felt
in
the
beginning
i
wo
then
he
exclaimed
i
know
i
wo
if
ever
i
have
a
son
grown
i
treat
him
like
a
son
grown
not
like
a
baby
may
i
be
there
to
see
said
carlen
merrily
and
you
remember
free
the
words
i
said
to
thee
hold
the
candle
here
for
me
will
you
that
a
good
boy
while
we
have
talked
my
yarn
has
tangled
as
they
stood
close
together
john
holding
the
candle
high
over
head
she
bending
over
the
tangled
yarn
the
kitchen
door
opened
suddenly
and
their
father
came
in
bringing
with
him
a
stranger
a
young
man
seemingly
about
years
of
age
tall
well
made
handsome
but
with
a
face
so
melancholy
that
both
john
and
carlen
felt
a
shiver
as
they
looked
upon
it
here
now
comes
de
hand
at
last
of
de
time
johan
cried
the
old
man
it
vill
be
that
all
can
vel
be
done
now
and
it
is
goot
that
he
is
from
mine
own
country
he
can
not
english
speak
many
vords
but
dat
is
nothing
he
can
vork
i
tolt
you
dere
vould
be
mans
come
john
looked
scrutinizingly
at
the
newcomer
the
man
eyes
fell
what
is
your
name
said
john
wilhelm
rütter
he
answered
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
country
ten
days
where
are
your
friends
i
haf
none
none
none
these
replies
were
given
in
a
tone
as
melancholy
as
the
expression
of
the
face
carlen
stood
still
her
wheel
arrested
the
yarn
between
her
thumb
and
ringer
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
stranger
face
a
thrill
of
unspeakable
pity
stirred
her
so
young
so
sad
thus
alone
in
the
world
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
fate
but
there
were
people
who
came
with
you
in
the
ship
said
john
there
is
some
one
who
knows
who
you
are
i
suppose
no
no
von
dat

replied
the
newcomer
haf
done
vid
too
much
questions
interrupted
farmer
weitbreck
i
haf
him
asked
all
he
stays
till
harvest
be
done
he
can
vork
it
is
to
be
easy
see
he
can
vork
john
did
not
like
the
appearance
of
things
too
much
mystery
here
he
thought
however
it
is
not
long
he
will
be
here
and
he
will
be
in
the
fields
all
the
time
there
can
not
be
much
danger
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
man
whom
no
human
being
knew
as
they
sat
at
supper
farmer
weitbreck
and
his
wife
plied
wilhelm
with
questions
about
their
old
friends
in
mayence
he
was
evidently
familiar
with
all
the
localities
and
names
which
they
mentioned
his
replies
however
were
given
as
far
as
possible
in
monosyllables
and
he
spoke
no
word
voluntarily
sitting
with
his
head
bent
slightly
forward
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
he
had
the
expression
of
one
lost
in
thoughts
of
the
gloomiest
kind
make
yourself
to
be
more
happy
mein
lad
said
the
farmer
as
he
bade
him
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
you
haf
come
to
house
vere
is
german
be
speaked
and
is
germany
in
hearts
dat
vill
be
to
you
as
friends
a
strange
look
of
even
keener
pain
passed
over
the
young
man
face
and
he
left
the
room
hastily
without
a
word
of
he
a
surly
brute
cried
john
nice
company
he
be
in
the
field
i
believe
i
sooner
have
nobody
i
think
he
has
seen
some
dreadful
trouble
said
carlen
i
wish
we
could
do
something
for
him
perhaps
his
friends
are
all
dead
i
think
that
must
be
it
do
you
think
so
mütter
frau
weitbreck
was
incarnate
silence
and
reticence
these
traits
were
native
in
her
and
had
been
intensified
to
an
abnormal
extent
by
thirty
years
of
life
with
a
husband
whose
temper
and
peculiarities
were
such
as
to
make
silence
and
reticence
the
sole
conditions
of
peace
and
comfort
to
so
great
a
degree
had
this
second
nature
of
the
good
frau
been
developed
that
she
herself
did
not
now
know
that
it
was
a
second
nature
therefore
it
stood
her
in
hand
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
originally
born
to
it
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
in
lancaster
county
a
more
placid
and
contented
wife
than
she
she
never
dreamed
that
her
custom
of
silent
acquiescence
in
all
that
gustavus
said
of
waiting
in
all
cases
small
and
great
for
his
decision
had
in
the
outset
been
born
of
radical
and
uncomfortable
disagreements
with
him
and
as
for
gustavus
himself
if
anybody
had
hinted
to
him
that
his
frau
could
think
or
ever
had
thought
any
word
or
deed
of
his
other
than
right
he
would
have
chuckled
complacently
at
that
person
blind
ignorance
of
the
truth
mein
frau
she
is
goot
he
said
goot
frau
goot
mütter
american

not

so
she

american
fraus
american
mans

but
in
regard
to
this
young
stranger
frau
weitbreck
seemed
strangely
stirred
from
her
usual
phlegmatic
silence
carlen
appeal
to
her
had
barely
been
spoken
when
rising
in
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
old
woman
said
solemnly
in
german
yes
liebchen
he
goes
with
the
eyes
like
eyes
of
a
man
that
saw
always
the
dead
it
must
be
as
you
say
that
all
whom
he
loves
are
in
the
grave
poor
boy
poor

it
is
now
that

must
be

mother
and

and

and

said
carlen
warmly
i
will
be
his
sister
and
i
not

brother
till
he
gets
a
civiller
tongue
in
his
head
said
john
it

interrupted
the
old

alvays

i
do

i
haf

yes
echoed
frau
weitbreck
we
do
not
know
it
was
not
so
easy
as
carlen
and
her
mother
had
thought
to
be
like
mother
and
sister
to
wilhelm
the
days
went
by
and
still
he
was
as
much
a
stranger
as
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
he
never
voluntarily
addressed
any
one
to
all
remarks
or
even
questions
he
replied
in
the
fewest
words
and
curtest
phrases
possible
a
smile
was
never
seen
on
his
face
he
sat
at
the
table
like
a
mute
at
a
funeral
ate
without
lifting
his
eyes
and
silently
rose
as
soon
as
his
own
meal
was
finished
he
had
soon
selected
his
favorite
seat
in
the
kitchen
it
was
on
the
side
of
the
big
fireplace
in
a
corner
here
he
sat
all
through
the
evenings
carving
out
of
cows
horns
or
wood
boxes
and
small
figures
such
as
are
made
by
the
peasants
in
the
german
tyrol
in
this
work
he
had
a
surprising
skill
what
he
did
with
the
carvings
when
finished
no
one
knew
one
night
john
said
to
him
i
do
not
see
wilhelm
how
you
can
have
so
steady
a
hand
after
holding
the
sickle
all
day
my
arm
aches
and
my
hand
trembles
so
that
i
can
but
just
carry
my
cup
to
my
lips
wilhelm
made
no
reply
but
held
his
right
hand
straight
out
at
length
with
the
delicate
figure
he
was
carving
poised
on
his
forefinger
it
stood
as
steady
as
on
the
firm
ground
carlen
looked
at
him
admiringly
it
is
good
to
be
so
she
said
you
must
be
strong
wilhelm
yes
he
said
i
haf
strong
and
went
on
carving
nothing
more
like
conversation
than
this
was
ever
drawn
from
him
yet
he
seemed
not
averse
to
seeing
people
he
never
left
the
kitchen
till
the
time
came
for
bed
but
when
that
came
he
slipped
away
silent
taking
no
part
in
the
general
unless
he
was
forced
to
do
so
sometimes
carlen
having
said
jokingly
to
john
now
i
will
make
wilhelm
say
succeeded
in
surprising
him
before
he
could
leave
the
room
but
often
even
when
she
had
thus
planned
he
contrived
to
evade
her
and
was
gone
before
she
knew
it
he
slept
in
a
small
chamber
in
the
barn
a
dreary
enough
little
place
but
he
seemed
to
find
it
all
sufficient
he
had
no
possessions
except
the
leather
pack
he
had
brought
on
his
back
this
lay
on
the
floor
unlocked
and
when
the
good
frau
weitbreck
persuading
herself
that
she
was
actuated
solely
by
a
righteous
motherly
interest
in
the
young
man
opened
it
she
found
nothing
whatever
there
except
a
few
garments
of
the
commonest
description
no
book
no
paper
no
name
on
any
article
it
would
not
appear
possible
that
a
man
of
so
decent
a
seeming
as
wilhelm
could
have
come
from
germany
to
america
with
so
few
personal
belongings
frau
weitbreck
felt
less
at
ease
in
her
mind
about
him
after
she
examined
this
pack
he
had
come
straight
from
the
ship
to
their
house
he
had
said
when
he
arrived
had
walked
on
day
after
day
going
he
knew
not
whither
asking
mile
by
mile
for
work
he
did
not
even
know
one
state
name
from
another
he
simply
chose
to
go
south
rather
than
north
always
south
he
said
why
he
did
not
know
he
was
indeed
strong
the
sickle
was
in
his
hand
a
plaything
so
that
he
seemed
to
be
doing
little
more
than
simply
striding
up
and
down
the
field
the
grain
falling
to
right
and
left
at
his
steps
from
sunrise
to
sunset
he
worked
tirelessly
the
famous
alf
had
never
done
so
much
in
a
day
farmer
weitbreck
chuckled
as
he
looked
on
vat
now
you
say
of
dat
alf
he
said
triumphantly
to
john
vork
he
as
dis
man
oh
but
he
make
swing
de
hook
john
assented
unqualifiedly
to
this
praise
of
wilhelm
strength
and
skill
but
nevertheless
he
shook
his
head
ay
ay
he
said
i
never
saw
his
equal
but
i
like
him
not
what
carries
he
in
his
heart
to
be
so
sour
he
is
like
a
man
bewitched
i
know
not
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
to
be
sold
to
the
devil
as
the
stories
say
but
if
there
be
on
my
word
i
think
wilhelm
has
made
some
such
bargain
a
man
could
not
look
worse
if
he
had
signed
himself
away
i
see
not
dat
he
haf
fear
in
his
face
replied
the
old
man
no
said
john
neither
do
i
see
fear
it
is
worse
than
fear
i
would
like
to
see
his
face
come
alive
with
a
fear
he
gives
me
cold
shivers
like
a
grave
underfoot
i
shall
be
glad
when
he
is
gone
farmer
weitbreck
laughed
he
and
his
son
were
likely
to
be
again
at
odds
on
the
subject
of
a
laborer
but
he
vill
not
go
i
haf
said
to
him
to
stay
till
christmas
maybe
always
john
surprise
was
unbounded
to
stay
till
christmas
he
cried
what
for
what
do
we
need
of
a
man
in
the
winter
it
is
not
dat
to
feed
him
is
much
and
all
dat
he
make
vid
de
knife
is
mine
it
is
home
he
vants
no
oder
ting
he
vork
not
for
money
father
said
john
earnestly
there
must
be
something
wrong
about
that
man
i
have
thought
so
from
the
first
why
should
he
work
for
nothing
but
his
board
a
great
strong
fellow
like
that
that
could
make
good
day
wages
anywhere
do
keep
him
after
the
harvest
is
over
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
him
den
you
can
turn
de
eyes
to
your
head
von
oder

retorted
his
father
i
find
him
goot
to
see
and
after
a
pause
so
do
carlen
john
started
good
heavens
father
he
exclaimed
oh
you
need
not
speak
by
de
heavens
mein
son
rejoined
the
old
man
in
a
taunting
tone
i
tink
i
can
mine
own
vay
vidout
you
to
be
help
i
was
not
yesterday
born
john
was
gone
flight
was
his
usual
refuge
when
he
felt
his
temper
becoming
too
much
for
him
but
now
his
steps
were
quickened
by
an
impulse
of
terrible
fear
between
him
and
his
sister
had
always
been
a
bond
closer
than
is
wont
to
link
brother
and
sister
only
one
year
apart
in
age
they
had
grown
up
together
in
an
intimacy
like
that
of
twins
from
their
cradles
till
now
they
had
had
their
sports
tastes
joys
sorrows
in
common
not
a
secret
from
each
other
since
they
could
remember
at
least
this
was
true
of
john
was
he
to
find
it
no
longer
true
of
carlen
he
would
know
and
that
right
speedily
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
he
thought
he
saw
his
father
scheme
if
carlen
were
to
wed
this
man
this
strong
and
tireless
worker
this
unknown
mysterious
worker
who
wanted
only
shelter
and
home
and
cared
not
for
money
what
an
invaluable
hand
would
be
gained
on
the
farm
john
groaned
as
he
thought
to
himself
how
little
anything
any
doubt
any
misgiving
perhaps
even
an
actual
danger
would
in
his
father
mind
outweigh
the
one
fact
that
the
man
did
not
vork
for
money
as
he
walked
toward
the
house
revolving
these
disquieting
conjectures
all
his
first
suspicion
and
antagonism
toward
wilhelm
revived
in
full
force
and
he
was
in
a
mood
well
calculated
to
distort
the
simplest
acts
when
he
suddenly
saw
sitting
in
the
square
stoop
at
the
door
the
two
persons
who
filled
his
thoughts
wilhelm
and
carlen
wilhelm
steadily
at
work
as
usual
at
his
carving
his
eyes
closely
fixed
on
it
his
figure
as
was
its
wont
rigidly
still
and
carlen
ah
it
was
an
unlucky
moment
john
had
taken
to
search
out
the
state
of
feeling
toward
wilhelm
carlen
sitting
in
a
posture
of
dreamy
reverie
one
hand
lying
idle
in
her
lap
holding
her
knitting
the
ball
rolling
away
unnoticed
on
the
ground
her
other
arm
thrown
carelessly
over
the
railing
of
the
stoop
her
eyes
fixed
on
wilhelm
bowed
head
john
stood
still
and
watched
her
watched
her
long
she
did
not
move
she
was
almost
as
rigidly
still
as
wilhelm
himself
her
eyes
did
not
leave
his
face
one
might
safely
sit
in
that
way
by
the
hour
and
gaze
undetected
at
wilhelm
he
rarely
looked
up
except
when
he
was
addressed
after
standing
thus
a
few
moments
john
turned
away
bitter
and
sick
at
heart
what
had
he
been
about
that
he
had
not
seen
this
he
the
loving
comrade
brother
to
be
slower
of
sight
than
the
hard
grasping
parent
i
will
ask
mother
he
thought
i
ca
ask
carlen
now
it
is
too
late
he
found
his
mother
in
the
kitchen
busy
getting
the
bountiful
supper
which
was
a
daily
ordinance
in
the
weitbreck
religion
to
sharpened
perceptions
the
fact
that
carlen
was
not
as
usual
helping
in
this
labor
loomed
up
into
significance
why
does
not
carlen
help
you
mütter
he
said
hastily
what
is
she
doing
there
idling
with
wilhelm
in
the
stoop
frau
weitbreck
smiled
it
is
not
alvays
to
vork
ven
one
is
young
she
said
i
haf
not
forget
and
she
nodded
her
head
meaningly
john
clenched
his
hands
where
had
he
been
who
had
blinded
him
how
had
all
this
come
about
so
soon
and
without
his
knowledge
were
his
father
and
his
mother
mad
he
thought
they
must
be
it
is
a
shame
for
that
wilhelm
to
so
much
as
put
his
eyes
on
face
he
cried
i
think
we
are
fools
what
know
we
about
him
i
doubt
him
in
and
out
i
wish
he
had
never
darkened
our
doors
frau
weitbreck
glanced
cautiously
at
the
open
door
she
was
frying
sweet
cakes
in
the
boiling
lard
forgetting
everything
in
her
fear
of
being
overheard
she
went
softly
with
the
dripping
skimmer
in
her
hand
across
the
kitchen
the
fat
falling
on
her
shining
floor
at
every
step
and
closed
the
door
then
she
came
close
to
her
son
and
said
in
a
whisper
the
fader
think
it
is
goot
at
john
angry
exclamation
she
raised
her
hand
in
warning
do
not
loud
spraken
she
whispered
carlen
will
hear
well
then
she
shall
hear
cried
john
half
beside
himself
it
is
high
time
she
did
hear
from
somebody
besides
you
and
father
i
reckon
i
got
something
to
say
about
this
thing
too
if
i
her
brother
by
no
tramp
like
that
is
going
to
marry
my
sister
without
i
know
more
about
him
and
before
the
terrified
old
woman
could
stop
him
he
had
gone
at
long
strides
across
the
kitchen
through
the
best
room
and
reached
the
stoop
saying
in
a
loud
tone
carlen
i
want
to
see
you
carlen
started
as
one
roused
from
sleep
seeing
her
ball
lying
at
a
distance
on
the
ground
she
ran
to
pick
it
up
and
with
scarlet
cheeks
and
uneasy
eyes
turned
to
her
brother
yes
john
she
said
i
am
coming
wilhelm
did
not
raise
his
eyes
or
betray
by
any
change
of
feature
that
he
had
heard
the
sound
or
perceived
the
motion
as
carlen
passed
him
her
eyes
involuntarily
rested
on
his
bowed
head
a
world
of
pity
perplexity
in
the
glance
john
saw
it
and
frowned
come
with
me
he
said
sternly
come
down
in
the
pasture
i
want
to
speak
to
you
carlen
looked
up
apprehensively
into
his
face
never
had
she
seen
there
so
stern
a
look
i
must
help
mütter
with
the
supper
she
said
hesitating
john
laughed
scornfully
you
were
helping
with
the
supper
i
suppose
sitting
out
with
yon
tramp
and
he
pointed
to
the
stoop
carlen
had
with
all
her
sunny
cheerfulness
a
vein
of
her
temper
her
face
hardened
and
her
blue
eyes
grew
darker
why
do
you
call
wilhelm
a
tramp
she
said
coldly
what
is
he
then
if
he
is
not
a
tramp
retorted
john
he
is
no
tramp
she
replied
still
more
doggedly
what
do
you
know
about
him
said
john
carlen
made
no
reply
her
silence
irritated
john
more
than
any
words
could
have
done
and
losing
losing
sight
of
prudence
he
poured
out
on
her
a
torrent
of
angry
accusation
and
scornful
reproach
she
stood
still
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
even
in
his
hot
wrath
john
noticed
this
unwonted
downcast
look
and
taunted
her
with
it
you
have
even
caught
his
miserable
hangdog
trick
of
not
looking
anybody
in
the
face
he
cried
look
up
now
look
me
in
the
eye
and
say
what
you
mean
by
all
this
thus
roughly
bidden
carlen
raised
her
blue
eyes
and
confronted
her
brother
with
a
look
hardly
less
angry
than
his
own
it
is
you
who
have
to
say
to
me
what
all
this
means
that
you
have
been
saying
she
cried
i
think
you
are
out
of
your
senses
i
do
not
know
what
has
happened
to
you
and
she
turned
to
walk
back
to
the
house
john
seized
her
shoulders
in
his
brawny
hands
and
whirled
her
round
till
she
faced
him
again
tell
me
the
truth
he
said
fiercely
do
you
love
this
wilhelm
carlen
opened
her
lips
to
reply
at
that
second
a
step
was
heard
and
looking
up
they
saw
wilhelm
himself
coming
toward
them
walking
at
his
usual
slow
pace
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
his
eyes
on
the
ground
great
waves
of
blushes
ran
in
tumultuous
flood
up
carlen
neck
cheeks
forehead
john
took
his
hands
from
her
shoulders
and
stepped
back
with
a
look
of
disgust
and
a
smothered
ejaculation
wilhelm
hearing
the
sound
looked
up
regarded
them
with
a
cold
unchanged
eye
and
turned
in
another
direction
the
color
deepened
on
carlen
face
in
a
hard
and
bitter
tone
she
said
pointing
with
a
swift
gesture
to
wilhelm
retreating
form
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
there
is
nothing
between
us
i
do
not
know
what
craze
has
got
into
your
head
and
she
walked
away
this
time
unchecked
by
her
brother
he
needed
no
further
replies
in
words
tokens
stronger
than
any
speech
had
answered
him
muttering
angrily
to
himself
he
went
on
down
to
the
pasture
after
the
cows
it
was
a
beautiful
field
more
like
new
england
than
pennsylvania
a
brook
ran
zigzagging
through
it
and
here
and
there
in
the
land
were
sharp
lifts
where
rocks
cropped
out
making
miniature
cliffs
overhanging
some
portions
of
the
gray
lichens
and
green
mosses
grew
on
these
rocks
and
belts
of
wild
flag
and
sedges
surrounded
their
base
the
cows
in
a
warm
day
used
to
stand
there
in
shade
of
the
rocks
it
was
a
favorite
place
of
wilhelm
he
sometimes
lay
on
the
top
of
one
of
these
rocks
the
greater
part
of
the
night
looking
down
into
the
gliding
water
or
up
into
the
sky
carlen
from
her
window
had
more
than
once
seen
him
thus
and
passionately
longed
to
go
down
and
comfort
his
lonely
sorrow
it
was
indeed
true
as
she
had
said
to
her
brother
that
there
was
nothing
between
her
and
wilhelm
never
a
word
had
passed
never
a
look
or
tone
to
betray
that
he
knew
whether
she
were
fair
or
not
whether
she
lived
or
not
she
came
and
went
in
his
presence
as
did
all
others
with
no
more
apparent
relation
to
the
currents
of
his
strange
veiled
existence
than
if
they
or
he
belonged
to
a
phantom
world
but
it
was
also
true
that
never
since
the
first
day
of
his
mysterious
coming
had
wilhelm
been
long
absent
from
carlen
thoughts
and
she
did
indeed
find
him
as
her
father
keen
eyes
sharpened
by
greed
had
observed
good
to
look
upon
that
most
insidious
of
love
allies
pity
had
stormed
the
fortress
of
carlen
heart
and
carried
it
by
a
single
charge
what
could
a
girl
give
do
or
be
that
would
be
too
much
for
one
so
stricken
so
lonely
as
was
wilhelm
the
melancholy
beauty
of
his
face
his
lithe
figure
his
great
strength
all
combined
to
heighten
this
impression
and
to
fan
the
flames
of
the
passion
in
carlen
virgin
soul
it
was
indeed
as
john
had
sorrowfully
said
to
himself
too
late
to
speak
to
carlen
as
john
stood
now
at
the
pasture
bars
waiting
for
the
herd
of
cows
slow
winding
up
the
slope
from
the
brook
he
saw
wilhelm
on
the
rocks
below
he
had
thrown
himself
down
on
his
back
and
lay
there
with
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
presently
he
clasped
both
hands
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
a
sight
that
he
could
no
longer
bear
something
akin
to
pity
stirred
even
in
john
angry
heart
as
he
watched
him
what
can
it
be
he
said
that
makes
him
hate
even
the
sky
it
may
be
it
is
a
sweetheart
he
has
lost
and
he
is
one
of
that
strange
kind
of
men
who
can
love
but
once
and
it
is
loving
the
dead
that
makes
him
so
like
one
dead
himself
poor
carlen
i
think
myself
he
never
so
much
as
sees
her
a
strange
reverie
surely
for
the
brother
who
had
so
few
short
moments
ago
been
angrily
reproaching
his
sister
for
the
disgrace
and
shame
of
caring
for
this
tramp
but
the
pity
was
in
john
bosom
his
inborn
distrust
and
antagonism
to
the
man
were
too
strong
for
any
gentler
sentiment
toward
him
to
live
long
by
their
side
and
when
the
family
gathered
at
the
he
fixed
upon
wilhelm
so
suspicious
and
hostile
a
gaze
that
even
wilhelm
absent
mind
perceived
it
and
he
in
turn
looked
inquiringly
at
john
a
sudden
bewilderment
apparent
in
his
manner
it
disappeared
however
almost
immediately
dying
away
in
his
usual
melancholy
absorption
it
had
produced
scarce
a
ripple
on
the
monotonous
surface
of
his
habitual
gloom
but
carlen
had
perceived
all
both
the
look
on
john
face
and
the
bewilderment
on
wilhelm
and
it
roused
in
her
a
resentment
so
fierce
toward
john
she
could
not
forbear
showing
it
how
cruel
she
thought
as
if
the
poor
fellow
had
not
all
he
could
bear
already
without
being
treated
unkindly
by
us
and
she
redoubled
her
efforts
to
win
wilhelm
attention
and
divert
his
thoughts
all
in
vain
kindness
and
unkindness
glanced
off
alike
powerless
from
the
veil
in
which
he
was
wrapped
john
sat
by
with
roused
attention
and
sharpened
perception
noting
all
had
it
been
all
along
like
this
where
had
his
eyes
been
for
the
past
month
had
he
too
been
under
a
spell
it
looked
like
it
he
groaned
in
spirit
as
he
sat
silently
playing
with
his
food
not
eating
and
when
his
father
said
why
haf
you
not
appetite
johan
he
rose
abruptly
pushed
back
his
chair
and
leaving
the
table
without
a
word
went
out
and
down
again
into
the
pasture
where
the
dewy
grass
and
the
quivering
stars
in
the
brook
shimmered
in
the
pale
light
of
a
young
moon
to
john
also
the
mossy
rocks
in
this
pasture
were
a
favorite
spot
for
rest
and
meditation
since
the
days
when
he
and
carlen
had
fished
from
their
edges
with
bent
pins
and
yarn
for
minnows
he
had
loved
the
place
they
had
spent
happy
hours
enough
there
to
count
up
into
days
and
not
the
least
among
the
innumerable
annoyances
and
irritations
of
which
he
had
been
anxious
in
regard
to
wilhelm
was
the
fact
that
he
too
had
perceived
the
charm
of
the
field
and
chosen
it
for
his
own
melancholy
retreat
as
he
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
rocks
he
saw
a
figure
gliding
swiftly
down
the
hill
it
was
carlen
as
she
drew
near
he
looked
at
her
without
speaking
but
the
loving
girl
was
not
repelled
springing
lightly
to
the
rock
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissing
him
said
i
saw
you
coming
down
here
john
and
i
ran
after
you
do
not
be
angry
with
me
brother
it
breaks
my
heart
a
sudden
revulsion
of
shame
for
his
unjust
suspicion
filled
john
with
tenderness
mein
schwester
he
said
fondly
they
had
always
the
habit
of
using
the
german
tongue
for
fond
epithets
mein
schwester
klein
i
love
you
so
much
i
can
not
help
being
wretched
when
i
see
you
in
danger
but
i
am
not
angry
nestling
herself
close
by
his
side
carlen
looked
over
into
the
water
this
is
the
very
rock
i
fell
off
of
that
day
do
you
remember
she
said
and
how
wet
you
got
fishing
me
out
and
oh
what
an
awful
beating
father
gave
you
and
i
always
thought
it
was
wicked
for
if
you
had
not
pulled
me
out
i
should
have
drowned
it
was
for
letting
you
fall
in
he
beat
me
laughed
john
and
they
both
grew
tender
and
merry
recalling
the
babyhood
times
how
long
long
ago
cried
carlen
it
seems
only
a
day
said
john
i
think
time
goes
faster
for
a
man
than
for
a
woman
sighed
carlen
it
is
a
shorter
day
in
the
fields
than
in
the
house
are
you
not
content
my
sister
said
john
carlen
was
silent
you
have
always
seemed
so
he
said
reproachfully
it
is
always
the
same
john
she
murmured
each
day
like
every
other
day
i
would
like
it
to
be
some
days
different
john
sighed
he
knew
of
what
this
new
unrest
was
born
he
longed
to
begin
to
speak
of
wilhelm
and
yet
he
knew
not
how
now
that
after
longer
reflection
he
had
become
sure
in
his
own
mind
that
wilhelm
cared
nothing
for
his
sister
he
felt
an
instinctive
shrinking
from
recognizing
to
himself
or
letting
it
be
recognized
between
them
that
she
unwooed
had
learned
to
love
his
heart
ached
with
dread
of
the
suffering
which
might
be
in
store
for
her
carlen
herself
cut
the
gordian
knot
brother
she
whispered
why
do
you
think
wilhelm
is
not
good
i
said
not
that
carlen
he
replied
evasively
i
only
say
we
know
nothing
and
it
is
dangerous
to
trust
where
one
knows
nothing
it
would
not
be
trust
if
we
knew
answered
the
loyal
girl
i
believe
he
is
good
but
john
john
what
misery
in
his
eyes
saw
you
ever
anything
like
it
no
he
replied
never
has
he
never
told
you
anything
about
himself
carlen
once
she
answered
i
took
courage
to
ask
him
if
he
had
relatives
in
germany
and
he
said
no
and
i
exclaimed
then
all
dead
dead
he
answered
in
such
a
voice
i
hardly
dared
speak
again
but
i
did
i
said
one
might
have
the
terrible
sorrow
to
lose
all
relatives
it
needs
only
that
three
should
die
my
father
and
mother
and
my
brother
only
three
and
two
are
already
old
and
i
should
have
no
relatives
myself
but
if
one
is
left
without
relatives
there
are
always
friends
thank
god
and
he
looked
at
me
he
never
looks
at
one
you
know
but
he
looked
at
me
then
as
if
i
had
done
a
sin
to
speak
the
word
and
he
said
have
no
friends
they
are
all
dead
too
and
then
went
away
oh
brother
why
can
not
we
win
him
out
of
this
grief
we
can
be
good
friends
to
him
can
you
not
find
out
for
me
what
it
is
it
was
a
cruel
weapon
to
use
but
on
the
instant
john
made
up
his
mind
to
use
it
it
might
spare
carlen
grief
in
the
end
i
have
thought
he
said
that
it
might
be
for
a
dead
sweetheart
he
mourned
thus
there
are
men
you
know
who
love
that
way
and
never
smile
again
john
to
have
dreamed
that
he
could
forestall
any
conjecture
in
the
girl
heart
i
have
thought
of
that
she
answered
meekly
it
would
seem
as
if
it
could
be
nothing
else
but
john
if
she
be
really
dead
carlen
did
not
finish
the
sentence
it
was
not
necessary
after
a
silence
she
spoke
again
dear
john
if
you
could
be
more
friendly
with
him
i
think
it
might
be
different
he
is
your
age
father
and
mother
are
too
old
and
to
me
he
will
not
speak
she
sighed
deeply
as
she
spoke
these
last
words
and
went
on
of
course
if
it
is
for
a
dead
sweetheart
that
he
is
grieving
thus
it
is
only
natural
that
the
sight
of
women
should
be
to
him
worse
than
the
sight
of
men
but
it
is
very
seldom
john
that
a
man
will
mourn
his
whole
life
for
a
sweetheart
is
it
not
john
why
men
marry
again
almost
always
even
when
it
is
a
wife
that
they
have
lost
and
a
sweetheart
is
not
so
much
as
a
wife
i
have
heard
said
the
pitiless
john
that
a
man
is
quicker
healed
of
grief
for
a
wife
than
for
one
he
had
thought
to
wed
but
lost
you
are
a
man
said
carlen
you
can
tell
if
that
would
be
true
no
i
can
not
he
answered
for
i
have
loved
no
woman
but
you
my
sister
and
on
my
word
i
think
i
will
be
in
no
haste
to
either
it
brings
misery
it
seems
to
me
if
carlen
had
spoken
her
thought
at
these
words
she
would
have
said
yes
it
brings
misery
but
even
so
it
is
better
than
joy
but
carlen
was
ashamed
afraid
also
she
had
passed
now
into
a
new
life
whither
her
brother
she
perceived
could
not
follow
she
could
barely
reach
his
hand
across
the
boundary
line
which
parted
them
i
hope
you
will
love
some
one
john
she
said
you
would
be
happy
with
a
wife
you
are
old
enough
to
have
a
home
of
your
own
only
a
year
older
than
you
my
sister
he
rejoined
i
too
am
old
enough
to
have
a
home
of
my
own
she
said
with
a
gentle
dignity
of
tone
which
more
impressed
john
with
a
sense
of
the
change
in
carlen
than
all
else
which
had
been
said
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
house
as
he
had
done
when
he
was
ten
and
she
nine
john
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steepest
rock
with
upstretched
arms
by
the
help
of
which
carlen
leaped
lightly
down
we
are
not
children
any
more
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
more
the
pity
said
john
half
lightly
half
sadly
as
they
went
on
hand
in
hand
when
they
reached
the
bars
carlen
paused
withdrawing
her
hand
from
john
and
laying
it
on
his
shoulder
she
said
brother
will
you
not
try
to
find
out
what
is
wilhelm
grief
can
you
not
try
to
be
friends
with
him
john
made
no
answer
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
promise
for
my
sake
brother
said
the
girl
i
have
spoken
to
no
one
else
but
you
i
would
die
before
any
one
else
should
know
even
my
mother
john
could
not
resist
this
yes
he
said
i
will
try
it
will
be
hard
but
i
will
try
my
best
carlen
i
will
have
a
talk
with
wilhelm
and
the
brother
and
sister
parted
he
only
the
sadder
she
far
happier
for
their
talk
she
thought
i
will
know
oh
and
she
fell
asleep
more
peacefully
than
had
been
her
wont
for
many
nights
on
the
morrow
it
chanced
that
john
and
wilhelm
went
separate
ways
to
work
and
did
not
meet
until
noon
in
the
afternoon
wilhelm
was
sent
on
an
errand
to
a
farm
some
five
miles
away
and
thus
the
day
passed
without
john
having
found
any
opportunity
for
the
promised
talk
carlen
perceived
with
keen
disappointment
this
frustration
of
his
purpose
but
comforted
herself
thinking
with
the
swift
forerunning
trust
of
youth
he
will
surely
get
a
chance
he
will
have
something
to
tell
me
when
wilhelm
returned
from
this
errand
he
came
singing
up
the
road
carlen
heard
the
voice
and
looked
out
of
the
window
in
amazement
never
before
had
a
note
of
singing
been
heard
from
wilhelm
voice
she
could
not
believe
her
ears
neither
her
eyes
when
she
saw
him
walking
swiftly
almost
running
erect
his
head
held
straight
his
eyes
gazing
free
and
confident
before
him
what
had
happened
what
could
have
happened
now
for
the
first
time
carlen
saw
the
full
beauty
of
his
face
it
wore
an
exultant
look
as
of
one
set
free
triumphant
he
leaped
lightly
over
the
bars
he
stooped
and
fondled
the
dog
speaking
to
him
in
a
merry
tone
then
he
whistled
then
broke
again
into
singing
a
gay
german
song
carlen
was
stupefied
with
wonder
who
was
this
new
man
in
the
body
of
wilhelm
where
had
disappeared
the
man
of
figure
bent
head
downcast
eyes
face
whom
until
that
hour
she
had
known
carlen
clasped
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
bewilderment
if
he
has
found
his
sweetheart
i
shall
die
she
thought
how
could
it
be
a
letter
perhaps
a
message
she
dreaded
to
see
him
she
lingered
in
her
room
till
it
was
past
the
supper
hour
dreading
what
she
knew
not
yet
knew
when
she
went
down
the
four
were
seated
at
supper
as
she
opened
the
door
roars
of
laughter
greeted
her
and
the
first
sight
she
saw
was
wilhelm
face
full
of
vivacity
excitement
he
was
telling
a
jesting
story
at
which
even
her
mother
was
heartily
laughing
her
father
had
laughed
till
the
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
john
was
holding
his
sides
wilhelm
was
a
mimic
it
appeared
he
was
imitating
the
ridiculous
speech
gait
gestures
of
a
man
he
had
seen
in
the
village
that
afternoon
i
sent
you
to
village
sooner
as
dis
if
i
haf
known
vat
you
are
like
ven
you
come
back
said
farmer
weitbreck
wiping
his
eyes
and
john
echoed
his
father
upon
my
word
wilhelm
you
are
a
good
actor
why
have
you
kept
your
light
under
a
bushel
so
long
and
john
looked
at
him
with
a
new
interest
and
liking
if
this
were
the
true
wilhelm
he
might
welcome
him
indeed
as
a
brother
carlen
alone
looked
grave
anxious
unhappy
she
could
not
laugh
tale
after
tale
jest
after
jest
fell
from
wilhelm
lips
such
a
never
before
sat
at
the
weitbreck
board
the
old
kitchen
never
echoed
with
such
laughter
finally
john
exclaimed
man
alive
where
have
you
kept
yourself
all
this
time
have
you
been
ill
till
now
that
you
hid
your
tongue
what
has
cured
you
in
a
day
wilhelm
laughed
a
laugh
so
ringing
it
made
him
seem
like
a
boy
yes
i
have
been
ill
till
he
said
and
now
i
am
well
and
he
rattled
on
again
with
his
merry
talk
carlen
grew
cold
with
fear
surely
this
meant
but
one
thing
nothing
else
nothing
less
could
have
thus
in
an
hour
rolled
away
the
burden
of
his
sadness
later
in
the
evening
she
said
timidly
did
you
hear
any
news
in
the
village
this
afternoon
wilhelm
no
no
news
he
said
i
had
heard
no
news
as
he
said
this
a
strange
look
flitted
swiftly
across
his
face
and
was
gone
before
any
eye
but
a
loving
woman
had
noted
it
it
did
not
escape
carlen
and
she
fell
into
a
reverie
of
wondering
what
possible
double
meaning
could
have
underlain
his
words
did
you
know
dietman
in
germany
she
asked
this
was
the
name
of
the
farmer
to
whose
house
he
had
been
sent
on
an
errand
they
were
into
the
town
since
spring
no
replied
wilhelm
with
another
strange
sharp
glance
at
carlen
i
saw
him
not
before
have
they
children
she
continued
are
they
old
no
young
he
answered
they
haf
one
child
little
baby
carlen
could
not
contrive
any
other
questions
to
ask
it
must
have
been
a
letter
she
thought
and
her
face
grew
sadder
it
was
a
late
bedtime
when
the
family
parted
for
the
night
the
astonishing
change
in
wilhelm
manner
was
now
even
more
apparent
than
it
had
yet
been
instead
of
slipping
off
as
was
his
usual
habit
without
exchanging
a
with
any
one
he
insisted
on
shaking
hands
with
each
still
talking
and
laughing
with
gay
and
affectionate
words
and
repeating
over
and
again
farmer
weitbreck
was
carried
out
of
himself
with
pleasure
at
all
this
and
holding
wilhelm
hand
fast
in
his
shaking
it
heartily
and
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
he
exclaimed
in
fatherly
familiarity
dis
is
goot
mein
son
dis
is
goot
now
are
you
von
of
us
and
he
glanced
meaningly
at
john
who
smiled
back
in
secret
intelligence
as
he
did
so
there
went
like
a
flash
through
his
mind
the
question
can
carlen
have
spoken
with
him
can
that
be
it
but
a
look
at
carlen
pale
perplexed
face
quickly
dissipated
this
idea
she
looks
frightened
thought
john
i
do
not
much
wonder
i
will
get
a
word
with
her
but
carlen
had
gone
before
he
missed
her
running
swiftly
upstairs
she
locked
the
door
of
her
room
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
at
her
open
window
presently
she
saw
wilhelm
going
down
to
the
brook
she
watched
his
every
motion
first
he
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
entire
length
of
the
field
following
the
brook
course
closely
stopping
often
and
bending
over
picking
flowers
a
curious
little
white
flower
called
grew
there
in
great
abundance
and
he
often
brought
bunches
of
it
to
her
perhaps
it
is
not
for
me
this
time
thought
carlen
and
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
after
a
time
wilhelm
ceased
gathering
the
flowers
and
seated
himself
on
his
favorite
rock
the
same
one
where
john
and
carlen
had
sat
the
night
before
will
he
stay
there
all
night
thought
the
unhappy
girl
as
she
watched
him
he
is
so
full
of
joy
he
does
not
want
to
sleep
what
will
become
of
me
what
will
become
of
me
at
last
wilhelm
arose
and
came
toward
the
house
bringing
the
bunch
of
flowers
in
his
hand
at
the
pasture
bars
he
paused
and
looked
back
over
the
scene
it
was
a
beautiful
picture
the
moon
making
it
light
as
day
even
from
carlen
window
could
be
seen
the
sparkle
of
the
brook
as
he
turned
to
go
to
the
barn
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
his
steps
lagged
he
wore
again
the
expression
of
gloomy
thought
a
new
fear
arose
in
carlen
breast
was
he
mad
had
the
wild
hilarity
of
his
speech
and
demeanor
in
the
evening
been
merely
a
new
phase
of
disorder
in
an
unsettled
brain
even
in
this
was
a
strange
sad
comfort
to
carlen
she
would
rather
have
him
mad
with
alternations
of
insane
joy
and
gloom
than
know
that
he
belonged
to
another
long
after
he
had
disappeared
in
the
doorway
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
which
led
to
his
in
the
she
remained
kneeling
at
the
window
watching
to
see
if
he
came
out
again
then
she
crept
into
bed
and
lay
tossing
wakeful
and
anxious
till
near
dawn
she
had
but
just
fallen
asleep
when
she
was
aroused
by
cries
it
was
john
voice
he
was
calling
loudly
at
the
window
of
their
mother
bedroom
beneath
her
own
father
father
get
up
quick
come
out
to
the
barn
then
followed
confused
words
she
could
not
understand
leaning
from
her
window
she
called
what
is
it
john
what
has
happened
but
he
was
already
too
far
on
his
way
back
to
the
barn
to
hear
her
a
terrible
presentiment
shot
into
her
mind
of
some
ill
to
wilhelm
vainly
she
wrestled
with
it
why
need
she
think
everything
that
happened
must
be
connected
with
him
it
was
not
yet
light
she
could
not
have
slept
many
minutes
with
trembling
hands
she
dressed
and
running
swiftly
down
the
stairs
was
at
the
door
just
as
her
father
appeared
there
what
is
it
what
is
it
father
she
cried
what
has
happened
go
back
he
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
it
is
nothing
go
back
to
bed
it
is
not
for
vimmins
then
carlen
was
sure
it
was
some
ill
to
wilhelm
and
with
a
loud
cry
she
darted
to
the
barn
and
flew
up
the
stairway
leading
to
his
room
john
hearing
her
steps
confronted
her
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
good
god
carlen
he
cried
go
back
you
must
not
come
here
where
is
father
i
will
come
in
she
answered
wildly
trying
to
force
her
way
past
him
i
will
come
in
you
shall
not
keep
me
out
what
has
happened
to
him
let
me
by
and
she
wrestled
in
her
brother
strong
arms
with
strength
almost
equal
to
his
carlen
you
shall
not
come
in
you
shall
not
see
he
cried
shall
not
see
she
shrieked
is
he
dead
yes
my
sister
he
is
dead
answered
john
solemnly
in
the
next
instant
he
held
carlen
unconscious
form
in
his
arms
and
when
farmer
weitbreck
half
dazed
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
first
sight
which
met
his
eyes
was
his
daughter
held
in
her
brother
arms
apparently
lifeless
her
head
hanging
over
his
shoulder
haf
she
seen
him
he
whispered
no
said
john
i
only
told
her
he
was
dead
to
keep
her
from
going
in
and
she
fainted
dead
away
ach
groaned
the
old
man
dis
is
hard
on
her
yes
sighed
the
brother
it
is
a
cruel
shame
swiftly
they
carried
her
to
the
house
and
laid
her
on
her
bed
then
returned
to
their
dreadful
task
in
wilhelm
chamber
hung
by
a
stout
leathern
strap
from
the
beam
there
swung
the
dead
body
of
wilhelm
rütter
cold
stiff
he
had
been
dead
for
hours
he
must
have
done
the
deed
soon
after
bidding

johan
said
the
old
man
shaking
from
head
to
foot
with
horror
as
he
helped
his
son
lift
down
the
body
yes
answered
john
that
must
be
it
i
expect
he
has
been
mad
all
along
i
do
not
believe
last
night
was
the
beginning
it
was
not
like
any
sane
man
to
be
so
gloomy
as
he
was
and
never
speak
to
a
living
soul
but
i
never
once
thought
of
his
being
crazy
look
father
he
continued
his
voice
breaking
into
a
sob
he
has
left
these
flowers
here
for
carlen
that
does
not
look
as
if
he
was
crazy
what
can
it
all
mean
on
the
top
of
a
small
chest
lay
the
bunch
of
white
with
a
paper
beneath
it
on
which
was
written
for
carlen
weitbreck
these
and
the
carvings
in
the
box
all
in
memory
of
wilhelm
he
meant
to

the
old

the

he
vas
great
for

dat

not
goot
as
he
the
body
was
laid
once
more
on
the
narrow
pallet
where
it
had
slept
for
its
last
few
weeks
on
earth
and
the
two
men
stood
by
its
side
discussing
what
should
next
be
done
how
the
necessary
steps
could
be
taken
with
least
possible
publicity
when
suddenly
they
heard
the
sound
of
horses
feet
and
wheels
and
looking
out
they
saw
hans
dietman
and
his
wife
driving
rapidly
into
the
yard
mein
gott
vat
bring
dem
here
dis
time
in
day
exclaimed
farmer
weitbreck
if
dey
ask
for
wilhelm
dey
must
all
know
yes
replied
john
that
makes
no
difference
everybody
will
have
to
know
and
he
ran
swiftly
down
to
meet
the
strangely
arrived
neighbors
his
first
glance
at
their
faces
showed
him
that
they
had
come
on
no
common
errand
they
were
pale
and
full
of
excitement
and
hans
first
word
was
vere
is
dot
man
you
sent
to
mine
place
yesterday
wilhelm
stammered
farmer
weitbreck
wilhelm
repeated
hans
scornfully
his
name
is
not
his
name
is
carl
carl
lepmann
and
he
is
murderer
he
killed
von
man
shepherd
in
our
town
last
spring
and
dey
never
get
trail
of
him
so
soon
he
came
in
our
kitchen
yesterday
my
vife
she
knew
him
she
wait
till
i
get
home
ve
came
ven
it
vas
yet
dark
to
let
you
know
vot
man
vas
in
your
house
farmer
weitbreck
and
his
son
exchanged
glances
each
was
too
shocked
to
speak
and
dietman
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
bewilderment
maype
you
tink
ve
speak
not
truth
hans
continued
just
let
him
come
here
to
our
face
and
you
will
see
no
said
john
in
a
low
voice
we
do
not
think
you
are
not
speaking
truth
he
paused
glanced
again
at
his
father
better
take
them
up
he
said
the
old
man
nodded
silently
even
his
hard
and
phlegmatic
nature
was
shaken
to
the
depths
john
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
saying
briefly
come
the
dietmans
followed
in
bewilderment
there
he
is
said
john
pointing
to
the
tall
figure
rigid
under
the
white
folds
we
found
him
here
only
an
hour
ago
hung
from
the
beam
a
silence
fell
on
the
group
hans
spoke
first
he
know
dat
we
know
so
he
kill
himself
to
save
dat
de
hangman
have
trouble
john
resented
the
flippant
tone
he
understood
now
the
whole
mystery
of
wilhelm
life
in
this
house
he
has
never
known
a
happy
minute
since
he
was
here
he
said
he
never
smiled
nor
spoke
if
he
could
help
it
only
last
night
after
he
came
back
from
your
place
he
laughed
and
sang
and
was
merry
and
looked
like
another
man
and
he
bade
us
all
over
and
over
and
shook
hands
with
every
one
he
had
made
up
his
mind
you
see
that
the
end
had
come
and
it
was
nothing
but
a
relief
to
him
he
was
glad
to
die
he
had
not
courage
before
but
now
he
knew
he
would
be
arrested
he
had
courage
to
kill
himself
poor
fellow
i
pity
him
and
john
smoothed
out
the
white
folds
over
the
clasped
hands
on
the
breast
resting
at
last
he
has
been
worse
punished
than
if
he
had
been
hung
in
the
beginning
he
said
and
turned
from
the
bed
facing
the
dietmans
as
if
he
constituted
himself
the
dead
man
protector
i
think
no
one
but
ourselves
need
know
he
continued
thinking
in
his
heart
of
carlen
it
is
enough
that
he
is
dead
there
is
no
good
to
be
gained
for
any
one
that
i
see
by
telling
what
he
had
done
no
said
dietman
tearfully
but
her
husband
exclaimed
in
a
vindictive
tone
i
see
not
why
it
is
to
be
covered
in
secret
he
is
murderer
it
is
to
be
sent
vord
to
mayence
he
vas
found
yes
they
ought
to
know
there
said
john
slowly
but
there
is
no
need
for
it
to
be
known
here
he
has
injured
no
one
here
no
exclaimed
farmer
weitbreck
he
haf
harm
nobody
here
he
vas
goot
i
haf
ask
him
to
stay
and
haf
home
in
my
house
it
was
a
strange
story
early
in
the
spring
it
seemed
about
six
weeks
before
hans
dietman
and
his
wife
gretchen
were
married
a
shepherd
on
the
farm
adjoining
gretchen
father
had
been
murdered
by
a
on
the
same
farm
they
had
had
high
words
about
a
dog
and
had
come
to
blows
but
were
parted
by
some
of
the
other
hands
and
had
separated
and
gone
their
ways
to
their
work
with
their
respective
flocks
this
was
in
the
morning
at
night
neither
they
nor
their
flocks
returned
and
search
being
made
the
dead
body
of
the
younger
shepherd
was
found
lying
at
the
foot
of
a
precipice
mutilated
and
wounded
far
more
than
it
would
have
been
by
any
accidental
fall
the
other
shepherd
carl
lepmann
had
disappeared
and
was
never
again
seen
by
any
one
who
knew
him
until
this
previous
day
when
he
had
entered
the
dietmans
door
bearing
his
message
from
the
weitbreck
farm
at
the
first
sight
of
his
face
gretchen
dietman
had
recognized
him
thrown
up
her
arms
involuntarily
and
cried
out
in
german
my
god
the
man
that
killed
the
shepherd
carl
had
halted
on
the
threshold
at
hearing
these
words
and
his
countenance
had
changed
but
it
was
only
for
a
second
he
regained
his
composure
instantly
entered
as
if
he
had
heard
nothing
delivered
his
message
and
afterward
remained
for
some
time
on
the
farm
chatting
with
the
laborers
and
seeming
in
excellent
spirits
and
so
vas
he
ven
he
come
home
said
farmer
weitbreck
he
make
dat
ve
all
laugh
and
laugh
like
notings
ever
vas
before
never
before
he
open
his
mouth
to
speak
he
vas
like
at
funeral
all
times
night
and
day
but
now
he
seem
full
of
joy
it
is
de
most
strange
ting
as
i
haf
seen
in
my
life
i
do
not
think
so
father
said
john
i
do
not
wonder
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
his
burden
it
proved
of
no
use
to
try
to
induce
hans
dietman
to
keep
poor
secret
he
saw
no
reason
why
a
murderer
should
be
sheltered
from
disgrace
to
have
his
name
held
up
for
the
deserved
execration
seemed
to
hans
the
only
punishment
left
for
one
who
had
thus
evaded
the
hangman
and
he
proceeded
to
inflict
this
punishment
to
the
extent
of
his
ability
finding
that
the
tale
could
not
be
kept
secret
john
nerved
himself
to
tell
it
to
carlen
she
heard
it
in
silence
from
beginning
to
end
asked
a
few
searching
questions
and
then
to
john
unutterable
astonishment
said
wilhelm
never
killed
that
man
you
have
none
of
you
stopped
to
see
if
there
was
proof
but
why
did
he
fly
liebchen
asked
john
because
he
knew
he
would
be
accused
of
the
murder
she
replied
they
might
have
been
fighting
at
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
the
shepherd
fell
over
or
the
shepherd
might
have
been
killed
by
some
one
else
and
wilhelm
have
found
the
body
he
never
killed
him
john
never
there
was
something
in
carlen
confident
belief
which
communicated
itself
to
john
mind
and
coupled
with
the
fact
that
there
was
certainly
only
circumstantial
evidence
against
wilhelm
slowly
brought
him
to
sharing
her
belief
and
tender
sorrow
but
they
were
alone
in
this
belief
and
alone
in
their
sorrow
the
verdict
of
the
community
was
unhesitatingly
unqualifiedly
against
wilhelm
would
a
man
hang
himself
if
he
knew
he
were
innocent
said
everybody
all
the
more
if
he
knew
he
could
never
prove
himself
innocent
said
john
and
carlen
but
no
one
else
thought
so
and
how
could
the
truth
ever
be
known
in
this
world
wilhelm
was
buried
in
a
corner
of
the
meadow
field
he
had
so
loved
before
two
years
had
passed
wild
blackberry
vines
had
covered
the
grave
with
a
thick
mat
of
tangled
leaves
green
in
summer
in
the
autumn
and
before
three
more
had
passed
there
was
no
one
in
the
place
who
knew
the
secret
of
the
grave
farmer
weitbreck
and
his
wife
were
both
dead
and
the
estate
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
strangers
who
had
heard
the
story
of
wilhelm
and
knew
that
his
body
was
buried
somewhere
on
the
farm
but
in
which
field
they
neither
asked
nor
cared
and
there
was
no
mourner
to
tell
the
story
john
weitbreck
had
realized
his
dream
of
going
west
a
free
man
at
last
and
by
no
means
a
poor
one
he
looked
out
over
scores
of
broad
fields
of
his
own
one
of
the
most
fertile
of
the
oregon
valleys
alf
was
with
him
and
carlen
and
carlen
was
alf
wife
placid
contented
wife
and
fond
and
happy
mother
so
small
ripples
did
there
remain
from
the
tempestuous
waves
beneath
which
carl
lepmann
life
had
gone
down
some
deftly
carved
boxes
and
figures
of
chamois
and
their
hunters
stood
on
carlen
mantel
much
admired
by
her
neighbors
and
longed
for
by
her
toddling
girl
these
and
a
bunch
of
dried
and
crumbling
blossoms
of
the
ladies
tress
were
all
that
had
survived
the
storm
the
dried
flowers
were
in
the
largest
of
the
boxes
they
lay
there
side
by
side
with
a
bit
of
carved
abalone
shell
alf
had
got
from
a
nez
perce
indian
and
some
curious
seaweeds
he
had
picked
up
at
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
river
carlen
one
gilt
brooch
was
kept
in
the
same
box
and
when
she
took
it
out
of
a
sunday
the
sight
of
the
withered
flowers
always
reminded
her
of
wilhelm
she
could
not
have
told
why
she
kept
them
it
certainly
was
not
because
they
woke
in
her
breast
any
thoughts
which
alf
might
not
have
read
without
being
disquieted
she
sometimes
sighed
as
she
saw
them
poor
wilhelm
that
was
all
but
there
came
one
day
a
letter
to
john
that
awoke
even
in
motherly
and
contented
heart
strange
echoes
from
that
past
which
she
had
thought
forever
left
behind
it
was
a
letter
from
hans
dietman
who
still
lived
on
the
pennsylvania
farm
and
who
had
been
recently
joined
there
by
a
younger
brother
from
germany
this
brother
had
brought
news
which
too
late
vindicated
the
memory
of
wilhelm
carlen
had
been
right
he
was
no
murderer
it
was
with
struggling
emotions
that
carlen
heard
the
tale
pride
joy
passionate
regret
old
affection
revived
john
was
half
afraid
to
go
on
as
he
saw
her
face
flushing
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
kindling
and
shining
with
a
light
he
had
not
seen
in
them
since
her
youth
go
on
go
on
she
cried
why
do
you
stop
did
i
not
tell
you
so
and
you
never
half
believed
me
now
you
see
i
was
right
i
told
you
wilhelm
never
harmed
a
human
being
it
was
indeed
a
heartrending
story
to
come
so
late
so
bootless
now
to
the
poor
boy
who
had
slept
all
these
years
in
the
nameless
grave
even
its
place
forgotten
it
seemed
that
a
man
sentenced
in
mayence
to
be
executed
for
murder
had
confessed
the
day
before
his
execution
that
it
was
he
who
had
killed
the
shepherd
of
whose
death
carl
lepmann
had
so
long
been
held
guilty
they
had
quarrelled
about
a
girl
a
faithless
creature
forsworn
to
both
of
them
and
worth
no
man
love
or
desire
but
jealous
anger
got
the
better
of
their
sense
and
they
grappled
in
fight
each
determined
to
kill
the
other
the
shepherd
had
the
worst
of
it
and
just
as
he
fell
mortally
hurt
carl
lepmann
had
come
up
had
come
up
in
time
to
see
the
murderer
leap
on
his
horse
to
ride
away
in
a
voice
which
the
man
said
had
haunted
him
ever
since
carl
had
cried
out
my
god
you
ride
away
and
leave
him
dead
and
it
will
be
i
who
have
killed
him
for
this
morning
we
fought
so
they
had
to
tear
us
apart
smitten
with
remorse
the
man
had
with
carl
help
lifted
the
body
and
thrown
it
over
the
precipice
at
the
foot
of
which
it
was
afterward
found
he
then
endeavored
to
persuade
the
lad
that
it
would
never
be
discovered
and
he
might
safely
return
to
his
employer
farm
but
carl
terror
was
too
great
and
he
had
finally
been
so
wrought
upon
by
his
entreaties
that
he
had
taken
him
two
days
journey
by
lonely
ways
the
two
riding
sometimes
in
turn
sometimes
together
two
days
and
two
nights
journey
till
they
reached
the
sea
where
carl
had
taken
ship
for
america
he
was
a
good
lad
a
lad
said
the
murderer
he
might
have
accused
me
in
many
a
village
and
stood
as
good
chance
to
be
believed
as
i
if
he
had
told
where
the
shepherd
body
was
thrown
but
he
could
be
frightened
as
easily
as
a
woman
and
all
he
thought
of
was
to
fly
where
he
would
never
be
heard
of
more
and
it
was
the
thought
of
him
from
that
day
till
now
has
given
me
more
misery
than
the
thought
of
the
dead
man
carlen
was
crying
bitterly
the
letter
was
just
ended
when
alf
came
into
the
room
asking
bewilderedly
what
it
was
all
about
the
name
wilhelm
meant
nothing
to
him
it
was
the
summer
before
wilhelm
came
that
he
had
begun
this
oregon
farm
which
he
from
the
first
had
fondly
dedicated
to
carlen
in
his
thoughts
and
when
he
went
back
to
pennsylvania
after
her
he
found
her
the
same
as
when
he
went
away
only
comelier
and
sweeter
it
would
not
be
easy
to
give
alf
an
uncomfortable
thought
about
his
carlen
but
he
did
not
like
to
see
her
cry
neither
when
he
had
heard
the
whole
story
did
he
see
why
her
tears
need
have
flowed
so
freely
it
was
sad
no
doubt
and
a
bitter
shame
too
for
one
man
to
suffer
and
go
to
his
grave
that
way
for
the
sin
of
another
but
it
was
long
past
and
gone
no
use
in
crying
over
it
now
what
a
foolish
wife
it
is
he
said
in
gruff
fondness
laying
his
hand
on
carlen
shoulder
crying
over
a
man
dead
and
buried
these
seven
years
and
none
of
our
kith
or
kin
either
poor
fellow
it
was
a
shame
but
carlen
said
nothing
little
bel
supplement
indeed
then
my
mother
i
not
take
the
school
at
wissan
bridge
without
they
promise
me
a
supplement
it
the
worst
school
i
a
prince
edward
island
i
doubt
but
ye
young
to
tackle
wi
them
boys
bel
replied
the
mother
gazing
into
her
daughter
face
with
an
intent
expression
in
which
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
predominated
anxiety
or
fond
pride
i
sooner
see
ye
take
any
other
school
between
this
charlottetown
an
no
supplement
i
not
afraid
my
mother
but
i
manage
well
enough
but
not
undertake
it
for
the
same
money
as
a
decent
school
is
taught
they
promise
me
five
pounds
supplement
at
the
end
o
the
year
or
i
not
set
foot
i
the
place
maybe
they
not
be
for
givin
ye
the
school
at
all
when
they
see
what
yer
youth
replied
the
mother
in
a
tone
there
was
between
this
mother
and
daughter
a
continual
undercurrent
of
possible
antagonism
overlain
and
usually
smothered
out
of
sight
by
passionate
attachment
on
both
sides
little
bel
tossed
her
head
age
is
not
everything
that
goes
to
the
makkin
o
a
teacher
she
retorted
there
grizzy
mcleod
teachin
at
the
cove
these
eight
years
an
i
shame
her
myself
any
day
she
likes
wi
spellin
an
the
lines
an
if
there
ever
a
boy
in
a
school
o
mine
that
gie
me
a
floutin
answer
such
i
heard
her
take
by
the
dozen
i
warrant
ye
he
get
a
birchin
an
the
trustees
think
there
no
teacher
like
grizzy
i
not
afraid
grizzy
never
had
any
great
schoolin
herself
replied
her
mother
piously
there
no
girl
in
all
the
farms
that
had
what
ye
had
bel
it
is
the
schoolin
mother
retorted
little
bel
the
schoolin
got
nothin
to
do
with
it
i
teach
a
school
better
than
grizzy
mcleod
if
i
never
had
a
day
schoolin
an
now
if
that
not
the
talk
of
a
silly
retorted
the
quickly
angered
parent
will
ye
be
tellin
me
perhaps
then
that
them
that
ca
read
theirselves
is
to
be
set
to
teach
letters
little
bel
was
too
loyal
at
heart
to
her
illiterate
mother
to
wound
her
further
by
reiterating
her
point
throwing
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
kissing
her
warmly
she
exclaimed
eh
my
mother
it
not
a
silly
that
ye
could
ever
have
for
a
child
wi
that
clear
head
and
the
wise
things
always
said
to
us
from
the
time
we
in
our
cradles
ye
never
a
child
that
so
clever
as
ye
are
yerself
i
did
mean
just
what
i
said
ye
must
know
surely
only
that
the
schoolin
part
is
the
smallest
part
o
the
keepin
a
school
an
i
never
give
in
to
such
nonsense
as
that
either
said
the
mother
only
half
mollified
ye
can
ask
yer
father
if
ye
like
if
it
stands
not
to
reason
that
the
more
a
teacher
knows
the
more
he
can
teach
he
take
the
conceit
out
o
ye
better
than
i
can
and
good
isabella
mcdonald
turned
angrily
away
and
drummed
on
the
with
her
to
relieve
her
nervous
discomfort
at
this
slight
passage
at
arms
with
her
daughter
little
bel
face
flushed
and
with
compressed
lips
she
turned
silently
to
the
little
that
hung
so
high
on
the
wall
she
could
but
just
see
her
chin
in
it
as
she
slowly
tied
her
pink
bonnet
strings
she
grew
happier
in
truth
she
would
have
been
a
maiden
hard
to
console
if
the
face
that
looked
back
at
her
from
the
quaint
oak
leaf
and
acorn
wreath
had
not
comforted
her
inmost
soul
and
made
her
again
at
peace
with
herself
and
as
the
mother
looked
on
she
too
was
comforted
and
in
five
minutes
more
when
little
bel
was
ready
to
say
they
flung
their
arms
around
each
other
and
embraced
and
kissed
and
the
daughter
said
t
ye
now
mother
wish
me
well
an
ye
see
that
i
get
it
supplement
an
all
she
added
slyly
and
the
mother
said
good
luck
t
ye
child
an
it
luck
to
them
that
gets
ye
that
was
the
way
quarrels
always
ended
between
isabella
mcdonald
and
her
oldest
daughter
the
oldest
daughter
and
yet
only
just
turned
of
twenty
and
there
were
eight
children
younger
than
she
and
one
older
this
is
the
way
among
the
scotch
in
prince
edward
island
children
come
tumbling
into
the
world
like
rabbits
in
a
pen
and
have
to
scramble
for
a
living
almost
as
soon
and
as
hard
as
the
rabbits
it
is
a
narrow
life
they
lead
and
full
of
hardships
and
deprivations
but
it
has
its
compensations
sturdy
virtues
in
sturdy
bodies
come
of
it
the
sort
of
virtue
made
by
the
straitest
calvinism
and
the
sort
of
body
made
out
of
oatmeal
and
milk
one
might
do
much
worse
than
inherit
both
it
seemed
but
a
few
years
ago
that
john
mcdonald
had
wooed
and
won
isabella
mcintosh
wooed
her
with
difficulty
in
the
bosom
of
her
family
of
six
brothers
and
five
sisters
and
won
her
triumphantly
in
spite
of
the
open
and
contemptuous
opposition
of
one
of
the
five
sisters
for
john
himself
was
one
of
seven
in
his
father
home
and
whoever
married
john
must
go
there
to
live
to
be
only
a
daughter
in
a
house
and
take
a
daughter
share
of
the
brunt
of
everything
and
nothing
to
be
got
except
a
living
and
it
was
a
poor
living
the
mcdonald
farm
gave
beside
the
mcintosh
the
mcintosh
sisters
said
and
moreover
the
saint
did
not
live
that
could
get
on
with
john
mother
that
was
what
had
made
him
the
silent
fellow
he
was
always
being
told
by
his
mother
to
hold
his
tongue
and
have
done
speaking
and
a
fine
there
be
when
isabella
hasty
tongue
and
temper
were
flung
into
that
batch
there
was
no
gainsaying
all
this
nevertheless
isabella
married
john
went
home
with
him
into
his
father
house
put
her
shoulder
against
her
spoke
in
the
family
wheel
and
did
her
best
and
when
ten
years
later
as
reward
of
her
affectionate
trust
and
patience
she
found
herself
sole
mistress
of
the
mcdonald
farm
she
did
not
feel
herself
ill
paid
the
old
father
and
mother
were
dead
two
sisters
had
died
and
two
had
married
and
the
two
sons
had
gone
to
the
states
to
seek
better
fortunes
than
were
to
be
made
on
prince
edward
island
john
as
eldest
son
had
according
to
the
custom
of
the
island
inherited
the
farm
and
isabella
confronting
her
three
still
unmarried
sisters
was
able
at
last
triumphantly
to
refute
their
still
resentfully
remembered
objections
to
her
choice
of
a
husband
an
did
ye
suppose
i
did
not
all
the
time
know
that
it
was
to
this
it
was
sure
to
come
soon
or
late
she
said
with
justifiable
complacency
it
a
good
thing
to
have
a
house
o
one
own
an
an
estate
an
the
linen
that
in
the
house
i
no
need
to
turn
a
hand
to
the
for
ten
years
if
i
no
mind
an
ye
can
all
bide
your
times
an
see
what
john
make
o
the
farm
now
he
got
where
he
can
have
things
his
own
way
his
father
was
always
set
against
anything
that
was
new
the
place
is
run
down
shameful
but
john
bring
it
up
an
i
not
an
old
woman
yet
this
last
was
the
unkindest
phrase
john
mcdonald
permitted
herself
to
use
there
was
a
rebound
in
it
which
told
on
the
mclntosh
sisters
for
they
many
years
older
than
she
were
already
living
on
tolerance
in
their
father
house
where
their
oldest
brother
and
his
wife
ruled
things
with
an
iron
hand
all
hopes
of
a
husband
and
a
home
of
their
own
had
quite
died
out
of
their
spinster
bosoms
and
they
would
not
have
been
human
had
they
not
secretly
and
grievously
envied
the
comely
blooming
isabella
her
husband
children
and
home
but
with
all
this
it
was
no
life
that
isabella
had
led
at
the
very
best
and
with
the
best
of
farms
prince
edward
island
farming
is
no
to
fortune
only
a
living
and
that
of
the
plainest
is
to
be
made
and
when
children
come
at
the
rate
of
ten
in
years
it
is
but
a
small
showing
that
the
farmer
bank
account
makes
at
the
end
of
that
time
there
is
no
margin
for
fineries
luxuries
small
ambitions
of
any
kind
isabella
had
her
temptations
in
these
directions
but
john
was
firm
as
a
rock
in
withstanding
them
if
he
had
not
been
there
would
never
have
been
this
story
to
tell
of
his
little
bel
for
there
would
never
have
been
money
enough
in
the
bank
to
have
given
her
two
years
schooling
in
charlottetown
the
best
the
little
city
afforded
and
she
all
the
time
like
a
lady
said
the
severe
mcintosh
aunts
who
disapproved
of
all
such
ambitions
which
made
women
discontented
with
and
unfitted
for
farming
life
and
why
should
isabella
be
setting
her
daughters
up
for
teachers
they
said
it
no
great
schoolin
she
had
herself
and
if
her
girls
do
as
well
as
she
done
they
be
lucky
a
speech
which
made
john
mcdonald
laugh
out
when
it
was
reported
to
him
he
could
afford
to
laugh
now
i
mind
there
was
a
day
when
they
thought
different
o
me
from
that
he
said
i
obliged
to
them
for
nothin
but
i
like
the
little
one
to
have
a
better
chance
than
the
marryin
o
a
man
like
me
an
if
anything
get
it
for
her
it
be
schoolin
the
boardin
like
a
lady
which
had
so
offended
the
misses
sense
of
propriety
was
not
after
all
so
great
an
extravagance
as
they
had
supposed
for
it
was
in
his
own
brother
house
her
thrifty
father
had
put
her
and
had
stipulated
that
part
of
the
price
of
her
board
was
to
be
paid
in
produce
of
one
sort
and
another
from
the
farm
at
market
rates
an
so
ye
see
the
lass
be
eatin
it
there
of
here
he
said
to
his
wife
when
he
told
her
of
the
arrangement
an
it
a
sma
difference
it
make
to
us
i
the
end
o
the
two
years
an
a
big
difference
to
her
a
her
life
replied
isabella
warmly
ay
wife
said
john
if
it
fa
out
as
ye
hope
but
it
main
uncertain
countin
on
the
there
some
it
draws
up
some
it
draws
down
it
a
millstone
but
the
lass
is
bright
she
as
like
you
as
two
peas
in
a
pod
if
ye
had
the
chance
she
had
rising
color
in
isabella
face
warned
john
to
stop
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
see
how
often
there
hovers
a
flitting
shadow
of
jealousy
between
a
mother
and
the
daughter
to
whom
the
father
unconsciously
manifests
a
chivalrous
tenderness
akin
to
that
which
in
his
youth
he
had
given
only
to
the
sweetheart
he
sought
for
wife
unacknowledged
perhaps
even
unmanifested
save
in
occasional
swift
and
unreasonable
petulances
it
is
still
there
making
many
a
heartache
which
is
none
the
less
bitter
that
it
is
inexplicable
to
itself
and
dares
not
so
much
as
confess
its
own
existence
it
a
better
thing
for
a
woman
to
make
her
way
i
the
world
on
the
than
to
be
always
at
the
wheel
an
the
churn
an
the
floors
to
be
whitened
replied
isabella
sharply
an
one
year
like
another
till
the
year
comes
ye
buried
i
look
for
bel
to
marry
a
minister
or
maybe
even
better
ye
a
chance
at
a
minister
yersel
then
my
girl
replied
the
wise
john
an
ye
did
not
take
it
at
which
memory
the
wife
laughed
and
the
two
loyal
hearts
were
merry
together
for
a
moment
and
young
again
little
bel
had
indeed
even
before
the
charlottetown
schooling
had
a
far
better
chance
than
her
mother
for
in
her
mother
day
there
was
no
free
school
in
the
island
and
in
families
of
ten
and
twelve
it
was
only
a
turn
and
turn
about
that
the
children
had
at
school
since
the
free
schools
had
been
established
many
a
grown
man
and
woman
had
sighed
curiously
at
the
better
luck
of
the
youngsters
under
the
new
regime
no
excuse
now
for
the
poorest
man
children
not
knowing
how
to
read
and
write
and
more
and
if
they
chose
to
keep
on
nothing
to
hinder
their
dipping
into
studies
of
which
their
parents
never
heard
so
much
as
the
names
and
this
was
not
the
only
better
chance
which
little
bel
had
had
john
mcdonald
farm
joined
the
lands
of
the
manse
his
house
was
a
short
mile
from
the
manse
itself
and
by
a
bit
of
good
fortune
for
little
bel
it
happened
that
just
as
she
was
growing
into
girlhood
there
came
a
new
minister
to
the
manse
a
young
man
from
halifax
with
a
young
bride
the
daughter
of
an
officer
in
the
halifax
garrison
gentlefolks
both
of
them
but
and
full
of
fervor
in
their
work
for
the
souls
of
the
plain
given
into
their
charge
and
both
allan
and
allan
had
caught
sight
of
little
bel
face
on
their
first
sunday
in
church
and
allan
had
traced
to
her
a
voice
she
had
detected
in
the
singing
and
before
long
to
isabella
great
but
unspoken
pride
the
child
had
been
bidden
to
the
manse
for
the
minister
wife
to
hear
her
sing
and
from
that
day
there
was
a
new
vista
in
little
bel
life
her
voice
was
sweet
as
a
lark
and
as
pure
and
her
passionate
love
for
music
a
gift
in
itself
it
would
be
a
sin
not
to
cultivate
it
said
allan
to
her
husband
even
if
she
never
sees
another
piano
than
mine
nor
has
any
other
time
in
her
life
except
these
few
years
to
enjoy
it
she
will
always
have
had
these
and
nothing
can
separate
her
from
her
voice
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
at
sixteen
little
bel
went
to
charlottetown
for
her
final
two
years
of
study
at
the
high
school
she
played
almost
as
well
as
allan
herself
and
sang
far
better
and
in
all
isabella
mcdonald
of
the
child
future
vague
or
minute
there
was
one
feature
never
left
out
the
good
husband
coming
always
was
to
be
a
man
who
could
give
her
a
piano
in
charlottetown
bel
found
no
such
friend
as
allan
but
she
had
a
young
who
had
a
piano
and
poor
creature
that
she
was
bel
thought
hated
the
sight
of
it
detested
to
practise
and
shed
many
a
tear
over
her
lessons
this
girl
parents
were
thankful
to
see
their
daughter
impressed
by
bel
enthusiasm
for
music
and
so
well
did
the
clever
girl
play
her
cards
that
before
she
had
been
six
months
in
the
place
she
was
installed
as
to
her
own
schoolfellow
earning
thereby
not
only
money
enough
to
buy
the
few
clothes
she
needed
but
what
to
her
was
better
than
money
the
privilege
of
the
use
of
the
piano
an
hour
a
day
so
when
she
went
home
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
she
had
lost
nothing
in
fact
had
made
substantial
progress
and
her
old
friend
and
teacher
allan
was
as
proud
as
she
was
astonished
when
she
first
heard
her
play
and
sing
still
more
astonished
was
she
at
the
forceful
character
the
girl
had
developed
she
went
away
a
gentle
loving
clinging
child
her
nature
like
her
voice
belonging
to
the
order
of
birds
bright
flitting
merry
confiding
she
returned
a
woman
still
loving
still
gentle
in
her
manner
but
with
a
new
poise
in
her
bearing
a
resoluteness
a
fire
of
which
her
first
girlhood
had
given
no
suggestion
it
was
strange
to
see
how
similar
yet
unlike
were
the
comments
made
on
her
in
the
manse
and
in
the
farmhouse
by
the
two
couples
most
interested
in
her
welfare
it
is
wonderful
robert
said
allan
to
her
husband
how
that
girl
has
changed
and
yet
not
changed
it
is
the
music
that
has
lifted
her
up
so
what
a
glorious
thing
is
a
real
passion
for
any
art
in
a
human
soul
but
she
can
never
live
here
among
these
people
i
must
take
her
to
halifax
no
said
allan
her
work
will
be
here
she
belongs
to
her
people
in
heart
all
the
same
she
will
not
be
discontented
husband
i
doubtin
if
we
done
the
right
thing
by
the
child
after
a
said
the
mother
tearfully
to
the
father
at
the
end
of
the
first
evening
after
bel
return
she
got
the
ways
o
the
city
on
her
she
carries
herself
as
if
she
be
teachin
the
minister
his
own
self
i
doubt
but
she
feel
herself
strange
i
the
house
never
you
fash
yourself
replied
john
the
girl
got
her
head
that
a
but
her
heart
i
the
right
place
ye
see
she
put
her
strength
to
whatever
there
to
be
done
she
be
a
master
hand
at
teachin
i
wager
you
always
did
think
she
was
perfection
replied
the
mother
in
a
crisp
but
not
tone
an
i
not
gainsayin
that
she
not
as
near
it
as
is
often
seen
but
i
main
uneasy
to
see
her
herself
so
positive
if
john
thought
in
his
heart
that
bel
had
come
through
direct
heredity
on
the
maternal
side
by
this
carryin
herself
positive
he
knew
better
than
to
say
so
and
his
only
reply
was
a
laugh
with
you
see
i
not
afraid
she
a
good
child
an
always
was
bel
passed
her
examination
triumphantly
and
got
the
wissan
bridge
school
but
she
got
only
a
contingent
promise
of
the
supplement
it
went
sorely
against
her
will
to
waive
this
point
very
keenly
allan
who
was
on
the
examining
board
watched
her
face
as
she
modestly
yet
firmly
pressed
it
the
trustees
did
not
deny
that
the
wissan
bridge
school
was
a
difficult
and
unruly
one
that
to
manage
it
well
was
worth
more
money
than
the
ordinary
school
salaries
the
question
was
whether
this
very
young
lady
could
manage
it
at
all
and
if
she
failed
as
the
last
incumbent
had
failed
egregiously
too
the
school
had
broken
up
in
riotous
confusion
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
canny
scotchmen
of
the
school
board
did
not
wish
to
be
pledged
to
pay
that
extra
five
pounds
the
utmost
bel
could
extract
from
them
was
a
promise
that
if
at
the
end
of
the
year
her
teaching
had
proved
satisfactory
the
five
pounds
should
be
paid
more
they
would
not
say
and
after
a
short
sharp
struggle
with
herself
bel
accepted
the
terms
but
she
could
not
restrain
a
farewell
shot
at
the
trustees
as
she
turned
to
go
i
as
sure
o
my
five
pounds
as
if
ye
promised
it
downright
sirs
i
shall
keep
ye
a
good
school
at
wissan
bridge
we
make
it
guineas
then
miss
bel
cried
allan
enthusiastically
looking
at
his
colleagues
who
nodded
their
heads
and
said
laughing
yes
guineas
it
is
and
guineas
it
will
be
retorted
little
bel
as
with
cheeks
like
peonies
she
left
the
room
egad
but
she
a
fine
spirit
o
her
ain
an
as
bonnie
a
face
as
seen
since
i
remember
cried
old
dalgetty
the
senior
member
of
the
board
and
the
one
hardest
to
please
i
not
mind
bein
a
pupil
at
wissan
bridge
school
the
comin
term
myself
and
he
gave
an
old
privileged
chuckle
as
he
looked
at
his
colleagues
but
she
for
the
work
she
do
it
said
allan
confidently
ye
need
have
no
fear
my
wife
had
the
training
of
the
girl
since
she
was
little
she
got
the
best
o
stuff
in
her
she
do
it
allan
prediction
was
fulfilled
bel
did
it
but
she
did
it
at
the
cost
of
harder
work
than
even
she
had
anticipated
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
music
she
would
never
have
pulled
through
with
the
boys
of
wissan
bridge
by
her
music
she
tamed
them
the
young
marsyas
himself
never
piped
to
a
wilder
set
of
creatures
than
the
uncouth
lads
and
young
men
that
sat
in
astonishment
listening
to
the
first
song
their
pretty
young
schoolmistress
sang
for
them
to
have
singing
exercises
part
of
the
regular
school
routine
was
a
new
thing
at
wissan
bridge
it
took
like
and
when
little
bel
shrewd
and
diplomatic
as
a
statesman
invited
the
two
oldest
and
worst
boys
in
the
school
to
come
wednesday
and
saturday
afternoons
to
her
to
practise
singing
with
her
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
piano
so
as
to
be
able
to
help
her
lead
the
rest
her
sovereignty
was
established
they
were
not
conquered
they
were
converted
a
far
surer
and
more
lasting
process
neither
of
them
would
from
that
day
out
have
been
guilty
of
an
act
word
or
look
to
annoy
her
any
more
than
if
they
had
been
rival
lovers
suing
for
her
hand
as
bel
good
luck
would
have
it
and
bel
was
born
to
good
luck
there
is
no
denying
it
one
of
these
boys
had
a
good
tenor
voice
the
other
a
fine
barytone
they
had
both
in
their
rough
way
been
singers
all
their
lives
and
were
lovers
of
music
that
was
more
than
half
the
battle
my
mother
confessed
bel
when
at
the
end
of
the
first
term
she
was
at
home
for
a
few
days
and
was
recounting
her
experiences
except
for
the
singin
i
never
have
got
archie
mcleod
under
nor
sandy
stairs
either
i
doubt
they
have
been
too
many
for
me
but
now
they
like
two
more
teachers
to
the
fore
leave
the
to
them
for
a
day
an
not
a
lad
dare
stir
in
his
seat
without
their
leave
i
call
them
my
constables
an
teaching
them
a
small
bit
of
chemistry
out
o
school
hours
too
that
a
hold
on
them
they
see
me
out
safe
an
i
thinkin
owe
them
a
bit
part
o
the
five
guineas
when
i
get
it
she
added
reflectively
the
minister
says
ye
sure
of
it
replied
her
mother
he
says
the
best
school
in
all
his
circuit
i
do
know
how
ever
ye
come
so
quick
child
and
isabella
mcdonald
smiled
wistfully
spite
of
all
her
pride
in
her
clever
bairn
ye
see
then
what
he
say
after
the
examination
at
new
year
gleefully
replied
bel
if
he
thinks
the
school
is
so
good
now
it
be
twice
as
good
then
an
such
singin
as
was
never
heard
before
in
any
on
the
island
i
warrant
me
i
to
have
the
piano
over
for
the
day
to
the
archie
and
sandy
move
it
in
a
big
wagon
to
save
me
payin
for
the
cartin
an
i
to
pay
a
for
the
use
of
it
if
it
not
hurt
a
dear
bargain
but
she
not
let
it
go
a
shilling
less
and
to
be
sure
there
is
the
risk
to
be
counted
an
she
knew
i
have
it
if
it
had
been
twice
that
but
i
got
it
out
of
her
that
for
that
price
she
was
to
let
me
have
all
the
school
over
twice
a
week
for
two
months
before
to
practise
so
it
not
too
dear
ye
see
what
ye
hear
then
it
had
been
part
of
little
bel
good
luck
that
she
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
board
in
the
only
family
in
the
village
which
had
the
distinction
of
owning
a
piano
and
by
paying
a
small
sum
extra
she
had
obtained
the
use
of
this
piano
for
an
hour
each
day
the
best
investment
of
little
bel
life
as
the
sequel
showed
it
was
a
bitter
winter
on
prince
edward
island
by
new
year
time
the
roads
were
many
of
them
wellnigh
impassable
with
snow
fierce
winds
swept
to
and
fro
obliterating
tracks
by
noon
which
had
been
clear
in
the
morning
and
nobody
went
abroad
if
he
could
help
it
new
year
day
opened
fiercest
of
all
with
scurries
of
snow
lowering
sky
and
a
wind
that
threatened
to
be
a
gale
before
night
but
for
all
that
the
behind
the
wissan
bridge
were
crowded
full
of
steaming
horses
under
which
must
stamp
and
paw
and
shiver
and
endure
the
day
as
best
they
might
while
the
new
examination
went
on
everybody
had
come
the
fame
of
the
singing
of
the
wissan
bridge
school
had
spread
far
and
near
and
it
had
been
whispered
about
that
there
was
to
be
a
piece
sung
which
was
finer
than
anything
ever
sung
in
the
charlottetown
churches
the
was
decorated
with
evergreens
pine
and
spruce
the
new
year
day
having
fallen
on
a
monday
little
bel
had
had
a
clear
on
the
saturday
previous
and
her
faithful
henchmen
archie
and
sandy
had
been
busy
every
evening
for
a
week
drawing
the
boughs
on
their
sleds
and
piling
them
up
in
the
yard
the
teacher
desk
had
been
removed
and
in
its
place
stood
the
shining
red
mahogany
piano
a
new
and
wonderful
sight
to
many
eyes
there
all
was
ready
the
room
crowded
full
and
the
board
of
trustees
not
yet
arrived
there
sat
their
three
big
on
the
raised
platform
empty
a
depressing
and
perplexing
sight
to
little
bel
who
in
her
short
blue
merino
gown
with
a
knot
of
pink
ribbon
at
her
throat
and
a
roll
of
white
paper
her
schedule
of
exercises
in
her
hand
stood
on
the
left
hand
of
the
piano
her
eyes
fixed
expectantly
on
the
doors
the
minutes
lengthened
out
into
quarter
of
an
hour
half
an
hour
anxiously
bel
consulted
with
her
father
what
should
be
done
the
roads
are
something
fearfu
child
he
replied
we
must
make
big
allowance
for
that
they
sure
to
be
comin
at
least
some
one
them
it
was
never
known
that
they
failed
on
the
new
year
examination
an
it
would
seem
a
sore
disrespect
to
begin
without
them
here
before
he
had
finished
speaking
there
was
heard
a
merry
jingling
of
bells
outside
dozens
and
dozens
it
seemed
and
hilarious
voices
and
laughter
and
the
snorting
of
overdriven
horses
and
the
stamping
of
feet
and
more
voices
and
more
laughter
everybody
looked
in
his
neighbor
face
what
sounds
were
these
who
ever
heard
a
sober
school
board
arrive
in
such
fashion
as
this
but
it
was
the
school
board
nothing
less
a
good
deal
more
however
little
bel
heart
sank
within
her
as
she
saw
the
foremost
figure
entering
the
room
what
evil
destiny
had
brought
sandy
bruce
in
the
character
of
school
visitor
that
day
sandy
bruce
retired
himself
superintendent
of
the
hospital
in
charlottetown
exciseman
sandy
bruce
whose
sharp
and
unexpected
questions
had
been
known
to
floor
the
best
of
scholars
and
upset
the
plans
of
the
best
of
teachers
yes
here
he
was
sandy
bruce
himself
and
it
was
his
fierce
little
norwegian
ponies
with
their
silver
bells
and
fur
collars
the
admiration
of
all
charlottetown
that
had
made
such
a
clatter
and
stamping
outside
and
were
still
keeping
it
up
for
every
time
they
stirred
the
bells
tinkled
like
a
peal
of
chimes
and
woe
upon
woe
behind
him
came
not
bel
friend
and
pastor
allan
but
the
crusty
old
dalgetty
whose
doing
it
had
been
a
year
before
as
bel
very
well
knew
that
the
supplement
had
been
only
conditionally
promised
conflicting
emotions
turned
bel
face
scarlet
as
she
advanced
to
meet
them
the
most
casual
observer
could
not
have
failed
to
see
that
dismay
predominated
and
sandy
bruce
was
no
casual
observer
nothing
escaped
his
keen
glance
and
keener
intuition
and
it
was
almost
with
a
wicked
twinkle
in
his
little
hazel
eyes
that
he
said
still
shaking
off
the
snow
stamping
and
puffing
eh
but
ye
were
not
lookin
for
me
teacher
the
minister
was
sent
for
to
go
to
old
elspie
breadalbane
who
dyin
the
morn
and
i
happened
by
as
he
was
startin
an
he
made
me
promise
to
come
i
his
place
an
i
picked
up
my
friend
dalgetty
here
a
few
miles
back
wi
his
horse
flounderin
i
the
drifts
except
for
me
ye
ha
had
no
board
at
all
here
so
i
hope
ye
give
me
no
bad
welcome
as
he
spoke
he
was
studying
her
face
where
the
color
came
and
went
like
waves
not
a
thought
in
the
girl
heart
he
did
not
read
poor
little
lassie
he
was
thinking
to
himself
she
shaking
in
her
shoes
with
fear
o
me
i
not
put
her
out
she
a
dainty
blossom
of
a
girl
what
kept
her
from
being
trodden
down
by
these
wissan
bridge
racketers
i
like
to
know
but
when
he
seated
himself
on
the
platform
and
took
his
first
look
at
the
rows
of
pupils
in
the
centre
of
the
room
he
was
near
starting
with
amazement
the
wissan
bridge
racketers
as
he
had
mentally
called
them
were
not
to
be
seen
very
well
he
knew
many
of
them
by
sight
for
his
shipping
business
called
him
often
to
wissan
bridge
and
this
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
been
inside
the
which
had
been
so
long
the
dread
and
terror
of
school
boards
and
teachers
alike
a
puzzled
frown
gathered
between
sandy
bruce
eyebrows
as
he
gazed
what
has
happened
to
the
youngsters
then
have
they
all
been
convarted
i
this
twelvemonth
he
was
thinking
and
the
flitting
perplexed
thought
did
not
escape
the
observation
of
john
mcdonald
who
was
as
quick
a
reader
of
faces
as
sandy
himself
and
had
been
by
no
means
free
from
anxiety
for
his
little
bel
when
he
saw
the
redoubtable
visage
of
the
exciseman
appear
in
the
doorway
he
takin
it
in
quick
the
way
the
bairn
got
them
a
in
hand
thought
john
if
only
she
can
hold
hersel
cool
now
no
danger
bel
was
not
the
one
to
lose
a
battle
by
appearing
to
quail
in
the
outset
however
clearly
she
might
see
herself
outnumbered
and
sympathetic
and
eager
glances
from
her
constables
archie
and
sandy
told
her
that
they
were
all
ready
for
the
fray
these
glances
sandy
bruce
chanced
to
intercept
and
they
heightened
his
bewilderment
to
archie
mcleod
he
was
by
no
means
a
stranger
having
had
occasion
more
than
once
to
deal
with
him
boy
as
he
was
for
complications
with
riotous
misdoings
he
had
happened
to
know
also
that
it
was
archie
mcleod
who
had
been
head
and
front
of
the
last
year
revolt
in
the
school
the
one
boy
that
no
teacher
hitherto
had
been
able
to
control
and
here
stood
archie
mcleod
rising
in
his
place
leader
of
the
form
glancing
down
on
the
boys
around
him
with
the
eye
of
a
general
watching
the
teacher
eye
meanwhile
as
a
dog
watches
for
his
master
signal
and
the
orderly
yet
alert
and
joyously
eager
expression
of
the
whole
school
it
had
so
much
the
look
of
a
miracle
to
sandy
bruce
eye
that
not
having
been
for
years
accustomed
to
the
restraint
and
dignity
of
school
visitors
of
technical
official
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
a
loud
whistle
of
astonishment
luckily
recollecting
himself
in
time
he
smothered
the
whistle
and
the
whew
what
all
this
which
had
been
on
his
tongue
end
in
a
vigorous
and
unnecessary
blowing
of
his
nose
and
before
that
was
over
and
his
eyes
well
wiped
there
stood
the
whole
school
on
its
feet
before
him
and
the
room
ringing
with
such
a
chorus
as
was
never
heard
in
a
prince
edward
island
before
this
completed
his
bewilderment
and
swallowed
it
up
in
delight
if
sandy
bruce
had
an
overmastering
passion
in
his
rugged
nature
it
was
for
music
to
the
sound
of
the
he
had
often
said
he
would
march
to
death
and
not
know
it
for
dyin
the
drum
and
the
fife
could
draw
him
as
quickly
now
as
when
he
was
a
boy
and
the
sweet
singing
of
a
voice
was
all
the
token
he
wanted
of
the
certainty
of
heaven
and
the
existence
of
angels
when
little
bel
clear
soprano
notes
rang
out
carrying
along
the
fifty
young
voices
she
led
sandy
jumped
up
on
his
feet
waving
his
hand
in
a
sudden
heat
of
excitement
right
and
left
and
looking
swiftly
all
about
him
on
the
platform
he
said
it
not
sittin
take
such
welcome
as
this
my
neebors
each
man
and
woman
there
catching
the
quick
contagion
rose
and
it
was
a
tumultuous
crowd
of
glowing
faces
that
pressed
forward
around
the
piano
as
the
singing
went
on
fathers
mothers
rustics
all
and
the
children
pleased
and
astonished
sang
better
than
ever
and
when
the
chorus
was
ended
it
was
some
minutes
before
all
was
quiet
many
things
had
been
settled
in
that
few
minutes
john
mcdonald
heart
was
at
rest
the
music
carry
a
before
it
no
matter
if
they
do
make
a
failure
here
there
he
thought
the
bairn
is
a
right
the
mother
heart
was
at
rest
also
she
done
wonders
wi
wonders
i
doubt
not
but
it
go
through
as
it
begun
her
face
a
picture
to
look
on
bless
her
isabella
was
saying
behind
her
placid
smile
eh
but
she
won
her
guineas
out
o
us
thought
old
dalgetty
ungrudgingly
and
won
well
i
do
see
why
everybody
is
so
afraid
of
sandy
bruce
thought
little
bel
he
looks
as
kind
and
as
pleased
as
my
own
father
i
do
believe
he
ask
any
o
his
botherin
questions
what
sandy
bruce
thought
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
nearer
the
truth
probably
to
say
that
his
head
was
in
too
much
of
a
whirl
to
think
anything
certain
it
is
that
he
did
not
ask
any
botherin
questions
but
sat
leaning
forward
on
his
stout
oaken
staff
held
firmly
between
his
knees
and
did
not
move
for
the
next
hour
his
eyes
resting
alternately
on
the
school
and
on
the
young
teacher
who
now
that
her
first
fright
was
over
was
conducting
her
entertainment
with
the
composure
and
dignity
of
an
experienced
instructor
the
exercises
were
simple
declamations
reading
of
selected
compositions
examinations
of
the
principal
classes
at
short
intervals
came
songs
to
break
the
monotony
the
first
one
after
the
opening
chorus
was
banks
and
braes
of
bonnie
doon
at
the
first
bars
of
this
sandy
bruce
could
not
keep
silence
but
broke
into
a
lone
accompaniment
in
a
deep
bass
voice
untrained
but
sweet
ah
thought
little
bel
what
he
say
to
the
last
one
i
wonder
when
the
time
came
she
found
out
if
she
had
chosen
the
arrangement
of
her
music
with
full
knowledge
of
sandy
bruce
preferences
and
with
the
express
determination
to
rouse
him
to
a
climax
of
enthusiasm
she
could
not
have
done
better
when
the
end
of
the
simple
programme
of
recitations
and
exhibition
had
been
reached
she
came
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
her
cheeks
were
deep
pink
now
and
her
eyes
shone
with
excitement
and
said
turning
to
the
trustees
and
spectators
we
have
finished
now
all
we
have
to
show
for
our
year
work
and
we
will
close
our
entertainment
by
singing
wha
ha
wi
wallace
bled
ay
ay
that
wi
we
shouted
sandy
bruce
again
leaping
to
his
feet
and
as
the
first
of
the
grand
chords
of
that
grand
old
tune
rang
out
full
and
loud
under
little
bel
firm
touch
he
strode
forward
to
the
piano
and
with
a
kindly
nod
to
her
struck
in
with
the
full
force
of
his
deep
violoncello
notes
gathering
up
all
the
others
and
fusing
them
into
a
pealing
strain
it
was
electin
everybody
sang
old
voices
that
had
not
sung
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
or
more
joined
in
it
was
a
furor
dalgetty
swung
his
tartan
cap
sandy
his
hat
handkerchiefs
were
waved
staves
rang
on
the
floor
the
children
half
frightened
in
spite
of
their
pleasure
were
quieter
than
their
elders
eh
but
it
was
good
fun
to
see
the
old
folks
gone
crazy
for
once
said
archie
mcleod
in
recounting
the
scene
now
if
they
get
that
way
oftener
they
not
be
so
hard
down
on
us
youngsters
at
the
conclusion
of
the
song
the
first
thing
little
bel
heard
was
dalgetty
piping
voice
behind
her
and
guineas
it
is
miss
mcdonald
ye
won
it
fair
an
square
guineas
it
is
eh
what
guineas
what
is
ye
sayin
asked
sandy
bruce
his
eyes
steady
glowing
like
coals
gazing
at
little
bel
the
supplement
sir
answered
little
bel
lifting
her
eyes
roguishly
to
his
dalgetty
thought
i
was
too
young
for
the
school
an
promise
me
no
supplement
till
he
saw
if
i
be
equal
to
this
was
the
sly
bel
little
revenge
on
dalgetty
who
began
confusedly
to
explain
that
it
was
not
he
any
more
than
the
other
trustees
and
he
only
wished
that
they
had
all
been
here
to
see
as
he
had
seen
how
finely
the
school
had
been
managed
but
nobody
heard
what
he
said
for
above
all
the
humming
and
buzzing
and
laughing
there
came
up
from
the
centre
of
the
a
reiterated
call
of
sirs
trustees
mr
trustee
board
it
was
archie
mcleod
standing
up
on
the
backs
of
two
seats
waving
a
white
paper
and
trying
frantically
to
make
himself
heard
the
face
of
a
man
galloping
for
life
and
death
coming
up
at
the
last
second
with
a
reprieve
for
one
about
to
be
shot
could
hardly
be
fuller
of
intense
anxiety
than
was
archie
as
he
waved
his
paper
and
shouted
little
bel
gazed
bewilderingly
at
him
this
was
not
down
on
her
programme
of
the
exercises
what
could
it
be
as
soon
as
partial
silence
enabled
him
to
speak
archie
proceeded
to
read
a
petition
setting
forth
to
the
respected
board
of
trustees
that
the
undersigned
boys
and
girls
of
the
wissan
bridge
school
did
hereby
unanimously
request
that
they
might
have
no
other
teacher
than
miss
mcdonald
as
long
as
she
lives
this
last
clause
had
been
the
cause
of
bitter
disputing
between
archie
and
sandy
sandy
insisting
upon
having
it
in
archie
insisting
that
it
was
absurd
because
they
would
not
go
to
school
as
long
as
miss
mcdonald
lived
but
there
the
little
ones
and
the
babies
that
be
up
retorted
sandy
an
there
never
be
another
like
her
i
say
long
as
she
lives
and
as
long
as
she
lives
it
was
and
when
archie
with
an
unnecessary
emphasis
delivered
this
closing
clause
of
the
petition
it
was
received
with
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
platform
which
made
him
flush
angrily
and
say
with
a
vicious
punch
in
ribs
there
i
told
ye
it
spoiled
it
a
they
fit
to
die
over
it
an
sma
blame
to
ye
silly
but
he
was
reassured
when
he
heard
sandy
bruce
voice
overtopping
the
tumult
with
a
vary
sensible
request
my
lad
an
i
for
one
am
o
yer
way
o
thinkin
in
which
speech
was
a
deeper
significance
than
anybody
at
the
time
dreamed
in
that
and
hilarious
confusion
no
one
had
time
to
weigh
words
or
note
meanings
but
there
were
some
who
recalled
it
a
few
months
later
when
they
were
bidden
to
a
wedding
at
the
house
of
john
mcdonald
a
wedding
at
which
sandy
bruce
was
groom
and
little
bel
the
brightest
most
winsome
of
brides
it
was
an
odd
way
that
sandy
went
to
work
to
win
her
his
ways
had
been
odd
all
his
life
so
odd
that
it
had
long
ago
been
accepted
in
the
minds
of
the
charlottetown
people
that
he
would
never
find
a
woman
to
wed
him
only
now
and
then
an
unusually
perspicacious
person
divined
that
the
reason
of
his
bachelorhood
was
not
at
all
that
women
did
not
wish
to
wed
him
spite
of
his
odd
ways
but
that
he
himself
found
no
woman
exactly
to
his
taste
true
it
was
that
sandy
bruce
aged
forty
had
never
yet
desired
any
woman
for
his
wife
till
he
looked
into
the
face
of
little
bel
in
the
wissan
bridge
and
equally
true
was
it
that
before
the
last
strains
of
scots
wha
ha
wi
wallace
bled
had
died
away
on
that
memorable
afternoon
of
her
exhibition
of
her
school
he
had
determined
that
his
wife
she
should
be
this
was
the
way
he
took
to
win
her
no
one
can
deny
that
it
was
odd
there
was
some
talk
between
him
and
his
temporary
colleague
on
the
school
board
old
dalgetty
as
they
drove
home
together
behind
the
brisk
norwegian
ponies
and
the
result
of
this
conversation
was
that
the
next
morning
early
in
fact
before
little
bel
was
dressed
so
late
had
she
been
indulged
for
once
in
sleeping
after
her
hard
labors
in
the
exhibition
the
day
before
the
norwegian
ponies
were
jingling
their
bells
at
john
mcdonald
door
and
john
himself
might
have
been
seen
with
a
seriously
puzzled
face
listening
to
words
earnestly
spoken
by
sandy
as
he
shook
off
the
snow
and
blanketed
the
ponies
as
the
talk
progressed
john
glanced
up
involuntarily
at
little
window
could
it
be
that
he
sighed
at
any
rate
there
was
no
regret
in
his
heart
as
he
shook
sandy
hand
warmly
and
said
ye
my
free
consent
to
try
but
i
doubt
she
not
easy
won
she
her
head
now
her
ain
way
but
she
a
good
lass
an
a
sweet
one
an
i
need
no
man
to
tell
me
that
said
the
dauntless
sandy
as
he
gave
back
the
hearty
of
his
friend
an
she
never
repent
it
the
longest
day
o
her
life
if
she
ha
me
for
her
man
and
he
strode
into
the
house
bearing
in
his
hand
the
five
golden
guineas
which
his
friend
dalgetty
had
at
his
request
commissioned
him
to
pay
into
her
own
hand
mind
ye
mon
chuckled
dalgetty
mischievously
ye
not
be
leavin
it
wi
the
mither
to
which
sly
satire
only
reply
was
a
soft
laugh
and
nod
of
his
head
as
soon
as
little
bel
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
room
where
sandy
bruce
stood
waiting
for
her
she
knew
the
errand
on
which
he
had
come
it
was
written
in
his
face
neither
could
it
be
truthfully
said
to
be
a
surprise
to
little
bel
for
she
had
not
been
woman
had
she
failed
to
recognize
on
the
previous
day
that
the
rugged
scotchman
whole
nature
had
gone
out
toward
her
in
a
sudden
and
overmastering
attraction
sandy
looked
at
her
keenly
eh
ye
he
said
the
thing
i
came
to
say
t
ye
and
he
paused
still
eying
her
more
like
a
judge
than
a
lover
little
bel
turned
scarlet
this
was
not
her
ideal
of
a
wooer
know
what
mr
bruce
she
said
resentfully
how
should
i
know
what
ye
came
to
say
tush
tush
lass
do
na
prevaricate
sandy
began
his
eyes
gloating
on
her
lovely
confusion
do
na
preteend
but
the
sweet
blue
eyes
were
too
much
for
him
breaking
down
utterly
he
tossed
the
guineas
to
one
side
on
the
table
and
stretching
out
both
hands
toward
bel
he
exclaimed
ye
the
sweetest
thing
the
eyes
o
a
mon
ever
rested
on
lass
an
i
goin
to
win
ye
if
ye
let
me
and
as
bel
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
he
laid
one
hand
quietly
as
a
mother
might
across
her
lips
and
continued
na
na
i
not
let
ye
speak
yet
i
not
a
silly
to
look
for
ye
to
be
ready
to
say
me

askin
but

ye
say
me

not
refuse
me
the
only
thing
askin
the
day
an
that
that
ye
let
me
try
to
make
ye
love
me
ye
not
say
nay
to
that
lass
i
gie
my
life
to
it
and
now
he
waited
for
an
answer
none
came
tears
were
in
bel
eyes
as
she
looked
up
in
his
face
twice
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
and
twice
her
heart
and
the
words
failed
her
the
tears
became
drops
and
rolled
down
the
cheeks
sandy
was
dismayed
ye
not
afraid
o
me
ye
sweet
thing
are
ye
he
gasped
out
not
vex
ye
for
the
world
if
ye
bid
me
to
go
i
go
no
i
not
afraid
o
ye
bruce
sobbed
bel
i
do
know
what
it
is
makes
me
so
silly
i
not
afraid
o
ye
though
but
i
was
for
a
few
minutes
yesterday
she
added
archly
with
a
little
glint
of
a
roguish
smile
which
broke
through
the
tears
like
an
april
sun
through
rain
and
turned
sandy
head
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
ay
ay
he
said
i
minded
it
weel
an
i
said
to
myself
then
in
that
first
sight
i
had
o
yer
face
that
i
not
harm
a
hair
o
yer
head
oh
my
little
lass
would

gie
me
a
kiss
just
one
to
show
ye
not
afraid
and
to
gie
me
leave
to
try
to
win
ye
out
o
likin
into
lovin
he
continued
drawing
closer
and
bending
toward
her
and
then
a
wonderful
thing
happened
little
bel
who
although
she
was
twenty
years
old
and
had
by
no
means
been
without
her
admirers
had
never
yet
kissed
any
man
but
her
father
and
brothers
put
up
her
rosy
lips
as
confidingly
as
a
little
child
to
be
kissed
by
this
strange
wooer
who
wooed
only
for
leave
to
woo
an
if
he
only
known
it
he
might
ha
asked
a
he
wanted
then
as
well
as
later
said
little
bel
honestly
avowing
the
whole
to
her
mother
as
soon
as
he
put
his
hands
on
me
the
very
heart
in
me
said
he
was
my
man
for
a
my
life
an
there
no
shame
in
it
that
i
can
see
if
a
man
may
love
that
way
in
the
lighting
of
an
eye
why
may
not
a
girl
do
the
same
there
not
one
kind
o
heart
i
the
breast
of
a
man
an
another
kind
i
the
breast
of
a
woman
as
ever
i
heard
in
which
little
bel
in
her
innocence
was
wiser
than
people
wiser
than
she
and
after
this
there
is
no
need
of
telling
more
only
a
picture
or
two
which
are
perhaps
worth
sketching
in
few
words
one
is
the
expression
which
was
seen
on
sandy
bruce
face
one
day
not
many
weeks
after
his
first
interview
with
little
bel
when
in
reply
to
his
question
now
my
own
lass
what
ye
have
for
your
weddin
gift
from
me
tell
me
the
thing
ye
want
most
i
a
the
earth
an
if
it
in
my
means
ye
shall
have
it
the
day
ye
gie
me
the
thing
i
want
maist
i
the
whole
earth
i
got
it
sandy
said
little
bel
taking
his
face
in
her
hands
and
making
a
feint
of
kissing
him
then
withdrawing
coquettishly
wise
innocent
bel
sandy
understood
ay
my
lass
but
next
to
me
what
the
next
thing
ye
have
bel
hesitated
even
to
her
wooer
generosity
it
might
seem
a
daring
request
the
thing
she
craved
tell
me
lass
said
sandy
sternly
i
mair
money
than
ye
think
there
no
lady
in
a
charlottetown
can
go
finer
than
ye
if
ye
a
mind
for
shame
sandy
cried
bel
an
you
to
think
it
was
fine
apparel
be
askin
it
a
a
the
word
refused
to
leave
her
tongue
a
piano
sandy
and
she
gazed
anxiously
at
him
i
never
ask
ye
for
another
thing
till
the
day
o
my
death
sandy
if
ye
gie
me
that
sandy
shouted
in
delight
for
a
brief
space
a
fear
had
seized
him
of
which
he
now
felt
shame
indeed
that
his
sweet
lassie
might
be
about
to
ask
for
jewels
or
rich
attire
and
it
would
have
sorely
hurt
pride
in
her
had
this
been
so
a
piano
he
shouted
an
did
ye
not
think
i
that
in
my
mind
o
coorse
a
piano
an
every
other
instrument
under
the
skies
that
ye
wish
my
lass
ye
shall
have
the
more
music
ye
make
the
gladder
the
house
be
is
there
nothin
else
ye
want
lass
nothin
nothing
in
all
this
world
sandy
but
you
and
a
piano
replied
little
bel
the
other
picture
was
on
a
new
year
day
just
a
twelvemonth
from
the
day
of
little
bel
exhibition
in
the
wissan
bridge
it
is
a
bright
day
the
sleighing
is
superb
all
over
the
island
and
the
charlottetown
streets
are
full
of
gay
sleighs
and
jingling
bells
none
so
gay
however
as
sandy
bruce
and
no
bells
so
merry
as
the
silver
ones
on
his
fierce
little
norwegian
ponies
that
curvet
and
prance
and
are
all
their
driver
can
hold
rolled
up
in
furs
to
her
chin
how
rosy
and
handsome
looks
little
bel
by
her
husband
side
and
how
full
of
proud
content
is
his
face
as
he
sees
the
people
all
turning
to
look
at
her
beauty
and
who
is
this
driving
the
norwegian
ponies
who
but
archie
archie
mcleod
who
has
followed
his
young
teacher
to
her
new
home
and
is
to
grow
up
under
sandy
bruce
teachings
into
a
sharp
and
successful
man
of
the
shipping
business
and
as
they
turn
a
corner
they
come
near
running
into
another
sleigh
with
a
grizzled
old
head
looking
out
of
a
tartan
hood
and
eyes
like
hawks
dalgetty
himself
and
as
they
pass
the
head
nods
and
the
eyes
laugh
and
a
sharp
voice
cries
guineas
it
is
better
than
guineas
answered
back
sandy
bruce
quick
as
a
flash
and
in
the
same
second
cries
archie
from
the
front
seat
with
a
saucy
laugh
and
as
long
as
she
lives
mr
dalgetty
the
captain
of
the
heather
bell
you
might
have
known
he
was
a
scotchman
by
the
name
of
his
little
steamer
and
if
you
had
not
known
it
by
that
you
would
have
known
it
as
soon
as
you
looked
at
him
scotch
pure
unmitigated
unmistakable
scotch
was
donald
mackintosh
from
the
crown
of
his
auburn
head
down
to
the
soles
of
his
big
awkward
feet
six
feet
two
inches
in
his
stockings
he
stood
and
so
straight
that
he
looked
taller
even
than
that
eyes
full
of
a
canny
twinkle
freckles
yes
freckles
that
were
really
past
the
bounds
of
belief
for
up
into
his
hair
they
ran
and
to
the
rims
of
his
eyes
no
pale
dull
equivocal
freckles
such
as
might
be
mistaken
for
dingy
spots
of
anything
else
but
brilliant
freckles
almost
auburn
like
his
hair
once
seen
never
to
be
forgotten
were
donald
mackintosh
freckles
all
this
does
not
sound
like
the
description
of
a
handsome
man
but
we
are
not
through
yet
with
what
is
to
be
said
about
donald
mackintosh
looks
we
have
said
nothing
of
his
straight
massive
nose
his
tawny
curling
beard
which
shaded
up
to
yellow
around
a
broad
and
laughing
mouth
where
were
perpetually
flashing
teeth
of
an
even
ivory
whiteness
a
woman
might
have
coveted
no
not
handsome
but
better
than
handsome
was
donald
mackintosh
he
was
superb
everybody
said
so
nobody
could
have
been
found
to
dispute
it
nobody
but
donald
himself
he
thought
honestly
thought
he
was
hideous
all
that
he
could
see
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
looked
in
a
glass
was
an
expanse
of
fiery
red
freckles
topped
off
with
what
he
would
have
called
a
shock
of
red
hair
uglier
than
anything
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
he
said
to
himself
many
a
time
and
grew
shyer
and
shyer
and
more
afraid
of
women
each
time
he
said
it
and
all
this
while
there
was
not
a
girl
in
charlottetown
that
did
not
know
him
in
her
thoughts
if
indeed
she
did
not
openly
speak
of
him
as
that
splendid
donald
mackintosh
or
the
handsome
bell
captain
but
nothing
could
have
made
donald
believe
this
which
was
in
one
way
a
pity
though
in
another
way
not
if
he
had
known
how
women
admired
him
he
would
have
inevitably
been
more
or
less
spoiled
by
it
wasted
his
time
and
not
have
been
so
good
a
sailor
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
pity
to
see
him
forty
years
old
and
alone
in
the
world
not
a
chick
nor
a
child
of
his
own
nor
any
home
except
such
miserable
makeshifts
as
a
sailor
finds
in
inns
or
it
was
a
wonder
that
the
fellow
had
kept
a
cheery
nature
and
face
all
these
years
living
thus
but
the
heather
bell
stood
to
him
in
place
of
wife
children
home
there
is
no
passion
in
life
so
like
the
passion
of
a
man
for
a
woman
as
the
passion
of
a
sailor
for
his
craft
and
this
passion
donald
had
to
the
full
it
was
odd
how
he
came
to
be
a
born
sailor
his
father
and
his
father
fathers
as
far
back
as
they
knew
had
been
farmers
three
generations
of
them
on
the
prince
edward
island
farm
where
donald
was
born
and
still
more
generations
of
them
in
old
scotland
pure
scotch
on
both
sides
of
the
house
for
hundreds
of
years
were
the
mackintoshes
and
the
gaelic
tongue
was
freer
spoken
in
their
houses
than
english
the
mackintosh
farm
on
prince
edward
island
was
in
the
parish
of
orwell
head
and
donald
earliest
transgressions
and
earliest
pleasures
were
runaway
excursions
to
the
wharves
of
that
sleepy
shore
to
him
spruce
wharf
was
a
centre
of
glorious
maritime
adventure
the
small
sloops
that
plied
up
and
down
the
coast
of
the
island
running
in
at
the
inlets
and
stopping
to
gather
up
the
farmers
produce
and
take
it
to
charlottetown
markets
seemed
to
him
as
grand
as
indiamen
and
when
in
his
twelfth
year
he
found
himself
launched
in
life
as
a
on
one
of
these
sloops
whose
captain
was
a
friend
of
his
father
he
felt
that
his
fortune
was
made
and
so
it
was
he
was
in
the
line
of
promotion
by
virtue
of
his
own
enthusiasm
no
plank
too
small
for
the
born
sailor
to
swim
by
before
donald
was
he
himself
commanded
one
of
these
little
from
this
he
took
a
great
stride
forward
and
became
first
officer
on
the
steamer
plying
between
charlottetown
and
the
mainland
the
winter
service
on
this
boat
was
terrible
ploughing
and
cutting
through
nearly
solid
ice
for
long
days
and
nights
of
storm
donald
did
not
like
it
he
felt
himself
lost
out
in
the
wild
channel
his
love
was
for
the
water
near
shore
for
the
bays
inlets
and
he
had
known
since
he
was
a
child
he
began
to
think
he
was
not
so
much
of
a
sailor
as
he
had
supposed
so
great
a
shrinking
grew
up
in
him
winter
after
winter
from
the
perils
and
hardships
of
the
route
but
he
persevered
and
bided
his
time
and
in
ten
years
had
the
luck
to
become
owner
and
master
of
a
trim
little
which
had
been
known
for
years
as
the
sally
wright
making
two
trips
a
week
from
charlottetown
to
orwell
head
known
as
the
sally
wright
no
longer
however
for
the
first
thing
donald
did
was
to
repaint
her
from
stem
to
stern
white
with
green
and
pink
stripes
on
her
prow
a
cluster
of
pink
heather
blossoms
and
heather
bell
in
big
letters
on
the
side
when
he
was
asked
where
he
got
this
fancy
name
he
said
lightly
he
did
not
know
it
was
a
good
scotch
name
this
was
not
true
donald
knew
very
well
on
the
in
his
mother
kitchen
had
stood
always
a
pot
of
pink
heather
come
summer
come
winter
the
place
was
never
without
a
young
heather
growing
and
the
dainty
pink
bells
were
still
to
donald
the
man
as
they
had
been
to
donald
the
child
the
loveliest
flowers
in
the
world
but
he
would
not
for
the
profits
of
many
a
trip
have
told
his
comrade
captains
why
he
had
named
his
boat
the
heather
bell
he
had
a
sentiment
about
the
name
which
he
himself
hardly
understood
it
seemed
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
occasion
but
a
day
was
coming
when
it
would
seem
more
like
a
prophecy
than
a
mere
sentiment
he
had
builded
better
than
he
knew
when
he
chose
that
name
for
the
thing
nearest
his
heart
charlottetown
is
not
a
gay
place
its
standards
and
methods
of
amusement
are
simple
and
primitive
among
the
summer
pleasures
of
the
young
people
picnics
still
rank
high
and
picnic
excursions
by
steamboat
or
sloop
highest
of
all
through
june
and
july
hardly
a
daily
newspaper
can
be
found
which
does
not
contain
the
advertisement
of
one
or
more
of
these
excursions
after
donald
made
his
little
boat
so
fresh
and
gay
with
the
pink
and
green
colors
and
gave
her
the
winning
new
name
she
came
to
be
in
great
demand
for
these
occasions
how
much
the
captain
good
looks
had
to
do
with
the
heather
bell
popularity
as
a
it
would
not
do
to
ask
but
there
was
reason
enough
for
her
being
liked
aside
from
that
sweet
and
fresh
in
and
out
with
white
deck
the
chairs
and
settees
all
painted
green
and
a
gay
streamer
flying
white
with
three
green
bars
and
donald
mackintosh
captain
in
green
letters
and
below
these
a
spray
of
pink
heather
she
looked
more
like
a
craft
for
festive
sailing
than
for
cruising
about
from
one
to
another
picking
up
odds
and
ends
of
farm
produce
eggs
and
butter
and
oats
and
wool
with
now
and
then
a
passenger
donald
liked
this
slow
cruising
and
the
best
but
the
picnic
parties
were
profitable
and
he
took
them
whenever
he
could
he
kept
apart
however
from
the
as
much
as
possible
and
was
always
glad
at
night
when
he
had
landed
his
noisy
cargo
safe
back
at
the
charlottetown
piers
this
disposition
on
his
part
to
hold
himself
aloof
was
greatly
irritating
to
the
charlottetown
girls
and
to
no
one
of
them
so
much
as
to
pretty
katie
mccloud
who
because
she
was
his
second
cousin
and
had
known
him
all
her
life
felt
and
not
without
reason
that
he
ought
to
pay
her
something
in
the
shape
or
semblance
of
attention
when
she
was
on
board
his
boat
even
if
she
were
a
member
of
a
large
and
gay
party
most
of
whom
were
strangers
to
him
there
was
another
reason
too
but
katie
had
kept
it
so
long
locked
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
that
she
hardly
realized
its
force
and
cogency
and
if
she
had
would
have
laughed
and
put
it
as
far
from
her
thoughts
as
she
could
the
truth
was
katie
had
been
in
love
with
donald
ever
since
she
was
ten
years
old
and
he
was
twenty
a
long
time
seeing
that
she
was
now
thirty
and
he
forty
and
never
once
either
in
their
youth
or
their
middle
age
had
there
been
a
word
of
between
them
all
the
same
deep
in
her
heart
the
good
little
katie
had
kept
the
image
of
donald
in
sacred
tenderness
by
itself
no
other
man
however
earnest
and
katie
had
been
by
no
means
without
lovers
had
so
much
as
touched
this
sentiment
she
judged
them
all
by
this
secret
standard
and
found
them
all
wanting
she
did
not
pine
neither
did
she
take
a
step
of
forwardness
or
even
coquettish
advance
to
donald
she
was
too
full
of
scotch
reticence
for
that
the
only
step
she
did
take
in
hope
of
bringing
him
nearer
to
her
was
the
going
to
charlottetown
to
learn
the
milliner
trade
poor
katie
if
she
had
but
known
she
threw
away
her
last
chance
when
she
did
it
she
reasoned
that
donald
was
in
charlottetown
far
more
than
he
was
anywhere
else
that
if
she
stayed
at
home
on
the
farm
she
could
see
him
only
by
glimpses
when
the
heather
bell
ran
in
at
their
landing
in
and
out
and
off
again
in
an
hour
what
was
that
and
maybe
a
sunday
once
or
twice
a
year
and
at
a
christmas
gathering
no
wonder
katie
thought
that
in
the
town
where
his
business
lay
and
he
slept
three
nights
a
week
she
would
have
a
far
better
chance
that
he
would
be
glad
to
come
and
see
her
in
her
tidy
little
shop
but
when
donald
heard
what
she
had
done
he
said
gruffly
just
like
the
rest
all
for
ribbons
and
laces
and
silly
gear
i
thought
katie
more
sense
why
did
she
stay
at
home
on
the
farm
and
he
said
as
much
to
her
when
he
first
saw
her
in
her
new
quarters
she
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
she
wanted
to
support
herself
and
she
could
not
do
it
on
the
farm
no
need
no
need
said
her
relentless
cousin
there
was
plenty
for
all
on
the
farm
and
all
the
while
he
stood
glowering
at
the
counter
spread
with
gay
ribbons
and
artificial
flowers
and
katie
was
ready
to
cry
this
was
in
the
first
year
of
her
life
in
charlottetown
she
was
only
then
in
the
eight
years
since
then
matters
had
quieted
down
with
katie
it
seemed
certain
that
donald
would
never
marry
everybody
said
so
and
if
a
man
had
lived
till
forty
without
it
what
else
could
be
expected
if
katie
had
seen
him
seeking
other
women
her
quiet
and
unrewarded
devotion
would
no
doubt
have
flamed
up
in
jealous
pain
but
she
knew
that
he
gave
to
her
as
much
as
he
gave
to
any
occasional
and
kindly
courtesy
no
less
no
more
so
the
years
slipped
by
and
in
her
patient
industry
katie
forgot
how
old
she
was
growing
until
suddenly
on
her
thirtieth
birthday
something
the
sight
of
a
deepened
line
on
her
face
perhaps
or
a
pang
of
memory
of
the
old
childish
past
such
as
birthdays
always
bring
something
smote
her
with
a
sudden
consciousness
that
life
itself
was
slipping
away
and
she
was
alone
no
husband
no
child
no
home
except
as
she
earned
each
month
by
fashioning
bonnets
and
caps
for
the
charlottetown
women
money
enough
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
two
small
rooms
in
which
she
slept
cooked
and
plied
her
trade
some
tears
rolled
down
katie
face
as
she
sat
before
her
thinking
these
unwelcome
thoughts
i
go
to
the
orwell
head
picnic
she
said
to
herself
it
so
near
the
old
place
perhaps
donald
walk
over
home
with
me
it
long
since
he
seen
the
farm
i
be
bound
now
katie
did
not
say
to
herself
in
so
many
words
it
will
be
like
old
times
when
we
were
young
and
it
may
be
something
will
stir
in
donald
heart
for
me
at
the
sight
of
the
fields
not
only
did
she
not
say
this
she
did
not
know
that
she
thought
it
but
it
was
there
all
the
same
a
lurking
newly
revived
vague
despairing
sort
of
hope
and
because
it
was
there
she
spent
half
the
day
retrimming
a
bonnet
and
washing
and
ironing
a
gown
to
wear
to
the
picnic
and
after
long
and
anxious
pondering
of
the
matter
she
deliberately
took
out
of
her
best
box
of
artificial
flowers
a
bunch
of
white
heather
and
added
it
to
the
bonnet
trimming
it
did
not
look
overmuch
like
heather
and
it
did
not
suit
the
bonnet
of
which
katie
was
dimly
aware
but
she
wanted
to
say
to
donald
see
i
put
a
sprig
of
heather
in
my
bonnet
in
honor
of
your
boat
simple
little
katie
it
was
a
large
and
noisy
picnic
of
the
very
sort
donald
most
disliked
and
he
kept
himself
out
of
sight
until
the
last
moment
just
before
they
swung
round
at
spruce
wharf
then
as
he
stood
on
the
upper
deck
giving
orders
about
the
flinging
out
of
the
ropes
katie
looked
up
at
him
from
below
and
called
in
a
oh
donald
i
was
thinking
walk
over
home
instead
of
staying
here
to
the
dance
would
ye
be
goin
with
me
donald
they
be
glad
to
see
ye
ay
katie
answered
donald
that
will
i
and
be
glad
to
be
out
of
this
and
as
soon
as
the
boat
was
safely
moored
he
gave
his
orders
to
his
mate
for
the
day
and
leaping
down
joined
the
glad
katie
and
before
the
picnickers
had
even
missed
them
they
were
well
out
of
sight
walking
away
briskly
over
the
brown
fields
katie
was
full
of
happiness
as
she
glanced
up
into
donald
face
she
found
it
handsomer
and
kinder
than
she
had
seen
it
she
thought
for
many
years
it
was
for
this
i
came
donald
she
said
merrily
when
i
heard
the
dance
was
to
be
in
the
spruce
grove
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
and
surprise
the
folks
it
nigh
six
months
since
i
been
home
pity
ye
ever
left
it
my
girl
said
donald
gravely
the
home
the
place
for
women
but
he
said
it
in
a
pleasant
tone
and
his
eyes
rested
affectionately
on
katie
face
eh
but
ye
bonny
katie
do
ye
know
it
he
continued
his
glance
lingering
on
her
fresh
color
and
her
smiling
face
in
his
heart
he
was
saying
an
what
is
it
makes
her
so
it
was
an
old
face
she
had
on
the
last
time
i
saw
her
happiness
donald
happiness
even
those
few
minutes
of
it
had
worked
the
change
encouraged
by
this
praise
katie
said
pointing
to
the
flowers
in
her
bonnet
it
the
heather
ye
meanin
maybe
donald
an
not
me
an
it
not
he
replied
earnestly
almost
angrily
with
a
scornful
glance
at
the
flowers
ye
not
be
callin
that
heather
did
ye
never
see
true
heather
katie
it
no
more
like
the
stalks
ye
on
yer
head
than
a
barrow
like
my
boat
yonder
which
was
not
true
the
flowers
were
of
the
very
best
ever
imported
into
charlottetown
and
were
a
better
representation
of
heather
than
most
artificial
flowers
are
of
the
blossoms
whose
names
they
bear
donald
was
not
a
judge
and
if
he
had
been
it
was
a
cruel
thing
to
say
eyes
drooped
she
had
made
a
serious
sacrifice
in
putting
so
dear
a
bunch
of
flowers
on
her
bonnet
a
bunch
that
she
had
in
her
own
mind
been
sure
lady
gownas
of
gownas
house
would
buy
for
her
summer
bonnet
she
had
made
this
sacrifice
purely
to
please
donald
and
this
was
what
had
come
of
it
poor
katie
however
nothing
could
trouble
her
long
with
donald
by
her
side
in
the
sunny
bright
fields
and
she
would
have
him
to
herself
till
four
in
the
afternoon
as
they
drew
near
the
a
strange
sound
fell
on
their
ears
it
was
as
if
a
million
of
beehives
were
in
full
blast
of
buzzing
in
the
air
at
the
same
second
both
donald
and
katie
paused
listening
what
can
that
be
now
exclaimed
donald
before
the
words
had
left
his
lips
katie
cried
it
a
bee
elspie
the
are
great
fêtes
among
the
industrious
maidens
of
prince
edward
island
after
the
spring
shearings

over
the

and
carded
and
made
into
rolls
there

to
circulate
invitations

the
different
each
girl

her
on
her
shoulder
by
eight
in
the
morning
all

gathered
and
at
work
some
of
them
have
walked
ten
miles
or
more
and
barefoot
too
their
shoes
slung
over
the
shoulder
with
the
wheel
once
arrived
they
waste
no
time
the
rolls
of
wool
are
piled
high
in
the
corners
of
the
rooms
and
it
is
the
ambition
of
each
one
to
spin
all
she
can
before
dark
at
ten
cakes
and
lemonade
are
served
at
twelve
the
dinner
thick

and
then
the
day
work
is
done
after
that
a
little
chat
or
a
ramble
over
the
farm
and
at
eight
all
are
off
for
home
no
young
men
no
games
no
dances
yet
the
girls
look
forward
to
the
bees
as
their
greatest
spring
pleasures
and
no
one
grudges
the
time
or
the
strength
they
take
it
was
indeed
a
big
bee
that
elspie
mccloud
was
having
this
june
morning
twenty
young
girls
all
in
long
white
aprons
were
spinning
away
as
if
on
a
wager
when
donald
and
katie
appeared
at
the
door
the
door
opened
directly
into
the
large
room
where
they
were
katie
went
first
donald
hanging
back
behind
i
think
i
not
go
in
he
was
shamefacedly
saying
and
halting
on
the
step
when
above
all
the
and
came
a
glad
cry
why
there
katie
katie
mccloud
and
donald
mackintosh
for
sake
the
prince
edward
islander
strongest
ejaculation
come
in
come
in
and
in
a
second
more
a
vision
it
seemed
to
the
dazed
donald
but
it
was
not
a
vision
at
all
only
a
buxom
young
girl
in
a
blue
homespun
gown
had
seized
him
with
one
hand
and
katie
with
the
other
and
drawn
them
both
into
the
room
into
the
general
whir
and
of
wheels
merry
faces
and
still
merrier
voices
it
was
elspie
katie
youngest
sister
katie
special
charge
and
care
when
she
was
a
baby
and
now
her
special
pet
the
greatest
desire
of
katie
heart
was
to
have
elspie
with
her
in
charlottetown
but
the
father
and
mother
would
not
consent
donald
stood
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
did
not
know
it
but
from
the
moment
his
eyes
first
fell
on
elspie
face
they
had
followed
it
as
iron
follows
the
magnet
were
there
ever
such
sweet
gray
eyes
in
the
world
and
such
a
pink
and
white
skin
and
hair
yellow
as
gold
and
what
oh
what
did
she
wear
tucked
in
at
the
belt
of
her
white
apron
but
a
sprig
of
heather
pink
heather
true
genuine
actual
pink
heather
such
as
donald
had
not
seen
for
many
a
year
no
wonder
the
eyes
of
the
captain
of
the
heather
bell
followed
that
spray
of
pink
heather
wherever
it
went
flitting
about
from
place
to
place
never
long
in
one
for
it
was
now
time
for
dinner
and
donald
and
the
old
people
were
soon
seated
at
a
small
table
by
themselves
not
to
embarrass
the
young
girls
and
elspie
and
katie
together
served
the
dinner
and
though
elspie
never
once
came
to
the
small
table
yet
did
donald
see
every
motion
she
made
and
hear
every
note
of
her
lark
voice
he
did
not
mistake
what
had
happened
to
him
inexperienced
man
as
he
was
he
knew
that
at
last
he
had
got
a
wound
a
life
wound
if
it
were
not
healed
and
the
consciousness
of
it
struck
him
more
and
more
dumb
till
his
presence
was
like
a
damper
on
the
festivities
so
much
so
that
when
at
three
in
the
afternoon
he
and
katie
took
their
departure
the
door
had
no
more
than
closed
on
them
before
elspie
exclaimed
pettishly
indeed
i
wish
katie
left
cousin
donald
behind
i
do
know
what
it
is
she
thinks
so
much
of
him
for
she
always
sayin
there
none
like
him
an
it
lucky
it
true
the
great
glowerin
steeple
o
a
man
with
no
word
in
his
mouth
and
the
young
maidens
all
agreed
with
her
it
was
a
strange
thing
for
a
man
to
come
and
go
like
that
with
nothing
to
say
for
himself
they
said
and
he
so
handsome
too
handsome
cried
elspie
is
it
handsome
the
face
all
a
spatter
with
the
color
of
the
hair
he
nice
eyes
of
his
own
but
his
deesgustin
which
speech
if
donald
had
overheard
it
would
have
caused
that
there
should
never
have
been
this
story
to
tell
but
luckily
donald
did
not
all
that
he
bore
away
from
the
mccloud
that
june
morning
was
a
picture
of
a
face
and
flitting
figure
and
the
sound
in
his
ears
of
a
voice
a
picture
and
a
sound
which
he
was
destined
to
see
and
hear
all
his
life
he
scarcely
spoke
on
his
way
back
to
the
boat
and
katie
perplexed
herself
vainly
trying
to
account
for
his
silence
it
must
be
she
thought
that
he
had
been
vexed
by
the
sight
of
so
many
girls
and
the
sound
of
their
idle
chatter
he
would
have
liked
it
better
if
nobody
but
the
family
had
been
at
home
what
a
shame
for
a
man
to
live
alone
as
he
did
and
get
into
such
unsocial
ways
he
grew
more
and
more
averse
to
society
each
year
now
if
he
were
only
married
and
had
a
bright
home
where
people
came
and
went
with
a
bit
of
a
tea
now
and
then
how
good
it
would
be
for
him
take
the
stiffness
out
of
his
ways
and
make
him
more
as
he
used
to
be
fifteen
or
even
ten
years
ago
and
so
the
good
katie
went
on
in
her
placid
mind
trotting
along
silently
by
his
side
waiting
for
him
to
speak
where
did
she
get
the
heather
what
exclaimed
katie
the
irrelevant
question
sounded
like
the
speech
of
one
talking
in
his
sleep
oh
she
continued
ye
mean
elspie
ay
said
donald
she
a
bit
of
heather
in
her
belt
the
true
heather
not
sticks
like
yon
pointing
a
contemptuous
finger
toward
katie
bonnet
where
did
she
get
it
mother
always
the
heather
growing
in
the
house
answered
katie
she
says
she
homesick
unless
she
sees
it
it
was
grandmother
brought
it
over
in
the
first
and
it
never
been
let
die
out
my
mother
the
same
said
donald
it
the
first
blossom
i
remember
an
i
thinking
it
will
be
the
last
he
continued
gazing
at
katie
absently
but
his
face
did
not
look
as
if
it
were
absently
he
gazed
there
was
a
glow
on
his
cheeks
and
an
intense
expression
in
his
eyes
which
katie
had
never
seen
there
they
warmed
her
heart
yes
she
said
one
can
never
forget
what
one
has
loved
in
the
youth
true
katie
true
there
nothing
like
one
own
and
earliest
replied
donald
full
of
his
new
and
thrilling
emotion
and
as
he
said
it
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
hold
of
katie
as
if
they
were
boy
and
girl
together
many
the
time
i
raced
wi
ye
this
way
katie
he
said
affectionately
ay
when
i
was
a
wee
thing
an
ye
always
let
go
my
hand
at
last
and
pretended
i
could
outrin
ye
laughed
katie
blissful
tears
filling
her
eyes
what
a
happy
day
was
this
had
it
not
been
an
inspiration
to
bring
donald
back
to
the
old
katie
was
sure
it
had
she
was
filled
with
sweet
reveries
and
so
silent
on
the
way
home
that
her
merry
friends
joked
her
unmercifully
about
her
long
walk
inland
with
the
captain
it
was
late
in
the
night
or
rather
it
was
early
the
next
morning
when
the
heather
bell
reached
her
wharf
i
go
up
with
ye
katie
said
donald
it
not
decent
for
ye
to
go
alone
and
when
he
bade
her
he
looked
in
her
face
and
said
but
it
a
lonely
house
for
ye
to
come
to
katie
an
not
a
soul
but
yourself
in
it
and
he
held
her
hand
in
his
affectionately
as
a
cousin
might
katie
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
in
her
bosom
at
these
words
but
she
answered
gravely
yes
it
was
sorely
lonely
at
first
an
i
wearied
myself
out
to
get
them
to
give
me
elspie
to
learn
the
business
wi
me
but
i
more
used
to
it
now
that
is
what
i
was
thinkin
said
donald
that
if
the
two
o
ye
were
here
together
ye
not
be
so
lonely
would
she
not
like
to
come
ay
that
would
she
replied
the
unconscious
katie
she
pines
to
be
with
me
i
more
her
mother
than
the
mother
herself
but
they
never
consent
she
bonny
said
donald
i
not
seen
her
since
she
was
little
she
as
good
as
she
is
bonny
said
katie
warmly
and
that
was
the
last
word
between
katie
and
donald
that
night
as
good
as
she
is
bonny
it
rang
in
donald
ears
like
a
refrain
of
heavenly
music
as
he
strode
away
as
good
as
she
is
bonny
and
how
good
must
that
be
she
could
not
be
as
good
as
she
was
bonny
for
she
was
the
bonniest
lass
that
ever
drew
breath
gray
eyes
and
golden
hair
and
pink
cheeks
and
pink
heather
all
mingled
in
donald
dreams
that
night
in
fantastic
and
impossible
combinations
and
more
than
once
he
waked
in
terror
with
the
sweat
standing
on
his
forehead
from
some
nightmare
fancy
of
danger
to
the
heather
bell
and
to
elspie
both
being
inextricably
entangled
together
in
his
vision
the
visions
did
not
fade
with
the
day
they
pursued
donald
and
haunted
his
and
his
uprising
he
tried
to
shake
them
off
drive
them
away
for
when
he
came
to
think
the
thing
over
soberly
he
called
himself
an
old
fool
to
be
thus
going
daft
about
a
child
like
elspie
barely
twenty
at
the
most
and
me
forty
she
not
look
at
an
old
fellow
like
me
and
would
be
like
a
sin
if
she
did
said
donald
to
himself
over
and
over
again
but
it
did
no
good
as
good
as
she
is
bonny
bonny
bonny
rang
in
his
ears
and
the
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
and
merry
smile
floated
before
his
eyes
there
was
no
help
for
it
since
the
world
began
there
have
been
but
two
roads
out
of
this
sort
of
mystic
maze
in
which
donald
now
found
himself
lost
but
two
roads
one
bright
with
joy
one
dark
with
sorrow
and
which
road
should
it
be
donald
fate
to
travel
must
be
for
the
child
elspie
to
say
after
a
few
days
of
bootless
striving
with
himself
during
which
time
he
had
spent
more
hours
with
katie
than
he
had
for
a
year
before
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
him
to
see
in
her
face
the
subtle
likeness
to
elspie
and
to
hear
her
talk
about
plans
of
bringing
her
to
charlottetown
for
a
visit
if
nothing
more
after
a
few
days
of
this
captain
donald
one
saturday
afternoon
sailing
past
orwell
head
suddenly
ran
into
the
inlet
where
he
had
taken
the
picnic
party
and
mooring
the
heather
bell
at
spruce
wharf
announced
to
his
astonished
mate
that
he
should
lie
by
there
till
monday
it
was
a
bold
step
of
captain
donald
but
he
was
not
a
man
for
ways
in
anything
and
he
had
said
grimly
to
himself
that
this
matter
must
be
ended
one
way
or
the
other
either
he
would
win
the
child
or
lose
her
he
would
know
which
girls
had
loved
men
twenty
years
older
than
themselves
and
girls
might
again
the
sunday
passed
off
better
than
his
utmost
hopes
everybody
except
elspie
was
cordially
glad
to
see
him
visitors
were
not
so
common
at
the
orwell
head
that
they
could
fail
of
welcome
the
mccloud
boys
were
thankful
to
hear
all
that
donald
had
to
tell
and
with
the
old
father
and
mother
he
had
always
been
a
prime
favorite
it
had
been
a
sore
disappointment
to
them
as
year
after
year
went
by
to
see
that
there
seemed
no
likelihood
of
his
becoming
katie
husband
as
the
day
wore
on
even
elspie
relaxed
a
little
from
her
indifferent
attention
to
him
and
began
to
perceive
that
spite
of
the
odious
freckles
he
was
as
the
girls
had
said
a
handsome
man
partly
because
of
this
and
partly
from
innate
coquetry
she
said
when
he
was
taking
leave
ye
not
be
comin
again
for
another
year
maybe
ye
see
then
laughed
donald
with
a
sudden
wise
impulse
to
refrain
from
giving
the
reply
which
sprang
to
his
lips
if
ye
ask
me
and
from
the
same
wise
strangely
wise
impulse
he
curbed
his
desire
to
go
again
the
next
sunday
and
the
next
not
until
three
weeks
had
passed
did
he
go
and
then
elspie
was
clearly
and
unmistakably
glad
to
see
him
this
was
all
donald
wanted
i
win
her
the
bonny
thing
he
said
to
himself
an
i
not
be
long
either
and
he
was
right
a
girl
would
have
been
hard
indeed
that
would
not
have
been
touched
by
the
beaming
tender
face
which
donald
wore
now
that
hope
lighted
it
up
his
masterful
bearing
too
was
a
pleasure
to
the
spirited
elspie
who
had
no
liking
for
milksops
and
had
sent
off
more
than
one
lover
because
he
came
crawling
too
humbly
to
her
feet
elspie
had
none
of
the
gentle
quiet
blood
which
ran
in
katie
veins
she
had
even
been
called
firebrand
in
her
younger
childish
days
so
hot
was
her
temper
so
hasty
her
tongue
but
the
firm
rule
of
the
scottish
household
and
the
pressure
of
the
stern
scotch
calvinism
preached
in
their
kirk
had
brought
her
well
under
her
own
control
eh
but
the
bonny
lass
has
hersel
well
in
hand
thought
the
admiring
donald
more
than
once
as
he
saw
her
in
some
family
discussion
or
controversy
keep
silence
with
flushing
cheeks
when
sharp
words
rose
to
her
tongue
all
this
time
katie
was
plodding
away
at
her
millinery
inexpressibly
cheered
by
donald
new
friendliness
he
came
often
to
see
her
and
told
her
with
the
greatest
frankness
of
his
visits
at
the
farm
he
would
take
her
some
day
he
said
the
trouble
was
he
could
never
be
sure
beforehand
when
it
would
answer
for
him
to
stop
there
katie
sunned
herself
in
this
new
familiar
intercourse
and
the
thought
of
donald
running
up
to
the
old
farm
of
a
sunday
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
brothers
going
home
in
the
contentment
of
these
thoughts
she
grew
younger
and
prettier
began
to
look
as
she
did
at
twenty
and
donald
gazing
scrutinizingly
in
her
face
one
day
seeking
as
he
was
always
doing
for
stray
glimpses
of
resemblance
to
elspie
saw
this
change
and
impulsively
told
her
of
it
but
ye
growin
young
katie
d
know
it
young
and
bonny
my
girl
and
katie
listened
to
the
words
with
such
sweet
joy
she
feared
her
face
would
tell
too
much
and
put
up
her
hands
to
hide
it
crying
ah
tryin
to
make
me
silly
you
donald
with
such
flatterin
we
old
donald
you
an
me
she
added
with
a
guilty
little
undercurrent
of
thought
in
her
mind
d
mind
that
i
was
thirty
last
month
ay
replied
donald
gloomily
his
face
darkening
ay
i
mind
by
the
same
token
i
forty
it
no
need
ye
have
to
be
callin
yersel
old
but
i
old
an
no
mistake
the
thought
as
katie
had
put
it
had
been
gall
and
wormwood
to
him
if
katie
thought
him
old
what
must
he
seem
to
elspie
it
was
early
in
june
that
elspie
had
had
the
to
which
katie
had
brought
the
unwelcome
donald
the
summer
sped
past
but
a
faster
summer
than
any
reckoned
on
the
calendar
of
months
and
days
was
speeding
in
elspie
heart
such
great
love
as
donald
reaches
and
warms
its
object
as
inevitably
as
the
heat
of
a
fire
warms
those
near
it
early
in
june
the
and
before
the
last
flax
was
pulled
early
in
september
elspie
knew
that
she
was
restless
till
donald
came
glad
when
he
was
by
her
side
and
strangely
sorry
when
he
went
away
still
she
was
not
ready
to
admit
to
herself
that
it
was
anything
more
than
her
natural
liking
for
any
pleasant
friend
who
broke
in
on
the
lonely
monotony
of
the
farm
life
the
final
drying
of
the
flax
which
is
an
important
crop
on
most
of
the
prince
edward
island
farms
is
put
off
until
autumn
after
its
first
drying
in
the
fields
where
it
grew
it
is
stored
in
bundles
under
cover
till
all
the
other
summer
work
is
done
and
autumn
brings
leisure
then
the
flax
camp
as
it
is
called
is
built
a
big
house
of
spruce
boughs
walls
flat
roof
all
of
the
green
spruce
boughs
thick
enough
to
keep
out
rain
this
is
usually
in
the
heart
of
a
spruce
grove
thither
the
bundles
of
flax
are
carried
and
stacked
in
piles
in
the
centre
of
the
inclosure
a
slow
fire
is
lighted
and
above
this
on
a
frame
of
slats
the
stalks
of
flax
are
laid
for
their
last
drying
it
is
a
difficult
and
dangerous
process
to
keep
the
fire
hot
enough
and
not
too
hot
to
shift
and
turn
and
lift
the
flax
at
the
right
moment
sometimes
only
a
sudden
flinging
of
moist
earth
upon
the
fire
saves
it
from
blazing
up
into
the
flax
and
sometimes
one
careless
second
oversight
loses
the
whole
flax
house
all
in
a
light
blaze
and
gone
in
a
breath
the
mcclouds
flax
camp
had
been
built
in
the
edge
of
the
spruce
grove
where
the
picnickers
had
held
their
dance
and
on
that
june
day
memorable
to
donald
and
elspie
and
katie
it
was
well
filled
with
flax
in
the
drying
of
which
nobody
was
more
interested
than
elspie
she
had
big
schemes
for
spinning
and
weaving
in
the
coming
winter
a
whole
piece
of
linen
she
had
promised
to
katie
and
a
piece
for
herself
and
as
elspie
thought
it
over
maybe
a
good
many
more
pieces
than
one
she
might
require
for
herself
before
spring
who
knew
it
was
october
now
and
many
a
sunday
evening
had
elspie
walked
with
donald
alone
down
to
spruce
wharf
and
lingered
there
watching
the
last
curl
of
steam
from
the
heather
bell
as
she
rounded
the
point
bearing
donald
away
elspie
could
not
doubt
why
donald
came
soon
she
would
wonder
why
he
came
and
went
so
many
times
silent
that
is
silent
in
words
eloquent
of
eye
and
hand
even
the
touch
of
his
hand
was
like
a
promise
no
one
was
defter
and
more
successful
in
this
handling
of
the
flax
over
the
fire
than
elspie
it
had
sometimes
happened
that
she
with
the
help
of
one
brother
had
dried
the
whole
crop
it
was
not
thought
safe
for
one
person
to
work
at
it
alone
for
fear
of
accident
with
the
fire
but
it
fell
out
on
this
october
afternoon
a
saturday
that
elspie
feeling
sure
of
donald
being
on
his
way
to
spend
the
sunday
with
her
had
walked
down
to
the
wharf
to
meet
him
seeing
no
signs
of
the
boat
she
went
back
to
the
flax
camp
lighted
the
fire
and
began
to
spread
the
flax
on
the
slats
there
was
not
much
more
left
to
be
dried
not
more
than
three
hours
work
in
all
she
said
to
herself
eh
but
i
like
to
have
done
with
it
before
the
sabbath
and
she
fell
to
work
with
a
will
so
briskly
to
work
that
she
did
not
realize
how
time
was
flying
did
not
strangest
of
all
hear
the
letting
off
of
steam
when
the
heather
bell
moored
at
the
wharf
and
she
was
still
busily
turning
and
lifting
and
separating
the
stalks
of
flax
bending
low
over
the
frame
heated
hurrying
her
whole
heart
in
her
work
when
donald
came
striding
up
the
field
from
the
wharf
striding
at
his
greatest
pace
for
he
was
disturbed
at
not
finding
elspie
at
the
landing
to
meet
him
he
turned
his
head
toward
the
spruce
grove
thinking
vaguely
of
the
june
picnic
and
what
had
come
of
his
walking
away
from
the
dance
that
morning
when
suddenly
a
great
column
of
smoke
and
fire
rolled
up
from
the
grove
and
in
the
same
second
came
piercing
shrieks
in
voice
the
grove
was
only
a
few
rods
away
but
it
seemed
to
donald
an
eternity
before
he
reached
the
spot
to
see
not
only
the
spruce
boughs
and
flax
on
fire
but
elspie
tossing
up
her
arms
like
one
crazed
her
gown
all
ablaze
the
brave
foolish
girl
at
the
first
blazing
of
the
stalks
on
the
slats
had
darted
into
the
corner
of
the
house
and
snatched
an
armful
of
the
piled
flax
there
to
save
it
but
as
she
passed
the
flaming
centre
the
whole
sheaf
she
carried
had
caught
fire
also
and
in
a
twinkling
of
an
eye
had
blazed
up
around
her
head
and
when
she
dropped
it
had
blazed
up
again
fiercer
than
ever
around
her
feet
with
a
groan
donald
seized
her
the
flames
leaped
on
him
too
as
if
to
wrestle
with
him
his
brown
beard
crackled
his
hair
but
he
fought
through
it
all
throwing
elspie
on
the
ground
he
rolled
her
over
and
over
crying
aloud
oh
my
darlin
if
i
break
your
sweet
bones
it
is
better
than
the
fire
and
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
break
her
bones
so
fiercely
he
rolled
her
over
and
over
tearing
off
his
woollen
coat
to
smother
the
fire
beating
it
with
his
tartan
cap
stamping
it
with
his
knees
and
feet
oh
my
darlin
make
yourself
easy
i
save
ye
i
save
ye
if
i
die
for
it
he
cried
and
through
the
smoke
and
the
fire
and
the
terror
elspie
answered
back
i
not
leave
ye
my
donald
we
gettin
it
under
and
with
her
own
scorched
hands
she
pulled
the
down
over
the
smouldering
bits
of
flax
and
tore
off
her
burning
garments
not
a
coward
thread
in
her
whole
body
had
little
elspie
and
in
less
time
than
the
story
could
ever
be
told
all
was
over
and
safely
and
there
they
sat
on
the
ground
the
two
locked
in
each
arms
donald
beard
gone
and
much
of
his
hair
elspie
pretty
golden
hair
also
blackened
burned
it
was
the
first
thing
donald
saw
after
he
made
sure
danger
was
past
laying
his
hand
on
her
head
he
said
with
a
he
was
hysterical
now
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
oh
your
bonny
hair
my
darlin
it
all
scorched
away
it
grow
said
elspie
looking
up
in
his
eyes
archly
her
head
was
on
his
shoulder
and
she
nestled
closer
then
she
burst
into
tears
and
laughter
together
crying
oh
donald
it
was
for
you
i
was
callin
did
ye
hear
me
i
said
to
myself
when
the
fire
took
hold
god
send
donald
to
save
me
an
he
sent
me
my
darlin
answered
donald
ye
are
my
own
darlin
say
it
elspie
say
it
he
continued
oh
ye
bonny
bairn
but
loved
ye
like
death
since
the
first
day
i
set
eyes
on
your
bonny
face
say
ye
my
darlin
but
he
knew
it
without
her
saying
a
word
and
the
whispered
yes
donald
i
your
darlin
if
you
want
me
did
not
make
him
any
surer
there
was
a
great
outcrying
and
trembling
of
hearts
at
the
when
donald
and
elspie
appeared
in
this
sorry
plight
of
torn
and
burned
clothes
blackened
faces
scorched
and
singed
hair
but
thankfulness
soon
swept
away
all
other
emotions
thankfulness
and
a
great
joy
too
for
donald
second
word
was
turning
to
the
old
father
an
it
is
my
own
that
i
saved
she
gien
hersel
to
me
for
all
time
an
ask
for
your
blessin
on
us
without
any
waitin
tears
filled
the
mother
eyes
she
thought
of
another
daughter
a
dire
instinct
smote
her
of
woe
to
katie
ay
donald
she
said
it
a
good
day
to
us
to
see
ye
enter
the
house
as
a
son
but
i
never
thought
o
she
stopped
donald
quick
consciousness
imagined
part
of
what
she
had
on
her
mind
no
he
said
half
sad
in
the
midst
of
his
joy
o
course

did
an
i
wonder

like

bairn

no
light
love

bear
her

tellin
katie
on
the
morrow
said
the
unconscious
elspie
ay
ay
replied
the
equally
unconscious
donald
an
she
be
main
glad
o
it
a
hundred
times
in
the
summer
that
she
been
how
she
longed
to
have

the
town
wi

an
now

comin
comin
soon
oh
my
bonny
i
make
a
good
home
for
ye
both
the
same
my
own
too
for
always
the
mother
gazed
earnestly
at
donald
could
it
be
that
he
was
so
unaware
of
katie
heart
donald
she
said
suddenly
i
go
down
wi
ye
if
ye
take
me
i
been
wantin
to
go
there
a
many
things
i
to
do
in
the
town
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
thus
save
katie
the
shock
of
hearing
the
news
first
from
donald
lips
it
was
well
she
did
when
with
stammering
lips
and
she
hardly
knew
in
what
words
she
finally
broke
it
to
katie
that
donald
had
asked
elspie
to
be
his
wife
and
that
elspie
loved
him
and
they
would
soon
be
married
katie
stared
into
her
face
for
a
moment
with
wide
vacant
eyes
as
if
paralyzed
by
some
vision
of
terror
then
turning
white
she
gasped
out
mother
no
word
more
none
was
necessary
ay
my
bairn
i
know
said
the
mother
with
a
trembling
voice
an
i
came
mysel
that
no
other
should
tell
ye
a
long
silence
followed
broken
only
by
an
occasional
shuddering
sigh
from
katie
not
a
tear
in
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
as
scarlet
as
they
had
been
white
a
few
moments
before
the
look
on
her
face
was
terrifying
will
it
kill
ye
bairn
sobbed
the
mother
at
last
do
look
so
it
must
be
borne
my
bairn
it
must
be
borne
it
was
a
shrill
voice
unlike
katie
which
replied
ay
i
bear
it
it
must
be
borne
there
none
knows
it
but
you
mother
she
added
with
a
shade
of
relief
in
the
tone
an
never
will
if
ye
brave
bairn
answered
the
mother
it
was
the
day
of
the
picnic
cried
katie
not
i
remember
he
said
she
was
bonny
ay
was
then
replied
the
mother
so
sorely
torn
between
her
love
for
the
two
daughters
between
whom
had
fallen
this
terrible
sword
ay
it
was
then
he
says
she
has
not
been
out
of
his
mind
by
the
night
or
by
the
day
since
it
katie
shivered
and
it
was
i
brought
him
she
said
with
a
tearless
sob
bitterer
than
any
loud
weeping
ye
be
goin
back
the
night
she
added
drearily
i
bide
if
ye
want
me
said
the
mother
i
better
alone
mother
said
katie
her
voice
for
the
first
time
faltering
i
bear
it
never
fear
me
mother
but
i
best
alone
for
a
bit
ye
give
my
warm
love
to
elspie
an
send
her
down
here
to
me
to

till

if

i
do
mother

much
on
yer
strength
bairn
asked
the
now
weeping
mother
i
rather

give
way
like

no
cried
katie
impatiently
each
one
has
his
own
way
mother
let
me
have
mine
i
work
for
donald
and
elspie
all
i
can
ye
know
she
was
always
like
my
own
bairn
more
than
a
sister
the
quicker
she
comes
the
better
for
me
mother
it
be
all
over
then
eh
but
she
be
a
bonny
bride
and
at
these
words
katie
tears
at
last
flowed
there
there
bairn
have
out
the
tears
they
healin
to
grief
exclaimed
her
mother
folding
her
arms
tight
around
her
and
drawing
her
head
down
on
her
shoulder
as
she
had
done
in
her
babyhood
katie
was
right
when
she
had
elspie
by
her
side
and
was
busily
at
work
in
helping
on
all
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
the
worst
was
over
there
was
a
strange
blending
of
pang
and
pleasure
in
the
work
katie
wondered
at
herself
but
it
grew
clearer
and
clearer
to
her
each
day
that
since
donald
could
not
be
hers
she
was
glad
he
was
elspie
if
he
married
a
stranger
it
would
ha
broke
my
heart
far
worse
far
worse
she
said
many
a
time
to
herself
as
she
sat
patiently
stitching
stitching
on
elspie
bridal
clothes
he
my
own
in
a
way
after
a
so
long
he
my
brother
there
nobody
can
rob
me
o
that
and
the
sweet
light
of
unselfish
devotion
beamed
more
and
more
in
her
countenance
till
even
the
mother
that
bore
her
was
deceived
and
said
in
her
heart
that
katie
could
not
have
been
so
very
much
in
love
with
donald
after
all
there
was
one
incident
which
for
a
few
moments
sorely
tested
the
spray
of
white
heather
blossom
which
she
had
worn
to
the
june
picnic
she
had
on
the
next
day
put
back
in
her
box
of
flowers
for
sale
hoping
that
she
might
yet
find
a
customer
for
it
the
delicate
bells
were
not
injured
either
in
shape
or
color
it
was
a
shame
to
lose
it
for
one
day
wear
thought
the
thrifty
katie
and
most
surely
she
herself
would
never
wear
it
again
she
could
not
even
see
it
without
a
flush
of
mortification
as
she
recalled
donald
contempt
for
it
the
privileged
elspie
rummaging
among
all
katie
stores
old
and
new
spied
this
white
heather
cluster
one
day
and
snatching
it
up
exclaimed
the
very
thing
for
my
weddin
bonnet
katie
i
have
it
in
the
bride
o
the
master
o
the
bell
should
be
wed
with
the
heather
bloom
on
her
katie
face
flushed
it
been
worn
elspie
she
said
i
had
it
in
a
bonnet
o
my
own
do
ye
remember
i
wore
it
to
the
picnic
an
then
it
didna
suit
an
i
put
it
back
in
the
box
it
not
fit
for
ye
i
a
bunch
o
lilies
o
the
valley
better
no
i
have
this
pursued
elspie
it
as
white
the
driven
snow
an
not
hurt
at
all
i
sure
donald
like
it
better
than
all
the
other
flowers
i
the
town
indeed
then
he
wo
said
katie
sharply
on
which
elspie
turned
upon
her
with
a
flashing
eye
and
said
an
which
be
knowin
best
do
ye
think
what
is
it
ye
mean
nothing
said
katie
meekly
only
he
said
that
day
i
the
bonnet
on
it
was
no
more
than
sticks
an
not
like
the
true
heather
at
all
all
he
knows
then
ye
see
he
not
say
it
looks
like
sticks
when
it
on
the
bonnet
i
goin
to
church
in
retorted
elspie
dancing
to
the
and
holding
the
white
heather
bells
high
up
against
her
golden
curls
it
the
only
flower
in
all
yer
boxes
i
want
katie
and
ye
not
grudge
it
to
me
will
ye
dear
and
the
sparkling
elspie
threw
herself
on
the
floor
by
katie
and
flung
her
arms
across
her
knees
looking
up
into
her
face
with
a
wilful
loving
smile
no
wonder
donald
loves
her
so
the
bonny
thing
thought
katie
god
knows
i
grudge
ye
nothing
on
earth
elspie
she
said
in
a
voice
so
earnest
that
elspie
looked
wonderingly
at
her
is
it
a
very
dear
flower
sister
she
said
penitently
does
it
cost
too
much
money
for
elspie
no
bairn
it
not
too
dear
said
katie
herself
again
the
lilies
were
dearer
but
ye
have
the
heather
an
welcome
if
ye
will
an
i
doubt
not
it
look
all
right
in
donald
eyes
when
he
sees
it
this
time
it
was
indeed
a
good
home
that
donald
made
for
his
wife
and
her
sister
he
was
better
to
do
in
worldly
goods
than
they
had
supposed
his
long
years
of
seclusion
from
society
had
been
years
of
thrift
and
prosperity
no
more
for
katie
donald
would
not
hear
of
it
so
she
was
driven
to
busy
herself
with
the
house
keeping
from
elspie
willing
and
eager
hands
all
the
harder
tasks
and
laying
up
stores
of
linen
and
wool
for
future
use
in
the
family
it
was
a
marvel
how
content
katie
found
herself
as
the
winter
flew
by
the
wedding
had
taken
place
at
christmas
and
the
two
sisters
and
donald
had
gone
together
from
the
church
to
donald
new
house
where
in
a
day
or
two
everything
had
settled
into
peaceful
grooves
of
simple
industrious
habit
as
if
they
had
been
there
all
their
lives
donald
happiness
was
of
the
deep
and
silent
kind
elspie
did
not
realize
the
extent
of
it
a
more
demonstrative
lover
would
have
found
heartier
response
and
more
appreciation
from
her
but
she
was
a
loyal
loving
contented
little
wife
and
there
could
not
have
been
found
in
all
charlottetown
a
happier
household
to
the
eye
than
was
donald
for
the
first
three
months
after
his
marriage
then
a
cloud
settled
on
it
for
some
inexplicable
reason
the
blooming
elspie
who
had
never
had
a
day
illness
in
her
life
drooped
in
the
first
approach
of
the
burden
of
motherhood
a
strange
presentiment
also
seized
her
after
the
first
brief
gladness
at
the
thought
of
holding
a
child
of
her
own
in
her
arms
she
became
overwhelmed
with
a
melancholy
certainty
of
her
own
death
i
never
live
to
see
it
katie
she
said
again
and
again
it
be
your
bairn
an
not
mine
ye
never
give
it
up
katie
promise
me
ye
take
care
of
it
all
your
life
promise
and
katie
terrified
by
her
earnestness
promised
everything
she
asked
all
the
while
striving
to
reassure
her
that
her
fears
were
needless
no
medicines
did
elspie
good
mind
and
body
alike
reacted
on
each
other
she
failed
hour
by
hour
till
the
last
and
when
her
time
of
trial
came
the
sad
presentiment
fulfilled
itself
and
she
died
in
giving
birth
to
her
babe
when
katie
brought
the
child
to
the
stunned
and
stricken
donald
saying
will
ye
not
look
at
him
donald
it
is
as
fine
a
was
ever
seen
he
pushed
her
away
saying
in
a
hoarse
whisper
never
let
me
see
its
face
she
said
it
was
to
be
your
bairn
and
not
hers
take
it
and
go
i
never
look
on
it
donald
was
out
of
his
reason
when
he
spoke
these
words
and
for
long
after
they
bore
with
him
tenderly
and
patiently
and
did
as
they
could
for
the
best
katie
the
wan
and
katie
being
the
chief
adviser
and
planner
of
all
elspie
body
was
carried
home
and
buried
near
the
spruce
grove
in
a
little
copse
of
young
spruces
which
donald
pointed
out
this
was
the
only
wish
he
expressed
about
anything
katie
took
the
baby
with
her
to
the
old
homestead
she
dared
not
try
to
rear
it
without
her
mothers
help
it
was
many
months
before
donald
came
to
the
farm
this
seemed
strange
to
all
except
katie
to
her
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
and
she
grew
impatient
with
all
who
thought
otherwise
i
feel
that
way
mysel
she
repeated
again
and
again
he
come
when
he
can
but
it
be
long
first
ye
none
of
ye
know
what
a
love
it
was
he
in
his
heart
for
elspie
when
at
last
donald
came
the
child
the
little
donald
was
just
able
to
creep
a
chubby
little
creature
already
bearing
the
stamp
and
likeness
of
his
mother
beauty
at
the
first
sight
of
his
face
donald
staggered
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
turned
away
then
looking
again
he
stretched
out
his
arms
took
the
baby
in
them
and
kissed
him
convulsively
over
and
over
katie
stood
by
looking
on
silently
weeping
he
like
her
she
said
ay
said
donald
the
healing
had
begun
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
is
of
all
the
bible
prophecies
the
one
oftenest
fulfilled
it
soon
grew
to
be
chiefest
pleasure
to
be
with
his
boy
and
he
found
more
and
more
irksome
the
bonds
of
business
which
permitted
him
so
few
intervals
of
leisure
to
visit
the
farm
at
last
one
day
he
said
to
katie
katie
could
ye
make
your
mind
up
to
come
up
to
charlottetown
get
ye
a
good
house
an
ye
could
have
who
ye
like
to
live
wi
ye
like
one
hungry
all
the
time
i
out
o
reach
o
the
little
lad
katie
eyes
fell
she
did
not
know
what
to
reply
i
do
not
know
donald
she
faltered
it
hard
for
you
having
him
away
but
this
is
my
home
now
donald
i
a
dread
o
leavin
it
and
there
is
nobody
i
know
who
could
come
to
live
with
me
a
strange
thought
shot
through
donald
brain
katie
he
said
then
paused
something
in
the
tone
startled
katie
she
lifted
her
eyes
read
in
his
the
thought
which
had
made
the
tone
so
significant
to
her
ear
unconsciously
she
cried
out
at
the
sight
oh
donald
ay
katie
he
said
slowly
with
a
grave
tenderness
why
might
not
i
come
and
live
wi
ye
are
ye
not
the
mother
o
my
child
did
she
not
give
him
to
ye
with
her
own
lips
an
how
could
ye
have
him
without
me
i
think
she
must
ha
meant
it
so
let
me
come
katie
it
was
an
unimpassioned
wooing
but
any
other
would
have
repelled
katie
sense
of
loyalty
and
truth
have
ye
love
for
me
donald
she
said
searchingly
all
the
love
left
in
me
is
for
the
little
lad
and
for
you
katie
answered
donald
i
not
deceive
you
katie
it
but
a
broken
man
i
am
but
i
always
loved
ye
katie
i
be
a
good
man
t
ye
lass
come
and
be
the
little
lad
mother
and
let
me
live
wi
my
own
once
more
will
ye
come
as
he
said
these
words
he
stretched
out
his
arms
toward
katie
and
she
trembling
afraid
to
be
glad
shadowed
by
the
sad
past
yet
trusting
in
the
future
crept
into
them
and
was
folded
close
to
the
heart
she
had
so
faithfully
loved
all
her
life
i
promised
elspie
she
whispered
that
i
never
never
give
him
to
another
ay
said
donald
as
he
kissed
her
he
your
bairn
my
katie
be
content
wi
me
katie
yes
donald
if
i
make
you
content
she
replied
and
a
look
of
heavenly
peace
spread
over
her
face
the
next
morning
katie
went
alone
to
elspie
grave
it
seemed
to
her
that
only
there
could
she
venture
to
look
her
new
future
in
the
face
as
she
knelt
by
the
low
mound
her
tears
falling
fast
she
murmured
eh
my
bonny
elspie
ye
the
best
o
his
love
but
it
me
that
be
doin
for
him
till
i
die
an
that
better
than
a
the
love
dandy
steve
everything
in
this
world
is
relative
and
nothing
more
so
than
the
significance
of
the
same
word
in
different
localities
if
dandy
steve
had
walked
broadway
in
the
same
clothes
which
he
habitually
wore
in
the
adirondack
wilderness
not
only
would
nobody
have
called
him
a
dandy
but
every
one
would
have
smiled
sarcastically
at
the
suggestion
of
that
epithet
being
applied
to
him
nevertheless
dandy
steve
was
the
name
by
which
he
was
familiarly
known
all
through
the
saranac
region
and
judging
by
the
wilderness
standard
the
adjective
was
not
undeserved
no
such
flannel
shirts
no
such
jaunty
felt
hats
no
such
neckties
had
ever
been
worn
by
adirondack
guides
as
dandy
steve
habitually
wore
and
as
for
his
trousers
they
would
not
have
disgraced
a
sioux
chief
always
of
the
softest
and
yellowest
skins
always
daintily
made
the
seams
set
full
of
leather
fringes
and
sometimes
marked
by
lines
of
delicate
embroidery
in
white
quills
there
were
those
who
said
that
dandy
steve
had
an
indian
wife
somewhere
on
the
upper
saranac
but
nobody
knew
and
it
would
have
been
a
bold
man
who
asked
an
intrusive
question
of
dandy
steve
or
ventured
on
any
impertinent
jesting
about
his
private
affairs
certain
it
was
that
none
but
indian
hands
embroidered
the
fine
buckskins
he
wore
but
then
there
were
such
buckskins
for
sale
perhaps
he
bought
them
a
man
who
would
spend
the
money
he
did
for
neckties
and
fine
flannel
shirts
would
not
stop
at
any
extravagance
in
the
price
of
trousers
the
buckskins
however
were
not
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
there
was
a
tale
of
a
brilliant
red
shawl
a
woman
shawl
and
a
pair
of
silver
bangles
once
seen
in
dandy
steve
cabin
a
man
had
gone
in
upon
him
suddenly
one
evening
without
the
formality
of
knocking
such
foolish
conventionalities
were
not
in
vogue
on
the
saranac
this
was
before
steve
took
to
guiding
it
was
in
the
first
year
after
he
appeared
in
that
region
while
he
was
living
like
a
hermit
alone
or
supposed
to
be
alone
in
a
tiny
log
cabin
on
an
island
not
much
bigger
than
his
cabin
this
man
old
ben
the
oldest
guide
there
having
been
hindered
at
some
of
the
portages
and
finding
himself
too
late
to
reach
his
destination
that
night
seeing
the
glimmer
of
light
from
steve
cabin
had
rowed
to
the
island
landed
and
with
the
thoughtless
freedom
of
the
country
walked
in
at
the
door
he
was
fond
of
telling
the
story
of
his
reception
and
as
he
told
it
it
had
a
suspicious
sound
and
no
mistake
steve
was
sitting
in
a
big
before
his
table
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
was
flung
the
red
shawl
on
the
table
lay
an
open
book
and
the
silver
bangles
in
it
as
if
some
one
had
just
thrown
them
off
at
sound
of
entering
footsteps
steve
sprang
up
with
an
angry
oath
and
hastily
closing
the
book
threw
it
and
the
bangles
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
then
crowded
the
shawl
down
upon
them
into
as
small
a
compass
as
possible
his
eyes
blazed
like
lightnin
or
sharper
said
old
ben
an
i
declare
t
ye
i
was
skeered
fur
a
minut
i
thought
he
was
a
loonatic
sure
death
but
in
a
minut
more
he
was
all
right
an
there
nobody
treat
a
feller
handsomer
than
he
did
me
that
night
an
the
next
mornin
but
i
took
notice
that
the
fust
thing
he
done
was
to
heave
a
big
blanket
kind
o
careless
like
into
the
chair
an
cover
the
things
clean
up
an
then
in
a
little
while
he
says
the
whole
bundle
up
in
his
arms
just
clear
up
this
little
mess
an
give
ye
a
comfortable
chair
to
sit
in
an
he
carried
it
all
blanket
book
bracelets
shawl
an
all
into
the
next
room
an
throwed
on
the
floor
in
a
pile
in
one
corner
there
but
them
two
rooms
to
the
cabin
so
that
any
place
for
her
to
be
hid
if
so
be
there
was
any
woman
an
he
said
he
was
livin
alone
an
had
been
ever
since
he
come
an
it
was
nigh
a
year
then
since
he
come
so
i
never
know
what
to
make
on
an
i
do
suppose
there
anybody
doos
know
any
more
i
do
but
if
them
women
gear
he
had
out
there
that
night
i
hai
never
seen
any
women
gear
that
all
they
was
i
hai
no
idea
nor
how
they
got
there
but
they
was
gear
dandy
steve
is
he
could
ha
had
any
use
for
sech
a
that
let
alone
sayin
what
he
wanted
o
bracelets
on
his
arms
that
so
was
the
universal
ejaculation
of
ben
audience
when
he
reached
this
point
in
his
narrative
and
there
seemed
to
be
little
more
to
be
said
on
either
side
this
was
all
there
was
of
the
story
it
must
stand
in
each
man
mind
for
what
it
was
worth
according
to
his
individual
bias
of
interpretation
but
it
had
become
an
old
story
long
before
the
time
at
which
our
later
narrative
of
dandy
steve
history
began
so
old
in
fact
that
it
had
not
been
mentioned
for
years
until
the
events
now
about
to
be
chronicled
revived
it
in
the
minds
of
associates
and
before
the
end
of
steve
first
year
in
his
wilderness
retreat
he
had
become
as
conversant
with
every
nook
and
corner
of
its
labyrinthian
recesses
as
the
oldest
guides
in
the
region
not
a
portage
not
a
short
cut
unfamiliar
to
him
not
a
narrow
winding
brook
wide
enough
for
a
canoe
to
float
in
that
he
did
not
know
he
had
spent
all
his
days
and
many
of
his
nights
in
these
solitary
wanderings
visitors
to
the
region
grew
wonted
to
the
sight
of
the
comely
figure
in
the
slight
birch
canoe
shooting
suddenly
athwart
their
track
or
found
lying
idly
in
some
dark
and
shaded
on
the
approach
of
strangers
he
would
instantly
away
lifting
his
hat
courteously
if
there
were
ladies
in
the
boats
he
passed
otherwise
taking
no
more
note
of
the
presence
of
human
beings
than
of
that
of
the
deer
or
the
wild
fowl
on
the
water
he
was
not
a
handsome
man
but
there
was
a
something
in
his
face
at
which
all
looked
twice
men
as
well
as
women
it
was
an
unfathomable
look
partly
of
pain
partly
of
antagonism
his
eyes
habitually
sought
the
sky
yet
they
did
not
seem
to
perceive
what
they
gazed
upon
it
was
as
if
they
would
pierce
beyond
it
what
a
strange
face
was
a
common
ejaculation
on
the
part
of
those
thus
catching
glimpses
of
his
upturned
countenance
more
than
once
efforts
were
made
by
hunters
who
encountered
him
to
form
his
acquaintance
but
they
were
always
courteously
repelled
finally
he
came
to
be
spoken
of
as
the
hermit
and
it
was
with
astonishment
almost
incredulity
that
in
the
spring
of
his
third
year
in
the
adirondacks
he
was
found
at
paul
smith
offering
his
services
as
guide
to
a
party
of
gentlemen
who
their
guide
having
fallen
suddenly
ill
were
in
sore
straits
for
some
one
to
take
them
down
again
through
the
lakes
whether
it
was
that
he
had
grown
suddenly
weary
of
his
isolation
and
solitude
or
whether
need
had
driven
him
to
this
means
of
earning
money
no
one
knew
and
he
did
not
say
but
once
having
entered
on
the
life
of
a
guide
he
threw
himself
into
it
as
heartily
as
if
it
had
been
his
avocation
and
speedily
became
one
of
the
best
guides
in
the
region
it
was
observed
however
that
whenever
he
could
do
so
he
avoided
taking
parties
in
which
there
were
ladies
sometimes
for
a
whole
season
it
would
happen
that
he
had
not
once
been
seen
in
charge
of
such
a
party
sometimes
when
it
was
difficult
in
fact
impossible
for
him
to
assign
any
reason
for
refusing
to
go
with
parties
containing
members
of
the
obnoxious
sex
he
would
at
the
last
moment
privately
entreat
some
other
guide
to
take
his
place
and
voluntarily
relinquishing
all
the
profits
of
the
engagement
disappear
and
be
lost
for
several
days
during
these
absences
it
was
often
said
steve
gone
to
see
his
wife
or
off
with
that
indian
wife
o
his
up
north
and
these
vague
idle
gossiping
conjectures
slowly
crystallized
into
a
positive
rumor
which
no
one
could
either
trace
or
gainsay
and
so
the
years
went
on
one
two
three
four
and
dandy
steve
had
become
one
of
the
most
popular
and
guides
in
the
adirondack
country
his
seeming
effeminacy
of
attire
had
been
long
proved
to
mark
no
effeminacy
of
nature
no
lack
of
strength
there
was
not
a
better
shot
a
stronger
rower
on
the
list
of
summer
guides
nor
a
better
cook
and
provider
every
party
which
went
out
under
his
care
returned
with
warm
praise
for
steve
with
a
friendly
feeling
also
which
would
in
many
instances
have
warmed
into
familiar
acquaintance
if
steve
would
have
permitted
it
but
with
all
his
cheerfulness
and
obliging
he
never
lost
a
certain
quantity
of
reserve
even
the
men
whose
servant
he
was
for
the
time
being
were
insensibly
constrained
to
respect
this
and
to
keep
the
distance
he
not
they
determined
there
remained
always
something
they
could
not
as
the
phrase
was
make
out
about
him
his
aversion
to
women
was
well
known
so
much
so
that
it
had
come
to
be
a
tacitly
understood
thing
that
parties
of
which
women
were
members
need
not
waste
their
time
trying
to
induce
dandy
steve
to
take
them
in
charge
but
fate
had
not
lost
sight
of
steve
yet
he
had
had
his
period
of
solitary
independence
of
apparent
absolute
control
of
his
own
destinies
his
seven
years
were
up
if
he
had
supposed
that
he
was
serving
them
like
jacob
of
old
for
that
mistress
freedom
he
was
mistaken
the
seven
years
were
up
how
little
he
dreamed
what
the
eighth
would
bring
him
it
was
midsummer
and
one
of
steve
best
patrons
richard
cravath
of
philadelphia
had
not
yet
appeared
for
three
summers
cravath
and
two
or
three
of
his
friends
had
spent
a
month
in
the
adirondacks
hunting
fishing
camping
under
steve
guidance
they
were
all
rich
men
and
generous
and
what
was
to
steve
of
far
more
worth
than
the
liberal
pay
considerate
of
his
feelings
tolerant
of
his
reticence
not
a
man
of
them
but
respected
their
queer
silent
guide
individuality
as
much
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
their
own
sphere
of
life
steve
had
learned
by
some
unpleasant
experience
that
this
delicate
consideration
did
not
always
obtain
between
employers
and
employed
it
takes
an
organization
finer
than
the
ordinary
to
perceive
and
live
up
to
the
perception
that
the
fact
that
you
have
hired
a
man
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
per
month
to
cook
your
food
or
drive
your
horses
gives
you
no
right
to
ask
him
in
regard
to
his
private
personal
affairs
prying
questions
which
you
would
not
dare
to
put
to
common
acquaintances
in
society
as
week
after
week
went
by
and
no
news
came
from
cravath
steve
found
himself
really
saddened
at
the
thought
of
not
seeing
him
he
had
not
realized
how
large
a
part
of
his
summer
pleasure
as
well
as
profit
came
from
the
month
sport
with
this
philadelphia
party
wistfully
he
scrutinized
the
lists
of
arrivals
at
the
different
houses
day
after
day
for
the
familiar
names
but
they
were
not
to
be
found
at
last
after
he
had
given
over
looking
for
them
he
was
electrified
one
evening
in
september
by
having
his
name
called
from
the
piazza
of
one
of
the
hotels
steve
is
that
you
you
just
the
man
i
want
i
was
afraid
we
were
too
late
to
get
you
it
was
cravath
and
with
him
the
two
friends
whom
steve
had
liked
best
of
all
who
had
been
in
cravath
parties
it
was
the
joy
of
the
sudden
surprise
which
prevented
steve
giving
his
customary
close
attention
to
cravath
somewhat
vague
description
of
the
party
he
had
brought
this
time
you
must
arrange
for
eight
steve
he
said
there
may
not
be
quite
so
many
one
or
two
of
the
fellows
i
hoped
for
have
not
arrived
and
it
is
too
late
to
wait
long
for
any
one
if
they
are
not
here
by
day
after
we
will
and
oh
steve
he
continued
with
an
affected
careless
ease
but
all
the
while
eying
steve
face
anxiously
i
forgot
to
mention
that
i
have
brought
my
wife
along
this
time
she
positively
refused
to
let
me
off
she
said
she
was
tired
of
hearing
so
much
about
the
adirondacks
she
was
coming
this
time
to
see
for
herself
you
need
have
the
least
fear
about
having
her
along
she
as
good
a
traveller
as
i
am
every
bit
i
had
her
in
training
at
it
for
thirty
years
and
i
tell
her
old
as
we
are
we
are
better
campers
than
most
of
the
young
people
that
so
cravath
replied
steve
his
countenance
clouded
and
his
voice
less
joyous
i
answer
for
it
with
you
but
do
you
think
sir
any
lady
could
go
where
we
went
last
year
in
his
heart
steve
was
saying
to
himself
the
idea
of
bringing
an
old
woman
out
here
i
would
do
it
for
anybody
in
the
world
but
mr
cravath
my
wife
can
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
that
i
can
steve
said
cravath
you
need
not
begin
to
look
blue
steve
and
if
you
back
out
or
serve
us
any
of
your
tricks
such
as
i
heard
of
never
speak
to
you
again
never
i
would
serve
you
any
trick
cravath
you
know
that
replied
steve
proudly
and
i
have
the
least
idea
of
backing
out
but
i
am
afraid
cravath
will
be
disappointed
he
added
as
he
went
down
the
steps
and
luckily
did
not
turn
his
head
to
see
cravath
face
covered
with
the
laughter
he
had
been
restraining
during
the
last
few
moments
caught
him
by
jove
he
said
turning
to
his
companion
a
tall
man
caught
him
by
jove
randall
he
never
once
thought
to
ask
of
what
sex
the
other
members
of
the
party
might
be
he
took
it
for
granted
my
wife
was
to
be
the
only
woman
do
you
think
that
was
quite
fair
cravath
replied
randall
he
would
never
have
taken
us
in
the
world
if
he
had
known
there
were
three
women
in
the
party
pshaw
laughed
cravath
good
enough
for
him
for
having
such
a
crotchet
in
his
head
we
take
it
out
of
him
this
trip
or
set
it
stronger
than
ever
said
randall
my
mind
misgives
me
we
shall
wish
we
had
not
done
it
he
may
turn
sulky
and
unmanageable
on
our
hands
when
he
finds
himself
trapped
i
risk
it
said
cravath
confidently
if
i
ca
bring
him
around
helen
wingate
will
i
never
saw
the
man
woman
child
or
dumb
beast
yet
that
could
resist
her
randall
sighed
poor
child
he
said
is
her
gayety
something
wonderful
one
would
not
think
to
look
at
her
that
she
had
ever
had
an
hour
sorrow
but
my
wife
tells
me
that
she
can
not
speak
of
that
husband
of
hers
yet
without
the
most
passionate
weeping
i
know
it
it
a
shame
replied
cravath
to
see
a
glorious
woman
like
that
throwing
her
life
away
on
a
memory
i
did
have
a
hope
at
one
time
that
she
would
marry
again
but
i
given
it
up
if
she
would
have
married
any
one
it
would
have
been
george
walton
last
winter
no
one
has
ever
come
so
near
her
as
he
did
but
she
sent
him
off
at
last
like
all
the
rest
the
two
fellows
on
whom
cravath
was
counting
to
make
up
his
party
of
eight
did
not
appear
and
on
the
second
morning
after
the
above
conversations
steve
received
orders
to
have
his
boats
in
readiness
at
ten
to
start
with
the
cravath
party
only
six
in
number
old
ben
was
on
the
wharf
as
steve
was
making
his
final
arrangements
wall
steve
he
said
shifting
his
quid
of
tobacco
in
a
leisurely
manner
from
one
side
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
you
got
a
soft
thing
again
you
a
damned
lucky
fellow
steve
dunno
whether
you
know
it
or
not
no
i
do
know
it
replied
steve
curtly
and
what
more
i
believe
in
luck
do
yer
said
ben
reflectively
wall
i
do
an
lord
knows
ai
because
i
seen
so
much
of
it
say
steve
he
added
how

come
to
take
on
such
a
lot
o
women

trip
lot
o
women

what
d
ye

shouted
steve
there
no
womenkind
going
except
one
cravath
wife
and
i
wish
to
thunder
he
left
her
behind
oh
is
that
all
said
ben
half
innocently
half
mischievously
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
his
ground
be
the
rest
on
goin
to
stay
here
there
three
women
in
the
party
randall
he
got
his
wife
and
there
a
widder
along
too
mighty
she
is
nothin
old
about
her
i
can
tell
yer
a
flash
shot
from
steve
eyes
a
ejaculation
came
from
his
lips
as
he
turned
fiercely
towards
ben
there
they
be
now
all
down
the
steps
continued
ben
chuckling
i
reckon
ye
got
took
in
for
onst
but
it
too
late
now
yes
thought
steve
angrily
as
he
looked
at
the
smiling
party
coming
towards
the
landing
three
men
and
three
women
it
too
late
now
if
it
had
been
a
sooner
have
been
early
enough
but
it
the
last
time
i
caught
in
any
such
way
what
a
blamed
fool
i
was
not
to
ask
who
they
were
never
thought
of
the
cravath
set
lumbering
themselves
up
with
women
and
a
very
unpromising
sternness
settled
down
on
steve
expressive
features
as
he
stooped
down
to
readjust
some
of
the
smaller
packages
in
the
boat
meantime
the
members
of
the
approaching
party
were
not
wholly
at
ease
in
their
minds
cravath
had
confessed
his
suppression
of
the
truth
and
randall
evident
misgiving
as
to
the
success
of
the
experiment
had
proved
contagious
if
he
as
queer
as
you
say
murmured
cravath
he
can
make
it
awfully
disagreeable
for
us
i
am
almost
afraid
to
go
nonsense
cried
helen
wingate
merrily
i
take
that
out
of
him
before
night
who
ever
heard
of
a
man
really
disliking
women
it
is
only
some
particular
woman
he
disliked
he
wo
dislike
us
he
dislike
me
i
going
to
take
him
by
storm
let
me
run
ahead
and
jump
in
first
and
she
danced
on
in
advance
of
the
rest
wait
mrs
wingate
cried
cravath
hurrying
after
her
let
me
come
with
you
but
he
was
too
late
she
ran
on
and
as
she
reached
the
shore
sprang
lightly
on
the
plank
calling
out
oh
there
are
all
our
things
in
already
guide
guide
please
give
me
your
hand
quick
i
want
to
be
the
first
one
in
the
boat
steve
rose
slowly
turned
at
the
first
glimpse
of
his
face
helen
wingate
uttered
a
shriek
which
rang
in
the
air
and
fell
backwards
on
the
sand
insensible
good
god
she
lost
her
footing
exclaimed
cravath
she
is
killed
cried
the
others
as
they
hurried
breathlessly
to
the
spot
but
when
they
reached
it
there
knelt
dandy
steve
on
the
ground
by
her
side
his
face
whiter
than
hers
his
eyes
streaming
with
tears
his
arms
around
her
calling
helen
helen
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
voices
he
looked
up
and
instantly
seeking
cravath
face
gasped
she
is
my
wife
mr
cravath
the
dumbness
of
unutterable
astonishment
fell
on
the
whole
party
at
these
words
but
in
another
second
rallying
from
the
shock
they
knelt
around
the
seemingly
lifeless
woman
trying
to
arouse
her
presently
she
opened
her
eyes
and
seeing
randall
face
bending
above
her
said
faintly
it
stephen
i
always
knew
i
should
find
him
somewhere
then
she
sank
away
again
into
unconsciousness
the
party
for
the
lakes
must
be
postponed
that
was
evident
neither
would
it
go
out
under
the
guidance
of
dandy
steve
nor
would
wingate
go
with
it
those
two
things
were
equally
evident
which
facts
revolving
slowly
in
old
ben
brain
led
him
to
seat
himself
on
the
shore
and
abide
the
course
of
events
when
about
noon
cravath
appeared
coming
to
look
after
their
hastily
abandoned
effects
old
ben
touched
his
hat
civilly
and
said
sir
i
thought
maybe
i
get
this
job
o
guidin
now
leastways
i
stay
by
yer
truck
here
till
somebody
come
to
look
it
up
old
ben
was
the
guide
of
all
others
cravath
would
have
chosen
next
to
dandy
steve
by
jove
ben
he
said
this
is
luck
can
you
go
off
with
us
at
once
steve
has
got
other
business
on
hand
that
lady
is
his
wife
from
whom
he
has
been
separated
many
years
so
i
heerd
him
say
sir
when
he
was
her
up
answered
ben
composedly
as
if
such
things
were
a
daily
occurrence
in
the
adirondacks
can
you
go
with
us
at
once
continued
cravath
in
an
hour
sir
said
ben
and
in
an
hour
they
were
off
a
bewildered
but
on
the
whole
a
relieved
and
happier
party
than
they
had
been
in
the
morning
helen
long
sorrow
in
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
her
husband
had
ennobled
and
purified
her
character
and
greatly
endeared
her
to
her
friends
but
that
which
had
seemed
to
them
to
be
explainable
only
by
the
fact
of
his
death
or
his
unworthiness
she
knew
was
explainable
by
her
own
folly
and
pride
the
end
of
the
story
is
best
told
in
old
ben
words
he
was
never
tired
of
telling
it
i
never
heered
exactly
the
hull
partikelers
he
said
for
they
gone
long
before
we
got
back
and
the
folks
she
was
with
the
kind
that
talks
much
but
i
could
see
they
set
a
store
by
her

or

o
foolin
the
prince
little
sweetheart
she
was
very
young
no
man
had
ever
made
love
to
her
before
she
belonged
to
the
people
the
common
people
her
parents
were
poor
and
could
not
buy
any
wedding
trousseau
for
her
but
that
did
not
make
any
difference
a
carriage
was
sent
from
the
court
for
her
and
she
was
carried
away
just
as
she
was
in
her
stuff
gown
the
gown
the
prince
first
saw
her
in
he
liked
her
best
in
that
he
said
and
moreover
what
odds
did
it
make
about
clothes
were
there
not
rooms
upon
rooms
in
the
palace
full
of
the
most
superb
clothes
for
princes
sweethearts
it
was
into
one
of
these
rooms
that
she
was
taken
first
on
all
sides
of
it
were
high
glass
cases
reaching
up
to
the
ceiling
and
filled
with
gowns
and
mantles
and
laces
and
jewels
everything
a
woman
could
wear
was
there
and
all
of
the
very
finest
what
satins
what
velvets
what
feathers
and
flowers
even
down
to
shoes
and
stockings
every
shade
and
color
of
stockings
of
the
daintiest
silk
the
little
sweetheart
gazed
breathless
at
them
all
but
she
did
not
have
time
to
wonder
for
in
a
moment
more
she
was
met
by
attendants
some
young
some
old
all
dressed
gayly
she
did
not
dream
at
first
that
they
were
servants
till
they
began
all
together
asking
her
what
she
would
like
to
put
on
would
she
have
a
lace
gown
or
a
satin
would
she
like
feathers
or
flowers
and
one
ran
this
way
and
one
that
and
among
them
all
the
little
sweetheart
was
so
flustered
she
did
not
know
if
she
were
really
alive
and
on
the
earth
or
had
been
transported
to
some
fairy
land
and
before
she
fairly
realized
what
was
being
done
they
had
her
clad
in
the
most
beautiful
gown
that
was
ever
seen
white
satin
with
gold
butterflies
on
it
and
a
white
lace
mantle
embroidered
in
gold
butterflies
all
white
and
gold
she
was
from
top
to
toe
all
but
one
foot
and
there
was
something
very
odd
about
that
she
heard
one
of
the
women
whispering
to
the
other
behind
her
back
it
is
too
bad
there
is
any
mate
to
this
slipper
well
she
will
have
to
wear
this
pink
one
it
is
too
big
but
if
we
pin
it
up
at
the
heel
she
can
keep
it
on
the
prince
really
must
get
some
more
slippers
and
then
they
put
on
her
left
foot
a
pink
satin
slipper
which
was
so
much
too
big
it
had
to
be
pinned
up
in
plaits
at
each
side
and
the
pearl
buckle
on
the
top
hid
her
foot
quite
out
of
sight
but
the
little
sweetheart
did
not
care
in
fact
she
had
no
time
to
think
for
the
queen
came
sailing
in
and
spoke
to
her
and
crowds
of
ladies
in
dresses
so
bright
and
beautiful
that
they
dazzled
her
eyes
and
the
prince
was
there
kissing
her
and
in
a
minute
they
were
married
and
went
floating
off
in
a
dance
which
was
so
swift
it
did
not
feel
so
much
like
dancing
as
it
did
like
being
carried
through
the
air
by
a
gentle
wind
through
room
after
room
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
rooms
and
each
one
more
beautiful
than
the
last
from
garden
to
garden
some
full
of
trees
some
with
beautiful
lakes
in
them
some
full
of
solid
beds
of
flowers
they
went
sometimes
dancing
sometimes
walking
sometimes
it
seemed
to
the
little
sweetheart
floating
every
hour
there
was
some
new
beautiful
thing
to
see
some
new
beautiful
thing
to
do
and
the
prince
never
left
her
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
and
when
he
came
back
he
brought
her
gifts
and
kissed
her
gifts
upon
gifts
he
kept
bringing
till
the
little
sweetheart
hands
were
so
full
she
had
to
lay
the
things
down
on
tables
or
wherever
she
could
find
place
for
them
which
was
not
easy
for
all
the
rooms
were
so
full
of
beautiful
things
that
it
was
difficult
to
move
about
without
knocking
something
down
the
hours
flew
by
like
minutes
the
sun
came
up
high
in
the
heavens
but
nobody
seemed
tired
nobody
stopped
dance
dance
whirl
whirl
song
and
laughter
and
ceaseless
motion
that
was
all
that
was
to
be
seen
or
heard
in
this
wonderful
court
to
which
the
little
sweetheart
had
been
brought
noon
came
but
nothing
stopped
nobody
left
off
dancing
and
the
musicians
played
faster
than
ever
and
so
it
was
all
the
long
afternoon
and
through
the
twilight
and
as
soon
as
it
was
really
dark
all
the
rooms
and
the
gardens
and
the
lakes
blazed
out
with
millions
of
lamps
till
it
was
lighter
far
than
day
and
the
ladies
dresses
as
they
danced
back
and
forth
shone
and
sparkled
like
butterflies
wings
at
last
the
lamps
began
one
by
one
to
go
out
and
by
degrees
a
soft
sort
of
light
like
moonlight
settled
down
on
the
whole
place
and
the
servants
that
had
robed
the
little
sweetheart
in
her
white
satin
gown
took
it
off
and
put
her
to
bed
in
a
gold
bedstead
with
golden
silk
sheets
oh
thought
the
little
sweetheart
i
shall
never
go
to
sleep
in
the
world
and
i
sure
i
do
want
to
i
shall
just
keep
my
eyes
open
all
night
and
see
what
happens
next
all
the
beautiful
clothes
she
had
taken
off
were
laid
on
a
sofa
near
the
bed
the
white
satin
dress
at
top
and
the
big
pink
satin
slipper
with
its
huge
pearl
buckle
on
the
floor
in
plain
sight
where
is
the
other
thought
the
little
sweetheart
i
do
believe
i
lost
it
off
that
the
way
they
come
to
have
so
many
odd
ones
but
how
queer
i
lost
off
the
tight
one
but
the
big
one
was
pinned
to
my
foot
she
said
speaking
out
loud
before
she
thought
that
was
what
kept
it
on
you
are
talking
in
your
sleep
my
love
said
the
prince
who
was
close
by
her
side
kissing
her
indeed
i
am
not
asleep
at
all
i
have
shut
my
eyes
said
the
little
sweetheart
and
the
next
thing
she
knew
it
was
broad
daylight
the
sun
streaming
into
her
room
and
the
air
resounding
in
all
directions
with
music
and
laughter
and
flying
steps
of
dancers
just
as
it
had
been
yesterday
the
little
sweetheart
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
around
her
she
thought
it
very
strange
that
she
was
all
alone
the
prince
gone
no
one
there
to
attend
to
her
in
a
few
moments
more
she
noticed
that
all
her
clothes
were
gone
too
oh
she
thought
i
suppose
one
never
wears
the
same
clothes
twice
in
this
court
and
they
will
bring
me
others
i
hope
there
will
be
two
slippers
alike
presently
she
began
to
grow
impatient
but
being
a
timid
little
creature
and
having
never
before
seen
the
inside
of
a
court
or
been
a
prince
sweetheart
she
did
not
venture
to
stir
or
to
make
any
sound
only
sat
still
in
her
bed
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
at
last
she
could
not
bear
the
sounds
of
the
dancing
and
laughing
and
playing
and
singing
any
longer
so
she
jumped
up
and
rolling
one
of
the
golden
silk
sheets
around
her
looked
out
of
the
window
there
they
all
were
the
crowds
of
gay
people
just
as
they
had
been
the
day
before
when
she
was
among
them
whirling
dancing
laughing
singing
the
tears
came
into
the
little
sweetheart
eyes
as
she
gazed
what
could
it
mean
that
she
was
deserted
in
this
way
not
even
her
clothes
left
for
her
she
was
as
much
a
prisoner
in
her
room
as
if
the
door
had
been
locked
as
hour
after
hour
passed
a
new
misery
began
to
oppress
her
she
was
hungry
seriously
distressingly
hungry
she
had
been
too
happy
to
eat
the
day
before
though
she
had
sipped
and
tasted
many
delicious
beverages
and
viands
which
the
prince
had
pressed
upon
her
she
had
not
taken
any
substantial
food
and
now
she
began
to
feel
faint
for
the
want
of
it
as
noon
drew
near
the
time
at
which
she
was
accustomed
in
her
father
house
to
eat
dinner
the
pangs
of
her
hunger
grew
unbearable
i
ca
bear
it
another
minute
she
said
to
herself
i
must
and
i
will
have
something
to
eat
i
will
slip
down
by
some
back
way
to
the
kitchen
there
must
be
a
kitchen
i
suppose
so
saying
she
opened
one
of
the
doors
and
timidly
peered
into
the
next
room
it
chanced
to
be
the
room
with
the
great
glass
cases
full
of
fine
gowns
and
laces
where
she
had
been
dressed
by
the
obsequious
attendants
on
the
previous
day
no
one
was
in
the
room
glancing
fearfully
in
all
directions
she
rolled
the
golden
silk
sheet
tightly
around
her
and
flew
rather
than
ran
across
the
floor
and
took
hold
of
the
handle
of
one
of
the
glass
doors
alas
it
was
locked
she
tried
another
another
all
were
locked
in
despair
she
turned
to
fly
back
to
her
bedroom
when
suddenly
she
spied
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
close
by
the
case
where
hung
her
beautiful
white
satin
dress
a
little
heap
of
what
looked
like
brown
rags
she
darted
toward
it
snatched
it
from
the
floor
and
in
a
second
more
was
safe
back
in
her
room
it
was
her
own
old
stuff
gown
what
luck
said
the
little
sweetheart
nobody
will
ever
know
me
in
this
i
put
it
on
and
creep
down
the
back
stairs
and
beg
a
mouthful
of
food
from
some
of
the
servants
and
they
never
know
who
i
am
and
then
i
go
back
to
bed
and
stay
there
till
the
prince
comes
to
fetch
me
of
course
he
will
come
before
long
and
if
he
comes
and
finds
me
gone
i
hope
he
will
be
frightened
half
to
death
and
think
i
have
been
carried
off
by
robbers
poor
foolish
little
sweetheart
it
did
not
take
her
many
seconds
to
slip
into
the
ragged
old
stuff
gown
then
she
crept
out
keeping
close
to
the
walls
so
that
she
could
hide
behind
the
furniture
if
any
one
saw
her
she
listened
cautiously
at
each
door
before
she
opened
it
and
turned
away
from
some
where
she
heard
sounds
of
merry
talking
and
laughing
in
the
third
room
that
she
entered
she
saw
a
sight
that
arrested
her
instantly
and
made
her
cry
out
in
astonishment
a
girl
who
looked
so
much
like
her
that
she
might
have
been
her
own
sister
and
what
was
stranger
wore
a
brown
stuff
gown
exactly
like
her
own
was
busily
at
work
in
this
room
with
a
big
broom
killing
spiders
as
the
little
sweetheart
appeared
in
the
doorway
this
girl
looked
up
and
said
oh
ho
there
you
are
are
you
i
thought
you
be
out
before
long
and
then
she
laughed
unpleasantly
who
are
you
said
the
little
sweetheart
beginning
to
tremble
all
over
oh
i
a
prince
sweetheart
said
the
girl
laughing
still
more
unpleasantly
and
leaning
on
her
broom
she
stared
at
the
little
sweetheart
from
top
to
toe
but
began
the
little
sweetheart
oh
we
all
princes
sweethearts
interrupted
several
voices
coming
all
at
once
from
different
corners
of
the
big
room
and
before
the
little
sweetheart
could
get
out
another
word
she
found
herself
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
or
more
girls
and
women
all
carrying
brooms
and
all
laughing
unpleasantly
as
they
looked
at
her
what
she
gasped
as
she
gazed
at
their
stuff
gowns
and
their
brooms
you
were
all
of
you
princes
sweethearts
is
it
only
for
one
day
then
only
for
one
day
they
all
replied
and
always
after
that
do
you
have
to
kill
spiders
she
cried
yes
that
or
nothing
they
said
you
see
it
is
a
great
deal
of
work
to
keep
all
the
rooms
in
this
court
clean
is
it
very
dull
work
to
kill
spiders
said
the
little
sweetheart
yes
very
they
said
all
speaking
at
once
but
it
better
than
sitting
still
doing
nothing
do
the
princes
ever
speak
to
you
sobbed
the
little
sweetheart
yes
sometimes
they
answered
just
then
the
little
sweetheart
own
prince
came
hurrying
by
all
in
armor
from
head
to
foot
splendid
shining
armor
that
clinked
as
he
walked
oh
there
he
is
cried
the
little
sweetheart
springing
forward
then
suddenly
she
recollected
her
stuff
gown
and
shrunk
back
into
the
group
but
the
prince
had
seen
her
oh
how
d
do
he
said
kindly
i
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
i
off
for
the
grand
review
do
tire
yourself
out
over
the
spiders
and
he
was
gone
i
hate
him
cried
the
little
sweetheart
her
eyes
flashing
and
her
cheeks
scarlet
oh
no
you
do
exclaimed
all
the
that
the
worst
of
it
you
may
think
you
do
but
you
do
you
love
him
all
the
time
after
you
once
begun
i

said
the
little
sweetheart

the
others

court

and
dance
from

till

and
new
people

and

all
the
time

the
little
sweetheart

and

sweethearts

they
said
the
little
sweetheart
and
burst
into
tears
heavens
cried
i
what
a
dream
as
i
opened
my
eyes
there
stood
the
little
sweetheart
in
my
room
vanishing
away
so
vivid
had
been
the
dream

most
extraordinary
dream

of
the
princes
