i
mother
carey
herself
by
and
by
there
came
along
a
flock
of
petrels
who
are
mother
own
chickens
they
flitted
along
like
a
flock
of
swallows
hopping
and
skipping
from
wave
to
wave
lifting
their
little
feet
behind
them
so
daintily
that
tom
fell
in
love
with
them
at
once
nancy
stopped
reading
and
laid
down
the
copy
of
water
babies
on
the
table
no
more
just
now
she
said
i
hear
mother
coming
it
was
a
cold
dreary
day
in
late
october
with
an
east
wind
and
a
chill
of
early
winter
in
the
air
the
cab
stood
in
front
of
captain
house
with
a
trunk
beside
the
driver
and
a
general
air
of
expectancy
on
the
part
of
neighbors
at
the
opposite
windows
carey
came
down
the
front
stairway
followed
by
gilbert
and
kathleen
gilbert
with
his
mother
small
bag
and
travelling
cloak
kathleen
with
her
umbrella
while
little
peter
flew
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
a
small
box
of
sandwiches
pressed
to
his
bosom
carey
did
not
wear
her
usual
look
of
sweet
serenity
but
nothing
could
wholly
mar
the
gracious
dignity
of
her
face
and
presence
as
she
came
down
the
stairs
with
her
quick
firm
tread
her
flock
following
her
she
looked
the
ideal
mother
her
fine
height
her
splendid
carriage
her
deep
chest
her
bright
eye
and
fresh
color
all
bespoke
the
happy
contented
active
woman
though
something
in
the
way
of
transient
anxiety
lurked
in
the
eyes
and
lips
the
carriage
is
too
early
she
said
let
us
come
into
the
sitting
room
for
five
minutes
i
have
said
my
and
kissed
you
all
a
dozen
times
but
i
shall
never
be
done
until
i
am
out
of
your
sight
o
mother
mother
how
can
we
let
you
go
wailed
kathleen
kitty
how
can
you
exclaimed
nancy
what
does
it
matter
about
us
when
mother
has
the
long
journey
and
father
is
so
ill
it
will
not
be
for
very
long
it
ca
be
said
carey
wistfully
the
telegram
only
said
of
typhoid
but
these
low
fevers
sometimes
last
a
good
while
and
are
very
weakening
so
i
may
not
be
able
to
bring
father
back
for
two
or
three
weeks
i
ought
to
be
in
fortress
monroe
day
after
you
must
take
turns
in
writing
to
me
children
every
single
day
mother
every
single
thing
that
happens
a
fat
letter
every
morning
they
promised
in
chorus
if
there
is
any
real
trouble
remember
to
telegraph
your
uncle
allan
did
you
write
down
his
address
broad
street
new
york
bother
him
about
little
things
for
he
is
not
well
you
know
gilbert
displayed
a
filled
with
memoranda
and
addresses
and
in
any
small
difficulty
send
for
cousin
ann
carey
went
on
the
mere
thought
of
her
coming
will
make
me
toe
the
mark
i
can
tell
you
that
was
gilbert
rejoinder
better
than
any
ogre
or
cousin
ann
is
even
for
peter
said
nancy
and
will
my
be
good
and
make
nancy
no
trouble
said
his
mother
lifting
him
to
her
lap
for
one
last
hug
i
be
an
angel
boy
pretty
near
all
the
time
he
asserted
between
mouthfuls
of
apple
or
most
pretty
near
he
added
prudently
as
if
unwilling
to
promise
anything
superhuman
in
the
way
of
behavior
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
required
only
a
tolerable
show
of
virtue
for
peter
to
win
encomiums
at
any
time
he
would
brush
his
curly
mop
of
hair
away
from
his
forehead
lift
his
eyes
part
his
lips
showing
a
row
of
tiny
white
teeth
then
a
dimple
would
appear
in
each
cheek
and
a
seraphic
expression
wholly
at
variance
with
the
facts
would
overspread
the
baby
face
whereupon
the
beholder
mother
carey
his
sisters
the
cook
or
the
chambermaid
everybody
indeed
but
cousin
ann
who
could
never
be
wheedled
would
cry
angel
boy
and
kiss
him
he
was
even
kissed
now
though
he
had
done
nothing
at
all
but
exist
and
be
an
enchanting
personage
which
is
one
of
the
injustices
of
a
world
where
a
large
number
of
virtuous
and
people
go
unkissed
to
their
graves
i
know
joanna
and
ellen
will
take
good
care
of
the
housekeeping
continued
carey
and
you
will
be
in
school
from
nine
to
two
so
that
the
time
wo
go
heavily
for
the
rest
i
make
nancy
responsible
if
she
is
young
you
must
remember
that
you
are
all
younger
still
and
i
trust
you
to
her
the
last
time
you
did
it
it
did
work
very
well
and
gilbert
gave
nancy
a
sly
wink
to
recall
a
little
matter
of
family
history
when
there
had
been
a
delinquency
on
somebody
part
nancy
face
crimsoned
and
her
lips
parted
for
a
quick
retort
and
none
too
pleasant
a
one
apparently
her
mother
intervened
quietly
we
never
speak
of
times
gilly
or
where
would
any
of
us
be
we
always
think
of
times
i
shall
trust
nancy
next
time
and
next
time
and
next
time
and
keep
on
trusting
till
i
can
trust
her
forever
nancy
face
lighted
up
with
a
passion
of
love
and
loyalty
she
responded
to
the
touch
of
her
mother
faith
as
a
harp
to
the
favoring
wind
but
she
said
nothing
she
only
glowed
and
breathed
hard
and
put
her
trembling
hand
about
her
mother
neck
and
under
her
chin
now
it
time
one
more
kiss
all
around
remember
you
are
mother
carey
own
chickens
there
may
be
gales
while
i
am
away
but
you
must
ride
over
the
crests
of
the
billows
as
merry
as
so
many
flying
fish
oh
my
littlest
how
can
mother
leave
you
i
opened
the
lunch
box
to
see
what
ellen
gave
you
but
i
only
broke
off
two
teenty
weenty
corners
of
sandwiches
and
one
little
bite
out
of
a
cookie
said
peter
creating
a
diversion
according
to
his
wont
ellen
and
joanna
came
to
the
front
door
and
the
children
flocked
down
the
frozen
pathway
to
the
gate
after
their
mother
getting
a
touch
of
her
wherever
and
whenever
they
could
and
jumping
up
and
down
between
whiles
to
keep
warm
gilbert
closed
the
door
of
the
carriage
and
it
turned
to
go
down
the
street
one
window
was
open
and
there
was
a
last
glimpse
of
the
beloved
face
framed
in
the
dark
blue
velvet
bonnet
one
last
wave
of
a
hand
in
a
brown
muff
oh
she
is
so
beautiful
sobbed
kathleen
her
bonnet
is
just
the
color
of
her
eyes
and
she
was
crying
there
never
was
anybody
like
mother
said
nancy
leaning
on
the
gate
shivering
with
cold
and
emotion
there
never
was
and
there
never
will
be
we
can
try
and
try
kathleen
and
we
try
all
of
us
but
mother
would
have
to
try
mother
must
have
been
partly
born
so
ii
the
chickens
it
was
captain
carey
favorite
admiral
who
was
responsible
for
the
phrase
by
which
mother
and
children
had
been
known
for
some
years
the
captain
then
a
lieutenant
had
brought
his
friend
home
one
saturday
afternoon
a
little
earlier
than
had
been
expected
and
they
went
to
find
the
family
in
the
garden
laughter
and
the
sound
of
voices
led
them
to
the
and
as
they
parted
the
syringa
bushes
they
looked
through
them
and
surprised
the
charming
group
a
throng
of
children
like
to
flowers
were
sown
about
the
grass
beside
or
climbed
her
knee
i
looked
who
were
that
favored
company
that
is
the
way
a
poet
would
have
described
what
the
admiral
saw
and
if
you
want
to
see
anything
truly
and
beautifully
you
must
generally
go
to
a
poet
carey
held
peter
then
a
crowing
baby
in
her
lap
gilbert
was
tickling
peter
chin
with
a
buttercup
nancy
was
putting
a
wreath
of
leaves
on
her
mother
hair
and
kathleen
was
swinging
from
an
bough
her
yellow
curls
flying
might
i
inquire
what
you
think
of
that
asked
the
father
well
the
admiral
said
mothers
and
children
make
a
pretty
good
picture
at
any
time
but
i
should
say
this
one
could
be
two
for
the
navy
eh
all
four
for
the
navy
perhaps
laughed
the
young
man
nancy
has
already
chosen
a
and
kathleen
a
commodore
they
are
modest
little
girls
they
do
you
credit
peter
i
hope
i
given
them
something
i
tried
hard
enough
but
they
are
mostly
the
work
of
the
lady
in
the
chair
come
on
and
say
how
d
do
before
many
saturdays
the
admiral
lap
had
superseded
all
other
places
as
a
gathering
ground
for
the
little
careys
whom
he
called
the
stormy
petrels
mother
carey
he
explained
to
them
came
from
the
latin
this
being
not
only
his
personal
conviction
but
one
that
had
the
backing
of
brewer
dictionary
of
phrase
and
fable
the
french
call
them
oiseaux
de
notre
that
means
birds
of
our
lady
kitty
and
they
are
the
sailors
friends
mother
carey
sends
them
to
warn
seafarers
of
approaching
storms
and
bids
them
go
out
all
over
the
seas
to
show
the
good
birds
the
way
home
you
have
your
hands
full
if
you
going
to
be
mother
carey
chickens
i
love
to
show
good
birds
the
way
home
said
gilbert
can
a
naughty
bird
show
a
good
bird
the
way
home
addy
this
bland
question
came
from
nancy
who
had
a
decided
talent
for
sarcasm
considering
her
years
of
course
the
admiral
might
have
stopped
the
children
from
calling
him
addy
but
they
seemed
to
do
it
because
admiral
was
difficult
and
anyway
they
loved
him
so
much
they
simply
had
to
take
some
liberties
with
him
besides
although
he
was
the
greatest
disciplinarian
that
ever
walked
a
deck
he
was
so
soft
and
flexible
on
land
that
he
was
perfectly
ridiculous
and
delightful
the
day
when
the
children
were
christened
mother
carey
chickens
was
nancy
tenth
birthday
a
time
when
the
family
was
striving
to
give
her
her
proper
name
having
begun
wrong
with
her
at
the
outset
she
was
the
first
you
see
and
the
first
is
something
of
an
event
take
it
how
you
will
it
is
obvious
that
at
the
beginning
they
could
not
address
a
tiny
thing
on
a
pillow
as
nancy
because
she
was
too
young
she
was
not
even
alluded
to
at
that
early
date
as
she
but
always
as
it
so
they
called
her
baby
and
let
it
go
at
that
then
there
was
a
long
period
when
she
was
still
too
young
to
be
called
nancy
and
though
so
far
as
age
was
concerned
she
might
properly
have
held
on
to
her
name
of
baby
she
could
with
propriety
because
there
was
gilbert
then
and
he
was
baby
moreover
she
gradually
became
so
indescribably
quaint
and
bewitching
and
comical
and
saucy
that
every
one
sought
diminutives
for
her
nicknames
fond
names
little
names
and
all
sorts
of
words
that
tried
to
describe
her
charm
and
could
so
there
was
poppet
and
smiles
and
minx
and
rogue
and
midget
and
ladybird
and
finally
nan
and
nannie
by
degrees
to
soberer
nancy
nancy
is
ten
mused
the
admiral
bless
my
soul
how
time
flies
you
were
a
young
ensign
carey
and
i
well
remember
the
letter
you
wrote
me
when
this
little
lass
came
into
harbor
just
wait
a
minute
i
believe
the
scrap
of
newspaper
verse
you
enclosed
has
been
in
my
wallet
ever
since
i
always
liked
it
i
recall
writing
to
you
said
carey
as
you
had
lent
me
five
hundred
dollars
to
be
married
on
i
thought
i
ought
to
keep
you
posted
oh
father
did
you
have
to
borrow
money
cried
kathleen
i
did
my
dear
there
no
disgrace
in
borrowing
if
you
pay
back
and
i
did
your
uncle
allan
was
starting
in
business
and
i
had
just
put
my
little
capital
in
with
his
when
i
met
your
mother
if
you
had
met
your
mother
would
you
have
wanted
to
marry
her
yes
cried
nancy
eagerly
fifty
of
her
at
which
everybody
laughed
and
what
became
of
the
money
you
put
in
uncle
allan
business
asked
gilbert
with
unexpected
intelligence
there
was
a
moment
embarrassment
and
an
exchange
of
glances
between
mother
and
father
before
he
replied
oh
that
coming
back
multiplied
six
times
over
one
of
these
days
allan
has
a
very
promising
project
on
hand
just
now
admiral
glad
to
hear
it
a
delightful
fellow
and
straight
as
a
die
i
only
wish
he
could
perform
once
in
a
while
instead
of
promising
he
will
if
only
he
keeps
his
health
but
he
heavily
handicapped
there
poor
chap
well
what
the
verse
the
admiral
put
on
his
glasses
prettily
assisted
by
kathleen
who
was
on
his
knee
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
give
him
a
french
kiss
when
the
spectacles
were
safely
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
whereupon
he
read
there
came
to
port
last
sunday
night
the
queerest
little
craft
without
an
inch
of
rigging
on
i
looked
and
looked
and
laughed
it
seemed
so
curious
that
she
should
cross
the
unknown
water
and
moor
herself
within
my
room
my
daughter
o
my
daughter
yet
by
these
presents
witness
all
she
welcome
fifty
times
and
comes
consigned
to
hope
and
love
and
common
metre
rhymes
she
has
no
manifest
but
this
no
flag
floats
the
water
she
rather
new
for
british
lloyd
my
daughter
o
my
daughter
ring
out
wild
bells
and
tame
ones
too
ring
out
the
lover
moon
ring
in
the
little
worsted
socks
ring
in
the
bib
and
spoon

george
w
cable
oh
peter
how
pretty
said
mother
carey
all
in
a
glow
you
never
showed
it
to
me
you
were
too
much
occupied
with
the
aforesaid
little
craft
was
she
nan
i
mean
nancy
and
her
father
pinched
her
ear
and
pulled
a
curly
lock
nancy
was
a
lovely
creature
to
the
eye
and
she
came
by
her
good
looks
naturally
enough
for
three
generations
her
father
family
had
been
known
as
the
handsome
careys
and
when
lieutenant
carey
chose
margaret
gilbert
for
his
wife
he
was
lucky
enough
to
win
the
loveliest
girl
in
her
circle
thus
it
was
still
the
handsome
careys
in
the
time
of
our
story
for
all
the
children
were
and
the
general
public
could
never
decide
whether
nancy
or
kathleen
was
the
belle
of
the
family
kathleen
had
fair
curls
skin
like
a
rose
and
delicate
features
not
a
blemish
to
mar
her
exquisite
prettiness
all
colors
became
her
all
hats
suited
her
hair
she
was
the
carey
beauty
so
long
as
nancy
remained
out
of
sight
but
the
moment
that
young
person
appeared
kathleen
left
something
to
be
desired
nancy
piqued
nancy
sparkled
nancy
glowed
nancy
occasionally
pouted
and
not
infrequently
blazed
nancy
eyes
had
to
be
continually
searched
for
news
both
of
herself
and
of
the
immediate
world
about
her
if
you
did
not
keep
looking
at
her
every
once
in
so
often
you
could
keep
up
with
the
progress
of
events
she
might
flash
a
dozen
telegrams
to
somebody
about
something
while
your
head
was
turned
away
kathleen
could
be
safely
left
unwatched
for
an
hour
or
so
without
fear
of
change
her
moods
were
less
variable
her
temper
evener
her
interest
in
the
passing
moment
less
keen
her
absorption
in
the
particular
subject
less
intense
walt
whitman
might
have
been
thinking
of
nancy
when
he
wrote
there
was
a
child
went
forth
every
day
and
the
first
object
he
looked
upon
that
object
he
became
and
that
object
became
part
of
him
for
the
day
or
a
certain
part
of
the
day
or
for
many
years
or
stretching
cycles
of
years
kathleen
nature
needed
to
be
stirred
nancy
to
be
controlled
the
impulse
coming
from
within
the
only
way
that
counts
in
the
end
though
the
guiding
force
may
be
applied
from
without
nancy
was
more
impulsive
than
industrious
more
generous
than
wise
more
plucky
than
prudent
she
had
none
too
much
perseverance
and
no
patience
at
all
gilbert
was
a
fiery
youth
of
twelve
all
for
adventure
he
kindled
quickly
but
did
not
burn
long
so
deeds
of
daring
would
be
in
his
line
instantaneous
ones
quickly
settled
leaving
the
victor
with
a
swelling
chest
and
a
feather
in
cap
rather
an
obvious
feather
suited
gilbert
best
peter
oh
peter
aged
four
can
be
dismissed
in
very
few
words
as
a
consummate
charmer
and
the
usual
elements
that
go
to
the
making
of
a
small
boy
were
all
there
but
mixed
with
white
magic
it
is
painful
to
think
of
the
dozens
of
girl
babies
in
long
clothes
who
must
have
been
feeling
premonitory
pangs
when
peter
was
four
to
think
they
could
all
marry
him
when
they
grew
up
iii
the
common
denominator
three
weeks
had
gone
by
since
mother
carey
departure
for
fortress
monroe
and
the
children
had
mounted
from
one
moral
triumph
to
another
john
bunyan
looking
in
at
the
windows
might
have
exclaimed
who
would
true
valor
see
let
him
come
hither
it
is
easy
to
go
wrong
in
a
wicked
world
but
there
are
certain
circumstances
under
which
one
is
pledged
to
virtue
when
like
a
knight
of
the
olden
time
you
wear
your
motto
next
your
heart
and
fight
for
it
death
rather
than
defeat
we
are
able
because
we
think
we
are
able
follow
honor
and
the
like
these
sentiments
look
beautifully
as
class
mottoes
on
summer
graduation
programmes
but
some
of
them
apparently
disappear
from
circulation
before
cold
weather
sets
in
it
is
difficult
to
do
right
we
repeat
but
not
when
mother
is
away
from
us
for
the
first
time
since
we
were
born
not
when
she
who
is
the
very
sun
of
home
is
shining
elsewhere
and
we
are
groping
in
the
dim
light
without
her
only
remembering
her
last
words
and
our
last
promises
not
difficult
when
we
think
of
the
eyes
the
color
of
the
blue
velvet
bonnet
and
the
tears
falling
from
them
they
are
hundreds
of
miles
away
but
we
see
them
looking
at
us
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
the
last
thing
at
night
not
difficult
when
we
think
of
father
gay
gallant
father
desperately
ill
and
mother
nursing
him
father
with
the
kind
smile
and
the
jolly
little
sparkles
of
fun
in
his
eyes
father
tall
and
splendid
as
the
gods
in
full
uniform
father
so
brave
that
if
a
naval
battle
ever
did
come
his
way
he
would
demolish
the
foe
in
an
instant
father
with
a
warm
strong
hand
clasping
ours
on
high
days
and
holidays
taking
us
on
great
expeditions
where
we
see
life
at
its
best
and
taste
incredible
joys
the
most
quarrelsome
family
if
the
house
burns
down
over
their
heads
will
stop
disputing
until
the
emergency
is
over
and
they
get
under
a
new
roof
somehow
in
times
of
great
trial
calamity
sorrow
the
differences
that
separate
people
are
forgotten
is
it
rather
like
the
process
in
mathematics
where
we
reduce
fractions
to
a
common
denominator
it
was
no
time
for
anything
but
superior
behavior
in
the
carey
household
that
was
distinctly
felt
from
kitchen
to
nursery
ellen
the
cook
was
tidier
joanna
the
second
maid
more
amiable
nancy
who
was
responsible
rose
earlier
than
the
rest
and
went
to
bed
later
after
locking
doors
and
windows
that
had
been
left
unlocked
since
the
flood
i
am
responsible
she
said
three
or
four
times
each
day
to
herself
and
it
is
to
be
feared
to
others
her
heavenly
patience
in
dressing
peter
every
few
hours
without
comment
struck
the
most
callous
observer
as
admirable
peter
never
remembered
that
he
had
any
clothes
on
he
might
have
been
a
real
stormy
petrel
breasting
the
billows
in
his
birthday
suit
and
expecting
his
feathers
to
be
dried
when
and
how
the
lord
pleased
he
comported
himself
in
the
presence
of
dust
mud
water
liquid
refreshment
and
sticky
substances
exactly
as
if
clean
white
sailor
suits
grew
on
every
bush
and
could
be
renewed
at
pleasure
even
gilbert
was
moved
to
spontaneous
admiration
and
respect
at
the
sight
of
nancy
zeal
nobody
would
know
you
nancy
it
is
simply
wonderful
and
i
only
wish
it
could
last
he
said
even
this
style
of
encomium
was
received
sweetly
though
there
had
been
moments
in
her
previous
history
when
nancy
would
have
retorted
in
a
very
pointed
manner
when
she
was
responsible
not
even
had
he
gone
the
length
of
calling
nancy
an
unspeakable
pig
would
she
have
said
anything
she
had
a
blissful
consciousness
that
had
she
been
examined
indications
of
angelic
wings
and
not
bristles
would
have
been
discovered
under
her
blouse
gilbert
by
the
way
never
suspected
that
the
masters
in
his
own
school
wondered
whether
he
had
experienced
religion
or
was
working
on
some
sort
of
boyish
wager
he
took
his
two
weekly
reports
home
cautiously
for
fear
that
they
might
break
on
the
way
pasted
them
on
large
pieces
of
paper
and
framed
them
in
elaborate
red
white
and
blue
stars
united
by
strips
of
gold
paper
how
captain
and
carey
laughed
and
cried
over
this
characteristic
message
when
it
reached
them
oh
they
darlings
mother
carey
cried
of
course
they
are
the
captain
murmured
feebly
why
should
they
be
considering
you
it
is
really
just
as
easy
to
do
right
as
wrong
kathleen
said
nancy
when
the
girls
were
going
to
bed
one
night
assented
kathleen
with
some
reservations
in
her
tone
for
she
was
more
judicial
and
logical
than
her
sister
but
you
have
to
keep
your
mind
on
it
so
and
never
relax
a
single
bit
then
it
lots
easier
for
a
few
weeks
than
it
is
for
long
stretches
that
true
agreed
nancy
it
would
be
hard
to
keep
it
up
forever
and
you
have
to
love
somebody
or
something
like
fury
every
minute
or
you
ca
do
it
at
all
how
do
the
people
manage
that
ca
love
like
that
or
have
anybody
to
love
i
do
know
said
kathleen
sleepily
i
so
worn
out
with
being
good
that
every
night
i
just
say
my
prayers
and
tumble
into
bed
exhausted
last
night
i
fell
asleep
praying
i
honestly
did
tell
that
to
the
marines
remarked
nancy
incredulously
iv
the
broken
circle
the
three
weeks
were
running
into
a
month
now
and
virtue
still
reigned
in
the
carey
household
but
things
were
different
everybody
but
peter
saw
the
difference
peter
dwelt
from
morn
till
eve
in
that
land
of
pure
delight
which
is
ignorance
of
death
the
children
no
longer
bounded
to
meet
the
postman
but
waited
till
joanna
brought
in
the
mail
steadily
daily
the
letters
changed
in
tone
first
they
tried
to
be
cheerful
later
on
they
spoke
of
trusting
that
the
worst
was
past
then
of
hoping
that
father
was
holding
his
own
oh
if
he
was
holding
his
own
sobbed
nancy
if
we
were
only
there
with
him
helping
mother
ellen
said
to
joanna
one
morning
in
the
kitchen
it
my
belief
the
captain
not
going
to
get
well
and
i
like
to
go
to
newburyport
to
see
my
cousin
and
not
be
in
the
house
when
the
children
told
and
joanna
said
shame
on
you
not
to
stand
by
in
their
hour
of
trouble
at
which
ellen
quailed
and
confessed
herself
a
coward
finally
came
a
day
never
to
be
forgotten
a
day
that
swept
all
the
former
days
clean
out
of
memory
as
a
great
wave
engulfs
all
the
little
ones
in
its
path
a
day
when
uncle
allan
being
too
ill
to
travel
cousin
ann
of
all
people
in
the
universe
cousin
ann
came
to
bring
the
terrible
news
that
captain
carey
was
dead
never
think
that
cousin
ann
did
not
suffer
and
sympathize
and
do
her
rocky
best
to
comfort
she
did
indeed
but
she
was
thankful
that
her
task
was
of
brief
duration
carey
knew
how
it
would
be
and
had
planned
all
so
that
she
herself
could
arrive
not
long
after
the
blow
had
fallen
peter
by
his
mother
orders
she
had
thought
of
everything
was
at
a
neighbor
house
the
centre
of
all
interest
the
focus
of
all
gayety
he
was
too
young
to
see
the
tears
of
his
elders
with
any
profit
baby
plants
grow
best
in
sunshine
the
others
were
huddled
together
in
a
sad
group
at
the
front
window
eyes
swollen
handkerchiefs
rolled
into
drenched
pathetic
little
wads
cousin
ann
came
in
from
the
dining
room
with
a
tumbler
and
spoon
in
her
hand
see
here
children
she
said
bracingly
you
been
crying
for
the
last
twelve
hours
without
stopping
and
i
do
blame
you
a
mite
if
i
was
the
crying
kind
i
do
the
same
thing
now
do
you
think
you
got
grit
enough
all
three
of
you
to
bear
up
for
your
mother
sake
when
she
first
comes
in
i
mixed
you
each
a
good
dose
of
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
and
it
splendid
for
the
nerves
your
mother
must
get
a
night
sleep
somehow
and
when
she
gets
back
a
little
of
her
strength
you
be
the
greatest
comfort
she
has
in
the
world
the
way
carrying
on
now
you
be
the
death
of
her
it
was
a
good
idea
and
the
dose
had
courage
in
it
gilbert
took
the
first
sip
kathleen
the
second
and
nancy
the
third
and
hardly
had
the
last
swallow
disappeared
down
the
poor
aching
throats
before
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
gate
some
one
got
out
and
handed
out
carey
whose
step
used
to
be
lighter
than
nancy
a
strange
gentleman
oh
not
a
stranger
it
was
the
dear
admiral
helping
mother
up
the
path
they
had
been
unconsciously
expecting
the
brown
muff
and
blue
velvet
bonnet
but
these
had
vanished
like
father
and
all
the
beautiful
things
of
the
past
years
and
in
their
place
was
black
raiment
that
chilled
their
hearts
but
the
black
figure
had
flung
back
the
veil
that
hid
her
from
the
longing
eyes
of
the
children
and
when
she
raised
her
face
it
was
full
of
the
old
love
she
was
and
she
was
pale
but
she
was
mother
and
the
three
young
things
tore
open
the
door
and
clasped
her
in
their
arms
sobbing
choking
whispering
all
sorts
of
tender
comfort
their
childish
tears
falling
like
healing
dew
on
her
poor
heart
the
admiral
soothed
and
quieted
them
each
in
turn
all
but
nancy
cousin
ann
medicine
was
of
no
avail
and
strangling
with
sobs
nancy
fled
to
the
attic
until
she
was
strong
enough
to
say
for
mother
sake
without
a
quiver
in
her
voice
then
she
crept
down
and
as
she
passed
her
mother
room
on
tiptoe
she
looked
in
and
saw
that
the
chair
by
the
window
the
chair
that
had
been
vacant
for
a
month
was
filled
and
that
the
figure
was
what
was
left
to
them
a
strange
sad
quiet
mother
who
had
lost
part
of
herself
somewhere
the
gay
part
the
cheerful
part
the
part
that
made
her
so
piquantly
and
entrancingly
different
from
other
women
nancy
stole
in
softly
and
put
her
young
smooth
cheek
against
her
mother
quietly
stroking
her
hair
there
are
four
of
us
to
love
you
and
take
care
of
you
she
said
it
is
quite
so
bad
as
if
there
was
nobody
carey
clasped
her
close
oh
my
nancy
my
first
my
oldest
god
will
help
me
i
know
that
but
just
now
i
need
somebody
close
and
warm
and
soft
somebody
with
arms
to
hold
and
breath
to
speak
and
lips
to
kiss
i
ought
not
to
sadden
you
nor
lean
on
you
you
are
too
young
but
i
must
a
little
just
at
the
first
you
see
dear
you
come
next
to
father
next
to
father
nancy
life
was
set
to
a
new
tune
from
that
moment
here
was
her
spur
her
creed
the
incentive
the
inspiration
she
had
lacked
she
did
not
suddenly
grow
older
than
her
years
but
simply
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
came
to
a
realization
of
herself
her
opportunity
her
privilege
her
duty
the
face
of
life
had
changed
and
nancy
changed
with
it
do
you
love
me
next
to
mother
the
admiral
had
asked
coaxingly
once
when
nancy
was
eight
and
on
his
lap
as
usual
oh
dear
no
said
nancy
thoughtfully
shaking
her
head
why
that
rather
a
blow
to
me
the
admiral
exclaimed
pinching
an
ear
and
pulling
a
curl
i
flattered
myself
that
when
i
was
on
my
best
behavior
i
came
next
to
mother
it
this
way
addy
dear
said
nancy
cuddling
up
to
his
waistcoat
and
giving
a
sigh
of
delight
that
there
were
so
many
nice
people
in
the
world
it
just
this
way
first
there
mother
and
then
all
round
mother
there
a
wide
wide
space
and
then
father
and
you
come
next
the
space
the
admiral
smiled
a
grave
lovely
smile
that
often
crept
into
his
eyes
when
he
held
mother
carey
chickens
on
his
knee
he
kissed
nancy
on
the
little
white
spot
behind
the
ear
where
the
brown
hair
curled
in
tiny
rings
like
grape
tendrils
soft
as
silk
and
delicate
as
pencil
strokes
he
said
nothing
but
his
boyish
dreams
were
in
the
kiss
and
certain
hopes
of
manhood
that
had
never
been
realized
he
was
thinking
that
margaret
gilbert
was
a
fortunate
and
happy
woman
to
have
become
mother
carey
such
a
mother
too
that
all
about
her
was
a
wide
wide
space
and
next
the
space
the
rest
of
the
world
nearer
or
farther
according
to
their
merits
he
wondered
if
motherhood
ought
not
to
be
like
that
and
he
thought
if
it
were
it
would
be
a
great
help
to
god
v
how
about
julia
we
often
speak
of
a
family
circle
but
there
are
none
too
many
of
them
parallel
lines
never
meeting
squares
triangles
oblongs
and
particularly
those
oblongs
pulled
askew
known
as
rhomboids
these
and
other
geometrical
figures
abound
but
circles
are
comparatively
few
in
a
true
family
circle
a
father
and
a
mother
first
clasp
each
hands
liking
well
to
be
thus
clasped
then
they
stretch
out
a
hand
on
either
side
and
these
are
speedily
grasped
by
children
who
hold
one
another
firmly
and
complete
the
ring
one
child
is
better
than
nothing
a
great
deal
better
than
nothing
it
is
at
least
an
effort
in
the
right
direction
but
the
circle
that
ensues
is
not
even
then
a
truly
nice
shape
you
can
stand
as
handsomely
as
ever
you
like
but
it
simply
come
round
the
minute
that
two
three
four
five
join
in
the
roundness
grows
and
the
merriment
too
and
the
laughter
and
the
power
to
do
things
responsibility
and
care
also
but
what
is
the
use
of
discouraging
circles
when
there
are
not
enough
of
them
anyway
the
carey
family
circle
had
been
round
and
complete
with
love
and
harmony
between
all
its
component
parts
in
family
rhomboids
for
instance
mother
loves
the
children
and
father
does
not
or
father
does
but
does
not
love
mother
or
father
and
mother
love
each
other
and
the
children
do
not
get
their
share
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
all
the
little
geometrical
peculiarities
which
keep
a
rhomboid
from
being
a
circle
but
one
person
can
just
stand
out
enough
to
spoil
the
shape
or
put
hands
behind
back
and
refuse
to
join
at
all
about
the
ugliest
thing
in
the
universe
is
that
habit
you
would
think
that
anybody
however
dull
might
consider
his
hands
and
guess
by
the
look
of
them
that
they
must
be
made
to
work
and
help
and
take
hold
of
somebody
else
hands
miserable
useless
flabby
paws
those
of
the
that
he
feeds
and
dresses
himself
with
and
then
hangs
to
his
selfish
sides
or
puts
behind
his
beastly
back
when
captain
carey
went
on
his
long
journey
into
the
unknown
and
uncharted
land
the
rest
of
the
careys
tried
in
vain
for
a
few
months
to
be
still
a
family
and
did
not
succeed
at
all
they
clung
as
closely
to
one
another
as
ever
they
could
but
there
was
always
a
gap
in
the
circle
where
father
had
been
some
men
silent
unresponsive
and
especially
absorbed
in
business
might
drop
out
and
not
be
missed
but
captain
carey
was
full
of
vitality
warmth
and
high
spirits
it
is
strange
so
many
men
think
that
the
possession
of
a
child
makes
them
a
father
it
does
not
but
it
is
a
curious
and
very
general
misapprehension
captain
carey
was
a
boy
with
his
boys
and
a
gallant
lover
with
his
girls
to
his
wife
oh
we
will
not
even
touch
upon
that
ground
she
never
did
to
any
one
or
anything
but
her
own
heart
such
an
one
could
never
disappear
from
memory
such
a
loss
could
never
be
made
wholly
good
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
remember
father
pride
and
justify
it
to
recall
his
care
for
mother
and
take
his
place
so
far
as
might
be
the
only
thing
for
all
as
the
months
went
on
was
to
be
what
mother
called
the
three
b
brave
bright
and
busy
to
be
the
last
was
by
far
the
easiest
for
the
earliest
effort
at
economy
had
been
the
reluctant
dismissal
of
joanna
the
chambermaid
in
novels
the
devoted
servant
always
insisted
on
remaining
without
wages
but
this
story
concerns
itself
with
life
at
a
later
date
joanna
wept
at
the
thought
of
leaving
but
she
never
thought
of
the
romantic
and
illogical
expedient
of
staying
on
without
compensation
captain
carey
salary
had
been
five
thousand
dollars
or
rather
was
to
have
been
for
he
had
only
attained
his
promotion
three
months
before
his
death
there
would
have
been
an
extra
five
hundred
dollars
a
year
when
he
was
at
sea
and
on
the
strength
of
this
addition
to
their
former
income
he
intended
to
increase
the
amount
of
his
life
insurance
but
it
had
not
yet
been
done
when
the
sudden
illness
seized
him
an
illness
that
began
so
gently
and
innocently
and
terminated
with
such
sudden
and
unexpected
fatality
the
life
insurance
such
as
it
was
must
be
put
into
the
bank
for
emergencies
carey
realized
that
that
was
the
only
proper
thing
to
do
when
there
were
four
children
under
fifteen
to
be
considered
the
pressing
question
however
was
how
to
keep
it
in
the
bank
and
subsist
on
a
captain
pension
of
thirty
dollars
a
month
there
was
the
ten
thousand
hers
and
the
captain
in
allan
carey
business
but
allan
was
seriously
ill
with
nervous
prostration
and
no
money
put
into
his
business
ever
had
come
out
even
in
a
modified
form
the
admiral
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
and
even
had
he
been
near
at
hand
carey
would
never
have
confided
the
family
difficulties
to
him
she
could
hardly
have
allowed
him
even
to
tide
her
over
her
immediate
pressing
anxieties
remembering
his
invalid
sister
and
his
many
responsibilities
no
the
years
until
gilbert
was
able
to
help
or
nancy
old
enough
to
use
her
talents
or
the
years
before
the
money
invested
with
allan
would
bring
dividends
those
must
be
years
of
on
part
and
more
even
than
that
they
must
be
fruitful
years
in
which
not
mere
saving
and
economizing
but
earning
would
be
necessary
it
was
only
lately
that
carey
had
talked
over
matters
with
the
three
eldest
children
but
the
present
house
was
too
expensive
to
be
longer
possible
as
a
home
and
the
question
of
moving
was
a
matter
of
general
concern
joanna
had
been
up
to
the
present
moment
the
only
economy
but
alas
joanna
was
but
a
drop
in
the
necessary
bucket
on
a
certain
morning
in
march
carey
sat
in
her
room
with
a
letter
in
her
lap
the
children
surrounding
her
it
was
from
manson
allan
carey
younger
partner
the
sort
of
letter
that
dazed
her
opening
up
as
it
did
so
many
questions
of
expediency
duty
and
responsibility
the
gist
of
it
was
this
that
allan
carey
was
a
broken
man
in
mind
and
body
that
both
for
the
climate
and
for
treatment
he
was
to
be
sent
to
a
rest
cure
in
the
adirondacks
that
sometime
or
other
in
opinion
the
firm
investments
might
be
profitable
if
kept
long
enough
and
there
was
no
difficulty
in
keeping
them
for
nobody
in
the
universe
wanted
them
at
the
present
moment
that
allan
little
daughter
julia
had
no
source
of
income
whatever
after
her
father
monthly
bills
were
paid
and
that
her
only
relative
outside
of
the
careys
a
certain
miss
ann
chadwick
had
refused
to
admit
her
into
her
house
carey
only
asked
miss
chadwick
as
a
last
resort
wrote
manson
for
his
very
soul
quailed
at
the
thought
of
letting
you
his
brother
widow
suffer
any
more
by
his
losses
than
was
necessary
and
he
studiously
refused
to
let
you
know
the
nature
and
extent
of
his
need
miss
chadwick
only
response
to
his
request
was
that
she
believed
in
every
tub
standing
on
its
own
bottom
and
if
he
had
harbored
the
same
convictions
he
would
not
have
been
in
his
present
extremity
i
am
telling
you
this
my
dear
carey
the
writer
went
on
just
to
get
your
advice
about
the
child
i
well
know
that
your
income
will
not
support
your
own
children
what
therefore
shall
we
do
with
julia
i
am
a
poor
young
bachelor
with
two
sisters
to
support
i
shall
find
a
position
of
course
and
i
shall
never
cease
nursing
carey
various
affairs
and
projects
during
the
time
of
his
exile
but
i
can
not
assume
an
ounce
more
of
financial
responsibility
there
had
been
quite
a
council
over
the
letter
and
parts
of
it
had
been
read
more
than
once
by
carey
but
the
children
though
very
sympathetic
with
uncle
allan
and
loud
in
their
exclamations
of
poor
julia
had
not
suggested
any
remedy
for
the
situation
well
said
carey
folding
the
letter
there
seems
to
be
but
one
thing
for
us
to
do
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
have
julia
come
and
live
with
us
be
one
of
the
family
exclaimed
gilbert
that
is
what
i
want
to
discuss
she
replied
you
three
are
the
family
as
well
as
come
in
she
called
for
she
heard
the
swift
feet
of
the
youngest
petrel
ascending
the
stairs
come
in
where
is
there
a
sweeter
peter
a
fleeter
peter
a
neater
peter
than
ours
i
should
like
to
know
and
where
a
better
adviser
for
the
council
mother
how
you
inquired
kathleen
i
meant
neater
when
he
is
just
washed
and
dressed
retorted
mother
are
you
coming
to
the
family
council
sweet
pete
peter
climbed
on
his
mother
knee
and
answered
by
a
vague
affirmative
nod
his
whole
mind
being
on
the
extraction
of
a
slippery
marble
from
a
bottle
then
be
quiet
and
speak
only
when
we
ask
your
advice
continued
carey
unless
i
were
obliged
to
children
i
should
be
sorry
to
go
against
all
your
wishes
i
might
be
willing
to
bear
my
share
of
a
burden
but
more
is
needed
than
that
i
think
said
nancy
suddenly
aware
now
of
the
trend
of
her
secret
convictions
i
think
julia
is
a
smug
conceited
vain
affected
little
pea
here
she
caught
her
mother
eye
and
suddenly
she
heard
inside
of
her
head
or
heart
or
conscience
a
chime
of
words
to
making
a
magnificent
oratorical
leap
she
finished
her
sentence
with
only
a
second
break
peacock
but
if
mother
thinks
julia
is
a
duty
a
duty
she
is
and
we
must
brace
up
and
do
her
must
we
love
her
mother
or
can
we
just
be
good
and
polite
to
her
giving
her
the
breast
and
taking
the
drumstick
wo
ever
say
let
me
rob
like
cousin
ann
when
takes
the
breast
kathleen
looked
distinctly
unresigned
she
hated
drumsticks
and
all
that
they
stood
for
in
life
she
disliked
the
wall
side
of
the
bed
the
middle
seat
in
the
carriage
the
heel
of
the
loaf
the
underdone
biscuit
the
tail
part
of
the
fish
the
scorched
end
of
the
omelet
it
will
make
more
difference
to
me
than
anybody
she
said
gloomily
everything
makes
more
difference
to
you
kitty
remarked
gilbert
i
mean
i
always
fourth
when
the
cake
plate
passed
in
everything
now
julia
be
fourth
and
i
shall
be
fifth
it
lucky
people
tumble
off
the
floor
poor
abused
kathleen
cried
gilbert
well
mother
you
always
right
but
i
ca
see
why
you
take
another
one
into
the
family
when
we
been
saying
for
a
week
there
is
even
enough
for
us
five
to
live
on
it
looks
mighty
queer
to
put
me
in
the
public
school
and
spend
the
money
you
save
that
way
on
julia
way
down
deep
in
her
heart
mother
carey
felt
a
pang
there
was
a
little
seed
of
hard
in
gilbert
that
she
wanted
him
to
dig
up
from
the
soil
and
get
rid
of
before
it
sprouted
and
waxed
too
strong
julia
is
a
carey
chicken
after
all
gilbert
she
said
but
she
uncle
allan
chicken
and
i
captain
carey
eldest
son
that
the
very
note
i
should
strike
if
i
were
you
his
mother
responded
only
with
a
little
different
accent
what
would
captain
carey
eldest
son
like
to
do
for
his
only
cousin
a
little
girl
younger
than
himself
a
girl
who
had
a
very
silly
unwise
unhappy
mother
for
the
first
five
years
of
her
life
and
who
is
now
practically
fatherless
for
a
time
at
least
gilbert
wriggled
as
if
in
great
moral
discomfort
as
indeed
he
was
well
he
said
i
do
want
to
be
selfish
and
if
the
girls
say
yes
i
have
to
fall
in
but
it
is
logic
all
the
same
to
ask
a
sixth
to
share
what
is
enough
for
five
i
agree
with
you
there
gilly
smiled
his
mother
the
only
question
before
the
council
is
does
logic
belong
at
the
top
in
the
scale
of
reasons
why
we
do
certain
things
if
we
ask
julia
to
come
she
will
have
to
into
line
as
you
say
and
share
the
family
misfortunes
as
best
she
can
she
a
regular
shirk
and
always
was
this
from
kathleen
she
would
never
come
at
all
if
she
guessed
her
cousins
opinion
of
her
that
is
very
certain
remarked
carey
pointedly
now
mother
look
me
in
the
eye
and
speak
the
whole
truth
asked
nancy
you
like
julia
carey
laughed
as
she
answered
frankly
then
i
do
not
but
she
continued
i
do
not
like
several
of
the
remarks
that
have
been
made
at
this
council
yet
i
manage
to
bear
them
of
course
i
sha
call
julia
smug
and
conceited
to
her
face
asserted
nancy
encouragingly
i
hope
that
her
bosom
friend
gladys
ferguson
has
disappeared
from
view
the
last
time
julia
visited
us
kitty
and
i
got
so
tired
of
gladys
ferguson
dresses
her
french
maid
her
bedroom
furniture
and
her
travels
abroad
that
we
wrote
her
name
on
a
piece
of
paper
put
it
in
a
box
and
buried
it
in
the
back
yard
the
minute
julia
left
the
house
when
you
write
mother
tell
julia
there
a
piece
of
breast
for
her
but
not
a
mouthful
of
my
drumstick
goes
to
gladys
ferguson
the
more
the
hungrier
better
invite
gladys
too
suggested
gilbert
then
we
can
say
like
that
simple
little
kid
in
wordsworth
and
brother
little
maid
how
many
may
you
be
many
seven
in
all
she
said
and
wondering
looked
at
me
then
it
goes
on
thus
laughed
nancy
who
are
they
i
pray
you
tell
she
answered
are
we
mother
with
us
makes
five
and
then
there
gladys
and
julee
everybody
joined
in
the
laugh
then
including
peter
who
was
especially
uproarious
and
who
had
an
idea
he
had
made
the
joke
himself
else
why
did
they
all
kiss
him
how
about
julia
what
do
you
say
peter
asked
his
mother
i
want
her
she
played
horse
once
said
peter
the
opinion
that
the
earth
revolved
around
his
one
small
person
was
natural
at
the
age
of
four
but
the
same
idea
of
the
universe
still
existed
in
gilbert
mind
a
boy
of
thirteen
ought
perhaps
to
have
a
clearer
idea
of
the
relative
sizes
of
world
and
individual
at
least
that
was
the
conviction
in
mother
carey
mind
vi
nancy
idea
nancy
had
a
great
many
ideas
first
and
last
they
were
generally
unique
and
interesting
at
least
though
it
is
to
be
feared
that
few
of
them
were
practical
however
it
was
nancy
idea
to
build
peter
a
playhouse
in
the
plot
of
ground
at
the
back
of
the
charlestown
house
and
it
was
she
who
was
the
architect
and
head
carpenter
that
plan
had
brought
much
happiness
to
peter
and
much
comfort
to
the
family
it
was
nancy
idea
that
she
gilbert
and
kathleen
should
all
be
so
equally
polite
to
cousin
ann
chadwick
that
there
should
be
no
favorite
to
receive
an
undue
share
of
invitations
to
the
chadwick
house
nancy
had
made
two
visits
in
succession
both
offered
in
the
nature
of
tributes
to
her
charms
and
virtues
and
she
did
not
wish
a
third
if
you
two
ca
be
attractive
then
i
be
all
was
her
edict
and
turn
about
has
got
to
be
the
rule
in
this
matter
i
not
going
to
wear
the
martyr
crown
alone
it
will
adorn
your
young
brows
every
now
and
then
or
i
know
the
reason
why
it
was
nancy
idea
to
let
joanna
go
and
divide
her
work
among
the
various
members
of
the
family
it
was
also
nancy
idea
that
there
being
no
strictly
masculine
bit
of
martyrdom
to
give
to
gilbert
he
should
polish
the
silver
for
his
share
this
was
an
idea
that
proved
so
unpopular
with
gilbert
that
it
was
speedily
relinquished
gilbert
was
wonderful
with
tools
so
wonderful
that
mother
carey
feared
he
would
be
a
carpenter
instead
of
the
commander
of
a
great
war
ship
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
odd
jobs
to
offer
him
there
came
a
day
when
even
peter
realized
that
life
was
real
and
life
was
earnest
when
the
floor
was
strewn
with
playthings
his
habit
had
been
to
stand
amid
the
wreckage
and
smile
whereupon
joanna
would
fly
and
restore
everything
to
its
accustomed
place
after
the
passing
of
joanna
mother
carey
sat
placidly
in
her
chair
in
the
nursery
and
peter
stood
ankle
deep
among
his
toys
smiling
now
put
everything
where
it
belongs
sweet
pete
said
mother
you
do
it
smiled
peter
i
am
very
busy
darning
your
stockings
peter
i
do
like
to
pick
up
muddy
no
it
is
much
fun
but
it
has
to
be
done
peter
went
over
to
the
window
and
gazed
at
the
landscape
i
dess
go
play
with
ellen
he
remarked
in
honeyed
tones
that
would
be
nice
after
you
clear
away
your
toys
and
blocks
i
dess
i
play
with
ellen
first
suggested
peter
starting
slowly
towards
the
door
no
we
always
work
first
and
play
afterwards
said
mother
going
on
darning
peter
felt
caught
in
a
net
of
irresistible
and
pitiless
logic
come
and
help
me
muddy
he
coaxed
and
as
she
looked
up
he
suddenly
let
fly
all
his
armory
of
weapons
at
once
two
dimples
tossing
back
of
curls
parted
lips
tiny
white
teeth
sweet
voice
mother
carey
impulse
was
to
cast
herself
on
the
floor
and
request
him
simply
to
smile
on
her
and
she
would
do
his
lightest
bidding
but
controlling
her
secret
desires
she
answered
i
would
help
if
you
needed
me
but
you
do
you
a
great
big
boy
now
i
not
a
great
big
boy
cried
peter
i
only
a
great
big
little
boy
do
waste
time
sweet
pete
go
to
work
want
roared
peter
with
the
voice
of
an
infant
bull
so
we
all
do
it
because
she
had
to
go
that
i
darning
stockings
the
net
tightened
round
peter
defenceless
body
and
he
hurled
himself
against
his
rocking
horse
and
dragged
it
brutally
to
a
corner
having
disposed
of
most
of
his
strength
and
temper
in
this
operation
he
put
away
the
rest
of
his
goods
and
chattels
more
quietly
but
with
streaming
eyes
and
heaving
bosom
splendid
commented
mother
carey
joanna
could
have
done
it
better
and
it
wo
be
half
so
much
work
next
time
peter
heard
the
words
next
time
distinctly
and
knew
the
grim
face
of
duty
at
last
though
he
was
less
than
five
the
second
and
far
more
tragic
time
was
when
he
was
requested
to
make
himself
ready
for
luncheon
kathleen
to
stand
near
and
help
a
little
if
really
necessary
now
peter
was
absolutely
clean
french
phrases
are
detestable
where
there
is
any
english
equivalent
but
in
this
case
there
is
none
so
i
will
explain
to
the
youngest
reader
who
may
speak
only
one
language
that
the
base
of
peter
was
always
clean
he
received
one
full
bath
and
several
partial
ones
in
every
hours
but
on
this
base
were
evidences
of
his
eternal
activities
and
indeed
of
other
people
they
were
divided
into
three
classes
those
contracted
in
the
society
of
joanna
when
she
took
him
such
as
sand
water
mud
grass
stains
paint
lime
putty
or
varnish
those
derived
from
visits
to
his
sisters
at
their
occupations
such
as
ink
paints
lead
pencils
paste
glue
and
mucilage
those
amassed
in
his
stays
with
ellen
in
the
kitchen
sugar
molasses
spice
pudding
sauce
black
currants
raisins
dough
berry
stains
assorted
according
to
season
chocolate
jelly
jam
and
preserves
these
deposits
were
not
deep
but
were
simply
dabs
on
the
facade
of
peter
and
through
them
the
eyes
and
soul
of
him
shone
delicious
and
radiant
they
could
be
rubbed
off
with
a
moist
handkerchief
if
water
were
handy
and
otherwise
if
it
were
not
and
the
person
who
rubbed
always
wanted
for
some
mysterious
reason
to
kiss
him
immediately
afterwards
for
peter
had
the
largest
kissing
acquaintance
in
charlestown
when
peter
had
scrubbed
the
parts
of
him
that
showed
most
and
had
performed
what
he
considered
his
whole
duty
to
his
hair
he
appeared
for
the
first
time
at
the
family
table
in
such
a
guise
that
if
the
children
had
not
been
warned
they
would
have
gone
into
hysterics
but
he
gradually
grew
to
be
proud
of
his
toilets
and
careful
that
they
should
not
occur
too
often
in
the
same
day
since
it
appeared
to
be
the
family
opinion
that
he
should
make
them
himself
there
was
a
tacit
feeling
not
always
expressed
that
nancy
after
mother
held
the
reins
of
authority
and
also
that
she
was
a
person
of
infinite
resource
the
had
been
her
father
name
for
her
but
he
had
never
thought
of
her
as
a
a
gallant
adventurer
into
unknown
and
untried
regions
because
there
had
been
small
opportunity
to
test
her
courage
or
her
ingenuity
carey
often
found
herself
leaning
on
nancy
nowadays
not
as
a
dead
weight
but
with
just
the
hint
of
need
just
the
suggestion
of
confidence
that
youth
and
strength
and
buoyancy
respond
to
so
gladly
it
had
been
decided
that
the
house
should
be
vacated
as
soon
as
a
tenant
could
be
found
but
the
what
next
had
not
been
settled
julia
had
confirmed
nancy
worst
fears
by
accepting
her
aunt
offer
of
a
home
but
had
requested
time
to
make
gladys
ferguson
a
short
visit
at
palm
beach
all
expenses
being
borne
by
the
parents
of
gladys
this
estimable
lady
and
gentleman
had
no
other
names
or
titles
and
were
never
spoken
of
as
if
they
had
any
separate
existence
they
had
lived
and
loved
and
married
and
accumulated
vast
wealth
and
borne
gladys
after
that
they
had
sunk
into
the
background
and
gladys
had
taken
the
stage
i
sure
i
glad
she
is
going
to
the
fergusons
exclaimed
kathleen
one
month
less
of
her
yes
nancy
replied
but
she
be
much
worse
more
spoiled
more
vain
more
luxurious
than
before
she
want
a
gold
chicken
breast
now
we
just
packed
away
the
finger
bowls
but
out
they
have
to
come
again
let
her
wash
her
own
finger
bowl
a
few
days
and
she
clamor
for
the
simple
life
said
kathleen
shrewdly
oh
what
a
relief
if
the
fergusons
would
adopt
julia
just
to
keep
gladys
company
nobody
would
ever
adopt
julia
returned
nancy
if
she
was
yours
you
could
help
it
you
just
take
her
the
lord
in
prayer
as
the
hymn
says
but
you
never
go
out
and
adopt
her
matters
were
in
this
uncertain
and
unsettled
state
when
nancy
came
into
her
mother
room
one
evening
when
the
rest
of
the
house
was
asleep
i
saw
your
light
so
i
knew
you
were
reading
muddy
i
had
such
a
bright
idea
i
could
rest
muddy
is
not
an
attractive
name
unless
you
happen
to
know
its
true
derivation
and
significance
first
there
was
mother
dear
and
as
persons
under
fifteen
are
always
pressed
for
time
and
uniformly
breathless
this
appellation
was
shortened
to
motherdy
and
peter
being
unable
to
struggle
with
that
term
had
abbreviated
it
into
muddy
muddy
in
itself
is
undistinguished
and
even
unpleasant
but
when
accompanied
by
a
close
strangling
hug
pats
on
the
cheek
and
ardent
if
somewhat
sticky
kisses
grows
by
degrees
to
possess
delightful
associations
mother
carey
enjoyed
it
so
much
from
peter
that
she
even
permitted
it
to
be
taken
up
by
the
elder
children
you
must
have
ideas
after
nine
nancy
chided
her
mother
wrap
the
blue
blanket
around
you
and
sit
down
with
me
near
the
fire
you
not
to
say
i
romantic
or
unpractical
insisted
nancy
leaning
against
her
mother
knees
and
looking
up
into
her
face
indeed
you
not
to
say
anything
of
any
importance
till
i
all
finished
going
to
tell
it
in
a
long
story
too
so
as
to
work
on
your
feelings
and
make
you
say
yes
very
well
i
all
ears
now
put
on
your
thinking
cap
do
you
remember
once
years
and
years
ago
before
peter
it
was
that
father
took
us
on
a
driving
trip
through
some
dear
little
villages
in
maine
the
careys
never
dated
their
happenings
eighteen
hundred
and
anything
it
was
always
just
before
peter
immediately
after
peter
or
a
long
time
after
peter
which
answered
all
purposes
i
remember
it
was
one
of
gilbert
thirsty
days
and
we
stopped
at
nearly
every
convenient
pump
to
give
him
drinks
of
water
and
at
noon
we
came
to
the
loveliest
wayside
well
with
a
real
bucket
do
you
remember
i
remember
and
we
all
clambered
out
and
father
said
it
was
time
for
luncheon
and
we
unpacked
the
baskets
on
the
greensward
near
a
beautiful
tree
and
father
said
spread
the
table
too
near
the
house
dears
or
they
cry
when
they
see
our
doughnuts
and
kitty
who
had
been
running
about
came
up
and
cried
an
empty
house
come
and
look
i
remember
and
we
all
went
in
the
gate
and
loved
every
bit
of
it
the
stone
steps
the
hollyhocks
growing
under
the
windows
the
yellow
paint
and
the
green
blinds
and
father
looked
in
the
windows
and
the
rooms
were
large
and
sunny
and
we
wanted
to
drive
the
horse
into
the
barn
and
stay
there
forever
i
remember
and
gilbert
tore
his
trousers
climbing
on
the
gate
and
father
laid
him
upside
down
on
your
lap
and
i
ran
and
got
your
and
you
mended
the
seat
of
his
little
trousers
and
father
looked
and
looked
at
the
house
and
said
its
heart
and
said
if
he
were
rich
he
would
buy
the
dear
thing
that
afternoon
and
sleep
in
it
that
night
and
asked
you
if
you
did
wish
you
married
the
other
man
and
you
said
there
never
was
another
man
and
you
asked
father
if
he
thought
on
the
whole
that
he
was
the
poorest
man
in
the
world
and
father
said
no
the
very
richest
and
he
kissed
us
all
round
do
you
remember
do
i
remember
o
nancy
nancy
what
do
you
think
i
am
made
of
that
i
could
ever
forget
do
cry
muddy
darling
do
it
was
so
beautiful
and
we
have
so
many
things
like
that
to
remember
yes
said
carey
i
know
it
part
of
my
tears
are
grateful
ones
that
none
of
you
can
ever
recall
an
unloving
word
between
your
father
and
mother
the
idea
said
nancy
suddenly
and
briefly
is
to
go
and
live
in
that
darling
house
nancy
what
for
we
got
to
leave
this
place
and
where
could
we
live
on
less
than
in
that
tiny
village
it
had
a
beautiful
academy
do
you
remember
so
we
could
go
to
school
there
kathleen
and
i
anyway
if
you
could
get
enough
money
to
keep
gilly
at
eastover
of
course
i
thought
of
the
country
but
that
spot
never
occurred
to
me
what
was
its
quaint
little
name
mizpah
or
shiloh
or
deborah
or
something
like
that
it
was
beulah
said
nancy
and
father
thought
it
exactly
matched
the
place
we
even
named
the
house
recalled
mother
carey
with
a
tearful
smile
there
were
vegetables
growing
behind
it
and
flowers
in
front
and
your
father
suggested
garden
and
i
chose
happy
but
father
thought
the
fields
that
stretched
back
of
the
vegetable
garden
might
belong
to
the
place
and
if
so
there
would
be
far
more
than
a
of
land
and
do
you
remember
father
said
he
wished
we
could
do
something
to
thank
the
house
for
our
happy
hour
and
i
thought
of
the
little
box
of
plants
we
had
bought
at
a
wayside
nursery
oh
i
do
indeed
i
had
thought
of
it
for
years
father
and
you
planted
a
tiny
crimson
rambler
at
the
corner
of
the
piazza
at
the
side
do
you
suppose
it
ever
muddy
because
it
would
be
ever
so
high
now
and
full
of
roses
in
summer
i
wonder
mused
mother
carey
oh
it
was
a
sweet
tranquil
restful
place
i
wonder
how
we
could
find
out
about
it
it
seems
impossible
that
it
should
not
have
been
rented
or
sold
before
this
let
me
see
that
was
five
years
ago
there
was
a
nice
old
gentleman
farther
down
the
street
quite
in
the
village
somebody
who
had
known
father
when
he
was
a
boy
so
there
was
he
had
a
quaint
little
law
office
not
much
larger
than
peter
playhouse
perhaps
we
could
find
him
he
was
very
very
old
he
may
not
be
alive
and
i
can
not
remember
his
name
father
called
him
i
know
that
oh
how
i
wish
dear
addy
was
here
to
help
us
if
he
were
he
would
want
to
help
us
too
much
we
must
learn
to
bear
our
own
burdens
they
wo
seem
so
strange
and
heavy
when
we
are
more
used
to
them
now
go
to
bed
dear
we
think
of
beulah
you
and
i
and
perhaps
as
we
have
been
all
adrift
waiting
for
a
wind
to
stir
our
sails
idea
will
be
the
thing
to
start
us
on
our
new
voyage
beulah
means
land
of
promise
that
a
good
omen
and
father
found
beulah
and
father
found
the
house
and
father
blessed
it
and
loved
it
and
named
it
that
makes
ever
so
many
more
good
omens
more
than
enough
to
start
housekeeping
on
nancy
answered
kissing
her
mother
goodnight
vii
old
beasts
into
new
mother
carey
went
to
sleep
that
night
in
greater
peace
than
she
had
felt
for
months
it
had
seemed
to
her
all
these
last
sad
weeks
as
though
she
and
her
brood
had
been
breasting
stormy
waters
with
no
harbor
in
sight
there
were
friends
in
plenty
here
and
there
but
no
kith
and
kin
and
the
problems
to
be
settled
were
graver
and
more
complex
than
ordinary
friendship
could
untangle
vexed
as
it
always
was
by
its
own
problems
she
had
but
one
keen
desire
to
go
to
some
quiet
place
where
temptations
for
spending
money
would
be
as
few
as
possible
and
there
live
for
three
or
four
years
putting
her
heart
and
mind
and
soul
on
fitting
the
children
for
life
if
she
could
keep
strength
enough
to
guide
and
guard
train
and
develop
them
into
happy
useful
agreeable
human
beings
masters
of
their
own
powers
wise
and
discreet
enough
when
years
of
discretion
were
reached
to
choose
right
paths
that
she
conceived
was
her
chief
task
in
life
and
no
easy
one
happy
i
must
contrive
that
they
shall
be
she
thought
for
unhappiness
and
discontent
are
among
the
foxes
that
spoil
the
vines
stupid
they
shall
not
be
while
i
can
think
of
any
force
to
stir
their
brains
they
have
ordinary
intelligence
all
of
them
and
they
shall
learn
to
use
it
dull
and
sleepy
children
i
ca
abide
fairly
good
they
will
be
if
they
are
busy
and
happy
and
clever
enough
to
see
the
folly
of
being
anything
good
and
so
month
after
month
for
many
years
to
come
i
must
be
helping
nancy
and
kathleen
to
be
the
right
sort
of
women
and
wives
and
mothers
and
gilbert
and
peter
the
proper
kind
of
men
and
husbands
and
fathers
mother
carey
chickens
must
be
able
to
show
the
good
birds
the
way
home
as
the
admiral
said
and
i
should
think
they
ought
to
be
able
to
set
a
few
bad
birds
on
the
right
track
now
and
then
well
all
this
would
be
a
task
to
frighten
and
stagger
many
a
person
but
it
only
kindled
carey
love
and
courage
to
a
white
heat
do
you
remember
where
kingsley
redoubtable
tom
the
water
baby
swims
past
shiny
wall
and
reaches
at
last
peacepool
peacepool
where
the
good
whales
lie
waiting
till
mother
carey
shall
send
for
them
to
make
them
out
of
old
beasts
into
new
tom
swims
up
to
the
nearest
whale
and
asks
the
way
to
mother
carey
there
she
is
in
the
middle
says
the
whale
though
tom
sees
nothing
but
a
glittering
white
peak
like
an
iceberg
that
mother
carey
spouts
the
whale
as
you
will
find
if
you
get
to
her
there
she
sits
making
old
beasts
into
new
all
the
year
round
how
does
she
do
that
asks
tom
that
her
concern
not
mine
the
whale
remarks
discreetly
and
when
tom
came
nearer
to
the
white
glittering
peak
it
took
the
form
of
something
like
a
lovely
woman
sitting
on
a
white
marble
throne
and
from
the
foot
of
the
throne
you
remember
there
swam
away
out
and
out
into
the
sea
millions
of
creatures
of
more
shapes
and
colors
than
man
ever
dreamed
and
they
were
mother
carey
children
whom
she
makes
all
day
long
tom
expected
i
am
still
telling
you
what
happened
to
the
famous
water
baby
tom
expected
like
some
grown
people
who
ought
to
know
better
that
he
would
find
mother
carey
snipping
piecing
fitting
stitching
cobbling
basting
filing
planing
hammering
turning
polishing
moulding
measuring
chiselling
clipping
and
so
forth
as
men
do
when
they
go
to
work
to
make
anything
but
instead
of
that
she
sat
quite
still
with
her
chin
upon
her
hand
looking
down
into
the
sea
with
two
great
blue
eyes
as
blue
as
the
sea
itself
as
blue
as
our
own
blue
velvet
bonnet
kitty
would
have
said
was
beulah
the
right
place
wondered
carey
as
she
dropped
asleep
and
all
night
long
she
heard
in
dreams
the
voice
of
that
shining
little
river
that
ran
under
the
bridge
near
beulah
village
and
all
night
long
she
walked
in
fields
of
buttercups
and
daisies
and
saw
the
june
breeze
blow
the
tall
grasses
she
entered
the
yellow
painted
house
and
put
the
children
to
bed
in
the
different
rooms
and
the
instant
she
saw
them
sleeping
there
it
became
home
and
her
heart
put
out
little
roots
that
were
like
tendrils
but
they
grew
so
fast
that
by
morning
they
held
the
yellow
house
fast
and
refused
to
let
it
go
she
looked
from
its
windows
onto
the
gardens
fore
and
aft
and
they
seemed
like
the
rest
of
little
beulah
village
full
of
sweet
promise
in
the
back
were
all
sorts
of
good
things
to
eat
growing
in
profusion
but
modestly
out
of
sight
and
in
front
where
could
see
their
beauty
and
sniff
their
fragrance
posies
bloomed
and
rioted
and
tossed
gay
perfumed
heads
in
the
sunshine
she
awoke
refreshed
and
strong
and
brave
not
the
same
woman
who
took
nancy
idea
to
bed
with
her
for
this
woman
heart
and
hope
had
somehow
flown
from
the
brick
house
in
charlestown
and
had
built
itself
a
new
nest
in
beulah
green
trees
the
elms
and
willows
that
overhung
the
shining
river
an
idea
of
her
own
ran
out
and
met
nancy
half
way
instead
of
going
herself
to
spy
out
the
land
of
beulah
why
not
send
gilbert
it
was
a
short
inexpensive
railway
journey
with
no
change
of
cars
gilbert
was
nearly
fourteen
and
thus
far
seemed
to
have
no
notion
of
life
as
a
difficult
enterprise
no
mother
who
respects
her
boy
or
respects
herself
can
ask
him
flatly
do
you
intend
to
grow
up
with
the
idea
of
taking
care
of
me
of
having
an
eye
to
your
sisters
or
do
you
consider
that
since
i
brought
you
into
the
world
i
must
provide
both
for
myself
and
you
until
you
are
a
man
or
forever
and
a
day
after
if
you
feel
inclined
to
shirk
your
part
in
the
affair
gilbert
talked
of
his
college
course
as
confidently
as
he
had
before
his
father
death
it
was
nancy
who
as
the
eldest
seemed
the
head
of
the
family
but
gilbert
only
a
year
or
so
her
junior
ought
to
grow
into
the
head
somehow
or
other
the
way
to
begin
would
be
to
give
him
a
few
delightful
responsibilities
such
as
would
appeal
to
his
pride
and
sense
of
importance
and
gradually
to
mingle
with
them
certain
duties
of
headship
neither
so
simple
nor
so
agreeable
beulah
would
be
a
delightful
beginning
nancy
the
pathfinder
would
have
packed
a
bag
and
gone
to
beulah
on
an
hour
notice
found
the
dealer
in
case
there
was
such
a
metropolitan
article
in
the
village
looked
up
her
father
old
friend
the
colonel
with
the
forgotten
surname
discovered
the
owner
of
the
charming
house
rented
it
and
brought
back
the
key
in
triumph
but
nancy
was
a
girl
rich
in
courage
and
enterprise
while
gilbert
manliness
and
leadership
and
discretion
and
consideration
for
others
needed
a
vigorous
decisive
continued
push
if
nancy
idea
was
good
mother
carey
idea
matched
it
to
see
gilbert
valise
in
hand
eight
dollars
in
pocket
leaving
charlestown
on
a
friday
noon
after
school
was
equal
to
watching
columbus
depart
for
an
unknown
land
thrilling
is
the
only
word
that
will
properly
describe
it
and
the
group
that
followed
his
departure
from
the
upper
windows
used
it
freely
and
generously
he
had
gone
gayly
downstairs
and
nancy
flung
after
him
a
small
packet
in
an
envelope
just
as
he
reached
the
door
there
a
photograph
of
your
mother
and
sisters
she
called
in
case
the
owner
refuses
to
rent
the
house
to
just
show
him
the
rest
of
the
family
and
do
forget
to
say
that
the
rent
is
exorbitant
whatever
it
is
they
watched
him
go
jauntily
down
the
street
mother
carey
with
special
pride
in
her
eyes
he
had
on
his
second
best
suit
and
it
looked
well
on
his
straight
slim
figure
he
had
a
gallant
air
had
gilbert
and
one
could
not
truly
say
it
was
surface
gallantry
either
it
simply
did
not
at
present
go
very
deep
no
one
could
call
him
anything
but
a
fine
boy
thought
the
mother
and
surely
the
outside
is
a
key
to
what
is
within
his
firm
chin
his
erect
head
his
bright
eye
his
quick
tread
his
air
of
alert
surely
here
is
enough
for
any
mother
to
build
on
viii
the
knight
of
beulah
castle
nancy
flushed
face
was
glued
to
the
until
gilbert
turned
the
corner
he
looked
back
took
off
his
cap
threw
a
kiss
to
them
and
was
out
of
sight
oh
how
i
wish
could
have
gone
cried
nancy
i
hope
he
forget
what
he
went
for
i
hope
he
wo
take
for
an
answer
oh
why
was
i
a
boy
carey
laughed
as
she
turned
from
the
window
it
will
be
a
great
adventure
for
the
man
of
the
house
nancy
so
never
mind
what
would
the
pathfinder
have
done
if
she
had
gone
instead
of
her
brother
i
oh
millions
of
things
said
nancy
pacing
the
floor
her
head
bent
a
little
her
hands
behind
her
back
i
should
be
going
to
the
new
railway
station
in
boston
now
and
presently
i
should
be
at
the
little
grated
window
asking
for
a
return
ticket
to
greentown
station
ten
the
man
would
say
and
i
would
fling
my
whole
eight
dollars
in
front
of
the
wicket
to
show
him
what
manner
of
person
i
was
then
i
would
pick
up
the
three
dollars
and
ninety
cents
or
thereabouts
and
turn
away
car
seat
miss
the
young
man
would
say
a
warm
worried
young
man
in
a
seersucker
coat
and
i
would
answer
thank
you
i
always
go
in
the
common
car
to
study
human
nature
that
what
the
admiral
says
but
of
course
the
ticket
man
could
know
that
the
admiral
is
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
and
would
think
i
said
it
myself
then
i
would
go
down
the
platform
and
take
the
common
car
for
greentown
soon
we
would
be
off
and
i
would
ask
the
conductor
if
greentown
was
the
station
where
one
could
change
and
drive
to
beulah
darling
little
beulah
beulah
not
breathing
a
word
about
the
yellow
house
for
fear
he
would
jump
off
the
train
and
rent
it
first
then
he
would
say
he
never
heard
of
beulah
i
would
look
pityingly
at
him
but
make
no
reply
because
it
would
be
no
use
and
anyway
i
know
greentown
the
changing
place
because
i
asked
three
men
before
but
cousin
ann
always
likes
to
make
conductors
acknowledge
they
know
as
much
as
she
does
then
i
present
a
few
peanuts
or
peppermints
to
a
small
boy
and
hold
an
infant
for
a
tired
mother
because
this
is
what
good
children
do
in
the
books
but
i
do
not
mingle
much
with
the
passengers
because
my
brow
is
furrowed
with
thought
and
i
am
travelling
on
important
business
you
can
well
imagine
that
by
this
time
mother
carey
has
taken
out
her
darning
and
kathleen
her
oversewing
to
which
she
pays
little
attention
because
she
so
adores
nancy
tales
peter
has
sat
like
a
small
statue
ever
since
his
quick
ear
caught
the
sound
of
a
story
his
eyes
follow
nancy
as
she
walks
up
and
down
improvising
and
the
only
interruption
she
ever
receives
from
her
audience
is
kathleen
or
mother
occasional
laugh
at
some
especially
ridiculous
sentence
the
hours
fly
by
like
minutes
continues
nancy
stopping
by
the
side
window
and
twirling
the
curtain
tassel
absently
i
scan
the
surrounding
country
to
see
if
anything
compares
with
beulah
and
nothing
does
no
such
river
no
such
trees
no
such
well
no
such
old
oaken
bucket
and
above
all
no
such
yellow
house
all
the
other
houses
i
see
are
but
as
huts
compared
with
the
yellow
house
of
beulah
soon
the
car
door
opens
a
brakeman
looks
in
and
calls
in
a
rich
baritone
voice
greentown
in
the
car
and
if
you
know
beforehand
what
he
is
going
to
say
you
can
understand
him
quite
nicely
so
i
take
up
my
bag
and
go
down
the
aisle
with
dignity
lively
miss
cries
the
brakeman
but
i
do
not
heed
him
it
is
not
likely
that
a
person
renting
country
houses
will
move
save
with
majesty
alighting
i
inquire
if
there
is
any
conveyance
for
beulah
and
there
is
a
wagon
and
a
white
horse
i
ask
the
driver
boldly
to
drive
me
to
the
office
he
does
not
ask
which
colonel
or
what
colonel
he
simply
says
foster
i
and
i
say
we
arrive
at
the
office
and
when
i
introduce
myself
as
captain
carey
daughter
i
receive
a
glad
welcome
the
colonel
rings
a
bell
and
an
aged
beldame
approaches
making
a
deep
curtsy
and
offering
me
a
beaker
of
milk
a
crusty
loaf
a
few
venison
pasties
and
a
cold
goose
stuffed
with
humming
birds
when
i
have
reduced
these
to
nothingness
i
ask
if
the
yellow
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
is
still
vacant
and
the
colonel
replies
that
it
is
at
which
unexpected
but
answer
i
fall
into
a
deep
swoon
when
i
awake
the
aged
colonel
is
bending
over
me
his
long
white
goat
beard
tickling
my
chin
mother
carey
stops
her
darning
now
and
kathleen
makes
no
pretence
of
sewing
the
story
is
fast
approaching
its
climax
everybody
feels
that
including
peter
who
hopes
that
he
will
be
in
it
in
some
guise
or
other
before
it
ends
thou
married
lady
the
aged
one
asks
courteously
if
not
wilt
thou
be
mine
i
tremble
because
he
does
not
seem
to
notice
that
he
is
eighty
or
ninety
and
i
but
fifteen
yet
i
fear
if
i
reject
him
too
scornfully
and
speedily
the
yellow
house
will
never
be
mine
me
a
little
time
in
which
to
fit
myself
for
this
great
honor
i
say
modestly
and
a
mighty
good
idea
too
that
i
got
out
of
a
book
the
other
day
when
suddenly
as
i
gaze
upward
my
suitor
white
hair
turns
to
brown
his
beard
drops
off
his
wrinkles
disappear
and
he
stands
before
me
a
young
knight
in
full
armor
go
to
the
yellow
castle
with
me
sweet
lady
he
asks
i
cry
in
ecstasy
and
we
leap
on
the
back
of
a
charger
hitched
to
the
colonel
horseblock
we
dash
down
the
avenue
of
elms
and
maples
that
line
the
village
street
and
we
are
at
our
journey
end
before
the
knight
has
had
time
to
explain
to
me
that
he
was
changed
into
the
guise
of
an
old
man
by
an
evil
sorcerer
some
years
before
and
could
never
return
to
his
own
person
until
some
one
appeared
who
wished
to
live
in
the
yellow
house
which
is
beulah
castle
we
approach
the
spot
and
the
little
picket
gate
and
the
knight
lifts
me
from
the
charger
back
are
house
and
lands
and
all
are
yours
sweet
lady
if
you
have
a
younger
brother
there
is
treasure
hidden
in
the
ground
behind
the
castle
and
no
one
ever
finds
such
things
save
younger
brothers
have
a
younger
brother
i
cry
his
name
is
at
this
point
in
nancy
chronicle
peter
is
nearly
beside
himself
with
excitement
he
has
been
sitting
on
his
hassock
his
hands
outspread
upon
his
fat
knees
his
lips
parted
his
eyes
shining
somewhere
sometime
in
nancy
stories
there
is
always
a
peter
he
lives
for
that
moment
nancy
stifling
her
laughter
goes
on
rapidly
and
so
the
knight
summons
younger
brother
peter
to
come
and
he
flies
in
a
great
air
ship
from
charlestown
to
beulah
and
when
he
arrives
the
knight
asks
him
to
dig
for
the
buried
treasure
peter
here
turns
up
his
sleeves
to
his
dimpled
elbows
and
seizes
an
imaginary
implement
peter
goes
to
the
back
of
the
castle
and
there
is
a
beautiful
garden
filled
with
corn
and
beans
and
peas
and
lettuce
and
potatoes
and
beets
and
onions
and
turnips
and
carrots
and
parsnips
and
tomatoes
and
cabbages
he
takes
his
magic
spade
and
it
leads
him
to
the
cabbages
he
digs
and
digs
and
in
a
moment
the
spade
strikes
metal
has
found
the
gold
cries
the
knight
and
peter
speedily
lifts
from
the
ground
pots
and
pots
of
ducats
and
florins
and
gulden
and
doubloons
peter
nods
his
head
at
the
mention
of
each
precious
coin
and
then
claps
his
hands
and
hugs
himself
with
joy
and
rocks
himself
to
and
fro
on
the
hassock
in
his
ecstasy
at
being
the
little
god
in
the
machine
then
down
the
village
street
there
is
the
sound
of
hurrying
feet
and
in
a
twinkling
a
gayly
painted
chariot
comes
into
view
and
in
it
are
sitting
the
queen
mother
and
the
crown
prince
and
princess
of
the
house
of
carey
they
alight
peter
meets
them
at
the
gate
a
pot
of
gold
in
each
hand
they
enter
the
castle
and
put
their
umbrellas
in
one
corner
of
the
front
hall
and
their
rubbers
in
the
other
one
behind
the
door
lady
nancibel
trips
up
the
steps
after
them
and
turning
says
graciously
to
her
knight
you
just
as
soon
marry
somebody
else
i
am
very
much
attached
to
my
family
and
they
will
need
me
dreadfully
while
they
are
getting
settled
did
not
recall
the
fact
that
i
had
asked
you
to
be
mine
courteously
answers
the
youth
did
she
responds
very
much
embarrassed
as
she
supposed
of
course
he
would
remember
his
offer
made
when
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
goat
beard
gladly
will
i
forget
all
if
you
will
relinquish
my
hand
you
please
answers
the
knight
generously
can
deny
you
nothing
when
i
remember
you
have
brought
me
back
my
youth
prithee
is
the
other
lady
bespoke
she
of
the
golden
hair
have
asked
but
i
have
chosen
none
answers
the
crown
princess
kitty
modestly
as
is
her
wont
you
will
do
nicely
says
the
knight
all
i
wish
is
to
be
to
the
queen
mother
you

my
hearty
cries
prince
gilbert
de
carey
as
we
much
do
need
a
hand
at
the
i
will
gladly
give
my
sister
in
marriage
so
they
all
went
into
beulah
castle
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
and
there
they
lived
in
great
happiness
and
comfort
all
the
days
of
their
lives
and
there
they
died
when
it
came
their
time
and
they
were
all
buried
by
the
shores
of
the
shining
river
of
beulah
oh
it
is
perfectly
splendid
cried
kathleen
about
the
best
one
you
ever
told
but
do
change
the
end
a
bit
nancy
dear
it
dreadful
for
him
to
marry
kitty
when
he
chose
nancibel
first
i
like
him
awfully
but
i
do
want
to
take
him
that
way
well
how
would
this
do
and
nancy
pondered
a
moment
before
going
on
you
are
my
hearty
cries
prince
gilbert
de
carey
as
we
do
need
a
hand
at
the
i
will
gladly
give
my
sister
in
marriage
cries
the
queen
mother
is
not
as
it
should
be
in
this
coil
how
can
you
tell
she
says
turning
to
the
knightly
stranger
memory
will
not
awake
one
day
and
you
recall
the
adoration
you
felt
when
you
first
beheld
the
lady
nancibel
in
a
deep
swoon
the
young
knight
eyes
took
on
a
look
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
comes
back
to
me
now
he
sighed
did
love
the
lady
nancibel
passionately
and
i
can
not
think
how
it
slipped
my
mind
release
you
willingly
exclaimed
the
crown
princess
kitty
haughtily
a
million
suitors
await
my
nod
and
thou
wert
never
really
mine
the
other
lady
rejects
me
also
responds
the
luckless
youth
the
tears
flowing
from
his
eagle
eyes
onto
his
crimson
mantle
delay
the
nuptials
until
i
am
eighteen
and
the
castle
is
set
in
order
asks
the
lady
nancibel
relentingly
it
must
be
i
do
pledge
thee
my
vow
to
wait
says
the
knight
i
do
beg
the
fair
one
with
the
golden
locks
to
consider
the
claims
of
my
brother
not
my
equal
perhaps
but
still
a
gallant
youth
will
enter
him
on
my
waiting
list
as
number
three
hundred
and
seventeen
responds
the
crown
princess
kitty
than
whom
no
violet
could
be
more
shy
tis
all
he
can
expect
and
more
than
i
should
promise
so
they
all
lived
in
the
yellow
castle
in
great
happiness
forever
after
and
were
buried
by
the
shores
of
the
shining
river
of
beulah
does
that
suit
you
better
simply
lovely
cried
kitty
and
the
bit
about
my
modesty
is
too
funny
for
words
oh
if
some
of
it
would
only
happen
but
i
am
afraid
gilbert
will
not
stir
up
any
fairy
stories
and
set
them
going
some
of
it
will
happen
exclaimed
peter
i
shall
dig
every
single
day
till
i
find
the
you
are
a
pot
of
gold
yourself
filled
full
and
running
over
now
nancy
run
and
write
down
your
fairy
tale
while
you
remember
it
said
mother
carey
it
is
as
good
an
exercise
as
any
other
and
you
still
tell
a
story
far
better
than
you
write
it
nancy
did
this
sort
of
improvising
every
now
and
then
and
had
done
it
from
earliest
childhood
and
sometimes
of
late
mother
carey
looked
at
her
eldest
chicken
and
wondered
if
after
all
she
had
hatched
in
her
a
bird
of
brighter
plumage
or
rarer
song
than
the
rest
or
a
young
eagle
whose
strong
wings
would
bear
her
to
a
higher
flight
ix
gilbert
embassy
the
new
station
had
just
been
built
in
boston
and
it
seemed
a
great
enterprise
to
gilbert
to
be
threading
his
way
through
the
enormous
spaces
getting
his
information
by
his
own
wits
and
not
asking
questions
like
a
stupid
schoolboy
like
all
children
of
naval
officers
the
careys
had
travelled
ever
since
their
birth
still
this
was
gilbert
first
journey
alone
and
nobody
was
ever
more
conscious
of
the
situation
nor
more
anxious
to
carry
it
off
effectively
he
entered
the
car
opened
his
bag
took
out
his
travelling
cap
and
his
copy
of
ben
hur
then
threw
the
bag
in
a
lordly
way
into
the
brass
rack
above
the
seat
he
opened
his
book
but
immediately
became
interested
in
a
young
couple
just
in
front
of
him
they
were
carefully
dressed
even
to
details
of
hats
and
gloves
and
they
had
an
unmistakable
air
of
wedding
journey
about
them
that
interested
the
curious
boy
presently
the
conductor
came
in
pausing
in
front
of
the
groom
he
said
tickets

the
wrong
train
wrong

this
to
a
pretty
girl
on
the
opposite
side
from
gilbert
a
pink
and
white
unsophisticated
maiden
very
much
interested
in
the
woes
of
the
bride
and
groom
and
entirely
sympathetic
with
the
groom
helpless
wrath
on
the
wrong
train
miss
said
the
conductor
on
the
wrong
train
she
spoke
in
a
tone
of
anguish
getting
up
and
catching
her
valise
frantically
it
be
the
wrong
train
it
the
white
mountain
train
yes

but

this

express
train

stops
at
lowell
where
this
gentleman
is
going
here
the
conductor
gave
a
sportive
wink
at
the
bridegroom
who
had
an
appointment
in
lawrence
the
pretty
girl
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
turned
her
face
despairingly
to
the
window
while
the
bride
talked
to
the
groom
excitedly
about
what
they
ought
to
have
done
and
what
they
would
have
done
had
she
been
consulted
gilbert
could
hardly
conceal
his
enjoyment
of
the
situation
and
indeed
everybody
within
hearing
that
is
anybody
who
chanced
to
be
on
the
right
train
looked
at
the
bride
and
groom
and
the
pretty
girl
and
tittered
audibly
why
do
people
make
inquiries
thought
gilbert
superciliously
perhaps
they
have
never
been
anywhere
before
but
even
no
excuse
he
handed
his
ticket
to
the
conductor
with
a
broad
smile
saying
in
an
undertone
what
kind
of
passengers
are
we
carrying
this
afternoon
the
usual
kind
i
guess
you
on
the
wrong
train
sonny
gilbert
almost
leaped
into
the
air
and
committed
himself
by
making
a
motion
to
reach
down
his
valise
i
on
the
wrong
train
he
asked
haughtily
that
be
so
the
ticket
agent
told
me
the
was
the
only
fast
train
to
greentown
mebbe
he
thought
you
said
greenville
this
train
goes
to
greenville
if
that
do
you
folks
ai
used
to
the
new
station
yet
and
the
ticket
agents
are
all
bran
new
too
guess
you
got
hold
of
a
tenderfoot
but
greenville
will
for
me
exclaimed
gilbert
i
want
to
go
to
well
get
off
at
lowell
the
first
stop
you
know
when
you
come
to
it
because
this
gentleman
that
wanted
to
go
to
lawrence
will
get
off
there
and
this
young
lady
that
was
intendin
to
go
to
north
conway
there
be
four
of
you
jest
a
nice
party
gilbert
choked
with
wrath
as
he
saw
the
mirth
of
the
other
passengers
what
train
shall
i
be
able
to
take
to
greentown
he
managed
to
call
after
the
conductor
do
know
sonny
ask
the
ticket
agent
in
the
lowell
deepot
he
an
old
hand
and
he
know
gilbert
pride
was
terribly
wounded
but
his
spirits
rose
a
little
later
when
he
found
that
he
would
only
have
to
wait
twenty
minutes
in
the
lowell
station
before
a
slow
train
for
greentown
would
pick
him
up
and
that
he
should
still
reach
his
destination
before
bedtime
and
need
never
disclose
his
stupidity
after
all
this
proved
to
be
his
only
error
for
everything
moved
smoothly
from
that
moment
and
he
was
as
prudent
and
successful
an
ambassador
as
mother
carey
could
have
chosen
he
found
the
colonel
whose
name
was
not
foster
by
the
way
but
wheeler
and
the
colonel
would
not
allow
him
to
go
to
the
mansion
house
beulah
one
small
hotel
but
insisted
that
he
should
be
his
guest
that
evening
he
heard
from
the
colonel
the
history
of
the
yellow
house
and
the
next
morning
the
colonel
drove
him
to
the
store
of
the
man
who
had
charge
of
it
during
the
owner
absence
in
europe
after
which
gilbert
was
conducted
in
due
form
to
the
premises
for
a
critical
examination
the
yellow
house
as
garden
seemed
destined
to
be
chiefly
called
was
indeed
the
only
house
of
that
color
for
ten
miles
square
it
had
belonged
to
the
various
branches
of
a
certain
family
of
hamiltons
for
fifty
years
or
more
but
in
course
of
time
when
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
lemuel
hamiltons
it
had
no
sort
of
relation
to
their
mode
of
existence
one
summer
a
year
or
two
before
the
careys
had
seen
it
the
sons
and
daughters
had
come
on
from
boston
and
begged
their
father
to
let
them
put
it
in
such
order
that
they
could
take
house
parties
of
young
people
there
for
the
week
end
hamilton
indulgently
allowed
them
a
certain
amount
to
be
expended
as
they
wished
and
with
the
help
of
a
local
carpenter
they
succeeded
in
doing
several
things
to
their
own
complete
satisfaction
though
it
could
not
be
said
that
they
added
to
the
value
of
the
property
the
house
they
regarded
merely
as
a
place
and
after
they
had
painted
some
bedroom
floors
set
up
some
cots
bought
a
kitchen
stove
and
some
pine
tables
and
chairs
they
regarded
that
part
of
the
difficulty
as
solved
expending
the
rest
of
the
money
in
turning
the
dilapidated
barn
into
a
place
where
they
could
hold
high
revels
of
various
innocent
sorts
the
two
freshman
sons
two
daughters
and
a
married
sister
barely
old
enough
to
chaperon
her
own
baby
brought
parties
of
gay
young
friends
with
them
several
weeks
in
succession
these
excursions
were
a
great
delight
to
the
villagers
who
thus
enjoyed
all
the
pleasures
and
excitements
of
a
circus
with
none
of
its
attendant
expenses
they
were
of
short
duration
however
for
lemuel
hamilton
was
appointed
consul
to
a
foreign
port
and
took
his
wife
and
daughters
with
him
the
married
sister
died
and
in
course
of
time
one
of
the
sons
went
to
china
to
learn
and
the
other
established
himself
on
a
ranch
in
texas
thus
the
lemuel
hamiltons
were
scattered
far
and
wide
and
as
the
yellow
house
in
beulah
had
small
value
as
real
estate
and
had
never
played
any
part
in
their
lives
it
was
almost
forgotten
as
the
busy
years
went
by
hamilton
told
me
four
years
ago
when
i
went
up
to
boston
to
meet
him
that
if
i
could
get
any
rent
from
respectable
parties
i
might
let
the
house
though
he
would
lay
out
a
cent
on
repairs
in
order
to
get
a
tenant
but
land
there
ai
no
call
for
houses
in
beulah
nor
hai
been
for
twenty
years
so
bill
harmon
the
storekeeper
told
gilbert
the
house
has
got
a
tight
roof
and
good
underpinnin
and
if
your
folks
feel
like
payin
out
a
little
money
for
paint
paper
you
can
fix
it
up
neat
a
pin
the
hamilton
boys
jest
raised
cain
out
in
the
barn
so
you
ca
keep
no
critters
there
we
could
have
a
horse
or
a
cow
anyway
said
gilbert
well
it
lucky
you
ca
i
could
rented
the
house
twice
over
if
there
been
any
barn
room
but
them
confounded
young
scalawags
ripped
out
the
horse
and
cow
stalls
cleared
away
the
pig
pen
and
laid
a
floor
they
could
dance
on
the
barn
chamber
full
o
their
stuff
so
no
hay
can
go
in
altogether
there
ai
any
nameable
kind
of
a
them
young
varmints
did
play
on
these
premises
when
a
lookin
for
a
home
for
his
family
and
stock
ai
no
use
to
show
him
a
dance
hall
the
only
dancin
a
maine
farmer
ever
does
is
dancin
round
to
git
his
livin
out
o
the
earth
that
keeps
his
feet
flyin
fast
enough
well
said
gilbert
i
think
if
you
can
put
the
rent
cheap
enough
so
that
we
could
make
the
necessary
repairs
i
my
mother
would
consider
it
would
you
want
it
for
more
this
summer
asked
harmon
oh
yes
we
want
to
live
here
to
live
exclaimed
the
astonished
harmon
well
it
been
a
long
time
sence
we
heard
anybody
say
that
eh
colonel
well
now
sonny
gilbert
did
wish
that
respect
for
budding
manhood
could
be
stretched
a
little
further
in
this
locality
i
tell
you
what
i
ai
goin
to
stick
no
fancy
price
on
these
premises
it
would
be
any
use
said
gilbert
boldly
my
father
has
died
within
a
year
there
are
four
of
us
beside
my
mother
and
there
a
cousin
too
who
is
dependent
on
us
we
have
nothing
but
a
small
pension
and
the
interest
on
five
thousand
dollars
life
insurance
mother
says
we
must
go
away
from
all
our
friends
live
cheaply
and
do
our
own
work
until
nancy
kitty
and
i
grow
old
enough
to
earn
something
colonel
wheeler
and
harmon
both
liked
gilbert
carey
at
sight
and
as
he
stood
there
uttering
his
boyish
confidences
with
great
friendliness
and
complete
candor
both
men
would
have
been
glad
to
meet
him
halfway
well
harmon
it
seems
to
me
we
shall
get
some
good
neighbors
if
we
can
make
terms
with
carey
said
the
colonel
if
you
fix
a
reasonable
figure
i
undertake
to
write
to
hamilton
and
interest
him
in
the
affair
all
right
now
colonel
i
like
to
make
a
proposition
right
on
the
spot
before
you
and
you
can
advise
sonny
here
you
see
lem
has
got
his
taxes
to
pay
they
small
of
course
but
they
an
expense
and
he
ought
to
carry
a
little
insurance
on
his
buildings
tho
he
ai
had
any
up
to
now
on
the
other
hand
if
he
can
get
a
tenant
that
put
on
a
few
shingles
and
clapboards
now
and
then
or
a
coat
o
paint
a
roll
o
wall
paper
his
premises
wo
go
to
rack
ruin
same
they
in
danger
o
doin
at
the
present
time
now
sonny
would
your
mother
feel
like
keepin
up
things
a
little
mite
if
we
should
say
sixty
dollars
a
year
rent
payable
monthly
or
quarterly
as
is
convenient
gilbert
head
swam
and
his
eyes
beheld
such
myriads
of
stars
that
he
felt
it
must
be
night
instead
of
day
the
rent
of
the
charlestown
house
was
seven
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
the
last
words
of
his
mother
had
been
to
the
effect
that
two
hundred
was
the
limit
he
must
offer
for
the
yellow
house
as
she
did
not
see
clearly
at
the
moment
how
they
could
afford
even
that
sum
what
would
be
your
advice
colonel
stammered
the
boy
i
think
sixty
dollars
is
not
exorbitant
the
colonel
answered
calmly
he
had
seen
beulah
real
estate
fall
a
peg
a
year
for
twenty
successive
years
though
naturally
you
can
not
pay
that
sum
and
make
any
extravagant
repairs
then
i
will
take
the
house
gilbert
remarked
largely
my
mother
left
the
matter
of
rent
to
my
judgment
and
we
will
pay
promptly
in
advance
shall
i
sign
any
papers
land
o
goshen
the
marks
your
little
fist
would
make
on
a
paper
would
cut
much
of
a
figure
in
a
court
o
law
chuckled
old
harmon
you
jest
let
the
colonel
fix
up
matters
with
your
ma
can
i
walk
back
colonel
asked
gilbert
trying
to
preserve
some
dignity
under
the
storekeeper
attacks
i
like
to
take
some
measurements
and
make
some
sketches
of
the
rooms
for
my
mother
all
right
the
colonel
responded
your
train
does
go
till
two
i
give
you
a
bite
of
lunch
and
take
you
to
the
station
if
mother
carey
had
watched
gilbert
during
the
next
she
would
have
been
gratified
for
every
moment
of
the
time
he
grew
more
and
more
into
the
likeness
of
the
head
of
a
family
he
looked
at
the
cellar
at
the
shed
at
the
closets
and
cupboards
all
over
the
house
and
at
the
fireplaces
he
paced
off
all
the
rooms
and
set
down
their
proportions
in
his
he
even
decided
as
to
who
should
occupy
each
room
and
for
what
purposes
they
should
be
used
his
judgment
in
every
case
being
thought
ridiculous
by
the
feminine
portion
of
his
family
when
they
looked
at
his
plans
then
he
locked
the
doors
carefully
with
a
fine
sense
of
ownership
and
strolled
away
with
many
a
backward
look
and
thought
at
the
yellow
house
at
the
station
he
sent
a
telegram
to
his
mother
nancy
had
secretly
given
him
cents
when
he
left
home
i
am
hoarding
for
the
admiral
christmas
present
she
whispered
but
it
no
use
i
can
not
endure
the
suspense
about
the
house
a
moment
longer
than
is
necessary
just
telegraph
us
yes
or
no
and
we
shall
get
the
news
four
hours
before
your
train
arrives
one
can
die
several
times
in
four
hours
and
going
to
commit
one
last
extravagance
at
the
admiral
expense
at
three
on
saturday
afternoon
a
telegraph
boy
came
through
the
gate
and
rang
the
front
door
bell
you
go
kitty
i
have
the
courage
said
nancy
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
heavily
a
moment
later
the
two
girls
and
peter
who
for
once
did
count
gazed
at
their
mother
breathlessly
as
she
opened
the
envelope
her
face
lighted
as
she
read
aloud
perches
on
my
banners
have
accomplished
all
i
went
gilbert
hurrah
cried
both
girls
the
yellow
house
is
the
house
of
carey
forevermore
will
peter
go
too
asked
the
youngest
carey
eagerly
his
nose
quivering
as
it
always
did
in
excitement
when
it
became
an
animated
question
point
i
should
think
he
would
exclaimed
kitty
clasping
him
in
her
arms
what
would
the
yellow
house
be
without
peter
i
wish
gilbert
would
talk
about
banners
said
nancy
critically
as
she
looked
at
the
telegram
over
her
mother
shoulder
they
not
his
banners
at
all
they
ours
carey
banners
what
they
are
mother
carey
had
wished
the
same
thing
but
hoped
that
nancy
had
not
noticed
the
gilbertian
flaw
in
the
telegram
x
the
careys
flitting
the
charlestown
house
was
now
put
immediately
into
the
hands
of
several
agents
for
carey
lease
had
still
four
years
to
run
and
she
was
naturally
anxious
to
escape
from
this
financial
responsibility
as
soon
as
possible
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
three
days
elapsed
before
she
obtained
a
tenant
and
the
agent
had
easily
secured
an
advance
of
a
hundred
dollars
a
year
to
the
good
as
captain
carey
had
obtained
a
very
favorable
figure
when
he
took
the
house
it
was
the
beginning
of
april
and
letters
from
colonel
wheeler
had
already
asked
instructions
about
having
the
vegetable
garden
ploughed
it
was
finally
decided
that
the
girls
should
leave
their
spring
term
of
school
unfinished
and
that
the
family
should
move
to
beulah
during
gilbert
easter
vacation
mother
carey
gave
due
reflection
to
the
interrupted
studies
but
concluded
that
for
two
girls
like
nancy
and
kathleen
the
making
of
a
new
home
would
be
more
instructive
and
inspiring
and
more
fruitful
in
its
results
than
weeks
of
book
learning
youth
delights
in
change
in
the
prospect
of
new
scenes
and
fresh
adventures
and
as
it
is
never
troubled
by
any
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
its
plans
the
carey
children
were
full
of
vigor
and
energy
just
now
charlestown
the
old
house
the
daily
life
all
had
grown
sad
and
dreary
to
them
since
father
had
gone
everything
spoke
of
him
even
mother
longed
for
something
to
lift
her
thought
out
of
the
past
and
give
it
wings
so
that
it
might
fly
into
the
future
and
find
some
hope
and
comfort
there
there
was
a
continual
bustle
from
morning
till
night
and
a
spirit
of
merriment
that
had
long
been
absent
the
scotch
have
a
much
prettier
word
than
we
for
all
this
and
what
we
term
moving
they
call
flitting
the
word
is
not
only
prettier
but
in
this
instance
more
appropriate
it
was
such
a
buoyant
youthful
affair
this
carey
flitting
light
forms
darted
up
and
down
the
stairs
and
past
the
windows
appearing
now
at
the
back
now
at
the
front
of
the
house
with
a
picture
or
a
postage
stamp
or
a
dish
or
a
penwiper
or
a
pillow
or
a
basket
or
a
spool
the
chorus
of
where
shall
we
put
this
muddy
where
will
this
go
may
we
throw
this
away
would
have
distracted
a
less
patient
parent
when
gilbert
returned
from
school
at
four
the
air
was
filled
with
sounds
of
hammering
and
sawing
and
filing
screwing
and
unscrewing
and
it
was
joy
unspeakable
to
be
obliged
or
at
least
almost
obliged
to
call
in
clarion
tones
to
one
another
across
the
din
and
fanfare
and
to
compel
answers
in
a
high
key
peter
took
a
constant
succession
of
articles
to
the
shed
where
packing
was
going
on
but
his
chief
treasures
were
deposited
in
a
basket
at
the
front
gate
with
the
idea
that
they
would
be
transported
as
his
personal
baggage
the
pile
grew
and
grew
a
woolly
lamb
two
noah
arks
bottles
and
marbles
innumerable
a
bag
of
pebbles
a
broken
steam
engine
two
china
an
orange
a
banana
and
some
walnuts
a
fishing
line
a
trowel
a
ball
of
string
these
give
an
idea
of
the
quality
of
effects
but
not
of
the
quantity
ellen
the
cook
labored
loyally
for
it
was
her
last
week
work
with
the
family
she
would
be
left
behind
like
charlestown
and
all
the
old
life
when
mother
carey
and
the
stormy
petrels
flitted
across
unknown
waters
from
one
haven
to
another
joanna
having
earlier
proved
utterly
unromantic
in
her
attitude
nancy
went
further
with
ellen
and
gave
her
an
english
novel
called
the
merriweathers
in
which
an
old
family
servant
had
not
only
followed
her
employers
from
castle
to
hovel
remaining
there
without
wages
for
years
but
had
insisted
on
lending
all
her
savings
to
the
mistress
of
the
manor
ellen
the
cook
had
loved
the
merriweathers
saying
it
was
about
the
best
book
that
ever
she
had
read
and
miss
nancy
would
like
to
know
always
being
so
interested
that
she
ellen
had
found
a
place
near
joanna
in
salem
where
she
was
offered
five
dollars
a
month
more
than
she
had
received
with
the
careys
nancy
congratulated
her
warmly
and
then
tearing
the
merriweathers
to
shreds
she
put
them
in
the
kitchen
stove
in
ellen
temporary
absence
if
ever
i
write
a
book
she
ejaculated
as
she
stoked
the
fire
with
gwendolen
and
reginald
merriweather
with
the
mistress
of
the
manor
and
especially
with
the
romantic
family
servitor
if
ever
i
write
a
book
she
repeated
with
emphatic
gestures
it
wo
have
any
fibs
in
it
and
i
suppose
it
will
be
dull
she
reflected
as
she
remembered
how
she
had
wept
when
the
merriweathers
bridget
brought
her
savings
of
a
hundred
pounds
to
her
mistress
in
a
handkerchief
during
these
preparations
for
the
flitting
nancy
had
a
fresh
idea
every
minute
or
two
and
gained
immense
prestige
in
the
family
inspired
by
her
eldest
daughter
carey
sold
her
grand
piano
getting
an
square
one
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
exchange
it
had
been
a
wedding
present
from
a
good
old
uncle
who
if
he
had
been
still
alive
would
have
been
glad
to
serve
his
niece
now
that
she
was
in
difficulties
nancy
her
sleeves
rolled
up
her
curly
hair
flecked
with
dust
and
cobwebs
flew
down
from
the
attic
into
kathleen
room
just
after
supper
i
have
an
idea
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
you
must
have
too
many
or
we
sha
take
any
interest
in
them
kitty
answered
provokingly
this
is
for
your
ears
alone
kitty
oh
that
different
tell
me
quickly
it
an
idea
to
get
rid
of
the
curse
of
the
house
of
carey
it
ca
be
done
nancy
you
know
it
ca
even
if
you
could
think
out
a
way
mother
could
be
made
to
agree
she
must
never
know
i
would
not
think
of
mixing
up
a
good
lovely
woman
like
mother
in
such
an
affair
this
was
said
so
mysteriously
that
kathleen
almost
suspected
that
bloodshed
was
included
in
nancy
plan
it
must
be
explained
that
when
young
ensign
carey
and
margaret
gilbert
had
been
married
cousin
ann
chadwick
had
presented
them
with
four
tall
black
and
white
marble
mantel
ornaments
shaped
like
funeral
urns
and
then
feeling
that
she
had
not
yet
shown
her
approval
of
the
match
sufficiently
she
purchased
a
large
group
of
clay
statuary
entitled
you
dirty
boy
the
careys
had
moved
often
like
all
naval
families
but
even
when
their
other
goods
and
chattels
were
stored
cousin
ann
generously
managed
to
defray
the
expense
of
sending
on
to
them
the
mantel
ornaments
and
the
dirty
boy
i
know
what
your
home
is
to
you
she
used
to
say
to
them
and
how
you
must
miss
your
ornaments
if
i
have
chanced
to
give
you
things
as
unwieldy
as
they
are
handsome
i
ought
to
see
that
you
have
them
around
you
without
trouble
or
expense
and
i
will
so
for
sixteen
years
save
for
a
brief
respite
when
the
family
was
in
the
philippines
their
existence
was
blighted
by
these
hated
objects
once
when
they
had
given
an
especially
beautiful
party
for
the
admiral
captain
carey
had
carried
the
whole
lot
to
the
attic
but
cousin
ann
arrived
unexpectedly
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
nancy
with
the
aid
of
gilbert
and
joanna
had
brought
them
down
the
back
way
and
put
them
in
the
dining
room
you
taken
the
ornaments
out
of
the
parlor
i
see
cousin
ann
said
at
the
dinner
table
it
rather
nice
for
a
change
and
after
all
perhaps
you
spend
as
much
time
in
this
room
as
in
any
and
entertain
as
much
company
here
cousin
ann
always
had
been
always
would
be
a
frequent
visitor
for
she
was
devoted
to
the
family
in
her
own
peculiar
way
what
therefore
could
nancy
be
proposing
to
do
with
the
carey
curse
listen
my
good
girl
nancy
now
said
to
kathleen
after
she
had
closed
the
door
thou
dost
know
that
the
comes
early
morn
and
that
now
the
barrels
and
boxes
and
excelsior
are
bestrewing
the
dining
room
yes
then
you
and
i
who
have
been
brought
up
under
the
shadow
of
those
funeral
urns
and
have
seen
that
tidy
mother
scrubbing
the
ears
of
that
unwilling
boy
ever
since
we
were
born
you
and
i
or
thou
and
i
perhaps
i
should
say
will
do
a
little
private
packing
before
the
true
packer
arriveth
still
do
i
not
see
the
point
wench
said
the
puzzled
kathleen
trying
to
model
her
conversation
on
nancy
though
she
was
never
thoroughly
successful
do
call
me
because
i
am
the
mistress
and
you
my
tiring
woman
but
when
you
watch
and
assist
me
at
the
packing
a
great
light
will
break
upon
you
nancy
answered
in
the
removal
of
cherished
articles
from
charlestown
to
beulah
certain
tragedies
will
occur
certain
accidents
will
happen
although
cousin
ann
knows
that
the
carey
family
is
a
well
regulated
one
but
if
there
are
accidents
and
will
my
good
girl
then
the
authors
of
them
will
be
forever
unknown
to
all
but
thou
and
wouldst
prefer
to
pack
this
midnight
or
at
cock
crow
for
packing
is
our
task
i
simply
hate
cock
crow
and
you
know
it
said
kathleen
testily
why
not
now
ellen
and
gilbert
are
out
and
mother
is
rocking
peter
to
sleep
very
well
come
on
and
step
softly
it
wo
take
long
because
i
have
planned
all
in
secret
well
and
thoroughly
do
puff
and
blow
like
that
mother
will
hear
you
i
excited
whispered
kathleen
as
they
stole
down
the
back
stairs
and
went
into
the
parlor
for
the
funeral
urns
which
they
carried
silently
to
the
dining
room
these
safely
deposited
they
took
you
dirty
boy
from
its
abominable
pedestal
of
mexican
onyx
also
cousin
ann
gift
and
staggered
under
its
heavy
weight
their
natural
strength
being
considerably
sapped
by
suppressed
laughter
nancy
chose
an
especially
large
and
stout
barrel
they
put
a
little
very
little
excelsior
in
the
bottom
then
a
pair
of
then
a
funeral
urn
then
a
little
hay
and
another
funeral
urn
crosswise
the
spaces
between
were
carelessly
filled
in
with
indian
clubs
on
these
they
painfully
dropped
you
dirty
boy
and
on
top
of
him
the
other
pair
of
funeral
urns
more
dumbbells
and
another
indian
club
they
had
packed
the
barrel
in
the
corner
where
it
stood
so
they
simply
laid
the
cover
on
top
and
threw
a
piece
of
sacking
carelessly
over
it
the
whole
performance
had
been
punctuated
with
such
hysterical
laughter
from
kathleen
that
she
was
too
weak
to
be
of
any
real
use
she
simply
aided
and
abetted
the
chief
conspirator
the
night
was
not
as
other
nights
the
girls
kept
waking
up
to
laugh
a
little
then
they
went
to
sleep
and
waked
again
and
laughed
again
and
so
on
nancy
composed
several
letters
to
her
cousin
ann
dated
from
beulah
and
explaining
the
sad
accident
that
had
occurred
as
she
concocted
these
documents
between
her
naps
she
could
never
remember
in
her
whole
life
any
such
night
of
mirth
and
minstrelsy
and
not
one
pang
of
conscience
interfered
to
cloud
the
present
joy
nor
dim
that
anticipation
which
is
even
greater
nancy
was
downstairs
early
next
morning
and
managed
to
be
the
one
to
greet
the
we
filled
one
barrel
last
evening
she
explained
to
them
will
you
please
head
that
up
before
you
begin
work
which
one
of
the
men
obligingly
did
we
mark
all
this
stuff
and
take
it
down
to
the
station
this
afternoon
said
the
head
packer
to
carey
be
careful
with
it
wo
you
she
begged
we
are
very
fond
of
our
glass
and
china
our
clocks
and
all
our
little
treasures
you
wo
have
any
breakage
so
long
as
you
deal
with
james
perkins
said
the
packer
nancy
went
back
into
the
room
for
a
moment
to
speak
with
the
skilful
virtuous
there
no
need
to
use
any
care
with
that
corner
barrel
she
said
carelessly
it
has
nothing
of
value
in
it
james
perkins
went
home
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
left
his
son
to
finish
the
work
and
the
son
tagged
and
labelled
and
painted
with
all
his
might
the
dirty
boy
barrel
in
the
corner
being
separated
from
the
others
looked
to
him
especially
important
so
he
gave
particular
attention
to
that
pasted
on
it
one
label
marked
fragile
one
this
side
up
two
glass
with
care
and
finding
several
perishables
in
his
pocket
tied
on
a
few
of
those
and
removed
the
entire
lot
of
boxes
crates
and
barrels
to
the
freight
depot
the
man
who
put
the
articles
in
the
car
was
much
interested
in
the
dirty
boy
barrel
you
ought
to
have
walked
to
greentown
and
carried
that
one
in
your
arms
he
jeered
what
is
the
precious
thing
anyway
do
you
mind
what
it
is
responded
young
perkins
jest
you
keep
everybody
everything
from
teching
it
does
this
lot
o
stuff
have
to
be
shifted
here
and
greentown
no
not
unless
we
git
kind
o
dull
and
turn
it
upside
down
jest
for
fun
i
guess
you
dull
often
by
the
way
things
look
when
you
git
through
carryin
on
this
line
said
perkins
who
had
no
opinion
of
the
freight
department
of
the
b
the
answer
though
not
proper
to
record
in
this
place
was
worthy
of
perkins
opponent
who
had
a
standing
grudge
against
the
entire
race
of
expressmen
and
carters
who
brought
him
boxes
and
barrels
to
handle
it
always
seemed
to
him
that
if
they
were
all
out
of
the
country
or
dead
he
would
have
no
work
to
do
xi
the
service
on
the
threshold
from
this
point
on
the
flitting
went
easily
and
smoothly
enough
and
the
transportation
of
the
carey
family
itself
to
greentown
on
a
mild
budding
day
in
april
was
nothing
compared
to
the
heavy
labor
that
had
preceded
it
all
the
goods
and
chattels
had
been
despatched
a
week
before
so
that
they
would
be
on
the
spot
well
in
advance
and
the
actual
flitting
took
place
on
a
friday
so
that
gilbert
would
have
every
hour
of
his
vacation
to
assist
in
the
settling
process
he
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
visit
a
school
friend
at
easter
saying
to
his
mother
magisterially
i
did
suppose
you
want
me
round
the
house
when
you
were
getting
things
to
rights
men
are
always
in
the
way
so
i
told
fred
bascom
i
go
home
with
him
home
with
fred
our
only
man
sole
prop
of
the
house
of
carey
exclaimed
his
mother
with
consummate
tact
why
gilly
dear
i
shall
want
your
advice
every
hour
and
who
will
know
about
the
planting
for
we
are
only
folks
and
who
will
do
all
the
hammering
and
carpenter
work
you
are
so
wonderful
with
tools
that
you
be
worth
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
oh
well
if
you
need
me
so
much
as
that
i
go
along
of
course
said
gilbert
but
fred
said
his
mother
and
sisters
always
did
this
kind
of
thing
by
themselves
themselves
in
fred
family
remarked
carey
means
a
butler
footman
and
plenty
of
money
for
help
of
every
sort
and
though
no
wonder
you
fond
of
fred
who
is
so
jolly
and
such
good
company
you
must
have
noticed
how
selfish
he
is
now
mother
you
never
seen
fred
bascom
more
than
half
a
dozen
times
no
and
i
do
remember
at
all
what
i
saw
in
him
the
last
five
of
them
for
i
found
out
everything
needful
the
first
time
he
came
to
visit
us
returned
carey
quietly
still
he
a
likable
agreeable
sort
of
boy
and
no
doubt
he
succeed
in
destroying
the
pig
in
him
before
he
grows
up
said
nancy
passing
through
the
room
i
thought
it
gobbled
and
snuffled
a
good
deal
when
we
last
met
colonel
wheeler
was
at
greentown
station
when
the
family
arrived
and
drove
carey
and
peter
to
the
yellow
house
himself
while
the
rest
followed
in
the
depot
carryall
with
a
trail
of
trunks
and
packages
following
on
behind
in
an
express
wagon
it
was
a
very
early
season
the
roads
were
free
from
mud
the
trees
were
budding
and
the
young
grass
showed
green
on
all
the
sunny
slopes
when
the
careys
had
first
seen
their
future
home
they
had
entered
the
village
from
the
west
the
yellow
house
being
the
last
one
on
the
street
and
quite
on
the
outskirts
of
beulah
itself
now
they
crossed
the
river
below
the
station
and
drove
through
east
beulah
over
a
road
unknown
to
any
of
them
but
gilbert
who
was
the
hero
and
instructor
of
the
party
soon
the
house
came
into
view
and
as
the
two
vehicles
had
kept
one
behind
the
other
there
was
a
general
cheer
it
was
more
beautiful
even
than
they
had
remembered
it
and
more
commodious
and
more
delightfully
situated
the
barn
door
was
open
showing
crates
of
furniture
and
the
piazza
was
piled
high
with
boxes
bill
harmon
stood
in
the
front
doorway
smiling
he
hoped
for
trade
and
he
was
a
good
sort
anyway
i
about
given
you
up
he
called
as
he
came
to
the
gate
your
train
half
an
hour
late
i
got
tired
o
waitin
so
i
made
free
to
open
up
some
o
your
things
for
you
to
start
housekeepin
with
i
guess
there
wo
be
no
supper
here
for
you
we
got
it
with
us
said
nancy
joyously
making
acquaintance
in
an
instant
you
forehanded
ai
you
that
right
jump
you
little
pint
o
cider
bill
said
holding
out
his
arms
to
peter
peter
carrying
many
small
things
too
valuable
to
trust
to
others
jumped
as
suggested
and
gave
his
new
friend
an
unexpected
shower
of
bumps
from
hard
substances
concealed
about
his
person
land
o
goshen
you
hai
you
he
inquired
jocosely
as
he
set
peter
down
on
the
ground
the
dazzling
smile
with
which
peter
greeted
this
supposed
tribute
converted
bill
harmon
at
once
into
a
victim
and
slave
little
did
he
know
as
he
carelessly
stood
there
at
the
wagon
wheel
that
he
was
destined
to
bestow
upon
that
small
boy
offerings
from
his
stock
for
years
to
come
he
and
colonel
wheeler
were
speedily
lifting
things
from
the
carryall
while
the
careys
walked
up
the
pathway
together
thrilling
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
nancy
breathed
hard
flushed
and
caught
her
mother
hand
o
motherdy
she
said
under
her
breath
it
all
happening
just
as
we
dreamed
it
and
now
that
it
really
here
it
like
it
like
a
dedication
somehow
gilbert
do
dear
let
mother
step
over
the
sill
first
and
call
us
into
the
yellow
house
i
lock
the
door
again
and
give
the
key
to
her
mother
carey
her
heart
in
her
throat
felt
anew
the
solemn
nature
of
the
undertaking
it
broke
over
her
in
waves
fresher
stronger
now
that
the
actual
moment
had
arrived
than
it
ever
had
done
in
prospect
she
took
the
last
step
upward
and
standing
in
the
doorway
trembling
said
softly
as
she
turned
the
key
come
home
children
nancy
gilbert
kathleen
they
flocked
in
all
their
laughter
hushed
by
the
new
tone
in
her
voice
nancy
and
kitty
arms
encircled
their
waist
gilbert
with
sudden
instinct
took
off
his
hat
and
peter
looking
at
his
elder
brother
wonderingly
did
the
same
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
the
kind
of
golden
silence
that
is
full
to
the
brim
of
thoughts
and
prayers
and
memories
and
hopes
and
desires
so
full
of
all
these
and
other
beautiful
quiet
things
that
it
makes
speech
seem
poor
and
shabby
then
mother
carey
turned
and
the
yellow
house
was
blessed
colonel
wheeler
and
bill
harmon
at
the
gate
never
even
suspected
that
there
had
been
a
little
service
on
the
threshold
when
they
came
up
the
pathway
to
see
if
there
was
anything
more
needed
i
set
up
all
the
bedsteads
and
got
the
mattresses
on
said
bill
harmon
thinkin
the
sandman
would
come
early
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
kind
and
neighborly
cried
carey
gratefully
i
thought
we
should
have
to
go
somewhere
else
to
sleep
is
it
you
who
keeps
the
village
store
that
me
said
bill
well
if
you
be
good
enough
to
come
back
once
more
with
a
little
of
everything
we
be
very
much
obliged
we
have
an
oil
stove
tea
and
coffee
tinned
meats
bread
and
fruit
what
we
need
most
is
butter
eggs
milk
and
flour
gilbert
open
the
box
of
eatables
please
and
nancy
unlock
the
trunk
that
has
the
bed
linen
in
it
we
little
thought
we
should
find
such
friends
here
did
we
i
got
your
extension
table
into
the
said
bill
and
tried
my
best
to
find
your
dishes
but
i
did
make
out
up
to
the
time
you
got
here
mebbe
you
marked
someway
you
know
which
to
unpack
first
i
was
only
findin
things
that
wa
no
present
use
as
i
guess
you
say
when
you
see
on
the
dining
table
they
all
followed
him
as
he
threw
open
the
door
nancy
well
in
the
front
as
i
fear
was
generally
the
case
there
on
the
centre
of
the
table
stood
you
dirty
boy
rearing
his
crested
head
in
triumph
and
round
him
like
the
gate
posts
of
a
mausoleum
stood
the
four
black
and
white
marble
funeral
urns
perfect
and
entire
without
a
flaw
they
stood
there
confronting
nancy
it
is
like
them
to
be
the
first
to
greet
us
exclaimed
carey
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
but
there
was
not
a
sound
from
kathleen
or
nancy
they
stood
rooted
to
the
floor
gazing
at
the
curse
of
the
house
of
carey
as
if
their
eyes
must
deceive
them
you
look
as
though
you
did
expect
to
see
them
girls
said
their
mother
but
when
did
they
ever
fail
us
do
you
know
i
have
a
courage
at
this
moment
that
i
never
felt
before
beulah
is
so
far
from
buffalo
that
cousin
ann
can
not
visit
us
often
and
never
without
warning
i
should
not
like
to
offend
her
or
hurt
her
feelings
but
i
think
keep
you
dirty
boy
and
the
mantel
ornaments
in
the
attic
for
the
present
or
the
barn
chamber
what
do
you
say
colonel
wheeler
and
harmon
had
departed
so
a
shout
of
agreement
went
up
from
the
young
careys
nancy
approached
you
dirty
boy
with
a
bloodthirsty
glare
in
her
eye
come
along
you
evil
uncanny
thing
she
said
take
hold
of
his
other
end
gilly
and
start
for
the
barn
that
farthest
away
but
it
no
use
he
just
like
that
bloodstain
on
lady
macbeth
hand
he
will
not
out
kathleen
open
the
linen
trunk
while
we
gone
we
ca
set
the
table
till
these
curses
are
removed
when
you
got
the
linen
out
take
a
marble
urn
in
each
hand
and
trail
them
along
to
where
we
are
you
can
track
us
by
a
line
of
my
tears
they
found
the
stairs
to
the
barn
chamber
and
lifted
you
dirty
boy
up
step
by
step
with
slow
painful
effort
kathleen
ran
out
and
put
two
vases
on
the
lowest
step
and
ran
back
to
the
house
for
the
other
pair
gilbert
and
nancy
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
with
you
dirty
boy
between
them
settling
where
he
could
be
easiest
reached
if
he
had
to
be
brought
down
for
any
occasion
an
unwelcome
occasion
that
was
certain
to
occur
sometime
in
the
coming
years
suddenly
they
heard
their
names
called
in
a
tragic
whisper
nancy
quick
cousin
ann
at
the
front
there
was
a
crash
no
human
being
however
could
have
withstood
the
shock
of
that
surprise
coming
as
it
did
so
swiftly
so
unexpectedly
and
with
such
awful
inappropriateness
gilbert
and
nancy
let
go
of
you
dirty
boy
simultaneously
and
he
fell
to
the
floor
in
two
large
fragments
the
break
occurring
so
happily
that
the
mother
and
the
washcloth
were
on
one
half
and
the
boy
on
the
other
a
situation
long
desired
by
the
boy
to
whom
the
parting
was
most
welcome
she
got
off
at
the
wrong
station
panted
kathleen
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
had
to
be
driven
five
miles
or
she
would
have
got
here
as
she
planned
an
hour
before
we
did
she
come
to
help
us
settle
and
says
she
was
afraid
mother
would
overdo
did
you
drop
anything
hurry
down
and
i
leave
the
vases
here
in
among
the
furniture
or
shall
i
take
back
two
of
them
to
show
that
they
were
our
first
thought
and
oh
i
forgot
she
brought
julia
two
more
to
feed
and
not
enough
beds
nancy
and
gilbert
confronted
each
other
hide
the
body
in
the
corner
gilly
said
nancy
and
say
gilly
yes
what
you
see
he
in
two
pieces
yes
do
you
say
to
making
him
four
or
i
say
you
go
downstairs
ahead
of
me
and
into
the
house
and
i
follow
you
a
moment
later
close
the
barn
door
carefully
behind
you
am
i
understood
you
are
gilly
understood
and
gloried
in
and
reverenced
my
spirit
will
be
with
you
when
you
do
it
gilly
dear
though
i
myself
will
be
greeting
cousin
ann
and
julia
xii
cousin
ann
mother
carey
not
wishing
to
make
any
larger
number
of
persons
uncomfortable
than
necessary
had
asked
julia
not
to
come
to
them
until
after
the
house
in
beulah
had
been
put
to
rights
but
the
fergusons
went
abroad
rather
unexpectedly
and
ferguson
tore
julia
from
the
arms
of
gladys
and
put
her
on
the
train
with
very
little
formality
her
meeting
cousin
ann
on
the
way
was
merely
one
of
those
unpleasant
coincidences
with
which
life
is
filled
although
it
is
hardly
possible
usually
for
two
such
disagreeable
persons
to
be
on
the
same
small
spot
at
the
same
precise
moment
on
the
third
morning
after
the
careys
arrival
however
matters
assumed
a
more
hopeful
attitude
for
cousin
ann
became
discontented
with
beulah
the
weather
had
turned
cold
and
the
fireplaces
so
long
unused
were
uniformly
smoky
cousin
ann
stomach
always
delicate
turned
from
tinned
meats
eggs
three
times
a
day
and
soda
biscuits
made
by
bill
harmon
wife
likewise
did
it
turn
from
nuts
apples
oranges
and
bananas
on
which
the
children
thrived
so
she
went
to
the
hotel
for
her
meals
her
remarks
to
the
landlady
after
two
dinners
and
one
supper
were
of
a
character
not
to
be
endured
by
any
outspoken
new
england
woman
i
keep
a
hotel
and
i
give
you
your
meals
for
cents
apiece
so
long
as
you
eat
what
set
before
you
and
hold
your
tongue
was
the
irate
buck
ultimatum
i
feed
you
she
continued
passionately
because
it
my
business
to
put
up
and
take
in
anything
that
respectable
but
i
wo
take
none
o
your
sass
well
cousin
ann
temper
was
up
too
by
this
time
and
she
declined
on
her
part
to
take
any
of
the
landlady
sass
so
they
parted
rather
to
carey
embarrassment
as
she
did
not
wish
to
make
enemies
at
the
outset
that
night
cousin
ann
still
smarting
under
the
memory
of
buck
snapping
eyes
high
color
and
unbridled
tongue
complained
after
supper
that
her
bedstead
rocked
whenever
she
moved
and
asked
gilbert
if
he
could
readjust
it
in
some
way
so
that
it
should
be
as
stationary
as
beds
usually
are
in
a
normal
state
he
took
his
tool
basket
and
went
upstairs
obediently
spending
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
with
the
article
of
furniture
which
he
suspected
of
rocking
merely
because
it
could
bear
cousin
ann
this
idea
so
delighted
nancy
that
she
was
obliged
to
retire
from
proximity
lest
the
family
should
observe
her
mirth
and
gilbert
and
impute
undue
importance
to
it
i
done
everything
to
the
bedstead
i
can
think
of
gilbert
said
on
coming
downstairs
you
can
see
how
it
works
cousin
ann
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
work
instead
of
remaining
in
perfect
quiet
as
a
bedstead
should
when
the
family
was
sound
asleep
at
midnight
a
loud
crash
was
heard
and
cousin
ann
throwing
open
the
door
of
her
room
speedily
informed
everybody
in
the
house
that
her
bed
had
come
down
with
her
giving
her
nerves
a
shock
from
which
they
probably
would
never
recover
gilbert
is
far
too
young
for
the
responsibilities
you
put
upon
him
margaret
cousin
ann
exclaimed
drawing
her
wrapper
more
closely
over
her
tall
spare
figure
and
if
he
was
as
old
as
methuselah
he
would
still
be
careless
for
he
was
born
so
all
this
talk
about
his
being
skilful
with
tools
has
only
swollen
his
vanity
a
boy
of
his
age
should
be
able
to
make
a
bedstead
stay
together
the
whole
family
including
the
crestfallen
gilbert
proposed
various
plans
of
relief
all
except
nancy
who
did
not
wish
to
meet
glance
for
fear
that
she
should
have
to
suspect
him
of
a
new
crime
having
embarked
on
a
career
of
villainy
under
her
direct
instigation
he
might
go
on
of
his
own
accord
indefinitely
she
did
not
believe
him
guilty
but
she
preferred
not
to
look
into
the
matter
more
closely
mother
carey
eyes
searched
gilbert
but
found
there
no
confirmation
of
her
fears
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
mother
said
the
boy
i
would
be
so
mean
as
to
rig
up
an
accident
for
cousin
ann
though
i
like
her
to
have
a
little
one
every
night
just
for
the
fun
of
it
cousin
ann
refused
to
let
gilbert
try
again
on
the
bedstead
and
refused
part
of
carey
bed
preferring
to
sleep
on
two
hair
mattresses
laid
on
her
bedroom
floor
they
may
not
be
comfortable
she
said
tersely
but
at
least
they
will
not
endanger
my
life
the
next
morning
post
brought
business
letters
and
cousin
ann
feared
she
would
have
to
leave
beulah
although
there
was
work
for
a
fortnight
to
come
right
there
and
margaret
had
not
strength
enough
to
get
through
it
alone
she
thought
the
chimneys
were
full
of
soot
and
did
believe
the
kitchen
stove
would
ever
draw
she
was
sure
that
there
were
dead
toads
and
frogs
in
the
well
the
house
was
inconvenient
and
always
would
be
till
water
was
brought
into
the
kitchen
sink
julia
seemed
to
have
no
leaning
towards
housework
and
had
an
appetite
that
she
could
only
describe
as
a
crime
inasmuch
as
the
wherewithal
to
satisfy
it
had
to
be
purchased
by
others
the
climate
was
damp
because
of
the
river
and
there
was
no
proper
market
within
eight
miles
kathleen
was
too
delicate
to
live
in
such
a
place
and
the
move
from
charlestown
was
an
utter
and
absolute
and
entire
mistake
from
a
to
z
then
she
packed
her
small
trunk
and
gilbert
ran
to
the
village
on
glad
and
winged
feet
to
get
some
one
to
take
his
depressing
relative
to
the
noon
train
to
boston
as
for
nancy
she
stood
in
front
of
the
parlor
fireplace
and
when
she
heard
the
hoot
of
the
engine
in
the
distance
she
removed
the
four
mortuary
vases
from
the
mantelpiece
and
took
them
to
the
attic
while
gilbert
from
the
upper
hall
was
chanting
a
favorite
old
rhyme
she
called
us
names
till
she
was
tired
she
called
us
names
till
we
perspired
she
called
us
names
we
never
could
spell
she
called
us
names
we
never
may
tell
she
called
us
names
that
made
us
laugh
she
called
us
names
for
a
day
and
a
half
she
called
us
names
till
her
memory
failed
but
finally
out
of
our
sight
she
sailed
it
must
have
been
written
about
cousin
ann
in
the
first
place
said
nancy
joining
kathleen
in
the
kitchen
well
she
gone
at
last
now
every
prospect
pleases
and
only
julia
vile
she
paraphrased
from
the
old
hymn
into
kathleen
private
ear
you
ought
to
say
such
things
nancy
rebuked
kathleen
mother
would
like
it
i
know
it
confessed
nancy
remorsefully
i
have
been
wicked
since
the
moment
i
tried
to
get
rid
of
you
dirty
boy
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
my
blood
seems
to
be
too
red
and
it
courses
wildly
through
my
veins
as
the
books
say
i
am
going
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
now
that
cousin
ann
gone
and
our
only
cross
is
julia
oh
but
it
is
rather
dreadful
to
think
how
one
person
can
spoil
the
world
if
only
you
could
have
seen
the
yellow
house
after
cousin
ann
went
if
only
you
could
have
heard
the
hotel
landlady
exclaim
as
she
drove
past
well
good
riddance
to
bad
rubbish
the
weather
grew
warmer
outside
almost
at
once
and
bill
harmon
son
planted
the
garden
the
fireplaces
ceased
to
smoke
and
the
kitchen
stove
drew
colonel
wheeler
suggested
a
new
chain
pump
instead
of
the
old
wooden
one
after
which
the
water
took
a
turn
for
the
better
and
before
the
month
was
ended
the
yellow
house
began
to
look
like
home
notwithstanding
julia
as
for
beulah
village
after
its
sleep
of
months
under
deep
it
had
waked
into
the
adorable
beauty
of
an
early
new
england
summer
it
had
no
mountains
in
the
distance
no
amethyst
foothills
to
enchain
the
eye
no
wonderful
canyons
and
splendid
rocky
passes
to
make
the
tourist
marvel
no
length
of
yellow
sea
sands
nor
plash
of
ocean
surf
no
trade
no
amusements
no
summer
visitors
it
was
just
a
quiet
little
sunny
verdant
leafy
piece
of
heart
content
that
what
beulah
was
and
julia
could
spoil
it
indeed
the
odds
were
that
it
would
sweeten
julia
that
was
what
mother
carey
hoped
when
her
heart
had
an
hour
leisure
to
drift
beyond
shiny
wall
into
peacepool
and
consider
the
needs
of
her
five
children
it
was
generally
at
twilight
when
she
was
getting
peter
to
sleep
that
she
was
busiest
making
old
beasts
into
new
people
fancy
that
i
make
things
my
little
dear
says
mother
carey
to
tom
the
water
baby
but
i
sit
here
and
make
them
make
themselves
there
was
once
a
fairy
so
the
tale
goes
who
was
so
clever
that
she
found
out
how
to
make
butterflies
and
she
was
so
proud
that
she
flew
straight
off
to
peacepool
to
boast
to
mother
carey
of
her
skill
but
mother
carey
laughed
know
silly
child
she
said
that
any
one
can
make
things
if
he
will
take
time
and
trouble
enough
but
it
is
not
every
one
who
can
make
things
make
themselves
make
things
make
themselves
mother
carey
used
to
think
in
the
twilight
i
suppose
that
is
what
mothers
are
for
nancy
was
making
herself
busily
these
days
and
the
offending
julia
was
directly
responsible
for
such
and
gains
in
general
virtue
as
poor
impetuous
nancy
achieved
kathleen
was
growing
stronger
and
steadier
and
less
gilbert
was
doing
better
at
school
and
his
letters
showed
more
consideration
and
thought
for
the
family
than
they
had
done
heretofore
even
the
was
a
little
sweeter
and
more
just
now
thought
mother
carey
fondly
as
she
rocked
him
to
sleep
he
was
worn
out
with
following
natty
harmon
at
the
plough
and
succumbed
quickly
to
the
music
of
her
song
and
the
comfort
of
her
sheltering
arms
mother
carey
had
arms
to
carry
arms
to
enfold
arms
to
comfort
and
caress
she
also
had
a
fine
handsome
strong
hand
admirable
for
spanking
but
she
had
so
many
invisible
methods
of
discipline
at
her
command
that
she
never
needed
a
visible
spanker
for
peter
spanking
is
all
very
well
in
its
poor
way
she
used
to
say
but
a
woman
who
has
to
fall
back
on
it
very
often
is
sadly
lacking
in
ingenuity
as
she
lifted
peter
into
his
crib
nancy
came
softly
in
at
the
door
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
her
hand
she
drew
her
mother
out
to
the
window
over
the
front
door
listen
she
said
do
you
hear
the
frogs
i
been
listening
to
them
for
the
last
her
mother
said
is
everything
sweet
with
the
soft
air
and
the
elms
all
feathered
out
and
the
new
moon
was
it
ever
so
green
before
nancy
wondered
leaning
over
the
by
her
mother
side
were
the
trees
ever
so
was
any
river
ever
so
clear
or
any
moon
so
yellow
i
am
so
sorry
for
the
city
people
tonight
sometimes
i
think
it
ca
be
so
beautiful
here
as
it
looks
mother
sometimes
i
wonder
if
part
of
the
beauty
is
inside
of
us
said
nancy
part
of
all
beauty
is
in
the
eyes
that
look
at
it
her
mother
answered
and
i
been
reading
harmon
new
reference
bible
nancy
continued
and
here
is
what
it
says
about
beulah
she
held
the
paper
to
the
waning
light
and
read
shalt
no
more
be
termed
forsaken
neither
shall
thy
land
any
more
be
termed
desolate
but
it
shall
be
called
beulah
for
the
lord
delighteth
in
i
think
father
would
be
comforted
if
he
could
see
us
all
in
the
yellow
house
at
beulah
nancy
went
on
softly
as
the
two
leaned
out
of
the
window
together
he
was
so
loving
so
careful
of
us
so
afraid
that
anything
should
trouble
us
that
for
months
i
could
think
of
him
even
in
heaven
as
anything
but
worried
but
now
it
seems
just
as
if
we
were
over
the
hardest
time
and
could
learn
to
live
here
in
beulah
and
so
he
must
be
comforted
if
he
can
see
us
or
think
about
us
at
all
do
you
feel
like
that
mother
yes
her
mother
agreed
gently
and
her
heart
was
grateful
and
full
of
hope
she
had
lost
the
father
of
her
children
and
the
dear
companion
of
her
life
and
that
loss
could
never
be
made
good
still
her
mind
acknowledged
the
riches
she
possessed
in
her
children
so
she
confessed
herself
neither
desolate
nor
forsaken
but
something
in
a
humble
human
way
that
the
lord
could
take
delight
in
xiii
the
pink
of
perfection
that
was
the
only
trouble
with
allan
carey
little
daughter
julia
aged
thirteen
she
was
and
always
had
been
the
pink
of
perfection
as
a
baby
she
had
always
been
exemplary
eating
heartily
and
sleeping
soundly
when
she
felt
a
pin
in
her
flannel
petticoat
she
deemed
it
discourteous
to
cry
because
she
knew
that
her
nurse
had
at
least
tried
to
dress
her
properly
when
awake
her
mental
machinery
moved
slowly
and
without
any
jerks
as
to
her
moral
machinery
the
angels
must
have
set
it
going
at
birth
and
planned
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
neither
stop
nor
go
wrong
it
was
well
meant
of
course
but
probably
the
angels
who
had
the
matter
in
charge
were
new
young
inexperienced
angels
with
vague
ideas
of
human
nature
and
inexact
knowledge
of
god
intentions
because
a
child
that
has
no
capability
of
doing
the
wrong
thing
will
hardly
be
able
to
manage
a
right
one
not
one
of
the
big
sort
anyway
at
four
or
five
years
old
julia
was
always
spoken
of
as
such
a
good
little
girl
many
a
time
had
nancy
in
early
youth
stamped
her
foot
and
cried
do
talk
about
julia
i
will
not
hear
about
julia
for
she
was
always
held
up
as
a
pattern
of
excellence
truth
to
tell
she
bored
her
own
mother
terribly
but
that
is
not
strange
for
by
a
curious
freak
of
nature
allan
carey
was
as
flighty
and
capricious
and
irresponsible
and
gay
and
naughty
as
julia
was
steady
limited
narrow
conventional
and
dull
but
the
flighty
mother
passed
out
of
the
carey
family
life
and
julia
from
the
age
of
five
onward
fell
into
the
charge
of
a
pious
unimaginative
governess
instead
of
being
turned
out
to
pasture
with
a
lot
of
frolicsome
young
human
creatures
so
at
thirteen
she
had
apparently
settled
hard
solid
and
firm
into
a
mould
she
had
smooth
fair
hair
pale
blue
eyes
thin
lips
and
a
somewhat
too
plump
shape
for
her
years
she
was
always
tidy
and
wore
her
clothes
well
laying
enormous
stress
upon
their
material
and
style
this
trait
in
her
character
having
been
added
under
the
fostering
influence
of
the
wealthy
and
fashionable
gladys
ferguson
at
thirteen
when
julia
joined
the
flock
of
carey
chickens
she
had
the
air
of
belonging
to
quite
another
order
of
beings
they
had
been
through
a
discipline
seldom
suffered
by
only
children
they
had
had
to
divide
apples
and
toys
take
turns
at
reading
books
and
learn
generally
to
trot
in
double
harness
if
nancy
had
a
new
dress
at
christmas
kathleen
had
a
new
hat
in
the
spring
gilbert
heard
the
cry
of
low
bridge
very
often
after
kathleen
appeared
on
the
scene
and
kathleen
ears
too
grew
well
accustomed
to
the
same
phrase
after
peter
was
born
julia
never
did
a
naughty
thing
in
her
life
nor
spoke
a
wrong
word
said
her
father
once
proudly
never
mind
she
only
ten
and
there
hope
for
her
yet
captain
carey
had
replied
cheerfully
though
if
he
had
known
her
a
little
later
in
her
first
beulah
days
he
might
not
have
been
so
sanguine
she
seemed
to
have
no
instinct
of
adapting
herself
to
the
family
life
standing
just
a
little
aloof
and
in
an
attitude
of
silent
criticism
she
was
a
trig
smug
prig
nancy
said
delighting
in
her
accidental
muster
of
three
short
hard
descriptive
words
she
had
a
bit
of
humor
no
fun
no
gayety
no
generous
enthusiasms
that
carried
her
too
far
for
safety
or
propriety
she
brought
with
her
to
beulah
sheaves
of
school
certificates
and
when
she
showed
them
to
gilbert
with
their
hundred
per
cent
deportment
and
and
per
cent
scholarship
every
month
for
years
he
went
out
behind
the
barn
and
kicked
its
foundations
savagely
for
several
minutes
she
was
a
sort
of
continual
sunday
child
with
an
air
of
church
and
cold
dinner
and
and
and
early
bed
nobody
could
fear
as
for
some
impulsive
reckless
little
creature
that
she
would
come
to
a
bad
end
nancy
said
no
one
could
imagine
her
as
coming
to
anything
not
even
an
end
you
never
let
mother
hear
you
say
these
things
nancy
kathleen
remarked
once
but
really
and
truly
it
just
as
bad
to
say
them
at
all
when
you
know
she
would
approve
my
present
object
is
to
be
as
good
as
gold
in
mother
eyes
but
there
i
stop
retorted
nancy
cheerfully
pretty
soon
i
shall
get
virtuous
enough
to
go
a
step
further
and
endeavor
to
please
the
angels
not
julia
angels
but
the
other
angels
who
understand
and
are
patient
because
they
remember
our
frames
and
know
that
being
dust
we
are
likely
to
be
dusty
once
in
a
while
julia
was
made
of
dust
she
was
made
of
let
me
see
of
skim
milk
and
baked
custard
the
watery
kind
and
rice
flour
and
gelatine
with
a
very
little
piece
of
overripe
banana
not
enough
to
flavor
just
enough
to
sicken
stir
this
up
with
weak
barley
water
without
putting
in
a
trace
of
salt
sugar
spice
or
pepper
set
it
in
a
cool
oven
take
it
out
before
it
is
done
and
you
will
get
julia
nancy
was
triumphant
over
this
recipe
for
making
julias
only
regretting
that
she
could
never
show
it
to
her
mother
who
if
critical
was
always
most
appreciative
she
did
send
it
in
a
letter
to
the
admiral
off
in
china
and
he
being
none
too
good
for
human
nature
daily
food
enjoyed
it
hugely
and
never
scolded
her
at
all
julia
only
conversation
at
this
time
was
on
matters
concerning
gladys
ferguson
and
the
ferguson
family
when
you
are
washing
dishes
in
the
sink
of
the
yellow
house
in
beulah
it
is
very
irritating
to
hear
of
gladys
ferguson
opera
glasses
her
french
maid
her
breakfast
on
a
tray
in
bed
her
diamond
ring
her
photograph
in
the
sunday
times
her
travels
abroad
her
proficiency
in
french
and
german
do
trot
gladys
into
the
kitchen
for
goodness
sake
julia
grumbled
nancy
on
a
warm
day
i
do
want
her
diamond
ring
in
my
dishwater
wait
till
sunday
when
we
go
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
in
our
best
clothes
if
you
must
talk
about
her
you
do
wipe
the
tumblers
dry
nor
put
them
in
the
proper
place
when
your
mind
is
full
of
gladys
all
right
said
julia
gently
only
i
hope
i
shall
always
be
able
to
wipe
dishes
and
keep
my
mind
on
better
things
at
the
same
time
what
miss
tewksbury
told
me
when
she
knew
i
had
got
to
give
up
my
home
luxuries
for
a
long
time
let
poverty
drag
you
down
julia
she
said
your
high
thoughts
and
do
let
them
get
soiled
with
the
grime
of
daily
living
it
is
only
just
to
say
that
nancy
was
not
absolutely
destitute
of
and
politeness
because
at
this
moment
she
had
a
really
vicious
desire
to
wash
julia
supercilious
face
and
neat
nose
with
the
dishcloth
fresh
from
the
frying
pan
she
knew
that
she
could
not
grasp
those
irritating
high
thoughts
and
apply
the
grime
of
daily
living
to
them
concretely
and
actually
but
julia
face
was
within
her
reach
and
nancy
fingers
tingled
with
desire
no
trace
of
this
savage
impulse
appeared
in
her
behavior
however
she
rinsed
the
dishpan
turned
it
upside
down
in
the
sink
and
gave
the
wiping
towels
to
julia
asking
her
to
wring
them
out
in
hot
water
and
hang
them
on
the
barberry
bushes
according
to
carey
instructions
it
does
seem
as
if
i
could
whimpered
julia
i
have
always
been
so
sensitive
and
dish
towels
are
so
disgusting
they
do
nancy
they
do
said
nancy
sternly
but
they
will
smell
worse
if
they
are
not
washed
i
give
you
the
and
take
the
washing
just
to
save
your
hands
but
you
must
turn
and
turn
about
with
kathleen
and
me
with
some
of
the
ugly
hateful
things
if
you
were
company
of
course
we
could
let
you
but
you
are
a
member
of
the
family
our
principal
concern
must
be
to
keep
mother
thoughts
from
grime
ours
must
just
take
their
chance
oh
how
julia
disliked
nancy
at
this
epoch
in
their
common
history
and
how
cordially
and
vigorously
the
dislike
was
returned
many
an
unhappy
moment
did
mother
carey
have
over
the
feud
mostly
deep
and
silent
that
went
on
between
these
two
and
gilbert
attitude
was
not
much
more
hopeful
he
had
found
a
timetable
or
syllabus
for
the
day
doings
over
julia
washstand
it
had
been
framed
under
miss
tewksbury
guidance
who
knew
julia
unpunctuality
and
lack
of
system

there
was
nothing

about
this
indeed
it
was
excellently
conceived
still
it
appeared
to
gilbert
as
excessively
funny
and
with
nancy
help
he
wrote
another
syllabus
and
tacked
it
over

on
waking
i

carey
had
a
sense
of
humor
and
when
the
weeping
julia
brought
the
two
documents
to
her
for
consideration
she
had
great
difficulty
in
adjusting
the
matter
gravely
and
with
due
sympathy
for
her
niece
the
never
mentioned
my
appetite
julia
wailed
they
were
always
trying
to
me
to
eat
gilbert
and
nancy
are
a
little
too
fond
of
fun
and
a
little
too
prone
to
chaffing
said
carey
they
forget
that
you
are
not
used
to
it
but
i
will
try
to
make
them
more
considerate
and
do
forget
my
dear
that
in
a
large
family
like
ours
we
must
learn
to
and
let
live
xiv
ways
and
means
it
was
late
june
and
gilbert
had
returned
from
school
so
the
work
of
making
the
yellow
house
attractive
and
convenient
was
to
move
forward
at
once
up
to
now
the
unpacking
and
distribution
of
the
furniture
with
the
daily
housework
and
cooking
had
been
all
that
carey
and
the
girls
could
manage
a
village
ossian
popham
generally
and
familiarly
called
osh
popham
had
been
called
in
to
whitewash
existing
closets
and
put
hooks
in
them
also
with
bill
harmon
consent
to
make
new
ones
here
and
there
in
handy
corners
dozens
of
shelves
in
odd
spaces
helped
much
in
the
tidy
stowing
away
of
household
articles
and
stores
in
the
midst
of
this
delightful
and
cheery
a
letter
arrived
from
cousin
ann
the
family
was
all
sitting
together
in
carey
room
the
announced
intention
being
to
hold
an
important
meeting
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
the
careys
being
strong
on
ways
and
uniformly
short
on
means
the
arrival
of
the
letters
by
the
hand
of
bill
harmon
boy
occurred
before
the
meeting
was
called
to
order
may
i
read
cousin
ann
aloud
asked
nancy
who
had
her
private
reasons
for
making
the
offer
certainly
said
carey
unsuspectingly
as
she
took
up
the
inevitable
stocking
i
almost
wish
you
had
all
been
storks
instead
of
chickens
then
you
would
always
have
held
up
one
foot
and
perhaps
that
stocking
at
least
would
have
had
holes
in
it
poor
muddy
i
learning
to
darn
cried
kathleen
kissing
her
longhampton
new
jersey
my
dear
margaret
so
nancy
read
the
climate
of
this
seaside
place
suits
me
so
badly
that
i
have
concluded
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
summer
with
you
lightening
those
household
tasks
which
will
fall
so
heavily
on
your
shoulders
groans
from
the
whole
family
greeted
this
opening
passage
and
gilbert
cast
himself
face
down
on
his
mother
lounge
it
is
always
foggy
here
when
it
does
not
rain
and
the
cooking
is
very
bad
the
manager
of
the
hotel
is
uncivil
and
the
office
clerks
very
rude
so
that
beulah
unfortunate
place
of
residence
as
i
consider
it
will
be
much
preferable
i
hope
you
are
getting
on
well
with
the
work
on
the
house
although
i
regard
your
treating
it
as
if
it
were
your
own
as
the
height
of
extravagance
you
will
never
get
back
a
penny
you
spend
on
it
and
probably
when
you
get
it
in
good
order
hamilton
will
come
back
from
europe
and
live
in
it
himself
or
take
it
away
from
you
and
sell
it
to
some
one
else
gilbert
will
be
home
by
now
but
i
should
not
allow
him
to
touch
the
woodwork
as
he
is
too
careless
and
unreliable
she
never
forget
that
the
bed
came
down
with
her
exclaimed
gilbert
his
voice
muffled
by
the
sofa
cushions
remember
me
to
julia
i
hope
she
enjoys
her
food
better
than
when
i
was
with
you
children
must
eat
if
they
would
grow
mother
carey
pricked
up
her
ears
at
this
point
and
gilbert
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
but
nancy
went
on
gravely
tell
kathleen
to
keep
out
of
the
sun
or
wear
a
hat
as
her
complexion
is
not
at
all
what
it
used
to
be
without
color
and
with
freckles
she
will
be
an
unusually
plain
child
kathleen
flushed
angrily
and
laid
down
her
work
give
my
love
to
darling
nancy
what
a
treasure
you
have
in
your
eldest
margaret
i
hope
you
are
properly
grateful
for
her
such
talent
such
beauty
such
grace
such
discretion
but
here
the
family
rose
and
descended
on
the
reader
of
the
spurious
letter
just
as
she
had
turned
the
first
page
in
the
amiable
scuffle
that
ensued
a
blue
slip
fell
from
cousin
ann
envelope
and
gilbert
handed
it
to
his
mother
with
the
letter
carey
wiping
the
tears
of
merriment
that
came
to
her
eyes
in
spite
of
her
so
exactly
had
nancy
caught
cousin
ann
epistolary
style
read
the
real
communication
which
ran
as
follows
dear
margaret
i
have
had
you
much
in
mind
since
i
left
you
always
with
great
anxiety
lest
your
strength
should
fail
under
the
unexpected
strain
you
put
upon
it
i
had
intended
to
give
each
of
you
a
check
for
dollars
at
christmas
to
spend
as
you
liked
but
i
must
say
i
have
not
entire
confidence
in
your
judgment
you
will
be
likelier
far
to
decorate
the
walls
of
the
house
than
to
bring
water
into
the
kitchen
sink
i
therefore
enclose
you
three
hundred
dollars
and
beg
that
you
will
have
the
well
piped
and
if
there
is
any
way
to
carry
the
water
to
the
bedroom
floor
do
it
and
let
me
send
the
extra
amount
involved
you
will
naturally
have
the
well
cleaned
out
anyway
but
i
should
prefer
never
to
know
what
you
found
in
it
my
only
other
large
gift
to
you
in
the
past
was
one
of
ornaments
sent
you
remember
at
the
time
of
your
wedding
we
remember
groaned
the
children
in
chorus
i
do
not
regret
this
though
my
view
of
life
of
its
sorrows
and
perplexities
has
changed
somewhat
and
i
am
more
practical
than
i
used
to
be
the
general
opinion
is
that
in
giving
for
a
present
an
object
of
permanent
beauty
your
friends
think
of
you
whenever
they
look
upon
it
that
so
remarked
gilbert
to
nancy
this
is
true
no
doubt
but
there
are
other
ways
of
making
yourself
remembered
and
i
am
willing
that
you
should
think
kindly
of
cousin
ann
whenever
you
use
the
new
pump
the
second
improvement
i
wish
made
with
the
money
is
the
instalment
of
a
large
stove
in
the
cellar
which
will
send
up
a
little
heat
at
least
into
the
hall
and
lower
rooms
in
winter
you
will
probably
have
to
get
the
consent
and
i
should
certainly
ask
for
a
five
years
lease
before
expending
any
considerable
amount
of
money
on
the
premises
if
there
is
any
money
left
i
should
suggest
new
sills
to
the
back
doors
and
those
in
the
shed
i
noticed
that
the
present
ones
are
very
rotten
and
i
dare
say
by
this
time
you
have
processions
of
red
and
black
ants
coming
into
your
house
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
never
saw
so
much
insect
life
as
in
beulah
moths
caterpillars
slugs
spiders
june
bugs
horseflies
and
mosquitoes
were
among
the
pests
i
specially
noted
the
popham
who
drove
me
to
the
station
said
that
snakes
also
abounded
in
the
tall
grass
but
i
should
not
lay
any
stress
on
his
remarks
as
i
never
saw
such
manners
in
my
life
in
any
christian
civilized
community
he
asked
me
my
age
and
when
i
naturally
made
no
reply
he
inquired
after
a
few
silence
whether
i
was
unmarried
from
choice
or
necessity
when
i
refused
to
carry
on
any
conversation
with
him
he
sang
jovial
songs
so
audibly
that
persons
going
along
the
street
smiled
and
waved
their
hands
to
him
i
tell
you
this
because
you
appear
to
have
false
ideas
of
the
people
in
beulah
most
of
whom
seemed
to
me
either
eccentric
or
absolutely
insane
hoping
that
you
can
endure
your
life
there
when
the
water
smells
better
and
you
do
not
have
to
carry
it
from
the
well
i
am
yours
affectionately
ann
chadwich
children
said
carey
folding
the
letter
and
slipping
the
check
into
the
envelope
for
safety
your
cousin
ann
is
really
a
very
good
woman
i
wish
her
bed
had
come
down
with
her
said
gilbert
we
could
never
have
afforded
to
get
that
water
into
the
house
or
had
the
little
furnace
and
i
suppose
though
no
one
of
us
ever
thought
of
it
that
you
would
have
had
a
hard
time
doing
the
work
in
the
winter
in
a
cold
house
and
it
would
have
been
dreadful
going
to
the
pump
dreadful
for
you
too
gilly
replied
kathleen
pointedly
i
shall
be
at
school
where
i
ca
help
said
gilbert
carey
made
no
remark
as
she
intended
the
fact
that
there
was
no
money
for
gilbert
tuition
at
eastover
to
sink
gradually
into
his
mind
so
that
he
might
make
the
painful
discovery
himself
his
fees
had
fortunately
been
paid
in
advance
up
to
the
end
of
the
summer
term
so
the
strain
on
their
resources
had
not
been
felt
up
to
now
nancy
had
disappeared
from
the
room
and
now
stood
in
the
doorway
i
wish
to
remark
that
having
said
a
good
many
disagreeable
things
about
cousin
ann
and
regretting
them
very
much
i
have
placed
the
four
black
and
white
marble
ornaments
on
my
bedroom
mantelpiece
there
to
be
a
perpetual
reminder
of
my
sins
you
dirty
boy
is
in
a
hundred
pieces
in
the
barn
chamber
but
if
cousin
ann
ever
comes
to
visit
us
again
be
the
one
to
confess
that
gilly
and
i
were
the
cause
of
the
accident
now
take
your
pencil
nancy
and
see
where
we
are
in
point
of
income
at
the
present
moment
her
mother
suggested
with
an
approving
smile
put
down
the
pension
of
thirty
dollars
a
month
three
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
now
the
hundred
dollars
over
and
above
the
rent
of
the
charlestown
house
down
but
it
lasts
only
four
years
we
may
all
be
dead
by
that
time
this
cheerfully
from
gilbert
then
the
interest
on
our
insurance
money
four
per
cent
on
five
thousand
dollars
is
two
hundred
i
have
multiplied
it
twenty
times
two
hundred
of
course
if
anything
serious
happens
or
any
great
need
comes
we
have
the
five
thousand
to
draw
upon
interpolated
gilbert
i
will
draw
upon
that
to
save
one
of
us
in
illness
or
to
bury
one
of
us
said
carey
with
determination
but
i
will
never
live
out
of
it
myself
nor
permit
you
to
we
are
five
six
while
julia
is
with
us
she
added
hastily
and
six
persons
will
surely
have
rainy
days
coming
to
them
what
if
i
should
die
and
leave
you
do
mother
they
cried
in
chorus
so
passionately
that
carey
changed
the
subject
quickly
how
much
a
year
does
it
make
nancy
three
hundred
and
sixty
plus
one
hundred
plus
two
hundred
equals
six
hundred
and
sixty
read
nancy
and
i
call
it
a
splendid
big
lump
of
money
oh
my
dear
sighed
her
mother
with
a
shake
of
the
head
if
you
knew
the
difficulty
your
father
and
i
have
had
to
take
care
of
ourselves
and
of
you
on
five
and
six
times
that
sum
we
may
have
been
a
little
extravagant
sometimes
following
him
about
he
was
always
so
anxious
to
have
us
with
him
but
that
has
been
our
only
luxury
we
saved
enough
out
of
exchanging
the
grand
piano
to
pay
all
the
expenses
down
here
and
all
our
railway
fares
and
everything
so
far
in
the
way
of
boards
and
nails
and
osh
popham
labor
recalled
gilbert
yes
and
we
are
still
eating
the
grand
piano
at
the
end
of
two
months
but
it
about
gone
is
it
muddy
nancy
asked
about
gone
but
it
has
been
a
great
help
and
our
dear
little
square
is
just
as
much
of
a
of
course
the
tapestry
and
the
van
twiller
landscape
uncle
gave
me
they
may
yet
be
sold
somebody
buy
the
tapestry
but
the
van
twiller
go
hard
and
gilbert
winked
at
nancy
a
picture
that
looks
just
the
same
upside
down
as
the
right
way
about
wo
find
many
buyers
was
nancy
idea
still
it
is
a
van
twiller
and
has
a
certain
authentic
value
for
all
time
the
landscapes
van
twiller
painted
in
the
dark
or
when
he
had
his
blinders
on
ca
be
worth
very
much
insisted
gilbert
you
remember
the
admiral
thought
it
was
partridges
nesting
in
the
underbrush
at
twilight
and
then
we
found
joanna
had
cleaned
the
dining
room
and
hung
the
thing
upside
down
when
it
was
hung
the
other
end
up
neither
father
nor
the
admiral
could
tell
what
it
was
they
lost
the
partridges
and
could
find
anything
else
we
shall
get
something
for
it
because
it
is
a
van
twiller
said
carey
hopefully
and
the
tapestry
is
now
we
have
been
doing
all
our
own
work
to
save
money
enough
to
make
the
house
beautiful
yet
as
cousin
ann
says
it
does
not
belong
to
us
and
may
be
taken
away
at
any
moment
after
the
year
is
up
we
have
never
even
seen
our
landlord
though
harmon
has
written
to
him
are
we
foolish
what
do
you
think
julia
xv
belonging
to
beulah
the
person
without
a
fault
had
been
quietly
working
at
her
embroidery
raising
her
head
now
and
then
to
look
at
some
extraordinary
carey
when
he
or
she
made
some
unusually
silly
or
fantastic
remark
i
not
so
old
as
gilbert
and
nancy
and
i
only
a
niece
she
said
modestly
so
i
ought
not
to
have
an
opinion
but
i
should
get
a
at
once
so
that
we
should
all
be
drudges
as
we
are
now
then
i
should
not
spend
a
single
cent
on
the
house
but
just
live
here
in
hiding
as
it
were
till
better
times
come
and
till
we
are
old
enough
to
go
into
society
you
could
scrimp
and
save
for
nancy
coming
out
and
then
for
kathleen
father
would
certainly
be
well
long
before
then
and
kathleen
and
i
could
debut
together
who
wants
to
together
or
any
other
way
sniffed
nancy
scornfully
i
coming
out
right
here
in
beulah
indeed
i
not
sure
but
i
out
already
bill
harmon
has
asked
me
to
come
to
the
church
sociable
and
popham
has
invited
me
to
the
red
men
picnic
at
greentown
beulah
good
for
something
better
than
a
place
to
hide
in
we
have
to
save
every
penny
at
first
of
course
but
in
three
or
four
years
gilly
and
i
ought
to
be
earning
something
the
trouble
is
i
earn
anything
in
college
objected
gilbert
though
i
like
to
that
will
be
the
only
way
a
college
course
can
come
to
you
now
gilbert
his
mother
said
quietly
you
know
nothing
of
the
expenses
involved
they
would
have
taxed
our
resources
to
the
utmost
if
father
had
lived
and
we
had
had
our
more
than
five
thousand
a
year
you
and
i
together
must
think
out
your
problem
this
summer
gilbert
looked
blank
and
walked
to
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
should
lose
all
my
friends
and
it
hard
for
a
fellow
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
if
he
has
nothing
to
recommend
him
but
his
graduation
from
some
little
hole
like
beulah
academy
nancy
looked
as
if
she
could
scalp
her
brother
when
he
alluded
to
her
beloved
village
in
these
terms
but
her
mother
warning
look
stopped
any
comment
julia
took
up
arms
for
her
cousin
we
ought
to
go
without
everything
for
the
sake
of
sending
gilbert
to
college
she
said
gladys
ferguson
does
know
a
single
boy
who
is
going
to
harvard
or
yale
if
a
boy
of
good
family
and
good
breeding
can
not
make
friends
by
his
own
personality
and
his
own
qualities
of
mind
and
character
i
should
think
he
would
better
go
without
them
said
gilbert
mother
casually
do
you
believe
in
a
college
education
mother
inquired
gilbert
in
an
astonished
tone
certainly
why
else
should
we
have
made
sacrifices
to
send
you
to
begin
with
it
is
much
simpler
and
easier
to
be
educated
in
college
you
have
a
thousand
helps
and
encouragements
that
other
fellows
have
to
get
as
they
may
the
paths
are
all
made
straight
for
the
students
a
stupid
boy
or
one
with
small
industry
or
little
originality
must
have
drummed
into
him
in
four
years
with
all
the
splendid
teaching
energy
that
the
colleges
employ
it
requires
a
very
high
grade
of
mental
and
moral
power
to
do
without
such
helps
and
it
may
be
that
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
succeed
without
them
i
do
not
know
your
possibilities
yet
gilbert
and
neither
do
you
know
them
yourself
gilbert
looked
rather
nonplussed
pretty
stiff
i
call
it
he
grumbled
to
say
that
if
you
got
brains
enough
you
can
do
without
college
it
is
true
nevertheless
if
you
have
brains
enough
and
will
enough
and
heart
enough
you
can
stay
here
in
beulah
and
make
the
universe
search
you
out
and
drag
you
into
the
open
where
men
have
need
of
you
carey
eyes
shone
and
her
cheeks
glowed
what
we
all
want
as
a
family
is
to
keep
well
and
strong
and
good
in
body
and
mind
and
soul
to
conquer
our
weaknesses
to
train
our
gifts
to
harness
our
powers
to
some
end
and
then
with
all
our
might
ca
my
girls
be
fine
women
fit
for
new
york
or
washington
london
or
paris
because
their
young
days
were
passed
in
beulah
ca
my
boys
be
anything
that
their
brains
and
courage
fit
them
for
whether
they
make
their
own
associations
or
have
them
made
for
them
father
would
never
have
flung
the
burden
on
your
shoulders
gilbert
but
he
is
no
longer
here
you
ca
have
the
help
of
yale
or
harvard
or
bowdoin
to
make
a
man
of
you
my
son
you
will
have
to
fight
your
own
battles
and
win
your
own
spurs
oh
mother
but
you
splendid
cried
nancy
the
quick
tears
in
her
eyes
brace
up
old
gilly
and
show
what
the
careys
can
do
without
brace
up
kitty
and
julia
we
three
will
make
beulah
academy
ring
next
year
and
i
do
want
you
to
look
upon
beulah
as
a
place
of
hiding
while
adversity
lasts
said
mother
carey
we
must
make
it
home
as
beautiful
and
complete
as
we
can
afford
one
real
home
always
makes
others
i
am
sure
of
that
we
will
ask
harmon
to
write
hamilton
and
see
if
he
will
promise
to
leave
us
undisturbed
we
can
not
be
happy
or
prosperous
or
useful
or
successful
unless
we
can
contrive
to
make
the
yellow
house
a
home
the
river
is
our
river
the
village
is
our
village
the
people
are
our
neighbors
beulah
belongs
to
us
and
we
belong
to
beulah
do
we
peter
mother
carey
always
turned
to
peter
with
some
nonsensical
appeal
when
her
heart
was
full
and
her
voice
a
trifle
unsteady
you
could
bury
your
head
in
peter
little
white
sailor
jacket
just
under
his
chin
at
which
he
would
dimple
and
gurgle
and
chuckle
and
wriggle
and
when
you
withdrew
your
flushed
face
and
presented
it
to
the
public
gaze
all
the
tears
would
have
been
wiped
off
on
peter
so
on
this
occasion
did
carey
repeat
as
she
set
peter
down
we
belong
to
beulah
dear
yes
we
does
he
lisped
and
i
going
to
work
myself
pretty
soon
bimebye
just
after
a
while
when
i
a
little
more
grown
up
and
then
i
buy
the
yellow
house
quick
so
you
shall
precious
cried
kathleen
i
was
measured
on
muddy
this
morning
was
i
muddy
and
i
was
half
way
to
her
belt
and
in
charlestown
i
was
only
a
little
farder
up
than
her
knees
all
the
time
i
growing
up
she
ungrowing
down
smallering
and
i
biggering
are
you
afraid
your
mother
be
too
small
sweet
pete
asked
carey
no
this
very
stoutly
danny
harmon
mother
more
up
to
the
mantelpiece
and
i
hate
to
have
my
mother
so
far
away
said
peter
as
he
embraced
carey
knees
julia
had
said
little
during
this
long
conversation
though
her
mind
was
fairly
bristling
with
objections
and
negatives
and
different
points
of
view
but
she
was
always
more
or
less
awed
by
her
aunt
margaret
and
never
dared
defy
her
opinion
she
had
a
real
admiration
for
her
beauty
and
dignity
and
radiant
presence
though
it
is
to
be
feared
she
cared
less
for
the
qualities
of
character
that
made
her
personality
so
luminous
with
charm
for
everybody
she
saw
people
look
at
her
listen
to
her
follow
her
with
their
eyes
comment
on
her
appearance
her
elegance
and
her
distinction
and
all
this
impressed
her
deeply
as
to
cousin
ann
present
her
most
prominent
feeling
was
that
it
would
have
been
much
better
if
that
lady
had
followed
her
original
plan
of
sending
individual
checks
in
that
event
she
julia
was
quite
certain
that
hers
never
would
have
gone
into
a
or
a
oh
kathleen
sighed
nancy
as
the
two
went
into
the
kitchen
together
is
mother
the
most
interesting
you
ever
listened
to
i
love
to
hear
her
do
it
especially
when
somebody
else
is
getting
it
when
it
i
i
grow
smaller
and
smaller
curling
myself
up
like
a
little
worm
then
when
she
has
finished
i
squirm
to
the
door
and
wriggle
out
other
mothers
say
you
do
i
shall
tell
your
father
as
i
tell
you
and
ask
no
questions
never
heard
of
such
behavior
in
my
life
you
any
sense
of
propriety
this
happens
again
i
shall
have
to
do
something
desperate
the
room
at
once
and
so
on
but
mother
sets
you
to
thinking
mother
does
really
scold
kathleen
objected
no
but
she
shows
you
how
wrong
you
are
just
the
same
did
you
notice
how
julia
when
mother
said
we
were
not
to
look
upon
beulah
as
a
place
of
hiding
she
did
stay
withered
long
kathleen
remarked
and
she
said
just
the
right
thing
to
dear
old
gilly
for
fred
bascom
is
filling
his
head
with
foolish
notions
he
needs
father
to
set
him
right
we
all
need
father
sighed
kitty
tearfully
but
somehow
mother
grows
a
little
more
splendid
every
day
i
believe
she
trying
to
fill
father
place
and
be
herself
too

picture
and
the
children
are
a
first
class
crop
and
no
mistake
they
will
not
lay
out
much
at
first
as
they
are

turrible
hot
wether

you
i
never

jest
what
kind
of
a
job
an
american
counsul

but
i
guess
he
aint
never
het
up
with
overwork
there
was
a
piece
in
a
portland
paper
about
a
counsul
somewhere
being
fired
because
he
set
in
his
durin
office
hours

all
the
better
for
him
and
us
bill
letter
from
miss
nancy
carey
to
the
hon
lemuel
hamilton
beulah
dear
hamilton
i
am
nancy
the
oldest
of
the
carey
children
who
live
in
your
house
when
father
was
alive
he
took
us
on
a
driving
trip
and
we
stopped
and
had
luncheon
under
your
big
maple
and
fell
in
love
with
your
empty
house
father
he
was
a
captain
in
the
navy
and
there
was
never
anybody
like
him
in
the
world
father
leaned
over
the
gate
and
said
if
he
was
only
rich
he
would
drive
the
horse
into
the
barn
and
buy
the
place
that
very
day
and
mother
said
it
would
be
a
beautiful
spot
to
bring
up
a
family
we
children
had
wriggled
under
the
fence
and
were
climbing
the
apple
trees
by
that
time
and
we
wanted
to
be
brought
up
there
that
very
minute
we
all
of
us
look
back
to
that
day
as
the
happiest
one
that
we
can
remember
mother
laughs
when
i
talk
of
looking
back
because
i
am
not
sixteen
yet
but
i
think
although
we
did
not
know
it
god
knew
that
father
was
going
to
die
and
we
were
going
to
live
in
that
very
spot
afterwards
father
asked
us
what
we
could
do
for
the
place
that
had
been
so
hospitable
to
us
and
i
remembered
a
box
of
plants
in
the
carryall
that
we
had
bought
at
a
wayside
nursery
for
the
flower
beds
in
charlestown
plant
something
i
said
and
father
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
and
took
a
little
crimson
rambler
rose
bush
from
the
box
each
of
us
helped
make
the
place
for
it
by
taking
a
turn
with
the
luncheon
knives
and
spoons
then
i
planted
the
rose
and
father
took
off
his
hat
and
said
three
cheers
for
the
yellow
house
and
mother
added
god
bless
it
and
the
children
who
come
to
live
in
it
there
is
surely
something
strange
in
that
do
you
think
so
then
when
father
died
last
year
we
had
to
find
a
cheap
and
quiet
place
to
live
and
i
remembered
the
yellow
house
in
beulah
and
told
mother
my
idea
she
does
not
say
bosh
like
some
mothers
but
if
our
ideas
sound
like
anything
she
tries
them
so
she
sent
gilbert
to
see
if
the
house
was
still
vacant
and
when
we
found
it
was
we
took
it
the
rent
is
sixty
dollars
a
year
as
i
suppose
bill
harmon
told
you
when
he
sent
you
mother
check
for
fifteen
dollars
for
the
first
quarter
we
think
it
is
very
reasonable
and
do
not
wonder
you
do
like
to
spend
anything
on
repairs
or
improvements
for
us
as
you
have
to
pay
taxes
and
insurance
we
hope
you
will
have
a
good
deal
over
for
your
own
use
out
of
our
rent
as
we
should
like
to
feel
under
obligation
if
we
had
a
million
we
spend
it
all
on
the
yellow
house
because
we
are
fond
of
it
in
the
way
you
are
fond
of
a
person
it
not
only
that
we
want
to
paint
it
and
paper
it
but
we
would
like
to
pat
it
and
squeeze
it
if
you
ca
live
in
it
yourself
even
in
the
summer
perhaps
you
will
be
glad
to
know
we
love
it
so
much
and
want
to
take
good
care
of
it
always
what
troubles
us
is
the
fear
that
you
will
take
it
away
or
sell
it
to
somebody
before
gilbert
and
i
are
grown
up
and
have
earned
money
enough
to
buy
it
it
was
cousin
ann
that
put
the
idea
into
our
heads
but
everybody
says
it
is
quite
likely
and
sensible
cousin
ann
has
made
us
a
splendid
present
of
enough
money
to
bring
the
water
from
the
well
into
the
kitchen
sink
and
to
put
a
large
stove
like
a
furnace
into
the
cellar
we
would
cut
two
registers
behind
the
doors
in
the
and
floors
and
two
little
round
holes
in
the
ceilings
to
let
the
heat
up
into
two
bedrooms
if
you
are
willing
to
let
us
do
it
mother
says
that
cousin
ann
is
a
good
and
generous
person
it
is
true
and
it
makes
us
very
unhappy
that
we
can
not
really
love
her
on
account
of
her
being
so
but
you
being
an
american
consul
and
travelling
all
over
the
world
must
have
seen
somebody
like
her
harmon
is
writing
to
you
but
i
thought
he
would
know
so
much
about
us
as
i
do
we
have
father
pension
that
is
three
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
a
year
and
one
hundred
dollars
a
year
from
the
charlestown
house
but
that
only
lasts
for
four
years
and
two
hundred
dollars
a
year
from
the
interest
on
father
insurance
that
makes
six
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
which
is
a
great
deal
if
you
have
been
used
to
three
thousand
but
does
not
seem
to
be
enough
for
a
family
of
six
there
is
the
insurance
money
itself
too
but
mother
says
nothing
but
a
very
dreadful
need
must
make
us
touch
that
you
see
there
are
four
of
us
children
which
with
mother
makes
five
and
now
there
is
julia
which
makes
six
she
is
uncle
allan
only
child
uncle
allan
has
nervous
prostration
and
all
of
mother
money
we
are
not
poor
at
all
just
now
on
account
of
having
exchanged
the
grand
piano
for
an
square
and
eating
up
the
extra
money
it
is
great
fun
and
whenever
we
have
anything
very
good
for
supper
kathleen
says
here
goes
a
piano
leg
and
gilbert
says
let
have
an
octave
of
white
notes
for
sunday
supper
mother
i
send
you
a
little
photograph
of
the
family
taken
together
on
your
side
piazza
we
call
it
our
piazza
and
i
hope
you
do
mind
i
am
the
tallest
girl
with
the
curly
hair
julia
is
sitting
down
in
front
hemming
she
said
we
should
look
so
idle
if
somebody
did
do
something
but
she
never
really
hems
and
kathleen
is
leaning
over
mother
shoulder
we
all
wanted
to
lean
over
mother
shoulder
but
kitty
got
there
first
the
big
boy
is
gilbert
he
ca
go
to
college
now
as
father
intended
and
he
is
very
sad
and
depressed
but
mother
says
he
has
a
splendid
chance
to
show
what
father
son
can
do
without
any
help
but
his
own
industry
and
pluck
please
look
carefully
at
the
lady
sitting
in
the
chair
for
it
is
our
mother
it
is
only
a
snap
shot
but
you
can
see
how
beautiful
she
is
her
hair
is
very
long
and
the
wave
in
it
is
natural
the
little
boy
is
peter
he
is
the
loveliest
and
the
dearest
of
all
of
us
the
second
picture
is
of
me
tying
up
the
crimson
rambler
i
thought
you
would
like
to
see
what
a
wonderful
rose
it
is
i
was
standing
in
a
chair
training
the
long
branches
and
tacking
them
against
the
house
when
a
gentleman
drove
by
with
a
camera
in
his
wagon
he
stopped
and
took
the
picture
and
sent
us
one
explaining
that
every
one
admired
it
i
happened
to
be
wearing
my
yellow
muslin
and
i
am
sending
you
the
one
the
gentleman
colored
because
it
is
the
beautiful
crimson
of
the
rose
against
the
yellow
house
that
makes
people
admire
it
so
if
you
come
to
america
please
do
forget
beulah
because
if
you
once
saw
mother
you
could
never
bear
to
disturb
her
seeing
how
brave
she
is
living
without
father
admiral
southwick
who
is
in
china
calls
us
mother
carey
chickens
they
are
stormy
petrels
and
are
supposed
to
go
out
over
the
seas
and
show
good
birds
the
way
home
we
have
done
anything
splendid
yet
but
we
mean
to
when
the
chance
comes
i
have
told
anybody
that
i
am
writing
this
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
everything
about
us
as
you
are
our
landlord
we
could
be
so
happy
if
cousin
ann
would
always
say
we
are
spending
money
on
another
person
house
and
such
a
silly
performance
never
came
to
any
good
i
enclose
you
a
little
picture
cut
from
the
wall
paper
we
want
to
put
on
the
front
hall
hoping
you
will
like
it
the
old
paper
is
hanging
in
shreds
and
some
of
the
plaster
is
loose
but
popham
will
make
it
all
right
mother
says
she
feels
as
if
he
had
pasted
laughter
and
good
nature
on
all
the
walls
as
he
papered
them
when
you
open
the
front
door
and
we
hope
you
will
sometime
and
walk
right
in
how
lovely
it
will
be
to
look
into
yellow
hayfields
and
is
the
boatful
of
people
coming
to
the
haymaking
nice
with
the
bright
shirts
of
the
men
and
the
women
scarlet
aprons
do
you
love
the
white
horse
in
the
haycart
and
the
jolly
party
picnicking
under
the
tree
mother
says
just
think
of
buying
so
much
joy
and
color
for
twenty
cents
a
double
roll
and
we
children
think
we
shall
never
get
tired
of
sitting
on
the
stairs
in
cold
weather
and
making
believe
it
is
haying
time
gilbert
says
we
are
putting
another
grand
piano
leg
on
the
walls
but
we
are
not
for
we
are
doing
all
our
own
cooking
and
dishwashing
and
saving
the
money
that
a
cook
would
cost
to
do
lovely
things
for
the
yellow
house
thank
you
dearest
hamilton
for
letting
us
live
in
it
we
are
very
proud
of
the
circular
steps
and
very
proud
of
your
being
an
american
consul
yours
affectionately
nancy
carey

a
place

older
than

but

the
right
size
for
me
to
send
my
love
to
please
do
it
mother
would
wish
to
be
remembered
to
hamilton
but
she
will
never
know
i
am
writing
to
you
it
is
my
first
business
letter
xvii
jack
of
all
trades
ossian
otherwise
osh
popham
was
covering
the
hall
of
the
yellow
house
with
the
hayfield
paper
bill
harmon
father
had
left
considerable
stock
of
one
sort
and
another
in
the
great
unfinished
attic
over
the
store
and
though
much
of
it
was
worthless
and
all
of
it
was
out
of
date
it
seemed
probable
that
it
would
eventually
be
sold
to
the
careys
who
had
the
most
unlimited
ingenuity
in
making
bricks
without
straw
when
it
came
to
house
decoration
they
had
always
moved
from
post
to
pillar
and
dan
to
beersheba
and
had
always
inside
of
a
week
had
the
prettiest
and
most
delightful
habitation
in
the
naval
colony
where
they
found
themselves
beulah
itself
as
well
as
all
the
surrounding
country
had
looked
upon
the
golden
hayfield
paper
and
scorned
it
as
ugly
and
countrified
never
suspecting
that
in
its
day
it
had
been
made
in
france
and
cost
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
roll
it
had
been
imported
for
a
governor
house
and
only
half
of
it
used
so
for
thirty
years
the
other
half
had
waited
for
the
careys
there
always
are
careys
and
their
like
and
plenty
of
them
in
every
generation
so
old
things
if
they
are
good
need
never
be
discouraged
popham
never
worked
at
his
bricklaying
or
carpentering
or
cabinet
making
or
papering
by
the
hour
but
by
the
job
and
a
kind
providence
intent
on
the
welfare
of
the
community
must
have
guided
him
in
this
choice
of
business
methods
for
he
talked
so
much
more
than
he
worked
that
unless
householders
were
the
rights
of
employer
and
employee
could
never
have
been
adjusted
if
they
were
rich
no
one
of
them
would
have
stopped
ossian
conversation
for
a
second
in
the
first
place
it
was
even
better
than
his
work
which
was
always
good
and
in
the
second
place
he
would
never
consent
to
go
to
any
one
unless
he
could
talk
as
much
as
he
liked
the
careys
loved
him
all
but
julia
who
pronounced
him
common
and
said
miss
tewksbury
told
her
never
to
listen
to
anyone
who
said
i
done
it
or
i
seen
it
to
this
nancy
replied
her
mother
being
in
the
garden
and
she
herself
not
yet
started
on
a
line
of
conduct
arranged
to
please
the
angels
that
miss
tewksbury
and
julia
ought
to
have
a
little
corner
of
heaven
finished
off
for
themselves
and
julia
made
a
rude
distinct
hideous
face
at
nancy
i
have
always
dated
the
beginning
of
julia
final
transformation
from
this
critical
moment
when
the
old
adam
in
her
began
to
work
it
was
good
for
nancy
too
who
would
have
trodden
on
julia
so
long
as
she
was
an
irritating
but
patient
worm
but
who
would
have
to
use
a
little
care
if
the
worm
showed
signs
of
turning
your
tongue
is
like
a
bread
knife
nancy
carey
julia
exclaimed
passionately
after
twisting
her
nose
and
mouth
into
terrifying
and
dreadful
shapes
if
it
was
that
miss
tewksbury
told
me
ladies
never
were
telltales
i
could
soon
make
trouble
between
you
and
your
blessed
mother
no
you
could
said
nancy
curtly
for
i
reform
sooner
than
let
you
do
that
perhaps
i
did
say
too
much
julia
only
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
make
game
of
popham
when
he
so
funny
and
nice
think
of
his
living
with
nagging
popham
and
his
stupid
daughter
and
son
in
that
tiny
house
and
being
happy
as
a
king
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
he
would
happy
there
insisted
julia
popham
himself
accounted
for
his
contentment
without
insulting
his
intelligence
the
way
i
look
at
it
he
said
this
world
all
the
world
we
git
till
we
git
to
the
next
one
an
we
might
well
smile
on
it
frown
you
git
your
piece
o
life
an
you
make
what
you
can
of
it
that
the
idee
now
the
other
day
i
got
some
nice
soft
wood
that
was
prime
for
whittlin
jest
the
right
color
an
grain
an
all
an
i
started
in
to
make
a
little
statue
o
the
duke
o
wellington
well
when
i
got
to
shapin
him
out
i
found
my
piece
o
wood
would
be
long
enough
to
give
him
his
height
so
i
says
i
do
care
i
cut
the
duke
right
down
and
make
napoleon
bonaparte
i
been
all
right
if
i
better
but
i
cut
my
block
off
too
short
and
i
could
make
napoleon
nohow
so
i
says
isaac
watts
was
an
awful
short
man
so
i
guess
i
make
him
but
this
time
my
wood
split
right
in
two
some
men
would
been
discouraged
but
i
was
not
a
mite
i
jest
said
never
did
fancy
ike
watts
an
there
one
thing
this
blamed
chip
make
an
that
a
button
for
the
barn
door
osh
not
only
whittled
and
papered
and
painted
but
did
anything
whatsoever
that
needed
to
be
done
on
the
premises
if
the
pump
refused
to
draw
water
or
the
sink
drain
was
stopped
or
the
gutters
needed
cleaning
or
the
grass
had
to
be
mowed
he
was
the
man
ordained
by
providence
and
his
own
versatility
to
do
the
work
while
he
was
papering
the
front
hall
the
entire
carey
family
lived
on
the
stairs
between
meals
fearful
lest
they
should
lose
any
incident
any
anecdote
any
story
any
reminiscence
that
might
fall
from
his
lips
carey
took
her
mending
basket
and
sat
in
the
doorway
within
ear
shot
while
peter
had
all
the
scraps
of
paper
and
a
small
pasting
board
on
the
steps
where
he
conducted
his
private
enterprises
osh
would
cut
his
length
of
paper
lay
it
flat
on
the
board
and
apply
the
wide
brush
up
and
down
neatly
while
he
began
his
story
sometimes
if
the
tale
were
long
and
interesting
the
paste
would
dry
but
in
that
case
he
went
over
the
surface
again
at
the
precise
moment
of
hanging
the
flow
of
his
eloquence
stopped
abruptly
and
his
hearers
had
to
wait
until
the
piece
was
finished
before
they
learned
what
finally
became
of
lyddy
brown
after
she
drove
her
husband
ou
doors
or
of
bill
harmon
bull
terrier
who
set
an
entire
community
quarreling
among
themselves
his
racy
accounts
of
popham
pessimism
which
had
grown
prodigiously
from
living
in
the
house
with
his
optimism
his
anecdotes
of
lallie
joy
popham
who
was
given
to
moods
having
inherited
portions
of
her
father
incurable
hopefulness
and
fragments
of
her
ineradicable
gloom
these
were
of
a
character
that
made
the
finishing
of
the
hall
a
matter
of
profound
unimportance
i
ai
one
to
hurry
he
would
say
genially
that
the
reason
i
wo
work
by
the
hour
or
by
the
day
we
got
one
in
the
family
and
that
enough
for
lallie
joy
me
mis
popham
does
everything
right
on
the
dot
an
lallie
joy
me
git
turrible
sick
seein
that
dot
hevin
our
drawed
to
it
if
we
see
it
mis
bill
harmon
another
well
you
jest
ask
bill
that
all
she
an
mis
popham
hev
been
at
it
for
fifteen
years
but
the
village
ai
ready
to
give
out
the
blue
ribbon
yet
last
week
my
wife
went
over
to
harmon
and
mis
harmon
said
she
was
goin
to
make
some
molasses
candy
that
mornin
well
my
wife
hurried
home
put
on
her
molasses
made
her
candy
cooled
it
and
worked
it
and
took
some
over
to
treat
mis
harmon
who
was
jest
gittin
her
kittle
out
from
under
the
sink
the
careys
laughed
heartily
at
this
evidence
of
popham
celerity
while
osh
as
pleased
as
possible
gave
one
dab
with
his
paste
brush
and
went
on
maria
blood
was
up
one
while
mis
bill
harmon
always
contrives
to
git
her
wash
out
the
earliest
of
a
monday
morning
yesterday
maria
got
up
daybreak
i
allers
tell
her
if
she
was
real
forehanded
she
eat
her
breakfast
overnight
and
by
half
past
five
she
hed
her
clothes
in
the
boiler
jest
as
she
was
lookin
out
the
kitchen
winder
for
signs
o
mis
bill
harmon
she
seen
her
start
for
her
side
door
with
a
big
basket
maria
was
so
mad
then
that
she
vowed
she
would
be
beat
so
she
dug
for
the
bedroom
and
slat
some
clean
sheets
and
piller
cases
out
of
a
bureau
drawer
run
into
the
yard
and
blamed
if
she
did
get
over
the
line
afore
mis
harmon
found
her
clothespins
good
old
osh
he
had
had
such
an
audience
for
years
for
beulah
knew
all
its
own
stories
thoroughly
and
although
it
valued
them
highly
it
did
not
care
to
hear
them
too
often
but
the
careys
were
absolutely
fresh
material
and
such
good
appreciative
listeners
carey
looked
so
handsome
when
she
wiped
the
tears
of
enjoyment
from
her
eyes
that
osh
told
bill
harmon
if
agin
the
law
you
would
want
to
kiss
her
every
time
she
laughed
well
the
hall
papering
was
luckily
to
be
paid
for
not
by
the
hour
but
by
an
incredibly
small
price
per
roll
and
everybody
was
pleased
nancy
kathleen
and
julia
sat
on
the
stairs
preparing
a
whiteweed
and
buttercup
border
for
the
spare
bedroom
according
to
a
plan
of
mother
carey
it
was
an
affair
of
time
as
it
involved
the
delicate
cutting
out
of
daisy
garlands
from
a
wider
bordering
filled
with
flowers
of
other
colors
and
proved
a
fascinating
occupation
gilbert
hovered
on
the
outskirts
of
the
hall
doing
odd
jobs
of
one
sort
and
another
and
learning
bits
of
every
trade
at
which
popham
was
expert
if
we
had
been
in
such
a
sweat
to
git
settled
remarked
osh
with
a
clip
of
his
big
shears
i
really
ought
to
have
plastered
this
front
entry
all
over
callin
for
paper
half
loud
as
was
for
plaster
old
parson
bradley
hed
been
a
farmer
afore
he
turned
minister
and
one
sunday
mornin
his
parish
was
thornin
him
to
pray
for
rain
so
he
says
knowest
o
lord
it
manure
this
land
wants
not
water
but
in
thy
mercy
send
rain
plenteously
upon
us
popham
said
gilbert
who
had
been
patiently
awaiting
his
opportunity
the
pieces
of
paper
are
cut
for
those
narrow
places
each
side
of
the
front
door
ca
i
paste
those
on
while
you
talk
to
us
you
can
handy
as
you
be
with
tools
there
ai
no
trick
to
it
most
anybody
can
be
a
paperer
as
parson
bradley
said
when
he
was
talkin
to
a
during
a
presidential
campaign
of
you
boys
perhaps
can
be
a
george
washington
and
another
may
rise
to
be
a
thomas
jefferson
any
of
you
the
lord
knows
can
be
a
james
k
polk
i
do
know
much
about
polk
said
gilbert
nobody
did
very
much
but
the
parson
hated
him
like
see
here
peter
i
ai
o
paste
you
used
up
a
quart
what
are
you
doin
out
there
anyway
i
heerd
o
paintin
the
town
i
guess
you
paperin
it
ai
you
peter
was
too
busy
and
too
eager
for
paste
to
reply
the
facts
of
the
case
being
that
while
popham
held
the
family
spellbound
by
his
conversation
he
himself
was
papering
the
outside
of
the
house
with
scraps
of
assorted
paper
as
high
up
as
his
short
arms
could
reach
there
another
thing
you
can
do
gilbert
continued
popham
mixed
a
pail
o
that
green
paint
same
as
your
mother
wanted
an
brought
you
a
brush
the
settin
room
has
a
good
nice
floor
matched
boards
no
hummocks
nor
hollers
all
as
flat
one
of
my
pancakes
an
not
a
knot
hole
in
it
anywheres
you
jest
put
your
first
coat
on
brushin
lengthways
o
the
boards
and
let
it
dry
good
let
your
folks
go
stepping
on
it
neither
the
minute
a
floor
painted
women
folks
are
crazy
to
git
int
the
room
they
want
their
black
alpacky
that
in
the
closet
an
the
lookin
glass
that
on
the
mantelpiece
or
the
feather
duster
that
hangin
on
the
winder
will
you
jest
pass
out
the
broom
that
behind
the
door
the
next
mornin
you
find
lots
o
little
spots
where
they
tiptoed
in
to
see
if
the
paint
dry
an
how
it
goin
to
look
where
i
work
they
most
allers
say
it
the
cat
well
that
answer
may
deceive
some
folks
but
would
do
slop
your
paint
gilbert
work
quick
an
neat
even
then
paintin
ai
no
trick
all
any
fool
the
lord
knows

the
house
of
lords
the
carey
children
had
only
found
it
by
accident
all
their
errands
took
them
down
the
main
street
to
the
village
to
the
popham
cottage
at
the
foot
of
a
little
lane
turning
towards
the
river
or
on
to
the
and
bill
harmon
store
or
to
colonel
wheeler
house
and
then
to
the
railway
station
one
afternoon
nancy
and
kathleen
had
walked
up
the
road
in
search
of
pastures
new
and
had
spied
down
in
a
distant
hollow
a
gloomy
grey
house
almost
surrounded
by
cedars
a
grove
of
poplars
to
the
left
of
it
only
made
the
prospect
more
depressing
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
great
sheet
of
water
near
by
floating
with
cow
lilies
and
pond
lilies
the
whole
aspect
of
the
place
would
have
been
unspeakably
dreary
nancy
asked
popham
who
lived
in
the
grey
house
behind
the
cedars
and
when
he
told
them
a
certain
henry
lord
his
two
children
and
housekeeper
they
fell
into
the
habit
of
speaking
of
the
place
as
the
house
of
lords
you
wo
never
see
nothin
of
said
popham
henry
lord
never
darkened
the
village
for
years
i
guess
and
the
young
ones
never
been
to
school
so
far
they
have
a
teacher
out
from
portland
tuesdays
and
fridays
and
the
rest
o
the
week
they
study
up
for
him
henry
as
much
of
a
hermit
if
he
lived
in
a
hut
on
a
mounting
an
he
bringing
up
the
children
so
they
be
jest
as
odd
he
is
is
the
mother
dead
carey
asked
yes
dead
these
four
years
an
a
good
job
for
her
too
it
an
awful
queer
world
not
that
i
could
make
a
better
one
i
allers
say
when
folks
grumble
if
you
was
given
the
materials
could
you
turn
out
a
better
world
than
this
is
and
when
it
come
to
that
what
if
you
hed
to
furnish
your
materials
same
as
the
lord
did
i
guess
you
be
put
to
it
well
as
i
say
it
an
awful
queer
world
they
clap
all
the
burglars
into
jail
and
the
murderers
and
the
i
allers
thought
a
gentle
reproof
would
be
enough
punishment
for
a
he
probably
has
a
lot
o
provocation
that
nobody
knows
and
the
firebugs
ca
think
o
the
right

something

cendenaries

nobody

if
i
was

lockup
this
information
was
delivered
in
the
intervals
of
covering
the
guest
chamber
walls
with
a
delightful
white
moire
paper
which
osh
always
alluded
to
as
the
white
maria
whether
in
memory
of
his
wife
christian
name
or
because
his
french
accent
was
not
up
to
the
mark
no
one
could
say
popham
exaggerated
nothing
but
on
the
contrary
left
much
unsaid
in
his
narrative
of
the
family
at
the
house
of
lords
henry
lord
with
the
degree
of
to
his
credit
had
been
professor
of
zoology
at
a
new
england
college
but
had
resigned
his
post
in
order
to
write
a
series
of
scientific
text
books
always
irritable
cold
indifferent
he
had
grown
rapidly
more
so
as
years
went
on
had
his
pale
timid
wife
been
a
rosy
plucky
tyrant
things
might
have
gone
otherwise
but
the
only
memories
the
two
children
possessed
were
of
bitter
words
and
reproaches
on
their
father
side
and
of
tears
and
sad
looks
on
their
mother
part
then
the
poor
little
shadow
of
a
woman
dropped
wearily
into
her
grave
and
a
certain
elderly
bangs
with
grey
hair
and
firm
chin
came
to
keep
house
and
do
the
work
a
lonelier
creature
than
olive
lord
at
sixteen
could
hardly
be
imagined
she
was
a
tiny
thing
for
her
years
with
a
little
white
oval
face
and
peaked
chin
pronounced
eyebrows
beautifully
arched
and
a
mass
of
tangled
untidy
dark
hair
her
only
interests
in
life
were
her
younger
brother
cyril
delicate
and
timid
and
in
continual
terror
of
his
father
and
a
passion
for
drawing
and
sketching
that
was
fairly
devouring
in
its
intensity
when
she
was
ten
she
drew
the
cat
and
the
dog
the
hens
and
chickens
and
colored
the
sketches
with
the
paints
her
mother
provided
whatever
appealed
to
her
sense
of
beauty
was
straightway
transferred
to
paper
or
canvas
then
for
the
three
years
before
her
mother
death
there
had
been
surreptitious
lessons
from
a
portland
teacher
paid
for
out
of
lord
house
allowance
for
one
of
his
chief
faults
was
an
incredible
parsimony
amounting
almost
to
miserliness
something
terrible
will
happen
to
olive
if
she
is
taught
to
use
her
talent
lord
pleaded
to
her
husband
she
is
wild
to
know
how
to
do
things
she
makes
effort
after
effort
trembling
with
eagerness
and
when
she
fails
to
reproduce
what
she
sees
she
works
herself
into
a
frenzy
of
grief
and
disappointment
you
better
give
her
lessons
in
lord
answered
they
are
cheaper
than
instruction
in
drawing
and
much
more
practical
so
olive
lived
and
struggled
and
grew
and
luckily
her
talent
was
such
a
passion
that
no
circumstances
could
crush
or
extinguish
it
she
worked
discovering
laws
and
making
rules
for
herself
since
she
had
no
helpers
when
she
could
not
make
a
rabbit
or
a
bird
look
real
on
paper
she
searched
in
her
father
books
for
pictures
of
its
bones
if
i
could
only
know
what
it
is
like
cyril
she
said
perhaps
its
would
look
so
flat
o
cyril
there
must
be
some
better
way
of
doing
i
just
draw
the
outline
of
an
animal
and
then
i
put
hairs
or
feathers
on
it
they
have
no
bodies
they
could
run
nor
move
just
pasteboard
why
do
you
do
flowers
and
houses
olive
inquired
cyril
solicitously
and
people
paint
fruit
and
dead
fish
on
platters
and
pitchers
of
lemonade
with
ice
in
why
do
you
try
things
like
those
i
suppose
they
easier
olive
returned
with
a
sigh
but
who
could
bear
to
do
them
when
there
are
living
breathing
moving
things
things
that
puzzle
you
by
looking
different
every
minute
no
i
keep
on
trying
and
when
you
get
a
little
older
we
run
away
together
and
live
and
learn
things
by
ourselves
in
some
place
where
father
can
never
find
us
he
would
search
so
do
worry
replied
cyril
quietly
and
the
two
looked
at
each
other
and
knew
that
it
was
so
there
in
the
cedar
hollow
then
lived
olive
lord
an
angry
resentful
little
creature
weighed
down
by
a
fierce
sense
of
injury
her
gloomy
young
heart
was
visited
by
frequent
storms
and
she
looked
as
unlovable
as
she
was
unloved
but
nancy
carey
never
shy
and
as
eager
to
give
herself
as
people
always
are
who
are
born
and
bred
in
joy
and
love
nancy
hopped
out
of
mother
carey
warm
nest
one
day
and
fixing
her
bright
eyes
and
sunny
hopeful
glance
on
the
lonely
frowning
little
neighbor
stretched
out
her
hand
in
friendship
olive
mournful
black
eyes
met
nancy
sparkling
brown
ones
her
hand
so
marvellously
full
of
skill
had
never
held
another
and
she
was
desperately
but
magnetism
flowed
from
nancy
as
electric
currents
from
a
battery
she
drew
olive
to
her
by
some
unknown
force
and
held
her
fast
not
realizing
at
the
moment
that
she
was
getting
as
much
as
she
gave
the
first
interview
purely
a
casual
one
took
place
on
the
edge
of
the
lily
pond
where
olive
was
sketching
frogs
and
where
nancy
went
for
it
proved
to
be
a
long
and
intimate
talk
and
when
carey
looked
out
of
her
bedroom
window
just
before
supper
she
saw
at
the
pasture
bars
the
two
girls
with
their
arms
round
each
other
and
their
cheeks
close
together
nancy
curly
chestnut
crop
shone
in
the
sun
and
olive
thick
black
plaits
looked
blacker
by
contrast
suddenly
she
flung
her
arms
round
nancy
neck
and
with
a
sob
darted
under
the
bars
and
across
the
fields
without
a
backward
glance
a
few
moments
later
nancy
entered
her
mother
room
her
arms
filled
with
treasures
from
the
woods
and
fields
oh
motherdy
she
cried
laying
down
her
flowers
and
taking
off
her
hat
i
found
such
a
friend
a
real
understanding
friend
and
it
the
girl
from
the
house
of
lords
she
wonderful
more
wonderful
than
anybody
we
ever
seen
anywhere
and
she
draws
better
than
the
teacher
in
charlestown
older
than
i
am
but
so
tiny
and
sad
and
shy
that
she
seems
like
a
child
oh
mother
there
always
so
much
spare
room
in
your
heart
for
you
took
in
julia
and
yet
we
never
felt
the
difference
wo
you
make
a
place
for
olive
there
never
was
anybody
needed
you
so
much
as
she
does
never
have
you
ever
lifted
a
stone
and
seen
the
pale
yellow
stunted
shoots
of
grass
under
it
and
have
you
gone
next
day
and
next
and
watched
the
little
blades
shoot
upward
spread
themselves
with
delight
grow
green
and
wax
strong
and
finally
warm
with
the
sun
cool
with
the
dew
vigorous
with
the
flow
of
sap
in
their
veins
seen
them
wave
their
green
tips
in
the
breeze
that
was
what
happened
to
olive
lord
when
she
and
cyril
were
drawn
into
a
different
family
circle
and
ran
in
and
out
of
the
yellow
house
with
the
busy
eager
group
of
mother
carey
chickens
xix
old
and
new
the
yellow
house
had
not
always
belonged
to
the
hamiltons
but
had
been
built
by
a
governor
of
the
state
when
he
retired
from
public
office
he
lived
only
a
few
years
and
it
then
passed
into
the
hands
of
lemuel
hamilton
grandfather
who
had
done
little
or
nothing
in
the
way
of
remodelling
the
buildings
governor
weatherby
had
harbored
no
extraordinary
ambition
regarding
architectural
excellence
for
he
was
not
a
rich
man
he
had
simply
built
a
large
comfortable
colonial
house
he
desired
no
gardens
no
luxurious
stables
no
fountains
nor
grottoes
no
bathroom
for
it
was
only
the
year
while
the
old
oaken
bucket
left
nothing
to
be
desired
as
a
means
of
dispensing
water
to
the
household
he
had
one
weakness
however
and
that
was
a
wish
to
make
the
front
of
the
house
as
impressive
as
possible
the
window
over
the
front
door
was
as
beautiful
a
window
as
any
in
the
county
and
the
doorway
itself
was
celebrated
throughout
the
state
it
had
a
wonderful
fan
light
and
side
lights
green
blind
doors
outside
of
the
white
painted
one
with
its
massive
brass
knocker
and
still
more
unique
and
impressive
it
had
for
its
approach
stone
steps
instead
of
the
usual
oblong
ones
the
large
blocks
of
granite
had
been
cut
so
that
each
of
the
four
steps
should
be
smaller
than
the
one
below
it
and
when
after
months
of
gossip
and
suspense
they
were
finally
laid
in
place
their
straight
edges
towards
the
house
and
their
expensive
curved
sides
to
the
road
a
procession
of
curious
persons
in
wagons
carryalls
buggies
and
gigs
wound
their
way
past
the
premises
the
governor
steps
brought
many
pilgrims
down
the
main
street
of
beulah
first
and
last
and
the
original
hamiltons
had
been
very
proud
of
them
pride
of
such
simple
things
as
stone
steps
had
died
out
of
the
hamilton
stock
in
the
course
of
years
and
the
house
had
been
so
long
vacant
that
no
one
but
lemuel
the
consul
remembered
any
of
its
charming
features
but
ossian
popham
when
he
pried
up
and
straightened
the
ancient
landmarks
had
much
to
say
of
the
wonderful
steps
there
so
much
goin
on
he
complained
as
he
puffed
and
pried
and
strained
and
rested
in
between
that
young
ones
wo
amount
to
nothin
fust
thing
you
know
my
boy
digby
says
to
me
this
mornin
when
i
asked
him
if
he
was
goin
to
the
county
fair
pop
i
goin
he
says
the
same
old
fair
every
year
land
sakes
when
i
was
a
boy
once
a
month
in
warm
weather
i
used
to
ask
father
if
i
could
walk
to
the
other
end
o
the
village
and
look
at
the
steps
that
used
to
be
the
liveliest
entertainment
parents
could
think
up
for
their
young
ones
an
it
a
heap
livelier
than
two
sermons
of
a
sunday
each
of
an
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
long
digby
a
lad
of
eighteen
and
master
of
only
one
trade
instead
of
a
dozen
like
his
father
had
been
deputed
to
paper
mother
carey
bedroom
while
she
moved
for
a
few
days
into
the
newly
fitted
guest
room
which
was
almost
too
beautiful
to
sleep
in
with
its
white
satiny
walls
its
yellow
and
green
garlands
hanging
from
the
ceiling
its
yellow
floor
and
its
old
white
chamber
set
repainted
by
the
faithful
and
clever
popham
the
chintz
parlor
once
governor
weatherby
study
was
finished
too
and
the
whole
family
looked
in
at
the
doors
a
dozen
times
a
day
with
admiring
exclamations
it
had
six
doors
opening
into
two
entries
one
small
bedroom
one
sitting
room
one
cellar
and
one
china
closet
a
passion
for
entrances
and
exits
having
been
the
whim
of
that
generation
if
the
truth
were
known
nancy
had
once
lighted
her
candle
and
slipped
downstairs
at
midnight
to
sit
on
the
parlor
sofa
and
feast
her
eyes
on
the
room
loveliness
gilbert
had
painted
the
white
matting
the
color
of
a
ripe
cherry
popham
had
washed
and
ironed
and
fluted
the
old
white
ruffled
muslin
curtains
from
the
charlestown
home
and
they
adorned
the
four
windows
it
was
the
north
room
on
the
left
as
you
entered
the
house
and
would
be
closed
during
the
cold
winter
months
so
it
was
fitted
entirely
for
summer
use
and
comfort
the
square
piano
looked
in
its
element
placed
across
one
corner
with
the
four
tall
silver
candlesticks
and
snuffer
tray
on
the
shining
mahogany
all
the
shabbiest
furniture
and
the
carey
furniture
was
mostly
shabby
was
covered
with
a
cheap
gay
chintz
and
crimson
jacqueminot
roses
clambered
all
over
the
wall
paper
so
that
the
room
was
a
cool
bower
of
beauty
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
were
the
double
parlors
of
the
time
made
into
a
great
living
room
here
was
gilbert
green
painted
floor
smooth
and
glossy
with
braided
rugs
bought
from
neighbors
in
east
beulah
here
all
the
gilbert
furniture
that
the
careys
had
kept
during
their
many
wanderings
here
all
the
quaint
chairs
that
bill
harmon
could
pick
up
at
a
small
price
here
were
two
noble
fireplaces
one
with
a
crane
and
iron
pot
filled
with
flowers
the
other
filled
sometimes
with
sprays
of
green
asparagus
and
sometimes
with
fragrant
hemlock
boughs
the
paper
was
one
in
which
green
rushes
and
grew
on
a
ground
and
anything
that
the
careys
did
not
possess
for
the
family
sitting
room
ossian
popham
went
straight
home
and
made
in
his
barn
he
could
make
a
or
an
table
a
box
lounge
and
the
mattress
to
put
on
top
of
it
or
a
low
table
for
games
and
puzzles
or
a
window
seat
he
could
polish
the
piano
and
then
sit
down
to
it
and
play
those
tassels
on
her
boots
or
marching
through
georgia
with
great
skill
he
could
paint
bunches
of
gold
grapes
and
leaves
on
the
rocker
and
as
soon
as
it
was
dry
could
sit
down
in
it
and
entertain
the
whole
family
without
charging
them
a
penny
the
housewarming
could
not
be
until
the
later
autumn
carey
had
decided
for
although
most
of
the
living
rooms
could
be
finished
cousin
ann
expensive
improvements
were
not
to
be
set
in
motion
until
bill
harmon
heard
from
hamilton
that
his
tenants
were
not
to
be
disturbed
for
at
least
three
years
the
house
which
was
daily
growing
into
a
home
was
full
of
the
busy
hum
of
labor
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
morning
till
night
and
there
was
hardly
a
moment
when
mother
carey
and
the
girls
were
not
transporting
articles
of
furniture
through
the
rooms
and
up
and
down
the
staircases
to
see
how
they
would
look
somewhere
else
this
indeed
had
been
the
diversion
of
their
simple
life
for
many
years
and
was
just
as
delightful
in
their
opinion
as
buying
new
things
any
carey
from
mother
down
to
peter
would
spring
from
his
chair
at
any
moment
and
assist
any
other
carey
to
move
a
sofa
a
bureau
a
piano
a
kitchen
stove
if
necessary
with
the
view
of
determining
if
it
would
add
a
new
zest
to
life
in
a
different
position
not
a
word
has
been
said
thus
far
about
the
yellow
house
barn
the
barn
that
the
fool
hamilton
boys
according
to
bill
harmon
theories
had
converted
from
a
place
of
practical
usefulness
and
possible
gain
into
something
that
would
make
a
cat
laugh
but
it
really
needs
a
chapter
to
itself
you
remember
that
holmes
says
of
certain
majestic
and
dignified
trees
that
they
ought
to
have
a
christian
name
like
other
folks
the
barn
in
the
same
way
deserves
more
distinction
than
a
paragraph
but
at
this
moment
it
was
being
used
as
a
storeroom
and
was
merely
awaiting
its
splendid
destiny
quite
unconscious
of
the
future
the
hamilton
boys
were
no
doubt
as
extravagant
and
thriftless
as
they
were
insane
but
the
careys
sympathized
with
their
extravagance
and
thriftlessness
and
insanity
so
heartily
in
this
particular
that
they
could
hardly
conceal
their
real
feelings
from
bill
harmon
nothing
could
so
have
accorded
with
their
secret
desires
as
the
fool
changes
made
by
the
crazy
hamilton
boys
irresponsible
and
frivolous
changes
that
could
never
have
been
compassed
by
the
careys
slender
income
they
had
no
money
to
purchase
horse
or
cow
or
pig
and
no
man
in
the
family
to
take
care
of
them
if
purchased
so
the
removal
of
stalls
and
all
the
necessary
appurtenances
for
the
care
of
cattle
was
no
source
of
grief
or
loss
to
them
a
good
floor
had
been
laid
over
the
old
one
and
stained
to
a
dark
color
the
ceiling
with
its
heavy
beams
was
almost
as
fine
as
some
old
oak
counterpart
in
an
english
hall
not
a
new
board
met
the
eye
old
weathered
lumber
everywhere
even
to
the
quaint
benches
that
lined
the
room
there
was
a
place
like
an
for
musicians
to
play
for
a
country
dance
or
for
tableaux
and
charades
in
fine
there
would
be
with
the
addition
of
carey
ideas
here
and
there
provision
for
frolics
and
diversions
of
any
sort
you
no
sooner
opened
the
door
and
peeped
in
though
few
of
the
beulah
villagers
had
ever
been
invited
to
do
so
by
the
gay
young
hamiltons
than
your
tongue
spontaneously
exclaimed
what
a
place
for
good
times
i
shall
out
here
nancy
announced
as
the
three
girls
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
surrounded
by
bedsteads
tables
bureaus
and
stoves
julia
you
can
where
you
like
but
i
shall
here
next
summer
you
be
only
seventeen
you
ca
come
out
objected
julia
conventionally
not
in
a
drawing
room
perhaps
but
perfectly
well
in
a
barn
even
you
and
kitty
youthful
as
you
will
still
be
can
attend
my
coming
out
party
in
a
barn
it
does
seem
proper
to
think
of
giving
entertainments
when
everybody
knows
our
circumstances
how
poor
we
are
julia
said
rebukingly
we
are
talking
of
next
summer
my
child
who
can
say
how
rich
we
shall
be
next
summer
a
party
could
be
given
in
this
barn
with
mother
to
play
the
piano
and
popham
the
fiddle
the
refreshments
would
be
incredibly
weak
lemonade
and
i
think
we
might
the
cake
as
they
do
for
church
sociables
julia
pride
was
wounded
beyond
concealment
at
this
humorously
intended
suggestion
of
nancy
of
course
if
aunt
margaret
approves
i
have
nothing
to
say
she
remarked
but
i
myself
would
never
come
to
any
private
party
where
refreshments
were
the
very
idea
is
horrible
i
out
in
the
barn
next
summer
muddy
nancy
called
to
her
mother
who
just
then
entered
the
door
if
we
are
poorer
than
ever
we
can
take
up
a
collection
to
defray
the
expenses
julia
and
kitty
would
look
so
attractive
going
about
with
tambourines
i
want
to
do
what
i
can
quickly
because
i
see
plainly
i
shall
have
to
marry
young
in
order
to
help
the
family
the
heroine
always
does
that
in
books
she
makes
a
worldly
marriage
with
a
rich
nobleman
in
order
that
her
sister
kitty
and
her
cousin
julia
may
have
a
good
education
i
do
know
where
you
get
your
ideas
nancy
said
her
mother
smiling
at
her
nonsense
you
certainly
never
read
half
a
dozen
novels
in
your
life
no
but
joanna
used
to
read
them
by
the
hundred
and
tell
me
the
stories
and
i
heard
father
read
aloud
to
you
and
the
older
girls
and
the
younger
teachers
used
to
discuss
them
at
school
oh
i
know
a
lot
about
life
as
it
is
in
books
and
i
just
waiting
to
see
if
any
of
it
really
happens
digby
popham
is
the
only
rich
nobleman
in
sight
for
you
nancy
kitty
said
teasingly
or
freckled
cyril
lord
interpolated
julia
he
looks
like
an
unbaked
pie
this
from
kitty
nancy
flushed
he
shy
and
unhappy
and
pale
and
no
wonder
but
as
nice
and
interesting
as
he
can
be
i
ca
see
it
julia
said
but
he
never
looks
at
anybody
or
talks
to
anybody
but
you
so
it
well
you
like
him
though
you
like
all
boys
for
that
matter
the
boys
return
the
compliment
asserted
kitty
mischievously
while
poor
you
and
i
sit
in
corners
come
come
dears
and
carey
joined
in
the
conversation
as
she
picked
up
a
pillow
before
returning
to
the
house
it
a
little
early
for
you
to
be
talking
about
rich
noblemen
is
it
nancy
followed
her
out
of
the
door
saying
as
she
thoughtfully
chewed
a
straw
muddy
i
do
believe
that
when
you
getting
on
to
sixteen
the
rich
nobleman
or
the
fairy
prince
or
the
wonderful
youngest
son
does
cross
your
mind
now
and
then
xx
the
painted
chamber
matters
were
in
this
state
of
forwardness
when
nancy
and
kathleen
looked
out
of
the
window
one
morning
and
saw
lallie
joy
popham
coming
down
the
street
she
lugged
butter
and
milk
regularly
to
the
careys
lugging
is
her
own
word
for
the
act
and
helped
them
in
many
ways
for
she
was
fairly
good
at
any
kind
of
housework
not
demanding
brains
nobody
could
say
why
some
of
ossian
popham
gifts
of
mind
and
conversation
had
not
descended
to
his
children
but
though
the
son
was
not
really
stupid
at
practical
work
lallie
joy
was
in
a
perpetual
state
of
coma
nancy
as
has
been
intimated
before
had
a
kind
of
tendency
to
reform
things
that
appeared
to
her
lacking
in
any
way
and
she
had
early
seized
upon
the
stolid
lallie
joy
as
a
worthy
object
there
she
comes
said
nancy
she
carries
two
quarts
of
milk
in
one
hand
and
two
pounds
of
butter
in
the
other
exactly
as
if
she
was
bending
under
the
weight
of
a
load
of
hay
i
run
down
into
the
kitchen
and
capture
her
for
a
half
hour
at
five
cents
she
can
peel
the
potatoes
first
and
while
they
boiling
she
can
slice
apples
for
sauce
have
her
chop
the
hash
do
coaxed
julia
for
that
was
her
special
work
the
knife
is
dull
beyond
words
why
do
you
get
popham
to
sharpen
it
it
a
poor
workman
that
complains
of
his
tools
columbus
discovered
america
in
an
open
boat
quoted
nancy
with
an
irritating
air
of
wisdom
that
may
be
so
julia
retorted
but
columbus
would
never
have
discovered
america
with
that
i
sure
of
is
lallie
joy
about
our
age
i
do
know
she
must
have
been
at
least
forty
when
she
was
born
and
that
would
make
her
now
what
you
suppose
would
wake
her
up
if
i
could
only
get
her
to
stand
straight
or
hold
her
head
up
or
let
her
hair
down
or
close
her
mouth
i
believe
i
stay
in
the
kitchen
and
appeal
to
her
better
feelings
a
little
this
morning
i
can
seed
the
raisins
for
the
bread
pudding
nancy
sat
in
the
shaker
rocker
by
the
sink
window
with
the
yellow
bowl
in
her
lap
her
cheeks
were
pink
her
eyes
were
bright
her
lips
were
red
her
hair
was
her
fingers
flew
and
a
gingham
apron
was
as
becoming
to
her
as
it
is
to
all
nice
girls
she
was
thoroughly
awake
was
nancy
and
there
could
not
have
been
a
greater
contrast
than
that
between
her
and
the
comatose
lallie
joy
who
sat
on
a
wooden
chair
with
her
feet
on
the
side
rounds
she
had
taken
off
her
turkey
red
sunbonnet
and
hung
it
on
the
where
its
color
violently
assaulted
her
flaming
locks
she
sat
wrong
she
held
the
potato
pan
wrong
and
the
potatoes
and
the
knife
wrong
there
seemed
to
be
no
sort
of
connection
between
her
mind
and
her
body
as
she
peeled
potatoes
and
nancy
seeded
raisins
the
conversation
was
something
like
this
how
did
you
chance
to
bring
the
butter
instead
of
lallie
joy
had
to
dress
me
up
to
go
to
the
store
and
get
a
new
hat
what
colored
trimming
did
you
get
same
as
old
do
they
keep
anything
but
magenta
yes
blue
why
did
you
try
blue
for
a
change
dunno
did
want
any
change
i
guess
do
you
like
magenta

your
hair
never
thought
o
my
hair
jest
thought
o
my
hat
well
you
see
lallie
joy
you
ca
change
your
hair
but
you
wear
magenta
hats
nor
red
sunbonnets
your
hair
is
handsome
enough
if
you
only
brush
it
right
i
guess
i
know
all
my
hair
and
how
red
is
the
boys
ask
me
if
pop
painted
it
why
do
you
strain
it
back
so
tight
keep
it
out
o
my
eyes
nonsense
you
need
drag
it
out
by
the
roots
why
do
you
tie
the
braids
with
strings
they
hold
an
i
hai
got
no
ribbons
why
do
you
buy
some
with
the
money

fourth
well

yards
of
old
christmas
ribbons

i
give
you
if

what

face

your
forehead

your
legs
in
good
working
order
uncomprehending
silence
on
lallie
joy
part
and
then
nancy
returned
to
the
onslaught
do
you
like
to
look
at
pretty
things
dunno
but
i
do
an
dunno
as
i
do
do

of
not
any
more
than
that
pop
thinks
some
of
queer
an
so
does
bill
harmon
long
silence
nancy
being
utterly
daunted
how
did
you
come
by
your
name
lallie
joy
lallie
out
of
a
book
named
lallie
rook
an
i
was
born
on
the
joy
steamboat
line
going
to
boston
oh
i
thought
joy
was
joy
line
the
only
joy
i
ever
heard
of
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
this
depressing
conversation
would
have
continued
if
the
two
girls
had
not
heard
loud
calls
from
gilbert
upstairs
lallie
joy
evinced
no
surprise
and
went
on
peeling
potatoes
she
might
have
been
a
sister
of
the
famous
casabianca
and
she
certainly
could
have
been
trusted
not
to
flee
from
any
burning
deck
whatever
the
provocation
come
and
see
what
we
found
digby
and
i
gilbert
cried
come
girls
come
mother
we
were
stripping
off
the
paper
because
popham
said
there
been
so
many
layers
on
the
walls
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
and
have
it
all
fresh
and
clean
so
just
now
as
i
was
working
over
the
mantel
piece
and
digby
on
the
long
wall
look
in
and
see
what
we
uncovered
carey
had
come
from
the
nursery
kitty
and
julia
from
the
garden
and
osh
popham
from
the
shed
and
they
all
gazed
with
joy
and
surprise
at
the
quaint
landscapes
that
had
been
painted
in
water
colors
before
the
day
of
wall
paper
had
come
popham
quickly
took
one
of
his
tools
and
began
on
another
side
of
the
room
they
worked
slowly
and
carefully
and
in
an
hour
or
two
the
pictures
stood
revealed
a
little
faded
in
color
but
beautifully
drawn
with
almost
nothing
of
any
moment
missing
from
the
scenes
ai
they
handsome
exclaimed
osh
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
family
surrounding
him
in
various
attitudes
of
ecstasy
but
they
too
faded
out
to
leave
they
be
ai
they
carey
you
have
to
cover
up
with
new
paper
wo
you
or
shall
you
let
me
put
a
coat
of
varnish
on
carey
shuddered
internally
no
popham
we
must
have
any
on
the
landscapes
yes
they
are
dreadfully
dim
and
faded
but
i
simply
can
not
have
them
covered
up
it
would
be
wicked
to
hide
them
said
nancy
oh
muddy
it
our
duty
to
write
to
hamilton
and
tell
him
about
them
he
would
certainly
take
the
house
away
from
us
if
he
could
see
how
beautiful
we
have
made
it
and
now
here
is
another
lovely
thing
to
tempt
him
could
anybody
give
up
this
painted
chamber
if
it
belonged
to
him
well
you
see
said
popham
assuringly
if
you
want
to
use
this
painted
chamber
much
you
got
to
live
in
beulah
an
lem
hamilton
ai
goin
to

popham
makes

go
to
bed
long
afore
i
ready
so
she
can
git
the
house
shut
up
in

season
then
soon
i
settled
down
an
bed
one
short
nap
she
says
time
you
was
up
ossian
mother
i
have
an
idea
cried
nancy
suddenly
as
popham
took
his
leave
and
the
family
went
out
into
the
hall
do
you
know
who
could
make
the
walls
look
as
they
used
to
my
dear
olive
lord
she
only
sixteen
objected
carey
but
she
a
natural
born
genius
you
wait
and
see
the
things
she
does
perhaps
i
could
take
her
into
town
and
get
some
suggestions
or
some
instruction
with
the
proper
materials
said
carey
and
i
suppose
she
could
experiment
on
some
small
space
behind
the
door
first
nothing
that
olive
does
would
ever
be
put
behind
anybody
door
nancy
answered
decisively
i
not
old
enough
to
know
anything
about
painting
of
course
except
that
good
landscapes
ought
not
to
be
reversible
like
our
van
twiller
but
there
something
about
pictures
that
makes
you
want
to
touch
them
and
love
them
so
began
the
happiest
most
wonderful
most
fruitful
autumn
of
olive
lord
life
when
she
spent
morning
after
morning
in
the
painted
chamber
refreshing
its
faded
tints
whoever
had
done
the
original
work
had
done
it
lovingly
and
well
and
olive
learned
many
a
lesson
while
she
was
following
the
lines
of
the
quaint
houses
like
those
on
old
china
renewing
the
green
of
the
feathery
elms
or
retracing
and
coloring
the
curious
sampler
trees
that
stood
straight
and
stiff
like
sentinels
in
the
corners
of
the
room
xxi
a
family
rhomboid
the
honorable
lemuel
hamilton
sat
in
the
private
office
of
the
american
consulate
in
breslau
germany
one
warm
day
in
july
the
post
had
been
brought
in
half
an
hour
before
and
he
had
two
open
letters
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
it
was
only
ten
of
a
bright
morning
but
he
looked
tired
and
worn
he
was
about
fifty
with
slightly
grey
hair
and
smoothly
shaven
face
he
must
have
been
merry
at
one
time
in
his
life
for
there
were
many
nice
little
around
his
eyes
but
somehow
these
seemed
to
have
faded
out
as
if
they
had
not
been
used
for
years
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
turned
down
to
increase
the
look
of
weariness
and
discontent
a
smile
had
crept
over
his
face
at
his
old
friend
bill
harmon
spelling
and
penmanship
for
a
missive
of
that
kind
seldom
came
to
the
american
consulate
when
the
second
letter
postmarked
beulah
first
struck
his
eye
he
could
not
imagine
why
he
should
have
another
correspondent
in
the
quaintly
named
little
village
he
had
read
nancy
letter
twice
now
and
still
he
sat
smoking
and
dreaming
with
an
occasional
glance
at
the
girlish
handwriting
or
a
twinkle
of
the
eye
at
the
of
some
particular
passage
his
own
girls
were
not
ready
writers
and
their
mother
generally
sent
their
messages
for
them
nancy
and
kitty
did
not
yet
write
nearly
as
well
as
they
talked
but
they
contrived
to
express
something
of
their
own
individuality
in
their
communications
which
were
free
and
fluent
though
childlike
and
crude
what
a
nice
girl
this
nancy
carey
must
be
thought
the
american
consul
this
is
such
a
jolly
confidential
gossipy
winsome
little
letter
her
first
letter
she
calls
it
alas
when
she
learns
how
a
few
years
later
there
will
be
no
charming
little
confidences
no
details
of
family
income
and
expenditures
no
glimpses
of
and
i
believe
i
should
know
the
whole
family
even
without
this
photograph
the
lady
sitting
in
the
chair
to
whom
the
photographer
snapshot
has
not
done
justice
is
worthy
of
praise
and
bill
harmon
what
a
pretty
piquant
curly
head
nancy
has
what
a
gay
vivacious
alert
spirited
expression
the
boy
is
handsome
and
gentlemanly
but
he
have
to
wake
up
or
nancy
will
be
the
man
of
the
family
the
girl
sitting
down
is
less
attractive
uncle
allan
daughter
and
consulting
the
letter
uncle
allan
has
nervous
prostration
and
all
of
mother
money
here
hamilton
gave
vent
to
audible
laughter
for
the
third
time
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
nancy
does
realize
with
what
perfection
her
somewhat
imperfect
english
states
the
case
he
thought
i
know
uncle
allan
like
a
book
from
his
resemblance
to
certain
other
unfortunate
gentlemen
who
have
nervous
prostration
in
combination
with
other
people
money
let
see
i
know
nancy
friendly
little
nancy
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
i
should
judge
i
know
uncle
allan
who
hems
in
photographs
but
not
otherwise
i
know
gilbert
who
is
depressed
at
having
to
make
his
own
way
the
small
boy
who
the
nicest
of
us
all
kitty
who
beat
all
the
others
in
getting
to
mother
shoulder
and
the
mother
herself
who
is
beautiful
and
does
say
to
her
children
ideas
and
refuses
to
touch
the
insurance
money
and
wants
gilbert
to
show
what
son
can
do
without
anybody
help
and
who
revels
in
the
color
and
joy
of
a
yellow
wall
paper
at
twenty
cents
a
roll
bless
their
simple
hearts
they
must
pay
any
rent
while
they
are
bringing
water
into
the
kitchen
and
making
expensive
improvements
and
what
hamilton
could
be
persuaded
to
live
in
the
yellow
house
to
think
of
any
wanting
to
settle
down
in
that
little
deserted
spot
beulah
where
the
only
sound
that
ever
strikes
one
ear
is
osh
popham
laugh
or
the
tinkle
of
a
cow
bell
oh
if
my
own
girls
would
write
me
letters
like
this
letting
me
see
how
their
minds
are
growing
how
they
are
taking
hold
of
life
above
all
what
is
in
their
hearts
well
little
miss
nancy
carey
honest
outspoken
confidential
clever
little
nancy
who
calls
me
her
hamilton
and
thanks
me
for
letting
her
live
in
my
yellow
house
you
shall
never
be
disturbed
and
if
you
and
gilbert
ever
earn
enough
money
to
buy
it
it
shall
go
to
you
cheap
there
not
one
of
my
brood
that
would
live
in
it
except
tom
perhaps
for
after
spending
three
hundred
dollars
they
even
got
tired
of
dancing
in
the
barn
on
saturday
nights
so
if
it
can
fall
into
the
hands
of
some
one
who
will
bring
a
blessing
on
it
good
old
granny
hamilton
will
rest
peacefully
in
her
grave
we
have
discoursed
in
another
place
of
family
circles
but
it
can
not
be
truthfully
said
that
at
any
moment
the
lemuel
hamiltons
had
ever
assumed
that
symmetrical
and
harmonious
shape
still
during
the
first
eight
or
ten
years
of
their
married
life
when
the
children
were
young
they
had
at
least
appeared
to
the
casual
eye
as
say
a
rectangular
parallelogram
a
little
later
the
cares
and
jolts
of
life
wrenched
the
right
angles
a
trifle
out
of
plumb
and
a
rhomboid
was
the
result
hamilton
had
money
of
her
own
but
wished
lemuel
to
amass
enough
fame
and
position
to
match
it
she
liked
a
diplomatic
life
if
her
husband
could
be
an
ambassador
but
she
thought
him
strangely
slow
in
achieving
this
dignity
no
pleasure
or
pride
in
her
husband
ability
to
serve
his
country
even
in
a
modest
position
ever
crossed
her
mind
she
had
no
desire
to
spend
her
valuable
time
in
various
poky
continental
towns
and
she
had
many
excuses
for
not
doing
so
the
proper
education
of
her
children
being
the
chief
among
them
luckily
for
her
good
and
desirable
schools
were
generally
at
an
easy
distance
from
the
shops
and
the
dressmakers
and
milliners
establishments
her
soul
loved
so
while
hamilton
did
his
daily
task
in
antwerp
hamilton
resided
mostly
in
brussels
or
paris
when
he
was
in
zittau
in
saxony
she
was
in
dresden
if
he
were
appointed
to
some
business
city
she
remained
with
him
several
months
each
year
and
spent
the
others
in
a
more
artistic
and
fashionable
locality
the
situation
was
growing
difficult
because
the
children
were
gradually
getting
beyond
school
age
although
there
still
remained
to
her
the
sacred
duty
of
settling
them
properly
in
life
agnes
her
mother
favorite
was
still
at
school
and
was
devoted
to
foreign
languages
foreign
manners
and
foreign
modes
of
life
edith
had
grown
restless
and
developed
an
uncomfortable
fondness
for
her
native
land
so
that
she
spent
most
of
her
time
with
her
mother
relatives
in
new
york
or
in
visiting
school
friends
here
or
there
the
boys
had
gone
far
away
jack
the
elder
to
texas
where
he
had
lost
what
money
his
father
and
mother
had
put
into
his
first
business
venture
thomas
the
younger
to
china
where
he
was
woefully
lonely
but
doing
well
in
business
a
really
good
diplomatic
appointment
in
a
large
and
important
city
would
have
enabled
hamilton
to
collect
some
of
his
scattered
sons
and
daughters
and
provide
them
with
the
background
for
which
his
wife
had
yearned
without
ceasing
and
very
audibly
for
years
but
hamilton
did
not
get
the
coveted
appointment
and
hamilton
did
not
specially
care
for
hamilton
when
he
failed
in
securing
the
things
she
wanted
this
was
the
time
when
the
began
to
fade
away
from
hamilton
eyes
just
for
lack
of
daily
use
and
it
was
then
that
the
corners
of
his
mouth
began
to
turn
down
and
his
shoulders
to
stoop
and
his
eye
to
grow
less
keen
and
brave
and
his
step
less
vigorous
it
may
be
a
commonplace
remark
but
it
is
not
at
these
precise
moments
in
life
that
tired
depressed
men
in
modest
positions
are
wafted
by
uncle
sam
to
great
and
desirable
heights
but
to
hamilton
it
appeared
that
her
husband
was
simply
indolent
unambitious
and
unlucky
not
at
all
that
he
needed
to
be
believed
in
or
loved
or
comforted
or
helped
or
braced
it
might
have
startled
her
and
hurt
her
wifely
pride
if
she
had
seen
her
lonely
husband
drinking
in
little
nancy
carey
letter
as
if
it
were
dew
to
a
thirsty
spirit
to
see
him
set
the
photograph
of
the
carey
group
on
his
desk
and
look
at
it
from
time
to
time
affectionately
as
if
he
had
found
some
new
friends
it
was
the
contentment
the
hope
the
unity
the
pluck
the
mutual
love
the
confidence
the
ambition
of
the
group
that
touched
his
imagination
and
made
his
heart
run
out
to
them
airs
from
the
eden
of
youth
awoke
and
stirred
in
his
soul
as
he
took
his
pen
to
answer
nancy
first
business
communication
having
completed
his
letter
he
lighted
another
cigar
and
leaning
back
in
his
revolving
chair
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
fell
into
a
reverie
the
various
diplomatic
posts
that
might
be
opened
to
him
crossed
his
mind
in
procession
if
a
or
b
or
c
were
possible
his
wife
would
be
content
and
their
combined
incomes
might
be
sufficient
to
bring
the
children
together
if
not
quite
under
one
roof
then
to
points
not
so
far
separated
from
each
other
but
that
a
speaking
acquaintance
might
be
developed
tom
was
the
farthest
away
and
he
was
the
dearest
the
only
hamilton
of
the
lot
the
only
one
who
loved
his
father
hamilton
leaned
forward
abstractedly
and
fumbling
through
one
drawer
of
his
desk
after
another
succeeded
in
bringing
out
a
photograph
of
tom
taken
at
seventeen
or
eighteen
then
by
a
little
extra
search
he
found
his
wife
in
her
presentation
dress
at
a
foreign
court
there
was
no
comfort
or
companionship
in
that
it
was
too
furbelowed
to
be
anybody
wife
but
underneath
it
in
the
same
frame
was
one
taken
just
after
their
marriage
that
was
too
full
of
memories
to
hold
much
joy
but
it
stirred
his
heart
and
made
it
beat
a
little
enough
at
any
rate
to
show
it
was
not
dead
in
the
letter
case
in
his
vest
pocket
was
an
almost
forgotten
picture
of
the
girls
when
they
were
children
this
with
the
others
he
stood
in
a
row
in
front
of
him
reminding
himself
that
he
did
not
know
the
subjects
much
more
intimately
than
the
photographers
who
had
made
their
likenesses
he
glanced
from
one
family
to
the
other
and
back
again
several
times
the
careys
were
handsomer
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
but
there
was
a
deeper
difference
that
eluded
him
the
hamiltons
were
far
more
stylishly
dressed
but
they
all
looked
a
little
conscious
and
a
little
discontented
that
was
it
the
careys
were
happier
there
were
six
of
them
living
in
the
forgotten
hamilton
house
in
a
village
on
five
or
six
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
doing
their
own
housework
and
they
were
happier
than
his
own
brood
spending
forty
or
fifty
times
that
sum
well
they
were
grown
up
his
sons
and
daughters
and
the
only
change
in
their
lives
now
would
come
from
wise
or
unwise
marriages
no
would
ever
come
into
the
family
with
hamilton
standing
at
the
bars
he
was
sure
of
that
as
for
the
boys
they
might
choose
their
mates
in
texas
or
china
they
might
even
have
chosen
them
now
for
aught
he
knew
though
jack
was
only
and
tom
he
must
write
to
them
oftener
all
of
them
no
matter
how
busy
and
anxious
he
might
be
especially
to
tom
who
was
so
far
away
he
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
him
and
having
filled
it
another
and
yet
another
having
folded
and
slipped
it
into
an
envelope
and
addressed
it
to
thomas
hamilton
hong
kong
china
he
was
about
to
seal
it
when
he
stopped
a
moment
i
enclose
the
little
carey
girl
letter
he
thought
tom
the
only
one
who
cares
a
penny
for
the
old
house
and
i
told
him
i
have
rented
it
he
a
generous
boy
and
he
wo
grudge
a
few
dollars
lost
to
a
good
cause
besides
these
careys
will
increase
the
value
of
the
property
every
year
they
live
in
it
and
without
them
the
buildings
would
gradually
have
fallen
into
ruins
he
added
a
postscript
to
his
letter
saying
i
sent
you
little
miss
letter
the
photograph
of
her
tying
up
the
rambler
rose
and
the
family
group
so
that
you
can
see
exactly
what
influenced
me
to
write
her
and
bill
harmon
that
they
should
be
undisturbed
in
their
tenancy
and
that
their
repairs
and
improvements
should
be
taken
in
lieu
of
rent
this
done
and
the
letters
stamped
he
put
the
photographs
of
his
wife
and
children
here
and
there
on
his
desk
and
left
the
office
oh
it
is
quite
certain
that
mother
carey
own
chickens
go
out
over
the
seas
and
show
good
birds
the
way
home
and
it
is
quite
true
as
she
said
one
real
home
always
makes
another
i
am
sure
of
that
it
can
even
send
a
vision
of
a
home
across
fields
and
forests
and
lakes
and
oceans
from
beulah
village
to
breslau
germany
and
on
to
hong
kong
china
xxii
cradle
gifts
henry
lord
sent
out
a
good
many
invitations
to
the
fairies
for
cyril
birthday
party
but
lord
was
at
his
critical
point
in
the
first
volume
of
his
text
book
and
forgot
that
he
had
a
son
where
both
parents
are
not
interested
in
these
little
affairs
something
is
sure
to
be
forgotten
cyril
mother
was
weak
and
ill
at
the
time
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
the
anger
of
the
fairy
who
was
invited
was
visited
on
the
baby
cyril
in
his
cradle
in
the
revengeful
spirit
of
that
fairy
who
is
omitted
from
these
functions
she
sent
a
threat
instead
of
a
blessing
and
decreed
that
cyril
should
walk
in
fear
all
the
days
of
his
life
of
course
being
a
fairy
she
knew
very
well
that
if
cyril
or
anybody
very
much
interested
in
cyril
went
to
declare
that
there
was
no
power
whatever
behind
her
curse
she
would
not
be
able
to
gratify
her
spite
but
she
knew
also
being
a
fairy
that
if
cyril
got
into
the
habit
of
believing
himself
a
coward
he
would
end
by
being
one
so
she
stood
a
good
chance
of
winning
after
all
cyril
when
he
came
into
the
world
had
come
with
only
half
a
welcome
no
mother
and
father
ever
met
over
his
cradle
and
looked
at
him
together
wondering
if
it
were
well
with
the
child
when
he
was
old
enough
to
have
his
hair
curled
and
a
sash
tied
around
his
baby
waist
he
was
sometimes
taken
downstairs
but
he
always
fled
to
his
mother
or
his
nurse
knee
when
his
father
approached
how
many
times
he
and
his
little
sister
olive
had
hidden
under
the
stairs
when
father
had
called
mother
down
to
the
study
to
scold
her
about
the
bill
and
there
was
a
nightmare
of
a
memory
concerning
a
certain
birthday
of
father
when
mother
had
determined
to
be
gay
it
was
just
before
supper
cyril
clad
in
his
first
brief
trousers
was
to
knock
at
the
study
door
with
a
little
purple
nosegay
in
his
hand
to
show
his
father
that
the
lilac
had
bloomed
olive
in
crimson
cashmere
was
to
stand
near
and
when
the
door
opened
present
him
with
her
own
picture
of
the
cat
and
her
new
kittens
while
mother
looking
so
pretty
with
her
own
gift
all
ready
in
her
hand
was
palpitating
on
the
staircase
to
see
how
the
plans
would
work
nothing
could
have
been
worse
however
in
the
way
of
a
small
domestic
tragedy
than
the
event
itself
when
it
finally
came
off
cyril
knocked
what
do
you
want
came
from
within
in
tones
that
breathed
vexation
at
being
interrupted
knock
again
whispered
lord
father
does
remember
that
his
birthday
and
he
does
know
that
it
you
knocking
cyril
knocked
again
timidly
but
at
the
first
sound
of
his
irritable
voice
as
he
rose
hurriedly
from
his
desk
the
boy
turned
and
fled
through
the
kitchen
to
the
shed
olive
held
the
fort
picture
in
hand
it
your
birthday
father
she
said
there
a
cake
for
supper
and
here
my
present
there
was
no
love
in
the
child
voice
her
heart
filled
with
passionate
sympathy
for
cyril
had
lost
all
zest
for
its
task
and
she
handed
her
gift
to
her
father
with
tightly
closed
lips
and
heaving
breast
all
right
i
much
obliged
but
i
wish
you
would
not
knock
at
this
door
when
i
am
writing
i
told
you
that
before
tell
your
mother
i
ca
come
to
supper
but
to
send
me
a
tray
please
as
he
closed
the
door
olive
saw
him
lay
the
picture
on
a
table
never
looking
at
it
as
he
crossed
the
room
to
one
of
the
great
that
lined
the
walls
lord
had
by
this
time
disappeared
forlornly
from
the
upper
hall
olive
aged
ten
walked
up
the
stairs
in
a
state
of
mind
ferocious
in
its
anger
entering
her
mother
room
she
tore
the
crimson
ribbon
from
her
hair
and
began
to
unbutton
her
dress
i
hate
him
i
him
she
cried
stamping
her
foot
i
will
never
knock
at
his
door
again
like
to
take
cyril
and
run
away
i
get
the
birthday
cake
and
fling
it
into
the
pond
nothing
shall
stop
me
then
seeing
her
mother
white
face
she
wailed
as
she
flung
herself
on
the
bed
oh
mother
mother
why
did
you
ever
let
him
come
to
live
with
us
did
we
to
have
him
for
a
father
could
you
it
mother
lord
grew
paler
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
wavered
caught
herself
wavered
again
and
fell
into
the
great
chair
by
the
window
her
eyes
closed
and
olive
frightened
by
the
apparent
effect
of
her
words
ran
down
the
back
stairs
and
summoned
the
cook
when
she
returned
panting
and
breathless
her
mother
was
sitting
quite
quietly
by
the
window
looking
out
at
the
cedars
it
was
only
a
sudden
pain
dear
i
am
all
well
again
nothing
is
really
the
matter
bridget
lord
will
not
be
down
to
supper
spread
a
tray
for
him
please
i
like
to
spread
a
tray
for
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
red
sea
where
he
belongs
muttered
bridget
as
she
descended
to
the
kitchen
to
comfort
cyril
was
it
my
fault
mother
asked
olive
bending
over
her
anxiously
her
mother
drew
the
child
head
down
and
leaned
her
own
against
it
feebly
no
dear
she
sighed
it
nobody
fault
unless
it
mine
is
the
pain
gone
quite
gone
dear
nevertheless
the
pain
was
to
prove
the
final
wrench
to
a
heart
that
had
been
on
the
verge
of
breaking
for
many
a
year
and
it
was
not
long
before
olive
and
cyril
were
motherless
lord
did
not
have
the
slightest
objection
to
the
growing
intimacy
between
his
children
and
the
new
family
in
the
yellow
house
so
long
as
he
was
not
disturbed
by
it
and
so
long
as
it
cost
him
nothing
they
had
strict
orders
not
to
play
with
certain
of
their
village
acquaintances
lord
believing
himself
to
be
an
aristocrat
the
fact
being
that
he
was
almost
destitute
of
human
sympathy
and
to
make
a
neighbor
of
him
you
would
have
had
to
begin
with
his
grandfather
and
work
for
three
generations
he
had
seen
nancy
and
gilbert
at
the
gates
of
his
place
and
he
had
passed
carey
in
one
of
his
infrequent
walks
to
the
she
was
not
a
person
to
pass
without
mental
comment
and
lord
instantly
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
an
equal
an
unusual
fact
in
his
experience
he
would
not
have
known
a
superior
if
he
had
met
one
ever
so
often
a
very
fine
unusual
woman
he
thought
she
accounts
for
that
handsome
manly
boy
i
wish
he
could
knock
some
spirit
into
cyril
the
process
of
knocking
spirit
into
a
boy
would
seem
to
be
inconsistent
with
educational
logic
but
by
very
different
methods
gilbert
had
certainly
given
cyril
a
trifling
belief
in
himself
and
mother
carey
was
gradually
winning
him
to
some
sort
of
by
the
warmth
of
her
frequent
welcomes
and
the
delightful
faculty
she
possessed
of
making
him
feel
at
ease
come
come
said
the
petrels
to
the
in
water
babies
this
young
gentleman
is
going
to
shiny
wall
he
is
a
plucky
one
to
have
gone
so
far
give
the
little
chap
a
cast
over
the
for
mother
carey
sake
gilbert
was
delighted
in
a
new
place
to
find
a
boy
friend
of
his
own
age
and
cyril
speedy
attachment
gratified
his
pride
gilbert
was
doing
well
these
summer
months
the
unceasing
activity
the
authority
given
him
by
his
mother
and
sisters
his
growing
proficiency
in
all
kinds
of
skilled
labor
as
he
puttered
about
with
osh
popham
or
bill
harmon
in
house
and
barn
and
garden
all
this
pleased
his
enterprising
nature
only
one
anxiety
troubled
his
mother
his
unresigned
and
mutinous
attitude
about
exchanging
popular
and
fashionable
eastover
for
beulah
academy
which
seat
of
learning
he
regarded
with
unutterable
scorn
he
knew
that
there
was
apparently
no
money
to
pay
eastover
fees
but
he
was
still
child
enough
to
feel
that
it
could
be
found
somewhere
if
properly
searched
for
he
even
considered
the
education
of
captain
carey
eldest
son
an
emergency
vital
enough
to
make
it
proper
to
dip
into
the
precious
five
thousand
dollars
which
was
yielding
them
a
part
of
their
slender
annual
income
once
when
gilbert
was
a
little
boy
he
had
put
his
shoulder
out
of
joint
and
to
save
time
his
mother
took
him
at
once
to
the
doctor
he
was
suffering
but
still
strong
enough
to
walk
they
had
to
climb
a
hilly
street
the
child
moaning
with
pain
his
mother
soothing
and
encouraging
him
as
they
went
on
suddenly
he
whimpered
oh
if
this
had
only
happened
to
ellen
or
joanna
or
addy
or
nancy
i
could
have
borne
it
much
better
there
was
a
good
deal
of
that
small
boy
left
in
gilbert
still
and
he
endured
best
the
economies
that
fell
on
the
feminine
members
of
the
family
it
was
the
very
end
of
august
and
although
school
opened
the
first
monday
in
september
carey
was
not
certain
whether
gilbert
would
walk
into
the
white
painted
academy
with
the
despised
beulah
hayseeds
or
whether
he
would
make
a
scene
and
authority
would
have
to
be
used
i
declare
gilly
exclaimed
mother
carey
one
night
after
an
argument
on
the
subject
one
would
imagine
the
only
course
in
life
open
to
a
boy
was
to
prepare
at
eastover
and
go
to
college
afterwards
yet
you
may
take
a
list
of
the
most
famous
men
in
america
and
i
dare
say
you
will
find
half
of
them
came
from
schools
like
beulah
academy
or
infinitely
poorer
ones
i
do
mean
the
millionaires
alone
i
mean
the
merchants
and
engineers
and
surgeons
and
poets
and
authors
and
statesmen
go
ahead
and
try
to
stamp
your
school
in
some
way
gilly
do
sit
down
feebly
and
wait
for
it
to
stamp
you
this
was
all
very
well
as
an
exhibition
of
spirit
on
mother
part
but
it
had
been
a
very
hard
week
gilbert
was
sulky
peter
had
had
a
touch
of
tonsillitis
nancy
was
faltering
at
the
dishwashing
and
wishing
she
were
a
boy
julia
was
a
perfect
barnacle
kathleen
had
an
aching
tooth
and
there
being
no
dentist
in
the
village
was
applying
popham
remedies
roasted
raisins
and
disfiguring
bread
poultices
bill
harmon
had
received
no
reply
from
hamilton
and
when
mother
carey
went
to
her
room
that
evening
she
felt
conscious
of
a
lassitude
and
a
sense
of
anxiety
deeper
than
for
months
as
gilbert
went
by
to
his
own
room
he
glanced
in
at
her
door
finding
it
slightly
ajar
she
sat
before
her
dressing
table
her
long
hair
flowing
over
her
shoulders
her
head
bent
over
her
two
hands
his
father
picture
was
in
its
accustomed
place
and
he
heard
her
say
as
she
looked
at
it
oh
my
dear
my
dear
i
am
so
careworn
so
troubled
so
discouraged
gilbert
needs
you
and
so
do
i
more
than
tongue
can
tell
the
voice
was
so
low
that
it
was
almost
a
whisper
but
it
reached
gilbert
ears
and
there
was
a
sob
strangled
in
it
that
touched
his
heart
the
boy
tiptoed
softly
into
his
room
and
sat
down
on
his
bed
in
the
moonlight
dear
old
mater
he
thought
it
no
go
i
got
to
give
up
eastover
and
college
and
all
and
settle
down
into
a
country
bumpkin
no
fellow
could
see
his
mother
look
like
that
and
speak
like
that
and
go
his
own
gait
he
just
got
to
go
hers
meantime
carey
had
put
out
the
lamp
and
lay
quietly
thinking
the
last
words
that
floated
through
her
mind
as
she
sank
to
sleep
were
those
of
a
verse
learned
she
could
not
say
how
many
years
before
you
can
glad
your
child
or
grieve
it
you
can
trust
it
or
deceive
it
when
all
done
beneath
god
sun
you
can
only
love
and
leave
it
xxiii
nearing
shiny
wall
another
person
presumably
on
the
way
to
shiny
wall
and
peacepool
but
putting
small
energy
into
the
journey
was
that
mass
of
positively
glaring
virtues
julia
carey
more
than
one
fairy
must
have
been
forgotten
when
julia
christening
party
came
off
no
talk
in
the
twilight
had
thus
far
produced
any
obvious
effect
she
had
never
even
when
very
young
experienced
a
desire
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
superior
wisdom
always
greatly
preferring
a
chair
of
her
own
she
seldom
did
wrong
in
her
own
opinion
because
the
moment
she
entertained
an
idea
it
at
once
became
right
her
vanity
serving
as
a
pair
of
blinders
to
keep
her
from
seeing
the
truth
the
doctors
did
not
permit
any
one
to
write
to
poor
allan
carey
so
that
julia
heart
could
not
be
softened
by
continual
communication
with
her
invalid
father
who
with
gladys
ferguson
constituted
the
only
tribunal
she
was
willing
to
recognize
her
consciousness
of
superiority
to
the
conditions
that
surrounded
her
her
love
of
luxury
the
silken
selfishness
with
which
she
squirmed
out
of
unpleasant
duties
these
made
her
an
unlikable
and
undesirable
housemate
and
that
these
faults
could
exist
with
what
nancy
called
her
everlasting
attitude
made
it
difficult
for
mother
carey
to
maintain
a
harmonious
family
circle
it
was
an
outburst
of
nancy
impetuous
temper
that
carey
had
always
secretly
dreaded
but
after
all
it
was
poor
kathleen
who
precipitated
an
unforgettable
scene
which
left
an
influence
behind
it
for
many
months
the
morning
after
mother
carey
interview
with
gilbert
she
looked
up
as
her
door
was
pushed
open
and
beheld
julia
white
and
rigid
with
temper
standing
on
the
threshold
what
is
the
matter
child
exclaimed
her
aunt
laying
down
her
work
in
alarm
close
behind
julia
came
kathleen
her
face
swollen
with
tears
her
expression
full
of
unutterable
woe
julia
lips
opened
almost
automatically
as
she
said
slowly
and
with
bitter
emphasis
aunt
margaret
is
it
true
as
kathleen
says
that
my
father
has
all
your
money
and
some
of
uncle
peter
something
snapped
in
mother
carey
one
glance
at
kathleen
showed
only
too
well
that
she
had
committed
the
almost
unpardonable
sin
of
telling
julia
what
had
been
carefully
and
tenderly
kept
from
her
before
she
could
answer
kathleen
had
swept
past
julia
and
flung
herself
on
the
floor
near
her
mother
oh
mother
i
ca
say
anything
that
will
ever
make
you
understand
julia
knows
she
knows
in
her
heart
what
she
said
that
provoked
me
she
does
nothing
but
grumble
about
the
work
and
how
few
dresses
we
have
and
what
a
drudge
she
is
and
what
common
neighbors
we
have
and
how
miss
tewksbury
would
pity
her
if
she
knew
all
and
how
uncle
allan
would
suffer
if
he
could
see
his
daughter
living
such
a
life
and
this
morning
my
head
ached
and
my
tooth
ached
and
i
was
cross
and
all
at
once
something
leaped
out
of
my
mouth
tell
her
what
you
said
urged
julia
inexorably
sobs
choked
kathleen
voice
i
said
i
said
oh
how
can
i
tell
it
i
said
if
her
father
had
lost
so
much
of
my
father
and
my
money
we
should
have
been
so
poor
any
of
us
kathleen
how
could
you
cried
her
mother
if
julia
wished
to
precipitate
a
tempest
she
had
succeeded
and
her
face
showed
a
certain
sedate
triumph
oh
mother
do
give
me
up
do
give
me
up
wailed
kathleen
it
was
me
that
said
it
it
was
somebody
else
that
i
did
know
lived
inside
of
me
i
do
expect
you
to
forgive
it
or
forget
it
julia
but
if
you
only
try
just
a
little
bit
i
show
you
how
sorry
i
feel
i
cut
myself
and
make
it
bleed
i
go
to
prison
if
i
could
get
back
to
where
i
was
before
i
said
it
oh
what
shall
i
do
mother
if
you
look
at
me
like
that
again
or
say
could
you
there
was
no
doubting
kathleen
remorse
even
julia
saw
that
did
she
tell
the
truth
aunt
margaret
she
repeated
come
here
julia
and
sit
by
me
it
is
true
that
your
uncle
peter
and
i
have
both
put
money
into
your
father
business
and
it
is
true
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
give
it
back
to
us
and
perhaps
may
never
do
so
there
is
just
enough
left
to
pay
your
poor
father
living
expenses
but
we
trust
his
honor
we
are
as
sorry
for
him
as
we
can
be
and
we
love
him
dearly
kathleen
meant
nothing
but
that
your
father
has
been
unfortunate
and
we
all
have
to
abide
by
the
consequences
but
i
am
amazed
that
my
daughter
should
have
so
forgotten
herself
as
to
speak
of
it
to
you
renewed
sobs
from
the
prostrate
kathleen
especially
said
julia
when
as
gladys
ferguson
says
i
anybody
in
the
world
but
you
to
turn
to
in
my
trouble
i
am
a
fatherless
girl
her
voice
quivered
here
and
i
am
a
guest
in
your
house
carey
blood
rose
a
little
as
she
looked
at
poor
kitty
shaken
body
and
streaming
eyes
and
julia
unforgiving
face
you
are
wrong
there
julia
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
not
take
your
full
share
of
our
misfortunes
and
suffer
as
much
as
we
from
our
too
small
income
it
is
not
our
fault
it
is
not
yours
you
are
not
a
privileged
guest
you
are
one
of
the
family
if
you
are
fatherless
just
now
my
children
are
fatherless
forever
yet
you
have
not
made
one
single
burden
lighter
by
joining
our
forces
you
have
been
an
outsider
instead
of
putting
yourself
loyally
into
the
breach
and
working
with
us
heart
to
heart
i
welcomed
you
with
open
arms
and
you
have
made
my
life
harder
much
harder
than
it
was
before
your
coming
to
protect
you
i
have
had
to
discipline
my
own
children
continually
and
all
the
time
you
were
putting
their
tempers
to
quite
unnecessary
tests
i
am
not
extenuating
kathleen
but
i
merely
say
you
have
no
right
to
behave
as
you
do
you
are
thirteen
years
old
quite
old
enough
to
make
up
your
mind
whether
you
wish
to
be
loved
by
anybody
or
not
at
present
you
are
not
never
had
the
ears
of
the
paragon
heard
such
disagreeably
plain
speech
she
was
not
inclined
to
tears
but
moisture
began
to
appear
in
her
eyes
and
she
looked
as
though
a
shower
were
imminent
aunt
margaret
was
magnificent
in
her
wrath
and
though
julia
feared
she
admired
her
not
to
be
loved
if
that
really
were
to
be
her
lot
rather
terrified
julia
she
secretly
envied
nancy
unconscious
gift
of
drawing
people
to
her
instantly
men
women
children
dogs
and
horses
for
that
matter
she
never
noticed
that
nancy
heart
ran
out
to
meet
everybody
and
that
she
was
overflowing
with
vitality
and
joy
and
sympathy
on
the
contrary
she
considered
the
tribute
of
affection
paid
to
nancy
as
a
part
of
luck
virtuous
conscientious
intelligent
and
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
she
emphatically
did
not
wish
to
be
disliked
and
it
was
a
complete
surprise
to
her
that
she
had
not
been
a
successful
carey
chicken
gladys
ferguson
always
loved
me
she
expostulated
after
a
brief
silence
and
there
was
a
quiver
in
her
voice
then
either
gladys
has
a
remarkable
gift
of
loving
or
else
you
are
a
different
julia
in
her
company
remarked
mother
carey
quietly
raising
julia
astonishment
and
perturbation
to
an
immeasurable
height
now
kathleen
continued
mother
carey
godfrey
has
often
asked
you
to
spend
a
week
with
elsie
and
you
can
go
to
charlestown
on
the
afternoon
train
go
away
from
julia
and
forget
everything
but
that
you
have
done
wrong
and
you
must
find
a
way
to
repair
it
i
hope
julia
will
learn
while
you
are
away
to
make
it
easier
for
you
to
be
courteous
and
amiable
there
is
a
good
deal
in
the
bible
julia
about
the
sin
of
causing
your
brother
to
offend
between
that
sin
and
kathleen
offence
there
is
little
in
my
mind
to
choose
yes
there
is
cried
kathleen
i
am
much
much
worse
than
julia
father
could
bear
to
know
that
i
had
hurt
julia
feelings
and
hurt
yours
too
i
was
false
to
father
and
you
and
uncle
allan
and
julia
nothing
can
be
said
for
me
i
am
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
shall
never
get
over
it
in
the
world
oh
julia
could
you
shake
hands
with
me
just
to
show
me
you
know
how
i
despise
myself
julia
shook
hands
considerably
less
like
a
slug
or
a
limpet
than
usual
and
something
very
queer
and
unexpected
happened
when
her
hand
met
poor
kitty
wet
feverish
little
paw
and
she
heard
the
quiver
in
her
voice
she
suddenly
stooped
and
kissed
her
cousin
quite
without
intention
kathleen
returned
the
salute
with
grateful
pathetic
warmth
and
then
the
two
fell
on
mother
carey
neck
to
be
kissed
and
cried
over
for
a
full
minute
i
go
to
the
doctor
and
have
my
ugly
tooth
pulled
out
exclaimed
kathleen
wiping
her
eyes
if
it
had
been
for
that
i
never
could
have
been
so
horrible
that
would
be
all
very
well
for
once
answered
her
mother
with
a
tired
smile
but
if
you
pluck
out
a
supposed
offending
member
every
time
you
do
something
wrong
i
fear
you
will
not
have
many
left
when
you
are
an
old
lady
mother
said
kathleen
almost
under
her
breath
and
not
daring
to
look
up
could
i
stay
at
home
from
charlestown
and
show
you
and
julia
here
how
sorry
i
am
yes
let
her
aunt
margaret
and
then
i
can
have
a
chance
to
try
too
pleaded
julia
had
the
heavens
fallen
had
the
paragon
the
pink
of
propriety
and
perfection
confessed
a
fault
had
the
heart
of
the
smug
one
the
prig
melted
and
did
she
feel
at
last
her
kinship
to
the
carey
chickens
had
she
suffered
a
real
grievance
the
first
amongst
numberless
deeds
of
tenderness
and
having
resented
it
like
an
old
beast
forgiven
it
like
a
new
one
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
mother
carey
that
week
were
at
her
old
trade
of
making
things
make
themselves
gilbert
kathleen
and
julia
had
all
fought
their
way
under
the
and
were
getting
a
glimpse
of
shiny
wall

a
letter
prom
germany
mother
carey
walked
down
the
village
street
one
morning
late
in
august
while
peter
milk
pail
in
hand
was
running
by
her
side
and
making
frequent
excursions
off
the
main
line
of
travel
beulah
looked
enchanting
after
a
night
of
rain
and
the
fields
were
greener
than
they
had
been
since
haying
time
unless
hamilton
were
away
from
his
consular
post
on
a
vacation
somewhere
on
the
continent
he
should
have
received
and
answered
bill
harmon
letter
before
this
she
was
thinking
as
she
looked
at
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
scene
that
had
so
endeared
itself
to
her
in
a
few
short
months
popham
had
finished
her
morning
work
and
was
already
sitting
at
her
frame
in
the
open
doorway
making
a
very
purple
rose
with
a
very
scarlet
centre
will
you
come
inside
mis
carey
she
asked
hospitably
or
do
you
want
lallie
joy
to
set
you
a
chair
on
the
grass
same
as
you
had
last
time
i
always
prefer
the
grass
popham
smiled
carey
as
the
day
for
the
fishman
to
come
i
thought
we
like
an
extra
quart
of
milk
for
chowder
i
only
hope
he
make
to
come
was
popham
curt
response
if
i
set
out
to
a
fishman
i
vow
i
one
tubbs
stays
to
home
whenever
he
hayin
or
his
wife
sick
or
it
stormy
or
the
children
want
to
go
to
the
circus
carey
laughed
that
true
but
as
your
husband
reminded
me
last
week
when
tubbs
disappointed
us
his
fish
is
always
and
good
oh
of
course
popham
would
speak
up
for
him
returned
his
wife
i
do
see
myself
as
it
makes
much
whether
his
fish
is
good
or
bad
if
he
stays
to
home
with
it
mebbe
i
look
on
the
dark
side
a
little
mite
i
ca
hardly
help
it
livin
with
popham
and
he
so
hopeful
he
keeps
us
all
very
merry
at
the
yellow
house
carey
ventured
yes
he
would
remarked
popham
drily
but
you
do
git
it
stiddy
hopefulness
at
meals
hopefulness
evenin
an
hopefulness
nights
one
everlastin
stiddy
stream
of
hopefulness
he
was
jest
so
as
a
boy
always
lookin
on
the
bright
side
whether
there
was
any
or
not
his
mother
father
got
turrible
sick
of
it
so
much
sunshine
in
the
house
made
a
continual
drouth
so
old
mis
popham
used
to
say
for
her
part
she
said
she
liked
to
think
that
once
in
a
while
there
was
a
cloud
that
was
a
cloud
a
thick
black
cloud
clean
through
to
the
back
she
was
tired
to
death
lookin
for
ossian
silver
linin
lallie
joy
real
moody
like
me
i
it
only
natural
livin
with
a
father
who
never
sees
anything
but
good
no
matter
which
way
he
looks
there

things
i
trust

any
more
when

so
we
have
it
back
an
forth

a
wonderful
faculty
seeing
the
good

everything

carey
wonderful
tiresome
returned
popham
though
i
will
own
up
ossian
only
fault
and
he
ca
see
his
own
misfortunes
any
clearer
than
he
can
see
those
of
other
folks
his
new
colt
run
away
with
him
last
week
and
stove
the
mowin
machine

maria

out

barn
now
fussin
over
it
you
can
hear

singin
they

all
here
practicin
for
the
methodist
concert
last
night
an
i
sleep
a
wink
the
tunes
kep
in
my
head
so
they
always
git
ossian
to
sing
like
a
youthful
hart
or
roe
over
the
hills
where
spices
grow
an
i
tell
him
he
too
old
youthful
harts
an
roes

over
the
hills
wearin
spectacles

tell
him
but
he
go
right
on
singin
it
till
they
have
to
carry
him
up
on
the
platform
in
a
wheeled
chair
you
go
to
the
congregational
church
do
you
mrs
popham
asked
carey
i
seen
lallie
and
digby
at
yes
popham
is
a
methodist
and
i
a
congregationalist
but
i
say
let
the
children
go
where
they
like
so
i
always
take
them
with
me
carey
was
just
struggling
to
conceal
her
amusement
at
this
religious
flexibility
on
popham
part
when
she
espied
nancy
flying
down
the
street
bareheaded
waving
a
bit
of
paper
in
the
air
are
you
ready
to
come
home
muddy
she
called
without
coming
any
nearer
yes
quite
ready
now
lallie
has
brought
the
milk
good
morning
popham
the
children
want
me
for
some
new
enterprise
you
give
yourself
most
too
much
to
expostulated
popham
you
do
take
no
vacations
ah
well
you
see
is
all
i
have
to
give
them
answered
carey
taking
peter
and
going
to
meet
nancy
mother
said
that
young
person
breathlessly
i
must
tell
you
what
i
did
tell
at
the
time
for
fear
of
troubling
you
i
wrote
to
hamilton
by
the
same
post
that
harmon
did
bill
is
so
busy
and
such
a
poor
writer
i
thought
he
would
put
the
matter
nicely
at
all
and
i
did
want
you
with
all
your
worries
brought
into
it
so
i
wrote
to
the
consul
myself
and
kept
a
copy
to
show
you
exactly
what
i
said
i
have
been
waiting
at
the
gate
for
the
letters
every
day
for
a
week
but
this
morning
gilbert
happened
to
be
there
and
shouted
letter
from
germany
for
you
nancy
so
all
of
them
are
wild
with
curiosity
olive
and
cyril
too
but
i
wanted
you
to
open
and
read
it
first
because
it
may
be
full
of
awful
blows
carey
sat
down
on
the
side
of
a
green
bank
between
the
corner
and
the
yellow
house
and
opened
the
letter
with
some
misgivings
it
must
be
confessed
nancy
sat
close
beside
her
and
held
one
edge
of
the
wide
sheets
closely
filled
why
he
has
written
you
a
volume
nancy
exclaimed
carey
it
must
be
the
complete
story
of
his
life
how
long
was
yours
to
him
i
do
remember
pretty
long
because
there
seemed
to
be
so
much
to
tell
to
show
him
how
we
loved
the
house
and
why
we
could
spend
cousin
ann
money
and
move
out
in
a
year
or
two
and
a
lot
about
ourselves
to
let
him
see
we
were
nice
and
agreeable
and
respectable
i
not
sure
all
that
was
strictly
necessary
commented
carey
with
some
trepidation
this
was
lemuel
hamilton
letter
dated
from
the
office
of
the
american
consul
in
breslau
germany
my
dear
miss
nancy
as
your
letter
to
me
was
a
purely
business
communication
i
suppose
i
ought
to
begin
my
reply
dear
madam
your
esteemed
favor
was
received
on
the
sixth
inst
and
contents
noted
but
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
think
you
must
have
guessed
that
i
have
two
girls
of
my
own
for
you
wrote
to
me
just
as
if
we
were
sitting
together
side
by
side
like
two
friends
not
a
bit
as
landlord
and
tenant
mother
carey
eyes
twinkled
she
well
knew
nancy
informal
epistolary
style
and
her
facile
instantaneous
friendliness
every
word
in
your
letter
interested
me
pleased
me
touched
me
i
feel
that
i
know
you
all
from
the
dear
mother
who
sits
in
the
centre
what
does
he
mean
by
that
i
sent
him
a
snap
shot
of
the
family
what
for
so
that
he
could
see
what
we
were
like
so
that
he
know
we
were
fit
to
be
lifelong
tenants
carey
turned
resignedly
to
the
letter
again
from
the
dear
mother
who
sits
in
the
centre
to
the
lovable
little
peter
who
looks
as
if
he
were
all
that
you
describe
him
i
was
about
his
age
when
i
went
to
the
yellow
house
to
spend
a
few
years
old
granny
hamilton
had
lived
there
all
her
life
and
when
my
mother
who
was
a
widow
was
seized
with
a
serious
illness
she
took
me
home
with
her
for
a
long
visit
she
was
never
well
enough
to
go
away
so
my
early
childhood
was
passed
in
beulah
and
i
only
left
the
village
when
i
was
ten
years
old
and
an
orphan
oh
dear
interpolated
nancy
it
seems
lately
as
if
nobody
had
both
father
and
mother
granny
hamilton
died
soon
after
my
mother
and
i
hardly
know
who
lived
in
the
house
for
the
next
thirty
years
it
was
my
brother
property
and
a
succession
of
families
occupied
it
until
it
fell
to
me
in
my
turn
i
have
no
happy
memories
connected
with
it
so
you
can
go
ahead
and
make
them
for
yourselves
my
only
remembrance
is
of
the
west
bedroom
where
my
mother
lived
and
died
the
west
bedroom
that
is
the
painted
one
no
of
course
it
is
the
one
where
i
sleep
said
carey
the
painted
one
must
always
have
been
the
guest
chamber
she
could
only
move
from
bed
to
chair
and
her
greatest
pleasure
was
to
sit
by
the
sunset
window
and
look
at
the
daisies
and
buttercups
waving
in
that
beautiful
sloping
stretch
of
field
with
the
pine
woods
beyond
after
the
grass
was
mown
and
that
field
was
always
left
till
the
last
for
her
sake
she
used
to
sit
there
and
wait
for
queen
anne
lace
to
come
up
its
tall
stems
and
delicate
white
wheels
nodding
among
the
grasses
oh
i
do
him
exclaimed
nancy
impetuously
ca
you
him
mother
it
so
nice
of
him
to
remember
that
they
always
mowed
the
hayfield
last
for
his
mother
sake
and
so
nice
of
him
to
think
of
queen
anne
lace
all
these
years
now
as
to
business
your
cousin
ann
is
quite
right
when
she
tells
you
that
you
ought
not
to
put
expensive
improvements
on
another
person
property
lest
you
be
disturbed
in
your
tenancy
that
sort
of
cousin
is
always
right
whatever
she
says
mine
was
not
named
ann
she
was
emma
but
the
principle
is
the
same
nancy
asked
carey
looking
away
from
the
letter
again
did
you
say
anything
about
your
cousin
ann
yes
some
little
thing
or
other
for
it
was
her
money
that
we
spend
until
we
knew
we
could
stay
in
the
house
i
did
describe
her
of
course
to
hamilton
i
just
told
him
she
was
very
businesslike
and
yes
i
remember
now
i
told
him
you
said
she
was
a
very
fine
person
that
about
all
but
you
see
how
clever
he
is
he
just
has
as
popham
says
and
you
do
have
to
tell
him
much
about
anything
if
you
are
intending
to
bring
the
water
from
the
well
into
the
house
and
put
a
large
stove
in
the
cellar
to
warm
some
of
the
upper
rooms
if
you
are
papering
and
painting
inside
and
keeping
the
place
in
good
condition
you
are
preserving
my
property
and
even
adding
to
its
value
so
under
the
circumstances
i
could
not
think
of
accepting
any
rent
in
money
no
rent
not
even
the
sixty
dollars
exclaimed
nancy
look
that
is
precisely
what
he
says
there
never
was
such
a
dear
since
the
world
began
cried
nancy
joyously
oh
do
read
on
there
a
lot
more
and
the
last
may
contradict
the
first
shall
i
tell
you
what
more
the
careys
may
do
for
me
they
who
have
done
so
much
already
so
much
quoted
nancy
with
dramatic
emphasis
oh
he
a
dear
my
son
tom
when
he
went
down
to
beulah
before
starting
for
china
visited
the
house
and
at
my
request
put
away
my
mother
picture
safely
he
is
a
clever
boy
and
instead
of
placing
the
thing
in
an
attic
where
it
might
be
injured
he
tucked
it
away
where
do
you
think
in
the
old
brick
oven
of
the
room
that
is
now
i
suppose
your
dining
room
it
is
a
capital
for
there
had
been
no
fire
there
for
fifty
years
nor
ever
will
be
again
i
have
other
portraits
of
her
with
me
on
this
side
of
the
water
please
remove
the
one
i
speak
of
from
its
wrappings
and
hang
it
over
the
mantel
shelf
in
the
west
bedroom
my
bedroom
i
shall
love
to
have
it
there
said
mother
carey
then
once
a
year
on
my
mother
birthday
it
is
the
fourth
of
july
and
an
easy
date
to
remember
will
my
little
friend
miss
nancy
or
any
of
the
other
careys
if
she
is
absent
pick
a
little
nosegay
of
daisies
and
buttercups
perhaps
there
will
even
be
a
bit
of
early
queen
anne
lace
and
put
it
in
a
vase
under
my
mother
picture
that
shall
be
the
annual
rent
paid
for
the
yellow
house
to
lemuel
hamilton
by
the
careys
tears
of
joy
sprang
to
the
eyes
of
emotional
nancy
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
paced
the
greensward
excitedly
oh
mother
i
did
think
there
could
be
another
such
man
after
knowing
father
and
the
admiral
is
it
all
as
wonderful
as
a
fairy
story
there
a
little
more
listen
dear
as
to
the
term
of
your
occupancy
the
careys
may
have
the
yellow
house
until
the
day
of
my
death
unless
by
some
extraordinary
chance
my
son
tom
should
ever
want
it
as
a
summer
home
oh
dear
there
comes
the
dreadful
son
tom
is
our
only
enemy
then
said
nancy
darkly
he
is
in
china
at
all
events
her
mother
remarked
cheerfully
tom
is
the
only
one
who
ever
had
a
bit
of
sentiment
about
beulah
and
he
was
always
unwilling
that
the
old
place
should
be
occupied
by
strangers
the
curious
thing
about
the
matter
is
that
you
and
yours
do
not
seem
to
be
strangers
to
me
and
mine
do
you
know
dear
little
miss
nancy
what
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
in
your
letter
the
incident
of
your
asking
what
you
could
do
to
thank
the
yellow
house
for
the
happy
hour
it
had
given
you
on
that
summer
day
long
ago
and
the
planting
of
the
crimson
rambler
by
the
side
of
the
portico
i
have
sent
your
picture
tying
up
the
rose
and
it
was
so
charming
i
was
loath
to
let
it
go
with
your
letter
and
the
snap
shot
of
the
family
group
all
out
to
my
son
tom
in
china
he
will
know
then
why
i
have
let
the
house
to
whom
and
all
the
attendant
circumstances
trust
him
never
to
disturb
you
when
he
sees
how
you
love
the
old
place
the
planting
of
that
crimson
rambler
will
fix
tom
for
he
a
romantic
boy
the
planting
of
the
rose
was
a
heavenly
inspiration
if
it
does
tom
we
call
tom
the
chinese
enemy
no
we
call
him
the
yellow
peril
laughed
nancy
in
triumph
i
am
delighted
with
the
sample
of
paper
you
have
chosen
for
the
front
hall
i
do
see
why
you
did
go
over
to
germany
yourself
nancy
and
take
a
trunk
of
samples
cried
carey
wiping
the
tears
of
merriment
from
her
eyes
i
ca
think
what
the
postage
on
your
letter
must
have
been
ten
cents
nancy
confessed
but
was
it
worth
it
muddy
come
read
the
last
few
lines
and
then
we
run
all
the
way
home
to
tell
the
others
send
me
anything
more
at
any
time
to
give
me
an
idea
of
the
delightful
things
you
are
doing
i
shall
be
proud
if
you
honor
me
with
an
occasional
letter
pray
give
my
regards
to
your
mother
whom
i
envy
and
all
the
stormy
petrels
whom
i
envy
too
believe
me
dear
miss
nancy
yours
sincerely
lemuel
hamilton
i
ca
remember
why
i
told
him
about
mother
carey
chickens
said
nancy
reflectively
it
just
seemed
to
come
in
naturally
the
yellow
peril
must
be
rather
nice
as
well
as
his
father
even
if
he
is
our
enemy
that
was
clever
of
him
putting
his
grandmother
in
the
brick
oven
and
here
nancy
laughed
and
laughed
again
thinking
how
her
last
remark
would
sound
if
overheard
by
a
person
unacquainted
with
the
circumstances
a
delightful
warm
kind
friendly
letter
said
mother
carey
folding
it
with
a
caressing
hand
i
wish
your
father
could
have
read
it
he
does
say
a
word
about
his
children
and
nancy
took
the
sheets
and
scanned
them
again
you
evidently
gave
him
the
history
of
your
whole
family
but
he
confines
himself
to
his
own
life
he
mentions
son
tom
frequently
enough
but
there
not
a
word
of
mrs
hamilton
no
but
there
no
reason
there
should
be
especially
if
he
loved
her
he
could
keep
her
out
said
nancy
shrewdly
she
just
is
in
the
story
at
all
could
any
of
us
write
a
chronicle
of
any
house
we
ever
lived
in
and
leave
you
out
carey
took
nancy
outstretched
hands
and
was
pulled
up
from
the
greensward
you
have
a
few
yourself
little
daughter
she
said
with
a
swift
pat
on
the
rosy
cheek
now
peter
put
your
marbles
in
the
pocket
of
your
blue
jeans
and
take
the
milk
pail
from
under
the
bushes
we
must
hurry
or
there
be
no
chowder
as
they
neared
garden
the
group
of
children
rushed
out
to
meet
them
kitty
in
advance
the
fish
man
did
come
she
said
and
it
long
past
his
time
so
there
no
hope
but
julia
and
i
have
the
dinner
all
planned
there
was
enough
of
it
to
go
round
anyway
so
we
asked
olive
and
cyril
to
stay
and
we
set
the
table
under
the
great
maple
do
you
care
not
a
bit
we
have
a
real
jollification
because
nancy
has
some
good
news
to
tell
you
the
dinner
is
quite
appropriate
for
a
jollification
kitty
observed
anxiously
is
the
news
good
enough
to
warrant
opening
a
jar
or
a
can
of
anything
open
all
that
doth
hap
to
be
closed
cried
nancy
embracing
olive
excitedly
light
the
bonfires
on
the
encroaching
hills
set
casks
and
so
forth
it
the
german
letter
said
gilbert
at
a
venture
what
is
the
dinner
kitty
mother
carey
asked
new
potatoes
and
string
beans
from
the
aft
garden
stale
bread
made
into
milk
toast
to
be
served
as
a
course
then
not
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case
but
just
to
give
a
style
to
the
meal
julia
has
made
a
salad
out
of
the
newspaper
nancy
created
a
diversion
by
swooning
on
the
grass
a
feat
which
had
given
her
great
fame
in
charades
it
was
only
the
memory
of
julia
last
newspaper
salad
she
murmured
when
the
usual
restoratives
had
been
applied
prithee
poppet
what
hast
dropped
into
the
dish
julia
was
laughing
too
much
to
be
wholly
intelligible
but
read
from
a
scrap
in
her
apron
pocket
fruit
in
season
cold
beans
or
peas
minced
cucumber
english
walnuts
a
few
cubes
of
cold
meat
left
from
dinner
hard
boiled
eggs
in
slices
flecks
of
ripe
tomatoes
and
radishes
to
perfect
the
color
scheme
a
dash
of
onion
juice
dash
of
paprika
dash
of
rich
cream
i
have
left
out
the
okra
the
shallot
the
estragon
the
tarragon
the
endive
the
hearts
of
artichoke
the
hungarian
peppers
and
the
haricot
beans
because
we
had
any
do
you
think
it
will
make
any
difference
aunt
margaret
it
will
said
nancy
oracularly
but
all
to
the
good
rather
a
dull
salad
i
call
it
commented
gilbert
lacks
the
snap
of
the
last
one
no
mention
of
boned
sprats
or
snails
in
aspic
foot
jelly
iced
humming
birds
pickled
edelweiss
or
any
of
those
things
kept
habitually
in
the
cellars
of
families
like
ours
no
dash
of
jamaica
ginger
or
or
sloe
gin
or
sarsaparilla
to
give
it
piquancy
unless
julia
can
find
a
paper
that
gives
more
advice
to
its
country
subscribers
we
have
to
transfer
her
from
the
kitchen
department
to
the
woodshed
julia
whole
attitude
during
this
discussion
of
her
recent
culinary
experiments
was
indicative
of
the
change
that
was
slowly
taking
place
in
her
point
of
view
the
careys
had
a
large
sense
of
humor
from
mother
down
as
far
as
peter
who
was
still
in
the
tadpole
stage
of
it
they
chaffed
one
another
on
all
occasions
for
the
most
part
courteously
and
with
entire
good
nature
leigh
hunt
speaks
of
the
anxiety
of
certain
persons
to
keep
their
minds
quiet
lest
any
motion
be
clumsy
and
concern
had
been
of
this
variety
but
four
or
five
months
spent
in
a
household
where
mental
operations
if
not
deep
were
incredibly
quick
had
made
her
a
little
more
elastic
mother
carey
had
always
said
that
if
julia
had
any
sense
of
humor
she
would
discover
for
herself
what
a
solemn
prig
she
was
and
mend
her
ways
and
it
seemed
as
if
this
might
be
true
in
course
of
time
what
we
do
with
all
the
milk
now
demanded
peter
who
had
carried
it
all
the
way
from
the
pophams
and
to
whom
it
appeared
therefore
of
exaggerated
importance
angel
boy
cried
nancy
embracing
him
the
only
practical
member
of
the
family
what
wouldst
thou
suggest
drink
it
was
the
terse
reply
and
shall
be
my
liege
fetch
the
beaker
lackey
identifying
cyril
with
a
royal
gesture
also
crystal
water
from
the
well
which
by
the
command
of
our
cousin
ann
will
speedily
flow
in
a
pipe
within
the
castle
walls
there
are
healths
to
be
drunk
this
day
when
we
assemble
under
the
hamilton
maple
and
first
and
most
loyally
the
health
of
our
american
consul
at
breslau
germany
xxv
following
the
gleam
if
the
summer
months
had
brought
many
changes
to
the
dwellers
in
the
yellow
house
and
the
house
of
lords
the
autumn
was
responsible
for
many
more
cousin
ann
improvements
were
set
in
motion
and
were
promised
to
be
in
full
force
before
cold
weather
set
in
and
the
fall
term
at
beulah
academy
had
opened
with
six
new
unexpected
and
interesting
students
happily
for
the
careys
and
happily
for
beulah
the
old
principal
a
faithful
but
uninspired
teacher
had
been
called
to
massachusetts
to
fill
a
higher
position
and
only
a
few
days
before
the
beginning
of
the
term
a
young
college
man
ralph
thurston
fresh
from
bowdoin
and
needing
experience
applied
for
and
received
the
appointment
the
thrill
of
rapture
that
ran
like
an
electric
current
through
the
persons
of
the
feminine
students
when
they
beheld
ralph
thurston
for
the
first
time
dignified
scholarly
unmistakably
the
gentleman
beheld
him
mount
the
platform
in
the
assembly
room
and
knew
him
for
their
own
this
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
he
was
handsome
he
was
young
he
had
enough
hair
which
their
principals
seldom
had
possessed
he
did
not
wear
spectacles
he
had
a
pleasing
voice
and
a
manner
of
speaking
that
sent
tremors
of
delight
up
and
down
a
spine
he
had
a
merry
wit
and
a
hearty
laugh
but
one
had
only
to
look
at
him
closely
to
feel
that
he
had
borne
burdens
and
that
his
attainments
had
been
bought
with
a
price
he
was
going
to
be
difficult
to
please
and
the
girls
of
all
ages
drew
deep
breaths
of
anticipation
and
knew
that
they
should
study
as
never
before
the
a
lady
of
fine
attainments
was
temporarily
in
eclipse
and
such
an
astounding
love
for
the
classics
swept
through
young
beulah
that
nobody
could
understand
it
ralph
thurston
taught
latin
and
greek
himself
but
parents
did
not
at
first
observe
the
mysterious
connection
between
cause
and
effect
it
was
all
very
young
and
artless
and
innocent
helpful
and
stimulating
too
for
thurston
was
no
budding
ladies
man
but
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
manly
enough
to
attract
the
boys
and
hold
their
interest
the
entrance
of
the
four
careys
and
two
lords
into
the
list
of
students
had
an
inspiring
effect
upon
the
whole
school
so
far
as
scholarship
was
concerned
they
were
often
outstripped
by
their
country
neighbors
but
the
careys
had
seen
so
much
of
the
world
that
they
had
a
great
deal
of
general
culture
and
the
academy
atmosphere
was
affected
by
it
olive
nancy
and
gilbert
went
into
the
highest
class
kathleen
julia
and
cyril
into
the
one
below
the
intimacy
of
nancy
and
olive
was
a
romantic
and
ardent
one
olive
had
never
had
a
real
companion
in
her
life
nancy
friends
dotted
the
universe
wherever
she
had
chanced
to
live
olive
was
uncommunicative
shy
and
stiff
with
all
but
a
chosen
few
nancy
was
at
ease
in
all
assemblies
it
was
nancy
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
and
warmth
that
attracted
olive
lord
and
it
was
the
combination
of
olive
genius
and
her
need
of
love
that
held
nancy
never
were
two
human
creatures
more
unlike
in
their
ways
of
thought
olive
had
lived
in
beulah
seven
years
and
knew
scarcely
any
one
because
of
her
father
eccentricities
and
his
indifference
to
the
world
but
had
you
immured
nancy
in
a
convent
she
would
have
made
a
large
circle
of
acquaintances
from
the
window
of
her
cell
before
a
month
passed
over
her
head
she
had
an
ardent
interest
in
her
fellow
creatures
and
whenever
they
strayed
from
the
strict
path
of
rectitude
she
was
consumed
with
a
desire
to
set
them
straight
if
olive
had
seen
a
drunken
man
lying
in
a
ditch
she
would
scarcely
have
looked
at
him
much
less
inquired
his
name
nancy
would
have
sat
by
until
he
recovered
himself
if
possible
or
found
somebody
to
take
him
to
his
destination
as
for
the
delightful
opportunity
of
persuading
him
of
his
folly
she
would
have
jumped
at
the
chance
when
she
was
fifteen
or
sixteen
but
as
she
grew
older
she
observed
a
little
more
reticence
in
these
delicate
matters
at
least
when
she
was
endeavoring
to
reform
her
elders
she
had
succeeded
in
making
young
nat
harmon
stop
cigarette
smoking
but
he
was
privately
less
convinced
of
the
error
of
his
ways
than
he
was
bewitched
by
nancy
she
promised
readily
to
wear
a
blue
ribbon
and
sit
on
the
platform
in
the
baptist
chapel
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
junior
temperance
league
on
the
eve
of
the
affair
she
even
would
gladly
have
made
a
speech
when
the
president
begged
her
to
do
so
but
the
olive
succeeded
in
stopping
her
and
her
mother
firmly
stood
by
olive
oh
all
right
i
do
care
a
bit
about
it
muddy
she
answered
nonchalantly
only
there
is
something
splendid
about
rising
from
a
band
of
girls
and
boys
and
addressing
the
multitude
for
a
great
cause
what
do
you
know
about
this
great
cause
nancy
dear
at
your
age
oh
not
much
but
you
do
have
to
know
much
if
you
say
it
loud
and
clear
to
the
back
settees
i
watched
how
it
goes
it
was
thrilling
when
we
gave
the
beautiful
queen
in
the
town
hall
when
we
waved
our
hands
and
sang
haman
long
live
haman
i
almost
fainted
with
joy
it
was
very
good
i
liked
it
too
but
perhaps
if
you
with
whenever
your
feet
touch
a
platform
it
will
be
more
prudent
for
you
to
keep
away
and
mother
carey
laughed
very
well
madam
your
will
is
my
law
when
you
see
the
youth
of
beulah
treading
the
broad
road
that
leadeth
to
destruction
and
looking
on
the
wine
when
it
is
red
in
the
cup
remember
that
you
withheld
my
hand
and
voice
gilbert
and
cyril
were
much
together
particularly
after
standing
had
been
increased
in
beulah
by
the
news
that
thurston
thought
him
a
remarkable
mathematician
and
perhaps
the
leading
student
in
his
class
cyril
himself
too
pale
for
a
country
boy
of
fourteen
silent
and
timid
took
this
unexpected
fame
with
absolute
terror
but
olive
pride
delighted
in
it
and
she
positively
bloomed
in
the
knowledge
that
her
brother
was
appreciated
she
herself
secretly
thought
books
were
rather
a
mistake
when
paints
and
brushes
were
at
hand
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
she
did
not
take
high
rank
seeing
that
she
painted
an
hour
before
school
and
all
day
saturday
alternating
her
work
on
the
guest
chamber
of
the
yellow
house
with
her
portrait
of
nancy
for
mother
carey
christmas
present
kathleen
and
julia
had
fallen
into
step
and
were
good
companions
kathleen
had
never
forgotten
her
own
breach
of
good
manners
and
family
loyalty
julia
always
remembered
the
passion
of
remorse
that
kathleen
felt
a
remorse
that
had
colored
her
conduct
to
julia
ever
since
julia
was
a
good
plodder
and
thurston
complimented
her
on
the
excellence
of
her
latin
recitations
when
he
had
his
wits
about
him
and
could
remember
that
she
existed
he
never
had
any
difficulty
in
remembering
nancy
she
was
not
it
must
be
confessed
especially
admirable
as
a
et
reciter
sometimes
she
forgot
entirely
what
the
book
had
said
on
a
certain
topic
but
she
usually
had
some
original
observation
of
her
own
to
offer
by
way
of
compromise
at
first
thurston
thought
that
she
was
trying
to
conceal
her
lack
of
real
knowledge
and
dazzle
her
instructor
at
the
same
time
so
that
he
should
never
discover
her
ignorance
later
on
he
found
where
her
weakness
and
her
strength
lay
she
adapted
invented
modified
things
naturally
embroidered
all
over
her
task
so
to
speak
and
delivered
it
in
somewhat
different
shape
from
the
other
girls
when
she
was
twelve
she
pricked
her
finger
in
sewing
and
made
a
on
the
little
white
mull
apron
that
she
was
making
the
stuff
was
so
delicate
that
she
did
not
dare
to
attempt
any
cleansing
process
and
she
was
in
a
great
hurry
too
so
she
embroidered
a
green
four
leaf
clover
over
the
bloodstain
and
all
the
family
exclaimed
how
like
nancy
grammar
teased
nancy
algebra
and
geometry
routed
her
horse
foot
and
dragoons
no
room
for
embroidery
there
languages
delighted
her
bored
her
and
composition
intoxicated
her
although
she
was
better
at
improvising
than
at
the
real
task
of
setting
down
her
thoughts
in
black
and
white
the
class
chronicles
and
prophecies
and
songs
and
poems
would
flow
to
her
inevitably
but
kathleen
would
be
the
one
who
would
give
new
grace
and
charm
to
them
if
she
were
to
read
them
to
an
audience
how
beulah
academy
beamed
and
applauded
and
wagged
its
head
in
pride
on
a
certain
day
before
thanksgiving
when
there
were
exercises
in
the
assembly
room
olive
had
drawn
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
on
the
largest
of
the
blackboards
and
nancy
had
written
a
merry
little
story
that
caused
great
laughter
and
applause
in
the
youthful
audience
gilbert
had
taken
part
in
a
debate
and
covered
himself
with
glory
and
kathleen
closed
the
impromptu
programme
by
reciting
tennyson
o
young
mariner
you
from
the
haven
under
the
you
that
are
watching
the
gray
magician
with
eyes
of
wonder
follow
the
gleam
great
the
master
and
sweet
the
magic
when
over
the
valley
in
early
summers
over
the
mountain
on
human
faces
and
all
around
me
moving
to
melody
floated
the
gleam
o
young
mariner
down
to
the
haven
call
your
companion
launch
your
vessel
and
crowd
your
canvas
and
ere
it
vanishes
over
the
margin
after
it
follow
it
follow
the
gleam
kathleen
last
year
brown
velveteen
disclosed
bronze
slippers
and
stockings
a
novelty
in
beulah
her
hair
fell
in
such
curls
as
beulah
had
rarely
beheld
and
her
voice
was
as
sweet
as
a
thrush
note
so
perhaps
it
is
not
strange
that
the
poem
set
a
kind
of
fashion
at
the
academy
and
following
the
gleam
became
a
sort
of
text
by
which
to
study
and
grow
and
live
thanksgiving
day
approached
and
everybody
was
praying
for
a
flurry
of
snow
just
enough
to
give
a
zest
to
turkey
and
cranberry
sauce
on
the
twentieth
it
suddenly
occurred
to
mother
carey
that
this
typical
new
england
feast
day
would
be
just
the
proper
time
for
the
housewarming
so
the
lord
children
the
pophams
and
the
harmons
were
all
bidden
to
come
at
seven
in
the
evening
great
preparations
ensued
rows
of
jack
o
lanterns
decorated
the
piazza
and
the
careys
had
fewer
pumpkin
pies
in
november
than
their
neighbors
in
consequence
of
their
extravagant
inroads
upon
the
golden
treasures
of
the
aft
garden
inside
were
a
few
late
asters
and
branches
of
evergreen
and
the
illumination
suggested
that
somebody
had
been
lending
additional
lamps
and
candles
for
the
occasion
the
original
equipment
of
clothes
possessed
by
the
careys
on
their
arrival
in
beulah
still
held
good
and
looked
well
by
lamplight
so
that
the
toilettes
were
fully
worthy
of
so
important
a
function
olive
picture
of
nancy
was
finished
and
she
announced
the
absolute
impossibility
of
keeping
it
until
christmas
so
it
reached
the
yellow
house
on
thanksgiving
morning
when
it
was
unwrapped
by
nancy
and
displayed
for
the
first
time
to
the
family
mother
carey
lips
parted
her
eyes
opened
in
wonder
but
no
words
came
for
an
instant
in
the
bewilderment
of
her
mind
olive
had
written
the
title
young
april
under
the
picture
nancy
stood
on
a
bit
of
turf
a
budding
tree
in
the
background
her
arm
flung
over
the
neck
of
a
jersey
calf
the
calf
had
sat
for
his
portrait
long
before
but
nancy
had
been
added
since
may
olive
by
a
clever
inspiration
had
turned
nancy
face
away
and
painted
her
with
the
april
breeze
blowing
her
hair
across
her
cheek
she
was
not
good
at
painting
features
her
art
was
too
crude
but
somehow
the
real
thing
was
there
and
the
likeness
to
nancy
in
figure
pose
and
hair
was
so
unmistakable
that
her
mother
caught
her
breath
as
for
the
calf
he
at
least
was
distinctly
in
olive
line
and
he
was
painted
with
a
touch
of
genius
it
is
better
of
the
calf
than
it
is
of
you
nancy
said
gilbert
critically
is
bossy
lovely
his
sister
responded
amiably
would
he
put
any
professional
beauty
out
of
countenance
i
am
proud
to
be
painted
beside
him
do
you
like
it
muddy
dear
like
it
she
exclaimed
it
is
wonderful
it
must
be
sent
to
boston
for
criticism
and
we
must
invent
some
way
of
persuading
lord
to
give
olive
the
best
instruction
to
be
had
this
picture
is
even
better
than
anything
she
has
done
in
the
painted
chamber
i
should
wonder
a
bit
nancy
if
little
beulah
were
to
be
very
proud
of
olive
in
the
years
to
come
nancy
was
transported
at
her
mother
praise
i
felt
it
i
knew
it
i
always
said
olive
was
a
genius
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
olive
is
the
gleam
ca
you
feel
the
wind
blowing
my
hair
and
dress
do
you
see
that
the
calf
is
chewing
his
cud
and
is
going
to
move
in
just
a
minute
olive
animals
are
always
just
going
to
move
oh
muddy
dear
when
you
see
olive
nowadays
smiling
and
busy
and
happy
are
you
glad
you
stretched
your
wings
and
took
her
under
them
with
the
rest
of
us
and
do
you
think
you
could
make
a
out
of
henry
lord
or
is
he
too
old
a
beast
even
for
mother
carey
xxvi
a
zoological
father
that
was
just
what
mother
carey
was
wondering
when
nancy
spoke
and
as
the
result
of
several
hours
reflection
she
went
out
for
a
walk
just
before
dusk
and
made
her
way
towards
the
cedars
with
a
package
under
her
cloak
she
followed
the
long
lane
that
led
to
the
house
and
knocked
at
the
front
door
rather
timidly
in
her
own
good
time
bangs
answered
the
knock
and
admitted
carey
into
the
dreariest
sitting
room
she
had
ever
entered
i
am
carey
from
the
hamilton
house
she
said
to
bangs
will
you
ask
lord
if
he
will
see
me
for
a
moment
bangs
was
stupefied
at
the
request
for
in
her
time
scarcely
a
single
caller
from
the
village
had
crossed
the
threshold
although
there
had
been
occasional
visitors
from
portland
or
boston
carey
waited
a
few
moments
silently
regarding
the
unequalled
bareness
ugliness
and
cheerlessness
of
the
room
olive
has
a
sense
of
beauty
she
thought
and
olive
is
sixteen
it
is
olive
who
ought
to
make
this
place
different
from
what
it
is
and
she
can
unless
her
father
is
the
in
the
way
at
this
moment
the
possible
henry
lord
came
in
and
greeted
her
civilly
his
manner
was
never
genial
for
there
was
neither
love
in
his
heart
nor
warm
blood
in
his
veins
but
he
was
courteous
for
he
was
an
educated
fossil
of
good
birth
and
he
had
been
dissecting
specimens
in
his
workroom
and
he
looked
capable
of
dismembering
mother
carey
but
bless
your
heart
she
had
weapons
in
her
unseen
armory
that
were
capable
of
bringing
confusion
to
his
paltry
apparatus
among
others
a
delicate
slender
little
sword
that
pierced
deep
on
occasion
henry
lord
was
of
medium
height
spare
with
scanty
auburn
hair
high
forehead
and
small
keen
eyes
especially
adapted
to
the
microscope
though
ill
fitted
to
use
in
friendly
conversation
we
are
neighbors
professor
lord
though
we
have
never
met
said
carey
rising
and
giving
him
her
hand
my
children
know
you
better
than
i
he
answered
and
i
feel
it
very
kind
in
you
to
allow
them
to
call
on
you
so
frequently
they
had
lived
at
the
yellow
house
for
four
months
save
at
meal
times
but
as
their
father
was
unaware
of
the
number
and
extent
of
their
visits
carey
thought
it
useless
to
speak
of
them
so
she
merely
said
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
have
them
with
us
my
children
have
left
many
friends
behind
them
in
massachusetts
and
elsewhere
and
might
have
been
lonely
in
beulah
besides
i
often
think
the
larger
the
group
within
certain
limits
the
better
chance
children
have
of
learning
how
to
live
i
should
certainly
not
have
permitted
olive
and
cyril
to
attend
the
local
academy
but
for
your
family
said
professor
lord
these
country
schools
never
have
any
atmosphere
of
true
scholarliness
and
the
speech
and
manners
of
both
teachers
and
pupils
are
execrable
i
dare
say
that
is
often
the
case
if
the
academies
could
furnish
such
teachers
as
existed
fifty
years
ago
and
alas
if
we
parents
could
furnish
such
vigorous
determined
ambitious
pupils
as
used
to
be
sent
out
from
country
homes
we
should
have
less
to
complain
of
of
course
we
are
peculiarly
fortunate
here
in
beulah
lord
looked
faintly
amused
and
infinitely
superior
i
am
afraid
my
dear
lady
he
remarked
that
you
have
not
had
long
enough
experience
to
comprehend
the
slenderness
of
philpot
mental
equipment
oh
philpot
resigned
nearly
three
months
ago
said
carey
easily
giving
henry
lord
her
first
stab
and
a
look
of
amusement
on
her
own
behalf
ralph
thurston
the
present
principal
is
a
fine
unusual
fellow
really
the
children
have
never
mentioned
any
change
but
i
regret
to
say
i
am
at
meals
the
death
of
my
wife
left
many
gaps
in
the
life
of
the
household
so
that
you
have
to
be
mother
and
father
in
one
stab
two
very
delicately
delivered
i
fear
i
am
too
much
of
a
student
to
be
called
a
good
family
man
so
i
gathered
stab
three
she
wanted
to
provoke
curiosity
lord
looked
annoyed
he
knew
his
unpopularity
and
did
not
wish
any
village
gossip
to
reach
the
ears
of
strangers
you
my
dear
madam
are
capable
of
appreciating
my
devotion
to
my
life
work
which
the
neighbors
naturally
wholly
misunderstand
he
said
i
gathered
nothing
from
the
neighbors
responded
carey
but
a
woman
has
only
to
know
children
well
to
see
at
a
glance
what
they
need
you
are
so
absorbed
in
authorship
just
now
that
naturally
it
is
a
little
hard
for
the
young
people
but
i
suppose
there
are
breathing
places
books
there
are
no
breathing
places
between
mine
there
will
be
six
volumes
and
i
am
scarcely
half
through
the
third
although
i
have
given
seven
years
to
the
work
still
i
have
an
excellent
housekeeper
who
attends
to
all
our
simple
needs
my
children
are
not
fitted
for
society
no
not
quite
stab
four
that
is
the
reason
they
ought
to
see
a
good
deal
of
it
but
they
are
very
fine
children
and
very
clever
i
am
glad
you
think
so
but
they
certainly
write
bad
english
and
have
no
general
knowledge
whatsoever
oh
well
that
will
come
doubtless
when
you
have
more
time
with
them
stab
five
i
often
think
such
mysterious
things
as
good
speech
and
culture
can
never
be
learned
in
school
i
should
wonder
if
that
were
our
department
dr
lord
stab
six
however
you
will
agree
modest
parent
as
you
are
that
your
olive
is
a
genius
i
have
never
observed
it
replied
her
father
i
can
not
of
course
allow
her
to
practice
on
any
musical
instrument
because
my
studies
demand
quiet
but
i
do
think
she
cares
for
music
she
draws
and
paints
however
in
the
most
astonishing
way
and
she
has
a
passionate
energy
and
concentration
and
devotion
to
her
work
that
i
have
never
seen
coupled
with
anything
but
an
extraordinary
talent
she
is
destined
to
go
very
far
in
my
opinion
not
too
far
i
hope
remarked
lord
with
an
icy
smile
olive
can
paint
on
plush
and
china
as
much
as
she
likes
but
i
am
not
partial
to
for
young
women
nor
am
i
save
when
the
gift
is
so
commanding
so
obvious
that
it
has
to
be
reckoned
with
but
i
must
not
delay
my
business
any
longer
nor
keep
you
from
your
work
we
are
having
a
housewarming
this
evening
at
seven
olive
and
cyril
are
there
now
helping
in
the
preparations
and
i
want
to
know
if
they
may
stay
to
supper
and
if
you
can
send
for
them
at
half
past
nine
or
ten
certainly
they
may
stay
though
i
should
think
your
supper
table
could
hardly
stand
the
strain
where
there
are
five
already
two
more
make
no
difference
save
in
better
appetite
for
all
said
mother
carey
smiling
and
rising
if
you
will
allow
me
to
get
my
hat
and
coat
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
main
road
said
lord
going
to
the
front
hall
and
then
opening
the
door
for
carey
let
me
take
your
parcel
please
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
why
he
said
it
and
why
he
did
it
the
lady
had
interfered
with
his
family
affairs
to
a
considerable
extent
and
had
made
several
remarks
that
would
have
appeared
impertinent
had
they
not
issued
from
a
very
winsome
beautiful
mouth
ossian
popham
or
bill
harmon
would
have
been
shown
the
door
for
saying
less
yet
here
was
henry
lord
ambling
down
the
lane
by
mother
carey
side
thinking
to
himself
what
a
burden
she
lifted
from
his
shoulders
by
her
unaccountable
interest
in
his
unattractive
children
he
was
also
thinking
how
springy
was
the
lady
step
in
her
short
black
dress
how
brilliant
the
chestnut
hair
looked
under
the
black
felt
hat
and
how
white
the
skin
gleamed
above
the
glossy
lynx
boa
a
kind
of
mucilaginous
fluid
ran
in
his
veins
instead
of
blood
but
henry
lord
had
his
assailable
side
nevertheless
and
he
felt
extraordinarily
good
natured
almost
as
if
the
third
volume
were
finished
with
public
and
publishers
clamoring
for
its
appearance
i
do
know
where
olive
could
have
got
any
such
talent
as
you
describe
he
said
as
they
were
walking
along
the
lane
she
had
some
lessons
long
ago
i
remember
and
her
mother
used
to
talk
of
her
amusing
herself
with
pencil
and
paint
but
i
have
heard
nothing
of
it
for
years
ask
to
see
her
sketches
when
you
are
talking
with
her
about
her
work
some
day
suggested
mother
carey
stab
seven
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
probably
gets
her
talent
from
you
from
me
printed
letters
fail
to
register
the
amazement
in
professor
lord
tone
why
not
when
you
consider
her
specialty
specialty
really
a
slender
sword
was
of
no
use
with
this
man
a
bludgeon
was
the
only
instrument
yet
it
might
wound
and
she
only
wanted
to
prick
had
the
creature
never
seen
olive
sketching
nor
noted
her
choice
of
subjects
she
paints
animals
paints
nothing
else
if
she
can
help
it
though
she
does
fairly
well
with
other
things
is
it
impossible
that
your
study
of
zoology
your
thought
your
absorption
for
years
and
years
in
the
classification
the
structure
the
habits
of
animals
may
have
been
stamped
on
your
child
mind
she
has
an
ardor
equal
to
your
own
only
showing
itself
in
a
different
manner
you
may
have
passed
on
in
some
mysterious
way
your
knowledge
to
olive
she
may
have
unconsciously
blended
it
with
some
instinct
for
expression
of
her
own
and
it
comes
out
in
pictures
look
at
this
professor
lord
olive
gave
it
to
me
they
stood
together
at
the
gate
leading
out
into
the
road
and
carey
unwrapped
the
painting
and
poised
it
against
the
top
of
the
gate
olive
father
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
and
then
said
i
am
no
judge
of
these
things
technically
or
otherwise
but
it
certainly
seems
very
creditable
work
for
a
girl
of
olive
age
oh
it
is
surely
more
than
that
my
girl
nancy
stands
there
in
the
flesh
though
her
face
is
hidden
look
at
the
wind
blowing
look
at
the
delightful
the
enchanting
calf
above
all
look
at
the
title
who
in
the
world
but
a
little
genius
could
have
composed
that
sketch
breathing
youth
in
every
inch
of
it
and
called
it
april
oh
professor
lord
i
am
very
bold
because
your
wife
is
not
living
and
it
is
women
who
oftenest
see
these
budding
tendencies
in
children
forgive
me
but
do
cherish
and
develop
this
talent
of
olive
the
eyes
the
color
of
the
blue
velvet
bonnet
were
turned
full
upon
henry
lord
they
swam
in
tears
and
the
color
came
and
went
in
her
cheek
she
was
forty
but
it
was
a
lovely
cheek
still
i
will
think
it
over
he
replied
with
some
embarrassment
as
he
wrapped
the
picture
again
and
handed
it
to
her
meantime
i
am
certainly
very
much
obliged
to
you
you
seem
to
have
an
uncommon
knowledge
of
young
people
may
i
ask
if
you
are
or
have
been
a
teacher
oh
no
carey
remarked
with
a
smile
i
am
just
a
mother
that
all
good
night
xxvii
the
carey
housewarming
the
housewarming
was
at
its
height
and
everybody
agreed
once
in
every
ten
minutes
that
it
was
probably
the
most
beautiful
party
that
had
ever
happened
in
the
history
of
the
world
water
flowed
freely
through
cousin
ann
expensive
pipes
that
had
been
buried
so
deep
in
their
trenches
that
the
winter
frosts
could
not
affect
them
natty
harmon
tried
the
kitchen
pump
secretly
several
times
during
the
evening
for
the
water
had
to
run
up
hill
all
the
way
from
the
well
to
the
kitchen
sink
and
he
believed
this
to
be
a
continual
miracle
that
might
give
out
at
any
moment
the
stove
in
the
cellar
always
alluded
to
by
gilbert
as
the
young
furnace
had
not
yet
been
used
save
by
way
of
experiment
but
it
was
believed
to
be
a
perfect
success
there
was
no
need
of
extra
heat
and
there
were
great
ceremonies
to
be
observed
in
lighting
the
fires
on
the
hearthstones
they
began
with
the
one
in
the
family
sitting
room
colonel
wheeler
ralph
thurston
and
bill
harmon
with
natty
and
rufus
and
popham
with
digby
and
lallie
joy
all
standing
in
admiring
groups
and
thrilling
with
delight
at
the
order
of
events
mother
carey
sat
by
the
fireplace
little
peter
fairly
radiant
with
excitement
leaning
against
her
knee
and
waiting
for
his
own
great
moment
now
close
at
hand
ye
come
into
a
house
salute
it
and
if
the
house
be
worthy
let
your
peace
come
upon
all
those
who
may
dwell
therein
from
generation
to
generation
may
it
be
a
house
of
god
a
gate
of
every
house
is
builded
by
some
man
but
he
that
built
all
things
is
god
seeing
that
he
giveth
to
every
one
of
us
life
and
breath
and
all
good
mother
carey
spoke
these
words
so
simply
and
naturally
as
she
looked
towards
her
neighbors
one
after
another
with
her
hand
resting
on
peter
curly
head
that
they
hardly
knew
whether
to
keep
quiet
or
say
amen
was
that
the
bible
osh
whispered
bill
harmon
do
know
everything
she
says
sounds
like
the
bible
or
shakespeare
to
me
in
the
hush
that
followed
mother
carey
salutation
gilbert
approached
with
a
basket
over
his
arm
and
quickly
and
neatly
laid
a
little
fire
behind
the
brass
andirons
on
the
hearth
then
nancy
handed
peter
a
loosely
bound
sheaf
saying
to
light
this
fire
i
give
you
a
torch
in
it
are
herbs
of
the
field
for
health
of
the
body
a
fern
leaf
for
grace
a
sprig
of
elm
for
peace
one
of
oak
for
strength
with
evergreen
to
show
that
we
live
forever
in
the
deeds
we
have
done
to
these
we
have
added
rosemary
for
remembrance
and
pansies
for
thoughts
peter
crouched
on
the
hearth
and
lighted
the
fire
in
three
places
then
handed
the
torch
to
kathleen
as
he
crept
again
into
his
mother
lap
awed
into
complete
silence
by
the
influence
of
his
own
mystic
rite
kathleen
waved
the
torch
to
and
fro
as
she
recited
some
beautiful
lines
written
for
some
such
purpose
as
that
which
called
them
together
burn
fire
burn
flicker
flicker
flame
whose
hand
above
this
blaze
is
lifted
shall
be
with
touch
of
magic
gifted
to
warm
the
hearts
of
chilly
mortals
who
stand
without
these
open
portals
the
touch
shall
draw
them
to
this
fire
nigher

by
desire
whoso
shall
stand
on
this
shall
never
never
stand
alone
whose
home
is
dark
and
drear
and

whose
hearth
is

this
is
his
own

footnote
florence
converse
next
came
olive
turn
to
help
in
the
ceremonies
ralph
thurston
had
found
a
line
of
latin
for
them
in
his
beloved
horace
splendet
for
you
the
shines
olive
had
painted
the
motto
on
a
long
narrow
panel
of
canvas
and
giving
it
to
popham
stood
by
the
fireside
while
he
deftly
fitted
it
into
the
place
prepared
for
it
the
family
had
feared
that
he
would
tell
a
good
story
when
he
found
himself
the
centre
of
attraction
but
he
was
as
dumb
as
peter
and
for
the
same
reason
olive
has
another
lovely
gift
for
the
yellow
house
said
mother
carey
rising
and
to
carry
out
the
next
part
of
the
programme
we
shall
have
to
go
in
procession
upstairs
to
my
bedroom
guess
there
wa
many
idees
to
give
round
to
other
folks
after
the
lord
made
exclaimed
bill
harmon
to
his
wife
as
they
went
through
the
lighted
hall
gilbert
at
the
head
of
the
procession
held
mother
hamilton
picture
which
had
been
taken
from
the
old
brick
oven
where
my
son
tom
had
hidden
it
mother
carey
bedroom
with
its
bouquets
of
field
flowers
on
the
wall
paper
was
gaily
lighted
and
ready
to
receive
the
gift
nancy
stood
on
a
chair
and
hung
the
portrait
over
the
fireplace
saying
we
place
this
picture
here
in
memory
of
agatha
mother
of
lemuel
hamilton
owner
of
the
yellow
house
underneath
it
we
lay
a
posy
of
pressed
daisies
buttercups
and
queen
anne
lace
the
wild
flowers
she
loved
best
now
olive
took
away
a
green
garland
covering
the
words
that
she
had
painted
in
brown
letters
just
over
the
bricks
of
the
fireplace
the
letters
were
in
old
english
text
and
a
riot
of
buttercups
and
grasses
twined
their
way
amongst
them
stands
for
dear
said
nancy
and
thus
this
room
will
be
full
of
memories
of
two
dear
mothers
an
absent
and
a
present
one
then
kathleen
and
gilbert
and
julia
mother
carey
and
peter
bowed
their
heads
and
said
in
chorus
thou
who
dwellest
in
so
many
homes
possess
thyself
of
this
thou
who
settest
the
solitary
in
families
bless
the
life
that
is
sheltered
here
grant
that
trust
and
peace
and
comfort
may
abide
within
and
that
love
and
light
and
usefulness
may
go
out
from
this
house
forever
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
all
the
party
descended
the
stairs
to
the
dining
room
ai
they
the
greatest
murmured
lallie
joy
turning
to
her
father
but
he
had
disappeared
from
the
group
the
dining
room
was
a
blaze
of
glory
and
great
merriment
ensued
as
they
took
their
places
at
the
table
mother
carey
poured
coffee
nancy
chocolate
and
the
others
helped
serve
the
sandwiches
and
cake
doughnuts
and
tarts
where
is
mr
popham
asked
nancy
at
the
foot
of
the
table
we
can
not
be
happy
without
mr
popham
at
that
moment
the
gentleman
entered
bearing
a
huge
object
concealed
by
a
piece
of
green
felt
approaching
the
dining
table
he
carefully
placed
the
article
in
the
centre
and
removed
the
cloth
it
was
the
dirty
boy
carefully
mended
the
guests
naturally
had
no
associations
with
the
carey
curse
and
the
careys
themselves
were
dumb
with
amazement
and
despair
i
seen
this
thing
layin
in
the
barn
chamber
in
a
thousand
pieces
all
summer
explained
popham
radiantly
it
wa
none
o
my
business
if
the
family
throwed
it
away
thinkin
it
wa
no
more
good
thinks
i
to
myself
i
never
seen
anything
osh
popham
could
mend
if
he
took
time
enough
and
glue
enough
so
i
carried
this
little
feller
home
in
a
bushel
basket
one
night
last
month
an
i
spent
eleven
puttin
him
together
i
do
claim
he
good
new
he
ai
but
he
he
was
when
i
found
him
layin
in
the
barn
chamber
thank
you
mr
popham
said
carey
her
eyes
twinkling
as
she
looked
at
the
laughing
children
it
was
kind
of
you
to
spend
so
much
time
in
our
behalf
well
i
says
to
myself
there
nothin
too
good
for
an
when
it
comes
thanksgivin
i
give
one
thing
more
to
be
thankful
for
quit
talkin
pop
will
yer
whispered
digby
nudging
his
father
you
kep
us
from
startin
to
eat
five
minutes
an
as
holler
as
a
horn
it
was
as
cheery
gay
festive
neighborly
and
friendly
a
supper
as
ever
took
place
in
the
dining
room
of
the
yellow
house
although
governor
weatherby
may
have
had
some
handsomer
banquets
in
his
time
when
it
was
over
all
made
their
way
into
the
rosy
bowery
summer
parlor
soon
another
fire
sparkled
and
snapped
on
the
hearth
and
there
were
songs
and
poems
and
choruses
and
osh
popham
fiddle
to
say
nothing
of
the
supreme
event
of
the
evening
his
rendition
of
fly
like
a
youthful
hart
or
roe
over
the
hills
where
spices
grow
to
mother
carey
accompaniment
he
always
slipped
up
his
glasses
during
this
performance
and
closed
his
eyes
but
neither
grey
hairs
nor
specs
could
dim
the
radiant
smile
that
made
him
seem
about
fifteen
years
old
and
the
junior
of
both
his
children
harmon
thought
he
sang
too
much
and
told
her
husband
privately
that
if
he
was
a
canary
bird
she
should
want
to
keep
a
table
cover
over
his
head
most
of
the
time
but
he
was
immensely
popular
with
the
rest
of
his
audience
last
of
all
the
entire
company
gathered
round
the
piano
for
a
parting
hymn
the
face
of
the
mahogany
shone
with
delight
and
why
not
when
it
was
doing
everything
almost
everything
within
the
scope
of
a
piano
and
yet
the
family
had
enjoyed
weeks
of
good
nourishing
meals
on
what
had
been
saved
by
its
exertions
also
what
rational
family
could
mourn
the
loss
of
an
irregularly
shaped
instrument
standing
on
three
legs
and
played
on
one
corner
the
tall
silver
candle
sticks
gleamed
in
the
firelight
the
silver
dish
of
polished
baldwins
blushed
rosier
in
the
glow
mother
carey
played
the
dear
old
common
metre
tune
and
the
voices
rang
out
in
whittier
hymn
the
careys
all
sang
like
thrushes
and
even
peter
holding
his
hymn
book
upside
down
put
in
little
bird
notes
always
on
the
key
whenever
he
caught
a
familiar
strain
once
more
the
liberal
year
laughs
out
richer
stores
than
gems
or
gold
once
more
with
and
shout
is
nature
bloodless
triumph
told
we
shut
our
eyes
the
flowers
bloom
on
we
murmur
but
the
fill
we
choose
the
shadow
but
the
sun
that
casts
it
shines
behind
us
still
o
favors
every
year
made
new
o
gifts
with
rain
and
sunshine
sent
the
bounty
overruns
our
due
the
fulness
shames
our
discontent

focus
there
was
one
watcher
of
all
this
and
one
listener
outside
of
the
yellow
house
that
none
of
the
party
suspected
and
that
was
henry
lord
when
he
left
carey
at
the
gate
at
five
he
went
back
to
his
own
house
and
ordered
his
supper
to
be
brought
him
on
a
tray
in
his
study
he
particularly
liked
this
always
as
it
freed
him
from
all
responsibility
of
serving
his
children
and
making
an
occasional
remark
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
everybody
was
as
pleased
as
he
when
he
ate
alone
the
occasional
meals
olive
and
cyril
had
by
themselves
being
the
only
ones
they
ever
enjoyed
or
digested
he
studied
and
wrote
and
consulted
heavy
tomes
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
pulled
out
colored
plates
from
portfolios
all
with
great
satisfaction
until
he
chanced
to
look
at
the
clock
when
it
struck
ten
he
had
forgotten
to
send
for
the
children
as
he
had
promised
mother
carey
he
went
out
into
the
hall
and
called
bangs
in
a
stentorian
voice
no
answer
irritated
as
he
always
was
when
crossed
in
the
slightest
degree
he
went
downstairs
and
found
the
kitchen
empty
her
cub
of
a
nephew
has
been
staying
to
supper
with
her
guzzling
and
cramming
himself
at
my
expense
he
thought
and
now
she
has
walked
home
with
him
it
perfect
nonsense
to
go
after
a
girl
of
sixteen
and
a
boy
of
thirteen
as
if
they
could
walk
along
a
country
road
at
ten
still
it
may
look
odd
if
some
one
does
go
and
i
ca
lock
the
house
till
they
come
anyway
he
drew
on
his
great
coat
put
on
his
cap
and
started
down
the
lane
in
no
good
humor
it
was
a
crisp
starlight
night
and
the
ground
was
freezing
fast
he
walked
along
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
bent
as
he
went
through
the
gate
to
the
main
road
he
glanced
up
the
yellow
house
a
third
of
a
mile
distant
was
a
blaze
of
light
there
must
have
been
a
candle
or
a
lamp
in
every
one
of
its
windows
he
thought
the
ground
rose
a
little
where
the
house
stood
and
although
it
could
not
be
seen
in
summer
because
of
the
dense
foliage
everywhere
the
trees
were
nearly
bare
now
my
handsome
neighbor
is
extravagant
he
said
to
himself
with
a
grim
smile
is
the
illumination
for
thanksgiving
i
wonder
oh
no
i
remember
she
said
the
party
was
in
the
nature
of
a
housewarming
as
he
went
up
the
pathway
he
saw
that
the
shades
were
up
and
no
curtains
drawn
anywhere
the
yellow
house
had
no
intention
of
hiding
its
lights
under
bushels
that
evening
of
all
others
besides
there
were
no
neighbors
within
a
long
distance
standing
on
the
lowest
of
the
governor
steps
he
could
see
the
corner
where
the
group
stood
singing
with
shining
faces
once
more
the
liberal
year
laughs
out
richer
stores
than
gems
or
gold
mother
carey
fine
head
rose
nobly
from
her
simple
black
dress
and
her
throat
was
as
white
as
the
deep
lace
collar
that
was
her
only
ornament
nancy
he
knew
by
sight
and
nancy
in
a
crimson
dress
was
singing
her
thankful
heart
out
who
was
the
girl
standing
by
her
side
the
two
with
arms
round
each
other
waists
his
own
olive
he
had
always
thought
her
unattractive
but
her
hair
was
smoothly
braided
and
her
eyes
all
aglow
cyril
stood
between
gilbert
and
mother
carey
cyril
he
knew
could
not
carry
a
tune
to
save
his
life
but
he
seemed
to
be
opening
his
lips
and
uttering
words
all
the
same
where
was
the
timid
eye
the
hangdog
look
the
shrinking
manner
he
so
disliked
in
his
son
great
heavens
the
boy
laid
his
hand
on
carey
shoulder
and
beat
time
there
gently
with
a
finger
as
if
a
mother
shoulder
could
be
used
for
any
nice
necessary
sort
of
purpose
if
he
knocked
at
the
door
now
he
thought
he
should
interrupt
the
party
which
was
seemingly
at
its
height
he
henry
lord
certainly
had
no
intention
of
going
in
to
join
it
not
with
ossian
popham
and
bill
harmon
as
fellow
guests
he
made
his
way
curiously
around
the
outside
of
the
house
looking
in
at
all
the
windows
and
by
choosing
various
positions
seeing
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
different
rooms
finally
he
went
up
on
the
little
back
piazza
attracted
by
the
firelight
in
the
family
sitting
room
there
was
a
noble
fire
and
once
while
he
was
looking
digby
popham
stole
quietly
in
braced
up
the
logs
with
a
proprietary
air
swept
up
the
hearth
replaced
the
brass
wire
screen
and
stole
out
again
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
he
might
not
miss
too
much
of
the
party
they
seem
to
feel
pretty
much
at
home
thought
lord
the
fire
blazed
higher
and
brighter
it
lighted
up
certain
words
painted
in
dark
green
and
gold
on
the
white
panel
under
the
mantelpiece
he
pressed
his
face
quite
close
to
the
window
thinking
that
he
must
be
mistaken
in
seeing
such
unconnected
letters
as
but
gradually
they
looked
clearer
to
him
and
he
read
distinctly
tibi
splendet
focus
somebody
knows
his
horace
thought
henry
lord
as
he
stumbled
off
the
piazza
you
the
glows
i
sha
go
in
not
with
that
crew
let
them
wait
and
if
it
gets
too
late
somebody
else
will
walk
home
with
the
children
for
you
the
glows
he
picked
his
way
along
the
side
of
the
house
to
the
front
every
window
sending
out
its
candle
gleam
for
you
the
glows
from
dozens
of
windows
the
welcome
shone
its
gleams
and
sparkles
positively
pursued
him
as
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
road
and
his
own
dark
cheerless
house
perhaps
he
had
better
on
the
whole
keep
one
lamp
burning
in
the
lower
part
after
this
to
show
that
the
place
was
inhabited
for
you
the
glows
he
had
bricked
up
the
fireplace
in
his
study
and
put
an
stove
in
because
it
was
simply
impossible
to
feed
an
open
fire
and
write
a
book
at
the
same
time
he
did
know
that
you
could
write
twice
as
good
a
book
in
half
the
time
with
an
open
fire
to
help
you
he
know
any
single
one
of
the
myriad
aids
that
can
come
to
you
from
such
cheery
unexpected
sources
of
grace
and
inspiration
for
you
the
glows
would
the
words
never
stop
ringing
in
his
ears
perhaps
after
all
it
would
look
queer
to
carey
he
cared
nothing
for
popham
or
harmon
opinion
if
he
left
the
children
to
get
home
by
themselves
perhaps
for
you
the
glows
henry
lord
ascended
the
steps
and
plied
the
knocker
digby
popham
came
out
of
the
parlor
and
opened
the
front
door
everybody
listened
to
see
who
was
the
late
comer
at
the
party
will
you
kindly
tell
miss
olive
and
master
cyril
lord
that
their
father
has
called
for
them
lord
cold
severe
voice
sounded
clearly
in
the
parlor
and
every
word
could
be
distinctly
heard
gilbert
and
nancy
were
standing
together
and
gilbert
whispered
instantly
to
his
sister
the
old
beast
has
actually
called
for
olive
and
cyril
hush
gilly
he
must
be
a
beast
or
he
would
have
come
at
all
answered
nancy
xxix
th
action
fine
december
january
and
february
passed
with
a
speed
that
had
something
of
magic
in
it
the
careys
had
known
nothing
heretofore
of
the
rigors
of
a
state
o
maine
winter
but
as
yet
they
counted
it
all
joy
they
were
young
and
hearty
and
merry
and
the
air
seemed
to
give
them
all
new
energy
kathleen
delicate
throat
gave
no
trouble
for
the
first
time
in
years
nancy
cheeks
bloomed
more
like
roses
than
ever
gilbert
growing
broader
shouldered
and
deeper
chested
daily
simply
revelled
in
skating
and
coasting
even
julia
was
forced
into
an
activity
wholly
alien
to
her
nature
because
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
keep
warm
unless
she
kept
busy
mother
carey
and
peter
used
to
look
from
a
bedroom
window
of
a
clear
cold
morning
and
see
the
gay
little
procession
start
for
the
academy
over
the
dazzling
snow
crust
olive
and
cyril
lord
would
be
skimming
to
meet
the
careys
always
at
the
same
point
at
the
same
hour
there
were
rough
red
coats
and
capes
red
mittens
squirrel
caps
pulled
well
down
over
curly
and
smooth
heads
glimpses
of
red
woolen
stockings
thick
shoes
with
rubbers
over
them
great
parcels
of
books
in
straps
they
looked
like
a
flock
of
cardinal
birds
mother
carey
thought
as
the
upturned
faces
all
aglow
with
ruddy
color
smiled
their
morning
gilbert
had
stoked
the
great
stove
in
the
cellar
full
of
hard
wood
logs
before
he
left
and
carey
and
peter
had
a
busy
morning
before
them
with
the
housework
the
family
had
risen
at
seven
julia
had
swept
and
dusted
kathleen
had
opened
the
bedroom
windows
made
the
washstands
tidy
filled
the
water
pitchers
and
changed
the
towels
gilbert
had
carried
wood
and
peter
kindlings
for
the
fires
that
had
to
be
laid
on
the
hearths
here
and
there
mother
had
cooked
the
plain
breakfast
while
nancy
put
the
dining
room
in
order
and
set
the
table
and
at
eight
when
they
sat
down
to
plates
piled
high
with
slices
of
brown
and
white
bread
to
dishes
of
eggs
or
cod
fish
or
beans
warmed
over
in
the
pot
with
baked
potatoes
sometimes
and
sometimes
milk
toast
or
nancy
famous
corn
muffins
no
family
of
young
bears
ever
displayed
such
appetites
on
saturday
mornings
there
were
griddle
cakes
and
maple
syrup
from
their
own
trees
for
osh
popham
had
shown
them
in
the
spring
how
to
tap
their
maples
and
collect
the
great
pails
of
sap
to
boil
down
into
syrup
mother
carey
and
peter
made
the
beds
after
the
departure
of
the
others
for
school
and
it
was
pretty
to
see
the
sturdy
sometimes
in
his
coat
and
mittens
standing
on
the
easiest
side
of
the
beds
and
helping
his
mother
to
spread
the
blankets
and
comforters
smooth
his
fat
legs
carried
him
up
and
downstairs
a
dozen
times
on
errands
while
his
sweet
piping
voice
was
lifted
in
a
never
ending
stream
of
genial
conversation
as
he
told
his
mother
what
he
had
just
done
what
he
was
doing
at
the
present
moment
how
he
was
doing
it
and
what
he
proposed
to
do
in
a
minute
or
two
then
there
was
a
lull
from
half
past
ten
to
half
past
eleven
shortened
sometimes
on
baking
days
when
the
had
his
lessons
the
kitchen
was
clean
and
shining
by
that
time
the
stove
glistened
and
the
fire
snapped
and
crackled
the
sun
beamed
in
at
the
sink
window
doing
all
he
could
for
the
climate
in
the
few
hours
he
was
permitted
to
be
on
duty
in
a
short
new
england
winter
day
peter
sat
on
a
cricket
beside
his
mother
chair
and
clasped
his
reading
without
tears
earnestly
and
rigidly
believing
it
to
be
the
key
to
the
universe
oh
what
an
hour
of
happiness
to
mother
carey
when
the
boy
would
lift
the
very
copy
of
his
father
face
to
her
own
when
the
smile
and
the
dear
twinkle
of
the
eyes
in
peter
face
would
give
her
heart
a
stab
of
pain
that
was
half
joy
after
all
it
was
so
full
to
the
brim
of
sweet
memories
in
that
warm
still
hour
when
she
was
filling
the
mind
and
soul
with
heavenly
learning
how
much
she
learned
herself
love
poured
from
her
through
voice
and
lips
and
eyes
and
in
return
she
drank
it
in
thirstily
from
the
little
creature
who
sat
there
at
her
knee
a
twig
growing
just
as
her
bending
hand
inclined
it
all
the
buds
of
his
nature
opening
out
in
the
that
surrounded
him
eleven
thirty
came
all
too
soon
then
before
long
the
kettle
would
begin
to
sing
the
potatoes
to
bubble
in
the
saucepan
and
mother
carey
spoon
to
stir
the
good
things
that
had
long
been
sizzling
quietly
in
an
iron
pot
sometimes
it
was
bits
of
beef
sometimes
mutton
but
the
result
was
mostly
a
toothsome
mixture
of
turnips
and
carrots
and
onions
in
a
sea
of
delicious
gravy
with
surprises
of
meat
here
and
there
to
vary
any
possible
monotony
once
or
twice
a
week
dumplings
appeared
giving
an
air
of
excitement
to
the
meal
and
there
was
a
delectable
poor
man
stew
learned
from
popham
the
ingredients
being
strips
of
parsnip
potatoes
cut
in
quarters
a
slice
or
two
of
sweet
browned
pork
for
a
flavor
and
a
quart
of
rich
milk
mixed
with
the
parsnip
juices
into
an
appetizing
sauce
the
after
part
of
the
dinner
would
be
a
dish
of
baked
apples
with
warm
gingerbread
or
sometimes
a
deep
apple
pandowdy
or
the
baked
indian
pudding
that
was
a
syrupy
fragrant
concoction
made
of
corn
meal
and
butter
and
molasses
baked
patiently
in
the
oven
for
hours
mother
had
the
dishes
to
wash
after
she
had
tucked
the
under
the
afghan
on
the
sitting
room
sofa
for
his
daily
nap
but
there
was
never
any
grumbling
in
her
heart
over
the
weary
days
and
the
unaccustomed
tasks
she
was
too
busy
making
things
make
themselves
if
only
there
were
a
little
more
money
that
was
her
chief
anxiety
for
the
unexpected
the
outside
sources
of
income
were
growing
fewer
and
in
a
year
time
the
little
hoard
would
be
woefully
small
was
she
doing
all
that
she
could
she
wondered
as
her
steps
flew
over
the
yellow
house
from
attic
to
cellar
she
could
play
the
piano
and
sing
she
could
speak
three
languages
and
read
four
she
had
made
her
curtsy
at
two
foreign
courts
admiration
and
love
had
followed
her
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
here
she
was
a
widow
at
forty
living
in
a
new
england
village
making
parsnip
stews
for
her
children
dinner
well
it
was
a
time
of
preparation
and
its
rigors
and
must
be
cheerfully
faced
she
ought
to
be
thankful
that
she
was
able
to
get
a
simple
dinner
that
her
children
could
eat
she
ought
to
be
thankful
that
her
beef
and
parsnip
stews
and
cracker
puddings
and
corn
bread
were
being
transmuted
into
blood
and
brawn
and
to
help
the
world
along
somewhere
a
little
later
she
ought
to
be
grateful
that
it
was
her
blessed
fortune
to
be
sending
four
rosy
laughing
vigorous
young
people
down
the
snowy
street
to
the
academy
that
it
was
her
good
luck
to
see
four
heads
bending
eagerly
over
their
books
around
the
evening
lamp
and
have
them
all
turn
to
her
for
help
and
encouragement
in
the
hard
places
why
should
she
complain
so
long
as
the
stormy
petrels
were
all
working
and
playing
in
mother
carey
water
garden
where
they
ought
to
be
gathering
strength
to
fly
over
or
dive
under
the
and
climb
shiny
wall
there
is
never
any
gate
in
the
wall
tom
the
water
baby
had
found
that
out
for
himself
so
it
is
only
the
plucky
ones
who
are
able
to
surmount
the
thousand
difficulties
they
encounter
on
their
hazardous
journey
to
peacepool
how
else
if
they
had
not
learned
themselves
could
mother
carey
chickens
go
out
over
the
seas
and
show
good
birds
the
way
home
at
such
moments
carey
would
look
at
her
image
in
the
glass
and
say
no
whimpering
madam
you
have
the
joys
of
motherhood
without
some
of
its
pangs
think
of
your
blessings
and
do
be
a
coward
who
sweeps
a
room
as
by
god
laws
makes
that
and
th
action
fine
then
her
eyes
would
turn
from
blue
velvet
to
blue
steel
and
strength
would
flow
into
her
from
some
divine
benignant
source
and
transmute
her
into
father
as
well
as
mother
was
the
hearth
fire
kindled
in
the
yellow
house
sending
its
glow
through
the
village
as
well
as
warming
those
who
sat
beside
it
there
were
christmas
and
new
year
and
valentine
parties
and
by
that
time
bill
harmon
saw
the
woodpile
in
the
carey
shed
grow
beautifully
less
he
knew
the
price
per
cord
no
man
better
but
he
and
osh
popham
winked
at
each
other
one
windy
february
day
and
delivered
three
cords
for
two
knowing
that
measurement
of
wood
had
not
been
included
in
mother
education
natty
harmon
and
digby
popham
following
examples
a
million
per
cent
better
than
parental
lectures
asked
one
afternoon
if
they
should
saw
and
chop
some
big
logs
for
the
fireplaces
carey
looked
at
them
searchingly
wondering
if
they
could
possibly
guess
the
state
of
her
finances
concluded
they
could
and
said
smilingly
indeed
i
will
gladly
let
you
saw
for
an
hour
or
two
if
you
come
and
sit
by
the
fire
on
saturday
night
when
we
are
going
to
play
spelling
games
and
have
doughnuts
and
root
beer
the
widow
berry
who
kept
academy
boarders
sent
in
a
luscious
mince
pie
now
and
then
and
popham
and
harmon
brought
dried
apples
or
pumpkins
winter
beets
and
baldwin
apples
it
was
little
enough
they
thought
when
the
yellow
house
so
long
vacant
was
like
a
beacon
light
to
the
dull
village
sending
out
its
beams
on
every
side
she
ai
no
kind
of
a
manager
i
said
bill
harmon
i
give
her
four
quarts
and
a
half
of
kerosene
for
a
gallon
every
time
she
sends
her
can
to
be
filled
but
bless
you
she
ai
any
the
wiser
i
try
to
give
her
as
good
measure
in
everything
as
she
gives
my
children
but
you
ca
keep
up
with
her
she
like
the
sun
that
shines
on
the
just
on
the
unjust
hen
lord
young
ones
eat
their
lunch
or
their
supper
there
once
or
twice
a
week
though
the
old
skinflint
got
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
never
mind
bill
said
osh
popham
there
goin
to
be
an
evenupness
somewheres
probably
god
hez
his
eye
on
that
woman
and
he
see
her
through
the
young
ones
are
growin
up
and
the
teacher
at
the
academy
says

the
devil
on
book
learnin
the
boy

a
smart
man
pretty
soon
and
bring

wages
home
to

the

handsome
enough
to

long
afore

into
marryin

an

big
strong
clumsy
lunkhead

till

end
o
the
term
well
sir
not
one
o
that
gang
stirred
in
their
seats
an
not
one
of
yipped
i
taught
school
in
my
shirt
sleeves
the
first
week
but
i
never
hed
to
afterwards
i
was
a
little
mite
weak
on
mathematics
an
the
older
boys
an
girls
hed
to
depend
on
their
study
books
for
their
information
they
never
got
any
from
me
but
every
scholar
in
that
digby
school
got
a
hundred
per
cent
in
deportment
the
nine
weeks
i
taught
there
xxx
the
inglenook
it
was
a
wild
friday
night
in
march
after
days
of
blustering
storms
and
drifting
snow
beulah
was
clad
in
royal
ermine
not
only
clad
indeed
but
nearly
buried
in
it
the
timbers
of
the
yellow
house
creaked
and
the
wreaths
of
snow
blew
against
the
windows
and
lodged
there
king
frost
was
abroad
nipping
toes
and
ears
hanging
icicles
on
the
eaves
of
houses
and
decorating
the
forest
trees
with
glittering
pendants
the
wind
howled
in
the
sitting
room
chimney
but
in
front
of
the
great
the
bed
of
live
coals
glowed
red
and
the
flames
danced
high
casting
flickering
shadows
on
the
children
faces
it
is
possible
to
bring
up
a
family
by
steam
heat
and
it
is
often
necessary
but
nobody
can
claim
that
it
is
either
so
simple
or
so
delightful
as
by
an
open
fire
the
three
cats
were
all
nestled
cosily
in
nancy
lap
or
snuggled
by
her
side
mother
carey
had
demurred
at
two
and
when
nancy
appeared
one
day
after
school
with
a
third
she
spoke
with
some
firmness
of
refusing
it
a
home
if
we
must
economize
on
cats
cried
nancy
passionately
let
begin
on
this
one
she
does
look
it
but
she
is
a
heroine
when
the
rideout
house
burned
down
her
kittens
were
in
a
basket
by
the
kitchen
stove
three
times
she
ran
in
through
the
flames
and
brought
out
a
kitten
in
her
mouth
the
tip
of
her
tail
is
gone
and
part
of
an
ear
and
she
blind
in
one
eye
harmon
says
she
too
homely
to
live
now
what
do
you
think
i
think
nobody
pretending
to
be
a
mother
could
turn
her
back
on
another
mother
like
that
said
carey
promptly
we
take
a
pint
more
milk
and
i
think
you
children
will
have
to
leave
something
in
your
plates
now
and
then
you
polish
them
until
it
really
is
indecent
an
impromptu
meeting
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
was
taking
place
by
the
sitting
room
fire
perhaps
because
the
family
plates
had
been
polished
to
a
terrifying
degree
that
week
children
said
mother
carey
we
have
been
as
economical
as
we
knew
how
to
be
we
have
worked
to
the
limit
of
our
strength
we
have
spent
almost
nothing
on
clothing
but
the
fact
remains
that
we
have
scarcely
money
enough
in
our
reserve
fund
to
last
another
six
months
what
shall
we
do
nancy
leaped
to
her
feet
scattering
cats
in
every
direction
mother
carey
she
exclaimed
remorsefully
you
have
mentioned
money
since
new
year
and
i
thought
we
were
rubbing
along
as
usual
the
bills
are
all
paid
what
the
matter
that
is
the
matter
answered
carey
with
the
suspicion
of
a
tear
in
her
laughing
voice
the
bills
paid
and
there
too
little
left
we
eat
so
much
and
we
burn
so
much
wood
and
so
many
gallons
of
oil
the
back
of
the
winter
broken
mother
dear
said
gilbert
as
a
terrific
blast
shook
the
blinds
as
a
terrier
would
a
rat
do
listen
to
that
wind
it
only
a
march
bluff
osh
popham
says
snow
is
the
poor
man
manure
he
says
it
going
to
be
an
early
season
and
a
grand
hay
crop
we
get
fifty
dollars
for
our
field
that
will
be
in
july
and
this
is
march
said
his
mother
still
the
small
reversible
van
twiller
will
carry
us
through
may
with
our
other
income
but
the
saving
days
are
over
and
the
earning
days
have
come
dears
i
am
the
oldest
and
the
biggest
i
must
begin
never
cried
nancy
you
slave
enough
for
us
as
it
is
but
you
shall
never
slave
for
anybody
else
shall
she
gilly
not
if
i
know
it
answered
gilbert
with
good
ringing
emphasis
another
winter
i
fear
we
must
close
the
yellow
house
and
the
rest
of
mother
carey
remark
was
never
heard
for
at
nancy
given
signal
the
four
younger
careys
all
swooned
on
the
floor
nancy
had
secretly
trained
peter
so
that
he
was
the
best
swooner
of
the
family
and
his
comical
imitation
of
nancy
was
so
that
mother
carey
laughed
and
declared
there
was
no
such
thing
as
talking
seriously
to
children
like
hers
but
muddy
dear
you
were
in
earnest
coaxed
nancy
bending
her
bright
head
over
her
mother
shoulder
and
cuddling
up
to
her
side
whereupon
gilbert
gave
his
imitation
of
a
jealous
puppy
barking
snarling
and
pushing
his
frowzly
pate
under
his
mother
arm
to
crowd
nancy
from
her
point
of
vantage
to
which
she
clung
valiantly
of
course
kitty
found
a
small
vacant
space
on
which
she
could
festoon
herself
and
peter
promptly
climbed
on
his
mother
lap
so
that
she
was
covered
with
fairly
submerged
in
children
a
year
ago
julia
used
to
creep
away
and
look
at
such
exhibitions
of
family
affection
with
a
curling
lip
but
at
mother
carey
outstretched
hand
and
smothered
cry
of
help
judy
she
felt
herself
gathered
into
the
heart
of
the
laughing
boisterous
group
that
hand
had
she
but
known
it
was
stretched
out
to
her
because
only
that
day
a
letter
had
come
saying
that
allan
carey
was
much
worse
and
that
his
mental
condition
admitted
of
no
cure
he
was
bright
and
hopeful
and
happy
so
said
manson
forever
sounding
the
praises
of
the
device
in
which
he
had
sunk
his
last
thousands
we
can
manufacture
it
at
ten
cents
and
sell
it
for
ten
dollars
he
would
say
rubbing
his
hands
excitedly
we
can
pay
fifty
dollars
a
month
office
rent
and
do
a
business
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
i
almost
believe
we
could
added
manson
if
we
had
faith
enough
and
capital
enough
of
course
you
know
darlings
i
would
never
leave
beulah
save
for
the
coldest
months
or
only
to
earn
a
little
money
said
carey
smoothing
her
dress
flattening
her
collar
and
pinning
up
the
braids
that
nancy
hugs
had
loosened
i
must
put
my
mind
on
the
problem
at
once
said
nancy
pacing
the
floor
i
been
so
interested
in
my
virgil
so
wrapped
up
in
my
rhetoric
and
composition
that
i
have
thought
of
ways
and
means
for
a
month
but
of
course
we
will
never
leave
the
yellow
house
and
of
course
we
must
contrive
to
earn
money
enough
to
live
in
it
we
must
think
about
it
every
spare
minute
till
vacation
comes
then
we
have
nearly
four
months
to
amass
a
fortune
big
enough
to
carry
us
through
the
next
year
i
have
an
idea
for
myself
already
i
was
going
to
wait
till
my
seventeenth
birthday
but
that
four
months
away
and
it
too
long
old
enough
to
begin
any
time
i
feel
old
enough
to
write
my
reminiscences
this
minute
you
might
publish
your
letters
to
the
american
consul
in
breslau
they
make
a
book
teased
gilbert
very
likely
i
shall
silly
gilly
retorted
nancy
swinging
her
mane
haughtily
it
is
every
girl
who
has
a
monthly
letter
from
an
admiral
in
china
and
a
consul
in
germany
you
would
catch
me
answering
the
queen
of
sheba
letters
or
the
empress
of
india
exclaimed
gilbert
whose
pen
was
emphatically
less
mighty
than
his
sword
hullo
you
two
what
are
you
whispering
about
he
called
to
kathleen
and
julia
who
were
huddled
together
in
a
far
corner
of
the
long
room
gesticulating
eloquently
we
an
idea
we
an
idea
we
found
a
way
to
help
sang
the
two
girls
pirouetting
back
into
the
circle
of
firelight
we
wo
tell
till
it
all
started
but
it
perfectly
splendid
and
practical
too
and
so
ladylike
added
julia
triumphantly
how
much
asked
gilbert
succinctly
the
girls
whispered
a
minute
or
two
and
appeared
to
be
multiplying
first
by
fifteen
and
then
again
by
twenty
from
three
dollars
and
cents
to
four
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
according
to
circumstances
answered
kathleen
proudly
will
it
take
both
of
you
yes
all
your
time
more
nods
and
whispers
and
calculation
no
indeed
only
three
hours
a
day
any
of
my
time
just
a
little
i
thought
so
said
gilbert
loftily
you
always
want
me
and
my
hammer
or
my
saw
but
i
be
busy
on
my
own
account
you
have
to
paddle
your
own
canoe
you
be
paid
for
what
you
do
for
us
said
julia
slyly
giving
kathleen
a
poke
at
which
they
both
fell
into
laughter
only
possible
to
the
very
young
then
suddenly
there
came
a
knock
at
the
front
door
a
stamping
of
feet
on
the
circular
steps
and
a
noise
of
shaking
off
snow
go
to
the
door
gilbert
who
can
that
be
on
a
night
like
this
although
it
is
only
eight
after
all
why
it
mr
thurston
ralph
thurston
came
in
blushing
and
smiling
glad
to
be
welcomed
fearful
of
intruding
afraid
of
showing
how
much
he
liked
to
be
there
all
he
said
you
see
i
could
wait
to
thank
you
carey
no
storm
could
keep
me
away
what
has
mother
been
doing
now
asked
nancy
her
right
hand
is
forever
busy
and
she
never
tells
her
left
hand
a
thing
so
we
children
are
always
in
the
dark
it
was
nothing
much
said
carey
pushing
the
young
man
gently
into
the
rocker
harmon
popham
and
i
simply
tried
to
show
our
gratitude
to
thurston
for
teaching
our
troublesome
children
how
did
you
know
it
was
my
birthday
asked
thurston
did
you
write
the
date
in
lallie
joy
book
true
i
did
and
forgot
it
long
ago
but
i
have
never
had
my
birthday
noticed
before
and
i
am
it
was
high
time
then
said
mother
carey
with
her
bright
smile
but
what
did
mother
do
clamored
nancy
kathleen
and
gilbert
in
chorus
she
took
my
forlorn
cheerless
room
and
made
it
into
a
home
for
me
said
thurston
perhaps
she
wanted
me
to
stay
in
it
a
little
more
and
bother
her
less
at
any
rate
she
has
created
an
almost
possible
rival
to
the
yellow
house
ralph
thurston
had
a
large
rather
dreary
room
over
bill
harmon
store
and
took
his
meals
at
the
widow
berry
near
by
he
was
an
orphan
and
had
no
money
to
spend
on
luxuries
because
all
his
earnings
went
to
pay
the
inevitable
debts
incurred
when
a
fellow
is
working
his
way
through
college
carey
with
the
help
of
the
other
two
women
had
seized
upon
this
stormy
friday
when
the
teacher
always
took
his
luncheon
with
him
to
the
academy
to
convert
ralph
room
into
something
comfortable
and
cheerful
the
old
cracked
stove
had
been
removed
and
bill
harmon
had
contributed
a
franklin
left
with
him
for
a
bad
debt
it
was
of
soapstone
and
had
sliding
doors
in
front
so
that
the
blaze
could
be
disclosed
when
life
was
very
dull
or
discouraging
the
straw
matting
on
the
floor
had
done
very
well
in
the
autumn
but
carey
now
covered
the
centre
of
the
room
with
a
bright
red
drugget
left
from
the
charlestown
and
hung
the
two
windows
with
curtains
of
printed
muslin
ossian
popham
had
taken
a
clotheshorse
and
covered
it
with
red
felting
so
that
the
screen
so
evolved
could
be
made
to
hide
the
bed
and
washstand
ralph
small
rickety
table
had
been
changed
for
a
big
roomy
one
of
pine
hidden
by
the
half
of
an
old
crimson
piano
cloth
when
osh
had
seen
the
effect
of
this
he
hurried
back
to
his
barn
chamber
and
returned
with
some
book
shelves
that
he
had
hastily
glued
and
riveted
into
shape
these
he
nailed
to
the
wall
and
filled
with
books
that
he
found
in
the
closet
on
the
floor
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
standing
on
the
long
mantel
shelf
do
you
care
where
you
set
nights
ossian
inquired
popham
who
was
now
in
a
state
of
uncontrolled
energy
bordering
on
delirium
because
your
rockin
chair
has
a
turkey
red
cushion
and
it
would
look
splendid
in
thurston
room
you
know
you
fiddle
half
the
time
evenin
and
you
always
go
to
bed
early
do
mind
me
exclaimed
ossian
facetiously
starting
immediately
for
the
required
chair
and
bringing
back
with
it
two
huge
yellow
sea
shells
which
he
deposited
on
the
floor
at
each
end
of
the
hearth
rug
how
do
you
like
he
inquired
of
carey
not
at
all
she
replied
promptly
you
do
he
asked
incredulously
well
it
takes
all
kinds
o
folks
to
make
a
world
i
been
keepin
fifteen
years
hopin
i
get
enough
more
to
make
a
border
for
our
parlor
fireplace
and
now
you
take
to
back
they
go
to
the
barn
chamber
maria
mis
bossin
this
job
and
she
ai
got
no
taste
for
sea
shells
would
you
like
an
old
student
lamp
i
found
one
that
i
can
bronze
up
in
about
two
minutes
if
mis
harmon
can
hook
a
shade
and
chimbly
out
of
bill
stock
they
all
stayed
in
the
room
until
this
last
feat
was
accomplished
stayed
indeed
until
the
fire
in
the
open
stove
had
died
down
to
ruddy
coals
then
they
pulled
down
the
shades
lighted
the
lamp
gave
one
last
admiring
look
and
went
home
it
had
meant
only
a
few
hours
thought
and
labor
with
scarcely
a
penny
of
expense
but
you
can
judge
what
ralph
thurston
felt
when
he
entered
the
door
out
of
the
storm
outside
to
him
it
looked
like
a
room
conjured
up
by
some
magician
in
a
fairy
tale
he
fell
into
the
and
looked
at
his
own
fire
gazed
about
at
the
cheerful
crimson
glow
that
radiated
from
the
dazzling
drugget
in
a
state
of
puzzled
ecstasy
till
he
caught
sight
of
a
card
lying
near
the
lamp
a
birthday
present
from
three
mothers
who
value
your
work
for
their
boys
and
girls
he
knew
carey
handwriting
so
he
sped
to
the
yellow
house
as
soon
as
his
supper
was
over
and
now
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
family
he
felt
and
wholly
unable
to
express
his
gratitude
it
was
bed
time
and
the
young
people
melted
away
from
the
fireside
kiss
your
mother
sweet
pete
said
nancy
taking
the
reluctant
cherub
by
the
hand
opus
hic
labor
thurston
to
get
the
upstairs
when
once
he
is
down
shake
hands
with
your
future
teacher
peter
no
you
must
kiss
him
little
boys
do
kiss
great
latin
scholars
unless
they
are
asked
thurston
laughed
and
lifted
the
gurgling
peter
high
in
the
air
good
night
old
chap
he
said
hurry
up
and
come
to
school
i
ready
now
piped
peter
i
can
read
with
the
book
upside
down
ca
i
muddy
you
can
my
son
trot
along
with
sister
thurston
opened
the
door
for
nancy
and
his
eye
followed
her
for
a
second
as
she
mounted
the
stairs
she
glowed
like
a
ruby
in
her
old
red
cashmere
the
sparkle
of
her
eye
the
gloss
of
her
hair
the
soft
red
of
her
lips
the
curve
and
bend
of
her
graceful
young
body
struck
even
her
mother
anew
though
she
was
used
to
her
beauty
she
is
growing
thought
carey
wistfully
i
see
it
all
at
once
and
soon
others
will
be
seeing
it
alas
young
ralph
thurston
had
seen
it
for
weeks
past
he
was
not
perhaps
so
much
in
love
with
nancy
the
girl
as
he
was
with
nancy
the
potential
woman
some
of
the
glamour
that
surrounded
the
mother
had
fallen
upon
the
daughter
one
felt
the
influences
that
had
rained
upon
nancy
ever
since
she
had
come
into
the
world
one
could
not
look
at
her
nor
talk
with
her
without
feeling
that
her
mother
like
a
vine
in
the
blood
as
the
old
proverb
says
was
breathing
growing
budding
blossoming
in
her
day
by
day
the
young
teacher
came
back
to
the
fireplace
where
mother
carey
was
standing
in
a
momentary
brown
study
i
never
had
you
alone
before
he
stammered
and
now
is
my
chance
to
tell
you
what
you
been
to
me
ever
since
i
came
to
beulah
you
have
helped
me
in
my
problems
more
than
i
can
possibly
have
aided
you
carey
replied
quietly
gilbert
was
so
rebellious
about
country
schools
so
patronizing
so
scornful
of
their
merits
that
i
fully
expected
he
would
never
stay
at
the
academy
of
his
own
free
will
you
have
converted
him
and
i
am
very
grateful
meantime
i
am
making
a
record
there
said
ralph
and
i
have
this
family
to
thank
for
it
your
children
with
olive
and
cyril
lord
have
set
the
pace
for
the
school
and
the
rest
are
following
to
the
best
of
their
ability
there
is
not
a
shirk
nor
a
dunce
in
the
whole
roll
of
sixty
pupils
beulah
has
not
been
so
proud
of
its
academy
for
thirty
years
and
i
shall
come
in
for
the
chief
share
in
the
praise
i
am
trying
to
do
for
gilbert
and
cyril
what
an
elder
brother
would
do
but
i
should
have
been
powerless
if
i
had
not
had
this
home
and
this
fireside
to
inspire
me
splendet
quoted
carey
pointing
to
inscription
under
the
mantelpiece
for
you
the
hearth
fire
glows
have
i
not
felt
it
from
the
beginning
asked
ralph
i
never
knew
my
mother
carey
and
few
women
have
come
into
my
life
i
have
been
too
poor
and
too
busy
to
cultivate
their
friendship
then
i
came
to
beulah
and
you
drew
me
into
your
circle
admitted
an
unknown
friendless
fellow
into
your
little
group
it
was
beautiful
it
was
wonderful
what
are
mothers
for
but
to
do
just
that
and
more
than
all
for
the
motherless
boys
well
i
may
never
again
have
the
courage
to
say
it
so
just
believe
me
when
i
say
your
influence
will
be
the
in
my
life
i
will
never
so
help
me
god
do
anything
to
make
me
unworthy
to
sit
in
this
fireglow
so
long
as
i
have
brains
and
hands
to
work
with
i
will
keep
striving
to
create
another
home
like
this
when
my
time
comes
any
girl
that
takes
me
will
get
a
better
husband
because
of
you
any
children
i
may
be
blessed
with
will
have
a
better
father
because
i
have
known
you
do
make
any
mistake
dear
carey
your
hearth
fire
glows
a
long
long
distance
mother
carey
was
moved
to
the
very
heart
she
leaned
forward
and
took
ralph
thurston
young
face
thin
with
privation
and
study
in
her
two
hands
he
bent
his
head
instinctively
partly
to
hide
the
tears
that
had
sprung
to
his
eyes
and
she
kissed
his
forehead
simply
and
tenderly
he
was
at
her
knees
on
the
hearth
rug
in
an
instant
all
his
boyish
affection
laid
at
her
feet
all
his
youthful
chivalry
kindled
at
the
honor
of
her
touch
and
there
are
women
in
the
world
who
do
not
care
about
being
mothers
xxxi
grooves
of
change
the
winter
passed
the
snow
gradually
melted
in
the
meadows
and
the
fields
which
first
grew
brown
and
then
displayed
patches
of
green
here
and
there
where
the
sun
fell
strongest
there
was
deep
sticky
mud
in
the
roads
and
the
discouraged
farmers
urged
their
horses
along
with
the
wheels
of
their
wagons
sunk
to
the
hub
in
ooze
then
there
were
wet
days
the
wind
ruffling
the
leaden
surface
of
the
river
the
sound
of
the
rain
dripping
from
the
bare
the
smell
of
the
wet
grass
and
the
clean
thirsty
soil
milder
weather
came
then
blustery
days
then
chill
damp
ones
but
steadily
life
grew
here
there
everywhere
and
the
miracle
of
the
awakening
earth
took
place
once
again
sap
mounted
in
the
trees
blood
coursed
in
the
children
veins
mothers
began
giving
herb
tea
and
sulphur
and
molasses
young
human
nature
was
restless
the
whole
creation
throbbed
and
sighed
and
was
tremulous
and
had
growing
pains
april
passed
with
all
its
varying
moods
of
sun
and
shower
and
settled
weather
came
all
the
earth
was
gay
land
and
sea
gave
themselves
up
to
jollity
and
with
the
heart
of
may
did
every
beast
keep
holiday
the
carey
girls
had
never
heard
of
the
joy
of
living
as
a
phrase
but
oh
they
knew
a
deal
about
it
in
these
first
two
heavenly
springs
in
little
beulah
village
the
sunrise
was
so
wonderful
the
trees
and
grass
so
marvellously
green
the
wild
flowers
so
beautiful
then
the
river
on
clear
days
the
glimpse
of
the
sea
from
beulah
hill
tops
the
walks
in
the
pine
woods
could
paradise
show
anything
to
compare
and
how
good
the
food
tasted
and
the
books
they
read
how
fresh
how
moving
how
glorious
then
when
the
happy
day
was
over
sleep
came
without
pause
or
effort
the
moment
the
flushed
cheek
touched
the
cool
pillow
these
nancy
reflected
quoting
from
her
favorite
wordsworth
as
she
dressed
beside
her
open
window
these
must
be
the
gifts
of
morn
ere
life
grows
noisy
and
thought
can
overtake
the
rapture
of
the
sense
i
was
fifteen
and
a
half
last
spring
and
now
though
it
is
only
a
year
ago
everything
is
different
she
mused
when
did
it
get
to
be
different
i
wonder
it
never
was
all
at
once
so
it
must
have
been
a
little
every
day
so
little
that
i
hardly
noticed
it
until
just
now
a
young
girl
heart
is
ever
yearning
for
and
trembling
at
the
future
in
its
innocent
depths
the
things
that
are
to
be
are
sometimes
rustling
and
whispering
secrets
and
sometimes
keeping
an
exquisite
haunting
silence
in
the
midst
of
the
mystery
the
solemn
young
creature
is
sighing
to
herself
what
am
i
meant
for
am
i
everything
am
i
nothing
must
i
wait
till
my
future
comes
to
me
or
must
i
seek
it
this
was
all
like
the
sound
of
a
still
small
voice
in
nancy
mind
but
it
meant
that
she
was
growing
up
taking
hold
on
life
at
more
points
than
before
seeing
new
visions
dreaming
new
dreams
kathleen
and
julia
seemed
ridiculously
young
to
her
she
longed
to
advise
them
but
her
sense
of
humor
luckily
kept
her
silent
gilbert
appeared
crude
raw
promising
but
undeveloped
she
hated
to
think
how
much
experience
he
would
have
to
pass
through
before
he
could
see
existence
as
it
really
was
and
as
she
herself
saw
it
olive
older
view
of
things
her
sad
strange
outlook
upon
life
her
dislike
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
man
her
melancholy
aversion
to
her
father
all
this
fascinated
and
puzzled
nancy
whose
impetuous
nature
ran
out
to
every
living
thing
revelling
in
the
very
act
of
loving
so
long
as
she
did
not
meet
rebuff
cyril
perplexed
her
silent
unresponsive
shy
she
would
sometimes
raise
her
eyes
from
her
book
in
school
and
find
him
gazing
steadily
at
her
like
a
timid
deer
drinking
thirstily
at
a
spring
nancy
did
not
like
cyril
but
she
pitied
him
and
was
as
friendly
with
him
in
her
offhand
boyish
fashion
as
she
was
with
every
one
the
last
days
of
the
academy
term
were
close
at
hand
and
the
air
was
full
of
graduation
exercises
and
white
muslin
and
ribbon
sashes
june
brought
two
surprises
to
the
yellow
house
one
morning
kathleen
burst
into
nancy
room
with
the
news
nancy
the
fergusons
offer
to
adopt
judy
and
she
does
want
to
go
think
of
that
but
she
afraid
to
ask
mother
if
she
can
stay
let
us
do
it
shall
we
i
will
but
of
course
there
is
not
enough
money
to
go
around
kitty
even
if
we
all
succeed
in
our
vacation
plans
julia
will
never
have
any
pretty
dresses
if
she
stays
with
us
and
she
loves
pretty
dresses
why
did
the
fergusons
adopt
her
before
mother
had
made
her
over
yes
chimed
in
kathleen
then
everybody
would
have
been
glad
but
now
we
shall
miss
her
think
of
missing
judy
we
would
never
have
believed
it
it
like
seeing
how
a
book
turns
out
to
watch
her
priggishness
and
smuggishness
all
melting
away
nancy
said
i
should
like
to
see
her
slip
back
into
the
old
judyisms
and
neither
would
mother
probably
keep
her
for
i
know
manson
thinks
it
only
a
matter
of
a
few
months
before
uncle
allan
dies
and
mother
would
want
a
carey
to
grow
up
into
an
imitation
gladys
ferguson
but
that
what
judy
would
be
in
course
of
time
julia
took
ferguson
letter
herself
to
her
aunt
margaret
showing
many
signs
of
perturbation
in
her
usually
tranquil
face
carey
read
it
through
carefully
it
is
a
very
kind
generous
offer
julia
your
father
can
not
be
consulted
about
it
so
you
must
decide
you
would
have
every
luxury
and
your
life
would
be
full
of
change
and
pleasure
while
with
us
it
must
be
in
the
nature
of
things
busy
and
frugal
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
i
am
one
more
to
feed
and
clothe
aunt
margaret
and
there
is
so
little
money
i
know
but
you
are
one
more
to
help
after
all
the
days
are
soon
coming
when
nancy
and
gilbert
will
be
out
in
the
world
helping
themselves
you
and
kathleen
could
stay
with
peter
and
me
awaiting
your
turn
it
does
look
attractive
in
comparison
with
what
the
fergusons
offer
you
then
the
gentle
little
rivers
that
had
been
swelling
all
the
past
year
in
julia
heart
rivers
of
tenderness
and
gratitude
and
sympathy
suddenly
overflowed
their
banks
and
running
hither
and
thither
softened
everything
with
which
they
came
in
contact
rocky
places
melted
barren
spots
waked
into
life
and
under
the
impulse
of
a
new
mood
that
she
scarcely
understood
julia
cried
oh
dear
aunt
margaret
keep
me
keep
me
this
is
home
i
never
want
to
leave
it
i
want
to
be
one
of
mother
carey
chickens
the
child
had
flung
herself
into
the
arms
that
never
failed
anybody
and
with
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
made
her
plea
there
there
judy
dear
you
are
one
of
us
and
we
could
not
let
you
go
unless
you
were
to
gain
something
by
it
if
you
really
want
to
stay
we
shall
love
you
all
the
better
and
you
will
belong
to
us
more
than
you
ever
did
so
dry
your
eyes
or
you
will
be
somebody
duckling
instead
of
my
chicken
the
next
surprise
was
a
visit
from
cousin
ann
chadwick
who
drove
up
to
the
door
one
morning
quite
unannounced
and
asked
the
driver
of
the
depot
wagon
to
bring
over
her
two
trunks
immediately
two
trunks
groaned
gilbert
that
means
the
whole
season
but
it
meant
nothing
of
the
kind
it
meant
pretty
white
dresses
for
the
three
girls
two
pairs
of
stockings
and
two
of
gloves
for
the
whole
family
a
pattern
of
black
silk
for
carey
and
numberless
small
things
to
which
the
carey
wardrobe
had
long
been
a
stranger
having
bestowed
these
offerings
rather
grimly
as
was
her
wont
and
having
received
the
family
grateful
acknowledgments
with
her
usual
lack
of
grace
she
proceeded
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
to
make
herself
far
more
disagreeable
than
had
been
the
case
on
any
previous
visit
of
her
life
she
had
never
seen
such
dusty
roads
as
in
beulah
so
many
mosquitoes
and
flies
such
tough
meat
such
a
lack
of
fruit
such
talkative
neighbors
such
a
dull
minister
such
an
inattentive
doctor
such
extortionate
tradesmen
what
shall
we
do
with
cousin
ann
exclaimed
carey
to
nancy
in
despair
she
makes
us
these
generous
presents
yet
she
can
not
possibly
have
any
affection
for
us
we
accept
them
without
any
affection
for
her
because
we
hardly
know
how
to
avoid
it
the
whole
situation
is
positively
degrading
i
have
borne
it
for
years
because
she
was
good
to
your
father
when
he
was
a
boy
but
now
that
she
has
grown
so
much
more
difficult
i
really
think
i
must
talk
openly
with
her
she
talked
openly
enough
with
me
when
i
confessed
that
gilbert
and
i
had
dropped
and
broken
the
dirty
boy
said
nancy
and
she
has
been
very
cross
with
me
ever
since
cousin
ann
said
carey
that
afternoon
on
the
piazza
it
is
very
easy
to
see
that
you
do
not
approve
of
the
way
we
live
or
the
way
we
think
about
things
in
general
feeling
as
you
do
i
really
wish
you
would
not
spend
your
money
on
us
and
give
us
these
beautiful
and
expensive
presents
it
puts
me
under
an
obligation
that
chafes
me
and
makes
me
unhappy
i
do
disapprove
of
you
particularly
said
miss
chadwick
do
i
act
as
if
i
did
your
manner
seems
to
suggest
it
you
ca
tell
much
by
manners
replied
cousin
ann
i
think
entirely
too
soft
and
sentimental
but
we
all
have
our
faults
i
think
you
have
any
right
to
feed
the
neighbors
and
burn
up
fuel
and
oil
in
their
behalf
when
you
have
got
enough
for
your
own
family
i
think
you
ought
to
have
had
four
children
and
having
had
them
you
have
taken
another
one
in
though
she
turned
out
better
than
i
expected
but
all
that
is
none
of
my
business
i
suppose
and
as
you
are
i
like
you
better
than
most
folks
which
saying
much
but
if
you
do
share
my
way
of
thinking
why
do
you
keep
fretting
yourself
to
come
and
see
us
it
only
annoys
you
it
annoys
me
but
i
ca
help
coming
somehow
i
guess
i
hate
other
places
and
other
ways
worse
than
i
do
yours
you
do
grudge
me
bed
and
board
i
suppose
how
could
i
grudge
you
anything
when
you
give
us
so
much
so
much
more
than
we
ought
to
accept
so
much
more
than
we
can
ever
thank
you
for
i
do
want
to
be
thanked
you
know
that
well
enough
but
there
so
much
demonstration
in
your
family
you
ca
understand
anybody
keeping
themselves
exclusive
i
do
like
to
fuss
over
people
or
have
them
fuss
over
me
kissing
comes
as
easy
to
you
as
eating
but
i
never
could
abide
it
a
nasty
common
habit
i
call
it
i
want
to
give
what
i
like
and
where
and
when
i
like
and
act
as
i
a
mind
to
afterwards
i
do
give
because
i
see
things
are
needed
but
because
i
ca
spend
my
income
unless
i
do
give
if
i
could
have
my
way
i
buy
you
a
good
house
in
buffalo
right
side
of
mine
take
your
beggarly
little
income
and
manage
it
for
you
build
a
barbed
wire
fence
round
the
lot
so
the
neighbors
could
get
in
and
eat
you
out
of
house
and
home
and
in
a
couple
of
years
i
could
make
something
out
of
your
family
carey
put
down
her
sewing
leaned
her
head
back
against
the
crimson
rambler
and
laughed
till
the
welkin
rang
i
suppose
you
think
i
crazy
cousin
ann
remarked
after
a
pause
i
do
know
cousin
ann
said
carey
taking
up
her
work
again
whatever
it
is
you
ca
help
it
if
you
give
up
trying
to
understand
my
point
of
view
i
wo
meddle
with
yours
i
suppose
you
wo
come
to
buffalo
no
indeed
thank
you
cousin
ann
you
stay
here
in
this
benighted
village
and
grow
old
you
that
are
a
handsome
woman
of
forty
and
might
have
a
millionaire
husband
to
take
care
of
you
my
husband
had
money
enough
to
please
me
and
when
i
meet
him
again
and
show
him
the
four
children
he
will
be
the
richest
man
in
paradise
cousin
ann
rose
i
going
and
i
sha
be
back
this
year
i
taken
passage
on
a
steamer
that
leaving
for
liverpool
next
week
going
abroad
alone
cousin
ann
no
with
a
party
of
cook
tourists
what
a
strange
idea
exclaimed
carey
i
do
see
why
everybody
been
abroad
i
do
expect
to
like
the
way
they
live
over
there
but
if
other
folks
can
stand
it
i
guess
i
can
it
amuse
me
for
a
spell
maybe
and
if
it
do
i
got
money
enough
to
break
away
and
do
as
i
a
mind
to
the
last
evening
was
a
pleasant
friendly
one
every
carey
doing
his
or
her
best
to
avoid
risky
subjects
and
to
be
as
agreeable
as
possible
cousin
ann
chadwick
left
next
day
and
carey
bidding
the
strange
creature
was
almost
sorry
that
she
had
ever
had
any
arguments
with
her
it
will
be
so
long
before
i
see
you
again
cousin
ann
i
was
on
the
point
of
kissing
you
till
i
remembered
she
said
with
a
smile
as
she
stood
at
the
gate
i
do
know
as
i
mind
for
once
said
miss
chadwick
if
got
to
kiss
me
i
rather
it
would
be
you
than
anybody
she
drove
away
her
two
empty
trunks
in
the
back
of
the
wagon
she
sailed
for
liverpool
the
next
week
and
accompanied
her
chosen
party
to
the
cathedral
towns
of
england
there
in
a
quiet
corner
of
york
minster
as
the
boy
choir
was
chanting
its
anthems
her
heart
an
organ
she
had
never
been
conscious
of
possessing
gave
one
brief
sudden
physical
pang
and
she
passed
out
of
what
she
had
called
life
neither
her
family
affairs
nor
the
names
of
her
relations
were
known
and
the
news
of
her
death
did
not
reach
beulah
till
more
than
two
months
afterward
and
with
it
came
the
knowledge
that
cousin
ann
chadwick
had
left
the
income
of
five
thousand
dollars
to
each
of
the
five
carey
children
with
five
thousand
to
be
paid
in
cash
to
mother
carey
on
the
settlement
of
the
estate
xxxii
doors
of
daring
little
the
careys
suspected
how
their
fortunes
were
mending
during
those
last
days
of
june
had
they
known
they
might
almost
have
been
disappointed
for
the
spur
of
need
was
already
pricking
them
and
their
valiant
young
spirits
longed
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
fray
plans
had
been
formed
for
the
past
week
many
of
them
in
secret
and
the
very
next
day
after
the
close
of
the
academy
various
business
projects
would
burst
upon
a
waiting
world
one
sunday
night
mother
carey
had
read
to
the
little
group
a
poem
in
which
there
was
a
verse
that
struck
on
their
ears
with
a
fine
spirit
and
all
the
bars
at
which
we
fret
that
seem
to
prison
and
control
are
but
the
doors
of
daring
set
ajar
before
the
soul
they
recited
it
over
and
over
to
themselves
afterwards
and
two
or
three
of
them
wrote
it
down
and
pinned
it
to
the
wall
or
tucked
it
in
the
frame
of
the
looking
glass
olive
lord
knocked
at
her
father
study
door
the
morning
of
the
of
june
walking
in
quietly
she
said
father
yesterday
was
my
seventeenth
birthday
mother
left
me
a
letter
to
read
on
that
day
telling
me
that
i
should
have
fifty
dollars
a
month
of
my
own
when
i
was
seventeen
cyril
to
have
as
much
when
he
is
the
same
age
if
you
had
waited
courteously
and
patiently
for
a
few
days
you
would
have
heard
this
from
me
her
father
answered
i
could
be
sure
olive
replied
you
never
did
notice
a
birthday
why
should
you
begin
now
i
have
more
important
matters
to
take
up
my
mind
than
the
consideration
of
trivial
dates
her
father
answered
you
know
that
very
well
and
you
know
too
that
notwithstanding
my
absorbing
labors
i
have
endeavored
for
the
last
few
months
to
give
more
of
my
time
to
you
and
cyril
i
realize
that
or
i
should
not
speak
to
you
at
all
said
olive
it
is
because
you
have
shown
a
little
interest
in
us
lately
that
i
consult
you
i
want
to
go
at
once
to
boston
to
study
painting
i
will
deny
myself
everything
else
if
necessary
but
i
will
go
and
i
will
study
it
is
the
only
life
i
care
for
the
only
life
i
am
likely
to
have
and
i
am
determined
to
lead
it
you
must
see
that
you
are
too
young
to
start
out
for
yourself
anywhere
it
is
simply
impossible
i
shall
not
be
alone
carey
will
find
me
a
good
home
in
charlestown
with
friends
of
hers
you
trust
her
judgment
if
no
one
else
if
she
is
charitable
enough
to
conduct
your
foolish
enterprises
as
well
as
those
of
her
own
children
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
have
talked
with
her
frequently
and
she
knows
that
as
soon
as
i
have
finished
my
last
volume
i
shall
be
able
to
take
a
more
active
interest
in
your
affairs
and
cyril
then
may
i
go
when
i
hear
from
the
person
in
charlestown
yes
there
is
an
expedition
starting
for
south
america
in
a
few
months
and
i
have
been
asked
to
accompany
the
party
if
you
are
determined
to
leave
home
i
shall
be
free
to
accept
the
invitation
perhaps
carey
would
allow
cyril
to
stay
with
her
during
my
absence
i
dare
say
and
i
advise
you
to
go
to
south
america
by
all
means
you
will
be
no
farther
away
from
your
family
than
you
have
always
been
with
this
parting
shot
olive
lord
closed
the
study
door
behind
her
that
girl
has
the
most
unpleasant
disposition
and
the
sharpest
tongue
i
ever
met
in
the
course
of
my
life
said
henry
lord
to
himself
as
he
turned
to
his
task
mother
carey
magic
was
working
very
slowly
in
his
blood
it
had
roused
him
a
little
from
the
bottomless
pit
of
his
selfishness
but
much
mischief
had
been
done
on
all
sides
and
it
would
be
a
work
of
time
before
matters
could
be
materially
mended
olive
nature
was
already
warped
and
embittered
and
it
would
require
a
deal
of
sunshine
to
make
a
plant
bloom
that
had
been
so
dwarfed
by
neglect
and
indifference
nancy
door
of
daring
opened
into
an
editorial
office
an
hour
here
an
hour
there
when
the
yellow
house
was
asleep
had
brought
about
a
story
that
was
on
its
way
to
a
distant
city
it
was
written
with
incredible
care
on
one
side
of
the
paper
only
it
enclosed
a
fully
stamped
envelope
for
a
reply
or
a
return
of
the
manuscript
and
all
day
long
nancy
trembling
between
hope
and
despair
went
about
hugging
her
first
secret
to
her
heart
gilbert
had
opened
his
own
particular
door
and
if
it
entailed
no
more
daring
than
that
of
nancy
effort
it
required
twice
the
amount
of
he
was
to
be
from
june
till
august
bill
harmon
clerk
and
delivery
boy
and
the
first
that
the
family
would
know
about
it
would
be
his
arrival
at
the
back
door
in
a
linen
jacket
with
an
in
his
hand
bravo
gilly
one
can
see
your
heels
disappearing
over
the
top
of
shiny
wall
the
door
of
daring
just
ready
to
be
opened
by
kathleen
and
julia
was
of
a
truly
dramatic
and
unexpected
character
printed
in
plain
letters
circulars
reposed
in
the
folds
of
julia
nightdresses
in
her
lower
bureau
drawer
the
last
thing
to
be
done
at
night
and
the
first
in
the
morning
was
the
stealthy
whispered
reading
of
one
of
these
documents
lest
even
after
the
hundredth
time
something
wrong
should
suddenly
appear
to
the
eye
or
ear
they
were
addressed
they
were
stamped
and
they
would
be
posted
to

the

prepared
for

to

academy
at
special
prices
meantime
the
honorable
lemuel
hamilton
had
come
to
america
and
was
opening
doors
of
daring
at
such
a
rate
of
speed
that
he
hardly
realized
the
extent
of
his
own
courage
and
what
it
involved
he
accepted
an
official
position
of
considerable
honor
and
distinction
in
washington
rented
a
house
there
and
cabled
his
wife
and
younger
daughter
to
come
over
in
september
he
wrote
his
elder
daughter
that
she
might
go
with
some
friends
to
honolulu
if
she
would
return
for
christmas
eleven
years
since
we
had
a
christmas
tree
he
added
and
the
first
thing
you
know
we
shall
have
lost
the
habit
to
his
son
jack
in
texas
he
expressed
himself
as
so
encouraged
by
the
last
business
statement
which
showed
a
decided
turn
for
the
better
that
he
was
willing
to
add
a
thousand
dollars
to
the
capital
and
irrigate
some
more
of
the
unimproved
land
on
the
ranch
if
jack
has
really
got
hold
out
there
he
can
come
home
every
two
or
three
years
he
thought
well
perhaps
i
shall
succeed
in
getting
part
of
them
together
part
of
the
time
if
i
work
hard
enough
all
but
tom
whom
i
care
most
about
now
that
everything
is
in
train
i
take
a
little
vacation
myself
and
go
down
to
beulah
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
those
careys
if
i
had
ever
contemplated
returning
to
america
i
suppose
i
should
have
allowed
them
to
settle
down
in
the
old
house
still
eleanor
would
never
have
been
content
to
pass
her
summers
there
so
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
the
was
too
young
to
greatly
dare
still
it
ought
perhaps
to
be
set
down
that
he
sold
three
dozen
marbles
and
a
new
kite
to
billy
harmon
that
summer
and
bought
his
mother
a
birthday
present
with
the
money
all
peter
doors
of
daring
had
hitherto
opened
into
places
from
which
he
issued
weeping
with
sprained
ankles
bruised
hands
skinned
knees
or
burned
eyelashes
xxxiii
mother
hamilton
birthday
it
was
the
fourth
of
july
a
hot
still
day
when
one
could
fairly
see
the
green
peas
swelling
in
their
pods
and
the
string
beans
climbing
their
poles
like
acrobats
young
beulah
had
rung
the
church
bell
at
midnight
cast
its
torpedoes
to
earth
in
the
early
morning
flung
its
under
the
horses
feet
and
felt
somewhat
relieved
of
its
superfluous
patriotism
by
breakfast
time
then
there
was
a
parade
of
antiques
and
horribles
accompanied
by
the
beulah
band
which
though
not
as
antique
was
fully
as
horrible
as
anything
in
the
procession
from
that
time
on
the
day
had
been
somnolent
enlivened
in
the
carey
household
only
by
the
solemn
rite
of
paying
the
annual
rent
of
the
yellow
house
the
votive
nosegay
had
been
carefully
made
up
and
laid
lovingly
by
nancy
under
mother
hamilton
portrait
in
the
presence
not
only
of
the
entire
family
but
also
of
osh
popham
who
had
called
to
present
early
radishes
and
peppergrass
i
like
to
go
upstairs
with
you
when
you
get
your
boquet
tied
up
he
said
because
it
an
awful
hot
day
an
the
queer
kind
o
things
you
do
this
house
allers
makes
my
backbone
cold
i
never
suspicioned
that
lena
hamilton
hed
the
same
kind
o
fantasmic
notions
that
you
folks
have
but
i
guess
it
like
tenant
like
landlord
in
this
case
anyhow
i
want
to
see
the
rent
paid
if
you
do
mind
i
you
asked
that
mean
old
sculpin
of
a
hen
lord
over
he
owns
my
house
an
it
might
put
a
few
idees
into
his
head
in
the
afternoon
nancy
took
her
writing
pad
and
sat
on
the
circular
steps
where
it
was
cool
the
five
train
from
boston
whistled
at
the
station
a
mile
away
as
she
gathered
her
white
skirts
daintily
up
and
settled
herself
in
the
shadiest
corner
she
was
unconscious
of
the
passing
time
and
scarcely
looked
up
until
the
rattling
of
wheels
caught
her
ear
it
was
the
station
wagon
stopping
at
the
yellow
house
gate
and
a
strange
gentleman
was
alighting
he
had
an
unmistakable
air
of
the
town
his
clothes
were
not
as
beulah
clothes
and
his
hat
was
not
as
beulah
hats
for
it
was
a
fine
panama
with
a
broad
sweeping
brim
nancy
rose
from
the
steps
surprise
dawning
first
in
her
eyes
then
wonder
then
suspicion
then
conviction
then
two
dimples
appeared
in
her
cheeks
the
stranger
lifted
the
hat
with
a
smile
and
said
my
little
friend
and
correspondent
nancy
carey
i
think
my
american
consul
i
do
believe
cried
nancy
joyously
as
she
ran
down
the
path
with
both
hands
outstretched
where
did
you
come
from
why
did
you
tell
us
beforehand
we
never
even
heard
that
you
were
in
this
country
oh
i
know
why
you
chose
the
fourth
of
july
it
pay
day
and
you
thought
we
should
be
ready
with
the
rent
but
it
all
attended
to
beautifully
this
morning
may
i
send
my
bag
to
the
mansion
house
and
stay
a
while
with
you
asked
hamilton
are
the
rest
of
you
at
home
how
are
gilbert
and
kathleen
and
julia
and
peter
how
especially
is
mother
carey
what
a
memory
you
have
exclaimed
nancy
take
hamilton
bag
please
bennett
and
tell
them
at
the
hotel
that
he
wo
be
there
until
after
supper
it
was
a
pleasant
hour
that
ensued
for
nancy
had
broken
the
ice
and
there
was
plenty
of
conversation
then
too
the
whole
house
had
to
be
shown
room
by
room
even
to
cousin
ann
stove
in
the
cellar
and
the
pump
in
the
kitchen
sink
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
exclaimed
hamilton
it
is
like
magic
i
ought
to
pay
you
a
thousand
dollars
on
the
spot
i
ought
to
try
and
buy
the
place
of
you
for
five
thousand
why
do
you
go
into
the
business
of
recreating
houses
and
selling
them
to
poor
benighted
creatures
like
me
who
never
realize
their
possibilities
if
we
show
you
the
painted
chamber
will
you
promise
not
to
be
too
unhappy
asked
nancy
you
ca
help
crying
with
rage
and
grief
that
it
is
our
painted
chamber
not
yours
but
try
to
bear
up
until
you
get
to
the
hotel
because
mother
is
so
she
will
be
giving
it
back
to
you
unless
i
interfere
you
must
have
spent
money
lavishly
when
you
restored
this
room
said
the
consul
it
is
a
real
work
of
art
not
a
penny
said
carey
it
is
the
work
of
a
great
friend
of
nancy
a
girl
who
we
expect
will
make
beulah
famous
some
day
now
will
you
go
into
your
mother
room
and
find
your
way
downstairs
by
yourself
julia
will
you
show
hamilton
the
barn
a
little
later
while
nancy
and
i
get
supper
kitty
must
go
to
the
pophams
for
peter
he
is
spending
the
afternoon
with
them
nancy
had
enough
presence
of
mind
to
intercept
kitty
and
hiss
into
her
ear
borrow
a
loaf
of
bread
from
popham
we
are
short
and
see
if
you
can
find
any
way
to
get
strawberries
from
bill
harmon
it
was
to
have
been
a
supper
on
the
piazza
and
it
must
be
hurriedly
changed
into
a
consular
banquet
fly
gilbert
turned
up
a
little
before
six
and
was
introduced
proudly
by
his
mother
as
a
son
who
had
just
gone
into
business
i
bill
harmon
summer
clerk
and
delivery
boy
he
explained
great
fun
and
i
get
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
nancy
and
her
mother
worked
like
trojans
in
the
kitchen
for
they
agreed
it
was
no
time
for
economy
even
if
they
had
less
to
eat
for
a
week
to
come
hamilton
is
just
as
nice
as
i
guessed
he
was
when
his
first
letter
came
said
nancy
i
went
upstairs
to
get
a
card
for
the
supper
menu
and
he
was
standing
by
your
mantelpiece
with
his
head
bent
over
his
arms
he
had
the
little
bunch
of
field
flowers
in
his
hand
and
i
know
he
had
been
smelling
them
and
looking
at
his
mother
picture
and
remembering
things
what
a
merry
supper
it
was
with
a
jug
of
susans
in
the
centre
of
the
table
and
a
written
bill
of
fare
for
hamilton
because
he
was
a
consul
so
nancy
said
gilbert
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
hamilton
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
carey
in
her
lavender
challie
sitting
behind
the
tea
cups
unless
it
was
nancy
flushed
like
a
rose
changing
the
plates
and
waiting
on
the
table
between
courses
he
had
never
exerted
himself
so
much
at
any
diplomatic
dinner
and
he
won
the
hearts
of
the
entire
family
before
the
meal
was
finished
by
the
way
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
you
all
but
especially
to
miss
nancy
here
and
i
have
never
thought
to
deliver
it
he
said
who
do
you
think
sent
it
all
the
way
from
china
my
son
tom
exclaimed
nancy
irrepressibly
but
no
he
could
because
he
does
know
us
the
admiral
of
course
cried
gilbert
you
are
both
right
hamilton
answered
drawing
a
letter
from
his
coat
pocket
it
is
a
round
robin
from
the
admiral
and
my
son
tom
who
have
been
making
acquaintance
in
hong
kong
it
is
addressed
from
the
yellow
peril
in
china
to
the
yellow
house
in
beulah
nancy
crimsoned
did
the
admiral
tell
your
son
tom
i
called
him
the
yellow
peril
it
was
wicked
of
him
i
did
it
you
know
because
you
wrote
me
that
the
only
hamilton
who
cared
anything
for
the
old
house
or
would
ever
want
to
live
in
it
was
your
son
tom
after
that
i
always
called
him
the
yellow
peril
and
i
suppose
i
mentioned
it
in
a
letter
to
the
admiral
i
am
convinced
that
nancy
mind
is
always
empty
at
bedtime
said
her
mother
because
she
tells
everything
in
it
to
somebody
during
the
day
i
hope
age
will
bring
discretion
but
i
doubt
it
my
son
tom
is
coming
home
said
his
father
with
unmistakable
delight
in
his
voice
nancy
who
was
passing
the
cake
sat
down
so
heavily
in
her
chair
that
everybody
laughed
come
come
miss
nancy
i
ca
let
you
make
an
ogre
of
the
boy
urged
hamilton
he
is
a
fine
fellow
and
if
he
comes
down
here
to
look
at
the
old
place
you
are
sure
to
be
good
friends
is
he
going
back
to
china
after
his
visit
asked
carey
who
felt
a
fear
of
the
young
man
something
akin
to
her
daughter
no
i
am
glad
to
say
our
family
has
been
too
widely
separated
for
the
last
ten
years
at
first
it
seemed
necessary
or
at
least
convenient
and
desirable
and
i
did
not
think
much
about
it
but
lately
it
has
been
continually
on
my
mind
that
we
were
leading
a
cheerless
existence
and
i
am
determined
to
arrange
matters
differently
carey
remembered
ossian
popham
description
of
lemuel
hamilton
and
forebore
to
ask
any
questions
with
regard
to
her
whereabouts
since
her
husband
did
not
mention
her
you
will
all
be
in
washington
then
she
said
and
your
son
tom
with
you
of
course
not
quite
so
near
as
that
his
father
replied
tom
firm
is
opening
a
boston
office
and
he
will
be
in
charge
of
that
when
do
you
expect
the
admiral
back
tom
talks
of
their
coming
together
on
the
bedouin
if
it
can
be
arranged
we
have
heard
lately
said
carey
but
he
should
return
within
a
month
or
two
should
he
not
nancy
my
daughter
writes
all
the
letters
for
the
family
hamilton
as
you
know
by
this
time
i
do
to
my
great
delight
and
satisfaction
now
there
is
one
thing
i
have
not
seen
yet
something
about
which
i
have
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
may
i
smoke
my
cigar
under
the
famous
crimson
rambler
the
sun
set
flaming
red
behind
the
beulah
hills
the
frogs
sang
in
the
pond
by
the
house
of
lords
and
the
grasshoppers
chirped
in
the
long
grass
of
mother
hamilton
favorite
hayfield
then
the
moon
round
and
as
a
great
mandarin
orange
came
up
into
the
sky
from
which
the
sun
had
faded
and
the
little
group
still
sat
on
the
side
piazza
talking
nothing
but
their
age
and
size
kept
the
carey
chickens
out
of
hamilton
lap
and
peter
finally
went
to
sleep
with
his
head
against
the
consul
knee
he
was
a
lappy
man
nancy
said
next
morning
and
indeed
there
had
been
no
one
like
him
in
the
family
circle
for
many
a
long
month
he
was
tender
he
was
gay
he
was
fatherly
he
was
interested
in
all
that
concerned
them
so
no
wonder
that
he
heard
all
about
gilbert
plans
for
earning
money
and
nancy
accepted
story
no
wonder
he
exclaimed
at
the
check
for
ten
dollars
proudly
exhibited
in
payment
and
no
wonder
he
marvelled
at
the
summer
vacation
school
in
the
barn
where
fourteen
little
scholars
were
already
enrolled
under
the
tutelage
of
the
carey
faculty
i
never
wanted
to
go
to
anything
in
my
life
as
much
as
i
want
to
go
to
that
school
he
asserted
if
i
could
write
a
circular
as
enticing
as
that
i
should
be
a
rich
man
i
wish
you
let
me
have
some
new
ones
printed
girls
and
put
me
down
for
three
evening
lectures
i
do
almost
anything
to
get
into
that
faculty
i
wish
you
give
the
lectures
for
the
benefit
of
the
faculty
that
would
be
better
still
said
kitty
nancy
party
was
to
be
in
the
barn
this
summer
that
one
of
the
things
earning
money
for
or
at
least
we
make
believe
that
it
is
because
so
much
more
fun
to
work
for
a
party
than
for
coal
or
flour
or
meat
a
look
from
carey
prevented
the
children
from
making
any
further
allusions
to
economy
and
gilbert
skillfully
turned
the
subject
by
giving
a
dramatic
description
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
dirty
boy
from
its
first
appearance
at
his
mother
wedding
breakfast
to
its
last
at
the
supper
after
lemuel
hamilton
had
gone
back
to
the
little
country
hotel
he
sat
by
the
open
window
for
another
hour
watching
the
moonbeams
shimmering
on
the
river
and
bathing
the
tip
of
the
white
steeple
in
a
flood
of
light
the
air
was
still
and
the
fireflies
were
rising
above
the
thick
grass
and
carrying
their
fairy
lamps
into
the
lower
branches
of
the
feathery
elms
haying
would
begin
next
morning
and
he
would
be
wakened
by
the
sharpening
of
scythes
and
the
click
of
mowing
machines
he
would
like
to
work
in
the
hamilton
fields
he
thought
in
daisies
fields
on
whose
grass
he
had
not
stepped
since
he
was
a
boy
just
big
enough
to
go
behind
the
cart
and
rake
after
what
an
evening
it
had
been
none
of
them
had
known
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
all
scaled
shiny
wall
and
had
been
sitting
with
mother
carey
in
peacepool
that
was
what
had
made
everything
so
beautiful
hamilton
last
glimpse
of
the
careys
had
been
the
group
at
the
yellow
house
gate
carey
with
her
brown
hair
shining
in
the
moonlight
leaned
against
gilbert
the
girls
stood
beside
her
their
arms
locked
in
hers
while
peter
clung
sleepily
to
her
hand
i
believe
they
are
having
hard
times
he
thought
and
i
ca
think
of
anything
i
can
safely
do
to
make
things
easier
still
one
can
not
pity
one
can
only
envy
them
that
is
the
sort
of
mother
i
would
have
made
had
i
been
nature
and
given
a
free
hand
i
would
have
put
a
label
on
carey
saying
is
what
i
meant
a
woman
to
be

nancy
comes
out
nancy
seventeenth
birthday
was
past
and
it
was
on
the
full
of
the
august
moon
that
she
finally
came
out
in
the
hamilton
barn
it
was
the
barn
first
public
appearance
too
for
the
villagers
had
not
been
invited
to
the
private
saturday
night
dances
that
took
place
during
the
brief
reign
of
the
hamilton
boys
and
girls
beulah
was
more
excited
about
the
barn
than
it
was
about
nancy
and
she
was
quite
in
sympathy
with
this
view
of
things
as
the
entire
carey
family
from
mother
to
peter
was
fairly
bewitched
with
its
new
toy
day
by
day
it
had
grown
more
enchanting
as
fresh
ideas
occurred
to
one
or
another
and
especially
to
osh
popham
who
lived
breathed
and
had
his
being
in
the
barn
and
who
had
lavished
his
ingenuity
and
skill
upon
its
fittings
not
a
word
did
he
vouchsafe
to
the
general
public
of
the
extraordinary
nature
of
these
fittings
nor
of
the
many
bewildering
features
of
the
entertainment
which
was
to
take
place
within
the
almost
sacred
precincts
all
the
carey
festivities
had
heretofore
been
in
the
house
save
the
one
in
honor
of
the
hanging
of
the
weather
vane
which
had
been
an
function
attended
by
the
whole
village
now
the
community
was
all
agog
to
disport
itself
in
pastures
new
its
curiosity
being
further
piqued
by
the
reception
of
written
invitations
a
convention
not
often
indulged
in
by
beulah
the
eventful
day
dawned
clear
and
cool
a
day
with
an
air
like
liquid
amber
that
properly
belonged
to
september
the
weather
prophet
really
shifting
it
into
august
from
pure
kindness
having
taken
a
sticky
dogday
out
and
pitchforked
it
into
the
next
month
the
afternoon
passed
in
various
stages
of
plotting
planning
and
palpitation
and
every
girl
in
beulah
of
dancing
age
was
in
her
bedroom
trying
her
hair
a
new
way
the
excitement
increased
a
thousand
fold
when
it
was
rumored
that
an
admiral
whatever
that
might
be
had
arrived
at
the
hotel
and
would
appear
at
the
barn
in
full
uniform
after
that
nobody
braids
or
puffs
would
go
right
nancy
never
needed
to
study
paris
plates
for
her
hair
dressed
itself
after
a
fashion
set
by
all
the
venuses
and
cupids
and
little
loves
since
the
world
began
it
curled
whether
she
would
or
no
so
the
only
method
was
to
part
the
curls
and
give
them
a
twist
into
a
coil
from
which
vagrant
spirals
fell
to
the
white
nape
of
her
neck
or
if
she
felt
gay
and
coquettish
as
she
did
tonight
the
curls
were
pinned
high
to
the
crown
of
her
head
and
the
runaways
rioted
here
and
there
touching
her
cheek
her
ear
her
neck
never
ugly
wherever
they
ran
nancy
had
a
new
yellow
organdy
made
almost
to
touch
and
a
twist
of
yellow
ribbon
in
her
hair
kathleen
and
julia
were
in
the
white
dresses
brought
them
by
cousin
ann
and
carey
wore
her
new
black
silk
made
with
a
sweeping
little
train
her
wedding
necklace
of
seed
pearls
was
around
her
neck
and
a
tall
comb
of
tortoise
shell
and
pearls
rose
from
the
knot
of
her
shining
hair
the
family
received
in
the
old
carriage
house
and
when
everybody
had
assembled
to
the
number
of
or
eighty
the
door
into
the
barn
was
thrown
open
majestically
by
gilbert
in
his
character
as
head
of
the
house
of
carey
words
fail
to
describe
the
impression
made
by
the
barn
as
it
was
introduced
to
the
company
nancy
debut
sinking
into
positive
insignificance
beside
it
dozens
of
brown
japanned
hung
from
the
beamed
ceiling
dispensing
little
twinkles
of
light
here
and
there
while
larger
ones
swung
from
harness
pegs
driven
into
the
sides
of
the
walls
the
soft
of
the
old
weathered
lumber
everywhere
made
a
lovely
background
for
the
brackets
and
the
white
vases
that
were
filled
with
early
mixed
with
tall
queen
lace
and
golden
glow
the
quaint
settles
surrounding
the
sides
of
the
room
were
speedily
filled
by
the
admiring
guests
colonel
wheeler
tiny
upright
piano
graced
the
platform
in
the
tie
up
miss
susie
bennett
the
church
organist
was
to
play
it
aided
now
and
then
by
carey
or
julia
osh
popham
was
to
take
turns
on
the
violin
with
a
cousin
from
warren
mills
who
was
reported
to
be
the
master
fiddler
of
the
county
when
all
was
ready
carey
stood
between
the
master
fiddler
and
susie
bennett
and
there
was
a
sudden
hush
in
the
room
friends
and
neighbors
she
said
we
now
declare
the
hall
of
happy
hours
open
for
the
general
good
of
the
village
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
generosity
of
our
landlord
lemuel
hamilton
we
could
never
have
given
you
this
pleasure
and
had
not
our
helpers
been
so
many
we
could
never
have
made
the
place
so
beautiful
before
the
general
dancing
begins
there
will
be
a
double
quadrille
of
honor
in
which
all
those
will
take
part
who
have
driven
a
nail
papered
or
painted
a
wall
dug
a
spadeful
of
earth
or
done
any
work
in
or
about
the
yellow
house
three
cheers
for
mrs
carey
called
bill
harmon
and
everybody
complied
lustily
three
cheers
for
lemuel
hamilton
and
the
rafters
of
the
barn
rang
with
the
response
just
then
the
admiral
changed
his
position
to
conceal
the
moisture
that
was
beginning
to
gather
in
his
eyes
and
the
sight
of
a
personage
so
unspeakably
magnificent
in
a
naval
uniform
induced
osh
popham
to
cry
spontaneously
three
cheers
for
the
admiral
i
do
know
what
he
ever
done
but
he
looks
as
if
he
could
all
right
at
which
everybody
cheered
and
roared
and
the
admiral
to
his
great
surprise
made
a
speech
during
which
the
telltale
tears
appeared
so
often
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
voice
that
osh
popham
concluded
privately
that
if
the
naval
hero
ever
did
meet
an
opposing
battleship
he
would
be
likelier
to
drown
the
enemy
than
fire
into
them
the
double
quadrille
of
honor
passed
off
with
much
elegance
everybody
not
participating
in
it
being
green
with
envy
because
he
was
not
carey
and
the
admiral
were
partners
nancy
danced
with
popham
kathleen
with
digby
julia
with
bill
harmon
the
other
couples
were
popham
and
gilbert
lallie
joy
and
cyril
lord
olive
and
nat
harmon
while
bill
led
out
a
very
shy
and
uncomfortable
gentleman
who
had
dug
the
ditches
for
cousin
ann
expensive
pipes
then
the
fun
and
the
frolic
began
in
earnest
the
girls
had
been
practising
the
contra
dances
all
summer
and
training
the
younger
generation
in
them
at
the
vacation
school
the
old
folks
needed
no
rehearsal
if
you
had
waked
any
of
them
in
the
night
suddenly
they
could
have
called
the
changes
for
speed
the
plough
the
soldier
joy
the
maid
in
the
pump
room
or
hull
victory
money
musk
brought
nancy
and
henry
lord
on
to
the
floor
as
head
couple
a
result
attained
by
that
young
lady
by
every
means
fair
or
foul
known
to
woman
at
least
a
rudimentary
budding
woman
of
seventeen
summers
his
coming
to
the
party
at
all
was
regarded
by
mother
carey
who
had
spent
the
whole
force
of
her
being
in
managing
it
as
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
he
had
accepted
partly
from
secret
admiration
of
his
handsome
neighbor
partly
to
show
the
village
that
he
did
not
choose
always
to
be
a
hermit
crab
partly
out
of
curiosity
to
see
the
unusual
gathering
having
crawled
out
of
his
selfish
shell
far
enough
to
grace
the
occasion
he
took
another
step
when
nancy
asked
him
to
dance
it
was
pretty
to
see
her
curtsey
when
she
put
the
question
pretty
to
see
the
air
of
triumph
with
which
she
led
him
to
the
head
of
the
line
and
positively
delightful
to
the
onlookers
to
see
hen
lord
doing
right
and
left
ladies
chain
balance
to
opposite
and
cast
off
at
a
girl
beck
and
call
he
was
not
a
bad
dancer
when
his
sluggish
blood
once
got
into
circulation
and
he
was
considerably
more
limber
at
the
end
of
money
musk
considerably
less
like
a
wooden
image
than
at
the
beginning
of
it
in
the
interval
between
this
astounding
exhibition
and
the
rochester
schottisch
which
followed
it
henry
lord
went
up
to
carey
who
was
sitting
in
a
corner
a
little
apart
from
her
guests
for
the
moment
shall
i
go
to
south
america
or
shall
i
not
he
asked
her
in
an
undertone
olive
seems
pleasantly
settled
and
cyril
tells
me
you
will
consent
to
take
him
into
your
family
for
six
months
still
i
would
like
a
woman
advice
mother
carey
neither
responded
i
should
prefer
not
to
take
the
responsibility
of
advising
you
nor
pray
do
as
you
think
best
she
simply
said
in
a
tone
she
might
have
used
to
a
fractious
boy
i
would
go
lord
wait
till
olive
and
cyril
are
a
little
older
cyril
will
grow
into
my
family
instead
of
into
his
own
olive
will
learn
to
do
without
you
worse
yet
you
will
learn
to
do
without
your
children
stay
at
home
and
have
olive
come
back
to
you
and
her
brother
every
week
end
south
america
is
a
long
distance
when
there
are
only
three
of
you
lord
was
not
satisfied
with
carey
tone
it
was
so
maternal
that
he
expected
at
any
moment
she
might
brush
his
hair
straighten
his
necktie
and
beg
him
not
to
sit
up
too
late
but
his
instinct
told
him
it
was
the
only
tone
he
was
ever
likely
to
hear
from
her
and
so
he
said
reluctantly
very
well
i
confess
that
i
really
rely
on
your
judgment
and
i
will
decline
the
invitation
i
think
you
are
right
carey
answered
wondering
if
the
man
would
ever
see
his
duty
with
his
own
eyes
or
whether
he
had
deliberately
blinded
himself
for
life
xxxv
the
crimson
rambler
while
carey
was
talking
with
lord
nancy
skimmed
across
the
barn
floor
intent
on
some
suddenly
remembered
duty
went
out
into
the
garden
and
met
face
to
face
a
strange
young
man
standing
by
the
rose
trellis
and
looking
in
at
the
dance
through
the
open
door
he
had
on
a
conventional
black
something
never
seen
in
beulah
and
wore
a
soft
travelling
cap
at
first
nancy
thought
he
was
a
friend
of
the
visiting
fiddler
but
a
closer
look
at
his
merry
dark
eyes
gave
her
the
feeling
that
she
had
seen
him
before
or
somebody
very
like
him
he
did
not
wait
for
her
to
speak
but
taking
off
his
cap
put
out
his
hand
and
said
by
your
resemblance
to
a
photograph
in
my
possession
i
think
you
are
the
girl
who
planted
the
crimson
rambler
are
you
son
tom
asked
nancy
open
astonishment
in
her
tone
i
mean
my
hamilton
son
tom
i
am
hamilton
son
tom
or
shall
we
say
hamilton
do
two
make
one
upon
my
word
wonders
will
never
cease
exclaimed
nancy
the
admiral
said
you
were
in
boston
but
he
never
told
us
you
would
visit
beulah
so
soon
no
i
wanted
it
to
be
a
secret
i
wanted
to
appear
when
the
ball
was
at
its
height
the
ghost
of
the
old
regime
confronting
the
new
so
to
speak
beulah
will
soon
be
a
summer
resort
everybody
seems
to
be
coming
here
it
partly
your
fault
is
it
why
pray
water
babies
is
one
of
my
favorite
books
and
i
know
all
about
mother
carey
chickens
they
go
out
over
the
seas
and
show
good
birds
the
way
home
are
a
good
bird
asked
nancy
saucily
i
at
all
events
said
tom
with
an
emphasis
that
made
nancy
shiver
lest
the
young
man
had
come
to
beulah
with
a
view
of
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
paternal
mansion
the
two
young
people
sat
down
on
the
piazza
steps
while
the
music
of
the
sultan
polka
floated
out
of
the
barn
door
old
jenks
was
dancing
with
peter
her
steps
as
fleet
as
his
her
white
bobbing
to
the
tune
her
withered
hands
clasped
his
dimpled
ones
and
the
two
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
age
for
in
the
atmosphere
of
laughter
and
goodwill
there
would
have
been
no
place
for
the
old
in
heart
and
certainly
jenks
was
as
young
as
any
one
at
the
party
i
ca
help
dreading
you
nice
and
amiable
as
you
look
said
nancy
candidly
to
tom
hamilton
i
am
so
afraid
you
fall
in
love
with
the
yellow
house
and
want
it
back
again
are
you
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
china
doll
or
anything
like
that
she
asked
with
a
teasing
upward
look
and
a
disarming
smile
that
robbed
the
question
of
any
rudeness
no
not
engaged
to
anything
or
anybody
but
i
a
notion
i
shall
be
soon
if
all
goes
well
i
getting
along
in
years
now
i
might
have
known
it
sighed
nancy
it
was
a
prophetic
instinct
my
calling
you
the
yellow
peril
it
is
a
bit
nice
of
you
to
dislike
me
before
you
know
me
i
do
that
way
with
you
what
do
you
mean
why
in
the
first
letter
you
ever
wrote
father
you
sent
your
love
to
any
of
his
children
that
should
happen
to
be
of
the
right
size
i
chanced
to
be
the
right
size
so
i
accepted
it
gratefully
got
it
here
with
me
no
i
left
it
in
my
other
coat
he
said
merrily
making
a
fictitious
search
through
his
pockets
nancy
laughed
at
his
nonsense
she
could
not
help
it
will
you
promise
to
get
over
your
foolish
and
wicked
prejudices
if
i
on
my
part
promise
never
to
take
the
yellow
house
away
from
you
unless
you
wish
continued
tom
willingly
exclaimed
nancy
joyously
that
the
safest
promise
i
could
make
for
i
would
never
give
up
living
in
it
unless
i
had
to
first
it
was
father
choice
then
it
was
mother
now
all
of
us
seem
to
have
built
ourselves
into
it
as
it
were
i
am
almost
afraid
to
care
so
much
about
anything
and
i
shall
be
so
relieved
if
you
do
not
turn
out
to
be
really
a
yellow
peril
after
all
you
are
much
more
of
a
yellow
peril
yourself
said
tom
with
that
dress
and
that
ribbon
in
your
hair
will
you
dance
the
next
dance
with
me
please
it
the
tempest
do
you
know
it
no
but
i
not
so
old
but
i
may
learn
i
form
myself
on
that
wonderful
person
who
makes
jokes
about
the
admiral
and
plays
the
fiddle
that
ossian
popham
principal
prop
of
the
house
of
carey
lucky
dog
have
you
got
all
the
props
you
need
nancy
hand
was
not
old
or
strong
or
experienced
enough
to
keep
this
strange
young
man
in
order
and
just
as
she
was
meditating
some
blighting
retort
he
went
on
who
is
that
altogether
adorable
that
unspeakably
beautiful
lady
in
black
the
one
with
the
pearl
comb
that
looks
like
a
crown
that
mother
said
nancy
glowing
i
thought
so
at
least
i
did
know
any
other
way
to
account
for
her
why
does
she
have
to
be
accounted
for
asked
nancy
a
little
bewildered
for
the
same
reason
that
you
do
said
the
audacious
youth
you
explain
your
mother
and
your
mother
explains
you
a
little
at
any
rate
where
is
the
celebrated
crimson
rambler
please
you
are
sitting
on
it
nancy
answered
tranquilly
tom
sprang
away
from
the
trellis
on
which
he
had
been
half
reclining

soul
he
exclaimed

me

a
great
affection
for

rambler
it
was
your
planting
it
that
first
made
me
think
favorably
of

this
light

top
somewhere

window

laughed
nancy

to
be
depended
on
said
tom
rebukingly
just
give
me
your
hand
a
moment
step
on
that
lowest
rung
of
the
trellis
now
one
step
higher

right
hand

little
cluster

that
right

careful

thank

rose

the
morning

button

nancy

is
the
last
i
gave

father
one
of
the
first
a
month
ago
i
shall
put
this
in
my
pocket
book
and
send
it
to
my
mother
in
a
letter
tom
replied
and
tell
her
it
looks
just
like
the
girl
who
planted
it
he
thought
sweet
fragrant
spicy
graceful
vigorous
full
of
color
now
come
in
and
meet
mother
said
nancy
the
polka
is
over
and
soon
they
will
be
on
for
the
tempest
tom
hamilton
entrance
and
introduction
proved
so
interesting
that
it
delayed
the
dance
for
a
few
moments
then
osh
popham
and
the
master
fiddler
tuned
their
violins
and
carey
assisted
susie
bennett
at
the
piano
so
that
there
were
four
musicians
to
give
fresh
stimulus
to
the
impatient
feet
tom
hamilton
hardly
knew
whether
he
would
rather
dance
with
nancy
or
stand
at
the
open
door
and
watch
her
as
he
had
been
doing
earlier
in
the
evening
he
could
not
really
see
her
now
although
he
was
her
partner
his
mind
was
so
occupied
with
the
intricate
figures
but
he
could
feel
her
in
every
fibre
of
his
body
the
touch
of
her
light
hand
was
so
charged
with
magnetism
somebody
swung
the
back
doors
of
the
barn
wide
open
the
fields
lately
mown
sloped
gently
up
to
a
fringe
of
pines
darkly
green
against
the
sky
the
cool
night
air
stirred
the
elms
and
the
brilliant
moon
appeared
in
the
very
centre
of
the
doorway
the
beauty
of
the
whole
scene
went
to
tom
hamilton
head
a
little
but
he
kept
his
thoughts
steadily
on
the
changes
as
osh
popham
called
them
to
watch
nancy
carey
dance
the
tempest
was
a
sight
to
stir
the
blood
the
two
head
couples
joined
hands
and
came
down
the
length
of
the
barn
four
abreast
back
they
went
in
a
whirl
then
they
balanced
to
the
next
couple
then
came
four
hands
round
and
ladies
chain
and
presently
they
came
down
again
flying
with
another
four
behind
them
the
first
four
were
nancy
and
tom
ralph
thurston
and
kathleen
the
last
two
among
the
best
dancers
in
beulah
but
while
kitty
was
slim
and
straight
and
graceful
as
a
young
fawn
nancy
swept
down
the
middle
of
the
barn
floor
like
a
flower
borne
by
the
breeze
she
was
youth
hope
joy
incarnate
she
had
washed
the
dishes
that
night
would
wash
them
again
in
the
morning
but
what
of
that
what
mattered
it
that
the
years
just
ahead
for
aught
she
knew
to
the
contrary
were
full
of
and
economy
was
she
not
seventeen
anything
was
possible
at
seventeen
what
if
the
world
was
to
be
a
world
there
was
music
and
laughter
in
it
as
well
as
work
and
there
was
love
in
it
too
oceans
of
love
so
why
not
trip
and
be
merry
and
guide
one
young
partner
safely
through
the
difficult
mazes
of
the
dance
and
bring
him
out
flushed
and
triumphant
to
receive
mother
laughing
compliments
everybody
was
dancing
the
tempest
in
his
or
her
own
fashion
thought
the
admiral
looking
on
popham
was
grave
even
gloomy
from
the
waist
up
but
incredibly
lively
from
the
waist
down
moving
with
the
precision
of
machinery
while
her
partner
a
bricklayer
from
beulah
centre
engaged
the
attention
of
the
entire
company
by
his
wonderful
steps
she
was
fully
up
to
time
too
you
may
be
sure
as
her
rival
bill
harmon
was
opposite
her
in
the
set
lallie
joy
clad
in
one
of
kathleen
dresses
her
hair
dressed
by
julia
was
a
daily
attendant
at
the
vacation
school
but
five
weeks
of
steady
instruction
had
not
sufficed
to
make
her
sure
of
ladies
grand
chain
olive
moved
like
a
shy
little
wild
thing
with
a
bending
head
and
a
grace
all
her
own
while
gilbert
had
great
ease
and
distinction
there
was
a
brief
interval
for
ice
cream
accompanied
by
marble
cake
gold
cake
silver
cake
election
cake
sponge
cake
cup
cake
citron
cake
and
white
mountain
cake
and
while
it
was
being
eaten
susie
bennett
played
the
sliding
waltz
the
maiden
prayer
and
listen
to
the
mocking
bird
with
variations
variations
requiring
almost
supernatural
celerity
i
guess
there
ai
many
that
can
touch
sutey
at
the
piano
said
osh
popham
who
sat
beside
the
admiral
have
you
seen
anybody
in
the
cities
that
could
play
any
she
can
and
jo
you
ever
ketch
her
on
a
black
note
when
she
started
for
a
white
one
i
guess
not
you
are
right
replied
the
admiral
and
now
there
seems
to
be
a
general
demand
for
you
what
are
they
requesting
you
to
do
fly
that
it
said
osh
mis
carey
will
you
play
for
me
maria
you
can
go
into
the
carriage
house
if
you
do
want
to
be
disgraced
come
my
beloved
haste
away
cut
short
the
hours
of
thy
delay
fly
like
a
youthful
hart
or
roe
over
the
hills
where
spices
grow
at
length
the
strains
of
the
favorite
old
tune
faded
on
the
ears
of
the
delighted
audience
then
they
had
the
portland
fancy
and
the
irish
washerwoman
and
the
college
hornpipe
and
at
last
the
clock
in
the
carriage
house
struck
midnight
and
the
guests
departed
in
groups
of
twos
and
threes
and
fours
their
cheerful
voices
sounding
far
down
the
village
street
osh
popham
stayed
behind
to
cover
the
piano
put
out
the
lanterns
close
the
doors
and
windows
and
lock
the
barn
while
carey
and
the
admiral
strolled
slowly
along
the
greensward
to
the
side
door
of
the
house
osh
called
happily
as
he
passed
them
a
few
minutes
later
i
guess
beulah
never
see
a
party
such
as
ourn
was
this
evenin
i
guess
if
the
truth
was
known
the
state
o
maine
never
did
neither
all
mebbe
if
i
hurry
along
i
can
ketch
up
with
maria
his
quick
steps
brushing
the
grassy
pathway
could
be
heard
for
some
minutes
in
the
clear
still
air
and
presently
the
sound
of
his
mellow
tenor
came
floating
back
come
my
beloved
haste
away
cut
short
the
hours
of
thy
delay
fly
like
a
youthful
hart
or
roe
over
the
hills
where
spices
grow
julia
had
gone
upstairs
with
the
sleepy
who
had
been
enjoying
his
first
experience
of
late
hours
on
the
occasion
of
coming
out
the
rest
of
the
young
folks
were
gathered
in
a
group
under
the
elms
chatting
in
couples
olive
and
ralph
thurston
kathleen
and
cyril
lord
nancy
and
tom
hamilton
then
they
parted
tom
hamilton
strolling
to
the
country
hotel
with
the
young
school
teacher
for
companion
while
olive
and
cyril
walked
across
the
fields
to
the
house
of
lords
it
was
a
night
in
a
thousand
the
air
was
warm
clear
and
breathlessly
still
so
still
that
not
a
leaf
stirred
on
the
trees
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
the
moon
brilliant
and
luminous
shone
as
it
seldom
shines
in
a
northern
clime
the
water
was
low
in
beulah
shining
river
and
it
ran
almost
noiselessly
under
the
bridge
while
kathleen
and
julia
were
still
unbraiding
their
hair
exclaiming
at
every
twist
of
the
hand
as
to
the
loveliness
of
the
party
nancy
had
kissed
her
mother
and
crept
silently
into
bed
all
night
long
the
strains
of
the
tempest
ran
through
her
dreams
there
was
the
touch
of
a
strange
hand
on
hers
an
altogether
new
touch
warm
and
compelling
there
was
the
gay
trooping
down
the
centre
of
the
barn
in
fours
some
one
by
her
side
who
had
never
been
there
before
and
a
sensation
entirely
new
and
intoxicating
that
whenever
she
met
the
glance
of
her
partner
merry
dark
eyes
she
found
herself
at
the
bottom
of
them
was
she
a
child
when
she
heard
osh
popham
cry
take
your
partners
for
the
tempest
and
was
she
a
woman
when
he
called
all
promenade
to
seats
she
hardly
knew
beulah
was
a
dream
the
yellow
house
was
a
dream
the
dance
was
a
dream
the
partner
was
a
dream
at
one
moment
she
was
a
child
helping
her
father
to
plant
the
crimson
rambler
at
another
she
was
a
woman
pulling
a
rose
from
the
topmost
branch
and
giving
it
to
some
one
who
steadied
her
hand
on
the
trellis
some
one
who
said
thank
you
and
differently
from
the
rest
of
the
world
who
was
the
young
stranger
was
he
the
knight
of
beulah
castle
the
overlord
of
the
yellow
house
was
he
the
yellow
peril
was
he
a
good
bird
to
whom
mother
carey
chicken
had
shown
the
way
home
still
the
dream
went
on
in
bewildering
circles
and
nancy
kept
hearing
mysterious
phrases
spoken
with
a
new
meaning
will
you
dance
with
me
the
house
of
carey
need
another
prop
wo
you
give
me
a
rose
and
above
all
you
sent
your
love
to
any
one
of
the
hamilton
children
who
should
be
of
the
right
size
i
was
just
the
right
size
and
i
took
it
love
could
be
sent
in
a
letter
expostulated
nancy
in
the
dream
and
somebody
in
the
dream
always
answered
do
be
so
sure
very
strange
things
happen
when
mother
carey
messengers
go
out
over
the
seas
do
you
remember
how
they
spoke
to
tom
in
water
babies
among
all
the
songs
that
came
across
the
water
one
was
more
sweet
and
clear
than
all
for
it
was
the
song
of
a
young
voice
and
what
was
the
song
that
she
sung
have
patience
keep
your
eye
single
and
your
hands
clean
and
you
will
learn
some
day
to
sing
it
yourself
without
needing
any
man
to
teach
you
