above

of
villas
some
still
white
with

and
the
latest
unadorned
by
more
than
tendrils
of
ampelopsis
or
rambling
roses
the
downs
bent
their
bow
to
the
sky
the
horizon
loomed
so
smooth
and
vast
that
the
plantations
of
pine
and
beech
which
fringed
the
summits
were
powerless
to
break
the
nobility
and
purpose
of
its
contour
etched
against
the
hem
of
a
that
was
of
the
colour
of
ink
between
the
banks
a
chalk
road
climbed
an
aspiring
road
felted
in
the
trodden
parts
with
dust
but
with
flinty
gutters
through
which
rain
poured
like
london
milk
in
stormy
weather
a
smell
of
hot
earth
was
in
the
air
the
turf
at
the
wayside
was
parched
and
slippery
so
that
edwin
ingleby
plodding
up
the
slope
was
forced
to
keep
to
the
white
roadway
by
the
slipperiness
of
his
a
rather
pitiful
figure
he
made
this
small
boy
in
an
eton
jacket
his
waistcoat
now
unbuttoned
and
his
school
cap
crumpled
in
his
hot
hands
he
walked
and
ran
straight
upward
as
though
the
devil
were
at
his
heels
sometimes
looking
behind
him
to
see
if
there
were
any
one
in
pursuit
sometimes
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
with
the
crumpled
cap
a
wagonette
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
and
burdened
with
trippers
jolted
past
him
throwing
up
a
cloud
of
that
made
his
eyes
smart
inside
it
swayed
seven
fat
women
in
black
bodices
the
guard
who
was
sufficiently
sober
in
his
own
opinion
to
ride
on
the
step
was
seen
to
laugh
at
the
boy
in
the
road
lamb
said
the
most
motherly
of
the
seven
like
a
lift
the
hopposite
way
mem
said
the
guard
of
them
college
looks
said
the
lady
to
rine
kets
and
dorgs
edwin
ingleby
rubbed
the
dust
out
of
or
into
his
eyes
and
went
plugging
on
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
where
the
road
dipped
through
a
belt
of
beeches
into
the
trough
between
two
billows
of
down
losing
itself
within
high
banks
of
turf
which
bordered
the
satiny
now
with
bearded
wheat
and
infinitely
restful
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
with
his
feet
in
the
gutter
and
began
to
mop
up
tears
with
the
cap
that
he
had
lately
used
for
mopping
up
sweat
all
the
time
that
he
was
crying
his
heart
was
really
full
of
almost
incontinent
valour
and
that
was
why
his
tears
made
him
angry
he
began
talking
to
himself
beast
great
beefy
if
only
the
men
could
see
what
a
damned
beast
he
is
if
layton
or
some
one
could
give
him
what
he
wants
only
no
one
could
fight
got
a
weak
heart
and
it
might
kill
him
i
suppose
that
would
be
murder
the
word
suddenly
got
a
new
significance
they
called
this
road
cross
road
high
up
in
the
grassy
bank
some
pious
person
had
cut
a
cross
to
commemorate
the
murder
of
a
postman
who
had
been
relieved
of
his
bags
and
his
life
on
a
dark
night
a
century
ago
the
college
tradition
said
that
it
was
haunted
certainly
it
had
an
ugly
sound
cross
road
a
name
to
be
whispered
said
edwin
nothing
very
awful
about
it
i
could
understand
a
chap
wanting
to
murder
a
chap
quite
easily
only
he
might
be
sorry
about
it
afterwards
i
mind
murdering
he
took
a
silver
watch
out
of
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
bank
beside
him
he
could
see
that
there
was
a
full
hour
to
spare
before
the
bell
in
the
water
tower
would
jangle
for
the
evening
in
the
corner
of
the
quad
and
so
he
lay
back
easily
on
the
bank
stretching
out
his
legs
and
arms
in
the
form
of
the
cross
scored
in
the
hedge
a
little
farther
on
lying
thus
he
could
watch
the
shimmer
on
the
bearded
wheat
he
had
always
loved
the
softness
of
this
dip
in
the
downs
he
had
loved
it
on
winter
mornings
delicately
dusted
with
rime
in
november
when
flints
lay
like
a
bloom
on
the
pale
fallow
in
march
when
the
bloom
turned
green
now
the
had
rolled
away
rumbling
from
the
south
and
a
breath
of
cooler
air
was
moving
through
the
valley
throwing
the
surface
of
that
green
sea
into
motion
the
waves
shuddered
faintly
and
the
sound
came
to
his
ears
as
though
from
the
heavy
woods
which
stood
still
in
the
heat
bounding
the
green
ripples
and
lying
there
with
his
eyes
edwin
was
already
afloat
bearing
westward
with
the
set
of
the
tide
in
the
track
of
cortes
and
columbus
and
pizarro
and
other
adventurous
voyagers
it
was
not
really
very
difficult
for
him
to
forget
his
tears
although
the
fear
of
griffin
that
had
first
driven
him
afield
was
a
cruel
obsession
to
which
he
was
liable
by
night
and
day
he
had
long
ago
discovered
that
silence
and
solitude
could
make
him
free
of
any
wonder
which
he
chose
to
imagine
it
had
been
like
that
even
when
he
was
quite
little
he
had
always
possessed
the
faculty
of
and
now
that
his
imagination
was
beginning
to
flush
at
the
sound
of
great
names
and
the
pomps
of
chivalry
and
legend
were
slowly
unfolding
before
him
with
their
subtle
suggestiveness
unhampered
by
such
knowledge
of
detail
as
would
be
alive
to
incongruities
his
idleness
became
daily
more
precious
he
suddenly
remembered
that
achaean
assembly
stirred
by
words
when
the
west
wind
cometh
to
stir
a
deep
cornfield
with
violent
blast
and
the
ears
bow
down
and
now
the
wheat
bent
like
a
stricken
army
before
knightly
lances
and
the
roll
of
retreating
thunder
awoke
echoes
of
the
guns
of
ii
it
was
nearly
three
years
since
edwin
had
first
seen
griffin
oddly
enough
on
the
very
first
day
of
his
life
at
ingleby
had
come
down
from
the
midlands
with
him
a
little
anxious
for
there
were
pitfalls
in
public
school
life
it
was
in
but
immensely
proud
of
entrance
scholarship
they
had
crossed
london
together
in
a
hansom
and
on
the
smoky
platform
at
victoria
she
had
bidden
him
a
which
cost
her
some
pangs
for
the
poor
boy
was
half
dead
with
edwin
was
her
only
child
and
some
smouldering
ethic
decreed
that
he
must
not
be
pampered
but
when
she
raised
her
veil
to
kiss
him
tears
escaped
beneath
its
rim
those
tears
were
very
unsettling
they
gave
him
a
sudden
glimpse
of
his
mother
in
a
new
light
but
he
felt
too
ill
even
to
watch
her
hurrying
to
the
end
of
the
platform
his
head
ached
so
violently
in
the
sulphurous
station
air
that
he
have
minded
much
if
some
one
say
his
neighbour
in
the
train
a
city
clerk
who
smoked
the
most
manly
tobacco
had
relieved
him
of
the
the
last
gift
of
all
that
he
clutched
mechanically
in
his
trouser
if
the
porters
in
the
fine
free
way
they
have
had
smashed
all
the
jampots
in
the
playbox
so
obstrusively
white
and
new
with
ingleby
in
black
lettering
on
the
lid
the
rest
of
that
journey
he
had
been
too
prostrate
and
lethargic
to
realise
somewhere
the
shouting
of
a
familiar
word
had
bundled
him
out
of
his
corner
a
porter
whom
he
had
tipped
fumblingly
had
bundled
him
into
a
cab
which
smelt
of
straw
and
at
last
the
personage
who
received
him
at
the
grand
entrance
had
conveyed
him
up
a
broad
flight
of
stone
stairs
and
along
a
corridor
that
echoed
their
two
pairs
of
to
the
room
where
in
an
atmosphere
of
mellow
honeydew
selby
sat
at
his
desk
trifling
with
a
of
the
big
dormitory
ingleby
sat
at
one
end
of
a
luxurious
sofa
feeling
very
sick
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
never
escape
from
the
smell
of
tobacco
at
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
sat
another
boy
perhaps
three
years
older
than
edwin
he
was
tall
for
his
age
and
inclined
to
be
fat
his
feet
were
small
and
shapely
and
their
smallness
accentuated
the
heavy
build
of
his
shoulders
so
that
the
whole
boy
seemed
to
taper
downwards
on
the
lines
of
a
he
had
a
broad
face
covered
with
freckles
regular
but
undistinguished
features
and
eyes
rather
wide
apart
of
a
peculiar
cold
and
light
blue
his
hair
was
crisp
and
sandy
his
whole
a
little
dandiacal
within
the
limits
of
black
and
gray
he
kept
on
fingering
silver
coins
that
jingled
together
faintly
in
the
depths
of
his
pocket
perhaps
he
was
counting
them
in
the
dark
perhaps
he
was
merely
fidgeting
selby
looked
up
from
his
griffin
and
what
is
your
pleasure
from
father
a
letter
from
father
would
need
an
answer
selby
although
an
expert
in
the
tortuous
psychology
of
parents
was
a
lazy
man
he
sighed
as
he
opened
it
no
games
you
look
particularly
ill
said
i
was
growing
too
fast
sir
something
about
my
manners
were
irreproachable
selby
smiled
well
griffin
very
well
i
will
speak
to
the
about
you
and
who
is
this
miserable
weed
there
had
been
no
break
in
the
drawl
of
voice
with
this
change
of
subject
and
edwin
did
not
hear
or
heard
without
understanding
griffin
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
he
lurched
forward
like
a
creature
coming
out
of
a
cellar
into
day
light
sir
he
said
oh
yes
let
me
see
you
need
to
take
the
placing
exam
because
of
your
scholarship
papers
be
in
the
lower
fourth
so
griffin
will
look
after
you
do
you
hear
griffin
i
think
ingleby
will
be
in
your
form
you
are
not
overwhelmingly
likely
to
get
a
move
are
you
griffin
murmured
you
can
conduct
this
ingleby
to
d
dormitory
griffin
whispered
on
and
walked
ahead
down
the
length
of
the
corridor
and
another
flight
of
stairs
to
a
room
of
immense
length
with
whitewashed
walls
along
which
were
ranged
as
many
as
thirty
beds
down
the
centre
of
the
dormitory
a
trestled
table
of
wood
held
a
double
row
of
basins
and
you
are
said
griffin
in
a
very
way
better
bag
a
one
is
mine
please
edwin
asked
his
head
was
aching
so
furiously
that
he
could
have
lain
down
on
the
floor
told
you
got
to
bag
one
you
hear
better
go
and
ask
that
man
over
there
try
the
next
one
to
that
man
over
there
was
a
stumpy
boy
with
the
face
of
a
hyena
and
a
shock
of
black
hair
who
scowled
at
approach
get
away
you
come
here
i
want
any
new
kids
near
me
keep
him
to
yourself
ingleby
was
thrown
violently
into
arms
and
then
buffeted
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
shuttlecock
between
them
this
game
proved
to
be
such
excellent
fun
that
wherever
he
sought
a
bed
on
which
to
lay
his
things
it
was
continued
by
his
immediate
neighbours
he
was
greenly
pale
and
beginning
to
cry
when
a
tall
dark
boy
wearing
glasses
arrived
and
made
straight
for
the
group
that
surrounded
him
layton
whispered
some
one
this
he
asked
new
boy
your
name
the
matter
let
me
find
a
along
down
this
end
he
moved
majestically
to
the
end
of
the
dormitory
nearest
to
the
door
and
pointed
to
a
vacant
bedstead
you
are
he
said
he
was
kindly
without
the
least
trace
of
unbending
ingleby
took
him
for
a
prefect
already
he
had
received
the
canonisation
of
heroism
he
stood
and
watched
edwin
spread
out
his
nightshirt
on
the
bed
at
this
moment
the
climax
of
his
migraine
arrived
edwin
was
sick
lips
curled
little
skunk
he
said
as
he
hurried
away
a
slipper
cleverly
aimed
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
caught
ingleby
full
on
his
burning
cheek
the
pain
seemed
to
blind
him
and
a
skunk
in
spite
of
himself
he
remained
for
small
boys
are
as
persistently
unintelligent
as
parrots
in
their
memory
for
names
became
a
tradition
that
he
never
wholly
lived
down
during
his
first
years
at
in
them
he
experienced
all
the
inevitable
qualms
of
homesickness
although
even
these
were
more
tolerable
than
the
physical
qualms
which
had
complicated
his
arrival
for
they
passed
quickly
in
the
excitement
of
a
new
life
the
adoption
of
new
standards
the
spring
of
new
ambitions
it
was
a
thousand
times
unfortunate
that
he
should
have
made
such
a
sensational
débût
that
chance
should
have
included
such
circumstances
as
griffin
and
a
in
his
first
day
for
all
that
was
instinct
in
the
boy
rebelled
against
the
category
in
which
he
found
himself
placed
the
definition
of
his
status
that
had
been
hastily
formulated
by
a
few
small
boys
and
almost
tacitly
accepted
by
the
masters
to
begin
with
he
had
very
few
of
the
attributes
of
the
skunk
he
was
neither
dirty
nor
undersized
indeed
he
had
a
nice
instinct
for
personal
cleanliness
and
all
the
slim
balanced
beauty
of
a
young
figure
he
was
far
from
this
counts
for
little
enough
in
the
schedules
of
precedence
at
school
it
amounted
to
this
he
was
not
used
to
the
company
of
other
boys
he
had
never
played
games
he
had
made
himself
objectionable
on
his
first
night
in
the
layton
had
called
him
a
skunk
griffin
saw
to
the
rest
seconded
by
the
lad
with
the
hyena
face
who
bore
the
illustrious
name
of
douglas
strangely
enough
no
one
but
ingleby
seemed
to
have
tapped
the
romance
in
the
name
setting
out
to
find
any
tokens
of
chevy
chase
beneath
the
black
mop
he
was
caught
staring
in
hall
and
as
a
proper
retribution
for
such
insolence
subjected
to
the
pain
and
indignity
of
a
with
a
gym
shoe
his
head
wedged
in
two
stocks
of
thighs
new
boys
of
his
own
age
and
smaller
seeing
this
exhibition
formed
a
very
low
estimate
of
ingleby
they
shuddered
also
at
the
knowledge
that
he
had
been
heard
to
ask
the
difference
between
a
and
a
punt
this
isolation
except
for
purposes
of
chastisement
weighed
heavily
on
edwin
he
wish
to
be
different
from
others
although
he
felt
that
his
mind
was
somehow
of
a
painfully
foreign
texture
he
knew
that
things
somehow
struck
him
differently
but
he
was
so
far
from
taking
this
as
a
mark
of
superiority
that
he
was
heartily
ashamed
of
it
his
whole
ambition
was
towards
the
normal
he
tried
vigorously
to
suppress
imagination
humour
all
the
inconvenient
things
with
which
he
had
been
cursed
to
starve
them
to
destroy
them
he
became
studious
of
the
ways
of
normality
griffin
and
the
noble
douglas
were
handy
exemplars
layton
the
head
of
the
house
an
unattainable
ideal
layton
indeed
was
something
of
a
variant
but
layton
by
means
of
his
slim
capacity
for
retaining
facts
and
an
ingratiating
piety
had
passed
beyond
the
pale
of
everyday
endeavour

longed
to
be
normal
and
they
let
him
he
cultivated
assiduously
the
use
of
the
fashionable
slang
and
that
of
course
was
easy
he
whipped
up
an
interest
in
outdoor
games
played
his
very
hardest
in
the
ordinary
house
football
and
even
volunteered
to
take
part
in
the
soccer
games
organised
on
for
small
boys
by
selby
who
nursed
a
lazy
grudge
against
the
rugby
code
miserable
weeds
they
were
called
enshrining
his
favourite
epithet
but
though
he
plunged
out
of
school
every
morning
to
practise
in
the
fields
before
dinner
ingleby
was
not
destined
to
shine
in
sport
his
habit
of
dropping
off
to
sleep
between
fitful
bursts
of
brilliance
almost
caused
him
to
be
uprooted
from
plantation
of
weeds
this
worry
him
much
because
soccer
was
not
popular
but
after
two
trials
in
the
house
third
which
the
baleful
douglas
captained
he
was
degraded
to
the
scratch
side
known
as
small
boys
and
even
here
the
scrum
extinguished
a
talent
that
might
have
shone
in
the
line
and
since
he
failed
in
every
endeavour
to
attain
normality
whether
by
devotion
to
games
or
by
those
attempts
which
he
made
to
prove
that
he
was
neither
nor
by
a
retiring
manner
and
a
foul
tongue
he
began
to
crawl
back
into
his
shell
nursing
a
passionate
hatred
not
unmixed
with
envy
for
all
those
people
whom
he
hope
to
be
like
and
so
in
a
little
time
this
dangerous
humiliation
turned
to
a
sort
of
pride
it
pleased
him
to
count
himself
their
superior
even
when
he
was
most
downtrodden
his
form
master
had
recently
been
boring
the
class
with
a
little
dissertation
on
marcus
aurelius
edwin
became
a
stoic
spending
his
days
in
far
corners
of
the
munching
a
slowly
dwindling
store
of
biscuits
once
griffin
caught
him
with
his
locker
door
open
and
pinioned
him
against
the
benches
while
douglas
made
free
with
his
to
the
rest
of
the
for
such
contingencies
as
this
the
system
of
philosophy
seemed
hardly
adequate
most
of
all
he
dreaded
the
dormitory
for
here
the
abandonment
of
clothes
laid
him
open
to
particularly
painful
forms
of
oppression
the
shock
and
horror
of
bedclothes
ragged
just
as
he
was
falling
off
to
sleep
the
numbing
swing
of
a
pillow
the
lancinating
flick
of
wet
towels
oh
hell
of
a
life
only
to
be
terminated
by
the
arrival
of
layton
who
had
the
privilege
of
sitting
up
till
eleven
with
black
rings
round
his
spectacled
eyes
he
was
reading
for
a
scholarship
at
cambridge
then
ingleby
would
really
get
off
to
sleep
or
sometimes
if
he
were
too
excited
watch
the
moonlight
broken
by
the
stone
mullions
of
the
windows
whiten
the
long
and
cast
blue
shadows
so
intense
that
they
heightened
the
bareness
of
the
dormitory
or
else
he
would
listen
to
the
harsh
breathing
of
douglas
who
slept
with
his
mouth
open
and
wonder
what
all
those
heavy
sleepers
were
dreaming
of
or
if
they
dreamed
at
all
and
then
his
own
magic
casements
were
opened
at
he
had
discovered
the
a
new
thing
for
historical
dreaming
his
form
were
busy
with
the
age
of
the
stuarts
under
the
direction
of
a
master
named
leeming
a
cleric
rather
shy
of
boys
and
feverishly
grateful
whenever
he
sprung
a
response
to
his
own
enthusiasms
ingleby
drank
deep
of
the
romance
and
this
heady
wine
coloured
his
dreams
he
would
dream
sometimes
of
the
tenanted
oak
of
boscobel
watching
with
agony
the
movements
of
the
roundhead
searchers
sometimes
he
would
stand
elbowing
in
the
crowd
about
that
scaffold
at
whitehall
when
the
martyr
king
stepped
out
the
man
at
his
left
hand
had
been
eating
garlic
ha
frenchman
one
of
those
musketeers
he
would
tremble
with
delight
he
wished
that
he
could
tell
leeming
of
his
dreams
but
they
were
far
too
precious
to
risk
being
bruised
by
laughter
or
unconcern
all
night
long
this
queer
panoramic
rubbish
would
go
seething
through
his
brain
until
at
one
of
the
waiters
swung
a
harsh
bell
outside
the
dormitory
door
and
he
would
turn
over
trying
to
piece
together
the
thin
stuff
that
its
clangour
had
so
suddenly
broken
until
the
rang
and
the
rush
for
early
school
began
he
grew
to
love
the
winter
terms
because
the
darkness
lasted
longer
but
he
did
write
to
his
mother
about
it
always
on
sunday
mornings
the
sergeant
would
come
in
with
a
letter
from
her
full
of
the
strangely
remote
news
of
home
how
the
garden
was
looking
what
aunt
laura
was
doing
and
how
they
talked
of
felling
the
in
the
lane
sometimes
with
the
lavishness
of
an
angel
she
would
put
a
couple
of
penny
stamps
inside
for
his
reply
the
odd
stamp
would
buy
a
stick
of
chocolate
or
a
packet
of
nougat
at
the
tuck
shop
and
in
these
letters
she
rose
quite
unexpectedly
to
the
recitation
of
his
dreams
lovely
it
must
be
for
you
she
wrote
you
come
home
for
the
holidays
at
christmas
we
will
read
some
of
novels
and
and
that
will
give
you
something
more
to
dream
he
began
to
realise
what
he
seen
before
that
his
mother
was
really
a
wonderful
better
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
than
any
of
the
boys
he
would
have
so
much
to
explain
to
you
dear
you
are
lovely
he
wrote
in
reply
and
then
one
day
that
sneak
douglas
fooling
about
in
the
dormitory
with
toothbrush
happened
to
see
the
words
that
were
faintly
printed
on
the
ivory
handle
ingleby
chemist
halesby
he
said
at
breakfast
after
a
propitiatory
but
futile
helping
of
jam
from
pot
he
broke
the
glad
news
to
griffin
a
chemist
why
such
a
skunk
duggy
is
it
true
ingleby
a
he
a
course
a
if
in
trade
they
to
have
sent
you
to
school
here
a
bally
that
same
afternoon
edwin
was
poring
over
a
letter
at
his
desk
in
big
school
his
mother
always
told
him
to
keep
her
letters
day
you
may
like
to
look
at
them
she
said
he
was
reading
this
letter
for
the
tenth
time
to
see
if
he
could
extract
some
last
scrapings
of
the
atmosphere
of
home
which
it
had
brought
him
that
letter
from
girl
said
griffin
rudely
your
mother
a
lady
or
she
have
married
a
chemist
or
be
your
and
then
edwin
jumped
up
overturning
the
form
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
lashed
out
at
face
he
wanted
to
smash
the
freckled
thing
he
only
caught
the
cheek
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
and
then
after
a
second
of
dazed
wonder
at
his
own
achievement
he
rushed
out
of
big
school
across
the
quad
and
up
that
white
road
to
the
downs
chapter
ii
golden
mediocrity
i
of
course
he
got
his
thrashing
in
return
but
in
the
end
he
found
himself
the
gainer
by
that
unthinkable
outburst
the
incident
had
been
noted
and
there
were
those
who
relished
the
blow
to
prestige
a
blow
which
no
recriminatory
lickings
could
efface
edwin
assured
himself
that
he
had
that
day
lighted
such
a
candle
in
england
as
should
never
be
put
out
it
seemed
indeed
as
though
the
affair
had
revealed
to
some
of
his
own
classmates
that
intellectual
superiority
which
they
had
overlooked
before
and
in
particular
it
made
the
basis
of
a
friendship
between
himself
and
one
of
his
rivals
a
boy
named
widdup
who
combined
with
a
head
for
blank
certain
proficiency
in
games
widdup
disliked
griffin
beefy
beast
he
said
make
him
play
footer
and
sweat
some
of
the
fat
off
him
have
been
a
bit
quicker
on
you
he
half
waxy
about
it
he
hates
being
laughed
at
and
so
as
the
terms
slipped
by
ceased
to
be
a
purgatory
edwin
contracted
certain
timid
this
with
adored
a
series
of
perfectly
ordinary
prefects
he
shook
down
into
his
proper
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
after
that
nobody
took
much
notice
of
him
even
the
coalition
who
never
forgave
troubled
him
very
little
certain
outbursts
of
persecution
he
took
as
a
matter
of
course
such
was
the
teaching
of
history
but
the
ways
of
these
two
were
now
widely
divergent
from
those
in
which
he
trod
the
dormitory
was
the
only
place
in
which
they
inevitably
met
for
he
had
managed
to
move
his
seat
in
hall
some
way
from
that
of
griffin
and
in
chapel
the
only
other
place
they
had
in
common
he
was
safe
the
friendship
with
widdup
notably
ripened
they
were
both
members
of
the
same
branch
of
the
natural
history
society
the
one
that
was
labelled
astronomical
the
subject
was
unpopular
for
its
pursuit
was
nocturnal
and
made
no
exciting
appeal
to
the
hunting
instinct
of
boys
the
section
met
every
fortnight
in
the
room
of
one
of
the
mathematical
masters
and
since
they
met
at
night
they
managed
to
escape
second
prep
their
president
mr
heal
was
a
rather
melancholy
performer
on
the
flute
and
edwin
generally
contriving
to
turn
up
some
minutes
before
the
meeting
began
would
stand
at
the
door
listening
to
the
innocent
gentleman
playing
to
himself
unaccompanied
that
he
had
collected
in
the
holidays
at
the
first
sound
of
a
heal
would
unscrew
his
flute
and
pack
it
into
a
case
lined
with
plush
but
it
seemed
as
though
an
afterglow
of
tenderness
still
lingered
on
his
unusually
dull
features
as
for
astronomy
they
never
got
much
farther
than
the
mere
names
of
constellations
and
their
figures
although
widdup
often
asked
questions
which
almost
tapped
the
mathematical
subject
these
adventures
were
discouraged
for
mr
heal
had
grown
to
hate
mathematics
but
they
did
learn
to
find
their
way
about
the
paths
of
the
sky
and
often
on
frosty
winter
evenings
when
the
clear
vault
above
the
downs
was
like
jet
edwin
and
widdup
would
walk
up
and
down
the
quad
and
imagine
that
they
could
feel
the
heave
of
the
spinning
world
while
they
watched
capella
scale
the
dome
of
sky
and
once
when
he
had
come
to
the
room
a
little
early
on
the
night
of
the
section
meeting
mr
heal
cleared
his
throat
and
taking
edwin
by
the
ear
began
to
read
from
an
book
that
he
held
in
his
hand
he
read
atrociously
do
you
like
this
he
said
he
said
with
a
little
snarl
in
it
dog
star
and
aldebaran
pointing
to
the
restless
pleiades
were
half
up
the
southern
sky
and
between
them
hung
orion
which
gorgeous
constellation
never
burnt
more
vividly
than
now
as
it
swung
itself
forth
above
the
rim
of
the
landscape
castor
and
pollux
with
their
quiet
shine
were
almost
on
the
meridian
the
barren
and
gloomy
square
of
pegasus
was
creeping
round
to
the
far
away
through
the
plantation
vega
sparkled
like
a
lamp
suspended
amid
the
leafless
trees
and
chair
stood
daintily
poised
in
the
uppermost
edwin
thought
it
was
than
the
of
the
asked
mr
heal
come
ingleby
surely
not
sir
said
edwin
mr
heal
shut
the
book
barren
and
gloomy
square
of
pegasus
he
murmured
to
himself
and
all
the
rest
of
that
evening
edwin
found
himself
remembering
the
phrase
the
bareness
and
the
gloom
of
pegasus
had
never
struck
him
before
and
now
at
a
sudden
suggestion
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
sky
had
changed
the
vague
heavens
became
habitable
to
his
fancy
new
and
immense
territory
opened
before
he
told
widdup
what
he
remembered
of
the
passage
that
heal
had
read
old
tommy
said
widdup
compassionately
an
exact
square
at
all
an
irregular
quadrilateral
and
i
see
anything
gloomy
about
it
stars
gloomy
anyway
look
how
they
sparkle
look
at
above
the
gable
of
the
swimming
bath
that
wonderful
star
throbbed
white
ii
in
the
lent
term
they
both
had
measles
and
woke
with
swollen
eyes
to
find
each
other
side
by
side
in
the
same
ward
at
the
sanatorium
was
successor
payne
a
thawed
thin
almost
unfamiliar
payne
and
while
they
swam
upon
the
first
buoyant
spirits
of
convalescence
the
sheer
hulk
of
griffin
was
hove
in
in
the
snivelling
misery
of
the
early
stages
edwin
thought
that
griffin
had
never
looked
so
beastly
and
rejoiced
in
the
humiliation
but
when
at
last
griffin
recovered
he
found
his
ancient
victim
a
handy
plaything
and
for
want
of
anything
better
to
do
attempted
to
seduce
widdup
from
friendship
edwin
never
quite
forgave
widdup
his
defection
and
when
they
were
all
better
and
back
in
school
again
he
found
that
he
still
had
to
avoid
griffin
on
whom
the
habit
of
persecution
had
been
regrafted
it
seemed
such
a
pity
he
thought
he
had
outgrown
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
now
he
hated
griffin
for
a
new
reason
while
they
were
together
in
the
sanatorium
after
the
departure
of
payne
griffin
had
spoken
boastfully
of
his
relations
with
one
of
the
whose
morning
task
was
the
making
of
beds
in
d
dormitory
it
appeared
that
griffin
had
met
her
first
by
accident
and
later
by
appointment
and
he
himself
described
her
as
hot
he
was
familiar
with
certain
shops
in
the
neighbourhood
of
shaftesbury
avenue
which
made
persuasion
easy
to
edwin
whose
life
at
home
had
kept
him
in
ignorance
of
all
that
a
boy
of
fifteen
ought
to
know
everything
sounded
horrible
and
he
said
so
he
remembered
the
look
of
the
girl
quite
well
rather
anæmic
with
black
hair
and
a
pretty
oval
face
griffin
and
widdup
howled
over
his
innocence
and
began
to
instruct
him
in
the
of
all
these
things
came
as
a
great
shock
to
edwin
he
felt
a
passionate
conviction
that
the
other
two
were
fooling
him
unfortunately
his
father
had
never
employed
a
coachman
believe
a
bit
of
it
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
silly
kid
said
widdup
knows
believe
my
father
would
do
a
thing
like
that
cried
edwin
it
seemed
suddenly
as
if
the
world
had
become
a
gross
and
horrible
planet
the
fetters
of
earth
were
galling
his
limbs
he
felt
a
sudden
immense
yearning
for
the
coolness
and
cleanliness
of
stellar
space
if
only
he
could
pass
the
rest
of
his
life
in
the
great
square
of
pegasus
and
he
was
consoled
by
the
assurance
that
in
heaven
at
any
rate
there
was
no
marrying
or
giving
in
iii
next
term
to
his
great
joy
he
was
moved
up
into
the
upper
fourth
and
had
for
his
the
gentle
leeming
a
fat
and
cheerful
cleric
with
cheeks
that
shone
like
those
of
a
cherub
he
was
very
shortsighted
rather
lazy
and
intensely
grateful
for
the
least
spark
of
intelligence
to
be
found
in
his
class
edwin
soon
attracted
him
by
his
history
and
essays
his
mother
had
fulfilled
her
promise
of
reading
fortunes
of
aloud
in
the
holidays
and
as
luck
would
have
it
again
the
upper
fourth
were
supposed
to
be
concentrating
on
the
early
stuarts
to
the
bulk
of
the
form
the
period
was
a
vast
and
almost
empty
chamber
like
the
big
schoolroom
inhabited
by
one
or
two
stiff
figures
devitalised
by
very
dreary
place
but
to
edwin
it
was
crowded
with
the
swaggerers
of
alsatia
the
bravoes
of
whitehall
with
prentices
and
penniless
scotchmen
and
all
the
rest
of
gallant
company
any
of
you
read
leeming
asked
the
class
have
sir
said
edwin
shyly
have
already
gathered
so
ingleby
has
anybody
else
read
it
silence
think
i
shall
ask
the
head
master
to
set
it
to
the
middle
school
as
a
holiday
task
said
leeming
thus
narrowly
did
edwin
escape
the
disaster
of
having
scott
spoiled
for
him
leeming
was
the
master
in
charge
of
the
library
and
edwin
began
to
spend
the
long
winter
in
this
room
most
of
the
boys
who
frequented
it
came
there
for
the
bound
volumes
of
the
london
with
their
pictures
of
the
war
irish
evictions
the
launching
of
the
and
mild
excitements
of
that
kind
edwin
found
himself
drawn
early
to
the
bookcase
that
held
the
poets
to
his
great
joy
he
discovered
that
the
key
of
his
playbox
fitted
the
case
and
so
he
would
sometimes
sneak
into
the
room
at
odd
moments
in
the
day
and
carry
away
with
him
certain
slim
green
volumes
from
the
top
shelf
these
were
of
the
together
with
their
complete
works
he
had
been
attracted
to
them
in
the
first
place
by
the
memory
of
a
polished
urn
about
as
graceful
in
contour
as
a
baluster
that
stood
in
a
neglected
corner
of
the
parish
church
at
home
this
urn
was
encircled
by
a
scroll
which
bore
these
directions
smite
thy
breast
and
drop
a
for
know
thy
dust
lies
a
palpable
falsehood
for
edwin
had
already
discovered
the
tomb
of
the
elegist
in
another
part
of
the
churchyard
elbowed
almost
into
the
path
by
that
of
a
victorian
ironmonger
but
it
was
something
to
have
been
born
in
the
same
parish
as
a
poet
and
edwin
at
an
age
when
everything
is
a
matter
of
taking
sides
ranged
himself
boldly
with
shenstone
and
pitted
his
judgment
against
that
of
johnson
who
rather
sniffed
at
the
unreality
and
quoted
letters
in
his
despite
the
crook
and
the
pipe
and
the
kid
were
to
edwin
very
real
things
as
one
supposes
they
were
almost
real
to
the
age
of
the
pastoral
ballad
and
the
atmosphere
was
the
more
vital
to
him
because
he
dimly
remembered
the
sight
of
the
lawns
frosted
on
misty
mornings
of
winter
the
sighing
of
the
leasowes
beeches
and
the
damp
drippings
of
the
winter
woods
thus
he
absorbed
not
only
shenstone
but
contemporaries
men
like
dyer
and
lyttleton
and
akenside
and
since
he
had
no
other
standard
than
that
of
johnson
he
classed
them
by
the
same
lights
as
their
contemporaries
brooding
among
augustan
poetasters
in
the
library
leeming
found
him
ingleby
me
see
prior
ah
that
was
a
little
age
ingleby
the
augustans
were
not
great
men
and
some
of
them
were
very
coarse
too
have
you
read
the
idylls
of
the
king
leeming
introduced
ingleby
to
the
great
victorian
for
he
himself
was
an
ardent
believer
in
all
the
galahad
nonsense
and
was
astonished
at
ignorance
of
the
school
in
which
those
cherubic
cheeks
had
expanded
he
was
very
fond
of
talking
about
purity
and
conceived
it
his
duty
to
keep
his
class
spotless
in
the
lent
term
when
the
form
were
working
through
the
catechism
his
glosses
were
most
apparent
the
explanation
of
some
passages
troubled
him
a
bad
thing
he
would
mutter
and
once
having
put
edwin
in
the
way
of
perfection
he
was
not
going
to
look
back
a
week
or
two
later
he
asked
him
how
he
was
getting
on
with
tennyson
is
your
favourite
character
in
the
idylls
he
asked
edwin
glowed
sir
what
about
sir
percivale
percivale
whom
arthur
and
his
knighthood
called
pure
he
quoted
in
the
oxford
variety
of
cockney
know
sir
stammered
edwin
seem
somehow
made
differently
from
said
leeming
impressively
a
great
and
wonderful
prototype
whom
we
should
all
try
to
imitate
no
matter
how
edwin
who
had
read
the
dedication
wondered
why
leeming
lowered
his
voice
like
that
in
speaking
of
the
prince
consort
in
some
ways
he
was
grateful
to
leeming
for
superintending
his
literary
diet
but
he
soon
detected
a
sameness
in
the
fare
one
day
he
had
got
hold
of
a
big
maroon
edition
of
george
gordon
lord
byron
with
romantic
engravings
of
the
newstead
ruins
and
the
own
handsome
head
and
leeming
had
swooped
down
on
him
faintly
flushed
byron
he
had
said
not
a
good
man
have
you
read
and
he
reached
down
longfellow
longfellow
in
green
boards
decorated
with
a
geometrical
design
in
gold
and
irritating
to
the
touch
at
last
edwin
was
almost
driven
from
the
library
by
attentions
he
never
read
byron
because
the
books
were
too
big
to
be
sneaked
out
of
the
room
beneath
a
buttoned
coat
but
he
did
read
without
distinction
nearly
every
volume
of
poetry
that
he
could
smuggle
out
in
this
way
he
read
these
books
in
second
when
layton
was
poring
over
plato
at
his
high
desk
when
widdup
was
working
out
the
cricket
averages
of
the
second
eleven
and
griffin
was
looking
for
spicy
bits
in
the
bible
and
as
second
prep
was
generally
a
period
of
great
the
boys
had
risen
so
early
and
by
that
time
of
evening
the
air
of
the
house
classroom
had
been
breathed
and
rebreathed
so
many
times
as
to
be
almost
narcotic
the
poetry
that
he
read
became
interwoven
with
the
strands
of
his
dreams
dreamy
and
exalted
all
poetry
seemed
at
this
time
and
it
was
to
intensify
this
feeling
of
sensuous
languor
that
he
so
often
chose
the
poems
of
keats
in
an
introduction
to
the
volume
he
had
discovered
that
keats
had
been
an
apothecary
and
this
filled
him
with
a
strange
glow
for
since
the
unforgettable
incident
of
the
toothbrush
he
had
been
against
his
will
diffident
about
his
father
he
determined
never
again
to
be
ashamed
of
the
shop
when
he
read
of
lucent
syrops
tinct
with
cinnamon
he
remembered
a
great
bottle
of
some
cough
linctus
that
glowed
like
a
ruby
in
the
shop
window
when
the
gas
was
lit
at
night
in
other
ways
he
tapped
a
good
deal
of
the
romance
of
his
calling
he
remembered
a
drawer
labelled
the
very
next
best
thing
to
a
teeth
with
their
steely
harvest
he
recalled
a
whole
of
provocative
scents
he
shuddered
at
the
remembered
names
of
poisons
and
other
names
that
suggested
alchemy
he
almost
wanted
to
tell
leeming
when
next
they
spoke
together
of
his
trade
but
he
quite
sure
if
leeming
approved
of
keats
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
see
very
much
more
of
this
master
for
he
was
high
up
in
his
form
and
certain
to
get
a
move
into
the
lower
fifth
at
the
end
of
the
term
in
some
ways
he
was
not
sorry
for
the
signs
of
affection
the
warm
encircling
arm
the
pervading
scent
of
honeydew
and
the
naïve
glances
of
those
watery
eyes
were
embarrassing
before
they
parted
leeming
showed
his
intentions
more
clearly
you
like
to
learn
hebrew
ingleby
he
said
edwin
would
have
liked
to
learn
not
out
of
school
hours
he
hesitated
thought
you
might
some
day
wish
to
take
holy
orders
and
i
should
be
glad
to
teach
will
ask
my
father
sir
said
edwin
modestly
that
was
one
of
the
penalties
of
having
interesting
eyes
chapter
iii
the
green
trees
i
the
holidays
that
followed
this
term
were
the
most
marvellous
from
first
to
last
they
were
bathed
in
the
atmosphere
of
mellow
gold
that
makes
beautiful
some
evenings
of
spring
all
tender
and
and
his
mother
too
was
more
wonderful
than
she
had
ever
been
before
on
the
very
first
evening
when
she
had
come
upstairs
to
tuck
him
in
and
to
kiss
him
she
sat
on
the
bedstead
leaning
over
him
with
both
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
whispering
secrets
to
him
very
extraordinary
they
were
and
as
she
told
him
her
lips
were
soft
on
his
cheek
she
said
that
only
a
month
before
she
had
expected
to
have
a
baby
sister
for
had
always
longed
so
much
to
have
a
baby
before
the
first
jealousy
that
had
flamed
up
into
his
mind
had
died
away
she
told
him
how
the
baby
had
been
born
dead
and
how
terribly
she
had
felt
the
disappointment
he
wondered
in
the
dark
if
she
were
crying
now
that
got
my
other
baby
again
she
said
am
going
to
forget
all
about
it
be
ever
so
happy
by
ourselves
eddie
we
in
the
evenings
when
father
is
down
at
business
we
will
read
together
this
time
take
turns
reading
for
growing
such
a
big
boy
and
go
wonderful
walks
only
not
very
far
because
thornhouse
says
not
strong
enough
yet
i
want
you
to
tell
me
you
do
and
think
about
at
school
because
all
got
now
and
part
of
me
eddie
at
this
she
clutched
him
passionately
for
a
moment
edwin
was
nearly
crying
and
then
suddenly
he
saw
another
side
of
it
her
expressed
feelings
were
somehow
foreign
to
him
and
made
him
ashamed
as
did
watery
eyes
when
he
talked
about
prototype
in
the
face
of
this
eager
emotion
he
felt
himself
unresponsive
and
a
little
consciously
superior
and
male
he
want
to
feel
superior
to
his
there
it
was
even
at
breakfast
next
morning
he
was
shy
and
it
surprised
him
when
he
saw
her
clear
eyes
wholly
free
from
any
answering
shame
so
unconscious
was
she
of
his
scrutiny
that
he
went
on
looking
at
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
looking
he
began
to
differentiate
this
new
being
so
fragile
and
eager
and
girlish
from
the
old
traditional
mother
whom
he
had
loved
and
accepted
as
unquestionably
as
the
miles
of
blue
sky
above
him
he
discovered
that
she
was
a
woman
remembered
griffin
and
blushed
a
colour
got
boy
said
his
father
and
it
struck
him
also
that
she
was
smaller
than
she
used
to
be
mother
rather
thin
he
asked
his
father
ingleby
smiled
and
in
his
grave
shy
way
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
hers
as
it
lay
on
the
table
silly
boy
said
his
mother
but
her
denials
did
not
satisfy
him
he
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
different
from
the
mother
whom
he
had
known
he
noticed
too
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
eat
the
same
food
as
the
rest
of
them
sometimes
she
would
forget
their
rules
and
taste
things
that
were
forbidden
and
then
his
father
would
gravely
reprove
her
instead
of
bread
she
was
ordered
to
eat
a
sort
of
biscuit
which
curiosity
made
him
anxious
to
taste
he
was
disappointed
for
they
had
no
taste
at
all
are
they
made
of
he
asked
and
they
told
him
the
sticky
part
of
wheat
without
and
yet
in
spite
of
her
illness
they
had
never
been
happier
together
the
new
intimacy
that
had
begun
with
her
painful
confidences
of
the
first
evening
continued
in
particular
she
told
him
of
the
difficulties
which
she
was
having
with
his
aunt
laura
her
sister
who
had
lately
married
a
small
manufacturer
and
come
to
live
near
halesby
the
story
was
an
old
one
and
rather
unhappy
it
began
years
and
years
ago
in
the
days
of
his
childhood
days
that
she
remembered
so
unhappily
that
she
never
really
wanted
to
recall
them
he
had
never
before
known
anything
about
his
childhood
he
had
just
taken
her
for
granted
in
her
present
surroundings
now
in
the
long
firelight
evenings
she
told
him
how
her
forefathers
and
his
had
once
been
great
people
living
in
a
stone
border
castle
high
above
the
monmouth
marches
and
how
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
decay
of
the
bloody
age
in
which
their
violence
had
prospered
the
family
had
fallen
from
its
estate
and
lost
its
lands
how
the
tower
of
the
castle
had
been
broken
and
under
its
shadow
a
farmhouse
had
arisen
in
which
they
had
lived
and
scraped
what
income
they
could
make
from
a
little
and
many
acres
of
mountain
pasture
now
there
were
none
of
them
left
there
but
still
where
the
tracks
grew
stony
and
the
orchards
began
to
thin
away
the
walls
of
the
house
crumbled
patiently
under
the
shadow
of
overhanging
grandfather
was
the
last
of
them
eddie
she
said
was
a
and
for
a
moment
consciousness
of
griffin
and
his
social
prejudices
invaded
the
picture
she
told
him
of
spring
days
when
the
clouds
would
come
sweeping
out
of
england
on
the
back
of
the
east
wind
and
be
hurried
like
the
frothy
comb
of
a
wave
against
the
mountains
and
how
they
would
then
break
asunder
on
the
darens
and
fall
back
in
a
drenching
mist
over
the
lonely
house
by
felindre
and
for
days
the
farm
would
be
islanded
in
fog
but
on
the
summit
above
them
the
sheep
were
grazing
in
the
sunlight
and
the
buzzards
hunting
and
in
the
misty
lowlands
beneath
lay
orchards
full
of
apple
blossom
were
not
the
only
decayed
family
there
she
said
were
others
and
as
the
grosmonts
of
trecastel
but
old
grosmont
had
two
sons
and
father
only
had
three
daughters
i
was
a
sort
of
ugly
duckling
eddie
they
never
really
liked
me
and
i
was
never
happy
think
i
must
be
like
you
darling
said
edwin
had
a
rotten
time
at
at
first
even
now
i
quite
seem
to
be
i
know
she
smiled
and
kissed
him
father
was
a
dear
she
said
mother
really
hated
me
your
aunt
carrie
was
much
cleverer
and
than
me
and
so
they
always
made
a
fuss
of
her
and
left
me
to
myself
she
had
all
the
advantages
you
see
i
suppose
they
thought
she
was
worth
it
she
was
a
beautiful
selfish
creature
with
the
most
lovely
sure
it
lovelier
than
yours
darling
said
edwin
she
went
and
threw
herself
away
as
mother
called
it
on
a
man
she
met
at
a
hunt
ball
in
hereford
and
she
died
poor
thing
with
her
first
baby
it
was
an
awful
blow
to
mother
it
made
her
more
horrid
to
me
than
ever
i
suppose
she
found
me
such
a
poor
substitute
if
it
had
been
me
it
have
mattered
i
went
to
keep
house
for
your
in
north
bromwich
and
there
i
met
your
father
i
have
never
been
really
happy
you
see
nobody
had
ever
taken
any
notice
of
that
then
mother
began
to
put
all
the
hopes
that
had
been
disappointed
in
carrie
on
aunt
laura
nothing
was
too
good
for
her
they
spoiled
her
and
spoiled
her
it
was
worse
when
father
died
and
mother
was
left
to
do
what
she
liked
with
the
money
and
when
your
aunt
laura
came
here
and
met
fellows
and
married
him
your
grandmother
blamed
me
i
help
it
and
in
any
case
fellows
is
an
awfully
nice
quiet
man
i
did
all
i
could
for
her
too
getting
her
house
ready
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
now
so
dreadfully
difficult
i
suppose
really
annoyed
to
think
that
she
done
better
for
herself
with
all
her
advantages
of
education
and
just
lets
it
off
on
me
dreadfully
awkward
eddie
i
think
even
jealous
that
their
house
as
big
as
ours
i
simply
tell
your
father
the
sort
of
things
said
if
he
knew
one
of
them
never
forgive
her
like
that
about
anything
that
affects
should
be
too
said
edwin
you
she
smiled
made
me
hate
aunt
laura
feel
like
that
eddie
young
and
been
spoilt
it
all
her
fault
it
were
any
one
but
you
i
mind
but
so
he
loved
to
look
into
her
eyes
when
she
loved
him
ii
after
this
they
had
wonderful
times
together
in
the
mornings
edwin
would
indulge
his
glorious
idleness
among
the
books
of
the
shelves
and
after
dinner
when
his
father
had
gone
back
to
the
shop
he
would
set
out
with
his
mother
up
the
lane
under
the
tall
elms
and
through
the
sloping
field
that
led
to
the
mill
pond
they
did
not
walk
very
far
because
she
must
not
be
but
the
field
was
so
crowded
with
wonders
that
they
were
tempted
further
cowslips
steeped
the
meadows
in
their
vinous
perfume
and
between
the
saplings
of
the
hazel
copse
they
saw
the
sheeted
hyacinths
gleaming
like
pools
that
mirror
the
sky
in
open
places
beyond
the
land
of
meadows
and
copses
they
came
to
a
belt
of
the
old
forest
through
which
they
could
see
up
a
broad
green
lane
to
the
very
shoulders
of
the
hills
pen
beacon
heaving
its
fleece
of
black
firs
and
the
domed
head
of
uffdown
his
mother
would
sigh
a
little
when
she
saw
the
hills
in
weather
that
threatened
rain
from
the
west
they
would
seem
so
near
with
their
contour
hard
against
the
watery
sky
and
the
cloud
shadows
all
prussian
blue
i
should
love
to
be
there
edwin
she
would
say
we
walk
there
some
day
dearest
such
a
terrible
drag
up
we
should
both
be
dreadfully
i
wish
we
could
mother
i
do
wish
we
the
day
of
their
last
walk
together
when
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
green
lane
and
were
sitting
on
the
gate
she
jumped
down
on
the
far
side
and
set
off
walking
up
the
track
along
eddie
she
said
going
up
to
mother
he
cried
it
too
far
i
should
like
to
carry
you
and
but
fearfully
eager
for
adventure
they
set
off
together
as
they
climbed
upward
it
seemed
that
the
air
grew
sweeter
every
moment
and
when
they
had
left
the
wood
behind
them
they
came
out
on
to
a
stony
lane
with
a
surface
of
grit
veined
by
the
tracks
of
and
on
either
side
banks
of
tufted
grass
along
which
gorse
was
swaying
in
the
breeze
and
here
the
clouds
seemed
to
be
racing
close
above
their
heads
all
dazzling
white
and
the
blue
in
which
they
moved
was
deep
and
limpid
eyes
were
full
of
laughter
and
her
face
flushed
with
the
climb
mother
edwin
panted
an
awful
lick
you
go
we
better
sit
down
a
bit
catch
cold
you
careless
boy
get
to
the
top
soon
you
tire
she
laughed
at
him
this
air
is
wonderful
she
said
as
if
it
had
come
straight
out
of
the
blue
all
washed
and
on
the
top
of
uffdown
where
the
cloak
of
pine
droops
to
a
hollow
between
the
two
peaks
they
sat
on
a
dry
yielding
where
the
grass
was
thick
as
the
fleece
of
a
mountain
sheep
and
four
lovely
counties
dreamed
below
them
she
asked
half
joking
does
the
west
wind
come
from
edwin
was
willing
to
instruct
i
know
wales
and
the
sea
i
your
head
close
to
mine
and
show
those
hills
that
look
like
mountains
cut
out
of
blue
cardboard
are
the
malverns
and
far
ever
so
far
beyond
just
to
the
left
you
see
a
level
ridge
that
drops
suddenly
in
the
west
you
know
what
that
is
eddie
do
you
like
to
look
at
single
things
i
like
to
feel
call
it
dreamy
underneath
you
must
look
at
that
the
mountain
eddie
close
to
where
i
was
he
asked
i
never
knew
that
you
could
see
it
from
here
you
never
told
know
why
i
told
you
that
i
was
never
happy
there
and
now
you
see
since
the
old
people
died
and
the
land
was
sold
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
rather
wonderful
to
be
looking
another
country
it
is
wales
it
of
in
wales
felindre
is
in
edwin
pondered
for
a
moment
rather
glad
not
anyway
he
said
i
wish
been
you
she
answered
dreamily
wish
we
had
been
there
together
it
was
a
different
sort
of
life
i
just
thought
i
should
like
to
see
it
he
was
a
little
alarmed
at
the
wistfulness
in
her
voice
do
you
mean
he
cried
eddie
nothing
it
was
another
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
pulled
him
gently
to
her
he
was
content
to
lie
there
with
his
head
on
her
breast
while
she
talked
in
a
low
voice
of
that
distant
place
and
of
her
own
childhood
he
listened
in
a
dream
and
did
not
speak
at
all
until
she
began
to
tell
him
a
long
story
which
the
felindre
shepherd
morgan
had
told
her
when
she
was
a
child
then
edwin
opened
his
eyes
and
stopped
her
i
know
that
story
he
said
go
on
wonderful
told
it
to
you
before
perhaps
i
told
you
when
you
were
a
used
to
talk
to
you
a
great
deal
in
your
cradle
perhaps
i
was
rather
lonely
when
you
came
no
sure
you
the
cloud
is
blotting
out
my
mountain
now
she
said
is
time
we
were
the
counties
were
asleep
already
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
they
stepped
into
a
different
world
for
where
the
smoke
of
the
black
country
had
blotted
the
fading
skyline
a
hundred
pit
fires
were
beginning
to
blink
out
and
nearer
still
a
pillar
of
flame
shot
up
into
the
sky
look
mother
edwin
cried
puddling
the
iron
at
the
great
mawne
furnaces
stand
still
a
moment
we
might
almost
hear
their
but
no
sound
came
to
them
but
the
clear
tinkle
of
a
stream
plunging
into
its
mossy
cup
and
this
seemed
to
bring
them
back
into
touch
with
the
lands
that
they
had
left
they
hurried
down
through
the
dark
woodland
paths
and
when
they
reached
the
little
town
lights
had
bloomed
in
all
the
ugly
cottage
windows
and
the
streets
seemed
deserted
for
the
children
were
indoors
iii
she
told
him
that
she
was
rather
tired
and
would
like
to
lie
down
and
rest
for
a
little
time
before
supper
and
with
the
glow
of
the
hill
air
still
on
his
cheeks
and
his
limbs
full
of
a
delicious
lassitude
he
strolled
down
the
lane
and
into
the
street
of
the
town
he
passed
through
the
little
passage
at
the
side
of
the
shop
and
through
the
dark
where
he
had
to
pick
his
way
among
drug
hampers
and
empty
through
the
upper
part
of
the
glass
door
he
could
see
his
father
sitting
on
a
high
stool
at
the
desk
his
spectacles
down
his
nose
dreaming
among
the
bad
debts
in
his
ledger
edwin
stood
there
for
several
minutes
for
the
picture
fascinated
him
ingleby
had
now
reached
the
indeterminate
period
of
middle
age
his
hair
was
gray
rather
thin
about
the
crown
and
wanted
cutting
in
the
shop
he
always
wore
a
black
alpaca
jacket
and
this
by
reason
of
its
thinness
made
his
chest
look
mean
and
skimpy
in
this
state
of
comparative
repose
he
was
not
impressive
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
hand
to
scratch
his
shoulder
a
customer
came
in
to
buy
a
cake
of
soap
and
ingleby
climbed
down
from
his
stool
to
attend
to
her
he
opened
a
glass
case
and
groping
for
this
particular
soap
upset
at
least
half
a
dozen
others
edwin
noticed
his
hands
which
were
clumsy
and
heavily
veined
on
the
back
and
felt
sorry
for
him
when
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
cakes
of
soap
that
he
had
upset
it
all
seemed
so
inelastic
so
different
from
the
eager
youth
of
his
mother
examining
his
father
from
a
physical
standpoint
he
recalled
the
day
on
which
widdup
had
begun
his
sexual
education
and
had
laughed
at
his
innocent
ideals
now
edwin
laughed
at
himself
and
the
laugh
made
ingleby
look
up
as
if
a
flying
beetle
had
banged
against
his
ear
boy
he
said
were
late
for
tea
you
two
we
had
a
lovely
on
to
hope
you
tire
your
mother
you
must
be
careful
eddie
do
you
want
me
to
give
you
something
to
do
you
shall
weigh
these
powders
then
phenacetin
five
grains
in
each
only
try
to
be
quiet
i
have
to
get
on
with
these
ingleby
yawned
and
edwin
started
to
weigh
powders
what
is
blood
the
blood
of
dragons
edwin
ingleby
smiled
under
his
glasses
father
blood
is
a
resin
prepared
from
and
used
for
mahogany
sorry
to
disappoint
you
silence
for
five
minutes
keats
was
a
ingleby
pronounced
the
word
in
the
same
tone
as
he
would
have
used
if
he
had
been
saying
madam
yes
of
course
he
was
he
was
consumptive
too
died
in
edwin
was
thankful
to
leave
it
at
that
thankful
that
his
father
knew
just
so
much
even
if
he
know
any
more
it
would
be
terrible
to
know
more
than
your
father
to
feel
that
he
was
a
sort
of
intellectual
inferior
to
boy
of
fifteen
he
would
not
talk
of
these
things
any
more
they
walked
home
in
silence
it
seemed
as
if
ingleby
were
still
worrying
about
his
tiredness
for
when
she
tried
to
joke
with
him
at
the
supper
table
he
was
moody
and
restrained
not
really
a
bit
overdone
she
protested
kissing
his
forehead
like
a
pair
of
children
the
two
of
you
he
said
and
indeed
his
gray
seriousness
seemed
to
isolate
him
from
all
the
joy
of
youth
that
was
in
them
that
night
mother
sat
for
a
long
time
on
the
bed
talking
to
him
in
a
low
voice
she
would
not
tell
him
any
more
about
the
mountain
farmstead
that
had
once
been
a
castle
even
when
he
begged
her
to
do
so
she
wanted
to
talk
she
said
about
all
that
he
was
to
do
during
the
term
to
make
wonderful
plans
for
the
holidays
when
the
days
would
be
longer
and
they
would
be
able
to
sit
out
under
the
limes
on
the
lawn
in
the
twilight
am
going
to
plant
evening
stock
she
said
along
the
lawn
border
in
between
the
irises
besides
i
shall
be
stronger
then
and
we
will
often
take
our
tea
with
us
to
and
at
last
she
said
you
bad
boy
you
must
really
go
to
sleep
now
darling
got
such
a
big
journey
before
you
and
sure
to
get
a
headache
if
you
have
a
good
she
kissed
him
many
times
iv
and
when
she
had
passed
downstairs
to
the
where
her
husband
sat
before
the
fire
in
a
plush
lightly
dozing
she
kissed
him
too
she
was
feeling
queerly
flushed
and
emotional
and
somehow
the
atmosphere
of
that
little
room
felt
stuffy
to
her
after
the
air
of
the
open
spaces
restless
dear
she
said
hate
eddie
going
back
to
school
dreadful
to
be
parted
from
your
baby
just
when
beginning
to
be
more
and
more
part
of
close
to
me
by
the
fire
child
he
said
i
want
some
music
i
she
went
into
the
and
lit
the
candles
on
the
piano
sitting
there
in
the
pale
light
with
a
shawl
thrown
over
her
muslin
she
looked
very
frail
and
pathetic
against
the
ebony
she
played
the
of
beethoven
and
the
rather
tawdry
little
on
the
piano
danced
as
if
they
were
made
uncomfortable
by
the
rugged
passion
the
whole
room
seemed
a
little
bit
artificial
and
threadbare
ministering
to
her
discontent
when
the
was
finished
she
still
sat
at
the
piano
conscious
of
her
own
reflection
in
its
polished
panels
and
wanting
to
cry
she
could
not
bear
the
taunting
of
that
image
and
so
she
snuffed
the
candles
and
sat
in
the
dark
edwin
tossing
on
the
verge
of
sleep
was
conscious
of
the
music
ceasing
and
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
cool
cries
of
the
owls
chapter
iv
midsummer
i
edwin
had
expected
that
the
wrench
of
going
back
to
school
after
these
holidays
would
be
unbearable
but
when
he
returned
to
next
day
he
was
almost
astonished
at
his
own
acceptance
of
the
change
it
was
evening
when
he
arrived
and
boys
who
had
come
from
a
greater
distance
than
he
were
already
unpacking
their
in
the
long
edwin
sniffed
the
smell
which
he
had
once
found
so
mingled
odour
of
cricket
flannels
biscuits
and
faint
mustiness
with
relish
he
passed
through
the
into
the
library
dark
and
echoing
and
groped
his
way
towards
the
poetry
bookshelves
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
brass
netting
that
protected
their
case
he
even
tried
his
key
to
see
if
it
had
lost
its
cunning
the
lock
opened
easily
and
he
felt
for
the
backs
of
the
big
maroon
volumes
of
byron
with
their
shiny
he
thought
of
leeming
and
of
sir
percivale
a
foolish
phrase
one
of
a
kind
that
he
had
often
lately
found
running
through
his
groups
of
words
that
meant
nothing
in
itself
in
his
mind
and
stuck
there
white
lie
of
a
blameless
he
laughed
at
himself
these
words
that
came
from
nowhere
were
the
strangest
things
he
heard
the
echo
of
his
own
laugh
in
the
dark
and
empty
room
the
white
lie
of
a
blameless
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
he
had
done
with
leeming
as
a
even
though
the
question
of
hebrew
and
holy
orders
remained
unanswered
stepping
out
of
the
library
he
was
hailed
by
widdup
a
plumper
sunbrowned
widdup
fresh
from
three
weeks
with
a
doctor
uncle
in
devonshire
there
had
been
long
drives
through
the
lanes
at
the
back
of
start
bay
where
the
primroses
so
widdup
assured
him
were
as
big
as
there
had
actually
been
in
april
and
the
joy
of
watching
huge
liners
homeward
bound
from
india
making
the
start
hills
said
widdup
never
saw
such
hills
talk
about
these
downs
awfully
hilly
country
at
home
said
edwin
they
were
walking
side
by
side
and
up
and
down
the
quadrangle
from
the
gym
to
the
swimming
bath
and
dozens
of
couples
were
crossing
and
recrossing
in
the
same
track
from
time
to
time
they
would
catch
a
few
words
of
conversation
eager
and
excited
as
they
passed
above
them
stretched
a
deep
sky
powdered
with
dust
of
gold
did
you
say
said
widdup
awfully
sorry
old
chap
i
catch
it
douglas
shouted
to
me
know
said
edwin
yes
hills
i
said
there
are
some
ripping
hills
at
home
one
called
these
hills
in
devonshire
got
to
get
out
of
the
trap
for
nearly
every
one
i
used
to
drive
my
uncle
it
was
awful
sport
think
i
was
rotting
but
the
chapel
bell
started
tolling
in
short
jerks
the
couples
began
to
drift
towards
the
northern
end
of
the
quad
where
the
gates
were
being
unbolted
for
five
minutes
exactly
the
gravel
of
the
wide
path
sloping
to
the
chapel
gave
out
a
grating
sound
beneath
the
pressure
of
many
hundred
feet
the
last
stragglers
hurried
in
the
master
on
duty
entered
the
porch
all
the
life
of
that
dark
mass
of
buildings
spread
upon
the
bare
edge
of
the
downs
became
concentrated
within
the
walls
of
the
chapel
its
stained
glass
windows
glowed
as
with
some
spiritual
radiance
inside
they
began
to
sing
the
hymn
which
is
used
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
by
rank
again
we
stand
from
the
four
winds
gathered
hither
loud
the
hallowed
walls
demand
whence
we
come
and
how
and
whither
and
from
the
open
doors
there
issued
a
faintly
musty
smell
as
though
indeed
the
dead
air
of
the
were
dispossessed
and
young
life
had
again
invaded
its
ancient
haunt
ii
it
seemed
to
edwin
from
the
first
as
though
the
concentrated
delights
of
this
summer
term
were
surely
enough
to
efface
every
memory
of
discomfort
and
suffering
that
had
clouded
his
early
days
at
he
was
exceptionally
happy
in
his
new
form
the
whose
name
was
cleaver
was
an
idle
man
with
a
young
wife
and
a
small
income
of
his
own
circumstances
that
combined
to
make
him
contented
with
the
conditions
of
servitude
at
which
weighed
so
heavily
on
the
disappointed
and
underpaid
selby
he
was
also
a
fine
cricketer
accepting
the
worship
which
was
the
prerogative
of
an
old
and
convinced
in
his
own
ever
that
kingdom
were
possessed
by
anything
so
positive
as
a
the
main
business
of
the
summer
term
was
cricket
the
atmosphere
of
the
with
its
alternations
of
strenuousness
and
summery
lassitude
pervaded
his
classroom
and
the
traditions
of
that
aristocratic
game
in
which
nobody
could
conceivably
behave
in
a
violent
or
unsportsmanlike
manner
regulated
his
attitude
towards
the
work
of
his
form
edwin
found
it
fairly
easy
to
keep
his
average
going
at
the
departments
of
the
game
in
which
cleaver
was
concerned
latin
and
greek
and
english
if
as
occasionally
happened
he
made
a
century
cleaver
was
ready
to
congratulate
him
as
a
sportsman
and
a
brother
to
be
beaten
by
some
yorker
of
tacitus
was
no
crime
if
he
had
played
with
a
straight
bat
and
slog
even
a
fool
who
could
keep
his
end
up
had
sympathy
it
was
not
only
in
a
spiritual
atmosphere
of
the
lower
fifth
that
edwin
found
content
the
classroom
which
the
form
inhabited
was
the
most
pleasant
in
the
whole
school
placed
high
with
a
overlooking
a
pleasant
lawn
that
a
poplar
overshadowed
beyond
the
lawn
lay
a
belt
of
dense
thickets
full
of
singing
birds
on
the
edge
of
which
laburnum
and
lilac
were
now
in
flower
so
that
when
innings
was
over
or
cleaver
was
gently
tossing
up
classical
lobs
to
the
weaker
members
of
the
form
he
could
let
his
eyes
wander
over
the
warm
air
of
the
lawn
to
plumes
of
purple
lilac
waving
in
the
summer
breeze
or
the
tops
of
the
avenue
of
leading
to
the
chapel
spire
even
in
the
heat
of
the
day
the
lower
fifth
classroom
was
cool
and
airy
visited
only
by
wandering
bees
and
scents
of
lime
and
lilac
beckoning
towards
a
golden
afternoon
the
term
was
full
of
lovely
animal
delights
the
luxury
of
flannels
and
soft
felt
hats
the
warmth
of
a
caressing
sun
the
contrast
of
cool
drinks
and
the
languors
of
muscular
fatigue
the
reviving
ecstasy
of
a
plunge
into
the
green
depths
of
the
swimming
bath
the
joy
of
extended
twilights
and
in
the
thin
air
of
evening
a
multitude
of
sounds
soothing
because
they
were
so
familiar
as
to
be
no
more
disturbing
to
consciousness
than
silence
voices
calling
in
the
fields
the
clear
click
of
bat
and
ball
the
stinging
echoes
of
the
great
days
great
days
edwin
found
himself
becoming
keen
on
indeed
from
any
ambitions
towards
excellence
though
the
mere
fact
of
sitting
at
feet
was
an
inspiration
but
for
the
sheer
joy
of
tiring
himself
at
the
nets
and
the
peculiar
charm
of
the
setting
of
sunburn
and
white
flannels
and
green
fields
cricket
was
a
part
of
this
divine
summer
and
therefore
to
be
worshipped
little
by
little
as
he
practised
he
found
he
was
beginning
to
improve
and
before
the
middle
of
the
term
he
was
developing
into
a
fair
bowler
of
medium
pace
and
had
taken
his
own
place
in
the
house
second
eleven
it
did
him
good
in
other
ways
for
in
this
capacity
he
found
that
he
was
at
length
accepted
naturally
and
without
any
exceptional
effort
on
his
part
so
miraculously
he
seemed
to
have
arrived
at
a
degree
of
normality
this
in
itself
was
a
triumph
spending
long
afternoons
with
his
team
in
the
lower
fields
he
found
that
he
could
feel
really
at
home
with
other
he
discovered
qualities
in
them
that
he
had
never
guessed
before
in
the
cricket
field
even
douglas
became
tolerable
no
longer
a
terrible
and
baleful
influence
with
scowling
brows
under
a
mop
of
black
hair
but
just
a
jolly
good
edwin
began
to
be
feverishly
interested
in
the
fortunes
of
the
second
eleven
kept
their
averages
produced
an
elaborate
table
of
league
results
conceived
a
secondary
but
violent
interest
in
the
progress
of
his
own
county
worcestershire
in
those
days
thanks
to
the
brilliancy
of
the
foster
rising
to
fame
sometimes
while
he
lay
on
the
grass
watching
his
own
side
bat
he
would
see
the
figure
of
old
fat
leeming
ambling
along
the
path
he
would
shrink
into
the
concealment
of
his
uniform
flannel
being
afraid
that
his
patron
would
speak
to
him
and
isolate
him
from
his
pleasant
company
leeming
was
not
fond
of
cricket
and
his
shadow
would
mar
this
particular
joy
only
when
he
had
passed
relief
would
come
great
days
great
days
iii
in
the
pursuit
of
these
joys
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
ingleby
forsook
his
friends
the
poets
in
the
flush
of
early
june
before
the
crowding
of
high
pomps
there
came
to
him
many
moments
of
ecstasy
in
the
spinney
at
the
back
of
the
head
house
there
was
a
nightingale
to
which
his
evening
dreams
were
dedicated
all
the
twilights
were
full
of
delicious
scents
and
sounds
of
all
other
times
he
remembered
most
clearly
certain
evenings
when
he
would
walk
all
alone
up
the
long
slope
of
the
from
the
chapel
hearing
the
whizzing
wings
of
the
cockchafers
that
made
their
home
in
the
shrubs
on
either
side
sunday
evenings
sundays
were
the
most
wonderful
days
of
all
not
indeed
because
the
chapel
services
made
any
religious
appeal
to
advances
of
leeming
had
scotched
that
long
because
of
the
peculiar
atmosphere
of
freedom
which
the
long
day
possessed
and
which
somehow
even
the
sermons
failed
to
mar
he
hated
the
sermons
he
hated
in
particular
the
sight
of
griffin
who
was
a
useful
member
of
the
choir
singing
like
any
cherub
a
solo
in
the
anthem
but
he
loved
the
music
and
particularly
the
psalms
with
which
the
daily
matins
and
evensong
made
him
so
familiar
that
he
help
knowing
many
of
them
by
heart
the
chants
to
which
the
psalms
were
sung
at
had
been
specially
composed
for
the
school
chapel
by
downton
the
organist
who
had
fitted
them
with
modulations
that
were
at
the
least
surprising
to
ears
which
could
not
be
happy
or
feel
secure
far
from
the
present
help
of
tonic
and
dominant
most
of
the
congregation
at
considered
that
tunes
were
rotten
at
first
they
were
inflicted
upon
the
choir
in
manuscript
but
in
second
summer
they
appeared
collected
in
a
slim
gray
volume
and
heal
who
acted
as
choirmaster
explained
that
they
were
the
results
of
the
most
careful
study
of
the
hebrew
text
of
ecstasies
and
the
deep
brooding
of
mind
it
gave
edwin
a
picture
of
sammy
with
his
gray
impassive
face
weaving
his
tunes
out
of
the
silence
of
the
night
by
candlelight
in
the
high
which
that
solitary
master
inhabited
and
for
this
alone
he
began
to
love
the
psalter
it
is
certain
at
any
rate
that
his
early
acquaintance
with
strange
harmonic
ideas
made
a
great
deal
of
the
most
modern
music
easy
to
him
in
after
years
later
in
north
bromwich
when
he
became
immersed
in
the
flood
of
wagner
he
often
wondered
whether
sammy
in
his
lonely
tower
had
known
these
wonders
and
cherished
them
up
there
all
by
himself
he
certainly
associate
that
sort
of
music
with
the
naïvetés
of
flute
and
yet
you
never
can
mr
heal
knew
his
then
there
were
sunday
walks
with
widdup
over
the
downs
under
a
grilling
sun
and
through
the
woods
of
york
park
where
griffin
and
douglas
poaching
had
encountered
keepers
but
the
glare
and
dryness
of
a
chalk
country
in
summer
does
not
invite
exercise
and
the
most
precious
hours
of
all
were
spent
on
the
sloping
banks
between
the
grand
entrance
and
the
chapel
here
early
on
a
sunday
morning
edwin
and
widdup
would
carry
out
an
armful
of
rugs
and
cushions
and
there
all
day
they
would
lie
in
the
shade
of
the
limes
reading
writing
letters
ingleby
always
had
a
letter
from
his
mother
to
answer
on
sundays
watching
the
restless
flight
of
little
copper
butterflies
seeing
the
hot
sky
deepen
to
an
almost
southern
blue
behind
the
pointed
gables
of
the
school
against
such
skies
the
red
brick
of
became
amazingly
beautiful
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
in
his
home
on
the
edge
of
the
black
country
the
sky
was
never
so
clear
and
deep
lying
there
he
would
read
the
books
that
he
had
smuggled
out
of
the
library
poetry
a
great
deal
of
it
novels
he
read
and
he
always
remembered
reading
of
mystery
and
murder
in
the
rue
morgue
pit
and
the
pendulum
masque
of
the
red
such
titles
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
leisure
of
those
days
with
the
middle
of
the
term
came
the
race
meeting
on
the
downs
during
the
whole
of
race
week
the
college
bounds
were
tightened
so
that
no
boy
dared
show
his
face
outside
the
iron
gates
within
the
short
memory
of
the
school
a
less
been
expelled
confronting
his
own
housemaster
on
the
edge
of
ring
on
wednesday
of
the
week
the
race
for
the
six
thousand
guineas
the
greatest
of
the
classics
was
to
be
run
within
its
closed
gates
buzzed
like
a
hive
in
every
house
and
every
form
there
were
sweepstakes
griffin
made
a
book
boasted
in
hall
that
he
meant
to
see
the
run
or
die
ingleby
very
nearly
admired
him
for
his
courage
the
great
day
came
all
morning
from
the
open
windows
of
the
lower
fifth
classroom
he
could
hear
the
rumble
of
loaded
brakes
climbing
the
downs
road
in
those
days
there
were
no
motors
but
white
dust
by
many
hundreds
of
wheels
filled
the
air
and
drifted
in
clouds
into
the
college
quad
from
a
high
wall
at
the
back
of
the
they
could
see
the
road
itself
and
the
unceasing
hot
procession
moving
upwards
brakes
full
of
men
who
carried
bookies
in
white
costers
with
buttons
as
big
as
driving
carts
drawn
by
little
donkeys
whose
thick
coats
were
matted
with
sweat
gipsies
out
to
prey
upon
the
rest
of
mankind
smart
gentlemen
in
gloves
driving
tandem
regimental
drags
all
the
road
was
full
of
dust
and
torn
paper
and
the
odour
of
beer
and
sweat
and
every
member
of
the
crowd
looked
anxiously
forward
as
though
he
feared
he
would
be
too
late
for
the
toward
the
summit
of
the
downs
where
the
grand
stand
like
a
magnificent
stood
up
white
against
the
sky
down
in
the
that
afternoon
nobody
thought
much
of
cricket
for
all
the
locked
iron
gates
the
eager
consciousness
of
the
crowd
on
the
downs
had
invaded
ingleby
was
scoring
for
his
own
innings
douglas
who
was
sitting
astride
of
a
bat
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
airy
summit
of
the
grand
stand
now
fringed
with
the
black
bodies
of
a
thousand
spectators
he
pulled
out
his
watch
off
he
said
god
i
envy
old
griff
ingleby
forgot
his
scoring
he
too
was
wondering
what
had
happened
he
could
imagine
it
easily
for
several
times
on
the
downs
he
had
crossed
the
tan
gallops
on
which
it
was
said
horses
from
the
royal
racing
stables
were
trained
and
seen
incredibly
slender
creatures
lithe
as
greyhounds
thundering
neck
and
neck
over
the
sprinkled
bark
he
could
think
of
nothing
swifter
or
more
exciting
on
earth
the
game
stopped
all
the
players
were
looking
at
the
grand
stand
as
though
their
eyes
could
tell
them
which
horse
had
won
two
minutes
three
from
the
top
of
the
downs
a
great
roar
came
down
to
them
some
monstrous
beast
no
congregation
of
men
was
roaring
there
the
black
fringe
on
the
grand
stand
became
animated
by
waving
arms
and
hats
and
sticks
a
cloud
of
tinier
specks
detached
themselves
these
were
the
carrier
pigeons
and
in
a
very
little
time
they
were
flying
high
above
the
seeing
no
doubt
the
black
mass
of
london
outstretched
so
many
miles
away
i
wish
i
could
shoot
one
said
douglas
never
heard
such
a
row
as
they
made
up
there
ingleby
lay
you
two
to
one
the
horse
has
that
evening
witnessed
the
canonisation
of
griffin
veritably
he
had
seen
the
guineas
a
crowd
of
admirers
listened
to
his
story
between
preps
in
the
house
classroom
his
manner
was
indolent
and
boastful
this
was
to
be
no
more
than
the
first
of
many
exploits
on
race
for
the
birches
would
be
run
he
had
put
the
money
he
had
won
over
the
guineas
on
a
horse
called
airs
and
graces
and
was
going
to
see
her
bring
his
money
home
ingleby
had
never
heard
the
name
of
this
horse
before
but
when
the
house
sweepstakes
for
the
birches
was
drawn
he
found
that
airs
and
graces
had
fallen
to
him
griffin
who
evidently
considered
that
this
destinies
were
in
his
keeping
offered
him
a
pound
for
his
ticket
ingleby
having
any
douglas
called
in
to
give
an
opinion
on
the
damnableness
of
that
skunk
sticking
to
a
sweepstake
ticket
for
which
he
had
been
given
a
fair
offer
agreed
it
was
a
bloody
shame
that
a
man
like
that
should
have
drawn
anything
but
a
blank
what
did
he
know
about
racing
racing
was
a
pastime
of
gentlemen
in
which
he
obviously
have
any
interest
did
ingleby
understand
that
griffin
was
going
to
see
the
race
itself
a
thing
that
he
would
never
have
the
guts
to
do
in
all
his
life
a
couple
of
years
before
ingleby
would
not
have
known
how
to
meet
the
coalition
it
is
possible
even
that
he
would
have
given
up
his
ticket
and
improbable
that
he
would
have
received
the
pound
that
griffin
offered
by
this
time
he
had
learnt
that
no
answer
at
all
was
better
than
the
softest
that
when
griffin
and
douglas
started
that
sort
of
game
the
best
thing
was
to
keep
his
temper
and
clear
out
as
quickly
as
possible
on
this
occasion
the
chapel
bell
saved
him
all
through
the
service
that
evening
he
was
pondering
on
words
trying
rather
obstinately
to
convince
himself
that
they
true
that
he
the
skunk
they
had
agreed
to
call
him
that
he
was
sufficiently
gentle
in
birth
to
have
an
interest
in
what
the
newspapers
called
sport
of
kings
that
at
a
pinch
he
might
summon
up
sufficient
to
emulate
the
boldness
of
such
a
daring
customer
as
griffin
perhaps
it
was
all
too
horribly
he
accept
it
it
was
inconceivable
that
all
the
attributes
of
knightly
courage
should
be
vested
in
people
like
griffin
and
yet
he
be
certain
that
he
deceiving
himself
it
was
so
easy
to
imagine
oneself
brave
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
the
worst
of
me
he
said
to
himself
can
imagine
anything
i
could
imagine
myself
hiring
a
coach
and
wearing
a
white
and
asking
old
fat
leeming
to
come
to
the
birches
with
me
on
friday
all
imagination
and
silly
rot
of
that
kind
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
no
damned
good
at
it
the
first
time
that
he
had
realised
defects
of
this
kind
term
after
term
he
had
been
reproaching
himself
for
the
lack
of
moral
or
physical
courage
there
was
only
one
way
out
of
it
to
prove
that
he
was
capable
of
the
things
which
he
feared
by
doing
them
in
this
way
he
had
driven
himself
to
batter
his
hands
to
pulp
by
playing
fives
without
gloves
for
this
he
had
taken
a
dive
into
the
deep
end
of
the
for
the
sole
reason
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
float
in
the
shallow
water
and
had
determined
to
swim
for
this
he
had
forced
himself
to
spend
long
hours
or
to
waste
long
hours
over
geometry
the
subject
that
he
hated
most
now
in
the
same
way
and
wholly
for
his
own
satisfaction
he
determined
to
go
to
the
birches
that
night
walking
up
and
down
the
quad
he
opened
the
subject
to
widdup
he
said
you
know
i
drew
airs
and
graces
in
the
house
sweep
griffin
offered
me
a
quid
for
the
should
jolly
well
let
him
have
it
said
widdup
explaining
the
mathematical
side
of
the
question
see
won
a
twenty
to
one
chance
already
the
chances
against
the
horse
winning
are
well
you
can
work
it
out
easily
do
it
for
you
in
second
prep
besides
old
griff
has
a
lot
of
money
on
the
horse
and
going
to
see
the
race
so
am
i
said
ingleby
widdup
laughed
and
that
annoyed
him
do
you
think
of
it
think
a
damned
fool
said
widdup
ingleby
left
it
at
that
perhaps
widdup
was
right
but
why
in
the
world
should
the
same
thing
count
for
heroism
in
the
case
of
griffin
and
folly
in
his
own
he
distrusted
the
mathematical
sense
of
proportion
in
any
case
he
had
to
go
through
with
it
if
he
no
subsequent
heroism
could
ever
persuade
him
that
he
a
coward
and
worthy
of
every
epithet
with
which
griffin
had
loaded
him
it
was
in
the
same
spirit
he
imagined
that
knights
in
the
ages
of
chivalry
had
set
themselves
to
perform
extravagant
tasks
that
saints
had
undergone
monstrous
privations
just
to
convince
themselves
that
they
as
deficient
in
as
they
feared
the
business
came
more
easily
than
he
had
expected
when
first
he
tied
himself
to
his
resolve
friday
at
was
a
on
friday
afternoon
that
is
to
say
there
were
no
organised
games
the
afternoon
prep
started
at
three
and
afternoon
school
at
the
great
race
he
learned
was
to
be
run
at
three
and
this
would
give
him
time
to
miss
the
hour
of
prep
which
was
not
supervised
and
to
be
ready
for
an
innings
of
greek
with
cleaver
an
easy
game
for
once
in
a
way
he
was
prepared
to
slog
like
blazes
up
to
the
last
moment
widdup
refused
to
think
that
he
would
go
through
with
it
he
believe
indeed
until
he
saw
edwin
climb
on
to
the
top
of
the
wooden
fence
in
the
spinney
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
drop
over
into
the
road
i
should
think
had
enough
of
it
said
widdup
the
old
man
came
along
and
saw
you
there
be
bunked
come
along
be
back
just
after
three
said
edwin
be
here
to
give
me
a
hand
over
right
said
widdup
are
a
bloody
fool
you
chapter
v
airs
and
graces
he
need
telling
that
with
every
step
the
conviction
was
borne
in
on
him
and
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
wooden
palings
that
marked
the
school
boundary
he
was
very
near
to
giving
up
his
enterprise
he
could
easily
so
easily
slip
over
the
hedge
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
and
wait
there
until
the
race
was
over
and
the
came
racing
down
the
hill
on
their
bicycles
bells
tingling
all
the
way
and
then
he
could
meet
widdup
at
the
appointed
place
and
say
that
he
had
seen
the
race
by
that
time
rumour
would
have
told
him
the
name
but
that
do
not
that
he
cared
whether
he
told
the
truth
or
a
lie
to
widdup
but
because
he
would
feel
such
a
wretched
coward
in
his
own
mind
he
had
got
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
possessed
the
moral
courage
which
he
doubted
it
was
only
the
existence
of
the
very
real
he
envisaged
not
only
his
own
expulsion
but
harrowing
scenes
of
remorse
and
distress
at
made
the
thing
a
fair
test
he
had
to
go
through
with
it
beyond
the
line
of
fencing
even
standing
in
midstream
of
that
determined
crowd
he
felt
himself
curiously
unprotected
he
did
a
curious
thing
he
turned
his
college
cap
with
its
circular
stripes
of
green
inside
out
presenting
to
the
world
a
dirty
brown
lining
this
enough
for
him
he
also
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
eton
coat
but
the
crowd
was
thinking
of
one
thing
only
and
none
seemed
to
notice
him
they
noticed
nothing
even
the
sellers
of
the
race
cards
and
the
tawny
gipsies
who
cried
for
a
piece
of
silver
to
cross
their
palms
and
promised
good
luck
were
unheeded
edwin
concealed
himself
or
imagined
some
measure
of
concealment
in
an
eddy
of
dust
between
a
heavy
wagonette
crammed
with
men
who
looked
like
licensed
victuallers
and
a
donkey
cart
he
found
that
by
holding
on
to
the
step
of
the
wagonette
he
felt
safer
it
was
reassuring
to
hold
something
what
a
rotten
coward
he
was
at
last
one
of
the
men
in
the
last
seat
of
the
wagonette
who
had
been
rolling
about
with
his
eyes
closed
opened
them
and
looked
at
edwin
they
were
curiously
watery
eyes
and
his
mouth
was
all
over
the
shop
when
he
had
dreamily
considered
the
phenomenon
of
edwin
for
a
little
while
he
addressed
him
look
young
it
hot
edwin
panted
said
the
man
in
the
wagonette
as
an
afterthought
he
took
a
bottle
of
beer
about
a
quarter
full
from
his
pocket
the
cork
came
out
with
a
pop
said
the
fat
man
and
chuckled
eh
he
took
a
swig
and
with
the
froth
fringing
his
moustache
offered
the
bottle
to
edwin
edwin
shook
his
head
said
the
fat
man
than
i
am
oh
well
if
he
continued
dreamily
and
finished
the
bottle
then
he
pitched
it
over
the
hedge
the
dust
was
terrible
on
either
side
of
the
track
the
hedges
and
banks
were
as
white
as
the
road
the
horses
pulled
well
and
even
hanging
on
the
step
edwin
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
with
them
at
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
driver
whipped
them
into
a
trot
edwin
let
go
the
step
and
was
cursed
fluently
by
the
coster
for
standing
in
the
way
of
his
his
friend
waved
him
he
found
himself
caught
up
in
a
stream
of
other
walkers
hurrying
in
a
for
the
grand
stand
now
distantly
visible
with
the
royal
standard
drooping
above
it
behind
him
and
in
front
the
black
snake
of
that
procession
stretched
sliding
literally
over
the
shiny
convolutions
of
the
down
that
the
feet
of
the
foremost
had
polished
and
moving
in
a
sort
of
vapour
of
its
own
compact
of
beer
and
strong
tobacco
and
intolerable
human
odours
from
the
crown
of
the
downs
edwin
looked
back
at
the
the
tiny
white
figures
at
the
nets
and
in
the
that
sometimes
stopped
in
their
play
to
watch
the
black
serpent
in
whose
belly
he
now
moved
they
seemed
very
too
near
to
be
comfortable
and
even
though
he
knew
that
nobody
down
there
could
possibly
see
him
he
felt
happier
when
a
billow
of
the
down
hid
the
plain
from
sight
it
was
only
when
he
reached
the
grand
stand
losing
himself
in
the
thick
of
the
crowd
that
clustered
about
it
that
he
began
to
feel
safe
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
that
he
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
a
little
old
man
in
seedy
black
clothes
grabbed
his
elbow
fiercely
sir
young
sir
he
said
my
advice
gratis
free
for
he
laughed
and
edwin
saw
gray
bristles
stretched
on
his
underlip
my
advice
never
expose
your
watch
at
a
myself
learnt
it
from
long
experience
my
own
and
my
never
even
take
a
watch
when
i
go
racing
no
i
leave
it
at
home
a
beautiful
by
benson
of
ludgate
hill
with
enamelled
face
you
take
my
advice
a
thing
to
always
remember
yes
edwin
seriously
thanked
him
a
roar
went
up
from
the
crowd
prince
the
prince
has
entered
the
royal
box
said
the
old
man
bless
he
raised
a
dusty
an
extraordinary
gesture
for
this
wrinkled
gnomish
creature
he
mumbled
handsome
benson
of
ludgate
hill
a
very
prominent
firm
we
shall
see
nothing
here
you
follow
edwin
followed
more
beer
more
tobacco
more
of
the
curious
composite
smell
more
positively
vegetable
than
human
that
he
had
begun
to
associate
with
trampled
pieces
of
paper
probably
the
debris
of
bags
that
had
once
held
fruit
of
some
kind
the
little
man
pushed
his
way
deftly
through
the
crowd
he
was
so
small
and
inoffensive
that
nobody
seemed
to
notice
him
and
indeed
the
leading
characteristics
of
this
vast
consciousness
seemed
to
be
good
humour
the
bookies
in
their
white
hats
the
costers
the
sweating
men
in
black
coats
the
very
waiters
in
the
refreshment
tents
staggering
under
leaning
towers
of
beef
plates
seemed
determined
to
enjoy
themselves
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
the
smell
of
their
neighbours
under
the
sky
edwin
too
forgot
his
anxieties
the
vastness
of
the
crowd
subtly
shielded
him
he
felt
newly
secure
and
his
spirit
was
caught
up
into
its
excitement
and
good
humour
he
even
turned
down
his
collar
and
all
the
time
his
mind
exulted
in
a
queer
sense
of
clarity
an
intoxication
due
perhaps
to
his
successful
daring
in
this
state
he
found
all
his
surroundings
vivid
and
amusing
all
colours
and
sounds
came
to
him
with
a
heightened
brilliancy
he
smiled
and
suddenly
found
that
a
young
gipsy
woman
with
her
head
in
a
bright
handkerchief
was
smiling
back
at
him
he
thought
it
was
jolly
that
people
should
smile
like
that
he
thought
what
jolly
good
luck
it
was
meeting
his
guide
the
shiny
shoulders
of
whose
frock
coat
he
saw
in
front
of
him
his
quick
mind
had
placed
the
little
man
already
a
clerk
in
some
ancient
inn
of
court
a
relic
of
the
dark
london
of
dickens
a
city
of
yellow
fog
and
cobbled
pavements
shining
in
the
rain
of
dusty
cobwebbed
windows
and
cosy
parlours
behind
them
where
kettles
were
singing
on
the
hob
of
a
toasting
fire
and
punch
was
mixed
at
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
have
met
no
more
suitable
person
than
his
friend
for
really
all
this
racing
crowd
were
making
a
sort
of
cockney
holiday
of
the
kind
that
the
greatest
victorian
loved
most
dearly
he
began
to
find
words
for
it
all
he
find
words
for
it
for
it
would
be
such
fun
writing
to
his
mother
about
it
if
he
it
would
be
time
enough
to
write
a
letter
about
it
when
the
business
was
finished
without
disaster
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
he
would
be
found
out
and
expelled
even
if
that
should
happen
he
thought
he
would
like
to
tell
his
together
they
passed
the
level
of
the
grand
stand
this
huge
erection
of
wood
provided
the
only
constant
landmark
for
edwin
was
not
tall
enough
to
see
above
the
shoulders
of
the
adult
crowd
in
which
he
was
moving
now
they
had
left
the
grand
stand
behind
it
seemed
that
they
must
surely
be
crossing
the
course
and
then
a
bell
clanged
and
the
crowd
parted
like
a
great
wave
of
the
red
sea
in
pictures
of
the
exodus
edwin
found
himself
clinging
to
the
of
his
friend
and
the
little
man
in
turn
hanging
on
as
if
for
his
life
to
a
whitewashed
post
from
which
the
next
wave
would
have
sucked
him
back
the
crowd
swayed
gently
settling
down
and
leaving
them
stranded
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
course
a
trick
worth
knowing
said
friend
opposite
them
the
stands
well
known
to
him
on
sunday
walks
as
a
vast
skeletal
erection
stood
clothed
in
flesh
and
blood
tier
upon
tier
of
human
faces
packed
one
above
the
other
looked
down
on
him
edwin
had
never
before
realised
how
pale
the
faces
of
men
and
women
were
from
the
midst
of
them
there
rose
a
ceaseless
murmur
of
human
speech
shrilling
occasionally
like
the
voices
of
starlings
when
they
whirl
above
an
autumn
reed
bed
and
then
as
suddenly
still
for
one
extraordinary
moment
they
were
nearly
silent
off
said
the
little
again
the
murmur
of
the
stands
arose
a
bookie
just
behind
them
was
doing
his
best
to
get
in
a
last
few
bets
entreating
proclaiming
passionately
the
virtues
of
old
his
red
face
lifted
above
the
crowd
and
while
he
shouted
saliva
dribbled
from
his
mouth
a
curious
roaring
sound
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
course
a
mile
or
more
away
he
stopped
with
his
mouth
open
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
something
had
happened
over
there
everybody
even
those
who
see
anything
turned
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
came
edwin
turned
with
them
he
imagine
why
and
when
he
turned
his
eyes
gazed
straight
into
those
of
miss
denning
the
matron
of
the
college
sanatorium
marvellously
dressed
for
the
occasion
and
leaning
upon
the
innocent
arm
of
mr
heal
thank
god
mr
heal
was
edwin
felt
himself
blushing
he
knew
for
certain
that
she
had
seen
and
recognised
him
for
his
sick
headaches
had
often
taken
him
to
the
sanatorium
and
he
had
always
been
rather
a
favourite
of
hers
she
stared
straight
at
him
and
her
eyes
never
wavered
obviously
the
game
was
up
he
fancied
that
her
lips
smiled
faintly
never
was
a
smile
more
sinister
edwin
had
an
impulse
to
bolt
simply
to
turn
tail
and
run
at
his
hardest
straight
back
to
the
college
he
do
that
between
him
and
escape
an
impassable
river
lay
the
parabola
of
yellow
grass
over
which
the
birches
was
even
now
being
run
feeling
almost
physically
sick
he
slipped
round
to
the
other
side
of
his
companion
he
wished
that
gnomish
creature
had
been
bigger
at
the
corner
if
you
lean
out
you
can
see
look
coming
into
the
straight
airs
and
graces
leading
down
they
come
the
finest
sight
in
the
civilised
edwin
see
them
he
saw
nothing
but
the
phantom
of
miss
eyes
her
faint
and
curiously
sinister
smile
he
wished
to
goodness
the
race
were
over
now
everybody
was
shouting
the
stands
rose
with
a
growl
like
great
beasts
heaving
in
the
air
something
incredibly
swift
and
strepitant
passed
him
in
a
whirl
of
wind
and
dust
the
crowd
about
him
and
the
heaving
stands
broke
into
an
inhuman
roar
the
little
old
man
beside
him
was
jumping
up
and
down
throwing
his
into
the
air
and
catching
it
again
the
whole
world
had
gone
shouting
and
laughing
mad
edwin
heard
on
a
hundred
lips
the
name
of
airs
and
graces
it
meant
nothing
to
him
now
he
could
only
think
of
escape
and
as
the
crowd
bulged
and
burst
once
more
over
the
course
he
made
a
dash
for
the
other
side
mounted
police
were
pressing
back
the
tide
but
edwin
was
small
and
quick
enough
to
get
over
he
pushed
and
wriggled
his
way
through
masses
to
which
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
only
in
the
rear
of
the
stands
the
density
of
the
crowd
thinned
then
he
broke
into
a
run
and
though
he
was
soaked
with
sweat
and
his
head
was
aching
fiercely
he
did
not
stop
running
until
a
billow
of
the
down
had
hidden
the
stands
from
sight
in
a
little
hollow
littered
with
tins
and
other
debris
and
choked
with
nettles
and
some
other
herb
he
lay
recovering
his
breath
and
for
the
first
time
thinking
beside
a
diminished
of
dirty
water
he
was
miserable
fate
now
brooded
over
him
as
heavily
as
the
sky
and
he
for
the
life
of
him
imagine
why
it
was
ridiculous
in
any
case
that
the
mere
sight
of
a
eyes
should
have
worked
so
extraordinary
a
miracle
yet
this
was
no
less
than
the
truth
suddenly
without
a
shadow
of
warning
all
the
happiness
and
light
and
colour
had
gone
out
of
his
adventure
that
which
had
been
at
least
magnificent
had
now
become
childish
or
nearly
silly
reflecting
he
be
satisfied
that
anything
was
changed
nothing
had
really
changed
except
himself
and
he
want
to
admit
that
he
had
changed
either
no
he
changed
only
his
mind
was
just
like
the
dewpond
at
his
feet
in
which
the
burning
sky
was
mirrored
some
days
it
would
be
blue
and
white
and
others
black
with
thunder
but
the
pool
would
be
just
the
same
to
be
more
miserable
now
than
i
was
when
i
came
up
here
and
then
apart
from
being
a
bit
funky
i
felt
none
of
these
sober
reflections
relieved
him
all
the
rest
of
the
way
back
he
felt
hunted
and
miserable
and
something
very
near
to
panic
seized
him
at
the
point
when
he
reached
the
college
palings
at
the
corner
looking
horribly
scared
widdup
was
waiting
goodness
come
he
said
then
he
suddenly
went
white
the
matter
cried
edwin
lord
the
the
voice
of
the
came
next
what
are
you
doing
here
let
me
it
a
topped
the
palings
this
this
what
are
you
doing
there
a
moment
of
brilliant
inspiration
and
i
were
fooling
sir
and
he
chucked
my
cap
over
the
fence
may
i
get
it
sir
serious
muttered
the
head
letter
of
the
law
out
of
bounds
you
out
of
bounds
boys
have
been
expelled
for
less
yes
expelled
ruin
your
whole
edwin
saw
that
he
was
in
a
good
humour
saw
in
the
same
flash
the
widdup
white
with
fear
sorry
sir
he
said
what
were
you
two
doing
here
wanted
to
get
some
poplar
leaves
for
my
rather
lamely
in
the
fourth
stage
they
the
head
smiled
possibly
because
he
approved
of
this
fervent
manifestation
of
what
the
conference
called
study
possibly
at
sudden
revelation
of
schoolboy
psychology
decidedly
he
approved
of
the
he
had
been
reading
fabre
aloud
to
his
wife
fabre
too
was
a
schoolmaster
poor
devil
he
did
not
speak
his
thoughts
schoolmasters
never
can
he
said
me
see
ingleby
in
the
lower
fifth
must
speak
to
cleaver
he
say
what
he
must
speak
about
along
with
he
left
them
walking
away
with
his
hands
joined
behind
his
back
supporting
an
immense
flounce
of
black
silk
gown
edwin
scrambled
over
the
fence
his
hands
as
they
clutched
the
top
of
it
were
trembling
violently
you
are
a
prize
liar
said
widdup
the
old
man
believed
every
word
of
know
said
edwin
the
rotten
part
of
it
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
know
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
meant
won
and
won
the
ten
minutes
later
he
was
back
in
classroom
trying
to
make
himself
so
inconspicuous
that
he
be
called
upon
to
make
an
exhibition
of
himself
and
as
luck
would
have
it
nothing
of
any
difficulty
came
his
way
to
drag
him
from
his
comfortable
obscurity
even
though
the
intense
excitement
of
his
adventure
had
now
faded
the
atmosphere
of
that
high
room
had
changed
he
felt
that
he
somehow
belong
to
it
or
rather
that
he
had
left
something
behind
all
through
that
drowsy
hour
some
part
of
him
was
still
being
hurried
over
the
hot
downs
swept
along
in
the
sweating
crowds
of
the
racecourse
and
this
circumstance
made
his
present
life
strangely
unreal
as
though
he
were
a
changeling
with
whom
it
had
nothing
in
common
gradually
very
gradually
the
old
conditions
reasserted
themselves
but
it
was
not
until
the
insistent
discipline
of
the
evening
service
in
chapel
had
dragged
him
back
into
normality
that
his
adventure
and
the
influence
of
the
strange
people
with
whom
he
had
rubbed
shoulders
began
to
fade
widdup
with
his
unblushing
admiration
helped
there
was
no
shutting
him
up
you
have
a
nerve
he
said
wonder
what
do
next
stow
it
said
edwin
finished
with
that
sort
of
thing
not
cut
out
for
a
think
how
you
did
can
i
it
was
damned
silly
of
me
i
just
wanted
to
satisfy
myself
that
that
i
had
some
guts
you
know
i
really
care
what
you
chaps
thought
about
it
it
was
sort
of
chapter
vi
thunder
weather
i
that
night
a
thrilled
but
incredulous
dormitory
discussed
the
exploit
of
ingleby
without
pretending
to
have
approached
the
dizzy
achievements
of
griffin
edwin
perceived
that
in
addition
to
reassuring
himself
he
had
managed
to
atone
for
a
little
of
his
former
reputation
he
found
himself
treated
with
something
that
was
almost
respect
partly
for
the
daring
of
the
whole
expedition
but
even
more
for
the
crowning
achievement
of
his
inspired
lie
wish
you
told
them
that
he
said
to
widdup
not
said
widdup
was
the
best
part
of
think
so
i
mind
telling
a
lie
but
rotten
if
the
chap
you
tell
it
to
believes
out
said
widdup
you
want
to
know
the
truth
only
another
example
of
your
rotten
why
why
why
he
understand
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
most
natural
decent
things
in
the
world
were
all
labelled
as
abnormalities
even
if
he
had
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
he
possessed
the
usual
amount
of
it
seemed
that
he
was
a
kind
of
freak
there
was
no
getting
to
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
yet
when
he
came
to
consider
himself
he
was
certain
that
his
attitude
was
infinitely
humble
perhaps
that
was
the
trouble
other
chaps
think
about
themselves
edwin
envied
them
unfeignedly
he
felt
that
he
was
condemned
to
travel
a
sort
of
vicious
circle
thus
if
he
were
honest
to
himself
he
was
bound
to
fail
in
the
ordinary
normal
standard
and
to
be
considered
if
not
a
prig
an
oddity
if
by
enormous
efforts
he
were
to
compel
himself
into
the
trodden
ways
of
thought
and
conduct
he
be
in
the
process
of
regaining
his
honesty
he
found
himself
fighting
his
way
back
to
the
original
misfortune
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
isolated
he
must
be
he
determined
above
all
things
that
even
if
he
were
not
ashamed
of
his
isolation
he
be
proud
of
it
it
easy
the
whole
incident
of
the
after
all
he
had
meant
for
a
sort
of
private
becoming
a
nuisance
he
almost
welcomed
the
attitude
of
griffin
who
scoffed
at
the
whole
business
and
refused
to
believe
he
had
been
there
griffin
his
own
reputation
for
valour
and
cunning
being
in
question
determined
to
prove
that
edwin
had
not
been
near
the
race
in
the
dormitory
that
night
the
coalition
set
themselves
to
this
business
beginning
with
an
examination
at
the
hands
of
griffin
himself
says
you
went
to
see
the
birches
he
said
edwin
none
of
your
fooling
ingleby
a
damned
little
liar
you
never
put
your
nose
near
the
it
matter
to
you
it
soon
know
that
it
does
not
going
to
have
any
liars
in
this
house
better
tell
the
truth
at
right
then
i
did
go
to
the
swine
get
a
towel
you
asked
going
to
prove
that
a
liar
of
course
you
know
that
already
but
you
ought
to
be
shown
up
for
your
own
good
then
get
a
tight
six
what
were
airs
and
colours
know
what
his
colours
griffin
howled
listen
to
the
swine
he
know
a
horse
from
a
mare
duggie
ingleby
how
do
you
tell
a
horse
from
a
mare
edwin
blushing
was
overwhelmed
with
laughter
by
this
time
the
towel
was
ready
wet
and
twisted
into
a
cable
teach
you
the
colours
of
airs
and
graces
said
griffin
had
quite
enough
of
your
airs
and
graces
here
next
time
find
it
pays
to
tell
the
truth
in
this
edwin
got
his
six
having
been
bent
double
over
the
end
of
his
own
bed
by
the
other
seekers
after
truth
it
was
worth
it
when
the
lights
were
out
and
he
was
comfortably
settled
in
bed
he
decided
that
that
sort
of
thing
to
make
any
difference
mind
to
me
a
kingdom
is
he
said
to
himself
and
in
his
mind
the
great
guts
question
had
been
settled
for
ever
as
for
the
well
it
might
have
been
a
gym
while
he
lay
thinking
of
these
things
he
was
surprised
to
hear
the
voice
of
widdup
who
slept
next
to
him
speaking
in
a
whisper
say
he
said
you
really
go
to
the
birches
or
were
you
pulling
my
leg
course
i
did
he
replied
it
gave
him
a
little
shock
to
find
that
so
slight
a
thing
as
a
display
of
physical
violence
had
shaken
faith
glad
of
that
came
apologetic
whisper
a
long
silence
won
the
sweep
anyway
said
widdup
and
edwin
grunted
you
reckon
that
be
here
four
more
years
taking
into
account
the
number
of
you
go
in
for
the
house
sweep
every
year
you
could
calculate
the
exact
chances
against
your
he
was
asleep
ii
and
while
he
slept
after
that
day
of
unusual
excitement
and
fierce
colour
he
had
a
curious
dream
in
the
beginning
it
reflected
a
little
of
the
anxieties
of
the
afternoon
for
he
found
himself
hurrying
in
the
middle
of
a
huge
and
sweaty
crowd
which
made
no
way
for
him
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
running
so
violently
but
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
and
this
was
that
he
was
going
to
be
late
at
first
he
had
in
front
of
him
the
little
man
in
the
rusty
coat
who
had
been
his
companion
on
the
downs
the
same
queer
creature
now
endowed
with
an
aspect
even
more
grotesque
and
an
agility
more
elfish
so
that
edwin
knew
from
the
first
that
this
time
he
was
sure
to
lose
him
and
never
to
catch
him
up
again
all
the
masses
of
people
through
whom
he
pressed
were
moving
even
faster
than
himself
and
in
the
same
direction
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
never
gain
ground
at
all
but
must
go
on
running
for
ever
with
no
sight
of
his
goal
nor
any
hope
of
getting
nearer
to
it
at
last
his
breath
gave
out
and
he
stopped
it
a
bit
of
good
for
the
moving
crowd
stop
with
him
and
he
was
pushed
forward
by
this
multitude
of
tall
people
knowing
that
if
he
faltered
for
a
moment
or
fell
as
in
the
end
he
must
he
would
certainly
be
trampled
to
death
by
the
feet
of
those
who
followed
at
last
the
little
man
outstripped
him
altogether
and
feeling
that
he
had
lost
all
hope
edwin
gave
a
cry
when
he
cried
out
the
whole
hurrying
crowd
melted
away
the
noise
of
their
padding
footsteps
left
a
clear
patch
of
silence
it
was
like
that
and
a
puff
of
cool
thin
air
blew
suddenly
right
into
his
nostrils
he
thought
not
going
to
be
late
after
why
they
tell
me
that
i
was
going
to
uffdown
there
was
no
air
like
that
in
the
world
he
drank
it
down
in
gulps
as
a
horse
drinks
water
choke
yourself
his
mother
light
last
much
why
should
it
last
darling
he
replied
got
to
look
over
there
she
said
the
west
you
see
that
level
ridge
dropping
suddenly
well
the
third
farm
from
the
end
do
you
see
darling
i
can
see
it
quite
clearly
and
he
did
see
it
a
long
building
of
bluish
stone
with
small
windows
set
flush
in
the
walls
and
no
dripstones
save
one
above
the
oak
doorway
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
it
looked
as
if
the
place
had
been
deserted
by
living
creatures
for
many
years
can
see
it
he
said
i
think
anybody
lives
you
can
see
it
she
asked
him
eagerly
you
see
the
little
bedroom
window
on
the
third
from
the
a
little
window
it
was
difficult
to
see
for
after
all
it
was
more
than
a
hundred
miles
away
and
all
the
time
that
he
was
looking
the
streamers
of
cloud
kept
rolling
down
from
the
darens
on
the
mountain
and
drenching
the
whole
scene
in
mist
not
much
time
she
pleaded
tell
he
said
can
see
the
window
you
she
sighed
so
glad
eddie
i
did
want
to
show
it
why
were
you
in
such
a
hurry
was
my
last
chance
of
showing
it
to
do
you
mean
darling
she
turned
her
face
away
now
it
was
quite
dark
really
dreaming
he
thought
this
is
a
sort
of
stage
on
which
they
can
do
lightning
tricks
like
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
being
uffdown
all
round
the
sky
the
of
the
were
flickering
out
and
though
he
see
her
face
he
could
feel
her
soft
hand
in
his
any
rate
written
she
said
at
last
that
was
the
sentence
which
he
carried
in
his
mind
when
he
awoke
a
letter
but
she
usually
write
to
him
before
sunday
and
it
was
now
only
saturday
yet
when
he
came
into
hall
for
breakfast
a
letter
was
lying
on
his
plate
there
was
something
so
strange
about
the
whole
business
that
he
was
almost
afraid
to
open
it
he
had
a
sudden
awful
intuition
that
she
was
dead
ridiculous
of
course
for
dead
people
write
letters
smiling
at
himself
yet
scarcely
reassured
he
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
darling
she
wrote
you
really
make
must
be
getting
laura
has
just
been
in
to
we
talked
such
a
lot
that
i
have
only
just
time
to
write
this
before
father
goes
down
to
business
and
can
post
have
some
very
interesting
news
for
other
afternoon
willis
of
mawne
came
in
to
see
and
lilian
are
going
to
switzerland
for
a
month
this
now
she
suggests
that
i
should
join
them
be
just
i
i
should
be
back
again
before
your
wants
me
to
been
very
the
doctor
says
sure
it
would
do
me
my
life
wanted
to
see
most
awfully
excited
about
father
says
he
can
spare
it
be
are
going
about
the
end
of
forget
that
postal
rather
poor
myself
just
at
you
keep
my
think
i
should
like
you
double
stocks
which
father
planted
in
the
long
bed
are
just
coming
of
course
nothing
in
spite
of
the
news
of
the
swiss
excursion
could
be
more
ordinary
that
would
be
wonderful
for
her
of
course
it
would
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
reasonable
convictions
he
get
that
dream
out
of
his
head
something
he
felt
sure
was
going
wrong
he
tried
to
analyse
the
source
of
his
disquietude
jealous
he
thought
he
was
most
awfully
jealous
of
anything
that
other
people
had
to
do
with
his
mother
and
anyway
he
know
these
willis
people
very
well
they
were
new
friends
of
hers
a
family
of
wealthy
whose
works
had
suddenly
risen
in
the
year
of
the
war
and
were
now
slowly
but
gigantically
expanding
they
lived
at
mawne
hall
a
sad
but
pretentious
mansion
of
the
departed
pomfrets
of
which
edwin
knew
only
the
gates
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
drive
they
had
a
son
edward
of
very
much
the
same
age
as
himself
but
the
willises
had
no
great
educational
ambitions
that
was
where
mother
came
in
and
had
sent
him
to
the
ancient
but
decaying
grammar
school
of
halesby
an
impossible
concern
in
the
eyes
of
any
the
willises
had
pots
of
money
here
again
edwin
suspected
them
it
rather
looked
as
if
they
had
his
mother
and
nobody
on
earth
had
the
right
to
do
that
he
hated
the
willises
and
particularly
edward
in
advance
he
always
hated
people
he
met
when
he
heard
too
much
about
them
he
thought
that
the
new
intimacy
probably
had
something
to
do
with
his
aunt
laura
who
was
diffuse
and
fussy
and
ornate
and
not
a
patch
on
his
mother
nobody
was
a
patch
on
his
mother
he
get
rid
of
his
anxiety
and
so
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
before
morning
school
he
answered
her
letter
darling
go
to
switzerland
with
a
lot
of
strangers
if
you
do
go
i
feel
that
i
shall
never
see
you
again
he
wrote
he
knew
it
be
any
good
she
reasonably
do
anything
but
smile
at
his
fancies
but
he
help
it
he
even
took
the
trouble
to
post
the
letter
in
the
box
at
the
grand
entrance
so
as
to
make
certain
that
he
change
his
mind
on
the
way
into
the
classroom
he
met
griffin
who
pushed
a
packet
into
his
hand
you
are
he
said
it
was
shillings
in
silver
the
first
prize
in
the
house
sweep
on
the
birches
he
wished
he
had
remembered
about
it
he
would
have
told
his
mother
in
the
letter
not
to
bother
about
the
postal
order
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
think
of
her
being
and
himself
rolling
in
this
prodigious
and
fortune
the
morning
class
was
listless
for
the
weather
remained
at
a
great
pitch
of
heat
and
the
only
thing
that
any
one
thought
of
was
the
fixture
with
the
which
would
begin
at
noon
cleaver
always
assisted
as
umpire
at
this
match
and
so
the
deserted
lower
fifth
occupied
a
corner
of
the
big
schoolroom
by
themselves
in
this
great
was
said
that
the
was
as
wide
as
any
in
dreamed
away
the
morning
reading
sometimes
the
gilt
lettering
on
the
boards
on
which
the
names
of
scholars
were
recorded
giants
who
had
passed
before
him
along
the
same
corridors
and
whose
names
were
only
memorable
as
those
of
heroes
in
a
mythology
or
more
ponderably
evident
in
reports
of
parliamentary
debates
and
the
scores
of
county
cricket
teams
opposite
him
hung
the
board
devoted
to
the
winners
of
entrance
scholarships
his
own
name
was
there
edwin
ingleby
he
remembered
the
day
when
it
had
almost
embarrassed
him
with
its
fresh
gold
lettering
now
the
leaf
had
toned
down
and
the
name
had
sunk
into
obscurity
beneath
a
dozen
others
so
the
passage
of
fleet
time
was
measured
on
these
tables
in
a
few
more
years
nobody
who
take
the
trouble
would
read
his
name
even
those
of
the
batch
before
him
were
in
obscurity
one
other
name
arrested
him
giles
he
knew
nothing
of
giles
except
that
this
brilliant
beginning
had
been
followed
by
disaster
the
name
of
giles
appeared
on
no
other
board
for
the
term
before
edwin
came
to
giles
had
been
expelled
from
the
school
edwin
know
what
he
had
been
expelled
for
but
the
circumstance
remembered
afflicted
him
with
a
kind
of
awe
might
happen
so
easily
he
thought
why
if
he
lied
to
the
head
the
day
before
he
might
have
been
expelled
himself
and
years
afterwards
some
one
sitting
in
his
place
would
stare
at
the
name
of
ingleby
with
the
selfsame
awe
the
voice
of
leeming
stuck
fast
where
edwin
had
left
him
a
year
before
in
the
stuart
period
recalled
him
will
pass
over
the
unpleasant
most
unpleasant
side
of
charles
the
reign
unfortunately
he
was
a
thoroughly
bad
man
and
his
court
edwin
heard
no
more
but
he
heard
another
sound
peculiar
to
the
big
schoolroom
on
saturday
mornings
the
measured
steps
of
the
school
sergeant
plodding
down
the
long
stone
corridor
which
led
to
the
folding
doors
on
saturday
morning
the
presented
their
weekly
reports
to
the
head
and
boys
whose
names
came
badly
out
of
the
ordeal
were
summoned
to
the
office
to
be
lectured
to
be
put
on
the
sort
of
probation
known
as
or
even
to
be
caned
the
lower
fifth
knew
none
of
these
terrors
cleaver
was
far
too
to
take
his
weekly
report
seriously
but
the
lower
ranks
of
form
trembled
you
could
never
be
sure
of
old
leeming
the
folding
doors
opened
leeming
stopped
speaking
and
the
sergeant
walked
up
to
his
desk
and
stood
waiting
at
attention
while
leeming
read
his
list
he
looked
over
his
glasses
me
see
sherard
he
said
the
wishes
to
see
you
at
his
voice
was
so
gently
sympathetic
that
nobody
could
possibly
imagine
that
he
had
had
anything
to
do
with
this
calamity
the
lower
fifth
he
fumbled
with
the
paper
the
will
see
you
at
the
same
he
looked
over
at
edwin
with
the
most
pained
surprise
good
sergeant
he
said
edwin
felt
himself
going
white
yes
that
was
it
that
was
the
explanation
of
his
feeling
of
unrest
he
was
going
to
share
the
fate
of
the
traditional
giles
good
lord
think
of
it
miss
denning
had
done
this
and
yet
he
could
hardly
believe
had
always
been
far
too
nice
for
that
now
his
face
was
burning
it
struck
him
that
it
a
bit
of
good
worrying
if
it
if
it
for
his
mother
it
really
be
so
bad
he
bear
to
think
of
her
disappointment
in
his
disgrace
she
thought
so
much
of
him
it
be
quite
so
bad
if
she
were
not
ill
it
might
kill
her
good
god
that
would
be
awful
suppose
after
all
it
was
no
good
supposing
that
the
head
wanted
to
see
him
about
something
there
anything
else
unless
unless
it
were
something
to
do
with
his
mother
unless
she
were
seriously
ill
even
something
worse
but
he
had
her
letter
it
be
that
yesterday
she
was
well
enough
to
write
to
him
no
the
story
was
out
and
he
was
going
to
be
expelled
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
would
know
the
worst
he
wished
that
the
time
would
pass
more
quickly
time
had
never
been
so
slow
in
passing
the
clock
in
the
tower
chimed
the
quarter
from
where
he
sat
he
could
see
the
tower
through
the
upper
lights
of
the
long
window
he
could
see
the
give
a
little
lurch
and
move
infinitesimally
forward
he
remembered
widdup
telling
him
exactly
how
many
times
it
moved
to
the
minute
was
it
twice
or
three
times
he
had
forgotten
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
clock
in
the
middle
of
this
purgatory
one
fancy
came
to
him
any
rate
old
griff
will
know
that
i
did
go
to
the
races
iii
they
waited
ten
or
twelve
of
them
in
the
twilight
of
the
passage
outside
the
study
the
atmosphere
of
this
place
resembled
that
of
a
crypt
or
more
the
keynote
of
the
architecture
was
baronial
rather
than
dungeon
the
only
light
that
came
to
them
entered
by
way
of
certain
dusty
windows
of
lancet
shape
on
either
side
of
the
gothic
porch
beneath
these
windows
languished
a
pale
array
of
botanical
specimens
rotting
in
their
test
tubes
and
bearing
witness
to
the
zeal
of
the
particular
section
of
the
natural
history
society
they
waited
a
miserable
company
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
some
who
knew
the
worst
with
a
rather
exaggerated
jauntiness
determined
to
make
the
best
of
it
others
such
as
edwin
being
in
doubt
of
their
fate
and
burdened
with
a
spiritual
apprehension
far
worse
than
any
physical
penalty
which
might
overtake
them
the
sergeant
opened
the
door
he
said
sherard
crammed
a
sweaty
cap
into
his
pocket
and
started
forward
eager
to
get
it
over
the
aperture
which
admitted
him
showed
no
more
than
the
end
of
a
table
crammed
with
books
a
number
of
shelves
a
polished
floor
covered
with
turkey
carpet
and
a
blaze
of
mocking
sunshine
the
nails
in
the
heels
of
sherard
boots
rang
on
the
stone
flags
when
he
reached
the
turkey
carpet
his
steps
became
silent
the
door
closed
the
rest
of
them
strained
to
listen
they
heard
little
nothing
but
the
quiet
rumour
of
the
voice
and
little
patches
of
silence
in
which
the
replies
of
sherard
were
not
heard
at
all
a
moment
later
he
emerged
a
number
of
whispered
questions
assailed
him
but
sherard
feel
like
answering
questions
he
brushed
by
the
rest
of
them
as
quickly
as
he
could
go
with
his
pressed
to
his
eyes
another
patch
of
sunlight
was
revealed
called
the
sergeant
and
frazer
a
tall
lout
of
a
boy
with
sallow
face
came
forward
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
same
way
as
sherard
a
minute
later
the
sound
of
dull
blows
was
heard
got
it
said
somebody
two
three
four
five
six
poor
old
frazer
from
the
head
equal
to
three
from
cleaver
you
should
see
biceps
in
the
one
by
one
the
members
of
the
crowd
entered
and
returned
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
his
turn
would
never
come
all
the
time
that
he
waited
his
imagination
accursed
gift
was
playing
with
the
hidden
scene
within
the
long
table
that
he
had
seen
only
once
before
and
at
the
head
of
it
the
lean
bearded
figure
in
the
silk
gown
wielding
an
absolute
power
of
life
and
death
like
god
in
the
old
testament
yes
it
was
just
like
that
he
remembered
a
minatory
text
that
hung
cobwebbed
in
one
of
the
attics
at
home
prepare
to
meet
thy
god
it
was
not
pleasant
to
hear
these
muffled
sounds
of
chastisement
but
what
was
a
flogging
the
favourite
word
compared
with
the
more
devastating
fate
that
awaited
him
why
keeping
me
till
last
he
thought
said
the
sergeant
edwin
had
time
to
fancy
that
his
tone
implied
a
more
awful
enormity
than
he
had
put
into
any
other
name
he
entered
and
stood
waiting
in
the
sunlight
it
was
rather
less
frightening
than
he
had
imagined
this
long
room
relatively
luxurious
and
the
pale
man
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
his
lined
face
and
the
peculiar
twitching
of
his
left
arm
which
had
always
added
to
the
sinister
side
of
his
equipment
for
a
moment
he
took
no
notice
of
edwin
then
he
looked
up
and
smiled
would
the
storm
never
break
hope
your
entomological
zeal
going
to
take
you
up
to
the
racecourse
ingleby
how
are
the
getting
on
he
smiled
again
and
showed
his
teeth
beneath
his
shaggy
moustache
edwin
was
seized
with
a
sudden
terror
the
worst
had
happened
and
now
the
head
was
playing
with
him
he
could
say
nothing
the
matter
with
you
you
faint
are
you
better
sit
edwin
trembled
into
a
chair
are
you
all
right
sent
for
you
ingleby
because
i
have
been
having
a
talk
with
what
in
the
world
had
old
fat
leeming
to
do
with
it
edwin
wished
he
would
get
it
over
leeming
has
always
given
me
good
reports
of
you
i
know
if
you
deserve
them
and
last
night
i
saw
cleaver
who
um
um
tells
me
that
you
are
one
of
no
leave
that
part
out
that
got
plenty
of
brains
when
you
choose
to
use
them
but
that
you
are
somewhat
lacking
in
application
why
he
get
to
the
point
says
ingleby
that
a
dreamer
well
you
know
no
use
for
dreamers
in
this
world
not
wanted
even
dreamers
with
the
blessing
of
good
brains
leeming
is
satisfied
and
so
am
i
that
if
you
chose
to
make
an
effort
and
take
a
a
healthy
interest
in
things
we
might
do
some
good
with
you
you
might
win
scholarships
and
be
a
credit
to
the
school
what
we
want
what
your
parents
sent
you
here
for
now
now
leeming
tells
me
that
you
aspire
to
becoming
a
priest
of
the
church
but
leeming
told
me
he
had
talked
the
matter
over
with
you
mentioned
it
sir
but
i
say
anything
i
think
i
do
want
to
the
head
frowned
mean
that
you
feel
worthy
of
so
great
a
vocation
well
young
a
promising
boy
i
want
to
do
what
is
best
for
you
and
the
school
at
the
end
of
this
term
you
are
likely
to
get
a
move
and
after
a
certain
time
i
think
from
the
scholarship
point
of
view
you
can
begin
to
specialise
too
early
you
have
shown
a
certain
aptitude
for
english
you
might
read
history
you
might
stick
to
classics
what
do
you
think
about
it
should
like
to
read
history
well
write
to
your
father
about
it
we
say
anything
more
about
the
church
for
the
present
that
will
come
later
i
expect
leeming
will
talk
it
over
with
you
you
may
go
chapter
vii
impurity
i
the
leeming
would
certainly
have
called
not
take
place
for
a
long
time
for
the
reverend
mind
had
become
exercised
with
a
problem
of
greater
importance
than
the
devotion
of
edwin
it
exactly
his
fault
leeming
was
a
bachelor
he
was
now
in
his
year
naturally
endowed
with
an
intense
shyness
of
disposition
which
the
forced
publicity
of
his
two
professions
in
the
pulpit
and
the
classroom
had
overlaid
with
a
veneer
of
suave
assurance
he
was
none
the
less
a
man
of
ardent
if
timid
passions
he
himself
had
always
been
aware
of
this
powerful
sensual
element
in
his
nature
with
a
certain
degree
of
courage
he
had
subjected
it
to
a
deliberate
mortification
obstinately
he
had
fitted
his
body
to
the
procrustean
couch
that
his
conscience
recommended
obstinately
and
in
a
degree
successfully
not
quite
successfully
for
his
original
appetites
were
unwieldy
and
if
they
had
been
coerced
in
one
direction
they
had
undoubtedly
and
demonstrably
overflowed
in
another
as
witnessed
the
growing
expanse
of
his
waistcoat
this
waistcoat
on
of
broadcloth
and
on
sundays
of
a
more
sensual
silk
was
the
symbol
of
possibilities
he
know
it
even
if
he
were
aware
in
the
lacing
of
his
boots
of
its
physical
existence
he
the
least
idea
of
its
spiritual
significance
if
he
had
realised
this
if
he
had
been
content
to
see
himself
as
he
actually
stood
upon
the
brink
of
his
morning
bath
instead
of
as
a
snowy
surpliced
priest
of
god
or
a
knightly
figure
in
the
armour
of
sir
percivale
such
indeed
was
his
christian
name
leeming
might
have
been
a
healthier
and
a
happier
man
as
it
was
the
devil
that
he
believed
he
had
conquered
in
reality
possessed
his
soul
in
his
quest
for
the
thing
which
he
had
labelled
purity
he
had
unconsciously
allowed
the
idea
of
to
become
an
obsession
in
the
activities
of
a
parish
hustled
by
the
continual
accidents
of
stark
life
and
stabilised
by
the
actual
responsibility
of
a
wife
and
an
increasing
family
leeming
might
have
become
a
thinner
and
a
wiser
man
in
the
sedentary
and
monotonous
duties
of
a
public
school
he
had
become
gradually
more
fat
and
introspective
and
as
the
years
advanced
more
perpetually
conscious
of
the
unashamed
presence
throughout
human
nature
of
his
own
suppressed
desires
frightened
and
more
curious
of
their
terrible
existence
and
more
terrible
power
leeming
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
was
in
a
bad
way
a
number
of
circumstances
favoured
the
development
of
the
unfortunate
obsession
in
the
last
easter
holidays
he
had
attended
a
conference
of
assistant
masters
in
london
at
which
the
whole
question
had
been
discussed
with
the
greatest
solemnity
and
plans
had
been
formulated
for
the
stamping
out
of
in
every
public
school
in
england
the
speeches
of
the
delegates
had
convinced
him
of
his
own
blindness
it
was
impossible
that
should
be
so
very
different
from
any
other
public
school
yet
other
people
had
assured
the
meeting
that
in
their
own
schools
the
disease
was
and
leeming
had
returned
to
his
summer
duties
convinced
that
if
only
he
looked
with
sufficient
care
more
ills
than
he
had
ever
suspected
might
be
found
he
had
become
a
man
with
a
mission
for
a
crusade
of
this
kind
was
not
by
any
means
an
ideal
field
the
for
all
his
imposing
presence
was
not
a
practical
man
he
was
intolerant
of
enthusiasms
in
his
staff
not
so
much
because
they
were
symptomatic
of
but
because
they
tended
to
disturb
the
pleasant
ordered
tenor
of
his
life
croquet
and
botany
were
sciences
of
more
interest
to
him
than
education
he
believed
in
hard
games
corporal
punishment
nature
study
and
the
classics
he
hated
extremes
the
golden
mean
was
his
creed
his
weakness
and
his
apology
he
any
use
for
intensities
he
could
even
be
picturesque
on
occasion
you
are
going
to
appoint
yourself
inspector
of
our
dirty
linen
leeming
he
said
really
expect
me
to
do
the
think
you
understand
me
sir
leeming
i
said
the
head
the
word
impurity
formed
voicelessly
on
lips
is
a
scandalous
thing
scandalous
he
complained
to
the
a
man
who
knows
what
is
right
and
is
determined
to
follow
it
be
properly
backed
by
the
headmaster
the
matter
is
vital
it
is
the
most
important
by
far
the
most
important
problem
in
modern
education
any
means
are
justified
to
purge
the
schools
of
this
sort
of
thing
can
see
you
leeming
drawled
selby
the
rôle
of
the
exploded
is
wanted
in
the
public
schoolmaster
is
a
higher
sense
of
seriousness
leeming
spluttered
have
no
sense
of
is
more
wanted
in
the
public
schools
said
cleaver
a
suspicion
of
you
fellows
talk
said
downton
if
the
whole
thing
were
a
problem
for
the
public
schools
purely
and
simply
nothing
of
the
kind
not
the
ignorance
of
the
average
schoolmaster
as
much
as
the
ignorance
of
the
average
parent
i
mean
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
boys
lack
of
sympathy
lack
of
responsibility
and
when
ugly
things
happen
they
shove
it
on
to
what
they
pay
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
for
said
cleaver
which
we
see
any
too
much
selby
growled
of
you
take
it
seriously
the
thing
is
enormous
said
leeming
can
you
expect
in
a
way
of
improvement
when
a
housemaster
like
selby
makes
jokes
about
it
convinced
that
only
one
you
drive
boys
got
to
understand
their
got
to
understand
their
bodies
said
cleaver
leeming
flushed
think
you
are
merely
disgusting
quite
right
said
downton
sexual
education
it
moral
instruction
going
to
work
the
miracle
when
a
boy
reaches
a
certain
it
the
same
age
with
all
begins
to
be
conscious
and
quite
properly
of
his
physical
passions
you
shudder
leeming
they
exist
you
know
they
exist
as
well
as
anybody
well
when
he
reaches
that
stage
a
public
school
the
proper
place
for
games
would
go
to
pot
said
cleaver
from
his
point
of
view
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
depends
entirely
on
your
boy
some
are
too
old
at
seventeen
some
are
perfectly
safe
at
nineteen
the
trouble
is
that
just
when
you
get
them
in
sight
of
these
dangers
you
put
them
in
supreme
authority
a
prefect
can
do
pretty
well
as
he
likes
the
essence
of
the
system
responsibility
said
selby
gives
them
what
shaw
said
about
something
else
the
maximum
of
inclination
with
the
maximum
of
said
cleaver
fellows
are
too
deep
for
me
anyway
i
believe
much
wrong
here
so
he
swung
out
of
the
room
kind
of
man
said
leeming
at
the
root
of
the
whole
downton
was
almost
angry
know
leeming
talking
bosh
the
solving
itself
all
over
the
world
schoolboys
are
getting
wider
interests
at
school
in
their
homes
taking
a
more
equal
place
in
family
life
it
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
being
seen
and
not
heard
being
treated
like
human
beings
the
more
you
treat
them
like
human
beings
the
less
likely
they
are
to
behave
like
young
animals
and
the
greatest
mistake
of
all
is
to
keep
on
talking
to
them
about
it
every
boy
of
a
certain
age
is
curious
and
quite
naturally
curious
about
his
physical
possibilities
so
is
every
girl
dear
downton
said
leeming
flushing
shall
be
obliged
if
you
the
subject
you
make
it
painful
well
said
downton
gathering
up
the
skirts
of
his
gown
leeming
left
the
room
selby
smiled
lazily
only
he
said
only
our
friend
leeming
had
ever
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
a
really
bad
ii
unconscious
of
the
doom
which
was
being
forged
for
their
chastisement
in
the
white
heat
of
troubled
brain
the
school
lay
scattered
along
the
perimeter
of
the
waiting
for
the
players
to
emerge
from
the
pavilion
they
came
and
the
great
expanse
of
green
was
made
more
beautiful
by
their
scattered
figures
everything
in
the
game
seemed
spacious
and
smooth
and
white
flannels
of
the
players
the
paler
green
of
the
rolled
pitch
the
new
red
ball
the
sharp
click
of
the
bat
before
lunch
the
school
had
lost
three
wickets
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
a
stand
were
to
be
made
the
studious
carr
the
head
of
house
was
batting
steadily
while
gilson
the
most
showy
batsman
who
would
play
for
surrey
in
the
holidays
was
beginning
to
get
set
edwin
and
widdup
had
their
side
by
side
and
douglas
for
want
of
griffin
absent
on
some
deeper
business
had
pitched
himself
near
them
reclining
upon
a
positive
divan
of
downy
cushions
the
winnings
of
the
house
sweepstake
easily
gained
and
therefore
easily
to
be
spent
supplied
the
natural
accompaniment
of
ices
and
ginger
beer
or
that
inimitable
compound
of
both
that
was
known
as
the
strawberry
cooler
under
such
circumstances
the
mere
fact
of
lazy
existence
was
a
pleasure
even
when
the
cautious
carr
was
bowled
the
long
partnership
ended
and
the
wickets
began
to
fall
like
autumn
leaves
the
serene
beauty
of
the
day
was
scarcely
clouded
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
figure
of
leeming
drifted
along
the
edge
of
the
field
he
halted
on
the
path
immediately
in
front
of
edwin
with
his
back
to
the
spectators
considerably
incommoding
view
of
the
play
a
friend
of
yours
he
ingleby
said
douglas
lazily
might
tell
him
that
he
made
of
but
leeming
suddenly
aware
of
a
voice
behind
him
turned
and
came
towards
them
smiling
ingleby
he
said
that
you
he
sat
on
the
grass
beside
them
very
carefully
as
befitted
a
man
of
his
figure
beautiful
day
let
me
see
who
are
we
playing
yes
the
marylebone
cricket
club
are
you
fond
of
cricket
ingleby
course
i
am
very
seldom
see
you
now
the
pity
of
it
the
better
a
boy
is
the
less
you
see
of
him
he
passes
through
your
form
quickly
and
the
end
of
it
and
how
is
widdup
widdup
was
very
well
if
a
little
impatient
and
ingleby
are
great
friends
widdup
quite
inseparable
often
seen
you
walking
up
and
down
the
quad
at
night
i
wonder
what
it
is
you
have
in
common
eh
widdup
know
always
been
pals
always
slept
alongside
each
other
that
was
how
you
got
to
know
a
chap
ingleby
what
are
you
reading
in
these
days
hit
sir
oh
well
make
it
five
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
think
reading
anything
in
slowly
it
became
evident
to
leeming
that
the
audience
which
he
had
honoured
with
his
company
was
bored
with
great
dignity
he
picked
himself
up
and
left
them
a
funny
old
swine
said
douglas
used
to
think
he
was
rather
decent
said
edwin
you
trust
him
said
douglas
always
feel
as
if
up
to
some
business
or
other
he
goes
mooching
about
in
those
old
felt
slippers
of
his
and
you
never
know
where
he
is
the
other
day
he
came
into
the
long
when
griff
and
i
were
there
playing
nap
you
tell
he
was
coming
like
a
damned
old
tomcat
i
think
how
you
stick
him
ingleby
really
edwin
confessed
old
griff
says
he
follows
him
like
a
shadow
just
lately
taken
to
haunting
the
i
know
what
he
goes
there
for
he
never
used
to
he
never
goes
in
i
suppose
the
fat
beast
can
could
float
said
the
practical
widdup
the
golden
afternoon
dragged
out
its
lovely
length
the
atmosphere
of
luxurious
indolence
grew
so
heavy
that
it
became
too
great
an
effort
to
think
of
carrying
the
rugs
and
back
to
the
studies
and
when
douglas
had
left
them
to
keep
an
appointment
with
griffin
widdup
and
edwin
sat
on
till
the
meadows
swam
with
soft
golden
light
till
the
tops
of
the
pyramidal
became
the
colour
of
their
blossoms
and
the
sun
cast
long
shadows
upon
the
yellow
fields
in
this
delightful
hour
the
sounds
of
the
match
from
which
excitement
had
faded
almost
as
the
fierceness
had
faded
from
the
sky
became
no
more
than
a
placid
accompaniment
to
the
dying
day
at
stumps
were
drawn
the
wide
fields
began
to
empty
and
soon
no
life
was
seen
upon
them
but
low
dipping
swallows
who
skimmed
the
smooth
lawn
as
though
it
were
the
surface
of
some
placid
lake
upon
the
hillside
a
straggling
trail
of
boys
could
be
seen
taking
home
their
rugs
and
cushions
as
though
they
were
returning
from
a
day
of
toil
instead
of
one
of
the
most
exquisite
idleness
on
said
widdup
at
last
shall
be
late
for
and
indeed
another
twenty
minutes
found
them
assembled
in
the
oak
pews
for
evensong
they
sang
the
a
canticle
which
for
all
the
rest
of
his
life
edwin
associated
with
the
placid
closing
of
a
summer
day
and
the
mild
rays
of
the
departing
sun
blazed
through
the
stained
glass
of
the
west
window
upon
the
pale
mosaic
of
the
nave
when
they
emerged
from
the
chapel
the
sun
had
set
the
skyline
of
the
downs
lay
low
and
almost
cold
and
cockchafers
were
whirring
blindly
among
the
sticky
tops
of
the
conifers
along
the
chapel
path
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
that
stuck
congested
in
the
porch
edwin
found
himself
wedged
between
douglas
and
griffin
they
whispered
together
behind
his
back
are
you
going
course
going
i
told
fixed
it
up
with
her
up
to
any
sport
why
you
come
with
us
company
on
with
you
can
easily
pick
up
another
not
a
sportsman
take
risks
of
that
kind
you
bet
your
boots
i
why
you
ask
ingleby
a
blood
says
he
went
to
see
the
birches
and
flush
too
won
the
griffin
scoffed
bet
you
funk
what
said
edwin
down
town
a
fair
on
taking
the
skivvy
from
j
dorm
all
right
she
knows
a
thing
or
talk
so
loud
you
ass
said
douglas
will
you
come
i
said
edwin
said
you
went
to
the
did
go
to
the
nobody
believes
you
your
chance
to
show
your
pluck
come
along
gentlemen
show
your
three
to
one
bar
you
are
sir
the
old
and
trusted
firm
ingleby
you
are
a
rotten
little
funk
edwin
said
nothing
got
more
sense
than
you
have
anyway
griff
said
douglas
that
night
in
the
dormitory
when
the
lights
were
turned
down
griffin
had
not
appeared
douglas
who
slept
next
to
him
had
constructed
by
means
of
his
own
bolster
and
another
confiscated
from
the
bed
of
the
small
boy
on
whom
the
animosity
of
the
coalition
was
now
chiefly
lavished
a
very
plausible
imitation
of
prostrate
figure
as
griffin
habitually
slept
in
a
position
which
enabled
him
to
absorb
his
own
fugginess
this
was
not
difficult
when
edwin
went
to
sleep
griffin
had
not
arrived
drugged
with
fresh
air
he
slept
untroubled
by
any
dream
in
the
middle
of
the
night
as
it
seemed
he
awoke
not
because
he
had
heard
any
sound
but
rather
because
he
had
become
aware
in
his
sleep
of
some
unusual
presence
he
did
not
move
but
slowly
opened
his
eyes
and
all
he
saw
was
the
figure
of
selby
gigantically
tall
clad
in
a
long
of
turkish
towelling
and
carrying
a
lighted
candle
that
cast
a
shadow
even
more
gigantic
on
the
whitewashed
walls
he
moved
slowly
and
his
bedroom
slippers
made
no
sound
on
the
boarded
floor
opposite
the
foot
of
and
bed
he
paused
for
a
moment
edwin
closed
his
eyes
he
felt
the
eyelids
quiver
why
on
earth
should
selby
want
to
look
at
him
he
passed
on
and
edwin
cautiously
opening
his
eyes
saw
him
pause
again
opposite
the
gap
between
douglas
and
griffin
at
this
point
he
waited
longer
he
appeared
to
be
thinking
he
passed
on
and
then
suddenly
turned
back
and
gently
lifted
the
sheet
from
pillow
gently
he
replaced
it
edwin
was
almost
too
sleepy
to
realize
that
griffin
there
but
when
he
did
the
first
thought
which
came
into
his
mind
was
one
of
spontaneous
and
inexplicable
loyalty
he
thought
old
griff
in
for
and
yet
if
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
against
whom
he
had
a
reasonable
excuse
for
hatred
very
silently
selby
left
the
dormitory
edwin
became
conscious
of
the
ghostly
noises
of
the
night
a
spinning
in
the
wood
at
the
back
of
the
schoolhouse
the
boom
of
a
cockchafer
that
some
enthusiast
had
captured
and
imported
into
the
dormitory
the
clock
in
the
high
turret
struck
twelve
the
chime
wandered
clanging
over
the
empty
quadrangle
iii
the
next
week
was
the
most
sensational
that
had
ever
shaken
the
placid
life
of
the
fall
of
griffin
was
no
startling
he
had
been
for
it
and
the
escapade
of
the
fair
in
was
no
more
than
a
crowning
glory
still
it
was
an
impressive
affair
immediately
after
breakfast
next
morning
it
was
whispered
that
griffin
had
been
sent
to
the
infectious
ward
in
the
sanatorium
which
was
always
devoted
by
reason
of
its
size
rather
than
any
conscious
attempt
at
symbolism
to
the
isolation
of
moral
leprosy
it
became
edwin
after
his
vision
of
visit
in
the
night
had
taken
it
for
griffin
was
to
be
in
the
afternoon
douglas
faithfully
prowling
near
his
prison
had
seen
griffin
splendidly
unrepentant
at
the
high
window
of
his
condemned
cell
griffin
had
smiled
griffin
evidently
give
a
damn
for
the
whole
business
the
house
thrilled
of
such
stuff
heroes
were
made
it
remained
to
be
seen
in
the
opinion
of
the
critical
how
griffin
would
shape
in
the
supreme
test
of
the
scaffold
on
which
he
would
probably
be
birched
before
the
assembled
school
the
betting
was
all
on
being
a
sportsman
there
followed
a
day
of
suspense
consultations
between
masters
were
noticed
selby
for
a
whole
hour
had
been
closeted
with
the
head
old
fat
leeming
had
been
sent
for
at
last
to
join
their
deliberations
what
had
leeming
to
do
with
it
other
housemasters
had
been
summoned
to
the
room
beneath
the
clock
and
emerged
with
unusually
serious
faces
who
was
this
griffin
that
his
fate
should
shake
the
foundations
of
olympus
the
head
indeed
showed
his
seriousness
more
clearly
than
all
the
others
he
arrived
late
in
chapel
where
the
service
had
waited
on
his
coming
he
stalked
up
the
aisle
as
full
of
omen
as
any
black
crow
with
his
pale
seamed
face
and
his
shaggy
black
beard
and
his
arms
crossed
behind
his
back
beneath
the
skirts
of
his
gown
from
his
high
seat
at
the
end
of
the
chancel
he
scowled
on
the
whole
school
as
if
he
hated
it
at
supper
a
message
was
read
out
the
school
would
assemble
by
classes
in
the
big
schoolroom
at
noon
poor
old
the
sergeant
it
was
said
had
been
seen
binding
a
new
birch
in
the
lodge
it
was
all
very
romantic
and
thrilling
edwin
conscious
now
for
the
first
time
of
the
extreme
foolhardiness
of
his
racecourse
adventure
felt
himself
a
greater
dog
than
ever
and
then
when
the
stage
was
set
and
the
audience
attuned
to
an
atmosphere
of
tragedy
by
so
much
griffin
from
whom
the
glamour
of
the
heroic
had
been
gradually
fading
in
the
shame
of
his
captivity
achieved
the
dramatic
he
bolted
with
a
ladder
of
knotted
sheets
he
climbed
down
the
waterspout
and
disappeared
into
open
country
griffin
lived
somewhere
in
kent
in
half
a
day
he
would
reach
home
for
house
it
was
a
great
morning
edwin
in
spite
of
his
hatred
of
griffin
shared
in
the
general
elation
such
private
feuds
were
small
concerns
in
the
face
of
the
common
enemy
douglas
was
flown
with
insolence
knew
old
griff
would
do
them
he
said
god
a
man
if
you
like
the
nastiest
knock
old
had
in
his
life
think
of
it
a
chap
with
a
weak
heart
like
old
griff
shinning
down
a
waterspout
edwin
wondered
if
the
meeting
in
the
big
schoolroom
would
be
off
or
whether
perhaps
it
would
be
postponed
and
griffin
hauled
back
from
the
bosom
of
his
family
to
go
through
with
it
silly
ass
said
douglas
course
they
fetch
him
back
done
them
but
the
morning
went
on
without
any
alteration
in
the
programme
at
twelve
the
solemn
procession
began
the
whole
population
of
filtering
through
narrow
corridors
and
the
wide
folding
doors
into
the
big
schoolroom
the
whole
business
was
impressive
for
nobody
spoke
and
no
sound
came
from
the
crowd
but
the
drag
of
feet
and
arms
that
brushed
one
another
they
were
like
a
flock
of
sheep
driven
away
from
market
on
a
narrow
road
between
dusty
hedges
for
none
of
them
knew
what
was
coming
rumour
was
busy
with
whispers
griffin
had
been
found
in
a
ditch
with
his
leg
broken
and
had
been
hauled
back
to
fulfil
his
sentence
like
monmouth
edwin
thought
griffin
in
company
with
the
pale
skivvy
from
had
been
arrested
by
the
police
at
waterloo
other
rumours
less
credible
as
for
instance
that
cleaver
meeting
a
jockey
friend
of
his
in
a
little
pub
called
the
grenadier
in
the
downs
road
had
walked
into
a
taproom
full
of
school
house
bloods
on
sunday
morning
indeed
these
were
strenuous
days
the
school
settled
down
the
head
lean
flapped
the
wings
of
his
gown
he
seemed
to
find
it
difficult
to
make
a
beginning
and
while
he
waited
for
a
word
his
left
arm
twitched
then
he
began
it
was
obvious
that
his
pause
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
rhetorical
trick
designed
to
fix
the
attention
of
an
audience
already
thrilled
by
uncertainty
he
at
a
loss
for
words
at
all
he
boomed
he
ranted
he
bellowed
he
rolled
his
and
his
eyes
the
masters
sitting
at
their
high
desks
remained
discreet
and
rather
bored
all
except
leeming
to
whom
the
orator
appeared
as
an
inspired
prophet
of
god
for
the
subject
of
his
harangue
was
own
impurity
and
the
whole
meeting
the
immediate
result
of
investigations
the
curtain
had
gone
up
with
a
most
theatrical
flourish
upon
the
great
smut
row
the
essence
of
the
speech
was
a
general
threat
certain
things
had
been
discovered
certain
further
inquiries
were
to
be
made
the
fate
of
a
large
number
of
boys
lay
in
the
balance
more
details
were
known
in
all
probability
than
any
of
the
victims
suspected
to
the
youngest
among
them
he
made
a
special
appeal
confession
immediate
confession
would
be
the
better
part
of
valour
he
looked
to
every
member
of
the
school
to
aid
him
in
the
task
the
sacred
duty
of
purging
of
this
abominable
thing
indeed
it
is
possible
that
he
meant
what
he
said
his
port
was
bad
and
he
knew
better
than
to
drink
it
but
the
heady
vintage
that
he
brewed
from
sonorous
words
knocked
him
over
every
time
the
meeting
dissolved
in
silence
for
the
moment
the
school
was
impressed
less
by
the
gravity
of
the
charge
than
by
its
indefiniteness
the
same
evening
brought
tales
of
segregated
suspects
of
tearful
and
terrible
interviews
in
the
rooms
of
housemasters
of
prefects
suspended
of
a
veritable
reign
of
de
and
the
rest
of
citizen
house
dormitory
and
the
others
in
charge
of
the
languid
selby
suffered
least
when
evening
came
to
set
a
term
to
rumours
only
two
were
black
douglas
and
an
insignificant
inky
creature
of
the
name
of
hearn
whom
the
threats
of
the
headmaster
had
driven
to
some
grubby
confession
an
atmosphere
of
immense
relief
fell
upon
the
awed
dormitory
and
found
vent
in
a
memorable
but
edwin
did
not
sleep
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
have
slept
but
he
help
feeling
against
reason
that
in
some
way
he
might
be
dragged
into
the
toils
of
vengeance
that
some
peculiar
combination
of
circumstances
might
implicate
him
in
the
business
even
though
he
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
it
somehow
appearances
might
be
against
him
in
particular
he
became
suspicious
of
attentions
to
him
in
the
past
he
imagined
that
the
wily
creature
had
suspected
him
and
tried
for
that
reason
to
find
a
way
into
his
confidence
what
other
explanation
could
there
be
his
avoidance
of
leeming
could
only
have
increased
the
suspicion
plainly
he
was
done
for
he
remembered
with
a
perilous
clearness
words
that
had
passed
between
them
to
which
he
had
given
no
thought
now
they
appeared
terribly
significant
and
ingleby
are
great
friends
widdup
leeming
had
said
only
a
few
days
before
inseparable
often
seen
you
walking
up
and
down
the
quad
at
night
i
wonder
what
you
have
in
common
eh
now
edwin
knew
why
he
wondered
and
widdup
like
a
damned
fool
had
said
that
they
slept
alongside
each
other
supposing
old
leeming
it
was
too
bad
he
lay
there
staring
at
the
rafters
and
wondering
what
could
be
done
he
would
like
to
write
to
his
mother
about
it
but
a
man
write
to
his
mother
about
a
thing
like
that
and
his
father
understand
in
the
end
he
determined
that
the
only
thing
he
could
possibly
do
was
to
go
and
see
leeming
next
day
and
assure
him
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
their
friendship
then
he
thought
old
beast
believe
me
think
that
gone
to
him
because
i
have
a
guilty
conscience
and
suspect
me
more
than
ever
go
and
make
all
sorts
of
inquiries
and
something
will
come
out
that
will
be
difficult
to
how
could
anything
come
out
when
there
anything
wrong
he
could
not
give
a
reasonable
answer
to
this
question
and
yet
he
was
afraid
from
this
spiritual
purgatory
of
his
own
making
he
passed
into
an
uneasy
sleep
next
morning
in
the
middle
of
early
school
the
sergeant
entered
with
a
message
for
cleaver
and
waited
while
the
master
read
it
he
said
at
last
selby
wants
to
speak
to
you
you
had
better
go
at
edwin
packed
up
his
books
with
trembling
hands
he
went
very
white
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
eyes
of
the
whole
form
were
on
him
they
were
thinking
another
of
them
ingleby
who
would
have
thought
it
he
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
sergeant
go
echoing
down
the
corridor
as
steadily
and
implacably
as
the
fate
that
was
overtaking
him
he
only
wanted
to
get
it
over
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
classroom
he
ran
for
every
moment
of
uncertainty
was
torture
to
him
he
ran
across
the
quad
and
climbed
the
stairs
breathless
to
the
low
room
still
steeped
in
stale
honeydew
where
his
life
at
had
begun
and
must
now
so
abruptly
end
selby
sat
at
his
desk
waiting
for
him
when
edwin
entered
the
room
he
looked
suddenly
embarrassed
and
fingered
an
envelope
on
his
desk
i
sent
for
you
urgently
probably
came
as
a
shock
to
you
or
perhaps
you
were
prepared
you
must
pull
yourself
together
you
guess
what
it
is
but
he
could
it
came
to
him
suddenly
huge
and
annihilating
swamping
in
the
space
of
a
second
all
the
uneasiness
and
terror
that
had
shadowed
him
in
the
night
those
things
were
nothing
nothing
sir
my
mother
your
mother
ingleby
sorry
to
be
the
bearer
of
bad
news
very
sorry
me
sir
dead
oh
dead
selby
unfolded
the
telegram
although
he
already
knew
its
contents
not
so
bad
as
that
but
ill
very
ill
the
minute
you
spoke
i
knew
sir
had
better
catch
the
eight
train
at
the
downs
station
you
need
only
take
your
little
bag
you
can
get
it
from
the
matron
sir
you
any
money
selby
almost
smiled
to
see
him
so
eager
to
go
only
about
go
without
money
you
know
a
sovereign
now
cheer
up
a
good
fellow
cheer
up
he
smiled
wanly
and
edwin
burst
into
tears
selby
laid
an
awkward
hand
on
his
shoulder
it
was
very
decent
of
him
edwin
thought
as
he
stood
with
his
fists
in
his
eyes
one
of
them
clutching
the
sovereign
that
selby
had
given
him
you
sir
but
awful
awful
course
of
course
he
shepherded
edwin
out
of
the
room
when
the
boy
had
gone
selby
an
unemotional
man
tore
the
telegram
into
small
pieces
and
placed
them
with
a
confirmed
tidiness
in
the
basket
then
he
lit
a
pipe
of
honeydew
and
the
blue
smoke
from
the
bowl
together
with
the
brown
smoke
that
he
expelled
from
his
nostrils
shone
cheerily
in
the
morning
sun
that
beat
through
the
latticed
window
on
to
a
photograph
standing
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
he
gazed
at
the
faded
image
he
had
not
thought
of
her
for
years
chapter
viii
homewards
in
a
morning
air
of
miraculous
freshness
edwin
left
the
quad
by
the
iron
gates
on
the
eastern
side
the
square
was
quite
empty
for
all
its
usual
inhabitants
were
now
in
early
school
he
noticed
an
unusual
aspect
of
space
and
cleanliness
he
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
it
empty
before
he
noticed
the
in
the
corner
by
the
this
too
was
closed
and
the
windows
were
heavily
shuttered
it
was
a
small
thing
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
people
put
up
their
shutters
or
pulled
down
their
blinds
when
some
one
lay
dead
in
a
house
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
sort
of
omen
he
said
to
himself
must
think
of
something
else
i
must
think
of
something
else
i
bear
the
only
other
time
when
he
had
ever
thought
of
death
had
been
a
single
moment
a
week
or
so
before
when
his
mother
had
written
about
her
plan
of
a
visit
to
switzerland
and
then
the
thought
had
been
no
more
than
an
indefinite
shadow
too
remote
to
be
threatening
now
it
was
different
the
threat
was
ponderable
and
vast
i
think
of
it
i
must
think
of
something
he
had
to
think
of
something
else
for
by
the
time
the
gate
clanged
behind
him
the
clock
in
the
tower
struck
the
quarter
and
he
knew
that
he
had
barely
time
to
catch
his
train
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
he
started
running
up
the
road
between
the
tufted
grassy
banks
past
the
scene
of
his
last
adventure
the
oak
paling
beside
the
spinney
past
the
last
of
the
new
villas
and
so
on
to
the
open
downs
it
was
a
strange
adventure
for
him
to
reach
them
so
early
in
the
morning
their
turf
was
silvered
still
with
a
fine
dew
that
made
it
even
paler
than
a
chalk
down
should
be
fold
beyond
beautiful
fold
they
stretched
before
him
the
woody
belts
of
beech
and
pine
lay
veiled
in
milky
mist
and
the
air
which
moved
to
meet
him
as
it
seemed
over
that
expanse
of
breathing
grass
was
of
an
intoxicating
coolness
and
sweetness
which
went
to
his
head
and
made
him
want
to
shout
or
sing
the
spring
of
a
summer
morning
in
the
spring
of
life
it
was
all
wrong
surely
no
awful
devastation
of
death
could
overshadow
such
an
ecstasy
of
physical
happiness
he
refused
to
believe
it
it
was
all
fantastic
nonsense
of
course
she
dead
your
mother
die
without
your
feeling
at
the
station
he
had
five
minutes
to
spare
he
changed
his
sovereign
and
was
relieved
to
be
rid
of
the
responsibility
of
one
coin
and
to
fill
his
pocket
with
silver
there
were
several
coppers
in
the
change
and
these
he
placed
in
a
machine
extracting
several
metallic
ingots
of
chocolate
cream
he
was
ready
for
these
at
once
for
his
only
breakfast
had
been
a
hurried
cup
of
tea
and
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
in
the
room
the
train
jolted
out
of
the
station
and
soon
he
was
travelling
eastward
with
the
high
of
dipping
gradually
beneath
a
long
horizon
the
morning
grew
more
beautiful
in
some
strange
way
its
beauty
seemed
to
have
got
into
his
blood
for
he
tingled
with
a
kind
of
mild
ecstasy
which
he
help
feeling
irreverent
to
the
tragic
occasion
there
was
adventure
in
it
and
the
added
charm
of
the
unexpected
he
was
going
home
surely
it
was
reasonable
enough
to
be
excited
at
such
a
prospect
as
that
to
smell
the
fine
summer
scents
that
were
so
different
in
a
midland
shire
to
see
the
gorse
ablaze
on
pen
beacon
and
uffdown
and
the
green
glades
of
the
old
mercian
wood
of
course
it
was
always
wonderful
to
be
going
home
he
remembered
other
homecomings
from
the
first
and
best
of
all
when
on
a
december
morning
they
had
crowded
into
the
room
where
selby
sat
in
his
with
a
gaslight
flaring
handing
out
the
little
paper
packets
of
travelling
money
how
the
damp
platform
at
the
station
had
been
crowded
with
human
happiness
and
such
a
holiday
spirit
of
independence
that
griffin
and
douglas
had
lighted
cigarettes
while
they
waited
for
the
train
that
was
the
town
station
he
reflected
that
he
had
only
once
before
been
to
the
downs
where
the
train
service
except
on
race
days
was
not
so
good
that
had
been
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
for
the
scholarship
exam
he
had
come
down
in
an
eton
suit
fortunately
correct
and
an
unfortunate
topper
that
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
hide
when
he
found
that
they
were
not
worn
and
his
mother
had
come
down
with
him
at
the
thought
of
her
the
old
numbing
dread
fell
upon
his
heart
perhaps
this
was
the
very
carriage
in
which
they
had
travelled
he
remembered
the
journey
so
well
how
she
had
sat
in
the
corner
with
her
face
to
the
engine
wearing
a
grey
coat
and
skirt
a
velvet
hat
and
a
veil
he
had
been
looking
at
her
rather
critically
for
he
was
anxious
that
she
should
seem
what
she
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
and
when
he
was
looking
at
her
with
this
in
his
mind
she
had
smiled
at
him
for
no
other
reason
in
the
world
probably
but
that
she
loved
him
and
with
that
smile
he
had
been
satisfied
that
she
really
was
beautiful
and
he
had
noticed
how
lovely
her
hands
were
when
she
took
her
gloves
now
the
memory
of
the
moment
made
him
want
to
cry
just
as
the
beauty
of
the
morning
made
him
full
of
exultation
it
was
a
most
perilous
mixture
of
emotions
by
this
time
the
region
of
downs
had
been
left
far
behind
they
were
gliding
more
smoothly
it
seemed
through
the
park
country
of
the
home
counties
stations
became
more
frequent
and
the
train
began
to
fill
with
business
people
hurrying
to
london
for
their
work
they
settled
themselves
in
their
carriages
as
though
they
were
confident
that
their
seats
had
been
reserved
for
them
they
were
all
rather
carefully
rather
shabbily
dressed
the
cuffs
of
their
coats
were
shiny
and
the
cuffs
of
their
shirts
fringed
and
one
of
them
a
gentleman
with
a
by
a
wore
of
white
paper
they
all
read
their
morning
papers
and
rarely
spoke
but
when
they
did
speak
to
each
other
they
used
an
almost
formal
respect
in
their
addresses
which
implied
that
they
were
all
respectable
people
with
responsibilities
and
houses
edwin
they
so
much
as
a
wilful
intrusion
as
an
unfortunate
accident
he
began
to
feel
ashamed
that
by
starting
from
the
terminus
he
had
occupied
a
corner
seat
to
which
the
gentleman
with
the
paper
cuffs
had
an
inalienable
right
in
a
little
while
the
villas
from
which
this
population
had
emerged
began
to
creep
closer
to
the
track
and
by
the
seventh
station
their
backs
were
crowding
close
to
the
embankment
with
long
narrow
gardens
in
which
the
crimson
rambler
rose
seemed
to
have
established
itself
like
a
weed
the
houses
too
or
rather
the
backs
of
them
grew
more
uniform
being
all
built
with
bricks
of
an
unhealthy
yellow
or
putty
colour
soon
there
were
no
more
buildings
the
endless
rows
seemed
to
be
suffering
some
process
of
squeezing
or
constriction
that
made
them
coalesce
and
edged
them
closer
and
closer
to
the
railway
line
soon
the
gardens
grew
so
small
that
there
was
no
room
in
them
for
green
things
only
for
a
patch
of
black
earth
occupied
by
lean
cats
and
posts
connected
by
untidy
pieces
of
rope
on
which
torn
laundry
was
hung
out
to
collect
the
smuts
or
flap
drearily
in
a
night
of
drizzle
then
the
gardens
went
altogether
and
the
beautiful
and
natural
love
of
green
things
showed
itself
in
sodden
full
of
languishing
geranium
cuttings
or
mignonette
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
to
have
been
subjected
to
the
increasing
squeeze
for
the
mild
air
of
the
downs
had
here
a
yellow
tinge
as
though
it
were
being
curdled
to
complete
the
process
the
train
plunged
at
last
into
a
sulphurous
tunnel
emerging
amid
acrid
fumes
in
a
sort
of
underground
vault
where
the
door
was
opened
by
a
with
a
red
tie
tired
already
who
shouted
none
of
the
respectable
suburban
gentlemen
took
any
notice
of
him
for
by
purchasing
season
tickets
they
had
rendered
themselves
immune
from
his
attentions
but
he
glared
at
edwin
and
edwin
passed
him
his
ticket
which
was
handed
on
as
if
it
were
a
curiosity
and
a
rather
vulgar
possession
by
the
gentlemen
on
his
side
of
the
compartment
the
door
was
slammed
the
man
with
the
placed
it
carefully
on
his
head
and
adjusted
the
paper
cuffs
others
folded
their
morning
papers
and
put
them
in
their
pockets
one
apparently
recognizing
a
friend
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
for
the
first
time
said
and
the
train
passed
amid
thunderous
echoes
under
the
arch
and
into
victoria
station
all
his
were
adepts
at
evacuation
and
before
he
knew
where
he
was
edwin
was
alone
in
the
carriage
he
was
very
lonely
and
yet
somehow
a
little
important
usually
at
term
end
he
had
crossed
london
with
widdup
whose
westward
train
also
started
from
paddington
he
hailed
a
hansom
and
one
that
was
worthy
of
its
name
a
shining
chariot
all
varnish
with
yellow
wheels
and
polished
brass
and
clean
straw
that
smelt
of
the
stable
on
its
floor
the
cabman
was
youngish
and
ready
to
be
facetious
he
called
edwin
lord
and
edwin
hardly
knew
whether
to
treat
him
seriously
or
not
to
the
races
my
lord
he
said
the
lord
knew
edwin
had
had
enough
of
races
for
a
bit
he
said
or
newbury
said
the
cabby
climbing
to
his
seat
it
was
a
great
moment
the
movement
was
all
so
swift
and
luxurious
the
hansom
so
delicately
sprung
that
it
swayed
gently
with
the
motion
the
polished
lamps
on
either
side
were
filled
with
wedding
rosettes
inside
on
either
hand
were
oblong
mirrors
in
which
edwin
could
almost
see
his
own
profile
a
subject
of
endless
curiosity
there
was
even
a
little
brass
receptacle
for
a
cunarder
of
a
cab
the
cabby
whistled
dolly
with
a
ravishing
tremolo
the
cab
which
had
jolted
a
trifle
on
the
setts
of
the
passed
among
a
flight
of
feeding
pigeons
out
of
the
iron
gates
into
the
bowling
smoothness
of
the
palace
road
my
word
this
was
life
perhaps
she
was
dead
already
oh
why
should
a
day
like
this
be
marred
it
seemed
to
him
after
a
thought
that
it
was
if
it
were
be
possessed
by
two
and
opposite
emotions
at
once
he
was
miserable
to
feel
an
alarm
which
exactly
definite
or
real
and
yet
he
could
not
help
enjoying
this
astounding
and
unforeseen
adventure
i
feel
like
that
he
thought
be
exactly
and
that
comforted
him
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
joys
of
the
morning
the
streets
were
so
wide
and
clean
the
green
fringe
of
the
park
so
pleasant
through
the
railings
he
could
see
men
and
women
on
horseback
taking
an
early
ride
enjoying
like
him
the
coolness
of
the
morning
air
he
wondered
at
the
great
white
stucco
houses
of
park
lane
standing
back
from
the
wide
pavement
with
an
air
of
pompous
reticence
before
one
of
them
remnant
of
a
summer
dance
the
night
before
a
tented
portico
striped
with
red
and
white
overstretched
the
pavement
edwin
did
not
know
what
kind
of
people
lived
in
these
houses
but
in
the
light
of
this
morning
it
seemed
to
him
that
theirs
must
be
an
existence
of
fabulous
happiness
all
clean
and
bright
and
shining
as
the
morning
itself
or
the
hansom
spinning
along
with
its
yellow
spokes
beside
the
neat
park
railings
all
of
them
were
surely
exalted
splendid
creatures
born
to
great
names
and
a
way
of
life
without
the
least
complication
dowered
with
a
kind
of
instinctive
physical
cleanliness
at
the
corner
by
marble
arch
the
hansom
cab
silent
but
for
its
jolly
jingling
bells
nearly
ran
over
an
old
gentleman
in
a
frock
coat
with
an
exquisite
white
stock
and
a
noble
nose
his
name
was
probably
cohen
but
edwin
thought
he
must
be
at
least
an
earl
once
again
the
resorts
of
elegance
were
left
behind
the
hansom
heaving
heavily
was
checked
on
the
slope
of
the
gradient
descending
to
the
departure
platform
at
paddington
opposite
the
it
stopped
and
edwin
was
released
from
this
paradisaical
loosebox
the
cabby
wishing
him
the
best
of
luck
at
goodwood
patted
his
horse
whom
he
had
christened
jeddah
and
climbed
up
again
to
his
seat
whistling
divinely
edwin
was
disgorged
upon
the
long
platform
at
paddington
that
rumbled
with
the
sound
of
many
moving
trollies
below
a
faint
hiss
of
escaping
steam
and
smelt
as
he
had
always
remembered
it
of
sulphur
mingled
with
axle
grease
and
the
peculiar
odour
that
hangs
about
tin
he
was
thankful
to
be
free
of
it
sitting
in
the
corner
of
a
carriage
opposite
a
stout
woman
with
eyes
that
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
all
night
and
a
heavy
black
veil
whose
hat
was
surmounted
by
coloured
photographs
of
the
memorial
theatre
at
stratford
and
brixham
trawlers
waiting
for
a
breeze
this
train
ran
out
of
london
more
easily
than
the
other
had
entered
it
the
area
of
painful
constriction
seemed
more
narrow
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
he
found
himself
gliding
along
the
thames
valley
with
the
ghostly
round
tower
of
windsor
castle
on
his
left
at
reading
where
the
sidings
of
the
biscuit
factory
reminded
him
of
teas
which
he
had
with
widdup
the
woman
opposite
took
out
a
crumpled
paper
bag
and
began
to
eat
sandwiches
she
lifted
her
veil
to
do
so
and
the
process
suddenly
proclaimed
her
human
edwin
saw
that
she
as
he
had
imagined
a
sombre
creature
but
a
woman
of
middle
age
with
a
comfortable
face
and
a
methodical
appetite
he
began
to
wonder
what
he
should
say
if
she
offered
him
a
sandwich
for
he
dreaded
the
idea
of
accepting
anything
from
a
stranger
and
at
the
same
time
could
not
deny
that
he
was
awfully
hungry
for
the
chocolate
creams
that
he
had
absorbed
at
the
downs
station
had
failed
to
dull
his
normal
appetite
this
emergency
however
never
arose
the
woman
in
black
worked
steadily
through
her
meal
and
when
she
had
finished
her
packet
of
sandwiches
folded
the
paper
bag
tidily
and
placed
it
in
a
wicker
travelling
basket
from
which
she
produced
one
of
those
bottles
in
which
spirits
are
sold
at
railways
stations
from
this
she
took
a
prolonged
and
delicious
gulp
recorked
and
replaced
it
smiled
to
herself
sighed
and
lowered
her
portcullis
once
more
it
cheered
edwin
to
think
that
she
as
inhuman
and
sinister
as
he
had
imagined
and
in
a
little
while
he
saw
beneath
her
veil
that
she
had
closed
her
eyes
and
was
gradually
falling
asleep
the
sun
meanwhile
was
climbing
towards
the
south
and
the
railway
carriage
began
to
reflect
the
summery
atmosphere
of
the
green
and
pleasant
land
through
which
the
train
was
passing
it
made
golden
the
dust
on
the
at
elbow
and
discovered
warm
colours
in
the
pile
of
the
russet
cloth
with
which
the
carriage
was
upholstered
it
was
a
country
of
green
woods
and
fields
of
ripening
from
which
the
sound
of
a
machine
could
sometimes
be
heard
above
the
rumble
of
the
train
it
all
seemed
extraordinarily
peaceful
a
cuckoo
passed
in
level
flight
from
one
of
the
hedgerow
elms
to
the
dark
edge
of
a
wood
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
itself
a
straight
green
clearing
appeared
it
reminded
edwin
of
the
green
roads
that
pierced
the
woods
below
uffdown
and
he
remembered
poignantly
the
walk
with
his
mother
in
the
easter
holidays
when
they
had
reached
the
crown
of
the
hills
at
sunset
some
day
they
had
said
they
would
make
that
journey
again
some
day
perhaps
never
was
it
quite
impossible
to
get
away
from
that
threatening
shadow
but
even
while
he
was
thinking
how
unreasonable
and
how
cruel
the
whole
business
was
another
sight
fell
upon
his
eyes
and
filled
him
with
a
new
and
strange
excitement
a
small
cluster
of
spires
set
in
a
city
of
pale
smoke
and
one
commanding
dome
he
held
his
breath
he
knew
that
it
was
oxford
this
then
was
the
city
of
his
dreams
here
in
a
little
while
he
would
find
himself
living
the
new
life
of
leisure
and
spaciousness
and
culture
which
had
become
his
chief
ambition
this
was
his
mecca
lovely
city
with
her
dreaming
spires
he
whispered
to
himself
it
was
indeed
merciful
that
the
vision
of
his
second
dream
should
come
to
cheer
him
when
the
first
became
so
perilously
near
extinction
even
when
the
train
began
to
slow
down
among
suburbs
of
an
appalling
ugliness
the
mood
of
excitement
had
not
faded
the
train
ran
in
smoothly
and
the
woman
in
black
awoke
and
blew
her
nose
edwin
looking
out
of
the
carriage
window
saw
a
congregation
of
demigods
in
grey
flannel
trousers
celestial
socks
and
tweed
norfolk
coats
lounging
with
a
grace
that
was
olympian
upon
the
platform
all
of
them
he
thought
were
supremely
happy
in
this
holy
city
happiness
had
her
dwelling
one
of
back
was
turned
to
him
of
layton
the
old
head
of
the
house
he
remembered
with
a
thrill
that
layton
who
had
won
a
scholarship
at
new
college
was
now
in
oxford
of
course
it
must
be
he
very
excited
edwin
slipped
out
of
the
carriage
and
ran
after
him
he
called
and
the
young
man
looked
round
do
you
want
he
said
it
layton
at
all
edwin
apologised
awfully
sorry
i
thought
you
were
a
chap
i
the
porters
were
slamming
the
doors
and
he
only
just
managed
to
scramble
into
his
seat
before
the
train
started
the
woman
in
black
spoke
for
the
first
time
she
had
a
soothing
voice
with
a
burr
that
reminded
him
of
his
father
and
widdup
thought
you
were
going
to
be
left
behind
she
said
saw
your
bag
was
labelled
north
shouts
were
heard
on
the
platform
bromwich
next
next
stop
north
bromwich
edwin
sat
down
panting
and
the
train
moved
off
stop
north
the
words
echoed
in
his
brain
and
chilled
him
he
want
to
look
back
to
see
the
last
of
oxford
next
stop
north
bromwich
at
north
bromwich
he
would
know
the
worst
swiftly
inevitably
the
train
was
carrying
him
towards
it
the
tragedy
had
to
be
faced
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
inconsolable
fear
of
desolation
his
eyes
brimmed
with
tears
so
that
the
coloured
landscape
could
not
be
seen
any
longer
the
tears
gathered
and
fell
he
could
feel
them
trickling
down
his
cheeks
and
when
he
knew
that
he
could
not
hold
them
back
any
longer
the
strain
of
his
emotion
was
too
strong
for
him
and
against
his
will
he
sobbed
aloud
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
the
woman
in
black
hearing
the
sobs
raised
her
veil
and
looked
at
him
is
it
my
dear
she
said
nothing
cry
about
nothing
she
spoke
quite
kindly
and
her
kindness
was
too
much
for
him
it
gave
him
quite
an
unaccountable
feeling
of
relief
to
speak
about
it
my
mother
he
said
is
it
really
bad
for
when
did
she
pass
away
dead
i
i
hope
she
but
awfully
cry
now
boy
while
life

always

black
woman

good
why

my
patients
of
what
sort
of
patients

monthly

edwin
did
not
understand

asked
many
of
them

a
matter
of
births
than
deaths

belief
that

a
young
boy

to
lose
his
best
his
my
belief
that
death
is
a
happy
release

happy
release
i
always
tell
them
that
especially
after
a
long
illness
i
wonder
has
your
dear
mother
been
ill
for
a
long
time
edwin
thought
said
the
black
woman
with
relish
you
could
give
me
some
idea
of
what
she
was
suffering
from
and
then
i
could
tell
you
near

edwin
was
think
of

that
a
bad
complaint

hopes

they

better
edwin
asked
in
agony
expect

do
sometimes
they
all
goes
to
sugar
said
the
woman
enigmatically
ought
to
know
for
had
them
yes

them
but
while
life
hope

i
always
say
and
a
best
friend

edwin
sobbing
once
more

cried
i

that
wicked
to
say
that
i
should
be
frightened
to
be
struck
dead
myself
if
i
said
a
thing
like
that
in
she
looked
nervously
at
the
luggage
rack
above
her
head
as
if
she
expected
to
find
the
almighty
in
hiding
there
edwin
followed
the
direction
of
her
glance
and
read
rack
is
provided
for
light
articles
only
it
must
not
be
used
for
heavy
he
wondered
inconsequently
whether
the
stop
which
was
missing
should
come
before
or
after
the
word
must
cheer
up
dearie
said
the
black
woman
soothingly
life
edwin
wished
she
would
shut
up
he
was
sorry
that
she
had
ever
spoken
and
yet
he
quite
suppress
a
desire
to
be
further
informed
on
certain
technical
details
which
this
authority
had
at
her
it
a
painful
death
he
asked
slowly
wiping
away
the
last
of
his
tears
well
not
to
say
painful
not
as
painful
as
some
most
of
mine
passed
away
in
their
sleep
like
and
they
look
so
peaceful
and
happy
a
great
consolation
to
their
friends
just
like
a
doll
they
look
better
you
cry
a
brave
boy
upon
my
word
even
though
used
to
it

upset
me

gave
a
little
laugh
and
dived
once
more
for
the
bottle

spirits

no
use

you
she
said
as
she
took
a
swig
edwin
shook
his
head

while
life
hope
while
life
hope
while
life
so
in
the
pitiful
whirl
of
brain
foolish
words
and
in
the
end
the
empty
phrase
seemed
to
attach
itself
to
the
regular
beat
of
the
rhythm
as
the
wheels
rolled
over
the
joints
in
the
rails
mesmerised
by
the
formula
he
only
dimly
realised
that
they
were
now
roaring
under
a
sky
far
paler
and
less
blue
towards
the
huge
pall
of
yellowish
atmosphere
beneath
which
the
black
country
sweltered
soon
the
prim
small
gardens
told
that
they
were
touching
the
tentacles
of
a
great
town
a
patch
of
desert
country
scarred
with
forgotten
workings
in
which
water
reflected
the
pale
sky
and
scattered
with
heaps
of
slag
a
pair
of
conical
blast
furnaces
standing
side
by
side
and
towering
above
the
black
factory
sheds
like
temples
of
some
savage
religion
as
indeed
they
were
gloomy
canal
wharfs
fronting
on
walls
where
leaky
steampipes
bound
with
asbestos
hissed
the
exhaust
of
a
single
small
engine
puffing
regular
jets
of
dazzling
white
steam
seen
but
not
heard
a
canal
barge
painted
in
garish
colours
swimming
in
yellow
water
foul
with
alkali
refuse
a
disused
factory
with
a
tall
chimney
on
which
the
words
harris
and
brass
founders
was
painted
in
vertical
letters
which
the
mesmeric
eye
must
read
another
mile
of
black
desert
pools
and
slag
heaps
and
ragged
children
flying
kites
everywhere
a
vast
debris
of
rusty
iron
old
wheels
corroded
boilers
tubes
writhen
and
tangled
as
if
they
had
been
struck
by
lightning
an
asphalt
on
a
slope
with
a
tall
gothic
school
and
children
screaming
their
lungs
out
but
silent
to
ears
endless
mean
streets
of
dusky
brick
houses
with
roofs
of
purple
slate
and
blue
brick
footpaths
dust
and
an
acrid
smell
as
of
smoking
pit
heaps
more
houses
and
above
them
misty
and
almost
beautiful
the
high
clock
tower
of
the
art
gallery
a
thunderous
the
clamour
of
the
wheels
swelled
to
an
uproar
life
hope
while
life
under
the
gloom
of
the
great
glass
roof
the
train
emerged
dearie
said
the
black

bad

chapter
ix
the
dark
house
i
aunt
laura
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
platform
it
was
a
very
strange
sensation
always
at
other
times
when
he
had
come
home
from
his
mother
had
met
him
at
north
bromwich
and
even
now
it
seemed
natural
to
look
for
her
to
pick
out
her
fragile
figure
from
all
the
others
on
the
platform
and
then
to
kiss
her
cool
face
through
her
veil
on
these
occasions
neither
of
them
would
speak
but
he
would
see
her
eyes
smiling
and
full
of
love
looking
him
all
over
drowning
him
in
their
particular
kindness
aunt
laura
was
a
poor
substitute
she
was
a
little
more
diffuse
and
emotional
than
usual
and
at
the
same
time
curiously
kinder
she
kissed
lips
were
he
felt
that
the
kiss
was
really
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
conceal
an
entirely
different
emotion
and
to
hide
her
eyes
on
his
cheek
her
lips
trembled
he
dared
not
look
at
her
for
he
was
afraid
that
in
her
eyes
he
would
be
able
to
read
the
worst
it
had
to
be
faced
at
last
he
managed
to
say
is
she
and
above
the
roar
of
the
station
he
heard
an
uncertain
voice
answer
very
ill
eddie
very
ill
dead
not
dead
no
we
must
all
be
brave
must
all
be
he
hated
to
hear
her
talk
like
that
what
had
she
to
be
brave
about
it
her
mother
who
was
dying
only
her
sister
a
sister
like
a
mother
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
these
conventional
things
he
believe
she
really
meant
them
she
could
cry
her
eyes
out
before
believe
her
however
kind
she
might
try
to
be
it
any
good
her
trying
to
be
kind
now
she
been
kind
to
his
mother
he
remembered
the
day
when
her
callousness
had
made
his
mother
cry
he
pity
her
now
he
put
up
with
her
condolences
he
believed
he
hated
her
he
would
hate
any
one
in
the
world
who
had
given
his
mother
a
pain
she
was
so
little
and
beautiful
and
and
yet
when
he
sat
opposite
to
aunt
laura
in
the
halesby
train
and
examined
her
more
closely
he
could
see
for
himself
that
the
strain
of
the
last
few
days
had
somehow
chastened
seemed
to
have
lost
some
of
her
florid
assurance
and
her
eyes
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
she
even
seemed
to
have
shrunk
a
little
and
this
made
matters
worse
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
very
thing
which
had
obliterated
what
he
most
disliked
in
her
had
also
accentuated
the
family
likeness
all
the
time
beneath
this
face
which
he
distrusted
he
could
see
a
faint
and
tantalising
resemblance
to
the
other
face
that
he
adored
if
any
one
had
suggested
to
him
that
aunt
laura
was
in
any
way
like
his
mother
he
would
have
denied
it
indignantly
but
the
likeness
was
there
a
curious
torturing
likeness
of
feature
he
know
then
what
in
after
years
he
was
to
realise
time
after
time
that
grief
has
a
way
of
suppressing
individual
characteristics
and
reducing
the
faces
of
a
whole
suffering
family
to
their
original
type
after
the
manner
of
a
composite
photograph
it
was
tantalising
and
so
harrowing
that
he
dared
not
look
at
her
any
longer
at
halesby
they
walked
up
from
the
station
together
almost
without
speaking
the
little
house
on
the
edge
of
the
country
wore
a
strangely
tragic
air
downstairs
all
was
quiet
after
the
big
echoing
rooms
at
it
seemed
ridiculously
small
nobody
inhabited
the
rooms
and
the
soft
carpet
created
a
curious
hushed
atmosphere
in
which
it
seemed
sacrilege
to
speak
in
anything
but
a
whisper
aunt
laura
took
off
her
hat
and
veil
better
carry
my
bag
upstairs
said
edwin
he
felt
somehow
that
in
his
little
old
room
he
could
be
happier
he
could
even
if
he
wanted
to
throw
himself
on
the
bed
and
give
way
to
the
tears
which
were
bound
to
come
better
wait
here
said
aunt
laura

with
jealousy

in
the
house
she
above
all
people
had
no
right

be
there
i
could
sleep

your
and
his
father
came
strangely
strangely
old
and
worn
he
looked
in
the
shabby
alpaca
coat
edwin
had
never
realised
that
he
could
be
so
pathetic
he
smiled
at
edwin
a
smile
that
was
unutterably
painful
my
boy
he
said
and
kissed
him
glad
she
was
anxious
for
you
to
come
father
must
all
be
brave
again
that
terrible
smile
may
i

aunt

aunt
laura

with
different

aunt

protested
if

ill
eddie
afraid
she
know
sure
she
would
you
worry
your
father
a
good
aunt
laura
then
fiercely
any
mother
father
sighed
and
looked
away
aunt
laura
with
a
change
of
tone
which
implied
that
question
was
disposed
of
whispered
to
his
father
she
still
sleeping
the
doctor
says
it
really
sleep
coma
a
gloomy
and
terrible
word
what
did
it
mean
edwin
remembered
the
woman
in
the
train
of
them
pass
away
in
their
sleep
think
go
and
lie
down
for
an
hour
said
his
father
do
john
said
aunt
laura
encouragingly
need
it
go
upstairs
myself
to
be
handy
if
the
nurse
wants
this
was
the
first
that
edwin
had
heard
of
a
nurse
the
idea
inspired
him
with
awe
his
father
sighed
and
turned
to
go
i
go
up
only
for
a
minute
aunt
laura
who
had
taken
upon
herself
the
role
of
protectress
and
manager
of
the
distressed
household
intervened
you
worry
your
father
all
in
trouble
and
you
be
a
his
father
went
without
speaking
when
can
i
see
her
edwin
demanded
you
must
be
patient
like
the
rest
of
us
now
i
must
go
upstairs
be
quiet
you
barrow
has
your
bedroom
ready
and
if
you
take
your
bag
over
give
you
some
tea
she
promised
to
look
after
you
she
was
most
kind
or
if
you
like
and
will
keep
very
quiet
you
can
stay
here
and
come
home
to
sit
down
here
and
read
why
did
they
send
for
me
to
come
if
they
let
me
see
her
i
want
her
said
aunt
laura
with
an
air
of
being
scandalised
she
left
him
closing
the
door
with
exaggerated
quietness
behind
her
leaving
him
alone
in
the
room
that
had
once
witnessed
so
much
happiness
he
know
what
to
do
read
the
idea
was
ridiculous
he
looked
at
the
familiar
shelves
on
which
he
knew
the
place
and
title
of
every
book
a
sense
of
the
awful
emptiness
oppressed
him
for
everything
in
it
recalled
the
memory
of
his
presence
the
books
that
they
had
read
together
the
big
chair
in
which
he
had
sat
cuddled
in
her
arms
her
workbasket
on
the
table
by
the
window
shopping
list
scribbled
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
he
bear
to
be
alone
in
the
room
with
so
many
inanimate
reminders
and
while
he
was
debating
where
he
should
go
a
sudden
angry
jealousy
flamed
up
in
his
heart
towards
the
other
people
in
the
house
his
father
aunt
laura
the
doctor
and
the
unknown
nurse
who
shared
the
privilege
that
was
denied
him
and
realise
its
value
he
clenched
his
hands
and
cried
aloud
belong
to
one
mine
i
hate
he
opened
the
door
softly
and
stepped
into
the
hall
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
looked
into
the
there
stood
the
piano
with
a
sonata
of
beethoven
upon
the
the
room
was
full
of
a
curious
penetrating
odour
which
came
he
discovered
from
a
big
vase
full
of
pinks
that
had
faded
and
gone
yellow
some
days
ago
he
supposed
his
mother
had
picked
them
her
hands
he
worshipped
her
hands
a
strange
and
uncontrollable
impulse
made
him
bend
and
kiss
the
dead
flowers
but
the
atmosphere
of
that
room
was
if
anything
more
cruel
than
the
other
he
stay
there
once
more
he
found
himself
in
the
darkness
and
quiet
of
the
hall
the
house
had
never
been
so
silent
only
in
the
corner
an
oak
clock
with
a
brass
face
engraved
with
the
name
of
carver
hay
ticked
steadily
in
the
silence
he
heard
his
own
heart
beating
far
faster
than
the
clock
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
climbed
upstairs
and
crept
quietly
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
his
mother
was
lying
he
knelt
on
the
mat
outside
the
door
and
listened
inside
the
room
there
was
no
sound
not
even
a
sound
of
breathing
if
only
he
dared
open
the
if
only
he
could
see
her
for
a
second
she
might
smile
at
him
and
he
would
be
satisfied
he
was
thankful
to
find
that
the
mere
fact
of
being
nearer
to
her
made
him
feel
more
happy
for
a
long
time
he
knelt
there
and
then
hearing
a
slight
noise
in
his
own
room
where
his
father
was
supposed
to
be
resting
he
stole
downstairs
again
a
little
comforted
opened
the
front
door
and
went
out
into
the
garden
ii
barrow
at
whose
house
it
had
been
arranged
that
edwin
should
put
up
for
the
night
was
the
nearest
neighbour
and
their
landlady
the
gardens
of
the
two
houses
stood
back
to
back
with
a
high
wall
between
and
the
relations
of
the
neighbours
had
always
been
so
friendly
that
the
little
door
in
the
wall
was
never
locked
even
though
it
was
so
seldom
used
that
tendrils
of
ivy
had
attached
themselves
to
the
woodwork
forming
a
kind
of
natural
hinge
on
the
side
of
the
wall
lay
a
modern
garden
not
more
than
twenty
years
old
mother
had
a
passion
for
flowers
and
his
father
had
made
the
gratification
of
her
pleasure
his
favourite
hobby
so
that
earliest
memories
of
both
of
them
were
associated
with
the
gathering
of
fruits
and
blooms
with
the
rich
odours
of
summer
or
above
all
the
smell
of
earth
this
summer
ingleby
had
planted
the
long
bed
that
stretched
along
the
side
of
the
house
towards
the
door
in
wall
with
masses
of
stocks
though
the
form
of
these
flowers
was
not
particularly
beautiful
their
scent
rose
to
meet
him
in
a
hot
wave
of
overpowering
sweetness
he
remembered
a
letter
in
which
his
mother
had
told
him
how
wonderful
they
were
everything
reminded
him
of
he
passed
through
the
door
in
the
wall
and
entered
another
world
everything
connected
with
barrow
was
in
character
she
was
a
little
old
woman
the
widow
of
a
small
manufacturer
who
had
set
his
mark
upon
the
countryside
by
the
erection
of
a
chimney
stack
taller
than
any
other
in
the
district
so
tall
that
even
from
the
summit
of
pen
beacon
it
made
a
landmark
more
prominent
than
the
slender
spire
of
halesby
church
in
eyes
its
presence
was
so
familiar
that
he
had
almost
become
fond
of
it
many
and
many
times
on
windy
days
he
had
watched
the
immense
structure
swaying
gently
as
a
reed
in
a
summer
breeze
under
the
shadow
of
monument
lay
an
old
garden
designed
on
the
formal
lines
of
a
hundred
years
ago
full
of
honeysuckle
arbours
and
narrow
twisted
paths
so
rich
and
so
tangled
that
every
year
a
great
part
of
its
fruitfulness
ran
to
waste
long
rows
of
lavender
were
there
and
alleys
of
hoary
whose
gnarled
branches
overreached
the
paths
and
the
whole
place
was
so
crowded
with
decaying
vegetable
matter
and
the
mould
of
fallen
leaves
that
even
in
high
summer
it
had
an
autumnal
savour
and
a
ripe
smell
that
was
not
unlike
that
of
an
apple
loft
through
this
shady
precinct
he
passed
carrying
his
pausing
only
in
a
sudden
patch
of
light
where
a
bank
of
tawny
scabious
diffused
an
aromatic
perfume
in
the
sun
he
paused
not
because
he
was
impressed
by
their
garish
beauty
but
because
many
of
the
heads
were
now
frequented
by
a
new
hatch
of
comma
butterflies
eagerly
expanding
their
serrated
wings
drugged
already
with
the
harsh
honey
edwin
had
never
seen
this
uncommon
butterfly
before
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
species
which
is
notoriously
capricious
had
never
appeared
he
wished
that
he
had
a
butterfly
net
with
him
for
by
catching
one
of
them
he
would
have
scored
over
widdup
so
he
passed
to
house
a
dark
georgian
structure
as
twisted
and
autumnal
as
her
garden
and
there
in
a
gloomy
he
found
the
old
lady
herself
a
little
demure
creature
with
shoulders
like
the
dormouse
in
in
taking
tea
with
her
companion
a
decorous
lady
of
the
same
age
named
miss
beecock
they
did
their
best
to
make
edwin
feel
at
home
they
never
mentioned
his
mother
but
it
was
so
obvious
that
their
maidenly
commonplaces
were
only
designed
to
divert
his
mind
from
the
tragic
shadow
which
he
carried
with
him
that
edwin
felt
inclined
to
scandalise
them
by
talking
of
their
deliberate
awkward
kindness
the
cautious
glances
which
they
exchanged
the
little
sniff
of
emotion
which
barrow
concealed
in
her
empty
teacup
when
the
pitiful
contemplation
of
youth
and
innocence
overcame
her
would
have
been
amusing
if
there
had
been
room
for
anything
amusing
on
the
darkened
earth
when
they
had
finished
the
buttered
scones
and
medlar
jelly
which
barrow
made
from
fruit
that
fell
on
the
dark
of
her
garden
barrow
herself
moved
with
short
steps
to
a
mahogany
bureau
and
calling
edwin
to
her
side
showed
him
one
of
those
secret
drawers
whose
secret
everybody
knows
smelling
of
cedar
wood
and
aged
russia
leather
from
this
drawer
she
produced
a
purse
made
of
beadwork
and
from
the
purse
her
fragile
fingers
extracted
a
georgian
piece
which
with
a
sigh
she
then
presented
to
edwin
i
were
you
she
said
think
i
should
spend
it
old
coins
like
that
are
valuable
barrow
had
a
great
interest
in
anything
old
and
edwin
was
so
surprised
by
this
generosity
that
he
almost
forgot
to
thank
her
but
miss
beecock
in
a
shrill
soft
voice
reminded
him
of
his
duty
saying
that
kind
of
barrow
edwin
edwin
hastily
agreed
that
it
was
and
the
old
ladies
smiled
at
one
another
as
though
they
were
saying
that
clever
of
us
to
give
him
a
toy
that
will
take
his
mind
off
his
mother
in
the
silence
that
followed
a
canary
which
had
been
pecking
at
a
lump
of
sugar
stuck
in
the
bars
of
his
cage
attracted
by
the
bright
hues
of
the
ribbon
on
cap
broke
into
a
shrill
twitter
swee
t
said
barrow
with
pursed
lips
sweet
echoed
miss
beecock
with
a
little
laugh
think
i
will
take
my
crochet
on
to
the
lawn
said
barrow
you
have
your
shawl
and
the
grass
is
not
too
damp
miss
beecock
reminded
her
was
a
heavy
dew
last
week
said
barrow
day
was
it
i
think
it
must
have
been
tuesday
yes
it
was
tuesday
that
was
the
day
on
which
i
spoke
to
waldron
about
thinning
the
grapes
and
now
edwin
would
you
like
to
fetch
a
book
from
the
you
may
prefer
to
bring
it
out
on
to
the
lawn
you
know
the
way
the
key
is
on
the
outside
of
the
edwin
said
he
left
them
and
climbed
the
creaking
oak
stairs
to
the
first
story
landing
a
wide
passage
of
polished
wood
lit
by
a
shining
fanlight
that
overlooked
the
street
he
knew
the
room
well
enough
it
had
been
one
of
the
delights
of
his
childhood
it
was
long
and
irregular
in
shape
and
crammed
with
curious
things
that
he
had
once
found
entertaining
he
unlocked
the
door
and
released
immediately
a
concentrated
odour
of
the
same
character
as
that
which
had
issued
from
the
secret
drawer
in
bureau
damp
and
cedar
wood
and
mouldy
russia
leather
all
the
chairs
in
the
room
were
covered
with
white
as
though
they
were
dead
and
awaiting
burial
the
venetian
blinds
were
down
and
when
edwin
raised
them
the
heavy
rep
curtains
at
the
side
of
the
three
tall
windows
admitted
no
more
than
an
ecclesiastical
twilight
there
however
stood
the
things
which
had
delighted
his
youth
nothing
had
been
moved
a
for
many
years
since
the
day
indeed
long
before
edwin
was
born
when
barrow
had
died
it
was
the
best
room
of
the
house
and
so
reverenced
by
barrow
that
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
living
in
it
or
using
it
at
all
except
on
christmas
day
when
a
melancholy
family
party
of
relatives
and
possible
heirs
assembled
to
do
their
duty
by
the
old
lady
then
and
only
then
a
fire
was
lighted
extracting
from
the
walls
a
curious
odour
of
dry
rot
which
resembled
curiously
enough
the
odour
which
pervaded
the
garden
edwin
was
soon
at
home
here
was
a
great
mahogany
bookcase
the
wonder
of
which
he
had
never
thoroughly
explored
here
was
the
flat
glass
showcase
shaped
like
a
in
which
a
number
of
curiosities
reposed
here
was
the
great
again
with
its
prickly
brass
cylinder
and
twanging
teeth
for
notes
and
a
winding
lever
that
made
a
sound
as
impressive
as
the
winding
of
a
clock
edwin
thought
he
would
try
a
tune
he
wound
up
the
mechanism
pressed
over
the
starting
lever
and
the
prickly
cylinder
began
slowly
to
revolve
it
made
a
bad
start
for
no
one
knows
how
many
years
ago
it
had
been
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
tune
then
having
finished
the
broken
cadence
it
burst
gaily
into
the
song
called
for
sale
a
pathetic
ballad
which
may
have
sounded
sprightly
in
the
ears
of
young
people
fifty
years
ago
but
in
this
strange
room
was
invested
with
a
pathetic
and
faded
quality
which
made
edwin
wish
it
would
stop
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
pull
back
the
lever
for
the
musical
box
as
though
guessing
his
wishes
suddenly
petered
out
with
a
sort
of
metallic
growl
edwin
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
at
this
peculiar
noise
and
hearing
the
echo
of
his
own
laugh
turned
to
find
himself
staring
into
the
jealous
eyes
of
a
portrait
of
a
victorian
gentleman
whom
he
took
to
be
the
late
barrow
for
whose
delectation
over
his
glass
of
punch
the
instrument
had
been
purchased
edwin
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
the
feeling
annoyed
him
silly
to
be
like
this
he
said
to
himself
suppose
the
oh
i
wish
i
knew
he
took
refuge
in
the
bookcase
from
which
he
extracted
to
his
great
delight
the
complete
works
of
shenstone
in
two
volumes
bound
in
slippery
calf
and
published
by
dodsley
in
the
year
the
books
were
in
a
beautiful
state
of
preservation
edwin
doubted
if
they
had
ever
been
read
barrow
no
doubt
had
purchased
them
simply
for
their
local
interest
with
a
final
glance
at
portrait
in
a
faint
hope
that
he
approved
of
his
choice
edwin
let
down
the
blinds
so
that
no
light
penetrated
the
room
but
a
single
gleam
reflected
from
the
glass
pane
of
a
that
hung
from
a
bracket
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
with
a
shiver
he
the
when
he
reached
the
garden
with
his
shenstone
the
light
was
failing
were
a
long
time
edwin
said
barrow
he
echoed
miss
beecock
afraid
it
is
time
barrow
was
going
quietly
and
with
a
leisure
that
seemed
to
presume
an
endless
placidity
of
existence
the
old
ladies
folded
their
work
sighed
and
recrossed
the
lawn
towards
the
house
in
a
little
time
came
supper
biscuits
and
milk
on
which
a
thick
cream
had
been
rising
all
day
then
barrow
kissed
him
he
felt
her
face
on
his
cheek
a
little
chilly
but
lax
and
very
soft
miss
beecock
lighted
him
to
bed
with
a
candle
in
a
brass
candlestick
the
sheets
were
cool
and
of
old
linen
the
bedroom
smelt
of
apples
with
the
air
of
for
in
his
head
and
a
sleepy
consciousness
of
ancient
creaking
timbers
edwin
fell
asleep
he
slept
long
and
dreamlessly
waking
in
the
morning
to
find
the
sun
shining
brilliantly
through
lace
curtains
at
first
he
could
not
remember
where
he
was
so
completely
had
sleep
bred
of
long
fatigue
obliterated
his
consciousness
before
he
opened
his
eyes
he
had
half
expected
to
hear
the
noise
of
widdup
turning
out
of
bed
with
a
flop
or
the
clangour
of
the
bell
and
then
with
a
rush
the
whole
situation
came
back
to
him
this
was
halesby
and
the
new
day
might
be
full
of
tragedy
at
his
bedside
miss
beecock
who
had
stolen
into
the
room
an
hour
or
so
before
in
slippered
feet
and
found
him
sleeping
had
placed
a
glass
of
creamy
milk
and
biscuits
it
was
awfully
kind
of
her
edwin
thought
as
he
sipped
the
yellow
cream
at
the
top
of
the
glass
outside
in
the
garden
it
was
very
quiet
he
had
overslept
the
morning
chorus
of
birdsong
but
he
heard
the
noise
of
a
thrush
cracking
on
the
gravel
path
beneath
his
window
he
had
forgotten
to
wind
up
his
watch
overnight
and
when
he
found
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
where
he
had
left
it
he
saw
that
it
had
stopped
better
get
up
anyway
he
thought
and
while
he
stood
at
the
door
wondering
if
house
ran
to
a
bathroom
he
heard
a
clock
in
the
hall
give
a
loud
whirr
and
then
strike
ten
lord
overslept
myself
he
thought
better
buck
abandoning
the
uncertainty
of
hunting
for
a
bath
he
dressed
and
came
downstairs
to
the
that
was
what
it
was
called
in
which
the
meals
had
been
served
the
day
before
barrow
was
sitting
there
in
pleasant
sunlight
wearing
a
less
elaborate
cap
and
a
shetland
shawl
and
the
canary
whose
brass
cage
and
saffron
plumage
now
shone
brilliantly
in
the
morning
sunlight
was
singing
like
mad
when
edwin
came
into
the
room
she
smiled
at
him
so
glad
that
you
slept
well
she
said
beecock
went
to
have
a
look
at
you
but
you
were
sleeping
so
soundly
that
she
like
to
disturb
you
you
must
have
been
tired
out
now
be
ready
for
at
this
point
miss
beecock
entered
the
room
her
attire
modified
in
the
same
degree
as
that
of
barrow
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
you
are
i
must
ask
annie
for
your
like
a
nice
brown
egg
lightly
boiled
and
some
buttered
toast
said
barrow
temptingly
of
course
he
would
said
miss
beecock
think
if
you
mind
said
edwin
like
to
go
home
so
you
mind
us
chimed
the
two
old
ladies
that
exactly
what
edwin
had
meant
but
he
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
and
even
enjoyed
his
breakfast
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
twitterings
of
the
canary
and
his
two
hostesses
sleep
here
again
you
they
said
when
he
was
ready
to
go
edwin
thanked
them
only
too
pleased
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
your
mother
they
said
pursuing
his
departure
with
the
kindest
and
most
innocent
of
smiles
this
time
he
did
not
linger
in
the
old
garden
he
was
far
too
anxious
to
get
home
and
learn
how
things
were
going
at
the
door
in
the
wall
his
heart
stood
still
what
was
he
going
to
find
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
terrible
might
be
waiting
for
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
it
was
a
silly
apprehension
he
thought
and
when
he
stepped
into
it
the
new
garden
was
as
sunny
as
the
old
only
on
the
long
walk
beside
the
bed
of
stocks
a
mattress
blankets
and
sheets
were
spread
out
to
air
in
the
sun
the
scent
of
some
disinfectant
mingled
with
that
of
the
flowers
his
fears
supplied
an
awful
explanation
it
was
the
bedding
from
his
room
that
was
spread
out
there
in
the
sun
and
when
he
looked
up
to
the
windows
of
the
house
above
him
he
saw
that
the
blinds
were
down
that
of
course
mean
anything
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
house
in
a
great
hurry
he
turned
the
corner
to
the
front
and
saw
that
the
blinds
on
that
side
were
down
as
well
iii
in
the
darkened
aunt
laura
sat
at
his
desk
writing
letters
with
dashing
fluency
when
he
came
in
she
stopped
her
writing
and
rose
to
meet
him
my
poor
dear
she
said
holding
out
her
hands
to
him
he
took
no
notice
of
her
hands
gone
he
said
the
night
in
the
night
she
passed
away
quite
quietly
a
dreadful
blow
for
us
edwin
we
must
be
brave
he
time
for
sentiments
of
that
kind
was
alive
when
i
came
yesterday
and
you
let
me
see
her
of
all
she
hated
you
she
told
me
so
she
always
hated
you
and
hate
you
for
this
more
than
she
cried
say
these
terrible
things
true
true
i
wish
it
were
you
who
were
dead
it
was
you
who
stopped
me
from
seeing
her
my
little
damn
you
damn
you
know
what
saying
i
like
that
cruel
talk
about
cruelty
aunt
laura
clutched
nervously
at
her
breast
it
was
funny
to
see
this
big
blowzy
woman
crumple
up
like
that
she
flopped
down
in
a
red
plush
chair
and
started
crying
softly
in
a
thin
voice
edwin
mind
let
her
cry
she
deserved
it
nothing
of
that
kind
could
soften
his
indignant
heart
father
he
asked
at
last
know
upstairs
somewhere
she
said
between
her
sobs
sake
edwin
go
and
say
things
like
this
to
the
poor
man
we
all
have
this
trouble
to
bear
and
had
the
strain
of
nursing
her
now
be
hasty
she
pleaded
right
said
edwin
and
left
her
upstairs
on
the
landing
he
found
a
pale
shadowy
figure
in
which
he
could
scarcely
recognise
his
father
neither
of
them
could
speak
at
all
edwin
had
been
ready
with
the
reproaches
that
had
come
to
his
lips
in
the
presence
of
aunt
laura
but
he
do
it
this
man
was
too
broken
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
grief
as
great
as
his
own
there
were
no
words
for
either
of
them
the
boy
and
the
man
clung
together
in
each
arms
overcome
with
pity
and
with
sorrow
on
the
landing
outside
the
door
of
the
room
where
she
lay
dead
they
stood
together
and
cried
quietly
to
each
other
and
now
it
seemed
to
edwin
as
if
pity
for
his
father
were
overriding
even
the
intensity
of
his
own
grief
for
she
had
been
everything
to
him
too
and
for
so
many
years
he
felt
that
he
would
have
done
anything
in
the
world
to
comfort
this
desolate
man
whom
he
had
always
taken
for
granted
and
never
really
loved
but
his
mother
had
loved
him
he
wondered
if
they
could
do
anything
to
assuage
the
bitterness
of
their
loss
by
loving
one
another
they
were
two
people
left
alone
with
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
each
other
why
not
that
he
thought
was
what
his
mother
would
have
wished
he
felt
his
tears
on
his
forehead
the
roughness
of
his
grey
beard
he
felt
the
body
quivering
with
sobs
and
the
arms
which
clutched
his
body
as
if
that
were
the
only
loved
thing
left
to
him
in
life
they
went
together
into
the
little
room
that
had
always
been
and
there
they
knelt
together
beside
the
bed
he
exactly
know
why
they
knelt
but
kneeling
there
at
his
side
with
his
arm
still
clasped
about
his
waist
he
supposed
that
his
father
was
praying
and
though
edwin
could
not
understand
what
good
prayer
could
do
it
seemed
to
him
a
simple
and
a
beautiful
thing
it
made
him
feel
that
he
loved
his
father
more
than
ever
he
wished
that
he
could
pray
himself
he
tried
to
pray
for
what
there
was
nothing
left
in
this
world
for
him
to
pray
for
at
last
his
father
rose
to
his
feet
in
the
dim
room
and
edwin
rose
with
him
he
spoke
and
the
tears
still
choked
his
voice
and
his
bearded
lip
trembled
he
said
shall
never
be
able
to
get
over
this
my
life
my
life
has
he
stopped
know
what
she
was
to
me
eddie
i
realise
eddie
there
are
only
two
of
us
left
we
must
help
each
other
to
bear
it
we
must
be
strange
that
a
phrase
which
had
sounded
like
cant
on
the
lips
of
aunt
laura
should
now
seem
the
truest
and
most
natural
thing
imaginable
we
were
like
children
together
said
his
father
again
they
stood
for
a
little
while
in
silence
at
last
edwin
still
gripping
his
arm
said
may
i
see
her
course
dear
they
went
together
to
the
room
and
his
father
opened
the
door
and
pulled
up
one
of
the
blinds
bagley
the
charwoman
who
did
odd
work
in
the
house
and
was
an
expert
in
this
melancholy
office
had
drawn
a
clean
white
sheet
over
the
bed
his
mother
lay
there
in
a
cotton
nightdress
with
her
hands
folded
in
front
of
her
and
her
lips
gently
smiling
even
her
cheeks
were
faintly
flushed
but
the
rest
of
her
face
and
her
hands
were
of
a
waxen
pallor
she
looked
very
small
and
childlike
she
looked
like
a
small
wax
doll
in
this
frail
and
strangely
beautiful
creature
edwin
could
only
recognise
a
shadow
of
the
mother
that
he
knew
it
was
a
little
girl
that
lay
there
not
his
mother
edwin
spoke
in
a
whisper
i
kiss
her
his
father
nodded
and
turned
away
but
he
did
not
kiss
her
as
he
had
thought
he
would
for
some
reason
he
dared
not
for
he
could
not
feel
certain
that
it
was
she
at
all
he
only
touched
her
hands
the
hands
that
he
had
always
worshipped
with
his
fingers
they
were
cold
and
still
her
lips
smiled
the
room
was
full
of
the
odour
of
sanitas
which
some
one
had
sprayed
or
sprinkled
over
the
floor
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
smell
was
one
which
edwin
hated
for
in
his
mind
it
became
the
smell
of
death
iv
on
the
evening
after
the
funeral
edwin
sat
alone
in
the
he
sat
there
because
the
other
room
was
still
cumbered
with
the
remnants
of
a
melancholy
repast
several
leaves
of
mahogany
had
been
dragged
down
from
the
dust
of
the
attic
and
had
lengthened
the
table
to
such
an
extent
that
there
was
scarcely
room
to
move
in
it
and
round
this
table
in
the
sunny
afternoon
had
clustered
a
large
collection
of
people
who
smelt
of
black
crape
and
spoke
in
lowered
gentle
voices
out
of
respect
for
the
woman
whom
it
seemed
to
edwin
they
had
never
known
everybody
who
entered
the
there
were
many
for
ingleby
was
much
respected
in
the
same
grave
air
even
the
undertaker
a
brisk
little
man
with
a
fiery
red
beard
and
one
shoulder
lower
than
the
other
from
the
constant
carrying
of
coffins
treated
his
daily
task
with
the
same
sort
of
mute
reverence
his
face
at
any
rate
wore
an
expression
that
matched
that
of
the
mourners
and
edwin
was
only
disillusioned
as
to
the
sincerity
of
his
expression
when
he
heard
him
swearing
violently
at
the
driver
of
the
first
mourning
carriage
this
moment
of
relaxation
caused
him
to
forget
himself
so
far
as
to
whistle
a
pantomime
song
as
he
crossed
the
drive
the
people
in
the
did
not
hear
him
they
were
far
too
busy
being
serious
and
behind
them
from
time
to
time
edwin
could
see
the
grey
face
of
his
father
with
curiously
tired
and
puzzled
eyes
puzzled
that
was
the
only
word
for
them
it
was
just
as
if
the
man
were
protesting
in
all
simplicity
against
the
unreason
and
injustice
of
the
blow
which
had
fallen
on
him
edwin
savagely
hating
the
presence
of
all
these
hushed
uninterested
people
found
in
his
suffering
face
a
sudden
reinforcement
to
his
anger
it
was
a
shame
a
damned
ghastly
shame
that
a
simple
man
like
that
should
be
hit
in
the
dark
and
even
more
pathetic
that
he
should
be
simple
enough
to
take
the
sympathy
of
his
neighbours
at
its
face
value
edwin
glowed
with
a
new
and
protective
love
for
his
father
it
was
as
well
that
some
generous
emotion
should
be
born
to
take
the
place
of
his
numb
grief
above
all
the
sight
of
his
aunt
laura
who
was
conscientiously
doing
the
honours
of
the
house
maddened
him
he
could
not
look
at
her
without
remembering
that
she
had
been
selfish
and
unkind
to
his
mother
that
on
the
very
last
day
she
had
robbed
him
of
the
privilege
of
seeing
his
darling
alive
even
now
he
believed
that
she
was
enjoying
herself
her
eyes
occasionally
brimmed
with
tears
but
that
meant
nothing
they
were
such
easy
tears
so
different
from
the
terrible
tears
that
had
shaken
his
body
on
the
day
of
desolation
if
only
she
were
dead
he
thought
there
would
be
no
great
loss
and
yet
while
he
thought
of
this
he
suddenly
caught
sight
of
her
husband
the
little
manufacturer
whom
he
had
lately
begun
to
know
as
uncle
albert
a
small
man
with
a
shiny
bald
head
and
a
diffident
manner
and
in
the
eyes
of
uncle
albert
which
were
fixed
upon
his
wife
he
saw
an
extraordinary
mixture
of
love
and
admiration
for
this
shallow
diffuse
creature
whom
he
had
found
himself
hating
aunt
laura
were
to
die
he
thought
albert
might
very
well
be
like
father
is
a
queer
idea
he
was
amazed
at
the
complications
of
human
relationships
and
the
potential
pain
that
love
brings
with
it
he
thought
no
good
thinking
about
i
give
it
up
i
really
wish
she
were
dead
i
only
wish
that
there
were
no
such
thing
as
death
why
does
god
allow
it
no
answer
came
to
him
but
in
place
of
an
answer
another
angry
impulse
god
he
thought
meaning
the
god
of
leeming
the
god
to
whom
this
queer
collection
of
people
were
to
dedicate
his
soul
another
thought
followed
quickly
the
good
of
cursing
him
he
exist
if
he
existed
this
sort
of
thing
happen
people
were
seriously
setting
themselves
to
the
putting
on
of
black
kid
gloves
that
the
undertaker
had
provided
the
horses
on
the
gravel
drive
were
getting
uneasy
and
the
cab
wheels
made
a
grating
noise
heavy
steps
were
heard
descending
the
steps
like
those
of
men
moving
furniture
edwin
saw
that
his
father
had
heard
too
he
was
looking
towards
the
closed
door
of
the
room
he
wanted
to
go
and
take
his
hand
and
hold
it
but
the
space
round
the
edge
of
the
table
was
packed
with
people
now
they
had
opened
the
hall
door
he
dared
not
look
out
of
the
window
the
voice
of
aunt
laura
most
studiously
kind
said
to
him
come
along
with
your
father
and
uncle
albert
and
he
said
people
at
the
side
of
the
table
made
way
for
him
on
his
way
he
found
himself
abreast
of
his
friend
miss
beecock
she
said
nothing
but
smiled
at
him
and
put
her
arm
on
his
sleeve
she
was
wearing
black
silk
mittens
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
that
weak
tearful
smile
nearly
did
for
edwin
the
first
cab
was
drawn
up
at
the
hall
door
edwin
scrambled
in
last
aunt
laura
with
a
rustle
of
black
silk
made
way
for
him
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
edwin
was
stifled
with
a
wave
of
scent
he
hated
scent
but
anyway
it
was
better
than
sanitas
he
saw
his
puzzled
eyes
on
the
other
side
of
the
cab
so
old
so
awfully
old
uncle
albert
took
out
his
handkerchief
too
evidently
edwin
thought
it
was
the
correct
thing
to
do
he
had
misjudged
him
uncle
albert
proceeded
to
blow
his
nose
they
were
driving
through
the
high
street
aunt
laura
noticed
that
most
of
the
shop
shutters
were
up
and
in
several
cases
tradesmen
were
standing
at
their
shop
doors
as
they
passed
very
kind
of
them
very
nice
to
see
so
much
respect
john
she
said
to
his
father
ingleby
said
and
aunt
laura
with
a
little
laugh
that
was
merely
a
symptom
of
nervousness
went
on
expect
be
a
crowd
at
the
cemetery
this
time
ingleby
said
nothing
and
uncle
albert
once
more
stolidly
blew
his
nose
dear
i
wish
you
said
aunt
laura
the
brakes
grated
and
the
cab
stopped
with
a
jerk
along
edwin
jump
out
a
good
boy
said
aunt
laura
walk
with
your
he
walked
with
his
father
the
church
was
full
his
father
went
with
bowed
head
seeing
nothing
but
edwin
was
conscious
of
many
faces
that
he
knew
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
the
thought
suddenly
came
to
him
that
these
people
really
there
to
do
honour
to
his
mother
they
were
so
many
that
most
of
them
could
never
have
known
her
no
they
were
just
curious
people
who
had
flocked
there
to
find
something
sensational
in
the
faces
of
the
mourners
in
a
dull
place
like
halesby
a
funeral
and
such
an
important
funeral
was
an
unusual
diversion
and
this
revelation
made
him
determined
that
whatever
happened
he
would
show
no
emotion
that
might
tickle
the
sensations
of
these
ghouls
he
only
wished
to
goodness
that
he
could
explain
the
matter
to
his
father
so
that
he
too
might
give
them
nothing
to
gloat
over
in
the
church
where
a
faint
mustiness
mingled
with
the
exotic
scent
of
arum
lilies
that
diffused
from
the
heap
of
wreaths
on
the
coffin
edwin
held
himself
upright
they
sang
a
hymn
heard
the
voice
of
jesus
say
come
unto
me
and
first
quatrain
in
unison
and
edwin
sang
with
them
just
as
he
would
have
sung
in
the
chapel
at
in
the
churchyard
when
they
walked
in
procession
behind
the
bearers
to
the
his
eyes
were
still
dry
his
lips
did
not
tremble
though
aunt
scented
handkerchief
was
now
drenched
with
tears
and
even
uncle
albert
a
virtual
outsider
was
on
the
edge
of
violent
emotion
the
burial
service
was
nothing
to
edwin
there
was
no
consolation
in
it
nor
to
him
the
least
atom
of
religious
feeling
a
mockery
a
mockery
a
solemn
and
pretentious
mockery
for
she
was
dead
she
had
vanished
altogether
and
the
thing
that
they
were
burying
with
muttered
formulas
and
tears
was
no
more
she
than
the
empty
parchment
of
the
cocoon
is
the
glowing
butterfly
let
them
cry
their
eyes
out
that
was
not
grief
beyond
tears
beyond
with
a
curious
air
of
relief
that
was
very
near
to
a
furtive
gaiety
the
party
drove
back
and
reassembled
in
the
all
except
ingleby
has
gone
to
his
room
poor
dear
said
aunt
laura
with
her
nervous
laugh
barrow
do
have
a
slice
of
just
a
little
round
the
long
table
conversation
began
to
flow
cautiously
at
first
but
with
an
increasing
confidence
when
it
became
clear
that
it
was
unattended
by
any
revengeful
consequences
you
think
it
was
awfully
nice
to
see
the
people
in
high
street
so
respectful
willis
said
aunt
laura
edwin
looked
up
this
then
was
the
willis
of
mawne
hall
with
whom
his
mother
had
planned
the
visit
to
switzerland
he
saw
a
woman
in
black
satin
with
a
gold
round
her
neck
and
jet
in
her
bonnet
she
caught
his
interested
eyes
and
in
return
smiled
aunt
laura
went
unanswered
wonder
edwin
thought
she
understands
what
a
fraud
the
whole
thing
at
any
rate
she
looked
kind
and
she
had
been
kind
to
his
mother
too
a
moment
later
she
said
and
when
aunt
laura
had
escorted
her
to
the
door
for
willis
was
a
person
of
consequence
the
rest
of
the
company
began
to
disappear
at
last
edwin
was
left
alone
in
the
room
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
aunt
face
that
had
been
glowing
with
hospitable
smiles
now
took
a
more
serious
cast
she
said
want
to
speak
to
you
said
edwin
go
very
painful
afraid
half
afraid
that
it
will
have
upset
your
father
poor
if
he
enough
to
put
up
on
earth
do
you
mean
can
you
ask
i
mean
your
behaviour
in
the
church
in
the
cemetery
you
stood
there
just
as
if
just
as
if
oh
it
was
most
irreverent
not
a
sign
of
grief
you
must
have
noticed
it
albert
uncle
albert
most
uncomfortable
at
his
inclusion
in
this
family
scene
but
fully
aware
of
the
disaster
which
would
follow
denial
said
yes
yes
one
must
have
noticed
it
aunt
laura
went
on
was
a
public
scandal
it
was
unnatural
it
showed
such
a
curious
lack
of
said
edwin
do
you
know
about
feeling
edwin
steady
from
uncle
albert
mother
were
here
he
said
could
hear
you
talking
this
damned
piffle
laugh
at
you
what
she
stick
your
sort
of
grief
at
any
the
very
day
of
her
burial
not
buried
it
she
you
buried
oh
sick
of
you
said
uncle
albert
who
felt
that
something
in
the
way
of
protection
was
demanded
of
him
now
i
mean
you
uncle
said
edwin
cruel
boy
aunt
laura
sobbed
he
left
them
there
he
carried
his
bitterness
into
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
it
was
very
quiet
there
through
the
bow
window
floated
the
perfume
of
the
bed
of
stocks
in
the
corner
stood
the
piano
he
had
often
listened
to
his
mother
playing
at
night
when
he
was
in
bed
he
loved
her
to
play
him
to
sleep
the
piano
was
shut
and
the
shut
piano
seemed
to
him
symbolical
all
the
music
and
all
the
beauty
that
had
been
there
had
gone
out
of
the
house
the
house
was
an
empty
shell
like
a
dry
chrysalis
like
a
coffin
there
on
the
hearthrug
where
he
had
crawled
as
a
child
he
lay
down
and
cried
chapter
x
threnody
i
from
this
emotional
maelstrom
the
current
of
life
flowed
into
a
strange
peace
it
seemed
that
the
catastrophe
of
death
had
taken
the
halesby
household
by
surprise
and
stunned
it
so
thoroughly
that
it
would
never
recover
its
normal
consciousness
father
who
had
now
returned
to
the
ordinary
round
of
business
was
still
dazed
and
puzzled
and
very
grey
their
servant
a
young
woman
with
an
exaggerated
sense
of
the
proprieties
or
perhaps
a
dread
of
living
alone
in
such
a
gloomy
house
had
given
notice
only
aunt
laura
to
shame
showed
the
least
capacity
for
dealing
with
the
situation
however
few
of
the
graces
may
have
fallen
to
her
lot
she
was
certainly
not
lacking
in
the
domestic
virtues
when
the
maid
departed
with
her
tin
trunk
and
many
tearful
protestations
of
her
devotion
to
the
memory
of
the
dear
mistress
aunt
laura
turned
up
her
sleeves
and
took
possession
of
the
kitchen
and
ingleby
who
had
gloomily
anticipated
a
domestic
wilderness
found
that
in
spite
of
the
defection
ambrosial
food
appeared
before
him
like
manna
from
heaven
the
only
difference
being
that
uncle
albert
who
could
not
be
permitted
for
one
moment
to
remain
a
bachelor
took
his
meals
with
the
family
the
relation
between
edwin
and
aunt
laura
was
still
difficult
she
could
not
he
could
not
bitter
things
that
had
been
said
on
that
most
mournful
day
though
her
native
good
humour
which
was
profuse
and
blustery
like
the
rest
of
her
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
injured
benignance
even
edwin
had
to
admit
that
she
was
a
good
cook
but
the
excellence
of
her
food
was
qualified
by
her
incessant
chatter
and
her
nervous
laugh
edwin
simply
stick
them
but
it
amazed
him
to
find
that
uncle
albert
evidently
found
them
cheerful
and
reassuring
indeed
it
was
possibly
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
being
a
man
who
resembled
her
in
nothing
and
whose
enthusiasms
could
never
get
him
beyond
a
couple
of
words
and
a
giggle
ingleby
too
seemed
to
emerge
without
serious
irritation
from
this
diurnal
bath
of
retiring
as
edwin
supposed
to
certain
gloomy
depths
of
his
own
consciousness
where
the
froth
and
bubble
of
aunt
conversation
became
imperceptible
even
when
she
spoke
to
him
most
of
her
observations
were
addressed
to
the
world
in
would
not
trouble
to
answer
her
a
slight
which
aunt
laura
took
quite
you
she
would
have
said
so
wrapped
up
in
himself
that
miles
away
from
anywhere
of
course
you
can
understand
it
in
a
man
of
his
age
especially
when
you
realise
how
devoted
he
was
to
poor
name
might
never
now
escape
the
commiserating
when
a
boy
like
edwin
tries
it
on
another
matter
altogether
simply
conceit
personally
i
think
it
was
a
great
mistake
of
his
poor
to
send
him
to
the
grammar
good
enough
for
the
willises
a
great
the
boy
is
getting
ideas
of
himself
that
warranted
by
his
position
i
know
what
we
are
to
do
with
him
we
certainly
have
him
running
wild
and
uncle
albert
would
say
certainly
my
love
in
spite
of
these
pronounced
opinions
aunt
laura
was
careful
not
to
cross
swords
with
edwin
himself
indeed
she
went
a
good
deal
out
of
her
way
to
propitiate
him
with
various
material
kindnesses
and
particularly
certain
delicacies
in
the
way
of
food
which
to
the
ruin
of
her
figure
in
later
life
represented
to
her
the
height
of
earthly
enjoyment
edwin
quite
know
how
to
take
these
attentions
he
help
disliking
her
and
the
fact
that
she
was
really
kind
to
him
rather
took
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
he
would
have
been
much
happier
if
they
had
been
allowed
to
remain
in
a
state
of
armed
neutrality
a
fortnight
passed
happily
for
edwin
in
spite
of
all
that
he
felt
he
ought
to
feel
he
missed
his
mother
awfully
that
was
true
enough
and
yet
and
yet
it
was
also
true
to
say
that
he
was
only
beginning
to
live
to
appreciate
the
joy
of
his
growing
strength
to
realise
the
enchanted
domains
that
were
open
to
his
eager
feet
and
to
his
eager
mind
here
he
had
freedom
leisure
health
so
much
of
the
world
to
see
so
much
of
human
knowledge
to
explore
and
though
the
thought
of
death
and
the
particular
disaster
that
had
befallen
him
fell
upon
his
spirit
sometimes
with
a
shadow
that
plunged
the
whole
world
into
desperate
darkness
he
could
not
deny
that
the
shadow
was
gradually
lifting
and
the
character
of
the
agony
that
had
desolated
him
was
becoming
less
spontaneous
till
in
the
end
it
became
almost
a
calculable
emotion
that
might
be
indulged
or
banished
at
will
he
found
it
difficult
to
understand
this
he
thought
a
brute
a
callous
insensitive
brute
what
would
she
think
of
me
and
yet
i
help
it
made
like
that
and
then
after
long
and
bitter
deliberation
believe
she
would
understand
i
expect
she
was
made
like
that
too
sure
she
was
and
if
one
thing
in
the
world
that
hate
it
would
be
that
i
should
force
myself
to
pretend
the
high
summer
weather
held
never
was
there
such
a
june
edwin
in
the
joy
of
perfect
health
would
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
when
the
dew
lay
on
the
roses
and
run
in
a
sweater
and
flannel
trousers
down
the
lane
and
over
the
field
to
the
where
he
and
his
mother
had
walked
so
often
in
the
evenings
of
spring
here
where
the
water
was
deepest
and
great
striped
perch
stole
slowly
under
the
he
would
strip
and
bathe
lying
on
his
back
in
the
water
so
that
low
sunbeams
came
dancing
over
the
surface
into
his
eyes
that
were
on
the
level
of
the
flat
leaves
and
their
yellow
balls
now
breaking
into
cups
afterwards
when
he
would
sit
glowing
on
the
bank
the
sun
would
be
rising
and
growing
warmer
every
minute
and
this
new
warmth
would
seem
to
accentuate
the
odour
of
the
place
that
was
compact
of
the
yellow
harsh
savour
the
odour
of
soaked
wood
and
another
more
subtly
blended
the
composite
smell
of
water
that
is
neither
fast
nor
stagnant
the
most
provocative
and
the
coolest
smell
on
earth
on
the
way
home
he
would
sometimes
get
a
whiff
of
the
cowhouse
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
from
within
there
came
a
sound
of
quiet
breathing
or
of
milk
hissing
in
a
pail
and
sometimes
from
the
garden
the
scent
of
a
weed
bonfire
would
drift
across
his
path
all
things
smelt
more
poignantly
at
this
early
hour
of
the
morning
all
things
smell
more
wonderfully
early
in
with
these
wonders
the
day
began
but
stranger
things
lay
in
store
for
him
he
revisited
all
his
old
haunts
the
tangled
woods
and
gardens
of
shenstone
on
the
the
ruins
of
the
cistercian
abbey
on
whose
fall
the
poet
had
moralised
the
little
chapel
that
marked
the
grave
of
the
murdered
mercian
prince
his
bicycle
took
him
farther
westward
always
westward
in
those
days
it
always
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
mountainous
country
that
his
mother
had
shown
him
that
evening
on
uffdown
rolling
away
into
remote
and
cloudy
splendours
must
be
the
land
of
his
desire
and
though
he
could
never
reach
it
in
a
day
he
managed
several
times
to
cross
the
severn
and
even
to
scale
the
foothills
upon
the
farther
bank
from
which
he
could
see
the
clee
hills
rising
in
a
magnificent
bareness
shaking
the
woods
and
pastures
from
their
knees
and
these
distant
hills
would
tempt
him
to
think
of
the
future
and
other
desires
of
his
heart
in
the
near
distance
oxford
where
layton
and
other
demigods
in
grey
flannel
trousers
abode
and
beyond
the
fine
untravelled
world
rivers
and
seas
and
forests
desolate
wonderful
names
china
africa
day
he
said
to
himself
will
go
to
africa
in
this
way
he
began
to
think
of
his
present
adventures
as
a
kind
of
prelude
to
others
remoter
and
more
vast
one
day
he
had
ridden
farther
away
than
usual
and
having
taken
his
lunch
at
the
bridge
town
of
bewdley
he
pushed
his
bicycle
up
the
immense
hill
that
overshadows
the
town
along
the
road
to
tenbury
for
all
its
steepness
this
mountain
road
was
strangely
exhilarating
the
air
that
moved
above
it
grew
so
clean
and
clear
below
him
between
the
road
and
the
river
lay
the
mighty
remnants
of
the
forest
of
wyre
his
way
tumbled
again
to
a
green
valley
where
no
mountains
were
to
be
seen
and
while
edwin
was
deciding
to
turn
off
down
the
first
descending
lane
and
explore
the
forest
he
heard
a
sound
of
spades
and
pickaxes
and
came
upon
a
group
of
navvies
several
of
them
stripped
to
the
waist
in
the
sun
working
at
a
cutting
of
red
earth
that
was
already
deep
on
either
side
of
the
road
for
the
most
part
they
worked
in
silence
but
one
of
them
a
little
man
with
a
stiff
soldierly
back
encouraged
them
with
a
string
of
jokes
they
called
him
and
the
elaboration
with
which
his
chest
had
been
tattooed
with
nautical
symbols
led
edwin
to
suppose
that
he
was
a
sailor
when
he
saw
edwin
leaning
on
his
bicycle
and
watching
the
work
he
called
out
to
him
asking
if
he
wanted
a
job
edwin
shook
his
head
reckon
said
the
gunner
a
job
would
be
more
in
your
line
gaffer
a
fine
sight
to
see
other
people
working
the
harder
the
the
men
laughed
and
stretched
their
backs
leaning
on
their
spades
and
edwin
could
see
how
a
fine
dew
of
sweat
had
broken
out
under
the
hair
on
their
chests
it
seemed
to
him
a
noble
sight
are
you
working
at
he
asked
it
a
railway
hell
with
your
railway
said
the
gunner
would
make
a
railway
heading
for
the
river
severn
no
a
this
the
welsh
water
is
it
going
to
where
does
it
come
from
from
the
dulas
valley
where
rebuilding
the
reservoir
under
a
hill
they
call
savaddan
and
a
black
job
it
is
i
can
tell
it
anywhere
near
a
place
called
felindre
i
think
it
must
my
son
the
goes
through
felindre
sixty
or
eighty
mile
from
people
come
from
felindre
god
pity
all
i
can
say
been
in
that
place
on
a
christmas
day
and
not
a
pint
of
beer
ah
a
black
job
well
mates
come
on
again
the
men
who
had
been
listening
lifted
their
picks
and
spades
and
the
busy
clinking
sounds
of
digging
began
again
edwin
wished
the
gunner
and
began
to
push
his
bicycle
up
the
hill
again
sixty
or
eighty
that
so
very
far
six
or
eight
perhaps
some
day
he
could
go
there
he
half
persuaded
himself
with
a
sentimental
argument
that
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
be
happy
in
the
country
from
which
his
people
had
come
that
even
the
borderland
of
it
must
be
possessed
by
the
same
curiously
friendly
atmosphere
always
most
happy
west
of
severn
he
thought
and
then
he
began
to
wonder
about
the
sailor
whom
the
men
called
gunner
perhaps
that
man
had
actually
been
in
he
managed
to
get
a
sixpenny
tea
at
a
little
general
shop
on
the
very
crown
of
the
hills
where
a
small
hamlet
named
far
forest
stood
the
romantic
name
of
the
place
appealed
to
him
and
it
was
a
curious
adventure
to
sit
down
alone
to
tea
in
a
back
room
that
smelt
of
candles
and
paraffin
and
bacon
at
the
shop
door
a
serious
old
man
with
a
white
beard
had
received
him
but
the
tea
was
brought
to
him
by
a
little
girl
in
an
extremely
clean
pinafore
whom
the
old
man
addressed
as
eva
she
was
a
curious
mixture
of
shyness
and
friendliness
and
her
serious
eyes
examined
edwin
minutely
from
under
straight
dark
eyebrows
when
she
came
in
with
the
tea
she
found
edwin
examining
some
books
that
stood
in
a
cupboard
with
a
glass
door
evidently
she
was
very
proud
of
them
are
my
brother
prizes
she
said
and
went
on
to
explain
how
clever
he
was
and
what
a
scholar
until
the
old
man
called
and
she
returned
to
him
in
the
shop
it
was
all
amazingly
peaceful
with
the
westering
sun
flooding
the
doorway
where
the
old
man
had
been
sitting
out
in
a
chair
when
edwin
arrived
and
opposite
the
door
was
a
little
patch
of
green
strewn
with
mossy
boulders
a
kind
of
platform
in
front
of
which
the
huge
panorama
of
clee
and
all
the
radnor
hills
expanded
a
place
like
this
edwin
thought
never
it
was
a
ripping
placid
sort
of
existence
in
which
nothing
ever
happened
but
all
things
were
just
simple
and
serious
and
tender
like
the
eyes
of
the
little
girl
named
eva
who
had
brought
him
his
tea
sir
said
the
old
man
at
the
door
it
was
rather
nice
to
be
called
coasting
down
the
hill
into
bewdley
edwin
had
all
the
joy
of
the
state
that
he
called
it
was
exhilarating
and
splendid
and
at
the
end
of
it
came
the
misty
river
town
with
its
stone
bridge
and
the
great
river
of
the
marches
swirling
proudly
to
the
south
when
he
neared
home
divinely
tired
and
hungry
the
stretched
before
him
in
a
galaxy
of
starry
lights
as
he
crossed
the
brow
of
the
hill
above
halesby
the
mawne
furnaces
suddenly
lit
the
sky
with
a
great
flower
of
fire
ii
at
home
auntie
laura
was
in
possession
evidently
she
was
primed
with
serious
business
for
edwin
could
see
that
his
father
sat
spiritually
if
not
physically
pinioned
in
the
plush
aunt
laura
wore
an
air
of
overpowering
satisfaction
evidently
she
had
already
triumphed
and
she
smiled
so
cheerfully
at
edwin
that
he
felt
convinced
that
she
had
scored
him
off
in
some
way
on
the
side
of
the
fire
opposite
to
his
father
uncle
albert
sat
smoking
not
as
if
he
enjoyed
it
but
because
it
gave
him
the
excuse
of
an
occupation
into
which
he
might
relapse
in
moments
of
tension
here
he
is
at
last
said
aunt
laura
been
talking
about
you
edwin
had
guessed
as
much
what
is
it
he
said
and
his
tone
implied
that
he
was
certain
that
some
dark
scheme
had
been
launched
against
his
peace
of
mind
uncle
albert
puffed
uncomfortably
at
his
pipe
and
nicotine
or
saliva
made
a
gurgling
noise
in
it
ingleby
sighed
aunt
laura
tumbling
to
the
hostility
of
the
new
atmosphere
hastened
to
propitiate
expect
hungry
edwin
she
not
hungry
thanks
what
is
it
be
cross
decided
so
it
was
all
decided
that
your
father
must
go
away
for
a
rest
a
little
holiday
and
that
means
of
course
that
we
shall
have
to
shut
up
the
house
until
he
returns
and
of
course
that
will
be
quite
easy
because
time
you
were
getting
back
to
we
thought
you
had
better
go
on
it
was
now
saturday
monday
it
is
fortunate
that
your
uncle
has
to
go
into
north
bromwich
on
business
that
yes
business
put
in
uncle
albert
as
though
he
were
anxious
to
explain
that
his
visit
to
that
sink
of
iniquity
was
in
no
way
connected
with
pleasure
edwin
burned
with
sudden
and
quite
unreasonable
indignation
you
agreed
to
this
father
of
course
i
agreed
your
aunt
is
quite
right
i
am
overtired
it
was
a
terrible
strain
and
the
doctor
suggested
that
my
native
air
i
mean
that
said
edwin
mean
about
i
go
back
now
of
course
i
be
ridiculous
and
childish
edwin
said
aunt
laura
severely
imagine
just
a
hushed
and
melancholy
has
happened
never
going
to
school
again
i
mean
that
of
course
i
only
only
the
term
is
nearly
over
in
another
fortnight
all
the
chaps
will
be
going
away
for
the
hols
it
worth
it
i
should
feel
considering
your
feelings
so
much
as
your
good
said
aunt
laura
complacently
father
you
mean
it
you
i
know
it
would
all
be
so
strange
so
awfully
difficult
i
should
have
lost
touch
with
all
the
work
the
form
was
doing
i
be
able
to
pick
it
up
rotten
rotten
you
will
distress
your
father
aunt
laura
do
let
father
speak
for
immense
volumes
of
yellow
smoke
signalled
uncle
distress
difficult
edwin
it
difficult
father
dear
aunt
laura
realise
she
realise
what
it
would
be
like
going
back
like
that
to
it
would
only
be
waste
of
time
father
read
during
the
i
would
really
it
that
i
want
to
get
out
of
going
back
to
work
it
that
a
bit
work
like
blazes
only
only
everything
now
seems
to
have
gone
funny
and
empty
sort
of
blank
i
i
feel
awful
without
mother
warningly
from
aunt
laura
that
aunt
laura
should
presume
to
correct
him
in
a
matter
of
delicacy
course
you
understand
he
said
bitterly
want
me
to
speak
about
mother
had
your
excitement
out
of
it
had
your
chance
of
bossing
round
and
now
you
want
to
arrange
what
i
shall
do
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
suppose
no
no
he
was
really
very
angry
it
was
always
difficult
for
him
to
be
anything
else
with
aunt
laura
for
he
felt
that
it
was
somehow
horribly
unjust
for
her
to
be
alive
when
his
mother
was
dead
and
he
could
never
never
forget
what
his
darling
had
told
him
of
her
stupid
jealousy
on
this
occasion
aunt
laura
seemed
to
be
less
disturbed
than
usual
by
his
violence
she
spoke
with
a
calculated
coolness
that
compelled
the
admiration
of
her
husband
sitting
very
uncomfortably
on
the
edge
of
the
storm
desperately
anxious
to
show
that
without
his
taking
sides
his
wife
could
rely
on
his
support
funny
edwin
said
aunt
laura
stroking
her
black
skirt
you
should
use
the
word
it
reminds
me
of
something
that
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
you
realise
you
that
we
are
all
supposed
to
be
in
mourning
and
yet
day
after
day
i
see
you
going
down
the
town
in
a
pair
of
white
canvas
gym
shoes
now
you
talk
to
me
about
reverence
edwin
burst
out
laughing
it
was
no
good
arguing
with
the
woman
he
gave
a
despairing
glance
at
his
father
was
it
possible
that
the
man
could
listen
seriously
to
superficial
cant
of
this
kind
was
it
possible
that
he
could
tolerate
the
presence
in
the
house
he
looked
and
he
saw
nothing
but
tiredness
and
desolation
in
the
face
he
saw
that
in
reality
his
father
was
too
tired
for
anything
but
compromise
all
life
all
determination
had
been
stamped
out
of
him
and
though
edwin
clutched
at
the
sympathy
which
he
knew
must
be
concealed
in
the
mind
he
began
to
realise
that
after
all
circumstances
had
left
the
whole
household
curiously
dependent
on
aunt
laura
that
without
her
the
whole
domestic
machine
would
collapse
and
that
therefore
the
infliction
must
be
suffered
patiently
edwin
determined
to
leave
the
matter
where
it
stood
but
aunt
laura
inflamed
with
approaching
triumph
would
not
let
it
rest
am
sure
that
you
agree
with
me
john
she
threw
out
challengingly
doubt
edwin
did
not
understand
you
know
more
about
the
people
in
the
town
than
we
do
thought
edwin
i
suppose
it
be
at
any
rate
nothing
that
he
might
do
should
give
the
man
a
discomfort
he
possessed
himself
in
silence
i
think
perhaps
ingleby
went
on
edwin
is
right
it
would
be
hardly
worth
while
going
back
to
for
a
course
you
know
best
john
aunt
laura
hurried
to
assure
him
really
quite
impossible
for
us
to
put
him
up
while
the
house
is
closed
and
you
are
away
you
know
that
arranged
to
have
the
painters
on
a
matter
of
fact
and
one
outside
controversy
uncle
albert
felt
that
he
was
safe
in
giving
his
support
quite
understand
that
said
ingleby
a
simple
matter
edwin
can
come
with
father
how
wonderful
of
course
said
aunt
laura
he
be
a
nuisance
to
you
but
edwin
was
too
pleased
and
excited
to
mind
what
she
said
he
kissed
his
father
and
ingleby
with
a
curious
tenderness
clasped
his
arm
it
seemed
that
catastrophe
had
strange
uses
already
it
had
thrown
the
ordinary
course
of
life
into
more
than
one
curious
byway
and
now
behold
he
was
to
embark
upon
another
strange
adventure
to
become
familiar
with
another
sort
of
life
he
determined
that
his
duty
whatever
that
might
be
should
not
suffer
by
it
when
they
returned
from
their
holiday
all
through
the
summer
months
he
would
work
like
anything
he
would
make
that
balliol
scholarship
that
had
seemed
part
of
an
indefinite
future
as
near
a
certainty
as
made
no
matter
he
would
show
other
words
aunt
laura
and
uncle
he
could
do
we
are
going
on
monday
i
had
better
think
of
packing
he
said
i
need
to
take
many
things
father
worry
your
father
edwin
said
aunt
laura
iii
sunday
came
with
its
usual
toll
of
dreariness
the
customary
penance
of
the
morning
service
was
actually
the
least
trying
part
of
it
to
edwin
to
begin
with
the
parish
church
of
halesby
was
a
structure
of
great
beauty
originally
an
offshoot
of
the
abbey
that
now
stood
in
ruins
above
the
long
string
of
slowly
silting
fishponds
on
the
stour
the
grace
and
ingenuity
of
successive
ages
of
priestly
architects
had
embellished
its
original
design
with
many
beautiful
features
and
the
slender
beauty
of
its
spire
crowning
a
steep
bank
above
the
degraded
river
had
imposed
an
atmosphere
of
dignity
and
rest
upon
the
rather
squalid
surroundings
of
this
last
of
the
towns
the
music
even
though
it
was
not
in
any
way
comparable
with
that
of
was
good
and
the
recent
arrival
of
a
young
and
distinguished
rector
from
cambridge
whose
voice
and
person
would
have
qualified
him
for
success
as
a
bishop
or
an
actor
manager
had
restored
to
the
building
some
of
its
popularity
as
a
place
of
resort
or
of
escape
from
the
shuttered
sunday
streets
at
ten
the
fine
peal
of
bells
filled
the
air
with
an
inspiriting
music
edwin
remembered
hearing
them
the
melancholy
with
which
they
had
often
inspired
him
on
dank
evenings
of
autumn
when
the
ringers
were
at
practice
very
different
they
sounded
on
this
summer
morning
for
a
gentle
wind
was
moving
from
the
hills
to
westward
and
chime
eddied
in
a
soft
air
that
was
clearer
than
the
usual
if
only
because
it
was
sunday
and
the
smoke
of
a
thousand
furnaces
and
chimney
stacks
no
longer
filled
it
with
suffocation
at
precisely
aunt
laura
appeared
in
the
in
a
black
silk
dress
smelling
faintly
of
lavender
a
minute
later
uncle
albert
in
a
frock
coat
coaxing
the
last
sweetness
from
his
pipe
ingleby
also
had
exchanged
the
alpaca
jacket
in
which
he
had
been
leisurely
examining
his
roses
for
the
same
uniform
uncle
albert
edwin
noticed
had
not
yet
removed
the
deep
band
of
crape
from
his
as
usual
aunt
laura
appeared
a
little
flustered
the
strain
of
conscious
magnificence
in
her
millinery
making
it
difficult
for
her
to
collect
her
thoughts
you
sure
you
have
all
the
albert
she
asked
anxiously
uncle
albert
regretfully
knocked
out
his
pipe
my
dear
he
said
scatter
those
ashes
all
over
the
fireplace
albert
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
keep
the
room
tidy
on
my
have
you
got
your
why
boy
actually
put
on
a
grey
striped
tie
run
and
change
it
quickly
i
know
what
people
will
edwin
smarting
obeyed
when
he
returned
the
atmosphere
of
impatience
had
increased
aunt
laura
was
saying
dear
are
you
sure
that
the
clock
is
right
afraid
the
bells
have
stopped
no
thank
goodness
there
they
are
again
better
edwin
now
we
really
must
start
you
have
the
money
for
the
collection
albert
give
it
to
me
or
be
sure
to
leave
me
without
any
i
do
hope
we
be
late
we
should
look
so
prominent
why
should
they
look
so
prominent
the
question
puzzled
edwin
all
the
way
down
through
the
quiet
streets
but
even
though
this
mystery
exercised
his
mind
he
could
not
help
appreciating
the
curious
atmosphere
of
the
route
through
which
they
progressed
at
the
corner
of
the
street
the
first
familiar
thing
smote
him
it
was
the
odour
of
stale
spirits
and
beer
that
issued
from
between
the
closed
doors
of
the
head
behind
which
it
had
been
secreted
ever
since
an
uproarious
closing
time
the
night
before
then
came
the
steep
high
street
and
from
its
gutters
the
indescribable
smell
of
vegetable
refuse
left
there
overnight
from
the
stalls
on
an
ordinary
morning
it
would
not
have
been
noticed
for
the
motion
of
wheeled
traffic
in
the
highway
and
the
sight
of
open
shop
windows
would
have
distracted
the
attention
on
sunday
morning
however
it
became
the
most
important
thing
in
the
road
and
seemed
to
emphasise
the
deadness
of
the
day
in
contrast
to
the
activities
and
dissipations
of
saturday
night
it
called
attention
to
the
indubitable
sordidness
of
the
whole
street
the
poverty
of
its
grimy
brick
the
faded
lettering
above
the
shop
windows
the
paint
that
cracked
and
peeled
from
the
closed
shutters
on
this
morning
halesby
was
a
squalid
and
degraded
town
even
shop
in
the
high
street
looked
curiously
small
and
mean
edwin
disliked
the
sight
of
his
own
name
printed
over
it
it
reminded
him
of
social
prejudices
they
entered
a
small
door
in
the
transept
when
the
last
bell
was
tolling
and
as
they
stepped
into
the
full
church
edwin
realised
at
last
the
reason
of
aunt
particular
anxieties
they
were
on
show
this
was
the
first
occasion
since
the
funeral
that
the
family
had
entered
the
church
and
in
accordance
with
an
immemorial
custom
the
congregation
were
now
engaged
in
searching
their
faces
and
their
clothing
for
evidences
of
the
grief
that
was
proper
to
their
condition
kneeling
in
the
conventional
opening
prayer
edwin
could
see
through
his
folded
fingers
that
the
whole
of
the
gathering
was
engaged
in
a
ghoulish
scrutiny
of
their
party
now
for
the
first
time
he
realised
the
full
meaning
of
the
horror
with
which
his
grey
tie
had
inspired
aunt
laura
he
could
even
feel
aunt
laura
who
remained
kneeling
longer
than
usual
wallowing
in
the
emotion
that
her
presence
evoked
it
was
a
rotten
business
if
he
could
have
dared
to
do
so
without
causing
an
immense
scandal
edwin
would
have
got
up
and
left
the
church
he
saw
aunt
laura
glance
at
his
father
with
a
kind
of
proprietary
air
as
if
this
exhibition
were
really
her
own
responsibility
and
the
degree
of
interest
that
appearance
aroused
were
to
her
credit
edwin
also
looked
at
his
father
he
wondered
if
ingleby
were
in
the
least
conscious
of
the
spectacle
to
which
he
was
contributing
decided
that
he
he
was
thankful
for
that
it
became
apparent
to
him
that
if
the
truth
were
known
his
father
was
a
creature
of
the
most
astonishing
simplicity
a
simplicity
that
was
almost
pathetic
he
could
see
he
knew
that
the
whole
church
must
see
that
the
man
had
suffered
the
he
was
awfully
sorry
for
his
father
and
he
loved
him
for
it
the
whole
affair
was
shameful
and
degrading
never
mind
in
another
hours
they
would
be
clear
of
all
this
sort
of
thing
it
was
something
to
be
thankful
for
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
his
wickedness
and
doeth
that
which
is
lawful
and
the
rector
began
to
intone
he
spoke
the
words
as
though
his
whole
soul
were
behind
them
his
voice
vibrated
with
a
practiced
earnestness
and
all
the
time
edwin
could
see
his
dark
eyes
scrutinising
the
congregation
in
detail
congratulating
himself
on
the
presence
of
his
supporters
speculating
on
the
absence
of
certain
others
in
the
final
cadence
of
the
sentence
a
masterly
modulation
that
would
have
made
you
swear
that
his
whole
life
was
in
his
mission
his
eyes
swivelled
into
the
corner
where
the
ingleby
party
were
sitting
and
edwin
could
have
bet
his
life
that
they
lighted
up
with
a
kind
of
satisfaction
at
the
addition
of
this
undoubted
attraction
to
his
entertainment
it
even
seemed
to
him
that
the
glances
almost
imperceptibly
indicated
to
his
wife
a
little
woman
of
a
pathetic
earnestness
qualified
for
the
ultimate
bishopric
by
a
complete
subjection
to
her
personality
the
fact
that
the
inglebys
were
on
view
the
rector
who
had
views
on
the
advantages
of
scamping
the
drier
portions
of
the
church
service
and
stressing
any
sentence
that
held
possibilities
of
fruity
sentiment
soon
got
into
his
stride
he
was
in
excellent
voice
that
morning
and
on
two
occasions
in
the
first
lesson
availed
himself
of
an
opportunity
of
exploiting
the
emotional
was
very
nearly
a
had
done
so
much
to
establish
his
reputation
in
his
early
days
at
halesby
he
was
making
hay
while
the
sun
shone
for
in
the
confirmation
service
such
opportunities
are
more
limited
edwin
enjoyed
the
psalms
there
was
even
something
familiar
and
pleasant
in
the
tunes
of
the
cathedral
psalter
after
the
exotic
harmonies
of
he
sang
the
tenor
part
when
last
he
remembered
singing
them
it
had
been
alto
and
lost
his
sense
of
his
surroundings
in
the
beauty
of
the
words
in
the
middle
of
them
however
he
became
conscious
of
his
father
singing
too
he
had
never
sat
next
to
his
father
in
church
before
his
mother
had
always
separated
them
and
for
this
reason
he
had
never
before
heard
his
father
sing
the
result
filled
him
with
horror
ingleby
had
no
idea
of
tune
and
was
apparently
unconscious
of
this
disability
edwin
reflected
how
great
an
interest
music
had
been
in
his
life
realised
that
from
this
part
of
her
his
father
must
always
have
been
isolated
by
this
natural
barrier
it
was
he
began
to
wonder
what
they
really
had
in
common
he
remembered
griffin
no
not
this
speculation
he
did
his
best
to
stifle
while
the
rector
galloped
over
the
desert
wastes
of
the
litany
but
the
kneeling
posture
was
rendered
uncomfortable
by
the
presence
in
front
of
him
of
an
old
maiden
lady
who
smelt
of
caraway
seeds
a
spice
that
edwin
detested
a
hymn
followed
luckily
this
time
his
father
did
not
sing
poor
edwin
was
now
so
ashamed
of
his
criticism
that
he
almost
wished
he
would
and
then
they
settled
down
to
the
sermon
from
the
first
edwin
had
decided
that
he
would
not
listen
the
simple
austerity
of
the
service
at
where
the
liturgy
was
allowed
to
unfold
its
sonorous
splendours
for
itself
had
bred
in
him
a
distaste
for
the
histrionics
so
he
did
not
hear
them
contenting
himself
with
a
detailed
examination
of
such
of
the
congregation
as
were
within
his
range
he
saw
them
classified
in
their
social
gradations
from
the
pompous
distinction
of
sir
joseph
hingston
the
ironmaster
who
in
spite
of
his
baronetcy
wore
a
frock
coat
that
did
not
differ
greatly
from
that
of
ingleby
to
their
late
maid
dressed
in
black
and
now
conscious
of
the
reflected
glory
that
she
had
almost
sacrificed
by
leaving
and
the
thing
that
impressed
him
most
about
this
very
various
gathering
was
their
shabbiness
and
the
fact
that
nearly
all
of
those
whom
he
knew
seemed
so
much
older
than
they
had
been
when
he
last
saw
them
thinking
of
the
light
and
elegance
and
cleanliness
of
it
appeared
to
him
that
halesby
was
indeed
a
muddy
and
obscure
backwater
and
that
his
own
people
sitting
in
the
pew
beside
him
were
in
reality
as
much
fitted
to
inhabit
it
as
all
the
rest
of
the
shabby
congregation
even
the
willises
his
new
friends
whom
a
wave
of
commercial
prosperity
had
carried
forward
into
one
of
the
front
pews
of
the
nave
within
calculable
distance
of
the
glory
of
sir
joseph
hingston
himself
would
have
looked
very
ordinary
folk
in
the
chapel
at
he
began
to
wonder
if
griffin
and
more
latterly
aunt
laura
had
been
right
whether
after
all
his
mother
had
made
an
ambitious
mistake
in
sending
him
to
a
public
school
when
the
ancient
foundation
of
the
halesby
grammar
school
had
stood
waiting
for
the
reception
of
him
and
his
kind
there
in
the
fifth
row
on
the
left
of
the
nave
sat
kelly
the
grammar
a
swarthy
irishman
with
a
sinister
rather
disappointed
face
he
at
all
idea
of
a
schoolmaster
even
old
fat
leeming
looked
more
distinguished
than
that
and
yet
if
he
were
good
enough
for
the
son
of
the
opulent
walter
willis
he
must
surely
be
good
enough
for
the
son
of
an
ordinary
halesby
tradesman
for
the
greater
part
of
the
sermon
these
problems
of
social
precedence
engaged
puzzled
mind
it
had
come
as
something
of
a
shock
to
him
to
find
that
his
mother
came
of
a
farming
stock
even
though
the
farmers
had
lived
in
a
norman
castle
and
had
once
been
good
enough
to
bear
a
lance
in
company
with
the
lords
marchers
examining
the
face
of
his
father
who
appeared
to
be
engrossed
in
the
rhetoric
edwin
decided
that
his
features
were
really
far
too
distinguished
to
belong
naturally
to
a
country
chemist
here
perhaps
in
spite
of
present
circumstance
lay
the
explanation
of
his
own
indubitable
gentility
it
was
funny
he
reflected
that
he
had
never
heard
anything
from
his
mother
about
the
origins
of
the
inglebys
he
had
not
even
known
from
what
part
of
the
country
their
stock
had
sprung
and
this
ignorance
made
the
expedition
on
which
they
were
to
start
on
the
morrow
more
enthralling
than
ever
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
discovery
of
some
illustrious
ancestry
might
put
him
right
with
himself
and
justify
his
claim
to
a
birthright
which
at
present
seemed
rather
shadowy
even
if
this
failed
he
decided
there
remained
oxford
a
fellow
of
balliol
his
imagination
travelled
fast
would
have
a
right
to
hold
up
his
head
with
any
one
in
that
joseph
hingston
not
though
the
name
of
the
father
happened
to
be
printed
on
his
toothbrush
it
might
even
be
for
him
to
restore
the
prestige
of
the
ingleby
name
in
that
case
he
thought
will
be
better
for
me
to
buy
my
toothbrushes
somewhere
else
even
the
fact
that
keats
was
a
chemist
did
not
modify
this
determination
the
sermon
ended
and
during
the
collection
a
hymn
was
sung
half
an
hour
before
this
a
gowned
verger
had
stolen
on
tiptoe
to
the
pew
and
whispered
in
ear
depositing
a
wooden
plate
lined
with
velvet
under
the
seat
as
furtively
as
if
it
were
something
of
which
he
was
ashamed
when
the
collection
began
father
left
his
pew
and
began
to
carry
the
plate
round
the
transept
in
which
they
were
seated
edwin
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
saw
a
glow
of
satisfaction
spread
over
the
features
of
aunt
laura
now
more
than
ever
the
depth
of
the
grief
was
to
be
demonstrated
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
edwin
thought
it
was
a
rotten
shame
to
make
his
father
collect
on
this
sunday
of
all
sundays
the
hymn
was
a
short
one
and
for
several
minutes
after
it
was
finished
the
clink
of
silver
and
the
duller
sound
of
copper
coins
was
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
echoing
church
then
the
formed
themselves
into
a
double
file
and
moved
singly
up
the
aisle
first
came
sir
joseph
hingston
erect
and
podgy
with
his
smooth
grey
waistcoat
in
front
of
him
like
the
breast
of
a
pouter
pigeon
willis
of
mawne
with
a
humbler
but
not
unambitious
abdominal
development
followed
him
edwin
conceived
a
fanciful
theory
that
when
willis
in
the
course
of
time
should
have
grown
as
wealthy
as
the
baronet
there
would
be
nothing
to
choose
between
their
profiles
a
miserly
but
erect
old
gentleman
named
farr
who
had
once
given
edwin
a
halfpenny
followed
willis
last
but
one
came
father
with
the
undertaker
an
eager
last
on
the
whole
edwin
was
satisfied
as
was
obviously
aunt
laura
with
appearance
he
certainly
looked
more
like
the
father
of
a
fellow
of
balliol
than
sir
joseph
hingston
the
money
descended
with
a
series
of
opulent
splashes
into
the
brass
salver
that
the
rector
held
in
front
of
the
chancel
steps
the
organist
in
private
life
he
was
a
carpenter
meanwhile
extemporising
vaguely
in
the
key
of
the
rector
carried
the
salver
to
the
altar
as
though
he
were
exhibiting
to
the
almighty
the
personal
fruits
of
his
oratory
ingleby
stole
quietly
to
his
seat
bathed
in
the
admiring
glances
of
aunt
laura
a
short
prayer
now
to
god
the
the
organist
launched
into
his
latest
achievement
the
gavotte
from
mignon
outside
the
church
the
summer
sunlight
seemed
more
exhilarating
than
ever
it
was
worth
while
edwin
thought
to
have
suffered
the
dreariness
of
the
service
to
experience
this
curious
feeling
of
lightness
and
relief
he
supposed
that
he
was
not
alone
in
this
sensation
for
the
crowd
that
moved
slowly
from
the
churchyard
gates
with
a
kind
of
gathering
resilience
was
a
happy
crowd
and
its
voices
that
at
first
were
hushed
soon
became
gay
and
irresponsible
in
spite
of
the
slight
awkwardness
that
its
sunday
clothes
imposed
on
it
no
doubt
they
were
anticipating
their
sunday
dinner
for
as
edwin
had
noticed
the
liturgy
of
the
church
of
england
has
some
value
as
an
even
aunt
laura
was
full
of
a
subdued
playfulness
a
shame
albert
she
said
the
rector
appoint
you
to
collect
she
patted
his
arm
i
know
my
it
my
turn
you
i
know
that
said
aunt
laura
on
a
day
like
this
it
would
have
been
rather
a
delicate
compliment
i
must
speak
to
the
rector
about
think
i
should
do
that
said
uncle
albert
with
some
alarm
she
laughed
gently
be
an
old
juggins
she
said
all
down
the
high
street
in
the
moving
crowd
edwin
could
smell
the
savour
of
roast
beef
and
baked
potatoes
and
cabbage
water
wafted
from
innumerable
kitchen
iv
in
the
afternoon
they
left
aunt
laura
and
uncle
albert
asleep
in
two
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fireplace
and
edwin
and
his
father
went
for
a
walk
by
the
old
abbey
it
was
the
first
time
for
many
years
that
edwin
had
been
for
a
walk
with
his
father
and
the
experience
promised
a
new
and
exciting
intimacy
to
which
he
looked
forward
with
eagerness
even
at
this
hour
of
the
day
the
sabbath
atmosphere
imposed
itself
on
the
countryside
the
road
that
they
followed
was
long
and
straight
with
an
open
frontage
above
the
reedy
pools
and
along
the
cinder
path
at
the
side
of
it
a
great
number
of
men
were
lounging
a
strange
and
foreign
population
of
miners
from
the
mawne
pits
who
only
emerged
from
their
cavernous
occupation
on
this
day
of
the
week
and
other
industrial
workers
from
the
great
steel
rolling
mills
that
lay
in
the
stour
valley
to
westward
none
of
them
took
any
notice
of
edwin
and
his
father
it
was
even
doubtful
if
they
knew
who
they
were
for
these
men
passed
a
curiously
separate
existence
and
ingleby
would
only
be
familiar
to
their
wives
who
did
the
family
shopping
on
saturday
nights
while
their
masters
were
waiting
for
the
football
results
in
their
favourite
pubs
on
this
day
the
passion
for
sport
of
all
kinds
asserted
itself
in
the
presence
of
a
great
number
of
slim
jacketed
whippets
each
warranted
to
beat
anything
on
four
legs
for
speed
slinking
tenderly
at
their
heels
it
seemed
strange
to
edwin
that
his
father
should
know
none
of
these
men
it
showed
him
again
how
remote
and
solitary
the
life
must
have
been
in
this
ultimate
corner
of
the
black
country
really
belong
here
he
thought
foreigners
and
the
reflection
pleased
him
though
he
remembered
with
a
tinge
of
regret
that
by
this
denial
he
dissociated
himself
from
his
old
idol
the
poet
of
the
pastoral
ballad
soon
they
left
the
cinder
path
behind
and
plunged
into
a
green
lane
descending
to
a
turned
by
the
tawny
stour
as
yet
unsullied
by
the
refuse
of
factories
at
a
sandstone
bridge
whose
parapet
was
deeply
carved
with
the
initials
of
lovers
long
since
dead
or
disillusioned
they
paused
and
for
the
first
time
began
to
talk
a
funny
thing
father
edwin
said
i
even
know
where
we
are
going
ingleby
smiled
you
edwin
well
the
doctor
said
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
go
to
my
native
air
and
it
struck
me
as
rather
a
good
plan
i
never
went
there
with
your
mother
it
belonged
to
another
life
it
is
quite
twenty
years
since
i
have
been
in
i
even
know
it
was
well
as
i
say
it
was
another
imagination
began
to
play
with
the
word
he
could
remember
very
little
only
a
huge
green
county
sprawling
on
a
map
with
rivers
yes
and
hills
a
county
stretched
beside
the
severn
sea
the
severn
again
a
western
county
cheddar
cheese
lorna
doone
cider
coleridge
sedgemoor
what
part
of
somerset
eastern
that
was
a
pity
the
farther
west
the
better
suppose
rather
a
flat
county
great
part
of
it
did
you
ever
hear
of
mendip
rugged
miners
poured
to
war
from
sunless
of
course
came
from
a
little
village
on
the
top
of
mendip
twenty
years
ago
it
was
decaying
now
i
expect
next
to
nothing
left
of
it
twenty
years
makes
a
lot
of
difference
made
a
lot
of
difference
to
what
was
the
name
of
the
village
suppose
you
will
ever
have
heard
it
it
was
called
no
a
jolly
think
it
ever
struck
me
in
that
is
it
right
in
the
hills
quite
high
up
i
know
how
many
hundreds
of
feet
i
interested
in
that
sort
of
thing
then
it
lies
right
under
axdown
the
highest
point
of
the
range
on
a
clear
day
you
can
see
right
over
the
bristol
channel
into
wales
all
the
mountains
there
the
brecon
beacons
the
sugarloaf
the
black
black
mountain
but
how
strange
why
when
you
were
a
little
boy
you
must
have
been
nearly
able
to
see
the
place
where
mother
lived
with
a
big
sea
between
it
must
have
been
wonderful
i
suppose
it
was
i
scarcely
remember
look
right
down
in
that
deep
pool
a
where
do
show
me
the
vision
of
mendip
faded
instantly
and
edwin
only
saw
the
rufous
sands
of
the
pool
beneath
the
bridge
and
in
it
a
shadowy
elongated
figure
with
its
head
to
the
slow
stream
and
faintly
quivering
fins
in
devonshire
widdup
had
told
him
the
rivers
swarmed
with
trout
you
could
catch
them
all
day
long
if
you
wanted
to
and
edwin
loyal
to
his
own
excellences
had
only
been
able
to
produce
the
silvery
roach
of
the
millpool
shoaling
round
the
and
the
mythical
legend
of
carnivorous
pike
lurking
in
ponds
in
the
holloway
he
wished
he
had
known
that
there
were
veritable
trout
in
the
stour
now
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
but
when
they
returned
from
their
holiday
he
determined
that
he
would
catch
this
shadowy
creature
even
if
he
had
to
induce
it
to
gorge
a
worm
still
it
was
quite
possible
that
by
the
time
he
returned
he
would
have
captured
many
trout
for
somerset
lay
next
to
devon
on
the
map
there
many
trout
in
mendip
he
asked
there
is
only
one
river
of
any
size
the
ax
that
runs
underground
and
comes
out
of
axcombe
gorge
and
there
are
practically
no
trout
in
the
ax
a
dry
country
limestone
very
barren
that
really
matter
in
a
day
or
two
edwin
would
be
able
to
see
for
himself
on
their
way
home
they
spoke
very
little
his
father
seemed
to
find
it
difficult
to
talk
to
him
and
in
a
little
while
edwin
became
conscious
of
his
own
unending
string
of
questions
that
led
nowhere
but
all
that
night
he
dreamed
of
mendip
a
vast
barren
his
dreams
pictured
it
waterless
and
honeycombed
with
the
dark
caves
from
which
miners
had
poured
to
war
a
deserted
countryside
full
of
broken
villages
and
bounded
by
steep
cliffs
against
which
the
isolating
waters
of
the
severn
sea
broke
in
a
soundless
tumult
and
there
ax
the
sacred
river
ran
through
caverns
measureless
to
man
a
fluent
gentleman
with
a
noble
brow
and
burning
grey
eyes
pointed
out
the
course
of
the
river
to
him
he
was
the
only
other
soul
beside
edwin
and
his
father
in
all
that
desert
country
and
edwin
introduced
him
to
ingleby
as
diffidently
for
he
was
not
sure
how
the
poet
would
take
it
until
he
remembered
and
explained
that
keats
was
a
chemist
there
on
the
high
crown
of
axdown
his
mother
joined
them
she
it
seemed
was
not
afraid
of
coleridge
she
took
his
arm
so
familiarly
that
edwin
trembled
for
her
but
the
poet
only
smiled
while
she
pointed
out
to
him
a
mass
of
huge
fantastic
mountains
ranged
beyond
the
gleaming
sea
got
to
look
over
there
she
said
see
that
level
ridge
dropping
suddenly
well
the
third
farm
from
the
end
can
you
see
the
little
bedroom
window
on
the
extreme
left
quite
a
little
window
coleridge
nodded
and
ingleby
too
shielded
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
looked
was
my
last
chance
of
showing
it
to
you
she
said
there
are
practically
no
trout
in
the
alph
said
coleridge
chapter
xi
the
threshold
i
the
next
evening
when
edwin
and
his
father
reached
bristol
a
steady
drizzle
had
set
in
from
the
west
they
pushed
their
bicycles
out
of
the
station
yard
at
temple
meads
and
rode
between
slippery
tramway
lines
towards
a
small
hotel
a
from
bristol
bridge
where
ingleby
had
decided
to
put
up
for
the
night
no
use
trying
to
ride
on
to
wringford
this
evening
he
said
the
wind
will
be
against
us
and
collar
work
most
of
the
way
i
think
we
can
be
comfortable
here
i
used
to
know
the
landlord
of
this
place
he
was
a
mendip
the
mendip
landlord
of
course
had
been
dead
for
many
years
having
made
his
descent
by
the
route
that
is
particularly
easy
for
licensed
victuallers
but
it
happened
that
his
daughter
had
married
the
new
tenant
and
this
woman
a
comfortable
creature
who
spoke
with
the
slight
burr
that
appeared
in
speech
in
times
of
anger
or
any
other
violent
emotion
welcomed
them
for
her
sake
and
gave
them
a
bare
but
cleanly
room
on
the
second
story
the
windows
of
this
room
looked
down
obliquely
on
to
the
tidal
basin
of
the
avon
thronged
with
small
coasting
tramps
and
sailing
ships
and
edwin
was
content
to
stay
there
watching
them
for
he
had
never
seen
the
traffic
of
a
harbour
before
it
was
still
too
wet
to
think
of
going
out
onto
the
quays
but
even
from
a
distance
the
misty
spectacle
enveloped
in
veils
of
driving
rain
was
romantic
edwin
watched
while
a
pair
of
busy
tugboats
pushed
and
pulled
and
worried
the
hull
of
a
wooden
schooner
in
to
the
water
was
high
and
she
was
due
to
catch
the
falling
tide
to
avonmouth
whither
was
she
bound
he
did
not
know
perhaps
her
way
lay
down
channel
to
pick
up
a
cargo
of
bricks
from
bridgewater
perhaps
she
was
setting
out
at
that
moment
to
essay
the
icy
passage
of
the
horn
perhaps
in
another
four
months
she
would
have
doubled
the
cape
and
lie
wallowing
in
the
torpid
seas
about
zanzibar
it
inspired
edwin
to
think
that
he
was
standing
at
one
of
the
gateways
of
the
world
from
the
site
of
the
stone
bridge
above
their
lodging
just
four
hundred
years
ago
the
venetian
pilot
cabot
had
cast
loose
in
the
selfsame
way
and
sailed
westward
with
his
three
sons
lewes
sebastyan
and
sancto
to
the
mainland
of
unknown
america
from
the
same
wet
quays
other
adventurous
prows
were
stretching
forth
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
china
to
africa
begins
the
sea
that
ends
not
till
the
with
his
accustomed
curiosity
as
to
the
origins
of
his
own
emotions
edwin
was
not
long
in
deciding
that
his
growing
eagerness
to
see
the
beauty
and
strangeness
of
the
world
must
have
sprung
from
the
fact
that
his
ancestors
had
lived
upon
the
shores
of
this
great
waterway
from
highberrow
his
father
had
told
him
you
could
see
the
whole
expanse
of
the
bristol
channel
from
highberrow
perhaps
some
forbear
of
his
own
had
watched
the
caravels
of
cabot
setting
down
channel
with
the
ebb
tide
he
was
bewildered
with
the
splendour
of
his
heritage
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
that
sir
joseph
family
had
the
least
share
in
such
a
romantic
past
in
the
evening
after
supper
the
rain
ceased
and
ingleby
proposed
that
they
should
go
for
a
walk
through
the
city
he
had
known
it
well
in
his
youth
and
it
seemed
to
fill
him
with
an
almost
childish
delight
to
show
edwin
the
things
that
he
remembered
they
passed
through
many
narrow
winding
streets
where
the
overhanging
houses
of
the
merchant
venturers
stood
and
ancient
churches
had
been
huddled
into
corners
by
the
growing
city
remember
every
inch
of
it
said
ingleby
with
a
happy
laugh
again
they
crossed
the
river
and
skirting
a
line
of
shipping
warehouses
now
cavernous
and
deserted
they
plunged
into
a
sordid
quarter
full
of
drinking
dens
that
smelled
of
rum
and
marine
stores
that
smelled
of
tar
are
we
going
edwin
asked
see
in
a
minute
said
ingleby
and
in
a
minute
edwin
saw
they
had
emerged
from
the
huddled
houses
into
a
large
open
space
and
in
the
midst
of
it
rose
a
miracle
of
beauty
such
as
edwin
had
never
seen
before
a
structure
too
delicate
in
its
airy
loveliness
to
have
been
built
of
stone
so
fragile
in
its
strength
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
slender
flying
buttresses
should
support
it
the
shadowy
spire
could
be
seen
dimly
piercing
a
sky
that
had
been
washed
to
clearness
by
the
rain
but
inside
the
church
for
some
reason
unknown
the
lamps
had
been
lighted
and
the
whole
building
glowed
as
though
it
had
been
one
immense
lantern
there
could
not
be
another
miracle
of
this
kind
in
the
world
edwin
thought
he
remembered
a
white
model
of
the
taj
mahal
at
agra
that
stood
beneath
a
dome
of
glass
in
an
intricate
carving
of
ivory
with
a
huge
dome
and
many
fretted
minarets
edwin
remembered
that
the
taj
mahal
was
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
but
he
could
not
believe
that
it
was
as
beautiful
as
this
it
was
too
fanciful
too
complicated
in
its
detail
while
this
church
for
all
its
delicacy
was
so
amazingly
simple
in
its
design
mary
redcliffe
said
ingleby
always
thought
it
was
a
fine
church
but
i
think
i
ever
saw
it
lit
up
like
this
he
paused
and
they
gazed
at
the
church
for
a
little
while
in
silence
a
funny
thing
he
said
at
last
a
great
master
can
sign
a
picture
and
the
name
of
a
poet
be
remembered
by
his
writings
while
the
greatest
artists
of
the
middle
ages
people
who
planned
and
built
wonderful
things
like
this
and
i
suppose
it
is
more
beautiful
than
when
it
was
first
finished
should
be
quite
forgotten
a
funny
i
should
think
the
man
who
made
this
church
must
have
devoted
his
life
to
edwin
glowed
it
came
as
a
delightful
surprise
to
him
that
his
father
should
think
of
a
thing
like
this
he
was
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
believed
him
capable
of
it
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
he
would
only
have
expected
of
his
mother
a
rotten
little
snob
i
am
he
thought
and
though
he
happened
to
know
quite
by
accident
from
the
rowley
poems
of
chatterton
that
the
builder
of
redcliffe
was
william
cannynge
round
whose
shadowy
reputation
the
work
of
the
wondrous
boy
had
grown
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
reveal
this
piece
of
learning
since
it
would
have
spoiled
the
originality
of
his
reflection
he
only
said
but
the
train
of
thought
was
so
strong
in
him
that
he
resist
asking
ingleby
if
he
knew
which
was
the
muniment
room
muniment
room
why
it
was
in
the
muniment
room
that
chatterton
pretended
that
he
found
the
rowley
ah
thomas
chatterton
the
afraid
i
know
i
never
read
any
of
his
poems
but
i
believe
he
starved
in
london
and
committed
suicide
with
arsenious
this
gleam
of
professional
interest
tickled
edwin
keats
beatings
chatterton
arsenious
oxide
found
arsenic
on
his
lips
he
made
no
mistake
about
it
the
lethal
dose
is
a
very
small
one
a
grain
or
so
would
have
done
it
why
beginning
to
rain
again
better
go
i
hope
it
will
clear
up
by
they
walked
back
to
their
lodging
in
a
fine
drizzle
on
the
way
father
took
his
arm
the
action
gave
edwin
a
curious
sensation
it
suggested
to
him
that
his
father
was
lonely
that
the
natural
instinct
of
love
in
the
man
was
making
him
eager
for
some
sort
of
sympathy
it
was
pitiable
for
in
reality
they
were
strangers
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
that
they
were
strangers
must
make
it
easy
for
him
edwin
thought
impossible
it
may
seem
i
must
make
it
easy
i
must
know
him
i
must
love
him
whatever
it
costs
i
must
love
him
it
is
ridiculous
that
i
should
have
to
choose
my
words
and
even
at
times
be
a
little
dishonest
when
it
ought
to
be
the
most
natural
and
easy
thing
in
the
world
to
be
myself
with
him
of
course
difficult
at
present
but
later
on
when
we
know
each
other
better
it
will
be
all
when
they
returned
to
their
lodging
their
clothes
were
wet
and
they
went
together
into
the
kitchen
of
the
defunct
daughter
she
gave
them
two
of
her
coats
to
wear
while
their
own
were
drying
and
for
a
long
time
they
sat
over
the
fire
talking
to
her
it
was
evident
that
though
ingleby
was
himself
unknown
to
her
she
knew
all
about
his
family
for
she
asked
him
many
questions
about
various
people
in
highberrow
and
wringford
whom
they
knew
in
common
ingleby
could
tell
her
very
little
but
the
landlady
was
able
to
supply
him
with
a
lot
of
gossip
from
the
mendip
villages
heard
that
you
were
married
she
said
replied
ingleby
just
had
a
great
blow
lost
my
dear
very
sad
for
i
shall
never
get
over
this
is
your
eldest
my
word
how
time
flies
the
only
look
at
him
at
first
you
say
there
was
much
of
an
ingleby
in
he
takes
after
his
yet
on
second
thoughts
got
a
look
of
your
brother
boy
joe
about
his
eyes
now
a
strange
thing
talking
of
your
brother
william
i
seen
or
heard
of
him
for
seen
him
for
twenty
years
myself
cycling
to
wringford
we
shall
put
up
with
remember
me
to
him
he
was
always
a
great
favourite
of
a
good
suppose
in
the
same
place
grisewood
would
be
a
fool
to
get
rid
of
a
man
like
that
good
gardeners
are
scarce
edwin
could
not
understand
this
at
all
it
was
obvious
that
the
woman
must
be
making
some
mistake
for
it
was
clearly
impossible
that
his
uncle
william
could
be
a
gardener
still
his
father
offered
no
protest
tell
me
she
went
on
in
her
soft
voice
apprenticed
that
boy
joe
to
hares
the
know
that
said
ingleby
of
course
it
may
be
all
right
the
landlady
went
on
always
the
future
to
think
on
my
husband
always
says
that
the
day
of
the
horse
is
over
what
with
steam
and
electricity
and
these
new
things
that
i
see
in
the
paper
they
are
running
from
london
to
brighton
a
gentleman
near
bridgewater
who
has
one
of
these
new
on
the
road
of
course
i
suppose
they
are
fairly
reliable
on
the
edwin
was
thankful
that
the
excitements
of
motor
traction
had
diverted
her
from
the
uncomfortable
subject
of
his
if
that
were
the
right
word
to
apply
to
the
calling
of
a
but
the
matter
still
troubled
and
bewildered
him
when
they
went
upstairs
to
bed
it
was
one
that
would
not
wait
for
explanation
and
so
he
tackled
his
father
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
what
was
that
woman
talking
about
what
did
she
mean
when
she
said
that
uncle
will
was
a
gardener
did
she
mean
ingleby
laughed
she
meant
what
she
said
he
a
gardener
never
been
anything
father
impossible
boy
the
truth
you
know
mother
ever
tell
you
i
think
she
ever
spoke
of
him
i
i
understand
sound
as
if
it
had
come
as
a
shock
to
you
yes
i
suppose
it
imagine
that
find
your
ancestry
in
debrett
eddie
but
different
sort
of
bowled
me
ingleby
laughed
it
seemed
that
he
was
really
amused
at
consternation
suppose
natural
for
a
schoolboy
to
be
a
bit
snobbish
he
said
it
that
honestly
it
father
only
kind
of
taken
us
for
granted
i
wish
tell
me
all
about
it
you
see
i
know
absolutely
a
long
story
eddie
but
of
course
tell
you
then
you
have
any
more
of
these
distressing
surprises
suppose
you
get
into
bed
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
edwin
to
see
his
father
kneel
down
in
his
jaeger
nightgown
and
pray
the
boy
had
never
done
that
since
his
second
term
at
ii
lying
in
bed
with
his
arm
about
him
edwin
listened
to
a
long
and
strange
narration
that
overwhelmed
him
with
alternations
of
humiliation
that
made
him
ashamed
and
of
romance
that
thrilled
him
ingleby
began
at
the
beginning
their
family
had
lived
it
appeared
for
years
without
number
in
the
village
of
highberrow
on
mendip
in
a
combe
beneath
the
great
camp
of
silbury
and
the
calling
of
all
these
inglebys
had
been
that
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
highberrow
they
were
miners
working
for
lead
in
the
seams
that
the
romans
and
perhaps
the
phoenicians
before
them
had
discovered
in
the
mountain
limestone
even
so
early
as
in
the
youth
of
father
the
industry
had
been
decaying
for
the
traditional
methods
of
the
mendip
miner
were
unscientific
he
had
been
content
to
dig
for
himself
a
shallow
working
from
which
he
collected
enough
of
the
mineral
that
is
called
calamine
to
keep
him
in
pocket
and
in
drink
mendip
folk
said
ingleby
a
strange
people
very
different
in
our
physique
from
the
broad
saxons
of
the
beneath
us
i
suppose
there
is
a
good
deal
of
cornish
blood
in
us
wherever
there
are
mines
there
are
cornishmen
but
i
think
another
older
strain
iberian
roman
phoenician
i
know
what
it
is
but
i
do
know
that
somehow
different
from
all
the
rest
of
the
somerset
people
a
violent
savage
sort
of
folk
did
you
ever
hear
of
hannah
more
edwin
had
been
born
too
late
in
the
century
she
was
before
my
time
too
but
she
made
the
mendip
miners
notorious
by
trying
to
convert
them
i
suppose
she
succeeded
at
any
rate
neither
she
nor
her
influences
would
ever
have
converted
your
grandfather
he
was
a
wonderful
man
even
though
my
memory
is
mostly
of
the
way
in
which
i
was
afraid
of
him
i
can
see
what
a
wonderful
man
he
was
and
your
uncle
will
would
tell
you
the
was
a
miner
a
miner
amongst
other
things
he
was
a
dowser
dowser
what
is
that
you
know
the
a
thing
that
all
the
scientists
have
been
unable
to
explain
in
a
dry
country
like
mendip
the
dowser
is
a
most
important
person
for
neither
man
nor
beast
can
live
without
water
and
he
is
the
only
person
who
can
tell
where
a
well
should
be
sunk
your
grandfather
was
a
strange
looking
man
with
very
clear
grey
eyes
under
a
black
head
of
hair
and
heavy
bristling
brows
even
when
he
grew
very
old
his
hair
and
his
beard
were
black
was
the
youngest
of
the
family
all
the
others
except
your
uncle
will
have
for
some
reason
or
other
i
was
not
brought
up
in
my
cottage
but
in
that
of
my
grandmother
a
tiny
tumbledown
affair
lying
in
the
valley
under
silbury
we
were
very
humble
people
eddie
i
suppose
anywhere
in
the
world
i
could
have
passed
a
quieter
childhood
a
long
way
off
now
one
only
remembers
curious
unimportant
things
i
was
four
years
old
i
was
sent
to
the
village
school
i
think
it
exists
any
longer
you
see
the
population
of
highberrow
disappeared
naturally
with
the
abandonment
of
the
mining
even
in
my
childhood
as
i
told
you
the
workings
were
running
pretty
thin
the
miners
were
beginning
to
find
that
they
pick
up
much
of
a
living
on
their
own
calamine
claims
and
so
they
drifted
back
grandfather
along
with
the
oldest
workings
of
all
the
mines
that
the
romans
had
made
two
thousand
years
ago
you
may
be
certain
that
the
romans
with
their
thoroughness
left
much
behind
why
in
their
days
mendip
must
have
been
a
great
place
with
a
harbour
of
its
own
on
the
mouth
of
the
ax
and
great
roads
radiating
everywhere
to
cirencester
exeter
and
bath
even
in
the
middle
ages
there
was
a
population
of
fifty
thousand
souls
on
mendip
now
i
suppose
there
are
a
thousand
in
all
the
mining
villages
put
together
my
father
went
to
work
in
the
roman
mines
at
cold
harbour
for
a
new
company
had
been
started
that
was
reclaiming
the
sublimated
lead
that
had
been
left
in
the
flues
and
there
as
a
little
boy
i
used
to
carry
him
his
dinner
through
the
heather
over
the
side
of
axdown
see
axdown
for
yourself
a
great
bow
of
a
hill
there
used
to
be
a
pair
of
ravens
that
built
there
seen
them
rising
in
great
wide
circles
they
seemed
very
big
to
me
i
was
almost
frightened
of
them
and
when
i
found
the
skeleton
of
a
sheep
one
day
on
the
top
of
axdown
under
the
barrows
i
made
sure
that
the
ravens
had
killed
it
suppose
i
was
a
pretty
intelligent
boy
i
know
that
the
men
at
the
workings
by
cold
harbour
where
i
took
dinner
used
to
joke
with
me
a
good
deal
they
used
to
like
the
way
in
which
i
hit
back
at
them
with
my
tongue
father
take
any
notice
of
it
he
was
always
the
same
dark
silent
man
with
very
few
words
and
no
feelings
as
imagine
except
the
violent
passions
into
which
he
would
burst
out
when
been
drinking
he
often
drink
though
he
was
a
good
man
eddie
a
good
and
so
i
myself
came
to
work
in
the
believe
it
you
know
father
so
unlike
you
and
course
it
was
long
before
i
knew
your
mother
and
it
does
seem
funny
looking
back
on
it
very
glad
now
mind
you
that
i
had
the
experience
a
fine
thing
for
any
man
at
some
time
of
his
life
to
have
had
to
face
the
necessity
of
earning
his
living
by
the
use
of
his
hands
never
know
what
that
means
i
suppose
a
while
i
was
working
at
cold
harbour
my
mother
died
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
grannie
had
died
some
years
before
and
her
cottage
under
silbury
had
been
left
was
no
one
living
in
highberrow
to
fill
was
already
tumbling
into
ruins
i
told
you
about
your
mother
i
know
that
i
can
tell
you
much
i
think
she
was
in
some
ways
a
little
hard
i
i
thought
the
world
of
her
and
perhaps
it
was
my
difficult
nature
that
made
her
seem
harder
than
she
was
besides
being
brought
up
with
grannie
i
was
a
sort
of
stranger
to
her
i
know
how
father
came
across
her
no
doubt
about
she
was
a
superior
woman
if
still
feeling
a
little
sore
about
your
social
origin
eddie
you
can
console
yourself
with
the
fact
that
she
had
a
cousin
who
was
a
was
it
a
clerk
near
london
at
any
rate
poor
soul
she
died
she
was
ill
for
several
months
and
i
being
the
youngest
had
to
stay
at
home
and
nurse
her
it
was
in
that
way
that
i
met
tell
you
about
him
in
a
moment
but
thinking
of
the
days
of
my
death
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
strange
thing
that
happened
at
the
time
that
will
show
you
what
sort
of
man
your
grandfather
was
early
on
in
the
family
there
had
been
a
girl
that
died
to
whom
my
mother
was
particularly
devoted
and
a
little
before
the
knew
that
it
be
many
told
my
father
that
she
would
like
to
be
buried
in
a
particular
corner
of
the
churchyard
near
to
this
daughter
of
theirs
never
spoke
of
it
he
rarely
spoke
of
anything
but
i
suppose
he
took
it
in
all
the
same
anyway
when
she
was
dead
the
old
sexton
came
up
to
see
father
about
the
grave
and
he
told
him
where
she
had
said
she
wanted
to
lie
the
next
night
the
sexton
came
up
again
i
can
see
him
funny
little
man
with
red
said
it
be
done
because
the
soil
was
so
shallow
at
that
particular
point
i
can
see
my
father
now
he
been
drinking
but
be
flew
suddenly
into
such
a
black
rage
that
the
poor
little
gravedigger
satell
was
his
name
ran
out
frightened
for
his
life
i
think
i
was
pretty
frightened
too
for
father
went
out
after
him
carrying
one
of
the
great
iron
bars
that
the
miners
use
for
drilling
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
the
loss
of
mother
had
turned
his
head
it
he
just
went
there
and
then
in
the
night
to
the
churchyard
and
worked
away
with
his
mining
tools
at
the
rock
that
poor
old
satell
said
he
dig
he
bored
his
holes
and
he
blasted
the
rock
with
the
black
powder
they
used
in
those
days
and
he
dug
my
grave
in
the
place
where
she
wanted
it
you
see
what
a
strange
man
he
was
you
may
say
what
you
like
often
thought
of
it
that
was
a
grandfather
worth
he
was
worth
having
edwin
agreed
i
was
speaking
of
marshall
his
father
continued
was
the
beginning
of
my
new
life
but
for
the
accident
of
my
illness
i
suppose
i
should
ever
have
met
him
during
the
last
month
he
came
fairly
often
not
that
he
could
do
much
good
for
her
poor
thing
but
because
she
a
wretched
superior
woman
and
because
no
doubt
she
liked
to
talk
to
him
and
he
knew
it
practice
in
highberrow
have
been
very
profitable
though
sure
that
my
father
paid
him
every
penny
that
he
owed
him
he
was
that
kind
of
man
when
she
died
marshall
took
a
fancy
to
me
i
could
tell
you
a
good
deal
about
him
if
it
were
worth
while
he
was
a
physician
of
the
old
school
learned
in
experience
rather
than
in
books
it
is
probable
that
he
made
mistakes
but
equally
certain
that
he
learned
by
them
the
week
after
mother
died
he
asked
your
grandfather
if
he
could
have
me
to
wash
bottles
and
make
myself
generally
useful
in
his
surgery
at
axcombe
and
my
father
refuse
it
would
have
been
unlike
him
if
he
had
done
so
for
i
think
his
idea
in
life
was
to
let
every
individual
work
out
his
own
salvation
for
himself
it
was
a
good
plan
for
it
made
the
responsibility
i
went
to
axcombe
to
house
there
was
plenty
of
hard
work
in
it
i
think
a
country
doctor
earns
a
poor
living
more
honestly
than
most
men
i
had
to
share
the
up
early
in
the
morning
that
was
no
hardship
to
a
son
clean
up
the
surgery
and
i
can
tell
you
it
took
some
cleaning
to
turn
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
harness
the
pony
if
the
message
that
called
him
took
him
over
roads
or
to
saddle
the
cob
if
the
hill
tracks
were
too
rough
for
wheels
i
had
long
night
journeys
on
my
own
for
the
doctor
in
spite
of
his
practical
head
for
dealing
with
disease
was
curiously
unmethodical
and
would
often
leave
behind
the
particular
instrument
that
he
wanted
most
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
boy
of
my
own
age
from
one
of
the
hill
villages
would
come
battering
at
the
door
as
though
his
life
depended
on
it
and
go
on
battering
you
know
as
if
they
thought
that
the
sound
of
it
would
make
me
get
up
more
quickly
perhaps
it
did
at
any
rate
i
can
remember
scrambling
downstairs
in
the
dark
and
reading
the
notes
that
the
doctor
sent
by
candlelight
and
then
i
would
turn
out
half
asleep
and
walk
over
the
hills
above
axcombe
when
the
gorge
was
swimming
to
the
brim
with
fine
milky
mist
and
a
single
step
if
one
were
silly
enough
to
go
dreaming
would
have
sent
one
spinning
down
a
sheer
four
hundred
feet
like
the
hunting
king
in
the
legend
forgetting
that
you
know
the
legend
and
have
never
seen
the
i
shall
never
forget
those
strange
i
think
i
had
begun
to
appreciate
mendip
until
i
walked
the
hills
at
night
i
found
that
i
could
think
so
clearly
and
i
was
just
beginning
you
see
to
have
so
much
to
think
about
highberrow
in
my
cottage
there
were
only
two
books
altogether
the
bible
and
a
tract
by
miss
hannah
more
called
religion
of
the
fashionable
but
house
at
axcombe
was
crammed
with
books
rubbish
most
of
them
i
expect
but
printed
books
and
whenever
i
was
not
working
i
was
reading
it
was
the
pure
excitement
of
attaining
knowledge
of
any
kind
that
made
me
read
and
of
course
i
wasted
a
great
deal
of
valuable
time
in
ways
that
were
unprofitable
the
doctor
did
not
help
me
much
he
was
far
too
busy
to
worry
much
about
my
education
but
i
know
that
he
approved
of
my
eagerness
and
liked
to
see
me
reading
i
used
to
sleep
in
the
loft
above
the
stable
in
those
days
and
i
know
that
my
candles
made
him
rather
nervous
of
fire
but
he
did
help
me
in
his
own
way
he
put
me
on
to
a
little
latin
with
the
strictly
practical
idea
of
making
it
more
easy
for
me
to
dispense
the
prescriptions
that
he
wrote
in
the
old
manner
without
abbreviations
and
he
also
introduced
me
to
another
book
that
i
suppose
ever
heard
of
called
by
sir
thomas
know
it
said
edwin
you
i
supposed
it
was
merely
a
medical
curiosity
latin
he
thought
would
be
useful
to
me
in
other
ways
you
see
like
many
of
the
old
medical
practitioners
that
spent
their
lives
in
the
lanes
he
was
very
interested
in
botany
not
scientific
the
identification
and
botanical
names
of
the
flowers
that
blossomed
year
by
year
in
the
hedges
in
the
early
summer
he
would
drive
home
with
the
bottom
of
the
dogcart
tangled
with
flowers
that
he
had
picked
while
he
walked
the
pony
up
some
hill
and
he
would
pitch
them
over
to
me
and
tell
me
to
learn
the
names
of
them
it
very
difficult
for
in
the
surgery
shelves
there
was
a
fine
set
of
ann
pratt
with
excellent
illustrations
and
sometimes
he
would
come
home
with
a
small
insect
of
some
kind
in
a
pillbox
and
arrange
it
under
the
microscope
on
the
table
under
the
dispensary
window
and
say
wonderful
not
because
made
any
biological
observations
but
just
because
it
revealed
a
lot
of
unsuspected
detail
was
a
favourite
trick
of
his
to
show
his
patients
a
sample
of
their
own
blood
corpuscles
under
the
microscope
too
they
are
say
a
pile
of
golden
guineas
and
if
you
had
a
millionth
part
as
many
guineas
as
you
have
of
these
in
your
body
be
the
richest
man
in
this
sort
of
thing
used
to
impress
his
tremendously
and
he
knew
it
i
suppose
it
gave
them
confidence
in
him
though
he
need
any
superstitious
aids
of
this
kind
the
whole
history
of
his
life
as
a
doctor
should
have
been
enough
to
make
them
trust
him
still
i
suppose
it
was
the
old
tradition
of
the
medicine
man
who
dealt
in
curious
magic
his
common
sense
and
the
craftsmanship
that
he
had
won
by
experience
were
his
real
guarantees
was
extraordinarily
practical
in
everything
except
money
matters
in
these
even
i
could
have
taught
him
a
good
deal
it
was
a
pathetic
sight
to
see
him
making
out
his
bills
he
always
put
off
the
evil
day
with
the
result
that
they
were
only
sent
out
about
once
in
three
years
i
suppose
doctors
can
afford
to
be
like
that
in
these
but
then
what
was
the
use
of
money
to
him
all
his
tastes
were
simple
and
inexpensive
he
was
unmarried
during
all
the
years
that
i
was
with
him
he
never
took
a
holiday
unless
it
were
to
go
to
taunton
and
buy
a
new
horse
i
do
not
think
there
are
many
of
his
kind
left
can
see
though
what
a
huge
difference
he
made
to
my
life
if
i
gone
to
live
with
him
at
axcombe
i
might
still
have
been
a
there
any
miners
left
on
perhaps
a
gardener
like
your
uncle
will
and
where
would
you
have
been
eddie
he
was
careful
and
i
think
very
wisely
careful
not
to
turn
my
head
he
would
say
to
me
all
very
well
in
moderation
but
be
too
ambitious
john
happiness
is
more
important
in
this
life
than
success
and
very
few
men
have
a
full
share
of
both
still
a
sharp
lad
and
no
reason
why
you
get
on
in
the
world
and
be
happy
too
if
you
expect
too
as
time
went
on
we
began
to
talk
a
little
about
my
future
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
he
used
to
say
young
and
plenty
of
time
ahead
of
course
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
i
ambitions
naturally
enough
i
had
determined
to
be
a
doctor
like
my
master
the
small
things
that
i
did
for
him
convinced
me
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
when
he
was
out
in
the
country
people
who
had
walked
in
from
remote
villages
would
ask
me
to
prescribe
for
them
and
sometimes
with
an
immense
sense
of
importance
i
would
do
so
it
difficult
he
ran
his
practice
to
all
intents
and
purposes
on
three
stock
mixtures
and
half
a
dozen
pills
but
i
shall
never
forget
one
evening
when
one
of
my
fellow
workmen
from
highberrow
came
in
with
a
raging
toothache
and
i
being
anxious
to
show
off
volunteered
to
take
the
tooth
out
for
him
i
remember
i
showed
him
a
microscopic
sample
of
his
own
blood
as
a
preliminary
but
when
i
came
to
take
out
the
tooth
i
made
a
mess
of
it
he
was
a
tremendous
big
fellow
with
jaws
like
steel
and
though
i
pulled
hard
enough
to
move
him
in
the
chair
i
only
succeeded
in
breaking
the
tooth
and
making
the
pain
worse
i
got
my
head
well
smacked
for
my
trouble
and
decided
that
whatever
else
i
were
to
be
i
risk
dentistry
as
a
career
no
reason
the
doctor
would
say
you
make
a
good
chemist
in
of
course
that
seemed
a
very
small
thing
to
me
and
yet
think
what
i
might
have
been
i
was
sixteen
just
your
own
age
eddie
when
he
died
of
course
he
killed
himself
as
many
doctors
do
with
work
people
make
a
great
fuss
when
a
missionary
in
some
outlandish
country
lays
down
his
life
as
they
call
it
for
his
flock
but
country
doctors
are
doing
that
every
month
in
the
year
all
over
mean
the
social
successes
in
harley
from
what
seen
of
it
their
widows
count
on
much
gratitude
was
a
hard
winter
the
year
eighteen
and
there
happened
to
be
a
great
deal
of
illness
in
the
hills
we
were
worked
pretty
hard
both
of
us
but
the
doctor
had
no
chance
of
taking
a
rest
he
was
the
only
medical
man
living
within
ten
miles
and
in
the
end
he
too
caught
a
heavy
cold
and
had
to
go
on
working
through
it
in
the
end
he
had
to
give
up
it
was
pneumonia
and
the
last
thing
he
did
was
to
write
a
letter
asking
a
consultant
in
bristol
to
come
down
and
see
him
he
was
a
kindly
man
but
i
suppose
marshall
was
to
him
only
a
case
the
old
fellow
refused
to
have
any
one
but
me
to
nurse
him
and
i
understand
each
other
he
said
was
a
terrible
battle
to
see
a
great
strong
man
like
that
fighting
for
breath
they
give
oxygen
in
those
days
it
went
on
for
four
days
and
on
the
fifth
or
rather
in
the
middle
of
the
called
to
me
faintly
and
i
found
him
lying
on
his
back
breathing
more
softly
very
pale
and
drenched
with
sweat
is
the
crisis
fifth
day
he
said
he
told
me
to
cover
him
with
all
the
blankets
i
could
find
to
give
him
some
brandy
and
to
take
his
temperature
it
was
a
funny
job
for
a
boy
i
had
never
seen
a
great
man
suddenly
go
weak
like
that
his
temperature
had
fallen
below
normal
he
said
thought
he
take
it
himself
got
to
be
the
doctor
now
john
he
said
there
any
more
fight
left
in
him
all
that
day
he
hardly
spoke
at
all
but
at
night
he
called
me
to
his
side
and
told
me
to
make
a
bonfire
of
all
the
books
and
the
bills
been
making
out
the
week
before
want
any
more
money
he
said
you
will
a
seen
to
that
a
good
lad
aim
too
high
and
think
too
much
about
money
money
is
the
root
of
all
scarcely
took
any
notice
of
what
he
said
i
only
knew
that
i
was
going
to
lose
the
only
friend
i
had
he
died
early
next
morning
and
i
was
just
like
a
dog
i
bring
myself
to
leave
him
stayed
in
the
house
you
see
it
seemed
as
if
i
go
anywhere
else
until
after
the
funeral
then
the
lawyers
told
me
that
he
had
left
me
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
his
will
it
seemed
to
me
a
tremendous
lot
of
money
i
realise
what
a
little
way
it
would
go
but
it
seemed
to
make
my
dreams
possible
i
would
be
a
doctor
like
him
as
near
like
him
as
it
was
possible
to
be
that
was
my
first
idea
but
then
i
remembered
what
he
had
told
me
and
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
become
a
chemist
first
in
that
way
i
could
make
sure
of
my
living
left
axcombe
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
go
to
some
big
city
to
study
and
more
or
less
by
accident
i
chose
north
bromwich
it
was
a
tremendous
change
for
me
who
had
lived
all
my
life
in
the
country
i
was
very
lonely
and
awkward
at
first
but
that
the
worse
of
it
i
began
to
discover
my
own
ignorance
to
see
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
knew
nothing
but
the
homely
routine
of
the
surgery
the
names
of
a
few
drugs
and
their
doses
a
smattering
of
latin
and
the
botany
of
the
local
wild
flowers
i
knew
nothing
of
life
i
even
pull
out
a
tooth
without
breaking
it
came
as
an
awful
shock
to
me
i
began
to
see
the
reasons
of
the
cautious
advice
he
realised
that
i
had
a
great
deal
of
the
dreamer
in
me
i
rather
think
that
you
have
it
too
eddie
no
doubt
it
comes
to
both
of
us
from
those
strange
dark
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
pull
myself
together
and
drive
myself
hard
if
my
ambitions
were
not
to
end
in
disaster
i
had
to
pinch
and
scrape
i
had
to
set
out
and
learn
the
most
elementary
things
from
the
beginning
i
had
thought
that
my
fortune
was
made
perhaps
it
was
a
wise
thing
that
the
doctor
had
left
me
no
more
money
it
taught
me
that
nobody
could
make
my
fortune
but
myself
was
a
hard
fight
i
can
tell
you
for
while
i
was
building
my
schemes
for
the
future
i
had
to
provide
for
the
present
you
see
i
had
soon
realised
that
it
do
to
spend
any
of
my
little
capital
i
tell
you
now
how
i
lived
it
would
be
too
long
a
story
but
i
can
assure
you
that
i
had
a
hard
time
in
north
bromwich
getting
all
my
dreams
knocked
out
of
me
one
by
one
thirsting
for
clean
air
and
country
ways
sounds
rather
like
a
tract
but
quite
true
to
say
that
town
life
has
a
lot
of
temptations
too
for
a
country
boy
i
could
see
everywhere
the
power
of
money
and
the
luxuries
that
money
could
purchase
without
realising
the
work
that
money
represents
and
all
this
was
very
disconcerting
to
a
boy
of
my
temperament
with
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
in
the
bank
still
as
it
happened
nothing
went
wrong
in
the
i
worked
with
my
hands
at
night
i
tried
to
educate
myself
very
slowly
very
in
those
days
poor
people
had
not
the
opportunities
of
education
that
are
open
to
them
in
these
i
sometimes
wonder
if
people
realise
the
difference
worked
on
quietly
for
years
never
wasting
a
penny
or
an
hour
take
it
for
virtue
in
me
it
that
it
was
just
that
the
old
influence
on
me
had
been
sound
and
i
afford
to
do
otherwise
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
suppose
there
must
have
been
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
young
men
in
that
city
in
exactly
the
same
situation
only
i
know
one
of
them
i
was
lonely
absolutely
solitary
i
never
heard
an
accent
of
my
own
speech
i
never
saw
a
patch
of
real
green
or
a
sky
that
smoke
in
it
i
made
my
friends
in
books
not
the
kind
of
books
that
been
brought
up
time
for
poetry
or
frills
of
that
kind
books
of
solid
facts
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
you
see
all
the
things
that
you
would
take
for
granted
having
known
them
as
a
birthright
so
to
speak
were
new
and
unknown
to
me
one
book
was
a
sort
of
gospel
to
me
it
was
called
written
by
a
man
named
smiles
when
you
hear
of
a
man
it
may
mot
mean
much
but
a
man
i
can
tell
you
means
a
good
deal
in
the
end
of
course
i
gradually
came
within
sight
of
my
ambition
from
a
to
a
firm
of
wholesale
chemists
i
became
an
assistant
an
apprentice
in
their
retail
house
i
took
my
examinations
i
qualified
as
a
dispensing
chemist
later
by
a
curious
piece
of
chance
i
met
your
mother
we
became
friends
she
was
the
first
person
in
whom
i
had
confided
since
i
left
mendip
she
seemed
to
understand
it
was
a
strange
thing
for
me
after
all
those
years
to
be
able
to
talk
about
myself
i
tell
you
what
a
wonderful
relief
it
was
and
then
we
found
that
we
loved
one
another
and
married
we
went
out
into
the
country
near
north
bromwich
to
find
a
village
to
make
a
home
in
and
we
came
across
halesby
the
place
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
now
twenty
years
ago
we
were
very
happy
i
talk
about
it
but
you
can
see
now
that
behind
your
life
there
were
quite
a
lot
of
complicated
things
that
appear
on
the
surface
really
better
that
you
should
know
makes
me
love
you
father
said
edwin
of
course
it
is
all
so
wonderful
i
expect
if
i
had
been
you
i
should
still
have
been
in
axcombe
i
think
i
could
have
done
what
you
might
have
done
a
great
deal
more
no
knowing
in
us
until
we
are
tried
that
sounds
like
samuel
smiles
but
quite
true
at
any
rate
time
we
were
asleep
boy
i
think
the
rain
has
they
said
and
edwin
kissed
his
father
but
for
several
hours
later
he
heard
the
clocks
of
bristol
chiming
in
a
little
time
he
knew
by
the
quiet
breathing
of
his
father
that
he
was
asleep
and
hearing
this
sound
and
thinking
of
the
grey
man
who
lay
beside
him
he
was
overwhelmed
with
an
emotion
in
which
pity
and
passionate
devotion
were
curiously
mingled
he
felt
strangely
protective
as
though
it
were
the
man
who
had
fought
such
a
hard
battle
who
was
weak
and
he
who
had
never
endured
anything
were
the
stronger
he
conceived
it
a
kind
of
sacred
duty
to
see
that
for
all
the
rest
of
his
life
his
father
should
never
suffer
any
pain
or
even
discomfort
from
which
he
could
protect
him
it
was
a
more
vivid
version
of
the
feeling
that
had
bowled
him
over
once
before
when
they
had
knelt
together
after
his
death
it
was
a
wholly
illogical
yet
when
he
came
to
think
it
over
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
something
of
the
same
kind
must
have
underlain
his
tenderness
towards
his
father
he
was
eager
to
persuade
himself
that
there
was
no
compassion
in
it
only
love
and
admiration
is
the
most
wonderful
man
in
the
world
he
thought
i
never
knew
remorse
overcame
him
when
he
remembered
that
once
at
he
had
been
ashamed
of
calling
there
be
another
chap
in
the
school
who
had
a
father
that
was
a
patch
on
him
he
remembered
a
more
recent
cause
for
shame
the
shiver
of
discomfort
that
the
revelation
of
his
uncle
occupation
had
given
him
he
had
thought
that
a
gardener
uncle
would
be
an
uncomfortable
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
of
a
fellow
of
balliol
instead
of
that
he
now
knew
that
he
should
have
been
proud
of
it
he
should
have
been
proud
of
anything
in
the
world
that
did
honour
to
his
father
everything
that
he
was
every
shred
of
culture
that
he
possessed
had
its
origin
in
the
devotion
and
the
sufferings
of
this
wonderful
man
and
whatever
happened
he
determined
that
he
would
be
worthy
of

the
hills
i
under
a
sky
of
blue
they
had
left
bristol
and
after
an
hour
of
hard
riding
came
to
an
easy
upland
plateau
where
the
road
lay
white
and
clear
before
them
so
clean
between
its
wide
margins
of
rough
turf
that
it
seemed
to
have
some
affinity
with
the
sky
on
their
way
they
had
met
few
people
but
the
carters
with
whom
they
had
exchanged
a
morning
greeting
were
all
smiling
and
friendly
very
different
from
the
surly
colliers
that
slouched
about
the
at
halesby
they
said
and
the
very
dialect
was
friendly
over
the
worst
of
the
road

ingleby
a
minute
or
two
we
shall
see
the
and
from
a
final
crest
the
road
suddenly
fell
steeply
through
the
scattered
buildings
of
a
hamlet
an
inn
with
a
wide
space
for
carts
to
turn
in
stood
on
a
sort
of
platform
at
the
side
of
the
highway
and
in
front
of
the
travellers
lay
the
mass
of
mendip
the
black
bow
of
axdown
with
its
shaggy
flanks
the
level
cliffs
of
callow
and
a
bold
seaward
spur
so
lost
in
watery
vapours
that
it
might
well
have
claimed
its
ancient
continuity
with
the
islands
that
swam
beyond
in
the
grey
sea
in
the
light
of
his
new
enthusiasm
edwin
found
it
more
impressive
than
any
scene
that
he
remembered
more
inspiring
though
less
vast
in
its
perspective
than
the
dreamy
plain
of
the
upper
waters
that
he
had
seen
so
many
times
from
uffdown
for
these
hills
were
very
mountains
and
mightier
in
that
they
rose
sheer
from
a
plain
that
had
been
bathed
in
water
within
the
memory
of
man
and
more
than
all
this
far
more
they
were
the
home
of
his
fathers
that
we
are
in
somerset
we
should
drink
the
wine
of
the
they
pushed
their
bicycles
on
to
the
platform
before
the
inn
door
and
ingleby
called
for
cider
a
pale
dry
liquid
with
a
faint
acridity
very
different
from
the
sugary
stuff
that
comes
to
the
cities
in
bottles
from
devonshire
good
cider
said
ingleby
tasting
does
it
come
from
he
asked
the
landlord
who
brought
it
do
be
a
tidy
drop

said
the
man
do
come
from

into

the
accusative

old

asked
his

the
landlord
laughed
the
gentleman
must
have
been
away
a
long
time
from
these
parts
atwell
had
been
dead
these
fifteen
years
the
same
said
ingleby
a
marvellous
archard
sure
said
the
landlord
last
year
was
a
wunnerful
year
for
apples
all
they
left
him
and
coasted
gently
down
the
hill
descending
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
the
dome
of
axdown
lost
some
of
its
mountainous
quality
and
by
the
time
that
they
had
reached
the
level
of
the
plain
in
which
wringford
lay
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
its
imminence
more
than
as
a
reminder
that
this
soft
green
country
was
not
wholly
devoted
to
quietude
and
sleep
but
that
a
cool
and
lively
air
must
always
be
rolling
from
the
hidden
slopes
they
came
to
a
green
bordered
by
elms
in
heavy
leaf
on
which
a
solitary
donkey
and
a
flock
of
geese
were
grazing
now
the
road
was
dead
level
and
the
hedges
rich
with
fragile
petals
and
thickets
of
that
were
not
yet
in
flower
superficially
the
road
might
have
been
part
of
warwickshire
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
midlands
in
the
air
that
moved
above
it
the
next
turn
to
the
right
shouted
ingleby
to
edwin
riding
ahead
in
the
middle
of
a
village
drenched
with
the
perfume
of
roses
edwin
turned
to
the
right
down
a
narrow
lane
by
this
time
his
father
had
reached
his
level
we
are
he
said
they
dismounted
it
was
a
small
cottage
with
a
porch
and
carefully
tended
garden
in
front
of
it
the
place
was
built
of
the
stone
of
the
country
and
washed
with
the
pinkish
lime
of
the
hills
in
the
garden
roses
and
bright
annuals
were
blooming
and
a
huge
acacia
hung
with
ivory
blossom
shadowed
the
garden
gate
on
the
gate
itself
edwin
read
a
crudely
painted
name
geranium
cottage
ingleby
smiled
uncle
will
is
very
fond
of
they
opened
the
gate
and
pushed
in
their
bicycles
everything
in
the
garden
was
so
meticulously
orderly
that
to
wheel
them
over
the
mown
grass
seemed
sacrilegious
the
porch
at
which
they
waited
was
full
of
choice
geraniums
their
hot
scent
filled
the
air
ingleby
knocked
gently
with
a
polished
brass
knocker
slow
steps
were
heard
within
moving
over
a
flagged
floor
the
door
was
opened
disclosing
a
stone
passage
that
smelt
of
coolness
and
cleanliness
it
was
like
the
smell
of
a
sweet
dairy
an
elderly
woman
with
a
plump
and
placid
face
and
grey
hair
received
them
all
her
figure
except
her
black
sateen
bodice
was
covered
with
a
coarse
but
snowy
apron
john
she
said
do
be
a
treat
to
see
she
took
ingleby
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
fellow
too
she
said
the
embrace
implied
more
than
any
of
the
condolences
that
edwin
had
heard
in
halesby
this
is
edwin
she
said
what
a
great
big
man
to
be
sure
she
proceeded
to
embrace
edwin
and
he
became
conscious
of
the
extraordinary
softness
and
coolness
of
her
face
in
and
make
yourselves
comfortable
said
aunt
sarah
jane
used
to
bicycles
in
this
house
our
joe
has
one
he
goes
to
work
on
it
every
day
and
sometimes
on
a
sunday
rides
over
to
clevedern
on
it
come
in
edwin
followed
his
father
into
the
it
was
clean
strikingly
clean
and
curiously
homely
on
the
walls
hung
a
picture
of
queen
victoria
looking
like
a
pouter
pigeon
in
her
jubilee
robes
and
another
of
the
sardonic
disraeli
there
were
several
padded
photograph
albums
with
gilt
clasps
and
other
photographs
decorated
the
mantelpiece
and
a
side
table
these
were
all
accommodated
in
fretwork
frames
do
keep
us
supplied
with
photograph
frames
said
aunt
sarah
jane
following
glances
with
a
touch
of
motherly
pride
like
his
father
clever
with
his
edwin
found
that
the
photographs
were
familiar
his
father
was
there
an
ardent
younger
father
with
black
whiskers
and
a
determined
mouth
a
father
confident
in
the
virtue
of
his
mother
too
in
a
costume
of
the
eighties
with
a
row
of
buttons
down
the
front
from
the
throat
to
the
hem
and
wonder
of
wonders
there
was
edwin
himself
in
a
sailor
suit
the
discovery
of
his
own
portrait
did
something
to
destroy
the
illusion
of
unreality
that
occupied
the
place
obviously
he
really
belonged
to
it
for
years
without
his
knowing
it
his
image
had
been
part
of
this
unfamiliar
room
even
though
he
had
not
known
of
their
existence
he
had
evidently
been
a
familiar
accepted
person
to
these
people
even
their
friends
must
have
known
him
by
sight
it
was
strange
it
was
pathetic
can
see
a
touch
of
our
joe
in
him
john
said
his
aunt
who
had
been
examining
him
closely
there
do
be
a
look
of
your
father
as
you
think
so
said
ingleby
a
great
boy
too
said
aunt
sarah
jane
lovingly
it
was
clear
enough
who
was
the
idol
of
this
household
now
your
dinner
will
be
spoiling
take
the
boy
upstairs
she
left
them
and
edwin
followed
his
father
up
a
crooked
stair
to
a
low
room
above
the
garden
a
cool
wind
was
blowing
down
from
axdown
and
the
filigree
shadow
of
the
lace
danced
on
the
white
coverlet
of
the
bed
the
room
smelt
faintly
of
lavender
it
seemed
to
edwin
a
wonderful
room
of
remember
the
and
health
and
quiet
there
was
nothing
quite
so
placid
as
this
in
the
life
that
he
had
known
they
washed
their
dusty
faces
and
came
downstairs
again
and
edwin
seated
by
the
sunny
window
of
the
front
room
relapsed
into
a
state
of
perfect
drowsiness
content
merely
to
exist
and
drink
in
the
sweet
and
simple
atmosphere
of
humble
content
this
he
supposed
was
what
his
father
by
his
struggles
and
sacrifices
had
lost
was
it
worth
while
the
complications
of
this
question
were
far
too
great
for
edwin
to
decide
the
men
folk
of
geranium
cottage
did
not
return
to
dinner
and
after
that
meal
in
which
suet
dumplings
played
an
important
part
edwin
retired
to
a
trellised
structure
at
the
back
of
the
garden
bowery
with
honeysuckle
that
aunt
sarah
jane
described
as
the
harbour
here
drugged
with
more
cider
and
fresh
air
he
dozed
away
the
early
afternoon
he
was
asleep
when
his
father
came
to
call
him
for
tea
after
all
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
was
sleepy
for
they
had
talked
into
the
small
hours
the
night
before
certainly
aunt
sarah
tea
was
worth
waking
up
for
quince
marmalade
and
clotted
cream
and
wheaten
scones
that
she
had
baked
that
morning
edwin
ready
now
for
any
further
revelations
would
not
now
have
been
shocked
to
hear
that
in
her
young
days
she
had
been
a
cook
in
this
beatific
state
of
refreshment
he
was
anxious
to
explore
are
we
going
to
highberrow
father
this
was
to
be
a
restful
holiday
ingleby
laughed
now
if
you
edwin
would
have
run
to
the
linhay
behind
the
house
for
the
bicycles
but
his
father
called
him
back
the
hill
was
so
steep
he
told
him
that
it
would
be
easier
for
them
to
walk
john
be
tarrable
disappointed
if
you
here
when
he
comes
home
from
work
said
aunt
sarah
jane
young
man
of
yours
do
go
too
fast
for
we
be
long
said
ingleby
and
so
they
set
off
together
for
highberrow
making
first
of
all
a
straight
line
for
the
base
of
the
hills
and
then
following
a
green
lane
that
skirted
the
foot
of
them
but
was
so
overshadowed
with
hazel
that
the
slopes
could
not
be
seen
in
a
mile
or
so
they
cut
into
the
main
road
again
by
an
iron
milestone
that
said
bristol
the
road
climbed
along
a
quarried
terrace
in
the
and
to
the
left
of
it
lay
a
deep
valley
on
the
farther
slope
of
which
lay
half
a
dozen
cottages
with
gardens
falling
to
the
bed
of
an
attenuated
stream
and
behind
the
cottages
a
steep
rose
abruptly
to
a
bare
height
crowned
with
ancient
earthworks
said
ingleby
silbury
camp
an
old
rhyme
about
it
it
is
supposed
to
be
full
of
buried
gold
when
i
was
a
boy
i
often
used
to
lie
up
there
in
the
sun
gazing
out
over
the
channel
in
spring
all
the
meadows
between
the
camp
and
highberrow
batch
are
full
of
daffodils
i
often
used
to
wish
there
were
daffodils
in
halesby
in
a
little
while
they
came
to
the
church
of
highberrow
placed
like
a
on
the
edge
of
the
batch
surveying
the
immense
relics
of
paganism
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
it
was
a
humble
and
not
very
beautiful
building
but
edwin
entered
the
churchyard
with
awe
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
so
much
of
the
past
that
had
made
him
lay
buried
there
and
the
inscriptions
on
the
tombstones
reinforced
this
idea
for
the
churchyard
was
veritably
crowded
with
the
remains
of
dead
inglebys
it
made
the
past
a
piece
of
knowledge
so
recent
to
him
that
it
still
held
an
atmosphere
of
unreality
and
phantasy
so
ponderable
that
in
comparison
with
it
his
present
condition
seemed
almost
unreal
his
father
led
him
through
the
long
grass
starry
with
yellow
ragwort
to
the
corner
in
which
his
grandmother
was
buried
is
the
place
that
i
told
you
about
he
said
place
where
my
grandfather
went
out
at
night
and
blasted
the
rock
it
was
incredible
until
that
moment
the
story
had
been
only
a
legend
edwin
wondered
how
ever
his
father
could
have
broken
away
from
the
tradition
of
centuries
and
left
the
hills
the
roots
of
their
family
had
pierced
so
deeply
into
the
soil
yes
even
beneath
the
soil
and
into
the
veins
of
the
solid
rock
the
conditions
of
his
own
life
seemed
to
him
the
tokens
of
an
unnatural
and
artificial
thing
they
left
the
churchyard
by
a
narrow
lane
that
always
climbed
they
passed
the
village
inn
a
long
windswept
building
so
bare
and
so
exposed
to
weather
that
even
the
tenure
of
the
lichen
on
the
tiles
seemed
precarious
over
the
lintel
a
weathered
board
showed
them
the
name
of
ingleby
in
faded
letters
edwin
pointed
to
it
said
his
father
suppose
he
is
some
remote
cousin
of
yours
everybody
that
is
left
in
this
village
must
be
related
to
us
in
some
degree
though
i
suppose
any
of
them
would
remember
me
you
see
i
went
to
axcombe
when
i
was
a
good
deal
younger
than
he
smiled
am
like
a
ghost
returning
to
its
old
home
like
a
ghost
and
yet
to
edwin
the
whole
place
seemed
familiar
he
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
when
opposite
a
windy
in
front
of
which
the
dry
blades
of
a
dishevelled
dracæna
shivered
as
though
protesting
against
its
wintry
exile
his
father
turned
off
to
the
left
along
a
road
that
had
once
been
gay
with
cottage
gardens
and
trim
buildings
of
stone
but
was
now
suggestive
of
nothing
but
ruin
and
desolation
by
one
of
these
pathetic
ruins
his
father
paused
was
your
house
eddie
it
was
here
that
i
was
now
there
remained
only
the
of
a
house
and
the
only
sign
of
habitation
in
all
the
ruin
was
to
be
seen
in
the
stones
of
the
chimney
the
garden
indeed
lay
beautiful
in
decay
for
there
as
everywhere
in
this
deserted
countryside
the
golden
ragwort
had
taken
possession
but
within
the
walls
of
the
house
only
nettles
shivered
always
find
nettles
in
deserted
human
habitations
i
know
why
said
ingleby
is
a
rather
unusual
botanical
curiosity
to
be
found
among
the
workings
at
cold
harbour
he
went
on
roman
nettle
urtica
my
memory
what
it
used
to
be
it
has
a
bigger
leaf
than
the
ordinary
nettle
and
a
much
more
poisonous
sting
only
found
in
places
where
the
romans
have
why
in
the
face
of
this
harrowing
desolation
should
he
be
thinking
of
things
like
that
a
ghost
with
as
little
passion
or
feeling
as
a
ghost
emotions
so
different
from
the
passionate
resentment
that
now
filled
heart
here
is
the
school
i
suppose
they
pull
that
down
i
remember
when
it
was
newly
built
it
was
there
that
i
learnt
my
alphabet
in
the
whole
of
the
lane
the
school
was
the
only
whole
building
you
come
to
the
edge
of
the
batch
you
will
see
the
valley
bottom
where
i
spent
my
childhood
with
your
they
passed
on
and
saw
a
hundred
feet
beneath
them
the
valley
of
the
little
stream
more
ruins
many
of
them
but
one
or
two
cottages
still
inhabited
the
lower
cottages
lay
close
to
the
water
and
in
four
or
five
places
the
stream
was
spanned
by
a
clapper
bridge
in
one
of
the
gardens
ghostly
children
were
playing
and
in
another
ghostly
washing
flapped
in
a
breeze
that
had
risen
with
the
coolness
of
evening
ingleby
pointed
out
to
edwin
his
home
it
was
the
cottage
in
the
garden
of
which
the
children
were
playing
from
the
chimney
a
trail
of
smoke
dwindled
up
against
the
grey
should
like
to
see
inside
it
said
edwin
you
no
i
think
it
would
be
worth
going
down
into
the
hollow
to
see
it
only
be
disappointed
i
expect
be
anything
much
to
see
besides
we
time
i
want
to
take
you
to
a
little
really
big
enough
to
be
called
a
the
top
of
the
lane
under
axdown
they
call
it
the
holloway
why
i
imagine
for
it
is
the
highest
point
of
the
whole
village
your
aunt
tells
me
that
your
sister
your
own
lydia
is
still
living
there
and
i
think
i
had
better
go
and
see
he
turned
again
and
edwin
followed
him
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
his
father
should
not
be
anxious
to
look
inside
the
house
where
his
childhood
had
been
spent
a
ghost
a
they
passed
the
windy
farm
once
more
a
man
in
muddy
gaiters
was
driving
cows
into
the
yard
he
was
the
first
from
the
ghostly
children
in
the
they
had
seen
a
tall
man
with
a
gaunt
grey
face
who
did
not
even
turn
to
look
at
them
or
give
them
although
they
must
surely
have
been
the
only
living
people
that
he
had
seen
that
day
it
was
impossible
to
believe
from
the
sight
of
its
exterior
that
the
farm
was
now
inhabited
do
you
think
he
is
edwin
asked
know
i
the
least
idea
the
people
at
that
farm
used
to
be
named
ingleby
and
he
certainly
has
the
figure
of
your
grandfather
you
stop
and
speak
to
him
should
we
he
would
be
awfully
pleased
to
see
you
and
know
who
you
are
expect
he
a
moment
later
ingleby
said
the
ruins
of
this
cottage
ought
to
interest
you
is
it
one
of
ours
but
the
old
woman
who
lived
in
it
in
my
day
was
always
supposed
to
be
a
witch
mendip
people
were
always
great
believers
in
witchcraft
i
wonder
if
your
aunt
believes
in
to
this
day
i
suppose
she
was
really
a
harmless
old
body
the
story
was
that
a
daughter
of
hers
with
whom
she
had
quarrelled
married
a
small
dairy
farmer
down
by
axcombe
and
no
sooner
had
she
gone
to
live
with
him
than
the
poor
cows
went
dry
his
business
failed
he
had
to
sell
his
stock
he
was
ruined
and
took
to
drink
and
in
all
the
for
miles
round
he
used
to
rail
against
his
and
say
that
she
was
responsible
for
the
whole
business
she
was
a
lonely
old
creature
very
poor
and
dirty
and
when
we
were
children
and
going
up
to
the
holloway
we
used
to
cover
our
eyes
and
run
for
fear
we
should
catch
sight
of
her
no
one
even
knew
when
she
died
they
found
her
i
heard
when
she
had
been
dead
for
a
week
or
ten
edwin
shivered
these
it
seemed
were
hard
and
cruel
no
doubt
he
must
have
some
of
their
stony
cruelty
in
his
own
being
somewhere
at
last
they
reached
the
farm
at
the
top
of
the
holloway
it
was
a
poor
building
only
a
little
more
hospitable
than
the
ruins
in
the
valley
ingleby
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
sturdy
man
with
an
iron
hook
in
place
of
his
right
hand
lifted
the
latch
and
stared
at
them
know
me
isaac
said
ingleby
i
say
i
do
know
john
ingleby
well
and
proud
to
see
john
do
step
inside
and
see
mother
i
shake
hands
with
the
way
i
was
used
to
i
lost
en
in
a
five
years
back
come
in
he
led
the
way
into
a
dark
cabin
everything
in
it
was
dark
partly
perhaps
because
the
windows
were
full
of
partly
because
all
the
furniture
was
darkened
with
age
or
smoke
or
grime
the
only
bright
colours
in
its
brownness
were
a
number
of
shining
copper
utensils
and
a
fine
show
of
geraniums
in
the
window
isaac
followed
eyes
towards
these
flowers
they
he
said
with
pride
brother
will
sent
mother
in
the
gloom
of
the
fireplace
where
a
pile
of
turves
smouldered
mother
began
to
dissociate
herself
from
the
surrounding
brownness
she
was
a
very
old
woman
edwin
had
never
seen
any
one
so
bolt
upright
in
a
oaken
chair
her
face
seemed
to
edwin
very
beautiful
for
extreme
age
had
taken
from
it
all
the
extraneous
charm
that
smoothness
and
colour
give
leaving
only
the
sheer
chiselled
beauty
of
feature
it
was
a
noble
face
finely
modelled
with
a
straight
nose
a
tender
mouth
and
level
brows
beneath
which
burned
the
darkest
and
clearest
eyes
that
edwin
had
ever
seen
her
hair
was
white
and
scanty
but
little
of
it
was
seen
beneath
the
white
bonnet
that
she
wore
edwin
felt
her
eyes
go
through
him
in
the
gloom
cousin
john
come
to
see
mother
said
isaac
bending
over
her
what
john
said
the
old
lady
it
struck
edwin
at
once
that
her
speech
was
purer
and
more
delicate
than
that
of
her
son
ingleby
aunt
lydia
said
father
need
not
raise
your
voice
my
dear
she
said
sight
and
my
hearing
are
wonderful
thank
you
remember
me
aunt
lydia
course
i
remember
you
john
though
many
and
many
years
since
my
eyes
saw
you
and
how
are
you
my
dear
they
tell
me
that
you
have
done
great
things
in
the
world
a
doctor
like
poor
not
a
doctor
in
business
a
knew
it
was
something
of
the
kind
you
speak
so
loud
and
they
told
me
you
had
married
i
suppose
this
is
your
boy
a
fine
boy
surely
he
has
a
look
of
your
this
is
remember
that
name
in
our
family
it
sounds
like
a
fanciful
name
come
here
my
dear
and
let
me
look
at
edwin
went
to
her
and
she
kissed
him
her
face
was
so
cold
and
smooth
that
she
might
almost
have
been
dead
how
is
your
dear
wife
john
had
a
terrible
blow
aunt
lydia
lost
that
was
bad
for
you
and
bad
for
the
boy
shall
never
get
over
voice
trembled
of
course
you
say
that
natural
that
you
should
young
but
when
you
live
to
be
as
old
as
i
am
know
better
you
will
get
over
it
when
a
few
years
have
gone
by
marry
aunt
lydia
what
you
feel
now
but
i
know
the
family
the
inglebys
are
always
very
tender
in
marriage
seen
many
of
them
that
have
lost
their
wives
and
they
always
marry
again
i
suppose
that
i
shall
live
to
hear
of
it
but
when
the
time
comes
remember
what
i
aunt
lydia
is
a
wonderful
thing
john
glad
to
have
seen
you
and
your
boy
i
hope
take
after
were
always
the
best
of
she
gave
a
little
sigh
evidently
she
was
tired
the
flame
that
burned
behind
her
black
eyes
was
so
very
feeble
for
all
its
brightness
isaac
who
had
been
watching
her
with
the
devotion
of
a
practised
nurse
saw
that
she
could
not
stand
any
more
talking
mother
enough
my
dear
he
said
me
john
she
said
and
ingleby
kissed
her
now
that
you
be
here
after
all
these
years
said
isaac
cheerily
as
he
rearranged
the
red
shawl
round
his
shoulders
leave
us
without
taking
something
there
do
be
a
lovely
bit
of
bacon
i
have
cut
do
try
a
bit
now
and
a
mug
of
edwin
who
was
already
hungry
with
his
walk
and
was
rapidly
acquiring
a
taste
for
the
wine
of
the
country
now
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
dark
ceiling
was
decked
with
sides
of
bacon
and
hams
that
hung
there
slowly
pickling
in
the
turf
smoke
that
saturated
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
he
was
disappointed
when
his
father
declined
to
take
any
of
this
delicacy
a
mug
of
cider
then
isaac
persisted
he
went
into
an
inner
chamber
down
three
stone
steps
with
three
china
mugs
hanging
on
his
hook
see
i
do
be
pretty
handy
with
en
he
laughed
they
drank
their
cider
solemnly
it
was
even
drier
than
that
which
they
had
drunk
for
lunch
at
wringford
and
so
free
from
acidity
that
all
that
edwin
could
taste
was
that
faint
astringent
bitterness
it
had
also
a
bouquet
that
was
less
like
the
odour
of
apples
than
that
of
a
a
wonderful
they
said
and
isaac
who
seemed
to
edwin
the
most
kindly
and
patient
creature
he
had
ever
met
showed
them
to
the
door
by
this
time
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
cool
wind
from
the
west
had
freshened
edwin
saw
for
the
first
time
the
huge
panorama
on
which
they
had
turned
their
backs
as
they
climbed
the
hill
to
the
holloway
perhaps
it
was
the
strangeness
of
all
his
recent
experience
perhaps
partly
the
exhilaration
that
proceeded
from
cider
but
the
sight
struck
edwin
as
one
of
greater
magnificence
than
any
he
had
ever
seen
before
from
their
feet
the
whole
country
sloped
in
a
series
of
hilly
waves
to
the
shores
of
the
channel
and
that
muddy
sea
now
shone
from
coast
to
coast
in
a
blaze
of
tawny
light
now
truly
for
the
first
time
one
of
the
gateways
of
the
world
and
beyond
the
channel
stood
the
heaped
mountains
of
wales
very
wild
and
black
in
their
vastness
the
sight
was
so
impressive
that
on
their
way
down
the
lane
they
did
not
speak
at
last
edwin
said
think
aunt
lydia
has
a
very
beautiful
face
she
looks
like
some
old
grand
is
very
like
your
grandfather
said
his
father
must
be
over
ninety
it
is
a
great
and
on
the
way
home
edwin
began
to
imagine
what
his
strange
grandfather
the
dowser
must
have
been
with
the
figure
of
the
lonely
farmer
his
black
beard
and
hair
and
his
noble
features
and
piercing
eyes
ii
they
stayed
for
a
week
at
geranium
cottage
sinking
without
any
effort
into
its
placid
life
edwin
was
content
merely
to
live
there
soaking
up
the
atmosphere
of
wringford
village
and
only
thinking
of
highberrow
as
a
strange
and
ghostly
adventure
possible
but
too
disturbing
to
be
indulged
in
the
tiredness
of
ingleby
who
never
showed
the
least
inclination
to
revisit
the
place
made
this
abstention
easier
in
the
whole
of
his
week
at
wringford
edwin
only
made
one
attempt
to
see
highberrow
again
the
impulse
came
to
him
very
early
one
morning
just
at
the
hour
of
dawn
when
the
birds
had
fallen
to
silence
and
joe
who
happened
to
be
working
for
his
master
at
a
village
some
miles
away
was
splashing
about
under
the
pump
in
the
yard
at
the
back
of
the
linhay
ingleby
was
still
asleep
and
edwin
dressing
quietly
stole
downstairs
and
set
off
towards
the
hills
this
time
on
his
bicycle
he
followed
the
high
road
and
left
the
machine
in
a
quarry
opposite
the
point
where
the
first
cottages
appeared
by
this
time
he
was
almost
sorry
that
he
had
come
there
for
he
was
quite
certain
that
the
village
he
was
now
going
to
visit
would
be
a
very
different
place
from
the
dead
or
hallucinated
highberrow
that
he
and
his
father
had
penetrated
some
days
before
he
felt
this
so
strongly
that
he
take
the
risk
of
spoiling
that
marvellous
impression
and
instead
of
following
the
road
that
they
had
taken
before
he
changed
his
mind
crossed
the
valley
of
the
pink
cottages
and
climbed
the
shaley
slope
of
silbury
in
the
fosse
that
surrounded
the
encampment
a
hundred
white
tails
bobbed
at
once
and
laughing
he
scrambled
up
the
sides
of
what
had
once
been
silbury
camp
and
now
was
silbury
warren
here
lying
full
length
upon
the
top
of
the
vallum
as
perhaps
a
belgic
ancestor
or
an
ancestor
who
held
the
crest
before
the
belgæ
came
had
lain
before
him
he
could
look
over
the
combe
towards
the
church
of
highberrow
on
the
batch
and
the
church
tower
was
all
he
saw
of
highberrow
again
a
feature
most
unrepresentative
of
the
spirit
of
that
pagan
place
even
the
church
tower
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
could
scarcely
be
seen
for
mist
and
all
the
time
cold
mist
was
pouring
down
in
a
dense
impalpable
stream
from
the
milky
coverlet
that
spread
upon
axdown
and
callow
and
all
the
hills
beyond
in
the
plain
nothing
could
be
seen
at
first
and
from
the
sleeping
villages
no
sound
was
heard
but
by
degrees
the
pattern
of
the
surface
with
its
dappled
orchards
its
green
pasturage
and
paler
cut
by
the
straight
bands
of
the
rhines
the
sluggish
channels
through
which
the
surface
water
drained
into
the
sea
became
more
clear
and
with
this
the
sounds
of
the
country
grew
more
distinct
indefinite
noises
such
as
the
creaking
of
in
a
hidden
lane
the
squeak
of
a
at
the
back
of
the
pink
cottages
the
clink
of
a
pick
in
the
quarry
the
whole
world
awoke
and
edwin
too
found
that
he
was
awake
and
awfully
hungry
he
scrambled
down
the
slope
smoke
was
now
rising
from
the
chimneys
of
the
cottages
in
the
combe
he
was
back
at
wringford
in
time
for
breakfast
by
this
time
he
had
begun
to
feel
quite
at
home
in
geranium
cottage
he
had
made
the
discovery
of
his
cousin
and
his
uncle
will
the
latter
he
found
wholly
lovable
a
creature
of
slow
quiet
speech
as
leisurely
and
peaceful
as
his
vocation
and
full
of
small
kindnesses
that
surprised
by
reason
of
their
unexpectedness
the
thing
that
most
impressed
edwin
in
his
nature
was
the
extraordinary
tenderness
he
showed
towards
the
green
things
that
were
his
care
perhaps
the
custom
of
dispensing
with
the
neuter
pronoun
and
speaking
of
all
inanimate
creatures
as
if
they
were
persons
made
his
solicitude
for
their
welfare
more
noticeable
but
he
was
not
only
kind
to
them
in
his
speech
his
short
and
fingers
that
seemed
to
be
built
for
nothing
but
the
roughest
of
labour
became
amazingly
sensitive
and
delicate
as
soon
as
he
began
to
handle
the
plants
in
his
garden
so
that
every
touch
had
in
it
the
nature
of
a
caress
in
this
life
of
the
devoted
husbandman
he
was
evidently
wholly
contented
and
he
made
it
seem
to
edwin
the
most
natural
and
human
on
earth
the
fascination
of
watching
his
hands
grew
upon
him
and
in
the
end
he
would
watch
the
man
who
had
been
busy
at
the
same
work
in
his
garden
all
day
tending
his
own
favourites
at
home
until
the
light
began
to
fail
and
aunt
sarah
jane
would
call
the
two
of
them
in
to
supper
the
spectacle
had
a
sort
of
hypnotic
effect
upon
the
boy
it
was
so
slow
and
measured
as
slow
almost
edwin
thought
as
the
processes
of
germination
and
growth
which
it
was
his
vocation
to
assist
his
fingers
even
handled
the
purple
soil
as
if
he
loved
it
his
cousin
was
a
different
matter
altogether
a
tall
boy
a
couple
of
years
older
than
edwin
he
had
much
more
distinctly
than
uncle
will
the
ingleby
face
the
features
that
were
to
be
seen
at
their
best
in
the
old
lady
at
the
holloway
farm
and
he
possessed
in
a
high
degree
the
quality
that
had
carried
father
out
into
the
world
a
seriousness
that
made
him
anxious
to
on
promptings
of
which
were
now
being
satisfied
in
an
accumulation
of
the
periodical
publications
that
have
taken
the
place
of
samuel
smiles
in
these
days
weeklies
devoted
to
all
kinds
of
useful
series
that
eventually
culminated
in
the
gigantic
illusion
of
the
to
these
short
cuts
to
power
the
young
man
devoted
all
his
evenings
and
though
he
was
quite
natural
in
his
anxiousness
to
be
friendly
with
edwin
with
whose
subtler
and
more
contemplative
nature
he
had
at
present
so
little
in
common
the
attempts
were
not
very
successful
between
these
two
there
lay
a
far
more
obvious
gulf
than
that
which
separated
edwin
from
the
older
people
in
a
way
he
could
not
help
admiring
his
earnestness
probably
because
he
knew
that
he
could
never
imitate
it
and
yet
he
sometimes
found
himself
examining
it
in
a
mood
of
absolute
detachment
that
made
his
sympathy
feel
artificial
just
before
he
left
he
had
been
reading
of
and
in
the
light
of
this
work
the
efforts
of
his
father
followed
by
those
of
his
cousin
joe
seemed
to
him
an
excellent
instance
of
the
tendency
of
ancient
stocks
to
vary
or
sport
in
definite
directions
in
the
earnest
joe
edwin
found
the
phenomenon
a
little
troublesome
for
the
sight
of
the
immense
energies
that
the
youth
was
putting
into
channels
that
were
futile
distressed
him
and
the
more
so
because
to
correct
the
waste
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
begin
again
from
a
point
so
distant
that
joe
would
be
faced
with
the
spectacle
of
more
than
half
of
his
present
energies
wasted
so
edwin
thought
as
little
as
the
consciousness
of
his
own
selfishness
would
allow
him
of
all
the
labours
that
were
typified
by
the
fretwork
mahogany
frames
that
surrounded
the
photographs
of
the
halesby
inglebys
listening
instead
to
the
endless
tales
of
his
aunt
sarah
jane
in
the
hour
when
she
became
talkative
after
supper
by
this
time
edwin
was
so
interested
in
his
own
romantic
origins
that
any
story
of
the
old
highberrow
would
do
for
him
and
his
aunt
with
her
soft
somerset
voice
her
picturesque
phrasing
and
her
unfailing
memory
for
social
details
rebuilt
night
after
night
the
life
of
the
decayed
village
as
it
had
been
in
the
old
time
evolving
by
degrees
a
human
comedy
which
resembled
that
of
its
great
exemplar
by
the
way
in
which
the
protagonists
of
one
episode
became
mere
incidentals
to
another
edwin
knew
them
all
by
name
and
recognised
them
as
if
he
had
met
them
in
the
flesh
whenever
he
heard
of
them
in
this
way
sitting
in
the
smell
of
the
window
geraniums
over
a
leisurely
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
in
his
case
literally
washed
down
with
cider
he
heard
a
story
that
he
always
remembered
with
pride
and
pity
and
a
degree
of
passionate
resentment
the
story
of
how
the
village
of
his
fathers
had
sunk
into
decay
highberrow
it
appeared
had
been
built
on
what
was
then
a
common
moorland
by
the
men
who
lived
in
it
laboriously
stone
by
stone
their
right
to
these
fruits
of
their
labour
had
never
been
called
into
question
and
the
whole
spirit
of
the
village
had
been
happy
and
prosperous
as
well
it
might
seeing
that
it
owed
nothing
to
the
care
of
any
outsider
and
could
pay
its
way
and
during
those
prosperous
times
its
liberties
seemed
secure
from
danger
but
when
the
decay
of
the
industry
led
to
unemployment
and
poverty
and
the
younger
men
of
the
highberrow
families
began
to
look
for
their
living
overseas
the
little
community
became
so
weak
that
the
owner
of
the
saw
his
opportunity
as
lord
of
the
manor
he
disputed
the
of
the
highberrow
villagers
and
through
his
agents
demanded
a
rent
that
would
have
made
living
impossible
for
most
of
them
for
the
cottages
that
they
or
their
forefathers
had
built
if
they
refused
to
pay
the
rent
he
said
they
would
be
evicted
not
in
order
that
other
people
might
be
introduced
who
would
pay
but
merely
to
satisfy
the
convictions
of
the
rightness
of
his
principle
that
was
the
way
in
which
he
put
it
merely
out
of
spite
would
be
a
more
accurate
description
of
his
motives
highberrow
was
in
a
bad
way
the
villagers
were
either
very
old
or
very
young
and
in
either
case
their
feebleness
made
the
whole
organism
unfit
to
resist
the
inroads
of
the
parasite
what
is
more
they
were
very
poor
and
the
very
nature
of
the
mendip
mining
industry
had
made
them
so
far
individualist
that
the
idea
of
combined
resistance
did
not
occur
to
them
the
landlord
wisely
started
his
operations
with
an
old
woman
whose
cottage
lay
nearest
to
the
woods
in
which
his
pheasants
were
bred
almost
incredibly
poor
she
had
lived
on
the
products
of
her
garden
and
her
poultry
to
pay
rent
was
out
of
the
question
sheer
age
and
inertia
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
move
and
in
the
course
of
time
she
was
evicted
with
her
miserable
belongings
and
went
to
die
at
the
home
of
a
married
daughter
emerging
from
this
easy
contest
the
landlord
or
perhaps
his
agent
moved
on
to
the
next
it
was
unfortunate
for
him
and
fortunate
for
the
villagers
that
he
now
pitched
on
the
cottage
of
thomas
ingleby
the
dowser
grandfather
the
old
man
had
this
in
his
favour
that
he
was
a
man
of
two
trades
that
even
when
the
mining
had
failed
him
he
could
make
a
living
with
the
divining
rod
and
the
consciousness
of
this
power
no
doubt
stiffened
his
resistance
another
eviction
was
decreed
but
this
time
things
did
not
go
so
easily
when
the
men
arrived
from
the
manor
to
empty
the
house
another
party
appeared
from
the
cold
harbour
mines
and
as
soon
as
the
furniture
was
dragged
out
at
the
front
door
it
was
seized
and
taken
in
again
at
the
back
were
a
proper
said
uncle
will
quietly
do
remember
it
well
i
can
see
your
father
now
john
standing
over
beyond
the
road
with
his
back
to
the
wall
not
a
word
just
of
his
the
men
saw
that
this
sort
of
thing
might
go
on
for
ever
and
none
the
better
for
it
so
they
just
gave
it
up
but
old
ingleby
edwin
had
already
canonised
him
as
a
had
shown
the
rest
of
the
highberrow
people
what
could
be
done
and
gradually
stirred
them
into
combined
action
it
was
a
little
pitiful
attempt
he
himself
put
into
it
all
his
savings
a
matter
of
a
few
pounds
and
to
this
were
added
as
many
shillings
as
could
be
scraped
together
in
the
village
he
took
the
money
to
a
lawyer
in
was
his
honest
man
with
a
sense
of
justice
and
one
suspects
some
admiration
for
the
sturdiness
of
his
client
bayliss
worked
the
matter
up
and
made
a
case
of
it
and
no
further
attempts
at
eviction
were
made
in
highberrow
in
the
meantime
the
village
even
regained
a
little
of
its
former
confidence
and
for
some
time
the
landlord
did
not
show
his
face
in
it
but
once
more
luck
was
against
highberrow
bayliss
the
good
lawyer
died
he
had
been
careful
to
keep
the
matter
in
his
own
hands
and
when
it
came
to
be
considered
by
his
successor
a
partner
with
social
ambitions
the
new
man
would
not
touch
it
partly
because
there
appeared
to
be
no
more
money
in
it
as
was
probably
the
case
and
partly
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
meeting
the
lord
of
the
manor
in
the
and
was
on
terms
with
the
agent
there
followed
an
exodus
of
despair
the
people
of
highberrow
who
had
no
more
money
to
fight
with
packed
up
their
pitiable
belongings
and
left
their
houses
rather
than
face
the
trouble
of
eviction
not
so
thomas
ingleby
the
agent
returned
to
the
attack
there
were
threats
a
stormy
interview
in
which
the
dowser
faced
the
landlord
himself
a
final
notice
was
given
and
ingleby
made
sure
once
more
of
the
support
of
his
friends
from
the
neighbouring
villages
but
no
further
attempt
at
eviction
was
made
at
the
last
moment
the
landlord
climbed
down
he
arranged
another
interview
and
at
this
the
terms
for
the
whole
village
were
settled
for
the
lives
of
the
present
occupants
or
for
a
period
of
sixty
years
the
cottages
should
remain
it
was
not
everything
but
a
famous
victory
is
why
aunt
lydia
do
be
still
living
up
to
the
holloway
to
this
day
said
aunt
sarah
jane
i
suppose
grandfather
lived
there
till
he
died
said
edwin
the
poor
dear
when
he
did
grow
very
aged
your
uncle
and
i
went
up
to
highberrow
and
persuaded
en
that
he
fit
to
look
after
himself
you
should
seed
the
dirt
in
that
house
and
he
comed
down
to
live
along
of
we
but
he
were
never
happy
were
he
will
he
were
never
were
a
quare
old
man

seed
very
little
of
en
arften
people
would
come
for
en
from
a
distance
that
wanted
water
found
and
he
did
spend
the
day
roving
the
country
cutting
blackthorns
for
his
dowsing
right
up
to
the
day
when
he
took
to
his
bed
poor
should
like
to
have
seen
him
dowsing
said
edwin
even
seen
the
twigs
that
they
that
would
have
been
easy
enough
only
the
other
day
i
throwed
out
a
lot
that
belonged
to
your
edwin
blushed
at
this
sacrilege
could
uncle
will
find
water
with
a
twig
he
asked
i
laughed
his
uncle
they
do
say
it
runs
in
families
have
you
ever
tried
john
tried
when
i
was
a
boy
said
ingleby
nothing
expect
our
joe
could
said
aunt
sarah
jane
with
infinite
faith
in
her
offspring
mother
tried
it
said
joe
from
the
lamplit
corner
where
he
was
wrestling
with
the
science
of
sanitary
inspection
wonder
if
i
could
said
edwin
you
shall
have
a
try
laughed
his
uncle
this
time
night
said
aunt
sarah
jane
scandalised
the
boy
have
a
try
said
uncle
will
rising
a
beautivul
moonlight
night
and
take
him
over
the
field
where
the
new
mad
the
two
of
you
said
his
aunt
with
a
sigh
edwin
and
his
uncle
went
out
into
the
garden
and
there
the
boy
watched
the
clumsy
skilful
hands
cut
a
forked
twig
from
a
blackthorn
bush
do
work
as
well
he
said
father
always
used
the
then
they
went
out
together
over
a
dewy
meadow
and
his
uncle
showed
him
how
to
hold
the
rod
with
his
two
hands
turned
palm
upwards
the
arms
of
the
twig
between
the
third
and
fourth
fingers
the
thumb
and
the
palm
of
each
hand
and
the
fork
downwards
between
them
over
the
meadow
grass
they
walked
slowly
then
suddenly
the
tip
of
the
rod
began
to
turn
upwards
by
no
agency
of
which
edwin
was
aware
it
was
very
thrilling
for
his
hands
were
quite
still
you
are
said
his
uncle
a
found
our
the
rod
down
uncle
edwin
said
he
did
so
and
now
the
mysterious
force
was
so
strong
that
the
arms
of
the
twig
snapped
gone
and
broke
it
said
uncle
will
in
or
catch
they
went
in
together
said
ingleby
a
proper
dowser
sure
enough
said
uncle
will
edwin
was
still
curiously
thrilled
with
the
whole
business
he
felt
that
a
little
more
excitement
in
his
attainment
was
due
to
him
but
no
one
not
even
his
father
seemed
in
the
least
impressed
it
comforted
him
to
think
that
his
cousin
joe
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
book
in
the
corner
had
really
less
in
common
than
himself
with
the
strange
dark
people
from
whom
they
were
both
descended
it
was
better
he
thought
to
be
a
born
dowser
than
a
fellow
of
balliol
more
wonderful
still
to
be
both
all
the
rest
of
that
evening
he
felt
a
queer
elation
in
his
mysterious
birthright
and
when
his
father
yawned
and
they
both
went
up
to
bed
he
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
listening
to
the
drowsy
music
of
the
corncrake
and
the
wail
of
hunting
owls
trying
to
put
himself
more
closely
in
touch
with
the
romantic
past
that
had
bred
him
with
that
magnificent
figure
his
grandfather
and
the
innumerable
strange
and
passionate
ancestry
that
slept
under
the
shadow
of
highberrow
church
on
the
batch
i
have
a
goodly
heritage
he
thought
and
so
he
came
to
think
of
his
father
through
whom
these
things
came
to
him
of
his
hard
achievements
of
his
loneliness
of
his
difficulty
of
it
were
not
a
disinclination
to
the
powerful
and
stormy
things
that
must
lie
hidden
in
his
heart
and
a
feeling
of
passionate
kinship
carried
edwin
away
an
anxiety
to
show
his
love
for
his
father
in
unmistakable
ways
to
make
clear
to
him
once
and
for
all
the
depth
of
his
devotion
he
began
to
think
of
his
father
as
a
mother
might
think
of
her
child
it
must
have
been
in
that
way
he
imagined
that
his
own
mother
had
thought
of
her
husband
the
night
was
so
still
that
he
imagined
he
could
hear
the
rusty
ivory
of
the
falling
at
the
gate
iii
they
were
in
the
train
on
their
way
home
from
bristol
passing
smoothly
under
the
escarpment
of
the
lower
cotswolds
the
fortnight
had
passed
with
an
astounding
swiftness
after
leaving
wringford
they
had
cycled
over
the
back
of
mendip
past
the
mines
at
cold
harbour
where
they
had
paused
for
half
an
hour
to
look
at
the
workings
now
deserted
and
overgrown
with
ragwort
and
scabious
and
the
roman
amphitheatre
to
the
great
limestone
gorge
above
axcombe
and
from
there
they
had
ridden
to
wells
where
beyond
streets
that
flowed
eternally
with
limpid
water
they
had
gazed
on
the
wonder
of
the
cathedral
and
seen
the
white
swans
floating
in
the
palace
moat
under
a
sky
that
was
full
of
peace
only
for
a
moment
had
they
seen
the
masts
of
bristol
and
dreamy
spire
and
now
in
a
few
hours
they
would
be
back
in
halesby
in
another
world
as
they
travelled
northwards
edwin
was
thinking
all
the
time
of
the
work
that
he
would
do
in
his
little
room
above
the
bed
of
stocks
it
should
be
a
fragrant
room
he
thought
and
a
good
one
for
reading
for
when
his
attention
wandered
he
would
be
able
to
lift
his
eyes
to
a
line
of
gentler
hills
crowned
by
the
dark
folds
of
hanging
woods
and
there
he
would
be
able
to
dream
of
the
coloured
past
and
of
his
own
exciting
future
and
the
enchanted
life
that
he
would
soon
be
leading
among
the
noblest
works
of
men
in
letters
and
in
stone
oxford
his
mecca
the
eternal
city
of
his
dreams
he
allowed
his
fancy
to
travel
westward
over
the
rolling
cotswold
and
droop
by
the
slow
descent
of
river
valleys
to
that
sacred
place
his
voice
dispelled
his
dream
they
were
alone
in
the
carriage
and
their
privacy
made
speaking
easy
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
your
father
been
thinking
it
over
in
my
own
mind
i
talked
it
over
a
week
or
two
ago
with
your
uncle
albert
a
sound
man
of
business
you
know
then
i
felt
that
i
trust
my
judgment
the
whole
world
was
upside
down
but
now
i
feel
that
i
can
think
clearly
and
of
course
i
am
anxious
to
do
my
best
for
you
been
thinking
about
this
oxford
plan
know
quite
well
edwin
that
not
a
rich
man
a
very
poor
man
you
can
understand
that
better
than
you
could
before
after
this
holiday
and
when
people
have
very
limited
means
and
are
getting
on
in
business
has
made
me
an
old
man
you
have
to
be
very
careful
in
their
decisions
looking
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
i
think
it
would
be
fair
of
me
to
let
you
go
to
what
do
you
mean
begin
with
the
i
shall
get
a
scholarship
work
like
anything
make
sure
of
sure
you
would
a
good
boy
but
that
everything
by
a
long
way
when
got
your
scholarship
supposing
you
do
get
it
the
expense
would
begin
i
like
you
to
feel
at
a
hopeless
disadvantage
with
men
of
your
own
year
you
would
have
to
live
quite
a
different
life
from
them
you
be
able
to
afford
any
of
their
want
their
is
a
rash
thing
to
say
but
looking
even
farther
ahead
what
can
you
expect
to
do
when
taken
a
degree
in
arts
fellowship
but
that
is
a
matter
of
considerable
uncertainty
seen
so
many
men
who
have
managed
to
scrape
through
a
university
degree
and
then
been
thrown
on
the
world
in
a
state
of
miserable
poverty
look
at
kelly
at
the
you
like
to
live
his
life
but
i
believe
he
has
quite
a
brilliant
university
career
behind
him
no
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
mother
and
i
always
said
i
know
you
were
a
pair
of
dreamers
both
of
you
if
you
felt
any
very
strong
desire
to
become
a
parson
there
might
be
something
in
it
though
that
too
is
a
miserable
life
often
enough
but
you
do
you
of
course
i
think
that
while
i
am
living
you
should
have
the
chance
of
learning
a
useful
profession
what
about
doctoring
that
would
be
expensive
know
that
but
i
think
we
could
do
it
we
should
have
a
little
in
common
i
might
even
be
able
to
help
you
and
in
a
way
in
a
way
i
should
feel
that
in
you
i
was
realising
some
of
my
own
old
ambitions
it
is
a
noble
profession
eddie
the
most
humane
in
the
world
no
one
need
ever
be
ashamed
of
being
a
doctor
i
think
that
a
parson
who
professes
religion
for
the
sake
of
a
living
is
rather
to
be
sure
it
would
cost
too
much
six
years
you
know
only
five
if
you
pass
all
your
examinations
and
it
need
not
be
so
expensive
as
you
think
during
the
last
year
they
have
turned
the
old
college
in
north
bromwich
into
a
university
they
give
a
degree
in
medicine
and
while
you
were
studying
there
you
could
still
live
with
me
at
halesby
i
should
be
glad
of
your
this
appeal
to
pity
was
difficult
to
resist
it
recalled
to
him
all
the
resolutions
that
he
had
made
in
the
night
at
wringford
the
devotion
with
which
he
had
determined
to
devote
himself
to
his
welfare
the
determination
that
he
should
never
do
anything
that
could
cause
the
man
a
pain
it
was
difficult
difficult
could
still
get
your
scholarship
his
father
went
on
are
several
endowments
of
that
kind
at
the
north
bromwich
medical
school
i
have
a
pamphlet
at
home
that
gives
all
the
particulars
i
had
even
shown
it
to
your
what
did
she
say
father
say
much
she
knew
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
you
but
i
think
she
realised
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
and
i
know
she
looked
forward
to
having
you
at
she
must
have
known
what
a
disappointment
it
would
be
father
i
wish
you
would
think
it
over
want
you
to
think
it
over
too
at
present
it
naturally
comes
as
a
shock
to
you
but
i
think
see
in
time
he
see
he
knew
that
he
could
never
see
it
in
that
light
it
was
going
to
take
all
the
beauty
that
he
had
conceived
out
of
his
life
it
was
going
to
ruin
all
his
happiness
in
place
of
light
and
cleanliness
and
learning
it
was
going
to
give
him
what
the
darkness
of
a
smoky
city
its
grime
the
mean
ideals
of
the
people
who
lived
beneath
its
ugliness
even
the
memory
of
the
enthusiasm
with
which
he
had
thought
of
the
life
of
old
marshall
his
patron
mitigate
the
dreariness
of
the
prospect
the
idea
of
living
for
ever
in
company
with
dirt
and
misery
and
harrowing
disease
repelled
him
it
was
no
good
telling
him
that
contact
with
these
misfortunes
developed
the
nobler
faculties
of
man
it
was
not
the
life
that
he
had
wanted
his
soul
sent
forth
a
cry
of
exceeding
bitterness
and
while
he
sat
there
full
of
misery
and
resentment
the
train
was
carrying
them
onward
into
the
gloom
that
always
overshadowed
the
city
of
iron
book
ii
that
with
much
ado
i
was
made
to
learn
the
dirty
devices
of
the
thomas
traherne
chapter
i
the
city
of
iron
i
the
city
of
iron
stands
upon
three
hills
and
its
valleys
were
once
watered
by
two
rivers
but
since
the
day
when
its
name
was
humbly
written
in
doomsday
these
pastoral
features
have
disappeared
so
that
the
hills
are
only
known
as
tramway
gradients
that
testify
to
the
excellence
of
the
power
station
and
the
rivers
running
in
brick
culverts
have
been
deprived
not
only
of
their
liberty
but
even
of
their
natural
function
of
receiving
a
portion
of
the
gigantic
sewage
the
original
market
of
north
bromwich
has
been
not
so
much
debauched
from
without
in
the
manner
of
other
growing
towns
as
organised
from
within
by
the
development
of
its
own
inherent
powers
for
evil
it
is
not
a
place
from
which
men
have
wilfully
cast
out
beauty
so
much
as
one
from
which
beauty
has
vanished
in
spite
of
pitiful
aspirations
to
preserve
it
indeed
its
citizens
are
objects
rather
for
pity
than
for
reproach
and
would
be
astonished
to
receive
either
for
many
of
them
are
wealthy
and
from
their
childhood
knowing
no
better
have
believed
that
wealth
is
a
justification
and
an
apology
for
every
mortal
evil
from
ugliness
to
original
sin
in
the
heart
of
the
city
the
sense
of
power
impressive
if
malignant
is
so
overwhelming
that
one
can
not
see
the
monstrosity
as
a
whole
and
can
almost
understand
the
blindness
of
its
inhabitants
go
rather
to
the
hills
beyond
halesby
to
uffdown
and
pen
beacon
where
with
a
choice
of
prospects
one
may
turn
from
the
dreamy
plain
of
severn
and
the
cloudy
splendours
of
silurian
hills
to
its
pillars
of
cloud
by
day
and
its
pillars
of
fire
by
night
and
perhaps
in
that
remoter
air
you
may
realise
the
true
significance
as
a
phenomenon
of
unconquered
if
not
inevitable
disease
if
you
are
a
physician
you
will
realise
that
this
evil
has
its
counterpart
in
human
tissues
where
a
single
cell
that
differs
not
at
all
from
other
cells
and
is
a
natural
unit
in
the
organism
may
suddenly
and
as
it
seems
unreasonably
acquire
a
faculty
of
monstrous
and
malignant
growth
cleaving
and
multiplying
to
the
destruction
of
its
cell
gone
mad
to
which
the
ancients
gave
the
name
of
cancer
the
inhabitants
of
north
bromwich
who
are
a
tolerant
people
and
proud
of
the
fact
would
smile
at
this
reflection
they
are
not
in
the
habit
of
surveying
the
midden
in
which
they
are
bred
from
remote
hilltops
except
on
bank
holidays
at
which
time
they
have
discovered
a
truth
from
which
they
might
learn
more
that
with
the
aid
of
hill
air
and
exercise
whether
it
be
that
of
cocoanut
shies
or
or
the
more
hazardous
pursuit
of
it
is
possible
to
absorb
a
greater
quantity
of
alcohol
in
a
given
time
without
unduly
suffering
than
in
the
atmosphere
of
their
own
streets
but
they
have
not
time
to
learn
and
since
they
have
never
known
any
other
conditions
of
living
they
exhibit
the
admirable
human
characteristic
of
making
the
best
of
their
surroundings
and
persuading
themselves
that
their
hallucinated
existence
is
typical
of
human
life
they
are
even
eager
pathetically
eager
to
find
and
to
proclaim
its
virtues
and
that
they
may
do
this
more
easily
they
have
invented
specious
names
for
the
disease
and
its
results
industry
for
the
first
and
for
the
second
progress
in
the
vindication
of
a
municipal
conscience
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
they
periodically
extend
the
area
over
which
their
coat
of
arms
a
reminder
of
days
when
chivalry
existed
is
displayed
the
coat
of
arms
itself
is
an
unfortunate
symbol
for
it
is
supported
by
the
figure
of
a
brawny
slave
who
carries
the
hammer
with
which
his
chains
have
been
forged
but
the
motto
at
least
is
encouraging
it
is
the
word
expressing
the
aspirations
of
the
citizens
towards
the
day
when
all
england
may
be
as
the
black
country
the
watcher
on
uffdown
may
give
it
a
more
significance
to
the
day
when
there
shall
be
no
more
coal
and
the
evil
of
its
own
inanition
for
the
present
at
any
rate
the
city
showed
no
signs
of
perishing
during
the
last
year
or
two
its
tentacles
had
spread
farther
than
ever
before
swarming
into
the
wet
and
lonely
valley
of
the
dulas
fechan
a
deep
cleft
in
the
mountains
beyond
felindre
where
a
noisy
river
ran
through
undergrowth
older
than
memory
from
this
valley
the
council
had
decreed
the
rain
of
the
savaddan
watershed
which
geology
had
destined
for
the
wye
and
later
for
the
atlantic
must
now
traverse
eighty
miles
or
more
of
conquered
territory
and
after
being
defouled
by
the
domestic
usages
of
north
bromwich
must
find
its
way
into
the
trent
and
so
to
the
german
ocean
as
the
romans
thoughtlessly
labelled
the
north
sea
said
the
mayor
who
was
also
known
as
sir
joseph
astill
the
brewer
is
one
of
the
necessities
of
life
it
is
our
duty
to
the
public
to
see
that
they
have
it
and
that
they
have
it
pure
and
so
the
welsh
water
came
and
the
altruistic
baronet
took
the
credit
for
it
indeed
the
progressive
spirit
of
north
bromwich
found
its
incarnation
in
this
fleshy
gentleman
it
was
he
who
presented
the
municipal
art
gallery
with
their
unrivalled
collection
of
cartoons
to
say
nothing
of
three
portraits
of
himself
exemplifying
he
had
an
elegant
vocabulary
the
styles
of
the
three
greatest
portrait
painters
of
modern
times
it
was
he
who
saved
the
art
of
music
from
degradation
by
fighting
with
all
the
weight
of
his
personal
influence
against
the
performance
of
secular
music
music
that
is
divorced
from
words
upon
the
sabbath
it
was
he
again
who
aroused
public
feeling
on
the
question
of
the
university
first
modern
university
he
called
it
he
accomplished
its
endowment
equipped
it
with
a
principal
whose
name
was
a
household
word
in
the
homes
of
the
great
middle
classes
and
finally
set
the
seal
of
modernity
on
his
creation
less
than
twenty
years
before
the
total
prohibition
of
alcohol
became
law
in
retrograde
america
by
instituting
a
learned
faculty
and
providing
a
degree
in
the
science
of
brewing
just
as
an
example
of
the
liberality
there
was
also
a
faculty
of
arts
the
faculty
of
science
of
course
was
important
if
only
as
an
appendage
to
the
brewing
school
those
of
engineering
and
mining
flattered
the
industries
of
the
district
that
of
commerce
taught
its
graduates
to
write
business
letters
in
every
spoken
tongue
and
give
the
yankees
what
for
and
lastly
that
of
medicine
supplied
a
necessary
antidote
to
the
activities
of
most
of
the
others
sir
joseph
astill
was
proud
as
well
he
might
be
of
the
medical
school
this
city
he
boasted
are
actually
more
hospital
beds
of
inhabitants
than
in
any
other
in
the
whole
country
the
north
bromwich
medical
student
has
a
greater
opportunity
of
studying
disease
in
all
its
aspects
than
the
alumnus
of
any
other
school
in
the
world
thousands
of
beds
lie
waiting
for
his
scrutiny
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
very
few
of
them
are
ever
first
serious
acquaintance
with
north
bromwich
had
begun
at
the
end
of
the
summer
holidays
through
which
he
had
worked
with
a
good
deal
less
than
the
fiery
enthusiasm
that
he
would
have
put
into
his
reading
for
the
balliol
scholarship
the
syllabus
of
the
examination
for
the
astill
exhibition
had
amazed
him
by
its
simplicity
the
prescribed
books
were
works
that
he
had
absorbed
some
years
before
at
and
though
the
mathematical
side
of
the
business
worried
him
as
it
had
always
done
it
was
clear
that
in
north
bromwich
the
classics
were
regarded
really
as
a
polite
accomplishment
rather
than
as
an
integral
part
of
a
equipment
in
life
so
that
these
drowsy
summer
months
were
really
a
period
of
comparative
idleness
in
which
he
had
time
to
brood
on
his
regrets
and
become
gradually
reconciled
to
his
new
fate
in
this
spirit
he
approached
the
examination
even
the
capitoline
eminence
on
which
the
university
buildings
were
placed
with
the
tremendous
renaissance
buildings
of
the
council
house
and
the
corinthian
town
hall
did
not
greatly
impress
him
he
saw
rather
the
squalid
slums
from
which
these
pretentious
buildings
rose
it
was
so
different
he
thought
from
oxford
and
he
passed
the
flagged
courtyard
with
its
cool
fountain
and
the
benevolent
statue
of
sir
joseph
astill
in
a
frock
coat
and
carrying
a
rolled
umbrella
on
which
the
sculptor
had
lavished
all
the
feeling
of
his
art
without
the
least
shadow
of
spiritual
obeisance
with
two
other
candidates
he
had
worked
through
his
papers
in
a
small
room
whose
windows
overlooked
the
quiet
square
and
a
phantom
stream
of
noiseless
traffic
beyond
the
first
paper
had
been
mathematical
and
its
intricacies
kept
his
mind
so
busy
that
he
had
little
time
for
reflection
from
time
to
time
he
would
see
one
of
the
competitors
reducing
the
end
of
his
penholder
to
in
the
earnestness
of
ruminant
thought
and
occasionally
the
deep
boom
of
the
clock
in
the
tower
of
the
art
gallery
would
remind
him
that
time
was
veritably
passing
but
time
passed
swiftly
and
he
was
almost
surprised
to
find
himself
once
more
in
an
air
that
for
all
its
vitiation
was
less
sleepy
than
that
of
the
sealed
examination
room
by
the
end
of
the
first
evening
all
that
he
feared
in
the
examination
papers
was
over
he
would
be
on
his
own
ground
and
the
modern
university
could
do
its
damnedest
next
day
the
classical
papers
were
distributed
and
edwin
who
found
them
easy
could
see
that
his
friend
was
in
a
bad
way
all
the
passages
set
for
translation
were
familiar
the
grammatical
questions
consisted
of
old
catches
that
had
been
drilled
into
him
by
leeming
in
the
upper
fourth
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
was
a
walk
over
he
had
time
to
take
in
more
of
his
surroundings
and
to
watch
the
silent
coloured
stream
of
traffic
filtering
through
the
narrows
where
the
bulk
of
the
town
hall
constricted
the
street
at
the
end
of
each
day
he
found
his
father
anxiously
awaiting
him
he
was
eager
to
see
and
handle
the
examination
papers
for
himself
he
seemed
impressed
by
their
difficulty
and
edwin
found
it
hard
to
reassure
him
without
appearing
objectionably
superior
he
seemed
rather
surprised
that
edwin
on
the
eve
of
such
a
formidable
ordeal
should
choose
to
take
out
his
bicycle
and
ride
towards
the
hills
so
surprised
that
it
became
a
matter
for
serious
debate
with
edwin
whether
he
should
do
as
he
wanted
to
do
and
appear
priggish
or
affect
an
anxiety
that
exist
merely
to
please
his
father
in
the
end
he
decided
to
be
honest
at
all
costs
the
part
of
the
examination
that
he
enjoyed
most
was
the
in
classics
for
this
trial
he
was
led
up
many
flights
of
stone
steps
to
a
room
full
of
books
in
which
the
dean
of
the
faculty
of
arts
awaited
him
a
kindly
nervous
old
man
with
a
grey
beard
with
whom
edwin
immediately
felt
at
home
his
nervousness
seemed
to
edwin
appropriate
it
implied
the
indubitable
fact
that
in
north
bromwich
arts
was
a
sideshow
that
counted
for
nothing
and
that
the
dignity
as
dean
of
a
learned
faculty
was
a
precarious
and
unsubstantial
thing
papers
were
excellent
excellent
he
said
to
begin
with
i
should
like
you
to
read
me
he
pointed
to
a
bookshelf
us
start
with
some
would
you
like
sir
not
what
i
should
like
what
would
you
like
to
read
something
that
really
appeals
to
edwin
felt
that
the
dean
was
watching
him
like
a
cat
stalking
a
bird
as
his
fingers
approached
the
bookshelf
it
was
a
curious
responsibility
for
it
would
be
an
awful
shame
if
he
chose
something
that
the
old
man
approve
of
why
not
sophocles
he
picked
out
the
antigone
and
chose
the
great
chorus
ἔρως
ἀνίκατε
μάχαν
ἔρως
ὁς
ἐν
κτήμασι
πίπτεις
have
it
in
greek
edwin
read
it
in
the
level
voice
which
the
head
of
had
always
used
for
the
recitation
of
greek
poetry
when
he
had
finished
the
first
strophe
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
the
weak
eyes
beneath
their
tortoiseshell
spectacles
were
brimming
with
tears
will
do
he
said
prefer
to
go
on
edwin
read
the
antistrophe
i
think
you
need
translate
it
said
the
dean
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
replacing
the
volume
went
on
this
university
i
am
known
as
the
professor
of
dead
languages
dead
languages
what
they
passed
a
pleasant
together
in
latin
edwin
chose
lucretius
and
a
passage
from
the
georgics
at
the
end
of
which
the
dean
confided
to
him
that
he
kept
bees
you
that
will
do
he
said
gather
that
you
are
entering
the
medical
well
it
is
a
noble
profession
i
know
what
we
should
do
without
doctors
four
days
later
ingleby
received
him
at
the
breakfast
table
with
unconcealed
emotion
got
your
scholarship
edwin
as
pleased
as
if
won
it
myself
i
never
had
the
opportunity
of
winning
a
scholarship
in
my
the
hand
in
which
he
held
the
letter
trembled
he
kissed
edwin
fervently
is
a
great
day
for
me
he
said
and
edwin
glowing
felt
that
anything
was
worth
while
that
could
give
such
pleasure
to
the
man
that
he
had
determined
to
love
ii
on
a
bright
morning
at
the
beginning
of
september
edwin
found
himself
one
of
a
crowd
of
ten
or
fifteen
youths
waiting
with
a
varying
degree
of
assurance
outside
the
office
of
the
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
in
james
street
a
sordid
thoroughfare
in
which
the
pretentious
buildings
of
the
old
college
of
science
hid
its
hinder
quarters
the
door
was
small
and
only
distinguished
from
its
neighbours
a
steam
laundry
and
office
by
a
plate
that
bore
the
inscription
of
north
bromwich
medical
inside
the
door
stood
a
wooden
box
for
a
porter
usually
empty
but
in
its
moments
of
occupation
surveying
a
long
dark
cloakroom
with
a
hundred
or
more
numbered
lockers
and
corresponding
on
a
few
of
which
gowns
and
battered
were
hanging
this
morning
the
dean
was
holding
audience
of
all
the
first
year
men
and
each
of
the
crowd
in
which
edwin
now
found
himself
a
negligible
unit
was
waiting
until
his
name
should
be
called
from
the
office
and
in
the
meantime
surveying
his
companions
with
suspicion
and
being
surveyed
with
a
more
confident
and
collective
suspicion
by
seniors
who
happened
to
drift
through
the
corridors
on
business
or
idleness
and
showed
evidence
of
their
initiation
by
familiarity
with
the
porter
only
one
face
in
the
company
was
in
the
least
familiar
to
edwin
that
of
a
ponderous
young
man
with
immaculate
black
hair
carefully
parted
in
the
middle
who
had
sat
stolidly
through
the
astill
exhibition
examination
a
few
desks
away
from
him
as
he
did
not
appear
to
be
anxious
to
recognise
this
fact
edwin
abandoned
his
own
intention
of
doing
so
and
like
the
rest
of
the
company
possessed
his
soul
in
silence
in
the
meantime
he
watched
the
others
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
and
speculation
they
were
a
strangely
mixed
company
a
few
of
them
of
whom
edwin
himself
was
one
mere
boys
to
whom
the
air
of
the
schoolroom
still
clung
some
obvious
men
of
the
world
scrupulously
even
doggily
dressed
in
an
age
when
the
fancy
waistcoat
had
reached
the
zenith
of
its
daring
others
and
one
other
in
particular
a
seedy
looking
person
with
a
dejected
fair
moustache
were
clearly
old
enough
to
be
the
fathers
of
the
youngest
it
was
to
the
second
of
these
classes
the
bloods
that
edwin
found
his
attention
attracted
and
particularly
to
a
paragon
of
elegance
whose
waistcoat
was
the
orange
colour
of
a
bill
with
light
blue
enamelled
buttons
whose
hair
was
mathematically
bisected
and
shone
with
expensive
unguents
and
whose
chin
differed
from
that
of
edwin
in
being
shaved
from
sheer
necessity
instead
of
from
motives
of
encouragement
this
person
exuded
an
atmosphere
of
prosperity
and
style
that
took
fancy
immensely
and
he
wore
grey
flannel
trousers
as
correctly
turned
up
as
any
that
edwin
had
seen
upon
the
enchanted
platform
of
the
station
at
oxford
it
was
evident
that
the
process
of
waiting
bored
him
for
he
took
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
amazing
waistcoat
a
gold
hunter
watch
with
a
front
enamelled
in
the
same
shade
of
light
blue
the
lid
flicked
open
noiselessly
when
he
touched
a
spring
and
edwin
began
to
be
exercised
in
his
mind
as
to
what
happened
when
he
put
on
a
waistcoat
of
a
different
pattern
as
obviously
a
person
of
this
degree
of
magnificence
must
frequently
do
did
he
change
the
buttons
or
did
he
change
the
watch
edwin
surveying
him
looked
unconsciously
at
his
own
waterbury
and
as
he
did
so
the
magnificent
creature
glanced
at
him
with
a
pair
of
savage
brown
eyes
and
as
edwin
decided
summed
him
up
for
good
and
all
harrop
please
said
the
porter
and
harrop
pocketed
his
hunter
and
disdainfully
entered
the
office
edwin
relieved
from
his
scrutiny
turned
his
attention
to
the
most
impressive
figure
of
all
a
young
man
fully
six
feet
four
in
height
but
so
broadly
and
heavily
built
that
his
tallness
was
scarcely
noticeable
his
face
was
and
very
plain
with
the
look
of
battered
obstinacy
that
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
that
of
a
boxer
perhaps
this
idea
was
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
his
short
nose
was
broken
and
that
he
carried
his
whole
face
a
little
forward
staring
out
at
the
world
from
under
bushy
black
eyebrows
he
seemed
made
for
rough
usage
and
his
undoubted
strength
was
qualified
by
a
degree
of
awkwardness
that
showed
itself
in
his
clumsy
hands
these
at
the
present
time
were
clasped
behind
his
back
beneath
the
folds
of
a
gown
that
because
of
his
great
height
looked
ridiculously
small
his
whole
aspect
was
one
of
terrific
earnestness
evidently
he
was
taking
this
business
as
he
would
surely
have
taken
any
other
seriously
that
no
doubt
was
the
reason
why
on
this
occasion
he
alone
appeared
in
academical
dress
his
clasped
hands
his
lowered
head
his
bulldog
neck
all
spoke
of
a
determination
to
go
through
with
this
adventure
at
all
costs
brown
said
the
porter
and
nearly
blundering
into
the
returning
elegance
of
harrop
he
slouched
into
the
office
as
though
he
were
entering
the
ring
for
the
championship
of
the
world
in
the
end
edwin
found
himself
left
alone
with
a
youth
of
his
own
age
a
tall
creature
with
an
indefinite
humorous
face
a
close
crop
of
curly
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
edwin
rather
liked
the
look
of
him
he
was
young
and
seemed
approachable
and
though
his
striped
flannel
suit
was
more
elegant
than
and
he
wore
a
school
tie
of
knitted
silk
edwin
took
the
risk
of
addressing
him
seem
to
be
the
i
expect
the
dean
will
keep
me
last
of
all
bad
cess
to
him
because
i
happen
to
be
a
sort
of
cousin
of
the
old
he
spoke
with
a
soft
brogue
that
had
come
from
the
south
of
ireland
ingleby
edwin
pulled
himself
together
and
entered
the
office
a
pleasant
room
at
one
big
desk
a
suave
gentleman
with
thin
sandy
hair
and
spectacles
at
another
a
little
dark
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
typewriter
in
front
of
him
ingleby
said
the
first
his
voice
was
refined
if
a
little
too
precise
ingleby
what
are
you
going
to
do
ah
yes
you
are
the
astill
scholar
very
good
very
good
are
you
proposing
to
take
a
london
degree
sir
north
it
is
possible
you
may
change
your
mind
later
have
you
taken
the
london
matriculation
sir
i
was
on
the
classical
side
at
i
was
reading
for
a
scholarship
at
changed
your
mind
shrewdly
it
changed
for
you
your
father
a
doctor
it
really
matter
what
my
father
is
thought
edwin
and
the
dean
as
though
answering
his
reflection
said
that
and
after
a
pause
er
ingleby
you
have
made
a
good
beginning
i
hope
it
will
continue
satisfactorily
that
is
all
thank
you
he
held
out
his
hand
to
edwin
who
was
astonished
into
putting
out
a
moist
hand
himself
continued
the
dean
in
a
suave
reflective
voice
will
pay
your
fees
to
my
secretary
hadley
this
is
er
hadley
hadley
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
a
lift
of
the
right
eyebrow
and
edwin
left
the
room
martin
said
the
secretary
as
he
left
and
martin
please
the
porter
repeated
say
wait
a
moment
for
me
said
the
irishman
to
edwin
in
passing
it
was
so
friendly
as
to
be
cheering
seems
a
decent
old
bird
said
martin
emerging
a
few
minutes
later
thought
you
said
he
was
your
cousin
he
is
you
see
irish
and
so
is
he
and
in
ireland
pretty
nearly
everybody
who
is
anybody
is
related
to
everybody
he
plunged
into
a
lengthy
demonstration
of
the
relationships
of
the
southern
aristocracy
with
warnings
as
to
the
gulfs
that
separated
the
martins
from
the
martyns
and
the
plunketts
from
the
plunkets
rambling
away
through
a
world
of
and
penury
in
which
all
the
inhabitants
called
each
other
by
their
christian
names
and
spent
their
lives
in
hunting
racing
and
elaborate
practical
jokes
a
new
world
to
edwin
they
strolled
down
sackville
row
together
and
cutting
through
the
arcades
came
out
into
the
wide
thoroughfare
of
queen
street
that
had
been
driven
through
an
area
of
slums
in
honour
of
first
jubilee
the
way
your
school
said
denis
martin
heard
of
suppose
you
would
in
i
go
to
school
in
ireland
nobody
does
i
was
at
marlborough
is
one
of
those
soccer
schools
lord
we
play
rugger
pretty
do
you
play
taylors
and
and
one
or
two
day
schools
they
is
that
sort
edwin
with
enthusiasm
expounded
the
legend
that
nobody
outside
of
has
ever
been
known
to
believe
martin
meanwhile
looked
a
little
supercilious
and
bored
he
spoke
as
from
a
distant
world
in
a
tone
that
implied
that
the
people
of
north
bromwich
could
never
call
each
other
by
their
christian
names
or
hunt
or
race
or
play
practical
jokes
with
an
air
of
being
born
to
it
expect
a
pretty
mixed
lot
here
he
said
and
edwin
with
the
guilty
consciousness
of
being
more
than
a
little
mixed
himself
replied
extraordinary
collection
that
great
dark
fellow
looks
an
absolute
tyke
then
the
chap
with
the
harrop
was
the
know
the
name
said
martin
dubiously
heard
of
the
family
he
was
wearing
an
oriel
do
you
mean
oxford
one
of
my
cousins
was
there
how
i
know
it
i
should
think
they
turfed
him
out
on
account
of
that
waistcoat
still
oxford
what
it
used
to
the
eyes
of
a
southern
unionist
he
might
have
added
but
the
news
was
grateful
to
edwin
wonder
martin
went
on
lots
of
decent
people
end
by
coming
to
schools
like
this
i
expect
it
is
the
idea
you
know
i
say
what
about
lunch
do
you
know
of
any
decent
place
in
ancient
days
when
he
had
come
into
north
bromwich
shopping
with
his
mother
edwin
had
always
been
taken
to
the
great
in
queen
street
but
now
passing
the
doors
in
this
exalted
company
he
felt
that
the
company
of
a
crowd
of
shabby
shopping
women
would
hardly
be
suitable
besides
he
might
even
run
the
risk
of
meeting
his
aunt
laura
who
also
frequented
the
shop
so
he
left
prudently
alone
know
one
place
said
martin
should
think
all
right
the
decent
he
led
the
way
up
a
side
street
to
an
elegant
resort
frequented
by
the
professional
classes
of
north
bromwich
where
them
was
a
long
counter
set
out
with
sandwiches
like
a
buffet
at
a
dance
and
all
the
customers
seemed
at
home
in
the
ordinary
way
edwin
would
not
have
dared
to
enter
it
but
martin
with
the
elegant
confidence
of
southern
unionism
showed
him
the
way
and
seated
at
a
table
they
trifled
with
plover
on
toast
martin
of
course
did
the
choosing
and
in
his
dealings
with
the
tiny
carcass
showed
a
familiarity
with
the
correct
method
of
consuming
small
birds
that
edwin
was
pleased
to
learn
shoot
plover
he
said
no
edwin
had
never
shot
anything
he
particularly
want
to
shoot
anything
but
he
realised
that
it
was
a
great
accomplishment
to
be
able
to
talk
about
it
as
though
he
had
never
done
anything
else
pay
said
martin
can
square
up
they
did
so
and
thawed
by
the
process
of
feeding
began
to
talk
more
easily
you
digging
in
this
place
martin
asked
edwin
told
him
that
he
lived
in
the
country
the
country
i
know
there
was
any
here
have
you
any
decent
shooting
he
remembered
however
the
solitary
trout
under
the
bridge
below
the
abbey
fishing
of
sorts
he
said
sorts
trout
not
much
fun
in
that
white
trout
sea
trout
you
call
them
in
england
are
good
sport
still
have
a
day
together
next
spring
get
my
rods
the
subject
was
dangerous
and
so
edwin
asked
him
where
he
was
living
your
cousin
i
i
know
the
old
divil
you
know
rooms
with
an
old
lady
up
in
alvaston
rather
a
decent
sort
house
full
of
he
specify
what
the
animals
were
better
go
and
unpack
some
of
my
things
i
suppose
i
shall
see
you
at
the
chemistry
lecture
so
oh
i
your
name
he
boarded
a
passing
bus
with
the
air
of
stepping
on
to
a
coach
and
four
edwin
took
the
next
train
home
on
the
opposite
platform
of
the
station
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
great
bulk
of
the
man
named
brown
walking
up
and
down
with
earnestness
in
his
eyes
and
under
his
arm
a
huge
parcel
of
books
he
gave
edwin
the
impression
of
wanting
to
throw
himself
into
the
adventure
of
the
medical
curriculum
as
he
might
have
thrown
himself
into
a
rugby
scrum
expecting
a
repetition
of
the
tremendous
battering
that
he
seemed
already
to
have
undergone
thinking
of
him
and
of
the
aristocratic
martin
and
of
harrop
a
product
which
oriel
had
finished
to
the
last
waistcoat
button
and
more
dimly
of
the
elderly
gentleman
with
the
dejected
moustaches
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
he
himself
was
appallingly
young
and
callow
and
inexperienced
how
was
he
going
to
stand
up
to
these
people
with
their
knowledge
of
the
world
and
its
ways
men
who
had
already
by
virtue
of
their
birth
or
experience
learned
how
to
dress
and
live
and
move
without
effort
in
the
crowded
world
yet
with
them
he
knew
he
must
now
take
his
place
it
would
be
difficult
awfully
difficult
he
had
everything
even
the
most
elementary
rules
of
conduct
to
learn
he
was
a
child
who
had
never
known
another
human
being
except
his
mother
and
a
few
school
friends
of
his
own
age
he
had
not
even
the
of
griffin
and
in
this
new
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
dreams
on
which
he
had
depended
must
be
even
more
a
positive
handicap
to
his
success
the
moments
of
sudden
spiritual
enlightenment
that
one
reads
of
in
the
lives
of
saints
or
of
converts
to
salvationism
are
not
a
common
experience
in
those
of
ordinary
men
and
though
in
the
turn
of
every
tide
there
is
a
critical
period
measurable
by
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
which
the
waters
that
have
swayed
forwards
retire
upon
themselves
to
the
eyes
of
an
observer
the
change
of
motion
is
so
gradual
as
to
be
only
slowly
perceived
in
life
the
death
of
his
mother
had
been
the
real
point
of
crisis
but
this
he
had
only
dimly
realised
when
his
hopes
of
oxford
had
been
dashed
for
ever
in
a
compartment
hurtling
under
bredon
hill
between
it
and
the
present
moment
there
had
hung
a
period
of
dead
water
so
to
speak
in
which
the
current
of
his
life
had
seemed
suspended
but
now
he
knew
that
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
a
change
had
overtaken
him
and
that
he
would
never
again
be
the
same
all
his
life
up
to
this
point
had
been
curiously
inorganic
a
haphazard
succession
of
novel
and
bewildering
sensations
a
kaleidoscope
of
sensual
impressions
changing
almost
too
rapidly
to
be
rapidly
that
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
think
of
one
in
relation
to
another
some
of
them
had
been
painful
some
enthralling
in
their
beauty
some
merely
engrossing
because
they
were
full
of
awe
yet
all
had
been
ecstatic
and
tinged
in
some
degree
with
a
visionary
light
now
as
always
it
was
clear
that
he
must
be
a
dreamer
but
from
this
day
onwards
it
also
became
clear
that
his
visions
must
be
something
more
to
him
than
a
series
of
coloured
impressions
succeeding
one
another
without
reason
and
accepted
without
explanation
in
the
future
they
must
be
correlated
with
experience
and
the
demands
of
life
in
that
lost
age
of
innocence
the
people
with
whom
he
came
into
contact
had
interested
him
only
as
figures
passing
through
the
scenes
that
were
spread
for
his
delectation
they
had
been
external
to
him
he
had
lived
within
himself
and
his
loneliness
had
been
so
that
it
would
have
made
no
great
difference
to
him
if
they
had
not
been
there
now
he
was
to
take
his
part
in
the
drama
at
which
in
times
before
he
had
merely
sat
as
a
bemused
spectator
it
was
a
stirring
and
a
terrifying
prospect
the
train
from
north
bromwich
stopped
at
every
station
and
the
whole
of
the
journey
lay
through
the
black
desert
that
fringes
the
iron
city
a
vast
basin
of
imprisoned
smoke
bounded
by
hills
that
had
once
been
crowned
with
woods
but
were
now
dominated
by
the
high
of
collieries
many
of
them
ruined
and
deserted
at
a
dirty
junction
so
undermined
with
workings
that
the
bridge
and
the
brick
offices
were
distorted
in
a
manner
which
suggested
that
the
whole
affair
might
some
day
go
down
quick
into
the
pit
he
changed
into
the
local
train
the
railway
company
evidently
did
not
consider
the
passenger
traffic
of
halesby
worth
consideration
for
the
carriages
were
old
and
grimy
edwin
chose
a
smoker
because
the
cushions
were
covered
with
american
leather
and
therefore
more
obviously
clean
he
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
his
reflections
sitting
opposite
a
coloured
photograph
of
the
great
gorge
at
axcombe
a
town
that
was
served
by
the
same
line
the
picture
carried
him
suddenly
to
another
aspect
of
his
too
complicated
life
really
the
whole
business
was
hopelessly
involved
he
thought
grimly
how
he
could
have
taken
the
wind
out
of
genealogical
sails
by
blurting
out
the
astounding
intelligence
that
his
uncle
was
a
gardener
and
what
would
the
gentleman
with
the
waistcoat
have
said
he
laughed
at
the
idea
through
a
short
but
sulphurous
tunnel
the
train
emerged
into
the
valley
of
the
stour
the
vista
of
the
hills
unfolded
and
later
the
spire
of
halesby
church
appeared
at
the
head
well
a
beginning
of
the
new
life
had
to
be
made
some
day
and
now
as
well
as
ever
walking
home
along
the
cinder
pathway
beside
the
silting
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
light
of
his
new
experience
halesby
was
a
primitive
and
almost
pitiable
place
and
the
same
mood
held
him
when
he
made
his
way
home
by
the
short
cut
through
cloistered
garden
and
entered
his
house
under
the
south
wall
the
bed
of
double
stocks
was
still
in
flower
though
faded
and
bedraggled
their
scent
reminded
him
of
what
a
world
of
experience
he
had
traversed
in
less
than
three
months
he
went
straight
up
to
his
own
bedroom
on
the
bed
lay
two
parcels
addressed
to
him
the
larger
contained
his
cap
and
gown
he
put
them
on
in
front
of
the
glass
and
rather
fancied
himself
the
act
struck
him
as
in
a
way
symbolical
it
was
the
token
of
an
initiation
from
that
day
forward
he
was
a
medical
student
for
five
or
six
years
probably
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
spend
his
time
in
the
presence
of
the
most
bitter
human
experience
but
there
was
something
elevating
in
the
thought
that
he
need
not
be
a
helpless
spectator
he
would
be
able
to
effect
positive
good
in
a
way
that
no
scholar
and
no
preacher
of
religion
or
abstract
morality
could
possibly
attain
is
my
life
he
thought
well
it
was
good
to
know
anything
as
definite
as
that
the
second
parcel
contained
a
number
of
technical
books
dealing
with
the
subjects
of
his
first
curriculum
chemistry
physics
biology
physiology
and
anatomy
the
last
appeared
to
be
the
most
exciting
and
wonderfully
made
he
thought
he
set
to
work
at
once
preparing
the
little
room
for
work
making
it
as
comfortable
as
he
could
with
a
writing
table
in
the
window
that
looked
out
over
woods
and
dethroning
the
superannuated
henty
and
fenn
from
the
bookshelf
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
treat
his
poets
so
cavalierly
and
so
there
they
stayed
greek
and
latin
and
english
shall
never
drop
my
classics
he
thought
a
resolution
that
has
been
forgotten
nearly
as
often
as
it
has
been
made
in
the
blenheim
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
a
thrush
was
singing
bullfinches
were
fighting
shrilly
in
the
raspberry
canes
he
threw
open
the
window
and
there
ascended
to
him
the
heavy
faded
perfume
of
the
bed
of
stocks
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
a
photograph
of
his
mother
looking
at
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
smiled
chapter
ii
mortality
behold
i
he
was
happy
even
halesby
became
a
grateful
place
of
retirement
after
his
long
days
in
north
bromwich
the
mornings
of
early
autumn
were
very
beautiful
and
it
was
with
a
good
deal
of
zest
that
he
would
scramble
through
his
breakfast
and
leave
the
house
early
to
catch
the
eight
train
he
usually
made
use
of
the
short
cut
through
garden
and
the
cinder
path
beside
the
and
in
this
brisk
walk
with
the
blood
of
youth
running
happily
in
his
veins
he
would
catch
a
little
of
the
exhilarating
atmosphere
of
early
morning
in
the
country
when
the
frosts
began
as
they
do
early
on
that
high
plateau
the
morning
air
seemed
stronger
and
more
bracing
than
ever
circumstance
in
a
little
more
than
three
months
had
exalted
him
to
the
state
of
those
metropolitan
holders
whose
majesty
he
had
disturbed
on
the
day
when
he
left
for
good
he
was
now
in
a
position
to
appreciate
their
exclusiveness
and
to
look
upon
all
chance
people
who
intruded
on
the
privacies
of
the
eight
train
with
the
same
mingled
curiosity
and
contempt
in
every
way
a
season
ticket
in
its
cover
of
dark
blue
morocco
was
a
thing
superior
to
the
transitory
and
ignoble
pasteboard
he
could
hardly
resist
a
sigh
of
bored
superiority
on
the
first
occasion
when
he
produced
it
he
travelled
thus
rising
to
the
highest
level
of
luxury
in
travelling
permitted
to
any
inhabitants
of
halesby
unless
it
were
the
local
baronet
or
willis
of
mawne
whom
even
sir
joseph
hingston
could
not
outdo
most
of
the
other
holders
travelled
second
and
in
this
way
by
making
a
habit
of
taking
his
place
in
the
same
carriage
for
sentimental
reasons
one
that
contained
a
series
of
pictures
edwin
began
to
be
on
speaking
terms
with
many
members
of
this
select
company
they
included
a
youth
articled
to
a
solicitor
in
north
bromwich
the
son
of
a
halesby
postmaster
who
was
inclined
to
establish
terms
of
familiarity
a
gentleman
with
a
bloated
complexion
and
a
bowler
hat
reputed
to
be
a
commercial
traveller
who
carried
a
bag
in
which
samples
may
well
have
been
hidden
a
superior
person
with
a
gruff
voice
who
was
a
clerk
in
a
bank
in
the
city
and
on
saturdays
carried
a
brown
canvas
bag
and
a
hockey
stick
and
a
withered
man
of
fifty
who
travelled
into
north
bromwich
daily
on
some
business
connected
with
brass
and
on
damp
mornings
exhibited
evidences
of
an
asthmatic
complaint
that
aroused
budding
professional
interest
it
was
he
who
first
admitted
edwin
to
the
conversation
of
the
compartment
by
confessing
to
him
that
he
had
been
the
despair
of
doctors
since
childhood
that
three
specialists
had
assured
his
mother
that
she
would
never
rear
that
boy
that
in
spite
of
this
he
had
always
paid
four
times
as
much
in
bills
as
in
that
in
his
belief
they
only
kept
him
alive
for
what
they
could
get
out
of
him
and
that
his
life
had
been
an
unending
misery
as
harrowing
upon
his
word
as
that
of
any
of
the
sufferers
who
were
illustrated
in
the
papers
holding
their
backs
with
kidney
complaint
until
his
missus
had
said
throw
any
more
money
away
on
these
doctors
john
have
a
talk
with
ingleby
and
with
the
aid
of
asthma
cure
he
had
become
relatively
whole
evidently
he
knew
who
edwin
was
do
you
think
of
that
now
he
wheezed
and
covered
the
embarrassment
into
which
edwin
was
immediately
thrown
by
not
waiting
for
his
reply
and
continuing
suppose
now
be
learning
to
be
a
chemist
like
your
father
a
medical
student
going
to
be
a
be
damned
said
the
asthmatical
person
he
did
not
say
why
but
the
looks
of
the
superior
bank
clerk
who
immediately
lowered
his
paper
and
stared
at
edwin
as
though
it
were
his
duty
to
decide
whether
edwin
were
a
fit
person
to
enter
a
learned
profession
or
not
and
then
contemptuously
went
on
with
his
reading
supplied
the
kind
of
commentary
that
might
have
been
intended
when
the
asthmatical
subject
said
that
he
was
damned
the
gentleman
with
the
bloated
complexion
and
the
bowler
who
always
opened
his
morning
paper
with
fingers
that
trembled
either
with
excitement
or
as
a
result
of
the
night
before
at
the
column
headed
turf
topics
gave
a
snigger
and
spat
on
the
floor
to
conceal
it
and
the
articled
clerk
at
this
display
of
ill
breeding
turned
up
his
nose
it
was
a
strange
little
company
that
assembled
in
the
smoker
every
morning
and
the
strangest
part
of
it
to
edwin
was
the
fact
that
each
of
them
entrenched
as
it
were
behind
his
morning
paper
affected
a
frigid
disinterest
yet
eagerly
listened
to
the
conversation
and
eagerly
scrutinised
the
appearance
of
the
others
all
of
them
had
their
little
fixed
habits
in
one
place
they
put
their
gloves
in
another
their
umbrellas
every
morning
they
began
to
read
their
papers
at
the
same
column
and
folded
them
at
the
same
point
in
the
journey
they
seemed
just
as
regular
in
their
habits
as
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
in
which
they
travelled
revolving
and
stopping
and
shunting
and
being
braked
at
an
identical
time
and
place
for
six
days
out
of
the
seven
when
he
had
tumbled
to
this
edwin
found
that
the
whole
of
the
main
line
train
that
he
caught
every
morning
at
the
junction
was
occupied
by
perhaps
a
hundred
grouped
units
of
the
same
kind
it
amused
him
to
sample
them
and
when
one
appealed
to
him
he
would
become
a
member
of
it
for
a
time
and
see
what
he
could
make
of
it
naturally
there
were
more
interesting
people
on
the
main
line
than
on
the
halesby
branch
and
in
the
end
he
himself
became
such
a
familiar
figure
on
the
from
the
junction
that
he
could
say
to
nearly
every
group
of
seasons
on
the
train
he
was
even
taken
to
the
heart
of
the
superior
bank
clerk
in
the
halesby
carriage
indeed
he
knew
every
one
of
them
finding
them
human
people
who
in
the
manner
of
the
englishman
and
the
hedgehog
had
put
out
their
protective
spikes
upon
a
first
acquaintance
the
only
halesby
traveller
of
whom
he
could
make
nothing
was
the
bloated
person
in
the
bowler
who
began
the
morning
with
turf
topics
and
then
proceeded
to
suck
a
copying
pencil
till
his
lips
were
the
colour
of
his
cheeks
and
thus
inspired
to
underline
the
names
of
a
number
of
horses
in
the
programme
apart
from
his
habit
of
spitting
on
the
floor
a
custom
which
probably
saved
the
poor
man
from
death
by
poisoning
with
copying
ink
he
was
inoffensive
edwin
was
even
sorry
for
him
sometimes
when
he
saw
him
hung
up
over
his
forecasts
then
he
would
tilt
the
bowler
on
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
scratch
his
head
under
the
sandy
fringe
of
hair
edwin
was
sorry
because
with
a
head
like
that
it
must
have
been
so
difficult
to
forecast
anything
he
did
not
see
many
women
on
the
morning
train
in
those
days
female
enterprise
was
a
good
deal
checked
by
conventions
that
died
more
slowly
in
the
midland
plain
than
elsewhere
from
halesby
itself
there
were
only
four
holders
of
the
opposite
sex
two
of
them
were
employed
in
the
same
large
drapery
establishment
in
queen
street
and
were
excessively
ladylike
and
careful
in
all
their
behaviour
edwin
had
never
spoke
to
either
of
them
but
he
discovered
in
both
an
identical
physical
state
that
peculiar
greenish
waxen
pallor
that
appears
to
be
the
inevitable
result
of
serving
in
a
shop
the
black
dresses
on
which
their
employers
insisted
heightened
this
effect
of
fragility
and
on
mornings
when
tiredness
had
made
them
start
too
late
for
the
train
so
that
they
had
to
hurry
over
the
last
hundred
yards
edwin
would
notice
how
they
panted
for
breath
within
their
elegant
corsets
and
how
faint
was
the
flush
that
came
into
their
cheeks
he
felt
a
little
sorry
for
them
but
they
were
not
in
the
least
sorry
for
themselves
in
halesby
their
employment
at
a
monstrous
drapery
store
gave
them
a
position
of
unusual
distinction
as
arbiters
of
feminine
fashions
and
they
would
not
have
exchanged
their
distinguished
anæmia
for
any
other
calling
under
the
sun
in
their
profession
this
toxic
pallor
as
of
blanched
in
a
cellar
was
regarded
as
an
asset
it
was
considered
french
and
did
not
their
shortness
of
breath
upon
the
least
exertion
or
emotion
cause
their
bosoms
to
rise
and
fall
like
those
of
the
heroines
of
the
serial
fiction
that
they
read
when
they
were
not
too
tired
in
the
train
edwin
was
not
attracted
by
them
any
more
than
by
the
other
couple
a
pair
of
pupil
teachers
from
an
elementary
school
in
one
of
the
northern
suburbs
who
also
dressed
for
the
part
that
they
were
fulfilling
in
life
and
wore
spectacles
as
tokens
of
their
studiousness
the
instinct
of
sex
had
as
yet
scarcely
asserted
itself
in
him
he
was
a
little
curious
about
it
and
that
was
all
subconsciously
perhaps
it
found
expression
in
his
anxieties
about
his
personal
appearance
he
was
beginning
to
take
a
considerable
interest
in
what
should
or
should
not
be
worn
treating
it
more
as
a
matter
of
abstract
science
than
as
one
of
practical
politics
for
he
had
few
clothes
beyond
those
in
which
he
had
left
and
was
not
likely
to
have
any
opportunity
of
extending
his
wardrobe
until
these
were
worn
out
in
those
days
the
weekly
called
had
reached
its
most
vigorous
phase
and
a
column
headed
masculine
modes
was
a
matter
of
earnest
consideration
to
edwin
every
thursday
when
the
paper
appeared
in
the
spring
he
decided
he
would
buy
an
overcoat
with
raglan
sleeves
the
weekly
authority
who
styled
himself
major
was
dead
nuts
on
raglan
sleeves
beneath
this
fashionable
covering
interior
defects
would
be
well
hidden
and
given
a
natty
red
tie
said
the
major
with
the
indispensable
blue
serge
reefer
suit
and
a
bowler
hat
with
a
curly
but
not
too
curly
brim
he
should
be
able
to
compete
with
the
burly
bank
clerk
as
cynosure
for
the
eyes
of
the
pale
young
ladies
in
the
and
a
spectacle
of
awe
for
the
studious
ii
edwin
soon
became
absorbed
in
the
routine
of
the
first
year
life
and
had
very
little
time
to
think
about
anything
else
he
had
to
work
hard
to
keep
pace
with
it
and
the
realisation
of
this
was
a
striking
lesson
to
him
at
he
had
found
that
his
advance
in
knowledge
made
the
work
progressively
more
easy
here
he
was
breaking
new
ground
from
the
beginning
acquiring
knowledge
of
a
kind
that
owed
nothing
to
general
culture
and
came
to
him
none
the
easier
for
his
possession
of
it
the
only
things
in
his
new
work
that
seemed
easy
and
logical
to
him
were
those
scientific
names
that
were
derived
from
latin
and
greek
otherwise
the
very
rudiments
and
nature
of
the
subjects
were
new
to
him
the
most
astonishing
part
of
the
whole
business
was
the
way
in
which
the
formidable
assembly
that
had
glared
at
him
as
he
imagined
outside
the
office
simplified
itself
he
had
been
prepared
to
find
them
creatures
of
a
different
tissue
from
himself
and
particularly
such
apparitions
as
harrop
and
the
immense
brown
he
soon
saw
that
as
far
as
the
career
of
medicine
was
concerned
they
were
identically
in
the
same
box
as
himself
that
neither
knowledge
of
the
world
nor
elegance
of
attire
could
help
either
of
them
to
acquire
the
absolute
knowledge
that
was
the
one
thing
essential
to
success
it
made
no
matter
that
these
two
approached
the
same
problem
from
essentially
different
angles
brown
with
his
earnest
brows
knitted
and
a
look
of
indomitable
but
baffled
determination
harrop
as
though
the
issue
really
matter
as
long
as
the
crease
in
his
trousers
was
in
the
right
place
but
in
either
case
edwin
saw
that
they
had
to
work
as
hard
or
harder
than
he
did
his
first
acquaintance
martin
who
was
now
becoming
his
friend
since
the
work
that
they
shared
in
common
bridged
the
social
gulf
of
which
edwin
alone
was
aware
seemed
to
possess
the
faculty
of
doing
things
and
learning
facts
almost
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
not
in
any
way
brilliant
but
he
had
a
way
with
him
and
a
certain
shrewdness
that
not
infrequently
underlies
the
superficial
indolence
of
the
celt
above
all
things
edwin
found
him
good
company
for
the
picturesqueness
of
his
brogue
and
a
sense
of
humour
not
of
the
verbal
kind
in
which
edwin
himself
dealt
but
the
broader
humour
that
arises
from
situations
and
personal
characteristics
made
his
society
a
peculiar
joy
at
the
first
lecture
on
chemistry
a
dull
dissertation
on
first
principles
edwin
had
gravitated
to
the
seat
next
to
him
and
for
the
rest
of
the
term
they
kept
the
same
places
and
afterwards
compared
notes
edwin
help
liking
him
even
though
he
was
conscious
of
the
radical
social
misunderstanding
that
underlay
their
friendship
the
technical
sciences
of
chemistry
and
physics
made
no
strong
appeal
to
edwin
they
seemed
to
him
matters
of
empirical
knowledge
that
must
be
acquired
according
to
schedule
but
would
have
very
little
connection
with
the
work
of
his
profession
and
he
found
them
too
near
to
the
desperate
subject
of
mathematics
to
be
congenial
he
could
find
nothing
romantic
or
human
in
them
and
this
fact
in
itself
is
a
sufficient
indictment
of
the
way
in
which
they
were
taught
anatomy
was
another
matter
altogether
he
had
anticipated
the
beginning
of
this
study
with
a
feeling
in
which
awe
and
an
instinctive
distaste
were
mingled
from
the
first
day
he
had
known
that
somewhere
up
at
the
top
of
the
building
lay
the
dissecting
room
a
place
that
his
fancy
painted
as
a
kind
of
chamber
of
horrors
on
his
way
to
the
theatre
in
which
the
dean
lectured
on
anatomy
with
a
scholarly
refinement
of
phrase
that
transcended
the
natural
elegance
of
martin
and
a
fascinating
collection
of
coloured
chalks
he
had
passed
the
gloomy
door
and
seen
a
blackboard
on
which
the
names
of
the
prosectors
were
recorded
in
white
lettering
but
he
preferred
not
to
look
inside
martin
to
whom
all
adventures
came
more
easily
settled
the
point
for
him
say
he
said
immediately
after
the
lecture
you
put
yourself
down
for
a
part
part
what
do
you
mean
dissecting
shared
between
two
you
know
in
the
first
term
supposed
to
do
an
upper
or
a
lower
suppose
we
go
shares
in
right
said
edwin
shall
it
be
i
think
an
upper
will
be
better
less
fat
and
mess
about
it
better
go
and
choose
one
along
martin
opened
the
door
of
the
dissecting
room
and
held
it
while
edwin
entered
it
was
a
long
irregular
chamber
with
a
low
glass
roof
and
an
asphalt
floor
first
impression
was
one
of
light
and
space
the
second
of
a
penetrating
odour
unlike
anything
that
he
had
smelt
before
he
could
not
give
a
name
to
it
and
indeed
it
was
complex
being
compact
of
a
pungent
unknown
antiseptic
and
another
fainter
smell
that
was
in
fact
that
of
ancient
mortality
the
effect
of
the
whole
was
strange
but
not
nauseating
as
he
would
have
expected
all
down
the
room
at
short
intervals
long
zinc
tables
with
a
tin
bucket
at
the
head
of
each
were
ranged
most
of
the
tables
were
empty
but
on
four
or
five
of
them
were
either
displayed
or
lay
draped
in
coarse
unbleached
calico
one
or
two
of
them
sprawled
on
their
faces
but
most
of
them
being
as
yet
unappropriated
were
supported
under
their
backs
by
small
metal
platforms
from
which
the
heads
rolled
back
and
the
limbs
were
stretched
out
in
a
posture
of
extreme
but
petrified
agony
to
eyes
it
was
a
lamentable
and
terrible
sight
he
wondered
by
what
chain
of
degradations
the
body
of
a
man
who
had
lived
and
known
the
youth
and
pride
of
body
that
he
himself
possessed
who
had
experienced
aspirations
and
dreams
and
hope
and
love
should
descend
to
this
final
indignity
he
stood
still
he
did
not
dare
for
the
moment
to
come
nearer
do
they
get
here
he
asked
martin
paupers
you
know
old
men
and
women
most
of
them
who
die
in
the
workhouses
and
are
not
claimed
by
their
relatives
instead
of
burying
them
they
send
them
along
here
the
anatomy
porters
collect
them
then
pickled
for
so
long
in
a
kind
of
vat
in
the
cellars
of
this
place
and
they
inject
them
with
arsenic
to
preserve
them
and
pump
red
paint
into
their
arteries
so
that
easier
to
dissect
i
like
the
job
myself
but
i
suppose
the
porters
are
used
to
it
you
get
used
to
anything
you
know
besides
they
a
bit
like
they
are
when
first
dead
i
think
the
chap
for
us
i
had
a
look
at
him
the
other
day
always
better
to
choose
an
old
one
the
muscles
are
cleaner
less
they
approached
the
second
table
the
subject
was
an
old
and
withered
man
his
grey
hair
was
shaven
and
his
mouth
hung
open
showing
that
he
had
lost
his
teeth
martin
had
been
quite
right
he
look
in
the
least
like
a
dead
man
he
did
not
look
like
a
man
at
all
only
a
pathetic
tanned
skeleton
with
sinews
and
toughened
skin
a
dried
mummy
from
which
all
the
contours
of
humanity
had
shrunk
away
it
so
bad
after
all
the
picture
that
imagination
had
anticipated
that
of
a
crude
and
horrible
human
shambles
was
not
here
no
the
idea
of
humanity
was
too
remote
to
be
in
the
least
insistent
for
a
moment
in
spite
of
this
consolation
edwin
went
pale
martin
noticed
it
say
this
going
to
turn
you
up
is
it
all
right
i
was
only
said
martin
with
a
laugh
do
too
much
of
that
if
i
were
you
better
make
a
start
on
the
right
upper
put
our
names
he
turned
towards
the
glass
case
in
which
hung
notices
of
lectures
and
the
printed
cards
on
which
the
names
of
dissectors
were
recorded
and
while
he
did
so
edwin
still
stood
thinking
he
thought
was
this
really
a
man
who
had
lived
and
breathed
and
aged
and
suffered
where
had
he
been
born
how
long
ago
had
he
ever
loved
had
he
ever
married
had
he
ever
wondered
what
the
future
would
bring
to
him
surely
his
fancies
had
never
envisaged
this
perhaps
he
had
been
born
in
some
remote
hamlet
of
the
marches
some
sweet
smelling
village
like
far
forest
from
which
the
iron
tentacles
of
the
city
had
drawn
him
inwards
and
sapped
his
life
leaving
in
the
end
this
dry
shell
like
the
sucked
carcass
of
a
fly
blowing
in
a
web
if
this
were
the
end
of
poverty
and
desolation
what
a
terrible
thing
poverty
must
be
did
the
poor
and
the
outcast
ever
dream
that
they
might
come
to
this
and
yet
after
all
what
did
it
matter
he
awoke
from
his
dream
it
was
evident
that
he
was
the
only
dreamer
in
that
long
room
at
many
of
the
other
tables
second
year
men
were
sitting
quietly
dissecting
or
gossiping
or
thumbing
manuals
of
practical
anatomy
yellow
with
human
grease
it
amazed
him
that
men
should
be
able
to
joke
and
smoke
their
pipes
and
appear
to
be
contented
in
such
an
atmosphere
but
the
wisdom
of
phrase
returned
to
him
get
used
to
anything
you
among
the
dissectors
already
at
work
in
their
white
overalls
he
saw
the
ponderous
frame
of
the
man
called
brown
he
at
any
rate
was
not
letting
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
already
he
was
engaged
in
reflecting
the
skin
from
the
on
which
he
was
working
his
clumsy
hands
found
the
work
difficult
as
was
shown
by
the
anxiety
of
his
partner
an
immaculate
smooth
young
man
whom
edwin
already
knew
by
the
name
of
maskew
dressed
in
the
indispensable
navy
serge
reefer
with
the
correct
red
tie
and
a
big
orchid
in
his
buttonhole
he
took
an
elaborate
meerschaum
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
protest
lord
brown
another
cutaneous
nerve
gone
phut
do
be
careful
and
brown
with
an
exaggerated
earnestness
say
old
man
i
am
sorry
i
simply
use
the
damned
things
do
you
mean
to
say
a
nerve
he
held
up
in
his
forceps
a
tiny
white
filament
of
tissue
said
maskew
returning
to
his
pipe
of
the
great
gluteal
listen
to
what
cunningham
says
buttock
is
liberally
supplied
with
cutaneous
nerves
a
fact
much
appreciated
by
brown
scratched
his
head
with
the
handle
of
his
scalpel
in
an
absolute
fog
better
take
this
job
on
and
do
the
reading
what
does
mean
anyway
thought
edwin
after
all
it
seemed
the
dead
languages
had
their
uses
by
this
time
he
had
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
his
distaste
he
was
getting
used
to
the
odour
of
the
room
and
so
a
moment
later
he
and
martin
strolled
over
to
a
table
at
which
one
of
the
prosectors
was
engaged
in
preparing
a
specimen
for
the
lectures
it
was
almost
pleasant
to
watch
the
deftness
with
which
he
defined
the
line
of
a
pink
injected
artery
wielding
his
scalpel
as
delicately
and
as
surely
as
a
painter
at
work
on
a
canvas
they
watched
him
working
in
silence
part
it
he
said
with
condescension
said
martin
sort
of
thing
must
be
rattling
good
practice
for
quite
different
said
the
prosector
is
a
lazy
job
no
hurry
about
it
this
fellow
bleed
to
so
edwin
and
denis
martin
began
to
work
on
their
upper
and
the
dissecting
room
that
had
been
an
abode
of
horror
and
an
incentive
to
philosophy
became
no
more
than
the
scene
of
their
daily
labours
edwin
accepted
his
new
callousness
without
regret
for
the
sensitive
perceptions
that
he
had
lost
for
he
saw
that
his
heart
and
his
imagination
were
not
really
less
tender
for
the
change
they
had
merely
come
to
a
working
agreement
with
the
demands
of
his
new
life
and
had
attained
this
satisfactory
state
not
so
much
by
a
suppression
of
sensibility
as
by
an
insistence
on
the
objective
aspects
of
his
work
this
fact
explained
to
him
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
career
the
fallacy
of
medical
callousness
in
relation
to
pain
or
physical
distress
he
saw
on
reflection
that
if
a
doctor
exaggerated
the
importance
of
subjective
sensations
in
his
patient
he
might
well
lose
sight
of
his
own
object
which
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
removing
their
cause
that
for
example
the
fear
of
death
the
anxiety
of
relatives
and
the
own
perception
of
intolerable
pain
were
of
infinitely
less
importance
to
the
physician
than
the
presence
of
a
focus
of
danger
in
the
appendix
a
sustained
objectivity
was
the
only
attitude
of
mind
in
which
a
doctor
could
live
at
the
same
time
happily
and
efficiently
the
only
feature
of
the
dissecting
room
that
now
seemed
objectionable
was
the
smell
of
the
powerful
antiseptic
that
was
used
for
preserving
the
subjects
for
a
week
or
two
edwin
was
conscious
of
its
pervading
every
moment
of
his
life
his
his
even
his
sleep
but
in
a
little
time
his
olfactory
nerves
became
so
used
to
it
that
they
discounted
its
presence
and
the
fact
that
his
neighbours
in
railway
carriages
did
not
seem
to
shrink
from
him
convinced
him
that
after
all
he
did
not
go
about
the
world
saturated
in
odours
of
the
charnel
house
the
winter
term
went
on
and
to
the
sense
of
hurry
and
frustration
that
had
embarrassed
him
at
first
and
found
its
perfect
expression
in
the
knitted
brows
of
the
monstrous
brown
succeeded
an
atmosphere
of
leisure
and
method
and
ease
edwin
had
time
for
other
things
than
work
he
began
to
know
the
men
of
his
year
and
to
discover
that
even
the
most
formidable
of
them
half
as
formidable
as
they
had
seemed
harrop
indeed
was
still
a
little
remote
after
the
spaciousness
of
oriel
where
he
had
devoted
a
couple
of
years
to
a
liberal
education
in
which
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
was
of
less
importance
than
the
acquisition
of
style
north
bromwich
with
its
concentration
on
the
virtues
rather
than
the
graces
of
life
and
the
very
questionable
sartorial
shapes
that
inhabited
it
naturally
seemed
a
little
cheap
but
in
a
little
time
even
harrop
became
modified
and
humble
if
a
little
contemptuous
and
the
most
resplendent
of
his
waistcoats
retained
no
more
significance
than
the
oriflamme
of
a
lost
cause
brown
was
the
more
approachable
of
the
two
and
for
brown
edwin
soon
conceived
something
that
was
very
nearly
an
affection
with
his
impressive
physique
and
his
experience
of
a
rough
world
in
which
edwin
had
never
moved
was
mingled
a
childlike
enthusiasm
for
his
new
work
a
rich
blundering
good
humour
and
great
generosity
he
was
not
clever
and
showed
an
intense
admiration
for
better
heads
than
his
own
but
for
all
that
he
was
much
more
intelligent
than
he
looked
and
to
edwin
his
enthusiasm
and
earnestness
were
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
his
intellectual
attainments
once
or
twice
wandering
into
the
anatomical
museum
he
had
come
upon
brown
standing
rapt
in
front
of
a
specimen
dissection
or
quietly
sweating
up
bones
with
a
open
before
him
and
he
had
sung
out
to
edwin
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
of
his
own
age
and
they
had
put
in
an
hour
of
work
together
know
a
lot
quicker
than
i
am
said
brown
suppose
it
comes
of
being
decently
educated
i
expect
that
when
you
were
learning
latin
and
greek
i
was
knocking
about
the
world
making
a
damn
fool
of
then
they
would
light
their
pipes
the
dissecting
room
had
made
smoking
necessary
to
edwin
and
brown
would
yarn
on
for
half
an
hour
about
his
romantic
adventures
his
bitter
quarrels
with
his
people
the
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
in
paris
when
he
went
there
to
play
football
for
the
midlands
in
all
of
which
the
passionate
headstrong
obstinate
and
withal
lovable
nature
of
the
big
fellow
would
appear
expect
it
all
sounds
to
you
like
a
rotten
waste
of
time
mucking
about
with
my
life
like
this
he
said
you
know
not
at
all
sorry
had
i
take
up
this
doctoring
business
in
a
hurry
without
thinking
about
it
i
thrashed
the
matter
out
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
good
human
sort
of
game
a
sort
of
chance
of
pulling
people
out
of
the
rotten
messes
of
one
kind
or
another
that
they
get
themselves
no
fault
of
their
own
poor
devils
just
because
made
like
you
and
me
and
the
rest
of
us
if
you
go
on
the
bust
or
knock
about
the
country
with
a
football
team
on
tour
or
go
on
the
tramp
and
sleep
in
a
hedge
or
a
barn
or
a
rowton
house
as
i
did
when
i
had
the
last
with
the
old
man
you
rub
against
a
lot
of
people
all
just
the
same
as
yourself
you
know
you
can
see
yourself
in
the
best
of
them
as
well
as
the
worst
and
taking
them
all
round
all
damned
good
at
the
bottom
all
got
to
fight
out
their
own
way
in
life
with
their
heads
or
their
fists
or
their
feet
and
the
only
chap
that
can
really
help
them
in
it
is
a
doctor
the
conclusion
come
to
god
scarcely
believe
it
but
once
i
was
converted
i
know
damn
funny
but
a
fact
that
when
i
was
a
youngster
and
had
been
on
the
periodical
bust
a
revivalist
chap
got
hold
of
me
and
persuaded
me
that
i
was
saved
a
funny
sort
of
feeling
i
can
tell
you
i
thought
i
was
going
off
my
nut
until
i
went
to
see
a
doctor
and
he
put
my
liver
right
a
fine
humane
game
ingleby
you
can
take
it
from
but
i
can
tell
you
with
one
thing
and
another
got
my
work
cut
he
shook
his
head
seriously
and
the
puzzled
dogged
expression
of
frustrate
determination
that
edwin
knew
so
well
came
into
his
eyes
wasting
time
my
son
he
said
get
on
with
the
blasted
humerus
now
what
is
the
origin
of
the
supinator
longus
come
on
on
one
of
these
pleasant
occasions
he
confided
to
edwin
the
reason
why
he
had
his
work
cut
out
his
father
a
stern
calvinistic
methodist
had
finally
washed
his
hands
of
him
been
a
bit
of
a
rolling
stone
you
see
said
brown
you
blame
the
poor
old
fellow
so
he
just
planked
down
six
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
one
day
and
told
me
that
i
could
do
what
i
liked
with
it
but
that
was
the
last
i
should
get
from
him
it
suited
me
down
to
the
ground
i
much
care
what
became
of
me
then
it
was
a
couple
of
years
ago
so
i
had
a
royal
bust
a
sort
of
glorious
windup
to
the
season
and
then
sat
down
to
think
i
had
just
five
hundred
left
and
so
i
had
to
think
what
the
devil
i
was
going
to
do
with
it
and
my
prospects
seemed
so
putridly
rotten
that
the
only
thing
i
could
do
was
to
go
on
the
bust
again
i
enjoy
it
much
that
time
jaded
palate
you
but
i
had
a
bit
of
luck
i
met
a
trainer
fellow
in
the
leicester
lounge
with
a
couple
of
women
and
he
put
me
on
to
a
double
for
the
lincoln
and
national
no
use
for
if
it
was
the
owners
that
were
racing
be
a
vestige
of
sport
in
it
but
it
always
seems
to
me
a
shame
that
decent
clean
creatures
like
horses
should
make
a
living
for
a
lot
of
dirty
stiffs
out
of
the
ruin
of
working
men
and
small
shopkeepers
still
i
dreamed
about
this
double
and
as
a
weak
superstitious
sort
of
chap
i
put
a
tenner
on
it
the
first
and
the
last
bet
ever
had
on
a
horse
but
the
thing
happened
to
come
off
and
last
spring
i
found
myself
with
twelve
hundred
pounds
instead
of
so
i
began
to
think
it
out
i
remembered
that
doctor
fellow
who
cured
me
of
being
converted
and
i
thought
gad
be
a
a
five
course
well
not
particularly
brilliant
at
the
top
end
and
so
i
allowed
six
six
into
twelve
goes
twice
two
hundred
a
year
for
fees
and
living
and
recreation
you
see
pretty
tight
come
along
and
have
some
lunch
at
iii
they
went
downstairs
to
the
where
the
porter
was
now
a
familiar
of
it
had
been
decided
that
it
would
not
be
becoming
for
a
really
modern
university
like
that
of
north
bromwich
to
impose
the
sight
of
such
an
anachronism
as
academic
dress
on
the
streets
a
rule
that
had
been
something
of
a
disappointment
to
edwin
and
so
they
left
their
gowns
behind
was
an
institution
of
some
antiquity
opposite
to
the
corinthian
with
which
brown
had
been
acquainted
in
his
unregenerate
days
it
was
a
long
and
noisy
bar
at
which
for
the
sum
of
fourpence
one
consumed
a
quarter
of
the
top
of
a
cottage
loaf
a
tangle
of
watercress
a
hunk
of
cheddar
cheese
and
a
tankard
of
beer
this
combination
of
excellences
was
known
as
a
and
bitter
and
it
was
eaten
standing
at
the
counter
edwin
was
gradually
becoming
a
regular
customer
at
this
place
for
delicate
fancy
for
plovers
on
toast
and
other
such
refinements
had
proved
too
expensive
for
him
and
apart
from
their
joint
labours
in
the
they
were
beginning
to
see
less
of
each
from
any
on
the
part
of
either
but
simply
because
position
in
the
house
of
the
old
lady
in
alvaston
whose
house
was
full
of
animals
had
introduced
him
to
the
social
life
of
that
elegant
suburb
in
which
so
perfect
a
carpet
knight
was
bound
to
shine
and
social
engagements
with
encouraging
matrons
and
innumerable
eligible
daughters
were
becoming
so
pressing
that
his
acquaintance
with
the
black
heart
of
the
city
was
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
casual
for
this
reason
apart
from
his
natural
inclination
edwin
was
thrown
into
daily
contact
with
brown
and
his
partner
maskew
maskew
was
a
more
typical
product
of
the
midlands
his
home
and
all
his
upbringing
had
lain
in
one
of
the
great
black
towns
that
cluster
like
swollen
knots
upon
the
north
bromwich
system
of
railways
he
had
never
lived
in
the
country
he
did
not
even
know
what
country
was
and
his
distinctive
if
provincial
urbanity
showed
itself
in
a
hundred
his
dress
that
was
a
little
too
smart
in
his
speech
that
was
not
quite
smart
enough
in
a
certain
lack
of
fresh
air
in
his
mental
atmosphere
his
people
were
wealthy
and
his
tastes
without
emulating
the
style
of
harrop
were
expensive
he
was
handsome
and
if
his
hair
had
been
shorter
and
not
so
mathematically
correct
he
would
have
been
handsomer
still
he
was
intensely
interested
in
women
and
a
great
retailer
of
rabelaisian
stories
he
wore
buttoned
boots
and
was
very
nearly
a
billiard
player
a
more
unusual
combination
than
his
partnership
with
the
abrupt
and
unsubtle
brown
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
but
even
in
his
undoubted
cleverness
his
nature
was
complimentary
and
edwin
found
himself
happy
in
the
society
of
both
in
their
company
he
became
a
habitué
of
the
dousita
café
a
subterranean
privacy
in
which
excellent
coffee
was
served
in
the
most
comfortable
surroundings
by
young
ladies
whose
charms
had
already
made
something
of
a
sensation
in
that
decorous
city
maskew
naturally
knew
them
all
by
their
christian
names
and
treated
them
with
a
familiar
badinage
that
impressed
edwin
mildly
ambitious
but
quite
incapable
of
imitation
by
the
ease
with
which
it
was
performed
the
cushioned
seats
and
the
mild
stimulus
of
the
coffee
and
cigarettes
would
even
rouse
the
massive
brown
to
a
ponderous
levity
by
which
the
lady
of
their
choice
a
certain
miss
wheeler
whose
uncle
maskew
seriously
confided
to
edwin
was
a
bishop
was
obviously
flattered
edwin
could
understand
any
woman
being
attracted
by
brown
or
rather
as
the
need
of
a
distinction
had
by
this
time
made
his
familiar
name
it
also
pleased
him
to
see
the
way
in
which
went
red
in
his
bull
neck
on
a
certain
occasion
when
maskew
had
delicately
overstepped
the
limits
of
good
taste
in
his
conversation
with
miss
wheeler
but
the
niece
of
the
bishop
did
not
in
the
intervals
between
lectures
they
would
congregate
in
their
gowns
in
a
dismal
chamber
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
cramped
building
that
was
called
the
common
room
drinking
tea
and
eating
biscuits
this
place
was
frequented
not
only
by
members
of
the
medical
school
but
by
students
of
other
faculties
whom
edwin
regarded
with
some
contempt
one
afternoon
on
entering
this
room
edwin
found
holding
forth
with
some
indignation
before
a
notice
that
had
been
pinned
on
the
board
asking
for
a
list
of
freshmen
who
were
anxious
to
play
rugby
football
during
the
present
season
so
far
only
five
or
six
names
had
appeared
naturally
enough
came
first
for
his
prowess
in
the
game
was
well
known
in
the
north
bromwich
district
it
a
damnable
thing
he
said
indignantly
a
school
of
this
size
to
see
a
measly
list
like
that
can
stick
mine
down
said
edwin
as
a
matter
of
form
my
son
though
i
see
what
good
likely
to
be
to
the
club
except
to
give
it
play
soccer
said
maskew
would
said
gentlemanly
all
beef
put
in
edwin
said
the
team
wants
weight
and
this
place
is
simply
thick
with
great
hefty
science
men
and
brewers
never
known
the
meaning
of
a
healthy
sweat
in
their
lives
upon
my
word
it
sickens
me
look
at
that
he
pointed
to
a
corner
in
which
a
big
fellow
lay
huddled
up
in
a
deep
basket
chair
he
had
shoulders
that
would
have
appeared
massive
by
the
side
of
any
others
but
a
fair
wide
face
marked
with
freckles
a
sandy
moustache
and
crisp
curly
red
hair
the
kind
of
swine
that
ought
to
be
working
in
the
edwin
looked
and
as
he
did
so
instinctively
went
pale
a
curious
survival
of
the
instinct
of
physical
fear
had
shaken
him
it
was
ridiculous
know
that
chap
he
said
in
an
way
no
good
i
was
at
school
with
him
got
a
weak
heart
his
chapter
iii
carnival
i
christmas
came
an
christmas
with
hoar
frost
on
the
fields
and
hard
roads
gleaming
with
splintered
light
reflected
from
a
frosty
sky
in
this
raiment
of
frozen
moisture
even
the
black
desert
of
morning
pilgrimage
appeared
fantastically
beautiful
the
vacation
did
not
suspend
his
work
for
though
no
lectures
were
given
the
dissecting
room
was
still
open
and
here
on
icy
mornings
when
the
asphalt
floor
was
as
cold
as
the
glass
roof
he
would
freeze
for
an
hour
at
a
time
watching
brown
and
maskew
at
work
martin
having
been
whisked
off
to
spend
a
baronial
christmas
of
scratch
dances
in
ireland
a
few
months
in
north
bromwich
had
made
a
great
change
in
edwin
he
had
lost
much
of
his
old
timidity
shaved
twice
a
week
smoked
the
plug
tobacco
to
which
brown
had
introduced
him
and
was
no
longer
shy
with
any
creature
on
earth
of
his
own
sex
with
women
it
was
ease
and
familiarity
with
this
baffling
sex
would
come
no
doubt
in
time
but
for
the
present
one
or
two
desperate
essays
at
conversation
with
the
elegant
miss
wheeler
in
the
absence
of
his
friends
had
been
failures
and
miss
wheeler
was
not
the
least
approachable
of
her
sex
there
were
several
women
medical
students
in
his
year
but
in
their
case
he
had
not
felt
the
incentive
to
gallantry
that
the
softer
charms
of
miss
wheeler
suggested
even
if
they
had
not
insulated
themselves
with
shapeless
djibbehs
of
russet
brown
and
bunched
back
their
hair
in
a
manner
ruthlessly
unfeminine
the
common
study
of
a
subject
so
grossly
material
as
anatomy
would
have
rubbed
the
bloom
from
any
budding
romance
in
the
biological
laboratory
however
he
found
a
figure
that
exercised
a
peculiar
attraction
on
him
she
was
an
american
girl
a
science
student
who
with
the
severity
of
the
medical
dress
contrived
to
combine
an
atmosphere
of
yielding
femininity
she
had
a
soft
voice
for
the
tones
of
which
edwin
would
listen
big
eyes
soft
dark
hair
and
very
beautiful
arms
that
her
dark
overalls
displayed
to
perfection
edwin
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
define
the
way
in
which
she
attracted
him
certainly
he
cherish
any
definite
romantic
ideas
about
her
but
he
did
find
her
in
some
subtle
way
disturbing
so
that
he
would
be
conscious
of
her
presence
when
she
came
into
the
lab
surprise
himself
listening
for
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
the
professor
and
find
that
without
any
definite
volition
his
eyes
were
watching
her
profile
and
one
day
when
she
passed
him
and
her
overall
brushed
his
sleeve
he
found
that
he
was
blushing
maskew
with
his
usual
easy
familiarity
was
already
on
joking
terms
with
her
and
would
sometimes
sit
on
the
table
where
she
kept
her
microscope
while
they
talked
and
laughed
together
but
though
edwin
had
every
chance
of
sharing
in
this
intimacy
he
bring
himself
to
do
so
and
when
in
the
end
he
was
introduced
to
her
formally
he
wished
that
he
were
dead
and
could
not
speak
a
word
for
awkwardness
with
men
on
the
other
hand
he
was
now
quite
at
his
ease
even
strangely
enough
with
the
once
formidable
griffin
since
the
day
when
he
had
discovered
his
old
enemy
in
the
common
room
they
had
often
spoken
to
one
another
they
had
even
sat
side
by
side
in
the
deep
basket
chairs
one
of
which
was
now
habitual
abode
and
talked
of
the
old
days
at
and
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
they
would
share
a
pot
of
tea
there
was
no
awkwardness
in
their
conversation
as
edwin
had
feared
there
might
be
for
griffin
apparently
took
his
expulsion
as
a
matter
of
course
and
on
the
whole
as
rather
a
good
joke
of
course
griffin
had
changed
it
was
clear
to
edwin
from
the
first
that
in
some
way
he
had
indeed
physically
for
he
was
fatter
than
ever
but
the
air
of
conscious
and
threatening
physical
superiority
that
edwin
had
found
so
oppressive
in
his
school
days
had
vanished
moreover
he
was
now
prepared
to
accept
edwin
as
an
equal
and
make
him
the
confidant
of
the
amorous
adventures
that
now
absorbed
his
time
adventures
to
which
the
affair
with
the
chambermaid
at
had
been
the
mildest
possible
prelude
compared
with
positive
achievements
the
daring
of
relation
with
the
young
ladies
of
the
dousita
seemed
a
trifle
thin
father
with
a
shrewd
appreciation
of
his
peculiar
gifts
had
entered
him
as
a
student
at
the
school
of
brewing
and
if
once
he
could
overcome
his
natural
indolence
there
was
no
reason
why
in
the
future
he
should
not
become
a
partner
in
the
firm
of
his
uncle
sir
joseph
astill
and
control
the
destinies
of
a
number
of
barmaids
beyond
the
dreams
of
concupiscence
on
these
prospects
griffin
lounging
in
his
basket
chair
brooded
with
a
heavy
satisfaction
a
funny
thing
it
edwin
said
one
day
we
should
be
the
only
men
in
this
some
are
bound
to
turn
up
sooner
or
later
said
griffin
other
day
when
i
was
up
in
town
i
ran
against
remember
he
told
me
that
his
people
thought
of
sending
him
here
to
take
up
would
be
rather
good
fun
said
edwin
cut
out
for
it
too
got
that
sort
of
head
i
should
rather
like
to
see
old
roll
up
one
of
these
days
are
you
doing
anything
in
particular
this
afternoon
i
have
to
stroll
down
to
see
the
at
the
gaiety
an
awful
good
sport
suppose
we
go
down
the
town
and
get
a
drink
on
the
way
in
spite
of
the
temptations
of
this
adventure
edwin
declined
in
the
dissecting
room
half
an
hour
later
brown
hailed
him
the
devil
were
you
doing
with
that
pig
of
a
brewer
ingleby
an
old
school
friend
of
i
should
keep
that
dark
if
i
were
you
a
bad
hat
that
chap
we
want
virginal
innocence
corrupted
do
we
maskew
not
a
bad
sort
edwin
protested
a
nasty
fellow
and
come
to
a
rotten
sticky
end
said
brown
what
do
you
think
of
this
small
sciatic
you
old
roué
for
a
tricky
bit
of
dissection
after
all
edwin
reflected
old
brown
knew
something
of
the
world
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
there
was
something
obscene
about
griffin
it
was
difficult
to
explain
for
maskew
by
his
own
account
was
almost
equally
worldly
and
yet
maskew
was
undeniably
a
decent
fellow
while
griffin
undeniably
he
joined
his
friends
at
their
work
and
could
think
about
nothing
else
for
brains
were
as
good
as
his
own
though
of
a
different
texture
and
he
had
to
be
attentive
to
keep
pace
with
them
all
through
the
vac
he
worked
at
anatomy
with
these
two
sometimes
in
the
icy
dissecting
room
sometimes
over
coffee
at
the
dousita
sometimes
in
the
cozy
diminutive
diggings
that
brown
inhabited
in
easy
row
a
street
of
georgian
houses
at
the
back
of
the
university
buildings
and
near
the
hospital
they
were
pleasant
days
edwin
in
spite
of
his
lightness
had
now
found
a
place
in
the
scrum
of
the
second
fifteen
and
on
saturday
evenings
when
both
of
them
were
drugged
with
their
weekly
debauch
of
exercise
he
and
would
meet
at
the
diggings
in
easy
row
and
after
a
steaming
hot
bath
in
the
process
of
which
edwin
never
failed
to
be
impressed
by
the
immensity
of
his
physique
they
would
set
off
down
the
town
together
and
make
a
tremendous
meal
at
the
coliseum
grill
porterhouse
steak
with
chipped
potatoes
and
huge
silver
tankards
of
bitter
ale
then
they
would
go
on
together
to
a
theatre
or
a
music
hall
too
pleasantly
dulled
too
mildly
elated
to
question
the
humour
of
the
most
comedian
after
the
show
would
walk
down
to
the
station
with
edwin
and
see
him
off
into
the
last
train
for
halesby
and
edwin
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
window
would
see
the
big
man
turn
and
go
clumsily
along
the
platform
with
the
gait
that
he
had
noticed
on
the
very
first
day
of
his
life
as
a
medical
student
brown
was
a
wonderful
fellow
in
half
an
hour
edwin
reflected
when
his
train
was
still
puffing
away
through
the
dark
would
be
back
in
his
diggings
with
a
clay
pipe
stuck
in
his
mouth
and
a
huge
of
anatomy
open
on
his
knees
driving
facts
into
that
puzzled
brain
with
the
violent
thoroughness
of
an
engine
that
drives
piles
when
the
last
train
arrived
at
halesby
the
town
would
be
in
darkness
for
in
the
black
country
in
those
days
the
only
places
of
amusement
were
the
public
houses
and
these
had
been
shut
for
an
hour
or
more
only
from
the
upper
windows
of
innumerable
mean
dwellings
lights
would
be
seen
and
sometimes
the
voice
of
a
drunken
husband
heard
grumbling
but
the
path
beside
the
was
beautiful
even
on
a
winter
night
and
edwin
would
feel
glad
as
he
plodded
along
it
that
he
live
in
north
bromwich
where
the
night
noises
of
the
country
were
never
heard
so
he
would
pass
quietly
up
the
empty
lane
his
footsteps
echoing
on
the
hard
pavement
and
come
at
last
to
the
little
house
set
in
the
midst
of
shrubberies
that
smelt
of
winter
very
humble
and
quiet
and
even
pitiable
it
seemed
after
the
glaring
streets
of
the
city
that
he
had
left
behind
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
on
saturdays
when
he
had
been
playing
football
edwin
should
return
by
the
last
train
and
so
his
father
did
not
sit
up
for
him
on
these
occasions
the
matter
had
been
settled
at
the
cost
of
some
awkwardness
on
the
first
two
or
three
saturdays
of
the
football
season
edwin
had
come
home
late
to
find
ingleby
growing
cold
over
the
embers
of
a
fire
in
the
sleepy
but
intensely
serious
and
his
tired
eyes
had
examined
edwin
so
closely
that
he
felt
embarrassed
being
certain
that
his
face
must
bear
signs
of
a
number
of
enormities
that
he
had
never
dreamed
of
committing
it
was
the
same
unreasonable
feeling
of
guilt
that
he
had
experienced
at
in
the
middle
of
pitched
battle
for
purity
and
the
sensation
was
so
strong
that
he
felt
it
useless
to
try
and
hide
it
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
father
he
said
the
quietude
and
humility
of
the
little
room
seem
to
him
as
full
of
accusation
as
his
face
do
you
mean
boy
think
you
know
what
i
really
no
need
for
you
to
wait
up
for
me
like
like
to
lock
the
house
up
his
father
replied
with
a
quietness
that
made
voice
sound
rowdy
and
violent
have
always
done
so
after
all
are
anxious
about
me
why
should
you
be
more
anxious
about
me
when
i
come
in
at
twelve
than
when
i
come
in
at
six
know
passing
a
critical
period
eddie
not
unsympathetic
been
through
it
myself
and
naturally
anxious
for
you
i
know
that
a
town
is
full
of
temptations
for
a
boy
of
your
age
i
know
what
your
friends
are
like
i
know
what
sort
of
influences
coming
in
contact
i
see
why
that
should
make
you
want
to
sit
up
for
me
really
i
what
good
does
it
do
like
to
see
you
when
you
come
edwin
was
uncomfortably
aware
of
this
suppose
i
was
drunk
when
i
came
in
he
said
suppose
anything
of
the
but
supposing
i
was
what
advantage
would
there
be
in
your
seeing
me
what
good
would
it
do
any
rate
i
should
know
that
there
was
a
if
all
the
trouble
we
can
soon
get
over
it
i
promise
you
that
tell
you
the
very
first
time
that
i
am
in
the
least
drunk
then
you
worry
about
waiting
for
it
i
suppose
bound
to
happen
some
sincerely
hope
it
eddie
it
pleasant
to
me
to
hear
you
talk
like
i
suppose
it
would
be
pleasanter
if
we
pretended
that
nothing
of
the
kind
ever
happened
but
it
be
honest
would
it
i
should
think
the
duty
of
every
one
to
be
drunk
some
time
or
other
if
only
to
see
what
it
feels
like
surely
father
really
we
be
personal
you
forget
that
your
i
father
i
thought
we
were
going
to
be
such
tremendous
pals
and
honestly
there
much
to
be
pals
on
if
you
ever
personal
we
ought
to
talk
about
everything
we
to
hide
anything
i
see
much
fun
in
it
if
i
have
to
do
all
the
telling
and
you
give
anything
in
return
it
my
dear
boy
said
ingleby
with
a
nervous
laugh
seem
to
neglect
the
fundamental
fact
that
your
see
why
that
should
prevent
us
being
honest
i
see
why
it
should
prevent
you
from
trusting
do
trust
you
all
right
so
you
wait
up
for
me
thus
the
matter
was
settled
at
any
rate
on
the
surface
though
edwin
was
always
conscious
on
the
morning
after
his
late
arrivals
of
an
anxious
scrutiny
on
his
part
really
trust
me
he
thought
and
this
conviction
made
him
more
anxious
than
ever
to
be
really
intimate
with
his
father
to
make
him
share
as
much
as
possible
the
life
that
he
was
living
in
north
bromwich
it
made
him
talk
deliberately
of
the
men
who
were
his
friends
and
the
work
that
he
was
doing
explaining
with
the
greatest
freedom
the
domestic
difficulties
of
and
the
worldly
accomplishments
of
maskew
and
this
frankness
gave
him
confidence
until
he
discovered
that
such
revelations
only
ended
by
arousing
his
suspicions
in
mind
it
was
evident
that
the
sterling
qualities
of
as
recited
by
edwin
were
of
less
importance
than
his
potentialities
as
an
agent
in
corruption
only
given
him
one
side
of
thought
edwin
have
been
quite
happy
if
going
to
be
happy
it
would
be
much
better
for
me
to
tell
him
nothing
that
his
imagination
can
work
he
found
himself
travelling
round
the
old
vicious
circle
that
appeared
to
be
the
inevitable
result
of
being
honest
with
himself
there
must
after
all
be
something
in
the
fundamental
fact
that
ingleby
was
his
father
ridiculous
though
it
might
seem
the
ideal
relation
between
father
and
son
was
evidently
impossible
he
said
with
a
sigh
my
fault
done
my
the
whole
artificiality
of
their
relation
only
dawned
on
him
when
he
mentioned
to
his
father
one
evening
that
he
had
met
griffin
and
told
him
that
his
old
enemy
turned
out
to
be
a
nephew
of
sir
joseph
astill
glad
to
hear
of
it
said
ingleby
hope
continue
to
be
friends
sir
joseph
astill
is
a
very
distinguished
edwin
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
but
he
resisted
the
temptation
of
telling
his
father
that
griffin
was
a
distinctly
bad
egg
and
that
in
comparison
with
him
with
his
herculean
passions
was
indeed
a
paragon
of
knightly
virtues
if
it
pleased
his
father
to
invest
griffin
with
his
reflected
glory
why
he
do
so
and
edwin
held
his
tongue
in
the
end
the
atmosphere
of
veiled
anxiety
that
awaited
him
at
home
became
definitely
irksome
and
since
the
most
absolute
candour
on
his
part
would
not
mend
matters
he
found
himself
gradually
avoiding
his
company
it
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
he
wanted
to
do
but
it
seemed
inevitable
and
as
the
months
passed
he
gave
up
all
hopes
of
the
sort
of
intimacy
that
he
had
desired
and
relapsed
into
the
solitude
of
his
own
room
or
even
as
a
last
resort
the
company
of
aunt
laura
who
was
at
least
unsuspicious
another
thing
attracted
him
to
her
house
all
the
days
of
his
childhood
at
home
had
been
full
of
music
for
his
mother
had
been
a
capable
pianist
and
he
had
spent
long
hours
stretched
out
on
the
hearthrug
in
the
listening
to
her
while
she
played
bach
and
beethoven
and
occasionally
mendelssohn
on
the
piano
at
too
without
any
definite
musical
education
he
had
felt
a
little
of
the
inspiration
that
downton
infused
into
the
chapel
services
since
he
had
returned
to
halesby
all
these
pleasures
had
left
him
for
ingleby
was
not
in
the
least
musical
and
the
piano
that
had
been
closed
a
few
days
before
his
death
had
never
been
reopened
at
this
period
he
had
not
realised
the
musical
possibilities
of
north
bromwich
and
in
aunt
house
he
recaptured
a
little
of
this
stifled
interest
she
was
really
an
accomplished
musician
and
though
the
kind
of
music
that
she
affected
was
becoming
limited
by
the
very
character
of
her
life
as
the
wife
of
an
undistinguished
manufacturer
of
small
hardware
in
a
small
town
the
taste
which
had
originally
been
formed
in
germany
existed
and
was
easily
encouraged
by
admiration
of
her
attainments
here
usually
on
sundays
when
in
addition
to
the
attraction
of
music
her
admirable
cooking
was
to
be
appreciated
edwin
passed
many
happy
hours
she
sang
well
and
could
accompany
herself
with
something
of
a
natural
genius
and
though
the
songs
that
she
sang
were
often
enough
the
sugary
ballads
of
the
period
that
had
witnessed
her
musical
extinction
edwin
found
them
satisfying
to
his
starved
sense
of
music
and
would
even
persuade
her
on
occasion
to
play
the
pieces
of
chopin
beethoven
and
bach
with
which
his
mother
had
made
him
familiar
nothing
aroused
in
him
an
acute
remembrance
of
those
ancient
happy
days
more
easily
than
music
he
wished
above
all
things
that
he
might
some
day
be
able
to
taste
these
joys
for
himself
and
so
he
persuaded
his
aunt
to
teach
him
the
notes
on
the
piano
and
having
an
inherited
aptitude
he
soon
found
that
he
could
pick
his
way
through
simple
compositions
preferably
in
the
open
key
that
he
found
among
his
music
at
home
ingleby
who
had
no
ear
appeared
to
be
unmoved
by
these
painful
experiments
and
to
edwin
the
long
winter
evenings
were
made
magical
by
their
indulgence
he
would
sit
at
the
piano
in
the
for
hours
at
a
time
and
here
in
a
strange
way
he
found
himself
curiously
in
touch
with
the
vanishing
memory
of
his
mother
at
times
this
feeling
was
so
acute
that
he
could
almost
have
imagined
that
she
was
there
in
the
room
beside
him
and
sometimes
he
would
sit
still
at
the
piano
in
long
intervals
of
silence
just
drinking
in
this
peculiar
and
soothing
atmosphere
eventually
these
diversions
made
ingleby
uneasy
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
at
the
piano
edwin
he
said
do
hope
you
are
not
letting
it
interfere
with
your
edwin
said
nothing
but
from
that
time
onward
it
seemed
to
him
that
even
this
the
most
harmless
of
his
amusements
had
become
a
matter
for
grudging
and
suspicion
at
first
he
only
felt
indignation
and
anger
but
later
he
realised
that
this
along
with
his
other
anxieties
probably
had
its
origin
in
financial
considerations
the
cost
of
his
education
in
north
bromwich
was
a
big
thing
for
a
country
chemist
to
face
if
once
he
failed
the
whole
of
his
early
effort
might
be
wasted
but
then
he
was
not
going
to
fail
ii
the
terminal
examinations
at
christmas
had
made
him
sure
of
this
they
showed
him
that
in
his
own
year
he
and
maskew
were
in
a
class
by
themselves
and
though
maskew
beat
him
easily
in
all
the
subjects
of
the
examination
it
satisfied
him
a
little
to
think
that
maskew
had
probably
put
in
a
good
deal
more
work
than
he
had
particularly
in
anatomy
where
he
had
the
advantage
of
working
in
partnership
with
for
whom
the
subject
of
medical
education
was
of
the
most
deadly
seriousness
early
in
the
lent
term
edwin
found
himself
introduced
to
a
new
stratum
of
north
bromwich
society
through
the
accident
of
his
acquaintance
with
griffin
the
new
university
had
inherited
from
the
old
college
of
science
and
the
still
older
medical
school
the
tradition
of
a
pantomime
night
a
visit
to
one
of
the
north
bromwich
theatres
where
this
elevating
flourished
for
three
months
out
of
the
twelve
the
evening
was
one
of
fancy
dress
rowdiness
and
general
licence
in
which
the
stage
suffered
as
much
as
the
auditorium
and
the
unfortunate
players
were
propitiated
for
the
ruin
of
their
performance
by
a
series
of
presentations
arrangements
for
this
function
were
always
made
with
a
high
seriousness
the
committee
was
composed
of
representatives
from
each
year
in
the
school
of
medicine
and
from
each
of
the
other
faculties
in
this
affair
as
in
all
matters
of
sport
or
communal
life
the
older
foundation
of
the
medical
school
took
the
most
prominent
part
but
the
prestige
of
griffin
as
the
nephew
of
the
and
an
acknowledged
expert
on
all
matters
theatrical
had
induced
the
brewers
to
run
him
for
the
secretaryship
and
since
the
secretary
was
the
official
on
whom
the
bulk
of
the
work
fell
and
no
one
was
particularly
anxious
to
take
on
the
job
griffin
in
his
first
year
had
been
elected
to
the
post
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
it
suited
him
to
begin
with
he
was
already
on
intimate
terms
with
every
theatre
manager
and
in
north
bromwich
and
was
used
to
dealing
with
the
susceptibilities
of
theatrical
people
again
he
had
plenty
of
money
a
circumstance
that
would
help
him
in
the
preliminaries
which
were
expensively
conducted
in
the
local
bodega
and
other
bars
and
restaurants
also
it
gave
griffin
something
to
do
for
the
life
of
the
student
in
brewing
was
of
the
leisurely
and
somnolent
character
that
one
would
naturally
associate
with
malt
liquors
and
most
of
his
time
had
previously
been
spent
sprawling
in
a
deep
basket
chair
in
the
common
room
playing
an
occasional
languid
game
of
poker
or
jingling
sovereigns
in
his
pocket
while
he
waited
for
the
results
of
racing
in
the
evening
papers
at
the
annual
meeting
which
edwin
had
not
been
sufficiently
interested
to
attend
there
had
been
the
usual
difficulty
in
selecting
a
member
from
the
unknown
quantities
of
the
first
year
and
griffin
full
of
resource
had
suggested
edwin
who
was
straightway
elected
and
summoned
to
attend
the
deliberations
that
followed
his
election
caused
a
good
deal
of
amusement
to
his
friends
and
particularly
martin
who
preserved
an
aristocratic
contempt
for
this
vulgar
theatrical
business
and
who
prophesied
conversion
into
a
blood
but
it
introduced
him
to
a
new
and
bewildering
society
in
which
he
met
a
number
of
men
of
his
own
faculty
who
had
already
become
impressive
at
a
distance
such
were
the
brothers
wade
the
elder
unapproachable
in
his
final
year
the
younger
of
an
elegance
surpassing
that
of
harrop
such
was
freddie
aubyn
a
slight
and
immaculate
figure
with
fair
hair
and
moustache
and
the
most
carefully
cultivated
reputation
for
elegant
dissipation
in
north
bromwich
this
byronic
person
had
already
suffered
the
pangs
of
a
long
intrigue
with
the
in
a
musical
comedy
company
on
whom
he
was
reputed
to
have
spent
money
and
passion
lavishly
but
without
the
least
suggestion
of
grossness
in
addition
to
this
he
was
a
poet
that
is
to
say
he
had
published
two
volumes
of
verse
that
were
so
eclectic
as
to
be
out
of
print
at
the
present
time
he
had
stuck
midway
in
his
medical
career
pending
the
issue
of
his
unhappy
passion
and
presented
the
unusual
spectacle
of
a
not
by
force
of
incompetence
but
by
choice
in
point
of
fact
he
was
an
unconscious
survival
from
the
nineties
and
the
lady
of
his
choice
resembled
a
creation
of
beardsley
more
than
any
type
commonly
known
to
nature
edwin
was
impressed
for
the
writer
of
the
exhausted
of
was
the
first
poet
that
he
had
met
in
the
flesh
naturally
attitude
towards
the
man
was
a
little
patronising
but
edwin
found
his
mixture
of
cynicism
and
melancholy
enchanting
and
was
particularly
impressed
when
freddie
languidly
supporting
his
sorrows
in
one
of
the
common
room
offered
him
a
fill
from
his
pipe
by
the
way
opium
in
it
he
said
casually
visions
of
coleridge
and
de
quincey
invaded
mind
he
stopped
filling
his
pipe
why
on
earth
do
you
put
opium
in
it
is
an
aid
to
the
imagination
said
freddie
it
deadens
pain
he
added
significantly
after
a
pause
that
alcohol
is
useless
tried
think
have
some
of
my
own
if
you
mind
said
edwin
quite
agree
with
you
it
would
be
much
wiser
said
aubyn
you
have
no
need
for
it
descensus
from
that
day
forward
edwin
was
always
eagerly
searching
the
face
and
the
pupils
of
freddie
for
any
symptoms
of
opium
poisoning
he
never
found
any
and
to
whom
he
confided
this
thrilling
incident
assured
him
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
freddie
had
probably
never
smoked
opium
in
his
life
and
that
the
whole
thing
was
nothing
more
than
one
of
the
poses
that
this
gentleman
adopted
for
shocking
the
youthful
and
bourgeois
the
impressive
freddie
according
to
was
a
damned
anæmic
waster
if
only
it
had
not
been
for
the
exhausted
of
edwin
might
have
agreed
with
him
the
solemn
meetings
of
the
committee
engaged
edwin
three
afternoons
a
week
as
a
congregation
of
amazing
bloods
they
were
enthralling
but
as
business
gatherings
they
were
more
remarkable
still
they
were
held
in
the
saloon
bar
of
a
modern
public
house
all
palatial
mahogany
red
plush
and
called
the
white
horse
and
the
principal
business
of
the
day
was
the
consumption
of
hot
whisky
with
sugar
and
slices
of
lemon
in
it
during
which
griffin
armed
with
a
conspicuous
reported
on
his
activities
which
appeared
mainly
to
be
social
thursday
he
would
say
took
mary
loraine
to
lunch
at
the
grand
midland
and
she
said
or
saw
tommy
fane
in
his
the
other
night
and
he
said
here
old
boy
apparently
all
theatrical
friends
called
him
the
effect
of
these
narrations
on
griffin
would
be
so
exhausting
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
order
more
whisky
all
round
the
manager
himself
would
bring
it
in
a
brilliant
gentleman
named
juniper
with
red
baggy
cheeks
the
laxness
of
which
was
compensated
by
a
waxed
moustache
that
stuck
out
on
either
side
as
if
a
skewer
had
transfixed
them
to
griffin
this
magnificent
creature
was
most
decorous
for
the
white
horse
was
one
of
houses
and
griffin
had
taken
the
trouble
to
inform
him
that
the
great
sir
joseph
was
his
uncle
in
spite
of
rather
than
as
a
result
of
these
meetings
the
arranged
itself
the
date
was
fixed
the
bouquets
and
presents
purchased
the
announcements
in
the
papers
that
warned
any
patrons
of
pantomime
that
on
this
particular
night
they
could
not
hope
to
see
a
normal
performance
inserted
griffin
in
the
common
room
became
a
centre
of
feverish
importance
and
even
edwin
in
spite
of
the
superciliousness
of
martin
and
the
rough
chaff
of
caught
a
little
of
the
reflected
glamour
edwin
now
had
to
face
the
ordeal
of
announcing
the
approach
of
to
his
father
if
he
were
to
see
the
thing
through
as
was
his
duty
as
a
member
of
the
committee
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
catch
the
last
train
to
halesby
which
left
north
bromwich
at
except
on
thursday
and
saturday
night
ingleby
hearing
saw
the
pit
gaping
beneath
feet
mention
this
to
me
i
suppose
you
have
had
to
spend
quite
a
lot
of
time
at
these
committee
meetings
i
think
it
was
rather
unwise
of
you
to
undertake
it
in
your
first
only
four
months
before
your
i
think
the
exam
will
be
all
right
said
edwin
airily
like
to
hear
you
speak
like
that
edwin
said
his
father
is
a
dangerous
it
be
any
better
pretending
that
i
think
it
was
all
right
surely
humility
is
a
great
any
greater
than
all
very
well
to
talk
about
honesty
but
it
would
have
been
more
honest
it
if
told
me
was
going
on
you
the
whole
point
if
i
told
you
everything
you
sleep
for
imagining
things
that
happened
the
thing
worried
me
ever
since
i
was
at
school
if
absolutely
honest
with
other
people
life
simply
worth
living
because
they
understand
it
it
done
come
to
the
conclusion
father
that
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
is
to
be
honest
with
you
can
trust
i
think
i
and
i
wish
believe
in
do
edwin
only
naturally
anxious
a
child
where
is
this
this
performance
held
the
theatre
this
i
suppose
that
is
better
than
a
music
his
prejudice
against
the
music
halls
or
as
they
were
then
beginning
to
be
called
theatres
of
varieties
was
an
old
story
edwin
could
hardly
resist
the
temptation
of
telling
him
that
the
performers
in
the
pantomime
were
nearly
all
artistes
but
ingleby
saved
him
by
asking
him
where
he
intended
to
sleep
i
expect
will
give
me
a
in
his
suppose
said
ingleby
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
brown
is
also
on
the
the
idea
of
the
honest
as
a
member
of
this
constellation
of
bloods
tickled
edwin
he
now
wished
to
goodness
never
told
his
father
of
family
differences
and
of
his
lucky
double
on
the
lincoln
and
national
no
old
far
too
sober
for
this
sort
of
it
was
an
unfortunate
word
repeated
ingleby
i
suppose
you
will
have
to
go
but
i
do
he
say
what
he
hoped
but
edwin
knew
and
was
content
to
leave
it
at
that
iii
the
great
day
came
and
edwin
found
as
some
compensation
for
the
scoffing
of
and
the
superciliousness
of
martin
and
maskew
that
his
position
was
really
one
of
some
importance
all
the
men
even
the
immaculate
harrop
had
decided
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
up
to
the
last
minute
edwin
was
busy
selling
tickets
he
had
asked
to
put
him
up
and
as
a
matter
of
form
had
consented
suppose
i
shall
see
you
after
midnight
my
son
he
said
with
his
usual
thoroughness
in
everything
that
he
attempted
had
determined
to
make
a
night
of
it
will
do
me
good
to
make
a
damned
fool
of
myself
for
once
in
a
way
he
said
only
for
the
sake
of
realising
it
afterwards
they
put
in
a
hard
work
together
first
and
then
he
and
edwin
and
maskew
went
together
to
rooms
to
change
they
were
all
rather
excited
and
carried
a
bottle
of
whisky
in
each
of
his
coat
pockets
the
first
of
which
was
broached
as
an
aperitif
while
they
were
changing
in
less
than
an
hour
they
emerged
attired
as
nearly
as
convention
would
allow
him
in
the
manner
of
his
woaded
ancestry
a
splendid
caveman
with
lowering
black
brows
and
hairy
arms
like
those
of
a
gorilla
a
disguise
that
only
called
for
a
little
accentuation
of
his
natural
characteristics
to
be
made
effective
maskew
again
in
character
as
a
restoration
cavalier
and
edwin
in
the
modest
guise
of
pierrot
in
the
foyer
of
the
theatre
they
met
martin
who
had
driven
down
in
a
hansom
from
alvaston
clothed
in
six
feet
of
baby
linen
with
a
feeding
bottle
round
his
neck
the
stalls
were
already
full
of
a
carnival
crowd
of
students
and
the
rest
of
the
house
was
crowded
with
spectators
who
had
come
to
enjoy
the
rag
and
other
unfortunate
people
who
had
entered
in
ignorance
of
the
festival
and
the
fact
that
their
form
of
entertainment
was
to
be
changed
for
one
night
only
there
among
the
crowd
edwin
found
griffin
a
fleshy
and
unsubtle
mephistopheles
the
mephistopheles
of
gounod
not
of
goethe
and
freddie
aubyn
romantically
pale
in
a
wig
of
black
curls
that
he
had
procured
for
his
presentation
of
byron
freddie
in
the
interests
of
verisimilitude
had
even
shaved
his
moustache
only
the
earlier
part
of
the
performance
remained
in
memory
the
rest
of
it
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
brilliant
haze
from
which
single
moments
of
wild
picturesqueness
detached
themselves
as
when
he
had
a
vision
of
a
prehistoric
man
armed
with
a
waving
whisky
bottle
for
a
club
and
feebly
restrained
by
a
flushed
cavalier
flown
with
insolence
and
wine
storming
his
way
through
the
surging
crowd
in
front
of
the
stalls
bar
and
planting
his
feet
upon
the
counter
or
of
the
same
barbarian
gently
armed
by
a
tactful
manager
in
evening
dress
putting
his
weapon
to
the
usages
of
peace
and
friendliness
by
uncorking
it
and
offering
its
contents
to
a
firm
but
policeman
a
splendid
fellow
is
edwin
thought
to
himself
splendid
and
while
he
was
thinking
this
a
sombre
poet
with
shining
eyes
drew
him
aside
and
confessed
to
him
almost
with
tears
that
all
this
brilliance
and
colour
and
life
meant
nothing
to
him
compared
with
the
memory
of
the
beardsley
lady
whose
ankles
were
so
thin
that
they
might
be
spanned
with
his
little
finger
light
as
a
feather
said
the
poet
swansdown
all
soul
of
course
old
fellow
i
know
that
you
can
understand
i
talk
like
this
to
any
other
person
in
the
and
edwin
understood
and
realised
the
justice
of
the
choice
of
a
confidant
so
sympathetically
that
he
was
spurred
to
confidences
on
his
own
part
see
i
happen
to
be
a
poet
myself
he
said
and
to
prove
it
he
felt
bound
to
recite
a
sonnet
that
he
had
composed
a
year
or
two
before
at
a
magnificent
sonnet
it
seemed
to
him
perhaps
more
magnificent
for
the
accompaniment
of
a
song
in
waltz
rhythm
by
the
theatre
orchestra
it
was
flattering
to
find
that
byron
agreed
with
him
as
to
its
excellence
but
while
the
poet
was
pressing
his
hand
in
congratulatory
brotherhood
and
edwin
was
just
deciding
to
recite
it
all
over
again
the
sinister
figure
of
mephistopheles
appeared
and
parted
them
telling
him
that
miss
marie
loraine
was
now
singing
the
last
verse
of
her
song
and
that
in
two
minutes
it
would
be
his
duty
to
present
her
with
a
bouquet
and
a
pair
of
silver
still
reciting
the
most
telling
lines
of
his
sonnet
he
was
conducted
by
mephistopheles
through
the
office
where
a
young
lady
who
in
her
inviting
softness
resembled
miss
wheeler
was
counting
the
of
tickets
and
through
a
subterranean
passage
with
the
welcome
chill
of
a
catacomb
to
the
wings
of
the
theatre
where
a
florid
bouquet
was
thrust
into
his
hands
it
struck
edwin
that
the
scent
of
the
flowers
was
of
a
suffocating
heaviness
until
he
realised
that
the
overpowering
perfume
of
which
he
was
aware
proceeded
not
from
the
bouquet
but
from
the
scents
and
powders
of
a
bevy
of
creatures
of
unnatural
loveliness
who
stood
waiting
in
the
wings
they
were
the
ladies
of
the
chorus
and
the
nature
of
their
costume
would
have
given
them
an
excuse
for
shivering
but
they
did
not
appear
to
be
conscious
of
the
heat
that
throbbed
in
brain
the
scent
and
the
proximity
of
such
a
huge
expanse
of
naked
flesh
excited
him
at
this
moment
all
his
awkwardness
seemed
to
have
vanished
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
the
same
person
who
had
blushed
at
the
mere
contact
of
the
american
overall
or
sat
speechless
in
the
presence
of
miss
wheeler
at
the
dousita
his
old
modesty
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
a
ridiculous
and
inexcusable
folly
for
at
the
moment
he
would
have
welcomed
the
prospect
of
making
the
most
shameless
advances
to
any
one
of
these
houris
in
competition
with
any
man
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
air
of
a
sultan
he
surveyed
them
deciding
to
which
of
those
blossoms
the
handkerchief
should
be
thrown
get
along
with
you
said
the
pushing
him
forward
he
gripped
the
presents
in
his
hands
and
treading
on
air
advanced
on
to
the
stage
where
miss
marie
loraine
was
kissing
her
hands
to
the
stalls
the
stage
was
very
big
and
sloped
in
such
a
way
that
he
felt
his
feet
impelled
towards
the
footlights
but
being
determined
that
he
would
accomplish
his
mission
with
dignity
edwin
steered
a
steady
if
resilient
course
in
front
of
him
he
saw
a
creature
before
whose
elegance
and
beauty
the
beauty
of
the
chorus
was
as
nothing
she
stood
waiting
for
him
and
smiled
for
a
moment
edwin
faced
the
auditorium
a
vast
and
dark
abyss
in
which
not
a
single
face
was
to
be
seen
it
gave
him
a
sudden
fright
to
think
that
so
many
thousands
of
unseen
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
patch
of
limelight
in
which
he
stood
he
pulled
himself
together
this
was
the
moment
he
thought
in
which
it
was
for
him
to
make
some
speech
worthy
of
the
bewildering
loveliness
that
stood
before
him
on
said
the
impatient
voice
of
mephistopheles
in
the
wings
loraine
said
edwin
with
a
flourish
have
the
honour
the
middle
of
his
sentence
was
broken
by
a
crash
and
a
tremendous
peal
of
laughter
from
the
unseen
thousands
the
younger
wade
arrayed
in
the
panoply
of
a
roman
legionary
and
balanced
upon
the
parapet
of
the
stage
box
had
fallen
with
a
clash
of
armour
into
the
big
drum
edwin
thrust
the
bouquet
and
the
into
the
arms
of
miss
loraine
herself
convulsed
with
laughter
with
a
terrific
draught
the
curtain
swept
down
said
the
voice
of
mephistopheles
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
more
confused
than
ever
he
remembered
a
vision
of
this
surpassing
beauty
standing
in
the
wings
in
a
long
silk
wrapper
that
her
dresser
had
thrown
over
her
shoulders
and
thanking
him
for
his
presentation
to
edwin
the
moment
seemed
the
beginning
of
a
passionate
romance
he
remembered
other
moments
in
the
auditorium
in
which
and
maskew
figured
he
remembered
the
taste
of
a
glass
of
benedictine
a
liqueur
that
he
had
never
tasted
before
that
maskew
gave
him
to
pull
him
together
again
after
his
exertions
on
the
stage
he
remembered
a
flashing
of
lights
an
uproar
a
and
the
singing
of
save
the
and
then
he
found
himself
a
member
of
a
small
but
distinguished
brotherhood
streaming
at
a
tremendous
rate
up
the
wide
street
that
led
towards
the
hospital
all
of
them
were
medicals
and
most
of
them
his
seniors
freddie
aubyn
the
wade
brothers
and
maskew
were
among
them
out
of
the
main
road
they
passed
singing
into
the
meaner
streets
that
surrounded
the
hospital
miserable
streets
with
low
houses
and
courts
clustered
on
either
side
from
the
upper
windows
of
which
astonished
working
men
and
women
in
their
nightdresses
put
out
their
heads
to
look
at
the
vocal
procession
opposite
the
portico
of
the
hospital
was
a
cab
rank
on
which
a
solitary
hansom
was
standing
with
the
horse
asleep
in
the
shafts
and
the
driver
taking
his
rest
inside
the
sight
appeared
to
arouse
the
fighting
instincts
of
the
elder
wade
god
he
said
with
indignation
a
cab
what
the
hell
does
the
fellow
think
doing
here
at
this
time
of
night
he
must
be
drunk
look
at
it
his
brother
who
could
carry
his
liquor
better
tried
to
persuade
him
to
leave
the
cab
alone
but
before
any
one
knew
what
was
happening
he
had
thrown
himself
on
it
and
turned
the
whole
affair
upside
down
in
the
road
edwin
heard
a
crash
of
splintered
glass
he
saw
the
cab
on
its
side
and
the
sleepy
horse
with
its
legs
in
the
air
he
thought
god
what
has
happened
and
the
next
thing
he
saw
was
a
cabman
buttoned
up
to
his
ears
crawling
out
of
the
wreckage
and
cursing
fluently
at
wade
who
stared
for
a
moment
dazed
at
the
havoc
his
strength
had
created
and
then
bolted
for
the
shelter
of
the
hospital
the
cabman
now
thoroughly
awakened
bolted
after
him
edwin
glowed
with
admiration
for
achievement
it
was
the
deed
of
a
titan
a
splendid
berserker
the
cabby
had
burst
through
the
concourse
on
the
hospital
steps
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
wade
who
by
this
time
was
lying
quietly
on
a
hooded
stretcher
swatched
in
bandages
and
quite
unrecognisable
a
house
surgeon
in
a
white
overall
confronted
the
cabman
the
hospital
porters
in
uniform
stood
solemnly
at
his
elbow
the
house
surgeon
was
assuring
the
cabby
that
he
was
drunk
the
cabby
telling
the
lot
of
them
exactly
what
he
thought
of
them
hold
of
this
fellow
said
the
house
surgeon
to
the
porters
hold
him
while
i
get
a
stomach
the
porters
specially
qualified
for
dealing
with
midnight
drunks
obeyed
there
was
a
splendid
struggle
in
which
the
foaming
cabby
was
pitched
out
into
the
road
their
eyes
to
hell
the
bandaged
wade
was
carried
solemnly
upstairs
on
his
stretcher
and
brought
round
with
whisky
in
the
house
room
a
chamber
full
of
olympian
pickled
with
and
the
fumes
of
alcohol
some
one
it
was
the
cavalier
began
to
play
the
piano
edwin
seized
the
opportunity
to
recite
his
sonnet
until
laid
a
monstrous
hand
on
his
mouth
that
vision
ended
and
to
it
succeeded
one
of
cool
deserted
streets
with
far
too
many
for
liking
and
then
the
dishevelled
in
digs
in
which
they
had
dressed
with
a
pale
hissing
and
flaring
and
a
momentary
impression
of
asking
him
where
put
the
damned
corkscrew
edwin
remembered
rising
to
a
brilliant
extreme
of
wit
i
your
keeper
he
said
and
while
he
was
explaining
at
length
the
aptness
of
his
mot
knocked
the
neck
off
the
bottle
with
his
poker
eclipsing
any
possible
verbal
brilliance
in
the
middle
of
the
night
edwin
woke
and
staggered
in
the
dark
to
the
where
he
drank
a
draught
of
water
so
cool
and
sweet
as
to
be
astonishing
until
he
remembered
that
it
had
possibly
come
from
the
mountains
beyond
felindre
was
snoring
heavily
on
the
bed
that
he
had
just
left
snoring
got
on
his
nerves
so
that
he
had
to
prod
him
in
the
ribs
and
wake
him
a
proceeding
that
seemed
unjustly
to
resent
say
he
said
you
think
i
was
drunk
said
god
you
wake
me
to
ask
me
that
know
all
right
in
the
edwin
only
knew
that
his
head
was
splitting
and
that
he
was
hellishly
cold
chapter
iv
science
i
prophecy
that
edwin
would
know
all
about
it
in
the
morning
proved
correct
but
it
was
some
consolation
to
him
to
know
that
he
shared
the
experience
with
his
friends
all
the
next
day
he
went
about
his
work
with
maskew
feeling
a
little
and
a
peculiar
weakness
in
the
legs
made
him
disinclined
for
any
exertion
that
could
be
avoided
maskew
recovered
himself
more
easily
but
who
never
did
anything
by
halves
solemnly
embarked
on
a
that
lasted
for
a
whole
week
this
defection
disgusted
maskew
who
in
his
hard
capable
way
believed
in
moderation
in
all
in
vice
he
considered
conduct
bit
principally
because
he
was
deprived
of
his
company
in
the
dissecting
room
but
to
edwin
the
big
debauch
seemed
in
some
ways
heroic
and
in
keeping
with
his
titanic
physical
nature
a
spectacle
rather
for
awe
than
for
reproof
it
was
even
impressive
to
see
returning
like
a
giant
refreshed
with
vice
throwing
his
huge
energies
into
the
pursuits
that
he
had
abandoned
as
readily
as
he
had
lately
squandered
them
in
an
atmosphere
of
patchouli
in
this
line
edwin
would
have
found
it
constitutionally
impossible
to
compete
with
but
for
all
that
he
could
not
deny
that
he
felt
better
more
confident
and
more
complete
for
the
pantomime
experience
it
even
flattered
him
to
find
himself
regarded
as
something
of
a
blood
by
the
humbler
members
of
his
year
who
had
witnessed
his
adventure
on
the
theatre
stage
though
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
the
fact
that
martin
more
absorbed
than
ever
in
blameless
but
exacting
relations
with
the
eligible
young
ladies
of
alvaston
was
a
little
supercilious
as
to
his
attainments
with
the
approach
of
the
summer
and
the
first
examination
he
found
little
time
for
anything
but
work
the
preparation
for
the
exam
was
so
much
of
a
scramble
that
he
had
no
time
to
realise
the
imaginative
significance
of
the
subjects
in
which
he
was
engaged
he
did
not
guess
that
the
little
fat
professor
of
physics
who
lectured
so
drily
on
the
elements
of
his
science
was
actually
employing
his
leisure
in
the
tremendous
adventure
of
weighing
the
terrestrial
globe
or
that
certain
slender
aerials
stretched
like
the
web
of
a
spider
from
a
mast
at
the
top
of
the
university
buildings
were
actually
receiving
the
first
lispings
of
wireless
telegraphy
an
achievement
to
which
that
bearded
dreamer
the
principal
had
devoted
twenty
years
of
his
life
to
edwin
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
romantic
in
chemistry
or
physics
his
mind
could
not
conceive
that
science
was
a
minute
and
infinitely
laborious
conquest
of
the
properties
of
matter
atoms
and
molecules
and
the
electrons
still
trembling
in
the
realms
of
imponderable
speculation
were
no
more
to
him
than
abstractions
unrelated
to
the
needs
of
practical
human
life
they
were
only
facts
to
be
learned
by
rote
symbols
to
be
memorised
and
grouped
together
on
paper
like
the
letters
in
an
algebraic
calculation
and
the
whole
of
this
potentially
romantic
experience
was
clouded
by
his
own
headachy
distaste
for
the
gaseous
smells
of
the
laboratory
the
choking
yellow
fumes
of
chlorine
that
escaped
from
the
glass
cupboards
in
which
it
was
manufactured
and
the
less
tolerable
if
more
human
odour
of
sulphuretted
hydrogen
in
an
air
that
was
desiccated
by
the
blue
flames
of
half
a
hundred
bunsen
burners
these
two
subjects
were
nothing
more
than
an
arid
desert
of
facts
relating
to
dead
matter
through
which
he
had
to
fight
his
way
and
he
hated
them
in
comparison
with
them
biology
was
something
of
an
oasis
here
at
any
rate
he
had
to
deal
with
life
a
mystery
more
obvious
and
less
academic
the
contemplation
of
its
lower
forms
such
as
the
amoeba
a
tiny
speck
of
dreamy
protoplasm
stretching
out
its
languid
tentacles
living
its
remote
and
curiously
detached
life
with
no
aims
beyond
that
of
bare
mysterious
existence
filled
him
with
a
strange
awe
the
laboratory
in
which
these
researches
were
conducted
was
high
and
airy
and
not
associated
with
any
unpleasant
smells
except
at
the
season
when
the
class
were
engaged
upon
the
dissection
of
the
hideous
it
had
even
its
aspects
of
beauty
in
the
person
of
the
fair
american
in
her
dark
overall
and
for
this
reason
if
for
no
other
edwin
found
himself
becoming
most
proficient
in
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
the
examination
came
maskew
was
an
easy
first
and
carried
off
the
scholarship
for
the
year
edwin
came
second
with
a
which
even
if
it
satisfy
himself
was
enough
to
make
his
father
enthusiastic
martin
ambled
through
with
an
ease
that
challenged
respect
and
horribly
intense
and
determined
through
all
the
week
of
the
scraped
through
by
virtue
of
sheer
bulldog
tenacity
the
result
of
the
examination
did
edwin
good
if
only
by
convincing
him
that
maskew
for
all
his
suburban
flashiness
and
his
inferior
general
education
had
a
better
head
than
his
own
like
the
excellent
man
of
business
that
he
was
maskew
did
not
rest
upon
his
oars
the
week
after
the
examination
and
the
first
of
the
long
vacation
found
him
and
back
in
the
dissecting
room
plugging
into
anatomy
the
next
principal
subject
and
edwin
saw
at
once
that
if
he
were
to
keep
pace
with
his
rival
he
would
have
to
forgo
the
months
of
summery
leisure
to
which
he
had
looked
forward
in
the
vacation
martin
was
playing
tennis
in
ireland
and
so
he
found
himself
thrown
once
more
into
the
society
of
these
two
it
was
a
pleasant
time
for
their
leisure
was
their
own
and
there
were
no
lectures
to
tie
them
to
their
work
they
did
a
great
deal
of
their
reading
in
rooms
full
of
and
wreathed
in
tobacco
smoke
that
escaped
through
a
french
window
into
a
tiny
garden
plot
green
and
pleasant
under
the
white
midland
sky
and
this
room
became
a
haven
of
escape
from
the
burning
brick
pavements
in
which
edwin
and
his
friends
would
work
together
without
strain
talking
of
the
future
and
of
romantic
past
and
stabilising
their
own
ideas
on
the
uncertainties
of
sex
a
problem
that
so
far
had
meant
very
little
to
edwin
but
which
was
not
in
a
position
to
ignore
know
damned
funny
he
said
when
you
get
to
know
more
about
things
when
done
some
anatomy
and
that
you
begin
to
think
of
sex
in
a
different
light
it
knocks
all
the
mystery
out
of
it
and
sure
a
jolly
sound
thing
good
lord
when
i
think
of
the
ignorance
with
which
i
started
on
this
sort
of
thing
finding
out
everything
by
experiment
you
why
if
had
a
short
course
of
anatomy
before
i
left
school
i
should
have
been
saved
a
lot
of
rotten
experiments
that
do
me
or
any
one
else
any
good
have
been
a
damned
sight
than
i
ever
was
a
medical
a
jolly
good
thing
in
that
way
shows
you
exactly
where
you
are
instead
of
letting
you
go
fumbling
about
in
the
all
the
poetry
out
of
it
though
said
maskew
be
damned
said
seriously
a
good
deal
too
much
of
your
poetry
about
it
poetry
and
mystery
and
a
lot
of
bunkum
like
that
male
and
female
created
he
them
i
particularly
admire
the
method
i
think
he
made
rather
a
better
job
of
the
amoeba
think
how
much
simpler
it
would
be
to
split
open
a
chunk
of
protoplasm
instead
of
having
to
make
a
ridiculous
fool
of
yourself
if
you
want
to
propagate
your
species
still
there
it
is
and
the
sooner
you
realise
exactly
what
it
means
and
what
all
about
the
less
you
worry
your
head
about
of
course
if
going
to
treat
it
in
that
light
going
to
knock
all
the
pleasure
out
of
maskew
protested
a
sensualist
said
main
thing
that
i
have
against
it
is
that
it
wastes
valuable
he
became
scornful
of
all
these
rotten
fellows
who
spend
their
days
writing
books
on
sexual
problems
analysing
their
rotten
little
sensations
in
detail
and
gloating
over
mysteries
of
sex
only
their
ignorance
that
makes
them
like
that
what
they
want
is
a
thorough
course
of
anatomy
and
a
whack
of
practical
experience
to
cure
them
and
if
every
one
else
had
the
same
sort
of
education
be
no
sale
for
their
edwin
listening
to
their
sparring
remembered
the
library
at
and
a
certain
shelf
of
anatomical
works
that
was
always
kept
locked
with
a
special
key
that
leeming
carried
mysteriously
on
his
on
the
whole
he
agreed
with
and
his
preferences
for
the
methods
of
the
parthenogenesis
he
wondered
however
if
the
kind
of
education
that
advocated
would
have
scotched
the
production
of
such
works
as
and
or
the
love
poems
of
shelley
would
be
rather
rotten
if
you
did
away
with
love
he
said
not
talking
about
love
said
talking
about
a
ordinary
physical
needs
being
in
love
is
not
the
same
thing
as
is
usually
said
the
cynical
maskew
all
a
ridiculous
said
edwin
god
it
worry
ii
with
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
these
delicious
hours
of
leisure
disappeared
edwin
and
his
friends
with
the
assurance
of
men
became
the
real
possessors
of
the
dissecting
room
anatomy
and
physiology
now
absorbed
all
their
time
and
the
leisurely
interest
in
the
first
subject
which
had
been
subsidiary
in
the
first
year
was
now
a
matter
of
academical
life
and
death
from
the
simple
anatomical
details
of
the
upper
and
lower
extremities
that
he
had
dissected
with
martin
in
the
year
before
he
passed
to
the
more
vital
regions
of
the
human
body
the
thorax
the
abdomen
and
the
head
and
neck
he
still
attended
the
polished
course
of
lectures
on
anatomy
that
the
dean
delivered
in
the
theatre
but
this
process
he
was
forced
to
regard
as
a
waste
of
time
since
the
presentation
of
the
subject
did
not
differ
greatly
from
that
of
any
of
anatomy
and
the
personality
which
curiously
resembled
that
of
his
cousin
martin
was
too
aristocratically
remote
ever
to
seem
real
in
the
dissecting
room
on
the
other
hand
he
became
acquainted
and
fascinated
with
the
first
of
his
medical
instructors
who
had
aroused
his
imagination
this
was
the
chief
demonstrator
of
anatomy
robert
moon
or
more
familiarly
bobby
a
figure
of
romantic
picturesqueness
he
was
tall
and
inclined
to
be
fat
he
always
wore
a
black
and
his
serious
face
which
was
of
a
size
and
pallor
that
his
surname
suggested
was
crowned
by
an
erect
crop
of
black
and
curly
hair
in
first
year
he
had
always
seemed
to
him
a
strange
and
distant
figure
walking
slowly
up
and
down
the
dissecting
room
on
the
occasions
when
he
emerged
from
the
dark
chamber
which
he
inhabited
in
the
corner
near
the
door
like
a
fat
and
rather
sinister
spider
he
rarely
spoke
when
he
did
so
it
was
with
a
broad
north
country
accent
and
the
most
extraordinary
deliberation
and
formality
in
his
choice
of
words
with
the
men
in
the
second
year
he
possessed
an
enormous
reputation
not
only
for
his
exhaustive
knowledge
of
anatomy
by
the
side
of
which
the
attainments
seemed
merely
those
of
a
dilettante
but
also
for
his
excellence
as
a
coach
edwin
and
his
two
friends
became
sedulous
attendants
at
his
tutorials
where
standing
in
immobile
dignity
behind
one
of
the
zinc
tables
in
front
of
an
appropriate
background
of
blackboard
and
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
students
who
came
to
sit
at
his
feet
voluntarily
like
the
disciples
of
a
greek
philosopher
he
would
demonstrate
the
details
of
some
ragged
anatomical
part
that
had
lain
in
spirit
until
it
was
of
the
colour
and
consistency
of
leather
in
demonstrations
there
was
neither
imagination
nor
romance
they
were
merely
fascinating
in
virtue
of
the
amazing
exactitude
of
the
detail
which
his
brain
had
acquired
through
long
familiarity
with
the
dismembered
fragments
of
humanity
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
minute
observation
that
could
escape
him
and
his
questions
were
so
searching
and
unexpected
that
even
maskew
who
had
himself
a
prodigious
memory
for
minute
detail
and
could
carry
the
letter
of
a
textbook
in
his
head
was
constantly
floored
by
them
it
was
a
magnificent
stimulus
to
edwin
for
it
became
a
kind
of
game
to
master
a
part
so
thoroughly
that
bobby
could
not
stump
him
by
this
time
he
was
so
used
to
railway
travelling
that
between
the
morning
discussion
of
the
progress
of
the
war
that
had
just
broken
out
in
south
africa
and
the
appearance
of
halfpenny
papers
that
multiplied
like
greenfly
in
this
heated
atmosphere
he
could
read
his
of
anatomy
in
a
crowded
carriage
without
disturbance
apart
from
the
natural
curiosity
that
a
vision
of
luridly
coloured
diagrams
awakened
in
the
minds
of
his
fellow
passengers
and
particularly
the
bank
clerk
who
thirsted
in
a
way
that
would
have
approved
for
technical
instruction
in
the
matter
of
certain
organs
edwin
prepared
himself
for
the
tutorials
as
rigorously
as
if
he
had
been
approaching
a
vital
examination
he
spent
long
hours
in
his
bedroom
utterly
heedless
of
his
wide
prospect
of
wintry
fields
thinking
of
nothing
but
his
collection
of
bleached
bones
now
carefully
marked
with
coloured
chalks
to
show
the
origins
and
insertions
of
muscles
and
particularly
those
intricate
fretted
plates
that
are
joined
to
form
the
fragile
casket
of
the
human
skull
so
engrossed
was
he
in
absorbing
the
mere
details
of
their
physical
form
that
his
mind
had
no
room
for
other
speculations
of
the
kind
that
had
impressed
him
in
the
days
of
his
first
acquaintance
with
anatomy
it
never
struck
him
that
the
articulated
skull
which
grinned
at
him
from
his
mantelpiece
when
he
woke
each
morning
had
once
contained
the
convolutions
of
a
human
brain
a
mass
of
pulpy
matter
that
had
been
the
origin
of
strange
complications
of
movement
and
feeling
and
thought
the
storehouse
of
memories
the
spring
of
passions
and
the
theatre
of
dreams
he
did
not
even
know
if
the
skull
were
that
of
a
man
or
a
woman
to
him
it
was
no
more
than
an
assembly
of
dry
bones
intricate
in
their
relations
with
one
another
pierced
by
the
foramina
of
bewildering
nerves
and
all
of
which
must
be
visualised
and
stored
and
remembered
within
the
limits
of
another
structure
of
the
same
sutures
and
eminences
of
which
he
could
feel
with
his
own
fingers
when
he
rubbed
his
puzzled
head
he
used
to
go
back
to
tutorials
convinced
that
he
knew
all
that
was
to
be
known
of
the
subject
in
hand
and
then
bobby
in
his
slow
lancashire
voice
with
broadened
and
would
put
to
him
some
leisurely
question
that
showed
him
that
he
knew
nothing
very
decorously
and
slowly
these
questions
would
be
asked
and
since
the
answers
were
concerned
with
the
dryest
and
most
exact
of
physical
facts
guessing
was
of
no
help
to
him
and
silence
the
only
refuge
of
the
ignorant
no
display
either
of
knowledge
or
ignorance
had
the
least
effect
on
bobby
moon
his
wide
and
dreamy
face
showed
no
emotion
on
the
discovery
of
either
on
very
rare
occasions
he
would
descend
to
a
kind
of
ponderous
verbal
humour
slow
and
elephantine
like
the
humour
of
beethoven
but
even
in
these
moments
his
face
showed
no
signs
of
emotion
and
he
would
pass
on
without
waiting
for
any
recognition
of
his
joke
to
the
next
lethargic
question
harrop
he
would
say
slowly
is
the
fotty
pod
of
hovers
and
harrop
sitting
on
a
high
stool
that
showed
his
variegated
socks
to
perfection
would
reply
that
the
fatty
pad
of
havers
was
a
small
cushion
of
fat
set
in
the
head
of
the
femur
to
lubricate
the
hollow
of
the
acetabulum
the
picturesque
figure
of
moon
soon
began
to
dominate
impressions
of
the
dissecting
room
there
was
something
provocative
in
the
remoteness
of
this
black
and
solitary
form
from
all
the
concerns
of
human
life
edwin
conceived
him
to
be
a
kind
of
cerebral
abstraction
no
man
but
an
advanced
of
anatomy
curiously
endowed
with
the
powers
of
locomotion
and
speech
but
bereft
of
any
human
characteristic
it
amazed
him
to
discover
in
the
end
that
bobby
moon
was
nothing
of
the
sort
but
a
creature
of
the
most
delicate
human
tenderness
so
sensitive
to
the
appeals
of
beauty
and
humanity
that
he
had
been
forced
to
adopt
the
impassive
mask
that
was
all
that
his
pupils
knew
of
him
from
an
instinct
of
it
happened
in
this
way
during
the
early
part
of
his
second
year
edwin
had
become
conscious
of
a
new
figure
in
the
dissecting
room
that
of
a
man
named
boyce
a
student
with
a
brilliant
reputation
who
had
managed
in
some
inexplicable
way
to
fail
in
his
first
examination
and
be
left
behind
by
the
other
men
of
his
year
he
was
a
tall
fair
creature
with
a
long
face
and
small
very
blue
eyes
the
society
of
alvaston
had
made
him
friendly
with
martin
from
whom
new
relations
were
gradually
separating
him
the
only
characteristic
that
edwin
had
so
far
noticed
in
boyce
was
an
almost
literary
fluency
in
the
use
of
foul
language
which
left
even
harrop
gasping
boyce
was
working
alone
on
a
thorax
a
few
tables
away
from
edwin
he
was
a
neat
and
laborious
dissector
and
edwin
had
been
tempted
to
admire
the
skill
with
which
he
had
defined
the
network
of
the
system
of
coronary
arteries
and
veins
with
which
the
human
heart
is
enmeshed
boyce
was
evidently
far
less
unapproachable
than
edwin
had
imagined
and
while
they
were
examining
his
dissection
together
they
had
not
noticed
the
approach
of
dr
moon
who
had
walked
slowly
to
their
table
and
stood
gazing
at
the
specimen
through
his
moonlike
they
did
not
realise
that
he
was
near
them
until
they
heard
his
voice
slowly
intoning
a
line
of
poetry
heart
he
said
in
purple
like
a
house
of
kings
are
you
acquainted
with
that
line
boyce
sir
who
wrote
it
man
named
francis
thompson
he
was
a
medical
student
at
manchester
several
years
senior
to
i
know
his
name
said
boyce
is
a
friend
of
my
great
poet
said
bobby
solemnly
great
poet
the
contemplation
of
mortality
in
this
place
should
be
full
of
poetical
reflections
you
see
this
is
the
heart
of
a
very
old
or
a
very
dissolute
man
the
coronary
arteries
are
stiff
with
was
thinking
sir
said
edwin
encouraged
the
heart
of
shelley
that
trelawny
was
supposed
to
have
picked
out
of
the
funeral
pyre
when
the
body
was
burned
his
account
says
that
only
the
heart
was
left
he
gave
it
to
hunt
he
but
think
the
heart
would
be
burned
more
an
unlikely
story
looked
up
dreamily
at
the
a
strange
and
he
moved
away
his
big
head
still
in
the
air
and
his
hands
behind
his
back
say
said
edwin
no
idea
bobby
was
like
that
you
associate
him
with
poetry
would
you
he
seems
such
an
awfully
chap
dry
bones
you
boyce
laughed
you
know
bobby
nobody
does
here
except
my
father
an
incurable
sentimentalist
he
lives
an
awfully
lonely
sort
of
life
in
some
digs
up
in
alvaston
his
crammed
with
poetry
and
old
music
and
a
lot
of
ethnological
lumber
do
you
know
about
the
biggest
authority
in
england
on
prehistoric
man
the
least
idea
i
imagined
he
dreamed
of
nothing
but
bones
and
soft
but
a
wonderful
chap
really
are
you
keen
on
poetry
course
i
no
about
it
i
imagine
that
your
friends
brown
and
maskew
are
particularly
interested
in
it
my
by
way
of
being
a
poet
you
know
awfully
keen
on
his
work
do
you
know
it
edwin
was
ashamed
to
say
he
did
not
not
in
the
least
surprised
said
boyce
not
appreciated
you
know
except
by
other
poets
like
this
fellow
thompson
i
think
rather
good
as
a
matter
of
fact
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
my
father
if
come
up
to
our
place
some
day
i
can
show
you
a
lot
of
interesting
things
in
his
library
first
editions
and
things
like
that
no
idea
that
you
were
keen
on
the
tone
implied
such
an
appreciation
of
hectic
past
as
typified
by
his
solitary
appearance
on
the
stage
of
the
theatre
that
he
hastened
to
deny
the
impeachment
he
was
tremendously
pleased
to
have
struck
a
man
like
boyce
who
went
on
to
talk
about
music
of
which
edwin
knew
nothing
and
exuded
an
easy
atmosphere
of
culture
of
a
kind
that
he
envied
without
ever
losing
sight
of
the
fact
that
edwin
had
come
to
him
in
rather
a
questionable
shape
edwin
was
thrilled
to
think
that
he
had
reached
the
threshold
of
a
new
and
exciting
friendship
which
made
his
association
with
brown
and
maskew
seem
commonplace
and
shabby
but
he
was
far
too
shy
to
force
himself
on
boyce
and
so
the
acquaintance
remained
for
many
months
at
the
exact
stage
in
which
it
had
begun
and
he
had
to
be
content
with
the
sudden
insight
that
boyce
had
given
him
into
the
hidden
romantic
qualities
of
dr
moon
sometimes
while
he
was
scrubbing
his
hands
with
carbolic
soap
the
only
thing
that
really
banished
the
smell
of
the
dissecting
room
from
his
fingers
he
would
hear
boyce
discussing
music
and
particularly
the
work
of
tschaikowsky
whose
sixth
symphony
had
just
inflamed
his
imagination
with
mr
moon
in
his
gloomy
bunk
and
he
would
go
on
washing
his
hands
until
they
were
ridged
and
sodden
in
the
hope
of
hearing
what
they
were
saying
or
even
of
entering
into
their
conversation
until
would
come
along
and
drag
him
off
to
asking
him
what
the
hell
he
was
dawdling
about
then
edwin
would
be
almost
ashamed
of
company
and
hated
himself
for
it
since
he
knew
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
even
if
he
were
a
philistine
was
one
of
the
best
and
soundest
fellows
on
earth
the
friendship
with
boyce
however
was
bound
to
come
it
began
with
the
formation
of
a
small
literary
society
that
had
been
originated
by
certain
of
the
men
with
whom
boyce
was
acquainted
and
which
held
its
meetings
in
the
smoking
room
that
adjoined
chamber
of
horrors
papers
were
read
every
fortnight
and
discussions
followed
in
which
edwin
had
scarcely
dared
to
take
part
but
boyce
was
a
polished
and
fluent
protagonist
in
the
end
when
the
first
enthusiasms
of
the
society
to
which
brown
and
maskew
naturally
enough
did
not
belong
had
been
spent
edwin
was
asked
to
read
a
paper
he
chose
for
his
subject
a
work
with
which
this
medical
audience
seemed
strangely
unacquainted
the
paper
was
a
success
and
at
the
end
of
the
meeting
boyce
accosted
him
friendlily
and
asked
him
why
he
had
never
been
up
to
see
his
books
edwin
withheld
the
obvious
reply
that
the
invitation
had
not
been
pressed
although
he
had
never
ceased
to
think
of
it
and
boyce
at
once
suggested
that
they
should
go
up
to
alvaston
together
that
evening
can
put
you
up
for
the
night
if
that
will
be
more
convenient
he
said
they
walked
up
together
under
the
high
frosty
sky
talking
of
poetry
of
all
the
beautiful
things
that
they
had
worshipped
in
common
without
knowing
it
it
seemed
strange
to
edwin
that
they
should
have
worked
side
by
side
for
a
couple
of
years
and
scarcely
spoken
to
each
other
when
all
the
time
they
had
so
many
delights
that
might
have
been
shared
the
unlocking
of
this
closed
and
secret
chamber
of
his
heart
gave
him
a
strange
feeling
of
elation
and
made
the
world
suddenly
beautiful
the
hard
and
wintry
pavement
seemed
curiously
smooth
and
resilient
the
roadway
ran
in
masterly
and
noble
curves
the
black
branches
of
and
laburnums
even
the
pointed
gables
of
the
smug
suburban
villas
seemed
to
take
on
a
new
and
piercing
beauty
against
the
starry
sky
and
they
swung
along
together
as
triumphant
in
their
ecstasy
of
youth
as
if
indeed
they
were
treading
on
the
stars
a
topping
night
said
boyce
look
at
vega
he
waved
his
long
arms
and
quoted
search
the
brow
of
eve
to
catch
in
opal
depths
the
first
faint
beat
of
fiery
heart
is
that
a
tremendous
chap
on
damned
good
said
edwin
thrilling
bad
is
it
a
very
sound
man
the
guvnor
i
think
like
but
when
they
reached
the
house
they
found
that
the
poet
was
not
at
home
in
place
of
him
edwin
was
introduced
to
a
mild
and
beautiful
figure
with
a
soft
voice
who
turned
out
to
be
mother
she
had
her
soft
blue
eyes
and
spoke
to
him
with
such
caressing
tenderness
that
edwin
was
seized
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
aching
emptiness
for
the
memory
of
his
own
mother
of
whom
so
potent
is
the
anodyne
of
time
he
had
scarcely
thought
for
more
than
a
year
boyce
presented
edwin
with
a
high
social
recommendation
friend
of
denis
he
said
boyce
smiled
on
him
here
said
her
son
afraid
we
very
well
go
into
the
study
he
hates
any
one
invading
it
when
not
there
go
upstairs
to
my
own
room
and
edwin
had
a
passing
vision
of
the
forbidden
chamber
the
flanks
of
a
grand
piano
in
which
a
reflection
of
firelight
glowed
red
and
endless
shelves
of
books
the
rest
of
the
house
seemed
to
him
rather
untidy
as
if
it
were
no
more
than
a
dry
chrysalis
protecting
the
central
beauty
of
the
room
but
he
had
not
time
to
see
much
following
in
the
rear
of
progress
up
the
stairs
he
found
himself
at
last
in
a
small
attic
with
a
gable
window
that
framed
the
starry
sky
the
kind
of
room
that
satisfied
all
his
own
ideals
of
comfort
and
seclusion
boyce
was
proud
and
willing
to
exhibit
his
treasures
they
showed
a
curious
mixture
of
the
schoolboy
represented
by
photographic
groups
of
cricket
teams
glass
cases
of
butterflies
and
a
tasseled
rugby
cap
and
the
more
mature
intelligence
that
now
possessed
them
edwin
and
he
sat
down
opposite
one
another
in
a
couple
of
and
talked
and
smoked
incessantly
all
that
evening
they
spoke
of
wordsworth
the
idol
of
literary
devotions
of
browning
whose
claims
to
poetry
he
would
not
allow
and
of
shenstone
whose
name
he
had
never
met
before
by
this
time
edwin
was
getting
rather
ashamed
of
his
early
admiration
for
shenstone
and
the
fact
that
boyce
had
never
heard
of
the
pastoral
ballad
confirmed
him
in
his
decision
that
the
author
was
an
acquaintance
whom
he
had
better
drop
they
went
on
to
francis
quotation
from
the
of
had
sent
edwin
searching
for
his
works
in
the
municipal
he
now
learned
that
this
bewildering
genius
who
had
once
like
him
been
a
medical
student
had
actually
slept
in
the
room
beneath
his
feet
never
qualified
said
boyce
dreamily
yet
medicine
is
a
wonderful
thing
i
should
think
the
fact
that
the
medical
man
is
always
face
to
face
with
pointed
to
a
suspended
skeleton
in
the
all
the
other
big
fundamental
things
like
birth
and
pain
ought
to
give
him
a
sort
of
sense
of
proportion
and
make
him
sensitive
to
the
beauties
of
life
your
friend
sir
thomas
browne
is
an
example
then
are
heaps
of
others
said
edwin
and
akenside
edwin
supplied
from
the
eighteenth
century
know
the
gentleman
said
boyce
then
goldsmith
and
crabbe
rather
good
you
know
and
shelley
walked
a
hospital
when
he
was
in
london
with
no
idea
of
that
said
boyce
a
modern
fellow
that
the
rather
keen
on
named
bridges
robert
bridges
a
never
heard
of
not
well
known
but
i
believe
pretty
and
so
they
talked
on
deciding
that
the
world
was
ripe
for
great
poetical
achievement
awed
to
think
that
perhaps
they
were
living
without
knowing
it
in
the
beginning
of
a
great
age
of
literature
convinced
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
of
the
splendour
and
magnanimity
of
the
calling
that
they
had
adopted
the
fact
that
the
whole
world
lay
before
them
full
of
undreamed
delights
as
mysterious
and
yet
as
clear
as
the
wintry
sky
edwin
had
to
run
for
his
train
he
mind
running
on
a
night
like
this
he
felt
that
violent
exercise
was
a
mode
of
expressing
the
curious
elation
that
his
talk
with
boyce
and
his
excitement
in
the
new
friendship
that
promised
so
many
hours
of
happiness
had
given
him
at
the
gates
of
the
station
he
paused
to
buy
an
evening
paper
it
contained
the
news
of
defeat
at
colenso
and
the
result
of
a
between
north
bromwich
albion
and
notts
forest
but
he
had
no
room
in
his
mind
for
football
or
for
this
african
war
in
which
to
the
ruin
of
his
future
finances
was
itching
to
enlist
thoughts
were
of
the
great
names
and
the
great
works
of
which
he
and
boyce
had
been
talking
the
newspaper
lay
folded
on
his
knees
the
flares
of
the
black
country
swept
past
him
in
the
night
unseen
he
was
not
even
aware
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
carriage
until
he
suddenly
found
himself
staring
straight
into
the
eyes
of
his
opposite
whom
he
recognised
as
edward
willis
the
son
of
walter
willis
of
the
great
mawne
furnaces
all
aunt
attempts
heroically
made
in
the
interests
of
social
advancement
had
so
far
failed
to
bring
about
a
friendship
between
these
two
edwin
on
his
side
could
never
get
out
of
his
head
an
unreasonable
prejudice
against
the
willises
the
natural
result
of
aunt
adulation
of
their
wealth
and
even
a
knowledge
of
his
own
humble
origins
had
not
affected
his
traditional
distrust
of
people
whom
he
regarded
as
flashy
and
in
edward
willis
he
found
a
creature
even
more
shy
than
himself
and
the
very
fact
that
willis
and
aunt
laura
putting
their
heads
together
had
decided
to
throw
them
into
each
arms
was
enough
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
distrust
and
uneasiness
the
sudden
recognition
in
the
railway
carriage
was
merely
an
embarrassment
edwin
was
startled
into
saying
and
willis
replied
in
exactly
the
same
way
then
both
of
them
retired
with
precipitation
to
the
cover
of
their
evening
newspapers
from
which
they
listened
to
the
conversation
of
a
commercial
traveller
who
was
returning
home
from
london
and
had
all
the
latest
and
most
authentic
gossip
on
the
south
african
situation
you
he
said
wily
fellows
these
old
boers
we
may
not
be
up
to
their
dirty
tricks
proud
to
say
we
we
be
english
if
we
were
but
one
thing
sir
see
in
the
end
and
that
is
that
dogged
british
pluck
will
come
through
you
mark
my
edwin
felt
an
overpowering
impulse
to
say
that
dogged
british
pluck
pretty
obviously
come
through
at
colenso
but
edward
presence
made
him
far
too
to
commit
himself
and
at
the
next
station
the
traveller
and
his
friend
picked
up
their
bags
and
departed
breathing
the
word
as
if
it
were
an
incantation
warranted
to
fortify
and
console
edwin
and
willis
were
alone
when
their
silence
had
become
altogether
too
ridiculous
edwin
plucked
up
his
courage
and
said
thing
this
know
said
willis
all
right
for
my
old
do
you
mean
chock
full
of
government
work
for
south
africa
and
rifle
barrels
doing
medicine
you
devil
learning
to
cure
people
while
learning
to
make
things
to
kill
he
stared
out
of
the
window
towards
a
patch
of
sky
in
which
the
glow
of
his
furnaces
pulsated
as
though
it
registered
the
beatings
of
a
savage
fiery
heart
and
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
the
tunnel
swallowed
them
and
in
a
moment
they
pulled
up
at
mawne
hall
willis
prepared
to
go
say
he
said
giving
a
dance
next
and
hesitated
for
said
edwin
for
want
of
something
better
know
unless
to
celebrate
the
colenso
casualties
i
believe
invited
i
hope
said
edwin
but
willis
was
gone
chapter
v
romance
i
ingleby
wanted
to
know
why
he
was
so
late
read
a
paper
at
the
literary
society
he
said
then
went
back
to
alvaston
with
a
man
named
boyce
a
son
of
arthur
auctioneer
asked
ingleby
the
features
showed
a
faint
anxiety
as
though
he
doubted
if
such
an
influence
were
healthy
i
hope
your
paper
was
a
success
he
said
i
think
it
went
all
right
any
letters
two
here
they
he
handed
them
to
edwin
one
of
them
was
the
invitation
from
mawne
he
showed
it
to
his
father
said
ingleby
i
suppose
better
aunt
laura
told
me
about
it
if
it
interfere
with
your
work
i
see
why
you
any
proper
clothes
evening
dress
you
suppose
that
is
quite
necessary
said
ingleby
regretfully
edwin
could
see
that
the
question
of
expense
was
troubling
his
mind
he
wished
to
goodness
he
would
say
so
outright
instead
of
looking
vaguely
distressed
it
would
be
so
much
more
satisfactory
as
it
was
he
could
only
feel
indefinitely
in
the
wrong
as
if
the
dance
were
a
piece
of
reckless
and
inexcusable
levity
in
which
he
had
no
right
to
take
a
part
the
dress
suit
the
acquisition
of
which
had
been
anticipated
with
some
satisfaction
now
appeared
to
him
in
the
terms
of
an
accumulation
of
small
change
hardly
earned
in
his
dusty
shop
as
the
outcome
of
pennyworths
of
epsom
salts
sticks
of
liquorice
or
teething
powders
it
was
humiliating
and
even
distressing
to
realise
that
every
single
comfort
or
luxury
that
he
the
prime
necessities
of
life
had
to
be
accumulated
literally
scraped
together
from
this
incredibly
humble
source
and
by
the
personal
exertions
of
this
simple
and
pathetic
person
with
these
conditions
in
his
mind
he
could
not
bear
accepting
money
from
his
father
the
weight
of
his
obligation
was
so
overwhelming
now
he
found
it
difficult
to
face
the
idea
of
a
bill
that
might
represent
the
profit
on
at
least
three
days
of
small
trading
in
the
shop
think
better
go
father
he
said
would
be
rather
ungracious
if
you
edwin
his
father
replied
was
extremely
kind
of
the
willises
to
ask
you
i
think
better
go
and
be
measured
by
the
idea
of
a
halesby
cut
was
not
inspiring
and
made
edwin
inclined
to
press
his
refusal
but
ingleby
went
on
to
explain
that
jones
owed
him
a
bill
that
he
had
begun
to
look
upon
as
a
bad
debt
and
that
dress
suit
would
be
a
way
of
working
it
off
this
circumstance
made
the
order
less
shameful
except
in
so
far
as
it
applied
to
the
hateful
penury
of
jones
whom
edwin
remembered
as
a
man
with
a
beard
as
shabbily
unlike
a
dummy
as
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
be
the
occurrence
was
unfortunate
in
another
way
for
such
an
addition
to
his
wardrobe
would
almost
certainly
scotch
the
idea
of
asking
for
a
dress
allowance
a
plan
which
had
been
maturing
in
his
brain
for
some
months
and
only
needed
a
callous
frame
of
mind
for
its
performance
next
evening
however
he
went
to
see
jones
who
measured
him
obsequiously
and
assured
him
that
in
the
happy
days
before
he
was
his
own
master
he
had
actually
cut
for
sir
joseph
astill
a
gentleman
who
was
very
difficult
to
fit
on
account
of
a
slight
er
fullness
in
the
figure
edwin
primed
by
the
observations
of
the
major
in
was
able
to
tell
jones
exactly
what
he
wanted
and
manner
when
he
rubbed
his
hands
over
instructions
did
not
suggest
for
a
moment
the
fact
of
which
edwin
was
all
the
time
aware
that
this
was
not
a
order
but
a
rather
shabby
way
of
making
him
pay
a
bill
that
he
had
scamped
for
a
couple
of
years
stepping
out
of
melancholy
shop
edwin
thanked
heaven
that
his
father
had
not
wanted
him
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
life
of
a
struggling
tradesman
in
a
small
town
must
be
the
most
humiliating
on
earth
he
was
awfully
sorry
for
all
of
them
as
he
walked
down
the
street
and
read
their
names
on
the
boards
above
their
windows
he
had
never
quite
realised
their
condition
before
he
smelt
the
particular
odour
of
lower
poverty
vaguely
suggestive
of
perambulators
aspidistras
and
boiled
mutton
that
moved
down
the
linoleum
floored
passage
at
the
back
of
shop
in
due
course
the
clothes
arrived
on
the
whole
jones
had
not
done
badly
but
even
so
edwin
was
still
scarcely
qualified
for
the
business
in
hand
he
had
never
learned
to
dance
and
it
was
necessary
to
acquire
this
accomplishment
in
a
little
more
than
a
week
at
first
he
had
decided
to
pull
his
courage
together
and
approach
martin
whose
eligibility
compelled
him
to
be
an
expert
dancing
man
but
at
the
last
moment
he
funked
a
confession
that
would
expose
such
depths
of
social
ignorance
and
went
instead
to
a
certain
professor
beagle
who
advertised
classes
in
dancing
and
deportment
at
the
hour
of
five
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
in
the
assembly
rooms
next
door
to
the
theatre
of
the
same
name
on
the
next
tuesday
afternoon
edwin
presented
himself
to
beagle
at
the
advertised
hour
he
found
him
alone
sitting
on
a
platform
at
the
end
of
a
long
room
that
smelt
of
dust
and
rep
curtains
when
edwin
appeared
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
professor
dismounted
cleared
his
throat
clasped
his
hands
in
front
of
him
and
made
a
formal
bow
he
was
a
little
man
and
very
fat
he
wore
a
navy
blue
coat
that
was
cut
very
short
at
the
back
so
that
it
ruckled
up
over
his
round
haunches
and
his
collar
rose
so
high
and
stiff
above
a
white
ascot
tie
that
he
was
forced
to
carry
his
head
tilted
backwards
in
the
direction
of
his
waxed
moustache
his
face
was
purple
and
his
watery
eyes
stared
whether
as
the
result
of
the
asphyxiation
or
his
past
manner
of
life
it
was
difficult
to
say
his
feet
were
excessively
small
and
his
striped
grey
trousers
tapered
to
the
ankles
in
such
a
way
that
every
step
he
made
seemed
a
nice
feat
of
balancing
he
bowed
to
edwin
and
edwin
explained
the
urgent
circumstances
of
his
mission
see
said
professor
beagle
quite
understand
you
must
not
expect
me
to
be
able
to
turn
you
out
as
i
should
wish
to
in
the
time
at
our
disposal
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
not
to
mention
my
name
in
this
connection
and
keep
my
instructions
as
it
were
dark
edwin
assured
him
of
secrecy
and
the
professor
proceeded
to
ask
him
where
the
dance
was
to
be
held
do
not
wish
to
teach
you
anything
that
will
not
be
useful
he
said
some
circles
the
quadrille
which
i
myself
consider
the
most
dignified
of
dances
is
still
in
favour
in
others
the
valeta
is
coming
into
vogue
in
different
planes
of
society
different
conditions
in
the
end
the
professor
decided
that
case
called
for
the
waltz
the
lancers
and
the
polka
with
the
possible
addition
of
the
pas
de
quatre
he
demonstrated
to
edwin
the
position
in
which
his
feet
should
be
placed
and
then
invited
him
to
have
a
try
at
the
waltz
will
take
my
harm
please
in
the
following
way
now
neither
grarsping
nor
clarsping
let
the
lie
gently
in
yours
with
the
fingers
bent
and
under
no
circumstances
squeeze
the
figger
so
edwin
placed
his
right
arm
above
the
ruckles
in
professor
broad
back
into
his
left
hand
a
podgy
fist
descended
like
a
lump
of
moist
dough
and
from
the
little
strangled
head
a
faint
sound
of
whistling
proceeded
that
raked
own
nostrils
with
a
of
whisky
and
cachous
then
the
professor
began
to
revolve
like
a
peg
top
and
edwin
felt
himself
swept
round
by
the
arm
that
lay
upon
his
shoulder
to
the
rhythm
of
the
whistled
tune
which
was
sometimes
suspended
and
replaced
by
gently
now
in
this
manner
they
circled
the
room
several
times
edwin
was
getting
out
of
breath
but
the
professor
to
whom
this
form
of
exercise
was
so
usual
as
to
be
negligible
showed
no
signs
of
fatigue
except
that
his
eyes
became
a
little
more
glassy
and
his
cheeks
more
purple
indeed
the
power
by
which
he
swung
edwin
round
the
room
was
a
thing
of
mystery
for
his
little
feet
did
not
seem
to
move
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
was
rigid
he
moved
like
a
cyclone
or
a
edwin
thought
revolving
terrifically
on
its
own
axis
am
afraid
said
professor
beagle
formally
at
the
end
of
the
first
lesson
am
afraid
you
have
no
great
natural
gift
it
is
better
that
i
should
be
candid
with
you
you
will
need
half
a
dozen
lessons
at
least
before
you
can
take
your
place
with
the
young
ladies
in
one
of
my
advanced
edwin
stuck
to
it
on
six
more
occasions
he
visited
the
assembly
rooms
where
with
exactly
the
same
formalities
beagle
received
him
with
beagle
in
his
arms
prevented
by
sheer
physical
bulk
from
in
any
circumstances
squeezing
the
figger
he
revolved
in
the
vortex
of
the
waltz
in
the
lancers
he
set
to
imaginary
partners
or
went
with
hand
lying
gently
in
his
with
the
fingers
bent
in
the
pas
de
quatre
where
the
draught
of
whisky
and
cachous
was
happily
directed
forwards
he
pointed
an
awkward
toe
alongside
tapered
and
elegant
extremity
in
the
end
the
professor
pronounced
himself
satisfied
with
him
i
were
you
he
said
think
i
should
come
along
to
my
advanced
class
this
evening
and
familiarise
yourself
with
the
proximity
of
young
ladies
the
fee
is
a
purely
nominal
edwin
decided
to
do
so
and
walked
up
in
the
evening
with
his
patent
leather
pumps
in
his
pocket
he
felt
very
shy
the
place
was
lighted
with
flaring
gas
jets
and
in
a
room
marked
gentlemen
that
he
had
always
taken
for
a
lavatory
a
number
of
young
men
who
looked
like
shop
assistants
were
putting
on
white
kid
gloves
they
all
seemed
to
know
one
another
and
to
look
upon
edwin
as
an
intruder
no
one
spoke
to
him
and
he
waited
in
the
cloak
room
until
the
last
had
disappeared
before
he
dared
to
emerge
from
the
room
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
passage
there
issued
a
breeze
of
concentrated
perfumes
and
a
round
of
subdued
titters
this
room
was
labelled
while
edwin
stood
waiting
and
wondering
if
he
dare
risk
an
encounter
the
door
opposite
opened
and
a
bevy
of
bloused
figures
appeared
the
sight
of
the
first
took
him
by
surprise
it
was
the
elder
of
the
two
anæmic
young
ladies
in
the
drapery
who
travelled
in
the
morning
train
with
him
from
halesby
she
gave
him
a
smile
of
recognition
that
revealed
her
defective
teeth
this
prospect
was
altogether
too
much
for
him
an
acute
shyness
drove
him
back
into
the
cloak
room
and
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
off
his
pumps
and
put
on
his
shoes
again
he
left
the
assembly
rooms
and
bolted
down
sackville
row
to
his
train
ii
the
dance
to
which
edwin
had
looked
forward
with
such
mingled
pleasure
and
anxiety
was
destined
to
bring
forth
a
violent
emotional
experience
jones
had
not
undergone
the
experience
of
cutting
for
the
undulant
figure
of
sir
joseph
hingston
for
nothing
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
sleeves
were
rather
too
long
for
his
arms
dress
coat
was
a
success
and
as
aunt
laura
benignantly
pointed
out
it
was
just
as
well
that
some
allowance
should
be
made
for
future
growth
jones
had
been
extremely
anxious
that
edwin
should
be
supplied
with
a
magenta
silk
handkerchief
an
ornament
which
he
was
assured
all
the
best
people
wore
stuffed
in
the
corner
of
their
waistcoats
on
this
problem
the
major
had
never
delivered
judgment
so
edwin
mustered
sufficient
courage
to
approach
denis
martin
for
advice
martin
scornfully
told
him
that
the
idea
was
preposterous
the
kind
of
that
your
friend
maskew
would
adopt
he
said
he
also
impressed
upon
edwin
the
fact
that
the
infallible
index
of
a
bounder
in
was
a
tie
no
doubt
the
advice
was
excellent
but
it
let
edwin
in
for
an
hour
of
agony
on
the
evening
of
the
dance
when
the
tie
refused
to
answer
to
the
printed
instructions
and
finished
up
by
making
him
look
as
if
he
had
gone
to
bed
in
his
boots
and
slept
on
it
he
had
never
been
to
mawne
hall
before
that
pretentious
mansion
with
its
castellated
façade
set
on
a
steep
bank
above
the
valley
of
the
stour
in
which
the
works
that
maintained
it
lay
was
so
brightly
lit
upon
this
evening
that
it
glowed
like
a
lantern
through
the
bare
boughs
of
the
hanging
wood
beneath
in
the
at
the
side
of
the
hall
in
which
the
hats
and
coats
of
the
guests
were
being
received
by
bassett
the
coachman
he
recognised
a
number
of
incredibly
elegant
creatures
of
his
own
sex
with
shining
white
waistcoats
pearl
studs
and
immaculate
ties
he
knew
scarcely
any
of
them
for
they
were
mostly
neighbouring
ironmasters
or
professional
people
to
whose
society
the
money
had
proved
a
sufficient
introduction
among
them
he
recognised
sir
joseph
hingston
playing
ducks
and
drakes
with
his
aitches
and
wearing
to
encouragement
a
flagrantly
tie
in
this
particular
at
any
rate
he
was
one
up
on
the
baronet
he
hoped
that
some
one
else
would
realise
this
fact
in
the
middle
of
these
reflections
he
thought
he
heard
a
voice
that
he
recognised
and
turned
to
find
himself
rubbing
shoulders
with
griffin
edwin
said
lord
ingleby
are
you
here
i
seen
you
since
the
pantomime
night
what
are
you
doing
here
do
you
know
these
people
it
struck
edwin
that
he
spoke
rather
contemptuously
of
his
hosts
i
live
near
here
you
know
he
replied
know
the
willises
were
friends
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
knew
nothing
about
the
friends
but
it
sounded
rather
well
i
know
them
said
griffin
the
old
man
is
a
business
friend
of
my
and
apparently
they
were
rather
hard
up
for
the
sound
of
waltz
music
was
heard
and
griffin
left
him
hurriedly
you
later
he
said
edwin
anxious
not
to
be
left
behind
pulled
on
his
gloves
and
split
the
thumb
of
one
of
them
he
passed
through
the
hall
where
his
name
was
announced
rather
contemptuously
as
he
thought
by
hannah
the
tall
and
starchy
servant
and
was
received
in
a
manner
that
was
reassuring
and
homely
by
willis
she
spoke
for
a
moment
of
his
mother
and
tears
gathered
in
her
rather
watery
eyes
then
she
introduced
him
to
her
small
daughter
lilian
very
in
a
white
party
frock
with
a
pale
blue
waistband
and
another
dark
girl
with
beautiful
grey
eyes
and
a
creamy
rather
than
pale
complexion
who
was
standing
beside
her
miss
dorothy
powys
she
said
edwin
hedging
for
safety
booked
a
dance
with
lilian
who
took
the
matter
as
seriously
as
himself
next
no
doubt
he
must
have
a
shot
at
miss
dorothy
powys
in
spite
of
the
disturbing
beauty
of
her
eyes
but
when
he
came
to
ask
her
for
a
dance
he
saw
that
griffin
was
talking
to
her
i
have
sixteen
edwin
heard
him
ask
easily
she
smiled
and
nodded
her
smile
seemed
to
edwin
very
beautiful
so
beautiful
indeed
that
he
possibly
bring
himself
to
approach
her
when
griffin
turned
away
it
was
awfully
silly
of
him
he
thought
the
evening
was
not
exactly
a
success
he
polkaed
with
lilian
and
took
his
place
in
the
lancers
with
several
mature
ladies
to
whom
willis
introduced
him
luckily
none
of
these
belonged
to
halesby
a
circumstance
that
must
be
attributed
to
tact
so
that
the
question
of
his
origin
never
arose
he
danced
according
to
the
letter
of
professor
instructions
neither
grasping
nor
clasping
he
let
the
hands
lie
gently
in
his
with
the
fingers
half
bent
and
in
no
circumstances
did
he
squeeze
the
figger
what
he
missed
was
the
terrific
motive
power
that
the
unladylike
professor
beagle
had
applied
to
his
revolutions
it
now
appeared
to
him
that
to
supply
this
was
the
part
of
the
male
and
as
most
of
the
matrons
with
whom
willis
supplied
him
were
bulky
he
had
his
work
cut
out
once
returning
thoroughly
blown
from
one
of
these
adventures
he
caught
the
eye
of
dorothy
powys
and
he
thought
she
smiled
could
this
be
true
he
during
the
greater
part
of
the
evening
when
he
had
not
been
dancing
he
had
found
himself
following
her
movements
with
his
eyes
he
had
decided
that
she
must
be
at
least
a
year
or
two
older
than
himself
but
that
really
matter
for
she
seemed
to
him
a
creature
of
such
very
perfect
grace
and
her
eyes
in
the
moment
when
he
caught
them
had
been
so
wonderful
after
the
next
dance
which
was
the
one
that
she
had
booked
with
griffin
he
watched
them
disappear
into
the
library
it
made
him
feel
sick
with
himself
that
he
taken
the
opportunity
of
his
introduction
what
a
damned
fool
he
was
and
afterwards
when
he
watched
her
she
did
not
smile
at
all
either
for
him
or
for
any
one
else
indeed
she
seemed
pale
and
anxious
as
if
something
had
happened
to
upset
her
in
despair
edwin
wandered
off
into
the
where
he
saw
lady
hingston
who
was
partnering
willis
at
bridge
revoke
three
times
in
two
games
to
the
intense
annoyance
of
her
husband
from
the
he
strolled
on
to
the
buffet
where
he
found
griffin
absorbing
quantities
of
whisky
and
soda
he
begged
edwin
to
join
him
but
edwin
who
was
particularly
anxious
to
behave
himself
struck
to
have
you
struck
any
cuddle
said
griffin
brutally
with
his
mouth
full
what
what
the
devil
do
you
think
one
comes
to
a
dance
for
i
said
edwin
they
are
a
pretty
scratch
lot
griffin
confessed
powys
all
right
edwin
blushed
furiously
he
suddenly
wanted
to
throw
his
glass
of
at
head
why
he
calmed
himself
you
know
her
he
asked
met
her
before
got
a
topping
figure
she
must
be
pretty
well
connected
lord
alfred
powys
is
one
of
their
directors
you
mean
to
edwin
began
night
is
yet
young
said
griffin
gulping
another
whisky
number
twelve
i
must
hook
edwin
wandered
back
to
the
ballroom
he
keep
away
from
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
anxious
not
to
appear
disengaged
for
fear
that
willis
should
induce
some
other
heavy
partner
to
abandon
her
for
his
amusement
he
hung
about
the
pillars
of
the
folding
doors
that
led
into
the
supper
room
just
out
of
range
of
maternal
gaze
from
this
point
he
could
watch
the
beautiful
miss
powys
and
wonder
with
a
sort
of
bitter
excitement
exactly
what
griffin
had
meant
by
his
suggestions
watching
her
he
could
not
believe
that
she
could
be
anything
but
graceful
and
beautiful
in
everything
she
did
the
band
started
to
play
the
music
for
waltz
number
sixteen
he
remembered
it
was
the
second
dance
that
griffin
had
booked
with
her
for
some
reason
that
he
imagine
he
felt
that
he
wanted
to
be
near
when
griffin
came
for
her
perhaps
he
could
tell
her
attitude
towards
him
by
something
that
she
might
say
he
went
over
to
the
place
where
she
was
sitting
next
to
willis
he
tried
not
to
look
at
her
in
a
moment
he
heard
voice
i
the
tone
was
a
little
blurred
by
potations
think
made
a
mistake
she
said
edwin
turned
round
and
at
the
same
moment
she
looked
towards
him
i
am
dancing
this
with
you
look
here
sure
these
are
your
initials
on
my
programme
miss
powys
let
me
look
at
he
tried
to
take
the
programme
from
her
fingers
but
she
moved
it
away
we
contradict
each
other
griffin
the
dance
is
will
you
take
me
please
she
said
to
edwin
in
an
ecstatic
dream
edwin
found
himself
walking
away
with
her
on
his
arm
it
was
a
miracle
an
astounding
beautiful
miracle
she
picked
up
her
skirt
by
the
loop
of
ribbon
with
which
it
was
suspended
and
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
smiling
we
start
she
said
they
started
in
one
fatal
moment
edwin
who
been
doing
badly
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
forgot
every
single
precept
that
professor
beagle
had
taught
him
say
what
a
shocking
dancer
you
are
she
said
with
a
laugh
most
awfully
sorry
i
only
learnt
this
now
that
his
mind
was
diverted
by
speaking
to
her
the
steps
came
more
naturally
better
she
said
on
earth
taught
you
he
confessed
to
professor
beagle
and
she
appeared
to
be
amused
see
dancing
away
from
me
all
the
time
just
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
me
you
ought
to
hold
me
closer
it
upsets
the
what
call
it
centre
of
was
told
never
under
any
circumstances
he
very
well
repeat
professor
formula
getting
on
beautifully
think
about
it
the
idea
just
the
music
ended
would
you
like
to
go
he
asked
into
the
hall
if
you
mind
on
the
stairs
i
want
to
explain
to
you
it
was
really
awfully
good
of
you
to
take
me
was
a
wonderful
piece
of
luck
for
they
sat
together
on
the
shallow
oak
staircase
and
she
proceeded
to
tell
him
that
griffin
had
upset
her
in
the
dance
before
by
trying
to
kiss
her
shoulder
really
stick
a
repetition
of
that
she
said
i
think
the
man
had
been
drinking
so
i
just
pitched
upon
your
poor
innocence
and
lied
for
all
i
was
worth
who
are
you
by
the
way
i
only
just
remembered
your
name
when
willis
introduced
us
rather
a
dear
she
the
music
of
the
next
dance
struck
up
you
dancing
edwin
asked
eagerly
know
i
expect
so
just
look
at
my
programme
too
dark
for
me
to
edwin
took
the
programme
from
her
fingers
it
was
a
thrilling
moment
in
the
dusk
he
deciphered
two
initials
he
said
only
edward
willis
very
shy
of
me
if
nothing
better
to
do
i
think
stay
it
was
so
easy
to
talk
to
her
to
edwin
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
now
become
articulate
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
she
did
not
speak
very
much
of
herself
but
she
asked
him
many
questions
about
his
life
at
school
where
he
confided
to
her
he
had
first
known
griffin
and
then
again
about
his
new
work
in
north
bromwich
and
when
she
did
speak
her
voice
was
low
and
her
speech
to
his
ears
of
an
amazing
limpid
purity
more
beautiful
than
any
human
speech
he
had
ever
heard
edwin
would
have
liked
to
listen
to
it
for
ever
he
felt
that
he
wanted
words
to
describe
its
peculiar
music
but
no
words
came
to
him
he
could
only
remember
a
line
in
voice
was
as
the
voice
of
his
own
soul
heard
in
the
calm
of
thought
that
was
the
nearest
he
could
get
to
it
but
the
words
although
they
expressed
a
little
of
his
absorption
did
not
convey
the
musical
qualities
that
he
wanted
to
describe
he
tried
to
compare
it
with
the
tones
of
some
instrument
that
he
knew
but
neither
nor
strings
suggested
what
he
wanted
no
it
was
a
sound
nearer
to
nature
than
any
instrument
it
was
the
voice
of
a
naiad
the
sound
of
running
water
in
a
clear
brookland
and
all
the
time
that
he
listened
to
her
he
was
thrillingly
conscious
of
her
physical
presence
she
was
sitting
on
the
stair
beneath
him
and
fortunately
she
could
not
see
that
he
was
gazing
at
her
in
the
gloom
thinking
how
beautifully
shaped
was
the
nape
of
the
neck
from
which
her
dark
hair
was
drawn
upwards
overcome
by
the
loveliness
and
smoothness
of
her
curved
shoulder
talking
all
the
time
he
said
saying
nothing
rather
a
shame
because
you
speak
so
do
you
mean
for
a
moment
her
eyes
were
on
his
he
dared
not
look
at
them
he
could
not
answer
her
for
the
moment
seemed
full
of
such
an
overpowering
sweetness
tell
i
only
mean
that
when
you
say
a
thing
like
that
it
it
suggests
that
everything
about
you
is
marvellously
clean
and
clear
and
he
paused
for
he
felt
that
she
might
laugh
at
him
go
on
she
said
water
in
a
hill
country
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
within
a
hundred
miles
of
north
she
laughed
softly
but
not
unkindly
not
a
bit
like
that
really
awfully
hard
and
wish
i
were
the
least
bit
what
you
imagine
most
awfully
young
you
perhaps
she
did
not
mean
the
word
cruelly
but
it
seemed
very
cruel
to
edwin
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
was
a
few
years
older
than
himself
if
age
were
to
be
counted
by
years
but
in
reality
he
knew
that
she
was
beautifully
young
certainly
young
enough
to
love
and
to
be
loved
talk
about
me
she
said
i
want
to
talk
about
he
wanted
to
talk
about
nothing
else
his
head
was
full
of
words
that
he
wanted
to
throw
before
her
like
jewels
but
he
did
not
know
how
much
he
dared
to
say
he
knew
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
express
a
hundredth
part
of
his
delight
in
her
it
would
be
nearly
as
bad
as
kissing
her
neck
in
the
manner
of
griffin
to
say
that
the
curve
of
it
sent
him
delirious
with
joy
it
would
be
indecency
rather
than
candour
to
say
that
the
faint
scent
of
her
intoxicated
him
he
was
silent
with
tremulous
emotion
he
wondered
if
she
could
be
conscious
of
it
and
he
could
not
guess
for
she
too
did
not
speak
from
the
ballroom
they
heard
the
music
of
another
dance
begin
two
shadowy
couples
emerged
from
the
passage
beneath
them
a
curtain
of
indian
beading
made
a
sound
like
dead
leaves
driven
over
a
dry
pavement
by
the
wind
the
voices
died
away
suppose
we
must
go
too
she
said
with
a
sigh
must
you
go
are
you
dancing
edwin
asked
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
i
think
i
shall
dance
any
more
i
was
rather
upset
it
was
silly
of
me
but
i
think
better
edwin
offered
her
his
arm
in
the
best
manner
of
professor
beagle
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
she
was
smiling
and
her
eyes
were
wonderful
in
the
gloom
their
faces
were
level
with
each
other
and
suddenly
amazingly
she
kissed
him
going
she
said
edwin
tried
to
take
her
hand
as
she
moved
away
from
him
for
a
second
it
lay
in
his
soft
and
small
and
warm
then
before
his
arms
had
time
to
follow
the
impulse
of
his
flaming
brain
she
had
slipped
away
from
him
and
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
passage
he
stood
there
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
alone
his
heart
thudding
like
a
in
a
bewildered
intoxicating
elation
why
had
she
left
him
why
unless
it
were
only
a
part
of
her
adorable
modesty
that
must
be
the
reason
and
yet
it
was
hardly
consistent
with
an
exalted
ideal
of
modesty
to
kiss
a
young
man
whom
she
had
only
known
for
fifteen
minutes
on
the
lips
a
new
aspect
of
the
miracle
presented
itself
to
him
was
it
possible
after
all
that
griffin
had
been
right
that
she
was
really
exactly
what
he
had
insinuated
a
fast
little
baggage
who
had
determined
in
a
sudden
caprice
to
throw
griffin
over
and
try
a
new
experiment
he
could
not
believe
it
everything
that
he
had
noticed
and
adored
in
her
her
grey
eyes
the
delicious
quality
of
her
speech
her
fragrance
the
indescribable
was
no
other
word
for
her
denied
the
possibility
he
found
it
difficult
to
realise
that
she
had
gone
in
the
moment
of
such
an
astounding
revelation
such
was
the
way
of
a
naiad
melting
away
out
of
her
sweet
mortality
in
the
moment
of
possession
standing
alone
at
the
foot
of
the
gloomy
staircase
listening
in
a
dream
to
the
luscious
music
of
the
waltz
he
tried
to
recreate
his
dream
out
of
memory
nothing
of
her
was
left
but
her
delicate
perfume
on
the
stairs
he
saw
a
small
crumpled
muslin
handkerchief
from
which
the
perfume
came
he
picked
it
up
with
the
reverence
of
a
pilgrim
touching
a
relic
eagerly
triumphant
that
he
had
managed
to
rescue
a
fragment
of
his
dream
it
did
not
strike
him
that
this
tiny
square
of
scented
muslin
was
presumably
the
instrument
with
which
divinity
blew
its
nose
and
indeed
its
dimensions
scarcely
fitted
it
for
this
material
function
he
placed
it
in
the
pocket
of
creation
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
it
lay
near
his
heart
this
of
course
was
only
the
beginning
of
a
romance
no
doubt
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
would
see
her
again
somehow
he
must
persuade
her
to
see
him
alone
and
then
he
would
be
able
to
do
all
the
magnificently
passionate
things
of
which
her
flight
had
cheated
him
he
would
kiss
her
he
would
hold
her
exquisiteness
in
his
arms
he
would
tell
her
all
the
glorious
things
that
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
withhold
he
went
back
into
the
ballroom
nobody
seemed
to
notice
him
there
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
these
ordinary
people
were
too
dull
in
their
perceptions
to
guess
at
the
wonder
in
his
heart
it
was
a
secret
that
he
shared
with
only
one
other
person
in
the
world
and
that
secret
had
altered
his
whole
outlook
on
life
he
was
no
longer
the
timid
boy
conscious
of
his
social
disadvantages
and
of
his
new
dress
clothes
who
had
entered
the
house
a
couple
of
hours
before
but
a
man
a
lover
to
whose
passion
the
whole
beauty
of
the
world
ministered
a
creature
miraculously
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
envy
or
of
scorn
he
was
happy
to
wait
patiently
for
the
supreme
moment
when
he
should
see
her
again
and
so
he
waited
mildly
tolerant
of
griffin
over
whom
he
had
scored
so
easily
of
edward
willis
who
performed
with
a
set
face
his
penitentiary
programme
of
of
willis
who
watched
the
joy
of
her
small
daughter
lilian
with
the
proud
but
anxious
eyes
of
a
mother
hen
of
willis
circulating
among
his
guests
with
an
expansive
smile
of
poor
lady
hingston
still
revoking
automatically
in
the
but
dorothy
powys
never
returned
to
the
seat
that
she
had
occupied
under
the
shadow
of
wings
she
had
told
him
that
she
mean
to
dance
any
more
but
surely
that
mean
that
he
was
not
to
see
her
again
he
grew
uneasy
of
course
she
could
easily
escape
if
she
wanted
to
do
so
for
she
was
staying
in
the
house
he
wondered
if
he
dared
ask
willis
what
had
become
of
her
but
decided
that
this
would
certainly
give
him
away
instead
of
doing
this
he
posted
himself
in
a
corner
from
which
he
could
hear
everything
that
was
said
in
circle
this
was
not
a
very
profitable
pursuit
for
willis
was
not
an
interesting
talker
and
the
only
excitement
that
penetrated
the
broody
calm
that
surrounded
her
was
the
arrival
of
her
husband
very
excited
over
a
telephone
message
that
had
no
foundation
in
fact
announcing
the
relief
of
ladysmith
by
general
buller
edwin
was
beginning
to
give
the
business
up
as
a
bad
job
when
he
saw
a
tall
languid
man
whom
he
considered
to
be
rather
shabbily
dressed
approach
willis
and
ask
her
what
had
happened
to
his
niece
she
was
here
half
an
hour
ago
said
willis
poor
child
told
me
that
she
had
a
headache
and
was
going
to
bed
i
told
hannah
to
take
her
a
hot
water
i
do
hope
quite
comfortable
lord
alfred
she
went
on
is
nice
it
to
see
all
these
young
people
enjoying
themselves
at
least
it
would
be
if
one
have
to
think
of
all
the
poor
creatures
in
south
africa
being
fired
at
by
these
treacherous
and
the
tall
shabby
man
mumbled
yes
very
in
his
beard
it
was
enough
for
edwin
he
said
to
willis
who
seemed
only
mildly
surprised
at
his
departure
and
left
the
house
there
was
no
reason
now
why
he
should
stay
on
the
stone
terrace
he
paused
listening
for
a
moment
to
the
muted
music
from
within
the
house
in
the
upper
stories
only
one
window
was
lighted
he
could
see
the
glowing
yellow
pane
beyond
a
bough
of
one
of
the
cedars
with
which
the
lawn
was
shaded
he
wondered
if
that
window
were
hers
he
would
like
he
thought
to
stay
there
all
night
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
cedar
gazing
at
that
window
and
feeling
that
he
was
near
her
later
on
no
doubt
the
light
would
be
extinguished
and
then
he
would
imagine
her
lying
there
asleep
how
beautiful
she
must
be
when
she
lay
there
sleeping
he
sighed
and
went
on
his
way
under
the
wonderful
night
he
climbed
the
steep
slope
of
mawne
bank
under
the
smouldering
in
a
dream
and
found
himself
surprised
beneath
the
walls
of
the
cherry
orchard
at
the
back
of
old
mawne
hall
inside
the
walls
the
lay
locked
in
a
wintry
sleep
he
stopped
for
the
steepness
of
the
hill
had
stolen
his
breath
he
remembered
a
day
when
he
walked
there
with
his
mother
mother
would
have
loved
her
he
thought
yes
she
was
more
wonderful
than
his
mother
on
the
day
that
he
remembered
so
many
years
ago
it
had
been
spring
the
branches
had
been
full
of
billowy
bloom
now
in
the
wintry
night
he
felt
that
spring
was
near
spring
was
in
his
blood
stirring
it
to
new
and
passionate
aspirations
as
in
a
few
months
time
it
would
stir
the
dreamy
sap
of
the
a
strange
unseasonable
miracle
glorious
indefinite
words
formed
themselves
in
his
mind
spring
with
its
warm
perfumed
breath
triumphing
beautifully
over
the
powers
of
winter
and
death
death
at
colenso
under
those
tawny
kopjes
love
in
his
heart
a
sublime
ecstatic
the
mawne
furnaces
leapt
into
a
sudden
flower
of
fire
that
made
the
sky
above
them
tawny
love
was
like
fire
an
exultant
leaping
flame
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
until
he
found
himself
at
home
in
his
little
shabby
room
taking
off
his
and
staring
at
himself
as
a
stranger
in
the
dusty
mirror
am
i
he
thought
this
should
have
happened
to
me
i
do
not
know
myself
i
am
greater
and
more
wonderful
than
the
image
that
i
see
in
the
he
placed
his
precious
talisman
of
muslin
under
his
pillow
and
wondered
if
he
might
be
blessed
with
a
dream
of
her
kissed
me
he
thought
kissed
my
iii
it
was
evident
that
if
he
were
to
see
her
again
he
must
make
friends
with
edward
willis
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
done
so
before
for
once
in
a
way
the
recommendations
of
aunt
laura
had
been
prophetically
right
his
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
do
so
for
he
felt
certain
that
this
cold
calculating
young
man
would
see
through
him
for
two
days
he
debated
with
himself
on
the
various
ways
in
which
mawne
might
be
approached
without
coming
to
any
satisfactory
conclusion
on
the
third
he
was
so
lucky
as
to
meet
his
victim
on
the
halesby
train
willis
did
not
seem
in
the
least
anxious
to
renew
their
acquaintance
and
it
was
at
the
expense
of
some
awkwardness
that
edwin
managed
to
drag
him
into
conversation
they
talked
a
little
about
the
war
which
willis
seemed
to
view
from
a
remote
and
pessimistic
angle
from
that
by
way
of
ladysmith
rumour
they
passed
on
to
a
discussion
of
the
dance
edwin
was
enthusiastic
glad
you
enjoyed
yourself
said
willis
hate
rather
admired
that
miss
powys
said
edwin
powys
yes
a
pretty
girl
she
is
she
a
niece
of
lord
alfred
powys
one
of
our
directors
lives
with
him
i
believe
i
really
know
she
staying
with
you
she
only
stayed
at
mawne
for
the
night
of
the
dance
her
uncle
happened
to
be
coming
over
for
a
meeting
and
the
governor
asked
him
to
bring
her
along
with
him
as
there
was
a
dance
this
was
all
very
discouraging
do
they
live
edwin
asked
over
in
the
teme
valley
i
think
lord
a
great
fisherman
a
nice
she
lives
with
him
i
think
sort
of
adopted
her
but
i
understand
going
to
india
sometime
next
what
on
earth
is
she
going
to
india
for
to
be
married
to
some
fellow
in
the
indian
army
a
major
i
think
he
be
said
edwin
and
the
train
pulled
up
at
mawne
hall
iv
he
took
it
very
hardly
on
the
face
of
it
it
seemed
that
her
kiss
had
been
no
more
than
a
piece
of
mad
cynical
trifling
but
his
respect
for
was
considerable
as
became
his
not
allow
him
to
believe
this
he
decided
instead
that
dorothy
kiss
had
been
the
symbol
of
a
great
and
noble
passion
fated
in
the
melancholy
manner
of
nearly
every
legendary
lore
to
frustration
he
was
convinced
that
the
unknown
major
in
the
indian
army
would
never
be
loved
that
the
memory
of
that
intense
moment
on
back
stairs
would
haunt
his
wife
for
ever
and
temper
with
romance
the
vistas
of
an
unhappy
marriage
the
main
result
of
the
incident
in
case
was
a
spate
of
passionate
but
imitative
verses
a
new
devotion
to
such
music
as
repressed
his
particular
portion
of
and
an
anxiety
to
confide
the
story
with
elaborations
to
some
sympathetic
friend
he
turned
it
on
to
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
asked
when
he
had
finished
sucked
at
his
pipe
and
smiled
luck
next
time
old
chap
he
said
chapter
vi
the
dresser
i
in
the
following
june
the
second
professional
examination
was
held
on
a
stifling
morning
when
the
blue
brick
pavements
of
north
bromwich
reflected
a
torrid
heat
and
a
warm
wind
blowing
like
a
sirocco
from
the
black
desert
outside
swept
the
streets
with
clouds
of
dust
edwin
maskew
and
waited
in
the
cloakroom
outside
the
office
to
see
the
results
of
the
examination
posted
maskew
was
the
only
one
of
the
three
who
showed
no
signs
of
nervousness
for
could
never
overcome
the
difficulty
of
expressing
his
thoughts
on
paper
and
edwin
had
passed
ten
minutes
of
purgatory
with
an
outside
examiner
in
the
anatomy
he
knew
on
the
other
hand
that
his
physiology
had
been
extraordinarily
good
and
put
his
faith
in
the
general
impression
of
intelligence
that
he
hoped
he
had
created
the
porter
came
out
with
the
lists
and
striding
to
meet
his
fate
like
some
homeric
hero
snatched
the
paper
from
his
hands
he
went
very
white
as
he
read
it
he
said
luck
if
down
said
maskew
sympathetically
not
down
he
still
looked
bewildered
edwin
took
the
paper
from
his
trembling
hands
as
he
had
expected
maskew
was
first
but
he
saw
that
he
himself
was
second
on
the
list
martin
had
ambled
through
respectively
somewhere
about
the
middle
and
harrop
were
last
and
last
but
one
he
pinned
the
list
on
the
it
was
an
exhilarating
moment
in
which
he
was
conscious
of
the
herculean
sweaty
handgrip
of
who
was
muttering
damned
if
we
all
deserve
talking
and
laughing
together
they
went
out
to
lunch
at
and
caught
the
next
train
down
to
evesham
where
the
coolness
of
the
glassy
avon
made
the
june
heat
more
tolerable
and
in
the
evening
blistered
with
rowing
and
sunshine
they
came
back
to
north
bromwich
dined
together
and
afterwards
went
to
a
it
was
wonderful
to
edwin
to
see
the
physical
elation
of
the
big
man
wanted
to
dance
like
a
child
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
maskew
restrained
him
from
smashing
a
window
in
sackville
row
a
swine
maskew
he
said
indignantly
man
you
feel
you
want
to
do
something
you
must
let
off
steam
in
some
way
and
just
as
well
to
do
it
next
morning
the
dean
sent
a
message
to
edwin
and
maskew
asking
them
to
call
at
his
office
during
the
morning
they
went
together
and
were
received
with
his
usual
urbane
politeness
maskew
you
had
better
sit
down
i
am
very
pleased
to
see
your
names
at
the
top
of
the
list
yes
very
pleased
consulted
dr
moon
and
he
approves
your
appointment
as
prosectors
it
is
an
office
that
you
will
be
very
wise
to
undertake
if
you
have
any
surgical
ambitions
and
i
am
very
pleased
to
offer
it
to
you
perhaps
you
will
let
me
know
thank
you
you
take
it
said
edwin
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
course
i
shall
rather
keen
on
anatomy
it
only
means
putting
one
back
a
year
and
worth
it
a
hundred
times
over
if
one
gets
the
primary
fellowship
be
a
fool
if
you
do
it
we
should
have
a
topping
time
together
no
lectures
just
a
year
of
research
shall
have
to
think
about
it
said
edwin
it
was
the
financial
side
of
the
question
that
had
to
be
considered
to
add
another
year
to
a
course
that
was
already
expensive
in
pursuit
of
an
elusive
fellowship
of
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
was
it
worth
while
to
begin
with
he
might
easily
fail
the
primary
examination
was
notoriously
fluky
the
results
depending
on
the
individual
caprices
and
preferences
of
examiners
edwin
knew
very
well
that
better
men
than
himself
had
failed
in
it
if
after
draining
his
pockets
for
another
year
he
should
be
ploughed
the
situation
would
be
altogether
too
pathetic
anything
that
affected
his
purse
seemed
to
edwin
in
those
days
a
matter
for
delicacy
and
shame
he
hated
to
receive
money
from
him
it
was
an
acute
embarrassment
to
see
him
write
a
cheque
he
wrote
slowly
with
a
regular
formal
hand
and
all
the
time
edwin
watching
him
would
think
how
many
small
degrading
sales
of
tooth
paste
and
castor
oil
and
pennyworths
of
camphor
had
gone
to
the
making
of
that
tenuous
and
how
easily
and
carelessly
the
painful
accumulations
would
be
spent
he
hated
asking
his
father
for
money
and
for
this
reason
had
compelled
himself
to
refrain
from
asking
for
the
perfectly
reasonable
and
necessary
allowance
that
he
had
been
wanting
to
settle
for
the
last
year
and
so
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
his
father
that
he
had
been
offered
the
prosectorship
and
the
opportunity
of
taking
the
fellowship
if
he
had
done
so
he
was
almost
certain
that
ingleby
would
have
consented
and
his
sacrifice
would
have
thrown
such
a
weight
of
obligation
on
him
that
life
would
not
have
been
worth
living
indeed
if
in
the
end
he
should
have
failed
his
shame
would
have
been
intolerable
these
reflections
on
the
humility
and
penury
of
his
father
always
plunged
edwin
into
a
debauch
of
sentiment
in
which
he
would
return
with
the
zeal
of
a
prodigal
to
the
resolutions
that
he
had
made
at
the
time
of
his
death
they
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
protective
fervour
that
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
for
love
but
was
in
reality
an
excuse
for
its
absence
still
even
if
the
sentiment
harrowed
it
consoled
and
edwin
was
heroically
elated
by
the
performance
of
a
sacrifice
that
he
had
not
been
brave
enough
to
refuse
it
pleased
him
also
to
find
that
was
thankful
for
his
decision
see
it
would
have
been
rotten
for
me
he
said
you
and
maskew
had
both
been
left
behind
when
got
into
the
habit
of
working
with
a
fellow
in
your
first
two
years
a
bit
of
a
break
to
have
to
go
on
by
yourself
of
course
i
should
never
have
the
least
earthly
chance
of
getting
the
fellowship
and
even
if
i
had
i
afford
to
waste
a
year
over
it
damned
glad
coming
on
with
me
the
tribute
was
flattering
edwin
always
rather
pathetically
anxious
for
friendship
was
particularly
pleased
to
have
it
offered
so
frankly
by
a
creature
as
unlike
him
in
every
way
as
there
was
something
stable
and
reliable
about
the
big
simplicity
he
felt
that
he
would
be
as
loath
to
give
offence
to
as
to
his
father
and
though
he
still
felt
some
indefinite
hankerings
after
the
atmosphere
of
culture
that
he
would
have
enjoyed
in
the
society
of
boyce
he
deny
the
fact
that
was
a
sound
and
splendid
fellow
and
a
good
man
to
have
by
his
side
in
an
emergency
together
they
plunged
into
the
new
world
of
hospital
life
ii
two
general
hospitals
supplied
the
clinical
needs
of
the
north
bromwich
medical
school
the
older
from
which
the
school
had
originated
was
a
small
institution
the
with
which
edwin
had
become
acquainted
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
it
stood
in
the
upper
and
healthier
part
of
the
city
in
the
middle
of
the
slums
that
lie
upon
the
fringe
of
the
fashionable
suburb
of
alvaston
a
solid
building
of
early
victorian
red
brick
with
a
stone
portico
facing
upon
a
thoroughfare
of
rather
older
houses
that
had
once
been
reputable
but
had
now
degenerated
into
theatrical
the
hospital
itself
was
small
enough
to
be
homely
and
and
edwin
soon
became
accustomed
to
its
narrow
entrance
hall
and
the
lodge
in
which
porters
who
already
knew
all
that
was
to
be
known
about
the
reception
of
casualties
were
housed
edwin
would
arrive
at
the
hospital
early
in
the
morning
when
no
sign
of
life
was
to
be
seen
in
the
lodgings
sleeping
with
drawn
blinds
upon
the
other
side
of
the
road
at
this
time
of
the
day
the
hospital
porch
smelt
clean
and
antiseptic
for
the
stream
of
stinking
humanity
had
not
yet
begun
to
trickle
through
he
would
hang
his
coat
in
the
narrow
passage
that
served
for
cloakroom
and
lounge
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
before
the
on
which
the
lists
of
operations
for
the
day
were
exhibited
and
exchange
greetings
with
the
night
porter
departing
in
a
state
of
drowsy
or
the
coming
on
duty
with
a
military
swagger
and
his
grey
hair
plastered
down
with
vaseline
from
the
casualty
department
and
cold
water
here
too
the
members
of
the
consulting
staff
would
arrive
in
their
and
great
men
such
as
lloyd
moore
the
outstanding
surgical
genius
of
the
midlands
old
beaton
the
professor
of
surgery
with
his
long
grey
beard
and
hartley
the
ophthalmologist
whose
reputation
was
european
these
giants
would
pass
on
through
the
swinging
doors
to
their
wards
or
consulting
rooms
and
on
the
very
stroke
of
nine
who
was
a
bad
riser
and
always
cut
things
fine
would
plunge
in
carrying
with
him
the
strenuous
atmosphere
of
a
cold
sponge
and
breezy
enthusiasm
then
the
clock
would
strike
nine
and
they
would
pass
on
together
arm
in
arm
into
the
huge
airy
with
innumerable
benches
set
crosswise
like
the
pews
in
a
church
and
at
the
same
moment
the
military
porter
who
had
been
marshalling
the
queue
of
would
release
them
and
a
bewildering
crowd
of
human
wreckage
would
drift
in
behind
them
settling
patiently
into
the
benches
opposite
the
door
of
the
department
from
which
they
were
seeking
relief
the
work
of
edwin
and
lay
in
the
casualty
department
a
small
room
full
of
pleasant
morning
light
on
one
side
of
it
ran
a
long
counter
with
shelves
for
bottles
and
drawers
in
which
plasters
dressings
and
ointments
were
kept
on
the
other
half
a
dozen
chairs
were
ranged
for
the
reception
of
patients
the
medical
staff
consisted
of
four
persons
only
two
professionals
a
young
and
enthusiastic
surgeon
named
mather
who
held
the
post
of
assistant
surgeon
to
and
an
elderly
sister
who
had
been
on
the
job
for
years
and
two
amateurs
in
the
shape
of
edwin
and
all
of
them
were
clothed
in
white
overalls
for
the
work
of
the
casualty
department
was
of
a
dirty
nature
and
these
long
garments
also
served
as
some
protection
from
the
swarming
parasites
that
lived
upon
the
bodies
of
their
patients
edwin
who
suffered
agonies
of
irritation
from
their
attacks
also
armed
himself
with
a
bottle
of
ether
with
which
he
would
drench
the
seat
of
irritation
in
the
hopes
of
inflicting
death
or
at
least
unconsciousness
upon
his
tormentors
then
one
by
one
the
patients
would
file
in
and
plant
themselves
upon
the
wooden
chairs
old
men
whose
skins
were
foul
with
the
ravages
of
eczema
and
dirt
combined
women
exhausted
in
middle
age
by
and
the
accepted
slavery
of
housework
sturdy
mechanics
who
had
been
the
victims
of
some
unavoidable
accident
pale
young
women
made
anxious
for
their
livelihood
by
illness
that
its
conditions
had
caused
and
more
terrible
than
all
the
steady
stream
of
wan
transparent
children
the
idols
of
maternal
care
the
victims
of
maternal
ignorance
in
the
human
wreckage
of
the
casualty
department
there
was
no
great
variety
but
all
of
it
was
new
to
edwin
and
and
they
threw
themselves
into
the
labour
with
enthusiasm
working
so
hard
from
nine
till
one
that
their
backs
ached
and
they
lost
all
sense
of
the
passage
of
time
mather
himself
seemed
to
them
a
prodigy
of
skilfulness
so
swift
in
his
decisions
so
certain
and
adroit
in
the
work
of
his
hands
even
the
sister
whom
edwin
had
originally
regarded
as
a
mere
woman
aroused
their
admiration
by
the
ease
with
which
she
worked
and
her
invincible
good
humour
edwin
found
that
she
could
teach
him
more
than
his
male
superiority
would
ever
have
dreamed
little
by
little
the
astounding
confusion
of
their
work
began
to
seem
more
simple
bandages
that
had
seemed
condemned
to
unsightly
ruckles
or
liable
to
fall
unrolled
upon
the
dirty
floor
began
to
fold
themselves
in
symmetrical
designs
edwin
and
vied
with
one
another
in
the
neatness
of
their
dressings
the
smell
of
the
place
that
had
seemed
at
first
to
fester
beneath
an
unconvincing
veil
of
carbolic
and
iodoform
now
seemed
natural
to
their
nostrils
even
pleasant
in
its
familiarity
edwin
began
to
have
time
to
look
about
him
to
form
individual
attachments
to
the
patients
who
came
there
every
day
to
take
a
particular
interest
in
cases
that
he
regarded
as
his
own
gradually
from
the
mass
of
humanity
personalities
began
to
emerge
and
even
intimacies
that
were
flattering
because
they
implied
a
trust
in
his
own
imperfect
skill
he
did
not
know
the
names
of
his
patients
any
more
than
they
knew
his
to
him
they
were
grouped
under
conventional
generics
daddy
granny
tommy
polly
and
the
like
to
them
he
was
always
but
the
thing
that
made
them
human
and
lovable
to
him
was
the
sense
of
their
dependence
on
him
and
the
preference
for
his
attentions
that
was
sometimes
timidly
expressed
gave
him
a
flush
of
gratification
deeper
than
any
he
had
ever
known
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
it
was
true
when
his
patients
told
him
that
he
dressed
them
more
gently
than
the
other
workers
in
the
casualty
department
such
confidences
almost
convinced
him
that
he
had
found
a
vocation
after
lunch
edwin
and
would
talk
over
their
cases
together
in
the
lounge
of
the
dousita
maskew
who
still
met
them
every
day
at
this
resort
found
their
conversation
boring
and
fell
back
more
and
more
upon
the
charms
of
miss
wheeler
who
did
not
seem
to
have
varied
by
a
single
hairpin
since
the
day
of
their
first
acquaintance
and
from
the
discussion
of
their
individual
cases
would
sometimes
pass
on
to
the
more
general
questions
that
their
work
aroused
worth
living
he
would
say
you
first
take
up
medicine
and
spend
a
couple
of
years
over
learning
the
atomic
weights
of
heavy
metals
or
dissecting
the
stomach
of
an
earthworm
you
begin
to
wonder
what
the
devil
getting
at
by
gad
this
hospital
work
opens
your
eyes
doing
something
practical
more
doing
a
job
that
no
professor
of
classics
or
stinks
could
touch
and
you
see
the
actual
results
of
your
treatment
on
your
god
not
one
of
them
said
maskew
morosely
a
matter
of
fact
no
more
than
when
an
electrical
engineer
finds
a
short
circuit
and
makes
a
new
connection
or
when
a
carpenter
makes
a
job
of
a
rickety
all
you
know
about
it
my
friend
said
our
job
dealing
with
human
life
relieving
physical
sometimes
you
get
thanked
for
it
which
is
damned
pleasant
and
a
responsibility
too
if
you
make
a
slip
the
poor
devil
experimenting
on
is
going
to
suffer
you
may
even
kill
him
and
the
extraordinary
thing
is
that
he
trusts
you
to
edwin
also
that
was
the
most
extraordinary
thing
and
indeed
the
most
pathetic
it
showed
him
that
the
practice
of
medicine
imposed
an
actual
moral
discipline
on
those
who
followed
it
an
obligation
of
the
most
meticulous
honour
and
devotion
but
if
the
discipline
of
practice
demanded
much
it
repaid
a
thousandfold
he
had
his
reward
not
only
in
the
thanks
of
the
scabrous
old
men
whose
varicose
ulcers
or
legs
as
they
called
them
he
dressed
but
in
the
rarer
consciousness
of
actual
achievement
which
came
to
him
more
frequently
as
the
scope
of
his
work
extended
one
case
in
particular
he
always
remembered
principally
because
it
was
the
first
of
the
kind
she
was
a
little
jewish
tailoress
who
laboured
at
piecework
in
some
den
in
the
rookeries
on
the
southern
side
of
the
hospital
she
was
not
beautiful
her
face
had
the
peculiar
ivory
pallor
and
her
whole
body
the
unhealthy
brittleness
of
plants
that
have
sprouted
in
a
cellar
but
her
voice
was
soft
and
her
hands
the
fingertips
of
which
were
made
callous
by
the
plucking
of
threads
and
rough
with
innumerable
needle
pricks
were
beautifully
shaped
a
week
or
so
before
she
had
stabbed
her
left
forefinger
with
an
infected
needle
and
lit
a
focus
of
suppuration
in
the
tendon
sheath
she
had
to
live
poor
thing
and
so
for
a
week
she
had
worked
in
a
state
of
agony
while
the
tissues
grew
tense
and
shiny
with
compression
and
the
pain
would
not
let
her
sleep
at
last
when
she
could
work
no
longer
she
had
come
to
the
casualty
department
nursing
her
poisoned
hand
in
a
bandana
handkerchief
she
had
not
slept
for
four
nights
and
was
very
near
to
tears
edwin
who
saw
that
surgery
was
needed
showed
the
case
to
mather
the
surgeon
stripped
the
sleeve
from
her
thin
transparent
arm
and
showed
him
the
red
lines
by
which
the
poison
was
tracking
up
the
lymphatics
towards
the
glands
of
the
axilla
that
stood
like
blockhouses
in
the
way
of
bacterial
invasion
you
come
before
he
said
with
a
roughness
that
was
not
unkind
how
many
times
was
edwin
to
hear
those
very
words
doctor
there
was
my
be
no
more
work
for
you
my
dear
if
you
went
on
much
longer
said
mather
and
then
to
edwin
better
incise
it
at
once
busy
putting
up
a
fracture
straight
down
in
the
middle
line
be
afraid
of
not
going
to
cut
me
doctor
she
said
till
oh
please
when
had
a
he
was
very
nervous
he
assured
her
that
he
would
give
her
no
pain
but
while
he
left
her
to
fetch
the
scalpel
and
the
dressings
he
heard
a
queer
drumming
noise
and
turned
to
see
that
it
was
made
by
the
heels
of
his
patient
trembling
on
the
floor
he
was
nearly
as
tremulous
himself
promise
you
i
hurt
you
he
said
and
she
returned
him
a
painful
smile
it
was
a
look
he
knew
like
the
eyes
of
a
dog
had
said
he
sprayed
the
finger
with
ethyl
chloride
that
froze
into
a
crust
like
hoarfrost
on
the
fingertip
and
blanched
the
skin
that
was
already
pale
with
the
pressure
inside
it
all
the
time
the
girl
was
making
little
nervous
movements
and
sometimes
her
heels
began
to
drum
again
until
she
tucked
them
under
the
bar
of
her
chair
sorry
doctor
i
help
it
she
said
then
with
his
scalpel
he
made
a
clean
longitudinal
cut
through
the
tense
skin
down
to
the
bone
of
the
phalanx
she
gave
a
start
and
clutched
his
hand
so
that
he
nearly
gave
it
up
got
to
do
it
he
thought
must
do
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
cut
with
a
knife
into
living
flesh
a
strange
but
the
bead
of
matter
that
escaped
showed
him
that
he
had
got
to
the
root
of
the
trouble
and
the
sight
of
it
filled
him
with
a
new
and
curious
exultation
it
was
a
long
business
for
the
neglected
pressure
had
impaired
the
vitality
of
the
bone
and
the
wound
would
not
heal
until
the
dead
spicules
had
been
separated
from
the
living
tissue
edwin
dressed
the
finger
every
morning
the
patient
would
have
been
a
poor
subject
at
the
best
of
times
and
he
knew
that
the
fact
that
she
was
now
out
of
work
probably
meant
that
she
was
starving
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
tell
her
that
she
must
have
plenty
of
nourishing
food
but
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
words
would
have
been
no
more
than
a
mockery
in
the
hospital
wards
he
reflected
she
might
have
been
well
fed
but
the
wards
at
the
were
full
of
more
serious
cases
who
could
not
walk
to
the
hospital
to
receive
their
treatment
on
occasions
of
this
kind
he
wished
that
he
were
a
millionaire
an
extravagant
doctors
are
never
millionaires
he
could
only
ram
iron
into
her
and
dress
her
and
try
to
get
her
well
so
that
she
might
travel
back
around
the
vicious
circle
to
the
conditions
that
had
been
responsible
for
her
illness
it
seemed
to
him
that
people
who
were
not
doctors
could
never
really
know
anything
about
life
in
a
little
while
there
were
others
many
of
them
in
whose
cases
he
knew
that
he
had
been
privileged
to
effect
some
positive
good
notably
an
old
woman
always
dressed
in
black
and
loaded
with
crepe
as
though
she
were
attending
her
own
funeral
who
had
fractured
her
wrist
by
slipping
on
an
icy
pavement
one
evening
when
she
was
fetching
her
supper
beer
an
office
that
she
appeared
far
too
ladylike
ever
to
have
performed
she
had
put
out
her
hand
to
save
herself
and
a
colles
fracture
of
the
ulna
and
radius
had
been
the
result
she
called
edwin
dear
and
the
first
thing
that
he
noticed
about
her
was
the
amazing
cleanliness
of
her
withered
skin
he
remembered
the
fortitude
that
she
had
shown
when
first
he
reduced
the
fracture
how
her
bony
fingers
on
one
of
which
was
a
wedding
ring
worn
very
thin
had
clasped
his
for
some
curious
reason
he
felt
very
tenderly
towards
her
and
when
the
bones
were
set
and
he
had
passed
her
on
to
the
massage
department
he
felt
quite
lost
without
her
early
that
was
another
strange
thing
about
medical
practice
the
way
in
which
people
with
whom
he
was
thrown
into
an
intimate
sympathy
for
a
few
days
passed
completely
and
irrevocably
out
of
his
life
and
edwin
found
their
experience
so
intriguing
that
they
took
turns
to
visit
the
casualty
department
in
the
afternoons
when
the
work
was
light
and
the
absence
of
mather
gave
them
a
free
hand
in
the
performance
of
minor
surgery
at
this
time
of
the
day
the
work
of
the
department
was
more
suggestive
of
its
name
for
the
people
who
came
there
were
nearly
all
the
victims
of
sudden
illness
or
accident
that
needed
diagnosis
and
immediate
treatment
it
pleased
edwin
to
deal
with
these
off
his
own
bat
and
he
spent
the
long
afternoons
that
were
free
from
lectures
in
suturing
wounds
removing
brass
filings
or
specks
of
cinders
from
eyes
extracting
teeth
gaining
confidence
every
day
and
suffering
the
mingled
emotions
of
pain
pity
and
violent
indignation
not
infrequently
the
last
for
he
saw
so
much
suffering
that
might
easily
have
been
prevented
but
for
the
ignorance
or
callousness
of
humanity
these
things
aroused
his
anger
but
he
soon
realised
that
anger
was
the
one
emotion
that
a
doctor
is
most
wise
to
suppress
sometimes
a
woman
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
slums
would
enter
in
a
state
of
terror
carrying
in
her
shawl
a
child
that
was
obviously
dying
from
in
the
name
of
heaven
you
come
up
before
he
would
ask
indignantly
neighbours
said
it
was
only
the
teething
doctor
she
would
reply
edwin
would
try
to
suppress
an
inclination
to
damn
the
neighbours
upside
down
you
could
see
the
child
was
ill
he
would
say
doctor
but
how
could
i
get
away
seven
of
them
bless
their
hearts
and
me
going
with
another
and
the
house
looking
like
a
pigsty
and
the
dinner
to
cook
i
got
no
time
to
spare
for
and
he
knew
that
she
spoke
the
truth
contenting
himself
as
he
filled
in
the
form
for
admission
to
the
ward
with
telling
her
that
the
diet
of
soaked
in
beer
which
she
had
been
giving
it
was
not
ideal
for
a
baby
eight
months
old
the
baby
along
to
ward
fourteen
he
would
say
do
what
they
can
for
it
and
be
met
as
likely
as
not
with
a
volume
of
tigerish
abuse
from
a
woman
who
swore
that
if
her
baby
was
going
to
die
it
going
to
do
so
in
any
bloody
hospital
was
it
my
pretty
last
words
sinking
to
a
maternal
coo
and
being
accompanied
by
a
paroxysm
of
kisses
on
the
lips
that
were
already
blue
for
want
of
breath
and
then
edwin
would
control
his
indignation
and
resort
to
wheedling
and
coaxing
feeling
that
if
the
baby
were
left
to
the
mercies
of
maternal
instinct
he
himself
would
be
little
better
than
a
murderer
indeed
the
responsibilities
of
his
calling
and
its
immense
obligations
impressed
themselves
on
him
more
deeply
every
day
he
saw
that
this
profession
of
medicine
was
not
to
be
taken
lightly
that
his
work
in
it
would
be
useless
almost
impious
if
it
were
not
religiously
performed
even
from
the
earliest
ages
this
had
been
so
one
day
idly
reading
a
back
number
of
the
he
came
upon
a
historical
article
that
contained
a
translation
of
the
hippocratic
oath
which
had
been
administered
to
all
those
who
were
initiated
in
the
mysteries
of
medicine
two
thousand
years
ago
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
might
have
been
written
on
the
day
that
he
read
it
thus
it
ran
swear
by
apollo
the
healer
and
æsculapius
and
hygieia
and
panacea
and
i
call
all
gods
and
goddesses
to
witness
that
i
will
according
to
my
power
and
judgment
make
good
this
oath
and
covenant
that
i
sign
i
will
use
all
ways
of
medical
treatment
that
shall
be
for
the
advantage
of
the
sufferers
according
to
my
power
and
judgment
and
will
protect
them
from
injury
and
injustice
nor
will
i
give
to
any
man
though
i
be
asked
to
give
it
any
deadly
drug
nor
will
i
consent
that
it
should
be
given
but
purely
and
holily
i
will
keep
guard
over
my
life
and
my
art
into
whatever
houses
i
enter
i
will
enter
into
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
sufferers
departing
from
all
wilful
injustice
and
destructiveness
and
all
lustful
works
on
bodies
male
and
female
free
and
slaves
and
whatever
in
practice
i
see
or
hear
or
even
outside
practice
which
it
is
not
right
should
be
told
abroad
i
will
be
silent
counting
as
unsaid
what
was
said
to
me
accomplishing
this
oath
and
not
confounding
it
may
there
be
enjoyment
of
life
and
art
being
in
good
repute
among
all
men
for
ever
and
ever
but
to
me
transgressing
and
perjured
the
fine
reading
edwin
the
only
deity
of
whom
he
was
not
quite
certain
was
panacea
obviously
the
classical
representative
of
mother
siegel
it
seemed
to
him
a
pity
that
the
modern
student
was
not
bound
by
the
formulæ
of
the
physician
of
his
three
months
in
the
casualty
department
passed
away
quickly
and
in
the
spring
of
the
year
he
found
himself
attached
as
dresser
to
that
startling
surgeon
lloyd
moore
the
appointment
as
he
soon
realised
was
a
privilege
for
lloyd
moore
was
the
one
man
of
unquestionable
genius
in
the
north
bromwich
medical
school
at
first
the
experience
was
rather
alarming
for
the
vagaries
of
his
chief
and
not
least
his
genial
vulgarity
seemed
at
first
as
though
they
were
going
to
destroy
the
pretty
edifice
of
ideals
that
edwin
had
constructed
on
the
basis
of
the
hippocratic
oath
and
his
experience
in
the
casualty
department
lloyd
moore
to
begin
with
was
no
respecter
of
persons
ancient
or
modern
his
wit
was
ruthless
and
occasionally
bitter
as
edwin
had
reason
to
know
his
language
particularly
in
moments
of
stress
was
unvarnished
and
foul
even
in
the
presence
of
women
on
the
surface
indeed
he
seemed
a
person
whom
hippocrates
would
have
regarded
as
undignified
and
improper
sometimes
in
the
department
edwin
would
blush
for
his
violence
and
cruelty
but
in
the
end
all
these
things
were
forgotten
in
the
realisation
that
the
little
man
was
a
great
surgical
genius
to
whom
diagnosis
was
a
matter
of
inspired
unerring
instinct
and
practice
a
gift
of
the
gods
nor
were
his
virtues
merely
professional
as
he
was
always
called
was
a
man
of
the
people
one
who
had
fought
his
way
inch
by
inch
into
the
honourable
position
that
he
held
as
the
greatest
of
surgeons
and
the
wealthiest
practitioner
in
the
midlands
the
unpaid
work
of
the
hospital
absorbed
him
even
to
the
neglect
of
private
practice
and
every
doctor
in
the
district
knew
that
he
could
count
on
the
very
best
of
the
great
skill
for
a
nominal
fee
in
any
case
of
emergency
far
more
than
any
consultant
in
the
midlands
he
was
regarded
as
the
general
friend
and
as
a
result
of
this
confidence
all
the
most
interesting
surgical
material
of
the
district
found
its
way
into
his
clinic
in
a
little
time
edwin
became
wholly
subject
to
the
spell
of
this
amazing
personality
until
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
could
ever
have
doubted
the
propriety
of
anything
that
said
or
did
he
wondered
more
and
more
at
the
titanic
energy
for
lloyd
moore
was
a
little
fellow
so
pale
that
he
always
looked
as
if
he
were
fainting
with
exhaustion
his
patients
also
adored
him
and
more
than
once
edwin
was
told
in
the
wards
by
elderly
female
admirers
that
lloyd
moore
was
the
very
image
of
jesus
christ
in
the
days
of
the
casualty
department
main
concern
had
been
with
the
alleviation
of
immediate
pain
the
problem
of
the
wards
was
graver
being
no
less
than
the
balance
of
life
and
death
in
the
achievements
of
scalpel
he
saw
the
highest
attainment
of
which
surgery
was
capable
in
a
hundred
cases
offhand
he
could
say
to
himself
that
but
for
lloyd
skill
the
patient
would
have
died
and
when
he
saw
the
fragile
figure
of
the
surgeon
with
his
pale
face
and
burning
eyes
enter
the
theatre
edwin
would
think
of
him
as
a
man
worn
thin
by
wrestling
with
death
death
in
its
most
cruel
and
invincible
moods
but
in
the
theatre
at
the
time
of
one
of
emergency
operations
there
was
no
time
for
dreaming
or
for
romantic
speculation
an
atmosphere
of
materialism
of
pure
sublimated
action
filled
the
room
as
surely
as
the
sweet
fumes
of
chloroform
and
ether
everything
about
the
place
was
clean
and
bright
and
hard
from
the
of
the
roof
and
the
porcelain
walls
to
the
shining
instruments
that
lay
newly
sterilised
in
trays
on
the
tables
even
the
theatre
sister
in
her
white
overall
gave
an
impression
of
clean
bright
hardness
indeed
in
this
white
temple
of
sterility
everything
was
clean
except
those
parts
of
the
body
that
the
nurses
in
the
wards
had
not
scrubbed
with
and
shaved
and
painted
with
iodine
and
the
language
of
whose
physical
lustrations
had
no
effect
whatever
on
his
vocabulary
even
language
was
at
times
a
relief
for
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
human
thing
that
ever
gained
admission
to
the
theatre
and
the
sister
was
so
inhuman
as
never
to
take
the
least
notice
of
it
not
a
smile
nor
even
the
least
compression
of
the
lips
marked
her
appreciation
or
disapproval
of
the
sallies
physically
she
was
an
extremely
attractive
woman
with
very
beautiful
eyes
that
were
not
without
their
effect
upon
edwin
but
the
influence
of
the
place
robbed
her
of
any
sexual
attributes
so
that
she
became
no
more
than
a
monosyllabic
automaton
intent
devoted
faultlessly
prepared
for
any
of
the
desperate
emergencies
of
surgery
from
the
first
edwin
had
noticed
that
the
more
embarrassing
physical
details
of
the
patients
had
no
disturbing
effect
upon
her
modesty
he
soon
saw
that
if
she
had
permitted
herself
for
one
moment
to
be
a
woman
she
could
not
have
remained
the
wholly
admirable
that
she
was
i
imagine
he
thought
any
man
could
marry
a
from
such
reflections
he
would
be
roused
by
the
laconic
on
one
side
of
the
operating
table
he
would
stand
and
on
the
other
with
the
ready
at
his
elbow
the
surgeon
would
pick
up
a
scalpel
carelessly
as
a
man
picks
up
a
pencil
to
write
and
then
apparently
with
as
little
thought
he
would
make
a
long
clean
incision
through
the
skin
and
superficial
fatty
tissues
of
the
abdomen
putting
his
head
on
one
side
to
look
at
it
like
an
artist
whose
pencil
has
described
a
beautiful
curve
then
sharply
ingleby
what
the
hell
do
you
think
doing
and
edwin
would
press
a
swab
of
gauze
to
the
incision
to
absorb
the
blood
that
escaped
from
the
subcutaneous
veins
layer
by
layer
the
various
planes
of
fascia
muscle
and
peritoneum
would
be
opened
and
neatly
laid
aside
every
one
of
them
slipped
in
its
own
pair
of
artery
forceps
then
from
the
gaping
wound
that
probed
with
his
thin
finger
a
sickening
odour
would
rise
one
that
edwin
never
remembered
apart
from
the
other
sickening
smell
of
ether
i
thought
so
would
say
perforated
damn
and
edwin
knew
that
yet
another
creature
had
been
snatched
out
of
the
jaws
of
death
in
the
hands
of
surgery
seemed
so
simple
his
he
used
fewer
instruments
than
any
surgeon
edwin
ever
a
part
of
him
in
the
same
way
as
a
perfect
rider
is
part
of
his
horse
there
was
never
any
hesitation
in
his
surgery
never
any
room
for
doubt
everything
was
straightforward
and
from
the
first
incision
to
the
last
suture
and
he
was
at
his
best
when
he
threw
into
it
a
touch
of
bravura
rejoicing
in
the
amazing
virtuosity
of
his
own
technique
and
playing
a
little
to
the
gallery
you
are
he
would
say
see
nothing
in
it
nothing
at
all
but
a
working
knowledge
of
anatomy
and
a
dollop
of
all
surgery
why
on
earth
should
they
pay
me
a
hundred
guineas
for
doing
a
simple
thing
like
that
nothing
in
it
is
there
edwin
knew
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
it
genius
and
more
than
genius
a
life
of
devotion
to
one
end
only
infinite
physical
strains
cruel
disappointments
harrowing
mistakes
for
even
had
made
mistakes
in
his
time
and
a
doctor
pays
for
his
mistakes
more
heavily
than
any
other
man
apart
from
the
performance
of
emergency
operations
that
might
take
place
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
the
surgeon
only
occupied
his
theatre
on
three
mornings
in
the
week
and
the
greater
part
of
time
was
devoted
to
the
work
of
the
wards
here
he
performed
his
proper
function
as
dresser
being
under
the
responsible
for
the
of
the
patients
on
whom
had
operated
this
business
kept
his
hands
full
nearly
all
the
acute
surgical
cases
needed
dressing
daily
and
some
more
than
once
a
day
it
was
usual
for
the
dresser
to
leave
the
second
dressing
to
be
done
by
the
on
his
evening
round
or
by
the
sister
of
the
ward
who
would
doubtless
have
performed
it
as
well
as
either
of
them
but
nothing
could
induce
edwin
in
his
newest
enthusiasm
to
drop
a
case
into
which
his
teeth
were
fixed
the
morning
visits
were
ceremonial
the
great
floors
of
the
wards
shone
like
the
faces
of
such
patients
as
were
fit
to
be
scrubbed
with
a
soapy
flannel
the
rows
of
beds
were
set
with
a
mathematical
correctness
the
sheets
turned
down
at
exactly
the
same
level
the
water
in
the
jugs
stood
hot
awaiting
the
hands
his
towel
lay
folded
in
the
mouth
a
probationer
and
stood
waiting
to
do
his
professional
pleasure
morning
sunlight
flickered
over
the
leaves
of
aspidistras
that
flourished
in
pots
on
the
central
tables
and
on
the
trays
of
dressing
instruments
that
were
ready
for
his
hand
at
ten
precisely
edwin
an
older
and
more
experienced
edwin
whose
shaves
were
no
longer
a
luxury
whose
clothes
no
longer
looked
as
if
he
were
in
the
act
of
growing
out
of
them
and
whose
collars
were
adorned
by
the
very
latest
thing
in
ties
would
enter
the
ward
roll
up
his
shirtsleeves
and
be
helped
on
with
a
white
overall
by
the
obedient
main
function
in
life
this
office
seemed
to
sometimes
by
the
sister
herself
the
new
edwin
product
of
six
months
in
hospital
was
no
longer
afraid
of
these
attentions
because
they
happened
to
be
performed
by
women
in
a
mild
way
he
was
even
an
amateur
of
the
physical
points
exhibited
by
the
probationer
and
had
arrived
at
a
touching
intimacy
with
the
sisters
who
found
in
him
a
clean
and
pleasant
mannered
youth
and
on
occasion
hauled
him
out
of
the
difficulties
into
which
his
inexperience
landed
him
thus
attired
he
would
begin
his
progress
of
the
ward
followed
wherever
he
went
by
the
females
who
had
robed
him
the
junior
pushing
before
her
the
wheeled
glass
table
on
which
the
dressings
and
instruments
were
kept
for
the
time
being
he
was
or
imagined
himself
to
be
the
most
important
person
in
the
ward
until
perhaps
the
entered
and
his
attendants
forsook
their
allegiance
and
hastened
to
put
themselves
at
the
service
of
this
superior
person
in
the
duties
of
the
wards
edwin
became
far
more
familiar
with
his
cases
than
in
the
casualty
department
the
work
was
less
hurried
and
the
patients
themselves
were
less
fully
armed
with
the
conventional
social
gestures
by
which
men
and
women
protect
and
hide
themselves
they
lay
in
bed
helpless
dependent
on
the
hospital
staff
for
every
necessity
and
amusement
and
the
stress
of
physical
pain
or
the
catastrophe
of
a
major
operation
had
generally
shaken
from
them
the
little
superficialities
that
they
had
gathered
to
themselves
in
the
course
of
everyday
life
edwin
noticed
that
even
at
their
worst
the
women
were
hardly
ever
too
ill
to
be
a
little
concerned
for
their
personal
appearance
and
as
they
grew
better
the
patients
of
both
sexes
would
make
an
heroic
attempt
to
appear
as
they
wished
themselves
to
seem
rather
than
as
they
were
but
he
realised
none
the
less
that
the
doctor
gets
nearer
to
the
of
human
personality
than
any
other
man
who
ministers
to
humanity
with
him
the
person
into
whose
hands
their
suffering
bodies
were
committed
in
an
almost
pitiful
confidence
they
were
concerned
to
hide
themselves
far
less
than
with
any
other
and
in
this
triumphant
discovery
edwin
flattered
himself
that
he
was
becoming
richly
learned
in
human
nature
he
did
not
realise
how
little
he
had
learned
one
thing
however
that
these
days
taught
him
he
never
lost
in
after
life
an
intense
appreciation
of
the
inherent
patience
and
nobility
of
human
beings
the
precious
ore
that
the
fire
of
suffering
revealed
even
the
worst
of
his
north
bromwich
as
elsewhere
disease
is
an
impartial
enemy
falling
on
the
virtuous
and
abandoned
such
amazing
possibilities
of
good
in
these
hospital
wards
the
fundamental
gregarious
instinct
of
mankind
with
the
unselfishness
and
sympathy
that
go
along
with
it
asserted
itself
the
common
life
of
the
ward
was
happy
extraordinarily
happy
removed
from
the
ordinary
responsibilities
of
and
competition
fed
and
housed
and
tended
without
question
the
patients
lived
together
as
happily
as
a
community
of
african
savages
supported
by
the
female
labour
of
the
nursing
staff
obedient
to
the
unquestioned
authority
of
the
sister
in
charge
and
in
eyes
these
too
were
wonderful
people
at
first
he
had
taken
them
more
or
less
for
granted
but
gradually
he
realised
the
tremendous
sacrifices
that
their
life
implied
the
long
hours
the
unceasing
strain
of
keeping
their
temper
the
clean
efficient
materialism
for
which
they
must
have
sacrificed
so
much
of
the
obvious
beauty
of
life
committing
most
of
them
were
an
abnegation
of
the
privileges
of
marriage
and
motherhood
in
a
cloistral
seclusion
as
complete
as
that
imposed
on
the
useless
devotee
of
some
mystical
religion
he
took
it
for
granted
that
the
life
of
a
nun
was
useless
to
any
one
except
well
this
was
a
religion
worth
some
sacrifice
the
religion
of
humanity
they
themselves
would
only
have
called
it
a
profession
at
first
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
their
interests
were
narrow
and
their
lives
of
necessity
mean
he
had
been
astonished
at
the
small
things
that
gave
them
pleasure
a
bunch
of
primroses
from
a
grateful
patient
a
ride
on
the
top
of
a
bus
a
word
of
commendation
from
one
of
the
consulting
staff
a
or
even
a
compliment
and
above
all
the
passionate
attachments
and
enmities
that
made
up
the
life
of
the
nunnery
in
which
they
lived
but
in
the
end
he
began
to
sympathise
with
them
in
the
humility
of
their
pleasures
to
feel
that
anything
might
be
forgiven
to
creatures
who
had
made
so
great
a
sacrifice
in
a
mild
way
he
idealised
them
and
for
this
reason
they
decided
that
he
was
a
nice
iii
in
the
winter
of
his
third
year
newly
formulated
enthusiasm
for
humanity
in
the
bulk
suffered
something
of
a
check
the
hospital
absorbed
him
so
completely
that
in
those
days
he
saw
very
little
of
the
city
going
to
and
from
his
lectures
and
his
work
in
the
pathological
laboratory
at
the
university
without
taking
any
real
share
in
the
life
of
north
bromwich
or
being
aware
of
the
passions
and
interests
that
swayed
the
heart
coming
down
from
the
hospital
one
evening
in
december
he
suddenly
became
conscious
of
a
constriction
in
the
traffic
which
grew
more
acute
as
it
reached
the
narrows
that
debouch
upon
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
town
hall
and
while
he
was
wondering
what
could
be
the
cause
of
this
a
huge
rumour
of
voices
not
unlike
that
which
proceeds
from
a
midland
football
crowd
when
it
disapproves
of
a
referee
but
deeper
and
more
malignant
reached
his
ears
he
wondered
what
was
the
matter
and
since
it
looked
as
if
the
traffic
were
now
completely
blocked
on
the
main
road
he
cut
down
the
quiet
street
that
faces
the
university
buildings
and
overlooks
the
paved
court
in
which
the
statue
of
sir
joseph
astill
inappropriately
dispenses
water
to
a
big
stone
basin
almost
immediately
he
found
himself
upon
the
fringes
of
an
immense
crowd
over
which
the
waves
of
threatening
sound
that
he
had
heard
at
a
distance
were
moving
like
catspaws
on
a
sullen
sea
the
windows
of
the
itself
blazed
with
light
making
the
outlines
of
the
corinthian
pillars
that
surrounded
it
almost
beautiful
he
edged
his
way
into
the
black
crowd
it
was
composed
for
the
most
part
of
workers
in
iron
and
brass
and
exhaled
an
odour
of
stale
oil
in
a
moment
of
relative
silence
he
asked
the
man
who
stood
in
front
of
him
a
little
mechanic
who
had
not
troubled
to
change
the
oily
dungarees
in
which
he
worked
what
was
the
matter
lloyd
george
the
he
said
and
spat
fiercely
edwin
was
not
sure
where
he
had
heard
the
name
before
he
seemed
to
remember
it
as
that
of
a
welsh
member
of
parliament
who
had
come
into
notoriety
during
the
debates
on
the
south
african
war
he
inquired
what
lloyd
george
was
doing
to
speak
joe
said
the
mechanic
savagely
and
as
a
wave
of
sound
that
had
started
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
came
sweeping
towards
them
he
suddenly
began
to
squeal
hoarsely
like
a
carnivorous
beast
in
a
cage
a
ridiculous
noise
that
seemed
nevertheless
to
express
the
feelings
of
the
multitude
from
scraps
of
conversation
that
he
heard
beneath
the
rumour
edwin
began
to
understand
that
this
beggarly
welshman
who
had
spent
the
last
few
years
in
vilifying
the
workmen
of
north
bromwich
generally
and
their
political
idol
in
particular
had
actually
dared
to
bring
his
dirty
accusations
to
the
political
heart
of
the
city
the
in
which
their
favourite
had
delivered
his
most
important
speeches
that
at
this
very
moment
the
meeting
which
popular
feeling
had
proscribed
was
beginning
behind
the
corinthian
pillars
and
that
the
just
indignation
of
north
bromwich
had
determined
that
he
should
not
escape
with
his
life
it
struck
edwin
that
whatever
else
the
welshman
might
be
he
was
certainly
not
lacking
in
courage
but
for
all
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
prevent
his
own
feelings
in
the
matter
from
being
swamped
and
absorbed
and
swept
away
by
the
vast
angry
consciousness
almost
in
spite
of
himself
his
heart
palpitated
with
vehement
malice
against
the
intruder
he
felt
that
he
would
have
experienced
a
brutal
satisfaction
in
seeing
him
torn
limb
from
limb
a
yell
of
extraordinary
savagery
in
which
he
found
it
difficult
not
to
join
rose
from
the
square
the
meeting
it
seemed
had
begun
edwin
saw
members
of
the
crowd
scattering
in
all
directions
a
cry
of
was
raised
and
he
saw
that
men
women
and
children
were
streaming
towards
an
area
of
slum
that
was
being
dismantled
to
make
room
for
some
monument
of
municipal
grandeur
returning
with
caps
and
hands
and
aprons
full
of
stones
and
broken
brick
soon
the
air
was
full
of
flying
missiles
and
though
the
crash
of
glass
could
not
be
heard
ragged
holes
were
torn
in
the
frosted
glass
of
the
windows
a
body
of
police
tremendous
strapping
fellows
marched
by
followed
by
impotent
jeers
and
hooting
and
planted
themselves
in
front
of
all
the
doors
with
truncheons
drawn
their
presence
seemed
to
enrage
the
crowd
inflaming
that
suppressed
hate
of
the
forces
of
order
that
slumbers
in
most
hearts
the
volleys
of
stones
increased
as
the
supplies
of
ammunition
grew
more
plentiful
a
little
dark
man
with
a
red
tie
monotonously
shouting
the
words
speech
was
caught
up
and
as
it
seemed
to
edwin
trampled
to
death
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
struggling
masses
people
began
to
sing
the
revivalist
hymn
we
gather
at
the
river
it
reached
edwin
in
an
immense
and
gathering
volume
with
words
adapted
for
the
occasion
we
gather
at
the
fountain
the
beautiful
the
beautiful
the
fountain
drown
lloyd
george
in
the
fountain
and
he
come
here
any
the
very
volume
of
sound
was
impressive
and
inspiring
suddenly
the
crowd
was
parted
by
the
arrival
of
a
new
body
it
was
a
phalanx
of
university
students
who
had
dragged
an
immense
beam
of
oak
from
the
debris
of
the
dismantled
slum
and
were
hurling
it
forward
as
a
battering
ram
against
one
of
the
principal
doors
edwin
could
see
amongst
them
the
towering
shoulders
of
and
the
mouth
of
the
elder
wade
the
hero
of
the
hansom
cab
wide
open
and
yelling
it
seemed
as
though
the
savagery
of
the
crowd
had
reached
its
height
they
tore
a
way
through
it
trampling
the
fallen
as
they
went
and
then
the
police
who
had
been
held
in
reserve
charged
at
right
angles
to
them
hitting
out
right
and
left
with
their
loaded
batons
the
less
courageous
part
of
the
crowd
tried
to
scatter
the
wave
of
a
stampede
spread
outwards
till
it
reached
the
edge
on
which
edwin
was
standing
he
was
thrown
violently
from
his
feet
into
the
chest
of
a
stranger
who
shouted
it
was
matthew
boyce
think
better
get
out
of
this
he
said
the
words
seemed
to
pull
edwin
back
into
sanity
together
they
forced
their
way
into
a
street
that
was
empty
but
for
a
stream
of
people
hurrying
to
the
square
with
stones
they
stood
panting
in
the
quiet
what
animals
men
are
said
boyce
suppose
it
was
something
like
this
a
hundred
years
ago
when
they
burned
pretty
rotten
said
edwin
you
feel
you
wanted
to
join
in
it
the
amazing
part
of
it
said
boyce
happening
to
you
in
these
days
we
seem
to
have
lost
sight
of
one
they
walked
down
to
the
station
together
an
extraordinary
thing
it
said
edwin
ordinary
peaceable
men
should
go
mad
like
that
men
said
boyce
a
chapter
vii
the
clerk
i
with
this
chance
encounter
the
friendship
of
edwin
and
matthew
boyce
really
began
and
during
the
fourth
year
that
now
opened
before
him
the
figure
of
who
had
dominated
his
stage
by
sheer
physical
magnitude
gradually
receded
it
was
inevitable
for
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
at
alvaston
with
its
air
of
culture
and
refinement
was
far
more
in
keeping
with
inclinations
than
the
obtuse
if
honest
companionship
of
edwin
felt
some
misgivings
for
his
desertion
but
maskew
who
had
now
brilliantly
taken
his
primary
fellowship
began
his
hospital
career
and
rejoined
his
old
partner
so
seeing
that
the
needs
of
were
provided
for
and
his
responsibilities
of
friendship
at
an
end
edwin
drifted
into
a
happy
intimacy
with
the
son
they
were
both
so
young
as
to
be
convinced
that
they
were
very
old
the
world
was
theirs
for
they
were
full
of
health
and
contentment
and
at
present
so
free
from
complication
that
they
could
enjoy
to
the
full
the
treasures
of
the
past
and
shape
the
future
into
splendid
dreams
in
the
beginning
they
had
found
a
field
of
common
interest
in
great
works
of
literature
but
these
enthusiasms
did
not
carry
them
very
far
for
the
appreciation
of
literary
masterpieces
is
at
its
best
a
solitary
pleasure
that
is
not
increased
by
the
joy
of
sharing
it
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
music
that
their
friendship
found
the
most
intense
of
its
pleasures
musical
development
had
been
slow
the
first
seeds
had
been
planted
in
his
babyhood
when
without
understanding
he
had
listened
to
his
playing
the
chapel
services
at
made
interesting
by
the
exotic
harmonies
of
downton
had
nursed
his
interest
in
the
beauty
of
organised
sound
the
closed
piano
in
his
had
been
the
symbol
of
an
instinct
temporarily
thwarted
and
from
this
he
had
escaped
by
way
of
aunt
late
victorian
ballads
which
had
seemed
to
him
very
beautiful
in
their
kind
luckily
his
library
of
music
had
been
good
if
and
when
he
amused
himself
more
or
less
indiscriminately
by
trying
to
learn
the
piano
at
home
he
had
been
forced
to
do
so
by
way
of
the
sonatas
of
beethoven
schubert
and
mozart
and
the
wohltemperiertes
klavier
of
bach
the
emotional
disturbance
of
his
strange
adventure
with
dorothy
powys
had
thrown
him
into
an
orgy
of
which
produced
such
poor
results
that
he
was
forced
to
turn
to
the
of
the
elizabethans
and
of
shelley
which
he
embroidered
with
musical
settings
that
gave
him
more
satisfaction
these
attempts
at
pleased
him
for
a
time
but
it
was
not
until
he
became
friendly
with
boyce
that
he
began
to
realise
what
music
was
not
only
were
the
boyces
the
possessors
of
a
on
which
his
homely
tinklings
became
magnificently
amplified
but
his
father
the
poet
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
best
of
modern
music
boyce
introduced
edwin
to
the
great
german
from
schubert
and
schumann
to
hugo
wolf
and
laid
the
foundations
of
a
feverish
devotion
to
wagner
whom
the
friends
approached
perforce
by
way
of
tannhäuser
and
lohengrin
the
two
operas
that
the
moody
manners
company
ventured
to
present
to
provincial
audiences
edwin
discovered
that
north
bromwich
a
city
that
takes
its
music
as
a
takes
food
in
the
triennial
debauch
of
a
festival
and
then
goes
to
sleep
again
rather
failed
to
society
for
the
performance
of
orchestral
music
the
concerts
were
held
fortnightly
in
the
the
windows
of
which
had
now
been
repaired
and
to
these
concerts
edwin
and
his
friend
went
together
always
sitting
in
the
same
two
seats
under
the
gallery
at
the
back
of
the
hall
in
this
way
they
heard
a
great
deal
of
good
music
the
nine
symphonies
of
beethoven
with
the
leeds
choir
in
the
last
the
usual
orchestral
extracts
from
the
ring
the
meistersingers
overture
and
the
siegfried
idyll
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
symphonies
of
tschaikovski
the
of
strauss
and
a
small
sprinkling
of
modern
french
music
these
were
ambrosial
nights
to
which
they
both
looked
forward
and
martin
who
had
developed
an
unexpected
inclination
for
music
sometimes
went
with
them
the
concerts
became
the
central
incident
in
a
kind
of
ritual
at
seven
the
two
or
sometimes
three
would
meet
in
the
grill
room
behind
the
bar
at
and
consume
a
gross
but
splendid
repast
of
tripe
and
onions
together
with
a
pint
or
more
of
bitter
burton
all
the
best
music
they
had
decided
was
german
and
beer
was
the
only
drink
on
which
it
could
be
fully
appreciated
de
preference
for
laudanum
notwithstanding
pleasantly
elated
they
would
cross
the
road
to
the
and
take
their
familiar
seats
pleased
to
recognise
the
people
who
like
themselves
were
regular
attendants
or
subscribers
to
this
unfashionable
function
and
boyce
who
by
virtue
of
his
distinguished
parentage
knew
every
one
in
north
bromwich
who
was
interested
in
music
would
point
out
to
them
all
the
distinguished
people
who
were
present
oldham
the
critic
of
the
whom
arthur
boyce
declared
to
be
the
soundest
living
writer
on
musical
subjects
and
marsden
who
did
the
musical
criticism
for
the
matthew
knew
them
both
oldham
he
said
was
a
wonderful
fellow
who
wrote
with
a
pen
of
vitriol
that
made
such
short
work
of
baser
metals
that
the
gold
of
beauty
appeared
brighter
for
his
writing
oldham
became
prophet
but
on
the
whole
he
preferred
the
looks
of
marsden
is
marsden
like
he
asked
oh
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
bit
of
a
gas
bag
the
governor
says
that
he
always
reminds
him
of
an
old
hen
you
notice
him
in
talking
nineteen
to
the
dozen
to
that
queer
fellow
with
a
face
like
a
full
moon
who
sits
in
front
of
us
the
fellow
with
the
face
like
a
was
only
one
of
twenty
or
thirty
people
with
whom
the
friends
experienced
a
sort
of
comradeship
on
these
nights
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
time
was
the
end
of
the
concert
when
they
would
walk
out
together
into
the
spring
night
parting
at
the
corner
of
the
and
the
memory
of
great
musical
moments
would
accompany
edwin
home
through
miles
of
darkling
country
and
even
fill
his
little
room
at
halesby
with
their
remembered
glory
or
wander
through
his
dreams
his
life
at
home
was
the
least
satisfactory
part
of
these
enchanted
years
there
were
moments
indeed
when
it
seemed
as
if
the
ideal
relationship
with
his
father
that
had
been
his
early
ambition
were
being
realised
sometimes
on
a
sunday
morning
they
would
walk
round
the
garden
together
in
the
sun
and
edwin
would
experience
a
return
of
the
passionate
and
anxiety
to
please
that
had
overwhelmed
him
in
the
moment
of
their
bereavement
but
their
two
natures
were
radically
so
different
that
such
moments
were
rare
and
when
they
came
were
really
more
of
an
embarrassment
than
a
pleasure
he
felt
that
on
his
side
at
any
rate
the
relationship
was
artificial
that
however
unnatural
it
might
seem
he
really
had
to
whip
himself
up
to
a
proper
appreciation
of
his
virtues
a
sense
of
veiled
but
radical
antagonism
underlay
all
their
dealings
with
each
other
and
at
times
this
hidden
thing
that
edwin
held
in
such
dread
came
so
perilously
near
to
the
surface
as
to
threaten
an
open
rupture
the
question
of
allowance
created
one
of
these
dangerous
situations
edwin
knew
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
live
the
ordinary
life
of
a
medical
student
in
north
bromwich
without
one
but
the
distaste
for
speaking
of
money
matters
which
arose
from
his
delicate
appreciation
of
his
finances
had
made
it
difficult
to
approach
the
subject
at
last
he
had
screwed
up
his
courage
to
the
point
of
making
a
very
modest
demand
and
his
father
instead
of
realising
the
difficulty
he
had
found
in
doing
so
had
hedged
in
a
way
that
made
edwin
feel
himself
a
hard
and
mercenary
parasite
right
father
we
say
anything
more
about
it
he
said
comforting
himself
with
the
assurance
that
in
a
couple
of
years
he
would
be
qualified
and
in
a
position
to
earn
his
own
living
and
pay
his
way
on
the
strength
of
this
and
with
his
eyes
wide
open
he
ran
up
a
number
of
small
bills
in
north
bromwich
and
all
would
have
been
well
if
ingleby
in
a
fit
of
had
not
opened
these
incriminating
documents
and
leapt
to
the
conclusion
that
his
son
was
going
rapidly
to
the
dogs
an
unfortunate
scene
followed
suppose
you
realise
edwin
he
said
you
are
a
minor
and
that
while
you
are
under
age
i
am
responsible
for
these
bills
not
the
least
intention
of
letting
you
pay
them
said
edwin
afraid
i
have
no
alternative
i
want
you
to
tell
me
truthfully
if
there
are
any
course
there
are
others
please
bother
about
them
in
a
little
while
i
shall
be
able
to
pay
is
a
great
blow
to
me
said
ingleby
solemnly
overwhelming
edwin
with
a
picture
of
virtuous
poverty
staggering
from
a
cowardly
blow
in
the
dark
and
the
obvious
distrust
with
which
his
father
regarded
him
made
his
position
at
home
almost
intolerable
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
father
now
looked
upon
all
his
pleasures
with
suspicion
and
as
a
natural
result
he
lived
more
than
ever
to
himself
only
returning
to
halesby
late
at
night
or
at
times
when
he
knew
that
his
father
would
be
busy
in
the
shop
one
circumstance
came
to
bridge
the
gap
between
them
a
course
of
pharmacology
that
edwin
took
early
in
his
fourth
year
he
was
delighted
to
find
a
subject
in
which
his
father
was
more
learned
than
himself
and
spent
a
number
of
hours
that
were
almost
happy
in
the
shop
answering
the
questions
that
ingleby
put
to
him
on
pharmacopoeial
doses
and
searching
the
little
nests
of
drawers
for
rare
drugs
to
identify
in
their
raw
state
but
the
pharmacology
course
was
short
and
the
subject
that
was
so
important
in
his
life
was
small
and
unimportant
in
in
addition
to
which
he
could
not
help
feeling
a
sort
of
ethical
prejudice
against
the
complacency
with
which
his
father
discharged
patent
medicines
that
he
knew
to
be
worthless
if
not
harmful
every
circumstance
tended
to
isolate
him
from
the
influences
of
halesby
his
sudden
attempt
to
be
friendly
with
edward
willis
had
withered
under
the
humiliating
of
his
adventure
with
dorothy
powys
the
new
fields
of
music
that
he
explored
with
matthew
boyce
had
made
him
discontented
with
aunt
ballads
the
general
air
of
elegance
and
refinement
with
which
he
had
become
acquainted
in
one
or
two
alvaston
houses
to
which
the
boyces
had
introduced
him
made
everything
in
halesby
even
his
own
home
seem
a
little
shabby
and
unsatisfactory
north
bromwich
and
his
work
there
claimed
him
more
and
more
ii
even
when
his
first
enthusiasms
and
the
inspiring
generalisations
that
arose
from
them
were
exhausted
he
found
that
he
could
not
escape
from
the
fascination
of
the
studies
which
he
now
pursued
for
the
most
part
in
the
company
of
matthew
boyce
his
third
year
had
not
only
introduced
him
to
the
romance
of
surgery
and
the
human
interests
of
hospital
life
he
had
spent
long
hours
in
the
pathological
laboratory
and
had
made
acquaintance
with
bacteriology
a
science
that
was
still
in
its
infancy
in
this
work
he
had
shared
a
desk
with
boyce
to
whom
it
was
particularly
attractive
and
between
them
they
had
developed
a
bacteriological
technique
rather
above
the
average
taking
an
imaginative
delight
in
the
isolation
of
the
microscopic
deadly
forms
of
vegetable
life
that
are
responsible
for
nearly
all
the
physical
sufferings
of
mankind
when
they
looked
together
at
the
banded
bacilli
of
tubercule
stained
red
with
carbolfuchsin
they
saw
more
than
a
specimen
under
a
coverglass
they
saw
the
chosen
and
bitter
enemies
of
genius
the
malignant
insensate
spores
of
lowest
life
that
had
banished
keats
to
fade
in
rome
shelley
to
drown
by
via
reggio
stevenson
to
perish
in
samoa
the
blind
instruments
of
destruction
that
were
even
then
draining
the
last
strength
from
the
frame
of
the
author
of
hound
of
here
in
a
single
they
could
see
enclosed
enough
of
the
organisms
of
cholera
to
sweep
all
asia
with
a
wave
of
pestilence
here
stained
with
indian
ink
the
dreamy
trypanosome
that
had
wrapped
the
swarming
shores
of
the
nyanzas
of
dark
africa
in
the
sleep
of
death
both
of
them
were
seized
with
a
passionate
fever
for
research
to
rid
humanity
of
this
insidious
and
appalling
blight
now
more
than
ever
they
felt
the
supreme
responsibilities
of
their
calling
and
when
in
their
fourth
year
they
passed
on
to
their
work
in
the
medical
wards
as
clerks
to
the
senior
physician
at
the
infirmary
and
saw
the
effects
of
bacterial
havoc
on
the
bodies
of
men
and
women
their
enthusiasm
rose
to
a
still
higher
pitch
the
canons
of
the
new
university
decreed
that
students
who
had
learnt
their
surgery
at
one
hospital
should
study
medicine
at
the
other
it
was
something
of
a
disappointment
to
edwin
to
exchange
the
homely
atmosphere
of
where
everything
was
familiar
for
the
colder
and
more
formal
wards
of
the
infirmary
this
hospital
which
was
nearly
twice
the
size
of
the
other
was
situated
in
the
lower
and
less
healthy
part
of
the
city
at
there
had
been
a
way
of
escape
westwards
through
the
pleasant
suburban
greens
of
alvaston
to
the
country
and
the
hills
the
infirmary
in
its
arrogance
had
been
set
down
in
the
heart
of
unreclaimed
slums
in
such
a
way
that
its
very
magnificence
and
efficiency
were
depressing
by
contrast
edwin
disliked
the
palatial
splendour
of
its
shining
wards
which
for
all
their
roominess
were
full
of
an
air
that
suffocated
for
the
windows
were
never
opened
and
the
atmosphere
that
the
patients
breathed
had
been
sucked
into
the
place
by
an
immense
system
of
forced
ventilation
filtered
until
it
seemed
to
have
lost
all
its
nature
heated
and
then
propelled
through
innumerable
shafts
into
every
corner
of
the
building
in
the
basement
of
the
hospital
the
machine
that
was
responsible
for
this
circulation
of
heated
air
made
a
melancholy
groaning
and
this
sound
made
the
whole
structure
seem
more
like
an
artificial
assembly
of
matter
than
a
real
hospital
with
a
personality
and
a
soul
it
is
possible
that
the
teaching
methods
of
the
infirmary
were
superior
to
those
of
and
the
supporters
of
the
institution
prided
themselves
on
the
fact
that
the
nursing
staff
was
drawn
from
a
higher
social
stratum
but
for
a
long
time
edwin
felt
considerably
less
at
home
there
than
he
had
been
at
the
older
hospital
the
ward
work
however
was
even
more
fascinating
for
the
reason
no
doubt
that
his
wonder
was
now
tempered
with
a
higher
degree
of
erudition
he
found
his
new
chief
an
inspiring
figure
in
the
first
place
the
fact
that
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
culture
made
him
an
effective
contrast
to
that
dynamic
but
plebeian
genius
he
was
a
graduate
of
one
of
the
older
universities
and
though
this
counted
for
little
in
the
mind
of
edwin
who
now
affected
to
despise
the
city
of
his
broken
dream
it
did
lend
an
air
of
distinction
to
sir
arthur
discourses
he
had
a
quiet
voice
an
admirable
manner
with
women
patients
or
nurses
and
beautiful
hands
on
one
of
which
he
wore
a
signet
ring
embellished
with
his
crest
and
a
motto
which
his
presence
merited
toto
teres
atque
the
rotundity
it
may
be
added
was
so
mild
as
to
do
no
more
than
accentuate
the
elegance
of
a
gold
and
platinum
that
he
wore
he
was
a
great
stickler
for
the
traditions
and
dignity
of
his
profession
and
no
word
that
was
not
infallibly
correct
disturbed
the
urbanity
of
his
slow
and
polished
periods
for
this
reason
his
tutorials
in
the
wards
were
models
of
academic
dignity
and
much
frequented
by
students
who
knew
that
he
was
far
too
anxious
for
the
form
of
his
discourse
to
break
its
continuity
by
asking
awkward
questions
he
treated
his
clerks
and
indeed
every
member
of
his
classes
as
if
they
were
gentlemen
nurtured
in
the
same
fine
atmosphere
as
himself
he
inspired
confidence
and
demanded
nothing
in
return
but
correctness
of
behaviour
and
speech
all
these
things
made
it
easy
to
work
for
him
and
the
fact
that
over
and
above
these
social
qualities
he
was
a
particularly
sound
physician
with
a
reputation
that
was
already
more
than
provincial
made
edwin
sensible
of
the
privilege
of
acting
as
his
clerk
his
speciality
was
disease
affecting
the
heart
or
lungs
and
though
his
wards
at
the
infirmary
were
open
to
all
sorts
of
general
medical
cases
these
two
types
of
tragedy
came
most
frequently
under
his
care
and
observation
sir
arthur
exacted
from
his
clerks
the
preparation
of
accurate
and
voluminous
notes
on
all
his
cases
and
edwin
spent
many
hours
in
the
wards
extracting
from
his
patients
the
details
of
family
and
medical
history
and
moulding
them
into
a
balanced
and
intelligible
report
the
emotions
that
the
study
of
the
tubercle
bacillus
had
aroused
in
him
in
the
laboratory
were
reinforced
a
hundred
times
in
the
wards
devoted
to
phthisical
patients
too
far
advanced
in
dissolution
for
sanatorium
treatment
that
were
his
especial
care
they
were
most
of
them
creatures
of
intelligence
and
sensitiveness
above
the
average
of
the
hospital
patient
their
eyes
shone
between
their
long
lashes
with
a
light
that
may
have
been
taken
for
that
of
inspiration
in
those
of
dead
poets
even
in
the
later
stages
of
the
disease
when
their
strength
would
hardly
allow
them
to
drag
up
their
emaciated
limbs
in
their
beds
and
their
bodies
were
wrung
nightly
with
devastating
sweats
or
attacks
of
hæmorrhage
that
left
them
transparent
and
then
they
were
so
ready
to
be
cheerful
and
to
let
their
imagination
blossom
in
vain
hope
that
edwin
found
them
the
most
pitiful
of
all
his
patients
the
seemed
to
him
the
most
pathetic
as
well
as
the
most
merciful
of
illusions
in
this
ward
he
became
acquainted
with
one
patient
in
particular
a
boy
the
son
of
labouring
parents
whom
heredity
and
circumstance
alike
had
marked
down
from
the
day
of
his
birth
to
be
a
victim
of
the
disease
his
mother
and
two
sisters
had
died
of
it
and
all
his
short
life
had
been
spent
in
a
cottage
made
deadly
by
the
infection
at
the
sunless
bottom
of
a
wet
welsh
valley
as
a
child
he
had
been
too
delicate
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
that
he
would
have
breathed
on
the
way
to
the
village
school
he
had
lived
as
far
as
edwin
could
make
out
in
the
single
room
in
which
his
mother
had
lain
dying
and
had
learned
to
read
and
write
at
her
side
then
she
had
died
and
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
he
had
been
sent
out
to
work
on
the
farm
where
his
father
was
employed
an
occupation
that
might
well
have
saved
him
if
the
work
and
the
exposure
had
not
been
too
severe
or
if
he
had
not
returned
at
night
to
the
infected
hovel
as
it
was
in
the
rainy
autumn
weather
of
the
hills
he
had
caught
a
chill
and
sickened
with
pleurisy
and
thus
the
inevitable
had
happened
he
was
only
fifteen
education
had
never
come
his
way
and
he
had
never
read
any
books
but
the
confessions
of
maria
monk
and
the
family
bible
but
whenever
edwin
came
to
go
over
his
chest
and
make
the
necessary
report
of
his
case
sheets
he
noticed
that
the
boy
would
hide
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
been
writing
his
confidence
was
easily
won
and
without
the
least
shame
he
showed
edwin
what
he
had
been
doing
he
had
spent
his
time
in
writing
verses
composed
for
the
most
part
in
the
jingling
measures
of
moody
and
hymns
they
were
sprinkled
with
strange
dialect
words
that
filled
them
with
splashes
of
sombre
colour
most
of
them
were
frankly
ungrammatical
but
there
were
things
in
some
of
them
that
seemed
to
edwin
to
bear
the
same
relation
to
poetry
as
the
mountain
tricklings
of
that
far
hill
country
bore
to
the
full
stream
of
severn
their
banalities
faintly
imitated
from
the
banalities
of
the
hymn
book
were
occasionally
relieved
by
phrases
of
pure
beauty
that
caught
the
breath
with
surprise
do
you
do
this
edwin
asked
and
when
he
had
recovered
from
the
shyness
and
diffidence
into
which
the
question
had
cast
him
the
boy
told
him
that
he
wrote
his
verses
because
he
help
it
because
the
words
became
an
obsession
to
him
and
would
not
let
him
sleep
until
they
were
written
down
the
thin
flame
of
creative
aspiration
showed
itself
in
other
ways
in
the
vivid
delight
in
colours
and
sounds
and
in
the
strange
pictures
having
no
relation
to
nature
that
he
drew
with
coloured
chalks
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
in
this
case
the
exhaustion
of
chronic
disease
had
revealed
the
existence
as
it
sometimes
will
of
a
faint
fire
of
natural
genius
but
for
the
spite
of
heaven
he
thought
john
keats
and
with
the
feelings
of
an
experimenter
in
explosives
who
mixes
strange
reagents
he
lent
his
patient
a
copy
of
the
works
the
boy
fell
on
them
eagerly
he
confessed
that
he
did
not
understand
them
but
he
would
read
them
all
day
mispronouncing
the
words
as
the
classical
student
perhaps
mispronounces
those
of
the
greek
poets
but
extracting
from
their
sonorous
beauty
a
curious
and
vivid
sensual
satisfaction
a
single
line
would
sometimes
throw
him
into
a
kind
of
trance
and
he
would
lean
back
in
his
bed
with
the
book
open
on
his
chest
and
his
slender
clubbed
fingers
clasped
above
it
repeating
to
himself
his
own
version
of
the
words
without
any
conception
of
their
real
meaning
sometimes
a
line
would
fill
him
with
memories
in
the
shady
sadness
of
a
vale
far
sunken
from
the
healthy
breath
of
morn
far
from
the
fiery
moon
and
one
star
is
like
our
home
he
would
say
the
did
not
approve
of
these
experiments
on
principle
he
would
have
disapproved
of
poetry
and
in
this
case
he
considered
the
reading
of
it
unhealthy
as
if
there
were
any
element
of
health
in
this
misfortune
a
few
weeks
later
the
patient
had
an
attack
of
hæmoptysis
and
died
it
was
only
in
such
cases
of
chronic
illness
that
the
question
of
the
intellectual
state
arose
such
speculations
might
mitigate
the
fatigue
of
slow
siege
warfare
that
had
only
one
end
in
view
but
the
acute
medical
wards
and
particularly
those
devoted
to
acute
pneumonia
were
the
scene
of
shorter
and
more
desperate
conflicts
grapplings
with
death
in
which
the
issue
was
doubtful
and
medicine
could
at
least
give
support
and
sometimes
turn
the
tide
these
were
indeed
terrible
battles
in
which
devoted
nursing
counted
for
much
to
edwin
it
was
a
sight
more
than
the
quiet
of
death
to
watch
a
strong
man
stretched
upon
his
back
breathing
terribly
through
the
struggles
of
pneumonia
in
it
he
could
see
the
most
tremendous
expression
of
a
will
to
live
in
the
clenched
hands
in
the
neck
knotted
and
swollen
with
intolerable
strain
in
the
working
of
the
muscles
of
the
face
and
nose
in
their
supreme
thirst
for
air
the
sound
of
this
breathing
would
fill
the
room
that
was
otherwise
so
silent
that
one
could
hear
the
soft
hiss
of
the
oxygen
escaping
from
its
cylinder
the
train
of
students
that
followed
sir
arthur
round
the
wards
would
stand
waiting
in
the
doorway
knowing
that
nothing
was
to
be
seen
and
the
physician
himself
would
step
quietly
to
the
square
of
red
screens
and
exchange
a
whisper
with
the
sister
who
stood
at
the
bedside
her
lips
compressed
as
though
their
muscles
were
contracting
in
sympathy
with
the
other
tortured
muscles
that
she
watched
how
is
he
the
physician
would
ask
think
holding
his
own
no
a
pity
well
persevere
with
the
brandy
and
the
warm
her
tense
lips
scarcely
moved
and
then
chief
so
quietly
that
the
patient
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
being
indeed
no
more
than
a
mass
of
labouring
muscles
bent
on
life
would
feel
the
temporal
pulse
in
front
of
the
ear
with
his
firm
white
finger
so
bad
sister
not
so
then
he
would
sweep
away
with
the
tails
of
his
swinging
did
you
notice
anything
about
the
hands
hands
sir
his
sir
nothing
afraid
i
think
he
was
plucking
the
bedclothes
carphology
do
they
call
it
had
better
look
the
word
up
if
you
are
not
sure
no
it
was
a
finer
movement
he
was
rolling
his
thumbs
over
the
tips
of
his
index
fingers
just
like
a
man
making
pellets
of
bread
at
a
dinner
party
there
are
men
who
do
that
remember
it
a
bad
sign
in
a
case
of
lobar
pneumonia
come
along
gentlemen
the
pneumococcus
is
a
sporting
antagonist
short
and
sweet
as
soon
die
of
pneumonia
as
anything
and
have
a
run
for
my
money
that
case
has
put
up
a
good
that
on
the
face
of
it
the
use
of
the
word
seemed
to
justify
the
accusation
of
gross
materialism
that
is
so
usually
made
against
the
profession
of
medicine
the
patient
who
lay
there
fighting
for
his
life
was
in
the
eyes
a
case
and
not
as
edwin
who
had
taken
notes
of
his
history
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
disease
knew
him
to
be
a
labourer
from
wolverbury
with
a
wife
and
six
children
two
of
whom
had
died
in
infancy
he
was
a
case
a
human
body
the
soulless
body
that
edwin
had
learned
in
detail
through
two
years
of
labour
in
the
dissecting
room
consisting
of
a
heart
a
nervous
system
starved
of
oxygen
and
weakened
by
the
virus
of
pneumonia
and
a
pair
of
clogged
lungs
this
was
the
whole
truth
as
far
as
it
concerned
the
physician
the
calamity
was
a
material
calamity
to
be
fought
with
material
weapons
and
the
state
of
his
soul
or
his
relations
with
his
wife
and
the
rest
of
the
community
in
which
he
lived
only
mattered
in
so
far
as
they
affected
his
body
and
revealed
him
to
have
been
a
and
temperate
man
for
the
rest
he
was
a
case
and
it
were
well
for
the
physician
to
leave
the
to
the
poets
this
was
one
of
the
hard
lessons
of
medicine
these
were
sombre
things
but
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
they
reflected
the
general
tenor
of
hospital
life
the
infirmary
indeed
was
so
vast
as
to
be
microcosmic
and
its
loves
its
jealousies
and
its
ambitions
combined
to
produce
a
broad
effect
of
human
comedy
not
without
tears
but
leavened
by
the
rich
and
often
unprintable
humour
that
flourished
in
the
department
hospital
politics
hospital
scandals
hospital
romances
combined
to
make
life
a
vivid
and
exciting
experience
in
the
toils
of
the
last
spring
found
securely
bound
harrop
too
had
launched
into
a
desperate
affair
with
a
probationer
in
the
wards
whom
the
matron
promptly
transferred
to
the
infectious
block
and
perpetual
quarantine
edwin
and
boyce
escaped
this
epidemic
of
tenderness
that
swept
through
the
fourth
year
like
measles
they
were
far
too
absorbed
in
their
own
interests
and
discoveries
to
worry
their
hearts
about
anything
in
a
cap
and
apron
spring
passed
in
a
swift
vision
of
in
the
alvaston
garden
and
two
weeks
of
musical
debauchery
one
wagnerian
and
the
other
of
gilbert
and
sullivan
most
of
the
time
they
were
working
at
high
pressure
but
a
week
before
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
examination
boyce
proposed
that
they
should
cycle
down
together
to
the
country
house
that
his
father
rented
in
gloucestershire
and
blow
away
the
vapours
of
forced
ventilation
with
cotswold
air
on
the
eve
of
an
examination
it
seemed
a
daring
but
enthralling
plan
edwin
put
the
proposal
before
ingleby
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
object
indeed
it
had
seemed
to
edwin
for
several
months
that
his
father
was
curiously
distrait
and
less
interested
than
usual
in
his
work
this
consent
freed
his
conscience
and
the
two
friends
set
off
together
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
the
spirit
of
abandoned
holiday
that
is
the
highest
privilege
of
youth
they
had
decided
to
take
no
medical
books
with
them
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
the
examination
might
go
hang
for
a
whole
week
they
would
live
with
no
thought
for
the
morrow
taking
long
rides
over
the
cotswolds
lunching
at
village
inns
on
bread
and
cheese
returning
at
night
to
feasts
of
beans
and
bacon
and
libations
of
overton
cider
they
started
from
the
infirmary
at
two
and
had
soon
left
the
dust
and
of
north
bromwich
behind
the
smooth
wide
road
that
they
followed
stretched
in
magnificent
undulations
over
the
heights
of
the
midland
plateau
from
which
they
could
see
the
shapes
of
uffdown
and
pen
beacon
fading
into
the
west
under
a
pale
sky
in
front
of
them
southward
the
sky
was
blue
in
for
ripping
weather
boyce
shouted
as
he
rode
ahead
the
weather
really
matter
they
were
in
for
a
great
adventure
from
the
plateau
they
glided
swiftly
to
the
vale
of
redditch
and
when
they
had
left
that
sordid
little
town
behind
they
climbed
the
backbone
of
the
ridgway
where
the
road
follows
the
thin
crest
of
a
line
of
small
hills
and
overlooks
on
either
side
two
dreaming
plains
in
a
blue
haze
of
summer
these
green
dominions
lay
asleep
so
richly
scattered
with
dark
woodlands
that
no
human
habitation
could
be
seen
they
were
as
lonely
as
the
sky
westward
of
severn
the
clees
and
malverns
towered
over
wales
but
boyce
appeared
to
be
more
interested
in
certain
lower
wooded
hills
upon
the
eastern
side
he
made
edwin
the
confidant
of
his
latest
romance
and
i
he
said
to
bicycle
out
from
alvaston
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
about
an
hour
and
a
easy
ride
it
was
early
last
summer
those
woods
are
full
of
nightingales
we
used
to
sit
on
a
gate
and
listen
to
them
and
ride
home
together
in
the
dark
i
can
tell
you
it
was
pretty
of
course
it
was
wonderful
everything
must
be
wonderful
in
this
enchanted
country
riding
along
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
edwin
constructed
for
himself
just
such
another
passionate
adventure
and
the
figure
with
which
he
shared
these
imaginary
ecstasies
was
for
want
of
a
better
dorothy
powys
while
the
dream
nightingales
were
singing
their
hardest
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
renewing
that
unforgettable
kiss
they
came
to
a
cottage
half
timbered
and
lost
in
clematis
and
honeysuckle
where
a
steep
road
fell
on
either
side
at
right
angles
to
the
ridge
shouted
boyce
take
the
road
down
through
the
are
the
lenches
said
edwin
riding
abreast
five
of
them
i
think
rous
lench
and
lench
and
lench
and
two
others
a
proper
subject
for
a
collaborate
said
edwin
this
for
a
beginning
i
was
riding
through
the
lenches
i
met
three
strapping
country
and
laughing
together
they
constructed
a
series
of
frankly
indecent
couplets
recording
the
adventures
with
all
three
it
was
a
matter
of
the
most
complete
collaboration
for
the
friends
supplied
alternate
lines
outdoing
one
another
in
rabelaisian
extravagance
edwin
however
provided
the
final
couplet
which
he
declared
gave
the
composition
literary
form
to
my
vicarage
i
hasted
feeling
the
day
had
not
been
parson
of
the
type
of
herrick
said
boyce
but
more
kind
of
affair
is
awfully
serious
at
the
the
gables
of
evesham
and
its
one
tall
tower
swam
in
a
golden
dust
they
drank
cider
in
the
inn
courtyard
purchased
a
couple
of
bath
chaps
at
a
and
crossed
the
avon
through
an
orchard
country
they
rode
in
that
hour
of
evening
when
is
most
wistful
the
sun
went
down
in
a
blaze
of
splendour
behind
bredon
hill
the
perfume
of
a
beanfield
swept
across
the
road
god
it
good
said
boyce
are
nearly
a
village
of
cotswold
stone
half
hidden
in
blossoms
of
crimson
rambler
received
them
the
gardens
were
full
of
pale
phloxes
and
tall
hollyhocks
on
boyce
called
a
pointed
up
the
hill
to
overton
they
dismounted
and
pushed
their
bicycles
up
a
steep
lane
in
the
twilight
bats
were
flitting
everywhere
and
a
owl
fluttered
heavily
between
the
overarching
elms
a
faint
tinkle
of
trickling
water
came
to
their
ears
is
the
sound
of
overton
said
boyce
water
trickling
in
the
they
slept
together
in
the
room
so
soundly
that
the
sun
was
high
before
they
wakened
next
morning
the
week
that
now
followed
was
the
very
crown
of
youth
the
summer
house
stood
upon
a
patch
of
terraced
ground
being
the
highest
of
the
three
farms
round
which
the
hamlet
of
overton
clustered
and
overlooked
the
blossomy
vale
of
evesham
bounded
by
the
cotswold
escarpment
blue
and
dappled
with
the
shadows
of
cloud
read
the
motto
that
father
the
poet
had
placed
above
the
lintel
of
the
door
house
great
indeed
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
there
could
be
no
quieter
place
on
earth
he
and
matthew
would
smoke
their
morning
pipes
together
on
a
stone
terrace
that
bleached
in
the
sun
along
the
edge
of
a
garden
that
the
poet
had
planted
for
perfume
rather
than
for
beauty
of
bloom
here
they
would
sit
nursing
books
that
were
unread
until
the
spirit
tempted
them
to
set
out
towards
the
blue
escarpment
and
after
a
hard
climb
lose
themselves
in
the
trough
of
some
deep
billow
of
cotswold
and
fall
asleep
on
a
bank
of
waving
grasses
or
follow
some
runnel
of
the
leach
or
windrush
until
it
joined
the
mother
stream
where
they
would
strip
and
float
over
the
shallows
with
the
sun
in
their
eyes
emerging
covered
with
the
tiny
water
leeches
that
gave
one
of
the
rivers
its
name
on
the
height
of
cotswold
they
found
an
inn
that
was
half
farm
possessing
a
barrel
of
cider
that
edwin
was
almost
ready
to
acknowledge
as
the
equal
of
that
which
he
had
drunk
in
somerset
and
for
further
attraction
a
huge
yellow
cat
beneath
the
lazy
stare
of
whose
topaz
eyes
matthew
sat
worshipping
in
the
evening
the
air
that
moved
over
the
wolds
grew
cool
and
dry
and
more
reviving
than
any
juice
of
yellow
apples
and
with
their
lungs
full
of
it
they
would
spin
down
the
winding
hills
into
the
plain
past
many
villages
and
golden
reaching
overton
about
sunset
when
the
evening
stocks
that
boyce
had
planted
along
the
approaches
to
his
doorway
recovered
from
their
lank
indolence
and
drenched
the
air
with
a
scent
that
matched
the
songs
of
nightingales
there
pratt
the
wife
of
a
neighbouring
labourer
would
have
their
dinner
ready
tender
young
beans
and
boiled
bacon
and
crisp
lettuce
from
the
garden
that
matthew
dressed
according
to
the
directions
of
his
epicurean
father
and
with
their
meal
and
after
they
would
drink
the
dry
and
bitter
cider
made
at
the
middle
farm
from
the
apples
of
orchards
that
now
dreamed
beneath
them
then
came
music
the
piano
stood
by
the
open
window
and
a
soft
movement
of
air
disturbed
the
flames
of
the
candles
in
silver
candlesticks
that
lighted
the
music
stand
no
other
light
was
there
and
in
the
gloom
beyond
edwin
playing
the
tender
songs
of
grieg
and
schumann
and
the
prelude
to
tristan
would
see
the
long
legs
of
matthew
stretched
dreaming
on
a
sofa
the
nights
were
so
silent
that
it
seemed
a
pity
to
mar
them
with
music
and
for
a
long
time
edwin
would
sit
in
silence
at
the
piano
while
strong
winged
moths
fluttered
in
out
of
the
darkness
and
circled
round
the
flame
last
of
all
before
they
turned
in
they
would
go
for
a
slow
walk
over
meadows
cool
in
the
moonlight
listening
to
the
tingling
silentness
matthew
to
the
gentle
creaking
of
the
branches
of
elms
now
heavy
with
foliage
that
embosomed
their
small
house
the
last
day
of
their
holiday
was
wet
but
that
made
no
great
difference
to
them
for
a
succession
of
showers
drew
from
the
drenched
garden
a
perfume
more
intense
they
spent
the
day
in
musical
exploration
and
when
the
darkness
came
they
sat
together
talking
far
into
the
night
they
talked
of
north
bromwich
for
the
ponderable
influence
of
the
morrow
had
already
invaded
their
quietude
and
of
their
future
work
a
time
said
edwin
shall
be
shall
you
do
general
practice
i
suppose
the
easiest
way
to
make
a
living
what
most
men
like
the
idea
of
it
said
matthew
sordid
unsatisfactory
work
a
hard
living
in
which
science
stands
no
chance
selling
bottles
of
harmless
of
course
but
people
who
really
need
them
you
have
to
do
it
to
make
a
living
if
you
the
other
people
cut
you
think
as
bad
as
that
there
must
be
something
fundamentally
good
about
medical
practice
you
are
actually
helping
the
people
who
are
genuinely
the
ideal
side
of
it
but
another
i
think
i
shall
risk
it
if
the
governor
let
me
have
enough
money
to
wait
for
consulting
practice
i
shall
have
a
shot
at
one
of
the
services
i
think
the
indian
medical
service
is
the
thing
fairly
good
pay
a
chance
of
seeing
the
world
and
a
good
sporting
edwin
had
never
thought
of
it
sitting
there
in
an
english
dusk
the
idea
appealed
to
him
great
rivers
burning
plains
under
the
icy
rampart
of
himalaya
strange
dark
religions
yes
it
sounded
good
his
imagination
went
a
little
farther
ahead
a
according
to
kipling
or
perhaps
a
more
solitary
cantonment
in
the
plains
where
the
commandant
was
a
major
in
the
indian
army
and
the
wife
of
the
commandant
a
girl
whose
name
had
once
been
dorothy
powys
and
the
major
of
course
would
succumb
to
some
pernicious
tropical
disease
through
which
edwin
would
nurse
him
devotedly
and
when
he
was
dead
and
buried
his
beautiful
wife
would
come
to
only
other
englishman
in
the
station
and
say
never
really
loved
him
i
never
really
loved
any
one
but
altogether
an
extremely
romantic
yes
the
indian
medical
service
would
do
very
the
last
night
was
more
beautiful
in
its
silence
than
any
other
it
had
been
a
wonderful
week
there
would
never
be
another
like
it
the
crown
of
youth
and
as
it
came
to
pass
the
end
of
youth
as
well
iii
it
was
late
that
night
when
edwin
reached
home
after
the
huge
openness
of
the
cotswold
expanses
the
air
of
halesby
lying
deep
in
its
valley
seemed
to
him
confined
and
oppressive
and
to
add
to
this
impression
there
was
a
sense
of
thunder
in
it
after
supper
his
father
went
to
his
writing
desk
and
pulled
out
a
sheaf
of
bluish
translucent
papers
which
he
spread
out
on
the
table
and
began
to
study
intently
edwin
sprawling
tired
and
contented
in
the
corner
watched
him
lazily
have
you
got
there
father
he
said
plans
ingleby
replied
nervously
what
for
surely
you
thinking
of
building
a
new
not
exactly
no
i
am
thinking
of
adding
to
this
that
would
be
an
expensive
job
it
big
enough
for
us
big
enough
at
present
but
it
may
not
be
do
you
mean
edwin
laughed
uneasily
for
he
could
not
understand
this
air
of
mystery
ingleby
rose
from
his
plans
and
cleared
his
throat
the
little
room
immediately
became
full
of
an
atmosphere
of
suppressed
intensity
in
which
the
tick
of
the
clock
could
be
heard
as
if
it
were
consciously
calling
attention
to
the
importance
of
the
moment
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
intended
telling
you
this
evening
but
i
found
it
difficult
to
do
so
because
because
i
could
not
be
quite
sure
how
take
it
it
it
may
come
as
a
shock
to
you
i
am
thinking
of
enlarging
the
house
because
i
am
proposing
to
be
married
good
god
a
feeling
of
inexplicable
passion
choked
edwin
so
that
his
voice
did
not
sound
as
if
it
were
his
own
i
knew
it
would
come
as
a
surprise
to
you
probably
find
it
difficult
to
understand
my
feelings
you
be
god
amazement
could
find
no
other
words
are
the
first
person
i
have
told
edwin
thought
a
good
deal
about
it
about
you
particularly
and
quite
satisfied
myself
that
i
am
not
doing
you
any
injustice
in
another
year
i
suppose
you
will
be
going
out
into
the
world
and
leaving
me
decide
what
you
think
too
he
paused
but
edwin
could
not
speak
listen
tell
you
all
about
it
i
think
you
will
approve
of
my
choice
tell
sake
not
well
as
you
hands
that
held
the
papers
trembled
he
smiled
kindly
but
with
a
sort
of
bewilderment
you
wish
he
repeated
and
edwin
feeling
as
if
he
would
do
something
ridiculous
and
violent
in
the
stress
of
the
curiously
mingled
emotions
that
possessed
him
went
quickly
to
the
door
and
ran
upstairs
to
his
room
where
he
flung
himself
on
his
bed
in
the
dark
in
a
little
while
he
found
himself
ridiculously
sobbing
he
could
not
define
the
passionate
mixture
of
resentment
jealousy
shame
and
even
hatred
that
overwhelmed
him
he
could
not
understand
himself
a
no
doubt
would
have
found
a
name
for
his
state
of
mind
describing
it
as
an
but
edwin
had
never
heard
of
and
only
knew
that
his
mind
was
ruthlessly
torn
by
passions
beyond
the
control
of
reason
he
made
a
valiant
attempt
to
think
rationally
primarily
he
admitted
it
his
business
to
decide
whether
his
father
should
marry
again
or
remain
a
widower
his
father
was
a
free
agent
with
responsibilities
towards
edwin
that
were
rapidly
vanishing
and
would
soon
be
ended
he
even
suggest
that
this
new
marriage
would
be
the
ruin
of
any
vital
comradeship
between
them
for
the
hopes
of
this
ideal
state
that
he
had
once
cherished
had
not
been
realised
during
the
last
few
years
there
was
no
reason
why
his
marriage
should
affect
him
personally
or
even
financially
for
he
had
never
reckoned
on
the
least
paternal
support
when
once
he
should
be
qualified
there
was
not
even
the
least
suggestion
that
his
father
was
physically
unsuitable
for
the
married
state
for
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
live
for
many
years
to
come
there
were
actually
valid
arguments
that
edwin
could
not
dispute
in
favour
of
the
as
loneliness
soon
to
be
increased
and
the
discomfort
that
he
had
suffered
as
an
elderly
widower
at
the
hands
of
a
series
of
inefficient
from
every
point
of
view
the
world
would
be
justified
in
concluding
that
he
was
doing
the
correct
and
obvious
thing
why
then
should
edwin
lie
on
his
bed
in
the
dark
wetting
his
pillow
with
tears
and
sick
with
shame
no
reason
could
assuage
his
suffering
however
calmly
he
tried
to
consider
the
matter
the
thought
of
his
mother
rose
up
in
his
mind
a
vision
of
her
beautiful
and
pathetic
and
indefinitely
wronged
came
to
reinforce
his
indignation
he
lit
a
candle
and
gazed
for
a
long
time
at
her
photograph
the
one
that
he
had
always
kept
in
his
desk
at
and
scarcely
noticed
for
the
last
three
years
and
though
he
knew
that
she
was
dead
and
presumably
beyond
the
reach
of
any
human
passion
the
sight
of
her
features
filled
him
more
than
ever
with
this
unconscionable
resentment
so
devastating
in
its
intensity
the
portrait
took
him
back
to
the
tenderness
that
he
remembered
at
the
time
of
her
death
and
particularly
that
strange
moment
when
he
and
his
father
had
knelt
together
in
the
little
room
across
the
landing
the
smell
of
and
then
he
remembered
another
incident
in
the
gloom
of
that
brown
room
at
the
holloway
on
the
windy
crown
of
mendip
whence
he
had
seen
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
thinking
of
this
he
seemed
to
hear
the
voice
of
a
very
old
woman
who
said
inglebys
are
always
very
tender
in
marriage
seen
many
of
them
that
have
lost
their
wives
and
they
always
marry
how
could
she
have
known
and
then
the
thought
of
a
strange
woman
in
the
house
treading
in
the
places
where
his
steps
had
once
moved
swept
him
off
his
feet
again
could
never
stay
here
he
thought
could
never
stay
i
should
do
something
desperate
and
cruel
and
unreasonable
i
help
myself
i
must
go
a
pity
but
i
must
go
i
stay
here
i
simply
with
this
determination
in
his
mind
but
without
the
least
idea
of
the
way
in
which
it
might
be
realised
he
arrived
at
a
state
of
comparative
serenity
in
which
he
could
contemplate
his
photograph
without
so
much
passionate
resentment
at
the
slur
that
was
being
laid
on
her
memory
now
he
saw
everything
in
terms
of
his
new
resolution
he
saw
pathetically
the
little
bed
in
which
he
had
slept
for
so
many
years
the
shelves
on
which
his
favourite
books
were
ranged
the
piano
and
the
sheaves
of
his
music
that
he
had
managed
to
install
in
his
room
all
the
small
details
that
went
together
to
create
its
atmosphere
of
homeliness
the
devil
shall
i
manage
to
leave
them
he
thought
he
went
to
the
window
and
saw
beyond
the
garden
trees
the
low
line
of
those
familiar
hills
the
landscape
that
he
had
always
delighted
in
as
his
own
and
that
now
was
to
be
his
no
longer
he
sighed
for
to
leave
them
seemed
to
him
impossible
they
were
so
familiar
so
much
a
definite
part
of
his
life
a
curious
impulse
seized
him
to
creep
downstairs
and
out
of
the
house
and
visit
the
grave
in
the
cemetery
where
his
mother
was
laid
but
he
restrained
himself
from
this
debauch
of
sentiment
will
do
no
good
he
thought
all
he
even
wondered
if
he
might
feel
happier
if
he
went
down
to
aunt
house
and
confided
in
her
perhaps
she
would
understand
at
least
she
was
his
sister
and
might
be
conscious
of
the
indignity
but
when
he
had
almost
determined
to
do
this
he
reflected
that
she
and
his
uncle
were
probably
in
bed
and
a
ludicrous
picture
of
her
putting
her
head
out
of
the
window
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
with
her
hair
in
curling
pins
restrained
him
besides
it
would
be
rather
ridiculous
to
fall
back
upon
the
sympathies
of
a
person
whom
he
had
neglected
for
several
years
i
must
go
on
my
own
way
he
thought
a
sort
of
break
in
my
life
just
like
the
big
break
before
got
to
be
faced
and
no
good
worrying
about
he
suddenly
remembered
that
in
twelve
time
he
would
be
sitting
for
his
fourth
examination
and
that
it
would
be
wise
for
him
to
get
some
sleep
so
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
wondering
how
many
more
times
he
would
undress
in
that
little
room
and
caring
less
than
he
would
have
expected
he
fell
asleep
soon
for
he
was
thoroughly
tired
out
and
slept
so
soundly
that
he
did
not
see
his
father
enter
the
room
a
few
hours
later
he
came
in
softly
in
his
carrying
a
candle
and
stooped
above
sleeping
figure
with
troubled
eyes

next
day
in
a
fever
of
restlessness
edwin
essayed
and
passed
his
fourth
professional
examination
he
had
expected
to
get
a
in
it
but
when
he
found
himself
near
the
bottom
of
the
list
in
the
neighbourhood
of
he
was
not
seriously
disturbed
the
subjects
of
forensic
medicine
and
toxicology
were
unimportant
and
now
that
his
life
had
taken
this
sudden
change
of
direction
it
did
not
much
matter
what
sort
of
a
degree
he
took
his
one
concern
was
to
get
qualified
and
licensed
to
earn
his
living
on
the
bodies
of
his
as
quickly
as
possible
since
his
interview
with
his
father
the
determination
to
leave
halesby
had
not
faltered
although
he
had
not
then
calculated
the
difficulties
that
now
faced
him
to
begin
with
he
had
no
money
beyond
a
few
pounds
that
his
mother
had
placed
to
his
credit
in
the
post
office
savings
bank
in
his
childhood
luckily
his
college
and
hospital
fees
had
been
paid
in
advance
and
he
was
only
concerned
with
the
actual
cost
of
living
and
the
fees
for
the
final
examination
in
some
way
or
other
he
would
have
to
live
for
twelve
months
and
he
smiled
to
himself
to
think
that
he
was
in
very
much
the
same
position
as
his
father
had
occupied
thirty
years
before
on
the
whole
he
thought
his
father
must
have
had
less
cause
for
anxiety
with
two
hundred
pounds
behind
him
and
the
humble
standards
of
a
village
boy
in
place
of
more
elaborate
traditions
of
life
he
felt
that
he
needed
the
advice
of
a
sound
man
with
some
knowledge
of
the
world
in
an
emergency
of
this
kind
matthew
boyce
could
offer
him
very
little
but
sympathy
and
so
he
turned
naturally
to
the
counsels
of
that
battered
warrior
feeling
at
the
same
time
rather
shabby
in
making
use
of
a
friend
whom
he
had
practically
neglected
in
the
last
two
years
providentially
look
at
it
in
that
light
he
had
always
regarded
edwin
from
a
fatherly
standpoint
and
the
mere
fact
that
this
was
a
case
of
rebellion
against
domestic
authority
of
the
kind
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
since
his
childhood
made
him
sympathetic
though
he
as
edwin
saw
to
his
despair
appreciate
the
delicacies
of
the
situation
can
quite
see
why
you
want
to
cut
adrift
he
said
a
feeling
that
any
dependent
gets
if
he
has
any
guts
in
him
but
damned
if
i
see
any
cause
or
just
impediment
why
these
two
persons
enter
into
holy
suppose
just
rotten
sentimentality
still
i
help
it
there
it
is
the
idea
of
seeing
another
woman
in
my
place
i
simply
stick
it
old
chap
quite
prepared
to
believe
you
know
best
the
thing
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
live
on
nothing
in
this
hard
world
you
can
share
my
bed
for
a
week
or
two
if
you
like
sorry
it
be
for
longer
but
marriage
appears
to
be
in
the
air
to
tell
you
the
truth
going
to
get
married
married
good
lord
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
that
for
know
force
of
circumstance
i
suppose
one
of
the
things
that
happens
when
you
least
expect
i
know
her
yes
you
know
her
sister
merrion
in
number
there
came
to
edwin
a
vision
of
a
tall
dark
girl
with
wavy
brown
hair
and
irish
eyes
whom
he
help
remembering
at
the
infirmary
even
know
that
you
were
until
about
three
weeks
ago
i
happened
to
notice
that
she
was
looking
rather
down
in
the
mouth
and
took
her
out
to
tea
and
then
the
poor
girl
broke
down
at
the
dousita
and
told
me
all
about
her
home
affairs
the
devil
and
all
to
see
a
pretty
girl
like
that
crying
been
having
a
thin
time
of
it
at
home
with
her
father
a
pretty
rotten
sort
of
fellow
i
gathered
and
that
seemed
the
only
way
out
of
it
so
going
to
be
married
next
month
a
sort
of
you
good
lord
are
you
in
love
with
her
course
i
am
you
old
ass
i
marry
her
if
i
be
a
bit
of
a
pinch
till
qualified
say
i
hope
be
a
sudden
pang
of
something
like
envy
overwhelmed
edwin
the
picture
of
settled
peace
romantic
love
in
a
cottage
that
was
about
to
share
with
the
undeniably
beautiful
sister
merrion
struck
him
as
an
ideal
state
a
lucky
devil
he
said
it
seemed
unreasonable
that
should
devote
himself
to
the
smaller
problem
of
ways
and
means
on
the
eve
of
such
a
momentous
adventure
it
hardly
seemed
fair
to
bother
him
going
into
rooms
in
alvaston
at
first
he
said
be
less
expensive
than
furnishing
and
we
intend
to
indulge
in
a
family
for
the
present
meanwhile
if
i
were
you
i
should
go
and
talk
to
the
manager
at
he
may
be
able
to
put
you
on
to
something
yes
have
a
shot
at
him
first
and
mention
my
name
a
very
decent
edwin
laughed
to
himself
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
a
curiously
ironical
fate
for
was
the
identical
firm
of
wholesale
druggists
with
whom
his
father
had
been
employed
on
his
first
arrival
at
north
bromwich
history
was
repeating
itself
in
a
way
that
was
proper
to
romance
in
the
afternoon
he
went
down
to
and
asked
for
the
manager
a
vigorous
person
with
shrewd
eyes
that
he
screwed
up
habitually
whenever
he
made
a
point
in
his
conversation
he
called
edwin
a
form
of
address
that
was
flattering
until
edwin
realised
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
habit
with
him
he
said
me
see
i
know
the
you
know
my
father
in
business
at
yes
of
course
your
father
come
along
to
my
room
doctor
and
have
a
in
this
varnished
chamber
decorated
with
a
collection
of
barbarous
surgical
instruments
survivals
of
the
middle
ages
edwin
unbosomed
himself
the
manager
listened
in
silence
screwing
up
his
eyes
from
time
to
time
to
show
that
he
was
taking
in
story
he
said
at
the
end
of
it
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
it
doctor
candidly
you
edwin
was
only
too
anxious
for
another
opinion
i
think
you
know
when
well
off
to
tell
you
the
truth
doctor
i
think
a
damned
fool
straight
see
not
surprised
said
edwin
made
up
my
mind
not
going
to
stay
at
home
i
do
it
all
only
wondering
if
you
can
put
me
in
the
way
of
a
job
of
some
doctor
easier
said
than
done
when
qualified
be
a
different
matter
altogether
i
think
i
can
promise
to
keep
you
in
at
four
or
five
guineas
a
week
as
long
as
you
like
to
take
them
but
i
honestly
say
anything
for
you
at
present
not
like
the
old
days
when
doctors
were
allowed
to
keep
unqualified
through
my
fourth
you
know
i
could
do
yes
i
thought
of
that
well
doctor
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
you
know
what
i
think
of
it
you
in
the
meantime
better
leave
your
address
no
good
writing
to
halesby
i
suppose
edwin
gave
him
the
address
of
diggings
and
went
off
hopelessly
discouraged
to
find
his
friend
however
was
at
present
far
too
engrossed
in
the
charms
of
sister
merrion
to
be
available
so
edwin
went
on
to
the
house
in
alvaston
only
to
find
that
matthew
had
cycled
down
to
overton
again
with
his
father
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
settle
to
any
work
so
he
took
an
afternoon
train
to
halesby
at
a
time
when
he
knew
his
father
would
be
busy
at
the
shop
and
collected
the
few
belongings
that
he
felt
he
must
take
with
him
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
was
inexpressibly
poignant
within
its
walls
he
reflected
dwelt
the
ghost
of
all
his
childhood
and
memories
of
his
mother
that
had
lain
submerged
in
his
consciousness
for
many
years
rose
to
meet
him
wherever
he
went
well
he
would
never
see
the
place
again
this
exile
it
pleased
him
to
think
was
his
final
sacrifice
to
her
memory
that
was
the
best
way
in
which
he
could
express
it
at
the
worst
another
voice
whispered
it
was
an
excess
of
mawkish
sentiment
all
through
the
afternoon
and
particularly
when
he
disinterred
small
pieces
of
the
lumber
that
he
had
collected
in
his
schooldays
this
sense
of
a
ghostly
childhood
haunted
him
it
followed
him
down
the
stairs
into
the
hall
where
the
grandfather
clock
ticked
steadily
as
it
had
ticked
ever
since
he
could
remember
into
the
dead
soon
to
be
made
alive
by
the
tastes
of
another
feminine
personality
on
the
lawn
where
the
limes
were
shedding
their
sticky
bloom
on
the
way
to
the
station
when
he
lugged
his
bag
through
the
gnarled
shadows
of
ancient
garden
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
old
kindly
nodding
bonnet
as
she
smiled
at
him
from
her
place
in
the
window
where
she
sat
hermetically
sealed
in
an
atmosphere
of
victorian
decay
there
were
the
reedy
pools
and
hanging
woods
ghostly
waters
and
woodlands
never
to
be
seen
again
and
there
was
the
platform
of
halesby
station
reeking
of
hot
coal
dust
and
ashes
and
from
the
incoming
train
a
flux
of
shabby
people
including
the
in
tennis
flannels
and
the
mysterious
commercial
traveller
with
the
brown
leather
bag
reading
the
as
he
walked
from
this
through
the
familiar
desert
the
train
carried
him
into
the
bitter
reality
of
north
bromwich
with
something
approaching
the
feelings
of
an
intruder
he
installed
himself
in
diggings
and
made
a
supper
undeniably
pleasant
of
bread
and
cheese
with
a
large
bottle
of
beer
the
latter
which
happened
to
be
xxxx
induced
a
mood
of
tolerant
sleepiness
and
luckily
prepared
him
to
receive
at
midnight
or
thereabouts
the
confidences
of
his
friend
on
the
subject
of
sister
intellectual
charms
know
old
chap
different
from
poetry
by
the
hour
when
in
the
bunk
on
night
duty
her
favourite
a
long
way
above
my
head
and
all
that
but
a
wonderful
thing
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
to
be
married
to
an
intellectual
woman
so
the
words
poured
into
drowsy
ears
he
was
far
too
sleepy
to
smile
and
longfellow
apart
it
did
seem
to
him
a
comfortable
and
even
enviable
thing
to
be
the
adored
centre
of
the
universe
in
the
irish
eyes
of
a
tender
creature
with
wavy
brown
hair
and
a
painful
domestic
tragedy
was
still
moralising
on
his
past
wickedness
and
the
prospect
of
a
blameless
future
when
edwin
fell
asleep
ii
next
morning
he
was
awakened
by
his
friend
boisterous
and
ruddy
from
a
bath
performing
a
strange
ritual
of
prostrations
and
contortions
in
front
of
an
open
window
discreetly
veiled
with
fluttering
edwin
lazily
watched
the
sinuous
play
of
muscles
under
the
shaggy
limbs
of
through
lids
make
a
topping
subject
for
dissection
he
said
answered
from
between
his
legs
awake
you
old
slacker
a
letter
for
you
that
came
up
with
the
tea
cold
by
the
said
edwin
as
skimmed
the
letter
over
to
him
lord
from
it
was
a
note
hastily
scribbled
advising
edwin
to
go
at
once
and
see
at
lower
sparkdale
north
bromwich
between
nine
and
ten
or
six
and
nine
and
signed
by
the
manager
who
screwed
his
eyes
up
hundred
and
lower
sparkdale
edwin
groaned
say
that
sounds
pretty
bad
is
rather
hot
stuff
for
lower
sparkdale
it
queer
place
for
a
practitioner
said
rubbing
himself
down
with
a
pair
of
all
go
in
for
hyphens
it
impresses
the
classes
when
i
go
into
practice
my
son
i
shall
be
known
as
william
if
i
can
afford
the
extra
letters
on
a
a
pretty
awful
slum
it
been
there
time
you
cleared
off
to
the
bathroom
feel
better
when
edwin
spent
the
morning
in
writing
and
four
times
rewriting
a
letter
to
his
father
it
was
a
difficult
job
for
he
felt
that
the
reasons
for
his
departure
could
not
be
explained
in
words
and
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
purely
a
matter
of
temperament
and
that
he
wish
it
to
imply
any
criticism
of
plans
when
he
had
finished
it
he
found
that
it
was
far
too
late
to
visit
the
surgery
of
he
therefore
waited
till
the
evening
and
then
took
a
through
a
succession
of
sordid
streets
past
the
public
abattoirs
and
the
rowton
house
to
the
level
of
lower
sparkdale
the
extreme
end
of
that
street
was
not
as
bad
as
he
had
imagined
it
might
be
for
at
this
point
the
slum
ended
resolving
itself
into
the
edge
of
a
growing
suburb
of
number
was
a
corner
house
secretively
curtained
with
dirty
muslin
on
flat
brass
rods
a
shining
plate
revealed
the
qualifications
such
as
they
were
of
physician
and
surgeon
and
as
the
front
door
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
a
state
of
disuse
edwin
entered
at
another
marked
round
which
a
number
of
women
some
of
them
carrying
babies
were
clustered
inside
the
door
was
a
narrow
that
concentrated
into
an
incredibly
small
number
of
cubic
feet
the
characteristic
odour
of
an
department
every
seat
was
occupied
and
edwin
deciding
to
wait
for
his
turn
stood
listening
to
a
varied
recitation
of
medical
history
that
every
patient
seemed
compelled
by
the
surroundings
to
relate
to
her
neighbour
at
the
moment
when
he
entered
a
very
stout
woman
who
had
been
drinking
had
the
ear
of
the
company
talking
loudly
over
the
shoulder
of
a
pasty
child
whose
neck
was
covered
with
the
that
fleas
make
on
an
insensitive
skin
and
occasionally
in
accessions
of
tenderness
hugging
it
to
her
bosom
i
says
to
the
inspector
yes
inspector
the
nerve
to
call
says
i
you
can
take
your
summonses
to
i
says
i
my
children
i
says
more
love
for
the
little
things
in
my
finger
than
ever
be
in
your
bloody
body
i
says
and
i
caught
up
and
carried
straight
along
to
the
doctor
doctor
knows
me
i
says
and
more
shall
a
look
at
with
own
eyes
my
pretty
the
child
wriggled
as
she
was
clasped
in
another
beery
embrace
a
bell
tingled
inside
we
shall
see
said
the
lady
determinedly
rising
a
stifficate
if
it
costs
me
two
the
room
murmured
low
applause
and
sympathy
and
she
entered
the
surgery
emerging
two
minutes
later
with
the
testimonial
in
her
mouth
did
i
tell
she
said
doctor
says
there
one
not
time
these
inspectors
was
done
away
with
i
only
will
summons
me
she
went
out
hugging
the
child
in
both
arms
and
a
pale
woman
respectably
dressed
who
had
sat
through
her
tirades
in
silence
took
her
place
in
the
consulting
room
keep
her
long
she
came
out
like
the
rest
of
them
after
an
interview
that
lasted
perhaps
two
minutes
carrying
a
bottle
of
medicine
wrapped
up
in
one
of
the
papers
that
are
called
comic
again
the
bell
rang
god
edwin
thought
this
is
general
practice
it
was
evident
that
he
had
entered
a
world
in
which
the
academic
methods
of
diagnosis
and
prescription
with
which
he
had
been
educated
were
not
followed
on
the
surface
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
physician
could
not
have
given
an
eighth
part
of
the
usual
time
or
care
to
the
consideration
of
any
single
case
he
remembered
instances
of
hospital
patients
who
had
affected
to
despise
the
perfunctoriness
of
the
methods
of
the
department
and
had
boasted
that
they
would
receive
better
attention
from
the
hands
of
a
he
hoped
to
goodness
that
none
of
these
unfortunate
people
would
drift
into
the
hands
of
his
own
turn
came
and
relieved
to
be
rid
of
the
stink
of
the
he
entered
the
surgery
harris
was
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
impatience
behind
a
desk
littered
with
papers
he
was
a
little
man
with
grey
untidy
hair
and
a
drooping
moustache
he
held
a
pencil
in
his
hand
as
if
he
were
itching
to
dash
off
another
prescription
and
an
open
drawer
in
the
desk
at
his
right
hand
was
full
of
small
silver
when
he
saw
that
edwin
was
better
dressed
than
the
majority
of
his
patients
his
manner
changed
at
once
sit
down
he
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
edwin
hesitated
for
he
found
it
difficult
to
begin
harris
encouraged
him
with
a
wink
and
a
grip
of
his
left
arm
my
boy
you
be
frightened
of
me
find
the
your
best
friend
had
a
bit
of
bad
luck
eh
well
not
the
first
and
you
be
the
the
wink
was
the
most
disgusting
part
of
this
performance
but
edwin
quickly
recovering
his
sense
of
humour
pulled
out
letter
and
handed
it
to
the
doctor
now
why
you
say
so
at
first
said
harris
scratching
a
bristly
grey
chin
i
did
mention
to
their
manager
that
i
was
in
want
of
some
one
to
do
a
bit
of
rough
dispensing
and
keep
this
place
tidy
you
see
i
live
here
what
we
call
a
and
the
so
pressing
that
really
no
time
to
do
my
own
dispensing
i
suppose
you
hold
the
hall
your
exams
and
that
a
medical
student
i
took
pharmacology
in
my
last
exam
in
my
final
i
have
thought
it
you
look
very
young
final
year
then
his
eyes
brightened
you
done
your
midwifery
yet
i
shall
do
that
later
in
the
a
pity
a
pity
you
could
have
been
very
useful
to
me
in
that
way
keeping
cases
going
you
know
so
that
i
could
be
in
at
the
finish
i
could
do
twice
the
amount
of
midwifery
that
i
do
now
if
i
had
some
one
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
before
the
general
medical
council
did
away
with
unqualified
assistants
i
used
to
keep
three
of
them
paid
me
well
too
now
got
to
do
everything
myself
a
life
but
money
in
it
i
mind
telling
you
well
no
time
to
waste
what
do
you
want
want
a
place
to
live
in
and
my
keep
and
just
enough
money
to
keep
me
going
till
qualified
all
understand
on
my
own
and
just
about
ten
pounds
to
carry
me
over
a
year
i
hope
you
can
give
me
a
suppose
you
could
take
a
hand
with
dressings
and
things
like
that
edwin
saw
that
the
little
man
was
out
for
bargaining
but
as
long
as
he
could
feel
that
something
was
being
settled
he
really
mind
i
can
do
anything
you
like
to
use
me
for
in
your
surgery
hours
i
promise
more
you
see
i
have
to
pass
my
can
learn
a
lot
of
useful
things
about
general
practice
here
said
harris
should
be
extremely
useful
to
you
you
see
been
at
this
game
for
thirty
years
a
great
chance
for
he
took
up
a
handful
of
silver
from
the
open
drawer
and
started
to
jingle
it
here
wasting
edwin
agreed
suppose
i
take
you
on
i
might
be
able
to
give
you
three
better
say
two
pounds
a
month
you
can
feed
up
at
my
place
and
sleep
here
if
you
sleep
here
be
able
to
take
and
telephone
them
up
to
me
a
bedroom
fitted
up
one
of
my
assistants
used
to
sleep
here
how
will
that
suit
you
with
a
feeling
of
intense
relief
edwin
accepted
well
then
no
reason
why
you
begin
at
once
just
to
get
into
the
way
of
he
paused
and
added
as
an
count
that
you
start
from
he
led
edwin
behind
the
green
baize
curtain
at
the
back
of
his
desk
disclosing
a
set
of
shelves
and
a
counter
stained
with
the
rings
of
bottles
and
measuring
glasses
at
the
end
of
the
counter
was
a
sink
into
which
a
tap
with
a
tapered
nozzle
dripped
dismally
one
drawer
held
labels
another
corks
a
third
a
selection
of
and
bottles
at
the
back
of
the
counter
stood
a
row
of
winchester
quarts
of
indefinite
contents
labelled
with
the
roman
numerals
from
one
to
nine
harris
swabbed
the
swimming
counter
with
a
rag
that
was
already
saturated
with
medicines
can
learn
all
you
want
in
five
minutes
he
said
no
time
for
refinements
in
this
sort
of
practice
these
big
bottles
are
all
stock
mixtures
and
whatever
they
teach
you
in
your
universities
i
can
tell
you
that
these
nine
mixtures
will
carry
you
through
life
there
you
are
number
one
white
mixture
number
two
soda
and
rhubarb
number
three
bismuth
you
have
to
go
easy
with
number
three
expensive
number
four
febrifuge
liquor
ammond
acet
and
that
number
five
iron
and
mag
sulph
and
so
number
nine
mercury
and
pot
iod
you
know
what
for
with
a
laugh
use
a
lot
of
that
here
now
one
ounce
of
each
stock
mixture
to
an
bottle
and
a
dose
i
used
to
put
them
up
in
bottles
but
if
you
give
them
eight
ounces
they
think
getting
more
for
the
money
they
realise
getting
eight
doses
instead
of
twelve
and
their
lookout
it
same
proportions
for
children
and
infants
only
you
use
the
four
and
bottles
instead
with
and
teaspoonful
doses
simple
it
but
you
want
to
simplify
if
going
to
make
money
in
these
days
now
is
that
quite
clear
then
when
a
patient
comes
in
i
have
a
look
at
my
experience
you
can
tell
in
a
i
give
you
a
slip
of
paper
behind
the
curtain
like
this
jones
no
means
an
bottle
one
ounce
of
number
five
stock
mixture
one
tablespoonful
three
times
a
day
then
if
i
put
instead
of
it
means
a
tablespoonful
every
four
hours
but
i
only
do
that
when
i
see
they
can
afford
to
get
through
the
bottle
more
quickly
find
powders
in
that
drawer
cheaper
than
phenacetin
and
caffein
and
calomel
for
children
then
as
i
was
saying
while
i
have
a
look
at
the
patient
and
ask
him
one
or
two
questions
you
make
up
the
when
had
a
talk
to
him
you
change
your
mind
about
the
never
change
my
mind
no
time
for
that
said
harris
if
i
did
we
could
change
the
medicine
next
time
but
you
worry
about
the
treatment
my
part
of
the
business
the
little
man
wonder
if
we
got
through
as
many
as
a
hundred
patients
in
a
couple
of
hours
the
two
of
us
together
now
are
you
ready
he
left
edwin
behind
the
curtain
and
rang
his
bell
a
patient
entered
and
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
said
to
her
the
prescription
was
passed
behind
the
curtain
and
edwin
proceeded
to
fill
a
bottle
from
one
of
the
winchester
quarts
this
business
went
on
monotonously
for
another
hour
edwin
dispensed
mechanically
in
a
kind
of
dream
he
never
saw
a
single
patient
but
little
scraps
of
conversation
showed
him
that
most
of
them
were
suffering
from
the
evils
of
poor
housing
and
a
sedentary
life
it
consoled
him
to
think
that
most
of
the
mixtures
that
he
dispensed
were
relatively
harmless
sometimes
by
an
access
of
solicitude
and
deference
in
the
voice
he
could
gather
that
the
patient
was
of
a
higher
social
degree
and
he
smiled
to
find
in
these
cases
that
the
mixture
was
invariably
prescribed
in
doses
all
the
men
it
appeared
were
judged
to
be
in
need
of
white
mixture
or
rhubarb
all
the
women
demanded
iron
and
mag
sulph
all
the
children
were
treated
with
a
treacly
cough
mixture
or
calomel
powders
in
the
space
of
an
hour
he
must
have
dispensed
at
least
forty
bottles
of
medicine
and
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
he
noticed
that
harris
became
even
more
perfunctory
in
his
such
a
word
were
ever
that
signs
of
irritation
began
to
show
themselves
in
his
voice
at
last
the
bell
rang
twice
and
no
patient
appeared
the
lot
said
harris
appearing
from
behind
the
curtain
think
have
a
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
washed
his
hands
in
the
whole
of
the
evening
you
see
what
like
he
said
think
have
a
nip
of
he
produced
a
vitriolic
bottle
from
a
cupboard
and
mixed
some
whisky
with
water
in
a
good
average
day
he
said
pounds
he
shovelled
the
silver
from
the
drawer
into
a
leather
bag
that
weighed
down
his
coat
pocket
takes
a
lot
of
making
at
a
shilling
a
time
well
how
do
you
like
it
think
i
shall
be
able
to

said
edwin
who
was
not
anxious
to
commit
himself
better
come
and
see
your
it
was
a
bare
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
with
iron
bedstead
and
a
dejected
but
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
at
least
it
would
be
quiet
and
free
from
distractions
shall
be
able
to
read
here
he
thought
after
all
only
for
twelve
much
to
look
at
said
harris
apologetically
send
you
down
some
bedding
expect
you
for
breakfast
at
eight
sharp
better
come
along
and
have
some
supper
think
better
go
and
collect
some
of
my
things
been
staying
with
a
friend
in
his
right
as
you
like
said
harris
sharp
morning
then
you
have
to
be
punctual
if
to
make
money
in
this
edwin
said
keeping
the
key
of
the
surgery
when
the
doctor
had
gone
he
went
back
into
the
curtained
dispensary
and
tried
to
introduce
a
little
order
into
the
waste
a
strange
life
he
thought
a
strange
and
degrading
life
if
this
were
general
practice
he
wondered
why
he
had
ever
despised
his
trade
for
surely
there
was
more
dignity
in
selling
than
in
dealing
so
casually
with
the
diseases
of
human
beings
must
talk
it
over
with
old
he
thought
a
sound
but
he
knew
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
he
afford
to
speculate
on
the
ethics
of
the
case
all
that
mattered
to
him
for
the
present
was
the
necessity
of
finding
a
roof
to
shelter
him
and
food
to
keep
him
alive
he
was
a
beggar
and
could
not
choose
and
had
every
reason
to
be
thankful
for
this
or
any
solution
of
his
difficulties
sounds
bad
said
when
edwin
had
expanded
on
the
refinements
of
medicine
in
a
way
lucky
to
have
fallen
on
your
feet
so
quickly
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
deserve
it
an
old
fool
to
have
left
home
you
know
now
some
chance
of
your
appreciating
how
comfortable
you
boyce
was
more
sympathetic
entering
with
great
pains
and
seriousness
into
the
cause
of
spiritual
nausea
the
results
of
it
pleased
him
in
so
far
as
they
meant
that
in
future
edwin
would
be
living
in
north
bromwich
and
promised
a
perpetuation
of
the
delightful
comradeship
that
they
had
enjoyed
in
the
summer
expect
we
shall
see
a
lot
of
you
old
boy
he
said
evenings
you
edwin
laughed
evenings
be
exactly
ambrosial
i
shall
be
earning
my
two
pounds
a
month
filling
bottles
with
rubbish
at
a
shilling
each
i
shall
feel
like
compounding
in
a
felony
the
devil
iii
and
it
was
pretty
bad
no
more
concerts
or
operas
no
at
overton
no
dinners
at
no
possible
diversion
of
any
kind
that
impinged
upon
the
hours
between
six
and
nine
and
yet
edwin
was
happy
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
at
a
price
he
was
realising
what
independence
meant
even
the
break
at
halesby
had
passed
off
without
any
severe
emotional
disturbance
he
had
written
to
his
father
again
telling
him
his
new
address
and
what
he
was
doing
and
his
father
had
replied
in
his
formal
business
hand
not
indeed
with
any
offer
of
help
but
with
an
implied
approval
of
what
he
had
done
enclosing
a
number
of
bills
opened
and
a
couple
of
book
catalogues
there
was
nothing
unfriendly
in
the
letter
no
heroics
of
outraged
paternity
reading
between
the
lines
edwin
felt
that
by
consulting
no
interests
but
his
own
he
had
made
an
awkward
situation
easy
for
his
father
in
that
case
he
reflected
ingleby
might
very
well
have
made
him
an
allowance
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
grim
satisfaction
to
remember
that
he
was
still
a
minor
and
that
even
if
he
were
too
proud
to
use
it
he
still
held
the
weapon
of
his
legal
responsibility
in
reserve
but
the
next
moment
he
was
ashamed
of
this
reflection
when
it
came
to
a
point
the
element
of
pathos
in
his
history
and
person
always
disarmed
him
it
was
enough
that
he
should
be
happy
principally
for
the
reason
that
his
days
were
so
full
and
any
moments
of
relaxation
came
to
him
with
a
more
poignant
pleasure
than
any
he
had
known
before
he
had
very
little
time
for
reading
outside
the
subjects
of
his
final
that
now
overwhelmed
him
with
an
increasing
weight
for
pleasure
he
read
little
but
lyrical
poetry
finding
his
chief
enjoyment
in
the
last
hour
before
he
fell
asleep
in
empty
with
a
copy
of
selections
from
the
greek
anthology
that
he
had
salved
from
one
of
the
bookstalls
in
cobden
street
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
beginning
to
like
charles
he
for
one
moment
alter
his
opinion
of
the
degradation
to
which
the
man
had
subjected
the
nobilities
of
his
calling
his
meanness
and
his
avarice
in
his
dealings
with
the
unfortunate
people
who
came
to
the
shilling
doctor
for
treatment
he
still
abhorred
him
he
knew
him
to
be
a
person
whose
mind
was
a
sink
of
prurience
and
whose
body
and
habits
were
unkempt
and
unclean
but
for
all
this
he
could
not
deny
the
fact
that
in
his
relations
with
his
dispenser
he
displayed
a
curious
vein
of
natural
kindness
and
that
his
ideals
apart
from
his
loathsome
business
were
of
a
touching
simplicity
every
morning
they
met
at
breakfast
the
doctor
believed
in
good
food
as
a
basis
for
work
and
his
housekeeper
a
small
shrewish
woman
of
fifty
was
an
excellent
cook
at
the
breakfast
table
he
would
impart
to
edwin
the
more
salacious
paragraphs
of
the
morning
paper
which
he
always
opened
at
the
page
that
contained
the
records
of
the
he
took
no
notice
of
politics
can
do
what
they
like
as
long
as
they
legislate
about
and
though
edwin
felt
sincerely
that
the
sooner
his
kind
were
legislated
for
the
better
he
was
thankful
that
his
employer
was
not
a
political
bore
or
bigot
after
breakfast
harris
always
smoked
a
clay
pipe
in
his
carpet
slippers
a
present
from
a
patient
who
for
some
unimaginable
reason
had
been
grateful
then
they
would
walk
down
to
lower
sparkdale
together
in
the
fresh
morning
air
and
the
combination
of
gentle
exercise
with
deeper
breathing
would
impel
the
little
man
to
make
edwin
the
confidant
of
his
ambitions
thousand
pounds
he
would
say
all
i
want
twelve
thousand
pounds
five
hundred
a
year
then
i
shall
find
a
quiet
little
place
in
the
country
and
have
a
rest
keep
bees
and
poultry
what
i
shall
do
and
smoke
a
pipe
in
the
garden
in
the
evening
when
the
poor
devil
that
buys
my
practice
is
going
down
to
the
surgery
to
rake
in
the
in
these
moments
he
would
reflect
on
the
beginning
of
his
career
took
a
good
degree
you
know
you
think
it
to
look
at
me
now
would
you
no
i
had
bad
luck
and
a
bad
wife
which
is
the
worst
sort
of
luck
she
lost
me
my
practice
and
so
i
grew
sick
of
medicine
i
be
bothered
with
the
social
side
of
it
money
was
what
i
wanted
money
and
quiet
and
so
i
took
a
dose
of
medicine
fifteen
years
at
a
shilling
a
bottle
with
advice
thrown
in
and
then
a
quiet
life
that
was
all
i
wanted
and
very
nearly
got
it
another
year
or
two
will
make
me
secure
security
what
i
wanted
well
here
we
are
so
the
work
began
and
no
morning
as
far
as
edwin
could
see
was
different
from
any
other
he
was
thankful
when
the
clock
struck
ten
and
harris
ruthlessly
locked
his
surgery
door
then
fortunately
he
was
obliged
to
take
the
next
tram
to
the
hospital
for
if
he
had
lingered
as
he
was
sometimes
forced
to
do
on
sundays
harris
would
have
lit
his
pipe
and
proceeded
to
regale
him
with
anecdotes
of
medical
experiences
that
always
related
to
sex
on
which
he
dwelt
with
a
slow
deliberate
satisfaction
like
a
dog
that
nuzzles
a
piece
of
garbage
the
aspects
of
medical
science
that
related
to
sex
were
the
only
ones
in
which
he
was
really
interested
he
possessed
an
expensive
and
eclectic
library
of
books
on
these
subjects
to
which
he
was
always
adding
others
that
he
bought
from
the
colporteurs
of
medical
pornography
who
are
continually
pestering
the
members
of
his
profession
these
he
would
pore
over
at
night
when
edwin
was
providentially
engaged
in
reading
for
his
final
is
an
extremely
interesting
profession
from
that
point
of
view
he
would
say
and
indeed
the
dispenser
soon
discovered
that
this
aspect
of
the
medical
profession
supplied
harris
with
a
great
number
of
his
patients
in
the
squalid
underways
of
the
city
he
had
established
a
reputation
for
skill
and
discretion
in
the
treatment
of
contagious
disease
and
the
unfortunate
victims
who
came
to
lower
sparkdale
from
more
reputable
suburbs
were
ready
to
pay
through
the
nose
for
his
advice
one
night
hearing
behind
his
curtain
the
overtures
of
one
of
these
cases
that
he
knew
so
well
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
tone
that
was
familiar
in
the
voice
listening
more
closely
he
could
have
sworn
it
was
the
voice
of
griffin
evidently
it
was
a
person
of
some
consequence
for
harris
devoted
as
much
as
five
minutes
to
his
examination
suppose
you
like
a
prescription
better
make
it
up
for
me
said
the
voice
that
resembled
that
of
griffin
harris
breathed
heavily
as
he
always
did
when
writing
a
prescription
and
then
passed
the
slip
of
paper
behind
the
curtain
to
edwin
edwin
looking
at
once
for
the
name
at
the
head
of
the
prescription
was
disappointed
the
patient
had
preferred
to
remain
anonymous
he
dispensed
the
medicine
and
when
harris
had
said
to
the
patient
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
looking
from
behind
the
curtain
to
verify
his
suspicions
he
could
only
see
the
back
of
the
departing
patient
but
the
suspicion
filled
him
with
a
queer
sensation
of
awe
it
showed
him
a
new
aspect
of
medicine
that
had
never
occurred
to
him
in
hospital
life
but
would
no
doubt
be
present
often
enough
in
private
practice
griffin
was
a
person
well
known
to
edwin
and
his
friends
a
person
about
whose
adventures
and
their
consequences
he
would
easily
and
naturally
have
spoken
if
he
had
retailed
the
incident
to
maskew
and
in
the
dousita
it
would
have
been
the
occasion
of
a
little
pity
and
probably
some
irreverent
mirth
but
he
saw
at
once
that
he
could
do
nothing
of
the
sort
he
had
become
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
keeper
of
a
professional
secret
for
the
rest
of
the
world
however
interested
griffin
and
disease
must
not
exist
edwin
felt
the
weight
of
a
new
responsibility
reflecting
that
in
his
future
life
he
would
in
all
probability
become
possessed
of
many
such
secrets
and
that
there
might
be
occasions
on
which
his
sense
of
duty
would
be
divided
between
the
traditional
discretion
of
hippocrates
and
the
instincts
of
humanity
he
invented
a
hypothetical
case
for
his
own
confusion
supposing
he
had
a
sister
to
whom
griffin
was
engaged
supposing
that
they
were
going
to
be
married
in
a
week
after
this
uncomfortable
knowledge
had
come
into
his
possession
endangering
the
whole
of
her
future
happiness
and
perhaps
her
life
what
in
that
case
should
be
his
attitude
towards
the
question
of
professional
secrecy
what
would
he
do
would
he
be
justified
in
telling
her
what
he
knew
hippocrates
said
but
refusal
narrowed
the
field
of
possibilities
to
confronting
griffin
with
his
own
shame
and
threatening
him
with
what
not
with
that
hippocrates
forbade
obviously
with
death
and
that
would
be
balancing
the
relative
heinousness
of
murder
and
perjury
edwin
began
to
laugh
at
himself
and
while
he
did
this
a
curious
reminiscence
came
into
his
mind
the
picture
of
a
small
boy
who
resembled
him
in
very
little
but
had
been
himself
lying
in
the
hedge
side
of
cross
road
on
the
downs
above
reflecting
on
the
same
problem
of
the
justification
of
homicide
and
saying
to
himself
as
he
brooded
on
his
wrongs
can
quite
easily
understand
a
chap
wanting
to
murder
a
and
this
picture
tempting
him
further
he
relapsed
into
a
dream
of
those
strange
remote
days
tinged
with
extremes
of
happiness
and
misery
and
both
of
them
he
thought
no
more
of
griffin
chapter
ix
easy
row
i
for
a
whole
year
edwin
inhabited
the
room
above
the
surgery
in
lower
sparkdale
it
was
a
happy
year
for
into
it
was
crowded
a
great
wealth
of
experience
and
elevating
discovery
to
which
the
mechanical
drudgery
of
dispensing
room
acted
as
ballast
in
his
medical
studies
he
began
to
feel
for
the
first
time
the
fruits
of
his
earlier
labours
to
realise
that
all
medicine
was
little
more
than
an
intelligent
application
to
life
of
the
theoretical
subjects
that
he
had
mastered
without
reasoning
from
the
very
first
day
of
his
experience
in
the
dissecting
room
there
was
nothing
in
all
that
he
had
learnt
that
had
not
its
direct
bearing
on
his
present
practice
and
the
reflection
that
he
possessed
all
this
essential
knowledge
ready
for
use
was
exhilarating
in
itself
again
the
fact
that
he
was
now
standing
on
his
feet
actually
earning
his
own
living
gave
him
a
greater
happiness
than
he
had
ever
known
in
his
days
of
dependence
it
made
him
accept
the
routine
of
lower
sparkdale
as
a
penance
cheering
him
with
the
thought
that
so
much
sacrifice
was
really
necessary
before
he
should
be
master
of
himself
he
was
lonely
but
this
seemed
inevitable
for
no
person
in
his
senses
could
be
expected
to
grind
along
in
a
to
lower
sparkdale
for
the
sake
of
his
company
and
the
final
year
was
too
full
of
strenuous
studies
for
all
of
them
to
allow
of
much
indulgence
in
the
joys
of
friendship
matthew
boyce
made
a
few
heroic
attempts
he
even
spent
several
evenings
in
dispensary
finding
the
shilling
clinical
and
commercial
methods
something
of
a
joke
they
were
no
joke
to
edwin
he
had
recognised
long
ago
that
they
were
no
more
than
solution
of
the
problem
of
living
the
doctor
saw
nothing
unworthy
in
them
he
did
his
best
within
his
limited
knowledge
for
his
patients
he
was
kind
and
even
on
occasion
generous
if
there
were
fault
to
be
found
it
must
be
with
the
state
that
allowed
such
ignorant
men
to
deal
with
precious
human
bodies
and
not
with
him
when
the
first
humour
of
the
experience
was
exhausted
boyce
came
to
the
surgery
no
more
little
by
little
insulation
became
more
complete
and
in
the
end
he
relapsed
into
the
degree
of
loneliness
that
he
had
known
in
his
early
days
at
given
the
opportunity
he
almost
enjoyed
it
there
was
something
remote
and
secret
about
this
little
room
in
the
corner
house
above
the
grinding
trams
and
when
the
surgery
emptied
at
night
and
he
went
upstairs
to
work
he
would
find
himself
suddenly
overwhelmed
with
a
feeling
of
thankfulness
for
the
fact
that
it
was
so
peculiarly
his
that
his
own
books
and
pictures
and
clothes
had
made
it
individual
and
different
from
any
other
room
in
the
whole
of
the
city
and
when
the
town
slept
and
he
sat
on
reading
into
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
the
lonely
chamber
was
like
a
lighthouse
set
in
seas
of
night
and
dreams
of
the
misty
lands
beyond
severn
of
mendip
couched
in
darkness
or
of
the
sleeping
wolds
by
overton
would
beat
at
his
lighted
window
like
seabirds
in
the
night
at
first
the
sacrifices
that
his
poverty
demanded
had
seemed
no
more
than
part
of
a
new
and
exciting
game
it
was
some
months
before
he
realised
that
literally
he
could
not
afford
the
indulgence
of
a
single
pleasure
that
cost
money
if
he
were
to
free
himself
from
the
bondage
of
dispensary
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
save
enough
money
to
pay
his
examination
fees
he
began
to
find
a
new
delight
in
carefully
hoarded
shillings
and
this
practice
threw
him
into
a
curious
sympathy
with
his
employer
each
of
them
on
a
different
scale
was
committed
to
a
present
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
future
freedom
and
this
reflection
reconciled
him
in
some
degree
to
the
inconveniences
that
miserly
ways
inflicted
on
him
it
was
galling
none
the
less
to
find
that
he
could
mot
afford
to
buy
a
single
new
book
to
hire
a
piano
or
to
hear
any
music
except
the
free
recitals
by
which
the
municipal
organist
convinced
the
citizens
of
north
bromwich
that
they
were
getting
something
for
their
money
in
debauches
of
sound
that
reminded
them
how
much
the
organ
had
cost
sometimes
to
joy
he
played
the
fugues
of
the
clavier
and
on
their
wide
streams
he
would
be
carried
from
springs
of
mountain
sweetness
by
weir
and
cataract
to
solemn
tidal
waters
and
lose
himself
at
last
in
seas
of
absolute
music
time
after
time
he
thanked
god
for
bach
and
walked
home
to
his
garret
like
a
man
who
has
gazed
upon
the
splendour
of
a
full
sea
and
carries
its
tumult
in
his
mind
far
inland
through
all
these
experiences
edwin
was
so
possessed
by
the
one
idea
of
holding
on
until
his
final
exam
was
over
that
he
scarcely
missed
the
society
of
his
friends
he
knew
that
his
friendship
with
boyce
was
founded
too
deeply
in
common
experience
ever
to
be
shaken
by
his
own
changed
circumstances
it
might
lapse
but
it
could
never
be
broken
he
always
felt
that
the
future
held
more
for
them
than
the
past
had
ever
given
but
his
other
friends
maskew
and
martin
in
particular
seemed
to
have
been
translated
to
another
place
of
existence
in
the
wards
and
in
the
lecture
theatres
he
would
meet
them
but
elsewhere
they
had
nothing
in
common
with
his
way
of
existence
even
seemed
gradually
to
be
slipping
away
from
unreasonable
state
for
edwin
after
all
was
now
for
the
first
time
sharing
something
of
the
big
early
experience
for
several
months
they
had
scarcely
spoken
and
then
one
day
nearly
ran
into
each
arms
in
sackville
row
and
almost
mechanically
wandered
off
to
the
dousita
together
in
the
shades
of
the
nothing
had
changed
when
they
sank
into
the
cushions
of
their
favourite
corner
miss
wheeler
approached
them
with
an
exact
replica
of
the
smile
with
which
four
years
before
she
had
engaged
the
heart
of
maskew
and
when
she
took
their
order
she
stood
on
one
leg
in
exactly
the
same
position
leaning
with
a
hint
of
tiredness
that
was
not
surprising
in
a
young
woman
who
habitually
breathed
tobacco
smoke
in
place
of
oxygen
with
her
hand
on
the
curtain
at
the
side
of
their
settee
never
see
maskew
now
she
said
with
a
sigh
think
whatever
happened
to
all
you
boys
she
brought
them
coffee
and
who
had
scarcely
spoken
but
whose
knitted
brows
testified
to
the
pressure
of
some
urgent
problem
said
how
do
you
like
it
do
you
mean
on
your
all
right
said
edwin
never
thought
stick
it
confessed
think
you
had
it
in
you
you
see
in
your
case
there
was
never
the
least
necessity
for
was
you
could
have
understood
it
if
had
a
regular
i
should
certainly
have
stayed
at
home
if
the
governor
booted
me
out
you
never
had
anything
of
that
not
exactly
but
the
position
was
the
same
i
had
a
sort
of
of
emotional
i
was
awfully
sensitive
about
my
mother
my
father
and
i
were
all
wrong
really
nothing
in
common
and
turned
out
all
right
the
main
a
quixotic
ass
my
son
no
not
the
word
but
the
same
sort
of
thing
it
was
really
damned
foolish
of
jolly
sound
to
stand
on
your
own
feet
you
know
where
you
are
for
the
first
time
it
was
only
uncomfortable
because
he
was
really
awfully
decent
he
is
now
but
he
the
faintest
glimmering
of
my
point
of
rarely
have
said
gloomily
you
made
such
an
ass
of
yourself
as
i
new
god
as
bad
as
that
chuckled
thought
it
would
come
as
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
why
on
you
see
she
was
awfully
unhappy
at
home
brute
of
a
father
and
we
simply
got
tired
of
waiting
all
you
must
come
and
see
us
she
always
remembered
your
clerking
in
her
ward
living
in
furnished
rooms
in
alvaston
an
amazing
experience
you
know
marriage
quite
different
from
anything
else
of
the
in
view
of
experience
in
these
matters
edwin
was
ready
to
take
this
for
granted
should
think
it
is
a
damned
funny
thing
he
said
they
parted
there
was
something
almost
pathetic
to
edwin
in
hot
handclasp
he
felt
that
was
up
against
something
far
bigger
than
anything
that
had
happened
to
him
before
a
strange
momentous
adventure
yet
one
that
was
thrilling
and
in
a
way
enviable
once
again
he
found
himself
admiring
the
big
desperate
daring
with
a
wife
and
probably
in
a
few
years
children
assuredly
they
were
all
growing
old
ii
in
all
that
summer
edwin
scarcely
saw
a
patch
of
living
green
except
the
leprous
that
sickened
in
the
hospital
square
the
current
of
his
life
flowed
slowly
through
the
culverts
of
grimy
brick
that
led
from
lower
sparkdale
to
the
infirmary
he
became
part
of
the
stream
of
dusty
humanity
that
set
citywards
and
back
again
with
the
regularity
of
a
tide
in
december
he
came
to
the
end
of
his
penance
the
final
examination
was
fixed
for
the
beginning
of
january
and
before
he
could
sit
for
it
he
was
compelled
to
take
a
course
of
practical
midwifery
twenty
cases
in
all
which
compelled
his
residence
for
a
couple
of
weeks
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hospital
the
institution
to
which
this
department
was
attached
matthew
boyce
and
he
had
decided
a
year
before
that
they
would
do
this
work
together
and
though
the
unusual
strain
of
the
fortnight
in
easy
row
would
be
a
doubtful
preliminary
to
the
effort
of
the
final
examination
the
two
friends
had
always
looked
forward
to
the
experience
the
authorities
of
the
hospital
lacking
obstetrical
wards
had
made
this
course
the
opportunity
for
establishing
an
department
that
could
deal
with
ten
cases
a
week
at
the
nominal
charge
of
five
shillings
each
the
students
worked
in
pairs
and
though
they
could
never
be
sure
of
attending
their
cases
together
the
resident
staff
of
the
hospital
and
if
necessary
a
consultant
physician
were
always
available
in
case
of
an
emergency
edwin
and
boyce
were
housed
in
one
of
the
faded
georgian
buildings
that
faced
the
hospital
its
lower
stories
like
those
of
all
its
neighbours
were
devoted
to
theatrical
lodgings
but
a
special
polished
by
the
moist
hands
of
forty
anxious
husbands
every
month
communicated
with
the
upper
room
in
which
the
resident
students
attempted
to
sleep
the
house
was
as
well
known
to
all
the
poorer
people
in
the
neighbouring
warrens
as
were
the
faces
pale
with
sleeplessness
of
the
students
who
issued
from
it
carrying
the
black
bags
that
were
symbolical
of
their
labours
a
source
of
mysterious
speculation
to
the
children
of
the
district
and
of
amusement
to
the
who
inhabited
the
front
rooms
on
a
monday
morning
in
december
the
landlady
received
edwin
and
boyce
and
installed
them
in
a
small
room
at
the
back
of
the
infested
with
portraits
of
smiling
young
ladies
in
tights
inscribed
with
the
most
dashing
signatures
imaginable
to
herself
meadows
was
evidently
very
proud
of
these
decorations
and
called
attention
to
the
most
blatant
pair
of
legs
by
polishing
the
glass
of
their
frame
with
her
apron
hope
you
gentlemen
will
be
comfortable
she
said
that
i
doubt
it
i
have
many
the
statement
was
a
challenge
and
implied
that
if
there
should
be
any
complaints
the
lodgers
might
look
to
themselves
a
nice
fresh
room
she
said
throwing
open
a
french
window
that
disclosed
a
small
patch
of
black
earth
that
had
once
been
covered
with
grass
but
was
now
untenanted
by
any
living
organisms
but
cats
and
groundsel
like
them
to
keep
the
window
open
it
takes
away
the
smell
of
the
disinfectant
not
but
what
clean
i
dare
edwin
and
boyce
would
have
assented
in
any
case
if
it
were
only
to
release
the
composite
smell
that
penetrated
the
room
from
the
adjoining
offices
and
kitchen
where
it
would
be
imagined
simmered
day
and
night
upon
a
a
pianoforte
she
said
hesitating
at
the
dusty
portiere
find
that
professionals
like
a
pianoforte
cheery
in
a
little
while
it
became
apparent
that
the
professionals
liked
a
pianoforte
in
every
one
of
the
thirty
odd
houses
within
earshot
even
if
they
could
not
play
one
from
the
hour
of
midday
when
they
rose
until
six
when
they
betook
themselves
to
their
various
theatres
the
pianos
of
easy
row
were
never
silent
no
good
trying
to
do
any
work
in
this
place
said
edwin
be
any
time
anyway
said
boyce
wait
till
the
fun
they
lunched
together
on
pudding
and
with
a
brand
of
bottled
beer
in
which
meadows
showed
an
admirable
taste
and
in
the
early
afternoon
the
fun
began
from
the
beginning
fate
had
decreed
a
complication
by
deciding
that
hadley
back
of
number
four
court
sixteen
granby
street
and
higgins
over
number
rea
barn
lane
should
conspire
to
increase
the
population
of
north
bromwich
at
the
same
moment
hadley
and
higgins
achieved
a
dead
heat
arriving
on
the
doorstep
together
in
a
dripping
perspiration
with
messages
of
an
equal
urgency
is
rather
rotten
said
boyce
of
these
ladies
will
you
take
have
higgins
said
edwin
suppose
the
all
right
the
bag
was
right
enough
though
it
contained
very
little
that
could
do
any
harm
and
smelt
abominably
of
lysol
higgins
still
out
of
breath
with
beads
of
sweat
sweeping
an
alluvium
of
metal
dust
into
the
furrows
of
his
cheeks
carried
the
bag
for
edwin
for
all
his
exhaustion
higgins
wanted
to
run
and
edwin
walking
with
long
strides
beside
him
was
in
danger
of
losing
his
dignity
by
being
swept
into
the
same
degree
of
panic
the
reflection
that
this
would
betray
his
inexperience
held
him
back
nurse
said
very
urgent
doctor
higgins
panted
yes
you
excite
yourself
be
all
suppose
said
higgins
doubtfully
well
up
in
these
sort
of
cases
doctor
i
expect
seen
a
lot
of
them
edwin
wished
he
had
been
able
to
grow
a
moustache
for
the
occasion
he
said
higgins
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
a
good
thing
a
very
good
thing
you
see
nairvous
doctor
i
lost
my
fairst
over
it
and
i
want
to
lose
this
one
very
young
she
this
her
first
another
bit
of
bad
luck
through
a
maze
of
gritty
streets
they
hurried
reaching
at
last
a
house
beside
a
corner
which
a
cluster
of
women
gossiping
in
their
aprons
on
the
doorstep
proclaimed
as
the
site
of
this
momentous
birth
one
of
them
snatched
the
black
bag
from
higgins
get
away
and
a
pint
of
beer
quiet
like
this
baint
no
place
for
an
this
way
doctor
here
she
is
poor
she
pushed
her
way
up
the
stairs
breathing
heavily
her
bunchy
skirts
filled
the
staircase
which
was
no
wider
than
a
and
very
dark
is
she
cried
triumphantly
as
she
pushed
open
a
matchboard
door
is
the
doctor
now
you
be
long
my
lover
you
you
doctor
she
deposited
the
talismanic
bag
triumphantly
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
then
she
winked
at
edwin
go
and
keep
out
of
the
way
she
said
that
glad
come
doctor
said
the
nurse
she
was
a
little
shrivelled
woman
with
a
nervous
smile
and
her
hair
packed
into
a
black
net
with
a
wide
mesh
that
made
her
whole
bead
sombre
and
forbidding
her
lips
twitched
when
she
smiled
and
edwin
who
had
been
counting
on
the
moral
support
of
her
experience
saw
at
once
that
she
was
even
more
anxious
than
himself
he
was
soon
to
know
that
the
women
who
acted
as
professional
midwives
in
the
north
bromwich
slums
were
usually
widows
left
without
means
who
adopted
this
profession
with
no
other
qualification
than
a
certain
wealth
of
subjective
experience
on
which
they
were
careful
to
insist
the
claim
had
eight
of
them
myself
so
ought
to
know
did
not
atone
for
the
fact
that
they
actually
know
anything
at
all
brown
the
lady
to
whose
mercies
the
trustful
higgins
had
committed
his
second
was
a
timid
specimen
of
the
class
beneath
her
protestations
of
experience
her
soul
quaked
with
terror
and
a
hazy
conviction
that
if
anything
went
wrong
she
the
unregistered
would
probably
be
committed
for
manslaughter
reduced
her
to
a
state
of
dazed
incompetence
in
which
she
heard
without
hearing
none
too
confident
directions
she
went
downstairs
tremulously
to
bring
hot
water
and
edwin
was
left
alone
with
his
patient
be
long
doctor
will
it
she
said
course
not
of
course
not
said
edwin
he
felt
very
much
of
a
fraud
for
he
the
least
idea
how
long
it
would
be
the
whole
picture
was
moving
the
patient
a
girl
of
or
five
her
hair
drawn
back
tightly
from
a
face
that
was
blotched
already
with
tears
but
not
the
humility
of
the
little
bedroom
with
its
hired
furniture
and
certain
humble
attempts
at
ornamentation
pink
ribbon
bows
upon
the
curtains
a
ridiculous
china
ornament
on
the
mantelpiece
and
brass
knobs
at
the
foot
of
the
bedstead
so
polished
that
they
had
already
become
loose
no
doubt
higgins
the
second
had
been
in
respectable
suburban
service
and
these
worthy
efforts
were
the
signs
of
an
attempt
to
introduce
into
rea
barn
lane
the
amenities
of
alvaston
she
lay
quietly
on
the
bed
gazing
at
nothing
while
edwin
unpacked
his
bag
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
became
suddenly
conscious
that
her
body
had
given
a
kind
of
jump
and
that
her
hands
were
desperately
clutching
a
towel
that
brown
had
knotted
to
the
rail
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
then
he
heard
the
joints
of
the
bedstead
creak
all
right
cheer
it
be
long
he
said
brown
emerged
panting
from
the
stairway
with
hot
water
right
my
lover
another
one
less
now
let
the
doctor
have
a
look
at
a
strange
it
was
a
moment
that
might
have
been
difficult
but
edwin
soon
realised
that
the
seriousness
of
the
occasion
the
fact
that
this
young
life
was
veritably
in
his
hands
made
modesty
seem
a
thing
of
no
account
in
the
eyes
of
this
woman
edwin
was
not
a
young
man
but
an
agency
of
relief
from
pain
in
the
body
that
pain
dominated
there
could
be
no
room
for
blushes
edwin
trying
to
summon
all
his
hardly
learned
theory
to
his
aid
in
practice
was
suddenly
impressed
with
the
obligations
that
this
confidence
imposed
on
him
he
remembered
the
terms
of
the
hippocratic
oath
yea
a
goodly
heritage
it
all
right
doctor
said
the
anxious
voice
of
brown
all
the
lord
for
that
you
hear
what
the
doctor
says
my
it
will
be
a
long
time
say
that
doctor
say
that
higgins
wailed
going
to
leave
me
no
good
staying
here
now
he
said
as
gently
as
he
could
really
all
right
only
a
matter
of
you
help
her
a
bit
doctor
of
course
he
a
business
of
that
kind
would
mean
calling
in
the
from
the
he
was
determined
not
to
be
driven
into
a
panic
though
this
would
have
been
easy
enough
when
he
was
convinced
that
the
case
was
taking
a
normal
though
inevitably
lengthy
course
expect
want
me
again
some
time
this
evening
he
said
brown
showed
him
downstairs
it
is
all
right
you
doctor
she
said
all
right
you
know
what
a
first
case
ought
to
said
brown
proudly
had
eight
he
trudged
back
to
easy
row
where
the
pianos
tuned
in
were
already
combining
to
show
their
catholicity
in
musical
taste
boyce
was
drowsing
in
an
with
the
greek
anthology
open
in
his
lap
your
higgins
he
asked
lazily
all
right
a

hadley
through
her
little
troubles
born
before
arrival
a
soft
job
saves
a
lot
of
good
lady
will
haul
us
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
damn
her
said
edwin
a
conventional
mode
of
expression
for
he
in
the
least
feel
like
damning
higgins
in
his
mind
he
still
carried
the
picture
of
her
plain
hair
and
blotched
face
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
that
sudden
shudder
and
the
noise
of
the
bedstead
creaking
the
evening
passed
quietly
they
tried
to
read
but
found
the
feeling
of
suspense
made
that
impossible
no
message
came
from
higgins
and
as
they
were
almost
certain
to
be
called
out
in
the
night
they
went
to
bed
early
while
they
were
undressing
boyce
humming
softly
the
liebestod
from
tristan
the
bell
in
their
bedroom
rang
higgins
said
edwin
better
go
and
he
groped
his
way
downstairs
in
the
front
room
a
party
of
artistes
were
making
a
noisy
supper
before
he
could
reach
the
door
the
bell
rang
again
and
when
he
opened
it
a
big
man
whose
breath
smelt
of
liquor
lurched
into
the
hall
you
the
doctor
to
come
at
once
to
greville
street
the
missus
the
nurse
says
the
nurse
always
said
it
was
urgent
boyce
came
downstairs
grumbling
better
go
about
my
friend
higgins
damn
higgins
said
boyce
it
was
a
clear
and
frosty
night
in
which
all
points
of
light
whether
of
starshine
or
or
of
blue
sparks
crackling
from
the
tramway
cables
shone
brightly
the
greville
street
husband
lurched
along
beside
them
just
sufficiently
awake
to
show
them
the
way
through
a
maze
of
rectangular
byways
to
a
street
that
lay
upon
the
outer
edge
of
the
district
that
the
hospital
covered
the
chill
clarity
of
the
air
dispelled
sleep
it
was
even
pleasant
to
be
walking
there
for
at
this
time
of
the
night
the
town
was
so
empty
that
they
might
almost
have
been
walking
over
a
country
road
it
is
said
the
husband
thickly
boyce
and
edwin
entered
together
the
front
room
of
the
house
was
crowded
with
people
who
should
have
been
in
bed
they
sat
clustered
about
a
table
on
which
stood
a
number
of
bottles
from
one
of
which
the
messenger
had
evidently
extracted
his
peculiar
perfume
in
the
corner
chair
next
to
the
window
an
old
woman
in
a
lace
cap
had
fallen
asleep
opposite
her
a
very
dirty
old
man
toasted
his
shins
in
front
of
the
fire
a
strapping
girl
with
dark
untidy
hair
and
an
almost
aggressive
physical
beauty
was
holding
forth
shrilly
to
a
group
of
three
women
who
had
wandered
in
to
drink
and
gossip
from
a
neighbouring
court
they
are
said
the
husband
sullenly
on
god
two
of
them
is
that
all
said
the
dark
girl
examining
and
as
it
seemed
approving
upstairs
they
found
a
midwife
of
another
but
equally
characteristic
type
a
fat
woman
whose
attention
was
divided
between
the
patient
in
bed
and
the
cheerful
company
in
the
front
room
on
the
surface
she
was
a
little
patronising
an
attitude
that
the
two
inexperience
made
it
difficult
for
them
to
resent
know
what
you
doctors
want
she
said
standing
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
over
her
red
forearms
of
hot
water
what
you
want
got
some
disinfectant
too
often
been
with
the
doctors
now
we
be
she
bustled
downstairs
looking
into
the
front
room
for
a
drink
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
boyce
confident
in
the
completion
of
his
first
case
took
the
lead
in
questioning
the
patient
a
slightly
older
version
of
the
dark
sanguine
girl
they
had
seen
below
her
whole
attitude
towards
the
business
though
less
pathetic
than
that
of
the
unforgotten
higgins
was
equally
moving
it
implied
such
a
cheerful
and
courageous
acceptance
of
life
and
this
most
uncomfortable
of
its
experiences
her
amazing
vitality
pervaded
the
room
it
could
be
seen
in
her
masterful
smile
in
the
grip
of
her
red
fingers
on
the
knotted
towel
in
the
deep
suffusion
of
her
face
a
jolly
woman
built
in
the
mould
of
a
fighter
who
would
neither
take
quarter
nor
give
it
when
boyce
had
examined
her
she
smiled
disclosing
a
fine
set
of
teeth
and
solemnly
winked
doctor
what
about
it
to
said
the
midwife
chuckling
the
way
to
take
it
all
right
you
know
but
it
be
just
yet
god
i
pay
the
five
bob
for
you
to
tell
me
that
look
doctor
my
elder
sister
a
horrible
time
with
her
first
to
it
took
off
be
a
sport
doctor
and
give
us
a
smell
of
chloroform
come
on
now
two
on
devils
all
you
doctors
are
they
perkins
she
smiled
at
the
midwife
and
then
suddenly
her
face
changed
and
she
clutched
at
the
knotted
towel
my
she
said
and
edwin
saw
the
veins
in
her
neck
swell
and
heard
her
clench
her
teeth
the
way
dearie
the
way
said
perkins
gritting
her
own
teeth
in
sympathy
and
smoothing
back
the
hair
from
the
brow
edwin
and
boyce
were
debating
as
to
whether
it
were
worth
while
staying
when
a
messenger
from
the
hospital
arrived
from
below
to
say
that
hadley
patient
of
the
afternoon
was
worse
and
so
edwin
was
left
alone
once
more
in
the
squalor
of
the
room
he
sat
waiting
in
a
chair
that
was
supposed
to
be
easy
listening
to
the
conversation
of
the
woman
and
her
nurse
most
of
it
was
family
history
of
a
scandalous
kind
and
the
manner
of
its
expression
was
extremely
frank
in
the
course
of
his
hospital
work
he
had
never
before
realised
the
extraordinary
contradictions
of
the
code
by
which
the
talk
of
the
is
governed
in
its
mixture
of
delicacies
and
blatancies
it
amazed
him
both
the
women
were
fluent
gossips
and
the
conversation
never
ceased
except
in
those
moments
of
acute
and
sudden
tension
when
the
hands
clutched
at
her
towel
and
the
midwife
mopped
her
brow
then
when
the
upstairs
room
was
silent
a
murmur
of
laughter
and
loud
voices
would
come
up
the
stairs
from
below
in
this
family
at
any
rate
the
occasion
of
a
birth
did
not
lack
celebration
even
the
patient
was
curious
about
what
was
happening
downstairs
our
susan
doing
she
said
from
time
to
time
an
interminable
business
as
the
night
wore
on
it
grew
very
chilly
and
edwin
shivered
in
his
chair
the
case
hung
fire
unaccountably
and
in
this
the
first
of
many
such
cold
vigils
he
fell
into
a
strange
mood
often
to
be
repeated
in
which
the
sublime
influences
of
night
and
solitude
combined
to
purge
his
reflections
of
pettiness
and
showed
him
what
an
unimaginable
mystery
his
own
life
was
the
patient
fell
into
an
uneasy
doze
the
midwife
nodded
in
her
chair
snatching
up
her
head
with
a
conscious
jerk
whenever
it
lolled
over
her
fat
bosom
the
smelly
on
the
mantelpiece
gave
an
occasional
sputter
when
a
drop
of
water
was
sucked
up
into
the
wick
in
the
room
below
the
excited
talk
had
petered
out
and
only
a
sound
of
soft
snoring
was
heard
like
the
breathing
of
cows
in
a
byre
edwin
thought
of
many
things
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
mind
burned
clear
as
frosty
starlight
lighting
forgotten
memories
of
his
childhood
he
thought
of
his
own
mother
he
wondered
if
she
had
lain
like
the
woman
on
the
bed
on
the
night
when
he
was
born
he
wondered
if
it
had
been
in
the
least
like
this
and
whether
another
doctor
whose
name
he
did
not
even
know
had
sat
by
the
fireplace
in
the
little
room
at
halesby
waiting
and
seeing
his
own
life
stretched
out
before
him
in
this
light
of
perilous
clarity
he
thought
of
a
thousand
small
things
that
had
lain
submerged
for
years
and
now
appeared
unbidden
the
strangeness
of
his
own
experience
the
elements
of
linked
circumstance
that
had
combined
to
twist
his
life
into
its
present
state
and
make
him
what
he
was
he
thought
of
his
father
with
an
unusual
degree
of
charity
realising
that
this
man
too
was
no
more
than
a
slave
of
the
same
blind
influences
driven
hither
and
thither
in
spite
of
his
innate
goodwill
edwin
was
ashamed
to
think
that
he
had
been
angry
with
him
in
his
present
mood
it
seemed
to
him
an
unreasonable
thing
that
one
should
be
angry
with
any
human
creature
pity
yes
and
never
anger
so
like
a
devotee
in
a
tibetan
lamasery
he
saw
his
fellow
creatures
his
father
himself
the
midwife
and
the
woman
on
the
bed
bound
helpless
to
the
revolving
wheel
which
is
the
earth
and
the
earth
seemed
very
small
beneath
the
at
two
in
the
morning
the
handsome
girl
from
downstairs
who
was
the
sister
came
softly
into
the
room
and
asked
the
midwife
if
she
would
like
a
cup
of
tea
the
patient
blinked
at
het
with
red
eyes
is
it
going
sally
said
the
sister
all
right
i
suppose
got
to
be
worse
before
better
she
said
with
a
laugh
the
doctor
if
have
some
tea
edwin
accepted
gratefully
it
was
harsh
stuff
that
had
been
standing
on
the
hob
downstairs
for
some
hours
already
perkins
was
easily
persuaded
into
doctoring
hers
with
a
tablespoonful
of
brandy
from
the
bottle
that
is
a
regular
constituent
of
the
working
class
the
sister
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
stared
lazily
at
edwin
look
tired
doctor
she
said
edwin
admitted
that
he
had
had
a
biggish
day
ought
to
get
a
bit
of
sleep
said
the
dark
girl
there
no
spare
beds
in
the
house
but
you
can
turn
in
with
me
if
you
she
looked
so
daringly
provocative
that
edwin
had
a
horrible
suspicion
that
she
meant
it
but
it
was
evidently
the
sort
of
joke
that
greville
street
understood
for
the
patient
on
the
bed
cried
you
are
a
make
the
doctor
blush
and
perkins
rocked
with
laughter
until
she
spilt
her
tea
why
should
you
have
all
the
fun
sally
it
every
day
we
get
a
nice
young
man
in
the
said
the
patient
wryly
know
all
about
this
sort
of
fun
some
just
yet
thank
you
said
ethel
can
look
after
myself
better
than
she
went
downstairs
again
edwin
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
unhappy
about
the
case
to
his
inexperience
the
long
delay
seemed
abnormal
and
his
imagination
presented
to
him
a
series
of
textbook
disasters
while
he
stood
doubting
whether
he
should
give
himself
away
by
sending
to
the
hospital
for
the
he
was
startled
by
a
sudden
cry
now
at
any
rate
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
at
this
rate
he
thought
it
could
not
be
long
but
it
took
three
hours
three
hours
of
desperate
struggle
in
which
he
could
give
no
help
though
the
thing
was
so
fierce
that
he
found
his
sympathies
snatched
up
into
it
so
that
he
held
his
breath
and
clenched
his
hands
and
felt
his
own
temples
bursting
with
effort
there
had
been
no
experience
like
it
as
he
sat
at
the
bedside
with
the
fingers
clasped
about
his
wrist
he
had
the
feeling
that
this
woman
who
had
joked
with
him
half
an
hour
before
with
the
dry
courageous
cynicism
that
colours
the
philosophy
of
her
class
was
not
an
individual
human
soul
any
longer
not
a
woman
at
all
but
a
mass
of
straining
tortured
muscle
animated
by
the
first
force
of
life
so
it
had
been
since
the
first
woman
cried
out
in
the
night
under
the
tangles
of
caucasus
so
it
would
always
be
the
most
sublime
and
terrible
of
all
physical
experiences
a
state
of
sheer
physical
possession
more
powerful
than
any
spiritual
ecstasy
imaginable
at
five
the
baby
was
boy
and
perkins
standing
by
with
a
skein
of
twisted
thread
in
her
hand
danced
with
nervousness
hands
also
trembled
but
his
heart
was
lightened
with
a
sudden
relief
as
though
the
labour
had
been
his
and
his
also
the
accomplishment
a
palpably
ridiculous
state
of
mind
but
it
took
him
like
that
the
dark
girl
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
she
was
very
pale
now
had
the
whole
household
shared
in
these
physical
throes
it
all
right
she
said
a
boy
a
beautiful
eth
said
a
quiet
voice
from
the
bed
and
tell
it
was
the
first
word
the
patient
had
spoken
a
moment
later
she
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
in
a
dazed
way
at
edwin
she
smiled
she
was
a
woman
extraordinarily
chastened
somehow
strangely
beautiful
you
doctor
she
said
me
ever
so
did
i
very
bad
perkins
you
fine
said
perkins
wrapping
the
baby
in
a
blanket
and
putting
it
in
the
fender
the
patient
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
seemed
to
relapse
into
her
thoughts
from
time
to
time
she
would
say
a
couple
of
words
in
a
voice
eth
told
jim
she
asked
several
times
and
then
mother
think
be
quiet
my
lover
said
the
midwife
you
disturb
yourself
with
at
last
she
said
suddenly
better
now
and
asked
if
she
might
see
the
baby
perkins
unwrapped
the
blanket
from
a
red
and
frowning
forehead
and
showed
it
to
her
she
touched
its
cheek
with
her
finger
and
smiled
miraculously
the
action
seemed
to
bring
her
submerged
personality
to
the
surface
again
little
she
said
with
a
happy
laugh
as
if
been
on
the
forget
the
way
you
me
doctor
she
said
again
when
edwin
left
the
house
although
it
was
still
dark
the
trams
had
begun
to
run
and
lights
appeared
in
the
lower
windows
of
public
houses
where
hot
soup
was
on
sale
when
he
entered
the
bedroom
of
their
lodging
edwin
found
and
envied
boyce
sleeping
stertorously
with
the
blankets
pulled
over
his
head
and
an
overcoat
on
his
feet
three
hours
later
when
the
landlady
came
to
call
them
he
woke
and
explained
to
edwin
the
excitements
of
his
own
night
how
in
the
middle
of
it
own
higgins
had
called
him
out
little
woman
said
boyce
and
how
from
sixteen
granby
street
he
had
been
called
to
a
case
at
the
other
end
of
the
district
in
a
common
kept
by
a
pole
hot
water
no
soap
nothing
but
a
bucket
that
used
for
scrubbing
the
floors
not
even
a
bed
just
a
straw
mattress
with
a
couple
of
grey
blankets
on
it
two
other
children
and
a
man
in
the
room
and
crawling
stripped
and
had
a
rub
down
with
a
towel
but
i
feel
as
if
they
were
all
over
me
now
you
see
them
on
the
grey
blankets
you
dismal
had
they
a
capable
woman
my
perkins
up
to
my
dear
chap
they
run
to
luxuries
like
that
it
is
a
bit
thick
it
when
a
modern
is
reduced
to
washing
the
baby
with
his
own
soap
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
an
extraordinarily
interesting
performance
the
thing
felt
as
if
it
would
break
but
seriously
you
know
this
sort
of
thing
teaches
you
a
bit
about
twentieth
century
pretty
bad
said
edwin
one
thing
about
it
working
all
night
like
this
gives
you
a
terrific
iii
for
a
few
days
the
extreme
novelty
of
their
adventure
sustained
them
but
after
five
nights
of
broken
or
obliterated
sleep
the
presence
of
the
at
their
bedside
stood
for
a
symbol
of
perpetual
unrest
their
days
were
spent
in
visiting
patients
whom
they
had
attended
all
examination
work
was
made
impossible
by
the
fatigue
that
follows
want
of
sleep
and
the
fact
that
they
were
committed
to
a
kind
of
enforced
idleness
made
their
sojourn
in
easy
row
almost
as
much
a
holiday
as
the
great
summer
days
at
overton
both
of
them
found
that
they
could
not
even
read
for
pleasure
and
so
the
undisturbed
hours
of
the
day
were
passed
in
talk
and
in
music
piano
had
suffered
under
the
fingers
and
thumbs
of
countless
guests
but
edwin
and
boyce
shared
the
cost
of
a
tuner
and
worked
together
through
the
wagner
scores
and
the
subtler
treasures
that
lay
hidden
in
the
songs
of
hugo
wolf
they
had
few
visitors
for
this
community
of
taste
had
already
begun
to
isolate
them
from
their
student
friends
but
father
the
poet
often
came
to
have
tea
with
them
and
to
share
their
music
a
man
as
versatile
and
sanguine
as
roy
richmond
and
yet
so
versed
in
every
variety
of
knowledge
and
so
reverent
of
beauty
that
edwin
felt
there
was
no
such
company
in
the
world
one
who
took
all
beauty
and
knowledge
for
his
province
one
afternoon
a
message
came
to
the
house
in
easy
row
from
the
hospital
and
as
meadows
was
engaged
in
some
obscure
adjustment
of
her
toilet
edwin
went
to
the
door
to
receive
it
he
took
the
message
and
was
returning
when
another
figure
appeared
on
the
path
it
was
that
of
a
young
girl
of
his
own
age
or
perhaps
a
little
older
and
she
hurried
forward
when
she
saw
that
he
was
closing
the
door
he
waited
going
to
shut
me
out
were
you
she
said
she
smiled
and
edwin
saw
that
her
eyes
were
of
a
warm
hazel
such
as
sunshine
reveals
in
peaty
river
water
before
them
edwin
found
himself
blushing
indeed
he
said
you
want
meadows
go
and
tell
meadows
this
is
it
come
to
see
my
friend
miss
latham
lodging
so
sorry
of
course
i
expect
in
the
front
she
spoke
very
demurely
he
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
and
with
her
a
faint
fragrance
of
white
rose
by
this
time
miss
latham
herself
had
emerged
a
blowsy
woman
who
was
taking
a
small
part
in
the
christmas
pantomime
at
the
theatre
and
had
introduced
herself
to
the
friends
through
meadows
a
few
days
before
rosie
my
dear
this
just
sweet
of
you
fancy
finding
you
on
the
step
flirting
with
doctor
ingleby
right
it
what
a
shame
hetty
we
were
we
ingenuously
she
turned
her
eyes
on
edwin
again
were
they
hazel
perhaps
they
were
almost
amber
a
matter
of
light
afraid
we
she
give
us
doctors
in
the
house
think
of
that
said
miss
hetty
latham
whose
conversation
habitually
ran
from
one
note
of
exclamation
to
another
how
safe
we
feel
rosie
and
rosie
surveyed
edwin
seriously
you
awfully
young
suppose
i
am
rather
not
qualified
yet
but
i
expect
to
be
next
you
must
be
awfully
clever
on
earth
are
we
all
doing
talking
here
in
the
passage
come
along
in
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
said
miss
latham
boisterously
you
two
are
such
great
friends
already
i
suppose
waste
of
time
introducing
edwin
protested
well
then
ingleby
miss
rosie

never
get
the
order
right
you
can
take

of

chapter
x
white
roses
i
it
was
the
first
of
many
amazing
adventures
to
which
matthew
boyce
supplied
a
calculated
and
cynical
commentary
watching
edwin
as
though
he
were
the
subject
of
a
physiological
indeed
he
was
but
lack
of
sympathy
in
one
quarter
was
scarcely
likely
to
worry
edwin
when
he
had
found
it
so
overwhelmingly
in
another
in
a
few
days
miss
latham
the
most
tactful
of
duennas
had
withdrawn
from
the
scene
on
the
first
night
of
their
acquaintance
edwin
had
taken
the
miss
beaucaire
back
to
her
lodgings
in
prince
place
at
the
back
of
the
theatre
where
the
pantomime
was
in
rehearsal
all
the
way
through
the
squalid
streets
they
had
talked
of
things
that
were
entrancing
simply
because
they
had
to
do
with
her
edwin
thought
that
no
companionship
in
all
his
life
had
been
so
natural
and
so
easy
and
this
was
not
surprising
for
the
young
woman
in
addition
to
physical
charms
that
were
armoury
enough
in
themselves
had
developed
the
faculty
commonly
acquired
by
ladies
of
her
profession
of
devoting
herself
entirely
to
the
companion
of
the
moment
and
giving
the
impression
that
she
had
never
known
and
would
never
want
to
know
any
other
person
in
the
world
rosie
was
only
but
had
given
at
least
the
last
third
of
her
life
to
studying
male
of
the
species
of
which
edwin
was
a
peculiarly
ingenuous
example
at
the
door
of
her
lodgings
she
had
conjured
an
atmosphere
of
mysterious
intimacy
speaking
in
a
voice
that
was
low
and
of
a
thrilling
tenderness
she
had
said
ask
you
to
come
in
a
dreadful
shame
but
mother
has
one
of
her
headaches
and
the
noise
might
disturb
her
you
understand
you
edwin
with
a
vision
of
an
elderly
and
delicate
version
of
rosie
herself
lying
on
a
sofa
with
a
handkerchief
dipped
in
over
her
eyes
assented
he
thought
it
a
very
beautiful
consideration
on
part
a
small
black
and
tan
terrier
came
dancing
into
the
hall
with
a
friendly
yelp
quiet
imp
oh
be
quiet
he
a
duck
she
said
i
must
really
she
held
out
her
hand
a
moment
before
she
had
taken
off
her
glove
and
edwin
who
had
scarcely
ever
touched
the
hand
of
a
woman
before
thought
that
her
fingers
were
the
softest
and
most
delicate
things
on
earth
come
and
have
tea
with
us
you
i
should
like
you
to
meet
course
like
to
when
quite
soon
any
day
this
week
promise
me
you
forget
as
if
he
could
ever
forget
her
exquisite
humility
quite
bowled
him
over
when
she
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
he
walked
away
dazed
with
an
unfamiliar
emotion
that
made
the
mean
street
with
its
uniform
row
of
houses
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
blank
wall
of
the
theatre
and
huge
sooty
warehouses
seem
a
holy
place
the
halesby
road
with
its
streaming
traffic
shared
the
same
transfiguration
the
speed
and
strength
of
the
horses
enthralled
him
the
faces
of
men
and
women
walking
homeward
from
their
work
in
the
city
seemed
triumphantly
happy
the
smooth
polished
by
the
rolling
of
innumerable
wheels
shone
like
a
street
in
heaven
it
seemed
to
edwin
as
if
the
whole
world
had
somehow
been
uplifted
by
a
secret
knowledge
of
his
own
experience
a
night
of
what
is
the
young
name
asked
boyce
when
he
returned
to
easy
row
principal

the
pantomime

the
attractive
little

anything
about

for

yourself
a

of
that
kind
generally
has
a
fair
share
of
experience
and
you
well
you
exactly
besides
just
as
well
to
remember
that

you
know
if
met
her
i
think
admit
that
a
lady
she
told
me
that
her
boyce

a
matter
of

said
edwin
clinching
the
argument
father
was
a
country
parson
in
low
understand
they
usually
are
said
boyce
with
a
yawn
their
night
was
complicated
by
two
new
cases
next
morning
they
appeared
at
breakfast
with
slightly
ruffled
tempers
they
sat
at
opposite
ends
of
the
table
edwin
reading
without
understanding
one
of
caustic
critiques
on
a
symphony
concert
the
night
before
his
friend
glued
to
his
beloved
anthology
did
you
say
her
name
was
said
boyce
apropos
of
nothing
it
edwin
grunted
you
ever
sampled
the
i
sometimes
try
that
trick
with
the
anthology
there
are
plenty
of
generalisations
so
it
often
comes
off
rather
well
this
for
last
night
you
listening

or
both
of

anyway
said
edwin
the
wrong
word
it
comforted
him
none
the
less
to
find
that
rosie
did
not
revisit
miss
latham
though
this
lady
pointedly
rallied
him
on
the
doorstep
suggesting
that
his
intimacy
with
miss
beaucaire
had
reached
a
stage
to
which
he
had
not
yet
attained
but
aspired
devoutly
the
work
at
easy
row
that
had
slackened
for
a
few
days
came
on
with
a
rush
and
though
the
image
of
this
delicate
creature
now
filled
his
nightly
vigils
being
even
more
precious
for
the
squalid
surroundings
in
which
it
came
to
him
he
found
it
impossible
to
visit
the
lodgings
in
prince
place
to
which
his
thoughts
with
tantalising
regularity
returned
the
flood
of
work
held
until
their
fortnight
was
out
leaving
them
both
and
irritable
to
speak
frankly
the
last
few
days
of
their
comradeship
had
not
been
a
success
although
edwin
made
it
clear
that
he
wish
to
discuss
the
affair
of
rosie
with
boyce
the
incident
of
the
greek
epigram
rankled
he
found
it
impossible
to
take
the
matter
lightly
feeling
that
it
was
necessary
to
convince
himself
at
all
costs
that
he
making
a
fool
of
himself
and
finding
it
difficult
to
do
so
on
the
monday
next
before
the
final
examination
he
found
himself
a
free
man
it
was
a
questionable
liberty
for
its
enjoyment
really
depended
on
the
result
of
this
ordeal
he
had
definitely
severed
his
connection
with
harris
intending
to
devote
all
his
spare
time
at
easy
row
and
the
week
after
to
preparations
for
the
exam
a
big
ten
pounds
and
a
few
shillings
was
all
he
possessed
in
the
world
except
a
problematical
degree
in
medicine
which
in
another
seven
days
might
make
him
certain
of
four
guineas
a
week
as
long
as
he
chose
to
work
the
margin
seemed
so
small
and
the
chance
so
desperate
that
he
burned
the
last
of
his
boats
selling
his
microscope
to
a
pawnbroker
for
twelve
pounds
one
could
do
a
lot
with
pounds
supposing
nothing
went
wrong
he
found
a
cheap
in
a
quiet
street
at
the
back
of
the
university
buildings
here
and
in
the
museums
he
would
be
able
to
put
in
a
week
of
intensive
cramming
he
found
that
he
do
it
he
had
reckoned
without
the
unreasonable
quantity
of
rosie
the
first
night
on
which
he
settled
down
to
read
in
his
new
lodging
the
thought
of
her
would
not
let
him
rest
it
was
ridiculous
what
he
wanted
was
a
hard
walk
he
would
go
up
to
alvaston
and
rout
boyce
out
of
his
study
for
a
tramp
in
the
moonlight
towards
southfield
beeches
he
would
apologise
to
boyce
for
his
bearishness
during
the
last
few
days
they
assured
each
other
on
one
of
their
ambrosial
evenings
at
overton
more
than
a
year
ago
that
the
friendship
of
two
men
was
a
more
precious
and
lasting
experience
than
anything
that
the
love
of
a
woman
could
give
the
whole
thing
was
just
the
result
of
physical
staleness
a
symptom
of
the
monotonous
fatigue
of
the
last
year
he
was
going
to
get
rid
of
it
at
all
costs
he
turned
out
the
gas
and
went
downstairs
it
was
a
discouraging
night
a
soft
winter
drizzle
had
set
in
from
the
west
and
in
the
jaded
halesby
road
nebulous
street
lamps
were
reflected
in
a
layer
of
black
slime
that
covered
the
the
shop
windows
were
misted
with
rain
and
the
few
people
who
had
ventured
out
into
the
street
trod
carefully
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
slipping
a
brutal
night
if
ever
there
was
one
plodding
up
the
street
with
the
rain
in
his
face
he
found
that
he
was
passing
the
end
of
prince
place
he
passed
it
by
twenty
paces
and
then
almost
against
his
will
turned
round
again
it
was
no
good
there
she
was
for
certain
within
forty
yards
of
him
if
he
were
to
walk
along
the
road
on
the
opposite
side
under
the
blank
walls
of
the
warehouses
he
would
be
able
to
see
the
very
room
that
held
her
exquisiteness
he
did
so
there
was
a
light
in
the
front
room
of
the
lower
story
but
the
blinds
were
down
and
he
could
not
see
any
one
inside
he
crossed
the
road
boldly
and
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
doorstep
it
gave
him
a
peculiar
stab
of
happiness
to
feel
so
near
her
he
railed
against
the
combination
of
shyness
and
convention
that
held
him
for
if
he
were
to
do
the
thing
that
was
reasonable
and
downright
he
would
have
walked
straight
into
the
house
and
told
her
the
thousand
things
that
choked
his
would
have
kissed
her
soft
hands
and
gazed
into
her
shy
adorable
eyes
yes
he
would
have
kissed
her
eyes
too
no
doubt
it
would
rather
have
taken
the
breath
away
probably
rosie
had
never
given
him
another
thought
since
he
left
her
on
the
doorstep
that
was
the
funny
part
of
it
he
laughed
at
himself
and
the
sound
of
his
laugh
must
somehow
have
penetrated
the
hall
for
the
black
and
tan
terrier
barked
shrilly
off
my
head
you
know
he
said
to
himself
and
wandered
off
again
into
the
wet
streets
walking
until
the
small
hours
those
unimaginable
slums
in
which
his
labours
of
the
last
fortnight
had
lain
ridiculous
he
thought
a
man
help
falling
in
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
phantom
of
dorothy
powys
regarded
him
seriously
ii
next
afternoon
he
presented
himself
at
prince
place
a
landlady
who
might
well
have
been
sister
took
in
his
card
and
after
a
little
buzz
of
conversation
that
might
have
been
explained
in
a
dozen
sinister
ways
he
was
admitted
to
the
little
room
whose
lighted
windows
he
had
surveyed
the
night
before
rosie
came
forward
to
meet
him
once
again
trembling
he
took
her
hand
he
even
flattery
she
blushed
is
my
friend
ingleby
mother
she
said
pleased
to
meet
you
sure
said
beaucaire
you
come
and
sit
over
here
in
the
shadow
of
beaucaire
edwin
took
his
seat
she
was
a
large
woman
with
a
husky
voice
and
a
big
dissipated
face
that
had
once
been
handsome
if
she
had
any
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
it
was
surely
as
a
foil
to
the
fragile
grace
of
her
daughter
rosie
with
an
occasional
sideways
glance
was
busy
talking
to
a
little
man
with
a
blue
shaven
chin
and
an
immense
mobile
mouth
who
looked
like
a
bookie
suppose
you
know
mr
flood
said
beaucaire
edwin
confessed
that
he
did
not
mr
flood
you
know
bertie
this
is
i
beg
your
pardon
ingleby
and
the
great
comedian
shook
hands
with
edwin
and
hoped
he
was
well
the
atmosphere
of
the
lodgings
was
very
easy
and
familiar
bertie
flood
the
of
three
continents
as
the
newspapers
described
him
devoted
himself
in
an
easy
paternal
manner
to
rosie
it
became
apparent
to
edwin
overshadowed
by
the
bulk
and
impressiveness
of
beaucaire
that
whenever
mr
flood
could
make
an
opportunity
of
handling
rosie
he
did
so
and
also
that
rosie
did
not
in
any
way
resent
the
process
it
even
seemed
to
him
that
she
invited
attentions
very
unconventional
people
you
know
bohemian
said
beaucaire
in
a
thick
voice
edwin
agreed
that
the
relation
was
delightful
it
was
only
by
an
effort
of
concentration
that
he
could
hear
what
the
mother
was
saying
all
the
time
his
eyes
were
on
rosie
so
divinely
fragile
in
her
white
muslin
blouse
he
shuddered
when
bertie
flood
touched
her
nothing
but
the
delightful
innocence
of
the
girl
could
have
induced
her
to
suffer
the
presence
of
this
satyr
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
doing
all
that
she
could
to
please
my
poor
husband
the
vicar
i
always
call
you
a
small
parish
in
the
north
of
england
i
have
a
son
in
the
church
too
both
he
and
rosie
really
take
after
the
exactly
said
edwin
in
that
moment
rosie
had
smiled
at
him
and
the
smile
was
enough
god
what
a
woman
vicar
came
from
a
very
old
family
in
the
north
it
is
recognised
but
in
a
place
like
north
bromwich
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
meet
the
right
sort
of
people
i
have
to
be
very
careful
for
sake
the
child
is
so
trusting
i
was
so
glad
you
know
when
she
told
me
that
she
had
met
you
at
miss
one
feels
so
safe
with
a
doctor
be
able
to
look
after
her
a
bit
see
that
she
get
too
tired
pantomime
is
very
tiring
you
know
i
myself
suffer
agonies
from
indigestion
what
with
that
and
my
headaches
afraid
a
poor
companion
for
her
as
i
say
both
the
children
take
after
the
dear
vicar
rosie
a
bit
like
said
edwin
still
dazed
by
the
memory
of
her
smile
but
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
met
those
of
beaucaire
and
he
saw
to
his
amazement
that
they
were
really
the
eyes
of
rosie
that
her
discoloured
nose
had
once
been
of
the
same
shape
as
her
that
the
sagging
sensual
mouth
was
in
fact
a
degraded
version
of
too
it
was
a
revelation
blasphemous
but
prophetic
he
would
not
consider
it
he
dared
not
look
at
her
a
moment
later
bertie
flood
left
them
tea
much
in
his
line
he
said
and
his
complexion
confirmed
the
assertion
beaucaire
saw
him
to
the
door
edwin
and
rosie
were
alone
it
was
a
wonderful
minute
he
felt
that
she
could
never
seem
more
beautiful
more
delicate
more
exquisite
than
at
this
moment
standing
in
her
pale
loveliness
against
the
grimy
wallpaper
with
her
hands
clasped
before
her
had
to
come
he
said
had
been
expecting
you
awfully
glad
you
found
found
time
he
wanted
to
tell
her
of
his
strange
adventure
of
the
night
before
how
he
had
stood
in
the
dripping
rain
beneath
her
window
hungry
for
the
sight
of
her
unsatisfied
she
stood
as
though
she
would
be
glad
to
listen
but
there
was
no
time
beaucaire
after
a
noisy
and
pointed
demonstration
in
the
hall
it
seemed
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
take
his
departure
not
going
so
soon
she
said
and
he
stayed
it
was
all
delightfully
intimate
and
domestic
these
people
seemed
to
possess
the
rare
faculty
of
putting
a
visitor
as
shy
as
edwin
at
his
ease
beaucaire
did
most
of
the
talking
enlarging
on
devotion
to
the
parson
brother
regretting
that
circumstance
and
possibly
the
unreasonable
prejudice
of
country
people
against
theatrical
connections
had
deprived
him
of
the
family
living
and
rosie
listened
quietly
more
compelling
in
her
demure
silences
than
beaucaire
at
her
most
impressive
once
or
twice
in
the
afternoon
that
lady
tactfully
left
them
returning
each
time
with
a
renewed
vigour
and
a
scent
that
suggested
the
combination
of
and
brandy
these
solitary
moments
were
very
precious
to
edwin
neither
of
them
spoke
more
than
a
few
words
but
the
air
between
them
seemed
charged
with
emotion
it
was
six
when
he
left
prince
place
forget
us
will
you
said
beaucaire
with
enthusiasm
will
be
so
nice
for
rosie
to
have
some
one
to
take
her
to
rehearsal
i
like
her
mixing
with
the
boys
in
the
company
it
the
thing
and
we
happen
to
have
any
really
nice
friends
in
the
midlands
in
the
north
it
would
have
been
quite
a
delirious
week
slipped
by
in
spite
of
every
resolution
edwin
had
found
it
impossible
to
work
his
new
lodging
was
not
inspiring
but
this
was
only
one
of
the
excuses
that
he
invented
to
salve
his
conscience
he
knew
the
real
reason
for
this
divine
unreasonable
restlessness
even
if
it
were
to
wreck
his
chances
in
the
final
examination
it
could
not
be
avoided
and
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
be
excused
he
knew
that
he
was
in
love
and
before
this
unquestionable
miracle
he
abased
himself
beaucaire
now
satisfied
that
she
could
indulge
a
and
take
to
her
bed
as
often
as
she
chose
did
not
question
his
presence
at
prince
place
she
was
even
ready
on
occasion
to
treat
it
with
a
mild
facetiousness
rosie
who
lapped
up
adoration
as
naturally
as
a
kitten
takes
to
milk
treated
it
as
a
matter
of
course
edwin
rather
wished
that
she
take
as
a
matter
of
course
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
there
was
a
passivity
in
her
acquiescence
that
filled
him
with
a
fear
that
she
was
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
or
even
a
little
bored
by
it
she
mopped
up
his
devotions
with
an
ease
that
would
have
been
disconcerting
if
he
had
not
always
been
bemused
by
her
beauty
surely
it
was
enough
that
she
should
be
beautiful
in
the
beaucaire
always
had
a
headache
of
another
kind
next
would
escort
rosie
to
her
rehearsal
at
the
theatre
he
became
familiar
with
the
frowsty
box
in
which
the
lame
sat
like
an
obscene
spider
guarding
the
board
on
which
the
letters
were
kept
the
man
came
to
know
him
and
would
pass
him
in
through
the
swinging
doors
with
a
peculiarly
evil
leer
sometimes
at
the
stage
door
they
would
become
involved
in
a
mass
of
chorus
and
edwin
would
thrill
at
the
dignity
and
refinement
with
which
rosie
in
her
white
fox
furs
would
slip
through
this
vulgar
tumult
so
to
the
stage
with
its
vast
cobwebbed
walls
its
huge
echoes
and
the
mysterious
darkness
of
the
flies
where
looped
ropes
and
grimy
festoons
of
forgotten
scenery
hung
still
as
seaweed
in
a
deep
sea
there
in
the
sour
and
characteristic
odour
of
an
empty
stage
edwin
would
wait
for
her
in
a
little
alcove
of
the
whitewashed
wall
in
which
iron
cleats
were
piled
and
the
unmeaning
murmur
of
the
rehearsal
would
come
to
him
mingled
with
the
shrill
voice
of
the
producer
who
ended
every
sentence
with
the
words
dear
or
boy
and
the
noise
of
the
carpenter
hammering
wood
in
the
flies
his
original
acquaintance
miss
latham
discreetly
avoided
him
but
the
comedian
bertie
flood
seemed
inclined
to
be
familiar
one
morning
he
dragged
edwin
off
to
his
dressing
room
for
a
smoke
he
sat
with
his
legs
on
either
side
of
a
chair
his
bowler
on
the
back
of
his
head
looking
more
than
ever
like
a
bookie
old
boy
he
said
goes
it
the
little
beaucaire
all
right
as
far
as
i
know
said
edwin
who
was
inclined
to
resent
the
description
had
any
headaches
lately
i
know
what
headaches
will
end
in
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
a
doctor
you
well
i
know
all
about
that
had
it
myself
just
realised
in
time
that
it
pay
now
i
never
touch
anything
but
gin
do
you
want
a
word
of
advice
edwin
thanked
him
seem
funny
from
a
chap
that
gets
two
hundred
a
week
for
making
a
damn
fool
of
at
all
said
edwin
politely
if
take
my
advice
go
easy
in
that
direction
treat
it
as
a
business
proposition
a
bad
old
woman
only
tell
her
i
said
so
you
see
a
friend
of
the
family
dear
little
girl
rosie
too
always
let
think
i
was
at
for
it
was
rather
disturbing
for
though
it
was
no
news
to
edwin
that
headaches
were
euphemistic
the
fact
had
done
no
more
than
contribute
to
the
ideal
qualities
with
which
he
had
invested
her
daughter
there
was
something
romantic
as
well
as
pitiful
in
the
idea
of
contrasting
innocence
the
rose
that
has
its
roots
in
foulness
is
not
less
a
rose
it
had
even
seemed
to
him
that
the
complete
collapse
of
beaucaire
might
throw
rosie
into
his
arms
a
situation
that
would
be
full
of
romantic
and
tender
possibilities
and
the
inimitably
virginal
air
was
enough
to
convince
him
that
bertie
other
suggestions
were
no
more
than
the
natural
products
of
a
mind
degraded
by
the
atmosphere
of
the
he
was
convinced
too
that
he
had
no
cause
for
jealousy
ever
since
he
had
first
visited
her
rosie
had
never
spent
more
than
a
few
hours
of
daylight
out
of
his
sight
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
before
the
examination
his
confidence
suffered
something
of
a
shock
it
was
a
raw
winter
morning
but
he
had
set
his
heart
on
taking
her
into
his
own
and
she
with
her
usual
sweet
submission
but
without
a
hint
of
enthusiasm
had
consented
he
had
planned
to
avoid
the
halesby
side
of
the
range
and
to
approach
it
from
the
southern
escarpment
early
in
the
morning
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
in
the
arcade
where
he
bought
a
bunch
of
pale
exotic
roses
white
roses
that
should
match
her
own
sweetness
and
fragility
once
she
had
expressed
a
general
liking
for
flowers
and
since
then
it
had
been
his
delight
to
give
them
to
her
she
mopped
up
his
flowers
and
his
passion
with
the
same
dreamy
passivity
from
the
corner
of
the
place
he
saw
a
weedy
figure
in
front
of
number
ten
and
as
he
approached
the
figure
entered
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
edwin
wondered
vaguely
if
it
might
be
the
parson
brother
the
landlady
opened
the
door
in
a
flurry
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
wanted
to
conceal
something
think
miss
beaucaire
can
see
you
for
a
bit
she
said
you
call
later
in
the
morning
he
told
her
that
he
would
wait
as
they
had
an
appointment
and
a
train
to
catch
will
you
kindly
wait
in
my
room
you
take
any
notice
of
the
state
in
she
said
still
on
the
defensive
the
state
of
the
room
was
not
inspiriting
on
a
dirty
table
cloth
lay
the
remains
of
last
supper
on
the
window
sill
stood
a
chevaux
de
frise
of
empty
brandy
bottles
that
edwin
help
associating
with
beaucaire
the
covered
with
dirty
chintz
overalls
that
suggested
a
layer
of
more
ancient
dirt
beneath
were
not
inviting
he
preferred
to
stand
the
house
was
as
quiet
and
secretive
as
usual
but
from
the
next
room
he
heard
an
irritating
rumour
of
voices
one
of
the
voices
he
could
have
sworn
was
a
little
later
he
heard
a
laugh
and
the
suspicion
became
a
disquieting
certainty
for
the
laugh
was
one
that
he
knew
a
difference
it
was
as
if
beaucaire
had
laughed
with
voice
he
found
it
difficult
to
restrain
himself
from
bursting
into
the
room
and
settling
the
matter
once
and
for
all
again
the
then
a
long
silence
he
heard
steps
in
the
passage
a
whispered
conversation
with
the
landlady
and
then
rosie
came
in
to
him
flushed
and
with
her
fair
hair
disordered
he
could
not
speak
he
only
gave
her
the
roses
you
eddie
she
said
scarcely
noticing
them
her
lips
were
parted
and
her
eyes
shone
with
excitement
she
had
never
seemed
to
him
more
beautiful
but
there
was
something
frightening
in
her
beauty
is
the
matter
with
you
she
said
do
you
look
so
serious
was
your
visitor
it
is
it
you
silly
boy
you
surely
mean
to
say
jealous
tell
was
only
a
priest
i
had
to
make
my
priest
i
thought
your
people
belonged
to
the
church
of
prevent
me
from
being
a
catholic
much
better
for
professional
girls
to
be
catholics
they
look
after
you
when
on
the
he
could
not
say
any
more
about
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
eyes
were
anxious
as
though
she
were
not
quite
sure
how
much
he
had
heard
believe
me
you
she
spoke
in
a
frightened
whisper
course
i
do
just
time
for
our
train
you
are
coming
you
she
said
course
i
am
and
ran
upstairs
singing
to
put
her
hat
on
the
roses
lay
neglected
on
the
sideboard
where
she
had
placed
them
in
five
minutes
she
returned
thoroughly
dressed
for
her
new
role
of
country
girl
with
brogued
shoes
and
a
short
skirt
of
harris
tweed
ready
she
said
gaily
it
was
a
wonderful
day
they
walked
together
under
dull
skies
that
made
the
berries
in
the
hedgerows
and
the
waning
fires
of
autumn
glow
more
brightly
and
even
ministered
to
the
own
beauty
the
cool
air
and
the
walking
made
her
cheeks
glow
with
a
colour
that
was
natural
and
therefore
unusual
edwin
was
so
entranced
with
her
companionship
that
he
forgot
his
anxiousness
of
the
morning
so
lost
in
the
amazing
beauty
of
her
hazel
eyes
and
her
soft
contour
that
he
did
not
notice
that
she
was
limping
halfway
to
the
summit
of
the
hills
she
stopped
gave
a
little
sigh
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
a
hedge
awfully
sorry
eddie
my
foot
hurts
i
think
this
too
look
simply
know
i
only
bought
them
specially
for
ridiculous
to
go
for
a
long
walk
in
new
shoes
you
mind
if
i
take
them
off
for
a
minute
course
not
let
me
undo
the
he
knelt
at
her
feet
it
was
a
wonderful
and
thrilling
experience
to
loosen
the
laces
to
feel
her
small
feet
in
their
smooth
silk
stockings
his
hands
trembled
wish
you
touch
my
feet
awfully
sorry
one
of
the
things
i
bear
you
mind
do
you
blame
me
so
she
smiled
her
modesty
delighted
him
sitting
there
together
so
miraculously
alone
he
began
to
talk
about
his
future
see
you
for
a
whole
week
it
will
be
unbearable
but
when
the
exam
is
over
and
qualified
it
will
be
such
a
relief
i
shall
feel
able
to
say
the
things
that
i
want
to
say
to
for
a
long
time
she
was
silent
then
she
said
are
you
expecting
to
do
think
i
shall
go
in
for
one
of
the
services
what
do
you
think
of
the
indian
medical
it
would
be
wonderful
to
see
india
always
thought
that
i
should
like
to
know
something
of
the
world
i
think
a
good
life
women
generally
love
it
what
do
you
think
about
it
should
think
it
would
be
rather
nice
but
it
be
awfully
hot
known
one
or
two
boys
in
the
indian
army
lots
of
dancing
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
he
laughed
dancing
his
strong
point
as
professor
beagle
could
have
told
her
and
in
any
case
india
mean
dancing
to
him
she
did
not
seem
at
all
anxious
to
pursue
the
subject
think
we
could
walk
back
to
the
hotel
now
she
said
simply
they
walked
down
the
hill
together
almost
in
silence
when
they
reached
the
hotel
she
disappeared
in
the
company
of
the
barmaid
leaving
edwin
to
wait
for
her
in
the
he
almost
resented
her
absence
he
felt
that
he
spare
her
for
a
moment
waiting
at
the
table
he
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
bromwich
gazing
idly
at
the
front
page
he
caught
sight
of
his
own
name
it
was
the
announcement
of
a
wedding
ingleby
fellows
on
the
tenth
of
december
at
the
parish
church
halesby
john
ingleby
to
julia
elder
daughter
of
the
late
joseph
fellows
of
mawne
staffs
he
was
overwhelmed
with
a
sudden
indescribable
emotion
that
was
neither
jealousy
anger
nor
shame
but
curiously
near
to
all
three
he
sat
bewildered
with
the
paper
in
front
of
him
rosie
returned
to
find
him
blankly
staring
the
matter
with
you
you
look
as
if
seen
a
i
think
i
have
nothing
really
nothing
at
he
drank
more
than
he
need
have
done
of
a
villainous
wine
that
was
labelled
but
had
probably
been
pressed
on
the
hot
of
oran
in
the
train
on
the
way
home
he
felt
flushed
and
sleepy
but
all
the
time
divinely
conscious
of
the
warmth
and
softness
of
rosie
sitting
beside
him
they
were
alone
in
the
carriage
sleepy
too
she
said
he
drew
her
gently
to
his
side
and
she
rested
content
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
in
the
wonder
of
this
he
forgot
the
newspaper
and
its
staggering
contents
as
they
neared
north
bromwich
she
stood
up
in
front
of
the
mirror
to
arrange
her
hair
and
edwin
pulling
himself
together
saw
that
his
blue
coat
was
floured
with
a
fine
bloom
of
powder
she
still
found
it
difficult
to
walk
and
so
they
drove
in
a
hansom
to
prince
place
very
grimy
and
sinister
in
the
dusk
ring
she
said
taking
out
a
latchkey
and
showing
him
into
the
narrow
hall
be
very
quiet
so
as
not
to
disturb
think
come
in
he
said
he
knew
that
he
must
make
an
end
somewhere
even
to
be
thanked
enjoyed
myself
most
she
stood
before
him
in
the
gloom
of
the
hall
as
though
she
were
waiting
for
something
it
felt
as
if
the
dark
space
between
them
must
break
into
flame
their
lips
met
god
how
wonderful
you
are
he
said
week
she
whispered
iii
edwin
had
arranged
to
spend
the
following
day
with
the
boyces
at
their
house
in
alvaston
he
found
it
difficult
to
contain
himself
for
the
delicious
memory
of
their
parting
the
night
before
swamped
his
efforts
at
conversation
with
the
persistency
of
waves
that
follow
one
another
in
a
rising
tide
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
his
state
should
not
be
evident
to
the
whole
household
and
particularly
to
matthew
who
knew
him
so
well
in
the
afternoon
when
they
sat
smoking
together
in
study
at
the
top
of
the
house
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
a
confession
the
only
thing
that
restrained
him
from
it
was
the
memory
of
the
epigram
and
of
his
translation
he
felt
in
his
bones
that
boyce
would
not
be
sympathetic
and
though
his
infatuation
suggested
that
he
much
care
whether
boyce
were
sympathetic
or
suspicious
an
intuitive
dread
of
suspicion
and
its
possible
effects
on
his
own
reason
made
him
hold
his
tongue
it
was
in
the
nature
of
boyce
who
happen
for
the
moment
to
be
in
love
to
be
critical
to
sweep
away
perfections
in
a
generalisation
and
the
appeal
of
a
generalisation
to
the
mind
of
youth
is
so
strong
that
edwin
was
afraid
to
hear
it
somewhere
in
his
submerged
reason
he
admitted
that
judgment
on
the
matter
would
probably
be
sound
and
reason
was
the
last
tribunal
in
the
world
before
which
he
wished
this
exceptional
case
to
be
presented
an
unsatisfactory
day
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
relations
of
the
two
friends
were
indefinitely
strained
he
left
alvaston
early
in
the
evening
on
his
way
to
his
lodging
he
passed
the
gloomy
entrance
to
prince
place
it
would
have
been
easy
so
easy
to
call
at
number
ten
but
he
had
determined
once
and
for
all
that
the
examination
week
should
be
free
from
distractions
and
pride
in
his
own
strength
of
mind
held
him
to
his
course
though
he
realised
almost
gladly
that
even
if
he
were
master
of
his
feet
he
could
not
control
his
thoughts
he
wondered
if
he
would
dream
of
her
next
day
the
rigours
of
the
final
examination
overtook
him
this
was
the
supreme
ordeal
in
which
every
moment
of
his
professional
life
from
the
day
when
he
first
entered
the
dissecting
room
to
the
night
of
the
last
midwifery
case
would
stand
the
test
of
scrutiny
he
was
not
exactly
afraid
of
it
he
knew
that
his
knowledge
and
technical
skill
were
at
least
above
the
average
of
his
year
and
felt
that
with
ordinary
luck
he
would
be
among
the
first
four
of
a
field
of
twelve
the
year
was
not
one
of
exceptional
brilliance
and
comparisons
were
therefore
in
his
favour
on
the
first
day
in
the
examination
on
surgery
he
did
for
one
moment
lose
his
head
but
when
once
he
had
pulled
himself
together
and
accustomed
himself
to
the
conditions
of
the
test
he
settled
down
into
a
state
of
fatalistic
equanimity
taking
the
rough
with
the
smooth
and
deciding
that
on
the
whole
he
was
not
likely
to
make
a
hopeless
fool
of
himself
on
the
first
night
he
went
to
bed
early
but
on
the
second
feeling
that
his
mind
would
be
clearer
for
some
diversion
he
went
to
a
with
and
his
wife
drinking
beer
in
the
bar
with
his
friend
he
suddenly
heard
his
name
called
and
felt
a
tap
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
to
find
himself
in
front
of
a
face
that
was
curiously
familiar
and
in
a
moment
found
that
he
was
shaking
hands
with
widdup
a
small
and
rather
chastened
widdup
who
spoke
to
him
with
the
slow
precise
voice
that
he
had
known
at
thought
it
was
you
ingleby
he
said
wondered
if
i
should
run
across
avoiding
a
display
on
the
slack
wire
they
stood
talking
widdup
it
appeared
had
been
destined
for
an
engineering
career
in
north
bromwich
when
his
mathematical
genius
had
won
him
a
scholarship
at
cambridge
pity
in
a
way
for
i
should
have
seen
more
of
you
i
suppose
that
sort
of
thing
always
happens
to
school
at
present
he
was
visiting
a
firm
of
on
business
they
talked
together
of
old
times
of
the
day
when
edwin
greatly
daring
had
seen
the
birches
run
of
the
languid
selby
now
of
a
small
in
norfolk
and
of
old
fat
leeming
between
the
conscious
effort
of
remembering
and
the
unbidden
image
of
rosie
head
was
in
a
whirl
old
griffin
said
widdup
another
funny
thing
i
ran
slap
into
him
in
the
lounge
of
the
grand
midland
up
to
the
same
old
games
you
know
yes
he
had
a
girl
with
him
rather
an
attractive
little
piece
something
to
do
with
the
pantomime
he
told
me
what
was
her
name
the
old
brute
introduced
me
too
yes
i
think
got
it
beaucaire
rosie
beaucaire
rather
a
rosy
prospect
for
old
griff
i
should
imagine
why
what
the
the
matter
with
you
all
right
thanks
said
edwin
this
you
know
have
another
he
called
for
whisky
and
soda
said
widdup
edwin
polished
off
a
couple
of
drinks
and
then
told
widdup
that
he
must
rejoin
his
friend
leaving
him
staggered
at
his
abrupt
departure
he
rejoin
he
walked
straight
out
of
the
theatre
and
off
up
the
halesby
road
he
had
determined
to
go
straight
to
lodgings
and
thrash
the
matter
out
but
by
the
time
he
reached
prince
place
he
had
thought
better
of
it
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
he
reflected
that
griffin
should
know
the
beaucaires
for
griffin
was
constantly
in
touch
with
theatrical
people
it
was
even
natural
that
griffin
knowing
her
should
take
rosie
to
the
grand
midland
it
was
the
obvious
thing
to
do
if
you
had
money
to
spend
as
griffin
had
it
would
be
just
like
the
irony
of
fate
he
reflected
if
griffin
should
afflict
him
with
unhappiness
in
this
case
as
he
had
done
in
so
many
others
he
remembered
the
bitter
sufferings
of
those
early
days
at
that
widdup
had
so
clearly
recalled
he
remembered
dorothy
powys
and
the
dance
at
mawne
his
suspicions
his
agonised
resentment
even
more
darkly
there
came
to
him
the
memory
of
a
voice
in
surgery
a
conviction
never
yet
established
that
griffin
had
no
right
to
know
any
woman
this
reflection
he
knew
implied
a
doubt
of
innocence
an
imputation
that
he
could
not
possibly
admit
and
yet
and
yet
he
remembered
the
warning
that
bertie
flood
had
given
him
in
his
dressing
room
he
remembered
the
visitor
in
the
black
coat
four
days
before
his
mind
was
in
hell
in
this
purgatory
of
doubt
and
horror
he
lived
for
the
rest
of
the
week
in
the
daytime
the
progress
of
the
examination
engrossed
him
but
at
night
he
always
found
himself
hanging
about
the
darkness
of
prince
place
hoping
against
hope
that
his
suspicions
were
unfounded
not
daring
to
put
them
to
the
test
lest
they
should
be
confirmed
on
friday
night
when
the
last
of
his
medical
ordeals
was
over
he
went
straight
to
number
ten
it
was
a
wonderful
moment
now
with
a
clear
conscience
he
might
see
her
again
now
once
more
he
could
know
the
ecstasy
of
her
kisses
and
forget
the
ungenerous
nightmare
in
which
he
had
lived
through
the
later
stages
of
the
exam
he
approached
the
dirty
doorway
with
his
heart
beating
wildly
at
first
his
ring
was
unanswered
but
a
little
later
the
landlady
came
to
the
door
with
a
red
suspicious
face
opening
it
jealously
as
though
she
feared
to
let
him
in
he
inquired
for
miss
beaucaire
miss
beaucaire
was
out
did
the
woman
know
when
she
was
expected
to
return
she
the
least
idea
was
beaucaire
in
then
beaucaire
was
in
but
invisible
beaucaire
had
one
of
her
headaches
edwin
suggested
that
he
should
wait
in
their
room
impossible
beaucaire
was
lying
down
there
he
hung
upon
the
doorstep
as
if
he
were
waiting
at
the
gates
of
paradise
at
last
the
landlady
took
it
upon
herself
to
close
the
door
she
must
have
thought
he
was
mad
perhaps
he
was
for
an
hour
or
more
he
waited
in
the
rain
it
occurred
to
him
that
at
least
the
woman
was
speaking
the
truth
for
there
was
no
light
in
either
of
the
front
rooms
the
grand
it
was
there
that
widdup
had
seen
them
he
walked
to
sackville
row
at
a
great
pace
and
straight
into
the
hotel
where
waiters
and
elderly
commercial
gentlemen
stared
at
his
wet
clothes
and
his
haggard
face
he
went
into
each
of
the
and
down
the
stairs
to
the
turkish
lounge
nowhere
was
rosie
or
griffin
to
be
seen
a
search
of
this
kind
was
ridiculous
but
every
moment
that
the
agony
was
extended
made
him
more
desperately
anxious
he
walked
back
in
the
drizzle
to
prince
place
and
paced
the
pavement
under
the
black
walls
of
the
warehouses
the
road
was
deserted
there
was
no
sound
in
it
at
all
but
the
dripping
of
water
from
some
neglected
spout
he
walked
up
and
down
in
the
shadow
and
as
he
walked
he
became
conscious
of
something
like
a
personality
in
the
faces
of
the
long
row
of
something
sinister
as
though
their
shuttered
windows
concealed
a
wealth
of
obscene
experience
like
the
eyes
of
ancient
the
souls
of
those
squat
victorian
houses
were
languidly
interested
in
him
another
that
was
what
he
must
seem
to
them
and
still
the
windows
of
number
ten
were
unlighted
he
heard
the
clock
in
the
art
gallery
chime
eleven
a
leisurely
placid
chime
muffled
by
gusty
rain
perhaps
the
woman
had
lied
to
him
perhaps
at
that
very
moment
rosie
was
sleeping
peacefully
in
the
unlighted
upper
story
he
was
overwrought
with
the
strain
of
the
examination
on
the
top
of
this
devastating
passion
he
had
better
go
home
he
turned
to
go
and
at
that
very
moment
he
saw
two
figures
approaching
from
the
halesby
road
the
street
lamp
at
the
corner
threw
their
shadows
on
the
shining
pavement
one
of
them
was
would
have
known
her
the
other
beyond
doubt
was
griffin
he
was
seized
with
the
same
blind
passion
that
had
swept
over
him
in
the
big
schoolroom
at
ten
years
before
an
impulse
to
murder
that
he
could
only
control
by
digging
his
finger
nails
into
his
hands
he
stood
there
trembling
in
the
shadow
of
the
blank
wall
huddling
close
to
it
for
support
and
for
protection
they
passed
him
and
he
heard
quiet
laugh
her
laugh
was
one
of
the
things
about
her
that
he
had
loved
most
they
stopped
at
the
door
and
rosie
took
out
her
latchkey
it
was
almost
a
repetition
of
the
scene
in
which
he
had
shared
a
week
before
now
perhaps
she
would
kiss
him
he
felt
that
if
he
saw
her
kissing
griffin
he
could
have
killed
them
both
cross
a
hundred
thoughts
came
swirling
through
his
brain
they
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
griffin
the
old
griffin
the
human
beast
of
the
new
griffin
the
gross
north
bromwich
womaniser
the
griffin
of
edwin
saw
himself
upon
the
edge
of
a
ghastly
unthinkable
tragedy
he
must
prevent
it
at
all
costs
at
the
cost
of
life
if
needs
be
he
crept
quickly
across
the
road
the
houses
watched
him
the
window
of
the
lower
room
bloomed
suddenly
with
a
yellow
light
he
stood
with
his
hands
clutching
the
listening
once
again
he
heard
laugh
and
a
rumour
of
deeper
speech
that
he
knew
to
be
the
voice
of
griffin
the
shadow
of
shoulders
swept
the
window
swelling
gigantically
as
it
passed
the
light
was
turned
down
but
not
extinguished
laugh
again
he
could
have
killed
her
for
that
laugh
for
it
mocked
him
the
faint
shadow
of
the
shoulders
retreated
he
guessed
that
they
were
standing
at
the
door
the
door
of
the
room
closed
softly
now
there
was
no
sound
except
the
heavy
breathing
that
one
hears
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
pigsty
at
night
was
griffin
still
there
another
beam
of
light
fell
on
the
shining
street
some
one
had
lighted
the
gas
in
the
room
upstairs
was
griffin
still
below
panic
seized
him
he
must
know
at
all
costs
he
must
know
if
he
had
to
break
in
the
front
door
he
must
know
as
he
reached
it
he
tripped
over
an
iron
the
step
barked
his
shin
of
course
the
door
was
locked
of
had
left
the
latchkey
outside
he
opened
the
door
softly
and
went
on
into
the
hall
in
the
room
on
the
right
he
still
heard
the
grunting
noise
thank
god
griffin
was
still
there
at
least
he
could
tell
him
that
he
knew
he
opened
the
door
in
the
he
could
see
that
the
room
was
empty
except
for
beaucaire
who
lay
stretched
on
the
sofa
snoring
heavily
with
her
vile
mouth
open
on
the
table
stood
an
empty
brandy
bottle
the
place
stank
of
brandy
now
he
knew
the
worst
he
stumbled
upstairs
in
the
dark
and
knocked
frantically
at
the
door
of
the
front
bedroom
rosie
answered
is
it
i
for
sake
let
me
the
devil
is
it
said
the
voice
of
rosie
answered
him
in
excited
whispers
come
in
eddie
she
said
on
earth
did
you
get
into
the
house
please

see

i
coming

i
tell
you

the
door

i

the
voice
muttered
the
devil
has
ingleby
to
do
with
you
all
right
go
chuck
the
fellow
please
let
him
go
griffin
unlocked
the
door
he
stood
facing
edwin
in
his
rosie
still
dressed
clutched
at
the
mantelpiece
the
vein
in
the
middle
of
forehead
bulged
with
anger
his
short
neck
was
flushed
the
he
then
they
closed
heel
ripped
up
the
corner
of
the
carpet
as
they
swayed
together
suddenly
grip
slackened
his
face
blanched
and
in
a
moment
edwin
was
letting
down
a
sheer
weight
upon
the
bed
the
matter
rosie
screamed
and
flung
herself
beside
him
the
matter
god
she
cried
edwin
tore
open
shirt
listening
for
an
impulse
that
was
not
there
gone
he
said
panting
he
always
had
a
rocky
heart
the
awful
word
seemed
to
pull
rosie
together
they
stared
at
each
other
blankly
with
wide
eyes
you
sure
she
whispered
of
she
rose
to
her
feet
speaking
in
a
voice
that
was
quite
new
to
him
for
sake
go
now
quickly
quickly
i
tell
you
be
a
damned
little
fool
you
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
eddie
for
causes
he
blundered
down
the
dark
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
he
could
not
walk
he
cowered
under
the
warehouse
wall
opposite
gazing
as
though
fascinated
at
the
yellow
square
of
window
the
discreet
victorian
houses
surveyed
him
as
if
the
horror
that
the
yellow
blind
concealed
were
an
ordinary
occurrence
in
their
dingy
lives
they
were
used
to
death
and
death
did
not
change
them
a
hansom
rolled
smoothly
up
the
halesby
road
past
the
mouth
of
the
place
at
the
corner
under
the
edwin
saw
the
figure
of
a
policeman
with
rain
shining
on
his
cape
the
sight
recalled
him
to
a
sense
of
awful
possibilities
for
the
moment
he
dared
not
move
he
flattened
himself
against
the
warehouse
walls
and
did
not
realise
that
he
was
standing
directly
under
the
dripping
waterspout
in
the
western
sky
rose
the
baleful
glare
of
an
uncowled
furnace
the
policeman
strolled
away
and
edwin
cautiously
emerging
set
off
through
the
rain
up
the
halesby
road
towards
the
hills
he
felt
that
he
needed
their
solitude
and
darkness
iv
next
day
a
haggard
and
desolate
figure
he
appeared
in
the
of
the
university
where
the
examination
results
were
displayed
in
a
dream
he
realised
that
he
was
now
a
bachelor
of
medicine
but
in
the
realisation
there
was
none
of
the
joy
that
he
had
anticipated
he
stood
before
the
board
bewildered
until
came
up
behind
him
and
wrung
his
hand
look
as
if
been
making
a
night
of
it
my
boy
he
said
and
have
some
coffee
at
the
was
on
the
top
of
himself
was
a
pretty
near
thing
the
external
examiner
in
medicine
gave
me
hell
but
all
right
god
difficult
to
believe
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
know
a
voyage
i
should
he
thought
of
it
before
not
a
bad
idea
bit
of
a
rest
cure
eh
the
only
disadvantage
i
mind
telling
you
of
being
married
i
leave
the
babbled
on
happily
you
see
the
evening
paper
he
said
see
that
fellow
done
for
i
always
said
come
to
a
nasty
sticky
end
some
woman
or
i
remember
your
saying
that
he
play
footer
because
of
his
heart
ah
well
one
swine
the
less
poor
devil
when
left
him
edwin
called
for
a
timetable
and
looked
out
the
trains
to
liverpool
there
was
one
that
started
in
half
an
hour
he
caught
it
and
next
morning
presented
himself
at
a
shipping
office
in
water
street
the
medical
superintendent
received
him
want
a
ship
well
you
know
you
look
very
young
when
were
you
qualified
edwin
confessed
young
still
you
be
stale
you
by
any
chance
practically
a
total
the
man
scrutinised
haggard
eyes
well
as
it
happens
one
of
our
men
has
failed
us
give
you
a
ship
the
if
you
can
sail
rather
short
notice
eh
think
i
can
do
it
what
about
equipment
we
go
in
for
uniforms
on
our
ships
ten
pounds
a
month
and
bonus
what
is
she
going
to
you
may
call
at
japan
for
coal
with
luck
see
the
world
you
know
what
most
of
you
fellows
are
after
have
to
go
aboard
birkenhead
he
and
with
trembling
hands
he
signed
his
contract
in
a
wintry
evening
he
crossed
the
mersey
ferry
a
salt
wind
from
the
west
boomed
up
the
channel
edwin
in
the
bows
felt
his
face
drenched
with
spray
clean
he
thought
will
make
me
cleaner
what
i
need
i
believe
i
shall
ever
feel
anything
again
until
washed
clean
old
old
and
numb
lost
my
sense
of
enjoyment
i
wonder
if
it
will
ever
come
back
to
me
as
he
stood
there
in
the
salt
breeze
some
words
of
traherne
his
countryman
came
into
his
mind
shall
never
enjoy
this
world
aright
till
the
sea
itself
floweth
in
your
veins
till
you
are
clothed
with
the
heavens
and
crowned
with
the
perhaps
they
were
true
he
wondered
