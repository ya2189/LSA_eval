the

in
a
beautiful
and
retired
part
of
england
lived
villars
a
lady
whose
accurate
understanding
benevolent
heart
and
steady
temper
peculiarly
fitted
her
for
the
most
difficult
as
well
as
most
important
of
all
occupations
the
education
of
youth
this
task
she
had
undertaken
and
twenty
young
persons
were
put
under
her
care
with
the
perfect
confidence
of
their
parents
no
young
people
could
be
happier
they
were
good
and
gay
emulous
but
not
envious
of
each
other
for
villars
was
impartially
just
her
praise
they
felt
to
be
the
reward
of
merit
and
her
blame
they
knew
to
be
the
necessary
consequence
of
ill
conduct
to
the
one
therefore
they
patiently
submitted
and
in
the
other
consciously
rejoiced
they
rose
with
fresh
cheerfulness
in
the
morning
eager
to
pursue
their
various
occupations
they
returned
in
the
evening
with
renewed
ardour
to
their
amusements
and
retired
to
rest
satisfied
with
themselves
and
pleased
with
each
other
nothing
so
much
contributed
to
preserve
a
spirit
of
emulation
in
this
little
society
as
a
small
honorary
distinction
given
annually
as
the
prize
of
successful
application
the
prize
this
year
was
peculiarly
dear
to
each
individual
as
it
was
the
picture
of
a
friend
whom
they
all
dearly
loved
it
was
the
picture
of
villars
in
a
small
bracelet
it
wanted
neither
gold
pearls
nor
precious
stones
to
give
it
value
the
two
foremost
candidates
for
the
prize
were
cecilia
and
leonora
cecilia
was
the
most
intimate
friend
of
leonora
but
leonora
was
only
the
favourite
companion
of
cecilia
cecilia
was
of
an
active
ambitious
enterprising
disposition
more
eager
in
the
pursuit
than
happy
in
the
enjoyment
of
her
wishes
leonora
was
of
a
contented
unaspiring
temperate
character
not
easily
roused
to
action
but
indefatigable
when
once
excited
leonora
was
proud
cecilia
was
vain
her
vanity
made
her
more
dependent
upon
the
approbation
of
others
and
therefore
more
anxious
to
please
than
leonora
but
that
very
vanity
made
her
at
the
same
time
more
apt
to
offend
in
short
leonora
was
the
most
anxious
to
avoid
what
was
wrong
cecilia
the
most
ambitious
to
do
what
was
right
few
of
their
companions
loved
but
many
were
led
by
cecilia
for
she
was
often
successful
many
loved
leonora
but
none
were
ever
governed
by
her
for
she
was
too
indolent
to
govern
on
the
first
day
of
may
about
six
in
the
evening
a
great
bell
rang
to
summon
this
little
society
into
a
hall
where
the
prize
was
to
be
decided
a
number
of
small
tables
were
placed
in
a
circle
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
seats
for
the
young
competitors
were
raised
one
above
another
in
a
semicircle
some
yards
distant
from
the
table
and
the
judges
chairs
under
canopies
of
lilacs
and
luburnums
forming
another
semicircle
closed
the
amphitheatre
every
one
put
their
writings
their
drawings
their
works
of
various
kinds
upon
the
tables
appropriated
for
each
how
unsteady
were
the
last
steps
to
these
tables
how
each
little
hand
trembled
as
it
laid
down
its
claims
till
this
moment
every
one
thought
herself
secure
of
success
but
now
each
felt
an
equal
certainty
of
being
excelled
and
the
heart
which
a
few
minutes
before
exulted
with
hope
now
palpitated
with
fear
the
works
were
examined
the
preference
adjudged
and
the
prize
was
declared
to
be
the
happy
cecilia
villars
came
forward
smiling
with
the
bracelet
in
her
hand
cecilia
was
behind
her
companions
on
the
highest
row
all
the
others
gave
way
and
she
was
on
the
floor
in
an
instant
villars
clasped
the
bracelet
on
her
arm
the
clasp
was
heard
through
the
whole
hall
and
a
universal
smile
of
congratulation
followed
villars
kissed
cecilia
little
hand
and
now
said
she
go
and
rejoice
with
your
companions
the
remainder
of
the
day
is
yours
oh
you
whose
hearts
are
elated
with
success
whose
bosoms
beat
high
with
joy
in
the
moment
of
triumph
command
yourselves
let
that
triumph
be
moderate
that
it
may
be
lasting
consider
that
though
you
are
good
you
may
be
better
and
though
wise
you
may
be
weak
as
soon
as
villars
had
given
her
the
bracelet
all
cecilia
little
companions
crowded
round
her
and
they
all
left
the
hall
in
an
instant
she
was
full
of
spirits
and
vanity
she
ran
on
running
down
the
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
garden
in
her
violent
haste
cecilia
threw
down
the
little
louisa
louisa
had
a
china
mandarin
in
her
hand
which
her
mother
had
sent
her
that
very
morning
it
was
all
broke
to
pieces
by
the
fall
oh
my
mandarin
cried
louisa
bursting
into
tears
the
crowd
behind
cecilia
suddenly
stopped
louisa
sat
on
the
lowest
step
fixing
her
eyes
upon
the
broken
pieces
then
turning
round
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
upon
the
step
above
her
in
turning
louisa
threw
down
the
remains
of
the
mandarin
the
head
which
she
had
placed
in
the
socket
fell
from
the
shoulders
and
rolled
bounding
along
the
cecilia
pointed
to
the
head
and
to
the
socket
and
burst
out
laughing
the
crowd
behind
laughed
too
at
any
other
time
they
would
have
been
more
inclined
to
cry
with
louisa
but
cecilia
had
just
been
successful
and
sympathy
with
the
victorious
often
makes
us
forget
justice
leonora
however
preserved
her
usual
consistency
poor
louisa
said
she
looking
first
at
her
and
then
reproachfully
at
cecilia
cecilia
turned
sharply
round
colouring
half
with
shame
and
half
with
vexation
i
could
not
help
it
leonora
said
she
but
you
could
have
helped
laughing
cecilia
i
did
laugh
at
louisa
and
i
surely
may
laugh
for
it
does
nobody
any
harm
i
am
sure
however
replied
leonora
i
should
not
have
laughed
if
i
had
no
to
be
sure
you
would
because
louisa
is
your
favourite
i
can
buy
her
another
mandarin
the
next
time
that
old
pedlar
comes
to
the
door
if
that
all
i
do
no
more
i
said
she
turning
round
to
her
companions
no
to
be
sure
said
they
that
all
fair
cecilia
looked
triumphantly
at
leonora
leonora
let
go
her
hand
she
ran
on
and
the
crowd
followed
when
she
got
to
the
end
of
the
garden
she
turned
round
to
see
if
leonora
had
followed
her
too
but
was
vexed
to
see
her
still
sitting
on
the
steps
with
louisa
i
sure
i
can
do
no
more
than
buy
her
another
i
said
she
again
appealing
to
her
companions
no
to
be
sure
said
they
eager
to
begin
their
plays
how
many
did
they
begin
and
leave
off
before
cecilia
could
be
satisfied
with
any
her
thoughts
were
discomposed
and
her
mind
was
running
upon
something
else
no
wonder
then
that
she
did
not
play
with
her
usual
address
she
grew
still
more
impatient
she
threw
down
the
come
let
us
play
at
something
else
at
threading
the
needle
said
she
holding
out
her
hand
they
all
yielded
to
the
hand
which
wore
the
bracelet
but
cecilia
dissatisfied
with
herself
was
discontented
with
everybody
else
her
tone
grew
more
and
more
peremptory
one
was
too
rude
another
too
stiff
one
was
too
slow
another
too
quick
in
short
everything
went
wrong
and
everybody
was
tired
of
her
humours
the
triumph
of
is
absolute
but
short
cecilia
companions
at
length
recollected
that
though
she
had
embroidered
a
tulip
and
painted
a
peach
better
than
they
yet
that
they
could
play
as
well
and
keep
their
tempers
better
she
was
thrown
out
walking
towards
the
house
in
a
peevish
mood
she
met
leonora
she
passed
on
cecilia
cried
leonora
well
what
do
you
want
with
me
are
we
friends
you
know
best
we
are
if
you
will
let
me
tell
louisa
that
you
are
sorry
cecilia
interrupting
her
o
pray
let
me
hear
no
more
about
louisa
what
not
confess
that
you
were
in
the
wrong
oh
cecilia
i
had
a
better
opinion
of
you
your
opinion
is
of
no
consequence
to
me
now
for
you
do
love
me
no
not
when
you
are
unjust
cecilia
unjust
i
am
not
unjust
and
if
i
were
you
are
not
my
governess
no
but
am
i
not
your
friend
i
do
desire
to
have
such
a
friend
who
would
quarrel
with
me
for
happening
to
throw
down
little
louisa
how
could
i
tell
that
she
had
a
mandarin
in
her
hand
and
when
it
was
broken
could
i
do
more
than
promise
her
another
was
that
unjust
but
you
know
cecilia
ironically
i
know
leonora
that
you
love
louisa
better
than
you
do
me
that
the
injustice
if
i
did
replied
leonora
gravely
it
would
be
no
injustice
if
she
deserved
it
better
how
can
you
compare
louisa
to
me
exclaimed
cecilia
indignantly
leonora
made
no
answer
for
she
was
really
hurt
at
her
friend
conduct
she
walked
on
to
join
the
rest
of
her
companions
they
were
dancing
in
a
round
upon
the
grass
leonora
declined
dancing
but
they
prevailed
upon
her
to
sing
for
them
her
voice
was
not
so
sprightly
but
it
was
sweeter
than
usual
who
sung
so
sweetly
as
leonora
or
who
danced
so
nimbly
as
louisa
away
she
was
flying
all
spirits
and
gayety
when
leonora
eyes
full
of
tears
caught
hers
louisa
silently
let
go
her
companions
hands
and
quitting
the
dance
ran
up
to
leonora
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
with
her
nothing
replied
she
that
need
interrupt
you
go
my
dear
and
dance
again
louisa
immediately
ran
away
to
her
garden
and
pulling
off
her
little
straw
hat
she
lined
it
with
the
freshest
strawberry
leaves
and
was
upon
her
knees
before
the
strawberry
bed
when
cecilia
came
by
cecilia
was
not
disposed
to
be
pleased
with
louisa
at
that
instant
for
two
reasons
because
she
was
jealous
of
her
and
because
she
had
injured
her
the
injury
however
louisa
had
already
forgotten
perhaps
to
tell
things
just
as
they
were
she
was
not
quite
so
much
inclined
to
kiss
cecilia
as
she
would
have
been
before
the
fall
of
her
mandarin
but
this
was
the
utmost
extent
of
her
malice
if
it
can
be
called
malice
what
are
you
doing
there
little
one
said
cecilia
in
a
sharp
tone
are
you
eating
your
early
strawberries
here
all
alone
no
said
louisa
mysteriously
i
am
not
eating
them
what
are
you
doing
with
them
ca
you
answer
then
i
not
playing
with
you
child
oh
as
to
that
cecilia
you
know
i
need
not
answer
you
unless
i
choose
it
not
but
what
i
would
if
you
would
only
ask
me
civilly
and
if
you
would
not
call
me
why
should
not
i
call
you
child
because
because
i
do
know
but
i
wish
you
would
stand
out
of
my
light
cecilia
for
you
are
trampling
upon
all
my
strawberries
i
have
not
touched
one
you
covetous
little
creature
indeed
indeed
cecilia
i
am
not
covetous
i
have
not
eaten
one
of
them
they
are
all
for
your
friend
leonora
see
how
unjust
you
are
unjust
that
a
cant
word
you
learned
of
my
friend
leonora
as
you
call
her
but
she
is
not
my
friend
now
not
your
friend
now
exclaimed
louisa
then
i
am
sure
you
must
have
done
something
naughty
how
said
cecilia
catching
hold
of
her
let
me
go
let
me
go
cried
louisa
struggling
i
wo
give
you
one
of
my
strawberries
for
i
do
like
you
at
all
you
do
do
you
said
cecilia
provoked
and
catching
the
hat
from
louisa
she
flung
the
strawberries
over
the
hedge
will
nobody
help
me
exclaimed
louisa
snatching
her
hat
again
and
running
away
with
all
her
force
what
have
i
done
said
cecilia
recollecting
herself
louisa
louisa
she
called
very
loud
but
louisa
would
not
turn
back
she
was
running
to
her
companions
they
were
still
dancing
hand
in
hand
upon
the
grass
whilst
leonora
sitting
in
the
middle
sang
to
them
stop
stop
and
hear
me
cried
louisa
breaking
through
them
and
rushing
up
to
leonora
she
threw
her
hat
at
her
feet
and
panting
for
breath
it
was
full
almost
full
of
my
own
strawberries
said
she
the
first
i
ever
got
out
of
my
own
garden
they
should
all
have
been
for
you
leonora
but
now
i
have
not
one
left
they
are
all
gone
said
she
and
she
hid
her
face
in
leonora
lap
gone
gone
where
said
every
one
at
once
running
up
to
her
cecilia
cecilia
said
she
sobbing
cecilia
repeated
leonora
what
of
cecilia
yes
it
was
it
was
come
along
with
me
said
leonora
unwilling
to
have
her
friend
exposed
come
and
i
will
get
you
some
more
strawberries
oh
i
mind
the
strawberries
indeed
but
i
wanted
to
have
had
the
pleasure
of
giving
them
to
you
leonora
took
her
up
in
her
arms
to
carry
her
away
but
it
was
too
late
what
cecilia
cecilia
who
won
the
prize
it
could
not
surely
be
cecilia
whispered
every
busy
tongue
at
this
instant
the
bell
summoned
them
in
there
she
is
there
she
is
cried
they
pointing
to
an
arbour
where
cecilia
was
standing
ashamed
and
alone
and
as
they
passed
her
some
lifted
up
their
hands
and
eyes
with
astonishment
others
whispered
and
huddled
mysteriously
together
as
if
to
avoid
her
leonora
walked
on
her
head
a
little
higher
than
usual
leonora
said
cecilia
timorously
as
she
passed
oh
cecilia
who
would
have
thought
that
you
had
a
bad
heart
cecilia
turned
her
head
aside
and
burst
into
tears
oh
no
indeed
she
has
not
a
bad
heart
cried
louisa
running
up
to
her
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
neck
she
very
sorry
are
not
you
cecilia
but
do
cry
any
more
for
i
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
and
i
love
you
now
though
i
said
i
did
not
when
i
was
in
a
passion
o
you
girl
how
i
love
you
said
cecilia
kissing
her
well
then
if
you
do
come
along
with
me
and
dry
your
eyes
for
they
are
so
red
go
my
dear
and
i
come
presently
then
i
will
keep
a
place
for
you
next
to
me
but
you
must
make
haste
or
you
will
have
to
come
in
when
we
have
all
set
down
to
supper
and
then
you
will
be
so
stared
at
so
do
stay
now
cecilia
followed
louisa
with
her
eyes
till
she
was
out
of
sight
and
is
louisa
said
she
to
herself
the
only
one
who
would
stop
to
pity
me
villars
told
me
that
this
day
should
be
mine
she
little
thought
how
it
would
end
saying
these
words
cecilia
threw
herself
down
upon
the
ground
her
arm
leaned
upon
a
heap
of
turf
which
she
had
raised
in
the
morning
and
which
in
the
pride
and
gayety
of
her
heart
she
had
called
her
throne
at
this
instant
villars
came
out
to
enjoy
the
serenity
of
the
evening
and
passing
by
the
arbour
where
cecilia
lay
she
started
cecilia
rose
hastily
who
is
there
said
villars
it
is
i
madam
and
who
is
i
cecilia
why
what
keeps
you
here
my
dear
where
are
your
companions
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
happiest
days
of
your
life
o
no
madam
said
cecilia
hardly
able
to
repress
her
tears
why
my
dear
what
is
the
matter
cecilia
hesitated
speak
my
dear
you
know
that
when
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
any
thing
as
your
friend
i
never
punish
you
as
your
governess
therefore
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
no
madam
i
am
not
afraid
but
ashamed
you
asked
me
why
i
was
not
with
my
companions
why
madam
because
they
have
all
left
me
and
and
what
my
dear
and
i
see
that
they
all
dislike
me
and
yet
i
do
know
why
they
should
for
i
take
as
much
pains
to
please
as
any
of
them
all
my
masters
seem
satisfied
with
me
and
you
yourself
were
pleased
this
very
morning
to
give
me
this
bracelet
and
i
am
sure
you
would
not
have
given
it
to
any
one
who
did
not
deserve
it
certainly
not
you
did
deserve
it
for
your
application
for
your
successful
application
the
prize
was
for
the
most
assiduous
not
for
the
most
amiable
then
if
it
had
been
for
the
most
amiable
it
would
not
have
been
for
me
villars
smiling
why
what
do
you
think
yourself
cecilia
you
are
better
able
to
judge
than
i
am
i
can
determine
whether
or
no
you
apply
to
what
i
give
you
to
learn
whether
you
attend
to
what
i
desire
you
to
do
and
avoid
what
i
desire
you
not
to
do
i
know
that
i
like
you
as
a
pupil
but
i
can
not
know
that
i
should
like
you
as
a
companion
unless
i
were
your
companion
therefore
i
must
judge
of
what
i
should
do
by
seeing
what
others
do
in
the
same
circumstances
o
pray
do
for
then
you
would
not
love
me
neither
and
yet
i
think
you
would
love
me
for
i
hope
that
i
am
as
ready
to
oblige
and
as
as
yes
cecilia
i
do
doubt
but
that
you
would
be
very
to
me
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
should
not
like
you
unless
you
were
too
but
by
i
mean
it
all
the
same
thing
no
indeed
i
understand
by
them
two
very
different
things
you
are
cecilia
for
you
are
desirous
to
oblige
and
serve
your
companions
to
gain
them
praise
and
save
them
from
blame
to
give
them
pleasure
and
to
relieve
them
from
pain
but
leonora
is
for
she
can
bear
with
their
foibles
and
acknowledge
her
own
without
disputing
about
the
right
she
sometimes
yields
to
those
who
are
in
the
wrong
in
short
her
temper
is
perfectly
good
for
it
can
bear
and
forbear
i
wish
that
mine
could
said
cecilia
sighing
it
may
replied
villars
but
it
is
not
wishes
alone
which
can
improve
us
in
any
thing
turn
the
same
exertion
and
perseverance
which
have
won
you
the
prize
to
this
object
and
you
will
meet
with
the
same
success
perhaps
not
on
the
first
the
second
or
the
third
attempt
but
depend
upon
it
that
you
will
at
last
every
new
effort
will
weaken
your
bad
habits
and
strengthen
your
good
ones
but
you
must
not
expect
to
succeed
all
at
once
i
repeat
it
to
you
for
habit
must
be
counteracted
by
habit
it
would
be
as
extravagant
in
us
to
expect
that
all
our
faults
could
be
destroyed
by
one
punishment
were
it
ever
so
severe
as
it
was
in
the
roman
emperor
we
were
reading
of
a
few
days
ago
to
wish
that
all
the
heads
of
his
enemies
were
upon
one
neck
that
he
might
cut
them
off
by
one
blow
here
villars
took
cecilia
by
the
hand
and
they
began
to
walk
home
such
was
the
nature
of
cecilia
mind
that
when
any
object
was
forcibly
impressed
on
her
imagination
it
caused
a
temporary
suspension
of
her
reasoning
faculties
hope
was
too
strong
a
stimulus
for
her
spirits
and
when
fear
did
take
possession
of
her
mind
it
was
attended
with
total
debility
her
vanity
was
now
as
much
mortified
as
in
the
morning
it
had
been
elated
she
walked
on
with
villars
in
silence
until
they
came
under
the
shade
of
the
walk
and
then
fixing
her
eyes
upon
villars
she
stopped
short
do
you
think
madam
said
she
with
hesitation
do
you
think
madam
that
i
have
a
bad
heart
a
bad
heart
my
dear
why
what
put
that
into
your
head
leonora
said
that
i
had
and
i
felt
ashamed
when
she
said
so
but
my
dear
how
can
leonora
tell
whether
your
heart
be
good
or
bad
however
in
the
first
place
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
a
bad
heart
indeed
i
do
not
know
what
is
meant
by
it
but
it
is
something
which
every
body
hates
and
why
do
they
hate
it
because
they
think
that
it
will
hurt
them
i
believe
and
that
those
who
have
bad
hearts
take
delight
in
doing
mischief
and
that
they
never
do
any
body
good
but
for
their
own
ends
then
the
best
definition
which
you
can
give
me
of
a
bad
heart
is
that
it
is
some
constant
propensity
to
hurt
others
and
to
do
wrong
for
the
sake
of
doing
wrong
yes
but
that
is
not
all
neither
there
is
still
something
else
meant
something
which
i
can
not
express
which
indeed
i
never
distinctly
understood
but
of
which
therefore
i
was
the
more
afraid
well
then
to
begin
with
what
you
do
understand
tell
me
cecilia
do
you
really
think
it
possible
to
be
wicked
merely
for
the
love
of
wickedness
no
human
being
becomes
wicked
all
at
once
a
man
begins
by
doing
wrong
because
it
is
or
because
he
thinks
it
is
for
his
interest
if
he
continue
to
do
so
he
must
conquer
his
sense
of
shame
and
lose
his
love
of
virtue
but
how
can
you
cecilia
who
feel
such
a
strong
sense
of
shame
and
such
an
eager
desire
to
improve
imagine
that
you
have
a
bad
heart
indeed
madam
i
never
did
until
every
body
told
me
so
and
then
i
began
to
be
frightened
about
it
this
very
evening
when
i
was
in
a
passion
i
threw
little
louisa
strawberries
away
which
i
am
sure
i
was
very
sorry
for
afterwards
and
leonora
and
every
body
cried
out
that
i
had
a
bad
heart
but
i
am
sure
that
i
was
only
in
a
passion
very
likely
and
when
you
are
in
a
passion
as
you
call
it
cecilia
you
see
that
you
are
tempted
to
do
harm
to
others
if
they
do
not
feel
angry
themselves
they
do
not
sympathize
with
you
they
do
not
perceive
the
motive
which
actuates
you
and
then
they
say
that
you
have
a
bad
heart
i
dare
say
however
when
your
passion
is
over
and
when
you
recollect
yourself
you
are
very
sorry
for
what
you
have
done
and
said
are
not
you
yes
indeed
madam
very
sorry
then
make
that
sorrow
of
use
to
you
cecilia
and
fix
it
steadily
in
your
thoughts
as
you
hope
to
be
good
and
happy
that
if
you
suffer
yourself
to
yield
to
your
passion
upon
every
trifling
occasion
anger
and
its
consequences
will
become
familiar
to
your
mind
and
in
the
same
proportion
your
sense
of
shame
will
be
weakened
till
what
you
began
with
doing
from
sudden
impulse
you
will
end
with
doing
from
habit
and
choice
and
then
you
would
indeed
according
to
our
definition
have
a
bad
heart
oh
madam
i
hope
i
am
sure
i
never
shall
no
indeed
cecilia
i
do
indeed
believe
that
you
never
will
on
the
contrary
i
think
that
you
have
a
very
good
disposition
and
what
is
of
infinitely
more
consequence
to
you
an
active
desire
of
improvement
show
me
that
you
have
as
much
perseverance
as
you
have
candour
and
i
shall
not
despair
of
your
becoming
every
thing
that
i
could
wish
here
cecilia
countenance
brightened
and
she
ran
up
the
steps
in
almost
as
high
spirits
as
she
ran
down
them
in
the
morning
good
night
to
you
cecilia
said
villars
as
she
was
crossing
the
hall
good
night
to
you
madam
said
cecilia
and
she
ran
up
stairs
to
bed
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
but
she
lay
awake
reflecting
upon
the
events
of
the
preceding
day
and
forming
resolutions
for
the
future
at
the
same
time
considering
that
she
had
resolved
and
resolved
without
effect
she
wished
to
give
her
mind
some
more
powerful
motive
ambition
she
knew
to
be
its
most
powerful
incentive
have
i
not
said
she
to
herself
already
won
the
prize
of
application
and
can
not
the
same
application
procure
me
a
much
higher
prize
villars
said
that
if
the
prize
had
been
promised
to
the
most
amiable
it
would
not
have
been
given
to
me
perhaps
it
would
not
yesterday
perhaps
it
might
not
but
that
is
no
reason
that
i
should
despair
of
ever
deserving
it
in
consequence
of
this
reasoning
cecilia
formed
a
design
of
proposing
to
her
companions
that
they
should
give
a
prize
the
first
of
the
ensuing
month
the
first
of
june
to
the
most
amiable
villars
applauded
the
scheme
and
her
companions
adopted
it
with
the
greatest
alacrity
let
the
prize
said
they
be
a
bracelet
of
our
own
hair
and
instantly
their
shining
scissors
were
procured
and
each
contributed
a
lock
of
her
hair
they
formed
the
most
beautiful
gradation
of
colours
from
the
palest
auburn
to
the
brightest
black
who
was
to
have
the
honour
of
plaiting
them
was
now
the
question
caroline
begged
that
she
might
as
she
could
plait
very
neatly
she
said
cecilia
however
was
equally
sure
that
she
could
do
it
much
better
and
a
dispute
would
inevitably
have
ensued
if
cecilia
recollecting
herself
just
as
her
colour
rose
to
scarlet
had
not
yielded
yielded
with
no
very
good
grace
indeed
but
as
well
as
could
be
expected
for
the
first
time
for
it
is
habit
which
confers
ease
and
without
ease
even
in
moral
actions
there
can
be
no
grace
the
bracelet
was
plaited
in
the
neatest
manner
by
caroline
finished
round
the
edge
with
silver
twist
and
on
it
was
worked
in
the
smallest
silver
letters
this
motto
to
the
most
amiable
the
moment
it
was
completed
every
body
begged
to
try
it
on
it
fastened
with
little
silver
clasps
and
as
it
was
made
large
enough
for
the
eldest
girls
it
was
too
large
for
the
youngest
of
this
they
bitterly
complained
and
unanimously
entreated
that
it
might
be
cut
to
fit
them
how
foolish
exclaimed
cecilia
do
you
perceive
that
if
you
win
it
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
put
the
clasps
a
little
further
from
the
edge
but
if
we
get
it
we
ca
make
it
larger
very
true
said
they
but
you
need
not
to
have
called
us
foolish
cecilia
it
was
by
such
hasty
and
unguarded
expressions
as
these
that
cecilia
offended
a
slight
difference
in
the
manner
makes
a
very
material
one
in
the
effect
cecilia
lost
more
love
by
general
petulance
than
she
could
gain
by
the
greatest
particular
exertions
how
far
she
succeeded
in
curing
herself
of
this
defect
how
far
she
became
deserving
of
the
bracelet
and
to
whom
the
bracelet
was
given
shall
be
told
in
the
history
of
the
first
of
june
continuation
of
the
bracelets
the
first
of
june
was
now
arrived
and
all
the
young
competitors
were
in
a
state
of
the
most
anxious
suspense
leonora
and
cecilia
continued
to
be
the
foremost
candidates
their
quarrel
had
never
been
finally
adjusted
and
their
different
pretensions
now
retarded
all
thoughts
of
a
reconciliation
cecilia
though
she
was
capable
of
acknowledging
any
of
her
faults
in
public
before
all
her
companions
could
not
humble
herself
in
private
to
leonora
leonora
was
her
equal
they
were
her
inferiors
and
submission
is
much
easier
to
a
vain
mind
where
it
appears
to
be
voluntary
than
when
it
is
the
necessary
tribute
to
justice
or
candour
so
strongly
did
cecilia
feel
this
truth
that
she
even
delayed
making
any
apology
or
coming
to
any
explanation
with
leonora
until
success
should
once
more
give
her
the
palm
if
i
win
the
bracelet
said
she
to
herself
i
will
solicit
the
return
of
leonora
friendship
it
will
be
more
valuable
to
me
than
even
the
bracelet
and
at
such
a
time
and
asked
in
such
a
manner
she
surely
can
not
refuse
it
to
me
animated
with
this
hope
of
a
double
triumph
cecilia
canvassed
with
the
most
zealous
activity
by
constant
attention
and
exertion
she
had
considerably
abated
the
violence
of
her
temper
and
changed
the
course
of
her
habits
her
powers
of
pleasing
were
now
excited
instead
of
her
abilities
to
excel
and
if
her
talents
appeared
less
brilliant
her
character
was
acknowledged
to
be
more
amiable
so
great
an
influence
upon
our
manners
and
conduct
have
the
objects
of
our
ambition
cecilia
was
now
if
possible
more
than
ever
desirous
of
doing
what
was
right
but
she
had
not
yet
acquired
sufficient
fear
of
doing
wrong
this
was
the
fundamental
error
of
her
mind
it
arose
in
a
great
measure
from
her
early
education
her
mother
died
when
she
was
very
young
and
though
her
father
had
supplied
her
place
in
the
best
and
kindest
manner
he
had
insensibly
infused
into
his
daughter
mind
a
portion
of
that
enterprising
independent
spirit
which
he
justly
deemed
essential
to
the
character
of
her
brother
this
brother
was
some
years
older
than
cecilia
but
he
had
always
been
the
favourite
companion
of
her
youth
what
her
precepts
inculcated
his
example
enforced
and
even
cecilia
virtues
consequently
became
such
as
were
more
estimable
in
a
man
than
desirable
in
a
female
all
small
objects
and
small
errors
she
had
been
taught
to
disregard
as
trifles
and
her
impatient
disposition
was
perpetually
leading
her
into
more
material
faults
yet
her
candour
in
confessing
these
she
had
been
suffered
to
believe
was
sufficient
reparation
and
atonement
leonora
on
the
contrary
who
had
been
educated
by
her
mother
in
a
manner
more
suited
to
her
sex
had
a
character
and
virtues
more
peculiar
to
a
female
her
judgment
had
been
early
cultivated
and
her
good
sense
employed
in
the
regulation
of
her
conduct
she
had
been
habituated
to
that
restraint
which
as
a
woman
she
was
to
expect
in
life
and
early
accustomed
to
yield
compliance
in
her
seemed
natural
and
graceful
yet
notwithstanding
the
gentleness
of
her
temper
she
was
in
reality
more
independent
than
cecilia
she
had
more
reliance
upon
her
own
judgment
and
more
satisfaction
in
her
own
approbation
though
far
from
insensible
to
praise
she
was
not
liable
to
be
misled
by
the
indiscriminate
love
of
admiration
the
uniform
kindness
of
her
manner
the
consistency
and
equality
of
her
character
had
fixed
the
esteem
and
passive
love
of
her
companions
by
passive
love
we
mean
that
species
of
affection
which
makes
us
unwilling
to
offend
rather
than
anxious
to
oblige
which
is
more
a
habit
than
an
emotion
of
the
mind
for
cecilia
her
companions
felt
active
love
for
she
was
active
in
showing
her
love
to
them
active
love
arises
spontaneously
in
the
mind
after
feeling
particular
instances
of
kindness
without
reflection
on
the
past
conduct
or
general
character
it
exceeds
the
merits
of
its
object
and
is
connected
with
a
feeling
of
generosity
rather
than
with
a
sense
of
justice
without
determining
which
species
of
love
is
the
more
flattering
to
others
we
can
easily
decide
which
is
the
most
agreeable
feeling
to
our
own
minds
we
give
our
hearts
more
credit
for
being
generous
than
for
being
just
and
we
feel
more
when
we
give
our
love
voluntarily
than
when
we
yield
it
as
a
tribute
which
we
can
not
withhold
though
cecilia
companions
might
not
know
all
this
in
theory
they
proved
it
in
practice
for
they
loved
her
in
a
much
higher
proportion
to
her
merits
than
they
loved
leonora
each
of
the
young
judges
were
to
signify
their
choice
by
putting
a
red
or
a
white
shell
into
a
vase
prepared
for
the
purpose
cecilia
colour
was
red
leonora
white
in
the
morning
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
these
shells
nothing
talked
of
but
the
event
of
the
evening
cecilia
following
leonora
example
had
made
it
a
point
of
honour
not
to
inquire
of
any
individual
her
vote
previous
to
their
final
determination
they
were
both
sitting
together
in
louisa
room
louisa
was
recovering
from
the
measles
every
one
during
her
illness
had
been
desirous
of
attending
her
but
leonora
and
cecilia
were
the
only
two
that
were
permitted
to
see
her
as
they
alone
had
had
the
distemper
they
were
both
assiduous
in
their
care
of
louisa
but
leonora
want
of
exertion
to
overcome
any
disagreeable
feelings
of
sensibility
often
deprived
her
of
presence
of
mind
and
prevented
her
being
so
constantly
useful
as
cecilia
cecilia
on
the
contrary
often
made
too
much
noise
and
bustle
with
her
officious
assistance
and
was
too
anxious
to
invent
amusements
and
procure
comforts
for
louisa
without
perceiving
that
illness
takes
away
the
power
of
enjoying
them
as
she
was
sitting
in
the
window
in
the
morning
exerting
herself
to
entertain
louisa
she
heard
the
voice
of
an
old
pedlar
who
often
used
to
come
to
the
house
down
stairs
she
ran
immediately
to
ask
permission
to
bring
him
into
the
hall
villars
consented
and
away
cecilia
ran
to
proclaim
the
news
to
her
companions
then
first
returning
into
the
hall
she
found
the
pedlar
just
unbuckling
his
box
and
taking
it
off
his
shoulders
what
would
you
be
pleased
to
want
miss
said
he
i
all
kinds
of
rings
and
lockets
of
all
sorts
continued
he
opening
all
the
glittering
drawers
successively
oh
said
cecilia
shutting
the
drawer
of
lockets
which
tempted
her
most
these
are
not
the
things
which
i
want
have
you
any
china
figures
any
mandarins
miss
i
had
a
great
stock
of
that
same
china
ware
but
now
i
quite
out
of
them
kind
of
things
but
i
believe
said
he
rummaging
in
one
of
the
deepest
drawers
i
believe
i
have
one
left
and
here
it
is
oh
that
is
the
very
thing
what
its
price
only
three
shillings
cecilia
paid
the
money
and
was
just
going
to
carry
off
the
mandarin
when
the
pedlar
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
neat
mahogany
case
it
was
about
a
foot
long
and
fastened
at
each
end
by
two
little
clasps
it
had
besides
a
small
lock
in
the
middle
what
is
that
said
cecilia
eagerly
it
only
a
china
figure
miss
which
i
am
going
to
carry
to
an
elderly
lady
who
lives
nigh
at
hand
and
who
is
mighty
fond
of
such
things
could
you
let
me
look
at
it
and
welcome
miss
said
he
and
opened
the
case
o
goodness
how
beautiful
exclaimed
cecilia
it
was
a
figure
of
flora
crowned
with
roses
and
carrying
a
basket
of
flowers
in
her
hand
cecilia
contemplated
it
with
delight
how
i
should
like
to
give
this
to
louisa
said
she
to
herself
and
at
last
breaking
silence
did
you
promise
it
to
the
old
lady
o
no
miss
i
did
promise
it
she
never
saw
it
and
if
so
be
that
you
like
to
take
it
i
make
no
more
words
about
it
and
how
much
does
it
cost
why
miss
as
to
that
i
let
you
have
it
for
illustration
cecilia
immediately
produced
the
box
in
which
she
kept
her
treasure
and
emptying
it
upon
the
table
she
began
to
count
the
shillings
alas
there
were
but
six
shillings
how
provoking
said
she
then
i
have
it
where
the
mandarin
o
i
have
it
said
she
taking
it
up
and
looking
at
it
with
the
utmost
disgust
is
this
the
same
that
i
had
before
yes
miss
the
very
same
replied
the
pedlar
who
during
this
time
had
been
examining
the
little
box
out
of
which
cecilia
had
taken
her
money
it
was
of
silver
why
said
he
since
you
taken
such
a
fancy
to
the
piece
if
you
a
mind
to
make
up
the
remainder
of
the
money
i
will
take
this
here
little
box
if
you
care
to
part
with
it
now
this
box
was
a
keepsake
from
leonora
to
cecilia
no
said
cecilia
hastily
blushing
a
little
and
stretching
out
her
hand
to
receive
it
oh
miss
said
he
returning
it
carelessly
i
hope
there
no
offence
i
meant
but
to
serve
you
that
all
such
a
rare
piece
of
has
no
cause
to
go
a
begging
added
he
putting
the
flora
deliberately
into
the
case
then
turning
the
key
with
a
jerk
he
let
it
drop
into
his
pocket
and
lifting
up
his
box
by
the
leather
straps
he
was
preparing
to
depart
oh
stay
one
minute
said
cecilia
in
whose
mind
there
had
passed
a
very
warm
conflict
during
the
pedlar
harangue
louisa
would
so
like
this
flora
said
she
arguing
with
herself
besides
it
would
be
so
generous
in
me
to
give
it
to
her
instead
of
that
ugly
mandarin
that
would
be
doing
only
common
justice
for
i
promised
it
to
her
and
she
expects
it
though
when
i
come
to
look
at
this
mandarin
it
is
not
even
so
good
as
hers
was
the
gilding
is
all
rubbed
off
so
that
i
absolutely
must
buy
this
for
her
o
yes
i
will
and
she
will
be
so
delighted
and
then
every
body
will
say
it
is
the
prettiest
thing
they
ever
saw
and
the
broken
mandarin
will
be
forgotten
forever
here
cecilia
hand
moved
and
she
was
just
going
to
decide
o
but
stop
said
she
to
herself
consider
leonora
gave
me
this
box
and
it
is
a
keepsake
however
now
we
have
quarreled
and
i
dare
say
that
she
would
not
mind
my
parting
with
it
i
sure
that
i
should
not
care
if
she
was
to
give
away
my
keepsake
the
smelling
bottle
or
the
ring
which
i
gave
her
so
what
does
it
signify
besides
is
it
not
my
own
and
have
i
not
a
right
to
do
what
i
please
with
it
at
this
dangerous
instant
for
cecilia
a
party
of
her
companions
opened
the
door
she
knew
that
they
came
as
purchasers
and
she
dreaded
her
flora
becoming
the
prize
of
some
higher
bidder
here
said
she
hastily
putting
the
box
into
the
pedlar
hand
without
looking
at
it
take
it
and
give
me
the
flora
her
hand
trembled
though
she
snatched
it
impatiently
she
ran
by
without
seeming
to
mind
any
of
her
companions
she
almost
wished
to
turn
back
let
those
who
are
tempted
to
do
wrong
by
the
hopes
of
future
gratification
or
the
prospect
of
certain
concealment
and
impunity
remember
that
unless
they
are
totally
depraved
they
bear
in
their
own
hearts
a
monitor
who
will
prevent
their
enjoying
what
they
have
ill
obtained
in
vain
cecilia
ran
to
the
rest
of
her
companions
to
display
her
present
in
hopes
that
the
applause
of
others
would
restore
her
own
in
vain
she
saw
the
flora
pass
in
due
pomp
from
hand
to
hand
each
viewing
with
the
other
in
extolling
the
beauty
of
the
gift
and
the
generosity
of
the
giver
cecilia
was
still
displeased
with
herself
with
them
and
even
with
their
praise
from
louisa
gratitude
however
she
yet
expected
much
pleasure
and
immediately
she
ran
up
stairs
to
her
room
in
the
mean
time
leonora
had
gone
into
the
hall
to
buy
a
bodkin
she
had
just
broken
hers
in
giving
her
change
the
pedlar
took
out
of
his
pocket
with
some
the
very
box
which
cecilia
had
sold
him
leonora
did
not
in
the
least
suspect
the
truth
for
her
mind
was
above
suspicion
and
besides
she
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
cecilia
i
should
like
to
have
that
box
said
she
for
it
is
like
one
of
which
i
was
very
fond
the
pedlar
named
the
price
and
leonora
took
the
box
she
intended
to
give
it
to
little
louisa
on
going
to
her
room
she
found
her
asleep
and
she
sat
down
softly
by
her
louisa
opened
her
eyes
i
hope
i
did
disturb
you
said
leonora
o
no
i
did
hear
you
come
in
but
what
have
you
got
there
it
is
only
a
little
box
would
you
like
to
have
it
i
bought
it
on
purpose
for
you
as
i
thought
perhaps
it
would
please
you
because
like
that
which
i
gave
cecilia
o
yes
that
out
of
which
she
used
to
give
me
barbary
drops
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
always
thought
exceedingly
pretty
and
this
indeed
is
as
like
it
as
possible
i
ca
unscrew
it
will
you
try
leonora
unscrewed
it
goodness
exclaimed
louisa
this
must
be
cecilia
box
look
you
see
a
great
l
at
the
bottom
of
it
leonora
colour
changed
yes
she
replied
calmly
i
see
that
but
it
is
no
proof
that
it
is
cecilia
you
know
that
i
bought
this
box
just
now
of
the
pedlar
that
may
be
said
louisa
but
i
remember
scratching
that
l
with
my
own
needle
and
cecilia
scolded
me
for
it
too
do
go
and
ask
her
if
she
has
lost
her
box
do
repeated
louisa
pulling
her
by
the
sleeve
as
she
did
not
seem
to
listen
leonora
indeed
did
not
hear
for
she
was
lost
in
thought
she
was
comparing
circumstances
which
had
before
escaped
her
attention
she
recollected
that
cecilia
had
passed
her
as
she
came
into
the
hall
without
seeming
to
see
her
but
had
blushed
as
she
passed
she
remembered
that
the
pedlar
appeared
unwilling
to
part
with
the
box
and
was
going
to
put
it
again
into
his
pocket
with
the
and
why
should
he
keep
it
in
his
pocket
and
not
show
it
with
his
other
things
combining
all
these
circumstances
leonora
had
no
longer
any
doubt
of
the
truth
for
though
she
had
honourable
confidence
in
her
friends
she
had
too
much
penetration
to
be
implicitly
credulous
louisa
she
began
but
at
this
instant
she
heard
a
step
which
by
its
quickness
she
knew
to
be
cecilia
coming
along
the
passage
if
you
love
me
louisa
said
leonora
say
nothing
about
the
box
nay
but
why
not
i
dare
say
she
has
lost
it
no
my
dear
i
am
afraid
she
has
not
louisa
looked
surprised
but
i
have
reasons
for
desiring
you
not
to
say
any
thing
about
it
well
then
i
wo
indeed
cecilia
opened
the
door
came
forward
smiling
as
if
secure
of
a
good
reception
and
taking
the
flora
out
of
the
case
she
placed
it
on
the
opposite
to
louisa
bed
dear
how
beautiful
cried
louisa
starting
up
yes
said
cecilia
and
guess
who
it
for
for
me
perhaps
said
the
ingenuous
louisa
yes
take
it
and
keep
it
for
my
sake
you
know
that
i
broke
your
mandarin
o
but
this
is
a
great
deal
prettier
and
larger
than
that
yes
i
know
it
is
and
i
meant
that
it
should
be
so
i
should
only
have
done
what
i
was
bound
to
do
if
i
had
only
given
you
a
mandarin
well
and
that
would
have
been
enough
surely
but
what
a
beautiful
crown
of
roses
and
then
that
basket
of
flowers
they
almost
look
as
if
i
could
smell
them
dear
cecilia
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
wo
take
it
by
way
of
payment
for
the
mandarin
you
broke
for
i
sure
you
could
not
help
that
and
besides
i
should
have
broken
it
myself
by
this
time
you
shall
give
it
to
me
entirely
and
i
keep
it
as
long
as
i
live
as
your
keepsake
louisa
stopped
short
and
coloured
the
word
keepsake
recalled
the
box
to
her
mind
and
all
the
train
of
ideas
which
the
flora
had
banished
but
said
she
looking
up
wishfully
in
cecilia
face
and
holding
the
flora
doubtfully
did
you
leonora
who
was
just
quitting
the
room
turned
her
head
back
and
gave
louisa
a
look
which
silenced
her
cecilia
was
so
infatuated
with
her
vanity
that
she
neither
perceived
leonora
sign
nor
louisa
confusion
but
continued
showing
off
her
present
by
placing
it
in
various
situations
till
at
length
she
put
it
into
the
case
and
laying
it
down
with
an
affected
carelessness
upon
the
bed
i
must
go
now
louisa
good
bye
said
she
running
up
and
kissing
her
but
i
come
again
presently
then
clapping
the
door
after
her
she
went
but
as
soon
as
the
fermentation
of
her
spirits
subsided
the
sense
of
shame
which
had
been
scarcely
felt
when
mixed
with
so
many
other
sensations
rose
uppermost
in
her
mind
what
said
she
to
herself
is
it
possible
that
i
have
sold
what
i
promised
to
keep
for
ever
and
what
leonora
gave
me
and
i
have
concealed
it
too
and
have
been
making
a
parade
of
my
generosity
o
what
would
leonora
what
would
louisa
what
would
every
body
think
of
me
if
the
truth
were
known
humiliated
and
grieved
by
these
reflections
cecilia
began
to
search
in
her
own
mind
for
some
consoling
idea
she
began
to
compare
her
conduct
with
the
conduct
of
others
of
her
own
age
and
at
length
fixing
her
comparison
upon
her
brother
george
as
the
companion
of
whom
from
her
infancy
she
had
been
habitually
the
most
emulous
she
recollected
that
an
almost
similar
circumstance
had
once
happened
to
him
and
that
he
had
not
only
escaped
disgrace
but
had
acquired
glory
by
an
intrepid
confession
of
his
fault
her
father
words
to
her
brother
on
that
occasion
she
also
perfectly
recollected
come
to
me
george
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
you
are
a
generous
brave
boy
they
who
dare
to
confess
their
faults
will
make
great
and
good
men
these
were
his
words
but
cecilia
in
repeating
them
to
herself
forgot
to
lay
that
emphasis
on
the
word
which
would
have
placed
it
in
contradistinction
to
the
word
women
she
willingly
believed
that
the
observation
extended
equally
to
both
sexes
and
flattered
herself
that
she
should
exceed
her
brother
in
merit
if
she
owned
a
fault
which
she
thought
that
it
would
be
so
much
more
difficult
to
confess
yes
but
said
she
stopping
herself
how
can
i
confess
it
this
very
evening
in
a
few
hours
the
prize
will
be
decided
leonora
or
i
shall
win
it
i
have
now
as
good
a
chance
as
leonora
perhaps
a
better
and
must
i
give
up
all
my
hopes
all
that
i
have
been
labouring
for
this
month
past
o
i
never
can
if
it
were
or
yesterday
or
any
day
but
this
i
would
not
hesitate
but
now
i
am
almost
certain
of
the
prize
and
if
i
win
it
well
why
then
i
will
i
think
i
will
tell
all
yes
i
will
i
am
determined
said
cecilia
here
a
bell
summoned
them
to
dinner
leonora
sat
opposite
to
her
and
she
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
cecilia
look
so
gay
and
unrestrained
surely
said
she
to
herself
if
cecilia
had
done
this
that
i
suspect
she
would
not
she
could
not
look
as
she
does
but
leonora
little
knew
the
cause
of
her
gayety
cecilia
was
never
in
higher
spirits
or
better
pleased
with
herself
than
when
she
had
resolved
upon
a
sacrifice
or
a
confession
must
not
this
evening
be
given
to
the
most
amiable
whose
then
will
it
be
all
eyes
glanced
first
at
cecilia
and
then
at
leonora
cecilia
smiled
leonora
blushed
i
see
that
it
is
not
yet
decided
said
villars
and
immediately
they
ran
up
stairs
amidst
confused
whisperings
cecilia
voice
could
be
distinguished
far
above
the
rest
how
can
she
be
so
happy
said
leonora
to
herself
o
cecilia
there
was
a
time
when
you
could
not
have
neglected
me
so
when
we
were
always
together
the
best
of
friends
and
companions
our
wishes
tastes
and
pleasures
the
same
surely
she
did
once
love
me
said
leonora
but
now
she
is
quite
changed
she
has
even
sold
my
keepsake
and
would
rather
win
a
bracelet
of
hair
from
girls
whom
she
did
not
always
think
so
much
superior
to
leonora
than
have
my
esteem
my
confidence
and
my
friendship
for
her
whole
life
yes
for
her
whole
life
for
i
am
sure
she
will
be
an
amiable
woman
oh
that
this
bracelet
had
never
been
thought
of
or
that
i
was
certain
of
her
winning
it
for
i
am
certain
that
i
do
not
wish
to
win
it
from
her
i
would
rather
a
thousand
times
rather
that
we
were
as
we
used
to
be
than
have
all
the
glory
in
the
world
and
how
pleasing
cecilia
can
be
when
she
wishes
to
please
how
candid
she
is
how
much
she
can
improve
herself
let
me
be
just
though
she
has
offended
me
she
is
wonderfully
improved
within
this
last
month
for
one
fault
and
against
myself
should
i
forget
all
her
merits
as
leonora
said
these
last
words
she
could
but
just
hear
the
voices
of
her
companions
they
had
left
her
alone
in
the
gallery
she
knocked
softly
at
louisa
door
come
in
said
louisa
i
in
not
asleep
oh
said
she
starting
up
with
the
flora
in
her
hand
the
instant
that
the
door
was
opened
i
so
glad
you
are
come
leonora
for
i
did
so
long
to
hear
what
you
were
all
making
such
a
noise
about
have
you
forgot
that
the
bracelet
o
yes
is
this
the
evening
well
here
my
white
shell
for
you
i
kept
it
in
my
pocket
this
fortnight
and
though
cecilia
did
give
me
this
flora
i
still
love
you
a
great
deal
better
i
thank
you
louisa
said
leonora
gratefully
i
will
take
your
shell
and
i
shall
value
it
as
long
as
i
live
but
here
is
a
red
one
and
if
you
wish
to
show
me
that
you
love
me
you
will
give
this
to
cecilia
i
know
that
she
is
particularly
anxious
for
your
preference
and
i
am
sure
that
she
deserves
it
yes
if
i
could
i
would
choose
both
of
you
but
you
know
i
can
only
choose
which
i
like
the
best
if
you
mean
my
dear
louisa
said
leonora
that
you
like
me
the
best
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
indeed
i
wish
you
to
love
me
but
it
is
enough
for
me
to
know
it
in
private
i
should
not
feel
the
least
more
pleasure
at
hearing
it
in
public
or
in
having
it
made
known
to
all
my
companions
especially
at
a
time
when
it
would
give
poor
cecilia
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
why
should
it
give
her
pain
i
do
like
her
for
being
jealous
of
you
nay
louisa
surely
you
do
think
cecilia
jealous
she
only
tries
to
excel
and
to
please
she
is
more
anxious
to
succeed
than
i
am
it
is
true
because
she
has
a
great
deal
more
activity
and
perhaps
more
ambition
and
it
would
really
mortify
her
to
lose
this
prize
you
know
that
she
proposed
it
herself
it
has
been
her
object
for
this
month
past
and
i
am
sure
she
has
taken
great
pains
to
obtain
it
but
dear
leonora
why
should
you
lose
it
indeed
my
dear
it
would
be
no
loss
to
me
and
if
it
were
i
would
willingly
suffer
it
for
cecilia
for
though
we
seem
not
to
be
such
good
friends
as
we
used
to
be
i
love
her
very
much
and
she
will
love
me
again
i
sure
she
will
when
she
no
longer
fears
me
as
a
rival
she
will
again
love
me
as
a
friend
here
leonora
heard
a
number
of
her
companions
running
along
the
gallery
they
all
knocked
hastily
at
the
door
calling
leonora
leonora
will
you
never
come
cecilia
has
been
with
us
this
half
hour
leonora
smiled
well
louisa
said
she
smiling
will
you
promise
me
o
i
sure
by
the
way
they
speak
to
you
that
they
wo
give
you
the
prize
said
the
little
louisa
and
the
tears
started
into
her
eyes
they
love
me
though
for
all
that
and
as
for
the
prize
you
know
whom
i
wish
to
have
it
leonora
leonora
called
her
impatient
companions
do
you
hear
us
what
are
you
about
o
she
never
will
take
any
trouble
about
any
thing
said
one
of
the
party
let
go
away
o
go
go
make
haste
cried
louisa
do
stay
they
are
so
angry
i
will
i
will
indeed
remember
then
that
you
have
promised
me
said
leonora
and
she
left
the
room
during
all
this
time
cecilia
had
been
in
the
garden
with
her
companions
the
ambition
which
she
had
felt
to
win
the
first
prize
the
prize
of
superior
talents
and
superior
application
was
not
to
be
compared
to
the
absolute
anxiety
which
she
now
expressed
to
win
this
simple
testimony
of
the
love
and
approbation
of
her
equals
and
rivals
to
employ
her
exuberant
activity
she
had
been
dragging
branches
of
lilacs
and
laburnums
roses
and
to
ornament
the
bower
in
which
her
fate
was
to
be
decided
it
was
excessively
hot
but
her
mind
was
engaged
and
she
was
indefatigable
she
stood
still
at
last
to
admire
her
works
her
companions
all
joined
in
loud
applause
they
were
not
a
little
prejudiced
in
her
favour
by
the
great
eagerness
which
she
expressed
to
win
their
prize
and
by
the
great
importance
which
she
seemed
to
affix
to
the
preference
of
each
individual
at
last
where
is
leonora
cried
one
of
them
and
immediately
as
we
have
seen
they
ran
to
call
her
cecilia
was
left
alone
overcome
with
heat
and
too
violent
exertion
she
had
hardly
strength
to
support
herself
each
moment
appeared
to
her
intolerably
long
she
was
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
suspense
and
all
her
courage
failed
her
even
hope
forsook
her
and
hope
is
a
cordial
which
leaves
the
mind
depressed
and
enfeebled
the
time
is
now
come
said
cecilia
in
a
few
moments
it
will
be
decided
in
a
few
moments
goodness
how
much
i
do
hazard
if
i
should
not
win
the
prize
how
shall
i
confess
what
i
have
done
how
shall
i
beg
leonora
to
forgive
me
i
who
hoped
to
restore
my
friendship
to
her
as
an
honour
they
are
gone
to
seek
for
her
the
moment
she
appears
i
shall
be
forgotten
what
shall
what
shall
i
do
said
cecilia
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
such
was
her
situation
when
leonora
accompanied
by
her
companions
opened
the
they
most
of
them
ran
forward
to
cecilia
as
leonora
came
into
the
bower
she
held
out
her
hand
to
cecilia
we
are
not
rivals
but
friends
i
hope
said
she
cecilia
clasped
her
hand
but
she
was
in
too
great
agitation
to
speak
the
table
was
now
set
in
the
arbour
the
vase
was
now
placed
in
the
middle
well
said
cecilia
eagerly
who
begins
caroline
one
of
her
friends
came
forward
first
and
then
all
the
others
successively
cecilia
emotion
was
hardly
now
they
are
all
in
count
them
caroline
one
two
three
four
the
numbers
are
both
equal
there
was
a
dead
silence
no
they
are
not
exclaimed
cecilia
pressing
forward
and
putting
a
shell
into
the
vase
i
have
not
given
mine
and
i
give
it
to
leonora
then
snatching
the
bracelet
it
is
yours
leonora
said
she
take
it
and
give
me
back
your
friendship
the
whole
assembly
gave
a
universal
clap
and
shout
of
applause
i
can
not
be
surprised
at
this
from
you
cecilia
said
leonora
and
do
you
then
still
love
me
as
you
used
to
do
o
leonora
stop
do
praise
me
i
do
deserve
this
said
she
turning
to
her
loudly
applauding
companions
you
will
soon
despise
me
o
leonora
you
will
never
forgive
me
i
have
deceived
you
i
have
sold
at
this
instant
villars
appeared
the
crowd
divided
she
had
heard
all
that
passed
from
her
window
i
applaud
your
generosity
cecilia
said
she
but
i
am
to
tell
you
that
in
this
instance
it
is
unsuccessful
you
have
it
not
in
your
power
to
give
the
prize
to
leonora
it
is
yours
i
have
another
vote
to
give
you
you
have
forgotten
louisa
louisa
but
surely
louisa
loves
leonora
better
than
she
does
me
she
commissioned
me
however
said
villars
to
give
you
a
red
shell
and
you
will
find
it
in
this
box
cecilia
started
and
turned
as
pale
as
death
it
was
the
fatal
box
villars
produced
another
box
she
opened
it
it
contained
the
flora
and
louisa
also
desired
me
said
she
to
return
you
this
flora
she
put
it
into
cecilia
hand
cecilia
trembled
so
that
she
could
not
hold
it
leonora
caught
it
o
madam
o
leonora
exclaimed
cecilia
now
i
have
no
hope
left
i
intended
i
was
just
going
to
tell
dear
cecilia
said
leonora
you
need
not
tell
it
me
i
know
it
already
and
i
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
yes
i
can
prove
to
you
said
villars
that
leonora
has
forgiven
you
it
is
she
who
has
given
you
the
prize
it
was
she
who
persuaded
louisa
to
give
you
her
vote
i
went
to
see
her
a
little
while
ago
and
perceiving
by
her
countenance
that
something
was
the
matter
i
pressed
her
to
tell
me
what
it
was
madam
said
she
has
made
me
promise
to
give
my
shell
to
cecilia
now
i
do
love
cecilia
half
so
well
as
i
do
leonora
besides
i
would
not
have
cecilia
think
i
vote
for
her
because
she
gave
me
a
flora
whilst
louisa
was
speaking
continued
villars
i
saw
the
silver
box
lying
on
the
bed
i
took
it
up
and
asked
if
it
was
not
yours
and
how
she
came
by
it
madam
said
louisa
could
have
been
almost
certain
that
it
was
cecilia
but
leonora
gave
it
me
and
she
said
that
she
bought
it
of
the
pedlar
this
morning
if
any
body
else
had
told
me
so
i
could
not
have
believed
them
because
i
remembered
the
box
so
well
but
i
ca
help
believing
leonora
did
you
not
ask
cecilia
about
it
said
i
madam
replied
louisa
leonora
forbade
me
i
guessed
her
reason
said
i
me
the
box
and
i
will
carry
your
shell
in
it
to
cecilia
madam
said
she
i
must
give
it
her
pray
do
take
the
flora
and
return
it
to
her
first
that
she
may
not
think
it
is
for
that
i
do
it
o
generous
leonora
exclaimed
cecilia
but
indeed
louisa
i
can
not
take
your
shell
then
dear
cecilia
accept
of
mine
instead
of
it
you
can
not
refuse
it
i
only
follow
your
example
as
for
the
bracelet
added
leonora
taking
cecilia
hand
i
assure
you
i
do
wish
for
it
and
you
do
and
you
deserve
it
no
said
cecilia
indeed
i
do
not
deserve
it
next
to
you
surely
louisa
deserves
it
best
louisa
o
yes
louisa
exclaimed
every
body
with
one
voice
yes
said
villars
and
let
cecilia
carry
the
bracelet
to
her
she
deserves
that
reward
for
one
fault
i
can
not
forget
all
your
merits
cecilia
nor
i
am
sure
will
your
companions
then
surely
not
your
best
friend
said
leonora
kissing
her
every
body
present
was
moved
they
looked
up
to
leonora
with
respectful
and
affectionate
admiration
o
leonora
how
i
love
you
and
how
i
wish
to
be
like
you
exclaimed
cecilia
to
be
as
good
as
generous
rather
wish
cecilia
interrupted

be
as
just
to
be
as
strictly
