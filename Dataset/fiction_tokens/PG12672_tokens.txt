the

a

in
the
sun
i
the
fire
was
kind
the
little
house
was
waiting
as
it
had
waited
for
many
years
grey
and
it
leaned
toward
the
sheltering
hillside
as
though
to
gather
from
the
kindly
earth
some
support
and
comfort
for
old
age
winters
had
broken
its
spirit
springs
had
not
brought
back
the
heart
of
it
that
had
once
gone
out
with
dancing
feet
and
singing
and
had
returned
no
more
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
garden
had
lain
desolate
summers
came
and
went
but
only
a
few
straggling
blooms
made
their
way
above
the
mass
of
weeds
in
early
autumn
thistles
and
milkweed
took
possession
of
the
place
the
mournful
purple
of
their
flowering
hiding
the
garden
beneath
trappings
of
woe
and
at
night
when
the
autumn
moon
shone
dimly
frail
ghosts
of
dead
flowers
were
set
free
from
the
thistles
and
milkweed
the
wind
of
indian
summer
itself
a
ghost
convoyed
them
about
the
garden
but
they
never
went
beyond
it
each
year
the
panoply
of
purple
spread
farther
more
surely
hiding
the
brave
blooms
beneath
far
down
the
path
beside
the
broken
gate
a
majestic
cypress
cast
portentous
gloom
across
from
it
and
quite
hiding
the
ruin
of
the
gate
was
a
which
every
june
put
forth
one
perfect
white
rose
love
had
come
through
the
gate
and
love
had
gone
out
again
but
this
one
flower
was
left
behind
brambles
grew
about
the
doorstep
and
the
hinges
of
the
door
were
deep
in
rust
no
friendly
light
gleamed
at
night
from
the
lattice
a
beacon
to
the
wayfarer
or
a
message
of
cheer
to
the
disheartened
since
the
little
house
was
alone
the
secret
spinners
had
hung
a
drapery
of
cobwebs
before
the
desolate
windows
as
though
to
veil
the
loneliness
from
no
fire
warmed
the
solitary
hearth
no
gay
and
careless
laughter
betrayed
the
sleeping
echoes
into
answer
within
the
house
were
only
dreams
which
never
had
come
true
a
bit
of
sewing
yet
lay
upon
the
table
in
the
and
an
embroidery
frame
holding
still
a
square
of
fine
linen
had
fallen
from
a
chair
an
open
book
was
propped
against
the
back
of
the
chair
and
a
low
rocker
facing
it
was
swerved
sharply
aside
the
evidence
of
daily
occupation
suddenly
interrupted
was
all
there
a
quiet
content
overlaid
by
a
dumb
creeping
paralysis
the
march
wind
blew
fiercely
through
the
night
and
the
little
house
leaned
yet
more
toward
the
sheltering
hill
afar
in
the
village
a
train
rumbled
into
the
station
the
midnight
train
from
the
city
by
which
the
people
of
rushton
regulated
their
watches
and
clocks
strangely
enough
it
stopped
and
more
than
one
good
man
turning
uneasily
upon
his
pillow
wondered
if
the
world
might
have
come
to
its
end
half
an
hour
afterward
a
lone
figure
ascended
the
steep
road
which
led
to
the
house
a
woman
fearless
of
the
night
because
life
had
already
done
its
worst
to
her
stumbled
up
the
stony
overgrown
way
the
moon
shone
fitfully
among
the
flying
clouds
and
she
guided
herself
by
its
uncertain
gleams
pausing
now
and
then
in
complete
darkness
to
wait
for
more
light
a
long
white
chiffon
veil
trailed
behind
her
too
securely
fastened
to
her
hat
to
be
blown
away
even
in
the
night
she
watched
furtively
and
listened
for
approaching
footsteps
one
hand
holding
the
end
of
her
veil
in
such
a
way
that
she
might
quickly
hide
her
face
outside
the
gate
she
paused
irresolute
at
the
last
moment
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
never
enter
the
house
again
a
light
snow
had
fallen
upon
the
dead
garden
covering
its
scarred
face
with
white
miss
evelina
noted
quickly
that
her
garden
too
was
hidden
as
by
chiffon
a
gust
of
wind
made
her
shiver
or
was
it
the
veiled
garden
nerving
herself
to
her
necessity
she
took
up
her
satchel
and
went
up
the
path
as
one
might
walk
with
bared
feet
up
a
ladder
of
swords
each
step
that
took
her
nearer
the
house
hurt
her
the
more
but
she
was
not
of
those
who
cry
out
when
hurt
she
set
her
lips
more
firmly
together
and
continued
upon
her
way
when
she
reached
the
house
she
already
had
the
key
in
her
uncertain
fingers
the
rusty
lock
yielded
at
length
and
the
door
opened
noisily
her
heart
surged
painfully
as
she
entered
the
musty
darkness
it
was
so
that
miss
evelina
came
home
after
years
the
thousand
noises
of
an
empty
house
greeted
her
discordantly
a
rattling
window
was
answered
by
a
creaking
stair
a
rafter
groaned
dismally
and
the
scurrying
feet
of
mice
pattered
across
a
distant
floor
fumbling
in
her
satchel
miss
evelina
drew
out
a
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
presently
there
was
light
in
the
little
house
a
faint
glimmering
light
which
flickered
when
the
wind
shook
the
walls
and
twinkled
again
bravely
when
it
ceased
she
took
off
her
wraps
and
through
force
of
habit
pinned
the
multitudinous
folds
of
her
veil
to
her
hair
forgetting
that
at
midnight
and
in
her
own
house
there
were
none
to
see
her
face
then
she
made
a
fire
for
the
body
must
be
warmed
though
the
heart
is
dead
and
the
soul
stricken
dumb
she
had
brought
with
her
a
box
containing
a
small
canister
of
tea
and
she
soon
had
ready
a
cup
of
it
so
strong
that
it
was
bitter
with
her
feet
upon
the
hearth
and
the
single
candle
flickering
upon
the
mantel
shelf
she
sat
in
the
lonely
house
and
sipped
her
tea
her
black
gown
clung
closely
to
her
figure
and
the
white
chiffon
veil
thrown
back
did
not
wholly
hide
her
abundant
hair
the
horror
of
one
night
had
whitened
miss
evelina
brown
hair
at
twenty
for
the
sorrows
of
youth
are
unmercifully
keen
i
have
come
back
she
thought
i
have
come
back
through
that
door
i
went
out
of
it
laughing
at
twenty
at
i
have
come
back
and
i
have
lived
why
did
i
not
die
she
questioned
for
the
thousandth
time
if
there
had
been
a
god
in
heaven
surely
i
must
have
died
the
flames
leaped
merrily
in
the
fireplace
and
the
discordant
noises
of
the
house
resolved
themselves
into
vague
harmony
a
cricket
safely
ensconced
for
the
winter
in
a
crevice
of
the
hearth
awoke
in
the
unaccustomed
warmth
piping
a
shrill
and
cheery
welcome
but
miss
evelina
sat
abstractedly
staring
into
the
fire
after
all
there
had
never
been
anything
but
happiness
in
the
house
the
misery
had
been
outside
peace
and
quiet
content
had
dwelt
there
securely
but
the
memory
of
it
brought
no
balm
now
as
though
it
were
yesterday
the
black
walnut
chair
covered
with
haircloth
stood
primly
against
the
wall
miss
evelina
had
always
hated
the
chair
and
here
after
years
it
confronted
her
again
she
mused
ironically
upon
the
permanence
of
things
usually
considered
transient
and
temporary
her
mother
sewing
was
still
upon
the
table
but
the
hands
that
held
it
were
long
since
mingled
with
the
dust
her
own
embroidery
had
apparently
but
just
fallen
from
the
chair
and
the
dream
that
had
led
to
its
fashioning
was
only
a
dream
from
which
she
awoke
to
enduring
agony
with
swift
hatred
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
embroidery
frame
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
time
as
time
had
ceased
to
exist
for
her
she
suffered
until
suffering
brought
its
own
far
anodyne
the
inability
to
sustain
it
further
then
she
slept
from
sheer
weariness
before
dawn
usually
she
awoke
sufficiently
rested
to
suffer
again
when
she
felt
faint
she
ate
scarcely
knowing
what
she
ate
for
food
was
as
dust
and
ashes
in
her
mouth
in
the
bag
that
hung
from
her
belt
was
a
vial
of
laudanum
renewed
from
time
to
time
as
she
feared
its
strength
was
waning
she
had
been
taught
that
it
was
wicked
to
take
one
own
life
and
that
god
was
always
kind
not
having
experienced
the
kindness
she
began
to
doubt
the
existence
of
god
and
was
immediately
face
to
face
with
the
idea
that
it
could
not
be
wrong
to
die
if
one
was
too
miserable
to
live
her
mind
revolved
perpetually
in
this
circle
and
came
continually
back
to
a
compromise
she
would
live
one
more
day
and
then
she
would
free
herself
there
was
always
a
when
she
should
be
free
but
it
never
came
the
fire
died
down
and
the
candle
had
but
a
few
minutes
more
to
burn
it
was
the
hour
of
the
night
when
life
is
at
its
lowest
when
souls
pass
out
into
the
great
beyond
miss
evelina
took
the
vial
from
her
reticule
and
uncorked
it
the
bitter
pungent
odour
came
as
sweet
incense
to
her
nostrils
no
one
knew
she
had
come
no
one
would
ever
enter
her
door
again
she
might
die
peacefully
in
her
own
house
and
no
one
would
know
until
the
walls
crumbled
to
dust
perhaps
not
even
then
and
miss
evelina
had
a
horror
of
a
grave
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
the
bitterness
the
silken
leaves
of
the
poppies
flowers
of
sleep
had
been
crushed
into
this
the
lees
must
be
drained
from
the
cup
of
life
before
the
cup
could
be
set
aside
every
one
came
to
this
sooner
or
later
why
not
choose
why
not
drain
the
cup
now
when
it
had
all
been
bitter
why
hesitate
to
drink
the
lees
the
monstrous
and
incredible
passion
of
the
race
was
slowly
creeping
upon
her
her
eyes
gleamed
and
her
cheeks
burned
the
hunger
for
death
at
her
own
hands
and
on
her
own
terms
possessed
her
frail
body
to
the
full
if
there
had
been
a
god
in
heaven
she
said
aloud
surely
i
must
have
died
the
words
startled
her
and
her
hand
shook
so
that
some
of
the
laudanum
was
spilled
it
was
long
since
she
had
heard
her
own
voice
in
more
than
a
monosyllabic
answer
to
some
necessary
question
inscrutably
veiled
in
many
folds
of
chiffon
she
held
herself
apart
from
the
world
and
the
world
carelessly
kind
had
left
her
wholly
to
herself
slowly
she
put
the
cork
tightly
into
the
vial
and
slipped
it
back
into
her
bag
tomorrow
she
sighed
i
shall
set
myself
free
the
fire
flickered
and
without
warning
the
candle
went
out
in
a
gust
of
wind
which
shook
the
house
to
its
foundations
stray
currents
of
air
had
come
through
the
crevices
of
the
rattling
windows
and
kept
up
an
imperfect
ventilation
she
took
another
candle
from
her
satchel
put
it
into
a
candlestick
of
blackened
brass
and
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
she
went
to
her
own
room
though
her
feet
failed
her
at
the
threshold
and
she
sank
helplessly
to
the
floor
too
weak
to
stand
she
made
her
way
on
her
knees
to
her
bed
leaving
the
candle
in
the
hall
just
outside
her
door
as
she
had
suspected
it
was
hardest
of
all
to
enter
this
room
a
pink
and
white
gown
of
dimity
yellowed
and
grimed
with
dust
yet
lay
upon
her
bed
cobwebs
were
woven
over
the
lace
that
trimmed
the
neck
and
sleeves
out
of
the
fearful
shadows
mute
reminders
of
a
lost
joy
mocked
her
from
every
corner
of
the
room
she
knelt
there
until
some
measure
of
strength
came
back
to
her
and
with
it
a
mad
fancy
she
said
to
herself
i
will
be
brave
for
once
i
will
play
a
part
since
i
shall
be
free
it
shall
be
as
though
nothing
had
happened
as
though
i
were
to
be
married
and
not
to
to
death
she
laughed
wildly
and
even
to
her
own
ears
it
had
a
fantastic
unearthly
sound
the
empty
rooms
took
up
the
echo
and
made
merry
with
it
the
sound
dying
at
last
into
a
silence
like
that
of
the
tomb
she
brought
in
the
candle
took
the
dimity
gown
from
the
bed
and
shook
it
to
remove
the
dust
in
her
hands
it
fell
apart
broken
because
it
was
too
frail
to
tear
she
laid
it
on
a
chair
folding
it
carefully
then
took
the
dusty
bedding
from
her
bed
and
carried
it
into
the
hall
dust
and
all
in
an
oaken
chest
in
a
corner
of
her
room
was
her
store
of
linen
hemmed
exquisitely
and
embroidered
with
the
initials
she
began
to
move
about
feverishly
fearing
that
her
resolution
might
fail
the
key
of
the
chest
was
in
a
drawer
in
her
dresser
hidden
beneath
a
pile
of
yellowed
garments
her
hands
so
long
nerveless
were
alive
and
sentient
now
when
she
opened
the
chest
the
scent
of
lavender
and
rosemary
long
since
dead
struck
her
like
a
blow
the
room
swam
before
her
yet
miss
evelina
dragged
forth
her
linen
sheets
and
musty
but
clean
and
made
her
bed
once
or
twice
her
veil
slipped
down
over
her
face
and
she
impatiently
pushed
it
back
the
candle
burning
low
warned
her
that
she
must
make
haste
in
one
of
the
smaller
drawers
of
her
dresser
was
a
nightgown
of
sheerest
linen
wonderfully
stitched
by
her
own
hands
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
opened
the
drawer
tiny
bags
of
sweet
herbs
fell
from
the
folds
as
she
shook
it
out
it
was
yellowed
and
musty
and
as
frail
as
a
bit
of
fine
lace
but
it
did
not
tear
in
her
hands
i
will
wear
it
she
thought
grimly
as
i
planned
to
do
long
ago
at
last
she
stood
before
her
mirror
the
lace
falling
away
from
her
neck
and
shoulders
her
neck
was
white
and
firm
but
her
right
shoulder
was
deeply
hideously
scarred
burned
body
and
burned
soul
she
muttered
and
this
my
wedding
night
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
pitied
herself
not
knowing
that
is
the
first
step
toward
relief
from
overpowering
sorrow
when
detachment
is
possible
the
long
slow
healing
has
faintly
but
surely
begun
she
unpinned
her
veil
took
down
her
heavy
white
hair
and
braided
it
there
was
no
gleam
of
silver
even
in
the
light
it
was
as
lustreless
as
a
field
of
snow
upon
a
dark
day
that
done
she
stood
there
staring
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
living
over
remorselessly
the
one
day
that
like
a
lightning
stroke
had
blasted
her
life
her
veil
slipped
unheeded
from
her
dresser
to
the
floor
leaning
forward
she
studied
her
face
that
she
had
once
loved
then
swiftly
learned
to
hate
even
on
the
street
closely
veiled
she
would
not
look
at
a
shop
window
lest
she
might
see
herself
reflected
in
the
plate
glass
and
she
had
kept
the
mirror
in
her
room
covered
with
a
cloth
since
the
day
she
left
the
hospital
where
they
all
had
been
so
kind
to
her
no
human
being
save
herself
had
seen
her
face
she
had
prayed
for
death
but
had
not
been
more
than
slightly
ill
upborne
as
she
was
by
a
great
grief
which
sustained
her
as
surely
as
an
ascetic
is
kept
alive
by
the
passion
of
his
faith
she
hungered
now
for
the
sight
of
her
face
as
she
hungered
for
death
and
held
the
flaring
candle
aloft
that
she
might
see
better
then
a
wave
of
impassioned
swept
her
like
flame
the
fire
was
kind
she
said
stubbornly
as
though
to
defend
herself
from
it
it
showed
me
the
truth
she
leaned
yet
closer
to
the
glass
holding
the
dripping
candle
on
high
the
fire
was
kind
she
insisted
again
then
the
floodgates
opened
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
the
sorrowful
years
she
felt
the
hot
tears
streaming
over
her
face
her
hand
shook
but
she
held
her
candle
tightly
and
leaned
so
close
to
the
mirror
that
her
white
hair
brushed
its
cracked
surface
the
fire
was
kind
sobbed
miss
evelina
oh
but
the
fire
was
kind
ii
miss
mehitable
the
slanting
sunbeams
of
late
afternoon
crept
through
the
cobwebbed
window
and
miss
evelina
stirred
uneasily
in
her
sleep
the
mocking
dream
vanished
and
she
awoke
to
feel
as
always
the
iron
icy
hand
that
unmercifully
clutched
her
heart
the
room
was
cold
and
she
shivered
as
she
lay
beneath
her
insufficient
covering
at
length
she
rose
and
dressed
mechanically
avoiding
the
mirror
and
pinning
her
veil
securely
to
her
hair
she
went
downstairs
slowly
clinging
to
the
railing
from
sheer
weakness
she
was
as
frail
and
ghostly
as
some
disembodied
spirit
of
grief
soon
she
had
a
fire
as
the
warmth
increased
she
opened
the
rear
door
of
the
house
to
dispel
the
musty
atmosphere
the
march
wind
blew
strong
and
clear
through
the
lonely
rooms
stirring
the
dust
before
it
and
swaying
the
cobwebs
suddenly
miss
evelina
heard
a
footstep
outside
and
instinctively
drew
down
her
veil
before
she
could
close
the
door
a
woman
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
appeared
on
the
threshold
peered
curiously
into
the
house
then
unhesitatingly
entered
for
the
land
sake
cried
a
cheery
voice
you
scared
me
most
to
death
i
saw
the
smoke
coming
from
the
chimney
and
thought
the
house
was
afire
so
i
come
over
to
see
miss
evelina
stiffened
and
made
no
reply
i
do
know
who
you
are
said
the
woman
again
mildly
defiant
but
this
is
evelina
grey
house
and
i
answered
miss
evelina
almost
inaudibly
am
evelina
grey
for
the
land
sake
cried
the
visitor
again
do
you
remember
me
why
evelina
you
and
i
used
to
go
to
school
together
you
she
stopped
abruptly
the
fact
of
the
veiled
face
confronted
her
stubbornly
she
ransacked
her
memory
for
a
forgotten
catastrophe
a
quarter
of
a
century
back
impenetrably
a
wall
was
reared
between
them
i
i
afraid
i
do
remember
stammered
miss
evelina
in
a
low
voice
hoping
that
the
intruder
would
go
i
used
to
be
mehitable
smith
and
that
what
i
am
still
having
been
spared
marriage
mehitable
is
my
name
but
folks
calls
me
hitty
miss
hitty
she
added
with
a
slight
accent
on
the
miss
oh
answered
miss
evelina
i
remember
though
she
did
not
remember
at
all
well
i
glad
you
come
back
went
on
the
guest
politely
altogether
in
the
manner
of
one
invited
to
do
so
she
removed
her
shawl
and
sat
down
furtively
eyeing
miss
evelina
yet
affecting
to
look
carelessly
about
the
house
she
was
a
woman
of
fifty
or
more
brisk
and
active
of
body
and
kindly
though
inquisitive
of
countenance
her
dark
hair
scarcely
touched
with
grey
was
parted
smoothly
in
the
exact
centre
and
plastered
down
on
both
sides
as
one
guessed
by
a
brush
and
cold
water
her
black
eyes
were
bright
and
keen
and
her
spectacles
were
habitually
worn
down
her
nose
her
mouth
and
chin
were
indicative
of
great
firmness
those
whose
misfortune
it
was
to
differ
from
miss
hitty
were
accustomed
to
call
it
obstinacy
people
of
plainer
speech
said
it
was
mulishness
her
gown
was
dark
calico
stiffly
starched
and
made
according
to
the
durable
and
comfortable
pattern
of
her
all
in
one
piece
miss
hitty
was
wont
to
say
then
when
i
bend
over
as
folks
that
does
housework
has
to
bend
over
occasionally
i
do
come
apart
in
the
back
for
my
part
i
never
could
see
sense
in
wearing
clothes
that
held
by
a
in
the
back
instead
of
good
firm
cloth
and
moreover
a
belt
that
either
slides
around
or
pinches
where
it
ai
pleasant
to
be
pinched
ai
my
notion
of
comfort
apron
strings
is
bad
enough
for
you
have
to
have
tight
to
keep
from
slipping
miss
hitty
had
never
worn
corsets
and
had
the
straight
slender
figure
of
a
boy
the
situation
became
awkward
miss
evelina
still
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
veiled
face
slightly
averted
the
impenetrable
shelter
of
chiffon
awed
miss
mehitable
but
she
was
not
a
woman
to
give
up
easily
when
embarked
upon
the
quest
for
knowledge
some
unusual
state
of
mind
kept
her
from
asking
a
direct
question
about
the
veil
and
meanwhile
she
continually
racked
her
memory
miss
evelina
white
slender
hands
opened
and
closed
nervously
miss
hitty
set
her
feet
squarely
on
the
floor
and
tucked
her
immaculate
white
apron
closely
about
her
knees
when
did
you
come
she
demanded
finally
with
the
air
of
the
attorney
for
the
prosecution
last
night
murmured
miss
evelina
on
that
late
train
yes
i
heard
it
stop
but
i
never
sensed
it
was
you
seemed
to
me
i
heard
somebody
go
by
too
but
i
was
too
sleepy
to
get
up
and
see
i
thought
i
must
be
dreaming
but
i
was
sure
i
heard
somebody
on
the
walk
if
i
known
it
was
you
i
have
made
you
stop
at
my
house
for
the
rest
of
the
night
instead
of
coming
up
here
alone
very
kind
said
miss
evelina
after
an
uncomfortable
pause
you
might
as
well
set
down
remarked
miss
hitty
with
a
new
gentleness
of
manner
i
going
to
set
a
spell
miss
evelina
sat
helplessly
in
the
chair
which
she
hated
and
turned
her
veiled
face
yet
farther
away
from
her
guest
seeing
that
her
hostess
did
not
intend
to
talk
miss
hitty
began
a
conversation
if
anything
wholly
may
be
so
termed
i
live
in
the
same
place
she
said
ma
died
seventeen
years
ago
on
the
eighteenth
of
next
april
and
left
the
house
and
the
income
for
me
there
was
enough
to
take
care
of
two
and
so
i
took
my
sister
child
araminta
to
bring
up
you
know
my
poor
sister
got
married
she
ought
to
have
known
better
but
she
did
she
just
put
her
head
into
the
noose
and
it
slipped
up
on
her
as
i
told
her
it
would
both
before
and
after
the
ceremony
having
seen
all
the
trouble
men
make
in
the
world
i
sh
think
women
would
know
enough
to
keep
away
from
but
they
do
that
is
some
women
do
miss
hitty
smoothed
her
stiff
white
apron
with
an
air
of
conscious
virtue
araminta
was
only
a
year
old
when
her
ma
got
enough
of
marrying
and
went
to
her
reward
in
heaven
what
she
been
through
would
have
tried
the
patience
of
a
saint
and
barbara
was
no
saint
none
of
the
smith
family
have
ever
grown
wings
here
on
earth
but
it
my
belief
that
we
all
be
awarded
our
proper
plumage
in
heaven
he
the
pronoun
was
sufficiently
definite
to
indicate
hapless
father
was
always
tracking
dirt
into
the
clean
kitchen
and
he
had
an
appetite
like
a
horse
barbara
would
make
a
cake
to
set
away
for
company
and
he
gobble
it
all
up
at
one
meal
just
as
if
was
a
doughnut
she
was
forever
cooking
and
washing
dishes
and
sweeping
up
after
him
when
he
come
into
the
house
she
run
for
the
broom
and
dustpan
and
follow
him
around
sweeping
up
and
if
you
believe
me
the
brute
scolded
her
for
it
he
actually
said
once
in
my
presence
that
if
he
known
how
neat
she
was
he
did
believe
he
have
married
her
that
shows
what
men
are
if
it
needs
showing
it
no
wonder
poor
barbara
died
i
hope
there
ai
any
brooms
in
heaven
and
that
she
havin
a
good
rest
now
araminta
goin
on
nineteen
and
she
a
sensible
girl
if
i
do
say
it
as
should
she
never
spoke
to
a
man
except
to
say
and
i
taught
her
to
steer
clear
of
and
even
when
she
was
only
seven
years
old
she
run
if
she
saw
one
coming
she
knows
they
pizen
and
i
do
believe
i
ever
have
any
cause
to
worry
about
minty
i
got
the
minister
boarding
with
me
pursued
miss
hitty
undaunted
and
cheerfully
taking
a
fresh
start
ministers
count
and
i
must
say
that
for
a
man
thorpe
is
very
little
trouble
he
wipes
his
feet
sometimes
for
as
much
as
five
minutes
when
he
coming
in
and
mostly
when
it
pleasant
weather
he
out
when
he
in
he
usually
stays
in
his
room
except
at
meals
he
do
eat
much
more
a
canary
and
likes
what
he
eats
and
do
need
hardly
any
pickin
up
after
though
a
week
ago
last
saturday
he
left
a
collar
layin
on
the
bureau
instead
of
putting
it
into
his
bag
i
left
it
right
where
was
and
sunday
morning
he
put
it
where
it
belonged
he
never
been
married
and
he
learned
to
pick
up
after
himself
i
would
have
had
him
on
araminta
account
only
that
there
was
no
other
place
for
him
to
stay
and
it
was
put
to
me
by
the
elders
as
being
my
christian
duty
i
would
have
took
him
otherwise
and
we
never
had
an
unmarried
minister
before
besides
thorpe
ai
pleasing
the
congregation
and
i
do
know
that
he
stay
long
he
been
here
six
months
and
three
sundays
over
and
i
been
to
every
single
service
church
and
and
and
he
ai
never
said
one
word
about
hell
all
of
the
joys
of
heaven
and
a
sure
reward
in
the
hereafter
for
everybody
that
done
what
they
think
is
right
nothing
much
mind
you
about
what
is
right
why
when
brewster
was
preaching
for
us
some
of
the
sinners
would
get
up
and
run
right
out
of
the
church
when
he
got
started
on
hell
and
the
lost
souls
writhin
in
the
flames
that
was
a
minister
worth
having
but
thorpe
now
he
does
seem
to
have
no
sense
of
the
duties
of
his
position
week
before
last
i
heard
of
his
walkin
along
the
river
with
andy
rogers
arm
in
arm
if
you
believe
me
with
the
worst
drunkard
and
chicken
thief
in
town
the
very
idea
of
a
minister
associatin
with
sinners
brewster
would
never
have
done
that
why
andy
was
one
of
them
that
run
out
of
the
church
the
day
the
minister
give
us
that
movin
sermon
on
hell
and
he
ai
never
dared
to
show
his
face
in
a
place
of
worship
since
as
i
said
i
do
think
thorpe
be
with
us
long
for
the
vestry
and
the
congregation
is
getting
dissatisfied
there
ai
been
any
open
talk
except
in
the
ladies
aid
society
but
public
opinion
is
settin
pretty
strongly
in
that
direction
miss
hitty
dropped
her
final
g
when
she
got
thoroughly
interested
in
her
subject
and
at
times
became
deeply
involved
in
grammatical
complications
us
older
ones
that
strong
in
the
faith
ai
likely
to
be
injured
by
it
i
suppose
but
there
always
the
young
ones
to
be
considered
and
it
highly
important
for
araminta
to
have
the
right
kind
of
influence
of
course
thorpe
do
talk
on
religious
subjects
at
home
and
i
ai
let
araminta
go
to
church
the
last
two
sundays
meanwhile
i
talked
hell
to
her
stronger
common
but
upon
my
soul
i
do
know
what
rushton
is
comin
to
a
month
or
so
ago
there
was
an
outlandish
heathen
character
come
here
that
beats
anything
i
ever
heard
tell
of
his
name
is
tom
barnaby
and
he
set
up
a
store
on
the
edge
of
town
in
the
front
parlour
of
widow
house
she
went
and
rented
it
to
him
and
she
says
he
pays
his
rent
regular
he
wears
leather
leggings
and
a
hat
with
a
red
feather
stuck
in
it
and
he
gone
into
competition
with
allen
who
kept
the
here
for
the
last
twenty
years
of
course
she
went
on
a
little
wistfully
i
always
patronised
allen
and
i
always
shall
they
do
say
barnaby
goods
is
a
great
deal
cheaper
but
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
buy
of
a
woman
anyhow
even
though
she
has
been
married
she
been
a
widow
for
so
long
it
most
the
same
as
if
she
never
been
married
at
ail
barnaby
lives
with
a
dog
and
does
for
himself
but
he
hardly
ever
in
his
store
people
go
there
to
buy
things
and
find
the
door
propped
open
with
a
brick
and
a
sign
says
to
come
in
and
take
what
you
want
the
price
of
everything
is
marked
good
and
plain
and
another
sign
says
to
put
the
money
in
the
drawer
and
make
your
own
change
the
blacksmith
was
at
him
for
doing
business
so
shiftless
and
barnaby
laughed
and
said
that
if
anybody
wanted
anything
he
had
bad
enough
to
steal
it
whoever
it
was
he
was
good
and
welcome
to
it
that
just
shows
how
crazy
he
is
most
of
the
time
he
roaming
around
the
country
with
his
yellow
dog
at
his
heels
making
outlandish
noises
on
some
kind
of
a
flute
he
ca
play
a
tune
but
he
keeps
trying
folks
around
here
call
him
piper
tom
of
course
i
would
want
allen
to
know
but
i
thought
that
sometime
when
he
was
away
and
there
was
nobody
there
to
see
i
just
step
in
for
a
few
minutes
and
take
a
look
at
his
goods
elmiry
jones
says
his
calico
is
beautiful
and
that
for
her
part
she
going
to
trade
there
instead
of
at
allen
i
suppose
it
is
a
temptation
i
might
do
it
myself
if
want
for
my
principles
the
speaker
paused
for
breath
but
miss
evelina
still
sat
silently
in
her
chair
what
was
it
thought
miss
hitty
i
was
here
and
i
knew
at
the
time
but
what
happened
how
did
i
come
to
forget
i
must
be
getting
old
she
searched
her
memory
without
result
her
house
was
situated
at
the
crossroads
and
being
on
higher
ground
commanded
a
good
view
of
the
village
below
gradually
her
dooryard
had
become
a
sort
of
clearing
house
for
neighbourhood
gossip
travellers
going
and
coming
stopped
at
miss
hitty
to
drink
from
the
well
give
their
bit
of
news
and
receive
in
return
the
scandal
of
the
countryside
had
it
not
been
for
the
faithful
and
industrious
miss
mehitable
the
town
might
have
needed
a
daily
paper
strange
i
ca
think
she
said
to
herself
i
do
doubt
come
to
me
though
something
happened
to
evelina
and
she
went
away
and
her
mother
went
with
her
to
take
care
of
her
and
then
her
mother
died
all
at
once
of
heart
failure
it
happened
the
same
week
old
mis
hicks
had
a
doctor
from
the
city
for
an
operation
and
the
millerses
barn
was
struck
by
lightning
and
burnt
up
and
so
i
it
no
wonder
i
sorter
lost
track
of
it
miss
evelina
veiled
face
was
wholly
averted
now
and
miss
hitty
studied
her
shrewdly
she
noted
that
the
black
gown
was
and
had
indeed
been
patched
in
several
places
the
shoes
which
tapped
impatiently
on
the
floor
were
undeniably
shabby
though
they
had
been
carefully
blacked
against
the
unrelieved
sombreness
of
her
gown
miss
evelina
hands
were
singularly
frail
and
transparent
every
line
of
her
body
was
eloquent
of
weakness
and
insupportable
grief
well
said
miss
hitty
again
though
she
felt
that
the
words
were
flat
i
glad
you
come
back
it
seems
like
old
times
for
us
to
be
settin
here
talkin
and
here
she
laughed
shrilly
we
both
been
spared
marriage
a
small
slender
hand
clutched
convulsively
at
the
arm
of
the
haircloth
chair
but
miss
evelina
did
not
speak
i
see
went
on
miss
hitty
not
unkindly
that
you
still
in
mourning
for
your
mother
you
must
take
it
so
hard
sometimes
folks
get
to
feeling
so
sorry
about
something
that
they
ca
never
get
over
it
and
they
keep
on
going
round
and
round
all
the
time
like
a
squirrel
in
a
wheel
and
keep
on
getting
weaker
till
it
gets
to
be
a
kind
of
disease
there
ai
no
cure
for
leastwise
that
what
doctor
dexter
says
doctor
dexter
with
a
cry
miss
evelina
sprang
to
her
feet
her
hands
tightly
pressed
to
her
heart
the
same
nodded
miss
hitty
overjoyed
to
discover
that
at
last
her
hostess
was
interested
doctor
anthony
dexter
our
old
schoolmate
as
had
just
graduated
when
you
lived
here
before
he
went
away
for
a
year
and
then
he
came
back
bringing
a
pretty
young
wife
she
dead
but
he
has
a
son
ralph
who
away
studying
to
be
a
doctor
graduate
this
spring
and
then
he
coming
here
to
help
his
father
with
his
practice
doctor
dexter
getting
old
like
the
rest
of
us
and
he
do
like
the
night
work
some
folks
is
inconsiderate
enough
to
get
sick
in
the
night
they
orter
have
regular
hours
for
it
same
as
a
doctor
has
hours
for
business
things
would
fit
better
well
i
must
be
going
for
i
left
soup
on
the
stove
and
likely
as
not
to
let
it
burn
i
going
to
send
your
supper
over
to
you
and
next
week
if
the
weather
favourable
we
clean
this
house
goodness
knows
it
needs
it
i
just
as
soon
send
over
all
your
meals
till
you
get
settled
would
be
any
trouble
or
you
can
come
over
to
my
house
if
you
would
mind
eating
with
the
minister
it
seems
queer
to
set
down
to
the
table
with
a
man
and
not
altogether
natural
but
i
beginning
to
get
used
to
it
and
it
gives
us
the
advantage
of
a
blessing
and
anyway
ministers
do
count
come
over
when
you
can
goodbye
with
a
rustle
of
stiffly
starched
garments
miss
mehitable
took
her
departure
carefully
closing
the
door
and
avoiding
the
appearance
of
haste
this
was
an
effort
for
every
fibre
of
her
being
ached
to
get
back
to
the
clearing
house
where
she
might
speculate
upon
return
it
was
her
desire
also
to
hunt
up
the
oldest
inhabitant
before
nightfall
and
correct
her
pitiful
lapse
of
memory
at
the
same
time
she
was
planning
to
send
araminta
over
with
a
nice
hot
supper
for
miss
evelina
seemed
to
be
far
from
strong
and
even
to
one
lacking
in
discernment
acutely
unhappy
down
the
road
she
went
her
head
bowed
in
deep
and
fruitless
thought
swiftly
as
in
a
lightning
flash
and
without
premonition
she
remembered
evelina
was
burnt
she
said
to
herself
triumphantly
over
to
doctor
dexter
and
they
took
her
on
the
train
to
the
hospital
i
guess
she
wears
that
veil
all
the
time
then
miss
hitty
stopped
at
her
own
gate
catching
her
breath
quickly
she
must
have
been
burnt
awful
she
thought
poor
soul
she
murmured
her
sharp
eyes
softening
with
tears
poor
soul
iii
the
pearls
a
rap
at
the
door
roused
miss
evelina
from
a
deadly
stupor
which
seemed
stabbed
through
with
daggers
of
pain
she
sat
quite
still
determined
not
to
open
the
door
presently
she
heard
the
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
and
was
reassured
then
she
saw
a
bit
of
folded
paper
which
had
been
slipped
under
the
door
and
mechanically
she
picked
it
up
here
your
supper
the
note
read
briefly
when
you
get
done
leave
the
tray
outside
i
come
and
get
it
i
would
like
to
have
you
come
over
if
you
want
mehitable
smith
touched
by
the
unexpected
kindness
miss
evelina
took
in
the
tray
there
was
a
bowl
of
soup
steaming
hot
a
baked
potato
a
bit
of
thin
steak
fried
in
country
fashion
two
crisp
buttered
rolls
and
a
pot
of
tea
faint
and
sick
of
heart
she
pushed
it
aside
then
in
simple
justice
to
miss
hitty
tasted
of
the
soup
a
little
later
she
put
the
tray
out
on
the
doorstep
again
having
eaten
as
she
had
not
eaten
for
months
she
considered
the
chain
of
circumstances
that
had
led
her
back
to
rushton
first
the
knowledge
that
doctor
dexter
had
left
the
place
for
good
she
had
heard
of
that
long
ago
but
until
now
no
one
had
told
her
that
he
had
returned
she
had
thought
it
impossible
for
him
ever
to
return
even
to
think
of
it
again
otherwise
here
the
thread
of
her
thought
snapped
and
she
clutched
at
the
vial
of
laudanum
which
as
always
was
in
the
bag
at
her
belt
she
perceived
that
the
way
of
escape
was
closed
to
her
broken
in
spirit
though
she
was
she
was
yet
too
proud
to
die
like
a
dog
at
anthony
dexter
door
even
after
years
bitterest
need
alone
had
driven
her
to
take
the
step
which
she
so
keenly
regretted
now
the
death
of
her
mother
hastened
by
misfortune
had
left
her
with
a
small
but
certain
income
paid
regularly
from
two
separate
sources
one
source
had
failed
without
warning
and
her
slender
legacy
was
cut
literally
in
two
upon
the
remaining
half
she
must
eke
out
the
rest
of
her
existence
if
she
continued
to
exist
at
all
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
her
to
come
back
to
the
one
shelter
which
she
could
call
her
own
weary
despairing
and
still
in
the
merciless
grip
of
her
obsession
she
had
come
only
to
find
that
anthony
dexter
had
long
since
preceded
her
a
year
afterward
miss
hitty
said
he
had
come
back
with
a
pretty
young
wife
and
he
had
a
son
the
new
knowledge
hurt
and
evelina
had
fancied
that
she
could
be
hurt
no
more
that
she
had
reached
the
uttermost
limits
of
pain
by
a
singular
irony
the
last
refuge
was
denied
her
at
the
very
moment
of
her
greatest
temptation
to
avail
herself
of
it
long
hours
of
thought
led
her
invariably
to
the
one
possible
conclusion
to
avoid
every
one
keep
wholly
to
herself
and
by
starvation
if
need
be
save
enough
of
her
insignificant
pittance
to
take
her
far
away
and
after
that
freedom
since
the
night
of
full
realisation
which
had
turned
her
brown
hair
to
a
dull
white
she
had
thought
of
death
in
but
one
way
escape
set
free
from
the
insufferable
bondage
of
earthly
existence
miss
evelina
dreamed
of
peace
as
a
prisoner
in
a
dungeon
may
dream
of
green
fields
to
sleep
and
wake
no
more
never
to
feel
again
the
cold
hand
upon
her
heart
that
tore
persistently
at
the
inmost
fibres
of
it
to
forget
miss
evelina
took
the
vial
from
her
bag
and
uncorked
it
the
incense
of
the
poppies
crept
subtly
through
the
room
mingling
inextricably
with
the
mustiness
and
the
dust
the
grey
cobwebs
swayed
at
the
windows
sunset
touching
them
to
iridescence
conscious
that
she
was
the
most
desolate
and
lonely
thing
in
all
the
desolate
house
miss
evelina
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
the
poppies
breathed
from
the
vial
in
her
distorted
fancy
she
saw
vast
plains
of
them
shimmering
in
the
sun
scarlet
like
the
lips
of
a
girl
pink
as
the
flush
of
dawn
upon
the
eastern
sky
as
the
passionate
heart
that
never
dreamed
of
betrayal
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
field
of
poppies
and
miss
evelina
walked
among
them
her
face
unveiled
golden
masses
of
bloom
were
spread
at
her
feet
starred
here
and
there
by
stately
blossoms
as
white
as
the
blown
snow
her
ragged
garments
touched
the
silken
petals
her
worn
shoes
crushed
them
bud
and
blossom
alike
always
the
numbing
sleepy
odour
came
from
the
field
dew
was
on
the
petals
of
the
flowers
their
deep
cups
gathered
it
and
held
it
never
to
be
surrendered
since
the
dew
of
the
poppies
was
tears
like
some
evil
genius
rising
from
the
bottle
the
spirit
of
the
poppies
seemed
to
incarnate
itself
in
the
vapour
a
woman
with
a
face
of
deadly
white
arose
to
meet
miss
evelina
with
outspread
arms
in
her
eyes
was
lethe
in
her
hands
was
the
gift
of
forgetfulness
she
brought
pardon
for
all
that
was
past
and
to
come
eternal
healing
unfathomable
oblivion
come
the
drowsy
voice
seemed
to
say
i
have
waited
long
and
yet
you
do
not
come
the
peace
that
passeth
all
understanding
is
mine
to
give
and
yours
to
take
come
only
come
come
come
miss
evelina
laughed
bitterly
never
in
all
the
years
gone
by
had
the
spirit
of
the
poppies
pleaded
with
her
thus
now
at
the
hour
when
surrender
meant
the
complete
triumph
of
her
enemy
the
ghostly
figure
came
to
offer
her
the
last
and
supreme
gift
the
afterglow
yet
lingered
in
the
west
the
grey
of
a
march
twilight
was
in
the
valley
but
it
was
still
late
afternoon
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
miss
evelina
drew
her
veil
about
her
and
went
out
into
the
garden
the
vial
in
her
hand
where
was
it
that
she
had
planted
the
poppies
through
the
mass
of
undergrowth
and
brambles
she
made
scant
headway
thorns
pressed
forward
rudely
as
if
to
stab
the
intruder
vines
closely
matted
forbade
her
to
pass
yet
she
kept
on
until
she
reached
the
western
slope
of
the
garden
here
unshaded
and
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
summer
sun
the
poppies
had
spread
their
brilliant
pageantry
in
all
the
village
there
had
been
no
such
poppies
as
grew
in
evelina
garden
now
they
were
dead
and
only
the
overgrown
stubble
was
left
dust
to
dust
earth
to
earth
and
ashes
to
ashes
the
solemn
words
of
the
burial
service
were
chanted
in
her
consciousness
as
she
lifted
the
vial
high
and
emptied
it
she
held
it
steadily
until
the
last
drop
was
drained
from
it
the
poppies
had
given
it
and
to
the
poppies
she
had
returned
it
she
put
the
cork
into
the
empty
vial
and
flung
it
far
away
from
her
then
turned
back
to
the
house
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
upon
the
road
miss
evelina
hastened
her
steps
but
the
dense
undergrowth
made
walking
difficult
praying
that
she
might
not
be
seen
she
turned
her
head
anthony
dexter
in
the
doctor
carriage
was
travelling
at
a
leisurely
pace
as
he
passed
the
old
house
he
glanced
at
it
mechanically
from
sheer
force
of
habit
long
ago
it
had
ceased
to
have
any
definite
meaning
for
him
once
he
had
even
stripped
every
white
rose
from
the
neglected
bush
at
the
gate
to
take
to
his
wife
who
that
day
for
the
first
time
had
held
their
son
in
her
arms
motionless
in
the
wreck
of
the
garden
a
veiled
figure
stood
with
averted
face
doctor
dexter
looked
keenly
for
an
instant
in
the
fast
gathering
twilight
then
whipped
up
his
horse
and
was
swiftly
out
of
sight
against
his
better
judgment
he
was
shaken
in
mind
and
body
could
he
have
seen
a
ghost
nonsense
he
was
tired
he
had
overworked
he
had
had
an
hallucination
his
cool
calm
professional
sense
fought
with
the
insistent
idea
it
was
well
that
ralph
was
coming
to
relieve
his
old
father
of
a
part
of
his
burden
meanwhile
miss
evelina
her
frail
body
quivering
as
though
under
the
lash
crept
back
into
the
house
with
the
sure
intuition
of
a
woman
she
knew
who
had
driven
by
in
the
first
darkness
that
he
should
dare
that
he
should
actually
trespass
upon
her
road
take
the
insolent
liberty
of
looking
at
her
house
a
pretty
young
wife
miss
hitty
had
said
yes
doubtless
a
pretty
one
anthony
dexter
delighted
in
the
beauty
of
a
woman
in
the
same
impersonal
way
that
another
man
would
regard
a
picture
and
a
son
a
straight
tall
young
fellow
doubtless
with
eyes
like
his
father
eyes
that
a
woman
would
trust
not
dreaming
of
the
false
heart
and
craven
soul
why
had
she
been
brought
here
to
suffer
this
last
insult
this
last
humiliation
weakly
as
many
a
woman
before
her
miss
evelina
groped
in
the
maze
of
life
searching
for
some
clue
to
its
blind
mystery
was
it
possible
that
she
had
not
suffered
enough
if
years
of
sodden
misery
were
not
sufficient
for
one
who
had
done
no
wrong
what
punishment
would
be
meted
out
to
a
sinner
by
a
god
who
was
always
kind
miss
evelina
lips
curled
scornfully
she
had
taken
what
he
should
have
borne
anthony
dexter
had
gone
scot
free
the
man
sins
and
the
woman
pays
the
cynical
saying
which
after
all
is
not
wholly
untrue
took
shape
in
her
thought
and
said
itself
aloud
yet
it
was
not
altogether
impossible
that
he
might
yet
be
made
to
pay
could
be
her
cheeks
burned
and
her
hands
closed
tightly
what
if
she
were
the
chosen
instrument
what
if
she
had
been
sent
here
after
all
the
dead
miserable
years
for
some
purpose
which
hitherto
she
had
not
guessed
what
if
she
herself
with
her
veiled
face
were
to
be
the
tardy
avenger
of
her
own
wrong
her
soul
stirred
in
its
despair
as
the
dead
might
stir
in
the
winding
sheet
out
of
her
sodden
grief
could
she
ever
emerge
alive
the
fire
was
kind
said
miss
evelina
in
a
whisper
it
showed
me
the
truth
the
fire
was
kind
and
god
is
kind
he
has
brought
me
here
to
pay
my
debt
in
full
she
began
to
consider
what
she
might
do
that
would
hurt
anthony
dexter
and
make
him
suffer
as
she
had
suffered
for
half
a
lifetime
if
he
had
forgotten
she
would
make
him
remember
ah
yes
he
must
remember
before
he
could
be
hurt
but
what
could
she
do
what
had
he
given
her
aside
from
the
misery
that
she
hungered
to
give
back
to
him
the
pearls
miss
evelina
lighted
her
candle
and
hurried
upstairs
in
her
dower
chest
beneath
the
piles
of
heavy
yellowed
linen
was
a
small
jewel
case
she
knelt
before
the
chest
gasping
and
thrust
her
questioning
fingers
down
through
the
linen
to
the
solid
oak
with
a
little
cry
she
rose
to
her
feet
the
jewel
case
in
her
hand
the
purple
velvet
was
crushed
the
satin
was
yellowed
but
the
string
of
pearls
was
there
yellowed
too
by
the
slow
passage
of
the
years
one
or
two
of
them
were
black
a
slip
of
paper
fluttered
out
as
she
opened
the
case
and
she
caught
it
as
it
fell
the
paper
was
yellow
and
brittle
and
the
ink
had
faded
but
the
words
were
still
there
written
in
anthony
dexter
clear
bold
hand
first
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
then
from
the
depths
of
my
love
depths
muttered
miss
evelina
from
between
her
clenched
teeth
once
the
necklace
had
been
beautiful
a
single
strand
of
large
perfectly
matched
pearls
the
gold
of
the
clasp
was
dull
but
the
diamond
gleamed
like
the
eye
of
some
evil
thing
she
wound
the
necklace
twice
about
her
wrist
then
shuddered
for
it
was
cold
and
smooth
and
sinuous
like
a
snake
she
coiled
the
discoloured
necklace
carefully
upon
its
yellowed
satin
bed
laid
the
folded
slip
of
paper
over
it
and
closed
it
with
a
snap
no
this
very
night
anthony
dexter
should
have
the
pearls
that
had
come
first
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
then
from
the
depths
of
his
love
no
hand
but
hers
should
give
them
back
for
she
saw
it
written
in
the
scheme
of
vengeance
that
she
herself
should
mutely
make
him
pay
she
felt
a
new
strength
of
body
and
a
fresh
clearness
of
mind
as
with
grim
patience
she
set
herself
to
wait
the
clocks
in
the
house
were
all
still
miss
evelina
watch
had
long
ago
been
sold
there
was
no
town
clock
in
the
village
but
the
train
upon
which
she
had
come
was
due
shortly
after
midnight
she
knew
every
step
of
the
way
by
dark
as
well
as
by
daylight
but
the
night
was
clear
and
there
would
be
the
light
of
the
dying
moon
her
own
clouded
skies
were
clearing
dimly
she
began
to
perceive
herself
as
a
part
of
things
not
set
aside
helplessly
to
suffer
eternally
but
in
some
sort
of
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
world
on
the
sunday
before
the
catastrophe
miss
evelina
had
been
to
church
and
even
yet
she
remembered
fragments
of
the
sermon
god
often
uses
people
to
carry
out
his
plans
the
minister
had
said
at
the
time
it
had
not
particularly
impressed
her
and
she
had
never
gone
to
church
again
if
she
had
listened
further
she
might
have
heard
the
minister
say
that
the
devil
was
wont
to
do
the
same
thing
minute
by
minute
the
hours
passed
miss
evelina
heart
was
beating
painfully
but
all
unknowingly
she
had
entered
upon
a
new
phase
she
had
turned
in
the
winding
sheet
of
her
own
weaving
and
her
hands
were
clutching
at
the
binding
fabric
at
last
the
train
came
in
it
did
not
stop
but
thundered
through
the
sleeping
village
shrieking
as
it
went
the
sound
died
into
a
distant
rumble
then
merged
into
the
stillness
of
the
night
miss
evelina
rose
from
her
chair
put
on
her
wraps
slipped
the
jewel
case
into
her
bag
and
went
out
closely
veiled
the
light
of
the
waning
moon
was
dim
and
veiled
as
she
was
she
felt
rather
than
saw
the
way
steadfastly
she
went
down
the
steep
road
avoiding
the
sidewalk
for
she
remembered
that
miss
mehitable
ears
were
keen
past
the
crossroads
to
the
right
down
into
the
village
across
the
tracks
then
sharply
to
the
left
the
way
was
the
same
but
the
wayfarer
was
sadly
changed
she
went
unemotionally
seeing
herself
a
divinely
appointed
instrument
of
vengeance
something
outside
her
obsession
had
its
clutch
upon
her
also
but
it
was
new
and
she
did
not
guess
that
it
was
fully
as
hideous
doctor
dexter
house
was
near
the
corner
on
a
shaded
street
at
the
gate
miss
evelina
paused
and
with
her
veil
lifted
carefully
scrutinised
the
house
for
a
possible
light
she
feared
that
some
one
might
be
stirring
late
as
it
was
but
the
old
housekeeper
always
went
to
bed
promptly
at
nine
and
on
this
particular
night
anthony
dexter
had
gone
to
his
room
at
ten
making
sleep
sure
by
a
drug
with
hushed
steps
miss
evelina
went
furtively
up
to
the
house
on
the
bare
earth
beside
the
brick
pavement
she
was
in
a
panic
of
fear
but
something
beyond
her
control
urged
her
on
reaching
the
steps
she
hesitated
baffled
for
the
moment
then
sank
to
her
knees
slowly
she
crept
to
the
threshold
placed
the
jewel
case
so
that
it
would
fall
inward
when
the
door
was
opened
and
started
back
instinct
bade
her
hurry
but
reason
made
her
cautious
she
forced
herself
to
walk
slowly
and
to
muffle
the
latch
of
the
gate
with
her
skirts
as
she
had
done
when
she
came
in
it
seemed
an
hour
before
she
crossed
the
tracks
again
at
the
deserted
point
she
had
chosen
but
in
reality
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
at
last
she
reached
home
utterly
exhausted
by
the
strain
she
had
put
upon
herself
she
had
seen
no
one
heard
no
footstep
save
her
own
she
had
gone
and
returned
as
mysteriously
as
the
night
itself
when
she
slept
she
dreamed
of
the
poppy
bed
on
the
western
slope
of
the
garden
it
was
twilight
and
she
stood
there
with
a
vial
of
laudanum
in
one
hand
and
a
necklace
of
discoloured
pearls
in
the
other
she
poured
the
laudanum
upon
the
earth
and
a
great
black
poppy
with
a
deadly
fragrance
sprang
up
at
her
feet
then
anthony
dexter
drove
up
in
a
carriage
and
took
the
pearls
away
from
her
she
could
not
see
him
clearly
because
his
face
was
veiled
like
her
own
the
odour
of
the
black
poppy
made
her
faint
and
she
went
into
the
house
to
escape
from
it
but
the
scent
of
it
clung
to
her
garments
and
hands
and
could
not
be
washed
away
iv
from
the
depths
of
his
love
at
seven
precisely
anthony
dexter
old
housekeeper
rang
the
rising
bell
drowsy
with
the
soporific
he
had
taken
the
doctor
did
not
at
once
respond
to
the
summons
in
fact
the
breakfast
bell
had
rung
before
he
was
fully
awake
he
dressed
leisurely
and
was
haunted
by
a
vague
feeling
that
something
unpleasant
had
happened
at
length
he
remembered
that
just
before
dusk
in
the
garden
of
evelina
grey
old
house
he
had
seen
a
ghost
a
ghost
who
confronted
him
mutely
with
a
thing
he
had
long
since
forgotten
it
was
subjective
purely
mused
anthony
dexter
i
have
been
working
too
hard
his
reason
was
fully
satisfied
with
the
plausible
explanation
but
he
was
not
a
man
who
was
likely
to
have
an
hallucination
of
any
sort
he
was
strong
and
straight
of
body
finely
muscular
and
did
not
look
over
forty
though
it
was
more
than
eight
years
ago
that
he
had
reached
the
fortieth
milestone
his
hair
was
thinning
a
little
at
the
temples
and
the
rest
of
it
was
touched
generously
with
grey
his
features
were
regular
and
his
skin
clear
a
full
beard
closely
cropped
hid
the
weakness
of
his
chin
but
did
not
entirely
conceal
those
fine
lines
about
the
mouth
which
mean
cruelty
someway
in
looking
at
him
one
got
the
impression
of
a
machine
perfect
of
its
kind
his
dark
eyes
were
sharp
and
penetrating
once
they
had
been
sympathetic
but
he
had
outgrown
that
his
hands
were
large
white
and
his
fingers
knotted
and
blunt
at
the
tips
he
had
the
hand
of
the
surgeon
capable
of
swiftness
and
strength
and
yet
of
delicacy
it
was
not
a
hand
that
would
tremble
easily
it
was
powerful
and
in
a
way
brutal
he
was
thoroughly
as
well
he
might
be
for
the
entire
countryside
admitted
his
skill
and
even
in
the
operating
rooms
of
the
hospitals
in
the
city
not
far
distant
doctor
dexter
name
was
well
known
he
had
thought
seriously
at
times
of
seeking
a
wider
field
but
he
liked
the
country
and
the
open
air
and
his
practice
would
give
ralph
the
opportunity
he
needed
at
his
father
death
the
young
physician
would
fail
heir
to
a
practice
which
had
taken
many
years
of
hard
work
to
build
up
at
the
thought
of
ralph
the
man
face
softened
a
trifle
and
his
keen
eyes
became
a
little
less
keen
the
boy
picture
was
before
him
upon
his
chiffonier
ralph
was
now
and
would
finish
in
a
few
weeks
at
a
famous
medical
school
doctor
dexter
own
alma
mater
he
had
not
been
at
home
since
he
entered
the
school
having
undertaken
to
do
in
three
years
the
work
which
usually
required
four
he
wrote
frequently
however
and
doctor
dexter
invariably
went
to
the
himself
on
the
days
ralph
letters
were
expected
he
had
the
entire
correspondence
on
file
and
whiled
away
many
a
lonely
evening
by
reading
and
the
breezy
epistles
the
last
one
was
in
his
pocket
now
to
think
father
ralph
had
written
in
three
weeks
more
or
less
i
shall
be
at
home
with
my
sheepskin
and
a
fine
new
shingle
with
ralph
dexter
painted
on
it
all
ready
to
hang
up
on
the
front
of
the
house
beside
yours
i
be
glad
to
get
out
of
the
grind
for
a
while
i
can
tell
you
that
i
worked
as
his
satanic
majesty
undoubtedly
does
when
he
receives
word
that
a
fresh
batch
of
mormons
has
hit
the
trail
for
the
pavement
facilis
that
about
all
the
latin
i
got
left
at
first
i
suppose
there
wo
be
much
for
me
to
do
i
have
to
win
the
confidence
of
the
community
by
listening
to
the
old
symptoms
three
or
four
hours
a
day
regularly
finally
they
let
me
vaccinate
the
kids
and
the
rest
will
be
pitifully
easy
kids
always
like
me
for
some
occult
reason
and
if
the
children
cry
for
me
it
wo
be
long
till
i
got
your
whole
blooming
job
away
from
you
never
mind
though
dad
i
be
generous
and
whack
up
as
always
done
with
me
remembering
the
boyishness
of
it
anthony
dexter
smiled
a
little
and
took
another
satisfying
look
at
the
pictured
face
before
him
eyes
were
as
his
father
had
been
frank
and
friendly
and
clear
with
no
hint
of
suspicion
his
chin
was
firm
and
his
mouth
determined
but
the
corners
of
it
turned
up
decidedly
and
the
upper
lip
was
short
the
unprejudiced
observer
would
have
seen
merely
an
honest
intelligent
manly
young
fellow
who
looked
as
if
he
might
be
good
company
anthony
dexter
saw
all
this
and
a
great
deal
more
it
was
his
pride
that
he
was
unemotional
by
rigid
he
had
wholly
mastered
himself
his
detachment
from
his
kind
was
at
first
spasmodic
then
exceptionally
complete
excepting
ralph
his
relation
to
the
world
was
that
of
an
unimpassioned
critic
he
was
so
sure
of
his
own
ground
that
he
thought
he
considered
ralph
impersonally
also
over
a
nature
which
at
the
beginning
was
warmly
human
doctor
dexter
had
laid
this
glacial
mask
he
did
what
he
had
to
do
with
neatness
and
dispatch
if
an
operation
was
necessary
he
said
so
at
once
not
troubling
himself
to
approach
the
subject
gradually
if
there
was
doubt
as
to
the
outcome
he
would
cheerfully
advise
the
patient
to
make
a
will
first
but
there
was
seldom
doubt
for
those
white
blunt
fingers
were
very
sure
he
believed
in
the
sudden
stroke
and
conducted
his
life
upon
that
basis
without
so
much
as
the
quiver
of
an
eyelash
anthony
dexter
could
tell
a
man
that
within
an
hour
his
wife
would
be
dead
he
could
predict
the
death
of
a
child
almost
to
the
minute
without
a
change
in
his
expression
and
feel
a
faint
throb
of
professional
pride
when
his
prediction
was
precisely
fulfilled
the
people
feared
him
respected
him
and
admired
his
skill
but
no
one
loved
him
except
his
son
among
all
his
acquaintances
there
was
none
who
called
him
friend
except
austin
thorpe
the
old
minister
who
had
but
lately
come
to
town
this
in
itself
was
no
distinction
for
thorpe
was
the
friend
of
every
man
woman
child
and
animal
in
the
village
no
two
men
could
have
been
more
unlike
but
friendship
like
love
is
often
a
matter
of
chemical
affinity
wherein
opposites
rush
together
in
obedience
to
a
hidden
law
the
broadly
human
creed
of
the
minister
included
every
living
thing
and
the
man
himself
interested
doctor
dexter
in
much
the
same
way
that
a
new
slide
for
his
microscope
might
interest
him
they
exchanged
visits
frequently
when
the
duties
of
both
permitted
and
the
doctor
reflected
that
when
ralph
came
thorpe
would
be
lonely
the
dexter
house
was
an
old
one
but
it
had
been
kept
in
good
repair
from
time
to
time
wings
had
been
added
to
the
original
structure
until
now
it
sprawled
lazily
in
every
direction
one
wing
at
the
right
of
the
house
contained
the
doctor
medical
library
office
reception
room
and
laboratory
doors
were
arranged
in
metropolitan
fashion
so
that
patients
might
go
out
of
the
office
without
meeting
any
one
the
laboratory
at
the
back
of
the
wing
was
well
fitted
with
modern
appliances
for
original
research
and
had
too
its
own
outside
door
when
ralph
came
home
the
other
wing
at
the
left
of
the
house
was
to
be
arranged
in
like
manner
for
him
if
he
so
desired
doctor
dexter
had
some
rough
drawings
under
consideration
but
wanted
ralph
to
order
the
plans
in
accordance
with
his
own
ideas
the
breakfast
bell
rang
again
and
doctor
dexter
went
downstairs
the
servant
met
him
in
the
hall
breakfast
is
waiting
sir
she
said
all
right
returned
the
doctor
absently
i
be
there
in
a
moment
he
opened
the
door
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
immediately
perceived
the
small
purple
velvet
box
at
his
feet
he
picked
it
up
wonderingly
and
opened
it
inside
were
the
discoloured
pearls
on
their
bed
of
yellowed
satin
and
the
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
had
written
so
long
ago
in
his
clear
boyish
hand
first
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
then
from
the
depths
of
my
love
being
unemotional
he
experienced
nothing
at
first
save
natural
surprise
he
stood
there
staring
into
vacancy
idly
fingering
the
pearls
by
some
evil
magic
of
the
moment
the
hour
seemed
set
back
a
full
quarter
of
a
century
as
though
it
were
yesterday
he
saw
evelina
before
him
she
had
been
a
girl
of
extraordinary
beauty
and
charm
he
had
travelled
far
and
seen
many
but
there
had
been
none
like
evelina
how
he
had
loved
her
in
those
dead
yesterdays
and
how
she
had
loved
him
the
poignant
sweetness
of
it
came
back
changed
by
some
fatal
alchemy
into
bitterness
anthony
dexter
had
seen
enough
of
the
world
to
recognise
cowardice
when
he
saw
it
even
in
himself
his
books
had
taught
him
that
the
mind
could
hold
but
one
thought
at
a
time
and
persistently
he
had
displaced
the
unpleasant
ones
which
constantly
strove
for
the
right
of
possession
hard
work
and
new
love
and
daily
wearying
of
the
body
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
had
banished
those
phantoms
of
earlier
years
save
in
his
dreams
at
night
the
soul
claims
its
own
its
right
to
suffer
for
its
secret
sins
its
shirking
its
betrayals
it
is
not
pleasant
for
a
man
to
be
branded
in
his
own
consciousness
a
coward
refusal
to
admit
it
by
day
does
not
change
the
hour
of
the
night
when
life
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
and
sleepless
man
faces
himself
as
he
is
the
necklace
slipped
snakily
over
his
hand
one
of
those
white
firm
hands
which
could
guide
the
knife
so
well
and
anthony
dexter
shuddered
he
flung
the
box
far
from
him
into
the
shrubbery
went
back
into
the
house
and
slammed
the
door
he
sat
down
at
the
table
but
could
not
eat
the
past
had
come
from
its
grave
veiled
like
the
ghost
in
the
garden
that
he
had
seen
yesterday
it
was
not
an
hallucination
then
only
one
person
in
the
world
could
have
laid
those
discoloured
pearls
at
his
door
in
the
dead
of
night
the
black
figure
in
the
garden
with
the
chiffon
fluttering
about
its
head
was
evelina
grey
or
what
was
left
of
her
why
he
questioned
uneasily
of
himself
why
he
had
repeatedly
told
himself
that
any
other
man
in
his
position
would
do
as
he
had
done
yet
it
was
as
though
some
one
had
slipped
a
stiletto
under
his
armour
and
found
a
vulnerable
spot
before
his
mental
vision
hovered
two
women
one
was
a
girl
of
twenty
laughing
exquisitely
lovely
the
other
was
a
bent
and
broken
woman
in
black
whose
veil
concealed
the
dreadful
hideousness
of
her
face
pshaw
grumbled
doctor
dexter
aloud
i
overworked
that
all
he
determined
to
vanquish
the
spectre
that
had
reared
itself
before
him
not
perceiving
that
remorse
incarnate
in
the
shape
of
evelina
had
come
back
to
haunt
him
until
his
dying
day
v
araminta
araminta
said
miss
mehitable
go
and
get
your
sewing
and
do
your
stent
yes
aunt
hitty
answered
the
girl
obediently
each
year
araminta
made
a
new
patchwork
quilt
seven
were
neatly
folded
and
put
away
in
an
old
trunk
in
the
attic
the
eighth
was
progressing
well
but
the
young
seamstress
was
becoming
sated
with
quilts
she
had
never
been
to
school
but
miss
mehitable
had
taught
her
all
she
knew
unkind
critics
might
have
intimated
that
araminta
had
not
been
taught
much
but
she
could
sew
nicely
keep
house
neatly
and
write
a
stilted
letter
in
a
queer
hand
almost
exactly
like
miss
mehitable
that
valiant
dame
saw
no
practical
use
in
further
knowledge
she
was
concerned
with
no
books
except
the
bible
and
the
ancient
ledger
in
which
with
painstaking
exactness
she
kept
her
household
accounts
she
deemed
it
wise
moreover
that
araminta
should
not
know
too
much
from
a
drawer
in
the
high
bureau
in
the
upper
hall
araminta
drew
forth
an
assortment
of
red
white
and
blue
cotton
squares
and
diamonds
this
was
to
be
a
patriotic
quilt
made
after
a
famous
old
pattern
which
miss
hitty
had
selfishly
refused
to
give
to
any
one
else
though
she
had
often
been
asked
for
it
by
contemporary
ladies
of
similar
interests
the
younger
generation
was
inclined
to
scout
at
and
needlework
heresy
was
rampant
in
the
neighbourhood
tatting
crocheting
and
knitting
were
on
the
wane
an
advanced
woman
who
had
once
spent
a
summer
in
the
village
had
spread
abroad
the
delights
of
battenberg
and
raised
embroidery
at
all
of
these
miss
hitty
sniffed
contemptuously
quilt
makin
was
good
enough
for
their
mas
and
their
grandmas
she
said
scornfully
and
i
reckon
it
good
enough
for
anybody
else
i
no
patience
with
such
things
araminta
knew
that
she
had
never
forgotten
the
vial
of
wrath
which
broke
upon
her
luckless
head
the
day
she
had
timorously
suggested
making
lace
as
a
pleasing
change
from
unending
quilts
she
sat
now
in
a
low
rocker
by
the
window
with
one
foot
upon
a
wobbly
stool
a
marvellous
cover
of
aunt
hitty
making
which
dated
back
to
her
frivolous
and
girlish
days
was
underneath
nobody
ever
saw
it
however
and
the
gaudy
woollen
roses
blushed
unseen
a
white
linen
cover
severely
plain
was
put
upon
the
footstool
every
wednesday
and
every
saturday
year
in
and
year
out
unlike
most
good
housewives
miss
mehitable
used
her
parlour
every
day
in
the
week
she
was
obliged
to
in
fact
for
it
was
the
only
room
in
her
house
except
thorpe
which
commanded
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
crossroads
a
cover
of
brown
denim
protected
the
carpet
and
the
chairs
were
shrouded
in
shapeless
habiliments
of
cambric
and
calico
for
the
rest
however
the
room
was
mildly
cheerful
and
had
a
habitable
look
which
was
distinctly
uncommon
in
village
parlours
there
was
a
fireplace
which
was
dusted
and
scrubbed
at
intervals
but
never
under
any
circumstances
profaned
by
a
fire
it
was
curtained
by
a
gay
remnant
of
figured
plush
however
so
nobody
missed
the
fire
white
and
gold
china
vases
stood
on
the
mantel
and
a
little
china
dog
who
would
never
have
dared
to
bark
had
he
been
alive
so
chaste
and
humble
of
countenance
was
he
sat
forever
between
the
two
vases
keeping
faithful
guard
over
miss
treasures
the
silver
coffin
plates
of
the
smiths
matted
with
black
and
deeply
framed
occupied
the
place
of
honour
over
the
mantel
on
the
table
in
the
exact
centre
of
the
room
was
a
basket
of
wax
flowers
and
fruit
covered
by
a
glass
shade
miss
hitty
album
and
her
bible
were
placed
near
it
with
mathematical
precision
on
the
opposite
wall
was
a
hair
wreath
made
from
the
shorn
locks
of
departed
smiths
by
miss
hitty
mother
the
proud
possessor
felt
a
covert
reproach
in
the
fact
that
she
herself
was
unable
to
make
hair
wreaths
it
was
a
talent
for
which
she
had
great
admiration
araminta
rocked
back
and
forth
in
her
low
chair
by
the
window
she
hummed
a
bit
of
sweet
bye
and
bye
to
herself
for
hymns
were
the
only
songs
she
knew
she
could
play
some
of
them
with
one
hand
on
the
melodeon
in
the
corner
but
she
dared
not
touch
the
yellow
keys
of
the
venerated
instrument
except
when
miss
hitty
was
out
the
sunlight
shone
lovingly
on
araminta
brown
hair
tightly
combed
back
braided
and
pinned
up
but
rippling
riotously
none
the
less
her
deep
thoughtful
eyes
were
grey
and
her
nose
turned
up
coquettishly
to
a
guardian
of
greater
penetration
araminta
mouth
would
have
given
deep
concern
it
was
a
demure
rosy
mouth
warning
and
tantalising
by
turns
mischievous
little
dimples
lurked
in
the
corners
of
it
and
even
aunt
hitty
was
not
proof
against
the
magic
of
araminta
smile
the
girl
face
had
the
creamy
softness
of
a
white
rose
petal
but
her
cheeks
bloomed
with
the
flush
of
health
and
she
had
a
most
disconcerting
trick
of
blushing
with
spartan
thoroughness
miss
mehitable
constantly
strove
to
cure
araminta
of
this
distressing
fault
but
as
yet
she
had
not
succeeded
the
pretty
child
had
grown
into
an
exquisitely
lovely
woman
to
her
stern
guardian
secret
uneasiness
it
goin
to
be
harder
to
keep
minty
right
than
would
be
if
she
was
plain
mused
miss
hitty
but
t
guess
i
be
given
strength
to
do
it
i
done
well
by
her
so
far
in
the
sweet
bye
and
bye
sang
araminta
in
a
piping
girlish
soprano
we
shall
meet
on
that
beautiful
shore
maybe
we
shall
and
maybe
we
said
miss
hitty
grimly
some
folks
never
see
the
beautiful
shore
they
go
to
the
bad
place
araminta
lifted
her
great
grey
questioning
eyes
why
she
asked
simply
because
they
been
bad
answered
miss
hitty
defiantly
but
if
they
did
know
any
better
queried
araminta
threading
her
needle
would
they
go
to
the
bad
place
just
because
they
know
miss
mehitable
squirmed
in
her
chair
for
never
before
had
araminta
spoken
thus
there
no
excuse
for
their
not
knowin
she
said
sharply
perhaps
not
sighed
araminta
but
it
seems
dreadful
to
think
of
people
being
burned
up
just
for
ignorance
do
you
think
i
be
burned
up
aunt
hitty
she
continued
anxiously
there
so
many
things
i
do
know
miss
mehitable
set
herself
firmly
to
her
task
araminta
lee
she
said
harshly
do
get
to
bothering
about
what
you
do
know
that
the
sure
way
to
perdition
i
told
you
time
and
time
again
what
right
for
you
to
believe
and
what
right
for
you
to
do
you
walk
in
that
path
and
turn
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
and
you
wo
have
no
trouble
here
or
anywheres
else
yes
aunt
hitty
said
the
girl
dutifully
it
must
be
awful
to
be
burned
miss
mehitable
looked
about
her
furtively
then
drew
her
chair
closer
to
araminta
that
brings
to
my
mind
something
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
and
i
do
know
but
what
this
is
as
good
a
chance
as
any
you
know
where
i
told
you
to
go
the
other
day
with
the
tray
and
to
set
it
down
at
the
back
door
and
rap
and
run
yes
araminta
eyes
were
wide
open
now
she
had
wondered
much
at
her
mysterious
errand
but
had
not
dared
to
ask
questions
well
continued
aunt
hitty
after
an
aggravating
pause
the
woman
that
lives
in
that
house
has
been
burnt
araminta
gasped
oh
aunt
hitty
was
she
bad
what
did
she
do
and
how
did
she
get
burned
before
she
was
dead
miss
mehitable
brushed
aside
the
question
as
though
it
were
an
annoying
fly
i
do
want
it
talked
of
she
said
severely
evelina
grey
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
she
is
yet
if
anything
on
earth
i
despise
it
a
gossip
people
who
anything
better
to
do
than
to
go
around
prying
into
other
affairs
are
better
off
dead
i
take
it
my
mother
never
permitted
me
to
gossip
and
i
held
true
to
her
teachin
aunt
hitty
smoothed
her
skirts
with
superior
virtue
and
tied
a
knot
in
her
thread
how
did
she
get
burned
asked
araminta
eagerly
gossip
said
miss
mehitable
sententiously
does
a
lot
of
harm
and
makes
a
lot
of
folks
miserable
it
a
good
thing
to
keep
away
from
and
if
i
ever
hear
of
your
gossiping
about
anybody
i
shut
you
up
in
your
room
for
two
weeks
and
keep
you
on
bread
and
water
araminta
trembled
what
is
gossiping
aunt
hitty
she
asked
in
a
timid
tone
talking
about
folks
explained
miss
hitty
tellin
things
about
they
would
tell
themselves
it
occurred
to
araminta
that
much
of
the
conversation
at
the
crossroads
might
appropriately
be
classed
under
that
head
but
of
course
aunt
hitty
knew
what
she
was
talking
about
she
remembered
the
last
quilting
aunt
hitty
had
given
when
the
ladies
aid
society
had
been
invited
en
masse
to
finish
off
the
quilt
rebellious
fingers
had
just
completed
one
of
the
ladies
had
been
obliged
to
leave
earlier
than
the
rest
and
i
do
believe
thought
araminta
that
gardner
would
have
told
how
her
son
ran
away
from
home
nor
that
she
did
dust
her
bed
slats
except
at
time
nor
that
they
ate
things
other
people
would
give
to
the
pigs
i
expect
there
be
a
lot
of
questions
asked
about
evelina
observed
miss
mehitable
breaking
in
rudely
upon
araminta
train
of
thought
as
soon
folks
finds
out
she
come
back
to
live
here
and
that
she
has
to
wear
a
veil
all
the
time
even
when
she
wear
her
hat
what
i
telling
you
for
is
to
show
you
what
happens
to
women
that
have
sense
enough
to
keep
away
from
men
if
evelina
kept
away
from
doctor
dexter
she
would
have
got
burnt
did
doctor
dexter
burn
her
asked
araminta
breathlessly
i
thought
it
was
god
at
the
psychological
moment
doctor
dexter
drove
by
bowing
to
miss
mehitable
as
he
passed
araminta
had
observed
that
this
particular
event
always
flustered
her
aunt
maybe
it
was
god
and
maybe
it
was
doctor
dexter
answered
miss
mehitable
quickly
that
something
there
do
nobody
know
except
evelina
and
doctor
dexter
and
it
not
for
me
to
ask
either
one
of
though
i
do
doubt
some
of
the
sewin
society
make
an
errand
to
evelina
to
find
out
i
got
to
keep
off
her
if
i
can
and
that
a
big
job
for
one
woman
to
tackle
anyhow
she
got
burnt
and
got
burnt
awful
and
it
was
at
his
house
that
it
happened
it
was
shameless
the
way
evelina
carried
on
why
if
you
believe
me
she
actually
go
to
his
house
when
there
no
need
of
it
nobody
sick
nor
no
medicine
to
be
bought
nor
anything
some
said
they
was
goin
to
be
married
the
scorn
which
miss
mehitable
managed
to
throw
into
the
word
married
indicated
that
the
state
was
the
crowning
ignominy
of
the
race
the
girl
cheek
flamed
into
crimson
for
her
own
mother
had
been
married
and
everybody
knew
it
sometimes
the
deep
disgrace
seemed
almost
too
much
for
araminta
to
endure
that
what
comes
of
it
explained
miss
hitty
patiently
as
a
teacher
might
point
to
a
demonstration
clearly
made
out
on
a
blackboard
for
an
eager
class
if
she
stayed
at
home
as
a
girl
should
stay
and
had
gone
to
doctor
dexter
she
would
have
got
burnt
anybody
can
see
that
there
was
so
much
goin
on
at
the
time
that
i
sorter
lost
track
of
everything
otherwise
i
have
known
more
about
it
but
i
guess
i
know
as
much
as
anybody
ever
knew
evelina
was
to
doctor
dexter
shameless
hussy
that
she
was
and
she
got
burnt
she
was
there
all
the
afternoon
and
they
took
her
to
the
hospital
in
the
city
on
the
night
train
and
she
stayed
there
until
she
was
well
but
she
never
came
back
here
until
just
now
her
mother
went
with
her
to
take
care
of
her
and
before
evelina
came
out
of
the
hospital
her
mother
keeled
over
and
died
sarah
grey
always
had
a
weak
heart
and
a
weak
head
to
match
it
if
she
had
have
had
she
have
brought
up
evelina
different
neither
of
was
ever
in
the
house
again
neither
one
ever
came
back
even
for
their
clothes
they
had
plenty
of
money
then
and
they
just
bought
new
ones
when
the
word
come
that
evelina
was
burnt
sarah
grey
just
put
on
her
hat
and
locked
her
doors
and
run
up
to
doctor
dexter
nobody
ever
heard
from
them
again
until
jim
gardner
second
cousin
on
his
father
side
sent
a
paper
with
sarah
grey
obituary
in
it
and
now
after
years
come
back
the
poor
soul
just
sittin
there
in
all
the
dust
and
cobwebs
when
i
get
time
i
aim
to
go
over
there
and
clean
up
the
house
for
her
ai
decent
for
a
body
to
live
like
that
i
take
you
with
me
to
help
scrub
and
what
i
telling
you
all
this
for
is
so
you
wo
ask
any
questions
nor
act
as
if
you
thought
it
was
queer
for
a
woman
to
wear
a
white
veil
all
the
time
you
have
to
act
as
if
nothing
was
out
of
the
way
at
all
and
not
look
at
her
any
more
than
you
can
help
just
pretend
it
the
style
to
wear
a
veil
pinned
to
your
hair
all
the
time
and
you
been
wearin
one
right
along
and
have
forgot
and
left
it
to
home
do
you
understand
me
yes
aunt
hitty
and
when
people
come
here
to
find
out
about
it
you
not
to
say
anything
leave
it
all
to
me
ai
necessary
for
you
to
lie
but
you
can
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
i
hope
you
see
now
what
it
means
to
a
woman
to
walk
straight
on
her
own
path
that
the
lord
has
laid
out
for
her
and
to
let
men
alone
they
pizen
every
one
of
araminta
sat
in
her
chair
and
sewed
steadily
at
her
dainty
seam
but
none
the
less
she
was
deeply
stirred
with
pity
for
women
who
so
forgot
themselves
who
had
not
aunt
hitty
superior
wisdom
at
the
end
of
the
prayer
which
miss
mehitable
had
taught
the
child
and
which
the
woman
still
repeated
in
her
nightly
devotions
was
this
eloquent
passage
and
oh
lord
keep
me
from
the
contamination
of
marriage
for
thy
sake
amen
araminta
said
aunt
hitty
severely
cover
up
your
foot
modestly
araminta
drew
down
her
skirt
one
foot
was
on
the
immaculate
footstool
and
her
ankle
was
exposed
to
view
a
lovely
ankle
in
spite
of
the
shoes
which
she
always
wore
how
often
have
i
told
you
to
keep
your
ankles
covered
demanded
miss
mehitable
suppose
the
minister
had
come
in
suddenly
suppose
upon
my
word
speakin
of
angels
if
there
ai
the
minister
now
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
came
slowly
up
the
path
his
head
bowed
in
thought
he
was
painfully
but
he
refused
to
wear
glasses
on
the
doorstep
he
paused
and
wiped
his
feet
upon
the
mat
until
even
miss
mehitable
beaming
at
him
through
the
window
thought
he
was
overdoing
it
unconsciously
she
took
credit
to
herself
for
the
minister
neatness
stepping
carefully
lest
he
profane
the
hall
carpet
by
wandering
off
the
rug
the
minister
entered
the
parlour
having
first
taken
off
his
coat
and
hat
and
hung
them
upon
their
appointed
hooks
in
the
hall
it
was
cold
and
the
cheery
warmth
of
the
room
beckoned
him
in
he
did
not
know
that
he
tried
miss
hitty
by
trespassing
so
to
speak
upon
her
preserves
she
would
have
been
better
pleased
if
he
remained
in
his
room
when
he
was
not
at
the
table
or
out
but
to
do
him
justice
the
reverend
gentleman
did
not
often
offend
her
thus
araminta
blushing
took
her
foot
from
the
footstool
and
pulled
feverishly
at
her
skirts
as
thorpe
entered
the
room
she
did
not
look
up
but
kept
her
eyes
modestly
upon
her
work
there
ai
no
need
to
tear
out
the
gathers
miss
hitty
said
in
a
warning
undertone
referring
to
aramlnta
skirts
why
thorpe
how
you
surprised
me
come
in
and
set
a
spell
she
added
grudgingly
steering
well
away
from
the
with
its
highly
prized
ornament
thorpe
gained
the
chair
in
which
if
he
did
not
lean
against
the
tidy
he
was
permitted
to
sit
he
held
himself
bolt
upright
and
warmed
his
hands
at
the
stove
it
is
good
to
be
out
he
said
cheerfully
and
good
to
come
in
again
a
day
like
this
makes
one
appreciate
the
blessing
of
a
home
miss
hitty
watched
the
inoffensive
old
man
with
the
keen
scrutiny
of
an
eagle
guarding
its
nest
he
did
not
lean
upon
the
tidy
nor
rest
his
elbows
upon
the
crocheted
mats
which
protected
the
arms
of
the
chair
in
short
he
conducted
himself
as
a
gentleman
should
when
in
the
parlour
of
a
lady
his
blue
eyes
rested
approvingly
upon
araminta
how
the
child
grows
he
said
with
a
friendly
smile
upon
his
kindly
old
face
soon
we
shall
have
a
young
lady
on
our
hands

bent
more
closely
to
her

i
hope
i
not
annoying
you
questioned
the
minister
after
an
interval
not
at
all
said
miss
mehitable
politely
i
wanted
to
ask
about
some
one
pursued
the
reverend
thorpe
it
seems
that
there
is
a
new
tenant
in
the
old
house
on
the
hill
that
has
been
empty
for
so
long
the
one
the
village
people
say
is
haunted
it
seems
a
woman
is
living
there
quite
alone
and
she
always
wears
a
veil
on
account
of
some
some
disfigurement
miss
hitty
false
teeth
clicked
sharply
but
there
was
no
other
sound
except
the
clock
which
in
the
pause
struck
four
i
thought
continued
the
minister
with
a
rising
inflection
hitherto
he
had
found
his
hostess
of
invaluable
assistance
in
his
parish
work
it
had
been
necessary
to
mention
only
the
name
as
upon
the
turning
of
a
faucet
a
stream
of
information
gushed
forth
from
the
fountain
of
her
knowledge
age
date
and
place
of

on
both
sides

and
a
vast
amount
of
other
personal
data
had
been
immediately
forthcoming
tagged
to
it
like
the
postscript
of
a

letter
was
miss
hitty
own
concise
permanent
neatly
labelled
opinion
of
the
family
or
individual
the
latter
thrown
in
without
extra
charge
perhaps
you
did
know
remarked
the
minister
that
such
a
woman
had
come
his
tone
was
inquiring
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
must
be
wrong
if
she
did
not
know
minty
said
miss
hitty
abruptly
leave
the
room
araminta
rose
gathered
up
her
patchwork
and
went
out
carefully
closing
the
door
it
was
only
in
moments
of
great
tenderness
that
her
aunt
called
her
minty
the
light
footsteps
died
away
upon
the
stairs
tactlessly
the
minister
persisted
do
you
know
he
asked
miss
mehitable
turned
upon
him
if
i
did
she
replied
hotly
i
would
tell
any
prying
gossiping
man
i
never
knew
before
it
was
part
of
a
minister
business
to
meddle
in
folks
private
affairs
you
better
be
writing
your
sermon
and
studyin
up
on
hell
i
i
stammered
the
minister
taken
wholly
by
surprise
i
only
hoped
to
give
her
the
consolation
of
the
church
consolation
nothing
snorted
miss
hitty
let
her
alone
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
furiously
leaving
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
overcome
with
deep
and
lasting
amazement
vi
pipes
o
pan
sleet
had
fallen
in
the
night
but
at
sunrise
the
storm
ceased
miss
evelina
had
gone
to
sleep
lulled
into
a
sense
of
security
by
the
icy
fingers
tapping
at
her
cobwebbed
window
pane
she
awoke
in
a
transfigured
world
every
branch
and
twig
was
encased
in
crystal
upon
which
the
sun
was
dazzling
jewels
poised
in
midair
twinkled
with
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
on
the
tip
of
the
cypress
at
the
gate
was
a
ruby
a
sapphire
gleamed
from
the
and
everywhere
were
diamonds
and
pearls
frosty
vapour
veiled
the
spaces
between
the
trees
and
javelins
of
sunlight
pierced
it
here
and
there
beyond
there
were
glimpses
of
blue
sky
and
drops
of
water
falling
from
the
trees
made
a
musical
cadence
upon
the
earth
beneath
miss
evelina
opened
her
window
still
more
the
air
was
peculiarly
soft
and
sweet
it
had
the
fragrance
of
opening
buds
and
growing
things
and
still
had
not
lost
the
tang
of
the
frost
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
it
and
straightway
was
uplifted
though
seemingly
against
her
will
spring
was
stirring
at
the
heart
of
the
world
sending
new
currents
of
sap
into
the
veins
of
the
trees
new
aspirations
into
dead
roots
and
fibres
fresh
hopes
of
bloom
into
every
sleeping
rose
life
incarnate
knocked
at
the
wintry
tomb
eager
unseen
hands
were
rolling
away
the
stone
the
tide
of
the
year
was
rising
soon
to
break
into
the
wonder
of
green
boughs
and
violets
shimmering
wings
and
singing
winds
the
cold
hand
that
clutched
her
heart
took
a
firmer
hold
with
acute
she
perceived
her
isolation
of
all
the
world
she
alone
was
set
apart
branded
scarred
locked
in
a
prison
house
that
had
no
door
the
one
release
was
denied
her
until
she
could
get
away
poverty
had
driven
her
back
circumstances
outside
her
control
had
pushed
her
through
the
door
she
had
thought
never
to
enter
again
through
all
the
years
she
had
thought
of
the
house
with
a
shudder
peopling
it
with
a
thousand
terrors
not
knowing
that
there
was
no
terror
save
her
own
fear
sorrow
had
put
its
chains
upon
her
suddenly
at
a
time
when
she
had
not
the
strength
to
break
the
bond
at
first
she
had
struggled
then
ceased
since
then
her
faculties
had
been
in
suspense
as
it
were
she
had
forgotten
laughter
veiled
herself
from
joy
and
walked
hand
in
hand
with
the
grisly
phantom
of
her
own
conjuring
behind
the
shelter
of
her
veil
she
had
mutely
prayed
for
peace
she
dared
not
ask
for
more
and
peace
had
never
come
her
crowning
humiliation
would
be
to
meet
anthony
dexter
face
to
face
to
know
him
and
to
have
him
know
her
not
knowing
where
he
was
she
had
travelled
far
to
avoid
him
now
seeking
the
last
refuge
the
one
place
on
earth
where
he
could
not
be
she
found
herself
separated
from
him
by
less
than
a
mile
more
than
that
she
had
gone
to
his
house
as
she
had
gone
on
the
fateful
day
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
she
had
taken
back
the
pearls
and
had
not
died
in
doing
it
strangely
enough
it
had
given
her
a
vague
relief
miss
evelina
mind
had
paused
at
twenty
she
had
not
grown
the
acute
suffering
of
youth
was
still
upon
her
a
woman
of
it
was
as
though
a
clock
had
gone
on
ticking
and
the
hands
had
never
moved
the
dial
of
her
being
was
held
at
that
dread
hour
while
her
broken
heart
beat
on
she
had
not
discovered
that
secret
compensation
which
clings
to
the
commonest
affairs
of
life
one
sees
before
him
a
mountain
of
toil
an
apparently
endless
drudgery
from
which
there
is
no
escape
having
once
begun
it
an
interest
appears
unexpectedly
new
forces
ally
themselves
with
the
fumbling
hands
misfortunes
come
not
singly
but
in
battalions
after
the
first
shock
of
realisation
one
perceives
through
the
darkness
that
the
strength
to
bear
them
has
come
also
like
some
good
angel
a
lover
shudders
at
the
thought
of
death
yet
knows
that
some
day
on
the
road
they
walk
together
the
grey
angel
with
the
white
poppies
will
surely
take
one
of
them
by
the
hand
the
road
winds
through
shadows
past
many
strange
and
difficult
places
and
wrecks
are
strewn
all
along
the
way
they
laugh
at
the
storms
that
beat
upon
them
take
no
reck
of
bruised
feet
nor
stumbling
for
behold
they
are
together
and
in
that
one
word
lies
all
sometimes
in
the
mist
ahead
which
as
they
enter
it
is
seen
to
be
wholly
of
tears
the
road
forks
blindly
and
there
is
nothing
but
night
ahead
for
each
the
grey
angel
with
the
unfathomable
eyes
approaches
slowly
with
no
sound
save
the
hushed
murmur
of
wings
the
dread
white
poppies
are
in
his
outstretched
hand
the
great
nodding
white
poppies
which
have
come
from
the
dank
places
and
have
never
known
the
sun
there
is
no
possible
denial
at
first
one
knows
only
that
the
faithful
hand
has
grown
cold
then
that
it
has
unclasped
in
the
intolerable
darkness
one
fares
forth
alone
on
the
other
fork
of
the
road
too
stricken
for
tears
at
length
there
is
a
change
memories
troop
from
the
shadow
to
whisper
consolation
to
say
that
death
himself
is
powerless
against
love
when
a
heart
is
deep
enough
to
hold
a
grave
the
clouds
lift
and
through
the
night
comes
some
stray
gleam
of
dawn
no
longer
cold
the
dear
hand
nestles
once
more
into
the
one
that
held
it
so
long
not
as
an
uncertain
presence
but
as
a
loved
reality
that
other
abides
with
him
still
shut
out
forever
from
the
possibility
of
estrangement
for
there
is
always
that
drop
of
bitterness
in
the
cup
of
life
and
love
eternally
beyond
the
reach
of
misunderstanding
or
change
spared
the
pitfalls
and
disasters
of
the
way
ahead
blinded
no
longer
by
the
mists
of
earth
but
immortally
and
unchangeably
his
that
other
fares
with
him
though
unseen
upon
the
selfsame
road
from
the
broken
night
comes
singing
for
the
white
poppies
have
also
brought
balm
step
by
step
his
sorrow
has
become
his
friend
and
at
the
last
when
the
old
feet
are
weary
and
the
steep
road
has
grown
still
more
steep
the
grey
angel
comes
once
more
past
the
mist
of
tears
in
which
he
once
was
shrouded
the
face
of
the
grey
angel
is
seen
to
be
wondrously
kind
by
his
mysterious
alchemy
he
has
crystallised
the
doubtful
waters
which
once
were
in
the
cup
of
life
and
love
into
a
jewel
which
has
no
flaw
he
has
kept
the
child
forever
a
child
caught
the
maiden
at
the
noon
of
her
beauty
to
enshrine
her
thus
for
always
in
the
heart
that
loved
her
most
made
the
true
and
loving
comrade
a
comrade
always
though
on
the
highways
of
the
vast
unknown
it
is
seen
now
that
the
road
has
many
windings
and
that
unconsciously
the
wayfarer
has
turned
back
eagerly
the
trembling
hands
reach
forward
to
take
the
white
poppies
and
the
tired
eyes
close
as
though
the
silken
petals
had
already
fluttered
downward
on
the
lids
for
radiant
past
all
believing
the
grey
angel
still
holds
the
best
beloved
by
the
hand
and
the
roads
that
long
ago
had
forked
in
darkness
have
come
together
in
more
than
mortal
dawn
at
the
selfsame
place
upon
the
beauty
of
the
crystalline
march
morning
the
memory
of
the
winter
sorrow
still
lay
the
bare
brown
earth
was
not
wholly
hidden
by
the
mantle
of
sleet
and
snow
yet
there
was
some
intangible
easter
close
at
hand
miss
evelina
felt
it
stricken
though
she
was
from
a
distant
thicket
came
a
robin
cheery
call
a
glimmer
of
blue
wings
flashed
across
the
desolate
garden
a
south
wind
stirred
the
bending
icy
branches
to
a
tinkling
music
and
she
knew
that
spring
had
come
to
all
but
her
some
indefinite
impulse
sent
her
outdoors
closely
veiled
she
started
off
down
the
road
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
miss
hitty
saw
her
pass
but
graciously
forbore
to
call
to
her
araminta
looked
up
enquiringly
from
her
sewing
but
the
question
died
on
her
lips
down
through
the
village
she
went
across
the
tracks
and
up
to
the
river
road
it
had
been
a
favourite
walk
of
hers
in
her
girlhood
then
she
had
gone
with
a
quick
light
step
now
she
went
slowly
like
one
grown
old
yet
all
unconsciously
life
was
quickening
in
her
pulses
the
old
magic
of
spring
was
stirring
in
her
too
dark
and
deep
the
waters
of
the
river
rolled
dreamily
by
waiting
for
the
impulse
which
should
send
the
shallows
singing
to
the
sea
and
stir
the
depths
to
a
low
murmurous
symphony
upon
the
left
as
she
walked
the
road
was
bordered
with
elms
and
maples
stretching
far
back
to
the
hills
the
woods
were
full
of
unsuspected
ravines
and
hollows
queer
winding
paths
great
rocks
and
tiny
streams
the
children
had
called
it
the
enchanted
forest
and
played
that
a
fairy
prince
and
princess
dwelt
therein
the
childhood
memories
came
back
to
evelina
with
a
pang
she
stopped
to
wipe
away
the
tears
beneath
her
veil
to
choke
back
a
sob
that
tightened
her
throat
suddenly
she
felt
a
presentiment
of
oncoming
evil
a
rushing
destiny
that
could
not
be
swerved
aside
frightened
she
turned
to
go
back
then
stopped
again
from
above
on
the
upper
part
of
the
road
came
the
tread
of
feet
and
the
murmur
of
wheels
her
face
paled
to
marble
her
feet
refused
to
move
the
heart
within
her
stood
portentously
still
with
downcast
eyes
she
stood
there
petrified
motionless
like
a
woman
carved
in
stone
and
clothed
in
black
veiled
impenetrably
in
chiffon
at
a
furious
pace
anthony
dexter
dashed
by
his
face
as
white
as
her
chiffon
she
had
known
unerringly
who
was
coming
and
had
felt
the
searing
consciousness
of
his
single
glance
before
with
a
muttered
oath
he
had
lashed
his
horse
to
a
gallop
this
then
was
the
last
there
was
nothing
more
the
sound
of
the
wheels
died
away
in
the
distance
he
had
the
pearls
he
had
seen
her
he
knew
that
she
had
come
back
and
still
she
lived
clear
and
high
like
a
bugle
call
a
strain
of
wild
music
came
from
the
enchanted
forest
evelina
threw
back
her
head
gasping
for
breath
her
sluggish
feet
stirred
forward
some
forgotten
valour
of
her
spirit
leaped
to
answer
the
summons
as
a
soldier
wounded
unto
death
turns
to
follow
the
singing
trumpets
that
lead
the
charge
strangely
soft
and
tender
the
strain
came
again
less
militant
less
challenging
swiftly
upon
its
echo
breathed
another
hinting
of
peace
shaken
to
her
inmost
soul
by
agony
she
took
heed
of
the
music
with
the
precise
consciousness
one
gives
to
trifles
at
moments
of
unendurable
stress
blindly
she
turned
into
the
forest
what
was
it
she
asked
herself
repeatedly
wondering
that
she
could
even
hear
at
a
time
like
this
a
bird
no
there
was
never
a
bird
to
sing
like
that
almost
it
might
be
pan
himself
with
his
syrinx
walking
abroad
on
the
first
day
of
spring
the
fancy
appealed
to
her
strongly
her
swirling
senses
having
become
exquisitely
acute
pipes
o
pan
she
whispered
i
will
find
and
follow
you
to
see
the
face
of
pan
meant
death
according
to
the
old
greek
legend
but
death
was
something
of
which
she
was
not
afraid
lyric
tremulous
softly
appealing
the
music
came
again
the
bare
boughs
bent
with
their
chiming
crystal
and
a
twig
fell
at
her
feet
sunlight
starred
the
misty
distance
with
pearl
shining
branches
swayed
to
meet
her
as
she
passed
farther
in
the
wood
she
turned
unconsciously
in
pursuit
of
that
of
sound
here
and
there
out
of
the
silence
it
came
to
startle
her
to
fill
her
with
strange
forebodings
which
were
not
wholly
of
pain
some
subliminal
self
guided
her
for
heart
and
soul
were
merged
in
a
quivering
ecstasy
of
torture
which
throbbed
and
thundered
and
overflowed
he
saw
me
he
saw
me
he
saw
me
he
knew
me
he
knew
me
he
knew
me
in
a
triple
rhythm
the
words
vibrated
back
and
forth
unceasingly
as
though
upon
a
weaver
shuttle
for
nearly
an
hour
she
went
blindly
in
search
of
the
music
pausing
now
and
then
to
listen
intently
at
times
disheartened
enough
to
turn
back
she
had
a
mad
fancy
that
death
was
calling
her
from
some
far
height
because
anthony
dexter
had
passed
her
on
the
road
now
and
commanding
now
tender
and
appealing
the
mystic
music
danced
about
her
capriciously
her
feet
grew
weary
but
the
blood
and
the
love
of
life
had
begun
to
move
in
her
too
when
her
whole
nature
was
unspeakably
stirred
she
paused
and
leaned
against
a
tree
to
listen
for
the
pipes
o
pan
but
all
was
silent
the
white
stillness
of
the
enchanted
forest
was
like
that
of
another
world
with
a
sigh
she
turned
to
the
left
reflecting
that
a
long
walk
straight
through
the
woods
would
bring
her
out
on
the
other
road
at
a
point
near
her
own
home
exquisitely
faint
and
tender
the
call
rang
out
again
it
was
like
some
far
flute
of
april
blown
in
a
march
dawn
oh
pipes
o
pan
breathed
evelina
behind
her
shielding
veil
i
pray
you
find
me
i
pray
you
give
me
joy
or
death
swiftly
the
music
answered
like
a
trumpet
chanting
from
a
height
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
she
began
to
climb
the
hill
it
was
a
more
difficult
way
but
a
nearer
one
for
just
beyond
the
hill
was
her
house
up
the
ascent
the
hill
sloped
back
there
was
a
small
level
place
where
one
might
rest
before
going
on
to
the
summit
it
was
not
more
than
a
little
nook
surrounded
by
pines
as
she
came
to
it
there
was
a
frightened
chirp
and
a
flock
of
birds
fluttered
up
from
her
feet
leaving
a
generous
supply
of
crumbs
and
grain
spread
upon
the
earth
against
a
great
tree
leaned
a
man
so
brown
and
shaggy
in
his
short
coat
that
he
seemed
like
part
of
the
tree
trunk
he
was
of
medium
height
wore
high
leather
gaiters
and
a
grey
felt
hat
with
a
long
red
quill
thrust
rakishly
through
the
band
his
face
was
round
and
rosy
and
the
kindest
eyes
in
the
world
twinkled
at
evelina
from
beneath
his
bushy
eyebrows
at
his
feet
quietly
happy
was
a
yellow
mongrel
with
a
stubby
tail
which
wagged
violently
as
evelina
approached
slung
over
the
man
shoulder
by
a
cord
was
a
flute
from
his
elevated
position
he
must
have
seen
her
when
she
entered
the
wood
and
had
glimpses
of
her
at
intervals
ever
since
it
was
evident
that
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
musical
he
had
forced
her
to
play
while
he
was
feeding
the
birds
his
eyes
laughed
and
there
were
mischievous
dimples
in
his
round
rosy
cheeks
oh
cried
evelina
in
a
tone
of
dull
disappointment
i
called
you
said
the
piper
gently
and
you
came
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
walked
swiftly
away
she
went
downhill
with
more
haste
than
dignity
turned
to
her
right
and
struck
out
through
the
woods
for
the
main
road
the
piper
watched
her
until
she
was
lost
among
the
trees
the
birds
came
back
for
their
crumbs
and
grain
and
he
stood
patiently
until
his
feathered
pensioners
had
finished
and
flown
away
chirping
with
satisfaction
then
he
stooped
to
pat
the
yellow
mongrel
laddie
he
said
i
thinking
there
no
more
gypsying
for
us
just
now
we
will
not
pack
our
shop
upon
our
back
and
march
on
as
we
had
thought
to
do
some
one
needs
us
here
eh
laddie
the
dog
capered
about
his
master
feet
as
if
he
understood
and
fully
agreed
he
was
a
pitiful
sort
even
for
a
mongrel
one
of
his
legs
had
been
broken
and
unskilfully
set
so
he
did
not
run
quite
like
other
dogs
is
a
very
good
leg
laddie
the
piper
observed
but
thinking
is
better
than
none
anyway
i
did
my
best
with
it
and
now
we
push
on
a
bit
it
our
turn
to
follow
and
we
fain
laddie
you
and
i
to
see
where
she
lives
bidding
the
dog
stay
at
heel
the
piper
followed
miss
evelina
track
by
dint
of
rapid
walking
he
reached
the
main
road
shortly
after
she
did
keeping
a
respectful
distance
and
walking
at
the
side
of
the
road
he
watched
her
as
she
went
home
from
the
safe
shelter
of
a
clump
of
alders
just
below
miss
mehitable
he
saw
the
veiled
figure
enter
the
broken
gate
is
the
old
house
laddie
he
said
to
the
dog
the
very
one
we
were
thinking
of
taking
ourselves
come
on
now
we
be
going
down
sir
home
vii
the
honour
of
the
spoken
word
anthony
dexter
sat
in
his
library
alone
as
usual
under
the
lamp
ralph
letters
were
spread
out
before
him
but
he
was
not
reading
indeed
he
knew
every
line
of
them
by
heart
but
he
could
not
keep
his
mind
upon
the
letters
between
his
eyes
and
the
written
pages
there
came
persistently
a
veiled
figure
clothed
shabbily
in
sombre
black
continually
he
fancied
the
horror
the
veil
concealed
continually
out
of
the
past
his
cowardice
and
his
shirking
arose
to
confront
him
a
photograph
of
his
wife
who
had
died
soon
after
ralph
was
born
had
been
taken
from
the
drawer
a
pretty
sweet
woman
he
mused
a
good
wife
and
a
good
mother
he
told
himself
again
that
he
had
loved
her
that
he
loved
her
still
yet
behind
his
thought
was
sure
knowledge
the
woman
who
had
entered
the
secret
fastnesses
of
his
soul
and
before
whom
he
had
trembled
was
the
one
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
dead
garden
frail
as
a
ghost
and
again
on
the
road
that
morning
dimly
and
now
for
the
first
time
there
came
to
his
perception
that
recognition
of
his
mate
which
each
man
carries
in
his
secret
heart
when
he
has
found
his
mate
at
all
past
the
anguish
that
lay
between
them
like
a
sword
and
through
the
mists
of
the
estranging
years
evelina
had
come
back
to
claim
her
own
he
saw
that
they
were
bound
together
scarred
in
body
or
scarred
in
soul
crippled
mutilated
or
maimed
though
either
or
both
might
be
the
one
significant
fact
was
not
altered
he
knew
now
that
his
wife
and
the
mother
of
his
child
had
stood
outside
as
all
women
but
the
one
must
ever
stand
nor
did
he
guess
that
she
had
known
it
from
the
first
and
that
had
hastened
her
death
aside
from
a
very
gratitude
to
her
for
his
son
anthony
dexter
cherished
no
emotion
for
the
sake
of
his
dead
wife
she
had
come
and
gone
across
his
existence
as
a
butterfly
crosses
a
field
touching
lightly
here
and
there
but
lingering
not
at
all
except
for
ralph
it
was
as
though
she
had
never
been
so
little
did
she
now
exist
for
him
yet
evelina
was
vital
alive
and
out
of
the
horror
she
had
come
back
to
him
he
did
not
believe
that
she
had
come
definitely
to
seek
him
he
knew
her
pride
too
well
for
that
his
mind
strove
to
grasp
the
reason
of
her
coming
but
it
eluded
him
evaded
him
at
every
point
she
had
not
forgotten
if
she
had
she
would
not
have
given
back
that
sinuous
necklace
of
discoloured
pearls
by
the
way
what
had
he
done
with
the
necklace
he
remembered
now
he
had
thrown
it
far
into
the
shrubbery
for
the
pearls
were
dead
and
the
love
was
dead
first
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
then
from
the
depths
of
my
love
the
mocking
words
written
in
faded
ink
on
the
yellowed
slip
of
paper
danced
impishly
across
the
pages
of
ralph
letters
he
had
a
curious
fancy
that
if
his
love
had
been
deep
enough
the
pearls
would
not
have
turned
black
impatiently
he
rose
from
the
table
and
paced
back
and
forth
restlessly
across
the
library
i
a
fool
he
growled
a
doddering
old
fool
no
that
not
it
i
worked
too
hard
valiantly
he
strove
to
dispel
the
phantoms
that
clustered
about
him
a
light
step
behind
him
chimed
in
with
his
as
he
walked
and
he
feared
to
look
around
not
knowing
it
was
but
the
echo
of
his
own
he
went
to
a
desk
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
opened
a
secret
drawer
that
had
not
been
opened
for
a
long
time
he
took
out
a
photograph
wrapped
in
yellowed
tissue
paper
and
went
back
to
the
table
he
unwrapped
it
his
blunt
white
fingers
trembling
ever
so
slightly
and
sat
down
a
face
of
surpassing
loveliness
looked
back
at
him
it
was
evelina
at
the
noon
of
her
girlish
beauty
her
face
alight
with
love
anthony
dexter
looked
long
at
the
perfect
features
the
warm
sweet
tempting
mouth
the
great
trusting
eyes
and
the
brown
hair
that
waved
so
softly
back
from
her
face
the
and
abiding
womanliness
there
was
strength
as
well
as
beauty
tenderness
courage
charm
mate
for
a
man
said
dexter
aloud
for
such
women
as
evelina
the
knights
of
old
did
battle
and
men
of
other
centuries
fought
with
their
own
temptations
and
weaknesses
it
was
such
as
she
who
led
men
to
the
heights
and
pointed
them
to
heights
yet
farther
on
insensibly
he
compared
ralph
mother
with
evelina
the
two
women
stood
as
far
apart
as
a
little
meaningless
song
stands
from
a
great
symphony
one
would
fire
a
man
with
high
ambition
exalt
him
with
noble
striving
ah
but
had
she
was
it
evelina
fault
that
anthony
dexter
was
a
coward
and
a
shirk
cravenly
he
began
to
blame
the
woman
to
lay
the
burden
of
his
own
shortcomings
at
evelina
door
yet
still
the
face
stirred
him
there
was
life
in
those
walled
fastnesses
of
his
nature
which
long
ago
he
had
denied
at
last
confronted
him
and
would
not
be
put
away
and
so
evelina
he
said
aloud
you
have
come
back
and
what
do
you
want
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
bell
rang
sharply
as
if
answering
his
question
he
started
from
his
chair
having
heard
no
approaching
footsteps
he
covered
the
photograph
of
evelina
with
ralph
letters
but
the
sweet
face
of
the
boy
mother
still
looked
out
at
him
from
its
gilt
frame
the
old
housekeeper
went
to
the
door
with
the
utmost
leisure
it
seemed
to
him
an
eternity
before
the
door
was
opened
he
stood
there
waiting
summoning
his
faculties
of
calmness
and
his
powers
of
control
to
meet
evelina
to
have
out
at
last
all
the
shame
of
the
years
but
it
was
not
evelina
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
was
wiping
his
feet
carefully
upon
the
and
asking
in
deep
vibrant
tones
is
the
doctor
in
anthony
dexter
could
have
cried
out
from
relief
when
the
old
man
came
in
floundering
helplessly
among
the
furniture
as
a
person
does
he
greeted
him
with
a
cordiality
that
warmed
his
heart
i
am
glad
said
the
minister
to
find
you
in
sometimes
i
am
not
so
fortunate
i
came
late
for
that
reason
i
been
busy
returned
the
doctor
sit
down
the
minister
sank
into
an
easy
chair
and
leaned
toward
the
light
i
wish
i
could
have
a
lamp
like
this
in
my
room
he
remarked
it
gives
a
good
light
you
can
have
this
one
returned
dexter
with
an
hysterical
laugh
i
was
not
begging
said
thorpe
with
dignity
miss
lamps
are
all
small
some
of
them
give
no
more
light
than
a
candle
far
that
little
candle
throws
its
beams
quoted
dexter
shines
a
good
deed
in
a
naughty
world
there
was
a
long
interval
of
silence
sometimes
thorpe
and
doctor
dexter
would
sit
for
an
entire
evening
with
less
than
a
dozen
words
spoken
on
either
side
yet
feeling
the
comfort
of
human
companionship
i
was
thinking
said
thorpe
finally
of
the
supreme
isolation
of
the
human
soul
you
and
i
sit
here
talking
or
not
as
the
mood
strikes
us
and
yet
what
does
speech
matter
you
know
no
more
of
me
than
i
choose
to
give
you
nor
i
of
you
no
responded
dexter
that
is
quite
true
he
did
not
realise
what
thorpe
had
just
said
but
he
felt
that
it
was
safe
to
agree
one
grows
morbid
in
thinking
of
it
pursued
thorpe
screening
his
blue
eyes
from
the
light
with
his
hand
we
are
like
a
vast
plain
of
mountain
peaks
some
of
us
have
our
heads
in
the
clouds
always
up
among
the
eternal
snows
thunders
boom
about
us
lightning
rives
us
storm
and
sleet
beat
upon
us
there
is
a
rumbling
on
some
distant
peak
and
we
know
that
it
rains
there
too
that
is
all
we
ever
know
we
are
not
quite
sure
when
our
neighbours
are
happy
or
when
they
are
troubled
when
there
is
sun
and
when
there
is
storm
the
secret
forces
in
the
interior
of
the
mountain
work
on
unceasingly
the
distance
hides
it
all
we
never
get
near
enough
to
another
peak
to
see
the
scars
upon
its
surface
to
know
of
the
dead
timber
and
the
dried
streams
the
marks
of
avalanches
and
glacial
drift
the
precipices
and
pitfalls
the
barren
wastes
in
blue
shimmering
distance
the
peaks
are
veiled
and
all
seem
fair
but
our
own
at
the
word
veiled
dexter
shuddered
very
pretty
he
said
with
a
forced
laugh
which
sounded
flat
why
do
you
put
it
into
a
sermon
thorpe
face
became
troubled
my
sermons
do
not
please
he
answered
with
touching
simplicity
they
say
there
is
not
enough
of
hell
i
satisfied
commented
the
doctor
in
a
grating
voice
i
think
there
plenty
of
hell
you
never
come
to
church
remarked
the
minister
not
seeing
the
point
there
hell
enough
outside
for
any
reasonable
mortal
returned
dexter
he
was
keyed
to
a
high
pitch
he
felt
that
at
any
instant
something
might
snap
and
leave
him
inert
thorpe
sighed
his
wrinkled
old
hand
strayed
out
across
the
papers
and
turned
the
face
of
ralph
mother
toward
him
he
studied
it
closely
not
having
seen
it
before
then
he
looked
up
at
the
doctor
whose
face
was
again
like
a
mask
your
a
lift
of
the
eyebrows
finished
the
question
dexter
nodded
with
assumed
carelessness
there
was
another
long
pause
sometimes
i
envy
you
said
thorpe
laying
the
picture
down
carefully
you
have
had
so
much
of
life
and
joy
i
think
it
is
better
for
you
to
have
had
her
and
lost
her
than
not
to
have
had
her
at
all
he
continued
unconsciously
paraphrasing
even
in
your
loneliness
you
have
the
comfort
of
memory
and
your
boy
i
have
wondered
what
a
son
might
mean
to
me
now
in
my
old
age
dead
though
she
is
you
know
she
still
loves
you
that
somewhere
she
is
waiting
to
take
your
hand
in
hers
do
cried
dexter
the
strain
was
insupportable
forgive
me
my
friend
returned
thorpe
quickly
i
then
he
paused
as
i
was
saying
he
went
on
after
a
little
i
have
often
envied
you
do
said
dexter
again
as
you
were
also
saying
distance
hides
the
peak
and
you
do
not
see
the
scars
thorpe
eyes
sought
the
picture
of
dexter
wife
with
an
evident
tenderness
mingled
with
yearning
i
often
think
he
sighed
that
in
heaven
we
may
have
a
chance
to
pay
our
debt
to
woman
through
woman
agony
we
come
into
the
world
by
woman
care
we
are
nourished
by
woman
wisdom
we
are
taught
by
woman
love
we
are
sheltered
and
at
the
last
it
is
a
woman
who
closes
our
eyes
at
every
crisis
of
a
man
life
a
woman
is
always
waiting
to
help
him
if
she
may
and
i
have
seen
that
at
any
crisis
in
a
woman
life
we
are
apt
to
draw
back
and
shirk
she
helps
us
bear
our
difficulties
she
faces
hers
alone
dexter
turned
uneasily
in
his
chair
his
face
was
inscrutable
the
silent
moment
cried
out
for
speech
for
anything
to
relieve
the
tension
through
ralph
letters
evelina
eyes
seemed
to
be
upon
him
beseeching
him
to
speak
i
knew
a
man
said
anthony
dexter
hoarsely
who
unintentionally
contracted
quite
an
unusual
debt
to
a
woman
yes
returned
thorpe
inquiringly
he
was
interested
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
the
doctor
continued
with
difficulty
or
rather
a
classmate
i
knew
him
best
at
college
and
afterward
only
slightly
the
debt
thorpe
reminded
him
after
a
pause
you
were
speaking
of
his
debt
to
a
woman
dexter
turned
his
face
away
from
thorpe
and
from
the
accusing
eyes
beneath
ralph
letters
she
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
he
went
on
carefully
choosing
his
words
and
they
loved
each
other
as
people
love
but
once
my
my
friend
was
much
absorbed
in
chemistry
and
had
a
fondness
for
original
experiment
she
the
girl
you
know
used
to
study
with
him
he
was
teaching
her
and
she
often
helped
him
in
the
laboratory
they
were
to
be
married
continued
dexter
the
day
before
they
were
to
be
married
he
went
to
her
house
and
invited
her
to
come
to
the
laboratory
to
see
an
experiment
which
he
was
trying
for
the
first
time
and
which
promised
to
be
unusually
interesting
i
need
not
explain
the
experiment
you
would
not
understand
on
the
way
to
the
laboratory
they
were
talking
as
lovers
will
she
asked
him
if
he
loved
her
because
she
was
herself
because
of
all
the
women
in
the
world
she
was
the
one
god
meant
for
him
or
if
he
loved
her
because
he
thought
her
beautiful
he
said
that
he
loved
her
because
she
was
herself
and
most
of
all
because
she
was
his
she
asked
timidly
i
am
old
and
all
the
beauty
has
gone
you
will
love
me
still
it
will
be
the
same
even
when
i
am
no
longer
lovely
he
answered
her
as
any
man
would
never
dreaming
how
soon
he
was
to
be
tested
in
the
laboratory
they
were
quite
alone
he
began
the
experiment
explaining
as
he
went
and
she
watched
it
as
eagerly
as
he
he
turned
away
for
a
moment
to
get
another
chemical
as
he
leaned
over
the
retort
to
put
it
in
he
heard
it
seethe
with
all
her
strength
she
pushed
him
away
instantly
there
was
an
explosion
which
shook
the
walls
of
the
laboratory
a
quantity
of
deadly
gas
was
released
and
in
the
fumes
they
both
fainted
when
he
came
to
his
senses
he
learned
that
she
had
been
terribly
burned
and
had
been
taken
on
the
train
to
the
hospital
he
was
the
one
physician
in
the
place
and
it
was
the
only
thing
to
be
done
as
soon
as
he
could
he
went
to
the
hospital
they
told
him
there
that
her
life
would
be
saved
and
they
hoped
for
her
eyesight
but
that
she
would
be
permanently
and
horribly
disfigured
all
of
her
features
were
destroyed
they
said
she
would
be
only
a
pitiful
wreck
of
a
woman
thorpe
was
silent
his
blue
eyes
were
dim
with
pity
dexter
rose
and
stood
in
front
of
him
do
you
understand
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
unrecognisable
his
face
was
close
to
the
retort
when
she
pushed
him
away
she
saved
his
life
and
he
went
away
he
never
saw
her
again
he
left
her
without
so
much
as
a
word
he
went
away
asked
the
minister
incredulously
went
away
and
left
her
when
she
had
so
much
to
bear
deserted
her
when
she
needed
him
to
help
her
bear
it
and
when
she
had
saved
him
from
death
or
worse
you
would
not
believe
it
possible
queried
dexter
endeavouring
to
make
his
voice
even
of
a
cur
yes
said
the
minister
his
voice
trembling
with
indignation
but
of
a
man
no
anthony
dexter
shrank
back
within
himself
he
was
breathing
heavily
but
his
companion
did
not
notice
it
was
long
ago
the
doctor
continued
when
he
had
partially
regained
his
composure
he
dared
not
tell
thorpe
that
the
man
had
married
in
the
meantime
lest
he
should
guess
too
much
the
woman
still
lives
and
my
friend
lives
also
he
has
never
felt
right
about
it
what
should
he
do
the
honour
of
the
spoken
word
still
holds
him
said
thorpe
evenly
as
i
understand
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
she
consented
he
was
never
released
from
his
promise
did
not
even
ask
for
it
he
slunk
away
like
a
cur
in
the
sight
of
god
he
is
bound
to
her
by
his
own
word
still
he
should
go
to
her
and
either
fulfil
his
promise
or
ask
for
release
the
tardy
fulfilment
of
his
promise
would
be
the
only
atonement
he
could
make
the
midnight
train
came
in
and
stopped
but
neither
heard
it
it
would
be
very
difficult
thorpe
was
saying
to
retain
any
shred
of
respect
for
a
man
like
that
it
shows
your
broad
charity
when
you
call
him
i
myself
have
not
so
much
grace
anthony
dexter
breath
came
painfully
he
tightened
his
fingers
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
said
nothing
it
is
a
peculiar
coincidence
mused
thorpe
he
was
thinking
aloud
now
in
the
old
house
just
beyond
miss
mehitable
farther
up
you
know
a
woman
has
just
come
to
live
who
seems
to
have
passed
through
something
like
that
it
would
be
strange
would
it
not
if
she
were
the
one
whom
your
friend
had
wronged
very
answered
dexter
in
a
voice
the
other
scarcely
heard
perhaps
in
this
way
we
may
bring
them
together
again
if
the
woman
is
here
and
you
can
find
your
friend
we
may
help
him
to
wash
the
stain
of
cowardice
off
his
soul
sometimes
cried
thorpe
passionately
i
think
there
is
no
sin
but
shirking
i
can
excuse
a
liar
i
can
pardon
a
thief
i
can
pity
a
murderer
but
a
shirk
no
his
voice
broke
and
his
wrinkled
old
hands
trembled
my
my
friend
lied
anthony
dexter
wiping
the
cold
sweat
from
his
forehead
lives
abroad
i
have
no
way
of
finding
him
it
is
a
pity
returned
thorpe
think
of
a
man
meeting
his
god
like
that
it
tempts
one
to
believe
in
a
veritable
hell
i
think
there
is
a
veritable
hell
said
dexter
with
a
laugh
which
was
not
good
to
hear
i
think
by
this
time
my
friend
must
believe
in
it
as
well
i
remember
that
he
did
not
before
the
it
i
mean
happened
far
from
feeling
relief
anthony
dexter
was
scourged
anew
a
thousand
demons
leaped
from
the
silence
to
mock
him
the
earth
rolled
beneath
his
feet
the
impulse
of
confession
was
strong
upon
him
even
in
the
face
of
thorpe
scorn
he
wondered
why
only
one
church
saw
the
need
of
the
confessional
why
he
could
not
go
even
to
thorpe
and
share
the
burden
that
oppressed
his
guilty
soul
the
silence
was
not
to
be
borne
the
walls
of
the
room
swayed
back
and
forth
as
though
they
were
of
fabric
and
stirred
by
all
the
winds
of
hell
the
floor
undulated
his
chair
sank
dizzily
beneath
him
dexter
struggled
to
his
feet
clutching
convulsively
at
the
table
his
lips
were
parched
and
his
tongue
clung
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
thorpe
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
i
the
minister
raised
his
hand
listen
i
thought
i
heard
a
whistle
sounded
outside
the
gate
clanged
shut
a
quick
light
step
ran
up
the
walk
the
door
opened
noisily
and
a
man
rushed
in
he
seemed
to
bring
into
that
hopeless
place
all
the
freshness
of
immortal
youth
blinded
dexter
moved
forward
his
hands
outstretched
to
meet
that
eager
clasp
father
father

ralph
joyously

viii
piper
tom
laddie
said
the
piper
to
the
yellow
mongrel
we
be
having
breakfast
now
the
dog
answered
with
a
joyous
yelp
you
talk
too
much
observed
his
master
in
affectionate
reproof
is
fitting
that
small
yellow
dogs
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
it
was
scarcely
sunrise
but
the
piper
day
began
and
ended
early
he
had
a
roaring
fire
in
the
tiny
stove
which
warmed
his
shop
and
the
hummed
cheerily
all
about
him
was
the
atmosphere
of
immaculate
neatness
it
was
not
merely
the
lack
of
dust
and
dirt
but
a
positive
cleanliness
his
beardless
face
was
youthful
but
the
piper
hair
was
tinged
with
grey
at
the
temples
one
judged
him
to
be
well
past
forty
yet
fully
to
have
retained
his
youth
his
round
rosy
mouth
was
puckered
in
a
whistle
as
he
moved
about
the
shop
and
spread
the
tiny
table
with
a
clean
cloth
ranged
about
him
in
orderly
rows
was
his
merchandise
tom
barnaby
never
bothered
with
fixtures
and
showcases
chairs
drygoods
boxes
rough
shelves
of
his
own
making
and
a
few
baskets
sufficed
him
in
the
waterproof
pedler
pack
which
he
carried
on
his
back
when
his
shop
was
in
transit
he
had
only
the
smaller
articles
which
women
continually
need
calico
mosquito
netting
buttons
needles
thread
tape
ribbons
stationery
hooks
and
eyes
elastic
shoe
laces
sewing
silk
darning
cotton
pins
skirt
binding
and
a
few
small
frivolities
in
the
way
of
neckwear
veils
and
belts
these
formed
piper
stock
in
trade
by
dint
of
close
packing
he
wedged
an
astonishing
number
of
things
into
a
small
space
and
was
not
too
heavily
laden
when
with
his
dog
and
his
flute
he
set
forth
upon
the
highway
to
establish
his
shop
in
the
next
place
that
seemed
promising
all
unknowing
laddie
he
said
to
the
dog
as
he
sat
down
to
his
simple
breakfast
we
come
into
competition
with
a
woman
who
keeps
a
shop
like
ours
which
we
did
mean
to
do
it
for
this
that
we
were
making
a
new
set
of
price
tags
all
day
of
yesterday
which
happened
to
be
the
sabbath
it
would
be
becoming
of
us
to
charge
less
than
she
and
take
her
trade
away
from
her
so
we
started
out
on
an
even
basis
poor
lady
laughed
the
piper
she
was
not
willing
for
us
to
know
her
prices
thinking
we
were
going
to
sell
cheaper
than
she
is
a
hard
world
for
women
laddie
i
thinking
is
no
wonder
they
grow
suspicious
at
times
the
dog
sat
patiently
till
piper
tom
finished
his
breakfast
well
knowing
that
a
generous
share
would
be
given
him
outside
while
the
dog
ate
his
master
put
the
shop
into
the
most
perfect
order
removing
every
particle
of
dust
and
whistling
meanwhile
when
the
weather
permitted
the
shop
was
often
left
to
keep
itself
the
door
being
hospitably
propped
open
with
a
brick
while
the
dog
and
his
master
went
gypsying
with
a
ragged
book
in
one
pocket
a
parcel
of
bread
and
cheese
in
another
and
his
flute
slung
over
his
shoulder
the
piper
was
prepared
to
spend
the
day
abroad
he
carried
too
a
bone
for
the
dog
well
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
an
old
silver
cup
to
drink
from
having
finished
his
breakfast
the
dog
scampered
about
eagerly
indicating
by
many
leaps
and
barks
that
it
was
time
to
travel
but
the
piper
raised
his
hand
not
laddie
he
said
if
we
travel
we
not
be
going
far
have
you
forgotten
that
was
only
day
before
yesterday
we
found
our
work
come
here
the
dog
seated
himself
before
the
piper
his
stubby
tail
wagging
impatiently
she
a
poor
soul
laddie
sighed
the
piper
at
length
thinking
she
seen
sorrow
face
to
face
and
has
never
had
the
courage
to
turn
away
she
was
walking
in
the
woods
trying
to
find
the
strange
music
and
was
disappointed
when
she
saw
was
only
us
we
must
make
her
glad
was
us
after
a
long
time
the
piper
spoke
again
with
a
lingering
tenderness
she
must
be
very
beautiful
i
thinking
laddie
else
she
would
not
hide
her
face
very
beautiful
and
very
sad
when
the
sun
was
high
piper
tom
climbed
the
hill
followed
by
his
faithful
dog
on
his
shoulder
he
bore
a
scythe
and
under
the
other
arm
was
a
spade
he
entered
miss
evelina
gate
without
ceremony
and
made
a
wry
face
as
he
looked
about
him
he
scarcely
knew
where
to
begin
the
sound
of
the
wide
even
strokes
roused
miss
evelina
from
her
lethargy
and
she
went
to
the
window
veiled
at
first
she
was
frightened
when
she
saw
the
queer
man
whom
she
had
met
in
the
woods
hard
at
work
in
her
garden
the
red
feather
in
his
hat
bobbed
cheerfully
up
and
down
the
little
yellow
dog
ran
about
busily
and
the
piper
was
whistling
lustily
an
old
tune
she
watched
him
for
some
time
then
a
new
thought
frightened
her
again
she
had
no
money
with
which
to
pay
him
for
clearing
out
her
garden
and
he
would
undoubtedly
expect
payment
she
must
go
out
and
tell
him
not
to
work
any
more
that
she
did
not
wish
to
have
the
weeds
removed
cringing
before
the
necessity
she
went
out
the
piper
did
not
see
her
until
she
was
very
near
him
then
startled
in
his
turn
he
said
oh
and
took
off
his
hat
madam
he
went
on
making
a
low
bow
she
noted
that
the
tip
of
his
red
feather
brushed
the
ground
what
can
i
do
for
you
more
than
i
doing
now
it
is
about
that
stammered
evelina
that
i
came
you
must
not
work
in
my
garden
surely
said
the
piper
you
do
mean
that
would
you
have
it
all
weeds
and
is
hard
work
for
such
as
you
i
i
answered
miss
evelina
almost
in
a
whisper
i
have
no
money
the
piper
laughed
heartily
and
put
on
his
hat
again
neither
have
i
he
said
between
bursts
of
seemingly
merriment
and
probably
i
the
only
man
in
these
parts
who
not
looking
for
it
did
you
think
i
ask
for
pay
for
working
in
the
garden
his
tone
made
her
feel
that
she
had
misjudged
him
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
reply
laddie
and
i
have
no
garden
of
our
own
he
explained
and
so
digging
in
yours
the
place
wants
cleaning
for
is
a
long
time
since
any
one
cared
enough
for
it
to
dig
i
was
passing
and
i
saw
a
place
i
thought
i
could
make
more
pleasant
have
i
your
leave
to
try
why
why
yes
returned
miss
evelina
slowly
if
you
like
to
i
do
mind
he
dismissed
her
airily
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
she
went
back
into
the
house
never
once
turning
her
head
she
our
work
laddie
said
the
piper
and
i
thinking
we
begun
in
the
right
way
all
the
old
sadness
is
piled
up
in
the
garden
and
i
thinking
there
weeds
in
her
life
too
that
it
our
business
to
take
out
at
any
rate
we
begin
here
and
do
this
first
one
step
at
a
time
laddie
one
step
at
a
time
that
all
we
have
to
take
fortunately
when
we
ca
see
ahead
it
because
we
ca
look
around
a
corner
all
that
day
from
behind
her
cobwebbed
windows
miss
evelina
watched
the
piper
and
his
dog
weeds
and
thistles
fell
like
magic
before
his
strong
sure
strokes
he
carried
out
armful
after
armful
of
rubbish
and
made
a
mountain
in
the
road
confining
it
with
stray
boards
and
broken
branches
as
it
was
too
wet
to
be
burned
wherever
she
went
in
the
empty
house
she
heard
that
cheery
persistent
whistle
as
usual
miss
hitty
left
a
tray
on
her
doorstep
laden
with
warm
wholesome
food
since
that
first
day
she
had
made
no
attempt
to
see
miss
evelina
she
brought
her
tray
rapped
and
went
away
quietly
exchanging
it
for
another
when
it
was
time
for
the
next
meal
meanwhile
miss
evelina
starved
body
was
responding
slowly
but
surely
to
the
simple
food
hitherto
she
had
not
cared
to
eat
and
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
eating
now
she
had
learned
to
discriminate
between
hot
rolls
and
biscuit
between
thick
soups
and
thin
broths
custards
and
jellies
miss
evelina
had
wound
one
of
the
clocks
setting
it
by
the
midnight
train
and
loosening
the
machinery
by
a
few
drops
of
oil
which
she
had
found
in
an
old
bottle
securely
corked
at
eight
at
one
and
at
six
miss
hitty
tray
was
left
at
her
back
door
there
had
not
been
the
variation
of
a
minute
since
the
first
day
preoccupied
though
she
was
evelina
was
not
insensible
of
the
kindness
nor
of
the
fact
that
she
was
stronger
physically
than
she
had
been
for
years
and
now
in
the
desolate
garden
there
was
visible
evidence
of
more
kindness
perhaps
the
world
was
not
wholly
a
place
of
grief
and
tears
out
there
among
the
weeds
a
man
laboured
cheerfully
a
man
of
whom
she
had
no
knowledge
and
upon
whom
she
had
no
claim
he
sang
and
whistled
as
he
strove
mightily
with
the
weeds
now
and
then
he
sharpened
his
scythe
with
his
whetstone
and
attacked
the
dense
undergrowth
with
yet
more
vigour
the
little
yellow
mongrel
capered
joyfully
and
unceasingly
affecting
to
hide
amidst
the
mass
of
rubbish
scrambling
out
with
sharp
eager
barks
when
his
master
playfully
buried
him
and
retreating
hastily
before
the
oncoming
scythe
miss
evelina
could
not
hear
but
she
knew
that
the
man
was
talking
to
the
dog
in
the
pauses
of
his
whistling
she
knew
also
that
the
dog
liked
it
even
if
he
did
not
understand
she
observed
that
the
dog
was
not
beautiful
could
not
be
called
so
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
and
yet
the
man
talked
to
him
made
a
friend
of
him
loved
him
at
noon
the
piper
laid
down
his
scythe
clambered
up
on
the
crumbling
stone
wall
and
ate
his
bread
and
cheese
while
the
dog
nibbled
at
his
bone
from
behind
a
shutter
in
an
upper
room
miss
evelina
noted
that
the
dog
also
had
bread
and
cheese
sharing
equally
with
his
master
the
piper
went
to
the
well
near
the
kitchen
door
and
drank
copiously
of
the
cool
clear
water
from
his
silver
cup
then
he
went
back
to
work
again
out
in
the
road
the
rubbish
accumulated
when
the
piper
stood
behind
it
miss
evelina
could
barely
see
the
tip
of
the
red
feather
that
bobbed
rakishly
in
his
hat
once
he
disappeared
leaving
the
dog
to
keep
a
reluctant
guard
over
the
spade
and
scythe
when
he
came
back
he
had
a
rake
and
a
large
basket
which
made
the
collection
of
rubbish
easier
safe
in
her
house
miss
evelina
watched
him
idly
her
thought
was
taken
from
herself
for
the
first
time
in
all
the
years
she
contemplated
anew
the
willing
service
of
miss
mehitable
who
asked
nothing
of
her
except
the
privilege
of
leaving
daily
sustenance
at
her
barred
and
forbidding
door
truly
said
miss
evelina
to
herself
it
is
a
strange
world
the
personality
of
the
piper
affected
her
in
a
way
she
could
not
analyse
he
did
not
attract
her
neither
was
he
wholly
repellent
she
did
not
feel
friendly
toward
him
yet
she
could
not
turn
wholly
aside
there
had
been
something
strangely
alluring
in
his
music
which
haunted
her
even
now
though
she
resented
his
making
game
of
her
and
leading
her
through
the
woods
as
he
had
over
and
above
and
beyond
all
she
remembered
the
encounter
upon
the
road
always
with
a
keen
remorseless
pain
which
cut
at
her
heart
like
a
knife
miss
evelina
thought
she
was
familiar
with
knives
but
this
one
hurt
in
a
new
way
and
cut
seemingly
at
a
place
which
had
not
been
touched
before
since
the
white
night
which
had
turned
her
hair
to
lustreless
snow
nothing
had
hurt
her
so
much
her
coming
to
the
empty
house
driven
as
she
was
by
poverty
entering
alone
into
a
tomb
of
memories
and
dead
happiness
had
not
stabbed
so
deeply
or
so
surely
she
saw
herself
first
on
one
peak
and
then
on
another
a
valley
of
humiliation
and
suffering
between
which
it
had
taken
years
to
cross
from
the
greatest
hurt
at
the
beginning
to
the
greatest
hurt
at
the
end
miss
evelina
started
from
her
chair
her
hands
upon
her
leaping
heart
the
end
ah
dear
god
no
there
was
no
end
to
grief
like
hers
insistently
through
her
memory
sounded
the
pipes
o
pan
the
wild
sweet
tremulous
strain
which
had
led
her
away
from
the
road
where
she
had
been
splashed
with
the
mud
from
anthony
dexter
carriage
wheels
the
man
with
the
red
feather
in
his
hat
had
called
her
and
she
had
come
now
he
was
digging
in
her
garden
making
the
desolate
place
clean
if
not
cheerful
conscious
of
an
unfamiliar
detachment
miss
evelina
settled
herself
to
think
the
first
hurt
and
the
long
pain
which
followed
it
the
blurred
agony
of
remembrance
when
she
had
come
back
to
the
empty
house
then
the
sharp
stroke
when
she
stood
on
the
road
her
eyes
downcast
and
heard
the
wheels
rush
by
then
clear
and
challenging
the
pipes
o
pan
is
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
she
thought
them
how
we
may
where
had
she
heard
that
before
she
remembered
now
it
was
a
favourite
quotation
of
anthony
dexter
her
lip
curled
scornfully
was
she
never
to
be
free
from
anthony
dexter
was
she
always
to
be
confronted
with
his
cowardice
his
shirking
his
spoken
and
written
thoughts
was
she
always
to
see
his
face
as
she
had
seen
it
last
his
great
love
for
her
shining
in
his
eyes
for
all
the
world
to
read
was
she
to
see
forever
his
pearl
necklace
discoloured
snaky
and
cold
as
meaningless
as
the
yellow
slip
of
paper
that
had
come
with
it
where
was
the
divinity
that
had
shaped
her
course
hither
why
had
she
been
driven
back
to
the
place
of
her
crucifixion
to
stand
veiled
in
the
road
while
he
drove
by
and
splashed
her
with
mud
from
his
wheels
out
in
the
garden
the
piper
still
strove
with
the
weeds
he
had
the
place
nearly
half
cleared
now
the
space
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
was
as
yet
untouched
and
the
trees
and
shrubbery
all
needed
trimming
the
wall
was
broken
in
places
earth
had
drifted
upon
it
and
grass
and
weeds
had
taken
root
in
the
crevices
upon
one
side
of
the
house
nearly
all
of
the
bare
earth
had
been
raked
clean
he
was
on
the
western
slope
now
where
the
splendid
poppies
had
once
grown
pausing
in
his
whistling
the
piper
stooped
and
picked
up
some
small
object
miss
evelina
cowered
behind
her
shielding
shutters
for
she
guessed
that
he
had
found
the
empty
vial
which
had
contained
laudanum
the
piper
sniffed
twice
at
the
bottle
his
scent
was
as
keen
as
a
hunting
dog
then
he
glanced
quickly
toward
the
house
where
miss
evelina
unveiled
shrank
back
into
the
farthest
corner
of
an
upper
room
he
walked
to
the
gate
no
longer
whistling
and
slowly
thoughtfully
buried
it
deep
in
the
rubbish
could
miss
evelina
have
seen
his
face
she
would
have
marvelled
at
the
tenderness
which
transfigured
it
and
wondered
at
the
mist
that
veiled
his
eyes
he
stood
at
the
gate
for
a
long
time
leaning
on
his
scythe
his
back
to
the
house
in
sympathy
with
his
master
mood
the
dog
was
quiet
and
merely
nosed
about
among
the
rubbish
by
a
flash
of
intuition
miss
evelina
knew
that
the
finding
of
the
bottle
had
made
clear
to
the
piper
much
that
he
had
not
known
before
she
felt
herself
an
open
book
before
those
kind
keen
eyes
which
neither
sought
nor
avoided
her
veiled
face
all
the
sorrow
and
the
secret
suffering
would
be
his
if
he
chose
to
read
it
miss
evelina
knew
that
she
must
keep
away
the
sun
set
without
splendour
still
the
piper
stood
there
leaning
on
his
scythe
thinking
all
the
rubbish
in
the
garden
was
old
except
the
empty
laudanum
bottle
the
label
was
still
legible
and
also
the
warning
word
poison
she
had
put
it
there
herself
he
had
no
doubt
of
that
the
dog
whined
and
licked
his
master
hand
as
though
to
say
it
was
time
to
go
home
at
length
the
piper
roused
himself
and
gathered
up
his
tools
he
carried
them
to
a
shed
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
miss
evelina
watching
knew
that
he
was
coming
back
to
finish
his
task
yes
said
the
piper
we
be
going
is
not
needful
to
bark
he
went
slowly
the
little
dog
trotting
beside
him
and
occasionally
licking
his
hand
they
went
into
the
shop
the
door
of
which
was
still
propped
open
the
piper
built
a
fire
removed
his
coat
and
hat
took
off
his
leggings
cleaned
his
boots
and
washed
his
hands
then
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
it
was
he
sat
down
the
dog
sat
down
too
pressing
hard
against
him
the
piper
took
the
head
between
his
hands
and
looked
long
into
the
loving
eager
eyes
she
will
be
very
beautiful
laddie
he
sighed
at
length
very
beautiful
and
very
brave
ix
housecleaning
the
brisk
steady
tap
sounded
at
miss
evelina
door
it
was
a
little
after
eight
and
she
opened
it
expecting
to
find
her
breakfast
as
usual
much
to
her
surprise
miss
mehitable
stood
there
armed
with
a
pail
mop
and
broom
behind
her
shy
and
frightened
was
araminta
similarly
equipped
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
having
carried
a
to
the
back
door
had
then
been
abruptly
dismissed
under
the
handle
of
her
scrubbing
pail
the
ministering
angel
had
slipped
the
tray
containing
miss
evelina
breakfast
i
slopped
it
over
some
she
said
in
explanation
but
you
mind
that
someway
i
never
had
hands
enough
to
do
what
i
had
to
do
most
of
the
work
in
the
world
is
slid
onto
women
and
then
as
if
that
was
enough
they
given
skirts
to
hold
up
too
seems
to
me
that
if
the
almighty
had
meant
for
women
to
be
carrying
skirts
all
their
lives
he
have
give
us
another
hand
and
elbow
in
our
backs
like
a
jinted
for
the
purpose
not
having
the
extra
hand
i
go
short
on
skirts
when
i
cleaning
miss
mehitable
clean
crisp
calico
gown
ceased
abruptly
at
her
ankles
araminta
blue
and
white
gingham
was
of
a
similar
length
and
her
sleeves
guiltless
of
ruffles
came
only
to
her
dimpled
elbows
araminta
was
trying
hard
not
to
stare
at
miss
evelina
veil
while
aunt
hitty
talked
we
come
asserted
miss
mehitable
to
clean
your
house
cleaned
our
own
and
we
ai
tired
yet
so
we
going
to
do
some
scrubbing
here
i
guess
it
needs
it
miss
evelina
was
reminded
of
the
piper
who
was
digging
in
her
garden
because
he
had
no
garden
of
his
own
i
ca
let
you
she
said
hesitating
over
the
words
you
too
kind
to
me
and
i
going
to
do
my
cleaning
myself
fiddlesticks
snorted
miss
hitty
brushing
miss
evelina
from
her
path
and
marching
triumphantly
in
you
ai
strong
enough
to
do
cleaning
you
just
set
down
and
eat
your
breakfast
me
and
minty
will
begin
upstairs
in
obedience
to
a
gesture
from
her
aunt
araminta
crept
upstairs
the
house
had
not
yet
taken
on
a
habitable
look
and
as
she
stood
in
the
large
front
room
deep
in
dust
and
draped
with
cobwebs
she
was
afraid
meanwhile
miss
mehitable
had
built
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
stove
put
kettles
of
water
on
to
heat
stretched
a
line
across
the
yard
and
brought
in
the
miss
evelina
sat
quietly
and
apparently
took
no
notice
of
the
stir
that
was
going
on
about
her
she
had
not
touched
her
breakfast
why
do
you
eat
inquired
miss
hitty
not
unkindly
i
not
hungry
returned
miss
evelina
timidly
well
answered
miss
mehitable
her
perception
having
acted
in
the
interval
i
do
wonder
you
ai
with
all
this
racket
goin
on
i
be
out
of
here
in
a
minute
and
then
you
can
set
here
nice
and
quiet
and
eat
i
never
like
to
eat
when
there
anything
else
going
on
around
me
it
drives
me
crazy
true
to
her
word
she
soon
ascended
the
stairs
where
the
quaking
araminta
awaited
her
it
take
some
time
for
the
water
to
heat
observed
miss
hitty
but
there
plenty
to
do
before
we
get
to
scrubbing
remember
what
i
told
you
minty
the
first
step
in
cleaning
a
room
is
to
take
out
of
it
everything
that
ai
nailed
to
it
every
window
was
opened
to
its
highest
point
some
were
difficult
to
move
but
with
the
aid
of
araminta
strong
young
arms
they
eventually
went
up
as
desired
from
the
windows
descended
torrents
of
bedding
rugs
and
curtains
a
veritable
dust
storm
being
raised
in
the
process
when
i
go
down
after
the
hot
water
i
hang
these
things
on
the
line
said
miss
mehitable
briskly
they
ca
get
any
dustier
on
the
ground
than
they
are
now
the
curtains
were
so
frail
that
they
fell
apart
in
miss
hitty
hands
you
can
make
her
some
new
ones
minty
she
said
she
can
get
some
muslin
at
mis
allen
and
you
can
sew
on
curtains
for
a
while
instead
of
quilts
it
be
a
change
none
too
carefully
miss
mehitable
tore
up
the
rag
carpet
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
sneezing
violently
there
considerable
less
dirt
here
already
than
there
was
when
we
come
she
continued
though
we
ai
done
any
real
cleaning
yet
she
ca
never
put
that
carpet
down
again
it
too
weak
we
get
a
bucket
of
paint
and
paint
the
floors
i
guess
sarah
grey
had
plenty
of
rugs
she
got
a
lot
of
rag
carpeting
put
away
in
the
attic
if
the
moths
ai
ate
it
and
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
believe
she
packed
it
into
the
cedar
chest
anyway
i
advised
her
to
come
handy
i
told
her
evelina
if
you
do
live
to
use
it
yourself
so
if
the
moths
ai
got
the
good
of
it
there
carpet
that
can
be
made
into
rugs
with
some
fringe
on
the
ends
i
always
did
like
the
smell
of
fresh
paint
anyhow
there
nothin
you
can
put
into
a
house
that
make
it
smell
as
fresh
and
clean
as
paint
varnish
is
good
too
but
it
more
expensive
i
go
down
now
and
get
the
hot
water
and
the
ladder
i
reckon
through
with
her
breakfast
by
this
time
miss
evelina
had
finished
her
breakfast
as
the
empty
tray
proved
she
sat
listlessly
in
her
chair
and
the
water
on
the
stove
was
boiling
over
my
sakes
evelina
cried
miss
hitty
sharply
i
should
think
you
i
should
think
you
hear
the
water
fallin
on
the
stove
she
concluded
lamely
it
was
impossible
to
scold
her
as
she
would
have
scolded
araminta
i
goin
out
now
to
put
things
on
the
line
continued
miss
hitty
when
i
get
minty
started
to
cleanin
i
come
down
and
beat
miss
evelina
made
no
response
she
watched
her
brisk
neighbour
wearily
without
interest
as
she
hurried
about
the
yard
dragging
mattresses
into
the
sunlight
hanging
musty
bedding
on
the
line
and
carrying
the
worn
curtains
to
the
mountain
of
rubbish
which
the
piper
had
reared
in
front
of
the
house
that
creeter
with
the
red
feather
can
clean
the
yard
if
he
a
mind
to
mused
miss
hitty
who
was
fully
conversant
with
the
piper
work
but
he
ca
clean
the
house
i
going
to
do
that
myself
she
went
in
and
was
presently
in
her
element
the
smell
of
yellow
soap
was
as
sweet
incense
in
the
nostrils
of
miss
hitty
and
the
sound
of
the
scrubbing
brush
was
melodious
in
her
ears
she
brushed
down
the
walls
with
a
flannel
cloth
tied
over
a
broom
washed
the
windows
scrubbed
every
inch
of
the
woodwork
and
prepared
the
floor
for
its
destined
coat
of
paint
then
she
sent
araminta
into
the
next
room
with
the
ladder
and
began
on
the
furniture
this
too
was
thoroughly
scrubbed
and
as
much
paint
and
varnish
as
would
come
off
was
allowed
to
come
it
have
to
be
painted
thought
miss
hitty
scrubbing
happily
but
when
it
is
painted
it
be
clean
underneath
and
that
more
than
it

first
time

a
year

in
this
house
and
before

i
lend
her
some
of
my
clean
sheets
and
a
quilt
or
two
of
minty
adjourning
to
the
back
yard
miss
mehitable
energetically
beat
a
mattress
until
no
more
dust
rose
from
it
with
araminta
aid
she
carried
it
upstairs
and
put
it
in
place
i
goin
home

after
my
dinner
and

miss
hitty
and

sheets
and
quilts
for
this
you
clean
till
i
come
back
and
then
you
can
go
home
for
your
own
lunch
araminta
assented
and
continued
her
work
she
never
questioned
her
aunt
dictates
and
this
was
why
there
was
no
friction
between
the
two
when
miss
mehitable
came
back
however
half
buried
under
the
mountain
of
bedding
she
was
greeted
by
a
portentous
silence
hurrying
upstairs
she
discovered
that
araminta
had
fallen
from
the
ladder
and
was
in
a
white
and
helpless
heap
on
the
floor
while
miss
evelina
chafed
her
hands
and
sprinkled
her
face
with
water
for
the
land
sake
cried
miss
hitty
what
possessed
minty
to
go
and
fall
off
the
ladder
help
me
pick
her
up
evelina
and
we
lay
her
on
the
bed
in
the
room
we
just
cleaned
she
come
to
presently
she
ai
hurt
but
araminta
did
not
come
to
miss
mehitable
tried
everything
she
could
think
of
and
fairly
drenched
the
girl
with
cold
water
without
avail
what
did
it
she
demanded
with
some
asperity
did
she
see
anything
that
scared
her
no
answered
miss
evelina
shrinking
farther
back
into
her
veil
i
was
downstairs
and
heard
her
scream
then
she
fell
and
i
ran
up
it
was
just
a
minute
or
two
before
you
came
in
well
sighed
miss
hitty
i
suppose
we
have
to
have
a
doctor
you
fix
that
bed
with
the
clean
things
i
brought
it
easy
to
do
it
without
movin
her
after
the
under
sheet
is
on
and
i
help
you
with
that
do
pour
any
more
cold
water
on
her
if
water
would
have
brung
her
to
she
be
settin
up
by
now
and
do
get
scared
minty
ai
hurt
with
this
comforting
assurance
miss
hitty
sped
but
her
mind
was
far
from
at
rest
at
the
gate
she
stopped
suddenly
confronted
by
the
fact
that
she
could
not
bring
anthony
dexter
to
evelina
house
what
i
do
moaned
miss
hitty
what
i
do
minty
die
if
she
ai
dead
now
the
tears
rolled
down
her
wrinkled
cheeks
but
she
ran
on
as
fast
as
her
feet
would
carry
her
toward
doctor
dexter
the
way
be
opened
she
thought
i
sure
it
will
the
way
was
opened
in
an
unexpected
fashion
for
doctor
ralph
dexter
answered
miss
hitty
frantic
ring
at
his
door
i
clean
forgotten
you
she
stammered
wholly
taken
aback
i
believe
you
anything
but
a
play
doctor
but
as
things
is
i
reckon
you
have
to
do
doctor
ralph
dexter
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
a
clear
ringing
boyish
laugh
which
was
very
good
to
hear
doctor
is
good
he
said
when
anybody
worked
as
much
like
a
yellow
dog
as
i
have
anyhow
i
have
to
do
for
father
not
at
home
who
dead
it
araminta
explained
miss
hitty
already
greatly
relieved
she
fell
off
a
and
ai
come
to
yet
doctor
ralph
face
grew
grave
wait
a
minute
he
went
into
the
office
and
returned
almost
immediately
as
luck
would
have
it
the
doctor
carriage
was
at
the
door
waiting
for
a
hurry
call
jump
in
commanded
doctor
ralph
you
can
tell
me
about
it
on
the
way
where
do
we
go
miss
hitty
issued
directions
to
the
driver
and
climbed
in
in
spite
of
her
trouble
she
was
not
insensible
of
the
comfort
of
the
cushions
nor
the
comparative
luxury
of
the
conveyance
she
was
also
mindful
of
the
excitement
her
presence
in
the
doctor
carriage
produced
in
her
acquaintances
as
they
rushed
past
by
dint
of
much
questioning
doctor
ralph
obtained
a
full
account
of
the
accident
all
immaterial
circumstances
being
brutally
eliminated
as
they
cropped
up
in
the
course
of
her
speech
it
god
own
mercy
said
miss
hitty
as
they
stopped
at
the
gate
that
we
cleaned
that
room
we
could
have
got
it
any
cleaner
if
was
for
a
layin
out
instead
of
a
sickness
oh
ralph
she
pleaded
do
let
minty
die
hush
said
doctor
ralph
sternly
he
spoke
with
an
authority
new
to
miss
hitty
who
in
earlier
days
had
been
wont
to
drive
ralph
out
of
her
incipient
orchard
with
a
bed
slat
sharpened
at
one
end
into
a
formidable
weapon
of
offence
araminta
was
still
unconscious
but
she
was
undressed
and
in
bed
clad
in
one
of
miss
evelina
dainty
but
yellowed
nightgowns
doctor
ralph
worked
with
incredible
quickness
and
miss
hitty
watched
him
wondering
frightened
yet
with
a
certain
sneaking
confidence
in
him
fracture
of
the
ankle
he
announced
briefly
and
one
or
two
bad
bruises
plaster
cast
and
no
moving
when
araminta
returned
to
consciousness
she
thought
she
was
dead
and
had
gone
to
heaven
the
room
was
heavy
with
soothing
antiseptic
odours
and
she
seemed
to
be
suspended
in
a
vapoury
cloud
on
the
edge
of
the
cloud
hovered
miss
evelina
veiled
and
aunt
hitty
who
was
most
assuredly
crying
there
was
a
stranger
too
and
araminta
gazed
at
him
questioningly
doctor
ralph
hand
firm
and
cool
closed
over
hers
do
you
remember
me
araminta
he
asked
much
as
one
would
speak
to
a
child
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
were
hanging
out
a
basket
of
clothes
the
grass
was
very
green
and
the
sky
was
a
bright
blue
and
the
petals
of
apple
blossoms
were
drifting
all
round
your
feet
i
called
to
you
and
you
ran
into
the
house
now
i
got
you
where
you
ca
get
away
araminta
pale
cheeks
flushed
she
looked
pleadingly
at
aunt
hitty
who
had
always
valiantly
defended
her
from
the
encroachments
of
boys
and
men
you
come
downstairs
with
me
ralph
dexter
commanded
aunt
hitty
i
got
some
talking
to
do
to
you
evelina
you
set
here
with
araminta
till
i
get
back
miss
evelina
drew
a
damp
freshly
scrubbed
chair
to
the
bedside
i
fell
off
the
did
i
asked
araminta
vaguely
yes
dear
miss
evelina
voice
was
very
low
and
sweet
you
fell
but
you
all
right
now
you
going
to
stay
here
until
you
get
well
aunt
hitty
and
i
are
going
to
take
care
of
you
in
the
cobwebbed
parlour
meanwhile
doctor
ralph
was
in
the
hands
of
the
attorney
for
the
prosecution
who
questioned
him
ceaselessly
what
wrong
with
minty
broken
ankle
how
did
it
happen
to
get
broke
demanded
miss
hitty
with
harshness
i
never
knew
an
ankle
to
get
broke
by
falling
off
a
ladder
any
ankle
will
break
temporised
ralph
if
it
is
hurt
at
the
right
point
i
wish
i
could
have
had
your
father
father
was
there
returned
ralph
secretly
amused
you
had
to
take
me
miss
hitty
face
softened
there
were
other
reasons
why
she
could
not
have
had
ralph
father
when
can
minty
go
home
minty
ca
go
home
until
she
well
she
got
to
stay
right
here
if
she
fell
in
the
yard
asked
miss
hitty
peering
keenly
at
him
over
her
spectacles
would
she
have
had
to
stay
in
the
yard
till
she
got
well
the
merest
suspicion
of
a
dimple
crept
into
the
corner
of
doctor
ralph
mouth
his
eyes
danced
but
otherwise
his
face
was
very
grave
she
would
he
said
in
his
best
professional
manner
a
shed
would
have
had
to
be
built
over
her
he
fancied
that
miss
hitty
constant
presence
might
prove
disastrous
to
a
nervous
patient
he
liked
the
quiet
veiled
woman
who
obeyed
his
orders
without
question
how
much
demanded
miss
mehitable
is
it
going
to
cost
i
do
know
answered
ralph
honestly
i
have
to
come
every
day
for
a
long
time
perhaps
twice
a
day
he
added
remembering
the
curve
of
araminta
cheek
and
her
long
dark
lashes
miss
hitty
made
an
indescribable
sound
pain
fear
disbelief
and
contempt
were
all
mingled
in
it
do
worry
said
ralph
kindly
you
know
doctoring
sometimes
comes
by
wholesale
miss
hitty
relief
was
instantaneous
and
evident
there
regular
prices
i
suppose
she
said
broken
toe
broken
ankle
broken
leg
each
one
so
much
is
that
it
doctor
ralph
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
how
much
is
ankles
demanded
his
inquisitor
i
leave
that
all
to
you
miss
hitty
said
ralph
when
he
recovered
his
composure
you
can
pay
me
whatever
you
think
is
right
i
should
pay
you
anything
i
did
think
was
right
she
returned
sharply
unless
i
was
made
to
by
law
as
long
as
you
got
to
come
every
day
for
a
spell
and
mebbe
twice
i
give
you
five
dollars
the
day
minty
walks
again
if
that
wo
do
i
get
the
doctor
over
to
the
ridge
doctor
ralph
coughed
so
hard
that
he
was
obliged
to
cover
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
i
should
think
said
miss
mehitable
that
if
you
were
as
good
a
doctor
as
you
pretend
to
be
you
cure
your
own
coughin
spells
first
thing
you
know
you
be
running
into
quick
consumption
will
five
dollars
do
ralph
bowed
but
his
face
was
very
red
and
he
appeared
to
be
struggling
with
some
secret
emotion
i
could
think
of
taking
as
much
as
five
dollars
miss
hitty
he
said
gallantly
i
should
not
have
ventured
to
suggest
over
four
and
a
half
he
cheaper
than
his
father
thought
miss
hitty
quickly
suspicious
that
because
he
ai
as
good
a
doctor
four
and
a
half
then
she
said
aloud
is
it
a
bargain
it
is
said
ralph
and
i
take
the
best
possible
care
of
araminta
shake
hands
on
it
he
went
out
his
shoulders
shaking
with
suppressed
merriment
and
miss
hitty
watched
him
through
the
grimy
front
window
seems
sort
of
decent
she
thought
and
not
too
grasping
he
might
be
real
nice
if
he
was
a
man
x
ralph
first
case
father
said
ralph
at
breakfast
i
got
my
first
case
yesterday
anthony
dexter
smiled
at
the
tall
straight
young
fellow
who
sat
opposite
him
he
did
not
care
about
the
case
but
he
found
endless
satisfaction
in
ralph
what
was
it
he
asked
idly
broken
ankle
i
only
happened
to
get
it
because
you
were
out
i
was
accused
of
being
a
doctor
but
under
the
circumstances
i
had
to
do
miss
mehitable
queried
doctor
dexter
with
lifted
brows
i
would
have
thought
her
ankles
could
be
broken
by
anything
short
of
machinery
guess
they
could
laughed
ralph
anyhow
they
were
all
right
at
last
accounts
it
araminta
the
pretty
little
thing
who
lives
with
the
dragon
oh
there
was
the
merest
shade
of
tenderness
in
the
exclamation
how
did
it
happen
divesting
the
circumstance
of
all
irrelevant
material
returned
ralph
reaching
for
another
crisp
roll
it
was
like
this
with
true
missionary
spirit
and
in
the
belief
that
cleanliness
is
closely
related
to
godliness
miss
mehitable
determined
to
clean
the
old
house
on
the
hill
the
shack
has
been
empty
a
long
time
but
now
has
a
tenant
of
whom
more
anon
miss
mehitable
own
mansion
it
seems
has
been
scrubbed
inside
and
out
and
painted
and
varnished
and
generally
torn
up
even
though
it
is
early
in
the
year
for
such
unholy
doings
having
finished
her
own
premises
and
still
having
strength
in
her
elbow
and
the
housecleaning
microbe
being
yet
on
an
unchecked
rampage
through
her
virtuous
system
and
there
being
some
soap
left
miss
mehitable
wanders
up
to
the
house
with
her
pail
shackled
to
her
also
with
a
pail
is
the
helpless
araminta
among
the
impedimenta
are
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
and
the
the
reverend
thorpe
being
dismissed
at
the
door
and
allowed
to
run
amuck
for
the
day
the
penates
are
duly
thrown
out
of
the
windows
the
veiled
chatelaine
sitting
by
mute
and
helpless
one
room
is
scrubbed
till
it
so
clean
a
fly
would
fall
down
in
it
and
the
ministering
angel
goes
back
to
her
own
spotless
residence
after
bedding
i
believe
i
did
understand
exactly
why
she
went
after
the
bedding
but
i
can
doubtless
find
out
the
next
time
i
see
miss
mehitable
in
the
absence
of
the
superintendent
araminta
seizes
the
opportunity
to
fall
off
the
top
of
the
ladder
lighting
on
her
ankle
and
fainting
most
completely
on
the
way
down
the
rest
is
history
doctor
dexter
being
out
his
son
perforce
has
to
serve
the
ankle
being
duly
set
and
the
excitement
allayed
terms
are
made
in
private
with
the
doctor
how
much
father
do
you
suppose
i
am
to
be
paid
the
day
araminta
walks
again
doctor
dexter
dismissed
the
question
could
guess
he
grunted
four
and
a
half
said
ralph
proudly
hundred
asked
doctor
dexter
with
a
gleam
of
interest
you
must
have
imbibed
high
notions
at
college
hundred
shouted
ralph
heavens
no
four
dollars
and
a
half
four
dollars
and
fifty
cents
marked
down
from
five
for
this
day
only
special
remnant
sale
of
repaired
ankles
the
boy
literally
doubled
himself
in
his
merriment
you
bloated
bondholder
said
his
father
fondly
do
be
extravagant
with
it
i
wo
returned
ralph
between
gasps
i
thought
i
put
some
of
it
into
unincumbered
real
estate
and
loan
the
rest
on
good
security
at
five
per
cent
into
the
lonely
house
ralph
laughter
came
like
the
embodied
spirit
of
youth
it
searched
out
the
hidden
corners
illuminated
the
shadows
stirred
the
silences
to
music
a
sunbeam
danced
on
the
stair
where
according
to
doctor
dexter
recollection
no
sunbeam
had
ever
dared
to
dance
before
ah
it
was
good
to
have
the
boy
at
home
miss
mehitable
observed
doctor
dexter
after
a
pause
is
like
the
poor
always
with
us
i
seldom
get
to
a
patient
who
is
really
in
danger
before
she
does
she
seems
to
have
secret
wires
stretched
all
over
the
country
and
she
has
the
clinical
history
of
the
neighbourhood
at
her
tongue
end
what
more
she
distributes
it
continually
painstakingly
untiringly
every
detail
of
every
case
i
have
charge
of
is
spread
broadcast
by
miss
mehitable
i
have
a
bad
reputation
professionally
if
so
much
about
my
patients
was
generally
known
anywhere
else
is
she
a
good
nurse
asked
ralph
according
to
her
light
yes
but
she
is
willing
to
work
on
recognised
lines
she
dose
my
patients
with
roots
and
herbs
of
her
own
concocting
if
she
gets
a
chance
and
proudly
claim
credit
for
the
cure
if
the
patient
dies
everybody
blames
me
i
ca
sit
by
a
case
of
measles
and
keep
miss
mehitable
from
throwing
sassafras
tea
into
it
more
than
ten
hours
at
a
stretch
why
do
you
talk
to
her
queried
ralph
talk
to
her
snorted
doctor
dexter
do
you
suppose
i
ruptured
my
vocal
cords
more
than
once
i
might
just
as
well
put
my
head
out
of
the
front
window
and
whisper
it
as
to
talk
to
her
she
wo
monkey
with
my
case
said
ralph
his
mouth
was
firmly
set
wo
she
parried
doctor
dexter
sarcastically
you
go
up
there
and
see
if
the
cast
is
off
and
the
fracture
being
fomented
with
pennyroyal
tea
or
some
such
mess
i
always
had
an
impression
said
ralph
thoughtfully
that
people
were
afraid
of
you
they
are
grunted
doctor
dexter
but
miss
mehitable
is
she
goes
by
herself
and
is
afraid
of
man
or
devil
if
i
had
horns
and
a
barbed
tail
and
breathed
smoke
i
could
scare
her
the
patient
family
being
more
afraid
of
her
than
of
me
invariably
give
her
free
access
to
the
i
do
want
her
to
worry
araminta
said
ralph
if
you
do
want
araminta
worried
replied
doctor
dexter
conclusively
you
better
put
a
few
things
into
your
suit
case
and
move
up
there
until
she
walks
all
right
said
ralph
i
here
to
rout
your
malign
influence
it
me
to
sit
by
araminta
crib
and
scare
the
old
girl
off
i
bet
i
can
fix
her
if
you
can
returned
doctor
dexter
you
are
considerably
more
intelligent
than
i
take
you
to
be
with
the
welfare
of
his
young
patient
very
earnestly
at
heart
ralph
went
up
the
hill
miss
evelina
admitted
him
and
ralph
drew
her
into
the
dusty
parlour
can
you
take
care
of
anybody
he
inquired
without
preliminary
can
you
follow
directions
i
think
so
then
ralph
went
on
i
turn
araminta
over
to
you
miss
mehitable
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
from
this
moment
araminta
is
in
your
care
and
mine
you
take
directions
from
me
and
from
nobody
else
do
you
understand
yes
whispered
miss
evelina
but
mehitable
wo
wo
let
me
wo
let
you
nothing
said
ralph
scornfully
she
to
be
kept
out
she
she
stammered
miss
evelina
she
up
there
now
ralph
started
upstairs
up
he
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
and
went
up
more
quietly
he
stepped
lightly
along
the
hall
and
stood
just
outside
araminta
door
shamelessly
listening
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
an
indignant
feminine
voice
the
idea
of
a
big
girl
like
you
not
bein
able
to
stand
on
a
ladder
without
fallin
off
it
your
mother
foolishness
cropping
out
in
you
after
all
i
done
for
you
i
stood
on
ladders
all
my
life
and
never
so
much
as
slipped
i
believe
you
did
it
a
purpose
though
what
you
thought
you
get
for
doin
it
puzzles
me
some
you
thought
you
get
out
of
the
housecleanin
but
you
wo
when
it
comes
time
for
the
fall
cleanin
you
do
every
stroke
yourself
to
pay
for
all
this
trouble
and
expense
do
you
know
what
it
costin
four
dollars
and
a
half
of
good
money
i
should
think
you
be
ashamed
but
aunt
hitty
began
the
girl
pleadingly
stop
do
you
hitty
me
continued
the
angry
voice
you
need
tell
me
you
did
fall
off
that
ladder
a
purpose
four
dollars
and
a
half
and
all
the
trouble
besides
i
hope
you
think
of
that
while
you
laying
here
like
a
lady
and
your
poor
old
aunt
is
slavin
for
you
workin
her
fingers
to
the
bone
if
i
can
ever
get
the
four
dollars
and
a
half
cried
araminta
with
tears
in
her
voice
i
will
give
it
back
to
you
oh
indeed
i
will
at
this
point
doctor
ralph
dexter
entered
the
room
his
eyes
snapping
dangerously
miss
mehitable
he
said
with
forced
calmness
will
you
kindly
come
downstairs
a
moment
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
dazed
and
startled
miss
mehitable
rose
from
her
chair
and
followed
him
there
was
in
ralph
voice
a
quality
which
literally
compelled
obedience
he
drew
her
into
the
dusty
parlour
and
closed
all
the
doors
carefully
miss
evelina
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
was
standing
in
the
hall
said
ralph
coolly
and
i
heard
every
word
you
said
to
that
poor
helpless
child
you
ought
to
know
if
you
know
anything
at
all
that
nobody
ever
fell
off
a
on
purpose
she
hurt
and
she
badly
hurt
and
she
not
in
any
way
to
blame
for
it
and
i
positively
forbid
you
ever
to
enter
that
room
again
forbid
bristled
aunt
hitty
who
are
you
she
demanded
sarcastically
to
me
from
nursing
my
own
niece
i
am
the
attending
physician
returned
ralph
calmly
it
is
my
case
and
nobody
else
is
going
to
manage
it
i
have
already
arranged
with
the
lady
who
lives
here
to
take
care
of
araminta
and
arrange
no
such
thing
interrupted
miss
hitty
violently
her
temper
was
getting
away
from
her
one
moment
interrupted
ralph
if
i
hear
of
your
entering
that
room
again
before
i
say
araminta
is
cured
i
will
charge
you
just
exactly
one
hundred
dollars
for
my
services
and
collect
it
by
law
miss
hitty
lower
jaw
dropped
her
strong
body
shook
she
gazed
at
ralph
as
one
might
look
at
an
intimate
friend
gone
suddenly
daft
she
had
heard
of
people
who
lost
their
reason
without
warning
was
it
possible
that
she
was
in
the
room
with
a
lunatic
she
edged
toward
the
door
keeping
her
eyes
on
ralph
he
anticipated
her
and
opened
it
with
a
polite
flourish
remember
he
warned
her
one
step
into
araminta
room
one
word
addressed
to
her
and
it
costs
you
just
exactly
one
hundred
dollars
he
opened
the
other
door
and
pointed
suggestively
down
the
hill
she
lost
no
time
in
obeying
the
gesture
but
scudded
down
the
road
as
though
his
satanic
majesty
himself
was
in
her
wake
ralph
laughed
to
himself
all
the
way
upstairs
but
in
the
hall
he
paused
and
his
face
grew
grave
again
from
araminta
room
came
the
sound
of
sobbing
she
did
not
see
him
enter
for
her
face
was
hidden
in
her
pillow
araminta
said
ralph
tenderly
you
poor
child
touched
by
the
unexpected
sympathy
araminta
raised
her
head
to
look
at
him
oh
doctor
she
began
doctor
ralph
said
the
young
man
sitting
down
on
the
bed
beside
her
my
father
is
doctor
dexter
and
i
am
doctor
ralph
i
ashamed
of
myself
for
being
such
a
baby
sobbed
araminta
i
did
mean
to
cry
you
not
a
baby
at
all
said
doctor
ralph
soothingly
taking
her
hot
hand
in
his
you
hurt
and
you
been
bothered
and
if
you
want
to
cry
you
can
here
my
handkerchief
after
a
little
her
sobs
ceased
doctor
ralph
still
sat
there
regarding
her
with
a
sort
of
questioning
tenderness
which
was
entirely
outside
of
araminta
brief
experience
you
not
to
be
bothered
any
more
he
said
i
seen
your
aunt
and
she
not
to
set
foot
in
this
room
again
until
you
get
well
if
she
even
speaks
to
you
from
the
hall
you
to
tell
me
araminta
gazed
at
him
and
troubled
i
ca
take
care
of
myself
she
said
with
a
pathetic
little
smile
you
not
going
to
the
lady
who
lives
here
is
going
to
take
care
of
you
miss
evelina
she
got
burned
because
she
was
bad
and
she
has
to
wear
a
veil
all
the
time
how
was
she
bad
asked
ralph
i
do
just
know
whispered
araminta
cautiously
aunt
hitty
did
know
or
else
she
would
tell
me
but
she
was
bad
she
went
to
a
man
house
she
then
araminta
remembered
that
it
was
doctor
dexter
house
to
which
miss
evelina
had
gone
in
shame
and
terror
she
hid
her
face
again
i
do
believe
anybody
ever
got
burned
just
for
being
bad
ralph
was
saying
but
your
face
is
hot
and
i
going
to
cool
it
for
you
he
brought
a
bowl
of
cold
water
and
with
his
handkerchief
bathed
araminta
flushed
face
and
her
hot
hands
does
that
feel
good
he
asked
when
the
traces
of
tears
had
been
practically
removed
yes
sighed
araminta
gratefully
but
i
always
washed
my
own
face
before
i
saw
a
cat
once
she
continued
he
was
washing
his
children
faces
must
have
been
a
lady
cat
observed
ralph
with
a
smile
the
little
cats
pursued
araminta
looked
to
be
very
soft
i
think
they
liked
it
they
are
soft
admitted
ralph
do
you
think
so
i
do
know
i
never
had
a
little
cat
never
had
a
kitten
cried
ralph
you
poor
defrauded
child
what
kind
of
a
kitten
would
you
like
best
a
little
grey
cat
said
araminta
seriously
a
little
grey
cat
with
blue
eyes
but
aunt
hitty
would
never
let
me
have
one
see
here
said
ralph
aunt
hitty
is
running
this
show
stage
manager
and
ticket
taker
and
advance
man
and
everything
else
all
rolled
into
one
i
ca
promise
positively
because
i
not
posted
on
the
cat
supply
around
here
but
if
i
can
find
one
you
shall
have
a
grey
kitten
with
blue
eyes
and
you
shall
have
some
kind
of
a
kitten
anyhow
oh
cried
araminta
her
eyes
shining
truly
truly
nodded
ralph
would
would
hesitated
araminta
would
it
be
any
more
than
four
dollars
and
a
half
if
you
brought
me
the
little
cat
because
if
it
is
i
ca
it
would
interrupted
ralph
on
any
bill
over
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
i
always
throw
in
a
kitten
did
you
know
that
no
answered
araminta
with
a
happy
little
laugh
how
kind
he
was
eyen
though
he
was
a
man
perhaps
if
he
knew
how
wicked
her
mother
had
been
he
would
not
be
so
kind
to
her
the
stern
puritan
conscience
rose
up
and
demanded
explanation
i
i
must
tell
you
she
said
before
you
bring
me
the
little
cat
my
mother
she
here
araminta
turned
her
crimson
face
away
she
swallowed
a
lump
in
her
throat
then
said
bravely
my
mother
was
married
doctor
ralph
dexter
laughed
a
deep
hearty
boyish
laugh
that
rang
cheerfully
through
the
empty
house
i
tell
you
something
he
said
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
in
her
ear
so
was
mine
araminta
face
betrayed
her
relief
he
knew
the
worst
now
and
he
was
similarly
branded
his
mother
too
had
been
an
outcast
beyond
aunt
hitty
pale
there
was
comfort
in
the
thought
though
araminta
had
been
taught
not
to
rejoice
at
another
misfortune
ralph
strolled
off
down
the
hill
his
hands
in
his
pockets
for
the
moment
totally
forgetting
the
promised
kitten
the
little
saint
he
mused
she
been
kept
in
a
cage
all
her
life
she
does
know
anything
except
what
the
dragon
has
taught
her
she
looks
at
life
with
the
dragon
sidewise
squint
i
open
the
door
for
her
he
continued
mentally
for
i
think
she
worth
saving
hope
to
moses
and
the
prophets
i
do
forget
that
cat
no
suspicion
that
he
could
forget
penetrated
araminta
consciousness
it
had
been
pleasant
to
have
doctor
ralph
sit
there
and
wash
her
face
talking
to
her
meanwhile
even
though
he
was
a
man
and
men
were
poison
like
a
strong
sure
bond
between
them
araminta
felt
their
common
disgrace
his
mother
was
married
she
thought
drowsily
and
so
was
mine
neither
of
them
knew
any
better
oh
lord
prayed
araminta
with
renewed
vigour
keep
me
from
the
contamination
of
marriage
for
thy
sake
amen
xi
the
loose
link
seated
primly
on
a
chair
in
miss
evelina
kitchen
miss
mehitable
gave
a
full
account
of
her
sentiments
toward
doctor
ralph
dexter
she
began
with
his
birth
and
remarked
that
he
was
a
puny
infant
and
for
a
time
it
was
feared
that
he
was
light
headed
he
got
his
senses
after
a
while
though
she
continued
grudgingly
that
is
such
as
they
are
she
proceeded
through
his
repeated
unflattering
opinions
which
his
teachers
had
expressed
to
her
gave
an
elaborate
description
of
the
conflict
that
ensued
when
she
caught
him
stealing
green
apples
from
her
incipient
though
highly
promising
orchard
alluded
darkly
to
his
tendency
to
fight
with
his
schoolmates
suggested
that
certain
thefts
of
chickens
ten
years
and
more
ago
could
if
the
truth
were
known
safely
be
attributed
to
ralph
dexter
and
speculated
upon
the
trials
and
tribulations
a
scapegrace
son
might
cause
an
upright
and
respected
father
all
the
dead
and
buried
crimes
of
the
small
boys
of
the
village
were
excavated
from
the
past
and
charged
to
ralph
dexter
miss
mehitable
brought
the
record
fully
up
to
the
time
he
left
rushton
for
college
having
been
prepared
for
entrance
by
his
father
then
she
began
with
araminta
first
upon
the
schedule
were
miss
mehitable
painful
emotions
when
barbara
smith
had
married
henry
lee
she
croaked
anew
all
her
prophecies
of
misfortune
which
had
added
excitement
to
the
wedding
and
brought
forth
the
birth
of
araminta
in
full
proof
full
details
of
barbara
death
were
given
and
the
highly
magnified
events
which
had
led
to
her
adoption
of
the
child
condescending
for
a
moment
to
speak
of
the
domestic
virtues
miss
mehitable
explained
with
proper
pride
how
she
had
brought
up
araminta
the
child
had
been
kept
close
at
the
side
of
her
guardian
angel
never
had
been
to
school
had
been
carefully
taught
at
home
had
not
been
allowed
to
play
with
other
children
in
short
save
at
extremely
rare
intervals
araminta
had
seen
no
one
unless
in
the
watchful
presence
of
her
counsellor
and
if
you
do
think
that
work
observed
miss
hitty
piously
you
just
keep
tied
to
one
person
for
almost
nineteen
years
day
and
night
never
lettin
out
of
your
sight
and
layin
the
foundation
of
their
manners
and
morals
and
education
and
see
how
you
feel
when
a
blackmailing
sprig
of
a
threatens
to
collect
a
hundred
dollars
from
you
if
you
dast
to
nurse
your
own
niece
miss
evelina
silent
as
always
was
moving
restlessly
about
the
kitchen
unaccustomed
since
her
girlhood
to
activity
of
any
description
she
found
her
new
tasks
hard
muscles
long
unused
ached
miserably
from
exertion
yet
araminta
had
to
be
taken
care
of
and
her
room
kept
clean
the
daily
visits
of
doctor
ralph
who
was
almost
painfully
neat
had
made
miss
evelina
ashamed
of
her
house
though
he
had
not
appeared
to
notice
that
anything
was
wrong
she
avoided
him
when
she
could
but
it
was
not
always
possible
for
directions
had
to
be
given
and
reports
made
miss
evelina
never
looked
at
him
directly
one
look
into
his
eyes
so
like
his
father
had
made
her
so
faint
that
she
would
have
fallen
had
not
doctor
ralph
steadied
her
with
his
strong
arm
to
her
he
was
anthony
dexter
in
the
days
of
his
youth
though
she
continually
wondered
to
find
it
so
she
remembered
a
story
she
had
read
a
long
time
ago
of
a
young
woman
who
lost
her
husband
of
a
few
weeks
in
a
singularly
pathetic
manner
in
exploring
a
mountain
he
fell
into
a
crevasse
and
his
body
could
not
be
recovered
scientists
calculated
that
at
the
rate
the
glacier
was
moving
his
body
might
be
expected
to
appear
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
in
about
years
so
grimly
the
young
bride
set
herself
to
wait
at
the
appointed
time
the
glacier
gave
up
its
dead
in
perfect
preservation
owing
to
the
intense
cold
but
the
woman
who
had
waited
for
her
husband
thus
was
years
older
she
had
aged
and
he
was
still
young
in
some
such
way
had
anthony
dexter
come
back
to
her
eager
boyish
knowing
none
of
life
except
its
joy
while
she
a
quarter
of
a
century
older
had
borne
incredible
griefs
been
wasted
by
long
vigils
and
now
stood
desolate
at
the
tomb
of
a
love
which
was
not
dead
but
continually
tore
at
its
winding
sheet
and
prayed
for
release
to
evelina
at
times
the
past
years
seemed
like
a
long
nightmare
this
was
anthony
dexter
this
boy
with
the
quick
light
step
the
ringing
laugh
the
broad
shoulders
and
clear
true
eyes
no
terror
lay
between
them
all
was
straight
and
right
yet
the
realisation
still
enshrouded
her
like
a
black
cloud
and
said
miss
hitty
mournfully
after
ail
my
patience
and
hard
work
in
bringing
up
araminta
as
a
lady
should
be
brought
up
and
having
taught
her
to
beware
of
men
and
even
of
boys
she
took
away
from
me
when
she
sick
and
nobody
allowed
to
see
her
except
a
blackmailing
who
is
putting
heaven
knows
what
devilment
into
her
head
i
suppose
there
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
finishing
the
housecleaning
if
i
do
speak
to
my
own
niece
as
i
pass
her
door
she
spoke
inquiringly
but
miss
evelina
did
not
reply
most
folks
continued
miss
hitty
with
asperity
is
pleased
enough
to
have
their
houses
cleaned
for
to
say
you
but
i
some
accustomed
to
ingratitude
what
i
do
now
in
the
way
of
cleanin
will
be
payin
for
the
nursin
of
araminta
still
miss
evelina
did
not
answer
her
thoughts
being
far
away
maybe
i
did
speak
cross
to
minty
admitted
miss
hitty
grudgingly
at
a
time
when
i
had
no
business
to
if
i
did
i
willin
to
tell
her
so
but
not
that
blackmailing
with
a
bill
for
a
club
i
was
clean
out
of
patience
with
minty
for
falling
off
the
ladder
but
i
guess
as
he
says
she
did
go
for
to
do
it
ai
in
reason
for
folks
to
step
off
ladders
or
out
of
windows
unless
they
walkin
in
their
sleep
and
i
never
let
minty
sleep
in
the
daytime
unceasingly
miss
mehitable
prattled
on
reminiscence
anecdote
and
philosophical
observations
succeeded
one
another
with
startling
rapidity
ending
always
in
vituperation
and
epithet
directed
toward
araminta
physician
dark
allusions
to
the
base
ingratitude
of
everybody
with
whom
miss
hitty
had
ever
been
concerned
alternately
cumbered
her
speech
at
length
the
persistent
sound
wore
upon
miss
evelina
much
as
the
vibration
of
sound
may
distress
one
totally
deaf
the
kitchen
door
was
open
and
miss
evelina
went
outdoors
miss
mehitable
continued
to
converse
then
shortly
perceived
that
she
was
alone
well
i
never
she
gasped
guess
i
go
home
her
back
was
very
stiff
and
straight
when
she
marched
downhill
firmly
determined
to
abandon
evelina
scorn
doctor
ralph
dexter
and
leave
araminta
to
her
fate
one
thought
and
one
only
illuminated
her
gloom
he
ai
got
his
four
dollars
and
a
half
yet
she
chuckled
craftily
mebbe
he
get
it
and
mebbe
he
wo
we
see
while
straying
about
the
garden
miss
evelina
saw
her
unwelcome
guest
take
her
militant
departure
and
reproached
herself
for
her
lack
of
hospitality
miss
mehitable
had
been
very
kind
to
her
and
deserved
only
kindness
in
return
she
had
acted
upon
impulse
and
was
ashamed
miss
evelina
meditated
calling
her
back
but
the
long
years
of
and
inactivity
had
left
her
inert
with
capacity
only
for
suffering
that
very
suffering
to
which
she
had
become
accustomed
had
of
late
assumed
fresh
phases
she
was
hurt
continually
in
new
ways
yet
after
the
first
shock
of
returning
to
her
old
home
not
so
much
as
she
had
expected
it
is
a
way
of
life
and
one
of
its
inmost
compensations
this
finding
of
a
reality
so
much
easier
than
our
fears
april
had
come
over
the
hills
singing
with
a
tinkle
of
rain
and
a
rush
of
warm
winds
and
yet
the
piper
had
not
returned
his
tools
were
in
the
shed
and
the
mountain
of
rubbish
was
still
in
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
half
of
the
garden
had
not
been
touched
on
one
side
of
the
house
was
the
bare
brown
earth
with
tiny
green
shoots
springing
up
through
it
and
on
the
other
was
a
years
growth
of
weeds
miss
evelina
reflected
that
the
place
was
not
unlike
her
own
life
half
of
it
full
of
promise
a
forbidding
wreck
in
the
midst
of
it
and
beyond
it
desolation
ended
only
by
a
stone
wall
did
you
think
asked
a
cheerful
voice
at
her
elbow
that
i
was
never
coming
back
to
finish
my
job
miss
evelina
started
and
gazed
into
the
round
smiling
face
of
piper
tom
who
was
accompanied
as
always
by
his
faithful
dog
is
not
our
way
he
went
on
including
the
yellow
mongrel
in
the
pronoun
to
leave
undone
what
we
set
our
hands
and
paws
to
do
eh
laddie
he
waited
a
moment
but
miss
evelina
did
not
speak
i
got
some
seeds
for
my
garden
he
continued
taking
bulging
parcels
from
the
pockets
of
his
short
shaggy
coat
the
year
sorrow
is
at
an
end
sorrow
never
comes
to
an
end
she
cried
bitterly
does
it
he
asked
how
old
is
yours
years
she
answered
choking
the
horror
of
it
was
pressing
heavily
upon
her
then
said
the
piper
very
gently
i
thinking
there
is
something
wrong
no
sorrow
should
last
more
than
a
year
is
written
all
around
us
so
written
i
have
never
seen
it
written
no
returned
the
piper
kindly
but
is
because
you
have
not
looked
to
see
have
you
ever
known
a
tree
that
failed
to
put
out
its
green
leaves
in
the
spring
unless
it
had
died
from
lightning
or
old
age
when
a
rose
blossoms
then
goes
to
sleep
does
it
wait
for
more
than
a
year
before
it
blooms
again
is
it
more
than
a
year
from
bud
to
bud
from
flower
to
flower
from
fruit
to
fruit
is
god
way
of
showing
that
a
year
of
darkness
is
enough
at
a
time
the
piper
voice
was
very
tender
the
little
dog
lay
still
at
his
feet
she
leaned
against
the
crumbling
wall
and
turned
her
veiled
face
away
is
not
for
us
to
be
happy
without
trying
continued
the
piper
any
more
than
it
is
for
a
tree
to
bear
fruit
without
effort
all
the
beauty
and
joy
in
the
world
are
the
result
of
work
work
for
each
other
and
in
ourselves
when
you
see
a
butterfly
over
a
field
of
clover
is
because
he
has
worked
to
get
out
of
his
chrysalis
he
was
not
content
to
abide
within
his
veil
suppose
said
miss
evelina
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
that
he
could
get
out
ah
but
he
could
answered
the
piper
we
can
get
out
of
anything
if
we
try
i
not
meaning
by
escape
but
by
growth
you
put
an
acorn
into
a
crevice
in
a
rock
it
has
no
wings
it
can
not
fly
out
nobody
will
lift
it
out
but
it
grows
and
the
oak
splits
the
rock
even
takes
from
the
rock
nourishment
for
its
root
people
are
not
like
acorns
and
butterflies
she
stammered
we
are
not
subject
to
the
same
laws
why
not
asked
the
piper
god
made
us
all
and
i
thinking
all
brothers
having
in
a
way
the
same
father
is
not
for
me
to
hold
myself
above
laddie
here
though
he
a
dog
and
i
a
man
is
not
for
me
to
say
that
men
are
better
than
dogs
that
they
more
honest
more
true
more
kind
the
seed
that
i
have
in
my
hand
here
i
thinking
is
my
brother
too
if
i
plant
it
water
it
and
keep
the
weeds
away
from
it
will
give
me
back
a
blossom
is
service
binds
us
all
into
the
brotherhood
did
you
never
asked
evelina
thickly
hear
of
chains
aye
said
the
piper
chains
of
our
own
making
is
like
the
ancient
people
in
one
of
my
ragged
books
when
one
man
killed
another
they
chained
the
dead
man
to
the
living
one
so
that
he
was
forever
dragging
his
own
sin
when
he
struck
the
blow
he
made
his
own
chain
i
am
chained
cried
evelina
piteously
but
not
to
my
own
sin
is
wrong
said
the
piper
i
thinking
there
a
loose
link
somewhere
that
can
be
slipped
off
i
can
not
find
it
she
sobbed
i
hunted
for
it
in
the
dark
for
years
poor
soul
said
the
piper
softly
is
because
of
the
darkness
i
thinking
from
the
distaff
of
eternity
you
take
the
thread
of
your
life
but
you
sitting
in
the
night
and
god
meant
you
to
be
a
spinner
in
the
sun
when
the
day
breaks
for
you
you
be
finding
the
loose
link
to
set
yourself
free
when
the
day
breaks
repeated
evelina
in
a
whisper
there
is
no
day
there
is
day
i
come
to
lead
you
to
it
we
find
the
light
together
and
set
the
thread
to
going
right
again
who
are
you
cried
evelina
suddenly
terror
stricken
the
piper
laughed
a
low
deep
friendly
laugh
then
he
doffed
his
grey
hat
and
bowed
sweeping
the
earth
with
the
red
feather
in
cavalier
fashion
tom
barnaby
at
your
service
but
most
folks
call
me
piper
tom
is
the
flute
you
know
he
continued
in
explanation
that
i
forever
playing
on
in
the
woods
having
no
knowledge
of
the
instrument
but
sort
of
liking
the
sound
miss
evelina
turned
and
went
into
the
house
shaken
to
her
inmost
soul
more
than
ever
she
felt
the
chains
that
bound
her
straining
against
her
bonds
she
felt
them
cutting
deep
into
her
flesh
anthony
dexter
had
bound
her
he
alone
could
set
her
free
from
this
there
seemed
no
possible
appeal
meanwhile
the
piper
mowed
down
the
weeds
in
the
garden
whistling
cheerily
he
burned
the
rubbish
in
the
road
and
the
smoke
made
a
blue
haze
on
the
hill
he
spaded
and
raked
and
found
new
stones
for
the
broken
wall
and
kept
up
a
constant
conversation
with
the
dog
it
was
twilight
long
before
he
got
ready
to
make
the
flower
beds
so
he
carried
the
tools
back
into
the
shed
and
safely
stored
away
the
seeds
miss
evelina
watched
him
from
the
grimy
front
window
as
he
started
downhill
but
he
did
not
once
look
back
there
was
something
jaunty
in
the
piper
manner
aside
from
the
drooping
red
feather
which
bobbed
rakishly
as
he
went
home
whistling
when
he
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
miss
evelina
sighed
something
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
her
life
like
a
sunbeam
which
has
suddenly
faded
in
a
safe
shadow
of
the
house
she
raised
her
veil
and
wiped
away
a
tear
when
out
of
sight
and
hearing
the
piper
stopped
his
whistling
is
no
need
to
be
cheerful
laddie
he
explained
to
the
dog
when
none
to
be
saddened
if
you
not
we
do
know
about
the
loose
link
and
perhaps
we
can
never
find
it
but
we
going
to
try
we
take
off
the
chain
and
put
the
poor
soul
in
the
sun
again
before
we
go
away
if
we
can
learn
how
to
do
it
but
i
thinking
is
a
heavy
chain
and
the
sun
has
long
since
ceased
to
shine
after
supper
he
lighted
a
candle
and
absorbed
himself
in
going
over
his
stock
he
had
made
a
few
purchases
in
the
city
and
it
took
some
time
to
arrange
them
properly
last
of
all
he
took
out
a
box
and
opened
it
he
held
up
to
the
flickering
light
length
after
length
of
misty
white
chiffon
a
fabric
which
the
piper
had
never
bought
before
is
expensive
laddie
he
said
so
expensive
that
neither
of
us
will
taste
meat
again
for
more
than
a
week
though
we
walked
both
ways
but
i
thinking
she
need
more
sometime
and
there
was
none
to
be
had
here
we
not
be
in
the
way
of
charging
for
it
since
her
gown
is
shabby
and
her
shoes
are
worn
twilight
deepened
into
night
and
still
the
piper
sat
there
handling
the
chiffon
curiously
and
yet
with
reverence
it
was
silky
to
his
touch
filmy
he
folded
it
into
small
compass
and
crushed
it
in
his
hands
much
surprised
to
find
that
it
did
not
crumple
all
the
meaning
of
chiffon
communicated
itself
to
him
the
lightness
and
the
laughter
the
beauty
and
the
love
roses
and
moonlight
seemed
to
belong
with
it
youth
and
a
singing
heart
is
a
rare
stuff
i
thinking
laddie
he
said
at
length
not
noting
that
the
dog
was
asleep
is
a
rare
fine
stuff
and
well
suited
to
her
wearing
because
she
is
so
beautiful
that
she
hides
her
face
xii
a
grey
kitten
with
her
mouth
firmly
set
and
assuming
the
air
of
a
martyr
trying
to
make
himself
a
little
more
comfortable
against
the
stake
miss
mehitable
climbed
the
hill
in
her
capable
hands
were
the
implements
of
warfare
pails
yellow
soap
and
rags
she
carried
a
mop
on
her
shoulder
as
a
regular
carries
a
gun
havin
said
i
would
clean
house
i
will
clean
house
she
mused
in
spite
of
all
the
ingratitude
and
not
listenin
wo
take
long
and
it
do
my
heart
good
to
see
the
place
clean
again
evelina
got
no
gumption
about
a
house
never
did
have
i
she
thinks
clean
just
because
she
swept
it
and
brushed
down
the
cobwebs
but
it
needs
more
a
broom
to
take
out
years
dirt
her
militant
demeanour
was
somewhat
chastened
when
she
presented
herself
at
the
house
when
the
door
was
opened
she
brushed
past
miss
evelina
with
a
muttered
explanation
and
made
straight
for
the
kitchen
stove
she
heated
a
huge
kettle
of
water
filled
her
pail
and
then
for
the
first
time
spoke
i
come
to
finish
cleanin
as
i
promised
i
would
and
i
hope
offset
your
nursin
of
minty
and
if
that
blackmailing
comes
while
i
at
work
you
can
tell
him
that
i
ai
speakin
to
minty
from
the
hall
nor
settin
foot
in
her
room
and
that
he
be
in
any
hurry
to
make
out
his
bill
i
goin
to
take
my
time
about
payin
it
she
went
upstairs
briskly
and
presently
the
clatter
of
moving
furniture
fairly
shook
the
house
over
miss
evelina
head
it
sounded
as
if
miss
mehitable
did
not
know
there
was
an
invalid
in
the
house
and
found
distinct
pleasure
in
making
unnecessary
noise
the
quick
regular
strokes
of
the
scrubbing
brush
swished
through
the
hall
resentment
inspired
the
ministering
influence
to
speed
but
it
was
not
in
miss
hitty
nature
to
cherish
her
wrath
long
while
the
incense
of
yellow
soap
was
in
her
nostrils
and
the
pleasing
foam
of
suds
was
everywhere
in
sight
presently
she
began
to
sing
in
a
high
cracked
voice
which
wavered
continually
off
the
key
she
went
through
her
repertory
of
hymns
with
conscientious
thoroughness
then
a
bright
idea
came
to
her
there
nothin
said
about
singin
she
said
to
herself
i
to
speak
to
minty
from
the
hall
nor
set
foot
into
her
room
but
i
ai
pledged
not
to
sing
in
the
back
room
and
i
can
sing
any
tune
i
please
and
any
words
reckon
minty
can
hear
the
moving
of
the
ladder
drowned
the
sound
made
by
the
opening
of
the
lower
door
secure
upon
her
height
with
her
head
near
the
open
transom
of
the
back
room
miss
mehitable
began
to
sing
araminta
lee
is
a
bad
girl
she
warbled
to
a
tune
the
like
of
which
no
mortal
had
ever
heard
before
she
fell
off
of
a
and
sprained
her
and
the
said
it
was
broke
in
to
get
more
breaks
being
more
than
sprains
araminta
lee
is
in
bed
like
a
while
her
poor
old
aunt
works
her
fingers
to
the
bone
to
pay
for
bills
and
nursin
four
dollars
and
a
half
she
chanted
mournfully
and
to
pay
it
but
a
poor
old
aunt
who
has
to
work
her
to
the
bone
four
dollars
and
a
half
four
dollars
and
a
half
almost
five
dollars
araminta
thinks
she
will
get
out
of
work
by
pretending
to
be
sick
but
it
is
not
so
not
so
araminta
will
find
out
she
is
much
she
will
do
the
fall
all
alone
alone
and
we
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
sprained
nor
any
four
dollars
doctor
ralph
dexter
appeared
in
the
doorway
his
face
flaming
with
wrath
miss
mehitable
continued
to
sing
apparently
unconcerned
though
her
heart
pounded
violently
against
her
ribs
by
a
swift
change
of
words
and
music
she
was
singing
rock
of
ages
as
any
woman
is
privileged
to
do
when
cleaning
house
or
at
any
other
time
but
the
young
man
still
stood
there
his
angry
eyes
fixed
upon
her
the
scrutiny
made
miss
mehitable
uncomfortable
and
at
length
she
descended
from
the
ladder
still
singing
ostensibly
to
refill
her
pail
let
me
hide
warbled
miss
hitty
tremulously
attempting
to
leave
the
room
doctor
ralph
effectually
barred
the
way
i
should
think
you
want
to
hide
he
said
scornfully
if
i
hear
of
anything
like
this
again
i
send
in
that
bill
i
told
you
of
i
know
a
lawyer
who
can
collect
it
if
you
do
commented
miss
mehitable
ironically
you
know
more
i
do
she
tried
to
speak
with
assurance
but
her
soul
was
quaking
within
her
was
it
possible
that
any
one
knew
she
had
over
three
hundred
dollars
safely
concealed
in
the
attic
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
continued
ralph
if
you
so
much
as
climb
these
stairs
again
you
and
i
will
have
trouble
sniffing
disdainfully
miss
mehitable
went
down
into
the
kitchen
no
longer
singing
you
have
to
finish
your
own
cleanin
she
said
to
miss
evelina
that
blackmailing
thinks
it
ai
good
for
my
health
to
climb
ladders
he
afraid
i
fall
off
same
as
minty
did
and
he
hesitates
to
take
more
of
my
money
i
much
rather
you
would
do
any
more
replied
miss
evelina
kindly
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
ever
since
i
came
here
and
i
appreciate
it
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
going
to
clean
my
own
house
for
indeed
i
ashamed
of
it
miss
hitty
grunted
unintelligibly
gathered
up
her
paraphernalia
and
prepared
to
depart
when
minty
well
she
said
i
come
back
and
be
neighbourly
i
hope
you
come
before
that
responded
miss
evelina
i
shall
miss
you
if
you
do
miss
hitty
affected
not
to
hear
but
she
was
mollified
none
the
less
from
his
patient
window
doctor
ralph
observed
the
enemy
in
full
retreat
and
laughed
gleefully
what
is
funny
queried
araminta
she
had
been
greatly
distressed
by
the
recitative
in
the
back
bedroom
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
with
fever
i
was
just
laughing
said
doctor
ralph
because
your
aunt
has
gone
home
and
is
never
coming
back
here
any
more
oh
doctor
ralph
is
she
there
was
alarm
in
araminta
voice
but
her
grey
eyes
were
shining
never
any
more
he
assured
her
in
a
satisfied
tone
how
long
have
you
lived
with
aunt
hitty
ever
since
i
was
a
baby
h
m
and
how
old
are
you
now
almost
nineteen
where
did
you
go
to
school
i
did
go
to
school
aunt
hitty
taught
me
at
home
did
you
ever
have
anybody
to
play
with
only
aunt
hitty
we
used
to
play
a
quilt
game
i
sewed
the
little
blocks
together
and
she
made
the
big
ones
must
have
been
highly
exciting
did
you
ever
have
a
doll
oh
no
araminta
eyes
were
wide
and
reproachful
now
the
bible
says
shalt
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image
doctor
ralph
sighed
deeply
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
paced
restlessly
across
araminta
bare
chamber
as
though
in
a
magic
mirror
he
saw
her
nineteen
years
of
deprivation
her
cramped
and
narrow
childhood
her
dense
ignorance
of
life
no
playmates
no
dolls
nothing
but
aunt
hitty
she
had
kept
araminta
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
mentally
shut
her
out
from
the
world
and
persistently
shaped
her
toward
a
monastic
ideal
a
child
brought
up
in
a
convent
could
have
been
no
more
of
a
nun
in
mind
and
spirit
than
araminta
ralph
well
knew
that
the
stern
guardianship
had
not
been
relaxed
a
moment
either
by
night
or
by
day
miss
mehitable
had
a
reputation
for
thoroughness
in
whatever
she
undertook
and
araminta
was
made
for
love
ralph
turned
to
look
at
her
as
she
lay
on
her
pillow
her
brown
wavy
hair
rioting
about
her
flushed
face
araminta
great
grey
eyes
were
very
grave
and
sweet
her
mouth
was
that
of
a
lovable
child
her
little
hands
were
dimpled
at
the
knuckles
in
fact
as
ralph
now
noted
there
were
many
dimples
appertaining
to
araminta
one
of
them
hovered
for
an
instant
about
the
corner
of
her
mouth
why
must
you
walk
she
asked
is
it
because
you
glad
your
ankle
broken
doctor
ralph
came
back
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
her
he
had
that
rare
sympathy
which
is
the
inestimable
gift
of
the
physician
and
long
years
of
practice
had
not
yet
calloused
him
so
that
a
suffering
was
merely
a
case
his
heart
was
dangerously
tender
toward
her
lots
of
things
are
worse
than
broken
ankles
he
assured
her
has
it
been
so
bad
to
be
shut
up
here
away
from
aunt
hitty
no
said
the
truthful
araminta
i
have
always
been
with
aunt
hitty
and
it
seems
queer
but
very
nice
someway
i
feel
as
if
i
had
grown
up
has
miss
evelina
been
good
to
you
oh
so
good
returned
araminta
gratefully
why
because
said
ralph
concisely
if
she
had
been
i
break
her
neck
you
could
whispered
araminta
softly
you
too
kind
you
would
hurt
anybody
not
unless
i
had
to
sometimes
there
has
to
be
a
little
hurt
to
keep
away
a
greater
one
you
hurt
me
i
think
but
i
did
know
just
when
it
was
the
smelly
sweet
stuff
was
it
ralph
did
not
heed
the
question
he
was
wondering
what
would
become
of
araminta
when
she
went
back
to
miss
mehitable
as
she
soon
must
her
ankle
was
healing
nicely
and
in
a
very
short
time
she
would
be
able
to
walk
again
he
could
not
keep
her
there
much
longer
by
a
whimsical
twist
of
his
thought
he
perceived
that
he
was
endeavouring
to
wrap
araminta
in
cotton
wool
of
a
different
sort
to
prevent
aunt
hitty
from
wrapping
her
in
her
own
particular
brand
the
little
cat
said
araminta
fondly
i
thought
perhaps
it
would
come
is
it
coming
when
i
am
well
holy
moses
ejaculated
ralph
he
had
never
thought
of
the
kitten
again
and
the
poor
child
had
been
waiting
patiently
with
never
a
word
the
clear
grey
eyes
were
upon
him
eloquent
with
belief
the
little
cat
replied
ralph
shamelessly
perjuring
himself
was
not
old
enough
to
leave
its
mother
we
have
to
wait
until
or
next
day
i
was
keeping
it
for
a
surprise
that
why
i
did
say
anything
about
it
i
thought
you
forgotten
oh
no
when
i
go
back
home
you
know
i
ca
have
it
aunt
hitty
would
never
let
me
wo
she
queried
ralph
we
see
he
spoke
with
confidence
he
was
far
from
feeling
and
was
dimly
aware
that
araminta
had
the
faith
he
lacked
she
thinks
i
a
he
said
to
himself
grimly
and
i
got
to
live
up
to
it
it
was
not
necessary
to
count
araminta
pulse
again
but
doctor
ralph
took
her
hand
a
childish
dimpled
hand
that
nestled
confidingly
in
his
listen
child
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
you
your
aunt
hitty
has
done
right
by
you
she
kept
you
in
cotton
when
you
ought
to
be
outdoors
you
should
have
gone
to
school
and
had
other
children
to
play
with
and
cats
cats
dogs
birds
rabbits
snakes
mice
pigeons
everything
i
was
never
in
cotton
corrected
araminta
except
once
when
i
had
a
bad
cold
that
is
just
what
i
mean
but
i
afraid
i
ca
make
you
understand
there
a
whole
world
full
of
big
beautiful
things
that
you
do
know
anything
about
great
sorrows
great
joys
and
great
loves
look
here
did
you
ever
feel
badly
about
anything
only
only
stammered
araminta
my
mother
you
know
she
was
was
married
poor
child
said
ralph
beginning
to
comprehend
have
you
been
taught
that
it
wrong
to
be
married
why
yes
answered
araminta
confidently
it
dreadful
aunt
hitty
is
married
neither
is
the
minister
it
very
very
wrong
aunt
hitty
told
my
mother
so
but
she
would
do
it
there
was
a
long
pause
the
little
warm
hand
still
rested
trustingly
in
ralph
listen
dear
he
began
clearing
his
throat
it
wrong
to
be
married
i
never
before
in
all
my
life
heard
of
anybody
who
thought
it
was
something
is
twisted
in
aunt
hitty
mind
or
else
she
taught
you
that
because
she
so
brutally
selfish
that
she
does
want
you
ever
to
be
married
some
people
who
are
unhappy
themselves
are
so
constituted
that
they
ca
bear
to
see
anybody
else
happy
she
afraid
of
life
and
she
taught
you
to
be
it
better
to
be
unhappy
araminta
than
never
to
take
any
risks
it
all
lies
in
yourself
at
last
if
you
a
true
loving
woman
and
never
let
yourself
be
afraid
nothing
very
bad
can
ever
happen
to
you
aunt
hitty
has
been
unjust
to
deny
you
life
you
have
the
right
to
love
and
learn
and
suffer
to
make
great
sacrifices
see
great
sacrifices
made
for
you
to
believe
to
trust
even
to
be
betrayed
it
your
right
and
it
been
kept
away
from
you
araminta
was
very
still
and
her
hand
was
cold
she
moved
it
uneasily
do
dear
said
ralph
his
voice
breaking
do
you
like
to
have
me
hold
your
hand
i
wo
if
you
do
want
me
to
araminta
drew
her
hand
away
she
was
frightened
i
do
wonder
you
afraid
continued
ralph
huskily
you
little
wild
bird
you
been
in
a
cage
all
your
life
i
going
to
open
the
door
and
set
you
free
miss
evelina
tapped
gently
on
the
door
then
entered
with
a
bowl
of
broth
for
the
invalid
she
set
it
down
on
the
table
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
went
out
as
quietly
as
she
had
come
i
going
to
feed
you
now
laughed
ralph
with
a
swift
change
of
mood
and
when
i
come
to
see
you
i
going
to
bring
you
a
book
what
kind
of
a
hook
asked
araminta
between
spoonfuls
a
novel
a
really
truly
novel
you
must
she
cried
frightened
again
you
get
burned
if
you
read
novels
some
of
them
are
pretty
hot
stuff
i
admit
returned
ralph
missing
her
meaning
but
of
course
i
would
give
you
that
kind
what
sort
of
stories
do
you
like
best
daniel
in
the
lions
den
and
about
the
ark
i
read
all
the
bible
twice
to
aunt
hitty
while
she
sewed
and
most
of
the
too
do
ask
me
to
read
a
novel
for
i
ca
it
would
be
wicked
all
right
we
wo
call
it
a
novel
it
be
just
a
story
book
it
is
wrong
to
read
stories
is
it
said
araminta
doubtfully
aunt
hitty
never
said
it
was
i
would
have
you
do
anything
wrong
araminta
you
know
that
now
until
beset
by
strange
emotions
doctor
ralph
dexter
went
home
finding
that
the
carriage
was
not
in
use
he
set
forth
alone
upon
his
feline
quest
reflecting
that
araminta
herself
was
not
much
more
than
a
little
grey
kitten
everywhere
he
went
he
was
regarded
with
suspicion
people
denied
the
possession
of
cats
even
while
cats
were
mewing
in
defiance
of
the
assertion
bribes
were
offered
and
sternly
refused
at
last
ten
miles
from
home
he
found
a
maltese
kitten
its
owner
was
willing
to
part
with
in
consideration
of
three
dollars
and
a
solemn
promise
that
the
cat
was
not
to
be
hurt
it
for
a
little
girl
who
is
ill
he
said
i
promised
her
a
kitten
so
your
father
often
said
responded
the
woman
but
someway
i
believe
you
on
the
way
home
he
pondered
long
before
the
hideous
import
of
it
came
to
him
all
at
once
he
knew
xiii
the
river
comes
into
its
own
father
asked
ralph
who
is
evelina
grey
anthony
dexter
started
from
his
chair
as
though
he
had
heard
a
pistol
shot
then
settled
back
forcing
his
features
into
calmness
he
waited
a
moment
before
speaking
i
do
know
he
answered
trying
to
make
his
voice
even
why
she
lives
in
the
house
with
my
one
patient
explained
ralph
up
on
the
hill
you
know
she
a
frail
ghostly
little
woman
in
black
and
she
always
wears
a
thick
white
veil
that
her
privilege
is
it
queried
anthony
dexter
he
had
gained
control
of
himself
now
and
spoke
almost
as
usual
of
course
i
did
ask
any
questions
continued
ralph
thoughtfully
but
obviously
the
only
reason
for
her
wearing
it
is
some
terrible
disfigurement
so
much
is
surgically
possible
in
these
days
that
i
thought
something
might
be
done
for
her
has
she
never
consulted
you
about
it
father
the
man
laughed
a
hollow
mirthless
laugh
no
he
said
she
has
then
he
laughed
once
more
in
a
way
that
jarred
upon
his
son
ralph
paced
back
and
forth
across
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
father
he
began
at
length
it
may
be
because
i
young
but
i
hold
before
me
very
strongly
the
ideals
of
our
profession
it
seems
a
very
beautiful
and
wonderful
life
that
is
opening
before
me
always
to
help
to
give
to
heal
i
i
feel
as
though
i
had
been
dedicated
to
some
sacred
calling
some
lifelong
service
and
service
means
brotherhood
you
get
over
that
returned
anthony
dexter
shortly
yet
not
without
a
certain
secret
admiration
when
you
had
to
engage
a
lawyer
to
collect
your
modest
wages
for
your
uplifting
work
the
healed
not
being
sufficiently
grateful
to
pay
the
healer
and
when
you
gone
ten
miles
in
the
dead
of
winter
at
midnight
to
take
a
pin
out
of
a
squalling
infant
back
why
you
may
change
your
mind
if
the
healed
are
grateful
observed
ralph
thoughtfully
it
must
be
in
some
way
my
fault
or
else
they
have
fully
understood
and
i
go
ten
miles
to
take
a
pin
out
of
a
baby
back
yes
i
sure
i
would
anthony
dexter
face
softened
almost
imperceptibly
it
youth
he
said
and
youth
is
a
fault
we
all
get
over
soon
enough
heaven
knows
when
you
forty
you
see
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
matter
of
business
and
that
in
the
last
analysis
we
working
against
laws
we
endeavour
to
prolong
the
lives
of
the
unfit
when
only
the
fittest
should
survive
that
makes
me
think
of
something
else
continued
ralph
in
a
low
tone
yesterday
i
canvassed
the
township
to
get
a
cat
for
araminta
the
poor
child
never
had
a
kitten
nobody
would
let
me
have
one
till
i
got
far
away
from
home
and
even
then
it
was
difficult
they
thought
i
wanted
it
for
for
the
laboratory
he
concluded
almost
in
a
whisper
yes
returned
doctor
dexter
with
a
rising
inflection
i
could
have
told
you
that
the
cat
and
dog
supply
was
somewhat
depleted
hereabouts
through
my
own
experiments
father
cried
ralph
his
face
eloquent
with
reproach
laughing
yet
secretly
ashamed
anthony
dexter
began
to
speak
surely
ralph
he
said
you
not
so
womanish
as
that
if
known
they
taught
such
stuff
as
that
at
my
old
alma
mater
i
have
sent
you
somewhere
else
who
doing
it
what
old
maid
have
they
added
to
their
faculty
oh
i
know
father
interrupted
ralph
waiving
discussion
heard
all
the
arguments
but
unfortunately
i
have
a
heart
i
know
by
what
right
we
assume
that
human
life
is
more
precious
than
animal
life
by
what
right
we
torture
and
murder
the
fit
in
order
to
prolong
the
lives
of
the
unfit
even
if
direct
evidence
were
obtainable
in
every
case
which
it
is
anyhow
i
ca
do
it
i
never
have
done
it
and
i
never
will
i
recognise
your
individual
right
to
shape
your
life
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
your
own
conscience
but
because
i
your
son
i
ca
help
being
ashamed
a
man
capable
of
torturing
an
animal
no
matter
for
what
purpose
is
also
capable
of
torturing
a
fellow
human
being
for
purposes
of
his
own
anthony
dexter
face
suddenly
blanched
with
anger
then
grew
livid
you
he
began
hotly
do
father
interrupted
ralph
we
not
have
any
words
not
let
a
difference
of
opinion
on
any
subject
keep
us
from
being
friends
perhaps
it
because
i
young
as
you
say
but
all
the
time
i
was
at
college
i
felt
that
i
had
something
to
lean
on
some
standard
to
shape
myself
to
mother
died
so
soon
after
i
was
born
that
it
is
almost
as
if
i
had
not
had
a
mother
i
have
even
a
childish
memory
of
her
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
you
meant
more
to
me
than
the
other
fellows
fathers
did
to
them
when
i
was
tempted
to
any
wrongdoing
the
thought
of
you
always
held
me
back
would
do
it
i
said
to
myself
always
does
the
square
thing
and
i
his
son
i
remembered
that
our
name
means
so
i
never
did
it
and
i
suppose
now
commented
anthony
dexter
with
assumed
sarcasm
your
idol
has
fallen
not
fallen
father
do
say
that
you
have
the
same
right
to
your
opinions
that
i
have
but
it
is
square
to
cut
up
an
animal
alive
just
because
you
the
stronger
and
there
no
law
to
prevent
you
you
know
it
is
square
in
the
accusing
silence
ralph
left
the
room
and
was
shortly
on
his
way
uphill
with
araminta
promised
cat
mewing
in
his
coat
pocket
the
grim
sardonic
humour
of
the
situation
appealed
strongly
to
doctor
dexter
to
think
he
said
to
himself
that
only
last
night
that
identical
cat
was
observed
as
a
fresh
and
promising
specimen
providentially
sent
to
me
in
the
hour
of
need
and
if
i
had
wanted
ralph
to
help
me
araminta
pet
would
at
this
moment
have
been
on
the
laboratory
table
having
its
heart
studied
in
action
repeatedly
he
strove
to
find
justification
for
a
pursuit
which
his
human
instinct
told
him
had
no
justification
his
reason
was
fully
adequate
but
something
else
failed
at
the
crucial
point
he
felt
definitely
uncomfortable
and
wished
that
ralph
might
have
avoided
the
subject
it
was
none
of
his
business
anyway
but
then
ralph
himself
had
admitted
that
his
experiments
were
nearly
completed
along
the
line
in
which
he
had
been
working
in
deference
to
a
local
sentiment
which
he
felt
to
be
extremely
narrow
and
dwarfing
he
had
done
his
work
secretly
he
had
kept
the
door
of
the
laboratory
locked
and
the
key
in
his
pocket
all
the
doors
and
windows
had
been
closely
barred
when
his
subjects
had
given
out
under
the
heavy
physical
strain
he
had
buried
the
pitiful
little
bodies
himself
he
had
counted
rather
too
surely
on
the
deafness
of
his
old
housekeeper
and
had
also
heavily
discounted
her
personal
interest
in
his
pursuits
and
her
tendency
to
gossip
yet
through
this
single
channel
had
been
disseminated
information
and
conjecture
which
made
it
difficult
for
ralph
to
buy
a
pet
for
araminta
anthony
dexter
shuddered
at
his
narrow
escape
suppose
araminta
cat
had
been
sacrificed
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
tell
ralph
one
more
experiment
was
absolutely
necessary
he
was
nearly
satisfied
but
not
quite
it
would
be
awkward
to
have
ralph
make
any
unpleasant
discoveries
and
he
could
not
very
well
keep
him
out
of
the
laboratory
now
without
arousing
his
suspicion
very
possibly
a
man
who
would
torture
an
animal
would
also
torture
a
human
being
but
he
was
unwilling
to
hurt
ralph
consequently
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
logic
the
boy
reasoning
was
faulty
unless
this
might
be
the
exception
which
proved
the
rule
who
was
evelina
grey
he
wondered
how
ralph
had
come
to
ask
the
question
suppose
he
had
told
him
that
evelina
grey
was
the
name
of
a
woman
who
haunted
him
night
and
day
in
her
black
gown
and
with
her
burned
face
heavily
veiled
she
was
seldom
out
of
his
mental
sight
all
through
the
past
years
he
had
continually
told
himself
that
he
had
forgotten
when
the
accusing
thought
presented
itself
he
had
invariably
pushed
it
aside
and
compelled
it
to
give
way
to
another
in
this
way
he
had
acquired
an
emotional
control
for
which
he
personally
had
great
admiration
not
observing
that
his
admiration
of
himself
was
an
emotion
and
at
that
less
creditable
than
some
others
might
have
been
man
walls
up
a
river
and
commands
it
to
do
his
bidding
outwardly
the
river
assents
to
the
arrangement
yielding
to
it
with
a
readiness
which
in
itself
is
suspicious
but
man
rapt
in
contemplation
of
his
own
skill
sees
little
else
by
night
and
by
day
the
river
leans
heavily
against
the
dam
tiny
sharp
currents
like
fingers
tear
constantly
at
the
structure
working
always
underneath
hidden
and
eddies
burrow
beneath
the
dam
little
river
animals
undermine
it
ever
so
slightly
with
tooth
and
claw
at
last
an
imperceptible
opening
is
made
streams
rush
down
from
the
mountain
to
join
the
river
even
raindrops
lend
their
individually
insignificant
aid
all
the
forces
of
nature
are
subtly
arrayed
against
the
obstruction
in
the
river
channel
suddenly
with
the
thunder
of
waters
at
last
unleashed
the
dam
breaks
and
the
structures
placed
in
the
path
by
complacent
and
man
are
swept
on
to
the
sea
like
so
much
the
river
at
last
has
come
into
its
own
a
feeling
long
controlled
must
eventually
break
its
bonds
forbidden
expression
and
not
spent
by
expression
it
accumulates
force
when
the
dam
breaks
the
flood
is
more
destructive
than
the
steady
normal
current
ever
could
have
been
having
denied
himself
remorse
and
having
refused
to
meet
the
fact
of
his
own
cowardice
anthony
dexter
was
now
face
to
face
with
the
inevitable
catastrophe
he
told
himself
that
ralph
coming
had
begun
it
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
it
was
that
veiled
and
ghostly
figure
standing
at
twilight
in
the
wrecked
garden
he
had
seen
it
again
on
the
road
where
hallucination
was
less
likely
if
not
altogether
impossible
then
the
cold
and
sinuous
necklace
of
discoloured
pearls
had
been
laid
at
his
door
the
pearls
which
had
come
first
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
then
from
the
depths
of
his
love
his
love
had
given
up
its
dead
as
the
sea
does
maimed
past
all
recognition
the
barrier
had
been
so
undermined
that
on
the
night
of
ralph
return
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
telling
thorpe
everything
indeed
nothing
but
ralph
swift
entrance
had
stopped
his
impassioned
speech
was
he
so
weak
that
only
a
slight
accident
had
kept
him
from
utter
after
years
of
magnificent
control
anthony
dexter
liked
that
word
magnificent
as
it
came
into
his
thoughts
in
connection
with
himself
father
would
do
it
father
always
does
the
square
thing
and
his
son
ralph
words
returned
with
a
pang
unbearably
keen
had
father
always
done
the
square
thing
or
had
father
been
a
coward
a
despicable
shirk
and
what
if
ralph
should
some
day
come
to
know
the
man
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
boy
face
if
he
knew
those
clear
honest
eyes
would
pierce
him
through
and
through
because
father
always
does
the
square
thing
remorsely
the
need
of
confession
surged
upon
him
there
was
no
confessional
in
his
church
he
even
had
no
church
yet
thorpe
was
his
friend
what
would
thorpe
tell
him
to
do
then
anthony
dexter
laughed
for
thorpe
had
unconsciously
told
him
what
to
do
and
he
was
spared
the
confession
as
though
written
in
letters
of
fire
the
words
came
back
honour
of
the
spoken
word
still
holds
him
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
she
consented
he
was
never
released
from
his
promise
did
not
even
ask
for
it
he
slunk
away
like
a
cur
in
the
sight
of
god
he
is
hound
to
her
by
his
own
word
still
he
should
go
to
her
and
either
fulfil
his
promise
or
ask
for
release
the
tardy
fulfilment
of
his
promise
would
be
the
only
atonement
he
could
had
evelina
come
back
to
demand
atonement
was
this
why
the
vision
of
her
confronted
him
everywhere
she
waited
for
him
on
the
road
in
daylight
mocked
him
from
the
shadows
darted
to
meet
him
from
every
tree
she
followed
him
on
the
long
and
lonely
ways
he
took
to
escape
her
and
as
he
walked
her
step
chimed
in
with
his
in
darkness
anthony
dexter
feared
to
turn
suddenly
lest
he
see
that
black
veiled
figure
at
his
heels
she
stood
aside
on
the
stairs
to
let
him
pass
her
entered
the
carriage
with
him
and
sat
opposite
her
veiled
face
averted
she
stood
with
him
beside
the
listened
with
him
to
the
when
he
used
the
stethoscope
waited
while
he
counted
the
pulse
and
measured
the
respiration
always
disapprovingly
she
stood
in
the
background
of
his
consciousness
when
he
wrote
a
prescription
his
pencil
seemed
to
catch
on
the
white
chiffon
which
veiled
the
paper
he
was
using
at
night
she
stood
beside
his
bed
waiting
in
his
sleep
most
often
secured
in
these
days
by
drugs
she
steadfastly
and
unfailingly
came
she
spoke
no
word
she
simply
followed
him
veiled
and
the
phantom
presence
was
driving
him
mad
he
admitted
it
now
and
father
always
does
the
square
thing
very
well
what
was
the
square
thing
if
father
always
does
it
he
will
do
it
now
what
is
it
anthony
dexter
did
not
know
that
he
asked
the
question
aloud
from
the
silence
vibrated
the
answer
in
thorpe
low
resonant
tones
honour
of
the
spoken
word
still
holds
him
he
was
never
released
he
slunk
away
like
a
cur
in
the
sight
of
god
he
is
bound
to
her
by
his
own
word
bound
to
her
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
he
felt
the
bitter
truth
he
was
bound
to
her
had
been
bound
for
years
was
bound
now
and
father
always
does
the
square
thing
once
in
a
man
life
perhaps
he
sees
himself
as
he
is
in
a
blinding
flash
of
insight
he
saw
what
he
must
do
confession
must
be
made
but
not
to
any
pallid
priest
in
a
confessional
not
to
thorpe
nor
to
ralph
but
to
evelina
herself
should
go
to
her
and
either
fulfil
his
promise
or
ask
for
release
the
tardy
fulfilment
of
his
promise
would
be
the
only
atonement
he
could
then
again
still
in
thorpe
voice
the
woman
is
here
and
you
can
find
your
friend
we
may
help
him
to
wash
the
stain
of
cowardice
off
his
the
stain
is
deep
muttered
anthony
dexter
god
knows
it
is
deep
once
again
came
thorpe
voice
shrilling
at
him
now
out
of
the
vibrant
silence
i
think
there
is
no
sin
but
shirking
i
can
excuse
a
liar
i
can
pardon
a
thief
i
can
pity
a
murderer
but
a
shirk
father
always
does
the
square
thing
evidently
ralph
would
like
to
have
his
father
bring
him
a
stepmother
a
woman
whose
face
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
and
place
her
at
the
head
of
his
table
veiled
or
not
as
ralph
chose
terribly
burned
hopelessly
disfigured
she
must
live
with
them
always
because
she
had
saved
him
from
the
same
thing
if
she
had
not
actually
saved
his
life
the
walls
of
the
room
swayed
the
furniture
moved
dizzily
the
floor
undulated
anthony
dexter
reeled
and
fell
in
a
dead
faint
are
you
all
right
now
father
it
was
ralph
voice
anxious
yet
cheery
who
have
thought
i
get
another
patient
so
soon
doctor
dexter
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
memory
returned
slowly
strength
more
slowly
still
ca
have
my
father
fainting
all
over
the
place
without
a
permit
resumed
ralph
you
been
doing
too
much
i
take
the
night
work
from
this
time
on
the
day
wore
into
late
afternoon
doctor
dexter
lay
on
the
couch
in
the
library
the
phantom
evelina
persistently
at
his
side
his
body
had
failed
but
his
mind
still
fought
feebly
there
is
no
one
here
he
said
aloud
i
am
all
alone
i
can
see
nothing
because
there
is
nothing
here
was
it
fancy
or
did
the
veiled
woman
convey
the
impression
that
her
burned
lips
distorted
themselves
yet
further
by
a
smile
at
dusk
there
was
a
call
ralph
received
from
his
father
a
full
history
of
the
case
with
suggestions
for
treatment
in
either
of
two
changes
that
might
possibly
have
taken
place
and
drove
away
the
loneliness
was
keen
the
empty
house
shorne
of
ralph
sunny
presence
was
unbearable
a
thousand
memories
surged
to
meet
him
a
thousand
voices
leaped
from
the
stillness
always
the
veiled
figure
stood
by
him
mutely
accusing
him
of
shameful
cowardice
above
and
beyond
all
was
thorpe
voice
shrilling
at
him
honour
of
the
spoken
word
still
holds
him
he
was
never
released
he
slunk
away
like
a
cur
he
is
bound
to
her
still
there
is
no
sin
but
over
and
over
again
the
words
rang
through
his
consciousness
then
like
an
afterclap
of
thunder
always
does
the
square
the
dam
crashed
the
barrier
of
years
was
broken
the
obstructions
were
swept
out
to
sea
remorse
and
shame
no
longer
denied
overwhelmingly
submerged
his
soul
he
struggled
up
from
the
couch
blindly
and
went
out
broken
in
body
crushed
in
spirit
yet
triumphantly
a
man
at
last
xiv
a
little
hour
of
triumph
miss
evelina
sat
alone
in
her
parlour
which
was
now
spotlessly
clean
araminta
had
had
her
supper
her
bath
and
her
clean
linen
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
until
morning
the
hard
work
had
proved
a
blessing
to
miss
evelina
her
thoughts
had
been
constantly
forced
away
from
herself
she
had
even
learned
to
love
araminta
with
the
protecting
love
which
grows
out
of
dependence
and
at
the
same
time
she
felt
herself
stronger
better
fitted
as
it
were
to
cope
with
her
own
grief
since
coming
back
to
her
old
home
her
thought
and
feeling
had
been
endlessly
and
painfully
confused
she
sat
in
her
low
rocker
with
her
veil
thrown
back
and
endeavoured
to
analyse
herself
and
her
surroundings
to
see
if
she
might
whither
she
was
being
led
she
was
most
assuredly
being
led
for
she
had
not
come
willingly
nor
remained
willingly
she
had
been
hurt
here
as
she
had
not
been
hurt
since
the
very
first
and
yet
if
a
dead
heart
can
be
glad
of
anything
she
was
glad
she
had
come
upon
the
far
horizon
of
her
future
she
dimly
saw
change
she
had
that
particular
sort
of
peace
which
comes
from
the
knowledge
that
the
worst
is
over
that
nothing
remains
the
last
drop
of
humiliation
had
been
poured
from
her
cup
the
day
she
met
anthony
dexter
on
the
road
and
had
been
splashed
with
mud
from
his
wheels
as
he
drove
by
it
was
inconceivable
that
there
should
be
more
dusk
came
and
the
west
gleamed
faintly
the
afterglow
merged
into
the
first
night
and
at
venus
blazed
superbly
on
high
sending
out
rays
mystically
prismatic
as
from
some
enchanted
lamp
our
star
anthony
dexter
had
been
wont
to
call
it
as
they
watched
for
it
in
the
scented
dusk
for
him
perhaps
it
had
been
indeed
the
but
she
had
followed
it
with
breaking
heart
into
the
quicksands
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
it
miss
evelina
closed
the
blinds
and
lighted
a
candle
then
sat
down
again
to
think
there
was
a
dull
uncertain
rap
at
the
door
doctor
ralph
possibly
he
had
sometimes
come
in
the
evening
or
else
miss
hitty
with
some
delicacy
for
araminta
breakfast
drawing
down
her
veil
she
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
thinking
as
she
did
so
that
lives
were
often
wrecked
or
altered
by
the
opening
or
closing
of
a
door
anthony
dexter
brushed
past
her
and
strode
into
the
parlour
through
her
veil
she
would
scarcely
have
recognised
him
he
was
so
changed
upon
the
instant
there
was
a
transformation
in
herself
the
suffering
woman
was
strangely
pushed
aside
she
could
come
again
but
she
must
step
aside
now
in
her
place
arose
a
veiled
vengeance
emotionless
keen
watchful
furtively
searching
for
the
place
to
strike
evelina
began
the
man
without
preliminary
i
have
come
back
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
i
am
a
coward
a
shirk
miss
evelina
laughed
quietly
in
a
way
that
stung
him
yes
she
said
politely
i
knew
that
you
need
not
have
troubled
to
come
and
tell
me
he
winced
do
he
muttered
if
you
knew
how
i
have
suffered
i
have
suffered
myself
she
returned
coldly
wondering
at
her
own
composure
she
marvelled
that
she
could
speak
at
all
years
ago
he
continued
in
a
tone
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
and
you
consented
i
have
never
been
released
from
my
promise
i
did
not
even
ask
to
be
i
slunk
away
like
a
cur
the
honour
of
the
spoken
word
still
holds
me
the
tardy
fulfilment
of
my
promise
is
the
only
atonement
i
can
make
the
shone
on
his
hair
thinning
at
the
temples
touched
into
bold
relief
every
line
of
his
face
years
ago
said
evelina
in
a
voice
curiously
low
and
distinct
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
and
i
consented
you
have
never
been
released
from
your
promise
you
did
not
even
ask
to
be
the
silence
was
vibrant
literally
tense
with
emotion
out
of
it
leaped
with
passionate
pride
i
release
you
now
no
he
cried
i
have
come
to
fulfil
my
promise
to
atone
if
atonement
can
be
made
do
you
call
your
belated
charity
atonement
years
ago
i
saved
you
from
death
or
worse
one
of
us
had
to
be
burned
and
it
was
i
instead
of
you
i
chose
it
not
deliberately
but
instinctively
because
i
loved
you
when
you
came
to
the
hospital
after
three
days
i
was
ill
he
interrupted
the
gas
you
were
told
she
went
on
her
voice
dominating
his
that
i
had
been
so
badly
burned
that
i
would
be
disfigured
for
life
that
was
enough
for
you
you
never
asked
to
see
me
never
tried
in
any
way
to
help
me
never
sent
by
a
messenger
a
word
of
thanks
for
your
cowardly
life
never
even
waited
to
be
sure
it
was
not
a
mistake
you
simply
went
away
there
was
no
mistake
he
muttered
helplessly
i
made
sure
he
turned
his
eyes
away
from
her
miserably
through
his
mind
came
detached
fragments
of
speech
honour
of
the
spoken
word
still
holds
him
father
always
does
the
square
i
am
asking
you
said
anthony
dexter
to
be
my
wife
i
am
offering
you
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
i
made
so
long
ago
i
am
asking
you
to
marry
me
to
live
with
me
to
be
a
mother
to
my
son
yes
repeated
evelina
you
ask
me
to
marry
you
would
you
have
a
scarred
and
disfigured
wife
a
man
usually
chooses
a
beautiful
woman
or
one
he
thinks
beautiful
to
sit
at
the
head
of
his
table
manage
his
house
take
the
place
of
a
servant
when
it
is
necessary
accept
gladly
what
money
he
chooses
to
give
her
and
bear
and
rear
his
children
poor
thing
that
i
am
you
offer
me
this
in
return
i
offer
you
release
i
gave
you
your
life
once
i
give
you
freedom
now
take
your
last
look
at
the
woman
who
would
not
marry
you
to
save
you
from
hell
the
man
started
forward
his
face
ashen
for
she
had
raised
her
veil
and
was
standing
full
in
the
light
in
the
tense
silence
he
gazed
at
her
fascinated
every
emotion
that
possessed
him
was
written
plainly
on
his
face
for
her
to
read
the
night
of
realisation
she
was
saying
turned
my
hair
white
since
i
left
the
hospital
no
human
being
has
seen
my
face
till
now
i
think
you
understand
why
anthony
dexter
breathed
hard
his
body
trembled
he
was
suffering
as
the
helpless
animals
had
suffered
on
the
table
in
his
laboratory
evelina
was
merciless
but
at
last
when
he
thought
she
had
no
pity
she
lowered
her
veil
the
length
of
chiffon
fell
between
them
eternally
it
was
like
the
closing
of
a
door
i
understand
he
breathed
oh
i
understand
it
is
my
punishment
you
have
scored
at
last
good
a
sob
drowned
the
last
word
he
took
her
cold
hand
in
his
and
bending
over
it
touched
it
with
his
quivering
lips
yes
laughed
evelina
kiss
my
hand
if
you
choose
why
not
my
hand
was
not
burned
his
face
working
piteously
he
floundered
out
into
the
night
and
staggered
through
the
gate
as
he
had
come
alone
the
night
wind
came
through
the
open
door
dank
and
cold
she
closed
it
then
bolted
it
as
though
to
shut
out
anthony
dexter
for
ever
it
was
his
punishment
he
had
said
she
had
scored
at
last
if
he
had
suffered
as
he
told
her
he
had
the
sight
of
her
face
would
be
torture
yes
evelina
knew
that
she
had
scored
from
her
hand
she
wiped
away
tears
a
man
hot
terrible
tears
through
the
night
she
sat
there
and
sleepless
fearlessly
unveiled
the
chiffon
trailed
its
misty
length
unheeded
upon
the
floor
the
man
she
had
loved
was
as
surely
dead
to
her
as
though
he
had
never
been
anthony
dexter
was
dead
true
his
body
and
mind
still
lived
but
he
was
not
the
man
she
had
loved
the
face
that
had
looked
into
hers
was
not
the
face
of
anthony
dexter
it
had
been
cold
and
calm
and
cruel
until
he
came
to
her
house
his
eyes
were
and
stirred
by
emotion
he
was
little
less
than
hideous
her
suffering
had
been
an
obsession
there
had
been
no
reason
for
it
not
the
shadow
of
an
excuse
a
year
as
the
piper
said
would
have
been
long
enough
for
her
to
grieve
she
saw
her
long
sorrow
now
as
something
outside
of
herself
a
beast
whose
prey
she
had
been
when
anthony
dexter
had
proved
himself
a
coward
she
should
have
thanked
god
that
she
knew
him
before
it
was
too
late
and
because
she
was
weak
in
body
because
her
hurt
heart
still
clung
to
her
love
for
him
she
had
groped
in
the
darkness
for
more
than
half
of
her
life
and
now
he
had
come
back
the
blood
of
triumph
surged
hard
she
loved
him
no
longer
then
why
was
she
not
free
her
chains
yet
lay
heavily
upon
her
in
the
midst
of
victory
she
was
still
bound
the
night
waned
she
was
exhausted
by
stress
of
feeling
and
the
long
vigil
but
the
iron
icy
hand
that
had
clasped
her
so
long
did
not
for
a
moment
relax
its
hold
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
stars
were
paling
the
mysterious
east
had
trembled
soon
it
would
be
day
she
watched
the
dawn
as
though
it
were
for
the
first
time
and
she
was
privileged
to
stand
upon
some
lofty
peak
when
god
said
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
the
tapestry
of
morning
flamed
splendidly
across
the
night
reflecting
its
colour
back
upon
her
unveiled
face
from
far
away
in
the
distant
hills
whose
summits
only
as
yet
were
touched
with
dawn
came
faint
sweet
music
the
pipes
o
pan
she
guessed
that
the
piper
was
abroad
with
laddie
in
some
fantastic
spirit
of
and
smiled
her
little
hour
of
triumph
was
over
her
soul
was
once
more
back
in
its
prison
the
prison
house
was
larger
and
different
but
it
was
still
a
prison
for
an
instant
freedom
had
flashed
before
her
and
dazed
her
now
it
was
dark
again
why
breathed
evelina
dear
god
why
as
if
in
answer
the
music
came
back
from
the
hills
in
uncertain
silvery
echoes
oh
pipes
o
pan
cried
evelina
choking
back
a
sob
i
pray
you
find
me
i
pray
you
teach
me
joy
xv
the
state
of
araminta
soul
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
was
in
his
room
at
miss
mehitable
with
a
pencil
held
loosely
in
his
wrinkled
hand
on
the
table
before
him
was
a
pile
of
rough
copy
paper
and
at
the
top
of
the
first
sheet
was
written
in
capitals
the
one
word
hell
it
was
underlined
and
around
it
he
had
drawn
sundry
fantastic
flourishes
and
shadings
but
the
rest
of
the
sheet
was
blank
for
more
than
an
hour
the
old
man
had
sat
there
his
blue
eyes
wandering
about
the
room
a
committee
from
his
congregation
had
visited
him
and
requested
him
to
preach
a
sermon
on
the
future
abode
of
the
wicked
the
wicked
as
the
minister
gathered
from
the
frank
talk
of
the
committee
included
all
who
did
not
belong
to
their
own
sect
try
as
he
might
the
minister
could
find
in
his
heart
nothing
save
charity
anger
and
resentment
were
outside
of
his
nature
he
told
himself
that
he
knew
the
world
and
had
experienced
his
share
of
injustice
that
he
had
seen
sin
in
all
of
its
hideous
phases
yet
even
for
the
unrepentant
sinner
thorpe
had
only
kindness
of
one
sin
only
thorpe
failed
in
comprehension
as
he
had
said
to
anthony
dexter
he
could
excuse
a
liar
pardon
a
thief
and
pity
a
murderer
but
he
had
only
contempt
for
a
shirk
persistently
he
analysed
and
questioned
himself
but
got
no
further
to
him
all
sin
resolved
itself
at
last
into
injustice
and
he
did
not
believe
that
any
one
was
ever
intentionally
unjust
but
the
congregation
desired
to
hear
of
hell
as
if
thought
thorpe
whimsically
i
received
daily
reports
with
a
sigh
he
turned
to
his
blank
sheet
in
the
earlier
stages
of
our
belief
he
wrote
we
conceived
of
hell
as
literally
a
place
of
fire
and
brimstone
of
eternal
suffering
and
torture
in
the
light
which
has
come
to
us
later
we
perceive
that
hell
is
a
spiritual
state
and
realise
that
the
consciousness
of
a
sin
is
its
punishment
then
he
tore
the
sheet
into
bits
for
this
was
not
what
his
congregation
wanted
yet
it
was
his
sincere
belief
he
could
not
stultify
himself
to
please
his
audience
they
must
take
him
as
he
was
or
let
him
go
yet
the
thought
of
leaving
was
unpleasant
for
he
had
found
work
to
do
in
a
field
where
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
was
sorely
needed
his
parishioners
had
heard
much
of
punishment
but
very
little
of
mercy
and
love
they
were
tangled
in
doctrinal
meshes
distraught
by
quibbles
and
at
swords
points
with
each
other
he
felt
that
he
must
in
some
way
temporise
and
hold
his
place
until
he
had
led
his
flock
to
a
loftier
height
he
had
no
desire
to
force
his
opinions
upon
any
one
else
but
he
wished
to
make
clear
his
own
strong
simple
faith
and
spread
abroad
if
he
might
his
own
perfect
trust
a
commanding
rap
resounded
upon
his
door
come
he
called
and
miss
mehitable
entered
thorpe
was
not
subtle
but
he
felt
that
this
errand
was
of
deeper
import
than
usual
the
rustle
of
her
garments
was
portentous
and
there
was
a
set
look
about
her
mouth
which
boded
no
good
to
anybody
will
you
sit
down
he
asked
offering
her
his
own
chair
no
snapped
miss
mehitable
i
wo
what
i
got
to
say
i
can
say
standin
i
come
she
announced
solemnly
from
the
ladies
aid
society
yes
thorpe
tone
was
interrogative
but
he
was
evidently
not
particularly
interested
i
appointed
a
committee
of
one
she
resumed
to
say
that
the
ladies
aid
society
have
voted
unanimously
that
they
want
you
to
preach
on
hell
the
church
is
goin
to
rack
and
ruin
and
we
ai
goin
to
stand
it
no
longer
even
the
disreputable
characters
will
walk
right
in
and
stay
all
through
the
sermon
andy
rogers
and
the
rest
and
i
was
particularly
requested
to
ask
whether
you
wished
to
have
us
understand
that
you
approve
of
andy
rogers
and
his
goin
on
what
temporised
thorpe
does
andy
rogers
do
for
the
lands
sake
ejaculated
miss
mehitable
was
he
drunk
four
months
ago
and
was
he
caught
stealing
the
deacon
chickens
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
never
heard
of
that
i
believe
i
did
hear
returned
the
minister
in
polite
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
had
been
miss
mehitable
sole
conversational
topic
at
the
time
he
stole
the
chickens
because
he
was
hungry
and
he
got
drunk
because
he
did
know
any
better
i
talked
with
him
and
he
promised
me
that
he
would
neither
steal
nor
drink
any
more
moreover
he
earned
the
money
and
paid
full
price
for
the
chickens
have
you
heard
that
he
has
broken
his
promise
no
i
dunno
i
have
but
he
do
it
again
if
he
gets
the
chance
you
just
see
thorpe
drummed
idly
on
the
table
with
his
pencil
wishing
that
miss
mehitable
would
go
he
had
for
his
that
deep
and
abiding
love
which
enables
one
to
let
other
people
alone
he
was
a
humanitarian
in
a
broad
and
admirable
sense
i
was
told
said
miss
mehitable
to
get
a
definite
answer
thorpe
bowed
his
white
head
ever
so
slightly
you
may
tell
the
ladies
aid
society
for
me
that
next
sunday
morning
i
will
give
my
congregation
a
sermon
on
hell
i
thought
i
could
make
you
see
the
reason
in
it
remarked
miss
mehitable
piously
taking
credit
to
herself
and
now
that
settled
i
want
to
speak
of
araminta
she
getting
well
all
right
is
she
queried
thorpe
anxiously
he
had
a
tender
place
in
his
heart
for
the
child
that
what
i
do
know
not
bein
allowed
to
speak
to
her
or
touch
her
what
i
do
know
is
that
her
immortal
soul
is
in
peril
now
that
she
taken
away
from
my
influence
i
want
you
to
get
a
permit
from
that
that
curing
her
or
pretending
to
and
go
up
and
see
her
i
guess
her
pastor
has
a
right
to
see
her
even
if
her
poor
old
aunt
ai
i
want
you
to
find
out
when
she
be
able
to
be
moved
and
talk
to
her
about
her
soul
dwellin
particularly
on
hell
thorpe
bowed
again
i
will
be
very
glad
to
do
anything
i
can
for
araminta
shortly
afterward
he
made
an
errand
to
doctor
dexter
and
saw
ralph
who
readily
gave
him
permission
to
visit
his
entire
clientele
i
got
another
patient
laughed
the
boy
my
practice
is
increasing
at
the
rate
of
one
case
a
month
if
i
were
too
to
dump
a
batch
of
germs
into
the
water
supply
i
have
a
lot
more
how
is
araminta
asked
thorpe
passing
by
ralph
frivolity
she
all
right
he
answered
his
sunny
face
clouding
she
can
go
home
almost
any
time
now
i
hate
to
send
her
back
into
her
cage
bless
her
little
heart
it
was
late
afternoon
when
thorpe
started
up
the
hill
to
observe
and
report
upon
the
state
of
araminta
soul
he
had
struggled
vainly
with
his
own
problem
and
had
at
last
decided
to
read
a
fiery
sermon
by
one
of
the
early
evangelists
from
a
volume
which
he
happened
to
have
the
sermon
was
lurid
with
flame
and
he
thought
it
would
satisfy
his
congregation
he
would
preface
it
with
the
statement
that
it
was
not
his
but
he
hoped
they
would
regard
it
as
a
privilege
to
hear
the
views
of
a
man
who
was
without
doubt
wiser
and
better
than
he
miss
evelina
came
to
the
door
when
he
rapped
and
at
the
sight
of
her
veiled
face
a
flood
of
pity
overwhelmed
him
he
introduced
himself
and
asked
whether
he
might
see
araminta
when
he
was
ushered
into
the
invalid
room
he
found
her
propped
up
by
pillows
and
her
hair
was
rioting
in
waves
about
her
flushed
face
a
small
maltese
kitten
curled
into
a
fluffy
ball
slept
on
the
snowy
counterpane
beside
her
araminta
had
been
reading
the
story
book
which
doctor
ralph
had
brought
her
little
maid
asked
the
minister
how
is
the
ankle
it
well
and
i
to
walk
on
it
for
the
first
time
doctor
ralph
has
been
so
good
to
me
everybody
been
good
thorpe
picked
up
the
book
which
lay
face
downward
and
held
it
close
to
his
eyes
araminta
trembled
she
was
afraid
he
would
take
it
away
from
her
all
that
day
she
had
lived
in
a
new
land
where
men
were
brave
and
women
were
fair
castle
towers
loomed
darkly
purple
in
the
sunset
or
shone
whitely
at
noon
kings
and
queens
knights
and
ladies
moved
sedately
across
the
tapestry
mounted
on
white
chargers
with
trappings
of
scarlet
and
gold
long
lances
shimmered
in
the
sun
and
the
armour
of
the
knights
gave
back
the
light
an
hundred
fold
strange
music
sounded
in
araminta
ears
love
songs
and
serenades
hymns
of
battle
and
bugle
calls
she
felt
the
rush
of
conflict
knew
the
anguish
of
the
wounded
and
heard
the
exultant
strains
of
victory
and
all
of
it
araminta
had
greatly
marvelled
at
this
was
done
for
love
the
love
of
man
and
woman
a
knight
in
the
book
had
asked
the
lady
of
his
heart
to
marry
him
and
she
had
not
seen
that
she
was
insulted
nor
guessed
that
he
was
offering
her
disgrace
araminta
wondered
that
the
beautiful
lady
could
be
so
stupid
but
of
course
she
had
no
aunt
hitty
to
set
her
right
far
from
feeling
shame
the
lady
heart
had
sung
for
joy
but
secretly
since
she
was
proud
further
on
the
same
beautiful
lady
had
humbled
her
pride
for
the
sake
of
her
love
and
had
asked
the
gallant
knight
to
marry
her
since
she
had
once
refused
to
marry
him
why
araminta
exclaimed
thorpe
greatly
surprised
i
thought
miss
mehitable
did
not
allow
you
to
read
novels
a
novel
why
no
thorpe
it
is
a
novel
it
just
a
story
book
doctor
ralph
told
me
so
austin
thorpe
laughed
indulgently
a
rose
by
any
other
name
he
said
is
none
the
less
a
rose
doctor
ralph
was
right
it
is
a
story
book
and
i
am
right
too
for
it
is
also
a
novel
araminta
turned
very
pale
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
thorpe
she
said
in
an
anguished
whisper
will
i
be
burned
why
child
what
do
you
mean
i
did
know
it
was
a
novel
sobbed
araminta
i
thought
it
was
a
story
book
aunt
hitty
says
people
who
read
novels
get
burned
they
writhe
in
hell
forever
in
the
lake
of
fire
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
hall
no
one
was
in
sight
he
closed
the
door
very
gently
and
came
back
to
araminta
bed
he
drew
his
chair
nearer
and
leaned
over
her
speaking
in
a
low
voice
that
he
might
not
be
heard
araminta
my
poor
child
he
said
perhaps
i
am
a
heretic
i
know
but
i
do
not
believe
that
a
being
divine
enough
to
be
a
god
could
be
human
enough
to
cherish
so
fiendish
a
passion
as
revenge
look
up
dear
child
look
up
araminta
turned
toward
him
obediently
but
she
was
still
sobbing
it
is
a
world
of
mystery
he
went
on
we
do
not
know
why
we
come
nor
where
we
go
we
only
know
that
we
come
and
that
eventually
we
go
yet
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
of
us
nor
any
number
of
us
have
the
right
to
say
what
the
rest
of
us
shall
believe
i
can
not
think
of
heaven
as
a
place
sparsely
populated
by
my
own
sect
with
a
world
of
sinners
languishing
in
flames
below
i
think
of
heaven
as
a
sunny
field
where
clover
blooms
and
birds
sing
all
day
there
are
trees
with
long
cool
shadows
where
the
weary
may
rest
there
is
a
crystal
stream
where
they
may
forget
their
thirst
i
do
not
think
of
heaven
as
a
place
of
judgment
but
rather
of
pardon
and
love
punishment
there
is
undoubtedly
but
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
we
are
sufficiently
punished
here
for
all
we
do
that
is
wrong
we
intend
to
do
wrong
araminta
we
get
tired
and
things
and
people
worry
us
and
we
are
unjust
we
are
like
children
afraid
in
the
dark
we
live
in
a
world
of
doubting
we
are
made
the
slaves
of
our
own
fears
and
so
we
shirk
but
the
burning
said
araminta
wiping
her
eyes
is
nobody
ever
to
be
burned
the
god
i
worship
answered
thorpe
passionately
never
could
be
cruel
but
there
are
many
gods
it
seems
and
many
strange
beliefs
listen
araminta
whom
do
you
love
most
aunt
hitty
she
questioned
no
you
do
have
to
say
that
if
it
is
so
you
can
be
honest
with
me
who
of
all
the
world
is
nearest
to
you
whom
would
you
choose
to
be
with
you
always
if
you
could
have
only
one
doctor
ralph
cried
araminta
her
eyes
shining
i
thought
so
replied
thorpe
i
do
know
that
i
blame
you
now
suppose
doctor
ralph
did
things
that
hurt
you
that
there
was
continual
misunderstanding
and
distrust
suppose
he
wronged
you
cruelly
and
apparently
did
everything
he
could
to
distress
you
and
make
you
miserable
could
you
condemn
him
to
a
lake
of
fire
why
no
she
cried
i
know
he
never
meant
to
do
it
suppose
you
knew
he
meant
it
persisted
thorpe
looking
at
her
keenly
then
said
araminta
tenderly
i
feel
very
very
sorry
exactly
and
why
because
as
you
say
you
love
him
and
god
is
love
araminta
do
you
understand
upon
the
cramped
and
imprisoned
soul
of
the
child
the
light
slowly
dawned
god
is
love
she
repeated
and
nobody
would
burn
people
they
loved
there
was
an
illuminating
silence
then
thorpe
spoke
again
he
told
araminta
of
a
love
so
vast
and
deep
that
it
could
not
be
measured
by
finite
standards
of
infinite
pity
and
infinite
pardon
this
love
was
everywhere
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
place
where
it
was
not
it
enveloped
not
only
the
whole
world
but
all
the
shining
worlds
beyond
and
this
love
in
itself
and
of
itself
was
god
this
said
araminta
touching
the
book
timidly
is
it
bad
nothing
is
bad
explained
thorpe
carefully
which
does
not
harm
you
or
some
one
else
of
the
two
it
is
better
to
harm
yourself
than
another
how
does
the
book
make
you
feel
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
the
world
was
a
beautiful
place
and
as
if
i
ought
to
be
better
so
i
could
make
it
still
more
beautiful
by
living
in
it
then
araminta
it
is
a
good
book
thorpe
went
strangely
uplifted
to
him
truth
was
not
a
creed
but
a
light
which
illumined
all
creeds
his
soul
was
aflame
with
eagerness
to
help
and
comfort
the
whole
world
miss
evelina
was
waiting
in
the
hall
veiled
and
silent
as
always
she
opened
the
door
but
thorpe
lingered
striving
vainly
for
the
right
word
he
could
not
find
it
but
he
had
to
speak
miss
evelina
he
stammered
the
high
colour
mounting
to
his
temples
if
there
should
ever
be
anything
i
can
do
for
you
will
you
let
me
know
she
seemed
to
shrink
back
into
her
veil
yes
she
said
at
length
i
will
then
fearing
she
had
been
ungracious
she
added
thank
you
his
mood
of
exaltation
was
still
upon
him
and
he
wandered
long
in
the
woods
before
going
home
his
spirit
dwelt
in
the
high
places
and
from
the
height
he
gained
the
broad
view
when
he
entered
the
house
miss
mehitable
was
waiting
for
him
with
a
torrent
of
questions
when
he
had
an
opportunity
to
reply
he
reported
that
he
had
seen
doctor
ralph
and
araminta
could
come
home
almost
any
time
now
yes
he
had
talked
with
araminta
about
her
soul
and
she
had
cried
he
thought
he
had
done
her
good
by
going
and
was
greatly
indebted
to
miss
mehitable
for
the
suggestion
xvi
the
march
of
the
days
out
in
the
garden
the
piper
was
attending
to
his
belated
planting
he
had
cleared
the
entire
place
repaired
the
wall
and
made
in
fantastic
shapes
that
pleased
his
own
fancy
he
was
putting
in
the
seeds
while
laddie
played
about
his
feet
and
miss
evelina
stood
by
timidly
watchful
i
do
not
see
she
said
why
you
take
so
much
trouble
to
make
me
a
garden
nobody
was
ever
so
good
to
me
before
the
piper
laughed
and
paused
a
moment
to
wipe
his
ruddy
face
did
nobody
ever
care
before
whether
or
not
you
had
a
garden
never
returned
evelina
sadly
then
is
time
some
one
did
so
laddie
and
i
have
come
to
make
it
for
you
but
i
thinking
is
largely
for
ourselves
too
since
the
doing
is
the
best
part
of
anything
miss
evelina
made
no
answer
speech
did
not
come
easily
to
her
after
years
of
habitual
repression
will
be
a
brave
garden
continued
the
piper
cheerily
marigolds
and
larkspur
and
mignonette
phlox
and
lad
love
rosemary
lavender
and
verbena
and
many
another
that
you
not
guess
till
the
time
comes
for
blossoming
lad
love
grew
in
my
garden
once
sighed
evelina
after
a
little
it
was
sweet
while
it
lasted
oh
but
it
was
sweet
she
spoke
so
passionately
that
the
piper
gathered
the
underlying
significance
of
her
words
you
speaking
of
another
garden
i
think
he
ventured
the
garden
in
your
heart
is
meet
that
lad
love
should
grow
there
are
you
sure
was
not
a
weed
yes
it
was
a
weed
she
replied
bitterly
the
mistake
was
mine
the
piper
leaned
on
his
rake
thoughtfully
is
hard
i
think
he
said
for
us
to
see
that
the
mistakes
are
all
ours
the
gardener
plants
rightly
but
we
are
never
satisfied
when
sweet
herbs
are
meant
for
us
we
ask
for
roses
and
is
not
every
garden
in
which
a
rose
will
bloom
if
we
could
keep
it
clean
of
weeds
and
make
it
free
of
all
anger
and
distrust
there
be
heartsease
there
instead
of
thorns
heartsease
asked
evelina
piteously
i
thought
there
was
no
more
lady
said
the
piper
there
is
heartsease
for
the
asking
thinking
is
you
who
have
spoiled
your
garden
no
cried
evelina
believe
me
it
was
not
i
who
else
queried
the
piper
with
a
look
which
made
her
shrink
farther
back
into
the
shelter
of
her
chiffon
ah
i
was
not
asking
a
question
that
needed
an
answer
i
do
not
concern
myself
with
names
and
things
but
ask
this
of
yourself
is
there
sin
on
your
soul
no
she
whispered
unless
it
be
a
sin
to
suffer
for
years
another
sin
then
you
grieving
because
another
has
done
wrong
because
another
has
done
wrong
to
me
the
piper
came
to
her
and
laid
his
hand
very
gently
upon
hers
there
was
reassurance
in
the
friendly
human
touch
is
there
he
said
that
the
trouble
lies
is
not
for
you
to
suffer
because
you
are
wronged
but
for
the
one
who
has
wronged
you
he
must
have
been
very
dear
to
you
i
thinking
else
you
would
not
hide
the
beauty
of
your
face
beauty
repeated
evelina
scornfully
you
do
not
understand
i
was
burned
horribly
burned
yes
said
the
piper
softly
and
what
of
that
beauty
is
of
the
soul
he
went
out
to
the
gate
and
brought
in
a
small
flat
box
is
for
you
he
said
i
got
it
for
you
when
i
went
to
the
city
there
was
none
here
she
opened
the
box
her
fingers
trembling
and
held
up
length
after
length
of
misty
white
chiffon
i
ask
no
questions
said
the
piper
proudly
but
i
know
that
because
you
are
so
beautiful
you
hide
your
face
laddie
and
i
we
got
more
of
the
white
stuff
to
help
you
hide
it
because
you
would
not
let
us
see
how
beautiful
you
are
the
chiffon
fluttered
in
her
hand
though
there
was
no
wind
why
she
asked
in
a
strange
voice
why
did
you
do
this
you
gave
me
a
garden
laughed
the
piper
when
i
had
no
garden
of
my
own
so
why
should
i
not
get
the
white
stuff
for
you
was
queer
the
day
i
got
it
he
went
on
chuckling
at
the
recollection
for
i
did
not
know
its
name
every
place
i
went
i
asked
for
white
stuff
and
they
showed
me
many
kinds
but
nothing
like
this
at
last
i
said
to
a
young
girl
is
it
that
is
like
a
cloud
all
white
and
soft
which
one
can
see
through
but
through
which
no
one
can
be
seen
the
stuff
that
ladies
wear
when
they
are
so
beautiful
that
they
do
not
want
their
faces
seen
she
smiled
and
told
me
it
was
and
so
a
wave
of
the
hand
finished
his
explanation
after
an
interval
of
silence
the
piper
spoke
again
there
are
chains
that
bind
you
he
began
but
they
are
chains
of
your
own
forging
no
one
else
can
shackle
you
you
must
always
do
it
yourself
whatever
is
past
is
over
and
i
thinking
you
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
a
butterfly
has
with
the
empty
chrysalis
from
which
he
came
the
law
of
life
is
growth
and
we
can
not
linger
we
must
always
be
going
on
you
stand
alone
upon
a
height
he
said
dreamily
like
one
in
a
dreary
land
behind
you
all
is
darkness
before
you
all
is
darkness
there
is
but
one
small
space
of
light
in
that
one
space
is
a
day
they
come
one
at
a
time
from
the
night
of
and
vanish
into
the
night
of
yesterday
i
have
thought
of
the
days
as
men
and
women
for
a
woman
day
is
not
at
all
like
a
man
for
you
i
think
they
first
were
children
with
laughing
eyes
and
little
dimpled
hands
one
at
a
time
they
came
out
of
the
darkness
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
on
the
other
side
some
brought
you
flowers
or
new
toys
and
some
brought
you
childish
griefs
but
none
came
each
day
laid
its
gift
at
your
feet
and
went
on
some
brought
their
gifts
wrapped
up
that
you
might
have
the
surprise
of
opening
them
many
a
gift
in
a
covering
turned
out
to
be
far
from
what
you
expected
when
you
were
opening
it
some
of
the
happiest
gifts
were
hidden
in
dull
coverings
you
took
off
slowly
dreading
to
see
the
contents
some
days
brought
many
gifts
others
only
one
as
the
days
grew
older
some
brought
you
laughter
some
gave
you
light
and
love
others
came
with
music
and
pleasure
and
some
of
them
brought
pain
yes
sighed
evelina
some
brought
pain
it
is
of
that
went
on
the
piper
that
i
wished
to
be
speaking
it
was
one
day
was
it
not
that
brought
you
a
long
sorrow
yes
not
more
than
one
was
it
only
one
day
yes
only
one
day
see
said
the
piper
gently
the
day
came
with
her
gift
you
would
not
let
her
lay
it
at
your
feet
and
pass
on
into
the
darkness
of
yesterday
you
held
her
by
her
grey
garments
and
would
not
let
her
go
you
kept
searching
her
sad
eyes
to
see
whether
she
did
not
have
further
pain
for
you
why
keep
her
back
from
her
appointed
way
why
not
let
your
days
go
by
the
other
days
murmured
evelina
have
all
been
sad
yes
and
why
you
were
holding
fast
to
one
day
the
one
that
brought
you
pain
so
with
downcast
eyes
they
passed
you
and
carried
their
appointed
gifts
on
into
yesterday
where
you
can
never
find
them
again
even
now
the
one
day
you
have
been
holding
is
struggling
to
free
herself
from
the
chains
you
have
put
upon
her
you
have
no
right
to
keep
a
day
should
i
not
keep
the
gifts
she
asked
his
fancy
pleased
her
the
gifts
yes
even
the
gifts
of
tears
but
never
a
day
you
can
not
hold
a
happy
day
for
it
goes
too
quickly
this
one
sad
day
that
marched
so
slowly
by
you
is
the
one
you
chose
to
hold
lady
he
pleaded
let
her
go
the
other
days
she
whispered
brokenly
what
of
them
no
man
can
say
while
you
have
been
holding
this
one
the
others
have
passed
you
taking
your
gifts
into
yesterday
memory
guards
yesterday
but
there
is
a
veil
on
the
face
of
sometimes
i
think
is
so
beautiful
that
she
hides
her
face
god
veils
her
face
cried
evelina
or
else
we
could
not
live
lady
said
the
piper
have
you
lived
so
long
and
never
learned
this
simple
thing
whatever
a
day
may
bring
you
whatever
terrible
gifts
of
woe
if
you
search
her
closely
you
will
always
find
the
strength
to
meet
her
face
to
face
overshadowed
by
her
burden
of
bitterness
one
fails
to
find
the
balm
concealed
within
her
garments
or
held
loosely
in
her
hand
she
always
has
her
bit
of
consolation
rosemary
in
the
midst
of
her
rue
belief
with
the
doubt
life
with
the
death
i
found
no
balm
murmured
evelina
in
the
day
you
say
i
held
had
there
been
no
secret
balm
you
could
never
have
held
her
the
thorns
would
have
pierced
your
hands
have
you
not
seen
that
you
can
never
have
sorrow
until
you
have
first
had
joy
happiness
is
the
light
and
sadness
the
shade
god
sets
you
right
and
you
stray
from
the
path
into
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
the
cypress
casts
a
long
shadow
said
evelina
pointing
to
the
tree
at
the
gate
the
piper
smiled
the
shadow
of
a
sorrow
is
longer
than
the
sorrow
he
answered
the
shadow
of
one
day
with
you
has
stretched
over
years
is
approaching
night
that
makes
long
shadows
when
life
is
at
noon
they
are
short
when
life
is
at
its
highest
there
are
no
shadows
at
all
miss
evelina
sighed
and
leaned
uneasily
against
the
wall
this
i
thinking
mused
the
piper
is
the
inmost
truth
of
living
there
is
always
a
balance
which
swings
true
a
sorrow
is
precisely
equal
to
a
joy
and
the
shadow
can
loom
no
larger
unless
the
light
slants
and
if
you
sit
always
in
the
sun
the
shadow
that
lies
behind
a
joy
can
be
scarcely
seen
at
all
a
faint
breath
of
spring
stirred
miss
evelina
veil
she
caught
at
it
and
tied
the
long
floating
ends
about
her
neck
i
would
not
look
said
the
piper
softly
if
your
veil
should
blow
away
i
would
close
my
eyes
and
feel
my
way
to
the
gate
unless
you
chose
to
have
me
see
your
beauty
i
would
never
ask
nor
take
advantage
of
an
accidental
opportunity
i
thinking
you
are
very
beautiful
but
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
me
miss
evelina
did
not
reply
she
only
leaned
more
heavily
against
the
wall
lady
he
continued
perhaps
you
think
i
do
not
know
you
may
think
i
talking
blindly
but
there
are
few
sorrows
in
the
world
that
i
have
not
seen
face
to
face
those
i
have
not
had
myself
my
friends
have
had
and
i
have
been
privileged
to
share
with
them
the
sorrows
of
the
world
are
not
so
many
they
are
few
and
in
essence
the
same
it
very
strange
i
thinking
the
little
laughing
creeping
days
go
by
us
then
the
awkward
ones
that
bring
us
the
first
footsteps
then
childhood
comes
and
youth
and
then
maturity
but
the
days
have
begun
to
grow
feeble
before
one
learns
how
to
meet
them
how
to
take
the
gifts
humbly
scorning
none
and
how
to
make
each
day
give
up
its
secret
balm
memory
the
angel
who
stands
at
the
portal
of
yesterday
has
always
an
inscrutable
smile
she
keeps
for
us
so
many
things
that
we
would
be
glad
to
spare
and
pushes
headlong
into
yesterday
so
much
that
we
fain
would
keep
i
do
not
yet
know
all
the
ways
of
memory
i
only
know
that
she
means
to
be
kind
kind
repeated
evelina
her
tone
was
indescribably
bitter
yes
returned
the
piper
memory
means
to
be
kind
she
is
kind
i
have
said
that
i
do
not
know
her
ways
but
of
that
i
am
sure
lady
i
would
that
you
could
let
go
of
the
day
you
are
holding
back
cast
her
from
you
and
let
her
go
into
the
yesterday
from
which
you
have
kept
her
so
long
perhaps
memory
will
be
kinder
to
you
then
for
remember
she
stands
at
the
gate
i
can
not
breathed
evelina
i
have
tried
and
i
can
not
let
her
go
yes
said
the
piper
very
gently
you
can
is
that
thinking
that
has
set
your
life
all
wrong
unclasp
your
hands
from
her
rough
garments
cease
to
question
her
closed
eyes
take
her
gift
and
the
balm
that
infallibly
comes
with
it
meet
with
kindness
and
with
a
brave
heart
oh
spinner
in
the
shadow
he
cried
his
voice
breaking
i
fain
would
see
you
a
spinner
in
the
sun
no
she
sighed
i
have
been
in
the
dark
too
long
there
is
no
light
for
me
there
is
light
he
insisted
when
you
admit
the
shadow
you
have
at
the
same
time
acknowledged
the
light
evelina
shook
her
head
too
late
she
said
despairingly
it
is
too
late
ah
cried
the
piper
if
you
could
only
trust
me
i
have
helped
many
a
soul
into
the
sun
again
i
trusted
said
evelina
and
my
trust
was
betrayed
yes
he
answered
i
know
i
have
trusted
too
and
i
have
been
betrayed
also
but
i
know
that
the
one
who
wronged
me
must
suffer
more
than
i
she
laughed
a
wild
fantastic
laugh
the
one
who
wronged
me
she
said
has
not
suffered
at
all
he
married
in
a
year
there
are
different
ways
of
suffering
he
explained
with
a
woman
it
is
most
often
spread
out
over
a
long
period
the
quick
stroke
is
seldom
given
to
a
woman
she
suffers
less
and
longer
than
a
man
with
him
i
thinking
it
has
come
or
will
come
all
at
once
if
it
does
she
cried
her
frail
body
quivering
what
a
day
for
him
oh
what
a
day
her
voice
was
trembling
with
the
hideous
passion
for
revenge
and
the
piper
read
her
unerringly
lady
he
said
sadly
is
a
long
way
to
the
light
but
i
here
to
help
you
find
it
we
be
going
now
laddie
and
i
but
we
come
back
soon
he
whistled
to
the
dog
and
the
two
went
off
downhill
together
she
watched
him
from
the
gate
until
the
bobbing
red
feather
turned
a
corner
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
the
cheery
whistle
had
ceased
the
stillness
was
acute
profound
it
was
so
deep
that
it
seemed
positive
rather
than
negative
she
went
back
into
the
house
her
steps
dragging
painfully
as
in
a
vision
she
saw
the
days
passing
her
while
she
stood
upon
a
height
all
around
her
were
bare
rocks
and
fearful
precipices
there
was
nothing
but
a
narrow
path
in
front
day
by
day
they
came
peacefully
contentedly
till
at
last
dawned
that
terrible
one
which
had
blasted
her
life
was
it
true
that
she
still
held
that
day
by
the
garment
and
could
not
unclasp
her
hands
one
by
one
they
had
passed
her
leaving
no
gifts
because
she
still
clung
to
one
if
she
could
let
go
what
gifts
would
the
others
bring
joy
never
there
was
no
joy
in
the
world
for
her
sometime
that
mystical
procession
must
come
to
an
end
when
the
last
day
passed
on
she
would
follow
too
and
go
into
the
night
of
yesterday
where
perhaps
there
was
peace
as
never
before
she
craved
the
last
gift
praying
to
see
the
uplifted
head
and
stately
figure
of
the
last
day
grave
silent
unfathomable
tender
the
day
with
the
veiled
face
bearing
white
poppies
in
her
hands
xvii
loved
by
a
dog
anthony
dexter
sat
on
the
porch
in
front
of
his
house
alone
ralph
had
been
out
since
early
morning
attending
to
his
calls
it
was
the
last
of
april
and
the
trees
were
brave
in
their
panoply
of
new
leaves
birds
were
singing
and
the
very
air
was
eloquent
with
new
life
between
anthony
dexter
and
the
lilac
bush
at
the
gate
there
moved
perpetually
the
black
veiled
figure
of
evelina
grey
he
knew
she
was
not
there
and
he
was
fully
certain
of
the
fact
that
it
was
an
hallucination
but
his
assurance
had
not
done
away
with
the
phantom
how
mercilessly
she
followed
him
since
the
night
he
had
flung
himself
out
of
her
house
tortured
in
every
nerve
she
had
not
for
a
moment
left
him
when
he
walked
through
the
house
she
followed
him
her
stealthy
footfall
sounding
just
the
merest
fraction
of
a
second
after
his
he
avoided
the
bare
polished
floors
and
walked
on
the
rugs
whenever
possible
that
he
might
not
hear
that
soft
slow
step
so
plainly
ralph
had
laughed
at
him
once
for
taking
a
long
awkward
jump
from
rug
to
rug
within
the
line
of
his
vision
she
moved
horizontally
but
never
back
and
forth
sometimes
her
veiled
face
was
averted
and
sometimes
through
the
eternal
barrier
of
chiffon
he
could
feel
her
burning
eyes
fixed
pitilessly
upon
his
he
never
slept
now
without
drugs
gradually
he
had
increased
the
dose
but
to
no
purpose
evelina
haunted
his
sleep
endlessly
and
he
had
no
respite
through
the
dull
stupor
of
the
night
she
was
never
for
a
moment
absent
and
in
every
horrible
dream
she
stood
in
the
foreground
mute
solitary
accusing
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
clutches
of
a
drug
addiction
but
that
was
nothing
to
be
feared
in
comparison
with
his
veiled
phantom
he
had
exhausted
the
harmless
soporifics
long
ago
and
turned
perforce
to
the
swift
and
deadly
ministers
of
forgetfulness
the
veiled
figure
moved
slowly
back
and
forth
across
the
yard
lifting
its
skirts
daintily
to
avoid
a
tiny
pool
of
water
where
a
thirsty
robin
was
drinking
the
robin
evidently
did
not
fear
evelina
he
could
hear
the
soft
slow
footfalls
on
the
turf
and
the
echo
of
three
or
four
steps
upon
the
brick
walk
when
she
crossed
she
kept
carefully
within
the
line
of
his
vision
he
did
not
have
to
turn
his
head
to
see
her
when
he
did
turn
his
head
she
moved
with
equal
swiftness
not
for
a
single
pitying
instant
was
she
out
of
his
sight
farther
on
doubtless
as
he
thought
she
would
come
closer
she
might
throw
back
her
veil
as
she
had
done
on
that
terrible
night
or
lay
her
cold
hand
on
his
she
might
even
speak
to
him
what
hideous
conversations
they
might
have
he
and
the
woman
he
had
once
loved
and
to
whom
he
was
still
bound
anthony
dexter
knew
now
that
even
his
marriage
had
not
released
him
and
that
evelina
had
held
him
through
all
the
years
such
happiness
as
he
had
known
had
been
purely
negative
the
thrill
of
joyous
life
had
died
for
him
the
day
he
took
evelina
into
the
laboratory
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
caring
for
any
one
except
ralph
the
remnant
of
his
cowardly
heart
was
passionately
and
wholly
given
to
his
son
he
meditated
laying
his
case
before
ralph
as
one
physician
to
another
then
the
inmost
soul
of
him
shuddered
at
the
very
thought
rather
than
have
ralph
know
he
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
he
would
face
the
uttermost
depths
of
hell
rather
than
see
those
clear
honest
eyes
fixed
upon
him
in
judgment
he
might
go
to
the
city
to
see
a
specialist
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
accomplish
and
ralph
would
gladly
attend
to
his
work
yes
he
might
go
he
and
evelina
he
could
go
to
a
brother
physician
and
say
this
woman
haunts
me
she
saved
my
life
and
continually
follows
me
i
want
her
kept
away
what
do
you
not
see
her
too
anthony
dexter
laughed
harshly
and
fancied
that
the
veiled
figure
paused
slightly
at
the
sound
no
he
said
aloud
you
need
not
prepare
for
travel
evelina
we
shall
not
go
to
the
city
you
and
i
that
was
his
mate
walking
in
his
garden
before
him
veiled
she
was
his
and
he
was
hers
they
were
mated
as
two
atoms
of
hydrogen
and
one
of
oxygen
forming
a
molecule
of
water
all
these
years
her
suffering
had
reacted
upon
him
kept
him
from
being
happy
and
made
him
fight
continually
to
keep
her
out
of
his
remembrance
for
having
kept
her
out
he
was
paying
now
with
compound
interest
upon
a
lofty
spire
of
granite
stands
a
wireless
telegraph
instrument
fogs
are
thick
about
it
wild
surges
crash
in
the
unfathomable
depths
below
the
silence
is
that
of
chaos
before
the
first
day
of
creation
out
of
the
emptiness
a
world
away
comes
a
message
at
the
first
syllable
the
wireless
instrument
leaps
to
answer
its
mate
with
the
universe
between
them
those
two
are
bound
together
inextricably
eternally
bound
one
may
fancy
that
a
disorder
in
one
might
cause
vague
unrest
in
the
other
in
like
manner
evelina
obsession
had
preyed
upon
anthony
dexter
for
years
now
the
line
was
at
work
again
and
there
was
an
unceasing
flow
of
communication
perhaps
if
he
had
the
strength
he
might
learn
to
ignore
the
phantom
as
he
had
ignored
memory
eventually
he
might
be
able
to
put
aside
the
eternal
presence
as
he
had
put
aside
his
own
cowardice
there
was
indefinite
comfort
in
the
thought
having
preached
the
gospel
of
work
for
so
long
he
began
to
apply
it
to
himself
work
was
undoubtedly
what
he
needed
the
one
thing
which
could
set
him
right
again
after
a
little
he
could
make
the
rounds
with
ralph
and
dwell
constantly
in
the
boy
sunny
presence
in
the
meantime
there
was
his
paper
for
the
completion
of
which
one
more
experiment
was
absolutely
essential
he
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
he
wished
that
ralph
had
not
been
so
womanish
or
else
that
he
had
more
diplomatically
concealed
his
own
opinions
to
which
indeed
ralph
had
admitted
his
right
condemnation
from
ralph
was
the
one
thing
he
could
not
bear
but
after
all
was
it
needful
that
ralph
should
know
the
experiment
would
not
take
long
as
he
wished
to
satisfy
himself
on
but
one
minor
point
it
could
be
done
easily
while
ralph
was
out
upon
his
daily
round
behind
the
lilac
bushes
there
was
yet
room
for
one
more
tiny
grave
one
more
experiment
and
then
in
deference
to
ralph
foolish
effeminate
sentiments
he
would
give
it
up
one
more
heart
in
action
the
conclusion
of
his
brilliant
paper
and
then
why
he
would
be
willing
to
devote
the
rest
of
his
life
in
company
with
ralph
to
curing
measles
and
mumps
the
veiled
figure
still
paced
restlessly
back
and
forth
now
on
the
turf
and
now
on
the
brick
walk
he
closed
his
eyes
but
he
still
saw
evelina
and
noted
the
slight
difference
of
sound
in
her
footfalls
as
she
crossed
the
walk
he
heard
the
swish
of
her
skirts
as
she
lifted
them
when
she
passed
the
pool
of
water
was
it
possible
that
his
hearing
was
becoming
more
keen
he
was
sure
that
he
had
not
heard
it
from
that
distance
before
it
was
certainly
an
inviting
yard
and
the
gate
stood
temptingly
ajar
the
gravelled
highway
was
rough
for
a
little
dog
feet
and
laddie
and
the
piper
had
travelled
far
for
many
a
mile
there
had
been
no
water
and
in
this
cool
green
yard
there
was
a
small
pool
laddie
whined
softly
and
nosed
the
gate
farther
open
a
man
sat
on
the
porch
but
he
was
asleep
anyhow
his
eyes
were
closed
perhaps
he
had
a
dog
of
his
own
at
any
rate
he
could
not
object
to
a
tired
yellow
mongrel
quenching
his
thirst
at
his
pool
the
piper
had
gone
on
without
observing
that
his
wayworn
companion
had
stopped
except
for
a
mob
of
boys
who
had
thrown
stones
at
him
and
broken
his
leg
humans
had
been
kind
to
laddie
it
had
been
a
human
piper
tom
in
fact
who
had
rescued
him
from
the
boys
and
made
his
leg
good
again
laddie
cherished
no
resentment
against
the
mob
for
he
had
that
eternal
forgiveness
of
blows
and
neglect
which
lives
in
the
heart
of
the
commonest
cur
opening
his
eyes
anthony
dexter
noted
that
a
small
yellow
dog
was
drinking
eagerly
at
the
pool
of
water
past
which
evelina
continually
moved
she
went
by
twice
while
the
dog
was
drinking
but
he
took
no
notice
of
her
neither
robins
nor
dogs
seemed
to
fear
evelina
it
was
only
men
or
to
be
exact
one
man
who
had
hitherto
feared
nothing
save
the
turf
was
cool
and
soft
to
a
little
dog
tired
feet
laddie
walked
leisurely
toward
the
shrubbery
where
there
was
deep
and
quiet
shade
under
the
lilac
bush
he
lay
down
to
rest
but
was
presently
on
his
feet
again
curiously
exploring
the
place
he
sniffed
carefully
at
the
ground
behind
the
lilac
bushes
and
the
wiry
hair
on
his
back
bristled
there
was
something
uncanny
about
it
and
a
guarding
instinct
warned
him
away
but
what
was
this
that
lay
on
the
ground
so
soaked
with
rains
that
in
the
shade
it
had
not
yet
dried
laddie
dragged
it
out
into
the
sunlight
to
see
it
was
small
and
square
and
soft
on
the
outside
yet
hard
within
except
for
the
soft
damp
outer
covering
it
might
have
been
the
block
of
pine
with
which
piper
tom
and
he
would
play
by
the
hour
the
piper
would
throw
the
block
of
wood
far
from
him
sometimes
even
into
the
water
and
laddie
would
race
after
it
barking
gaily
when
he
brought
it
back
he
was
rewarded
with
a
pat
on
the
head
or
sometimes
a
bone
always
there
would
be
friendly
talk
perhaps
the
man
on
the
porch
had
thrown
this
and
was
waiting
for
him
to
bring
it
back
laddie
took
the
mysterious
thing
carefully
in
his
strong
jaws
and
trotted
exultantly
up
to
the
porch
wagging
his
stub
of
a
tail
strangely
enough
just
at
the
steps
the
thing
opened
and
something
small
and
cold
and
slipped
out
the
man
could
scarcely
have
seen
the
necklace
of
discoloured
pearls
before
with
an
oath
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
firmly
holding
laddie
under
his
arm
strode
into
the
house
entering
at
the
side
door
the
piper
had
reached
home
before
he
missed
his
dog
he
waited
a
little
then
called
but
there
was
no
answer
it
was
not
like
laddie
to
stray
for
he
was
usually
close
at
his
master
heels
poor
little
man
said
the
piper
to
himself
i
thinking
we
went
too
far
he
retraced
his
steps
over
the
dusty
road
searching
the
ground
he
discovered
that
laddie
tracks
ended
in
the
road
near
doctor
house
and
turned
toward
the
gate
tales
of
mysterious
horrors
vaguely
hinted
at
came
back
to
him
now
with
ominous
force
he
searched
the
yard
carefully
looking
in
every
nook
and
corner
then
a
cry
of
anguish
reached
his
ears
great
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
upon
piper
tom
forehead
as
he
burst
in
at
the
laboratory
door
on
a
narrow
table
tightly
strapped
down
lay
laddie
fully
conscious
his
faithful
heart
laid
bare
the
odour
of
anesthetics
was
so
faint
as
to
be
scarcely
noticeable
at
the
side
stood
doctor
dexter
in
a
linen
coat
with
a
pad
of
paper
and
a
short
pencil
in
his
white
firm
hands
he
was
taking
notes
with
infinite
appeal
in
his
agonised
eyes
laddie
recognised
his
master
who
at
last
had
come
too
late
piper
tom
seized
the
knife
from
the
table
and
with
a
quick
clean
stroke
ended
the
torture
doctor
dexter
looked
up
his
face
wearing
an
expression
of
insolent
inquiry
man
cried
the
piper
his
voice
shaking
have
you
never
been
loved
by
a
dog
the
silence
was
tense
but
doctor
dexter
had
taken
out
his
watch
and
was
timing
the
spasmodic
pulsations
of
the
heart
he
had
been
so
carefully
studying
aye
said
the
piper
passionately
watch
it
till
the
last
you
can
not
hurt
him
now
is
the
truest
heart
in
all
the
world
save
a
woman
and
you
do
well
to
study
it
having
no
heart
of
your
own
a
poor
beast
you
are
if
a
dog
has
never
loved
you
take
your
pencil
and
write
down
on
the
bit
of
paper
you
have
there
that
you
seen
the
heart
of
a
dog
write
down
that
you
seen
the
heart
of
one
who
left
his
own
kind
to
be
with
you
to
fight
for
you
even
against
them
write
down
that
is
a
good
honest
heart
with
red
blood
in
it
that
never
once
failed
and
never
could
fail
when
a
man
mother
casts
him
off
when
his
wife
forsakes
him
when
his
love
betrays
him
his
dog
stays
true
when
he
poor
and
his
friends
pass
him
by
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
looking
the
other
way
his
dog
fares
with
him
ready
to
starve
with
him
for
very
love
of
him
is
a
man
and
his
dog
i
thinking
against
the
whole
world
this
little
lad
here
was
only
a
yellow
mongrel
there
was
no
fine
blood
in
him
he
could
bring
in
the
birds
nor
swim
after
the
ducks
men
kill
to
amuse
themselves
he
was
worth
no
high
price
to
anybody
nobody
wanted
him
but
me
when
i
took
him
away
from
the
boys
who
were
hurting
him
and
set
his
poor
broken
leg
as
best
i
could
he
knew
me
for
his
master
and
claimed
me
then
he
walked
with
me
through
four
states
and
never
whined
he
gone
without
food
for
days
at
a
time
and
never
complained
he
been
cold
and
hungry
and
we
slept
together
more
than
once
on
the
ground
in
the
snow
with
only
one
blanket
between
us
he
kept
me
from
freezing
to
death
with
his
warm
body
he
suffered
from
thirst
the
same
as
i
and
never
so
much
as
whimpered
we
been
comrades
and
we
fared
together
as
only
man
and
dog
may
fare
when
every
man
face
was
set
against
you
did
you
never
have
a
dog
to
trust
you
when
there
was
never
a
man
nor
a
woman
you
could
call
your
friend
did
a
dog
never
come
to
you
and
lick
your
hand
when
been
bent
with
grief
you
could
stand
up
under
did
a
dog
never
come
to
you
and
put
his
cold
nose
on
your
face
did
a
dog
never
reach
out
a
friendly
paw
to
tell
you
that
you
were
not
alone
that
it
was
you
two
together
when
you
come
home
alone
late
at
night
tired
to
death
with
the
world
and
its
ways
was
there
never
a
dog
to
greet
you
with
his
bark
of
welcome
did
a
dog
never
sit
where
you
told
him
to
sit
and
guard
your
property
till
you
came
back
though
it
might
be
hours
when
you
could
trust
no
man
to
guard
your
treasures
could
you
never
trust
a
dog
man
man
the
world
has
fair
been
cruel
if
you
never
known
the
love
of
a
dog
i
heard
these
things
of
you
but
i
thought
folks
were
prattling
as
folks
will
but
dogs
never
do
i
thought
they
were
lying
about
you
that
such
things
could
be
true
they
said
you
were
cutting
up
dogs
to
learn
more
of
people
and
i
thinking
if
we
so
much
alike
as
that
is
murder
to
kill
a
dog
you
killed
him
said
anthony
dexter
speaking
for
the
first
time
i
did
yes
answered
the
piper
i
killed
him
but
was
to
keep
him
from
being
hurt
i
do
the
same
for
a
man
or
a
woman
if
there
was
need
if
was
a
child
you
had
tied
down
here
with
your
straps
cut
open
to
see
an
innocent
heart
your
own
being
black
past
all
pardon
i
do
the
same
for
the
child
and
all
the
more
quickly
if
it
was
my
own
i
never
had
a
child
i
never
had
a
woman
to
love
me
but
i
been
loved
by
a
dog
i
thought
that
even
yet
i
might
know
the
love
of
a
woman
for
a
man
who
deserves
the
love
of
a
dog
is
worthy
of
a
woman
and
a
man
who
will
torture
a
dog
will
torture
a
woman
too
laddie
said
the
piper
laying
his
hand
upon
the
body
no
man
ever
had
a
truer
comrade
and
i
not
insult
your
kind
by
calling
this
brute
a
cur
laddie
it
was
you
and
i
and
now
it
i
alone
laddie
here
the
piper
voice
broke
and
taking
up
the
knife
again
he
cut
the
straps
with
the
tears
raining
down
his
face
he
stumbled
out
of
the
laboratory
the
mutilated
body
of
his
pet
in
his
arms
anthony
dexter
looked
after
him
curiously
the
expression
of
his
face
was
slightly
changed
in
a
corner
of
the
laboratory
seeming
to
shrink
from
him
stood
the
phantom
black
figure
closely
veiled
out
of
the
echoing
stillness
came
the
passionate
accusation
a
man
who
will
torture
a
dog
will
torture
a
woman
too
he
carefully
removed
the
blood
stains
from
the
narrow
table
and
pushed
it
back
in
its
place
behind
a
screen
the
straps
were
cut
and
consequently
useless
so
he
wrapped
them
up
in
a
newspaper
and
threw
them
into
the
waste
basket
he
cleaned
his
knife
with
unusual
care
and
wiped
an
ugly
stain
from
his
forceps
then
he
took
off
his
linen
coat
folded
it
up
and
placed
it
in
the
covered
basket
which
held
soiled
linen
from
the
laboratory
he
washed
his
hands
and
copied
the
notes
he
had
made
for
there
was
blood
upon
the
page
he
tore
the
original
sheet
into
fine
bits
and
put
the
pieces
into
the
waste
basket
then
he
put
on
his
cuffs
and
his
coat
and
went
out
of
the
laboratory
he
was
dazed
and
did
not
see
that
his
own
had
filled
him
with
primeval
lust
to
torture
in
return
he
only
knew
that
his
brilliant
paper
must
remain
forever
incomplete
since
his
services
to
science
were
continually
unappreciated
and
misunderstood
what
was
one
yellow
dog
more
or
less
in
the
vast
economy
of
nature
was
he
lacking
in
discernment
because
as
piper
tom
said
he
had
never
been
loved
by
a
dog
he
sat
down
in
the
library
to
collect
himself
and
observed
with
a
curious
sense
of
detachment
that
evelina
was
walking
in
the
hall
instead
of
in
the
library
as
she
usually
did
when
he
sat
there
an
hour
or
perhaps
two
went
by
then
unexpectedly
ralph
came
home
having
paused
a
moment
outside
he
rushed
into
the
library
with
his
face
aglow
look
dad
he
cried
boyishly
holding
it
at
arm
length
see
what
i
found
on
the
steps
it
a
pearl
necklace
with
a
diamond
in
the
clasp
some
of
the
stones
are
discoloured
but
they
good
and
can
be
made
right
again
i
found
it
so
it
mine
and
i
going
to
give
it
to
the
girl
i
marry
anthony
dexter
pale
face
suddenly
became
livid
he
staggered
over
to
ralph
snatched
the
necklace
out
of
his
hand
and
ground
the
pearls
under
his
heel
no
he
cried
a
thousand
times
no
the
pearls
are
cursed
then
for
the
second
time
he
fainted
xviii
undine
it
almost
as
good
as
new
cried
araminta
gleefully
she
was
clad
in
a
sombre
calico
mother
hubbard
of
miss
mehitable
painstaking
manufacture
and
hopping
back
and
forth
on
the
bare
floor
of
her
room
at
miss
evelina
yes
answered
doctor
ralph
i
think
it
quite
as
good
as
new
he
was
filled
with
professional
pride
at
the
satisfactory
outcome
of
his
first
case
and
yet
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
idea
of
returning
to
miss
mehitable
as
perforce
she
soon
must
do
do
walk
any
more
just
now
he
said
come
here
and
sit
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
araminta
obeyed
him
unquestioningly
he
settled
her
comfortably
in
the
haircloth
and
drew
his
own
chair
closer
there
was
a
pause
then
she
looked
up
at
him
smiling
with
childish
wistfulness
are
you
sorry
it
well
he
asked
i
i
think
i
am
she
answered
shyly
the
deep
crimson
dyeing
her
face
i
ca
see
you
any
more
you
know
said
ralph
watching
her
intently
the
sweet
face
saddened
in
an
instant
and
araminta
tapped
her
foot
restlessly
upon
the
floor
perhaps
she
returned
slowly
aunt
hitty
will
be
taken
sick
oh
i
do
hope
she
will
you
miserable
little
sinner
laughed
ralph
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
aunt
hitty
would
send
for
me
if
she
were
ill
why
i
believe
she
die
first
maybe
thorpe
might
be
taken
sick
suggested
araminta
hopefully
he
old
and
sometimes
i
think
he
is
very
strong
he
insist
on
having
my
father
you
know
they
old
friends
thorpe
is
old
and
your
father
is
old
corrected
araminta
precisely
but
they
have
been
friends
long
aunt
hitty
says
you
must
always
say
what
you
mean
that
is
what
i
meant
each
is
old
and
both
are
friends
see
it
must
be
nice
to
be
men
sighed
araminta
and
have
friends
never
had
anybody
but
aunt
hitty
and
you
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
money
no
friends
nothing
but
relatives
quoted
ralph
cynically
it
hard
lines
little
maid
hard
lines
he
walked
back
and
forth
across
the
small
room
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
a
favourite
attitude
araminta
had
noted
during
the
month
of
her
illness
he
pictured
his
probable
reception
should
he
venture
to
call
upon
her
personally
as
it
was
he
stood
none
too
high
in
the
favour
of
the
dragon
as
he
was
wont
to
term
miss
mehitable
in
his
unflattering
thoughts
moreover
he
was
a
man
which
counted
heavily
against
him
since
he
had
taken
up
his
father
practice
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
miss
mehitable
view
of
marriage
and
her
determination
to
shield
araminta
from
such
an
unhappy
fate
and
araminta
had
not
been
intended
by
dame
nature
for
such
shielding
every
line
of
her
body
rounding
into
womanhood
defied
aunt
efforts
the
soft
curve
of
her
cheek
the
dimples
that
lurked
unsuspected
in
the
comers
of
her
mouth
the
grave
sweet
eyes
all
these
marked
araminta
for
love
she
had
too
a
wistful
appealing
childishness
did
you
like
the
story
book
asked
ralph
oh
so
much
i
thought
you
would
what
part
of
it
did
you
like
best
it
was
all
lovely
replied
araminta
thoughtfully
but
i
think
the
best
part
of
it
was
when
she
went
back
to
him
after
she
had
made
him
go
away
it
made
him
so
glad
to
know
that
they
were
to
talk
together
again
ralph
looked
keenly
at
araminta
the
love
of
man
and
woman
was
so
evidently
outside
her
ken
the
sleeping
princess
in
the
tower
had
been
no
more
set
apart
but
as
he
remembered
the
sleeping
princess
had
been
wakened
by
a
kiss
when
the
right
man
came
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
and
he
swallowed
hard
blindly
he
went
over
to
her
chair
the
girl
face
was
lifted
questioningly
to
his
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
full
upon
the
lips
araminta
shrank
from
him
a
little
and
the
colour
surged
into
her
face
but
her
eyes
still
trustful
still
tender
never
wavered
from
his
i
suppose
i
a
brute
ralph
said
huskily
but
god
knows
i
meant
to
be
araminta
smiled
a
sweet
uncomprehending
smile
ralph
possessed
himself
of
her
hand
it
was
warm
and
steady
his
own
was
cold
and
tremulous
child
he
said
did
any
one
ever
kiss
you
before
no
replied
araminta
only
aunt
hitty
it
was
when
i
was
a
baby
and
she
thought
i
was
lost
she
kissed
me
here
araminta
pointed
to
her
soft
cheek
did
you
kiss
me
because
i
was
well
ralph
shook
his
head
despairingly
the
man
in
the
book
kissed
the
lady
went
on
araminta
happily
because
he
was
so
glad
they
were
to
talk
together
again
but
we
why
i
shall
never
see
you
any
more
she
concluded
sadly
his
fingers
tightened
upon
hers
yes
he
said
in
a
strange
voice
we
shall
see
each
other
again
they
both
seem
very
well
sighed
araminta
referring
to
aunt
hitty
and
thorpe
and
even
if
i
fell
off
of
a
ladder
again
it
might
not
hurt
me
at
all
i
have
fallen
from
lots
of
places
and
only
got
black
and
blue
i
never
broke
before
listen
child
said
ralph
would
you
rather
live
with
aunt
hitty
or
with
me
why
doctor
ralph
of
course
i
rather
live
with
you
but
aunt
hitty
would
never
let
me
we
not
talking
about
aunt
hitty
now
is
there
anyone
in
the
world
whom
you
like
better
than
you
do
me
no
said
araminta
softly
her
eyes
shining
how
could
there
be
do
you
love
me
araminta
yes
she
answered
sweetly
of
course
i
do
you
been
so
good
to
me
the
tone
made
the
words
meaningless
child
said
ralph
you
break
my
heart
he
walked
back
and
forth
again
restlessly
and
araminta
watched
him
vaguely
troubled
what
in
the
world
had
she
done
meanwhile
he
was
meditating
he
could
not
bear
to
have
her
go
back
to
her
prison
even
for
a
little
while
had
he
found
her
only
to
lose
her
because
she
had
no
soul
presently
he
came
back
to
her
and
stood
by
her
chair
listen
dear
he
said
tenderly
you
told
me
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
for
whom
you
cared
more
than
you
care
for
me
you
said
you
loved
me
and
i
love
you
god
knows
i
do
if
you
trust
me
araminta
you
never
be
sorry
never
for
one
single
minute
as
long
as
you
live
would
you
like
to
live
with
me
in
a
little
house
with
roses
climbing
over
it
just
us
two
alone
yes
returned
araminta
dreamily
and
i
could
keep
the
little
cat
you
can
have
a
million
cats
if
you
like
but
all
i
want
is
you
just
you
sweetheart
to
love
me
with
all
the
love
you
can
give
me
will
you
come
oh
cried
araminta
if
aunt
hitty
would
only
let
me
but
she
never
would
we
wo
ask
her
returned
ralph
we
go
away
and
be
married
at
the
word
araminta
started
out
of
her
chair
her
face
was
white
and
her
eyes
wide
with
fear
i
could
she
said
with
difficulty
you
should
ask
me
to
do
what
you
know
is
wrong
just
because
my
mother
was
married
because
she
was
wicked
you
must
not
think
that
i
would
be
wicked
too
hot
words
were
struggling
for
utterance
but
ralph
choked
them
back
the
fog
was
thick
before
him
and
he
saw
araminta
as
through
a
heavy
veil
undine
he
said
moistening
his
parched
lips
some
day
you
will
find
your
soul
and
when
you
do
come
to
me
i
shall
be
waiting
he
went
out
of
the
room
unsteadily
and
closed
the
door
he
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
for
a
long
time
before
he
went
down
apparently
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
he
went
into
the
parlour
and
sat
down
wiping
the
cold
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
trying
to
regain
his
he
saw
clearly
that
araminta
was
not
in
the
least
to
blame
that
almost
ever
since
her
birth
she
had
been
under
the
thumb
of
a
domineering
woman
who
persistently
inculcated
her
own
warped
ideas
since
her
earliest
childhood
araminta
had
been
taught
that
marriage
was
wrong
that
her
own
mother
was
wicked
because
she
had
been
married
and
of
the
love
between
man
and
woman
the
child
knew
absolutely
nothing
good
god
muttered
ralph
my
little
girl
oh
my
little
girl
he
loved
her
more
than
ever
because
she
had
denied
him
he
wanted
her
now
as
he
had
never
wanted
her
before
through
the
weeks
that
he
had
seen
her
every
day
he
had
grown
to
feel
his
need
of
her
to
hunger
for
the
sweetness
of
her
absolute
dependence
upon
him
yet
until
now
he
had
not
guessed
how
deeply
he
cared
nor
guessed
that
such
caring
was
possible
he
sat
there
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
slowly
regaining
command
of
himself
miss
evelina
came
through
the
hall
and
paused
just
outside
the
door
feeling
intuitively
that
some
one
was
in
the
house
she
drew
down
her
veil
and
went
in
i
thought
you
had
gone
she
said
did
you
wish
to
see
me
no
returned
ralph
wearily
not
especially
she
sat
down
opposite
him
silently
all
her
movements
were
quiet
for
she
had
never
been
the
noisy
sort
of
woman
there
was
something
soothing
in
the
veiled
presence
i
hope
i
not
intruding
ventured
ralph
at
length
i
go
presently
i
just
had
a
well
a
blow
that
little
saint
upstairs
has
been
taught
that
marriage
is
wicked
i
know
returned
miss
evelina
instantly
comprehending
mehitable
has
very
strange
ideas
i
sorry
she
added
in
a
tone
she
might
have
used
in
speaking
to
anthony
dexter
years
before
her
sympathy
touched
the
right
chord
it
was
not
obtrusive
it
had
no
hint
of
pity
it
was
simply
that
one
who
had
been
hurt
fully
understood
the
hurt
of
another
ralph
felt
a
mysterious
kinship
i
wanted
for
some
time
to
ask
you
he
began
awkwardly
if
there
was
not
something
i
could
do
for
you
the
the
veil
you
know
he
stopped
at
a
loss
for
further
words
yes
miss
evelina
voice
was
politely
inquiring
she
thought
it
odd
for
anthony
dexter
son
to
be
concerned
about
her
veil
she
wondered
whether
he
meditated
giving
her
a
box
of
chiffon
as
piper
tom
had
done
believe
me
he
said
impetuously
i
only
want
to
help
i
want
to
make
it
possible
for
you
to
take
that
to
take
that
thing
off
it
is
not
possible
returned
miss
evelina
after
a
painful
interval
i
shall
always
wear
my
veil
you
do
understand
explained
ralph
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
spent
the
day
telling
women
they
did
not
understand
i
know
of
course
that
there
was
some
dreadful
accident
and
that
it
happened
a
long
time
ago
since
then
wonderful
advances
have
been
made
in
surgery
there
is
a
great
deal
possible
now
that
was
not
dreamed
of
then
of
course
i
should
not
think
of
attempting
it
myself
but
i
would
find
the
man
who
could
do
it
take
you
to
him
and
stand
by
you
until
it
was
over
the
clock
ticked
loudly
and
a
little
bird
sang
outside
but
there
was
no
other
sound
i
want
to
help
you
said
ralph
humbly
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
believe
me
i
want
to
help
you
miss
evelina
said
nothing
but
she
followed
him
to
the
door
at
the
threshold
ralph
turned
back
wo
you
let
me
help
you
he
asked
wo
you
even
let
me
try
i
thank
you
said
miss
evelina
coldly
but
nothing
can
be
done
the
door
closed
behind
him
with
a
portentous
suggestion
of
finality
as
he
went
down
the
path
ralph
felt
himself
shut
out
from
love
and
from
all
human
service
he
did
not
look
back
to
the
upper
window
where
araminta
was
watching
her
face
stained
with
tears
as
he
went
out
of
the
gate
she
too
felt
shut
out
from
something
strangely
new
and
sweet
but
her
conscience
rigidly
approved
none
the
less
against
aunt
hitty
moral
precepts
araminta
leaned
securely
and
she
was
sure
that
she
had
done
right
the
maltese
kitten
was
purring
upon
a
cushion
the
loved
story
book
lay
on
the
table
nearby
doctor
ralph
was
going
down
the
road
his
head
bowed
they
would
never
see
each
other
again
never
in
all
the
world
she
would
not
tell
aunt
hitty
that
doctor
ralph
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
would
shield
him
even
though
he
had
insulted
her
she
would
not
tell
aunt
hitty
that
doctor
ralph
had
kissed
her
as
the
man
in
the
story
book
had
kissed
the
lady
who
came
back
to
him
she
would
not
tell
anybody
never
in
all
the
world
thought
araminta
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
doctor
ralph
was
out
of
sight
now
and
she
could
never
watch
for
him
any
more
he
had
gone
away
forever
and
she
had
broken
his
heart
for
the
moment
araminta
straightened
herself
proudly
for
she
had
been
taught
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
one
heart
broke
or
not
one
must
always
do
what
was
right
and
aunt
hitty
knew
what
was
right
suddenly
she
sank
on
her
knees
beside
her
bed
burying
her
face
in
the
pillow
for
her
heart
was
breaking
too
oh
lord
she
prayed
sobbing
wildly
keep
me
from
the
contamination
of
marriage
for
thy
sake
amen
the
door
opened
silently
a
soft
slow
step
came
near
the
pillow
was
drawn
away
and
a
cool
hand
was
laid
upon
araminta
burning
cheek
child
said
miss
evelina
what
is
wrong
araminta
had
not
meant
to
tell
but
she
did
she
sobbed
out
in
disjointed
fragments
all
the
sorry
tale
wisely
miss
evelina
waited
until
the
storm
had
spent
itself
secretly
wishing
that
she
too
might
know
the
relief
of
tears
i
knew
said
miss
evelina
her
cool
quiet
hand
still
upon
face
doctor
ralph
told
me
before
he
went
home
oh
cried
araminta
does
he
hate
me
hate
you
repeated
miss
evelina
dear
child
no
he
loves
you
would
you
believe
me
araminta
if
i
told
you
that
it
was
not
wrong
to
be
married
that
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
not
marry
the
man
who
loves
you
not
wrong
exclaimed
araminta
incredulously
aunt
hitty
says
it
is
my
mother
was
married
yes
said
miss
evelina
and
so
was
mine
aunt
hitty
mother
was
married
too
are
you
sure
demanded
araminta
she
never
told
me
so
if
her
mother
was
married
why
did
she
tell
me
i
do
know
dear
returned
miss
evelina
truthfully
ways
are
strange
had
she
been
asked
to
choose
at
the
moment
between
araminta
dense
ignorance
and
all
of
her
own
knowledge
embracing
as
it
did
a
world
of
pain
she
would
have
chosen
gladly
the
fuller
life
the
below
rang
loudly
defiantly
it
was
the
kind
of
a
ring
which
might
impel
the
dead
to
answer
it
miss
evelina
fairly
ran
downstairs
outside
stood
miss
mehitable
unwillingly
in
her
wake
had
come
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
under
miss
mehitable
capable
and
constant
direction
he
had
made
a
stretcher
out
of
the
clothes
poles
and
a
sheet
he
was
jaded
in
spirit
beyond
all
words
to
express
but
he
had
come
as
roman
captives
came
chained
to
the
chariot
wheels
of
the
conqueror
me
and
the
minister
announced
miss
mehitable
imperiously
have
come
to
take
minty
home
xix
in
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
the
house
seemed
lonely
without
araminta
miss
evelina
missed
the
child
more
than
she
had
supposed
she
could
ever
miss
any
one
she
had
grown
to
love
her
and
too
she
missed
the
work
miss
evelina
house
was
clean
now
and
most
of
the
necessary
labour
had
been
performed
by
her
own
frail
hands
the
care
of
araminta
had
been
an
added
burden
which
she
had
borne
because
it
had
been
forced
upon
her
slowly
but
surely
she
had
been
compelled
to
take
thought
for
others
the
promise
of
spring
had
come
to
beautiful
fulfilment
and
the
world
was
all
abloom
faint
mists
of
may
were
rising
from
the
earth
and
filmy
clouds
half
veiled
the
moon
the
loneliness
of
the
house
was
unbearable
so
miss
evelina
went
out
into
the
garden
her
veil
fluttering
about
her
head
the
old
pain
was
still
at
her
heart
yet
in
a
way
it
was
changed
she
had
come
again
into
the
field
of
service
miss
mehitable
had
been
kind
to
her
indeed
more
than
kind
the
piper
had
made
her
a
garden
and
she
had
taken
care
of
araminta
doctor
ralph
meaning
to
be
wholly
kind
had
offered
to
help
her
if
he
could
and
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
doing
a
small
service
for
him
when
fate
in
the
person
of
miss
mehitable
intervened
and
over
and
above
and
beyond
all
anthony
dexter
had
come
back
to
offer
her
tardy
reparation
that
hour
was
continually
present
with
her
she
could
not
forget
his
tortured
face
when
she
had
thrown
back
her
veil
what
if
she
had
taken
him
at
his
word
and
gone
with
him
to
be
as
he
said
a
mother
to
his
son
miss
evelina
laughed
bitterly
the
beauty
of
the
night
brought
her
no
peace
as
she
wandered
about
the
garden
without
knowing
it
she
longed
for
human
companionship
piper
tom
had
finished
his
work
doctor
ralph
would
come
no
more
araminta
had
gone
and
miss
mehitable
offered
little
comfort
she
went
to
the
gate
and
leaned
upon
it
looking
down
the
road
thus
she
had
watched
for
anthony
dexter
in
years
gone
by
memories
mercilessly
keen
returned
to
her
as
though
it
were
yesterday
she
remembered
the
moonlit
night
of
their
betrothal
felt
his
eager
arms
about
her
and
his
bearded
cheek
pressed
close
to
hers
she
heard
again
the
music
of
his
voice
as
he
whispered
passionately
i
love
you
oh
i
love
you
for
life
for
death
for
all
eternity
the
had
been
carefully
pruned
and
tied
up
but
it
promised
little
at
best
the
cypress
had
grown
steadily
and
at
times
its
long
shadow
reached
through
the
door
and
into
the
house
heavily
too
upon
her
heart
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
lay
for
sorrow
seems
so
much
deeper
than
joy
a
figure
came
up
the
road
and
she
turned
away
intending
to
go
into
the
house
then
she
perceived
that
it
was
piper
tom
and
drawing
down
her
veil
turned
back
to
wait
for
him
he
had
never
come
at
night
before
even
in
the
darkness
she
noted
a
change
in
him
the
atmosphere
of
youth
was
all
gone
he
walked
slowly
as
though
he
had
aged
and
the
red
feather
no
longer
bobbed
in
his
hat
he
went
past
her
silently
and
sat
down
on
the
steps
will
you
come
in
asked
evelina
no
answered
the
piper
sadly
i
not
be
coming
in
is
selfish
of
me
perhaps
but
i
came
to
you
because
i
had
sorrow
of
my
own
miss
evelina
sat
down
on
the
step
beside
him
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
is
a
small
sorrow
perhaps
you
be
thinking
he
said
at
last
i
not
knowing
what
great
ones
you
have
seen
face
to
face
but
is
so
ordered
that
all
sorrows
are
not
the
same
is
all
in
the
heart
that
bears
them
i
told
you
i
had
known
them
all
and
at
the
time
i
was
thinking
i
spoke
the
truth
a
woman
never
loved
me
and
so
i
have
lost
the
love
of
no
woman
but
he
went
on
with
difficulty
no
one
had
ever
killed
my
dog
how
asked
miss
evelina
dully
it
seemed
a
matter
of
small
moment
to
her
i
not
be
paining
you
with
that
the
piper
answered
at
the
last
was
i
who
killed
him
to
save
him
from
further
hurt
was
the
best
i
could
do
for
the
little
lad
and
i
thinking
he
take
it
from
me
rather
than
from
any
one
else
i
missing
his
cheerful
bark
and
his
pleasant
ways
but
i
taken
him
away
for
ever
from
doctor
dexter
and
his
kind
doctor
dexter
evelina
sprang
to
her
feet
her
body
tense
and
quivering
aye
doctor
dexter
not
the
young
man
but
the
old
one
a
breath
was
her
only
answer
but
the
piper
looked
up
startled
slowly
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
leaned
toward
her
intently
as
though
to
see
her
face
behind
her
veil
spinner
in
the
shadow
he
said
with
infinite
tenderness
thinking
was
he
who
hurt
you
too
evelina
head
drooped
she
swayed
and
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
put
his
arm
around
her
she
sat
down
on
the
step
again
and
hid
her
veiled
face
in
her
hands
was
that
i
thinking
that
brought
me
to
you
he
went
on
i
knew
you
did
not
care
much
for
the
little
lad
he
was
naught
to
any
one
but
me
is
this
that
binds
us
together
you
and
i
the
moon
climbed
higher
into
the
heavens
and
the
clouds
were
blown
away
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
was
thrown
toward
them
and
the
dense
night
of
it
concealed
the
door
see
breathed
evelina
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
is
long
aye
answered
piper
tom
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
is
long
and
the
rose
blooms
but
once
a
year
is
the
way
of
the
world
he
loosened
his
flute
from
the
cord
by
which
it
was
slung
over
his
shoulder
i
was
going
to
the
woods
he
said
but
at
the
last
i
could
not
for
the
little
lad
always
fared
with
me
when
i
went
out
to
play
he
would
sit
quite
still
when
i
made
the
music
so
still
that
he
never
frightened
even
the
birds
the
birds
came
too
is
a
way
i
had
for
long
he
continued
i
never
could
be
learning
the
printed
music
so
i
made
music
of
my
own
so
many
laughed
at
it
not
hearing
any
tune
that
i
always
played
by
myself
was
my
own
soul
breathing
into
it
perhaps
i
not
to
blame
that
it
never
made
a
tune
sometimes
i
thinking
that
there
may
be
tunes
and
tunes
i
was
once
in
a
place
where
there
were
many
instruments
all
playing
at
once
and
there
was
nothing
came
from
it
that
one
could
call
a
tune
but
was
great
and
beautiful
beyond
any
words
of
mine
to
tell
you
and
the
master
of
them
all
standing
up
in
front
knew
just
when
each
must
play
most
of
course
i
watched
the
one
who
played
the
flute
and
listened
to
the
voice
of
it
is
strange
how
if
you
listen
you
can
pick
out
one
instrument
from
all
the
rest
i
saw
that
sometimes
he
did
not
play
at
all
and
yet
the
music
went
on
sometimes
again
he
was
privileged
to
play
just
a
note
or
two
not
at
all
like
a
tune
was
just
his
part
and
by
itself
it
would
have
sounded
queer
i
might
have
laughed
at
it
myself
if
i
did
not
know
and
was
listening
for
a
tune
but
the
master
of
them
all
was
pleased
because
the
man
with
the
flute
made
his
few
notes
to
sing
rightly
when
they
should
sing
and
because
he
kept
still
when
there
was
no
need
of
his
instrument
so
i
thinking
concluded
the
piper
humbly
that
these
few
notes
of
mine
may
belong
to
something
i
can
not
hear
and
that
the
master
himself
leads
me
when
is
time
to
play
he
put
the
instrument
to
his
lips
and
began
to
play
softly
the
low
sweet
notes
were
as
he
said
no
evident
part
of
a
tune
yet
they
were
not
without
a
deep
and
tender
appeal
evelina
listened
her
head
still
bowed
it
did
not
sound
like
the
pipes
o
pan
but
rather
like
some
fragment
of
a
mysterious
melody
faint
far
echoes
rang
back
from
the
surrounding
hills
as
though
in
a
distant
forest
cathedral
another
piper
sat
enthroned
the
sound
of
singing
waters
murmured
through
the
night
as
the
flute
breathed
of
stream
and
sea
there
was
the
rush
of
a
summer
wind
through
swaying
branches
the
tinkle
of
raindrops
the
deep
notes
of
rising
storm
moonlight
shimmered
through
it
birds
sang
in
green
silences
and
there
was
scent
of
birch
and
pine
then
swiftly
the
music
changed
through
the
utter
sadness
of
it
came
also
a
hint
of
peace
as
though
one
had
planted
a
garden
of
roses
and
instead
there
had
come
up
herbs
and
balm
in
the
passionate
pain
there
was
also
uplifting
a
flight
on
broken
wings
above
and
beyond
all
there
was
a
haunting
question
to
which
the
answer
seemed
lost
at
length
the
piper
laid
down
his
flute
you
do
not
laugh
he
said
and
yet
i
thinking
you
may
not
care
for
music
that
has
no
tune
i
do
care
returned
evelina
i
remember
he
answered
slowly
it
was
the
day
in
the
woods
when
i
called
you
and
you
came
i
was
hurt
she
said
i
had
been
terribly
hurt
only
that
morning
yes
many
have
come
to
me
so
often
when
i
have
played
in
the
woods
the
music
that
has
no
tune
some
one
who
was
very
sad
has
come
to
me
i
saw
you
that
day
from
far
and
i
felt
you
were
sad
so
i
called
you
i
called
you
he
repeated
lingering
on
the
words
and
you
came
i
do
not
so
much
care
for
the
printed
music
he
went
on
after
an
interval
unless
it
might
be
the
great
beautiful
music
which
takes
so
many
to
play
i
have
often
thought
of
it
and
wondered
what
might
happen
if
the
players
were
not
willing
to
follow
the
master
if
one
should
play
a
tune
where
no
tune
was
written
and
he
who
has
the
violin
should
insist
on
playing
the
flute
i
would
not
want
the
violin
for
i
think
the
flute
is
best
of
all
it
is
made
from
the
trees
on
the
mountains
and
the
silver
hidden
within
and
so
is
best
fitted
for
the
message
of
the
mountains
the
great
high
music
i
thinking
that
the
life
we
live
is
not
unlike
the
players
we
have
each
our
own
instrument
but
we
are
not
content
to
follow
as
the
master
leads
we
do
not
like
the
low
long
notes
that
mean
sadness
we
will
not
take
what
is
meant
for
us
but
insist
on
the
dancing
tunes
and
the
light
music
of
pleasure
it
is
this
that
makes
the
discord
and
all
the
confusion
the
master
knows
his
meaning
and
could
we
each
play
our
part
well
at
the
right
time
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
in
all
the
world
miss
evelina
sighed
deeply
and
the
piper
put
his
hand
on
hers
i
not
meaning
to
reproach
you
he
said
kindly
though
truly
i
do
think
you
have
played
wrong
in
any
music
i
have
heard
there
has
never
been
any
one
instrument
that
has
played
all
the
time
and
sadly
when
there
is
sadness
there
is
always
rest
and
you
have
had
no
rest
no
said
evelina
her
voice
breaking
i
have
had
no
rest
god
knows
that
then
do
you
not
see
asked
the
piper
very
gently
that
you
can
not
help
but
make
the
music
wrong
the
master
gives
you
one
deep
note
to
play
and
you
hold
it
always
the
same
note
till
the
music
is
at
an
end
is
something
wrong
i
thinking
that
has
made
you
hold
it
so
i
not
asking
you
to
tell
me
but
i
think
that
one
day
i
shall
see
together
we
shall
find
what
makes
the
music
wrong
and
together
we
shall
make
it
right
again
together
repeated
evelina
unconsciously
once
the
word
had
been
sweet
to
her
but
now
it
brought
only
bitterness
aye
together
is
for
that
i
stayed
laddie
and
i
were
going
on
that
very
day
we
saw
you
in
the
wood
the
day
i
called
you
and
you
came
i
shall
see
some
day
what
has
made
it
wrong
yes
spinner
in
the
shadow
i
shall
see
i
grieving
now
for
laddie
and
my
heart
is
sore
but
when
i
have
forgiven
him
i
shall
be
at
rest
forgiven
who
queried
evelina
why
the
man
who
hurt
laddie
the
same
i
thinking
who
hurt
you
but
your
hurt
was
worse
than
laddie
i
take
it
and
so
is
harder
to
forgive
evelina
heart
beat
hard
never
before
had
she
thought
of
forgiving
anthony
dexter
she
put
it
aside
quickly
as
altogether
impossible
moreover
he
had
not
asked
what
is
it
to
forgive
she
questioned
curiously
the
word
is
not
made
right
answered
the
piper
i
thinking
is
wrong
end
to
as
many
things
in
this
world
are
until
we
move
and
look
at
them
from
another
way
it
giving
for
that
all
when
you
have
put
self
so
wholly
aside
that
you
can
be
sorry
for
him
because
he
has
wronged
you
why
then
you
have
forgiven
i
shall
never
be
able
to
do
that
she
returned
why
i
should
not
even
try
ah
cried
the
piper
i
knew
that
some
day
i
should
find
what
was
wrong
but
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
now
is
because
you
have
not
forgiven
that
you
have
been
sad
for
so
long
when
you
have
forgiven
you
will
be
free
he
never
asked
muttered
evelina
no
is
very
strange
i
thinking
but
those
who
most
need
to
be
forgiven
are
those
who
never
ask
is
hard
i
know
for
i
can
not
yet
be
sorry
for
him
because
he
hurt
laddie
i
can
only
be
sorry
for
laddie
who
was
hurt
but
the
great
truth
is
there
when
i
have
grown
to
where
i
can
be
sorry
for
him
as
well
as
for
laddie
why
my
grieving
will
be
done
the
little
chap
mused
the
piper
fondly
he
was
a
faithful
comrade
was
a
true
heart
that
the
brute
ah
what
am
i
saying
i
not
be
forgetting
how
he
fared
with
me
in
sun
and
storm
sharing
a
crust
with
me
often
as
man
to
man
and
not
complaining
because
we
were
together
a
woman
never
loved
me
but
a
dog
has
and
i
thinking
that
some
day
i
may
have
the
greater
love
because
i
been
worthy
of
the
less
my
mother
died
when
i
was
born
and
because
of
that
i
tried
to
make
the
world
easier
for
all
women
i
not
thinking
i
have
wholly
failed
yet
the
great
love
has
not
come
i
often
thought
went
on
piper
tom
simply
that
if
a
woman
waited
for
me
at
night
when
i
went
home
with
love
on
her
face
and
if
a
woman
hand
might
be
in
mine
when
the
master
tells
me
that
i
am
no
longer
needed
for
the
music
would
make
the
leaving
very
easy
and
i
should
not
ask
for
heaven
i
seen
so
often
the
precious
jewel
of
a
woman
love
cast
aside
by
a
man
who
did
not
know
what
he
had
having
blinded
himself
with
tinsel
until
his
true
knowledge
was
lost
you
forgive
me
for
my
rambling
talk
i
thinking
for
i
still
grieving
for
the
little
chap
and
i
can
not
say
yet
that
i
have
forgiven
he
rose
slung
his
flute
over
his
shoulder
again
and
went
slowly
toward
the
gate
evelina
followed
him
to
the
cypress
tree
see
he
said
turning
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
is
long
is
because
you
have
not
forgiven
i
thinking
it
may
be
easier
for
us
to
forgive
together
since
it
is
the
same
man
yes
returned
evelina
steadily
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
is
long
and
i
never
shall
forgive
aye
said
the
piper
we
forgive
him
together
you
and
help
you
since
your
hurt
is
greater
than
mine
you
have
veiled
your
soul
as
you
have
veiled
your
face
but
through
forgiveness
the
beauty
of
the
one
will
shine
out
again
and
i
thinking
through
love
the
other
may
shine
out
too
you
have
hidden
your
face
because
you
are
so
beautiful
you
have
hidden
your
soul
because
you
are
so
sad
i
called
you
in
the
woods
and
i
call
you
now
i
shall
never
cease
calling
until
you
come
he
went
out
of
the
gate
and
did
not
answer
her
faint
was
it
true
as
he
said
that
he
should
never
cease
calling
her
something
in
her
spirit
stirred
strangely
at
his
appeal
as
a
far
celestial
trumpet
blown
from
on
high
might
summon
the
valiant
soul
of
a
warrior
who
had
died
in
the
charge
xx
the
secret
of
the
veil
father
said
ralph
pacing
back
and
forth
as
was
his
habit
i
have
wanted
for
some
time
to
ask
you
about
miss
evelina
the
woman
you
know
in
the
little
house
on
the
hill
she
always
wears
a
veil
and
there
can
be
no
reason
for
it
except
some
terrible
disfigurement
has
she
never
consulted
you
never
answered
anthony
dexter
with
dry
lips
i
remember
you
told
me
but
it
seems
strange
i
spoke
to
her
about
it
the
other
day
i
told
her
i
was
sure
that
something
could
be
done
i
offered
to
find
the
best
available
specialist
for
her
go
with
her
and
stand
by
her
until
it
was
over
anthony
dexter
laughed
a
harsh
unnatural
laugh
that
jarred
upon
his
son
i
fail
to
see
anything
particularly
funny
about
it
remarked
ralph
coldly
what
did
she
say
asked
his
father
not
daring
to
meet
ralph
eyes
she
thanked
me
and
said
nothing
could
be
done
she
did
show
you
her
face
i
take
it
no
i
should
have
thought
she
would
under
the
circumstances
under
all
the
circumstances
have
you
seen
her
face
asked
ralph
quickly
by
chance
or
in
any
other
way
yes
how
is
it
is
it
so
bad
that
nothing
can
be
done
she
was
perfectly
right
returned
anthony
dexter
slowly
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
at
the
moment
the
phantom
evelina
was
pacing
back
and
forth
between
the
man
and
his
son
her
veiled
face
was
proudly
turned
away
i
wonder
thought
anthony
dexter
curiously
if
she
hears
if
she
did
though
she
speak
or
throw
back
her
veil
so
she
does
hear
i
may
be
wrong
sighed
ralph
but
i
always
believed
that
nothing
is
so
bad
it
ca
be
made
better
the
unfailing
of
youth
my
son
returned
anthony
dexter
patronisingly
you
get
over
that
he
laughed
again
gratingly
and
went
out
followed
by
his
persistent
apparition
we
go
out
for
a
walk
evelina
he
muttered
when
he
was
to
the
gate
we
see
how
far
you
can
go
without
getting
tired
the
fantastic
notion
of
wearying
his
veiled
pursuer
appealed
to
him
strongly
ralph
watched
his
father
uneasily
even
though
he
had
been
relieved
of
the
greater
part
of
his
work
anthony
dexter
did
not
seem
to
be
improving
he
was
morose
unreasonable
and
given
to
staring
vacantly
into
space
for
hours
at
a
time
ralph
often
spoke
to
him
when
he
did
not
hear
at
all
and
at
times
he
turned
his
head
from
left
to
right
and
back
again
slowly
but
with
the
maddening
regularity
of
he
ate
little
but
claimed
to
sleep
well
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
be
of
the
mind
rather
than
the
body
and
ralph
could
find
nothing
in
his
father
circumstances
calculated
to
worry
any
one
in
the
slightest
degree
he
planned
vaguely
to
invite
a
friend
who
was
skilled
in
the
diagnosis
of
obscure
mental
disorders
to
spend
a
with
him
a
little
later
on
and
to
ask
him
to
observe
his
father
closely
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
anthony
dexter
would
see
quickly
through
so
flimsy
a
pretence
but
unless
he
improved
something
of
the
kind
would
have
to
be
done
soon
meanwhile
his
heart
yearned
strangely
toward
miss
evelina
it
was
altogether
possible
that
something
might
be
done
ralph
was
modest
but
new
discoveries
were
constantly
being
made
and
he
knew
that
his
own
knowledge
was
more
abreast
of
the
times
than
his
father
could
be
at
any
rate
he
was
not
so
easily
satisfied
he
was
trying
faithfully
to
forget
araminta
but
was
not
succeeding
the
sweet
childish
face
haunted
him
as
constantly
as
the
veiled
phantom
haunted
his
father
but
in
a
different
way
through
his
own
unhappiness
he
came
into
kinship
with
all
the
misery
of
the
world
he
longed
to
uplift
to
help
to
heal
he
decided
to
try
once
more
to
talk
with
miss
evelina
to
ask
her
point
blank
if
need
be
to
let
him
see
her
face
he
knew
that
his
father
lacked
sympathy
and
he
was
sure
that
when
miss
evelina
once
thoroughly
understood
him
she
would
be
willing
to
let
him
help
her
on
the
way
uphill
he
considered
how
he
should
approach
the
subject
he
had
already
planned
to
make
an
ostensible
errand
of
the
book
he
had
loaned
araminta
perhaps
miss
evelina
had
read
it
or
would
like
to
and
he
could
begin
in
that
way
to
talk
to
her
when
he
reached
the
gate
the
house
seemed
deserted
though
the
front
door
was
ajar
it
was
a
warm
sweet
afternoon
in
early
summer
and
the
world
was
very
still
except
for
the
winged
folk
of
wood
and
field
he
tapped
gently
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
answer
he
went
around
to
the
back
door
but
it
was
closed
and
there
was
no
sign
that
the
place
was
occupied
except
quantities
of
white
chiffon
hung
upon
the
line
being
a
man
ralph
did
not
perceive
that
miss
evelina
had
washed
every
veil
she
possessed
he
went
back
to
the
front
of
the
house
again
and
found
that
the
door
was
still
ajar
she
might
have
gone
away
though
it
seemed
unlikely
or
it
was
not
impossible
that
she
might
have
been
taken
suddenly
ill
and
was
unable
to
come
to
the
door
ralph
went
in
softly
as
he
had
often
done
before
miss
evelina
had
frequently
left
the
door
open
for
him
at
the
hour
he
was
expected
to
visit
his
patient
he
paused
a
moment
in
the
hall
but
heard
no
sound
save
slow
deep
breathing
he
turned
into
the
parlour
but
stopped
on
the
threshold
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
changed
to
stone
upon
the
couch
lay
miss
evelina
asleep
and
unveiled
her
face
was
turned
toward
him
a
face
of
such
surpassing
beauty
that
he
gasped
in
astonishment
he
had
never
seen
such
wondrous
perfection
of
line
and
feature
nor
such
a
crown
of
splendour
as
her
lustreless
white
hair
falling
loosely
about
her
shoulders
her
face
was
as
pure
and
as
cold
as
marble
flawless
and
singularly
transparent
her
lips
were
deep
scarlet
and
perfectly
shaped
the
white
slender
column
of
her
throat
held
her
head
proudly
long
dark
lashes
swept
her
cheek
and
the
years
had
left
no
lines
feeling
the
intense
scrutiny
miss
evelina
opened
her
eyes
slowly
like
one
still
half
asleep
her
eyes
were
violet
so
deep
in
colour
as
to
seem
almost
black
she
stared
at
ralph
unseeing
then
the
light
of
recognition
flashed
over
her
face
and
she
sat
up
reaching
back
quickly
for
her
missing
veil
miss
evelina
cried
ralph
why
oh
why
why
did
you
come
in
she
demanded
resentfully
you
had
no
right
forgive
me
he
pleaded
coming
to
her
i
often
come
in
when
the
door
was
open
why
you
left
it
open
for
me
yourself
do
you
know
you
have
perhaps
she
answered
a
faint
colour
coming
into
her
cheek
i
had
no
idea
of
going
to
sleep
i
am
sorry
i
thought
you
might
be
ill
said
ralph
excusing
himself
further
believe
me
miss
evelina
i
had
no
thought
of
intruding
i
only
came
to
help
you
he
stood
before
her
still
staring
and
her
eyes
met
his
clearly
in
return
in
the
violet
depths
was
a
world
of
knowledge
and
pain
suffering
had
transfigured
her
face
into
a
noble
beauty
for
which
there
were
no
words
such
a
face
might
be
the
dream
of
a
sculptor
the
despair
of
a
painter
and
the
ecstasy
of
a
lover
why
cried
ralph
again
because
she
answered
simply
my
beauty
was
my
curse
ralph
did
not
see
that
the
words
were
melodramatic
he
only
sat
down
weakly
in
a
chair
opposite
her
he
never
once
took
his
eyes
away
from
her
but
stared
at
her
helplessly
like
a
man
in
a
dream
why
he
questioned
again
tell
me
why
it
was
in
a
laboratory
explained
miss
evelina
i
was
there
with
the
man
i
loved
and
to
whom
i
was
to
be
married
the
next
day
no
one
knew
of
our
engagement
for
in
a
small
town
you
know
people
will
talk
and
we
both
felt
that
it
was
too
sacred
to
be
spoken
of
lightly
he
was
trying
an
experiment
and
i
was
watching
he
came
to
the
retort
to
put
in
another
chemical
and
leaned
over
it
i
heard
the
mass
seething
and
pushed
him
away
with
all
my
strength
instantly
there
was
a
terrible
explosion
when
i
came
to
my
senses
again
i
was
in
the
hospital
wrapped
in
bandages
i
had
been
terribly
burned
see
she
loosened
her
black
gown
at
the
throat
and
pushed
it
down
over
her
right
shoulder
ralph
shuddered
at
the
deep
flaming
scars
my
arm
is
worse
she
said
quickly
covering
her
shoulder
again
i
need
not
show
you
that
my
face
was
burned
too
but
scarcely
at
all
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
how
i
escaped
i
must
have
thrown
up
my
arm
instinctively
to
shield
my
face
see
there
are
no
scars
i
see
murmured
ralph
and
what
of
him
the
dark
eyes
gleamed
indescribably
what
of
him
she
asked
with
assumed
lightness
why
he
was
not
hurt
at
all
i
saved
him
from
disfigurement
if
not
from
death
i
bear
the
scars
he
goes
free
i
know
said
ralph
but
why
were
you
not
married
all
his
life
and
love
would
be
little
enough
to
give
in
return
for
that
miss
evelina
fixed
her
deep
eyes
upon
anthony
dexter
son
in
her
voice
there
was
no
hint
of
faltering
i
never
saw
him
again
she
said
until
years
afterward
and
then
i
was
veiled
he
went
away
went
away
repeated
ralph
incredulously
miss
evelina
what
do
you
mean
what
i
said
she
replied
he
went
away
he
came
once
to
the
hospital
as
it
happened
there
was
another
girl
there
named
evelyn
grey
burned
by
acid
and
infinitely
worse
than
i
the
two
names
became
confused
he
was
told
that
i
would
be
disfigured
for
life
that
every
feature
was
destroyed
except
my
sight
that
was
enough
for
him
he
asked
no
more
questions
but
simply
went
away
coward
cried
ralph
his
face
white
cur
miss
evelina
eyes
gleamed
with
subtle
triumph
what
would
you
she
asked
unemotionally
he
told
me
that
day
of
the
accident
that
it
was
my
soul
he
loved
and
not
my
body
but
at
the
test
he
failed
men
usually
fail
women
do
they
not
in
anything
that
puts
their
love
to
the
test
he
went
away
in
a
year
he
was
married
and
he
has
a
son
a
son
repeated
ralph
what
a
heritage
of
disgrace
for
a
son
does
the
boy
know
there
was
a
significant
silence
i
do
not
think
his
father
has
told
him
said
evelina
with
forced
calmness
if
he
had
muttered
ralph
his
hands
clenched
and
his
teeth
set
his
son
must
have
struck
him
dead
where
he
stood
to
accept
that
from
a
woman
and
then
to
go
away
what
would
you
asked
evelina
again
a
curious
tigerish
impulse
was
taking
definite
shape
in
her
would
you
have
him
marry
her
marry
her
a
thousand
times
yes
if
she
would
stoop
so
low
what
man
is
worthy
of
a
woman
who
saves
his
life
at
the
risk
of
her
own
disfigured
asked
evelina
in
an
odd
voice
yes
cried
ralph
with
the
scars
she
bore
for
him
there
was
a
tense
painful
interval
miss
evelina
was
grappling
with
a
hideous
temptation
one
word
from
her
and
she
was
revenged
upon
anthony
dexter
for
all
the
years
of
suffering
one
word
from
her
and
sure
payment
would
be
made
in
the
most
subtle
terrible
way
she
guessed
that
he
could
not
bear
the
condemnation
of
this
idolised
son
the
old
pain
gnawed
at
her
heart
anthony
dexter
had
come
back
she
had
had
her
little
hour
of
triumph
and
still
she
had
not
been
freed
the
piper
had
told
her
that
only
forgiveness
could
loosen
her
chains
and
how
could
anthony
dexter
be
forgiven
when
even
his
son
said
that
he
was
a
coward
and
a
cur
i
miss
evelina
lips
moved
then
became
still
and
so
said
ralph
you
have
gone
veiled
ever
since
for
the
sake
of
that
beast
no
it
was
for
my
own
sake
do
you
wonder
that
i
have
done
it
when
i
first
realised
what
had
happened
in
an
awful
night
that
turned
my
brown
hair
white
i
knew
that
love
and
i
were
strangers
forevermore
when
i
left
the
hospital
i
was
obliged
for
a
time
to
wear
it
the
new
skin
was
tender
and
bright
red
it
broke
very
easily
i
know
nodded
ralph
there
were
oils
to
be
kept
upon
it
too
and
so
i
wore
the
veil
i
became
accustomed
to
the
shelter
of
it
i
could
walk
the
streets
and
see
dimly
without
being
seen
in
those
days
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
might
meet
him
i
do
wonder
you
shrank
from
it
returned
ralph
his
voice
was
almost
inaudible
it
became
harder
still
to
put
it
by
my
heart
was
broken
and
it
shielded
me
as
a
long
black
veil
shields
a
widow
it
protected
me
from
curious
questions
never
but
once
or
twice
in
all
the
years
have
i
been
asked
about
it
and
then
i
simply
did
not
answer
people
after
all
are
very
kind
were
you
never
ill
never
though
every
night
of
my
life
i
have
prayed
for
death
at
first
i
clung
to
it
without
reason
except
what
i
have
told
you
then
later
on
i
began
to
see
a
further
protection
veiled
as
i
was
no
man
would
ever
love
me
again
i
should
never
be
tempted
to
trust
only
to
be
betrayed
not
that
i
ever
could
trust
you
understand
but
still
sometimes
concluded
miss
evelina
piteously
i
think
the
heart
of
a
woman
is
strangely
hungry
for
love
i
understand
said
ralph
and
believe
me
i
do
not
blame
you
perhaps
it
was
the
best
thing
you
could
do
let
me
ask
you
of
the
man
you
said
i
think
that
he
still
lives
yes
miss
evelina
voice
was
very
low
he
is
well
and
happy
prosperous
yes
do
you
know
where
he
lives
yes
has
he
ever
suffered
at
all
from
his
cowardice
his
shirking
how
should
i
know
then
miss
evelina
said
ralph
his
voice
thick
with
passion
and
his
hands
tightly
clenched
will
you
let
me
go
to
him
for
the
honour
of
men
i
should
like
to
punish
this
one
brute
i
think
i
could
present
an
argument
that
even
he
might
understand
the
temptation
became
insistent
the
sheathed
dagger
was
in
hands
she
had
only
to
draw
forth
the
glittering
steel
a
vengeance
more
subtle
than
she
had
ever
dared
to
dream
of
was
hers
to
command
tell
me
his
name
breathed
ralph
only
tell
me
his
name
miss
evelina
threw
back
her
beautiful
head
proudly
no
she
said
firmly
i
will
not
go
she
cried
pointing
uncertainly
to
the
door
for
the
love
of
god
go
xxi
the
poppies
claim
their
own
it
was
dusk
and
anthony
dexter
sat
in
the
library
through
the
day
he
had
wearied
himself
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
but
his
phantom
pursuer
had
not
tired
the
veiled
figure
of
evelina
had
kept
pace
easily
with
his
quick
nervous
stride
at
the
point
on
the
river
road
where
he
had
met
her
for
the
first
time
she
had
indeed
seemed
to
go
ahead
of
him
and
wait
for
him
there
night
brought
no
relief
by
a
singular
fatality
he
could
see
her
in
darkness
as
plainly
as
in
sunshine
and
even
when
his
eyes
were
closed
she
hovered
persistently
before
him
throughout
his
drugged
sleep
she
moved
continuously
he
never
dreamed
save
of
her
in
days
gone
by
he
had
been
certain
that
he
was
the
victim
of
an
hallucination
but
now
he
was
not
so
sure
he
would
not
have
sworn
that
the
living
evelina
was
not
eternally
in
his
sight
time
and
time
again
he
had
darted
forward
quickly
to
catch
her
but
she
swiftly
eluded
him
if
he
thought
gritting
his
teeth
i
could
once
get
my
hands
upon
her
his
fists
dosed
tightly
then
by
a
supreme
effort
of
will
he
put
the
maddening
thought
away
i
will
not
add
murder
to
my
sins
he
muttered
no
by
heaven
i
will
not
by
a
whimsical
change
of
his
thought
he
conceived
himself
dead
and
in
his
coffin
would
evelina
pace
ceaselessly
before
him
then
when
he
was
in
his
grave
would
she
wait
eternally
at
the
foot
of
it
and
would
those
burning
eyes
pierce
the
shielding
sod
that
parted
them
life
had
not
served
to
separate
them
could
he
hope
that
death
would
prove
potent
where
life
had
failed
ralph
came
in
tired
having
done
his
father
work
for
the
day
the
room
was
wholly
dark
but
he
paused
upon
the
threshold
conscious
that
some
one
was
there
alone
father
he
called
cheerily
no
returned
anthony
dexter
grimly
who
here
asked
ralph
stumbling
into
the
room
it
so
dark
i
ca
see
fumbling
for
a
match
he
lighted
a
wax
candle
which
stood
in
an
antique
candlestick
on
the
library
table
the
face
of
his
father
materialised
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
wearing
an
expression
which
made
ralph
uneasy
i
thought
he
said
troubled
that
some
one
was
with
you
are
you
here
asked
anthony
dexter
trying
to
make
his
voice
even
oh
returned
ralph
i
see
with
the
candle
flickering
uncertainly
between
them
the
two
men
faced
each
other
sharp
shadows
lay
on
the
floor
and
anthony
dexter
profile
was
silhouetted
upon
the
opposite
wall
he
noted
that
the
figure
of
evelina
pacing
to
and
fro
cast
no
shadow
it
seemed
strange
in
the
endeavour
to
find
some
interesting
subject
upon
which
to
talk
ralph
chanced
upon
the
fatal
one
father
he
began
you
know
that
this
morning
we
were
speaking
of
miss
evelina
the
tone
was
inquiring
but
there
was
no
audible
answer
well
continued
ralph
i
saw
her
again
and
i
saw
her
face
he
had
forgotten
that
his
father
had
seen
it
also
and
had
told
him
only
yesterday
anthony
dexter
almost
leaped
from
his
chair
toward
the
veiled
figure
now
approaching
him
did
did
she
show
you
her
face
he
asked
with
difficulty
no
it
was
an
accident
she
often
left
the
front
door
open
for
me
when
i
was
attending
araminta
and
so
when
i
found
it
open
i
went
in
she
was
asleep
on
the
couch
in
the
parlour
and
she
wore
no
veil
at
once
the
phantom
evelina
changed
her
tactics
hitherto
she
had
walked
back
and
forth
from
side
to
side
of
his
vision
now
she
advanced
slowly
toward
him
and
as
slowly
retreated
her
face
was
no
longer
averted
she
walked
backward
cautiously
then
advanced
from
behind
her
veil
he
could
feel
her
burning
accusing
eyes
father
said
ralph
she
is
beautiful
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
have
ever
seen
in
all
my
life
her
face
is
as
exquisite
as
if
chiselled
in
marble
and
you
never
saw
such
eyes
and
she
wears
that
veil
all
the
time
anthony
dexter
cold
fingers
were
forced
to
drum
on
the
table
with
apparent
carelessness
yes
he
knew
she
was
beautiful
he
had
not
forgotten
it
for
an
instant
since
she
had
thrown
back
her
veil
and
faced
him
did
did
she
tell
you
why
he
asked
yes
answered
ralph
she
told
me
why
a
sword
suspended
by
a
single
hair
seemed
swaying
uncertainly
over
anthony
dexter
head
a
sword
sure
to
strike
mercilessly
if
it
fell
ralph
eyes
were
upon
him
but
not
in
contempt
god
in
his
infinite
pity
had
made
them
kind
father
said
ralph
again
she
would
not
tell
the
name
of
the
man
though
i
begged
her
to
anthony
dexter
heart
began
to
beat
again
slowly
at
first
then
with
a
sudden
and
unbearable
swiftness
the
blood
thundered
in
his
ears
like
the
roar
of
a
cataract
he
could
hardly
hear
what
ralph
was
saying
it
was
in
a
laboratory
the
boy
continued
though
the
words
were
almost
lost
she
was
there
with
the
man
she
loved
and
whom
she
was
pledged
to
marry
he
was
trying
a
new
experiment
and
she
was
watching
while
he
was
leaning
over
the
retort
to
put
in
another
chemical
she
heard
the
mass
seethe
and
pushed
him
away
just
in
time
to
save
him
there
was
an
explosion
and
she
was
terribly
burned
he
was
not
touched
mind
you
she
had
saved
him
they
took
her
to
the
hospital
and
wrapped
her
in
bandages
he
went
there
only
once
there
was
another
girl
there
named
evelyn
grey
who
was
so
badly
burned
that
every
feature
was
destroyed
the
two
names
became
confused
and
a
mistake
was
made
they
told
him
she
would
be
disfigured
for
life
and
so
he
went
away
the
walls
of
the
room
swayed
as
though
they
were
of
fabric
the
floor
undulated
his
chair
rocked
dizzily
out
of
the
accusing
silence
thorpe
words
leaped
to
mock
him
honour
of
the
spoken
word
still
holds
him
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
she
consented
he
was
never
released
from
his
promise
did
not
even
ask
for
it
he
slunk
away
like
a
cur
sometimes
i
think
there
is
no
sin
but
shirking
i
can
excuse
a
liar
i
can
pardon
a
thief
i
can
pity
a
murderer
but
a
shirk
father
ralph
was
saying
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
i
suppose
it
is
difficult
for
you
to
comprehend
such
cowardice
you
have
always
done
the
square
thing
the
man
winced
but
the
boy
did
not
see
it
try
to
think
of
a
brute
like
that
father
and
be
glad
that
our
name
means
she
saved
him
from
terrible
disfigurement
if
not
from
death
having
instinctively
thrown
up
her
right
arm
she
got
the
worst
of
it
there
and
on
her
shoulder
her
face
was
badly
burned
but
not
so
deeply
as
to
be
scarred
she
showed
me
her
shoulder
it
is
awful
i
never
had
seen
anything
like
it
she
said
her
arm
was
worse
but
she
did
not
show
me
that
he
never
knew
asked
anthony
dexter
huskily
ralph
seemed
to
be
demanding
something
of
him
and
the
veiled
figure
steadily
advancing
and
retreating
demanded
more
still
no
answered
ralph
he
never
knew
he
went
to
the
hospital
only
once
he
had
told
her
that
very
day
that
he
loved
her
for
the
beautiful
soul
she
had
and
at
the
test
his
love
failed
he
never
saw
her
again
he
went
away
and
married
and
he
has
a
son
think
of
the
son
father
only
think
of
the
son
suppose
he
knew
it
how
could
he
ever
bear
a
disgrace
like
that
i
do
not
know
muttered
anthony
dexter
his
lips
were
cold
and
stiff
and
he
did
not
recognise
his
own
voice
when
she
understood
what
had
happened
ralph
continued
and
how
he
had
deserted
her
for
ever
after
taking
his
cowardly
life
from
her
as
a
gift
her
hair
turned
white
she
has
wonderful
hair
father
heavy
and
white
and
dull
it
does
not
shine
she
wore
the
veil
at
first
because
she
had
to
because
her
face
was
healing
and
before
it
had
wholly
healed
she
had
become
accustomed
to
the
shelter
of
it
then
too
as
she
said
it
kept
people
away
from
her
she
could
not
be
tempted
to
love
or
trust
again
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
though
the
very
walls
seemed
to
be
crying
out
tell
him
tell
him
confess
and
purge
your
guilty
soul
the
clock
ticked
loudly
the
blood
roared
in
his
ears
his
hands
were
cold
and
almost
lifeless
his
body
seemed
paralysed
but
he
heard
so
acutely
that
it
was
agony
miss
evelina
said
resumed
ralph
that
she
did
not
think
he
had
told
his
son
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
father
while
she
was
talking
i
was
thinking
of
you
and
how
you
had
always
done
the
square
thing
it
seemed
to
anthony
dexter
that
all
the
tortures
of
his
laboratory
had
been
chemically
concentrated
and
were
being
poured
out
upon
his
head
our
name
means
said
the
boy
proudly
and
the
man
writhed
in
his
chair
for
a
moment
the
ghostly
evelina
went
to
ralph
her
hands
outstretched
in
disapproval
immediately
she
returned
to
her
former
position
advancing
retreating
advancing
retreating
with
the
regularity
of
the
tide
i
begged
her
continued
ralph
to
tell
me
the
man
name
but
she
would
not
he
still
lives
she
said
he
is
happy
and
prosperous
and
he
has
not
suffered
at
all
for
the
honour
of
men
i
want
to
punish
that
brute
father
do
you
know
that
when
i
think
of
a
cur
like
that
i
believe
i
could
rend
him
with
my
own
hands
anthony
dexter
got
to
his
feet
unsteadily
the
mists
about
him
cleared
and
the
veiled
figure
whisked
suddenly
out
of
his
sight
he
went
up
to
ralph
as
he
might
walk
to
the
scaffold
but
his
head
was
held
high
all
the
anguish
of
his
soul
crystallised
itself
into
one
passionate
word
strike
for
an
instant
the
boy
faced
him
unbelieving
then
he
remembered
that
his
father
had
seen
miss
evelina
face
that
he
must
have
known
she
was
beautiful
and
why
she
wore
the
veil
father
he
cried
shrilly
oh
never
you
anthony
dexter
looked
into
the
eyes
of
his
son
until
he
could
bear
to
look
no
more
the
veiled
figure
no
longer
stood
between
them
but
something
else
was
there
infinitely
more
terrible
as
he
had
watched
the
beating
of
the
dog
bared
heart
the
man
watched
the
boy
face
incredulity
amazement
wonder
and
fear
resolved
themselves
gradually
into
conviction
then
came
contempt
so
deep
and
profound
and
permanent
that
from
it
there
could
never
be
appeal
with
all
the
strength
of
his
young
and
knightly
soul
ralph
despised
his
father
and
anthony
dexter
knew
it
father
whispered
the
boy
hoarsely
it
was
never
you
tell
me
it
is
true
just
a
word
and
i
believe
you
for
the
sake
of
our
manhood
father
tell
me
it
is
true
anthony
dexter
head
drooped
his
eyes
lowered
before
his
son
the
cold
sweat
dripped
from
his
face
his
hands
groped
pitifully
like
those
of
a
blind
man
feeling
his
way
in
a
strange
place
his
hands
fumbled
helplessly
toward
ralph
and
the
boy
shrank
back
as
though
from
the
touch
of
a
snake
with
a
breath
of
agony
the
man
flung
himself
unseeing
out
of
the
room
ralph
reeled
like
a
drunken
man
against
his
chair
he
sank
into
it
helplessly
and
his
head
fell
forward
on
the
table
his
shoulders
shaking
with
that
awful
grief
which
knows
no
tears
father
he
breathed
father
father
upstairs
anthony
dexter
walked
through
the
hall
followed
or
occasionally
preceded
by
the
ghostly
figure
of
evelina
her
veil
was
thrown
back
now
and
seemed
a
part
of
the
mist
which
surrounded
her
sometimes
he
had
told
a
patient
that
there
was
never
a
point
beyond
which
human
endurance
could
not
be
made
to
go
he
knew
now
that
he
had
lied
ralph
unspoken
condemnation
had
hurt
him
cruelly
he
could
have
borne
words
he
thought
better
than
that
look
on
his
son
face
for
the
first
time
he
realised
how
much
he
had
cared
for
ralph
how
much
god
help
him
he
cared
for
him
still
yet
above
it
all
dominant
compelling
was
man
supreme
passion
that
for
his
mate
as
evelina
moved
before
him
in
her
unveiled
beauty
his
hungry
soul
leaped
to
meet
hers
now
strangely
he
loved
her
as
he
had
loved
her
in
the
long
ago
yet
with
an
added
grace
there
was
an
element
in
his
love
that
had
never
been
there
before
the
mysterious
bond
which
welds
more
firmly
into
one
two
who
have
suffered
together
he
hungered
for
ralph
for
the
strong
young
arm
thrown
about
his
shoulders
in
friendly
fashion
for
the
eager
boyish
laugh
the
hearty
word
he
hungered
for
evelina
radiant
with
a
beauty
no
woman
had
ever
worn
before
far
past
the
promise
of
her
girlhood
the
noble
transfigured
face
with
its
glory
of
lustreless
white
hair
set
his
pulses
to
throbbing
wildly
and
subtly
unconsciously
but
not
the
less
surely
he
hungered
for
death
anthony
dexter
had
cherished
no
sentiment
about
the
end
of
life
to
him
it
had
seemed
much
the
same
as
the
stopping
of
a
clock
and
of
as
little
moment
he
had
failed
to
see
why
such
a
fuss
was
made
about
the
inevitable
though
he
had
at
times
been
scientifically
interested
in
the
hysterical
effect
he
had
produced
in
a
household
by
announcing
that
within
an
hour
or
so
a
particular
human
clock
might
be
expected
to
stop
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
either
that
a
man
had
not
a
right
to
stop
the
clock
of
his
own
being
whenever
it
seemed
desirable
or
expedient
now
he
thought
of
death
as
the
final
beautiful
solution
of
all
mundane
problems
if
he
were
dead
ralph
could
not
look
at
him
with
contempt
the
veiled
or
unveiled
evelina
could
not
haunt
him
as
she
had
remorselessly
for
months
yes
death
was
beautiful
and
he
well
knew
how
to
make
it
sure
by
an
incredibly
swift
transition
his
pain
passed
into
an
exquisite
pleasure
the
woman
he
loved
was
walking
in
the
hall
before
him
the
son
he
loved
was
downstairs
what
man
could
have
more
for
sudden
the
worst
turns
the
best
to
the
brave
the
black
minute
at
end
and
the
elements
rage
the
fiend
voices
that
rave
shall
dwindle
shall
blend
shall
change
shall
become
first
a
peace
out
of
pain
then
a
light
then
thy
breast
oh
thou
soul
of
my
soul
i
shall
clasp
thee
again
and
with
god
be
the
rest
the
wonderful
words
sang
themselves
over
in
his
consciousness
he
smiled
and
the
unveiled
evelina
smiled
back
at
him
with
infinite
tenderness
infinite
love
he
would
sleep
as
he
had
not
slept
before
in
the
sleep
that
knows
no
waking
he
had
the
tiny
white
tablets
plenty
of
them
but
the
fancy
seized
him
to
taste
this
last
bitterness
to
the
full
he
took
a
wine
glass
from
his
chiffonier
those
white
blunt
fingers
had
never
been
more
steady
than
now
he
lifted
the
vial
on
high
and
poured
out
the
laudanum
faltering
no
more
than
when
he
had
guided
the
knife
in
an
operation
that
made
him
famous
throughout
the
state
evelina
he
said
his
voice
curiously
soft
i
pledge
you
now
in
a
bond
that
can
not
break
was
it
fancy
or
did
the
violet
eyes
soften
with
tears
even
though
the
scarlet
lips
smiled
he
drank
the
silken
petals
of
the
poppies
crushed
into
the
peace
that
passeth
all
understanding
began
their
gentle
ministry
he
made
his
way
to
his
bed
put
out
his
candle
and
lay
down
the
spirit
of
the
poppies
stood
before
him
a
woman
with
a
face
like
evelina
but
her
garments
were
scarlet
and
evelina
always
wore
black
in
the
darkness
he
could
not
distinguish
clearly
evelina
he
called
aloud
come
come
to
me
and
put
your
hand
in
mine
at
once
she
seemed
to
answer
him
wholly
tender
wholly
kind
was
he
dreaming
or
did
evelina
come
and
kneel
beside
him
he
groped
for
her
hand
but
it
eluded
him
evelina
he
said
again
dear
heart
come
forgive
he
breathed
drowsily
ah
only
forgive
then
as
if
by
a
miracle
her
hand
slipped
into
his
and
he
felt
his
head
drawn
tenderly
to
man
first
and
last
resting
place
a
breast
and
so
after
a
little
anthony
dexter
slept
the
spirit
of
the
poppies
had
claimed
her
own
at
last
xxii
forgiveness
haggard
and
worn
after
a
sleepless
night
ralph
went
heavily
upon
his
young
shoulders
he
bore
the
burden
of
his
disgrace
through
their
kinship
the
cowardice
and
the
shirking
became
a
part
of
his
heritage
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
he
could
not
raise
his
hand
in
anger
against
his
own
father
they
must
continue
to
live
together
and
keep
an
unbroken
front
to
the
world
even
though
the
bond
between
them
had
come
to
be
the
merest
pretence
he
despised
his
father
but
no
one
must
ever
know
it
not
even
the
father
whom
he
despised
ralph
did
not
guess
that
his
father
had
read
his
face
he
saw
now
why
miss
evelina
had
refused
to
tell
him
the
man
name
and
he
honoured
her
for
her
reticence
he
perceived
too
the
hideous
temptation
with
which
she
was
grappling
when
she
begged
him
to
leave
her
she
had
feared
that
she
would
tell
him
and
he
must
never
let
her
suspect
that
he
knew
the
mighty
unseen
forces
that
lie
beneath
our
daily
living
were
surging
through
ralph
troubled
soul
love
hatred
shame
remorse
anger
despair
the
words
are
but
symbols
of
things
that
work
devastation
within
behold
a
man
in
all
outward
seeming
a
gentleman
observe
his
courtesy
refinement
and
consideration
his
perfect
note
his
mastery
of
the
lower
nature
and
see
the
mind
in
complete
triumph
over
the
beast
remark
his
education
the
luxury
of
his
surroundings
and
the
fine
quality
of
his
thought
wonder
at
the
high
levels
whereon
his
life
is
laid
and
marvel
at
the
perfect
adjustment
between
him
and
his
circumstances
subject
this
man
to
the
onslaught
of
some
vast
cyclonic
passion
and
see
the
barriers
crumble
then
fall
see
all
the
artifice
of
civilisation
swept
away
at
one
fell
stroke
and
behold
your
gentleman
transformed
in
an
instant
into
a
beast
with
all
a
beast
primeval
qualities
under
stress
like
this
ralph
was
fighting
to
regain
his
self
mastery
he
knew
that
he
must
force
himself
to
sit
opposite
his
father
at
the
table
and
exchange
the
daily
commonplace
talk
no
one
must
ever
suspect
that
anything
was
amiss
it
is
this
demand
of
society
which
keeps
the
structure
in
place
and
draws
the
line
between
civilisation
and
barbarism
he
knew
that
he
never
again
could
look
his
father
straight
in
the
face
that
he
must
always
avoid
his
eyes
it
would
be
hard
at
first
but
ralph
had
never
given
up
anything
simply
because
it
was
difficult
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
he
was
downstairs
first
hearing
his
father
step
upon
the
stair
he
thought
would
enable
him
to
steel
himself
more
surely
to
the
inevitable
meeting
after
they
had
once
spoken
together
it
would
be
easier
at
length
they
might
even
become
accustomed
to
the
ghastly
thing
that
lay
between
them
and
veil
it
as
it
were
with
commonplaces
ralph
took
up
the
morning
paper
and
pretended
to
read
though
the
words
danced
all
over
the
page
the
old
housekeeper
brought
in
his
breakfast
and
likewise
he
affected
to
eat
an
hour
went
by
and
still
the
dreaded
step
did
not
sound
upon
the
stair
at
length
the
old
housekeeper
said
with
a
certain
timid
deference
your
father
very
late
this
morning
doctor
ralph
he
has
never
been
so
late
before
he
be
down
presently
he
probably
overslept
it
not
your
father
way
to
oversleep
had
you
better
go
up
and
see
thus
forced
ralph
went
leisurely
intending
only
to
rap
upon
the
door
which
was
always
closed
perhaps
with
the
closed
door
between
them
the
first
speech
might
be
easier
he
rapped
once
with
hesitation
then
again
more
definitely
there
was
no
answer
wholly
without
suspicion
ralph
opened
the
door
and
went
in
anthony
dexter
lay
upon
his
bed
fully
dressed
on
his
face
was
a
smile
of
ineffable
peace
ralph
went
to
him
quickly
shook
him
and
felt
his
pulse
but
vainly
the
heart
of
the
man
made
no
answer
to
the
questioning
fingers
of
his
son
the
eyes
were
closed
and
his
hands
trembling
now
ralph
forced
them
open
the
contracted
pupils
gave
him
all
the
information
he
needed
he
found
the
wineglass
which
still
smelled
of
laudanum
he
washed
it
carefully
put
it
away
then
went
his
first
sensation
was
entirely
relief
anthony
dexter
had
chosen
the
one
sure
way
out
ralph
had
a
distinct
sense
of
gratitude
until
he
remembered
that
death
did
not
end
disgrace
never
again
need
he
look
in
his
father
eyes
there
was
no
imperative
demand
that
he
should
conceal
his
contempt
with
the
hiding
of
anthony
dexter
body
beneath
the
shriving
sod
all
would
be
over
save
memory
could
he
put
by
this
memory
as
his
father
had
his
ralph
did
not
know
the
sorrowful
preliminaries
were
all
over
before
ralph
feeling
was
in
any
way
changed
then
the
pity
of
it
all
overwhelmed
him
in
a
blinding
flood
searching
for
something
or
some
one
to
lean
upon
his
thought
turned
to
miss
evelina
surely
now
he
might
go
to
her
if
comfort
was
to
be
had
of
any
sort
he
could
find
it
there
at
any
rate
they
were
bound
much
as
his
father
had
been
bound
to
her
before
by
the
logic
of
events
he
went
uphill
scarcely
knowing
how
he
made
his
way
miss
evelina
veiled
as
usual
opened
the
door
for
him
ralph
stumbled
across
the
threshold
crying
out
my
father
is
dead
he
died
by
his
own
hand
yes
returned
miss
evelina
quietly
i
have
heard
i
am
sorry
for
you
you
need
not
be
flashed
ralph
quickly
it
is
for
us
my
father
and
i
to
be
sorry
for
you
to
make
amends
if
any
amends
can
be
made
by
the
living
or
the
dead
miss
evelina
started
he
knew
then
and
it
had
not
been
necessary
for
her
to
draw
out
the
sheathed
dagger
which
only
yesterday
she
had
held
in
her
hand
the
glittering
vengeance
had
gone
home
through
no
direct
agency
of
hers
miss
evelina
cried
the
boy
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
forgive
my
father
a
silence
fell
between
them
as
cold
and
forbidding
as
death
itself
after
an
interval
which
seemed
an
hour
miss
evelina
spoke
he
never
asked
she
said
her
tone
was
icy
repellent
i
know
answered
ralph
despairingly
but
i
his
son
ask
it
anthony
dexter
son
asks
you
to
forgive
anthony
dexter
not
to
let
him
go
to
his
grave
unforgiven
he
never
asked
said
miss
evelina
again
stubbornly
his
need
is
all
the
greater
for
that
pleaded
the
boy
and
mine
have
you
thought
of
my
need
of
it
my
name
meant
until
my
father
changed
its
meaning
do
you
see
that
unless
you
forgive
my
father
i
can
never
hold
up
my
head
again
what
the
piper
had
said
to
evelina
came
back
to
her
now
eloquent
with
appeal
word
is
not
made
right
i
thinking
is
wrong
end
to
as
many
things
in
this
world
are
until
we
move
and
look
at
them
from
another
way
it
giving
for
that
all
when
you
have
put
self
so
wholly
aside
that
you
can
he
sorry
for
him
because
he
has
wronged
you
why
then
you
have
she
moved
about
restlessly
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
never
be
sorry
for
anthony
dexter
because
he
had
wronged
her
that
she
could
never
grow
out
of
the
hurt
of
her
own
wrong
come
with
me
said
ralph
choking
i
know
it
a
hard
thing
i
ask
of
you
god
knows
i
have
forgiven
him
myself
but
i
know
i
got
to
and
you
have
to
too
miss
evelina
you
got
to
forgive
him
or
i
never
can
bear
my
disgrace
she
let
him
lead
her
out
of
the
house
on
the
long
way
to
anthony
dexter
no
word
passed
between
them
only
the
sound
of
their
footfalls
and
ralph
long
choking
breaths
half
sobs
broke
the
silence
at
the
gate
the
usual
knot
of
curious
people
had
gathered
they
were
wondering
in
undertones
how
one
so
skilful
as
doctor
dexter
had
happened
to
take
an
overdose
of
laudanum
but
they
stood
by
respectfully
to
make
way
for
ralph
and
the
mysterious
veiled
woman
in
black
the
audible
whispers
followed
them
up
to
the
very
door
who
is
she
what
had
she
to
do
with
him
as
yet
anthony
dexter
body
lay
in
his
own
room
ralph
led
miss
evelina
in
and
closed
the
door
here
he
is
sobbed
the
boy
he
has
gone
and
left
the
shame
for
me
forgive
him
miss
evelina
for
the
love
of
god
forgive
him
evelina
sighed
she
was
standing
close
to
anthony
dexter
now
without
fear
she
had
no
wish
to
torture
him
as
she
once
had
with
the
sight
of
her
unveiled
face
it
was
the
man
she
had
loved
now
the
emotion
which
had
made
him
hideous
to
her
was
past
and
gone
to
her
as
to
him
the
night
before
death
seemed
the
solution
of
all
problems
the
supreme
answer
to
all
perplexing
questions
ralph
crept
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
so
softly
that
she
did
not
hear
she
was
alone
as
every
woman
some
day
is
alone
with
her
dead
she
threw
back
her
veil
the
morning
sun
lay
strong
upon
anthony
dexter
face
revealing
every
line
death
had
been
kind
to
him
at
last
had
closed
the
tortured
eyes
blotted
out
the
lines
of
cruelty
around
his
mouth
and
changed
the
expression
to
a
tender
calm
a
hint
of
the
old
loving
smile
was
there
once
again
he
was
the
man
she
had
loved
but
the
love
itself
had
burned
out
of
her
heart
long
ago
he
was
naught
to
her
nor
she
to
him
the
door
knob
turned
and
quickly
she
lowered
her
veil
piper
tom
came
in
with
a
soft
slow
step
he
did
not
seem
to
see
miss
evelina
one
would
have
said
he
did
not
know
she
was
in
the
room
he
went
straight
to
anthony
dexter
and
laid
his
warm
hand
upon
the
cold
one
man
he
said
i
come
to
say
i
forgive
you
for
hurting
laddie
i
not
thinking
now
that
you
would
have
done
it
if
you
had
known
i
sorry
for
you
because
you
could
do
it
i
forgiven
you
as
i
hope
god
will
forgive
you
for
that
and
for
everything
else
then
he
turned
to
evelina
and
whispered
as
though
to
keep
the
dead
from
hearing
was
hard
but
i
done
it
is
easier
thinking
to
forgive
the
dead
than
the
living
he
went
out
again
as
silently
as
he
had
come
and
closed
the
door
was
it
in
truth
easier
to
forgive
the
dead
in
her
inmost
soul
evelina
knew
that
she
could
not
have
cherished
lifelong
resentment
against
any
other
person
in
the
world
to
those
we
love
most
we
are
invariably
most
cruel
but
she
did
not
love
him
now
the
man
she
had
loved
was
no
more
than
a
stranger
and
from
a
stranger
can
come
no
intentional
wrong
o
god
prayed
evelina
for
the
first
time
help
me
to
forgive
she
threw
back
her
veil
once
more
they
were
face
to
face
at
last
with
only
a
prayer
between
his
mute
helplessness
pleaded
with
her
and
ralph
despairing
cry
rang
in
her
ears
the
estranging
mists
cleared
and
in
truth
she
put
self
aside
intuitively
she
saw
how
he
had
suffered
since
the
night
he
came
to
her
to
make
it
right
if
he
could
he
must
have
suffered
unless
he
were
more
than
human
dear
god
she
prayed
again
oh
help
me
forgive
all
at
once
there
was
a
change
the
light
seemed
thrown
into
the
uttermost
places
of
her
darkened
soul
she
illumined
and
a
wave
of
infinite
pity
swept
her
from
head
to
foot
she
leaned
forward
her
hands
seeking
his
and
upon
anthony
dexter
dead
face
there
fell
the
forgiving
baptism
of
her
tears
in
the
hall
as
she
went
out
she
encountered
miss
mehitable
that
face
too
was
changed
she
had
not
come
as
comes
that
ghoulish
procession
of
merest
acquaintances
to
gloat
living
over
the
helpless
dead
at
the
sight
of
evelina
she
retreated
i
go
back
murmured
miss
mehitable
enigmatically
you
had
the
best
right
evelina
went
and
home
again
but
miss
mehitable
did
not
enter
that
silent
room
the
third
day
came
and
there
was
no
resurrection
since
the
miracle
of
easter
the
world
has
waited
its
three
days
for
the
dead
to
rise
again
ralph
sat
in
the
upper
hall
just
beyond
the
turn
of
the
stair
and
beside
him
unveiled
was
miss
evelina
it
you
and
i
he
had
pleaded
do
you
see
that
have
you
never
thought
that
you
should
have
been
my
mother
from
below
in
thorpe
deep
voice
came
the
words
of
the
burial
service
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
on
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
for
a
few
moments
thorpe
spoke
of
death
as
the
inevitable
end
of
life
and
our
ignorance
of
what
lies
beyond
he
spoke
of
that
mystic
veil
which
never
parts
save
for
a
passage
and
from
behind
which
no
word
ever
comes
he
said
that
life
was
a
rainbow
spanning
brilliantly
the
two
silences
that
man
ceasing
was
no
more
strange
than
his
beginning
and
that
the
god
who
ordained
the
beginning
had
also
ordained
the
end
he
said
too
that
the
love
which
gave
life
might
safely
be
trusted
with
that
same
life
at
its
mysterious
conclusion
at
length
he
struck
the
personal
note
it
is
hard
for
me
thorpe
went
on
to
perform
this
last
service
for
my
friend
all
of
you
are
my
friends
but
the
one
who
lies
here
was
especially
dear
he
was
a
man
of
few
friendships
and
i
was
privileged
to
come
close
to
know
him
as
he
was
his
life
was
clean
and
upon
his
record
there
rests
no
shadow
of
disgrace
at
this
ralph
in
the
upper
hall
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
miss
evelina
sat
quietly
to
all
intents
and
purposes
unmoved
he
was
a
brave
man
thorpe
was
saying
a
valiant
soldier
on
the
great
battlefield
of
the
world
he
met
his
temptations
face
to
face
and
conquered
them
for
him
there
was
no
such
thing
as
cowardice
he
never
shirked
he
met
every
responsibility
like
a
man
and
never
swerved
aside
he
took
his
share
and
more
of
the
world
work
and
did
it
nobly
as
a
man
should
do
his
brusque
manner
concealed
a
great
heart
i
fear
that
at
times
some
of
you
may
have
misunderstood
him
there
was
no
man
in
our
community
more
deeply
and
lovingly
the
friend
of
us
all
and
there
is
no
man
among
us
more
noble
in
thought
and
act
than
he
we
who
have
known
him
can
not
but
be
the
better
for
the
knowing
it
would
be
a
beautiful
world
indeed
if
we
were
all
as
good
as
he
we
can
not
fail
to
be
inspired
by
his
example
through
knowing
him
each
of
us
is
better
fitted
for
life
we
can
conquer
cowardice
more
easily
meet
our
temptations
more
valiantly
and
more
surely
keep
from
the
sin
of
shirking
because
anthony
dexter
has
lived
to
me
said
thorpe
his
voice
breaking
it
is
the
greatest
loss
save
one
that
i
have
ever
known
but
it
is
only
through
our
own
sorrow
that
we
come
to
understand
the
sorrow
of
others
only
through
our
own
weaknesses
that
we
learn
to
pity
the
weakness
of
others
and
only
through
our
own
love
and
forgiveness
that
we
can
ever
comprehend
the
infinite
love
and
forgiveness
of
god
if
any
of
you
have
ever
thought
he
wronged
you
in
some
small
insignificant
way
i
give
you
my
word
that
it
was
entirely
unintentional
and
i
bespeak
for
him
your
pardon
he
goes
to
his
grave
to
wait
in
the
great
silence
for
the
final
solution
of
god
infinite
mysteries
and
as
you
and
i
believe
for
god
sure
reward
he
goes
with
the
love
of
us
all
with
the
forgiveness
of
us
all
and
with
the
hope
of
us
all
that
when
we
come
to
die
we
may
be
as
certain
of
heaven
as
he
perceiving
that
his
grief
was
overmastering
him
thorpe
proceeded
quickly
to
the
benediction
in
the
pause
that
followed
ralph
leaned
toward
the
woman
who
sat
beside
him
have
you
he
breathed
forgiven
him
and
me
miss
evelina
nodded
her
beautiful
eyes
shining
with
tears
mother
said
ralph
thickly
like
a
hurt
child
he
went
to
her
and
sobbed
his
heart
out
in
the
shelter
of
her
arms
xxiii
undine
finds
her
soul
the
year
was
at
its
noon
every
was
glorious
with
bloom
and
even
the
old
climbing
rose
which
clung
in
its
decay
to
miss
mehitable
porch
railing
had
put
forth
a
few
fragrant
blossoms
soon
after
araminta
had
been
carried
back
home
she
discovered
that
she
had
changed
since
she
went
away
aunt
hitty
no
longer
seemed
infallible
indeed
araminta
had
admitted
to
herself
though
with
the
pangs
of
a
guilty
conscience
that
it
was
possible
for
aunt
hitty
to
be
mistaken
it
was
probable
that
the
entire
knowledge
of
the
world
was
not
concentrated
in
aunt
hitty
outwardly
things
went
on
as
usual
miss
mehitable
issued
orders
to
araminta
as
the
commander
in
chief
of
an
army
issues
instructions
to
his
subordinates
and
araminta
obeyed
as
faithfully
as
before
yet
with
a
distinct
difference
she
did
what
she
was
told
to
do
out
of
gratitude
for
lifelong
care
and
not
because
she
felt
that
she
had
to
she
went
frequently
to
see
miss
evelina
having
disposed
of
objections
by
the
evident
fact
that
she
could
not
neglect
any
one
who
had
been
so
kind
to
her
as
miss
evelina
had
usually
however
the
faithful
guardian
went
along
and
the
three
sat
in
the
garden
evelina
with
her
frail
hands
listlessly
folded
and
the
others
stitching
away
at
the
endless
and
monotonous
patchwork
miss
mehitable
had
a
secret
fear
that
the
bloom
had
been
brushed
from
her
rose
until
the
accident
araminta
had
scarcely
been
out
of
her
sight
since
she
brought
her
home
a
toddling
infant
miss
mind
had
unerringly
controlled
two
bodies
until
araminta
fell
off
the
ladder
now
the
other
mind
began
to
show
distressing
signs
of
activity
by
dint
of
extra
work
araminta
eighth
patchwork
quilt
was
made
for
quilting
and
the
ladies
aid
society
was
invited
to
miss
for
the
usual
summer
revelry
of
quilting
and
gossip
miss
evelina
was
invited
but
refused
to
go
after
the
festivity
was
over
miss
mehitable
made
a
fruitful
excavation
into
a
huge
chest
in
the
attic
and
emerged
flushed
but
happy
with
enough
scraps
for
three
quilts
this
here
next
quilt
minty
she
said
with
the
air
of
one
announcing
a
pleasant
surprise
will
be
the
risin
sun
and
star
pattern
harder
the
others
and
that
why
i
kep
it
until
now
done
all
them
other
quilts
real
good
she
added
grudgingly
araminta
had
her
own
surprise
ready
but
it
was
not
of
a
pleasant
nature
thank
you
aunt
hitty
she
replied
but
i
not
going
to
make
any
more
quilts
for
a
while
at
any
rate
miss
mehitable
lower
jaw
dropped
in
amazement
never
before
had
araminta
failed
to
obey
her
suggestions
minty
she
said
anxiously
do
you
feel
right
it
was
hot
yesterday
and
the
excitement
and
all
i
dunno
but
you
may
have
had
a
stroke
araminta
smiled
a
lovable
winning
smile
no
i
have
had
any
but
i
made
all
the
quilts
i
going
to
until
i
get
to
be
an
old
woman
and
have
nothing
else
to
do
what
are
you
layin
out
to
do
minty
demanded
miss
mehitable
i
going
to
be
outdoors
all
i
want
to
and
i
going
up
to
miss
evelina
and
play
with
my
kitten
and
help
you
with
the
housework
or
do
anything
else
you
want
me
to
do
but
no
more
quilts
concluded
the
girl
firmly
araminta
lee
cried
miss
mehitable
speech
having
returned
if
i
ai
ashamed
of
you
here
your
poor
old
aunt
that
worked
her
fingers
to
the
bone
slaving
for
you
almost
ever
since
the
day
you
was
born
and
payin
a
doctor
outrageous
bill
of
four
dollars
and
a
half
or
goin
to
pay
she
corrected
her
conscience
reproaching
her
and
you
refusin
to
mind
have
i
took
good
care
of
you
all
these
eighteen
years
have
i
set
up
with
you
when
you
was
sick
and
never
let
you
out
of
my
sight
for
a
minute
and
taught
you
to
be
as
good
a
housekeeper
as
any
in
rushton
and
made
you
into
a
seamstress
and
educated
you
myself
and
looked
after
your
religious
training
and
made
your
clothes
i
been
father
and
mother
and
sister
and
brother
and
teacher
and
grandparents
all
rolled
into
one
and
now
you
refusin
to
make
quilts
araminta
heart
reproached
her
but
the
blood
of
some
fighting
ancestor
was
in
her
pulses
now
i
know
aunt
hitty
she
said
kindly
you
done
all
that
and
more
and
i
not
in
the
least
ungrateful
though
you
may
think
so
but
i
not
going
to
make
any
more
quilts
araminta
lee
said
miss
mehitable
warningly
look
careful
where
you
steppin
hell
is
yawning
in
front
of
you
this
very
minute
araminta
smiled
sweetly
since
the
day
the
minister
had
gone
to
see
her
she
had
had
no
fear
of
hell
i
do
see
it
aunt
hitty
she
said
but
if
everybody
who
has
pieced
more
than
eight
quilts
by
hand
is
in
there
it
must
be
pretty
crowded
araminta
lee
cried
miss
mehitable
you
your
mother
all
over
again
she
got
just
as
as
you
before
her
downfall
and
see
where
she
ended
at
she
was
married
concluded
the
accuser
scornfully
yes
actually
married
aunt
hitty
said
araminta
her
sweet
mouth
quivering
ever
so
little
your
mother
was
married
too
was
she
with
this
parting
shaft
the
girl
went
out
of
the
room
her
head
held
high
miss
mehitable
stared
after
her
uncomprehending
slowly
it
dawned
upon
her
that
some
one
had
been
telling
tales
and
undoing
her
careful
work
minty
minty
she
cried
how
can
you
talk
to
me
so
but
was
outdoors
and
on
her
way
to
miss
evelina
bareheaded
this
being
strictly
forbidden
so
she
did
not
hear
she
was
hoping
against
hope
that
some
day
at
miss
evelina
she
might
meet
doctor
ralph
again
and
tell
him
she
was
sorry
she
had
broken
his
heart
since
the
day
he
went
away
from
her
araminta
had
not
had
even
a
glimpse
of
him
she
had
gone
to
his
father
funeral
as
everyone
else
in
the
village
did
and
had
wondered
that
he
was
not
in
the
front
seat
where
in
her
brief
experience
of
funerals
mourners
usually
sat
she
admitted
to
herself
that
she
had
gone
to
the
funeral
solely
for
the
sake
of
seeing
doctor
ralph
araminta
was
wholly
destitute
of
curiosity
regarding
the
dead
and
she
had
not
joined
the
interested
procession
which
wound
itself
around
anthony
dexter
coffin
before
passing
out
regretfully
at
the
front
door
neither
had
miss
mehitable
at
the
time
araminta
had
thought
it
strange
for
at
all
previous
occasions
of
the
kind
within
her
remembrance
aunt
hitty
had
been
well
up
among
the
mourners
and
had
usually
gone
around
the
casket
twice
at
miss
evelina
she
knocked
in
vain
there
was
white
chiffon
upon
the
line
but
all
the
doors
were
locked
doctor
ralph
was
not
there
either
and
even
the
kitten
was
not
in
sight
so
regretfully
araminta
went
home
again
throughout
the
day
miss
mehitable
did
not
speak
to
her
erring
niece
but
araminta
felt
it
to
be
a
relief
rather
than
a
punishment
in
the
afternoon
the
emancipated
young
woman
put
on
her
best
gown
a
white
muslin
which
she
had
made
herself
it
was
not
sunday
and
araminta
was
forbidden
to
wear
the
glorified
raiment
save
on
occasions
of
high
state
she
added
further
to
her
sins
by
picking
a
pink
rose
miss
mehitable
did
not
think
flowers
were
made
to
pick
and
fastening
it
coquettishly
in
her
brown
hair
moreover
araminta
had
put
her
hair
up
loosely
instead
of
in
the
neat
tight
wad
which
miss
mehitable
had
forced
upon
her
the
day
she
donned
long
skirts
when
miss
mehitable
beheld
her
transformed
charge
she
would
have
broken
her
vow
of
silence
had
not
the
words
mercifully
failed
aunt
hitty
vocabulary
was
limited
and
she
had
no
language
in
which
to
express
her
full
opinion
of
the
wayward
one
so
she
assumed
instead
the
pose
of
a
suffering
martyr
the
atmosphere
at
the
table
during
supper
was
icy
even
though
it
was
the
middle
of
june
thorpe
noticed
it
and
endeavoured
to
talk
but
was
not
successful
miss
mehitable
few
words
which
were
invariably
addressed
to
him
were
so
acrid
in
quality
that
they
made
him
nervous
the
reverend
austin
thorpe
innocent
as
he
was
of
all
intentional
wrong
was
made
to
feel
like
a
criminal
haled
to
the
bar
of
justice
but
araminta
glowed
and
dimpled
and
smiled
her
eyes
danced
with
mischief
and
the
colour
came
and
went
upon
her
velvety
cheeks
she
took
pains
to
ask
aunt
hitty
for
the
salt
or
the
bread
and
kept
up
a
continuous
flow
of
talk
had
it
not
been
for
araminta
the
situation
would
have
become
openly
strained
afterward
she
began
to
clear
up
the
dishes
as
usual
but
miss
mehitable
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
with
a
violence
indicative
of
suppressed
passion
so
humming
a
hymn
at
an
irreverent
tempo
araminta
went
out
and
sat
down
on
the
front
porch
spreading
down
the
best
rug
in
the
house
that
she
might
not
soil
her
gown
this
also
was
forbidden
when
the
dishes
were
washed
and
put
away
miss
mehitable
came
out
clad
in
her
rustling
black
silk
and
her
best
bonnet
miss
lee
she
said
very
coldly
i
am
going
out
all
right
aunt
hitty
returned
araminta
cheerfully
as
it
happens
i
not
miss
mehitable
repressed
an
exclamation
of
horror
seemingly
then
it
had
occurred
to
araminta
to
go
out
in
the
evening
alone
miss
mehitable
feet
moved
swiftly
away
from
the
house
she
was
going
to
the
residence
of
the
oldest
and
most
orthodox
deacon
in
church
to
ask
for
guidance
in
dealing
with
her
wayward
charge
but
araminta
never
dreamed
of
this
dusk
came
the
sweet
june
dusk
starred
with
fireflies
and
clouded
with
great
white
moths
the
roses
and
mignonette
and
honeysuckle
made
the
air
delicately
fragrant
to
the
emancipated
one
it
was
indeed
a
beautiful
world
austin
thorpe
came
out
having
found
his
room
unbearably
close
as
the
sometimes
do
he
saw
more
clearly
at
twilight
than
at
other
times
you
here
child
he
asked
yes
i
here
replied
araminta
happily
sit
down
wo
you
having
taken
the
first
step
she
found
the
others
comparatively
easy
and
was
rejoicing
in
her
new
freedom
she
felt
sure
too
that
some
day
she
should
see
doctor
ralph
once
more
and
all
would
be
made
right
between
them
the
minister
sat
down
gladly
his
old
heart
yearning
toward
araminta
as
toward
a
loved
and
only
child
where
is
your
aunt
he
asked
timidly
goodness
knows
laughed
araminta
irreverently
she
gone
out
in
all
her
best
clothes
she
did
say
whether
she
was
coming
back
or
not
thorpe
was
startled
for
he
had
never
heard
speech
like
this
from
araminta
he
knew
her
only
as
a
docile
timid
child
now
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
up
for
her
part
araminta
remembered
how
the
minister
had
once
helped
her
out
of
a
difficulty
and
taken
away
from
her
forever
the
terrible
haunting
fear
of
hell
here
was
a
dazzling
opportunity
to
acquire
new
knowledge
thorpe
she
demanded
eagerly
what
is
it
to
be
married
to
be
married
repeated
austin
thorpe
dreamily
his
eyes
fixed
upon
a
firefly
that
flitted
near
the
rose
is
i
think
the
nearest
this
world
can
come
to
heaven
oh
cried
araminta
in
astonishment
what
does
it
mean
it
means
answered
thorpe
softly
that
a
man
and
a
woman
whom
god
meant
to
be
mated
have
found
each
other
at
last
it
means
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
you
have
to
face
alone
that
all
your
joys
are
doubled
and
all
your
sorrows
shared
it
means
that
there
is
no
depth
into
which
you
can
go
alone
that
one
other
hand
is
always
in
yours
trusting
clinging
tender
to
help
you
bear
whatever
comes
it
means
that
the
infinite
love
has
been
given
in
part
to
you
for
daily
strength
and
comfort
it
is
a
balm
for
every
wound
a
spur
for
every
lagging
a
sure
dependence
in
every
weakness
a
belief
in
every
doubt
the
perfect
being
is
neither
man
nor
woman
but
a
merging
of
dual
natures
into
a
united
whole
to
be
married
gives
a
man
a
tenderness
a
woman
a
man
courage
the
long
years
stretch
before
them
and
what
lies
beyond
no
one
can
say
but
they
face
it
smiling
and
serene
because
they
are
together
my
mother
was
married
said
araminta
softly
all
at
once
the
stain
of
disgrace
was
wiped
out
yes
dear
child
and
i
hope
to
the
man
she
loved
as
i
hope
that
some
day
you
will
be
married
to
the
man
who
loves
you
araminta
whole
heart
yearned
toward
ralph
yearned
unspeakably
in
something
else
surely
aunt
hitty
was
wrong
araminta
said
thorpe
his
voice
shaking
dear
child
come
here
she
followed
him
into
the
house
his
trembling
old
hands
lighted
a
candle
and
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
from
an
inner
pocket
he
drew
out
a
small
case
wrapped
in
many
thicknesses
of
worn
paper
he
unwound
it
reverently
his
face
alight
with
a
look
she
had
never
seen
there
before
see
he
said
he
opened
the
ornate
case
and
showed
her
an
old
daguerreotype
a
sweet
girlish
face
looked
out
at
her
a
woman
with
trusting
loving
eyes
a
sweet
mouth
and
dark
softly
parted
hair
oh
whispered
araminta
were
you
married
to
her
no
answered
thorpe
hoarsely
shutting
the
case
with
a
snap
and
beginning
to
wrap
it
again
in
the
many
folds
of
paper
i
was
to
have
been
married
to
her
his
voice
lingered
with
inexpressible
fondness
upon
the
words
she
died
he
said
his
lips
quivering
oh
cried
the
girl
i
sorry
a
sharp
pang
pierced
her
through
and
through
child
said
thorpe
his
wrinkled
hand
closing
on
hers
to
those
who
love
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
do
you
think
that
just
because
she
is
dead
i
have
ceased
to
care
death
has
made
her
mine
as
life
could
never
do
she
walks
beside
me
daily
as
though
we
were
hand
in
hand
her
tenderness
makes
me
tender
her
courage
gives
me
strength
her
great
charity
makes
me
kind
her
belief
has
made
my
own
faith
more
sure
her
steadfastness
keeps
me
from
faltering
and
her
patience
enables
me
to
wait
until
the
end
when
i
go
into
the
unknown
to
meet
her
child
i
do
not
know
if
there
be
a
heaven
but
if
god
gives
me
her
and
her
love
as
i
knew
it
once
i
shall
not
ask
for
more
unable
to
say
more
for
the
tears
thorpe
stumbled
out
of
the
room
araminta
own
eyes
were
wet
and
her
heart
was
strangely
tender
to
all
the
world
miss
evelina
the
kitten
thorpe
doctor
ralph
even
aunt
hitty
were
all
included
in
a
wave
of
unspeakable
tenderness
never
stopping
to
question
araminta
sped
out
of
the
house
her
feet
following
where
her
heart
led
past
the
crossroads
to
the
right
down
into
the
village
across
the
tracks
then
sharply
to
the
left
up
to
doctor
dexter
where
only
a
few
weeks
before
she
had
gone
in
the
hope
of
seeing
doctor
ralph
araminta
ran
like
some
young
atalanta
across
whose
path
no
golden
apples
were
thrown
the
door
was
open
and
she
rushed
in
unthinking
turning
by
instinct
into
the
library
where
ralph
sat
alone
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
doctor
ralph
she
cried
i
come
he
looked
up
then
started
forward
one
look
into
her
glorified
face
told
him
all
that
he
needed
to
know
undine
he
said
huskily
have
you
found
your
soul
i
do
know
what
i
found
sobbed
araminta
from
the
shelter
of
his
arms
but
i
come
to
stay
with
you
always
if
you
let
me
if
i
let
you
murmured
ralph
kissing
away
her
happy
tears
you
little
saint
it
what
i
want
as
i
want
nothing
else
in
the
world
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
married
said
araminta
after
a
little
her
grave
sweet
eyes
on
his
i
asked
thorpe
and
he
told
me
it
to
be
always
with
the
one
you
love
and
never
to
mind
what
anybody
else
says
or
does
it
to
help
each
other
bear
everything
and
be
twice
as
happy
because
you
together
it
means
that
somebody
will
always
help
you
when
things
go
wrong
and
there
always
be
something
you
can
lean
on
you
never
be
afraid
of
anything
because
together
my
mother
was
married
your
mother
was
married
and
found
out
that
aunt
hitty
mother
was
married
too
and
thorpe
he
would
have
been
married
but
she
died
he
told
me
and
he
showed
me
her
picture
and
he
says
that
it
does
make
any
difference
to
be
dead
when
you
love
anybody
and
that
heaven
for
him
will
be
where
she
waits
for
him
and
puts
her
hand
in
his
again
he
was
crying
and
so
was
i
but
it
because
he
has
her
and
i
have
you
sweetheart
darling
cried
ralph
crushing
her
into
his
close
embrace
it
god
himself
who
brought
you
to
me
now
no
returned
araminta
missing
the
point
i
came
all
by
myself
and
i
ran
all
the
way
nobody
brought
me
but
i
come
for
always
and
i
never
leave
you
again
i
sorry
i
broke
your
heart
you
made
it
well
again
he
said
fondly
and
so
we
be
married
you
and
i
yes
repeated
araminta
her
beautiful
face
alight
with
love
be
married
you
and
i
sweet
he
said
do
you
think
i
deserve
so
much
being
married
is
giving
everything
she
explained
but
i
anything
at
all
only
eight
quilts
and
me
do
you
care
for
quilts
quilts
be
everlastingly
condemned
i
going
to
tell
aunt
hitty
no
said
araminta
i
going
to
tell
her
my
own
self
so
now
and
i
tell
her
it
was
after
ten
when
ralph
took
araminta
home
from
the
parlour
window
miss
mehitable
was
watching
anxiously
she
had
divested
herself
of
the
rustling
black
silk
and
was
safely
screened
by
the
shutters
she
had
been
at
home
an
hour
or
more
and
though
she
had
received
plenty
of
good
advice
of
a
stern
nature
from
her
orthodox
counsellor
her
mind
was
far
from
at
rest
having
conjured
up
all
sorts
of
dire
happenings
she
was
relieved
when
she
heard
voices
outside
miss
mehitable
peered
out
eagerly
from
behind
the
shutters
up
the
road
came
araminta
may
the
saints
preserve
us
with
a
man
miss
mehitable
quickly
placed
him
as
that
blackmailing
who
now
should
never
have
his
four
dollars
and
a
half
unless
he
collected
it
by
law
only
in
the
last
ditch
would
she
surrender
they
were
talking
and
laughing
and
ralph
arm
was
around
araminta
waist
they
came
slowly
to
the
gate
where
they
stopped
araminta
laid
her
head
confidingly
upon
ralph
shoulder
and
he
held
her
tightly
in
his
arms
kissing
her
repeatedly
as
miss
mehitable
guessed
though
she
could
not
see
very
well
at
last
they
parted
and
araminta
ran
lightly
into
the
house
saying
in
a
low
tender
voice
dear
she
went
singing
even
then
miss
mehitable
observed
that
it
was
not
a
hymn
but
some
light
and
ungodly
tune
she
had
picked
up
heaven
knew
where
she
went
to
her
room
still
humming
and
presently
her
light
was
out
but
her
guardian
angel
was
too
stiff
with
horror
to
move
o
lord
prayed
araminta
as
she
sank
to
sleep
keep
me
from
the
contamination
of
not
being
married
to
him
for
thy
sake
amen
xxiv
telling
aunt
hitty
araminta
woke
with
the
birds
as
yet
it
was
dark
but
from
afar
came
the
cheery
voice
of
a
robin
piping
gaily
of
coming
dawn
when
the
first
ray
of
light
crept
into
her
room
and
every
bird
for
miles
around
was
swelling
his
tiny
throat
in
song
it
seemed
to
her
that
until
now
she
had
never
truly
lived
the
bird
that
rocked
on
the
maple
branch
outside
her
window
carolling
with
all
his
might
was
no
more
free
than
she
love
had
rolled
away
the
stone
aunt
hitty
had
set
before
the
door
of
araminta
heart
and
the
imprisoned
thing
was
trying
its
wings
as
joyously
as
the
birds
themselves
every
sense
was
exquisitely
alive
and
thrilling
had
she
been
older
and
known
more
of
the
world
love
would
not
have
come
to
her
so
but
rather
with
a
great
peace
an
unending
trust
but
having
waked
as
surely
as
the
sleeping
princess
in
the
tower
she
knew
the
uttermost
ecstasy
of
it
heard
the
sound
of
singing
trumpets
and
saw
the
white
light
her
fear
of
aunt
hitty
had
died
mysteriously
and
suddenly
she
appreciated
now
as
never
before
all
that
had
been
done
for
her
she
saw
too
that
many
things
had
been
done
that
were
better
left
undone
but
in
her
happy
heart
was
no
condemnation
for
anybody
or
anything
araminta
dressed
leisurely
usually
she
hurried
into
her
clothes
and
ran
to
help
aunt
hitty
who
was
always
ready
for
the
work
before
anybody
else
was
awake
but
this
morning
she
took
her
time
she
loved
the
coolness
of
the
water
on
her
face
she
loved
her
white
plump
arms
her
softly
rounded
throat
the
velvety
roses
that
blossomed
on
her
cheeks
and
the
wavy
brown
masses
of
her
hair
touched
by
the
sun
into
tints
of
copper
and
gold
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
life
araminta
realised
that
she
was
beautiful
she
did
not
know
that
love
brings
beauty
with
it
nor
that
the
light
in
her
eyes
like
a
new
star
had
not
risen
until
last
night
she
was
seriously
tempted
to
slide
down
the
banister
this
also
having
been
interdicted
since
her
earliest
remembrance
but
being
a
grown
woman
now
she
compromised
with
herself
by
taking
two
stairs
at
a
time
in
a
light
skipping
perilous
movement
that
landed
her
safe
but
breathless
in
the
lower
hall
in
the
kitchen
wearing
an
aspect
distinctly
funereal
was
miss
mehitable
her
brisk
active
manner
was
gone
and
she
moved
slowly
she
did
not
once
look
up
as
araminta
came
in
aunt
hitty
cried
the
girl
pirouetting
around
the
bare
floor
is
this
the
beautifullest
morning
that
ever
was
and
you
glad
you
alive
no
returned
miss
mehitable
acidly
i
am
not
are
you
asked
araminta
casually
too
happy
to
be
deeply
concerned
about
anybody
else
why
what
wrong
i
should
think
araminta
lee
that
you
be
the
last
one
on
earth
to
ask
what
wrong
the
flood
gates
were
open
now
was
it
only
yesterday
that
you
broke
away
from
all
restraint
and
refused
to
make
any
more
quilts
did
you
put
on
your
best
dress
in
the
afternoon
when
want
sunday
and
i
had
told
you
that
you
could
did
you
pick
a
rose
and
stick
it
into
your
hair
and
have
i
ever
allowed
you
to
pick
a
flower
on
the
place
to
say
nothing
of
doing
anything
so
foolish
as
to
put
it
in
your
hair
flowers
and
hair
do
go
together
there
hair
in
the
parlour
objected
araminta
frivolously
made
up
into
a
wreath
of
flowers
so
i
thought
as
long
as
you
had
them
made
out
of
dead
people
hair
i
put
some
roses
in
mine
now
while
alive
miss
mehitable
compressed
her
lips
sternly
and
went
on
did
you
take
a
rug
out
of
the
parlour
last
night
and
spread
it
on
the
porch
and
have
i
ever
had
rugs
outdoor
except
when
they
was
being
beat
and
did
you
sit
down
on
the
front
porch
where
i
never
allowed
you
to
sit
it
not
being
modest
for
a
young
female
to
sit
outside
of
her
house
yes
admitted
araminta
cheerfully
i
did
all
those
things
and
i
put
my
hair
up
loosely
instead
of
tightly
as
you
always
taught
me
you
forgot
that
no
i
did
denied
miss
mehitable
vigorously
i
was
coming
to
that
did
you
go
up
to
miss
evelina
without
asking
me
if
you
could
and
did
you
go
bareheaded
as
i
never
allowed
you
to
do
yes
laughed
araminta
i
did
after
i
went
away
pursued
miss
mehitable
swiftly
approaching
her
climax
did
you
go
up
to
doctor
dexter
like
a
shameless
hussy
if
it
makes
a
shameless
hussy
of
me
to
go
to
doctor
dexter
what
i
am
you
went
there
to
see
doctor
ralph
dexter
did
you
yes
i
did
sang
araminta
and
oh
aunt
hitty
he
was
there
he
was
there
ai
i
told
you
demanded
miss
mehitable
how
one
woman
went
up
there
when
she
had
no
business
to
go
and
got
burnt
so
awful
that
she
has
to
wear
a
veil
all
the
rest
of
her
life
yes
you
told
me
aunt
hitty
but
you
see
i
did
get
burned
araminta
lee
you
going
right
straight
to
hell
just
as
fast
as
you
can
get
there
perdition
is
yawning
at
your
feet
did
that
blackmailing
come
home
with
you
ralph
said
araminta
and
the
way
she
spoke
his
name
made
it
a
caress
ralph
came
home
with
me
i
saw
you
comin
home
continued
miss
mehitable
with
her
sharp
eyes
keenly
fixed
upon
the
culprit
i
saw
his
arm
around
your
waist
and
you
leanin
your
head
on
his
shoulder
yes
laughed
araminta
i
have
forgotten
i
can
feel
his
arms
around
me
now
and
at
the
gate
you
need
deny
it
for
i
saw
it
all
he
kissed
you
that
right
aunt
hitty
at
his
house
he
kissed
me
too
lots
and
lots
of
times
and
she
added
her
eyes
meeting
her
clearly
i
kissed
him
how
do
you
suppose
i
feel
to
see
such
goin
on
after
all
i
done
for
you
you
need
have
looked
aunty
if
you
did
like
to
see
it
do
you
know
where
i
went
when
i
went
out
i
went
up
to
deacon
robinson
to
lay
your
case
before
him
miss
mehitable
paused
for
the
worthy
deacon
was
the
fearsome
spectre
of
young
sinners
araminta
executed
an
intricate
dance
step
of
her
own
devising
but
did
not
seem
interested
in
the
advice
he
had
given
he
told
me
went
on
miss
mehitable
in
the
manner
of
a
judge
pronouncing
sentence
upon
a
criminal
that
at
any
cost
i
must
trample
down
this
godless
uprising
and
assert
my
rightful
authority
thy
father
and
thy
mother
the
bible
says
and
i
your
father
and
mother
rolled
into
one
he
said
that
if
i
could
make
you
listen
in
any
other
way
it
would
be
right
and
proper
for
me
to
shut
you
up
in
your
room
and
keep
you
on
bread
and
water
until
you
came
to
your
senses
araminta
giggled
i
would
be
there
long
she
said
how
funny
it
would
be
for
ralph
to
come
with
a
ladder
and
take
me
out
araminta
lee
what
do
you
mean
why
explained
the
girl
we
going
to
be
married
ralph
and
i
a
nihilist
bomb
thrown
into
the
immaculate
kitchen
could
not
have
surprised
miss
mehitable
more
she
had
no
idea
that
it
had
gone
so
far
married
she
gasped
you
not
just
me
alone
aunty
but
ralph
and
i
there
has
to
be
two
and
i
of
age
so
i
can
if
i
want
to
this
last
heresy
had
been
learned
from
ralph
only
the
night
before
married
gasped
miss
mehitable
again
yes
returned
araminta
firmly
married
my
mother
was
married
and
ralph
mother
was
married
and
your
mother
was
married
mother
is
married
and
thorpe
says
it
the
nearest
there
is
to
heaven
he
was
going
to
be
married
himself
but
she
died
dear
aunt
hitty
cooed
araminta
with
winning
sweetness
do
look
so
frightened
it
nothing
dreadful
it
only
natural
and
right
and
i
the
happiest
girl
the
sun
shines
on
do
be
selfish
aunty
you
had
me
all
my
life
and
it
his
turn
now
i
come
to
see
you
every
day
and
you
can
come
and
see
me
kiss
me
and
tell
me
you
glad
i
going
to
be
married
at
this
juncture
thorpe
entered
the
kitchen
not
aware
that
he
was
upon
forbidden
ground
attracted
by
the
sound
of
voices
he
had
come
in
just
in
time
to
hear
araminta
last
words
dear
child
he
said
his
fine
old
face
illumined
and
so
going
to
be
married
to
the
man
you
love
i
so
glad
god
bless
you
he
stooped
and
kissed
araminta
gently
upon
the
forehead
having
thus
seen
as
it
were
the
sanction
of
the
church
placed
upon
araminta
startling
announcement
miss
mehitable
could
say
no
more
during
breakfast
she
did
not
speak
at
all
even
to
thorpe
araminta
chattered
gleefully
of
everything
under
the
blue
heaven
and
even
the
minister
noted
the
liquid
melody
of
her
voice
afterward
she
went
out
as
naturally
as
a
flower
turns
toward
the
sun
it
was
a
part
of
the
magic
beauty
of
the
world
that
she
should
meet
ralph
just
outside
the
gate
with
a
face
as
radiant
as
her
own
i
was
coming
he
said
after
the
first
rapture
had
somewhat
subsided
to
tell
aunt
hitty
i
told
her
returned
the
girl
proudly
all
by
my
own
self
you
do
mean
it
what
did
she
say
she
said
everything
she
told
me
hell
was
yawning
at
my
feet
but
sure
it
heaven
she
said
that
she
was
my
father
and
mother
rolled
into
one
and
i
was
obliged
to
remind
her
that
i
was
of
age
you
thought
of
that
she
said
admiringly
i
did
even
know
that
ever
get
old
enough
not
to
mind
anybody
but
myself
or
you
you
wo
have
to
me
laughed
ralph
i
give
you
a
long
rope
what
would
i
do
with
a
rope
queried
araminta
seriously
you
funny
funny
girl
did
you
ever
see
a
cow
staked
out
in
a
pasture
yes
am
i
a
cow
for
the
purposes
of
illustration
yes
and
aunt
hitty
represents
the
stake
for
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
your
rope
has
been
so
short
that
you
could
hardly
move
at
all
now
things
are
changed
and
i
represent
the
stake
you
got
the
longest
rope
now
that
was
ever
made
in
one
piece
see
i
come
back
answered
araminta
seriously
i
do
think
i
need
any
rope
at
all
no
dear
i
know
that
i
was
only
joking
you
poor
child
lived
so
long
with
that
old
dragon
that
you
scarcely
recognise
a
joke
when
you
see
one
a
sense
of
humour
araminta
is
a
saving
grace
for
anybody
next
to
love
it
the
finest
gift
of
the
gods
have
i
got
it
i
guess
so
i
think
it
asleep
but
we
wake
it
up
look
here
dear
see
what
i
brought
you
from
his
pocket
ralph
took
a
small
purple
velvet
case
lined
with
white
satin
within
was
a
ring
set
with
a
diamond
small
in
circumference
but
deep
and
of
unusual
brilliancy
by
a
singular
coincidence
it
fitted
araminta
third
finger
exactly
she
cried
her
cheeks
glowing
for
me
yes
for
you
till
i
get
you
another
one
this
was
my
mother
ring
sweetheart
i
found
it
among
my
father
things
will
you
wear
it
for
her
sake
and
for
mine
i
wear
it
always
answered
araminta
her
great
grey
eyes
on
his
and
i
do
want
any
other
ring
why
if
it
had
been
for
her
i
never
could
have
had
you
ralph
took
her
into
his
arms
his
heart
was
filled
with
that
supreme
love
which
has
no
need
of
words
meanwhile
miss
mehitable
was
having
her
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
thorpe
had
taken
himself
away
from
a
spot
where
he
felt
there
was
about
to
be
a
display
of
emotion
she
was
in
the
house
alone
and
the
acute
stillness
of
it
seemed
an
accurate
foreshadowing
of
the
future
miss
mehitable
was
not
among
those
rare
souls
who
are
seldom
lonely
her
nature
demanded
continuous
conversation
the
subject
alone
being
unimportant
every
thought
that
came
into
her
mind
was
destined
for
a
normal
outlet
in
speech
she
had
no
mental
reservoir
araminta
was
going
away
to
be
married
in
spite
of
her
trouble
miss
mehitable
noted
the
taint
of
heredity
it
in
her
blood
she
murmured
and
maybe
minty
ai
so
much
to
blame
in
this
crisis
however
miss
mehitable
had
the
valiant
support
of
her
conscience
she
had
never
allowed
the
child
to
play
with
boys
in
fact
she
had
not
had
any
playmates
at
all
as
soon
as
araminta
was
old
enough
to
understand
she
was
taught
that
boys
and
men
indeed
all
human
things
that
wore
trousers
long
or
short
were
rank
poison
and
were
to
be
steadfastly
avoided
if
a
woman
desired
peace
of
mind
miss
mehitable
frequently
said
that
she
had
everything
a
husband
could
have
given
her
except
a
lot
of
trouble
daily
almost
hourly
the
wisdom
of
single
blessedness
had
been
impressed
upon
araminta
miss
mehitable
neglected
no
illustration
calculated
to
bring
the
lesson
home
she
had
even
taught
her
that
her
own
mother
was
an
outcast
and
had
brought
disgrace
upon
her
family
by
marrying
she
had
held
aloft
her
maiden
standard
and
literally
compelled
araminta
to
enlist
now
all
her
work
had
gone
for
naught
nature
had
triumphantly
reasserted
itself
and
araminta
had
fallen
in
love
the
years
stretched
before
miss
mehitable
in
a
vast
and
gloomy
vista
illumined
by
no
light
no
soft
step
upon
the
stair
no
sunny
face
at
her
table
no
sweet
girlish
laugh
no
long
companionable
afternoons
with
patchwork
while
she
talked
and
araminta
listened
at
the
thought
her
stern
mouth
quivered
ever
so
slightly
and
all
at
once
she
found
the
relief
of
tears
an
hour
or
so
afterward
she
went
up
to
the
attic
walking
with
a
stealthy
tread
though
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
to
hear
in
a
corner
far
back
under
the
eaves
three
trunks
were
piled
one
on
top
of
the
other
miss
hitty
lifted
off
the
two
top
trunks
without
apparent
effort
for
her
arms
were
strong
and
drew
the
lowest
one
out
into
the
path
of
sunlight
that
lay
upon
the
floor
maple
branches
swaying
across
it
in
silhouette
in
another
corner
of
the
attic
up
among
the
rafters
was
a
box
apparently
filled
with
old
newspapers
miss
hitty
reached
down
among
the
newspapers
with
accustomed
fingers
and
drew
out
a
crumpled
wad
tightly
wedged
into
one
corner
of
the
box
she
listened
carefully
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
step
in
the
house
she
was
absolutely
alone
none
the
less
she
bolted
the
door
of
the
attic
before
she
picked
the
crumpled
paper
apart
and
took
out
the
key
of
the
trunk
the
old
lock
opened
readily
and
from
the
trunk
came
the
musty
odour
of
lavender
and
rosemary
lemon
verbena
and
rose
geranium
on
top
was
barbara
lee
wedding
gown
miss
hitty
always
handled
it
with
reverence
not
unmixed
with
awe
never
having
had
a
wedding
gown
herself
underneath
were
the
baby
clothes
which
the
had
begun
to
make
when
she
first
knew
of
her
child
coming
the
cloth
was
none
too
fine
and
the
little
garments
were
awkwardly
cut
and
badly
sewn
but
every
stitch
had
been
guided
by
a
great
love
araminta
first
shoes
were
there
too
soft
formless
things
of
discoloured
white
kid
folded
in
a
yellowed
paper
was
a
tiny
golden
curl
snipped
secretly
and
marked
on
the
outside
minty
hair
farther
down
in
the
trunk
were
the
few
relics
of
miss
girlhood
a
primer
a
string
of
bright
buttons
a
broken
slate
a
ragged
disreputable
doll
and
a
few
blown
birds
eggs
carefully
packed
away
in
a
small
box
of
cotton
these
were
her
treasures
there
was
an
old
autograph
album
with
a
gay
blue
cover
which
the
years
in
the
trunk
had
not
served
to
fade
far
down
in
the
trunk
was
a
package
which
miss
mehitable
took
out
reverently
it
was
large
and
flat
and
tied
with
heavy
string
in
hard
knots
she
untied
the
knots
patiently
her
mother
had
taught
her
never
to
cut
a
string
underneath
was
more
paper
and
more
string
it
took
her
half
an
hour
to
bring
to
light
the
inmost
contents
of
the
package
bound
in
layer
after
layer
of
fine
muslin
but
not
tied
she
unrolled
the
yellowed
cloth
carefully
for
it
was
very
frail
at
last
she
took
out
a
photograph
anthony
dexter
at
and
gazed
at
it
long
on
one
page
of
her
autograph
album
was
written
an
old
rhyme
the
ink
had
faded
so
that
it
was
scarcely
legible
but
miss
hitty
knew
it
by
heart
you
love
me
as
i
love
you
no
knife
can
cut
our
love
in
two
your
sincere
friend
anthony
dexter
like
a
tiny
sprig
of
lavender
taken
from
a
bush
which
has
never
bloomed
this
bit
of
romance
lay
far
back
in
the
secret
places
of
her
life
she
had
a
knot
of
blue
ribbon
which
anthony
dexter
had
once
given
her
a
lead
pencil
which
he
had
gallantly
sharpened
and
which
she
had
never
used
her
life
had
been
barren
miss
mehitable
knew
that
and
in
her
hours
of
admitted
it
she
would
gladly
have
taken
evelina
full
measure
of
suffering
in
exchange
for
one
tithe
of
araminta
joy
after
anthony
dexter
had
turned
from
her
to
evelina
miss
mehitable
had
openly
scorned
him
she
had
spent
the
rest
of
her
life
since
in
showing
him
and
the
rest
that
men
were
nothing
to
her
and
that
he
was
least
of
all
she
had
hovered
near
his
patients
simply
for
the
sake
of
seeing
him
she
did
not
care
for
them
at
all
she
sat
in
the
front
window
that
she
might
see
him
drive
by
and
counted
that
day
lost
which
brought
her
no
sight
of
him
this
was
her
one
tenderness
her
one
vulnerable
point
the
afternoon
shadows
grew
long
and
the
maple
branches
ceased
to
sway
outside
a
bird
crooned
a
lullaby
to
his
nesting
mate
an
oriole
perched
on
the
topmost
twig
of
an
evergreen
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
and
opened
his
golden
throat
in
a
rapture
of
song
love
was
abroad
in
the
world
that
day
bees
hummed
it
birds
sang
it
roses
breathed
it
the
black
and
gold
messengers
of
the
fields
bore
velvety
pollen
from
flower
to
flower
moving
lazily
on
shimmering
gossamer
wings
a
rose
from
a
distant
clover
field
dropping
exquisite
silvery
notes
as
he
flew
the
scent
of
green
fields
and
honeysuckles
came
in
at
the
open
window
mingled
inextricably
with
the
croon
of
the
bees
but
miss
mehitable
knew
only
that
it
was
summer
that
the
world
was
young
but
she
was
old
and
alone
and
would
be
alone
for
the
rest
of
her
life
she
leaned
forward
to
look
at
the
picture
and
anthony
dexter
smiled
back
at
her
boyish
frank
eager
lovable
a
tear
dropped
on
the
pictured
face
not
the
first
one
for
the
photograph
was
blistered
oddly
here
and
there
i
done
all
i
could
said
miss
mehitable
to
herself
as
she
wrapped
it
up
again
in
its
many
yellowed
folds
of
muslin
i
thought
minty
would
be
happier
so
but
maybe
after
all
god
knows
best
xxv
redeemed
miss
evelina
sat
alone
in
her
house
at
peace
with
anthony
dexter
and
with
all
the
world
the
surging
flood
of
forgiveness
and
compassion
which
had
swept
over
her
as
she
gazed
at
his
dead
face
had
broken
down
all
barriers
abrogated
all
reserves
she
saw
that
piper
tom
was
right
had
she
forgiven
him
she
would
have
been
free
long
ago
she
shrank
no
longer
from
her
kind
but
yearned
instead
for
friendly
companionship
once
she
had
taken
off
her
veil
and
started
down
the
road
to
miss
mehitable
but
the
habit
of
the
years
was
strong
upon
her
and
she
turned
back
affrighted
when
she
came
within
sight
of
the
house
since
she
left
the
hospital
no
human
being
had
seen
her
face
save
anthony
dexter
and
his
son
she
had
crept
into
the
shelter
of
her
chiffon
dimly
taking
note
of
a
world
which
could
not
in
turn
look
upon
her
she
clung
to
it
still
yet
perceived
that
it
was
a
lie
she
studied
herself
in
the
mirror
no
longer
hating
the
sight
of
her
own
face
she
was
not
now
blind
to
her
own
beauty
nor
did
she
fail
to
see
that
transfiguring
touch
of
sorrow
and
peace
these
two
are
sculptors
one
working
both
from
within
and
without
and
the
other
only
from
within
why
should
she
not
put
her
veil
forever
away
from
her
now
why
should
she
not
meet
the
world
face
to
face
as
frankly
as
the
world
met
her
why
should
she
delay
she
had
questioned
herself
continually
but
found
no
answer
since
she
came
back
to
her
old
home
she
had
been
mysteriously
led
perhaps
she
was
to
be
led
further
through
the
deep
mazes
of
life
it
was
not
only
possible
but
probable
i
wait
she
said
to
herself
for
a
sign
she
had
not
seen
the
piper
since
the
day
they
met
so
strangely
with
anthony
dexter
lying
dead
between
them
quite
often
however
she
had
heard
the
flute
usually
at
sunrise
or
sunset
afar
off
in
the
hills
once
at
the
hour
of
the
turning
night
the
melody
had
come
to
her
on
the
first
grey
winds
of
dawn
a
robin
had
waked
to
answer
it
for
the
piper
fluting
was
wondrously
like
his
own
voice
contrasting
her
present
peace
with
her
days
of
torment
miss
evelina
thrilled
with
gratitude
to
piper
tom
who
had
taken
the
weeds
out
of
her
garden
in
more
senses
than
one
his
hand
had
guided
her
slowly
yet
surely
to
the
heights
of
calm
she
saw
her
life
now
as
a
desolate
valley
lying
between
two
peaks
one
was
sunlit
yet
opaline
with
the
mists
of
morning
the
other
was
scarcely
a
peak
but
merely
a
high
and
grassy
plain
upon
which
the
afternoon
shadows
lay
long
ah
but
there
were
terrors
in
the
dark
valley
which
lay
between
sharp
crags
and
treeless
wastes
tortuous
paths
and
abysmal
depths
with
never
a
rest
for
the
wayfarer
who
struggled
blindly
on
she
was
not
yet
so
secure
upon
the
height
that
she
could
contemplate
the
valley
unmoved
her
house
was
immaculate
now
and
was
kept
so
by
her
own
hands
at
first
she
had
not
cared
and
the
dust
and
the
cobwebs
had
not
mattered
at
all
miss
mehitable
in
the
beginning
had
inspired
her
to
housewifely
effort
and
doctor
ralph
personal
neatness
had
made
her
ashamed
she
worked
in
the
garden
too
keeping
the
paths
free
from
weeds
and
faithfully
attending
to
every
plant
yet
life
seemed
strangely
empty
lifted
above
its
pain
the
house
and
garden
did
not
occupy
her
fully
and
she
had
few
books
these
were
all
old
ones
and
she
knew
them
by
heart
though
she
had
found
some
pleasure
in
reading
again
the
fairy
books
of
her
childhood
she
had
read
the
book
which
ralph
had
brought
araminta
and
thought
of
asking
him
to
lend
her
more
if
she
ever
saw
him
again
she
knew
that
he
was
very
busy
but
she
felt
that
surely
he
would
come
again
before
long
araminta
danced
up
the
path
singing
and
rapped
at
miss
door
when
she
came
in
it
was
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
in
a
gloomy
place
miss
evelina
she
cried
oh
miss
evelina
i
going
to
be
married
i
glad
said
evelina
tenderly
yet
with
a
certain
wistfulness
once
the
joy
of
it
had
been
in
her
feet
too
and
the
dread
valley
of
desolation
had
opened
before
her
see
cried
araminta
extending
a
dimpled
hand
see
my
ring
my
engagement
ring
she
added
proudly
miss
evelina
winced
a
little
behind
her
veil
for
the
ring
was
the
one
anthony
dexter
had
given
her
soon
after
their
betrothal
fearing
gossip
she
had
refused
to
wear
it
until
after
they
were
married
so
he
had
taken
it
to
have
it
engraved
but
evidently
the
engraving
had
never
been
done
otherwise
ralph
would
not
have
given
it
to
araminta
she
was
sure
of
that
it
was
his
mother
ring
miss
evelina
and
now
it
mine
his
father
loved
his
mother
just
as
ralph
loves
me
it
so
funny
not
to
have
to
say
ralph
oh
i
so
glad
i
broke
my
ankle
he
coming
but
i
wanted
to
come
first
by
myself
i
made
him
wait
for
five
minutes
down
under
the
elm
because
i
wanted
to
tell
you
first
i
told
aunt
hitty
all
alone
and
i
was
a
bit
afraid
oh
miss
evelina
i
wish
you
had
somebody
to
love
you
as
he
loves
me
so
do
i
murmured
evelina
grateful
for
the
chiffon
that
hid
her
tears
was
there
ever
anybody
yes
i
knew
it
you
so
sweet
nobody
could
help
loving
you
did
he
die
yes
it
was
that
way
with
thorpe
mused
araminta
reminiscently
they
loved
each
other
and
were
going
to
be
married
but
she
died
he
said
though
that
death
did
make
any
difference
with
loving
there
ralph
now
little
witch
said
the
boy
fondly
as
she
met
him
at
the
door
did
you
think
i
could
wait
a
whole
five
minutes
they
sat
in
the
parlour
for
half
an
hour
or
more
and
during
this
time
it
was
not
necessary
for
their
hostess
to
say
a
single
word
they
were
quite
unaware
that
they
were
not
properly
conducting
a
conversation
and
miss
evelina
made
no
effort
to
enlighten
them
youth
and
laughter
and
love
had
not
been
in
her
house
before
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
come
again
she
begged
when
they
started
home
joy
incarnate
was
a
welcome
guest
it
did
not
mock
her
now
down
the
path
ralph
turned
back
to
the
veiled
woman
who
stood
wistfully
in
the
doorway
araminta
was
swinging
in
childish
fashion
upon
the
gate
ralph
took
miss
evelina
hand
in
his
i
wish
i
could
say
all
i
feel
he
began
awkwardly
but
i
ca
with
all
my
heart
i
wish
i
could
give
some
of
my
happiness
to
you
i
am
content
since
i
have
forgiven
if
you
had
not
i
could
never
have
been
happy
again
and
even
now
i
still
feel
the
shame
of
it
are
you
going
to
wear
that
veil
always
no
she
whispered
shrinking
back
into
the
shelter
of
it
but
i
am
waiting
for
a
sign
may
it
soon
come
said
ralph
earnestly
i
am
used
to
waiting
my
life
has
been
made
up
of
waiting
god
bless
you
she
concluded
impulsively
and
you
he
answered
touching
his
lips
to
her
hand
he
started
away
but
she
held
him
back
ralph
she
said
passionately
be
true
to
her
be
good
to
her
and
never
let
her
doubt
you
teach
her
to
trust
you
and
make
yourself
worthy
of
her
trust
never
break
a
promise
made
to
her
though
it
cost
you
everything
else
you
have
in
the
world
i
am
old
and
i
know
that
at
the
end
nothing
counts
for
an
instant
beside
the
love
of
two
remember
that
keeping
faith
with
her
is
keeping
faith
with
god
i
will
returned
ralph
his
voice
low
and
uneven
it
is
what
my
own
mother
would
have
said
to
me
had
she
been
alive
i
thank
you
the
house
was
very
lonely
after
they
had
gone
though
the
echoes
of
love
and
laughter
seemed
to
have
come
back
to
a
place
where
they
once
held
full
sway
the
afternoon
wore
to
its
longest
shadows
and
the
dense
shade
of
the
cypress
was
thrown
upon
the
garden
evelina
smiled
to
herself
for
it
was
only
a
shadow
the
mignonette
breathed
fragrance
into
the
dusk
scent
of
lavender
and
rosemary
filled
the
stillness
with
balm
drowsy
birds
chirped
sleepily
in
their
swaying
nests
and
the
fairy
folk
of
field
and
meadow
set
up
a
whirr
of
melodious
wings
white
ghostly
moths
fluttered
over
the
quiet
garden
and
here
and
there
a
tiny
starred
the
night
a
flaming
meteor
sped
across
the
uncharted
dark
of
the
heavens
where
only
the
shone
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
from
within
evelina
recognised
the
sturdy
figure
of
piper
tom
and
went
out
to
meet
him
as
he
approached
she
had
drawn
down
her
veil
but
her
heart
was
strangely
glad
shall
we
sit
in
the
garden
she
asked
aye
in
the
garden
answered
the
piper
since
is
for
the
last
time
his
voice
was
sad
and
evelina
yearned
to
help
him
even
as
he
had
helped
her
what
is
it
she
asked
is
it
anything
you
can
tell
me
only
that
i
be
trudging
on
my
work
here
is
done
i
can
do
no
more
then
let
me
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
you
made
me
see
things
in
their
true
relation
and
taught
me
how
to
forgive
i
was
in
bondage
and
you
made
me
free
the
piper
sprang
to
his
feet
spinner
in
the
sun
he
cried
is
it
true
just
as
i
thought
your
night
was
endless
has
the
light
come
tell
me
again
he
pleaded
ah
tell
me
is
true
it
is
true
said
evelina
with
solemn
joy
in
all
my
heart
there
is
nothing
but
forgiveness
the
anger
and
resentment
are
gone
all
gone
spinner
in
the
sun
breathed
the
piper
scarcely
conscious
that
he
spoke
the
words
aloud
my
spinner
in
the
sun
slowly
the
moon
climbed
toward
the
zenith
and
still
because
there
was
no
need
they
spoke
no
word
dew
rose
whitely
from
the
clover
fields
beyond
veiling
them
as
with
white
chiffon
it
was
the
piper
at
last
who
broke
the
silence
when
i
trudge
on
he
said
will
be
with
a
glad
heart
even
though
the
little
chap
is
no
longer
with
me
is
a
fair
brave
world
i
thinking
since
i
set
your
threads
to
going
right
again
i
called
you
he
added
softly
and
you
came
yes
said
evelina
happily
you
called
me
and
i
came
spinner
in
the
sun
said
the
piper
tenderly
have
you
guessed
my
work
why
keeping
the
shop
is
it
asked
evelina
wonderingly
the
needles
and
thread
and
pins
and
buttons
and
all
the
little
trifles
that
women
need
a
pedler
pack
set
up
in
a
house
the
piper
laughed
no
he
replied
i
thinking
that
is
not
my
work
nor
yet
the
music
that
has
no
tune
which
i
for
ever
playing
on
my
flute
lady
i
have
travelled
far
and
seen
much
and
always
there
has
been
one
thing
that
is
strangest
of
all
in
every
place
that
i
have
been
in
yet
there
has
been
a
church
and
a
minister
whose
business
was
to
watch
over
human
souls
he
told
them
what
was
right
according
to
his
own
thinking
which
far
from
saying
is
true
for
him
and
never
minded
anything
more
in
spite
of
blood
and
tears
and
agony
he
always
held
up
the
one
standard
and
i
thinking
has
always
pointed
to
the
hardest
way
to
reach
it
the
way
has
been
so
hard
that
many
have
never
reached
it
at
all
and
those
who
have
i
not
seen
that
they
are
the
happiest
or
the
kindest
nor
that
they
are
loved
the
most
in
the
same
place
too
there
is
always
a
doctor
whose
business
it
is
to
watch
over
the
body
if
you
have
a
broken
leg
or
a
broken
arm
or
a
fever
he
can
set
you
right
again
blind
eyes
can
be
made
to
see
and
deaf
ears
made
to
hear
but
lady
who
is
there
to
care
about
a
broken
heart
i
have
taken
in
my
pedler
pack
the
things
that
women
need
because
is
women
mostly
who
bear
the
heartaches
of
the
world
and
i
come
closer
to
them
so
what
you
say
i
have
done
for
you
i
have
done
for
many
more
i
trying
to
make
the
world
a
bit
easier
for
all
women
because
a
woman
gave
me
life
and
because
i
love
another
woman
in
another
way
he
added
his
voice
breaking
i
be
trudging
on
alone
though
would
be
easier
i
thinking
to
linger
here
evelina
heart
leaped
with
a
throb
of
the
old
pain
tell
me
about
her
she
said
because
it
seemed
the
only
thing
to
say
the
woman
i
love
answered
the
piper
is
not
for
me
she
never
be
thinking
of
stooping
to
such
as
i
and
i
not
be
insulting
her
by
asking
she
very
proud
but
she
could
be
tender
if
she
chose
and
she
the
bravest
soul
i
ever
knew
so
brave
that
she
fears
neither
death
nor
life
though
life
itself
has
not
been
kind
her
little
feet
have
been
set
upon
the
rough
pathways
almost
since
the
beginning
and
her
hands
catch
at
my
they
are
so
frail
they
fluttering
always
like
frightened
birds
and
the
fluttering
is
in
her
voice
too
and
her
face
ah
but
i
dreamed
of
her
face
i
thought
it
was
noble
beyond
all
words
with
eyes
like
the
first
deep
violets
of
spring
but
filled
with
compassion
for
all
the
world
so
brave
so
true
so
tender
it
might
be
that
i
thinking
if
i
could
see
it
once
with
love
on
it
for
me
that
i
never
be
asking
more
why
have
you
seen
her
face
asked
evelina
idly
to
relieve
an
awkward
pause
is
she
only
a
nay
she
not
a
she
lives
and
breathes
as
dreams
never
do
but
she
hides
her
face
because
she
is
so
beautiful
she
veils
her
face
from
me
as
once
she
veiled
her
soul
then
at
last
evelina
understood
she
felt
the
hot
blood
mantling
her
face
and
was
thankful
once
more
for
the
shelter
of
her
chiffon
spinner
in
the
sun
said
the
piper
with
suppressed
tenderness
were
you
thinking
i
could
see
you
more
than
once
or
twice
and
not
be
caring
were
you
thinking
i
could
have
the
inmost
soul
of
me
torn
because
been
hurt
and
never
be
knowing
what
lay
beyond
it
for
me
were
you
thinking
i
could
be
talking
to
you
day
after
day
without
having
the
longing
to
talk
with
you
always
and
now
that
i
done
my
best
for
you
and
given
you
all
that
rests
with
me
for
giving
do
you
see
why
i
be
trudging
on
alone
is
not
for
me
to
be
asking
it
for
god
knows
i
could
never
be
worthy
but
i
thought
of
heaven
as
a
place
where
you
and
i
might
fare
together
always
with
me
to
heal
your
wounds
help
you
over
the
rough
places
and
guide
you
through
the
dark
that
part
of
it
i
to
have
i
thinking
for
god
has
been
very
good
to
me
i
to
know
that
wherever
you
are
you
re
happy
at
last
because
it
been
given
me
to
lead
you
into
the
light
i
called
you
and
you
came
yes
said
evelina
her
voice
lingering
upon
the
words
you
called
me
and
i
came
and
was
redeemed
tell
me
in
your
thought
of
heaven
have
you
ever
asked
to
see
my
face
nay
cried
the
piper
do
you
think
i
be
asking
for
what
you
hide
from
me
i
know
that
is
because
you
are
so
beautiful
and
such
beauty
is
not
for
my
eyes
to
see
piper
tom
she
answered
dear
piper
tom
i
told
you
once
that
i
had
been
terribly
burned
i
was
hurt
so
badly
that
when
the
man
i
was
pledged
to
marry
and
whose
life
i
had
saved
was
told
that
every
feature
of
mine
was
destroyed
except
my
sight
he
went
away
and
never
came
back
any
more
the
brute
who
hurt
laddie
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
told
him
then
that
a
man
who
would
torture
a
dog
would
torture
a
woman
too
i
not
be
minding
the
scars
he
added
since
they
brave
scars
and
not
the
marks
of
sin
or
shame
i
thinking
that
is
the
brave
scars
that
have
made
you
so
beautiful
so
beautiful
he
repeated
that
you
hide
your
face
into
evelina
heart
came
something
new
and
sweet
that
perfect
absolute
unwavering
trust
which
a
woman
has
but
once
in
her
life
and
of
which
anthony
dexter
had
never
given
her
the
faintest
hint
all
at
once
she
knew
that
she
could
not
let
him
go
that
he
must
either
stay
or
take
her
too
she
leaned
forward
piper
tom
she
said
unashamed
when
you
go
will
you
take
me
with
you
i
think
we
belong
together
you
and
i
belong
together
he
repeated
incredulously
ah
is
your
pleasure
to
mock
me
oh
my
spinner
in
the
sun
why
would
you
wish
to
hurt
me
so
tears
blinded
evelina
so
that
through
her
veil
and
in
the
night
she
could
not
see
at
all
when
the
mists
cleared
he
was
gone
xxvi
the
lifting
of
the
veil
from
afar
at
the
turn
of
night
came
the
pipes
o
pan
the
wild
mysterious
strain
which
had
first
summoned
evelina
from
pain
to
peace
at
the
sound
she
sat
up
in
bed
her
heavy
lustreless
white
hair
falling
about
her
shoulders
she
guessed
that
piper
tom
was
out
upon
the
highway
with
his
pedler
pack
strapped
to
his
sturdy
back
as
in
a
vision
she
saw
him
marching
onward
from
place
to
place
to
make
the
world
easier
for
all
women
because
a
woman
had
given
him
life
and
because
he
loved
another
woman
in
another
way
was
it
always
to
be
so
she
wondered
should
she
for
ever
thirst
while
others
drank
while
others
loved
must
she
eternally
stand
aside
unyielding
fate
confronted
her
veiled
inscrutably
but
she
guessed
that
the
veil
concealed
a
mocking
smile
out
of
her
of
agony
evelina
had
emerged
with
one
truth
whatever
is
may
not
be
right
but
it
is
the
outcome
of
deep
and
forces
with
which
our
finite
hands
may
not
meddle
the
problem
has
but
one
solution
adjustment
hedged
in
by
the
iron
bars
of
circumstance
as
surely
as
a
bird
within
his
cage
it
remains
for
the
individual
to
choose
whether
he
will
beat
his
wings
against
the
bars
until
he
dies
or
take
his
place
serenely
on
the
perch
ordained
for
him
and
sing
within
his
cage
the
bird
may
do
as
he
likes
he
may
sleep
or
eat
or
bathe
or
whet
his
beak
uselessly
against
the
cuttlebone
thrust
between
the
bars
he
may
hop
about
endlessly
and
chirp
salutations
to
other
birds
likewise
caged
or
he
may
try
his
eager
wings
in
a
flight
which
is
little
better
than
no
flight
at
all
his
cage
may
be
a
large
one
yet
if
he
explores
far
enough
he
will
most
surely
bruise
his
body
against
the
bars
of
circumstance
with
beak
and
claws
and
constant
toil
he
may
perhaps
force
an
opening
in
the
bars
wide
enough
to
get
through
slowly
and
with
great
discomfort
he
has
gained
however
only
a
larger
cage
if
he
is
a
wise
bird
he
settles
down
and
tries
to
become
satisfied
with
his
surroundings
even
to
gather
pleasure
from
the
gilt
wires
and
the
cuttlebone
thrust
picturesquely
between
them
when
the
sea
gull
wings
his
majestic
way
past
his
habitation
free
as
the
wind
itself
the
wise
bird
will
close
his
eyes
and
affect
not
to
see
so
also
will
the
gull
for
there
is
no
loneliness
comparable
with
unlimited
freedom
upon
the
heights
the
great
ones
stand
alone
to
the
dweller
in
the
valley
those
distant
peaks
are
clad
in
more
than
mortal
splendour
time
and
distance
veil
the
jagged
cliffs
and
hide
the
precipices
day
comes
first
to
the
peaks
and
lingers
there
longest
while
it
is
night
in
the
valley
there
is
still
afterglow
upon
the
hills
perhaps
some
dweller
in
the
valley
longs
for
the
height
and
sets
forth
heeding
not
the
eager
hands
that
selfishly
as
it
seems
would
keep
him
within
their
loving
reach
having
once
turned
his
face
upward
he
does
not
falter
even
for
the
space
of
a
backward
look
he
finds
that
the
way
is
steep
that
there
is
no
place
to
rest
and
that
the
comfort
and
shelter
of
the
valley
are
unknown
the
sun
burns
him
and
the
cold
freezes
his
very
blood
for
there
are
only
extremes
on
the
way
to
the
peak
glittering
wastes
of
ice
dazzle
him
and
snow
blinds
him
with
terror
and
not
with
beauty
as
from
below
the
opaline
mists
are
gone
and
he
sees
with
dreadful
clearness
the
path
which
lies
immediately
ahead
beyond
there
is
emptiness
vast
as
the
desert
at
the
timber
line
he
pauses
and
for
the
first
time
looks
back
ah
how
fair
the
valley
lies
below
him
the
silvery
ribbon
of
the
river
winds
through
a
pageantry
of
green
and
gold
upon
the
banks
are
woodland
nooks
fragrant
with
growing
things
and
filled
with
a
tender
quiet
broken
only
by
the
murmer
of
the
stream
the
turf
is
soft
and
cool
to
the
wayfarer
tired
feet
and
there
is
crystal
water
in
abundance
to
quench
his
thirst
but
from
the
peak
no
traveller
returns
for
the
way
is
hopelessly
cut
off
above
the
timber
line
there
is
only
a
waste
of
rock
worn
by
vast
centuries
in
which
every
day
is
an
ordinary
lifetime
into
small
jagged
stones
that
cut
the
feet
the
crags
are
and
blown
by
cataclysmic
storms
of
which
the
dwellers
in
the
valley
have
never
dreamed
in
the
unspeakable
loneliness
the
pilgrim
abides
for
ever
with
his
mocking
wreath
of
laurel
cheered
only
by
a
rumbling
reverberant
all
hail
which
comes
at
intervals
from
some
peak
before
whose
infinite
distance
his
finite
sight
fails
at
intervals
throughout
the
day
miss
evelina
heard
the
piper
flute
always
from
the
hills
each
time
it
brought
her
comfort
for
she
knew
that
as
yet
he
had
not
gone
once
she
fancied
that
he
had
gone
long
ago
and
some
woodland
deity
magically
transported
from
ancient
greece
had
taken
his
place
late
in
the
afternoon
she
heard
it
once
but
so
far
and
faintly
that
she
guessed
it
was
for
the
last
time
in
her
garden
there
were
flowers
blooming
luxuriantly
from
their
swaying
censers
fragrant
incense
filled
the
air
the
weeds
had
been
taken
out
and
no
trace
was
left
from
the
garden
of
her
heart
the
weeds
were
gone
too
but
there
were
no
flowers
rue
and
asphodel
had
been
replaced
by
lavender
and
rosemary
the
deadly
black
poppy
had
been
uprooted
and
where
it
had
grown
there
were
spikenard
and
balm
yet
as
the
piper
had
said
she
asked
for
roses
and
it
is
not
every
garden
in
which
roses
will
bloom
at
dusk
she
went
out
into
her
transformed
garden
where
once
the
thorns
had
held
her
back
the
paths
were
straight
and
smooth
dense
undergrowth
and
clinging
vines
no
longer
made
her
steps
difficult
piper
tom
had
made
her
garden
right
and
opened
before
her
clearly
the
way
of
her
soul
in
spite
of
the
beauty
there
was
desolation
because
the
cheery
presence
had
gone
to
return
no
more
her
loneliness
was
so
acute
that
it
was
almost
pain
and
yet
the
pain
was
bearable
because
he
had
taught
her
how
to
endure
and
to
look
beyond
the
white
moths
fluttered
through
the
garden
and
the
crickets
piped
cheerily
miss
evelina
stopped
her
ears
that
she
might
not
hear
their
piping
rude
reminder
as
it
was
of
music
that
should
come
no
more
but
even
so
she
could
not
shut
out
remembrance
with
a
flash
of
her
old
resentment
she
recalled
how
everything
upon
which
she
had
ever
depended
had
been
taken
away
from
her
almost
immediately
no
sooner
had
she
learned
the
sweetness
of
clinging
than
she
had
been
forced
to
stand
alone
one
by
one
the
supports
had
been
removed
until
she
stood
alone
desolate
and
wretched
indeed
but
alone
of
such
things
as
these
is
made
suddenly
the
still
air
seemed
to
stir
a
sound
that
was
neither
breath
nor
music
so
softly
was
it
blown
echoed
in
from
the
hills
then
came
another
and
another
merest
hints
of
melody
till
at
last
she
started
up
trembling
surely
these
distant
flutings
were
the
pipes
pan
she
set
herself
to
listen
her
tiny
hands
working
convulsively
nearer
and
nearer
the
music
came
singing
of
wind
and
stream
and
mountain
the
music
that
had
no
tune
no
sooner
had
it
become
clear
than
it
ceased
altogether
but
an
hour
or
so
afterward
when
the
moon
had
risen
there
was
a
familiar
step
upon
the
road
outside
veiled
evelina
went
to
the
gate
and
met
piper
tom
whose
red
feather
was
aloft
in
his
hat
again
and
whose
flute
was
slung
over
his
shoulder
by
its
accustomed
cord
his
pedler
pack
was
not
to
be
seen
i
thought
you
had
gone
she
said
i
had
he
answered
but
is
not
written
i
thinking
that
a
man
may
not
change
his
mind
as
well
as
a
woman
my
heart
would
not
let
my
feet
go
away
from
you
until
i
knew
for
sure
whether
or
not
you
were
mocking
me
last
night
mocking
you
no
surely
you
know
i
would
never
do
that
no
i
did
not
know
the
ways
of
women
are
strange
i
thinking
past
all
finding
out
in
truth
would
be
stranger
if
you
were
not
mocking
me
than
it
ever
could
be
if
you
were
tell
me
he
pleaded
ah
tell
me
what
you
were
meaning
in
words
so
plain
that
i
can
understand
come
said
evelina
come
to
where
we
were
sitting
last
night
and
i
will
tell
you
he
followed
her
back
to
the
maple
beside
the
broken
wall
where
the
two
chairs
still
faced
each
other
he
leaned
forward
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
looked
at
her
so
keenly
that
she
felt
in
spite
of
the
darkness
and
her
veil
that
he
must
see
her
face
piper
tom
she
said
when
you
came
to
me
i
was
the
most
miserable
woman
on
earth
i
had
been
most
cruelly
betrayed
and
sorrow
seized
upon
me
when
i
was
not
strong
enough
to
stand
it
it
preyed
upon
me
until
it
became
an
obsession
it
possessed
me
absolutely
and
from
it
there
was
no
escape
but
death
i
know
answered
the
piper
i
found
the
bottle
that
had
held
the
dreamless
sleep
i
thinking
you
had
thrown
it
away
yes
i
had
thrown
it
away
but
only
because
i
was
too
proud
to
die
at
his
door
do
you
understand
yes
i
thinking
i
understand
but
go
on
you
not
told
me
whether
or
no
you
mocked
me
what
did
you
mean
i
meant
said
evelina
steadfastly
that
if
you
cared
for
the
woman
you
had
led
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
cypress
and
for
all
that
was
in
her
heart
to
give
you
she
was
yours
not
only
out
of
gratitude
but
because
you
have
put
trust
into
a
heart
that
has
known
no
trust
since
its
betrayal
and
because
where
trust
is
there
may
some
day
come
more
her
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
but
piper
tom
heard
it
he
took
her
hand
in
his
own
and
she
felt
him
tremble
she
was
the
strong
one
now
spinner
in
the
sun
he
began
huskily
were
you
meaning
that
go
with
me
when
i
took
the
highway
again
and
help
me
make
the
world
easier
for
everybody
with
a
hurt
heart
yes
she
answered
you
called
me
and
i
came
for
always
were
you
meaning
that
you
face
the
storms
and
the
cold
with
me
and
take
no
heed
of
the
rain
that
you
live
on
the
coarse
fare
i
could
pick
up
from
day
to
day
and
never
mind
it
yes
i
meant
all
that
were
you
meaning
perhaps
that
you
make
a
home
for
me
ah
spinner
in
the
sun
it
takes
a
woman
to
make
a
home
yes
i
make
a
home
or
go
gypsying
with
you
just
as
you
chose
the
piper
laughed
with
inexpressible
tenderness
you
know
thinking
that
would
be
a
home
and
not
gypsying
that
i
not
let
you
face
anything
i
could
shield
you
from
evelina
laughed
too
a
low
sweet
laugh
yes
i
know
she
said
the
piper
turned
away
struggling
with
temptation
at
length
he
came
back
to
her
is
wrong
of
me
i
thinking
but
i
take
you
as
a
man
takes
heaven
and
we
do
the
work
together
is
as
though
i
had
risen
from
the
dead
and
the
gates
of
pearl
were
open
with
all
the
angels
of
god
beckoning
me
in
in
the
exaltation
that
was
upon
him
he
had
no
thought
of
profaning
her
by
a
touch
she
stood
apart
from
him
as
something
high
and
holy
enthroned
in
a
sacred
place
beloved
he
pleaded
will
you
be
coming
with
me
now
to
the
place
where
i
saw
you
first
is
night
now
and
then
was
day
but
thinking
the
words
are
wrong
is
day
now
with
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
all
shining
at
once
and
suns
that
i
never
saw
before
will
you
come
i
go
wherever
you
lead
me
she
answered
while
you
hold
my
hand
in
yours
i
can
never
be
afraid
they
went
through
the
night
together
taking
the
shorter
way
over
the
hills
she
stumbled
and
he
took
her
hand
his
own
still
trembling
close
your
beautiful
eyes
he
whispered
and
trust
me
to
lead
you
though
she
did
not
close
her
eyes
she
gave
herself
wholly
to
his
guidance
noting
how
he
chose
for
himself
the
rougher
places
to
give
her
the
easier
path
he
pushed
aside
the
undergrowth
before
her
lifted
her
gently
over
damp
hollows
and
led
her
around
the
stones
at
last
they
came
to
the
woods
that
opened
out
upon
the
upper
river
road
where
she
had
stood
the
day
she
had
been
splashed
with
mud
from
anthony
dexter
wheels
and
at
the
same
instant
had
heard
the
mysterious
flutings
from
afar
they
entered
near
the
hill
to
which
her
long
wandering
had
led
her
and
at
the
foot
of
it
the
piper
paused
you
have
no
fear
i
thinking
since
the
moon
makes
the
clearing
as
bright
as
day
and
i
not
be
letting
you
out
of
my
sight
i
have
a
fancy
to
stand
upon
yonder
level
place
and
call
you
as
i
called
you
once
before
only
this
time
the
heart
of
me
will
dance
to
my
own
music
for
i
know
you
be
coming
all
the
while
i
play
he
left
her
and
clambered
up
the
hill
to
the
narrow
ledge
which
sloped
back
and
was
surrounded
with
pines
he
kept
in
the
open
spaces
so
that
the
moonlight
was
always
upon
him
and
she
did
not
lose
sight
of
him
more
than
once
or
twice
and
then
only
for
a
moment
the
hill
was
not
a
high
one
and
the
ascent
was
very
gradual
within
a
few
minutes
he
had
gained
his
place
clear
and
sweet
through
the
moonlit
forest
rang
out
the
pipes
o
pan
singing
of
love
and
joy
never
before
had
the
piper
flute
given
forth
such
music
as
this
the
melody
was
as
instinctive
as
the
of
a
thrush
as
crystalline
as
a
mountain
stream
and
as
pure
as
the
snow
from
whence
the
stream
had
come
evelina
climbed
to
meet
him
her
face
and
heart
uplifted
the
silvery
notes
dropped
about
her
like
rain
as
she
ascended
strangely
glad
and
strangely
at
peace
when
she
reached
the
level
place
where
he
was
standing
his
face
illumined
with
unspeakable
joy
he
dropped
his
flute
and
opened
his
arms
my
spinner
in
the
sun
he
whispered
i
called
you
and
you
came
yes
she
answered
from
his
close
embrace
you
called
me
and
i
have
come
for
always
at
last
he
released
her
and
they
stood
facing
each
other
the
piper
was
stirred
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
last
night
i
dreamed
he
said
and
was
the
dream
that
brought
me
back
it
was
a
little
place
with
a
brook
close
by
and
almost
too
small
to
be
called
a
house
but
was
a
home
i
thinking
because
you
were
there
it
was
night
and
i
had
come
back
from
making
the
world
a
bit
easier
for
some
poor
and
you
were
standing
in
the
door
waiting
the
veil
was
gone
and
there
was
love
on
your
face
ah
i
often
dreamed
a
woman
was
waiting
for
me
so
but
because
you
hide
your
beauty
from
me
is
not
for
me
to
be
asking
more
god
knows
i
have
enough
given
me
now
since
the
first
i
known
you
were
very
beautiful
and
very
brave
i
knew
too
that
you
were
sad
that
you
had
been
through
sorrows
no
man
would
dare
to
face
i
dreamed
your
eyes
were
like
the
first
violets
of
spring
your
lips
deep
scarlet
like
the
winter
berries
and
i
know
the
wonder
of
your
hair
for
the
veil
does
not
hide
it
all
i
dreamed
your
face
was
cold
and
pure
as
if
made
from
marble
yet
tender
too
and
i
well
know
that
it
noble
past
all
words
of
mine
because
it
bears
brave
scars
i
told
you
i
would
never
ask
and
i
keep
my
word
for
i
know
well
is
not
for
the
likes
of
me
to
see
it
but
only
to
dream
think
i
asking
for
i
never
will
but
spinner
in
the
sun
because
you
said
you
would
fare
with
me
on
the
highway
and
face
the
cold
and
storm
it
gives
me
courage
to
ask
for
this
if
i
close
my
eyes
will
you
lift
your
veil
and
let
me
kiss
the
brave
scars
that
were
never
from
sin
or
shame
the
brave
scars
beloved
ah
if
you
would
let
me
only
once
kiss
the
brave
scars
evelina
laughed
a
laugh
that
was
half
a
sob
and
leaning
forward
full
into
the
moonlight
she
lifted
her
veil
for
ever
