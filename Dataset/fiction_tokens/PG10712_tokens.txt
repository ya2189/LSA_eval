the

it
was
not
a
white
jacket
but
white
enough
in
all
conscience
as
the
sequel
will
show
the
way
i
came
by
it
was
this
when
our
frigate
lay
in
callao
on
the
coast
of
last
harbour
in
the
found
myself
without
a
or
surtout
and
as
toward
the
end
of
a
three
cruise
no
could
be
had
from
the
steward
and
being
bound
for
cape
horn
some
sort
of
a
substitute
was
indispensable
i
employed
myself
for
several
days
in
manufacturing
an
outlandish
garment
of
my
own
devising
to
shelter
me
from
the
boisterous
weather
we
were
so
soon
to
encounter
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
white
duck
frock
or
rather
shirt
which
laying
on
deck
i
folded
double
at
the
bosom
and
by
then
making
a
continuation
of
the
slit
there
opened
it
as
you
would
cut
a
leaf
in
the
last
new
novel
the
gash
being
made
a
metamorphosis
took
place
transcending
any
related
by
ovid
for
presto
the
shirt
was
a
coat
coat
to
be
sure
of
a
quakerish
amplitude
about
the
skirts
with
an
infirm
collar
and
a
clumsy
fullness
about
the
wristbands
and
white
yea
white
as
a
shroud
and
my
shroud
it
afterward
came
very
near
proving
as
he
who
reads
further
will
find
but
bless
me
my
friend
what
sort
of
a
summer
jacket
is
this
in
which
to
weather
cape
horn
a
very
tasty
and
beautiful
white
linen
garment
it
may
have
seemed
but
then
people
almost
universally
sport
their
linen
next
to
their
skin
very
true
and
that
thought
very
early
occurred
to
me
for
no
idea
had
i
of
scudding
round
cape
horn
in
my
shirt
for
would
have
been
almost
scudding
under
bare
poles
indeed
so
with
many
odds
and
ends
of
socks
old
and
the
bedarned
and
bequilted
the
inside
of
my
jacket
till
it
became
all
over
stiff
and
padded
as
king
and
doublet
and
no
buckram
or
steel
hauberk
stood
up
more
stoutly
so
far
very
good
but
pray
tell
me
how
do
you
propose
keeping
out
the
rain
and
the
wet
in
this
quilted
of
yours
you
call
this
wad
of
old
patches
a
mackintosh
do
you
pretend
to
say
that
worsted
is
no
my
dear
friend
and
that
was
the
deuce
of
it
waterproof
it
was
not
no
more
than
a
sponge
indeed
with
such
recklessness
had
i
bequilted
my
jacket
that
in
a
i
became
a
universal
absorber
swabbing
the
very
bulwarks
i
leaned
against
of
a
damp
day
my
heartless
shipmates
even
used
to
stand
up
against
me
so
powerful
was
the
capillary
attraction
between
this
luckless
jacket
of
mine
and
all
drops
of
moisture
i
dripped
like
a
turkey
a
roasting
and
long
after
the
rain
storms
were
over
and
the
sun
showed
his
face
i
still
stalked
a
scotch
mist
and
when
it
was
fair
weather
with
others
alas
it
was
foul
weather
with
me
ah
me
soaked
and
heavy
what
a
burden
was
that
jacket
to
carry
about
especially
when
i
was
sent
up
aloft
dragging
myself
up
step
by
step
as
if
i
were
weighing
the
anchor
small
time
then
to
strip
and
wring
it
out
in
a
rain
when
no
hanging
back
or
delay
was
permitted
no
no
up
you
go
fat
or
lean
lambert
or
edson
never
mind
how
much
avoirdupois
you
might
weigh
and
thus
in
my
own
proper
person
did
many
showers
of
rain
reascend
toward
the
skies
in
accordance
with
the
natural
laws
but
here
be
it
known
that
i
had
been
terribly
disappointed
in
carrying
out
my
original
plan
concerning
this
jacket
it
had
been
my
intention
to
make
it
thoroughly
impervious
by
giving
it
a
coating
of
paint
but
bitter
fate
ever
overtakes
us
unfortunates
so
much
paint
had
been
stolen
by
the
sailors
in
daubing
their
overhaul
trowsers
and
tarpaulins
that
by
the
time
honest
completed
my
quiltings
the
were
banned
and
put
under
strict
lock
and
key
said
old
brush
the
captain
of
the
ye
said
he
have
any
such
then
was
my
jacket
a
padded
and
porous
one
and
in
a
dark
night
gleaming
white
as

a
flying
on
the
poop
the
captain
was
looking
to
windward
and
in
his
grand
inaccessible
cabin
the
high
and
mighty
commodore
sat
silent
and
stately
as
the
statue
of
jupiter
in
dodona
we
were
all
arrayed
in
our
best
and
our
bravest
like
strips
of
blue
sky
lay
the
pure
blue
collars
of
our
frocks
upon
our
shoulders
and
our
pumps
were
so
springy
and
playful
that
we
danced
up
and
down
as
we
dined
it
was
on
the
that
our
dinners
were
spread
all
along
between
the
guns
and
there
as
we
sat
you
would
have
thought
a
hundred
and
meadows
were
nigh
such
a
cackling
of
ducks
chickens
and
ganders
such
a
lowing
of
oxen
and
bleating
of
lambkins
penned
up
here
and
there
along
the
deck
to
provide
sea
repasts
for
the
officers
more
rural
than
naval
were
the
sounds
continually
reminding
each
son
of
the
old
paternal
homestead
in
the
green
old
clime
the
old
arching
elms
the
hill
where
we
gambolled
and
down
by
the
barley
banks
of
the
stream
where
we
bathed
hands
up
anchor
when
that
order
was
given
how
we
sprang
to
the
bars
and
heaved
round
that
capstan
every
man
a
goliath
every
tendon
a
hawser
and
round
it
spun
like
a
sphere
keeping
time
with
our
feet
to
the
time
of
the
fifer
till
the
cable
was
straight
up
and
down
and
the
ship
with
her
nose
in
the
water
and
pall
unship
your
bars
and
make

it
was
done
barmen
tierers
veerers
idlers
and
all
scrambled
up
the
ladder
to
the
braces
and
halyards
while
like
monkeys
in
the
ran
out
on
those
broad
boughs
our
yards
and
down
fell
the
sails
like
white
clouds
from
the
and
royals
and
away
we
ran
with
the
halyards
till
every
sheet
was
distended
more
to
the
bars
my
hearties
heave
hard
with
a
jerk
and
a
yerk
we
broke
ground
and
up
to
our
bows
came
several
thousand
pounds
of
old
iron
in
the
shape
of
our
ponderous
anchor

was
then
was
where
he
belonged
it
was
that
loosed
that
so
far
up

there
it

albatross

chapter
iii
a
glance
at
the
principal
divisions
into
which
a
crew
is
divided
having
just
designated
the
place
where
belonged
it
must
needs
be
related
how
came
to
belong
there
every
one
knows
that
in
merchantmen
the
seamen
are
divided
into
and
their
turn
at
the
duty
by
night
this
plan
is
followed
in
all
but
in
all
besides
this
division
there
are
others
rendered
indispensable
from
the
great
number
of
men
and
the
necessity
of
precision
and
discipline
not
only
are
particular
bands
assigned
to
the
three
but
in
getting
under
weigh
or
any
other
proceeding
requiring
all
hands
particular
men
of
these
bands
are
assigned
to
each
yard
of
the
tops
thus
when
the
order
is
given
to
loose
the
flies
to
obey
it
and
no
one
but
him
and
not
only
are
particular
bands
stationed
on
the
three
decks
of
the
ship
at
such
times
but
particular
men
of
those
bands
are
also
assigned
to
particular
duties
also
in
tacking
ship
reefing
or
to
every
man
of
a
knows
his
own
special
place
and
is
infallibly
found
there
he
sees
nothing
else
attends
to
nothing
else
and
will
stay
there
till
grim
death
or
an
epaulette
orders
him
away
yet
there
are
times
when
through
the
negligence
of
the
officers
some
exceptions
are
found
to
this
rule
a
rather
serious
circumstance
growing
out
of
such
a
case
will
be
related
in
some
future
chapter
were
it
not
for
these
regulations
a
crew
would
be
nothing
but
a
mob
more
ungovernable
stripping
the
canvas
in
a
gale
than
lord
george
tearing
down
the
lofty
house
of
lord
mansfield
but
this
is
not
all
besides
office
as
looser
of
the
when
all
hands
were
called
to
make
sail
and
besides
his
special
offices
in
tacking
ship
coming
to
anchor
etc
he
permanently
belonged
to
the
starboard
watch
one
of
the
two
primary
grand
divisions
of
the
company
and
in
this
watch
he
was
a
that
is
was
stationed
in
the
with
a
number
of
other
seamen
always
in
readiness
to
execute
any
orders
pertaining
to
the
from
above
the
for
including
the
and
below
it
to
the
deck
the
belongs
to
another
detachment
now
the
fore
main
and
of
each
and
at
sea
respectively
subdivided
into
quarter
watches
which
regularly
relieve
each
other
in
the
tops
to
which
they
may
belong
while
collectively
they
relieve
the
whole
larboard
watch
of
besides
these
topmen
who
are
always
made
up
of
active
sailors
there
are
veterans
place
is
on
the
forecastle
the
anchors
and
all
the
sails
on
the
bowsprit
being
under
their
care
they
are
an
old
set
culled
from
the
most
experienced
seamen
on
board
these
are
the
fellows
that
sing
you
bay
of
biscay
oh
and
a
sheer
hulk
lies
poor
torn
bowling
rude
boreas
blustering
railer
who
when
ashore
at
an
call
for
a
bowl
of
tar
and
a
biscuit
these
are
the
fellows
who
spin
interminable
yarns
about
decatur
hull
and
bainbridge
and
carry
about
their
persons
bits
of
ironsides
as
catholics
do
the
wood
of
the
true
cross
these
are
the
fellows
that
some
officers
never
pretend
to
damn
however
much
they
may
anathematize
others
these
are
the
fellows
that
it
does
your
soul
good
to
look
at
old
members
of
the
old
guard
grim
sea
grenadiers
who
in
tempest
time
have
lost
many
a
tarpaulin
overboard
these
are
the
fellows
whose
society
some
of
the
youngster
midshipmen
much
affect
from
whom
they
learn
their
best
seamanship
and
to
whom
they
look
up
as
veterans
if
so
be
that
they
have
any
reverence
in
their
souls
which
is
not
the
case
with
all
midshipmen
then
there
is
the
stationed
on
the
quarterdeck
who
under
the
and
attend
to
the
and
spanker
and
help
haul
the
and
other
ropes
in
the
stern
of
the
vessel
the
duties
assigned
to
the
being
comparatively
light
and
easy
and
but
little
seamanship
being
expected
from
them
they
are
composed
chiefly
of
landsmen
the
least
robust
least
hardy
and
least
of
the
crew
and
being
stationed
on
the
they
are
generally
selected
with
some
eye
to
their
personal
appearance
hence
they
are
mostly
slender
young
fellows
of
a
genteel
figure
and
gentlemanly
address
not
weighing
much
on
a
rope
but
weighing
considerably
in
the
estimation
of
all
foreign
ladies
who
may
chance
to
visit
the
ship
they
lounge
away
the
most
part
of
their
time
in
reading
novels
and
romances
talking
over
their
lover
affairs
ashore
and
comparing
notes
concerning
the
melancholy
and
sentimental
career
which
drove
young
the
navy
indeed
many
of
them
show
tokens
of
having
moved
in
very
respectable
society
they
always
maintain
a
tidy
exterior
and
express
an
abhorrence
of
the
into
which
they
are
seldom
or
never
called
to
dip
their
digits
and
pluming
themselves
upon
the
cut
of
their
trowsers
and
the
glossiness
of
their
tarpaulins
from
the
rest
of
the
company
they
acquire
the
name
of
and
then
there
are
the
always
stationed
on
the
these
haul
aft
the
fore
and
besides
being
subject
to
ignoble
duties
attending
to
the
drainage
and
sewerage
below
hatches
these
fellows
are
all
jimmy
chaps
who
never
put
foot
in
ratlin
or
venture
above
the
bulwarks
inveterate
of
with
the
hayseed
yet
in
their
hair
they
are
consigned
to
the
congenial
superintendence
of
the
and
these
are
generally
placed
amidships
on
the
of
a
frigate
between
the
fore
and
main
hatches
and
comprise
so
extensive
an
area
that
it
much
resembles
the
market
place
of
a
small
town
the
melodious
sounds
thence
issuing
continually
draw
tears
from
the
eyes
of
the
waisters
reminding
them
of
their
old
paternal
and
they
are
the
and
of
the
crew
and
he
who
is
good
for
nothing
else
is
good
enough
for
a
three
decks
and
we
come
to
a
parcel
of
troglodytes
or
who
burrow
like
rabbits
in
warrens
among
the
casks
and
cables
like
cornwall
miners
wash
off
the
soot
from
their
skins
and
they
are
all
pale
as
ghosts
unless
upon
rare
occasions
they
seldom
come
on
deck
to
sun
themselves
they
may
circumnavigate
the
world
fifty
times
and
they
see
about
as
much
of
it
as
jonah
did
in
the
belly
they
are
a
lazy
lumpish
torpid
set
and
when
going
ashore
after
a
long
cruise
come
out
into
the
day
like
terrapins
from
their
caves
or
bears
in
the
spring
from
no
one
ever
knows
the
names
of
these
fellows
after
a
three
voyage
they
still
remain
strangers
to
you
in
time
of
tempests
when
all
hands
are
called
to
save
ship
they
issue
forth
into
the
gale
like
the
mysterious
old
men
of
paris
during
the
massacre
of
the
three
days
of
september
every
one
marvels
who
they
are
and
whence
they
come
they
disappear
as
mysteriously
and
are
seen
no
more
until
another
general
commotion
such
are
the
principal
divisions
into
which
a
crew
is
divided
but
the
inferior
allotments
of
duties
are
endless
and
would
require
a

a

has
need
of
a
good
memory
and
the
more
of
an
arithmetician
he
is
the
better

was
a
long
time
rapt
in
calculations
concerning
the
various
allotted
him
by
the
otherwise

as

himself
some

to
arrange

previous
to
adding
up
all
these
numbers
moreover
must
be
well
remembered
or
woe
betide
you
consider
now
a
sailor
altogether
unused
to
the
tumult
of
a
for
the
first
time
stepping
on
board
and
given
all
these
numbers
to
recollect
already
before
hearing
them
his
head
is
half
stunned
with
the
unaccustomed
sounds
ringing
in
his
ears
which
ears
seem
to
him
like
belfries
full
of
tocsins
on
the
a
thousand
scythed
chariots
seem
passing
he
hears
the
tread
of
armed
marines
the
clash
of
cutlasses
and
curses
the
mates
whistle
round
him
like
hawks
screaming
in
a
gale
and
the
strange
noises
under
decks
are
like
volcanic
rumblings
in
a
mountain
he
dodges
sudden
sounds
as
a
raw
recruit
falling
bombs
useless
to
him
now
all
previous
circumnavigations
of

terraqueous
globe

his
arctic
antarctic

equinoctial
experiences
his

off

he
must
begin

he

nothing
greek
and
hebrew
could
not
help
him
for
the
language
he
must
learn
has
neither
grammar
nor

mark
him
as
he
advances
along
the
files
of
old
mark
his
debased
attitude
his
deprecating
gestures
his
sawney
stare
like
a
scotchman
in
london
your
merry
noble
seignors
he
is
wholly
nonplussed
and
confounded
and
when
to
crown
all
the
first
lieutenant
whose
business
it
is
to
welcome
all
and
assign
them
their
quarters
when
this
of

most
bland

oh
ye
who
think
of
cruising
in
chapter
iv
jack
chase
the
first
night
out
of
port
was
a
clear
moonlight
one
the
frigate
gliding
though
the
water
with
all
her
batteries
it
was
my
quarter
watch
in
the
top
and
there
i
reclined
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
my
whatever
the
other
seamen
might
have
been
these
were
a
noble
set
of
tars
and
well
worthy
an
introduction
to
the
reader
first
and
foremost
was
jack
chase
our
noble
first
captain
of
the
top
he
was
a
briton
and
a
tall
and
with
a
clear
open
eye
a
fine
broad
brow
and
an
abounding
beard
no
man
ever
had
a
better
heart
or
a
bolder
he
was
loved
by
the
seamen
and
admired
by
the
officers
and
even
when
the
captain
spoke
to
him
it
was
with
a
slight
air
of
respect
jack
was
a
frank
and
charming
man
no
one
could
be
better
company
in
forecastle
or
saloon
no
man
told
such
stories
sang
such
songs
or
with
greater
alacrity
sprang
to
his
duty
indeed
there
was
only
one
thing
wanting
about
him
and
that
was
a
finger
of
his
left
hand
which
finger
he
had
lost
at
the
great
battle
of
navarino
he
had
a
high
conceit
of
his
profession
as
a
seaman
and
being
deeply
versed
in
all
things
pertaining
to
a
was
universally
regarded
as
an
oracle
the
over
which
he
presided
was
a
sort
of
oracle
of
delphi
to
which
many
pilgrims
ascended
to
have
their
perplexities
or
differences
settled
there
was
such
an
abounding
air
of
good
sense
and
good
feeling
about
the
man
that
he
who
could
not
love
him
would
thereby
pronounce
himself
a
knave
i
thanked
my
sweet
stars
that
kind
fortune
had
placed
me
near
him
though
under
him
in
the
frigate
and
from
the
outset
jack
and
i
were
fast
friends
wherever
you
may
be
now
rolling
over
the
blue
billows
dear
jack
take
my
best
love
along
with
you
and
god
bless
you
wherever
you
go
jack
was
a
gentleman
what
though
his
hand
was
hard
so
was
not
his
heart
too
often
the
case
with
soft
palms
his
manners
were
easy
and
free
none
of
the
boisterousness
so
common
to
tars
and
he
had
a
polite
courteous
way
of
saluting
you
if
it
were
only
to
borrow
your
knife
jack
had
read
all
the
verses
of
byron
and
all
the
romances
of
scott
he
talked
of
rob
roy
don
juan
and
pelham
macbeth
and
ulysses
but
above
all
things
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
camoens
parts
of
the
lusiad
he
could
recite
in
the
original
where
he
had
obtained
his
wonderful
accomplishments
it
is
not
for
me
his
humble
subordinate
to
say
enough
that
those
accomplishments
were
so
various
the
languages
he
could
converse
in
so
numerous
that
he
more
than
furnished
an
example
of
that
saying
of
charles
the
he
who
speaks
five
languages
is
as
good
as
five
but
jack
he
was
better
than
a
hundred
common
mortals
jack
was
a
whole
phalanx
an
entire
army
jack
was
a
thousand
strong
jack
would
have
done
honour
to
the
queen
of
jack
must
have
been
a
of
some
british
admiral
of
the
blue
a
finer
specimen
of
the
island
race
of
englishmen
could
not
have
been
picked
out
of
westminster
abbey
of
a
coronation
day
his
whole
demeanor
was
in
strong
contrast
to
that
of
one
of
the
captains
of
the
this
man
though
a
good
seaman
furnished
an
example
of
those
insufferable
britons
who
while
preferring
other
countries
to
their
own
as
places
of
residence
still
overflow
with
all
the
pompousness
of
national
and
individual
vanity
combined
i
was
on
board
the
a
long
time
was
almost
the
invariable
exordium
to
the
most
cursory
remarks
it
is
often
the
custom
of
when
they
deem
anything
to
be
going
on
wrong
aboard
ship
to
refer
to
when
of
course
everything
was
done
and
bristol
and
by
referring
to
the
expressive
name
by
the
captain
meant
a
ship
in
the
english
navy
in
which
he
had
had
the
honour
of
serving
so
continual
were
his
allusions
to
this
craft
with
the
amiable
name
that
at
last
the
was
voted
a
bore
by
his
shipmates
and
one
hot
afternoon
during
a
calm
when
the
captain
like
many
others
was
standing
still
and
yawning
on
the
jack
chase
his
own
countryman
came
up
to
him
and
pointing
at
his
open
mouth
politely
inquired
whether
that
was
the
way
they
caught
in
her
britannic
ship
the
after
that
we
heard
no
more
of
the
craft
now
the
tops
of
a
frigate
are
quite
spacious
and
cosy
they
are
railed
in
behind
so
as
to
form
a
kind
of
balcony
very
pleasant
of
a
tropical
night
from
twenty
to
thirty
loungers
may
agreeably
recline
there
cushioning
themselves
on
old
sails
and
jackets
we
had
rare
times
in
that
top
we
accounted
ourselves
the
best
seamen
in
the
ship
and
from
our
airy
perch
literally
looked
down
upon
the
landlopers
below
sneaking
about
the
deck
among
the
guns
in
a
large
degree
we
nourished
that
feeling
of
de
always
pervading
more
or
less
the
various
sections
of
a
crew
we
were
brothers
one
and
all
and
we
loaned
ourselves
to
each
other
with
all
the
freedom
in
the
world
nevertheless
i
had
not
long
been
a
member
of
this
fraternity
of
fine
fellows
ere
i
discovered
that
jack
chase
our
captain
all
prime
favorites
and
oracles
among
little
bit
of
a
dictator
not
peremptorily
or
annoyingly
so
but
amusingly
intent
on
egotistically
mending
our
manners
and
improving
our
taste
so
that
we
might
reflect
credit
upon
our
tutor
he
made
us
all
wear
our
hats
at
a
particular
us
in
the
tie
of
our
and
protested
against
our
wearing
vulgar
trowsers
besides
giving
us
lessons
in
seamanship
and
solemnly
conjuring
us
forever
to
eschew
the
company
of
any
sailor
we
suspected
of
having
served
in
a
whaler
against
all
whalers
indeed
he
cherished
the
unmitigated
detestation
of
a
true
man
poor
tubbs
can
testify
to
that
tubbs
was
in
the
a
long
lank
vineyarder
eternally
talking
of
nantucket
sperm
oil
stove
boats
and
japan
nothing
could
silence
him
and
his
comparisons
were
ever
invidious
now
with
all
his
soul
jack
abominated
this
tubbs
he
said
he
was
vulgar
an
take
him
been
in
a
whaler
but
like
many
men
who
have
been
where
been
or
seen
what
seen
tubbs
on
account
of
his
whaling
experiences
absolutely
affected
to
look
down
upon
jack
even
as
jack
did
upon
him
and
this
it
was
that
so
enraged
our
noble
captain
one
night
with
a
peculiar
meaning
in
his
eye
he
sent
me
down
on
deck
to
invite
tubbs
up
aloft
for
a
chat
flattered
by
so
marked
an
we
were
somewhat
fastidious
and
did
not
extend
such
invitations
to
every
quickly
mounted
the
rigging
looking
rather
abashed
at
finding
himself
in
the
august
presence
of
the
assembled
of
courteous
manner
however
very
soon
relieved
his
embarrassment
but
it
is
no
use
to
be
courteous
to
men
in
this
world
tubbs
belonged
to
that
category
no
sooner
did
the
bumpkin
feel
himself
at
ease
than
he
launched
out
as
usual
into
tremendous
laudations
of
whalemen
declaring
that
whalemen
alone
deserved
the
name
of
sailors
jack
stood
it
some
time
but
when
tubbs
came
down
upon
and
particularly
upon
his
sense
of
propriety
was
so
outraged
that
he
launched
into
tubbs
like
a
pounder
you
limb
of
nantucket
you
man
you
strainer
you
bobber
after
carrion
do
pretend
to
vilify
a

as
a

and
sequestered
hamlets
the
place
for

and
commotion
the
place

be
gentlemanly
and
jolly
and
what
did
you
know
you
bumpkin
before
you
came
on
board
this
miller
what
knew
you
of
or
orlop
mustering
round
the
capstan
beating
to
quarters
and
piping
to
dinner
did
you
ever
roll
to
on
board
your
greasy
ballyhoo
of
blazes
did
you
ever
winter
at
mahon
did
you
ever
and
carry
why
what
are
even
a
sorry
yarns
of
voyages
to
china
after
and
voyages
to
the
west
indies
after
sugar
puncheons
and
voyages
to
the
shetlands
after
are
even
these
yarns
you
tubbs
you
to
high
life
in
a
why
you
i
have
sailed
with
lords
and
marquises
for
captains
and
the
king
of
the
two
sicilies
has
passed
me
as
i
here
stood
up
at
my
gun
bah
you
are
full
of
the
and
the
forecastle
you
are
only
familiar
with
burtons
and
your
ambition
never
mounted
above
which
in
my
poor
opinion
is
the
proper
phrase
for
whaling
topmates
has
not
this
tubbs
here
been
but
a
misuser
of
good
oak
planks
and
a
vile
desecrator
of
the
thrice
holy
sea
turning
his
ship
my
hearties
into
a
and
the
ocean
into
a
begone
you
graceless
godless
knave
pitch
him
over
the
top
there
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
my
exertions
poor
tubbs
astounded
at
these
fulminations
was
already
rapidly
descending
by
the
rigging
this
outburst
on
the
part
of
my
noble
friend
jack
made
me
shake
all
over
spite
of
my
padded
surtout
and
caused
me
to
offer
up
devout
thanksgivings
that
in
no
evil
hour
had
i
divulged
the
fact
of
having
myself
served
in
a
whaler
for
having
previously
marked
the
prevailing
prejudice
of
men
to
that
class
of
mariners
i
had
wisely
held
my
peace
concerning
stove
boats
on
the
coast
of
japan
chapter
jack
chase
on
a
spanish
here
i
must
frankly
tell
a
story
about
jack
which
as
touching
his
honour
and
integrity
i
am
sure
will
not
work
against
him
in
any
charitable
estimation
on
this
present
cruise
of
the
frigate
neversink
jack
had
deserted
and
after
a
certain
interval
had
been
captured
but
with
what
purpose
had
he
deserted
to
avoid
naval
discipline
to
riot
in
some
abandoned
for
love
of
some
worthless
signorita
not
at
all
he
abandoned
the
frigate
from
far
higher
and
nobler
nay
glorious
motives
though
bowing
to
naval
discipline
afloat
yet
ashore
he
was
a
stickler
for
the
rights
of
man
and
the
liberties
of
the
world
he
went
to
draw
a
partisan
blade
in
the
civil
commotions
of
peru
and
befriend
heart
and
soul
what
he
deemed
the
cause
of
the
right
at
the
time
his
disappearance
excited
the
utmost
astonishment
among
the
officers
who
had
little
suspected
him
of
any
such
conduct
of
deserting
jack
my
great
man
of
the
gone
cried
the
captain
not
believe
chase
cut
and
run
cried
a
sentimental
middy
must
have
been
all
for
love
then
the
signoritas
have
turned
his
chase
not
to
be
found
cried
a
growling
old
one
of
your
malicious
prophets
of
past
events
though
so
i
it
i
could
have
sworn
the
chap
to
make
sail
on
the
sly
i
always
months
passed
away
and
nothing
was
heard
of
jack
till
at
last
the
frigate
came
to
anchor
on
the
coast
alongside
of
a
peruvian
sloop
of
war
bravely
clad
in
the
peruvian
uniform
and
with
a
fine
mixed
martial
and
naval
step
a
tall
striking
figure
of
a
officer
was
descried
promenading
the
of
the
stranger
and
superintending
the
salutes
which
are
exchanged
between
national
vessels
on
these
occasions
this
fine
officer
touched
his
laced
hat
most
courteously
to
our
captain
who
after
returning
the
compliment
stared
at
him
rather
impolitely
through
his
heaven
he
cried
at
is
disguise
his
the
beard
know
him
in
cochin
the
first
cutter
there
lieutenant
blink
go
on
board
that
sloop
of
war
and
fetch
me
yon
all
hands
were
when
a
peace
was
between
the
united
states
and
peru
to
send
an
armed
body
on
board
a
peruvian
sloop
of
war
and
seize
one
of
its
officers
in
broad
daylight
infraction
of
the
law
of
nations
what
would
vattel
say
but
captain
claret
must
be
obeyed
so
off
went
the
cutter
every
man
armed
to
the
teeth
the
having
secret
instructions
and
the
midshipmen
attending
looking
ominously
wise
though
in
truth
they
could
not
tell
what
was
coming
gaining
the
sloop
of
war
the
lieutenant
was
received
with
the
customary
honours
but
by
this
time
the
tall
bearded
officer
had
disappeared
from
the
the
lieutenant
now
inquired
for
the
peruvian
captain
and
being
shown
into
the
cabin
made
known
to
him
that
on
board
his
vessel
was
a
person
belonging
to
the
united
states
ship
neversink
and
his
orders
were
to
have
that
person
delivered
up
instanter
the
foreign
captain
curled
his
mustache
in
astonishment
and
indignation
he
hinted
something
about
beating
to
quarters
and
chastising
this
piece
of
yankee
insolence
but
resting
one
gloved
hand
upon
the
table
and
playing
with
his
the
lieutenant
with
a
bland
firmness
repeated
his
demand
at
last
the
whole
case
being
so
plainly
made
out
and
the
person
in
question
being
so
accurately
described
even
to
a
mole
on
his
cheek
there
remained
nothing
but
immediate
compliance
so
the
bearded
officer
who
had
so
courteously
doffed
his
chapeau
to
our
captain
but
disappeared
upon
the
arrival
of
the
lieutenant
was
summoned
into
the
cabin
before
his
superior
who
addressed
him
thus
john
this
gentleman
declares
that
of
right
you
belong
to
the
frigate
neversink
is
it
so
is
even
so
don
sereno
said
jack
chase
proudly
folding
his
across
his
as
there
is
no
resisting
the
frigate
i
blink
i
am
ready
adieu
don
sereno
and
madre
de
dios
protect
you
you
have
been
a
most
gentlemanly
friend
and
captain
to
me
i
hope
you
will
yet
thrash
your
beggarly
with
that
he
turned
and
entering
the
cutter
was
pulled
back
to
the
frigate
and
stepped
up
to
captain
claret
where
that
gentleman
stood
on
the
servant
my
fine
don
said
the
captain
ironically
lifting
his
chapeau
but
regarding
jack
at
the
same
time
with
a
look
of
intense
displeasure
most
devoted
and
penitent
captain
of
the
sir
and
one
who
in
his
very
humility
of
contrition
is
yet
proud
to
call
captain
claret
his
commander
said
jack
making
a
glorious
bow
and
then
tragically
flinging
overboard
his
peruvian
sword
him
at
once
shouted
captain
now
sir
to
your
duty
and
discharge
that
well
to
the
end
of
the
cruise
and
you
will
hear
no
more
of
your
having
run
so
jack
went
forward
among
crowds
of
admiring
tars
who
swore
by
his
beard
which
had
amazingly
lengthened
and
spread
during
his
absence
they
divided
his
laced
hat
and
coat
among
them
and
on
their
shoulders
carried
him
in
triumph
along
the
chapter
vi
the
officers
warrant
officers
and
underlings
of
a
where
they
live
in
the
ship
how
they
live
their
social
standing
on
and
what
sort
of
gentlemen
they
are
some
account
has
been
given
of
the
various
divisions
into
which
our
crew
was
divided
so
it
may
be
well
to
say
something
of
the
officers
who
they
are
and
what
are
their
functions
our
ship
be
it
know
was
the
that
is
we
sported
a
or
at
the
main
in
token
that
we
carried
a
highest
rank
of
officers
recognised
in
the
american
navy
the
bougee
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
or
a
tapering
serpentine
streamer
worn
by
all
owing
to
certain
vague
republican
scruples
about
creating
great
officers
of
the
navy
america
has
thus
far
had
no
admirals
though
as
her
ships
of
war
increase
they
may
become
indispensable
this
will
assuredly
be
the
case
should
she
ever
have
occasion
to
employ
large
fleets
when
she
must
adopt
something
like
the
english
plan
and
introduce
three
or
four
grades
of
above
a
and
of
squadrons
distinguished
by
the
color
of
their
flags
white
and
blue
corresponding
to
the
centre
van
and
rear
these
rank
respectively
with
generals
and
in
the
army
just
as
commodore
takes
rank
with
a
so
that
the
same
prejudice
which
prevents
the
american
government
from
creating
admirals
should
have
precluded
the
creation
of
all
army
officers
above
a
brigadier
an
american
commodore
like
an
english
commodore
or
the
french
is
but
a
senior
captain
temporarily
commanding
a
small
number
of
ships
detached
for
any
special
purpose
he
has
no
permanent
rank
recognised
by
government
above
his
captaincy
though
once
employed
as
a
commodore
usage
and
courtesy
unite
in
continuing
the
title
our
commodore
was
a
gallant
old
man
who
had
seen
service
in
his
time
when
a
lieutenant
he
served
in
the
late
war
with
england
and
in
the
actions
on
the
lakes
near
new
orleans
just
previous
to
the
grand
land
engagements
received
a
in
his
shoulder
which
with
the
two
balls
in
his
eyes
he
carries
about
with
him
to
this
day
often
when
i
looked
at
the
venerable
old
warrior
doubled
up
from
the
effect
of
his
wound
i
thought
what
a
curious
as
well
as
painful
sensation
it
must
be
to
have
shoulder
a
though
sooth
to
say
so
many
of
us
civilised
mortals
convert
our
mouths
into
golcondas
on
account
of
this
wound
in
his
shoulder
our
commodore
had
a
pay
allowed
him
in
addition
to
his
regular
salary
i
can
not
say
a
great
deal
personally
of
the
commodore
he
never
sought
my
company
at
all
never
extended
any
gentlemanly
courtesies
but
though
i
can
not
say
much
of
him
personally
i
can
mention
something
of
him
in
his
general
character
as
a
in
the
first
place
then
i
have
serious
doubts
whether
for
the
most
part
he
was
not
dumb
for
in
my
hearing
he
seldom
or
never
uttered
a
word
and
not
only
did
he
seem
dumb
himself
but
his
presence
possessed
the
strange
power
of
making
other
people
dumb
for
the
time
his
appearance
on
the
seemed
to
give
every
officer
the
another
phenomenon
about
him
was
the
strange
manner
in
which
everyone
shunned
him
at
the
first
sign
of
those
epaulets
of
his
on
the
weather
side
of
the
poop
the
officers
there
congregated
invariably
shrunk
over
to
leeward
and
left
him
alone
perhaps
he
had
an
evil
eye
may
be
he
was
the
wandering
jew
afloat
the
real
reason
probably
was
that
like
all
high
functionaries
he
deemed
it
indispensable
religiously
to
sustain
his
dignity
one
of
the
most
troublesome
things
in
the
world
and
one
calling
for
the
greatest
and
the
constant
watch
and
guardedness
which
this
sustaining
of
a
dignity
requires
plainly
enough
shows
that
apart
from
the
common
dignity
of
manhood
commodores
in
general
possess
no
real
dignity
at
all
true
it
is
expedient
for
crowned
heads
generalissimos
and
commodores
to
carry
themselves
straight
and
beware
of
the
spinal
complaint
but
it
is
not
the
less
veritable
that
it
is
a
piece
of
assumption
exceedingly
uncomfortable
to
themselves
and
ridiculous
to
an
enlightened
generation
now
how
many
rare
good
fellows
there
were
among
us
who
invited
into
his
cabin
over
a
social
bottle
or
two
would
have
rejoiced
our
old
heart
and
caused
that
ancient
wound
of
his
to
heal
up
at
once
come
come
commodore
look
so
sour
old
boy
step
up
aloft
here
into
the
and
spin
you
a
sociable
yarn
truly
i
thought
myself
much
happier
in
that
white
jacket
of
mine
than
our
old
commodore
in
his
dignified
epaulets
one
thing
perhaps
that
more
than
anything
else
helped
to
make
our
commodore
so
melancholy
and
forlorn
was
the
fact
of
his
having
so
little
to
do
for
as
the
frigate
had
a
captain
of
course
so
far
as
was
concerned
our
commodore
was
a
supernumerary
what
abundance
of
leisure
he
must
have
had
during
a
three
cruise
how
indefinitely
he
might
have
been
improving
his
mind
but
as
everyone
knows
that
idleness
is
the
hardest
work
in
the
world
so
our
commodore
was
specially
provided
with
a
gentleman
to
assist
him
this
gentleman
was
called
the
he
was
a
remarkably
urbane
and
polished
man
with
a
very
graceful
exterior
and
looked
much
like
an
ambassador
extraordinary
from
versailles
he
messed
with
the
lieutenants
in
the
where
he
had
a
elegantly
furnished
as
the
private
cabinet
of
pelham
his
used
to
entertain
the
sailors
with
all
manner
of
stories
about
the
flutes
and
flageolets
fine
oil
paintings
morocco
bound
volumes
chinese
gold
enamelled
pencil
cases
extraordinary
fine
french
boots
with
soles
no
thicker
than
a
sheet
of
scented
embroidered
vests
alabaster
statuettes
of
venus
and
adonis
inlaid
and
combs
and
a
hundred
other
luxurious
appendages
scattered
about
this
magnificent
i
was
a
long
time
in
finding
out
what
this
duties
comprised
but
it
seemed
he
wrote
the
dispatches
for
washington
and
also
was
his
general
amanuensis
nor
was
this
a
very
light
duty
at
times
for
some
commodores
though
they
do
not
a
great
deal
on
board
ship
yet
they
have
a
vast
deal
to
write
very
often
the
regimental
orderly
stationed
at
our
would
touch
his
hat
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
with
a
mysterious
air
hand
him
a
note
i
always
thought
these
notes
must
contain
most
important
matters
of
state
until
one
day
seeing
a
slip
of
wet
torn
paper
in
a
i
read
the
following
you
will
give
the
people
pickles
with
their
fresh
meat
lieutenant
bridewell
command
of
the
commodore
dashman
priv
this
was
a
new
revelation
for
from
his
almost
immutable
reserve
i
had
supposed
that
the
commodore
never
meddled
immediately
with
the
concerns
of
the
ship
but
left
all
that
to
the
captain
but
the
longer
we
live
the
more
we
learn
of
commodores
turn
we
now
to
the
second
officer
in
rank
almost
supreme
however
in
the
internal
affairs
of
his
ship
captain
claret
was
a
large
portly
man
a
harry
the
eighth
afloat
bluff
and
hearty
and
as
kingly
in
his
cabin
as
harry
on
his
throne
for
a
ship
is
a
bit
of
terra
firma
cut
off
from
the
main
it
is
a
state
in
itself
and
the
captain
is
its
king
it
is
no
limited
monarchy
where
the
sturdy
commons
have
a
right
to
petition
and
snarl
if
they
please
but
almost
a
despotism
like
the
grand
the
word
is
law
he
never
speaks
but
in
the
imperative
mood
when
he
stands
on
his
at
sea
he
absolutely
commands
as
far
as
eye
can
reach
only
the
moon
and
stars
are
beyond
his
jurisdiction
he
is
lord
and
master
of
the
sun
it
is
not
twelve
till
he
says
so
for
when
the
whose
duty
it
is
to
take
the
regular
observation
at
noon
touches
his
hat
and
reports
twelve
to
the
officer
of
the
deck
that
functionary
orders
a
midshipman
to
repair
to
the
cabin
and
humbly
inform
him
of
the
respectful
suggestion
of
the
reported
sir
says
the
middy
it
so
replies
the
captain
and
the
bell
is
struck
eight
by
the
and
twelve
it
is
as
in
the
case
of
the
commodore
when
the
captain
visits
the
deck
his
subordinate
officers
generally
beat
a
retreat
to
the
other
side
and
as
a
general
rule
would
no
more
think
of
addressing
him
except
concerning
the
ship
than
a
lackey
would
think
of
hailing
the
czar
of
russia
on
his
throne
and
inviting
him
to
tea
perhaps
no
mortal
man
has
more
reason
to
feel
such
an
intense
sense
of
his
own
personal
consequence
as
the
captain
of
a
at
sea
next
in
rank
comes
the
first
or
senior
lieutenant
the
chief
executive
officer
i
have
no
reason
to
love
the
particular
gentleman
who
filled
that
post
aboard
our
frigate
for
it
was
he
who
refused
my
petition
for
as
much
black
paint
as
would
render
that
of
mine
all
my
soakings
and
drenchings
lie
at
his
door
i
hardly
think
i
shall
ever
forgive
him
every
twinge
of
the
rheumatism
which
i
still
occasionally
feel
is
directly
referable
to
him
the
immortals
have
a
reputation
for
clemency
and
may
pardon
him
but
he
must
not
dun
me
to
be
merciful
but
my
personal
feelings
toward
the
man
shall
not
prevent
me
from
here
doing
him
justice
in
most
things
he
was
an
excellent
seaman
prompt
loud
and
to
the
point
and
as
such
was
well
fitted
for
his
station
the
first
lieutenancy
of
a
frigate
demands
a
good
disciplinarian
and
every
way
an
energetic
man
by
the
captain
he
is
held
responsible
for
everything
by
that
magnate
indeed
he
is
supposed
to
be
omnipresent
down
in
the
hold
and
up
aloft
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
presides
at
the
head
of
the
table
who
are
so
called
from
their
messing
together
in
a
part
of
the
ship
thus
designated
in
a
frigate
it
comprises
the
after
part
of
the
sometimes
it
goes
by
the
name
of
the
but
oftener
is
called
the
within
this
much
resembles
a
long
wide
corridor
in
a
large
hotel
numerous
doors
opening
on
both
hands
to
the
private
apartments
of
the
officers
i
never
had
a
good
interior
look
at
it
but
once
and
then
the
chaplain
was
seated
at
the
table
in
the
centre
playing
chess
with
the
lieutenant
of
marines
it
was
but
the
place
was
lighted
by
lamps
besides
the
first
lieutenant
the
officers
include
the
junior
lieutenants
in
a
frigate
six
or
seven
in
number
the
purser
chaplain
surgeon
marine
officers
and
schoolmaster
or
they
generally
form
a
very
agreeable
club
of
good
fellows
from
their
diversity
of
character
admirably
calculated
to
form
an
agreeable
social
whole
the
lieutenants
discuss
and
tell
anecdotes
of
lord
nelson
and
lady
hamilton
the
marine
officers
talk
of
storming
fortresses
and
the
siege
of
gibraltar
the
purser
steadies
this
wild
conversation
by
occasional
allusions
to
the
rule
of
three
the
professor
is
always
charged
with
a
scholarly
reflection
or
an
apt
line
from
the
classics
generally
ovid
the
stories
of
the
judiciously
serve
to
suggest
the
mortality
of
the
whole
party
as
men
while
the
good
chaplain
stands
ready
at
all
times
to
give
them
pious
counsel
and
consolation
of
course
these
gentlemen
all
associate
on
a
footing
of
perfect
social
equality
next
in
order
come
the
warrant
or
forward
officers
consisting
of
the
boatswain
gunner
carpenter
and
sailmaker
though
these
worthies
sport
long
coats
and
wear
the
yet
in
the
estimation
of
the
officers
they
are
not
technically
speaking
rated
gentlemen
the
first
lieutenant
chaplain
or
surgeon
for
example
would
never
dream
of
inviting
them
to
dinner
in
sea
parlance
come
in
at
the
hawse
holes
they
have
hard
hands
and
the
carpenter
and
practically
understand
the
duties
which
they
are
called
upon
to
superintend
they
mess
by
themselves
invariably
four
in
number
they
never
have

midshipmen
these
boys
are
sent
to
sea
for
the
purpose
of
making
commodores

in
order
to
become
commodores
many
of
them
deem
it
indispensable
forthwith
to
commence
chewing
tobacco
drinking
brandy
and
water
and
swearing
at
the
sailors
as
they
are
only
placed
on
board
a
ship
to
go
to
school
and
learn
the
duty
of
a
lieutenant

until
qualified
to
act
as
such
have

or
no
special
functions
to
attend
to
they
are
little
more
while
midshipmen
than
supernumeraries
on
board
hence
in
a
crowded
frigate
they
are
so
everlastingly
crossing
the
path
of
both
men
and
officers
that
in
the
navy
it
has
become
a
proverb
that
a
useless
fellow
is
much
in
the
way
as
a
in
a
gale
of
wind
when
all
hands
are
called
and
the
deck
swarms
with
men
the
little
running
about
distracted
and
having
nothing
particular
to
do
make
it
up
in
vociferous
swearing
exploding
all
about
under
foot
like
torpedoes
some
of
them
are
terrible
little
boys
cocking
their
cups
at
alarming
angles
and
looking
fierce
as
young
roosters
they
are
generally
great
consumers
of
macassar
oil
and
the
balm
of
columbia
they
thirst
and
rage
after
whiskers
and
sometimes
applying
their
ointments
lay
themselves
out
in
the
sun
to
promote
the
fertility
of
their
chins
as
the
only
way
to
learn
to
command
is
to
learn
to
obey
the
usage
of
a
ship
of
war
is
such
that
the
midshipmen
are
constantly
being
ordered
about
by
the
lieutenants
though
without
having
assigned
them
their
particular
destinations
they
are
always
going
somewhere
and
never
arriving
in
some
things
they
almost
have
a
harder
time
of
it
than
the
seamen
themselves

are
messengers

their

officer
of

forward
pert

his
hat
and
remains
in
an
attitude
of
deferential
suspense
and
tell
the
boatswain

with
this
perilous
errand
the
middy
hurries
away
looking
proud
as
a
king
the
middies
live
by
themselves
in
the
steerage
where
nowadays
they
dine
off
a
table
spread
with
a
cloth
they
have
a
castor
at
dinner
they
have
some
other
little
boys
selected
from
the
company
to
wait
upon
them
they
sometimes
drink
coffee
out
of
china
but
for
all
these
their
modern
refinements
in
some
instances
the
affairs
of
their
club
go
sadly
to
rack
and
ruin
the
china
is
broken
the
japanned
dented
like
a
pewter
mug
in
an
the
pronged
forks
resemble
for
which
they
are
sometimes
used

are
hacked
into
and
the
cloth
goes
to
the

patched
indeed
they
are
something
like
collegiate
freshmen
and
sophomores
living
in
the
college
buildings
especially
so
far
as
the
noise
they
make
in
their
quarters
is
concerned
the
steerage
buzzes
hums
and
swarms
like
a
hive
or
like
an
of
a
hot
day
when
the
falls
asleep
with
a
fly
on
her
nose
in
frigates
the
retreat
of
the
adjoining
the
steerage
is
on
the
same
deck
with
it
frequently
when
the
middies
waking
early
of
a
morning
as
most
youngsters
do
would
be
kicking
up
their
heels
in
their
hammocks
or
running
about
with
playing
tag
among
the
the
senior
lieutenant
would
burst
among
them
with
gentlemen
i
am
astonished
you
must
stop
this
pert
what
are
you
doing
at
the
table
there
without
your
pantaloons
to
your
hammock
sir
let
me
see
no
more
of
this
if
you
disturb
the
again
young
gentleman
you
shall
hear
of
and
so
saying
this
senior
lieutenant
would
retire
to
his
cot
in
his
like
the
father
of
a
numerous
family
after
getting
up
in
his
and
slippers
to
quiet
a
daybreak
tumult
in
his
populous
nursery
having
now
descended
from
commodore
to
middy
we
come
lastly
to
a
set
of
nondescripts
forming
also
a
by
themselves
apart
from
the
seamen
into
this
mess
the
usage
of
a

various
the
steward
corporals
marine
sergeants
and
yeomen
forming
the
first
aristocracy
above
the
sailors
the
is
a
sort
of
high
constable
and
wearing
clothes
and
known
by
his
official
rattan
he
it
is
whom
all
sailors
hate
his
is
the
universal
duty
of
a
universal
informer
and
of

on

spying
out
all
made
by
the
various
cooks
of
the
messes
and
driving
the
laggards
up
the
hatches
when
all
hands
are
called
it
is
indispensable
that
he
should
be
a
very
vidocq
in
vigilance
but
as
it
is
a
heartless
so
is
it
a
thankless
office
of
dark
nights
most
keep
themselves
in
readiness
to
dodge
pound
balls
dropped
down
the
hatchways
near
them
the
corporals
are
this
deputies
and
ushers
the
marine
sergeants
are
generally
tall
fellows
with
unyielding
spines
and
stiff
upper
lips
and
very
exclusive
in
their
tastes
and
predilections
the
yeoman

a
gentleman
who
has
a
sort
of

a

in
the
more
will
be
said
of
him
anon
except
the
officers
above
enumerated
there
are
none
who
mess
apart
from
the
seamen
the
so
called
that
is
the
and
mates
the
captains
of
the
tops
of

of

of

main

the
all

in
common
with
the
crew
and
in
the
american
navy
are
only
distinguished
from
the
common
seamen
by
their
slightly
additional
pay
but
in
the
english
navy
they
wear
crowns
and
anchors
worked
on
the
sleeves
of
their
jackets
by
way
of
badges
of
office
in
the
french
navy
they
are
known
by
strips
of
worsted
worn
in
the
same
place
like
those
designating
the
sergeants
and
corporals
in
the
army
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
is
the
criterion
of
rank
in
our
world
the
commodore
dines
alone
because
he
is
the
only
man
of
his
rank
in
the
ship
so
too
with
the
captain
and
the
officers

officers
midshipmen
the

and
the
common
seamen
of

together

they
are

on

footing
of
equality

breakfast
dinner
and
supper
not
only
is
the
a
criterion
of
rank
on
board
a
but
also
the
dinner
hour
he
who
dines
latest
is
the
greatest
man
and
he
who
dines
earliest
is
accounted
the
least
in
a
the
commodore
generally
dines
about
four
or
five
the
captain
about
three
the
lieutenants
about
two

by
which
phrase
the
common
seamen
are
specially
designated
in
the
nomenclature
of
the
sit
down
to
their
salt
beef
exactly
at
noon
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
while
the
two
estates

at
rather
patrician
thereby
in
the
long
run
impair
their

or
keep

keeping
up
the
good
elizabethan
dinner
hour
of
twelve
twelve
it
is
the
natural
centre
and
very
heart
of
the
day
at
that
hour
the
sun
has
arrived
at
the
top
of
his
hill
and
as
he
seems
to
hang
poised
there
a
while
before
coming
down
on
the
other
side
it
is
but
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
is
then
stopping
to
dine
setting
an
eminent
example
to
all
mankind
the
rest
of
the
day
is
called
the
very
sound
of
which
fine
old
saxon
word
conveys
a
feeling
of
the
lee
bulwarks
and
a
nap
a
summer
breezes
creeping
over
it
dreamy
dolphins
gliding
in
the
distance
the
word
implies
that
it
is
an
coming
after
the
grand
drama
of
the
day
something
to
be
taken
leisurely
and
lazily
but
how
can
this
be
if
you
dine
at
five
for
after
all
though
paradise
lost
be
a
noble
poem
and
we
men
no
doubt
largely
partake
in
the
immortality
of
the
immortals
yet
let
us
candidly
confess
it
shipmates
that
upon
the
whole
our
dinners
are
the
most
momentous
attains
of
these
lives
we
lead
beneath
the
moon
what
were
a
day
without
a
dinner
a
dinnerless
day
such
a
day
had
better
be
a
night
again
twelve
is
the
natural
hour
for
us
men
to
dine
because
at
that
hour
the
very
we
have
invented
arrive
at
their
terminus
they
can
get
no
further
than
twelve
when
straightway
they
continue
their
old
rounds
again
doubtless
adam
and

dined
at
twelve
and
the
patriarch
abraham
in
the
midst
of
his
cattle
and
old
job
with
his
noon
mowers
and
reapers
in
that
grand
plantation
of
uz
and
old
noah
himself
in
the
ark
must
have
gone
to
dinner
at
precisely
noon
with
all
his
floating
families
and
but
though
this
antediluvian
dinner
hour
is
rejected
by
modern
commodores
and
captains
it
still
lingers
among
under
their
command
many
sensible
things
banished
from
high
life
find
an
asylum
among
the
mob
some
commodores
are
very
particular
in
seeing
to
it
that
no
man
on
board
the
ship
dare
to
dine
after
his
the
own
dessert
is
cleared
even
the
captain
it
is
said
on
good
authority
that
a
captain
once
ventured
to
dine
at
five
when
the
hour
was
four
next
day
as
the
story
goes
that
captain
received
a
private
note
and
in
consequence
of
that
note
dined
for
the
future
at
three
though
in
respect
of
the
dinner
hour
on
board
a
have
no
reason
to
complain
yet
they
have
just
cause
almost
for
mutiny
in
the
outrageous
hours
assigned
for
their
breakfast
and
supper
eight
for
breakfast
twelve
for
dinner
four
for
supper
and
no
meals
but
these
no
lunches
and
no
cold
snacks
owing
to
this
arrangement
and
partly
to
one
watch
going
to
their
meals
before
the
other
at
sea
all
the
meals
of
the
hours
are
crowded
into
a
space
of
less
than
eight
sixteen
mortal
hours
elapse
between
supper
and
breakfast
including
to
one
watch
eight
hours
on
deck
this
is
barbarous
any
physician
will
tell
you
so
think
of
it
before
the
commodore
has
dined
you
have
supped
and
in
high
latitudes
in
you
have
taken
your
last
meal
for
the
day

five
hours
or
more
daylight

spare

of
the
navy
in
the
name
of
you
should
interpose
in
this
matter
many
a
time
have
i
a
found
myself
actually
faint
of
a
tempestuous
morning
watch
when
all
my
energies
were
to
this
miserable
unphilosophical
mode
of
allotting
the
government
meals
at
sea
we
beg
you
secretary
not
to
be
swayed
in
this
matter
by
the
honourable
board
of
commodores
who
will
no
doubt
tell
you
that
eight
twelve
and
four
are
the
proper
hours
for
to
take
their
meals
inasmuch
as
at
these
hours
the
watches
are
relieved
for
though
this
arrangement
makes
a
neater
and
cleaner
thing
of
it
for
the
officers
and
looks
very
nice
and
superfine
on
paper
yet
it
is
plainly
detrimental
to
health
and
in
time
of
war
is
attended
with
still
more
serious
consequences
to
the
whole
nation
at
large
if
the
necessary
researches
were
made
it
would
perhaps
be
found
that
in
those
instances
where
adopting
the
hours
for
meals
have
encountered
an
enemy
at
night
they
have
pretty
generally
been
beaten
that
is
in
those
cases
where
the
meal
times
were
reasonable
which
is
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
of
the
beaten
vessels
were
fighting
on
an
empty
stomach
instead
of

us
now
descend
to
specialities

to
two
of

junior
lieutenants

of

of

were
several

from
these
the
extremes
of
character
to
be
found
in
their
nature
of
the
other
officers
of
their
grade
in
the
neversink
must
be
derived
one
of
these
two
lords
went
among
the
sailors
by
a
name
of
their
own
of
course
it
was
intended
to
be
characteristic
and
even
so
it
was
in
frigates
and
all
large
ships
of

getting
under

to
carry
the

of
the

to

may
be

ponderous

keep

to

that
may
be
rapidly
wound
round

so
as
to
bind
them
together
the
article
used

called

what
could
be
better

to
the
purpose
it
is
a
slender

of

prepared
with
much
solicitude

and
wreathes
and

round
the
cable

twisted

of

the
exact
type
and
symbol
of
a
tall
genteel

spiralising
exquisite
so
much
for
the
derivation
of
the
name
which
the
sailors
applied
to
the

but
deferentially
inquire
in
plain
prose
selvagee
was
one
of
those
officers
whom
the
sight
of
a
naval
coat
had
captivated
in
the
days
of
his
youth
he
fancied
that
if
a
dressed
well
and
conversed
genteelly
he
would
abundantly
uphold
the
honour
of
his
flag
and
immortalise
the
tailor
that
made
him

rock
many
young

not
enough
to
sport
a
coat
fashioned
by
a
stultz
it
is
not
enough
to
be
well
braced
with
straps
and
suspenders
it
is
not
enough
to
have
sweet
reminiscences
of
lauras
and
matildas
it
is
a
right
down
life
of
hard
wear
and
tear
and
the
man
who
is
not
in
a
good
degree
fitted
to
become
a
common
sailor
will
never
make
an
officer
take
that
to
heart
all
ye
naval
aspirants
thrust
your
arms
up
to
the
elbow
in
pitch
and
see
how
you
like
it
ere
you
solicit

warrant
prepare
for
white

living
gales
and
typhoons
read
accounts
of
shipwrecks
and
horrible
disasters
peruse
the
narratives
of

and
bligh
familiarise
yourselves
with
the
story
of
the
english
frigate
alceste
and
the
french
frigate

though
you
may
go
ashore
now
and
then
at
cadiz
and
palermo
for
every
day
so
spent
among
oranges
and
ladies
you
will
have
whole
months
of
rains
and
gales
and
even
thus
did
selvagee
prove
it
but
with
all
the
intrepid
effeminacy
of
your
true
dandy
he
still
continued
his
baths
and
sported
his
handkerchiefs
in
the
very
teeth
of
a
tempest
alas
selvagee
there
was
no
getting
the
lavender
out
of
you
but
selvagee
was
no
fool
theoretically
he
understood
his
profession
but
the
mere
theory
of
seamanship
forms
but
the
thousandth
part
of
what
makes
a
seaman
you
can
not
save
a
ship
by
working
out
a
problem
in
the
cabin
the
deck
is
the
field
of
action
well
aware
of
his
deficiency
in
some
things
selvagee
never
took
the
is
the
badge
of
the
deck
officer
for
the
a
tremulous
movement
of
the
lip
and
an
earnest
inquiring
eye
to
the
windward
he
encouraged
those
old
tritons
the
to
discourse
with
him
concerning
the
likelihood
of
a
squall
and
often
followed
their
advice
as
to
taking
in
or
making
sail
the
smallest
favours
in
that
way
were
thankfully
received
sometimes
when
all
the
north
looked
unusually
lowering
by
many
conversational
blandishments
he
would
endeavour
to
prolong
his
stay
on
deck
after
that
watch
had
expired
but
in
fine
steady
weather
when
the
captain
would
emerge
from
his
cabin
selvagee
might
be
seen
pacing
the
poop
with
long
bold
indefatigable
strides
and
casting
his
eye
up
aloft
with
the
most
ostentatious
fidelity
but
vain
these
pretences
he
could
not
deceive
selvagee
you
know
very
well
that
if
it
comes
on
to
blow
pretty
hard
the
first
lieutenant
will
be
sure
to
interfere
with
his
paternal
authority
every
man
and
every
boy
in
the
frigate
knows
selvagee
that
you
are
no
neptune
how
unenviable
his
situation
his
brother
officers
do
not
insult
him
to
be
sure
but
sometimes
their
looks
are
as
daggers
the
sailors
do
not
laugh
at
him
outright
but
of
dark
nights
they
jeer
when
they
hearken
to
that
voice
ordering
strong
pull
at
the
main
or
by
the
halyards
sometimes
by
way
of
being
terrific
and
making
the
men
jump
selvagee
raps
out
an
oath
but
the
soft
bomb
stuffed
with
kisses
seems
to
burst
like
a
crushed
diffusing
its
odours
selvagee
selvagee
take
a
advice
and
this
cruise
over
never
more
tempt
the
sea
with
this
gentleman
of
cravats
and
curling
irons
how
strongly
contrasts
the
man
who
was
born
in
a
gale
for
in
some
time
of
cape
horn
or
must
have
entered
the
things
have
with
a
silver
spoon
but
with
a
in
his
mouth
wrapped
up
in
a
caul
as
in
a
a
charmed
life
against
shipwrecks
he
crying
luff
you
may

ho
i
am
mad
jack
is
in
his
saddle
on
the
sea
is
his
home
he
would
not
care
much
if
another
flood
came
and
overflowed
the
dry
land
for
what
would
it
do
but
float
his
good
ship
higher
and
higher
and
carry
his
proud
flag
round
the
globe
over
the
very
capitals
of
all
hostile
states
then
would
masts
surmount
spires
and
all
mankind
like
the
chinese
boatmen
in
canton
river
live
in
flotillas
and
fleets
and
find
their
food
in
the
sea
mad
jack
was
expressly
created
and
labelled
for
a
tar
five
feet
nine
is
his
mark
in
his
socks
and
not
weighing
over
eleven
stone
before
dinner
like
so
many
shrouds
his
muscles
and
tendons
are
all
set
true
trim
and
taut
he
is
braced
up
fore
and
aft
like
a
ship
on
the
wind
his
broad
chest
is
a
bulkhead
that
dams
off
the
gale
and
his
nose
is
an
aquiline
that
divides
it
in
two
like
a
keel
his
loud
lusty
lungs
are
two
belfries
full
of
all
manner
of
chimes
but
you
only
hear
his
deepest
bray
in
the
height
of
some
the
great
bell
of
which
only
sounds
when
the
king
or
the
devil
is
dead
look
at
him
there
where
he
stands
on
the
foot
on
the
rail
and
one
hand
on
a
head
thrown
back
and
his
trumpet
like
an
trunk
thrown
up
in
the
air
is
he
going
to
shoot
dead
with
sounds
those
fellows
on
the
mad
jack
was
a
bit
of
a
all
good
officers
the
sailors
loved
him
all
round
and
would
much
rather
stand
fifty
watches
with
him
than
one
with
a
sailor
but
mad
jack
alas
has
one
fearful
failing
he
drinks
and
so
do
we
all
but
mad
jack
only
drinks
brandy
the
vice
was
inveterate
surely
like
ferdinand
count
fathom
he
must
have
been
suckled
at
a
puncheon
very
often
this
bad
habit
got
him
into
very
serious
scrapes
twice
was
he
put
off
duty
by
the
commodore
and
once
he
came
near
being
broken
for
his
frolics
so
far
as
his
efficiency
as
a
was
concerned
on
shore
at
least
jack
might
as
much
as
he
pleased
but
afloat
it
will
not
do
at
all
now
if
he
only
followed
the
wise
example
set
by
those
ships
of
the
desert
the
camels
and
while
in
port
drank
for
the
thirst
past
the
thirst
present
and
the
thirst
to
that
he
might
cross
the
ocean
sober
mad
jack
would
get
along
pretty
well
still
better
if
he
would
but
eschew
brandy
altogether
and
only
drink
of
the
limpid
of
the
rills
and
the
brooks
chapter
ix
of
the
pockets
that
were
in
the
jacket
i
must
make
some
further
mention
of
that
white
jacket
of
mine
and
here
be
it
way
of
introduction
to
what
is
to
to
a
common
sailor
the
living
on
board
a
is
like
living
in
a
market
where
you
dress
on
the
and
sleep
in
the
cellar
no
privacy
can
you
have
hardly
one
seclusion
it
is
almost
a
physical
impossibility
that
you
can
ever
be
alone
you
dine
at
a
vast
sleep
in
commons
and
make
your
toilet
where
and
when
you
can
there
is
no
calling
for
a
mutton
chop
and
a
pint
of
claret
by
yourself
no
selecting
of
chambers
for
the
night
no
hanging
of
pantaloons
over
the
back
of
a
chair
no
ringing
your
bell
of
a
rainy
morning
to
take
your
coffee
in
bed
it
is
something
like
life
in
a
large
manufactory
the
bell
strikes
to
dinner
and
hungry
or
not
you
must
dine
your
clothes
are
stowed
in
a
large
canvas
bag
generally
painted
black
which
you
can
get
out
of
the
only
once
in
the
hours
and
then
during
a
time
of
the
utmost
confusion
among
five
hundred
other
bags
with
five
hundred
other
sailors
diving
into
each
in
the
midst
of
the
twilight
of
the
in
some
measure
to
obviate
this
inconvenience
many
sailors
divide
their
wardrobes
between
their
hammocks
and
their
bags
stowing
a
few
frocks
and
trowsers
in
the
former
so
that
they
can
shift
at
night
if
they
wish
when
the
hammocks
are
piped
down
but
they
gain
very
little
by
this
you
have
no
place
whatever
but
your
bag
or
hammock
in
which
to
put
anything
in
a
if
you
lay
anything
down
and
turn
your
back
for
a
moment
ten
to
one
it
is
gone
now
in
sketching
the
preliminary
plan
and
laying
out
the
foundation
of
that
memorable
white
jacket
of
mine
i
had
had
an
earnest
eye
to
all
these
inconveniences
and
to
avoid
them
i
proposed
that
not
only
should
my
jacket
keep
me
warm
but
that
it
should
also
be
so
constructed
as
to
contain
a
shirt
or
two
a
pair
of
trowsers
and
divers
utensils
books
biscuits
and
the
like
with
this
object
i
had
accordingly
provided
it
with
a
great
variety
of
pockets
pantries
and
cupboards
the
principal
apartments
two
in
number
were
placed
in
the
skirts
with
a
wide
hospitable
entrance
from
the
inside
two
more
of
smaller
capacity
were
planted
in
each
breast
with
communicating
so
that
in
case
of
emergency
to
accommodate
any
bulky
articles
the
two
pockets
in
each
breast
could
be
thrown
into
one
there
were
also
several
unseen
recesses
behind
the
arras
insomuch
that
my
jacket
like
an
old
castle
was
full
of
winding
stairs
and
mysterious
closets
crypts
and
cabinets
and
like
a
confidential
abounded
in
snug
little
lairs
and
for
the
storage
of
valuables
superadded
to
these
were
four
capacious
pockets
on
the
outside
one
pair
to
slip
books
into
when
suddenly
startled
from
my
studies
to
the
and
the
other
pair
for
permanent
mittens
to
thrust
my
hands
into
of
a
cold
this
last
contrivance
was
regarded
as
needless
by
one
of
my
who
showed
me
a
pattern
for
which
he
said
was
much
better
than
mine
it
must
be
known
that
sailors
even
in
the
bleakest
weather
only
cover
their
hands
when
unemployed
they
never
wear
mittens
aloft
since
aloft
they
literally
carry
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
want
nothing
between
their
grasp
of
the
hemp
and
the
hemp
it
is
desirable
that
whatever
things
they
cover
their
hands
with
should
be
capable
of
being
slipped
on
and
off
in
a
moment
nay
it
is
desirable
that
they
should
be
of
such
a
nature
that
in
a
dark
night
when
you
are
in
a
great
going
to
the
may
be
jumped
into
indiscriminately
and
not
be
like
a
pair
of
kids
neither
of
which
will
admit
any
hand
but
the
particular
one
meant
for
it
my
contrivance
was
ought
to
have
got
out
a
patent
for
of
his
mittens
was
provided
with
two
thumbs
one
on
each
side
the
convenience
of
which
needs
no
comment
but
though
for
clumsy
seamen
whose
fingers
are
all
thumbs
this
description
of
mitten
might
do
very
well
did
not
so
much
fancy
it
for
when
your
hand
was
once
in
the
bag
of
the
mitten
the
empty
sometimes
dangled
at
your
palm
confounding
your
ideas
of
where
your
real
thumb
might
be
or
else
being
carefully
grasped
in
the
hand
was
continually
suggesting
the
insane
notion
that
you
were
all
the
while
having
hold
of
some
one
thumb
no
i
told
my
good
to
go
away
with
his
four
thumbs
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
two
thumbs
were
enough
for
any
man
for
some
time
after
completing
my
jacket
and
getting
the
furniture
and
household
stores
in
it
i
thought
that
nothing
could
exceed
it
for
convenience
seldom
now
did
i
have
occasion
to
go
to
my
bag
and
be
jostled
by
the
crowd
who
were
making
their
wardrobe
in
a
heap
if
i
wanted
anything
in
the
way
of
clothing
thread
needles
or
literature
the
chances
were
that
my
invaluable
jacket
contained
it
yes
i
fairly
hugged
myself
and
revelled
in
my
jacket
till
alas
a
long
rain
put
me
out
of
conceit
of
it
i
and
all
my
pockets
and
their
contents
were
soaked
through
and
through
and
my
of
shakespeare
was
reduced
to
an
omelet
however
availing
myself
of
a
fine
sunny
day
that
followed
i
emptied
myself
out
in
the
and
spread
all
my
goods
and
chattels
to
dry
but
spite
of
the
bright
sun
that
day
proved
a
black
one
the
scoundrels
on
deck
detected
me
in
the
act
of
discharging
my
saturated
cargo
they
now
knew
that
the
white
jacket
was
used
for
a
storehouse
the
consequence
was
that
my
goods
being
well
dried
and
again
stored
away
in
my
pockets
the
very
next
night
when
it
was
my
on
deck
and
not
in
the
top
where
they
were
all
honest
men
i
noticed
a
parcel
of
fellows
skulking
about
after
me
wherever
i
went
to
a
man
they
were
pickpockets
and
bent
upon
pillaging
me
in
vain
i
kept
clapping
my
pocket
like
a
nervous
old
gentlemen
in
a
crowd
that
same
night
i
found
myself
minus
several
valuable
articles
so
in
the
end
i
masoned
up
my
lockers
and
pantries
and
save
the
two
used
for
mittens
the
white
jacket
ever
after
was
pocketless
chapter
x
from
pockets
to
pickpockets
as
the
latter
part
of
the
preceding
chapter
may
seem
strange
to
those
landsmen
who
have
been
habituated
to
indulge
in
romantic
notions
of
the
character
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
set
down
here
certain
facts
on
this
head
which
may
serve
to
place
the
thing
in
its
true
light
from
the
wild
life
they
lead
and
various
other
causes
needless
to
mention
sailors
as
a
class
entertain
the
most
liberal
notions
concerning
morality
and
the
decalogue
or
rather
they
take
their
own
views
of
such
matters
caring
little
for
the
theological
or
ethical
definitions
of
others
concerning
what
may
be
criminal
or
wrong
their
ideas
are
much
swayed
by
circumstances
they
will
covertly
abstract
a
thing
from
one
whom
they
dislike
and
insist
upon
it
that
in
such
a
case
stealing
is
not
robbing
or
where
the
theft
involves
something
funny
as
in
the
case
of
the
white
jacket
they
only
steal
for
the
sake
of
the
joke
but
this
much
is
to
be
observed
nevertheless
that
they
never
spoil
the
joke
by
returning
the
stolen
article
it
is
a
good
joke
for
instance
and
one
often
perpetrated
on
board
ship
to
stand
talking
to
a
man
in
a
dark
night
watch
and
all
the
while
be
cutting
the
buttons
from
his
coat
but
once
off
those
buttons
never
grow
on
again
there
is
no
spontaneous
vegetation
in
buttons
perhaps
it
is
a
thing
unavoidable
but
the
truth
is
that
among
the
crew
of
a
scores
of
desperadoes
are
too
often
found
who
stop
not
at
the
largest
enormities
a
species
of
highway
robbery
is
not
unknown
to
them
a
will
be
informed
that
such
a
fellow
has
three
or
four
gold
pieces
in
the
or
purse
which
many
tars
wear
round
their
necks
tucked
out
of
sight
upon
this
they
deliberately
lay
their
plans
and
in
due
time
proceed
to
carry
them
into
execution
the
man
they
have
marked
is
perhaps
strolling
along
the
benighted
to
his
when
of
a
sudden
the
dash
out
from
their
throw
him
down
and
while
two
or
three
gag
him
and
hold
him
fast
another
cuts
the
bag
from
his
neck
and
makes
away
with
it
followed
by
his
comrades
this
was
more
than
once
done
in
the
neversink
at
other
times
hearing
that
a
sailor
has
something
valuable
secreted
in
his
hammock
they
will
rip
it
open
from
underneath
while
he
sleeps
and
reduce
the
conjecture
to
a
certainty
to
enumerate
all
the
minor
pilferings
on
board
a
would
be
endless
with
some
highly
commendable
exceptions
they
rob
from
one
another
and
rob
back
again
till
in
the
matter
of
small
things
a
community
of
goods
seems
almost
established
and
at
last
as
a
whole
they
become
relatively
honest
by
nearly
every
man
becoming
the
reverse
it
is
in
vain
that
the
officers
by
threats
of
condign
punishment
endeavour
to
instil
more
virtuous
principles
into
their
crew
so
thick
is
the
mob
that
not
one
thief
in
a
thousand
is
detected
chapter
xi
the
pursuit
of
poetry
under
difficulties
the
feeling
of
insecurity
concerning
possessions
in
the
neversink
which
the
things
just
narrated
begat
in
the
minds
of
honest
men
was
curiously
exemplified
in
the
case
of
my
poor
friend
lemsford
a
gentlemanly
young
member
of
the
i
had
very
early
made
the
acquaintance
of
lemsford
it
is
curious
how
unerringly
a
man
pitches
upon
a
spirit
any
way
akin
to
his
own
even
in
the
most
miscellaneous
mob
lemsford
was
a
poet
so
thoroughly
inspired
with
the
divine
afflatus
that
not
even
all
the
tar
and
tumult
of
a
could
drive
it
out
of
him
as
may
readily
be
imagined
the
business
of
writing
verse
is
a
very
different
thing
on
the
of
a
frigate
from
what
the
gentle
and
sequestered
wordsworth
found
it
at
placid
rydal
mount
in
westmoreland
in
a
frigate
you
can
not
sit
down
and
meander
off
your
sonnets
when
the
full
heart
prompts
but
only
when
more
important
duties
permit
such
as
bracing
round
the
yards
or
reefing
fore
and
aft
nevertheless
every
fragment
of
time
at
his
command
was
religiously
devoted
by
lemsford
to
the
nine
at
the
most
unseasonable
hours
you
would
behold
him
seated
apart
in
some
corner
among
the
before
him
pen
in
hand
and
eyes
a
fine
frenzy
that
born
about
got
a
fit
he
were
exclamations
often
made
by
the
less
learned
of
his
shipmates
some
deemed
him
a
conjurer
others
a
lunatic
and
the
knowing
ones
said
that
he
must
be
a
crazy
methodist
but
well
knowing
by
experience
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
is
its
own
exceeding
great
lemsford
wrote
on
dashing
off
whole
epics
sonnets
ballads
and
acrostics
with
a
facility
which
under
the
circumstances
amazed
me
often
he
read
over
his
effusions
to
me
and
well
worth
the
hearing
they
were
he
had
wit
imagination
feeling
and
humour
in
abundance
and
out
of
the
very
ridicule
with
which
some
persons
regarded
him
he
made
rare
metrical
sport
which
we
two
together
enjoyed
by
ourselves
or
shared
with
certain
select
friends
still
the
taunts
and
jeers
so
often
levelled
at
my
friend
the
poet
would
now
and
then
rouse
him
into
rage
and
at
such
times
the
haughty
scorn
he
would
hurl
on
his
foes
was
proof
positive
of
his
possession
of
that
one
attribute
irritability
almost
universally
ascribed
to
the
votaries
of
parnassus

chase
rather
patronised
lemsford
and
he
would
stoutly
take
his
part
against
scores
of
adversaries
frequently
inviting
him
up
aloft
into
his
top
he
would
beg
him
to
recite
some
of
his
verses
to
which
he
would
pay
the
most
heedful
attention
like
maecenas
listening
to
virgil
with
a
book
of
aeneid
in
his
hand
taking
the
liberty
of
a
he
would
sometimes
gently
criticise
the
piece
suggesting
a
few
immaterial
alterations
and
upon
my
word
noble
jack
with
his
good
sense
taste
and
humanity
was
not
ill
qualified
to
play
the
true
part
of
a
is
to
give
quarter
at
last
however
severe
the
critique
now
great
care
anxiety
and
endless
source
of
tribulation
was
the
preservation
of
his
manuscripts
he
had
a
little
box
about
the
size
of
a
small
and
secured
with
a
lock
in
which
he
kept
his
papers
and
stationery
this
box
of
course
he
could
not
keep
in
his
bag
or
hammock
for
in
either
case
he
would
only
be
able
to
get
at
it
once
in
the
hours
it
was
necessary
to
have
it
accessible
at
all
times
so
when
not
using
it
he
was
obliged
to
hide
it
out
of
sight
where
he
could
and
of
all
places
in
the
world
a
ship
of
war
above
her
least
abounds
in
secret
nooks
almost
every
inch
is
occupied
almost
every
inch
is
in
plain
sight
and
almost
every
inch
is
continually
being
visited
and
explored
added
to
all
this
was
the
deadly
hostility
of
the
whole
tribe
of
corporals
and
mates
to
the
poet
and
his
casket
they
hated
his
box
as
if
it
had
been
crammed
to
the
very
lid
with
hurricanes
and
gales
they
hunted
out
his
like
pointers
and
gave
him
no
peace
night
or
day
still
the
long
on
the
offered
some
promise
of
a
to
the
box
and
accordingly
it
was
often
tucked
away
behind
the
carriages
among
the
side
tackles
its
black
colour
blending
with
the
ebon
hue
of
the
guns
but
quoin
one
of
the
had
eyes
like
a
ferret
quoin
was
a
little
old
man
hardly
five
feet
high
with
a
complexion
like
a
wound
after
it
is
healed
he
was
indefatigable
in
attending
to
his
duties
which
consisted
in
taking
care
of
one
division
of
the
guns
embracing
ten
of
the
aforesaid
ranged
up
against
the
side
at
regular
intervals
they
resembled
not
a
little
a
stud
of
sable
chargers
in
their
stall
among
this
iron
stud
little
quoin
was
continually
running
in
and
out
currying
them
down
now
and
then
with
an
old
rag
or
keeping
the
flies
off
with
a
brush
to
quoin
the
honour
and
dignity
of
the
united
states
of
america
seemed
indissolubly
linked
with
the
keeping
his
guns
unspotted
and
glossy
he
himself
was
black
as
a
with
continually
tending
them
and
rubbing
them
down
with
black
paint
he
would
sometimes
get
outside
of
the
and
peer
into
their
muzzles
as
a
monkey
into
a
bottle
or
like
a
dentist
he
seemed
intent
upon
examining
their
teeth
quite
as
often
he
would
be
brushing
out
their
with
a
little
wisp
of
oakum
like
a
chinese
barber
in
canton
cleaning
a
ear
such
was
his
solicitude
that
it
was
a
thousand
pities
he
was
not
able
to
dwarf
himself
still
more
so
as
to
creep
in
at
the
and
examining
the
whole
interior
of
the
tube
emerge
at
last
from
the
muzzle
quoin
swore
by
his
guns
and
slept
by
their
side
woe
betide
the
man
whom
he
found
leaning
against
them
or
in
any
way
soiling
them
he
seemed
seized
with
the
crazy
fancy
that
his
darling
were
fragile
and
might
break
like
glass
retorts
now
from
this
vigilance
how
could
my
poor
friend
the
poet
hope
to
escape
with
his
box
twenty
times
a
week
it
was
pounced
upon
with
a
that
pillbox
again
and
a
loud
threat
to
pitch
it
overboard
the
next
time
without
a
warning
or
benefit
of
clergy
like
many
poets
lemsford
was
nervous
and
upon
these
occasions
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
once
with
an
inconsolable
countenance
he
came
to
me
saying
that
his
casket
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
sought
for
it
in
his
and
it
was
not
there
i
asked
him
where
he
had
hidden
it
the
guns
he
replied
depend
upon
it
lemsford
that
quoin
has
been
the
death
of
straight
to
quoin
went
the
poet
but
quoin
knew
nothing
about
it
for
ten
mortal
days
the
poet
was
not
to
be
comforted
dividing
his
leisure
time
between
cursing
quoin
and
lamenting
his
loss
the
world
is
undone
he
must
have
thought
no
such
calamity
has
befallen
it
since
the
deluge
verses
are
perished
but
though
quoin
as
it
afterward
turned
out
had
indeed
found
the
box
it
so
happened
that
he
had
not
destroyed
it
which
no
doubt
led
lemsford
to
infer
that
a
superintending
providence
had
interposed
to
preserve
to
posterity
his
invaluable
casket
it
was
found
at
last
lying
exposed
near
the
galley
lemsford
was
not
the
only
literary
man
on
board
the
neversink
there
were
three
or
four
persons
who
kept
journals
of
the
cruise
one
of
these
journalists
embellished
his
was
written
in
a
large
blank
various
coloured
illustrations
of
the
harbours
and
bays
at
which
the
frigate
had
touched
and
also
with
small
crayon
sketches
of
comical
incidents
on
board
the
frigate
itself
he
would
frequently
read
passages
of
his
book
to
an
admiring
circle
of
the
more
refined
sailors
between
the
guns
they
pronounced
the
whole
performance
a
miracle
of
art
as
the
author
declared
to
them
that
it
was
all
to
be
printed
and
published
so
soon
as
the
vessel
reached
home
they
vied
with
each
other
in
procuring
interesting
items
to
be
incorporated
into
additional
chapters
but
it
having
been
rumoured
abroad
that
this
journal
was
to
be
ominously
entitled
cruise
of
the
neversink
or
a
paixhan
shot
into
naval
abuses
and
it
having
also
reached
the
ears
of
the
that
the
work
contained
reflections
somewhat
derogatory
to
the
dignity
of
the
officers
the
volume
was
seized
by
the
armed
with
a
warrant
from
the
captain
a
few
days
after
a
large
nail
was
driven
straight
through
the
two
covers
and
clinched
on
the
other
side
and
thus
everlastingly
sealed
the
book
was
committed
to
the
deep
the
ground
taken
by
the
authorities
on
this
occasion
was
perhaps
that
the
book
was
obnoxious
to
a
certain
clause
in
the
articles
of
war
forbidding
any
person
in
the
navy
to
bring
any
other
person
in
the
navy
into
contempt
which
the
suppressed
volume
undoubtedly
did
chapter
xii
the
good
or
bad
temper
of
men
in
a
great
degree
attributable
to
their
particular
stations
and
duties
aboard
ship
quoin
the
was
the
representative
of
a
class
on
board
the
neversink
altogether
too
remarkable
to
be
left
astern
without
further
notice
in
the
rapid
wake
of
these
chapters
as
has
been
seen
quoin
was
full
of
unaccountable
whimsies
he
was
withal
a
very
cross
bitter
inflammable
old
man
so
too
were
all
the
members
of
the
gang
including
the
two
mates
and
all
the
every
one
of
them
had
the
same
dark
brown
complexion
all
their
faces
looked
like
smoked
hams
they
were
continually
grumbling
and
growling
about
the
batteries
running
in
and
out
among
the
guns
driving
the
sailors
away
from
them
and
cursing
and
swearing
as
if
all
their
conscience
had
been
and
made
callous
by
their
calling
indeed
they
were
a
most
unpleasant
set
of
men
especially
priming
the
mate
with
the
and
cylinder
his
stuttering
coadjutor
with
the
clubbed
foot
but
you
will
always
observe
that
the
gang
of
every
are
invariably
ugly
featured
and
quarrelsome
once
when
i
visited
an
english
ship
the
gang
were
fore
and
aft
polishing
up
the
batteries
which
according
to
the
fancy
had
been
painted
white
as
snow
fidgeting
round
the
great
and
making
stinging
remarks
at
the
sailors
and
each
other
they
reminded
one
of
a
swarm
of
black
wasps
buzzing
about
rows
of
white
headstones
in
a
now
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
their
being
so
much
among
the
guns
is
the
very
thing
that
makes
a
gang
so
cross
and
quarrelsome
indeed
this
was
once
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
our
whole
company
of
a
fine
of
ours
a
most
merry
and
companionable
fellow
chanced
to
be
promoted
to
a
berth
a
few
days
afterward
some
of
us
his
old
comrades
went
to
pay
him
a
visit
while
he
was
going
his
regular
rounds
through
the
division
of
guns
allotted
to
his
care
but
instead
of
greeting
us
with
his
usual
heartiness
and
cracking
his
pleasant
jokes
to
our
amazement
he
did
little
else
but
scowl
and
at
last
when
we
rallied
him
upon
his
he
seized
a
long
black
rammer
from
overhead
and
drove
us
on
deck
threatening
to
report
us
if
we
ever
dared
to
be
familiar
with
him
again
my
thought
that
this
remarkable
metamorphose
was
the
effect
produced
upon
a
weak
vain
character
suddenly
elevated
from
the
level
of
a
mere
seaman
to
the
dignified
position
of
a
but
though
in
similar
cases
i
had
seen
such
effects
produced
upon
some
of
the
crew
yet
in
the
present
instance
i
knew
better
than
that
was
solely
brought
about
by
his
consorting
with
with
those
villainous
irritable
cannon
more
especially
from
his
being
subject
to
the
orders
of
those
deformed
blunderbusses
priming
and
cylinder
the
truth
seems
to
be
indeed
that
all
people
should
be
very
careful
in
selecting
their
callings
and
vocations
very
careful
in
seeing
to
it
that
they
surround
themselves
by
objects
and
agreeable
sounds
many
an
angelic
disposition
has
had
its
even
edge
turned
and
hacked
like
a
saw
and
many
a
sweet
draught
of
piety
has
soured
on
the
heart
from
choosing
employments
and
omitting
to
gather
round
them
landscapes
gardeners
are
almost
always
pleasant
affable
people
to
converse
with
but
beware
of
keepers
of
arsenals
and
lonely
men
it
would
be
advisable
for
any
man
who
from
an
unlucky
choice
of
a
profession
which
it
is
too
late
to
change
for
another
should
find
his
temper
souring
to
endeavour
to
counteract
that
misfortune
by
filling
his
private
chamber
with
amiable
pleasurable
sights
and
sounds
in
summer
time
an
aeolian
harp
can
be
placed
in
your
window
at
a
very
trifling
expense
a
might
stand
on
your
mantel
to
be
taken
up
and
held
to
the
ear
that
you
may
be
soothed
by
its
continual
lulling
sound
when
you
feel
the
blue
fit
stealing
over
you
for
sights
a
or
dutch
mind
about
filling
be
recommended
it
should
be
placed
on
a
bracket
in
the
pier
nor
is
an
silver
ladle
nor
a
chased
nor
a
fine
portly
demijohn
nor
anything
indeed
that
savors
of
eating
and
drinking
bad
to
drive
off
the
spleen
but
perhaps
the
best
of
all
is
a
shelf
of
books
containing
comedies
farces
songs
and
humorous
novels
you
need
never
open
them
only
have
the
titles
in
plain
sight
for
this
purpose
peregrine
pickle
is
a
good
book
so
is
gil
blas
so
is
goldsmith
but
of
all
chamber
furniture
in
the
world
best
calculated
to
cure
a
had
temper
and
breed
a
pleasant
one
is
the
sight
of
a
lovely
wife
if
you
have
children
however
that
are
teething
the
nursery
should
be
a
good
way
up
stairs
at
sea
it
ought
to
be
in
the
indeed
teething
children
play
the
very
deuce
with
a
temper
i
have
known
three
promising
young
husbands
completely
spoil
on
their
hands
by
reason
of
a
teething
child
whose
worrisomeness
happened
to
be
aggravated
at
the
time
by
the
with
a
breaking
heart
and
my
handkerchief
to
my
eyes
i
followed
those
three
hapless
young
husbands
one
after
the
other
to
their
premature
graves
gossiping
scenes
breed
gossips
who
so
chatty
as
market
women
auctioneers
apothecaries
and
all
those
who
live
in
bustling
crowds
or
are
present
at
scenes
of
chatty
interest
solitude
breeds
taciturnity
every
body
knows
who
so
taciturn
as
authors
taken
as
a
race
a
forced
interior
quietude
in
the
midst
of
great
commotion
breeds
moody
people
who
so
moody
as
helmsmen
and
tenders
of
in
cotton
factories
for
all
these
must
hold
their
peace
while
employed
and
let
the
machinery
do
the
chatting
they
can
not
even
edge
in
a
single
syllable
now
this
theory
about
the
wondrous
influence
of
habitual
sights
and
sounds
upon
the
human
temper
was
suggested
by
my
experiences
on
board
our
frigate
and
i
regard
the
example
furnished
by
our
him
who
had
once
been
our
by
far
the
strongest
argument
in
favour
of
the
general
theory
yet
the
entire
ship
abounded
with
illustrations
of
its
truth
who
were
more
gayer
more
jocund
elastic
adventurous
given
to
fun
and
frolic
than
the
of
the
fore
main
and
mizzen
masts
the
reason
of
their
was
that
they
were
daily
called
upon
to
expatiate
themselves
all
over
the
rigging
the
reason
of
their
was
that
they
were
high
lifted
above
the
petty
tumults
carping
cares
and
paltrinesses
of
the
decks
below
and
i
feel
persuaded
in
my
inmost
soul
that
it
is
to
the
fact
of
my
having
been
a
and
especially
my
particular
post
being
on
the
loftiest
yard
of
the
frigate
the
that
i
am
now
enabled
to
give
such
a
free
broad
and
more
than
all
impartial
account
of
our
world
withholding
nothing
inventing
nothing
nor
flattering
nor
scandalising
any
but
meting
out
to
and
precise
descriptions
and
deserts
the
reason
of
the
mirthfulness
of
these
was
that
they
always
looked
out
upon
the
blue
boundless
dimpled
laughing
sunny
sea
nor
do
i
hold
that
it
militates
against
this
theory
that
of
a
stormy
day
when
the
face
of
the
ocean
was
black
and
overcast
that
some
of
them
would
grow
moody
and
chose
to
sit
apart
on
the
contrary
it
only
proves
the
thing
which
i
maintain
for
even
on
shore
there
are
many
people
naturally
gay
and
who
whenever
the
autumnal
wind
begins
to
bluster
round
the
corners
and
roar
along
the
straight
becomes
cross
petulant
and
irritable
what
is
more
mellow
than
fine
old
ale
yet
thunder
will
sour
the
best
ever
brewed
the
of
our
frigate
the
troglodytes
who
lived
down
in
the
tarry
cellars
and
caves
below
the
were
nearly
all
of
them
men
of
gloomy
dispositions
taking
sour
views
of
things
one
of
them
was
a
calvinist
whereas
the
who
spent
their
time
in
the
bracing
and
sunshine
of
the
forecastle
were
free
charitable
and
full
of
to
all
hands
though
some
of
them
to
tell
the
truth
proved
sad
exceptions
but
exceptions
only
prove
the
rule
the
on
the
the
and
in
all
divisions
of
the
frigate
fore
and
aft
were
a
set
with
contracted
souls
imputable
no
doubt
to
their
groveling
duties
more
especially
was
this
evinced
in
the
case
of
those
odious
ditchers
and
night
scavengers
the
ignoble
the
members
of
the
band
some
ten
or
twelve
in
number
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
keep
their
instruments
polished
and
play
a
lively
air
now
and
then
to
stir
the
stagnant
current
in
our
poor
old
torpid
veins
were
the
most
gleeful
set
of
fellows
you
ever
saw
they
were
portuguese
who
had
been
shipped
at
the
cape
de
verd
islands
on
the
passage
out
they
messed
by
themselves
forming
a
not
to
be
exceeded
ire
mirthfulness
by
a
club
of
young
bridegrooms
three
months
after
marriage
completely
satisfied
with
their
bargains
after
testing
them
but
what
made
them
now
so
full
of
fun
what
indeed
but
their
merry
martial
mellow
calling
who
could
he
a
churl
and
play
a
flageolet
who
mean
and
spiritless
braying
forth
the
souls
of
thousand
heroes
from
his
brazen
trump
but
still
more
efficacious
perhaps
in
ministering
to
the
light
spirits
of
the
band
was
the
consoling
thought
that
should
the
ship
ever
go
into
action
they
would
be
exempted
from
the
perils
of
battle
in
ships
of
war
the
members
of
the
as
the
band
is
called
are
generally
and
mostly
ship
with
the
express
understanding
that
as
soon
as
the
vessel
comes
within
long
of
an
enemy
they
shall
have
the
privilege
of
burrowing
down
in
the
or
sea
which
shows
that
they
are
inglorious
but
uncommonly
sensible
fellows
look
at
the
barons
of
the
purser
marine
officers
of
them
gentlemen
with
stiff
upper
lips
and
aristocratic
cut
noses
why
was
this
will
any
one
deny
that
from
their
living
so
long
in
high
military
life
served
by
a
crowd
of
menial
stewards
and
and
always
accustomed
to
command
right
and
left
will
any
one
deny
i
say
that
by
reason
of
this
their
very
noses
had
become
thin
peaked
aquiline
and
aristocratically
cartilaginous
even
old
cuticle
the
surgeon
had
a
roman
nose
but
i
never
could
account
how
it
came
to
be
that
our
grey
headed
first
lieutenant
was
a
little
that
is
one
of
his
shoulders
disproportionately
dropped
and
when
i
observed
that
nearly
all
the
first
lieutenants
i
saw
in
other
besides
many
second
and
third
lieutenants
were
similarly
i
knew
that
there
must
be
some
general
law
which
induced
the
phenomenon
and
i
put
myself
to
studying
it
out
as
an
interesting
problem
at
last
i
came
to
the
which
i
still
their
so
long
wearing
only
one
epaulet
for
to
only
one
does
their
rank
entitle
them
was
the
infallible
clew
to
this
mystery
and
when
any
one
reflects
upon
so
a
fact
that
many
sea
lieutenants
grow
decrepit
from
age
without
attaining
a
captaincy
and
wearing
epaulets
which
would
strike
the
balance
between
their
shoulders
the
above
reason
assigned
will
not
appear
unwarrantable
chapter

a
hermit
in
a
mob
the
allusion
to
the
poet
lemsford
in
a
previous
chapter
leads
me
to
speak
of
our
mutual
friends
nord
and
williams
who
with
lemsford
himself
jack
chase
and
my
comrades
of
the
comprised
almost
the
only
persons
with
whom
i
unreservedly
consorted
while
on
board
the
frigate
for
i
had
not
been
long
on
board
ere
i
found
that
it
would
not
do
to
be
intimate
with
everybody
an
indiscriminate
intimacy
with
all
hands
leads
to
sundry
annoyances
and
scrapes
too
often
ending
with
a
dozen
at
the
though
i
was
above
a
year
in
the
frigate
there
were
scores
of
men
who
to
the
last
remained
perfect
strangers
to
me
whose
very
names
i
did
not
know
and
whom
i
would
hardly
be
able
to
recognise
now
should
i
happen
to
meet
them
in
the
streets
in
the
at
sea
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
the
is
generally
filled
with
crowds
of
pedestrians
promenading
up
and
down
past
the
guns
like
people
taking
the
air
in
broadway
at
such
times
it
is
curious
to
see
the
men
nodding
to
each
recognitions
they
might
not
have
seen
each
other
for
a
week
exchanging
a
pleasant
word
with
a
friend
making
a
hurried
appointment
to
meet
him
somewhere
aloft
on
the
morrow
or
passing
group
after
group
without
deigning
the
slightest
salutation
indeed
i
was
not
at
all
singular
in
having
but
comparatively
few
acquaintances
on
board
though
certainly
carrying
my
fastidiousness
to
an
unusual
extent
my
friend
nord
was
a
somewhat
remarkable
character
and
if
mystery
includes
romance
he
certainly
was
a
very
romantic
one
before
seeking
an
introduction
to
him
through
lemsford
i
had
often
marked
his
tall
spare
upright
figure
stalking
like
don
quixote
among
the
pigmies
of
the
afterguard
to
which
he
belonged
at
first
i
found
him
exceedingly
reserved
and
taciturn
his
saturnine
brow
wore
a
scowl
he
was
almost
repelling
in
his
demeanour
in
a
word
he
seemed
desirous
of
hinting
that
his
list
of
war
friends
was
already
made
up
complete
and
full
and
there
was
no
room
for
more
but
observing
that
the
only
man
he
ever
consorted
with
was
lemsford
i
had
too
much
magnanimity
by
going
off
in
a
pique
at
his
coldness
to
let
him
lose
forever
the
chance
of
making
so
capital
an
acquaintance
as
myself
besides
i
saw
it
in
his
eye
that
the
man
had
been
a
reader
of
good
books
i
would
have
staked
my
life
on
it
that
he
seized
the
right
meaning
of
montaigne
i
saw
that
he
was
an
earnest
thinker
i
more
than
suspected
that
he
had
been
bolted
in
the
mill
of
adversity
for
all
these
things
my
heart
yearned
toward
him
i
determined
to
know
him
at
last
i
succeeded
it
was
during
a
profoundly
quiet
midnight
watch
when
i
perceived
him
walking
alone
in
the
waist
while
most
of
the
men
were
dozing
on
the
that
night
we
scoured
all
the
prairies
of
reading
dived
into
the
bosoms
of
authors
and
tore
out
their
hearts
and
that
night
learned
more
than
he
has
ever
done
in
any
single
night
since
the
man
was
a
marvel
he
amazed
me
as
much
as
coleridge
did
the
troopers
among
whom
he
enlisted
what
could
have
induced
such
a
man
to
enter
a
all
my
sapience
can
not
fathom
and
how
he
managed
to
preserve
his
dignity
as
he
did
among
such
a
rabble
rout
was
equally
a
mystery
for
he
was
no
sailor
as
ignorant
of
a
ship
indeed
as
a
man
from
the
sources
of
the
niger
yet
the
officers
respected
him
and
the
men
were
afraid
of
him
this
much
was
observable
however
that
he
faithfully
discharged
whatever
special
duties
devolved
upon
him
and
was
so
fortunate
as
never
to
render
himself
liable
to
a
reprimand
doubtless
he
took
the
same
view
of
the
thing
that
another
of
the
crew
did
and
had
early
resolved
so
to
conduct
himself
as
never
to
run
the
risk
of
the
scourge
and
this
it
must
have
to
whatever
incommunicable
grief
which
might
have
been
made
this
nord
such
a
wandering
recluse
even
among
our
mob
nor
could
he
have
long
swung
his
hammock
on
board
ere
he
must
have
found
that
to
insure
his
exemption
from
that
thing
which
alone
affrighted
him
he
must
be
content
for
the
most
part
to
turn
a
and
socially
expatriate
himself
from
many
things
which
might
have
rendered
his
situation
more
tolerable
still
more
several
events
that
took
place
must
have
horrified
him
at
times
with
the
thought
that
however
he
might
isolate
and
entomb
himself
yet
for
all
this
the
improbability
of
his
being
overtaken
by
what
he
most
dreaded
never
advanced
to
the
infallibility
of
the
impossible
in
my
intercourse
with
nord
he
never
made
allusion
to
his
past
subject
upon
which
most
castaways
in
a
are
very
diffuse
relating
their
adventures
at
the
the
recklessness
with
which
they
have
run
through
the
amplest
fortunes
in
a
single
season
their
and
gratuities
to
porters
and
poor
relations
and
above
all
their
youthful
indiscretions
and
the
ladies
they
have
left
behind
no
such
tales
had
nord
to
tell
concerning
the
past
he
was
barred
and
locked
up
like
the
specie
vaults
of
the
bank
of
england
for
anything
that
dropped
from
him
none
of
us
could
be
sure
that
he
had
ever
existed
till
now
altogether
he
was
a
remarkable
man
my
other
friend
williams
was
a
yankee
from
maine
who
had
been
both
a
peddler
and
a
pedagogue
in
his
day
he
had
all
manner
of
stories
to
tell
about
nice
little
country
frolics
and
would
run
over
an
endless
list
of
his
sweethearts
he
was
honest
acute
witty
full
of
mirth
and
good
laughing
philosopher
he
was
invaluable
as
a
pill
against
the
spleen
and
with
the
view
of
extending
the
advantages
of
his
society
to
the
saturnine
nord
i
introduced
them
to
each
other
but
nord
cut
him
dead
the
very
same
evening
when
we
sallied
out
from
between
the
guns
for
a
walk
on
the
chapter
xiv
a
draught
in
a
we
were
not
many
days
out
of
port
when
a
rumour
was
set
afloat
that
dreadfully
alarmed
many
tars
it
was
this
that
owing
to
some
unprecedented
oversight
in
the
purser
or
some
equally
unprecedented
remissness
in
the
at
callao
the
supply
of
that
delectable
beverage
called
was
expended
in
the
american
navy
the
law
allows
one
gill
of
spirits
per
day
to
every
seaman
in
two
portions
it
is
served
out
just
previous
to
breakfast
and
dinner
at
the
roll
of
the
drum
the
sailors
assemble
round
a
large
tub
or
cask
filled
with
liquid
and
as
their
names
are
called
off
by
a
midshipman
they
step
up
and
regale
themselves
from
a
little
tin
measure
called
a
no
helping
himself
to
tokay
off
a
sideboard
smacks
his
lips
with
more
mighty
satisfaction
than
the
sailor
does
over
this
to
many
of
them
indeed
the
thought
of
their
daily
forms
a
perpetual
perspective
of
ravishing
landscapes
indefinitely
receding
in
the
distance
it
is
their
great
in
take
away
their
grog
and
life
possesses
no
further
charms
for
them
it
is
hardly
to
be
doubted
that
the
controlling
inducement
which
keeps
many
men
in
the
navy
is
the
unbounded
confidence
they
have
in
the
ability
of
the
united
states
government
to
supply
them
regularly
and
unfailingly
with
their
daily
allowance
of
this
beverage
i
have
known
several
forlorn
individuals
shipping
as
landsmen
who
have
confessed
to
me
that
having
contracted
a
love
for
ardent
spirits
which
they
could
not
renounce
and
having
by
their
foolish
courses
been
brought
into
the
most
abject
that
they
could
no
longer
gratify
their
thirst
incontinently
entered
the
navy
regarding
it
as
the
asylum
for
all
drunkards
who
might
there
prolong
their
lives
by
regular
hours
and
exercise
and
twice
every
day
quench
their
thirst
by
moderate
and
undeviating
doses
when
i
once
remonstrated
with
an
old
toper
of
a
about
this
daily
when
i
told
him
it
was
ruining
him
and
advised
him
to
his
and
receive
the
money
for
it
in
addition
to
his
wages
as
provided
by
law
he
turned
about
on
me
with
an
irresistibly
waggish
look
and
said
up
my
grog
and
why
because
it
is
ruining
me
no
no
i
am
a
good
christian
and
love
my
enemy
too
much
to
drop
his
it
may
be
readily
imagined
therefore
what
consternation
and
dismay
pervaded
the
at
the
first
announcement
of
the
tidings
that
the
grog
was
expended
grog
gone
roared
an
old
lord
what
a
pain
in
my
stomach
cried
a
worse
than
the
cholera
cried
a
man
of
the
sooner
the
would
give
out
said
a
captain
of
the
hold
we
ganders
and
geese
that
we
can
live
without
grog
asked
a
corporal
of
marines
we
must
now
drink
with
the
ducks
cried
a
a
tot
left
groaned
a
waister
a
toothful
sighed
a
holder
from
the
bottom
of
his
boots
yes
the
fatal
intelligence
proved
true
the
drum
was
no
longer
heard
rolling
the
men
to
the
tub
and
deep
gloom
and
dejection
fell
like
a
cloud
the
ship
was
like
a
great
city
when
some
terrible
calamity
has
overtaken
it
the
men
stood
apart
in
groups
discussing
their
woes
and
mutually
condoling
no
longer
of
still
moonlight
nights
was
the
song
heard
from
the
giddy
tops
and
few
and
far
between
were
the
stories
that
were
told
it
was
during
this
interval
so
dismal
to
many
that
to
the
amazement
of
all
hands
ten
men
were
reported
by
the
to
be
intoxicated
they
were
brought
up
to
the
mast
and
at
their
appearance
the
doubts
of
the
most
skeptical
were
dissipated
but
whence
they
had
obtained
their
liquor
no
one
could
tell
it
was
observed
however
at
the
time
that
the
tarry
knaves
all
smelled
of
lavender
like
so
many
dandies
after
their
examination
they
were
ordered
into
the
a
between
two
guns
on
the
where
prisoners
are
kept
here
they
laid
for
some
time
stretched
out
stark
and
stiff
with
their
arms
folded
over
their
breasts
like
so
many
effigies
of
the
black
prince
on
his
monument
in
canterbury
cathedral
their
first
slumbers
over
the
marine
sentry
who
stood
guard
over
them
had
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
keep
off
the
crowd
who
were
all
eagerness
to
find
out
how
in
such
a
time
of
want
the
prisoners
had
managed
to
drink
themselves
into
oblivion
in
due
time
they
were
liberated
and
the
secret
simultaneously
leaked
out
it
seemed
that
an
enterprising
man
of
their
number
who
had
suffered
severely
from
the
common
deprivation
had
all
at
once
been
struck
by
a
brilliant
idea
it
had
come
to
his
knowledge
that
the
steward
was
supplied
with
a
large
quantity
of
clandestinely
brought
out
in
the
ship
for
the
purpose
of
selling
it
on
his
own
account
to
the
people
of
the
coast
but
the
supply
proving
larger
than
the
demand
and
having
no
customers
on
board
the
frigate
but
lieutenant
selvagee
he
was
now
carrying
home
more
than
a
third
of
his
original
stock
to
make
a
short
story
of
it
this
functionary
being
called
upon
in
secret
was
readily
prevailed
upon
to
part
with
a
dozen
bottles
with
whose
contents
the
intoxicated
party
had
regaled
themselves
the
news
spread
far
and
wide
among
the
men
being
only
kept
secret
from
the
officers
and
underlings
and
that
night
the
long
cologne
bottles
jingled
in
corners
and
and
being
emptied
were
sent
flying
out
of
the
ports
with
brown
sugar
taken
from
the
and
hot
water
begged
from
the
the
men
made
all
manner
of
punches
toddies
and
cocktails
letting
fall
therein
a
small
drop
of
tar
like
a
bit
of
brown
toast
by
way
of
imparting
a
flavour
of
course
the
thing
was
managed
with
the
utmost
secrecy
and
as
a
whole
dark
night
elapsed
after
their
orgies
the
revellers
were
in
a
good
measure
secure
from
detection
and
those
who
indulged
too
freely
had
twelve
long
hours
to
get
sober
before
daylight
obtruded
next
day
fore
and
aft
the
whole
frigate
smelled
like
a
toilet
the
very
were
fragrant
and
from
the
mouth
of
many
a
grim
grizzled
old
came
the
most
fragrant
of
breaths
the
amazed
lieutenants
went
about
snuffing
up
the
gale
and
for
once
selvagee
had
no
further
need
to
flourish
his
perfumed
it
was
as
if
we
were
sailing
by
some
odoriferous
shore
in
the
vernal
season
of
violets
sabaean
odours
many
a
league
cheered
with
grateful
smell
old
ocean
but
alas
all
this
perfume
could
not
be
wasted
for
nothing
and
the
and
corporals
putting
this
and
that
together
very
soon
burrowed
into
the
secret
the
steward
was
called
to
account
and
no
more
lavender
punches
and
cologne
toddies
were
drank
on
board

about
the
period
of
the
excitement
that
my
was
not
a
little
wounded
and
my
sense
of
delicacy
altogether
shocked
by
a
polite
hint
received
from
the
cook
of
the
mess

which
i
happened
to
belong
to
understand
the
matter
it

needful
to
enter
into
preliminaries
the

thirty
or
forty
messes

and
for
the

all
the

of

the
business

for
the
cooking
for
the
crew
is
all
done
by
a
high
and
mighty
functionary
officially
called
the
assisted
by
several
deputies
in
our
frigate
this
personage
was
a
dignified
coloured
gentleman
whom
the
men
dubbed
coffee
and
his
assistants
negroes
also
went
by
the
poetical
appellations
of
and
now
the
required
very
little
science
though
old
coffee
often
assured
us
that
he
had
graduated
at
the
new
york
astor
house
under
the
immediate
eye
of
the
celebrated
coleman
and
stetson
all
he
had
to
do
was
in
the
first
place
to
keep
bright
and
clean
the
three
huge
coppers
or
caldrons
in
which
many
hundred
pounds
of
beef
were
daily
boiled
to
this
end
sunshine
and
every
morning
sprang
into
their
respective
apartments
stripped
to
the
waist
and
well
provided
with
bits
of
and
sand
by
exercising
these
in
a
very
vigorous
manner
they
threw
themselves
into
a
violent
perspiration
and
put
a
fine
polish
upon
the
interior
of
the
coppers
sunshine
was
the
bard
of
the
trio
and
while
all
three
would
be
busily
employed
clattering
their
against
the
metal
he
would
exhilarate
them
with
some
remarkable
domingo
melodies
one
of
which
was
the
following
i
my
shoe
in
an
old
canoe
johnio
come
winum
so
oh
i
my
boot
in
a
johnio
come
winum
so
den
de
copper
oh
oh
copper
when
i
listened
to
these
jolly
africans
thus
making
gleeful
their
toil
by
their
cheering
songs
i
could
not
help
murmuring
against
that
immemorial
rule
of
which
forbids
the
sailors
to
sing
out
as
in
when
pulling
ropes
or
occupied
at
any
other
duty
your
only
music
at
such
times
is
the
shrill
pipe
of
the
mate
which
is
almost
worse
than
no
music
at
all
and
if
the
mate
is
not
by
you
must
pull
the
ropes
like
convicts
in
profound
silence
or
else
endeavour
to
impart
unity
to
the
exertions
of
all
hands
by
singing
out
mechanically
and
then
pulling
all
together
now
when
sunshine
and
have
so
polished
the
coppers
that
a
white
kid
glove
might
be
drawn
along
the
inside
and
show
no
stain
they
leap
out
of
their
holes
and
the
water
is
poured
in
for
the
coffee
and
the
coffee
being
boiled
and
decanted
off
in
bucketfuls
the
cooks
of
the
messes
march
up
with
their
salt
beef
for
dinner
strung
upon
strings
and
tallied
with
labels
all
of
which
are
plunged
together
into
the
coppers
and
there
boiled
when
upon
the
beef
being
fished
out
with
a
huge
the
water
for
the
tea
is
poured
in
which
consequently
possesses
a
flavour
not
unlike
that
of
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
so
far
as
cooking
is
concerned
a
of
the
has
very
little
to
do
merely
carrying
his
provisions
to
and
from
the
grand
democratic
cookery
still
in
some
things
his
office
involves
many
annoyances
twice
a
week
butter
and
cheese
are
served
much
to
each
the
has
the
sole
charge
of
these
delicacies
the
great
difficulty
consists
in
so
catering
for
the
mess
touching
these
luxuries
as
to
satisfy
all
some
guzzlers
are
for
devouring
the
butter
at
a
meal
and
finishing
off
with
the
cheese
the
same
day
others
contend
for
saving
it
up
against
when
there
is
nothing
but
beef
and
bread
and
others
again
are
for
taking
a
very
small
bit
of
butter
and
cheese
by
way
of
dessert
to
each
and
every
meal
through
the
week
all
this
gives
rise
to
endless
disputes
debates
and
altercations
sometimes
with
his
square
of
painted
out
on
deck
between
the
guns
garnished
with
pots
and
pans
and
you
see
the
seated
on
a
matchtub
at
its
head
his
trowser
legs
rolled
up
and
arms
bared
presiding
over
the
convivial
party
men
you
have
any
butter
saving
it
up
for
you
know
the
value
of
butter
men
you
jim
take
your
hoof
off
the
cloth
devil
take
me
if
some
of
you
chaps
no
more
manners
than
so
many
swines
quick
men
quick
bear
a
hand
and
eat
got
my
to
make
yet
and
some
of
you
fellows
keep
as
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
sit
still
here
on
this
here
tub
here
and
look
on
there
there
men
all
had
enough
so
sail
away
out
of
this
and
let
me
clear
up
the
in
this
strain
would
one
of
the
periodical
cooks
of
mess
no
talk
to
us
he
was
a
tall
resolute
fellow
who
had
once
been
a
brakeman
on
a
railroad
and
he
kept
us
all
pretty
straight
from
his
fiat
there
was
no
appeal
but
it
was
not
thus
when
the
turn
came
to
others
among
us
then
it
was
out
for
the
business
of
dining
became
a
bore
and
digestion
was
seriously
impaired
by
the
unamiable
discourse
we
had
over
our
i
sometimes
thought
that
the
junks
of
lean
were
boiled
in
their
own
bristles
and
looked
gaunt
and
grim
like
pickled
chins
of
unwashed
something
to
do
with
creating
the
bristling
bitterness
at
times
prevailing
in
our
mess
the
men
tore
off
the
tough
hide
from
their
pork
as
if
they
were
indians
scalping
christians
some
cursed
the
cook
for
a
rogue
who
kept
from
us
our
butter
and
cheese
in
order
to
make
away
with
it
himself
in
an
underhand
manner
selling
it
at
a
premium
to
other
messes
and
thus
accumulating
a
princely
fortune
at
our
expense
others
anthematised
him
for
his
slovenliness
casting
hypercritical
glances
into
their
pots
and
pans
and
scraping
them
with
their
knives
then
he
would
be
railed
at
for
his
miserable
and
other
shortcoming
preparations
marking
all
this
from
the
beginning
i
was
sorely
troubled
with
the
idea
that
in
the
course
of
time
my
own
turn
would
come
round
to
undergo
the
same
objurgations
how
to
escape
i
knew
not
however
when
the
dreaded
period
arrived
i
received
the
keys
of
office
the
keys
of
the
with
a
resigned
temper
and
offered
up
a
devout
ejaculation
for
fortitude
under
the
trial
i
resolved
please
heaven
to
approve
myself
an
unexceptionable
caterer
and
the
most
impartial
of
stewards
the
first
day
there
was
to
business
which
devolved
upon
the
though
the
boiling
of
it
pertained
to
old
coffee
and
his
deputies
i
made
up
my
mind
to
lay
myself
out
on
that
to
centre
all
my
energies
upon
it
to
put
the
very
soul
of
art
into
it
and
achieve
an
unrivalled
that
should
put
out
of
conceit
all
other
and
for
ever
make
my
administration
memorable
from
the
proper
functionary
the
flour
was
obtained
and
the
raisins
the
or
from
old
coffee
and
the
requisite
supply
of
water
from
the
i
then
went
among
the
various
cooks
to
compare
their
receipts
for
making
and
having
well
weighed
them
all
and
gathered
from
each
a
choice
item
to
make
an
original
receipt
of
my
own
with
due
deliberation
and
solemnity
i
proceeded
to
business
placing
the
component
parts
in
a
tin
pan
i
kneaded
them
together
for
an
hour
entirely
reckless
as
to
pulmonary
considerations
touching
the
ruinous
expenditure
of
breath
and
having
decanted
the
dough
into
a
secured
the
muzzle
tied
on
the
tally
and
delivered
it
to
who
dropped
the
precious
bag
into
the
coppers
along
with
a
score
or
two
of
others
eight
bells
had
struck
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
had
piped
the
hands
to
dinner
my
was
set
out
and
my
messmates
were
assembled
knife
in
hand
all
ready
to
precipitate
themselves
upon
the
devoted
waiting
at
the
grand
cookery
till
my
turn
came
i
received
the
bag
of
pudding
and
gallanting
it
into
the
mess
proceeded
to
loosen
the
string
it
was
an
anxious
i
may
say
a
fearful
moment
my
hands
trembled
every
eye
was
upon
me
my
reputation
and
credit
were
at
stake
slowly
i
undressed
the
dandling
it
upon
my
knee
much
as
a
nurse
does
a
baby
about
the
excitement
increased
as
i
curled
down
the
bag
from
the
pudding
it
became
intense
when
at
last
i
plumped
it
into
the
pan
held
up
to
receive
it
by
an
eager
hand
bim
it
fell
like
a
man
shot
down
in
a
riot
distraction
it
was
harder
than
a
heart
yea
tough
as
the
cock
that
crowed
on
the
morn
that
peter
told
a
lie
of
the
mess
for
sake
permit
me
one
word
i
have
done
my
duty
by
that
but
they
beat
down
my
excuses
with
a
storm
of
criminations
one
present
proposed
that
the
fatal
pudding
should
be
tied
round
my
neck
like
a
and
myself
pushed
overboard
no
use
no
use
i
had
failed
ever
after
that
duff
lay
heavy
at
my
stomach
and
my
heart
after
this
i
grew
desperate
despised
popularity
returned
scorn
for
scorn
till
at
length
my
week
expired
and
in
the
i
transferred
the
keys
of
office
to
the
next
man
on
the
roll
somehow
there
had
never
been
a
very
cordial
feeling
between
this
mess
and
me
all
along
they
had
nourished
a
prejudice
against
my
white
jacket
they
must
have
harbored
the
silly
fancy
that
in
it
i
gave
myself
airs
and
wore
it
in
order
to
look
consequential
perhaps
as
a
cloak
to
cover
pilferings
of
from
the
mess
but
to
out
with
the
plain
truth
they
themselves
were
not
a
very
irreproachable
set
considering
the
sequel
i
am
coming
to
this
avowal
may
be
deemed
sheer
malice
but
for
all
that
i
can
not
avoid
speaking
my
mind
after
my
week
of
office
the
mess
gradually
changed
their
behaviour
to
me
they
cut
me
to
the
heart
they
became
cold
and
reserved
seldom
or
never
addressed
me
at
without
invidious
allusions
to
my
and
also
to
my
jacket
and
its
dripping
in
wet
weather
upon
the
however
i
had
no
idea
that
anything
serious
on
their
part
was
brewing
but
alas
so
it
turned
out
we
were
assembled
at
supper
one
evening
when
i
noticed
certain
winks
and
silent
hints
tipped
to
the
cook
who
presided
he
was
a
little
oily
fellow
who
had
once
kept
an
ashore
he
bore
me
a
grudge
looking
down
on
the
he
observed
that
some
fellows
never
knew
when
their
room
was
better
than
their
company
this
being
a
maxim
of
indiscriminate
application
of
course
i
silently
assented
to
it
as
any
other
reasonable
man
would
have
done
but
this
remark
was
followed
up
by
another
to
the
effect
that
not
only
did
some
fellows
never
know
when
their
room
was
better
than
their
company
but
they
persisted
in
staying
when
their
company
wanted
and
by
so
doing
disturbed
the
serenity
of
society
at
large
but
this
also
was
a
general
observation
that
could
not
be
gainsaid
a
long
and
ominous
pause
ensued
during
which
i
perceived
every
eye
upon
me
and
my
white
jacket
while
the
cook
went
on
to
enlarge
upon
the
disagreeableness
of
a
perpetually
damp
garment
in
the
mess
especially
when
that
garment
was
white
this
was
coming
nearer
home
yes
they
were
going
to
me
but
i
resolved
to
sit
it
out
a
little
longer
never
dreaming
that
my
moralist
would
proceed
to
extremities
while
all
hands
were
present
but
bethinking
him
that
by
going
this
roundabout
way
he
would
never
get
at
his
object
he
went
off
on
another
tack
apprising
me
in
substance
that
he
was
instructed
by
the
whole
mess
then
and
there
assembled
to
give
me
warning
to
seek
out
another
club
as
they
did
not
longer
fancy
the
society
either
of
myself
or
my
jacket
i
was
shocked
such
a
want
of
tact
and
delicacy
common
propriety
suggested
that
a
intimation
of
that
nature
should
be
conveyed
in
a
private
interview
or
still
better
by
note
i
immediately
rose
tucked
my
jacket
about
me
bowed
and
departed
and
now
to
do
myself
justice
i
must
add
that
the
next
day
i
was
received
with
open
arms
by
a
glorious
set
of
no
among
the
rest
my
noble
captain
jack
chase
this
mess
was
principally
composed
of
the
headmost
men
of
the
and
out
of
a
pardonable
they
called
themselves
the
club
meaning
that
they
were
one
and
all
fellows
of
large
intellectual
and
corporeal
calibre
their
was
well
located
on
their
starboard
hand
was
mess
no
embracing
sundry
rare
jokers
and
high
livers
who
waxed
gay
and
epicurean
over
their
salt
fare
and
were
known
as
the
for
the
destruction
of
beef
and
on
the
larboard
hand
was

no
made
up
entirely
of
a
dashing
set
of
who
called
themselves
the
horn
snorters
and
neversink
opposite
was
one
of
the
marine
messes
mustering
the
aristocracy
of
the
marine
two
corporals
the
drummer
and
fifer
and
some
six
or
eight
rather
gentlemanly
privates
americans
who
had
served
in
the
seminole
campaigns
of
florida
and
they
now
enlivened
their
salt
fare
with
stories
of
wild
ambushes
in
the
everglades
and
one
of
them
related
a
surprising
tale
of
his
encounter
with
osceola
the
indian
chief
whom
he
fought
one
morning
from
daybreak
till
breakfast
time
this
slashing
private
also
boasted
that
he
could
take
a
chip
from
between
your
teeth
at
twenty
paces
he
offered
to
bet
any
amount
on
it
and
as
he
could
get
no
one
to
hold
the
chip
his
boast
remained
for
ever
good
besides
many
other
attractions
which
the
furnished
it
had
this
one
special
advantage
that
owing
to
there
being
so
many
in
it
all
the
members
of
the
mess
were
exempt
from
doing
duty
as
cooks
and
stewards
a
fellow
called

to
that
business
during
the
entire
cruise
he
was
a
long
lank
pallid
varlet
going
by
the
name
of
shanks
in
very
warm
weather
this
shanks
would
sit
at
the
foot
of
the
fanning
himself
with
the
front
flap
of
his
frock
or
shirt
which
he
inelegantly
wore
over
his
trousers
jack
chase
the
president
of
the
club
frequently
remonstrated
against
this
breach
of
good
manners
but
the
had
somehow
contracted
the
habit
and
it
proved
incurable
for
a
time
jack
chase
out
of
a
polite
nervousness
touching
myself
as
a
member
of
the
club
would
frequently
endeavour
to
excuse
to
me
the
vulgarity
of
shanks
one
day
he
wound
up
his
remarks
by
the
philosophic
my
dear
fellow
what
can
you
expect
of
him
our
real
misfortune
is
that
our
noble
club
should
be
obliged
to
dine
with
its

several
of
these
on

men
of
no
mark
or
consideration
whatever
in
the
ship
lost
to
all
noble
promptings
sighing
for
no
worlds
to
conquer
and
perfectly
contented
with
mixing
their
and
spreading
their
and
mustering
their
pots
and
pans
together
three
times
every
day

undue

nothing
can
be
more
distressing
than

well
may
it
be
so
called

it
amounts
to

as
the

for
which

fire
off

it

of
course
deemed
indispensable
that

be
duly
instructed

and
perspiration
for
one
i
ever
abominated
it
i
have
a
heart
like
julius
caesar
and
upon
occasions
would
fight
like
caius
marcius
coriolanus
if
my
beloved
and
for
ever
glorious
country
should
be
ever
in
jeopardy
from
invaders
let
congress
put
me
on
a
in
the
and
see
how
i
will
acquit
myself
but
to
toil
and
sweat
in
a
fictitious
encounter
to
squander
the
precious
breath
of
my
precious
body
in
a
ridiculous
fight
of
shams
and
pretensions
to
hurry
about
the
decks
pretending
to
carry
the
killed
and
wounded
below
to
be
told
that
i
must
consider
the
ship
blowing
up
in
order
to
exercise
myself
in
presence
of
mind
and
prepare
for
a
real
explosion
all
this
i
despise
as
beneath
a
true
tar
and
man
of
valour
these
were
my
sentiments
at
the
time
and
these
remain
my
sentiments
still
but
as
while
on
board
the
frigate
my
liberty
of
thought
did
not
extend
to
liberty
of
expression
i
was
obliged
to
keep
these
sentiments
to
myself
though
indeed
i
had
some
thoughts
of
addressing
a
letter
marked
and
to
his
honour
the
commodore
on
the
subject
my
station
at
the
batteries
was
at
one
of
the
carronades
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
for
the
benefit
of
a
quaker
reader
here
and
there
a
word
or
two
in
explanation
of
a
carronade
may
not
be
amiss
the
carronade
is
a
gun
comparatively
short
and
light
for
its
calibre
a
carronade
throwing
a
shot
weighs
considerably
less
than
a
only
throwing
a
shot
it
further
differs
from
a
in
working
with
a
joint
and
bolt
underneath
instead
of
the
short
arms
or
at
the
sides
its
likewise
is
quite
different
from
that
of
a
having
a
sort
of
sliding
apparatus
something
like
an
extension
the
goose
on
it
however
is
a
tough
one
and
villainously
stuffed
with
most
indigestible
dumplings
the
range
of
a
carronade
does
not
exceed
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
much
less
than
the
range
of
a
when
of
large
calibre
however
it
throws
within
that
limit
paixhan
shot
all
manner
of
shells
and
combustibles
with
great
effect
being
a
very
destructive
engine
at
close
quarters
this
piece
is
now
very
generally
found
mounted
in
the
batteries
of
the
english
and
american
navies
the
armaments
of
most
modern
frigates
wholly
consist
of
carronades
the
name
is
derived
from
the
village
of
carron
in
scotland
at
whose
celebrated
founderies
this
iron
attila
was
first
cast
i
did
not
fancy
this
station
at
all
for
it
is
well
known
on
shipboard
that
in
time
of
action
the
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
posts
of
a
the
reason
is
that
the
officers
of
the
highest
rank
are
there
stationed
and
the
enemy
have
an
ungentlemanly
way
of
at
their
buttons
if
we
should
chance
to
engage
a
ship
then
who
could
tell
but
some
bungling
in
the
tops
might
put
a
bullet
through
instead
of
the
commodore
if
they
hit
no
doubt
he
would
not
feel
it
much
for
he
was
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
and
indeed
had
a
bullet
in
him
already
whereas
was
altogether
unaccustomed
to
having
blue
pills
playing
round
my
head
in
such
an
indiscriminate
way
besides
ours
was
a
and
every
one
knows
what
a
peculiarly
dangerous
predicament
the
of
was
in
at
the
battle
of
trafalgar
how
the
lofty
tops
of
the
enemy
were
full
of
soldiers
peppering
away
at
the
english
admiral
and
his
officers
many
a
poor
sailor
at
the
guns
of
that
must
have
received
a
bullet
intended
for
some
wearer
of
an
epaulet
by
candidly
confessing
my
feelings
on
this
subject
i
do
by
no
means
invalidate
my
claims
to
being
held
a
man
of
prodigious
valour
i
merely
state
my
invincible
repugnance
to
being
shot
for
somebody
else
if
i
am
shot
be
it
with
the
express
understanding
in
the
shooter
that
i
am
the
identical
person
intended
so
to
be
served
that
thracian
who
with
his
compliments
sent
an
arrow
into
the
king
of
macedon
superscribed
right
set
a
fine
example
to
all
warriors
the
hurried
hasty
indiscriminate
reckless
abandoned
manner
in
which
both
sailors
and
soldiers
nowadays
fight
is
really
painful
to
any
methodical
old
gentleman
especially
if
he
chance
to
have
systematized
his
mind
as
an
accountant
there
is
little
or
no
skill
and
bravery
about
it
two
parties
armed
with
lead
and
old
iron
envelop
themselves
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
pitch
their
lead
and
old
iron
about
in
all
directions
if
you
happen
to
be
in
the
way
you
are
hit
possibly
killed
if
not
you
escape
in
if
by
good
or
bad
luck
as
the
case
may
be
a
round
shot
fired
at
random
through
the
smoke
happens
to
send
overboard
your
another
to
unship
your
rudder
there
you
lie
crippled
pretty
much
at
the
mercy
of
your
foe
who
accordingly
pronounces
himself
victor
though
that
honour
properly
belongs
to
the
law
of
gravitation
operating
on
the
balls
in
the
smoke
instead
of
tossing
this
old
lead
and
iron
into
the
air
therefore
it
would
be
much
better
amicably
to
toss
up
a
copper
and
let
heads
win
the
carronade
at
which
i
was
stationed
was
known
as
no
on
the
first
among
our
crew
however
it
was
known
as
this
name
was
bestowed
by
the
captain
of
the
fine
honour
of
his
sweetheart
a
coloured
lady
of
philadelphia
of
black
bet
i
was
and
ram
and
sponge
i
did
like
a
good
fellow
i
have
no
doubt
that
had
i
and
my
gun
been
at
the
battle
of
the
nile
we
would
mutually
have
immortalised
ourselves
the
would
have
been
hung
up
in
westminster
abbey
and
i
ennobled
by
the
king
besides
receiving
the
illustrious
honour
of
an
autograph
letter
from
his
majesty
through
the
perfumed
right
hand
of
his
private
secretary
but
it
was
terrible
work
to
help
run
in
and
out
of
the
porthole
that
amazing
mass
of
metal
especially
as
the
thing
must
be
clone
in
a
trice
then
at
the
summons
of
a
horrid
rasping
rattle
swayed
by
the
captain
in
person
we
were
made
to
rush
from
our
guns
seize
pikes
and
pistols
and
repel
an
imaginary
army
of
boarders
who
by
a
fiction
of
the
officers
were
supposed
to
be
assailing
all
sides
of
the
ship
at
once
after
cutting
and
slashing
at
them
a
while
we
jumped
back
to
our
guns
and
again
went
to
jerking
our
elbows
meantime
a
loud
cry
is
heard
of
fire
fire
in
the
and
a
regular
engine
worked
by
a
set
of
tars
is
forthwith
set
to
playing
streams
of
water
aloft
and
now
it
is
fire
fire
on
the
and
the
entire
ship
is
in
as
great
a
commotion
as
if
a
whole
city
ward
were
in
a
blaze
are
our
officers
of
the
navy
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
laws
of
good
health
do
they
not
know
that
this
violent
exercise
taking
place
just
after
a
hearty
dinner
as
it
generally
does
is
eminently
calculated
to
breed
the
dyspepsia
there
was
no
satisfaction
in
dining
the
flavour
of
every
mouthful
was
destroyed
by
the
thought
that
the
next
moment
the
cannonading
drum
might
be
beating
to
quarters
such
a
was
our
captain
that
sometimes
we
were
roused
from
our
hammocks
at
night
when
a
scene
would
ensue
that
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
pen
and
ink
to
describe
five
hundred
men
spring
to
their
feet
dress
themselves
take
up
their
bedding
and
run
to
the
nettings
and
stow
it
then
he
to
their
man
jostling
his
alow
some
aloft
some
this
way
some
that
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
frigate
is
ready
for
action
and
still
as
the
grave
almost
every
man
precisely
where
he
would
be
were
an
enemy
actually
about
to
be
engaged
the
gunner
like
a
cornwall
miner
in
a
cave
is
burrowing
down
in
the
magazine
under
the
which
is
lighted
by
placed
behind
glazed
glass
inserted
in
the
bulkhead
the
or
boys
who
fetch
and
carry
cartridges
are
scampering
to
and
fro
among
the
guns
and
the
and
second
stand
ready
to
receive
their
supplies
these
as
they
are
called
enact
a
curious
part
in
time
of
action
the
entrance
to
the
magazine
on
the
where
they
procure
their
food
for
the
guns
is
guarded
by
a
woollen
screen
and
a
mate
standing
behind
it
thrusts
out
the
cartridges
through
a
small
in
this
screen
the

perhaps
red
hot
are
flying
in
all
directions
and
to
protect
their
cartridges
the
hurriedly
wrap
them
up
in
their
jackets
and
with
all
haste
scramble
up
the
ladders
to
their
respective
guns
like
waiters
hurrying
along
with
hot
cakes
for
breakfast
at
the

uncovered
showing
the
so
called
for
they
precisely
resemble
bunches
of
the
fruit
though
to
receive
a
bunch
of
iron
grapes
in
the
abdomen
would
be
but
a
sorry
dessert
and
also
showing
the
iron
of
various
sorts
packed
in
a
tin
case
like
a
imagine
some
midnight
craft
sailing
down
on
her
enemy
thus
pounders
levelled
matches
lighted
and
each
captain
of
his
gun
at
his
post
but
if
verily
going
into
action
then
would
the
neversink
have
made
still
further
preparations
for
however
alike
in
some
things
there
is
always
a
vast
you
sound
a
reality
and
a
sham
not
to
speak
of
the
pale
sternness
of
the
men
at
their
guns
at
such
a
juncture
and
the
choked
thoughts
at
their
hearts
the
ship
itself
would
here
and
there
present
a
far
different
appearance
something
like
that
of
an
extensive
mansion
preparing
for
a
grand
entertainment
when
are
withdrawn
chambers
converted
into
and
every
inch
of
available
space
thrown
into
one
continuous
whole
for
previous
to
an
action
every
in
a
is
knocked
down
great
guns
are
run
out
of
the
parlour
windows
nothing
separates
the
quarters
from
those
of
the
men
but
an
ensign

for
a
curtain

are
tumbled
down
into
the
hold
and
the
hospital
which
all
carry

large

forth
from

in

slung
in
chains
distributed

and
there
hillocks
of
piled
between

guns
suspended
within
easy
reach
from
the
beams
and
solid
masses
of
wads
big
as
dutch
cheeses
braced
to
the
cheeks
of
the
no
small
difference
also
would
be
visible
in
the
wardrobe
of
both
officers
and
men
the
officers
generally
fight
as
dandies
dance
namely
in
silk
stockings
inasmuch
as
in
case
of
being
wounded
in
the
leg
the
can
be
more
easily
drawn
off
by
the
surgeon

sticks
and
works
into
the
wound
an
economical
captain
while
taking
care
to
case
his
legs
in
silk
might
yet
see
fit
to
save
his
best
suit
and
fight
in
his
old
clothes
for
besides
that
an
old
garment
might
much
better
be
cut
to
pieces
than
a
new
one
it
must
be
a
mighty
disagreeable
thing
to
die
in
a
stiff
coat
not
yet
worked
easy
under
the
at
such
times
a
man
should
feel
free
unencumbered
and
perfectly
at
his
ease
in
point
of
straps
and
suspenders
no
concerning
his
tailor
should
intrude
upon
his
thoughts
of
eternity
seneca
understood
this
when
he
chose
to
die
naked
in
a
bath
and
men
understand
it
also
for
most
of
them
in
battle
strip
to
the
wearing
nothing
but
a
pair
of
duck
trowsers
and
a
handkerchief
round
their
head
a
captain
combining
a
heedful
patriotism
with
economy
would
probably
his
old
topsails
before
going
into
battle
instead
of
exposing
his
best
canvas
to
be
riddled
to
pieces
for
it
is
generally
the
case
that
the
shot
flies
high
unless
allowance
is
made
for
it
in
pointing
the
tube
at
distance
the
slightest
roll
of
the
ship
at
the
time
of
firing
would
send
a
shot
meant
for
the
hull
high
over
the
yards
but
besides
these
differences
between
a
at
and
a
real
cannonading
the
aspect
of
the
ship
at
the
beating
of
the
retreat
would
in
the
latter
case
be
very
dissimilar
to
the
neatness
and
uniformity
in
the
former
our
bulwarks
might
look
like
the
walls
of
the
houses
in
west
broadway
in
new
york
after
being
broken
into
and
burned
out
by
the
negro
mob
our
stout
masts
and
yards
might
be
lying
about
decks
like
tree
boughs
after
a
tornado
in
a
piece
of
woodland
our
dangling
ropes
cut
and
sundered
in
all
directions
would
be
bleeding
tar
at
every
yard
and
strew
with
jagged
splinters
from
our
wounded
planks
the
might
resemble
a
shop
when
all
was
over
and
all
hands
would
be
piped
to
take
down
the
hammocks
from
the
exposed
nettings
where
they
play
the
part
of
the
cotton
bales
at
new
orleans
we
might
find
bits
of
broken
shot
iron
bolts
and
bullets
in
our
blankets
and
while
smeared
with
blood
like
butchers
the
surgeon
and
his
mates
would
be
amputating
arms
and
legs
on
the
an
underling
of

gang

be

arming
the
broken
chairs
and
tables
in
the
cabin

of
his
would
be

the
shattered
masts
and
yards

having
discharged
the
last
rivulet
of
blood
the
decks
would
be
washed
down
and
the
would
be
going
fore
and
aft
sprinkling
them
with
hot
vinegar
to
take
out
the
smell
from
the
planks
which
unless
some
such
means
are
employed
often
create
a
highly
offensive
effluvia

weeks
after

with

were

for

of

an
upright
carved
pole
somewhat
shorter

the

embossed
with
barnacles
and
its
sides
festooned
with
dolphins
were
sporting

flashing
around
it

one
white
bird
was
hovering
over
the
top
of
the
pole

ago
this
thing
must
have
been
thrown
to

must
have
been
drowned

i
came
near
pitching
off
the
bowsprit
the
other
day
and
when
i
scrambled
inboard
again
i
went
aft
to
get
a
squint
at
why

they
are

on

suppose

next
day
just
at
dawn
i
was
startled
from
my
hammock
by
the
cry
of
hands
about
ship
and
shorten
springing
up
the
ladders
i
found
that
an
unknown
man
had
fallen
overboard
from
the
chains
and
darting
a
glance
toward
the
poop
perceived
from
their
gestures
that
the
there
had
cut
away
the
buoys
it
was
blowing
a
fresh
breeze
the
frigate
was
going
fast
through
the
water
but
the
one
thousand
arms
of
five
hundred
men
soon
tossed
her
about
on
the
other
tack
and
checked
her
further
headway

him
shouted
the
officer
of
the
watch
through
his
trumpet
hailing

were
wanted
in

of
them
and
among
others
i
jumped
in
to
make
up
the
deficiency
men
give
way
and
each
man
look
out
along
his
oar
and
look
sharp
cried
the
officer
of
our
boat
for
a
time
in
perfect
silence
we
slid
up
and
down
the
great
seething
swells
of
the
sea
but
saw
nothing
no
use
cried
the
officer
gone
whoever
he
is
pull
away
away

recalling
us
him

cried
the
strokesman
spoiled
my
watch
below
for
the
devil

he
cried
another
one
never

replied
a
third
no
never
sing

my
hearties
cried
a

the
officer
look
along
your
but
the
sixteen
oarsmen
still
continued
their
talk
and
after
pulling
about
for
two
or
three
hours
we
spied
the
at
the
and
returned
on
board
having
seen
no
sign

of

hoisted
up
the

away

chapter

the
jacket
aloft
again
must
i
call
attention
to
my
white
jacket
which
about
this
time
came
near
being
the
death
of
me
i
am
of
a
meditative
humour
and
at
sea
used
often
to
mount
aloft
at
night
and
seating
myself
on
one
of
the
upper
yards
tuck
my
jacket
about
me
and
give
loose
to
reflection
in
some
ships
in
which
i
have
done
this
the
sailors
used
to
fancy
that
i
must
be
studying
indeed
to
some
extent
was
the
that
my
object
in
mounting
aloft
was
to
get
a
nearer
view
of
the
stars
supposing
me
of
course
to
be
a
very
silly
conceit
of
theirs
some
may
say
but
not
so
silly
after
all
for
surely
the
advantage
of
getting
nearer
an
object
by
two
hundred
feet
is
not
to
be
underrated
then
to
study
the
stars
upon
the
wide
boundless
sea
is
divine
as
it
was
to
the
chaldean
magi
who
observed
their
revolutions
from
the
plains
and
it
is
a
very
fine
feeling
and
one
that
fuses
us
into
the
universe
of
things
and
mates
us
a
part
of
the
all
to
think
that
wherever
we
rove
we
have
still
the
same
glorious
old
stars
to
keep
us
company
that
they
still
shine
onward
and
on
forever
beautiful
and
bright
and
luring
us
by
every
ray
to
die
and
be
glorified
with
them
ay
ay
we
sailors
sail
not
in
vain
we
expatriate
ourselves
to
nationalise
with
the
universe
and
in
all
our
voyages
round
the
world
we
are
still
accompanied
by
those
old
circumnavigators
the
stars
who
are
shipmates
and
of
in
blue
as
we
on
the
azure
main
let
genteel
generations
scoff
at
our
hardened
hands
and
tipped
with
they
ever
clasp
truer
palms
than
ours
let
them
feel
of
our
sturdy
hearts
beating
like
in
those
hot
smithies
our
bosoms
with
their
canes
let
them
feel
of
our
generous
pulses
and
swear
that
they
go
off
like
oh
give
me
again
the
joy
the
thrill
the
whirl
let
me
feel
thee
again
old
sea
let
me
leap
into
thy
saddle
once
more
i
am
sick
of
these
terra
firma
toils
and
cares
sick
of
the
dust
and
reek
of
towns
let
me
hear
the
clatter
of
hailstones
on
icebergs
and
not
the
dull
tramp
of
these
plodders
plodding
their
dull
way
from
their
cradles
to
their
graves
let
me
snuff
thee
up
and
whinny
in
thy
spray
forbid
it
intercede
for
me
with
neptune
o
sweet
amphitrite
that
no
dull
clod
may
fall
on
my
coffin
be
mine
the
tomb
that
swallowed
up
pharaoh
and
all
his
hosts
let
me
lie
down
with
drake
where
he
sleeps
in
the
sea
but
when
speaks
of
the
life
he
means
not
life
in
a
which
with
its
martial
formalities
and
thousand
vices
stabs
to
the
heart
the
soul
of
all
honourable
rovers
i
have
said
that
i
was
wont
to
mount
up
aloft
and
muse
and
thus
was
it
with
me
the
night
following
the
loss
of
the
cooper
ere
my
watch
in
the
top
had
expired
high
up
on
the
i
reclined
the
white
jacket
folded
around
me
like
sir
john
moore
in
his
frosted
cloak
eight
bells
had
struck
and
my
watchmates
had
hied
to
their
hammocks
and
the
other
watch
had
gone
to
their
stations
and
the
below
me
was
full
of
strangers
and
still
one
hundred
feet
above
even
i
lay
entranced
now
dozing
now
dreaming
now
thinking
of
things
past
and
anon
of
the
life
to
come
was
the
latter
thought
for
the
life
to
come
was
much
nearer
overtaking
me
than
i
then
could
imagine
perhaps
i
was
half
conscious
at
last
of
a
tremulous
voice
hailing
the
from
the
but
if
so
the
consciousness
glided
away
from
me
and
left
me
in
lethe
but
when
like
lightning
the
yard
dropped
under
me
and
instinctively
i
clung
with
both
hands
to
the
then
i
came
to
myself
with
a
rush
and
felt
something
like
a
choking
hand
at
my
throat
for
an
instant
i
thought
the
gulf
stream
in
my
head
was
whirling
me
away
to
eternity
but
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
standing
the
yard
had
descended
to
the
and
shaking
myself
in
my
jacket
i
felt
that
i
was
unharmed
and
alive
who
had
done
this
who
had
made
this
attempt
on
my
life
thought
i
as
i
ran
down
the
rigging
it
comes
lord
here
it
comes
see
see
it
is
white
as
a
coming
i
shouted
springing
down
into
the
top
white
as
a
hammock
my
soul
bill
only
infernal
again
it
seems
they
had
spied
a
moving
white
spot
there
aloft
and
had
taken
me
for
the
ghost
of
the
cooper
and
after
hailing
me
and
bidding
me
descend
to
test
my
corporeality
and
getting
no
answer
they
had
lowered
the
halyards
in
affright
in
a
rage
i
tore
off
the
jacket
and
threw
it
on
the
deck
cried
i
must
change
your
complexion
you
must
hie
to
the
dyers
and
be
dyed
that
i
may
live
i
have
but
one
poor
life
and
that
life
i
can
not
spare
i
can
not
consent
to
die
for
but
be
dyed
you
must
for
me
you
can
dye
many
times
without
injury
but
i
can
not
die
without
irreparable
loss
and
running
the
eternal
so
in
the
morning
jacket
in
hand
i
repaired
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
related
the
narrow
escape
i
had
had
during
the
night
i
enlarged
upon
the
general
perils
i
ran
in
being
taken
for
a
ghost
and
earnestly
besought
him
to
relax
his
commands
for
once
and
give
me
an
order
on
brush
the
captain
of
the
for
some
black
paint
that
my
jacket
might
be
painted
of
that
colour
look
at
it
sir
i
added
holding
it
lip
you
ever
see
anything
whiter
consider
how
it
shines
of
a
night
like
a
bit
of
the
milky
way
a
little
paint
sir
you
can
not
ship
has
no
paint
to
spare
he
said
must
get
along
without
every
rain
gives
me
a
soaking
cape
horn
is
at
would
make
it
waterproof
and
no
longer
would
i
be
in
peril
of
my
life
help
it
sir
depart
i
fear
it
will
not
be
well
with
me
in
the
end
for
if
my
own
sins
are
to
be
forgiven
only
as
i
forgive
that
and
unimpressible
first
lieutenant
then
pardon
there
is
none
for
me
what
when
but
one
dab
of
paint
would
make
a
man
of
a
ghost
and
it
mackintosh
of
a
refuse

i
am
full
i
can
say
no
more
chapter

how
they
sleep
in
a
no
more
of
my
luckless
jacket
for
a
while
let
me
speak
of
my
hammock
and
the
tribulations
i
endured
therefrom
give
me
plenty
of
room
to
swing
it
in
let
me
swing
it
between
two
on
an
arabian
plain
or
extend
it
diagonally
from
moorish
pillar
to
pillar
in
the
open
marble
court
of
the
lions
in
alhambra
let
me
swing
it
on
a
high
bluff
of
the
swing
in
the
pure
ether
for
every
swing
over
the
green
grass
or
let
me
oscillate
in
it
beneath
the
cool
dome
of
or
drop
me
in
it
as
in
a
balloon
from
the
zenith
with
the
whole
firmament
to
rock
and
expatiate
in
and
i
would
not
exchange
my
coarse
canvas
hammock
for
the
grand
like
a
stately
in
which
they
tuck
in
a
king
when
he
passes
a
night
at
blenheim
castle
when
you
have
the
requisite
room
you
always
have
in
your
hammock
that
is
two
horizontal
sticks
one
at
each
end
which
serve
to
keep
the
sides
apart
and
create
a
wide
vacancy
between
wherein
you
can
turn
over
and
on
this
side
or
that
on
your
back
if
you
please
stretch
out
your
legs
in
short
take
your
ease
in
your
hammock
for
of
all
inns
your
bed
is
the
best
but
when
with
five
hundred
other
hammocks
yours
is
crowded
and
jammed
on
all
sides
on
a
frigate
the
third
from
above
when
are
prohibited
by
an
express
edict
from
the
cabin
and
every
man
about
you
is
jealously
watchful
of
the
rights
and
privileges
of
his
own
proper
hammock
as
settled
by
law
and
usage
your
hammock
is
your
bastile
and
canvas
jug
into
which
or
out
of
which
it
is
very
hard
to
get
and
where
sleep
is

a
mockery
and
a
name
eighteen
inches
a

is
all
they
allow
you
eighteen
inches
in
width
in
you
must
swing
dreadful
they
give
you
more
swing
than
that
at
the
gallows
during
warm
nights
in
the
tropics
your
hammock
is
as
a
where
you
stew
and
stew
till
you
can
almost
hear
yourself
hiss
vain
are
all
stratagems
to
widen
your
accommodations
let
them
catch
you
insinuating
your
boots
or
other
articles
in
the
head
of
your
hammock
by
way
of
a
near
and
far
the
whole
rank
and
file
of
the
row
to
which
you
belong
feel
the
encroachment
in
an
instant
and
are
clamorous
till
the
guilty
one
is
found
out
and
his
pallet
brought
back
to
its
bearings
in
platoons
and
squadrons
they
all
lie
on
a
level
their
hammock
crossing
and
recrossing
in
all
directions
so
as
to
present
one
vast
midway
between
the
ceiling
and
the
floor
which
are
about
five
feet
asunder
one
extremely
warm
night
during
a
calm
when
it
was
so
hot
that
only
a
skeleton
could
keep
cool
from
the
free
current
of
air
through
its
bones
after
being
drenched
in
my
own
perspiration
i
managed
to
wedge
myself
out
of
my
hammock
and
with
what
little
strength
i
had
left
lowered
myself
gently
to
the
deck
let
me
see
now
thought
i
whether
my
ingenuity
can
not
devise
some
method
whereby
i
can
have
room
to
breathe
and
sleep
at
the
same
time
i
have
it
i
will
lower
my
hammock
underneath
all
these
others
and
that
separate
and
independent
level
at
shall
have
the
whole
to
myself
accordingly
i
lowered
away
my
pallet
to
the
desired
three
inches
from
the
crawled
into
it
again
but
alas
this
arrangement
made
such
a
sweeping
of
my
hammock
that
while
my
head
and
feet
were
at
par
the
small
of
my
back
was
settling
down
indefinitely
i
felt
as
if
some
gigantic
archer
had
hold
of
me
for
a
bow
but
there
was
another
plan
left
i
triced
up
my
hammock
with
all
my
strength
so
as
to
bring
it
wholly
the
tiers
of
pallets
around
me
this
done
by
a
last
effort
i
hoisted
myself
into
it
but
alas
it
was
much
worse
than
before
my
luckless
hammock
was
stiff
and
straight
as
a
board
and
there
i
out
in
it
with
my
nose
against
the
ceiling
like
a
dead
against
the
lid
of
his
coffin
so
at
last
i
was
fain
to
return
to
my
old
level
and
moralise
upon
the
folly
in
all
arbitrary
governments
of
striving
to
get
either
or
those
whom
legislation
has
placed
upon
an
equality
with
yourself
speaking
of
hammocks
recalls
a
circumstance
that
happened
one
night
in
the
neversink
it
was
three
or
four
times
repeated
with
various
but
not
fatal
results
the
watch
below
was
fast
asleep
on
the
where
perfect
silence
was
reigning
when
a
sudden
shock
and
a
groan
roused
up
all
hands
and
the
hem
of
a
pair
of
white
trowsers
vanished
up
one
of
the
ladders
at
the
we
ran
toward
the
groan
and
found
a
man
lying
on
the
deck
one
end
of
his
hammock
having
given
way
pitching
his
head
close
to
three
pound
cannon
shot
which
must
have
been
purposely
placed
in
that
position
when
it
was
discovered
that
this
man
had
long
been
suspected
of
being
an
among
the
crew
little
surprise
and
less
pleasure
were
evinced
at
his
narrow
escape
chapter
xxi
one
reason
why
men
are
generally
i
can
not
quit
this
matter
of
the
hammocks
without
making
mention
of
a
grievance
among
the
sailors
that
ought
to
be
redressed
in
a
at
sea
the
sailors
have
and
watch
that
is
through
every
hours
they
are
on
and
off
duty
every
four
hours
now
the
hammocks
are
piped
down
from
the
nettings
the
open
space
for
stowing
them
running
round
the
top
of
the
bulwarks
a
little
after
sunset
and
piped
up
again
when
the
forenoon
watch
is
called
at
eight
in
the
morning
so
that
during
the
daytime
they
are
inaccessible
as
pallets
this
would
be
all
well
enough
did
the
sailors
have
a
complete
rest
but
every
other
night
at
sea
one
watch
have
only
four
hours
in
their
hammocks
indeed
deducting
the
time
allowed
for
the
other
watch
to
turn
out
for
yourself
to
arrange
your
hammock
get
into
it
and
fairly
get
asleep
it
maybe
said
that
every
other
night
you
have
but
three
sleep
in
your
hammock
having
then
been
on
deck
for
twice
four
hours
at
eight
in
the
morning
your
comes
round
and
you
are
not
liable
to
duty
until
noon
under
like
circumstances
a
merchant
seaman
goes
to
his
and
has
the
benefit
of
a
good
long
sleep
but
in
a
you
can
do
no
such
thing
your
hammock
is
very
neatly
stowed
in
the
nettings
and
there
it
must
remain
till
nightfall
but
perhaps
there
is
a
corner
for
you
somewhere
along
the
batteries
on
the
where
you
may
enjoy
a
snug
nap
but
as
no
one
is
allowed
to
recline
on
the
larboard
side
of
the
which
is
reserved
as
a
corridor
for
the
officers
when
they
go
forward
to
their
at
the
the
starboard
side
only
is
left
to
the
seaman
but
most
of
this
side
also
is
occupied
by
the
carpenters
barbers
and
coopers
in
short
so
few
are
the
corners
where
you
can
snatch
a
nap
during
daytime
in
a
frigate
that
not
one
in
ten
of
the
watch
who
have
been
on
deck
eight
hours
can
get
a
wink
of
sleep
till
the
following
night
repeatedly
after
by
good
fortune
securing
a
corner
i
have
been
roused
from
it
by
some
functionary
commissioned
to
keep
it
clear
off
cape
horn
what
before
had
been
very
uncomfortable
became
a
serious
hardship
drenched
through
and
through
by
the
spray
of
the
sea
at
night
i
have
sometimes
slept
standing
on
the
shuddered
as
i
the
want
of
sufficient
sleep
in
my
hammock
during
three
days
of
the
stormiest
weather
we
were
given
the
privilege
of
the
at
other
times
strictly
interdicted
where
we
were
permitted
to
spread
our
jackets
and
take
a
nap
in
the
morning
after
the
eight
night
exposure
but
this
privilege
was
but
a
beggarly
one
indeed
not
to
speak
of
our
for
soaking
wet
the
spray
coming
down
the
hatchways
kept
the
planks
of
the
itself
constantly
wet
whereas
had
we
been
permitted
our
hammocks
we
might
have
swung
dry
over
all
this
deluge
but
we
endeavoured
to
make
ourselves
as
warm
and
comfortable
as
possible
chiefly
by
close
stowing
so
as
to
generate
a
little
steam
in
the
absence
of
any
warmth
you
have
seen
perhaps
the
way
in
which
they
box
up
subjects
intended
to
illustrate
the
winter
lectures
of
a
professor
of
surgery
just
so
we
laid
heel
and
point
face
to
back
into
each
other
at
every
ham
and
knee
the
wet
of
our
jackets
thus
densely
packed
would
soon
begin
to
distill
but
it
was
like
pouring
hot
water
on
you
to
keep
you
from
freezing
it
was
like
being
between
the
soaked
sheets
in
a
establishment
such
a
posture
could
not
be
preserved
for
any
considerable
period
without
shifting
side
for
side
three
or
four
times
during
the
four
hours
i
would
be
startled
from
a
wet
doze
by
the
hoarse
cry
of
a
fellow
who
did
the
duty
of
a
corporal
at
the
of
my
file
ahoy
stand
by
to
slew
round
and
with
a
double
shuffle
we
all
rolled
in
concert
and
found
ourselves
facing
the
taffrail
instead
of
the
bowsprit
but
however
you
turned
your
nose
was
sure
to
stick
to
one
or
other
of
the
steaming
backs
on
your
two
flanks
there
was
some
little
relief
in
the
change
of
odour
consequent
upon
this
but
what
is
the
reason
that
after
battling
out
eight
stormy
hours
on
deck
at
night
are
not
allowed
the
poor
boon
of
a
dry
four
nap
during
the
day
following
what
is
the
reason
the
commodore
captain
and
first
lieutenant
chaplain
purser
and
scores
of
others
have
night
just
as
if
they
were
staying
at
a
hotel
on
shore
and
the
junior
lieutenants
not
only
have
their
cots
to
go
to
at
any
time
but
as
only
one
of
them
is
required
to
head
the
watch
and
there
are
so
many
of
them
among
whom
to
divide
that
duty
they
are
only
on
deck
four
hours
to
twelve
hours
below
in
some
eases
the
proportion
is
still
greater
whereas
with
it
is
four
hours
in
and
four
hours
off
continually
what
is
the
reason
then
that
the
common
seamen
should
fare
so
hard
in
this
matter
it
would
seem
but
a
simple
thing
to
let
them
get
down
their
hammocks
during
the
day
for
a
nap
but
no
such
a
proceeding
would
mar
the
uniformity
of
daily
events
in
a
it
seems
indispensable
to
the
picturesque
effect
of
the
that
the
hammocks
should
invariably
remain
stowed
in
the
nettings
between
sunrise
and
sundown
but
the
chief
reason
is
reason
which
has
sanctioned
many
an
abuse
in
this
are
against
it
such
a
thing
as
sailors
sleeping
in
their
hammocks
in
the
daytime
after
being
eight
hours
exposed
to
a
was
hardly
ever
heard
of
in
the
navy
though
to
the
immortal
honour
of
some
captains
be
it
said
the
fact
is
upon
navy
record
that
off
cape
horn
they
vouchsafed
the
morning
hammocks
to
their
crew
heaven
bless
such
officers
and
may
they
and
their
or
sweet
and
pleasant
slumbers
while
they
live
and
an
undreaming
siesta
when
they
die
it
is
concerning
such
things
as
the
subject
of
this
chapter
that
special
enactments
of
congress
are
demanded
health
and
far
as
duly
attainable
under
the
be
legally
guaranteed
to
the
and
not
left
to
the
discretion
or
caprice
of
their
commanders
chapter
xxii
and
in
a
besides
the
other
tribulations
connected
with
your
hammock
you
must
keep
it
and
clean
who
has
not
observed
the
long
rows
of
spotless
hammocks
exposed
in
a
nettings
where
through
the
day
their
outsides
at
least
are
kept
airing
hence
it
comes
that
there
are
regular
mornings
appointed
for
the
scrubbing
of
hammocks
and
such
mornings
are
called
and
desperate
is
the
scrubbing
that
ensues
before
daylight
the
operation
begins
all
hands
are
called
and
at
it
they
go
every
deck
is
spread
with
hammocks
fore
and
aft
and
lucky
are
you
if
you
can
get
sufficient
superfices
to
spread
your
own
hammock
in
down
on
their
knees
are
five
hundred
men
scrubbing
away
with
brushes
and
brooms
jostling
and
crowding
and
quarrelling
about
using
each
suds
when
all
their
soap
goes
to
create
one
indiscriminate
yeast
sometimes
you
discover
that
in
the
dark
you
have
been
all
the
while
scrubbing
your
next
hammock
instead
of
your
own
but
it
is
too
late
to
begin
over
again
for
now
the
word
is
passed
for
every
man
to
advance
with
his
hammock
that
it
may
be
tied
to
a
of
and
hoisted
aloft
to
dry
that
done
without
delay
you
get
together
your
frocks
and
trowsers
and
on
the
already
flooded
deck
embark
in
the
laundry
business
you
have
no
special
bucket
or
basin
to
ship
being
one
vast
where
all
hands
wash
and
rinse
out
and
rinse
out
and
wash
till
at
last
the
word
is
passed
again
to
make
fast
your
clothes
that
they
also
may
be
elevated
to
dry
then
on
all
three
decks
the
operation
of
begins
so
called
from
the
queer
name
bestowed
upon
the
principal
instruments
employed
these
are
ponderous
flat
stones
with
long
ropes
at
each
end
by
which
the
stones
are
slidden
about
to
and
fro
over
the
wet
and
sanded
decks
a
most
wearisome
employment
for
the
byways
and
corners
about
the
masts
and
guns
smaller
stones
are
used
called
inasmuch
as
the
devout
operator
has
to
down
with
them
on
his
knees
finally
a
grand
flooding
takes
place
and
the
decks
are
remorselessly
thrashed
with
dry
swabs
after
which
an
extraordinary
sort
of
leathern
hoe
called
a
used
to
scrape
and
squeeze
the
last
dribblings
of
water
from
the
planks
concerning
this
i
think
something
of
drawing
up
a
memoir
and
reading
it
before
the
academy
of
arts
and
sciences
it
is
a
most
curious
affair
by
the
time
all
these
operations
are
concluded
it
is
and
all
hands
are
piped
to
breakfast
upon
the
damp
and
disagreeable
decks
now
against
this
invariable
daily
flooding
of
the
three
decks
of
a
frigate
as
a
most
earnestly
protests
in
sunless
weather
it
keeps
the
quarters
perpetually
damp
so
much
so
that
you
can
scarce
sit
down
without
running
the
risk
of
getting
the
lumbago
one
rheumatic
old
among
us
was
driven
to
the
extremity
of
sewing
a
piece
of
tarred
canvas
on
the
seat
of
his
trowsers
let
those
neat
and
tidy
officers
who
so
love
to
see
a
ship
kept
spick
and
span
clean
who
institute
vigorous
search
after
the
man
who
chances
to
drop
the
crumb
of
a
biscuit
on
deck
when
the
ship
is
rolling
in
a
let
all
such
swing
their
hammocks
with
the
sailors
and
they
would
soon
get
sick
of
this
daily
damping
of
the
decks
is
a
ship
a
wooden
platter
that
is
to
be
scrubbed
out
every
morning
before
breakfast
even
if
the
thermometer
be
at
zero
and
every
sailor
goes
barefooted
through
the
flood
with
the
chilblains
and
all
the
while
the
ship
carries
a
doctor
well
aware
of
great
maxim
the
feet
he
has
plenty
of
pills
to
give
you
when
you
are
down
with
a
fever
the
consequence
of
these
things
but
enters
no
protest
at
the
it
is
his
duty
to
the
cause
that
induces
the
fever
during
the
pleasant
night
watches
the
promenading
officers
mounted
on
their
boots
pass
like
the
israelites
over
the
decks
but
by
daybreak
the
roaring
tide
sets
back
and
the
poor
sailors
are
almost
overwhelmed
in
it
like
the
egyptians
in
the
red
sea
oh
the
chills
colds
and
agues
that
are
caught
no
snug
stove
grate
or
fireplace
to
go
to
no
your
only
way
to
keep
warm
is
to
keep
in
a
blazing
passion
and
anathematise
the
custom
that
every
morning
makes
a
of
a
look
at
it
say
you
go
on
board
a
you
see
everything
scrupulously
neat
you
see
all
the
decks
clear
and
unobstructed
as
the
sidewalks
of
wall
street
of
a
sunday
morning
you
see
no
trace
of
a
dormitory
you
marvel
by
what
magic
all
this
is
brought
about
and
well
you
may
for
consider
that
in
this
unobstructed
fabric
nearly
one
thousand
mortal
men
have
to
sleep
eat
wash
dress
cook
and
perform
all
the
ordinary
functions
of
humanity
the
same
number
of
men
ashore
would
expand
themselves
into
a
township
is
it
credible
then
that
this
extraordinary
neatness
and
especially
this
of
a
can
be
brought
about
except
by
the
most
rigorous
edicts
and
a
very
serious
sacrifice
with
respect
to
the
sailors
of
the
domestic
comforts
of
life
to
be
sure
sailors
themselves
do
not
often
complain
of
these
things
they
are
used
to
them
but
man
can
become
used
even
to
the
hardest
usage
and
it
is
because
he
is
used
to
it
that
sometimes
he
does
not
complain
of
it
of
all
the
american
ships
are
the
most
excessively
neat
and
have
the
greatest
reputation
for
it
and
of
all
the
general
discipline
of
the
american
ships
is
the
most
arbitrary
in
the
english
navy
the
men
liberally
mess
on
tables
which
between
meals
are
triced
up
out
of
the
way
the
american
sailors
mess
on
deck
and
pick
up
their
broken
biscuit
or
like
fowls
in
a
but
if
this
unobstructedness
in
an
american
be
at
all
hazards
so
desirable
why
not
imitate
the
turks
in
the
turkish
navy
they
have
no
the
sailors
roll
their
mess
things
up
in
a
rug
and
thrust
them
under
a
gun
nor
do
they
have
any
hammocks
they
sleep
anywhere
about
the
decks
in
their
indeed
come
to
look
at
it
what
more
does
a
absolutely
require
to
live
in
than
his
own
skin
room
enough
and
room
enough
to
turn
in
if
he
but
knew
how
to
shift
his
spine
end
for
end
like
a
ramrod
without
disturbing
his
next
neighbour
among
all
it
is
a
maxim
that
vessels
are
tartars
to
the
crew
and
perhaps
it
may
be
safely
laid
down
that
when
you
see
such
a
ship
some
sort
of
tyranny
is
not
very
far
off
in
the
neversink
as
in
other
national
ships
the
business
of
the
decks
was
often
prolonged
by
way
of
punishment
to
the
men
particularly
of
a
raw
cold
morning
this
is
one
of
the
punishments
which
a
lieutenant
of
the
watch
may
easily
inflict
upon
the
crew
without
infringing
the
statute
which
places
the
power
of
punishment
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
captain
the
abhorrence
which
have
for
this
protracted
in
cold
comfortless
their
bare
feet
exposed
to
the
splashing
shown
in
a
strange
story
rife
among
them
curiously
tinctured
with
their
proverbial
superstitions
the
first
lieutenant
of
an
english
sloop
of
war
a
severe
disciplinarian
was
uncommonly
particular
concerning
the
whiteness
of
the
one
bitter
winter
morning
at
sea
when
the
crew
had
washed
that
part
of
the
vessel
as
usual
and
put
away
their
this
officer
came
on
deck
and
after
inspecting
it
ordered
the
and
up
again
once
more
slipping
off
the
shoes
from
their
frosted
feet
and
rolling
up
their
trowsers
the
crew
kneeled
down
to
their
task
and
in
that
suppliant
posture
silently
invoked
a
curse
upon
their
tyrant
praying
as
he
went
below
that
he
might
never
more
come
out
of
the
alive
the
prayer
seemed
answered
for
shortly
after
being
visited
with
a
paralytic
stroke
at
his
the
first
lieutenant
next
morning
was
carried
out
of
the
feet
foremost
dead
as
they
dropped
him
over
the
goes
the
marine
sentry
at
the
gangway
turned
his
back
upon
the
corpse
to
the
credit
of
the
humane
and
sensible
portion
of
the
roll
of
american
be
it
added
that
are
not
so
particular
in
keeping
the
decks
spotless
at
all
times
and
in
all
weathers
nor
do
they
torment
the
men
with
scraping

desired

some
weeks
prior

from
three
years
before

time
here
spoken
of
the
seamen
had
clubbed
together
and
made
up
a
considerable
purse
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
a
theatrical
outfit
having
in
view
to
diversify
the
monotony
of
lying
in
foreign
harbours
for
weeks
together
by
an
occasional
display
on

that

and
her
planks

indeed
the
sailors
who
originated
this
scheme
had
served
in
other
american
frigates
where
the
privilege
of
having
theatricals
was
allowed
to
the
crew
what
was
their
chagrin
then
when
upon
making
an
application
to
the
captain
in
a
peruvian
harbour
for
permission
to
present
the
drama
of
ruffian
under
the
personal
patronage
that
dignitary
assured
them
that
there
were
already
enough
on
board
without
conjuring
up
any
more
from
the
the
theatrical
outfit
therefore
was
stowed
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
bags
who
little
anticipated
that
it
would
ever
be
dragged
out
while

claret
had
the
sway
but
immediately
upon
the
announcement
that
the
embargo
was
removed
vigorous
preparations
were
at
once
commenced
to
celebrate
the
fourth

unwonted
spirit
the

set
apart
for

and
the
was
commanded
to
loan
his
flags
to
decorate
it
in
the
most
patriotic
style
as
the
portion
of
the
crew
had
frequently
during
the
cruise
rehearsed
portions
of

plays

that
before

captain

ran
over

and
one
and
all
the

anticipated
a
gleeful
afternoon
and
thus
was
falsified
the
prophecies
of
certain
old
growlers
averse
to
theatricals

had
predicted
a

that
would
squash
all

ensued
during

amusing

were
anxious

anxious
glances
were
cast

struck
and
soon
after
all
who
could
be
spared
from
their
stations
hurried
to
the
the
capstan
bars
were
placed
on
as
at
prayers
on

furnishing
seats
for
the
audience
while
a
low
stage
rigged
by
the
gang
was
built
at
one
end
of
the
open
space
the
curtain
was
composed
of
a
large
ensign

the
bulwarks
round
about
were
draperied
with
the
flags
of
all

the
ten

twelve

ranged

the
foot
of

in

hands
while
the
consequential
captain
of
the
band
himself
was
elevated
upon
a
gun

at
three
bells
precisely
a
group
of
officers
emerged
from

and
seated
themselves
upon
in

position
with

and

looked
round
for

but
neither

nor

honored
with
their
presence
at
the
call
of
a
bugle
the

struck
up
the
whole
audience

as
at

when
save
the
is
played
after
a
great
national
victory
at
the
discharge
of
a
musket
the
curtain
rose
and
four
sailors
in
the
picturesque
garb
of

mariners
staggered
on
the
stage
in
a
feigned
state
of
intoxication

truthfulness
of

representation
was
much
heightened
by

roll
of

were
played
to
admiration
and
received
great
applause
but
at
the
first
appearance
of
that
universal
favourite
jack
chase
in
the
chivalric
character
of
the
whole
audience
simultaneously
rose
to
their
feet
and
greeted
hire
with
three
hearty
cheers
that
almost
took
the
aback
matchless
jack
full
bowed
again
and
again
with
true
grace
and
self
possession
and
when
five
or
six
untwisted
strands
of
rope
and
bunches
of
oakum
were
thrown
to
him
as
substitutes
for
bouquets
he
took
them
one
by
one
and
gallantly
hung
them
from
the
buttons
of
his
jacket
hurrah
hurrah
on
go
on
on
was
now
heard
on
all
sides
till
at
last
seeing
no
end
to
the
enthusiasm
of
his
ardent
admirers
matchless
jack
stepped
forward
and
with
his
lips
moving
in
pantomime
plunged
into
the
thick
of
the
part
silence
soon
followed
but
was
fifty
times
broken
by
uncontrollable
bursts
of
applause
at
length
when
that
scene
came
on
where
percy
rescues
fifteen
oppressed
sailors
from
the
in
the
teeth
of
a
posse
of
constables
the
audience
leaped
to
their
feet
overturned
the
capstan
bars
and
to
a
man
hurled
their
hats
on
the
stage
in
a
delirium
of
delight
ah
jack
that
was
a
indeed
the
commotion
was
now
terrific
all
discipline
seemed
gone
for
ever
the
lieutenants
ran
in
among
the
men
the
captain
darted
from
his
cabin
and
the
commodore
nervously
questioned
the
armed
sentry
at
his
door
as
to
what
the
deuce
were
about
in
the
midst
of
all
this
the
trumpet
of
the
commanding
the
sails
to
be
taken
in
was
almost
completely
drowned
a
black
squall
was
coming
down
on
the
and
the
mates
bellowed
themselves
hoarse
at
the
there
is
no
knowing
what
would
have
ensued
had
not
the
bass
drum
suddenly
been
heard
calling
all
hands
to
quarters
a
summons
not
to
be
withstood
the
sailors
pricked
their
ears
at
it
as
horses
at
the
sound
of
a
cracking
whip
and
confusedly
stumbled
up
the
ladders
to
their
stations
the
next
moment
all
was
silent
but
the
wind
howling
like
a
thousand
devils
in
the
cordage
by
to
reef
all
three
away
the
halyards
make
fast
and
reef
away
thus
in
storm
and
tempest
terminated
that
theatricals
but
the
sailors
never
recovered
from
the
disappointment
of
not
having
the
yankee
sung
by
the
irish
captain
of
the
head
and
here
must
moralize
a
bit
the
unwonted
spectacle
of
the
row
of
officers
mingling
with
in
applauding
a
mere
seaman
like
jack
chase
filled
me
at
the
time
with
the
most
pleasurable
emotions
it
is
a
sweet
thing
thought
i
to
see
these
officers
confess
a
human
brotherhood
with
us
after
all
a
sweet
thing
to
mark
their
cordial
appreciation
of
the
manly
merits
of
my
matchless
jack
ah
they
are
noble
fellows
all
round
and
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
wronged
them
sometimes
in
my
thoughts
nor
was
it
without
similar
pleasurable
feelings
that
i
witnessed
the
temporary
rupture
of
the
stern
discipline
consequent
upon
the
tumult
of
the
theatricals
i
thought
to
myself
this
now
is
as
it
should
be
it
is
good
to
shake
off
now
and
then
this
iron
yoke
round
our
necks
and
after
having
once
permitted
us
sailors
to
be
a
little
noisy
in
a
harmless
merrily
officers
can
not
with
any
good
grace
be
so
excessively
stern
and
unyielding
as
before
i
began
to
think
a
a
after
all
but
alas
disappointment
came
next
morning
the
same
old
scene
was
enacted
at
the

disposed

said
all
round

their
faces
but
this
is
the
i
afterward
learned
that

an
old
phrase
expressive
of
the
facility
with
which

back
upon

the
severity

before

previous

passages
had
been
made
to
the
pacific
by
the
straits
of
magellan
nor
indeed
at
that
period
was
it
known
to
a
certainty
that
there
was
any
other
route
or
that
the
land
now
called

was
an

a
cluster
of

between
which
and
the

are
the

so
called

of

discoverer
who
first
sailed
through
them
into
the
pacific
le

and
schouten
in
their
small
clumsy
vessels
encountered
a
series
of
tremendous
gales
the
prelude
to
the
long
train
of
similar
hardships
which
most
of
their
followers
have
experienced
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
vessel
the
which
gave
its
name
to
the
cape
was
almost
lost
in
weathering
it
the
next
navigator
round
the
cape
was
sir
francis
drake
who
on
expedition
beholding
for
the
first
time
from
the
isthmus
of
darien
the
south
sea
like
a
englishman
vowed
please
god
to
sail
an
english
ship
thereon
which
the
gallant
sailor
did
to
the
sore
discomfiture
of
the
spaniards
on
the
coasts
of
chili
and
peru
but
perhaps
the
greatest
hardships
on
record
in
making
this
celebrated
passage
were
those
experienced
by
lord
squadron
in
three
remarkable
and
most
interesting
narratives
record
their
disasters
and
sufferings
the
first
jointly
written
by
the
carpenter
and
gunner
of
the
wager
the
second
by
young
byron
a
midshipman
in
the

the
third

of

they

must
have
been
written
with
an
icicle
at
the
present
day
the
horrors
of
the
cape
have
somewhat
abated
this
is
owing
to
a
growing
familiarity
with
it
but
more
than
all
to
the
improved
condition
of

in
all
respects
and

pulled
down
vigorously
at

to
bring

well
over

alas
those

were

scanty

the

stuffed

by

shrink
woefully
all
over

in

that
the

had
gradually
crawled
up

to

it
required
an
energetic
thrust
to
push
the

through

endeavoured
to
amend
these
misfortunes
by
sewing
a
sort
of

round

colder

colder
till
at
last
we
spoke
a
fleet
of
icebergs
bound
north
after
that
it
was
one
incessant
that
almost
snapped
off
our
fingers
and
toes
cold
it
was
cold
as
where
sailors
say
fire
freezes
and
now
coming
up
with
the
latitude
of
the
cape
we
stood
southward
to
give
it
a
wide
berth
and
while
so
doing
were
becalmed
ay
becalmed
off

which
is
worse
far
worse
than
being
becalmed
on

line
here
we
lay
hours
during
which
the
cold
was
intense
i
wondered
at
the
liquid
sea
which
refused
to
freeze
in
such
a
temperature
the
clear
cold
sky
overhead
looked
like
a
cymbal
that
might
ring
could
you
smite
it
our
breath
came
and
went
like
of
smoke
from
at
first
there
was
a
long
gauky
swell
that
obliged
us
to
furl
most
of
the
sails
and
even
send
down
for
fear
of
pitching
them
overboard
out
of
sight
of

at
this
extremity
of
both
the
inhabitable
and
uninhabitable
world
our
peopled
frigate
echoing
with
the
voices
of
men
the
bleating
of
lambs
the
cackling
of
fowls
the
gruntings
of
pigs
seemed
like
old
ark
itself
becalmed
at
the
climax
of
the
deluge
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
patiently
to
await
the
pleasure
of
the
elements
and
for
a
wind
the
usual
practice
of
seamen
in
a
calm
no
fire
was
allowed
except
for
the
indispensable
purpose
of
cooking
and
heating
bottles
of
water
to
toast
feet
he
who
possessed
the
largest
stock
of
vitality
stood
the
best
chance
to
escape
freezing
it
was
horrifying
in
such
weather
any
man
could
have
undergone
amputation
with
great
ease
and
helped
take
up
the
arteries
himself
indeed
this
state
of
affairs
had
not
lasted
quite
hours
when
the
extreme
frigidity
of
the
air
united
to
our
increased
tendency
to
inactivity
would
very
soon
have
rendered
some
of
us
subjects
for
the
surgeon
and
his
mates
had
not
a
humane
proceeding
of
the
captain
suddenly
impelled
us
to
vigorous
exercise
and
here
be
it
said
that
the
appearance
of
the
with
his
silver
whistle
to
his
mouth
at
the
main
hatchway
of
the
is
always
regarded
by
the
crew
with
the
utmost
curiosity
for
this
betokens
that
some
general
order
is
about
to
be
promulgated
through
the
ship
what
now
is
the
question
that
runs
on
from
man
to
man
a
short
preliminary
whistle
is
then
given
by
yarn
as
they
call
him
which
whistle
serves
to
collect
round
him
from
their
various
stations
his
four
mates
then
yarn
or
pipes
as
leader
of
the
orchestra
begins
a
peculiar
call
in
which
his
assistants
join
this
over
the
order
whatever
it
may
be
is
loudly
sung
out
and
prolonged
till
the
remotest
corner
echoes
again
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
are
the
of
a
the
calm
had
commenced
in
the
afternoon
and
the
following
morning
the
company
were
electrified
by
a
general
order
thus
set
forth
and
declared
hear
there
for
and
aft
all
hands
skylark
this
mandate
nowadays
never
used
except
upon
very
rare
occasions
produced
the
same
effect
upon
the
men
that
exhilarating
gas
would
have
done
or
an
extra
allowance
of
for
a
time
the
wonted
discipline
of
the
ship
was
broken
through
and
perfect
license
allowed
it
was
a
babel
here
a
bedlam
there
and
a
pandemonium
everywhere
the
theatricals
were
nothing
compared
with
it
then
the
and
timorous
crawled
to
their
and
the
lusty
and
bold
shouted
forth
their
glee
gangs
of
men
in
all
sorts
of
outlandish
habiliments
wild
as
those
worn
at
some
crazy
carnival
rushed
to
and
fro
seizing
upon
whomsoever
they
and
dangerous
pugilists
and
hauling
the
luckless
tars
about
till
fairly
baited
into
a
genial
warmth
some
were
made
fast
to
and
hoisted
aloft
with
a
will
others
mounted
upon
oars
were
ridden
fore
and
aft
on
a
rail
to
the
boisterous
mirth
of
the
spectators
any
one
of
whom
might
be
the
next
victim
swings
were
rigged
from
the
tops
or
the
masts
and
the
most
reluctant
wights
being
purposely
selected
spite
of
all
struggles
were
swung
from
east
to
west
in
vast
arcs
of
circles
till
almost
breathless
hornpipes
fandangoes
reels
and
quadrilles
were
danced
under
the
very
nose
of
the
most
mighty
captain
and
upon
the
very
and
poop
sparring
and
wrestling
too
were
all
the
vogue
were
given
and
the
exchanged
the
din
frightened
the
that
flew
by
with
accelerated
wing
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
several
casualties
occurred
of
which
however
i
will
relate
but
one
while
the
was
at
its
height
one
of
the
devil
of
a
portuguese
looking
that
he
would
be
the
death
of
any
man
who
laid
violent
hands
upon
his
inviolable
person
this
threat
being
overheard
a
band
of
desperadoes
coming
up
from
behind
tripped
him
up
in
an
instant
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
portuguese
was
straddling
an
oar
borne
aloft
by
an
uproarious
multitude
who
rushed
him
along
the
deck
at
a
railroad
gallop
the
living
mass
of
arms
all
round
and
beneath
him
was
so
dense
that
every
time
he
inclined
one
side
he
was
instantly
pushed
upright
but
only
to
fall
over
again
to
receive
another
push
from
the
contrary
direction
presently
disengaging
his
hands
from
those
who
held
them
the
enraged
seaman
drew
from
his
bosom
an
iron
and
recklessly
laid
about
him
to
right
and
left
most
of
his
persecutors
fled
but
some
eight
or
ten
still
stood
their
ground
and
while
bearing
him
aloft
endeavoured
to
wrest
the
weapon
from
his
hands
in
this
attempt
one
man
was
struck
on
the
head
and
dropped
insensible
he
was
taken
up
for
dead
and
carried
below
to
cuticle
the
surgeon
while
the
portuguese
was
put
under
guard
but
the
wound
did
not
prove
very
serious
and
in
a
few
days
the
man
was
walking
about
the
deck
with
his
head
well
bandaged
this
occurrence
put
an
end
to
the
further
being
strictly
prohibited
in
due
time
the
portuguese
paid
the
penalty
of
his
rashness
at
the
gangway
while
once
again
the
officers

a
sail
had
been
discerned
from

a
great
distance
probably
three
leagues
or
more
at
first
it
was
a
mere
speck
altogether
out
of
sight
from
the
deck
by
the
force
of
attraction
or
something
else
equally
inscrutable
two

in

and
equally
affected

the
currents
will
always
approximate
more
or
less
though
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
it
was
not
a
great
while
before
the
strange
sail
was
descried
from
our
bulwarks
gradually
it
drew
still
nearer
what
was
she
and
whence
there
is
no
object
which
so
excites
interest
and
conjecture
and
at
the

baffles
both

for

perceptibly
nearing

aloft
to

faintly
began
to
distend

toward
sunset
the

down
before

a

audaciously
insulted

an

our

admonition

of

the

was
lost
in

with

by
no

the

became

it

with
us
about
midnight
when
the

was
heard
followed
by
the
shrill
cry
of

and
save

springing
from
our
hammocks
we
found
the
frigate
leaning
over
to
it
so
steeply
that
it
was
with
difficulty
we
could
climb
the
ladders
leading
to
the
upper
deck
here
the
scene
was
awful
the
vessel
seemed
to
be
sailing
on
her
side
the
guns
had
several
days
previous
been
run
in
and
housed
and
the
closed
but
the
lee
carronades
on
the
and
forecastle
were
plunging
through
the
sea
which
undulated
over
them
in
billows
of
foam
with
every
lurch
to
leeward
the
seemed
to
dip
in
the
sea
while
forward
the
spray
dashed
over
the
bows
in
cataracts
and
drenched
the
men
who
were
on
the
by
this
time
the
deck
was
alive
with
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
five
hundred
men
officers
and
all
mostly
clinging
to
the
weather
bulwarks
the
occasional
phosphorescence
of
the
yeasting
sea
cast
a
glare
upon
their
uplifted
faces
as
a
night
fire
in
a
populous
city
lights
up
the
crowd
in
a
sudden
gale
or
when
a
large
quantity
of
sail
is
suddenly
to
be
furled
it
is
the
custom
for
the
first
lieutenant
to
take
the
trumpet
from
whoever
happens
then
to
be
officer
of
the
deck
but
mad
jack
had
the
trumpet
that
watch
nor
did
the
first
lieutenant
now
seek
to
wrest
it
from
his
hands
every
eye
was
upon
him
as
if
we
had
chosen
him
from
among
us
all
to
decide
this
battle
with
the
elements
by
single
combat
with
the
spirit
of
the
cape
for
mad
jack
was
the
saving
genius
of
the
ship
and
so
proved
himself
that
night
i
owe
this
right
hand
that
is
this
moment
flying
over
my
sheet
and
all
my
present
being
to
mad
jack
the
bows
were
now
butting
battering
ramming
and
thundering
over
and
upon
the
head
seas
and
with
a
horrible
wallowing
sound
our
whole
hull
was
rolling
in
the
trough
of
the
foam
the
gale
came
athwart
the
deck
and
every
sail
seemed
bursting
with
its
wild
breath
all
the
and
several
of
the
were
swarming
round
the
on
the
some
jumping
up
and
down
with
their
hands
upon
the
spokes
for
the
whole
helm
and
galvanised
keel
were
fiercely
feverish
with
the
life
imparted
to
them
by
the
tempest
the
helm
shouted
captain
claret
bursting
from
his
cabin
like
a
ghost
in
his
you
raged
mad
jack
to
the
i
say
and
be
damned
to
you
contrary
orders
but
mad
were
obeyed
his
object
was
to
throw
the
ship
into
the
wind
so
as
the
better
to
admit
of
the
but
though
the
halyards
were
let
go
it
was
impossible
to
clew
down
the
yards
owing
to
the
enormous
horizontal
strain
on
the
canvas
it
now
blew
a
hurricane
the
spray
flew
over
the
ship
in
floods
the
gigantic
masts
seemed
about
to
snap
under
the
strain
of
the
three
entire
down
clew
down
shouted
mad
jack
husky
with
excitement
and
in
a
frenzy
beating
his
trumpet
against
one
of
the
shrouds
but
owing
to
the
slant
of
the
ship
the
thing
could
not
be
done
it
was
obvious
that
before
many
minutes
something
must
sails
rigging
or
sticks
perhaps
the
hull
itself
and
all
hands
presently
a
voice
from
the
top
exclaimed
that
there
was
a
rent
in
the
and
instantly
we
heard
a
report
like
two
or
three
muskets
discharged
together
the
vast
sail
was
rent
up
and
down
like
the
vail
of
the
temple
this
saved
the
for
the
yard
was
now
clewed
down
with
comparative
ease
and
the
laid
out
to
stow
the
shattered
canvas
soon
the
two
remaining
were
also
clewed
down
and
close
reefed
above
all
the
roar
of
the
tempest
and
the
shouts
of
the
crew
was
heard
the
dismal
tolling
of
the
as
large
as
that
of
a
village
the
violent
rolling
of
the
ship
was
occasioning
imagination
can
not
conceive
the
horror
of
such
a
sound
in
a
at
sea
that
ghost
roared
mad
jack
one
of
you
and
wrench
off
the
clapper
but
no
sooner
was
this
ghost
gagged
than
a
still
more
appalling
sound
was
heard
the
rolling
to
and
fro
of
the
heavy
shot
which
on
the
had
broken
loose
from
the
and
converted
that
part
of
the
ship
into
an
immense
some
hands
were
sent
down
to
secure
them
but
it
was
as
much
as
their
lives
were
worth
several
were
maimed
and
the
midshipmen
who
were
ordered
to
see
the
duty
performed
reported
it
impossible
until
the
storm
abated
the
most
terrific
job
of
all
was
to
furl
the
which
at
the
commencement
of
the
squalls
had
been
clewed
up
coaxed
and
quieted
as
much
as
possible
with
the
and
mad
jack
waited
some
time
for
a
lull
ere
he
gave
an
order
so
perilous
to
be
executed
for
to
furl
this
enormous
sail
in
such
a
gale
required
at
least
fifty
men
on
the
yard
whose
weight
superadded
to
that
of
the
ponderous
stick
itself
still
further
jeopardised
their
lives
but
there
was
no
prospect
of
a
cessation
of
the
gale
and
the
order
was
at
last
given
at
this
time
a
hurricane
of
slanting
sleet
and
hail
was
descending
upon
us
the
rigging
was
coated
with
a
thin
glare
of
ice
formed
within
the
hour
and
all
you
and
furl
the
cried
mad
jack
i
dashed
down
my
hat
slipped
out
of
my
quilted
jacket
in
an
instant
kicked
the
shoes
from
my
feet
and
with
a
crowd
of
others
sprang
for
the
rigging
above
the
bulwarks
which
in
a
frigate
are
so
high
as
to
afford
much
protection
to
those
on
deck
the
gale
was
horrible
the
sheer
force
of
the
wind
flattened
us
to
the
rigging
as
we
ascended
and
every
hand
seemed
congealing
to
the
icy
shrouds
by
which
we
held
my
brave
hearties
shouted
mad
jack
and
up
we
got
some
way
or
other
all
of
us
and
groped
our
way
out
on
the
on
every
son
cried
an
old
at
my
side
he
was
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
compass
but
in
the
gale
he
seemed
to
be
whispering
and
i
only
heard
him
from
his
being
right
to
windward
of
me
but
his
hint
was
unnecessary
i
dug
my
nails
into
the
and
swore
that
nothing
but
death
should
part
me
and
them
until
i
was
able
to
turn
round
and
look
to
windward
as
yet
this
was
impossible
i
could
scarcely
hear
the
man
to
leeward
at
my
elbow
the
wind
seemed
to
snatch
the
words
from
his
mouth
and
fly
away
with
them
to
the
south
pole
all
this
while
the
sail
itself
was
flying
about
sometimes
catching
over
our
heads
and
threatening
to
tear
us
from
the
yard
in
spite
of
all
our
hugging
for
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
thus
hung
suspended
right
over
the
rampant
billows
which
curled
their
very
crests
under
the
feet
of
some
four
or
five
of
us
clinging
to
the
as
if
to
float
us
from
our
place
presently
the
word
passed
along
the
yard
from
that
we
were
ordered
to
come
down
and
leave
the
sail
to
blow
since
it
could
not
be
furled
a
midshipman
it
seemed
had
been
sent
up
by
the
officer
of
the
deck
to
give
the
order
as
no
trumpet
could
be
heard
where
we
were
those
on
the
weather
managed
to
crawl
upon
the
spar
and
scramble
down
the
rigging
but
with
us
upon
the
extreme
leeward
side
this
feat
was
out
of
the
question
it
was
literary
like
climbing
a
precipice
to
get
to
in
order
to
reach
the
shrouds
besides
the
entire
yard
was
now
encased
in
ice
and
our
hands
and
feet
were
so
numb
that
we
dared
not
trust
our
lives
to
them
nevertheless
by
assisting
each
other
we
contrived
to
throw
ourselves
prostrate
along
the
yard
and
embrace
it
with
our
arms
and
legs
in
this
position
the
greatly
assisted
in
securing
our
hold
strange
as
it
may
appear
i
do
not
suppose
that
at
this
moment
the
slightest
sensation
of
fear
was
felt
by
one
man
on
that
yard
we
clung
to
it
with
might
and
main
but
this
was
instinct
the
truth
is
that
in
circumstances
like
these
the
sense
of
fear
is
annihilated
in
the
unutterable
sights
that
fill
all
the
eye
and
the
sounds
that
fill
all
the
ear
you
become
identified
with
the
tempest
your
insignificance
is
lost
in
the
riot
of
the
stormy
universe
around
below
us
our
noble
frigate
seemed
thrice
its
real
vast
black
wedge
opposing
its
widest
end
to
the
combined
fury
of
the
sea
and
wind
at
length
the
first
fury
of
the
gale
began
to
abate
and
we
at
once
fell
to
pounding
our
hands
as
a
preliminary
operation
to
going
to
work
for
a
gang
of
men
had
now
ascended
to
help
secure
what
was
left
of
the
sail
we
somehow
packed
it
away
at
last
and
came
down
about
noon
the
next
day
the
gale
so
moderated
that
we
shook
two
reefs
out
of
the
set
new
courses
and
stood
due
east
with
the
wind
astern
thus
all
the
fine
weather
we
encountered
after
first
weighing
anchor
on
the
pleasant
spanish
coast
was
but
the
prelude
to
this
one
terrific
night
more
especially
that
treacherous
calm
immediately
preceding
it
but
how
could
we
reach
our
homes
without
encountering
cape
horn
by
what
possibility
avoid
it
and
though
some
ships
have
weathered
it
without
these
perils
yet
by
far
the
greater
part
must
encounter
them
lucky
it
is
that
it
comes
about
midway
in
the
passage
so
that
the
sailors
have
time
to
prepare
for
it
and
time
to
recover
from
it
after
it
is
astern
but
sailor
or
landsman
there
is
some
sort
of
a
cape
horn
for
all
boys
beware
of
it
prepare
for
it
in
time
thank
god
it
is
passed
and
ye
lucky
livers
to
whom
by
some
rare
fatality
your
cape
horns
are
placid
as
lake
lemans
flatter
not
yourselves
that
good
luck
is
judgment
and
discretion
for
all
the
yolk
in
your
eggs
you
might
have
foundered
and
gone
down
had
the
spirit
of
the
cape
said
the
word
chapter
xxvii
some
thoughts
growing
out
of
mad
countermanding
his
order
in
time
of
peril
like
the
needle
to
the
loadstone
obedience
irrespective
of
rank
generally
flies
to
him
who
is
best
fitted
to
command
the
truth
of
this
seemed
evinced
in
the
case
of
mad
jack
during
the
gale
and
especially
at
that
perilous
moment
when
he
countermanded
the
order
at
the
helm
but
every
seaman
knew
at
the
time
that
the
order
was
an
unwise
one
in
the
extreme
perhaps
worse
than
unwise
these
two
orders
given
by
the
captain
and
his
lieutenant
exactly
contrasted
their
characters
by
putting
the
helm
the
captain
was
for
that
is
for
flying
away
from
the
gale
whereas
mad
jack
was
for
running
the
ship
into
its
teeth
it
is
needless
to
say
that
in
almost
all
cases
of
similar
hard
squalls
and
gales
the
latter
step
though
attended
with
more
appalling
appearances
is
in
reality
the
safer
of
the
two
and
the
most
generally
adopted
scudding
makes
you
a
slave
to
the
blast
which
drives
you
headlong
before
it
but
up
into
the
enables
you
in
a
degree
to
hold
it
at
bay
scudding
exposes
to
the
gale
your
stern
the
weakest
part
of
your
hull
the
contrary
course
presents
to
it
your
bows
your
strongest
part
as
with
ships
so
with
men
he
who
turns
his
back
to
his
foe
gives
him
an
advantage
whereas
our
ribbed
chests
like
the
ribbed
bows
of
a
frigate
are
as
bulkheads
to
dam
off
an
onset
that
night
off
the
pitch
of
the
cape
captain
claret
was
hurried
forth
from
his
disguises
and
at
a
conjuncture
appeared
in
his
true
colours
a
thing
which
every
man
in
the
ship
had
long
suspected
that
night
was
proved
true
hitherto
in
going
about
the
ship
and
casting
his
glances
among
the
men
the
peculiarly
lustreless
repose
of
the
slow
even
unnecessarily
methodical
step
and
the
forced
firmness
of
his
whole
to
a
casual
observer
expressive
of
the
consciousness
of
command
and
a
desire
to
strike
subjection
among
the
this
to
some
minds
had
only
been
deemed
indications
of
the
fact
that
captain
claret
while
carefully
shunning
positive
excesses
continually
kept
himself
in
an
uncertain
equilibrio
between
soberness
and
its
reverse
which
equilibrio
might
be
destroyed
by
the
first
sharp
vicissitude
of
events
and
though
this
is
only
a
surmise
nevertheless
as
having
some
knowledge
of
brandy
and
mankind
will
venture
to
state
that
had
captain
claret
been
an
temperance
man
he
would
never
have
given
that
most
imprudent
order
to
the
helm
he
would
either
have
held
his
peace
and
stayed
in
his
cabin
like
his
gracious
majesty
the
commodore
or
else
have
anticipated
mad
order
and
thundered
forth
down
the
helm
to
show
how
little
real
sway
at
times
have
the
severest
restrictive
laws
and
how
spontaneous
is
the
instinct
of
discretion
in
some
minds
it
must
here
be
added
that
though
mad
jack
under
a
hot
impulse
had
countermanded
an
order
of
his
superior
officer
before
his
very
face
yet
that
severe
article
of
war
to
which
he
thus
rendered
himself
obnoxious
was
never
enforced
against
him
nor
so
far
as
any
of
the
crew
ever
knew
did
the
captain
even
venture
to
reprimand
him
for
his
temerity
it
has
been
said
that
mad
jack
himself
was
a
lover
of
strong
drink
so
he
was
but
here
we
only
see
the
virtue
of
being
placed
in
a
station
constantly
demanding
a
cool
head
and
steady
nerves
and
the
misfortune
of
filling
a
post
that
does
at
all
times
demand
these
qualities
so
exact
and
methodical
in
most
things
was
the
discipline
of
the
frigate
that
to
a
certain
extent
captain
claret
was
exempted
from
personal
interposition
in
many
of
its
current
events
and
thereby
perhaps
was
he
lulled
into
security
under
the
enticing
lee
of
his
decanter
but
as
for
mad
jack
he
must
stand
his
regular
watches
and
pace
the
at
night
and
keep
a
sharp
eye
to
windward
hence
at
sea
mad
jack
tried
to
make
a
point
of
keeping
sober
though
in
very
fine
weather
he
was
sometimes
betrayed
into
a
glass
too
many
but
with
cape
horn
before
him
he
took
the
temperance
pledge
outright
till
that
perilous
promontory
should
be
far
astern
the
leading
incident
of
the
gale
irresistibly
invites
the
question
are
there
incompetent
officers
in
the
american
navy
is
incompetent
to
the
due
performance
of
whatever
duties
may
devolve
upon
them
but
in
that
gallant
marine
which
during
the
late
war
gained
so
much
of
what
is
called
can
there
possibly
be
incompetent
officers
as
in
the
camp
ashore
so
on
the
at
trumpets
of
one
victory
drown
the
muffled
drums
of
a
thousand
defeats
and
in
degree
this
holds
true
of
those
events
of
war
which
are
neuter
in
their
character
neither
making
renown
nor
disgrace
besides
as
a
long
array
of
ciphers
led
by
but
one
solitary
numeral
swell
by
mere
force
of
aggregation
into
an
immense
arithmetical
sum
even
so
in
some
brilliant
actions
do
a
crowd
of
officers
each
inefficient
in
himself
aggregate
renown
when
banded
together
and
led
by
a
numeral
nelson
or
a
wellington
and
the
renown
of
such
heroes
by
outliving
themselves
descends
as
a
heritage
to
their
subordinate
survivors
one
large
brain
and
one
large
heart
have
virtue
sufficient
to
magnetise
a
whole
fleet
or
an
army
and
if
all
the
men
who
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
have
mainly
contributed
to
the
warlike
successes
or
reverses
of
nations
were
now
mustered
together
we
should
be
amazed
to
behold
but
a
handful
of
heroes
for
there
is
no
heroism
in
merely
running
in
and
out
a
gun
at
a
enveloped
in
smoke
or
vapour
or
in
firing
off
muskets
in
platoons
at
the
word
of
command
this
kind
of
merely
manual
valour
is
often
born
of
trepidation
at
the
heart
there
may
be
men
individually
craven
who
united
may
display
even
temerity
yet
it
would
be
false
to
deny
that
in
some
the
lowest
privates
have
acquitted
themselves
with
even
more
gallantry
than
their
commodores
true
heroism
is
not
in
the
hand
but
in
the
heart
and
the
head
but
are
there
incompetent
officers
in
the
gallant
american
navy
for
an
american
the
question
is
of
no
grateful
cast
white
jacket
must
again
evade
it
by
referring
to
an
historical
fact
in
the
history
of
a
kindred
marine
which
from
its
long
standing
and
magnitude
furnishes
many
more
examples
of
all
kinds
than
our
own
and
this
is
the
only
reason
why
it
is
ever
referred
to
in
this
narrative
i
thank
god
i
am
free
from
all
national
invidiousness
it
is
indirectly
on
record
in
the
books
of
the
english
admiralty
that
in
the
year
the
death
of
lord
lord
collingwood
commanded
on
the
mediterranean
station
and
his
broken
health
induced
him
to
solicit
a
furlough
that
out
of
a
list
of
upward
of
one
hundred
admirals
not
a
single
officer
was
found
who
was
deemed
qualified
to
relieve
the
applicant
with
credit
to
the
country
this
fact
collingwood
sealed
with
his
life
for
hopeless
of
being
recalled
he
shortly
after
died
worn
out
at
his
post
now
if
this
was
the
case
in
so
renowned
a
marine
as
what
must
be
inferred
with
respect
to
our
own
but
herein
no
special
disgrace
is
involved
for
the
truth
is
that
to
be
an
accomplished
and
skillful
naval
generalissimo
needs
natural
capabilities
of
an
uncommon
order
still
more
it
may
safely
be
asserted
that
worthily
to
command
even
a
frigate
requires
a
degree
of
natural
heroism
talent
judgment
and
integrity
that
is
denied
to
mediocrity
yet
these
qualifications
are
not
only
required
but
demanded
and
no
one
has
a
right
to
be
a
naval
captain
unless
he
possesses
them
regarding
lieutenants
there
are
not
a
few
selvagees
and
paper
jacks
in
the
american
navy
many
commodores
know
that
they
have
seldom
taken
a
ship
to
sea
without
feeling
more
or
less
nervousness
when
some
of
the
lieutenants
have
the
deck
at
night
according
to
the
last
navy
register
there
are
now
captains
in
the
american
navy
collectively
drawing
about
annually
from
the
public
treasury
also
commanders
drawing
about
and
lieutenants
drawing
about
half
a
million
and
midshipmen
including
also
drawing
nearly
half
a
million
considering
the
known
facts
that
some
of
these
officers
are
seldom
or
never
sent
to
sea
owing
to
the
navy
department
being
well
aware
of
their
inefficiency
that
others
are
detailed
for
work
at
observatories
and
solvers
of
logarithms
in
the
coast
survey
while
the
really
meritorious
officers
who
are
accomplished
practical
seamen
are
known
to
be
sent
from
ship
to
ship
with
but
small
interval
of
a
furlough
considering
all
this
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
no
small
portion
of
the
million
and
a
half
of
money
above
mentioned
is
annually
paid
to
national
pensioners
in
disguise
who
live
on
the
navy
without
serving
it
nothing
like
this
can
be
even
insinuated
against
the
gunners
etc
nor
against
the
of
the
tops
etc
nor
against
the
able
seamen
in
the
navy
for
if
any
of
are
found
wanting
they
are
forthwith
disrated
or
discharged
true
all
experience
teaches
that
whenever
there
is
a
great
national
establishment
employing
large
numbers
of
officials
the
public
must
be
reconciled
to
support
many
incompetent
men
for
such
is
the
favouritism
and
nepotism
always
prevailing
in
the
purlieus
of
these
establishments
that
some
incompetent
persons
are
always
admitted
to
the
exclusion
of
many
of
the
worthy
nevertheless
in
a
country
like
ours
boasting
of
the
political
equality
of
all
social
conditions
it
is
a
great
reproach
that
such
a
thing
as
a
common
seaman
rising
to
the
rank
of
a
commissioned
officer
in
our
navy
is
nowadays
almost
yet
in
former
times
when
officers
have
so
risen
to
rank
they
have
generally
proved
of
signal
usefulness
in
the
service
and
sometimes
have
reflected
solid
honour
upon
the
country
instances
in
point
might
be
mentioned
is
it
not
well
to
have
our
institutions
of
a
piece
any
american
landsman
may
hope
to
become
president
of
the
of
our
squadron
of
states
and
every
american
sailor
should
be
placed
in
such
a
position
that
he
might
freely
aspire
to
command
a
squadron
of
frigates

and
we
are

bound
what
care
the
jolly
crew
it
is
worth
mentioning
here
that
in
nineteen
cases
out
of
twenty
a
passage
from
the
pacific
round
the
cape
is
almost
sure
to
be
much
shorter
and
attended
with
less
hardship
than
a
passage
undertaken
from
the
atlantic
the
reason
is
that
the
gales
are
mostly
from
the
westward
also
the
currents
but
after
all
going
before
the
wind
in
a
frigate
in
such
a
tempest
has
its
annoyances
and
drawbacks
as
well
as
many
other
blessings
the
disproportionate
weight
of
metal
upon
the
spar
and
gun
decks
induces
a
violent
rolling
unknown
to
merchant
ships
we
rolled
and
rolled
on
our
way
like
the
world
in
its
orbit
shipping
green
seas
on
both
sides
until
the
old
frigate
dipped
and
went
into
it
like
a
the
hatchways
of
some
armed
vessels
are
but
poorly
secured
in
bad
weather
this
was
peculiarly
the
ease
with
those
of
the
neversink
they
were
merely
spread
over
with
an
old
tarpaulin
cracked
and
rent
in
every
direction
in
fair
weather
the
company
messed
on
the
but
as
this
was
now
flooded
almost
continually
we
were
obliged
to
take
our
meals
upon
the
the
next
one
below
one
day
the
messes
of
the
were
seated
here
at
dinner
forming
little
groups
twelve
or
fifteen
men
in
each
reclining
about
the
and
their
pots
and
pans
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
ship
was
seized
with
such
a
paroxysm
of
rolling
that
in
a
single
instant
everything
on
the
kids
sailors
pieces
of
beef
and
tossed
indiscriminately
from
side
to
side
it
was
impossible
to
stay
self
there
was
nothing
but
the
bare
deck
to
cling
to
which
was
slippery
with
the
contents
of
the
kids
and
heaving
under
us
as
if
there
were
a
volcano
in
the
hold
while
we
were
yet
sliding
in
uproarious
windows
of
the
deck
opened
and
floods
of
brine
descended
simultaneously
with
a
violent
the
shower
was
hailed
by
the
reckless
tars
with
a
hurricane
of
yells
although
for
an
instant
i
really
imagined
we
were
about
being
swamped
in
the
sea
such
volumes
of
water
came
cascading
down
a
day
or
two
after
we
had
made
sufficient
easting
to
stand
to
the
northward
which
we
did
with
the
wind
astern
thus
fairly
turning
the
corner
without
abating
our
rate
of
progress
though
we
had
seen
no
land
since
leaving
callao
cape
horn
was
said
to
be
somewhere
to
the
west
of
us
and
though
there
was
no
positive
evidence
of
the
fact
the
weather
encountered
might
be
accounted
pretty
good
presumptive
proof
the
land
near
cape
horn
however
is
well
worth
seeing
especially
staten
land
upon
one
occasion
the
ship
in
which
i
then
happened
to
be
sailing
drew
near
this
place
from
the
northward
with
a
fair
free
wind
blowing
steadily
through
a
bright
translucent
clay
whose
air
was
almost
musical
with
the
clear
glittering
cold
on
our
starboard
beam
like
a
pile
of
glaciers
in
switzerland
lay
this
staten
land
gleaming
in
barrenness
and
solitude
unnumbered
white
albatross
were
skimming
the
sea
near
by
and
clouds
of
smaller
white
wings
fell
through
the
air
like
high
towering
in
their
own
turbaned
snows
the
pinnacles
loomed
up
like
the
border
of
some
other
world
flashing
walls
and
crystal
battlements
like
the
diamond
along
furthest
frontier
after
leaving
the
latitude
of
the
cape
we
had
several
storms
of
snow
one
night
a
considerable
quantity
laid
upon
the
decks
and
some
of
the
sailors
enjoyed
the
juvenile
diversion
of
woe
unto
the
who
that
night
went
forward
of
the
booms
such
a
target
for
the
throwers
could
never
be
known
by
some
curious
sleight
in
hurling
the
missiles
they
seemed
to
be
thrown
on
board
by
some
hoydenish
outside
the
frigate
at
daybreak
midshipman
pert
went
below
to
the
surgeon
with
an
alarming
wound
gallantly
received
in
discharging
his
perilous
duty
on
the
forecastle
the
officer
of
the
deck
had
sent
him
on
an
errand
to
tell
the
boatswain
that
he
was
wanted
in
the
cabin
while
in
the
very
act
of
performing
the
exploit
of
delivering
the
message
pert
was
struck
on
the
nose
with
a
of
wondrous
compactness
upon
being
informed
of
the
disaster
the
rogues
expressed
the
liveliest
sympathy
pert
was
no
favourite
after
one
of
these
storms
it
was
a
curious
sight
to
see
the
men
relieving
the
uppermost
deck
of
its
load
of
snow
it
became
the
duty
of
the
captain
of
each
gun
to
keep
his
own
station
clean
accordingly
with
an
old
broom
or
he
proceeded
to
business
often
quarrelling
with
his
neighbours
about
their
scraping
their
snow
on
his
premises
it
was
like
broadway
in
winter
the
morning
after
a
storm
when
rival
are
at
work
cleaning
the
sidewalk
now
and
then
by
way
of
variety
we
had
a
fall
of
hailstones
so
big
that
sometimes
we
found
ourselves
dodging
them
the
commodore
had
a
polynesian
servant
on
board
whose
services
he
had
engaged
at
the
society
islands
unlike
his
countrymen
wooloo
was
of
a
sedate
earnest
and
philosophic
temperament
having
never
been
outside
of
the
tropics
before
he
found
many
phenomena
off
cape
horn
which
absorbed
his
attention
and
set
him
like
other
philosophers
to
feign
theories
corresponding
to
the
marvels
he
beheld
at
the
first
snow
when
he
saw
the
deck
covered
all
over
with
a
white
powder
as
it
were
he
expanded
his
eyes
into
stewpans
but
upon
examining
the
strange
substance
he
decided
that
this
must
be
a
species
of
flower
such
as
was
compounded
into
his
and
other
dainties
in
vain
did
an
experienced
natural
philosopher
belonging
to
the
maintain
before
his
face
that
in
this
hypothesis
wooloo
was
mistaken
opinion
remained
unchanged
for
some
time
as
for
the
hailstones
they
transported
him
he
went
about
with
a
bucket
making
collections
and
receiving
contributions
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
them
home
to
his
sweethearts
for
glass
beads
but
having
put
his
bucket
away
and
returning
to
it
again
and
finding
nothing
but
a
little
water
he
accused
the
of
stealing
his
precious
stones
this
suggests
another
story
concerning
him
the
first
time
he
was
given
a
piece
of
to
eat
he
was
observed
to
pick
out
very
carefully
every
raisin
and
throw
it
away
with
a
gesture
indicative
of
the
highest
disgust
it
turned
out
that
he
had
taken
the
raisins
for
bugs
in
our
this
wandering
about
the
in
his
barbaric
robe
seemed
a
being
from
some
other
sphere
his
tastes
were
our
abominations
ours
his
our
creed
he
rejected
his
we
we
thought
him
a
loon
he
fancied
us
fools
had
the
case
been
reversed
had
we
been
polynesians
and
he
an
american
our
mutual
opinion
of
each
other
would
still
have
remained
the
same
a
fact
proving
that
neither
was
wrong
but
both
right
chapter
xxix
the
though
leaving
the
cape
behind
us
the
severe
cold
still
continued
and
one
of
its
worst
consequences
was
the
almost
incurable
drowsiness
induced
thereby
during
the
long
all
along
the
decks
huddled
between
the
guns
stretched
out
on
the
carronade
slides
and
in
every
accessible
nook
and
corner
you
would
see
the
sailors
wrapped
in
their
monkey
jackets
in
a
state
of
torpidity
lying
still
and
freezing
alive
without
the
power
to
rise
and
shake
themselves
you
lazy
dogs
our
third
lieutenant
a
virginian
would
cry
rapping
them
with
his
speaking
trumpet
up
and
stir
but
in
vain
they
would
rise
for
an
instant
and
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
down
they
would
drop
as
if
shot
through
the
heart
often
i
have
lain
thus
when
the
fact
that
if
i
laid
much
longer
i
would
actually
freeze
to
death
would
come
over
me
with
such
overpowering
force
as
to
break
the
icy
spell
and
starting
to
my
feet
i
would
endeavour
to
go
through
the
combined
manual
and
pedal
exercise
to
restore
the
circulation
the
first
fling
of
my
benumbed
arm
generally
struck
me
in
the
face
instead
of
smiting
my
chest
its
true
destination
but
in
these
cases
muscles
have
their
own
way
in
exercising
my
other
extremities
i
was
obliged
to
hold
on
to
something
and
leap
with
both
feet
for
my
limbs
seemed
as
destitute
of
joints
as
a
pair
of
canvas
pants
spread
to
dry
and
frozen
stiff
when
an
order
was
given
to
haul
the
required
the
strength
of
the
entire
watch
some
two
hundred
spectator
would
have
supposed
that
all
hands
had
received
a
stroke
of
the
palsy
roused
from
their
state
of
enchantment
they
came
halting
and
limping
across
the
decks
falling
against
each
other
and
for
a
few
moments
almost
unable
to
handle
the
ropes
the
slightest
exertion
seemed
intolerable
and
frequently
a
body
of
eighty
or
a
hundred
men
summoned
to
brace
the
would
hang
over
the
rope
for
several
minutes
waiting
for
some
active
fellow
to
pick
it
up
and
put
it
into
their
hands
even
then
it
was
some
time
before
they
were
able
to
do
anything
they
made
all
the
motions
usual
in
hauling
a
rope
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
yard
budged
an
inch
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
the
officers
swore
at
them
or
sent
the
midshipmen
among
them
to
find
out
who
those
and
were
the
sailors
were
so
enveloped
in
monkey
jackets
that
in
the
dark
night
there
was
no
telling
one
from
the
other
sir
cries
little
pert
eagerly
catching
hold
of
the
skirts
of
an
old
and
trying
to
turn
him
round
so
as
to
peer
under
his
tarpaulin
are
sir
your
name
out
was
the
impertinent
rejoinder
you
you
old
rascal
have
you
licked
for
that
tell
me
his
name
some
of
you
turning
round
to
the
bystanders
cries
a
voice
at
a
distance
me
but
i
know
sir
and
at
you
and
so
saying
pert
drops
the
impenetrable
unknown
and
makes
into
the
crowd
after
the
bodiless
voice
but
the
attempt
to
find
an
owner
for
that
voice
is
quite
as
idle
as
the
effort
to
discover
the
contents
of
the
monkey
jacket
and
here
sorrowful
mention
must
be
made
of
something
which
during
this
state
of
affairs
most
sorely
afflicted
me
most
monkey
jackets
are
of
a
dark
hue
mine
as
i
have
fifty
times
repeated
and
say
again
was
white
and
thus
in
those
long
dark
nights
when
it
was
my
on
deck
and
not
in
the
top
and
others
went
skulking
and
about
the
decks
secure
from
identity
own
hapless
jacket
for
ever
proclaimed
the
name
of
its
wearer
it
gave
me
many
a
hard
job
which
otherwise
i
should
have
escaped
when
an
officer
wanted
a
man
for
any
particular
aloft
say
to
communicate
some
slight
order
to
the
captains
of
the
easy
in
that
mob
of
incognitoes
to
individualise
white
and
dispatch
him
on
the
errand
then
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
hang
back
when
the
ropes
were
being
pulled
indeed
upon
all
these
occasions
such
alacrity
and
cheerfulness
was
i
obliged
to
display
that
i
was
frequently
held
up
as
an
illustrious
example
of
activity
which
the
rest
were
called
upon
to
emulate
you
lazy
lubbers
look
at
there
pull
like
him
oh
how
i
execrated
my
luckless
garment
how
often
i
scoured
the
deck
with
it
to
give
it
a
tawny
hue
how
often
i
supplicated
the
inexorable
brush
captain
of
the
for
just
one
brushful
of
his
invaluable
pigment
frequently
i
meditated
giving
it
a
toss
overboard
but
i
had
not
the
resolution
jacketless
at
sea
jacketless
so
near
cape
horn
the
thought
was
unendurable
and
at
least
my
garment
was
a
jacket
in
name
if
not
in
utility
at
length
i
essayed
a
bob
said
i
assuming
all
possible
suavity
and
accosting
a
with
a
sort
of
diplomatic
assumption
of
superiority
i
was
ready
to
part
with
this
of
mine
and
take
yours
in
would
you
give
me
to
boot
you
to
he
exclaimed
with
horror
take
your
infernal
jacket
for
a
gift
how
i
hailed
every
for
on
them
of
the
men
became
along
with
myself
and
powdered
with
the
flakes
we
all
looked
like
millers
we
had
six
lieutenants
all
of
whom
with
the
exception
of
the
first
lieutenant
by
turns
headed
the
watches
three
of
these
officers
including
mad
jack
were
strict
disciplinarians
and
never
permitted
us
to
lay
down
on
deck
during
the
night
and
to
tell
the
truth
though
it
caused
much
growling
it
was
far
better
for
our
health
to
be
thus
kept
on
our
feet
so
promenading
was
all
the
vogue
for
some
of
us
however
it
was
like
pacing
in
a
dungeon
for
as
we
had
to
keep
at
our
at
the
halyards
some
at
the
braces
and
were
not
allowed
to
stroll
about
indefinitely
and
fairly
take
the
measure
of
the
entire
keel
we
were
fain
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
space
of
a
very
few
feet

the
worse
of
this
was
soon
over
the
suddenness
of
the
change
in
the
temperature
consequent
on
leaving
cape
horn
and
steering
to
the
northward
with
a
breeze
is
a
noteworthy
thing
you
are
assailed
by
a
blast

seems
to
have
edged
itself
on
icebergs
but
in
a
little
more
than
a
week
your
jacket
may
be

one
word
more
about
cape

we

done
with
it
years

taking
his

in

it
will
be

almost
incredible
that
for
so

vessels

by

a
peep
through
a
at
the
subterranean
parts
of
a
while
now
running
rapidly
away
from
the
bitter
coast
of
patagonia
battling
with
the
best
we
may
come
under
the
lee
of
my
reader
while
i
tell
of
the
less
painful
sights
to
be
seen
in
a
frigate
a
hint
has
already
been
conveyed
concerning
the
subterranean
depths
of
the
hold
but
there
is
no
time
here
to
speak
of
the
a
cellar
down
in
the
where
the
is
kept
nor
of
the
where
the
great
hawsers
and
chains
are
piled
as
you
see
them
at
a
large
on
shore
nor
of
the
vaults
where
tierces
of
sugar
molasses
vinegar
rice
and
flour
are
snugly
stowed
nor
of
the
full
as
a
loft
up
with
great
and
all
in
their
places
like
so
many
white
vests
in
a
wardrobe
nor
of
the
copper
and
closely
packed
with
kegs
of
powder
and
cartridges
nor
of
the
immense
or
subterranean
arsenals
full
as
a
bushel
of
apples
with
balls
nor
of
the
a
large
apartment
tinned
all
round
within
to
keep
out
the
mice
where
the
hard
biscuit
destined
for
the
consumption
of
five
hundred
men
on
a
long
voyage
is
stowed
away
by
the
cubic
yard
nor
of
the
vast
iron
tanks
for
fresh
water
in
the
hold
like
the
reservoir
lakes
at
fairmount
in
philadelphia
nor
of
the
where
the
kegs
of
and
casks
of
linseed
oil
and
all
sorts
of
pots
and
brushes
are
kept
nor
of
the
where
the
forges
and
anvils
may
be
heard
ringing
at
times
i
say
i
have
no
time
to
speak
of
these
things
and
many
more
places
of
note
but
there
is
one
very
extensive
warehouse
among
the
rest
that
needs
special
in
the
neversink
it
was
down
in
the
basement
beneath
the
and
you
went
to
it
by
way
of
the
a
very
dim
devious
corridor
indeed
at
find
yourself
in
a
gloomy
apartment
lit
by
a
solitary
lamp
on
one
side
are
shelves
filled
with
balls
of
and
numerous
twines
of
assorted
sizes
in
another
direction
you
see
large
cases
containing
heaps
of
articles
reminding
one
of
a
fids
and
iron
and
in
a
third
quarter
you
see
a
sort
of
hardware
piled
with
all
manner
of
hooks
bolts
nails
screws
and
and
in
still
another
direction
you
see
a
store
heaped
up
with
sheeves
and
wheels
through
low
arches
in
the
bulkhead
beyond
you
peep
in
upon
distant
vaults
and
catacombs
obscurely
lighted
in
the
far
end
and
showing
immense
coils
of
new
ropes
and
other
bulky
articles
stowed
in
tiers
all
savouring
of
tar
but
by
far
the
most
curious
department
of
these
mysterious
is
the
armoury
where
the
spikes
cutlasses
pistols
and
belts
forming
the
arms
of
the
boarders
in
time
of
action
are
hung
against
the
walls
and
suspended
in
thick
rows
from
the
beams
overhead
here
too
are
to
be
seen
scores
of
patent
revolvers
which
though
furnished
with
but
one
tube
multiply
the
fatal
bullets
as
the
naval
with
a
cannibal
cruelty
in
one
blow
nine
times
multiplies
a
lashes
so
that
when
a
sailor
is
ordered
one
dozen
lashes
the
sentence
should
read
one
hundred
and
eight
all
these
arms
are
kept
in
the
brightest
order
wearing
a
fine
polish
and
may
truly
be
said
to
credit
on
the
yeoman
and
his
mates
among
the
lower
grade
of
officers
in
a
that
of
yeoman
is
not
the
least
important
his
responsibilities
are
denoted
by
his
pay
while
the
captains
of
the
tops
and
others
receive
but
fifteen
and
eighteen
dollars
a
little
more
than
a
mere
able
yeoman
in
an
american
ship
receives
forty
dollars
and
in
a
frigate
dollars
per
month
he
is
accountable
for
all
the
articles
under
his
charge
and
on
no
account
must
deliver
a
yard
of
twine
or
a
nail
to
the
boatswain
or
carpenter
unless
shown
a
written
requisition
and
order
from
the
senior
lieutenant
the
yeoman
is
to
be
found
burrowing
in
his
underground
all
the
day
long
in
readiness
to
serve
licensed
customers
but
in
the
counter
behind
which
he
usually
stands
there
is
no
place
for
a
till
to
drop
the
shillings
in
which
takes
away
not
a
little
from
the
most
agreeable
part
of
a
duties
nor
among
the
musty
old
in
his
desk
where
he
registers
all
expenditures
of
his
stuffs
is
there
any
cash
or
check
book
the
yeoman
of
the
neversink
was
a
somewhat
odd
specimen
of
a
troglodyte
he
was
a
little
old
man
with
great
looking
through
portentous
round
spectacles
which
he
called
his
he
was
imbued
with
a
wonderful
zeal
for
the
naval
service
and
seemed
to
think
that
in
keeping
his
pistols
and
cutlasses
free
from
rust
he
preserved
the
national
honour
untarnished
after
it
was
amusing
to
watch
his
anxious
air
as
the
various
restored
to
him
the
arms
used
at
the
martial
exercises
of
the
crew
as
successive
bundles
would
be
deposited
on
his
counter
he
would
count
over
the
pistols
and
cutlasses
like
an
old
housekeeper
telling
over
her
silver
forks
and
spoons
in
a
pantry
before
retiring
for
the
night
and
often
with
a
sort
of
dark
lantern
in
his
hand
he
might
be
seen
poking
into
his
furthest
vaults
and
cellars
and
counting
over
his
great
coils
of
ropes
as
if
they
were
all
jolly
puncheons
of
old
port
and
madeira
by
reason
of
his
incessant
watchfulness
and
unaccountable
bachelor
oddities
it
was
very
difficult
for
him
to
retain
in
his
employment
the
various
sailors
who
from
time
to
time
were
billeted
with
him
to
do
the
duty
of
subalterns
in
particular
he
was
always
desirous
of
having
at
least
one
steady
faultless
young
man
of
a
literary
taste
to
keep
an
eye
to
his
and
swab
out
the
armoury
every
morning
it
was
an
odious
business
this
to
be
immured
all
day
in
such
a
bottomless
hole
among
tarry
old
ropes
and
villainous
guns
and
pistols
it
was
with
peculiar
dread
that
i
one
day
noticed
the
of
as
they
called
him
fastened
upon
me
with
a
fatal
glance
of
and
approbation
he
had
somehow
heard
of
my
being
a
very
learned
person
who
could
both
read
and
write
with
extraordinary
facility
and
moreover
that
i
was
a
rather
reserved
youth
who
kept
his
modest
unassuming
merits
in
the
background
but
though
from
the
keen
sense
of
my
situation
as
a
all
this
about
my
keeping
myself
in
the
ground
was
true
enough
yet
i
had
no
idea
of
hiding
my
diffident
merits
ground
i
became
alarmed
at
the
old
goggling
glances
lest
he
should
drag
me
down
into
tarry
perdition
in
his
hideous
but
this
fate
was
providentially
averted
owing
to
mysterious
causes
which
i
never
could
fathom
chapter
xxxi
the
gunner
under
hatches
among
such
a
crowd
of
marked
characters
as
were
to
be
met
with
on
board
our
frigate
many
of
whom
moved
in
mysterious
circles
beneath
the
lowermost
deck
and
at
long
intervals
flitted
into
sight
like
apparitions
and
disappeared
again
for
whole
weeks
together
there
were
some
who
inordinately
excited
my
curiosity
and
whose
names
callings
and
precise
abodes
i
industriously
sought
out
in
order
to
learn
something
satisfactory
concerning
them
while
engaged
in
these
inquiries
often
fruitless
or
but
partially
gratified
i
could
not
but
regret
that
there
was
no
public
printed
directory
for
the
neversink
such
as
they
have
in
large
towns
containing
an
alphabetic
list
of
all
the
crew
and
where
they
might
be
found
also
in
losing
myself
in
some
remote
dark
corner
of
the
bowels
of
the
frigate
in
the
vicinity
of
the
various
shops
and
warehouses
i
much
lamented
that
no
enterprising
tar
had
yet
thought
of
compiling
a
of
the
so
that
the
tourist
might
have
a
reliable
guide
indeed
there
were
several
parts
of
the
ship
under
hatches
shrouded
in
mystery
and
completely
inaccessible
to
the
sailor
wondrous
old
doors
barred
and
bolted
in
dingy
bulkheads
must
have
opened
into
regions
full
of
interest
to
a
successful
explorer
they
looked
like
the
gloomy
entrances
to
family
vaults
of
buried
dead
and
when
i
chanced
to
see
some
unknown
functionary
insert
his
key
and
enter
these
inexplicable
apartments
with
a
as
if
on
solemn
official
business
i
almost
quaked
to
dive
in
with
him
and
satisfy
myself
whether
these
vaults
indeed
contained
the
mouldering
relics
of
old
commodores
and
but
the
habitations
of
the
living
commodore
and
spacious
and
curtained
themselves
almost
as
sealed
volumes
and
i
passed
them
in
hopeless
wonderment
like
a
peasant
before
a
palace
night
and
day
armed
sentries
guarded
their
sacred
portals
cutlass
in
hand
and
had
i
dared
to
cross
their
path
i
would
infallibly
have
been
cut
down
as
if
in
battle
thus
though
for
a
period
of
more
than
a
year
i
was
an
inmate
of
this
floating
box
of
yet
there
were
numberless
things
in
it
that
to
the
last
remained
wrapped
in
obscurity
or
concerning
which
i
could
only
lose
myself
in
vague
speculations
i
was
as
a
roman
jew
of
the
middle
ages
confined
to
the
quarter
of
the
town
and
forbidden
to
stray
beyond
my
limits
or
i
was
as
a
modern
traveller
in
the
same
famous
city
forced
to
quit
it
at
last
without
gaining
ingress
to
the
most
mysterious
innermost
shrine
of
the
pope
and
the
dungeons
and
cells
of
the
inquisition
but
among
all
the
persons
and
things
on
board
that
puzzled
me
and
filled
me
most
with
strange
emotions
of
doubt
misgivings
and
mystery
was
the
short
square
grim
man
his
hair
and
beard
grizzled
and
singed
as
if
with
gunpowder
his
skin
was
of
a
flecky
brown
like
the
stained
barrel
of
a
and
his
hollow
eyes
burned
in
his
head
like
he
it
was
who
had
access
to
many
of
those
mysterious
vaults
i
have
spoken
of
often
he
might
be
seen
groping
his
way
into
them
followed
by
his
subalterns
the
old
as
if
intent
upon
laying
a
train
of
powder
to
blow
up
the
ship
i
remembered
guy
fawkes
and
the
and
made
earnest
inquiry
whether
this
gunner
was
a
roman
catholic
i
felt
relieved
when
informed
that
he
was
not
a
little
circumstance
which
one
of
his
once
told
me
heightened
the
gloomy
interest
with
which
i
regarded
his
chief
he
told
me
that
at
periodical
intervals
his
master
the
gunner
accompanied
by
his
phalanx
entered
into
the
great
magazine
under
the
of
which
he
had
sole
custody
and
kept
the
key
nearly
as
big
as
the
key
of
the
bastile
and
provided
with
lanterns
something
like
sir
humphrey
for
coal
mines
proceeded
to
turn
end
for
end
all
the
kegs
of
powder
and
packages
of
cartridges
stored
in
this
innermost
explosive
vault
lined
throughout
with
sheets
of
copper
in
the
vestibule
of
the
magazine
against
the
panelling
were
several
pegs
for
slippers
and
before
penetrating
further
than
that
vestibule
every
man
of
the
gang
silently
removed
his
shoes
for
fear
that
the
nails
in
their
heels
might
possibly
create
a
spark
by
striking
against
the
coppered
floor
within
then
with
slippered
feet
and
with
hushed
whispers
they
stole
into
the
heart
of
the
place
this
turning
of
the
powder
was
to
preserve
its
inflammability
and
surely
it
was
a
business
full
of
direful
interest
to
be
buried
so
deep
below
the
sun
handling
whole
barrels
of
powder
any
one
of
which
touched
by
the
smallest
spark
was
powerful
enough
to
blow
up
a
whole
street
of
warehouses
the
gunner
went
by
the
name
of
though
i
thought
this
an
undignified
name
for
so
momentous
a
personage
who
had
all
our
lives
in
his
hand
while
we
lay
in
callao
we
received
from
shore
several
barrels
of
powder
so
soon
as
the
came
alongside
with
them
orders
were
given
to
extinguish
all
lights
and
all
fires
in
the
ship
and
the
and
his
corporals
inspected
every
deck
to
see
that
this
order
was
obeyed
a
very
prudent
precaution
no
doubt
but
not
observed
at
all
in
the
turkish
navy
the
turkish
sailors
will
sit
on
their
tranquilly
smoking
while
kegs
of
powder
are
being
rolled
under
their
ignited
this
shows
the
great
comfort
there
is
in
the
doctrine
of
these
fatalists
and
how
such
a
doctrine
in
some
things
at
least
relieves
men
from
nervous
anxieties
but
we
all
are
fatalists
at
bottom
nor
need
we
so
much
marvel
at
the
heroism
of
that
army
officer
who
challenged
his
personal
foe
to
bestride
a
barrel
of
powder
with
match
to
be
placed
between
be
blown
up
in
good
company
for
it
is
pretty
certain
that
the
whole
earth
itself
is
a
vast
hogshead
full
of
inflammable
materials
and
which
we
are
always
bestriding
at
the
same
time
that
all
good
christians
believe
that
at
any
minute
the
last
day
may
come
and
the
terrible
combustion
of
the
entire
planet
ensue
as
if
impressed
with
a
befitting
sense
of
the
awfulness
of
his
calling
our
gunner
always
wore
a
fixed
expression
of
solemnity
which
was
heightened
by
his
grizzled
hair
and
beard
but
what
imparted
such
a
sinister
look
to
him
and
what
wrought
so
upon
my
imagination
concerning
this
man
was
a
frightful
scar
crossing
his
left
cheek
and
forehead
he
had
been
almost
mortally
wounded
they
said
with
a
during
a
frigate
engagement
in
the
last
war
with
britain
he
was
the
most
methodical
exact
and
punctual
of
all
the
forward
officers
among
his
other
duties
it
pertained
to
him
while
in
harbour
to
see
that
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
evening
one
of
the
great
guns
was
discharged
from
the
forecastle
a
ceremony
only
observed
in
a
and
always
at
the
precise
moment
you
might
behold
him
blowing
his
match
then
applying
it
and
with
that
booming
thunder
in
his
ear
and
the
smell
of
the
powder
in
his
hair
he
retired
to
his
hammock
for
the
night
what
dreams
he
must
have
had
the
same

sent
bowling

compel
them
to
stop
their

it
was
enough
to
make
you
a
man
of
method
for
life
to
see
the
gunner
superintending
his
subalterns
when
preparing
the
batteries
for
a
great
national
salute
while
lying
in
harbour
intelligence
reached
us
of
the
lamentable
casualty
that
befell
certain
high
officers
of
state
including
the
acting
secretary
of
the
navy
himself
some
other
member
of
the
cabinet
a
commodore
and
others
all
engaged
in
experimenting
upon
a
engine
of
war
at
the
same
time
with
the
receipt
of
this
sad
news
orders
arrived
to
fire
for
the
deceased
head
of
the
naval
department
upon
this
occasion
the
gunner
was
more
than
usually
ceremonious
in
seeing
that
the
long
were
thoroughly
loaded
and
rammed
down
and
then
accurately
marked
with
chalk
so
as
to
be
discharged
in
undeviating
rotation
first
from
the
larboard
side
and
then
from
the
starboard
but
as
my
ears
hummed
and
all
my
bones
danced
in
me
with
the
reverberating
din
and
my
eyes
and
nostrils
were
almost
suffocated
with
the
smoke
and
when
i
saw
this
grim
old
gunner
firing
away
so
solemnly
i
thought
it
a
strange
mode
of
honouring
a
memory
who
had
himself
been
slaughtered
by
a
cannon
only
the
smoke
that
after
rolling
in
at
the
rapidly
drifted
away
to
leeward
and
was
lost
to
view
seemed
truly
emblematical
touching
the
personage
thus
honoured

that

a
vapour

a
flogging
if
you
begin
the
day
with
a
laugh
you
may
nevertheless
end
it
with
a
sob
and
a
sigh
among
the
many
who
were
exceedingly
diverted
with
the
scene
between
the
down
easter
and
the
lieutenant
none
laughed
more
heartily
than
john
peter
mark
and
sailors
of
the
the
same
evening
these
four
found
themselves
prisoners
in
the
with
a
sentry
standing
over
them
they
were
charged
with
violating
a
law
of
the
been
engaged
in
one
of
those
tangled
general
fights
sometimes
occurring
among
sailors
they
had
nothing
to
anticipate
but
a
flogging
at
the
pleasure
toward
evening
of
the
next
day
they
were
startled
by
the
dread
summons
of
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
at
the
principal
summons
that
ever
sends
a
shudder
through
every
manly
heart
in
a
frigate
hands
witness
punishment
ahoy
the
hoarseness
of
the
cry
its
unrelenting
prolongation
its
being
caught
up
at
different
points
and
sent
through
the
lowermost
depths
of
the
ship
all
this
produces
a
most
dismal
effect
upon
every
heart
not
calloused
by
long
habituation
to
it
however
much
you
may
desire
to
absent
yourself
from
the
scene
that
ensues
yet
behold
it
you
must
or
at
least
stand
near
it
you
must
for
the
regulations
enjoin
the
attendance
of
the
entire
company
from
the
corpulent
captain
himself
to
the
smallest
boy
who
strikes
the
bell
hands
witness
punishment
ahoy
to
the
sensitive
seaman
that
summons
sounds
like
a
doom
he
knows
that
the
same
law
which
impels
same
law
by
which
the
culprits
of
the
day
must
suffer
that
by
that
very
law
he
also
is
liable
at
any
time
to
be
judged
and
condemned
and
the
inevitableness
of
his
own
presence
at
the
scene
the
strong
arm
that
drags
him
in
view
of
the
scourge
and
holds
him
there
till
all
is
over
forcing
upon
his
loathing
eye
and
soul
the
sufferings
and
groans
of
men
who
have
familiarly
consorted
with
him
eaten
with
him
battled
out
watches
with
of
his
own
type
and
this
conveys
a
terrible
hint
of
the
omnipotent
authority
under
which
he
lives
indeed
to
such
a
man
the
naval
summons
to
witness
punishment
carries
a
thrill
somewhat
akin
to
what
we
may
impute
to
the
quick
and
the
dead
when
they
shall
hear
the
last
trump
that
is
to
bid
them
all
arise
in
their
ranks
and
behold
the
final
penalties
inflicted
upon
the
sinners
of
our
race
but
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
to
all
this
summons
conveys
such
poignant
emotions
but
it
is
hard
to
decide
whether
one
should
be
glad
or
sad
that
this
is
not
the
case
whether
it
is
grateful
to
know
that
so
much
pain
is
avoided
or
whether
it
is
far
sadder
to
think
that
either
from
constitutional
or
the
multiplied
searings
of
habit
hundreds
of
have
been
made
proof
against
the
sense
of
degradation
pity
and
shame
as
if
in
sympathy
with
the
scene
to
be
enacted
the
sun
which
the
day
previous
had
merrily
flashed
upon
the
tin
pan
of
the
disconsolate
down
easter
was
now
setting
over
the
dreary
waters
veiling
itself
in
vapours
the
wind
blew
hoarsely
in
the
cordage
the
seas
broke
heavily
against
the
bows
and
the
frigate
staggering
under
whole
strained
as
in
agony
on
her
way
hands
witness
punishment
ahoy
at
the
summons
the
crew
crowded
round
the
multitudes
eager
to
obtain
a
good
place
on
the
booms
to
overlook
the
scene
many
laughing
and
chatting
others
canvassing
the
case
of
the
culprits
some
maintaining
sad
anxious
countenances
or
carrying
a
suppressed
indignation
in
their
eyes
a
few
purposely
keeping
behind
to
avoid
looking
on
in
short
among
five
hundred
men
there
was
every
possible
shade
of
character
all
the
together
in
a
group
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
the
first
lieutenant
in
advance
and
the
surgeon
whose
special
duty
it
is
to
be
present
at
such
times
standing
close
by
his
side
presently
the
captain
came
forward
from
his
cabin
and
stood
in
the
centre
of
this
solemn
group
with
a
small
paper
in
his
hand
that
paper
was
the
daily
report
of
offences
regularly
laid
upon
his
table
every
morning
or
evening
like
the
journal
placed
by
a
napkin
at
breakfast
bring
up
the
prisoners
he
said
a
few
moments
elapsed
during
which
the
captain
now
clothed
in
his
most
dreadful
attributes
fixed
his
eyes
severely
upon
the
crew
when
suddenly
a
lane
formed
through
the
crowd
of
seamen
and
the
prisoners
rattan
in
hand
on
one
side
and
an
armed
marine
on
the
took
up
their
stations
at
the
mast

to
say

two
steady
men
whom
i
had
often
admired
for
their
sobriety
replied
that
they
did
not
strike
the
first
blow
that
they
had
submitted
to
much
before
they
had
yielded
to
their
passions
but
as
they
acknowledged
that
they
had
at
last
defended
themselves
their
excuse
was
overruled
brutal
bully
who
it
seems
was
the
real
author
of
the
about
entering
into
a
long
extenuation
when
he
was
cut
short
by
being
made
to
confess
irrespective
of
circumstances
that
he
had
been
in
the
fray
peter
a
handsome
lad
about
nineteen
years
old
belonging
to
the
looked
pale
and
tremulous
he
was
a
great
favourite
in
his
part
of
the
ship
and
especially
in
his
own
mess
principally
composed
of
lads
of
his
own
age
that
morning
two
of
his
young
had
gone
to
his
bag
taken
out
his
best
clothes
and
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
marine
sentry
at
the
had
handed
them
to
him
to
be
put
on
against
being
summoned
to
the
mast
this
was
done
to
propitiate
the
captain
as
most
captains
love
to
see
a
tidy
sailor
but
it
would
not
do
to
all
his
supplications
the
captain
turned
a
deaf
ear
peter
declared
that
he
had
been
struck
twice
before
he
had
returned
a
blow
matter
said
the
captain
struck
at
last
instead
of
reporting
the
case
to
an
officer
i
allow
no
man
to
fight
on
board
here
but
myself
i
do
the
men

added
all

know
the
penalty
strip
are
the
gratings
rigged
the
gratings
are
square
frames
of
barred
sometimes
placed
over
the
hatchways
one
of
these
squares
was
now
laid
on
the
deck
close
to
the
bulwarks
and
while
the
remaining
preparations
were
being
made
the
assisted
the
prisoners
in
removing
their
jackets
and
shirts
this
done
their
shirts
were
loosely
thrown
over
their
shoulders
at
a
sign
from
the
captain
john
with
a
shameless
leer
advanced
and
stood
passively
upon
the
grating
while
the
old
with
grey
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
bound
his
feet
to
the
and
stretching
out
his
arms
over
his
head
secured
them
to
the
above
he
then
retreated
a
little
space
standing
silent
meanwhile
the
boatswain
stood
solemnly
on
the
other
side
with
a
green
bag
in
his
hand
from
which
taking
four
instruments
of
punishment
he
gave
one
to
each
of
his
mates
for
a
fresh

by
a
fresh
hand
is
the
ceremonious
privilege
accorded
to
every
culprit
at
another
sign
from
the
captain
the
stepping
up
removed
the
shirt
from
the
prisoner
at
this
juncture
a
wave
broke
against
the
side
and
clashed
the
spray
over
his
exposed
back
but
though
the
air
was
piercing
cold
and
the
water
drenched
him
john
stood
still
without
a
shudder
the
finger
was
now
lifted
and
the
first
advanced
combing
out
the
nine
tails
of
his
with
his
hand
and
then
sweeping
them
round
his
neck
brought
them
with
the
whole
force
of
his
body
upon
the
mark
again
and
again
and
again
and
at
every
blow
higher
and
higher
rose
the
long
purple
bars
on
the
back
but
he
only
bowed
over
his
head
and
stood
still
meantime
some
of
the
crew
whispered
among
themselves
in
applause
of
their
nerve
but
the
greater
part
were
breathlessly
silent
as
the
keen
scourge
hissed
through
the
wintry
air
and
fell
with
a
cutting
wiry
sound
upon
the
mark
one
dozen
lashes
being
applied
the
man
was
taken
down
and
went
among
the
crew
with
a
smile
saying
me
nothing
when
used
to
it
who
wants
to
fight
the
next
was
antone
the
portuguese
at
every
blow
he
surged
from
side
to
side
pouring
out
a
torrent
of
involuntary
blasphemies
never
before
had
he
been
heard
to
curse
when
cut
down
he
went
among
the
men
swearing
to
have
the
life
of
the
captain
of
course
this
was
unheard
by
the
officers
mark
the
third
prisoner
only
cringed
and
coughed
under
his
punishment
he
had
some
pulmonary
complaint
he
was
off
duty
for
several
days
after
the
flogging
but
this
was
partly
to
be
imputed
to
his
extreme
mental
misery
it
was
his
first
scourging
and
he
felt
the
insult
more
than
the
injury
he
became
silent
and
sullen
for
the
rest
of
the
cruise
the
fourth
and
last
was
peter
the
lad
he
had
often
boasted
that
he
had
never
been
degraded
at
the
gangway
the
day
before
his
cheek
had
worn
its
usual
red
but
now
no
ghost
was
whiter
as
he
was
being
secured
to
the
gratings
and
the
shudderings
and
creepings
of
his
dazzlingly
white
back
were
revealed
he
turned
round
his
head
imploringly
but
his
weeping
entreaties
and
vows
of
contrition
were
of
no
avail
would
not
forgive
god
almighty
cried
the
captain
the
fourth
advanced
and
at
the
first
blow
the
boy
shouting
god
oh
my
god
writhed
and
leaped
so
as
to
displace
the
gratings
and
scatter
the
nine
tails
of
the
scourge
all
over
his
person
at
the
next
blow
he
howled
leaped
and
raged
in
unendurable
torture
are
you
stopping
for
cried
the
captain
on
and
the
whole
dozen
was
applied
care
what
happens
to
me
now
wept
peter
going
among
the
crew
with
eyes
as
he
put
on
his
shirt
have
been
flogged
once
and
they
may
do
it
again
if
they
will
let
them
look
for
me
now
down
cried
the
captain
and
the
crew
slowly
dispersed
let
us
have
the
charity
to
believe
we
some
captains
in
the
navy
say
that
the
thing
of
all
others
most
repulsive
to
them
in
the
routine
of
what
they
consider
their
duty
is
the
administration
of
corporal
punishment
upon
the
crew
for
surely
not
to
feel
scarified
to
the
quick
at
these
scenes
would
argue
a
man
but
a
beast
you
see
a
human
being
stripped
like
a
slave
scourged
worse
than
a
hound
and
for
what
for
things
not
essentially
criminal
but
only
made
so
by
arbitrary
laws
chapter
xxxiv
some
of
the
evil
effects
of
flogging
there
are
incidental
considerations
touching
this
matter
of
flogging
which
exaggerate
the
evil
into
a
great
enormity
many
illustrations
might
be
given
but
let
us
be
content
with
a
few
one
of
the
arguments
advanced
by
officers
of
the
navy
in
favour
of
corporal
punishment
is
this
it
can
be
inflicted
in
a
moment
it
consumes
no
valuable
time
and
when
the
shirt
is
put
on
is
the
last
of
it
whereas
if
another
punishment
were
substituted
it
would
probably
occasion
a
great
waste
of
time
and
trouble
besides
thereby
begetting
in
the
sailor
an
undue
idea
of
his
importance
absurd
or
worse
than
absurd
as
it
may
appear
all
this
is
true
and
if
you
start
from
the
same
premises
with
these
officers
you
must
admit
that
they
advance
an
irresistible
argument
but
in
accordance
with
this
principle
captains
in
the
navy
to
a
certain
extent
inflict
the
is
ever
at
nearly
all
degrees
of
transgression
in
offences
not
cognisable
by
a
little
if
any
discrimination
is
shown
it
is
of
a
piece
with
the
penal
laws
that
prevailed
in
england
some
sixty
years
ago
when
one
hundred
and
sixty
different
offences
were
declared
by
the
to
be
capital
and
the
who
but
pilfered
a
watch
was
hung
beside
the
murderer
of
a
family
it
is
one
of
the
most
common
punishments
for
very
trivial
offences
in
the
navy
to
a
for
a
day
or
a
week
and
as
most
seamen
so
cling
to
their
the
loss
of
it
is
generally
deemed
by
them
a
very
serious
penalty
you
will
sometimes
hear
them
say
would
rather
have
my
wind
than
grog
but
there
are
some
sober
seamen
that
would
much
rather
draw
the
money
for
it
instead
of
the
grog
itself
as
provided
by
law
but
they
are
too
often
deterred
from
this
by
the
thought
of
receiving
a
scourging
for
some
inconsiderable
offence
as
a
substitute
for
the
stopping
of
their
spirits
this
is
a
most
serious
obstacle
to
the
cause
of
temperance
in
the
navy
but
in
many
cases
even
the
reluctant
drawing
of
his
grog
can
not
exempt
a
prudent
seaman
from
ignominy
for
besides
the
formal
administering
of
the
at
the
gangway
for
petty
offences
he
is
liable
to
the
or
a
bit
of
indiscriminately
stripping
the
any
time
and
in
any
part
of
the
ship
at
the
merest
wink
from
the
captain
by
an
express
order
of
that
officer
most
mates
carry
the
coiled
in
their
hats
in
readiness
to
be
administered
at
a
warning
upon
any
offender
this
was
the
custom
in
the
neversink
and
until
so
recent
a
period
as
the
administration
of
president
polk
when
the
historian
bancroft
secretary
of
the
navy
officially
interposed
it
was
an
almost
universal
thing
for
the
officers
of
the
watch
at
their
own
discretion
to
inflict
chastisement
upon
a
sailor
and
this
too
in
the
face
of
the
ordinance
restricting
the
power
of
flogging
solely
to
captains
and
courts
martial
nor
was
it
a
thing
unknown
for
a
lieutenant
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
passion
perhaps
inflamed
by
brandy
or
smarting
under
the
sense
of
being
disliked
or
hated
by
the
seamen
to
order
a
whole
watch
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
at
dead
of
night
to
undergo
the
indignity
of
the
it
is
believed
that
even
at
the
present
day
there
are
instances
of
commanders
still
violating
the
law
by
delegating
the
power
of
the
colt
to
subordinates
at
all
events
it
is
certain
that
almost
to
a
man
the
lieutenants
in
the
navy
bitterly
rail
against
the
officiousness
of
bancroft
in
so
materially
abridging
their
usurped
functions
by
snatching
the
colt
from
their
hands
at
the
time
they
predicted
that
this
rash
and
most
interference
of
the
secretary
would
end
in
the
breaking
up
of
all
discipline
in
the
navy
but
it
has
not
so
proved
these
officers
predict
that
if
the
be
abolished
the
same
unfulfilled
prediction
would
be
verified
concerning
the
license
with
which
many
captains
violate
the
express
laws
laid
down
by
congress
for
the
government
of
the
navy
a
glaring
instance
may
be
quoted
for
upward
of
forty
years
there
has
been
on
the
american
a
law
prohibiting
a
captain
from
inflicting
on
his
own
authority
more
than
twelve
lashes
at
one
time
if
more
are
to
be
given
the
sentence
must
be
passed
by
a
yet
for
nearly
half
a
century
this
law
has
been
frequently
and
with
almost
perfect
impunity
set
at
naught
though
of
late
through
the
exertions
of
bancroft
and
others
it
has
been
much
better
observed
than
formerly
indeed
at
the
present
day
it
is
generally
respected
still
while
the
neversink
was
lying
in
a
south
american
port
on
the
cruise
now
written
of
the
seamen
belonging
to
another
american
frigate
informed
us
that
their
captain
sometimes
inflicted
upon
his
own
authority
eighteen
and
twenty
lashes
it
is
worth
while
to
state
that
this
frigate
was
vastly
admired
by
the
shore
ladies
for
her
wonderfully
neat
appearance
one
of
her
told
me
that
he
had
used
up
three
charged
to
him
on
the
books
of
the
purser
in
scraping
the
and
the
combings
of
the
hatchways
it
is
singular
that
while
the
lieutenants
of
the
watch
in
american
so
long
usurped
the
power
of
inflicting
corporal
punishment
with
the
few
or
no
similar
abuses
were
known
in
the
english
navy
and
though
the
captain
of
an
english
armed
ship
is
authorised
to
inflict
at
his
own
discretion
than
a
dozen
lashes
i
think
three
dozen
yet
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
upon
the
whole
there
is
as
much
flogging
at
present
in
the
english
navy
as
in
the
american
the
chivalric
virginian
john
randolph
of
roanoke
declared
in
his
place
in
congress
that
on
board
of
the
american
that
carried
him
out
ambassador
to
russia
he
had
witnessed
more
flogging
than
had
taken
place
on
his
own
plantation
of
five
hundred
african
slaves
in
ten
years
certain
it
is
from
what
i
have
personally
seen
that
the
english
officers
as
a
general
thing
seem
to
be
less
disliked
by
their
crews
than
the
american
officers
by
theirs
the
reason
probably
is
that
many
of
them
from
their
station
in
life
have
been
more
accustomed
to
social
command
hence
authority
sits
more
naturally
on
them
a
coarse
vulgar
man
who
happens
to
rise
to
high
naval
rank
by
the
exhibition
of
talents
not
incompatible
with
vulgarity
invariably
proves
a
tyrant
to
his
crew
it
is
a
thing
that
american
have
often
observed
that
the
lieutenants
from
the
southern
states
the
descendants
of
the
old
virginians
are
much
less
severe
and
much
more
gentle
and
gentlemanly
in
command
than
the
northern
officers
as
a
class
according
to
the
present
laws
and
usages
of
the
navy
a
seaman
for
the
most
trivial
alleged
offences
of
which
he
may
be
entirely
innocent
must
without
a
trial
undergo
a
penalty
the
traces
whereof
he
carries
to
the
grave
for
to
a
experienced
eye
the
marks
of
a
naval
scourging
with
the
are
through
life
discernible
and
with
these
marks
on
his
back
this
image
of
his
creator
must
rise
at
the
last
day
yet
so
untouchable
is
true
dignity
that
there
are
cases
wherein
to
be
flogged
at
the
gangway
is
no
dishonour
though
to
abase
and
hurl
down
the
last
pride
of
some
sailor
who
has
piqued
him
be
the
secret
motive
with
some
malicious
officer
in
procuring
him
to
be
condemned
to
the
lash
but
this
feeling
of
the
innate
dignity
remaining
untouched
though
outwardly
the
body
be
scarred
for
the
whole
term
of
the
natural
life
is
one
of
the
hushed
things
buried
among
the
holiest
privacies
of
the
soul
a
thing
between
a
god
and
himself
and
for
ever
undiscernible
by
our
who
account
a
degradation
which
seems
so
to
the
corporal
eye
but
what
torments
must
that
seaman
undergo
who
while
his
back
bleeds
at
the
gangway
bleeds
agonized
drops
of
shame
from
his
soul
are
we
not
justified
in
immeasurably
denouncing
this
thing
join
hands
with
me
then
and
in
the
name
of
that
being
in
whose
image
the
flogged
sailor
is
made
let
us
demand
of
legislators
by
what
right
they
dare
profane
what
god
himself
accounts
sacred
is
it
lawful
for
you
to
scourge
a
man
that
is
a
roman
asks
the
intrepid
apostle
well
knowing
as
a
roman
citizen
that
it
was
not
and
now
eighteen
hundred
years
after
is
it
lawful
for
you
my
countrymen
to
scourge
a
man
that
is
an
american
to
scourge
him
round
the
world
in
your
frigates
it
is
to
no
purpose
that
you
apologetically
appeal
to
the
general
depravity
of
the
depravity
in
the
oppressed
is
no
apology
for
the
oppressor
but
rather
an
additional
stigma
to
him
as
being
in
a
large
degree
the
effect
and
not
the
cause
and
justification
of
oppression
chapter
xxxv
flogging
not
lawful
it
is
next
to
idle
at
the
present
day
merely
to
denounce
an
iniquity
be
ours
then
a
different
task
if
there
are
any
three
things
opposed
to
the
genius
of
the
american
constitution
they
are
these
irresponsibility
in
a
judge
unlimited
discretionary
authority
in
an
executive
and
the
union
of
an
irresponsible
judge
and
an
unlimited
executive
in
one
person
yet
by
virtue
of
an
enactment
of
congress
all
the
commodores
in
the
american
navy
are
obnoxious
to
these
three
charges
so
far
as
concerns
the
punishment
of
the
sailor
for
alleged
misdemeanors
not
particularly
set
forth
in
the
articles
of
war
here
is
the
enactment
in
question
xxxii
the
articles
of
crimes
committed
by
persons
belonging
to
the
navy
which
are
not
specified
in
the
foregoing
articles
shall
be
punished
according
to
the
laws
and
customs
in
such
cases
at
this
is
the
article
that
above
all
others
puts
the
scourge
into
the
hands
of
the
captain
calls
him
to
no
account
for
its
exercise
and
furnishes
him
with
an
ample
warrant
for
inflictions
of
cruelty
upon
the
common
sailor
hardly
credible
to
landsmen
by
this
article
the
captain
is
made
a
legislator
as
well
as
a
judge
and
an
executive
so
far
as
it
goes
it
absolutely
leaves
to
his
discretion
to
decide
what
things
shall
be
considered
crimes
and
what
shall
be
the
penalty
whether
an
accused
person
has
been
guilty
of
actions
by
him
declared
to
be
crimes
and
how
when
and
where
the
penalty
shall
be
inflicted
in
the
american
navy
there
is
an
everlasting
suspension
of
the
habeas
corpus
upon
the
bare
allegation
of
misconduct
there
is
no
law
to
restrain
the
captain
from
imprisoning
a
seaman
and
keeping
him
confined
at
his
pleasure
while
i
was
in
the
neversink
the
captain
of
an
american
sloop
of
war
from
undoubted
motives
of
personal
pique
kept
a
seaman
confined
in
the
brig
for
upward
of
a
month
certainly
the
necessities
of
navies
warrant
a
code
for
their
government
more
stringent
than
the
law
that
governs
the
land
but
that
code
should
conform
to
the
spirit
of
the
political
institutions
of
the
country
that
ordains
it
it
should
not
convert
into
slaves
some
of
the
citizens
of
a
nation
of
such
objections
can
not
be
urged
against
the
laws
of
the
russian
navy
not
essentially
different
from
our
own
because
the
laws
of
that
navy
creating
the
absolute
power
in
the
captain
and
vesting
in
him
the
authority
to
scourge
conform
in
spirit
to
the
territorial
laws
of
russia
which
is
ruled
by
an
autocrat
and
whose
courts
inflict
the
upon
the
subjects
of
the
land
but
with
us
it
is
different
our
institutions
claim
to
be
based
upon
broad
principles
of
political
liberty
and
equality
whereas
it
would
hardly
affect
one
iota
the
condition
on
shipboard
of
an
american
were
he
transferred
to
the
russian
navy
and
made
a
subject
of
the
czar
as
a
sailor
he
shares
none
of
our
civil
immunities
the
law
of
our
soil
in
no
respect
accompanies
the
national
floating
timbers
grown
thereon
and
to
which
he
clings
as
his
home
for
him
our
revolution
was
in
vain
to
him
our
declaration
of
independence
is
a
lie
it
is
not
sufficiently
borne
in
mind
perhaps
that
though
the
naval
code
comes
under
the
head
of
the
martial
law
yet
in
time
of
peace
and
in
the
thousand
questions
arising
between
man
and
man
on
board
ship
this
code
to
a
certain
extent
may
not
improperly
be
deemed
municipal
with
its
crew
of
or
men
a
is
a
city
on
the
sea
but
in
most
of
these
matters
between
man
and
man
the
captain
instead
of
being
a
magistrate
dispensing
what
the
law
promulgates
is
an
absolute
ruler
making
and
unmaking
law
as
he
pleases
it
will
be
seen
that
the
xxth
of
the
articles
of
war
provides
that
if
any
person
in
the
navy
negligently
perform
the
duties
assigned
him
he
shall
suffer
such
punishment
as
a
shall
adjudge
but
if
the
offender
be
a
private
common
sailor
he
may
at
the
discretion
of
the
captain
be
put
in
irons
or
flogged
it
is
needless
to
say
that
in
cases
where
an
officer
commits
a
trivial
violation
of
this
law
a
is
seldom
or
never
called
to
sit
upon
his
trial
but
in
the
case
he
is
at
once
condemned
to
the
lash
thus
one
set
of
is
exempted
from
a
law
that
is
hung
in
terror
over
others
what
would
landsmen
think
were
the
state
of
new
york
to
pass
a
law
against
some
offence
affixing
a
fine
as
a
penalty
and
then
add
to
that
law
a
section
restricting
its
penal
operation
to
mechanics
and
day
laborers
exempting
all
gentlemen
with
an
income
of
one
thousand
dollars
yet
thus
in
the
spirit
of
its
practical
operation
even
thus
stands
a
good
part
of
the
naval
laws
wherein
naval
flogging
is
involved
but
a
law
should
be
and
include
in
its
possible
penal
operations
the
very
judge
himself
who
gives
decisions
upon
it
nay
the
very
judge
who
expounds
it
had
sir
william
blackstone
violated
the
laws
of
england
he
would
have
been
brought
before
the
bar
over
which
he
had
presided
and
would
there
have
been
tried
with
the
counsel
for
the
crown
reading
to
him
perhaps
from
a
copy
of
his
own
and
should
he
have
been
found
guilty
he
would
have
suffered
like
the
meanest
subject
to
how
is
it
in
an
american
frigate
let
one
example
suffice
by
the
articles
of
war
and
especially
by
article
an
american
captain
may
and
frequently
does
inflict
a
severe
and
degrading
punishment
upon
a
sailor
while
he
himself
is
for
ever
removed
from
the
possibility
of
undergoing
the
like
disgrace
and
in
all
probability
from
undergoing
any
punishment
whatever
even
if
guilty
of
the
same
with
his
equals
for
which
he
punishes
another
yet
both
sailor
and
captain
are
american
citizens
now
in
the
language
of
blackstone
again
there
is
a
law
with
mankind
dictated
by
god
himself
superior
in
obligation
to
any
other
and
no
human
laws
are
of
any
validity
if
contrary
to
that
law
is
the
law
of
nature
among
the
three
great
principles
of
which
justinian
includes
to
every
man
should
be
rendered
his
but
we
have
seen
that
the
laws
involving
flogging
in
the
navy
do
render
to
every
man
his
due
since
in
some
cases
they
indirectly
exclude
the
officers
from
any
punishment
whatever
and
in
all
cases
protect
them
from
the
scourge
which
is
inflicted
upon
the
sailor
therefore
according
to
blackstone
and
justinian
those
laws
have
no
binding
force
and
every
american
would
be
morally
justified
in
resisting
the
scourge
to
the
uttermost
and
in
so
resisting
would
be
religiously
justified
in
what
would
be
judicially
styled
act
of
itself
if
then
these
scourging
laws
be
for
any
reason
necessary
make
them
binding
upon
all
who
of
right
come
under
their
sway
and
let
us
see
an
honest
commodore
duly
authorised
by
congress
condemning
to
the
lash
a
transgressing
captain
by
the
side
of
a
transgressing
sailor
and
if
the
commodore
himself
prove
a
transgressor
let
us
see
one
of
his
brother
commodores
take
up
the
lash
against
even
as
the
mates
the
navy
executioners
are
often
called
upon
to
scourge
each
other
or
will
you
say
that
a
navy
officer
is
a
man
but
that
an
citizen
whose
grandsire
may
have
ennobled
him
by
pouring
out
his
blood
at
bunker
you
say
that
by
entering
the
service
of
his
country
as
a
common
seaman
and
standing
ready
to
fight
her
foes
he
thereby
loses
his
manhood
at
the
very
time
he
most
asserts
it
will
you
say
that
by
so
doing
he
degrades
himself
to
the
liability
of
the
scourge
but
if
he
tarries
ashore
in
time
of
danger
he
is
safe
from
that
indignity
all
our
linked
states
all
four
continents
of
mankind
unite
in
denouncing
such
a
thought
we
plant
the
question
then
on
the
topmost
argument
of
all
irrespective
of
incidental
considerations
we
assert
that
flogging
in
the
navy
is
opposed
to
the
essential
dignity
of
man
which
no
legislator
has
a
right
to
violate
that
it
is
oppressive
and
glaringly
unequal
in
its
operations
that
it
is
utterly
repugnant
to
the
spirit
of
our
democratic
institutions
indeed
that
it
involves
a
lingering
trait
of
the
worst
times
of
a
barbarous
feudal
aristocracy
in
a
word
we
denounce
it
as
religiously
morally
and
immutably
no
matter
then
what
may
be
the
consequences
of
its
abolition
no
matter
if
we
have
to
dismantle
our
fleets
and
our
unprotected
commerce
should
fall
a
prey
to
the
spoiler
the
awful
admonitions
of
justice
and
humanity
demand
that
abolition
without
procrastination
in
a
voice
that
is
not
to
be
mistaken
demand
that
abolition
today
it
is
not
a
question
of
expediency
it
is
a
matter
of
and
and
if
any
man
can
lay
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
solemnly
say
that
this
scourging
is
right
let
that
man
but
once
feel
the
lash
on
his
own
back
and
in
his
agony
you
will
hear
the
apostate
call
the
seventh
heavens
to
witness
that
it
is
and
in
the
name
of
immortal
manhood
would
to
god
that
every
man
who
upholds
this
thing
were
scourged
at
the
gangway
till
he

flogging
not
necessary
but
is
ready
to
come
down
from
the
lofty
of

eternal
principle

them
to
collingwood
said
lord
nelson
will
bring
them
to
this
was
the
language
of
that
renowned
admiral
when
his
officers
reported
to
him
certain
seamen
of
the
fleet
as
wholly
ungovernable
them
to
and
who
was
collingwood
that
after
these
navy
rebels
had
been
imprisoned
and
scourged
without
being
brought
to
order
collingwood
could
convert
them
to
docility
who
admiral
collinngwood
was
as
an
historical
hero
history
herself
will
tell
you
nor
in
whatever
triumphal
hall
they
may
be
hanging
will
the
captured
flags
of
trafalgar
fail
to
rustle
at
the
mention
of
that
name
but
what
collingwood
was
as
a
disciplinarian
on
board
the
ships
he
commanded
perhaps
needs
to
be
said
he
was
an
officer
then
who
held
in
abhorrence
all
corporal
punishment
who
though
seeing
more
active
service
than
any
of
his
time
yet
for
years
together
governed
his
men
without
inflicting
the
lash
but
these
seaman
of
his
must
have
been
most
exemplary
saints
to
have
proved
docile
under
so
lenient
a
sway
were
they
saints
answer
ye
jails
and
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
great
britain
which
in
time
were
swept
clean
of
the
last
lingering
villain
and
pauper
to
man
his
fleets
still
more
was
a
period
when
the
uttermost
resources
of
england
were
taxed
to
the
quick
when
the
masts
of
her
multiplied
fleets
almost
transplanted
her
forests
all
standing
to
the
sea
when
british
not
only
boarded
foreign
ships
on
the
high
seas
and
boarded
foreign
but
boarded
their
own
merchantmen
at
the
mouth
of
the
thames
and
boarded
the
very
along
its
banks
when
englishmen
were
knocked
down
and
dragged
into
the
navy
like
cattle
into
the
with
every
mortal
provocation
to
a
mad
desperation
against
the
service
that
thus
ran
their
unwilling
heads
into
the
muzzles
of
the
cannon
was
the
time
and
the
men
that
collingwood
governed
without
the
lash
i
know
it
has
been
said
that
lord
collingwood
began
by
inflicting
severe
punishments
and
afterward
ruling
his
sailors
by
the
mere
memory
of
a
terror
which
he
could
at
pleasure
revive
and
that
his
sailors
knew
this
and
hence
their
good
behaviour
under
a
lenient
sway
but
granting
the
quoted
assertion
to
be
true
how
comes
it
that
many
american
captains
who
after
inflicting
as
severe
punishment
as
ever
collingwood
could
have
comes
it
that
also
have
not
been
able
to
maintain
good
order
without
subsequent
floggings
after
once
showing
to
the
crew
with
what
terrible
attributes
they
were
invested
but
it
is
notorious
and
a
thing
that
i
myself
in
several
instances
to
have
been
the
case
that
in
the
american
navy
where
corporal
punishment
has
been
most
severe
it
has
also
been
most
frequent
but
it
is
incredible
that
with
such
crews
as
lord
in
part
of
the
most
desperate
characters
the
rakings
of
the
is
incredible
that
such
a
set
of
men
could
have
been
governed
by
the
mere
of
the
lash
some
other
influence
must
have
been
brought
to
bear
mainly
no
doubt
the
influence
wrought
by
a
powerful
brain
and
a
determined
intrepid
spirit
over
a
miscellaneous
rabble
it
is
well
known
that
lord
nelson
himself
in
point
of
policy
was
averse
to
flogging
and
that
too
when
he
had
witnessed
the
mutinous
effects
of
government
abuses
in
the
in
our
which
to
the
terror
of
all
england
developed
themselves
at
the
great
mutiny
of
the
nore
an
outbreak
that
for
several
weeks
jeopardised
the
very
existence
of
the
british
navy
but
we
may
press
this
thing
nearly
two
centuries
further
back
for
it
is
a
matter
of
historical
doubt
whether
in
robert
time
great
admiral
such
a
thing
as
flogging
was
known
at
the
gangways
of
his
victorious
fleets
and
as
in
this
matter
we
can
not
go
further
back
than
to
blake
so
we
can
not
advance
further
than
to
our
own
time
which
shows
commodore
stockton
during
the
recent
war
with
mexico
governing
the
american
squadron
in
the
pacific
without
employing
the
scourge
but
if
of
three
famous
english
admirals
one
has
abhorred
flogging
another
almost
governed
his
ships
without
it
and
to
the
third
it
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
unknown
while
an
american
commander
has
within
the
present
year
almost
been
enabled
to
sustain
the
good
discipline
of
an
entire
squadron
in
time
of
war
without
having
an
instrument
of
scourging
on
board
what
inevitable
inferences
must
be
drawn
and
how
disastrous
to
the
mental
character
of
all
advocates
of
navy
flogging
who
may
happen
to
be
navy
officers
themselves
it
can
not
have
escaped
the
discernment
of
any
observer
of
mankind
that
in
the
presence
of
its
conventional
inferiors
conscious
imbecility
in
power
often
seeks
to
carry
off
that
imbecility
by
assumptions
of
lordly
severity
the
amount
of
flogging
on
board
an
american
is
in
many
cases
in
exact
proportion
to
the
professional
and
intellectual
incapacity
of
her
officers
to
command
thus
in
these
cases
the
law
that
authorises
flogging
does
but
put
a
scourge
into
the
hand
of
a
fool
in
most
calamitous
instances
this
has
been
shown
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
some
english
ships
of
war
have
fallen
a
prey
to
the
enemy
through
the
insubordination
of
the
crew
induced
by
the
witless
cruelty
of
their
officers
officers
so
armed
by
the
law
that
they
could
inflict
that
cruelty
without
restraint
nor
have
there
been
wanting
instances
where
the
seamen
have
ran
away
with
their
ships
as
in
the
case
of
the
hermione
and
danae
and
forever
rid
themselves
of
the
outrageous
inflictions
of
their
officers
by
sacrificing
their
lives
to
their
fury
events
like
these
aroused
the
attention
of
the
british
public
at
the
time
but
it
was
a
tender
theme
the
public
agitation
of
which
the
government
was
anxious
to
suppress
nevertheless
whenever
the
thing
was
privately
discussed
these
terrific
mutinies
together
with
the
then
prevailing
insubordination
of
the
men
in
the
navy
were
almost
universally
attributed
to
the
exasperating
system
of
flogging
and
the
necessity
for
flogging
was
generally
believed
to
be
directly
referable
to
the
impressment
of
such
crowds
of
dissatisfied
men
and
in
high
quarters
it
was
held
that
if
by
any
mode
the
english
fleet
could
be
manned
without
resource
to
coercive
measures
then
the
necessity
of
flogging
would
cease
we
abolish
either
impressment
or
flogging
the
abolition
of
the
other
will
follow
as
a
matter
of
this
was
the
language
of
the
at
a
still
later
period
if
then
the
necessity
of
flogging
in
the
british
armed
marine
was
solely
attributed
to
the
impressment
of
the
seamen
what
faintest
shadow
of
reason
is
there
for
the
continuance
of
this
barbarity
in
the
american
service
which
is
wholly
freed
from
the
reproach
of
impressment
it
is
true
that
during
a
long
period
of
and
even
down
to
the
present
day
flogging
has
been
and
still
is
the
law
of
the
english
navy
but
in
things
of
this
kind
england
should
be
nothing
to
us
except
an
example
to
be
shunned
nor
should
wise
legislators
wholly
govern
themselves
by
precedents
and
conclude
that
since
scourging
has
so
long
prevailed
some
virtue
must
reside
in
it
not
so
the
world
has
arrived
at
a
period
which
renders
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
pay
homage
to
the
prospective
precedents
of
the
future
in
preference
to
those
of
the
past
the
past
is
dead
and
has
no
resurrection
but
the
future
is
endowed
with
such
a
life
that
it
lives
to
us
even
in
anticipation
the
past
is
in
many
things
the
foe
of
mankind
the
future
is
in
all
things
our
friend
in
the
past
is
no
hope
the
future
is
both
hope
and
fruition
the
past
is
the
of
tyrants
the
future
the
bible
of
the
free
those
who
are
solely
governed
by
the
past
stand
like
wife
crystallised
in
the
act
of
looking
backward
and
forever
incapable
of
looking
before
let
us
leave
the
past
then
to
dictate
laws
to
immovable
china
let
us
abandon
it
to
the
chinese
legitimists
of
europe
but
for
us
we
will
have
another
captain
to
rule
over
captain
who
ever
marches
at
the
head
of
his
troop
and
beckons
them
forward
not
lingering
in
the
rear
and
impeding
their
march
with
lumbering
of
old
precedents
is
the
past
but
in
many
things
we
americans
are
driven
to
a
rejection
of
the
maxims
of
the
past
seeing
that
ere
long
the
van
of
the
nations
must
of
right
belong
to
ourselves
there
are
occasions
when
it
is
for
america
to
make
precedents
and
not
to
obey
them
we
should
if
possible
prove
a
teacher
to
posterity
instead
of
being
the
pupil
of
generations
more

come
after
us

xxxvii
some
superior
old
from
the
of
neptune
we
had
just
slid
into
pleasant
weather
drawing
near
to
the
tropics
when
all
hands
were
thrown
into
a
wonderful
excitement
by
an
event
that
eloquently
appealed
to
many
palates
a
man
at
the
sung
out
that
there
were
eight
or
ten
dark
objects
floating
on
the
sea
some
three
points
off
our
her
off
three
points
cried
captain
claret
to
the
at
the
and
thus
with
all
our
batteries
and
five
hundred
men
with
their
baggage
and
beds
and
provisions
at
one
move
of
a
round
bit
of
mahogany
our
ark
edged
away
for
the
strangers
as
easily
as
a
boy
turns
to
the
right
or
left
in
pursuit
of
insects
in
the
field
directly
the
man
on
the
reported
the
dark
objects
to
be
hogsheads
instantly
all
the
were
straining
their
eyes
in
delirious
expectation
of
having
their
long
broken
at
last
and
that
too
by
what
seemed
an
almost
miraculous
intervention
it
was
a
curious
circumstance
that
without
knowing
the
contents
of
the
hogsheads
they
yet
seemed
certain
that
the
staves
encompassed
the
thing
they
longed
for
sail
was
now
shortened
our
headway
was
stopped
and
a
cutter
was
lowered
with
orders
to
tow
the
fleet
of
strangers
alongside
the
men
sprang
to
their
oars
with
a
will
and
soon
five
goodly
puncheons
lay
wallowing
in
the
sea
just
under
the
we
got
overboard
the
slings
and
hoisted
them
out
of
the
water
it
was
a
sight
that
bacchus
and
his
bacchanals
would
have
gloated
over
each
puncheon
was
of
a
color
so
covered
with
minute
barnacles
and
and
streaming
with
that
it
needed
long
searching
to
find
out
their
they
looked
like
venerable
old
how
long
they
had
been
tossing
about
and
making
voyages
for
the
benefit
of
the
flavour
of
their
contents
no
one
could
tell
in
trying
to
raft
them
ashore
or
on
board
of
some
they
must
have
drifted
off
to
sea
this
we
inferred
from
the
ropes
that
united
them
and
which
from
one
point
of
view
made
them
resemble
a
long
they
were
into
the
where
the
eager
crowd
being
kept
off
by
sentries
the
cooper
was
called
with
his
tools
up
and
bilge
free
he
cried
in
an
ecstasy
flourishing
his
driver
and
hammer
upon
clearing
away
the
barnacles
and
moss
a
flat
sort
of
was
found
closely
adhering
like
a
right
over
one
of
the
bungs
doubtless
this
had
there
taken
up
his
quarters
and
thrown
his
own
body
into
the
breach
in
order
the
better
to
preserve
the
precious
contents
of
the
cask
the
were
breathless
when
at
last
this
puncheon
was
canted
over
and
a
held
to
the
orifice

was
to

forth
or
wine
but
a
rich
purple
tide
soon
settled
the
question
and

lieutenant
assigned
to
taste
it
with
a
loud
and
satisfactory
smack
of
his
lips
pronounced
it
port
cried
mad
jack
no
mistake
but
to
the
surprise
grief
and
consternation
of
the
sailors
an
order
now
came
from
the
to
strike
the
down
into
the
this
proceeding
occasioned
all
sorts
of
censorious
observations
upon
the
captain
who
of
course
had
authorised
it
it
must
be
related
here
that
on
the
passage
out
from
home
the
neversink
had
touched
at
madeira
and
there
as
is
often
the
case
with
the
commodore
and
captain
had
laid
in
a
goodly
stock
of
wines
for
their
own
private
tables
and
the
benefit
of
their
foreign
visitors
and
although
the
commodore
was
a
small
spare
man
who
evidently
emptied
but
few
glasses
yet
captain
claret
was
a
portly
gentleman
with
a
crimson
face
whose
father
had
fought
at
the
battle
of
the
brandywine
and
whose
brother
had
commanded
the
frigate
named
in
honour
of
that
engagement
and
his
whole
appearance
evinced
that
captain
claret
himself
had
fought
many
brandywine
battles
ashore
in
honour
of
his
memory
and
commanded
in
many
bloodless
brandywine
actions
at
sea
it
was
therefore
with
some
savour
of
provocation
that
the
sailors
held
forth
on
the
ungenerous
conduct
of
captain
claret
in
stepping
in
between
them
and
providence
as
it
were
which
by
this
lucky
windfall
they
held
seemed
bent
upon
relieving
their
necessities
while
captain
claret
himself
with
an
inexhaustible
cellar
emptied
his
madeira
decanters
at
his
leisure
but
next
day
all
hands
were
electrified
by
the
old
familiar
long
the
drum
rolling
to
grog
after
that
the
port
was
served
out

a
day

all
was

that

indeed
no
sundays
on

you
may
as
well
say
there
should
be
no

not

and

not

peal
every

morning
to
summon
the
crew
to
devotions
at
any
rate
there
were
sundays
on
board
this
particular
frigate
of
ours
and
a
clergyman
also
he
was
a
slender
man
of
an
amiable
deportment
and
irreproachable
conversation
but
i
must
say
that
his
sermons
were
but
ill
calculated
to
benefit
the
crew
he
had
drank
at
the
mystic
fountain
of
plato
his
head
had
been
turned
by
the
germans
and
this
i
will
say
that
himself

him

biographia

his
hand

now
this
transcendental
divine
standing
behind
a
on

five
hundred
sinners
upon
the
psychological
phenomena
of
the

and
the
ontological
necessity
of
every
saving

all
hazards

ancient
philosophers

of

the
follies
of
commentary
on
coelo
by
arraying
against
that
clever
pagan
author
the
admired
tract
of
prascriptionibus
concluded
by
a
sanscrit
invocation
he
was
particularly
hard
upon
the
gnostics
and
marcionites
of
the
second
century
of
the
christian
era
but
he
never
in
the
remotest
manner
attacked
the
everyday
vices
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
eminently
illustrated
in
our
world
concerning
drunkenness
fighting
flogging
and
expressly
or
impliedly
prohibited

never

the

mighty

in

if
in
a
monarchy

state
form
the
audience
of
the
church
little
evangelical
piety
will
be
preached
hence
the
harmless
abstrusities
of
our
chaplain
were
not
to
be
wondered
at
he
was
no
massillon
to
thunder
forth
his
ecclesiastical
rhetoric
even
when
a
louis
le
grand
was
enthroned
among
his
congregation
nor
did
the
chaplains
who
preached
on
the
of
lord
nelson
ever
allude
to
the
guilty
felix
nor
to
delilah
nor
practically
reason
of
righteousness
temperance
and
judgment
to
come
when
that
renowned
admiral
sat
before
them
during
these
sunday
discourses
the
officers
always
sat
in
a
circle
round
the
chaplain
and
with
a
air
steadily
preserved
the
utmost
propriety
in
particular
our
old
commodore
himself
made
a
point
of
looking
intensely
edified
and
not
a
sailor
on
board
but
believed
that
the
commodore
being
the
greatest
man
present
must
alone
comprehend
the
mystic
sentences
that
fell
from
our
lips
of
all
the
noble
lords
in
the
this
with
the
exception
of
the
purser
was
in
the
highest
favour
with
the
commodore
who
frequently
conversed
with
him
in
a
close
and
confidential
manner
nor
upon
reflection
was
this
to
be
marvelled
at
seeing
how
efficacious
in
all
despotic
governments
it
is
for
the
throne
and
altar
to
go
the
accommodations
of
our
chapel
were
very
poor
we
had
nothing
to
sit
on
but
the
great
and
placed
horizontally
upon
these
seats
were
exceedingly
uncomfortable
wearing
out
our
trowsers
and
our
tempers
and
no
doubt
impeded
the
of
many
valuable
souls
to
say
the
truth
in
general
make
but
poor
auditors
upon
these
occasions
and
adopt
every
possible
means
to
elude
them
often
the
were
obliged
to
drive
the
men
to
service
violently
swearing
upon
these
occasions
as
upon
every
other

in
one
instance
grave

was
taken
to
this
summons

remarkably
serious
but
bigoted
seaman

may
hereafter
be
alluded
touched
his
hat
to
the
captain
and
respectfully
said
i
am
a
baptist
the
chaplain
is
an
episcopalian
his
form
of
worship
is
not
mine
i
do
not
believe
with
him
and
it
is
against
my
conscience
to
be
under
his
ministry
may
i
be
allowed
sir
to
attend
service
on
the
will
be
allowed
sir
said
the
captain
haughtily
obey
the
laws
of
the
ship
if
you
absent
yourself
from
prayers
on
sunday
mornings
you
know
the
according
to
the
articles
of
war
the
captain
was
perfectly
right
but
if
any
law
requiring
an
american
to
attend
divine
service
against
his
will
be
a
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
then
the
articles
of
war
are
in
this
one
particular
opposed
to
the
american
constitution
which
expressly
says
shall
make
no
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
or
the
free
exercise
but
this
is
only
one
of
several
things
in
which
the
articles
of
war
are
repugnant
to
that
instrument
they
will
be
glanced
at
in
another
part
of
the
narrative
the
motive
which
prompts
the
introduction
of
chaplains
into
the
navy
can
not
but
be
warmly
responded
to
by
every
christian
but
it
does
not
follow
that
because
chaplains
are
to
be
found
in
that
under
the
present
system
they
achieve
much
good
or
that
under
any
other
they
ever
will
how
can
it
be
expected
that
the
religion
of
peace
should
flourish
in
an
oaken
castle
of
war
how
can
it
be
expected
that
the
clergyman
whose
pulpit
is
a
should
convert
sinners
to
a
faith
that
enjoins
them
to
turn
the
right
cheek
when
the
left
is
smitten
how
is
it
to
be
expected
that
when
according
to
the
xlii
of
the
articles
of
war
as
they
now
stand
unrepealed
on
the
bounty
shall
be
to
the
officers
and
crew
the
united
states
government
of
for
each
person
on
board
any
ship
of
an
enemy
which
shall
be
sunk
or
destroyed
by
any
united
states
ship
and
when
by
a
subsequent
section
vii
it
is
provided
among
other
apportionings
that
the
chaplain
shall
receive
of
this
price
paid
for
sinking
and
destroying
ships
full
of
human
beings
how
is
it
to
be
expected
that
a
clergyman
thus
provided
for
should
prove
efficacious
in
enlarging
upon
the
criminality
of
judas
who
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
betrayed
his
master
although
by
the
regulations
of
the
navy
each
mess
on
board
the
was
furnished
with
a
bible
these
bibles
were
seldom
or
never
to
be
seen
except
on
sunday
mornings
when
usage
demands
that
they
shall
be
exhibited
by
the
cooks
of
the
messes
when
the
goes
his
rounds
on
the
at
such
times
they
usually
surmounted
a
placed
on
the
lid
of
the
chest
yet
for
all
this
the
christianity
of
men
and
their
disposition
to
contribute
to
pious
enterprises
are
often
relied
upon
several
times
subscription
papers
were
circulated
among
the
crew
of
the
neversink
while
in
harbour
under
the
direct
patronage
of
the
chaplain
one
was
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
chapel
in
china
another
to
pay
the
salary
of
a
in
greece
a
third
to
raise
a
fund
for
the
benefit
of
an
african
colonization
society
where
the
captain
himself
is
a
moral
man
he
makes
a
far
better
chaplain
for
his
crew
than
any
clergyman
can
be
this
is
sometimes
illustrated
in
the
case
of
sloops
of
war
and
armed
brigs
which
are
not
allowed
a
regular
chaplain
i
have
known
one
crew
who
were
warmly
attached
to
a
naval
commander
worthy
of
their
love
who
have
mustered
even
with
alacrity
to
the
call
to
prayer
and
when
their
captain
would
read
the
church
of
england
service
to
them
would
present
a
congregation
not
to
be
surpassed
for
earnestness
and
devotion
by
any
scottish
kirk
it
seemed
like
family
devotions
where
the
head
of
the
house
is
foremost
in
confessing
himself
before
his
maker
but
our
own
hearts
are
our
best
and
the
chaplains
who
can
most
help
us
are
ourselves

of

as
mention
has
just

boats
employed

something
more
may
as

be
put
down
concerning
them
our

carried
a

big
as
a
small
a
which
was
generally
used
for
getting
off
wood
water
and
other
bulky
articles
besides
this
she
carried
four
boats
of
an
arithmetical
progression
in
point
of
largest
being
known
as
the
first
cutter
the
next
largest
the
second
cutter
then
the
third
and
fourth
cutters
she
also
carried
a
barge
a
gig
and
a
a
small
yawl
with
a
crew
of
apprentice
boys
all
these
boats
except
the
had
their
regular
crews
who
were
subordinate
to
their
receiving
pay
in
addition
to
their
wages
the
was
manned
by
the
old
tritons
of
the
forecastle
who
were
no
ways
particular
about
their
dress
while
the
other
for
genteeler
rowed
by
young
follows
mostly
who
had
a
dandy
eye
to
their
personal
appearance
above
all
the
officers
see
to
it
that
the
barge
and
the
gig
are
manned
by
gentlemanly
youths
who
may
do
credit
to
their
country
and
form
agreeable
objects
for
the
eyes
of
the
commodore
or
captain
to
repose
upon
as
he
tranquilly
sits
in
the
stern
when
pulled
ashore
by
his
or
as
the
case
may
be
some
sailors
are
very
fond
of
belonging
to
the
boats
and
deem
it
a
great
honour
to
be
a
but
others
perceiving
no
particular
distinction
in
that
office
do
not
court
it
so
much
on
the
second
day
after
arriving
at
rio
one
of
the
fell
sick
and
to
my
no
small
concern
i
found
myself
temporarily
appointed
to
his
place
rig
yourself
in
the
uniform
you
are
a
my
ye
joy
this
was
the
first
announcement
of
the
fact
that
i
heard
but
soon
after
it
was
officially
ratified
i
was
about
to
seek
the
first
lieutenant
and
plead
the
scantiness
of
my
wardrobe
which
wholly
disqualified
me
to
fill
so
distinguished
a
station
when
i
heard
the
bugler
call
away
the
and
without
more
ado
i
slipped
into
a
clean
frock
which
a
messmate
doffed
for
my
benefit
and
soon
after
found
myself
pulling
off
his
high
mightiness
the
captain
to
an
english
as
we
were
bounding
along
the
cockswain
suddenly
cried
at
the
word
every
oar
was
suspended
in
the
air
while
our
barge
floated
by
bearing
that
dignitary
himself
at
the
sight
captain
claret
removed
his
chapeau
and
saluted
profoundly
our
boat
lying
motionless
on
the
water
but
the
barge
never
stopped
and
the
commodore
made
but
a
slight
return
to
the
obsequious
salute
he
had
received
we
then
resumed
rowing
and
presently
i
heard
again
but
from
another
boat
the
second
cutter
which
turned
out
to
be
carrying
a
lieutenant
ashore
if
was
now
captain
turn
to
be
honoured
the
cutter
lay
still
and
the
lieutenant
off
hat
while
the
captain
only
nodded
and
we
kept
on
our
way
this
naval
etiquette
is
very
much
like
the
etiquette
at
the
grand
porte
of
constantinople
where
after
washing
the
sublime
feet
the
grand
vizier
avenges
himself
on
an
emir
who
does
the
same
office
for
him
when
we
arrived
aboard
the
english
the
captain
was
received
with
the
usual
honours
and
the
crew
were
conducted
below
and
hospitably
regaled
with
some
spirits
served
out
by
order
of
the
officer
of
the
deck
soon
after
the
english
crew
went
to
quarters
and
as
they
stood
up
at
their
guns
all
along
the
a
row
of
britons
fellows
i
was
struck
with
the
contrast
they
afforded
to
similar
sights
on
board
of
the
neversink
for
on
board
of
us
our
showed
an
array
of
rather
slender
chaps
but
then
i
made
no
doubt
that
in
a
these
varlets
would
have
approved
themselves
as
slender
damascus
blades
nimble
and
flexible
whereas
these
britons
would
have
been
perhaps
as
sturdy
broadswords
yet
every
one
remembers
that
story
of
saladin
and
richard
trying
their
respective
blades
how
gallant
richard
clove
an
anvil
in
twain
or
something
quite
as
ponderous
and
saladin
elegantly
severed
a
cushion
so
that
the
two
monarchs
were
excelling
in
his
unfortunately
for
my
simile
in
a
patriotic
point
of
view
richard
whipped
armies
in
the
end
there
happened
to
be
a
lord
on
board
of
this
younger
son
of
an
earl
they
told
me
he
was
a
fellow
i
chanced
to
stand
by
when
he
put
a
question
to
an
irish
captain
of
a
gum
upon
the
inadvertently
saying
sir
to
him
his
lordship
looked
daggers
at
the
slight
and
the
sailor
touching
his
hat
a
thousand
times
said
your
honour
i
meant
to
say
sir
i
was
much
pleased
with
an
old
musician
who
stood
at
the
main
hatchway
with
his
enormous
bass
drum
full
before
him
and
thumping
it
sturdily
to
the
tune
of
save
the
king
though
small
mercy
did
he
have
on
his
two
little
boys
were
clashing
cymbals
and
another
was
blowing
a
fife
with
his
cheeks
puffed
out
like
the
plumpest
of
his
when
we
returned
from
this
trip
there
again
took
place
that
ceremonious
reception
of
our
captain
on
board
the
vessel
he
commanded
which
always
had
struck
me
as
exceedingly
diverting
in
the
first
place
while
in
port
one
of
the
is
always
stationed
on
the
poop
with
a
to
look
out
for
all
boats
approaching
and
report
the
same
to
the
officer
of
the
deck
also
who
it
is
that
may
be
coming
in
them
so
that
preparations
may
be
made
accordingly
as
soon
then
as
the
gig
touched
the
side
a
mighty
shrill
piping
was
heard
as
if
some
boys
were
celebrating
the
fourth
of
july
with
penny
whistles
this
proceeded
from
a
mate
who
standing
at
the
gangway
was
thus
honouring
the
return
after
his
long
and
perilous
absence
the
captain
then
slowly
mounted
the
ladder
and
gravely
marching
through
a
lane
of
so
in
their
best
bibs
and
tuckers
and
who
stood
making
sly
faces
behind
his
received
by
all
the
lieutenants
in
a
body
their
hats
in
their
hands
and
making
a
prodigious
scraping
and
bowing
as
if
they
had
just
graduated
at
a
french
meanwhile
preserving
an
erect
inflexible
and
carriage
and
slightly
touching
his
chapeau
the
captain
made
his
ceremonious
way
to
the
cabin
disappearing
behind
the
scenes
like
the
pasteboard
ghost
in
hamlet
but
these
ceremonies
are
nothing
to
those
in
homage
of
the
arrival
even
should
he
depart
and
arrive
twenty
times
a
day
upon
such
occasions
the
whole
marine
guard
except
the
sentries
on
duty
are
marshalled
on
the
presenting
arms
as
the
commodore
passes
them
while
their
commanding
officer
gives
the
military
salute
with
his
sword
as
if
making
masonic
signs
meanwhile
the
boatswain
a
keeping
up
a
persevering
whistling
with
his
silver
pipe
for
the
commodore
is
never
greeted
with
the
rude
whistle
of
a
subaltern
would
be
positively
insulting
all
the
lieutenants
and
midshipmen
besides
the
captain
himself
are
drawn
up
in
a
phalanx
and
off
hat
together
and
the
whose
number
is
now
increased
to
ten
or
twelve
make
an
imposing
display
at
the
gangway
while
the
whole
brass
band
elevated
upon
the
poop
strike
up
the
conquering
hero
comes
at
least
this
was
the
tune
that
our
captain
always
hinted
by
a
gesture
to
the
captain
of
the
band
whenever
the
commodore
arrived
from
shore
it
conveyed
a
complimentary
appreciation
on
the
part
of
the
heroism
during
the
late
war
to
return
to
the
gig
as
i
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
being
a
sort
of
to
captain

often
called
upon
to
scrub
his
cabin
floor
and
perform
other
duties
for
made
it
my
particular
business
to
get
rid
of
my
appointment
in
his
boat
as
soon
as
possible
and
the
next
day
after
receiving
it
succeeded
in
procuring
a
substitute
who
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
fill
the
position
i
so
much
undervalued
and
thus
with
our
counterlikes
and
dislikes
most
of
us
harmoniously
into
each
other
and
by
our
very
points
of
opposition
unite
in
a
clever
whole
like
the
parts
of
a
chinese
puzzle
but
as
in
a
chinese
puzzle
many
pieces
are
hard
to
place
so
there
are
some
unfortunate
fellows
who
can
never
slip
into
their
proper
angles
and
thus
the
whole
puzzle
becomes
a
puzzle
indeed
which
is
the
precise
condition
of
the
greatest
puzzle
in
the
world
itself
chapter

some
of
the
ceremonies
in
a
unnecessary
and
injurious
the
ceremonials
of
a
some
of
which
have
been
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
may
merit
a
reflection
or
two
the
general
usages
of
the
american
navy
are
founded
upon
the
usages
that
prevailed
in
the
navy
of
monarchical
england
more
than
a
century
ago
nor
have
they
been
materially
altered
since
and
while
both
england
and
america
have
become
greatly
liberalised
in
the
interval
while
shore
pomp
in
high
places
has
come
to
be
regarded
by
the
more
intelligent
masses
of
men
as
belonging
to
the
absurd
ridiculous
and
while
that
most
truly
august
of
all
the
majesties
of
earth
the
president
of
the
united
states
may
be
seen
entering
his
residence
with
his
umbrella
under
his
arm
and
no
brass
band
or
military
guard
at
his
heels
and
unostentatiously
taking
his
seat
by
the
side
of
the
meanest
citizen
in
a
public
conveyance
while
this
is
the
case
there
still
lingers
in
american
all
the
stilted
etiquette
and
childish
parade
of
the
spanish
court
of
madrid
indeed
so
far
as
the
things
that
meet
the
eye
are
concerned
an
american
commodore
is
by
far
a
greater
man
than
the
president
of
twenty
millions
of
freemen
but
we
plain
people
ashore
might
very
willingly
be
content
to
leave
these
commodores
in
the
unmolested
possession
of
their
gilded
penny
whistles
rattles
and
gewgaws
since
they
seem
to
take
so
much
pleasure
in
them
were
it
not
that
all
this
is
attended
by
consequences
to
their
subordinates
in
the
last
degree
to
be
deplored
while
hardly
any
one
will
question
that
a
naval
officer
should
be
surrounded
by
circumstances
calculated
to
impart
a
requisite
dignity
to
his
position
it
is
not
the
less
certain
that
by
the
excessive
pomp
he
at
present
maintains
there
is
naturally
and
unavoidably
generated
a
feeling
of
servility
and
debasement
in
the
hearts
of
most
of
the
seamen
who
continually
behold
a
flourishing
over
their
heads
like
the
archangel
michael
with
a
thousand
wings
and
as
in
degree
this
same
pomp
is
observed
toward
their
inferiors
by
all
the
grades
of
commissioned
officers
even
down
to
a
midshipman
the
evil
is
proportionately
multiplied
it
would
not
at
all
diminish
a
proper
respect
for
the
officers
and
subordination
to
their
authority
among
the
seamen
were
all
this
idle
ministering
to
the
arrogance
of
the
officers
without
at
all
benefiting
the
done
away
but
to
do
so
we
voters
and
lawgivers
ourselves
must
be
no
respecters
of
persons
that
saying
about
upward
and
not
may
seem
very
fine
to
those
who
can
not
see
its
absurdity
but
the
truth
is
that
to
gain
the
true
level
in
some
things
we
cut
downward
for
how
can
you
make
every
sailor
a
commodore
or
how
raise
the
valleys
without
filling
them
up
with
the
superfluous
tops
of
the
hills
some
discreet
but
democratic
legislation
in
this
matter
is
much
to
be
desired
and
by
bringing
down
naval
officers
in
these
things
at
least
without
affecting
their
legitimate
dignity
and
authority
we
shall
correspondingly
elevate
the
common
sailor
without
relaxing
the
subordination
in
which
he
should
by
all
means
be
retained

a
library
nowhere
does

pass
more
heavily
than
with
most
on
board
their
craft
in
harbour
one
of
my
principal
antidotes
against
in
rio
was
reading
there
was
a
public
library
on
board
paid
for
by
government
and
intrusted
to
the
custody
of
one
of
the
marine
corporals
a
little
man
of
a
somewhat
literary
turn
he
had
once
been
a
clerk
in
a
ashore
and
having
been
long
accustomed
to
hand
over
letters
when
called
for
he
was
now
just
the
man
to
hand
over
books
he
kept
them
in
a
large
cask
on
the
and
when
seeking
a
particular
volume
had
to
capsize
it
like
a
barrel
of
potatoes
this
made
him
very
cross
and
irritable
as
most
all
librarians
are
who
had
the
selection
of
these
books
i
do
not
know

some
of
them
must
have
been
selected
by
our

pranced

toward

filled
with
remorse
for

crimes
that

roaring
about

travellers
out

that
the
islanders
bitterly
lamented

somehow
the

killing
time
in
a
in

reading
was
by
no
means
the
only
method
adopted
by
my
shipmates
in
whiling
away
the
long
tedious
hours
in
harbour
in
truth
many
of
them
could
not
have
read
had
they
wanted
to
ever
so
much
in
early
youth
their
primers
had
been
sadly
neglected
still
they
had
other
pursuits
some
were
experts
at
the
needle
and
employed
their
time
in
making
elaborate
shirts
stitching
picturesque
eagles
and
anchors
and
all
the
stars
of
the
federated
states
in
the
collars
thereof
so
that
when
they
at
last
completed
and
put
on
these
shirts
they
may
be
said
to
have
hoisted
the
american
colors

consummate
masters
of

each
had
a
small
box
full
of
tools
and
colouring
matter
and
they
charged
so
high
for
their
services
that
at
the
end
of
the
cruise
they
were
supposed
to
have
cleared
upward
of
four
hundred
dollars
they

anything
else

might

at

the
crucifix
pricked
on
their
arms
and
for
this
reason
if
they
chanced
to
die
in
a
catholic
land
they
would
be
sure
of
a
decent
burial
in
consecrated
ground
as
the
priest
would
be
sure
to
observe

genial
loam

and
many
sailors
not

were
anxious
to
have

painted
on

to
a
curious
superstition
of
theirs

during

entire

having
an
endless

round

round

like
a
capstan
with
a
hawser
coiled
round
about
it
this
paid
eighteen
pence
per
link
for
the
cable
besides
being
on
the
smart
the
whole
cruise
suffering
the
effects
of
his
repeated
puncturings
so
he
paid
very
dear
for
his
cable
one
other
mode
of
passing
time
while
in
port
was
cleaning
and
polishing
your
for
it
must
be
known
that
in
every
sailor
has
some
brass
or
steel
of
one
kind
or
other
to
keep
in
high
housemaids
whose
business
it
is
to
keep
the
knobs
on
the
front
door
railing
and
the
excepting
the
and
scattered
about
the
decks
this
as
it
is
called
is
principally
about
the
guns
embracing
the
of
the
carronades
the
screws
little
irons
and
other
things
the
portion
that
fell
to
my
own
share
i
kept
in
superior
order
quite
equal
in
polish
to
best
cutlery
i
received
the
most
extravagant
encomiums
from
the
officers
one
of
whom
offered
to
match
me
against
any
brazier
or
in
her
british
navy
indeed
i
devoted
myself
to
the
work
body
and
soul
and
thought
no
pains
too
painful
and
no
labour
too
laborious
to
achieve
the
highest
attainable
polish
possible
for
us
poor
lost
sons
of
adam
to
reach
upon
one
occasion
even
when
woollen
rags
were
scarce
and
no
was
to
be
had
from
the
yeoman
i
sacrificed
the
corners
of
my
woollen
shirt
and
used
some
dentrifice
i
had
as
substitutes
for
the
rags
and
the
dentrifice
operated
delightfully
and
made
the
threading
of
my
carronade
screw
shine
and
grin
again
like
a
set
of
false
teeth
in
an
eager
mouth
still
another
mode
of
passing
time
was
arraying
yourself
in
your
best
and
promenading
up
and
down
the
admiring
the
shore
scenery
from
the
which
in
an
amphitheatrical
bay
like
about
by
the
most
varied
and
charming
scenery
of
hill
dale
moss
meadow
court
castle
tower
grove
vine
vineyard
aqueduct
palace
square
island
very
much
like
lounging
round
a
circular
cosmorama
and
ever
and
anon
lazily
peeping
through
the
glasses
here
and
there
oh
there
is
something
worth
living
for
even
in
our
world
and
one
glimpse
of
a
bower
of
grapes
though
a
length
off
is
almost
satisfaction
for
dining
off
a
salted
down
this
promenading
was
chiefly
patronised
by
the
marines
and
particularly
by
colbrook
a
remarkably
handsome
and
very
gentlemanly
corporal
among
them
he
was
a
complete
man
with
fine
black
eyes
bright
red
cheeks
glossy
jet
whiskers
and
a
refined
organisation
of
the
whole
man
he
used
to
array
himself
in
his
regimentals
and
saunter
about
like
an
officer
of
the
coldstream
guards
strolling
down
to
his
club
in
every
time
he
passed
me
he
would
heave
a
sentimental
sigh
and
hum
to
himself
girl
i
left
behind
this
fine
corporal
afterward
became
a
representative
in
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
i
saw
his
name
returned
about
a
year
after
my
return
home
but
after
all
there
was
not
much
room
while
in
port
for
promenading
at
least
on
the
for
the
whole
larboard
side
is
kept
clear
for
the
benefit
of
the
officers
who
appreciate
the
advantages
of
having
a
clear
stroll
fore
and
aft
and
they
well
know
that
the
sailors
had
much
better
be
crowded
together
on
the
other
side
than
that
the
set
of
their
own
should
be
impaired
by
brushing
against
their
tarry
trowsers
one
other
way
of
killing
time
while
in
port
is
playing
checkers
that
is
when
it
is
permitted
for
it
is
not
every
navy
captain
who
will
allow
such
a
scandalous
proceeding
but
as
for
captain
claret
though
he
like
his
glass
of
madeira
uncommonly
well
and
was
an
undoubted
descendant
from
the
hero
of
the
battle
of
the
brandywine
and
though
he
sometimes
showed
a
suspiciously
flushed
face
when
superintending
in
person
the
flogging
of
a
sailor
for
getting
intoxicated
against
his
particular
orders
yet
i
will
say
for
captain
claret
that
upon
the
whole
he
was
rather
indulgent
to
his
crew
so
long
as
they
were
perfectly
docile
he
allowed
them
to
play
checkers
as
much
as
they
pleased
more
than
once
i
have
known
him
when
going
forward
to
the
forecastle
pick
his
way
carefully
among
scores
of
canvas
spread
upon
the
deck
so
as
not
to
tread
upon
the
and
included
but
in
a
certain
sense
they
were
both
one
for
as
the
sailors
used
their
so
at
quarters
their
officers
used
these
men
but
captain
leniency
in
permitting
checkers
on
board
his
ship
might
have
arisen
from
the
following
little
circumstance
confidentially
communicated
to
me
soon
after
the
ship
had
sailed
from
home
checkers
were
prohibited
whereupon
the
sailors
were
exasperated
against
the
captain
and
one
night
when
he
was
walking
round
the
forecastle
bim
came
an
iron
past
his
ears
and
while
he
was
dodging
that
bim
came
another
from
the
other
side
so
that
it
being
a
very
dark
night
and
nobody
to
be
seen
and
it
being
impossible
to
find
out
the
trespassers
he
thought
it
best
to
get
back
into
his
cabin
as
soon
as
possible
some
time
as
if
the
had
nothing
to
do
with
was
indirectly
rumoured
that
the
might
be
brought
out
again
a
philosophical
shipmate
that
captain
claret
was
a
man
of
a
ready
understanding
and
could
understand
a
hint
as
well
as
any
other
man
even
when
conveyed
by
several
pounds
of
iron
some
of
the
sailors
were
very
precise
about
their
and
even
went
so
far
that
they
would
not
let
you
play
with
them
unless
you
first
washed
your
hands
especially
if
so
be
you
had
just
come
from
tarring
down
the
rigging
another
way
of
beguiling
the
tedious
hours
is
to
get
a
cosy
seat
somewhere
and
fall
into
as
snug
a
little
reverie
as
you
can
or
if
a
seat
is
not
to
be
is
frequently
the
get
a
tolerably
comfortable
against
the
bulwarks
and
begin
to
think
about
home
and
bread
and
inseparably
connected
to
a
will
very
soon
bring
delicious
tears
into
your
eyes
for
every
one
knows
what
a
luxury
is
grief
when
you
can
get
a
private
closet
to
enjoy
it
in
and
no
paul
prys
intrude
several
of
my
shore
friends
indeed
when
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
some
disaster
always
make
a
point
of
flying
to
the
first
and
shutting
themselves
up
in
a
box
with
nothing
but
a
plate
of
stewed
oysters
some
crackers
the
castor
and
a
decanter
of
old
port
still
another
way
of
killing
time
in
harbour
is
to
lean
over
the
bulwarks
and
speculate
upon
where
under
the
sun
you
are
going
to
be
that
day
next
year
which
is
a
subject
full
of
interest
to
every
living
soul
so
much
so
that
there
is
a
particular
day
of
a
particular
month
of
the
year
which
from
my
earliest
recollections
i
have
always
kept
the
run
of
so
that
i
can
even
now
tell
just
where
i
was
on
that
identical
day
of
every
year
past
since
i
was
twelve
years
old
and
when
i
am
all
alone
to
run
over
this
almanac
in
my
mind
is
almost
as
entertaining
as
to
read
your
own
diary
and
far
more
interesting
than
to
peruse
a
table
of
logarithms
on
a
rainy
afternoon
i
always
keep
the
anniversary
of
that
day
with
lamb
and
peas
and
a
pint
of
sherry
for
it
comes
in
spring
but
when
it
came
round
in
the
neversink
i
could
get
neither
lamb
peas
nor
sherry
but
perhaps
the
best
way
to
drive
the
hours
before
you
is
to
select
a
soft
plank
on
the
and
go
to
sleep
a
fine
specific
which
seldom
fails
unless
to
be
sure
you
have
been
sleeping
all
the
hours
beforehand
whenever
employed
in
killing
time
in
harbour
i
have
lifted
myself
up
on
my
elbow
and
looked
around
me
and
seen
so
many
of
my
shipmates
all
employed
at
the
same
common
business
all
under
lock
and
key
all
hopeless
prisoners
like
myself
all
under
martial
law
all
dieting
on
salt
beef
and
biscuit
all
in
one
uniform
all
yawning
gaping
and
stretching
in
concert
it
was
then
that
i
used
to
feel
a
certain
love
and
affection
for
them
grounded
doubtless
on
a
and
though
in
a
previous
part
of
this
narrative
i
have
mentioned
that
i
used
to
hold
myself
somewhat
aloof
from
the
mass
of
seamen
on
board
the
neversink
and
though
this
was
true
and
my
real
acquaintances
were
comparatively
few
and
my
intimates
still
fewer
yet
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
quite
impossible
to
live
so
long
with
five
hundred
of
your
even
if
not
of
the
best
families
in
the
land
and
with
morals
that
would
not
be
spoiled
by
further
cultivation
it
is
quite
impossible
i
say
to
live
with
five
hundred
of
your
be
they
who
they
may
without
feeling
a
common
sympathy
with
them
at
the
time
and
ever
after
cherishing
some
sort
of
interest
in
their
welfare
the
truth
of
this
was
curiously
corroborated
by
a
rather
equivocal
acquaintance
of
mine
who
among
the
men
went
by
the
name
of
he
belonged
to
the
whence
of
a
dark
night
he
would
sometimes
emerge
to
chat
with
the
sailors
on
deck
i
never
liked
the
looks
i
protest
it
was
a
mere
accident
that
gave
me
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
and
generally
i
did
my
best
to
avoid
him
when
he
would
come
skulking
like
a
out
of
his
den
into
the
liberal
open
air
of
the
sky
nevertheless
the
anecdote
this
told
me
is
well
worth
preserving
more
especially
the
extraordinary
frankness
evinced
in
his
narrating
such
a
thing
to
a
comparative
stranger
the
substance
of
his
story
was
as
follows
shakings
it
seems
had
once
been
a
convict
in
the
new
york
prison
at
sing
sing
where
he
had
been
for
years
confined
for
a
crime
which
he
gave
me
his
solemn
word
of
honour
he
was
wholly
innocent
of
he
told
me
that
after
his
term
had
expired
and
he
went
out
into
the
world
again
he
never
could
stumble
upon
any
of
his
old
sing
sing
associates
without
dropping
into
a
public
house
and
talking
over
old
times
and
when
fortune
would
go
hard
with
him
and
he
felt
out
of
sorts
and
incensed
at
matters
and
things
in
general
he
told
me
that
at
such
time
he
almost
wished
he
was
back
again
in
sing
sing
where
he
was
relieved
from
all
anxieties
about
what
he
should
eat
and
drink
and
was
supported
like
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
prince
albert
at
the
public
charge
he
used
to
have
such
a
snug
little
cell
he
said
all
to
himself
and
never
felt
afraid
of
for
the
walls
were
uncommonly
thick
and
his
door
was
securely
bolted
for
him
and
a
watchman
was
all
the
time
walking
up
and
down
in
the
passage
while
he
himself
was
fast
asleep
and
dreaming
to
this
in
substance
the
added
that
he
narrated
this
anecdote
because
he
thought
it
applicable
to
a
which
he
scandalously
asserted
to
be
a
sort
of
state
prison
afloat
concerning
the
curious
disposition
to
fraternise
and
be
sociable
which
this
shakings
mentioned
as
characteristic
of
the
convicts
liberated
from
his
old
homestead
at
sing
sing
it
may
well
be
asked
whether
it
may
not
prove
to
be
some
feeling
somehow
akin
to
the
reminiscent
impulses
which
influenced
them
that
shall
hereafter
fraternally
reunite
all
us
mortals
when
we
shall
have
exchanged
this
prison
world
of
ours
for
another
and
a
better
from
the
foregoing
account
of
the
great
difficulty
we
had
in
killing
time
while
in
port
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
on
board
of
the
neversink
in
rio
there
was
literally
no
work
to
be
done
at
long
intervals
the
would
come
alongside
with
to
be
emptied
into
iron
tanks
in
the
hold
in
this
way
nearly
fifty
thousand
gallons
as
chronicled
in
the
books
of
the
mate
were
decanted
into
the
ninety
allowance
with
this
huge
lake
ontario
in
us
the
mighty
neversink
might
be
said
to
resemble
the
united
continent
of
the
eastern
in
a
vast
ocean
herself
and
having
a
mediterranean
floating
in
her
chapter
xliii
smuggling
in
a
it
is
in
a
good
degree
owing
to
the
idleness
just
described
that
while
lying
in
harbour
the
is
exposed
to
the
most
temptations
and
gets
into
his
saddest
scrapes
for
though
his
vessel
be
anchored
a
mile
from
the
shore
and
her
sides
are
patrolled
by
sentries
night
and
day
yet
these
things
can
not
entirely
prevent
the
seductions
of
the
land
from
reaching
him
the
prime
agent
in
working
his
calamities
in
port
is
his
old
the
god
of
grog
immured
as
the
is
serving
out
his
weary
three
years
in
a
sort
of
from
which
he
can
not
escape
either
by
the
roof
or
burrowing
underground
he
too
often
flies
to
the
bottle
to
seek
relief
from
the
intolerable
ennui
of
nothing
to
do
and
nowhere
to
go
his
ordinary
government
allowance
of
spirits
one
gill
per
diem
is
not
enough
to
give
a
sufficient
to
his
listless
senses
he
pronounces
his
grog
basely
he
scouts
at
it
as
than
muslin
he
craves
a
more
vigorous
at
the
a
more
sturdy
at
the
halyards
and
if
opium
were
to
be
had
many
would
steep
themselves
a
thousand
fathoms
down
in
the
densest
fumes
of
that
oblivious
drug
tell
him
that
the
delirium
tremens
and
the
lie
in
ambush
for
drunkards
he
will
say
to
you
them
bear
down
upon
me
then
before
the
wind
anything
that
smacks
of
life
is
better
than
to
feel
davy
on
your
he
is
reckless
as
an
avalanche
and
though
his
fall
destroy
himself
and
others
yet
a
ruinous
commotion
is
better
than
being
frozen
fast
in
unendurable
solitudes
no
wonder
then
that
he
goes
all
lengths
to
procure
the
thing
he
craves
no
wonder
that
he
pays
the
most
exorbitant
prices
breaks
through
all
law
and
braves
the
ignominious
lash
itself
rather
than
be
deprived
of
his
stimulus
now
concerning
no
one
thing
in
a
are
the
regulations
more
severe
than
respecting
the
smuggling
of
grog
and
being
found
intoxicated
for
either
offence
there
is
but
one
penalty
invariably
enforced
and
that
is
the
degradation
of
the
gangway
all
conceivable
precautions
are
taken
by
most
to
guard
against
the
secret
admission
of
spirits
into
the
vessel
in
the
first
place
no
whatever
is
allowed
to
approach
a
in
a
foreign
harbour
without
permission
from
the
officer
of
the
deck
even
the
the
small
craft
licensed
by
the
officers
to
bring
off
fruit
for
the
sailors
to
be
bought
out
of
their
own
are
invariably
inspected
before
permitted
to
hold
intercourse
with
the
company
and
not
only
this
but
every
one
of
the
numerous
almost
continually
plying
to
and
from
the
similarly
inspected
sometimes
each
boat
twenty
times
in
the
day
this
inspection
is
thus
performed
the
boat
being
descried
by
the
from
the
poop
she
is
reported
to
the
deck
officer
who
thereupon
summons
the
the
chief
of
police
this
functionary
now
stations
himself
at
the
gangway
and
as
the
crew
one
by
one
come
up
the
side
he
personally
overhauls
them
making
them
take
off
their
hats
and
then
placing
both
hands
upon
their
heads
draws
his
palms
slowly
down
to
their
feet
carefully
feeling
all
unusual
protuberances
if
nothing
suspicious
is
felt
the
man
is
let
pass
and
so
on
till
the
whole
crew
averaging
about
sixteen
men
are
examined
the
chief
of
police
then
descends
into
the
boat
and
walks
from
stem
to
stern
eyeing
it
all
over
and
poking
his
long
rattan
into
every
nook
and
cranny
this
operation
concluded
and
nothing
found
he
mounts
the
ladder
touches
his
hat
to
the
and
reports
the
boat
whereupon
she
is
hauled
out
to
the
booms
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
not
a
man
of
the
company
ever
enters
the
vessel
from
shore
without
it
being
rendered
next
to
impossible
apparently
that
he
should
have
succeeded
in
smuggling
anything
those
individuals
who
are
permitted
to
board
the
ship
without
undergoing
this
ordeal
are
only
persons
whom
it
would
be
preposterous
to
as
the
commodore
himself
the
captain
lieutenants
and
gentlemen
and
ladies
coming
as
visitors
for
anything
to
be
clandestinely
thrust
through
the
lower
at
night
is
rendered
very
difficult
from
the
watchfulness
of
the
in
hailing
all
boats
that
approach
long
before
they
draw
alongside
and
the
vigilance
of
the
sentries
posted
on
platforms
overhanging
the
water
whose
orders
are
to
fire
into
a
strange
boat
which
after
being
warned
to
withdraw
should
still
persist
in
drawing
nigh
moreover
shots
are
slung
to
ropes
and
suspended
over
the
bows
to
drop
a
hole
into
and
sink
any
small
craft
which
spite
of
all
precautions
by
strategy
should
succeed
in
getting
under
the
bows
with
liquor
by
night
indeed
the
whole
power
of
martial
law
is
enlisted
in
this
matter
and
every
one
of
the
numerous
officers
of
the
ship
besides
his
general
zeal
in
enforcing
the
regulations
adds
to
that
a
personal
feeling
since
the
sobriety
of
the
men
abridges
his
own
cares
and
anxieties
how
then
it
will
be
asked
in
the
face
of
an
police
and
in
defiance
even
of
bayonets
and
bullets
do
contrive
to
smuggle
their
spirits
not
to
enlarge
upon
minor
few
days
detected
and
rendered
naught
such
as
rolling
up
in
a
handkerchief
a
long
slender
of
grog
like
a
sausage
and
in
that
manner
ascending
to
the
deck
out
of
a
boat
just
from
shore
or
openly
bringing
on
board
and
melons
procured
from
a
knavish
filled
with
spirits
instead
of
milk
or
water
will
only
mention
here
two
or
three
other
modes
coming
under
my
own
observation
while
in
rio
a
belonging
to
the
second
cutter
paid
down
the
money
and
made
an
arrangement
with
a
person
encountered
at
the
ashore
to
the
following
effect
of
a
certain
moonless
night
he
was
to
bring
off
three
gallons
of
spirits
and
moor
them
to
the
distance
from
the
something
heavy
to
sink
them
out
of
sight
in
the
middle
watch
of
the
night
the
slips
out
of
his
hammock
and
by
creeping
along
in
the
shadows
eludes
the
vigilance
of
the
and
his
mates
gains
a
and
softly
lowers
himself
into
the
water
almost
without
creating
a
sentries
marching
to
and
fro
on
their
overhanging
platform
above
him
he
is
an
expert
swimmer
and
paddles
along
under
the
surface
every
now
and
then
rising
a
little
and
lying
motionless
on
his
back
to
but
his
nose
exposed
the
buoy
gained
he
cuts
the
skins
adrift
ties
them
round
his
body
and
in
the
same
adroit
manner
makes
good
his
return
this
feat
is
very
seldom
attempted
for
it
needs
the
utmost
caution
address
and
dexterity
and
no
one
but
a
burglar
and
faultless
leander
of
a
swimmer
could
achieve
it
from
the
greater
privileges
which
they
enjoy
the
that
is
the
gunner
boatswain
have
much
greater
opportunities
for
successful
smuggling
than
the
common
seamen
coming
alongside
one
night
in
a
cutter
yarn
our
boatswain
in
some
inexplicable
way
contrived
to
slip
several
skins
of
brandy
through
the
of
his
own
the
feat
however
must
have
been
perceived
by
one
of
the
crew
who
immediately
on
gaining
the
deck
sprung
down
the
ladders
stole
into
the
room
and
made
away
with
the
prize
not
three
minutes
before
the
rightful
owner
entered
to
claim
it
though
from
certain
circumstances
the
thief
was
known
to
the
aggrieved
party
yet
the
latter
could
say
nothing
since
he
himself
had
infringed
the
law
but
the
next
day
in
the
capacity
of
captain
of
the
executioners
yarn
had
the
satisfaction
it
was
so
to
him
of
standing
over
the
robber
at
the
gangway
for
being
found
intoxicated
with
the
very
liquor
the
boatswain
himself
had
smuggled
the
man
had
been
condemned
to
a
flogging
this
recalls
another
instance
still
more
illustrative
of
the
knotted
trebly
intertwisted
villainy
accumulating
at
a
sort
of
compound
interest
in
a
the
cockswain
of
the
barge
takes
his
crew
apart
one
by
one
and
cautiously
sounds
them
as
to
their
to
the
united
states
of
america
but
to
himself
three
individuals
whom
he
deems
is
faithful
to
the
united
states
of
procures
to
be
discharged
from
the
barge
and
men
of
his
own
selection
are
substituted
for
he
is
always
an
influential
character
this
cockswain
of
the
barge
previous
to
this
however
he
has
seen
to
it
well
that
no
temperance
is
sailors
who
do
not
draw
their
government
ration
of
grog
but
take
the
money
for
has
seen
to
it
that
none
of
these
are
numbered
among
his
crew
having
now
proved
his
men
he
divulges
his
plan
to
the
assembled
body
a
solemn
oath
of
secrecy
is
obtained
and
he
waits
the
first
fit
opportunity
to
carry
into
execution
his
nefarious
designs
at
last
it
comes
one
afternoon
the
barge
carries
the
commodore
across
the
bay
to
a
fine
settlement
of
seats
called
praya
grande
the
commodore
is
visiting
a
portuguese
marquis
and
the
pair
linger
long
over
their
dinner
in
an
arbour
in
the
garden
meanwhile
the
cockswain
has
liberty
to
roam
about
where
he
pleases
he
searches
out
a
place
where
some
choice
brandy
is
to
be
had
purchases
six
large
bottles
and
conceals
them
among
the
trees
under
the
pretence
of
filling
the
with
water
which
is
always
kept
in
the
barge
to
refresh
the
crew
he
now
carries
it
off
into
the
grove
knocks
out
the
head
puts
the
bottles
inside
reheads
the
keg
fills
it
with
water
carries
it
down
to
the
boat
and
audaciously
restores
it
to
its
conspicuous
position
in
the
middle
with
its
up
when
the
commodore
comes
down
to
the
beach
and
they
pull
off
for
the
ship
the
cockswain
in
a
loud
voice
commands
the
nearest
man
to
take
that
bung
out
of
the
precious
water
will
spoil
arrived
alongside
the
frigate
the
crew
are
overhauled
as
usual
at
the
gangway
and
nothing
being
found
on
them
are
passed
the
now
descending
into
the
barge
and
finding
nothing
suspicious
reports
it
having
put
his
finger
into
the
open
bung
of
the
keg
and
tasted
that
the
water
was
pure
the
barge
is
ordered
out
to
the
booms
and
deep
night
is
waited
for
ere
the
cockswain
essays
to
snatch
the
bottles
from
the
keg
but
unfortunately
for
the
success
of
this
masterly
smuggler
one
of
his
crew
is
a
fellow
who
having
drank
somewhat
freely
ashore
goes
about
the
throwing
out
profound
tipsy
hints
concerning
some
unutterable
proceeding
on
the
anvil
a
knowing
old
an
unprincipled
fellow
putting
this
that
and
the
other
together
ferrets
out
the
mystery
and
straightway
resolves
to
reap
the
goodly
harvest
which
the
cockswain
has
sowed
he
seeks
him
out
takes
him
to
one
side
and
addresses
him
thus
you
have
been
smuggling
off
some
which
at
this
moment
is
in
your
barge
at
the
booms
now
cockswain
i
have
stationed
two
of
my
at
the
on
that
side
of
the
ship
and
if
they
report
to
me
that
you
or
any
of
your
bargemen
offer
to
enter
that
barge
before
morning
i
will
immediately
report
you
as
a
smuggler
to
the
officer
of
the
the
cockswain
is
astounded
for
to
be
reported
to
the
as
a
smuggler
would
inevitably
procure
him
a
sound
flogging
and
be
the
disgraceful
of
him
as
a
petty
officer
receiving
four
dollars
a
month
beyond
his
pay
as
an
able
seaman
he
attempts
to
bribe
the
other
to
secrecy
by
promising
half
the
profits
of
the
enterprise
but
the
integrity
is
like
a
rock
he
is
no
mercenary
to
be
bought
up
for
a
song
the
cockswain
therefore
is
forced
to
swear
that
neither
himself
nor
any
of
his
crew
shall
enter
the
barge
before
morning
this
done
the
goes
to
his
confidants
and
arranges
his
plans
in
a
word
he
succeeds
in
introducing
the
six
brandy
bottles
into
the
ship
five
of
which
he
sells
at
eight
dollars
a
bottle
and
then
with
the
sixth
between
two
guns
he
secretly
regales
himself
and
confederates
while
the
helpless
cockswain
stifling
his
rage
bitterly
eyes
them
from
afar
thus
though
they
say
that
there
is
honour
among
thieves
there
is
little
among
smugglers

story
now
about

occurred
while
we
lay
in
rio
it
is
the
more
particularly
presented
since
it
furnishes
the
most
curious
evidence
of
the
almost
incredible
corruption
pervading
nearly
all
ranks
in
some
for
some
days
the
number
of
intoxicated
sailors
collared
and
brought
up
to
the
mast
by
the
to
be
reported
to
the
to
a
flogging
at
the
in
the
last
degree
excited
the
surprise
and
vexation
of
the
captain
and
senior
officers
so
strict
were
the
regulations
concerning
the
suppression
of
and
so
particular
had
he
been
in
charging
the
matter
upon
all
the
lieutenants
and
every
understrapper
official
in
the
frigate
that
he
was
wholly
at
a
loss
how
so
large
a
quantity
of
spirits
could
have
been
spirited
into
the
ship
in
the
face
of
all
these
checks
guards
and
precautions
still
additional
steps
were
adopted
to
detect
the
smugglers
and
bland
the
together
with
his
corporals
were
publicly
harangued
at
the
mast
by
the
captain
in
person
and
charged
to
exert
their
best
powers
in
suppressing
the
traffic
crowds
were
present
at
the
time
and
saw
the
touch
his
cap
in
obsequious
homage
as
he
solemnly
assured
the
captain
that
he
would
still
continue
to
do
his
best
as
indeed
he
said
he
had
always
done
he
concluded
with
a
pious
ejaculation
expressive
of
his
personal
abhorrence
of
smuggling
and
drunkenness
and
his
fixed
resolution
so
help
him
heaven
to
spend
his
last
wink
in
sitting
up
by
night
to
spy
out
all
deeds
of
darkness
do
not

you
returned
the

go
to
your
this
was
a
favourite
of
the
the
next
morning
before
breakfast
when
the
came
off
that
is
one
of
the
boats
regularly
deputed
to
bring
off
the
daily
fresh
provisions
for
the
officers
this
boat
came
off
the
as
usual
after
carefully
examining
both
her
and
her
crew
reported
them
to
the
to
be
free
from
suspicion
the
provisions
were
then
hoisted
out
and
among
them
came
a
wooden
box
addressed
to
purser
of
the
united
states
ship
of
course
any
private
matter
of
this
sort
destined
for
a
gentleman
of

sacred
from

and
the
commanded
one
of
his
corporals
to
carry
it
down
into
the
but
recent
occurrences
had
sharpened
the
vigilance
of
the
to
an
unwonted
degree
and
seeing
the
box
going
down
the
hatchway
he
demanded
what
that
was
and
whom
it
was
for
right
sir
said
the
touching
his
cap
for
the
purser
it
remain
on
deck
said
the
lieutenant
montgomery
calling
a
midshipman
the
purser
whether
there
is
any
box
coming
off
for
him
this
ay
sir
said
the
middy
touching
his
cap
presently
he
returned
saying
that
the
purser
was
ashore
good
then
montgomery
have
that
box
put
into
the
with
strict
orders
to
the
sentry
not
to
suffer
any
one
to
touch
i
not
better
take
it
down
into
my
mess
sir
till
the
purser
comes
off
said
the
deferentially
have
given
my
orders
sir
said
the
lieutenant
turning
away
when
the
purser
came
on
board
it
turned
out
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
about
the
box
he
had
never
so
much
as
heard
of
it
in
his
life
so
it
was
again
brought
up
before
the
who
immediately
summoned
the
open
that
box
sir
said
the
and
wrenching
off
the
cover
brown
jugs
like
a
litter
of
brown
pigs
were
found
snugly
nestled
in
a
bed
of
straw
smugglers
are
at
work
sir
said
the
looking
up
and
taste
it
said
the
officer
the
did
so
and
smacking
his
lips
after
a
puzzled
fashion
was
a
little
doubtful
whether
it
was
american
whisky
or
holland
gin
but
he
said
he
was
not
used
to
liquor
i
know
it
by
the
smell
said
the
officer
the
box
to
the
ay
sir
said
the
redoubling
his
activity
the
affair
was
at
once
reported
to
the
captain
who
incensed
at
the
audacity
of
the
thing
adopted
every
plan
to
detect
the
guilty
parties
inquiries
were
made
ashore
but
by
whom
the
box
had
been
brought
down
to
the
there
was
no
finding
out
here
the
matter
rested
for
a
time
some
days
after
one
of
the
boys
of
the
was
flogged
for
drunkenness
and
while
suspended
in
agony
at
the
gratings
was
made
to
reveal
from
whom
he
had
procured
his
spirits
the
man
was
called
and
turned
out
to
be
an
old
superannuated
marine
one
scriggs
who
did
the
cooking
for
the
and
mess
this
marine
was
one
of
the
most
fellows
in
the
ship
with
a
squinting
gray
eye
and
gallows
gait
how
such
a
most
unmartial
vagabond
had
insinuated
himself
into
the
honourable
marine
corps
was
a
perfect
mystery
he
had
always
been
noted
for
his
personal
uncleanliness
and
among
all
hands
fore
and
aft
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
notorious
old
miser
who
denied
himself
the
few
comforts
and
many
of
the
common
necessaries
of
a
life
seeing
no
escape
scriggs
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
captain
and
confessed
the
charge
of
the
boy
observing
the
fellow
to
be
in
an
agony
of
fear
at
the
sight
of
the
mates
and
their
lashes
and
all
the
striking
parade
of
public
punishment
the
captain
must
have
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
for
completely
pumping
him
of
all
his
secrets
this
terrified
marine
was
at
length
forced
to
reveal
his
having
been
for
some
time
an
accomplice
in
a
complicated
system
of
underhand
villainy
the
head
of
which
was
no
less
a
personage
than
the
indefatigable
chief
of
police
the
himself
it
appeared
that
this
official
had
his
confidential
agents
ashore
who
supplied
him
with
spirits
and
in
various
boxes
packages
and
to
the
purser
and
them
down
to
the
boats
at
the
landing
ordinarily
the
appearance
of
these
things
for
the
purser
and
other
gentlemen
occasioned
no
surprise
for
almost
every
day
some
bundle
or
other
is
coming
off
for
them
especially
for
the
purser
and
as
the
was
always
present
on
these
occasions
it
was
an
easy
matter
for
him
to
hurry
the
smuggled
liquor
out
of
sight
and
under
pretence
of
carrying
the
box
or
bundle
down
to
the
room
hide
it
away
upon
his
own
premises
the
miserly
marine
scriggs
with
the
eye
was
the
man
who
clandestinely
sold
the
spirits
to
the
sailors
thus
completely
keeping
the
in
the
background
the
liquor
sold
at
the
most
exorbitant
prices
at
one
time
reaching
twelve
dollars
the
bottle
in
cash
and
thirty
dollars
a
bottle
in
orders
upon
the
purser
to
be
honored
upon
the
arrival
home
it
may
seem
incredible
that
such
prices
should
have
been
given
by
the
sailors
but
when
some
crave
liquor
and
it
is
hard
to
procure
they
would
almost
barter
ten
years
of
their
for
but
one
solitary
if
they
could
the
sailors
who
became
intoxicated
with
the
liquor
thus
smuggled
on
board
by
the
were
in
almost
numberless
instances
officially
seized
by
that
functionary
and
scourged
at
the
gangway
in
a
previous
place
it
has
been
shown
how
conspicuous
a
part
the
enacts
at
this
scene
the
ample
profits
of
this
iniquitous
business
were
divided
between
all
the
parties
concerned
in
it
scriggs
the

coming
in
for

four
canvas
bags
of
silver
were
found
in
it
amounting
to
a
sum
something
short
of

many
hundred
dollars
the
guilty
parties
were
scourged
and
for
several
weeks
were
confined
in

under

time

at

disgracing
him
still
more
was
thrust
into
the
the
most
inglorious
division
of
the
ship
upon
going
to
dinner
one
day
i
found
him
soberly
seated
at
my
own
mess
and
at
first
i
could
not
but
feel
some
very
serious
scruples
about
dining
with
him
nevertheless
he
was
a
man
to
study
and
digest
so
upon
a
little
reflection
i
was
not
displeased
at
his
presence
it
amazed
me
however
that
he
had
wormed
himself
into
the
mess
since
so
many
of
the
other
messes
had
declined
the
honour
until
at
last
i
ascertained
that
he
had
induced
a
of
ours
a
distant
relation
of
his
to
prevail
upon
the
cook
to
admit
him
now
it
would
not
have
answered
for
hardly
any
other
mess
in
the
ship
to
have
received
this
man
among
them
for
it
would
have
torn
a
huge
rent
in
their
reputation
but
our
mess
a
no
composed
of
so
fine
a
set
of
fellows
so
many
captains
of
tops
and
of
undeniable
mark
on
board
standing
and
consideration
on
the
that
with
impunity
we
could
do
so
many
equivocal
things
utterly
inadmissible
for
messes
of
inferior
pretension
besides
though
we
all
abhorred
the
monster
of
sin
itself
yet
from
our
social
superiority
highly
rarified
education
in
our
lofty
top
and
large
and
liberal
sweep
of
the
aggregate
of
things
we
were
in
a
good
degree
free
from
those
useless
personal
prejudices
and
galling
hatreds
against
conspicuous
not
so
widely
prevail
among
men
of
warped
understandings
and
unchristian
and
uncharitable
hearts
no
the
superstitions
and
dogmas
concerning
sin
had
not
laid
their
withering
maxims
upon
our
hearts
we
perceived
how
that
evil
was
but
good
disguised
and
a
knave
a
saint
in
his
way
how
that
in
other
planets
perhaps
what
we
deem
wrong
may
there
be
deemed
right
even
as
some
substances
without
undergoing
any
mutations
in
themselves
utterly
change
their
colour
according
to
the
light
thrown
upon
them
we
perceived
that
the
anticipated
millennium
must
have
begun
upon
the
morning
the
first
words
were
created
and
that
taken
all
in
all
our
world
itself
was
as
eligible
a
craft
as
any
to
be
found
in
the
milky
way
and
we
fancied
that
though
some
of
us
of
the
were
at
times
condemned
to
sufferings
and
blights
and
all
manner
of
tribulation
and
anguish
yet
no
doubt
it
was
only
our
misapprehension
of
these
things
that
made
us
take
them
for
woeful
pains
instead
of
the
most
agreeable
pleasures
i
have
dreamed
of
a
sphere
says
pinzella
where
to
break
a
man
on
the
wheel
is
held
the
most
exquisite
of
delights
you
can
confer
upon
him
where
for
one
gentleman
in
any
way
to
vanquish
another
is
accounted
an
everlasting
dishonour
where
to
tumble
one
into
a
pit
after
death
and
then
throw
cold
clods
upon
his
upturned
face
is
a
species
of
contumely
only
inflicted
upon
the
most
notorious
criminals
but
whatever
we
thought
in
whatever
circumstances
we
found
ourselves
we
never
forgot
that
our
frigate
had
as
it
was
was
such
at
least
were
our
reveries
at
times
though
sorely
jarred
now
and
then
by
events
that
took
our
philosophy
aback
for
after
all
is
the
best
wisdom
that
has
ever
in
any
way
been
revealed
to
our
but
a
slough
and
a
mire
with
a
few
tufts
of
good
footing
here
and
there
but
there
was
one
man
in
the
mess
who
would
have
naught
to
do
with
our
churlish
unphilosophical
superstitious
old
bear
of
a
a
believer
in
tophet
for
which
he
was
accordingly
preparing
himself
priming
was
his
name
but
methinks
i
have
spoken
of
him
before
besides
this
bland
the
was
no
vulgar
dirty
knave
in
modify
but
only
seemed
to
lose
half
its
seeming
evil
by
losing
all
its
apparent
grossness
he
was
a
neat
and
gentlemanly
villain
and
broke
his
biscuit
with
a
dainty
hand
there
was
a
fine
polish
about
his
whole
person
and
a
pliant
insinuating
style
in
his
conversation
that
was
socially
quite
irresistible
save
my
noble
captain
jack
chase
he
proved
himself
the
most
entertaining
i
had
almost
said
the
most
companionable
man
in
the
mess
nothing
but
his
mouth
that
was
somewhat
small
and
wickedly
delicate
and
his
snaky
black
eye
that
at
times
shone
like
a
in
a
at
midnight
betokened
the
accomplished
scoundrel
within
but
in
his
conversation
there
was
no
trace
of
evil
nothing
equivocal
he
studiously
shunned
an
indelicacy
never
swore
and
chiefly
abounded
in
passing
puns
and
witticisms
varied
with
humorous
contrasts
between
ship
and
shore
life
and
many
agreeable
and
racy
anecdotes
very
tastefully
narrated
in
a
merely
psychological
point
of
view
at
was
a
charming
blackleg
ashore
such
a
man
might
have
been
an
irreproachable
mercantile
swindler
circulating
in
polite
society
but
he
was
still
more
than
this
indeed
i
claim
for
this
a
lofty
and
honourable
niche
in
the
newgate
calendar
of
history
his
intrepidity
coolness
and
wonderful
in
calmly
resigning
himself
to
a
fate
that
thrust
him
from
an
office
in
which
he
had
tyrannised
over
five
hundred
mortals
many
of
whom
hated
and
loathed
him
passed
all
belief
his
intrepidity
i
say
in
now
fearlessly
gliding
among
them
like
a
disarmed
swordfish
among
ferocious
this
surely
bespoke
no
ordinary
man
while
in
office
even
his
life
had
often
been
secretly
attempted
by
the
seamen
whom
he
had
brought
to
the
gangway
of
dark
nights
they
had
dropped
shot
down
the
hatchways
destined
damage
his
as
they
phrased
it
they
had
made
ropes
with
a
noose
at
the
end
and
tried
to
him
in
dark
corners
and
now
he
was
adrift
among
them
under
notorious
circumstances
of
superlative
villainy
at
last
dragged
to
light
and
yet
he
blandly
smiled
politely
offered
his
to
a
perfect
stranger
and
laughed
and
chatted
to
right
and
left
as
if
springy
buoyant
and
elastic
with
an
angelic
conscience
and
sure
of
kind
friends
wherever
he
went
both
in
this
life
and
the
life
to
come
while
he
was
lying
ironed
in
the
gangs
of
the
men
were
sometimes
overheard
whispering
about
the
terrible
reception
they
would
give
him
when
he
should
be
set
at
large
nevertheless
when
liberated
they
seemed
confounded
by
his
erect
and
cordial
assurance
his
gentlemanly
sociability
and
fearless
companionableness
from
being
an
implacable
policeman
vigilant
cruel
and
remorseless
in
his
office
however
polished
in
his
phrases
he
was
now
become
a
disinterested
sauntering
man
of
leisure
winking
at
all
improprieties
and
ready
to
laugh
and
make
merry
with
any
one
still
at
first
the
men
gave
him
a
wide
berth
and
returned
scowls
for
his
smiles
but
who
can
forever
resist
the
very
devil
himself
when
he
comes
in
the
guise
of
a
gentleman
free
fine
and
frank
though
pious
margaret
hates
the
devil
in
his
horns
and
tail
yet
she
smiles
and
nods
to
the
engaging
fiend
in
the
persuasive
oily
wholly
harmless
mephistopheles
but
however
it
was
i
for
one
regarded
this
with
mixed
feelings
of
detestation
pity
admiration
and
something
opposed
to
enmity
i
could
not
but
abominate
him
when
i
thought
of
his
conduct
but
i
pitied
the
continual
gnawing
which
under
all
his
disguises
i
saw
lying
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
i
admired
his
heroism
in
sustaining
himself
so
well
under
such
reverses
and
when
i
thought
how
arbitrary
the
of
are
in
defining
a
villain
how
much
undetected
guilt
might
be
sheltered
by
the
aristocratic
awning
of
our
how
many
florid
pursers
ornaments
of
the
had
been
legally
protected
in
defrauding
i
could
not
but
say
to
myself
well
after
all
though
this
man
is
a
most
wicked
one
indeed
yet
is
he
even
more
luckless
than
depraved
besides
a
studied
observation
of
bland
convinced
me
that
he
was
an
organic
and
irreclaimable
scoundrel
who
did
wicked
deeds
as
the
cattle
browse
the
herbage
because
wicked
deeds
seemed
the
legitimate
operation
of
his
whole
infernal
organisation
phrenologically
he
was
without
a
soul
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
devils
are
irreligious
what
then
thought
i
who
is
to
blame
in
this
matter
for
one
i
will
not
take
the
day
of
judgment
upon
me
by
authoritatively
pronouncing
upon
the
essential
criminality
of
any
and
christianity
has
taught
me
that
at
the
last
day
will
not
be
judged
by
the
of
nor
by
the
states
statutes
at
but
by
immutable
laws
ineffably
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
honourable
board
of
commodores
and
navy
commissioners
but
though
i
will
stand
by
even
a
thief
and
defend
him
from
being
seized
up
at
the
gangway
if
i
that
my
saviour
once
hung
between
two
thieves
promising
one
i
would
not
after
the
plain
conviction
of
a
villain
again
let
him
entirely
loose
to
prey
upon
honest
seamen
fore
and
aft
all
three
decks
but
this
did
captain
claret
and
though
the
thing
may
not
perhaps
be
credited
nevertheless
here
it
shall
be
recorded
after
the
had
been
adrift
among
the
company
for
several
weeks
and
we
were
within
a
few
sail
of
home
he
was
summoned
to
the
mast
and
publicly
reinstated
in
his
office
as
the
chief
of
police
perhaps
captain
claret
had
read
the
memoirs
of
vidocq
and
believed
in
the
old
saying
a
rogue
to
catch
a
or
perhaps
he
was
a
man
of
very
tender
feelings
highly
susceptible
to
the
soft
emotions
of
gratitude
and
could
not
bear
to
leave
in
disgrace
a
person
who
out
of
the
generosity
of
his
heart
had
about
a
year
previous
presented
him
with
a
rare
fabricated
from
a
tooth
with
a
curious
silver
hinge
and
cunningly
wrought
in
the
shape
of
a
whale
also
a
splendid
cane
of
a
costly
brazilian
wood
with
a
gold
plate
bearing
the
name
and
rank
in
the
service
the
place
and
time
of
his
birth
and
with
a
vacancy
doubt
providentially
left
for
his
heirs
to
record
his
decease
certain
it
was
that
some
months
previous
to
the
disgrace
he
had
presented
these
articles
to
the
captain
with
his
best
love
and
compliments
and
the
captain
had
received
them
and
seldom
went
ashore
without
the
cane
and
never
took
snuff
but
out
of
that
box
with
some
captains
a
sense
of
propriety
might
have
induced
them
to
return
these
presents
when
the
generous
donor
had
proved
himself
unworthy
of
having
them
retained
but
it
was
not
captain
claret
who
would
inflict
such
a
cutting
wound
upon
any
sensibilities
though
naval
customs
had
habituated
him
to
scourging
upon
an
emergency
now
had
captain
claret
deemed
himself
constitutionally
bound
to
decline
all
presents
from
his
subordinates
the
sense
of
gratitude
would
not
have
operated
to
the
prejudice
of
justice
and
as
some
of
the
subordinates
of
a
captain
are
apt
to
invoke
his
good
wishes
and
mollify
his
conscience
by
making
him
friendly
gifts
it
would
perhaps
been
an
excellent
thing
for
him
to
adopt
the
plan
pursued
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
when
he
received
a
present
of
lions
and
arabian
chargers
from
the
sultan
of
muscat
being
forbidden
by
his
sovereign
lords
and
masters
the
imperial
people
to
accept
of
any
gifts
from
foreign
powers
the
president
sent
them
to
an
auctioneer
and
the
proceeds
were
deposited
in
the
treasury
in
the
same
manner
when
captain
claret
received
his
and
cane
he
might
have
accepted
them
very
kindly
and
then
sold
them
off
to
the
highest
bidder
perhaps
to
the
donor
himself
who
in
that
case
would
never
have
tempted
him
again
upon
his
return
home
bland
was
paid
off
for
his
full
term
not
deducting
the
period
of
his
suspension
he
again
entered
the
service
in
his
old
capacity
as
no
further
allusion
will
be
made
to
this
affair
it
may
as
well
be
stated
now
that
for
the
very
brief
period
elapsing
between
his
restoration
and
being
paid
off
in
port
by
the
purser
the
conducted
himself
with
infinite
discretion
artfully
steering
between
any
relaxation
of
would
have
awakened
the
displeasure
of
the
any
unwise
would
have
revived
in
tenfold
force
all
the
old
grudges
of
the
seamen
under
his
command
never
did
he
show
so
much
talent
and
tact
as
when
vibrating
in
this
his
most
delicate
predicament
and
plenty
of
cause
was
there
for
the
exercise
of
his
cunningest
abilities
for
upon
the
discharge
of
our
at
home
should
he
be
held
by
them
as
an
enemy
as
free
and
independent
citizens
they
would
waylay
him
in
the
public
streets
and
take
purple
vengeance
for
all
his
iniquities
past
present
and
possible
in
the
future
more
than
once

been
seized
by

by

exasperated

though
under
extreme
provocation

guilty
of
the
maddest
vengeance

at

they
are
very
placable
and
even
to
those
who
may
have
outrageously
abused
them
many
things
in
point
might
be
related
but
i
forbear
this
account
of
the
can
not
better
be
concluded
than
by
denominating
him
in
the
vivid
language
of
the
captain

these
tompions
slip
in

out
very
handily
like

by
advice
of
a
friend
lemsford
alarmed
for
the
fate
of
his
box
of

had
latterly
made
use
of
a
particular
gun

he
thrust

partly
out

rolled

lemsford

just
as

no

then
a
part
of
the
people
just
as
you
are
aboard
the
frigate
here
the
public
is
one
thing
jack
and
the
people
are
right
said
jack
as
this
leg
virgil
you
are
a
trump
you
are
a
jewel
my
boy
the
public
and
the
people
ay
ay
my
lads
let
us
hate
the
one
and
cleave
to
the
chapter
xlvi
the
commodore
on
the
poop
and
one
of
under
the
hands
of
the
surgeon
a
day
or
two
after
the
publication
of
of
the
sirens
a
sad
accident
befell
a
of
mine
one
of
the
captains
of
the
he
was
a
fine
little
scot
who
from
the
premature
loss
of
the
hair
on
the
top
of
his
head
always
went
by
the
name
of
this
baldness
was
no
doubt
in
great
part
attributable
to
the
same
cause
that
early
thins
the
locks
of
most
the
hard
unyielding
and
ponderous
and
tarpaulin
hat
which
when
new
is
stiff
enough
to
sit
upon
and
indeed
in
lieu
of
his
thumb
sometimes
serves
the
common
sailor
for
a
bench
now
there
is
nothing
upon
which
the
commodore
of
a
squadron
more
prides
himself
than
upon
the
celerity
with
which
his
men
can
handle
the
sails
and
go
through
with
all
the
evolutions
pertaining
thereto
this
is
especially
manifested
in
harbour
when
other
vessels
of
his
squadron
are
near
and
perhaps
the
armed
ships
of
rival
nations
upon
these
occasions
surrounded
by
his
of
whom
in
his
own
floating
island
is
commodore
domineers
over
of
the
whole
oaken
archipelago
yea
magisterial
and
magnificent
as
the
sultan
of
the
isles
of
sooloo
but
even
as
so
potent
an
emperor
and
caesar
to
boot
as
the
great
don
of
germany
charles
the
fifth
was
used
to
divert
himself
in
his
dotage
by
watching
the
gyrations
of
the
springs
and
cogs
of
a
long
row
of
clocks
even
so
does
an
elderly
commodore
while
away
his
leisure
in
harbour
by
what
is
called
and
also
yards
and
sails
causing
the
various
spars
of
all
the
ships
under
his
command
to
be
and
in
concert
while
the
commodore
himself
sits
something
like
king
canute
on
an
on
the
poop
of
his
but
far
more
regal
than
any
descendant
of
charlemagne
more
haughty
than
any
mogul
of
the
east
and
almost
mysterious
and
voiceless
in
his
authority
as
the
great
spirit
of
the
five
nations
the
commodore
deigns
not
to
verbalise
his
commands
they
are
imparted
by
signal
and
as
for
old
charles
the
fifth
again
the
coloured
suits
of
cards
were
invented
to
while
away
his
dotage
even
so
doubtless
must
these
pretty
little
signals
of
blue
and
red
spotted
have
been
devised
to
cheer
the
old
age
of
all
commodores
by
the
side
stands
the
with
a
bag
swung
on
his
shoulder
as
a
sportsman
bears
his
the
in
one
hand
and
the
signal
in
the
other
as
this
contains
the
masonic
signs
and
tokens
of
the
navy
and
would
therefore
be
invaluable
to
an
enemy
its
binding
is
always
bordered
with
lead
so
as
to
insure
its
sinking
in
case
the
ship
should
be
captured
not
the
only
book
this
that
might
appropriately
be
bound
in
lead
though
there
be
many
where
the
author
and
not
the
bookbinder
furnishes
the
metal
as
understands
it
these
signals
consist
of
flags
each
standing
for
a
certain
number
say
there
are
ten
flags
representing
the
cardinal
red
flag
no
the
blue
flag
no
the
green
flag
no
and
so
forth
then
by
mounting
the
blue
flag
over
the
red
that
would
stand
for
no
if
the
green
flag
were
set
underneath
it
would
then
stand
for
how
easy
then
by
endless
transpositions
to
multiply
the
various
numbers
that
may
be
exhibited
at
the
even
by
only
three
or
four
of
these
flags
to
each
number
a
particular
meaning
is
applied
no
for
instance
may
mean
to
no
hands
to
no
no
anything
to
windward
no
and
as
every
is
furnished
with
a
where
all
these
things
are
set
down
in
order
therefore
though
two
american
perfect
strangers
to
each
from
the
opposite
poles
yet
at
a
distance
of
more
than
a
mile
they
could
carry
on
a
very
liberal
conversation
in
the
air
when
several
of
one
nation
lie
at
anchor
in
one
port
forming
a
wide
circle
round
their
lord
and
master
the
it
is
a
very
interesting
sight
to
see
them
all
obeying
the
orders
who
meanwhile
never
opens
his
lips
thus
was
it
with
us
in
rio
and
hereby
hangs
the
story
of
my
poor
messmate
bally
one
morning
in
obedience
to
a
signal
from
our
the
various
vessels
belonging
to
the
american
squadron
then
in
harbour
simultaneously
loosened
their
sails
to
dry
in
the
evening
the
signal
was
set
to
furl
them
upon
such
occasions
great
rivalry
exists
between
the
first
lieutenants
of
the
different
ships
they
vie
with
each
other
who
shall
first
have
his
sails
stowed
on
the
yards
and
this
rivalry
is
shared
between
all
the
officers
of
each
vessel
who
are
respectively
placed
over
the
different
so
that
the
is
all
eagerness
to
vanquish
the
and
the
to
vanquish
them
both
stimulated
by
the
shouts
of
their
officers
the
sailors
throughout
the
squadron
exert
themselves
to
the
utmost
topmen
lay
out
furl
cried
the
first
lieutenant
of
the
neversink
at
the
word
the
men
sprang
into
the
rigging
and
on
all
three
masts
were
soon
climbing
about
the
yards
in
reckless
haste
to
execute
their
orders
now
in
furling
or
courses
the
point
of
honour
and
the
hardest
work
is
in
the
or
middle
of
the
yard
this
post
belongs
to
the
first
captain
of
the
top
are
you
there
roared
the
first
lieutenant
through
his
trumpet
you
you
are
clumsy
as

off

in

was
being

with
frantically
exerting
himself
piling
up

ponderous

jumped
with
both
feet
into
the

to
the

in
that
manner
was
violently
treading
down
the
canvas
to
pack
it
close

the

lieutenant
baldy
brought
his
whole

in
his
frenzied
heedlessness
let
go
his
hold
on
the
baldy
are
you
afraid
of
falling
cried
the
first
lieutenant
at
that
moment
with
all
his
force
baldy
jumped
down
upon
the
sail
the
parted
and
a
dark
form
dropped
through
the
air
lighting
upon
the
it
rolled
off
and
the
next
instant
with
a
horrid
crash
of
all
his
bones
baldy
came
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
the
deck
aboard

is
a
stout
oaken
platform
about
four
feet
square
on

side
of

by
three
or
four
steps
on

it
is
railed
in
at
the
sides
with
horizontal
brass
bars
it
is
called

there
the
officer
of
the

usually
stands
in
giving
his
orders

it

fell

across

bending
them
into

crushing

and
all
right
down
to
the
deck
in
a
thousand
splinters
he
was
picked
up
for
dead
and
carried
below
to
the
surgeon
his
bones
seemed
like
those
of
a
man
broken
on
the
wheel
and
no
one
thought
he
would
survive
the
night
but
with
the
skillful

all

stretched

baldy
lay
flat
on
the
floor
of

many
weeks
upon
our
arrival
home
he
was
able
to
hobble
ashore
on

but
from
a
hale

man
with
bronzed
cheeks
he
was
become
a

ere

from

of

near

buried

in

chapter
xlvii
an
auction
in
a
some
allusion
has
been
made
to
the
weariness
experienced
by
the
while
lying
at
anchor
but
there
are
scenes
now
and
then
that
serve
to
relieve
it
chief
among
these
are
the
auctions
taking
place
while
in
harbour
some
weeks
or
perhaps
months
after
a
sailor
dies
in
an
armed
vessel
his
bag
of
clothes
is
in
this
manner
sold
and
the
proceeds
transferred
to
the
account
of
his
heirs
or
executors
one
of
these
auctions
came
off
in
rio
shortly
after
the
sad
accident
of
baldy
it
was
a
dreamy
quiet
afternoon
and
the
crew
were
listlessly
lying
around
when
suddenly
the
whistle
was
heard
followed
by
the
announcement
hear
there
fore
and
aft
auction
on
the
at
the
sound
the
sailors
sprang
to
their
feet
and
mustered
round
the
presently
up
came
the
steward
marshalling
before
him
three
or
four
of
his
subordinates
carrying
several
bags
which
were
deposited
at
the
base
of
the
mast
our
steward
was
a
rather
gentlemanly
man
in
his
way
like
many
young
americans
of
his
class
he
had
at
various
times
assumed
the
most
opposite
functions
for
a
livelihood
turning
from
one
to
the
other
with
all
the
facility
of
a
clever
adventurer
he
had
been
a
clerk
in
a
steamer
on
the
mississippi
river
an
auctioneer
in
ohio
a
stock
actor
at
the
olympic
theatre
in
new
york
and
now
he
was
steward
in
the
navy
in
the
course
of
this
deversified
career
his
natural
wit
and
waggery
had
been
highly
spiced
and
every
way
improved
and
he
had
acquired
the
last
and
most
difficult
art
of
the
joker
the
art
of
lengthening
his
own
face
while
widening
those
of
his
hearers
preserving
the
utmost
solemnity
while
setting
them
all
in
a
roar
he
was
quite
a
favourite
with
the
sailors
which
in
a
good
degree
was
owing
to
his
humour
but
likewise
to
his
irresistible
romantic
theatrical
manner
of
addressing
them
with
a
dignified
air
he
now
mounted
the
pedestal
of
the
imposing
silence
by
a
theatrical
wave
of
his
hand
meantime
his
subordinates
were
rummaging
the
bags
and
assorting
their
contents
before
him
my
noble
hearties
he
began
will
open
this
auction
by
offering
to
your
impartial
competition
a
very
superior
pair
of
old
boots
and
so
saying
he
dangled
aloft
one
clumsy
cowhide
cylinder
almost
as
large
as
a
fire
bucket
as
a
specimen
of
the
complete
pair
shall
i
have
now
my
noble
tars
for
this
superior
pair
of
boot
cried
a
waister
remember
them
boots
they
were
old
the
there
was
two
on
too
i
want
to
see
sweet
and
pleasant
fellow
said
the
auctioneer
with
his
blandest
accents
other
boot
is
not
just
at
hand
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
it
in
all
respects
corresponds
to
the
one
you
here
does
i
assure
you
and
i
solemnly
guarantee
my
noble
fencibles
he
added
turning
round
upon
all
the
other
boot
is
the
exact
counterpart
of
this
now
then
say
the
word
my
fine
fellows
what
shall
i
have
ten
dollars
did
you
say
politely
bowing
toward
some
indefinite
person
in
the
background
ten
cents
responded
a
voice
cents
ten
cents
gallant
sailors
for
this
noble
pair
of
boots
exclaimed
the
auctioneer
with
affected
horror
must
close
the
auction
my
tars
of
columbia
this
will
never
do
but
have
another
bid
now
come
he
added
coaxingly
and
soothingly
is
it
one
dollar
one
dollar
dollar
going
at
one
dollar
going
just
see
how
it
the
boot
to
and
superior
pair
of
vibrating
at
one
dollar
pay
for
the
nails
in
their
heels
going
and
down
went
the
boots
what
a
sacrifice
what
a
sacrifice
he
sighed
tearfully
eyeing
the
solitary
and
then
glancing
round
the
company
for
sympathy
sacrifice
indeed
exclaimed
jack
chase
who
stood
by
steward
you
are
mark
antony
over
the
body
of
julius
i
am
so
i
am
said
the
auctioneer
without
moving
a
muscle
look
he
exclaimed
suddenly
seizing
the
boot
and
exhibiting
it
on
high
my
noble
tars
if
you
have
tears
prepare
to
shed
them
now
you
all
do
know
this
boot
i
remember
the
first
time
ever
old
bob
put
it
on
on
a
winter
evening
off
cape
horn
between
the
starboard
day
his
precious
grog
was
stopped
look
in
this
place
a
mouse
has
nibbled
through
see
what
a
rent
some
envious
rat
has
made
through
this
another
filed
and
as
he
plucked
his
cursed
rasp
away
mark
how
the
bootleg
gaped
this
was
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
but
whose
are
the
boots
suddenly
assuming
a
air
yours
yours
but
not
a
friend
of
the
lamented
bob
stood
by
of
columbia
said
the
auctioneer
imperatively
boots
must
be
sold
and
if
i
sell
them
one
way
i
must
sell
them
another
how
much
now
for
this
superior
pair
of
old
boots
going
by
now
remember
my
gallant
sailors
what
shall
i
have
one
cent
do
i
hear
going
now
at
one
cent
a
are
they
yours
captain
of
the
waist
well
my
sweet
and
pleasant
friend
i
will
have
them
weighed
out
to
you
when
the
auction
is
in
like
manner
all
the
contents
of
the
bags
were
disposed
of
embracing
old
frocks
trowsers
and
jackets
the
various
sums
for
which
they
went
being
charged
to
the
bidders
on
the
books
of
the
purser
having
been
present
at
this
auction
though
not
a
purchaser
and
seeing
with
what
facility
the
most
dismantled
old
garments
went
off
through
the
magical
cleverness
of
the
accomplished
auctioneer
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
if
ever
i
calmly
and
positively
decided
to
dispose
of
my
famous
white
jacket
this
would
be
the
very
way
to
do
it
i
turned
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
a
long
time
the
weather
in
rio
was
genial
and
warm
and
that
i
would
ever
again
need
such
a
thing
as
a
heavy
quilted
such
a
jacket
as
the
white
one
almost
impossible
yet
i
remembered
the
american
coast
and
that
it
would
probably
be
autumn
when
we
should
arrive
there
yes
i
thought
of
all
that
to
be
sure
nevertheless
the
ungovernable
whim
seized
me
to
sacrifice
my
jacket
and
recklessly
abide
the
consequences
besides
was
it
not
a
horrible
jacket
to
how
many
annoyances
had
it
subjected
me
how
many
scrapes
had
it
dragged
me
into
nay
had
it
not
once
jeopardised
my
very
existence
and
i
had
a
dreadful
presentiment
that
if
i
persisted
in
retaining
it
it
would
do
so
again
enough
i
will
sell
it
i
muttered
and
so
muttering
i
thrust
my
hands
further
down
in
my
waistband
and
walked
the
in
the
stern
concentration
of
an
inflexible
purpose
next
day
hearing
that
another
auction
was
shortly
to
take
place
i
repaired
to
the
office
of
the
steward
with
whom
i
was
upon
rather
friendly
terms
after
vaguely
and
delicately
hinting
at
the
object
of
my
visit
i
came
roundly
to
the
point
and
asked
him
whether
he
could
slip
my
jacket
into
one
of
the
bags
of
clothes
next
to
be
sold
and
so
dispose
of
it
by
public
auction
he
kindly
acquiesced
and
the
thing
was
done
in
due
time
all
hands
were
again
summoned
round
the
the
steward
mounted
his
post
and
the
ceremony
began
meantime
i
lingered
out
of
sight
but
still
within
hearing
on
the
below
gazing
up
at
the
scene
as
it
is
now
so
long
ago
i
will
here
frankly
make
confession
that
i
had
privately
retained
the
services
of
a
the
yankee
pedagogue
and
business
it
would
be
to
linger
near
the
scene
of
the
auction
and
if
the
bids
on
the
jacket
loitered
to
start
it
roundly
himself
and
if
the
bidding
then
became
brisk
he
was
continually
to
strike
in
with
the
most
pertinacious
and
infatuated
bids
and
so
exasperate
competition
into
the
maddest
and
most
extravagant
overtures
a
variety
of
other
articles
having
been
put
up
the
white
jacket
was
slowly
produced
and
held
high
aloft
between
the
thumb
and
was
submitted
to
the
inspection
of
the
discriminating
public
here
it
behooves
me
once
again
to
describe
my
jacket
for
as
a
portrait
taken
at
one
period
of
life
will
not
answer
for
a
later
stage
much
more
this
jacket
of
mine
undergoing
so
many
changes
needs
to
be
painted
again
and
again
in
order
truly
to
present
its
actual
appearance
at
any
given
period
a
premature
old
age
had
now
settled
upon
it
all
over
it
bore
melancholy
sears
of
the
pockets
that
had
once
trenched
it
in
various
directions
some
parts
of
it
were
slightly
mildewed
from
dampness
on
one
side
several
of
the
buttons
were
gone
and
others
were
broken
or
cracked
while
alas
my
many
mad
endeavours
to
rub
it
black
on
the
decks
had
now
imparted
to
the
whole
garment
an
exceedingly
untidy
appearance
such
as
it
was
with
all
its
faults
the
auctioneer
displayed
it
venerable
and
you
gallant
and
you
my
fine
waisters
what
do
you
say
now
for
this
superior
old
jacket
buttons
and
sleeves
lining
and
skirts
it
must
this
day
be
sold
without
reservation
how
much
for
it
my
gallant
tars
of
columbia
say
the
word
and
how
much

exclaimed

of
old

that
white

white

cried
fifty
voices
in
response

the
cry
ran
fore
and
aft
the
ship
like
a
slogan
completely
overwhelming
the
solitary
voice
of
my
private
friend
williams
while
all
hands
gazed
at
it
with
straining
eyes
wondering
how
it
came
among
the
bags
of
deceased
mariners
noble

the

well

one
of
the
slowly
shifting
his
quid
from

cheek
to
the
other
like
a

bunch
of

unless
you
put
up
ten
pounds
of

that
old

the

for

at

of

overboard
and
show
us
something
worth

give
me
a

then
very
good
here
shove
it
aside
have
something
else
while
this
scene
was
going
forward
and
my
white
jacket
was
thus
being
abused
how
my
heart
swelled
within
me
thrice
was
i
on
the
point
of
rushing
out
of
my
and
bearing
it
off
from
derision
but
i
lingered
still
flattering
myself
that
all
would
be
well
and
the
jacket
find
a
purchaser
at
last
but
no
alas
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
it
except
by
rolling
a
shot
in
it
and
committing
it
to
the
deep
but
though
in
my
desperation
i
had
once
contemplated
something
of
that
sort
yet
i
had
now
become
unaccountably
averse
to
it
from
certain
involuntary
superstitious
considerations
if
i
sink
my
jacket
thought
i
it
will
be
sure
to
spread
itself
into
a
bed
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
upon
which
i
shall
sooner
or
later
recline
a
dead
man
so
unable
to
conjure
it
into
the
possession
of
another
and
withheld
from
burying
it
out
of
sight
for
ever
my
jacket
stuck
to
me
like
the
fatal
shirt
on
nessus
chapter
xlviii
purser
steward
and
postmaster
in
a
as
the
steward
so
conspicuously
figured
at
the
unsuccessful
auction
of
my
jacket
it
reminds
me
of
how
important
a
personage
that
official
is
on
board
of
all
he
is
the
man
and
confidential
deputy
and
clerk
of
the
purser
who
intrusts
to
him
all
his
accounts
with
the
crew
while
in
most
cases
he
himself
snug
and
comfortable
in
his
glances
over
a
file
of
newspapers
instead
of
overhauling
his
ledgers
of
all
the
of
a
the
purser
perhaps
stands
foremost
in
importance
though
he
is
but
a
member
of
the
mess
yet
usage
seems
to
assign
him
a
conventional
station
somewhat
above
that
of
his
equals
in
navy
chaplain
surgeon
and
professor
moreover
he
is
frequently
to
be
seen
in
close
conversation
with
the
commodore
who
in
the
neversink
was
more
than
once
known
to
be
slightly
jocular
with
our
purser
upon
several
occasions
also
he
was
called
into
the
cabin
and
remained
closeted
there
for
several
minutes
together
nor
do
i
remember
that
there
ever
happened
a
cabinet
meeting
of
the
barons
the
lieutenants
in
the
cabin
but
the
purser
made
one
of
the
party
doubtless
the
important
fact
of
the
purser
having
under
his
charge
all
the
financial
affairs
of
a
imparts
to
him
the
great
importance
he
enjoys
indeed
we
find
in
every
and
republics
the
personage
at
the
head
of
the
finances
invariably
occupies
a
commanding
position
thus
in
point
of
station
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
is
deemed
superior
to
the
other
heads
of
departments
also
in
england
the
real
office
held
by
the
great
premier
himself
every
one
of
first
lord
of
the
treasury
now
under
this
high
functionary
of
state
the
official
known
as
the
steward
was
head
clerk
of
the
fiscal
affairs
upon
the
he
had
a
regular
full
of
ledgers
journals
and
his
desk
was
as
much
littered
with
papers
as
any
pearl
street
and
much
time
was
devoted
to
his
accounts
for
hours
together
you
would
see
him
through
the
window
of
his
subterranean
office
writing
by
the
light
of
his
perpetual
lamp
the
steward
of
most
ships
is
a
sort
of
postmaster

his

the
when
the
for
the
as
large
as
those
of
the
united
states
on
board
the
neversink
it
was
the
steward
that
sat
at
his
little
window
on
the
and
handed
you
your
letter
or
any
there
were
to
your
address
some
disappointed
applicants
among
the
sailors
would
offer
to
buy
the
epistles
of
their
more
fortunate
shipmates
while
yet
the
seal
was
that
the
sole
and
confidential
reading
of
a
fond
long
domestic
letter
from
any
home
was
far
better
than
no
letter
at
all
in
the
vicinity
of
the
office
of
the
steward
are
the
principal
of
the
purser
where
large
quantities
of
goods
of
every
description
are
to
be
found
on
board
of
those
ships
where
goods
are
permitted
to
be
served
out
to
the
crew
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them
ashore
to
raise
money
more
business
is
transacted
at
the
office
of
a
steward
in
one
morning
than
all
the
dry
goods
shops
in
a
considerable
village
would
transact
in
a
week
once
a
month
with
undeviating
regularity
this
official
has
his
hands
more
than
usually
full
for
once
a
month
certain
printed
bills
called
are
circulated
among
the
crew
and
whatever
you
may
want

returned

the
office
of
the
steward
the
as
they
are
called
are
served
out
to
the
men
and
charged
to
their
accounts
lucky
is
it
for
that
the
outrageous
impositions
to
which
but
a
very
few
years
ago
they
were
subjected
from
the
abuses
in
this
department
of
the
service
and
the
unscrupulous
cupidity
of
many
of
the
is
it
for
them
that
these
things
are
in
a
great
degree
done
away
the
pursers
instead
of
being
at
liberty
to
make
almost
what
they
pleased
from
the
sale
of
their
wares

now
paid
by
regular
stipends
laid
down
by
law
under
the
exploded
system
the
profits
of
some
of
these
officers
were
almost
incredible
in
one
cruise
up
the
mediterranean
the
purser
of
an
american
ship
was
on
good
authority
said
to
have
cleared
the
sum
of
upon
that
he
quitted
the
service
and
retired
into
the
country
shortly
after
his
three
very
extremely
well
the
ideas
that
sailors
entertain
of
pursers
is
expressed
in
a
rather
inelegant
but
expressive
saying
of
theirs
purser
is
a
conjurer
he
can
make
a
dead
man
chew
that
the
accounts
of
a
dead
man
are
sometimes
subjected
to
charges
among
sailors
also
pursers
commonly
go
by
the
name
of
no
wonder
that
on
board
of
the
old
frigate
java
upon
her
return
from
a
cruise
extending
over
a
period
of
more
than
four
years
one
thousand
dollars
paid
off
eighty
of
her
crew
though
the
aggregate
wages
of
the
eighty
for
the
voyage
must
have
amounted
to
about
sixty
thousand
dollars
even
under
the
present
system
the
purser
of
a
ship
for
instance
is
far
better
paid
than
any
other
officer
short
of
captain
or
commodore
while
the
lieutenant
commonly
receives
but
eighteen
hundred
dollars
the
surgeon
of
the
fleet
but
fifteen
hundred
the
chaplain
twelve
hundred
the
purser
of
a
ship
receives
hundred
dollars
in
considering
his
salary
however
his
responsibilities
are
not
to
be
they
are
by
no
means
insignificant
there
are
pursers
in
the
navy
whom
the
sailors
exempt
from
the
insinuations
above
mentioned
nor
as
a
class
are
they
so
obnoxious
to
them
now
as
formerly
for
one
the
florid
old
purser
of
the
coming
into
disciplinary
contact
with
the
seamen
and
being
withal
a
jovial
and
apparently
something
of
a
favourite
with
many
of
the
crew
chapter
xlix
neversink
while
lying
in
the
harbour
of
callao
in
peru
certain
rumours
had
come
to
us
touching
a
war
with
england
growing
out
of
the
northeastern
boundary
question
in
rio
these
rumours
were
increased
and
the
probability
of
hostilities
induced
our
commodore
to
authorize
proceedings
that
closely
brought
home
to
every
man
on
board
the
neversink
his
liability
at
any
time
to
be
killed
at
his
gun
among
other
things
a
number
of
men
were
detailed
to
pass
up
the
rusty
from
the
in
the
hold
and
scrape
them
clean
for
service
the
commodore
was
a
very
neat
gentleman
and
would
not
fire
a
dirty
shot
into
his
foe
it
was
an
interesting
occasion
for
a
tranquil
observer
nor
was
it
altogether
neglected
not
to
recite
the
precise
remarks
made
by
the
seamen
while
pitching
the
shot
up
the
hatchway
from
hand
to
hand
like
schoolboys
playing
ball
ashore
it
will
be
enough
to
say
that
from
the
general
drift
of
their
as
it
was
manifest
that
almost
to
a
man
they
abhorred
the
idea
of
going
into
action
and
why
should
they
desire
a
war
would
their
wages
be
raised
not
a
cent
the
though
ought
to
have
been
an
inducement
but
of
all
the
of
virtue
is
the
most
uncertain
and
this
the
knows
what
then
has
he
to
expect
from
war
what
but
harder
work
and
harder
usage
than
in
peace
a
wooden
leg
or
arm
mortal
wounds
and
death
enough
however
that
by
far
the
majority
of
the
common
sailors
of
the
neversink
were
plainly
concerned
at
the
prospect
of
war
and
were
plainly
averse
to
it
but
with
the
officers
of
the
it
was
just
the
reverse
none
of
them
to
be
sure
in
my
hearing
at
least
verbally
expressed
their
gratification
but
it
was
unavoidably
betrayed
by
the
increased
cheerfulness
of
their
demeanour
toward
each
other
their
frequent
fraternal
conferences
and
their
unwonted
animation
for
several
clays
in
issuing
their
orders
the
voice
of
mad
a
belfry
to
resounded
like
that
famous
bell
of
england
great
tom
of
oxford
as
for
selvagee
he
wore
his
sword
with
a
jaunty
air
and
his
servant
daily
polished
the
blade
but
why
this
contrast
between
the
forecastle
and
the
between
the
and
his
officer
because
though
war
would
equally
jeopardize
the
lives
of
both
yet
while
it
held
out
to
the
sailor
no
promise
of
promotion
and
what
is
called
these
things
fired
the
breast
of
his
officers
it
is
no
pleasing
task
nor
a
thankful
one
to
dive
into
the
souls
of
some
men
but
there
are
occasions
when
to
bring
up
the
mud
from
the
bottom
reveals
to
us
on
what
soundings
we
are
on
what
coast
we
adjoin
how
were
these
officers
to
gain
glory
how
but
by
a
distinguished
slaughtering
of
their
how
were
they
to
be
promoted
how
but
over
the
buried
heads
of
killed
comrades
and
this
hostile
contrast
between
the
feelings
with
which
the
common
seamen
and
the
officers
of
the
neversink
looked
forward
to
this
more
than
possible
war
is
one
of
many
instances
that
might
be
quoted
to
show
the
antagonism
of
their
interests
the
incurable
antagonism
in
which
they
dwell
but
can
men
whose
interests
are
diverse
ever
hope
to
live
together
in
a
harmony
uncoerced
can
the
brotherhood
of
the
race
of
mankind
ever
hope
to
prevail
in
a
where
one
bane
is
almost
blessing
by
abolishing
the
scourge
shall
we
do
away
tyranny
tyranny
which
must
ever
prevail
where
of
two
essentially
antagonistic
classes
in
perpetual
contact
one
is
immeasurably
the
stronger
surely
it
seems
all
but
impossible
and
as
the
very
object
of
a
as
its
name
implies
is
to
fight
the
very
battles
so
naturally
averse
to
the
seamen
so
long
as
a
exists
it
must
ever
remain
a
picture
of
much
that
is
tyrannical
and
repelling
in
human
nature
being
an
establishment
much
more
extensive
than
the
american
navy
the
english
armed
marine
furnishes
a
yet
more
striking
example
of
this
thing
especially
as
the
existence
of
war
produces
so
vast
an

one
of
has
an
audience
with
the
commodore
and
the
captain
on
the
we
had
not
lain
in
rio
long
when
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
mighty
soul
of
my
noble
captain
of
the
jack
deliberate
opinion
was
formed
and
that
our
company
must
have
at
least
one
to
go
ashore
ere
we
weighed
anchor
for
home
here
it
must
be
mentioned
that
concerning
anything
of
this
kind
no
sailor
in
a
ever
presumes
to
be
an
agitator
unless
he
is
of
a
rank
superior
to
a
mere
and
no
one
short
of
a
petty
is
a
captain
of
the
top
a
or
dreams
of
being
a
spokesman
to
the
supreme
authority
of
the
vessel
in
soliciting
any
kind
of
favor
for
himself
and
shipmates
after
canvassing
the
matter
thoroughly
with
several
old
and
other
dignified
jack
hat
in
hand
made
his
appearance
one
fine
evening
at
the
mast
and
waiting
till
captain
claret
drew
nigh
bowed
and
addressed
him
in
his
own
polished
and
poetical
style
in
his
intercourse
with
the
he
always
presumed
upon
his
being
such
a
universal
favourite
this
rio
is
a
charming
harbour
and
we
poor
trusty
valiant
captain
who
with
at
their
head
would
board
the
rock
of
gibraltar
itself
and
carry
it
by
poor
fellows
valiant
captain
have
gazed
round
upon
this
ravishing
landscape
till
we
can
gaze
no
more
will
captain
claret
vouchsafe
one
liberty
and
so
assure
himself
of
eternal
felicity
since
in
our
flowing
cups
he
will
be
ever
after
freshly
remembered
as
jack
thus
rounded
off
with
a
snatch
from
shakspeare
he
saluted
the
captain
with
a
gallant
flourish
of
his
tarpaulin
and
then
bringing
the
rim
to
his
mouth
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
body
thrown
into
a
fine
negligent
attitude
stood
a
picture
of
eloquent
but
passive
appeal
he
seemed
to
say
magnanimous
captain
claret
we
fine
fellows
and
hearts
of
oak
throw
ourselves
upon
your
unparalleled
goodness
what
do
you
want
to
go
ashore
for
asked
the
captain
evasively
and
trying
to
conceal
his
admiration
of
jack
by
affecting
some
haughtiness
sir
sighed
jack
do
the
thirsty
camels
of
the
desert
desire
to
lap
the
waters
of
the
fountain
and
roll
in
the
green
grass
of
the
oasis
are
we
not
but
just
from
the
ocean
sahara
and
is
not
this
rio
a
verdant
spot
noble
captain
surely
you
will
not
keep
us
always
tethered
at
anchor
when
a
little
more
cable
would
admit
of
our
cropping
the
herbage
and
it
is
a
weary
thing
captain
claret
to
be
imprisoned
month
after
month
on
the
without
so
much
as
smelling
a
citron
ah
captain
claret
what
sings
sweet
waller
who
can
always
on
the
billows
lie
the
watery
wilderness
yields
no
compared
with
such
a
prisoner

captain
thrice
happy
who
in
battle
slain
in
cause
the
trojan
pain
version
sir
not
the
original
and
so
saying
jack
once
more
brought
his
to
his
mouth
and
slightly
bending
forward
stood
mute
at
this
juncture
the
most
serene
commodore
himself
happened
to
emerge
from
the
his
gilded
buttons
epaulets
and
the
gold
lace
on
his
chapeau
glittering
in
the
flooding
sunset
attracted
by
the
scene
between
captain
claret
and
so
and
admired
a
commoner
as
jack
chase
he
approached
and
assuming
for
the
moment
an
air
of
pleasant
shown
to
his
noble
barons
the
officers
of
the
said
with
a
smile
jack
you
and
your
shipmates
are
after
some
favour
i
liberty
is
it
not
whether
it
was
the
horizontal
setting
sun
streaming
along
the
deck
that
blinded
jack
or
whether
it
was
in
homage
of
the
mighty
commodore
there
is
no
telling
but
just
at
this
juncture
noble
jack
was
standing
reverentially
holding
his
hat
to
his
brow
like
a
man
with
weak
eyes
commodore
said
he
at
last
audience
is
indeed
an
honour
undeserved
i
almost
sink
beneath
it
yes
valiant
commodore
your
sagacious
mind
has
truly
divined
our
object
liberty
sir
liberty
is
indeed
our
humble
prayer
i
trust
your
honourable
wound
received
in
glorious
battle
valiant
comodore
pains
you
less
today
than
cunning
jack
cried
the
commodore
by
no
means
blind
to
the
bold
sortie
of
his
flattery
but
not
at
all
displeased
with
it
in
more
respects
than
one
our
wound
was
his
weak
side
think
we
must
give
them
liberty
he
added
turning
to
captain
claret
who
thereupon
waving
jack
further
off
fell
into
confidential
discourse
with
his
superior
jack
we
will
see
about
it
at
last
cried
the
commodore
advancing
think
we
must
let
you
your
duty
captain
of
the
said
the
captain
rather
stiffly
he
wished
to
neutralise
somewhat
the
effect
of
the
condescension
besides
he
had
much
rather
the
commodore
had
been
in
his
cabin
his
presence
for
the
time
affected
his
own
supremacy
in
his
ship
but
jack
was
nowise
cast
down
by
the
coldness
he
felt
safe
enough
so
he
proceeded
to
offer
his
acknowledgments
gentlemen
he
sighed
pains
are
registered
where
every
day
i
turn
the
leaf
to
read
valiant
commodore
and
captain
the
thane
says
to
the
noble
lords
ross
and
and
long
and
lingeringly
bowing
to
the
two
noble
officers
jack
backed
away
from
their
presence
still
shading
his
eyes
with
the
broad
rim
of
his
hat

for
ever
cried
his
shipmates
as
he
carried
the
grateful
news
of
liberty
to
them
on
the
forecastle
can
talk
to
commodores
like
our
matchless
jack
chapter
lii
something
concerning
midshipmen
it
was
the
next
morning
after
matchless
interview
with
the
commodore
and
captain
that
a
little
incident
occurred
soon
forgotten
by
the
crew
at
large
but
long
remembered
by
the
few
seamen
who
were
in
the
habit
of
closely
scrutinising
proceedings
upon
the
face
of
it
it
was
but
a
common
least
in
a
flogging
of
a
man
at
the
gangway
but
the
of
circumstances
in
the
case
were
of
a
nature
that
magnified
this
particular
flogging
into
a
matter
of
no
small
importance
the
story
itself
can
not
here
be
related
it
would
not
well
bear
recital
enough
that
the
person
flogged
was
a
man
of
the
forlorn
miserable
object
truly
one
of
those
wretched
landsmen
sometimes
driven
into
the
navy
by
their
unfitness
for
all
things
else
even
as
others
are
driven
into
the
workhouse
he
was
flogged
at
the
complaint
of
a
midshipman
and
hereby
hangs
the
drift
of
the
thing
for
though
this
waister
was
so
ignoble
a
mortal
yet
his
being
scourged
on
this
one
occasion
indirectly
proceeded
from
the
mere
wanton
spite
and
unscrupulousness
of
the
midshipman
in
youth
who
was
apt
to
indulge
at
times
in
undignified
familiarities
with
some
of
the
men
who
sooner
or
later
almost
always
suffered
from
his
capricious
preferences
but
the
leading
principle
that
was
involved
in
this
affair
is
far
too
mischievous
to
be
lightly
dismissed
in
most
cases
it
would
seem
to
be
a
cardinal
principle
with
a
navy
captain
that
his
subordinates
are
disintegrated
parts
of
himself
detached
from
the
main
body
on
special
service
and
that
the
order
of
the
minutest
midshipman
must
be
as
deferentially
obeyed
by
the
seamen
as
if
proceeding
from
the
commodore
on
the
poop
this
principle
was
once
emphasised
in
a
remarkable
manner
by
the
valiant
and
handsome
sir
peter
parker
upon
whose
death
on
a
national
arson
expedition
on
the
shores
of
chesapeake
bay
in
or
lord
byron
wrote
his
stanzas
the
god
of
war
said
sir
peter
to
his
sailors
make
you
touch
your
hat
to
a
coat
if
only
hung
on
a
broomstick
to
dry
that
the
king
in
the
eye
of
the
law
can
do
no
wrong
is
the
fiction
of
despotic
states
but
it
has
remained
for
the
navies
of
constitutional
monarchies
and
republics
to
magnify
this
fiction
by
indirectly
extending
it
to
all
the
subordinates
of
an
armed
chief
magistrate
and
though
judicially
unrecognised
and
unacknowledged
by
the
officers
themselves
yet
this
is
the
principle
that
pervades
the
fleet
this
is
the
principle
that
is
every
hour
acted
upon
and
to
sustain
which
thousands
of
seamen
have
been
flogged
at
the
gangway
however
childish
ignorant
stupid
or
idiotic
a
midshipman
if
he
but
orders
a
sailor
to
perform
even
the
most
absurd
action
that
man
is
not
only
bound
to
render
instant
and
unanswering
obedience
but
he
would
refuse
at
his
peril
and
if
having
obeyed
he
should
then
complain
to
the
captain
and
the
captain
in
his
own
mind
should
be
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
impropriety
perhaps
of
the
illegality
of
the
order
yet
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
would
not
publicly
reprimand
the
midshipman
nor
by
the
slightest
token
admit
before
the
complainant
that
in
this
particular
thing
the
midshipman
had
done
otherwise
than
perfectly
right
upon
a
complaining
of
a
seaman
to
lord
collingwood
when
captain
of
a
ship
he
ordered
the
man
for
punishment
and
in
the
interval
calling
the
midshipman
aside
said
to
him
all
probability
now
the
fault
is
know
therefore
when
the
man
is
brought
to
the
mast
you
had
better
ask
for
his
accordingly
upon
the
public
intercession
collingwood
turning
to
the
culprit
said
young
gentleman
has
pleaded
so
humanely
for
you
that
in
hope
you
feel
a
due
gratitude
to
him
for
his
benevolence
i
will
for
this
time
overlook
your
this
story

related
by
the
editor

the
kindheartedness

collingood
was
in
reality
one
of
the
most
just
humane
and
benevolent
admirals
that
ever
hoisted
a
flag
for
a
collingwood
was
a
man
in
a
million
but
if
a
man
like
him
swayed
by
old
usages
could
thus
violate
the
commonest
principle
of
however
good
motives
at
must
be
expected
from
other
captains
not
so
eminently
gifted
with
noble
traits
as
collingwood
and
if
the
corps
of
american
midshipmen
is
mostly
replenished
from
the
nursery
the
counter
and
the
lap
of
unrestrained
indulgence
at
home
and
if
most
of
them
at
least
by
their
impotency
as
officers
in
all
important
functions
at
sea
by
their
boyish
and
overweening
conceit
of
their
gold
lace
by
their
overbearing
manner
toward
the
seamen
and
by
their
peculiar
aptitude
to
construe
the
merest
trivialities
of
manner
into
set
affronts
against
their
dignity
if
by
all
this
they
sometimes
contract
the
of
the
seamen
and
if
in
a
thousand
ways
the
seamen
can
not
but
betray
easy
for
any
of
these
midshipmen
who
may
happen
to
be
unrestrained
by
moral
principle
to
resort
to
spiteful
practices
in
procuring
vengeance
upon
the
offenders
in
many
instances
to
the
extremity
of
the
lash
since
as
we
have
seen
the
tacit
principle
in
the
navy
seems
to
be
that
in
his
ordinary
intercourse
with
the
sailors
a
midshipman
can
do
nothing
obnoxious
to
the
public
censure
of
his
superiors
fellow
get
you
before
long
is
often
heard
from
a
midshipman
to
a
sailor
who
in
some
way
not
open
to
the
judicial
action
of
the
captain
has
chanced
to
offend
him
at
times
you
will
see
one
of
these
lads
not
five
feet
high
gazing
up
with
inflamed
eye
at
some
venerable
of
a
forecastle
man
cursing
and
insulting
him
by
every
epithet
deemed
most
scandalous
and
unendurable
among
men
yet
that
indignant
tongue
is
by
the
law
that
suspends
death
itself
over
his
head
should
his
passion
discharge
the
slightest
blow
at
the
that
spits
at
his
feet
but
since
what
human
nature
is
and
what
it
must
for
ever
continue
to
be
is
well
enough
understood
for
most
practical
purposes
it
needs
no
special
example
to
prove
that
where
the
merest
boys
indiscriminately
snatched
from
the
human
family
are
given
such
authority
over
mature
men
the
results
must
be
proportionable
in
monstrousness
to
the
custom
that
authorises
this
worse
than
cruel
absurdity
nor
is
it
unworthy
of
remark
that
while
the
and
most
heroic
of
the
topmost
stature
including
lord
nelson
regarded
flogging
in
the
navy
with
the
deepest
concern
and
not
without
weighty
scruples
touching
its
general
necessity
still
one
who
has
seen
much
of
midshipmen
can
truly
say
that
he
has
seen
but
few
midshipmen
who
were
not
enthusiastic
advocates
and
admirers
of
scourging
it
would
almost
seem
that
they
themselves
having
so
recently
escaped
the
posterior
discipline
of
the
nursery
and
the
infant
school
are
impatient
to
recover
from
those
smarting
reminiscences
by
mincing
the
backs
of
american
freemen
it
should
not
to
be
omitted
here
that
the
midshipmen
in
the
english
navy
are
not
permitted
to
be
quite
so
imperious
as
in
the
american
ships
they
are
divided
into
three
i
think
probationary
classes
of
instead
of
being
at
once
advanced
to
a
warrant
nor
will
you
fail
to
remark
when
you
see
an
english
cutter
officered
by
one
of
those
volunteers
that
the
boy
does
not
so
strut
and
slap
his
with
a
bobadil
air
and
anticipatingly
feel
of
the
place
where
his
warlike
whiskers
are
going
to
be
and
sputter
out
oaths
so
at
the
men
as
is
too
often
the
case
with
the
little
boys
wearing
anchors
on
their
lapels
in
the
american
navy
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
at
times
you
see
midshipmen
who
are
noble
little
fellows
and
not
at
all
disliked
by
the
crew
besides
three
gallant
youths
one
little
lad
in
particular
in
the
neversink
was
such
a
one
from
his
diminutiveness
he
went
by
the
name
of
among
the
seamen
without
being
exactly
familiar
with
them
he
had
yet
become
a
general
favourite
by
reason
of
his
kindness
of
manner
and
never
cursing
them
it
was
amusing
to
hear
some
of
the
older
tritons
invoke
blessings
upon
the
youngster
when
his
kind
tones
fell
on
their
ears
good
luck
to
you
sir
touching
their
hats
to
the
little
man
have
a
soul
to
be
saved
sir
there
was
a
wonderful
deal
of
meaning
involved
in
the
latter
sentence
have
a
soul
to
be
is
the
phrase
which
a
peculiarly
applies
to
a
humane
and
officer
it
also
implies
that
the
majority
of
officers
are
regarded
by
them
in
such
a
light
that
they
deny
to
them
the
possession
of
souls
ah
but
these
plebeians
sometimes
have
a
sublime
vengeance
upon
patricians
imagine
an
outcast
old
sailor
seriously
cherishing
the
purely
speculative
conceit
that
some
bully
in
epaulets
who
orders
him
to
and
fro
like
a
slave
is
of
an
organization
immeasurably
inferior
to
himself
must
at
last
perish
with
the
brutes
while
he
goes
to
his
immortality
in
heaven
but
from
what
has
been
said
in
this
chapter
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
a
midshipman
leads
a
life
in
a
far
from
it
he
lords
it
over
those
below
him
while
lorded
over
himself
by
his
superiors
it
is
as
if
with
one
hand
a
snapped
his
fingers
at
a
dog
and
at
the
same
time
received
upon
the
other
the
discipline
of
the
ferule
and
though
by
the
american
articles
of
war
a
navy
captain
can
not
of
his
own
authority
legally
punish
a
midshipman
otherwise
than
by
suspension
from
duty
the
same
as
with
respect
to
the
officers
yet
this
is
one
of
those
which
the
captain
to
a
certain
extent
observes
or
disregards
at
his
pleasure
many
instances
might
be
related
of
the
petty
mortifications
and
official
insults
inflicted
by
some
captains
upon
their
midshipmen
far
more
severe
in
one
sense
than
the
punishment
of
sending
them
to
the
though
not
so
arbitrary
as
sending
them
before
the
mast
to
do
duty
with
the
common
custom
in
former
times
pursued
by
captains
in
the
english
navy
captain
claret
himself
had
no
special
fondness
for
midshipmen
a
tall
overgrown
young
midshipman
about
sixteen
years
old
having
fallen
under
his
displeasure
he
interrupted
the
humble
apologies
he
was
making
by
saying
a
word
sir
not
hear
a
word
mount
the
netting
sir
and
stand
there
till
you
are
ordered
to
come
down
the
midshipman
obeyed
and
in
full
sight
of
the
entire
company
captain
claret
promenaded
to
and
fro
below
his
lofty
perch
reading
him
a
most
aggravating
lecture
upon
his
alleged
misconduct
to
a
lad
of
sensibility
such
treatment
must
have
been
almost
as
stinging
as
the
lash
itself
would
have
been
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
wherever
these
chapters
treat
of
midshipmen
the
officers
known
as
are
not
at
all
referred
to
in
the
american
navy
these
officers
form
a
class
of
young
men
who
having
seen
sufficient
service
at
sea
as
midshipmen
to
pass
an
examination
before
a
board
of
commodores
are
promoted
to
the
rank
of
introductory
to
that
of
lieutenant
they
are
supposed
to
be
qualified
to
do
duty
as
lieutenants
and
in
some
cases
temporarily
serve
as
such
the
difference
between
a
and
a
midshipman
may
be
also
inferred
from
their
respective
rates
of
pay
the
former
upon
receives
a
year
the
latter
there
were
no
in
the
neversink
chapter
liii
seafaring
persons
peculiarly
subject
to
being
under
the
effects
of
this
upon
a
captain
it
has
been
said
that
some
midshipmen
in
certain
cases
are
guilty
of
spiteful
practices
against
the
but
as
these
midshipmen
are
presumed
to
have
received
the
liberal
and
lofty
breeding
of
gentlemen
it
would
seem
all
but
incredible
that
any
of
their
corps
could
descend
to
the
paltriness
of
cherishing
personal
malice
against
so
conventionally
degraded
a
being
as
a
sailor
so
indeed
it
would
seem
but
when
all
the
circumstances
are
considered
it
will
not
appear
extraordinary
that
some
of
them
should
thus
cast
discredit
upon
the
warrants
they
wear
title
and
rank
and
wealth
and
education
can
not
unmake
human
nature
the
same
in
and
commodore
its
only
differences
lie
in
the
different
modes
of
development
at
sea
a
frigate
houses
and
homes
five
hundred
mortals
in
a
space
so
contracted
that
they
can
hardly
so
much
as
move
but
they
touch
cut
off
from
all
those
outward
passing
things
which
ashore
employ
the
eyes
tongues
and
thoughts
of
landsmen
the
inmates
of
a
frigate
are
thrown
upon
themselves
and
each
other
and
all
their
ponderings
are
introspective
a
morbidness
of
mind
is
often
the
consequence
especially
upon
long
voyages
accompanied
by
foul
weather
calms
or
nor
does
this
exempt
from
its
evil
influence
any
rank
on
board
indeed
high
station
only
ministers
to
it
the
more
since
the
higher
the
rank
in
a
the
less
companionship
it
is
an
odious
unthankful
repugnant
thing
to
dwell
upon
a
subject
like
this
nevertheless
be
it
said
that
through
these
jaundiced
influences
even
the
captain
of
a
frigate
is
in
some
cases
indirectly
induced
to
the
infliction
of
corporal
punishment
upon
a
seaman
never
sail
under
a
navy
captain
whom
you
suspect
of
being
dyspeptic
or
constitutionally
prone
to
hypochondria
the
manifestation
of
these
things
is
sometimes
remarkable
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
cruise
while
making
a
long
tedious
run
from
mazatlan
to
callao
on
the
main
baffled
by
light
head
winds
and
frequent
intermitting
calms
when
all
hands
were
heartily
wearied
by
the
torrid
monotonous
sea
a
by
the
name
of
a
character
in
his
in
the
waist
among
a
crowd
of
seamen
touched
me
and
said
see
the
old
man
there
walking
the
poop
well
he
look
as
if
he
wanted
to
flog
someone
look
at
him
but
to
me
at
least
no
such
indications
were
visible
in
the
deportment
of
the
captain
though
his
thrashing
the
with
the
slack
of
the
looked
a
little
suspicious
but
any
one
might
have
been
doing
that
to
pass
away
a
calm
on
it
said
the
must
somehow
have
thought
i
was
making
sport
of
a
while
ago
when
i
was
only
taking
off
old
priming
the
mate
just
look
at
him
once
while
i
make
believe
coil
this
here
rope
if
there
a
dozen
in
that
my
name
is
if
i
could
only
touch
my
tile
to
him
now
and
take
my
bible
oath
on
it
that
i
was
only
taking
off
priming
and
not
he
have
such
hard
thoughts
of
me
but
that
be
done
think
i
meant
to
insult
him
well
it
be
helped
i
suppose
i
must
look
out
for
a
dozen
afore
i
had
an
incredulous
laugh
at
this
but
two
days
afterward
when
we
were
hoisting
the
and
the
lieutenant
of
the
watch
was
reprimanding
the
crowd
of
seamen
at
the
halyards
for
their
the
sail
was
but
just
crawling
up
to
its
place
owing
to
the
languor
of
the
men
induced
by
the
captain
who
had
been
impatiently
walking
the
deck
suddenly
stopped
short
and
darting
his
eyes
among
the
seamen
suddenly
fixed
them
crying
out
candy
and
be
damned
to
you
you
pull
an
ounce
you
blackguard
stand
up
to
that
gun
sir
teach
you
to
be
grinning
over
a
rope
that
way
without
lending
your
pound
of
beef
to
it
mate
your
give
that
man
a
removing
his
hat
the
mate
looked
into
the
crown
aghast
the
coiled
rope
usually
worn
there
was
not
to
be
found
but
the
next
instant
it
slid
from
the
top
of
his
head
to
the
deck
picking
it
up
and
straightening
it
out
he
advanced
toward
the
sailor
said
candy
touching
and
retouching
his
cap
to
the
captain
was
pulling
sir
as
much
as
the
rest
sir
i
was
indeed
up
to
that
gun
cried
the
captain
mate
do
your
three
stripes
were
given
when
the
captain
raised
his
finger
do
you
dare
stand
up
to
be
flogged
with
your
hat
on
take
it
off
sir
the
phrase
here
used
i
have
never
seen
either
written
or
printed
and
should
not
like
to
be
the
first
person
to
introduce
it
to
the
public
candy
dropped
it
on
deck
go
on
and
the
sailor
received
his
dozen
with
his
hand
to
his
back
he
came
up
to
me
where
i
stood
among
the
saying
lord
o
lord
that
mate
too
had
a
spite
agin
me
he
always
thought
it
was
that
set
afloat
that
yarn
about
his
wife
in
norfolk
o
lord
just
run
your
hand
under
my
shirt
will
you
there
he
have
a
spite
agin
me
to
raise
such
bars
as
them
and
my
shirt
all
cut
to
pieces
it
damn
me
but
these
coltings
puts
the
tin
in
the
pocket
o
lord
my
back
feels
as
if
there
was
a
gridiron
lashed
to
it
but
i
told
you
curse
on
him
say
thought
i
meant
and
not
chapter

given
whenever
in
intervals
of
mild
benevolence
or
yielding
to
mere
politic
dictates
kings
and
commodores
relax
the
yoke
of
servitude
they
should
see
to
it
well
that
the
concession
seem
not
too
sudden
or
unqualified
for
in
the
estimation
that
might
argue
feebleness
or
fear
hence
it
was
perhaps
that
though
noble
jack
had
carried
the
day
captive
in
his
audience
at
the
mast
yet
more
than
hours
elapsed
ere
anything
official
was
heard
of
the
his
shipmates
so
earnestly
coveted
some
of
the
people
began
to
growl
and
grumble

the
commodore
must
keep
his
next
day
about
a
mighty
whistling
and
piping

heard
at
the
and
presently
the
voice
was
heard
hear
there
fore
and
aft
all
you
watch
get
ready
to
go
ashore
on
liberty
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
a
young
standing
by
at
the
time
whipped
the
tarpaulin
from
his
head
and
smashed
it
like
a
pancake
on
the
deck
he
shouted
leaping
down
into
the
after
his
bag
at
the
appointed
hour
the
mustered
round
the
capstan
at
which
stood
our
old
first
lord
of
the
treasury
and
the
purser
with
several
goodly
bags
of
dollars
piled
up
on
the
capstan
he
helped
us
all
round
to
half
a
handful
or
so
and
then
the
boats
were
manned
and
like
so
many
esterhazys
we
were
pulled
ashore
by
our
shipmates
all
their
lives
lords
may
live
in
listless
state
but
give
the
commoners
a
holiday
and
they
outlord
the
commodore
himself
the
company
were
divided
into
four
sections
or
only
one
of
which
were
on
shore
at
a
time
the
rest
remaining
to
garrison
the
term
of
liberty
for
each
being
hours
with
jack
chase
and
a
few
other
discreet
and
gentlemanly
i
went
ashore
on
the
first
day
with
the
first
our
own
little
party
had
a
charming
time
we
saw
many
fine
sights
fell
all
sailors
dashing
adventures
but
though
not
a
few
good
chapters
might
be
written
on
this
head
i
must
again
forbear
for
in
this
book
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
shore
further
than
to
glance
at
it
now
and
then
from
the
water
my
world
alone
must
supply
me
with
the
staple
of
my
matter
i
have
taken
an
oath
to
keep
afloat
to
the
last
letter
of
my
narrative
had
they
all
been
as
punctual
as
jack
party
the
whole
of
had
been
safe
on
board
the
frigate
at
the
expiration
of
the
hours
but
this
was
not
the
case
and
during
the
entire
day
succeeding
the
midshipmen
and
others
were
engaged
in
ferreting
them
out
of
their
on
shore
and
bringing
them
off
in
scattered
detachments
to
the
ship
they
came
in
all
imaginable
stages
of
intoxication
some
with
blackened
eyes
and
broken
heads
some
still
more
severely
injured
having
been
stabbed
in
frays
with
the
portuguese
soldiers
others
unharmed
were
immediately
dropped
on
the
between
the
guns
where
they
lay
snoring
for
the
rest
of
the
day
as
a
considerable
degree
of
license
is
invariably
permitted
to
just
liberty
and
as
well
know
this
to
be
the
case
they
occasionally
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
to
talk
very
frankly
to
the
officers
when
they
first
cross
the
gangway
taking
care
meanwhile
to
reel
about
very
industriously
so
that
there
shall
be
no
doubt
about
their
being
seriously
intoxicated
and
altogether
for
the
time
and
though
but
few
of
them
have
cause
to
feign
intoxication
yet
some
individuals
may
be
suspected
of
enacting
a
studied
part
upon
these
occasions
by
certain
when
really
inebriated
some
of
the
sailors
must
have
previously
determined
upon
their
conduct
just
as
some
persons
who
before
taking
the
exhilarating
gas
secretly
make
up
their
minds
to
perform
certain
mad
feats
while
under
its
influence
which
feats
consequently
come
to
pass
precisely
as
if
the
actors
were
not
accountable
for
them
for
several
days
while
the
other
were
given
liberty
the
neversink
presented
a
sad
scene
she
was
more
like
a
madhouse
than
a
frigate
the
resounded
with
frantic
fights
shouts
and
songs
all
visitors
from
shore
were
kept
at
a
length
these
scenes
however
are
nothing
to
those
which
have
repeatedly
been
enacted
in
american
upon
other
stations
but
the
custom
of
introducing
women
on
board
in
harbour
is
now
pretty
much
discontinued
both
in
the
english
and
american
navy
unless
a
ship
commanded
by
some
dissolute
captain
happens
to
lie
in
some
far
away
outlandish
port
in
the
pacific
or
indian
ocean
the
british
ship
royal
george
which
in
sunk
at
her
anchors
at
spithead
carried
down
three
hundred
english
women
among
the
one
thousand
souls
that
were
drowned
on
that
memorable
morning
when
at
last
after
all
the
mad
tumult
and
contention
of
the
reaction
came
our
frigate
presented
a
very
different
scene
the
men
looked
jaded
and
wan
lethargic
and
lazy
and
many
an
old
mariner
with
hand
upon
abdomen
called
upon
the
to
witness
that
there
were
more
in
the
neversink
than
those
in
the
galley
such
are
the
lamentable
effects
of
suddenly
and
completely
releasing
of
a
from
arbitrary
discipline
it
shows
that
to
such
at
first
must
be
administered
in
small
and
moderate
quantities
increasing
with
the
capacity
to
make
good
use
of
it
of
course
while
we
lay
in
rio
our
officers
frequently
went
ashore
for
pleasure
and
as
a
general
thing
conducted
themselves
with
propriety
but
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
say
that
as
for
lieutenant
mad
jack
he
enjoyed
himself
so
delightfully
for
three
consecutive
days
in
the
town
that
upon
returning
to
the
ship
he
sent
his
card
to
the
surgeon
with
his
compliments
begging
him
to
drop
into
his
the
first
time
he
happened
to
pass
that
way
in
the
but
one
of
our
mates
a
young
medico
of
fine
family
but
slender
fortune
must
have
created
by
far
the
strongest
impression
among
the
hidalgoes
of
rio
he
had
read
don
quixote
and
instead
of
curing
him
of
his
quixotism
as
it
ought
to
have
done
it
only
made
him
still
more
quixotic
indeed
there
are
some
natures
concerning
whose
moral
maladies
the
grand
maxim
of
similia
similibus
curantur
hahneman
does
not
hold
true
since
with
them
not
but
only
aggravates
though
on
the
other
hand
so
incurable
are
the
moral
maladies
of
such
persons
that
the
antagonist
maxim
contrariis
often
proves
equally
false
of
a
warm
tropical
day
this
mate
must
needs
go
ashore
in
his
blue
cloth
wearing
it
with
a
gallant
spanish
toss
over
his
cavalier
shoulder
by
noon
he
perspired
very
freely
but
then
his
cloak
attracted
all
eyes
and
that
was
huge
satisfaction
nevertheless
his
being
and
spavined
of
one
leg
sorely
impaired
the
effect
of
this
hidalgo
cloak
which
was
rusty
in
front
where
his
chin
rubbed
against
it
and
a
good
deal
bedraggled
all
over
from
his
having
used
it
as
a
counterpane
off
cape
horn
as
for
the
midshipmen
there
is
no
knowing
what
their
mammas
would
have
said
to
their
conduct
in
rio
three
of
them
drank
a
good
deal
too
much
and
when
they
came
on
board
the
captain
ordered
them
to
be
sewed
up
in
their
hammocks
to
cut
short
their
obstreperous
capers
till
sober
this
shows
how
unwise
it
is
to
allow
children
yet
in
their
teens
to
wander
so
far
from
home
it
more
especially
illustrates
the
folly
of
giving
them
long

throughout

in

he
conducted
himself

a

destitute

the
allusion
in
the
preceding
chapter
to
the
early
age
at
which
some
of
the
midshipmen
enter
the
navy
suggests
some
thoughts
relative
to
more
important
considerations
a
very
general
modern
impression
seems
to
be
that
in
order
to
learn
the
profession
of
a
a
boy
can
hardly
be
sent
to
sea
too
early
to
a
certain
extent
this
may
be
a
mistake
other
professions
involving
a
knowledge
of
technicalities
and
things
restricted
to
one
particular
field
of
action
are
frequently
mastered
by
men
who
begin
after
the
age
of
or
even
at
a
later
period
of
life
it
was
only
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
the
british
military
and
naval
services
were
kept
distinct

to
that
epoch

by

robert
blake
perhaps
one
of
the
most
accomplished
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
successful
admirals
that
ever
hoisted
a
flag
was
more
than
half
a
century
old
years
before
he
entered
the
naval
service
or
had
aught
to
do
professionally
with
a
ship
he
was
of
a
studious
turn
and
after
leaving
oxford
resided
quietly
on
his
estate
a
country
gentleman
till
his
year
soon
after
which
he
became
connected
with
the
parliamentary
army
the
historian
clarendon
says
of
him
was
the
first
man
that
made
it
manifest
that
the
science
seamanship
might
be
attained
in
less
time
than
was
and
doubtless
it
was
to
his
shore
sympathies
that
the
humanity
and
kindness
which
blake
evinced
in
his
intercourse
with
the
sailors
is
in
a
large
degree
to
be
imputed
midshipmen
sent
into
the
navy
at
a
very
early
age
are
exposed
to
the
passive
reception
of
all
the
prejudices
of
the
in
favour
of
ancient
usages
however
useless
or
pernicious
those
prejudices
grow
up
with
them
and
solidify
with
their
very
bones
as
they
rise
in
rank
they
naturally
carry
them
up
whence
the
inveterate
repugnance
of
many
commodores
and
captains
to
the
slightest
innovations
in
the
service
however
salutary
they
may
appear
to
landsmen
it
is
hardly
to
be
doubted
that
in
matters
connected
with
the
general
welfare
of
the
navy
government
has
paid
rather
too
much
deference
to
the
opinions
of
the
officers
of
the
navy
considering
them
as
men
almost
born
to
the
service
and
therefore
far
better
qualified
to
judge
concerning
any
and
all
questions
touching
it
than
people
on
shore
but
in
a
nation
under
a
liberal
constitution
it
must
ever
be
unwise
to
make
too
distinct
and
peculiar
the
profession
of
either
branch
of
its
military
men

in
a
country
like
ours
nothing
is
at

be
apprehended
of
their
gaining
political
rule
but
not
a
little
is
to
be
apprehended
concerning
their
perpetuating
or
creating
abuses
among
their
subordinates
unless
civilians
have
full
cognisance
of
their
administrative
affairs
and
account
themselves
competent
to
the
complete
overlooking

ordering

do
wrong

we
in
any
way
contribute
to
the
prevailing
mystification
that
has
been
thrown
about
the
internal
affairs
of
the
national
hitherto
those
affairs
have
been
regarded
even
by
some
high
state
functionaries
as
things
beyond
their
too
technical
and
mysterious
to
be
fully
comprehended
by
landsmen
and
this
it
is
that
has
perpetuated
in
the
navy
many
evils
that
otherwise
would
have
been
abolished
in
the
general
amelioration
of
other
things
the
army
is
sometimes
remodelled
but
the
navy
goes
down
from
generation
to
generation
almost
untouched
and
unquestioned
as
if
its
code
were
infallible
and
itself
a
piece
of
perfection
that
no
statesman
could
improve
when
a
secretary
of
the
navy
ventures
to
innovate
upon
its
established
customs

of

he

manned

long
ceremonial
of
paying

homage

often
more
courteous

royalists
themselves

doubtless
this

it

have
been

its

on
the
loftiest

whence
it
looks
down
upon
all

the

formed

of
the

caciques
of
the
country
and
upon
the
establishment
of

was
symbolically
retained
by

his
imperial
majesty
was
yet
in
his
youth
rather
corpulent
if
anything
with
a
pleasant
face
and
a
polite
indifferent
and
easy
address
his
manners
indeed
were
entirely
unexceptionable
now
here
thought
i
is
a
very
fine
lad
with
very
fine
prospects
before
him
he
is
supreme
emperor
of
all
these
brazils
he
has
no
stormy
to
stand
he
can
lay
abed
of
mornings
just
as
long
as
he
pleases
any
gentleman
in
rio
would
be
proud
of
his
personal
acquaintance
and
the
prettiest
girl
in
all
south
america
would
deem
herself
honoured
with
the
least
glance
from
the
acutest
angle
of
his
eye
yes
this
young
emperor
will
have
a
fine
time
of
this
life
even
so
long
as
he
condescends
to
exist
every
one
jumps
to
obey
him
and
see
as
i
live
there
is
an
old
nobleman
in
his
marquis
they
call
him
old
enough
to
be
his
in
the
hot
sun
is
standing
bareheaded
before
him
while
the
emperor
carries
his
hat
on
his
head
suppose
that
old
gentleman
now
said
a
young
new
england
tar
beside
me
consider
it
a
great
honour
to
put
on
his
royal
boots
and
yet
if
yonder
emperor
and
i
were
to
strip
and
jump
overboard
for
a
bath
it
would
be
hard
telling
which
was
of
the
blood
royal
when
we
should
once
be
in
the
water
look
you
don
pedro
he
added
do
you
come
to
be
emperor
tell
me
that
you
can
not
pull
as
many
pounds
as
i
on
the
you
are
not
as
tall
as
i
your

is
a

mine

how
do
you
come
to
be
a
with
that
thin
pair
of
spars
a
indeed
you
mean
said
i
willing
to
correct
the
rhetoric
of
so
fierce
a
republican
and
by
so
doing
chastise
his
censoriousness
it
is
he
replied
a
bragger
indeed
see
that
feather
in
his
cap
see
how
he
struts
in
that
coat
he
may
well
wear

i

it
was
just
after

the

formed
a
sort
of

only
the

was
absent

over
the
smoke
of

having
cleared

and
the
martial
outburst

the

were
called
down
from

and
the
drum
beat
to
quarters
to
quarters
we
went
and
there
we
stood
up
by
our
iron
while
our
royal
and
noble
visitors
promenaded
along
the
batteries
breaking
out
into
frequent
exclamations
at
our
warlike
array
the
extreme
neatness
of
our
garments
and
above
all
the
extraordinary
polish
of
the
about
the
great
guns
and
the
marvellous
whiteness
of
the
decks

a

o

cried
the
emperor
himself
complacently
folding
his
royal
arms
and
serenely
gazing
along
our
ranks
and
was
the
burden
of
the
three
noble
courtiers
very
pleasing
the
simple
rendering
of
don
imperial
remark
ay
growled
a
grim
behind
me
all
devilish
fine
for
you
nobs
to
look
at
but
what
would
you
say
if
you
had
to
the
deck
yourselves
and
wear
out
your
elbows
in
polishing
this
cursed
old
iron
besides
getting
a
dozen
at
the
gangway
if
you
dropped
a
on

devilish
fine
for
you
but
devilish
dull
for
us
in
due

the
drums
beat
the
retreat
and
the
company
scattered
over
the
decks
some
of
the
officers
now
assumed
the
part
of
cicerones
to
show
the
distinguished
strangers
the
bowels
of
the
frigate
concerning
which
several
of
them
showed
a
good
deal
of
intelligent
curiosity
a
guard
of
honour
detached
from
the
marine
corps
accompanied
them
and
they
made
the
circuit
of
the
where
at
a
judicious
distance
the
emperor
peeped
down
into
the
a
very
subterranean
vault
the
captain
of
the
who
there
presided
made
a
polite
bow
in
the
twilight
and
respectfully
expressed
a
desire
for
his
royal
majesty
to
step
down
and
honour
him
with
a
call
but
with
his
handkerchief
to
his
imperial
nose
his
majesty
declined
the
party
then
commenced
the
ascent
to
the
which
from
so
great
a
depth
in
a
frigate
is
something
like
getting
up
to
the
top
of
bunker
hill
monument
from
the
basement
while
a
crowd
of
people
was
gathered
about
the
forward
part
of
the
booms
a
sudden
cry
was
heard
from
below
a
lieutenant
came
running
forward
to
learn
the
cause
when
an
old
standing
by
after
touching
his
hat
hitched
up
his
waistbands
and
replied
know
sir
but
thinking
as
how
one
them
kings
has
been
down
the
and
something
like
this
it
turned
out
in
ascending
one
of
the
narrow
ladders
leading
from
the
to
the
the
most
noble
marquis
of
silva
in
the
act
of
elevating
the
imperial
so
as
to
protect
them
from
rubbing
against
the
combings
of
the
hatchway
this
noble
sword
being
an
uncommonly
long
one
had
caught
between
his
legs
and
tripped
him
head
over
heels
down
into
the
ides
where
are
you
going
said
his
royal
master
tranquilly
peeping
down
toward
the
falling
marquis
what
did
you
let
go
of
my
for
he
suddenly
added
in
a
passion
glancing
round
at
the
same
time
to
see
if
they
had
suffered
from
the
unfaithfulness
of
his
train

the
captain
of

being
assisted
to
the
the
unfortunate
marquis
was
found
to
have
escaped
without
serious
harm
but
from
the
marked
coolness
of
his
royal
master
when
the
marquis
drew
near
to
apologise
for
his
awkwardness
it
was
plain
that
he
was
condemned
to
languish
for
a
time
under
the
royal
displeasure
shortly
after
the
imperial
party
withdrew

another
grand
national
salute

lviii
a
officer
before
the
mast
as
we
were
somewhat
while
we
lay
in
rio
we
received
a
small
draft
of
men
from
a
united
states
sloop
of
war
whose
three
term
of
service
would
expire
about
the
time
of
our
arrival
in
america
under
guard
of
an
armed
lieutenant
and
four
midshipmen
they
came
on
board
in
the
afternoon
they
were
immediately
mustered
in
the
starboard
gangway
that
bridewell
our
first
lieutenant
might
take
down
their
names
and
assign
them
their
stations
they
stood
in
a
mute
and
solemn
row

officer
advanced
with
his
and
pencil

casual
friend
shakings
the
holder
happened
to
be
by
at
the
time
touching
my
arm
he
said
this
here
reminds
me
of
when
a
draft
of
fellows
in
darbies
came
on
from
the
state
prison
at
auburn
for
a
change
of
scene
like
you
know
after
taking
down
four
or
five
names
bridewell
accosted
the
next
man
a
rather
person
but
from
his
haggard
cheek
and
sunken
eye
he
seemed
to
have
been
in
the
sad
habit
all
his
life
of
sitting
up
rather
late
at
night
and
though
all
sailors
do
certainly
keep
late
hours
watches
at
there
is
no
small
difference
between
keeping
late
hours
at
sea
and
keeping
late
hours
ashore
your
name
asked
the
officer
of
this
rather
recruit
sir
said
the
man
courteously
touching
his
cap
must
remember
me
sir
he
added
in
a
low
confidential
tone
strangely
dashed
with
servility
sailed
together
once
in

old
macedonian

i
wore
an
epaulet

we
had

same

your
old
chum

sir
and
he
again
touched
his
cap

an

that
name
said
the
first
lieutenant
emphatically
i
know
fellow
but
i
know
you
henceforth
for
a
common
sailor
i
can
show
no
favouritism
here
if
you
ever
violate
the
rules
you
shall
be
flogged
like
any
other
seaman
i
place
you
in
the
go
forward
to
your
it
seemed
this
mandeville
had
entered
the
navy
when
very
young
and
had
risen
to
be
a
lieutenant
as
he
said
but
brandy
had
been
his
bane
one
night
when
he
had
the
deck
of
a
ship
in
the
mediterranean
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
and
being
out
of
his
senses
for
the
time
went
below
and
turned
into
his
berth
leaving
the
deck
without
a
commanding
officer
for
this
unpardonable
offence
he
was
broken
having
no
fortune
and
no
other
profession
than
the
sea
upon
his
disgrace
he
entered
the
as
a
chief
mate
but
his
love
of
strong
drink
still
pursuing
him
he
was
again
cashiered
at
sea
and
degraded
before
the
mast
by
the
captain
after
this
in
a
state
of
intoxication
he
the
navy
at
pensacola
as
a
common
sailor
but
all
these
lessons
so
to
learn
could
not
cure
him
of
his
sin
he
had
hardly
been
a
week
on
board
the
neversink
when
he
was
found
intoxicated
with
smuggled
spirits
they
lashed
him
to
the
gratings
and
ignominiously
scourged
him
under
the
eye
of
his
old
friend
and
comrade
the
first
lieutenant
this
took
place
while
we
lay
in
port
which
reminds
me
of
the
circumstance
that
when
punishment
is
about
to
be
inflicted
in
harbour
all
strangers
are
ordered
ashore
and
the
sentries
at
the
side
have
it
in
strict
charge
to
waive
off
all
boats
drawing

lix
a
button
divides
two
brothers
the
conduct
of
mandeville
in
claiming
the
acquaintance
of
the
first
lieutenant
under
such
disreputable
circumstances
was
strongly
contrasted
by
the
behaviour
of
another
person
on
board
placed
for
a
time
in
a
somewhat
similar
situation
among
the
genteel
youths
of
the
was
a
lad
of
about
sixteen
a
very
handsome
young
fellow
with
starry
eyes
curly
hair
of
a
golden
colour
and
a
bright
sunshiny
complexion
he
must
have
been
the
son
of
some
goldsmith
he
was
one
of
the
few
in
the
i
used
to
single
out
for
occasional
conversation
after
several
friendly
interviews
he
became
quite
frank
and
communicated
certain
portions
of
his
history
there
is
some
charm
in
the
sea
which
induces
most
persons
to
be
very
communicative
concerning
themselves
we
had
lain
in
rio
but
a
day
when
i
observed
that
this
i
shall
here
call
an
unwonted
expression
of
sadness
mixed
with
apprehension
i
questioned
him
as
to
the
cause
but
he
chose
to
conceal
it
not
three
days
after
he
abruptly
accosted
me
on
the
where
i
happened
to
be
taking
a
promenade
keep
it
to
myself
any
more
he
said
must
have
a
confidant
or
i
shall
go
mad
is
the
matter
said
i
in
alarm
at
this
and
he
handed
me
a
torn
half
sheet
of
an
old
new
york
putting
his
finger
upon
a
particular
word
in
a
particular
paragraph
it
was
the
announcement
of
the
sailing
from
the
brooklyn
of
a
united
states
store
ship
with
provisions
for
the
squadron
in
rio
it
was
upon
a
particular
name
in
the
list
of
officers
and
midshipmen
that
fingers
was
placed
is
my
own
brother
said
he
must
have
got
a
warrant
since
i
left
home
now
to
be
done
i
have
calculated
that
the
store
ship
may
be
expected
here
every
day
my
brother
will
then
see
an
officer
and
i
a
miserable
sailor
that
any
moment
may
be
flogged
at
the
gangway
before
his
very
eyes
heavens
what
shall
i
do
would
you
run
do
you
think
there
is
any
chance
to
desert
i
see
him
by
heaven
with
this
frock
on
and
he
with
the
anchor
button
frank
said
i
do
not
really
see
sufficient
cause
for
this
fit
you
are
in
your
brother
is
an
of
good
and
you
are
nothing
but
a
that
is
no
disgrace
if
he
comes
on
board
here
go
up
to
him
and
take
him
by
the
hand
believe
me
he
will
be
glad
enough
to
see
you
frank
started
from
his
desponding
attitude
and
fixing
his
eyes
full
upon
mine
with
clasped
hands
exclaimed
i
have
been
from
home
nearly
three
years
in
that
time
i
have
never
heard
one
word
from
my
family
and
though
god
knows
how
i
love
them
yet
i
swear
to
you
that
though
my
brother
can
tell
me
whether
my
sisters
are
still
alive
yet
rather
than
accost
him
in
this
i
would
go
ten
centuries
without
hearing
one
syllable
from
home
amazed
at
his
earnestness
and
hardly
able
to
account
for
it
altogether
i
stood
silent
a
moment
then
said
frank
this
midshipman
is
your
own
brother
you
say
now
do
you
really
think
that
your
own
flesh
and
blood
is
going
to
give
himself
airs
over
you
simply
because
he
sports
large
brass
buttons
on
his
coat
never
believe
it
if
he
does
he
can
be
no
brother
and
ought
to
be
all
say
that
again
said
frank
resentfully
brother
is
a
fellow
i
love
him
as
i
do
myself
you
understand
me
you
see
that
when
my
brother
arrives
he
must
consort
more
or
less
with
our
reefers
on
board
here
that
miss
nancy
of
a
stribbles
who
the
other
day
when
mad
back
was
turned
ordered
me
to
hand
him
the
as
if
he
were
a
commodore
do
you
suppose
now
i
want
my
brother
to
see
me
a
lackey
abroad
here
by
heaven
it
is
enough
to
drive
one
distracted
to
be
done
he
cried
fiercely
much
more
passed
between
us
but
all
my
philosophy
was
in
vain
and
at
last
frank
departed
his
head
hanging
down
in
despondency
for
several
days
after
whenever
the
reported
a
sail
entering
the
harbour
frank
was
foremost
in
the
rigging
to
observe
it
at
length
one
afternoon
a
vessel
drawing
near
was
reported
to
be
the
store
ship
i
looked
round
for
frank
on
the
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
must
have
been
below
gazing
out
of
a
the
vessel
was
hailed
from
our
poop
and
came
to
anchor
within
a
toss
of
our
batteries
that
evening
i
heard
that
frank
had
ineffectually
endeavoured
to
get
removed
from
his
place
as
an
oarsman
in
the
boat
which
from
its
size
is
generally
employed
with
the
launch
in
carrying
when
i
thought
that
the
very
next
day
perhaps
this
boat
would
be
plying
between
the
store
ship
and
our
frigate
i
was
at
no
loss
to
account
for
attempts
to
get
rid
of
his
oar
and
felt
heartily
grieved
at
their
failure
next
morning
the
bugler
called
away
the
crew
and
frank
entered
the
boat
with
his
hat
slouched
over
his
eyes
upon
his
return
i
was
all
eagerness
to
learn
what
had
happened
and
as
the
communication
of
his
feelings
was
a
grateful
relief
he
poured
his
whole
story
into
my
ear
it
seemed
that
with
his
comrades
he
mounted
the
store
side
and
hurried
forward
to
the
forecastle
then
turning
anxiously
toward
the
he
spied
two
midshipmen
leaning
against
the
bulwarks
conversing
one
was
the
officer
of
his
the
other
his
brother
no
he
was
too
large
thank
heaven
it
was
not
him
and
perhaps
his
brother
had
not
sailed
from
home
after
all
there
might
have
been
some
mistake
but
suddenly
the
strange
midshipman
laughed
aloud
and
that
laugh
frank
had
heard
a
thousand
times
before
it
was
a
free
hearty
laugh
but
it
carried
a
pang
to
the
heart
of
poor
frank
he
was
now
ordered
down
to
the
to
assist
in
removing
the
stores
the
boat
being
loaded
he
was
ordered
into
her
when
looking
toward
the
gangway
he
perceived
the
two
midshipmen
lounging
upon
each
side
of
it
so
that
no
one
could
pass
them
without
brushing
their
persons
but
again
pulling
his
hat
over
his
eyes
frank
darting
between
them
gained
his
oar
my
heart
thumped
he
said
i
actually
felt
him
so
near
me
but
i
look
at
have
died
first
to
great
relief
the
store
ship
at
last
moved
further
up
the
bay
and
it
fortunately
happened
that
he
saw
no
more
of
his
brother
while
in
rio
and
while
there
he
never
in
any
way
made
himself
known
to
him
chapter

a
shot
at
there
was
a
seaman
belonging
to
the
though
not
a
of
mine
and
no
favourite
of
the
for
certain
venial
transgressions
had
been
prohibited
from
going
ashore
on
liberty
when
the
company
went
enraged
at
the
he
had
not
touched
earth
in
upward
of
a
some
nights
after
lowered
himself
overboard
with
the
view
of
gaining
a
canoe
attached
by
a
rope
to
a
dutch
galiot
some
distant
in
this
canoe
he
proposed
paddling
himself
ashore
not
being
a
very
expert
swimmer
the
commotion
he
made
in
the
water
attracted
the
ear
of
the
sentry
on
that
side
of
the
ship
who
turning
about
in
his
walk
perceived
the
faint
white
spot
where
the
fugitive
was
swimming
in
the
shadow
he
hailed
it
but
no
reply
the
word
or
i
fire
not
a
word
was
heard
the
next
instant
there
was
a
red
flash
and
before
it
had
completely
ceased
illuminating
the
night
the
white
spot
was
changed
into
crimson
some
of
the
officers
returning
from
a
party
at
the
beach
of
the
flamingoes
happened
to
be
drawing
near
the
ship
in
one
of
her
cutters
they
saw
the
flash
and
the
bounding
body
it
revealed
in
a
moment
the
topman
was
dragged
into
the
boat
a
handkerchief
was
used
for
a
tourniquet
and
the
wounded
fugitive
was
soon
on
board
the
frigate
when
the
surgeon
being
called
the
necessary
attentions
were
rendered
now
it
appeared
that
at
the
moment
the
sentry
fired
the
order
to
elude
discovery
by
manifesting
the
completest
floating
on
the
water
straight
and
horizontal
as
if
reposing
on
a
bed
as
he
was
not
far
from
the
ship
at
the
time
and
the
sentry
was
considerably
elevated
above
his
platform
on
a
level
with
the
upper
part
of
the
ball
struck
with
great
force
with
a
downward
obliquity
entering
the
right
thigh
just
above
the
knee
and
penetrating
some
inches
glanced
upward
along
the
bone
burying
itself
somewhere
so
that
it
could
not
be
felt
by
outward
manipulation
there
was
no
dusky
discoloration
to
mark
its
internal
track
as
in
the
case
when
a
entering
the
skin
courses
on
just
beneath
the
surface
without
penetrating
further
nor
was
there
any
mark
on
the
opposite
part
of
the
thigh
to
denote
its
place
as
when
a
ball
forces
itself
straight
through
a
limb
and
lodges
perhaps
close
to
the
skin
on
the
other
side
nothing
was
visible
but
a
small
ragged
puncture
bluish
about
the
edges
as
if
the
rough
point
of
a
tenpenny
nail
had
been
forced
into
the
flesh
and
withdrawn
it
seemed
almost
impossible
that
through
so
small
an
aperture
a
could
have
penetrated
the
extreme
misery
and
general
prostration
of
the
man
caused
by
the
great
effusion
of
strange
to
say
at
first
he
said
he
felt
no
pain
from
the
wound
the
surgeon
very
reluctantly
to
forego
an
immediate
search
for
the
ball
to
extract
it
as
that
would
have
involved
the
dilating
of
the
wound
by
the
knife
an
operation
which
at
that
juncture
would
have
been
almost
certainly
attended
with
fatal
results
a
day
or
two
therefore
was
permitted
to
pass
while
simple
dressings
were
applied
the
surgeon
of
the
other
american
ships
of
war
in
harbour
occasionally
visited
the
neversink
to
examine
the
patient
and
incidentally
to
listen
to
the
expositions
of
our
own
surgeon
their
senior
in
rank
but
cadwallader
cuticle
who
as
yet
has
been
but
incidentally
alluded
to
now
deserves
a
chapter
by
himself
chapter
lxi
the
surgeon
of
the
fleet
cadwallader
cuticle
and
honorary
member
of
the
most
distinguished
colleges
of
surgeons
both
in
europe
and
america
was
our
surgeon
of
the
fleet
nor
was
he
at
all
blind
to
the
dignity
of
his
position
to
which
indeed
he
was
rendered
peculiarly
competent
if
the
reputation
he
enjoyed
was
deserved
he
had
the
name
of
being
the
foremost
surgeon
in
the
navy
a
gentleman
of
remarkable
science
and
a
veteran
practitioner
he
was
a
small
withered
man
nearly
perhaps
quite
sixty
years
of
age
his
chest
was
shallow
his
shoulders
bent
his
pantaloons
hung
round
skeleton
legs
and
his
face
was
singularly
attenuated
in
truth
the
corporeal
vitality
of
this
man
seemed
in
a
good
degree
to
have
died
out
of
him
he
walked
abroad
a
curious
of
life
and
death
with
a
wig
one
glass
eye
and
a
set
of
false
teeth
while
his
voice
was
husky
and
thick
but
his
mind
seemed
undebilitated
as
in
youth
it
shone
out
of
his
remaining
eye
with
basilisk
brilliancy
like
most
old
physicians
and
surgeons
who
have
seen
much
service
and
have
been
promoted
to
high
professional
place
for
their
scientific
attainments
this
cuticle
was
an
enthusiast
in
his
calling
in
private
he
had
once
been
heard
to
say
confidentially
that
he
would
rather
cut
off
a
arm
than
dismember
the
wing
of
the
most
delicate
pheasant
in
particular
the
department
of
morbid
anatomy
was
his
peculiar
love
and
in
his
below
he
had
a
most
unsightly
collection
of
parisian
casts
in
plaster
and
wax
representing
all
imaginable
malformations
of
the
human
members
both
organic
and
induced
by
disease
chief
among
these
was
a
cast
often
to
be
met
with
in
the
anatomical
museums
of
europe
and
no
doubt
an
unexaggerated
copy
of
a
genuine
original
it
was
the
head
of
an
elderly
woman
with
an
aspect
singularly
gentle
and
meek
but
at
the
same
time
wonderfully
expressive
of
a
gnawing
sorrow
never
to
be
relieved
you
would
almost
have
thought
it
the
face
of
some
abbess
for
some
unspeakable
crime
voluntarily
sequestered
from
human
society
and
leading
a
life
of
agonised
penitence
without
hope
so
marvellously
sad
and
tearfully
pitiable
was
this
head
but
when
you
first
beheld
it
no
such
emotions
ever
crossed
your
mind
all
your
eyes
and
all
your
horrified
soul
were
fast
fascinated
and
frozen
by
the
sight
of
a
hideous
crumpled
horn
like
that
of
a
ram
downward
growing
out
from
the
forehead
and
partly
shadowing
the
face
but
as
you
gazed
the
freezing
fascination
of
its
horribleness
gradually
waned
and
then
your
whole
heart
burst
with
sorrow
as
you
contemplated
those
aged
features
ashy
pale
and
wan
the
horn
seemed
the
mark
of
a
curse
for
some
mysterious
sin
conceived
and
committed
before
the
spirit
had
entered
the
flesh
yet
that
sin
seemed
something
imposed
and
not
voluntarily
sought
some
sin
growing
out
of
the
heartless
necessities
of
the
predestination
of
things
some
sin
under
which
the
sinner
sank
in
sinless
woe
but
no
pang
of
pain
not
the
slightest
touch
of
concern
ever
crossed
the
bosom
of
cuticle
when
he
looked
on
this
cast
it
was
immovably
fixed
to
a
bracket
against
the
partition
of
his
so
that
it
was
the
first
object
that
greeted
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
from
his
nightly
sleep
nor
was
it
to
hide
the
face
that
upon
retiring
he
always
hung
his
navy
cap
upon
the
upward
curling
extremity
of
the
horn
for
that
obscured
it
but
little
the
the
lad
who
made
up
his
swinging
bed
and
took
care
of
his
room
often
told
us
of
the
horror
he
sometimes
felt
when
he
would
find
himself
alone
in
his
retreat
at
times
he
was
seized
with
the
idea
that
cuticle
was
a
preternatural
being
and
once
entering
his
room
in
the
middle
watch
of
the
night
he
started
at
finding
it
enveloped
in
a
thick
bluish
vapour
and
stifling
with
the
odours
of
brimstone
upon
hearing
a
low
groan
from
the
smoke
with
a
wild
cry
he
darted
from
the
place
and
rousing
the
occupants
of
the
neighbouring
it
was
found
that
the
vapour
proceeded
from
smouldering
bunches
of
lucifer
matches
which
had
become
ignited
through
the
carelessness
of
the
surgeon
cuticle
almost
dead
was
dragged
from
the
suffocating
atmosphere
and
it
was
several
days
ere
he
completely
recovered
from
its
effects
this
accident
took
place
immediately
over
the
powder
magazine
but
as
cuticle
during
his
sickness
paid
dearly
enough
for
transgressing
the
laws
prohibiting
combustibles
in
the
the
captain
contented
himself
with
privately
remonstrating
with
him
well
knowing
the
enthusiasm
of
the
surgeon
for
all
specimens
of
morbid
anatomy
some
of
the
officers
used
to
play
upon
his
credulity
though
in
every
case
cuticle
was
not
long
in
discovering
their
deceptions
once
when
they
had
some
sago
pudding
for
dinner
and
cuticle
chanced
to
be
ashore
they
made
up
a
neat
parcel
of
this
firm
preparation
and
placing
it
in
a
tin
box
carefully
sealed
with
wax
they
deposited
it
on
the
table
with
a
note
purporting
to
come
from
an
eminent
physician
in
rio
connected
with
the
grand
national
museum
on
the
praca
acclamacao
begging
leave
to
present
the
scientific
senhor
the
uncommonly
fine
specimen
of
a
cancer
descending
to
the
cuticle
spied
the
note
and
no
sooner
read
it
than
clutching
the
case
he
opened
it
and
exclaimed
splendid
i
have
never
seen
a
finer
specimen
of
this
most
interesting
have
you
there
surgeon
cuticle
said
a
lieutenant
advancing
sir
look
at
it
did
you
ever
see
anything
more
exquisite
exquisite
indeed
let
me
have
a
bit
of
it
will
you
cuticle
you
have
a
bit
of
it
shrieked
the
surgeon
starting
back
you
have
one
of
my
limbs
i
mar
so
large
a
specimen
for
a
hundred
dollars
but
what
can
you
want
of
it
you
are
not
making
collections
fond
of
the
article
said
the
lieutenant
a
fine
cold
relish
to
bacon
or
ham
you
know
i
was
in
new
zealand
last
cruise
cuticle
and
got
into
sad
dissipation
there
among
the
cannibals
come
have
a
bit
if
only
a
you
infernal
feejee
shouted
cuticle
eyeing
the
other
with
a
confounded
expression
really
mean
to
eat
a
piece
of
this
cancer
it
to
me
and
see
whether
i
will
not
was
the
reply
name
take
it
cried
the
surgeon
putting
the
case
into
his
hands
and
then
standing
with
his
own
uplifted
cried
the
lieutenant
i
always
use
plenty
of
pepper
with
this
dish
surgeon
oystery
ah
this
is
really
delicious
he
added
smacking
his
lips
over
a
mouthful
it
now
surgeon
and
never
keep
such
a
fine
dish
as
this
lying
uneaten
on
your
hands
as
a
mere
scientific
whole
countenance
changed
and
slowly
walking
up
to
the
table
he
put
his
nose
close
to
the
tin
case
then
touched
its
contents
with
his
finger
and
tasted
it
enough
buttoning
up
his
coat
in
all
the
tremblings
of
an
old
rage
he
burst
from
the
and
calling
for
a
boat
was
not
seen
again
for
hours
but
though
like
all
other
mortals
cuticle
was
subject
at
times
to
these
fits
of
least
under
outrageous
could
exceed
his
coolness
when
actually
employed
in
his
imminent
vocation
surrounded
by
moans
and
shrieks
by
features
distorted
with
anguish
inflicted
by
himself
he
yet
maintained
a
countenance
almost
supernaturally
calm
and
unless
the
intense
interest
of
the
operation
flushed
his
wan
face
with
a
momentary
tinge
of
professional
enthusiasm
he
toiled
away
untouched
by
the
keenest
misery
coming
under
a
eye
indeed
long
habituation
to
the
and
the
had
made
him
seemingly
impervious
to
the
ordinary
emotions
of
humanity
yet
you
could
not
say
that
cuticle
was
essentially
a
man
his
apparent
heartlessness
must
have
been
of
a
purely
scientific
origin
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
even
that
cuticle
would
have
harmed
a
fly
unless
he
could
procure
a
microscope
powerful
enough
to
assist
him
in
experimenting
on
the
minute
vitals
of
the
creature
but
notwithstanding
his
marvellous
indifference
to
the
sufferings
of
his
patients
and
spite
even
of
his
enthusiasm
in
his
cooled
by
frosting
old
age
on
some
occasions
would
effect
a
certain
disrelish
of
his
profession
and
declaim
against
the
necessity
that
forced
a
man
of
his
humanity
to
perform
a
surgical
operation
especially
was
it
apt
to
be
thus
with
him
when
the
case
was
one
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
in
discussing
it
previous
to
setting
about
it
he
would
veil
his
eagerness
under
an
aspect
of
great
circumspection
curiously
marred
however
by
continual
sallies
of
unsuppressible
impatience
but
the
knife
once
in
his
hand
the
compassionless
surgeon

undisguised

a
consultation

surgeons
it
seems
customary
for
the
surgeon
of
the

when
any
important
operation
in
his
department
is
on
the
anvil
and
there
is
nothing
to
absorb
professional
attention
from
it
to
invite
his

to

were
requested
to
visit
the
neversink
in
a
body
to
advise
concerning
the
case
of
the
whose
situation
had
now
become
critical
they
assembled
on
the
and
were
soon
joined
by
their
respected
senior
cuticle
in
a
body
they
bowed
as
he
approached
and
accosted
him
with
deferential
regard
said
cuticle
unostentatiously
seating
himself
on
a
handed
him
by
his
have
here
an
extremely
interesting
case
you
have
all
seen
the
patient
i
believe
at
first
i
had
hopes
that
i
should
have
been
able
to
cut
down
to
the
ball
and
remove
it
but
the
state
of
the
patient
forbade
since
then
the
inflammation
and
sloughing
of
the
part
has
been
attended
with
a
copious
suppuration
great
loss
of
substance
extreme
debility
and
emaciation
from
this
i
am
convinced
that
the
ball
has
shattered
and
deadened
the
bone
and
now
lies
impacted
in
the
medullary
canal
in
fact
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
wound
is
incurable
and
that
amputation
is
the
only
resource
but
gentlemen
i
find
myself
placed
in
a
very
delicate
predicament
i
assure
you
i
feel
no
professional
anxiety
to
perform
the
operation
i
desire
your
advice
and
if
you
will
now
again
visit
the
patient
with
me
we
can
then
return
here
and
decide
what
is
best
to
be
done
once
more
let
me
say
that
i
feel
no
personal
anxiety
whatever
to
use
the
the
assembled
surgeons
listened
to
this
address
with
the
most
serious
attention
and
in
accordance
with
their
desire
now
descended
to
the
where
the
patient
was
languishing
the
examination
concluded
they
returned
to
the
and
the
consultation
was
renewed
began
cuticle
again
seating
himself
have
now
just
inspected
the
limb
you
have
seen
that
there
is
no
resource
but
amputation
and
now
gentlemen
what
do
you
say
surgeon
bandage
of
the
mohawk
will
you
express
your
opinion
wound
is
a
very
serious
one
said
corpulent
man
with
a
high
german
his
head
solemnly
anything
save
him
but
amputation
demanded
cuticle
constitutional
debility
is
extreme
observed
bandage
i
have
seen
more
dangerous
wedge
of
the
malay
said
cuticle
in
a
pet
pleased
to
give
opinion
and
let
it
be
definitive
i
entreat
this
was
said
with
a
severe
glance
toward
bandage
i
thought
began
wedge
a
very
spare
tall
man
elevating
himself
still
higher
on
his
toes
the
ball
had
shattered
and
divided
the
whole
including
the
and
the
the
and
the
i
should
certainly
be
in
favour
of
amputation
but
that
sir
permit
me
to
observe
is
not
my
sawyer
of
the
buccaneer
said
cuticle
drawing
in
his
thin
lower
lip
with
vexation
and
turning
to
a
florid
frank
man
whose
uniform
coat
very
handsomely
fitted
him
and
was
adorned
with
an
unusual
quantity
of
gold
lace
sawyer
of
the
buccaneer
let
us
now
hear
opinion
if
you
please
is
not
amputation
the
only
resource
sir
me
said
sawyer
am
decidedly
opposed
to
it
for
if
hitherto
the
patient
has
not
been
strong
enough
to
undergo
the
extraction
of
the
ball
i
do
not
see
how
he
can
be
expected
to
endure
a
far
more
severe
operation
as
there
is
no
immediate
danger
of
mortification
and
you
say
the
ball
can
not
be
reached
without
making
large
incisions
i
should
support
him
i
think
for
the
present
with
tonics
and
gentle
antiphlogistics
locally
applied
on
no
account
would
i
proceed
to
amputation
until
further
symptoms
are
patella
of
the
algerine
said
cuticle
in
an
passion
abruptly
turning
round
on
the
person
addressed
have
the
kindness
to
say
whether
do
not
think
that
amputation
is
the
only
resource
now
patella
was
the
youngest
of
the
company
a
modest
man
filled
with
a
profound
reverence
for
the
science
of
cuticle
and
desirous
of
gaining
his
good
opinion
yet
not
wishing
to
commit
himself
altogether
by
a
decided
reply
though
like
surgeon
sawyer
in
his
own
mind
he
might
have
been
clearly
against
the
operation
you
have
remarked
mr
surgeon
of
the
fleet
said
patella
respectfully
hemming
the
dangerous
condition
of
the
limb
seems
obvious
enough
amputation
would
certainly
be
a
cure
to
the
wound
but
then
as
notwithstanding
his
present
debility
the
patient
seems
to
have
a
strong
constitution
he
might
rally
as
it
is
and
by
your
scientific
treatment
mr
surgeon
of
the
entirely
made
whole
without
risking
an
amputation
still
it
is
a
very
critical
case
and
amputation
may
be
indispensable
and
if
it
is
to
be
performed
there
ought
to
be
no
delay
whatever
that
is
my
view
of
the
case
mr
surgeon
of
the
patella
then
gentlemen
said
cuticle
turning
round
triumphantly
clearly
of
opinion
that
amputation
should
be
immediately
performed
for
my
own
i
mean
and
without
respect
to
the
am
sorry
to
have
it
so
decided
but
this
settles
the
question
my
own
mind
however
it
was
settled
before
at
ten
morning
the
operation
will
be
performed
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
you
all
on
the
occasion
and
also
your
alluding
to
the
absent
gentlemen
at
ten
and
cuticle
retreated
to
the
chapter
lxiii
the
operation
next
morning
at
the
appointed
hour
the
surgeons
arrived
in
a
body
they
were
accompanied
by
their
juniors
young
men
ranging
in
age
from
nineteen
years
to
thirty
like
the
senior
surgeons
these
young
gentlemen
were
arrayed
in
their
blue
navy
uniforms
displaying
a
profusion
of
bright
buttons
and
several
broad
bars
of
gold
lace
about
the
wristbands
as
in
honour
of
the
occasion
they
had
put
on
their
best
coats
they
looked
exceedingly
brilliant
the
whole
party
immediately
descended
to
the
where
preparations
had
been
made
for
the
operation
a
large
was
stretched
across
the
ship
by
the
so
as
completely
to
screen
the
space
behind
this
space
included
the
whole
extent
aft
to
the
of
the
cabin
at
the
door
of
which
the
paced
in
plain
sight
cutlass
in
hand
upon
two
dragged
amidships
the
used
for
burials
at
sea
was
horizontally
placed
covered
with
an
old
upon
this
occasion
to
do
duty
as
an
it
was
widened
by
an
additional
plank
two
near
by
placed
one
upon
another
at
either
end
supported
another
plank
distinct
from
the
table
whereon
was
exhibited
an
array
of
saws
and
knives
of
various
and
peculiar
shapes
and
sizes
also
a
sort
of
steel
something
like
the
implement
together
with
long
needles
crooked
at
the
end
for
taking
up
the
arteries
and
large
thread
and
for
sewing
up
a
wound
at
the
end
nearest
the
larger
table
was
a
tin
basin
of
water
surrounded
by
small
sponges
placed
at
mathematical
intervals
from
the
long
horizontal
pole
of
a
in
its
usual
place
a
number
of
towels
with
marked
in
the
corners
all
these
arrangements
had
been
made
by
the
steward
a
person
whose
important
functions
in
a
will
in
a
future
chapter
be
entered
upon
at
large
upon
the
present
occasion
he
was
bustling
about
adjusting
and
readjusting
the
knives
needles
and
carver
like
an
butler
fidgeting
over
a
just
before
the
convivialists
enter
but
by
far
the
most
striking
object
to
be
seen
behind
the
ensign
was
a
human
skeleton
whose
every
joint
articulated
with
wires
by
a
rivet
at
the
apex
of
the
skull
it
hung
dangling
from
a
fixed
in
a
beam
above
why
this
object
was
here
will
presently
be
seen
but
why
it
was
placed
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
only
surgeon
cuticle
can
tell
while
the
final
preparations
were
being
made
cuticle
stood
conversing
with
the
assembled
surgeons
and
assistant
surgeons
his
invited
guests
said
he
taking
up
one
of
the
glittering
knives
and
artistically
drawing
the
steel
across
it
though
these
scenes
are
very
unpleasant
and
in
some
moods
i
may
say
repulsive
to
how
much
better
for
our
patient
to
have
the
contusions
and
lacerations
of
his
present
all
its
dangerous
into
a
clean
incision
free
from
these
objections
and
occasioning
so
much
less
subsequent
anxiety
to
himself
and
the
surgeon
yes
he
added
tenderly
feeling
the
edge
of
his
knife
is
our
only
resource
is
it
not
so
surgeon
patella
turning
toward
that
gentleman
as
if
relying
upon
some
sort
of
an
assent
however
clogged
with
conditions
said
patella
is
your
only
resource
mr
surgeon
of
the
fleet
that
is
i
mean
if
you
are
fully
persuaded
of
its
the
other
surgeons
said
nothing
maintaining
a
somewhat
reserved
air
as
if
conscious
that
they
had
no
positive
authority
in
the
case
whatever
might
be
their
own
private
opinions
but
they
seemed
willing
to
behold
and
if
called
upon
to
assist
at
the
operation
since
it
could
not
now
be
averted
the
young
men
their
assistants
looked
very
eager
and
cast
frequent
glances
of
awe
upon
so
distinguished
a
practitioner
as
the
venerable
cuticle
say
he
can
drop
a
leg
in
one
minute
and
ten
seconds
from
the
moment
the
knife
touches
it
whispered
one
of
them
to
another
shall
see
was
the
reply
and
the
speaker
clapped
his
hand
to
his
fob
to
see
if
his
watch
would
be
forthcoming
when
wanted
you
all
ready
here
demanded
cuticle
now
advancing
to
his
steward
not
those
fellows
got
through
yet
pointing
to
three
men
of
the
gang
who
were
placing
bits
of
wood
under
the
supporting
the
central
table
are
just
through
sir
respectfully
answered
the
steward
touching
his
hand
to
his
forehead
as
if
there
were
a
there
up
the
patient
then
said
cuticle
gentlemen
he
added
turning
to
the
row
of
assistant
surgeons
you
here
reminds
me
of
the
classes
of
students
once
under
my
instruction
at
the
philadelphia
college
of
physicians
and
surgeons
ah
those
were
happy
days
he
sighed
applying
the
extreme
corner
of
his
handkerchief
to
his
an
old
emotions
young
gentlemen
but
when
i
think
of
the
numerous
rare
cases
that
then
came
under
my
treatment
i
can
not
but
give
way
to
my
feelings
the
town
the
city
the
metropolis
young
gentlemen
is
the
place
for
you
students
at
least
in
these
dull
times
of
peace
when
the
army
and
navy
furnish
no
inducements
for
a
youth
ambitious
of
rising
in
our
honourable
profession
take
an
old
advice
and
if
the
war
now
threatening
between
the
states
and
mexico
should
break
out
exchange
your
navy
commissions
for
commissions
in
the
army
from
having
no
military
marine
herself
mexico
has
always
been
backward
in
furnishing
subjects
for
the
of
foreign
navies
the
cause
of
science
has
languished
in
her
hands
the
army
young
gentlemen
is
your
best
school
depend
upon
it
you
will
hardly
believe
it
surgeon
bandage
turning
to
that
gentleman
this
is
my
first
important
case
of
surgery
in
a
nearly
three
cruise
i
have
been
almost
wholly
confined
in
this
ship
to
practice
prescribing
for
fevers
and
fluxes
true
the
other
day
a
man
fell
from
the
but
that
was
merely
an
aggravated
case
of
dislocations
and
bones
splintered
and
broken
no
one
sir
could
have
made
an
amputation
of
it
without
severely
contusing
his
conscience
and
may
say
it
gentlemen
without
ostentation
and
so
saying
the
knife
and
carver
touchingly
dropped
to
his
sides
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
fixed
in
a
tender
reverie
but
a
commotion
being
heard
beyond
the
curtain
he
started
and
briskly
crossing
and
recrossing
the
knife
and
carver
exclaimed
here
comes
our
patient
surgeons
this
side
of
the
table
if
you
please
young
gentlemen
a
little
further
off
i
beg
steward
take
off
my
my
neckerchief
now
i
must
be
perfectly
unencumbered
surgeon
patella
or
i
can
do
nothing
these
articles
being
removed
he
snatched
off
his
wig
placing
it
on
the
capstan
then
took
out
his
set
of
false
teeth
and
placed
it
by
the
side
of
the
wig
and
lastly
putting
his
forefinger
to
the
inner
angle
of
his
blind
eye
spirited
out
the
glass
optic
with
professional
dexterity
and
deposited
that
also
next
to
the
wig
and
false
teeth
thus
divested
of
nearly
all
inorganic
appurtenances
what
was
left
of
the
surgeon
slightly
shook
itself
to
see
whether
anything
more
could
be
spared
to
advantage
mates
he
now
cried
you
never
get
through
with
that
job
through
through
they
replied
staring
round
in
search
of
the
strange
unearthly
voice
that
addressed
them
for
the
absence
of
his
teeth
had
not
at
all
improved
the
conversational
tones
of
the
surgeon
of
the
fleet
with
natural
curiosity
these
men
had
purposely
been
lingering
to
see
all
they
could
but
now
having
no
further
excuse
they
snatched
up
their
hammers
and
chisels
the
decamping
from
a
public
meeting
at
the
eleventh
hour
after
just
completing
the
rostrum
in
time
for
the
first
gang
withdrew
the
broad
ensign
now
lifted
revealing
a
glimpse
of
the
crowd
of
outside
and
the
patient
borne
in
the
arms
of
two
of
his
entered
the
place
he
was
much
emaciated
weak
as
an
infant
and
every
limb
visibly
trembled
or
rather
jarred
like
the
head
of
a
man
with
the
palsy
as
if
an
organic
and
involuntary
apprehension
of
death
had
seized
the
wounded
leg
its
nervous
motions
were
so
violent
that
one
of
the
was
obliged
to
keep
his
hand
upon
it
the
was
immediately
stretched
upon
the
table
the
attendants
steadying
his
limbs
when
slowly
opening
his
eyes
he
glanced
about
at
the
glittering
knives
and
saws
the
towels
and
sponges
the
armed
sentry
at
the
the
row
of
students
the
meagre
of
a
cuticle
now
with
his
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
upon
his
withered
arms
and
knife
in
hand
and
finally
his
eyes
settled
in
horror
upon
the
skeleton
slowly
vibrating
and
jingling
before
him
with
the
slow
slight
roll
of
the
frigate
in
the
water
would
advise
perfect
repose
of
your
every
limb
my
man
said
cuticle
addressing
him
precision
of
an
operation
is
often
impaired
by
the
inconsiderate
restlessness
of
the
patient
but
if
you
consider
my
good
fellow
he
added
in
a
patronising
and
almost
sympathetic
tone
and
slightly
pressing
his
hand
on
the
limb
you
consider
how
much
better
it
is
to
live
with
three
limbs
than
to
die
with
four
and
especially
if
you
but
knew
to
what
torments
both
sailors
and
soldiers
were
subjected
before
the
time
of
celsus
owing
to
the
lamentable
ignorance
of
surgery
then
prevailing
you
would
certainly
thank
god
from
the
bottom
of
your
heart
that
operation
has
been
postponed
to
the
period
of
this
enlightened
age
blessed
with
a
bell
a
brodie
and
a
lally
my
man
before
time
such
was
the
general
ignorance
of
our
noble
science
that
in
order
to
prevent
the
excessive
effusion
of
blood
it
was
deemed
indispensable
to
operate
with
a
a
professional
movement
toward
the
pour
scalding
oil
upon
the
his
elbow
as
if
with
a
in
his
further
to
sear
them
after
amputation
had
been
is
fainting
said
one
of
his
some
water
the
steward
immediately
hurried
to
the
with
the
basin
cuticle
took
the
by
the
wrist
and
feeling
it
a
while
observed
be
alarmed
men
addressing
the
two
recover
presently
this
fainting
very
generally
takes
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
tranquilly
eyeing
the
patient
now
the
surgeon
of
the
fleet
and
the
presented
a
spectacle
which
to
a
reflecting
mind
was
better
than
a
sermon
on
the
mortality
of
man
here
was
a
sailor
who
four
days
previous
had
stood
pillar
of
an
arm
like
a
and
a
thigh
like
a
windlass
but
the
slightest
conceivable
of
a
bit
of
crooked
trigger
had
eventuated
in
stretching
him
out
more
helpless
than
an
babe
with
a
blasted
thigh
utterly
drained
of
its
brawn
and
who
was
it
that
now
stood
over
him
like
a
superior
being
and
as
if
clothed
himself
with
the
attributes
of
immortality
indifferently
discoursed
of
carving
up
his
broken
flesh
and
thus
piecing
out
his
abbreviated
days
who
was
it
that
in
capacity
of
surgeon
seemed
enacting
the
part
of
a
regenerator
of
life
the
withered
shrunken
toothless
hairless
cuticle
with
a
trunk
half
to
behold
and
while
in
those
and
premonitions
of
speedy
death
which
almost
invariably
accompany
a
severe
wound
even
with
the
most
intrepid
spirits
while
thus
drooping
and
dying
this
once
robust
eye
was
now
waning
in
his
head
like
a
lapland
moon
being
eclipsed
in
who
for
years
had
still
lived
in
his
withered
tabernacle
of
a
no
doubt
sharing
in
the
common
of
old
must
have
felt
his
hold
of
life
as
secure
as
the
grim
hug
of
a
grizzly
bear
verily
life
is
more
awful
than
death
and
let
no
man
though
his
live
heart
beat
in
him
like
a
him
not
hug
his
life
to
himself
for
in
the
predestinated
necessities
of
things
that
bounding
life
of
his
is
not
a
whit
more
secure
than
the
life
of
a
man
on
his
we
inhale
the
air
with
expanding
lungs
and
life
runs
through
us
like
a
thousand
niles
but
we
may
collapse
in
death
and
all
our
veins
be
dry
as
the

in
a
drought
now
young
gentlemen
said
cuticle
turning
to
the
assistant
surgeons
the
patient
is
coming
to
permit
me
to
describe
to
you
the
operation
i
am
about
to
surgeon
of
the
fleet
said
surgeon
bandage
you
are
about
to
lecture
permit
me
to
present
you
with
your
teeth
they
will
make
your
discourse
more
readily
and
so
saying
bandage
with
a
bow
placed
the
two
semicircles
of
ivory
into
hands
you
surgeon
bandage
said
cuticle
and
slipped
the
ivory
into
its
place
the
first
place
now
young
gentlemen
let
me
direct
your
attention
to
the
excellent
preparation
before
you
i
have
had
it
unpacked
from
its
case
and
set
up
here
from
my
where
it
occupies
the
spare
berth
and
all
this
for
your
express
benefit
young
gentlemen
this
skeleton
i
procured
in
person
from
the
hunterian
department
of
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
in
london
it
is
a
masterpiece
of
art
but
we
have
no
time
to
examine
it
now
delicacy
forbids
that
i
should
amplify
at
a
juncture
like
an
almost
benignant
glance
toward
the
patient
now
beginning
to
open
his
eyes
let
me
point
out
to
you
upon
this
it
from
the
skeleton
with
a
gentle
precise
place
where
i
propose
to
perform
the
operation
young
gentlemen
is
the
place
you
perceive
it
is
very
near
the
point
of
articulation
with
the
interposed
surgeon
wedge
rising
on
his
toes
young
gentlemen
the
point
of
articulation
with
the
of
the
your
bell
on
bones
dick
whispered
one
of
the
assistants
to
the
student
next
him
has
been
spending
the
whole
morning
over
it
getting
out
the
hard
wedge
said
cuticle
looking
round
severely
will
dispense
with
your
commentaries
if
you
please
at
present
now
young
gentlemen
you
can
not
but
perceive
that
the
point
of
operation
being
so
near
the
trunk
and
the
vitals
it
becomes
an
unusually
beautiful
one
demanding
a
steady
hand
and
a
true
eye
and
after
all
the
patient
may
die
under
my
steward
water
water
fainting
again
cried
the
two
be
alarmed
for
your
comrade
men
said
cuticle
turning
round
tell
you
it
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
the
patient
to
betray
some
emotion
upon
these
usually
manifested
by
swooning
it
is
quite
natural
it
should
be
so
but
we
must
not
delay
the
operation
steward
that
the
next
it
he
is
coming
to
i
the
wrist
you
all
ready
sir
this
last
observation
was
addressed
to
one
of
the
assistant
surgeons
a
tall
lank
cadaverous
young
man
arrayed
in
a
sort
of
shroud
of
white
canvas
pinned
about
his
throat
and
completely
enveloping
his
person
he
was
seated
on
a
skeleton
swinging
near
his
the
foot
of
the
table
in
readiness
to
grasp
the
limb
as
when
a
plank
is
being
severed
by
a
carpenter
and
his
apprentice
sponges
steward
said
cuticle
for
the
last
time
taking
out
his
teeth
and
drawing
up
his
shirt
sleeves
still
further
then
taking
the
patient
by
the
wrist
by
now
you
keep
hold
of
his
arms
pin
him
down
steward
put
your
hand
on
the
artery
i
shall
commence
as
soon
as
his
pulse
begins
now
letting
fall
the
wrist
feeling
the
thigh
carefully
and
bowing
over
it
an
instant
he
drew
the
fatal
knife
unerringly
across
the
flesh
as
it
first
touched
the
part
the
row
of
surgeons
simultaneously
dropped
their
eyes
to
the
watches
in
their
hands
while
the
patient
lay
with
eyes
horribly
distended
in
a
kind
of
waking
trance
not
a
breath
was
heard
but
as
the
quivering
flesh
parted
in
a
long
lingering
gash
a
spring
of
blood
welled
up
between
the
living
walls
of
the
wounds
and
two
thick
streams
in
opposite
directions
coursed
down
the
thigh
the
sponges
were
instantly
dipped
in
the
purple
pool
every
face
present
was
pinched
to
a
point
with
suspense
the
limb
writhed
the
man
shrieked
his
pinioned
him
while
round
and
round
the
leg
went
the
unpitying
cut
saw
said
cuticle
instantly
it
was
in
his
hand
full
of
the
operation
he
was
about
to
apply
it
when
looking
up
and
turning
to
the
assistant
surgeons
he
said
any
of
you
young
gentlemen
like
to
apply
the
saw
a
splendid
subject
several
volunteered
when
selecting
one
cuticle
surrendered
the
instrument
to
him
saying
be
hurried
now
be
while
the
rest
of
the
assistants
looked
upon
their
comrade
with
glances
of
envy
he
went
rather
timidly
to
work
and
cuticle
who
was
earnestly
regarding
him
suddenly
snatched
the
saw
from
his
hand
butcher
you
disgrace
the
profession
look
at
for
a
few
moments
the
thrilling
rasping
sound
was
heard
and
then
the
seemed
parted
in
twain
at
the
hip
as
the
leg
slowly
slid
into
the
arms
of
the
pale
gaunt
man
in
the
shroud
who
at
once
made
away
with
it
and
tucked
it
out
of
sight
under
one
of
the
guns

now
said
cuticle
courteously
turning
to
the
surgeon
of
the
mohawk
you
like
to
take
up
the
arteries
they
are
quite
at
your
service
sawyer
be
prevailed
upon
said
surgeon

sawyer
complied
and
while
with
some
modesty
he
was
conducting
the
operation
cuticle
turning
to
the
row
of
assistants
said
gentlemen
we
will
now
proceed
with
our
illustration
hand
me
that
bone
and
taking
the
in
his
still
bloody
hands
and
holding
it
conspicuously
before
his
auditors
the
surgeon
of
the
fleet
began
gentlemen
you
will
perceive
that
precisely
at
this
which
i
previously
directed
your
the
corresponding
spot
operation
has
been
performed
about
here
young
gentlemen
his
hand
some
inches
from
the
the
great
artery
was
but
you
noticed
that
i
did
not
use
the
tourniquet
i
never
do
the
forefinger
of
my
steward
is
far
better
than
a
tourniquet
being
so
much
more
manageable
and
leaving
the
smaller
veins
uncompressed
but
i
have
been
told
young
gentlemen
that
a
certain
seignior
seignioroni
a
surgeon
of
seville
has
recently
invented
an
admirable
substitute
for
the
clumsy
tourniquet
as
i
understand
it
it
is
something
like
a
pair
of
working
with
a
small
archimedes
very
clever
invention
according
to
all
accounts
for
the
padded
points
at
the
end
of
the
his
forefinger
and
be
so
worked
as
to
approximate
in
such
a
way
as
you
attend
to
me
young
gentlemen
he
added
all
at
once
starting
being
more
interested
in
the
active
proceedings
of
surgeon
sawyer
who
was
now
threading
a
needle
to
sew
up
the
overlapping
of
the
stump
the
young
gentlemen
had
not
scrupled
to
turn
away
their
attention
altogether
from
the
lecturer
a
few
moments
more
and
the
in
a
swoon
was
removed
below
into
the
as
the
curtain
settled
again
after
the
patient
had
disappeared
cuticle
still
holding
the
of
the
skeleton
in
his
ensanguined
hands
proceeded
with
his
remarks
upon
it
and
having
concluded
them
added
young
gentlemen
not
the
least
interesting
consequence
of
this
operation
will
be
the
finding
of
the
ball
which
in
case
of
might
have
long
eluded
the
most
careful
search
that
ball
young
gentlemen
must
have
taken
a
most
circuitous
route
nor
in
cases
where
the
direction
is
oblique
is
this
at
all
unusual
indeed
the
learned
henner
gives
us
a
most
had
almost
said
an
of
a
neck
where
the
bullet

the
part

elevating
himself
the
point
called

severely
emphasising
the
last
two
words
completely
round
the
neck
and
emerging
at
the
same
hole
it
had
entered
shot
the
next
man
in
the
ranks
it
was
afterward
extracted
says
renner
from
the
second
man
and
pieces
of
the
skin
were
found
adhering
to
it
but
examples
of
foreign
substances
being
received
into
the
body
with
a
ball
young
gentlemen
are
frequently
observed
being
attached
to
a
united
states
ship
at
the
time
i
happened
to
be
near
the
spot
of
the
battle
of
ayacucho
in
peru
the
day
after
the
action
i
saw
in
the
barracks
of
the
wounded
a
trooper
who
having
been
severely
injured
in
the
brain
went
crazy
and
with
his
own
committed
suicide
in
the
hospital
the
ball
drove
inward
a
portion
of
his
woollen
the
form
of
a
doubtless
said
the
undaunted
wedge
once
surgeon
wedge
you
use
the
only
term
that
can
be
employed
and
let
me
avail
myself
of
this
opportunity
to
say
to
you
young
gentlemen
that
a
man
of
true
his
shallow
chest
a
but
few
hard
words
and
those
only
when
none
other
will
answer
his
purpose
whereas
the
smatterer
in
glancing
toward
that
by
mouthing
hard
words
he
proves
that
he
understands
hard
things
let
this
sink
deep
in
your
minds
young
gentlemen
and
surgeon
wedge
a
stiff
me
to
submit
the
reflection
to
yourself
well
young
gentlemen
the
bullet
was
afterward
extracted
by
pulling
upon
the
external
parts
of
the
simple
but
exceedingly
beautiful
operation
there
is
a
fine
example
somewhat
similar
related
in
guthrie
but
of
course
you
must
have
met
with
it
in
so
a
work
as
his
treatise
upon
wounds
when
upward
of
twenty
years
ago
i
was
with
lord
cochrane
then

of

the
blockade

his
but
by
this
time
the
fidgets
had
completely
taken
possession
of
his
auditors
especially
of
the
senior
surgeons
and
turning
upon
them
abruptly
he
added
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
round
upon
all
the
dinners
must
be
waiting
you
on
board
your
respective
ships
but
surgeon
sawyer
perhaps
you
may
desire
to
wash
your
hands
before
you
go
there
is
the
basin
sir
you
will
find
a
clean
towel
on
the
rammer
for
myself
i
seldom
use
out
his
handkerchief
must
leave
you
now
at
ten
the
limb
will
be
upon
the
table
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
you
all
upon
the
occasion
there
turning
to
the
curtain
which
then
rustled
sir
said
the
steward
entering

also
gentlemen
at

precisely
said
cuticle
once
more
turning
round
upon
his
guests
predicted
that
the
operation
might
prove
fatal
he
was
very
much
run
down
and
cuticle
departed
does
not
surely
mean
to
touch
the
body
exclaimed
surgeon
sawyer
with
much
excitement
no
said
patella
only
his
way
he
means
doubtless
that
it
may
be
inspected
previous
to
being
taken
ashore

remains

in

of

when
the
second
cutter
pulled
about
among
the
ships
dropping
the
surgeons
aboard
the
american
here
and
a
distributes
her
pilots
at
the
mouth
of
the
passed
several
foreign
frigates
two
of
which
an
englishman
and
a
frenchman
had
excited
not
a
little
remark
on
board
the
neversink
these
vessels
often
loosed
their
sails
and
exercised
yards
simultaneously
with
ourselves
as
if
desirous
of
comparing
the
respective
efficiency
of
the
crews
when
we
were
nearly
ready
for
sea
the
english
frigate
weighing
her
anchor
made
all
sail
with
the
and
began
showing
off
her
paces
by
gliding
about
among
all
the
in
harbour
and
particularly
by
running
down
under
the
stern
every
time
she
drew
near
we
complimented
her
by
lowering
our
ensign
a
little
and
invariably
she
courteously
returned
the
salute
she
was
inviting
us
to
a
and
it
was
rumoured
that
when
we
should
leave
the
bay
our
captain
would
have
no
objections
to
gratify
her
for
be
it
known
the
neversink
was
accounted
the
fleetest
keeled
craft
sailing
under
the
american
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
why
the
stranger
challenged
us
it
may
have
been
that
a
portion
of
our
crew
were
the
more
anxious
to
race
with
this
frigate
from
a
little
circumstance
which
a
few
of
them
deemed
rather
galling
not
many
distant
from
our
cabin
lay
the
frigate
president
with
the
red
cross
of
george
flying
from
her
peak
as
its
name
imported
this
fine
craft
was
an
american
born
but
having
been
captured
during
the
last
war
with
britain
she
now
sailed
the
salt
seas
as
a
trophy
think
of
it
my
gallant
countrymen
one
and
all
down
the
and
along
the
endless
banks
of
the
ohio
and
of
the
twinges
we
must
have
felt
to
behold
the
of
the
floridas
and
the
pines
of
green
maine
built
into
the
oaken
walls
of
old
england
but
to
some
of
the
sailors
there
was
a
counterbalancing
thought
as
grateful
as
the
other
was
galling
and
that
was
that
somewhere
sailing
under
the
stars
and
stripes
was
the
frigate
macedonian
a
craft
which
had
once
sported
the
of
britain
it
has
ever
been
the
custom
to
spend
almost
any
amount
of
money
in
repairing
a
captured
vessel
in
order
that
she
may
long
survive
to
commemorate
the
heroism
of
the
conqueror
thus
in
the
english
navy
there
are
many
monsieurs
of
won
from
the
gaul
but
we
americans
can
show
but
few
similar
trophies
though
no
doubt
we
would
much
like
to
be
able
so
to
do
but
i
never
have
beheld
any
of
thee
floating
trophies
without
being
reminded
of
a
scene
once
witnessed
in
a
pioneer
village
on
the
western
bank
of
the
mississippi
not
far
from
this
village
where
the
stumps
of
aboriginal
trees
yet
stand
in
the
some
years
ago
lived
a
portion
of
the
remnant
tribes
of
the
sioux
indians
who
frequently
visited
the
white
settlements
to
purchase
trinkets
and
cloths
one
florid
crimson
evening
in
july
when
the
sun
was
going
down
in
a
blaze
and
i
was
leaning
against
a
corner
in
my
frock
lo
there
came
stalking
out
of
the
crimson
west
a
gigantic
erect
as
a
pine
with
his
glittering
tomahawk
big
as
a
folded
in
martial
repose
across
his
chest
moodily
wrapped
in
his
blanket
and
striding
like
a
king
on
the
stage
he
promenaded
up
and
down
the
rustic
streets
exhibiting
on
the
back
of
his
blanket
a
crowd
of
human
hands
rudely
delineated
in
red
one
of
them
seemed
recently
drawn
is
this
warrior
asked
i
why
marches
he
here
and
for
what
are
these
bloody
hands
warrior
is
the
said
a
pioneer
in
moccasins
by
my
side
marches
here
to
his
last
trophy
every
one
of
those
hands
attests
a
foe
scalped
by
his
tomahawk
and
he
has
just
emerged
from
ben
the
painter
who
has
sketched
the
last
red
hand
that
you
see
for
last
night
this
outburned
the
the
chief
of
a
band
of
the
poor
savage
thought
i
and
is
this
the
cause
of
your
lofty
gait
do
you
straighten
yourself
to
think
that
you
have
committed
a
murder
when
a
stone
has
often
done
the
same
is
it
a
proud
thing
to
topple
down
six
feet
perpendicular
of
immortal
manhood
though
that
lofty
living
tower
needed
perhaps
thirty
good
growing
summers
to
bring
it
to
maturity
poor
savage
and
you
account
it
so
glorious
do
you
to
mutilate
and
destroy
what
god
himself
was
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
building
and
yet
what
is
the
american
frigate

chapter
lxv
a
race
we
lay
in
rio
so
what
reason
the
commodore
only
a
saying
went
abroad
among
the
impatient
sailors
that
our
frigate
would
at
last
ground
on
the
daily
thrown
overboard
by
the
cooks
but
at
last
good
tidings
came
hands
up
anchor
ahoy
and
bright
and
early
in
the
morning
up
came
our
old
iron
as
the
sun
rose
in
the
east
the
at
which
alone
vessels
may
emerge
from
the
ever
languid
and
faint
it
comes
from
gardens
of
citrons
and
cloves
spiced
with
all
the
spices
of
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
like
that
old
exquisite
mohammed
who
so
much
loved
to
snuff
perfumes
and
essences
and
used
to
lounge
out
of
the
conservatories
of
khadija
his
wife
to
give
battle
to
the
robust
sons
of
koriesh
even
so
this
rio
comes
jaded
with
savours
to
wrestle
with
the
wild
tartar
breezes
of
the
sea
slowly
we
dropped
and
dropped
down
the
bay
glided
like
a
stately
swan
through
the
outlet
and
were
gradually
rolled
by
the
smooth
sliding
billows
broad
out
upon
the
deep
straight
in
our
wake
came
the
tall
of
the
english
terminating
like
a
steepled
cathedral
in
the
bannered
cross
of
the
religion
of
peace
and
straight
after
came
the
rainbow
banner
of
france
sporting
token
that
no
more
would
he
make
war
on
the
earth
both
englishmen
and
frenchmen
were
resolved
upon
a
race
and
we
yankees
swore
by
our
and
royals
to
sink
their
blazing
banners
that
night
among
the
southern
constellations
we
should
daily
be
extinguishing
behind
us
in
our
run
to
the
north
said
mad
jack
banner
shall
be
as
the
out
of
sight
leagues
down
the
horizon
while
our
gallant
stars
my
brave
boys
shall
burn
all
alone
in
the
north
like
the
great
bear
at
the
pole
come
on
rainbow
and
cross
but
the
wind
was
long
languid
and
faint
not
yet
recovered
from
its
dissipation
ashore
and
noon
advanced
with
the
pinnacle
in
sight
now
it
is
not
with
ships
as
with
horses
for
though
if
a
horse
walk
well
and
fast
it
generally
furnishes
good
token
that
he
is
not
bad
at
a
gallop
yet
the
ship
that
in
a
light
breeze
is
outstripped
may
sweep
the
stakes
so
soon
as
a
breeze
enables
her
to
strike
into
a
canter
thus
fared
it
with
us
first
the
englishman
glided
ahead
and
bluffly
passed
on
then
the
frenchman
politely
bade
us
adieu
while
the
old
neversink
lingered
behind
railing
at
the
effeminate
breeze
at
one
time
all
three
frigates
were
irregularly
abreast
forming
a
diagonal
line
and
so
near
were
all
three
that
the
stately
officers
on
the
poops
stiffly
saluted
by
touching
their
caps
though
refraining
from
any
further
civilities
at
this
juncture
it
was
a
noble
sight
to
behold
those
fine
frigates
with
dripping
all
rearing
and
nodding
in
concert
and
to
look
through
their
tall
spars
and
wilderness
of
rigging
that
seemed
like
gigantic
cobwebs
against
the
sky
toward
sundown
the
ocean
pawed
its
white
hoofs
to
the
spur
of
its
rider
a
strong
blast
from
the
eastward
and
giving
three
cheers
from
decks
yards
and
tops
we
crowded
all
sail
on
george
and
denis
but
it
is
harder
to
overtake
than
outstrip
night
fell
upon
us
still
in
the
where
the
little
boat
was
which
at
the
eleventh
hour
according
to
a
rabbinical
tradition
pushed
after
the
ark
of
old
noah
it
was
a
misty
cloudy
night
and
though
at
first
our
kept
the
chase
in
dim
sight
yet
at
last
so
thick
became
the
atmosphere
that
no
sign
of
a
strange
spar
was
to
be
seen
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
when
last
discerned
the
frenchman
was
broad
on
our
and
the
englishman
gallantly
leading
his
van
the
breeze
blew
fresher
and
fresher
but
with
even
our
set
we
dashed
along
through
a
ocean
of
illuminated
foam
was
then
in
the
top
and
it
was
glorious
to
look
down
and
see
our
black
hull
butting
the
white
sea
with
its
broad
bows
like
a
ram
must
beat
them
with
such
a
breeze
dear
jack
said
i
to
our
noble
captain
of
the
top
the
same
breeze
blows
for
john
bull
remember
replied
jack
who
being
a
briton
perhaps
favoured
the
englishman
more
than
the
neversink
how
we
boom
through
the
billows
cried
jack
gazing
over
the
then
flinging
forth
his
arm
recited
and
gliding
on
the
leeward
side
the
bounding
vessel
cuts
the
roaring
camoens
camoens
did
you
ever
read
him
the
lusiad
i
mean
the
epic
of
the
world
my
lad
give
me
gama
for
a
commodore
say
gama
and
mickle
did
you
ever
read
of
him
william
julius
mickle
translator
a
disappointed
man
though
besides
his
version
of
the
lusiad
he
wrote
many
forgotten
things
did
you
ever
see
his
ballad
of
cumnor
hall
it
gave
sir
walter
scott
the
hint
of
kenilworth
my
father
knew
mickle
when
he
went
to
sea
on
board
the
old
romney
how
many
great
men
have
been
sailors
they
say
homer
himself
was
once
a
tar
even
as
his
hero
ulysses
was
both
a
sailor
and
a
shipwright
swear
shakspeare
was
once
a
captain
of
the
forecastle
do
you
mind
the
first
scene
in
and
the
christopher
columbus
was
a
sailor
and
so
was
camoens
who
went
to
sea
with
gama
else
we
had
never
had
the
lusiad
yes
sailed
over
the
very
track
that
camoens
the
east
cape
into
the
indian
ocean
been
in
don
garden
too
in
macao
and
bathed
my
feet
in
the
blessed
dew
of
the
walks
where
camoens
wandered
before
me
yes
and
i
have
seen
and
sat
in
the
cave
at
the
end
of
the
flowery
winding
way
where
camoens
according
to
tradition
composed
certain
parts
of
his
lusiad
ay
camoens
was
a
sailor
once
then
falconer
whose
will
never
founder
though
he
himself
poor
fellow
was
lost
at
sea
in
the
aurora
frigate
old
noah
was
the
first
sailor
and
paul
too
knew
how
to
box
the
compass
my
lad
mind
you
that
chapter
in
acts
i
spin
the
yarn
better
myself
were
you
ever
in
malta
they
called
it
melita
in
the
day
i
have
been
in
cave
there
they
say
a
piece
of
it
is
good
for
a
charm
against
shipwreck
but
i
never
tried
it
shelley
he
was
quite
a
sailor
lad
a
percy
they
ought
to
have
let
him
sleep
in
his
was
drowned
in
the
mediterranean
you
know
near
not
burn
his
body
as
they
did
as
if
he
had
been
a
bloody
turk
but
many
people
thought
him
so
because
he
go
to
mass
and
because
he
wrote
queen
mab
trelawney
was
by
at
the
burning
and
he
was
an
too
ay
and
byron
helped
put
a
piece
of
a
keel
on
the
fire
for
it
was
made
of
bits
of
a
wreck
they
say
one
wreck
burning
another
and
was
not
byron
a
sailor
an
amateur
so
he
was
else
how
bid
the
ocean
heave
and
fall
in
that
grand
majestic
way
i
say
mind
me
there
never
was
a
very
great
man
yet
who
spent
all
his
life
inland
a
snuff
of
the
sea
my
boy
is
inspiration
and
having
been
once
out
of
sight
of
land
has
been
the
making
of
many
a
true
poet
and
the
blasting
of
many
pretenders
for
see
no
gammon
about
the
ocean
it
knocks
the
false
keel
right
off
a
bows
it
tells
him
just
what
he
is
and
makes
him
feel
it
too
a
life
i
say
is
the
thing
to
bring
us
mortals
out
what
does
the
blessed
bible
say
it
say
that
we
alone
see
the
marvellous
sights
and
wonders
deny
the
blessed
bible
now
do
it
how
it
rocks
up
here
my
boy
holding
on
to
a
shroud
it
only
proves
what
been
sea
is
the
place
to
cradle
genius
heave
and
fall
old
sea
also
noble
jack
said
i
are
you
but
a
sailor
merry
my
boy
said
jack
looking
up
with
a
glance
like
that
of
a
sentimental
archangel
doomed
to
drag
out
his
eternity
in
disgrace
mind
you
there
are
many
great
men
in
the
world
besides
commodores
and
captains
that
here
his
under
happier
in
you
solitary
star
there
peeping
down
from
those
have
made
a
homer
of
me
but
fate
is
fate
and
we
homers
who
happen
to
be
captains
of
tops
must
write
our
odes
in
our
hearts
and
publish
them
in
our
heads
but
look
the
on
the
it
was
now
midnight
but
all
the
officers
were
on
deck
there
cried
the
lieutenant
of
the
watch
going
forward
and
hailing
the
headmost
see
anything
of
those
fellows
now
nothing
nothing
sir
said
the
lieutenant
approaching
the
captain
and
touching
his
cap
all
hands
roared
the
captain
keel
be
beat
while
i
stride
all
hands
were
called
and
the
hammocks
stowed
in
the
nettings
for
the
rest
of
the
night
so
that
no
one
could
lie
between
blankets
now
in
order
to
explain
the
means
adopted
by
the
captain
to
insure
us
the
race
it
needs
to
be
said
of
the
neversink
that
for
some
years
after
being
launched
she
was
accounted
one
of
the
slowest
vessels
in
the
american
navy
but
it
chanced
upon
a
time
that
being
on
a
cruise
in
the
mediterranean
she
happened
to
sail
out
of
port
mahon
in
what
was
then
supposed
to
be
very
bad
trim
for
the
sea
her
bows
were
rooting
in
the
water
and
her
stern
kicking
up
its
heels
in
the
air
but
wonderful
to
tell
it
was
soon
discovered
that
in
this
comical
posture
she
sailed
like
a
she
outstripped
every
vessel
on
the
station
thenceforward
all
her
captains
on
all
cruises
her
by
the
head
and
the
neversink
gained
the
name
of
a
clipper
to
return
all
hands
being
called
they
were
now
made
use
of
by
captain
claret
as
to
trim
the
ship
scientifically
to
her
most
approved
bearings
some
were
sent
forward
on
the
with
shot
in
their
hands
and
were
judiciously
scattered
about
here
and
there
with
strict
orders
not
to
budge
an
inch
from
their
stations
for
fear
of
marring
the
plans
others
were
distributed
along
the
gun
and
with
similar
orders
and
to
crown
all
several
carronade
guns
were
unshipped
from
their
carriages
and
swung
in
their
breechings
from
the
beams
of
the
so
as
to
impart
a
sort
of
vibratory
briskness
and
oscillating
buoyancy
to
the
frigate
and
thus
we
five
hundred
stood
out
that
whole
night
some
of
us
exposed
to
a
drenching
rain
in
order
that
the
neversink
might
not
be
beaten
but
the
comfort
and
consolation
of
all
is
as
dust
in
the
balance
in
the
estimation
of
the
rulers
of
our
world
the
long
anxious
night
at
last
came
to
an
end
and
with
the
first
peep
of
day
the
on
the
was
hailed
but
nothing
was
in
sight
at
last
it
was
broad
day
yet
still
not
a
bow
was
to
be
seen
in
our
rear
nor
a
stern
in
our
van
are
they
cried
the
captain
of
sight
astern
to
be
sure
sir
said
the
officer
of
the
deck
of
sight
to
be
sure
sir
muttered
jack
chase
in
the
top
precisely
thus
stood
the
question
whether
we
beat
them
or
whether
they
beat
us
no
mortal
can
tell
to
this
hour
since
we
never
saw
them
again
but
for
one
will
lay
his
two
hands
on
the
bow
chasers
of
the
neversink
and
take
his
oath
that
we
yankees
carried
the
day
chapter
lxvi
fun
in
a
after
the
race
our
derby
we
had
many
days
fine
weather
during
which
we
continued
running
before
the
trades
toward
the
north
exhilarated
by
the
thought
of
being
many
of
the
seamen
became
joyous
and
the
discipline
of
the
ship
if
anything
became
a
little
relaxed
many
pastimes
served
to
while
away
the
in
particular
these
embracing
two
hours
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
form
the
only
authorised
for
the
crews
of
most
ships
at
sea
among
other
diversions
at
present
licensed
by
authority
in
the
neversink
were
those
of
sparring
and
all
these
were
under
the
direct
patronage
of
the
captain
the
consequences
they
sometimes
led
would
undoubtedly
have
been
strictly
prohibited
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
when
a
navy
captain
does
not
happen
to
be
an
admirer
of
the
his
crew
seldom
amuse
themselves
in
that
way
as
every
one
knows
is
a
delightful
pastime
which
consists
in
two
men
standing
a
few
feet
apart
and
rapping
each
other
over
the
head
with
long
poles
there
is
a
good
deal
of
fun
in
it
so
long
as
you
are
not
hit
but
a
the
judgment
of
discreet
the
sport
completely
when
this
pastime
is
practiced
by
connoisseurs
ashore
they
wear
heavy
wired
helmets
to
break
the
force
of
the
blows
but
the
only
helmets
of
our
tars
were
those
with
which
nature
had
furnished
them
they
played
with
great
consists
in
playing
with
bone
poles
instead
of
wooden
ones
two
men
stand
apart
and
pommel
each
other
with
their
fists
a
hard
bunch
of
knuckles
permanently
attached
to
the
arms
and
made
globular
or
extended
into
a
palm
at
the
pleasure
of
the
proprietor
till
one
of
them
finding
himself
sufficiently
thrashed

thus
practised
by
amateurs

taken
up
by

arms
and
legs
and

against

base

in
two
negroes
whites
will
not
answer
butting
at
each
other
like
rams
this
pastime
was
an
especial
favourite
with
the
captain
in
the
and
were
repeatedly
summoned
into
the
lee
waist
to
tilt
at
each
other
for
the
benefit
of
the
health
was
a
so
the
sailors
called
him
with
a
skull
like
an
iron
wherefore
much
fancied
the
sport
but
he
was
a
slender
and
rather
handsome
mulatto
and
abhorred
the
pastime
nevertheless
the
captain
must
be
obeyed
so
at
the
word
poor
was
fain
to
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defence
else
would
incontinently
have
bumped
him
out
of
a
into
the
sea
i
used
to
pity
poor
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
my
pity
was
almost
aroused
into
indignation
at
a
sad
sequel
to
one
of
these
gladiatorial
scenes
it
seems
that
lifted
up
by
the
unaffected
though
verbally
unexpressed
applause
of
the
captain
had
begun
to
despise
as
a
fellow
all
brains
and
no
skull
whereas
he
himself
was
a
great
warrior
all
skull
and
no
brains
accordingly
after
they
had
been
bumping
one
evening
to
the
content
confidentially
told
that
he
considered
him
a
which
among
some
blacks
is
held
a
great
term
of
reproach
fired
at
the
insult
gave
to
understand
that
he
utterly
erred
for
his
mother
a
black
slave
had
been
one
of
the
mistresses
of
a
virginia
planter
belonging
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
that
state
another
insulting
remark
followed
this
innocent
disclosure
retort

retort
in
a
word
at
last
they
came
together
in
mortal
combat
the
caught
them
in
the
act
and
brought
them
up
to
the
mast
the
captain
advanced

flogged
both

the
most
impartial
manner
as
in
the
matter
of
the
scene
at
the
gangway
shortly
after
the
cape
horn
theatricals
when
my
attention
had
been
directed
to
the
fact
that
the
officers
had
their
that
occasion
i
say
it
was
seen
with
what
facility
a
assumes
his
wonted
severity
of
demeanour
after
a
casual
relaxation
of
it
this
was
especially
the
case
with
captain
claret
upon
the
present
occasion
for
any
landsman
to
have
beheld
him
in
the
lee
waist
of
a
pleasant
with
a
genial
countenance
observing
the
gladiators
in
the
ring
and
now
and
then
indulging
in
a
playful
landsman
would
have
deemed
captain
claret
the
indulgent
father
of
his
crew
perhaps
permitting
the
excess
of
his
to
encroach
upon
the
appropriate
dignity
of
his
station
he
would
have
deemed
captain
claret
a
fine
illustration
of
those
two
poetical
comparisons
between
a
and
a
father
and
between
a
and
the
master
of
apprentices
instituted
by
those
eminent
maritime
jurists
the
noble
lords
tenterden
and
stowell
but
surely
if
there
is
anything
hateful
it
is
this
of
the
after
wearing
a
merry
and
one
how
can
they
have
the
heart
methinks
if
but
once
i
smiled
upon
a
mind
how
much
beneath
could
not
bring
myself
to
condemn
him
to
the
shocking
misery
of
the
lash
oh
officers
all
round
the
world
if
this
face
you
wear
at
all
then
never
unship
it
for
another
to
be
merely
sported
for
a
moment
of
all
insults
the
temporary
condescension
of
a
master
to
a
slave
is
the
most
outrageous
and
galling
that
potentate
who
most
condescends
mark
him
well
for
that
potentate
if
occasion
come
will
prove
your
uttermost
tyrant
chapter
lxvii
arraigned
at
the
mast
when
with
five
hundred
others
i
made
one
of
the
compelled
spectators
at
the
scourging
of
poor
i
little
thought
what
fate
had
ordained
for
myself
the
next
day
poor
mulatto
thought
i
one
of
an
oppressed
race
they
degrade
you
like
a
hound
thank
god
i
am
a
white
yet
i
had
seen
whites
also
scourged
for
black
or
white
all
my
shipmates
were
liable
to
that
still
there
is
something
in
us
somehow
that
in
the
most
degraded
condition
we
snatch
at
a
chance
to
deceive
ourselves
into
a
fancied
superiority
to
others
whom
we
suppose
lower
in
the
scale
than
ourselves
poor
thought
i
poor
mulatto
heaven
send
you
a
release
from
your
humiliation
to
make
plain
the
thing
about
to
be
related
it
needs
to
repeat
what
has
somewhere
been
previously
mentioned
that
in
every
seaman
in
a
has
a
particular
station
assigned
him
what
that
station
is
should
be
made
known
to
him
by
the
first
lieutenant
and
when
the
word
is
passed
to
or
it
is
every
duty
to
be
found
at
his
post
but
among
the
various
and
given
to
me
by
the
senior
lieutenant
when
i
first
came
on
board
the
frigate
he
had
altogether
omitted
informing
me
of
my
particular
place
at
those
times
and
up
to
the
precise
period
now
written
of
i
had
hardly
known
that
i
should
have
had
any
special
place
then
at
all
for
the
rest
of
the
men
they
seemed
to
me
to
catch
hold
of
the
first
rope
that
offered
as
in
a
upon
similar
occasions
indeed
i
subsequently
discovered
that
such
was
the
state
of
this
one
particular
at
very
few
of
the
seamen
could
tell
where
their
proper
stations
were
at
or
hands
tack
ship
ahoy
such
was
the
announcement
made
by
the
mates
at
the
hatchways
the
morning
after
the
hard
fate
of
it
was
just
eight
and
springing
from
my
white
jacket
which
i
had
spread
between
the
guns
for
a
bed
on
the
i
ran
up
the
ladders
and
as
usual
seized
hold
of
the
which
fifty
hands
were
streaming
along
forward
when
haul
was
given
through
the
trumpet
i
pulled
at
this
brace
with
such
heartiness
and
that
i
almost
flattered
myself
that
my
instrumentality
in
getting
the
frigate
round
on
the
other
tack
deserved
a
public
vote
of
thanks
and
a
silver
tankard
from
congress
but
something
happened
to
be
in
the
way
aloft
when
the
yards
swung
round
a
little
confusion
ensued
and
with
anger
on
his
brow
captain
claret
came
forward
to
see
what
occasioned
it
no
one
to
let
go
the
of
the
the
rope
was
cast
off
however
by
a
hand
and
the
yards
unobstructed
came
round
when
the
last
rope
was
coiled
away
the
captain
desired
to
know
of
the
first
lieutenant
who
it
might
be
that
was
stationed
at
the
weather
then
the
starboard
with
a
vexed
expression
of
countenance
the
first
lieutenant
sent
a
midshipman
for
the
station
bill
when
upon
glancing
it
over
my
own
name
was
found
put
down
at
the
post
in
question
at
the
time
i
was
on
the
below
and
did
not
know
of
these
proceedings
but
a
moment
after
i
heard
the
mates
bawling
my
name
at
all
the
and
along
all
three
decks
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
it
so
sent
through
the
furthest
recesses
of
the
ship
and
well
knowing
what
this
generally
betokened
to
other
seamen
my
heart
jumped
to
my
throat
and
i
hurriedly
asked
flute
the
at
the
what
was
wanted
of
me
wants
ye
at
the
mast
he
replied
to
flog
ye
i
for
eyes
been
chalking
your
face
ye
am
i
wanted
for
i
repeated
but
at
that
instant
my
name
was
again
thundered
forth
by
the
other
mate
and
flute
hurried
me
away
hinting
that
i
would
soon
find
out
what
the
captain
desired
of
me
i
swallowed
down
my
heart
in
me
as
i
touched
the
for
a
single
instant
balanced
myself
on
my
best
centre
and
then
wholly
ignorant
of
what
was
going
to
be
alleged
against
me
advanced
to
the
dread
tribunal
of
the
frigate
as
i
passed
through
the
gangway
i
saw
the
rigging
the
gratings
the
boatswain
with
his
green
bag
of
scourges
the
ready
to
help
off
some
shirt
again
i
made
a
desperate
swallow
of
my
whole
soul
in
me
and
found
myself
standing
before
captain
claret
his
flushed
face
obviously
showed
him
in
among
the
group
of
officers
by
his
side
was
the
first
lieutenant
who
as
i
came
aft
eyed
me
in
such
a
manner
that
i
plainly
perceived
him
to
be
extremely
vexed
at
me
for
having
been
the
innocent
means
of
reflecting
upon
the
manner
in
which
he
kept
up
the
discipline
of
the
ship
were
you
not
at
your
station
sir
asked
the
captain
station
do
you
mean
sir
said
i
it
is
generally
the
custom
with
to
stand
obsequiously
touching
their
hat
at
every
sentence
they
address
to
the
captain
but
as
this
was
not
obligatory
upon
me
by
the
articles
of
war
i
did
not
do
so
upon
the
present
occasion
and
previously
i
had
never
had
the
dangerous
honour
of
a
personal
interview
with
captain
claret
he
quickly
noticed
my
omission
of
the
homage
usually
rendered
him
and
instinct
told
me
that
to
a
certain
extent
it
set
his
heart
against
me
station
sir
do
you
mean
said
i
pretend
ignorance
he
replied
will
not
help
you
glancing
at
the
captain
the
first
lieutenant
now
produced
the
station
bill
and
read
my
name
in
connection
with
that
of
the
starboard
claret
said
i
is
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
of
my
being
assigned
to
that
is
this
bridewell
he
said
turning
to
the
first
lieutenant
with
a
expression
is
impossible
sir
said
that
officer
striving
to
hide
his
vexation
this
man
must
have
known
his
have
never
known
it
before
this
moment
captain
claret
said
i
you
contradict
my
officer
he
returned
shall
flog
i
had
now
been
on
board
the
frigate
upward
of
a
year
and
remained
unscourged
the
ship
was
and
in
a
few
weeks
at
most
i
would
be
a
free
man
and
now
after
making
a
hermit
of
myself
in
some
things
in
order
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
the
scourge
here
it
was
hanging
over
me
for
a
thing
utterly
unforeseen
for
a
crime
of
which
i
was
as
utterly
innocent
but
all
that
was
as
naught
i
saw
that
my
case
was
hopeless
my
solemn
disclaimer
was
thrown
in
my
teeth
and
the
mate
stood
curling
his
fingers
through
the
there
are
times
when
wild
thoughts
enter
a
heart
when
he
seems
almost
irresponsible
for
his
act
and
his
deed
the
captain
stood
on
the
of
the
deck
sideways
on
an
unobstructed
line
with
him
was
the
opening
of
the
where
the
are
suspended
in
port
nothing
but
a
slight
bit
of
served
to
rail
in
this
opening
which
was
cut
right
down
to
the
level
of
the
feet
showing
the
far
sea
beyond
i
stood
a
little
to
windward
of
him
and
though
he
was
a
large
powerful
man
it
was
certain
that
a
sudden
rush
against
him
along
the
slanting
deck
would
infallibly
pitch
him
headforemost
into
the
ocean
though
he
who
so
rushed
must
needs
go
over
with
him
my
blood
seemed
clotting
in
my
veins
i
felt
icy
cold
at
the
tips
of
my
fingers
and
a
dimness
was
before
my
eyes
but
through
that
dimness
the
mate
scourge
in
hand
loomed
like
a
giant
and
captain
claret
and
the
blue
sea
seen
through
the
opening
at
the
gangway
showed
with
an
awful
vividness
i
can
not
analyse
my
heart
though
it
then
stood
still
within
me
but
the
thing
that
swayed
me
to
my
purpose
was
not
altogether
the
thought
that
captain
claret
was
about
to
degrade
me
and
that
i
had
taken
an
oath
with
my
soul
that
he
should
not
no
i
felt
my
manhood
so
bottomless
within
me
that
no
word
no
blow
no
scourge
of
captain
claret
could
cut
me
deep
enough
for
that
i
but
swung
to
an
instinct
in
instinct
diffused
through
all
animated
nature
the
same
that
prompts
even
a
worm
to
turn
under
the
heel
locking
him
i
meant
to
drag
captain
claret
from
this
earthly
tribunal
of
his
to
that
of
jehovah
and
let
him
decide
between
us
no
other
way
could
i
escape
the
scourge
nature
has
not
implanted
any
power
in
man
that
was
not
meant
to
be
exercised
at
times
though
too
often
our
powers
have
been
abused
the
privilege
inborn
and
inalienable
that
every
man
has
of
dying
himself
and
inflicting
death
upon
another
was
not
given
to
us
without
a
purpose
these
are
the
last
resources
of
an
insulted
and
unendurable
existence
the
gratings
sir
said
captain
claret
you
hear
my
eye
was
measuring
the
distance
between
him
and
the
sea
claret
said
a
voice
advancing
from
the
crowd
i
turned
to
see
who
this
might
be
that
audaciously
interposed
at
a
juncture
like
this
it
was
the
same
remarkably
handsome
and
gentlemanly
corporal
of
marines
colbrook
who
has
been
previously
alluded
to
in
the
chapter
describing
killing
time
in
a
know
that
man
said
colbrook
touching
his
cap
and
speaking
in
a
mild
firm
but
extremely
deferential
manner
i
know
that
he
would
not
be
found
absent
from
his
station
if
he
knew
where
it
this
speech
was
almost
unprecedented
seldom
or
never
before
had
a
marine
dared
to
speak
to
the
captain
of
a
frigate
in
behalf
of
a
seaman
at
the
mast
but
there
was
something
so
unostentatiously
commanding
in
the
calm
manner
of
the
man
that
the
captain
though
astounded
did
not
in
any
way
reprimand
him
the
very
unusualness
of
his
interference
seemed
protection
taking
heart
perhaps
from
example
jack
chase
interposed
and
in
a
manly
but
carefully
respectful
manner
in
substance
repeated
the
remark
adding
that
he
had
never
found
me
wanting
in
the
top
the
captain
looked
from
chase
to
colbrook
and
from
colbrook
to
the
foremost
man
among
the
seamen
the
other
the
foremost
man
among
the
all
round
upon
the
packed
and
silent
crew
and
as
if
a
slave
to
fate
though
supreme
captain
of
a
frigate
he
turned
to
the
first
lieutenant
made
some
indifferent
remark
and

me

aft
into
his
cabin
while
i
who
in
the
desperation
of
my
soul
had
but
just
escaped

and
a
suicide
almost

a
few
little
things
pertaining

our

let
nothing
slip
however
small
and
feel
myself
actuated
by
the

trifles

from

and
hardship
and
vice
carry
them
on
an
early
bier
to
the
grave
as
in
the
evening
of
life
and
at
the
close
of
the
day
old
abraham
sat
at
the
door
of
his
tent
biding
his
time
to
die
so
sits
our
old
on
the
of
the
glancing
round
him
with
patriarchal
benignity
and
that
mild
expression
of
his
sets
off
very
strangely
a
face
that
has
been
burned
almost
black
by
the
torrid
suns
that
shone
fifty
years
face
that
is
seamed
with
three
sabre
cuts
you
would
almost
think
this
old
had
been
blown
out
of
vesuvius
to
look
alone
at
his
scarred
blackened
forehead
chin
and
cheeks
but
gaze
down
into
his
eye
and
though
all
the
snows
of
time
have
drifted
higher
and
higher
upon
his
brow
yet
deep
down
in
that
eye
you
behold
an
infantile
sinless
look
the
same
that
answered
the
glance
of
this
old
mother
when
first
she
cried
for
the
babe
to
be
laid
by
her
side
that
look
is
the
fadeless
ever
infantile
immortality
within
the
lord
nelsons
of
the
sea
though
but
barons
in
the
state
yet
oftentimes
prove
more
potent
than
their
royal
masters
and
at
such
scenes
as
this
emperor
and
reinstating
on
the
ocean
the
proud
part
of
mighty
richard
neville
the
earl
of
the
land
and
as
richard
neville
entrenched
himself
in
his
moated
old
castle
of
warwick
which
underground
was
traversed
with
vaults
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
and
intricate
as
the
wards
of
the
old
keys
of
calais
surrendered
to
edward
iii
even
so
do
these
house
themselves
in
their
frigates
oaken
dug
deck
under
deck
as
cell
under
cell
and
as
the
old
warders
of
warwick
every
night
at
curfew
patrolled
the
battlements
and
dove
down
into
the
vaults
to
see
that
all
lights
were
extinguished
even
so
do
the
and
corporals
of
a
frigate
perambulate
all
the
decks
of
a
blowing
out
all
tapers
but
those
burning
in
the
legalized
yea
in
these
things
so
potent
is
the
authority
of
these
that
though
almost
the
lowest
subalterns
in
the
ship
yet
should
they
find
the
senior
lieutenant
himself
sitting
up
late
in
his
reading
navigator
or
gunpowder
and
they
would
infallibly
blow
the
light
out
under
his
very
nose
nor
durst
that
resent
the
indignity
but
unwittingly
i
have
ennobled
by
grand
historical
comparisons
this
prying
pettifogging
of
a
you
have
seen
some
slim
housekeeper
at
midnight
ferreting
over
a
rambling
old
house
in
the
country
startling
at
fancied
witches
and
ghosts
yet
intent
on
seeing
every
door
bolted
every
smouldering
ember
in
the
fireplaces
smothered
every
loitering
domestic
abed
and
every
light
made
dark
this
is
the
taking
his
in
a
frigate
it
may
be
thought
that
but
little
is
seen
of
the
commodore
in
these
chapters
and
that
since
he
so
seldom
appears
on
the
stage
he
can
not
be
so
august
a
personage
after
all
but
the
mightiest
potentates
keep
the
most
behind
the
veil
you
might
tarry
in
constantinople
a
month
and
never
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
sultan
the
grand
lama
of
thibet
according
to
some
accounts
is
never
beheld
by
the
people
but
if
any
one
doubts
the
majesty
of
a
commodore
let
him
know
that
according
to
xlii
of
the
articles
of
war
he
is
invested
with
a
prerogative
which
according
to
monarchical
jurists
is
inseparable
from
the
plenary
pardoning
power
he
may
pardon
all
offences
committed
in
the
squadron
under
his
command
but
this
prerogative
is
only
his
while
at
sea
or
on
a
foreign
station
a
circumstance
peculiarly
significant
of
the
great
difference
between
the
stately
absolutism
of
a
commodore
enthroned
on
his
poop
in
a
foreign
harbour
and
an
unlaced
commodore
negligently
reclining
in
an
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
at
home
chapter
lxix
prayers
at
the
guns
the
or
general
quarters
now
and
then
taking
place
in
our
frigate
have
already
been
described
also
the
sunday
devotions
on
the
but
nothing
has
yet
been
said
concerning
the
daily
morning
and
evening
quarters
when
the
men
silently
stand
at
their
guns
and
the
chaplain
simply
offers
up
a
prayer
let
us
now
enlarge
upon
this
matter
we
have
plenty
of
time
the
occasion
invites
for
behold
the
neversink
bowls
along
over
a
jubilant
sea
shortly
after
breakfast
the
drum
beats
to
quarters
and
among
five
hundred
men
scattered
over
all
three
decks
and
engaged
in
all
manner
of
ways
that
sudden
rolling
march
is
magical
as
the
monitory
sound
to
which
every
good
mussulman
at
sunset
drops
to
the
ground
whatsoever
his
hands
might
have
found
to
do
and
throughout
all
turkey
the
people
in
concert
kneel
toward
their
holy
mecca
the
sailors
run
to
and
up
the
some
gain
their
respective
stations
in
the
shortest
possible
time
in
three
minutes
all
is
composed
one
by
one
the
various
officers
stationed
over
the
separate
divisions
of
the
ship
then
approach
the
first
lieutenant
on
the
and
report
their
respective
men
at
their
quarters
it
is
curious
to
watch
their
countenances
at
this
time
a
profound
silence
prevails
and
emerging
through
the
hatchway
from
one
of
the
lower
decks
a
slender
young
officer
appears
hugging
his
sword
to
his
thigh
and
advances
through
the
long
lanes
of
sailors
at
their
guns
his
serious
eye
all
the
time
fixed
upon
the
first
polar
star
sometimes
he
essays
a
stately
and
graduated
step
an
erect
and
martial
bearing
and
seems
full
of
the
vast
national
importance
of
what
he
is
about
to
communicate
but
when
at
last
he
gains
his
destination
you
are
amazed
to
perceive
that
all
he
has
to
say
is
imparted
by
a
freemason
touch
of
his
cap
and
a
bow
he
then
turns
and
makes
off
to
his
division
perhaps
passing
several
brother
lieutenants
all
bound
on
the
same
errand
he
himself
has
just
achieved
for
about
five
minutes
these
officers
are
coming
and
going
bringing
in
thrilling
intelligence
from
all
quarters
of
the
frigate
most
stoically
received
however
by
the
first
lieutenant
with
his
legs
apart
so
as
to
give
a
broad
foundation
for
the
superstructure
of
his
dignity
this
gentleman
stands
stiff
as
a
on
the
one
hand
holds
his
appurtenance
altogether
unnecessary
at
the
time
and
which
he
accordingly
tucks
point
backward
under
his
arm
like
an
umbrella
on
a
day
the
other
hand
is
continually
bobbing
up
and
down
to
the
leather
front
of
his
cap
in
response
to
the
reports
and
salute
of
his
subordinates
to
whom
he
never
deigns
to
vouchsafe
a
syllable
merely
going
through
the
motions
of
accepting
their
news
without
bestowing
thanks
for
their
pains
this
continual
touching
of
caps
between
officers
on
board
a
is
the
reason
why
you
invariably
notice
that
the
glazed
fronts
of
their
caps
look
jaded
and
worn
sometimes
slightly
in
other
respects
the
cap
may
appear
glossy
and
fresh
but
as
for
the
first
lieutenant
he
ought
to
have
extra
pay
allowed
to
him
on
account
of
his
extraordinary
outlays
in
cap
fronts
for
he
it
is
to
whom
all
day
long
reports
of
various
kinds
are
incessantly
being
made
by
the
junior
lieutenants
and
no
report
is
made
by
them
however
trivial
but
caps
are
touched
on
the
occasion
it
is
obvious
that
these
individual
salutes
must
be
greatly
multiplied
and
aggregated
upon
the
senior
lieutenant
who
must
return
them
all
indeed
when
a
subordinate
officer
is
first
promoted
to
that
rank
he
generally
complains
of
the
same
exhaustion
about
the
shoulder
and
elbow
that
la
fayette
mourned
over
when
in
visiting
america
he
did
little
else
but
shake
the
sturdy
hands
of
patriotic
farmers
from
sunrise
to
sunset
the
various
officers
of
divisions
having
presented
their
respects
and
made
good
their
return
to
their
stations
the
first
lieutenant
turns
round
and
marching
aft
endeavours
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
captain
in
order
to
touch
his
own
cap
to
that
personage
and
thereby
without
adding
a
word
of
explanation
communicate
the
fact
of
all
hands
being
at
their
he
is
a
sort
of
retort
or
to
concentrate
the
whole
sum
of
the
information
imparted
to
him
and
discharge
it
upon
his
superior
at
one
touch
of
his
cap
front
but
sometimes
the
captain
feels
out
of
sorts
or
in
or
is
pleased
to
be
somewhat
capricious
or
has
a
fancy
to
show
a
touch
of
his
omnipotent
supremacy
or
peradventure
it
has
so
happened
that
the
first
lieutenant
has
in
some
way
piqued
or
offended
him
and
he
is
not
unwilling
to
show
a
slight
specimen
of
his
dominion
over
him
even
before
the
eyes
of
all
hands
at
all
events
only
by
some
one
of
these
suppositions
can
the
singular
circumstance
be
accounted
for
that
frequently
captain
claret
would
pertinaciously
promenade
up
and
down
the
poop
purposely
averting
his
eye
from
the
first
lieutenant
who
would
stand
below
in
the
most
awkward
suspense
waiting
the
first
wink
from
his
eye
i
have
him
he
must
have
said
to
himself
as
the
captain
would
turn
toward
him
in
his
walk
my
time
and
up
would
go
his
hand
to
his
cap
but
alas
the
captain
was
off
again
and
the
men
at
the
guns
would
cast
sly
winks
at
each
other
as
the
embarrassed
lieutenant
would
bite
his
lips
with
suppressed
vexation
upon
some
occasions
this
scene
would
be
repeated
several
times
till
at
last
captain
claret
thinking
that
in
the
eyes
of
all
hands
his
dignity
must
by
this
time
be
pretty
well
bolstered
would
stalk
towards
his
subordinate
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
whereupon
up
goes
his
hand
to
the
cap
front
and
the
captain
nodding
his
acceptance
of
the
report
descends
from
his
perch
to
the
by
this
time
the
stately
commodore
slowly
emerges
from
his
cabin
and
soon
stands
leaning
alone
against
the
brass
rails
of
the
in
passing
him
the
captain
makes
a
profound
salutation
which
his
superior
returns
in
token
that
the
captain
is
at
perfect
liberty
to
proceed
with
the
ceremonies
of
the
hour
marching
on
captain
claret
at
last
halts
near
the
at
the
head
of
a
group
of
the
officers
and
by
the
side
of
the
chaplain
at
a
sign
from
his
finger
the
brass
band
strikes
up
the
portuguese
hymn
this
over
from
commodore
to
all
hands
uncover
and
the
chaplain
reads
a
prayer
upon
its
conclusion
the
drum
beats
the
retreat
and
the
company
disappear
from
the
guns
at
sea
or
in
harbour
this
ceremony
is
repeated
every
morning
and
evening
by
those
stationed
on
the
the
chaplain
is
distinctly
heard
but
the
gun
division
embraces
but
a
tenth
part
of
the
company
many
of
whom
are
below
on
the
where
not
one
syllable
of
the
prayer
can
be
heard
this
seemed
a
great
misfortune
for
i
well
knew
myself
how
blessed
and
soothing
it
was
to
mingle
twice
every
day
in
these
peaceful
devotions
and
with
the
commodore
and
captain
and
smallest
boy
unite
in
acknowledging
almighty
god
there
was
also
a
touch
of
the
temporary
equality
of
the
church
about
it
exceedingly
grateful
to
a
like
me
my
happened
to
be
directly
opposite
the
brass
railing
against
which
the
commodore
invariably
leaned
at
prayers
brought
so
close
together
twice
every
day
for
more
than
a
year
we
could
not
but
become
intimately
acquainted
with
each
faces
to
this
fortunate
circumstance
it
is
to
be
ascribed
that
some
time
after
reaching
home
we
were
able
to
recognise
each
other
when
we
chanced
to
meet
in
washington
at
a
ball
given
by
the
russian
minister
the
baron
de
bodisco
and
though
while
on
board
the
frigate
the
commodore
never
in
any
manner
personally
addressed
did
i
at
the
social
entertainment
we
became
exceedingly
chatty
nor
did
i
fail
to
observe
among
that
crowd
of
foreign
dignitaries
and
magnates
from
all
parts
of
america
that
my
worthy
friend
did
not
appear
so
exalted
as
when
leaning
in
solitary
state
against
the
brass
railing
of
the
like
many
other
gentlemen
he
appeared
to
the
best
advantage
and
was
treated
with
the
most
deference
in
the
bosom
of
his
home
the
frigate
our
morning
and
evening
quarters
were
agreeably
diversified
for
some
weeks
by
a
little
circumstance
which
to
some
of
us
at
least
always
seemed
very
pleasing
at
callao
half
of
the
cabin
had
been
hospitably
yielded
to
the
family
of
a
certain
magnate
who
was
going
ambassador
from
peru
to
the
court
of
the
brazils
at
rio
this
dignified
diplomatist
sported
a
long
twirling
mustache
that
almost
enveloped
his
mouth
the
sailors
said
he
looked
like
a
rat
with
his
teeth
through
a
bunch
of
oakum
or
a
jago
monkey
peeping
through
a
bush
he
was
accompanied
by
a
very
beautiful
wife
and
a
still
more
beautiful
little
daughter
about
six
years
old
between
this
little
gipsy
and
our
chaplain
there
soon
sprung
up
a
cordial
love
and
good
feeling
so
much
so
that
they
were
seldom
apart
and
whenever
the
drum
beat
to
quarters
and
the
sailors
were
hurrying
to
their
stations
this
little
signorita
would
outrun
them
all
to
gain
her
own
quarters
at
the
capstan
where
she
would
stand
by
the
side
grasping
his
hand
and
looking
up
archly
in
his
face
it
was
a
sweet
relief
from
the
domineering
sternness
of
our
martial
sternness
not
relaxed
even
at
our
devotions
before
the
altar
of
the
common
god
of
commodore
and
see
that
lovely
little
girl
standing
among
the
pounders
and
now
and
then
casting
a
wondering
commiserating
glance
at
the
array
of
grim
seamen
around
her
chapter
lxx
monthly
muster
round
the
capstan
besides
general
quarters
and
the
regular
morning
and
evening
quarters
for
prayers
on
board
the
neversink
on
the
first
sunday
of
every
month
we
had
a
grand
round
the
when
we
passed
in
solemn
review
before
the
captain
and
officers
who
closely
scanned
our
frocks
and
trowsers
to
see
whether
they
were
according
to
the
navy
cut
in
some
ships
every
man
is
required
to
bring
his
bag
and
hammock
along
for
inspection
this
ceremony
acquires
its
chief
solemnity
and
to
a
novice
is
rendered
even
terrible
by
the
reading
of
the
articles
of
war
by
the
clerk
before
the
assembled
company
who
in
testimony
of
their
enforced
reverence
for
the
code
stand
bareheaded
till
the
last
sentence
is
pronounced
to
a
mere
amateur
reader
the
quiet
perusal
of
these
articles
of
war
would
be
attended
with
some
nervous
emotions
imagine
then
what
feelings
must
have
been
when
with
my
hat
deferentially
in
my
hand
i
stood
before
my
lord
and
master
captain
claret
and
heard
these
articles
read
as
the
law
and
gospel
the
infallible
unappealable
dispensation
and
code
whereby
i
lived
and
moved
and
had
my
being
on
board
of
the
united
states
ship
neversink
of
some
twenty
a
seaman
may
commit
and
which
are
specified
in
this
code
thirteen
are
punishable
by
death
suffer
death
this
was
the
burden
of
nearly
every
article
read
by
the
clerk
for
he
seemed
to
have
been
instructed
to
omit
the
longer
articles
and
only
present
those
which
were
brief
and
to
the
point
suffer
death
the
repeated
announcement
falls
on
your
ear
like
the
intermitting
discharge
of
artillery
after
it
has
been
repeated
again
and
again
you
listen
to
the
reader
as
he
deliberately
begins
a
new
paragraph
you
hear
him
reciting
the
involved
but
comprehensive
and
clear
arrangement
of
the
sentence
detailing
all
possible
particulars
of
the
offence
described
and
you
breathlessly
await
whether
clause
also
is
going
to
be
concluded
by
the
discharge
of
the
terrible
when
lo
it
again
booms
on
your
suffer
death
no
reservations
no
contingencies
not
the
remotest
promise
of
pardon
or
reprieve
not
a
glimpse
of
commutation
of
the
sentence
all
hope
and
consolation
is
shut
suffer
death
that
is
the
simple
fact
for
you
to
digest
and
it
is
a
tougher
morsel
believe
when
he
says
it
than
a
but
there
is
a
glimmering
of
an
alternative
to
the
sailor
who
infringes
these
articles
some
of
them

this

still

is
it
upon

to

the
articles

is

with
its
walls
papered
from

to

with

copies
in

of

it
needs
not
to
dilate
upon
the
pure
bubbling
milk
of
human
kindness
and
christian
charity
and
forgiveness
of
injuries
which
pervade
this
charming
document
so
thoroughly
imbued
as
a
christian
code
with
the
benignant
spirit
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
but
as
it
is
very
nearly
alike
in
the
foremost
states
of
christendom
and
as
it
is
nationally
set
forth
by
those
states
it
indirectly
becomes
an
index
to
the
true
condition
of
the
present
civilization
of
the

like

on

track

point
passing
unnumbered
needles
through
chapter
lxxi
the
genealogy
of
the
articles
of
war
as
the
articles
of
war
form
the
ark
and
constitution
of
the
penal
laws
of
the
american
navy
in
all
sobriety
and
earnestness
it
may
be
well
to
glance
at
their
origin
whence
came
they
and
how
is
it
that
one
arm
of
the
national
defences
of
a
republic
comes
to
be
ruled
by
a
turkish
code
whose
every
section
almost
like
each
of
the
tubes
of
a
revolving
pistol
fires
nothing
short
of
death
into
the
heart
of
an
offender
how
comes
it
that
by
virtue
of
a
law
solemnly
ratified
by
a
congress
of
freemen
the
representatives
of
freemen
thousands
of
americans
are
subjected
to
the
most
despotic
usages
and
from
the
dockyards
of
a
republic
absolute
monarchies
are
launched
with
the
stars
and
for
an
ensign
by
what
unparalleled
anomaly
by
what
monstrous
grafting
of
tyranny
upon
freedom
did
these
articles
of
war
ever
come
to
be
so
much
as
heard
of
in
the
american
navy
whence
came
they
they
can
not
be
the
indigenous
growth
of
those
political
institutions
which
are
based
upon
that
thomas
declaration
of
independence
no
they
are
an
importation
from
abroad
even
from
britain
whose
laws
we
americans
hurled
off
as
tyrannical
and
yet
retained
the
most
tyrannical
of
all
but
we
stop
not
here
for
these
articles
of
war
had
their
congenial
origin
in
a
period
of
the
history
of
britain
when
the
puritan
republic
had
yielded
to
a
monarchy
restored
when
a
hangman
judge
jeffreys
sentenced
a
champion
like
algernon
sidney
to
the
block
when
one
of
a
race
by
some
deemed
accursed
of
a
stuart
was
on
the
throne
and
a
stuart
also
was
at
the
head
of
the
navy
as
lord
high
admiral
one
the
son
of
a
king
beheaded
for
encroachments
upon
the
rights
of
his
people
and
the
other
his
own
brother
afterward
a
king
james
who
was
hurled
from
the
throne
for
his
tyranny
this
is
the
origin
of
the
articles
of
war
and
it
carries
with
it
an
unmistakable
clew
to
their
despotism
the
first
naval
articles
of
war
in
the
english
language
were
passed
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
charles
the
second
under
the
title
of
act
for
establishing
articles
and
orders
for
the
regulating
and
better
government
of
his
navies
and
forces
by
this
act
was
repealed
and
so
far
as
concerned
the
officers
a
modification
of
it
substituted
in
the
year
of
the
reign
of
george
the
second
shortly
after
the
peace
of
aix
la
chapelle
just
one
century
ago
this
last
act
it
is
believed
comprises
in
substance
the
articles
of
war
at
this
day
in
force
in
the
british
navy
it
is
not
a
little
curious
nor
without
meaning
that
neither
of
these
acts
explicitly
empowers
an
officer
to
inflict
the
lash
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
in
this
case
the
british
lawgivers
were
willing
to
leave
such
a
stigma
out
of
an
organic
statute
and
bestow
the
power
of
the
lash
in
some
less
solemn
and
perhaps
less
public
manner
indeed
the
only
broad
enactments
directly
sanctioning
naval
scourging
at
sea
are
to
be
found
in
the
united
states
statute
book
and
in
the
of
the
absolute
monarch
louis
le
grand
of
france
taking
for
their
basis
the
british
naval
code
and
ingrafting
upon
it
the
positive
scourging
laws
which
britain
was
loth
to
recognise
as
organic
statutes
our
american
lawgivers
in
the
year
framed
the
articles
of
war
now
governing
the
american
navy
they
may
be
found
in
the
second
volume
of
the
states
statutes
at
large
under
chapter
act
for
the
government
of
the
navy
of
the
united
for
reference
to
the
latter
de
la
marine
on
the
rights
and
duties
of
according
to
the
general
maritime
part
i
nor
is
it
a
dumb
thing
that
the
men
who
in
democratic
time
first
proved
to
the
nations
the
toughness
of
the
british
oak
and
the
hardihood
of
the
british
in
time
whose
fleets
struck
terror
into
the
cruisers
of
france
spain
portugal
and
holland
and
the
corsairs
of
algiers
and
the
levant
in
time
when
robert
blake
swept
the
narrow
seas
of
all
the
keels
of
a
dutch
admiral
who
insultingly
carried
a
broom
at
his
it
is
not
a
dumb
thing
that
at
a
period
deemed
so
glorious
to
the
british
navy
these
articles
of
war
were
unknown
nevertheless
it
is
granted
that
some
laws
or
other
must
have
governed
sailors
at
that
period
but
they
must
have
been
far
less
severe
than
those
laid
down
in
the
written
code
which
superseded
them
since
according
to
the
of
james
the
historian
of
the
rebellion
the
english
navy
prior
to
the
enforcement
of
the
new
code
was
full
of
officers
and
sailors
who
of
all
men
were
the
most
republican
moreover
the
same
author
informs
us
that
the
first
work
undertaken
by
his
respected
then
duke
of
york
upon
entering
on
the
duties
of
lord
high
admiral
was
to
have
a
grand
of
the
which
still
carried
on
their
sterns
names
too
democratic
to
suit
his
ears
but
if
these
articles
of
war
were
unknown
in
time
and
also
during
the
most
brilliant
period
of
admiral
career
what
inference
must
follow
that
such
tyrannical
ordinances
are
not
during
the
highest
possible
efficiency
of
a
military
marine
chapter
lxxii
are
the
good
ordinances
of
the
sea
which
wise
men
who
voyaged
round
the
world
gave
to
our
ancestors
and
which
constitute
the
books
of
the
science
of
good
consulate
of
the
the
present
usages
of
the
american
navy
are
such
that
though
there
is
no
government
enactment
to
that
effect
yet
in
many
respect
its
commanders
seem
virtually
invested
with
the
power
to
observe
or
violate
as
seems
to
them
fit
several
of
the
articles
of
war
according
to
article
person
in
the
navy
shall
quarrel
with
any
other
person
in
the
navy
nor
use
provoking
or
reproachful
words
gestures
or
menaces
on
pain
of
such
punishment
as
a
shall
or
reproachful
words
officers
of
the
navy
answer
me
have
you
not
many
of
you
a
thousand
times
violated
this
law
and
addressed
to
men
whose
tongues
were
tied
by
this
very
article
language
which
no
landsman
would
ever
hearken
to
without
flying
at
the
throat
of
his
insulter
i
know
that
worse
words
than
ever
used
are
to
be
heard
addressed
by
a
to
his
crew
but
the
does
not
live
under
this
xvth
article
of
war
not
to
make
an
example
of
him
nor
to
gratify
any
personal
feeling
but
to
furnish
one
certain
illustration
of
what
is
here
asserted
i
honestly
declare
that
captain
claret
of
the
neversink
repeatedly
violated
this
law
in
his
own
proper
person
according
to
article
no
officer
or
other
person
in
the
navy
shall
be
guilty
of
fraud
profane
swearing
drunkenness
or
any
other
scandalous
again
let
me
ask
you
officers
of
the
navy
whether
many
of
you
have
not
repeatedly
and
in
more
than
one
particular
violated
this
law
and
here
again
as
a
certain
illustration
i
must
once
more
cite
captain
claret
as
an
offender
especially
in
the
matter
of
profane
swearing
i
must
also
cite
four
of
the
lieutenants
some
eight
of
the
midshipmen
and
nearly
all
the
seamen
additional
articles
might
be
quoted
that
are
habitually
violated
by
the
officers
while
nearly
all
those
referring
to
the
sailors
are
unscrupulously
enforced
yet
those
articles
by
which
the
sailor
is
scourged
at
the
gangway
are
not
one
whit
more
laws
than
those
articles
binding
upon
the
officers
that
have
become
obsolete
from
immemorial
disuse
while
still
other
articles
to
which
the
sailors
alone
are
obnoxious
are
observed
or
violated
at
the
caprice
of
the
captain
now
if
it
be
not
so
much
the
severity
as
the
certainty
of
punishment
that
deters
from
transgression
how
fatal
to
all
proper
reverence
for
the
enactments
of
congress
must
be
this
disregard
of
its
statutes
still
more
this
violation
of
the
law
on
the
part
of
the
officers
in
many
cases
involves
oppression
to
the
sailor
but
throughout
the
whole
naval
code
which
so
hems
in
the
mariner
by
law
upon
law
and
which
invests
the
captain
with
so
much
judicial
and
administrative
authority
over
most
cases
entirely
one
solitary
clause
is
to
be
found
which
in
any
way
provides
means
for
a
seaman
deeming
himself
aggrieved
to
obtain
redress
indeed
both
the
written
and
unwritten
laws
of
the
american
navy
are
as
destitute
of
individual
guarantees
to
the
mass
of
seamen
as
the
statute
book
of
the
despotic
empire
of
russia
who
put
this
great
gulf
between
the
american
captain
and
the
american
sailor
or
is
the
captain
a
creature
of
like
passions
with
ourselves
or
is
he
an
infallible
archangel
incapable
of
the
shadow
of
error
or
has
a
sailor
no
mark
of
humanity
no
attribute
of
manhood
that
bound
hand
and
foot
he
is
cast
into
an
american
frigate
shorn
of
all
rights
and
defences
while
the
notorious
lawlessness
of
the
commander
has
passed
into
a
proverb
familiar
to
law
was
not
made
for
the
captain
indeed
he
may
almost
be
said
to
put
off
the
citizen
when
he
touches

and

indeed
remember
also
that
though
the
sailor
is
sometimes
tried
for
his
life
before
a
tribunal
like
this
in
no
case
do
his
his
peers
form
part
of
the
court
yet
that
a
man
should
be
tried
by
his
peers
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
all
civilised
jurisprudence
and
not
only
tried
by
his
peers
but
his
peers
must
be
unanimous
to
render
a
verdict
whereas
in
a
the
concurrence
of
a
majority
of
conventional
and
social
superiors
is
all
that
is
requisite
in
the
english
navy
it
is
said
they
had
a
law
which
authorised
the
sailor
to
appeal
if
he
chose
from
the
decision
of
the
in
a
comparatively
trivial
the
higher
tribunal
of
a
it
was
an
english
seaman
who
related
this
to
me
when
i
said
that
such
a
law
must
be
a
fatal
clog
to
the
exercise
of
the
penal
power
in
the
captain
he
in
substance
told
me
the
following
story
a
guilty
of
drunkenness
being
sent
to
the
gratings
and
the
scourge
about
to
be
inflicted
he
turned
round
and
demanded
a
the
captain
smiled
and
ordered
him
to
be
taken
down
and
put
into
the
there
he
was
kept
in
irons
some
weeks
when
despairing
of
being
liberated
he
offered
to
compromise
at
two
dozen
lashes
of
your
bargain
then
are
you
said
the
captain
no
a
you
demanded
and
a
you
shall
have
being
at
last
tried
before
the
bar
of
officers
he
was
condemned
to
two
hundred
lashes
what
for
for
his
having
been
drunk
no
for
his
having
had
the
insolence
to
appeal
from
an
authority
in
maintaining
which
the
men
who
tried
and
condemned
him
had
so
strong
a
sympathetic
interest
whether
this
story
be
wholly
true
or
not
or
whether
the
particular
law
involved
prevails
or
ever
did
prevail
in
the
english
navy
the
thing
nevertheless
illustrates
the
ideas
that
themselves
have
touching
the
tribunals
in
question
what
can
be
expected
from
a
court
whose
deeds
are
done
in
the
darkness
of
the
recluse
courts
of
the
spanish
inquisition
when
that
darkness
is
solemnised
by
an
oath
on
the
bible
when
an
oligarchy
of
epaulets
sits
upon
the
bench
and
a
plebeian
without
a
jury
stands
judicially
naked
at
the
bar
in
view
of
these
things
and
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
in
several
cases
the
degree
of
punishment
inflicted
upon
a
is
absolutely
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
what
shame
should
american
legislators
take
to
themselves
that
with
perfect
truth
we
may
apply
to
the
entire
body
of
the
american
that
infallible
principle
of
sir
edward
coke
is
one
of
the
genuine
marks
of
servitude
to
have
the
law
either
concealed
or
but
still
better
may
we
subscribe
to
the
saying
of
sir
matthew
hale
in
his
history
of
the
common
law
that
martial
law
being
based
upon
no
settled
principles
is
in
truth
and
reality
no
law
but
something
indulged
rather
than
allowed
as
a
i
know
it
may
be
said
that
the
whole
nature
of
this
naval
code
is
purposely
adapted
to
the
war
exigencies
of
the
navy
but
waiving
the
grave
question
that
might
be
raised
concerning
the
moral
not
judicial
lawfulness
of
this
arbitrary
code
even
in
time
of
war
be
it
asked
why
it
is
in
force
during
a
time
of
peace
the
united
states
has
now
existed
as
a
nation
upward
of
seventy
years
and
in
all
that
time
the
alleged
necessity
for
the
operation
of
the
naval
cases
deemed
only
existed
during
a
period
of
two
or
three
years
at
most
some
may
urge
that
the
severest
operations
of
the
code
are
tacitly
made
null
in
time
of
peace
but
though
with
respect
to
several
of
the
articles
this
holds
true
yet
at
any
time
any
and
all
of
them
may
be
legally
enforced
nor
have
there
been
wanting
recent
instances
illustrating
the
spirit
of
this
code
even
in
cases
where
the
letter
of
the
code
was
not
altogether
observed
the
case
of
a
united
states
brig
furnishes
a
memorable
example
which
at
any
moment
may
be
repeated
three
men
in
a
time
of
peace
were
then
hung
at
the
merely
because
in
the
judgment
it
became
necessary
to
hang
them
to
this
day
the
question
of
their
complete
guilt
is
socially
discussed
how
shall
we
characterise
such
a
deed
says
blackstone
any
one
that
hath
commission
of
martial
authority
doth
in
time
of
peace
hang
or
otherwise
execute
any
man
by
colour
of

unusualness
of

of

the

vested
in
its

the
fact

officer

service

the

any
other
relation

man
may
stand

is
he
unmindful
that
both
wisdom
and
humanity
dictate
that
from
the
peculiarity
of
his
position
a
in
command
should
be
clothed
with
a
degree
of
authority
and
discretion
inadmissible
in
any
master
ashore
but
at
the
same
time
these
by
all
writers
on
maritime
undoubtedly
furnished
warrant
for
clothing
modern
and
naval
with
powers
which
exceed
the
due
limits
of
reason
and
necessity
nor
is
this
the
only
instance
where
right
and
salutary
principles
in
themselves
almost
and
infallible
have
been
advanced
in
justification
of
things
which
in
themselves
are
just
as
wrong
and
pernicious
be
it
here
once
and
for
all
understood
that
no
sentimental
and
theoretic
love
for
the
common
sailor
no
romantic
belief
in
that
peculiar
and
exaggerated
generosity
of
disposition
fictitiously
imputed
to
him
in
novels
and
no
prevailing
desire
to
gain
the
reputation
of
being
his
friend
have
actuated
me
in
anything
i
have
said
in
any
part
of
this
work
touching
the
gross
oppression
under
which
i
know
that
the

suffers
indifferent
as

who
may
be

parties
concerned

but
desire
to
see
wrong
things
righted
and
equal
justice
administered
to
all
nor
as
has
been
elsewhere
hinted
is
the
general
ignorance
or
depravity
of
any
race
of
men
to
be
alleged
as
an
apology
for
tyranny
over
them
on
the
contrary
it
can
not
admit
of
a
reasonable
doubt
in
any
unbiased
mind
conversant
with
the
interior
life
of
a
that
most
of
the
sailor
iniquities
practised
therein
are
indirectly
to
be
ascribed
to
the
morally
debasing
effects
of
the
unjust
despotic
and
degrading
laws
under
which
the

gambling
in
a
mention
has
been
made
that
the
game
of
draughts
or
checkers
was
permitted
to
be
played
on
board
the
neversink
at
the
present
time
while
there
was
little
or
no
shipwork
to
be
done
and
all
hands
in
high
spirits
were
sailing
homeward
over
the
warm
smooth
sea
of
the
tropics
so
numerous
became
the
players
scattered
about
the
decks
that
our
first
lieutenant
used
ironically
to
say
that
it
was
a
pity
they
were
not
tesselated
with
squares
of
white
and
black
marble
for
the
express
benefit
and
convenience
of
the
players
had
this
gentleman
had
his

pitched
out

but
the
lenient
in
some
them
and
so
bridewell
was
fain
to
hold
his
peace
but
although
this
one
game
was
allowable
in
the
frigate
all
kinds
of
gambling
were
strictly
interdicted
under
the
penalty
of
the
gangway
nor
were
cards
or
dice
tolerated
in
any
way
whatever
this
regulation
was
indispensable
for
of
all
human
beings
are
perhaps
the
most
inclined
to
gambling
the
reason
must
be
obvious
to
any
one
who
reflects
upon
their
condition
on
shipboard
and
most
mischievous
of
vices
a
operates
still
more
perniciously
than
on
shore
but
quite
as
often
as
the
law
against
smuggling
spirits
is
transgressed
by
the
unscrupulous
sailors
the
statutes
against
cards
and
dice
are
evaded
sable
night
which
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
has
winked
and
looked
on
at
so
many
deeds
of
is
the
time
usually
selected
for
their
operations
by
gamblers
the
place
pitched
upon
is
generally
the
where
the
hammocks
are
swung
and
which
is
lighted
so
stintedly
as
not
to
disturb
the
sleeping
seamen
with
any
obtruding
glare
in
so
spacious
an
area
the
two
lanterns
swinging
from
the
stanchions
diffuse
a
subdued
illumination
like
a
in
the
apartment
of
some
invalid
owing
to
their
position
also
these
lanterns
are
far
from
shedding
an
impartial
light
however
dim
but
fling
long
angular
rays
here
and
there
like
in
the
vaults
of
the
west
india
docks
on
the
thames
it
may
well
be
imagined
therefore
how
well
adapted
is
this
mysterious
and
subterranean
hall
of
eblis
to
the
clandestine
proceedings
of
gamblers
especially
as
the
hammocks
not
only
hang
thickly
but
many
of
them
swing
very
low
within
two
feet
of
the
floor
thus
forming
innumerable
little
canvas
glens
grottoes
nooks
corners
and
crannies
where
a
good
deal
of
wickedness
may
be
practiced
by
the
wary
with
considerable
impunity
now
the
assisted
by
his
mates
the
corporals
reigns
supreme
in
these
bowels
of
the
ship
throughout
the
night
these
policemen
relieve
each
other
at
standing
guard
over
the
premises
and
except
when
the
watches
are
called
they
sit
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
silence
only
invaded
by
snores
or
the
ramblings
of
some
old
in
his
sleep
the
two
corporals
went
among
the
sailors
by
the
names
of
leggs
and
pounce
pounce
had
been
a
policeman
it
was
said
in

leggs
a
turnkey
attached
to
in
new

hence
their
education
eminently
fitted
them
for
their
stations
and
bland
the
ravished
with
their
dexterity
in
prying
out
offenders
used
to
call
them
his
two
right
hands
when
desire
to
gamble
they
appoint
the
hour
and
select
some
certain
corner
in
some
certain
shadow
behind
some
certain
hammock
they
then
contribute
a
small
sum
toward
a
joint
fund
to
be
invested
in
a
bribe
for
some
shipmate
who
shall
play
the
part
of
a
spy
upon
the
and
corporals
while
the
gaming
is
in
progress
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
these
arrangements
are
so
cunning
and
comprehensive
that
the
gamblers
eluding
all
vigilance
conclude
their
game
unmolested
but
now
and
then
seduced
into
unwariness
or
perhaps
from
parsimony
being
unwilling
to
employ
the
services
of
a
spy
they
are
suddenly
lighted
upon
by
the
constables
remorselessly
collared
and
dragged
into
the
brig
there
to
await
a
dozen
lashes
in
the
morning
several
times
at
midnight
i
have
been
startled
out
of
a
sound
sleep
by
a
sudden
violent
rush
under
my
hammock
caused
by
the
abrupt
breaking
up
of
some
nest
of
gamblers
who
have
scattered
in
all
directions
brushing
under
the
tiers
of
swinging
pallets
and
setting
them
all
in
a
rocking
commotion
it
is
however
while
laying
in
port
that
gambling
most
thrives
in
a
then
the
men
frequently
practice
their
dark
deeds
in
the
light
of
the
day
and
the
additional
guards
which
at
such
times
they
deem
indispensable
are
not
unworthy
of
note
more
especially
their
extra
precautions
in
engaging
the
services
of
several
spies
necessitate
a
considerable
expenditure
so
that
in
port
the
diversion
of
gambling
rises
to
the
dignity
of
a
nabob
luxury
during
the
day
the
and
his
corporals
are
continually
prowling
about
on
all
three
decks
eager
to
spy
out
iniquities
at
one
time
for
example
you
see
leggs
switching
his
magisterial
rattan
and
lurking
round
the
on
the
the
next
moment
perhaps
he
is
three
decks
down
out
of
sight
prowling
among
the
just
so
with
his
master
and
pounce
his
coadjutor
they
are
here
there
and
everywhere
seemingly
gifted
with
ubiquity
in
order
successfully
to
carry
on
their
proceedings
by
day
the
gamblers
must
see
to
it
that
each
of
these
constables
is
relentlessly
dogged
wherever
he
goes
so
that
in
case
of
his
approach
toward
the
spot
where
themselves
are
engaged
they
may
be
warned
of
the
fact
in
time
to
make
good
their
escape
accordingly
light
and
active
scouts
are
selected
to
follow
the
constable
about
from
their
youthful
alertness
and
activity
the
boys
of
the
are
generally
chosen
for
this
purpose
but
this
is
not
all
onboard
of
most
there
is
a
set
of
sly
knavish
foxes
among
the
crew
destitute
of
every
principle
of
honour
and
on
a
par
with
irish
informers
in
parlance
they
come
under
the
denomination
of
and
they
are
called
because
from
their
zeal
in
craftily
reporting
offenders
they
are
presumed
to
be
regarded
with
high
favour
by
some
of
the
officers
though
it
is
seldom
that
these
informers
can
be
certainly
individualised
so
secret
and
subtle
are
they
in
laying
their
information
yet
certain
of
the
crew
and
especially
certain
of
the
marines
are
invariably
suspected
to
be
and
and
are
accordingly
more
or
less
hated
by
their
comrades
now
in
addition
to
having
an
eye
on
the
and
his
aids
the
must
see
to
it
that
every
person
suspected
of
being
a
or
is
dogged
wherever
he
goes
additional
scouts
are
retained
constantly
to
snuff
at
their
trail
but
the
mysteries
of
vice
are
wonderful
and
it
is
now
to
be
recorded
that
from
long
habit
and
observation
and
familiarity
with
the
and
of
a
frigate
the
and
his
aids
can
almost
invariably
tell
when
any
gambling
is
going
on
by
day
though
in
the
crowded
vessel
abounding
in
decks
tops
dark
places
and
outlandish
corners
of
all
sorts
they
may
not
be

forecastle

not

would
take
the
best
specimen
of
a
seaman
for
a
landsman

you
see
a
fellow
yawning
about
the

pennant
of

from

chapter
lxxiv
the
at
night
the
whole
of
our
run
from
rio
to
the
line
was
one
delightful
yachting
so
far
as
fine
weather
and
the
sailing
were
concerned
it
was
especially
pleasant
when
our
lounged
in
the
diverting
ourselves
in
many
agreeable
ways
removed
from
the
immediate
presence
of
the
officers
we
there
harmlessly
enjoyed
ourselves
more
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
ship
by
day
many
of
us
were
very
industrious
making
hats
or
mending
our
clothes
but
by
night
we
became
more
romantically
inclined
often
jack
chase
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
would
direct
our
attention
to
the
moonlight
on
the
waves
by
fine
snatches
from
his
catalogue
of
poets
i
shall
never
forget
the
lyric
air
with
which
one
morning
at
dawn
of
day
when
all
the
east
was
flushed
with
red
and
gold
he
stood
leaning
against
the
shrouds
and
stretching
his
bold
hand
over
the
sea
exclaimed
comes
aurora
see
and
in
a
liquid
tone
he
recited
the
lines
gentle
hand
as
seeming
oft
to
pause
the
purple
curtains
of
the
morn
she
camoens
bear
a
hand
there
we
must
rig
out
that
wind
is
from
our
lofty
perch
of
a
moonlight
night
the
frigate
itself
was
a
glorious
sight
she
was
going
large
before
the
wind
her
set
on
both
sides
so
that
the
canvas
on
the
and
presented
the
appearance
of
majestic
tapering
pyramids
more
than
a
hundred
feet
broad
at
the
base
and
terminating
in
the
clouds
with
the
light
copestone
of
the
royals
that
immense
area
of
canvas
sliding
along
the
sea
was
indeed
a
magnificent
spectacle
the
three
shrouded
masts
looked
like
the
apparitions
of
three
gigantic
turkish
emirs
striding
over
the
ocean
nor
at
times
was
the
sound
of
music
wanting
to
augment
the
poetry
of
the
scene
the
whole
band
would
be
assembled
on
the
poop
regaling
the
officers
and
incidentally
ourselves
with
their
fine
old
airs
to
these
some
of
us
would
occasionally
dance
in
the
which
was
almost
as
large
as
an
ordinary
sized
parlour
when
the
instrumental
melody
of
the
band
was
not
to
be
had
our
nightingales
mustered
their
voices
and
gave
us
a
song
upon
these
occasions
jack
chase
was
often
called
out
and
regaled
us
in
his
own
free
and
noble
style
with
the
favourite
thing
with
british
many
other
ballads
and
ditties
including
patrick
spens
was
the
best
sailor
that
ever
sailed
the
also
three
times
around
spun
our
gallant
ship
three
times
around
spun
she
three
times
around
spun
our
gallant
ship
and
she
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
the
sea
the
sea
the
sea
and
she
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
these
songs
would
be
varied
by
sundry
and
of
the
and
it
was
at
these
times
that
i
always
endeavoured
to
draw
out
the
oldest
tritons
into
narratives
of
the
they
had
seen
there
were
but
few
of
them
it
is
true
who
had
been
in
action
but
that
only
made
their
narratives
the
more
valuable
there
was
an
old
negro
who
went
by
the
name
of
tawney
a
whom
we
often
invited
into
our
top
of
tranquil
nights
to
hear
him
discourse
he
was
a
staid
and
sober
seaman
very
intelligent
with
a
fine
frank
bearing
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
ship
and
held
in
high
estimation
by
every
one
it
seems
that
during
the
last
war
between
england
and
america
he
had
with
several
others
been
upon
the
high
seas
out
of
a
new
england
merchantman
the
ship
that
impressed
him
was
an
english
frigate
the
macedonian
afterward
taken
by
the
neversink
the
ship
in
which
we
were
sailing
it
was
the
holy
sabbath
according
to
tawney
and
as
the
briton
bore
down
on
the
men
at
their
and
his
countrymen
who
happened
to
be
stationed
at
the
battery
respectfully
accosted
the
old
man
by
the
name
of
he
passed
them
in
his
rapid
promenade
his
under
his
arm
again
they
assured
him
that
they
were
not
englishmen
and
that
it
was
a
most
bitter
thing
to
lift
their
hands
against
the
flag
of
that
country
which
harboured
the
mothers
that
bore
them
they
conjured
him
to
release
them
from
their
guns
and
allow
them
to
remain
neutral
during
the
conflict
but
when
a
ship
of
any
nation
is
running
into
action
it
is
no
time
for
argument
small
time
for
justice
and
not
much
time
for
humanity
snatching
a
pistol
from
the
belt
of
a
boarder
standing
by
the
captain
levelled
it
at
the
heads
of
the
three
sailors
and
commanded
them
instantly
to
their
quarters
under
penalty
of
being
shot
on
the
spot
so
side
by
side
with
his
foes
tawney
and
his
companions
toiled
at
the
guns
and
fought
out
the
fight
to
the
last
with
the
exception
of
one
of
them
who
was
killed
at
his
post
by
one
of
his
own
balls
at
length
having
lost
her
fore
and
and
her
having
been
shot
away
to
the
deck
and
her
lying
in
two
pieces
on
her
shattered
forecastle
and
in
a
hundred
places
having
been
with
round
shot
the
english
frigate
was
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
captain
cardan
ordered
his
signal
to
strike
the
flag
tawney
was
one
of
those
who
at
last
helped
pull
him
on
board
the
neversink
as
he
touched
the
deck
cardan
saluted
decatur
the
hostile
commander
and
offered
his
sword
but
it
was
courteously
declined
perhaps
the
victor
remembered
the
dinner
parties
that
he
and
the
englishman
had
enjoyed
together
in
norfolk
just
previous
to
the
breaking
out
of
while
both
were
in
command
of
the
very
frigates
now
crippled
on
the
sea
the
macedonian
it
seems
had
gone
into
norfolk
with
dispatches
they
had
laughed
and
joked
over
their
wine
and
a
wager
of
a
beaver
hat
was
said
to
have
been
made
between
them
upon
the
event
of
the
hostile
meeting
of
their
ships
gazing
upon
the
heavy
batteries
before
him
cardan
said
to
decatur
is
a
not
a
frigate
no
wonder
the
day
is
yours
this
remark
was
founded
upon
the
superiority
in
guns
the
then
consisted
as
now
of
the
of
only
eighteens
in
all
the
neversink
numbered
guns
and
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
the
macedonian
guns
and
three
hundred
men
a
very
great
disparity
which
united
to
the
other
circumstances
of
this
action
deprives
the
victory
of
all
claims
to
glory
beyond
those
that
might
be
set
up
by
a
getting
the
better
of
a
seal
but
if
tawney
spoke
he
was
a
man
this
fact
seemed
counterbalanced
by
a
circumstance
he
related
when
the
guns
of
the
englishman
were
examined
after
the
engagement
in
more
than
one
instance
the
wad
was
found
rammed
against
the
cartridge
without
intercepting
the
ball
and
though
in
a
frantic
such
a
thing
might
be
imputed
to
hurry
and
remissness
yet
tawney
a
stickler
for
his
tribe
always
ascribed
it
to
quite
a
different
and
less
honourable
cause
but
even
granting
the
cause
he
assigned
to
have
been
the
true
one
it
does
not
involve
anything
inimical
to
the
general
valour
displayed
by
the
british
crew
yet
from
all
that
may
be
learned
from
candid
persons
who
have
been
in
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
that
on
board
of
all
ships
of
whatever
nation
in
time
of
action
no
very
small
number
of
the
men
are
exceedingly
nervous
to
say
the
least
at
the
guns
ramming
and
sponging
at
a
venture
and
what
special
patriotic
interest
could
an
impressed
man
for
instance
take
in
a
fight
into
which
he
had
been
dragged
from
the
arms
of
his
wife
or
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
impressed
english
seamen
have
not
scrupled
in
time
of
war
to
cripple
the
arm
that
has
enslaved
them
during
the
same
general
war
which
prevailed
at
and
previous
to
the
period
of
the
here
spoken
of
a
british
in
writing
to
the
admiralty
said
appears
to
be
quiet
in
the
fleet
but
in
preparing
for
battle
last
week
several
of
the
guns
in
the
after
part
of
the
ship
were
found
to
be
spiked
that
is
to
say
rendered
useless
who
had
spiked
them
the
dissatisfied
seamen
is
it
altogether
improbable
then
that
the
guns
to
which
tawney
referred
were
manned
by
men
who
purposely
refrained
from
making
them
tell
on
the
foe
that
in
this
one
action
the
victory
america
gained
was
partly
won
for
her
by
the
sulky
insubordination
of
the
enemy
himself
during
this
same
period
of
general
war
it
was
frequently
the
case
that
the
guns
of
english
armed
ships
were
found
in
the
mornings
with
their
breechings
cut
over
night
this
maiming
of
the
guns
and
for
the
time
incapacitating
them
was
only
to
be
imputed
to
that
secret
spirit
of
hatred
to
the
service
which
induced
the
spiking
above
referred
to
but
even
in
cases
where
no
dissatisfaction
was
presumed
to
prevail
among
the
crew
and
where
a
seaman
in
time
of
action
impelled
by
pure
fear
from
his
gun
it
seems
but
flying
in
the
face
of
him
who
made
such
a
seaman
what
he
constitutionally
was
to
sew
upon
his
back
and
degrade
and
agonise
the
already
trembling
wretch
in
numberless
other
ways
nor
seems
it
a
practice
warranted
by
the
sermon
on
the
mount
for
the
officer
of
a
battery
in
time
of
battle
to
stand
over
the
men
with
his
drawn
sword
as
was
done
in
the
macedonian
and
run
through
on
the
spot
the
first
seaman
who
showed
a
semblance
of
fear
tawney
told
me
that
he
distinctly
heard
this
order
given
by
the
english
captain
to
his
officers
of
divisions
were
the
secret
history
of
all
written
the
laurels
of
would
turn
to
ashes
on
their
brows
and
how
nationally
disgraceful
in
every
conceivable
point
of
view
is
the
iv
of
our
american
articles
of
war
any
person
in
the
navy
shall
pusillanimously
cry
for
quarter
he
shall
suffer
thus
with
death
before
his
face
from
the
foe
and
death
behind
his
back
from
his
countrymen
the
best
valour
of
a
can
never
assume
the
merit
of
a
noble
spontaneousness
in
this
as
in
every
other
case
the
articles
of
war
hold
out
no
reward
for
good
conduct
but
only
compel
the
sailor
to
fight
like
a
hired
murderer
for
his
pay
by
digging
his
grave
before
his
eyes
if
he
hesitates
but
this
article
iv
is
open
to
still
graver
objections
courage
is
the
most
common
and
vulgar
of
the
virtues
the
only
one
shared
with
us
by
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
one
most
apt
by
excess
to
run
into
viciousness
and
since
nature
generally
takes
away
with
one
hand
to
her
gifts
with
the
other
excessive
animal
courage
in
many
cases
only
finds
room
in
a
character
vacated
of
loftier
things
but
in
a
naval
officer
animal
courage
is
exalted
to
the
loftiest
merit
and
often
procures
him
a
distinguished
command
hence
if
some
brainless
bravo
be
captain
of
a
frigate
in
action
he
may
fight
her
against
invincible
odds
and
seek
to
crown
himself
with
the
glory
of
the
shambles
by
permitting
his
hopeless
crew
to
be
butchered
before
his
eyes
while
at
the
same
time
that
crew
must
consent
to
be
slaughtered
by
the
foe
under
penalty
of
being
murdered
by
the
law
look
at
the
engagement
between
the
american
frigate
essex
with
the
two
english
cruisers
the
phoebe
and
cherub
off
the
bay
of
valparaiso
during
the
late
war
it
is
admitted
on
all
hands
that
the
american
captain
continued
to
fight
his
crippled
ship
against
a
greatly
superior
force
and
when
at
last
it
became
physically
impossible
that
he
could
ever
be
otherwise
than
vanquished
in
the
end
and
when
from
peculiarly
unfortunate
circumstances
his
men
merely
stood
up
to
their
nearly
useless
batteries
to
be
dismembered
and
blown
to
pieces
by
the
incessant
fire
of
the
long
guns
nor
by
thus
continuing
to
fight
did
this
american
frigate
one
iota
promote
the
true
interests
of
her
country
i
seek
not
to
underrate
any
reputation
which
the
american
captain
may
have
gained
by
this
battle
he
was
a
brave
man
no
sailor
will
deny
but
the
whole
world
is
made
up
of
brave
men
yet
i
would
not
be
at
all
understood
as
impugning
his
special
good
name
nevertheless
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
if
there
were
any
sailors
at
the
guns
of
the
essex
however
valiant
they
may
have
been
those
sailors
must
have
greatly
preferred
to
strike
their
flag
when
they
saw
the
day
was
fairly
lost
than
postpone
that
inevitable
act
till
there
were
few
american
arms
left
to
assist
in
hauling
it
down
yet
had
these
men
under
these
circumstances
cried
for
quarter
by
the
iv
article
of
war
they
might
have
been
legally
hung
according
to
the
negro
tawney
when
the
captain
of
the
that
the
neversink
had
his
vessel
completely
in
her
the
word
to
strike
the
flag
one
of
his
officers
a
man
hated
by
the
seamen
for
his
tyranny
howled
out
the
most
terrific
remonstrances
swearing
that
for
his
part
he
would
not
give
up
but
was
for
sinking
the
macedonian
alongside
the
enemy
had
he
been
captain
doubtless
he
would
have
done
so
thereby
gaining
the
name
of
a
hero
in
this
world
what
would
they
have
called
him
in
the
next
but
as
the
whole
matter
of
war
is
a
thing
that
smites
and
christianity
in
the
face
so
everything
connected
with
it
is
utterly
foolish
unchristian
barbarous
brutal
and
savouring
of
the
feejee
islands
cannibalism
saltpetre
and
the
devil
it
is
generally
the
case
in
a
when
she
strikes
her
flag
that
all
discipline
is
at
an
end
and
the
men
for
a
time
are
ungovernable
this
was
so
on
board
of
the
english
frigate
the
was
broken
open
and
buckets
of
grog
were
passed
along
the
decks
where
many
of
the
wounded
were
lying
between
the
guns
these
mariners
seized
the
buckets
and
spite
of
all
remonstrances
gulped
down
the
burning
spirits
till
as
tawney
said
the
blood
suddenly
spirted
out
of
their
wounds
and
they
fell
dead
to
the
deck
the
negro
had
many
more
stories
to
tell
of
this
fight
and
frequently
he
would
escort
me
along
our
mounting
the
same
guns
used
in
the
out
their
ineffaceable
indentations
and
scars
coated
over
with
the
accumulated
paint
of
more
than
thirty
years
they
were
almost
invisible
to
a
casual
eye
but
tawney
knew
them
all
by
heart
for
he
had
returned
home
in
the
neversink
and
had
beheld
these
scars
shortly
after
the
engagement
one
afternoon
i
was
walking
with
him
along
the
when
he
paused
abreast
of
the
part
of
the
ship

his

were

ordered

soon
as
they
fell
no

as

that
the
sight
of

many
corpses
lying
around
might
not
appall
the

related
the

entering

of

two
thirds
of

the

of

his
which
he

over

to
see
who
they
were
when
perceiving
an
old
messmate
who
had
sailed
with
him
in
many
cruises
he
burst
into
tears
and
taking
the
corpse
up
in
his
arms
and
going
with
it
to
the
side
held
it
over
the

a
moment

it
cried

over

thing
overboard
with
it
and
down
to
your

roared
a

lieutenant
the
order
was
obeyed
and
the
sailor
returned
to
his
post
recitals
were
enough
to
snap
this
sword
in
its
scabbard
and
thinking
of
all
the
cruel
carnal
glory
wrought
out
by
naval
heroes
in
scenes
like
these
i
asked
myself
whether
indeed
that
was
a
glorious
coffin
in
which
lord
nelson
was
coffin
presented
to
him
during
life
by
captain
hallowell
it
had
been
dug
out
of

up
with

fire
destroyed
hundreds
of
frenchmen
at
the
battle
of
the
nile
peace
to
lord
nelson
where
he
sleeps
in
his
mouldering
mast
but
rather
would
i
be
urned
in
the
trunk
of
some
green
tree
and
even
in
death
have
the
vital
sap
circulating
round
me

none
could
match
those
of
jack

our
captain
never
was
there
better
company
than
jack
the
things
which
most
men
only
read
of
or
dream
about
he
had
seen
and
experienced
he
had
been
a
dashing
smuggler
in
his
day
and
could
tell
of
a
long
rammed
home
with
wads
of

silks
of
cartridges
stuffed
with
the
finest
gunpowder

so
sweetly
upon

as

called
them
gallant

bade
them

could
tell
of
desperate
fights
with
his
british
cutters
in
midnight
coves
upon
a
stormy
coast
of
the
capture
of
a
reckless
band
and
their
being

of

that

this
a

for
his

more
than

tell
of

mine
the
style
of

even
then
i
would
scarce
venture
to
give
noble
own
version
of
this
fight
wherein
on
the
of
october
sail
of
englishmen
frenchmen
and
russians
attacked
and
vanquished
in
the
levant
an
ottoman
fleet
of

and

swarm
of
fire

and
hornet
craft
bayed
to
be
at
them
said
jack
when
we
open
fire
we
were
like
dolphin
among
the
man
take
his
was
the
cry
when
we
trained
our
guns
and
those
guns
all
smoked
like
rows
of
dutch
my
hearties
my
crew
carried
small
flags
in
their
bosoms
to
nail
to
the
mast
in
case
the
colours
were
shot
away
stripped
to
the
waistbands
we
fought
like
skinned
tigers
and
bowled
down
the
turkish
frigates
like
among
their
thick
with
men
like
flights
of
pigeons
lighted
on

their
leaden
pease
and
like
a
shower
of
in

it
was
a
stormy
time
my
hearties
the
blasted
turks
pitched
into
the
old
hull
a
whole
quarry
of
marble
shot
each
ball
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
they
knocked
three
into

but
we
gave
them
better
than
they
sent

patting
my

on
the
breech
open
hatchways
in
their
moslem
sides
my
lad
you
ought
to
have
been
there
the
bay
was
covered
with
masts
and
yards
as
i
have
seen
a
raft
of
snags
in
the
arkansas
river
showers
of
burned
rice
and
olives
from
the
exploding
foe
fell
upon
us
like
manna
in

wilderness
allah
mohammed
mohammed
split
the

some
cried
it
out
from
the
turkish
others
shrieked
it
forth
from
the
drowning
waters
their
floating
on
their
shaven
skulls
like
black
snakes
on
rocks
by
those
they
believed
that
their
prophet
would
drag
them
up
to

but
they
sank
fifty
fathoms
my
hearties
to
the
bottom
of
the
bay
the
bloody
going
to
strike
yet
cried
my
first
loader
a
guernsey
man
thrusting
his
neck
out
of
the
and
looking
at
the
turkish
near
by
that
instant
his
head
blew
by
me
like
a
bursting
paixhan
shot
and
the
flag
of
neb
knowles
himself
was
hauled
down
for
ever
we
dragged
his
hull
to
one
side
and
avenged
him
with
the
anvil
which
endways
we
rammed
home
a
shoved
in
the
dead
bloody
scotch
cap
for
the
wad
and
sent
it
flying
into
the
ship
by
the
god
of
war
boys
we
hardly
left
enough
of
that
craft
to
boil
a
pot
of
water
with
it
was
a
hard
sad
work
my
hearties
that
night
when
all
was
over
i
slept
sound
enough
with
a
box
of
cannister
shot
for
my
pillow
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
of
turkish
flags
one
of
our
captains
carried
home
he
swore
to
dress
his
orchard
in
colours
with
them
just
as
our
spars
are
dressed
for
a
gala
you
tormented
the
turks
at
navarino
noble
jack
yet
you
came
off
yourself
with
only
the
loss
of
a
splinter
it
seems
said
a
glancing
at
our
maimed
hand
but
i
and
one
of
the
lieutenants
had
a
narrower
escape
than
that
a
shot
struck
the
side
of
my
and
sent
the
splinters
right
and
left
one
took
off
my
hat
rim
clean
to
my
brow
another
the
left
boot
by
slicing
off
the
heel
a
third
shot
killed
my
without
touching
jack
the
poor
babe
dead
he
was
seated
on
a
of
at
the
time
and
after
the
dust
of
the
powdered
bulwarks
had
blown
away
i
noticed
he
yet
sat
still
his
eyes
wide
open
little
hero
cried
i
and
i
clapped
him
on
the
back
but
he
fell
on
his
face
at
my
feet
i
touched
his
heart
and
found
he
was
dead
there
was
not
a
little
finger
mark
on
silence
now
fell
upon
the
listeners
for
a
time
broken
at
last
by
the
second
captain
of
the
top
jack
i
know
you
never
brag
but
tell
us
what
you
did
yourself
that
day
my
hearties
i
did
not
do
quite
as
much
as
my
gun
but
i
flatter
myself
it
was
that
gun
that
brought
clown
the
turkish
and
the
stump
left
long
enough
to
make
a
wooden
leg
for
lord
but
i
thought
by
the
way
you
pull
a
on
board
here
and
look
along
the
sight
that
you
can
steer
a
shot
about
jack
was
the
admiral
of
the
directed
the
shot
that
dismasted
the
turkish
admiral
said
jack
only
pointed
the
how
did
you
feel
jack
when
the
carried
away
one
of
your
hooks
there
only
a
finger
the
lighter
i
have
seven
more
left
besides
thumbs
and
they
did
good
service
too
in
the
torn
rigging
the
day
after
the
fight
for
you
must
know
my
hearties
that
the
hardest
work
comes
after
the
guns
are
run
in
three
days
i
helped
work
with
one
hand
in
the
rigging
in
the
same
trowsers
that
i
wore
in
the
action
the
blood
had
dried
and
stiffened
they
looked
like
glazed
red
now
this
jack
chase
had
a
heart
in
him
like
a
i
have
seen
him
weep
when
a
man
has
been
flogged
at
the
gangway
yet
in
relating
the
story
of
the
battle
of
navarino
he
plainly
showed
that
he
held
the
god
of
the
blessed
bible
to
have
been
the
british
commodore
in
the
levant
on
the
bloody
of
october
and
thus
it
would
seem
that
war
almost
makes
blasphemers
of
the
best
of
men
and
brings
them
all
down
to
the
feejee
standard
of
humanity
some
have
confessed
to
me
that
as
a
battle
has
raged
more
and
more
their
hearts
have
hardened
in
infernal
harmony
and
like
their
own
guns
they
have
fought
without
a
thought
soldier
or
sailor
the
fighting
man
is
but
a
fiend
and
the
staff
and
of
the
devil
musters
many
a
baton
but
war
at
times
is
inevitable
must
the
national
honour
be
trampled
under
foot
by
an
insolent
foe
say
on
say
on
but
know
you
this
and
lay
it
to
heart
bench
of
bishops
that
he
on
whom
we
believe
has
enjoined
us
to
turn
the
left
cheek
if
the
right
be
smitten
never
mind
what
follows
that
passage
you
can
not
expunge
from
the
bible
that
passage
is
as
binding
upon
us
as
any
other
that
passage
embodies
the
soul
and
substance
of
the
christian
faith
without
it
christianity
were
like
any
other
faith
and
that
passage
will
yet
by
the
blessing
of
god
turn
the
world
but
in
some
things
we
must
turn
quakers
first
but
though
unlike
most
scenes
of
carnage
which
have
proved
useless
murders
of
men
admiral
victory
undoubtedly
achieved
the
emancipation
of
greece
and
terminated
the
turkish
atrocities
in
that
tomahawked
state
yet
who
shall
lift
his
hand
and
swear
that
a
divine
providence
led
the
van
of
the
combined
fleets
of
england
france
and
russia
at
the
battle
of
navarino
for
if
this
be
so
then
it
led
the
van
against
the
own
persecuted
waldenses
in
kindled
the
smithfield
fires
in
bloody
time
but
all
events
are
mixed
in
a
fusion
indistinguishable
what
we
call
fate
is
even
heartless
and
impartial
not
a
fiend
to
kindle
bigot
flames
nor
a
philanthropist
to
espouse
the
cause
of
greece
we
may
fret
fume
and
fight
but
the
thing
called
fate
everlastingly
sustains
an
armed
neutrality
yet
though
all
this
be
so
nevertheless
in
our
own
hearts
we
mould
the
whole
hereafters
and
in
our
own
hearts
we
fashion
our
own
gods
each
mortal
casts
his
vote
for
whom
he
will
to
rule
the
worlds
i
have
a
voice
that
helps
to
shape
eternity
and
my

the
furthest

us
now
do

ourselves

set
off
the

break
down

linger

retreat

and
lanyards
forming

pedestals

shrouds

the
chains
into
numerous
little
chapels
alcoves
niches
and
altars
where
you
lazily
of
the
ship
though
on
board
but
there
are
plenty
to
divide
a
good
thing
with
you
in
this
world
often
when
snugly
seated
in
one
of
these
little
alcoves
gazing
off
to
the
horizon
and
thinking
of
cathay
i
have
been
startled
from
my
repose
by
some
old
who
having
newly
painted
a
parcel
of
wanted
to
set
them
to
dry
at
other
times
one
of
the
tattooing
artists
would
crawl
over
the
bulwarks
followed
by
his
sitter
and
then
a
bare
arm
or
leg
would
be
extended
and
the
disagreeable
business
of
commence
right
under
my
eyes
or
an
irruption
of
tars
with
or
and
piles
of
old
trowsers
to
mend
would
break
in
upon
my
seclusion
and
forming
a
drive
me
off
with
their
chatter
but
was
a
sunday
was
pleasantly
reclining
in
a
particularly
shady
and
secluded
little
niche
between
two
lanyards
when
i
heard
a
low
supplicating
voice
peeping
through
the
narrow
space
between
the
ropes
i
perceived
an
aged
seaman
on
his
knees
his
face
turned
seaward
with
closed
eyes
buried
in
prayer
softly
rising
i
stole
through
a
and
left
the
venerable
worshipper
alone
he
was
a
an
earnest
baptist
and
was
well
known
in
his
own
part
of
the
ship
to
be
constant
in
his
solitary
devotions
in
the
he
reminded
me
of
anthony
going
out
into
the
wilderness
to
pray
this
man
was
captain
of
the
starboard
one
of
the
two
long
on
the
forecastle
in
time
of
action
the
command
of
that
iron
thalaba
the
destroyer
would
devolve
upon
it
would
be
his
business
to
it
properly
to
see
it
well
loaded
the
grape
and
cannister
rammed
home
also
to
the
cartridge
the
sight
and
give
the
word
for
the
to
apply
his
wand
bidding
a
sudden
hell
to
flash
forth
from
the
muzzle
in
wide
combustion
and
death
now
this
captain
of
the
was
an
upright
old
man
a
sincere
humble
believer
and
he
but
earned
his
bread
in
being
captain
of
that
gun
but
how
with
those
hands
of
his
begrimed
with
powder
could
he
break
that
and
most
peaceful
and
penitent
bread
of
the
supper
though
in
that
hallowed
sacrament
it
seemed
he
had
often
partaken
ashore
the
omission
of
this
rite
in
a
there
is
a
chaplain
to
preside
over
it
and
at
least
a
few
communicants
to
be
ascribed
to
a
sense
of
religious
propriety
in
the
last
degree
to
be
commended
ah
the
best
righteousness
of
our
world
seems
but
an
unrealised
ideal
after
all
and
those
maxims
which
in
the
hope
of
bringing
about
a
millennium
we
busily
teach
to
the
heathen
we
christians
ourselves
disregard
in
view
of
the
whole
present
social
of
our
world
so
ill
adapted
to
the
practical
adoption
of
the
meekness
of
christianity
there
seems
almost
some
ground
for
the
thought
that
although
our
blessed
saviour
was
full
of
the
wisdom
of
heaven
yet
his
gospel
seems
lacking
in
the
practical
wisdom
of
a
due
appreciation
of
the
necessities
of
nations
at
times
demanding
bloody
massacres
and
wars
in
a
proper
estimation
of
the
value
of
rank
title
and
money
but
all
this
only
the
more
crowns
the
divine
consistency
of
jesus
since
burnet
and
the
best
theologians
demonstrate
that
his
nature
was
not
merely
not
that

a
mere
man

chapter

the
hospital
in
a
after
running
with
a
fine
steady
breeze
up
to
the
line
it
fell
calm
and
there
we
lay
three
days
enchanted
on
the
sea
we
were
a
most
puissant
no
doubt
with
our
five
hundred
men
commodore
and
captain
backed
by
our
long
batteries
of
and
pounders
yet
for
all
that
there
we
lay
rocking
helpless
as
an
infant
in
the
cradle
had
it
only
been
a
gale
instead
of
a
calm
gladly
would
we
have
charged
upon
it
with
our
gallant
bowsprit
as
with
a
stout
lance
in
rest
but
as
with
this
serene
passive
and
it
out
unconquered
to
the
last
all
these
three
days
the
heat
was
excessive
the
sun
drew
the
tar
from
the
seams
of
the
ship
the
awnings
were
spread
fore
and
aft
the
decks
were
kept
constantly
sprinkled
with
water
it
was
during
this
period
that
a
sad
event
occurred
though
not
an
unusual
one
on
shipboard
but
in
order
to
prepare
for
its
narration
some
account
of
a
part
of
the
ship
called
the
must
needs
be
presented
the
is
that
part
of
a
where
the
invalid
seamen
are
placed
in
many
respects
it
answers
to
a
public
hospital
ashore
as
with
most
frigates
the
of
the
neversink
was
on
the
third
deck
from
above
it
was
in
the
extreme
forward
part
of
that
deck
embracing
the
triangular
area
in
the
bows
of
the
ship
it
was
therefore
a
subterranean
vault
into
which
scarce
a
ray
of
glad
light
ever
penetrated
even
at
noon
in
a
frigate
that
has
all
her
armament
and
stores
on
board
the
floor
of
the
is
partly
below
the
surface
of
the
water
but
in
a
smooth
harbour
some
circulation
of
air
is
maintained
by
opening
large
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
sides
called
not
much
above
the
water
level
before
going
to
sea
however
these
must
be
closed
caulked
and
the
seams
hermetically
sealed
with
pitch
these
places
for
ventilation
being
shut
the
is
entirely
barred
against
the
free
natural
admission
of
fresh
air
in
the
neversink
a
few
lungsful
were
forced
down
by
artificial
means
but
as
the
ordinary
was
the
only
method
adopted
the
quantity
of
fresh
air
sent
down
was
regulated
by
the
force
of
the
wind
in
a
calm
there
was
none
to
be
had
while
in
a
severe
gale
the
had
to
be
hauled
up
on
account
of
the
violent
draught
flowing
full
upon
the
cots
of
the
sick
an
partition
divided
our
from
the
rest
of
the
deck
where
the
hammocks
of
the
watch
were
slung
it
therefore
was
exposed
to
all
the
uproar
that
ensued
upon
the
watches
being
relieved
an
official
called
the
steward
assisted
by
subordinates
presided
over
the
place
he
was
the
same
individual
alluded
to
as
officiating
at
the
amputation
of
the
he
was
always
to
be
found
at
his
post
by
night
and
by
day
this
steward
deserves
a
description
he
was
a
small
pale
young
man
with
that
peculiar
expression
so
often
noticed
in
hospital
attendants
seldom
or
never
did
you
see
him
on
deck
and
when
he
emerge
into
the
light
of
the
sun
it
was
with
an
abashed
look
and
an
uneasy
winking
eye
the
sun
was
not
made
for
his
nervous
organization
was
confounded
by
the
sight
of
the
robust
old
on
the
forecastle
and
the
general
tumult
of
the
and
he
mostly
buried
himself
below
in
an
atmosphere
which
long
habit
had
made
congenial
this
young
man
never
indulged
in
frivolous
conversation
he
only
talked
of
the
prescriptions
his
every
word
was
a
bolus
he
never
was
known
to
smile
nor
did
he
even
look
sober
in
the
ordinary
way
but
his
countenance
ever
wore
an
aspect
of
cadaverous
resignation
to
his
fate
strange
that
so
many
of
those
who
would
fain
minister
to
our
own
health
should
look
so
much
like
invalids
themselves
connected
with
the
over
which
the
steward
removed
from
it
in
place
being
next
door
to
the
of
the
a
regular
shop
of
which
he
kept
the
key
it
was
fitted
up
precisely
like
an
on
shore
displaying
tiers
of
shelves
on
all
four
sides
filled
with
green
bottles
and
gallipots
beneath
were
multitudinous
drawers
bearing
incomprehensible
gilded
inscriptions
in
abbreviated
latin
he
generally
opened
his
shop
for
an
hour
or
two
every
morning
and
evening
there
was
a
venetian
blind
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
which
he
threw
up
when
inside
so
as
to
admit
a
little
air
and
there
you
would
see
him
with
a
green
shade
over
his
eyes
seated
on
a
stool
and
pounding
his
pestle
in
a
great
iron
mortar
that
looked
like
a
howitzer
mixing
some
jallapy
compound
a
smoky
lamp
shed
a
flickering
tinge
upon
his
pallid
face
and
the
regiments
of
gallipots
several
times
when
i
felt
in
need
of
a
little
medicine
but
was
not
ill
enough
to
report
myself
to
the
surgeon
at
his
levees
i
would
call
of
a
morning
upon
his
steward
at
the
sign
of
the
mortar
and
beg
him
to
give
me
what
i
wanted
when
without
speaking
a
word
this
cadaverous
young
man
would
mix
me
my
potion
in
a
tin
cup
and
hand
it
out
through
the
little
opening
in
his
door
like
the
treasurer
giving
you
your
change
at
the
of
a
theatre
but
there
was
a
little
shelf
against
the
wall
of
the
door
and
upon
this
i
would
set
the
tin
cup
for
a
while
and
survey
it
for
i
never
was
a
julius
caesar
at
taking
medicine
and
to
take
it
in
this
way
without
a
single
attempt
at
disguising
it
with
no
counteracting
little
morsel
to
hurry
down
after
it
in
short
to
go
to
the
very
in
person
and
there
at
the
counter
swallow
down
your
dose
as
if
it
were
a
nice
taken
at
the
bar
of
a
was
a
bitter
bolus
indeed
but
then
this
pallid
young
apothecary
charged
nothing
for
it
and
was
no
small
satisfaction
for
is
it
not
remarkable
to
say
the
least
that
a
shore
apothecary
should
actually
charge
you
dollars
and
giving
you
a
horrible
nausea
my
tin
cup
would
wait
a
long
time
on
that
little
shelf
yet
as
the
sailors
called
him
never
heeded
my
lingering
but
in
sober
silent
sadness
continued
pounding
his
mortar
or
folding
up
his
powders
until
at
last
some
other
customer
would
appear
and
then
in
a
sudden
frenzy
of
resolution
i
would
gulp
down
my
and
carry
its
unspeakable
flavour
with
me
far
up
into
the
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
the
wide
roll
of
the
ship
as
felt
in
that
giddy
perch
that
occasioned
it
but
i
always
got
after
taking
medicine
and
going
aloft
with
it
seldom
or
never
did
it
do
me
any
lasting
good
now
the
steward
was
only
a
subordinate
of
surgeon
cuticle
himself
who
lived
in
the
among
the
lieutenants
chaplain
and
purser
the
surgeon
is
by
law
charged
with
the
business
of
overlooking
the
general
sanitary
affairs
of
the
ship
if
anything
is
going
on
in
any
of
its
departments
which
he
judges
to
be
detrimental
to
the
healthfulness
of
the
crew
he
has
a
right
to
protest
against
it
formally
to
the
captain
when
a
man
is
being
scourged
at
the
gangway
the
surgeon
stands
by
and
if
he
thinks
that
the
punishment
is
becoming
more
than
the
constitution
can
well
bear
he
has
a
right
to
interfere
and
demand
its
cessation
for
the
time
but
though
the
navy
regulations
nominally
vest
him
with
this
high
discretionary
authority
over
the
very
commodore
himself
how
seldom
does
he
exercise
it
in
cases
where
humanity
demands
it
three
years
is
a
long
time
to
spend
in
one
ship
and
to
be
at
points
with
its
captain
and
lieutenants
during
such
a
period
must
be
very
unsocial
and
every
way
irksome
no
otherwise
than
thus
at
least
can
the
remissness
of
some
surgeons
in
remonstrating
against
cruelty
be
accounted
for
not
to
speak
again
of
the
continual
dampness
of
the
decks
consequent
upon
flooding
them
with
salt
water
when
we
were
driving
near
to
cape
horn
it
needs
only
to
be
mentioned
that
on
board
of
the
neversink
men
known
to
be
in
consumptions
gasped
under
the
scourge
of
the
mate
when
the
surgeon
and
his
two
attendants
stood
by
and
never
interposed
but
where
the
unscrupulousness
of
martial
discipline
is
maintained
it
is
in
vain
to
attempt
softening
its
rigour
by
the
ordaining
of
humanitarian
laws
sooner
might
you
tame
the
grizzly
bear
of
missouri
than
humanise
a
thing
so
essentially
cruel
and
heartless
but
the
surgeon
has
yet
other
duties
to
perform
not
a
seaman
enters
the
navy
without
undergoing
a
corporal
examination
to
test
his
soundness
in
wind
and
limb
one
of
the
first
places
into
which
i
was
introduced
when
i
first
entered
on
board
the
neversink
was
the
where
i
found
one
of
the
assistant
surgeons
seated
at
a
table
it
was
his
turn
for
visiting
the
apartment
having
been
commanded
by
the
deck
officer
to
report
my
business
to
the
functionary
before
me
i
accordingly
hemmed
to
attract
his
attention
and
then
catching
his
eye
politely
intimated
that
i
called
upon
him
for
the
purpose
of
being
accurately
laid
out
and
surveyed
was
the
answer
and
rolling
up
his
cuff
he
proceeded
to
manipulate
me
he
punched
me
in
the
ribs
smote
me
across
the
chest
commanded
me
to
stand
on
one
leg
and
hold
out
the
other
horizontally
he
asked
me
whether
any
of
my
family
were
consumptive
whether
i
ever
felt
a
tendency
to
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
whether
i
was
gouty
how
often
i
had
been
bled
during
my
life
how
long
i
had
been
ashore
how
long
i
had
been
afloat
with
several
other
questions
which
have
altogether
slipped
my
memory
he
concluded
his
interrogatories
with
this
extraordinary
and
unwarranted
you
pious
it
was
a
leading
question
which
somewhat
staggered
me
but
i
said
not
a
word
when
feeling
of
my
calves
he
looked
up
and
incomprehensibly
said
am
afraid
you
are
at
length
he
declared
me
a
sound
animal
and
wrote
a
certificate
to
that
effect
with
which
i
returned
to
the
deck
this
assistant
surgeon
turned
out
to
be
a
very
singular
character
and
when
i
became
more
acquainted
with
him
i
ceased
to
marvel
at
the
curious
question
with
which
he
had
concluded
his
examination
of
my
person
he
was
a
thin
man
with
a
sour
saturnine
expression
rendered
the
more
peculiar
from
his
shaving
his
beard
so
remorselessly
that
his
chin
and
cheeks
always
looked
blue
as
if
pinched
with
cold
his
long
familiarity
with
nautical
invalids
seemed
to
have
filled
him
full
of
theological
hypoes
concerning
the
state
of
their
souls
he
was
at
once
the
physician
and
priest
of
the
sick
washing
down
his
boluses
with
ghostly
consolation
and
among
the
sailors
went
by
the
name
of
the
pelican
a
fowl
whose
hanging
pouch
imparts
to
it
a
most
lugubrious
expression
the
privilege
of
going
off
duty
and
lying
by
when
you
are
sick
is
one
of
the
few
points
in
which
a
is
far
better
for
the
sailor
than
a
merchantman
but
as
with
every
other
matter
in
the
navy
the
whole
thing
is
subject
to
the
general
discipline
of
the
vessel
and
is
conducted
with
a
severe
unyielding
method
and
regularity
making
no
allowances
for
exceptions
to
rules
during
the
preceding
morning
quarters
the
surgeon
of
a
frigate
is
to
be
found
in
the
where
after
going
his
rounds
among
the
invalids
he
holds
a
levee
for
the
benefit
of
all
new
candidates
for
the
if
after
looking
at
your
tongue
and
feeling
of
your
pulse
he
pronounces
you
a
proper
candidate
his
secretary
puts
you
down
on
his
books
and
you
are
thenceforth
relieved
from
all
duty
and
have
abundant
leisure
in
which
to
recover
your
health
let
the
boatswain
blow
let
the
deck
officer
bellow
let
the
captain
of
your
gun
hunt
you
up
yet
if
it
can
be
answered
by
your
that
you
are
on
the
you
ride
it
all
out
with
impunity
the
commodore
himself
has
then
no
authority
over
you
but
you
must
not
be
too
much
elated
for
your
immunities
are
only
secure
while
you
are
immured
in
the
dark
hospital
below
should
you
venture
to
get
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
on
the
and
be
there
discovered
by
an
officer
you
will
in
vain
plead
your
illness
for
it
is
quite
impossible
it
seems
that
any
true
invalid
can
be
hearty
enough
to
crawl
up
the
ladders
besides
the
raw
sea
air
as
they
will
tell
you
is
not
good
for
the
sick
but
notwithstanding
all
this
notwithstanding
the
darkness
and
closeness
of
the
in
which
an
alleged
invalid
must
be
content
to
shut
himself
up
till
the
surgeon
pronounces
him
cured
many
instances
occur
especially
in
protracted
bad
weather
where
pretended
invalids
will
submit
to
this
dismal
hospital
durance
in
order
to
escape
hard
work
and
wet
jackets
there
is
a
story
told
somewhere
of
the
devil
taking
down
the
confessions
of
a
woman
on
a
strip
of
parchment
and
being
obliged
to
stretch
it
longer
and
longer
with
his
teeth
in
order
to
find
room
for
all
the
lady
had
to
say
much
thus
was
it
with
our
steward
who
had
to
lengthen
out
his
manuscript
in
order
to
accommodate
all
the
names
which
were
presented
to
him
while
we
were
off
the
pitch
of
cape
horn
what
sailors
call
the
horn
alarmingly
prevailed
though
it
disappeared
altogether
when
we
got
into
the
weather
which
as
with
many
other
invalids
was
solely
to
be
imputed
to
the
effects
of
an
entire
change
of
climate
it
seems
very
strange
but
it
is
really
true
that
off
cape
horn
some
of
sailors
will
stand
cupping
and
bleeding
and
blistering
before

there
are
cases
where
a
man
actually
sick
and
in
need
of
medicine
will
refuse
to
go
on

in
that

his

stopped

is
a
goodly

of

various
delicacies
put
on

the

of
the
sick
whether
officers

one
of

reserved
for

on

the

given

was
a
little
sago

so
far
as
i
could
learn
no
wine
in

quantity
was
ever
prescribed
for
them
though
the

bottles
often
went
into

as

dismal
times
in
the
mess
it
was
on
the
first
day
of
the
long
hot
calm
which
we
had
on
the
equator
that
a
of
mine
by
the
name
of
shenly
who
had
been
for
some
weeks
complaining
at
length
went
on
the
an
old
mate
of
the
the
man
with
the
who
true
to
his
tribe
was
charged
to
the
muzzle
with
bile
and
moreover
rammed
home
on
top
of
it
a
wad
of
sailor
mate
indulged
in
some
gloomy
and
savage
tinged
with
genuine
feeling
and
the
announcement
of
the
sickness
of
shenly
coming
as
it
did
not
long
after
the
almost
fatal
accident
befalling
poor
baldy
captain
of
the
another
of
ours
and
the
dreadful
fate
of
the
amputated
whom
we
buried
in
rio
also
our
we
were
seated
at
dinner
between
the
guns
when
the
sad
news
concerning

first
communicated

it
said

mess
you
have
been
the
death
of

poor

and
ruined
baldy

sandwiching

i
would
take

bad
taste
rude
and
unworthy
a
your
back
away
from
that
will

now
jack

cried
priming
in
reply
just
then
jack
happening
to
lean
up
against
it
i
be
all
the
time
cleaning
after
you
fellows
blast
ye
i
spent
an
hour
on
that
this
very
but
it
all

there
if

one
too
many
there
be
any
crowding

jamming
in
the

blessed
if

sake
mate
cried
i
it
will
content
you
i
and
my

wish
you

he
replied
if
he
does
you
will
mess
alone
mate
said
jack
chase
you
will
cried
all
i
wish

the
lord
let

irritably
rubbing
his
head
with
the
handle
of
his

old

mate
said
jack
chase
am
an
old

he
replied
drawing
the
flat
blade
of
his
knife
between
his
teeth
thereby
producing
a
whetting
grating
sound
him
alone
let
him
alone
men
said
jack
chase
keep
off
the
tail
of
a
rattlesnake
and
not
out
he
bite
though
said
priming
snapping
his
teeth
and
with
that
he
rolled
off
growling
as
he
went
though
i
did
my
best
to
carry
off
my
vexation
with
an
air
of
indifference
need
i
say
how
i
cursed
my
jacket
that
it
thus
seemed
the
means
of
fastening
on
me
the
murder
of
one
of
my
shipmates
and
the
probable
murder
of
two
more
for
had
it
not
been
for
my
jacket
doubtless
i
had
yet
been
a
member
of
my
old
mess
and
so
have
escaped
making
the
luckless
odd
number
among
my
present
companions
all
i
could
say
in
private
to
priming
had
no
effect
though
i
often
took
him
aside
to
convince
him
of
the
philosophical
impossibility
of
my
having
been
accessary
to
the
misfortunes
of
baldy
the
buried
sailor
in
rio
and
shenly
but
priming
knew
better
nothing
could
move
him
and
he
ever
afterward
eyed
me
as

chapter
lxxix
how
die
at
sea
shenly
my
sick
was
a
handsome
intelligent
seaman
whom
some
hard
calamity
or
perhaps
some
unfortunate
excess
must
have
driven
into
the
navy
he
told
me
he
had
a
wife
and
two
children
in
portsmouth
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
upon
being
examined
by
cuticle
the
surgeon
he
was
on
purely
scientific
grounds
reprimanded
by
that
functionary
for
not
having
previously
appeared
before
him
he
was
immediately
consigned
to
one
of
the
invalid
cots
as
a
serious
case
his
complaint
was
of
long
standing
a
pulmonary
one
now
attended
with
general
prostration
the
same
evening
he
grew
so
much
worse
that
according
to
usage
we
his
were
officially
notified
that
we
must
take
turns
at
sitting
up
with
him
through
the
night
we
at
once
made
our
arrangements
allotting
two
hours
for
a
watch
not
till
the
third
night
did
my
own
turn
come
round
during
the
day
preceding
it
was
stated
at
the
mess
that
our
poor
was
run
down
completely
the
surgeon
had
given
him
up
at
four
bells
two
in
the
morning
i
went
down
to
relieve
one
of
my
at
the
sick
cot
the
profound
quietude
of
the
calm
pervaded
the
entire
frigate
through
all
her
decks
the
watch
on
duty
were
dozing
on
the
far
above
the
and
the
watch
below
were
fast
asleep
in
their
hammocks
on
the
same
deck
with
the
invalid
groping
my
way
under
these
two
hundred
sleepers
i
entered
the
hospital
a
dim
lamp
was
burning
on
the
table
which
was
screwed
down
to
the
floor
this
light
shed
dreary
shadows
over
the
walls
of
the
place
making
it
look
look
a
whited
sepulchre
underground
the
had
collapsed
and
lay
motionless
on
the
deck
the
low
groans
of
the
sick
were
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
and
as
i
advanced
some
of
them
rolled
upon
me
their
sleepless
silent
tormented
eyes
him
and
keep
his
forehead
wet
with
this
sponge
whispered
my
whom
i
came
to
relieve
as
i
drew
near
to
cot
wash
the
foam
from
his
mouth
nothing
more
can
be
done
for
him
if
he
dies
before
your
watch
is
out
call
the
steward
he
sleeps
in
that
hammock
pointing
it
out
he
then
whispered
stooping
over
the
sick
man
and
so
saying
he
left
the
place
shenly
was
lying
on
his
back
his
eyes
were
closed
forming
two
pits
in
his
face
his
breath
was
coming
and
going
with
a
slow
mechanical
precision
it
was
the
mere
foundering
hull
of
a
man
that
was
before
me
and
though
it
presented
the
features
of
my
yet
i
knew
that
the
living
soul
of
shenly
never
more
would
look
out
of
those
eyes
so
warm
had
it
been
during
the
day
that
the
surgeon
himself
when
visiting
the
had
entered
it
in
his
and
so
warm
was
now
the
night
that
even
in
the
lofty
top
i
had
worn
but
a
loose
linen
frock
and
trowsers
but
in
this
subterranean
buried
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
ship
and
at
sea
cut
off
from
all
ventilation
the
heat
of
the
night
calm
was
intense
the
sweat
dripped
from
me
as
if
i
had
just
emerged
from
a
bath
and
stripping
myself
naked
to
the
waist
i
sat
by
the
side
of
the
cot
and
with
a
bit
of
crumpled
into
my
hand
by
the
sailor
i
had
fanning
the
motionless
white
face
before
me
i
could
not
help
thinking
as
i
gazed
whether
this
fate
had
not
been
accelerated
by
his
confinement
in
this
heated
furnace
below
and
whether
many
a
sick
man
round
me
might
not
soon
improve
if
but
permitted
to
swing
his
hammock
in
the
airy
vacancies
of
the
above
open
to
the
but
reserved
for
the
promenade
of
the
officers
at
last
the
heavy
breathing
grew
more
and
more
irregular
and
gradually
dying
away
left
forever
the
unstirring
form
of
shenly
calling
the
steward
he
at
once
told
me
to
rouse
the
and
four
or
five
of
my
the
approached
and
immediately
demanded
the
dead
bag
which
was
accordingly
dragged
into
the
bay
having
been
laid
on
the
floor
and
washed
with
a
bucket
of
water
which
i
drew
from
the
ocean
the
body
was
then
dressed
in
a
white
frock
trowsers
and
neckerchief
taken
out
of
the
bag
while
this
was
going
on
the
over
the
operation
with
his
rattan
and
directing
myself
and
in
much
discursive
levity
intended
to
manifest
his
fearlessness
of
death
pierre
who
had
been
a
of
spent
much
time
in
tying
the
neckerchief
in
an
elaborate
bow
and
affectionately
adjusting
the
white
frock
and
trowsers
but
the
put
an
end
to
this
by
ordering
us
to
carry
the
body
up
to
the
it
was
placed
on
the
used
for
that
purpose
and
we
proceeded
with
it
toward
the
main
hatchway
awkwardly
crawling
under
the
tiers
of
hammocks
where
the
entire
was
sleeping
as
unavoidably
we
rocked
their
pallets
the
would
cry
out
against
us
through
the
mutterings
of
curses
the
corpse
reached
the
hatchway
here
the
board
slipped
and
some
time
was
spent
in
readjusting
the
body
at
length
we
deposited
it
on
the
between
two
guns
and
a
being
thrown
over
it
for
a
pall
i
was
left
again
to
watch
by
its
side
i
had
not
been
seated
on
my
three
minutes
when
the
passed
me
on
his
way
forward
presently
the
slow
regular
stroke
of
the
great
bell
was
heard
proclaiming
through
the
calm
the
expiration
of
the
watch
it
was
four
in
the
morning
poor
shenly
thought
i
that
sounds
like
your
knell
and
here
you
lie
becalmed
in
the
last
calm
of
all
hardly
had
the
brazen
din
died
away
when
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
mustered
round
the
hatchway
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
corpse
and
the
usual
thundering
call
was
given
for
the
watch
below
to
turn
out
the
ahoy
on
deck
there
below
wide
awake
there
sleepers
but
the
dreamless
sleeper
by
my
side
who
had
so
often
sprung
from
his
hammock
at
that
summons
moved
not
a
limb
the
blue
sheet
over
him
lay
unwrinkled
a
of
the
other
watch
now
came
to
relieve
me
but
i
told
him
i
chose
to
remain
where
i
was
till
daylight
came
chapter
lxxx
the
last
stitch
just
before
daybreak
two
of
the
gang
drew
near
each
with
a
lantern
carrying
some
canvas
two
large
shot
needles
and
twine
i
knew
their
errand
for
in
the
is
the
undertaker
they
laid
the
body
on
deck
and
after
fitting
the
canvas
to
it
seated
themselves
like
tailors
one
on
each
side
and
with
their
lanterns
before
them
went
to
stitching
away
as
if
mending
an
old
sail
both
were
old
men
with
grizzled
hair
and
beard
and
shrunken
faces
they
belonged
to
that
small
class
of
aged
seamen
who
for
their
previous
long
and
faithful
services
are
retained
in
the
navy
more
as
pensioners
upon
its
merited
bounty
than
anything

they
like
on
i
was
standing
leaning
over
a
gun
gazing
at
the
two
old
men
the
last
remark
reminded
me
of
a
superstitious
custom
generally
practised
by
most
upon
these
occasions
i
resolved
that
if
i
could
help
it
it
should
not
take
place
upon
the
remains
of
shenly
said
i
advancing
to
the
last
speaker

right
that
last
thing

said
thrummings
as
his

quivering
over
the
canvas

that
to
yourself
old
man
replied
ringrope
stooping
close
to
the
light
to
thread
his
coarse
needle
which
trembled
in
his
withered
hands
like
the
needle
in
a
compass
of
a
greenland
ship
near
the
pole
long
for

there
is
something
in

that
ennobles

the

stood
bareheaded

some

declared

their

were
somewhat
puzzled
by
the
questions
of
the

a
third
party
came
along

declared

of

there
were
two
academies
in
the

one
comprised
the
apprentice
boys
who
upon
certain
days
of
the
week
were
indoctrinated
in
the
mysteries
of
the
primer
by
an
invalid
corporal
of
marines
a
slender
man
who
had
received
a
liberal
education
the
other
school
was
a
far
more
pretentious
sort
of
army
and
navy
seminary
combined
where
mystical
mathematical
problems
were
solved
by
the
midshipmen
and
great
were
navigated
over
imaginary
shoals
by
unimaginable
observations
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
learned
lectures
were
delivered
upon
great
guns
small
arms
and
the
curvilinear
lines
described
by
bombs

was
the
title
bestowed
upon
the
erudite
gentleman
who
conducted
this
seminary
and
by
that
title
alone
was
he
known
throughout
the
ship
he
was
domiciled
in
the
and
circulated
there
on
a
social
par
with
the
purser
surgeon
and
other
and
quakers
by
being
advanced
to
the
dignity
of
a
peerage

the
science
and
learning
were
ennobled
in
the
person
of
this
professor
even
as
divinity
was
honoured
in
the
chaplain
enjoying
the
rank
of
a
spiritual
peer
every
other
afternoon
while
at
sea
the
professor
assembled
his
pupils
on
the
near
the
long
pounders
a
bass
was
his
desk
his
pupils
forming
a
semicircle
around
him
seated
on
and
they
were
in
the
jelly
of
youth
and
this
learned
professor
poured
into
their
susceptible
hearts
all
the
gentle
gunpowder
maxims
of
war
presidents
of
peace
societies
and
superintendents
of
must
it
not
have
been
a
most
interesting
sight
but
the
professor
himself
was
a
noteworthy
person
a
tall
thin
spectacled
man
about
forty
years
old
with
a
stoop
in
his
shoulders
and
wearing
uncommonly
scanty
pantaloons
exhibiting
an
undue
proportion
of
his
boots
in
early
life
he
had
been
a
cadet
in
the
military
academy
of
west
point
but
becoming
very
and
thereby
in
a
good
manner
disqualified
for
active
service
in
the
field
he
had
declined
entering
the
army
and
accepted
the
office
of
professor
in
the
navy
his
studies
at
west
point
had
thoroughly
grounded
him
in
a
knowledge
of
gunnery
and
as
he
was
not
a
little
of
a
pedant
it
was
sometimes
amusing
when
the
sailors
were
at
quarters
to
hear
him
criticise
their
evolutions
at
the
batteries
he
would
quote
tracts
on
the
subject
also
in
the
original
french
and
wind
up
by
italian
passages
from
the
manuale
though
not
required
by
the
navy
regulations
to
instruct
his
scholars
in
aught
but
the
application
of
mathematics
to
navigation
yet
besides
this
and
besides
instructing
them
in
the
theory
of
gunnery
he
also
sought
to
root
them
in
the
theory
of
frigate
and
fleet
tactics
to
be
sure
he
himself
did
not
know
how
to
splice
a
rope
or
furl
a
sail
and
owing
to
his
partiality
for
strong
coffee
he
was
apt
to
be
nervous
when
we
fired
salutes
yet
all
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
delivering
lectures
on
cannonading
and
the
he
had
arrived
at
his
knowledge
of
tactics
by
silent
solitary
study
and
earnest
meditation
in
the
sequestered
retreat
of
his
his
case
was
somewhat
parallel
to
the
clerk
of
though
he
had
never
been
to
sea
composed
a
quarto
treatise
on
which
to
this
day
remains
a
and
he
also
originated
a
nautical
manoeuvre
which
has
given
to
england
many
a
victory
over
her
foes
now
there
was
a
large
something
like
a
it
was
during
the
lectures
was
placed
upright
on
the
supported
behind
by
three
and
here
he
would
chalk
out
diagrams
of
great
fleet
engagements
making
marks
like
the
soles
of
shoes
for
the
ships
and
drawing
a
in
one
corner
to
denote
the
assumed
direction
of
the
wind
this
done
with
a
cutlass
he
would
point
out
every
spot
of
interest
young
gentlemen
the
board
before
you
exhibits
the
disposition
of
the
british
west
indian
squadron
under
rodney
when
early
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
in
the
year
of
our
blessed
lord
he
discovered
part
of
the
french
fleet
commanded
by
the
count
de
grasse
lying
under
the
north
end
of
the
island
of
dominica
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
the
admiral
gave
the
signal
for
the
british
line
to
prepare
for
battle
and
stand
on
understand
young
gentlemen
well
the
british
van
having
nearly
fetched
up
with
the
centre
of
the

it
remembered
were
then
on
the
starboard
centre
and
rear
being
yet
becalmed
under
the
lee
of
the
question
i
ask
you
is
what
should
rodney
now
do
away
by
all
means
responded
a
rather
confident
reefer
who
had
zealously
been
observing
the
diagram
sir
his
centre
and
rear
are
still
becalmed
and
his
van
has
not
yet
closed
with
the
till
he
come
in
range
and
blaze
away
said
the
reefer
me
to
remark
pert
that
is
not
a
strictly
technical
term
and
also
permit
me
to
hint
pert
that
you
should
consider
the
subject
rather
more
deeply
before
you
hurry
forward
your
this
rebuke
not
only
abashed
pert
but
for
a
time
intimidated
the
rest
and
the
professor
was
obliged
to
proceed
and
extricate
the
british
fleet
by
himself
he
concluded
by
awarding
admiral
rodney
the
victory
which
must
have
been
exceedingly
gratifying
to
the
family
pride
of
the
surviving
relatives
and
connections
of
that
distinguished
hero
i
clean
the
board
sir
now
asked
pert
brightening
up
sir
not
till
you
have
saved
that
crippled
french
ship
in
the
corner
that
ship
young
gentlemen
is
the
glorieuse
you
perceive
she
is
cut
off
from
her
consorts
and
the
whole
british
fleet
is
giving
chase
to
her
her
bowsprit
is
gone
her
rudder
is
torn
away
she
has
one
hundred
round
shot
in
her

two

of
her
men
are
dead

dying

be
done

mr

a
chivalric
young
gentleman
from
virginia
strike

my
colours
to
the
i

mr

service

be
i
should
like
to
know
mr

tell
exactly
but
i
think
it
would
help
her
a
little
was
the
timid

your

lying
across
your

your

me
inform
you

sir
cried
mr
dash
tack
ship
anyway
bid
with
a
broadside
nail
my
flag
to
the
keel
if
there
was
no
other
place
and
blow
my
brains
out
on
the
poop
idle
sir
worse
than
idle
you
are
carried
away
mr
dash
by
your
ardent
southern
temperament
let
me
inform
you
young
gentlemen
that
this
ship
touching
it
with
his
cutlass
be
then
throwing
down
his
cutlass
pert
have
the
goodness
to
hand
me
one
of
those
from
the
balancing
the
iron
sphere
in
one
hand
the
learned
professor
began
fingering
it
with
the
other
like
columbus
illustrating
the
rotundity
of
the
globe
before
the
royal
commission
of
castilian
ecclesiastics
gentlemen
i
resume
my
remarks
on
the
passage
of
a
shot
which
remarks
were
interrupted
yesterday
by
general
quarters
after
quoting
that
admirable
passage
in
british
gunner
i
then
laid
it
down
you
remember
that
the
path
of
a
shot
describes
a
parabolic
curve
i
now
add
that
agreeably
to
the
method
pursued
by
the
illustrious
newton
in
treating
the
subject
of
curvilinear
motion
i
consider
the
or
curve
described
by
a
moving
body
in
space
as
consisting
of
a
series
of
right
lines
described
in
successive
intervals
of
time
and
constituting
the
diagonals
of
parallelograms
formed
in
a
vertical
plane
between
the
vertical
deflections
caused
by
gravity
and
the
production
of
the
line
of
motion
which
has
been
described
in
each
preceding
interval
of
time
this
must
be
obvious
for
if
you
say
that
the
passage
of
this
now
held
in
my
hand
would
describe
otherwise
than
a
series
of
right
lines
then
you
are
brought
to
the
ad
that
the
diagonals
of
parallelograms
hands
reef
was
now
thundered
forth
by
the
mates
the
shot
fell
from
the
palm
his
spectacles
dropped
on
his
nose
and
the
school
tumultuously
broke
up
the
pupils
scrambling
up
the
ladders
with
the
sailors
who
had
been
overhearing
the
lecture
chapter
lxxxiv
barbers
the
allusion
to
one
of
the
barbers
in
a
previous
chapter
together
with
the
recollection
of
how
conspicuous
a
part
they
enacted
in
a
tragical
drama
soon
to
be
related
leads
me
now
to
introduce
them
to
the
reader
among
the
numerous
artists
and
professors
of
polite
trades
in
the
navy
none
are
held
in
higher
estimation
or
drive
a
more
profitable
business
than
these
barbers
and
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
the
five
hundred
heads
of
hair
and
five
hundred
beards
of
a
frigate
should
furnish
no
small
employment
for
those
to
whose
faithful
care
they
may
be
intrusted
as
everything
connected
with
the
domestic
affairs
of
a
comes
under
the
supervision
of
the
martial
executive
so
certain
barbers
are
formally
licensed
by
the
first
lieutenant
the
better
to
attend
to
the
profitable
duties
of
their
calling
they
are
exempted
from
all
duty
except
that
of
standing
at
sea
mustering
at
quarters
and
coming
on
deck
when
all
hands
are
called
they
are
rated
as
or
and
receive
their
wages
as
such
but
in
addition
to
this
they
are
liberally
recompensed
for
their
professional
services
herein
their
rate
of
pay
is
fixed
for
every
sailor
much
per
quarter
which
is
charged
to
the
sailor
and
credited
to
his
barber
on
the
books
of
the
purser
it
has
been
seen
that
while
a
barber
is
shaving
his
customers
at
so
much
per
chin
his
wages
as
a
seaman
are
still
running
on
which
makes
him
a
sort
of
of
a
sailor
nor
are
the
sailor
wages
he
receives
altogether
to
be
reckoned
as
earnings
considering
the
circumstances
however
not
much
objection
can
be
made
to
the
barbers
on
this
score
but
there
were
instances
of
men
in
the
neversink
receiving
government
money
in
part
pay
for
work
done
for
private
individuals
among
these
were
several
accomplished
tailors
who
nearly
the
whole
cruise
sat
on
the
half
deck
making
coats
pantaloons
and
vests
for
the
officers
some
of
these
men
though
knowing
little
or
nothing
about
sailor
duties
and
seldom
or
never
performing
them
stood
upon
the
books
as
ordinary
seamen
entitled
to
ten
dollars
a
month
why
was
this
previous
to
shipping
they
had
divulged
the
fact
of
their
being
tailors
true
the
officers
who
employed
them
upon
their
wardrobes
paid
them
for
their
work
but
some
of
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
elicit
much
grumbling
from
the
tailors
at
any
rate
these
makers
and
menders
of
clothes
did
not
receive
from
some
of
these
officers
an
amount
equal
to
what
they
could
have
fairly
earned
ashore
by
doing
the
same
work
it
was
a
considerable
saving
to
the
officers
to
have
their
clothes
made
on
board
the
men
belonging
to
the
gang
furnished
another
case
in
point
there
were
some
six
or
eight
allotted
to
this
department
all
the
cruise
they
were
hard
at
work
at
what
mostly
making
chests
of
drawers
canes
little
ships
and
schooners
swifts
and
other
elaborated
trifles
chiefly
for
the
captain
what
did
the
captain
pay
them
for
their
trouble
nothing
but
the
united
states
government
paid
them
two
of
them
the
mates
at
nineteen
dollars
a
month
and
the
rest
receiving
the
pay
of
able
seamen
twelve
dollars
to
return
the
regular
days
upon
which
the
barbers
shall
exercise
their
vocation
are
set
down
on
the
calendar
and
known
as
on
board
of
the
neversink
these
days
are
wednesdays
and
saturdays
when
immediately
after
breakfast
the
shops
were
opened
to
customers
they
were
in
different
parts
of
the
between
the
long
pounders
their
furniture
however
was
not
very
elaborate
hardly
equal
to
the
sumptuous
appointments
of
metropolitan
barbers
indeed
it
merely
consisted
of
a
elevated
upon
a
as
a
chair
for
the
patient
no
psyche
glasses
no
no
ewer
and
basin
no
comfortable
padded
footstool
nothing
in
short
that
makes
a
shore
such
a
luxury
nor
are
the
implements
of
these
barbers
out
of
keeping
with
the
rude
appearance
of
their
shops
their
razors
are
of
the
simplest
patterns
and
from
their
would
seem
better
fitted
for
the
preparing
and
harrowing
of
the
soil
than
for
the
ultimate
reaping
of
the
crop
but
this
is
no
matter
for
wonder
since
so
many
chins
are
to
be
shaven
and
a
holds
but
two
razors
for
only
two
razors
does
a
barber
have
and
like
the
marine
sentries
at
the
gangway
in
port
these
razors
go
off
and
on
duty
in
rotation
one
brush
too
brushes
every
chin
and
one
lather
lathers
them
all
no
private
brushes
and
boxes
no
reservations
whatever
as
it
would
be
altogether
too
much
trouble
for
a
to
keep
his
own
and
shave
himself
at
sea
and
since
therefore
nearly
the
whole
company
patronise
the
barbers
and
as
the
seamen
must
be
shaven
by
evening
quarters
of
the
days
appointed
for
the
business
it
may
be
readily
imagined
what
a
scene
of
bustle
and
confusion
there
is
when
the
razors
are
being
applied
first
come
first
served
is
the
motto
and
often
you
have
to
wait
for
hours
together
sticking
to
your
position
like
one
of
an
indian
file
of
clerks
getting
letters
out
of
the
ere
you
have
a
chance
to
occupy
the
pedestal
of
the
often
the
crowd
of
quarrelsome
candidates
wrangle
and
fight
for
precedency
while
at
all
times
the
interval
is
employed
by
the
garrulous
in
every
variety
of
as
the
shaving
days
are
unalterable
they
often
fall
upon
days
of
high
seas
and
tempestuous
winds
when
the
vessel
pitches
and
rolls
in
a
frightful
manner
in
consequence
many
valuable
lives
are
jeopardised
from
the
razor
being
plied
under
such
untoward
circumstances
but
these
pride
themselves
upon
their
and
often
you
will
see
them
standing
over
their
patients
with
their
feet
wide
apart
and
scientifically
swaying
their
bodies
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
as
they
flourish
their
about
the
lips
nostrils
and
jugular
as
i
looked
upon
the
practitioner
and
patient
at
such
times
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
the
sailor
had
any
insurance
on
his
life
it
would
certainly
be
deemed
forfeited
should
the
president
of
the
company
chance
to
lounge
by
and
behold
him
in
that
imminent
peril
for
myself
i
accounted
it
an
excellent
preparation
for
going
into
a
where
fortitude
in
standing
up
to
your
gun
and
running
the
risk
of
all
splinters
comprise
part
of
the
practical
qualities
that
make
up
an
efficient
man
it
remains
to
be
related
that
these
barbers
of
ours
had
their
labours
considerably
abridged
by
a
fashion
prevailing
among
many
of
the
crew
of
wearing
very
large
whiskers
so
that
in
most
cases
the
only
parts
needing
a
shave
were
the
upper
lip
and
suburbs
of
the
chin
this
had
been
more
or
less
the
custom
during
the
whole
three
cruise
but
for
some
time
previous
to
our
weathering
cape
horn
very
many
of
the
seamen
had
redoubled
their
assiduity
in
cultivating
their
beards
preparatory
to
their
return
to
america
there
they
anticipated
creating
no
small
impression
by
their
immense
and
magnificent
they
called
the
long
at
their
chins
in
particular
the
more
aged
sailors
embracing
the
old
guard
of
sea
grenadiers
on
the
forecastle
and
the
begrimed
mates
and
sported
most
venerable
beards
of
an
exceeding
length
and
hoariness
like
long
trailing
moss
hanging
from
the
bough
of
some
aged
oak
above
all
the
captain
of
the
forecastle
old
fine
specimen
of
a
sea
a
wide
spreading
beard
gizzled
and
grey
that
flowed
over
his
breast
and
often
became
tangled
and
knotted
with
tar
this
ushant
in
all
weathers
was
ever
alert
at
his
duty
intrepidly
mounting
the
in
a
gale
his
long
beard
streaming
like
off
cape
horn
it
looked
like
a
being
all
over
powdered
with
frost
sometimes
it
glittered
with
minute
icicles
in
the
pale
cold
moonlit
patagonian
nights
but
though
he
was
so
active
in
time
of
tempest
yet
when
his
duty
did
not
call
for
exertion
he
was
a
remarkably
staid
reserved
silent
and
majestic
old
man
holding
himself
aloof
from
noisy
revelry
and
never
participating
in
the
boisterous
sports
of
the
crew
he
resolutely
set
his
beard
against
their
boyish
frolickings
and
often
held
forth
like
an
oracle
concerning
the
vanity
thereof
indeed
at
times
he
was
wont
to
talk
philosophy
to
his
ancient
old
around
well
as
to
the
tenants
of
the
and
the
giddy
lads
in
the
mizzen
nor
was
his
philosophy
to
be
despised
it
abounded
in
wisdom
for
this
ushant
was
an
old
man
of
strong
natural
sense
who
had
seen
nearly
the
whole
terraqueous
globe
and
could
reason
of
civilized
and
savage
of
gentile
and
jew
of
christian
and
moslem
the
long
of
the
sailor
are
eminently
adapted
to
draw
out
the
reflective
faculties
of
any
man
however
humble
or
uneducated
judge
then
what
half
a
century
of
battling
out
watches
on
the
ocean
must
have
done
for
this
fine
old
tar
he
was
a
sort
of
a
in
his
old
age
out
his
last
philosophy
and
life
as
sweet
spenser
has
it
and
i
never
could
look
at
him
and
survey
his
right
reverend
beard
without
bestowing
upon
him
that
title
which
in
one
of
his
satires
persius
gives
to
the
immortal
quaffer
of
the
bearded
master
not
a
few
of
the
company
had
also
bestowed
great
pains
upon
their
hair
which
some
of
the
genteel
young
sailor
bucks
of
the
over
their
shoulders
like
the
ringleted
cavaliers
many
sailors
with
naturally
tendril
locks
prided
themselves
upon
what
they
call
worn
at
the
side
of
the
head
just
before
the
custom
peculiar
to
tars
and
which
seems
to
have
filled
the
vacated
place
of
the
lord
rodney
cue
which
they
used
to
wear
some
fifty
years
ago
but
there
were
others
of
the
crew
labouring
under
the
misfortune
of
long
lank
winnebago
locks
carroty
bunches
of
hair
or
rebellious
bristles
of
a
sandy
hue
ambitious
of
redundant
mops
these
still
suffered
their
carrots
to
grow
spite
of
all
ridicule
they
looked
like
huns
and
scandinavians
and
one
of
them
a
young
down
easter
the
unenvied
proprietor
of
a
thick
crop
of
inflexible
yellow
bamboos
went
by
the
name
of
the
wild
for
like
peter
the
wild
boy
in
france
it
was
supposed
that
he
must
have
been
caught
like
a
catamount
in
the
pine
woods
of
maine
but
there
were
many
fine
flowing
heads
of
hair
to
such
sorry
exhibitions
as
what
with
long
whiskers
and
venerable
beards
then
of
every
variety
of
the
and
endless
and
and
what
with
abounding
locks
our
crew
seemed
a
company
of
merovingians
or
kings
mixed
with
savage
lombards
or
longobardi
so
called
from
their
lengthy
beards
chapter
lxxxv
the
great
massacre
of
the
beards
the
preceding
chapter
fitly
paves
the
way
for
the
present
wherein
it
sadly
befalls
to
chronicle
a
calamitous
event
which
filled
the
neversink
with
long
lamentations
that
echo
through
all
her
decks
and
tops
after
dwelling
upon
our
redundant
locks
and
beards
fain
would
i
cease
and
let
the
sequel
remain
undisclosed
but
truth
and
fidelity
forbid
as
i
now
deviously
hover
and
lingeringly
skirmish
about
the
frontiers
of
this
melancholy
recital
a
feeling
of
sadness
comes
over
me
that
i
can
not
withstand
such
a
heartless
massacre
of
hair
such
a
day
and
sicilian
vespers
of
assassinated
beards
ah
who
would
believe
it
with
intuitive
sympathy
i
feel
of
my
own
brown
beard
while
i
write
and
thank
my
kind
stars
that
each
precious
hair
is
for
ever
beyond
the
reach
of
the
ruthless
barbers
of
a
it
needs
that
this
sad
and
most
serious
matter
should
be
faithfully
detailed
throughout
the
cruise
many
of
the
officers
had
expressed
their
abhorrence
of
the
impunity
with
which
the
most
extensive
plantations
of
hair
were
cultivated
under
their
very
noses
and
they
frowned
upon
every
beard
with
even
greater
dislike
they
said
it
was
unseamanlike
not
in
short
it
was
disgraceful
to
the
navy
but
as
captain
claret
said
nothing
and
as
the
officers
of
themselves
had
no
authority
to
preach
a
crusade
against
whiskerandoes
the
old
guard
on
the
forecastle
still
complacently
stroked
their
beards
and
the
sweet
youths
of
the
still
lovingly
threaded
their
fingers
through
their
curls
perhaps
the
generosity
in
thus
far
permitting
our
beards
sprung
from
the
fact
that
he
himself
wore
a
small
speck
of
a
beard
upon
his
own
imperial
cheek
which
if
rumour
said
true
was
to
hide
something
as
plutarch
relates
of
the
emperor
adrian
but
to
do
him
i
always
have
beard
did
not
exceed
the
limits
prescribed
by
the
navy
department
according
to
a
then
recent
ordinance
at
washington
the
beards
of
both
officers
and
seamen
were
to
be
accurately
laid
out
and
surveyed
and
on
no
account
must
come
lower
than
the
mouth
so
as
to
correspond
with
the
army
regulation
directly
opposed
to
the
theocratical
law
laid
down
in
the
nineteenth
chapter
and
verse
of
leviticus
where
it
is
expressly
ordained
shalt
not
mar
the
corners
of
thy
but
legislators
do
not
always
square
their
statutes
by
those
of
the
bible
at
last
when
we
had
crossed
the
northern
tropic
and
were
standing
up
to
our
guns
at
evening
quarters
and
when
the
setting
sun
streaming
in
at
the
lit
up
every
hair
till
to
an
observer
on
the
the
two
long
even
lines
of
beards
seemed
one
dense
grove
in
that
evil
hour
it
must
have
been
that
a
cruel
thought
entered
into
the
heart
of
our
captain
a
pretty
set
of
savages
thought
he
am
i
taking
home
to
america
people
will
think
them
all
catamounts
and
turks
besides
now
that
i
think
of
it
against
the
law
it
will
never
do
they
must
be
shaven
and
flat
there
is
no
knowing
indeed
whether
these
were
the
very
words
in
which
the
captain
meditated
that
night
for
it
is
yet
a
mooted
point
among
metaphysicians
whether
we
think
in
words
or
whether
we
think
in
thoughts
but
something
like
the
above
must
have
been
the
cogitations
at
any
rate
that
very
evening
the
company
were
astounded
by
an
extraordinary
announcement
made
at
the
of
the
by
the
mate
there
stationed
he
was
afterwards
discovered
to
have
been
tipsy
at
the
time
hear
there
fore
and
aft
all
you
that
have
hair
on
your
heads
shave
them
off
and
all
you
that
have
beards
trim
small
shave
off
our
christian
heads
and
then
placing
them
between
our
knees
trim
small
our
worshipped
beards
the
captain
was
mad
but
directly
the
boatswain
came
rushing
to
the
hatchway
and
after
soundly
rating
his
tipsy
mate
thundered
forth
a
true
version
of
the
order
that
had
issued
from
the
as
amended
it
ran
thus
hear
there
fore
and
aft
all
you
that
have
long
hair
cut
it
short
and
all
you
that
have
large
whiskers
trim
them
down
according
to
the
navy
this
was
an
amendment
to
be
sure
but
what
barbarity
after
all
what
not
thirty
run
from
home
and
lose
our
magnificent
the
we
had
been
cultivating
so
long
lose
them
at
one
fell
swoop
were
the
vile
barbers
of
the
to
reap
our
long
nodding
harvests
and
expose
our
innocent
chins
to
the
chill
air
of
the
yankee
coast
and
our
viny
locks
were
they
also
to
be
shorn
was
a
grand
such
as
they
annually
have
at
nantucket
to
take
place
and
our
ignoble
barbers
to
carry
off
the
fleece
captain
claret
in
cutting
our
beards
and
our
hair
you
cut
us
the
unkindest
cut
of
all
were
we
going
into
action
captain
to
fight
the
foe
with
our
hearts
of
flame
and
our
arms
of
steel
then
would
we
gladly
offer
up
our
beards
to
the
terrific
god
of
war
and
we
would
account
but
a
wise
precaution
against
having
them
tweaked
by
the
foe
captain
claret
you
would
but
be
imitating
the
example
of
alexander
who
had
his
macedonians
all
shaven
that
in
the
hour
of
battle
their
beards
might
not
be
handles
to
the
persians
but
captain
claret
when
after
our
long
long
cruise
we
are
returning
to
our
homes
tenderly
stroking
the
fine
tassels
on
our
chins
and
thinking
of
father
or
mother
or
sister
or
brother
or
daughter
or
son
to
cut
off
our
beards
very
beards
that
were
frosted
white
off
the
pitch
of
is
too
bitterly
bad
captain
claret
and
by
heaven
we
will
not
submit
train
your
guns
inboard
let
the
marines
fix
their
bayonets
let
the
officers
draw
their
swords
we
let
our
beards
be
last
insult
inflicted
upon
a
vanquished
foe
in
the
east
where
are
you
captains
of
the
tops
mates
mariners
all
muster
round
the
capstan
your
venerable
beards
and
while
you
braid
them
together
in
token
of
brotherhood
cross
hands
and
swear
that
we
will
enact
over
again
the
mutiny
of
the
nore
and
sooner
perish
than
yield
up
a
hair
the
excitement
was
intense
throughout
that
whole
evening
groups
of
tens
and
twenties
were
scattered
about
all
the
decks
discussing
the
mandate
and
inveighing
against
its
barbarous
author
the
long
area
of
the
was
something
like
a
populous
street
of
brokers
when
some
terrible
commercial
tidings
have
newly
arrived
one
and
all
they
resolved
not
to
succumb
and
every
man
swore
to
stand
by
his
beard
and
his
neighbour
hours
the
next
evening
eye
was
observed
to
wander
along
the
men
at
their
a
beard
was
shaven
when
the
drum
beat
the
retreat
the
attended
by
all
four
of
his
mates
to
give
additional
solemnity
to
the
the
previous
order
and
concluded
by
saying
that
hours
would
be
given
for
all
to
acquiesce
but
the
second
day
passed
and
at
quarters
untouched
every
beard
bristled
on
its
chin
forthwith
captain
claret
summoned
the
midshipmen
who
receiving
his
orders
hurried
to
the
various
divisions
of
the
guns
and
communicated
them
to
the
lieutenants
respectively
stationed
over
divisions
the
officer
commanding
mine
turned
upon
us
and
said
if
tomorrow
night
i
find
any
of
you
with
long
hair
or
whiskers
of
a
standard
violating
the
navy
regulations
the
names
of
such
offenders
shall
be
put
down
on
the
the
affair
had
now
assumed
a
most
serious
aspect
the
captain
was
in
earnest
the
excitement
increased
and
a
great
many
of
the
older
seamen
exasperated
to
the
uttermost
talked
about
of
till
the
obnoxious
mandate
was
revoked
i
thought
it
impossible
that
they
would
seriously
think
of
such
a
folly
but
there
is
no
knowing
what
will
sometimes
do
under
parker
and
the
nore
that
same
night
when
the
first
watch
was
set
the
men
in
a
body
drove
the
two
mates
from
their
stations
at
the
fore
and
main
hatchways
and
unshipped
the
ladders
thus
cutting
off
all
communication
between
the
gun
and
spar
decks
forward
of
the
mad
jack
had
the
trumpet
and
no
sooner
was
this
incipient
mutiny
reported
to
him
than
he
jumped
right
down
among
the
mob
and
fearlessly
mingling
with
them
exclaimed
do
you
mean
men
be
fools
this
is
no
way
to
get
what
you
want
turn
to
my
lads
turn
to
mate
ship
that
ladder
so
up
you
tumble
now
my
hearties
away
you
go
his
gallant
confident
manner
recognising
no
attempt
at
mutiny
operated
upon
the
sailors
like
magic
they
as
commanded
and
for
the
rest
of
that
night
contented
themselves
with
privately
fulminating
their
displeasure
against
the
captain
and
publicly
emblazoning
every
on
the
coat
of
admired
mad
jack
captain
claret
happened
to
be
taking
a
nap
in
his
cabin
at
the
moment
of
the
disturbance
and
it
was
quelled
so
soon
that
he
knew
nothing
of
it
till
it
was
officially
reported
to
him
it
was
afterward
rumoured
through
the
ship
that
he
reprimanded
mad
jack
for
acting
as
he
did
he
maintained
that
he
should
at
once
have
summoned
the
marines
and
charged
upon
the
but
if
the
sayings
imputed
to
the
captain
were
true
he
nevertheless
refrained
from
subsequently
noticing
the
disturbance
or
attempting
to
seek
out
and
punish
the
ringleaders
this
was
but
wise
for
there
are
times
when
even
the
most
potent
governor
must
wink
at
transgression
in
order
to
preserve
the
laws
inviolate
for
the
future
and
great
care
is
to
be
taken
by
timely
management
to
avert
an
incontestable
act
of
mutiny
and
so
prevent
men
from
being
roused
by
their
own
consciousness
of
transgression
into
all
the
fury
of
an
unbounded
insurrection
for
the
time
both
soldiers
and
sailors
are
irresistible
as
even
the
valour
of
caesar
was
made
to
know
and
the
prudence
of
germanicus
when
their
legions
rebelled
and
not
all
the
concessions
of
earl
spencer
as
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
nor
the
threats
and
entreaties
of
lord
bridport
the
admiral
of
the
nor
his
gracious
plenary
pardon
in
prospective
could
prevail
upon
the
spithead
mutineers
when
at
last
fairly
lashed
up
to
the
mark
to
succumb
until
deserted
by
their
own
and
a
handful
was
left
in
the
breach
therefore
mad
jack
you
did
right
and
no
one
else
could
have
acquitted
himself
better
by
your
crafty
simplicity
daring
and
air
as
if
nothing
was
happening
you
perhaps
quelled
a
very
serious
affair
in
the
bud
and
prevented
the
disgrace
to
the
american
navy
of
a
tragical
mutiny
growing
out
of
whiskers
and
razors
think
of
it
if
future
historians
should
devote
a
long
chapter
to
the
great
of
the
on
board
the
united
states
ship
neversink
why
through
all
time
thereafter
barbers
would
cut
down
their
spiralised
poles
and
substitute
miniature
for
the
emblems
of
their
calling
and
here
is
ample
scope
for
some
pregnant
instruction
how
that
events
of
vast
magnitude
in
our
world
may
originate
in
the
pettiest
of
trifles
but
that
is
an
old
theme
we
waive
it
and
proceed
on
the
morning
following
though
it
was
not
a
regular
shaving
day
the
barbers
were
observed
to
have
their
shops
open
their
accommodations
in
readiness
and
their
razors
displayed
with
their
brushes
raising
a
mighty
lather
in
their
tin
pots
they
stood
eyeing
the
passing
throng
of
seamen
silently
inviting
them
to
walk
in
and
be
served
in
addition
to
their
usual
implements
they
now
flourished
at
intervals
a
huge
pair
of
by
way
of
more
forcibly
reminding
the
men
of
the
edict
which
that
day
must
be
obeyed
or
woe
betide
them
for
some
hours
the
seamen
paced
to
and
fro
in
no
very
good
humour
vowing
not
to
sacrifice
a
hair
beforehand
they
denounced
that
man
who
should
abase
himself
by
compliance
but
habituation
to
discipline
is
magical
and
ere
long
an
old
was
discovered
elevated
upon
a
while
with
a
malicious
grin
his
fellow
who
from
his
merciless
rasping
was
called
him
by
his
long
beard
and
at
one
fell
stroke
cut
it
off
and
tossed
it
out
of
the
behind
him
this
was
ever
afterwards
known
by
a
significant
the
main
equivalent
to
that
name
of
reproach
fastened
upon
that
athenian
who
in
time
previous
to
which
all
the
greeks
sported
beards
first
submitted
to
the
deprivation
of
his
own
but
spite
of
all
the
contempt
hurled
on
our
so
prudent
an
example
was
soon
followed
presently
all
the
barbers
were
busy
sad
sight
at
which
any
one
but
a
barber
or
a
tartar
would
have
wept
beards
three
years
old
that
would
have
graced
a
chamois
of
the
alps
that
count
would
have
envied
and
and
ringlets
that
would
have
measured
inch
for
inch
with
the
longest
tresses
of
the
fair

the
golden

by
the
board
captain
claret
how
can
you
rest
in
your
hammock
by
this
brown
beard
which
now
waves
from
my
illustrious
successor
to
that
first
young
vigorous
beard
i
yielded
to
your
this
manly
beard
i
swear
it
was
barbarous
my
noble
captain
jack
chase
was
indignant
not
even
all
the
special
favours
he
had
received
from
captain
claret
and
the
plenary
pardon
extended
to
him
for
his
desertion
into
the
peruvian
service
could
restrain
the
expression
of
his
feelings
but
in
his
cooler
moments
jack
was
a
wise
man
he
at
last
deemed
it
but
wisdom
to
succumb
when
he
went
to
the
barber
he
almost
drew
tears
from
his
eyes
seating
himself
mournfully
on
the
he
looked
sideways
and
said
to
the
barber
who
was
his
in
readiness
to
begin
friend
i
trust
your
scissors
are
consecrated
let
them
not
touch
this
beard
if
they
have
yet
to
be
dipped
in
holy
water
beards
are
sacred
things
barber
have
you
no
feeling
for
beards
my
friend
think
of
it
and
mournfully
he
laid
his
russet
cheek
upon
his
hand
summers
have
gone
by
since
my
chin
has
been
reaped
i
was
in
coquimbo
then
on
the
spanish
main
and
when
the
was
sowing
his
autumnal
grain
on
the
vega
i
started
this
blessed
beard
and
when
the
were
trimming
their
vines
in
the
vineyards
i
first
trimmed
it
to
the
sound
of
a
flute
ah
barber
have
you
no
heart
this
beard
has
been
caressed
by
the
hand
of
the
lovely
tomasita
of
castilian
belle
of
all
lower
peru
think
of
barber
i
have
worn
it
as
an
officer
on
the
of
a
peruvian
i
have
sported
it
at
brilliant
fandangoes
in
lima
i
have
been
alow
and
aloft
with
it
at
sea
yea
barber
it
has
streamed
like
an
pennant
at
the
of
this
same
gallant
frigate
the
neversink
oh
barber
barber
it
stabs
me
to
the
not
of
hauling
down
your
ensigns
and
standards
when
is
barber
to
striking
the
flag
that
nature
herself
has
nailed
to
the
mast
here
noble
feelings
overcame
him
he
dropped
from
the
animated
attitude
into
which
his
enthusiasm
had
momentarily
transported
him
his
proud
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
and
his
long
sad
beard
almost
grazed
the
deck
trail
your
beards
in
grief
and
dishonour
oh
crew
of
the
neversink
sighed
jack
come
tell
me
my
friend
have
you
obtained
absolution
for
this
deed
you
are
about
to
commit
you
have
not
then
barber
i
will
absolve
you
your
hands
shall
be
washed
of
this
sin
it
is
not
you
but
another
and
though
you
are
about
to
shear
off
my
manhood
yet
barber
i
freely
forgive
you
kneel
kneel
barber
that
i
may
bless
you
in
token
that
i
cherish
no
malice
so
when
this
barber
who
was
the
only
one
of
his
tribe
had
kneeled
been
absolved
and
then
blessed
jack
gave
up
his
beard
into
his
hands
and
the
barber
clipping
it
off
with
a
sigh
held
it
high
aloft
and
parodying
the
style
of
the
mates
cried
aloud
hear
fore
and
aft
this
is
the
beard
of
our
matchless
jack
chase
the
noble
captain
of
this
chapter
lxxxvi
the
rebels
brought
to
the
mast
though
many
heads
of
hair
were
shorn
and
many
fine
beards
reaped
that
day
yet
several
still
held
out
and
vowed
to
defend
their
sacred
hair
to
the
last
gasp
of
their
breath
these
were
chiefly
old
of
them
petty
presuming
upon
their
age
or
rank
doubtless
thought
that
after
so
many
had
complied
with
the
commands
being
but
a
handful
would
be
exempted
from
compliance
and
remain
a
monument
of
our
clemency
that
same
evening
when
the
drum
beat
to
quarters
the
sailors
went
sullenly
to
their
guns
and
the
old
tars
who
still
sported
their
beards
stood
up
grim
defying
and
motionless
as
the
rows
of
sculptured
assyrian
kings
who
with
their
magnificent
beards
have
recently
been
exhumed
by
layard
when
the
proper
time
arrived
their
names
were
taken
down
by
the
officers
of
divisions
and
they
were
afterward
summoned
in
a
body
to
the
mast
where
the
captain
stood
ready
to
receive
them
the
whole
company
crowded
to
the
spot
and
amid
the
breathless
multitude
the
venerable
rebels
advanced
and
unhatted
it
was
an
imposing
display
they
were
old
and
venerable
mariners
their
cheeks
had
been
burned
brown
in
all
latitudes
wherever
the
sun
sends
a
tropical
ray
reverend
old
tars
one
and
all
some
of
them
might
have
been
grandsires
with
grandchildren
in
every
port
round
the
world
they
ought
to
have
commanded
the
veneration
of
the
most
frivolous
or
magisterial
beholder
even
captain
claret
they
ought
to
have
humiliated
into
deference
but
a
scythian
is
touched
with
no
reverential
promptings
and
as
the
roman
student
well
knows
the
august
senators
themselves
seated
in
the
on
the
majestic
hill
of
the
capitol
had
their
holy
beards
tweaked
by
the
insolent
chief
of
the
goths

an
array
of
beards

peaked
round
hemispherical
and
forked

chief
among
them

was
old
the
ancient
captain
of

gothic
venerableness

fell
upon
his
breast
like
a
continual
storm
ah
old
ushant
nestor
of
the
crew
it
promoted
my
longevity
to
behold
you
he
was
a
of
the
old
benbow
school
he
wore
a
short
cue
which
the
wags
of
the
called
his
of
about
his
waist
was
a
broad
belt
which
he
wore
he
said
to
brace
his
meaning
his
backbone
for
at
times
he
complained
of
rheumatic
twinges
in
the
spine
consequent
upon
sleeping
on
deck

then
during
the
of
upward
of
half
a
century

was
an
sort
of
its

carved
all
over
with

it
was
attached
to
his
neck
by
a
elaborately
worked
into
and
by
his
own
venerable
fingers
of
all
the
crew
this
ushant
was
most
beloved
by
my
glorious
captain

one
day
pointed
him
out

me

their

obedience
to
orders
they
then
paraded
themselves
at
the
mast
and
addressing
the
captain
said
our

cast
off
nor
is
it
unworthy
of
being
chronicled
that
not

sailor
who
complied
with

order
but
refused
to

prescribed
by

cried

on

escorted
along

up

the

stood
firm
as
before

must
have
guarded
the
old
man
thus
to
prevent
his
escape
to

shore
something
less
than
a

miles
distant
at

while
these
executioners
were
employed
the
excitement
had
a
little
time
to
abate
and
when
at

old
ushant
was
tied
up
by
the
arms
and
legs
and
his
venerable
back
was
back
which
had
bowed
at

the
captain
now

and
cut

hoarsely
whispered
an
old
a
of
when
the
advanced
with

waved
him
off
with
the

who
would
dishonour
you
only
dishonours
says
he

the

says
that
tarry
old
philosopher
with
the
smoking
back
tell
it
to
me
sir
if
you
dare

take
that
man
back
to
the

you
have
been
captain
of
the
forecastle
i
break
you
and
now
you
go
into
the
brig
there
to
remain
till
you
consent
to
have
that
beard
taken
beard
is
my
own
said
the
old
man
quietly
i
am
and
back
he
went
into
durance
between
the
guns
but
after
lying
some
four
or
five
days
in
irons
an
order
came
to
remove
them
but
he
was
still
kept
confined
books
were
allowed
him
and
he
spent
much
time
in
reading
but
he
also
spent
many
hours
in
braiding
his
beard
and
interweaving
with
it
strips
of
red
bunting
as
if
he
desired
to
dress
out
and
adorn
the
thing
which
had
triumphed
over
all
opposition
he
remained
a
prisoner
till
we
arrived
in
america
but
the
very
moment
he
heard
the
chain
rattle
out
of
the
and
the
ship
swing
to
her
anchor
he
started
to
his
feet
dashed
the
sentry
aside
and
gaining
the
deck
exclaimed
home
with
my
beard
his
term
of
service
having
some
months
previous
expired
and
the
ship
being
now
in
harbour
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
naval
law
and
the
officers
durst
not
molest
him
but
without
unduly
availing
himself
of
these
circumstances
the
old
man
merely
got
his
bag
and
hammock
together
hired
a
boat
and
throwing
himself
into
the
stern
was
rowed
ashore
amid
the
unsuppressible
cheers
of
all
hands
it
was
a
glorious
conquest
over
the
conqueror
himself
as
well
worthy
to
be
celebrated
as
the
battle
of
the
nile
though
as
i
afterward
learned
ushant
was
earnestly
entreated
to
put
the
case
into
some
hands
he
firmly
declined
saying
have
won
the
battle
my
friends
and
i
do
not
care
for
the
but
even
had
he
complied
with
these
entreaties
from
precedents
in
similar
cases
it
is
almost
certain
that
not
a
worth
of
satisfaction
would
have
been
received
i
know
not
in
what
frigate
you
sail
now
old
ushant
but
heaven
protect
your
storied
old
beard
in
whatever
typhoon
it
may
blow
and
if
ever
it
must
be
shorn
old
man
may
it
fare
like
the
royal
beard
of
henry
of
england
and
be
clipped
by
the
right
reverend
hand
of
some
archbishop
of
sees
as
for
captain
claret
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
it
is
here
sought
to
impale
him
before
the
world
as
a
cruel
man
such
he
was
not
nor
was
he
upon
the
whole
regarded
by
his
crew
with
anything
like
the
feelings
which
sometimes
cherish
toward
signally
tyrannical
commanders
in
truth
the
majority
of
the
previous
cruises
habituated
to
flagrant
captain
claret
a
lenient
officer
in
many
things
he
certainly
refrained
from
oppressing
them
it
has
been
related
what
privileges
he
accorded
to
the
seamen
respecting
the
free
playing
of
thing
almost
unheard
of
in
most
american
in
the
matter
of
overseeing
the
clothing
also
he
was
remarkably
indulgent
compared
with
the
conduct
of
other
navy
captains
who
by
sumptuary
regulations
oblige
their
sailors
to
run
up
large
bills
with
the
purser
for
clothes
in
a
word
of
whatever
acts
captain
claret
might
have
been
guilty
in
the
neversink
perhaps
none
of
them
proceeded
from
any
personal
organic
what
he
was
the
usages
of
the
navy
had
made
him
had
he
been
a
mere
merchant
would
no
doubt
have
been
considered
a
man
there
may
be
some
who
shall
read
of
this
bartholomew
massacre
of
beards
who
will
yet
marvel
perhaps
that
the
loss
of
a
few
hairs
more
or
less
should
provoke
such
hostility
from
the
sailors
lash
them
into
so
frothing
a
rage
indeed
come
near
breeding
a
mutiny
but
these
circumstances
are
not
without
precedent
not
to
speak
of
the
riots
attended
with
the
loss
of
life
which
once
occurred
in
madrid
in
resistance
to
an
arbitrary
edict
of
the
seeking
to
suppress
the
cloaks
of
the
cavaliers
and
not
to
make
mention
of
other
instances
that
might
be
quoted
it
needs
only
to
point
out
the
rage
of
the
saxons
in
the
time
of
william
the
conqueror
when
that
despot
commanded
the
hair
on
their
upper
lips
to
be
shaven
hereditary
mustaches
which
whole
generations
had
sported
the
multitude
of
the
dispirited
vanquished
were
obliged
to
acquiesce
but
many
saxon
franklins
and
gentlemen
of
spirit
choosing
rather
to
lose
their
castles
than
their
mustaches
voluntarily
deserted
their
firesides
and
went
into
exile
all
this
is
indignantly
related
by
the
stout
saxon
friar
matthew
paris
in
his
beginning
with
the
norman
conquest
and
that
our
were
right
in
desiring
to
perpetuate
their
beards
as
martial
appurtenances
must
seem
very
plain
when
it
is
considered
that
as
the
beard
is
the
token
of
manhood
so
in
some
shape
or
other
has
it
ever
been
held
the
true
badge
of
a
warrior
grenadiers
were
stout
whiskerandoes
and
perhaps
in
a
charge
those
fierce
whiskers
of
theirs
did
as
much
to
appall
the
foe
as
the
sheen
of
their
bayonets
most
all
fighting
creatures
sport
either
whiskers
or
beards
it
seems
a
law
of
dame
nature
witness
the
boar
the
tiger
the
cougar
man
the
leopard
the
ram
the
warriors
and
all
whiskerandoes

tribes

flogging
through
the
fleet
the
flogging
of
an
old
man
like
ushant
most
landsmen
will
probably
regard
with
abhorrence
but
though
from
peculiar
circumstances
his
case
occasioned
a
good
deal
of
indignation
among
the
people
of
the
neversink
yet
upon
its
own
proper
grounds
they
did
not
denounce
it
are
so
habituated
to
what
landsmen
would
deem
excessive
cruelties
that
they
are
almost
reconciled
to
inferior
severities
and
here
though
the
subject
of
punishment
in
the
navy
has
been
canvassed
in
previous
chapters
and
though
the
thing
is
every
way
a
most
unpleasant
and
grievous
one
to
enlarge
upon
and
though
i
painfully
nerve
myself
to
it
while
i
write
a
feeling
of
duty
compels
me
to
enter
upon
a
branch
of
the
subject
till
now
undiscussed
i
would
not
be
like
the
man
who
seeing
an
outcast
perishing
by
the
roadside
turned
about
to
his
friend
saying
us
cross
the
way
my
soul
so
sickens
at
this
sight
that
i
can
not
endure
there
are
certain
enormities
in
this
world
that
often
secure
impunity
by
their
very
excessiveness
some
ignorant
people
will
refrain
from
permanently
removing
the
cause
of
a
deadly
malaria
for
fear
of
the
temporary
spread
of
its
offensiveness
let
us
not
be
of
such
the
more
repugnant
and
repelling
the
greater
the
evil
leaving
our
women
and
children
behind
let
us
freely
enter
this
golgotha
years
ago
there
was
a
punishment
inflicted
in
the
english
and
i
believe
in
the
american
navy
called
phrase
still
employed
by
when
they
would
express
some
signal
vengeance
upon
a
personal
foe
the
practice
still
remains
in
the
french
national
marine
though
it
is
by
no
means
resorted
to
so
frequently
as
in
times
past
it
consists
of
attaching
tackles
to
the
two
extremities
of
the
and
passing
the
rope
under
the
bottom
to
one
end
of
this
rope
the
culprit
is
secured
his
own
shipmates
are
then
made
to
run
him
up
and
down
first
on
this
side
then
on
scraping
the
hull
under
hoisted
stunned
and
breathless
into
the
air
but
though
this
barbarity
is
now
abolished
from
the
english
and
american
navies
there
still
remains
another
practice
which
if
anything
is
even
worse
than
this
remnant
of
the
middle
ages
is
known
in
the
navy
as
through
the
it
is
never
inflicted
except
by
authority
of
a
upon
some
trespasser
deemed
guilty
of
a
flagrant
offence
never
that
i
know
of
has
it
been
inflicted
by
an
american
on
the
home
station
the
reason
probably
is
that
the
officers
well
know
that
such
a
spectacle
would
raise
a
mob
in
any
american
seaport
by
xli
of
the
articles
of
war
a
shall
not
any
one
offence
not
capital
inflict
a
punishment
beyond
one
hundred
lashes
in
cases
this
law
may
be
and
has
been
quoted
in
judicial
justification
of
the
infliction
of
more
than
one
hundred
lashes
indeed
it
would
cover
a
thousand
thus
one
act
of
a
sailor
may
be
construed
into
the
commission
of
ten
different
transgressions
for
each
of
which
he
may
be
legally
condemned
to
a
hundred
lashes
to
be
inflicted
without
intermission
it
will
be
perceived
that
in
any
case
deemed
a
sailor
under
the
above
article
may
legally
be
flogged
to
the
death
but
neither
by
the
articles
of
war
nor
by
any
other
enactment
of
congress
is
there
any
direct
warrant
for
the
extraordinary
cruelty
of
the
mode
in
which
punishment
is
inflicted
in
cases
of
flogging
through
the
fleet
but
as
in
numerous
other
instances
the
incidental
aggravations
of
this
penalty
are
indirectly
covered
by
other
clauses
in
the
articles
of
war
one
of
which
authorises
the
authorities
of
a
certain
indefinite
correct
the
guilty
to
the
usages
of
the
one
of
these
is
the
following
all
hands
being
called
witness
in
the
ship
to
which
the
culprit
belongs
the
sentence
of
the
condemning
him
is
read
when
with
the
usual
solemnities
a
portion
of
the
punishment
is
inflicted
in
order
that
it
shall
not
lose
in
severity
by
the
slightest
exhaustion
in
the
arm
of
the
executioner
a
fresh
mate
is
called
out
at
every
dozen
as
the
leading
idea
is
to
strike
terror
into
the
beholders
the
greatest
number
of
lashes
is
inflicted
on
board
the
own
ship
in
order
to
render
him
the
more
shocking
spectacle
to
the
crews
of
the
other
vessels
the
first
infliction
being
concluded
the
shirt
is
thrown
over
him
he
is
put
into
a
march
being
played
rowed
to
the
next
ship
of
the
squadron
all
hands
of
that
ship
are
then
called
to
man
the
rigging
and
another
portion
of
the
punishment
is
inflicted
by
the
mates
of
that
ship
the
bloody
shirt
is
again
thrown
over
the
seaman
and
thus
he
is
carried
through
the
fleet
or
squadron
till
the
whole
sentence
is
inflicted
in
other
cases
the
largest
of
the
rigged
with
a
platform
like
a
scaffold
upon
which
halberds
something
like
those
used
in
the
english
army
are
erected

consist
of
two
stout
poles
planted
upright
upon
the
platform
stand
a
lieutenant
a
surgeon
a
and
the
executioners
with
their
they
are
rowed
through
the
fleet
stopping
at
each
ship
till
the
whole
sentence
is
inflicted
as
before
in
some
cases
the
attending
surgeon
has
professionally
interfered
before
the
last
lash
has
been
given
alleging
that
immediate
death
must
ensue
if
the
remainder
should
be
administered
without
a
respite
but
instead
of
humanely
remitting
the
remaining
lashes
in
a
case
like
this
the
man
is
generally
consigned
to
his
cot
for
ten
or
twelve
days
and
when
the
surgeon
officially
reports
him
capable
of
undergoing
the
rest
of
the
sentence
it
is
forthwith
inflicted
shylock
must
have
his
pound
of
flesh
to
say
that
after
being
flogged
through
the
fleet
the
back
is
sometimes
puffed
up
like
a
pillow
or
to
say
that
in
other
cases
it
looks
as
if
burned
black
before
a
roasting
fire
or
to
say
that
you
may
track
him
through
the
squadron
by
the
blood
on
the
bulwarks
of
every
ship
would
only
be
saying
what
many
seamen
have
seen
several
weeks
sometimes
whole
months
elapse
before
the
sailor
is
sufficiently
recovered
to
resume
his
duties
during
the
greater
part
of
that
interval
he
lies
in
the
groaning
out
his
days
and
nights
and
unless
he
has
the
hide
and
constitution
of
a
rhinoceros
he
never
is
the
man
he
was
before
but
broken
and
shattered
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
sinks
into
death
before
his
time
instances
have
occurred
where
he
has
expired
the
day
after
the
punishment
no
wonder
that
the
englishman
once
a
surgeon
in
the
in
his
work
on
russia
that
the
barbarian
itself
is
not
a
greater
torture
to
undergo
than
the
navy
some
years
ago
a
fire
broke
out
near
the
powder
magazine
in
an
american
national
ship
one
of
the
squadron
at
anchor
in
the
bay
of

the
utmost
alarm
prevailed
a
cry
went
fore
and
aft
that
the
ship
was
about
to
blow
up
one
of
the
seamen
sprang
overboard
in
affright
at
length
the
fire
was
got
under
and
the
man
was
picked
up
he
was
tried
before
a
found
guilty
of
cowardice
and
condemned
to
be
flogged
through

fleet
in
due
time
the
squadron
made
sail
for

and
in

punishment

all

in

was
something
less
than

were
officered
by
a

two

the
custom
generally
is
to
have
a
marine
to
each
gun
which
rule
usually
furnishes
the
scale
for
distributing
the
soldiers
in
vessels
of
different
force
our
marines
had
no
other
than
martial
duty
to
perform
excepting
that
at
sea
they
stood
watches
like
the
sailors
and
now
and
then
lazily
assisted
in
pulling
the
ropes
but
they
never
put
foot
in
rigging

on
the
these
men
were
stationed
at
none
of
the
great
guns

they

what
then
were
they
for
to
serve
their
country
in
time
of

let
us
see
when
a
ship
is
running
into
action
her
marines
generally
lie
flat
on
their
faces
behind
the
bulwarks
the
sailors
are
sometimes
ordered
to
do
the
same
and
when
the
vessel
is
fairly
engaged
they
are
usually
drawn
up
in
the
a
company
reviewing
in
the
park
at
close
quarters
their
muskets
may
pick
off
a
seaman
or
two
in
the
rigging
but
at
distance
they
must
passively
stand
in
their
ranks
and
be
decimated
at
the
leisure
only
in
one
case
in
is
when
their
vessel
is
attempted
to
be
boarded
by
a
large
party
are
these
marines
of
any
essential
service
as
fighting
men
with
their
bayonets
they
are
then
called
upon
to
if
comparatively
so
useless
as
soldiers
why
have
marines
at
all
in
the
navy
know
then
that
what
standing
armies
are
to
nations
what
turnkeys
are
to
jails
these
marines
are
to
the
seamen
in
all
large
their
muskets
are
their
keys
with
those
muskets
they
stand
guard
over

surely
the

who
besides
having
so
many
over
them
are
thus
additionally
guarded
by
soldiers
even
when
they
quench
their
these
must
be
desperadoes
indeed
or
else
the
naval
service
must
be
so
tyrannical
that
the
worst
is
feared
from
their
possible
insubordination
either
reason
holds
good
or
both
according
to
the
character
of
the
officers
and
crew
it
must
be
evident
that
the
casts

an
evil
eye
on
a

to
call
a

is
among
seamen
one
of
the
greatest
terms
of
contempt
but
the
mutual
contempt
and
even
hatred
subsisting
between
these
two
bodies
of
clinging
to
one
keel
both
lodged
in
one
held
by
most
navy
officers
as
the
height
of
the
perfection
of
navy
discipline
it
is
regarded
as
the
button
that
caps
the
uttermost
point
on
their
thus
they
reason
secure
of
this
antagonism
between
the
marine
and
the
sailor
we
can
always
rely
upon
it
that
if
the
sailor
mutinies
it
needs
no
great
incitement
for
the
marine
to
thrust
his
bayonet
through
his
heart
if
the
marine
revolts
the
pike
of
the
sailor
is
impatient
to
charge
checks
and
balances
blood
against
blood
is
the
cry
and
the
argument
what
applies
to
the
relation
in
which
the
marine
and
sailor
stand
toward
each
mutual
repulsion
implied
by
a
system
of
in
degree
apply
to
nearly
the
entire
interior
of
a
discipline
the
whole
body
of
this
discipline
is
emphatically
a
system
of
cruel
cogs
and
wheels
systematically
grinding
up
in
one
common
hopper
all
that
might
minister
to
the
moral
of
the
crew
it
is
the
same
with
both
officers
and
men
if
a
captain
have
a
grudge
against
a
lieutenant
or
a
lieutenant
against
a
midshipman
how
easy
to
torture
him
by
official
treatment
which
shall
not
lay
open
the
superior
officer
to
legal
rebuke
and
if
a
midshipman
bears
a
grudge
against
a
sailor
how
easy
for
him
by
cunning
practices
born
of
a
boyish
spite
to
have
him
degraded
at
the
gangway
through
all
the
endless
ramifications
of
rank
and
station
in
most
there
runs
a
sinister
vein
of
bitterness
not
exceeded
by
the
fireside
hatreds
in
a
family
of
stepsons
ashore
it
were
sickening
to
detail
all
the
paltry
irritabilities
jealousies
and
cabals
the
spiteful
detractions
and
animosities
that
lurk
far
down
and
cling
to
the
very
kelson
of
the
ship
it
is
unmanning
to
think
of
the
immutable
ceremonies
and
iron
etiquette
of
a
the
spiked
barriers
separating
the
various
grades
of
rank
the
delegated
absolutism
of
authority
on
all
hands
the
impossibility
on
the
part
of
the
common
seaman
of
appeal
from
incidental
abuses
and
many
more
things
that
might
be
enumerated
all
tend
to
beget
in
most
armed
ships
a
general
social
condition
which
is
the
precise
reverse
of
what
any
christian
could
desire
and
though
there
are
vessels
that
in
some
measure
furnish
exceptions
to
this
and
though
in
other
ships
the
thing
may
be
glazed
over
by
a
guarded
punctilious
exterior
almost
completely
hiding
the
truth
from
casual
visitors
while
the
worst
facts
touching
the
common
sailor
are
systematically
kept
in
the
background
yet
it
is
certain
that
what
has
here
been
said
of
the
domestic
interior
of
a
will
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
apply
to
most
vessels
in
the
navy
it
is
not
that
the
officers
are
so
malevolent
nor
altogether
that
the
is
so
vicious
some
of
these
evils
are
unavoidably
generated
through
the
operation
of
the
naval
code
others
are
absolutely
organic
to
a
navy
establishment
and
like
other
organic
evils
are
incurable
except
when
they
dissolve
with
the
body
they
live
in
chapter
xc
the
manning
of
navies
gallows
and
the
sea
refuse
nothing
is
a
very
old
sea
saying
and
among
all
the
wondrous
prints
of
hogarth
there
is
none
remaining
more
true
at
the
present
day
than
that
dramatic
where
after
consorting
with
harlots
and
gambling
on
the
idle
apprentice
with
the
villainous
low
forehead
is
at
last
represented
as
being
pushed
off
to
sea
with
a
ship
and
a
gallows
in
the
distance
but
hogarth
should
have
converted
the
masts
themselves
into
and
thus
with
the
ocean
for
a
background
closed
the
career
of
his
hero
it
would
then
have
had
all
the
dramatic
force
of
the
opera
of
don
juan
who
after
running
his
impious
courses
is
swept
from
our
sight
in
a
tornado
of
devils
for
the
sea
is
the
true
tophet
and
bottomless
pit
of
many
workers
of
iniquity
and
as
the
german
mystics
feign
gehennas
within
gehennas
even
so
are
familiarly
known
among
sailors
as
and
as
the
sea
according
to
old
fuller
is
the
stable
of
brute
monsters
gliding
hither
and
thither
in
unspeakable
swarms
even
so
is
it
the
home
of
many
moral
monsters
who
fitly
divide
its
empire
with
the
snake
the
shark
and
the
worm
nor
are
sailors
and
especially
at
all
blind
to
a
true
sense
of
these
things
rigged
and
parish
is
the
sailor
saying
in
the
american
navy
when
the
tyro
first
mounts
the
lined
frock
and
blue
jacket
aptly
manufactured
for
him
in
a
state
prison
ashore
no
wonder
that
lured
by
some
into
a
service
so
galling
and
perhaps
persecuted
by
a
vindictive
lieutenant
some
repentant
sailors
have
actually
jumped
into
the
sea
to
escape
from
their
fate
or
set
themselves
adrift
on
the
wide
ocean
on
the
gratings
without
compass
or
rudder
in
one
case
a
young
man
after
being
nearly
cut
into
meat
at
the
gangway
loaded
his
pockets
with
shot
and
walked
overboard
some
years
ago
i
was
in
a
whaling
ship
lying
in
a
harbour
of
the
pacific
with
three
french
alongside
one
dark
moody
night
a
suppressed
cry
was
heard
from
the
face
of
the
waters
and
thinking
it
was
some
one
drowning
a
boat
was
lowered
when
two
french
sailors
were
picked
up
half
dead
from
exhaustion
and
nearly
throttled
by
a
bundle
of
their
clothes
tied
fast
to
their
shoulders
in
this
manner
they
had
attempted
their
escape
from
their
vessel
when
the
french
officers
came
in
pursuit
these
sailors
rallying
from
their
exhaustion
fought
like
tigers
to
resist
being
captured
though
this
story
concerns
a
french
armed
ship
it
is
not
the
less
applicable
in
degree
to
those
of
other
nations
mix
with
the
men
in
an
american
armed
ship
mark
how
many
foreigners
there
are
though
it
is
against
the
law
to
enlist
them
nearly
one
third
of
the
petty
officers
of
the
neversink
were
born
east
of
the
atlantic
why
is
this
because
the
same
principle
that
operates
in
hindering
americans
from
hiring
themselves
out
as
menial
domestics
also
restrains
them
in
a
great
measure
from
voluntarily
assuming
a
far
worse
servitude
in
the
navy
wanted
for
the
is
a
common
announcement
along
the
wharves
of
our
they
are
always
it
may
have
been
in
part
owing
to
this
scarcity
men
that
not
many
years
ago
black
slaves
were
frequently
to
be
found
regularly
enlisted
with
the
crew
of
an
american
frigate
their
masters
receiving
their
pay
this
was
in
the
teeth
of
a
law
of
congress
expressly
prohibiting
slaves
in
the
navy
this
law
indirectly
means
black
slaves
nothing
being
said
concerning
white
ones
but
in
view
of
what
john
randolph
of
roanoke
said
about
the
frigate
that
carried
him
to
russia
and
in
view
of
what
most
armed
vessels
actually
are
at
present
the
american
navy
is
not
altogether
an
inappropriate
place
for
hereditary
bondmen
still
the
circumstance
of
their
being
found
in
it
is
of
such
a
nature
that
to
some
it
may
hardly
appear
credible
the
incredulity
of
such
persons
nevertheless
must
yield
to
the
fact
that
on
board
of
the
united
states
ship
neversink
during
the
present
cruise
there
was
a
virginian
slave
regularly
shipped
as
a
seaman
his
owner
receiving
his
wages
was
his
name
among
the
to
the
purser
who
was
a
southern
gentleman
he
was
employed
as
his
body
servant
never
did
i
feel
my
condition
as
a
so
keenly
as
when
seeing
this
guinea
freely
circulating
about
the
decks
in
clothes
and
through
the
influence
of
his
master
almost
entirely
exempted
from
the
disciplinary
degradation
of
the
caucasian
crew
faring
sumptuously
in
the
sleek
and
round
his
ebon
face
fairly
polished
with
content
ever
gay
and
hilarious
ever
ready
to
laugh
and
joke
that
african
slave
was
actually
envied
by
many
of
the
seamen
there
were
times
when
i
almost
envied
him
myself
lemsford
once
envied
him
outright
guinea
he
sighed
have
peaceful
times
you
never
opened
the
book
i
read
one
morning
when
all
hands
were
called
to
witness
punishment
the
slave
as
usual
was
observed
to
be
hurrying
down
the
ladders
toward
the
his
face
wearing
that
peculiar
pinched
blueness
which
in
the
negro
answers
to
the
paleness
caused
by
nervous
agitation
in
the
white
are
you
going
guinea
cried
the
a
humorous
gentleman
who
sometimes
diverted
himself
with
the
slave
and
well
knew
what
answer
he
would
now
receive
from
him
are
you
going
guinea
said
this
officer
about
you
hear
the
call
sir
me
massa
said
the
slave
with
a
low
salutation
it
i
indeed
massa
and
so
saying
he
disappeared
beyond
the
hatchway
he
was
the
only
person
on
board
except
the
and
the
invalids
of
the
who
was
exempted
from
being
present
at
the
administering
of
the
scourge
accustomed
to
light
and
easy
duties
from
his
birth
and
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
with
none
but
gentle
masters
guinea
though
a
bondman
liable
to
be
saddled
with
a
mortgage
like
a
in
manacles
enjoyed
the
liberties
of
the
world
though
his
proprietor
the
purser
never
in
any
way
individualised
me
while
i
served
on
board
the
frigate
and
never
did
me
a
good
office
of
any
kind
it
was
hardly
in
his
power
yet
from
his
pleasant
kind
indulgent
manner
toward
his
slave
i
always
imputed
to
him
a
generous
heart
and
cherished
an
involuntary
friendliness
toward
him
upon
our
arrival
home
his
treatment
of
guinea
under
circumstances
peculiarly
calculated
to
stir
up
the
resentment
of
a
still
more
augmented
my
estimation
of
the
good
heart
mention
has
been
made
of
the
number
of
foreigners
in
the
american
navy
but
it
is
not
in
the
american
navy
alone
that
foreigners
bear
so
large
a
proportion
to
the
rest
of
the
crew
though
in
no
navy
perhaps
have
they
ever
borne
so
large
a
proportion
as
in
our
own
according
to
an
english
estimate
the
foreigners
serving
in
the
ships
at
one
time
amounted
to
one
eighth
of
the
entire
body
of
seamen
how
it
is
in
the
french
navy
i
can
not
with
certainty
say
but
i
have
repeatedly
sailed
with
english
seamen
who
have
served
in
it
one
of
the
effects
of
the
free
introduction
of
foreigners
into
any
navy
can
not
be
sufficiently
deplored
during
the
period
i
lived
in
the
neversink
i
was
repeatedly
struck
by
the
lack
of
patriotism
in
many
of
my
shipmates
true
they
were
mostly
foreigners
who
unblushingly
avowed
that
were
it
not
for
the
difference
of
pay
they
would
as
lief
man
the
guns
of
an
english
ship
as
those
of
an
american
or
frenchman
nevertheless
it
was
evident
that
as
for
any
patriotic
feeling
there
was
comparatively
very
any
of
by
our
sailors
as
a
body
upon
reflection
this
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
from
their
roving
career
and
the
sundering
of
all
domestic
ties
many
sailors
all
the
world
over
are
like
the
companions
who
some
centuries
ago
wandered
over
europe
ready
to
fight
the
battles
of
any
prince
who
could
purchase
their
swords
the
only
patriotism
is
born
and
nurtured
in
a
stationary
home
and
upon
an
immovable
but
the
though
in
his
voyagings
he
weds
the
two
poles
and
brings
both
indies
together
yet
let
him
wander
where
he
will
he
carries
his
one
only
home
along
with
him
that
home
is
his
hammock
under
a
gun
and
educated
on
the
according
to
a
phrase
of
his
own
the
rolls
round
the
world
like
a
billow
ready
to
mix
with
any
sea
or
be
sucked
down
to
death
in
the
maelstrom
of
any
war
yet
more
the
dread
of
the
general
discipline
of
a
the
special
obnoxiousness
of
the
gangway
the
protracted
confinement
on
board
ship
with
so
few
days
and
the
pittance
of
pay
much
less
than
what
can
always
be
had
in
the
merchant
service
these
things
contrive
to
deter
from
the
navies
of
all
countries
by
far
the
majority
of
their
best
seamen
this
will
be
obvious
when
the
following
statistical
facts
taken
from
annals
of
commerce
are
considered
at
one
period
upon
the
peace
establishment
the
number
of
men
employed
in
the
english
navy
was
at
the
same
time
the
english
merchant
service
was
employing
but
while
the
necessities
of
a
merchantman
render
it
indispensable
that
the
greater
part
of
her
crew
be
able
seamen
the
circumstances
of
a
admit
of
her
mustering
a
crowd
of
landsmen
soldiers
and
boys
in
her
service
by
a
statement
of
captain
in
his
pamphlet
the
abolition
of
impressment
it
appears
that
at
the
close
of
the
bonaparte
wars
a
full
third
of
all
the
crews
of
his
fleets
consisted
of
landsmen
and
boys
far
from
entering
with
enthusiasm
into
the
ships
when
their
country
were
menaced
the
great
body
of
english
seamen
appalled
at
the
discipline
of
the
navy
adopted
devices
to
escape
its
some
even
hid
themselves
in
caves
and
lonely
places
inland
fearing
to
run
the
risk
of
seeking
a
berth
in
an
merchantman
that
might
have
carried
them
beyond
sea
in
the
true
narrative
of
nichol
mariner
published
in
by
blackwood
in
edinburgh
and
cadell
in
london
and
which
everywhere
bears
the
spontaneous
impress
of
truth
the
old
sailor
in
the
most
artless
touching
and
almost
uncomplaining
manner
tells
of
his
like
a
for
whole
years
in
the
country
round
about
edinburgh
to
avoid
the
prowling
through
the
land
like
bandits
and
burkers
at
this
time
wars
according
to
list
there
were
regular
stations
in
great
britain
besides
this
domestic
kidnapping
british
frigates
in
friendly
or
neutral
harbours
in
some
instances
pressed
into
their
service
foreign
sailors
of
all
nations
from
the
public
wharves
in
certain
cases
where
americans
were
concerned
when
were
found
upon
their
persons
these
were
destroyed
and
to
prevent
the
american
consul
from
claiming
his
sailor
countrymen
the
generally
went
on
shore
the
night
previous
to
the
sailing
of
the
frigate
so
that
the
kidnapped
seamen
were
far
out
to
sea
before
they
could
be
missed
by
their
friends
these
things
should
be
known
for
in
case
the
english
government
again
goes
to
war
with
its
fleets
and
should
again
resort
to
indiscriminate
impressment
to
man
them
it
is
well
that
both
englishmen
and
americans
that
all
the
world
be
prepared
to
put
down
an
iniquity
outrageous
and
insulting
to
god
and
man
in
a
later
instance
a
large
body
of
british
seamen
solemnly
assembled
upon
the
eve
of
an
anticipated
war
and
together
determined
that
in
case
of
its
breaking
out
they
would
at
once
flee
to
america
to
avoid
being
pressed
into
the
service
of
their
service
which
degraded
her
own
guardians
at
the
gangway
at
another
time
long
previous
to
this
according
to
an
english
navy
officer
lieutenant
tomlinson
three
thousand
seamen
impelled
by
the
same
motive
fled
ashore
in
a
panic
from
the
colliers
between
yarmouth
roads
and
the
nore
elsewhere
he
says
in
speaking
of
some
of
the
men
on
board
the
ships
that
were
most
miserable
this
remark
is
perfectly
corroborated
by
other
testimony
referring
to
another
period
in
alluding
to
the
lamented
scarcity
of
good
english
seamen
during
the
wars
of
the
author
of
a
pamphlet
on
says
that
all
the
best
seamen
the
steadiest
and
men
generally
succeeded
in
avoiding
the
impress
this
writer
was
or
had
been
himself
a
captain
in
the
british
fleet
now
it
may
be
easily
imagined
who
are
the
men
and
of
what
moral
character
they
are
who
even
at
the
present
day
are
willing
to
enlist
as
adults
in
a
service
so
galling
to
all
as
the
navy
hence
it
comes
that
the
skulkers
and
scoundrels
of
all
sorts
in
a
are
chiefly
composed
not
of
regular
seamen
but
of
these
of
landsmen
men
who
enter
the
navy
to
draw
their
grog
and
murder
their
time
in
the
notorious
idleness
of
a
frigate
but
if
so
idle
why
not
reduce
the
number
of

the

of

a
large
number
of
hands
to
brace
the
heavy

hoist
the
enormous

weigh
the
ponderous
anchor
and
though
the

the

of

many

comes

seldom
it

when
that

it

at
any
multitude
of

besides
this

to
crown
all
the

there
must
be

full
of

i
do
not
unite
with
a
high
critical
authority
in
considering
ditties
as
songs
for
most
of
them
breathe
the
very
poetry
of
the
ocean
but
it
is
remarkable
that
those
would
lead
one
to
think
that
are
the
most
contented
virtuous
and
patriotic
of
composed
at
a
time
when
the
english
navy
was
principally
manned
by
felons
and
paupers
as
mentioned
in
a
former

still
more
these

are
pervaded
by
a
true
mohammedan
sensualism
a
reckless
acquiescence
in
fate
and
an
implicit
unquestioning
devotion
to
whoever
may
be

master
dibdin

no

notwithstanding
the
iniquities
of

men
are
to
be
found
in
them
at
times
so
used
to
a
hard
life
so
drilled
and
disciplined
to
servitude
that
with
an
incomprehensible
philosophy
they
seem
cheerfully
to
resign
themselves
to
their
fate
they
have
plenty
to
eat

to
drink

keep
them

pray
for
them

a
penniless
castaway

not
all
this
seem
as
a
luxurious
bill
of
fare
there
was
on
board
of
the
neversink
a

the
name
of
landless

though
his
back

plaided
with
the
ineffaceable
scars
of
all
the
floggings
accumulated
by
a
reckless
tar
during
a
ten

in
the
navy

he
perpetually
wore
a
hilarious
face
and
at
joke
and
repartee
was
a
very
joe

that
man
though
a
was
not
created
in

he
enjoyed
life
with
the
zest
of
everlasting
adolescence
and
though
cribbed
in
an
oaken
prison
with
the
turnkey
sentries
all
round
him
yet
he
paced
the
as
if
it
were
broad
as
a
prairie
and
diversified
in
landscape
as
the
hills
and
valleys
of
the
tyrol
nothing
ever
disconcerted
him
nothing
could
transmute
his
laugh
into
anything
like
a
sigh
those
glandular
secretions
which
in
other
captives
sometimes
go
to
the
formation
of
tears
in

expectorated
from
the

with
the
golden
juice

merrily
playing
at

snoring

favourite
with

he
went
by

it
is
just
such
happy
jacks
as

that
most
profess
to
admire
a
fellow
without
shame
without
a
soul
so
dead
to
the
least
dignity
of
manhood
that
he
could
hardly
be
called
a
man
whereas
a
seaman
who
exhibits
traits
of
moral
sensitiveness
whose
demeanour
shows
some
dignity
within
this
is
the
man
they
in
many
cases
instinctively
dislike
the
reason
is
they
feel
such
a
man
to
be
a
continual
reproach
to
them
as
being
mentally
superior
to
their
power
he
has
no

do

is

insolence
in

carriage
he
is
unendurable
as

let
it
not

however
that
the
remarks
in

and

preceding
chapter
apply
to
there
are
some
vessels
blessed
with

captains

and

and

usages
of

tyrannical
rigour
of
the
articles
of
war
in
them
scourging

unknown
to
sail
in
such
ships
is
hardly
to
realise
that
you
live
under
the
martial
law
or
that
the
evils
above
mentioned
can
anywhere
exist
and
jack

old

and
several
more
fine
tars
that
might
be
added
sufficiently
attest
that
in
the
neversink
at

there
was
more
than
one
noble
who
almost
redeemed
all
the
rest
wherever
throughout
this
narrative
the
american
navy
in
any
of
its
bearings
has
formed
the
theme
of
a
general
discussion
hardly
one
syllable
of
admiration
for
what
is
accounted
illustrious
in
its
achievements
has
been
permitted
to
escape
me
the
reason
is
this
i
consider
that
so
far
as
what
is
called
military
renown
is
concerned
the
american
navy
needs
no
eulogist
but
history
it
were
superfluous
for
to
tell
the
world
what
it
knows
already
the
office
imposed
upon
me
is
of
another
cast
and
though
i
foresee
and
feel
that
it
may
subject
me
to
the
pillory
in
the
hard
thoughts
of
some
men
yet
supported
by
what
god
has
given

tranquilly

whatever
it
may
prove
chapter
xci
in
a
with
scenes
on
the
drawing
near
home
there
is
a
fable
about
a
painter
moved
by
jove
to
the
painting
of
the
head
of
medusa
though
the
picture
was
true
to
the
life
yet
the
poor
artist
sickened
at
the
sight
of
what
his
forced
pencil
had
drawn
thus
borne
through
my
task
toward
the
end
my
own
soul
now
sinks
at
what
i
myself
have
portrayed
but
let
us
forget
past
chapters
if
we
may
while
we
paint
less
repugnant
things

the
grand
centre
of
gossip
and
news
among
the
sailors
here
crowds
assemble
to
chat
away
the
elapsing
after
every
meal
the
reason
why
this
place
and
these
hours
are
selected
rather
than
others
is
this
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
galley
alone
and
only
after
meals
is
the
permitted
to
regale
himself
with
a
smoke
a
sumptuary
edict
truly
that
deprived
for
one
of
a
luxury
to
which
he
had
long
been
attached
for
how
can
the
mystical
motives
the
capricious
impulses
of
a
luxurious
smoker
go
and
come
at
the
beck
of
a
command
no
when
i
smoke
be
it
because
of
my
sovereign
good
pleasure
i
choose
so
to
do
though
at
so
unseasonable
an
hour
that
i
send
round
the
town
for
a
brasier
of
coals
what
smoke
by
a
smoke
on
compulsion
make
a
trade
a
business
a
vile
recurring
calling
of
smoking
and
perhaps
when
those
sedative
fumes
have
steeped
you
in
the
grandest
of
reveries
and
circle
over
circle
solemnly
rises
some
immeasurable
dome
in
your
away
swelling
and
heaving
into
the
vapour
you
if
from
one
grandest
marches
of
a
temple
were
rising
like
venus
from
the
such
a
time
to
have
your
whole
parthenon
tumbled
about
your
ears
by
the
knell
of
the
bell
announcing
the
expiration
of
the

me
in

smite
me
some
thunderbolt
charge
upon
me
endless
squadrons
of
mamalukes
devour
me
feejees
but
preserve
me
from
a
tyranny
like
this
no
though
i
smoked
like
an
indian
summer
ere
i
entered
the
neversink
so
abhorrent
was
this
sumptuary
law
that
i
altogether
abandoned
the
luxury
rather
than
enslave
it
to
a
time
and
a
place
herein
did
i
not
right
ancient
and
honourable
old
guard
of
smokers
all
round
the
world
but
there
were
others
of
the
crew
not
so
fastidious
as
myself
after
every
meal
they
hied
to
the
galley
and
solaced
their
souls
with
a
whiff
now
a
bunch
of
cigars
all
banded
together
is
a
type
and
a
symbol
of
the
brotherly
love
between
smokers
likewise
for
the
time
in
a
community
of
pipes
is
a
community
of
hearts
nor
was
it
an
ill
thing
for
the
indian
sachems
to
circulate
their
calumet
as
our
own
forefathers
circulated
their
token
of
peace
charity
and
friendly
feelings
and
sympathising
souls
and
this
it
was
that
made
the
gossipers
of
the
galley
so
loving
a
club
so
long
as
the
vapoury
bond
united
them
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
behold
them
grouped
in
the
recesses
between
the
guns
they
chatted
and
laughed
like
rows
of
convivialists
in
the
boxes
of
some
vast
take

kitchen
full
of
good
fellows
from
teniers
add
a
fireside
group
from
wilkie
throw
in
a
naval
sketch
from
cruickshank
and
then
stick
a
short
pipe
into
every
mouth
and
you
have
the
smoking
scene
at
the
galley
of
the
neversink
not
a
few
were
politicians
and
as
there
were
some
thoughts
of
a
war
with

at
the

waxed

my

put
the
yankee

these
political
discussions
by
no
means
supplied
the
staple
of
conversation
for
the
gossiping
smokers
of
the
galley
the
interior
affairs
of
the
frigate
itself
formed
their
principal
theme
rumours
about
the
private
life
of

in

cabin
about
the

about
the
various

about

the

shifting

of

inexhaustible
topics
for

the
animation
of
these
scenes
was
very
much
heightened
as
we
drew
nearer
and
nearer
our
port
it
rose
to
a
climax
when
the
frigate
was
reported
to
be
only

from
the
land
what
they
should
do
when
they
landed
how
they
should
invest
their

what
they
should
eat
what
they

what

the
topics

was
indeed
a

fact
that

to
keep

cruise
accumulated
in
one
intense
recollection
of
a
moment
with
the
smell
of
tar
in
their
nostrils
out
of
sight
of
land
with
a
stout
ship
under
foot
and
snuffing
the
ocean
air
with
all
the
things
of
the
sea
surrounding
them
in
their
cool
sober
moments
of
reflection
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
deep
during
the
long
when
all
their
holy
home
associations
were
thronging
round
their
hearts
in
the
spontaneous
piety
and
devotion
of
the
last
hours
of
so
long
a
voyage
in
the
fullness
and
the
frankness
of
their
souls
when
there
was
naught
to
jar
the
equilibrium
of
their
all
these
circumstances
at
least
nine
tenths
of
a
crew
of
five
hundred
resolved
for
ever
to
turn
their
backs
on
the
sea
but
do
men
ever
hate
the
thing
they
love
do
men
forswear
the
hearth
and
the
homestead
what
then
must
the
navy
be
but
alas
for
the
who
though
he
may
take
a
hannibal
oath
against
the
service
yet
cruise
after
cruise
and
after
forswearing
it
again
and
again
he
is
driven
back
to
the
and
the
by
his
old
hereditary
foe
the
god
of
grog
on
this
point
let
some
of
the
crew
of
the
neversink
be
called
to
the
stand
you
captain
of
the
waist
and
you
seamen
of
the
and
you
and
others
how
came
you
here
at
the
guns
of
the
north
carolina
after
registering
your
solemn
vows
at
the
galley
of
the
neversink
they
all
hang
their
heads
i
know
the
cause
poor
fellows
perjure
yourselves
not
again
swear
not
at
all
hereafter
ay
these
very
foremost
in
denouncing
the
navy
who
had
bound
themselves
by
the
most
tremendous
very
men
not
three
days
after
getting
ashore
were
rolling
round
the
streets
in
penniless
drunkenness
and
next
day
many
of
them
were
to
be
found
on
board
of
the
or
thus
in
part
is
the
navy
manned
but
what
was
still
more
surprising
and
tended
to
impart
a
new
and
strange
insight
into
the
character
of
sailors
and
overthrow
some
ideas
concerning
them
as
a
class
was
this
numbers
of
men
who
during
the
cruise
had
passed
for
exceedingly
prudent
nay
parsimonious
persons
who
would
even
refuse
you
a
patch
or
a
needleful
of
thread
and
from
their
stinginess
procured
the
name
of
sooner
were
these
men
fairly
adrift
in
harbour
and
under
the
influence
of
frequent
quaffings
than
their
wages
flew
right
and
left
they
summoned
whole
of
sailors
to
the
bar
and
treated
them
over
and
over
again
fine
fellows
tars
seeing
this
sight
i
thought
to
myself
well
these
tars
on
shore
were
the
greatest
curmudgeons
afloat
the
bottle
generous
not
they
yet
the
popular
conceit
concerning
a
sailor
is
derived
from
his
behaviour
ashore
whereas
ashore
he
is
no
longer
a
sailor
but
a
landsman
for
the
time
a
is
only
a
at
sea
and
the
sea
is
the
place
to
learn
what
he
is
but
we
have
seen
that
a
is
but
this
world
of
ours
afloat
full
of
all
manner
of
of
strange
contradictions
and
though
boasting
some
fine
fellows
here
and
there
yet
upon
the
whole
charged
to
the
combings
of
her
hatchways
with
the
spirit
of
belial
and
all
unrighteousness
chapter
xcii
the
last
of
the
jacket
already
has
chronicled
the
mishaps
and
inconveniences
troubles
and
tribulations
of
all
sorts
brought
upon
him
by
that
unfortunate
but
indispensable
garment
of
his
but
now
it
befalls
him
to
record
how
this
jacket
for
the
second
and
last
time
came
near
proving
his
shroud
of
a
pleasant
midnight
our
good
frigate
now
somewhere
off
the
capes
of
virginia
was
running
on
bravely
when
the
breeze
gradually
dying
left
us
slowly
gliding
toward
our
still
invisible
port
headed
by
jack
chase
the
were
reclining
in
the
top
talking
about
the
shore
delights
into
which
they
intended
to
plunge
while
our
captain
often
broke
in
with
allusions
to
similar
conversations
when
he
was
on
board
the
english
ship
the
asia
drawing
nigh
to
portsmouth
in
england
after
the
battle
of
navarino
suddenly
an
order
was
given
to
set
the
and
the
halyards
not
being
rove
jack
chase
assigned
to
me
that
duty
now
this
reeving
of
the
halyards
of
a
is
a
business
that
eminently
demands
sharpsightedness
skill
and
celerity
consider
that
the
end
of
a
line
some
two
hundred
feet
long
is
to
be
carried
aloft
in
your
teeth
if
you
please
and
dragged
far
out
on
the
giddiest
of
yards
and
after
being
wormed
and
twisted
about
through
all
sorts
of
abrupt
corners
at
the
abruptest
of
to
be
dropped
clear
of
all
obstructions
in
a
straight
right
down
to
the
deck
in
the
course
of
this
business
there
is
a
multitude
of
and
blocks
through
which
you
must
pass
it
often
the
rope
is
a
very
tight
fit
so
as
to
make
it
like
threading
a
fine
cambric
needle
with
rather
coarse
thread
indeed
it
is
a
thing
only
deftly
to
be
done
even
by
day
judge
then
what
it
must
be
to
be
threading
cambric
needles
by
night
and
at
sea
upward
of
a
hundred
feet
aloft
in
the
air
with
the
end
of
the
line
in
one
hand
i
was
mounting
the
shrouds
when
our
captain
of
the
top
told
me
that
i
had
better
off
jacket
but
though
it
was
not
a
very
cold
night
i
had
been
reclining
so
long
in
the
top
that
i
had
become
somewhat
chilly
so
i
thought
best
not
to
comply
with
the
hint
having
reeved
the
line
through
all
the
inferior
blocks
i
went
out
with
it
to
the
end
of
the
and
was
in
the
act
of
leaning
over
and
passing
it
through
the
suspended
there
when
the
ship
gave
a
plunge
in
the
sudden
swells
of
the
calm
sea
and
pitching
me
still
further
over
the
yard
threw
the
heavy
skirts
of
my
jacket
right
over
my
head
completely
muffling
me
somehow
i
thought
it
was
the
sail
that
had
flapped
and
under
that
impression
threw
up
my
hands
to
drag
it
from
my
head
relying
upon
the
sail
itself
to
support
me
meanwhile
just
then
the
ship
gave
another
sudden
jerk
and
i
pitched
from
the
yard
i
knew
where
i
was
from
the
rush
of
the
air
by
my
ears
but
all
else
was
a
nightmare
a
bloody
film
was
before
my
eyes
through
which
passed
and
repassed
my
father
mother
and
sisters
an
utterable
nausea
oppressed
me
i
was
conscious
of
gasping
there
seemed
no
breath
in
my
body
it
was
over
one
hundred
feet
that
i
down
with
lungs
collapsed
as
in
death
ten
thousand
pounds
of
shot
seemed
tied
to
my
head
as
the
irresistible
law
of
gravitation
dragged
me
head
foremost
and
straight
as
a
die
toward
the
infallible
centre
of
this
terraqueous
globe
all
i
had
seen
and
read
and
heard
and
all
i
had
thought
and
felt
in
my
life
seemed
intensified
in
one
fixed
idea
in
my
soul
but
dense
as
this
idea
was
it
was
made
up
of
atoms
having
fallen
from
the
projecting
end
i
was
conscious
of
a
collected
satisfaction
in
feeling
that
i
should
not
be
dashed
on
the
deck
but
would
sink
into
the
speechless
profound
of
the
sea
with
the
bloody
blind
film
before
my
eyes
there
was
a
still
stranger
hum
in
my
head
as
if
a
hornet
were
there
and
i
thought
to
myself
great
god
this
is
death
yet
these
thoughts
were
unmixed
with
alarm
like
that
flashes
and
shifts
its
scared
hues
in
the
sun
all
my
braided
blended
emotions
were
in
themselves
icy
cold
and
calm
so
protracted
did
my
fall
seem
that
i
can
even
now
recall
the
feeling
of
wondering
how
much
longer
it
would
be
ere
all
was
over
and
i
struck
time
seemed
to
stand
still
and
all
the
worlds
seemed
poised
on
their
poles
as
i
fell
through
the
eddying
whirl
and
swirl
of
the
maelstrom
air
at
first
as
i
have
said
i
must
have
been
precipitated
but
i
was
conscious
at
length
of
a
swift
flinging
motion
of
my
limbs
which
involuntarily
threw
themselves
out
so
that
at
last
i
must
have
fallen
in
a
heap
this
is
more
likely
from
the
circumstance
that
when
i
struck
the
sea
i
felt
as
if
some
one
had
smote
me
slantingly
across
the
shoulder
and
along
part
of
my
right
side
as
i
gushed
into
the
sea
a
sounded
in
my
ear
my
soul
seemed
flying
from
my
mouth
the
feeling
of
death
flooded
over
me
with
the
billows
the
blow
from
the
sea
must
have
turned
me
so
that
i
sank
almost
feet
foremost
through
a
soft
seething
foamy
lull
some
current
seemed
hurrying
me
away
in
a
trance
i
yielded
and
sank
deeper
down
with
a
glide
purple
and
pathless
was
the
deep
calm
now
around
me
flecked
by
summer
lightnings
in
an
azure
afar
the
horrible
nausea
was
gone
the
bloody
blind
film
turned
a
pale
green
i
wondered
whether
i
was
yet
dead
or
still
dying
but
of
a
sudden
some
fashionless
form
brushed
my
inert
coiled
fish
of
the
sea
the
thrill
of
being
alive
again
tingled
in
my
nerves
and
the
strong
shunning
of
death
shocked
me
through
for
one
instant
an
agonising
revulsion
came
over
me
as
i
found
myself
utterly
sinking
next
moment
the
force
of
my
fall
was
expanded
and
there
i
hung
vibrating
in
the
what
wild
sounds
then
rang
in
my
ear
one
was
a
soft
moaning
as
of
low
waves
on
the
beach
the
other
wild
and
heartlessly
jubilant
as
of
the
sea
in
the
height
of
a
tempest
oh
soul
thou
then
heardest
life
and
death
as
he
who
stands
upon
the
corinthian
shore
hears
both
the
ionian
and
the
aegean
waves
the
poise
soon
passed
and
then
i
found
myself
slowly
ascending
and
caught
a
dim
glimmering
of
light
quicker
and
quicker
i
mounted
till
at
last
i
bounded
up
like
a
buoy
and
my
whole
head
was
bathed
in
the
blessed
air
i
had
fallen
in
a
line
with
the
i
now
found
myself
nearly
abreast
of
the
the
frigate
slowly
gliding
by
like
a
black
world
in
the
water
her
vast
hull
loomed
out
of
the
night
showing
hundreds
of
seamen
in
the
some
tossing
over
ropes
others
madly
flinging
overboard
the
hammocks
but
i
was
too
far
out
from
them
immediately
to
reach
what
they
threw
i
essayed
to
swim
toward
the
ship
but
instantly
i
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
like
being
pinioned
in
a
and
moving
my
hands
felt
my
jacket
puffed
out
above
my
tight
girdle
with
water
i
strove
to
tear
it
off
but
it
was
looped
together
here
and
there
and
the
strings
were
not
then
to
be
sundered
by
hand
i
whipped
out
my
knife
that
was
tucked
at
my
belt
and
ripped
my
jacket
straight
up
and
down
as
if
i
were
ripping
open
myself
with
a
violent
struggle
i
then
burst
out
of
it
and
was
free
heavily
soaked
it
slowly
sank
before
my
eyes
sink
sink
oh
shroud
thought
i
sink
forever
accursed
jacket
that
thou
art
that
white
shark
cried
a
horrified
voice
from
the
taffrail
have
that
man
down
his
hatchway
quick
the
the
the
next
instant
that
barbed
bunch
of
harpoons
pierced
through
and
through
the
unfortunate
jacket
and
swiftly
sped
down
with
it
out
of
sight
being
now
astern
of
the
frigate
i
struck
out
boldly
toward
the
elevated
pole
of
one
of
the
which
had
been
cut
away
soon
after
one
of
the
cutters
picked
me
up
as
they
dragged
me
out
of
the
water
into
the
air
the
sudden
transition
of
elements
made
my
every
limb
feel
like
lead
and
i
helplessly
sunk
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
ten
minutes
after
i
was
safe
on
board
and
springing
aloft
was
ordered
to
reeve
anew
the
which
slipping
through
the
blocks
when
i
had
let
go
the
end
had
unrove
and
fallen
to
the
deck
the
sail
was
soon
set
and
as
if
purposely
to
salute
it
a
gentle
breeze
soon
came
and
the
neversink
once
more
glided
over
the
water
a
soft
ripple
at
her
bows
and
leaving
a
tranquil
wake
behind
chapter
xciii
cable
and
anchor
all
clear
and
now
that
the
white
jacket
has
sunk
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
the
blessed
capes
of
virginia
are
believed
to
be
broad
on
our
still
out
of
five
hundred
souls
are
fondly
dreaming
of
home
and
the
iron
throats
of
the
guns
round
the
galley
with
their
songs
and
more
remains
shall
i
tell
what
conflicting
and
almost
crazy
surmisings
prevailed
concerning
the
precise
harbour
for
which
we
were
bound
for
according
to
rumour
our
commodore
had
received
sealed
orders
touching
that
matter
which
were
not
to
be
broken
open
till
we
gained
a
precise
latitude
of
the
coast
shall
i
tell
how
at
last
all
this
uncertainty
departed
and
many
a
foolish
prophecy
was
proved
false
when
our
noble
longest
pennant
at
her
her
stately
way
into
the
innermost
harbour
of
norfolk
like
a
plumed
spanish
grandee
threading
the
corridors
of
the
escurial
toward
the
within
shall
i
tell
how
we
kneeled
upon
the
holy
soil
how
i
begged
a
blessing
of
old
ushant
and
one
precious
hair
of
his
beard
for
a
keepsake
how
lemsford
the
bard
offered
up
a
devout
ode
as
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
how
saturnine
nord
the
magnifico
in
disguise
refusing
all
companionship
stalked
off
into
the
woods
like
the
ghost
of
an
old
calif
of
bagdad
how
i
swayed
and
swung
the
hearty
hand
of
jack
chase
and
nipped
it
to
mine
with
a
carrick
bend
yea
and
kissed
that
noble
hand
of
my
liege
lord
and
captain
of
my
top
my
and
sire
shall
i
tell
how
the
grand
commodore
and
captain
drove
off
from
the
how
the
lieutenants
in
undress
sat
down
to
their
last
dinner
in
the
and
the
champagne
packed
in
ice
spirted
and
sparkled
like
the
hot
springs
out
of
a
in
iceland
how
the
chaplain
went
off
in
his
cassock
without
bidding
the
people
adieu
how
shrunken
cuticle
the
surgeon
stalked
over
the
side
the
wired
skeleton
carried
in
his
wake
by
his
how
the
lieutenant
of
marines
sheathed
his
sword
on
the
poop
and
calling
for
wax
and
a
taper
sealed
the
end
of
the
scabbard
with
his
family
crest
and
coelum
how
the
purser
in
due
time
mustered
his
and
paid
us
all
off
on
the
and
bad
sick
and
well
all
receiving
their
wages
though
truth
to
tell
some
reckless
improvident
seamen
who
had
lived
too
fast
during
the
cruise
had
little
or
nothing
now
standing
on
the
credit
side
of
their
accounts
shall
i
tell
of
the
retreat
of
the
five
hundred
inland
not
alas
in
as
at
quarters
but
scattered
broadcast
over
the
land
shall
i
tell
how
the
neversink
was
at
last
stripped
of
spars
shrouds
and
her
guns
hoisted
and
armouries
not
one
vestige
of
a
fighting
thing
was
left
in
her
from
furthest
stem
to
uttermost
stern
no
let
all
this
go
by
for
our
anchor
still
hangs
from
our
bows
though
its
eager
flukes
dip
their
points
in

impatient
waves

to
grog
the
last
time
for
the
last
time
swung
in
our
hammocks
for
the
last
time
turned
out
at
the
call
of
the
watch
we
have
seen
our
last
man
scourged
at
the
gangway
our
last
man
gasp
out
the
ghost
in
the
stifling
our
last
man
tossed
to
the
sharks
our
last
article
of
war
has
been
read
and
far
inland
in
that
blessed
clime
our
frigate
now
glides
the
last
wrong
in
our
frigate
will
be
remembered
no
more
when
down
from
our
comes
our
pennant
when
down
sinks
its
shooting
stars
from
the
sky
the
mark
nine
sings
the
hoary
old
leadsman
in
the
chains
and
thus
the
equator
passed
our
frigate
strikes
soundings
at
last
hand
in
hand
we
stand
rocked
in
our
pisgah
top
and
over
the
starry
waves
and
broad
out
into
the
blandly
blue
and
boundless
night
spiced
with
strange
sweets
from
the
whole
long
cruise
predestinated
ours
though
often
in
we
almost
refused
to
believe
in
that
out
into
that
fragrant
night
jack
chase
matchless
and
unmatchable
jack
chase
stretches
forth
his
bannered
hand
and
pointing
shoreward
cries
the
last
time
hear
camoens
boys
calm
the
waves
how
mild
the
balmy
gale
the
halcyons
call
ye
lusians
spread
the
sail
appeased
old
ocean
now
shall
rage
no
more
haste
point
our
bowsprit
for
yon
shadowy
shore
soon
shall
the
transports
of
your
natal
soil
in
bounding
joy
the
thoughts
of
every
the
end
as
a
that
sails
through
the
sea
so
this
earth
that
sails
through
the
air
we
mortals
are
all
on
board
a
of
which
god
was
the
shipwright
and
she
is
but
one
craft
in
a
fleet
of
which
god
is
the
lord
high
admiral
the
port
we
sail
from
is
for
ever
astern
and
though
far
out
of
sight
of
land
for
ages
and
ages
we
continue
to
sail
with
sealed
orders
and
our
last
destination
remains
a
secret
to
ourselves
and
our
officers
yet
our
final
haven
was
predestinated
ere
we
slipped
from
the
stocks
at
creation
thus
sailing
with
sealed
orders
we
ourselves
are
the
repositories
of
the
secret
packet
whose
mysterious
contents
we
long
to
learn
there
are
no
mysteries
out
of
ourselves
but
let
us
not
give
ear
to
the
superstitious
gossip
about
whither
we
may
be
gliding
for
as
yet
not
a
soul
on
board
of
us
even
the
commodore
himself
assuredly
not
the
chaplain
even
our
scientific
surmisings
are
vain
on
that
point
the
smallest
is
as
wise
as
the
captain
and
believe
not
the
hypochondriac
dwellers
below
hatches
who
will
tell
you
with
a
sneer
that
our
is
bound
to
no
final
harbour
whatever
that
our
voyage
will
prove
an
endless
circumnavigation
of
space
not
so
for
how
can
this
prove
our
eventual
abiding
place
when
upon
our
first
embarkation
as
infants
in
arms
her
violent
after
life
every
soul
of
us
does
not
this
show
too
that
the
very
air
we
here
inhale
is
uncongenial
and
only
becomes
endurable
at
last
through
gradual
habituation
and
that
some
blessed
placid
haven
however
remote
at
present
must
be
in
store
for
us
all
glance
fore
and
aft
our
flush
decks
what
a
swarming
crew
all
told
they
muster
hard
upon
eight
hundred
millions
of
souls
over
these
we
have
authoritative
lieutenants
a
officer
of
marines
a
chaplain
a
professor
a
purser
a
doctor
a
cook
a
oppressed
by
illiberal
laws
and
partly
oppressed
by
themselves
many
of
our
people
are
wicked
unhappy
inefficient
we
have
skulkers
and
idlers
all
round
and
waisters
who
for
a
pittance
do
our
shabby
work
nevertheless
among
our
people
we
have
gallant
fore
main
and
mizzen
aloft
who
well
treated
or
ill
still
trim
our
craft
to
the
blast
we
have
a
for
trespassers
a
bar
by
our
at
which
they
are
arraigned
a
and
a
gangway
to
degrade
them
in
their
own
eyes
and
in
ours
these
are
not
always
employed
to
convert
sin
to
virtue
but
to
divide
them
and
protect
virtue
and
legalised
sin
from
unlegalised
vice
we
have
a
for
the
smitten
and
helpless
whither
we
hurry
them
out
of
sight
and
however
they
may
groan
beneath
hatches
we
hear
little
of
their
tribulations
on
deck
we
still
sport
our
gay
streamer
aloft
outwardly
regarded
our
craft
is
a
lie
for
all
that
is
outwardly
seen
of
it
is
the
deck
and
planks
comprised
above
the
waterline
whereas
the
vast
mass
of
our
fabric
with
all
its
storerooms
of
secrets
for
ever
slides
along
far
under
the
surface
when
a
shipmate
dies
straightway
we
sew
him
up
and
overboard
he
goes
our
rushes
by
and
never
more
do
we
behold
him
again
though
sooner
or
later
the
everlasting
sweeps
him
toward
our
own
destination
we
have
both
a
to
our
craft
and
a
subterranean
and
gunpowder
magazines
and
the
articles
of
war
form
our
domineering
code
oh
shipmates
and
all
round
we
the
people
suffer
many
abuses
our
is
full
of
complaints
in
vain
from
lieutenants
do
we
appeal
to
the
captain
in
on
board
our
the
indefinite
navy
commissioners
so
far
out
of
sight
aloft
yet
the
worst
of
our
evils
we
blindly
inflict
upon
ourselves
our
officers
can
not
remove
them
even
if
they
would
from
the
last
ills
no
being
can
save
another
therein
each
man
must
be
his
own
saviour
for
the
rest
whatever
befall
us
let
us
never
train
our
murderous
guns
inboard
let
us
not
mutiny
with
bloody
pikes
in
our
hands
our
lord
high
admiral
will
yet
interpose
and
though
long
ages
should
elapse
and
leave
our
wrongs
unredressed
yet
shipmates
and
let
us
never
forget
that
whoever
afflict
us
whatever
surround
life
is
a
voyage
the
end
