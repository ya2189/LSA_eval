in
order
that
there
may
be
no
confusion
we
desire
to
say
that
the
books
listed
above
will
be
issued
during
the
respective
months
in
new
york
city
and
vicinity
they
may
not
reach
the
readers
at
a
distance
promptly
on
account
of
delays
in
transportation
the
eagle
series
principally
copyrights
elegant
colored
covers
the
right
books
at
the
right
price
while
the
books
in
the
new
eagle
series
are
undoubtedly
better
value
being
bigger
books
the
stories
offered
to
the
public
in
this
line
must
not
be
underestimated
there
are
over
four
hundred
copyrighted
books
by
famous
authors
which
can
not
be
had
in
any
other
line
no
other
publisher
in
the
world
has
a
line
that
contains
so
many
different
titles
nor
can
any
publisher
ever
hope
to
secure
books
that
will
match
those
in
the
eagle
series
in
quality
this
is
the
pioneer
line
of
copyrighted
novels
and
that
it
has
struck
popular
fancy
just
right
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
for
fifteen
years
it
has
been
the
first
choice
of
american
readers
the
only
reason
that
we
can
afford
to
give
such
excellent
reading
at
such
a
low
price
is
that
our
unlimited
capital
and
great
organization
enable
us
to
manufacture
books
more
cheaply
and
to
sell
more
of
them
without
expensive
advertising
than
any
other
publishers
all
titles
always
in
print
to
the
public
these
books
are
sold
by
news
dealers
everywhere
if
your
dealer
does
not
keep
them
and
will
not
get
them
for
you
send
direct
to
the
publishers
in
which
case
four
cents
must
be
added
to
the

lisle
nobody
ever
goes
to
portmaris
that
is
to
say
nobody
who
is
anybody
it
lies
but
no
matter
ours
shall
not
be
the
hand
to
ruin
its
simplicity
by
advertising
its
beauties
and
advantages
and
directing
the
madding
crowd
to
its
sylvan
retreat
at
present
the
golden
sands
which
line
the
bay
are
innocent
of
the
negro
troupe
the
peripatetic
conjurer
and
the
monster
in
human
form
who
pesters
you
to
purchase
hideous
objects
manufactured
from
shells
and
cardboard
a
time
may
come
when
portmaris
will
develop
into
an
eastbourne
or
a
brighton
a
scarborough
or
a
hastings
but
heaven
be
praised
that
time
is
not
yet
and
portmaris
like
an
unconscious
village
beauty
goes
on
its
way
as
yet
ignorant
of
its
loveliness
at
present
there
are
about
a
dozen
houses
most
of
them
cottages
a
church
hidden
in
a
hollow
a
mile
away
from
the
restless
sea
and
an
inn
which
is
satisfied
with
being
an
inn
and
has
not
yet
learned
to
call
itself
a
hotel
two
or
three
of
the
fisherfolk
let
lodgings
to
which
come
those
fortunate
individuals
who
have
quite
by
chance
stumbled
upon
this
spot
and
in
the
of
the
prettiest
of
these
unpretentious
cottages
was
a
young
girl
her
name
was
leslie
lisle
she
was
nineteen
slim
graceful
and
more
than
pretty
there
is
a
type
of
beauty
which
with
more
or
less
truth
is
generally
described
as
irish
it
has
dark
hair
blue
eyes
with
long
black
lashes
a
clear
and
colorless
complexion
of
creamy
ivory
and
a
chin
that
would
seem
pointed
but
for
the
exquisite
fullness
of
the
lips
it
is
a
type
which
is
more
fascinating
than
the
severe
greek
more
holding
than
the
voluptuous
spanish
more
spirituel
than
the
vivacious
french
in
short
it
is
a
kind
of
beauty
before
which
most
men
go
down
completely
and
forever
vanquished
and
this
because
the
wonderful
eyes
are
capable
of
an
infinity
of
expressions
can
be
grave
one
moment
and
brimming
over
with
fun
the
next
because
there
lurks
even
when
they
are
most
quiescent
a
world
of
possibilities
in
the
way
of
wit
in
the
corners
of
the
red
lips
because
the
face
as
you
watch
it
can
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
flash
with
spirit
melt
with
tenderness
and
all
the
while
remain
the
face
of
a
pure
innocent
healthy
girl
the
young
men
who
crossed
leslie
lisle
path
underwent
a
sad
experience
at
first
they
were
attracted
by
her
beauty
in
a
few
hours
or
days
as
the
case
might
be
they
began
to
find
the
attraction
lying
somewhat
deeper
than
the
face
then
they
grew
restless
unhappy
lost
their
appetites
got
to
lying
awake
of
nights
and
lastly
went
to
pieces
completely
and
if
they
possessed
sufficient
courage
flung
themselves
perfectly
wretched
and
overcome
at
the
small
feet
of
the
slim
girlish
figure
which
had
become
to
them
even
that
of
the
one
woman
in
the
world
and
to
do
leslie
justice
she
was
not
only
always
surprised
but
distressed
she
had
said
nothing
and
what
is
more
looked
nothing
to
encourage
them
she
had
been
just
herself
a
frank
yet
modest
english
girl
with
an
irish
face
and
that
indescribable
sweetness
which
draws
men
hearts
from
their
bosoms
before
they
know
what
has
happened
to
them
she
was
seated
at
the
piano
in
the
of
the
cottage
which
the
fisherman
who
owned
it
had
christened
sea
view
and
she
was
amusing
herself
and
a
particularly
silent
and
morose
parrot
by
singing
some
of
the
old
songs
and
ballads
which
she
had
found
in
a
rickety
in
the
corner
and
for
all
the
parrot
glanced
at
her
disapprovingly
with
his
glassy
eye
she
had
a
sufficiently
sweet
voice
and
sang
with
more
than
the
usual
amount
of
feeling
while
she
was
in
the
middle
of
that
famous
but
slightly
monotonous
composition
robin
grey
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
thin
man
entered
this
was
francis
lisle
her
father
he
was
a
man
this
side
of
fifty
but
looked
older
in
consequence
perhaps
of
his
hair
which
was
gray
and
scanty
a
faded
face
with
a
dreamy
far
away
look
in
the
faint
blue
eyes
and
a
somewhat
bent
form
and
dragging
gait
he
carried
a
portable
easel
in
one
hand
and
held
a
canvas
under
his
arm
as
he
entered
he
looked
round
the
room
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
then
set
the
easel
up
in
a
corner
placed
the
canvas
on
it
upside
down
and
crossing
his
hands
behind
his
back
stood
with
bent
head
gazing
at
it
for
some
moments
in
silence
then
he
said
in
a
voice
which
matched
the
dreamy
face
leslie
come
here
leslie
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
most
line
of
the
cheerful
ballad
and
walked
no
glided
scarcely
it
is
difficult
to
describe
how
the
girl
got
across
the
small
room
so
full
of
grace
so
characteristic
was
her
mode
of
progression
and
putting
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
leaned
her
cheek
against
his
head
back
already
dear
she
said
and
the
tone
fully
indicated
the
position
in
which
she
stood
toward
her
parent

thought
you
were
going
to
make
a
long
day
of
it
yes
yes
he
said
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
sketch
i
did
intend
doing
so
i
started
full
of
my
subject
and
er
inspired
with
hope
and
i
do
think
i
have
altogether
failed
it
is
difficult
very
the
tone
of
that
sky
would
fill
a
careless
amateur
with
despair
but
but
i
am
not
careless
whatever
i
may
be
i
am
not
that
the
secrets
of
art
which
she
hides
from
the
unthinking
and
er
irreverent
she
confides
to
her
true
worshipers
now
leslie
look
at
that
sky
look
at
it
carefully
critically
and
tell
me
do
you
not
think
i
have
caught
that
half
tone
that
delicious
mingling
of
the
chrome
and
the
ultramarine
there
is
a
wealth
of
form
and
color
in
that
right
hand
corner
and
i
yes
i
think
it
is
the
best
by
far
the
best
and
truest
thing
i
have
as
yet
done
leslie
leaned
forward
and
softly
swiftly
placed
the
picture
right
side
up
it
had
not
very
much
improved
by
the
transposition
it
was
well
to
put
it
bluntly
a
daub
of
the
most
awful
description
never
since
the
world
began
had
there
ever
in
nature
been
anything
like
it
the
average
schoolboy
libeling
nature
with
a
shilling
box
of
colors
could
not
have
sinned
more
deeply
the
sea
was
a
brilliant
blue
the
hills
were
heaps
of
muddy
ochre
the
fishing
vessels
looked
like
blackbeetles
struggling
on
their
backs
there
was
a
cow
in
the
meadow
in
the
foreground
which
would
have
wrung
tears
from
any
one
who
had
ever
set
eyes
on
that
harmless
but
necessary
animal
and
the
bit
of
sky
in
the
corner
was
utterly
and
completely
indescribable
leslie
looked
at
it
with
a
sad
little
expression
in
her
eyes
the
pitying
look
one
sees
in
the
face
of
a
woman
whose
life
is
spent
in
humoring
the
weakness
of
a
beloved
one
then
she
said
gently
it
is
very
striking
papa
striking
repeated
francis
lisle
striking
i
like
that
word
you
too
are
an
artist
my
dear
leslie
though
you
never
touch
a
brush
how
well
you
know
how
to
use
the
exact
expression
i
flatter
myself
that
it
is
striking
i
think
i
may
say
without
egotism
that
no
one
no
real
critic
could
look
at
that
sketch
for
it
is
a
mere
sketch
without
being
struck
yes
papa
she
murmured
soothingly
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
thin
white
hands
in
the
orthodox
fashion
and
peered
at
the
monstrosity
there
is
if
i
may
say
so
an
er
originality
in
the
treatment
which
would
alone
make
the
sketch
interesting
and
valuable
tell
me
now
leslie
what
it
is
in
it
that
catches
your
fancy
most
leslie
looked
at
it
carefully
i
i
think
that
heap
of
nicely
painted
papa
she
said
putting
her
arm
round
his
neck
heap
of
his
brows
knitted
heap
of
i
do
see
anything
of
the
kind
there
papa
she
said
pointing
my
dear
leslie
i
have
always
suspected
that
your
sight
was
not
perfect
that
there
was
some
defect
in
its
range
power
that
is
not
a
heap
of
but
a
fisherwoman
mending
her
nets
of
course
how
stupid
of
me
she
said
quickly
i
afraid
i
am
dear
but
do
you
think
you
have
done
enough
for
why
not
put
it
away
until
there
is
no
leslie
he
said
gravely
as
he
got
out
his
palette
is
long
and
life
is
fleeting
never
forget
that
my
dear
no
i
can
stipple
on
a
little
i
intend
finishing
this
sketch
and
making
a
miniature
a
cabinet
picture
it
shall
be
worthy
of
a
place
among
those
exquisite
studies
of
foster
and
yet
he
sighed
and
pushed
the
hair
from
his
forehead
and
yet
i
be
bound
that
if
i
tried
to
sell
it
i
should
not
find
a
dealer
to
give
me
a
few
paltry
pounds
for
it
so
blind
and
prejudiced
no
they
would
not
buy
it
and
possibly
the
academy
would
refuse
to
exhibit
it
prejudice
prejudice
but
art
has
its
own
rewards
thank
heaven
i
paint
because
i
must
fame
has
no
attraction
i
am
content
to
wait
yes
though
the
recognition
which
is
my
due
may
come
too
late
it
is
often
thus
the
girl
bent
her
beautiful
head
she
stood
taller
than
the
drooping
figure
of
her
father
and
kissed
ah
how
tenderly
pityingly
the
gray
hair
francis
lisle
esquire
the
younger
son
of
an
old
irish
family
had
been
a
dreamer
from
his
youth
up
he
had
started
with
a
good
education
and
a
handsome
little
fortune
he
had
dreamed
away
the
education
dreamed
away
the
small
fortune
dreamed
away
nearly
all
his
life
and
his
great
dream
was
that
he
was
an
artist
he
could
draw
a
haystack
and
certainly
could
not
have
colored
it
correctly
even
if
by
chance
he
had
drawn
it
but
he
was
persuaded
that
he
was
a
great
artist
and
he
fancied
that
his
hand
transferred
to
the
canvas
the
scenes
which
he
attempted
to
paint
and
he
was
not
unhappy
his
wife
had
died
when
leslie
was
a
mite
of
a
thing
and
how
he
had
managed
to
get
on
until
leslie
was
old
enough
to
take
care
of
him
can
never
even
be
surmised
but
she
began
to
play
the
mother
the
guardian
and
protector
to
this
visionary
father
of
hers
at
an
extremely
early
age
she
managed
everything
almost
fed
and
clothed
him
and
kept
from
him
all
those
petty
ills
and
worries
which
make
life
such
a
burden
for
most
people
they
had
no
settled
home
but
wandered
about
sometimes
on
the
continent
but
mostly
in
england
and
francis
lisle
had
hundreds
of
sketches
which
were
like
nothing
under
heaven
but
were
supposed
to
be
ideas
for
larger
pictures
of
places
they
had
visited
they
had
been
at
portmaris
a
couple
of
months
when
we
find
them
and
though
francis
lisle
was
just
beginning
to
get
tired
of
it
and
restlessly
anxious
to
be
on
the
move
again
leslie
was
loth
to
leave
she
had
grown
fond
of
the
golden
sands
the
strip
of
pebbly
beach
the
narrow
street
broken
by
its
trees
the
green
lanes
leading
to
the
country
beyond
and
still
more
fond
of
the
fisher
folk
who
always
welcomed
her
with
a
smile
and
had
already
learned
to
call
her
miss
leslie
indeed
miss
lisle
was
a
dangerous
young
woman
and
the
hearts
of
young
and
old
gentle
and
simple
went
down
before
a
glance
of
her
eyes
a
smile
from
the
mobile
lips
a
word
from
her
voice
which
thrilled
with
a
melody
few
could
resist
francis
lisle
went
on
daubing
his
head
on
one
side
a
rapt
contented
look
on
his
pale
aristocratic
face
yes
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
my
best
efforts
he
said
with
placid
complacency
go
and
sing
something
leslie
i
can
always
work
better
while
you
are
singing
music
and
painting
are
twin
sisters
i
adore
them
both
leslie
went
back
to
the
piano
with
that
peculiarly
graceful
motion
of
hers
and
touched
a
note
or
two
were
there
no
letters
this
morning
dear
she
asked
letters
lisle
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
as
if
rudely
called
back
to
earth
from
the
empyrean
letters
no
yes
i
forgot
there
was
one
it
was
from
ralph
duncombe
leslie
turned
her
head
slightly
and
the
rather
thick
brows
which
helped
the
eyes
in
all
their
unconscious
mischief
straightened
from
ralph
what
does
he
say
i
do
know
replied
lisle
placidly
i
can
never
read
his
letters
he
writes
so
terribly
plain
a
hand
its
hardness
jars
upon
me
i
have
it
somewhere
he
searched
his
pockets
reluctantly
no
i
must
have
lost
it
does
it
matter
very
much
leslie
laughed
softly
i
do
know
but
one
generally
likes
to
know
what
is
in
a
letter
well
then
i
wish
i
could
find
it
i
told
the
postman
when
he
gave
it
to
me
that
i
should
probably
lose
it
and
that
he
had
better
bring
it
on
to
the
house
but
well
i
do
think
he
understood
me
i
often
think
that
we
speak
an
unknown
language
to
these
country
people
perhaps
he
did
not
hear
you
said
leslie
sometimes
you
know
dear
you
think
you
have
spoken
when
you
have
not
uttered
a
word
but
only
thought
i
dare
say
he
assented
dreamily
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
fancy
duncombe
said
he
was
coming
down
here
the
slender
white
hands
which
had
been
touching
the
keys
caressingly
stopped
coming
here
papa
yes
i
think
so
i
not
sure
now
what
could
i
have
done
with
that
letter
he
made
another
search
failed
to
find
it
shook
his
head
as
if
dismissing
the
subject
and
resumed
his
work
leslie
struck
a
chord
and
opened
her
lips
to
sing
when
the
sound
of
the
wheels
belonging
to
the
one
fly
in
the
place
came
down
the
uneven
street
she
paused
to
listen
then
leaned
sideways
and
looked
through
the
window
the
station
fly
she
said
and
it
has
stopped
at
marine
villa
papa
it
must
be
another
visitor
fancy
two
visitors
at
the
same
time
in
portmaris
it
will
go
wild
with
excitement
the
cranky
vehicle
had
pulled
up
at
the
opposite
cottage
and
leslie
with
mild
very
mild
curiosity
got
up
from
the
piano
and
went
to
the
window
as
she
did
so
a
man
dressed
in
soft
tweed
got
down
from
beside
the
driver
opened
the
and
gave
his
arm
to
a
young
man
whose
appearance
filled
leslie
heart
with
pity
for
he
was
a
cripple
his
back
was
bent
his
face
pale
and
gentle
as
a
woman
marked
with
lines
which
were
eloquent
of
weary
days
and
still
more
weary
nights
and
in
the
dark
eyes
was
that
peculiar
expression
of
sadness
which
a
life
of
pain
and
suffering
patiently
borne
sets
as
a
seal
the
young
fellow
leaned
on
his
stick
and
the
man
arm
and
looked
round
him
and
his
eye
dark
and
full
of
a
soft
penetration
fell
upon
the
lovely
face
at
the
opposite
window
leslie
drew
back
when
it
was
too
late
and
breathed
an
exclamation
of
regret
oh
papa
what
is
the
matter
asked
lisle
vacantly
i
am
sorry
she
said
he
will
think
i
was
staring
at
him
and
so
i
was
and
that
will
seem
so
cruel
to
him
poor
fellow
what
is
cruel
which
poor
fellow
demanded
lisle
with
feeble
impatience
some
one
who
has
just
got
out
of
the
fly
dear
a
cripple
poor
fellow
and
he
saw
me
watching
him
and
she
sighed
again
eh
said
lisle
as
if
he
were
trying
to
recollect
something
ah
yes
i
remember
whiting
told
me
that
he
was
expected
some
time
they
had
a
telegram
saying
he
was
coming
he
who
said
leslie
going
back
to
the
piano
who
repeated
lisle
as
if
he
were
heartily
sorry
he
had
continued
the
subject
why
this
young
man
dear
me
i
forget
his
name
and
title
title
poor
fellow
is
he
a
nobleman
papa
that
makes
it
seem
so
much
worse
does
it
lisle
looked
round
at
her
helplessly
upon
my
word
my
dear
he
said
i
do
not
wish
to
appear
dense
but
i
have
the
least
idea
of
what
you
are
talking
about
and
he
went
on
more
quietly
as
if
he
feared
she
were
going
to
explain
it
matter
pray
sing
something
and
and
do
not
let
us
worry
about
things
which
do
not
concern
us
leslie
began
to
sing
without
another
word
chapter
ii
fate
the
crippled
young
man
with
the
assistance
of
his
companion
made
his
way
into
the
of
marine
villa
an
invalid
chair
was
hauled
from
the
top
of
the
fly
and
carried
in
and
the
young
man
sank
into
it
with
a
faint
sigh
leave
me
grey
he
said
when
lord
auchester
arrives
let
him
come
to
me
at
once
and
grey
be
good
enough
to
remember
what
i
told
you
yes
your
grace
said
the
man
then
as
his
master
lifted
the
soft
brown
eyes
with
gentle
reproach
he
added
correcting
himself
yes
sir
the
young
man
smiled
faintly
that
is
better
thanks
the
valet
unlocked
a
morocco
traveling
case
and
took
out
a
vial
and
medicine
chest
the
medicine
your
gra
sir
i
mean
ah
yes
i
forgot
thank
you
said
the
young
man
and
he
took
the
draught
with
a
weary
patience
thanks
let
me
know
when
his
lordship
arrives
no
i
want
nothing
more
the
valet
went
out
shutting
the
door
softly
after
him
and
his
master
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
closed
his
eyes
fate
had
dealt
very
strangely
with
this
young
man
with
one
hand
it
had
showered
upon
him
most
of
the
gifts
which
the
sons
of
men
set
high
store
by
it
had
made
him
a
duke
had
given
him
palaces
vast
lands
money
in
such
abundance
as
to
be
almost
a
burden
and
with
the
other
hand
as
if
in
scorn
and
derision
of
the
thing
called
man
fate
had
struck
him
one
of
those
blows
under
which
humanity
is
crushed
and
broken
a
nurse
had
let
him
when
a
child
slip
from
her
arms
and
the
great
duke
of
rothbury
was
doomed
to
go
through
life
a
stunted
and
object
with
the
grim
figure
of
pain
always
marching
by
his
side
with
the
bitter
knowledge
that
not
all
his
wealth
could
prevent
the
people
he
met
in
the
streets
regarding
him
with
curious
and
pitying
glances
with
the
bitter
sense
that
the
poorest
of
the
laborers
on
his
estates
enjoyed
a
better
lot
than
his
and
was
more
to
be
envied
than
himself
he
sat
perfectly
motionless
for
some
minutes
then
he
opened
his
eyes
and
started
slightly
leslie
had
just
begun
to
sing
he
wheeled
his
chair
to
the
window
and
set
it
open
quietly
and
keeping
behind
the
curtains
listened
with
evident
pleasure
the
song
was
still
floating
across
to
him
when
a
young
man
came
marching
up
the
street
youth
is
a
glorious
thing
under
any
circumstances
but
when
it
is
combined
with
perfect
health
good
temper
a
handsome
face
and
a
stalwart
form
it
is
in
its
force
and
influence
the
little
narrow
street
of
portmaris
seemed
somehow
to
grow
brighter
and
wider
as
the
young
man
strode
up
it
his
form
swaying
a
little
to
right
and
left
his
head
perfectly
poised
his
bright
eyes
glancing
here
and
there
with
intelligent
interest
the
lips
whistling
softly
from
sheer
he
stopped
as
he
came
opposite
sea
view
and
listened
to
leslie
song
nodding
his
head
approvingly
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
marine
villa
on
the
opposite
house
and
walked
straight
into
the
little
hall
hallo
grey
he
said
and
his
voice
rang
not
hardly
and
unpleasantly
but
with
that
clear
golden
timbre
which
only
belongs
to
the
voice
of
a
man
in
perfect
health
here
you
are
then
and
how
is
grey
smiled
as
he
bent
his
head
respectfully
everybody
was
glad
to
see
the
young
man
yes
my
lord
just
got
down
his
gra
we
are
pretty
well
considering
the
journey
my
lord
he
will
see
your
lordship
at
once
all
right
said
the
young
fellow
i
rode
as
far
as
northcliffe
but
left
the
horse
there
as
i
did
know
what
sort
of
stables
they
have
here
you
were
right
my
lord
said
grey
in
the
approving
tone
of
a
confidential
servant
this
seems
a
rare
place
and
i
should
doubt
there
being
a
decent
stable
here
ah
well
the
duke
will
like
it
all
the
better
for
being
quiet
the
young
fellow
said
grey
put
his
hand
to
his
lips
and
coughed
apologetically
beg
pardon
my
lord
but
his
gra
that
is
well
you
excuse
me
my
lord
but
we
down
here
quite
as
you
may
say
as
lord
auchester
staring
at
the
man
was
about
to
laugh
the
clear
rather
shrill
voice
of
the
invalid
was
heard
from
the
room
is
that
you
yorke
why
do
you
not
come
in
the
young
fellow
entered
and
took
the
long
thin
hand
the
duke
extended
to
him
hallo
dolph
he
said
lowering
his
voice
how
are
you
what
made
you
think
of
coming
to
this
outlandish
spot
the
duke
still
holding
his
cousin
hand
smiled
up
at
him
with
a
mixture
of
sadness
and
self
raillery
i
ca
tell
you
yorke
i
got
tired
of
town
and
told
grey
to
hunt
up
some
place
in
bradshaw
that
he
had
never
heard
of
some
place
right
out
of
the
beaten
track
and
he
chose
this
poor
unfortunate
man
said
lord
auchester
with
a
laugh
yes
grey
suffers
a
great
deal
from
my
moods
and
humors
and
so
do
other
persons
yourself
to
wit
yorke
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
come
to
me
so
soon
of
course
i
came
said
lord
auchester
i
was
very
far
off
you
see
fishing
said
the
duke
with
evident
interest
oh
yes
replied
the
other
young
man
quickly
i
rode
over
as
far
as
northcliffe
the
duke
sighed
as
his
eyes
wandered
musingly
over
the
stalwart
frame
you
ought
to
have
been
in
the
army
yorke
he
said
lord
auchester
laughed
so
i
should
have
been
if
they
had
made
the
possession
of
brains
a
qua
it
seems
you
want
brains
for
pretty
nearly
everything
nowadays
and
it
just
brains
i
short
of
you
see
dolph
you
have
everything
else
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
he
sighed
and
turned
his
head
away
not
that
he
envied
his
cousin
his
handsome
face
and
straight
limbs
you
have
told
me
what
you
wanted
me
for
dolph
said
lord
auchester
after
a
pause
during
which
both
men
had
been
listening
half
unconsciously
to
the
sweet
voice
in
the
cottage
opposite
i
wanted
nothing
said
the
duke
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
unless
with
a
sigh
and
a
wistful
smile
unless
you
can
by
the
wave
of
a
magician
wand
change
this
crooked
body
of
mine
for
something
like
your
own
i
would
if
i
could
dolph
said
the
other
bending
over
him
and
laying
a
pair
of
strong
hands
soothingly
on
the
invalid
bent
shoulders
i
know
that
yorke
but
you
can
not
can
you
i
dare
say
you
think
i
am
a
peevish
discontented
wretch
and
that
i
ought
as
the
poor
emperor
of
germany
said
to
bear
my
pain
without
complaining
no
dolph
i
think
you
complain
very
little
and
face
the
music
first
rate
put
in
the
other
thanks
i
try
to
most
times
and
i
could
succeed
better
than
i
do
if
i
were
always
alone
but
sometimes
he
sighed
bitterly
why
is
it
that
the
world
is
so
false
yorke
are
there
no
honest
men
besides
you
and
grey
and
half
a
dozen
others
i
could
mention
and
are
there
no
honest
women
at
all
yorke
auchester
raised
his
eyebrows
and
laughed
what
wrong
with
the
women
he
said
the
duke
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
partially
hid
his
face
which
had
suddenly
become
red
everything
is
wrong
with
them
yorke
he
said
gravely
and
in
a
low
voice
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
not
know
how
i
esteem
reverence
respect
a
woman
perhaps
because
i
dare
not
love
them
yorke
auchester
nodded
if
all
the
men
felt
as
you
do
about
women
there
would
be
no
bad
ones
in
the
world
dolph
he
said
to
me
there
is
something
sacred
in
the
very
word
my
heart
expands
grows
warm
in
the
presence
of
a
good
woman
i
can
not
look
at
a
beautiful
girl
without
thinking
do
misunderstand
me
yorke
no
no
old
chap
i
love
i
reverence
them
and
yet
they
have
made
me
fly
from
london
have
caused
me
almost
to
vow
that
i
will
never
go
back
that
i
will
hide
my
misshapen
self
for
the
rest
of
my
weary
days
why
dolph
listen
said
the
duke
look
at
me
yorke
ah
it
is
unnecessary
you
know
what
i
am
a
thing
for
women
to
pity
to
shudder
at
not
to
love
and
yet
he
hid
his
face
some
of
them
have
tried
to
persuade
me
that
i
could
inspire
a
young
girl
with
love
that
i
oh
think
of
it
yorke
that
i
had
only
to
offer
myself
as
a
husband
to
the
most
beautiful
the
fairest
straightest
queenliest
of
them
to
be
accepted
yorke
auchester
leaned
over
him
you
take
these
things
too
seriously
dolph
he
said
soothingly
it
it
the
way
of
the
world
and
you
ca
better
it
you
must
take
it
as
it
comes
the
way
of
the
world
that
a
girl
young
beautiful
graceful
should
be
sold
by
her
mother
and
father
should
be
willing
to
sell
herself
ah
yorke
to
a
thing
like
me
is
that
the
way
of
the
world
what
a
wicked
heartless
vicious
world
then
and
what
an
unhappy
wretch
am
i
what
fools
they
are
too
yorke
they
think
it
is
so
fine
a
thing
to
wear
a
ducal
coronet
ha
ha
he
laughed
with
sad
bitterness
so
fine
that
they
would
barter
their
souls
to
the
evil
one
to
feel
the
pressure
of
that
same
coronet
on
their
brows
to
hear
other
women
call
them
grace
oh
yorke
what
fools
how
i
could
open
their
eyes
if
they
would
let
me
look
at
me
i
am
the
duke
of
rothbury
knight
of
the
garter
poor
garter
and
he
looked
at
his
thin
leg
and
what
else
i
almost
forget
some
of
my
titles
and
i
would
swap
them
all
for
a
straight
back
and
stalwart
limbs
like
yours
but
yorke
to
share
those
titles
how
many
women
would
let
me
limp
to
the
altar
on
their
arms
he
laughed
again
still
more
bitterly
sometimes
when
some
girl
with
the
look
of
an
angel
in
her
eyes
with
a
voice
like
a
heavenly
harmony
is
making
what
they
call
dead
set
at
me
i
have
hard
work
to
restrain
myself
from
telling
her
what
i
think
of
her
and
those
who
set
her
at
me
yorke
it
is
this
part
of
the
business
which
makes
my
life
almost
unendurable
and
it
is
only
by
running
away
from
every
one
who
knows
or
has
heard
of
the
duke
of
rothbury
that
i
can
put
up
with
existence
poor
old
chap
murmured
lord
auchester
just
now
continued
the
duke
as
we
drove
up
to
the
door
i
caught
sight
of
a
beautiful
girl
at
the
window
opposite
i
saw
her
face
grow
soft
with
pity
with
the
angelic
pity
of
a
woman
which
though
it
stings
and
cuts
into
one
like
a
cut
from
a
whip
i
try
to
be
grateful
for
she
pitied
me
not
knowing
who
and
what
i
am
tell
her
that
i
am
the
duke
of
rothbury
and
in
five
minutes
or
less
that
angelic
look
of
compassion
will
be
exchanged
for
the
one
which
you
see
on
the
face
of
the
hunter
as
his
prey
comes
within
sight
she
will
think
is
ugly
crooked
maimed
for
life
but
he
is
a
man
and
i
can
therefore
marry
him
he
is
a
duke
and
i
should
be
a
duchess
and
so
like
a
moral
poison
like
some
plague
i
blight
the
souls
of
the
best
and
purest
listen
to
her
now
that
is
the
girl
singing
what
is
it
i
can
hear
the
words
he
held
up
his
hand
leslie
was
singing
quite
unconscious
of
the
two
listeners
my
sweet
girl
love
with
frank
blue
eyes
though
years
have
passed
i
see
you
still
there
where
you
stood
beside
the
mill
beneath
the
bright
autumnal
skies
though
years
have
passed
i
love
you
yet
do
you
still
remember
or
do
you
forget
a
nice
voice
said
yorke
auchester
approvingly
yes
the
voice
of
a
no
doubt
she
is
one
she
needs
only
to
be
informed
that
an
unmarried
duke
is
within
reach
and
she
be
in
a
hurry
to
drop
to
the
earth
and
in
her
hurry
to
reach
and
secure
him
will
not
mind
dragging
her
white
wings
in
the
mud
women
are
built
that
way
said
yorke
auchester
concisely
the
duke
sighed
oh
yes
they
are
all
alike
yorke
what
a
fine
duke
you
would
have
made
what
a
mischievous
spiteful
old
cat
fate
is
to
make
me
a
duke
and
you
only
a
younger
son
how
is
it
you
do
hate
and
envy
me
yorke
because
i
not
a
cad
and
a
beast
i
suppose
replied
the
young
fellow
pleasantly
why
dolph
you
have
been
the
best
friend
a
man
ever
had
most
men
hate
their
best
friends
put
in
the
duke
with
a
sad
smile
where
should
i
have
been
but
for
you
continued
yorke
auchester
ignoring
the
parenthesis
you
have
lugged
me
out
of
queer
street
by
the
scruff
of
my
neck
half
a
dozen
times
every
penny
i
ever
had
came
from
you
and
i
had
a
mint
a
complete
mint
and
by
the
way
dolph
i
want
some
more
the
duke
laughed
wearily
take
as
much
as
you
want
yorke
he
said
but
for
you
the
money
would
grow
and
grow
till
it
buried
and
smothered
me
i
can
not
spend
it
you
must
help
me
i
will
i
always
have
said
yorke
auchester
laughing
it
a
pity
you
have
got
some
expensive
fad
dolph
pictures
or
coins
or
first
editions
or
racing
the
duke
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
only
one
fad
he
said
to
be
strong
and
straight
and
that
not
even
the
rothbury
money
can
gratify
but
i
do
get
some
pleasure
out
of
your
expenditure
i
fancy
you
enjoy
yourself
i
do
yes
that
is
well
some
day
you
will
marry
yorke
auchester
hand
dropped
from
the
duke
shoulder
marry
some
young
girl
who
loves
you
for
yourself
alone
she
not
likely
to
love
me
for
anything
else
all
the
better
oh
heaven
what
would
i
not
give
for
such
a
love
as
that
broke
out
the
duke
as
the
passionate
exclamation
left
his
lips
the
door
opened
and
whiting
the
landlady
came
in
her
face
was
flushed
she
was
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
caused
by
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
fear
i
beg
your
pardon
your
grace
she
faltered
puffing
timorously
but
did
you
ring
the
duke
looked
straight
at
the
woman
and
then
up
at
yorke
auchester
no
said
yorke
i
beg
your
grace
pardon
the
curious
woman
began
stammeringly
but
grey
coming
behind
her
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
none
too
gently
swung
her
into
the
passage
and
closed
the
door
the
duke
looked
down
frowningly
they
found
you
out
dolph
said
yorke
the
duke
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
sighed
yes
i
suppose
so
i
do
not
know
how
i
am
sorry
i
had
hoped
to
stay
here
in
peace
for
a
few
weeks
at
any
rate
but
i
must
go
now
better
to
be
in
london
where
everybody
knows
me
and
has
to
an
extent
grown
accustomed
to
me
he
stopped
short
and
his
face
reddened
yorke
he
said
do
you
think
she
knew
which
of
us
was
the
duke
i
do
know
replied
yorke
i
do
think
she
did
she
would
naturally
think
it
was
you
if
she
did
know
said
the
duke
thoughtfully
his
eyes
resting
on
the
tall
form
of
his
cousin
who
had
gone
to
the
window
and
was
looking
at
the
cottage
opposite
she
would
never
imagine
me
the
cripple
do
some
of
these
simple
folk
think
that
a
king
is
always
at
least
six
feet
and
a
half
and
that
he
lives
and
sleeps
in
a
crown
yes
you
look
more
like
a
duke
than
i
do
yorke
and
i
wish
to
heaven
you
were
thanks
said
yorke
auchester
not
too
attentively
what
a
pretty
little
scrap
of
a
place
this
is
dolph
and
ah
he
stopped
short
by
jove
dolph
what
a
lovely
girl
is
that
the
one
of
whom
you
were
speaking
just
now
the
duke
put
the
plain
muslin
curtain
aside
and
looked
leslie
had
come
to
the
window
and
stood
all
unconscious
of
being
watched
with
her
arms
raised
above
her
head
in
the
act
of
putting
a
lump
of
sugar
between
the
bars
of
the
parrot
cage
the
duke
gazed
at
her
at
first
with
an
expression
of
reverent
admiration
ah
yes
beautiful
he
murmured
then
his
face
hardened
and
darkened
how
good
how
sweet
how
innocent
she
looks
and
yet
i
wager
all
i
own
that
she
is
no
better
than
the
rest
that
with
all
her
angelic
eyes
and
sweet
childlike
lips
she
will
be
ready
to
barter
her
beauty
her
youth
her
soul
for
rank
and
wealth
he
groaned
and
clutched
his
chair
with
his
long
thin
and
alas
hands
i
can
not
bear
it
yorke
i
meant
to
conceal
my
title
and
while
i
staid
down
here
pretend
to
be
just
a
poor
man
an
ordinary
commoner
one
who
would
not
tempt
any
girl
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
her
soul
i
should
have
liked
to
have
made
a
friend
of
that
girl
to
have
seen
her
talked
with
her
every
day
without
the
perpetual
dread
that
she
would
try
and
make
me
marry
her
but
it
is
too
late
it
seems
this
woman
here
knows
everybody
in
the
place
knows
or
will
know
it
is
too
late
unless
he
stopped
and
looked
up
yorke
hallo
said
that
young
fellow
scarcely
turning
his
head
will
you
do
you
mind
you
say
you
owe
me
something
faltered
the
duke
eagerly
why
of
course
assented
yorke
auchester
and
he
came
and
bent
over
him
what
the
matter
dolph
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
just
this
said
the
duke
laying
his
hand
it
trembled
on
the
strong
arm
be
the
duke
of
rothbury
for
a
time
and
let
this
miserable
cripple
sink
into
the
background
you
will
not
refuse
say
it
is
a
whim
a
mere
fad
sick
people
he
smiled
bitterly
are
entitled
to
these
whims
and
fads
you
know
and
i
not
had
many
humor
this
one
be
the
duke
and
save
me
for
once
from
the
humiliation
which
every
young
girl
inflicts
upon
me
yorke
auchester
brow
darkened
and
he
bit
his
lip
rather
a
rum
idea
old
chap
is
it
he
said
with
an
uneasy
laugh
call
it
so
if
you
like
responded
the
duke
with
if
possible
increased
eagerness
are
you
going
to
refuse
me
yorke
by
heaven
his
thin
face
flushed
it
is
the
first
the
only
thing
i
have
ever
asked
of
you
hold
on
interrupted
yorke
auchester
almost
sternly
i
did
not
say
i
would
refuse
you
know
that
i
can
not
you
have
been
the
best
friend
the
duke
raised
his
hand
i
knew
you
would
not
ring
the
bell
will
you
his
voice
his
hand
as
he
pointed
to
the
bell
trembled
yorke
auchester
strode
across
the
room
and
rang
the
bell
grey
entered
grey
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
how
came
this
woman
to
know
my
name
it
was
a
mistake
your
grace
said
grey
troubled
and
remorseful
i
let
it
slip
when
i
was
wiring
and
the
idiot
at
the
telegraph
station
in
london
must
have
wired
it
down
to
the
people
on
his
own
account
but
but
your
grace
she
does
know
much
after
all
for
she
know
which
is
the
dook
as
she
calls
it
beggin
your
pardon
your
grace
the
duke
nodded
clasping
his
hands
impatiently
and
eagerly
ring
the
bell
stand
aside
and
say
nothing
he
said
in
a
tone
of
stern
command
which
he
seldom
used
the
landlady
who
like
hamlet
was
fat
and
scant
of
breath
was
heard
panting
up
the
stairs
knocked
timidly
and
in
response
to
the
come
in
entered
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
fearsome
curious
fashion
did
you
ring
she
would
not
venture
to
say
your
grace
this
time
the
duke
smiled
at
her
yes
he
said
gravely
but
pleasantly
his

the
duke
of
rothbury
will
stay
with
me
for
a
few
days
if
you
can
give
him
a
room
whiting
sir
if
you
please
oh
certainly
sir
and
she
dropped
a
courtesy
to
yorke
auchester
certainly
your
grace
it
humble
and
homely
like
but
grey
edged
her
gently
and
persuasively
out
of
the
room
and
when
he
had
followed
her
the
duke
leaned
back
his
chair
and
looking
up
at
the
handsome
face
of
his
cousin
laughed
it
like
a
scene
in
one
of
the
new
farces
is

i
beg
your
pardon
godolphin
duke

farce
yes
but
at
that
moment
began
the
tragedy
of
leslie
lisle
life
chapter
iii
ralph
duncombe
the
great
artist
went
on
painting
making
the
sketch
more
hideously
and
idiotically
unnatural
every
minute
and
was
so
absorbed
in
it
that
leslie
could
not
persuade
him
to
leave
it
even
for
his
lunch
and
he
maundered
from
the
table
to
the
easel
with
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
in
his
hand
or
held
between
his
teeth
as
if
he
were
a
performing
dog
leslie
had
played
and
sung
to
him
until
she
was
tired
and
she
cast
a
wistful
glance
from
the
window
toward
the
blue
sky
and
sunlit
sea
wo
you
leave
it
for
a
little
while
and
come
out
on
the
beach
dear
she
said
coaxingly
but
francis
lisle
shook
his
head
no
no
i
am
just
in
the
vein
leslie
nothing
would
induce
me
to
lose
this
light
but
i
wish
you
would
go
it
it
fidgets
and
unsettles
me
to
have
any
one
in
the
room
who
wants
to
be
elsewhere
go
out
for
your
walk
when
you
come
back
you
will
see
what
i
have
made
of
it
i
flatter
myself
you
will
be
surprised
if
she
were
not
it
would
only
be
because
she
had
seen
so
many
similar
pictures
of
his
she
put
on
her
hat
and
dainty
little
norfolk
jacket
of
scotch
homespun
and
went
out
with
a
handkerchief
of
his
she
was
hemming
in
her
pocket
the
narrow
street
was
bathed
in
sunshine
at
the
open
doors
some
of
the
fisher
wives
were
sitting
or
standing
at
their
eternal
knitting
children
were
playing
noisily
in
the
the
women
one
and
all
looked
up
and
smiled
as
she
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
and
one
or
two
little
mites
ran
to
her
with
the
fearless
joyousness
which
is
the
child
indication
of
love
leslie
lifted
one
tiny
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
clustering
curls
and
kissed
her
patted
the
bare
heads
of
the
rest
and
nodded
pleasantly
to
the
mothers
may
we
come
with
asked
the
mite
but
leslie
shook
her
head
not
this
afternoon
trotty
she
said
and
ran
away
from
them
down
the
street
which
led
sheer
on
to
the
beach
as
a
rule
she
allowed
the
children
to
accompany
her
and
play
round
her
as
she
sat
at
work
but
this
afternoon
she
wanted
to
be
alone
the
arrival
of
the
letter
which
her
father
had
lost
had
disturbed
and
troubled
her
the
man
from
whom
it
had
come
was
a
certain
ralph
duncombe
and
he
was
one
of
the
many
unfortunates
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
but
unlike
the
rest
he
had
not
been
content
to
take
no
for
an
answer
and
gone
away
and
got
over
it
or
drowned
himself
but
had
persisted
in
hoping
and
striving
she
had
met
him
at
a
boarding
house
two
years
before
this
had
been
pleasant
and
kind
to
him
as
she
was
to
everybody
but
had
meant
nothing
more
than
kindliness
and
was
surprised
and
pained
when
he
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
and
declined
to
take
a
refusal
since
that
time
he
had
cropped
up
at
intervals
like
a
tax
collector
and
it
seemed
as
if
leslie
would
never
convince
him
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
his
persistence
distressed
her
very
much
but
she
did
not
know
what
she
could
do
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
having
set
his
heart
upon
a
thing
would
work
with
a
dogged
earnestness
until
he
had
got
it
and
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
women
hearts
are
not
to
be
won
like
a
town
by
a
siege
however
long
and
stringent
it
may
be
she
went
down
to
the
breakwater
and
sat
down
in
her
favorite
spot
and
got
out
her
handkerchief
and
two
minutes
afterward
there
was
a
on
the
stones
behind
her
and
a
small
terrier
leaped
on
her
lap
with
a
joyous
yap
she
laughed
and
hugged
him
for
a
moment
then
forced
him
down
beside
her
oh
dick
what
a
wicked
dick
you
are
you
run
the
needle
into
my
finger
sir
she
said
look
there
and
she
held
out
a
tapering
forefinger
with
one
little
red
drop
on
it
dick
smiled
in
dog
fashion
and
attempted
to
bite
the
finger
but
to
his
surprise
and
disgust
leslie
refused
to
play
i
too
busy
dick
she
said
gravely
i
want
to
finish
this
handkerchief
besides
it
too
hot
suppose
you
coil
yourself
up
like
a
good
little
doggie
and
go
to
sleep
well
if
you
must
you
must
i
suppose
and
she
let
him
snuggle
into
her
lap
where
seeing
that
she
really
meant
it
he
immediately
went
to
sleep
it
was
a
lovely
afternoon
there
was
no
one
on
the
beach
excepting
herself
and
all
was
silent
save
for
the
drowsy
yawing
of
the
gulls
and
the
heavy
boom
of
the
tide
as
it
went
out
for
the
sea
was
very
seldom
calm
at
portmaris
and
in
the
least
windy
of
days
there
was
generally
a
on
leslie
sat
and
worked
and
thought
thought
mostly
of
ralph
duncombe
her
persistent
suitor
but
once
or
twice
the
remembrance
of
the
deformed
cripple
who
had
come
to
lodge
at
marine
villa
crossed
her
mind
and
she
was
thinking
of
him
pityingly
when
the
sound
of
footsteps
crunching
firmly
and
uncompromisingly
over
the
pebbles
made
her
start
and
caused
the
terrier
to
leap
up
with
the
fury
of
its
kind
leslie
brows
came
together
as
she
looked
up
a
young
man
with
broad
shoulders
and
a
rather
clumsy
but
steady
gait
was
coming
down
the
beach
he
was
not
a
man
he
had
a
big
head
and
red
hair
a
large
mouth
and
a
square
jaw
his
feet
and
hands
were
also
large
and
there
was
in
his
air
and
manner
something
which
indicated
aggressiveness
and
obstinacy
sharp
men
who
had
seen
him
as
a
boy
had
said
that
chap
will
get
on
and
unlike
most
prophets
they
had
been
correct
ralph
duncombe
had
got
on
he
had
started
as
an
errand
boy
in
a
city
office
and
had
risen
step
by
step
until
he
had
become
a
partner
rawlings
had
always
been
well
thought
of
in
the
city
but
rawlings
and
duncombe
had
now
become
respected
and
eminent
his
square
resolute
face
flushed
as
he
saw
her
but
the
hand
with
which
he
took
off
his
hat
was
as
steady
as
a
rock
miss
lisle
he
said
making
his
voice
heard
above
the
dull
roar
of
the
sea
and
the
shrill
barking
of
the
terrier
leslie
held
out
one
hand
while
she
held
the
furiously
struggling
dick
with
the
other
he
took
her
hand
in
his
huge
fist
and
dropped
heavily
on
the
shingle
beside
her
i
did
know
you
had
a
dog
he
said
glancing
at
her
and
then
at
the
dog
and
then
at
the
sea
as
a
man
does
who
is
so
much
in
love
that
he
can
not
bear
the
glory
of
his
mistress
face
all
at
once
i
have
said
leslie
laughing
in
the
slow
soft
way
which
her
adorers
found
so
bewitching
and
agonizing
he
does
really
belong
to
me
though
he
pretends
that
he
does
he
is
the
abandoned
little
animal
of
merrick
our
landlady
but
he
will
follow
me
about
and
make
a
nuisance
of
himself
be
quiet
dick
or
i
shall
send
you
home
i
not
surprised
said
ralph
duncombe
with
a
slight
flush
and
still
avoiding
her
eyes
i
can
sympathize
with
dick
leslie
colored
and
took
up
her
work
leaving
dick
to
wander
gingerly
round
the
visitor
and
smell
him
inquisitively
you
got
my
letter
miss
leslie
no
she
said
i
am
very
sorry
but
papa
lost
it
he
smiled
as
if
he
were
not
astonished
it
does
matter
he
said
it
only
said
that
i
was
coming
and
here
i
am
i
i
will
go
and
tell
papa
you
will
come
and
have
some
lunch
no
do
get
up
he
said
quickly
putting
out
his
hand
to
stay
her
i
had
my
lunch
and
i
can
go
and
see
lisle
presently
if
he
paused
miss
leslie
i
suppose
you
know
why
i
have
come
down
here
leslie
bent
her
head
over
her
work
she
could
guess
such
a
man
as
ralph
duncombe
was
not
likely
to
come
down
to
such
a
place
as
portmaris
in
obedience
to
a
mere
whim
i
come
down
because
i
said
that
i
would
come
about
this
time
he
went
on
slowly
and
firmly
as
if
he
had
well
rehearsed
his
speech
as
indeed
he
had
i
a
man
who
when
he
has
set
his
heart
upon
anything
does
change
or
give
it
up
because
he
does
happen
to
get
it
all
at
once
i
set
my
heart
upon
making
you
my
wife
miss
leslie
leslie
face
flushed
and
she
made
a
motion
as
if
to
get
up
but
sank
back
again
with
a
faint
sigh
of
resignation
that
been
my
keenest
wish
and
desire
since
i
saw
you
two
years
ago
and
it
just
as
keen
no
less
and
no
more
as
it
was
the
first
half
hour
i
spent
in
your
society
you
you
told
me
this
before
duncombe
said
leslie
not
angrily
nor
impatiently
but
very
softly
i
know
he
assented
and
you
told
me
that
it
could
be
and
i
suppose
most
men
would
have
been
satisfied
or
dissatisfied
and
given
it
up
but
i
not
made
like
that
i
should
be
where
i
am
and
what
i
am
if
i
were
i
dare
say
you
think
i
obstinate
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
played
on
leslie
lips
yes
she
said
but
but
may
i
not
be
obstinate
too
pleadingly
no
he
said
gravely
you
are
a
woman
a
girl
little
more
than
a
child
and
i
a
man
a
man
who
has
fought
his
way
in
the
world
and
knows
what
it
is
and
that
makes
it
different
but
wait
a
minute
he
said
you
said
because
well
because
i
not
because
i
have
the
taking
way
with
me
which
some
men
have
in
short
because
there
nothing
about
me
that
would
be
likely
to
take
a
romantic
girl
fancy
leslie
laughed
softly
who
told
you
that
i
am
romantic
mr
duncombe
she
said
all
girls
young
girls
who
do
know
the
world
are
romantic
he
said
as
if
he
were
remarking
that
the
world
is
round
and
that
two
and
two
make
four
you
look
at
the
outside
of
things
and
because
i
not
handsome
and
a
swell
you
think
you
could
bring
yourself
to
love
me
and
that
i
not
worth
loving
leslie
shook
her
head
i
respect
you
very
much
i
like
you
duncombe
she
said
in
a
low
voice
very
well
that
all
i
ask
he
retorted
promptly
be
my
wife
and
i
change
your
respect
into
liking
your
liking
into
love
satisfied
with
that
when
a
man
starving
he
is
thankful
for
half
a
loaf
he
did
plead
his
cause
at
all
badly
and
leslie
gray
eyes
melted
and
grew
moist
do
shake
your
head
he
said
just
listen
to
me
first
you
know
i
love
you
you
ca
doubt
that
if
you
did
and
you
knew
what
given
up
to
come
down
here
you
would
doubt
any
longer
and
you
would
if
you
knew
what
this
love
of
mine
costs
me
a
business
man
wants
all
his
wits
about
him
if
he
means
to
succeed
he
wants
all
his
thoughts
and
energies
for
his
business
and
for
the
last
two
years
my
wits
and
my
thoughts
have
been
wandering
after
you
it
a
wonder
that
i
have
succeeded
but
i
have
miss
leslie
though
i
plain
to
look
at
i
believe
i
got
brains
if
i
ca
offer
you
a
title
leslie
smiled
it
was
so
likely
that
anyone
would
offer
her
a
title
i
can
at
least
make
you
a
rich
woman
her
face
flushed
mr
duncombe
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
all
girls
declare
that
they
care
for
money
and
they
mean
it
but
that
nonsense
a
beautiful
woman
beautiful
whether
she
poor
or
rich
but
she
more
likely
to
be
happy
with
plenty
of
money
and
you
shall
have
plenty
i
am
a
rich
man
now
as
times
go
and
i
mean
to
be
richer
i
been
working
these
two
years
with
one
object
before
me
i
made
the
money
solely
that
i
might
become
less
unworthy
to
offer
myself
miss
leslie
my
heart
is
yours
already
such
as
it
is
be
my
wife
and
share
my
home
and
fortune
with
me
leslie
lips
trembled
oh
if
i
could
she
murmured
almost
inaudibly
i
am
so
sorry
so
sorry
he
took
up
a
pebble
looked
hard
at
it
and
cast
it
from
him
you
mean
that
you
ca
love
me
he
said
rather
hoarsely
her
silence
gave
assent
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
expected
you
to
say
that
but
i
thought
i
should
persuade
you
to
try
and
trust
yourself
to
me
and
wait
for
the
love
to
come
he
paused
a
moment
miss
leslie
do
you
ever
think
of
the
future
of
the
future
she
turned
her
startled
eyes
on
his
face
grave
almost
to
sternness
yes
forgive
me
if
i
speak
plainly
you
and
your
father
are
alone
in
the
world
yes
ah
yes
dropped
from
her
parted
lips
and
he
well
even
now
it
is
you
who
are
the
protector
some
day
leslie
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
think
of
you
alone
in
the
world
alone
and
poor
i
know
that
the
little
he
has
goes
with
him
be
angry
i
am
thinking
only
of
you
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
you
and
your
future
if
you
would
say
if
you
would
promise
to
be
my
wife
not
only
would
your
future
be
secure
but
your
present
his
present
would
be
easier
happier
for
your
father
sake
if
not
for
your
own
he
stopped
for
leslie
had
risen
and
stood
looking
down
at
him
her
lips
quivering
her
hands
clasped
tightly
no
no
she
panted
not
even
for
for
his
sake
oh
i
could
not
i
could
not
he
arose
his
face
was
pale
making
his
red
hair
more
scarlet
by
contrast
i
understand
he
said
it
is
that
you
do
not
love
me
but
that
you
well
yes
dislike
me
no
yes
that
it
he
said
his
eyes
resting
for
a
moment
on
the
lovely
face
with
the
wistful
hungry
half
fierce
look
of
a
famishing
man
denied
the
crust
which
might
save
his
life
then
his
eyes
sank
to
the
stones
i
see
now
that
i
have
been
a
fool
to
go
on
hoping
that
my
case
is
hopeless
do
for
she
had
shrunk
from
his
almost
savage
tone
do
be
afraid
i
am
not
going
to
bother
you
any
more
i
wish
i
could
say
that
i
am
going
to
give
up
loving
you
but
i
ca
do
that
something
tells
me
he
struck
his
breast
as
if
he
were
glad
of
something
to
strike
that
i
shall
go
on
loving
you
till
i
die
see
here
les
miss
lisle
it
evident
that
i
ca
be
your
husband
but
i
can
be
your
friend
no
for
she
turned
her
head
away
no
i
mean
that
i
am
going
to
hang
about
you
and
pester
you
i
could
the
sight
of
you
would
be
torture
to
me
i
hope
yes
i
hope
i
see
you
for
years
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
that
if
ever
you
need
a
friend
remember
that
there
is
one
man
in
the
world
who
would
give
his
right
hand
to
serve
you
remember
that
at
any
time
any
time
in
one
year
two
or
when
you
are
old
and
gray
that
you
have
only
to
say
to
bring
me
like
a
faithful
dog
to
your
feet
that
time
will
never
come
you
think
very
good
but
still
you
may
need
me
if
you
do
send
to
me
i
devote
my
life
to
you
oh
there
no
merit
in
it
i
ca
help
it
i
romantic
in
a
way
you
see
he
smiled
with
bitter
for
his
weakness
you
are
the
one
woman
in
the
world
to
me
your
case
is
mine
your
friends
shall
be
mine
your
foes
mine
if
you
need
a
protector
send
for
me
if
one
wrongs
you
and
you
want
revenge
send
to
me
and
as
there
is
a
heaven
above
us
i
will
come
at
your
call
to
help
to
avenge
you
his
face
was
white
his
eyes
gleaming
under
their
red
brows
so
transformed
was
he
by
the
master
passion
that
if
any
one
of
his
city
friends
had
seen
him
at
that
moment
they
would
scarcely
have
recognized
him
ralph
duncombe
talking
the
rant
of
melodrama
impossible
leslie
drew
back
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
in
a
fascinated
kind
of
gaze
her
bosom
heaving
he
made
an
evident
effort
to
regain
his
and
succeeded
with
a
long
breath
he
allowed
his
face
to
regain
its
usual
hard
expression
i
have
frightened
you
he
said
still
rather
hoarsely
but
calmly
forgive
me
i
told
you
how
i
loved
you
and
you
see
a
man
does
tear
from
his
heart
the
hope
that
has
grown
there
for
two
years
without
feeling
it
i
am
going
now
you
can
make
any
excuse
to
your
father
or
you
need
not
tell
him
you
have
seen
me
leslie
it
the
last
time
i
shall
call
you
so
he
held
out
his
hand
it
was
firm
as
a
rock
and
gripped
hers
so
tightly
that
she
winced
i
hurt
you
he
said
i
who
would
lay
down
my
life
to
save
you
a
moment
pain
he
looked
at
his
hand
it
was
my
ring
ah
he
exclaimed
as
if
an
idea
had
occurred
to
him
and
he
drew
the
ring
from
his
finger
take
this
he
said
and
he
took
her
hand
opened
it
and
placing
the
ring
on
her
palm
closed
her
fingers
over
it
gently
and
yet
firmly
as
if
he
would
accept
no
refusal
if
ever
you
need
a
friend
either
for
yourself
or
another
if
ever
you
need
to
be
avenged
on
a
foe
send
this
ring
to
me
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
send
a
word
with
it
and
i
will
come
to
you
he
raised
her
hand
toward
his
lips
then
with
a
sound
that
was
half
sigh
half
groan
he
let
it
fall
and
without
looking
round
climbed
the
beach
and
was
lost
to
sight
chapter
iv
the
new
duke
the
expression
on
yorke
auchester
face
as
his
cousin
introduced
him
as
his
grace
the
duke
of
rothbury
beggars
description
he
stared
at
the
duke
and
colored
with
a
mixture
of
amazement
and
annoyance
which
caused
the
duke
to
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
laugh
he
did
not
often
laugh
that
was
neatly
done
yorke
he
said
it
is
often
a
man
is
made
a
duke
so
easily
said
yorke
but
but
it
rather
a
large
order
dolph
and
he
turned
to
the
window
with
something
like
a
frown
on
his
handsome
face
not
at
all
said
the
duke
cheerfully
and
airily
you
will
find
it
easy
and
natural
enough
after
the
first
half
hour
there
is
very
little
difference
between
the
duke
and
the
dustman
nowadays
indeed
if
the
dustman
can
only
talk
and
manage
to
get
into
parliament
he
is
often
a
greater
man
than
the
duke
and
he
is
quite
certain
to
put
on
more
come
yorke
you
are
not
angry
no
no
responded
yorke
auchester
rather
surprised
that
all
my
elevation
is
somewhat
sudden
you
see
and
he
laughed
the
whim
seems
to
give
you
pleasure
and
it
wo
hurt
me
and
it
wo
last
long
you
only
want
me
to
take
your
place
while
you
are
down
here
just
so
said
the
duke
i
afraid
you
could
manage
it
in
london
poor
cripple
rothbury
is
too
well
known
there
seriously
my
dear
yorke
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
you
have
made
it
possible
for
me
to
enjoy
a
few
weeks
of
quiet
and
repose
these
simple
folk
wo
take
any
notice
after
the
first
day
or
two
of
a
hunchback
who
is
only
a
common
let
me
see
what
shall
i
call
myself
brown
jones
robinson
no
there
are
quite
enough
of
those
honored
names
in
the
directory
already
i
call
myself
temple
there
is
a
temple
in
the
family
nomenclature
yes
temple
there
is
no
fear
of
our
little
arrangement
becoming
known
i
not
one
of
those
men
who
delight
in
seeing
their
coat
of
arms
emblazoned
on
everything
they
wear
and
use
i
do
think
there
is
a
coronet
to
be
found
anywhere
about
me
and
grey
is
the
pink
and
pattern
of
discretion
you
can
wear
the
lion
skin
poor
lion
down
here
at
portmaris
in
perfect
security
be
a
good
duke
yorke
keep
up
the
honor
of
the
old
title
he
laughed
again
at
any
rate
you
will
look
every
inch
of
one
and
now
about
that
money
a
duke
must
have
the
means
of
keeping
up
his
state
you
know
will
you
hand
me
up
that
dispatch
box
or
shall
i
ring
for
grey
yorke
auchester
placed
the
writing
case
on
the
table
and
the
duke
took
out
his
check
book
how
much
shall
it
be
yorke
he
asked
without
looking
up
and
with
a
certain
shyness
as
if
it
were
he
who
was
about
to
receive
the
money
instead
of
giving
it
yorke
auchester
looked
down
at
him
with
an
expression
on
his
face
which
made
it
nice
to
look
at
you
are
very
good
to
me
dolph
he
said
it
is
only
the
other
day
you
sent
me
sufficient
for
the
day
only
is
the
check
thereof
cut
in
the
duke
as
if
to
stop
any
thanks
i
dare
say
that
is
all
spent
it
is
indeed
assented
the
young
man
candidly
the
duke
laughed
easily
who
cares
not
you
who
i
dare
say
have
had
your
enjoyment
out
of
it
not
i
who
have
more
money
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
how
much
shall
we
say
a
thousand
yorke
yorke
auchester
face
flushed
i
should
like
to
say
it
is
too
much
he
said
but
you
believe
me
if
i
did
dolph
the
duke
smiled
i
certainly
should
not
i
can
guess
how
quickly
money
flies
when
one
is
young
and
strong
blessed
with
youth
appetite
for
pleasure
he
filled
in
the
check
in
a
sharp
pointed
hand
and
gave
it
to
his
cousin
there
you
are
you
must
spend
some
of
it
down
here
for
the
honor
of
the
name
yorke
laughed
all
right
he
said
though
i
do
quite
know
what
i
can
buy
sixpence
in
periwinkles
would
go
a
long
way
yes
said
the
duke
that
is
what
i
find
money
is
a
burden
and
a
nuisance
if
you
do
know
how
to
get
rid
of
it
suppose
you
buy
half
a
crown
worth
of
winkles
and
a
lobster
or
two
when
grey
came
in
with
the
lunch
he
was
surprised
to
find
his
master
in
so
bright
a
humor
you
quite
understand
the
arrangement
between
lord
auchester
and
me
grey
said
the
duke
yes
your
gra
sir
the
duke
smiled
my
name
is
temple
grey
he
said
this
gentleman
is
the
duke
of
rothbury
do
forget
that
and
do
by
a
slip
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
i
want
to
be
quiet
and
to
avoid
the
worry
of
being
called
upon
and
stared
at
while
i
am
down
here
you
sure
you
understand
grey
quite
sir
oh
quite
said
grey
who
was
an
admirable
servant
and
in
addition
to
being
as
the
duke
had
said
the
pink
and
pattern
of
discretion
had
lived
long
enough
with
his
grace
to
know
him
thoroughly
and
to
appreciate
a
good
master
who
with
all
his
whims
and
fads
was
tenderness
and
liberality
personified
of
course
you
do
said
the
duke
you
must
be
as
glad
of
a
little
quiet
as
i
can
be
and
we
shall
get
it
down
here
under
this
arrangement
now
mind
be
careful
and
keep
the
secret
have
you
brought
up
my
beef
tea
very
well
you
need
not
wait
grey
wheeled
his
master
to
the
table
cast
a
glance
of
respectful
astonishment
at
lord
auchester
which
meant
you
and
i
must
humor
him
of
course
my
lord
and
left
the
room
a
nice
lunch
is
it
yorke
said
the
duke
looking
round
the
table
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
it
you
are
nearly
always
hungry
you
and
he
sighed
as
he
smiled
quite
always
assented
yorke
auchester
chops
soles
and
a
custard
pudding
right
sure
you
wo
have
any
dolph
the
duke
shook
his
head
this
is
as
much
as
i
can
digest
he
said
tapping
the
basin
before
him
indifferently
now
tell
me
the
news
yorke
your
grace
yorke
laughed
news
i
do
think
there
any
you
do
know
not
london
news
i
dare
say
said
the
duke
though
i
do
know
much
of
that
i
do
go
out
more
often
than
i
am
obliged
to
i
do
dance
you
see
he
smiled
and
if
i
go
to
the
theater
i
find
that
i
distract
the
attention
of
the
audience
from
what
is
going
on
upon
the
stage
i
suppose
they
consider
me
as
interesting
as
good
if
not
better
than
any
play
and
as
to
plays
there
are
many
good
ones
now
the
last
time
i
went
was
to
that
burlesque
at
the
diadem
theater
and
everybody
seemed
as
you
call
it
on
that
dancer
what
her
name
eh
yorke
auchester
was
in
the
act
of
disboning
his
second
sole
he
stopped
and
looked
up
paused
for
a
moment
with
a
rather
singular
expression
on
his
frank
handsome
face
finetta
do
you
mean
he
said
slowly
yes
that
the
name
i
think
said
the
duke
stirring
his
beef
tea
as
if
he
hated
it
so
called
i
suppose
because
she
has
finished
so
many
good
men
and
true
they
tell
me
that
she
has
completely
ruined
poor
charlie
farquhar
is
that
so
yorke
yorke
seemed
very
much
ingrossed
in
his
sole
oh
farquhar
he
said
yes
he
is
but
i
do
know
that
fin
i
mean
finetta
has
had
so
much
to
do
with
it
charlie
was
under
the
delusion
that
he
understood
horses
and
i
see
said
the
duke
poor
lad
i
suppose
if
i
offered
to
help
him
he
would
be
quite
offended
i
do
know
you
might
try
said
yorke
dryly
i
see
but
about
this
same
finetta
she
was
pretty
yorke
auchester
looked
up
with
a
laugh
it
was
not
a
particularly
merry
one
only
pretty
well
yes
to
my
eyes
but
i
rather
particular
and
hard
to
please
i
admit
oh
yes
she
was
pretty
and
she
danced
he
smiled
yes
she
danced
without
doubt
the
young
men
in
the
stalls
seemed
infatuated
but
i
did
fall
down
and
worship
with
the
rest
perhaps
i
though
i
not
much
more
than
your
age
anyhow
a
very
little
of
mlle
finetta
goes
a
long
way
with
me
do
you
know
her
yorke
oh
everybody
knows
finetta
replied
yorke
auchester
carelessly
a
little
too
carelessly
and
some
it
seems
like
poor
charlie
farquhar
know
her
not
wisely
but
too
well
well
i
not
been
to
the
theater
since
and
that
six
weeks
ago
is
that
chop
tender
first
rate
try
it
i
dare
not
but
i
enjoy
seeing
you
eat
it
i
often
had
thoughts
of
having
a
man
with
a
good
appetite
that
i
might
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
eat
a
square
meal
while
i
sit
cursing
my
beef
tea
and
gruel
the
night
i
went
to
the
diadem
i
took
eleanor
yorke
auchester
suspended
his
fork
half
way
to
his
mouth
and
looked
at
his
cousin
oh
he
said
and
whatever
the
oh
might
have
been
intended
to
mean
it
was
singularly
dull
and
inexpressive
yes
it
was
her
birthday
and
she
asked
me
to
take
her
that
was
kind
of
her
was
it
was
it
said
yorke
dryly
well
i
think
so
you
mean
that
most
young
girls
would
like
to
go
to
the
theater
with
the
duke
of
rothbury
or
for
the
matter
of
that
any
other
duke
unmarried
but
that
because
they
would
go
with
the
hope
of
repeating
the
visit
some
day
as
his
duchess
but
eleanor
knows
that
i
should
not
marry
her
we
have
come
to
a
plain
understanding
on
the
subject
i
see
said
yorke
auchester
i
suppose
this
is
dartmoor
mutton
very
good
i
dare
say
assented
the
duke
with
a
smile
but
to
return
to
mutton
which
is
eleanor
it
was
her
birthday
and
i
took
her
to
the
theater
and
gave
her
a
small
present
the
rothbury
pearls
some
persons
would
call
an
elephant
small
remarked
yorke
laconically
did
did
you
give
her
anything
yorke
asked
the
duke
almost
shyly
ignoring
the
comments
yorke
auchester
took
a
draught
of
the
admirable
claret
which
grey
had
brought
down
with
him
before
replying
i
he
said
carelessly
no
why
should
i
what
would
be
the
use
she
does
expect
anything
better
than
a
penwiper
or
a
shilling
prayer
book
from
a
pauper
like
me
and
she
has
tin
enough
to
buy
a
million
of
if
she
wants
them
and
he
attacked
the
custard
the
duke
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
handsome
face
of
his
cousin
with
its
frank
and
free
and
happily
expression
i
a
notion
that
eleanor
would
value
anything
in
the
way
of
a
penwiper
or
a
prayer
book
you
might
give
her
yorke
he
said
not
she
it
only
your
fancy
i
think
not
said
the
duke
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
thoughtfully
and
gravely
at
the
risk
of
repeating
myself
i
will
say
once
more
that
it
is
a
pity
you
are
not
the
duke
of
rothbury
yorke
thanks
but
a
better
man
got
the
berth
you
see
and
a
still
greater
pity
that
you
ca
be
the
future
one
but
you
ca
can
you
yorke
not
while
uncle
eustace
and
his
two
boys
come
before
me
and
as
they
are
all
as
healthy
as
plowboys
and
likely
to
live
to
the
eighties
every
one
of
there
does
seem
much
chance
dolph
no
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
it
rather
hard
on
the
british
peerage
that
the
present
duke
of
rothbury
should
be
a
hunchback
and
a
cripple
and
that
the
next
should
be
a
miser
while
the
young
man
who
would
adorn
the
title
should
be
a
penniless
young
scamp
put
in
yorke
lightly
the
duke
colored
well
barring
the
scamp
that
was
in
my
thoughts
do
you
ever
think
of
the
future
yorke
never
if
i
can
help
it
responded
the
young
fellow
cutting
himself
a
piece
of
stilton
the
duke
smiled
but
rather
gravely
i
do
and
when
i
think
of
it
i
wish
that
i
could
secure
it
for
you
but
you
know
that
i
ca
yorke
every
penny
or
nearly
every
penny
goes
to
lord
eustace
do
let
it
trouble
you
dolph
said
yorke
auchester
of
course
the
money
must
go
to
keep
up
the
title
every
fellow
understands
that
heaven
knows
i
had
enough
as
it
is
and
so
you
did
give
eleanor
a
birthday
present
said
the
duke
slowly
that
was
to
put
it
delicately
yorke
thoughtless
of
you
will
you
give
me
that
box
the
leather
one
thanks
he
opened
the
box
and
took
out
a
small
morocco
case
and
tossed
it
across
the
table
i
had
an
idea
you
would
forget
it
and
so
by
jove
that
pretty
broke
in
yorke
he
had
opened
the
case
and
revealed
a
gold
bracelet
not
set
with
diamonds
but
of
plain
though
workmanship
just
the
sort
of
gift
which
a
rather
poor
young
man
could
manage
i
glad
you
like
it
i
am
sure
eleanor
will
especially
as
it
comes
from
you
yorke
auchester
colored
and
he
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
about
to
decline
the
piece
of
jewelry
but
checking
the
words
that
rose
to
his
lips
he
put
the
case
in
his
pocket
it
a
shame
to
let
her
think
it
came
from
me
but
i
give
it
to
her
because
he
paused
because
you
are
too
to
disoblige
me
said
the
duke
she
think
i
been
committing
burglary
in
that
case
she
will
value
the
thing
all
the
more
highly
retorted
the
duke
he
leaned
back
and
rested
his
head
on
his
hand
go
out
and
smoke
yorke
he
said
presently
yorke
auchester
was
accustomed
to
his
cousin
peremptory
words
they
were
just
those
of
a
sick
man
and
had
nothing
of
discourtesy
in
them
all
right
he
said
i
stroll
down
to
the
parade
the
duke
smiled
i
expect
you
will
find
nothing
but
a
strip
of
beach
he
said
there
are
some
cigars
in
that
traveling
case
but
yorke
said
he
had
some
cigars
and
tossing
on
his
hat
made
his
way
out
into
the
sunshine
for
the
first
few
minutes
as
he
went
down
the
village
street
and
along
the
narrow
quay
which
stood
for
parade
his
face
was
unusually
grave
and
thoughtful
we
suppose
by
this
time
the
intelligent
reader
will
have
formed
some
opinion
respecting
yorke
auchester
at
any
rate
we
are
not
going
to
try
and
persuade
the
reader
that
the
young
fellow
was
an
angel
he
was
no
worse
perhaps
a
shade
better
than
most
young
men
of
his
class
he
was
idle
but
then
he
had
never
been
taught
to
work
though
in
the
way
of
sport
he
would
cheerfully
undergo
any
amount
of
toil
and
endure
any
amount
of
hardship
he
was
thoughtless
because
he
had
nothing
to
think
about
except
the
ever
recurring
problem
how
best
to
kill
time
he
was
extravagant
because
never
having
earned
money
he
had
no
idea
of
its
value
but
he
would
share
his
last
note
with
a
friend
would
sit
up
beside
that
friend
all
night
and
many
nights
if
he
happened
to
fall
sick
and
behind
his
manner
hid
a
heart
as
tender
as
a
woman
more
tender
than
most
women
perhaps
and
like
the
antique
hero
feared
neither
man
nor
beast
children
and
dogs
loved
him
at
first
sight
but
alas
that
was
perchance
because
of
his
handsome
face
his
bright
smile
and
his
short
laugh
for
dogs
and
children
have
an
unfair
partiality
for
cheerful
and
people
and
too
often
unwisely
judge
by
appearances
anyhow
there
he
was
with
all
his
faults
and
so
we
have
got
to
take
him
he
created
quite
a
little
sensation
as
he
sauntered
along
with
his
hands
in
his
norfolk
jacket
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
his
big
in
his
mouth
the
simple
folk
of
portmaris
had
never
before
seen
anything
so
splendid
but
yorke
did
not
notice
them
he
was
thinking
wondering
what
his
cousin
the
duke
would
say
if
he
knew
how
far
too
well
he
yorke
knew
finetta
wondering
whether
he
better
cut
town
and
marry
eleanor
dallas
and
her
fifty
thousand
pounds
wondering
oh
dash
it
he
exclaimed
at
last
as
he
felt
the
crisp
check
in
his
pocket
what
the
use
of
bothering
on
such
a
morning
too
and
he
threw
off
the
pale
cast
of
thought
and
began
to
sing
under
his
breath
then
he
stopped
suddenly
for
he
saw
a
young
girl
sitting
on
the
shingle
with
her
back
to
the
breakwater
it
was
leslie
sitting
as
ralph
duncombe
had
left
her
she
held
the
ring
in
her
hand
her
bosom
still
heaving
her
heart
troubled
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
there
was
a
tear
trembling
on
the
long
black
lashes
and
a
faint
quiver
on
the
parted
lips
and
yorke
auchester
as
unseen
by
her
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
saw
this
now
one
of
this
young
man
foibles
was
the
desire
when
he
saw
people
in
distress
or
trouble
to
help
them
out
of
it
or
failing
to
do
that
to
at
any
rate
try
and
cheer
them
up
and
console
them
that
the
pretty
girl
from
over
the
way
he
mused
pretty
a
lovely
face
perfectly
lovely
now
what
the
matter
with
her
i
wonder
she
ca
be
up
to
her
neck
in
debt
and
and
the
rest
of
it
got
into
a
scrape
i
expect
and
somebody
papa
or
mamma
i
suppose
has
been
bullying
her
i
should
think
whoever
they
are
they
must
find
it
difficult
to
worry
such
an
angel
as
that
she
been
crying
or
going
to
cry
now
what
an
ass
of
a
world
this
is
if
i
were
to
go
down
to
her
and
ask
her
what
was
the
matter
and
try
and
cheer
her
up
and
tell
her
there
was
anything
in
the
universe
worth
crying
for
she
jump
up
like
a
young
feel
herself
insulted
scream
for
her
brother
or
her
father
and
there
be
a
row
and
yet
where
would
be
the
harm
i
know
this
that
if
i
were
sitting
there
down
on
my
luck
i
should
like
her
to
come
and
console
me
but
that
different
i
suppose
well
as
the
man
said
when
his
tumbled
out
of
the
second
floor
window
it
no
business
of
mine
but
though
he
made
this
philosophical
reflection
he
still
stood
and
looked
at
her
wistfully
until
afraid
that
she
might
turn
her
head
and
see
him
he
went
down
the
beach
and
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
breakwater
leslie
did
not
hear
him
was
quite
unconscious
of
his
proximity
did
not
even
notice
the
perfume
of
the
choice
havana
what
was
troubling
her
was
the
memory
of
ralph
duncombe
passionate
words
and
melodramatic
promise
and
the
question
what
should
she
do
with
the
ring
she
would
have
died
rather
than
have
put
it
on
her
finger
she
did
like
though
she
wanted
to
pitch
it
in
the
sea
so
she
still
held
it
in
her
soft
hot
little
palm
happy
ring
so
these
two
sat
presently
that
peculiar
desire
which
assails
everybody
who
sits
on
the
beach
at
the
began
to
assail
yorke
why
it
should
be
so
difficult
to
refrain
from
flinging
stones
into
the
sea
it
is
impossible
to
say
the
clever
people
have
found
out
most
things
or
say
they
have
but
this
still
beats
them
yorke
like
everybody
else
found
the
desire
irresistible
half
unconsciously
he
took
up
a
stone
and
shied
it
at
the
end
pile
of
the
breakwater
he
missed
it
mechanically
took
another
aim
and
hit
it
then
he
absently
found
a
piece
of
wood
the
fragment
of
some
wreck
which
had
gone
down
outside
in
the
bay
perhaps
and
threw
that
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
sullen
angry
waves
which
rolled
and
showed
their
teeth
along
the
sand
a
minute
perhaps
two
afterward
he
heard
a
cry
of
distress
behind
him
and
looking
round
saw
leslie
standing
and
gazing
seaward
with
a
troubled
anxious
look
in
her
gray
eyes
yorke
was
astounded
what
on
earth
had
happened
had
she
caught
sight
of
a
vessel
going
down
a
boat
upset
what
she
began
to
run
down
the
beach
her
small
feet
touching
the
big
bowlders
with
the
lightness
and
confidence
of
familiarity
and
once
more
she
cried
out
in
distress
yorke
strode
after
her
and
gained
her
side
what
the
matter
he
shouted
above
the
dull
sea
roar
she
turned
her
face
to
him
with
a
piteous
look
of
entreaty
and
alarm
dick
it
dick
she
said
dick
who
which
where
he
demanded
looking
in
the
direction
of
her
eyes
it
a
little
dog
there
she
answered
quickly
and
pointing
a
little
black
and
tan
do
you
see
him
ah
he
is
so
small
i
see
him
said
yorke
what
he
doing
out
there
and
ca
he
swim
yes
oh
yes
but
the
tide
is
going
out
and
he
has
got
too
far
and
the
current
is
dreadfully
strong
oh
poor
poor
dick
he
went
out
after
a
piece
of
wood
or
something
that
some
one
threw
yorke
flushed
he
felt
as
guilty
and
uncomfortable
as
if
he
had
been
detected
in
an
act
of
killing
a
human
being
see
he
can
not
make
any
way
oh
poor
little
dick
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
so
fond
of
him
and
he
is
such
a
nice
she
stopped
and
turned
her
head
away
as
if
she
could
not
go
on
and
could
look
no
longer
i
threw
the
piece
of
wood
said
yorke
i
did
see
the
dog
he
so
small
oh
for
goodness
sake
do
cry
it
all
right
he
got
out
of
his
coat
with
the
cool
quickness
of
a
man
who
is
used
to
emergencies
in
the
sporting
way
and
running
across
the
sand
sprang
into
the
sea
and
struck
out
leslie
was
too
astonished
for
a
moment
to
realize
what
he
had
done
then
she
raised
her
voice
with
a
warning
cry
the
current
she
called
to
him
the
current
oh
come
back
please
come
back
chapter
appreciated
genius
yorke
soon
found
himself
out
of
his
depth
and
almost
as
quickly
discovered
what
the
young
lady
meant
by
shouting
the
current
but
he
was
a
good
swimmer
there
was
scarcely
anything
yorke
auchester
could
not
do
except
earn
his
living
and
though
he
found
his
boots
and
clothes
very
much
in
the
way
he
got
through
the
waves
at
a
fair
pace
and
reached
the
black
and
tan
saving
a
fellow
creature
is
hard
work
enough
but
it
is
almost
as
bad
to
rescue
a
dog
even
so
small
a
one
as
dick
from
a
watery
grave
when
yorke
had
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
him
with
one
hand
dick
commenced
to
scratch
and
claw
no
doubt
under
the
impression
that
the
great
big
man
had
come
to
hasten
his
death
rather
than
prevent
it
and
yorke
was
compelled
to
swim
on
his
back
and
hold
the
clawing
struggling
little
terrier
pressed
hard
against
his
chest
it
was
hard
work
getting
back
but
he
found
himself
touching
the
sand
at
last
and
scrambling
to
his
feet
waded
through
what
remained
of
the
water
and
set
dick
upon
his
four
legs
at
leslie
feet
of
course
the
little
imp
after
shaking
the
water
off
his
diminutive
carcase
barked
furiously
at
his
preserver
now
the
handsomest
man
and
for
that
matter
the
prettiest
woman
also
is
not
improved
in
appearance
by
a
bath
that
is
before
he
has
dried
himself
and
brushed
his
hair
the
salt
water
was
running
off
yorke
tall
figure
at
all
points
his
short
hair
was
stuck
to
his
forehead
his
mustache
drooped
his
eyes
were
blinking
and
his
clothes
adhered
to
him
as
if
they
loved
him
better
than
a
brother
he
did
look
in
the
least
heroic
but
extremely
comical
and
leslie
first
impulse
was
to
laugh
but
the
laugh
did
not
indeed
would
not
come
and
she
picked
up
the
damp
dick
and
hugged
him
and
looked
over
his
still
snarling
countenance
at
his
preserver
with
a
sudden
shyness
in
her
eyes
and
a
heightened
color
in
her
face
she
looked
so
supremely
lovely
as
she
stood
thus
that
yorke
forgot
his
sensation
of
stickiness
and
gazed
at
her
with
a
sudden
thrill
agitating
his
heart
leslie
found
her
voice
at
last
but
there
only
came
softly
slowly
the
commonplace
thank
you
it
sounded
so
terribly
commonplace
and
insufficient
that
she
made
an
effort
and
added
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
how
wet
you
must
be
you
must
not
stand
about
yorke
smiled
and
knocked
the
hair
from
his
forehead
and
wrung
his
shirt
sleeves
it
all
right
he
said
it
was
my
fault
if
i
had
chucked
the
piece
of
wood
he
would
have
gone
in
he
has
come
to
any
harm
apparently
oh
no
no
he
all
right
said
leslie
he
can
swim
very
well
when
the
tide
is
coming
in
but
when
it
is
going
out
it
is
too
strong
for
him
and
he
would
have
been
drowned
if
you
had
not
gone
after
him
and
her
eyes
dropped
poor
little
chap
said
yorke
putting
on
his
coat
that
would
never
have
done
would
it
doggie
it
is
a
very
dangerous
place
for
bathing
said
leslie
the
current
is
very
strong
and
that
is
why
i
called
out
yes
thanks
he
said
to
spare
her
the
embarrassment
of
explaining
that
sudden
frightened
cry
of
hers
i
could
feel
that
but
i
have
to
thank
dick
for
an
enjoyable
bath
all
the
same
i
suppose
he
will
never
forgive
me
the
person
whose
life
you
save
never
does
he
sat
down
on
the
breakwater
and
began
to
empty
his
pockets
there
were
several
papers
bills
reduced
to
yorke
did
not
sorrow
over
them
his
watch
had
stopped
his
cigars
and
cigar
case
were
irretrievably
ruined
he
held
them
up
with
a
laugh
and
laid
them
on
top
of
the
breakwater
in
the
sun
then
suddenly
his
expression
grew
rather
grave
as
he
took
up
an
envelope
and
looked
at
it
by
george
he
said
all
the
rest
does
matter
but
this
belong
to
me
leslie
stood
and
looked
down
at
him
anxiously
she
was
thinking
of
colds
and
rheumatism
while
the
young
fellow
sat
so
perfectly
contented
in
his
wet
clothes
do
you
think
had
you
not
better
go
home
and
change
your
things
as
quickly
as
possible
she
said
forgetting
her
shyness
in
her
anxiety
he
looked
up
from
the
envelope
why
i
shall
be
dry
in
ten
minutes
he
said
carelessly
and
i
take
any
harm
if
i
not
i
never
caught
cold
in
my
life
besides
salt
water
never
hurts
leslie
shook
her
head
gravely
i
do
believe
that
it
a
fallacy
she
said
some
of
the
old
fishermen
here
suffer
terribly
from
rheumatism
that
because
they
old
you
see
he
said
smiling
up
at
her
and
if
you
think
it
so
dangerous
had
you
better
put
master
dick
down
he
is
making
you
awfully
wet
she
shook
her
head
and
held
dick
all
the
more
tightly
i
am
so
glad
to
get
him
back
she
said
half
to
herself
that
i
do
mind
his
making
me
a
little
damp
but
i
do
wish
you
would
go
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
but
after
another
glance
at
the
letter
said
i
picked
this
up
just
over
there
and
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
cliffs
and
i
should
like
to
find
its
owner
though
i
expect
she
wo
thank
me
much
when
she
sees
its
condition
have
you
been
here
long
do
you
know
the
people
here
pretty
well
we
have
been
here
some
months
said
leslie
and
yes
i
think
i
know
them
all
now
who
does
she
mean
by
her
husband
yorke
asked
himself
and
an
uncomfortable
little
pain
shot
through
him
no
he
assured
himself
she
ca
be
married
too
young
and
too
happy
looking
well
then
perhaps
you
know
a
young
lady
by
the
name
of
lisle
leslie
lisle
he
said
leslie
smiled
that
is
my
name
it
is
i
she
replied
by
george
he
exclaimed
then
this
is
your
property
and
he
held
out
the
letter
leslie
took
it
and
as
she
looked
at
the
address
flushed
hotly
it
was
ralph
duncombe
missing
letter
yorke
noticed
the
flush
and
he
looked
aside
my
father
dropped
it
she
said
with
an
embarrassment
which
slight
as
it
was
did
not
escape
him
thank
you
i
sorry
that
i
did
put
it
in
my
coat
pocket
instead
of
my
waistcoat
he
said
but
i
knew
if
i
did
that
i
should
forget
it
perhaps
for
weeks
i
always
forget
letters
that
fellows
ask
me
to
post
so
i
put
it
in
with
my
watch
that
i
might
come
across
it
when
i
looked
at
the
time
and
so
it
got
wet
but
as
it
was
opened
you
have
read
it
so
that
i
hope
it
does
matter
so
much
no
i
have
read
it
papa
always
opens
my
letters
he
does
notice
the
difference
it
does
not
matter
in
the
least
i
know
what
was
in
it
thank
you
she
said
hurriedly
i
wish
some
one
would
always
open
and
read
my
letters
and
answer
them
too
said
yorke
devoutly
as
he
thought
of
the
great
pile
of
bills
which
awaited
him
every
morning
at
breakfast
are
you
staying
i
mean
lodging
visiting
here
miss
lisle
he
asked
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
that
would
keep
her
by
his
side
for
at
least
a
few
minutes
longer
yes
said
leslie
we
are
staying
in
street
as
it
is
called
at
sea
view
yorke
was
just
about
to
remark
i
know
but
checked
himself
and
said
instead
it
is
a
very
pretty
place
is
it
very
assented
leslie
and
quiet
there
is
no
prettier
place
on
the
coast
than
portmaris
so
i
should
think
he
said
looking
round
then
returning
to
the
beautiful
face
i
am
a
stranger
and
only
arrived
an
hour
or
two
ago
he
looked
down
trying
to
think
of
something
else
to
say
anything
that
would
keep
her
but
could
think
of
nothing
leslie
stood
for
a
moment
silent
too
then
she
said
will
you
not
go
and
change
your
things
now
dick
would
be
very
sorry
if
you
were
to
catch
cold
on
his
account
it
was
on
the
tip
of
yorke
tongue
to
ask
only
dick
but
once
more
he
checked
himself
the
retort
would
have
come
naturally
enough
if
he
had
been
addressing
a
london
belle
but
there
was
something
in
the
beautiful
gray
eyes
an
indescribable
expression
of
maidenly
dignity
and
reserve
which
sweet
as
it
was
warned
him
that
such
conversational
small
change
would
not
be
acceptable
to
miss
lisle
so
instead
he
said
with
a
smile
oh
dick
wo
mind
besides
he
knows
i
am
almost
as
dry
as
he
is
by
this
time
leslie
shook
her
head
as
if
in
contradiction
of
his
assertion
and
with
dick
still
pressed
to
her
bosom
said
and
and
thank
you
very
much
she
added
with
a
faint
color
coming
into
her
face
yorke
arose
raised
his
hat
and
watched
her
graceful
figure
as
it
lightly
stepped
up
the
beach
to
the
quay
then
he
collected
his
various
soaked
articles
from
the
breakwater
and
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
leslie
lisle
he
murmured
to
himself
the
name
music
and
she
apparently
he
could
not
hit
upon
any
set
of
terms
which
would
describe
her
even
to
his
own
mind
and
pressing
the
water
from
his
trousers
he
climbed
the
beach
still
looking
at
her
as
he
did
so
he
saw
a
tall
thin
gentleman
coming
toward
her
he
held
a
canvas
in
his
hands
gingerly
as
if
it
were
wet
and
was
followed
by
a
small
boy
carrying
a
portable
easel
and
other
artistic
impedimenta
and
as
leslie
spoke
to
the
artist
and
took
the
easel
from
the
boy
yorke
muttered
her
father
now
if
i
go
up
to
them
she
feel
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
tell
him
of
my
act
and
he
be
bored
to
death
trying
to
find
something
suitable
to
say
and
she
be
embarrassed
and
upset
and
hate
the
sight
of
me
she
looks
like
a
girl
who
ca
endure
a
fuss
no
i
go
round
the
other
way
if
there
is
another
way
as
the
cookery
books
say
he
looked
round
and
was
on
the
point
of
diving
into
a
narrow
street
opposite
him
when
an
invalid
chair
came
round
the
corner
driven
by
grey
and
the
occupant
whose
eyes
were
as
sharp
as
his
body
was
frail
and
crooked
caught
sight
of
the
stalwart
figure
and
held
up
a
hand
beckoningly
yorke
looked
very
much
as
if
he
meant
making
a
run
for
it
then
with
a
muttered
oh
confound
it
he
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
tried
to
look
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
sauntered
with
a
careless
leisurely
air
up
the
quay
by
this
time
francis
lisle
had
stuck
up
his
easel
right
in
the
center
of
the
narrow
pavement
and
arranged
his
canvas
and
grey
was
in
the
act
of
dragging
the
invalid
chair
round
it
when
leslie
bending
down
said
in
a
whisper
papa
i
must
move
the
easel
they
can
not
pass
eh
said
francis
lisle
looking
round
nervously
i
beg
your
pardon
i
will
move
yes
i
will
move
do
not
please
said
the
duke
his
thin
voice
softening
as
it
always
did
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
there
is
plenty
of
room
you
can
go
round
grey
yes
your
yes
sir
said
grey
his
master
shot
a
warning
glance
at
him
there
is
not
room
said
leslie
in
a
low
voice
but
the
duke
held
up
his
hand
please
do
not
trouble
he
said
i
am
not
going
any
further
i
only
want
to
speak
to
this
gentleman
coming
along
i
beg
you
will
not
trouble
to
move
the
easel
artists
must
not
be
disturbed
or
the
inspiration
may
desert
them
he
added
to
francis
lisle
with
a
pleasant
smile
thank
you
thank
you
said
lisle
still
clutching
the
easel
but
grey
had
turned
the
chair
with
its
front
to
the
sea
and
the
duke
called
to
yorke
who
had
come
upon
them
at
this
juncture
what
a
pretty
place
yorke
he
said
have
you
had
your
stroll
shall
we
go
back
yorke
had
discreetly
kept
behind
the
chair
and
out
of
sight
of
his
cousin
sharp
eyes
all
right
he
assented
will
you
give
me
a
cigar
said
the
duke
yorke
came
up
to
the
chair
and
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
thoughtlessly
extended
the
cigar
case
thanks
good
gracious
why
it
is
soaking
wet
hallo
yorke
and
the
duke
screwed
his
head
round
why
where
have
you
been
what
have
you
been
doing
yorke
flushed
and
cast
an
appealing
glance
at
leslie
downcast
face
to
be
made
the
center
of
an
astonished
and
absurdly
admiring
group
to
be
made
a
cheap
hero
of
was
more
than
he
could
stand
oh
it
nothing
he
growled
had
an
accident
tumbled
into
the
sea
an
accident
exclaimed
the
duke
staring
at
him
tumbled
in
the
sea
how
did
you
manage
that
in
the
name
of
goodness
yorke
got
red
and
looked
very
much
like
an
impatient
schoolboy
caught
playing
truant
or
breaking
windows
what
it
matter
he
said
fell
off
breakwater
go
and
get
the
cigars
grey
i
look
after
his
the
duke
cut
in
quickly
before
the
word
grace
nothing
of
the
sort
he
said
you
get
home
and
change
your
things
fell
off
the
breakwater
he
stared
at
him
incredulously
lisle
too
gazed
at
him
with
blank
astonishment
as
if
he
were
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
a
man
and
not
a
little
boy
in
knickerbockers
who
might
not
unnaturally
be
expected
to
tumble
off
the
breakwater
leslie
meanwhile
stood
with
downcast
eyes
then
suddenly
she
said
addressing
her
father
and
carefully
avoiding
the
other
two
this
gentleman
swam
in
to
save
dick
papa
that
is
why
he
is
wet
the
duke
scanned
her
face
keenly
and
smiled
curiously
that
sounds
more
probable
than
your
account
yorke
it
is
a
strange
thing
he
turned
his
head
to
lisle
that
a
man
is
more
often
ashamed
of
committing
a
good
or
generous
action
than
a
bad
one
how
do
you
account
for
it
lisle
looked
at
him
helplessly
as
if
he
had
been
asked
a
conundrum
which
no
one
could
be
expected
to
answer
because
there
is
always
such
a
thundering
fuss
about
it
said
yorke
stalking
off
the
duke
looked
after
him
for
a
minute
or
two
apparently
lost
in
thought
then
he
turned
to
lisle
again
you
are
an
artist
sir
he
said
lisle
flushed
i
am
at
least
an
humble
worshiper
at
the
throne
he
replied
in
the
low
nervous
voice
with
which
he
always
addressed
strangers
and
he
resumed
his
painting
the
duke
signed
to
grey
to
help
him
to
get
out
of
the
chair
which
was
so
placed
that
he
could
not
see
the
canvas
grey
came
round
and
in
opening
the
apron
let
the
duke
stick
fall
leslie
hesitated
a
moment
then
stepped
forward
and
picked
it
up
the
duke
took
it
from
her
with
a
faint
flush
on
his
pale
hollow
cheeks
thank
you
he
said
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
get
on
without
it
at
one
time
i
could
not
walk
even
with
its
aid
please
do
say
you
are
sorry
or
pity
me
he
added
with
an
air
of
levity
that
barely
concealed
his
sensitive
dread
of
any
expression
of
sympathy
everybody
says
that
you
know
i
was
not
going
to
say
so
said
leslie
looking
him
full
in
the
face
and
with
a
sweet
gentle
smile
he
looked
at
her
with
his
unnaturally
keen
eyes
no
he
said
quietly
i
do
think
you
were
and
this
is
the
picture
he
stopped
as
he
looked
at
the
awful
monstrosity
then
caught
leslie
eyes
gazing
at
him
with
anxious
pleading
deprecation
and
went
on
singular
effect
you
have
taken
great
pains
with
your
subject
mr
lisle
my
name
is
lisle
he
said
hurriedly
yes
yes
i
have
not
spared
pains
i
have
put
my
heart
into
my
work
that
is
quite
evident
said
the
duke
with
perfect
gravity
and
still
regarding
the
picture
and
that
which
a
man
puts
his
heart
in
will
reward
him
some
day
does
indeed
reward
him
even
while
he
works
true
true
assented
the
dreamer
with
a
gratified
glance
at
the
speaker
and
at
leslie
who
stood
with
downcast
eyes
to
which
the
brows
were
dangerously
near
it
is
with
that
hope
that
heart
that
we
artists
continue
to
labor
in
face
of
difficulties
which
to
the
careless
and
irreverent
seem
insurmountable
you
think
the
picture
a
a
good
one
sir
that
it
is
promising
the
duke
was
floored
for
a
moment
then
he
said
i
think
it
evidences
the
painter
love
for
his
art
and
his
complete
devotion
to
it
mr
lisle
the
poor
dreamer
face
had
fallen
during
the
pause
but
it
brightened
at
the
diplomatic
response
when
it
did
come
and
leslie
casting
a
grateful
glance
at
the
pale
face
of
the
cripple
murmured
in
his
ear
thank
you
the
duke
looked
at
her
with
a
glow
of
sympathy
in
his
eyes
this
is
your
daughter
i
presume
mr
lisle
he
said
lisle
nodded
yes
he
said
my
only
child
all
that
is
left
me
in
the
world
excepting
my
art
you
are
not
an
artist
also
sir
pardon
me
but
your
criticism
showed
such
discrimination
and
appreciation
that
i
was
led
to
conclude
you
might
be
a
the
duke
hesitated
a
moment
no
he
said
quietly
i
am
not
an
artist
though
i
am
fond
of
a
good
picture
poor
lisle
gazed
at
the
daub
and
nodded
with
a
gratified
smile
i
am
what
is
called
i
was
going
to
say
a
gentleman
at
ease
but
i
am
very
seldom
at
ease
my
name
is
temple
and
i
am
traveling
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
lisle
nodded
again
you
will
find
this
an
extremely
salubrious
spot
he
said
my
daughter
and
i
are
very
well
here
the
duke
glanced
at
leslie
tall
graceful
figure
and
smiled
grimly
but
then
she
is
not
a
cripple
he
said
a
cripple
lisle
looked
startled
and
bewildered
oh
no
oh
no
the
duke
smiled
and
leaning
upon
his
stick
seemed
to
be
watching
the
painter
at
his
work
but
his
eyes
wandered
now
and
again
covertly
to
the
beautiful
girl
beside
him
he
noticed
that
her
dress
though
admirably
fitting
was
by
no
means
new
or
of
costly
material
that
her
gloves
were
well
worn
and
carefully
mended
in
places
that
her
father
if
not
shabby
had
that
peculiar
look
about
his
clothes
which
tells
so
plainly
of
narrow
means
and
when
leslie
becoming
conscious
of
his
wandering
glance
moved
away
and
stood
at
a
little
distance
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
the
duke
said
have
you
disposed
of
your
picture
mr
lisle
francis
lisle
started
and
flushed
he
replied
that
is
not
yet
i
am
glad
of
that
said
the
duke
i
should
like
to
become
its
purchaser
if
you
are
disposed
to
sell
it
lisle
breath
came
fast
he
had
never
sold
a
picture
in
his
life
had
long
and
ardently
looked
forward
to
doing
so
and
and
oh
had
the
time
arrived
certainly
certainly
he
said
nervously
and
his
brush
shook
you
like
it
so
much
but
perhaps
you
would
like
some
others
of
mine
better
i
i
have
several
at
the
cottage
will
you
come
and
look
at
them
with
pleasure
said
the
duke
meanwhile
what
shall
i
give
you
for
this
lisle
gazed
at
the
picture
with
pitiable
agitation
he
was
in
mortal
terror
lest
he
should
scare
his
customer
away
by
asking
too
much
really
he
faltered
i
i
do
know
its
value
i
have
never
he
laughed
what
should
you
think
it
was
worth
the
duke
ought
if
he
had
answered
truthfully
to
have
replied
rather
less
than
nothing
but
he
feigned
to
meditate
severely
then
said
if
fifty
pounds
poor
lisle
gasped
you
you
think
i
was
going
to
say
twenty
we
will
say
fifty
said
the
duke
as
if
he
were
making
an
excellent
bargain
you
have
not
finished
it
yet
no
no
assented
lisle
eagerly
i
will
do
so
carefully
most
carefully
it
it
shall
be
the
most
finished
picture
i
have
ever
painted
i
am
sure
you
will
do
your
best
said
the
duke
i
will
accept
your
kind
invitation
to
see
your
other
pictures
and
now
i
must
be
getting
back
yes
yes
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
temple
said
the
duke
he
glanced
at
leslie
raised
his
hat
was
helped
into
his
chair
by
grey
who
had
stood
immovable
and
impassive
just
out
of
hearing
and
was
wheeled
away
lisle
stood
all
of
a
quiver
for
a
moment
then
beckoned
to
leslie
what
is
it
dear
she
said
soothingly
as
she
saw
his
agitation
had
the
crippled
stranger
told
him
what
the
sketch
was
really
like
that
that
gentleman
has
bought
the
picture
leslie
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
nervous
excitement
and
triumph
you
see
i
told
you
the
day
would
come
and
it
has
come
at
last
luck
has
taken
a
turn
leslie
i
see
a
great
future
before
me
i
only
wanted
some
one
with
an
appreciative
artistic
eye
and
this
temple
is
evidently
possessed
of
one
he
saw
the
value
of
this
at
once
i
noticed
his
face
change
directly
he
looked
at
it
leslie
face
gradually
grew
red
what
what
has
he
given
you
for
it
dear
she
asked
fifty
pounds
exclaimed
lisle
exultingly
fifty
pounds
it
may
not
be
as
much
as
it
is
worth
but
it
is
a
large
sum
to
us
and
i
am
satisfied
more
than
satisfied
i
wonder
what
he
will
do
with
it
do
you
think
he
will
let
me
exhibit
it
i
will
ask
him
not
just
now
but
when
it
is
finished
i
must
finish
it
at
once
where
is
my
olive
green
i
have
left
it
at
home
bring
it
for
me
leslie
it
is
on
the
side
table
she
went
without
a
word
at
the
corner
of
the
street
she
overtook
the
invalid
chair
hesitated
a
moment
walked
on
and
then
came
back
the
duke
peered
up
at
her
from
under
his
brows
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
said
her
breath
coming
and
going
quickly
he
motioned
to
grey
to
withdraw
out
of
hearing
and
struggling
to
keep
her
voice
steady
leslie
went
on
i
want
to
thank
you
but
oh
why
did
you
do
it
i
know
you
know
that
it
it
is
not
worth
it
why
the
duke
smiled
do
not
distress
yourself
miss
lisle
he
said
gently
you
refer
to
my
purchase
of
your
father
picture
yes
she
said
in
a
troubled
voice
it
was
kind
of
you
and
it
has
given
him
oh
you
can
not
tell
what
pleasure
yes
i
think
i
can
it
is
not
the
money
no
just
so
i
understand
and
do
you
understand
that
i
have
bought
something
more
than
the
sketch
miss
lisle
i
not
the
richest
man
in
england
he
was
just
within
the
truth
but
i
can
afford
the
luxury
of
bestowing
pleasure
on
my
fellow
creatures
now
and
again
please
do
begrudge
or
deny
me
that
i
have
not
too
many
pleasures
and
he
glanced
downward
at
his
stunted
figure
of
the
two
i
fancy
i
am
more
pleased
than
your
father
do
say
any
more
and
please
do
look
so
heartbroken
or
you
will
rob
me
of
more
than
half
my
satisfaction
miss
lisle
forgive
me
but
i
think
you
love
your
father
yes
oh
yes
she
breathed
very
well
then
he
said
be
careful
you
do
not
let
him
see
that
you
think
he
has
got
too
good
a
price
for
his
picture
let
him
be
happy
happiness
comes
too
seldom
for
us
to
turn
it
aside
with
a
cold
welcome
leslie
looked
down
at
the
worn
and
lined
face
with
eyes
that
glowed
with
gratitude
i
i
ca
thank
you
mr
temple
she
said
in
a
low
voice
that
thrilled
like
some
exquisite
music
you
have
made
me
happy
and
ah
i
ca
tell
you
what
i
feel
and
she
trembled
and
turned
up
the
street
the
duke
looked
after
her
with
a
wistful
expression
on
his
pale
face
she
is
an
angel
he
murmured
then
his
face
changed
grew
harder
and
cynical
yes
an
angel
at
present
he
said
but
tell
her
that
i
am
the
duke
of
rothbury
and
she
will
become
transformed
into
a
harpy
and
want
to
marry
me
like
the
rest
grey
where
are
you
have
you
gone
to
sleep
are
you
going
to
keep
me
here
all
day
chapter
vi
taking
a
sail
the
moon
rose
early
that
evening
and
flooded
portmaris
with
a
light
that
transformed
it
already
picturesque
enough
into
a
fairy
village
beside
an
enchanted
ocean
leslie
sat
at
the
open
window
of
her
room
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
sea
now
calmly
rippling
as
if
it
were
rocking
itself
to
sleep
in
the
moonbeams
her
father
had
gone
to
bed
early
as
it
was
worn
out
with
his
long
day
work
and
the
excitement
produced
by
the
sale
of
his
picture
and
leslie
was
free
to
recall
the
events
of
the
day
her
life
hitherto
had
been
so
gray
and
sober
so
uneventful
that
the
incidents
which
had
been
crowded
into
this
day
had
almost
bewildered
her
she
ought
in
common
fairness
to
that
individual
have
thought
first
and
most
of
ralph
duncombe
but
it
was
upon
that
other
young
man
who
had
plunged
into
the
waves
to
reach
dick
that
her
mind
was
fixed
beauty
man
beauty
does
count
much
with
women
indeed
it
has
been
remarked
by
the
observant
that
some
of
the
ugliest
men
have
married
the
prettiest
girls
and
it
was
not
yorke
handsome
face
which
had
impressed
leslie
it
would
be
hard
to
say
exactly
what
it
was
in
him
that
had
done
so
perhaps
it
was
the
frank
smile
the
free
and
musical
laugh
that
air
of
his
or
the
pleasant
voice
which
seemed
to
float
in
through
the
window
upon
the
moonbeams
and
find
an
echo
in
leslie
heart
once
or
twice
she
tried
to
cast
him
out
of
her
mind
there
seemed
to
her
something
almost
approaching
unmaidenliness
in
dwelling
so
much
upon
this
stranger
the
young
man
whom
she
had
seen
for
only
a
few
minutes
and
whom
she
might
never
see
again
why
she
did
not
even
know
his
name
or
at
any
rate
only
a
part
of
it
yorke
temple
had
called
him
and
she
murmured
it
absently
yorke
it
seemed
to
her
to
fit
him
exactly
it
had
a
brave
alert
sound
in
it
she
could
fancy
him
ready
for
any
danger
any
emergency
he
had
plunged
into
the
waves
after
dick
as
if
it
were
quite
a
matter
of
course
that
he
should
do
so
had
done
it
as
naturally
as
if
there
were
no
other
course
open
to
him
she
could
see
him
now
as
he
came
out
with
dick
in
his
arms
his
hair
plastered
on
his
face
his
eyes
bright
and
laughing
and
how
anxious
he
had
been
to
avoid
any
thanks
or
fuss
it
was
wicked
of
him
of
course
to
tell
a
story
and
account
for
his
besoaked
condition
by
stating
that
he
had
fallen
off
the
breakwater
leslie
smiled
as
she
thought
of
the
thinness
of
the
excuse
but
she
understood
why
he
had
fibbed
and
forgave
him
do
you
like
this
yorke
dick
she
said
to
dick
who
lay
in
a
contented
coil
on
her
lap
you
ought
to
do
so
for
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
you
would
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
little
doggie
by
this
time
probably
dick
would
have
liked
to
have
retorted
and
if
it
had
been
for
him
i
should
have
gone
in
at
all
then
her
thoughts
wandered
to
the
crippled
hunchback
and
her
heart
thrilled
with
gratitude
as
she
thought
of
his
kindness
whiting
had
said
that
he
was
a
nobleman
but
there
had
evidently
been
a
mistake
very
likely
the
landlady
had
concluded
that
no
one
traveling
with
a
could
be
less
than
a
man
of
title
leslie
thought
of
the
two
men
but
most
of
yorke
and
all
they
had
said
and
done
for
some
time
before
ralph
duncombe
insisted
upon
his
share
in
her
reflections
and
as
she
thought
of
him
she
sighed
she
pitied
him
and
was
sorry
for
him
but
she
did
not
want
to
see
him
again
he
had
frightened
as
well
as
touched
her
by
the
passionate
avowal
which
had
accompanied
the
ring
the
ring
she
had
utterly
forgotten
it
she
put
her
hand
to
her
pocket
turned
it
out
but
the
ring
was
not
there
what
had
she
done
with
it
it
was
fast
closed
in
her
hand
she
remembered
when
she
heard
piteous
yap
and
then
she
had
sprung
up
and
run
down
the
beach
she
must
have
dropped
it
among
the
pebbles
her
heart
smote
her
reproachfully
the
least
she
could
do
in
return
for
the
passionate
love
ralph
duncombe
had
lavished
so
uselessly
upon
her
was
to
keep
his
ring
she
rose
troubled
and
remorseful
the
tide
had
been
going
out
when
she
dropped
it
it
was
not
likely
that
it
would
be
seen
by
any
one
and
it
was
probably
lying
where
it
had
fallen
she
seemed
to
see
the
plain
gold
circlet
lying
there
in
the
silent
night
neglected
and
despised
her
hat
and
jacket
lay
on
the
bed
she
snatched
them
up
put
them
on
hastily
and
left
the
house
a
light
burned
behind
the
windows
of
marine
villa
opposite
and
she
glanced
up
at
it
trying
to
picture
to
herself
the
two
men
in
the
the
one
so
strong
and
stalwart
the
other
so
weak
and
crippled
as
she
went
quickly
down
the
street
she
was
conscious
of
a
new
and
strange
feeling
it
was
half
pleasant
half
painful
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
some
spirit
of
change
had
entered
her
quiet
peaceful
uneventful
life
as
if
she
were
on
the
verge
of
some
novel
experience
the
feeling
disquieted
her
she
looked
up
at
the
stars
almost
hidden
by
the
haze
of
the
glorious
light
thrown
broadcast
by
the
moon
and
there
came
into
her
mind
some
verses
they
were
from
the
persian
though
she
did
not
know
it
which
she
had
seen
under
a
picture
in
one
of
the
academy
exhibitions
love
is
abroad
his
wings
beat
softly
at
heaven
gate
murmuring
the
musical
lines
she
passed
to
the
quay
and
leaping
lightly
onto
the
beach
made
her
way
to
the
breakwater
at
nine
portmaris
as
a
rule
goes
to
bed
no
one
was
stirring
the
street
the
quay
were
empty
the
tide
was
far
out
now
and
the
sands
lay
a
golden
beat
between
sea
and
beach
unbroken
save
where
at
the
very
margin
of
the
lapping
wavelets
a
boat
lay
at
anchor
not
even
a
greater
enthusiast
than
francis
lisle
could
have
desired
a
more
delicious
picture
than
she
made
flitting
slowly
yet
lightly
over
the
beach
her
graceful
figure
casting
a
long
shadow
behind
her
night
is
youth
season
says
the
poet
and
leslie
heart
was
beating
with
a
strange
pulsation
she
reached
the
spot
where
she
had
sat
with
ralph
duncombe
ring
in
her
hand
and
going
down
on
one
knee
searched
carefully
the
bright
light
revealed
every
pebble
and
convinced
at
last
that
it
was
not
there
but
that
she
must
have
held
it
until
she
had
run
some
way
down
the
sands
before
she
dropped
it
she
rose
from
her
knees
with
a
sigh
and
was
going
back
when
she
saw
a
man
form
lying
full
length
on
the
top
of
the
breakwater
it
was
a
young
fisherman
apparently
for
he
was
clad
in
the
blue
jersey
and
long
sea
boots
and
wore
the
red
woolen
cap
common
to
men
and
boys
in
portmaris
he
was
stretched
out
full
length
with
his
head
resting
on
his
arms
his
face
upturned
perfectly
still
and
motionless
it
occurred
to
leslie
that
he
might
have
picked
up
the
ring
and
well
aware
that
his
class
was
as
honest
as
the
day
she
went
up
to
him
saying
have
you
found
a
ring
on
the
beach
just
here
the
man
did
not
answer
nor
move
and
when
she
got
quite
up
to
him
she
saw
that
he
was
asleep
she
saw
too
something
else
that
it
was
not
a
portmaris
fisherman
but
the
young
man
whom
temple
had
called
yorke
with
a
sudden
rush
of
crimson
to
her
face
she
was
about
to
beat
a
retreat
when
yorke
started
slightly
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
up
at
her
the
next
instant
he
was
off
the
breakwater
and
on
his
feet
by
george
he
exclaimed
with
a
bated
breath
it
is
you
miss
lisle
yes
it
is
i
said
leslie
as
calmly
and
composedly
as
she
could
and
from
the
effort
for
composure
her
voice
sounded
rather
cold
i
beg
your
pardon
of
course
it
is
but
he
hesitated
a
moment
well
the
fact
is
i
was
dreaming
about
you
he
stopped
as
if
he
were
afraid
he
had
given
offense
but
leslie
smiled
it
must
have
been
an
uncomfortable
dream
she
said
glancing
at
the
breakwater
no
he
said
i
was
never
more
comfortable
in
my
life
i
more
used
to
roughing
it
than
you
think
i
suppose
it
was
the
beauty
of
the
night
that
tempted
you
as
it
tempted
me
he
went
on
with
his
frank
eyes
on
her
face
leslie
looked
down
she
could
not
ask
him
the
question
she
had
put
to
the
supposed
fisherman
if
he
had
found
her
ring
of
course
he
would
give
it
to
her
yes
she
said
i
told
dolph
it
was
too
good
to
sit
indoors
he
went
on
that
my
cousin
the
man
you
saw
you
know
mr
temple
said
leslie
yes
temple
he
assented
after
a
moment
hesitation
and
i
tried
to
lure
him
out
but
he
does
care
about
stirring
after
dinner
poor
old
chap
he
broke
off
with
a
laugh
you
are
looking
at
my
he
said
leslie
smiled
i
suppose
you
took
me
for
one
of
the
marine
monsters
who
abound
here
fact
is
i
found
my
things
wetter
than
i
supposed
i
knew
you
would
said
leslie
with
an
air
of
gentle
triumph
yes
and
as
i
had
a
change
with
me
i
borrowed
a
suit
from
the
landlady
boy
a
about
six
feet
high
i
fancy
i
rather
upset
my
cousin
man
sitting
down
to
dinner
in
but
they
astonishingly
comfortable
i
half
inclined
to
take
to
them
as
a
regular
thing
after
all
one
might
be
worse
than
a
fisherman
miss
lisle
very
much
said
leslie
with
a
smile
oh
you
surely
not
going
he
said
as
she
half
turned
toward
the
quay
it
far
better
out
here
than
indoors
and
it
early
too
wo
you
walk
across
the
sand
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
it
quite
dry
he
moved
in
that
direction
as
he
spoke
and
leslie
with
a
twinge
of
conscience
moved
also
it
a
pity
all
life
ca
be
a
moonlight
night
he
said
after
a
pause
and
with
a
faint
sigh
by
george
it
would
be
grand
on
the
water
there
just
enough
wind
to
keep
a
boat
going
and
there
a
boat
he
exclaimed
pointing
to
the
boat
lying
at
anchor
at
the
edge
of
the
water
as
if
he
had
made
a
discovery
which
was
to
render
this
weary
world
happy
for
evermore
what
do
you
say
to
going
for
a
little
sail
miss
lisle
he
put
the
question
very
much
as
one
truant
from
school
might
put
it
to
another
only
a
little
more
timorously
it
would
be
splendid
a
thing
to
be
remembered
oh
do
say
no
set
my
heart
upon
it
why
should
you
not
go
said
leslie
trying
to
smile
and
to
keep
from
her
eyes
the
wistful
longing
which
his
audacious
suggestion
had
aroused
by
myself
he
said
reproachfully
and
with
a
kind
of
wonder
i
would
be
so
selfish
come
miss
lisle
i
i
mean
we
may
never
have
another
chance
like
this
you
do
get
such
nights
as
this
in
england
often
and
you
need
not
be
nervous
i
can
manage
a
boat
in
half
a
gale
but
never
mind
if
you
think
you
would
be
safe
this
may
have
been
a
stroke
of
artfulness
or
pure
ingenuousness
it
settled
the
matter
i
have
never
been
afraid
in
my
life
that
i
remember
said
leslie
conscientiously
then
that
settles
it
he
said
in
that
tone
of
free
joyousness
which
appeals
to
a
woman
more
than
any
tone
a
man
can
use
here
we
are
and
by
jove
here
a
real
asleep
in
the
boat
hallo
there
he
called
out
to
an
old
man
who
lay
curled
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
leslie
laughed
softly
it
is
of
no
use
calling
to
him
she
said
he
is
stone
deaf
it
is
old
will
and
he
is
waiting
for
the
turn
of
the
tide
like
a
good
many
more
of
us
said
yorke
cheerfully
and
he
was
about
to
shake
the
man
but
leslie
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
stayed
him
i
i
think
i
had
better
wake
him
she
said
he
is
old
and
not
very
and
i
see
all
right
said
yorke
i
keep
here
in
the
background
if
he
refuses
to
go
tell
him
we
take
his
boat
and
do
without
him
leslie
bent
over
the
gunwale
and
touched
the
old
man
gently
he
stirred
after
a
moment
or
two
and
got
up
on
his
elbow
frowning
at
her
leslie
indicated
by
expressive
pantomime
that
they
wanted
to
go
for
a
sail
and
after
glancing
at
the
sky
and
at
yorke
the
old
fellow
nodded
surlily
and
got
out
of
the
boat
yorke
helped
him
to
push
the
boat
into
the
water
and
now
how
are
you
going
to
get
in
he
said
to
leslie
but
before
she
could
answer
the
question
old
will
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
bodily
into
the
boat
leslie
smiled
he
is
a
very
old
man
and
no
one
in
portmaris
interferes
with
or
contradicts
him
perhaps
because
he
is
deaf
i
see
said
yorke
i
never
realized
until
the
great
advantages
of
that
affliction
he
went
forward
as
he
spoke
to
assist
with
the
sail
but
the
old
man
surlily
waved
him
back
into
the
stern
all
right
william
i
steer
then
he
said
but
he
had
no
sooner
got
hold
of
the
tiller
than
will
angrily
signed
to
him
to
release
it
and
pointed
to
leslie
i
think
he
wants
me
to
steer
she
said
with
a
faint
blush
i
am
often
out
sailing
with
him
he
evidently
regards
me
as
a
land
lubber
whatever
that
is
said
yorke
but
right
the
password
for
is
cross
old
william
he
dropped
down
at
her
feet
and
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
sighed
with
supreme
unbounded
content
and
there
was
silence
for
a
few
minutes
as
the
boat
glided
out
to
sea
then
he
said
do
you
think
old
william
would
fly
into
a
paroxysm
of
rage
if
i
offered
him
a
pipe
of
tobacco
miss
lisle
you
might
try
said
leslie
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
like
an
echo
of
his
the
two
truants
were
enjoying
themselves
and
had
no
thought
of
the
schoolmaster
just
then
yorke
took
out
his
pouch
and
flung
it
with
dextrous
aim
into
the
old
man
lap
he
took
it
up
glowered
at
the
donor
for
a
moment
then
nodded
surlily
and
filling
his
pipe
pitched
the
pouch
back
we
still
live
said
yorke
and
he
was
about
to
fill
his
own
pipe
but
remembered
himself
and
stopped
please
smoke
if
you
wish
to
said
leslie
i
do
not
mind
we
must
not
go
far
she
added
not
farther
than
quebec
or
say
boulogne
said
yorke
all
right
miss
lisle
we
turn
directly
you
say
so
how
delightful
this
is
i
may
have
been
happier
in
the
course
of
an
life
but
i
remember
it
are
you
sorry
you
came
please
answer
truthfully
and
do
mind
my
feelings
but
leslie
did
not
answer
the
strange
feeling
which
had
haunted
her
as
she
left
the
house
was
growing
more
distinct
and
defiant
stronger
and
more
aggressive
was
it
really
she
leslie
lisle
who
was
sailing
over
the
moonlit
sea
with
this
careless
and
young
man
or
should
she
wake
presently
in
her
tiny
room
in
sea
view
and
find
it
all
a
dream
happy
was
this
novel
sensation
as
of
some
vague
undefined
joy
happiness
or
what
she
was
wise
to
leave
the
question
unanswered
yorke
smoked
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
then
he
turned
on
his
elbow
so
that
he
could
look
up
at
her
miss
lisle
he
said
were
you
looking
for
something
when
you
came
down
the
beach
just
now
i
ask
because
i
thought
you
looked
rather
troubled
but
you
were
asleep
said
leslie
he
colored
and
his
eyes
dropped
i
given
myself
away
he
said
penitently
no
miss
lisle
i
was
asleep
but
i
thought
it
better
to
pretend
as
the
children
say
lest
you
should
take
fright
and
run
away
leslie
looked
away
from
him
you
are
angry
well
it
serves
me
right
but
do
think
of
it
try
and
forgive
me
if
you
can
for
i
was
half
asleep
and
i
was
dreaming
of
you
there
i
offended
you
again
but
do
you
know
how
you
can
dream
though
you
are
wide
awake
i
was
wondering
whether
i
should
see
you
again
there
was
no
harm
in
that
was
there
wondering
whether
i
should
have
seen
you
or
spoken
to
you
at
all
if
it
had
been
for
dick
by
the
way
how
is
dick
he
is
all
right
she
said
the
tension
caused
by
his
former
words
suddenly
relieved
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
ever
forgive
you
for
saving
his
life
i
afraid
not
he
said
but
you
have
not
answered
my
question
yet
which
one
asked
leslie
with
a
smile
whether
you
had
lost
anything
he
said
yes
i
had
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
he
put
his
hand
in
his
and
took
out
the
ring
and
held
it
up
is
this
it
he
said
and
his
voice
was
suddenly
grave
and
serious
leslie
took
it
from
his
fingers
thank
you
yes
she
said
where
did
you
find
it
he
was
silent
a
moment
as
if
lost
in
thought
then
he
said
as
if
with
an
effort
on
the
beach
just
where
you
had
been
sitting
this
afternoon
you
dropped
it
i
suppose
yes
said
leslie
there
was
a
pause
you
are
glad
to
get
it
back
yes
she
said
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
an
old
favorite
miss
lisle
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
beautiful
face
over
which
the
moonbeams
fell
lovingly
she
said
the
faint
color
creeping
into
her
cheeks
no
but
you
were
glad
to
get
it
back
you
did
seem
so
very
glad
you
know
no
i
was
not
so
very
glad
she
said
almost
inaudibly
he
seemed
relieved
and
yet
rather
doubtful
still
it
singular
he
said
but
this
is
the
second
thing
of
yours
i
have
found
yes
and
they
say
that
if
you
find
two
things
in
one
day
you
are
sure
to
lose
something
yourself
he
murmured
a
serious
intent
look
coming
into
his
dark
eyes
but
the
day
has
gone
and
you
have
not
lost
anything
said
leslie
with
a
smile
his
eyes
dropped
from
his
intense
regard
of
her
face
i
am
not
so
sure
he
said
did
she
hear
him
chapter
vii
the
duke
sneers
the
boat
sails
on
leslie
has
no
mother
to
watch
over
her
and
warn
her
of
sinning
against
the
great
goddess
propriety
and
as
there
is
no
harm
to
him
who
thinks
none
leslie
is
not
troubled
by
conscience
because
she
is
out
sailing
on
this
heaven
sent
evening
with
a
young
man
and
only
deaf
william
for
chaperon
perhaps
this
is
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
young
man
there
is
no
shyness
about
yorke
and
his
manner
is
just
of
that
kind
to
inspire
confidence
he
treats
leslie
with
a
mixture
of
frankness
and
respect
which
could
not
be
greater
if
he
had
known
her
for
years
instead
of
a
few
hours
only
and
it
is
but
fair
to
add
that
his
manner
toward
a
duchess
would
be
just
the
same
he
is
happy
is
enjoying
himself
to
the
utmost
and
he
assuredly
does
not
trouble
his
head
about
the
proprieties
but
all
the
same
he
is
silent
after
that
last
remark
of
his
which
leslie
may
or
may
not
have
heard
he
is
lying
across
the
boat
so
that
without
much
effort
he
can
see
her
face
what
a
lovely
face
it
is
he
thinks
and
how
thoughtful
is
she
thinking
of
that
letter
he
gave
her
or
of
the
ring
and
who
gave
her
that
it
ought
not
to
matter
to
him
and
yet
the
question
worries
him
not
a
little
he
dismisses
it
with
a
half
audible
i
suppose
these
are
what
are
called
dancing
waves
he
says
at
last
are
you
fond
of
dancing
miss
leslie
but
of
course
you
are
leslie
lets
her
dark
gray
eyes
fall
on
his
handsome
upturned
face
as
if
she
had
been
recalled
to
earth
oh
yes
she
says
all
women
are
are
they
not
but
i
do
not
get
much
dancing
it
is
years
since
i
was
at
a
party
my
father
is
not
strong
and
dislikes
going
out
and
well
there
is
no
one
else
to
go
with
me
besides
i
should
not
leave
him
he
nods
thoughtfully
and
some
idea
of
what
her
life
must
be
dawns
upon
him
you
must
lead
a
very
quiet
life
he
says
leslie
smiles
yes
very
very
quiet
she
assents
what
do
you
do
to
amuse
yourself
he
asks
leslie
thinks
a
moment
oh
she
says
cheerfully
and
without
a
shadow
of
discontent
in
her
voice
or
in
her
face
i
take
walks
when
my
father
does
not
want
me
but
he
usually
likes
me
to
stay
with
him
while
he
is
painting
and
sometimes
william
takes
me
for
a
sail
and
there
is
the
piano
my
father
likes
me
to
play
while
he
is
at
work
but
when
he
does
not
i
read
and
is
that
all
he
says
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
that
he
may
better
see
her
face
all
she
repeats
what
else
is
there
it
seems
a
great
deal
he
does
not
answer
but
he
thinks
of
the
women
he
knows
the
idle
women
who
are
always
restless
and
discontented
unless
they
are
deep
in
some
excitement
riding
driving
ball
and
theater
going
and
as
he
thinks
of
the
difference
between
their
lives
and
this
girl
there
rises
in
his
breast
a
longing
to
brighten
her
life
if
only
for
a
few
hours
a
day
well
he
says
it
sounds
rather
slow
and
and
have
you
led
this
kind
of
life
long
as
long
as
i
can
remember
replies
leslie
papa
and
i
have
been
alone
together
ever
since
i
was
a
little
mite
and
yes
it
has
always
been
the
same
and
you
never
go
to
a
theater
a
dance
a
concert
leslie
laughs
softly
never
is
a
big
word
she
says
oh
yes
when
we
are
in
london
my
father
sometimes
but
very
seldom
takes
me
to
a
theater
and
now
and
again
there
are
dances
at
the
boarding
houses
we
stay
at
yorke
almost
groans
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
take
this
beautiful
young
creature
for
a
whole
round
of
theaters
to
see
her
dressed
in
full
war
paint
to
watch
those
dark
gray
eyes
light
up
with
pleasant
and
girlish
joy
and
which
are
you
most
fond
of
he
asks
walking
sailing
playing
reading
she
thinks
again
i
do
know
i
very
fond
of
the
country
and
enjoy
my
walks
but
then
i
am
also
fond
of
sailing
and
music
and
reading
do
you
know
the
country
round
here
he
shakes
his
head
no
i
only
came
you
know
ah
yes
she
says
and
she
says
it
with
a
faint
feeling
of
surprise
it
seems
to
her
as
if
he
had
been
here
at
portmaris
for
a
week
at
least
there
is
a
very
lovely
place
called
martin
it
is
about
twelve
miles
out
there
is
an
old
castle
or
the
remains
of
one
and
from
the
top
of
it
you
can
see
well
nearly
all
the
world
it
seems
that
must
be
worth
going
to
he
says
and
an
idea
strikes
him
my
cousin
i
mean
temple
you
know
would
like
to
see
that
yes
says
leslie
but
he
could
not
walk
so
far
no
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can
leslie
laughs
softly
oh
yes
i
have
walked
there
and
back
several
times
you
must
be
very
strong
yes
i
think
i
am
i
am
always
well
yes
i
suppose
i
am
strong
he
still
sighs
at
her
the
graceful
figure
is
so
slight
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
realize
her
doing
miles
the
women
he
knows
would
have
a
fit
at
the
mere
thought
of
such
an
undertaking
i
think
is
going
to
be
a
fine
day
he
says
looking
up
at
the
cloudless
sky
with
a
air
yes
says
leslie
as
if
she
were
first
cousin
to
the
clerk
of
the
weather
it
going
to
be
fine
well
then
he
says
i
try
and
get
something
and
drive
my
cousin
over
to
what
the
name
of
the
place
with
the
castle
st
martin
yes
the
worst
of
it
is
that
he
i
mean
my
cousin
and
not
martin
so
soon
gets
bored
if
he
has
some
one
more
amusing
than
i
am
to
keep
him
company
you
see
he
an
invalid
and
crotchety
poor
fellow
murmurs
leslie
and
yet
he
is
so
kind
and
generous
she
adds
as
she
thinks
of
the
fifty
pounds
he
has
given
for
the
picture
yes
indeed
he
assents
the
best
fellow
that
ever
drew
breath
for
all
his
whims
and
fancies
and
he
ca
help
having
those
you
know
he
would
like
to
go
to
martin
especially
if
you
do
you
think
we
could
persuade
you
and
lisle
to
accompany
us
leslie
looks
at
him
almost
startled
then
the
color
comes
into
her
face
and
her
eyes
brighten
it
would
be
awfully
of
you
if
you
would
he
goes
on
quickly
and
as
if
he
knew
he
was
demanding
a
great
sacrifice
of
her
awfully
good
nature
my
father
leslie
shakes
her
head
i
am
afraid
he
would
not
go
he
will
want
to
paint
if
the
day
is
fine
he
can
paint
at
martin
he
breaks
in
eagerly
there
must
be
no
end
of
sketches
studies
whatever
you
call
it
there
you
know
i
wish
you
ask
him
it
would
do
my
cousin
so
much
good
and
and
the
arch
hypocrite
falters
as
he
meets
the
innocent
eagerly
wistful
eyes
though
i
dare
say
you
wo
care
for
the
dusty
drive
and
have
seen
quite
enough
of
the
place
still
you
be
doing
a
good
action
do
you
know
and
all
that
it
will
cheer
my
cousin
up
sooner
than
anything
very
well
says
leslie
i
will
ask
my
father
but
it
will
not
matter
if
we
do
not
go
you
must
persuade
mr
temple
oh
my
cousin
yes
he
says
with
sudden
embarrassment
yes
of
course
thank
you
it
is
awfully
good
of
you
leslie
looks
at
him
her
color
deepening
then
she
laughs
softly
why
i
want
to
go
too
she
says
there
is
no
goodness
in
it
yorke
auchester
glance
falls
before
her
guileless
eyes
then
that
settles
it
he
says
confidently
what
point
is
that
out
there
miss
lisle
leslie
starts
that
is
ragged
points
she
replies
i
had
no
idea
we
had
come
so
far
please
tell
him
i
am
going
to
put
the
boat
round
it
must
be
very
late
no
it
is
he
says
i
can
tell
by
the
moon
ca
we
go
a
little
farther
but
she
ports
the
helm
and
old
william
without
a
word
swings
the
sail
over
and
the
boat
nose
is
pointing
to
land
yorke
looks
at
portmaris
asleep
in
the
moonlight
regretfully
that
the
worst
of
being
thoroughly
happy
and
comfortable
he
says
it
always
comes
to
an
end
and
you
have
to
come
back
what
a
pace
we
are
going
too
he
adds
almost
in
a
tone
of
complaint
the
wind
is
with
us
says
leslie
i
should
like
to
stay
at
portmaris
and
buy
a
boat
he
says
after
a
moment
or
two
it
would
be
very
jolly
leslie
smiles
it
is
not
always
fine
even
at
portmaris
she
says
sometimes
the
waves
are
mountain
high
and
the
sea
runs
up
over
the
quay
as
if
it
meant
to
wash
the
village
away
well
i
should
mind
that
he
remarks
i
wonder
why
one
lives
in
london
one
is
always
grunting
at
and
slanging
it
and
yet
one
hangs
on
there
he
sighs
inaudibly
as
he
thinks
of
what
it
must
be
with
its
feverish
crowd
its
glaring
lights
its
yelling
cabmen
and
struggling
horses
thinks
of
the
folly
and
alas
the
wickedness
and
glances
at
the
lovely
peaceful
face
above
him
with
a
great
yearning
and
regret
i
like
london
says
leslie
but
then
i
go
there
so
seldom
that
it
is
a
holiday
place
to
me
i
know
he
responds
yes
i
can
understand
that
and
i
like
portmaris
because
it
is
a
holiday
place
to
me
i
suppose
leslie
smiles
i
hope
you
will
not
catch
cold
and
be
all
the
worse
for
this
holiday
she
says
he
laughs
there
is
no
fear
of
that
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
you
must
sit
firm
now
she
warns
him
i
am
going
to
drive
the
boat
on
to
the
sand
here
already
he
remarks
as
the
keel
of
the
boat
touches
bottom
and
the
sails
run
down
with
a
musical
thud
and
he
steps
over
the
side
and
so
suddenly
that
the
boat
lurches
over
after
him
he
puts
out
his
strong
arm
to
stay
her
from
falling
while
old
william
curses
the
land
lubber
in
accents
low
but
deep
i
about
as
awkward
in
a
small
boat
as
a
hippopotamus
he
says
remorsefully
will
you
let
me
help
you
ashore
he
means
carry
you
and
he
holds
out
his
arms
but
leslie
shrinks
back
ever
so
slightly
and
old
william
comes
to
the
side
of
the
boat
and
picks
her
up
as
a
matter
of
course
yorke
slips
a
sovereign
into
the
old
man
horny
palm
and
william
who
is
not
dumb
as
well
as
deaf
would
probably
open
his
lips
now
but
for
astonishment
and
amazed
delight
he
does
however
grin
as
the
two
walk
up
the
beach
yorke
looks
behind
him
at
the
moonlit
sea
and
the
boats
and
shakes
his
head
it
was
a
shame
to
come
in
he
says
but
never
mind
perhaps
he
stops
not
daring
to
finish
the
sentence
but
he
feels
as
if
he
would
cheerfully
give
half
the
amount
of
the
check
in
his
pocket
for
such
another
sail
in
the
same
company
the
quay
is
empty
the
street
silent
but
as
they
go
up
it
they
see
the
crippled
temple
leaning
against
the
door
of
marine
villa
his
keen
eyes
rest
upon
them
both
where
have
you
been
he
asks
where
you
ought
to
have
been
dolph
replies
yorke
on
the
water
you
ca
imagine
what
it
is
like
oh
yes
i
can
says
the
duke
but
i
am
too
old
for
moonlight
sails
i
am
a
have
you
enjoyed
it
miss
lisle
leslie
smiles
for
answer
look
here
dolph
says
yorke
with
affected
carelessness
what
do
you
say
to
driving
out
to
a
place
called
martin
going
to
try
and
persuade
miss
lisle
and
her
father
to
show
us
the
way
the
duke
looks
at
her
i
shall
be
very
glad
he
says
will
you
come
miss
lisle
if
my
father
begins
leslie
and
the
duke
interrupts
her
we
ought
to
send
a
formal
invitation
he
says
with
a
smile
will
you
give
lisle
our
compliments
miss
lisle
and
tell
him
how
much
the
duke
of
rothbury
and
temple
will
be
indebted
to
him
if
you
and
he
will
accompany
them
on
a
drive
leslie
looks
from
one
to
the
other
for
a
moment
as
if
she
did
not
understand
the
duke
of
rothbury
can
he
be
jesting
the
duke
struggles
with
a
smile
as
he
sees
her
astonishment
then
he
says
casually
i
hope
you
found
the
duke
a
good
sailor
miss
lisle
leslie
glances
at
yorke
who
stands
staring
at
his
fishermen
boots
with
a
moody
and
not
well
pleased
expression
on
his
face
i
nearly
upset
the
boat
he
says
as
if
to
account
for
his
change
of
countenance
it
did
not
matter
she
says
we
were
on
the
sands
yes
i
will
tell
my
father
and
thank
you
very
much
if
the
duke
expected
her
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
announcement
of
the
title
he
is
doomed
to
disappointment
the
first
sensation
of
surprise
over
leslie
is
as
calm
and
as
before
she
says
in
her
sweet
low
voice
and
a
moment
afterward
the
door
of
sea
view
is
closed
upon
her
the
duke
looked
at
his
cousin
downcast
face
with
a
whimsical
smile
how
well
she
took
it
he
said
a
london
girl
of
the
most
accomplished
type
could
not
have
concealed
her
flutters
with
greater
ease
she
had
nothing
to
conceal
said
yorke
with
averted
eyes
it
matter
to
her
that
that
you
called
me
a
duke
why
should
it
why
should
it
my
dear
yorke
you
have
grown
simple
during
your
moonlight
sail
oh
she
was
confused
and
flustered
believe
me
but
all
her
sex
are
actresses
from
the
cradle
give
me
your
hand
and
let
us
go
in
yorke
helped
him
up
the
stairs
and
into
his
chair
then
stood
gazing
moodily
out
of
the
window
your
outing
seems
to
have
made
you
melancholy
yorke
said
the
duke
and
yet
you
looked
as
if
you
enjoyed
it
just
now
so
i
did
but
dolph
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
told
her
that
infer
that
nonsense
the
duke
leaned
back
and
looked
at
him
with
real
or
simulated
surprise
why
not
he
asked
have
you
forgotten
our
bargain
agreement
yes
i
had
forgotten
it
replied
yorke
grimly
so
soon
why
are
you
so
put
out
what
does
it
matter
you
are
going
you
forget
the
drive
the
appointment
but
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
go
as
you
say
said
yorke
you
can
make
some
excuse
nonsense
if
you
care
for
this
outing
stay
and
go
it
will
only
mean
one
more
day
and
london
will
not
fall
to
pieces
because
of
your
absence
for
hours
it
is
not
that
well
what
is
it
then
are
you
thinking
of
this
girl
yorke
flushed
and
turned
to
the
window
again
what
does
it
matter
went
on
the
duke
she
is
a
nice
girl
but
my
dear
yorke
and
his
voice
grew
grave
even
if
we
had
not
made
this
little
arrangement
about
the
title
she
would
be
nothing
more
to
you
than
just
a
pleasant
young
lady
whom
you
chanced
to
meet
at
an
outlandish
place
on
the
west
coast
yorke
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
or
rather
young
whiting
and
the
flush
on
his
face
grew
deeper
i
know
that
he
said
as
grimly
as
before
very
well
then
i
repeat
what
does
it
matter
if
you
are
annoyed
because
in
accordance
with
an
arrangement
i
introduced
you
as
the
duke
why
on
earth
did
you
consent
it
is
too
late
now
even
if
i
had
told
her
grey
or
the
woman
of
the
house
here
or
some
one
else
would
have
done
so
morning
it
is
too
late
i
suppose
broke
in
yorke
moodily
quite
too
late
retorts
the
duke
decisively
to
tell
the
truth
now
would
create
a
sensation
and
fuss
which
would
be
unendurable
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
as
he
spoke
and
moaned
faintly
as
if
in
pain
give
me
that
small
vial
off
the
table
will
you
please
he
said
one
of
his
periodical
attacks
of
nervous
neuralgia
was
coming
on
and
at
such
times
he
was
wont
to
grow
irritable
yorke
poured
out
some
of
the
medicine
and
gave
it
to
him
thanks
yes
it
would
make
a
hideous
fuss
we
should
have
it
in
the
papers
headed
ducal
hoax
or
something
of
that
kind
but
i
want
to
force
you
into
anything
against
your
will
i
can
leave
here
the
first
thing
i
certainly
should
go
if
you
departed
from
our
arrangement
i
came
down
here
for
rest
and
quiet
and
i
should
get
none
if
it
were
known
who
i
am
yes
we
better
go
no
no
said
yorke
after
all
as
you
say
it
does
not
matter
besides
besides
i
should
care
to
deprive
her
of
the
little
bit
of
pleasure
i
planned
for
her
i
fancy
she
does
get
too
much
of
it
i
dare
say
not
very
well
then
you
stay
till
after
for
goodness
sake
try
and
look
a
little
less
funereal
you
had
no
objection
to
assuming
the
role
till
you
met
this
girl
what
difference
does
she
make
you
think
she
will
make
love
to
you
eh
i
should
have
thought
from
what
i
know
of
you
yorke
that
you
would
have
no
very
great
objection
to
that
yorke
swung
round
almost
angrily
look
here
dolph
he
said
grimly
you
are
altogether
mistaken
about
her
i
tell
you
that
she
does
not
care
and
will
not
care
whether
i
or
you
are
the
duke
she
is
not
that
sort
of
girl
at
all
the
duke
was
in
a
paroxysm
of
pain
intense
enough
to
turn
a
saint
cynical
he
sneered
i
know
them
all
root
and
branch
he
said
his
thin
voice
rendered
shrill
and
cutting
by
his
agony
i
tell
you
that
she
will
make
love
to
you
that
thinking
you
are
the
duke
she
will
try
and
marry
you
as
she
would
try
and
marry
me
if
she
knew
the
truth
no
said
yorke
shortly
almost
fiercely
i
say
that
she
would
not
care
you
seem
to
have
learned
her
nature
very
quickly
retorted
the
duke
with
another
sneer
yorke
colored
and
turned
away
i
tell
you
that
she
will
turn
out
like
the
rest
you
deny
it
doubt
it
very
well
play
the
part
you
have
assumed
and
if
i
am
wrong
i
will
admit
i
have
done
her
an
injustice
you
do
her
a
cruel
injustice
said
yorke
in
a
low
voice
very
well
then
shouted
the
duke
try
her
try
her
and
then
own
that
i
was
right
ah
you
afraid
you
know
in
your
heart
that
she
would
not
stand
the
test
your
innocent
girl
would
prove
like
the
rest
come
you
are
beaten
better
spare
her
the
disappointment
of
setting
her
cap
at
a
false
duke
better
go
my
dear
yorke
yorke
swung
round
his
face
pale
an
angry
light
in
his
eyes
no
i
stay
he
said
chapter
viii
yorke
auchester
as
a
strategist
when
leslie
wakes
next
morning
she
wonders
what
it
is
that
sends
a
thrill
of
happiness
through
her
then
as
with
dazed
eyes
she
looks
through
the
sunny
window
she
remembers
the
proposed
expedition
to
martin
but
she
remembers
also
that
the
companion
of
last
evening
is
a
duke
and
her
spirits
droop
suddenly
it
is
difficult
to
persuade
her
father
to
join
in
the
mildest
of
excursions
it
will
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
induce
him
to
accept
an
invitation
to
drive
with
a
duke
some
women
would
have
experienced
an
added
joy
at
the
thought
that
they
had
been
honored
with
civility
from
a
person
of
such
high
rank
but
the
fact
rather
lessens
pleasure
yorke
did
her
justice
she
is
not
elated
nor
awed
by
the
ducal
title
when
she
comes
down
to
breakfast
she
finds
her
father
posing
in
front
of
his
picture
his
thin
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
his
head
bent
and
as
she
kisses
him
he
sighs
rather
querulously
is
anything
the
matter
dear
she
asks
i
got
a
headache
he
replies
i
i
do
not
feel
up
to
work
and
i
am
so
anxious
to
get
on
how
do
you
think
it
looks
leslie
draws
him
away
from
the
easel
to
the
table
and
forces
him
gently
into
his
chair
we
will
not
look
at
it
this
morning
at
any
rate
until
we
have
had
breakfast
dear
she
says
it
is
wonderful
how
much
better
and
brighter
this
world
and
everything
in
it
looks
after
a
cup
of
coffee
but
papa
you
must
not
work
you
must
take
a
rest
a
rest
he
begins
impatiently
yes
you
know
how
often
you
say
that
working
against
the
grain
is
time
and
energy
wasted
and
there
is
another
reason
dear
she
goes
on
brightly
we
have
an
invitation
for
a
what
he
asks
querulously
an
invitation
dear
we
have
been
asked
to
drive
to
martin
last
night
a
faint
blush
rises
to
her
face
i
ran
down
to
the
beach
to
to
find
something
i
had
lost
and
i
saw
temple
friend
and
we
went
for
a
sail
with
old
william
and
afterward
i
saw
temple
outside
marine
villa
and
they
have
been
kind
enough
to
ask
us
to
go
with
them
to
martin
it
was
the
duke
who
asked
us
she
adds
candidly
but
temple
was
just
as
kind
and
pressing
i
hope
you
will
go
dear
he
puts
the
thin
straggling
hair
from
his
forehead
with
a
nervous
gesture
what
are
you
talking
about
leslie
what
duke
leslie
laughs
softly
it
appears
that
the
young
man
who
went
in
for
dick
yesterday
temple
friend
is
a
duke
the
duke
of
rothbury
she
replies
like
herself
he
is
neither
elated
nor
awed
but
he
lisps
a
distinct
refusal
of
the
invitation
the
duke
of
rothbury
he
says
i
i
think
i
heard
the
title
somewhere
why
do
they
ask
us
to
go
with
them
i
do
want
to
go
and
i
suppose
you
do
care
for
it
they
are
strangers
perfect
strangers
to
us
he
has
already
proved
himself
a
very
kind
friend
says
leslie
gently
he
flushes
you
mean
in
buying
the
picture
yes
yes
but
you
know
how
i
dislike
strangers
and
and
excursions
of
this
kind
and
if
you
do
want
to
go
very
much
i
rather
not
besides
i
do
particularly
care
about
making
the
acquaintance
of
a
duke
i
am
an
artist
a
professional
man
and
i
do
not
believe
in
associating
with
persons
so
far
above
me
in
rank
no
we
had
better
decline
i
dare
say
my
head
will
be
all
right
presently
and
i
shall
be
able
to
work
and
you
can
come
with
me
and
mix
the
colors
and
so
on
very
well
dear
she
says
struggling
to
suppress
a
sigh
you
shall
do
just
as
you
like
i
should
have
liked
to
have
gone
and
the
drive
would
have
done
you
good
i
am
quite
well
and
i
hate
long
drives
he
responds
emphatically
especially
in
the
company
of
dukes
what
is
he
doing
down
here
he
asks
testily
did
you
say
you
went
for
a
sail
with
him
last
evening
yes
says
leslie
with
a
sigh
that
will
not
be
suppressed
as
she
thinks
of
the
moonlit
sea
and
the
pleasant
companion
who
unfortunately
has
turned
out
to
be
a
duke
yes
and
he
was
very
kind
and
nice
and
not
a
bit
like
so
grand
a
personage
she
adds
with
a
smile
he
looked
exactly
like
a
fisherman
last
night
and
talked
like
a
young
man
fresh
from
school
or
college
he
is
not
my
idea
of
a
duke
at
all
i
fancy
i
must
have
thought
that
dukes
talked
in
blank
verse
and
habitually
wore
their
coronets
and
robes
he
waves
the
subject
aside
with
nervous
impatience
i
do
know
anything
about
them
and
i
do
want
to
he
says
getting
up
and
fidgeting
round
the
picture
i
got
this
sky
too
deep
i
think
and
he
continues
in
an
inaudible
mutter
leslie
knows
that
it
is
useless
to
say
any
more
and
is
silent
and
when
her
breakfast
things
are
cleared
away
she
gets
out
her
plain
little
desk
to
write
a
refusal
but
at
the
outset
she
finds
herself
in
a
difficulty
and
miss
lisle
regret
sounds
too
formal
after
that
eminently
informal
sail
last
night
and
yet
she
does
not
know
how
to
begin
her
note
in
the
first
person
should
she
address
him
as
dear
duke
or
your
grace
or
my
lord
or
how
did
you
ever
write
to
a
duke
papa
she
asks
at
last
playing
a
tattoo
with
the
upon
her
white
even
teeth
never
thank
heaven
he
says
absently
then
you
can
not
help
me
she
says
with
a
sigh
and
ultimately
she
puts
the
note
in
the
formal
method
miss
lisle
presents
her
compliments
to
the
duke
of
rothbury
and
regrets
that
she
and
lisle
are
unable
to
accept
his
kind
invitation
for
it
looks
dreadfully
stilted
and
ungrateful
she
says
to
herself
but
it
will
certainly
remove
any
risk
of
further
acquaintance
and
papa
will
not
be
worried
into
knowing
such
a
great
personage
she
sends
the
note
over
by
merrick
small
servant
and
in
five
minutes
that
diminutive
maid
comes
back
and
mouthed
with
awe
and
importance
if
you
please
miss
i
gave
the
note
to
the
gentleman
what
wheels
the
other
gentleman
chair
and
he
says
the
duke
has
gone
to
northcliffe
but
he
give
him
the
note
when
he
comes
back
leslie
laughs
rather
ruefully
we
need
not
have
worried
about
the
drive
to
martin
papa
she
says
the
duke
has
forgotten
all
about
it
but
the
artist
is
painting
away
vigorously
and
apparently
does
not
hear
her
and
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
which
it
is
useless
to
struggle
against
she
gets
out
some
work
and
seats
herself
at
the
open
window
she
has
proved
more
reliable
than
the
usual
run
of
weather
prophets
and
the
day
is
all
she
prognosticated
the
street
is
bathed
in
sunlight
the
sea
is
sparkling
as
if
it
had
been
sprinkled
with
amethysts
there
is
a
soft
breeze
laden
with
the
perfume
of
the
early
summer
flowers
in
the
cottage
gardens
a
thrush
perched
on
a
tree
close
by
is
singing
with
all
its
might
and
main
it
would
have
been
very
pleasant
that
proposed
drive
to
martin
the
morning
passes
slowly
onward
the
artist
too
absorbed
by
his
work
to
notice
the
sunlight
or
the
sea
or
the
birds
is
still
painting
when
with
the
striking
of
the
midday
hour
there
mingles
the
click
clack
of
horses
hoofs
on
the
stony
street
and
leslie
looking
up
with
a
start
for
she
has
been
thinking
of
all
she
has
lost
sees
a
wagonette
and
a
pair
of
stylish
bays
draw
up
to
the
door
on
the
box
is
yorke
no
longer
in
the
fisherman
jersey
but
clad
in
harris
tweed
his
handsome
face
bright
and
cheerful
his
whole
get
up
and
manner
suggesting
pleasure
and
a
holiday
after
quieting
the
spirited
horses
with
words
and
a
touch
of
the
whip
he
looks
down
from
his
high
perch
and
seeing
the
startled
eyes
looking
up
at
him
raises
his
hat
and
smiles
are
you
ready
he
inquires
just
as
he
inquired
last
night
leslie
shakes
her
head
and
tries
to
smile
but
the
effort
is
a
failure
and
putting
down
her
work
she
comes
to
the
open
door
oh
i
am
so
sorry
she
says
did
you
not
get
my
note
what
note
he
asks
stand
still
will
you
no
i
have
seen
any
note
what
was
it
about
we
can
not
come
she
says
with
a
look
at
the
horses
which
is
more
wistful
even
than
she
knows
his
face
clouds
instantly
not
come
oh
i
say
has
anything
happened
why
not
it
the
loveliest
day
yes
is
it
she
assents
shading
her
eyes
and
looking
round
but
my
father
is
not
well
he
has
a
headache
and
why
that
all
the
more
reason
he
should
go
he
responds
promptly
the
drive
would
set
him
straight
he
urges
remonstratively
look
here
i
go
and
speak
to
him
and
while
you
do
the
horses
will
run
away
straight
into
the
sea
she
says
with
a
smile
no
they
wo
if
you
do
mind
just
standing
by
this
one
the
near
one
if
he
moves
growl
at
him
like
this
still
he
stop
directly
well
i
try
she
says
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
and
he
goes
straight
into
the
room
lisle
looks
up
at
him
with
impatient
surprise
and
it
is
as
if
the
young
fellow
had
brought
the
brilliant
sunlight
in
with
him
lisle
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
coming
says
yorke
coming
where
he
has
forgotten
all
about
the
invitation
why
to
somewhere
or
other
says
yorke
it
never
entered
my
head
that
you
refuse
why
should
you
if
you
do
care
about
it
yourself
you
ought
to
go
for
miss
leslie
sake
she
wants
a
change
an
outing
any
one
can
see
that
perhaps
you
have
noticed
how
pale
she
looks
this
morning
oh
yorke
leslie
is
all
right
says
lisle
irritably
she
is
always
strong
and
well
i
sorry
we
can
not
accompany
you
but
i
beg
your
pardon
you
are
standing
in
my
light
thank
you
yorke
looks
from
the
pale
livid
face
of
the
dreamer
to
the
impossible
picture
on
the
easel
and
bites
his
lips
he
is
sorely
tempted
to
catch
up
the
artist
easel
and
all
and
bundle
them
into
the
carriage
then
a
far
better
and
more
feasible
idea
strikes
him
i
sorry
you
ca
go
lisle
he
says
as
indifferently
as
he
can
because
i
thought
of
asking
you
to
make
a
rough
sketch
of
the
castle
for
me
want
it
for
my
own
room
you
know
i
awfully
mad
on
water
colors
lisle
looks
up
with
awakened
interest
there
is
a
good
sketch
to
be
got
out
of
the
west
end
the
turret
he
murmurs
absently
that
just
what
i
wanted
yorke
strikes
in
promptly
that
the
bit
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
paint
come
along
sir
allow
me
and
he
catches
up
the
portable
easel
and
paint
box
and
carries
them
out
before
lisle
can
realize
what
is
being
done
all
right
yorke
cries
to
the
astonished
leslie
he
is
coming
run
in
and
put
your
things
on
and
do
give
him
time
to
think
but
falters
leslie
a
smile
beginning
to
break
on
the
lovely
face
but
nothing
he
cuts
in
please
be
quick
or
he
have
time
to
change
his
mind
leslie
runs
in
laughing
and
yorke
stowing
the
easel
under
the
seat
shouts
out
for
grey
tell
the
temple
we
ready
he
says
quickly
got
that
hamper
yes
your
grace
says
grey
confound
all
right
then
get
your
master
down
as
soon
as
possible
and
grey
bring
me
out
a
glass
of
ale
that
was
a
narrow
squeak
and
he
draws
a
long
breath
what
let
him
deprive
her
of
her
outing
not
if
i
had
to
take
the
house
as
well
presently
the
duke
and
grey
come
out
and
grey
helps
him
into
his
seat
they
have
not
long
to
wait
for
the
other
two
and
yorke
looks
approvingly
at
the
slim
graceful
figure
which
plainly
dressed
though
it
may
be
is
unmistakably
that
of
a
lady
lisle
scarcely
knowing
what
they
are
doing
with
him
is
bundled
in
and
yorke
as
a
matter
of
course
stands
by
to
assist
leslie
to
the
seat
on
the
box
beside
him
but
would
not
some
one
else
like
to
sit
there
she
says
hesitatingly
i
am
sure
lisle
would
be
more
comfortable
inside
he
says
and
we
must
keep
the
horses
waiting
longer
than
we
can
help
please
he
says
and
he
puts
his
hand
under
her
elbow
and
hoists
her
up
carefully
then
he
springs
into
his
place
touches
the
horses
with
the
whip
and
away
they
go
leslie
draws
a
long
breath
it
is
not
until
they
have
got
to
the
open
country
that
she
can
believe
that
they
have
actually
started
it
was
a
near
thing
he
says
as
if
he
were
reading
her
thoughts
yes
and
she
smiles
i
do
know
how
you
managed
it
he
laughs
it
was
done
by
force
of
arms
i
meant
you
i
mean
lisle
to
go
and
when
i
mean
a
thing
i
hard
to
obstruct
this
is
rather
a
grand
yorke
remarks
the
duke
may
one
ask
where
and
how
you
got
it
it
does
look
like
a
hired
affair
it
is
he
replies
when
i
got
to
northcliffe
i
ran
against
little
vinson
who
appears
to
be
staying
there
the
wagon
was
standing
outside
and
he
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
go
for
a
drive
i
said
i
should
if
he
let
me
have
the
horses
and
not
ask
to
go
with
me
he
stared
for
a
minute
then
he
took
off
his
gloves
and
here
you
are
you
know
was
that
rather
cool
asks
the
duke
yorke
laughs
oh
he
a
little
chap
and
did
seem
to
mind
said
he
go
for
a
sail
instead
he
must
be
very
said
leslie
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
so
he
ought
to
be
he
as
rich
as
croesus
and
has
a
care
in
the
world
his
father
lord
eastford
you
know
bought
up
a
lot
of
nursery
gardens
just
outside
what
was
then
london
and
they
turned
out
a
gold
mine
the
part
got
fashionable
you
know
the
mention
of
a
lord
reminds
leslie
she
had
forgotten
it
until
now
that
the
young
man
beside
her
is
a
duke
and
she
wonders
whether
she
ought
to
have
addressed
him
as
your
grace
now
miss
lisle
he
says
you
got
to
play
the
part
of
guide
you
know
is
it
straight
on
or
how
straight
on
your
grace
she
says
thinking
she
will
try
how
it
sounds
it
does
sound
very
well
in
her
own
ears
nor
apparently
in
his
for
he
stops
in
the
act
of
flicking
a
fly
off
the
horse
harness
and
looks
at
her
but
he
does
not
make
any
remark
the
roads
are
good
the
day
heavenly
and
as
they
bowl
along
leslie
leans
back
wrapped
in
a
supreme
content
her
father
voice
discoursing
of
art
floats
now
and
again
toward
her
the
thud
thud
of
the
horses
hoofs
makes
pleasant
music
and
if
she
should
tire
of
the
pretty
scenery
there
is
the
handsome
face
of
a
young
man
beside
her
to
look
at
for
a
change
leslie
does
not
know
very
much
about
driving
but
she
knows
that
he
is
driving
well
that
the
horses
fresh
and
as
they
are
are
thoroughly
under
his
control
and
she
finds
herself
admiring
the
way
in
which
he
handles
the
whip
and
the
reins
may
one
ask
what
you
are
thinking
of
miss
leslie
he
says
glancing
at
her
after
a
long
silence
i
was
wondering
which
i
liked
best
sailing
or
driving
she
replies
but
you
have
driven
yet
he
says
would
you
like
to
drive
leslie
shakes
her
head
i
should
drive
them
into
a
ditch
or
they
would
run
away
with
me
she
says
smiling
not
a
bit
of
it
he
retorts
and
i
know
you
are
not
afraid
because
you
said
last
night
that
you
never
were
afraid
did
i
say
that
she
says
what
wonderful
things
one
says
in
the
moonlight
see
here
he
says
i
show
you
how
to
hold
the
reins
if
i
am
not
afraid
they
will
be
if
they
think
you
are
going
to
transfer
these
wild
animals
to
my
guidance
and
she
glances
over
her
shoulder
oh
they
all
right
he
says
carelessly
give
me
your
hand
no
the
left
one
that
it
he
takes
it
and
opens
the
slim
fingers
and
inserts
the
reins
in
their
proper
places
and
as
he
does
so
notices
if
he
did
not
notice
last
night
how
beautifully
shaped
and
refined
the
small
hand
is
that
right
now
take
the
whip
in
your
right
hand
and
how
do
you
feel
as
if
i
were
chained
to
two
romping
lions
and
they
were
dragging
me
off
the
box
he
laughs
the
frank
free
laugh
which
leslie
thinks
the
pleasantest
she
ever
heard
you
make
a
splendid
whip
he
says
encouragingly
hold
tight
and
do
be
afraid
of
them
directly
you
begin
to
think
they
are
getting
too
many
for
you
set
your
teeth
hard
hold
like
a
vise
and
give
each
a
flick
so
see
they
know
you
master
then
the
ivory
white
of
leslie
face
is
delicately
tinted
with
rose
her
eyes
are
shining
brightly
her
heart
beating
to
the
old
tune
happiness
there
is
a
cart
coming
and
there
is
room
oh
dear
and
she
begins
to
get
flurried
plenty
of
room
he
says
coolly
you
should
shout
to
the
man
but
i
do
that
for
you
and
he
wakes
the
sleeping
wagoner
with
a
shout
that
causes
the
man
to
spring
up
and
drag
his
horses
aside
as
if
juggernaut
were
coming
down
upon
him
see
that
the
way
oh
do
splendidly
and
i
shall
be
quite
proud
of
you
i
fond
of
driving
do
you
know
i
often
thought
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
that
take
to
a
hansom
cab
leslie
stares
at
him
a
duke
driving
a
hansom
cab
would
be
rather
a
novelty
would
it
she
says
with
a
smile
to
her
surprise
his
face
flushes
and
he
turns
his
head
away
what
has
she
said
at
this
moment
fortunately
for
yorke
embarrassment
the
duke
remarks
with
intentional
distinctness
are
you
insured
against
accidents
miss
lisle
leslie
holds
out
the
reins
you
see
she
says
they
are
getting
frightened
and
not
without
cause
but
he
will
not
take
the
reins
from
her
i
know
you
are
enjoying
it
he
says
just
as
a
schoolboy
would
speak
you
all
right
i
help
you
if
you
come
to
a
fix
give
that
off
one
a
cut
he
is
letting
the
other
do
all
the
work
which
is
the
off
one
she
asks
innocently
he
points
to
it
that
the
one
so
called
because
you
do
let
him
off
it
is
a
feeble
joke
but
leslie
rewards
it
with
a
laugh
far
and
away
beyond
its
merits
and
he
laughs
in
harmony
you
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourselves
up
there
says
the
duke
pray
hand
any
joke
down
it
is
miss
leslie
making
puns
responds
yorke
now
you
are
getting
tired
he
says
after
a
mile
or
two
how
do
you
know
she
asks
curiously
because
i
can
see
your
hands
trembling
he
replies
give
me
the
reins
now
and
if
you
are
a
good
girl
you
shall
drive
all
the
way
home
it
is
a
little
thing
that
he
should
have
such
regard
for
her
comfort
but
it
does
not
pass
unnoticed
by
leslie
as
she
resigns
the
reins
with
a
thank
you
your
grace
his
face
clouds
again
however
and
he
bestows
an
altogether
unnecessary
cut
on
the
horses
who
plunge
forward
there
is
martin
and
there
is
the
castle
she
says
presently
is
it
not
pretty
very
he
assents
but
he
looks
round
inquiringly
i
looking
for
some
place
in
which
to
put
the
cattle
up
he
explains
horses
care
much
for
ruins
unless
there
are
hay
and
oats
there
is
a
small
inn
at
the
foot
of
the
castle
says
leslie
that
all
right
then
he
rejoins
cheerfully
hurry
up
now
my
beauties
and
let
show
them
what
vinson
nags
can
do
they
dash
up
the
road
to
the
inn
at
a
clinking
pace
and
pull
up
in
masterly
style
the
landlord
and
a
stable
boy
come
running
out
and
yorke
flings
them
the
reins
then
he
helps
leslie
down
and
goes
round
to
the
back
to
assist
the
duke
i
suppose
we
shall
be
able
to
get
some
lunch
here
yorke
he
says
as
he
leans
on
his
sticks
lunch
indoors
on
a
day
like
this
not
much
retorts
yorke
scornfully
out
with
that
hamper
grey
and
get
this
yokel
to
help
you
carry
it
to
the
tower
you
can
walk
as
far
as
that
dolph
miss
lisle
will
show
you
the
way
at
the
sound
of
her
name
leslie
turns
from
the
rustic
window
into
which
she
had
been
mechanically
looking
oh
yes
there
has
been
another
party
here
this
morning
she
adds
how
do
you
know
that
asks
yorke
because
i
can
see
the
remains
of
their
luncheon
on
the
table
she
says
laughing
yes
sir
says
the
landlord
party
of
three
sir
two
gentlemen
and
a
lady
thank
goodness
they
have
gone
says
yorke
you
go
on
i
go
and
see
that
the
horses
are
rubbed
down
and
fed
i
owe
that
to
vinson
anyhow
he
is
not
long
in
following
them
but
by
the
time
he
has
reached
the
tower
grey
has
unpacked
the
basket
and
laid
out
a
tempting
lunch
there
is
a
fowl
a
ham
an
fruit
tart
cream
some
jelly
the
crispiest
of
loaves
and
firmest
of
butter
and
a
couple
of
bottles
with
golden
tops
where
did
you
get
this
gorgeous
spread
yorke
inquires
the
duke
oh
i
was
out
foraging
early
this
morning
he
says
carelessly
now
miss
leslie
you
are
the
presiding
genius
of
course
the
salt
has
been
forgotten
it
always
is
no
it
has
not
says
leslie
holding
it
up
triumphantly
nothing
has
been
forgotten
you
have
brought
everything
including
an
appetite
he
says
brightly
and
as
he
opens
a
bottle
of
champagne
he
sings
the
foaming
wine
of
southern
france
yes
i
wonder
how
many
persons
who
read
that
in
their
tennyson
realize
that
it
is
champagne
says
the
duke
brightly
they
seat
themselves
cushions
have
been
brought
from
the
wagon
for
leslie
and
the
duke
and
the
feast
begins
some
chicken
miss
leslie
this
is
going
to
be
a
failure
as
a
picnic
it
is
going
to
rain
says
yorke
and
i
rather
miss
the
cow
which
usually
appears
on
the
scene
and
scampers
over
the
pie
says
the
duke
i
suppose
your
grace
manage
a
cow
on
a
tower
yorke
looks
at
him
half
angrily
oh
cut
that
he
mutters
just
loud
enough
to
reach
the
duke
lisle
looks
round
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
i
must
find
a
spot
for
my
sketch
he
says
all
right
presently
says
yorke
pleasure
first
always
as
the
man
said
when
he
killed
the
tax
collector
miss
lisle
have
you
sworn
never
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
of
champagne
but
leslie
shakes
her
head
and
declines
the
offered
bottle
and
her
appetite
is
soon
appeased
shall
we
leave
these
gourmands
and
find
a
particularly
picturesque
study
for
your
father
miss
lisle
suggests
yorke
that
is
if
he
is
bent
on
sketch
he
stops
suddenly
for
a
woman
laugh
has
risen
from
the
green
slope
beneath
them
it
is
not
an
unmusical
laugh
but
it
is
unpleasantly
loud
and
bold
and
the
others
start
slightly
that
is
the
other
party
says
leslie
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
are
not
coming
up
here
if
they
should
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
how
i
look
when
i
scowl
miss
lisle
he
says
leslie
gets
up
and
goes
to
the
battlements
no
they
are
going
round
the
other
side
she
says
heaven
be
thanked
too
soon
she
rejoins
with
a
laugh
they
are
coming
back
what
a
handsome
girl
standing
talking
and
laughing
beneath
her
are
two
men
and
a
girl
the
latter
is
handsome
as
leslie
says
but
there
is
something
in
the
face
which
like
the
laugh
jars
upon
one
she
is
dark
of
a
complexion
that
is
almost
spanish
has
dark
eyes
that
sparkle
and
glitter
in
the
sunlight
and
raven
hair
and
if
the
face
is
not
perfect
in
its
beauty
her
figure
nearly
approaches
the
acme
of
grace
it
is
lithe
slim
mobile
but
it
is
clad
too
fashionably
and
there
is
a
little
too
much
color
about
it
she
stands
laughing
loudly
unconscious
of
the
silent
spectator
above
her
for
a
moment
or
two
then
perhaps
made
aware
by
that
mysterious
sense
which
all
of
us
have
experienced
that
she
is
being
looked
at
she
looks
up
and
the
two
girls
eyes
meet
she
turns
to
say
something
to
her
companions
and
at
that
moment
yorke
joins
leslie
he
looks
down
at
the
group
below
that
the
party
evidently
he
begins
then
he
stops
suddenly
something
like
an
oath
starts
from
his
lips
and
he
puts
his
hand
none
too
gently
on
leslie
arm
come
away
he
says
sharply
and
yet
with
a
touch
of
hoarseness
or
can
it
be
fear
in
his
voice
come
away
miss
lisle
and
leslie
as
she
draws
back
in
instant
obedience
sees
that
his
face
has
become
white
to
the
lips
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
it
must
be
that
of
the
girl
beneath
floats
up
to
them
a
lively
rollicking
voice
singing
this
refined
and
charming
ditty
yes
after
dark
is
the
time
to
lark
although
we
sleep
all
day
to
pass
the
wine
and
do
repine
for
we
up
to
the
time
of
day
dear
boys
we
up
to
the
time
of
day
chapter
ix
the
picnic
as
the
words
of
the
song
rise
on
the
clear
air
leslie
turns
away
no
respectable
woman
could
have
sung
such
a
song
and
she
is
not
surprised
that
her
companion
and
host
has
bidden
her
come
away
she
steps
down
from
the
battlement
in
silence
and
as
she
does
so
glances
at
him
his
face
is
no
longer
pale
but
there
is
a
cloud
upon
it
which
he
is
evidently
trying
to
dispel
she
thinks
not
unreasonably
that
it
is
caused
by
annoyance
that
she
should
have
heard
the
song
and
she
is
grateful
to
him
the
cloud
vanishes
and
his
face
resumes
something
of
its
usual
frank
but
not
quite
all
we
give
those
folks
time
to
get
clear
away
before
we
begin
our
exploration
miss
lisle
he
says
casually
but
with
the
faintest
tone
of
uneasiness
in
his
voice
that
is
the
worst
of
these
show
places
one
is
never
sure
of
one
company
and
are
everywhere
nowadays
why
should
they
not
be
says
leslie
with
a
smile
the
world
is
not
entirely
made
for
nice
people
no
i
suppose
not
he
assents
and
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
say
that
they
had
better
be
here
than
in
some
other
places
and
that
it
might
do
good
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
talked
now
i
not
much
of
a
philanthropist
but
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
good
people
always
say
they
seemed
very
happy
says
leslie
who
he
asks
almost
sharply
oh
those
people
yes
lisle
ought
to
get
a
good
sketch
somewhere
hereabouts
and
he
leads
her
back
to
the
duke
and
lisle
the
duke
looks
up
grey
has
made
a
back
for
him
with
the
cushions
and
the
hampers
and
he
smoking
in
most
unwonted
contentment
back
already
he
says
i
thought
you
had
gone
to
prospect
so
we
had
responds
yorke
but
we
were
alarmed
by
savages
from
a
neighboring
island
he
lights
a
cigar
as
he
speaks
we
are
going
to
give
them
time
to
get
away
in
their
canoes
as
robinson
crusoe
did
you
know
by
the
way
miss
lisle
if
you
will
sit
down
i
will
reconnoiter
and
report
leslie
sinks
down
beside
her
father
and
yorke
strolls
leisurely
to
the
steps
leading
from
the
tower
he
pauses
there
a
moment
or
two
listening
then
goes
down
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
on
the
grassy
slope
he
stops
again
and
the
cloud
comes
on
his
face
darker
than
before
it
must
be
a
mistake
he
mutters
it
could
be
she
and
yet
he
walks
on
a
few
paces
and
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
comes
upon
traces
of
the
savages
a
champagne
bottle
empty
of
course
and
a
newspaper
he
takes
the
latter
up
mechanically
then
unfolds
it
and
turns
to
the
column
of
theatrical
advertisements
and
sees
the
following
diadem
theater
royal
notice
in
consequence
of
serious
indisposition
miss
finetta
will
not
play
this
evening
with
an
exclamation
which
is
very
near
an
oath
he
flings
the
paper
from
him
and
walks
on
and
as
he
goes
round
the
base
of
the
tower
he
is
almost
run
into
by
one
of
the
gentlemen
whom
leslie
saw
with
the
dark
young
lady
of
the
song
they
both
stop
short
and
start
then
the
exclaims
with
a
laugh
hello
auchester
well
i
hush
be
quiet
says
yorke
almost
sternly
and
with
an
upward
glance
eh
says
the
other
what
the
matter
who
the
duse
would
have
expected
to
see
you
here
i
might
say
the
same
retorts
yorke
with
about
as
mirthless
a
smile
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
how
did
you
come
here
why
by
boat
responds
the
other
did
i
tell
you
so
what
have
you
done
with
my
nags
they
are
all
right
says
yorke
come
this
way
will
you
keep
close
to
the
tower
if
you
do
mind
the
young
fellow
follows
him
with
a
air
what
it
all
mean
why
this
mystery
my
dear
boy
he
asks
yorke
having
got
him
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
three
on
the
tower
faces
him
and
instead
of
replying
to
his
question
asks
another
was
that
finetta
with
you
just
now
vinson
yes
says
lord
vinson
at
once
of
course
it
was
did
you
see
her
know
her
yorke
nods
curtly
yes
what
is
she
doing
here
how
did
she
come
here
with
you
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
replies
lord
vinson
after
left
me
this
morning
i
was
wondering
who
i
should
hunt
up
to
come
for
a
sail
when
i
saw
her
coming
down
the
street
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
i
dare
say
well
lord
vinson
looks
rather
aggrieved
at
being
cut
so
short
but
goes
on
enough
she
spotted
me
at
once
and
the
first
question
she
asked
was
had
i
seen
you
well
demands
yorke
as
curtly
as
before
well
i
did
know
what
to
say
for
the
moment
because
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
care
for
her
to
know
a
faint
expression
of
relief
flits
across
yorke
face
but
it
disappears
at
vinson
next
words
she
saw
me
hesitate
and
of
course
knew
that
i
had
seen
you
no
use
your
playing
it
low
down
on
me
my
dear
boy
she
said
laughing
you
know
her
way
could
deceive
a
calf
if
you
tried
you
seen
him
and
he
here
somewhere
it
was
no
use
trying
to
deceive
her
as
she
said
and
i
had
to
own
up
that
i
had
seen
you
this
morning
and
that
you
borrowed
my
rig
yorke
bit
his
lip
and
nodded
impatiently
she
took
it
very
well
she
did
indeed
she
only
laughed
and
said
that
she
knew
you
had
left
town
for
some
fishing
and
being
sick
of
london
herself
she
had
sent
a
certificate
to
say
she
was
down
with
low
or
high
or
some
kind
of
fever
i
forget
which
and
had
to
run
down
here
for
a
bit
of
a
holiday
with
her
brother
or
her
uncle
i
do
know
which
it
is
yorke
looks
round
with
anxiety
oh
it
all
right
says
lord
vinson
they
gone
on
to
the
inn
i
came
back
for
my
stick
there
it
is
well
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
ask
them
to
come
for
a
sail
and
it
took
her
fancy
and
here
we
are
do
you
know
yorke
stands
with
downcast
overclouded
face
and
the
young
viscount
after
regarding
him
attentively
says
look
here
auchester
i
know
what
it
is
you
do
want
to
run
against
her
just
now
got
friends
up
there
eh
and
he
nods
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
tower
no
i
do
not
want
to
see
her
and
i
certainly
do
want
her
to
see
me
assents
yorke
if
you
can
manage
to
take
her
away
vinson
he
lays
his
hand
on
the
young
fellow
shoulder
and
vinson
who
is
never
so
delighted
as
when
doing
a
service
for
his
friend
nods
intelligently
i
see
all
right
you
leave
it
to
me
he
pulls
out
his
watch
get
her
away
at
once
in
fact
it
time
we
started
do
you
be
uneasy
thanks
says
yorke
and
his
brow
lifts
a
little
when
does
she
go
back
she
plays
yorke
brow
clears
completely
and
he
smiles
off
with
you
then
he
says
i
awfully
obliged
to
you
vinson
you
are
right
i
do
want
the
the
people
i
am
with
to
see
her
vinson
looks
up
at
the
tower
curiously
and
rather
wistfully
no
my
dear
boy
i
not
going
to
introduce
you
says
yorke
with
a
smile
i
too
anxious
to
be
rid
of
you
and
her
see
them
safe
on
board
the
train
and
if
anything
occurs
to
prevent
them
going
send
me
a
message
morning
i
give
you
the
address
he
stops
no
never
mind
make
them
go
tell
her
she
lose
her
engagement
anything
but
see
that
she
goes
vinson
grins
i
tell
her
you
gone
back
to
town
he
says
yorke
colors
woodman
spare
the
lie
he
says
with
forced
levity
no
need
to
tell
her
that
no
it
would
do
come
to
think
of
it
she
find
out
i
sold
her
when
she
got
back
and
then
he
whistled
significantly
i
like
finetta
with
her
claws
in
do
you
know
i
think
you
the
only
man
that
not
afraid
of
her
yorke
smiles
again
well
do
what
you
like
he
says
but
go
now
there
a
good
fellow
and
for
heaven
sake
do
let
her
come
this
way
again
we
heard
her
singing
vinson
laughs
yes
if
you
were
within
a
mile
of
her
you
could
help
doing
that
he
says
dryly
well
old
chap
do
trouble
about
the
nags
they
are
all
right
says
yorke
i
bring
them
back
safe
and
sound
when
the
coast
clear
finishes
the
young
fellow
and
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
he
picks
up
his
stick
and
goes
off
yorke
auchester
stands
where
his
friend
has
left
him
and
looks
out
to
sea
with
a
troubled
countenance
stares
so
long
and
so
lost
in
thought
that
it
would
seem
as
if
he
had
forgotten
his
own
party
it
is
not
often
that
the
young
man
has
a
moody
fit
but
he
has
it
now
and
very
badly
but
presently
there
comes
down
to
him
the
faint
sound
of
leslie
soft
musical
laugh
how
striking
a
contrast
to
that
of
the
young
lady
whom
he
has
just
got
rid
of
and
he
wakes
from
his
unpleasant
reverie
and
climbs
up
to
the
tower
the
duke
is
leaning
back
with
an
amused
and
interested
smile
on
his
face
which
is
turned
towards
leslie
and
it
is
evident
that
he
is
happier
and
more
contented
than
usual
miss
lisle
has
just
been
giving
me
a
description
of
the
portmaris
folks
you
have
missed
something
yorke
he
says
with
a
laugh
have
the
savages
disappeared
quite
says
yorke
and
if
miss
lisle
and
her
father
would
like
to
look
round
the
coast
is
now
clear
you
go
papa
says
leslie
with
her
usual
unselfishness
and
i
will
stay
with
mr
temple
the
duke
glances
at
her
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
says
i
am
not
going
to
impose
upon
your
good
nature
miss
lisle
besides
i
dare
say
i
shall
take
forty
winks
leslie
hesitates
a
moment
then
she
gets
up
and
goes
for
the
easel
but
yorke
is
too
quick
for
her
come
along
lisle
he
says
touching
him
on
the
arm
while
he
stands
looking
from
the
edge
of
the
tower
absently
and
the
three
descend
now
this
strikes
me
as
a
good
place
says
yorke
setting
up
the
easel
do
know
much
about
it
you
know
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
outline
and
the
excellent
yes
very
good
assents
the
artist
eagerly
getting
out
his
drawing
paper
yes
i
can
make
a
picture
of
this
you
need
not
wait
he
adds
you
will
want
to
talk
and
i
see
says
yorke
come
along
miss
lisle
we
evidently
not
wanted
they
stroll
away
side
by
side
and
slowly
descend
the
grassy
slope
which
gradually
becomes
broken
by
rock
which
kindly
nature
who
has
always
an
eye
to
effect
has
clothed
with
ferns
and
moss
and
lichen
i
suppose
i
ought
to
show
you
the
hermit
cell
says
leslie
everybody
sees
it
by
all
means
he
assents
but
rather
absently
the
loud
laugh
of
finetta
the
song
are
still
echoing
hideously
in
his
ears
which
hermit
did
you
know
she
says
lightly
stepping
from
stone
to
stone
there
was
a
hermit
here
once
ever
so
long
ago
here
is
his
cell
and
she
stops
before
a
cavity
in
the
rocks
a
deliciously
shady
nook
overhung
with
honeysuckle
and
wild
clematis
which
perfume
the
air
yorke
looks
in
somebody
since
the
hermit
time
had
been
kind
enough
to
fix
a
comfortable
seat
in
the
little
cell
from
which
a
delightful
view
of
the
sea
and
the
cliff
can
be
obtained
let
us
sit
down
while
you
tell
me
about
him
he
says
leslie
seats
herself
and
looks
out
at
the
greenery
at
her
feet
and
blue
of
sea
and
sky
beyond
and
he
takes
his
place
beside
her
but
looks
at
her
instead
of
the
view
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
woman
there
really
was
a
hermit
here
ever
so
long
ago
she
says
dreamily
they
talk
of
him
at
portmaris
even
now
he
was
a
very
great
man
in
his
time
but
i
am
afraid
not
a
very
good
one
it
is
said
that
he
killed
his
best
friend
in
a
duel
and
that
smitten
with
remorse
for
his
crime
and
his
foolish
life
he
vowed
that
he
would
never
set
eyes
on
mortal
man
again
so
he
came
and
lived
in
this
cell
which
he
dug
out
with
his
own
hands
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prayer
and
meditation
every
day
the
village
folks
and
sometimes
the
pilgrims
who
visited
his
shrine
placed
food
on
the
ledge
of
the
little
window
but
though
they
could
hear
his
voice
in
prayer
or
singing
hymns
no
one
ever
saw
his
face
nor
did
he
ever
look
out
upon
those
who
came
to
visit
him
he
must
have
been
fearfully
unhappy
says
yorke
in
a
low
voice
for
the
soft
subdued
tones
seem
to
cast
a
spell
over
him
no
they
say
not
for
he
was
often
heard
especially
after
he
had
been
living
here
for
some
years
to
be
singing
cheerfully
but
that
was
after
he
had
received
his
sign
his
sign
he
asks
yes
he
prayed
that
if
heaven
forgave
him
his
sins
and
accepted
his
penitence
it
would
render
the
birds
tame
enough
to
come
at
his
call
and
did
they
yes
the
pilgrims
to
the
shrine
often
saw
a
thin
hand
thrust
through
the
window
with
a
hedge
sparrow
or
thrush
perched
upon
it
and
the
rabbits
there
were
numbers
of
them
here
would
come
when
he
called
and
let
him
feed
them
with
the
remains
of
his
frugal
fare
one
day
the
village
people
received
no
answer
when
they
called
to
him
not
even
the
which
amply
repaid
them
for
their
pious
charity
they
waited
two
days
and
then
they
entered
the
cell
and
found
him
lying
dead
on
his
stone
pallet
and
a
wild
dove
was
resting
on
his
breast
it
flew
away
as
they
entered
but
it
was
seen
hovering
about
the
cell
for
years
afterward
and
the
portmaris
people
say
that
a
dove
is
always
near
here
even
now
if
yorke
had
read
the
story
of
the
hermit
of
martin
in
a
book
he
did
read
many
books
unfortunately
it
would
not
have
affected
him
at
all
but
told
by
this
lovely
girl
in
a
voice
hushed
with
sympathetic
awe
and
reverence
it
moves
him
strangely
it
a
pity
there
are
not
more
hermits
he
says
a
pity
a
man
leave
the
world
in
which
he
has
made
himself
such
a
nuisance
and
have
a
little
time
to
be
quiet
and
repent
yes
your
grace
assents
leslie
he
looks
at
her
quickly
and
then
away
to
the
sea
again
i
wonder
whether
you
be
offended
if
i
asked
a
favor
of
you
miss
lisle
what
is
it
she
says
lightly
in
the
old
times
the
proper
reply
was
unto
half
my
kingdom
but
i
have
any
kingdom
oh
it
is
much
he
says
i
was
only
going
to
ask
you
if
you
would
be
kind
enough
not
to
address
me
as
grace
leslie
looks
at
him
with
her
slow
smile
and
a
faint
blush
is
it
wrong
she
asks
apologetically
i
did
know
you
see
i
have
not
met
many
dukes
he
strikes
at
the
sandy
pebbles
which
form
the
floor
of
the
good
hermit
cave
with
his
stick
oh
oh
it
right
enough
to
call
a
duke
grace
he
says
hurriedly
but
i
rather
you
did
call
me
so
i
glad
it
was
right
she
rejoins
with
an
air
of
relief
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
committed
some
awful
blunder
no
no
he
says
but
do
please
i
have
a
decided
objection
to
it
you
see
i
rather
a
republican
than
otherwise
everybody
is
a
republican
nowadays
do
you
know
oh
yorke
yorke
there
will
be
no
dukes
or
any
other
titles
presently
but
until
that
time
arrives
what
should
one
call
you
asks
leslie
not
unreasonably
is
lord
right
it
better
he
admits
but
i
do
care
much
about
that
from
friends
you
know
i
afraid
you
think
it
rather
presumptuous
of
me
to
call
you
a
friend
enemy
would
sound
rude
and
ungrateful
after
your
and
kindness
she
says
as
lightly
as
before
my
name
is
yorke
one
of
and
it
the
name
i
like
best
i
dare
say
that
you
have
noticed
that
temple
calls
me
by
it
yes
says
leslie
so
it
sounds
more
familiar
to
me
and
and
nicer
i
suppose
a
man
has
a
right
to
be
called
what
he
likes
i
imagine
so
says
leslie
then
that
a
bargain
he
says
cheerfully
as
if
the
matter
were
disposed
of
this
place
he
goes
on
as
if
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
subject
reminds
me
of
scotland
a
little
bit
you
only
want
a
salmon
river
i
spent
many
a
day
fishing
and
shooting
in
a
solitude
as
complete
as
the
hermit
you
get
scared
at
last
by
the
stillness
and
the
silence
and
begin
to
think
that
all
creation
has
gone
to
sleep
and
are
afraid
to
move
lest
you
should
wake
it
and
then
while
you
stand
quite
still
beside
the
stream
something
comes
flitting
down
the
mountain
side
something
with
great
antlers
and
big
mournful
eyes
and
it
steps
into
the
water
close
beside
you
and
takes
a
drink
looking
round
watchfully
then
up
you
jump
and
give
a
shout
and
away
the
stag
goes
and
all
creation
awake
again
it
is
leslie
turn
to
listen
now
and
she
does
so
with
lips
then
at
night
you
go
out
with
a
gun
and
you
lie
down
flat
amongst
the
bracken
and
keep
your
eyes
open
and
after
a
while
when
you
are
just
feeling
tired
of
it
and
thinking
what
an
idiot
you
are
not
to
be
in
bed
or
at
any
rate
beside
a
cozy
fire
with
a
pipe
you
hear
a
flap
flap
in
the
air
and
a
couple
of
heron
come
sailing
between
you
and
the
moon
and
you
raise
your
gun
carefully
and
quietly
awfully
sharp
chap
the
heron
and
down
comes
one
of
and
perhaps
if
you
have
any
luck
the
other
with
the
second
barrel
then
you
load
up
again
and
wait
and
after
a
time
if
your
luck
holds
good
a
flush
of
wild
duck
come
flipperty
flopperty
above
your
head
and
you
bring
one
or
two
of
them
down
and
all
the
time
the
stream
ripples
and
babbles
on
and
the
soft
wind
plays
through
the
pines
and
he
stops
with
a
laugh
and
that
peculiar
look
which
expresses
shyness
in
a
man
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
i
mean
i
must
be
boring
you
to
death
no
you
were
not
says
leslie
quietly
and
with
a
little
sigh
i
forgot
that
ladies
do
care
for
sport
except
hunting
some
of
them
they
like
to
hear
about
london
and
all
the
gossip
there
leslie
shakes
her
head
i
afraid
i
very
singular
then
she
says
for
i
would
rather
hear
about
fishing
and
shooting
if
it
is
all
like
that
you
have
been
telling
me
of
but
it
is
he
says
with
a
laugh
sometimes
the
birds
do
come
and
the
fish
wo
rise
and
instead
of
catching
any
you
catch
a
cold
and
then
you
go
back
to
london
and
swear
that
it
the
best
place
after
all
but
after
a
little
while
you
get
sick
of
it
again
and
think
if
you
could
only
get
on
to
a
scotch
moor
you
be
happy
man
never
is
but
always
to
be
blest
says
leslie
yes
because
men
are
such
fools
that
they
spoil
their
lives
before
they
know
where
they
are
he
says
i
once
saw
a
man
try
to
swim
across
the
thames
for
a
wager
with
a
weight
round
his
neck
he
would
have
been
drowned
if
they
had
picked
him
up
pretty
smartly
it
the
same
in
life
he
stops
suddenly
and
laughs
rather
shortly
we
get
on
to
a
more
cheerful
topic
there
a
hawk
see
and
he
points
to
a
bird
circling
in
the
vault
of
blue
i
was
wondering
what
it
was
says
leslie
you
must
have
good
eyes
do
you
know
all
the
birds
when
you
see
them
nearly
all
i
think
he
replies
horses
and
dogs
and
birds
i
know
a
little
about
but
i
do
know
anything
else
i
think
i
should
have
made
a
decent
gamekeeper
or
horse
breaker
i
not
fit
for
anything
else
but
sometimes
i
console
myself
with
something
i
read
in
the
paper
the
other
day
the
fellow
said
that
there
were
far
too
many
clever
people
in
the
world
and
that
very
soon
it
would
be
quite
a
distinction
not
to
have
painted
a
picture
or
written
a
book
or
done
something
in
the
scientific
way
i
on
the
safe
road
to
distinction
miss
lisle
there
is
a
bigger
dunce
in
portmaris
than
i
am
so
they
talk
it
is
not
much
it
is
neither
witty
nor
wise
it
is
just
the
pleasant
aimless
chatter
of
two
young
people
who
are
almost
strangers
and
yet
so
absorbed
and
interested
are
they
that
they
do
not
note
how
time
flies
that
the
sun
is
sinking
in
the
west
and
that
the
shadows
are
stealing
over
hill
and
dale
leslie
is
perfectly
at
her
ease
she
has
almost
forgotten
quite
forgotten
for
the
time
indeed
that
the
young
man
sitting
beside
her
with
his
arms
folded
behind
his
head
and
talking
of
his
fishing
and
his
shooting
and
of
the
strange
beasts
and
birds
and
fishes
he
has
seen
killed
or
captured
is
a
duke
and
he
yorke
always
ready
to
be
happy
to
meet
the
sweet
goddess
happiness
is
filled
with
a
strange
feeling
of
peace
that
yet
is
not
peace
which
at
times
almost
startles
him
in
all
his
life
he
has
not
met
with
a
girl
like
this
so
simple
yet
so
sweetly
wise
so
good
and
yet
so
bright
and
winsome
he
is
beginning
to
know
some
of
the
multitudinous
expressions
of
the
beautiful
face
to
lay
traps
for
the
slow
smile
to
set
snares
for
drawing
the
clear
darkly
gray
eyes
toward
his
that
he
may
look
into
their
depths
her
voice
makes
sweet
melody
in
his
ears
and
stirs
his
heart
with
a
vague
thrill
which
will
trouble
him
presently
trouble
him
very
much
it
seems
to
him
one
moment
that
he
has
known
her
for
years
the
next
that
she
has
just
lighted
from
the
clouds
or
risen
from
the
depths
of
the
blue
sea
and
that
he
shall
never
know
her
or
get
any
nearer
to
her
and
under
the
influence
of
these
sensations
which
summed
up
as
a
whole
are
as
a
potent
spell
he
forgets
the
dark
girl
whom
he
has
persuaded
vinson
to
take
away
out
of
sight
forgets
the
compact
that
he
has
made
with
the
duke
forgets
that
he
is
sailing
under
false
colors
and
is
deceiving
the
girl
beside
him
forgets
in
short
everything
save
that
she
is
beside
him
and
that
he
has
the
delight
of
looking
at
and
talking
to
and
ah
best
of
all
of
listening
to
her
he
would
be
content
to
sit
there
so
that
she
were
by
his
side
till
the
end
of
the
world
but
a
shadow
falling
across
the
entrance
to
the
hut
rouses
leslie
to
a
sense
of
the
flight
of
the
common
enemy
why
it
must
be
late
she
says
with
the
air
of
one
making
a
great
discovery
is
it
he
says
must
we
really
go
it
is
very
jolly
here
it
is
as
jolly
as
it
was
last
night
on
the
water
but
he
gets
up
and
follows
her
and
they
make
their
way
back
as
they
emerge
on
the
they
find
that
the
wind
has
dropped
and
is
sighing
across
the
downs
rather
plaintively
and
yorke
looking
up
sees
a
cloud
which
though
it
is
not
much
bigger
than
a
man
hand
is
full
of
warning
did
you
happen
to
bring
an
umbrella
with
you
he
asks
with
affected
carelessness
leslie
laughs
not
even
a
sunshade
why
nothing
he
says
inwardly
calling
himself
opprobrious
names
for
not
providing
the
englishman
traveling
companion
do
you
think
it
is
going
to
rain
she
asks
oh
no
it
possible
everything
is
possible
in
this
charming
climate
of
ours
he
says
well
lisle
how
are
you
getting
on
he
asks
as
they
go
up
to
the
artist
still
hard
at
work
he
looks
up
with
a
start
to
him
they
have
only
been
absent
say
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
is
difficult
he
says
very
one
needs
time
time
we
better
come
another
day
says
yorke
oh
you
have
got
on
famously
and
he
keeps
his
countenance
capitally
as
he
looks
at
the
sketch
i
carry
your
easel
and
he
folds
it
up
and
puts
it
over
his
shoulder
they
find
the
duke
waiting
for
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
tower
and
seeing
them
all
together
he
does
not
suspect
that
the
two
young
people
have
been
spending
the
whole
afternoon
i
was
just
going
off
without
you
he
says
addressing
all
three
but
looking
at
leslie
face
which
wears
a
rapt
and
dreamy
expression
it
well
you
did
retorts
yorke
you
and
grey
would
never
have
reached
home
alive
miss
leslie
and
i
are
the
only
persons
who
can
manage
these
nags
but
come
on
and
he
glances
upward
that
cloud
has
grown
considerably
since
they
left
the
hermit
hut
and
leads
the
way
to
the
inn
now
he
says
to
the
landlady
in
his
frank
and
genial
way
got
the
kettle
boiling
right
let
us
have
some
tea
while
the
horses
are
being
put
to
then
he
goes
round
to
the
stable
inspects
the
horses
and
is
back
in
time
to
hand
leslie
a
cup
of
the
beverage
which
be
the
hour
what
it
may
is
always
welcomed
by
fair
women
now
up
you
get
he
says
after
surreptitiously
tipping
everybody
landlord
hostler
maid
all
round
miss
leslie
we
ca
get
on
without
you
in
front
you
know
he
remarks
as
leslie
is
about
to
go
inside
and
he
helps
her
to
the
box
the
horses
are
fresh
and
eager
for
work
and
for
a
time
he
drives
but
presently
he
puts
the
reins
in
her
hands
according
to
promise
he
says
hold
tight
while
i
and
he
bends
down
and
searches
for
something
under
the
box
seat
oh
how
beautifully
they
go
she
says
half
to
herself
what
is
it
you
are
looking
for
your
gra
lord
yorke
never
you
mind
he
says
you
look
after
your
horses
leslie
laughs
and
laughs
again
as
he
comes
up
red
in
the
face
and
with
a
scotch
wrap
in
his
hand
are
you
so
cold
she
asks
very
he
responds
it
going
to
snow
i
fancy
why
it
is
quite
close
she
says
removing
her
eyes
for
a
moment
from
the
horses
to
glance
at
him
with
smiling
surprise
it
seems
hotter
than
it
has
been
all
day
as
she
speaks
a
low
rumbling
rolls
over
their
heads
and
a
flash
of
light
cuts
across
the
sky
that
is
lightning
she
exclaims
it
was
rather
like
it
he
admits
dryly
did
you
bring
any
gamps
asks
the
duke
nary
one
replies
yorke
grimly
slang
away
i
can
bear
it
and
i
deserve
it
he
mutters
glancing
at
the
girlish
figure
beside
him
lisle
looks
round
absently
i
afraid
it
it
is
going
to
rain
he
says
in
another
minute
it
is
raining
yorke
takes
the
rug
in
both
hands
and
deftly
wraps
it
round
leslie
oh
no
please
she
says
and
she
glances
behind
her
give
it
to
him
mr
temple
it
would
be
more
than
my
life
is
worth
he
says
i
dare
not
offer
it
to
him
please
let
me
fasten
it
how
shall
i
give
me
a
hairpin
you
must
hold
the
horses
then
she
says
i
can
see
one
sticking
out
he
says
well
take
it
she
responds
innocently
and
all
unconsciously
for
she
is
thinking
of
her
driving
far
more
than
the
rain
or
the
rug
or
anything
else
he
looks
at
her
intent
and
absorbed
face
and
puts
up
his
hand
and
draws
the
hairpin
from
its
soft
and
silken
nest
and
she
unheeding
does
not
know
that
his
hand
trembles
actually
trembles
as
he
fastens
the
rug
round
her
now
give
me
the
reins
he
says
and
keep
your
head
down
we
are
in
for
a
regular
storm
as
he
speaks
the
rain
comes
down
with
a
whiz
as
if
it
meant
to
wash
them
off
the
box
leslie
laughs
after
all
it
is
a
proper
picnic
she
says
but
the
next
instant
her
laugh
dies
away
for
the
heavens
seem
to
open
before
them
a
peal
of
thunder
roars
like
the
discharge
of
a
park
of
artillery
just
above
their
heads
and
the
horses
startled
and
frightened
stop
dead
short
then
rear
up
on
end
the
carriage
sways
and
for
a
moment
it
seems
as
if
it
were
going
over
and
leslie
is
forced
up
close
against
yorke
he
holds
the
terrified
horses
with
one
strong
hand
against
him
all
right
he
says
in
a
low
voice
do
be
afraid
leslie
his
arm
holds
her
supports
her
presses
her
to
him
perhaps
unconsciously
you
are
quite
safe
dearest
dearest
low
as
his
voice
is
leslie
hears
him
or
she
asks
herself
is
it
only
fancy
for
a
moment
one
brief
moment
she
cowers
nestling
to
him
her
face
hidden
against
his
shoulder
then
with
a
start
she
draws
away
and
with
her
face
red
and
white
by
turns
looks
straight
before
her
and
through
the
roar
of
thunder
and
the
hissing
of
the
rain
she
hears
those
words
leslie
dearest
dearest
chapter
yorke
in
love
the
great
changes
of
our
lives
come
suddenly
swift
as
the
flash
is
the
revelation
to
yorke
that
he
loves
the
girl
who
sits
beside
him
he
had
uttered
the
words
which
are
still
ringing
in
her
ears
but
he
knows
that
his
heart
has
been
saying
dearest
all
day
long
he
knows
now
what
that
strange
peaceful
happiness
meant
which
made
him
feel
as
if
he
would
be
content
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
life
by
her
side
in
the
hermit
cell
and
he
knows
that
this
is
no
transient
passion
which
will
have
its
day
and
pass
leaving
not
a
wreck
behind
as
so
many
passions
alas
have
passed
with
him
to
every
one
of
the
sons
of
men
it
is
said
comes
once
in
his
life
the
great
love
which
wipes
out
all
others
and
which
shall
make
of
all
his
days
an
endless
misery
or
a
surpassing
happiness
and
this
love
has
come
to
yorke
in
an
instant
as
it
were
it
seems
to
have
wrought
a
change
in
him
gay
reckless
thoughtless
an
hour
ago
he
is
serious
enough
now
his
heart
is
beating
quickly
furiously
his
strong
hands
tremble
as
he
holds
the
terrified
horses
and
urges
them
on
with
whip
and
voice
and
yet
though
apparently
engrossed
with
them
thinking
more
of
the
silent
girl
beside
him
she
is
so
silent
she
scarcely
seems
to
move
but
sits
with
the
rug
concealing
her
face
her
head
bent
down
what
have
i
said
he
asks
himself
in
truth
he
scarcely
knows
it
is
as
if
his
heart
had
suddenly
become
the
master
of
his
voice
and
actions
and
had
made
a
helpless
slave
of
him
if
she
would
only
speak
he
longs
past
all
description
to
hear
her
voice
even
though
it
should
be
in
anger
and
indignation
but
she
does
not
speak
he
lifts
his
face
to
the
sweeping
rain
and
almost
welcomes
it
the
storm
is
in
harmony
with
the
tempest
of
awakened
passion
which
rages
in
his
breast
he
does
not
dare
to
speak
to
her
scarcely
ventures
to
look
her
way
and
he
sits
as
silent
as
herself
while
the
horses
dash
along
the
streaming
road
and
up
the
portmaris
street
we
might
have
come
by
boat
there
is
water
enough
says
the
duke
dryly
miss
lisle
i
am
afraid
you
are
wet
through
pray
get
in
at
once
or
you
will
catch
cold
she
stands
up
on
the
box
and
yorke
goes
to
unfasten
the
wrap
but
she
is
too
quick
for
him
and
taking
out
the
hairpin
lets
the
rug
fall
and
stands
before
his
eyes
her
slim
graceful
figure
swayed
a
little
away
from
him
as
if
she
did
not
want
him
to
touch
her
he
gets
down
and
offers
her
his
hand
but
she
springs
from
the
box
lightly
stands
a
moment
then
with
a
and
thank
you
follows
her
father
into
the
house
the
duke
looks
after
her
the
poor
child
is
wet
through
and
chilled
he
says
sympathetically
it
a
pity
you
did
think
of
a
mackintosh
yorke
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
rig
and
horses
yorke
looks
down
at
him
as
if
he
scarcely
heard
or
understood
for
a
moment
then
he
says
absently
like
a
man
only
half
recovered
from
a
stunning
blow
the
horses
oh
i
find
a
place
for
them
you
might
take
them
to
the
station
your
grace
they
could
put
them
up
there
in
the
good
stable
suggests
grey
yes
yes
and
look
sharp
says
the
duke
we
have
some
dinner
by
the
time
you
are
back
will
you
have
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
before
you
go
but
yorke
shakes
his
head
almost
impatiently
i
all
right
he
says
curtly
and
he
drives
off
he
sees
the
horses
made
comfortable
in
the
stable
at
the
station
and
helps
to
rub
them
down
and
litter
them
then
he
turns
back
but
at
the
top
of
the
street
he
pauses
he
can
not
face
the
duke
just
yet
there
is
that
in
his
face
in
his
voice
he
knows
which
will
reveal
his
secret
he
turns
off
to
the
right
and
makes
his
way
along
a
little
used
road
toward
the
sea
he
is
wet
through
but
he
does
not
notice
it
he
scarcely
knows
where
he
is
going
until
he
stands
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
i
love
her
he
murmurs
yes
i
love
her
there
is
no
woman
in
all
the
world
like
her
so
good
so
gentle
so
beautiful
he
thinks
of
all
the
girls
he
has
seen
talked
with
danced
with
and
flirted
with
but
there
is
none
like
leslie
i
am
a
lost
man
if
i
do
not
get
her
he
says
to
himself
and
how
can
i
get
her
he
groans
and
pushes
his
hat
off
his
brow
that
is
hot
and
burning
she
cares
nothing
for
me
why
should
she
if
i
was
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
my
wife
how
can
i
and
he
shudders
as
if
some
black
thought
had
swept
down
upon
him
and
crushed
the
hope
out
of
him
how
can
i
oh
what
a
mad
senseless
fool
i
have
been
how
we
chuck
our
lives
away
to
find
out
when
it
is
too
late
what
it
is
we
lost
if
i
had
met
her
a
year
ago
he
breaks
off
and
sighs
as
he
tramps
up
and
down
in
the
rain
if
i
could
only
wipe
out
that
year
but
i
ca
i
ca
though
i
give
ten
years
of
the
life
that
left
in
me
to
be
able
to
do
it
what
would
she
think
say
if
she
knew
if
i
told
her
with
all
her
sweet
childlike
ways
and
all
her
innocence
and
purity
she
is
a
woman
and
the
very
goodness
for
which
i
love
her
would
fight
against
me
she
looked
and
spoke
like
an
angel
when
she
was
telling
me
that
story
about
the
hermit
an
angel
i
a
nice
kind
of
man
to
fall
in
love
with
an
angel
and
want
to
marry
her
i
might
as
well
fall
in
love
with
one
of
those
stars
and
he
looks
up
despairingly
at
the
diamond
lights
that
are
peering
through
the
rift
in
the
clouds
besides
he
mutters
even
if
if
that
other
woman
were
in
the
question
and
he
sets
his
teeth
how
could
i
ask
her
to
marry
me
even
if
she
have
me
and
why
should
i
dare
to
think
that
i
could
win
her
love
i
a
pauper
and
worse
and
she
thinks
me
a
duke
another
thing
i
forgot
that
idiotic
business
oh
i
tied
myself
up
in
every
way
and
have
a
chance
and
yet
i
love
her
i
love
her
leslie
he
repeats
the
name
as
romeo
might
have
repeated
juliet
finding
a
torturing
joy
in
its
music
no
there
no
hope
yorke
my
boy
you
are
badly
hit
you
laughed
at
this
kind
of
thing
often
enough
but
your
turn
has
come
and
as
there
is
no
hope
for
you
you
have
got
to
bear
it
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
clear
out
in
the
morning
and
blot
portmaris
out
of
the
map
of
england
i
must
see
her
again
never
again
all
his
nature
protests
against
this
resolve
and
his
heart
aches
badly
very
badly
but
he
squares
his
shoulders
and
sets
his
teeth
hard
yes
that
the
only
thing
to
do
to
cut
and
run
there
one
comfort
she
wo
mind
she
wo
miss
me
god
knows
what
i
said
when
i
felt
her
face
against
my
breast
but
whatever
it
was
i
offended
her
past
forgiveness
she
would
see
me
again
i
dare
say
if
i
stayed
and
so
he
heaves
a
sigh
which
is
very
much
like
a
groan
and
turns
homeward
he
finds
grey
alone
in
the
room
when
he
enters
the
dinner
things
are
still
on
the
table
and
grey
looks
at
him
with
a
rather
grave
and
startled
expression
i
saved
some
dinner
your
grace
he
says
grace
be
da
hanged
says
yorke
almost
fiercely
yes
my
lord
murmurs
grey
the
duke
waited
for
over
an
hour
and
he
has
gone
to
bed
i
was
afraid
of
a
chill
my
lord
and
your
lordship
is
wet
very
wet
still
all
right
says
yorke
as
politely
as
he
can
never
mind
go
and
see
after
the
duke
and
dinner
oh
yes
thanks
you
need
not
wait
he
tries
to
eat
but
for
once
his
faithful
appetite
fails
him
and
he
pushes
his
plate
away
and
gets
his
pipe
that
great
consoler
in
all
times
of
trouble
and
this
is
the
worst
trouble
yorke
auchester
has
ever
had
it
is
well
on
into
the
small
hours
when
weary
but
oppressed
by
a
ghastly
wakefulness
he
goes
to
bed
and
there
he
lies
and
thoughtful
until
the
sun
floods
the
room
he
gets
up
and
as
he
looks
in
the
glass
after
his
bath
he
smiles
grimly
only
one
night
of
it
he
says
and
a
great
many
similar
ones
lie
before
me
before
i
get
over
this
i
wonder
whether
she
has
been
thinking
of
me
why
should
she
and
if
she
should
have
been
they
would
be
pleasant
thoughts
he
pulls
the
blinds
aside
and
looks
at
the
house
opposite
wondering
which
is
her
window
and
as
he
does
so
the
lover
for
a
sight
of
his
loved
one
assails
him
it
has
still
strong
possession
of
him
when
he
goes
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
street
but
he
fights
against
it
the
best
thing
he
can
do
is
not
to
see
leslie
lisle
but
to
drive
vinson
horses
back
to
northcliffe
and
take
the
train
from
there
to
london
and
stop
there
stop
there
till
in
a
round
of
the
folly
which
has
suddenly
grown
so
senseless
and
worthless
in
his
eyes
he
has
dulled
the
pain
of
this
his
first
real
love
it
is
early
but
portmaris
is
alive
and
very
much
in
evidence
the
fishermen
are
out
on
the
beach
the
women
are
bustling
about
the
children
are
playing
in
the
some
with
a
huge
slice
of
bread
and
butter
or
treacle
in
their
fists
breakfast
is
evidently
a
very
movable
feast
with
the
entire
population
yorke
stands
a
moment
and
looks
round
with
a
pang
of
regret
i
shall
think
of
this
place
he
says
think
of
it
too
often
to
be
comfortable
why
could
i
have
come
here
and
to
her
a
year
ago
what
that
song
about
might
have
been
that
how
i
feel
this
morning
oh
lord
he
strides
on
with
his
head
drooping
in
an
attitude
very
unlike
that
of
yorke
auchester
usual
one
and
without
the
last
night
opera
song
on
his
lips
as
is
ordinarily
the
case
and
he
is
near
the
station
when
he
hears
the
laughter
of
children
ahead
of
him
and
looking
up
sees
a
group
that
make
his
heart
leap
and
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
under
a
great
oak
in
the
pretty
lane
stands
no
other
than
leslie
herself
with
a
child
upheld
in
her
arms
and
two
others
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
her
pretty
simple
morning
dress
the
child
borne
aloft
has
pulled
off
her
hat
and
the
sunlight
as
it
comes
through
the
trees
falls
in
flecks
of
light
and
shadow
on
her
hair
and
upturned
face
she
is
laughing
the
soft
sweet
laugh
which
though
he
should
live
to
be
as
old
as
the
old
man
walking
along
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
yorke
will
never
forget
and
she
does
not
see
him
shall
he
turn
and
go
back
go
back
and
leave
her
forever
better
but
he
can
not
simply
can
not
so
he
goes
on
slowly
and
it
is
not
until
he
is
close
behind
her
that
she
hears
him
she
turns
the
child
still
held
crowing
and
struggling
in
her
arms
and
a
startled
look
comes
into
her
eyes
and
the
color
flies
to
her
face
and
then
leaves
it
pale
yorke
lifts
his
hat
he
says
her
lips
move
and
her
head
bends
over
the
child
now
lying
in
her
arms
and
staring
with
blue
eyes
up
at
the
big
man
who
dares
to
address
miss
lethlie
leslie
lips
move
no
doubt
she
says
in
response
though
he
can
not
hear
her
you
are
early
this
morning
he
says
and
he
knows
that
his
voice
falters
and
sounds
unnatural
as
surely
as
he
knows
that
his
heart
is
beating
like
a
and
that
the
longing
to
cry
to
her
leslie
i
love
you
is
almost
irresistible
yes
she
says
it
is
so
beautiful
after
the
rain
she
stops
for
the
word
has
recalled
that
homeward
drive
the
storm
his
words
all
that
she
has
been
thinking
of
through
the
long
night
yes
he
says
vaguely
stupidly
then
he
says
suddenly
that
child
is
too
heavy
for
you
oh
no
i
often
carry
it
she
falters
bending
still
lower
over
the
pretty
face
enshrined
in
the
yellow
curls
but
it
is
he
says
let
me
take
it
if
it
must
be
carried
she
would
not
let
you
she
says
we
see
he
rejoins
scarcely
knowing
what
he
is
saying
and
he
holds
out
his
arms
the
mite
stares
at
him
turns
and
clutches
leslie
for
a
moment
then
with
the
fickleness
of
its
sex
swings
round
and
holds
out
its
arms
to
him
yorke
laughs
and
holds
it
up
above
his
head
now
what
shall
i
do
with
you
he
says
hurriedly
take
you
to
london
with
me
no
for
the
child
struggles
for
that
is
where
i
am
going
he
puts
the
child
down
and
it
toddles
off
with
the
other
two
yes
i
am
going
to
london
miss
lisle
he
goes
on
trying
to
speak
lightly
carelessly
yes
she
says
with
downcast
eyes
and
she
stoops
to
pick
up
her
hat
as
she
does
so
he
stoops
too
they
get
hold
of
it
together
and
their
hands
meet
but
for
that
sudden
meeting
that
touch
of
her
hand
he
could
have
gone
and
the
history
of
leslie
lisle
would
have
been
a
very
different
one
but
it
is
the
link
which
the
fates
have
been
wanting
to
make
their
chain
complete
leslie
he
cries
scarcely
above
his
breath
leslie
and
he
takes
both
her
hands
and
holds
them
fast
and
looks
into
her
eyes
the
dark
gray
eyes
which
she
lifts
to
him
with
a
swift
fear
or
is
it
a
swift
joy
mirrored
in
their
clear
depths
let
me
go
she
falters
with
trembling
lips
no
he
says
desperately
not
till
i
have
told
you
that
i
love
you
chapter
xi
an
impetuous
avowal
i
love
you
leslie
draws
her
hands
from
his
grasp
and
stands
with
averted
face
her
bosom
heaving
her
breath
coming
with
difficulty
it
is
so
sudden
so
swift
this
declaration
that
she
is
overwhelmed
the
heart
of
a
innocent
girl
is
not
unlike
a
fortress
it
withstands
many
an
attack
and
is
able
to
repulse
the
besiegers
until
the
one
comes
who
cries
surrender
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
before
some
nameless
magic
in
his
presence
her
strength
goes
the
gate
is
thrown
wide
open
and
the
conqueror
marches
in
leslie
had
been
calm
and
enough
when
ralph
duncombe
was
pleading
his
passionate
love
and
was
able
to
withstand
his
urgent
prayer
but
to
yorke
she
can
find
nothing
to
say
she
can
only
stand
with
downcast
eyes
her
heart
beating
fast
and
the
gates
beginning
to
open
he
takes
her
hand
but
again
she
draws
it
from
him
and
sinking
on
to
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
keeps
her
face
her
eyes
from
him
you
are
angry
he
says
his
usually
light
and
careless
voice
deep
and
earnest
enough
now
well
i
deserve
that
i
i
ought
not
to
have
told
you
so
suddenly
but
he
leans
against
a
tree
close
beside
her
and
looks
down
at
her
but
well
i
could
help
it
i
was
going
away
this
morning
his
heart
gives
a
little
quiver
i
was
going
away
from
portmaris
and
from
you
i
been
thinking
of
you
all
night
and
i
decided
that
that
was
the
best
thing
to
do
it
sudden
and
and
startling
to
you
leslie
miss
lisle
but
it
does
seem
so
to
me
you
see
i
suppose
i
have
been
getting
to
love
you
ever
since
i
saw
you
on
the
beach
that
not
long
ago
i
dare
say
you
say
but
it
seems
a
long
time
to
me
months
ages
it
is
almost
as
if
her
own
heart
were
speaking
it
is
just
as
she
has
felt
she
listens
in
a
kind
of
amazement
at
the
subtle
sympathy
between
them
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
but
you
since
i
saw
you
i
know
that
i
shall
be
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
if
if
you
let
me
go
on
loving
you
and
try
to
love
me
a
little
in
return
and
the
most
wretched
beggar
in
existence
if
if
you
ca
he
waits
a
moment
for
a
strange
sensation
comes
in
his
throat
and
stops
his
speech
usually
so
fluent
and
so
free
then
she
still
remaining
silent
he
goes
on
with
the
same
grave
earnest
tone
and
with
the
same
tremor
in
his
voice
i
never
seen
any
one
like
you
i
know
plenty
of
women
but
none
like
you
leslie
i
beg
your
pardon
you
see
i
always
think
of
you
as
leslie
if
i
were
to
try
and
tell
you
how
i
feel
i
should
make
a
mess
of
it
i
can
only
say
that
i
love
you
i
love
you
with
all
his
ignorance
and
lack
of
eloquence
he
is
wise
i
love
you
sums
up
all
a
woman
wants
or
cares
to
hear
of
course
he
goes
on
in
a
lower
voice
daunted
by
her
silence
her
motionless
downcast
face
her
hidden
eyes
of
course
i
ca
expect
do
expect
you
to
understand
or
or
to
care
for
me
even
a
little
you
have
known
me
long
enough
or
or
anything
about
me
all
i
want
is
a
little
hope
if
you
do
dislike
me
right
down
dislike
me
i
be
glad
enough
and
i
try
and
get
you
to
love
me
a
little
you
love
me
as
i
love
you
that
is
to
be
thought
of
is
it
not
she
thinks
but
she
says
nothing
up
above
their
heads
a
thrush
is
singing
melodiously
and
the
liquid
notes
seem
to
say
quite
plainly
i
love
you
the
sun
as
it
shines
between
the
leaves
of
the
old
oak
and
touches
yorke
brave
and
eager
face
is
surely
smiling
he
loves
you
the
stream
rippling
in
a
hollow
behind
them
as
it
runs
laughing
down
to
the
sea
is
as
certainly
murmuring
love
love
love
you
are
angry
and
and
offended
he
says
after
a
pause
during
which
she
has
been
listening
to
this
harmony
of
nature
voices
well
i
deserve
it
i
ought
to
have
waited
until
you
knew
more
of
me
but
you
see
as
i
said
i
could
not
keep
it
i
had
been
thinking
of
you
dreaming
of
you
all
night
and
then
i
saw
you
suddenly
and
i
felt
as
if
i
must
speak
happen
what
might
if
i
had
seen
you
i
dare
say
i
could
have
found
heart
enough
to
clear
out
and
and
hold
my
tongue
but
when
i
saw
you
with
that
little
one
in
your
arms
looking
so
beautiful
and
so
good
just
the
leslie
i
love
so
dearly
the
words
rushed
out
almost
before
i
knew
it
and
and
he
squares
his
broad
chest
and
tilts
his
hat
back
with
a
gesture
which
unlike
most
gestures
fits
him
like
a
glove
there
it
is
she
does
not
lift
her
face
does
not
open
the
lips
that
are
trembling
if
he
could
only
see
it
and
he
waits
a
moment
before
he
says
sadly
with
the
lover
despairing
note
audible
through
an
affected
cheerfulness
i
i
sorry
that
i
made
a
nuisance
of
myself
and
and
worried
you
do
be
upset
and
think
anything
of
it
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
i
could
help
loving
you
but
i
might
have
had
the
sense
to
hold
my
tongue
and
taken
myself
off
without
distressing
you
do
do
think
any
more
of
it
i
not
worthy
of
you
not
worth
a
thought
from
such
as
you
and
well
i
say
miss
lisle
he
puts
his
hat
straight
and
braces
himself
together
so
to
speak
for
the
parting
then
he
bends
down
and
takes
her
hand
the
hand
that
lies
in
the
lap
of
the
pretty
morning
frock
like
a
white
flower
she
does
not
draw
it
away
now
and
as
he
holds
it
the
passion
which
raises
men
to
a
level
with
the
gods
takes
possession
of
him
leslie
he
says
almost
hoarsely
i
ca
let
you
go
i
love
you
too
much
look
at
me
speak
to
me
unless
you
hate
me
i
must
stay
and
try
and
make
you
love
me
i
ca
lose
you
you
are
the
only
woman
i
have
ever
seen
or
known
that
i
wanted
badly
and
i
do
want
you
i
ca
live
without
you
i
ca
leave
you
knowing
that
i
may
never
see
you
again
i
ca
look
up
leslie
dearest
dearest
tell
me
straight
once
and
for
all
i
will
never
come
back
to
worry
you
once
and
for
all
will
you
try
and
love
me
he
takes
her
other
hand
he
has
got
both
now
and
lifts
her
actually
lifts
her
from
the
tree
she
does
not
resist
him
but
lets
her
hands
trembling
remain
willing
prisoners
and
when
her
face
is
on
a
level
with
his
she
raises
her
eyes
and
looks
at
him
there
must
be
something
in
the
dark
gray
eyes
something
under
the
shadow
of
the
black
lashes
which
contains
a
potent
magic
for
at
sight
of
it
his
heart
leaps
and
the
blood
rushes
to
his
face
then
leaves
it
pale
with
the
intensity
of
a
supreme
emotion
an
incredible
joy
an
amazed
delight
leslie
breaks
from
him
leslie
her
eyes
meet
his
steadily
yet
shyly
with
the
secret
which
a
maiden
keeps
hugs
closely
while
she
can
a
secret
which
she
is
loth
to
part
with
but
which
the
loved
one
eyes
read
so
quickly
leslie
do
you
ah
dearest
dearest
you
do
love
me
she
tries
to
withstand
him
to
draw
away
from
him
even
now
but
his
passion
is
too
much
for
her
and
the
next
instant
she
is
folded
in
his
arms
and
her
head
lies
on
his
breast
sing
on
happy
thrush
but
no
music
even
your
velvet
throat
can
make
shall
compare
with
the
music
ringing
through
these
two
human
hearts
a
music
which
shall
not
die
though
these
same
hearts
may
be
torn
apart
and
wrung
with
anguish
a
music
which
for
joy
or
pain
weal
or
woe
shall
echo
through
their
lives
till
death
comes
with
its
great
silence
but
it
is
of
life
and
love
and
joy
and
not
death
or
parting
that
they
are
thinking
now
he
draws
her
arm
within
his
as
if
she
had
belonged
to
him
for
years
or
rather
as
if
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
she
belonged
to
him
and
they
pace
slowly
along
the
meadow
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
her
hat
swings
on
her
hand
her
eyes
lift
heavy
with
love
to
his
face
as
he
bends
down
to
her
his
own
eloquent
with
the
devotion
and
adoration
which
fill
his
heart
to
overflowing
and
yet
through
all
the
storm
of
passion
that
tosses
in
his
breast
he
has
sense
enough
to
notice
how
beautiful
she
is
how
lightly
and
gracefully
she
walks
by
his
side
how
delicious
is
the
pose
of
the
slender
neck
the
half
averted
face
this
flower
that
he
has
found
and
plucked
to
wear
in
his
breast
is
no
common
weed
but
a
rare
blossom
of
which
an
emperor
might
be
proud
and
she
well
she
scarcely
realizes
yet
what
this
is
that
has
happened
to
her
she
only
knows
that
a
supreme
happiness
a
novel
joy
so
intense
as
to
be
almost
pain
is
thrilling
through
her
that
at
one
moment
she
feels
inclined
to
cry
and
the
next
to
laugh
he
is
hers
she
is
to
be
his
wife
his
wife
oh
what
a
singular
dream
shall
she
wake
soon
wake
to
find
that
he
has
gone
and
that
all
that
is
now
happening
is
but
a
phantasy
a
vision
that
will
fade
and
leave
her
desolate
she
starts
presently
and
looks
up
at
him
papa
he
will
miss
me
wonder
where
i
have
gone
she
says
how
long
have
we
been
here
and
she
looks
round
as
if
she
expected
to
see
the
shades
of
night
falling
he
laughs
softly
the
laugh
of
a
man
so
completely
happy
that
time
has
ceased
to
be
of
consequence
i
do
know
what
does
it
matter
your
father
will
know
you
are
all
right
he
will
think
you
have
gone
to
the
beach
that
you
are
playing
with
the
children
how
fond
you
are
of
children
dearest
yes
yes
she
murmurs
i
never
saw
any
one
go
on
with
them
as
you
do
no
wonder
they
love
you
but
i
suppose
everything
and
every
one
does
by
the
way
he
stops
and
a
faint
shadow
falls
on
his
face
i
suppose
there
have
been
ever
so
many
fellows
who
been
in
love
with
you
she
makes
a
little
gesture
of
indifference
as
if
the
thought
was
too
trivial
to
be
entertained
or
spoken
of
what
does
it
matter
who
loved
her
now
that
that
letter
and
the
ring
he
says
inquiringly
she
raises
her
clear
eyes
to
his
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
about
them
she
says
in
a
low
voice
as
if
he
had
the
right
to
search
her
soul
and
she
were
wishing
that
he
should
do
so
no
no
he
rejoins
but
i
will
he
he
who
wrote
the
letter
and
gave
me
the
ring
his
face
grows
cloudier
no
no
tell
me
just
this
he
is
nothing
to
you
you
never
cared
never
she
says
simply
he
has
gone
i
will
tell
you
he
presses
her
face
to
his
to
silence
her
and
a
wave
of
remorse
of
sweeps
over
him
no
no
not
a
word
that
is
enough
for
me
you
are
mine
now
and
always
and
forever
forever
she
breathes
and
and
he
hurries
on
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
about
the
past
the
past
that
did
not
belong
to
me
besides
if
i
did
you
would
have
the
right
to
ask
me
and
he
stops
suddenly
pale
and
trembled
she
looks
up
at
him
i
ask
nothing
she
says
in
a
low
voice
you
shall
tell
me
all
you
want
to
tell
me
just
that
and
no
more
my
darling
my
dearest
he
says
but
the
trouble
still
rings
in
his
voice
shall
he
tell
her
now
is
the
time
she
would
forgive
him
love
him
none
the
less
if
he
told
her
all
now
shall
he
throw
himself
upon
her
great
love
and
mercy
for
a
moment
yorke
guardian
angel
hovers
near
him
and
whispers
tell
her
trust
her
but
he
thrusts
the
angel
aside
and
silences
her
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
dearest
he
says
i
can
tell
you
that
much
no
man
is
worthy
of
you
but
the
best
of
us
could
love
you
better
than
i
do
leslie
leslie
do
you
know
that
when
i
heard
your
name
it
seemed
to
me
the
prettiest
i
had
ever
heard
and
as
if
it
belonged
to
some
one
i
had
loved
for
years
have
you
any
other
name
she
shakes
her
head
is
one
enough
she
says
laughing
softly
i
am
not
big
enough
for
more
than
one
of
two
syllables
why
see
yours
is
only
one
or
have
you
got
more
names
tell
me
them
how
strange
oh
how
strange
i
do
not
know
rightly
what
you
are
called
and
yet
yet
you
love
me
and
promise
to
be
my
wife
why
do
you
say
it
right
out
he
says
she
shakes
her
head
but
your
names
oh
he
says
carelessly
there
a
string
of
yorke
clarence
fitzhardinge
auchester
and
rothbury
she
says
with
sudden
gravity
he
starts
slightly
and
colors
this
foolish
whim
of
the
duke
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
now
duke
of
rothbury
she
goes
on
gravely
and
with
an
almost
troubled
smile
i
i
had
forgotten
go
on
forgetting
he
says
drawing
her
arm
closer
yes
i
you
will
not
be
angry
at
nothing
you
can
say
unless
it
were
do
not
love
you
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
wish
i
could
that
i
wish
you
were
not
a
duke
and
had
no
title
of
any
kind
so
do
i
if
you
wish
it
he
says
what
does
it
matter
but
will
it
not
matter
she
asks
her
brows
coming
together
will
not
the
people
your
people
all
those
great
folks
who
belong
to
you
your
relations
be
angry
with
me
for
for
stooping
to
love
such
a
worthless
useless
creature
as
i
why
should
they
i
i
do
know
yes
i
do
it
is
not
girls
like
me
girls
with
no
title
or
anything
poor
girls
who
know
nothing
of
the
fashionable
world
and
have
no
relations
above
a
plain
who
ought
to
marry
noblemen
i
know
enough
for
that
they
will
be
right
to
be
angry
and
and
disappointed
not
they
he
says
lightly
but
inwardly
chafing
against
the
bonds
which
his
promise
to
the
duke
has
woven
round
him
let
them
mind
their
own
business
but
it
is
their
business
she
says
what
a
duke
a
nobleman
does
must
be
everybody
business
and
everybody
will
be
astonished
and
sorry
wait
until
they
see
you
he
says
confidently
she
looks
up
at
him
with
eyes
dewy
with
gratitude
do
you
think
everybody
will
see
me
with
your
eyes
she
says
in
a
low
voice
i
think
every
man
will
envy
me
and
wish
himself
in
my
place
he
responds
promptly
she
shakes
her
head
no
no
they
will
say
when
they
hear
of
it
that
you
have
done
wrong
and
say
it
still
more
decidedly
when
they
see
me
why
i
shall
not
know
what
to
do
she
laughs
half
i
shall
not
know
how
to
begin
even
to
play
the
great
lady
i
shall
make
all
sorts
of
mistakes
and
call
persons
by
their
wrong
names
and
titles
why
i
did
not
know
how
to
address
you
your
grace
and
she
looks
up
at
him
with
parted
lips
that
smile
but
tremble
a
little
he
kisses
them
tenderly
reassuringly
you
are
only
chaffing
me
he
says
i
can
see
that
you
are
the
last
girl
in
the
world
to
be
frightened
by
anybody
you
just
take
your
place
in
any
set
as
naturally
as
if
you
known
it
and
been
in
it
all
your
life
why
do
you
think
i
do
know
how
proud
you
are
am
i
she
says
yes
i
think
i
was
yesterday
until
until
now
but
now
my
pride
seems
to
have
melted
into
thin
air
and
i
am
only
anxious
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
if
i
were
to
see
that
you
were
even
the
least
bit
ashamed
of
me
what
would
you
do
something
terrible
i
should
die
of
shame
for
your
sake
she
says
slowly
if
you
wait
till
you
die
of
that
complaint
you
live
to
be
as
old
as
what
his
name
methuselah
and
he
laughs
why
i
feel
so
proud
of
winning
you
that
i
trying
all
i
know
not
to
swagger
she
gives
his
arm
just
the
faintest
pressure
oh
how
foolish
how
foolish
she
murmurs
to
be
proud
of
me
i
dare
say
but
i
am
you
see
i
know
i
got
one
of
the
loveliest
women
in
the
world
for
a
wife
and
i
shall
get
beastly
conceited
i
expect
and
perfectly
unendurable
it
is
every
man
who
wins
the
love
of
an
angel
ah
do
she
says
an
angel
they
will
not
think
me
that
but
only
a
commonplace
girl
who
knows
nothing
and
is
not
fit
to
be
a
duchess
she
utters
the
word
as
if
he
did
not
like
it
and
he
colors
again
tell
me
she
says
after
a
moment
tell
me
whom
i
shall
have
to
fear
most
you
see
i
do
know
even
if
you
have
a
mother
a
father
i
do
know
anything
he
is
silent
a
moment
mentally
execrating
the
chain
of
circumstances
which
compel
him
force
him
to
yes
deceive
her
they
are
both
dead
he
says
truthfully
i
have
any
near
relations
no
brother
and
sister
i
mean
i
an
uncle
a
lord
eustace
and
his
two
sons
who
the
next
to
the
dukedom
he
and
they
after
you
she
says
i
do
understand
how
should
i
it
does
not
matter
he
says
hurriedly
tell
me
about
him
then
them
is
he
nice
will
he
be
very
angry
he
laughs
no
he
not
very
nice
he
the
miser
of
the
family
you
see
and
you
have
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
some
of
us
dearest
and
he
care
the
snap
of
his
fingers
whom
i
marry
or
what
becomes
of
me
this
would
sound
singularly
improbable
to
leslie
if
she
were
worldly
wise
but
she
is
not
as
she
says
she
simply
does
not
understand
or
realize
i
am
sorry
she
says
but
i
do
think
it
is
true
you
think
they
are
all
so
proud
and
fond
of
me
he
laughs
with
a
faint
tinge
of
bitterness
well
then
i
other
cousins
mr
temple
she
says
yes
temple
he
mutters
and
what
will
he
say
she
asks
with
a
smile
he
oh
he
stops
yes
what
will
the
duke
say
when
he
hears
that
leslie
has
made
love
as
he
will
put
it
to
the
supposed
duke
look
here
dearest
he
says
after
a
pause
why
should
you
or
i
care
a
brass
farthing
what
any
one
thinks
or
says
the
only
one
i
care
about
is
your
father
ah
papa
she
murmurs
and
she
pictures
to
herself
amazement
and
distress
at
what
he
will
regard
as
a
fuss
and
disturbance
of
his
placid
artistic
life
are
you
afraid
leslie
yorke
asks
i
i
do
know
i
am
all
in
all
to
him
and
i
do
not
know
what
he
will
say
he
will
not
be
pleased
i
mean
he
will
see
more
plainly
than
i
do
that
i
am
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
that
i
am
not
suitable
for
a
duchess
and
he
will
say
it
is
so
sudden
and
it
is
is
it
not
if
he
had
had
a
little
time
to
to
get
used
to
it
let
us
give
him
time
he
says
i
was
going
to
him
now
straight
away
to
ask
him
to
give
you
to
me
but
if
you
think
it
better
if
you
wish
it
it
shall
be
exactly
as
you
think
and
wish
dearest
i
will
wait
for
a
little
while
until
he
knows
me
better
and
has
got
used
to
me
i
suppose
it
would
startle
and
upset
him
if
i
were
to
go
now
oh
yes
yes
she
says
you
do
not
know
how
nervous
he
is
and
how
easily
upset
i
think
i
can
guess
he
responds
thoughtfully
as
he
has
said
it
was
his
intention
to
go
straight
to
lisle
and
tell
him
to
go
to
the
duke
and
announce
the
engagement
but
if
leslie
wishes
the
announcement
delayed
well
it
will
be
as
well
will
it
not
be
better
that
he
should
clear
up
sundry
matters
in
london
before
the
world
hears
of
his
betrothal
besides
how
can
he
go
to
lisle
without
confessing
that
he
has
been
masquerading
as
a
duke
and
explaining
why
before
he
can
do
that
he
must
get
the
duke
to
release
him
from
this
foolish
agreement
which
foolish
as
it
is
still
binds
him
what
shall
we
do
dearest
he
asks
looking
down
at
her
let
us
wait
she
murmurs
let
us
wait
for
a
day
or
two
till
my
father
knows
you
better
and
and
you
have
had
time
to
think
whether
it
is
well
that
you
should
stoop
so
low
her
voice
dies
away
the
mere
thought
of
losing
him
is
an
agony
yes
he
says
almost
solemnly
we
will
wait
but
not
for
that
reason
leslie
i
do
want
to
think
about
anything
of
that
kind
as
to
stooping
well
you
will
learn
some
day
how
i
love
you
and
how
infinitely
above
me
you
are
god
grant
you
will
not
repent
having
stooped
to
me
dearest
yes
we
will
wait
after
all
it
may
seem
sudden
to
them
and
we
will
give
them
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
it
and
meanwhile
she
says
with
a
smile
which
is
half
a
sigh
of
regret
i
will
try
and
realize
that
i
am
to
be
a
great
lady
it
will
seem
rather
hard
at
first
there
ought
to
be
a
school
at
which
one
could
learn
how
to
behave
they
used
to
teach
girls
how
to
enter
a
room
and
bow
and
courtesy
so
that
they
might
not
disgrace
their
belongings
he
holds
her
at
arm
length
and
laughs
at
her
his
eyes
alight
with
admiration
and
love
and
worship
i
seen
you
walk
down
the
street
and
cross
the
beach
leslie
he
says
you
do
want
any
lessons
in
deportment
i
thinking
give
some
of
points
and
beat
them
easily
do
you
ever
look
in
the
glass
do
you
know
that
you
are
the
loveliest
sweetest
woman
man
ever
went
mad
over
oh
hush
hush
she
says
putting
her
finger
lightly
on
his
lips
and
hiding
her
crimson
face
against
his
breast
you
must
be
blind
but
oh
stay
so
dearest
and
never
never
see
me
as
i
really
am
chapter
xii
miss
finetta
two
mornings
later
there
rode
into
the
row
at
hyde
park
a
young
lady
whose
appearance
always
attracted
a
great
deal
of
attention
in
the
first
place
she
was
one
of
the
handsomest
if
not
the
handsomest
woman
there
in
the
next
she
rode
her
horse
as
perfectly
as
it
is
possible
for
a
girl
to
ride
and
lastly
wherever
she
went
on
horseback
or
on
foot
this
lady
was
well
known
in
fact
a
celebrity
for
she
was
miss
finetta
as
she
rode
in
at
a
brisk
canter
in
the
habit
which
seemed
an
outer
skin
of
the
lithe
supple
figure
and
followed
by
her
correctly
clad
groom
mounted
on
a
horse
as
good
as
that
of
his
mistress
the
hats
of
the
men
flew
off
and
the
eyeglasses
of
the
women
went
up
or
their
owners
looked
another
way
but
to
smiles
or
frowns
pleasant
nods
or
icy
stares
finetta
returned
the
same
cool
smile
the
flash
of
her
white
teeth
and
black
eyes
every
now
and
then
london
has
a
fit
sometimes
it
takes
the
shape
of
hero
worship
and
down
the
mob
go
on
their
knees
to
some
celebrity
male
or
female
at
others
it
goes
black
in
the
face
with
hooting
and
at
some
object
which
it
has
suddenly
taken
it
into
its
head
to
hate
at
present
all
london
all
fashionable
male
london
was
in
fits
of
admiration
of
finetta
and
strange
to
say
it
had
rather
more
than
the
usual
excuse
for
its
enthusiasm
for
she
was
a
remarkable
young
woman
not
very
long
ago
she
had
been
playing
in
company
with
other
girls
in
the
alley
in
which
her
father
small
coal
store
was
situated
and
was
perfectly
happy
when
the
organ
man
came
into
the
alley
and
she
and
her
playmates
danced
round
that
popular
instrument
her
mother
wanted
her
to
go
to
school
or
at
any
rate
to
help
her
in
the
green
grocer
shop
which
was
run
in
conjunction
with
the
coal
store
but
finetta
her
name
at
that
time
was
sarah
ann
by
the
way
declined
to
go
to
school
and
confined
her
ministrations
in
the
shop
to
stealing
the
oranges
and
apples
her
mother
alternately
scolded
and
beat
her
her
father
declared
with
emphatic
and
descriptive
language
that
she
would
come
to
no
good
and
sarah
ann
taking
the
scoldings
and
the
beatings
and
the
prophecies
of
a
bad
end
with
infinite
went
on
playing
and
dancing
round
the
organ
quite
happy
in
her
ragged
skirts
and
her
black
tousled
hair
and
almost
as
black
face
and
hands
but
the
gods
they
say
delight
in
surprises
and
one
day
an
individual
happened
to
come
down
that
alley
who
was
fated
to
have
an
immense
influence
on
sarah
ann
career
he
was
a
a
one
and
a
respectable
man
whose
whole
life
had
been
devoted
to
his
art
and
nothing
else
he
saw
the
group
of
girls
dancing
round
the
organ
stood
and
watched
them
with
an
absent
reflective
smile
and
then
suddenly
his
face
lit
up
and
his
eyes
brightened
sarah
ann
had
run
out
from
the
green
grocer
shop
with
an
orange
she
had
stolen
and
as
she
tore
off
the
peel
with
her
white
teeth
set
to
dancing
with
the
rest
the
drew
aside
a
little
and
kept
his
eyes
on
the
lank
angular
girl
whose
dark
orbs
glowed
under
the
excitement
of
the
dance
which
unlike
that
of
her
companions
was
in
perfect
time
with
the
music
and
full
of
a
grace
which
was
as
natural
as
a
young
indian
monsieur
faber
he
was
a
frenchman
went
up
to
her
are
you
fond
of
dancing
he
asked
am
i
ai
i
she
retorted
flashing
her
teeth
upon
him
why
of
course
i
am
who
ai
so
am
i
he
said
would
you
like
to
learn
to
dance
properly
learn
i
can
dance
already
she
retorted
with
a
toss
of
her
head
ah
you
think
so
he
said
smiling
with
a
kind
of
pity
he
looked
round
the
alley
was
empty
excepting
for
the
children
and
he
signed
to
the
organ
man
to
go
on
playing
and
as
he
played
the
thin
dapper
little
frenchman
began
to
dance
we
wo
try
and
describe
it
all
the
world
has
seen
him
and
knows
what
is
meant
when
it
is
said
that
it
was
monsieur
faber
at
his
best
he
seemed
to
be
made
of
springs
india
rubber
springs
to
be
as
light
as
a
thistle
down
to
tread
float
on
air
and
to
possess
the
wind
and
speed
of
a
dervish
the
slip
of
a
girl
watched
him
in
breathless
amazement
and
delight
and
when
he
finished
and
came
on
his
toe
points
as
if
he
had
just
floated
down
from
the
grimy
she
uttered
a
sigh
of
envy
and
admiration
i
could
do
that
she
said
looking
at
him
sullenly
but
wistfully
no
not
yet
he
said
and
why
my
child
because
you
have
not
been
taught
one
does
not
know
how
to
dance
till
one
learns
would
you
like
to
learn
should
i
just
she
responded
take
me
to
your
mother
and
we
will
see
he
said
she
ran
sprang
into
the
shop
mother
here
a
man
as
dances
like
like
an
angel
she
said
a
hangel
and
he
going
to
teach
me
the
poor
woman
went
for
her
with
a
stick
that
lay
handy
but
faber
interposed
and
entered
on
an
explanation
and
a
proposal
he
would
take
sarah
ann
as
a
pupil
teach
her
to
dance
get
her
an
engagement
at
one
of
the
theaters
and
in
return
she
was
to
be
bound
to
him
as
a
kind
of
apprentice
and
give
him
a
certain
percentage
it
was
a
fair
one
of
all
she
might
earn
for
the
next
five
years
sarah
ann
parents
hesitated
but
sarah
ann
cut
the
negotiation
short
by
coolly
announcing
her
determination
in
the
event
of
their
refusing
to
accept
the
offer
to
cut
and
run
and
knowing
that
she
was
quite
capable
of
carrying
out
her
threat
the
couple
consented
faber
christened
her
finetta
and
commenced
the
lessons
at
once
he
had
two
daughters
of
his
own
but
though
they
worked
hard
neither
they
nor
any
of
the
other
pupils
were
half
so
quick
at
the
enchanting
science
as
sarah
ann
pardon
finetta
the
daughter
of
the
small
coal
man
she
worked
hard
almost
day
and
night
it
might
be
said
that
she
danced
in
her
dreams
she
had
a
good
ear
for
music
if
you
only
had
a
voice
my
dear
child
faber
would
murmur
throwing
up
his
hands
and
when
she
danced
it
was
like
a
human
instrument
playing
moving
in
accord
and
harmony
with
the
mechanical
one
the
violin
or
the
piano
she
would
do
nothing
at
home
in
the
alley
would
not
serve
in
the
shop
or
keep
the
small
coal
accounts
or
wash
her
face
or
brush
her
hair
but
she
obeyed
faber
with
an
eager
alacrity
which
was
almost
pathetic
i
want
to
dance
better
than
any
one
in
the
world
she
would
say
and
her
master
encouraged
her
by
remarking
that
it
was
not
unlikely
she
would
attain
her
wish
the
months
passed
on
the
angular
girl
all
legs
and
wings
like
a
pullet
grew
into
a
graceful
young
woman
with
a
face
which
if
not
beautiful
in
the
regulation
way
was
singularly
striking
with
flashing
eyes
and
rather
large
but
mobile
lips
there
is
a
great
future
before
that
girl
faber
would
remark
to
his
wife
a
woman
who
treated
all
the
pupils
as
if
they
were
her
own
children
but
he
did
not
hurry
one
does
not
learn
to
dance
in
a
day
he
would
say
when
finetta
begged
him
to
get
her
an
engagement
even
if
it
were
ever
so
small
a
one
patience
my
good
child
and
when
the
time
comes
you
shall
see
the
time
came
and
finetta
appeared
among
the
ladies
of
the
ballet
at
a
small
provincial
theater
he
kept
her
in
the
ranks
for
two
years
then
gave
her
a
solo
part
and
lastly
obtained
an
engagement
for
her
at
the
diadem
to
dance
at
the
diadem
was
the
height
of
finetta
ambition
her
heart
beat
that
night
as
it
had
never
beat
before
not
even
on
her
first
appearance
at
the
provincial
theater
but
it
did
not
deafen
the
music
or
drive
her
steps
out
of
her
mind
and
when
she
had
finished
the
roar
of
delight
that
rose
in
the
theater
proclaimed
the
fact
that
finetta
had
scored
a
triumph
and
that
faber
had
not
labored
in
vain
this
was
three
years
ago
her
popularity
had
steadily
increased
she
was
now
the
rage
her
salary
exceeded
that
of
a
cabinet
minister
the
percentage
alone
was
a
good
income
for
the
patient
persevering
faber
when
she
appeared
at
night
the
house
roared
a
welcome
and
rewarded
her
efforts
with
thunders
of
applause
her
photographs
were
placed
among
the
other
celebrities
in
the
shop
windows
next
those
of
the
royal
family
the
great
poets
the
eminent
statesmen
and
sold
as
well
as
if
not
better
than
the
rest
outside
the
theater
hung
a
huge
transparency
showing
finetta
in
her
spanish
the
tobacconists
sold
a
cigarette
bearing
her
name
all
this
ought
to
have
turned
her
head
it
did
a
little
but
only
a
little
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
a
girl
and
in
her
prosperity
did
not
forget
those
near
to
her
she
set
her
father
up
in
the
wholesale
coal
trade
and
put
her
mother
into
a
nice
house
in
islington
sent
her
brother
to
school
and
had
her
sister
to
live
with
her
in
the
pretty
house
in
john
wood
and
though
the
world
said
hard
things
of
her
she
was
unjustly
accused
and
calumniated
her
manners
were
not
those
of
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
she
gave
supper
parties
at
which
only
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
the
ballet
were
present
she
talked
and
laughed
loudly
she
knew
nothing
and
cared
less
for
the
proprieties
was
fond
of
champagne
and
enjoyed
a
cigarette
delighted
in
riding
and
driving
tandem
and
did
both
surpassingly
well
but
scandal
could
find
no
chink
in
her
armor
through
which
to
shoot
its
poisoned
darts
and
the
worst
the
world
could
with
truth
call
her
was
finetta
the
dancer
the
men
who
thronged
round
her
called
her
a
good
fellow
and
when
a
woman
of
her
class
has
earned
that
title
depend
upon
it
she
is
not
so
black
as
the
virtuous
paint
her
she
knew
half
the
peerage
the
male
side
but
she
was
as
friendly
and
pleasant
to
a
struggling
young
journalist
as
to
my
lord
vinson
men
sent
her
letters
telling
her
they
adored
her
she
lit
her
cigarettes
with
them
and
told
the
writers
when
next
she
saw
them
not
to
waste
ink
and
paper
upon
her
but
to
make
up
a
party
to
take
her
for
a
drive
and
a
dinner
at
richmond
sometimes
very
often
they
sent
her
presents
diamond
rings
bracelets
pendants
lockets
with
their
portraits
which
she
always
took
out
and
she
accepted
them
with
a
careless
which
was
amusing
to
all
but
the
donors
the
horses
she
and
her
groom
rode
were
a
gift
from
a
turf
lord
it
was
said
that
the
lease
of
the
house
at
john
wood
had
been
given
to
her
but
that
was
not
true
why
should
i
take
she
said
to
her
sister
they
only
give
to
some
one
else
who
would
look
half
so
well
on
them
and
would
know
how
to
ride
so
that
she
often
danced
at
the
diadem
wearing
gems
which
made
the
ladies
in
the
stalls
envious
and
appeared
in
the
row
riding
a
horse
which
was
a
and
going
one
than
even
lady
harkaway
the
famous
sportswoman
sometimes
one
of
the
young
men
who
paid
her
court
fell
in
love
with
her
genuine
honest
love
and
offered
to
make
her
his
wife
she
might
have
been
a
countess
had
she
chosen
but
she
did
not
choose
no
thank
you
she
said
to
one
young
peer
who
implored
her
with
something
like
tears
in
his
eyes
to
marry
him
what
would
be
the
use
you
find
out
that
you
made
a
mistake
before
a
month
was
out
and
so
should
i
then
people
would
cut
me
and
i
should
like
that
besides
you
want
me
to
give
up
dancing
and
live
what
you
call
respectable
and
i
certain
i
should
like
that
no
you
go
and
marry
one
of
your
own
set
and
take
a
box
for
my
next
benefit
and
bring
her
and
you
be
able
to
say
what
you
saved
me
from
you
would
oh
yes
you
would
i
know
your
sort
of
people
too
well
you
wo
take
an
answer
well
then
the
truth
is
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
marry
till
i
come
across
a
man
i
can
really
care
for
and
i
not
tumbled
on
any
one
yet
thank
you
she
knew
the
world
very
well
did
finetta
she
sent
them
away
when
they
got
too
foolish
as
she
said
and
wanted
to
marry
her
dismissing
them
enough
in
fact
she
was
not
a
woman
and
it
was
only
at
times
that
her
passionate
nature
revealed
itself
at
such
times
when
she
let
out
it
was
a
revelation
indeed
it
was
almost
as
safe
to
brave
the
tigress
in
her
den
at
the
zoological
gardens
as
to
affront
finetta
and
they
who
had
done
it
once
were
satisfied
with
the
attempt
and
did
not
repeat
it
now
one
day
or
rather
one
night
there
came
yorke
auchester
and
with
him
a
change
in
the
life
of
finetta
they
were
friends
at
once
she
amused
and
interested
him
he
liked
to
see
her
dance
liked
to
hear
her
talk
in
her
cynical
way
liked
to
drop
in
at
the
little
house
in
john
wood
after
the
theater
at
the
little
suppers
over
which
she
presided
with
a
gayety
which
made
them
extremely
pleasant
he
admired
her
on
horseback
admired
her
pluck
her
coolness
her
readiness
to
give
and
take
in
the
game
of
repartee
and
so
it
came
about
that
of
all
the
men
none
were
so
often
in
her
company
as
yorke
we
are
the
slaves
of
habit
this
is
by
no
means
a
new
saying
but
it
is
a
painfully
true
one
yorke
got
into
the
habit
of
dropping
in
at
the
diadem
for
great
dance
got
into
the
habit
of
dropping
in
at
john
wood
of
driving
her
down
to
richmond
of
riding
with
her
in
the
park
or
into
the
country
and
although
he
seldom
gave
her
presents
never
told
her
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
the
cleverest
the
best
of
her
sex
as
most
of
the
other
men
did
finetta
liked
him
better
than
all
the
rest
put
together
and
so
the
chain
began
to
be
forged
when
she
went
on
the
stage
her
dark
eyes
would
scan
the
stalls
and
if
she
saw
his
handsome
careless
face
and
long
figure
there
a
little
smile
would
curve
her
lips
and
she
would
dance
her
best
at
the
little
supper
parties
she
managed
somehow
or
other
that
he
would
sit
beside
her
if
she
were
dull
before
he
came
she
brightened
up
when
he
made
his
appearance
if
she
had
made
an
engagement
she
would
break
it
if
yorke
asked
her
to
ride
and
drive
with
him
he
did
see
this
marked
preference
for
some
time
but
the
others
did
her
quiet
little
sister
who
ran
the
house
once
said
fin
you
going
soft
on
that
big
lord
yorke
and
the
next
moment
had
sufficient
cause
for
being
sorry
that
she
had
spoken
but
it
was
the
truth
finetta
who
had
laughed
love
to
scorn
and
broken
or
cracked
so
many
hearts
was
in
a
fair
way
to
discover
that
she
had
a
heart
of
her
own
often
when
he
had
left
her
she
would
sit
perfectly
motionless
and
silent
thinking
hard
then
she
would
start
up
with
a
laugh
and
burst
into
a
song
but
it
often
ended
with
a
sigh
she
was
angry
with
herself
and
she
fought
hard
against
the
thralldom
that
was
creeping
over
her
but
she
could
no
more
help
feeling
happy
when
he
was
present
and
miserable
when
he
was
absent
than
she
could
help
dancing
in
time
or
dropping
her
when
she
was
excited
nothing
stands
still
in
this
world
love
grows
or
decreases
love
for
lord
yorke
grew
day
by
day
until
it
had
reached
such
a
pass
that
when
he
went
off
she
needs
must
throw
up
her
part
for
the
night
and
follow
him
and
failing
to
find
him
come
back
wretched
at
heart
though
outwardly
as
cool
and
debonair
as
usual
that
morning
as
she
was
putting
on
her
habit
her
sister
polly
had
ventured
to
say
a
few
more
words
of
warning
that
lord
yorke
will
make
your
heart
ache
fin
she
said
as
she
buttoned
her
sister
boots
oh
will
he
she
retorted
with
a
dash
of
color
coming
into
her
cheeks
yes
he
will
and
what
the
good
he
wo
ask
you
to
marry
him
oh
wo
he
how
do
you
know
i
heard
them
talk
about
him
he
as
poor
as
a
rat
but
i
not
no
i
dare
say
but
that
wo
help
you
besides
he
a
good
as
engaged
to
that
lady
eleanor
dallas
finetta
jerked
her
foot
away
and
her
eyes
began
to
glow
dangerously
her
why
she
like
a
wax
doll
oh
no
she
is
said
polly
she
as
as
most
of
the
swells
and
more
so
besides
she
rolling
in
money
and
it
money
he
wants
take
my
advice
fin
and
do
let
him
hang
about
you
any
longer
and
you
take
my
advice
and
hold
your
tongue
retorted
finetta
he
shall
hang
about
me
as
much
as
he
likes
who
said
i
wanted
to
marry
him
or
or
that
i
would
if
he
asked
me
i
do
if
he
give
you
the
chance
said
polly
finetta
drew
her
foot
away
i
button
the
other
myself
she
said
passionately
but
when
her
sister
had
gone
she
sat
with
the
other
boot
unbuttoned
and
kept
the
groom
and
the
horses
waiting
for
a
good
and
when
she
did
go
down
and
mount
and
ride
off
her
handsome
face
was
clouded
and
thoughtful
but
at
the
sight
of
the
green
park
and
the
people
she
chased
the
melancholy
brooding
out
of
her
dark
eyes
and
touching
the
magnificent
horse
with
her
golden
spur
sent
him
into
the
row
in
her
style
if
he
were
only
here
she
thought
and
a
sigh
came
to
her
lips
somehow
i
feel
tired
and
bored
without
him
and
lost
if
he
away
for
a
day
or
two
going
to
marry
lady
eleanor
is
he
almost
before
the
muttered
words
had
left
her
lips
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
stalwart
figure
standing
against
the
rails
and
the
color
flew
to
her
face
as
she
brought
the
horse
up
beside
him
it
was
yorke
yorke
leaning
against
the
rail
with
his
usually
careless
face
grave
and
thoughtful
his
eyes
absent
and
staring
vacantly
at
the
ground
and
yet
with
a
strange
look
in
them
which
she
with
a
quickness
noticed
in
an
instant
yorke
she
said
bending
down
he
started
and
looked
up
and
her
name
came
to
his
lips
but
without
the
friendly
smile
which
usually
accompanied
it
why
when
did
you
come
back
she
asked
her
face
her
eyes
all
alight
with
life
and
happiness
he
said
sultan
looking
well
where
have
you
been
she
demanded
noticing
a
change
in
his
voice
did
you
get
any
fishing
not
much
he
said
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
horse
no
then
why
did
you
come
back
it
been
awfully
slow
without
you
did
you
know
that
i
had
a
day
off
and
run
down
to
the
country
i
was
near
you
i
believe
why
did
you
leave
word
where
you
were
going
what
the
matter
with
you
she
broke
off
sharply
her
color
coming
and
going
for
there
had
come
into
his
face
into
his
eyes
a
look
almost
of
pity
newly
born
pity
he
knew
now
that
he
himself
loved
that
this
woman
loved
him
and
how
she
would
suffer
presently
i
come
in
after
the
theater
he
said
ride
on
now
or
we
shall
have
a
crowd
several
men
had
stopped
but
waited
as
if
recognizing
yorke
right
to
monopolize
her
very
well
she
said
and
she
turned
the
horse
it
has
come
at
last
she
murmured
at
last
he
is
going
to
be
married
i
know
it
i
know
her
breath
came
painfully
and
her
hand
stole
up
to
her
heart
at
that
moment
a
lady
came
riding
in
the
opposite
direction
she
was
fair
as
a
lily
and
as
beautiful
with
soft
brown
eyes
that
looked
dreamily
about
her
but
as
they
met
the
dark
ones
of
finetta
they
seemed
to
awake
and
the
softness
instantly
vanished
and
gave
place
to
an
expression
that
in
a
man
would
be
called
hard
and
calculating
finetta
face
pale
a
moment
before
grew
white
that
her
she
muttered
and
he
is
going
to
marry
her
right
she
beautiful
beautiful
and
different
to
me
he
marry
and
love
her
her
head
drooped
and
her
lips
set
tightly
and
then
she
rode
on
but
suddenly
she
stopped
the
horse
under
some
trees
and
looked
back
the
beautiful
girl
with
the
soft
brown
eyes
had
stopped
beside
the
rail
and
yorke
and
she
were
shaking
hands
finetta
could
see
their
faces
distinctly
and
she
watched
scanned
his
eagerly
a
singular
expression
came
into
her
bold
handsome
face
it
not
her
he
thinking
of
she
said
not
her
there
the
same
look
in
his
eyes
as
when
he
looked
up
at
me
what
is
it
i
find
out
her
white
teeth
came
together
with
a
click
i
feel
like
fighting
going
to
marry
lady
eleanor
is
he
we
see
oh
yorke
if
if
she
looked
round
at
the
aristocrats
riding
past
there
is
one
that
could
love
you
as
i
do
chapter
xiii
what
a
mess
i
in
lady
eleanor
pulled
her
horse
up
beside
the
railing
as
finetta
had
done
and
smiled
down
upon
yorke
she
had
a
beautiful
smile
which
beginning
in
her
brown
eyes
spread
over
her
face
to
her
lips
the
cleanly
cut
lips
which
more
than
anything
else
gave
her
countenance
the
patrician
look
for
which
finetta
and
others
hated
her
and
she
did
not
smile
too
often
well
yorke
she
said
and
her
voice
was
low
and
clear
and
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
languid
hauteur
in
it
that
was
also
aristocratic
what
a
lovely
day
why
are
you
riding
she
did
ask
him
as
finetta
had
done
where
he
had
been
that
would
have
been
a
mistake
which
lady
eleanor
was
far
too
wise
to
make
horse
is
lame
he
said
oh
what
a
pity
she
exclaimed
nodding
to
some
friends
who
were
passing
just
when
you
want
him
too
yes
he
said
though
i
am
going
to
sell
him
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
and
raised
her
brown
eyes
with
a
faint
surprise
going
to
sell
peter
i
thought
he
suited
you
so
well
he
nodded
and
laughed
rather
uneasily
the
announcement
that
he
intended
to
sell
his
horse
had
been
a
slip
of
the
tongue
oh
he
suits
me
well
enough
but
i
shall
sell
him
all
the
same
what
a
lot
of
people
there
are
here
are
there
she
said
bowing
and
smiling
to
one
and
another
of
the
men
who
saluted
her
nearly
everybody
one
knows
by
the
way
i
seen
the
duke
this
morning
dolph
down
in
the
country
he
said
oh
she
would
not
have
asked
where
even
had
she
not
known
that
would
have
been
another
mistake
of
which
she
would
not
have
been
guilty
for
worlds
but
her
oh
gave
him
a
chance
to
tell
her
if
he
chose
apparently
he
did
not
choose
for
he
changed
the
subject
how
did
the
spelham
dance
go
off
last
night
very
well
she
replied
but
it
was
terribly
crowded
the
princess
was
there
i
saved
a
couple
of
dances
for
you
as
long
as
i
could
i
sorry
he
said
i
could
get
back
she
looked
quite
satisfied
with
the
explanation
or
rather
want
of
one
quite
satisfied
and
serenely
placid
you
missed
a
very
pleasant
ball
was
all
she
said
i
must
go
on
now
will
you
come
in
to
luncheon
aunt
will
be
very
pleased
to
see
you
and
you
too
he
said
as
a
matter
of
course
he
always
had
a
good
supply
of
such
small
change
about
him
she
smiled
and
i
too
certainly
she
said
and
with
a
nod
rode
on
yorke
looked
after
her
thoughtfully
and
gnawed
his
mustache
the
last
two
days
had
been
the
happiest
in
his
life
he
had
spent
them
with
leslie
had
walked
with
her
through
the
lanes
and
on
the
beach
and
had
driven
her
to
northcliffe
and
every
moment
of
the
delicious
time
his
love
had
increased
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
not
really
loved
till
now
and
that
his
past
existence
had
been
a
sheer
waste
and
he
had
been
happy
notwithstanding
that
he
was
still
deceiving
her
that
she
still
thought
him
the
duke
of
rothbury
and
that
he
had
come
to
town
to
break
off
with
two
women
who
loved
him
it
is
well
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
before
you
are
on
with
the
new
even
when
there
is
only
one
old
love
but
when
there
are
two
it
had
cost
him
a
great
deal
to
tear
himself
away
from
leslie
even
for
a
few
days
but
he
had
done
so
and
all
the
way
up
to
town
he
had
been
hard
at
work
forming
most
excellent
resolutions
he
would
reform
and
reform
altogether
he
would
sell
his
horse
send
in
his
resignation
to
two
or
three
of
his
most
expensive
clubs
would
give
up
cards
and
betting
especially
betting
he
did
see
why
he
should
do
without
a
fleming
his
valet
had
been
a
faithful
fellow
and
suited
him
down
to
the
ground
but
yes
fleming
must
go
and
then
well
then
he
would
go
to
lisle
and
ask
for
that
pearl
of
great
price
his
daughter
and
marry
his
heart
leaps
at
the
thought
marry
leslie
he
pictured
her
as
a
bride
drew
delightful
mental
sketches
of
the
time
they
would
have
he
would
take
her
to
the
continent
for
their
and
then
settle
down
in
a
cottage
it
would
have
to
be
a
cottage
love
in
a
cottage
great
goodness
how
often
he
had
laughed
at
the
idea
how
he
had
pitied
the
poor
devils
who
had
committed
matrimony
and
gone
out
of
the
world
to
live
in
respectable
poverty
with
cold
mutton
and
cheap
sherry
for
luncheon
but
cold
mutton
and
cheap
sherry
did
seem
so
bad
with
leslie
to
share
them
he
would
have
to
give
up
a
great
deal
of
course
and
live
within
the
small
income
left
of
his
mother
dower
what
a
fearful
lot
of
money
he
had
spent
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
but
now
he
went
through
a
little
mental
arithmetic
and
was
quite
startled
would
anybody
believe
that
gloves
stalls
at
the
diadem
cigars
dinners
at
richmond
could
run
up
to
such
a
sum
what
would
he
give
for
some
of
the
money
now
he
took
out
the
check
and
looked
at
it
it
was
a
large
sum
but
he
owed
all
that
and
a
great
deal
more
then
he
put
dull
care
behind
him
and
gave
himself
up
to
thinking
of
leslie
her
beautiful
face
ten
times
more
lovely
than
when
he
had
first
seen
it
how
that
her
love
for
him
was
shining
in
her
eyes
what
eyes
they
were
eleanor
were
nice
ones
finetta
were
handsome
ones
but
leslie
and
her
voice
too
he
could
hear
it
now
calling
him
yorke
he
reached
town
and
went
to
his
rooms
in
bury
street
and
fleming
had
got
his
london
clothes
the
frock
coat
and
flawless
hat
all
ready
as
if
he
had
expected
him
and
yorke
heart
smote
him
as
he
thought
that
he
would
have
to
give
that
faithful
servant
notice
then
he
went
out
still
thinking
of
leslie
and
the
dark
gray
eyes
which
had
grown
moist
and
tender
as
she
said
and
then
had
come
finetta
and
lady
eleanor
yes
he
had
got
his
work
cut
out
for
him
but
he
would
do
it
he
would
devote
his
life
to
the
dear
sweet
girl
down
at
portmaris
whose
pure
unstained
heart
he
had
won
he
would
reform
cut
london
and
go
and
be
happy
in
a
cottage
for
the
rest
of
his
life
meanwhile
he
had
promised
to
lunch
with
lady
eleanor
the
woman
whom
the
duke
and
the
world
at
large
had
decided
that
he
was
going
to
marry
and
he
had
promised
to
sup
with
finetta
who
doubtless
thought
that
he
should
marry
her
he
had
made
love
to
both
these
women
it
was
so
easy
for
him
with
his
handsome
face
and
smile
he
had
only
been
half
in
earnest
if
so
much
had
meant
well
what
had
he
meant
by
soft
speeches
just
murmured
by
tender
glances
by
eloquent
pressures
of
the
hand
but
they
how
had
they
taken
this
easy
of
his
he
knew
too
well
oh
lord
what
a
mess
i
in
he
muttered
as
he
made
his
way
slowly
toward
lady
eleanor
house
in
palace
gardens
lady
eleanor
rode
home
rather
quickly
and
as
she
entered
the
in
which
her
aunt
lady
denby
was
sitting
there
was
a
brightness
in
her
soft
eyes
and
a
color
in
her
cheeks
which
caused
the
elder
lady
to
regard
her
curiously
yorke
is
coming
to
luncheon
she
said
and
lady
denby
at
once
knew
the
cause
of
her
niece
vivacity
i
wonder
whether
they
can
send
up
some
lobster
cutlets
he
is
so
fond
of
them
you
know
at
any
rate
will
you
see
that
they
put
on
the
claret
he
likes
the
it
is
it
oh
yes
we
will
serve
up
the
fatted
calf
said
lady
denby
with
a
smile
so
his
gracious
majesty
has
come
back
yes
said
lady
eleanor
moving
about
the
room
restlessly
and
flicking
her
with
her
whip
yes
and
he
looks
very
well
but
but
what
well
i
scarcely
know
how
to
put
it
he
seemed
grave
and
more
serious
than
usual
this
morning
it
is
often
yorke
is
serious
you
know
he
has
been
up
to
something
more
reckless
and
desperate
than
usual
perhaps
suggested
lady
denby
perhaps
assented
lady
eleanor
coolly
you
say
that
with
delicious
remarked
lady
denby
i
suppose
if
he
had
been
committing
murder
or
treason
it
would
make
no
difference
to
you
not
one
atom
said
the
girl
her
color
deepening
the
only
crime
that
would
ruin
him
in
your
eyes
would
be
matrimony
with
some
one
other
than
yourself
lady
eleanor
started
and
bit
her
lip
then
she
forced
a
laugh
i
do
know
whether
even
that
would
cure
me
she
said
i
should
hate
his
wife
hate
her
with
an
active
hatred
which
would
embitter
all
my
days
but
i
would
go
on
caring
for
him
and
hoping
that
his
wife
might
die
and
that
i
might
marry
him
after
all
lady
denby
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
looked
at
the
proud
face
with
its
tightly
drawn
lips
and
now
brooding
eyes
yours
is
about
the
worst
case
i
think
i
have
ever
met
with
eleanor
she
said
oh
no
it
is
responded
lady
eleanor
only
i
not
ashamed
to
admit
how
it
is
with
me
and
other
women
are
but
you
need
be
afraid
on
my
account
i
only
wear
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
for
you
to
peck
at
i
keep
my
secret
from
the
rest
of
the
world
or
think
you
do
said
lady
denby
and
how
is
it
going
to
end
god
knows
exclaimed
lady
eleanor
with
an
infinite
and
pathetic
wistfulness
sometimes
i
wish
i
were
dead
or
he
were
what
yes
i
rather
see
him
dead
than
the
husband
of
another
woman
my
dear
nell
you
are
shocked
well
you
must
be
so
it
the
truth
sometimes
i
wake
in
the
night
from
a
dream
that
he
has
married
and
that
i
am
standing
by
and
see
him
put
the
ring
on
and
i
feel
she
stopped
and
laughed
with
a
mixture
of
bitterness
and
what
weak
miserable
fools
we
women
are
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
whole
world
worth
one
hundredth
part
of
the
suffering
we
undergo
certainly
yorke
auchester
does
not
lady
eleanor
swung
round
on
her
with
a
kind
of
subdued
fierceness
what
have
you
to
say
against
him
i
thought
he
was
a
favorite
of
yours
so
he
is
but
i
not
blind
to
his
faults
his
faults
what
are
they
he
is
selfish
for
one
thing
selfish
he
would
give
away
his
last
penny
i
dare
say
he
hates
coppers
would
go
to
the
end
of
the
earth
to
save
a
friend
is
truth
itself
and
where
is
there
a
braver
man
than
yorke
auchester
her
voice
softened
and
faltered
as
she
spoke
his
name
or
a
more
foolish
and
infatuated
girl
than
eleanor
dallas
said
her
aunt
there
and
she
stroked
the
golden
head
which
eleanor
had
let
fall
on
her
hands
you
ca
help
it
i
suppose
and
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
see
that
he
has
what
he
likes
for
luncheon
thank
heaven
if
we
know
nothing
more
about
men
we
know
the
nearest
way
to
their
hearts
lady
eleanor
put
out
her
hand
to
stop
her
aunt
for
a
moment
i
i
saw
that
woman
this
morning
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
mean
finetta
yes
she
had
come
into
the
park
to
meet
him
i
believe
i
saw
them
talking
together
she
is
a
beautiful
woman
very
she
is
that
i
do
wonder
at
his
being
fond
of
her
and
liking
to
be
with
her
i
hear
they
are
seldom
apart
said
lady
denby
gravely
that
ought
to
cure
you
if
anything
would
eleanor
lady
eleanor
shook
her
head
it
only
makes
it
worse
she
said
with
her
face
hidden
jealousy
does
kill
love
but
wounded
pride
should
do
so
no
no
it
true
i
proud
enough
to
the
rest
of
the
world
but
it
all
goes
slips
away
from
me
when
when
i
am
near
him
oh
dear
why
this
morning
when
i
saw
him
my
heart
and
he
looked
up
at
me
as
if
he
had
seen
me
only
an
hour
or
two
ago
but
there
what
is
the
use
of
talking
i
hope
they
will
have
some
of
these
cutlets
lady
denby
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
head
it
a
pity
that
yorke
does
not
know
what
is
good
for
him
he
could
have
lobster
cutlets
and
claret
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
all
manner
of
good
things
if
he
would
only
throw
his
handkerchief
in
the
right
direction
lady
eleanor
smiled
up
at
her
almost
defiantly
it
is
of
no
use
your
taunting
me
she
said
you
are
right
if
he
threw
his
handkerchief
as
you
put
it
i
should
be
only
too
glad
to
go
on
my
knees
to
pick
it
up
a
servant
came
to
the
door
with
a
card
on
a
salver
lady
denby
took
it
and
glanced
at
it
it
is
ralph
duncombe
she
said
i
can
not
see
him
this
morning
say
that
i
am
not
at
home
lady
denby
signed
to
the
footman
to
wait
ought
you
not
to
see
him
she
said
in
a
low
voice
it
may
be
important
business
oh
very
well
show
duncombe
into
the
library
that
right
said
lady
denby
approvingly
you
ca
afford
to
offend
such
a
man
as
this
duncombe
there
are
not
too
many
men
who
are
willing
to
work
for
you
for
nothing
i
suppose
he
has
come
about
those
mines
i
suppose
so
assented
lady
eleanor
bitterly
i
will
go
and
see
ralph
duncombe
had
been
a
friend
of
lady
eleanor
father
the
late
earl
had
been
fond
of
dabbling
in
the
city
and
had
met
the
successful
young
merchant
there
and
found
him
extremely
useful
it
had
been
chiefly
owing
to
ralph
duncombe
advice
and
counsel
that
the
late
earl
had
made
the
fifty
thousand
pounds
which
he
had
left
to
lady
eleanor
he
had
done
nothing
for
some
years
before
his
death
without
consulting
the
keen
man
of
business
and
lady
eleanor
had
followed
her
example
she
would
not
have
been
a
particularly
rich
woman
with
fifty
thousand
at
three
per
but
ralph
duncombe
had
invested
it
for
her
in
such
a
way
that
it
had
brought
in
sometimes
ten
and
fifteen
he
had
bought
shares
and
sold
them
again
at
a
big
profit
had
dealt
with
her
money
as
if
it
had
been
his
own
and
had
been
as
lucky
with
it
the
greatest
and
latest
piece
of
good
fortune
had
only
just
turned
up
he
had
purchased
some
land
on
the
coast
calculating
to
dispose
of
it
to
a
building
company
but
while
negotiating
with
them
discovered
traces
of
copper
and
it
was
on
the
cards
that
he
had
by
one
of
those
flukes
which
seemed
to
come
so
often
to
ralph
duncombe
found
a
large
fortune
for
her
how
do
you
do
mr
duncombe
she
said
what
a
shame
that
you
should
have
to
come
all
this
way
from
the
city
it
does
not
take
long
by
the
underground
he
said
in
his
grave
voice
as
he
shook
hands
and
i
have
some
important
news
for
you
yes
she
said
and
she
motioned
him
to
a
chair
as
he
sat
down
she
noticed
that
he
looked
graver
than
usual
and
that
there
was
a
tired
and
rather
sad
expression
in
his
eyes
is
it
bad
news
she
said
bad
he
looked
at
her
with
faint
surprise
i
thought
you
looked
graver
than
usual
and
rather
disappointed
she
explained
he
flushed
slightly
and
forced
a
smile
we
business
men
seldom
look
elated
he
said
with
something
like
a
sigh
money
making
is
not
an
exhilarating
pursuit
lady
eleanor
i
should
have
thought
otherwise
she
said
but
i
do
know
much
about
it
i
only
know
that
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
over
my
affairs
not
at
all
it
comes
natural
to
me
he
said
with
a
slight
smile
i
was
your
father
adviser
if
i
may
put
it
so
for
so
long
and
so
intimately
that
it
seems
a
matter
of
course
that
i
should
continue
to
be
his
daughter
but
about
this
copper
lady
eleanor
we
were
not
mistaken
the
indications
are
particularly
distinct
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
land
contains
a
vast
quantity
yes
she
said
that
is
good
news
i
suppose
it
will
make
me
very
rich
he
nodded
yes
immensely
so
the
thing
to
decide
now
is
how
to
work
it
i
have
a
plan
which
i
should
like
you
to
consider
and
he
went
on
to
explain
it
to
her
she
listened
not
very
attentively
i
leave
it
all
to
you
she
said
when
he
had
finished
i
suppose
you
will
think
that
is
very
cool
of
me
but
i
do
know
what
else
i
could
do
that
is
if
you
will
undertake
the
business
for
me
he
nodded
i
will
do
so
and
not
altogether
disinterestedly
for
i
shall
ask
your
permission
to
take
some
shares
in
the
company
why
yes
of
course
she
said
at
once
i
consider
that
it
belongs
as
much
to
you
as
to
me
you
found
it
he
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
scarcely
that
he
said
but
i
shall
have
an
interest
in
it
we
shall
get
to
work
at
once
and
i
think
i
may
say
positively
that
you
will
be
as
you
put
it
very
rich
before
many
months
are
out
very
rich
she
murmured
thank
you
it
was
rather
a
strange
way
of
accepting
the
information
but
she
was
thinking
of
how
little
use
the
money
would
be
if
a
certain
person
refused
to
share
it
with
her
ralph
duncombe
glanced
at
his
watch
and
got
up
you
will
stay
to
lunch
she
said
thank
you
lady
eleanor
not
this
morning
i
have
to
attend
a
board
meeting
and
shall
be
late
as
it
is
i
am
sorry
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
as
he
held
it
she
said
as
if
at
a
sudden
thought
did
you
did
you
get
those
bills
i
asked
you
about
lord
auchester
he
said
and
he
noticed
that
her
hand
quivered
yes
i
bought
them
up
he
looked
at
her
gravely
it
cost
rather
a
larger
sum
than
i
expected
you
mean
that
he
was
very
much
in
debt
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
downcast
eyes
yes
very
much
he
replied
laconically
she
bit
her
lip
softly
and
still
evaded
his
keen
gaze
tell
me
she
said
you
know
i
do
not
understand
such
matters
but
but
supposing
that
you
were
to
compel
him
to
pay
these
bills
what
would
be
the
result
you
mean
try
to
compel
him
he
said
with
a
smile
you
can
not
get
water
from
a
dry
well
lady
eleanor
and
from
what
i
hear
lord
auchester
is
a
very
dry
well
if
you
forced
him
to
take
up
those
bills
you
would
ruin
him
ruin
him
yes
that
means
that
you
would
make
a
kind
of
outcast
of
him
a
man
who
can
not
meet
his
engagements
is
dishonored
he
would
have
to
give
up
his
clubs
and
leave
london
i
do
know
where
such
men
go
now
to
some
corner
of
spain
i
believe
any
way
he
would
be
ruined
and
thoroughly
finished
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
i
and
i
could
do
that
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
you
could
do
that
as
i
hold
the
bills
for
you
certainly
he
replied
thank
you
she
said
with
a
laugh
that
sounded
forced
and
unnatural
i
only
wanted
to
know
i
afraid
you
must
think
me
sublimely
ignorant
not
more
so
than
a
lady
should
be
of
business
matters
he
replied
politely
there
was
a
moment
pause
he
took
up
his
hat
and
gloves
then
suddenly
lady
eleanor
said
do
you
know
a
place
called
portmaris
mr
duncombe
chapter
xiv
now
yorke
the
carefully
brushed
exquisitely
shining
and
glossy
hat
the
city
man
god
as
it
has
been
called
fell
from
his
hands
and
he
flushed
and
then
turned
pale
but
that
perhaps
was
at
his
clumsiness
at
any
rate
whatever
the
cause
he
was
able
to
look
lady
eleanor
steadily
in
the
face
when
he
recovered
his
hat
portmaris
he
said
smoothing
it
with
his
sleeve
yes
i
know
it
it
is
a
small
fishing
village
on
the
west
coast
why
do
you
ask
and
his
keen
eyes
grew
to
her
face
oh
i
only
heard
of
it
the
other
day
she
said
a
friend
of
mine
the
duke
of
rothbury
has
gone
down
there
and
she
paused
a
moment
and
lord
auchester
has
been
there
lord
auchester
he
said
and
his
brows
knit
thoughtfully
it
is
a
strange
place
for
a
man
about
town
like
lord
auchester
to
stay
at
he
has
been
fishing
there
is
no
fishing
there
he
remarked
and
he
put
one
glove
on
and
took
it
off
again
the
frown
still
on
his
face
he
has
been
to
see
the
duke
you
may
know
that
the
duke
and
he
are
great
friends
they
are
cousins
he
shook
his
head
with
an
impatience
strange
and
unusual
with
him
the
cool
city
man
i
know
very
little
about
such
persons
lady
eleanor
he
said
gravely
your
father
the
late
earl
was
the
only
nobleman
i
ever
knew
and
i
do
mean
to
be
offensive
i
ever
wanted
to
know
lady
eleanor
looked
at
him
with
faint
surprise
then
she
smiled
if
reports
speak
truly
you
are
likely
to
be
a
nobleman
yourself
some
day
duncombe
you
have
only
to
enter
parliament
he
shook
his
head
by
way
of
stopping
her
i
have
no
ambition
in
that
direction
lady
eleanor
he
said
almost
gloomily
i
am
a
man
of
business
and
care
nothing
for
titles
i
was
going
to
say
and
for
little
else
but
i
suppose
that
would
be
true
i
do
care
for
money
i
been
bred
to
that
is
there
anything
else
you
would
like
to
say
to
me
he
broke
off
abruptly
his
manner
was
so
singular
so
unlike
his
usual
one
that
lady
eleanor
was
startled
thank
you
no
she
said
except
except
that
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
get
any
other
bills
or
debts
of
lord
auchester
he
nodded
certainly
he
brushed
his
hat
slowly
then
added
excuse
me
lady
eleanor
but
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
why
you
are
purchasing
and
at
a
heavy
price
lord
auchester
liabilities
i
am
aware
that
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
the
question
yes
you
have
she
said
quickly
and
struggling
with
the
color
that
would
mount
to
her
face
you
were
my
father
friend
and
have
been
and
are
mine
and
you
have
every
right
to
ask
such
questions
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
answer
well
lord
auchester
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
would
rather
that
he
owed
me
the
money
than
a
lot
of
jews
and
people
of
that
kind
ralph
duncombe
inclined
his
head
with
an
air
of
you
know
your
own
business
better
than
any
one
else
lady
eleanor
he
said
i
will
do
as
you
wish
and
please
say
nothing
about
this
mining
scheme
of
ours
he
got
outside
the
house
and
drew
a
long
breath
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
portmaris
had
stirred
his
heart
to
its
depths
and
recalled
leslie
and
his
parting
scene
with
her
he
might
aspire
to
nobility
might
he
what
would
be
the
good
of
a
title
to
him
when
the
only
title
he
longed
for
was
that
of
leslie
lisle
husband
and
so
this
lord
auchester
had
been
at
portmaris
had
he
seen
leslie
had
he
spoken
to
her
it
was
not
unlikely
such
men
as
this
lord
yorke
auchester
would
be
sure
to
discover
a
beautiful
girl
like
leslie
and
make
acquaintance
with
her
ralph
duncombe
spent
a
very
bad
on
the
underground
on
his
way
back
to
the
city
very
bad
five
minutes
after
the
man
of
business
had
left
palace
gardens
yorke
the
man
of
pleasure
arrived
there
and
was
welcomed
as
if
he
were
the
great
lama
of
thibet
i
have
had
time
to
change
my
habit
yorke
said
lady
eleanor
you
could
put
on
anything
prettier
he
said
with
that
fatal
facility
of
his
and
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
lady
eleanor
never
appeared
to
greater
advantage
than
in
the
dark
green
habit
upon
which
redfern
had
bestowed
his
most
finished
art
come
in
to
luncheon
at
once
she
said
it
is
the
only
way
of
stopping
your
compliments
here
is
aunt
denby
in
a
complete
quandary
as
to
whether
there
is
anything
fit
to
eat
you
know
we
women
do
care
what
we
get
but
it
is
different
with
you
men
but
the
luncheon
was
perfect
in
its
way
clear
soup
a
fish
pie
salmi
of
fowl
and
oh
wonderful
cook
lobster
cutlets
and
the
famous
claret
yorke
did
full
justice
to
the
good
fare
and
rattled
away
for
the
amusement
of
the
two
women
he
talked
of
the
opera
of
the
next
meeting
at
sandown
of
anything
and
everything
which
would
interest
two
women
moving
in
the
circles
and
made
himself
so
pleasant
that
lady
denby
who
always
suspected
while
she
liked
him
relaxed
into
a
smile
and
lady
eleanor
was
beaming
never
get
cutlets
like
these
anywhere
else
he
said
helping
himself
to
a
second
serve
with
a
contented
sigh
not
at
portmaris
asked
lady
eleanor
he
held
his
fork
aloft
and
looked
at
her
with
sudden
gravity
eh
oh
portmaris
no
no
lobster
cutlets
down
there
i
rather
think
they
eat
the
lobsters
raw
what
an
outlandish
place
it
must
be
said
lady
eleanor
i
wonder
how
you
could
stay
there
you
and
dolph
oh
anything
for
a
change
he
said
carelessly
but
with
his
mind
apparently
fixed
on
his
plate
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
could
see
leslie
face
as
plainly
as
if
she
were
standing
before
him
the
lunch
was
over
at
last
it
had
seemed
interminable
to
lady
eleanor
and
lady
denby
had
with
a
murmur
of
an
afternoon
drive
taken
herself
away
and
left
the
coast
clear
you
want
to
smoke
said
lady
eleanor
come
into
the
conservatory
aunt
does
mind
it
there
as
it
kills
the
insects
he
lit
a
cigar
and
lounged
against
the
doorway
and
she
sank
into
a
seat
and
absently
picked
the
blossoms
nearest
to
her
now
is
the
time
he
thought
to
tell
her
everything
but
at
the
moment
he
remembered
the
bracelet
which
the
duke
had
given
him
for
her
and
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
it
out
by
the
way
eleanor
he
said
carelessly
you
had
a
birthday
the
other
day
yes
i
think
i
had
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
do
you
remember
it
well
i
should
if
it
had
been
for
dolph
he
said
honestly
dolph
always
remembers
you
know
yes
i
know
and
so
so
he
took
the
morocco
case
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
and
so
well
i
know
it
is
worth
your
acceptance
but
if
you
care
to
take
it
here
a
trifle
dolph
gave
me
he
added
honestly
and
he
held
out
the
bracelet
she
took
it
and
her
face
brightened
brightened
with
a
soft
glow
which
made
it
look
inexpressibly
tender
and
grateful
how
good
of
you
how
pretty
it
is
and
it
is
just
the
size
see
and
she
unbuttoned
the
habit
sleeve
and
slipped
the
bracelet
on
how
does
it
fasten
eh
he
said
oh
like
this
i
expect
and
he
closed
the
spring
and
fastened
it
over
her
slender
wrist
and
the
touch
of
his
hand
sent
a
thrill
through
her
though
he
performed
the
operation
in
a
most
way
how
very
good
of
you
say
rather
of
dolph
he
said
it
was
he
who
gave
it
to
me
for
you
but
it
was
you
who
gave
it
to
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
told
him
you
would
care
for
it
he
said
you
who
have
no
end
of
presents
but
none
i
value
more
than
this
she
said
her
voice
singing
so
to
speak
i
will
always
wear
it
do
he
said
better
wear
the
bracelet
that
goes
with
your
diamond
set
that
more
suitable
to
a
rich
person
than
this
though
hard
on
dolph
who
chose
it
and
paid
for
it
is
it
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
that
reminds
me
yorke
do
you
know
that
i
am
likely
to
be
richer
even
than
you
think
oh
well
i
very
glad
he
said
with
friendly
interest
and
pleasure
what
will
you
do
with
so
much
coin
roll
in
it
she
sighed
softly
and
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
for
a
moment
with
a
look
that
said
i
would
like
to
give
it
to
you
and
you
can
roll
in
it
or
fling
it
in
the
thames
or
play
ducks
and
drakes
with
it
or
anything
but
he
was
not
looking
at
her
and
did
not
see
the
appeal
of
the
soft
brown
eyes
there
is
one
thing
i
can
do
with
it
she
said
i
can
buy
your
horse
if
you
really
mean
selling
it
yorke
but
you
do
but
i
do
he
said
quickly
and
with
a
touch
of
red
showing
through
his
tan
i
going
to
cut
down
my
establishment
big
word
is
it
as
low
as
it
can
be
cut
and
the
horse
has
got
to
go
then
i
will
buy
it
she
said
her
face
flushing
and
then
going
pale
why
was
he
selling
it
what
was
he
going
to
do
surely
nothing
rash
he
was
not
going
to
marry
no
she
drew
a
long
breath
that
was
impossible
he
could
marry
with
those
debts
hanging
round
his
neck
and
those
awful
bills
which
she
held
unless
he
married
an
heiress
and
in
that
case
he
would
not
want
to
sell
his
horse
an
old
and
loving
favorite
you
he
said
why
should
you
buy
it
you
got
enough
already
besides
he
not
altogether
safe
thank
you
she
said
laughing
a
little
tremulously
it
is
the
first
time
my
horsemanship
has
been
called
in
question
i
not
afraid
of
peter
besides
i
i
should
like
to
have
him
to
put
under
a
glass
case
yes
that
i
might
look
at
him
and
recall
the
many
jolly
rides
we
have
had
together
no
no
one
shall
have
peter
but
me
you
ca
prevent
my
buying
him
you
know
no
he
said
and
i
rather
you
had
him
than
any
one
else
i
should
see
him
occasionally
and
i
think
i
could
make
him
quiet
enough
for
you
perhaps
he
laughed
you
might
feel
enough
sometimes
to
lend
him
to
a
poor
chap
who
ca
afford
a
nag
of
his
own
yes
she
said
i
could
do
that
is
there
anything
i
would
lend
or
give
you
yorke
and
her
voice
was
almost
inaudible
he
started
and
looked
at
his
watch
how
was
he
to
tell
this
beautiful
woman
whose
eyes
were
melting
with
love
whose
voice
rang
with
it
that
he
had
no
love
to
return
that
he
had
indeed
given
his
whole
heart
to
another
woman
and
yet
that
was
what
he
meant
doing
this
morning
i
i
must
be
off
he
said
almost
nervously
she
rose
and
as
she
did
so
the
bracelet
which
he
must
have
fastened
insecurely
fell
to
the
ground
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
and
she
held
out
her
arm
that
a
bad
omen
is
it
she
said
with
a
wistful
smile
oh
no
he
replied
as
lightly
as
he
could
that
kind
of
thing
only
applies
to
rings
wedding
ones
in
particular
let
see
how
does
this
clasp
go
once
more
she
put
her
disengaged
hand
to
show
him
and
their
fingers
met
touched
and
got
entangled
and
he
laughed
but
the
laugh
died
away
as
he
saw
her
lips
quiver
as
if
with
pain
and
her
soft
eyes
fill
with
tears
he
got
outside
and
took
off
his
hat
and
drew
a
long
breath
i
could
as
soon
have
struck
her
as
told
her
he
muttered
and
that
was
how
he
was
with
the
old
love
no
he
went
down
to
the
club
and
sauntered
from
to
and
at
last
consented
to
play
a
game
at
billiards
with
a
man
with
whom
he
had
often
played
and
always
at
an
advantage
yorke
was
good
at
most
games
of
strength
or
skill
and
the
men
hearing
that
he
was
playing
dropped
in
and
sat
round
to
while
away
the
tedious
hour
before
dinner
but
that
afternoon
yorke
could
not
play
a
bit
completely
off
color
remarked
a
young
fellow
in
tones
of
almost
personal
resentment
never
saw
such
a
thing
there
that
the
second
easy
hazard
he
missed
and
bang
goes
my
sovereign
and
why
on
earth
does
he
keep
on
smoking
like
that
inquired
another
in
an
undertone
looks
as
if
he
were
mooning
about
something
he
be
be
the
first
young
fellow
shook
his
head
no
yorke
auchester
does
drink
if
that
what
you
mean
it
that
but
hang
me
if
i
know
what
it
is
yorke
he
called
out
you
ca
play
yorke
gave
a
little
start
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
reflective
smiles
eh
no
i
making
a
fool
of
myself
i
know
you
must
have
been
to
bed
early
wherever
you
been
for
the
last
week
suggested
one
of
the
men
and
they
were
all
surprised
to
see
him
flush
like
a
great
girl
by
jingo
yes
i
have
and
it
has
agreed
with
me
in
a
billiard
sense
he
said
good
temperedly
as
he
put
on
his
coat
and
sauntered
out
he
went
to
his
chambers
and
dressed
and
the
faithful
fleming
also
noticed
the
singular
fit
of
abstraction
which
had
fallen
upon
his
beloved
master
seems
to
have
something
on
his
mind
was
his
mental
reflection
and
it
does
look
as
if
it
was
bills
or
anything
unpleasant
of
that
kind
shall
i
wait
up
my
lord
he
asked
as
he
put
on
the
perfectly
cut
dress
overcoat
and
handed
the
speckless
flawless
hat
he
had
to
put
the
question
twice
and
even
then
yorke
did
not
seem
to
catch
the
sense
of
it
immediately
eh
no
do
sit
up
i
may
be
late
and
by
the
way
i
may
be
off
to
the
country
morning
so
have
some
things
packed
something
up
at
that
outlandish
place
he
been
staying
at
was
fleming
mental
comment
and
he
watched
his
master
go
slowly
down
the
stairs
with
the
faint
flicker
of
a
smile
on
his
handsome
face
yorke
dined
at
the
club
and
for
once
seemed
quite
indifferent
as
to
what
he
ate
and
when
the
footman
brought
the
wrong
claret
took
it
without
a
word
of
reproach
some
of
his
friends
watched
him
from
an
adjacent
table
and
shook
their
heads
somebody
gone
and
died
and
left
him
a
hatful
of
coin
or
else
won
a
big
wager
never
saw
yorke
auchester
go
dreaming
over
his
dinner
in
his
life
before
was
the
remark
about
nine
he
lit
a
cigar
and
walked
down
to
the
diadem
the
attendants
even
the
men
in
the
orchestra
knew
him
and
people
pointed
him
out
to
each
other
as
his
stalwart
figure
made
its
way
to
his
stall
and
when
finetta
sprang
onto
the
stage
in
her
dainty
page
dress
of
scarlet
and
black
satin
the
man
who
always
knows
everything
about
the
actors
and
actresses
whispered
to
a
country
cousin
that
finetta
look
you
see
her
glance
toward
him
and
perhaps
give
a
little
nod
they
say
he
spent
every
penny
of
an
enormous
fortune
in
diamonds
for
her
got
some
of
on
etc
as
a
matter
of
fact
finetta
saw
him
without
any
direct
glance
and
saw
nothing
else
it
was
said
that
she
danced
her
best
that
night
and
the
house
stamped
and
cheered
with
delight
but
as
yorke
looked
at
her
and
clapped
he
thought
poor
fin
it
wo
be
hard
to
leave
her
and
the
remembrance
of
the
laugh
he
had
heard
at
martin
tower
rose
and
made
him
shudder
he
lit
a
cigar
after
the
theater
and
set
out
to
walk
to
john
wood
as
the
page
opened
the
door
finetta
had
two
both
as
well
appointed
and
trained
as
any
of
lady
eleanor
yorke
heard
the
sound
of
laughter
and
music
in
the
and
above
it
all
laugh
it
made
him
shudder
once
more
supper
was
nearly
over
a
dainty
supper
with
ice
puddings
and
the
best
brands
of
champagne
and
some
one
at
the
piano
was
dashing
out
with
the
true
artistic
touch
the
popular
song
from
the
late
comic
opera
and
some
of
the
guests
were
singing
it
there
were
three
or
four
men
lord
vinson
was
among
them
and
and
as
many
ladies
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
finetta
she
was
magnificently
dressed
in
a
cream
silk
soft
and
undulating
a
crimson
rose
was
her
only
ornament
and
that
worn
in
the
thick
glossy
hair
she
knew
yorke
taste
too
well
to
smother
herself
in
diamonds
and
she
knew
also
that
the
soft
cream
and
the
rich
red
rose
showed
up
her
dark
spanish
complexion
as
no
other
colors
could
do
her
eyes
lit
up
as
he
entered
and
she
signed
to
him
to
take
a
chair
next
her
i
knew
you
come
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
never
break
a
promise
polly
give
lord
auchester
some
gelatine
or
what
will
you
have
he
took
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
wine
and
joined
in
with
the
talk
it
was
not
very
witty
but
it
was
not
dull
the
men
talked
of
the
theater
the
turf
and
talked
a
great
deal
better
and
more
fluently
than
they
did
at
respectable
dinner
parties
and
every
now
and
then
one
of
them
was
asked
to
sing
and
did
so
cheerfully
and
willingly
and
as
a
rule
sang
well
and
the
rest
made
a
chorus
if
it
was
needed
with
the
exception
that
no
one
looked
or
was
bored
and
all
tried
to
make
themselves
pleasant
and
agreeable
it
differed
very
little
from
the
dinners
and
suppers
which
we
the
most
respectable
of
readers
so
often
yawn
over
finetta
said
but
little
sang
one
song
only
and
was
so
silent
and
quiet
and
subdued
that
lord
vinson
as
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
whispered
to
yorke
on
passing
look
out
for
squalls
old
fellow
she
most
dangerous
when
she
like
this
do
you
know
when
they
had
all
gone
but
yorke
and
polly
had
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
inner
room
and
taken
out
some
lace
of
her
sister
to
mend
finetta
lit
a
cigarette
for
yorke
and
then
going
to
the
piano
began
to
play
she
had
learned
to
play
a
little
the
air
to
which
she
danced
her
great
dance
then
she
moved
way
and
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
anything
but
the
silent
young
man
with
the
look
on
his
face
and
humming
the
air
musically
enough
glided
into
the
dance
itself
surely
since
taglioni
there
has
been
no
more
graceful
dancer
than
finetta
and
even
yorke
with
his
heart
soaring
miles
away
to
the
girl
who
owned
it
could
not
but
look
and
admire
bravo
fin
he
said
almost
involuntarily
no
wonder
they
encore
that
every
night
do
leave
off
for
she
had
stopped
suddenly
right
in
front
of
him
her
dark
eyes
flashing
into
his
her
lips
apart
yes
she
said
i
am
not
going
to
dance
any
more
i
am
going
to
sit
here
and
listen
while
you
tell
me
everything
now
yorke
chapter
xv
finetta
learns
the
truth
now
tell
me
everything
repeated
finetta
and
she
drew
an
amber
satin
cushion
from
the
sofa
and
seated
herself
at
his
feet
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
her
dark
eyes
turned
up
to
him
now
here
was
the
way
ready
made
for
him
but
what
man
ever
answered
such
an
appeal
at
once
and
fully
yorke
took
the
cigarette
from
his
lips
and
looked
down
at
her
with
a
troubled
surprise
what
do
you
mean
he
said
how
do
you
know
there
is
anything
to
tell
she
laughed
almost
contemptuously
how
do
you
know
when
it
going
to
rain
by
the
clouds
do
you
do
you
think
i
blind
yorke
i
not
clever
like
some
of
your
swell
friends
but
i
not
a
fool
i
got
eyes
like
other
women
and
perhaps
they
sharper
than
some
and
i
can
see
something
is
the
matter
i
saw
it
the
moment
i
rode
up
to
you
in
the
park
and
i
been
watching
you
all
the
evening
you
make
a
decent
detective
fin
he
said
trying
to
speak
banteringly
i
dare
say
she
assented
most
women
would
especially
if
they
knew
the
man
they
were
after
as
well
as
i
know
you
yes
we
are
old
friends
fin
he
said
that
it
she
said
and
that
why
i
ask
you
what
the
matter
what
happened
some
men
would
push
me
off
or
give
me
the
lie
but
you
are
like
that
sort
thanks
and
he
laughed
no
you
always
go
straight
and
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
like
you
do
you
see
i
see
he
said
and
so
you
thought
i
looked
this
morning
as
if
got
something
on
my
mind
she
nodded
yes
when
i
came
up
you
were
leaning
against
the
rail
looking
at
nothing
as
if
you
were
dreaming
and
while
you
were
speaking
to
lady
eleanor
he
moved
slightly
you
do
like
me
to
speak
of
her
she
said
with
a
quickness
all
right
i
hurt
her
by
mentioning
her
name
do
be
foolish
fin
he
said
coloring
at
the
truth
of
her
insight
he
did
not
like
to
hear
her
mention
lady
eleanor
name
oh
i
not
foolish
i
was
saying
that
you
looked
at
her
ladyship
just
as
you
looked
at
me
as
if
you
did
see
either
of
us
as
if
you
were
looking
right
away
beyond
us
and
it
been
the
same
you
have
heard
half
that
was
going
on
but
have
just
been
mooning
and
dreaming
and
so
i
ask
you
what
it
is
wait
a
minute
if
going
to
tell
me
that
it
money
matters
you
need
for
i
believe
you
if
the
bailiffs
were
in
the
house
you
would
let
it
trouble
you
you
know
he
laughed
i
am
afraid
i
should
he
admitted
very
well
she
said
then
it
is
that
though
you
are
hard
up
and
pretty
deep
in
debt
eh
yorke
of
course
he
said
always
have
been
and
shall
be
everybody
knows
that
and
so
you
used
to
it
and
do
mind
it
she
went
on
it
that
then
what
is
it
he
was
silent
struggling
hard
for
courage
to
tell
her
you
do
like
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
she
said
slowly
and
you
think
it
like
my
cheek
to
ask
you
but
i
an
old
friend
am
i
not
i
only
finetta
the
girl
that
dances
at
the
diadem
but
got
a
feeling
that
i
a
better
friend
to
you
than
many
of
your
swell
ones
i
dare
say
they
think
i
a
bad
lot
and
that
i
done
you
no
end
of
harm
perhaps
i
have
i
let
you
come
here
when
you
liked
and
take
me
about
riding
and
driving
when
you
ought
to
have
been
with
them
but
i
do
know
after
all
that
i
hurt
you
much
i
dare
say
i
could
if
i
liked
you
have
given
me
things
like
charlie
farquhar
if
i
let
you
but
i
did
i
was
a
fool
perhaps
sometimes
i
think
i
am
but
but
you
see
i
liked
you
i
did
care
for
the
others
they
were
nothing
to
me
and
it
would
have
mattered
if
they
spent
their
last
shilling
in
rings
and
flowers
and
things
but
with
you
it
was
different
i
do
know
quite
why
and
her
eyes
sank
thoughtfully
perhaps
it
was
because
you
always
treated
me
like
a
lady
and
bother
me
to
run
off
with
you
or
or
marry
you
her
voice
softened
and
a
dash
of
color
came
into
her
olive
cheeks
you
have
made
a
poor
bargain
if
i
had
and
you
consented
fin
he
said
gravely
i
dare
say
she
assented
anyhow
you
did
and
do
mean
to
do
deny
it
i
know
how
you
always
thought
of
me
i
been
just
finetta
of
the
diadem
and
it
been
pleasant
and
amusing
to
take
me
about
and
come
and
have
supper
and
and
that
all
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
with
a
smile
a
brave
smile
that
did
not
hide
her
aching
heart
from
him
and
we
been
such
very
good
friends
she
went
on
after
a
pause
that
i
speak
out
straight
and
plain
when
i
see
that
something
is
the
matter
and
i
ask
you
what
it
is
and
if
you
take
my
advice
tell
me
who
knows
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
if
you
want
any
help
do
laugh
what
that
story
about
the
lion
and
the
mouse
i
only
a
mouse
i
know
and
you
are
no
end
of
a
lion
but
you
may
find
yourself
in
a
net
some
day
do
you
know
her
tone
was
slangy
but
there
was
an
earnestness
in
it
and
in
her
dark
eyes
which
touched
yorke
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
said
in
a
voice
inaudible
to
polly
who
stolidly
stitched
and
stitched
in
the
inner
room
you
are
right
fin
something
has
happened
i
knew
it
she
said
quietly
he
screwed
his
courage
up
the
fact
is
fin
i
am
going
to
be
married
he
said
almost
in
a
whisper
she
did
not
start
did
not
move
a
muscle
for
a
moment
then
she
got
up
wait
a
minute
i
want
a
cigarette
she
crossed
the
room
to
an
inlaid
cabinet
and
took
out
a
silver
box
of
course
a
present
and
got
a
cigarette
from
it
and
her
hand
shook
so
that
for
a
moment
she
could
not
hold
the
match
straight
but
when
she
glided
back
to
her
place
at
his
feet
her
hand
was
steady
and
seeing
that
his
face
was
rather
pale
she
showed
no
sign
of
emotion
either
of
surprise
or
anger
or
resentment
going
to
be
married
she
said
leaning
back
to
lady
eleanor
i
suppose
no
said
yorke
emphatically
why
should
you
think
that
he
was
relieved
greatly
relieved
by
the
quiet
way
in
which
she
had
taken
the
announcement
and
man
like
was
completely
deceived
oh
i
do
know
everybody
said
you
were
going
to
marry
her
she
has
plenty
of
money
and
is
a
swell
so
it
not
her
she
said
slowly
her
eyes
downcast
no
it
is
not
he
responded
and
there
no
reason
why
people
should
say
he
stopped
oh
they
say
it
because
you
and
she
are
so
much
together
and
made
love
to
her
but
that
means
nothing
with
you
does
it
she
said
shooting
a
glance
up
at
him
yorke
colored
if
a
man
to
marry
every
girl
he
flirts
with
he
said
all
right
i
do
mind
you
flirted
with
me
and
i
have
asked
you
to
marry
me
and
so
it
not
her
ladyship
a
faint
smile
curved
her
lips
which
looked
drawn
and
constrained
what
other
swell
is
it
i
know
all
by
sight
she
is
not
a
at
all
he
said
and
you
do
not
know
her
i
only
saw
her
the
other
day
down
in
the
country
where
you
have
been
this
last
week
she
said
in
a
low
voice
perfectly
steady
and
under
control
yes
i
saw
her
met
her
by
chance
quite
by
chance
and
and
you
fell
in
love
with
her
right
off
she
said
yes
he
said
looking
straight
before
him
and
speaking
as
if
in
a
dream
i
loved
her
at
first
sight
she
must
be
very
he
smiled
absently
was
so
poor
a
phrase
by
which
to
describe
his
leslie
yes
she
is
as
you
call
it
fin
he
said
what
is
she
like
is
she
tall
and
fair
i
suppose
so
that
the
style
that
fetches
most
men
he
said
she
is
not
fair
not
what
one
would
call
fair
dark
and
she
flashed
her
brilliant
eyes
up
at
him
and
then
at
a
mirror
opposite
her
not
dark
i
think
i
ca
tell
her
hair
is
dark
as
mine
she
asked
he
looked
down
at
her
as
if
he
had
forgotten
the
color
of
her
hair
and
she
felt
the
look
like
a
dagger
stab
yes
but
she
has
blue
or
gray
eyes
she
nodded
i
knew
she
said
shortly
as
if
it
cost
her
something
to
speak
i
know
the
sort
of
girl
i
seen
dark
hair
and
eyes
yes
and
you
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
and
why
do
you
go
on
i
want
to
know
all
about
her
and
she
laughed
in
his
abstraction
he
did
not
detect
the
tone
of
agony
of
jealousy
in
the
laugh
and
only
thought
how
well
finetta
was
behaving
and
what
a
brick
she
was
there
not
much
more
to
tell
he
said
i
i
told
her
that
i
loved
her
and
and
he
paused
recalling
the
tender
the
precious
confession
of
his
darling
well
we
to
be
married
fin
as
soon
as
we
can
i
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
and
we
have
much
to
live
upon
but
i
dare
say
we
shall
get
on
somehow
or
other
anyhow
made
up
my
mind
and
he
stopped
no
one
not
the
devil
himself
could
stop
you
she
finished
not
passionately
but
in
a
slow
steady
voice
and
so
you
come
to
me
and
told
me
like
like
a
man
yorke
we
are
old
friends
fin
he
said
and
i
felt
you
ought
to
know
i
see
she
said
it
will
make
a
difference
to
us
wo
it
to
our
acquaintance
now
no
more
dinners
at
richmond
or
suppers
at
the
little
house
in
john
wood
it
would
do
for
a
man
who
is
going
to
be
married
to
be
friends
with
finetta
eh
oh
i
understand
and
much
obliged
to
you
fin
wait
i
speaking
the
truth
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
some
men
would
have
kept
it
to
themselves
would
have
cut
me
straight
away
without
a
word
and
left
me
to
find
out
the
reason
by
reading
the
accounts
of
the
wedding
in
the
newspapers
but
you
are
that
sort
are
you
yorke
or
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
lord
auchester
now
he
colored
and
bit
his
lip
hit
away
fin
he
said
i
deserve
it
no
she
said
i
wo
hit
you
though
i
dare
say
lady
eleanor
and
the
heaps
of
other
ladies
you
made
love
to
will
and
pretty
hard
but
i
am
not
a
lady
you
see
and
that
makes
a
difference
and
this
this
young
lady
you
say
she
not
a
swell
he
laughed
not
what
you
call
a
swell
fin
he
said
she
is
the
daughter
of
an
artist
and
not
a
one
at
that
an
artist
the
full
lips
writhed
into
an
expression
of
amazement
and
contempt
which
he
did
not
see
an
artist
one
of
those
fellows
who
paint
pictures
and
awfully
bad
ones
said
yorke
with
a
rueful
laugh
and
they
poor
they
are
certainly
not
rich
he
said
and
you
be
poor
too
you
and
she
when
when
you
married
he
laughed
rather
ruefully
again
i
know
the
sort
of
thing
she
said
with
all
the
scorn
of
one
who
has
passed
from
squalid
poverty
to
luxury
and
wealth
you
have
to
live
in
a
small
house
with
one
or
two
servants
you
wo
be
able
to
afford
a
valet
or
a
horse
excepting
a
well
you
want
that
as
i
dare
say
she
your
wife
will
have
to
do
the
washing
and
you
have
to
dine
like
a
workman
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
drink
cheap
ale
and
wear
shabby
clothes
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
seedy
clothes
yorke
you
look
funny
and
she
laughed
bitterly
and
she
wear
cheap
things
turned
dresses
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
she
get
dowdy
and
and
you
ask
yourself
what
on
earth
you
ever
saw
in
her
that
you
should
go
and
ruin
yourself
by
marrying
her
oh
i
know
and
she
leaned
back
and
puffed
at
her
cigarette
with
a
contempt
that
was
almost
imperial
yorke
colored
a
good
deal
of
what
you
say
is
true
but
not
all
fin
he
said
almost
gently
it
would
be
base
ingratitude
to
be
angry
with
her
after
the
admirable
way
in
which
she
had
received
the
news
for
one
thing
leslie
would
never
be
dowdy
you
understand
that
if
you
knew
her
had
seen
her
i
suppose
she
wears
cheap
clothes
now
if
so
all
i
can
say
is
that
she
looks
as
well
as
refined
and
as
as
anybody
i
know
as
lady
eleanor
she
put
in
with
a
flash
of
her
dark
eyes
well
yes
he
assented
and
for
another
thing
she
would
get
it
is
possible
oh
is
it
with
another
curl
of
the
lip
no
he
said
quietly
earnestly
i
go
bail
for
that
much
and
i
stake
my
life
i
shall
never
ask
myself
why
i
married
her
but
you
right
about
a
great
deal
of
it
fin
and
we
shall
have
to
put
up
with
it
after
all
you
know
you
ca
have
everything
you
want
in
this
world
did
you
ever
notice
that
the
rich
people
the
people
with
hatfuls
of
money
generally
look
the
most
wretched
i
have
they
want
something
they
have
got
you
may
depend
upon
it
something
they
value
ever
so
much
higher
than
their
coin
well
we
shall
want
money
but
we
shall
have
a
good
many
other
things
she
laughed
a
dry
harsh
laugh
do
mind
me
she
said
i
ca
help
smiling
it
as
good
as
a
play
to
hear
you
talking
like
the
leading
juvenile
in
a
sentimental
piece
love
love
love
that
what
you
thinking
of
well
perhaps
you
right
god
knows
i
dare
say
you
right
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
and
when
the
wedding
to
be
soon
he
said
dreamily
as
soon
as
possible
it
a
secret
i
mean
our
engagement
she
looked
up
sharply
oh
it
is
in
the
papers
or
known
yet
he
shook
his
head
no
no
we
reasons
for
keeping
it
quiet
for
a
little
while
but
you
came
and
told
me
she
said
broodingly
well
it
was
straight
and
kind
of
you
as
i
said
and
and
i
much
obliged
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
in
acknowledgment
she
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
as
if
she
doubted
whether
she
would
take
it
then
she
put
her
own
into
it
and
hers
burned
like
a
coal
she
took
it
away
instantly
and
rose
and
walked
slowly
up
to
the
table
poured
out
a
couple
of
glasses
of
champagne
and
brought
him
one
and
raised
the
other
to
her
lips
here
luck
to
you
both
she
said
with
a
laugh
may
you
be
happy
ever
afterward
as
they
say
in
the
story
books
and
she
looked
over
the
rim
of
the
glass
at
him
with
her
dark
eyes
flashing
under
the
thick
brows
thanks
fin
he
said
you
are
a
good
sort
and
he
rose
but
you
do
want
to
know
any
more
of
me
she
broke
in
i
understand
oh
do
apologize
i
cute
enough
to
see
why
you
told
me
why
you
come
to
me
first
of
all
there
to
be
an
end
to
our
friendship
her
voice
broke
for
a
moment
then
she
hurried
on
with
forced
gayety
and
indifference
and
you
quite
right
a
man
going
to
settle
down
does
want
such
acquaintances
as
me
well
she
held
out
her
hand
yorke
feeling
as
a
man
must
feel
under
such
circumstances
when
he
can
not
contradict
and
would
like
to
do
so
hung
his
head
for
a
moment
then
he
took
her
hand
and
holding
it
said
i
not
much
loss
fin
as
i
told
her
i
a
bad
lot
and
dear
at
any
price
and
there
then
he
did
a
foolish
thing
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
she
quivered
almost
as
if
he
had
struck
her
her
eyes
closed
and
she
leaned
heavily
against
the
edge
of
the
table
yorke
feeling
unutterably
miserable
dropped
her
hand
and
left
the
room
he
gave
the
page
who
helped
him
on
with
his
coat
a
sovereign
and
got
outside
poor
fin
he
muttered
standing
on
the
pavement
and
staring
about
him
poor
fin
and
so
he
got
off
with
the
old
love
number
two
finetta
stood
where
he
had
left
her
for
a
second
then
sprang
forward
with
her
magnificent
arms
stretched
out
yorke
yorke
broke
from
her
white
lips
but
the
door
had
closed
and
he
did
not
hear
her
she
stood
erect
for
a
moment
then
staggered
and
fell
face
downward
upon
the
sofa
polly
ran
to
her
locking
the
door
on
her
way
and
raised
her
head
she
had
fainted
polly
poured
some
wine
through
the
clenched
teeth
and
bathed
the
set
face
and
presently
finetta
came
to
but
it
was
to
pass
from
a
swoon
into
an
awful
torrent
of
weeping
he
gone
he
gone
forever
she
moaned
i
shall
never
see
him
again
why
did
i
let
him
go
like
that
why
did
i
ask
him
on
my
knees
to
let
us
be
friends
still
i
should
have
seen
him
now
and
again
and
that
would
have
been
something
to
speak
to
him
hear
him
laugh
and
talk
and
call
me
but
it
all
over
now
he
never
come
back
oh
i
wish
i
were
dead
dead
dead
hush
hush
implored
polly
trying
to
soothe
her
he
better
gone
there
was
no
good
in
his
staying
no
no
i
know
that
he
never
cared
for
me
i
only
amused
him
and
directly
he
left
me
he
forgot
me
they
all
alike
no
he
was
different
look
how
he
came
and
told
me
like
a
man
oh
yorke
yorke
oh
he
little
guesses
how
i
her
lips
shook
and
she
hid
her
face
even
from
her
sister
where
your
pride
fin
whispered
polly
almost
as
lady
denby
had
said
to
lady
eleanor
my
pride
retorted
finetta
ah
you
can
talk
like
that
you
who
do
know
what
i
feel
i
have
any
i
have
followed
him
round
the
world
like
a
dog
grateful
for
a
kind
word
or
a
blow
i
have
worked
for
him
like
a
slave
poor
he
need
have
been
poor
if
he
married
me
he
should
have
had
every
penny
and
i
have
been
content
to
go
in
rags
so
long
as
he
had
the
best
of
everything
and
i
have
made
him
happy
or
die
in
the
trying
you
most
likely
have
died
remarked
polly
with
a
woman
insight
i
dare
say
well
i
could
have
died
but
it
all
over
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
shook
like
a
leaf
for
a
full
minute
then
suddenly
her
mood
changed
and
she
started
up
in
a
fury
the
tears
dried
up
in
her
burning
eyes
her
face
became
white
her
lips
rigid
and
as
she
stood
with
clenched
hands
and
heaving
bosom
she
looked
like
an
outraged
goddess
a
tigress
robbed
of
her
cub
a
woman
despised
and
deserted
and
that
is
a
more
terrible
thing
than
the
outraged
goddess
or
the
bereaved
tigress
by
the
way
he
a
fool
she
panted
a
fool
to
leave
me
for
such
as
her
says
she
pretty
she
strode
to
the
glass
and
stood
erect
before
it
is
she
better
looking
than
i
am
i
do
believe
it
and
what
else
is
she
nothing
she
poor
she
is
a
swell
even
and
he
left
me
and
that
other
that
lady
eleanor
for
her
yes
i
could
have
borne
it
better
if
it
had
been
lady
eleanor
if
it
had
been
one
of
her
sort
it
would
be
more
natural
but
a
mere
nobody
the
daughter
of
an
artist
in
her
ignorance
poor
finetta
regarded
the
painters
of
pictures
and
gate
posts
as
equals
a
common
painter
why
he
better
have
married
me
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
i
as
good
as
she
is
and
she
be
a
lady
i
make
as
good
a
lady
as
she
would
you
never
saw
her
ventured
polly
timidly
the
tigress
swung
round
upon
her
dashing
the
wine
glasses
to
the
ground
in
the
movement
saw
her
i
do
want
to
see
her
to
know
what
she
like
i
can
guess
a
dowdy
simpering
chit
of
a
girl
that
caught
his
fancy
and
she
be
his
wife
while
i
she
raised
her
clenched
hands
above
her
head
and
laughed
a
wild
discordant
laugh
it
makes
me
mad
she
fell
to
pacing
the
room
her
hair
had
become
unfastened
and
fell
in
a
black
torrent
over
the
creamy
satin
her
lithe
figure
erect
and
quivering
looked
six
feet
high
a
magnificent
spectacle
for
a
painter
or
sculptor
but
not
for
the
man
or
woman
who
had
offended
her
i
flung
aside
as
not
fit
for
him
to
know
and
she
be
his
wife
i
wish
she
were
here
now
i
kill
her
oh
if
i
could
only
do
something
to
separate
them
if
i
could
only
come
between
them
she
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
and
hid
her
face
on
the
cushion
polly
went
up
to
her
you
wearing
yourself
out
fin
she
said
you
suffer
for
this
better
come
to
bed
besides
what
the
use
of
it
you
ca
bring
him
back
or
stop
his
marrying
the
other
girl
finetta
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
her
as
if
she
did
not
see
her
ca
i
she
muttered
between
her
closed
teeth
ca
i
i
know
such
things
have
been
done
sometimes
there
a
way
she
put
her
hand
to
her
brow
and
drew
a
labored
sigh
i
ca
think
my
like
lead
and
on
fire
and
my
heart
aching
when
did
he
say
the
wedding
was
to
be
soon
said
polly
what
the
use
finetta
held
up
her
hand
to
silence
her
go
to
bed
she
said
hoarsely
you
come
too
go
to
bed
get
out
of
my
sight
i
want
to
be
alone
to
think
to
think
there
must
be
some
way
to
stop
it
and
and
i
find
it
out
go
away
with
a
flash
of
her
somber
eyes
go
away
and
leave
me
best
alone
polly
awed
and
frightened
crept
to
the
door
but
as
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
back
she
heard
the
hoarse
broken
voice
still
muttering
there
must
be
some
way
chapter
xvi
the
foolish
note
yorke
walked
all
the
way
from
john
wood
to
bury
street
and
it
was
not
altogether
a
pleasant
walk
there
is
a
popular
parlor
game
called
consequences
and
after
a
fashion
he
was
playing
that
game
as
he
strode
along
smoking
vigorously
it
is
an
easy
and
pleasant
amusement
running
into
debt
but
there
are
consequences
it
is
also
an
easy
and
pleasant
matter
to
make
love
to
two
women
but
the
consequences
have
to
be
reckoned
with
and
the
reckoning
whether
it
come
sooner
or
later
is
a
serious
matter
he
had
never
loved
lady
eleanor
but
he
respected
and
liked
her
he
had
certainly
never
loved
finetta
but
he
had
liked
her
liked
her
very
much
and
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
silent
streets
his
heart
it
was
by
no
means
a
hard
one
was
filled
with
pity
and
remorse
it
was
playing
it
very
rough
to
go
and
tell
her
that
i
should
have
to
cut
her
that
she
was
fit
company
for
me
any
longer
but
what
else
could
i
do
i
could
cut
her
without
a
word
without
saying
he
mused
and
how
well
she
took
it
no
scene
no
fuss
no
reproaches
it
was
well
that
he
was
unable
to
see
finetta
at
that
moment
or
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
could
she
bore
it
like
a
brick
she
is
a
brick
most
women
of
her
class
would
have
raised
a
duse
of
a
row
and
made
it
hot
for
me
all
round
yes
fin
behaved
well
what
a
fool
i
have
been
what
fools
we
men
all
are
why
did
i
want
to
strike
up
a
friendship
with
finetta
of
the
diadem
and
yet
that
scarcely
the
fair
way
to
look
at
it
for
in
a
way
she
as
good
as
i
am
and
she
have
gone
a
hundred
miles
to
do
me
a
service
yes
and
have
shared
her
last
penny
with
me
i
know
that
poor
fin
thank
heaven
it
over
i
begin
a
new
life
from
please
god
a
life
devoted
to
my
darling
my
darling
heaven
it
scarcely
seems
true
that
she
is
mine
i
wonder
whether
she
is
asleep
perhaps
she
is
looking
up
at
these
small
stars
and
yes
i
hope
she
is
thinking
of
me
jove
it
like
having
a
guardian
angel
all
to
one
self
to
be
loved
by
such
a
woman
as
leslie
i
wish
i
were
more
worthy
of
her
i
wish
i
met
her
years
ago
what
a
time
i
seem
to
have
wasted
he
had
forgotten
finetta
long
before
he
reached
home
and
was
wrapped
up
heart
and
soul
in
leslie
and
looking
with
impatience
toward
the
hour
when
he
could
return
to
portmaris
he
would
have
gone
back
the
next
day
but
the
duke
had
asked
him
to
do
one
or
two
things
for
him
and
he
yorke
was
anxious
to
pay
some
bills
he
went
out
after
breakfast
and
his
first
call
was
at
a
grimy
office
in
a
dark
and
dingy
court
leading
out
of
lombard
street
this
was
the
parlor
of
a
certain
spider
called
levison
and
lord
yorke
was
not
the
first
fly
that
had
found
its
way
into
it
levison
was
a
grimy
man
with
a
hooked
nose
and
thick
lips
an
unctuous
smile
and
decidedly
israelite
accent
he
was
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
wore
a
scarlet
necktie
in
which
shone
an
enormous
diamond
pin
a
thick
gold
cable
albert
across
his
waistcoat
and
innumerable
rings
upon
his
fingers
which
called
unkind
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
latter
were
dirty
this
young
gentleman
greeted
lord
yorke
with
a
mixture
of
respect
and
familiarity
which
made
yorke
and
most
other
persons
feel
an
almost
irresistible
longing
to
kick
him
and
your
lordship
said
levison
with
a
smile
that
stretched
his
flexible
lips
from
ear
to
ear
it
ai
often
we
see
you
in
the
city
my
lord
more
the
pity
for
the
city
and
he
laughed
and
rubbed
his
hands
what
can
i
have
the
pleasure
of
doin
for
your
lordship
a
little
accommodation
i
eh
yorke
shook
his
head
thanks
no
levison
he
said
levison
appeared
to
be
surprised
no
oh
come
now
my
lord
not
want
a
little
money
you
joking
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
am
serious
said
yorke
as
pleasantly
as
he
could
i
do
want
any
money
in
fact
i
come
to
take
up
that
bill
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
he
took
out
his
in
which
were
lying
snugly
the
for
which
he
had
cashed
the
duke
check
now
it
is
generally
and
not
erroneously
supposed
that
a
jew
is
always
ready
and
glad
to
receive
money
but
levison
singular
to
relate
looked
neither
ready
nor
glad
he
stared
at
yorke
with
widely
opened
eyes
and
his
face
grew
first
red
and
then
pale
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
want
to
pay
off
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
my
lord
he
said
at
last
and
in
a
tone
almost
of
dismay
startles
you
does
it
said
yorke
with
a
smile
for
the
consternation
amused
him
it
is
rather
an
unexpected
and
extraordinary
proceeding
on
my
part
i
admit
but
get
the
bill
levison
and
he
began
to
separate
the
notes
the
jew
gazed
at
them
and
then
up
at
the
handsome
careless
face
and
lastly
at
the
ground
look
here
my
lord
he
said
thickly
there
really
ai
any
neshesity
for
you
to
go
and
inconvenience
yourself
there
ai
indeed
besides
he
had
turned
to
the
grimy
desk
and
consulted
a
grimy
account
book
the
bill
ai
due
there
no
call
to
pay
it
for
some
time
yet
i
know
at
least
i
thought
so
said
yorke
carelessly
but
i
got
some
money
and
i
thought
i
like
to
clear
off
something
of
what
i
owe
you
why
and
he
laughed
you
do
seem
inclined
to
take
it
the
matter
you
have
his
face
grew
grave
you
have
parted
with
the
bills
to
any
one
else
levison
levison
oily
face
grew
almost
pale
say
yellow
what
me
go
and
part
with
the
bills
of
a
customer
like
you
not
me
my
lord
likely
i
know
better
what
due
to
a
swell
like
your
lordship
very
well
then
said
yorke
take
my
money
and
let
me
have
it
please
yesh
yesh
certainly
if
your
lordship
insists
but
upon
my
sacred
honor
i
rather
lend
you
another
than
well
well
and
he
went
to
a
safe
and
fumbled
in
his
pocket
tut
tut
he
exclaimed
blessed
if
i
have
left
my
keys
at
my
brother
excuse
me
half
a
minute
will
you
my
lord
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
smoke
while
you
waiting
no
no
thanks
said
yorke
who
had
once
been
prevailed
upon
to
taste
levison
sherry
and
had
smelled
the
cigars
while
levison
had
been
smoking
them
look
sharp
my
cab
is
waiting
not
more
than
a
minute
said
levison
and
he
darted
out
down
the
street
and
full
pelt
into
rawlings
and
duncombe
ralph
duncombe
cool
grave
collected
a
contrast
to
the
flurried
israelite
looked
up
from
his
mishter
dunkombe
sir
gasped
levison
here
lord
horchester
come
to
take
up
that
bill
of
wonderful
ai
it
let
have
it
sharp
moses
i
would
have
him
know
i
sold
it
to
you
for
twice
the
money
and
he
suspects
something
ralph
duncombe
looked
down
at
the
letter
he
was
writing
finished
it
as
if
he
had
scarcely
heard
then
drew
a
book
toward
him
looked
at
it
and
said
the
bill
is
due
why
should
lord
auchester
want
to
pay
money
before
it
is
wanted
do
i
know
mad
anyhow
he
does
ralph
duncombe
thought
a
moment
then
he
pushed
the
book
from
him
and
looked
straight
at
the
anxious
face
before
him
he
can
not
have
the
bill
he
said
levison
gasped
what
he
can
not
have
it
it
suits
me
to
stick
by
it
till
it
is
due
oh
mishter
dunkombe
sir
what
the
meaning
of
that
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
a
mere
whim
on
my
part
perhaps
said
ralph
duncombe
coolly
impassively
what
are
you
to
say
say
anything
offer
to
lend
him
more
money
i
will
take
any
bill
he
gives
you
he
struck
the
gong
standing
at
his
elbow
and
levison
feeling
too
bewildered
to
expostulate
or
argue
was
shown
out
he
went
back
slowly
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
if
it
were
known
that
he
had
parted
with
lord
auchester
bills
he
would
probably
get
a
bad
name
with
the
other
and
lose
half
of
them
as
customers
his
business
would
be
ruined
he
forced
a
grin
as
he
entered
the
office
and
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
beautiful
gesture
of
amazement
heresh
a
go
my
lord
he
exclaimed
brother
gone
off
to
see
a
client
in
the
country
and
took
them
confounded
keys
of
mine
with
him
but
there
it
do
matter
for
a
day
or
two
does
it
i
send
the
bill
or
call
on
your
lordship
yorke
put
his
back
very
well
he
said
mind
i
want
to
pay
the
money
while
i
got
it
you
see
the
jew
grinned
i
see
before
it
melts
eh
my
lord
but
there
as
i
said
why
pay
at
all
why
not
let
me
lend
you
yorke
shook
his
head
and
laughed
no
thanks
levison
i
do
mean
to
trouble
you
in
that
way
again
if
i
can
help
it
and
with
a
pleasant
nod
he
went
out
of
the
grimy
parlor
leaving
the
spider
staring
after
him
with
unfeigned
surprise
do
want
to
borrow
any
more
money
he
gasped
why
what
in
the
name
of
moses
has
come
to
him
he
he
must
be
going
off
his
yorke
dismissed
the
little
incident
from
his
mind
guessing
nothing
of
its
significance
or
the
effect
it
would
have
on
his
future
and
had
himself
driven
to
bond
street
he
had
commenced
the
morning
by
doing
his
duty
or
trying
to
do
it
and
now
he
was
going
to
reward
himself
by
buying
a
present
for
leslie
he
had
pondered
over
what
he
should
get
and
had
at
first
naturally
thought
of
a
ring
but
he
had
remembered
that
she
could
not
wear
it
without
attracting
notice
and
question
and
had
decided
on
a
locket
the
man
showed
him
some
and
yorke
selected
a
plain
one
with
the
initial
prettily
worked
in
while
he
was
paying
for
it
the
shopman
who
knew
him
quite
well
brought
forward
a
tray
of
diamond
ornaments
the
newest
designs
my
lord
he
said
yorke
shook
his
head
but
even
as
he
did
so
finetta
flashed
across
his
mind
he
looked
at
the
bundle
of
notes
he
had
plenty
of
money
she
had
behaved
remarkably
well
she
deserved
a
present
a
parting
gift
he
would
give
her
one
he
knew
finetta
passion
for
diamonds
and
comforted
himself
with
the
reflection
a
wrong
one
as
we
know
that
they
would
console
her
for
the
loss
of
him
he
was
not
long
in
choosing
not
half
as
long
as
he
had
been
in
selecting
leslie
simple
locket
and
purchased
a
pendant
it
cost
him
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
shall
i
send
them
my
lord
asked
the
man
no
said
york
i
take
put
them
up
singly
in
a
box
going
to
send
them
through
the
post
the
man
inclosed
them
in
a
couple
of
wooden
boxes
and
bowed
lord
auchester
out
york
went
home
and
straight
to
a
drawer
in
which
he
kept
odd
things
and
after
some
amount
of
rummaging
found
a
de
portrait
of
himself
he
sat
down
lit
a
cigar
and
as
neatly
as
he
could
cut
out
the
head
of
the
portrait
and
fitted
it
in
the
locket
wrote
on
a
slip
of
paper
from
yorke
and
laid
them
aside
then
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
dashed
off
in
the
charming
scrawl
which
boys
acquire
at
eton
and
never
lose
the
following
note
dear
will
you
accept
the
inclosed
and
wear
it
for
the
sake
and
in
remembrance
of
the
many
delightful
times
we
have
spent
together
i
thought
of
you
nearly
all
the
way
home
last
night
it
was
awfully
late
and
shall
never
forget
how
good
you
have
always
been
to
me
think
of
me
sometimes
when
you
wear
this
trifle
and
do
think
too
unkindly
yours
yorke
it
was
a
foolish
note
but
he
would
be
a
wise
man
who
could
write
a
wise
one
under
such
circumstances
of
course
a
wise
one
would
have
written
at
all
but
yorke
was
not
famous
for
prudence
he
laid
this
note
beside
the
beautiful
diamond
pendant
wrapped
like
the
locket
in
tissue
paper
and
was
putting
them
in
their
respective
boxes
when
fleming
came
in
lord
vinson
my
lord
he
said
yorke
looked
up
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
on
his
face
oh
ask
lord
vinson
to
wait
a
moment
he
said
hurriedly
a
midday
post
for
the
country
is
there
yes
my
lord
said
fleming
can
i
help
your
lordship
for
yorke
was
hunting
about
for
string
and
sealing
wax
no
yes
here
wrap
these
boxes
up
in
thickish
paper
and
seal
the
string
mind
this
no
goes
in
this
one
and
that
no
in
that
understand
yes
my
lord
said
fleming
and
no
doubt
he
thought
he
did
but
when
he
brought
them
back
from
the
side
table
at
which
he
had
been
packing
them
and
lord
yorke
asked
him
which
was
no
fleming
the
usually
careful
and
correct
handed
him
no
and
so
it
happened
that
when
a
few
minutes
later
fleming
walked
off
with
them
to
the
the
locket
with
the
portrait
but
with
finetta
letter
was
directed
to
finetta
and
the
diamond
pendant
to
leslie
chapter
xvii
a
word
of
warning
to
leslie
the
days
seemed
to
go
by
like
a
dream
during
yorke
absence
she
thought
of
him
every
hour
but
she
had
yet
scarcely
realized
all
that
had
happened
to
her
if
francis
lisle
had
not
been
utterly
unlike
the
ordinary
run
of
parents
he
would
not
have
failed
to
see
the
change
that
had
come
over
her
but
he
was
too
absorbed
in
his
painting
to
notice
the
difference
and
indeed
if
leslie
had
appeared
at
breakfast
in
a
domino
and
mask
or
sat
during
the
meal
with
an
umbrella
up
he
would
very
likely
have
failed
to
see
anything
extraordinary
in
the
occurrence
and
it
rather
suited
him
than
otherwise
that
leslie
should
sit
beside
him
perfectly
silent
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
with
a
dreamy
smile
on
her
lips
but
if
francis
lisle
was
blind
the
duke
was
not
his
keen
eyes
noted
the
change
in
the
expression
of
the
lovely
face
the
soft
light
of
a
newly
born
joy
in
the
gray
eyes
and
he
guessed
the
cause
like
the
rest
he
thought
with
the
bitter
cynicism
produced
by
his
pain
like
the
rest
well
it
will
afford
me
a
little
amusement
it
will
be
a
played
for
my
special
benefit
and
yet
at
times
when
he
was
free
from
pain
and
he
looked
up
at
leslie
as
she
stood
beside
his
chair
he
felt
doubtful
and
uncertain
as
to
the
accuracy
of
his
judgment
of
her
she
has
the
eyes
of
an
angel
he
muttered
when
they
were
together
one
morning
the
second
after
yorke
departure
for
london
one
would
say
that
they
were
the
clear
windows
of
a
soul
as
pure
as
a
child
his
muttering
was
almost
audible
and
leslie
awakened
by
it
from
a
dream
bent
down
to
him
and
asked
what
did
you
say
mr
temple
i
was
saying
and
thinking
that
you
are
very
to
keep
a
crusty
irritable
invalid
company
on
such
a
delightful
morning
did
you
say
all
that
she
said
with
a
soft
laugh
well
if
i
did
say
it
i
thought
it
he
responded
you
must
find
it
dull
work
but
you
are
used
to
sacrificing
yourself
for
others
are
you
not
and
he
glanced
at
the
painter
who
was
at
work
at
a
little
distance
on
the
beach
it
is
not
much
of
a
sacrifice
to
stay
with
those
one
likes
she
said
half
absently
the
duke
looked
up
at
her
sharply
and
yet
with
a
touch
of
color
on
his
face
thank
you
i
am
to
take
it
that
you
rather
like
me
than
otherwise
miss
leslie
she
blushed
and
eyed
him
with
sweet
gravity
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
if
i
did
not
she
said
and
mentally
she
added
and
how
could
i
help
liking
you
you
are
his
friend
i
see
he
said
well
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
keep
me
company
i
should
have
missed
my
cousin
the
duke
very
much
if
you
had
not
been
here
i
am
afraid
mine
is
dull
society
after
his
and
that
you
miss
the
pleasant
drives
and
sails
they
were
very
pleasant
yes
she
admitted
a
little
confusedly
how
hard
it
was
that
she
should
be
obliged
to
deceive
this
friend
of
yorke
and
how
she
longed
for
the
time
when
he
and
her
father
should
know
her
and
yorke
blissful
secrets
when
all
concealment
should
be
at
an
end
and
her
great
happiness
proclaimed
and
yet
it
was
sweet
this
secret
of
theirs
it
seemed
to
make
their
love
more
precious
and
sacred
yes
said
the
duke
yorke
is
capital
company
he
is
a
great
favorite
wherever
he
goes
yes
she
murmured
he
so
went
on
the
duke
and
people
are
extremely
rare
nowadays
but
after
all
it
is
very
much
to
his
credit
i
mean
that
it
is
easy
to
be
joyous
when
you
are
young
in
perfect
health
and
are
he
paused
a
second
a
duke
are
dukes
so
much
happier
than
other
people
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
he
winced
she
had
unconsciously
struck
home
no
he
said
laconically
most
of
those
i
know
are
very
much
less
happy
than
the
rest
of
mankind
but
it
is
different
with
the
duke
of
rothbury
he
is
as
i
say
young
and
in
splendid
health
his
lips
moved
and
he
sighed
cynically
but
if
he
were
he
would
still
be
very
popular
and
always
welcome
everywhere
why
said
leslie
looking
at
him
with
her
guileless
eyes
he
met
their
glance
for
a
moment
then
lowered
his
keen
suspicious
ones
is
it
acting
he
asked
himself
and
he
gnawed
at
his
lip
why
because
he
is
a
duke
if
he
were
old
and
ugly
and
and
twisted
as
i
am
he
would
still
be
run
after
by
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
and
women
he
added
but
in
a
lower
voice
as
if
he
were
half
ashamed
of
his
cynicism
leslie
understood
and
her
face
flushed
for
a
moment
but
it
was
not
with
guilt
but
the
indignation
of
a
girl
you
mean
that
they
women
would
pretend
to
like
him
because
of
his
rank
she
said
quietly
but
with
gentle
gravity
that
what
i
meant
he
assented
eyeing
her
attentively
there
is
a
woman
in
the
world
whose
heart
does
leap
at
the
thought
of
becoming
a
duchess
it
is
not
true
she
said
her
eyes
flashing
down
at
him
with
purest
indignation
it
is
but
you
are
only
speaking
in
jest
temple
and
she
smiled
at
the
warmth
she
had
been
hurried
into
he
looked
hard
at
her
i
am
not
jesting
he
said
but
stating
the
solemn
shameful
fact
she
gazed
down
at
him
almost
pityingly
ah
you
do
not
know
women
at
all
she
said
no
with
a
shake
of
her
head
as
he
opened
his
lips
you
may
know
a
great
many
and
they
may
be
very
great
ladies
and
a
few
of
them
may
be
as
worldly
as
you
say
they
are
but
not
many
i
will
not
believe
that
he
fingered
his
chin
with
restless
fingers
and
looked
from
right
to
left
if
she
is
not
acting
then
then
she
is
on
the
brink
of
a
great
misery
he
thought
if
i
could
only
believe
her
you
mean
that
it
would
make
no
difference
to
you
whether
a
man
were
a
duke
or
not
he
said
her
face
went
rather
pale
yes
it
would
make
a
difference
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
would
rather
not
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
duke
or
any
one
so
far
above
me
in
rank
and
there
are
thousands
of
women
who
feel
the
same
oh
he
says
curtly
i
never
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
any
seeing
that
that
is
your
feeling
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
honor
me
i
mean
my
cousin
he
corrected
himself
sharply
with
your
friendship
miss
leslie
and
he
smiled
leslie
cheek
burned
and
she
turned
her
face
from
his
keen
eyes
an
actress
he
muttered
and
yet
i
give
her
a
word
of
warning
though
she
does
deserve
it
did
the
duke
happen
to
say
when
he
was
coming
back
miss
leslie
no
she
said
he
said
that
he
might
be
two
or
three
days
he
laughed
i
should
be
surprised
if
portmaris
never
saw
him
again
he
saw
leslie
start
slightly
then
a
faint
smile
flashed
over
her
face
a
smile
of
perfect
faith
yorke
not
come
back
she
remembered
his
last
word
to
her
i
shall
count
every
moment
while
i
away
from
you
dearest
every
moment
till
i
am
back
with
you
my
cousin
is
rather
erratic
said
the
duke
casually
and
indifferently
he
is
a
very
nice
fellow
and
the
rest
of
it
but
well
a
little
fickle
at
least
that
the
character
the
ladies
give
him
fickle
she
said
smiling
still
he
said
languidly
what
that
song
in
grand
duchess
butterfly
flits
from
flower
to
flower
one
must
blame
the
butterfly
you
know
its
nature
to
as
watts
says
and
like
the
butterfly
yorke
is
what
is
called
very
susceptible
he
is
always
falling
in
love
she
moved
slightly
and
the
smile
died
away
from
her
lips
but
the
clear
eyes
met
his
steadily
unflinchingly
and
fortunately
falling
out
of
it
again
he
like
the
man
in
the
play
who
was
in
the
habit
of
proposing
to
some
woman
every
day
and
if
she
accepted
him
he
rode
off
and
she
saw
him
no
more
and
if
she
refused
him
he
asked
her
to
be
a
sister
an
aunt
or
something
of
that
kind
and
rode
off
just
as
easily
she
opened
her
lips
slowly
i
thought
you
were
a
friend
of
the
duke
of
rothbury
mr
temple
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
the
duke
flushed
eh
oh
i
see
you
think
it
very
base
of
me
to
speak
ill
of
him
behind
his
back
that
what
i
meant
she
assented
gravely
oh
but
the
world
would
consider
that
i
had
spoken
at
all
ill
of
him
the
world
she
said
how
wicked
and
heartless
it
must
be
this
world
of
yours
mr
temple
it
is
he
said
curtly
as
heartless
as
a
flint
or
as
the
duke
of
rothbury
if
he
were
what
you
have
painted
him
she
said
very
softly
you
do
believe
me
then
he
asked
looking
up
at
her
from
under
his
thick
brows
she
shook
her
head
not
the
very
least
she
said
actually
smiling
you
forget
that
i
have
known
him
all
his
life
and
that
you
have
only
known
him
five
minutes
she
still
smiled
but
in
five
minutes
one
may
know
she
stopped
and
her
face
flushed
and
the
tears
arose
to
her
eyes
no
i
do
believe
it
she
said
her
voice
tremulous
there
may
be
some
men
who
are
as
false
and
heartless
as
you
say
but
not
the
duke
of
rothbury
he
looked
at
her
gravely
almost
pityingly
do
be
too
sure
of
that
miss
leslie
he
said
with
a
touch
of
warning
in
his
tone
he
is
a
good
fellow
a
charming
companion
but
he
was
stopped
by
the
expression
of
pain
which
shone
in
her
eyes
oh
please
let
us
talk
of
something
else
she
said
quickly
see
here
is
the
postman
i
hope
he
has
brought
my
medicine
said
the
duke
but
the
postman
tugging
at
his
cap
handed
a
small
parcel
to
leslie
for
me
she
said
with
surprise
why
what
can
it
be
are
you
sure
it
is
for
me
and
not
papa
it
is
like
one
of
the
boxes
they
send
the
colors
in
a
sample
of
a
new
scent
or
pearl
powder
said
the
duke
leaning
back
languidly
why
should
they
send
it
to
me
she
said
laughingly
she
tore
off
the
outer
paper
as
she
spoke
and
with
the
pleasant
excitement
which
is
always
produced
by
the
receipt
of
a
parcel
whose
contents
are
unknown
she
opened
the
little
wooden
box
the
duke
heard
an
exclamation
a
cry
of
amazement
of
admiration
of
delight
and
looked
up
sharply
is
it
scent
or
pearl
powder
he
asked
with
an
amused
smile
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
scarcely
heard
him
her
eyes
were
shining
her
lips
apart
it
is
neither
she
said
and
without
another
word
with
the
little
box
fast
clasped
in
her
hand
ran
toward
the
house
chapter
xviii
strange
talk
she
ran
up
the
street
and
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
her
heart
beating
fast
locking
the
door
first
she
opened
the
little
wooden
box
and
took
out
the
pendant
a
glimpse
of
which
she
had
caught
as
she
stood
beside
the
duke
but
though
the
glitter
of
the
diamonds
pleased
her
as
it
will
every
woman
the
few
words
in
his
handwriting
were
more
precious
to
her
than
the
costly
gems
can
any
one
ever
tell
what
her
first
love
letter
means
to
a
young
girl
who
is
in
love
with
the
writer
leslie
gazed
at
one
line
in
yorke
awful
scrawl
as
a
moslem
might
regard
a
verse
from
the
koran
and
not
once
or
twice
only
did
her
sweet
lips
kiss
the
scrap
of
paper
then
she
examined
the
pendant
more
minutely
and
though
her
experience
of
jewelry
was
of
a
very
limited
character
she
knew
that
the
gift
was
an
expensive
one
it
is
too
good
too
grand
for
me
she
said
and
yet
with
a
sensation
of
pleasure
in
its
worth
i
should
have
been
as
pleased
if
he
had
sent
me
a
bunch
of
flowers
bought
in
the
london
streets
but
oh
how
good
of
him
and
after
all
it
is
not
too
grand
for
his
wife
he
would
think
nothing
too
rare
too
costly
for
her
oh
my
love
my
love
if
i
were
only
more
worthy
of
you
she
found
a
piece
of
ribbon
and
put
the
pendant
on
it
and
hung
it
around
her
white
throat
and
the
fire
and
glitter
of
the
diamonds
almost
startled
her
it
is
just
as
well
that
i
may
not
wear
it
openly
yet
she
said
to
herself
with
a
soft
shy
laugh
i
should
feel
as
if
every
one
was
staring
at
me
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
ever
get
used
to
wearing
beautiful
things
like
this
he
would
say
but
i
feel
now
as
if
i
never
should
be
able
to
do
so
without
being
conscious
of
my
splendor
but
i
must
hide
you
for
the
present
you
beautiful
thing
and
she
arranged
the
pendant
so
that
it
nestled
over
her
heart
and
buttoned
her
dress
over
it
and
there
it
seemed
to
glow
with
a
soft
consuming
fire
as
if
it
knew
that
it
had
come
from
the
hand
of
the
man
she
loved
several
times
during
the
day
she
stole
up
to
her
room
and
drew
the
pendant
from
its
and
looked
at
it
with
glistening
eyes
and
if
francis
lisle
had
not
been
blind
to
everything
but
his
awful
pictures
he
could
not
but
have
been
startled
by
the
expression
on
her
face
after
one
of
these
visits
but
if
her
father
was
blind
the
children
were
not
and
as
they
clustered
around
her
they
looked
up
at
her
frank
wonder
in
their
orbs
and
one
mite
lisped
what
makth
sthmile
so
mith
lethlie
have
been
a
dood
girl
and
got
a
penny
diven
yes
i
got
a
penny
given
to
me
trottie
said
leslie
taking
the
child
up
in
her
lap
and
kissing
it
such
a
beautiful
shining
penny
thow
it
me
said
the
little
one
but
leslie
put
her
hand
on
her
bosom
with
a
jealous
smile
no
no
i
ca
show
it
even
to
you
trottie
she
said
not
to
any
one
and
i
am
not
going
to
buy
anything
with
it
but
going
to
keep
it
as
long
as
ever
i
live
she
did
not
see
temple
again
that
day
and
did
not
even
think
of
him
or
the
hard
unjust
things
he
had
said
of
yorke
and
if
she
had
it
would
only
have
been
to
laugh
at
them
yorke
fickle
and
false
with
that
gift
of
his
rising
and
falling
on
her
heart
she
would
not
have
believed
an
angel
if
he
had
come
to
tell
her
anything
against
her
beloved
the
duke
missed
her
all
that
afternoon
missed
her
very
much
he
had
got
used
to
having
her
standing
or
sitting
by
his
chair
and
her
sweet
voice
had
been
as
a
soothing
balm
in
his
moments
of
pain
and
yet
he
could
not
wholly
trust
her
or
believe
that
she
was
better
and
less
mercenary
and
than
the
rest
of
her
sex
his
keen
eyes
had
seen
the
change
in
her
face
when
he
had
spoken
of
yorke
and
he
had
told
himself
that
what
he
had
prophesied
was
coming
true
this
girl
with
the
clear
guileless
eyes
was
already
aiming
at
a
ducal
coronet
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
she
might
love
yorke
for
himself
alone
or
if
it
did
he
put
the
thought
away
from
him
and
hugged
his
old
cynical
mistrust
of
her
sex
the
next
day
passed
and
no
yorke
appeared
but
on
the
morning
of
the
following
one
he
got
into
the
train
at
paddington
on
his
way
to
portmaris
as
he
did
so
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
expectant
happiness
he
noticed
a
tall
lady
dressed
in
black
with
a
veil
over
her
face
pass
his
carriage
and
enter
the
next
and
he
was
struck
in
an
absent
kind
of
way
by
the
grace
of
her
figure
but
she
disappeared
from
his
mind
the
moment
she
passed
the
window
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
picturing
his
meeting
with
leslie
a
few
hours
and
then
he
lit
a
cigar
and
stretched
his
long
legs
on
to
the
opposite
seat
and
thought
the
few
days
he
had
been
absent
from
her
had
taught
this
young
man
how
very
completely
he
was
in
love
and
he
was
actually
asking
himself
why
they
should
not
be
married
at
once
what
the
use
of
waiting
he
mused
i
shall
never
be
better
off
we
might
just
as
well
be
married
now
then
a
reflection
cut
across
his
roseate
visions
and
as
hamlet
says
him
pause
he
was
fearfully
in
debt
and
though
levison
had
turned
up
with
the
bill
and
seemed
more
inclined
to
lend
him
more
money
than
take
any
from
him
he
yorke
knew
the
reason
the
money
lenders
all
depended
upon
his
marrying
an
heiress
and
he
knew
and
his
face
flushed
as
he
thought
of
it
that
they
one
and
all
expected
him
to
marry
lady
eleanor
dallas
and
relied
upon
it
the
moment
they
heard
that
he
had
married
what
they
and
the
rest
of
the
world
in
its
language
of
contempt
would
call
a
pauper
they
would
swoop
down
upon
him
like
a
flock
of
kites
and
he
sat
up
in
the
railway
carriage
and
rubbed
his
forehead
could
he
ask
dolph
to
lend
give
him
the
money
to
pay
his
debts
well
he
could
ask
him
and
no
doubt
the
duke
would
do
it
if
he
approved
of
yorke
marrying
leslie
but
would
he
approve
somehow
yorke
felt
doubtful
i
might
try
him
he
thought
and
he
pondered
over
it
until
the
train
reached
northcliffe
and
then
suddenly
an
alternative
course
occurred
to
him
an
idea
which
flashed
upon
him
suddenly
and
sent
the
blood
rushing
to
his
face
why
should
he
and
leslie
be
married
secretly
they
might
go
away
leave
england
and
settle
down
in
some
continental
place
quietly
until
he
had
screwed
enough
money
out
of
his
income
to
pay
his
debts
and
then
they
might
proclaim
their
marriage
to
the
whole
world
his
heart
beat
hopefully
and
he
was
so
absorbed
in
his
plans
and
schemes
that
he
did
not
notice
that
the
tall
lady
in
black
got
out
at
northcliffe
indeed
he
could
not
have
seen
her
unless
he
had
looked
back
which
he
did
not
do
for
she
did
not
get
out
until
the
rest
of
the
passengers
had
alighted
and
then
kept
in
the
background
until
the
station
was
clear
yorke
got
a
fly
at
once
and
had
himself
driven
to
portmaris
and
as
the
ancient
vehicle
rattled
down
the
street
he
looked
eagerly
at
the
windows
of
sea
view
but
leslie
was
out
and
with
a
little
pang
of
disappointment
yorke
ran
up
the
stairs
of
marine
villa
the
duke
was
sitting
in
his
chair
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
and
yorke
saw
at
once
that
it
was
a
afternoon
with
the
invalid
the
duke
raised
his
head
with
a
transient
smile
of
welcome
on
his
pale
face
well
yorke
back
again
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
telling
grey
to
pack
up
yorke
started
what
tired
of
portmaris
already
dolph
he
said
the
duke
sighed
about
five
minutes
is
long
enough
for
me
anywhere
there
is
only
one
place
i
shall
not
get
weary
of
the
grave
but
this
is
a
very
cheerful
greeting
yorke
what
the
news
oh
nothing
i
saw
lang
this
was
the
duke
agent
and
told
him
what
you
wanted
done
and
oh
thanks
said
the
duke
indifferently
and
you
have
had
a
pleasant
time
i
hope
did
you
see
eleanor
yorke
nodded
yes
oh
yes
had
luncheon
there
she
very
well
what
a
lovely
sunset
my
word
this
is
a
jolly
little
place
jolly
is
it
said
the
duke
eyeing
him
keenly
hem
well
perhaps
it
jollier
when
you
are
here
it
been
dull
enough
without
you
any
way
as
i
said
we
have
missed
you
very
much
young
man
meaning
you
and
grey
said
yorke
standing
at
the
window
and
watching
the
opposite
ones
anxiously
the
duke
smiled
grimly
well
i
dare
say
grey
has
missed
you
but
i
was
thinking
when
i
spoke
of
miss
lisle
oh
miss
lisle
said
yorke
flushing
like
a
schoolgirl
i
i
hope
she
is
all
right
yes
i
think
so
the
fact
is
i
have
not
seen
very
much
of
her
since
yesterday
morning
when
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
ventured
to
hint
that
your
grace
yorke
started
your
grace
was
not
quite
perfect
yorke
laughed
uneasily
and
kept
his
back
carefully
turned
to
the
duke
she
seemed
to
think
that
you
were
more
divine
than
human
and
put
out
her
claws
in
your
defense
like
a
woman
and
a
cat
a
spasm
of
pain
shot
through
him
and
he
groaned
faintly
and
so
though
all
yorke
soul
arose
in
horror
at
hearing
his
beloved
likened
to
a
cat
he
held
his
tongue
in
short
continued
the
duke
wearily
i
was
quite
correct
in
my
surmise
as
to
what
would
take
place
the
girl
is
dying
to
marry
your
grace
and
become
a
duchess
yorke
bit
his
lip
it
time
that
bit
of
nonsense
came
to
an
end
he
said
with
angry
impatience
i
did
like
it
from
the
first
dolph
and
i
like
it
now
less
than
ever
the
duke
waved
his
hand
with
tired
indifference
it
was
an
idiotic
idea
he
said
but
it
has
served
my
purpose
i
have
been
left
alone
here
and
the
rest
and
quiet
have
done
me
good
you
can
tell
the
lisles
and
whom
else
you
like
at
once
if
you
choose
stay
he
said
wait
till
evening
i
shall
have
gone
by
that
time
gone
said
yorke
you
mean
going
yes
said
the
duke
impatiently
i
am
tired
of
it
i
go
and
hide
myself
at
rothbury
i
think
and
i
think
you
had
better
go
too
why
asked
yorke
but
his
voice
faltered
slightly
well
responded
the
duke
grimly
i
an
idea
do
trouble
to
contradict
me
it
is
worth
while
that
miss
leslie
has
succeeded
in
making
an
impression
on
your
grace
and
that
would
be
such
an
awful
calamity
would
it
said
yorke
feeling
his
way
the
duke
laughed
cynically
no
i
suppose
not
you
would
ride
away
like
the
man
in
the
ballad
and
leave
her
weeping
not
that
the
youngest
and
most
unsophisticated
girls
weep
much
now
i
believe
they
dry
their
tears
and
look
out
for
the
next
man
dolph
for
a
man
who
loves
and
respects
women
and
i
know
you
do
oh
do
you
snarled
the
duke
or
rather
the
demon
of
pain
that
had
got
possession
of
him
yes
said
yorke
for
one
who
loves
and
respects
them
you
talk
strangely
well
well
we
do
want
to
squabble
about
women
in
general
or
this
young
woman
in
particular
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
though
usually
i
think
they
are
well
punished
for
their
mercenary
scheming
i
a
sneaking
fondness
and
pity
for
leslie
lisle
and
i
do
want
you
to
let
her
think
that
she
has
a
chance
of
being
a
duchess
in
short
well
of
course
you
have
been
flirting
with
her
you
always
do
you
know
well
leave
her
alone
and
go
back
to
london
he
sighed
that
good
advice
we
let
her
off
this
time
yorke
stood
motionless
with
stern
face
if
i
were
the
duke
i
have
been
masquerading
as
he
said
i
could
not
find
a
better
woman
or
one
more
fitted
by
nature
to
adorn
etc
i
know
interrupted
the
duke
with
peevish
irritation
but
unfortunately
you
are
the
duke
i
wish
to
heaven
you
were
or
anybody
were
but
i
and
as
you
are
not
and
only
yorke
auchester
with
not
enough
to
keep
yourself
upon
to
say
nothing
of
a
wife
you
ca
afford
to
do
more
than
flirt
with
her
there
the
subject
is
played
out
you
have
got
to
marry
eleanor
dallas
my
dear
fellow
she
is
made
for
you
and
you
will
be
as
happy
as
a
man
ever
can
be
in
this
beastliest
of
all
beastly
worlds
you
dispose
of
me
very
easily
said
yorke
his
throat
dry
his
eyes
flashing
but
his
back
still
turned
yes
because
i
care
for
you
and
am
anxious
for
your
future
and
happiness
thanks
said
yorke
in
a
softer
voice
but
well
we
are
arguing
suppose
i
do
not
care
for
eleanor
the
duke
laughed
quietly
my
dear
yorke
no
man
could
be
loved
by
such
a
beautiful
creature
as
eleanor
and
marrying
her
help
falling
in
love
with
her
within
the
first
fortnight
oh
how
tired
i
am
do
let
us
spoil
the
pleasure
i
get
out
of
your
return
by
wrangling
do
as
i
say
leave
this
little
girl
with
the
gray
eyes
and
dark
hair
what
eyes
they
are
by
the
way
and
he
sighed
leave
her
alone
you
ca
marry
her
and
though
you
could
punish
her
for
wanting
to
marry
you
by
flirting
with
her
well
i
do
somehow
want
to
see
her
punished
seriously
yorke
i
ask
you
to
do
this
as
as
a
favor
yorke
left
the
window
you
release
me
from
my
promise
from
our
arrangement
regarding
the
title
he
said
quietly
and
with
a
tone
of
decision
in
his
voice
which
the
duke
would
have
remarked
if
he
had
not
been
in
such
intense
pain
not
till
he
said
i
tell
grey
we
are
going
and
then
just
before
we
go
you
can
tell
the
lisles
explain
the
reason
anything
i
care
nothing
i
shall
be
out
of
reach
of
the
fuss
the
story
will
make
even
in
this
outlandish
place
good
said
yorke
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
going
out
for
a
stroll
dinner
as
usual
i
suppose
and
the
duke
heard
him
going
down
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
the
duke
few
decided
querulous
words
had
fired
yorke
he
was
to
marry
lady
eleanor
was
he
he
laughed
almost
grimly
there
was
only
one
woman
in
the
world
he
would
marry
and
if
she
would
have
him
he
would
make
her
his
wife
at
once
he
strode
down
the
street
and
on
to
the
quay
and
at
a
little
distance
on
the
beach
saw
lisle
painting
as
usual
he
looked
up
impatiently
as
yorke
came
crashing
over
the
stones
and
accosted
him
oh
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
your
grace
he
said
in
his
thin
voice
and
with
a
hasty
glance
at
him
as
if
he
begrudged
every
moment
from
his
picture
is
is
miss
lisle
out
with
you
said
yorke
trying
to
speak
with
nothing
warmer
in
his
voice
than
conventional
politeness
leslie
looking
around
absently
yes
she
was
here
a
moment
ago
but
she
has
wandered
off
somewhere
and
his
manner
and
tone
plainly
added
and
i
wish
to
goodness
you
wander
off
too
how
is
the
picture
getting
on
asked
yorke
looking
at
the
daub
which
lisle
had
painted
over
and
over
again
making
it
worse
at
each
stroke
very
well
very
well
i
think
was
the
reply
you
like
it
and
a
faint
red
came
into
the
pale
thin
cheeks
somehow
yorke
fancied
that
they
had
grown
thinner
and
paler
during
the
last
few
days
i
am
going
to
make
a
masterpiece
of
it
i
am
working
hard
very
hard
is
it
very
hot
and
close
this
morning
i
have
a
stupid
headache
yes
would
you
mind
standing
out
of
the
light
thank
you
yorke
left
him
he
knew
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
ask
the
dreamer
in
which
direction
leslie
had
gone
poor
old
fellow
he
thought
we
take
him
with
us
and
look
after
him
together
give
him
his
painting
tools
and
he
be
happy
enough
he
walked
along
the
beach
and
on
to
the
cliffs
and
suddenly
he
came
upon
leslie
she
was
sitting
in
a
cleft
of
the
rocks
a
book
on
her
lap
but
it
was
lying
face
downward
and
she
was
looking
out
to
sea
he
stole
behind
her
and
bent
down
and
kissed
her
she
started
but
not
violently
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
yorke
was
all
she
said
but
all
her
love
her
joy
on
his
return
breathed
in
the
single
word
he
took
both
her
hands
and
sat
down
beside
her
i
startled
you
dearest
he
said
how
lovely
she
looked
how
sweet
and
ah
how
pure
and
good
not
eleanor
herself
could
look
more
refined
more
than
this
love
of
his
his
leslie
no
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
and
a
little
shyness
in
her
voice
and
eyes
i
ought
to
have
been
startled
but
i
was
not
perhaps
it
was
because
i
was
thinking
of
you
when
did
you
come
back
a
few
minutes
ago
dearest
he
said
has
it
seemed
long
to
you
i
thought
perhaps
that
you
would
have
forgotten
me
she
smiled
at
him
well
i
might
have
done
so
she
said
with
delicious
archness
but
you
provided
against
that
did
you
not
he
did
not
understand
for
a
moment
then
he
laughed
you
got
it
all
right
ah
yes
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
of
gratitude
and
content
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
me
when
it
came
i
was
standing
beside
temple
when
the
postman
brought
it
and
i
cried
out
well
like
a
schoolgirl
he
looked
at
her
wrapt
in
delight
at
her
delight
it
was
a
happy
thought
of
mine
then
he
said
yes
but
why
did
you
send
me
so
grand
a
present
she
said
in
a
low
voice
anything
would
have
done
but
that
she
laughed
and
colored
it
was
too
rich
too
costly
for
such
a
simple
person
as
i
am
he
laughed
so
she
thought
the
plain
little
locket
rich
and
costly
what
would
she
have
considered
the
diamond
pendant
he
had
sent
to
finetta
god
bless
my
darling
my
modest
pearl
he
thought
and
you
were
pleased
with
it
he
said
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
like
it
for
a
minute
or
two
i
feared
that
you
might
consider
me
conceited
in
sending
it
that
a
ring
she
shook
her
head
it
is
beautiful
beautiful
she
said
its
only
fault
is
that
it
is
too
good
too
costly
the
merest
trifle
would
have
served
to
tell
me
that
you
had
not
forgotten
me
and
indeed
i
did
not
need
anything
you
trusted
me
so
completely
dearest
he
said
yes
she
said
simply
with
a
faint
wonder
in
her
voice
at
the
earnestness
in
his
you
trusted
me
he
said
as
earnestly
as
before
and
how
if
i
were
to
ask
you
to
trust
me
still
to
trust
me
in
a
greater
degree
leslie
she
looked
at
him
still
smiling
what
is
it
she
asked
and
the
question
was
a
good
reply
to
his
it
is
just
this
he
said
taking
her
hand
in
both
his
and
holding
it
tightly
see
dearest
i
hesitate
to
tell
you
it
is
so
much
to
ask
you
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
can
not
give
you
the
reason
her
face
paled
but
she
looked
at
him
bravely
are
are
you
going
to
leave
me
again
if
you
must
go
the
love
in
her
voice
in
her
eyes
made
his
heart
actually
ache
leave
you
he
said
well
yes
but
it
will
be
only
for
a
few
hours
a
day
if
if
you
consent
to
do
what
i
am
going
to
ask
you
what
is
it
she
asked
still
calmly
i
want
you
to
marry
me
at
once
leslie
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
almost
solemnly
she
started
and
her
hand
quivered
in
his
marry
you
at
once
she
whispered
her
bosom
heaving
her
long
dark
lashes
trembling
you
are
frightened
dearest
he
said
drawing
her
nearer
to
him
she
was
silent
a
moment
no
she
replied
in
a
whisper
not
frightened
i
think
but
and
that
is
all
he
said
almost
desperately
i
want
our
marriage
to
be
a
secret
one
she
started
now
and
drew
her
hand
from
his
turning
her
pale
face
to
him
with
almost
pained
surprise
listen
leslie
he
said
getting
her
hand
back
again
there
are
reasons
why
it
is
necessary
do
you
understand
my
darling
necessary
that
no
one
should
know
of
our
engagement
the
other
day
when
when
i
told
you
i
loved
you
and
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
i
did
not
think
of
those
reasons
i
did
think
of
anything
but
you
but
they
came
home
to
me
when
i
was
in
london
it
sounds
strange
almost
incredible
no
not
incredible
she
murmured
you
would
believe
anything
i
told
you
you
mean
he
asked
with
bated
breath
her
clear
eyes
met
his
with
her
assent
in
them
as
plainly
as
if
she
had
spoken
my
darling
and
i
can
not
tell
you
but
leslie
in
a
word
i
am
not
free
i
mean
that
i
am
not
my
own
master
a
faint
smile
chased
the
slightly
troubled
look
from
her
face
it
sounds
so
strangely
she
said
a
duke
and
not
your
own
master
he
reddened
and
his
eyes
dropped
before
hers
heaven
and
earth
broke
from
him
almost
passionately
leslie
i
beg
of
you
not
to
to
call
me
that
again
not
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
yes
yes
i
do
beg
of
you
dearest
not
we
will
say
for
another
day
after
that
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
brushed
the
hair
from
his
forehead
impatiently
i
will
explain
then
why
i
ask
you
dearest
i
will
explain
everything
do
do
be
frightened
dearest
think
there
is
any
real
mystery
you
will
yes
you
will
laugh
when
you
hear
what
it
is
shall
i
she
says
trustfully
i
am
not
frightened
i
am
not
even
i
think
very
curious
oh
my
darling
and
you
do
not
even
ask
me
why
this
secrecy
this
concealment
is
necessary
no
she
says
after
a
pause
and
placing
her
other
hand
in
his
if
you
say
so
i
am
content
i
suppose
she
averts
her
face
a
little
i
suppose
you
do
not
wish
your
people
to
know
that
you
are
going
to
marry
one
so
far
beneath
you
one
so
unfit
to
be
a
duchess
he
stifles
a
groan
it
is
not
that
he
says
but
for
his
promise
to
the
duke
he
could
tell
her
all
tell
her
that
he
is
not
a
duke
with
lands
and
gold
galore
but
a
poor
man
so
incumbered
and
crippled
by
debt
that
he
dare
not
let
it
be
known
that
he
is
not
going
to
marry
a
fortune
leslie
i
can
not
tell
you
i
am
not
free
to
tell
you
till
yes
will
you
not
trust
me
her
breath
comes
fast
for
a
moment
as
she
looks
out
to
sea
then
she
turns
to
him
i
can
not
but
trust
you
she
says
almost
piteously
i
could
not
doubt
you
if
i
tried
my
angel
my
dearest
he
says
fervently
reverently
you
shall
never
regret
having
trusted
me
never
now
listen
leslie
there
is
one
person
of
all
others
who
must
not
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
mr
temple
mr
temple
she
says
not
suspiciously
not
even
curiously
but
with
faint
surprise
yes
he
says
he
suspects
or
already
that
i
love
you
it
must
be
kept
from
him
you
will
understand
why
when
i
tell
you
all
when
i
clear
up
the
mystery
now
see
he
stops
and
laughs
his
face
is
flushed
with
excitement
and
his
eyes
sparkling
i
will
go
up
to
town
she
breathes
yes
he
says
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
you
will
see
that
when
you
know
all
i
will
get
a
special
license
and
that
same
day
you
must
come
up
to
london
she
trembles
alone
she
asks
in
a
still
voice
no
no
he
says
you
must
persuade
your
father
stay
i
will
manage
that
i
will
get
a
dealer
i
know
to
wire
to
him
some
question
about
his
pictures
something
that
will
bring
him
up
she
trembled
still
the
moment
you
arrive
you
must
telegraph
your
address
to
me
i
will
tell
you
where
to
wire
he
takes
out
an
old
envelope
and
writes
lord
auchester
then
with
an
exclamation
tears
it
up
and
on
another
piece
of
paper
writes
yorke
dorchester
club
pall
mall
mind
dearest
send
the
telegram
at
once
and
at
once
i
will
come
to
you
and
the
rest
you
must
leave
to
me
you
will
i
will
she
says
almost
inaudibly
and
as
solemnly
as
ever
marriage
vow
was
whispered
her
great
love
and
trust
overwhelm
him
and
something
like
tears
yes
tears
dim
his
bright
eyes
my
darling
if
i
ever
forget
your
love
and
trust
your
goodness
to
me
may
heaven
forget
me
he
says
in
a
voice
that
makes
her
thrill
i
will
make
you
happy
leslie
happier
than
any
woman
ever
was
before
every
hour
of
my
life
his
voice
breaks
oh
my
darling
what
have
i
done
that
heaven
should
send
me
such
an
angel
the
tears
are
in
her
eyes
now
i
made
you
cry
he
says
ah
i
know
you
are
thinking
of
your
father
leslie
she
starts
guiltily
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
life
devoted
to
him
she
has
forgotten
her
father
do
not
fret
about
him
he
shall
go
with
us
he
shall
belong
as
much
to
me
as
to
you
what
do
you
think
i
would
separate
you
they
sit
hand
in
hand
for
how
long
at
last
he
tears
himself
away
remember
dearest
are
his
last
words
send
to
me
directly
the
moment
you
reach
london
and
leslie
fear
nothing
why
when
one
thinks
of
it
and
he
laughs
what
is
there
to
fear
he
is
gone
at
last
she
stands
and
watches
him
as
he
makes
his
way
with
many
a
backward
glance
along
the
quay
then
she
sinks
on
to
the
rock
again
her
heart
is
throbbing
a
mist
is
floating
before
her
eyes
she
can
not
think
can
not
see
so
unconscious
of
everything
around
her
is
she
that
when
half
an
hour
later
the
dark
graceful
figure
of
a
woman
passes
near
her
nook
she
does
not
heed
or
notice
it
she
is
in
love
land
and
rapt
in
love
dream
chapter
xix
finetta
way
after
a
time
leslie
got
up
but
she
wanted
to
be
alone
a
little
longer
she
felt
that
she
could
not
talk
even
to
her
father
just
then
she
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
over
all
yorke
had
told
her
she
walked
a
few
yards
toward
the
quay
and
saw
that
lisle
was
still
painting
then
she
turned
and
slowly
paced
in
the
direction
of
ragged
point
which
stretched
out
dark
and
sullen
in
the
sunlight
as
she
had
said
not
a
doubt
of
yorke
truth
and
honor
cast
a
shadow
over
her
happiness
if
he
said
that
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
married
at
once
and
secretly
it
must
be
so
it
should
be
so
he
was
her
lover
her
master
her
king
she
had
given
herself
to
him
absolutely
she
trusted
him
because
she
could
not
help
herself
she
had
almost
reached
the
point
and
would
have
gone
on
but
she
remembered
that
the
tide
was
coming
in
and
that
there
would
not
be
time
to
get
round
before
the
sea
rose
above
the
narrow
ledge
of
rock
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
and
she
was
turning
back
when
she
caught
sight
of
something
dark
above
a
rock
at
the
very
foot
of
the
point
for
a
moment
she
thought
it
was
a
bird
then
she
saw
that
it
was
a
hat
a
woman
hat
someone
was
sitting
there
in
an
instant
it
struck
her
that
it
might
be
a
stranger
unacquainted
with
the
conformation
of
the
coast
line
and
that
if
she
sat
there
for
a
few
minutes
longer
she
would
be
unable
to
get
back
or
to
turn
the
point
leslie
looked
at
the
tide
and
was
startled
to
find
that
it
had
run
up
quicker
than
she
had
thought
there
would
be
barely
time
to
reach
the
woman
behind
the
rock
and
warn
her
she
ran
forward
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
but
the
voice
of
the
incoming
waves
beating
against
the
rocks
drowned
hers
she
looked
round
hoping
to
see
a
boat
or
a
fisherman
but
no
one
was
in
sight
and
she
and
the
unknown
sitting
there
in
all
unconsciousness
of
her
peril
were
alone
in
the
grim
place
most
women
would
have
paused
and
thought
of
her
own
safety
but
leslie
and
selfishness
had
not
yet
made
acquaintance
and
she
hurried
on
running
where
there
was
a
bare
bit
of
sand
and
scrambling
over
the
rocks
that
lay
in
her
path
at
last
she
reached
the
one
behind
which
the
woman
she
had
come
to
warn
was
sitting
and
stood
before
her
breathlessly
oh
quick
quick
she
cried
pantingly
then
she
stopped
and
recoiled
a
little
it
was
a
girl
seated
in
an
attitude
of
weariness
and
lassitude
her
elbows
on
her
knees
her
head
bowed
even
in
this
first
moment
leslie
noted
the
grace
and
sorrowful
abandon
of
the
figure
but
it
was
the
uplifted
face
that
made
her
recoil
for
it
was
that
of
the
woman
she
had
seen
below
martin
tower
it
was
the
woman
who
had
sung
the
disreputable
ditty
there
was
no
reckless
gaiety
in
the
face
now
but
a
misery
and
despair
so
eloquent
that
even
as
she
recoiled
leslie
heart
ached
with
pity
for
her
the
dark
eyes
looked
at
leslie
vacantly
for
a
moment
then
flashed
with
sudden
anger
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
she
asked
half
sullenly
half
defiantly
leslie
flushed
at
the
tone
in
which
the
greeting
was
conveyed
i
i
saw
you
sitting
here
she
said
quickly
and
a
little
tremulously
for
the
dark
face
disquieted
her
and
inspired
her
with
a
vague
uneasiness
i
saw
you
from
the
beach
yonder
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
were
a
stranger
i
am
a
stranger
yes
what
of
it
said
the
woman
as
sullenly
and
suspiciously
as
before
and
you
do
not
know
that
this
is
ragged
point
and
that
the
tide
is
coming
up
fast
very
fast
said
leslie
quickly
is
it
what
does
it
matter
was
the
dull
response
oh
do
you
not
understand
said
leslie
earnestly
when
the
tide
comes
up
here
where
you
are
sitting
you
will
not
be
able
to
go
on
or
turn
back
you
see
how
the
point
stretches
out
the
dark
eyes
looked
wearily
to
right
and
left
i
see
she
said
no
i
did
know
it
i
do
know
how
long
been
sitting
here
she
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
tide
comes
up
here
does
it
yes
yes
said
leslie
hurriedly
pray
come
away
at
once
for
the
girl
had
made
no
attempt
to
get
up
we
have
only
just
time
to
get
round
the
point
even
if
we
run
come
at
once
and
in
her
eagerness
she
held
out
her
hand
to
help
her
to
rise
the
girl
disregarded
the
outstretched
hand
and
rose
wearily
sullenly
i
suppose
i
should
have
been
drowned
if
you
had
not
seen
me
she
remarked
listlessly
oh
i
hope
not
i
hope
not
said
leslie
but
i
am
very
glad
i
did
see
you
i
only
caught
sight
of
the
top
of
your
hat
you
had
better
take
my
hand
i
am
used
to
getting
over
the
rocks
and
stones
i
can
get
on
all
right
said
the
girl
sullenly
refusing
the
proffered
assistance
i
as
young
as
you
are
and
as
strong
she
added
glancing
out
of
the
corners
of
her
dark
eyes
at
leslie
i
am
glad
you
are
strong
said
leslie
gravely
as
she
looked
at
the
swiftly
surely
incoming
sea
for
we
shall
have
to
run
her
companion
stopped
and
looked
seaward
too
and
with
a
strange
expression
oh
why
do
you
wait
demanded
leslie
do
you
not
understand
that
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
the
girl
laughed
a
reckless
miserable
laugh
which
was
a
grotesque
reflection
of
the
laugh
which
leslie
had
heard
on
the
tower
when
she
had
last
seen
her
i
was
thinking
if
it
was
worth
while
she
said
moodily
leslie
stared
at
her
worth
while
she
echoed
unconsciously
yes
i
not
sure
it
would
be
better
and
easier
to
stop
here
and
let
the
water
come
up
it
would
save
a
lot
of
trouble
she
laughed
again
with
a
faint
shudder
leslie
turned
away
from
the
dark
eyes
and
seized
the
speaker
arm
you
must
come
at
once
she
said
firmly
the
woman
drew
back
for
a
moment
then
as
if
yielding
against
her
will
allowed
leslie
to
draw
her
forward
they
hurried
over
the
rocks
in
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
the
waves
splashing
against
their
feet
then
leslie
stopped
and
uttered
an
exclamation
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
cliff
before
them
her
face
suddenly
pale
what
is
the
matter
are
we
too
late
asked
her
companion
dully
and
indifferently
yes
we
are
too
late
replied
leslie
in
a
low
voice
then
she
caught
her
breath
and
forced
a
smile
do
not
be
frightened
we
may
get
round
the
other
way
the
ledge
of
rock
is
wider
there
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
get
over
we
must
go
back
follow
me
she
turned
and
sprang
quickly
from
rock
to
rock
and
her
companion
followed
her
example
they
gained
the
spot
where
the
girl
had
been
sitting
but
it
was
now
covered
by
the
sea
and
they
had
to
wade
ankle
deep
leslie
caught
the
girl
hand
hold
fast
she
said
in
a
quick
whisper
if
we
gain
that
point
there
where
the
rock
sticks
out
even
as
she
spoke
a
spurt
of
foam
covered
the
spot
indicated
and
the
waves
dashed
over
it
she
stopped
and
looked
round
her
her
face
white
and
set
we
are
too
late
here
too
she
said
with
a
smothered
sob
too
late
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
the
other
girl
leant
against
the
cliff
and
stared
dully
at
the
angry
waves
creeping
creeping
like
some
wild
beast
towards
them
you
mean
we
are
going
to
die
she
said
in
a
low
harsh
voice
going
to
die
like
rats
in
a
hole
well
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
care
much
myself
you
see
when
you
came
up
just
now
i
was
wishing
i
was
dead
leslie
shuddered
and
put
up
her
hand
as
if
to
stop
her
death
was
too
near
to
be
spoken
of
so
lightly
yes
i
was
you
shocked
i
dessay
i
sorry
for
you
it
a
pity
you
did
stop
where
you
were
you
not
tired
of
life
judging
by
your
face
tired
of
life
panted
leslie
oh
no
no
so
i
should
say
said
the
other
sullenly
so
you
do
understand
what
i
mean
and
what
i
feel
no
i
do
understand
said
leslie
scarcely
knowing
what
she
was
saying
but
it
is
dreadful
dreadful
to
hear
you
and
at
such
a
moment
hah
she
broke
off
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
and
drew
her
companion
back
close
to
the
face
of
the
cliff
for
a
wave
had
dashed
at
their
feet
and
wet
them
to
the
waist
it
coming
up
pretty
fast
said
the
girl
it
wo
take
long
to
is
there
any
chance
for
you
i
do
care
about
myself
leslie
screened
her
eyes
with
her
hand
a
boat
might
be
passing
she
said
faintly
oh
to
think
that
they
are
so
near
that
there
are
people
just
round
that
bend
who
if
they
knew
only
knew
would
risk
their
lives
to
save
us
and
she
sank
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
i
sorry
said
the
other
it
rough
on
you
to
lose
your
life
for
me
a
stranger
too
leslie
sprang
up
her
eyes
wild
with
despair
we
will
not
die
she
cried
we
will
not
do
you
hear
oh
i
can
not
die
i
can
not
leave
him
like
this
and
she
beat
her
hands
together
you
thinking
of
your
husband
who
asked
the
other
eyeing
her
half
pityingly
it
always
a
man
that
where
i
got
the
pull
of
you
and
she
laughed
my
man
would
care
whether
i
lived
or
died
he
left
me
already
the
anguish
in
her
voice
the
reckless
despair
went
to
leslie
heart
she
shuddered
as
she
looked
at
the
dark
eyes
left
you
she
breathed
oh
now
i
understand
ah
yes
i
know
now
why
you
want
to
die
yes
was
the
bitter
response
that
where
we
women
are
such
fools
we
care
men
do
you
think
your
husband
or
sweetheart
or
whoever
he
is
will
break
his
heart
for
the
loss
of
you
she
laughed
mockingly
not
he
they
do
break
their
hearts
so
easily
he
get
over
it
and
marry
another
woman
almost
before
you
cold
in
your
grave
i
was
going
to
say
leslie
shrank
back
from
her
as
far
as
she
could
and
put
her
hands
up
to
her
ears
oh
hush
hush
she
panted
it
is
not
true
it
is
wicked
and
false
i
will
not
listen
to
you
oh
forgive
me
she
broke
off
her
indignation
and
horror
softened
by
the
misery
on
the
white
face
and
dark
eyes
staring
so
hopelessly
at
the
angry
sea
how
you
must
have
suffered
how
you
must
have
loved
him
to
be
so
wretched
so
indifferent
oh
yes
i
loved
him
i
loved
him
well
as
much
as
you
loved
the
man
you
thinking
of
when
when
did
it
happen
when
did
he
leave
you
why
tell
me
said
leslie
let
us
talk
try
and
forget
that
it
is
coming
nearer
and
nearer
that
we
have
only
a
few
minutes
yes
we
have
long
was
the
response
i
been
watching
that
rock
there
almost
in
a
line
with
us
you
could
see
the
top
a
moment
ago
it
covered
now
when
did
he
leave
me
only
a
few
nights
ago
why
the
old
story
he
got
tired
of
me
i
suppose
anyhow
he
met
someone
else
and
and
you
were
to
have
been
his
wife
breathed
leslie
pityingly
and
you
loved
him
oh
how
could
he
be
so
cruel
so
heartless
the
other
looked
down
at
her
and
laughed
harshly
why
men
are
like
that
all
of
them
no
no
not
all
they
are
not
all
so
base
so
vile
you
think
so
you
wait
perhaps
your
turn
will
come
but
i
forgot
she
laughed
again
your
man
wo
have
the
chance
to
leave
you
there
i
beg
your
pardon
for
leslie
had
shrunk
away
from
her
do
mind
me
or
what
i
say
i
half
out
of
my
mind
i
had
no
sleep
since
since
he
left
me
and
i
come
a
long
journey
and
eaten
nothing
yes
half
mad
i
was
a
fool
to
follow
him
i
ought
to
have
stayed
at
home
but
i
got
my
punishment
you
came
after
him
he
is
here
then
asked
leslie
in
a
pitying
whisper
watching
the
waves
as
she
spoke
yes
said
she
then
with
a
sigh
yes
and
i
seen
him
i
meant
to
speak
to
him
to
to
try
and
get
him
back
but
my
heart
failed
me
and
i
crept
out
here
to
be
alone
it
was
only
to
see
him
that
i
came
i
wanted
to
see
her
her
repeated
leslie
half
absently
yes
the
woman
that
stole
him
from
me
but
it
does
matter
now
nothing
matters
to
us
two
does
it
how
much
longer
the
question
almost
drove
leslie
frantic
with
agony
the
anguish
of
despair
it
was
all
very
well
for
this
poor
creature
abandoned
deserted
by
the
man
she
loved
to
take
death
so
coolly
but
she
leslie
was
not
deserted
and
unhappy
her
lover
her
yorke
was
going
to
make
her
his
wife
in
a
few
days
a
few
hours
he
would
be
waiting
for
her
yorke
yorke
her
heart
called
to
him
and
though
the
name
did
not
leave
her
lips
the
voice
within
her
seemed
to
give
her
courage
to
fill
her
with
a
fierce
almost
savage
determination
to
live
she
looked
up
at
the
cliff
with
straining
eyes
it
was
almost
perpendicular
and
smooth
just
above
them
but
a
little
further
along
there
were
a
few
scrubby
bushes
projecting
from
the
surface
it
was
just
possible
if
they
could
reach
those
that
they
might
at
least
gain
some
few
inches
of
foothold
just
possible
though
the
mere
thought
of
the
attempt
made
her
tremble
what
are
you
staring
up
there
for
asked
her
companion
you
climb
it
if
you
tried
no
panted
leslie
but
we
will
try
the
other
shook
heir
head
but
leslie
seized
her
by
the
hand
come
she
gasped
hoarsely
better
to
try
and
and
fall
than
stand
here
to
wait
for
death
i
can
not
wait
come
hold
my
hand
tightly
we
will
escape
or
die
together
as
if
she
had
caught
something
of
leslie
frantic
desire
of
life
the
other
girl
gripped
leslie
hand
come
on
then
she
said
though
you
have
more
chance
alone
no
no
together
or
not
at
all
cried
leslie
and
she
plunged
into
the
water
for
a
moment
or
two
it
seemed
as
if
they
would
be
carried
off
their
feet
as
if
they
had
rushed
into
the
arms
of
the
death
from
which
they
had
been
shrinking
but
they
were
both
young
and
strong
and
they
accomplished
together
that
which
would
have
been
impossible
if
they
had
been
separate
gasping
for
breath
half
blinded
by
the
spray
deafened
by
the
roar
of
the
waves
they
stood
on
a
narrow
ledge
of
rock
clutching
at
the
bush
above
their
heads
the
water
rushing
nearly
to
their
knees
chapter
xx
i
going
to
live
and
so
are
you
we
shall
hold
on
here
for
about
two
minutes
said
the
woman
grimly
if
the
bush
do
give
way
before
that
leslie
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
shut
her
eyes
and
he
will
be
waiting
for
me
she
murmured
he
will
not
know
will
think
i
have
mistrusted
him
i
shall
never
see
him
again
never
hear
his
voice
oh
why
did
we
part
why
did
i
ask
him
pray
him
to
take
me
with
him
never
to
see
him
again
she
broke
off
with
a
sob
that
shook
her
my
arm
is
numbed
i
am
falling
she
said
with
a
wail
tell
him
tell
him
oh
god
and
i
love
him
so
the
agony
in
her
voice
seemed
to
go
straight
to
her
companion
heart
the
dark
face
flushed
red
her
eyes
shone
with
a
kind
of
pity
hold
on
she
said
almost
hissed
between
her
white
teeth
shut
fast

to
me
i
say
with
one
hand
anyhow
scarcely
knowing
what
she
was
doing
leslie
released
the
bush
with
one
hand
and
put
her
arm
round
her
companion
neck
if
i
only
a
drop
of
brandy
muttered
the
woman
how

arm

now
for
i
going
to
have
a
shy
at

bush
above
a
bit
of
a
path
she
laughed
fiercely
defiantly
old
faber
had
us
do
gymnastics
i
used
to
hate
but
i
much
obliged
to
him
now
put
your
foot
against
the
rock
and
spring
not
too
hard
mind
when
i
do
once
let
me
get
a
grip
of
that
bush
up
there
and
i
hang
on
or
fight
my
way
till
my
arms
drop
off
die
why
should
i
i

a
fool
i
get
him
back
you

if
i
do
no
we
wo

shall
have
your
husband
again
now
she
breathed
between
her
clenched
teeth
if
you
got
any
pluck
in
you
if
you
want
to
see
your
husband
again
put
your
heart
into
it
now
she
made
a
spring
they
both
sprang
at
the
same
moment
as
if
they
were
one
body
inspired
by
the
same
will
and
the
woman
got
hold
of
the
bush
and
clung
with
the
strength
and
tenacity
of
a
leopardess
ah
she
gasped
we
done
it
cling
on
to
me
we
wait
while
i
count
twenty
and
then
we
go
for
the
path
no
no
panted
leslie
i
could
not
i
could
not
let
us
stay
here
till
till
this
bit
of
ledge
crumbles
under
us
with
our
weight
and
lets
us
drop
like
poisoned
flies
no
no
i
do
feel
like
that
it
convenient
to
die
now
it
was
just
now
i
going
to
live
to
live
and
so
are
you
she
counted
the
twenty
then
put
her
arm
around
leslie
waist
now
put
your
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
cling
with
the
other
to
the
bits
of
bush
and
stump
and
do
look
down
mind
that
or
you
drop
as
sure
as
fate
leslie
shuddered
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
but
a
grand
hope
was
creeping
over
her
was
it
possible
that
she
should
live
and
see
yorke
once
more
slowly
she
felt
her
way
along
the
surface
with
her
hand
till
she
got
hold
of
the
dry
but
firmly
rooted
scrub
then
she
drew
herself
up
and
along
the
narrow
ledge
which
was
a
fissure
in
the
rock
rather
than
a
path
no
one
in
cold
blood
could
have
maintained
a
footing
there
for
more
than
thirty
seconds
but
these
two
were
fighting
for
dear
life
and
their
blood
was
burning
at
fever
heat
and
they
managed
almost
miraculously
to
creep
crawl
drag
themselves
upward
and
still
upward
below
them
roared
the
angry
waves
as
if
with
mocking
rage
at
their
attempts
to
escape
their
voracious
maw
above
their
heads
whirled
the
gulls
screaming
weirdly
every
now
and
then
a
stone
displaced
by
their
feet
rolled
and
sprang
from
point
to
point
and
ultimately
bounded
into
the
gulf
below
them
and
each
time
leslie
felt
that
in
a
moment
she
would
be
bounding
and
falling
like
the
stone
to
the
hideous
death
for
some
minutes
neither
spoke
they
could
hear
each
other
breath
coming
in
thick
labored
gasps
and
leslie
who
was
in
front
now
and
again
felt
her
companion
breath
striking
like
that
of
a
hot
furnace
on
her
neck
keep
on
hold
tight
she
heard
her
say
presently
keep
your
eyes
up
the
path
broadening
if
if
we
can
hold
on
another
minute
or
two
or
a
year
for
that
what
it
seems
like
we
saved
leslie
could
not
reply
her
tongue
cleaved
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
her
lips
dry
and
stiff
would
not
move
but
still
as
she
climbed
her
heart
voice
murmured
yorke
yorke
and
she
drew
courage
from
it
it
was
worth
fighting
for
this
life
of
hers
this
life
which
his
love
had
made
so
precious
so
beauteous
if
she
lived
she
would
be
his
wife
his
wife
yes
she
would
live
she
would
fight
on
while
there
was
breath
in
her
body
while
there
was
strength
in
her
fingers
to
clutch
an
inch
of
even
the
moss
on
the
cliff
surface
in
such
moments
time
is
not
it
is
swallowed
up
in
the
agony
the
suspense
the
mingled
hope
and
despair
which
rack
and
wring
the
heart
and
brain
she
scarcely
knew
how
long
they
had
been
making
their
awful
journey
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
scarcely
realized
that
they
were
saved
when
she
saw
the
edge
of
the
cliff
just
above
her
and
with
one
great
effort
raised
herself
above
it
above
it
and
threw
herself
upon
the
level
ground
gripping
the
short
turf
with
her
hot
fingers
as
if
she
dreaded
that
something
would
drag
her
back
again
and
hurl
her
into
the
awful
sea
whose
voice
still
howled
faintly
in
her
ears
she
lay
thus
for
a
minute
or
two
her
companion
lying
at
her
elbow
panting
beside
her
then
with
a
great
sob
leslie
rose
to
her
knees
and
poured
out
her
heart
in
thanksgiving
to
him
who
had
restored
her
to
life
and
to
yorke
the
woman
stood
and
eyed
her
with
a
pale
face
and
half
lowered
lids
where
are
we
she
said
at
last
leslie
rose
and
turned
to
her
with
both
hands
outstretched
oh
what
can
i
say
how
can
i
thank
you
she
exclaimed
in
great
agitation
you
have
saved
my
life
the
woman
wiped
her
lips
and
forced
a
smile
that
a
rum
way
of
putting
it
she
said
her
voice
shaking
a
little
if
i
did
you
saved
mine
first
it
was
a
narrow
squeak
for
both
of
us
she
looked
round
almost
impatiently
where
are
we
she
repeated
i
i
want
to
get
back
to
london
as
soon
as
i
can
i
been
half
out
of
my
mind
i
think
and
this
this
affair
has
pulled
me
round
do
you
take
any
notice
of
what
i
said
about
about
him
the
man
i
spoke
of
i
do
believe
i
lost
him
after
all
i
can
get
him
back
she
laughed
discordantly
and
flushed
as
if
half
ashamed
of
the
new
hope
that
the
escape
from
death
had
seemed
to
give
her
he
he
no
worse
than
the
rest
they
all
alike
easily
taken
with
a
new
face
and
and
i
know
he
likes
me
he
was
sorry
for
going
directly
after
he
left
me
and
yes
she
pushed
the
black
hair
from
her
face
yes
i
bet
my
life
i
get
him
back
leslie
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
yes
she
said
i
hope
so
ah
yes
i
hope
so
it
was
dreadful
to
see
you
and
hear
you
when
we
were
down
there
and
she
glanced
with
a
shudder
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
yes
i
was
pretty
low
then
said
the
other
it
was
a
hard
fight
was
it
you
and
i
ought
to
be
friends
but
she
paused
and
looked
hard
and
almost
shyly
at
leslie
face
but
perhaps
you
would
care
for
that
you
a
lady
a
swell
i
can
see
and
i
well
i
not
fit
leslie
put
out
her
hand
to
stop
her
you
must
not
talk
like
that
now
now
just
when
we
have
escaped
death
together
and
i
hope
ah
yes
i
hope
that
you
will
be
happier
that
he
she
blushed
and
her
voice
grew
low
love
was
so
sacred
a
thing
to
her
that
he
you
love
will
come
back
to
you
if
he
does
you
must
forgive
him
and
take
him
back
she
stopped
for
the
tall
graceful
figure
in
front
of
her
swayed
and
staggered
and
the
dark
eyes
grew
suddenly
heavy
and
closed
leslie
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
oh
what
is
it
you
are
ill
faint
the
other
opened
her
lips
as
if
to
speak
then
fell
heavily
forward
on
leslie
arm
leslie
knelt
beside
her
on
the
grass
and
looked
round
anxiously
the
solitude
was
as
intense
as
that
which
they
had
just
left
they
were
still
alone
together
with
no
help
near
leslie
remembered
that
a
small
spring
ran
from
a
cleft
on
the
cliff
and
though
the
thought
of
going
near
the
edge
made
her
heart
quake
she
gently
set
the
woman
head
down
and
stooping
over
the
cliff
wet
her
handkerchief
in
the
rill
and
returning
bathed
the
white
face
with
one
hand
while
she
unfastened
the
bosom
of
the
lifeless
dress
with
the
other
as
she
did
so
her
hand
came
in
contact
with
something
hard
though
for
a
second
or
two
she
was
too
intent
upon
watching
for
some
signs
of
returning
consciousness
in
the
face
on
her
knee
to
look
to
see
what
it
was
but
presently
her
eye
caught
a
plain
gold
locket
poor
girl
she
thought
it
is
the
gift
of
the
man
who
has
deserted
her
and
she
wears
it
near
her
heart
poor
girl
poor
girl
at
that
moment
the
white
lips
parted
and
the
dark
eyes
opened
yorke
she
breathed
is
it
you
yorke
have
you
come
back
to
me
the
words
struck
upon
leslie
ear
at
first
without
any
significance
she
scarcely
heard
them
or
took
them
in
for
a
space
during
which
one
could
have
counted
fifty
then
gradually
it
came
upon
her
gradually
slowly
yorke
is
it
you
yorke
have
you
come
back
to
me
she
repeated
them
mechanically
as
one
repeats
a
phrase
in
a
foreign
language
the
meaning
of
which
one
does
not
understand
then
she
began
to
tremble
and
a
faint
sick
dread
fell
upon
her
all
the
time
she
bathed
the
white
face
and
lips
and
brushed
the
dark
hair
from
the
low
handsome
forehead
doing
it
mechanically
absently
yorke
had
this
girl
said
yorke
or
was
she
mistaken
she
waited
breathless
the
sick
feeling
weighing
on
her
heart
and
presently
the
full
lips
opened
again
and
again
the
name
the
beloved
name
was
breathed
there
could
be
no
mistake
this
time
leslie
heard
it
plainly
it
was
yorke
her
hand
trembled
the
beautiful
face
on
her
lap
grew
dim
and
seemed
to
fade
away
then
she
made
an
effort
and
forced
the
dread
from
her
heart
and
a
smile
to
her
lips
what
if
this
girl
the
beautiful
girl
had
called
upon
yorke
surely
there
was
more
than
one
man
of
that
name
in
the
world
the
great
big
wide
world
and
this
woman
yorke
was
not
could
not
be
hers
leslie
she
could
have
laughed
at
her
wicked
worse
than
wicked
foolish
fears
could
have
laughed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
stress
of
circumstances
how
could
she
suspect
for
a
moment
that
he
yorke
the
duke
of
rothbury
her
lover
so
good
and
true
and
stanch
should
be
the
yorke
whom
this
woman
loved
and
who
had
by
her
own
account
deserted
her
oh
i
wrong
him
cruelly
wickedly
even
by
this
momentary
doubt
she
told
herself
he
would
not
have
doubted
me
as
i
have
done
him
though
only
for
a
second
and
her
face
flushed
but
though
she
reproached
herself
her
mind
was
at
work
and
against
her
will
she
remembered
how
she
had
first
seen
this
girl
she
recalled
the
scene
the
incident
at
martin
tower
yorke
had
stood
beside
her
looking
down
and
he
had
started
yes
and
turned
pale
white
to
the
lips
as
the
woman
voice
had
floated
up
to
them
did
he
know
her
all
her
being
rose
in
revolt
at
the
idea
the
suspicion
and
yet
she
remembered
his
face
as
it
had
looked
at
that
moment
she
had
thought
that
he
had
turned
pale
with
anger
that
such
a
song
should
have
been
sung
in
her
presence
and
had
loved
him
for
his
anxiety
on
her
account
she
tried
to
thrust
the
dawning
suspicion
from
her
as
if
it
were
some
insidious
demon
whispering
in
her
ear
but
still
she
could
not
forget
that
this
woman
had
told
her
that
she
had
come
down
here
to
portmaris
had
followed
the
man
she
loved
to
this
place
and
yorke
had
come
down
here
had
come
down
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
struck
the
two
figures
the
white
face
lying
on
leslie
lap
adding
a
lustre
to
the
dark
hair
that
swept
across
leslie
dress
how
beautiful
she
looked
leslie
thought
in
a
dull
vague
way
how
beautiful
any
man
might
well
lose
his
heart
to
such
a
woman
even
though
she
were
not
a
lady
and
capable
of
singing
such
a
song
as
she
had
heard
these
lips
sing
any
man
even
no
not
yorke
he
would
not
could
not
have
loved
her
it
was
she
leslie
herself
whom
he
loved
not
this
woman
even
as
she
laid
the
flattering
unction
to
her
soul
her
eye
fell
again
upon
the
locket
it
was
lying
open
face
downward
upon
the
woman
breast
a
desire
an
overwhelming
desire
to
take
it
up
and
see
what
face
was
enshrined
in
it
seized
upon
her
one
glance
and
this
vague
unjust
suspicion
of
hers
would
be
set
at
rest
for
ever
she
knew
knew
that
it
would
not
be
yorke
her
yorke
face
she
should
see
she
fought
against
the
desire
the
craving
love
was
a
sacred
thing
to
her
and
it
would
seem
like
sacrilege
to
touch
this
trinket
which
this
poor
girl
wore
doubtless
the
gift
of
the
man
she
loved
so
dearly
the
man
whose
desertion
had
caused
her
to
weary
of
life
to
desire
death
no
no
i
can
not
i
will
not
leslie
breathed
pantingly
but
even
as
she
spoke
the
words
her
hand
stole
towards
the
locket
upon
which
the
rich
sunlight
was
falling
once
twice
her
hand
approached
it
and
drew
back
but
at
the
third
time
she
took
it
up
raised
it
slowly
and
then
swiftly
turned
it
upwards
then
still
holding
it
her
eyes
riveted
upon
it
with
a
gaze
of
horror
and
agony
she
cried
yorke
it
is
yorke
chapter
xxi
it
is
false
i
will
not
believe
it
it
was
yorke
leslie
gazed
down
at
the
locket
lying
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
for
the
moment
too
benumbed
by
the
sudden
shock
to
feel
anything
yes
it
was
his
face
the
handsome
face
whose
every
line
every
expression
were
engraved
on
her
heart
for
a
second
or
two
the
portrait
as
it
smiled
up
at
her
with
yorke
characteristic
look
in
its
eyes
gave
her
a
kind
of
pleasure
then
she
began
to
realize
where
she
had
found
it
lying
on
the
bosom
of
this
woman
she
dropped
the
locket
as
if
it
had
suddenly
burnt
her
and
shrank
back
as
far
as
she
could
without
displacing
the
woman
head
from
her
knee
yorke
portrait
in
a
locket
in
the
possession
of
another
woman
how
could
it
be
there
must
be
some
mistake
some
hideous
mistake
it
could
not
be
his
face
but
that
of
someone
some
relation
closely
resembling
him
she
took
the
locket
up
again
and
as
she
did
so
remembered
that
the
woman
had
murmured
yorke
name
yes
it
was
yorke
she
laid
the
locket
down
again
gently
this
time
and
bent
over
the
white
face
of
the
woman
with
a
strange
confusing
throbbing
in
her
heart
a
loud
singing
in
her
ears
the
earth
seemed
to
rock
beneath
her
the
sky
to
be
falling
she
was
faint
with
physical
exhaustion
with
the
terrible
struggle
for
life
and
this
discovery
coming
so
closely
upon
all
she
had
endured
almost
crushed
her
was
she
really
awake
or
asleep
and
dreaming
delirious
perhaps
yorke
her
yorke
face
lying
there
on
this
woman
heart
it
was
incredible
all
this
had
passed
through
her
mind
her
heart
in
a
few
seconds
one
can
crowd
an
awful
amount
of
misery
anguish
joy
into
a
minute
and
by
this
time
the
woman
had
recovered
where
am
i
she
breathed
staring
up
at
leslie
leslie
did
not
answer
but
continued
to
gaze
at
her
with
wide
open
eyes
in
which
a
horror
was
growing
more
intense
each
moment
where
am
i
have
i
been
ill
ah
she
drew
a
deep
breath
i
remember
are
we
safe
why
do
we
go
what
are
we
staying
for
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
half
sat
up
pushing
the
black
hair
from
her
face
and
passing
her
hand
across
her
eyes
then
she
looked
down
and
saw
the
locket
and
her
hand
flew
to
it
leslie
eyes
followed
the
hand
whose
whose
portrait
is
that
she
asked
almost
inaudibly
the
woman
looked
at
her
and
a
dull
red
stole
into
her
face
what
that
to
you
she
retorted
half
defiantly
you
looked
at
it
have
you
leslie
moistened
her
lips
they
were
so
hot
and
dry
that
she
could
scarcely
speak
yes
i
have
looked
at
it
she
said
i
know
you
know
who
it
is
as
she
spoke
she
closed
the
locket
hurriedly
and
buttoned
her
dress
over
it
you
know
who
are
you
what
is
your
name
and
the
dark
eyes
scanned
leslie
pale
face
with
suspicious
scrutiny
my
name
is
leslie
leslie
lisle
said
leslie
slowly
leslie
the
woman
sprang
to
her
feet
what
you
are
the
girl
he
left
me
for
she
breathed
leslie
shuddered
and
her
lips
quivered
oh
there
must
be
some
mistake
she
almost
wailed
it
can
not
be
he
and
yet
you
spoke
his
name
yorke
yorke
yes
that
his
name
and
this
is
his
portrait
was
the
sharp
response
and
you
are
the
girl
he
fallen
in
love
with
and
i
never
guessed
it
i
must
have
been
a
fool
not
to
have
thought
of
it
jumped
at
it
it
lucky
for
you
that
i
did
she
added
between
her
teeth
i
have
killed
you
down
there
leslie
shrank
back
and
instinctively
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
ward
off
an
attack
what
what
is
your
name
she
asked
my
name
the
full
lips
curled
with
bitter
contempt
you
must
have
been
out
of
the
world
not
to
know
it
she
said
my
name
finetta
i
finetta
of
the
diadem
finetta
finetta
of
the
diadem
leslie
repeated
mechanically
was
it
all
a
hideous
dream
who
was
finetta
of
the
diadem
and
how
could
she
talk
of
yorke
as
if
he
belonged
to
her
how
did
it
happen
that
she
wore
his
portrait
on
her
heart
yes
finetta
of
the
diadem
said
finetta
defiantly
i
should
have
thought
everybody
knew
me
but
i
suppose
he
has
told
you
about
me
no
that
was
likely
and
she
laughed
hoarsely
what
are
you
staring
at
me
like
that
for
as
if
i
was
a
a
wild
animal
leslie
put
her
hand
to
her
brow
with
a
piteous
little
gesture
i
i
it
is
all
so
sudden
give
me
time
i
do
not
wish
to
anger
you
i
only
want
to
ask
you
a
a
question
one
or
two
questions
why
do
you
wear
that
portrait
in
that
locket
finetta
looked
at
her
a
moment
in
silence
then
with
a
flash
of
her
eyes
and
a
discordant
laugh
she
replied
that
a
question
to
ask
me
if
you
like
what
do
you
think
i
wear
it
for
the
red
deepened
on
her
face
then
left
it
pale
what
does
a
woman
usually
wear
a
man
portrait
for
i
be
bound
you
got
one
of
his
too
leslie
hand
went
to
her
bosom
to
the
sparkling
pendant
and
she
shook
her
head
with
a
strange
feeling
of
injury
he
had
sent
her
diamonds
but
he
had
given
this
woman
something
far
more
precious
no
she
breathed
almost
unconsciously
did
he
give
it
to
you
oh
answer
me
quickly
and
and
truthfully
i
will
tell
you
why
i
ask
i
will
tell
you
all
i
i
am
to
be
his
wife
i
was
to
be
his
wife
at
the
change
from
am
to
be
to
was
to
be
finetta
eyes
flashed
and
she
lowered
her
lids
sit
down
she
said
pointing
to
a
piece
of
rock
leslie
sank
down
upon
it
and
waited
with
averted
face
she
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
the
dark
defiant
face
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
a
fallen
angel
at
this
moment
a
face
distorted
and
lined
by
conflicting
passions
you
were
to
be
his
wife
were
you
said
finetta
slowly
with
a
breath
between
each
word
so
was
i
you
the
word
dropped
from
leslie
white
lips
unconsciously
it
seemed
to
sting
finetta
yes
me
she
flamed
out
why
not
you
speak
and
you
look
at
me
as
if
as
if
i
was
some
monster
i
i
as
young
and
as
good
looking
as
you
leslie
put
up
her
hand
deprecatingly
yes
yes
she
murmured
i
did
not
mean
to
anger
you
go
on
oh
go
on
why
should
he
marry
me
as
much
as
you
continued
finetta
known
him
longer
than
you
have
i
been
more
to
him
than
you
have
leslie
shuddered
i
as
good
as
you
are
who
are
you
you
no
more
of
a
swell
than
i
am
and
you
poor
too
ai
you
and
i
not
poor
i
can
earn
thousands
a
year
she
stopped
panting
leslie
glanced
at
her
shrinkingly
and
if
it
comes
to
caring
for
him
i
reckon
i
care
for
him
quite
as
much
as
you
do
you
know
that
for
you
heard
me
talk
down
there
when
i
thought
it
was
all
over
with
us
and
as
for
him
well
i
wager
everything
i
got
that
in
his
heart
he
likes
me
as
well
as
he
likes
you
or
anyone
else
she
laughed
bitterly
and
with
self
scorn
and
contempt
no
no
broke
from
leslie
quivering
lips
but
i
say
yes
yes
retorted
finetta
he
just
like
the
rest
none
of
could
stick
to
one
of
us
alone
to
save
his
life
you
must
have
lived
with
your
head
buried
in
the
sand
not
to
know
that
what
you
think
that
you
the
only
one
he
has
made
love
to
or
that
i
the
only
other
one
she
laughed
again
ask
him
whether
he
knows
lady
eleanor
dallas
see
how
he
looks
when
he
hears
her
name
and
hear
what
he
says
leslie
looked
at
her
with
half
dazed
eyes
and
listened
with
ears
in
which
the
wild
sea
seemed
roaring
it
is
false
false
she
cried
hoarsely
i
will
not
believe
and
she
put
up
her
hands
as
if
to
cover
her
ears
finetta
laughed
well
she
said
with
a
sneer
he
deceived
you
easily
enough
anyone
could
see
and
if
i
was
so
sorry
for
myself
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
for
you
leslie
shuddered
to
be
pitied
by
this
woman
this
terrible
woman
look
here
said
finetta
after
a
pause
do
mind
my
hard
words
it
my
way
when
i
put
out
i
can
see
you
do
believe
half
i
say
and
that
only
natural
i
should
if
i
were
in
your
place
and
did
know
him
so
well
if
you
doubt
that
we
are
both
talking
of
the
same
man
take
this
locket
and
look
at
it
again
and
she
held
it
out
leslie
turned
her
head
from
it
no
you
do
want
to
look
at
it
again
i
daresay
you
knew
his
face
directly
you
saw
it
now
do
you
think
he
have
given
it
to
me
if
he
had
cared
for
me
answer
that
leslie
looked
at
her
a
sudden
wild
hope
springing
into
her
bosom
it
it
was
a
long
while
ago
she
breathed
a
long
while
ago
finetta
broke
in
with
a
discordant
laugh
not
a
bit
of
it
it
was
three
days
ago
he
sent
it
after
spending
an
evening
with
me
as
he
spent
many
a
score
she
saw
a
look
of
unbelief
crossing
leslie
face
and
snatching
a
letter
from
her
pocket
thrust
it
under
leslie
face
read
that
and
believe
she
said
leslie
took
the
note
and
looked
at
it
the
lines
swam
before
her
eyes
but
she
saw
a
word
here
and
there
and
with
a
low
cry
which
broke
from
her
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
to
suppress
it
she
held
out
the
note
from
her
finetta
took
it
and
restored
it
to
her
pocket
then
stood
and
looked
down
at
the
motionless
figure
in
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
you
believe
now
she
said
in
a
low
harsh
voice
you
see
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
and
not
a
pack
of
lies
and
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
wait
a
minute
let
see
how
the
land
lies
here
am
i
who
who
cared
for
him
for
years
who
would
have
been
his
wife
if
if
he
had
happened
to
have
seen
you
and
mind
i
just
as
fit
to
be
his
wife
as
you
are
why
come
to
that
he
tire
of
you
ever
so
much
sooner
than
he
would
of
me
because
you
have
any
money
and
i
have
and
can
go
on
earning
enough
to
keep
him
amused
do
you
see
we
been
fond
of
each
other
for
ever
so
long
why
there
been
scarcely
a
day
for
months
past
that
we
have
been
together
and
even
when
he
smitten
by
you
he
does
throw
me
over
you
see
he
sends
me
his
portrait
and
a
sweetheart
note
with
it
yes
and
just
after
left
you
too
now
that
how
i
stand
and
now
where
are
you
only
known
him
a
few
days
you
ca
care
for
him
half
half
no
not
as
much
as
i
do
that
only
natural
and
it
only
natural
and
right
that
you
should
give
him
up
think
it
over
after
all
miss
lisle
she
went
on
with
a
kind
of
sullen
insinuation
he
behaved
very
badly
to
you
he
has
indeed
he
never
meant
to
throw
me
quite
over
he
have
come
back
to
me
sooner
or
later
leslie
half
rose
from
the
rock
and
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
put
the
words
the
insinuation
from
her
then
sank
back
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
he
have
come
back
to
me
and
then
you
have
been
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
you
are
now
leslie
did
not
move
and
finetta
watching
her
closely
allowed
a
minute
to
pass
in
silence
that
her
words
might
sink
in
come
now
miss
lisle
there
no
occasion
for
you
and
me
to
quarrel
why
when
you
think
of
it
you
and
me
have
saved
each
other
lives
have
we
and
we
ought
we
really
ought
to
act
square
and
straight
by
one
another
i
the
one
that
been
badly
treated
because
he
loved
me
first
and
would
have
married
me
but
for
you
just
think
of
that
from
what
i
seen
of
you
i
should
say
that
you
were
a
lady
and
one
that
would
injure
a
fellow
woman
i
should
say
you
were
too
proud
to
rob
a
poor
girl
of
the
man
she
loved
leslie
sprang
up
panting
and
for
a
moment
breathless
the
horror
the
humiliation
were
driving
her
mad
oh
be
silent
be
silent
let
me
think
she
breathed
every
word
you
speak
stabs
me
she
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
with
a
passionate
gesture
that
awed
finetta
it
is
all
so
sudden
that
that
i
can
not
realize
it
can
scarcely
believe
oh
do
not
speak
i
believe
all
you
say
you
have
shown
me
the
note
the
portrait
is
his
and
i
can
not
but
believe
and
i
trusted
him
ah
how
i
trusted
him
her
voice
broke
for
a
moment
and
her
eyes
swam
with
tears
but
she
dashed
them
away
with
her
hand
and
hurried
on
with
every
now
and
then
a
break
between
the
words
but
what
you
say
is
true
he
he
belongs
to
you
more
than
to
me
he
has
wronged
us
both
but
he
has
wronged
you
the
more
cruelly
and
she
stopped
and
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
as
if
she
were
suffocating
and
i
i
give
him
back
to
you
yes
i
give
him
back
to
you
the
blood
rushed
to
finetta
face
then
left
it
pale
to
the
lips
you
you
throw
him
up
she
said
as
if
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
leslie
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
her
steadily
with
a
look
that
would
have
melted
the
heart
of
anyone
but
a
rival
he
belongs
to
you
not
to
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
as
if
every
word
cost
her
a
heart
pang
i
i
will
never
see
him
again
if
i
can
help
it
do
not
she
paused
and
a
sigh
broke
from
her
white
lips
do
not
let
him
know
do
not
tell
him
that
i
have
seen
you
i
i
have
loved
him
and
would
spare
him
the
shame
there
was
silence
for
a
second
finetta
gazing
on
the
ground
with
set
face
and
hidden
eyes
if
if
he
should
ever
know
that
we
met
and
that
you
told
me
what
you
have
told
me
tell
him
that
i
yes
that
i
forgive
him
that
i
have
forgiven
and
forgotten
him
that
is
all
her
head
sank
for
a
moment
then
she
raised
it
again
and
looked
at
the
dark
face
with
a
shrinking
kind
of
reluctance
you
you
say
that
you
care
for
him
finetta
lips
moved
yes
and
i
know
that
you
do
be
good
to
him
do
not
let
the
thought
that
he
deceived
himself
into
thinking
he
cared
for
me
come
between
you

you
that
note

try
and
make
him

her
voice
broke
and
she
turned
her
head
away
finetta
stood
with
clenched
hands
her
teeth
gnawing
at
her
under
lip
then
she
sprang
to
leslie
side
and
took
her
hand
miss
lisle
leslie
shook
her
hand
off
with
a
little
cry
a
shudder
do
do
touch
me
please
finetta
froze
instantly
i
i
beg
your
pardon
panted
leslie
but
i
can
not
bear
any
more
if
you
would
go
now
that
road
leads
to
portmaris
she
sank
on
the
stone
and
sat
with
her
head
erect
and
face
set
hard
as
the
stone
itself
finetta
drew
her
jacket
round
her
and
fumbled
with
her
gloves
i
understand
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
done
the
right
thing
and
you
wo
be
sorry
for
it
it
is
nearly
two
miles
to
portmaris
said
leslie
in
a
dry
expressionless
voice
there
is
an
evening
train
you
can
catch
it
if
you
walk
quickly
i
going
said
finetta
biting
her
lips
miss
leslie
sorry
well
leslie
sat
motionless
and
with
averted
face
until
the
graceful
figure
of
the
dancing
girl
of
the
diadem
had
disappeared
below
the
hill
then
with
a
cry
she
rose
her
arms
above
her
head
and
fell
full
length
upon
the
turf
chapter

fame
has
come
to
me
at
last
leslie
lay
unconscious
while
the
sun
sank
below
the
horizon
and
the
delicious
summer
gloaming
came
softly
upon
the
moor
lay
like
a
flower
struck
down
by
some
rude
hand
and
the
evening
star
shone
pale
in
the
sky
before
she
came
back
to
life
and
her
great
sorrow
for
a
while
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
whole
scene
through
which
she
had
passed
was
a
hideous
dream
and
when
its
reality
came
crushing
down
upon
her
she
uttered
a
low
cry
and
shivered
as
if
with
cold
the
sudden
destruction
of
her
joy
and
happiness
left
her
stunned
and
bewildered
a
few
short
hours
ago
and
she
and
yorke
had
been
sitting
hand
in
hand
heart
to
heart
talking
of
their
marriage
and
now
now
he
was
hers
no
longer
in
a
sense
he
had
never
been
hers
but
all
the
time
he
had
been
wooing
her
forcing
her
to
love
him
he
had
been
in
honor
bound
to
this
other
woman
as
she
thought
of
her
this
finetta
this
woman
with
the
bold
eyes
a
feeling
of
shame
and
humiliation
was
added
to
the
misery
of
loss
that
he
yorke
her
idol
her
king
should
ever
have
stooped
to
love
such
a
woman
seemed
to
her
unspeakably
base
and
terrible
she
had
set
him
on
so
lofty
a
pedestal
had
regarded
him
as
so
noble
and
that
the
knowledge
of
his
falseness
to
both
of
them
hurt
her
like
a
physical
blow
she
sat
for
some
time
waiting
for
strength
to
enable
her
to
reach
home
and
as
she
sat
and
looked
round
it
seemed
as
if
something
had
gone
out
of
her
life
as
if
a
weight
which
no
power
nor
time
could
lift
had
fallen
upon
her
heart
before
her
she
saw
stretching
in
a
dull
grey
hopeless
vista
the
many
years
she
would
probably
have
to
live
the
long
life
without
yorke
and
haunted
by
the
memory
of
these
few
happy
days
if
i
had
never
seen
him
if
i
had
not
loved
him
so
dearly
was
the
burden
of
her
heart
wail
or
if
i
had
only
died
down
there
before
i
saw
the
locket
or
heard
the
woman
story
she
had
fought
death
hard
enough
a
little
while
ago
now
she
would
have
welcomed
him
she
rose
at
last
and
went
slowly
and
draggingly
towards
portmaris
her
dress
was
still
heavy
with
the
salt
water
she
was
weak
with
physical
and
mental
weariness
and
the
two
miles
across
the
moor
were
surely
the
longest
that
ever
woman
journeyed
when
she
reached
the
villa
and
entered
the
parlor
she
found
her
father
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
dusk
before
his
easel
he
looked
up
but
fortunately
for
her
did
not
see
her
white
weary
face
or
notice
how
she
held
the
door
as
if
to
support
herself
where
have
you
been
leslie
he
asked
in
a
kind
of
irritable
excitement
i
have
been
wanting
you
temple
has
sent
the
notes
for
the
picture
the
fifty
pounds
she
leant
against
the
door
and
drew
a
long
breath
as
she
thought
of
this
added
humiliation
he
is
going
it
seems
and
wished
to
er
pay
for
the
picture
before
he
left
his
departure
is
rather
sudden
i
think
but
i
fancy
he
is
erratic
in
his
movements
i
want
you
to
send
him
a
receipt
and
er
to
ask
him
to
allow
the
picture
to
be
exhibited
yes
papa
she
said
faintly
why
not
he
asked
testily
i
i
am
tired
very
tired
she
said
going
to
him
and
leaning
her
head
on
his
shoulder
you
walked
too
far
he
said
in
a
tone
of
complaint
you
better
go
to
bed
at
once
the
receipt
and
the
letter
must
wait
till
i
suppose
oh
there
was
something
oh
yes
did
you
see
the
duke
he
came
up
to
me
on
the
beach
and
inquired
for
you
she
turned
away
from
him
a
lump
rising
in
her
throat
and
threatening
to
suffocate
her
yes
did
he
say
anything
about
that
sketch
of
st
martin
martin
how
the
name
brought
back
the
memory
of
that
happy
happy
day
i
do
quite
know
about
that
sketch
he
went
on
with
an
air
of
importance
i
may
be
too
much
engaged
on
important
pictures
to
er
spare
any
time
for
small
sketches
however
that
matter
can
rest
for
the
present
the
duke
has
gone
back
to
london
they
tell
me
by
the
way
i
wish
you
would
prepare
a
fresh
canvas
for
me
not
oh
not
dear
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
go
to
bed
as
you
said
for
i
am
very
very
tired
she
left
the
sentence
unfinished
and
crept
up
to
her
own
room
what
an
awful
line
of
dreary
stretched
before
her
was
her
thought
as
she
took
off
her
dress
the
diamond
pendant
flashed
in
the
candlelight
each
gem
seeming
to
glitter
mockingly
in
derision
of
her
love
and
faith
and
trust
she
covered
the
sparkling
thing
with
her
hand
and
bowed
her
head
over
it
the
very
day
he
had
sent
it
to
her
he
had
given
his
portrait
his
portrait
to
that
other
woman
she
took
the
pendant
off
the
ribbon
and
wrapped
it
in
a
piece
of
soft
paper
and
put
it
away
out
of
sight
in
a
small
box
and
as
she
did
so
she
saw
ralph
duncombe
ring
one
own
misery
recalls
to
us
that
of
other
people
and
in
this
the
hour
of
her
trouble
leslie
remembered
ralph
duncombe
and
for
the
first
time
she
realized
something
of
what
he
had
suffered
with
a
rush
his
passionate
avowal
came
back
upon
her
and
she
took
the
ring
in
her
hand
and
looked
at
it
with
a
double
misery
he
had
sworn
to
help
her
if
she
ever
should
be
in
trouble
had
sworn
to
help
her
if
ever
she
suffered
wrong
how
feeble
had
been
his
vow
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
could
help
her
in
this
strait
and
as
to
vengeance
she
wanted
none
alas
alas
false
as
he
had
been
she
loved
yorke
still
she
fell
asleep
at
last
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
did
not
awake
until
past
nine
then
it
all
came
throbbing
crowding
back
upon
her
in
that
first
awful
moment
of
waking
surely
to
the
wretched
and
unhappy
there
is
no
more
awful
hour
in
the
than
that
which
follows
the
morning
awakening
sorrow
seems
to
have
had
time
to
sharpen
her
arrows
during
the
night
and
plunges
them
with
fresh
vigor
into
our
aching
hearts
while
she
was
dressing
leslie
went
over
the
whole
of
the
incidents
of
the
previous
day
bit
by
bit
and
suddenly
with
the
sharpness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
a
gleam
of
hope
shot
across
the
darkness
of
her
misery
suppose
this
woman
had
lied
such
women
as
she
would
find
no
difficulty
in
stooping
to
untruth
and
deception
suppose
she
had
got
possession
of
yorke
portrait
had
forged
the
letter
had
concocted
the
whole
story
the
supposition
seemed
and
improbable
but
it
sent
a
thrill
of
hope
through
her
and
she
finished
dressing
with
feverish
haste
and
hurried
downstairs
all
through
the
breakfast
she
felt
like
one
in
a
dream
as
if
she
were
suspended
between
life
and
death
and
waiting
for
the
verdict
her
father
talked
of
his
picture
of
all
he
meant
to
do
now
that
he
was
on
the
high
road
to
fame
and
his
voice
sounded
in
her
ears
like
that
of
someone
speaking
afar
off
yorke
her
yorke
might
prove
to
be
hers
still
oh
blessed
hope
how
mad
how
wicked
how
foolish
she
had
been
to
put
any
trust
in
the
woman
who
had
slandered
him
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
so
great
that
it
sent
a
hectic
flush
to
her
face
and
a
feverish
light
to
her
eyes
that
receipt
and
note
leslie
said
her
father
tell
temple
that
i
would
rather
not
sell
the
picture
that
i
would
rather
return
his
money
than
forego
the
right
of
exhibiting
the
picture
yes
yes
papa
she
said
at
random
yes
it
will
all
come
right
it
was
wicked
foolish
to
doubt
him
to
believe
her
he
stared
at
her
with
irritable
impatience
what
are
you
talking
of
leslie
he
said
peevishly
you
seem
very
strange
this
morning
and
so
you
were
last
night
i
know
i
know
dear
she
broke
in
with
something
between
a
sigh
and
a
sob
do
mind
me
i
am
not
very
well
you
want
the
receipt
she
sprang
to
the
writing
table
there
it
is
and
the
note
yes
yes
it
will
come
right
i
know
it
will
and
and
oh
how
hot
it
is
i
must
have
air
air
she
caught
up
her
hat
and
with
the
receipt
and
note
in
her
hand
ran
to
the
door
i
shall
see
temple
papa
and
i
will
give
him
these
and
tell
him
he
called
after
her
that
i
make
it
a
condition
that
the
picture
shall
be
exhibited
mind
that
leslie
yes
yes
she
responded
and
ran
out
she
drew
her
breath
hard
as
she
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
doorstep
then
she
hurried
to
the
quay
a
fisherman
was
drying
his
net
in
the
sun
but
there
was
no
one
else
there
and
she
walked
up
and
down
the
note
in
her
hand
repeating
to
herself
the
formula
of
hope
the
woman
finetta
had
lied
to
her
and
deceived
her
all
would
be
well
yorke
would
be
her
yorke
still
she
had
not
been
walking
thus
very
long
before
the
bath
chair
wheeled
by
grey
was
seen
coming
on
to
the
quay
she
hurried
toward
it
and
the
duke
motioned
to
grey
to
stop
good
morning
miss
leslie
he
said
peering
up
at
her
it
is
a
fine
morning
is
it
then
he
paused
and
scanned
her
face
curiously
and
earnestly
is
anything
the
matter
the
matter
she
repeated
with
a
laugh
that
sounded
in
her
ears
hollow
and
unnatural
what
should
be
the
matter
i
have
brought
you
my
father
receipt
and
a
note
mr
temple
he
took
it
and
glanced
at
it
humph
he
said
oh
yes
i
do
anything
your
father
wishes
and
there
is
nothing
the
matter
miss
leslie
and
he
peered
up
at
her
curiously
from
under
his
thick
brows
nothing
nothing
she
responded
feverishly
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
the
duke
the
duke
of
rothbury
his
pale
face
flushed
and
he
motioned
to
grey
to
withdraw
out
of
hearing
i
thought
so
he
said
miss
leslie
sick
men
like
me
acquire
a
kind
of
second
sight
directly
i
saw
you
just
now
i
knew
that
you
had
learnt
the
truth
she
looked
down
at
him
and
her
face
which
had
been
flushed
feverishly
paled
the
truth
she
faltered
yes
he
said
in
a
tone
that
suggested
remorse
you
have
been
cruelly
deceived
deceived
she
echoed
the
word
as
if
its
significance
were
lost
upon
her
deceived
yes
cruelly
but
you
must
not
blame
him
altogether
blame
him
whom
she
said
slowly
yorke
yorke
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
was
as
much
my
fault
as
his
i
ought
to
have
told
you
we
have
both
deceived
you
wickedly
inexcusably
leslie
put
out
her
hand
and
caught
the
chair
and
stood
looking
down
at
him
blame
me
more
than
him
he
went
on
blame
us
both
we
ought
to
have
told
you
at
any
rate
however
we
kept
other
people
in
the
dark
but
he
was
not
free
and
i
well
i
held
my
tongue
he
was
not
free
she
murmured
mechanically
no
i
do
ask
you
to
forgive
us
you
find
it
too
hard
i
expect
you
even
to
understand
the
motive
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
wait
stop
let
me
think
he
has
deceived
me
then
he
has
and
i
have
yes
he
said
averting
his
eyes
from
the
misery
in
her
face
is
it
so
hard
and
bitter
a
blow
leslie
he
said
after
a
pause
yes
she
responded
almost
unconsciously
i
hoped
that
that
but
it
does
not
matter
nothing
matters
now
he
fidgeted
in
his
chair
and
peered
up
at
her
curiously
strangely
anyway
you
know
the
truth
now
yes
i
know
the
truth
now
she
echoed
faintly
why
hoarsely
why
did
he
do
it
the
duke
bit
his
lip
it
was
more
my
fault
than
his
i
ought
to
have
told
you
i
did
not
know
did
not
know
that
you
would
take
it
so
much
to
heart
for
sake
do
look
so
wretched
so
heartbroken
he
burst
forth
leslie
you
make
me
feel
like
a
criminal
she
turned
her
white
face
to
him
you
let
me
love
him
go
on
loving
him
knowing
all
the
while
he
hung
his
head
and
plucked
at
the
edge
of
the
shawl
across
his
knees
i
did
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
tell
you
so
god
forgive
you
she
panted
god
forgive
you
and
him
she
stood
a
moment
as
if
struggling
for
breath
and
turned
and
walked
swiftly
away
the
duke
sat
for
a
full
five
minutes
staring
at
the
front
wheel
of
his
chair
then
he
jerked
his
hand
up
and
called
to
grey
take
me
home
he
snapped
what
the
devil
are
you
waiting
for
take
me
home
and
back
to
london
as
soon
as
possible
leslie
sped
along
the
quay
and
staggered
rather
than
walked
into
the
sitting
room
and
a
moment
afterward
her
father
hurried
in
leslie
leslie
he
cried
where
are
you
she
lifted
her
head
from
the
sofa
cushion
with
dull
blinded
eyes
here
a
telegram
a
telegram
from
one
of
the
large
dealers

she
rose
and
staggered
to
her
feet
no

paused
and
clutched
his
arm
laughing
hysterically
do

chapter
xxiii
and
not
adieu
leslie
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
as
she
listened
to
her
excited
words
what
should
she
do
she
asked
herself
should
she
tell
him
that
she
had
deceived
him
that
the
message
from
the
picture
dealer
was
a
mere
subterfuge
a
trick
to
get
him
and
her
up
to
town
but
she
could
not
tell
him
this
without
explaining
fully
without
disclosing
the
whole
story
of
her
love
for
yorke
and
the
deceit
he
had
practiced
on
her
and
she
shrank
from
the
ordeal
as
one
shrinks
from
fire
she
stood
pale
and
trembling
her
hands
writhing
together
her
brain
swimming
watching
her
father
as
he
hurried
to
and
fro
picking
up
some
article
and
putting
it
down
again
in
another
place
under
the
impression
that
he
was
packing
oh
papa
she
faltered
out
at
last
do
go
do
not
go
write
and
and
ask
oh
i
implore
you
not
to
go
francis
lisle
stopped
in
his
flurried
fidgeting
about
the
room
and
stared
at
her
with
impatient
annoyance
my
dear
leslie
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
he
exclaimed
you
look
half
distraught
i
am
i
am
ah
if
you
only
knew
she
almost
sobbed
knew
what
he
demanded
irritably
what
is
it
you
are
talking
about
any
one
would
think
we
were
going
to
to
australia
instead
of
only
to
london
and
not
go
good
heavens
why
should
we
not
go
i
tell
you
this
is
one
of
the
first
dealers
in
london
and
and
it
is
the
great
opening
i
have
been
waiting
for
expecting
all
my
life
it
was
unendurable
she
went
to
him
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
let
her
head
fall
on
his
shoulder
oh
papa
papa
do
not
be
too
confident
too
hopeful
you
you
may
be
disappointed
life
is
full
of
disappointment
her
voice
broke
you
may
be
sorry
that
you
have
gone
up
write
let
me
write
to
this
dealer
he
put
her
from
him
almost
roughly
you
are
talking
nonsense
he
said
sheer
nonsense
why
should
this
dealer
write
to
me
and
ask
me
to
come
up
at
once
at
once
mind
unless
he
had
some
important
commission
for
me
she
knew
why
but
she
could
not
answer
she
dared
not
she
dreaded
the
effect
of
the
shock
which
the
disclosure
the
disappointment
would
cause
him
he
was
trembling
with
excitement
as
it
was
and
the
reaction
would
be
more
than
he
could
endure
there
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
soothing
her
i
can
understand
your
being
upset
and
unnerved
it
is
only
natural
i
even
i
am
a
little
er
flurried
but
do
collect
yourself
and
get
ready
we
shall
go
up
by
the
evening
train
take
all
our
clothes
for
we
may
be
up
some
time
i
ca
tell
what
this
dealer
may
want
or
or
where
he
may
send
me
there
do
collect
yourself
and
get
ready
wait
give
me
a
little
brandy
and
water
the
suddenness
of
this
this
change
in
our
fortunes
has
agitated
me
she
got
him
some
weak
brandy
and
water
and
she
noticed
as
he
drank
it
how
his
hand
shook
then
she
stole
up
to
her
own
room
and
began
to
pack
mechanically
like
one
in
a
dream
gradually
she
began
to
realize
that
after
all
it
was
better
perhaps
that
they
should
leave
portmaris
yorke
the
mere
passing
of
his
name
across
her
mind
caused
her
a
pang
might
come
down
after
her
when
he
found
that
she
had
not
gone
to
london
and
sent
him
her
address
and
she
felt
that
a
meeting
with
him
would
nearly
kill
her
at
all
costs
that
must
be
avoided
in
her
heart
throbbed
only
one
prayer
that
while
life
lasted
she
might
be
spared
the
agony
of
seeing
his
face
hearing
his
voice
again
she
finished
her
preparations
for
herself
and
her
father
and
went
downstairs
and
helped
him
pack
the
absurd
and
worthless
canvases
then
she
went
out
to
say
to
the
old
place
something
a
presentment
as
strong
as
certainty
told
her
that
she
was
indeed
saying
and
not
adieu
she
wandered
along
the
quay
and
stood
looking
sadly
at
the
breakwater
against
which
she
had
sat
when
ralph
duncombe
had
declared
his
love
and
given
her
his
ring
on
which
yorke
had
been
lying
the
night
she
and
he
had
gone
for
a
sail
was
it
only
a
few
weeks
or
years
ago
that
all
this
had
happened
to
her
there
were
some
children
on
the
quay
the
children
who
had
learned
to
love
her
and
amongst
them
the
mite
she
had
held
in
her
arms
the
morning
yorke
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
they
clustered
around
her
as
usual
and
she
had
hard
work
to
keep
the
tears
from
her
eyes
they
were
in
her
voice
as
she
kissed
them
coming
back
soon
mith
lethlie
lisped
trottie
her
favorite
and
leslie
murmured
yes
she
would
come
back
soon
when
she
got
back
to
sea
view
she
found
her
father
ready
to
start
and
in
an
impatient
anxiety
to
do
so
we
are
going
to
london
on
important
business
merrick
leslie
heard
him
saying
to
merrick
most
important
business
i
er
anticipate
a
change
in
our
circumstances
a
great
change
the
world
has
at
last
awakened
to
the
fact
that
my
pictures
are
not
er
without
merit
he
laughed
with
a
kind
of
bombastic
modesty
oh
yes
we
shall
come
back
to
our
old
friends
merrick
we
shall
not
forget
sea
view
and
er
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
world
of
art
will
not
forget
it
some
day
possibly
sea
view
will
become
celebrated
as
the
temporary
residence
of
one
of
england
first
artists
eh
leslie
and
he
smiled
at
her
with
a
childish
conceit
merrick
not
understanding
in
the
least
smiled
and
curtseyed
i
sure
we
very
sorry
to
lose
you
sir
and
miss
leslie
especially
i
do
know
what
portmaris
will
do
without
her
that
i
do
we
shall
be
quite
dull
now
for
a
bit
for
temple
the
crippled
gentleman
has
gone
off
you
will
be
sure
and
send
me
your
address
yes
yes
said
francis
lisle
and
er
if
we
hear
of
anyone
wanting
clean
and
comfortable
lodgings
we
shall
certainly
remember
to
recommend
you
mrs
merrick
he
went
off
in
the
broken
down
fly
like
a
prince
with
his
canvases
piled
round
him
and
oblivious
of
everything
but
them
during
the
journey
up
to
town
he
spoke
very
little
but
sat
in
his
corner
looking
out
of
the
window
a
smile
of
every
now
and
then
passing
over
his
thin
worn
face
i
should
be
surprised
leslie
he
said
once
if
this
should
prove
to
be
the
last
time
we
travel
third
class
i
shall
ask
and
no
doubt
obtain
a
fair
price
for
my
pictures
and
we
shall
at
last
at
last
be
rich
enough
to
afford
a
little
luxury
they
say
that
everything
comes
to
him
who
can
wait
and
i
think
i
have
waited
long
enough
long
enough
leslie
pale
face
flushed
and
her
conscience
tortured
her
but
she
could
not
summon
up
courage
to
tell
him
the
truth
they
reached
town
late
in
the
summer
evening
and
leslie
calling
a
cab
told
the
man
to
drive
to
a
house
in
torrington
square
at
which
they
had
stayed
on
previous
visits
to
london
torrington
square
is
a
quiet
secluded
spot
in
the
great
metropolis
it
is
central
and
yet
retired
nearly
every
house
is
let
in
apartments
and
the
square
is
the
favorite
residence
of
the
journalists
and
artists
who
pay
occasional
visits
to
london
the
landlady
of
no
received
leslie
and
her
father
as
if
they
were
old
friends
instead
of
transient
lodgers
and
she
expressed
her
concern
at
the
appearance
of
lisle
he
do
look
well
miss
lisle
she
said
in
a
stage
whisper
as
they
went
in
with
their
baggage
been
in
the
country
too
ah
i
often
says
there
no
place
like
london
for
health
and
you
too
begging
your
pardon
miss
do
look
too
rosy
what
you
want
is
brightening
up
and
there
no
place
like
london
for
brightening
up
that
i
will
say
leslie
smiled
sadly
she
knew
that
she
looked
pale
and
wan
but
it
hurt
her
to
hear
that
her
father
was
not
looking
well
she
got
him
to
bed
early
but
directly
after
breakfast
he
was
all
anxiety
to
go
down
to
the
picture
dealer
who
had
brought
him
to
town
can
i
not
go
alone
dear
while
you
rest
she
said
but
he
scouted
the
suggestion
no
no
i
will
go
women
are
all
very
well
but
a
man
is
needed
for
business
of
this
kind
get
some
of
the
best
of
my
pictures
together
and
we
will
go
in
a
cab
leslie
got
ready
and
all
the
time
she
was
putting
on
her
outdoor
things
she
thought
of
the
arrangement
with
yorke
she
was
to
have
sent
him
her
address
to
the
dorchester
club
he
was
waiting
for
it
now
expecting
it
every
minute
she
could
imagine
his
impatience
could
picture
to
herself
how
he
would
walk
up
and
down
fuming
for
the
telegram
with
a
heavy
heart
she
tied
up
the
least
ridiculous
of
her
pictures
and
sent
out
for
a
cab
and
told
the
man
to
drive
to
bond
street
to
the
picture
dealer
a
hectic
flush
burned
in
francis
lisle
thin
cheeks
and
leslie
saw
his
lips
move
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
himself
telling
himself
that
fame
and
prosperity
were
awaiting
him
oh
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
when
first
we
practice
to
deceive
if
she
had
not
consented
to
deceive
her
father
she
would
not
now
be
in
this
awful
strait
she
was
actually
leading
him
to
the
bitterest
disappointment
of
his
life
there
are
picture
dealers
and
picture
dealers
arnheim
of
bond
street
is
one
of
the
best
known
men
and
the
most
respected
many
an
artist
now
famous
and
wealthy
owes
his
first
step
up
the
ladder
to
arnheim
he
will
buy
anything
that
shows
promise
and
for
great
works
will
give
as
much
and
more
than
a
private
purchaser
his
judgment
is
almost
infallible
and
to
be
spoken
well
of
by
arnheim
is
to
have
a
passport
to
artistic
fame
the
cab
drew
up
at
his
house
which
was
near
the
corner
in
one
of
the
turnings
out
of
bond
street
and
had
nothing
about
it
to
indicate
the
nature
of
his
business
save
and
excepting
a
very
small
brass
plate
with
arnheim
on
it
a
page
boy
opened
the
door
in
response
to
leslie
ring
and
on
learning
her
name
ushered
her
and
her
father
upstairs
into
a
room
hung
round
with
pictures
and
giving
them
chairs
disappeared
through
a
door
in
a
partition
which
seemed
to
screen
off
a
kind
of
office
leslie
heart
beat
apprehensively
and
her
face
grew
paler
but
francis
lisle
looked
round
with
a
kind
of
suppressed
exultation
there
are
examples
of
some
of
our
best
known
artists
here
leslie
he
said
in
a
voice
quavering
with
excitement
there
one
of
he
mentioned
the
name
and
that
is
sir
frederick
this
arnheim
is
one
of
the
first
the
first
dealers
in
the
world
and
never
makes
a
mistake
never
he
would
not
have
sent
for
me
unless
he
had
seen
some
of
my
pictures
and
meant
taking
me
up
as
they
call
it
oh
do
not
be
too
buoyed
up
papa
she
murmured
in
an
agony
of
shame
and
remorse
if
it
should
not
be
so
if
there
should
be
some
mistake
oh
if
you
had
let
me
come
alone
mistake
what
can
you
mean
leslie
he
responded
almost
angrily
there
is
no
mistake
can
be
none
anyone
would
think
you
doubted
my
my
ability
my
artistic
capacity
hush
hush
she
whispered
for
he
had
raised
his
voice
unconsciously
and
she
heard
footsteps
approaching
the
next
moment
the
door
in
the
partition
opened
and
a
short
stout
man
with
closely
cropped
hair
of
silvery
white
and
small
shrewd
eyes
entered
the
room
or
gallery
he
bowed
and
looked
at
them
keenly
and
it
seemed
to
leslie
that
his
glance
rested
longer
upon
her
than
on
her
father
mr
lisle
he
said
francis
lisle
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
in
a
stately
kind
of
way
as
if
he
were
peter
paul
rubens
receiving
a
deputation
that
is
my
name
sir
he
said
with
a
kind
of
kingly
affability
and
i
am
here
in
obedience
to
your
summons
chapter
xxiv
mad
as
a
hatter
arnheim
looked
rather
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
as
if
he
remembered
oh
yes
yes
lisle
he
said
with
a
slightly
foreign
accent
he
was
german
i
remember
you
sent
for
me
doubtless
to
make
arrangements
for
the
inclusion
of
some
of
my
pictures
in
your
coming
exhibition
said
francis
lisle
in
a
nervously
pompous
voice
which
quivered
with
suppressed
excitement
and
importance
not
exact
began
arnheim
but
he
happened
to
glance
at
leslie
and
something
in
her
pale
wan
face
stopped
him
he
was
a
shrewd
man
and
the
anxiety
of
the
daughter
of
the
half
pompous
half
frightened
creature
before
him
touched
him
possibly
possibly
er
lisle
he
said
but
my
reason
for
communicating
with
you
was
the
fact
that
i
had
been
requested
by
he
was
going
to
say
lord
auchester
but
he
glanced
at
leslie
face
again
and
seeing
the
imploring
expression
on
it
faltered
a
moment
then
went
on
suavely
by
a
valued
client
of
mine
to
procure
a
work
by
your
hand
francis
lisle
face
fell
for
a
moment
then
it
brightened
again
a
commission
he
said
yes
yes
may
i
ask
the
name
of
your
client
arnheim
opened
his
lips
to
give
the
name
but
once
again
met
the
imploring
gaze
of
the
sweet
eyes
and
kept
the
name
back
it
is
not
usual
to
give
our
clients
names
lisle
he
said
with
an
affectation
of
shrewdness
we
dealers
are
business
men
pure
and
simple
and
are
never
too
ready
with
information
that
may
injure
us
i
hope
you
will
consider
it
sufficient
that
a
gentleman
has
made
inquiries
after
some
work
of
yours
and
er
be
prepared
to
come
to
terms
with
me
of
course
i
only
act
as
the
agent
francis
lisle
flushed
and
bit
his
lip
but
a
gratified
smile
was
creeping
over
his
thin
wan
face
i
understand
arnheim
he
said
pompously
i
am
very
busy
just
at
present
indeed
i
have
only
just
finished
a
picture
for
er
a
patron
for
which
i
have
received
a
fairly
large
sum
and
i
have
a
number
of
studies
in
hand
but
er
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
shall
be
willing
to
paint
a
picture
for
you
or
your
unknown
client
if
you
prefer
to
put
it
in
that
way
but
i
can
only
do
so
on
one
condition
mr
arnheim
the
dealer
bowed
and
what
is
that
condition
mr
lisle
he
asked
gravely
that
your
client
permit
any
picture
he
may
purchase
of
me
to
be
exhibited
at
the
royal
academy
exhibition
certainly
certainly
i
undertake
that
he
shall
accord
that
permission
said
arnheim
very
good
said
francis
lisle
and
now
i
should
like
to
show
you
some
of
my
pictures
we
have
brought
a
few
the
best
in
my
judgment
but
there
are
several
others
if
you
would
like
to
see
more
leslie
leslie
rose
and
took
up
a
couple
of
the
canvases
and
as
she
did
she
looked
at
the
keen
shrewd
face
of
the
dealer
it
was
the
look
with
which
she
had
appealed
to
temple
and
it
said
as
plainly
as
if
she
had
spoken
spare
him
oh
spare
him
francis
lisle
took
one
of
the
pictures
from
her
hand
and
nervously
excitedly
placed
it
on
an
empty
easel
which
stood
ready
for
the
purpose
a
seascape
arnheim
he
said
waving
his
hand
it
would
savor
of
impertinence
to
point
out
its
merits
to
you
who
are
so
experienced
and
able
a
critic
but
i
may
venture
to
hint
that
there
is
something
in
the
treatment
of
that
sky
which
you
will
not
meet
with
every
day
for
a
moment
the
eminent
dealer
face
expressed
a
wide
gaping
astonishment
then
it
seemed
to
writhe
as
if
with
the
effort
to
suppress
a
burst
of
laughter
but
lastly
it
turned
to
an
impassive
mask
and
carefully
avoiding
the
anguish
in
leslie
eyes
he
said
shading
the
view
with
his
hand
remarkable
very
very
remarkable
mr
lisle
i
thought
you
would
say
so
said
francis
lisle
with
a
triumphant
glance
at
leslie
who
had
stood
with
downcast
eyes
but
if
you
think
that
worthy
of
notice
what
do
you
say
to
this
and
he
replaced
the
canvas
by
another
of
cliffs
by
moonlight
remark
the
shadows
the
foam
on
the
rocks
the
birds
mr
arnheim
yes
yes
yes
said
arnheim
in
a
kind
of
still
voice
most
most
singular
and
admirable
he
glanced
at
leslie
and
an
expression
of
pity
and
sympathy
came
into
his
shrewd
face
and
here
is
another
said
francis
lisle
catching
up
a
third
picture
wreck
i
spent
months
months
arnheim
over
this
and
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
i
consider
it
one
of
my
masterpieces
and
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
fearful
daub
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
arnheim
stood
speechless
with
what
the
unfortunate
painter
took
to
be
admiration
and
leslie
trembling
and
pale
came
forward
and
took
the
canvas
from
the
easel
we
we
must
not
take
up
any
more
of
arnheim
time
papa
she
faltered
with
an
appealing
glance
at
the
dealer
no
no
certainly
not
responded
lisle
but
it
is
only
right
that
mr
arnheim
should
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
of
my
work
you
may
be
surprised
sir
that
i
am
still
so
to
speak
an
unknown
artist
i
may
say
that
that
surprise
is
shared
by
myself
but
no
one
can
be
better
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
fame
and
fortune
do
not
always
fall
to
the
deserving
no
art
is
a
lottery
and
the
best
of
us
may
and
alas
too
often
do
only
draw
blanks
but
i
am
confident
that
now
you
who
have
so
many
opportunities
of
directing
the
attention
of
the
world
to
what
is
most
worthy
of
notice
in
art
have
become
acquainted
with
my
pictures
that
that
in
short
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
looked
round
confusedly
yes
yes
said
arnheim
soothingly
i
quite
understand
you
will
hear
from
me
i
will
see
my
client
yes
certainly
cut
in
francis
lisle
i
i
leave
the
whole
of
the
negotiations
to
you
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
you
mr
arnheim
arnheim
bowed
and
assisted
leslie
trembling
hands
to
repack
the
pictures
but
the
artist
stopped
them
by
a
gesture
wait
wait
leslie
i
am
content
to
leave
these
works
with
arnheim
he
will
like
to
place
them
in
this
gallery
with
his
other
masterpieces
the
expression
on
arnheim
face
at
this
proposition
beggars
description
but
he
mastered
his
emotion
and
managed
to
bow
and
mumble
out
some
unintelligible
words
which
francis
lisle
mistook
for
expressions
of
gratitude
do
not
mention
it
my
dear
sir
he
said
waving
his
hand
i
commit
them
to
your
care
with
every
confidence
assured
that
they
will
receive
every
consideration
and
appreciation
from
you
come
leslie
as
you
said
we
must
not
take
up
too
much
of
arnheim
time
good
morning
sir
i
leave
you
to
conduct
all
negotiations
with
your
client
i
have
every
confidence
in
you
good
morning
he
gave
his
hand
to
arnheim
with
the
air
of
a
and
with
a
glance
round
the
room
as
if
he
already
saw
his
pictures
placed
among
the
other
gems
stalked
nervously
out
leslie
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
held
out
her
hand
for
a
moment
she
seemed
incapable
of
speech
then
her
trembling
lips
parted
and
she
faltered
you
have
been
very
good
and
and
patient
and
forbearing
sir
and
i
am
grateful
very
grateful
do
mention
it
miss
lisle
he
said
touched
by
her
loveliness
and
sadness
i
quite
understand
that
is
well
i
ca
quite
understand
leslie
face
burnt
like
fire
why
his
his
grace
she
faltered
arnheim
looked
puzzled
his
lordship
he
corrected
her
but
leslie
was
too
agitated
to
notice
the
correction
i
can
not
explain
she
said
in
a
troubled
voice
but
you
will
see
him
yes
certainly
assented
arnheim
will
you
tell
him
please
her
voice
broke
and
her
hands
clasped
and
unclasped
will
you
tell
him
that
i
came
here
against
my
will
that
i
was
obliged
to
come
and
that
that
i
wish
him
to
forget
everything
that
has
passed
that
neither
my
father
nor
i
wish
to
see
him
again
that
we
wish
to
pass
out
of
his
life
as
if
we
had
never
seen
never
known
him
will
you
tell
him
this
you
you
think
it
strange
unbecoming
that
i
should
give
you
this
message
arnheim
but
her
voice
broke
but
perhaps
you
have
a
daughter
of
your
own
and
and
thinking
of
her
you
will
not
refuse
she
broke
down
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
arnheim
had
a
daughter
as
it
happened
and
he
did
think
of
her
i
do
understand
quite
miss
lisle
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
i
understand
enough
to
convey
your
message
leslie
gave
him
her
hand
without
another
word
and
hurried
after
her
father
she
found
him
descending
the
stairs
slowly
and
he
stopped
as
she
reached
him
and
nodded
at
her
one
moment
leslie
he
said
in
nervous
accents
i
forgot
to
ask
arnheim
if
his
gallery
is
insured
such
works
as
i
have
left
with
him
are
are
priceless
before
she
could
stop
him
he
had
turned
and
reascended
the
stairs
and
the
gallery
leslie
followed
him
the
gallery
was
empty
but
voices
were
heard
behind
the
partition
and
arnheim
could
be
heard
exclaiming
in
mingled
indignation
pity
and
amusement
the
man
is
as
mad
as
a
hatter
leslie
laid
her
hand
upon
her
father
arm
come
away
dear
she
implored
but
he
shook
her
hand
off
and
put
his
finger
to
his
lip
warningly
hush
be
silent
i
want
to
hear
what
he
is
saying
these
men
never
express
themselves
fully
about
the
pictures
in
the
presence
of
the
artists
now
listen
and
you
will
hear
what
he
really
thinks
hush
it
is
quite
fair
quite
and
he
chuckled
confidently
leslie
turned
to
stone
with
apprehension
and
dread
stood
still
and
waited
mad
as
a
hatter
continued
arnheim
to
some
one
behind
the
partition
the
pictures
he
raves
about
are
simply
daubs
the
daubs
of
a
lunatic
who
has
had
access
to
paint
and
brushes
look
at
this
he
called
it
a
seascape
look
at
it
why
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
would
blush
to
have
painted
it
in
fact
no
human
being
in
possession
of
his
senses
could
have
produced
it
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
i
never
did
and
i
had
some
queer
experiences
in
the
course
of
business
if
it
had
been
for
that
sweet
creature
his
daughter
i
should
have
burst
out
laughing
but
something
dash
me
if
i
know
what
kept
me
quiet
look
here
it
a
dashed
shame
that
what
it
is
he
told
me
to
write
for
the
man
and
i
thought
it
was
all
on
the
square
but
it
my
opinion
he
got
some
game
in
hand
with
the
daughter
i
might
have
guessed
that
seeing
the
sort
of
man
he
is
these
swells
are
all
alike
yes
it
a
dashed
shame
she
too
good
to
be
made
a
fool
of
and
deceived
but
did
you
ever
see
such
an
awful
lunatic
daub
as
this
and
this
and
this
the
speaker
voice
rose
in
crescendo
as
he
evidently
showed
each
of
francis
lisle
pictures
there
was
never
anything
like
out
of
a
madhouse
the
voice
ceased
for
lack
of
breath
and
leslie
turned
to
her
father
he
was
leaning
against
the
wall
his
face
white
livid
his
jaw
dropped
his
eyes
staring
vacantly
father
father
she
cried
in
a
low
voice
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
but
his
lips
moved
and
she
could
hear
a
faint
horrible
echo
of
the
words
that
had
been
spoken
behind
the
screen
come
away
dear
she
implored
him
come
away
he
dropped
his
eyes
to
her
face
and
tried
to
smile
but
it
was
a
hideous
grimace
yes
yes
he
said
hoarsely
almost
inarticulately
let
us
go
home
let
us
she
took
his
hand
drew
his
arm
through
hers
and
led
him
down
the
stairs
he
went
with
the
docility
the
helplessness
of
a
child
and
sank
into
a
corner
of
the
cab
with
his
eyes
dull
and
lifeless
but
his
lips
still
moving
presently
he
beckoned
to
her
what
what
did
he
say
he
asked
tremulously
his
face
working
it
it
does
not
matter
what
he
said
dear
she
said
soothingly
do
not
think
of
it
try
to
forget
it
lean
against
me
dear
but
he
put
her
from
him
not
with
his
old
impatient
irritability
but
with
a
gentleness
that
was
quite
new
with
him
and
lying
back
in
the
cab
stared
at
the
floor
his
lips
moving
and
leslie
could
hear
him
still
repeating
the
words
they
had
heard
from
arnheim
it
seemed
an
age
before
the
cab
reached
torrington
square
and
when
it
did
so
the
man
leslie
helped
out
was
an
older
man
by
twenty
years
than
he
who
had
left
it
that
morning
she
helped
him
up
to
his
room
and
tried
to
cheer
and
comfort
him
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
her
loving
flattery
proved
of
no
avail
he
listened
with
vacant
eyes
and
wan
hopeless
face
and
at
last
he
suddenly
flung
his
hands
before
his
eyes
and
uttered
a
low
cry
of
despair
and
awakening
god
help
me
he
cried
i
am
a
fraud
and
a
lie
i
see
it
all
now
a
fraud
and
a
lie
the
man
was
right
i
can
not
paint
he
caught
up
a
canvas
that
lay
against
the
wall
and
gazed
at
it
it
is
a
hideous
daub
as
he
said
it
is
the
work
of
a
madman
i
have
been
mad
oh
god
if
i
could
have
remained
so
my
dear
my
dear
she
murmured
kneeling
beside
him
and
gently
drawing
the
picture
from
his
weak
trembling
hands
do
think
of
what
what
he
said
not
think
of
it
he
cried
shaking
with
emotion
i
must
think
of
it
for
he
spoke
the
truth
i
have
been
mad
mad
but
my
eyes
are
open
now
take
them
away
from
me
he
motioned
to
the
pictures
take
them
away
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
them
and
and
yet
i
have
been
so
happy
so
hopeful
and
he
hid
his
face
with
his
hands
leslie
watched
beside
him
till
he
fell
into
a
deep
deathlike
sleep
then
she
stole
downstairs
and
sent
for
a
doctor
a
young
man
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
squares
came
and
though
he
was
young
he
was
not
foolish
a
glance
at
the
sleeping
man
told
him
the
sad
truth
have
you
has
your
father
any
relations
any
friends
who
whom
he
would
like
to
see
he
asked
gently
leslie
kneeling
beside
the
bed
looked
up
at
him
with
sharp
and
sudden
dread
in
her
eyes
do
you
do
you
mean
oh
what
is
it
you
mean
she
moaned
the
doctor
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
the
truth
is
always
best
always
he
said
gently
your
father
has
suffered
a
severe
shock
the
heart
he
stopped
for
his
sake
try
and
be
calm
my
dear
young
lady
leslie
knelt
beside
him
all
through
the
night
and
all
through
the
long
hours
her
conscience
whispered
accusingly
it
is
you
you
who
have
done
it
but
for
you
he
would
have
gone
on
dreaming
and
living
but
for
you
and
yorke
toward
dawn
francis
lisle
awoke
the
doctor
was
standing
beside
the
bed
leslie
on
her
knees
he
raised
his
wan
wasted
face
from
the
pillow
and
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
then
his
eyes
rested
on
her
anguished
ones
and
he
knew
her
and
forced
a
smile
is
is
that
you
leslie
he
said
in
so
low
a
voice
that
she
had
to
lay
her
face
against
his
to
hear
him
is
that
you
i
have
had
a
singular
dream
most
singular
what
what
was
it
dear
she
said
at
last
he
smiled
again
i
dreamt
that
my
picture
had
been
refused
by
the
academy
absurd
was
it
fancy
them
refusing
one
of
my
pictures
mine
francis
lisle
ridiculous
as
it
is
it
it
upset
me
i
i
must
be
out
of
sorts
there
is
only
one
thing
for
that
kind
of
complaint
work
get
get
a
fresh
canvas
stretched
for
me
leslie
and
i
will
commence
a
new
picture
let
me
see
what
did
we
get
for
the
last
three
thousand
pounds
was
it
yes
yes
dear
she
murmured
a
large
sum
a
large
sum
but
not
half
what
we
shall
get
fame
fame
and
fortune
at
last
leslie
i
always
told
you
it
would
come
he
put
out
his
wasted
hand
and
smoothed
her
hair
lovingly
and
alas
patronizingly
always
knew
it
would
come
leslie
art
is
long
and
and
life
is
brief
i
must
work
hard
now
fame
and
success
have
brought
me
the
victor
laurels
how
dark
it
is
the
sunlight
was
streaming
through
the
window
how
dark
too
dark
to
commence
but
leslie
dear
his
voice
grew
fainter
and
ceased
the
doctor
bent
over
him
then
stood
upright
and
laid
his
hand
upon
leslie
shoulder
with
a
touch
that
told
her
all
francis
lisle
had
gone
to
the
land
where
and
are
swallowed
up
in
eternity
chapter
xxv
forgotten
me
has
he
if
ever
a
man
was
in
earnest
yorke
viscount
auchester
was
he
was
going
to
marry
leslie
the
thought
dwelt
with
him
all
the
way
up
to
town
hovered
about
him
as
he
lay
awake
throughout
nearly
the
whole
night
and
came
to
him
in
the
morning
with
a
joy
exceeding
description
to
marry
leslie
what
had
he
done
to
deserve
such
happiness
such
bliss
he
asked
himself
as
he
hurried
through
his
tub
and
dressing
and
while
he
ate
his
breakfast
in
a
feverish
restless
kind
of
haste
he
pictured
and
planned
out
their
future
a
future
to
be
spent
side
by
side
till
death
and
death
alone
parted
them
they
would
leave
london
immediately
after
the
marriage
and
cross
the
channel
perhaps
they
stay
for
a
while
in
paris
but
only
for
a
few
days
it
would
be
too
big
and
noisy
for
such
bliss
as
theirs
no
he
would
take
her
to
some
quiet
spot
in
normandy
perhaps
to
rouen
that
delightful
town
with
its
magnificent
churches
and
historic
streets
why
he
could
see
themselves
standing
arm
in
arm
in
the
vast
cathedral
listening
reverently
to
the
grand
service
he
could
see
leslie
face
with
the
sweet
gravity
in
her
lovely
eyes
and
the
half
pensive
and
yet
happy
smile
on
her
pure
lips
he
fancied
her
by
his
side
looking
up
at
the
carved
gables
of
the
quaint
houses
or
seated
at
one
of
the
little
marble
tables
at
the
cafe
blanc
with
its
shining
copper
vessels
and
glittering
glass
then
they
could
go
on
into
germany
up
the
rhine
how
delightful
to
have
her
beside
him
as
the
steamer
toiled
against
the
stream
and
the
delicious
panorama
unfolded
itself
mile
by
mile
then
if
they
chose
there
were
switzerland
and
italy
there
was
lucerne
for
instance
how
she
would
delight
in
lucerne
with
its
marvelous
lake
in
which
old
pilatus
shadows
himself
with
its
famous
bridge
spanning
the
emerald
reuss
with
its
snug
cathedral
in
which
the
wonderful
organ
surges
and
wails
as
no
other
organ
can
surge
and
wail
save
that
of
honored
milan
happy
he
would
make
her
happy
or
know
the
reason
why
he
would
devote
every
hour
of
his
life
every
particle
of
his
by
no
means
gigantic
intellect
to
the
effort
to
prove
how
dearly
he
loved
her
he
sat
for
a
little
while
after
breakfast
making
a
mental
plan
of
his
procedure
he
would
have
to
act
prudently
and
warily
no
hint
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
must
be
allowed
to
get
out
if
his
numerous
creditors

and
gentile
had
the
least
suspicion
that
he
was
about
to
marry
a
penniless
angel
instead
of
lady
eleanor
dallas
the
heiress
they
would
swoop
down
upon
him
no
he
would
be
very
cautious
he
had
gone
round
to
arnheim
the
dealer
on
the
evening
before
immediately
he
had
reached
london
and
was
very
cautious
with
him
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
merely
wanted
a
small
picture
of
lisle
and
asking
arnheim
in
quite
a
casual
way
to
write
and
ask
lisle
whether
he
would
accept
a
commission
do
mention
my
name
please
he
said
and
arnheim
had
smiled
and
shaken
his
head
yorke
went
away
quite
confident
that
the
vaguest
of
letters
from
the
great
dealer
would
bring
francis
lisle
post
haste
to
london
and
as
we
know
he
was
right
then
he
went
down
to
doctors
commons
and
inquired
about
the
license
he
knew
no
more
about
the
business
than
the
veriest
schoolboy
but
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
you
could
buy
a
license
somewhere
in
that
strange
locality
and
that
armed
with
that
he
could
marry
leslie
right
away
at
once
at
once
the
thought
sent
the
blood
rushing
to
his
handsome
face
and
made
paul
cathedral
hard
by
which
is
doctors
commons
waver
before
his
eyes
a
gentleman
led
him
to
the
faculty
office
where
the
mystic
license
was
to
be
obtained
and
a
grave
and
sedate
clerk
got
off
a
high
stool
at
a
desk
and
put
several
questions
to
yorke
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
or
the
second
perhaps
for
he
was
nervous
when
he
had
asked
leslie
to
be
his
wife
felt
embarrassed
and
agitated
is
it
an
ordinary
license
you
require
or
a
special
asked
the
clerk
yorke
looked
doubtful
what
is
the
difference
he
asked
almost
shyly
and
struggling
with
an
actual
blush
the
clerk
eyed
him
with
cold
superiority
by
an
ordinary
license
he
explained
you
can
marry
in
the
church
of
the
parish
in
which
one
of
the
parties
resides
and
only
there
and
he
or
she
must
have
resided
there
fifteen
days
with
a
special
license
you
can
marry
in
a
particular
church
without
having
resided
in
the
parish
fifteen
days
but
you
would
have
to
give
sufficient
reasons
for
requiring
this
special
license
yorke
stared
at
the
dingy
floor
while
he
thought
the
matter
out
he
knew
of
a
quiet
little
church
near
bury
street
a
little
church
around
the
corner
so
to
speak
to
which
he
and
leslie
could
go
the
morning
after
her
arrival
in
london
and
with
no
one
but
the
parson
the
clerk
and
the
wiser
yes
an
ordinary
license
would
do
he
said
the
clerk
inclined
his
head
just
as
if
he
were
a
shopman
selling
gloves
and
went
off
to
another
clerk
at
another
desk
and
presently
appeared
with
an
affidavit
what
this
the
license
said
yorke
no
you
will
have
to
swear
this
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
next
office
to
a
solicitor
you
have
to
swear
that
the
parties
are
of
age
and
that
one
of
you
has
resided
in
the
parish
fifteen
days
you
are
prepared
to
do
so
i
presume
it
is
to
be
feared
that
yorke
was
prepared
to
do
anything
to
obtain
his
leslie
and
he
was
led
off
he
felt
like
a
criminal
of
the
deepest
dye
to
another
dingy
office
and
there
repeated
the
oath
gabbled
out
by
the
solicitor
then
he
returned
to
the
proctor
office
and
after
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
clerk
handed
him
a
document
what
have
i
got
to
pay
asked
yorke
prepared
for
a
demand
say
of
fifty
pounds
only
two
pounds
two
and
sixpence
he
said
with
a
surprise
that
made
even
that
solemn
clerk
smile
only
two
pounds
two
and
sixpence
for
the
privilege
of
marrying
leslie
he
stood
and
gazed
at
the
mystic
document
and
laughed
aloud
so
that
the
seedy
man
who
had
conducted
him
to
the
office
eyed
him
rather
fearfully
and
pocketing
the
yorke
gave
him
scrambled
off
fully
convinced
that
the
young
man
was
mad
and
indeed
he
could
scarcely
be
considered
in
full
possession
of
his
senses
that
day
nearly
every
hour
he
took
out
that
precious
license
and
read
it
through
or
gazed
at
the
imposing
coat
of
arms
at
the
top
and
the
archbishop
signature
at
the
bottom
and
every
time
put
it
away
again
in
his
breast
coat
pocket
he
patted
the
coat
to
feel
that
the
document
was
there
safe
and
sound
from
doctors
commons
he
walked
to
the
dorchester
club
everybody
knows
that
aristocratic
institution
it
is
not
so
magnificent
as
some
of
the
modern
political
clubs
some
of
them
are
palaces
compared
with
which
those
of
the
caesars
were
very
small
potatoes
it
had
no
marble
entrance
hall
and
and
its
was
not
as
vast
as
a
church
but
it
was
snug
and
comfortable
and
excellent
to
a
degree
you
had
to
have
your
name
down
on
the
list
of
candidates
full
fifteen
or
twenty
years
before
you
could
hope
to
be
balloted
in
and
some
fathers
put
their
sons
down
when
they
were
eighteen
months
old
yorke
was
well
known
at
the
club
and
the
hall
porter
in
his
glass
box
bowed
to
him
with
a
mixture
of
respect
and
recognition
which
he
accorded
to
a
very
few
of
the
members
there
are
no
letters
for
me
stephens
i
suppose
said
yorke
no
my
lord
none
ah
well
i
expect
one
or
a
telegram
directly
said
yorke
trying
to
speak
casually
if
it
comes
just
send
into
the
or
or
in
fact
and
see
if
i
in
the
club
i
want
it
directly
it
comes
you
understand
certainly
my
lord
was
the
response
if
your
lordship
is
in
the
club
when
the
letter
arrives
i
will
see
that
you
have
it
at
once
yorke
sauntered
into
the
and
took
up
a
paper
but
he
did
not
see
a
word
of
the
page
he
gazed
at
he
was
calculating
how
soon
that
letter
could
possibly
reach
him
then
he
went
out
and
making
his
way
to
regent
street
examined
the
shop
windows
carefully
and
ultimately
made
several
purchases
he
bought
a
lady
ulster
a
wonderful
garment
of
camel
hair
soft
as
lambs
wool
and
as
warm
with
cuffs
that
could
be
let
down
over
the
hands
and
a
hood
that
could
be
drawn
completely
over
the
head
no
lady
with
this
marvelous
ulster
on
could
be
cold
even
while
crossing
the
channel
where
as
everybody
knows
it
is
possible
to
be
frozen
even
on
a
summer
night
he
also
bought
a
traveling
rug
of
scotch
tweed
then
he
sauntered
into
the
park
till
lunch
time
when
he
went
back
to
the
club
he
knew
that
no
letter
could
be
waiting
for
him
and
yet
he
could
not
help
glancing
inquiringly
at
the
porter
who
faintly
smiled
and
respectively
shook
his
head
one
or
two
acquaintances
dropped
in
while
he
was
eating
his
lunch
at
a
side
table
and
they
gathered
round
him
and
plied
him
with
eager
invitations
to
join
them
in
a
driving
trip
to
richmond
but
he
shook
his
head
better
come
auchester
said
one
young
fellow
jolly
afternoon
besides
a
friend
of
yours
is
of
the
party
who
is
that
asked
yorke
with
polite
indifference
drive
to
richmond
when
he
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
of
leslie
and
all
that
license
in
his
breast
coat
pocket
meant
not
likely
why
finetta
said
the
young
fellow
she
has
promised
if
we
get
her
back
in
time
for
the
theater
yorke
shook
his
head
and
while
he
was
doing
it
lord
vinson
strolled
up
what
that
about
finetta
and
richmond
he
inquired
afraid
be
disappointed
just
been
up
there
he
drawled
she
vamoosed
the
ranche
sloped
off
somewhere
and
is
going
to
dance
know
where
she
gone
auchester
no
said
yorke
and
he
answered
very
quietly
poor
fin
was
she
taking
the
breaking
off
of
their
friendship
to
heart
after
all
strikes
me
mademoiselle
fin
is
playing
it
rather
low
on
an
indulgent
public
grumbled
the
young
fellow
who
had
arranged
the
outing
and
as
he
sauntered
off
with
the
rest
he
remarked
in
a
low
voice
be
surprised
if
auchester
had
arranged
to
take
her
somewhere
awfully
thick
you
know
and
she
throw
over
anything
for
him
after
lunch
yorke
went
to
bury
street
and
with
his
own
hands
packed
a
portmanteau
or
two
then
he
went
back
to
the
club
for
though
he
knew
no
telegram
could
have
arrived
he
felt
constrained
to
be
there
in
waiting
so
to
speak
and
dined
quietly
and
in
solitude
and
afterwards
he
walked
by
the
park
railings
to
notting
hill
and
round
the
quiet
squares
and
was
happy
thinking
of
leslie
and
the
days
that
lay
before
them
the
delicious
glorious
days
when
they
two
should
be
one
man
and
wife
man
and
wife
he
went
to
bed
early
that
night
and
slept
soundly
so
soundly
that
he
was
rather
later
than
he
meant
to
be
at
breakfast
and
he
hurried
over
that
meal
and
made
his
way
to
the
dorchester
with
a
heart
there
might
possibly
be
a
telegram
for
him
but
the
porter
said
no
nothing
had
come
for
his
lordship
and
yorke
too
disappointed
to
make
a
pretense
of
looking
at
the
papers
went
out
and
stood
on
the
broad
steps
and
stared
up
and
down
pall
mall
arnheim
had
promised
to
wire
the
night
yorke
had
seen
him
there
had
been
time
for
the
lisles
to
get
up
to
london
time
for
leslie
to
wire
well
he
would
be
patient
and
not
worry
but
heaven
and
earth
what
should
he
do
with
himself
while
he
was
waiting
for
that
telegram
he
was
so
wrapped
up
in
the
thought
of
meeting
his
darling
that
he
could
not
endure
the
distraction
of
even
exchanging
greetings
with
his
acquaintances
he
could
not
go
to
finetta
never
again
or
lady
eleanor
he
wanted
to
be
alone
alone
with
his
thoughts
what
should
he
do
was
there
anything
else
he
could
buy
as
the
question
crossed
his
mind
the
answer
flashed
upon
him
and
made
him
almost
start
why
there
was
the
ring
he
had
not
bought
that
yet
what
an
idiot
he
was
even
with
a
license
you
could
not
be
married
without
a
ring
he
went
straight
off
to
bond
street
to
the
jeweler
of
whom
he
had
purchased
the
diamond
pendant
and
the
plain
gold
locket
and
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
outside
looking
at
the
things
in
the
window
he
would
have
a
keeper
as
well
as
a
plain
wedding
ring
he
would
get
the
prettiest
and
they
got
he
gazed
at
the
rows
of
diamond
ornaments
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
covetously
ah
if
he
were
only
the
duke
of
rothbury
as
she
thought
him
what
things
he
would
buy
for
her
notwithstanding
that
if
he
were
the
duke
he
would
have
the
great
rothbury
diamonds
those
gems
which
were
supposed
to
rank
next
to
the
crown
jewels
and
they
would
be
hers
his
duchess
yet
all
the
same
he
would
buy
her
all
sorts
of
pretty
things
as
the
heathen
loves
to
deck
his
idol
so
he
yorke
would
love
to
deck
his
idol
with
all
that
this
world
counted
good
and
precious
regarding
that
masquerade
of
his
that
sailing
under
false
colors
he
thought
that
leslie
would
neither
be
very
disappointed
nor
angry
it
is
me
she
loves
he
told
himself
with
a
proudly
swelling
heart
and
it
will
not
matter
what
i
am
or
am
not
but
all
the
same
i
wish
that
idea
had
not
occurred
to
poor
old
dolph
all
this
was
passing
through
his
mind
as
he
was
standing
outside
the
shop
in
bond
street
everybody
knows
it
and
everybody
knows
that
the
street
is
rather
narrow
just
where
the
shop
is
situated
and
at
that
moment
it
happened
that
one
of
the
many
blocks
of
the
day
occurred
and
that
a
neatly
appointed
brougham
was
brought
to
a
standstill
very
nearly
opposite
the
jeweler
shop
it
was
a
charming
little
brougham
one
of
those
costly
toys
which
only
very
wealthy
people
can
indulge
in
the
interior
was
lined
with
russian
leather
the
cushions
of
sage
plush
there
was
a
clock
in
ormolu
and
turquoise
and
a
delightful
little
reading
lamp
fan
and
scent
case
and
china
basket
it
was
the
brougham
which
took
the
celebrated
finetta
to
and
from
the
diadem
the
brougham
of
which
the
newspapers
have
given
an
elaborate
account
and
in
it
was
no
less
a
personage
than
finetta
herself
she
was
leaning
back
against
the
eiderdown
cushions
her
handsome
face
pale
with
purplish
rings
round
her
dark
eyes
she
looked
as
if
she
was
half
worn
out
by
excitement
and
physical
fatigue
she
had
been
lying
with
closed
eyes
till
the
block
and
stoppage
came
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
asked
listlessly
what
is
it
it
a
block
said
polly
who
sat
beside
her
there
a
carriage
and
a
butcher
cart
in
front
a
swell
carriage
finetta
leant
forward
listlessly
then
her
listlessness
changed
fled
rather
it
it
lady
eleanor
dallas
she
said
between
her
teeth
oh
said
polly
is
it
well
i
wish
they
get
on
and
oh
the
exclamation
escaped
her
lips
unawares
and
finetta
following
the
direction
of
polly
eyes
saw
yorke
standing
gazing
in
at
the
shop
window
she
uttered
a
faint
cry
and
fell
back
clutching
polly
arm
it
him
she
breathed
lord
auchester
i
know
it
is
said
the
polly
well

need
start
as
if
you
got
the
jumps
what
is
he
doing
there

is
he
going
to
buy
said
finetta
in
a
low
and
agitated
voice
polly
jerked
down
the
blind
do
make
a
perfect
fool
of
yourself
fin
she
ventured
to
remonstrate

to

guess

finetta
her
eyes
still
fixed
through
a
chink
beside
the
silk
blind
on
yorke

hold
my
tongue
but

she
ventured
on
a
short
laugh
finetta

on
her

what
did
he
send
me
his
portrait
in
a
locket
and
that
letter
for

you
hold
your
tongue
tell
the
man
to
drive
to
piccadilly
and
then
back
again
her
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
shining
with
feverish
light
in
their
purple
rings
well
if
anyone
had
told
me
that
you
you
fin
would

such
a
fool

coachman

said
in
a
low
voice
you

understand
and
more
you
never
will
is
there
any
one
in
the
carriage
opposite
is
is
lady
eleanor
in
it
chapter
xxvi
a
wedding
ring
polly
peered
out
i
ca
see
she
said
the
blinds
are
down
but
though
she
could
not
see
her
lady
eleanor
was
in
the
carriage
and
she
was
looking
as
finetta
was
at
the
stalwart
young
man
in
front
of
the
jeweler
window
and
her
face
was
quite
as
pale
as
finetta
should
she
open
the
window
and
call
him
she
longed
to
do
so
and
yet
something
some
vague
presentiment
kept
her
from
doing
so
she
watched
him
her
heart
beating
with
love
until
the
block
had
melted
away
and
the
carriage
had
moved
on
then
she
pulled
the
check
string
and
when
the
footman
got
down
said
drive
to
oxford
street
and
then
come
back
here
please
meanwhile
all
unconscious
that
these
two
women
were
watching
him
yorke
went
into
the
shop
i
want
to
look
at
some
rings
he
said
to
the
man
who
bowed
to
him
with
an
air
of
respectful
recognition
it
happened
to
be
the
same
man
who
had
served
him
the
other
day
fancy
rings
my
lord
no
no
said
yorke
trying
to
speak
in
the
most
ordinary
and
casual
way
and
feeling
very
much
as
he
had
felt
while
procuring
the
license
er
wedding
and
keeper
rings
certainly
my
lord
said
the
man
without
the
faintest
change
of
countenance
and
he
placed
a
couple
of
trays
on
the
counter
what
size
my
lord
yorke
looked
up
with
a
start
of
perplexity
size
he
repeated
vaguely
as
he
mentally
called
himself
an
idiot
for
not
having
measured
leslie
finger
oh
a
small
size
i
do
quite
know
yes
quite
a
small
size
here
i
take
two
or
three
they
all
alike
i
suppose
some
heavier
than
the
others
my
lord
all
right
give
me
the
heaviest
and
the
keeper
is
that
what
called
yes
my
lord
it
keeps
the
wedding
ring
in
its
place
you
see
i
see
said
yorke
well
i
have
one
or
two
of
these
the
smaller
ones
put
this
one
in
and
he
picked
out
one
set
with
pearl
and
turquoise
i
send
back
those
i
do
keep
he
tried
to
slip
them
on
his
little
finger
but
they
would
not
go
farther
than
the
first
point
and
he
laid
them
down
with
a
smile
in
a
few
hours
perhaps
he
would
be
placing
them
on
his
darling
finger
his
wife
the
shopman
put
the
rings
in
a
box
and
yorke
stowed
them
away
carefully
very
carefully
in
an
inner
pocket
and
went
out
still
dreaming
of
the
hours
when
he
should
stand
before
the
altar
of
the
quiet
little
church
in
james
two
or
three
minutes
afterward
the
dainty
brougham
pulled
up
to
the
shop
door
and
finetta
entered
she
was
as
well
known
to
the
jeweler
as
was
lord
auchester
and
if
possible
he
made
her
a
more
respectful
and
elaborate
bow
she
was
a
good
customer
and
like
most
people
in
her
position
she
liked
a
great
show
of
respect
so
he
leaned
forward
and
placed
a
chair
for
her
and
with
another
bow
asked
what
he
could
have
the
honor
of
doing
for
her
finetta
large
dark
eyes
wandered
over
the
counter
with
a
feigned
indifference
and
listlessness
i
only
want
a
small
present
she
said
yes
madam
for
a
gentleman
and
he
made
for
a
tray
of
silver
cigarette
cases
and
similar
articles
finetta
looked
at
them
but
kept
the
corners
of
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
trays
which
had
been
on
the
glass
counter
when
she
entered
what
pretty
rings
she
said
taking
up
a
jeweled
keeper
they
almost
tempt
one
to
get
married
the
man
smiled
sympathetically
i
suppose
the
bridegroom
always
chooses
the
rings
she
said
with
seeming
carelessness
now
i
wonder
which
of
these
most
men
would
choose
the
man
fingered
the
rings
lightly
some
one
some
another
madam
he
replied
the
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
chose
one
like
this
finetta
face
was
pale
already
but
it
seemed
to
blanch
and
the
ring
rolled
along
the
counter
lord
auchester
was
buying
a
wedding
ring
and
keeper
she
said
involuntarily
as
the
words
left
her
lips
a
lady
had
entered
the
shop
and
she
heard
them
as
plainly
as
if
they
had
been
addressed
to
her
and
they
took
an
instantaneous
and
extraordinary
effect
she
let
the
door
slip
and
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
so
stood
gazing
with
a
strange
expression
in
her
eyes
from
finetta
to
the
man
it
was
a
dramatic
moment
the
two
women
stood
silent
and
motionless
regarding
each
other
with
a
world
of
meaning
in
their
eyes
finetta
still
eyeing
lady
eleanor
went
on
it
was
lord
auchester
who
bought
the
ring
the
jeweler
smiled
deprecatingly
well
as
you
saw
him
madam
it
is
no
breach
of
confidence
it
was
his
lordship
then
he
looked
toward
lady
eleanor
and
bowing
placed
a
chair
for
her
finetta
rose
her
face
was
still
white
her
full
lips
pale
and
trembling
i
i
will
come
in
again
she
said
and
moved
toward
the
door
then
she
stopped
and
swaying
forward
rather
than
stepping
leaned
toward
lady
eleanor
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
said
abruptly
and
hoarsely
lady
eleanor
shrank
back
and
eyed
her
haughtily
i
i
she
began
but
her
voice
seemed
to
fail
her
you
better
not
refuse
for
for
your
own
sake
said
finetta
hissed
it
rather
you
you
know
me
lady
eleanor
tried
to
look
a
denial
but
the
effort
failed
as
the
effort
to
speak
had
and
i
know
you
went
on
finetta
still
in
the
low
husky
agitated
voice
what
i
have
to
say
concerns
you
you
better
not
refuse
lady
eleanor
looked
round
as
if
seeking
some
means
of
escape
then
rose
hesitated
a
moment
her
white
teeth
catching
her
lip
and
followed
finetta
to
the
end
of
the
long
shop
the
jeweler
discreetly
keeping
out
of
earshot
and
respectfully
waiting
until
his
customers
had
finished
their
conference
he
saw
that
something
was
happening
but
his
face
was
absolutely
impassive
lady
eleanor
stood
turned
sideways
to
finetta
her
haughty
lips
half
lowered
but
her
lips
trembling
if
anyone
that
morning
had
told
her
that
finetta
of
the
diadem
would
dare
to
address
her
and
that
she
would
consent
to
listen
to
her
for
one
single
moment
she
would
have
laughed
the
idea
to
scorn
and
yet
here
she
was
actually
waiting
for
what
the
woman
had
to
say
finetta
bosom
was
heaving
with
the
effort
at
she
could
not
help
admiring
lady
eleanor
while
she
hated
her
and
she
tried
to
imitate
her
you
heard
what
the
man
said
she
said
at
last
in
a
low
shaken
voice
lady
eleanor
haughty
lids
moved
slightly
in
assent
well
said
finetta
with
a
kind
of
gasp
it
true
lady
eleanor
made
the
faintest
movement
with
her
hand
it
seemed
to
say
if
it
is
what
is
it
to
do
with
me
or
you
and
finetta
understood
her
a
hot
flush
passed
over
her
handsome
face
you
mean
it
no
business
of
mine
well
she
drew
a
long
breath
perhaps
it
is
but
it
is
of
yours
or
people
make
a
great
mistake
when
they
say
he
is
going
to
marry
you
lady
eleanor
face
crimsoned
with
humiliation
and
she
made
as
if
to
leave
the
place
at
once
but
finetta
put
out
her
hand
and
lady
eleanor
stepped
back
as
if
the
touch
would
contaminate
her
i
i
can
not
listen
to
you
i
have
nothing
to
say
she
said
in
a
labored
voice
you
have
no
right
to
speak
to
me
i
do
not
know
you
have
no
wish
finetta
teeth
came
together
with
a
click
very
well
go
then
she
exclaimed
vindictively
go
do
you
think
it
any
pleasure
to
me
to
speak
to
you
do
you
think
i
have
spoken
to
you
if
it
had
been
for
his
sake
lady
eleanor
winced
you
treat
me
like
the
dirt
under
your
feet
you
wo
stoop
to
listen
to
what
i
got
to
say
though
it
should
save
him
from
ruin
and
you
call
yourself
his
friend
a
pretty
friend
i
heard
you
swells
have
got
no
heart
and
i
should
think
it
true
judging
by
you
her
breath
came
fiercely
go
why
do
you
go
lady
eleanor
looked
at
the
door
and
then
at
the
white
working
face
and
flashing
eyes
and
remained
she
drew
her
light
wrap
round
her
and
held
it
with
a
clenched
hand
say
what
you
have
to
say
quickly
she
said
and
her
voice
was
thick
and
husky
you
are
right
i
am
a
friend
of
lord
auchester
if
it
is
he
whom
you
mean
finetta
eyed
her
with
a
touch
of
scorn
in
her
flashing
eyes
you
know
it
is
him
friend
i
should
think
you
were
do
you
think
i
did
see
you
start
when
you
came
in
and
do
you
think
i
do
see
how
you
trembling
and
shaking
bah
with
all
your
acting
you
would
be
worth
much
on
the
stage
i
tell
you
what
the
man
said
is
true
yorke
auchester
has
bought
his
wedding
ring
and
he
use
it
unless
you
can
prevent
it
lady
eleanor
face
was
like
a
mask
but
her
eyelids
quivered
i
done
my
best
or
worst
went
on
finetta
and
she
laughed
harshly
i
seen
the
girl
and
tried
to
put
a
spoke
in
her
wheel
and
i
thought
i
succeeded
but
it
seems
i
have
you
have
seen
her
escaped
lady
eleanor
lips
yes
said
finetta
did
you
think
it
was
me
he
was
going
to
marry
her
lips
twitched
it
a
young
girl
down
in
the
country
at
a
forsaken
place
called
portmaris
portmaris
lady
eleanor
breathed
yes
quite
a
young
girl
a
country
girl
a
mere
nobody
and
not
a
swell
like
you
though
she
what
you
call
a
lady
she
added
lady
eleanor
sank
into
a
chair
and
sat
with
tightly
clasped
hands
the
shock
of
this
sudden
news
had
caused
her
to
forget
that
the
woman
who
was
speaking
to
her
was
finetta
the
dancing
girl
at
the
diadem
the
girl
with
whom
yorke
auchester
had
been
so
intimately
friendly
finetta
looked
down
at
her
with
a
bitter
smile
she
had
brought
this
haughty
aristocrat
to
her
knees
at
any
rate
how
she
must
love
him
she
thought
how
we
both
love
him
and
she
ground
her
teeth
lady
eleanor
with
her
eyes
downcast
asked
after
a
pause
what
is
her
name
leslie
lisle
replied
finetta
she
as
pretty
and
and
fresh
as
as
a
flower
and
when
i
told
her
that
that
lady
eleanor
looked
up
what
did
you
tell
her
she
asked
in
a
low
husky
voice
finetta
flushed
sullenly
well
it
does
matter
i
thought
that
what
i
told
her
would
break
it
off
between
him
and
her
but
it
has
or
he
would
be
buying
the
wedding
ring
they
are
going
to
be
married
secretly
and
at
once
and
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
my
lady
lady
eleanor
looked
before
her
vacantly
her
heart
was
aching
burning
with
jealousy
and
the
terror
of
despair
she
shook
her
head
i
daresay
you
wonder
why
i
spoke
to
you
why
i
tell
you
this
seeing
that
it
ca
matter
to
me
who
he
marries
said
finetta
with
a
flush
lady
eleanor
glanced
at
her
yes
why
did
you
speak
to
me
she
said
indistinctly
finetta
bit
her
lip
i
do
know
and
that
the
truth
she
admitted
the
news
knocked
me
over
and
and
i
was
flurried
and
besides
well
two
heads
are
better
than
one
and
lady
eleanor
understood
this
dancing
girl
meant
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
lord
auchester
marrying
her
lady
eleanor
but
that
she
was
terribly
afraid
that
he
would
marry
this
girl
in
the
country
this
leslie
lisle
she
rose
i
can
say
nothing
i
am
not
lord
auchester
keeper
if
he
chooses
to
marry
a
dairy
maid
or
worse
it
is
his
business
finetta
watched
her
keenly
but
all
the
same
you
do
all
you
can
to
prevent
it
she
said
sharply
and
with
an
air
of
conviction
she
had
caught
a
significant
gleam
in
the
proud
eyes
lady
eleanor
turned
pale
stood
a
moment
as
if
waiting
to
see
if
finetta
had
anything
more
to
say
then
with
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
passed
out
of
the
shop
she
walked
proudly
and
haughtily
enough
to
her
brougham
but
when
she
got
inside
her
manner
changed
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
cowered
in
the
corner
trembling
and
moaning
yorke
going
to
marry
going
to
marry
and
beneath
him
too
he
had
passed
her
over
for
some
country
wench
some
nobody
beneath
him
in
rank
utterly
unworthy
of
him
it
tortured
her
what
should
she
do
what
could
be
done
she
asked
herself
this
as
the
carriage
rolled
on
homeward
and
for
a
time
no
answer
came
then
suddenly
she
started
and
pulled
the
check
string
the
nearest
telegraph
office
she
said
to
the
footman
there
was
only
one
person
who
could
help
her
even
if
he
would
which
was
doubtful
she
sent
a
telegram
to
ralph
duncombe
can
you
come
and
see
me
at
once
on
important
business
meanwhile
all
unconscious
of
the
strange
meeting
between
his
two
old
loves
yorke
betook
himself
to
the
army
and
navy
stores
and
whiled
away
the
time
by
buying
a
lady
portmanteau
one
of
the
latest
and
most
expensive
kind
and
ordering
the
initials
l
a
to
be
painted
on
it
this
afforded
him
a
subtle
delight
leslie
auchester
how
well
it
sounded
leslie
viscountess
auchester
take
the
peerage
all
through
and
there
would
be
a
more
beautiful
charming
woman
than
this
wife
of
his
he
bought
one
or
two
other
things
traveling
luxuries
which
should
add
to
her
comfort
on
their
journey
then
went
back
to
the
club
any
telegram
for
me
he
asked
almost
confidently
no
my
lord
was
the
reply
yorke
face
clouded
then
it
cleared
look
here
he
said
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
it
would
be
addressed
to
yorke
the
porter
looked
in
the
and
shook
his
head
nothing
for
that
name
either
my
lord
yorke
stood
at
the
door
of
the
porter
glass
box
and
stared
at
the
man
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
ears
then
he
swung
round
and
jumping
into
a
cab
told
the
man
to
drive
to
arnheim
he
met
the
dealer
coming
down
the
stairs
oh
good
morning
my
lord
he
said
i
have
written
to
you
yes
yes
lisle
has
he
been
here
yes
my
lord
said
arnheim
looking
at
the
handsome
and
palpably
agitated
face
curiously
he
has
been
here
with
with
his
daughter
miss
lisle
yes
and
he
has
left
some
pictures
of
course
your
lordship
knows
best
but
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
it
only
right
that
the
pictures
are
utterly
i
know
i
know
yorke
broke
in
quickly
that
all
right
i
mean
it
does
matter
i
explain
afterward
what
i
want
now
is
their
address
port
yes
yes
i
know
i
mean
their
london
address
where
they
staying
the
dealer
thought
a
moment
while
yorke
looked
at
him
as
if
he
could
tear
the
answer
from
him
i
well
the
fact
is
i
do
know
it
i
did
not
think
to
ask
it
said
arnheim
yorke
flushed
a
dark
red
oh
nonsense
they
must
have
given
you
their
address
some
place
to
write
to
you
naturally
think
so
but
as
it
happens
they
did
said
arnheim
i
admit
i
ought
to
have
asked
lisle
but
well
i
did
i
suppose
i
expected
him
to
call
again
and
with
a
faint
smile
of
course
he
will
do
so
the
man
is
an
enthusiast
i
know
all
about
him
thanks
said
yorke
sternly
what
i
want
is
lisle
address
he
thought
a
moment
then
said
slowly
and
impressively
when
he
calls
next
he
may
do
so
any
hour
be
sure
and
get
the
address
wire
it
to
me
at
the
dorchester
and
at
once
certainly
my
lord
said
arnheim
and
about

pictures

two
or
three
give
him
his
own
price
for
them
but
mind
keep
my
name
out
of
the
business
and
he
ran
down
the
stairs
and
jumped
into
the
cab
again
telling
the
man
to
drive
back
to
the
club
i
stick
there
till
leslie
telegram
comes
he
said
between
his
teeth
if
i
stay
there
till
doomsday
he
was
consumed
by
anxiety
leslie
in
london
and
he
did
not
know
where
good
heavens
could
the
telegram
have
miscarried
was
anything
wrong
he
tried
to
remain
cool
and
confident
but
he
looked
as
he
got
out
of
the
cab
like
a
man
oppressed
by
a
terrible
presentiment
on
the
steps
of
the
club
stood
grey
hallo
said
yorke
grey
grey
touched
his
hat
i
been
to
bury
street
my
lord
and
fleming
sent
me
here
his
grace
is
back
and
would
be
glad
if
you
could
come
and
see
him
yorke
hesitated
and
was
on
the
point
of
sending
a
message
to
say
that
he
would
come
presently
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
duke
had
come
from
portmaris
and
that
he
might
have
some
news
of
the
lisles
all
right
he
said
i
come
at
once
keep
the
cab
he
ran
up
the
steps
to
the
porter
that
telegram
nothing
my
lord
for
you
as
yet
with
something
like
a
groan
yorke
went
slowly
down
the
steps
again
and
into
the
cab
leslie
where
was
she
why
why
had
she
not
wired
as
she
promised
chapter
xxvii
gone
and
left
no
address
the
ducal
house
in
grosvenor
square
was
not
seldom
referred
to
as
an
instance
of
the
extreme
of
luxury
which
this
finish
of
the
century
had
attained
to
it
was
an
immense
place
decorated
by
one
of
the
first
authorities
with
ceilings
painted
by
a
famous
artist
and
walls
draped
by
hangings
for
which
the
orient
had
literally
been
ransacked
the
entrance
hall
was
supposed
to
be
the
finest
in
the
kingdom
it
was
of
marble
and
mosaic
a
fountain
plashed
in
the
center
and
the
light
poured
through
glass
and
warmed
with
a
rose
blush
the
exquisite
carvings
and
statuary
at
the
end
of
the
hall
rose
broad
stairs
of
pure
white
marble
in
the
centre
of
which
was
laid
a
persian
carpet
of
such
thick
pile
that
footsteps
were
hushed
stately
palms
stood
here
and
there
relieving
the
whiteness
of
the
marble
and
the
corners
the
staircase
led
to
the
first
corridor
which
ran
round
the
hall
and
upon
the
walls
of
this
corridor
hung
pictures
by
the
great
english
masters
the
family
portraits
were
at
rothbury
the
state
rooms
were
on
the
ground
floor
and
were
on
a
par
in
the
way
of
luxury
and
magnificence
with
the
hall
altogether
it
was
a
very
great
contrast
to
marine
villa
portmaris
yorke
followed
grey
to
the
hall
and
was
ushered
into
a
room
behind
the
state
apartments
it
was
a
small
room
and
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
house
plainly
furnished
in
oak
there
were
bookshelves
and
a
large
writing
table
and
one
of
those
invalid
couches
which
are
provided
with
bookrests
and
an
elaborate
machinery
which
enables
one
to
move
the
couch
by
merely
pressing
a
lever
on
this
couch
lay
the
duke
of
rothbury
though
the
day
was
warm
a
fire
burned
in
the
grate
and
a
superb
sable
rug
was
tumbled
on
the
couch
as
if
the
invalid
had
pulled
it
off
and
on
restlessly
three
or
four
books
lay
on
the
floor
but
he
was
not
reading
and
he
looked
up
sharply
as
yorke
entered
and
did
not
speak
until
grey
had
closed
the
door
upon
them
then
as
he
held
out
his
hand
and
his
keen
eyes
scanned
yorke
face
he
said
do
you
think
i
have
sent
for
you
to
crow
over
you
yorke
yorke
stood
and
looked
down
at
him
for
a
moment
without
replying
then
he
said
vaguely
crow
over
me
what
do
you
mean
dolph
the
duke
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
sit
down
he
said
you
look
tired
and
knocked
up
is
anything
the
matter
yorke
sank
into
a
chair
and
avoided
the
keen
eyes
matter
what
should
be
the
matter
he
said
evasively
you
do
look
quite
the
thing
but
i
suppose
the
journey
took
it
out
of
you
yes
it
was
the
journey
said
the
duke
dryly
is
it
rather
a
pity
that
you
left
portmaris
said
yorke
after
a
slight
pause
it
was
a
pretty
place
and
healthy
and
all
that
and
i
thought
you
rather
liked
it
than
otherwise
it
a
pity
i
ever
went
there
responded
the
duke
grimly
yorke
looked
up
suddenly
and
caught
the
eyes
fixed
on
him
half
pityingly
why
so
he
asked
i
should
say
you
were
the
better
for
the
change
and
i
should
say
i
was
so
much
the
worse
broke
in
the
duke
and
now
we
have
fenced
with
each
other
and
beat
about
the
bush
yorke
you
think
we
better
be
open
and
above
board
what
do
you
mean
the
duke
raised
himself
a
little
higher
and
worked
the
lever
of
the
couch
so
that
he
brought
himself
facing
yorke
why
do
you
look
as
if
you
were
waiting
for
a
sentence
of
life
or
death
yorke
he
said
quietly
you
look
as
anxious
and
harried
and
worn
as
a
man
might
look
who
stood
on
the
brink
of
ruin
have
you
heard
from
her
he
added
quietly
but
sharply
heard
from
whom
said
yorke
with
averted
eyes
from
miss
lisle
leslie
said
the
duke
yorke
raised
his
eyes
quickly
you
know
he
said
yes
i
know
all
said
the
duke
gravely
almost
sympathetically
and
yes
i
am
sorry
for
you
yorke
no
i
do
mean
to
crow
over
you
though
my
prophesy
has
come
true
and
my
estimate
of
her
and
her
sex
generally
has
proved
the
correct
one
i
am
not
going
to
indulge
in
the
delicious
luxury
of
remarking
told
you
so
i
spare
you
that
indeed
i
have
the
heart
to
do
it
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
been
hoping
all
along
that
my
prophesy
would
be
falsified
and
that
your
faith
in
her
would
be
established
but
it
was
to
be
who
is
it
says
that
a
woman
can
be
beautiful
lovable
magnanimous
clever
everything
but
true
yorke
looked
at
him
with
a
harassed
and
perplexed
frown
what
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
dolph
he
said
the
duke
sat
up
and
scanned
the
face
before
him
in
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
then
said
is
it
possible
that
you
do
know
do
know
what
demanded
yorke
impatiently
what
are
you
talking
about
i
beg
your
pardon
dolph
but
but
i
rather
worried
and
upset
about
something
and
i
this
morning
i
been
expecting
an
important
telegram
for
the
last
two
days
and
it
turned
up
and
there
do
mind
me
but
go
on
and
explain
what
you
were
saying
about
les
miss
lisle
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
from
whom
are
you
expecting
a
telegram
yorke
shall
i
make
a
guess
and
say
the
young
lady
herself
yorke
thought
a
moment
the
color
mounting
to
his
face
then
he
looked
the
duke
straight
in
the
eyes
yes
it
was
from
her
dolph
he
said
i
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
you
get
it
out
of
me
somehow
or
other
if
i
did
own
up
for
i
too
worried
to
keep
on
guard
it
is
from
leslie
i
expecting
that
telegram
and
and
well
look
here
dolph
take
it
quietly
i
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
and
she
consented
he
waited
a
moment
expecting
to
see
the
duke
start
up
and
fly
into
one
of
his
paroxysms
but
the
duke
leant
upon
his
elbow
and
looked
at
him
with
a
grave
and
pitying
regard
i
know
that
he
said
you
knew
that
that
i
had
asked
her
that
she
had
agreed
to
come
up
to
london
and
marry
me
on
the
quiet
exclaimed
yorke
staring
at
him
she
told
you
no
she
did
not
tell
me
that
you
had
arranged
a
clandestine
marriage
said
the
duke
quietly
but
she
confessed
that
you
had
asked
her
to
be
your
wife
and
so
you
were
going
to
marry
her
secretly
was
that
was
that
straight
of
you
yorke
there
was
a
touch
of
gentle
reproach
in
the
tone
that
made
yorke
wince
put
it
that
way
it
was
dolph
he
said
but
look
how
i
am
placed
i
am
up
to
my
ears
in
debt
yes
i
know
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
but
there
it
is
you
see
and
if
it
got
out
that
i
was
marrying
without
money
the
blessed
jews
would
be
down
on
me
and
and
i
knew
you
wanted
me
to
to
marry
someone
else
and
that
i
could
count
on
you
and
so
and
so
i
thought
leslie
and
i
would
get
spliced
quietly
and
wait
till
things
had
blown
over
and
the
duke
dropped
back
on
the
couch
but
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
harassed
anxious
face
my
poor
yorke
you
must
love
her
very
much
yorke
flushed
red
love
her
he
broke
out
then
he
pulled
himself
up
look
here
dolph
i
love
her
so
much
that
if
i
knew
that
by
marrying
her
i
should
have
to
drive
a
hansom
cab
or
sweep
a
crossing
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
marry
her
he
got
up
and
strode
to
and
fro
his
eyes
flashing
i
tell
you
that
life
would
be
worth
living
without
her
why
why
his
voice
rang
low
and
tremulous
i
can
not
get
her
out
of
my
thoughts
day
or
night
i
see
her
face
before
my
eyes
hear
her
voice
always
it
leslie
leslie
and
nothing
else
with
me
i
know
now
i
can
understand
now
why
a
man
cuts
his
throat
or
pitches
himself
off
the
nearest
bridge
when
he
loses
the
woman
he
loves
i
used
to
laugh
at
the
old
stories
at
the
othello
and
romeo
and
juliet
business
but
i
understand
now
it
all
true
every
word
of
it
i
rather
die
any
day
and
anyhow
than
lose
her
and
and
there
you
are
you
see
dolph
with
a
kind
of
rueful
smile
i
as
far
gone
as
a
man
can
be
just
raving
mad
but
it
a
madness
that
will
last
my
life
i
hope
not
said
the
duke
gravely
yorke
i
am
sorry
for
you
i
did
not
know
that
the
thing
had
gone
so
far
i
have
bad
news
for
you
bad
news
echoed
yorke
yes
as
i
said
i
was
right
in
my
estimate
of
leslie
lisle
and
you
were
wrong
she
knows
all
yorke
and
he
paused
and
shrugged
his
bent
shoulders
she
knows
all
said
yorke
almost
stupidly
what
do
you
mean
she
discovered
the
deceit
the
trick
we
had
played
upon
her
how
i
do
not
know
perhaps
she
came
across
a
peerage
or
a
society
paper
referring
to
the
duke
of
rothbury
or
grey
may
have
let
slip
a
word
in
her
hearing
which
revealed
the
secret
who
can
say
after
all
it
was
wonderful
that
we
succeeded
in
keeping
up
the
deceit
so
long
she
was
bound
to
discover
the
truth
sooner
or
later
yorke
gazed
at
him
with
a
troubled
face
you
mean
that
she
discovered
that
you
were
the
duke
and
not
i
he
said
the
duke
nodded
yes
she
came
to
me
early
in
the
morning
so
pale
and
changed
so
thoroughly
overwhelmed
with
disappointment
hold
on
broke
in
yorke
disappointment
do
you
mean
that
she
was
disappointed
that
i
was
not
the
duke
that
she
was
cut
up
that
she
cared
one
straw
my
dear
yorke
if
you
had
seen
her
you
would
have
been
as
astonished
and
as
full
of
remorse
as
i
was
though
the
trick
was
not
yours
but
mine
i
told
her
so
i
took
all
the
blame
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
plead
for
you
she
was
broken
down
with
the
agony
of
disappointment
if
as
you
say
you
had
arranged
a
secret
marriage
with
her
she
looked
upon
herself
as
already
the
duchess
of
rothbury
and
to
have
the
cup
dashed
from
her
lips
my
dear
yorke
one
must
make
all
allowance
for
her
human
nature
is
human
nature
all
the
world
over
especially
feminine
human
nature
yorke
face
went
from
white
to
red
and
from
red
to
white
again
you
are
talking
rot
utter
rot
dolph
he
said
leslie
leslie
lisle
cut
up
and
knocked
over
because
she
was
not
going
to
be
a
duchess
ha
ha
and
he
laughed
scornfully
how
well
you
know
her
she
would
care
a
pin
i
told
you
so
half
a
dozen
times
why
she
was
shrinking
from
the
idea
of
being
a
duchess
would
have
refused
me
for
being
what
i
thought
i
was
if
if
well
if
she
had
cared
for
me
as
she
does
god
bless
her
he
turned
his
head
away
and
his
eyes
grew
moist
the
duke
watched
him
gravely
you
doubt
my
word
yorke
no
no
but
i
say
you
are
mistaken
there
was
something
else
what
else
what
other
cause
could
there
be
no
i
tell
you
that
it
was
the
agony
of
disappointed
ambition
yorke
laughed
again
the
duke
flushed
come
he
said
you
will
not
credit
my
statement
or
rely
on
my
judgment
perhaps
you
are
right
a
man
should
have
faith
in
the
purity
and
of
the
woman
he
loves
but
facts
are
stubborn
things
facts
yes
she
had
arranged
to
come
up
to
london
to
you
to
send
to
you
i
do
know
what
plans
you
made
but
i
can
imagine
them
i
know
how
i
should
have
arranged
in
your
case
well
she
is
in
london
or
has
been
and
has
she
sent
to
you
has
she
met
you
as
she
promised
yorke
gazed
at
him
with
a
half
doubtful
half
scornful
expression
no
he
said
at
last
but
but
there
has
been
some
mistake
blunder
on
somebody
part
the
telegram
has
miscarried
she
may
not
have
been
able
to
send
it
you
know
how
closely
she
waits
upon
her
father
she
may
not
have
been
able
to
get
out
the
duke
shook
his
head
my
dear
yorke
her
last
words
to
me
were
a
distinct
farewell
to
me
and
to
you
i
not
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
the
person
who
informed
her
that
you
were
not
the
duke
had
also
told
her
that
you
were
heavily
in
debt
and
in
queer
street
generally
and
that
she
saw
how
foolish
it
would
be
to
throw
herself
away
and
ruin
her
whole
life
by
making
an
imprudent
marriage
yorke
uttered
an
oath
by
heaven
dolph
if
it
were
anybody
else
but
you
who
talked
of
her
like
this
i
i
make
him
take
his
words
back
the
duke
sighed
even
if
i
were
your
equal
in
strength
and
we
bashed
each
other
it
would
alter
the
truth
a
hair
breadth
he
said
sadly
and
wearily
and
the
truth
is
as
i
prophesied
weeks
ago
and
state
now
leslie
learning
that
you
were
not
the
duke
of
rothbury
has
thrown
you
over
the
truth
it
a
foolish
and
cruel
lie
exclaimed
yorke
his
eyes
blazing
his
hands
clenched
you
always
misjudged
her
you
were
prejudiced
against
her
from
the
first
the
duke
put
his
hand
as
if
to
stop
him
but
the
passionately
indignant
voice
rang
out
from
the
first
she
is
as
pure
and
as
as
an
angel
but
you
had
made
up
your
mind
that
she
was
a
mercenary
schemer
and
not
even
the
being
with
her
and
knowing
her
and
seeing
her
every
day
disabused
your
mind
and
opened
your
eyes
to
the
wrong
you
were
doing
her
yes
you
were
against
her
from
the
first
you
made
your
mind
up
that
ridiculous
idea
of
yours
that
all
women
are
greedy
and
hungry
for
wealth
and
a
title
has
become
a
monomania
with
you
and
your
mind
has
got
as
twisted
as
your
body
he
stopped
aghast
and
breathless
the
words
the
cruel
words
had
slipped
out
on
the
torrent
of
his
indignation
before
be
scarcely
knew
or
realized
their
cruel
significance
the
duke
sank
back
and
put
his
hand
to
his
eyes
as
if
yorke
had
dealt
him
a
physical
blow
yorke
hung
his
head
forgive
me
dolph
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
i
did
not
mean
the
duke
dropped
his
hands
from
before
his
face
let
that
pass
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
did
not
mean
it
it
is
the
first
unkind
word
you
have
ever
but
no
matter
you
say
that
i
was
prejudiced
that
i
wronged
her
yorke
you
have
forced
my
hand
and
to
show
you
that
you
have
wronged
me
i
must
tell
you
all
yorke
he
paused
and
his
eyes
dropped
then
he
raised
them
and
looked
steadily
into
yorke
i
loved
her
yorke
started
you
the
duke
plucked
at
the
sable
rug
for
a
moment
to
silence
then
he
went
on
yes
i
should
not
have
told
you
should
never
have
confessed
it
even
to
myself
but
for
what
you
said
it
is
the
truth
i
loved
her
what
and
he
leant
forward
his
thin
wasted
face
flushed
his
lips
trembling
do
you
think
that
it
is
given
to
you
only
to
appreciate
such
beauty
and
grace
and
sweetness
as
leslie
lisle
you
remind
me
that
i
am
crooked
twisted
deformed
dolph
but
do
you
think
because
i
am
what
i
am
outwardly
that
i
have
no
heart
god
who
sees
below
the
surface
knows
that
there
beats
in
my
bosom
a
heart
as
tender
as
hungry
for
love
as
quick
to
love
as
yours
ah
and
quicker
hungrier
and
i
loved
her
loved
her
with
a
love
as
strong
and
passionate
as
yours
he
stopped
for
want
of
breath
yorke
sank
into
a
chair
and
turned
his
face
away
and
you
did
not
guess
it
well
that
is
not
surprising
for
i
strove
hard
to
hide
it
from
even
myself
i
knew
that
it
was
madness
to
hope
that
i
might
win
her
love
but
i
knew
that
if
i
had
offered
myself
in
my
right
colors
she
would
have
accepted
me
bent
twisted
deformed
mockery
of
a
man
as
i
am
yorke
groaned
and
and
he
stopped
and
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
something
and
i
was
tempted
yes
i
was
tempted
the
morning
she
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
she
knew
was
tempted
to
tell
her
that
she
might
still
be
a
duchess
that
i
loved
her
and
would
marry
her
yorke
sprang
to
his
feet
sit
sit
down
said
the
duke
hoarsely
and
yorke
sank
down
again
but
i
resisted
the
temptation
i
left
her
without
a
word
without
a
look
or
sign
by
which
she
could
know
the
truth
i
had
to
bear
it
it
is
a
burden
which
crushes
which
tortures
me
even
since
i
left
the
cursed
place
the
temptation
has
assailed
me
at
intervals
and
once
or
twice
i
have
almost
resolved
to
write
to
go
down
to
her
and
offer
her
that
upon
which
she
has
set
her
woman
heart
the
ducal
coronet
for
which
even
a
leslie
lisle
will
sell
herself
yorke
opened
his
lips
but
the
duke
by
a
gesture
stopped
him
again
now
you
know
the
whole
truth
if
you
have
to
suffer
so
also
have
i
and
my
lot
will
be
worse
than
yours
you
he
looked
at
him
not
enviously
but
with
a
sad
admiration
you
will
get
over
this
will
forget
her
no
no
yes
there
are
other
women
whose
love
you
may
win
there
is
one
already
he
paused
yes
if
one
nail
drives
out
another
so
one
love
may
drive
out
wipe
out
all
remembrance
of
another
and
so
it
is
with
you
but
i
he
dropped
back
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
for
me
there
can
be
no
such
hope
the
door
of
love
the
gates
of
the
earthly
paradise
are
shut
against
me
and
will
remain
shut
while
i
live
to
me
the
fates
say
mockingly
wealth
station
we
give
you
but
the
love
of
woman
that
supreme
gift
of
the
gods
to
man
thou
shalt
never
know
it
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
yorke
you
must
bear
your
burden
forget
her
it
will
be
hard
i
know
how
hard
to
forget
leslie
those
sweet
gray
eyes
with
their
melting
tenderness
that
low
musical
voice
but
you
must
forget
her
as
i
said
there
are
others
there
is
one
eleanor
yorke
sprang
to
his
feet
forget
her
forget
leslie
what
are
you
talking
about
we
must
be
mad
both
of
us
you
to
talk
as
you
have
done
and
i
to
listen
as
true
as
steel
i
shall
find
a
telegram
waiting
for
me
at
the
club
and
and
all
will
turn
out
right
the
duke
regarded
him
gravely
go
and
see
he
said
quietly
if
you
do
not
find
a
message
from
her
what
will
you
do
yorke
looked
at
him
though
my
body
twisted
my
brain
is
straighter
and
more
acute
than
yours
said
the
duke
with
a
smile
and
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
wire
to
the
landlady
at
the
house
they
lived
in
sea

lisles

and
if

for

and
all

but
i
can
tell
you
the
result
at
once
the
result
what
you
will
not
find

she
does
not
intend
that
you
should
with
all
her
beauty
and
grace
and
sweetness
she
even
she
even
leslie
being
a
woman
is
too
worldly
wise
to
marry
yorke
auchester
now
that
he
is
a
duke
no
longer
yorke
caught
up
his
hat
and
laughed
hoarsely

he
said
and
if
you
do
not
if
you
prove
that
i
am
right
asked
the
duke
looking
at
him
steadily
yorke
stopped
at
the
door
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
then
then
he
stopped
and
swore
then
you
may
do
what
you
like
with
me
marry
me
to
whom
you
please
when
you
please
send
me
to
the
devil
he
strode
through
the
marble
hall
and
called
a
cab
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
dorchester
and
confronted
the
patient
stephens
there
a
telegram
for
me
now
stephens

the

and
going

sent
the
following
telegram
to
merrick

hour
and
a
half
and
then
they
handed

and
miss

gone
and
left
no

he
walked
from
the
post
office
to
grosvenor
square
with
the
telegram
crushed
in
his
hand
and
went
straight
to
the
duke
room
he
was
still
lying
on
the
couch
and
he
did
not
lift
his
head
as
yorke
entered
well
he
said
but
i
need

dropped
it
into
the
duke
hand

london
and
i
do
not
know
where
to
look
for
her
he
said
hoarsely
convinced
no
no
then
his
voice
broke
and
he
sank
into
the
chair
by
the
table
and
dropped
his
head
upon
his
arms
the
duke
sighed
my
poor
yorke
oh
woman
woman
god

you
as
a
blessing
and
you
have
proved
a
curse
chapter
xxviii
i
would
do
anything
to
save
him
lady
eleanor
reached
palace
gardens
and
went
straight
to
her
boudoir
and
flung
herself
on
a
couch
to
women
of
her
class
come
very
few
such
adventures
as
that
which
had
happened
to
her
this
morning
from
their
cradles
through
their
girlhood
and
indeed
all
through
their
lives
they
are
so
hedged
in
and
protected
from
the
world
outside
the
refined
and
exclusive
circle
in
which
they
move
that
there
is
little
chance
of
their
coming
in
contact
with
other
than
their
own
set
she
had
seen
finetta
on
the
stage
of
the
diadem
had
heard
of
her
read
of
her
knew
that
yorke
auchester
name
was
in
some
way
connected
with
her
but
she
had
never
dreamed
that
a
meeting
with
her
would
be
even
possible
much
less
probable
and
now
she
had
not
only
met
with
her
but
talked
and
listened
to
her
the
fact
that
she
had
done
so
filled
her
with
shame
and
confusion
what
would
her
friends
and
relatives
think
if
they
knew
what
would
godolphin
the
duke
say
if
he
were
told
that
she
had
not
only
engaged
in
conversation
with
this
finetta
but
actually
entered
into
a
kind
of
compact
and
conspiracy
with
her
but
she
soon
dismissed
this
part
of
the
case
and
allowed
herself
to
think
only
of
the
information
finetta
had
given
her
yorke
going
to
be
married
she
would
almost
as
soon
have
heard
that
he
was
going
to
die
indeed
death
would
not
more
completely
remove
him
for
her
would
not
set
up
a
more
surmountable
barrier
between
them
than
a
marriage
for
if
he
were
to
die
she
could
still
think
and
dream
of
him
as
hers
whereas
if
he
married
he
would
belong
in
this
world
and
the
next
to
another
woman
and
such
a
woman
finetta
had
spoken
of
this
leslie
lisle
as
if
she
were
an
uncultivated
country
girl
lady
eleanor
could
imagine
what
she
was
like
some
simpering
girl
just
a
step
above
a
laborer
daughter
one
of
these
girls
who
blushed
with
timidity
and
fright
when
they
were
spoken
to
who
spoke
in
a
strong
provincial
dialect
who
dressed
like
a
dowdy
and
looked
just
respectable
something
between
a
servant
and
a
shop
girl
she
was
pretty
no
doubt
but
to
think
that
yorke
yorke
the
fastidious
should
be
caught
by
a
pretty
face
why
she
lady
eleanor
was
pretty
she
looked
at
her
pale
agitated
face
and
a
kind
of
indignant
rage
consumed
her
for
a
moment
she
was
the
acknowledged
belle
of
many
a
ballroom
she
might
have
been
a
professional
beauty
if
she
had
cared
to
be
one
she
was
accomplished
was
in
his
own
rank
and
class
a
fitting
mate
yes
she
told
herself
with
inward
conviction
a
fitting
mate
for
him
with
her
by
his
side
as
his
wife
he
could
have
filled
a
conspicuous
place
in
the
world
their
world
the
upper
ten
thousand
the
rulers
and
masters
and
he
had
passed
her
by
and
was
going
to
marry
a
uncivilized
uncultivated
country
girl
with
pink
cheeks
and
a
simpering
smile
the
thought
drove
her
half
mad
finetta
had
said
that
she
had
tried
to
prevent
it
and
that
it
now
rested
with
her
lady
eleanor
to
make
an
attempt
lady
eleanor
shuddered
and
reddened
with
shame
at
the
idea
of
being
a
conspirator
with
such
a
one
as
finetta
of
the
diadem
and
yet
was
not
the
object
to
be
attained
worthy
of
even
such
means
she
would
not
ask
herself
why
finetta
desired
to
stop
the
marriage
she
put
that
question
away
from
her
resolutely
and
told
herself
that
it
was
of
yorke
and
yorke
welfare
alone
that
she
was
thinking
a
servant
came
up
to
announce
visitors
but
lady
eleanor
answered
through
the
locked
door
that
she
was
at
home
i
will
only
see
ralph
duncombe
she
said
and
she
longed
for
his
presence
with
a
feverish
impatience
though
she
had
no
fixed
plan
in
her
mind
nothing
but
a
vague
idea
that
ralph
duncombe
the
cute
city
man
might
be
able
to
help
her
about
six
the
servant
announced
him
and
she
had
him
shown
up
to
her
boudoir
she
had
had
time
to
collect
herself
and
regain
composure
to
change
her
dress
for
a
tea
gown
and
do
her
hair
but
her
face
was
pale
and
still
showed
traces
of
the
terrible
agitation
which
she
had
suffered
and
ralph
duncombe
as
he
took
her
hand
looked
at
her
inquiringly
i
am
afraid
you
have
found
the
heat
trying
lady
eleanor
i
hope
you
are
well
he
said
in
his
grave
sedate
voice
thank
you
yes
she
said
i
am
well
quite
well
but
i
am
what
is
the
term
you
city
men
use
when
you
want
to
say
that
you
are
worried
pray
sit
down
and
she
pointed
to
a
chair
so
placed
that
she
could
see
his
face
while
hers
was
against
the
light
we
find
good
enough
for
us
lady
eleanor
but
we
are
worried
so
often
that
we
think
little
of
it
and
take
things
very
much
as
they
come
ah
then
i
envy
you
she
said
with
a
genuine
sigh
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
very
inconsiderate
in
sending
for
you
you
who
have
so
much
to
occupy
your
time
and
energies
i
am
always
glad
to
be
of
some
slight
service
to
you
he
said
with
grave
courtesy
and
can
always
spare
time
to
come
to
you
when
you
send
for
me
is
anything
the
matter
are
you
anxious
about
the
mining
company
you
have
no
cause
to
be
for
everything
is
going
on
remarkably
well
and
succeeding
beyond
my
expectations
some
of
the
best
men
in
the
city
have
joined
us
and
as
i
wrote
to
you
the
shares
already
stand
at
a
high
premium
you
have
made
a
very
large
sum
of
money
lady
eleanor
and
are
on
the
way
to
making
a
still
larger
money
money
she
exclaimed
it
is
always
money
you
talk
as
if
it
were
the
one
and
only
thing
desirable
and
worth
having
and
after
all
what
can
it
buy
can
it
buy
the
one
thing
on
which
one
heart
is
set
have
you
found
it
so
that
you
set
such
store
by
it
his
face
flushed
and
a
singular
look
came
into
his
eyes
i
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
hurriedly
and
almost
humbly
i
did
not
mean
to
be
impertinent
or
obtrusive
but
just
now
i
am
in
trouble
in
which
i
think
even
the
money
will
be
powerless
tell
me
what
it
is
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
rather
absently
as
if
the
hasty
words
she
had
just
spoken
were
still
haunting
him
that
is
i
suppose
you
sent
to
consult
me
about
it
well
yes
said
lady
eleanor
more
calmly
but
with
her
color
coming
and
going
i
sent
to
you
because
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
whom
i
should
care
to
consult
about
this
this
trouble
because
i
feel
that
you
will
understand
and
what
is
more
important
not
misunderstand
me
or
or
my
motives
i
will
do
my
best
to
understand
and
sympathize
lady
eleanor
he
said
watching
her
yet
without
seeming
to
do
so
you
remember
she
said
after
a
pause
during
which
she
was
seeking
for
some
way
of
beginning
the
subject
as
if
it
were
not
of
much
importance
after
all
you
remember
yorke
auchester
lord
yorke
auchester
he
inclined
his
head
suppressing
a
look
of
surprise
certainly
he
said
that
is
i
remember
i
could
not
fail
to
do
so
that
i
have
purchased
his
debts
to
a
very
large
sum
on
your
behalf
yes
she
said
nervously
and
i
daresay
i
know
that
you
have
wondered
why
i
have
done
so
he
kept
silence
but
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
well
she
went
on
it
was
to
save
him
from
trouble
he
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
his
cousin
the
duke
and
i
are
great
friends
but
you
know
all
this
and
now
i
want
to
do
something
more
for
for
lord
auchester
he
looked
up
her
face
was
red
one
moment
and
pale
the
next
but
she
kept
her
eyes
the
eyes
upon
his
he
is
in
great
trouble
and
and
danger
a
worse
danger
than
a
monetary
one
he
smiled
can
there
be
worse
he
said
with
a
city
man
incredulity
we
live
in
a
prosaic
age
lady
eleanor
from
which
we
have
dismissed
the
midnight
assassin
and
all
the
other
romantic
perils
which
made
life
and
history
so
interesting
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
only
dangers
we
run
now
are
from
a
railway
or
steamboat
accident
she
tried
to
listen
to
him
patiently
it
is
not
that
kind
of
danger
i
was
thinking
she
said
is
it
not
possible
for
a
man
to
to
ruin
and
wreck
his
life
in
many
ways
mr
duncombe
he
looked
at
her
still
half
smilingly
oh
yes
a
man
may
enlist
as
a
common
soldier
or
forge
a
check
or
marry
his
cook
but
i
do
not
imagine
that
there
is
any
risk
of
lord
auchester
committing
any
of
these
shall
we
say
follies
of
all
the
things
you
have
mentioned
it
seems
to
me
that
the
last
is
the
worst
said
lady
eleanor
bitterly
yes
he
raised
his
brows
again
at
any
rate
it
is
punished
more
severely
than
the
others
she
said
yes
he
assented
thoughtfully
but
and
he
smiled
lord
auchester
does
not
contemplate
marrying
his
cook
does
he
his
cook
no
but
he
is
in
danger
of
marrying
almost
as
far
beneath
him
the
retort
flashed
from
her
with
hot
hauteur
duncombe
when
a
man
of
lord
auchester
station
marries
beneath
him
he
is
as
utterly
ruined
his
life
is
as
completely
wrecked
as
if
he
had
committed
forgery
or
enlisted
as
a
common
soldier
he
leaned
back
and
listened
with
sedate
politeness
wondering
whither
all
this
was
leading
and
what
it
was
she
would
ask
him
to
do
a
man
of
lord
auchester
rank
has
only
one
life
the
social
one
he
has
no
business
no
profession
to
fall
back
upon
to
employ
his
thoughts
to
engross
and
solace
him
he
must
mix
in
the
world
to
which
he
belongs
and
he
can
only
do
so
as
an
equal
with
his
fellows
when
he
marries
he
is
expected
to
take
for
a
wife
a
lady
of
his
own
rank
or
at
any
rate
a
lady
who
is
accepted
as
such
in
the
circle
to
which
he
belongs
she
must
be
one
whom
his
friends
can
receive
and
visit
one
of
whom
neither
he
nor
they
will
be
ashamed
his
life
may
then
continue
in
its
old
course
he
will
still
have
his
friends
and
relatives
round
him
still
have
his
place
in
the
world
his
niche
be
it
a
high
or
a
moderately
high
one
and
all
will
be
well
with
him
she
paused
for
breath
and
put
her
hand
to
smooth
back
the
delicate
silken
hair
from
her
fair
forehead
but
if
he
should
so
far
forget
himself
and
all
he
owes
to
society
as
to
marry
beneath
him
then
as
i
say
he
is
utterly
wrecked
and
undone
his
friends
will
not
receive
his
wife
or
if
they
do
it
is
with
a
coldness
which
she
and
he
can
not
fail
to
notice
and
resent
he
sees
them
look
pityingly
scornfully
upon
the
woman
he
has
made
his
wife
and
he
feels
that
he
can
not
take
her
amongst
them
so
he
drifts
from
his
own
class
and
either
sinks
into
the
one
below
it
where
he
is
wretchedly
miserable
or
lives
like
a
hermit
in
the
latter
case
he
has
plenty
of
time
in
which
to
get
tired
of
his
life
and
of
the
woman
who
has
in
all
innocence
severed
him
from
all
his
old
associates
and
still
in
all
innocence
has
degraded
him
the
result
be
it
quick
or
slow
in
coming
is
invariably
the
same
he
is
always
thinking
of
the
sacrifice
he
has
made
in
marrying
her
she
is
always
conscious
that
he
is
so
thinking
and
sooner
or
later
they
grow
to
weary
of
and
hate
each
other
she
has
ruined
him
wrecked
his
life
and
both
know
it
i
am
not
speaking
by
theory
i
have
seen
it
seen
it
in
half
a
dozen
cases
and
i
say
that
a
man
had
better
throw
himself
into
the
thames
than
marry
beneath
him
she
dropped
back
in
her
low
chair
and
put
her
hand
to
her
head
she
had
talked
swiftly
passionately
and
her
brow
was
burning
ralph
duncombe
looked
up
all
you
say
is
very
true
no
doubt
lady
eleanor
and
lord
auchester
is
thinking
of
making
such
a
match
she
said
in
a
low
voice
ralph
duncombe
looked
at
the
carpet
it
scarcely
seems
pardon
me
scarcely
seems
credible
i
do
not
know
lord
auchester
but
from
what
i
have
heard
of
him
i
should
think
he
would
be
the
last
man
to
be
blind
to
the
consequences
of
contracting
a
marriage
with
a
lady
who
was
considered
his
inferior
in
the
social
scale
ah
yes
she
said
with
a
sigh
so
anyone
who
knew
him
would
have
said
but
but
in
this
matter
even
the
wisest
men
are
fools
he
smiled
gravely
yes
fools
she
said
bitterly
they
are
caught
by
a
pretty
face
a
look
in
the
eyes
a
curve
on
the
lip
a
dimple
in
the
cheek
she
rose
and
took
one
or
two
paces
as
if
her
impatience
would
not
permit
of
her
sitting
still
any
longer
at
any
rate
lord
auchester
has
been
so
caught
she
wound
up
suddenly
and
you
wish
ah
i
scarcely
know
she
answered
stretching
out
her
hands
he
is
doing
this
thing
secretly
he
is
keeping
it
from
his
friends
from
the
duke
from
from
me
from
all
of
us
then
he
is
half
ashamed
of
it
he
suggested
perhaps
so
she
said
perhaps
so
but
if
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
do
it
he
will
go
through
with
it
in
spite
of
all
arguments
and
attempts
to
dissuade
him
yorke
she
used
his
christian
name
unconsciously
yorke
is
one
of
the
sweetest
tempered
men
you
can
lead
him
with
a
silken
thread
until
he
has
resolved
to
do
anything
then
she
had
turned
to
him
and
looked
at
him
beseechingly
can
you
help
me
us
his
friends
i
mean
generally
he
is
so
popular
so
much
liked
it
would
be
a
shame
and
a
sin
that
such
a
one
should
be
wrecked
and
ruined
in
such
a
case
a
man
should
be
saved
in
spite
of
himself
can
nothing
be
done
i
sent
for
you
because
you
have
always
helped
me
have
always
been
so
kind
she
stopped
and
turned
her
head
away
ralph
duncombe
regarded
her
with
grave
surprise
i
am
very
sorry
he
said
slowly
as
a
lawyer
speaks
to
a
client
to
whom
he
has
been
listening
patiently
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
act
in
the
matter
you
might
try
persuasion
she
shook
her
head
ah
you
do
not
know
lord
auchester
she
said
i
scarcely
see
what
else
you
can
do
he
of
age
and
his
own
master
and
the
lady
is
of
age
i
presume
you
could
scarce
bring
any
pressure
upon
her
lady
eleanor
shook
her
head
scornfully
it
is
scarcely
to
be
expected
that
she
would
be
induced
to
release
him
in
these
cases
the
woman
is
generally
a
schemer
or
some
simple
girl
who
believes
that
she
and
the
man
she
is
ruining
are
in
love
oh
no
nothing
can
be
done
with
her
besides
i
know
she
was
going
to
say
i
know
one
who
has
tried
and
failed
but
stopped
suddenly
well
then
said
ralph
duncombe
i
fear
that
i
can
suggest
nothing
after
all
if
lord
auchester
is
resolved
upon
committing
social
suicide
oh
it
is
terrible
terrible
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
agitated
voice
and
i
thought
you
would
be
able
to
help
me
i
am
very
sorry
at
being
so
useless
he
put
in
i
thought
that
perhaps
these
bills
you
hold
for
me
that
they
would
give
you
some
power
over
him
and
she
colored
and
cast
her
eyes
down
he
smiled
there
is
no
longer
arrest
for
debt
lady
eleanor
he
said
they
say
there
is
no
longer
imprisonment
but
that
is
not
true
they
imprison
still
but
they
call
it
for
contempt
of
court
ah
it
is
a
pity
we
are
not
living
in
the
dark
ages
we
could
have
set
an
ambush
for
lord
auchester
seized
him
bodily
and
cast
him
into
a
dungeon
below
the
moat
until
he
had
come
to
his
senses
but
there
is
an
absurd
prejudice
against
that
kind
of
thing
nowadays
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
taking
her
silence
as
an
acceptation
of
the
fact
that
he
could
be
of
no
use
to
her
he
reached
for
his
hat
and
prepared
to
go
i
suppose
it
is
the
usual
thing
he
said
sympathetically
some
girl
of
the
lower
middle
class
has
attracted
him
and
she
and
her
parents
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
promise
of
marriage
from
him
it
is
not
an
uncommon
case
lady
eleanor
had
sunk
into
the
chair
again
and
answered
languidly
for
the
excitement
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
her
i
do
not
know
the
details
of
the
affair
it
is
very
probable
the
girl
name
is
lisle
leslie
lisle
what
the
exclamation
broke
from
him
with
the
suddenness
of
a
gunshot
lady
eleanor
looked
up
but
he
had
turned
and
stood
at
a
little
distance
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
though
pale
as
usual
his
face
was
set
and
calm
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
quite
catch
the
name
he
said
he
spoke
very
slowly
enunciating
each
word
distinctly
as
if
he
were
uncertain
of
his
voice
i
did
not
quite
catch
the
name
leslie
lisle
said
lady
eleanor
he
met
her
at
a
place
called
portmaris
you
may
remember
that
i
mentioned
it
to
you
when
you
were
here
some
weeks
ago
yes
i
remember
he
said
in
just
the
same
slow
mechanical
voice
he
put
his
hat
down
and
sat
with
tightly
set
lips
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
carpet
lady
eleanor
looked
at
his
grave
set
face
waiting
have
you
thought
of
anything
any
plan
by
which
the
marriage
could
be
prevented
she
asked
anxiously
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
then
without
looking
up
he
said
and
they
are
to
be
married
secretly
yes
and
her
face
flushed
and
paled
and
at
once
he
asked
and
she
thought
his
voice
was
strangely
hoarse
at
once
i
i
am
told
at
once
he
repeated
as
if
to
himself
lady
eleanor
i
see
a
carafe
of
water
on
that
side
table
will
you
allow
me
he
rose
and
crossed
the
room
and
drank
nearly
a
glassful
of
water
while
lady
eleanor
pressed
him
to
allow
her
to
ring
for
wine
no
no
water
i
prefer
water
i
am
almost
a
teetotaler
thanks
thanks
he
waved
his
hand
impatiently
almost
imperiously
and
is
that
all
you
know
do
you
know
the
place
they
are
going
to
be
married
at
no
she
said
lord
auchester
is
in
london
she
added
after
a
moment
i
saw
him
this
morning
he
leant
his
head
on
his
hand
so
that
his
face
was
almost
completely
concealed
from
her
in
london
to
be
married
at
once
he
repeated
he
looked
up
i
am
thinking
lady
eleanor
oh
yes
yes
she
breathed
leaning
forward
i
know
if
you
will
only
think
you
will
find
some
way
it
is
a
shame
to
bother
and
trouble
you
he
smiled
grimly
do
mention
it
let
me
see
he
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
he
is
fearfully
in
debt
some
of
those
bills
are
long
overdue
do
you
think
he
means
to
leave
the
country
he
asked
the
question
suddenly
with
a
flash
i
i
do
know
he
must
i
should
think
i
see
i
see
he
said
say
do
be
too
hopeful
too
sanguine
but
well
the
law
has
long
claws
still
though
we
have
pared
them
down
pretty
considerably
and
in
the
city
its
claws
are
longer
than
elsewhere
that
an
anomaly
but
it
true
in
a
city
court
of
law
you
can
do
strange
things
for
instance
if
a
man
owes
me
money
and
i
go
and
swear
that
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
intending
to
leave
the
country
to
abscond
in
short
the
court
has
an
almost
forgotten
power
to
stop
that
man
the
machinery
is
antiquated
and
rusty
but
but
it
may
be
made
to
work
he
rose
a
strange
light
was
burning
in
his
eyes
a
hectic
flush
on
his
pale
and
rather
hollow
cheeks
lady
eleanor
what
is
it
she
asked
almost
frightened
by
the
change
in
his
manner
by
the
subdued
eagerness
and
earnestness
where
a
few
minutes
ago
was
only
polite
indifference
lady
eleanor
if
i
consent
to
help
you
i
can
do
so
on
one
condition
yes
what
is
that
she
asked
trembling
a
little
that
you
follow
my
instructions
to
the
letter
that
you
leave
the
whole
matter
to
me
and
offer
no
opposition
to
anything
i
may
direct
or
do
i
see
mark
me
i
see
a
small
chance
a
slight
hope
of
saving
lord
auchester
from
this
he
smiled
scornfully
ruinous
marriage
it
is
but
slight
and
to
do
anything
with
it
i
must
have
a
free
hand
will
you
give
it
me
i
will
she
said
i
would
do
anything
anything
to
save
him
and
so
would
i
he
muttered
but
so
low
that
she
did
not
hear
him
chapter
xxix
the
new
lodger
some
blows
which
fate
deals
us
are
so
severe
and
crushing
that
for
a
time
they
deprive
us
of
the
power
of
feeling
and
of
such
a
nature
was
the
bereavement
which
leslie
had
suffered
she
was
simply
crushed
and
powerless
to
feel
or
to
act
fortunately
the
landlady
of
the
london
and
the
young
doctor
were
persons
and
they
came
to
her
aid
francis
lisle
had
quarreled
with
and
separated
himself
from
his
people
years
ago
and
leslie
scarcely
knew
his
relations
by
name
but
she
found
the
addresses
of
one
or
two
and
the
doctor
wrote
to
them
it
is
a
hard
world
one
can
forgive
one
relations
many
sins
but
that
of
poverty
is
the
unpardonable
one
and
those
of
her
kin
to
whom
the
doctor
wrote
doubtless
regarded
this
sudden
death
of
francis
lisle
as
an
additional
injury
dealt
to
them
by
that
eccentric
and
unfortunate
man
one
brother
wrote
a
letter
to
leslie
expressing
the
deepest
sympathy
and
regretting
that
a
severe
attack
of
the
gout
would
prevent
him
attending
the
funeral
but
desiring
her
to
be
sure
and
let
him
know
if
he
could
do
anything
for
her
a
cousin
sent
his
secretary
with
a
note
if
it
should
be
needed
and
another
relative
wrote
to
say
how
sorry
he
was
and
that
he
should
of
course
attend
the
funeral
and
that
he
hoped
and
trusted
poor
francis
had
left
his
daughter
well
provided
for
he
added
incidentally
that
he
himself
had
a
large
family
and
had
had
a
great
deal
of
sickness
that
year
also
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
taken
her
into
his
house
if
it
had
not
been
so
small
and
already
overcrowded
the
head
of
the
family
wrote
her
a
short
note
from
a
german
watering
place
saying
that
he
was
in
such
a
wretched
state
of
health
that
he
could
not
come
to
england
excepting
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
that
it
would
probably
not
be
long
before
he
joined
her
father
in
the
realms
above
ai
it
dreadful
sir
said
the
landlady
to
the
doctor
they
seem
to
have
a
heart
amongst
he
shook
his
head
he
had
seen
similar
cases
i
am
afraid
miss
lisle
is
not
very
well
off
he
said
if
she
had
been
an
heiress
her
relatives
would
have
flocked
round
her
overflowing
with
sympathy
and
offers
of
assistance
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
brown
i
fear
miss
leslie
will
feel
this
neglect
and
very
keenly
we
must
do
all
we
can
for
her
yes
sir
that
we
will
said
the
woman
with
moist
eyes
as
to
feeling
it
i
do
think
dear
miss
lisle
feels
anything
at
present
i
could
scarcely
rouse
her
to
see
about
her
mourning
and
it
makes
heart
ache
to
go
into
the
room
and
see
her
sitting
there
in
her
plain
black
dress
she
would
have
it
so
simple
and
no
crape
though
i
told
her
that
crape
was
always
worn
for
a
father
sitting
there
and
just
looking
before
her
as
if
she
was
too
weak
and
overcome
even
to
think
it
my
opinion
sir
that
she
scarcely
realizes
what
has
happened
to
her
yet
since
the
day
he
died
she
has
shed
a
tear
and
such
a
sweet
young
soul
as
she
is
and
so
grateful
for
the
littlest
thing
one
does
for
her
but
there
she
was
always
the
nicest
young
lady
that
i
ever
took
in
always
and
if
her
relations
is
too
proud
or
too
heartless
to
look
after
her
why
she
sha
want
for
a
friend
while
martha
brown
has
got
a
shilling
the
landlady
graphic
description
of
leslie
condition
was
a
fairly
truthful
one
day
after
day
leslie
sat
with
her
hands
lying
listlessly
in
the
lap
of
her
black
dress
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
trees
in
the
square
her
sorrow
too
great
for
thought
if
she
had
overheard
the
landlady
and
the
doctor
discussing
her
future
she
would
have
listened
with
perfect
indifference
what
did
it
matter
what
became
of
her
or
whether
she
lived
or
went
to
join
the
poor
weak
soul
whom
she
had
loved
and
cherished
and
yet
ah
what
bitterness
was
in
the
thought
deceived
if
she
had
not
listened
to
proposal
had
not
consented
to
his
plan
of
bringing
her
to
london
her
father
might
be
alive
now
it
was
true
that
the
doctor
had
assured
her
that
the
weakness
of
the
heart
which
had
been
the
immediate
cause
of
death
had
been
latent
for
some
time
and
that
her
father
had
been
a
doomed
and
sentenced
man
for
years
past
and
that
any
shock
would
have
been
sufficient
to
cause
his
death
but
even
this
assurance
scarcely
softened
the
poignancy
of
her
remorse
it
was
of
her
father
and
his
loss
that
she
thought
entirely
during
the
days
immediately
following
her
bereavement
and
it
might
be
almost
said
that
she
had
forgotten
yorke
and
her
great
love
for
him
almost
but
not
quite
it
was
lying
in
the
centre
of
her
heart
buried
for
a
time
under
the
load
of
her
anguish
and
sorrow
but
it
needed
only
a
sight
of
him
only
the
sound
of
his
name
to
arise
like
a
giant
and
reassert
all
its
old
influence
over
her
after
a
while
she
began
to
recover
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
think
to
realize
her
position
and
to
look
vaguely
and
indifferently
towards
the
future
the
doctor
and
the
secretary
of
the
great
man
had
gone
into
francis
lisle
affairs
and
discovered
that
a
portion
of
his
small
income
had
died
with
him
and
that
what
remained
amounted
to
only
a
few
pounds
a
year
not
enough
by
itself
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
there
was
a
little
money
in
hand
but
the
largest
part
of
that
sum
consisted
of
the
fifty
pounds
paid
by
temple
for
the
picture
he
had
bought
and
leslie
directly
she
was
able
to
think
resolved
that
she
would
return
the
money
though
it
and
it
alone
should
stand
between
her
and
starvation
there
was
something
else
also
that
she
must
return
the
diamond
pendant
which
yorke
had
given
her
that
too
must
go
back
she
could
not
summon
up
sufficient
courage
to
take
it
from
its
as
yet
and
indeed
she
did
not
know
where
to
send
it
unless
she
addressed
it
to
the
dorchester
club
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
send
so
valuable
an
article
to
a
club
that
she
ought
to
send
it
to
the
duke
residence
a
woman
of
the
world
would
have
been
aware
that
the
address
of
so
a
personage
as
the
duke
of
rothbury
could
be
found
in
a
london
directory
but
leslie
was
anything
but
a
woman
of
the
world
and
felt
helpless
in
her
ignorance
there
was
another
article
which
lay
in
her
box
beside
the
diamond
pendant
ralph
duncombe
ring
she
remembered
that
in
a
weary
listless
way
he
had
said
when
he
placed
it
in
her
hand
that
if
ever
she
needed
a
friend
a
helper
an
avenger
she
had
but
to
send
that
ring
to
him
and
he
would
come
to
her
side
but
though
she
were
in
the
sorest
strait
in
which
a
woman
could
be
placed
she
would
not
summon
ralph
duncombe
to
her
aid
for
to
do
so
would
be
tantamount
to
engaging
herself
to
him
the
mere
thought
made
her
wince
and
shudder
it
was
an
insult
to
the
love
that
lay
dormant
in
her
bosom
her
love
for
yorke
one
day
she
got
out
her
money
and
spread
it
on
the
table
and
counted
it
with
the
strictest
economy
it
would
not
go
very
far
and
it
was
all
that
stood
between
her
and
the
grim
wolf
destitution
for
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
die
than
appeal
for
assistance
to
her
relatives
in
the
struggle
for
life
we
forget
our
dead
says
the
philosopher
and
the
problem
of
what
was
to
become
of
her
gradually
drew
her
away
from
the
sad
brooding
over
her
bereavement
what
should
she
do
she
could
not
dig
and
to
beg
she
was
ashamed
the
question
haunted
her
day
and
night
as
she
sat
by
the
window
or
walked
up
and
down
the
room
or
lay
awake
at
night
listening
to
the
multitudinous
london
clocks
striking
the
hours
one
afternoon
she
summoned
up
strength
enough
to
go
out
and
in
her
plain
black
clothes
with
her
veil
closely
drawn
over
her
face
she
walked
through
the
squares
into
oxford
and
regent
streets
she
felt
weak
and
giddy
at
first
and
soon
tired
the
vast
thoroughfares
and
their
eager
busy
crowds
confused
and
bewildered
her
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
every
one
was
looking
at
her
as
if
every
individual
of
the
throng
knew
of
her
trouble
her
double
loss
and
was
pitying
her
and
she
turned
homewards
faint
in
body
and
spirit
as
she
reached
no
she
saw
a
cab
standing
at
the
door
the
cabman
was
carrying
a
modest
box
into
the
house
and
as
she
passed
into
the
narrow
hall
a
young
lady
who
was
talking
with
the
landlady
made
room
for
her
leslie
concluded
that
it
was
a
new
lodger
and
went
up
to
her
own
rooms
to
take
up
the
perpetual
problem
what
should
she
do
she
recalled
all
the
novels
she
had
read
in
which
the
heroines
had
been
left
alone
in
the
world
and
sought
some
help
from
their
experiences
and
course
of
action
but
most
if
not
all
these
heroines
had
been
singularly
gifted
beings
who
had
at
once
stepped
into
fame
and
fortune
as
singers
actors
painters
or
musicians
and
she
leslie
knew
that
she
was
not
gifted
in
any
of
these
directions
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
she
told
herself
that
night
as
she
undressed
herself
wearily
and
hopelessly
nothing
i
am
a
cumberer
of
the
ground
she
had
tired
herself
by
her
walk
and
slept
the
whole
night
for
the
first
time
since
her
father
death
but
she
dreamed
that
she
was
married
to
yorke
and
that
she
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
the
crowd
she
had
seen
in
regent
street
and
that
they
called
her
grace
and
and
she
woke
to
a
sense
of
the
reality
with
a
heart
that
ached
all
the
more
bitterly
for
the
pleasant
dream
was
it
years
ago
that
drive
to
martin
when
he
had
sat
beside
her
and
shown
her
how
to
hold
the
reins
or
did
it
never
happen
and
was
it
only
a
phantasy
of
her
imagination
so
great
a
difference
was
there
between
then
and
now
so
wide
a
gulf
that
only
the
present
seemed
real
and
the
past
a
vision
of
a
disordered
mind
she
unlocked
the
small
box
and
took
out
the
diamond
pendant
and
looked
at
it
and
the
scrap
of
paper
with
the
precious
words
from
yorke
written
on
it
until
the
tears
blotted
them
from
her
sight
but
they
had
recalled
all
the
joy
the
delight
the
sacred
ecstasy
of
the
past
all
too
distinctly
it
was
true
she
leslie
lisle
helpless
friendless
with
only
a
few
pounds
between
her
and
want
was
the
leslie
lisle
who
had
looked
on
that
short
sunlight
of
happiness
she
thought
she
would
make
another
attempt
to
go
out
that
morning
and
after
dressing
slowly
and
putting
off
the
dreaded
moment
of
leaving
the
house
and
facing
the
outside
world
she
went
down
the
stairs
as
she
did
so
the
door
of
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
floor
below
hers
opened
and
the
girl
she
had
seen
in
the
hall
yesterday
came
out
she
stepped
back
as
she
saw
leslie
and
seemed
about
to
beat
a
retreat
back
into
her
own
room
again
then
hesitated
and
made
a
slight
bow
leslie
returned
the
bow
absently
and
went
out
and
it
was
not
until
she
had
got
into
the
crowded
streets
that
she
thought
of
the
girl
then
she
remembered
that
she
too
was
dressed
in
black
and
that
though
not
more
pretty
she
was
modest
and
looked
like
a
lady
and
wore
eyeglasses
she
thought
no
more
of
her
than
this
and
after
a
weary
walk
returned
home
and
rang
the
bell
for
some
tea
when
the
door
opened
she
was
surprised
to
see
the
girl
instead
of
brown
and
her
surprise
must
have
shown
itself
in
her
face
for
her
visitor
colored
and
stopped
at
the
threshold
i
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
but
brown
has
sprained
her
wrist
and
she
asked
me
that
is
i
offered
to
come
instead
of
her
leslie
rose
and
looked
at
her
with
the
half
startled
expression
which
indicated
her
condition
of
mind
i
i
wanted
some
tea
but
it
does
not
matter
she
said
in
a
low
voice
the
colored
oh
but
i
will
get
it
for
you
she
said
i
will
get
anything
for
you
that
is
if
you
do
mind
my
doing
it
instead
of
mrs
brown
leslie
looked
at
her
more
attentively
and
saw
a
pleasant
amiable
face
with
eyes
beaming
softly
through
eyeglasses
perched
on
a
nose
you
are
very
kind
she
said
in
a
low
musical
voice
but
i
do
not
think
i
ought
to
trouble
you
oh
it
is
no
trouble
miss
lisle
said
the
girl
still
standing
on
the
threshold
as
if
she
dared
not
venture
further
you
know
my
name
said
leslie
with
a
faint
smile
yes
said
her
visitor
with
a
nod
and
wholly
friendly
and
propitiatory
brown
told
me
and
and
about
your
trouble
i
am
so
sorry
but
as
leslie
winced
i
wo
talk
of
that
i
see
that
you
have
some
tea
will
you
not
come
in
said
leslie
the
girl
came
into
the
room
timidly
and
took
the
chair
which
leslie
drew
forward
for
her
i
think
i
saw
you
in
the
hall
yesterday
she
said
you
are
a
lodger
like
myself
yes
oh
yes
replied
her
visitor
nodding
and
i
saw
you
i
asked
brown
who
you
were
and
she
told
me
i
hope
you
do
think
me
inquisitive
and
she
colored
timidly
no
oh
no
it
was
a
very
natural
question
said
leslie
will
you
tell
me
your
name
oh
yes
my
name
is
somes
lucy
somes
and
you
are
paying
a
visit
to
london
said
leslie
trying
to
interest
herself
in
this
pleasant
looking
girl
who
had
from
sheer
kindness
acted
as
the
landlady
substitute
a
visit
said
lucy
somes
doubtfully
well
scarcely
that
here
she
hesitated
on
business
but
i
must
not
keep
you
waiting
for
your
tea
my
tea
can
wait
until
brown
can
get
it
said
leslie
oh
but
i
am
going
to
get
it
for
you
unless
she
hesitated
but
encouraged
by
leslie
faint
smile
she
continued
unless
you
mind
coming
down
to
my
room
and
taking
tea
with
me
i
have
just
got
mine
and
i
should
be
so
pleased
if
you
would
come
leslie
did
not
respond
for
a
moment
or
two
trouble
makes
solitude
very
dear
to
us
but
she
fought
against
the
desire
to
decline
thank
you
she
said
simply
i
shall
be
very
pleased
lucy
jumped
up
come
along
then
she
said
with
evident
pleasure
leslie
followed
her
downstairs
and
lucy
somes
ushered
her
into
the
tiny
room
which
served
for
bedroom
and
sitting
room
i
hope
you
do
mind
said
lucy
with
a
sudden
blush
on
her
pleasant
face
but
you
see
i
am
not
rich
enough
to
afford
two
rooms
and
so
why
should
i
mind
said
leslie
in
her
gentle
voice
oh
i
can
see
you
have
been
used
to
something
better
than
this
said
lucy
bustling
to
and
fro
as
she
spoke
and
adding
another
cup
and
saucer
and
plate
to
the
tea
things
on
the
small
table
i
laughed
to
myself
when
brown
said
you
were
a
real
lady
persons
like
her
make
such
mistakes
but
i
see
that
she
was
right
but
a
lady
does
not
contemn
poverty
does
she
and
she
laughed
as
she
cut
some
bread
and
butter
especially
when
she
is
poor
herself
thought
leslie
but
she
only
smiled
and
so
i
thought
i
would
venture
to
intrude
upon
you
continued
lucy
somes
i
was
half
afraid
for
you
looked
so
so
i
want
a
word
it
is
proud
so
aristocratic
and
reserved
i
say
that
i
quite
trembled
and
it
was
only
by
saying
is
only
a
girl
and
no
older
than
yourself
and
all
alone
and
in
trouble
that
i
plucked
up
courage
to
go
up
to
you
am
i
so
very
terrible
said
leslie
with
the
smile
that
all
portmaris
and
yorke
had
found
so
irresistible
not
now
when
you
look
like
that
replied
lucy
somes
but
when
you
are
grave
and
solemn
as
you
were
when
you
passed
by
me
yesterday
you
are
very
very
will
you
have
some
sugar
in
your
tea
i
made
some
toast
papa
she
stopped
suddenly
then
went
on
in
a
subdued
voice
papa
used
to
say
that
i
made
toast
better
than
any
of
the
others
he
is
dead
she
added
after
another
pause
and
leslie
saw
the
eyes
grow
dim
behind
the
spectacles
she
put
out
her
hand
and
laid
it
on
the
girl
arm
did
he
three
months
ago
said
lucy
somes
sadly
yet
cheerily
he
was
a
country
clergyman
down
in
wealdshire
he
caught
a
fever
visiting
a
parishioner
there
are
seven
of
us
and
mother
i
the
second
she
poured
out
the
tea
while
she
was
speaking
and
was
obviously
fighting
with
her
tears
seven
of
us
just
fancy
poor
mother
did
know
what
to
do
so
i
came
up
to
london
to
fight
my
way
in
the
world
and
i
mean
to
fight
it
too
what
awful
stuff
the
london
butter
is
is
it
i
do
believe
there
is
a
particle
of
cow
milk
in
it
do
you
seven
of
us
three
boys
and
four
girls
and
we
as
poor
as
poor
can
be
wo
you
take
some
milk
if
one
can
call
it
milk
and
you
are
going
to
fight
the
world
said
leslie
with
tender
sympathy
for
this
young
girl
who
could
be
so
cheerful
under
such
circumstances
what
are
you
going
to
do
lucy
somes
laughed
as
she
put
a
fresh
piece
of
toast
on
the
rack
i
going
to
be
a
governess
a
governess
said
leslie
in
a
gentleman
family
lucy
somes
shook
her
head
emphatically
oh
no
thank
you
i
know
what
that
means
six
young
children
to
teach
all
the
mending
to
do
and
heaps
of
other
things
for
twenty
pounds
a
year
less
than
they
give
their
cook
no
no
i
am
going
to
be
the
mistress
of
one
of
the
country
schools
yes
said
leslie
vaguely
yes
i
am
going
to
try
and
get
the
mistressship
of
a
board
or
voluntary
school
in
some
country
place
i
could
live
in
london
i
do
seem
as
if
i
could
breathe
here
every
morning
i
wake
and
fancy
i
have
been
shut
up
in
a
coal
mine
did
you
ever
notice
how
the
smuts
come
into
the
room
when
you
open
the
window
and
that
what
london
folks
breathe
all
the
time
it
does
not
seem
to
disagree
with
them
said
leslie
with
a
faint
smile
it
disagrees
with
me
retorted
lucy
laughing
oh
no
no
give
me
the
country
with
plenty
of
space
to
move
about
and
the
flowers
and
the
birds
and
butter
that
is
manufactured
from
fat
and
milk
that
is
a
mixture
of
chalk
and
water
do
you
think
it
will
be
very
nice
to
be
the
mistress
of
a
school
in
some
pretty
village
there
is
always
a
nice
little
house
for
one
to
live
in
and
perhaps
i
could
afford
to
keep
a
young
girl
for
a
servant
and
and
be
able
to
save
some
money
to
send
to
mother
to
help
her
with
the
rest
of
us
leslie
listened
and
her
conscience
smote
her
here
was
this
girl
no
older
than
herself
alone
in
london
and
so
bravely
ready
to
fight
the
great
battle
thinking
little
of
herself
and
so
much
of
those
dear
ones
she
had
left
behind
of
course
i
am
rather
afraid
of
the
exams
went
on
lucy
knowing
somehow
that
the
best
thing
she
could
do
for
this
sweet
girl
was
to
talk
of
herself
and
so
coax
leslie
from
dwelling
on
her
own
sorrow
they
are
rather
dreadful
but
i
have
been
working
hard
and
i
think
i
shall
pass
i
show
you
some
of
my
books
shall
i
may
i
but
you
must
have
your
tea
first
quite
comfortably
it
was
so
kind
of
you
to
come
down
to
me
i
was
feeling
so
dreadfully
lonely
and
and
friendless
london
is
such
a
big
place
to
be
alone
in
is
it
ah
yes
said
leslie
i
tried
to
make
friends
with
the
sparrows
said
lucy
laughing
i
put
some
crumbs
on
the
as
breakfast
and
they
come
and
eat
them
but
they
are
not
like
the
country
sparrows
they
look
somehow
so
disreputable
i
suppose
it
because
they
sit
up
late
like
everybody
else
in
london
all
the
animals
are
different
the
very
horses
look
knowing
and
sharp
now
you
shall
sit
in
that
while
i
show
you
my
books
and
half
timidly
she
put
leslie
in
the
chair
and
arranged
a
cushion
for
her
as
if
she
were
a
great
invalid
leslie
tender
heart
melted
under
all
this
gentle
sunshine
and
when
lucy
kneeling
beside
her
opened
her
books
leslie
found
with
a
vague
kind
of
surprise
that
she
was
interested
you
see
it
is
a
great
many
subjects
to
get
up
is
it
but
i
not
afraid
i
should
get
on
faster
if
some
of
the
girls
were
here
to
hear
me
repeat
some
of
the
most
difficult
passages
and
if
papa
were
here
to
explain
things
i
do
quite
understand
he
was
so
clever
there
was
nothing
he
did
not
know
she
added
with
simple
loving
pride
let
me
see
said
leslie
taking
up
a
book
why
should
i
not
help
you
miss
somes
lucy
colored
furiously
oh
indeed
indeed
she
said
imploringly
i
did
not
mean
that
i
could
not
think
of
allowing
you
but
how
kind
of
you
to
offer
oh
no
no
but
the
kindness
will
be
on
your
part
if
you
will
let
me
try
and
be
of
some
help
said
leslie
with
gentle
insistence
i
too
am
all
alone
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
she
smothered
a
sigh
and
the
time
seems
very
long
and
weary
i
could
hear
you
repeat
what
you
have
learned
as
well
as
one
of
your
sisters
i
could
do
that
at
least
let
me
see
i
am
very
ignorant
you
will
soon
see
that
but
i
remember
something
of
this
book
i
had
it
at
school
lucy
would
not
hear
of
it
for
some
time
but
at
last
leslie
overcame
her
scruples
and
with
a
little
blush
repeated
some
of
the
paragraphs
she
had
got
off
by
heart
chapter
xxx
the
encounter
reading
for
an
exam
even
a
little
one
is
awful
work
if
it
were
only
one
or
two
subjects
which
one
had
to
master
it
would
not
be
so
bad
but
when
there
are
six
or
a
dozen
then
the
trouble
comes
in
as
fast
as
one
subject
is
learned
it
is
driven
out
of
its
place
in
the
memory
by
a
second
and
the
second
by
the
third
and
so
on
then
one
has
to
go
back
and
begin
all
over
again
until
they
all
get
mixed
up
and
one
feels
it
will
be
impossible
to
ever
get
them
properly
sorted
and
arranged
the
more
leslie
saw
of
this
girl
the
more
she
admired
and
wondered
at
her
patience
and
courage
they
lit
the
lamp
and
worked
through
the
evening
though
lucy
over
and
over
again
protested
that
it
was
both
wicked
and
cruel
to
take
advantage
of
leslie
good
nature
and
at
last
she
swept
all
the
books
together
and
declared
that
leslie
should
not
touch
another
but
if
you
knew
what
a
help
it
has
been
to
me
she
exclaimed
gratefully
and
to
me
said
leslie
with
a
smile
it
is
i
who
ought
to
be
grateful
and
indeed
i
am
for
i
should
have
been
sitting
upstairs
alone
with
nothing
to
do
but
think
think
ah
that
is
the
worst
of
it
said
lucy
gravely
that
is
why
i
am
so
glad
i
am
obliged
to
work
you
see
i
have
the
time
to
think
i
keep
on
and
on
like
the
man
who
climbed
the
alps
what
was
his
name
excelsior
the
next
morning
lucy
knocked
at
the
door
she
had
got
her
outdoor
clothes
on
and
had
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
her
hand
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
blushing
timidly
but
i
have
been
for
a
run
i
always
go
into
covent
garden
and
and
i
brought
some
flowers
i
thought
you
would
not
mind
would
not
think
it
intrusive
but
i
am
so
fond
of
flowers
myself
leslie
made
her
come
in
and
sit
down
while
she
got
a
glass
for
the
flowers
lucy
looked
round
and
saw
the
easel
leslie
had
put
the
pictures
out
of
sight
are
you
an
artist
miss
lisle
she
asked
timidly
no
oh
no
it
was
my
father
yes
yes
i
see
said
lucy
quickly
it
is
so
hard
to
paint
or
draw
is
it
that
is
where
i
shall
fail
i
expect
you
see
i
have
never
been
able
to
get
any
tuition
i
suppose
you
can
draw
yes
a
little
said
leslie
and
play
but
of
course
yes
said
leslie
lucy
sighed
not
enviously
but
admiringly
it
is
a
pity
that
it
is
not
you
who
are
going
up
for
the
exam
instead
of
me
it
would
be
so
easy
for
you
they
think
so
much
of
drawing
and
playing
and
accomplishments
generally
i
told
leslie
looked
at
her
you
think
i
i
could
pass
that
i
could
get
a
place
in
a
school
she
faltered
lucy
laughed
confidently
oh
yes
why
easily
but
you
do
not
want
it
fortunately
leslie
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
minute
then
she
took
out
her
purse
and
turned
the
money
out
on
the
table
that
is
all
i
have
in
the
world
she
said
with
a
quiet
smile
lucy
crimsoned
and
then
turned
pale
oh
i
i
beg
your
pardon
please
please
forgive
me
she
said
i
did
not
know
i
thought
that
i
was
a
princess
a
millionairess
said
leslie
smiling
no
as
you
see
i
am
very
poor
and
quite
quite
alone
i
would
give
something
for
a
mother
and
six
brothers
and
sisters
miss
somes
oh
do
call
me
lucy
lucy
implored
timidly
i
am
it
is
very
wicked
but
i
am
almost
glad
that
you
are
not
well
off
it
draws
us
nearer
and
and
you
will
not
mind
but
i
like
you
so
much
you
are
not
angry
leslie
bent
down
and
kissed
the
resolute
little
forehead
no
i
am
only
grateful
lucy
she
said
in
her
sweet
irresistible
way
we
two
who
are
alone
in
this
big
london
ought
to
cling
together
ought
we
not
you
must
call
me
leslie
and
try
and
think
that
i
am
one
of
your
sisters
that
wo
be
hard
responded
lucy
fervently
but
let
me
think
you
say
she
paused
oh
but
you
would
not
like
it
it
it
would
not
be
good
enough
what
would
not
be
good
enough
lucy
why
a
place
like
that
i
am
trying
for
said
lucy
timidly
leslie
sighed
it
would
be
too
good
to
hope
for
she
said
gently
lucy
sprang
up
eagerly
oh
that
is
nonsense
she
exclaimed
in
her
fashion
why
you
could
pass
easily
and
yes
i
see
it
as
plainly
as
possible
you
shall
go
in
for
the
exam
we
will
work
together
no
do
shake
your
head
we
should
both
stand
a
better
chance
if
we
tried
together
for
there
may
be
things
that
i
could
help
you
in
and
i
know
that
you
could
help
me
there
the
drawing
for
instance
oh
i
can
see
it
all
beautifully
and
only
think
leslie
perhaps
we
might
get
into
the
same
school
it
might
be
managed
mother
has
some
influence
for
poor
papa
people
are
well
known
and
can
help
us
once
we
have
passed
now
you
sha
say
anything
against
it
or
shake
your
head
wait
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
before
leslie
could
recover
from
the
varied
emotions
the
hope
the
fear
which
lucy
suggestion
had
aroused
lucy
was
back
with
her
books
and
papers
look
here
leslie
dear
she
exclaimed
panting
here
is
the
list
of
subjects
and
the
books
and
everything
and
we
will
start
at
once
yes
at
once
leslie
still
hesitated
but
lucy
drew
her
down
to
a
chair
beside
the
table
and
gently
forced
her
to
examine
the
papers
lucy
and
her
scheme
came
just
in
the
nick
of
time
and
once
leslie
had
commenced
she
worked
with
a
feverish
eagerness
which
lucy
declared
required
the
brake
i
was
just
like
that
myself
when
i
started
though
i
do
think
i
was
quite
as
bad
as
you
are
leslie
dear
but
you
soon
find
that
the
pace
is
too
fast
as
my
brothers
would
say
you
ca
keep
it
up
and
you
have
to
slow
off
into
regular
work
with
regular
rests
come
you
must
go
out
now
it
is
two
days
since
you
left
the
house
and
you
must
come
out
with
me
you
would
soon
break
down
if
you
kept
on
at
this
rate
leslie
put
down
the
book
she
was
working
at
reluctantly
and
with
a
sigh
i
am
not
tired
i
do
not
care
to
go
out
she
said
while
one
works
one
can
not
think
and
not
to
think
she
broke
off
and
turned
her
face
away
i
know
said
lucy
but
she
did
for
she
thought
leslie
was
only
trying
not
to
think
of
her
father
i
know
but
if
you
kept
on
driving
it
off
by
constant
working
you
would
find
that
you
would
get
no
sleep
and
lie
awake
all
night
and
think
and
that
is
worse
than
thinking
in
the
daytime
come
dear
we
will
go
for
a
nice
long
walk
and
come
back
fresh
to
the
tiresome
books
blessed
books
say
rather
said
leslie
but
she
went
and
put
on
her
outdoor
things
submissively
the
two
girls
had
by
this
time
entered
into
a
kind
of
partnership
fate
had
thrown
them
together
in
the
whirlpool
of
life
and
they
had
decided
to
cling
together
to
this
spar
the
chance
of
a
misstressship
in
a
country
school
and
to
sink
or
float
together
they
joined
housekeeping
and
ate
their
meals
together
and
worked
with
an
amity
and
friendliness
which
did
credit
to
both
their
hearts
leslie
was
the
quicker
brain
but
lucy
had
been
working
for
some
months
and
could
stick
to
her
task
with
a
dogged
perseverance
which
leslie
envied
whereas
lucy
regarded
leslie
with
an
admiration
and
affection
which
almost
amounted
to
worship
to
her
leslie
seemed
the
epitome
of
all
that
was
beautiful
and
sweet
and
graceful
and
if
leslie
had
permitted
it
lucy
would
have
become
a
kind
of
as
well
as
the
afternoon
was
a
hot
one
but
leslie
wore
her
veil
down
walking
along
with
absent
preoccupied
eyes
and
only
half
listening
to
the
bright
cheery
chatter
of
the
girl
at
her
side
after
all
london
is
not
bad
said
lucy
one
gets
fond
of
it
stupidly
fond
of
it
without
knowing
it
it
does
seem
so
hard
and
after
a
while
and
i
yes
i
really
think
it
is
more
friendly
than
the
country
the
shops
are
so
bright
and
cheerful
that
they
seem
to
smile
at
you
and
tell
you
to
cheer
up
and
then
the
noise
i
did
like
it
at
first
but
i
do
mind
it
so
much
now
it
seems
like
company
do
you
know
what
i
mean
leslie
yes
said
leslie
absently
she
was
thinking
of
what
yorke
had
said
about
london
and
how
good
it
was
to
get
away
from
it
where
was
he
now
she
wondered
yes
if
i
were
a
rich
woman
i
would
have
a
house
in
london
not
for
the
season
oh
no
fancy
all
rich
and
fashionable
people
leaving
the
dear
delicious
country
just
when
it
is
beginning
to
look
its
very
best
and
coming
up
here
into
the
hot
streets
and
stuffy
houses
though
the
parks
are
pretty
i
will
admit
that
no
i
would
come
up
when
the
days
draw
in
and
the
country
lanes
are
muddy
and
the
roads
dark
then
london
is
at
its
best
with
the
lighted
streets
and
the
theaters
and
the
warm
houses
yes
leslie
if
i
were
rich
she
laughed
how
strange
it
must
seem
to
anyone
who
becomes
suddenly
rich
one
hears
of
girls
marrying
wealthy
men
and
stepping
from
poverty
to
luxury
i
suppose
it
must
be
confusing
and
bewildering
at
first
at
least
to
most
girls
i
do
think
it
would
be
to
you
leslie
she
added
glancing
up
at
her
with
a
reflective
smile
i
think
if
you
were
to
marry
a
duke
you
would
take
it
quite
calmly
and
as
a
matter
of
course
somehow
when
i
am
looking
at
you
when
you
are
bending
over
the
books
or
better
still
when
you
are
standing
at
the
window
with
your
arms
folded
and
that
strange
look
in
your
eyes
i
think
what
a
pity
it
is
that
you
are
not
a
great
lady
you
are
so
tall
and
and
what
is
the
word
distingué
that
i
fancy
you
dressed
in
white
satin
with
a
long
train
and
hear
you
being
called
grace
leslie
bit
her
lip
i
am
not
distingué
or
so
foolish
as
to
believe
all
you
say
lucy
she
said
scarcely
knowing
what
she
said
for
the
aimless
chatter
had
set
her
heart
aching
not
for
the
loss
of
the
dukedom
but
the
man
where
are
we
lucy
laughed
with
a
gentle
triumph
if
i
do
know
half
so
much
of
other
things
as
you
do
i
know
london
better
she
said
we
are
coming
out
into
james
and
we
will
walk
into
the
park
and
through
pall
mall
and
then
take
a
bus
your
grace
leslie
stopped
and
laid
her
hand
on
lucy
arm
do
do
call
me
that
she
said
so
gravely
almost
sternly
that
lucy
looked
up
half
frightened
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
so
sorry
leslie
if
i
no
no
broke
in
leslie
ashamed
of
the
agitation
into
which
idle
badinage
had
thrown
her
call
me
what
you
like
dear
lucy
looked
up
at
her
timidly
and
wonderingly
and
was
silent
and
leslie
had
to
force
herself
to
talk
to
restore
her
companion
peace
of
mind
they
went
into
the
park
talking
of
the
future
and
their
chances
it
will
not
be
long
now
said
lucy
oh
how
i
long
for
the
day
when
we
shall
hold
those
certificates
in
our
hands
i
shall
be
so
proud
and
glad
that
i
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
contain
myself
i
shall
have
to
telegraph
to
mother
it
will
cost
eighteenpence
for
they
are
two
miles
from
the
telegraph
office
but
i
do
care
and
you
wire
too
leslie
leslie
shook
her
head
i
have
no
one
to
tell
she
said
at
least
i
shall
save
the
eighteenpence
and
she
smiled
gravely
you
will
have
me
at
any
rate
murmured
lucy
gently
and
leslie
pressed
her
hand
gratefully
they
wandered
in
the
park
what
a
host
of
memories
it
calls
up
to
him
who
knows
his
history
of
london
that
same
park
until
the
twilight
came
and
then
turned
homewards
as
they
passed
down
pall
mall
they
met
the
broughams
and
cabs
rolling
home
to
the
west
and
lucy
regarding
them
with
a
pleasant
interest
remarked
they
are
all
going
home
it
is
their
dinnertime
see
some
of
the
women
are
in
evening
dress
yes
it
must
be
nice
to
be
rich
and
great
but
we
are
happy
we
two
are
we
not
leslie
dear
yes
said
leslie
and
she
tried
to
speak
the
word
cheerfully
these
are
the
famous
clubs
are
they
not
said
lucy
looking
up
at
the
stately
buildings
through
the
windows
of
which
the
lights
were
beginning
to
glimmer
yes
said
leslie
how
strange
it
seems
that
there
should
be
so
many
people
who
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
who
have
never
worked
and
who
have
so
much
money
as
to
find
it
a
nuisance
while
others
have
to
work
every
day
of
their
lives
and
all
their
lives
and
have
never
a
spare
penny
look
leslie
there
are
some
gentlemen
going
into
that
club
i
suppose
it
is
a
club
how
grand
and
nice
they
look
in
their
evening
dress
it
must
be
nice
to
be
a
rich
gentleman
instead
of
she
broke
off
suddenly
alarmed
by
a
sharp
cry
that
seemed
to
force
itself
through
leslie
lips
they
had
come
within
a
few
yards
of
the
club
into
which
the
men
lucy
had
noticed
had
disappeared
and
leslie
absent
preoccupied
eyes
had
fallen
upon
another
man
who
was
coming
towards
them
he
was
a
tall
man
with
broad
shoulders
but
he
was
walking
with
a
slow
listless
gait
and
his
head
was
bent
as
if
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
where
he
was
going
leslie
knew
him
in
a
moment
it
was
yorke
and
yet
could
it
be
could
this
listless
man
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
light
overcoat
pocket
with
his
drooping
head
be
yorke
with
the
straight
broad
shoulders
the
figure
upright
as
a
dart
the
head
the
handsome
face
with
its
cheerful
look
in
the
bright
eyes
oh
surely
not
yorke
not
her
yorke
as
she
remembered
him
in
the
street
at
portmaris
on
the
beach
beside
her
on
the
tower
at
martin
after
that
one
cry
she
made
no
sign
but
drew
back
a
step
so
that
lucy
could
screen
her
from
him
if
he
chanced
to
look
up
he
came
towards
them
like
a
man
walking
in
a
dream
and
as
he
reached
their
side
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
them
leslie
had
hard
work
to
keep
the
cry
that
rose
in
her
heart
from
escaping
her
lips
it
was
yorke
face
but
how
changed
how
weary
and
sad
and
hopeless
and
yes
reckless
there
was
that
in
the
dark
eyes
which
she
an
innocent
girl
did
not
understand
but
instinctively
a
pang
went
through
her
heart
and
she
trembled
she
knew
not
why
his
eyes
with
that
strange
awful
look
in
them
rested
on
their
faces
for
a
moment
then
dropped
again
and
he
passed
on
he
went
up
the
steps
of
the
club
but
turned
and
stood
just
outside
the
door
and
leslie
almost
sinking
with
agitation
hurried
on
what
is
the
matter
leslie
dear
you
frighten
me
said
lucy
are
you
ill
no
yes
said
leslie
she
walked
swiftly
and
yet
tremblingly
up
a
side
street
and
stood
there
out
of
the
reach
of
those
eyes
shaking
like
a
leaf
you
are
ill
said
lucy
catching
her
arm
we
have
walked
too
far
you
are
tired
oh
what
is
it
dear
yes
i
am
tired
said
leslie
when
she
could
command
her
voice
that
is
it
we
we
must
have
a
cab
stay
not
here
come
farther
up
the
street
lucy
called
a
cab
and
leslie
sank
back
her
hands
clasped
tightly
her
face
white
as
death
behind
her
veil
you
frighten
me
leslie
said
lucy
holding
her
hand
and
you
look
so
frightened
yourself
what
is
it
dear
you
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
ghost
yes
said
leslie
but
in
so
low
a
voice
that
lucy
could
not
hear
her
yes
i
have
seen
a
ghost
yorke
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
club
with
downcast
face
and
moody
eyes
for
some
half
minute
then
the
eyes
lit
up
with
a
sombre
light
and
going
down
the
steps
he
crossed
the
road
and
laid
his
hand
sharply
on
the
shoulder
of
a
man
who
was
lounging
against
a
post
the
man
looked
up
but
he
did
not
appear
surprised
you
watching
me
said
yorke
and
his
voice
matched
his
face
it
was
hard
and
stern
you
have
been
watching
me
for
the
last
two
days
do
trouble
to
deny
it
the
man
whose
appearance
was
like
that
of
a
respectable
servant
out
of
livery
a
butler
out
of
place
for
instance
touched
his
hat
lord
auchester
i
think
sir
he
said
coolly
yet
not
disrespectfully
you
know
my
name
well
enough
said
yorke
a
little
less
sternly
as
if
he
were
too
weary
to
be
resentful
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
i
have
seen
you
following
me
for
the
last
two
days
why
do
you
do
it
what
is
it
the
man
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
just
touched
yorke
arm
with
his
finger
as
if
he
were
going
through
some
form
i
am
a
sheriff
officer
my
lord
he
said
and
this
is
my
writ
yorke
looked
at
him
and
at
the
paper
what
writ
he
said
not
angrily
but
with
obvious
indifference
a
matter
of
five
bills
overdue
my
lord
judgment
has
been
signed
a
week
ago
yorke
shook
his
head
you
might
as
well
talk
arabic
my
man
he
said
listlessly
i
know
nothing
about
the
law
certainly
not
my
lord
said
the
man
as
if
he
would
not
insult
his
lordship
by
suggesting
such
knowledge
it
is
to
be
expected
but
your
lordship
has
had
the
former
summonses
yorke
shook
his
head
delivered
at
you
rooms
at
bury
street
my
lord
i
see
said
yorke
he
had
not
opened
a
letter
that
looked
like
a
business
one
since
since
the
hour
he
had
learnt
that
leslie
had
jilted
him
i
see
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
only
to
go
home
my
lord
and
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
court
you
know
i
do
know
said
yorke
why
have
you
watched
me
well
my
lord
we
had
information
in
fact
we
sworn
it
that
you
intended
leaving
the
country
i
did
said
yorke
just
so
my
lord
and
i
was
keeping
my
eye
on
you
i
could
have
arrested
you
it
a
city
process
if
you
attempted
to
leave
one
of
the
english
ports
yorke
smiled
grimly
you
must
have
had
some
trouble
he
said
the
man
smiled
and
nodded
indeed
i
have
my
lord
you
nearly
walked
me
off
my
legs
i
never
shadowed
such
a
restless
gentleman
begging
your
lordship
pardon
i
must
have
walked
oh
law
knows
how
many
miles
following
you
and
a
wonder
to
me
we
ai
both
knocked
up
yorke
gave
him
a
sovereign
go
home
he
said
you
need
follow
me
no
longer
i
will
attend
the
court
wherever
it
is
stop
what
is
the
name
of
the
man
who
does
all
this
the
man
i
owe
the
money
to
ralph
duncombe
my
lord
yorke
repeated
the
name
vacantly
i
do
know
him
i
never
heard
of
him
he
said
but
it
does
not
matter
i
owe
a
great
many
persons
money
and
he
may
be
one
of
them
and
he
walked
away
his
head
down
again
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
man
looked
after
him
with
a
puzzled
countenance
and
turned
over
the
sovereign
yorke
had
given
him
one
of
the
right
sort
he
is
he
muttered
but
ai
he
down
on
his
luck
i
seen
a
good
many
of
in
queer
street
but
none
of
looked
half
so
bad
as
that
if
i
was
his
friends
i
should
take
his
razors
away
yorke
reached
bury
street
but
before
he
could
ring
the
door
opened
and
fleming
with
a
scared
face
stood
before
him
oh
my
lord
he
began
better
not
come
up
go
to
the
club
my
lord
and
i
bring
your
things
yorke
put
him
aside
gently
and
went
slowly
up
the
stairs
a
man
own
brother
in
appearance
to
the
man
in
the
street
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
he
got
up
as
yorke
entered
and
touched
his
forehead
well
said
yorke
i
the
man
in
possession
my
lord
said
the
man
respectfully
enough
chapter
xxxi
cleaned
out
a
man
in
possession
yorke
looked
at
him
half
vacantly
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
stop
here
he
said
that
you
have
got
to
stop
here
yes
my
lord
i
sorry
to
say
said
the
man
somebody
got
to
be
here
to
see
that
none
of
the
things
is
removed
fleming
standing
behind
his
master
groaned
yorke
turned
to
him
quite
coolly
give
the
man
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
make
him
comfortable
he
ca
help
it
poor
devil
bring
me
some
cigars
and
my
letters
into
the
he
sat
down
and
lighted
a
cigar
and
opened
the
letters
which
had
been
lying
disregarded
for
weeks
and
as
he
looked
through
them
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
worse
mess
than
he
had
ever
before
been
all
his
other
money
troubles
were
trifles
and
child
play
compared
with
this
there
was
not
a
worse
business
man
in
london
than
yorke
and
he
did
not
understand
half
the
legal
documents
the
summonses
the
orders
of
the
court
which
he
opened
and
stared
at
but
the
prominence
and
frequency
of
one
name
in
the
whole
business
struck
him
who
on
earth
is
ralph
duncombe
he
asked
himself
levison
i
know
and
moses
arack
i
know
and
this
man
and
this
i
remember
having
money
from
them
but
ralph
duncombe
no
he
could
not
recall
the
man
name
but
after
all
it
did
not
matter
it
was
evident
that
his
creditors
had
all
combined
to
swoop
down
upon
him
at
once
and
the
avalanche
would
crush
him
unless
he
got
some
help
and
where
should
he
turn
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
borrow
money
through
the
usual
channels
no
doubt
the
news
that
he
was
going
to
marry
a
penniless
girl
instead
of
the
rich
heiress
lady
eleanor
dallas
had
leaked
out
and
all
the
who
hung
together
like
bees
would
refuse
to
lend
him
a
silver
sixpence
dolph
he
almost
started
at
the
thought
of
him
for
two
days
ago
the
duke
who
had
been
seriously
ill
had
started
for
the
continent
and
yorke
did
not
even
know
in
which
direction
for
to
tell
the
truth
yorke
had
avoided
the
duke
and
every
other
friend
and
acquaintance
since
the
day
he
had
been
convinced
that
leslie
had
thrown
him
over
no
doubt
the
duke
would
lend
him
the
money
would
give
him
twice
as
much
as
was
necessary
though
the
was
a
large
one
but
the
money
must
be
forthcoming
at
once
the
man
had
said
he
would
have
to
appear
in
the
court
in
the
city
or
was
it
the
next
day
good
heavens
appear
as
a
common
defaulter
in
a
public
court
he
smiled
grimly
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
felt
in
the
humor
he
was
then
in
that
he
did
not
care
a
button
what
became
of
him
when
you
have
reached
the
point
at
which
life
is
a
burden
and
a
nuisance
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
are
ruined
or
not
but
there
were
other
people
to
think
of
there
was
dolph
and
lord
eustace
and
all
his
other
relatives
how
would
they
take
it
when
they
opened
their
newspapers
and
read
of
the
appearance
of
lord
yorke
auchester
cousin
of
the
duke
of
rothbury
in
a
debtors
court
in
the
city
lord
eustace
who
was
always
talking
of
his
would
have
a
fit
now
most
men
would
have
gone
to
a
lawyer
but
yorke
knew
that
it
would
be
of
little
or
no
use
troubling
a
lawyer
with
this
business
what
was
wanted
was
money
and
no
lawyer
would
lend
it
to
him
without
security
and
as
for
security
why
there
was
already
a
man
in
possession
of
the
few
things
he
owned
in
this
transitory
world
fleming
knocked
at
the
door
and
in
answer
to
a
cold
come
in
entered
did
you
ring
my
lord
he
said
you
know
i
did
said
yorke
what
is
it
you
look
upset
fleming
and
he
smiled
the
smile
which
is
not
good
to
see
on
the
lips
of
any
man
young
or
old
simple
or
gentle
beg
pardon
my
lord
said
fleming
who
was
genuinely
attached
to
his
master
and
who
had
watched
the
change
in
him
with
sincere
grief
and
regret
but
i
thought
you
would
want
to
send
me
somewhere
perhaps
yorke
smiled
the
best
thing
i
could
do
for
you
would
be
to
send
you
about
your
business
he
said
oh
do
say
that
my
lord
remonstrated
fleming
i
i
afraid
something
is
wrong
my
lord
yes
said
yorke
grimly
something
is
very
much
wrong
fleming
the
fact
is
i
am
up
a
tree
cleaned
out
and
ruined
ruined
that
it
assented
yorke
coolly
i
been
hard
up
once
or
twice
before
you
know
that
fleming
oh
yes
my
lord
but
this
is
the
finale
the
climax
the
wind
up
but
do
let
me
stand
in
your
light
look
here
you
have
been
a
deuced
good
servant
yes
and
a
friend
to
me
and
as
it
wo
do
you
any
good
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
beastly
mess
you
had
better
go
at
once
lord
vinson
has
often
told
me
that
if
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
you
he
be
glad
to
take
you
on
so
you
go
to
him
i
give
you
a
letter
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
exemplary
life
fleming
was
guilty
of
vulgar
language
i
damned
if
i
do
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
i
humbly
beg
your
lordship
pardon
but
i
not
that
kind
of
a
man
i
not
indeed
and
there
was
something
very
much
like
water
in
the
honest
fellow
eyes
i
should
think
of
leaving
your
lordship
while
you
were
up
a
tree
as
your
lordship
puts
it
i
should
never
look
myself
in
the
face
again
i
much
obliged
to
lord
vinson
but
no
my
lord
not
the
man
to
desert
a
good
and
kind
master
in
misfortune
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
but
i
thought
he
hesitated
respectfully
think
away
said
yorke
lighting
another
cigar
and
tilting
his
hat
back
perhaps
your
thinking
will
be
more
valuable
than
mine
i
been
thinking
and
can
see
no
way
out
of
the
mess
the
the
duke
my
lord
suggested
fleming
i
sure
he
so
am
i
fleming
but
the
duke
has
left
for
the
continent
and
i
know
where
he
has
gone
and
this
paper
says
that
i
got
to
show
up
at
the
court
in
the
city
at
once
and
it
will
all
be
in
the
newspapers
said
fleming
aghast
to
be
the
newspapers
was
the
direct
disgrace
and
calamity
in
the
eyes
of
that
worthy
man
just
so
said
yorke
knocking
the
ashes
off
his
cigar
you
see
fleming
i
am
in
a
hole
out
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
pull
me
never
you
mind
after
all
it
does
matter
does
it
matter
my
lord
echoed
fleming
startled
you
you
who
are
so
well
known
to
to
appear
in
court
and
get
six
months
is
it
six
months
or
six
weeks
i
do
know
i
do
know
anything
but
i
suppose
i
shall
and
pretty
quickly
never
mind
look
here
see
that
man
in
the
next
room
has
all
he
wants
oh
yes
all
right
my
lord
said
fleming
with
a
touch
of
impatience
all
he
wants
is
beer
and
i
given
him
half
a
dozen
bottles
yorke
laughed
and
leaned
back
in
the
chair
all
right
bring
any
letters
that
may
come
i
should
like
to
know
the
worst
fleming
went
out
but
appeared
again
in
a
few
minutes
will
you
want
me
for
half
an
hour
or
my
lord
he
said
in
a
thoughtful
troubled
kind
of
way
no
going
after
that
place
fleming
better
fleming
colored
and
opened
his
lips
but
he
did
not
say
anything
and
yorke
left
alone
again
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
gave
himself
up
to
gloomy
reverie
a
man
in
possession
in
the
next
room
a
summons
to
appear
in
a
debtors
court
his
name
in
the
newspapers
as
a
ruined
man
it
was
all
bad
enough
but
he
scarcely
felt
it
he
had
endured
the
maximum
of
suffering
when
he
had
become
convinced
that
leslie
had
jilted
him
and
this
well
this
was
so
to
speak
almost
a
relief
and
a
diversion
and
yet
the
disgrace
he
passed
a
very
bad
half
hour
in
that
a
half
hour
in
which
there
rose
the
specter
of
an
past
in
which
follies
marched
in
ghostly
procession
before
him
and
all
as
they
promenaded
by
whispered
hoarsely
ruin
and
yet
through
it
all
he
saw
more
plainly
than
anything
else
the
sweet
face
of
leslie
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
the
woman
who
had
seemed
to
him
an
angel
of
truth
and
constancy
but
who
had
deserted
him
the
moment
she
had
heard
that
he
was
not
a
duke
fleming
meanwhile
had
put
on
his
hat
and
sallied
into
the
street
he
had
left
his
beloved
master
utterly
reckless
and
indifferent
and
therefore
it
rested
with
him
the
devoted
servant
to
display
all
the
more
energy
that
he
should
sit
still
and
see
lord
yorke
drift
into
utter
ruin
and
destruction
was
simply
impossible
something
got
to
be
done
he
said
to
himself
and
i
got
to
do
it
he
is
going
to
appear
at
any
court
not
if
i
know
it
what
my
the
cousin
of
a
duke
to
come
up
before
a
beak
some
miserable
city
alderman
fleming
ideas
of
the
city
law
courts
were
like
his
master
hazy
certainly
not
not
if
i
have
to
move
heaven
and
earth
now
if
the
duke
was
at
home
i
could
see
grey
and
we
could
arrange
this
little
matter
between
us
but
as
he
is
why
the
thing
to
do
is
to
go
to
the
next
person
and
that
is
naturally
lady
eleanor
dallas
it
is
likely
that
she
see
lord
yorke
in
such
a
hole
as
this
without
helping
him
out
and
she
rich
and
richer
than
ever
lately
i
try
her
he
called
a
hansom
and
had
himself
driven
to
kensington
palace
gardens
anyhow
her
ladyship
can
only
refuse
to
see
me
he
said
to
himself
but
i
do
think
she
will
and
he
winked
the
other
eye
oh
my
friends
do
you
think
our
servants
are
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
they
know
all
our
little
secrets
and
our
little
difficulties
all
our
little
entanglements
there
is
scarcely
a
letter
we
receive
that
unless
we
lock
it
up
securely
they
do
not
read
no
friend
ever
visits
us
but
they
know
all
about
him
and
his
and
whom
his
daughter
is
engaged
to
or
why
the
engagement
is
broken
off
therefore
let
us
be
grateful
to
a
kind
providence
for
the
servants
who
are
also
devoted
and
trusty
friends
such
as
was
fleming
when
fleming
reached
kensington
palace
gardens
he
was
told
by
one
of
the
footmen
that
lady
eleanor
was
engaged
you
come
with
a
message
from
lord
auchester
fleming
i
suppose
said
the
footman
fleming
was
an
servant
and
was
always
addressed
by
those
beneath
him
as
and
he
was
very
much
respected
on
his
own
account
as
one
who
had
saved
money
and
was
in
society
well
no
i
have
said
fleming
gravely
and
a
little
pompously
i
come
on
business
of
my
own
the
footman
took
his
name
into
the
boudoir
where
lady
eleanor
was
sitting
with
no
other
than
ralph
duncombe
she
flushed
slightly
it
is
lord
auchester
valet
she
said
ralph
duncombe
looked
up
with
a
slight
start
i
do
not
wish
him
to
see
me
lady
eleanor
he
said
no
no
oh
no
i
understand
she
said
nervously
and
yet
i
should
like
to
know
what
he
has
to
say
lady
eleanor
pointed
to
a
large
japanese
screen
which
cut
off
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
he
will
not
be
here
many
minutes
she
said
ralph
duncombe
went
behind
the
screen
and
lady
eleanor
rang
the
bell
and
told
the
footman
she
would
see
fleming
he
came
in
looking
rather
nervous
and
embarrassed
for
it
was
a
bold
thing
he
was
going
to
do
and
he
knew
that
lady
eleanor
could
look
and
speak
haughtily
and
sternly
when
she
was
displeased
you
want
to
see
me
fleming
she
said
graciously
enough
is
it
a
message
from
lord
auchester
no
my
lady
he
said
and
like
a
man
of
the
world
he
went
straight
to
the
point
no
my
lady
his
lordship
does
not
know
that
i
have
come
and
if
he
had
known
i
was
coming
i
sure
he
would
have
forbidden
me
but
i
ventured
to
intrude
on
your
ladyship
knowing
that
you
and
my
master
were
old
friends
if
i
may
say
so
certainly
you
may
say
so
fleming
said
lady
eleanor
pleasantly
and
looking
as
if
she
were
expecting
anything
but
bad
news
well
my
lady
my
master
is
in
a
terrible
trouble
he
said
plunging
still
further
into
the
business
in
terrible
trouble
echoed
lady
eleanor
and
her
face
flushed
what
do
you
mean
fleming
it
money
matters
my
lady
said
fleming
gravely
and
looking
around
as
if
he
feared
an
eavesdropper
his
lordship
i
obliged
to
speak
freely
my
lady
or
else
you
wo
understand
but
it
out
of
no
disrespect
to
his
lordship
who
has
been
the
best
of
masters
to
me
say
what
you
have
to
say
quite
without
reserve
said
lady
eleanor
in
a
low
voice
well
my
lady
i
was
going
to
say
that
his
lordship
has
always
been
hard
up
as
you
may
say
there
always
been
a
difficulty
with
the
money
it
usual
with
gentlemen
like
lord
yorke
he
said
apologetically
they
do
know
and
ca
be
expected
to
know
the
value
of
money
like
common
ordinary
folk
and
so
they
well
they
outrun
the
constable
lord
auchester
is
in
debt
said
lady
eleanor
guardedly
it
worse
than
that
my
lady
said
fleming
that
would
be
nothing
for
ever
since
i
been
in
his
service
he
has
been
in
debt
but
now
the
people
he
owes
money
to
want
him
to
pay
them
he
gave
the
information
as
though
it
were
the
most
extraordinary
and
unnatural
conduct
on
the
part
of
any
creditor
of
lord
auchester
that
he
should
want
payment
people
who
owe
money
must
pay
it
some
time
fleming
suggested
lady
eleanor
yes
ah
yes
my
lady
some
time
admitted
fleming
but
not
all
at
once
it
seems
as
if
the
people
my
lord
owes
money
to
had
joined
together
and
resolved
to
drop
upon
him
in
a
heap
there
a
man
in
possession
in
bury
street
my
lady
a
man
in
possession
repeated
lady
eleanor
as
if
she
scarcely
understood
yes
a
bailiff
my
lady
sitting
there
in
his
lordship
and
i
dares
throw
him
out
of
the
window
lady
eleanor
looked
down
and
and
lord
yorke
fleming
i
suppose
he
is
in
great
trouble
about
this
fleming
hesitated
well
my
lady
he
is
in
great
trouble
but
if
you
mean
is
he
cut
up
about
this
money
matter
i
ca
say
that
he
is
he
do
seem
to
care
one
bit
about
it
and
takes
it
as
cool
and
indifferent
as
if
well
as
if
nothing
mattered
but
he
is
in
great
trouble
for
all
that
and
he
has
been
for
weeks
past
he
hesitated
lady
eleanor
looked
up
you
had
better
tell
me
everything
i
think
fleming
she
said
in
a
low
voice
well
my
lady
it
just
thus
his
lordship
had
a
blow
a
disappointment
of
some
kind
it
is
money
it
is
betting
or
or
i
should
have
heard
of
it
for
his
lordship
generally
makes
some
remarks
such
as
had
a
good
day
fleming
or
stone
broke
fleming
so
that
i
know
what
kind
of
luck
he
had
it
is
that
it
something
worse
if
there
is
anything
worse
he
put
in
philosophically
a
little
while
ago
his
lordship
was
in
the
very
best
of
spirits
i
never
saw
him
in
better
and
he
a
gentleman
as
you
know
my
lady
i
speaking
of
the
time
when
he
came
back
from
that
place
in
the
country
where
he
and
his
grace
the
duke
were
portmaris
lady
eleanor
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
so
that
her
face
was
hidden
from
him
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
change
came
and
his
lordship
got
bad
very
bad
it
was
dreadful
to
see
him
my
lady
eat
nothing
cared
for
nothing
scarcely
even
spoke
nothing
but
smoke
smoke
all
day
and
wander
in
and
out
looking
like
the
ghost
of
himself
and
he
who
used
to
be
so
bright
and
cheerful
with
the
laugh
always
ready
i
have
given
something
to
have
spoken
a
word
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
but
well
my
lady
with
all
his
pleasantness
my
master
the
last
gentleman
to
take
a
liberty
with
you
do
know
what
it
was
this
terrible
disappointment
said
lady
eleanor
almost
inaudibly
fleming
hesitated
and
glanced
at
her
then
he
coughed
discreetly
behind
his
hand
it
was
sufficient
answer
and
lady
eleanor
face
grew
red
whatever
it
was
that
made
him
so
happy
and
cheerful
it
was
knocked
on
the
head
and
put
an
end
to
my
lady
he
said
and
so
it
is
that
this
regular
of
affairs
i
mean
these
summonses
and
man
in
possession
do
seem
to
affect
him
you
see
my
lady
he
was
as
low
down
as
he
could
be
already
sometimes
he
stopped
and
looked
down
at
the
carpet
very
gravely
and
anxiously
well
well
my
lady
it
is
for
me
to
say
such
a
thing
but
i
been
almost
afraid
to
let
him
out
of
my
sight
in
the
morning
and
i
been
truly
thankful
to
see
him
come
in
at
night
lady
eleanor
drew
a
long
breath
and
shuddered
you
mean
men
when
they
down
as
low
as
my
master
they
do
rash
things
sometimes
my
lady
said
fleming
in
a
solemn
whisper
lady
eleanor
face
went
white
and
she
put
her
hand
to
her
delicate
throat
as
if
she
were
suffocating
you
you
should
not
say
hint
at
such
terrible
things
fleming
she
panted
i
i
beg
your
ladyship
pardon
he
said
humbly
but
it
the
truth
and
and
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
being
his
lordship
friend
yes
yes
i
am
his
friend
she
said
as
if
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
saying
and
i
will
try
to
help
him
fleming
face
brightened
oh
my
lady
he
said
gratefully
stop
she
said
your
master
lord
yorke
must
not
know
and
her
face
grew
crimson
again
oh
no
no
my
lady
certainly
not
why
if
his
lordship
ever
knew
that
i
come
to
you
he
stopped
and
shook
his
head
i
understand
said
lady
eleanor
no
lord
yorke
must
never
know
no
one
must
know
i
should
have
gone
to
the
duke
my
lady
but
his
grace
is
abroad
as
no
doubt
your
ladyship
knows
lady
eleanor
turned
her
head
aside
she
and
ralph
duncombe
had
timed
the
attack
on
yorke
for
the
moment
when
the
duke
should
be
beyond
reach
his
grace
would
have
helped
my
master
i
know
and
i
have
made
bold
to
write
to
him
but
there
is
time
lady
eleanor
shook
her
head
no
no
she
said
he
must
not
know
no
one
must
know
you
need
not
be
anxious
any
longer
fleming
you
were
right
in
coming
to
me
and
and
she
sunk
into
the
chair
fleming
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
very
well
my
lady
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
the
person
who
seems
the
principal
in
this
set
upon
his
lordship
is
a
man
named
duncombe
a
i
expect
they
take
all
sorts
of
names
i
wish
i
had
him
to
myself
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
teach
him
to
put
a
man
in
possession
begging
your
ladyship
pardon
he
broke
off
lady
eleanor
face
reddened
and
she
glanced
toward
the
screen
you
had
better
go
back
now
fleming
she
said
and
and
do
leave
lord
auchester
more
than
you
can
help
and
remember
not
one
word
that
might
lead
him
to
guess
that
you
have
been
to
me
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
be
careful
for
my
own
sake
my
lady
said
fleming
with
quiet
emphasis
and
with
a
bow
in
which
gratitude
and
respect
were
fairly
divided
he
left
the
room
ralph
duncombe
came
from
behind
the
screen
and
stood
looking
down
at
lady
eleanor
whose
proud
head
was
bowed
upon
her
hands
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
she
looked
up
set
him
free
at
once
at
once
she
responded
with
feverish
impetuosity
did
you
not
hear
the
man
that
he
actually
feared
his
master
would
she
shuddered
this
must
come
to
an
end
at
once
it
will
drive
him
mad
ralph
duncombe
smiled
grimly
i
heard
the
man
say
that
it
was
not
the
money
trouble
that
was
affecting
lord
auchester
he
said
it
seems
to
me
lady
eleanor
that
we
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
nothing
this
marriage
which
you
so
much
dreaded
was
broken
off
before
any
plans
to
prevent
it
were
put
in
operation
the
the
young
lady
had
disappeared
she
looked
up
suddenly
as
he
stopped
and
bit
his
lip
disappeared
how
do
you
know
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
his
face
was
as
pale
as
hers
but
was
set
and
stern
well
i
thought
i
had
better
run
down
to
this
place
portmaris
and
see
for
myself
how
matters
were
going
he
said
in
a
kind
of
coolness
and
indifference
and
and
i
found
that
miss
what
is
her
name
he
asked
as
if
he
had
forgotten
lisle
leslie
lisle
said
lady
eleanor
ah
yes
miss
lisle
had
flown
flown
yes
flown
and
disappeared
disappeared
so
completely
that
all
my
efforts
to
discover
her
track
failed
he
still
spoke
calmly
and
with
affected
indifference
but
if
she
herself
had
not
been
so
agitated
she
would
have
noticed
the
pallor
of
his
face
and
the
restless
movement
of
his
hands
what
what
do
you
think
it
means
she
asked
in
a
whisper
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
lovers
quarrel
but
no
it
is
more
shame
than
that
yes
i
should
say
that
the
engagement
was
broken
off
for
some
reason
or
other
so
that
you
have
had
all
this
trouble
and
expense
for
nothing
lady
eleanor
and
you
can
not
find
her
disappeared
he
took
up
his
hat
disappeared
he
repeated
grimly
and
that
is
why
he
is
wretched
and
unhappy
she
said
with
a
sigh
how
how
he
must
love
her
after
all
and
her
head
drooped
ralph
duncombe
moistened
his
lips
yes
he
said
but
perhaps
she
did
not
care
for
him
any
way
you
see
it
is
she
who
has
left
him
not
he
who
has
left
her
yes
she
said
and
she
pushed
the
hair
from
her
fair
forehead
with
an
impatient
gesture
oh
i
can
not
understand
it
the
engagement
broken
off
disappeared
but
there
must
be
an
end
to
these
law
proceedings
now
mr
duncombe
there
can
be
only
one
way
of
terminating
them
he
said
and
that
is
by
paying
the
money
into
court
he
said
the
thing
has
gone
too
far
i
see
she
said
then
she
held
out
her
hand
i
will
send
or
come
to
you
in
the
morning
i
am
too
confused
and
and
upset
even
to
think
at
this
moment
fleming
hastened
back
to
bury
street
and
found
yorke
sitting
as
he
had
left
him
with
the
letters
and
papers
littered
around
him
fleming
picked
them
up
and
put
them
away
and
got
out
yorke
dress
clothes
do
trouble
fleming
i
shall
dine
at
home
said
yorke
but
fleming
went
on
with
his
preparations
very
sorry
my
lord
but
the
kitchen
grate
is
not
in
order
he
intend
that
his
master
should
eat
his
dinner
in
company
with
a
man
in
possession
better
go
and
dine
at
the
club
my
lord
if
i
may
make
so
bold
yorke
got
up
with
a
grim
smile
perhaps
you
right
fleming
he
said
listlessly
i
suppose
they
never
have
anything
the
matter
with
the
kitchen
grate
at
holloway
or
whatever
other
quod
it
is
they
send
people
who
ca
pay
their
debts
and
what
about
these
clothes
fleming
perhaps
our
friend
in
the
next
room
will
object
to
my
walking
out
in
them
i
punch
his
head
if
he
was
to
offer
a
remark
on
the
subject
said
fleming
fiercely
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
if
i
might
say
a
word
my
lord
i
implore
your
lordship
not
to
take
this
business
too
much
to
heart
i
mean
not
to
worry
too
much
over
it
you
never
can
tell
what
may
turn
up
yorke
laughed
drearily
as
he
allowed
fleming
to
dress
him
i
wo
he
said
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
feel
so
cut
up
as
you
imagine
or
as
i
ought
fleming
i
feel
he
stopped
and
looked
round
absently
well
as
if
i
were
another
fellow
altogether
and
i
was
just
looking
on
half
sorry
and
half
amused
yes
that
right
keep
feeling
like
that
my
lord
said
fleming
cheeringly
depend
upon
it
it
will
come
out
right
yorke
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
dare
say
he
said
indifferently
do
sit
up
for
me
i
may
be
late
he
came
in
a
little
after
two
in
the
morning
and
fleming
could
have
been
almost
glad
if
his
beloved
master
had
showed
signs
of
having
spent
a
night
but
yorke
was
than
sober
and
looked
only
weary
and
sick
at
heart
as
he
had
done
for
weeks
past
oh
by
the
way
fleming
he
said
as
he
took
off
his
coat
and
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
it
you
must
call
me
pretty
early
i
have
to
be
down
in
the
city
you
know
that
was
all
chapter
xxxii
bought
and
paid
for
a
city
law
court
is
not
exactly
the
place
in
which
to
spend
a
happy
day
unless
you
happen
to
be
a
lawyer
engaged
in
a
profitable
case
there
and
yorke
as
he
entered
the
stuffy
grimy
murky
chamber
looked
round
with
a
feeling
of
surprise
and
grim
interest
upon
the
bench
sat
the
judge
in
a
gown
and
a
grubby
wig
a
barrister
was
drowsing
away
in
the
of
the
court
and
his
fellows
were
sleeping
or
stretching
and
yawning
round
him
the
public
was
represented
by
half
a
dozen
individuals
who
all
looked
as
if
they
had
not
been
to
bed
for
a
month
and
had
forgotten
to
wash
themselves
for
a
like
period
there
was
an
usher
who
yawned
behind
his
wand
one
or
two
policemen
with
wooden
countenances
and
two
or
three
individuals
who
were
like
yorke
defendants
in
various
suits
the
entrance
of
this
stalwart
and
decidedly
distinguished
and
aristocratic
personage
created
a
slight
sensation
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
seemed
to
be
forgotten
and
he
stood
and
looked
on
and
wondered
how
soon
his
case
would
be
heard
and
whether
he
would
be
carried
away
to
jail
forthwith
he
waited
for
a
half
hour
or
so
feeling
that
he
was
growing
dirty
and
grimy
like
the
rest
of
the
people
round
him
and
gradually
the
sense
of
the
disgrace
and
humiliation
of
his
position
stole
over
him
great
heavens
to
what
a
pass
he
had
come
he
had
lost
leslie
he
was
now
to
lose
good
name
and
honor
everything
would
it
not
be
better
for
himself
and
everybody
connected
with
him
if
he
went
outside
and
purchased
a
dose
of
prussic
acid
the
suspense
the
stuffy
court
the
droning
voice
of
the
counsel
began
to
drive
him
mad
he
went
up
to
the
usher
can
you
tell
me
when
my
case
comes
on
he
said
the
man
looked
at
him
sleepily
your
case
what
name
he
asked
without
any
and
with
a
kind
of
drowsy
impertinence
which
seemed
to
be
in
strict
harmony
with
the
air
of
the
place
auchester
said
yorke
i
am
the
the
defendant
horchester
do
know
ask
the
clerk
said
the
man
with
a
sick
feeling
of
shame
yorke
went
up
to
the
man
pointed
out
by
the
usher
and
put
the
same
question
to
him
auchester
duncombe
versus
auchester
levison
versus
auchester
arack
versus
auchester
said
the
clerk
in
a
dry
way
yes
i
dare
say
that
it
said
yorke
hating
the
sound
of
his
own
name
the
clerk
looked
down
a
list
then
raised
his
eyes
with
the
faintest
of
smiles
scratched
out
he
said
curtly
scratched
out
echoed
yorke
blankly
yes
sir
my
lord
said
the
clerk
who
while
looking
at
the
list
had
come
upon
yorke
title
the
cases
have
been
removed
from
the
list
settled
settled
i
do
understand
said
yorke
staring
at
him
i
only
just
come
down
i
paid
nothing
some
one
else
has
then
my
lord
said
the
clerk
wait
a
moment
till
this
case
is
heard
it
will
be
over
directly
and
i
explain
yorke
feeling
like
a
man
in
a
dream
stepped
into
a
corner
and
waited
presently
the
court
adjourned
for
luncheon
and
the
clerk
came
toward
him
this
way
my
lord
he
led
yorke
into
an
office
now
my
lord
yes
all
the
cases
have
been
discharged
from
the
list
been
settled
this
morning
this
morning
echoed
yorke
mechanically
still
with
a
vast
amazement
but
but
who
i
do
know
who
could
have
done
this
i
have
not
for
the
best
of
all
reasons
i
came
down
here
prepared
to
go
to
prison
or
wherever
else
you
sent
me
the
clerk
raised
his
brows
and
shook
his
head
gravely
yes
you
would
have
been
committed
my
lord
for
a
certainty
he
said
you
see
you
let
things
slide
too
long
but
there
is
no
fear
now
the
money
all
of
it
has
been
paid
you
are
quite
free
quite
i
congratulate
your
lordship
but
but
stammered
yorke
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
who
can
have
done
it
paid
it
is
it
the
duke
of
rothbury
could
dolph
have
heard
of
it
in
some
extraordinary
way
and
sent
the
money
the
clerk
went
into
the
inner
office
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
came
back
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
do
know
whether
i
am
doing
right
my
lord
he
said
gravely
and
even
cautiously
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
give
you
this
information
but
i
trust
to
your
lordship
discretion
you
wo
get
me
into
a
scrape
my
lord
no
no
said
yorke
who
is
it
the
clerk
handed
him
the
slip
of
paper
it
was
a
check
on
coutts
for
a
large
a
very
large
sum
and
it
was
signed
eleanor
dallas
eleanor
the
name
broke
in
a
kind
of
sigh
from
yorke
lips
and
his
face
reddened
but
it
was
pale
again
as
he
handed
the
check
back
to
the
clerk
thank
you
he
said
he
stood
and
looked
vacantly
before
him
as
if
he
had
forgotten
where
he
was
then
he
woke
with
a
start
then
i
can
go
he
said
certainly
my
lord
said
the
clerk
as
i
said
you
are
quite
free
there
are
no
actions
against
you
now
everything
is
squared
paid
yorke
thanked
him
again
wished
him
and
got
outside
everything
paid
and
by
eleanor
he
repeated
this
as
he
walked
from
the
city
to
the
west
as
he
tramped
slowly
with
downcast
head
across
hyde
park
he
told
himself
that
he
ought
to
be
grateful
that
he
could
not
feel
too
grateful
to
the
woman
who
had
come
to
his
aid
and
saved
him
from
ruin
and
disgrace
but
he
knew
why
she
had
done
it
and
he
knew
what
he
ought
to
do
in
return
the
least
he
could
do
would
be
to
go
and
kneel
at
her
feet
and
ask
her
to
accept
the
life
which
she
had
snatched
from
disgrace
and
why
should
he
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
had
proved
false
and
mercenary
and
base
and
there
was
nothing
now
to
prevent
him
asking
lady
eleanor
to
be
his
wife
and
yet
alas
he
could
not
get
that
other
face
out
of
his
mind
or
heart
he
thought
of
her
she
haunted
him
as
he
walked
along
the
clear
gray
eyes
so
tender
one
moment
so
full
of
fire
and
humor
the
next
the
dark
hair
the
graceful
figure
the
sweet
voice
oh
leslie
leslie
if
you
had
but
been
true
was
the
burden
of
his
heart
wail
he
looked
up
and
found
himself
close
upon
palace
gardens
unconsciously
his
feet
had
moved
in
that
direction
he
rang
the
bell
of
lady
eleanor
door
yes
her
ladyship
was
at
home
the
footman
said
and
said
it
in
that
serene
confident
tone
which
a
servant
uses
when
he
knows
that
his
mistress
will
be
glad
to
see
the
visitor
yorke
followed
the
man
to
the
small
lady
denby
was
there
tying
up
some
library
books
she
started
slightly
as
she
saw
his
altered
appearance
but
she
was
too
completely
a
woman
of
the
world
to
let
him
see
the
start
why
yorke
she
said
what
a
stranger
you
are
we
were
only
speaking
of
you
this
morning
at
breakfast
and
wondering
where
you
were
have
you
been
away
sit
down
or
tie
up
those
tiresome
books
for
me
will
you
they
slip
and
slide
about
in
the
most
aggravating
way
i
go
and
tell
eleanor
i
fancy
she
was
going
out
she
met
lady
eleanor
in
the
hall
and
drew
her
aside
yorke
is
in
there
eleanor
she
said
yorke
lady
eleanor
repeated
the
name
and
started
almost
guiltily
almost
fearfully
yes
i
came
to
tell
you
and
well
yes
prepare
you
i
do
want
you
to
do
as
i
did
jump
as
if
i
seen
a
bogey
man
he
has
been
ill
or
up
to
some
deviltry
or
other
and
he
looks
well
i
ca
tell
you
how
he
looks
it
gave
me
a
shock
i
thought
i
prepare
you
lady
eleanor
touched
her
hand
thank
you
dear
no
i
wo
look
shocked
he
looks
very
ill
very
ill
oh
worse
than
like
a
man
who
has
robbed
a
church
and
been
found
out
or
lost
everything
he
held
dear
lady
eleanor
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
they
were
trembling
i
do
mind
what
he
has
been
doing
she
said
oh
my
dear
eleanor
no
i
do
i
go
in
now
do
let
any
one
disturb
us
he
he
may
have
come
to
see
me
to
talk
about
something
she
went
into
the
room
and
yorke
turned
to
meet
her
it
was
well
that
she
had
been
forewarned
of
the
change
in
his
appearance
as
it
was
she
could
scarcely
suppress
the
cry
that
rose
to
her
lips
well
yorke
she
said
with
affected
lightness
tying
up
books
that
is
so
like
her
no
one
can
come
near
her
without
getting
employed
what
a
shame
to
worry
you
it
does
worry
me
he
said
he
leaned
against
the
table
and
looked
down
at
her
there
is
a
picture
of
millais
it
is
called
i
think
flower
which
lady
eleanor
might
have
sat
for
that
morning
so
delicate
so
graceful
so
refined
and
blanche
was
her
beauty
she
wore
a
loose
dress
of
soft
cashmere
cream
in
color
almost
greek
in
fashion
her
hair
was
like
gold
her
eyes
placid
yet
tender
with
a
touch
of
subdued
sadness
and
anxiety
in
them
a
charming
an
irresistible
picture
and
one
that
appealed
to
this
man
with
the
heart
aching
in
his
bosom
she
glanced
up
at
him
saw
the
haggard
face
the
dark
rings
round
the
eyes
that
indescribable
look
which
pain
and
despair
and
utter
abandonment
produce
as
plainly
as
the
die
stamps
the
on
the
piece
of
silver
and
her
heart
yearned
for
him
for
his
love
yearned
for
the
right
to
comfort
and
soothe
him
ah
if
he
would
only
have
it
so
if
he
would
only
let
her
how
happy
she
would
make
him
all
this
and
much
more
she
felt
but
she
looked
quite
placid
and
serene
like
a
dainty
lily
unstirred
by
the
wind
and
said
in
her
soft
voice
we
were
thinking
of
advertising
for
you
yorke
have
you
been
away
he
might
have
answered
yes
i
have
been
in
the
valley
of
sorrow
and
tribulation
on
the
desert
of
dead
love
and
vain
hope
but
instead
he
replied
no
just
here
in
london
but
i
have
been
busy
she
looked
up
and
smiled
busy
that
sounds
so
strange
and
so
comic
coming
from
you
and
yet
it
is
true
he
said
i
have
been
busy
thinking
if
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
she
did
not
notice
it
and
that
hard
work
for
me
it
so
new
you
see
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
he
held
the
string
with
which
he
had
been
tying
up
the
books
in
his
hands
and
fidgeted
with
it
restlessly
lady
eleanor
dropped
into
had
he
been
to
the
chrysanthemum
show
at
the
temple
had
he
noticed
that
the
duchess
of
orloffe
was
not
going
to
give
her
autumn
ball
did
he
he
broke
in
suddenly
as
if
he
had
not
been
listening
his
voice
hoarse
and
thick
eleanor
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
i
do
what
yorke
she
said
why
did
you
fling
so
much
money
away
upon
a
worthless
scamp
his
face
went
white
then
red
who
told
you
she
breathed
they
told
me
down
at
the
court
where
i
had
gone
to
be
disgraced
he
said
and
you
saved
me
how
can
i
thank
you
eleanor
how
can
i
and
you
would
have
done
it
in
secret
would
have
kept
it
from
me
yes
oh
yes
she
murmured
her
head
drooping
do
do
say
anything
about
it
it
was
nothing
nothing
she
looked
up
at
him
eagerly
pleadingly
yorke
you
will
not
think
badly
of
me
because
i
did
it
why
should
i
i
am
rich
you
do
know
how
rich
and
what
better
could
i
do
with
the
stupid
money
than
give
it
to
a
a
friend
who
needed
it
more
ten
thousand
times
more
than
i
do
or
ever
shall
be
angry
with
me
yorke
angry
the
blood
flew
to
his
face
and
his
eyes
flashed
he
drew
nearer
to
the
chair
in
which
she
sat
he
knelt
on
one
knee
beside
her
eleanor
i
am
utterly
worthless
you
know
that
quite
well
i
was
not
worth
the
saving
but
as
you
have
saved
me
will
you
accept
me
eleanor
will
you
be
my
wife
her
face
went
white
with
the
ecstasy
which
shot
through
her
heart
ah
for
how
long
had
she
thirsted
hungered
for
these
words
from
his
lips
and
they
had
come
at
last
will
you
be
my
wife
eleanor
i
will
try
to
make
you
happy
i
will
do
my
best
heaven
helping
to
be
a
good
husband
to
you
stop
dear
if
you
act
wisely
you
will
send
me
about
my
business
there
are
fifty
a
hundred
better
men
who
love
you
you
could
scarcely
have
a
worse
than
i
but
if
you
will
say
i
will
try
and
be
less
unworthy
of
you
all
my
life
i
will
never
forget
all
that
i
owe
you
never
forget
that
you
saved
me
from
ruin
and
disgrace
now
dear
i
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
without
a
word
then
as
he
took
it
her
passion
burst
through
the
bonds
in
which
she
thought
to
bind
it
and
she
swayed
forward
and
dropped
upon
his
breast
yorke
yorke
you
know
came
through
her
parted
lips
you
know
i
love
you
have
always
loved
you
my
poor
eleanor
he
said
almost
indeed
quite
pityingly
such
a
bad
worthless
lot
as
i
am
no
no
she
panted
no
no
the
best
the
highest
to
me
and
and
if
you
were
not
it
it
would
be
all
the
same
oh
yorke
be
good
be
kind
to
me
for
you
are
all
the
world
to
me
they
sat
and
talked
hand
in
hand
for
some
time
and
once
during
that
talk
he
said
by
the
way
eleanor
how
did
you
hear
i
was
in
such
a
mess
how
did
you
come
to
know
it
was
a
very
natural
question
under
the
circumstances
but
lady
eleanor
started
and
turned
white
absolutely
white
with
fear
no
no
not
one
word
will
i
ever
say
or
let
you
say
about
this
stupid
money
business
she
exclaimed
then
she
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
against
her
cheek
why
sir
what
does
it
matter
it
was
only
only
lending
it
to
you
for
a
little
time
you
see
it
will
all
be
yours
soon
lady
denby
came
in
after
a
discreet
cough
outside
but
lady
eleanor
did
not
move
or
take
her
hand
from
yorke
oh
said
lady
denby
eleanor
has
made
me
very
happy
lady
denby
he
said
rising
but
still
holding
lady
eleanor
hand
oh
said
lady
denby
again
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
that
you
deserve
her
no
thank
you
i
could
tell
such
an
obvious
fib
what
i
going
to
say
in
the
shape
of
congratulation
is
that
she
is
much
too
good
for
you
that
is
so
he
said
with
a
grim
smile
you
stay
to
dinner
murmured
lady
eleanor
you
will
stay
yorke
yes
he
said
bending
down
and
kissing
her
yes
thanks
but
i
must
go
and
change
my
things
i
awfully
dirty
and
seedy
she
went
with
him
to
the
door
as
if
she
begrudged
every
moment
that
he
should
be
out
of
her
sight
and
still
smiled
after
he
had
left
her
and
had
got
down
the
gardens
then
suddenly
he
stopped
and
looked
round
him
with
a
ghostly
look
and
yet
it
was
only
the
face
of
leslie
that
had
flashed
across
his
mental
vision
only
the
face
of
the
girl
who
had
jilted
him
my
god
shall
i
never
forget
her
he
muttered
hoarsely
not
even
now
chapter
xxxiii
a
little
sunshine
the
announcement
of
the
engagement
between
lord
auchester
and
lady
eleanor
dallas
had
appeared
in
the
society
papers
a
month
ago
and
the
world
of
upper
ten
had
expended
its
congratulations
and
began
asking
itself
when
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
for
it
was
agreed
on
all
hands
that
so
excellent
and
altogether
desirable
a
match
could
not
take
place
too
soon
he
has
been
dreadfully
wild
i
told
my
dear
said
one
gossip
to
another
and
is
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
but
there
is
plenty
of
money
on
her
side
indeed
they
say
that
lately
she
has
become
fabulously
rich
so
that
will
be
all
right
of
course
she
might
have
done
better
but
everybody
knows
she
was
ridiculously
fond
of
him
oh
quite
too
ridiculously
gave
herself
away
in
fact
and
she
goes
about
looking
so
happy
and
victorious
that
it
is
really
quite
indecent
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
the
remarked
gossip
number
two
for
he
looks
as
grave
as
a
judge
and
as
glum
as
an
undertaker
the
mere
prospect
of
matrimony
seems
to
have
taken
all
the
spirits
out
of
him
not
like
the
same
man
i
assure
you
my
dear
it
was
autumn
now
the
greenery
of
the
trees
had
turned
to
russet
and
gold
a
mystic
stillness
brooded
softly
over
the
country
lanes
the
yellow
corn
waved
sleepily
to
the
soft
breeze
the
blackberries
darkened
the
and
on
the
roads
lay
not
thickly
as
yet
but
in
twos
and
threes
the
leaves
of
the
oak
and
the
chestnut
an
air
of
repose
and
quietude
reigned
over
the
land
as
if
nature
almost
tired
of
the
sun
and
heat
and
the
multitudinous
noises
of
summer
were
taking
a
short
nap
to
prepare
itself
for
the
rigor
and
robust
energy
of
winter
in
one
of
the
loveliest
of
our
country
lanes
stood
a
village
school
it
was
a
picturesque
little
building
of
white
stone
and
red
tiles
the
tiny
adjoining
it
was
so
overgrown
by
ivy
as
to
resemble
a
green
bower
there
was
a
window
at
the
back
and
an
orchard
in
which
the
golden
and
ruddy
apples
were
almost
as
thick
as
the
blackberries
in
the
lanes
everything
in
and
about
this
school
was
the
picture
of
neatness
the
curtains
of
white
and
pink
muslin
were
exquisitely
clean
and
artistically
draped
behind
the
windows
the
were
as
white
as
marble
the
diminutive
knocker
on
the
door
shone
like
a
newly
minted
sovereign
not
a
weed
showed
its
head
in
the
small
garden
which
literally
glowed
with
single
and
double
dahlias
stocks
and
chrysanthemums
there
was
a
little
gate
in
the
closely
cut
hedge
which
was
painted
a
snowy
white
in
short
the
tiny
domain
made
a
picture
which
millais
or
marcus
stone
or
leslie
would
have
delighted
to
transfer
to
canvas
from
the
open
door
of
the
school
there
issued
a
hum
and
buzz
which
resembled
that
which
proceeds
from
the
door
of
a
for
afternoon
school
was
still
on
and
the
pupils
were
still
at
their
lessons
the
village
it
was
rather
more
than
half
a
mile
from
the
school
was
that
of
newfold
a
quiet
sleepy
little
place
which
not
even
the
restless
tourist
seems
to
have
discovered
a
small
cluster
of
houses
with
an
inn
a
church
and
a
couple
of
shops
lying
in
the
hollow
between
the
two
ranges
of
loamshire
hills
a
londoner
would
tell
you
that
newfold
was
at
least
five
hundred
years
behind
the
times
but
if
it
be
so
newfold
does
not
care
there
is
enough
plowing
and
in
winter
enough
sowing
and
tilling
in
spring
enough
harvesting
in
autumn
to
keep
the
kettle
boiling
and
newfold
is
quite
content
some
day
one
of
those
individuals
who
discover
such
places
will
happen
on
it
write
an
article
about
it
attract
attention
to
it
and
so
ruin
it
but
he
has
chanced
to
come
upon
it
yet
and
oh
let
us
pray
that
he
may
keep
off
it
for
a
long
while
for
newfolds
are
getting
scarcer
every
year
and
soon
if
we
do
not
take
care
england
will
become
one
vast
hideous
plain
of
bricks
and
mortar
and
there
will
be
no
place
in
which
we
can
take
refuge
from
the
fogs
and
smoke
of
the
great
towns
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
school
would
up
and
the
girls
were
standing
up
singing
the
evening
hymn
which
brought
the
day
work
to
a
close
in
the
center
of
the
room
stood
a
pleasant
young
lady
whose
eyes
mild
and
gentle
as
they
were
seemed
to
be
looking
everywhere
on
a
small
platform
stood
another
young
lady
with
dark
hair
and
gray
eyes
these
were
the
two
mistresses
of
the
newfold
village
school
and
their
names
were
leslie
lisle
and
lucy
somes
life
is
not
all
clouds
and
rain
thank
god
the
sun
shines
sometimes
and
the
sun
of
good
luck
had
shone
upon
leslie
and
lucy
it
was
good
luck
that
they
should
pass
the
examination
that
ordeal
to
which
they
had
looked
forward
with
such
fear
and
trembling
it
was
good
luck
that
there
should
be
two
appointments
vacant
but
oh
it
was
the
superlative
of
luck
that
these
appointments
should
be
to
the
same
school
and
that
the
school
should
be
here
in
peaceful
newfold
it
seemed
to
leslie
as
if
misfortune
had
grown
tired
of
buffeting
her
and
had
decided
to
leave
her
alone
for
a
time
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
when
lucy
somes
ran
into
her
room
at
torrington
square
with
the
news
that
they
were
to
be
sent
to
the
same
school
and
in
her
beloved
county
of
course
influence
had
been
used
at
headquarters
by
lucy
people
but
lucy
persisted
that
luck
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
anything
else
and
that
leslie
had
brought
the
good
fortune
and
it
did
not
lessen
lucy
happiness
that
leslie
having
obtained
the
most
marks
at
the
was
given
the
post
of
and
that
she
lucy
was
to
be
her
subordinate
it
is
quite
right
dear
she
said
brightly
and
cheerfully
of
course
you
ought
to
be
the
first
any
one
could
see
that
at
half
a
glance
you
are
ten
times
quicker
and
cleverer
than
i
and
besides
if
we
are
to
be
together
and
oh
how
delightful
it
is
to
think
that
we
are
i
would
a
thousand
times
rather
you
were
the
principal
we
will
both
be
lucy
leslie
had
said
as
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
had
put
her
arms
round
the
girl
and
kissed
her
they
had
only
been
four
days
at
the
school
but
short
as
the
time
had
been
they
had
grown
fond
of
it
fond
of
the
work
and
the
children
and
who
can
tell
how
fond
and
proud
of
the
little
house
that
nestled
against
the
school
building
lucy
was
like
a
child
in
her
unrestrained
joy
and
delight
and
if
leslie
took
their
good
fortune
more
quietly
she
was
not
lacking
in
gratitude
in
this
new
life
she
would
not
only
find
peace
please
god
but
work
work
that
in
time
might
bring
her
forgetfulness
of
the
past
and
the
forgetfulness
for
which
she
prayed
nightly
was
as
much
of
happiness
as
she
dared
hope
for
the
lily
that
has
been
beaten
down
by
the
storm
may
live
and
bloom
still
but
the
chances
are
that
it
will
never
again
rear
its
stately
head
as
of
old
the
evening
hymn
was
finished
leslie
struck
the
bell
on
the
desk
before
her
and
in
her
sweet
voice
said
children
and
with
an
answering
teachers
the
children
trooped
out
lucy
went
and
stood
beside
leslie
and
watched
the
happy
throng
as
it
ran
laughing
and
shouting
to
the
meadow
how
happy
they
are
leslie
and
how
good
too
i
am
sure
they
are
the
best
children
in
the
world
and
many
of
them
are
so
pretty
and
rosy
and
they
are
all
healthy
all
except
two
or
three
i
should
hate
to
have
a
school
full
of
sickly
undergrown
children
all
peevish
and
weary
and
discontented
but
all
ours
are
cheerful
and
willing
they
would
find
it
hard
to
be
otherwise
where
you
are
lucy
said
leslie
looking
at
the
happy
face
with
a
loving
smile
oh
i
oh
yes
i
cheerful
enough
said
lucy
laughing
and
blushing
i
just
running
over
with
happiness
and
contentment
but
i
afraid
that
they
could
get
on
very
fast
if
i
were
quite
alone
with
them
they
would
mind
me
enough
now
you
are
they
afraid
of
me
said
leslie
smiling
no
no
lucy
hastened
to
respond
afraid
no
no
but
they
look
up
to
you
and
think
more
of
your
good
opinion
already
oh
i
can
see
that
short
as
the
time
has
been
they
were
quite
right
up
in
london
in
making
you
the
dear
are
you
tired
leslie
it
has
been
rather
hot
for
the
time
of
year
and
the
children
good
as
they
are
make
a
noise
does
your
head
ache
i
afraid
you
will
find
it
rather
trying
at
first
i
am
not
tired
and
my
head
does
ache
in
the
least
said
leslie
and
why
should
i
more
than
you
find
it
trying
lucy
and
dear
i
want
you
to
let
me
have
the
english
history
class
you
have
got
more
than
your
fair
share
did
you
think
that
i
should
not
notice
it
i
believe
you
would
take
all
the
work
if
i
would
let
you
you
greedy
girl
lucy
blushed
she
blushed
on
the
slightest
provocation
i
do
want
you
to
work
too
hard
leslie
she
said
you
are
not
strong
yet
not
nearly
so
strong
as
i
am
and
you
felt
the
awful
grinding
for
that
exam
more
than
i
did
because
you
were
not
used
to
it
and
had
to
do
it
in
a
shorter
time
and
so
i
am
going
to
take
care
of
you
leslie
laughed
why
i
could
lift
you
up
and
carry
you
round
the
room
little
girl
she
said
in
loving
banter
and
it
is
i
who
have
to
take
care
of
you
but
we
take
care
of
each
other
lucy
and
now
let
us
go
in
to
tea
they
went
into
the
little
house
and
the
small
maid
who
was
and
cook
rolled
into
one
had
set
out
the
tea
in
the
cosy
parlor
fragrant
with
the
musk
and
mignonette
which
bloomed
in
the
lucy
looked
round
with
a
sigh
of
ineffable
content
is
it
delicious
leslie
she
exclaimed
with
bated
breath
i
feel
like
robinson
crusoe
robinson
crusoe
with
everything
ready
made
for
him
and
all
the
luxuries
said
leslie
laughingly
yes
that
what
i
mean
assented
lucy
naively
all
through
i
looked
forward
to
something
like
this
but
my
dreams
never
reached
anything
half
so
delightful
for
one
thing
i
never
dreamed
that
i
should
have
you
for
a
companion
and
friend
i
thought
that
there
would
be
sure
to
be
a
thorn
in
my
bed
of
roses
and
that
that
thorn
would
probably
take
the
shape
of
a
disagreeable
some
horrid
disagreeable
person
who
would
be
always
complaining
and
scolding
but
you
mother
writes
that
i
must
have
exaggerated
just
to
please
her
when
i
described
the
school
and
told
her
what
you
were
like
but
i
exaggerate
a
bit
oh
leslie
she
stopped
with
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
to
her
mouth
do
you
think
we
are
too
happy
that
something
will
happen
to
spoil
it
all
leslie
smiled
i
think
not
she
said
it
is
only
those
who
do
deserve
to
be
happy
whose
happiness
does
last
now
you
lucy
but
give
me
some
more
tea
and
do
try
and
croak
because
you
make
the
most
awful
failure
of
it
lucy
face
wreathed
itself
in
its
wonted
smile
again
i
wonder
whether
there
are
two
happier
girls
in
all
the
world
than
you
and
i
leslie
she
said
what
shall
we
do
this
evening
go
for
a
walk
you
have
been
into
the
village
yet
will
you
come
it
is
such
a
pretty
quaint
little
place
with
the
tiniest
and
most
delightful
church
you
ever
saw
is
it
strange
that
we
should
be
pitchforked
down
here
into
a
place
we
know
nothing
about
and
never
heard
of
it
is
like
robinson
crusoe
again
i
hope
the
natives
will
not
be
savage
leslie
looked
up
from
the
she
was
examining
we
shall
have
very
little
to
do
with
the
natives
savage
or
friendly
lucy
she
said
of
course
not
assented
lucy
cheerfully
i
suppose
the
wife
will
call
oh
i
forgot
he
said
the
first
morning
he
came
to
read
prayers
that
he
was
married
but
the
squire
lady
will
drive
up
in
a
carriage
and
pair
and
walk
through
the
school
with
her
eyeglass
up
but
no
one
else
will
come
to
bother
us
you
see
she
ran
on
jumping
up
to
water
the
flowers
in
the
window
are
supposed
to
be
neither
fish
flesh
nor
fowl
and
not
very
good
red
herring
people
do
visit
them
that
is
good
news
for
at
any
rate
said
leslie
smiling
yes
we
do
want
anybody
do
we
dear
you
and
i
together
can
be
quite
happy
without
the
rest
of
the
world
and
now
about
our
walk
shall
we
go
leslie
i
do
think
i
will
this
evening
lucy
i
will
stay
and
go
over
these
books
but
you
shall
go
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
bring
back
a
full
and
particular
account
of
your
adventures
no
no
i
stay
began
lucy
but
leslie
looked
up
at
her
with
the
expression
lucy
had
learned
to
know
so
well
very
well
dear
she
said
gently
i
will
just
run
into
the
village
and
order
some
things
we
want
and
come
straight
back
and
mind
you
are
not
to
do
all
those
or
i
shall
feel
hurt
and
injured
leslie
worked
away
at
her
exercise
books
for
some
little
time
then
she
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
window
and
letting
her
hands
lie
in
her
lap
enjoyed
the
rest
which
she
had
earned
by
a
day
toil
but
not
unexpected
toil
as
she
sat
there
looking
out
dreamily
at
the
lane
which
the
setting
sun
was
filling
with
a
golden
haze
she
felt
very
much
like
the
hermit
of
martin
she
had
refused
to
go
down
to
the
village
with
lucy
from
choice
and
not
from
any
sense
of
duty
toward
the
exercise
books
she
felt
that
she
and
the
world
had
so
to
speak
done
with
each
other
and
she
shrunk
from
encountering
new
faces
and
the
necessity
of
talking
to
strangers
if
fate
would
let
her
live
out
her
life
in
this
modest
cottage
she
would
be
contented
to
confine
herself
to
the
little
garden
surrounding
it
and
perhaps
the
meadows
beyond
with
her
children
and
her
flowers
she
was
convinced
that
she
could
be
if
not
happy
at
any
rate
not
discontented
she
had
lived
her
life
young
as
she
was
fate
could
give
her
no
joy
to
equal
that
which
yorke
love
or
fancied
love
had
given
nor
could
it
deal
out
to
her
a
more
bitter
sorrow
than
the
loss
of
yorke
and
her
father
so
let
lucy
act
as
a
between
her
and
the
outer
world
and
she
leslie
would
work
when
she
could
and
when
she
could
not
would
live
over
again
in
her
mind
and
memory
that
happy
past
which
had
been
summed
up
in
a
few
all
too
brief
days
of
yorke
she
had
heard
nothing
she
had
never
read
a
society
paper
in
her
life
and
was
not
likely
to
have
seen
one
during
the
last
busy
month
so
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
engagement
between
him
and
lady
eleanor
dallas
and
if
she
had
known
if
she
had
chanced
to
have
read
the
paragraphs
in
which
the
betrothal
was
announced
and
commented
on
she
would
not
have
identified
lord
auchester
with
yorke
the
duke
of
rothbury
as
she
thought
him
sometimes
this
evening
for
instance
she
wondered
with
a
dull
aching
pain
which
always
oppressed
her
whenever
she
thought
of
him
where
he
had
gone
and
whether
he
still
remembered
whether
he
regretted
the
flirtation
he
had
carried
on
with
the
girl
at
portmaris
or
whether
he
only
laughed
over
it
perhaps
with
the
dark
handsome
woman
the
finetta
to
whom
he
had
gone
back
the
sun
had
set
behind
the
hills
and
the
twilight
had
crept
over
the
scene
before
lucy
came
hurrying
up
the
path
did
you
think
i
was
lost
leslie
she
said
with
a
laugh
leslie
looked
round
and
though
it
was
nearly
dark
in
the
room
she
saw
that
lucy
eyes
were
particularly
bright
and
that
there
was
a
flush
on
her
cheeks
which
did
not
appear
to
have
been
caused
by
her
haste
it
sounds
very
unkind
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
you
dear
she
said
it
is
late
i
suppose
where
have
you
been
lucy
came
up
to
the
window
tossing
her
straw
hat
and
light
jacket
on
the
sofa
as
she
passed
leslie
you
said
something
about
adventures
when
i
was
starting
did
i
said
leslie
and
have
you
had
any
let
me
look
at
you
you
look
flushed
and
excited
what
is
it
lucy
yes
i
have
had
an
adventure
she
said
her
soft
guileless
eyes
drooping
for
a
moment
then
lifting
themselves
candidly
to
again
but
let
me
begin
at
the
beginning
as
children
say
leslie
you
must
go
and
see
the
village
it
is
the
dearest
little
place
in
all
the
world
and
just
like
one
of
the
pictures
one
sees
at
the
academy
you
will
want
to
sketch
it
the
moment
you
see
it
i
know
well
i
went
to
the
shop
oh
the
funniest
shop
you
ever
saw
you
go
down
two
steps
into
it
and
even
then
it
is
only
just
high
enough
for
you
to
stand
up
in
and
they
sell
everything
tapes
treacle
soap
snuff
laces
biscuits
everything
and
the
woman
that
keeps
it
is
the
mother
of
one
of
our
girls
and
she
made
ever
so
much
of
me
and
sent
her
best
respects
to
you
beautiful
teacher
as
she
said
the
girls
all
called
you
is
it
all
fiction
or
only
the
last
sentence
lucy
said
leslie
my
dear
leslie
i
have
heard
them
call
you
so
myself
said
lucy
i
went
to
the
butcher
the
butcher
is
one
of
nature
noblemen
and
took
my
order
for
four
mutton
chops
as
if
i
were
a
princess
ordering
a
whole
sheep
and
then
i
went
out
into
the
country
beyond
and
if
i
were
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
it
you
would
say
i
was
exaggerating
which
you
never
do
of
course
put
in
leslie
gravely
it
is
simply
heavenly
continued
lucy
ignoring
the
insinuation
such
lovely
meadows
and
hills
and
there
is
a
delicious
river
full
of
trout
so
a
man
who
was
working
close
by
said
can
you
throw
a
fly
leslie
i
can
and
i
will
teach
you
it
is
the
jolliest
fun
in
the
world
fishing
and
when
i
got
to
the
opening
out
of
the
valley
i
saw
a
tremendous
house
a
great
white
place
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
it
took
me
quite
by
surprise
for
i
had
no
idea
that
there
were
any
great
people
living
near
us
well
not
exactly
near
for
this
must
be
four
or
five
miles
off
i
asked
a
man
who
lived
there
and
he
said
that
it
belonged
to
a
lady
lady
there
i
have
forgotten
the
name
after
all
and
i
wanted
to
remember
it
to
tell
you
never
mind
said
leslie
she
is
an
awfully
great
lady
and
tremendously
rich
my
informant
said
i
wish
i
could
remember
her
name
it
was
rather
a
pretty
one
well
then
she
paused
a
moment
and
her
color
came
and
went
i
thought
i
would
rest
for
a
little
while
and
i
sat
down
on
a
big
stone
up
a
little
grassy
lane
and
while
i
was
sitting
there
quiet
as
a
mouse
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
on
the
short
turf
and
so
suddenly
it
made
me
jump
a
huge
horse
came
galloping
up
he
saw
me
and
shied
goodness
how
he
shied
i
thought
the
man
on
his
back
must
be
thrown
but
he
sat
there
like
like
a
rock
but
he
swore
i
do
think
he
saw
me
at
first
leslie
in
fact
i
am
sure
he
did
for
when
he
did
he
raised
his
hat
as
if
to
apologize
for
the
bad
words
and
then
rode
on
is
that
all
said
leslie
with
a
smile
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
at
the
very
least
that
he
stooped
down
and
caught
you
up
and
you
would
have
been
carried
off
into
captivity
but
for
a
gallant
young
man
who
ran
up
and
seized
the
horse
etc
leslie
remonstrated
lucy
laughing
and
blushing
he
did
stop
a
moment
or
speak
of
course
but
rode
on
straight
away
but
leslie
you
never
saw
such
a
handsome
man
or
such
a
one
the
knight
of
the
woful
countenance
said
leslie
lucy
laughed
but
rather
gravely
well
if
you
had
seen
him
i
do
think
you
would
have
laughed
leslie
he
looked
so
wretched
and
weary
and
i
do
know
exactly
how
to
describe
it
so
reckless
he
seemed
as
if
he
did
care
where
he
was
riding
or
whether
the
horse
kept
straight
on
or
fell
so
that
he
kept
straight
on
and
did
fall
on
or
run
over
you
it
is
all
right
said
leslie
but
lucy
dear
i
do
think
you
must
be
out
so
late
and
alone
again
especially
if
there
are
reckless
young
men
riding
about
the
roads
and
lanes
yes
said
lucy
but
i
have
come
to
the
end
of
my
adventures
yet
leslie
not
yet
no
said
lucy
almost
shyly
of
course
i
was
rather
startled
by
that
horse
thundering
by
it
was
so
very
big
and
it
passed
so
near
almost
on
to
me
you
know
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
called
out
she
blushed
it
was
very
foolish
i
know
and
i
know
you
would
have
done
so
do
be
too
sure
did
the
knight
come
back
lucy
no
no
and
the
blush
grew
more
furious
of
course
he
did
not
i
do
suppose
he
heard
me
but
some
one
else
did
for
there
came
up
the
moment
afterward
a
gentleman
not
another
on
horseback
lucy
do
be
too
prodigal
of
your
mounted
heroes
lucy
laughed
no
this
one
was
not
on
horseback
he
was
walking
and
was
quite
a
man
to
the
other
though
he
was
nearly
yes
nearly
as
good
looking
two
handsome
young
men
in
one
evening
is
that
rather
an
unfair
allowance
said
leslie
lucy
smiled
i
knew
you
would
make
fun
of
it
all
leslie
she
said
and
i
mind
in
the
least
i
like
to
hear
you
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
serious
in
it
i
should
hope
not
lucy
leslie
you
really
do
deserve
that
i
should
tell
you
any
more
you
do
indeed
pray
do
punish
me
so
severely
responded
leslie
my
levity
only
conceals
an
overpowering
curiosity
what
did
the
second
stranger
say
or
do
well
he
said
and
he
could
say
much
less
could
he
you
hurt
how
you
must
have
screamed
i
suppose
if
i
had
been
listening
i
should
have
heard
you
here
and
of
course
i
said
no
continued
lucy
severely
ignoring
this
remark
and
that
i
had
only
been
a
little
startled
by
the
horse
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
who
it
was
and
when
i
said
he
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
tell
me
but
instead
he
asked
if
i
knew
the
way
to
the
railway
station
now
do
say
that
you
told
him
and
that
he
raised
his
hat
and
went
off
said
leslie
with
mock
earnestness
lucy
laughed
but
said
shyly
well
i
told
him
but
he
go
just
at
once
he
asked
me
one
or
two
other
questions
which
was
the
nearest
village
and
so
on
and
of
course
i
had
to
answer
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
then
we
both
laughed
or
rather
he
smiled
for
he
seemed
very
grave
and
preoccupied
i
think
he
was
a
lawyer
or
something
of
that
sort
he
looked
like
a
business
man
and
presently
he
said
as
if
accounting
for
his
being
there
that
he
had
walked
from
white
place
that
was
the
house
on
the
and
that
he
was
going
back
to
london
and
and
well
that
all
are
you
quite
sure
that
was
all
asked
leslie
with
burlesque
severity
lucy
fair
face
flushed
oh
i
got
a
in
my
hand
i
meant
to
put
in
the
garden
below
the
window
and
he
noticed
it
and
said
that
he
wished
they
had
them
in
london
and
well
i
offered
it
to
him
lucy
lucy
jumped
up
really
really
and
honestly
leslie
i
did
it
without
thinking
and
he
took
it
at
once
without
any
fuss
or
nonsense
you
see
he
was
a
gentleman
she
added
with
delicious
simplicity
leslie
shook
her
head
with
a
smile
it
is
all
too
evident
that
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
out
alone
my
dear
she
said
why
lucy
for
something
like
tears
had
began
to
glitter
in
lucy
gentle
eyes
why
you
silly
girl
i
am
only
in
fun
why
should
you
not
direct
a
stranger
to
the
railway
station
and
why
should
you
give
him
the
fern
he
coveted
poor
londoner
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
it
you
are
quite
sure
leslie
afterward
afterward
as
i
was
walking
home
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
perhaps
been
unladylike
the
awful
word
left
her
lips
in
a
horrified
whisper
my
dear
you
could
be
if
you
tried
said
leslie
with
quiet
decision
now
run
and
put
your
things
away
and
we
will
talk
it
all
over
again
while
we
are
having
supper
she
took
the
gentle
face
in
her
hands
and
kissed
it
you
are
very
clever
lucy
but
that
is
the
one
thing
you
could
never
attain
to
they
sat
for
a
long
time
over
their
simple
meal
talking
of
their
school
discussing
the
various
capacities
of
the
pupils
arranging
classes
and
so
on
and
once
or
twice
leslie
referred
to
and
declared
that
she
did
not
believe
a
word
of
them
and
that
lucy
had
invented
the
whole
to
amuse
her
little
suspecting
that
the
big
house
lucy
had
seen
was
the
famous
white
place
belonging
to
lady
eleanor
dallas
that
the
horseman
was
lord
yorke
auchester
and
that
the
stranger
who
looked
like
a
lawyer
and
who
had
walked
off
with
lucy
fern
was
ralph
duncombe
chapter
xxxiv
was
yorke
happy
lady
eleanor
was
happy
and
unlike
a
great
many
persons
was
not
ashamed
to
admit
that
she
was
why
should
i
be
ashamed
or
try
to
hide
my
joy
she
said
to
lady
denby
who
remarked
her
niece
high
spirits
and
her
evident
satisfaction
with
her
own
condition
and
the
world
in
general
i
am
happy
happy
happy
and
every
one
may
know
it
they
do
know
it
my
dear
said
lady
denby
dryly
and
they
are
welcome
to
retorted
lady
eleanor
laughingly
i
count
myself
the
luckiest
girl
in
the
world
i
am
young
not
hideously
plain
rich
very
rich
duncombe
says
by
the
way
aunt
you
will
be
very
careful
not
to
mention
his
name
in
yorke
hearing
and
i
am
going
to
marry
the
man
i
have
been
in
love
with
ever
since
i
was
so
high
i
wake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
i
am
glad
to
wake
and
i
tell
myself
all
this
over
and
over
again
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
sometimes
but
i
know
it
is
all
true
when
the
morning
comes
oh
yes
i
am
happy
at
last
and
yorke
is
very
happy
too
said
lady
denby
and
the
moment
after
the
question
had
left
her
lips
she
was
sorry
she
had
asked
it
and
she
hastened
to
add
but
of
course
he
is
men
generally
look
poorly
when
they
are
particularly
happy
i
noticed
just
as
they
invariably
blow
their
noses
when
they
want
to
cry
why
should
he
be
happy
said
lady
eleanor
after
a
pause
but
her
face
had
grown
almost
grave
and
almost
troubled
as
you
say
men
do
go
about
as
if
they
were
dancing
to
music
as
we
women
do
and
they
do
sing
as
we
do
and
and
if
yorke
is
not
boisterous
why
did
you
say
that
she
demanded
suddenly
changing
her
tone
and
turning
upon
lady
denby
anxiously
and
nearly
angrily
do
you
think
he
looks
dissatisfied
as
if
as
if
he
were
sorry
my
dear
child
your
love
for
that
young
fellow
is
softening
your
brain
responded
lady
denby
quietly
of
course
i
have
noticed
nothing
he
is
quiet
but
i
suppose
most
men
who
are
on
the
brink
of
matrimony
are
quiet
they
hear
the
clanking
of
their
chains
as
they
are
being
forged
and
are
thinking
of
the
time
when
they
will
be
riveted
upon
them
no
man
really
likes
being
married
there
shall
be
no
chains
for
yorke
said
lady
eleanor
softly
or
if
there
must
be
then
i
will
cover
them
with
velvet
you
shall
see
you
shall
see
certainly
yorke
did
not
go
about
as
if
to
invisible
music
or
sing
as
he
went
and
he
was
as
lady
denby
put
it
quiet
very
quiet
but
if
he
was
not
boisterous
he
was
everything
else
that
a
woman
could
desire
in
a
betrothed
he
spent
a
portion
of
each
day
at
kensington
palace
gardens
he
was
always
ready
to
accompany
lady
eleanor
to
the
park
the
theater
concerts
balls
and
even
shopping
indeed
the
patience
with
which
he
would
stroll
up
and
down
bond
street
or
oxford
street
smoking
cigarette
after
cigarette
while
lady
eleanor
was
shopping
was
worthy
of
the
highest
commendation
and
immensely
calculated
to
astonish
his
wild
bachelor
friends
what
he
thought
about
as
he
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
hot
pavements
of
those
fashionable
thoroughfares
heaven
only
knows
at
any
rate
it
is
well
that
lady
eleanor
did
every
morning
he
rode
with
her
in
the
park
there
was
no
need
to
sell
his
horse
now
or
to
sack
fleming
and
the
loungers
on
the
rails
as
they
raised
their
hats
to
his
beautiful
companion
growled
enviously
lucky
beggar
going
to
marry
the
prettiest
and
richest
girl
of
the
season
some
men
get
all
the
plums
in
this
world
pudding
altogether
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
in
the
society
of
his
betrothed
but
there
were
still
some
hours
of
the
day
in
which
he
was
free
to
amuse
himself
after
his
own
devices
and
he
might
have
passed
a
very
pleasant
time
for
there
was
still
a
large
contingent
of
his
friends
in
town
and
there
were
outings
at
the
riverside
club
drives
to
richmond
and
so
on
but
yorke
was
seen
in
none
of
the
places
where
the
youth
of
his
sex
most
do
congregate
and
he
spent
the
hours
of
his
freedom
in
long
walks
into
the
country
around
london
or
in
the
of
the
quietest
of
the
clubs
and
he
was
always
alone
alone
with
that
strange
absent
look
in
his
eyes
that
look
which
lets
out
the
secret
and
tells
all
who
see
it
that
a
man
mind
is
wandering
either
backward
or
forward
generally
backward
all
the
world
knew
of
his
engagement
and
every
man
who
met
him
congratulated
him
all
the
world
except
the
duke
of
rothbury
from
whom
no
word
of
congratulation
had
come
have
you
written
to
godolphin
lady
eleanor
had
asked
shyly
and
yorke
with
a
little
start
had
said
no
that
there
was
no
occasion
he
would
see
it
in
the
papers
but
he
may
not
they
only
get
galignani
in
switzerland
at
least
i
never
could
get
anything
else
said
lady
eleanor
but
yorke
had
put
off
writing
he
would
not
have
admitted
it
to
himself
but
he
shrunk
from
writing
to
dolph
and
telling
him
that
he
the
duke
was
right
and
that
leslie
was
forgotten
forgotten
of
what
was
he
thinking
as
he
strode
through
the
country
lanes
as
he
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
silent
and
moody
but
of
leslie
always
leslie
the
time
comes
when
everybody
excepting
a
few
millions
leaves
london
shall
you
go
to
scotland
yorke
lady
eleanor
asked
she
knew
he
had
half
a
dozen
invitations
this
year
he
was
never
without
them
any
autumn
but
this
year
they
were
more
numerous
than
usual
yorke
auchester
running
loose
and
up
to
his
ears
in
debt
and
yorke
auchester
engaged
to
lady
eleanor
dallas
were
two
very
different
persons
and
by
a
singular
coincidence
everybody
who
had
a
house
and
a
moor
in
the
highlands
invited
him
but
he
said
he
would
not
go
to
scotland
i
tired
of
it
he
said
the
place
is
eaten
up
by
tourists
at
this
time
of
the
year
i
rather
stay
in
london
well
then
i
will
not
go
i
was
going
to
the
casaubon
but
i
will
send
an
excuse
oh
no
do
do
that
he
said
with
the
most
unselfish
alacrity
do
you
stay
up
in
town
for
my
sake
it
beastly
dull
now
i
know
lady
eleanor
thought
a
moment
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
she
said
aunt
and
i
will
go
to
white
place
it
is
just
a
nice
distance
from
town
and
and
if
you
should
ever
think
of
running
down
why
aunt
will
be
glad
to
see
you
sir
the
ladies
went
to
white
place
and
yorke
stayed
in
town
but
of
course
he
ran
down
to
the
big
house
very
frequently
and
when
he
went
he
was
made
much
of
as
was
only
right
and
natural
would
not
the
place
be
his
own
some
day
or
at
any
rate
would
he
not
be
the
lord
and
master
of
the
mistress
of
it
indeed
the
servants
received
him
as
if
he
were
already
master
and
understood
that
their
quickest
and
shortest
way
of
pleasing
their
mistress
was
by
winning
the
favor
of
this
handsome
lover
of
hers
everything
was
done
that
man
ah
and
woman
and
how
much
quicker
is
woman
could
do
to
amuse
and
please
him
a
stud
of
horses
filled
the
stables
his
own
being
the
most
honorably
housed
the
keepers
received
carte
blanche
as
to
the
game
a
suite
of
rooms
in
the
best
position
and
so
luxuriously
furnished
that
poor
yorke
laughed
grimly
when
he
first
entered
them
was
set
apart
for
him
lady
eleanor
would
have
filled
the
house
with
guests
but
it
seemed
that
yorke
was
not
in
the
humor
for
company
which
is
so
nice
and
sweet
of
him
murmured
lady
eleanor
his
favorite
wine
had
been
brought
down
from
london
and
the
cook
had
a
list
of
the
dishes
to
which
his
lordship
was
most
partial
happy
if
he
was
not
happy
he
was
the
most
ungrateful
man
among
the
sons
of
them
you
are
spoiling
him
my
dear
lady
denby
ventured
to
remonstrate
gently
it
was
the
morning
that
lady
eleanor
had
given
orders
for
a
special
wire
from
the
station
to
the
house
so
that
his
highness
might
let
them
know
when
he
was
coming
you
are
spoiling
him
all
you
know
how
and
that
always
a
bad
thing
for
a
man
especially
before
marriage
because
you
see
when
he
is
married
he
will
expect
to
be
spoiled
a
great
deal
more
and
you
have
left
yourself
any
room
i
dare
say
lady
eleanor
retorted
i
do
care
besides
it
true
you
ca
spoil
yorke
do
you
mean
that
nature
has
done
it
for
you
already
said
lady
denby
sweetly
nature
flashed
lady
eleanor
her
face
flushing
proudly
nature
spoiled
him
oh
where
is
there
a
handsomer
man
a
stronger
a
finer
than
my
yorke
my
dear
you
are
a
raving
lunatic
remarked
lady
denby
in
despair
certainly
if
he
were
being
spoiled
yorke
did
not
grow
less
careful
in
his
devoirs
he
was
as
ready
as
on
the
day
of
his
engagement
to
attend
his
betrothed
and
when
they
walked
and
drove
together
he
was
always
close
at
her
side
and
never
wanting
in
those
attentions
which
the
woman
finds
so
precious
when
they
are
paid
by
the
man
she
loves
and
with
it
all
she
watched
him
so
closely
was
so
careful
not
to
bore
him
in
the
matter
of
business
for
instance
most
women
having
so
much
money
would
have
wanted
to
talk
over
with
her
future
husband
this
investment
and
the
other
but
lady
eleanor
knew
yorke
better
than
to
attempt
anything
of
the
kind
ralph
duncombe
still
remained
her
guide
philosopher
and
friend
in
business
matters
and
it
was
understood
between
ralph
duncombe
and
her
without
a
word
having
passed
that
his
name
was
never
to
be
mentioned
in
lord
auchester
hearing
and
that
they
were
never
to
meet
one
day
however
the
day
yorke
had
galloped
past
lucy
in
the
lane
they
had
very
nearly
met
face
to
face
for
ralph
duncombe
had
left
the
house
only
a
few
moments
before
yorke
had
entered
yorke
had
come
down
from
london
for
a
few
hours
and
had
ridden
with
lady
eleanor
and
she
had
thought
that
he
was
going
to
remain
for
dinner
but
quite
suddenly
he
had
announced
that
he
must
get
back
to
town
once
or
twice
lately
he
had
had
similar
fits
of
restlessness
and
had
come
and
gone
unexpectedly
lady
eleanor
did
not
press
him
to
stay
his
chains
even
now
should
be
covered
with
velvet
and
he
had
ridden
off
having
arranged
to
leave
his
horse
at
the
station
to
be
fetched
by
a
groom
he
trotted
down
the
drive
quietly
enough
looking
back
once
or
twice
to
smile
and
wave
his
hand
at
lady
eleanor
who
stood
on
the
steps
watching
him
but
once
out
of
sight
he
stuck
the
spurs
into
the
horse
and
the
animal
bounded
off
like
a
shot
from
a
gun
and
as
he
tore
across
the
lawns
and
down
the
road
the
devil
that
sat
behind
yorke
auchester
taunted
and
upbraided
him
after
the
manner
of
devils
you
ungrateful
hound
why
ca
you
be
happy
why
ca
you
rest
and
be
content
you
are
going
to
marry
one
of
the
loveliest
women
in
england
you
are
going
to
be
rich
rich
you
who
had
a
penny
have
a
penny
of
your
own
you
are
envied
by
every
man
who
knows
you
and
thousands
who
do
but
have
only
read
of
you
in
the
papers
what
do
you
want
man
what
do
you
want
and
all
yorke
could
answer
with
a
groan
was
one
more
moonlit
night
at
portmaris
with
leslie
by
my
side
leslie
leslie
the
horse
was
in
a
lather
when
they
reached
the
station
but
his
master
was
not
tired
that
was
one
of
his
troubles
the
difficulty
of
getting
tired
enough
to
be
sleepy
and
directly
he
got
to
town
he
set
off
walking
and
the
devil
of
unrest
trudged
behind
him
as
he
had
sat
behind
him
on
the
horse
he
yorke
and
the
demon
with
him
turned
into
the
club
at
last
and
yorke
ordered
some
dinner
the
footman
brought
him
the
carte
de
jour
but
yorke
flicked
it
from
him
bring
me
what
you
like
he
said
indifferently
and
he
was
eating
it
as
indifferently
when
lord
vinson
sauntered
up
halloo
auchester
he
said
yorke
nodded
absently
not
to
say
surlily
all
alone
i
join
you
he
sat
down
and
after
studying
the
carte
with
devout
attention
ordered
his
dinner
and
then
having
disposed
of
his
soup
wanted
to
talk
just
seen
finetta
he
said
yorke
looked
up
swiftly
but
said
nothing
and
vinson
went
on
as
he
picked
the
bones
from
his
red
mullet
my
soul
i
think
all
women
are
mad
i
do
indeed
why
said
yorke
he
was
bound
to
say
something
why
take
fin
for
instance
there
she
is
at
the
top
of
the
tree
earning
thousands
a
year
a
regular
popular
favorite
and
hang
me
if
she
does
shirk
her
work
at
the
theater
three
days
out
of
six
and
actually
talk
about
cutting
the
shop
altogether
seems
to
have
lost
her
senses
lately
and
she
used
to
be
so
cute
at
one
time
eh
yorke
said
nothing
but
bowed
at
his
plate
by
the
way
you
and
she
have
had
a
row
have
you
said
vinson
after
a
moment
or
two
a
row
no
why
oh
well
i
did
know
but
when
i
mentioned
your
name
the
other
day
she
just
flared
up
in
a
way
to
make
a
man
see
stars
awful
i
know
what
she
is
going
to
do
to
you
she
welcome
to
do
all
she
likes
when
she
likes
and
how
she
likes
said
yorke
fiercely
for
god
sake
talk
of
something
else
now
when
a
man
is
told
to
talk
of
something
else
he
usually
obeys
by
talking
of
nothing
and
vinson
made
haste
with
his
dinner
and
left
the
table
muttering
something
about
wanting
to
see
the
evening
papers
seems
to
me
that
auchester
is
going
out
of
his
mind
he
said
to
a
friend
and
he
nodded
behind
the
paper
toward
yorke
snapped
me
up
just
now
as
if
he
meant
to
knock
my
head
off
too
much
luck
what
the
matter
who
the
favorite
for
the
sweepstakes
eh
he
unfolded
the
paper
as
he
spoke
and
glanced
down
the
columns
and
as
he
did
so
he
uttered
an
exclamation
what
the
matter
with
you
demanded
his
friend
hush
whispered
vinson
and
he
clutched
the
man
arm
and
led
him
to
a
part
of
the
room
out
of
reach
of
yorke
glowering
eyes
by
great
goodness
talk
of
luck
look
here
oh
moses
did
you
ever
let
me
see
said
his
friend
impatiently
you
clutch
that
paper
as
if
what
is
it
eh
oh
they
both
stared
at
the
paragraph
to
which
vinson
pointed
in
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
then
vinson
said
in
a
whisper
do
you
think
he
has
seen
it
not
he
do
you
think
he
would
sit
like
that
retorted
the
other
man
then
then
we
ought
to
break
it
to
him
eh
said
vinson
by
george
i
do
half
like
the
job
here
you
come
with
me
they
both
approached
the
table
and
yorke
nodded
to
the
other
man
but
did
not
extend
a
warmer
greeting
not
in
scotland
old
man
said
vinson
quaking
a
little
what
do
you
mean
demanded
yorke
glaring
at
him
i
here
as
you
see
not
even
yachting
er
er
when
did
you
see
lord
eustace
last
your
uncle
you
know
yorke
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
he
thought
they
had
lost
their
senses
what
he
said
impatiently
when
did
i
see
why
do
you
ask
oh
show
it
to
him
said
vinson
desperately
i
told
you
i
should
mull
it
the
other
man
held
the
paper
to
yorke
and
pointed
to
a
paragraph
and
yorke
taking
it
and
not
too
courteously
out
of
his
hand
read
this
we
regret
to
announce
the
death
of
lord
eustace
auchester
and
his
two
sons
his
lordship
was
yachting
in
the
mediterranean
and
the
vessel
being
overtaken
by
a
sudden
squall
capsized
their
lordships
and
the
crew
four
in
number
were
all
lost
lord
eustace
auchester
was
the
heir
to
the
dukedom
of
rothbury
which
will
now
descend
to
his
nephew
lord
yorke
auchester
yorke
gazed
at
the
printed
words
for
a
time
as
if
he
failed
to
grasp
their
significance
then
his
face
paled
paled
slowly
till
it
was
white
as
death
hold
up
old
man
said
vinson
dash
it
all
i
wish
i
broken
it
better
here
take
some
wine
but
yorke
pushing
the
wine
from
him
rose
the
paper
still
in
his
hand
and
as
if
he
had
forgotten
the
presence
of
the
two
men
stared
wildly
before
him
then
to
their
horror
he
broke
into
a
hoarse
laugh
why
she
should
have
waited
he
exclaimed
bitterly
and
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
himself
yes
if
she
had
waited
she
would
have
been
a
duchess
after
all
chapter
xxxv
the
heir
apparent
yorke
walked
straight
out
of
the
club
leaving
the
two
men
staring
at
each
other
in
amazement
good
lord
poor
auchester
is
clean
off
his
balance
do
you
think
it
is
the
shock
that
it
was
because
we
did
not
break
it
gently
enough
the
other
man
shook
his
head
i
do
think
so
he
been
very
queer
in
his
manner
lately
and
but
who
the
devil
did
he
mean
when
he
said
might
have
been
a
duchess
yorke
strode
along
pall
mall
bewildered
and
stunned
at
first
he
was
too
confused
to
feel
anything
then
regret
and
grief
came
uppermost
he
was
genuinely
sorry
you
may
dislike
your
uncle
and
cousins
and
yet
be
far
from
wishing
them
dead
and
yorke
eyes
were
moist
and
there
was
a
lump
in
his
throat
as
he
thought
of
his
three
kinsmen
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
mediterranean
then
he
began
to
realize
what
their
unexpected
and
tragic
death
meant
to
him
there
was
only
dolph
between
him
and
the
dukedom
and
poor
dolph
could
not
make
old
bones
and
as
it
bore
down
upon
him
with
its
full
significance
the
terrible
bitterness
which
had
overwhelmed
him
at
the
club
recurred
the
turn
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
had
come
too
late
if
it
had
happened
a
month
five
weeks
earlier
he
would
not
have
been
driven
into
a
corner
the
only
way
out
of
which
was
by
a
marriage
with
eleanor
dallas
too
late
he
muttered
yes
if
it
had
come
sooner
i
might
have
kept
leslie
but
his
heart
revolted
against
his
thought
and
he
swore
under
his
breath
no
no
it
was
the
title
she
wanted
not
me
it
is
better
that
she
has
gone
he
went
home
and
saw
by
fleming
face
that
he
had
heard
the
sad
news
poor
fleming
tried
to
look
cut
up
but
it
was
hard
work
seeing
that
he
had
been
saying
to
himself
since
the
moment
he
had
read
the
paragraph
my
master
will
be
a
duke
dreadful
news
my
lord
he
said
in
the
tone
proper
to
the
occasion
yes
yes
fleming
said
yorke
gravely
your
lordship
will
go
over
i
suppose
yorke
started
slightly
he
had
not
as
yet
thought
of
this
his
obvious
duty
yes
he
said
get
some
things
ready
and
look
out
the
yes
my
lord
your
lordship
will
go
down
to
white
place
first
suggested
fleming
respectfully
yorke
hesitated
but
he
assented
i
to
go
abroad
with
you
my
lord
said
fleming
tentatively
and
yorke
nodded
you
can
if
you
like
just
as
you
like
he
said
thank
you
my
lord
i
will
go
said
fleming
your
lordship
may
want
things
done
and
i
may
be
useful
you
are
always
that
yorke
said
and
it
was
just
such
simple
expressions
of
appreciation
as
this
that
won
the
regard
and
devotion
of
fleming
and
his
kind
yorke
went
off
to
white
place
that
night
he
was
tired
but
he
could
not
sleep
in
the
train
though
he
tried
his
mind
was
too
overburdened
with
thought
late
as
it
was
the
ladies
were
up
and
they
had
heard
the
news
from
a
servant
who
had
brought
an
evening
paper
from
town
its
effect
upon
lady
eleanor
was
strange
and
puzzled
lady
denby
at
first
for
lady
eleanor
let
the
paper
drop
from
her
hand
and
stood
staring
before
her
with
an
expression
in
her
eyes
which
was
rather
that
of
some
vague
dread
than
sorrow
lady
denby
went
to
her
and
drew
her
to
a
couch
it
is
terribly
sudden
and
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
being
upset
dear
she
said
but
what
is
it
eleanor
you
are
not
going
to
faint
for
lady
eleanor
had
swayed
and
fallen
back
with
the
look
of
dread
still
in
her
eyes
she
recovered
after
a
moment
and
the
tears
came
oh
poor
things
poor
things
oh
it
is
dreadful
but
god
forgive
me
it
was
not
of
them
i
was
thinking
but
of
of
yorke
and
myself
of
yorke
said
lady
denby
puzzled
still
yes
said
lady
eleanor
in
a
low
and
voice
do
you
see
the
the
wedding
must
be
put
off
now
lady
denby
stroked
her
hand
soothingly
yes
of
course
dear
but
there
is
nothing
in
that
to
frighten
you
for
you
look
frightened
eleanor
seems
like
like
a
judgment
on
me
as
if
heaven
were
angry
and
meant
to
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
oh
my
dear
eleanor
yes
you
do
know
you
do
understand
what
i
feel
and
i
felt
so
happy
so
safe
and
now
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
necessary
to
put
it
off
lady
denby
was
very
nearly
shocked
the
suddenness
of
this
terrible
news
has
upset
you
eleanor
she
said
gravely
but
for
heaven
sake
do
talk
so
so
callously
you
do
not
know
repeated
lady
eleanor
with
a
deep
sigh
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
feel
for
them
ah
yes
i
do
keenly
as
keenly
as
you
can
but
but
it
is
as
if
it
were
fated
that
something
should
occur
to
prevent
our
marriage
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
she
said
as
if
to
herself
he
will
be
the
duke
i
am
sorry
sorry
lady
denby
stared
at
her
yes
said
lady
eleanor
in
the
same
low
reflective
voice
yes
i
would
rather
he
was
what
he
is
and
and
poor
i
would
rather
that
he
owed
everything
to
me
now
now
it
will
be
i
who
will
owe
much
to
him
that
is
as
fine
a
sample
of
pride
as
i
have
ever
met
with
said
lady
denby
is
it
said
lady
eleanor
you
do
not
know
or
understand
do
you
think
she
looked
up
with
a
look
of
pain
in
her
beautiful
eyes
do
you
think
that
if
he
were
free
he
would
wish
me
now
to
be
his
wife
eleanor
i
have
often
said
in
jest
that
your
affection
for
yorke
was
undermining
your
reason
but
in
solemn
truth
i
begin
to
think
that
there
is
some
truth
in
my
assertion
dry
your
eyes
and
compose
yourself
he
will
be
here
presently
he
is
sure
to
come
the
moment
he
hears
the
news
he
will
have
to
go
over
and
see
about
the
funeral
no
no
why
should
he
said
lady
eleanor
then
she
flushed
as
if
with
shame
yes
yes
of
course
and
you
think
he
will
come
there
he
is
said
lady
denby
as
they
heard
yorke
step
in
the
hall
for
heaven
sake
do
breathe
to
him
the
charming
sentiments
you
have
favored
me
with
lady
eleanor
shook
her
head
and
bit
her
lips
to
bring
the
color
into
them
do
not
fear
she
said
it
is
only
when
i
am
alone
or
with
you
that
i
show
my
doubts
and
fears
yorke
came
in
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
you
have
heard
the
news
eleanor
i
see
he
said
gravely
yes
it
is
dreadful
dreadful
to
think
that
all
three
should
be
gone
those
two
poor
boys
you
are
going
over
yorke
for
he
had
got
on
his
traveling
ulster
yes
i
am
going
to
meet
fleming
at
charing
cross
morning
i
shall
have
to
go
back
at
once
at
once
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
so
far
just
to
say
but
you
are
always
good
to
me
yorke
and
she
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
this
this
will
make
a
difference
to
you
dearest
he
did
not
affect
not
to
understand
her
yes
he
said
simply
two
days
ago
there
seemed
little
chance
of
my
being
the
duke
of
rothbury
now
but
i
hope
and
trust
dear
old
dolph
will
live
to
be
a
hundred
and
i
and
i
she
responded
fervently
i
would
rather
have
you
as
you
are
yorke
far
far
rather
i
afraid
that
this
sad
affair
will
delay
our
marriage
eleanor
he
said
and
he
said
it
as
regretfully
as
he
could
yes
she
whispered
her
face
still
hidden
on
his
shoulder
yes
it
must
i
suppose
but
he
could
almost
feel
her
blush
but
not
for
long
she
asked
nearly
inaudibly
i
do
know
he
stammered
i
we
shall
see
i
must
find
dolph
he
was
in
switzerland
but
i
think
it
is
very
likely
that
he
has
moved
down
south
with
the
cooler
weather
he
will
be
cut
up
he
liked
poor
eustace
better
than
any
of
us
did
i
must
go
now
dear
he
said
presently
so
soon
yes
i
am
afraid
so
is
there
anything
you
want
me
to
do
anything
i
can
tell
dolph
she
shook
her
head
there
is
only
one
thing
i
want
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
that
is
you
come
back
as
soon
the
first
moment
you
can
yorke
and
and
do
forget
me
he
would
have
been
a
far
worse
man
than
he
was
if
he
had
not
been
touched
by
the
depth
of
her
love
and
he
kissed
her
with
greater
warmth
than
he
had
ever
before
shown
her
when
he
had
gone
lady
eleanor
threw
herself
down
on
the
sofa
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
lady
denby
when
she
came
in
an
hour
later
found
her
thus
do
it
as
luxuriously
as
you
may
the
journey
from
england
to
the
south
of
italy
is
a
tiresome
and
aggravating
one
and
yorke
reached
policastro
the
place
at
which
the
bodies
were
lying
worn
out
mentally
and
physically
it
was
fortunate
that
the
devoted
fleming
had
accompanied
him
and
never
did
his
devotion
display
itself
more
plainly
or
to
better
advantage
there
were
a
number
of
persons
busybodies
there
who
would
have
surrounded
lord
auchester
at
once
the
whole
coast
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
over
the
catastrophe
but
fleming
kept
them
at
bay
and
insisted
upon
his
master
taking
some
rest
before
he
commenced
the
painful
duties
necessitated
by
the
circumstances
his
lordship
is
going
to
see
any
one
he
assured
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
not
if
it
was
the
king
of
italy
himself
if
anybody
wants
to
know
anything
let
them
come
to
me
the
landlord
only
half
understood
but
he
was
considerably
awed
by
fleming
tone
and
departed
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
spreading
out
his
hands
after
the
manner
of
his
nation
in
the
morning
yorke
went
and
identified
the
bodies
and
arranged
for
the
funeral
and
was
returning
to
the
hotel
when
he
met
grey
the
duke
valet
his
grace
has
just
arrived
my
lord
i
came
to
meet
you
he
said
i
hope
your
lordship
is
well
he
added
respectfully
and
with
rather
a
serious
glance
at
yorke
face
yorke
nodded
all
right
thank
you
grey
he
said
and
the
duke
grey
hesitated
about
as
well
as
usual
i
hope
my
lord
he
said
quietly
this
sad
affair
has
upset
him
of
course
and
and
he
has
been
very
strong
lately
not
since
we
left
england
indeed
my
lord
your
lordship
will
find
him
looking
thinner
he
added
as
if
to
warn
yorke
yorke
quickened
his
pace
and
grey
led
him
to
the
duke
room
the
room
was
darkened
by
the
drawn
blinds
and
yorke
coming
out
of
the
sunlight
saw
but
indistinctly
for
a
moment
then
as
the
duke
raised
himself
on
the
couch
he
started
and
found
speech
difficult
the
duke
was
but
a
shadow
of
even
his
former
self
and
the
hand
which
he
extended
was
so
thin
that
yorke
was
afraid
to
press
it
why
dolph
he
said
with
forced
cheerfulness
this
is
a
surprise
how
did
you
come
here
we
have
been
traveling
night
and
day
as
you
have
no
doubt
said
the
duke
and
his
voice
sounded
much
thinner
and
more
feeble
than
when
yorke
had
last
heard
it
pull
up
an
inch
or
two
of
one
of
the
blinds
and
let
me
look
at
you
yorke
did
so
and
came
back
to
the
couch
and
the
duke
after
scanning
his
face
fell
back
with
a
faint
sigh
and
so
you
are
going
to
be
the
next
duke
after
all
how
you
and
i
have
fretted
no
i
do
know
that
you
ever
cared
much
but
i
did
and
it
has
all
come
right
at
last
the
providence
that
our
ends
them
as
we
will
has
decreed
that
poor
eustace
and
his
boys
should
go
down
there
in
the
bay
and
that
you
should
reign
in
his
place
i
wish
they
were
all
alive
still
said
yorke
with
sincerity
i
know
you
do
responded
the
duke
but
i
ca
help
thinking
as
i
have
always
thought
that
you
will
make
a
good
duke
yorke
you
have
the
presence
and
the
moral
strength
and
a
better
temper
than
poor
eustace
he
was
too
fond
of
his
money
but
of
the
dead
let
us
speak
nothing
but
good
and
now
about
yourself
why
did
you
not
write
and
tell
me
of
your
engagement
never
mind
i
understand
and
if
i
did
not
write
and
tell
you
i
was
glad
you
knew
it
without
any
epistolatory
assurance
from
me
you
have
done
wisely
yorke
very
wisely
eleanor
has
everything
that
a
man
wants
in
a
wife
youth
beauty
wealth
and
station
she
will
make
a
splendid
duchess
yorke
yes
said
yorke
staring
at
the
carpet
moodily
i
suppose
i
must
hang
on
until
you
are
married
said
the
duke
as
cheerfully
and
coolly
as
if
he
were
talking
of
somebody
else
once
or
twice
lately
i
have
been
inclined
to
throw
up
the
sponge
but
somehow
i
got
a
hankering
to
see
you
settled
and
then
i
suppose
i
shall
want
to
live
long
enough
to
take
the
next
heir
on
my
knee
men
are
never
satisfied
but
i
do
suppose
i
shall
be
able
to
hold
out
till
then
for
heaven
sake
do
talk
such
arrant
nonsense
yorke
said
emphatically
you
are
no
worse
than
you
were
the
duke
smiled
at
him
calmly
but
significantly
my
dear
fellow
i
am
hanging
on
to
life
by
my
eyelashes
he
said
in
a
tone
you
must
get
back
to
england
as
quickly
as
possible
said
yorke
trying
to
speak
in
an
assured
and
perfectly
confident
voice
there
is
nothing
like
england
in
the
winter
after
all
come
back
and
let
eleanor
nurse
you
that
an
inducement
certainly
said
the
duke
eleanor
and
i
were
always
good
friends
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
then
the
duke
after
glancing
once
or
twice
at
yorke
grave
face
said
in
a
low
voice
that
faltered
there
there
is
no
news
of
of
he
stopped
of
whom
said
yorke
with
a
frown
though
he
knew
well
enough
of
leslie
said
the
duke
and
a
faint
flush
passed
over
his
emaciated
face
yorke
shook
his
head
no
he
replied
clearing
his
throat
no
i
have
seen
nothing
and
heard
nothing
of
her
since
i
left
portmaris
she
must
have
gone
out
of
england
said
the
duke
knitting
his
brows
her
father
being
an
artist
as
he
thinks
himself
poor
fellow
would
be
ready
enough
to
come
abroad
here
on
the
continent
it
is
strange
that
i
have
not
run
across
them
yorke
said
nothing
but
the
frown
on
his
forehead
deepened
and
darkened
when
i
shuffle
off
this
mortal
coil
you
will
find
in
my
will
that
i
have
mentioned
leslie
he
paused
before
the
name
you
wo
mind
yorke
she
would
take
any
money
from
me
alive
but
she
may
not
mind
when
i
gone
after
all
it
was
a
cruel
trick
we
no
i
played
her
yorke
he
said
in
a
remorseful
tone
it
was
said
yorke
curtly
but
it
was
a
test
and
she
failed
in
it
the
duke
sighed
silence
again
for
a
moment
or
two
then
as
if
he
were
giving
speech
to
a
thought
that
had
occurred
to
him
before
and
often
before
this
he
said
hesitatingly
do
you
think
mind
i
only
ask
you
the
question
for
the
sake
of
asking
it
i
have
no
reason
for
doing
so
but
do
you
think
that
there
was
the
slightest
chance
of
our
having
made
a
mistake
what
do
you
mean
demanded
yorke
i
mean
well
it
is
difficult
to
say
exactly
what
i
mean
but
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
know
how
sick
men
brood
and
brood
over
a
thing
you
see
we
have
so
much
time
on
our
hands
lying
on
our
backs
and
counting
the
flies
on
the
ceiling
that
we
think
over
things
a
great
deal
more
closely
than
men
in
sound
health
and
and
at
times
a
doubt
has
crossed
my
mind
he
stopped
there
is
no
ground
for
it
i
am
sure
i
could
not
have
been
mistaken
she
spoke
only
too
plainly
the
morning
we
parted
besides
there
is
the
fact
of
her
breaking
her
appointment
with
you
of
leaving
you
without
a
word
beyond
the
message
she
sent
by
me
and
the
message
she
sent
by
arnheim
i
met
him
the
other
day
and
he
gave
it
to
me
i
went
off
too
quickly
on
the
other
occasion
for
him
to
do
so
it
was
like
that
she
sent
by
you
she
wished
to
see
me
no
more
said
yorke
grimly
yes
yes
there
could
be
no
mistake
and
yet
well
i
have
lain
and
thought
of
her
as
she
was
when
we
first
met
her
do
you
remember
yorke
smiled
grimly
did
he
remember
so
girlish
and
innocent
so
quick
to
be
pleased
and
so
grateful
he
sighed
yes
sometimes
it
has
seemed
impossible
to
me
that
she
should
have
been
so
base
and
mercenary
but
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
you
say
and
mind
i
should
not
have
said
this
if
you
had
still
been
unsettled
and
hankering
after
her
but
now
do
say
it
now
either
broke
out
yorke
springing
to
his
feet
and
pacing
up
and
down
for
god
sake
do
talk
of
of
that
time
or
of
her
i
i
ca
bear
it
i
beg
your
pardon
dolph
but
do
you
see
do
you
understand
that
though
a
man
may
cover
up
his
wound
and
cease
to
complain
the
heart
may
sting
and
ache
still
i
want
to
forget
to
forget
and
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
but
there
be
i
got
to
shut
my
eyes
and
ears
to
it
to
put
it
away
from
me
if
i
did
not
if
i
entertained
it
for
a
moment
well
he
stopped
and
laughed
bitterly
that
way
madness
lies
you
and
i
had
better
agree
to
taboo
the
subject
the
sound
of
her
name
how
soon
can
we
leave
this
place
he
broke
off
the
duke
sighed
you
must
get
back
as
quickly
as
possible
he
said
eleanor
will
miss
you
the
wedding
need
not
be
put
off
very
long
you
are
already
practically
the
duke
i
shall
pass
over
all
the
business
of
the
estate
to
you
at
once
and
it
is
right
and
fitting
that
you
should
be
married
the
world
will
see
that
three
months
too
will
be
long
enough
to
wait
the
wedding
can
be
a
perfectly
quiet
one
very
well
said
yorke
dully
settle
it
as
you
like
yes
it
ca
be
too
soon
said
the
duke
thoughtfully
you
got
to
consider
me
you
know
and
he
laughed
look
here
my
lord
you
may
as
well
begin
to
take
the
burden
on
your
shoulders
give
me
that
there
are
some
letters
grey
has
been
bothering
me
about
it
is
something
about
the
trees
in
the
home
park
at
rothbury
cut
down
or
let
stand
just
as
you
think
proper
they
will
be
yours

chapter
xxxvi
the
new
love
a
fortnight
later
lucy
was
returning
from
a
rather
lengthy
ramble
she
had
a
companion
one
of
the
this
being
the
universal
holiday
saturday
afternoon
and
they
both
carried
a
basket
full
of
roots
and
leaves
for
whenever
lucy
went
out
she
managed
to
bring
home
something
for
planting
in
the
little
garden
of
which
she
and
leslie
were
so
fond
and
proud
i
hope
you
not
getting
tired
jenny
she
said
to
the
girl
who
tripped
on
proudly
beside
her
oh
no
miss
lucy
well
i
glad
you
are
not
remarked
lucy
for
we
are
a
long
way
from
home
yet
and
it
is
going
to
rain
added
jenny
with
that
placid
indifference
to
the
weather
which
distinguishes
country
children
what
and
i
have
brought
no
umbrella
and
you
have
only
that
thin
cloak
jenny
but
perhaps
you
are
wrong
i
always
notice
that
when
people
say
it
is
going
to
rain
it
invariably
turns
out
fine
perhaps
for
weeks
it
going
to
rain
now
miss
lucy
repeated
jenny
still
more
confidently
and
a
moment
or
two
afterward
she
added
there
lucy
felt
a
spot
on
her
face
and
seized
the
girl
basket
you
must
let
me
carry
this
jenny
because
we
shall
have
to
hurry
all
we
know
it
will
never
do
to
go
in
wet
through
what
would
miss
leslie
say
this
formula
which
she
found
of
great
service
when
admonishing
the
children
lent
speed
to
jenny
small
feet
and
lucy
and
she
hurried
along
the
road
but
quickly
as
they
went
the
rain
caught
them
up
and
presently
it
came
down
in
a
torrent
jenny
laughed
and
lucy
being
rather
careful
of
her
clothes
and
inclined
to
take
matters
seriously
was
constrained
to
laugh
too
we
must
get
under
a
tree
she
said
there
squeeze
up
against
the
trunk
and
i
will
stand
in
front
of
you
and
shelter
you
as
well
as
i
can
oh
what
would
i
give
for
an
umbrella
jenny
leaned
against
the
tree
and
amused
herself
by
twisting
a
spray
of
brown
ivy
leaves
into
a
wreath
and
looking
up
at
the
weather
now
and
again
and
lucy
was
rapidly
sinking
into
that
condition
which
such
circumstances
produce
when
she
heard
the
rattle
of
a
cart
coming
along
the
road
jenny
there
is
a
cart
and
i
believe
it
is
going
to
newfold
she
said
with
a
sudden
hopefulness
perhaps
it
is
someone
we
know
one
of
the
tradespeople
if
so
we
will
ask
them
to
give
us
a
lift
they
wo
wait
to
be
asked
miss
lucy
said
jenny
shrewdly
and
indeed
truthfully
for
the
two
were
already
favorites
in
newfold
here
it
is
now
said
lucy
then
she
sighed
disappointedly
it
is
a
dog
cart
a
gentleman
she
said
bother
it
came
abreast
of
them
and
was
spinning
past
when
suddenly
the
gentleman
who
was
driving
seemed
to
see
them
and
after
a
hesitation
he
pulled
up
the
horse
you
must
stand
under
that
tree
he
called
out
lucy
colored
and
started
for
two
reasons
one
because
she
had
been
brought
up
in
habits
of
obedience
and
generally
did
what
she
was
told
no
matter
who
told
her
and
especially
if
the
order
was
issued
in
a
commanding
voice
and
this
was
a
commanding
voice
the
other
reason
was
that
she
recognized
the
voice
itself
it
was
the
gentleman
she
had
met
in
the
lane
and
to
whom
she
had
given
the
fern
root
come
away
he
said
gravely
then
he
appeared
to
recognise
her
for
he
jumped
down
and
still
holding
the
reins
came
forward
and
raised
his
hat
jenny
laughing
to
see
the
rain
pour
off
the
brim
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
did
not
see
who
it
was
for
a
moment
the
rain
is
pelting
so
but
all
the
same
you
really
must
not
stand
there
there
is
thunder
in
the
air
and
it
is
dangerous
standing
under
a
tree
lightning
you
know
lucy
uttered
a
little
cry
then
laughed
and
blushed
of
course
how
foolish
of
me
not
to
think
of
it
but
when
you
called
out
i
was
afraid
i
was
doing
some
injury
to
the
tree
by
trespassing
he
laughed
a
grave
short
kind
of
laugh
which
however
seemed
to
lucy
to
suit
him
somehow
how
wet
you
are
he
said
have
you
been
standing
here
long
ever
since
it
began
replied
lucy
with
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
a
trick
she
had
unconsciously
caught
from
leslie
and
we
are
waiting
till
it
stops
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
wait
a
long
time
he
remarked
it
has
set
for
a
wet
evening
may
i
ask
where
you
are
going
to
newfold
said
lucy
newfold
ah
yes
will
you
let
me
offer
you
a
lift
i
am
going
there
or
at
any
rate
very
near
there
as
far
as
the
london
road
goes
oh
no
thank
you
said
lucy
flushing
he
looked
disappointed
then
he
glanced
at
jenny
the
little
girl
is
getting
very
wet
she
will
take
a
chill
he
said
gravely
oh
do
you
think
so
exclaimed
lucy
with
instant
alarm
oh
dear
and
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
very
strong
it
does
in
the
least
matter
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
for
i
never
take
cold
i
am
used
to
the
country
and
rough
weather
but
jenny
jenny
grinned
at
the
idea
of
her
being
in
any
danger
from
an
autumn
storm
but
she
was
too
wise
to
make
any
remark
for
she
was
dying
for
a
ride
in
the
handsome
i
think
you
had
better
let
me
take
her
and
you
he
said
and
seeing
that
she
still
hesitated
he
cut
the
gordian
knot
by
lifting
jenny
into
the
cart
and
holding
out
his
hand
for
lucy
then
when
she
was
seated
he
got
out
a
big
carriage
umbrella
and
put
it
up
for
them
and
quickly
slipping
off
his
waterproof
arranged
it
on
the
seat
behind
so
that
it
completely
covered
them
oh
but
you
will
get
wet
remonstrated
lucy
much
distressed
but
he
laughed
and
made
light
of
the
business
we
londoners
like
getting
wet
sometimes
he
said
it
is
a
change
you
see
in
london
we
take
as
much
care
of
ourselves
as
if
a
spot
of
rain
would
kill
us
oh
i
know
said
lucy
with
shy
pride
i
have
lived
in
london
for
some
time
i
thought
you
said
you
were
used
to
the
country
he
remarked
so
i
am
i
was
born
in
the
country
lucy
explained
in
her
frank
simple
manner
a
manner
by
the
way
which
possesses
a
greater
charm
for
some
indeed
most
men
than
all
the
cultivated
artificialities
i
have
lived
all
my
life
she
said
all
my
life
as
if
she
were
at
least
ninety
in
the
country
until
i
went
up
to
london
to
cram
for
my
exam
your
he
said
invitingly
and
yet
not
obtrusively
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
interest
displayed
in
his
face
which
indicated
presumptuous
or
idle
curiosity
yes
said
lucy
blushing
faintly
i
am
a
teacher
a
governess
he
said
no
a
teacher
corrected
lucy
with
fine
emphasis
i
am
one
of
the
teachers
at
the
village
school
there
are
only
two
i
mean
teachers
i
am
the
second
and
do
you
like
being
a
teacher
he
asked
his
voice
was
as
grave
as
ever
but
the
expression
of
interest
seemed
increasing
the
pleasant
face
looked
so
pretty
and
innocent
and
girlish
under
the
shadow
of
the
big
umbrella
the
clear
low
voice
rang
so
true
and
sweet
it
seemed
to
the
weary
city
man
as
if
he
had
stopped
to
pick
up
one
of
the
wild
flowers
from
the
oh
yes
said
lucy
promptly
i
thought
so
by
the
way
you
spoke
he
said
with
a
smile
and
lucy
laughed
and
blushed
again
i
like
it
very
much
she
said
but
then
ours
is
such
a
nice
school
and
the
girls
are
all
such
good
girls
are
they
jenny
yes
miss
lucy
assented
jenny
from
under
the
wrap
into
which
she
had
nestled
eh
he
said
oh
but
she
is
really
a
very
good
girl
said
lucy
in
a
confidential
whisper
which
seemed
to
make
them
more
intimate
they
are
all
good
and
so
we
are
both
as
happy
as
we
can
be
we
both
he
said
i
mean
my
my
principal
said
lucy
miss
she
was
about
to
tell
him
the
name
but
stopped
remembering
that
he
was
a
stranger
and
that
leslie
might
not
like
to
be
so
confidential
about
herself
at
any
rate
i
am
very
glad
you
are
so
happy
he
said
do
you
know
i
had
been
on
the
point
of
visiting
your
school
you
said
lucy
opening
her
eyes
with
surprise
and
as
he
noticed
with
something
else
a
faint
but
unmistakable
pleasure
yes
he
said
it
belongs
to
a
lady
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
she
is
kind
enough
to
let
me
see
to
some
of
her
business
matters
the
kindness
seems
to
be
on
the
other
side
said
lucy
laughing
ralph
duncombe
colored
and
found
himself
laughing
too
well
he
said
let
us
say
we
are
both
kind
i
was
going
to
explain
that
she
had
asked
me
to
do
something
in
connection
with
the
school
i
forget
what
it
was
now
perhaps
it
was
the
roof
said
lucy
eagerly
it
is
rather
bad
in
one
or
two
places
and
the
other
morning
two
or
three
spots
of
water
came
through
oh
i
hope
it
was
the
roof
it
must
have
been
he
said
with
due
gravity
and
i
will
see
that
it
is
put
right
at
once
is
there
anything
else
that
wants
doing
miss
miss
lucy
i
think
you
said
your
name
was
yes
lucy
somes
she
said
thinking
hard
and
trying
to
remember
if
there
was
anything
else
wrong
at
her
beloved
school
i
think
there
is
anything
else
the
matter
excepting
the
roof
perhaps
i
had
better
come
and
see
for
myself
he
said
in
a
way
are
you
an
architect
lucy
inquired
rather
timidly
ralph
duncombe
smiled
no
i
am
nothing
nearly
so
clever
i
am
only
an
ordinary
business
man
very
hard
worked
and
very
glad
to
run
away
from
the
city
and
into
the
fresh
air
ah
yes
how
you
must
enjoy
it
said
lucy
with
a
sympathetic
little
sigh
to
get
away
from
the
crowd
and
the
heat
and
the
smoke
so
they
talked
and
as
ralph
duncombe
listened
to
the
sweet
young
voice
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
there
was
a
power
in
it
to
soothe
his
weary
restless
spirit
and
when
lucy
suddenly
exclaimed
as
if
she
were
quite
surprised
that
they
should
have
reached
the
spot
so
soon
why
here
is
the
corner
he
pulled
the
horse
up
with
evident
reluctance
i
drive
you
around
to
the
school
he
said
but
lucy
declined
and
so
earnestly
that
he
could
not
persist
he
lifted
them
down
and
cut
short
lucy
blushing
thanks
it
is
i
who
ought
to
be
and
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
miss
somes
he
said
for
you
have
made
one
part
of
my
lonely
drive
very
pleasant
i
hope
you
wo
be
any
the
worse
for
your
wetting
oh
but
i
am
as
dry
as
a
bone
and
so
is
jenny
said
lucy
blushing
still
more
and
you
will
not
forget
the
roof
no
no
he
said
but
i
must
come
and
see
it
myself
he
sat
bolt
upright
in
the
cart
watching
them
as
they
ran
along
the
road
shining
with
the
rain
and
a
strange
feeling
took
possession
of
him
how
lonely
he
had
been
before
he
saw
them
how
lonely
all
his
life
was
he
was
rich
fearfully
rich
and
yet
there
was
not
a
streak
of
sunshine
in
his
life
his
love
for
leslie
lisle
had
clouded
it
over
as
with
a
pall
oh
why
had
the
fates
dealt
with
him
so
unkindly
why
had
he
not
given
his
heart
to
some
girl
like
the
one
who
had
just
left
him
one
who
would
have
returned
his
love
and
borne
for
him
the
sweet
name
of
wife
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
ralph
duncombe
found
himself
thinking
tenderly
and
wistfully
of
some
other
woman
than
leslie
lisle
he
thought
of
her
several
times
the
next
day
her
sweet
girlish
face
came
between
him
and
a
most
important
letter
he
was
writing
and
once
during
the
morning
his
chief
clerk
came
in
and
found
him
the
great
city
man
sitting
with
his
head
leaning
on
his
hands
and
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
on
the
window
when
saturday
came
around
again
he
remembered
that
he
must
go
round
to
white
place
to
see
lady
eleanor
he
had
the
horse
harnessed
and
drove
along
the
road
light
now
with
the
autumn
sunshine
and
every
inch
of
the
way
he
thought
of
lucy
when
in
the
afternoon
he
reached
the
corner
where
he
had
set
her
and
jenny
down
he
pulled
up
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
turned
the
corner
and
drove
to
the
school
and
his
heart
beat
as
it
had
not
beaten
since
he
said
to
leslie
as
he
saw
lucy
girlish
figure
in
the
garden
she
wore
a
plain
cotton
frock
a
big
sun
hat
much
battered
and
sunburned
was
on
her
head
and
the
prettiest
and
most
useless
of
rakes
in
her
hand
she
almost
dropped
this
apology
for
a
tool
when
she
saw
him
and
the
color
ran
up
her
cheeks
as
she
came
to
the
gate
you
have
come
to
see
the
roof
she
said
that
is
kind
of
you
yes
i
have
come
to
see
the
roof
he
said
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
but
he
could
scarcely
say
he
had
come
to
see
her
i
am
so
sorry
said
lucy
but
my
friend
the
principal
you
know
is
out
she
does
not
often
leave
the
house
and
garden
even
for
an
hour
excepting
to
go
to
church
but
i
persuaded
her
to
go
down
to
the
village
this
afternoon
i
am
so
very
sorry
so
am
i
responded
ralph
with
mendacious
politeness
may
i
come
in
oh
yes
please
said
lucy
but
the
horse
he
will
stand
till
this
day
week
said
ralph
but
i
hitch
the
reins
over
the
palings
all
the
same
this
way
said
lucy
eagerly
and
she
led
him
to
the
he
stared
up
at
the
very
small
hole
in
the
roof
with
the
deepest
gravity
apparently
but
in
reality
he
was
thinking
how
sweetly
pretty
the
face
beside
him
looked
as
she
upturned
to
gaze
aloft
all
right
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
see
that
it
is
put
straight
you
are
sure
there
is
nothing
else
said
lucy
nothing
oh
yes
the
gate
to
the
meadow
is
so
very
old
that
that
the
donkey
in
the
next
field
pushes
it
open
and
let
us
go
in
and
see
it
said
ralph
promptly
we
may
as
well
do
everything
that
wants
doing
at
once
they
went
to
the
meadow
and
he
examined
the
gate
and
admired
the
view
across
the
fields
and
on
lucy
telling
him
it
was
much
better
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
wandered
off
in
that
direction
and
somehow
or
other
they
found
themselves
sitting
on
the
stile
that
led
into
the
plantation
and
talking
as
lucy
put
it
afterward
like
old
friends
so
much
so
indeed
that
it
was
with
quite
a
start
that
lucy
heard
the
clock
strike
five
oh
i
have
not
offered
you
any
tea
she
exclaimed
remorsefully
please
come
into
the
my
friend
will
be
back
by
this
time
and
she
will
be
quite
angry
at
my
want
of
hospitality
ralph
picturing
to
himself
a
as
the
glanced
at
his
watch
hesitatingly
but
seeing
a
look
of
disappointment
beginning
to
cloud
lucy
face
rose
promptly
why
should
he
not
go
in
to
tea
with
her
it
was
the
last
time
he
would
see
her
having
an
opportunity
of
listening
to
the
sweet
young
voice
and
at
the
thought
a
sudden
pang
shot
through
his
heart
he
had
spent
his
life
following
a
leslie
lisle
even
if
he
found
her
could
never
be
his
why
should
he
not
ask
this
pretty
girl
lucy
he
said
suddenly
and
yet
gently
she
started
at
the
sound
of
the
christian
name
and
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
questioningly
do
be
frightened
he
said
still
more
gently
but
with
an
earnest
gravity
that
thrilled
her
and
yet
i
am
afraid
i
shall
frighten
you
do
you
know
what
it
is
i
am
going
to
ask
you
no
you
can
not
guess
lucy
since
last
saturday
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
every
day
of
me
the
words
left
her
lips
in
a
whisper
and
the
color
deepened
in
her
cheeks
of
you
he
said
fervently
i
love
you
lucy
will
you
be
my
wife
she
stepped
back
her
eyes
opening
wide
her
parted
lips
tremulous
but
when
he
took
her
hand
she
did
not
shrink
back
further
and
she
did
not
attempt
to
take
the
hand
away
they
wandered
hand
in
hand
about
the
lanes
for
an
hour
while
the
horse
contentedly
nibbled
at
the
grass
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
hedge
and
during
that
hour
ralph
told
her
who
and
what
he
was
told
her
everything
indeed
excepting
his
love
for
leslie
lisle
and
lucy
was
still
in
amaze
as
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
house
you
must
come
in
if
only
for
a
moment
she
said
as
he
was
unfastening
the
reins
i
want
to
tell
her
my
to
to
to
show
you
to
her
her
eyes
sunk
and
her
voice
trembled
i
know
she
will
be
so
glad
besides
i
i
tell
her
about
it
all
by
myself
it
is
so
sudden
so
dreadfully
sudden
that
i
should
die
of
shame
and
her
face
grew
crimson
as
she
laughed
all
right
he
said
i
will
come
in
but
it
must
be
only
for
a
moment
lucy
she
opened
the
gate
and
as
she
did
so
something
glittering
on
the
path
caught
her
eye
she
stooped
and
picked
it
up
why
it
a
ring
she
exclaimed
a
gentleman
ring
you
must
have
dropped
it
as
you
came
in
ralph
not
i
he
said
shaking
his
head
he
had
not
worn
a
ring
since
since
he
had
given
his
to
leslie
but
you
must
have
done
she
said
with
charming
persistence
no
gentleman
has
passed
this
gate
excepting
you
sir
he
laughed
let
me
see
he
said
he
took
the
ring
looked
at
it
and
the
smile
fled
from
his
face
which
suddenly
went
pale
it
was
the
ring
he
had
given
leslie
he
stood
dumb
with
amazement
well
she
said
linking
her
arm
in
his
and
so
intent
on
the
ring
that
she
did
not
notice
his
pallor
and
constraint
yes
he
said
and
his
voice
rang
out
with
a
strange
doubt
and
trouble
yes
it
is
my
ring
chapter
xxxvii
poor
girl
ralph
duncombe
stood
looking
at
the
ring
as
a
man
looks
upon
some
trinket
he
has
happened
on
that
belonged
to
some
dearly
loved
friend
long
since
dead
the
ring
he
had
given
to
leslie
back
in
a
flash
came
the
memory
of
that
morning
he
had
given
it
to
her
the
sea
the
beach
the
lovely
face
floated
before
his
eyes
and
made
him
giddy
he
had
just
asked
this
sweet
innocent
girl
to
be
his
wife
he
had
no
right
no
wish
to
think
of
leslie
as
a
lover
and
yet
ah
well
in
the
heart
as
in
heaven
there
are
many
manoeuvres
and
for
the
moment
the
old
love
filled
the
biggest
place
in
ralph
duncombe
heart
what
is
the
matter
asked
lucy
with
faint
wonder
at
his
silence
and
stillness
is
it
so
very
precious
a
ring
let
me
look
at
it
would
you
have
been
very
sorry
if
you
had
lost
it
very
he
said
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
how
glad
i
am
that
i
found
it
you
must
have
dropped
it
as
you
came
in
how
careless
of
you
no
he
said
bravely
he
could
no
more
prevaricate
before
that
sweet
innocence
than
lie
outright
no
lucy
i
did
not
drop
it
just
now
i
parted
with
it
a
long
while
ago
and
i
have
not
seen
it
since
until
now
lucy
gazed
up
at
him
then
how
did
it
come
here
she
asked
in
an
awestruck
whisper
to
whom
did
you
give
it
a
gentleman
of
course
no
he
said
after
a
moment
hesitation
it
was
to
before
he
could
add
woman
a
voice
low
and
clear
a
voice
which
thrilled
him
and
awoke
the
echo
thank
god
for
lucy
sake
only
the
echo
of
his
old
passion
was
heard
in
the
doorway
lucy
are
you
there
it
was
leslie
voice
ralph
duncombe
started
and
in
the
shock
of
surprise
seized
lucy
arm
who
is
that
he
breathed
in
a
hushed
whisper
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
doorway
why
how
nervous
you
are
she
said
laughing
softly
but
a
little
timidly
for
she
had
seen
him
start
and
felt
the
pressure
of
his
hand
who
should
it
be
but
my
friend
miss
lisle
miss
lisle
he
repeated
something
in
his
voice
startled
lucy
and
she
shrank
from
him
the
slightest
bit
in
the
world
but
he
noticed
it
and
he
put
his
arm
round
her
your
your
fellow
teacher
is
called
leslie
lisle
he
said
i
did
say
said
lucy
but
it
is
leslie
as
she
spoke
a
tall
slim
figure
in
a
white
dress
appeared
against
the
dim
background
of
the
open
doorway
then
came
towards
them
then
stopped
is
that
you
lucy
you
are
not
alone
as
she
stopped
her
eyes
glanced
quickly
from
one
to
the
other
dilating
as
she
looked
then
her
face
grew
crimson
and
she
spoke
his
name
ralph
leslie
he
answered
and
made
a
movement
towards
her
then
as
if
suddenly
remembering
the
wondering
frightened
girl
on
his
arm
stopped
you
you
know
one
another
said
lucy
at
last
in
a
kind
of
gasp
oh
what
does
it
mean
ralph
duncombe
the
ever
ready
city
man
the
man
whose
clerks
regarded
him
as
of
iron
rather
than
flesh
and
blood
stood
biting
his
lip
and
staring
at
the
white
figure
motionless
and
dumb
but
the
gods
made
women
quick
and
that
glance
from
one
to
the
other
had
told
leslie
all
their
story
trembling
a
little
but
outwardly
calm
she
glided
towards
them
yes
she
said
slowly
distinctly
duncombe
and
i
know
each
other
we
are
old
very
old
friends
friends
fell
from
lucy
quivering
lips
and
spoke
doubtfully
in
her
eyes
yes
dear
said
leslie
softly
great
friends
nothing
more
the
last
two
words
were
breathed
rather
than
spoken
and
lucy
lips
opened
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
the
hand
that
had
been
gradually
slipping
slipping
from
ralph
arm
tightened
again
this
this
is
a
surprise
les
miss
lisle
he
said
at
last
and
his
voice
sounded
almost
harsh
from
his
emotion
where
have
you
been
what
has
happened
he
glanced
at
the
black
scarf
at
the
black
ribbons
on
her
sleeves
and
his
voice
faltered
leslie
head
drooped
for
a
moment
then
she
raised
it
bravely
yes
she
said
answering
his
unspoken
question
months
ago
i
will
tell
you
about
it
presently
will
you
both
go
in
you
have
something
to
tell
me
i
see
and
she
smiled
i
will
come
directly
i
have
lost
something
lucy
took
ralph
hand
and
held
it
up
it
is
found
she
said
and
pointed
to
the
ring
solemnly
it
was
to
you
he
gave
it
was
it
not
leslie
and
a
dark
a
terrible
fear
a
pang
almost
of
jealousy
shook
her
heart
leslie
motioned
to
ralph
to
be
silent
and
taking
lucy
hand
drew
her
towards
her
yes
lucy
she
said
in
a
low
voice
every
word
thrilling
intensely
the
ring
was
given
to
me
by
duncombe
it
was
given
to
me
as
a
pledge
of
friendship
it
was
a
farewell
gift
given
without
requital
a
pledge
and
a
token
that
if
ever
i
needed
the
donor
help
i
had
but
to
send
it
as
a
message
to
find
that
help
since
the
day
he
gave
it
to
me
i
have
not
seen
duncombe
but
i
have
not
forgotten
him
nor
ceased
to
cherish
my
ring
and
yet
a
sad
little
smile
curved
her
lip
i
have
lost
it
twice
somehow
these
last
few
words
went
farther
to
reassure
lucy
than
anything
else
could
go
lovers
do
not
lose
their
love
tokens
if
leslie
had
cared
for
ralph
she
would
have
taken
better
care
of
her
ring
i
i
do
understand
ah
yes
i
do
i
see
it
all
she
said
with
a
little
sob
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
i
understand
it
all
it
is
very
natural
her
voice
choked
a
little
who
could
see
you
know
you
without
loving
you
hush
hush
whispered
leslie
in
her
ear
that
was
so
long
ago
that
he
has
forgotten
it
there
is
only
one
woman
in
the
world
he
loves
and
she
is
here
and
she
drew
lucy
face
against
her
bosom
with
a
loving
pressure
ralph
duncombe
stood
as
a
man
in
such
a
situation
must
stand
silent
and
awkward
it
seemed
as
if
both
had
clean
forgotten
him
but
suddenly
leslie
held
out
her
hand
to
him
we
have
not
shaken
hands
yet
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
and
we
are
keeping
you
outside
in
the
most
inhospitable
fashion
pray
come
in
and
she
went
in
still
holding
lucy
to
her
now
let
me
turn
up
the
lamp
how
the
evenings
draw
in
do
they
not
supper
is
ready
and
then
she
broke
down
and
sinking
into
a
chair
leant
her
head
in
her
hands
lucy
knelt
beside
her
and
soothed
her
it
is
her
father
she
is
thinking
of
she
whispered
to
ralph
with
womanly
instinct
she
knew
that
leslie
would
have
died
rather
than
weep
over
a
lost
lover
before
that
lover
and
the
woman
who
had
won
him
it
is
of
her
father
the
sight
of
you
has
brought
it
all
back
to
her
oh
how
wonderful
it
all
is
to
think
that
you
i
better
go
said
ralph
with
a
man
aptitude
at
doing
the
wrong
thing
no
no
wait
till
she
has
got
over
it
she
will
be
all
right
in
a
moment
you
do
know
how
brave
she
is
indeed
almost
in
a
moment
leslie
had
dried
her
tears
forgive
me
she
murmured
penitently
how
selfish
you
must
think
me
and
i
am
so
full
of
happiness
at
her
happiness
too
and
it
was
to
this
gentleman
this
old
friend
of
mine
you
gave
the
fern
root
and
it
was
he
who
drove
you
and
jenny
home
in
the
rain
yes
is
it
like
a
fairy
story
leslie
and
you
are
really
glad
she
asked
wistfully
leslie
took
the
upturned
face
in
her
hand
gladder
than
i
have
ever
been
in
my
life
than
i
have
been
for
ah
so
long
she
corrected
herself
if
i
could
have
chosen
your
future
for
you
i
would
have
chosen
just
this
that
fate
has
planned
you
will
make
each
other
very
very
happy
i
know
now
sit
down
duncombe
i
will
promise
not
to
not
to
cry
again
lucy
cut
some
bread
i
will
be
back
in
a
moment
as
she
left
the
room
lucy
stole
half
timidly
up
to
ralph
oh
how
could
you
think
of
me
after
after
loving
her
she
whispered
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
say
no
more
lucy
he
said
gravely
let
the
past
bury
its
dead
yes
i
i
loved
her
but
she
i
was
no
more
to
her
never
could
have
been
more
to
her
than
just
a
friend
i
know
it
now
are
you
satisfied
dearest
she
looked
into
his
eyes
for
a
moment
a
look
which
seemed
to
sink
into
his
soul
then
she
let
her
head
fall
on
his
breast
with
a
sigh
of
peace
when
leslie
came
down
there
were
no
tears
in
her
eyes
and
presently
of
her
own
accord
she
spoke
of
her
father
death
and
told
ralph
duncombe
how
she
had
met
with
lucy
and
how
they
had
passed
their
exams
and
obtained
the
school
but
not
one
word
did
she
say
of
yorke
ralph
noticed
this
and
why
did
you
not
send
to
me
he
said
reproachfully
leslie
shook
her
head
you
were
too
proud
he
said
yes
that
was
it
she
admitted
quietly
i
was
too
proud
and
it
would
have
given
me
much
pleasure
to
have
helped
you
he
said
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
now
can
you
think
of
nothing
leslie
shook
her
head
with
a
faint
smile
we
have
everything
we
want
have
we
not
lucy
she
said
lucy
blushed
she
certainly
had
no
there
is
nothing
continued
leslie
then
she
stopped
and
he
looked
up
quickly
there
is
something
you
have
thought
of
he
said
leslie
head
drooped
thoughtfully
yes
there
is
something
she
said
lucy
got
up
as
if
to
leave
the
room
but
leslie
put
out
a
hand
and
stayed
her
no
dear
it
is
no
secret
besides
if
it
were
you
must
not
keep
secrets
from
each
other
wait
a
moment
lucy
and
ralph
exchanged
glances
do
you
know
anything
he
asked
lucy
shook
her
head
no
she
replied
in
an
awed
whisper
she
has
told
me
nothing
of
her
past
nothing
we
love
each
other
like
sisters
and
i
think
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
half
so
good
or
sweet
as
leslie
but
i
should
not
dare
yes
that
is
the
word
to
ask
for
her
confidence
leslie
came
back
into
the
room
she
had
a
small
packet
in
her
hand
and
she
laid
it
on
the
table
before
ralph
duncombe
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
something
for
me
she
said
with
a
smile
that
flickered
sadly
as
if
it
were
very
near
tears
i
wish
you
to
give
this
to
the
person
to
whom
it
is
addressed
ralph
duncombe
took
up
the
packet
the
duke
of
rothbury
he
said
aloud
lucy
opened
her
eyes
you
may
open
it
said
leslie
in
a
low
voice
it
is
of
value
great
value
i
believe
if
it
had
not
been
i
would
have
sent
it
by
post
yes
open
it
ralph
duncombe
opened
the
packet
and
stared
amazed
it
is
of
great
value
he
said
gravely
and
and
i
am
to
give
it
to
the
duke
of
rothbury
yes
said
leslie
her
lips
quivering
the
sight
of
the
sorrow
which
she
was
trying
to
hide
stirred
him
past
repression
he
gave
you
this
he
said
yes
but
but
do
not
ask
me
any
questions
please
she
faltered
her
color
came
and
went
it
is
not
necessary
he
said
you
have
suffered
and
at
his
hands
no
no
but
it
is
yes
yes
he
said
with
restrained
passion
and
with
a
strange
perplexity
great
heaven
what
a
mistake
lady
eleanor
had
made
it
was
not
lord
auchester
then
but
the
duke
of
rothbury
leslie
had
been
going
to
marry
i
will
give
it
him
he
said
sternly
leslie
looked
up
with
a
sudden
glance
of
apprehension
give
it
to
him
but
that
is
all
she
said
meaningly
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
or
done
you
mean
that
if
if
he
has
injured
you
you
have
forgiven
him
he
said
long
long
ago
she
breathed
you
may
say
that
if
if
there
should
be
occasion
but
no
more
he
bowed
his
head
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
he
said
your
word
is
a
law
to
me
i
knew
you
would
do
it
for
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
would
understand
then
as
if
she
wished
the
subject
to
be
closed
she
began
to
talk
of
his
and
lucy
strange
meeting
and
their
future
it
is
the
greatest
pity
in
the
world
that
you
should
have
happened
to
be
passing
the
day
lucy
was
frightened
by
the
wild
horseman
for
the
government
will
lose
one
of
its
best
teachers
and
i
shall
gain
one
of
the
best
of
wives
he
murmured
they
talked
for
half
an
hour
and
leslie
seemed
as
as
they
but
presently
she
stole
out
of
the
room
looking
over
her
shoulder
in
the
doorway
with
a
do
you
understand
it
whispered
lucy
as
he
took
her
in
his
arms
to
say
farewell
does
it
mean
that
leslie
might
have
been
a
duchess
yes
i
think
so
he
said
i
do
quite
understand
it
i
feel
as
if
i
were
groping
in
the
dark
with
just
a
glimmer
of
light
but
anyhow
i
know
i
am
sure
that
the
fault
if
there
was
any
was
his
and
i
wish
that
she
had
left
me
free
to
tell
him
so
and
exact
reparation
ah
but
that
is
just
what
you
must
not
do
said
lucy
sternly
it
is
just
what
leslie
does
not
want
you
are
to
give
him
back
the
diamonds
and
say
nothing
excepting
that
she
forgives
him
he
nodded
with
a
sigh
poor
leslie
how
she
must
have
suffered
yes
you
can
see
that
by
her
face
even
now
and
it
is
ever
so
much
happier
and
brighter
than
when
i
saw
it
first
ah
ralph
i
wish
she
were
as
happy
as
we
are
ralph
duncombe
as
he
drove
along
the
road
to
white
place
with
the
diamond
pendant
in
his
pocket
felt
like
a
man
struggling
with
a
tremendous
enigma
lady
eleanor
had
evidently
made
a
terrible
and
unaccountable
blunder
in
stating
and
believing
that
it
was
yorke
auchester
whom
leslie
was
going
to
marry
how
could
she
have
made
such
a
mistake
and
what
had
happened
to
break
off
the
marriage
had
the
duke
jilted
leslie
at
the
thought
though
he
was
in
love
with
lucy
now
his
face
grew
red
with
anger
and
he
felt
that
duke
or
no
duke
he
would
have
called
him
to
account
but
for
leslie
injunction
when
he
reached
white
place
he
found
lady
eleanor
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
and
she
turned
to
greet
him
with
a
smile
on
her
flushed
face
you
have
good
news
he
said
yes
she
nodded
twice
with
a
joyous
light
in
her
eyes
i
have
heard
from
lord
auchester
he
is
coming
back
the
day
after
he
and
the
duke
of
rothbury
ralph
started
and
his
face
darkened
the
duke
of
rothbury
he
said
i
am
glad
of
that
lady
eleanor
for
i
wish
to
see
him
and
lady
eleanor
i
have
something
to
tell
you
something
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
there
has
been
a
strange
and
awkward
mistake
it
was
not
lord
auchester
who
was
going
to
marry
miss
miss
lisle
but
the
duke
of
rothbury
lady
eleanor
face
paled
and
she
caught
her
breath
not
yorke
the
duke
ah
no
no
that
can
not
be
pardon
me
but
i
am
right
he
said
rather
sternly
she
shook
her
head
no
no
i
saw
she
stopped
and
the
color
flew
to
her
face
i
saw
him
buying
the
the
wedding
ring
ralph
stared
at
her
then
he
smiled
grimly
he
may
have
bought
a
ring
but
not
for
himself
he
said
it
may
have
been
for
the
duke
for
it
was
the
duke
she
was
going
to
marry
lady
eleanor
how
how
do
you
know
miss
lisle
herself
told
me
she
started
she
where
where
is
she
she
is
the
teacher
at
the
school
at
newfold
lady
eleanor
sank
into
a
chair
and
looked
up
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
here
so
near
oh
let
me
think
and
she
clasped
her
hands
over
her
eyes
that
is
what
i
have
been
doing
thinking
he
said
grimly
it
has
been
a
terrible
blunder
i
do
not
know
all
the
circumstances
scarcely
any
indeed
of
the
case
i
only
know
that
it
was
the
duke
to
whom
she
was
engaged
was
then
it
is
broken
off
yes
he
said
gravely
by
miss
lisle
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
i
am
certain
she
looked
at
him
keenly
you
know
her
you
have
known
her
all
along
she
saw
him
color
and
added
in
a
breath
ah
i
understand
yes
he
said
i
have
known
miss
lisle
a
long
time
i
had
hoped
once
to
induce
her
to
become
my
wife
but
and
now
i
am
engaged
to
another
lady
he
said
rather
stiffly
miss
lisle
refused
me
that
is
all
that
need
be
said
on
that
point
lady
eleanor
she
inclined
her
head
it
has
been
a
terrible
blunder
she
said
thoughtfully
but
ah
what
a
load
your
news
has
removed
from
my
heart
not
lord
auchester
but
the
duke
she
closed
her
eyes
and
drew
a
long
breath
yorke
was
all
her
own
now
can
you
tell
me
the
duke
address
lady
eleanor
he
asked
after
a
pause
his
london
house
is
in
grosvenor
square
he
will
go
there
and
not
to
rothbury
on
his
return
to
england
do
you
want
to
see
him
she
added
why
i
have
a
small
matter
of
business
with
his
grace
he
replied
lady
eleanor
looked
at
his
grave
face
apprehensively
you
will
not
tell
him
anything
that
has
occurred
scarcely
lady
eleanor
he
said
that
which
you
and
i
did
in
regard
to
these
bills
and
lord
money
affairs
must
forever
remain
secret
erase
it
from
your
memory
ah
if
i
could
she
murmured
when
i
think
of
the
possibility
of
his
knowing
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
ever
know
he
said
the
secret
is
yours
and
mine
alone
you
say
that
lord
auchester
is
returning
the
day
after
yes
in
that
case
lady
eleanor
my
visits
to
white
place
must
cease
you
will
not
need
any
help
of
mine
in
the
future
i
need
not
say
that
i
should
be
as
ready
and
willing
to
be
of
assistance
to
you
as
i
have
ever
been
but
it
will
be
better
that
all
communication
between
us
should
cease
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
no
no
i
understand
she
said
i
am
very
grateful
for
all
you
have
done
but
for
you
i
should
not
be
as
happy
as
i
am
i
am
glad
to
have
helped
you
to
that
happiness
however
slightly
he
said
and
i
trust
that
you
may
be
happier
still
in
the
future
lady
eleanor
he
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
or
two
then
left
her
he
had
no
desire
to
see
her
again
if
he
could
have
done
so
he
would
have
wiped
from
his
memory
the
plot
in
which
he
had
been
concerned
with
her
to
drive
lord
auchester
into
her
arms
indeed
as
he
drove
through
the
silent
night
he
felt
heartily
ashamed
of
it
he
thought
of
leslie
and
lucy
throughout
the
journey
with
a
strange
sense
of
confusion
he
loved
the
gentle
girl
who
had
given
him
her
heart
but
he
would
remain
friend
and
champion
that
the
duke
of
rothbury
had
in
some
way
behaved
badly
to
her
he
felt
assured
and
but
for
his
promise
to
leslie
he
would
have
called
him
to
account
as
it
was
he
had
bound
himself
to
the
simple
return
of
the
diamond
pendant
he
carried
it
in
his
breast
pocket
for
the
two
following
days
and
on
the
third
went
to
grosvenor
square
yes
sir
his
grace
is
at
home
but
i
do
not
know
whether
he
can
see
you
i
will
ask
his
gentleman
grey
came
into
the
hall
and
shook
his
head
as
ralph
duncombe
preferred
a
request
for
an
interview
his
grace
only
returned
yesterday
and
is
very
tired
sir
he
said
i
am
afraid
he
can
not
see
you
ralph
duncombe
wrote
on
the
back
of
his
card
from
miss
lisle
and
enclosed
it
in
an
envelope
give
that
to
his
grace
he
said
grey
came
back
after
a
few
minutes
his
grace
will
see
you
sir
follow
me
if
you
please
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
study
at
the
back
of
the
hall
the
duke
was
lying
on
the
adjustable
couch
and
the
sight
of
his
wasted
form
and
deathlike
face
startled
ralph
duncombe
and
drove
all
the
anger
from
his
heart
the
duke
signed
to
grey
to
withdraw
then
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
looked
at
ralph
duncombe
keenly
you
wish
to
see
me
he
said
yes
said
ralph
and
unconsciously
he
lowered
his
voice
and
you
come
from
miss
lisle
a
faint
very
faint
color
tinged
the
transparent
face
i
do
your
grace
i
am
charged
with
a
simple
mission
miss
lisle
bids
me
return
this
to
your
grace
and
he
held
out
the
packet
the
duke
took
it
and
opened
it
and
gazed
at
the
pendant
as
it
flashed
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
she
told
you
to
return
it
to
me
i
did
not
give
he
stopped
i
was
to
return
it
to
the
duke
of
rothbury
said
ralph
rather
sternly
to
the
duke
of
rothbury
yes
yes
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
and
the
color
deepened
in
his
face
you
have
come
from
miss
lisle
you
know
where
she
is
may
i
ask
her
address
i
can
not
give
it
to
your
grace
said
ralph
the
duke
flashed
his
eyes
they
glittered
in
their
dark
rings
then
he
let
them
fall
and
sighed
i
understand
at
least
you
will
tell
me
whether
she
is
well
and
and
happy
ralph
duncombe
wrath
smouldered
she
is
well
now
and
i
trust
happy
he
said
now
has
she
been
ill
ill
and
in
great
trouble
her
father
is
dead
the
duke
raised
himself
to
an
upright
position
then
sank
back
poor
girl
poor
girl
he
murmured
ralph
duncombe
flushed
miss
lisle
neither
asks
nor
would
accept
your
pity
your
grace
he
said
sternly
i
am
ignorant
of
the
events
connected
with
that
gift
or
its
return
i
do
not
wish
to
know
anything
about
it
but
of
this
i
am
assured
that
miss
lisle
desires
to
hold
no
further
communication
with
you
the
duke
was
silent
for
a
moment
very
good
he
said
at
last
i
understand
but
i
think
if
she
knew
how
much
i
desire
her
forgiveness
for
the
deceit
i
practised
upon
her
and
how
near
i
am
to
that
land
which
forgiveness
can
not
reach
she
would
not
refuse
to
forgive
me
i
have
discharged
my
mission
said
ralph
coldly
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
convey
leslie
forgiveness
the
duke
touched
an
electric
bell
i
wish
you
good
day
sir
he
said
and
sank
back
with
a
sigh
but
after
ralph
duncombe
had
gone
he
opened
his
hand
and
looked
at
the
diamond
pendant
which
still
lay
in
his
palm
yorke
had
given
her
this
he
said
musingly
but
why
did
she
send
it
to
me
why
what
shall
i
do
with
it
give
it
to
him
dare
i
do
so
just
now
will
it
be
safe
to
call
up
sleeping
memories
had
i
not
better
wait
until
until
after
the
wedding
he
decided
that
he
would
do
so
and
carefully
placing
the
pendant
in
the
drawer
of
a
cabinet
that
stood
near
his
elbow
he
sank
back
again
and
closed
his
eyes
but
his
lips
moved
long
afterwards
and
poor
girl
poor
girl
came
from
them
as
if
he
were
still
thinking
of
her
chapter
xxxviii
vengeance
is
mine
the
weeks
rolled
on
and
the
wedding
morn
of
yorke
and
eleanor
dallas
stood
but
three
days
off
it
was
to
be
a
quiet
wedding
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
lord
eustace
and
his
two
sons
but
the
heir
to
the
great
dukedom
of
rothbury
could
not
be
married
without
some
slight
fuss
and
the
society
papers
contained
interesting
little
paragraphs
concerning
the
event
the
happy
young
people
were
to
be
married
at
a
little
church
in
newfold
a
picturesque
village
near
lady
eleanor
dallas
seat
white
place
there
were
to
be
only
two
bridesmaids
cousins
of
the
bride
and
the
great
duke
of
rothbury
himself
was
to
be
the
bridegroom
best
man
provided
that
the
duke
should
be
well
enough
the
paragraphist
went
on
to
say
adding
that
as
was
well
known
the
duke
had
been
in
bad
health
of
late
after
the
ceremony
the
young
couple
were
to
start
for
the
south
of
france
and
on
their
return
it
had
been
arranged
that
they
should
go
to
rothbury
castle
the
seat
of
the
duke
who
intended
handing
over
the
management
of
the
vast
estate
to
his
heir
lady
eleanor
read
these
and
similar
paragraphs
until
she
had
got
them
by
heart
to
her
the
days
seemed
to
drag
along
with
hours
to
each
and
they
had
appeared
all
the
longer
in
consequence
of
absence
for
on
the
plea
of
having
to
make
his
preparations
and
business
for
the
duke
he
had
not
paid
many
visits
to
white
place
since
his
return
from
italy
but
though
eleanor
felt
his
absence
acutely
she
was
too
wise
to
complain
i
shall
have
him
altogether
presently
was
the
thought
that
consoled
her
all
my
own
my
own
with
no
fear
of
anything
or
anybody
coming
between
us
but
she
was
terribly
restless
and
wandered
about
the
grounds
and
from
room
to
room
bridal
array
was
littered
all
around
as
if
she
were
possessed
of
some
uneasy
spirit
if
one
could
only
send
you
into
a
mesmeric
sleep
and
wake
you
just
before
the
ceremony
my
dear
nell
it
would
be
a
delightful
arrangement
for
all
concerned
said
lady
denby
it
is
the
man
who
is
generally
supposed
to
be
the
nervous
party
in
the
business
but
i
be
bound
yorke
is
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
if
not
exactly
as
cool
as
that
much
abused
vegetable
yorke
certainly
showed
very
little
excitement
and
as
he
walked
into
the
duke
study
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
before
that
appointed
for
the
wedding
the
duke
glancing
at
him
keenly
remarked
on
his
placidity
you
take
things
easily
yorke
he
said
as
how
said
yorke
dropping
into
a
chair
and
poking
the
fire
well
you
do
look
as
flurried
as
a
nearly
married
man
is
supposed
to
look
i
am
not
flurried
he
said
why
should
i
be
and
he
looked
round
with
the
poker
in
his
hand
fleming
has
seen
about
the
clothes
the
banns
have
been
put
up
and
the
tickets
taken
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
on
my
side
i
imagine
no
i
am
not
at
all
flurried
but
you
look
tired
said
the
duke
is
everything
all
right
at
rothbury
yorke
had
just
come
from
there
yes
he
replied
listlessly
i
saw
lang
about
those
leases
and
arranged
about
the
timber
and
i
told
them
to
have
everything
ready
for
you
i
am
glad
you
are
going
to
winter
there
dolph
you
will
be
as
comfortable
now
that
the
whole
place
is
warmed
by
that
hot
water
arrangement
as
if
you
were
at
nice
and
will
have
the
satisfaction
in
addition
of
knowing
that
you
are
benefitting
the
people
around
they
complained
sadly
of
the
place
being
shut
up
so
much
well
you
can
alter
that
said
the
duke
you
like
the
place
and
can
live
there
five
or
six
months
out
of
the
year
i
believe
it
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
nicest
places
in
the
kingdom
yorke
nodded
and
leant
back
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
you
dine
here
asked
the
duke
after
a
pause
yorke
nodded
again
thanks
yes
i
take
my
dinner
in
here
with
you
if
you
do
mind
no
i
do
mind
said
the
duke
with
a
smile
of
gratitude
and
affection
lighting
up
his
wan
face
i
wish
you
were
going
to
dine
in
here
with
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
but
that
rather
selfish
it
do
be
longer
away
than
you
can
help
yorke
it
may
happen
that
eleanor
will
get
tired
of
the
continent
if
she
should
come
home
at
once
very
well
said
yorke
i
am
in
her
hands
of
course
of
course
and
you
could
be
in
better
or
sweeter
no
assented
yorke
absently
did
you
send
back
that
draft
of
the
leases
i
posted
to
you
eh
the
duke
thought
a
moment
no
i
did
i
forgot
all
about
them
yorke
smiled
you
see
that
it
is
time
i
handed
in
my
checks
and
allowed
a
better
man
to
take
the
berth
said
the
duke
cheerfully
i
very
sorry
especially
as
you
have
taken
so
much
trouble
about
the
business
let
me
see
where
did
i
put
them
i
ashamed
to
say
i
forgotten
look
in
that
bureau
drawer
will
you
yorke
got
up
and
sauntered
across
the
room
he
looked
very
tall
and
thin
in
his
dark
mourning
suit
of
black
serge
and
the
duke
noticed
that
he
was
paler
than
when
he
had
seen
him
last
paler
and
more
tired
looking
never
mind
he
said
let
the
lawyers
make
out
fresh
ones
oh
i
find
said
yorke
you
have
stuffed
them
in
somewhere
and
he
opened
drawer
after
drawer
in
the
free
and
easy
manner
in
which
a
favorite
son
opens
the
drawers
and
cupboards
of
a
father
i
back
you
for
carefully
mislaying
things
especially
papers
against
any
man
in
england
excepting
myself
grey
always
sees
to
them
he
has
spoilt
me
remarked
the
duke
apologetically
that
what
i
tell
my
man
fleming
said
yorke
i
should
mislay
my
head
if
he
did
put
it
on
straight
every
morning
when
he
brushed
my
hair
the
duke
laughed
they
are
a
pattern
pair
he
said
do
trouble
ring
for
grey
but
yorke
in
an
absent
mechanical
fashion
still
sauntered
round
the
room
searching
for
the
missing
drafts
and
presently
he
opened
the
drawer
of
the
small
cabinet
which
generally
stood
beside
the
couch
but
which
this
evening
was
immediately
behind
him
yorke
opened
the
drawer
and
turned
over
the
things
and
was
closing
it
again
when
his
eyes
caught
the
glitter
of
diamonds
you
keep
a
choice
collection
of
things
in
these
drawers
of
yours
dolph
he
said
what
is
it
asked
the
duke
yorke
pulled
out
the
pendant
only
diamonds
he
said
and
very
handsome
ones
too
where
on
earth
did
you
get
them
and
who
are
they
for
perhaps
i
better
not
go
poking
about
any
longer
or
i
shall
come
upon
some
secret
he
stopped
suddenly
he
had
been
speaking
in
a
tone
of
lazy
badinage
scarcely
heeding
what
he
was
saying
until
suddenly
he
recognized
the
pendant
oh
i
no
secrets
said
the
duke
what
is
it
you
have
found
ah
he
had
swung
himself
round
by
the
lever
and
saw
yorke
gazing
at
the
pendant
lying
in
his
hand
where
did
you
get
this
demanded
yorke
the
duke
looked
at
his
face
as
he
asked
the
question
it
was
grave
with
curiosity
and
surprise
but
the
duke
was
glad
to
see
that
it
showed
no
keener
emotion
and
told
himself
that
yorke
was
forgetting
leslie
do
you
recognize
it
he
asked
yes
said
yorke
slowly
it
is
a
thing
i
gave
he
stopped
how
did
it
come
here
where
did
you
get
it
it
was
brought
to
me
said
the
duke
in
a
low
voice
brought
to
you
why
to
you
yorke
demanded
looking
up
from
the
pendant
what
memories
it
awakened
i
can
not
tell
you
who
brought
it
a
man
by
the
name
of
i
forget
his
card
is
in
the
drawer
yorke
looked
no
it
is
not
here
then
it
is
lost
his
name
his
name
yes
i
remember
it
was
duncombe
ralph
duncombe
ralph
duncombe
yorke
spoke
the
name
two
or
three
times
he
seemed
to
think
that
he
had
heard
it
before
but
he
could
not
recall
it
he
put
the
pendant
in
his
pocket
and
went
and
stood
before
the
fire
with
his
back
to
the
duke
did
he
give
no
message
no
explanation
he
asked
no
said
the
duke
he
acted
as
if
he
thought
i
had
sent
the
thing
to
her
yorke
did
not
look
round
why
had
finetta
sent
back
the
pendant
and
why
had
she
sent
it
to
the
duke
instead
of
to
him
yorke
you
do
want
to
talk
about
it
said
the
duke
after
a
pause
no
i
do
assented
yorke
grimly
there
are
some
things
one
would
prefer
to
forget
ah
if
one
could
if
one
could
muttered
the
duke
the
dinner
came
in
soon
afterwards
and
the
two
men
talked
of
the
approaching
marriage
of
the
plans
for
the
winter
of
the
game
at
rothbury
of
everything
but
the
diamond
pendant
then
suddenly
yorke
who
had
been
answering
in
an
kind
of
way
uttered
an
exclamation
what
is
the
matter
demanded
the
duke
nothing
said
yorke
sharply
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
do
you
mind
my
leaving
you
before
the
coffee
not
a
bit
where
are
you
going
yorke
made
no
reply
perhaps
he
did
not
hear
he
got
up
and
rang
for
grey
to
bring
his
hat
i
shall
not
be
back
till
late
dolph
he
said
do
sit
up
he
had
remembered
suddenly
where
he
had
seen
this
ralph
name
it
was
the
man
who
had
hunted
him
down
to
the
ruin
from
which
eleanor
had
saved
him
and
it
was
by
this
man
finetta
had
sent
back
the
diamond
pendant
there
was
only
one
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
the
coincidence
it
was
finetta
then
who
had
sought
to
revenge
herself
for
his
desertion
of
her
by
planning
his
ruin
and
disgrace
it
was
she
who
had
brought
about
this
marriage
of
his
this
marriage
which
would
enslave
him
for
life
yorke
was
not
a
man
nor
a
malignant
but
at
that
moment
he
was
possessed
of
a
burning
desire
to
confront
finetta
and
charge
her
with
her
perfidy
he
went
down
the
strand
and
entered
the
diadem
the
looked
at
him
with
lively
surprise
and
interest
glad
to
see
you
back
my
lord
he
said
with
profound
respect
yorke
took
the
programme
and
glanced
at
it
miss
finetta
appears
he
asked
oh
yes
my
lord
she
will
be
on
in
a
few
minutes
yorke
sat
bolt
upright
in
his
stall
glaring
at
the
stage
there
were
several
persons
in
the
front
of
the
house
who
knew
him
but
he
looked
neither
to
the
left
nor
the
right
his
heart
was
on
fire
the
woman
she
had
pretended
to
bid
him
farewell
in
peace
and
friendship
and
had
betrayed
him
yes
he
would
wait
until
the
performance
was
over
and
would
go
round
and
confront
her
there
should
be
no
scene
but
he
would
tell
her
that
her
baseness
was
known
and
if
possible
shame
her
it
was
a
foolish
resolve
but
alas
yorke
was
never
celebrated
for
wisdom
the
orchestra
played
the
opening
to
the
second
act
the
usual
chorus
sang
and
the
usual
comic
man
cracked
the
wheezes
and
then
the
band
played
a
few
bars
of
an
evidently
well
known
melody
for
the
gallery
greeted
the
music
with
an
anticipatory
cheer
and
a
moment
afterwards
finetta
bounded
on
the
stage
there
was
a
roar
of
delighted
welcome
and
amidst
it
she
came
sailing
and
smiling
gracefully
down
to
the
footlights
her
dark
eyes
flashing
round
with
a
gleam
in
them
of
which
the
public
was
so
fond
then
suddenly
she
saw
the
well
known
face
there
in
the
stalls
for
a
second
she
paused
in
her
slow
waltzing
step
and
looked
at
him
with
a
look
that
he
might
well
take
for
fear
the
conductor
of
the
band
glanced
up
surprised
it
was
the
first
time
finetta
had
ever
missed
a
step
but
before
he
could
pull
the
band
together
and
catch
up
the
lost
bar
she
had
gone
on
dancing
and
danced
with
her
accustomed
grace
and
precision
yorke
watched
her
with
a
grim
fury
this
smiling
dancing
jade
had
plotted
to
ruin
him
had
tried
to
drive
him
into
a
court
worse
had
forced
him
to
marry
eleanor
dallas
he
could
have
sprung
up
there
and
then
and
accused
her
of
her
vileness
and
the
desire
to
do
so
was
so
great
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
rising
to
leave
the
theater
and
await
her
at
the
stage
door
when
suddenly
he
saw
her
falter
and
stumble
and
the
next
instant
the
same
instant
she
had
disappeared
and
in
the
spot
where
she
had
just
stood
was
a
gaping
hole
the
house
rose
with
a
gasp
a
sigh
of
horror
that
rose
to
a
yell
of
indignation
and
accusation
it
was
the
old
story
had
blundered
and
left
the
trap
door
unbolted
and
london
favorite
dancer
had
danced
upon
it
and
gone
down
to
the
depths
beneath
the
audience
rose
yelling
shouting
pushing
this
way
and
that
the
curtain
was
lowered
the
lights
turned
up
and
the
manager
in
the
inevitable
evening
dress
appeared
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
he
assured
the
audience
that
miss
finetta
was
not
hurt
not
seriously
hurt
and
that
though
it
would
not
be
wise
for
her
to
dance
again
that
evening
he
trusted
that
she
would
appear
again
night
etc
yorke
waited
till
the
plausible
excuse
was
concluded
then
he
quietly
in
a
dream
as
it
were
went
out
and
round
to
the
stage
door
and
one
line
of
the
book
he
had
alas
read
too
seldom
rang
in
his
ears
as
he
went
vengeance
is
mine
the
stage
door
keeper
knew
him
in
a
moment
but
in
answer
to
inquiry
if
he
could
see
miss
finetta
shook
his
head
i
do
know
sir
there
a
rumor
that
she
kil
yorke
pushed
by
him
and
made
his
way
to
the
dressing
rooms
there
was
a
crowd
of
chorus
girls
and
supers
surging
to
and
fro
in
the
corridor
and
clustered
together
in
little
knots
all
talking
in
hurried
whispers
they
made
way
for
yorke
and
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
dressing
room
the
manager
opened
it
is
it
the
doctor
oh
it
you
my
lord
he
said
in
a
whisper
an
awful
thing
in
the
middle
of
the
season
too
is
she
began
yorke
in
a
low
voice
hoarse
with
agitation
but
low
as
it
was
it
was
heard
by
someone
within
the
room
for
finetta
voice
weak
and
hollow
with
pain
said
is
that
you
yorke
let
him
come
in
chapter
xxxix
finetta
confession
yorke
went
in
finetta
was
lying
on
the
sofa
lying
with
that
awful
inert
look
which
tells
its
own
story
her
shapely
arm
hung
down
limply
helplessly
across
her
face
white
as
death
a
thin
line
of
blood
trickled
coming
again
as
fast
as
the
trembling
dresser
wiped
it
away
one
or
two
women
stood
near
her
silent
and
apprehensive
she
lifted
her
eyes
heavily
and
tried
to
smile
i
i
thought
you
would
come
she
said
painfully
i
saw
you
in
the
stalls
yorke
bent
over
her
all
the
anger
sped
from
his
heart
are
you
hurt
fin
he
said
in
a
low
voice
yes
she
said
badly
i
think
some
some
fool
left
the
trap
unbolted
or
a
gleam
of
fire
shot
into
her
eyes
for
a
moment
or
was
it
done
on
purpose
eh
there
one
or
two
here
who
would
be
sorry
to
have
me
out
of
the
bills

they
have
their
wish
for
a
short
time
have
you
sent
for
a
doctor

asked
the
manager
he
nodded

finetta
sharply

outside

lord

be
moved

yorke
finetta
voice
came
to
them
take
me
home
a
long
slight
table
stood
in
the
passage
yorke
wrenched
the
legs
off
and
called
to
a
couple
of
carpenters
then
with
the
help
of
the
manager
and
dresser
he
laid
finetta
on
this
impromptu
stretcher
and
carried
her
to
the
brougham
which
was
waiting
outside
drive
slowly
he
said
to
the
man
no

him

fast
panted
finetta

can
bear
it
and
she
clenched
her
teeth
yorke
sat
beside
her
and
supported
her
and
she
lay
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
her
teeth
set
hard
her
hands
grasping
each
other
and
no
cry
or
groan
passed
her
lips
at
the
sound
of
the
brougham
wheels
polly
came
to
the
door
and
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
at
the
sight
of
her
sister
lying
limp
and
helpless
in
yorke
arms
oh
lord
yorke
she
gasped
do
be
frightened
polly
he
said
finetta
has
met
with
an
accident
they
carried
her
upstairs

her
undressed
and
into
bed
he
said
i
going
for
a
doctor

yorke
finetta
managed
to
say
of
course
he
said
keep
up
your
heart
fin
you
be
all
right
he
got
the
doctor
and
while
he
was
upstairs
making
his
examination
yorke
paced
up
and
down
the
sumptuous
in
which
he
had
spent
so
many
pleasant
merry
hours
it
seemed
an
age
before
the
doctor
came
down
well
asked
yorke
anxiously
the
doctor
looked
down
with
the
professional
gravity
she
is
very
badly
hurt
he
said
oh
no
he
added
seeing
yorke
start
and
wince
i
do
say
that
it
will
kill
her
but
you
see
she
struck
the
edge
of
the
trap
with
her
back
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
sir
andrew
yes
yes
said
yorke
i
will
send
for
him
at
once
oh
will
do
my
lord
said
the
doctor
he
could
do
no
more
for
her
than
i
can
accomplish
and
she
is
unfortunately
in
very
little
pain
but
there
seems
to
be
something
on
her
mind
something
in
which
your
lordship
is
concerned
and
she
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
i
will
go
to
her
said
yorke
at
once
they
went
upstairs
and
finetta
turned
her
great
eyes
upon
them
what
has
he
been
telling
you
yorke
she
asked
feebly
am
i
going
to
die
do
be
afraid
i
not
a
milksop
and
i
sha
go
into
hysterics
and
make
a
scene
i
suppose
i
got
to
die
as
well
as
other
people
no
no
there
is
no
talk
of
dying
fin
he
said
then
what
is
it
why
do
you
both
look
so
glum
she
said
impatiently
there
nothing
much
in
falling
down
a
trap
i
seen
heaps
of
people
do
it
what
is
it
am
i
going
to
be
laid
up
long
ask
him
how
soon
i
shall
be
able
to
dance
again
better
be
quiet
said
the
doctor
with
his
hand
on
her
pulse
you
answer
my
question
she
retorted
as
furiously
as
her
weakness
would
allow
i
answer
any
questions
you
like
he
said
soothingly
i
want
you
to
rest
now
they
all
like
that
a
pack
of
old
women
she
said
and
they
think
we
all
old
women
too
rest
ah
if
he
could
give
me
something
that
would
make
me
rest
do
go
yorke
not
yet
i
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
it
a
long
time
since
you
were
here
yorke
and
she
sighed
he
sat
down
beside
the
bed
and
held
her
hand
and
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
gratefully
then
averted
them
and
groaned
faintly
did
i
hurt
you
fin
he
asked
no
no
she
replied
it
was
that
it
it
was
something
i
was
thinking
of
you
must
talk
said
the
doctor
she
opened
her
lips
and
grinned
at
him
contemptuously
why
must
i
do
you
think
i
am
going
off
my
head
well
there
but
do
leave
me
or
if
you
do
come
again
yorke
and
she
turned
her
head
away
and
closed
her
eyes
yorke
sat
beside
her
through
the
night
holding
her
hand
at
times
she
seemed
to
fall
into
an
uneasy
slumber
from
which
she
would
wake
and
look
from
him
to
polly
with
a
vacant
gaze
which
grew
troubled
when
it
rested
on
his
face
and
then
she
would
sigh
and
close
her
eyes
again
toward
morning
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
yorke
went
home
but
only
remained
long
enough
to
change
his
clothes
and
returned
to
john
wood
he
found
sir
andrew
there
and
the
great
man
greeted
him
with
a
significant
gravity
but
before
he
could
speak
finetta
turned
her
eyes
to
yorke
ask
him
to
tell
me
the
truth
of
the
case
yorke
she
said
in
a
voice
much
weaker
than
that
of
last
night
i
not
afraid
he
says
i
not
going
to
die
but
ask
him
how
soon
i
shall
get
back
to
the
diadem
sir
andrew
smiled
but
it
was
the
smile
which
masks
the
face
of
the
physician
while
he
pronounces
sentence
not
yet
awhile
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
not
yet
ah
she
tried
to
sit
up
but
sank
back
and
fixed
her
dark
bold
eyes
on
him
you
mean
what
is
it
you
mean
not
not
her
voice
quivered
and
broke
oh
god
you
mean
that
i
shall
never
dance
again
the
doctor
looked
down
she
read
his
answer
in
his
face
and
silenced
sir
andrew
conventional
protest
you
you
need
lie
i
i
can
see
it
in
your
faces
oh
and
a
low
but
cry
rose
from
her
white
lips
oh
never
never
again
never
to
dance
again
oh
yorke
yorke
tell
them
to
kill
me
i
rather
die
rather
ten
thousand
times
rather
never
to
dance
again
it
is
true
she
burst
out
her
tone
changed
to
weak
fury
and
resentment
you
do
know
you
ca
tell
doctors
are
fools
all
of
send
them
away
yorke
i
hate
the
sight
of
them
standing
there
like
a
couple
of
undertakers
what
not
to
dance
again
it
a
lie
it
a
then
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
her
whole
body
shook
and
trembled
the
paroxysms
passed
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
put
out
her
hand
to
yorke
it
true
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
i
feel
it
do
do
mind
what
i
said
gentlemen
it
it
knocked
me
rather
hard
you
see
got
nothing
to
to
live
for
but
my
dancing
i
i
nothing
without
that
oh
god
what
an
end
to
lie
here
she
turned
her
head
away
and
groaned
yorke
held
her
hand
in
silence
what
could
he
say
the
doctors
went
the
morning
passed
he
sat
and
held
finetta
hand
as
she
dozed
heavily
every
now
and
then
she
stirred
and
opened
her
eyes
saw
and
recognized
him
and
with
a
sigh
closed
them
again
as
if
his
presence
soothed
and
comforted
her
he
left
her
in
the
middle
of
the
day
promising
to
return
in
a
few
hours
he
was
to
be
married
in
two
days
time
and
there
were
things
to
be
done
and
settled
he
found
a
letter
from
lady
eleanor
awaiting
him
a
loving
passionate
letter
reminding
him
of
some
trifle
in
connection
with
their
wedding
trip
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
scarcely
read
and
in
the
afternoon
returned
to
finetta
her
eyes
turned
to
the
door
with
painful
feverish
eagerness
as
he
entered
and
she
smiled
gratefully
and
yet
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
a
curious
mixture
of
fear
and
sadness
you
you
are
very
good
to
me
yorke
she
said
better
better
than
i
deserve
all
right
fin
he
said
pressing
her
hand
you
do
the
same
for
me
old
friends
you
know
yes
she
said
old
friends
she
was
silent
a
moment
or
two
then
with
an
effort
she
said
yorke
i
got
something
to
tell
you
and
and
i
think
i
rather
die
than
say
it
do
say
it
then
he
said
promptly
what
it
matter
you
got
to
keep
quiet
the
doctor
said
but
i
got
to
say
it
she
broke
in
with
a
moan
i
ca
sleep
or
rest
while
it
on
my
mind
you
ca
guess
what
it
is
yorke
no
never
mind
let
it
slide
till
you
get
better
fin
she
shook
her
head
as
well
as
she
could
that
would
be
a
long
time
to
keep
it
she
said
yorke
what
brought
you
to
the
theater
last
night
he
started
slightly
it
might
almost
be
said
that
he
had
forgotten
the
diamond
pendant
which
was
still
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
why
i
came
to
see
you
of
course
he
replied
yes
she
said
her
large
eyes
fixed
on
his
yes
but
why
i
saw
your
face
yorke
and
there
was
mischief
in
it
i
saw
that
you
had
found
out
something
if
not
all
found
out
what
he
asked
carelessly
oh
you
mean
about
the
pendant
what
made
you
send
it
back
fin
she
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
frown
what
pendant

are
you
talking
about
the
diamond
ornament
you
sent
back
he
said
but
there
worry
diamonds
i
sent
back
is
that
likely
but
what
diamonds
you
never
gave
me
any
he
tried
to
smile
banteringly
he
thought
her
mind
was
wandering
never
mind
there
he
took
the
pendant
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
in
her
hand
take
it
back
again
and
keep
it
this
time
she
looked
at
it
and
from
it
to
him
i
never
sent
this
to
you
i
never
saw
it
before
she
said
all
right
it
does
matter
never
you
say
you
gave
it
to
me
when
when
i
sent
it
to
you
the
night
the
day
after
we
parted
he
said
her
eyes
dilated
and
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
you
sent
this
this
to
me
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind
or
i
am
and
you
say
i
sent
it
back
look
here

he
said
soothingly
i
know
what
it
is
you
want
to
say
to
me
and
i
want
to
save
you
the
trouble
and
worry
of
saying
it
so
i
will
tell
you
that
i
know
all
and
that
i
forgive
you
if
what
you
want
her
face
twitched
and
her
eyes
fell
from
his
you
know
all
she
faltered
he
nodded
gravely
yes
and
i
own
up
that
i
was
mad
i
came
to
the
theater
last
night
to
have
a
row
with
you
but
that
all
past
clean
past
and
after
all
you
did
do
me
any
damage
fin
not
the
damage
you
meant
to
he
corrected
himself
as
the
thought
of
his
coming
marriage
flashed
across
him
it
would
have
been
all
up
a
tree
with
me
if
a
a
friend
found
the
money
at
the
last
moment
but
as
it
turned
out
we
got
the
best
of
you
and
your
friend
ralph
duncombe
she
gazed
at
him
with
knitted
brows
ralph
who
i
never
heard
the
name
before
what
are

talking
about

demanded
never

are
driving
at
or

bit
his
lip

said
wearily

tell
you

ready
to
forget
it
that

all
it

tit
for
tat
and
only

way

of
it
yourself
fin
or
did
this
strange
gentleman
this
new
friend
of
yours
hit
upon
the
idea
of
buying
up
my
debts
and
hunting
me
into
a
corner
he
stopped
for
with
a
tremendous
effort
she
had
raised

tears
running
down
it
as

was
when

he
said
a
vague
presentiment
mingling
with
his
amazement
and
confusion
the
young
lady
leslie

she
gasped
he
sprang
to
his
feet
then
sank
into
the
chair
again
and
sat
breathing
hard
for
a
moment

waited
till
she
had
regained
strength
then
hurried
on

cliff
and
when

fainted
she
found
the
locket
with
your
portrait
in

cry

oh

same
day
as

gazed
at
him
perplexedly
for
a
moment
then
she
laughed
a
mirthless
laugh
my
god
she
said
i
see
you
put
them
in
the
wrong
papers
and
i
thought
you
you
cared
for
me

and
and
i
told
her
so
and
she
believed
it

told
her

believed

and
gave
you
up

do
otherwise
after
finding
that
locket
and
and
the
lies
i
told
her
i
said
you
were
going
to
marry
me
she
stopped
and
looked
at
his
face
white
and
set
you
you
could
kill
me
even
as
i
lie
here
yorke
she
said
in
a
dull
despairing
voice
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
he
turned
his
eyes
away
go
go
on
he
said
almost
inarticulately
she
put
her
hand
to
her
brow
i
left
her
there
looking
more
dead
than
alive
and
came
back
to
town
and
i
thought
you
come
back
to
me
i
i
waited
and
one
day
i
saw
you
in
hancock
buying
the
the
ring
and
i
knew
she
taken
you
back
and
all
in
the
moment
i
i
told
her
and
then
i
got
frightened
at
what
done
and
when
i
saw
that
she
had
managed
to
do
what
i
had
failed
over
and
had
separated
you
from
leslie
lisle
and
got
you
for
herself
he
rose
and
stretched
out
his
hands
to
her
as
if
he
would
stop
her
her
who
who
she
opened
her
eyes
upon
him
why
lady
eleanor
dallas
she
you
are
going
to
marry
is
it
he
went
to
the
mantel
shelf
and
dropped
his
head
upon
his
arms
then
he
came
back
and
sank
into
the
chair
again
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
his
head
upon
his
breast
it
it
a
bad
business
yorke
she
panted
wearily
but
but
be
too
hard
on
me
or
on
her
for
she
loves
you
yorke
ah
that
been
the
trouble
all
round
we
all
loved
you
too
well
and
she
turned
her
face
away
and
closed
her
eyes
he
sat
and
stared
before
him
like
a
man
dazed
for
one
moment
he
had
felt
convinced
that
finetta
disclosure
was
the
outcome
of
delirium
but
as
she
had
gone
on
with
her
confession
he
knew
that
she
was
speaking
of
realities
they
had
misjudged
leslie
after
all
she
had
not
left
him
because
she
had
discovered
that
he
was
not
a
duke
the
reflection
was
the
only
one
relieving
streak
of
light
in
the
gloom
what
should
he
do
what
could
he
do
where
was
leslie
and
even
if
he
found
her
how
could
he
desert
lady
eleanor
how
could
he
throw
her
over
on
the
very
eve
of
their
wedding
day
she
had
not
sinned
against
him
as
finetta
had
done
her
only
sin
as
finetta
had
so
truly
said
consisted
in
loving
him
too
well
no
even
if
he
knew
where
leslie
lisle
was
he
could
not
desert
eleanor
he
must
marry
her
and
try
as
he
had
been
trying
all
this
time
to
tear
leslie
image
from
his
heart
but
ah
how
much
harder
this
feat
had
become
since
finetta
disclosure
she
looked
round
at
last
you
are
still
here
yorke
she
said
you
have
gone
i
thought
i
thought
you
have
left
me
directly
and
that
i
should
have
seen
you
again
he
laughed
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
not
much
use
in
that
fin
he
said
drearily
hopelessly
you
acted
like
well
like
a
woman
i
suppose
oh
she
moaned
i
acted
like
a
demon
i
had
any
pity
any
mercy
i
watched
her
getting
whiter
and
whiter
i
heard
her
cry
out
as
if
stabbed
her
he
put
up
his
hand
to
silence
her
that
that
will
do
fin
he
said
hoarsely
but
i
should
have
given
in
to
her
and
kept
back
the
lies
if
you
sent
me
this
she
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
and
drew
out
the
locket
that
gave
me
the
pluck
and
the
obstinacy
i
thought
after
all
you
cared
for
me
she
stopped
it
was
a
mistake
all
round
and
and
so
i
do
care
to
keep
it
any
longer
take
it
yorke
he
shook
his
head
but
she
put
the
locket
in
his
hand
do
you
think
i
keep
it
now
i
know
you
did
mean
it
for
me
but
for
her
not
me
take
it
and
well
give
me
the
other
he
suffered
her
to
close
his
hand
over
the
locket
and
she
took
the
pendant
and
laid
it
on
the
pillow
i
know
now
why
she
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
once
or
twice
this
was
lying
there
poor
girl
yes
i
can
be
sorry
for
her
for
i
knew
what
she
felt
but
it
too
late
now
yorke
i
suppose
you
got
to
marry
lady
eleanor
eh
well
as
he
remained
silent
let
hope
that
poor
young
thing
has
forgotten
you
yorke
got
up
and
strode
up
and
down
biting
his
lip
and
shutting
and
opening
his
hands
better
go
now
yorke
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
know
you
hate
the
sight
of
me
that
only
natural
no
no
fin
he
said
with
a
frown
i
not
so
bad
as
that
but
i
feel
confused
and
half
mad
god
forgive
us
all
we
all
seem
to
have
conspired
to
work
her
harm
even
dolph
and
i
who
loved
her
yes
better
go
fin
but
i
will
come
back
no
you
wo
she
said
quietly
at
least
not
till
after
your
marriage
but
yorke
well
he
asked
if
if
you
should
ever
find
her
miss
lisle
she
said
in
a
low
hesitating
voice
i
wish
i
wish
you
tell
her
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
and
ask
her
to
come
and
see
me
she
come
one
of
that
sort
of
women
that
are
always
ready
to
forgive
and
forgive
me
right
enough
when
she
sees
me
lying
here
helpless
as
a
log
and
remembers
how
hard
i
fought
beside
her
up
that
beastly
cliff
that
day
go
now
yorke
and
well
i
do
know
that
god
would
bless
you
any
the
sooner
for
my
asking
him
but
you
have
been
very
easy
with
me
yorke
after
all
i
done
to
make
you
wretched
her
voice
died
away
inaudibly
at
the
last
words
and
she
took
the
hand
he
gave
her
and
laid
it
on
her
lips
yorke
went
out
with
the
locket
in
his
hand
and
a
burning
fire
in
his
heart
and
brain
this
butterfly
o
the
wind
this
dancing
girl
had
wrecked
leslie
and
his
lives
wrecked
and
ruined
them
irreparably
she
had
spoken
of
his
finding
leslie
but
where
could
he
look
for
her
and
indeed
would
it
not
be
better
that
they
should
never
meet
again
he
had
got
to
marry
eleanor
and
the
day
after
finetta
confession
like
most
confessions
by
the
way
had
come
too
late
in
a
frame
of
mind
which
beggars
description
he
went
to
bury
street
and
resumed
his
packing
then
in
the
midst
of
it
he
remembered
that
he
had
promised
to
go
to
white
place
that
evening
this
butterfly
o
the
wind
this
dancing
girl
had
wrecked
his
life
as
he
thought
of
this
he
found
the
locket
in
his
pocket
and
transferred
it
to
that
of
the
waistcoat
he
was
putting
on
chapter
xl
my
sweet
girl
love
when
he
got
down
to
white
place
he
had
walked
from
the
station
he
found
lady
denby
alone
eleanor
has
gone
out
she
said
but
only
for
a
stroll
as
you
did
not
come
by
the
usual
train
she
gave
you
up
why
did
you
wire
i
forgot
it
he
replied
absently
lady
denby
laughed
ironically
what
is
the
use
of
having
a
special
wire
if
you
do
use
it
she
said
have
you
had
your
dinner
oh
yes
he
replied
though
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
lady
denby
looked
at
him
curiously
you
are
not
looking
very
well
yorke
she
said
you
seem
tired
and
fagged
and
a
change
is
what
you
want
well
i
shall
get
it
directly
he
said
with
unconscious
grimness
which
way
has
eleanor
gone
i
see
if
i
can
find
her
she
said
something
about
going
to
the
village
lady
denby
replied
but
i
do
expect
she
will
get
beyond
the
grounds
have
some
coffee
or
something
he
mixed
a
brandy
and
soda
more
to
please
her
than
himself
and
then
went
out
remembering
what
lady
denby
had
said
he
should
have
kept
to
the
park
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
lady
eleanor
or
the
way
she
had
taken
and
he
went
straight
out
of
the
gate
and
along
the
road
to
the
village
he
was
thinking
alas
not
of
the
woman
he
was
going
to
marry
in
two
days
time
but
of
leslie
lisle
thinking
that
perhaps
some
day
he
should
meet
her
what
would
he
say
to
her
then
would
it
be
just
simply
how
do
you
do
miss
lisle
and
go
on
his
way
again
ah
no
let
him
meet
her
when
he
might
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
tell
her
how
they
had
been
separated
and
why
when
the
knowledge
of
perfidy
had
come
to
him
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
to
her
he
would
have
to
tell
her
that
would
have
to
clear
himself
in
her
eyes
he
walked
on
wrapt
in
bitter
thoughts
haunted
by
the
spectre
which
takes
the
shape
of
might
have
been
and
found
himself
far
on
the
london
road
he
had
all
unconsciously
passed
the
village
and
he
would
have
still
kept
striding
along
but
that
a
heavy
shower
which
had
been
threatening
for
some
time
came
pelting
down
so
he
turned
back
at
a
slower
pace
and
as
most
men
do
when
they
are
getting
wet
thought
of
a
pipe
he
found
his
pipe
and
a
tobacco
pouch
but
his
match
box
was
absent
he
hunted
in
the
corners
and
crevices
of
his
pockets
for
a
match
but
unsuccessfully
and
he
was
about
to
give
up
the
idea
of
a
smoke
when
he
came
upon
the
school
and
he
stopped
and
looked
at
it
absently
he
had
been
so
absorbed
in
gloomy
reverie
as
he
passed
it
on
his
way
from
white
place
that
he
had
not
noticed
it
he
stood
by
the
little
white
gate
in
the
hedge
for
a
moment
or
two
to
see
if
any
one
was
about
of
whom
he
could
ask
a
light
then
as
no
one
appeared
he
pushed
open
the
gate
walked
up
the
narrow
weedless
path
and
knocked
at
the
door
a
neat
a
remarkably
neat
little
handmaid
answered
the
knock
and
in
severe
accents
said
round
to
the
my
man
yorke
had
his
coat
collar
turned
up
and
his
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
the
little
maid
had
taken
him
for
a
tramp
or
a
pedlar
he
smiled
and
entering
into
the
humor
of
the
thing
obediently
not
to
say
humbly
went
round
the
house
and
presented
himself
at
the
well
what
is
it
asked
the
girl
oh
i
only
want
a
light
for
my
pipe
said
yorke
will
you
be
good
enough
to
give
me
one
she
saw
her
mistake
in
a
moment
and
grew
crimson
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
we
have
so
many
tra
er
so
many
strange
kind
of
people
come
knocking
then
you
do
well
to
be
careful
he
said
she
ran
and
brought
him
a
box
of
matches
and
he
lit
his
pipe
and
thanked
her
raising
his
hat
and
was
turning
to
go
out
of
the
garden
when
she
said
would
you
like
to
wait
till
the
heaviest
of
the
rain
is
over
sir
yorke
would
have
declined
but
that
he
was
afraid
she
might
think
he
was
wounded
by
her
mistaking
him
for
a
tramp
so
he
said
thank
you
i
stand
up
under
the
hedge
for
a
minute
or
two
and
he
stood
under
a
couple
of
the
limes
that
bordered
the
side
of
the
garden
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
it
did
occur
to
him
to
wonder
whether
lady
eleanor
had
got
back
to
white
place
before
the
storm
broke
and
whether
she
in
her
turn
would
wonder
where
he
was
but
he
was
just
in
that
frame
of
mind
in
which
a
man
is
glad
to
stand
still
and
smoke
and
think
and
keep
as
far
away
as
possible
from
friends
and
acquaintances
besides
after
the
next
two
days
he
might
find
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
smoke
a
pipe
in
solitude
so
he
leant
against
the
trunk
of
the
lime
and
went
over
in
his
mind
all
the
details
of
confession
he
saw
it
all
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
been
present
at
the
scene
between
her
and
leslie
he
understood
how
quick
leslie
would
be
to
surrender
him
to
the
woman
who
had
as
she
thought
a
prior
right
how
greatly
leslie
maiden
pride
and
jealousy
would
aid
finetta
in
her
task
and
as
he
thought
his
soul
rose
in
bitter
protest
against
the
fate
which
had
wrecked
both
their
lives
he
finished
his
pipe
and
was
refilling
it
and
had
his
hand
upon
the
tobacco
pouch
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
voice
singing
he
paid
no
attention
for
a
moment
then
his
hands
grew
motionless
and
he
clutched
the
pouch
tightly
and
he
looked
up
with
a
sudden
flush
a
sudden
light
flashing
in
his
eyes
for
the
voice
was
singing
this
song
my
sweet
girl
love
with
frank
blue
eyes
though
years
have
passed
i
see
you
still
there
where
you
stand
beside
the
mill
beneath
the
bright
autumnal
skies
then
he
laughed
laughed
with
a
bitter
i
going
out
of
my
mind
he
said
with
intense
some
girl
singing
a
silly
ballad
which
no
doubt
sells
by
the
thousand
and
i
actually
trying
to
persuade
myself
that
the
voice
is
like
leslie
just
because
i
once
heard
her
singing
it
yes
i
going
mad
there
no
doubt
of
that
and
he
pressed
his
cap
on
his
forehead
savagely
struck
a
light
and
lit
his
pipe
and
prepared
to
march
out
though
it
was
still
raining
in
torrents
but
as
he
passed
the
front
window
framed
in
the
red
autumnal
leaves
of
the
virginian
creeper
he
heard
the
voice
more
distinctly
and
he
stopped
and
began
to
tremble
looking
hard
toward
the
window
i
am
a
fool
he
told
himself
i
have
been
thinking
of
her
so
constantly
i
am
so
much
upset
that
i
should
think
any
young
girl
i
happened
to
meet
like
her
any
voice
i
heard
like
hers
this
one
for
instance
is
is
the
perspiration
broke
out
upon
his
forehead
and
the
hand
that
held
the
pipe
shook
for
at
that
moment
the
last
words
of
the
song
died
away
with
a
peculiar
little
trill
a
soft
little
sigh
which
he
remembered
in
leslie
voice
and
hers
alone
most
distinctly
it
is
easily
proved
he
muttered
and
he
stole
across
the
small
square
of
grass
up
to
the
window
and
looked
in
for
a
moment
or
two
the
room
seemed
dark
the
objects
within
it
indistinct
then
he
saw
a
girl
seated
at
the
piano
a
slim
graceful
figure
in
some
black
softly
draping
stuff
that
of
itself
seemed
to
speak
of
leslie
she
was
seated
with
her
back
toward
the
window
but
as
he
leant
on
the
she
moved
her
head
and
a
cry
burst
from
him
it
was
leslie
he
drew
back
from
the
and
leant
against
the
wall
under
the
dripping
virginian
creeper
his
heart
knocking
against
his
ribs
his
lips
parched
and
dry
what
should
he
do
go
into
the
house
and
speak
to
her
ah
not
now
not
now
just
before
his
marriage
and
yet
oh
god
how
hard
it
was
leslie
in
there
leslie
in
there
still
deeming
him
false
and
a
few
words
would
undeceive
her
he
took
a
couple
of
steps
to
the
door
then
pulled
up
and
in
another
moment
or
two
he
would
have
rushed
down
the
path
and
out
of
the
gate
but
there
rose
even
as
he
turned
the
sweet
sad
voice
again
and
his
resolution
melted
like
wax
in
a
furnace
he
opened
the
door
went
along
the
passage
paused
a
moment
to
collect
some
fragment
of
and
then
entered
the
parlor
he
stood
gazing
at
her
with
hungry
longing
eyes
and
an
ache
in
his
heart
which
grew
almost
unendurable
then
he
said
as
softly
as
he
could
leslie
she
stopped
singing
but
did
not
turn
her
head
she
had
in
fancy
heard
him
breathe
her
name
so
often
leslie
he
repeated
drawing
nearer
her
hands
grew
motionless
on
the
keys
and
she
looked
round
then
she
rose
slowly
like
a
ghost
her
face
growing
whiter
and
whiter
her
eyes
dilating
and
yorke
breathed
from
her
parted
lips
leslie
he
said
again
oh
leslie
and
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
she
seemed
to
struggle
against
the
potent
influence
he
exerted
then
she
came
nearer
swaying
a
little
like
one
walking
in
her
sleep
oh
my
darling
my
darling
is
it
you
really
you
he
said
in
a
subdued
voice
as
if
he
feared
to
startle
frighten
her
she
was
almost
in
his
arms
her
bosom
heaving
her
lips
quivering
when
she
seemed
to
remember
and
with
a
cry
the
saddest
he
had
ever
heard
she
swayed
away
from
him
extending
one
hand
as
if
to
keep
him
off
he
caught
the
hand
and
held
it
in
a
grasp
like
that
of
a
vice
you
shrink
from
me
leslie
oh
my
dearest
to
shrink
from
me
she
seemed
to
struggle
for
voice
and
found
it
at
last
why
why
have
you
come
she
breathed
why
have
you
hidden
from
me
he
responded
and
there
was
almost
a
touch
of
indignation
in
the
earnest
pleading
voice
why
did
you
do
it
leslie
oh
god
if
you
knew
what
i
have
suffered
you
have
suffered
she
repeated
ah
no
not
you
it
is
i
she
stopped
and
sighed
deeply
he
almost
forced
her
by
her
hand
into
a
chair
and
knelt
beside
her
leslie
leslie
he
cried
striving
hard
to
speak
calmly
and
coolly
listen
to
me
i
try
and
explain
i
try
and
tell
you
how
this
cruel
thing
has
been
brought
about
it
will
be
hard
work
for
the
words
sound
like
a
jumble
in
my
ears
and
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
keep
myself
from
taking
you
in
my
arms
ah
do
shrink
do
be
frightened
i
will
leave
you
to
be
the
judge
when
when
you
have
heard
all
leslie
that
woman
finetta
she
started
and
turned
her
face
from
him
leslie
leslie
she
lied
she
told
you
she
was
to
be
my
wife
it
was
not
true
then
or
ever
as
heaven
is
my
witness
there
was
not
even
love
between
us
on
my
side
i
had
parted
from
her
two
days
before
oh
hush
she
broke
out
with
a
kind
of
jerk
i
remember
every
word
every
word
it
is
burnt
into
my
heart
it
was
false
he
said
vehemently
i
can
understand
imagine
all
she
would
say
she
is
an
actress
would
have
deceived
a
woman
of
the
world
much
more
easily
one
all
innocence
and
purity
like
yourself
dearest
she
looked
at
him
as
if
a
glimmer
of
hope
was
dawning
then
her
face
clouded
again
and
she
tried
to
take
her
hand
from
his
but
unsuccessfully
you
you
forget
she
murmured
the
portrait
you
sent
it
to
her
the
day
you
sent
my
gift
to
me
your
portrait
he
could
have
groaned
no
he
thundered
gripping
her
hand
i
sent
that
to
you
to
me
fell
from
her
lips
yes
to
you
the
diamond
thing
i
sent
to
her
listen
and
believe
me
leslie
look
in
my
eyes
ah
dearest
do
you
think
how
could
you
ever
have
thought
that
i
would
be
false
to
you
why
i
should
never
have
believed
you
false
to
me
though
an
angel
had
whispered
it
i
sent
the
pendant
to
her
because
we
had
been
good
friends
and
and
ah
i
must
speak
openly
because
i
knew
that
she
wished
we
might
be
something
more
it
was
a
parting
gift
a
parting
gift
from
friend
to
friend
that
was
all
but
fate
chose
that
i
like
a
fool
should
misdirect
the
packages
leslie
the
portrait
was
for
you
the
diamonds
for
her
ah
think
consider
dearest
should
i
send
such
a
thing
to
you
to
you
whose
taste
is
so
pure
and
refined
she
began
to
tremble
and
he
drew
still
nearer
to
her
why
why
did
you
not
come
and
tell
me
this
sooner
she
almost
wailed
he
hung
his
head
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
up
and
met
her
eyes
steadily
leslie
i
will
tell
you
all
i
i
have
wronged
you
cruelly
i
have
been
a
fool
yes
so
great
so
insensate
a
fool
as
to
believe
that
having
learned
the
imposition
we
had
practised
on
you
having
discovered
that
i
was
not
the
duke
of
rothbury
you
repented
of
our
engagement
you
were
not
the
duke
of
rothbury
she
said
her
brows
knit
are
you
not
oh
if
dolph
were
only
here
he
groaned
no
dearest
i
am
not
and
at
that
time
there
was
little
chance
of
my
ever
being
the
duke
it
is
dolph
temple
as
we
called
him
who
is
the
duke
it
was
a
whim
a
freak
of
his
oh
you
see
yes
she
saw
and
the
color
came
to
her
face
and
a
proud
wounded
look
into
her
lovely
eyes
and
and
you
thought
that
it
was
because
i
believed
you
to
be
a
duke
and
only
because
of
that
that
i
leslie
here
on
my
knees
i
plead
guilty
you
can
not
despise
me
more
than
i
despise
myself
but
dearest
think
the
last
words
you
spoke
to
dolph
the
morning
you
parted
with
him
think
was
there
not
some
slight
excuse
she
hung
her
head
it
it
is
all
past
now
she
said
at
last
with
a
deep
sigh
we
can
not
it
all
ah
no
and
she
turned
her
face
away
as
a
tear
rolled
down
her
cheek
before
that
tear
he
lost
his
he
forgot
lady
eleanor
forgot
that
his
as
fixed
was
within
a
few
hours
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
she
uttered
a
low
cry
and
bent
away
from
him
her
hands
against
his
breast
but
before
the
fire
the
anguish
of
appeal
in
his
eyes
her
own
fell
she
trembled
and
quivered
like
an
imprisoned
bird
then
felt
herself
crushed
against
his
breast
oh
my
darling
my
darling
he
murmured
brokenly
as
if
you
and
i
could
part
again
no
no
never
again
while
life
lasts
never
again
dearest
oh
do
cry
he
kissed
the
tears
away
and
laid
her
face
against
his
lovingly
protectingly
do
cry
leslie
or
i
shall
think
you
can
never
forgive
me
and
he
looked
at
the
black
dress
where
is
your
father
oh
yorke
yorke
she
sobbed
hush
hush
dearest
and
you
bore
it
all
alone
he
groaned
and
i
should
have
been
by
your
side
to
help
and
comfort
you
what
shall
i
say
what
shall
i
do
to
prove
my
remorse
it
was
all
my
fault
no
no
she
responded
not
all
yorke
i
i
ought
not
to
have
believed
that
that
woman
i
felt
that
she
was
not
not
a
good
woman
and
i
ought
not
to
have
trusted
her
but
the
portrait
yorke
it
all
seemed
so
clear
so
conclusive
i
know
he
said
gravely
i
have
heard
it
from
her
own
lips
from
her
own
lips
yes
he
said
gently
she
has
confessed
it
all
if
she
sinned
she
has
been
punished
finetta
the
dancing
girl
will
never
dance
again
she
is
helpless
and
crippled
for
life
leslie
uttered
a
low
cry
of
horror
and
shuddered
oh
god
forgive
me
and
i
was
just
wishing
she
might
be
punished
oh
yorke
where
is
she
i
i
can
not
forget
her
temptation
and
i
i
will
try
and
forgive
her
she
wants
to
see
you
dearest
he
said
i
left
her
this
morning
with
a
prayer
for
your
forgiveness
on
her
lips
i
will
take
you
to
see
her
and
she
will
explain
all
that
may
be
still
dark
see
she
sent
you
this
and
he
put
the
locket
in
her
hand
but
dearest
i
want
to
hear
all
about
yourself
why
are
you
here
and
are
you
here
alone
i
am
the
teacher
here
she
said
let
me
go
now
yorke
dear
no
no
he
said
i
can
not
and
he
held
her
still
closer
tell
it
to
me
with
your
head
lying
on
my
shoulder
your
heart
to
mine
he
stopped
suddenly
and
leslie
following
his
eyes
would
have
broken
from
him
for
two
persons
had
entered
lucy
and
ralph
duncombe
but
yorke
still
held
her
lucy
uttered
a
low
cry
of
amazement
and
the
color
flew
to
her
face
oh
come
away
she
whispered
to
ralph
but
he
strode
in
and
confronted
yorke
with
indignant
menace
no
he
said
sternly
i
am
miss
lisle
friend
and
it
is
my
duty
to
protect
her
to
protect
her
repeated
yorke
mechanically
and
staring
at
him
yes
said
ralph
leslie
miss
lisle
do
you
know
who
this
gentleman
is
leslie
white
and
red
by
turns
raised
her
eyes
yes
she
said
almost
inaudibly
ralph
duncombe
started
you
know
who
he
is
and
and
that
he
is
engaged
to
be
married
to
lady
eleanor
dallas
the
day
after
chapter
xli
it
is
the
truth
leslie
looked
at
ralph
duncombe
vacantly
for
a
moment
as
if
she
had
failed
to
understand
him
then
the
color
began
to
ebb
from
her
face
and
left
it
white
and
she
strove
feebly
to
release
herself
from
enfolding
arms
he
did
not
speak
but
he
glared
at
ralph
duncombe
in
a
kind
of
fury
lucy
was
the
first
to
break
the
awful
silence
which
followed
announcement
oh
no
no
it
is
not
it
can
not
be
true
there
must
be
some
mistake
ralph
she
exclaimed
almost
inaudibly
ralph
duncombe
bit
his
lip
he
had
spoken
in
the
first
heat
of
his
amazement
and
indignation
and
was
perhaps
sorry
that
he
had
done
so
or
at
any
rate
that
he
had
spoken
so
precipitately
it
is
true
he
said
doggedly
ask
him
it
is
for
him
to
explain
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
yorke
the
two
women
with
an
anxious
expectant
look
in
them
as
if
they
were
only
waiting
for
his
contradiction
and
denial
but
his
face
grew
as
white
as
leslie
and
after
looking
round
wildly
he
hung
his
head
and
groaned
leslie
drew
herself
away
from
him
slowly
her
gaze
still
fixed
on
him
her
bosom
heaving
and
dropped
the
locket
from
her
hand
it
went
with
a
dull
thud
to
the
floor
she
had
been
in
paradise
a
moment
or
two
ago
had
been
filled
with
a
joy
which
in
its
intensity
almost
atoned
for
the
past
months
of
sorrow
and
anguish
and
now
she
was
plunged
back
into
the
depths
again
it
was
lucy
who
spoke
again
losing
her
timidity
in
her
anxiety
for
the
friend
she
loved
so
dearly
she
glided
to
yorke
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
oh
speak
sir
she
implored
him
say
that
it
is
not
true
do
you
see
that
she
is
waiting
and
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
leslie
yorke
followed
her
eyes
then
looked
down
at
her
pretty
anxious
face
despairingly
i
can
not
fell
from
his
lips
lucy
shrank
back
from
him
and
stole
her
arm
round
leslie
to
support
her
you
can
not
oh
ralph
duncombe
came
further
into
the
room
he
can
not
deny
it
he
said
i
know
am
a
friend
of
lady
eleanor
dallas
i
know
this
gentleman
though
he
does
not
know
me
he
is
lord
auchester
the
heir
now
to
the
duke
of
rothbury
and
he
is
engaged
to
marry
lady
eleanor
the
wedding
is
to
take
place
the
day
after
i
am
sorry
yes
i
am
sorry
that
i
blurted
out
the
truth
but
the
sight
of
him
well
i
am
an
old
friend
of
miss
lisle
and
i
claim
the
right
to
protect
her
if
his
lordship
considers
that
i
have
exceeded
a
friend
privilege
he
is
at
liberty
to
demand
any
satisfaction
i
can
give
him
yorke
raised
his
head
his
face
was
set
and
white
his
eyes
heavy
with
despair
he
felt
as
the
ancient
gladiator
felt
at
the
moment
the
fatal
net
caught
him
in
its
meshes
and
the
dagger
was
descending
to
strike
him
to
the
heart
as
the
miserable
wretch
in
the
dock
feels
when
the
sentence
of
death
is
being
pronounced
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
speak
and
he
wiped
the
cold
sweat
from
his
face
mechanically
then
he
said
in
a
low
broken
voice
it
is
the
truth
he
looked
at
leslie
scarcely
imploringly
so
much
as
hopelessly
despairingly
i
had
forgotten
it
yes
he
went
on
almost
fiercely
i
had
forgotten
it
i
was
so
happy
that
i
lost
all
memory
of
it
you
sir
who
came
as
an
accuser
who
no
doubt
think
me
an
utter
blackguard
and
lost
to
all
sense
of
honour
shall
be
my
judge
as
well
as
my
accuser
ralph
duncombe
shook
his
head
i
do
not
wish
he
began
but
yorke
silenced
him
with
a
gesture
that
was
full
of
the
dignity
of
despair
hear
me
please
miss
lisle
and
i
were
engaged
to
be
married
that
is
months
ago
we
met
at
a
place
called
portmaris
and
he
glanced
at
lucy
sir
i
loved
her
as
truly
and
devotedly
as
you
can
love
this
young
lady
we
were
to
have
been
married
you
exclaimed
ralph
duncombe
no
it
was
the
duke
of
rothbury
to
whom
she
was
engaged
yorke
sighed
no
it
was
to
me
he
said
i
exchanged
titles
with
my
cousin
the
duke
why
need
not
be
explained
leslie
miss
lisle
understands
it
was
a
foolish
trick
and
like
most
follies
has
brought
trouble
and
sorrow
in
its
wake
but
for
that
stupid
freak
we
were
to
have
been
married
but
on
the
eve
of
our
marriage
we
were
separated
torn
apart
by
a
wicked
lie
which
aided
by
a
wrongly
addressed
envelope
served
to
ruin
our
happiness
miss
lisle
thought
i
had
deceived
her
and
acting
on
the
promptings
of
a
heart
that
is
all
truth
and
purity
she
cast
me
off
i
lost
her
in
all
senses
of
the
word
and
i
felt
that
i
deserved
to
lose
her
now
sir
call
your
imagination
to
your
aid
look
on
this
young
lady
whom
you
love
and
try
and
put
yourself
in
my
place
picture
to
yourself
my
state
and
condition
having
lost
all
that
made
life
worth
living
ah
you
can
for
ralph
duncombe
looked
down
and
bit
his
lip
yorke
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
sighed
heavily
and
for
a
moment
seemed
as
if
he
had
finished
his
explanation
then
he
looked
up
as
if
awaking
suddenly
i
was
in
that
state
in
which
a
man
might
win
pity
from
his
worst
enemy
but
i
had
an
enemy
of
whose
existence
i
was
and
am
still
ignorant
and
he
chose
that
moment
to
hunt
me
into
still
greater
straits
i
have
been
a
fool
in
more
senses
of
the
word
than
one
i
was
heavily
in
debt
it
was
because
of
that
millstone
of
debt
that
i
had
induced
miss
lisle
to
consent
to
a
secret
marriage
my
enemy
whoever
he
was
discovered
this
he
bought
up
all
my
debts
and
liabilities
and
constituting
himself
my
sole
creditor
he
came
down
upon
me
with
all
the
weight
of
those
debts
meaning
to
crush
me
i
should
have
gone
under
never
to
rise
again
i
should
have
been
ruined
and
disgraced
should
have
brought
disgrace
upon
the
name
i
bear
and
all
connected
with
me
but
he
paused
and
his
face
worked
there
was
one
who
who
had
some
little
regard
for
me
and
and
she
stepped
in
and
saved
me
lifted
me
out
of
the
mire
and
set
me
on
my
feet
again
saved
me
from
the
consequences
of
my
folly
and
saved
the
old
name
from
shame
gratitude
is
a
poor
word
to
describe
what
i
felt
toward
her
i
i
made
the
debt
i
owed
her
still
heavier
by
asking
her
to
take
that
which
she
had
saved
and
and
in
the
goodness
of
her
heart
she
consented
from
that
time
until
now
until
now
i
have
been
true
to
her
in
deed
and
intent
i
have
striven
to
forget
the
woman
to
whom
i
had
given
my
heart
there
at
portmaris
the
woman
who
was
all
the
world
to
me
his
voice
broke
the
woman
whom
i
lost
on
our
wedding
eve
only
have
i
heard
from
the
woman
who
separated
us
a
full
confession
of
the
deception
by
which
she
effected
her
purpose
but
i
knew
it
was
too
late
to
regain
my
lost
happiness
too
late
i
never
expected
to
see
miss
lisle
again
scarcely
hoped
to
do
so
excepting
that
it
might
be
once
before
i
died
that
i
might
say
to
her
all
my
faults
and
follies
i
was
true
to
you
leslie
leslie
standing
rigid
and
motionless
moaned
faintly
he
cast
an
agonized
look
at
her
then
then
i
came
by
the
merest
chance
to
this
cottage
i
heard
her
voice
i
stole
in
and
in
the
joy
of
meeting
her
and
reconciliation
with
her
in
that
great
joy
the
past
was
blotted
out
from
my
mind
and
i
forgot
i
say
i
forgot
that
i
was
betrothed
to
another
that
i
was
within
a
few
hours
of
being
wedded
to
another
his
voice
died
away
and
he
stood
with
downcast
head
and
vacant
eyes
then
he
looked
up
there
is
my
story
sir
you
say
that
you
are
a
friend
of
of
miss
lisle
it
is
for
you
to
demand
exact
satisfaction
for
the
wrong
that
i
have
done
her
but
mind
that
wrong
dates
only
from
i
have
loved
her
he
broke
down
for
a
moment
then
went
on
almost
sternly
what
i
have
to
do
what
i
can
do
to
atone
i
will
do
i
i
can
never
hope
for
miss
lisle
forgiveness
leslie
hands
writhed
together
and
lucy
arm
held
her
still
more
firmly
i
can
never
hope
to
see
her
again
but
i
will
say
this
in
her
hearing
that
i
would
lay
down
my
life
to
wipe
out
the
past
to
render
her
happy
in
the
future
leslie
hands
stole
up
to
her
face
for
the
rest
he
went
on
i
will
tell
lady
eleanor
all
that
i
have
told
you
it
is
her
due
she
shall
be
the
judge
she
shall
dispose
of
my
future
i
owe
her
much
more
than
can
be
told
he
stopped
then
looked
up
and
there
was
a
light
in
his
eyes
which
made
lucy
shrink
one
thing
more
i
have
spoken
of
the
way
in
which
i
was
hunted
down
that
part
of
the
business
is
a
mystery
still
but
i
am
going
to
solve
it
i
am
going
to
find
ralph
duncombe
lucy
broke
from
leslie
and
with
a
cry
of
terror
flung
herself
on
ralph
arm
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
yorke
stern
face
yorke
stopped
and
started
his
face
grew
red
and
then
white
and
he
strode
forward
what
he
cried
under
his
breath
are
you
ralph
duncombe
put
lucy
from
him
gently
and
came
a
step
forward
to
meet
him
yes
he
said
gravely
my
name
is
ralph
duncombe
you
said
yorke
as
if
his
amazement
his
anger
do
you
mean
that
it
is
you
who
bought
up
my
debts
and
hunted
me
down
it
was
i
said
ralph
stolidly
but
but
yorke
groaned
why
why
what
harm
did
i
ever
do
you
why
man
i
never
saw
you
before
i
never
saw
your
name
until
i
read
it
in
the
writs
why
why
and
he
stood
with
clenched
hands
the
veins
standing
out
on
his
forehead
ralph
bit
his
lip
but
he
looked
full
into
yorke
blazing
eyes
why
did
you
do
it
demanded
yorke
in
a
low
voice
which
was
all
the
more
ominous
for
its
quietude
what
was
i
to
you
that
you
should
concern
yourself
in
my
affairs
that
you
should
try
and
ruin
me
it
was
you
who
drove
me
he
was
going
to
say
into
a
marriage
with
lady
eleanor
but
he
stopped
himself
in
time
why
did
you
do
it
ralph
duncombe
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
said
my
lord
i
desired
to
break
off
the
engagement
between
you
and
miss
lisle
you
why
ah
the
light
flashed
upon
him
then
he
glanced
at
lucy
who
stood
trembling
with
one
hand
upon
ralph
arm
yes
said
ralph
but
miss
lisle
had
rejected
me
she
would
never
have
been
my
wife
and
in
saying
this
i
will
say
no
more
i
have
another
reason
that
reason
demanded
yorke
with
barely
restrained
fury
i
decline
to
answer
said
ralph
yorke
made
a
movement
as
if
to
seize
him
or
strike
him
lucy
screamed
leslie
seemed
as
if
to
spring
between
them
then
flung
herself
on
her
knees
beside
a
chair
and
this
recalled
yorke
to
himself
forgive
me
he
murmured
casting
a
glance
at
her
then
in
a
loud
tone
he
said
to
ralph
significantly
this
is
not
the
place
for
a
scene
duncombe
i
shall
demand
an
explanation
from
you
elsewhere
i
i
will
go
now
he
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
and
his
face
lost
its
fury
as
he
turned
it
to
leslie
kneeling
with
her
face
in
her
hands
yes
i
will
go
now
les
miss
lisle
forgive
me
all
the
trouble
and
sorrow
i
have
caused
you
god
knows
as
i
said
i
would
lay
down
my
life
to
win
a
happiness
for
you
i
i
think
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
know
that
i
i
have
been
a
wretchedly
unfortunate
man
it
is
all
my
own
fault
i
dare
say
and
yet
well
all
the
talking
in
the
world
will
not
talk
out
the
past
will
not
help
me
through
the
future
god
bless
you
leslie
his
voice
broke
into
a
kind
of
sob
and
he
strode
toward
the
door
as
he
did
so
as
with
misery
he
fumbled
at
the
handle
the
door
opened
from
the
outside
and
a
tall
figure
stood
on
the
threshold
it
was
lady
eleanor
dallas
she
was
wrapped
in
a
very
dark
cloak
dripping
wet
above
which
her
beautiful
face
gleamed
white
as
that
of
a
grecian
statue
she
held
the
door
and
leaned
against
it
to
support
herself
and
the
hand
she
raised
as
if
to
stop
him
shook
and
quivered
as
if
with
ague
stop
yorke
she
moaned
rather
than
said
chapter
xlii
love
and
pride
eleanor
he
said
hoarsely
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
found
it
impossible
to
speak
for
a
moment
then
she
drew
herself
upright
and
pushed
the
wet
hair
from
her
forehead
yes
it
is
i
she
said
in
a
low
voice
in
which
agony
and
pride
struggled
for
the
mastery
where
where
did
you
come
from
how
long
yes
she
said
answering
his
unfinished
question
i
have
been
listening
they
told
me
at
home
that
you
had
gone
out
to
look
for
me
and
i
followed
you
i
heard
your
voice
as
i
was
passing
and
i
came
into
the
garden
i
have
been
standing
by
the
window
and
every
word
fell
from
her
white
lips
you
you
should
not
have
listened
he
said
come
away
and
he
put
out
his
hand
as
if
to
draw
her
outside
but
she
did
not
move
i
am
going
presently
she
said
speaking
as
if
with
an
effort
i
i
want
to
say
something
yorke
she
seemed
as
if
she
were
about
to
break
down
but
mastered
her
emotion
and
came
a
step
or
two
farther
into
the
room
yorke
you
have
not
heard
all
yet
not
the
whole
truth
he
she
glanced
at
ralph
duncombe
could
not
tell
you
but
i
will
a
presentiment
of
what
was
coming
fell
on
yorke
and
he
tried
to
stop
her
no
he
said
say
no
more
eleanor
but
come
home
with
me
i
can
not
she
said
i
must
speak
miss
lisle
she
drew
nearer
to
leslie
who
had
risen
and
stood
against
the
window
her
hands
clasped
her
head
turned
away
miss
lisle
you
have
been
cruelly
wronged
and
by
me
leslie
started
and
looked
up
quickly
lady
eleanor
gazed
at
her
seeing
her
face
distinctly
for
the
first
time
and
so
the
two
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
these
two
beautiful
women
who
were
fated
to
love
the
same
man
it
was
i
who
who
separated
you
from
lord
auchester
yorke
held
up
his
hand
to
stop
her
eleanor
but
she
did
not
remove
her
eyes
from
leslie
face
yes
i
it
was
i
who
employed
duncombe
to
buy
the
debts
and
summon
lord
auchester
ralph
duncombe
looked
up
is
is
this
necessary
lady
eleanor
he
said
gravely
i
am
ready
to
take
all
the
responsibility
no
she
said
it
was
i
the
woman
finetta
told
me
that
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
and
i
did
all
i
could
to
prevent
it
you
wonder
that
i
should
admit
it
she
smiled
with
a
mixture
of
pride
and
despair
i
have
told
you
that
i
have
been
standing
by
the
window
there
and
have
heard
all
do
you
think
that
i
would
hold
lord
auchester
to
his
promise
that
i
would
consent
to
his
marrying
me
now
that
i
know
he
is
in
love
with
another
woman
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
lips
curved
haughtily
though
her
voice
was
as
low
as
before
i
tell
you
this
now
she
went
on
that
lord
auchester
may
not
hold
duncombe
to
blame
the
sin
if
sin
there
was
was
mine
and
i
atone
for
it
as
she
spoke
the
last
words
she
glided
across
the
room
and
stood
in
front
of
leslie
miss
lisle
if
i
were
to
say
that
i
am
sorry
you
would
not
believe
me
you
are
a
woman
like
myself
and
you
will
understand
i
knew
lord
auchester
before
you
did
and
she
looked
round
haughtily
i
loved
him
if
there
is
any
shame
in
that
i
accept
it
he
knew
that
i
loved
him
for
god
sake
be
silent
come
away
exclaimed
yorke
almost
inaudibly
she
glanced
at
him
as
if
she
scarcely
saw
him
it
was
the
happiest
proudest
day
of
my
life
when
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
and
and
in
the
conviction
that
i
could
and
should
make
him
happy
i
did
not
regret
the
means
by
which
i
had
won
him
i
forgot
you
see
she
smiled
bitterly
that
the
day
of
reckoning
might
come
it
has
come
and
i
face
it
all
the
world
may
know
the
story
no
no
oh
no
panted
lucy
whose
gentle
heart
was
melted
by
the
agony
which
she
knew
this
proud
woman
was
suffering
lady
eleanor
did
not
even
look
at
her
i
do
not
care
who
knows
she
said
i
have
made
my
confession
and
i
have
done
with
it
she
made
an
eloquent
gesture
with
her
hands
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
she
said
addressing
leslie
in
a
low
distinct
voice
i
do
not
ask
for
your
forgiveness
miss
lisle
if
i
stood
in
your
place
i
should
find
it
as
impossible
to
forgive
as
you
do
i
will
not
even
utter
the
conventional
wish
that
you
may
be
happy
i
tried
to
ruin
your
happiness
in
securing
my
own
and
i
have
failed
let
that
console
you
as
it
will
torture
me
if
you
need
further
consolation
take
it
in
the
assurance
that
he
has
loved
you
all
the
time
he
has
been
promised
to
me
yes
she
said
with
a
deep
sigh
i
have
felt
that
all
through
his
heart
was
always
yours
never
mine
if
this
evening
work
had
never
been
if
we
had
married
he
would
have
gone
on
loving
you
and
my
punishment
would
have
been
greater
than
it
is
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
still
looking
at
leslie
she
said
inaudibly
to
the
rest
that
woman
finetta
lied
when
she
spoke
of
you
yes
i
can
understand
how
he
came
to
choose
you
before
me
she
turned
and
drew
her
cloak
round
her
and
moved
to
the
door
yorke
started
as
if
roused
from
a
kind
of
stupor
and
went
forward
as
if
to
accompany
her
but
she
drew
away
from
him
your
place
is
here
she
said
icily
not
with
me
he
stopped
irresolute
half
dazed
by
conflicting
emotions
and
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
ralph
duncombe
i
ordered
my
carriage
to
follow
me
she
said
in
a
dull
mechanical
voice
will
you
see
if
it
is
on
the
road
mr
duncombe
he
started
forward
and
offered
his
arm
but
yorke
motioned
him
aside
and
took
her
hand
no
he
said
hoarsely
my
place
is
by
your
side
you
are
my
promised
wife
eleanor
he
spoke
the
words
in
the
tone
a
man
might
use
who
is
about
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
which
must
end
in
death
as
a
man
who
is
resigning
all
chance
of
happiness
she
understood
and
smiled
bitterly
as
she
drew
her
hand
from
his
pardon
me
lord
auchester
she
said
pointing
bitterly
to
leslie
there
stands
your
promised
wife
and
with
one
long
look
into
his
face
she
turned
and
left
them
yorke
was
a
gentleman
he
could
not
let
the
woman
whom
he
was
pledged
to
marry
in
a
few
hours
go
out
into
the
night
like
an
outcast
he
followed
her
and
ralph
duncombe
eleanor
he
said
in
deep
agitation
you
will
let
me
come
with
you
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
on
the
muddy
road
and
she
stood
and
listened
to
them
rather
than
to
him
eleanor
think
what
you
do
he
said
i
stand
by
my
promise
my
engagement
notwithstanding
notwithstanding
that
i
obtained
it
by
a
fraud
she
said
turning
her
eyes
upon
him
yes
i
knew
you
would
say
that
and
i
am
grateful
but
you
forget
yorke
i
heard
every
word
you
said
you
would
give
me
what
not
yourself
not
your
heart
you
can
not
it
belongs
to
her
go
to
her
forget
me
then
her
voice
broke
her
pride
melted
and
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
her
white
face
drawn
and
haggard
oh
yorke
i
loved
you
so
no
do
not
come
near
me
i
am
not
so
degraded
as
to
accept
such
a
sacrifice
you
love
her
and
i
do
not
wonder
no
i
do
not
wonder
she
is
more
beautiful
than
i
am
and
better
a
thousand
times
better
you
will
make
her
happy
and
oh
how
much
more
is
this
she
will
make
you
happy
go
back
to
her
plead
to
her
kneel
to
her
to
forgive
you
you
will
find
it
hard
these
good
women
are
always
harder
than
we
are
she
would
not
have
done
as
much
to
win
you
as
i
have
and
will
therefore
be
all
the
slower
to
forgive
but
go
and
and
the
carriage
was
drawing
near
she
threw
back
the
hood
of
the
cloak
and
flashed
all
her
proud
white
loveliness
upon
him
when
you
think
of
me
think
of
me
as
i
am
at
this
moment
at
the
moment
i
relinquished
you
he
stood
motionless
and
she
drew
near
and
laid
a
white
hand
upon
each
of
his
shoulders
looked
into
his
eyes
a
lingering
farewell
look
then
as
ralph
duncombe
opened
the
carriage
door
she
let
her
hands
drop
slowly
and
got
into
the
carriage
ralph
was
following
her
but
she
stayed
him
with
a
gesture
no
no
alone
alone
came
from
her
parted
lips
the
word
alone
alone
fell
like
a
funeral
knell
upon
yorke
ear
it
was
the
last
word
he
was
to
hear
from
lady
eleanor
lips
for
many
a
year
the
two
men
stood
and
gazed
after
the
carriage
then
yorke
turned
upon
ralph
duncombe
at
any
rate
i
have
a
man
to
deal
with
now
he
said
savagely
and
one
who
will
not
shrink
from
the
encounter
my
lord
responded
ralph
promptly
you
have
to
account
to
me
for
your
conduct
mr
duncombe
said
yorke
you
have
interfered
in
my
affairs
most
unwarrantably
what
have
you
to
say
ralph
duncombe
flushed
angrily
and
a
passionate
retort
rose
to
his
lips
but
he
crushed
it
down
you
have
every
right
to
demand
an
explanation
lord
auchester
he
said
with
an
unnatural
calmness
and
i
give
it
you
i
interfered
because
i
once
loved
miss
lisle
and
because
i
did
not
consider
you
a
fit
husband
for
her
i
judged
you
by
the
estimate
i
had
formed
on
hearsay
i
thought
that
i
was
doing
miss
lisle
a
service
in
helping
to
prevent
the
marriage
yorke
swore
even
your
anger
shall
not
stop
me
in
confessing
that
i
erred
ralph
went
on
i
was
wrong
i
admit
it
but
i
did
what
i
did
for
the
best
the
best
groaned
yorke
yes
you
can
not
but
know
the
character
the
world
gives
you
a
spendthrift
one
who
carried
on
an
intrigue
with
a
dancing
woman
yorke
held
up
his
hand
no
more
sir
he
said
sternly
but
ralph
went
on
doggedly
i
thought
i
was
acting
wisely
and
righteously
in
preventing
your
marriage
to
such
a
woman
as
leslie
lisle
i
admit
i
was
wrong
and
i
am
ready
to
yield
you
any
satisfaction
you
may
desire
yorke
looked
into
the
honest
face
into
the
steadfast
eyes
for
a
moment
then
he
sighed
you
are
right
i
was
never
worthy
of
her
what
man
of
us
all
is
none
said
ralph
but
notwithstanding
i
say
go
and
ask
her
to
be
your
wife
lord
auchester
yorke
seemed
staggered
by
this
knockdown
advice
and
hung
his
head
then
he
looked
up
breathing
hard
i
will
he
said
and
he
strode
into
the
house
ralph
duncombe
remaining
outside
leslie
had
sunk
into
a
chair
and
lucy
was
kneeling
beside
her
holding
her
hands
and
murmuring
those
inarticulate
words
of
sympathy
and
consolation
which
only
women
can
utter
for
at
such
times
a
man
is
always
an
imbecile
and
a
fool
yorke
strode
in
and
bent
over
the
chair
leslie
he
said
in
a
hoarse
broken
voice
leslie
i
have
come
back
to
you
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
except
that
i
love
you
that
i
have
never
ceased
to
love
you
since
the
first
day
we
met
there
at
portmaris
will
you
forgive
me
will
you

leslie
a
profound
silence
followed
his
impassioned
words
lucy
kneeling
held
leslie
hands
speak
to
him
dear
she
whispered
the
tears
rolling
down
her
face
speak
to
him
leslie
but
leslie
could
not
speak
she
was
a
woman
just
a
woman
and
she
found
it
hard
to
forgive
his
betrothal
to
lady
eleanor
all
else
counted
for
nothing
but
that
she
sat
motionless
and
dumb
i
understand
he
said
almost
inaudibly

leslie
leslie
whispered
lucy
in
an
agony
but

more
than

could
hope

silent

a
groan

ralph
as

out
into
the
darkness
and
the
rain
yorke

his
head
i

he
said
grimly

ralph
moved
to
pity
by
the
despair
and
hopelessness
of
the
voice
why
man
she
loves

yorke
shook
his
head
again
not

he
said
in
a
dull
heavy
way

but
now
i

the
best

his
voice
broke
ralph
duncombe
seized

said

man
leslie
lisle

yorke
disengaged
his
arm
from
ralph
grasp
there
is
no
hope
for
me
he
said
despairingly
i
have
lost
her
and
he
passed
through
the
gate
and
was
swallowed
up
by
the
darkness
lady
eleanor
reached
white
place
and
went
straight
to
her
own
room
and
presently
lady
denby
came
to
her
good
heavens
eleanor
what
have
you
been
doing
to

she
exclaimed
as
she
stared
at
the
dripping
cloak
why
you
are
wet
to
the
skin
you
will
catch
your
death
of
cold
where

spasmodic
laugh

lady

laughed
harshly
he

this
time
it

he
wanted
to

her
that
all

but
but
my
dear
eleanor
lady
eleanor
flung
her
wet
hair
from
her
face
there

said
wearily
he

gone

away
out
of
england

matter
where
and
and
the
day
after
was
to
be
my
wedding
day
no
wedding
day
will
ever
dawn
for
me
she
sank
upon
a
sofa
and
hid
her
face
and
lay
motionless
for
an
hour
lady
denby
standing
near
then
suddenly
lady
eleanor
started
and
raised
her
head
what
was
that
i
heard
nothing
said
lady
denby
i
heard
a
horse
some
one
has
ridden
out
of
the
courtyard
it
is
yorke
that
is
the
last
of
him
it
was
yorke
he
had
walked
swiftly
through
the
lane
to
white
place
and
going
straight
to
the
stable
had
saddled
his
horse
it
a
dark
night
my
lord
said
the
groom
who
held
the
lantern
and
he
looked
curiously
and
apprehensively
at
the
stern
face
an
the
ground
soft
and
slippery
my
lord
he
added
yorke
did
not
however
seem
to
hear
him
but
tossing
him
a
sovereign
leapt
into
the
saddle
and
went
out
of
the
courtyard
at
a
canter
the
horse
was
fresh
and
somewhat
startled
at
being
taken
out
so
late
and
into
the
darkness
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
yorke
would
have
let
him
go
easy
until
he
quieted
down
but
he
had
no
thought
for
the
horse
or
himself
or
anything
else
and
when
they
had
got
outside
the
park
and
on
the
london
road
he
let
the
animal
have
its
head
and
even
touched
it
with
his
heel
this
was
quite
enough
and
they
went
spinning
along
the
slippery
road
at
a
breakneck
pace
it
was
very
dark
the
rain
was
still
coming
down
in
good
old
english
fashion
and
the
horse
was
getting
more
and
more
nervous
as
he
felt
by
some
instinct
that
his
master
was
riding
carelessly
and
recklessly
yorke
scarcely
knew
whether
he
was
riding
or
walking
until
suddenly
he
saw
something
white
flash
along
the
ground
in
front
it
was
only
a
white
cat
but
if
it
had
been
a
ghost
the
horse
could
not
have
been
more
frightened
he
stopped
almost
instantly
and
shied
and
on
striking
him
reared
yorke
was
a
good
rider
and
kept
his
seat
but
when
he
struck
the
horse
again
and
tried
to
force
him
over
the
animal
half
mad
with
fright
reared
still
higher
until
he
stood
as
upright
as
a
circus
horse
then
losing
his
balance
slipped
on
the
greasy
road
and
came
down
backward
on
the
top
of
yorke
it
was
done
in
a
moment
with
scarcely
any
sound
save
the
clatter
and
splash
of
the
horse
hoofs
as
he
rose
and
shook
himself
trembling
and
panting
and
in
the
silence
of
the
night
yorke
lay
motionless
his
whole
length
stretched
out
upon
the
ground
the
rain
beating
down
upon
his
upturned
face
ralph
duncombe
had
gone
to
the
inn
and
the
two
girls
left
alone
were
still
in
the
parlor
leslie
had
scarcely
changed
her
attitude
and
seemed
sunk
in
lethargic
indifference
which
was
really
the
result
of
exhaustion
and
though
she
listened
to
lucy
arguments
and
prayers
made
no
response
to
them
lucy
pleaded
hard
for
yorke
with
a
woman
quick
insight
she
had
pierced
the
haze
by
which
his
actions
and
motives
seemed
obscured
and
had
jumped
at
rather
than
worked
out
the
whole
truth
are
you
going
to
let
him
go
leslie
she
asked
for
the
twentieth
time
after
all
he
has
suffered
i
have
suffered
also
said
leslie
at
last
but
through
no
fault
of
his
or
at
any
rate
not
entirely
through
his
fault
is
it
because
he
changed
titles
with
the
duke
that
you
are
so
angry
and
will
not
forgive
him
leslie
shook
her
head
i
do
not
care
about
that
she
said
simply
is
it
because
he
was
so
great
a
friend
with
that
dancing
woman
leslie
face
flushed
but
she
shook
her
head
no
said
lucy
quickly
he
had
not
seen
you
then
remember
he
said
to
her
after
he
had
met
you
you
need
want
any
more
than
that
what
is
it
then
ah
it
is
because
of
his
engagement
to
lady
eleanor
leslie
turned
her
face
away
her
brows
drawn
together
but
think
dear
pleaded
lucy
what
could
he
do
lady
eleanor
had
saved
him
from
ruin
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
she
and
ralph
who
had
driven
him
into
a
corner
remember
she
had
saved
him
and
he
knew
that
she
loved
him
and
he
thought
that
you
had
thrown
him
over
oh
leslie
he
only
did
what
any
man
would
have
done
forgive
him
dear
he
loves
you
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
any
one
a
woman
especially
can
see
that
there
you
are
trembling
leslie
let
your
heart
speak
for
you
let
me
send
for
him
and
she
rose
as
if
she
meant
to
sally
out
that
moment
and
bring
yorke
back
but
leslie
caught
her
arm
no
she
said
with
a
set
face
i
must
think
i
can
not
forget
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
to
lady
eleanor
the
day
after
it
is
better
that
he
should
keep
to
his
engagement
to
that
lady
she
could
forgive
him
everything
but
his
betrothal
to
lady
eleanor
as
she
spoke
she
kissed
lucy
and
went
to
her
own
room
in
crossing
the
parlor
she
saw
the
locket
with
yorke
portrait
lying
on
the
floor
she
paused
a
moment
a
moment
only
then
went
on
and
left
it
lying
there
but
half
an
hour
afterward
when
all
was
still
the
door
opened
and
she
entered
the
room
and
picked
up
the
locket
gazed
at
the
portrait
and
was
about
to
press
it
to
her
lips
when
she
stopped
and
shuddered
remembering
in
whose
keeping
the
locket
had
been
indeed
she
was
about
to
drop
it
on
the
floor
again
when
a
singular
sound
broke
the
stillness
it
was
as
if
some
one
were
moving
in
the
garden
she
thrust
the
locket
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
went
to
the
window
the
rain
had
ceased
and
there
was
a
glimmer
of
moonlight
between
the
clouds
by
this
uncertain
light
she
saw
something
standing
on
the
small
lawn
she
was
rather
frightened
for
a
moment
till
she
saw
it
was
a
horse
she
was
not
in
a
condition
of
mind
to
care
very
much
about
the
garden
but
she
thought
of
lucy
pride
in
it
and
fondness
for
it
and
she
opened
the
door
and
stole
out
intending
to
drive
the
horse
which
she
suspected
had
strayed
from
one
of
the
adjoining
meadows
through
the
gate
but
when
she
got
near
it
she
saw
that
it
was
saddled
she
did
not
immediately
realize
the
significance
of
this
fact
then
it
flashed
upon
her
and
she
ran
into
the
house
and
into
lucy
room
lucy
was
still
dressed
and
seemed
to
expect
her
i
heard
you
moving
about
dear
she
said
lovingly
and
i
knew
you
would
come
to
tell
me
that
you
had
forgiven
him
and
taken
him
back
no
no
exclaimed
leslie
come
come
at
once
they
ran
down
hand
in
hand
and
lucy
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
as
she
saw
the
horse
oh
my
dahlias
leslie
oh
oh
hush
said
leslie
in
a
whisper
do
you
see
it
is
saddled
there
has
been
an
accident
get
the
lantern
lucy
quick
i
will
catch
the
horse
no
no
you
can
not
but
leslie
went
up
to
the
great
creature
guardedly
and
after
a
moment
fidgeting
he
allowed
her
to
get
hold
of
the
bridle
lucy
was
back
with
the
lantern
in
a
moment
or
two
and
stood
trembling
it
was
leslie
who
was
calm
and
cool
now
look
lucy
there
is
blood
on
his
shoulder
and
back
he
has
fallen
and
and
i
am
afraid
for
his
rider
wait
she
snatched
the
lantern
from
lucy
hand
and
running
to
the
road
examined
it
thank
god
for
the
rain
she
said
fervently
see
every
hoof
mark
she
slung
the
bridle
over
the
gate
and
holding
the
lantern
close
to
the
ground
followed
the
tracks
it
was
lucy
who
first
saw
the
motionless
figure
lying
in
the
road
and
she
uttered
a
faint
scream
in
another
moment
she
was
kneeling
beside
it
and
then
she
stretched
out
her
arm
as
if
to
hide
the
white
face
from
leslie
keep
back
do
come
near
she
gasped
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
oh
leslie
leslie
it
is
he
leslie
sank
on
to
her
knees
and
put
lucy
arm
aside
and
looked
at
the
face
he
is
dead
she
screamed
dead
i
have
killed
him
and
uttering
heartbroken
wails
like
some
wild
distraught
creature
she
took
his
head
upon
her
bosom
and
held
it
there
calling
upon
his
name
in
an
agony
of
despair
and
remorse
chapter
xliii
leslie
your
wife
lucy
stood
and
wrung
her
hands
looking
round
helplessly
almost
terrified
out
of
her
senses
by
leslie
terrible
outburst
of
passionate
grief
but
her
helplessness
lasted
only
for
a
moment
or
two
she
bent
down
and
shook
literally
shook
leslie
shoulder
he
is
not
dead
she
said
but
he
will
be
if
we
let
him
lie
here
she
had
hit
upon
the
surest
way
of
rousing
leslie
she
stopped
the
awful
wailing
held
yorke
face
from
her
and
looked
at
it
oh
with
what
a
scrutiny
then
sprang
to
her
feet
help
me
she
said
through
her
clenched
teeth
and
she
put
her
arms
around
yorke
broad
shoulders
and
raised
him
from
the
ground
she
felt
strong
enough
to
carry
him
by
herself
between
them
they
carried
him
into
the
house
and
into
lucy
room
now
i
will
go
for
the
doctor
said
leslie
with
a
calmness
which
terrified
lucy
almost
as
much
as
her
grief
had
done
but
lucy
snatched
up
her
shawl
no
i
will
go
you
must
stay
with
him
you
you
will
not
break
down
leslie
a
smile
crossed
leslie
white
face
and
sufficiently
answered
lucy
sped
away
when
she
came
back
with
the
doctor
they
found
that
leslie
had
heaven
only
knows
how
got
off
yorke
saturated
coat
and
waistcoat
and
washed
the
blood
from
his
face
and
she
stood
outside
the
door
holding
lucy
hand
calm
and
composed
while
the
doctor
made
his
examination
then
he
called
them
in
no
bones
broken
thank
god
he
said
the
horse
must
have
fallen
on
him
and
i
was
afraid
but
he
has
struck
his
head
and
there
is
mischief
in
a
blow
like
this
he
will
want
careful
nursing
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
leslie
moved
forward
a
little
the
doctor
nodded
very
good
he
said
as
if
accepting
her
and
he
began
at
once
to
give
her
the
necessary
instructions
when
he
comes
to
he
must
be
kept
quiet
ralph
who
had
been
fetched
by
the
doctor
man
entered
the
room
and
the
doctor
sent
him
into
the
village
for
some
things
he
required
on
the
way
ralph
roused
the
postmaster
and
sent
a
telegram
to
the
duke
of
rothbury
the
two
girls
and
the
doctor
watched
beside
yorke
throughout
the
morning
but
he
still
lay
motionless
and
apparently
lifeless
the
doctor
face
grew
graver
as
the
hours
passed
and
he
drew
ralph
aside
better
send
for
his
friends
he
said
i
had
hoped
to
bring
him
round
before
this
there
is
lady
eleanor
dallas
ralph
started
he
and
the
rest
of
them
had
forgotten
her
he
got
on
yorke
horse
and
rode
full
pelt
for
white
place
their
ladyships
left
by
the
first
train
this
morning
for
the
continent
sir
said
the
butler
paris
i
think
but
i
not
sure
i
was
to
wait
till
they
sent
their
address
ralph
rode
back
and
whispered
the
result
of
his
message
to
lucy
she
looked
relieved
i
i
am
not
sorry
she
said
if
she
had
come
leslie
would
have
gone
perhaps
no
i
am
not
sorry
oh
ralph
if
he
should
die
in
the
afternoon
a
fly
drove
up
to
the
door
and
grey
helped
the
duke
out
he
was
as
white
as
the
face
that
lay
on
the
pillow
upstairs
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
could
not
speak
but
sat
with
lightly
folded
hands
listening
as
ralph
told
the
whole
strange
story
take
me
to
him
he
said
at
last
they
took
him
upstairs
and
he
started
at
sight
of
leslie
beside
the
bed
then
he
held
out
his
hand
and
leslie
put
hers
into
it
without
a
word
indeed
almost
indifferently
and
without
removing
her
eyes
from
yorke
face
for
her
all
the
world
lay
there
hovering
between
life
and
death
he
stood
watching
yorke
for
some
time
then
he
went
downstairs
again
will
he
live
he
asked
the
doctor
the
doctor
gave
the
usual
shake
of
the
head
and
shrug
it
is
a
difficult
case
your
grace
he
said
vaguely
the
duke
put
his
hand
before
his
eyes
for
a
moment
or
two
if
he
should
die
it
will
kill
her
he
had
been
watching
leslie
face
as
well
as
yorke
two
days
passed
a
stillness
like
that
of
death
itself
reigned
over
the
little
house
toward
evening
lucy
implored
leslie
to
go
to
her
room
and
take
some
rest
and
leave
him
was
the
only
response
and
she
held
the
limp
hand
still
more
tightly
the
night
fell
and
leslie
had
sunk
on
her
knees
with
her
face
on
the
dear
hand
praying
silently
when
she
felt
the
hand
against
her
cheek
move
she
raised
her
head
and
motioned
to
lucy
and
the
doctor
and
they
drew
back
the
hand
moved
again
and
presently
the
thrill
that
was
almost
an
agony
in
its
intensity
ran
warm
through
leslie
heart
for
she
saw
the
eyes
she
had
watched
hour
by
hour
open
slowly
there
was
no
life
or
intelligence
in
them
for
a
minute
or
so
but
leslie
bent
over
him
and
whispered
his
name
they
lighted
up
and
a
smile
flickered
on
his
face
and
his
lips
moved
she
bent
still
lower
and
heard
him
surely
no
other
could
have
caught
those
faint
accents
whisper
her
name
yes
it
is
leslie
she
said
he
smiled
again
and
his
fingers
closed
over
hers
weakly
and
yet
clingingly
that
that
right
my
darling
he
said
i
knew
you
come
i
driven
stevens
at
the
club
half
wild
about
that
telegram
but
i
i
give
him
a
note
leslie
yes
she
murmured
i
got
the
certificate
license
whatever
you
call
it
and
we
be
married
her
face
flushed
and
the
tears
blinded
her
i
too
busy
now
to
tell
you
how
i
love
you
for
trusting
me
dearest
but
i
tell
you
after
its
all
over
the
snuggest
little
church
got
everything
read
where
a
cab
where
he
stopped
and
a
shudder
ran
through
him
and
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
swiftly
leslie
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
grief
and
dread
where
are
you
i
have
lost
you
lost
you
leslie
come
back
to
me
oh
god
she
has
gone
gone
forever
come
back
to
me
dearest
dearest
the
doctor
stepped
forward
hurriedly
with
a
grave
anxiety
in
his
manner
but
leslie
motioned
him
back
she
put
her
arm
round
yorke
and
laid
her
face
against
his
her
own
scarlet
and
white
by
turns
and
in
a
voice
inaudible
to
the
rest
whispered
i
am
here
dear
yorke
do
you
know
have
you
forgotten
it
is
i
leslie
your
wife
he
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
a
smile
broke
over
his
face
and
he
laughed
as
he
turned
his
face
to
her
i
i
must
have
been
dreaming
leslie
he
said
joyfully
yes
it
what
an
idiot
i
am
i
forgot
we
were
married
yesterday
think
of
it
where
are
we
on
the
steamer
in
italy
where
my
my
head
feels
queer
and
the
things
work
about
me
just
just
tell
me
again
dearest
it
is
leslie
your
wife
she
murmured
her
love
telling
her
what
he
wanted
yes
yes
he
murmured
with
a
laugh
of
infinite
content
married
yesterday
of
course
stupid
things
dreams
leslie
my
wife
married
yesterday
then
with
a
sigh
of
blissful
assurance
and
perfect
peace
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
on
her
bosom
lucy
stood
crying
the
tears
were
rolling
down
the
duke
wan
cheeks
and
even
the
doctor
found
it
necessary
to
turn
his
head
away
then
lucy
found
herself
outside
the
room
sobbing
on
ralph
shoulder
oh
i
am
so
happy
so
happy
she
sobbed
it
is
all
right
now
all
right
he
said
with
masculine
density
yes
do
you
see
did
you
hear
opening
her
eyes
she
is
bound
to
marry
him
now
why
it
almost
as
if
they
were
married
already
chapter
xliv
husband
and
brother
the
great
duke
who
built
rothbury
castle
was
no
fool
he
chose
the
best
of
the
hills
placed
his
house
on
the
brow
amidst
a
belt
of
oaks
and
elms
and
surrounded
by
lawns
he
made
the
body
and
the
two
wings
in
a
long
facade
facing
due
south
and
all
along
the
front
he
ran
a
terrace
of
white
stone
with
flights
of
broad
steps
leading
down
to
the
lawns
and
italian
gardens
which
were
then
in
vogue
from
this
terrace
a
view
was
obtained
which
was
almost
if
not
quite
as
grand
as
that
which
enraptures
the
gaze
from
richmond
hill
while
looked
at
from
below
the
castle
presented
an
appearance
which
might
well
be
described
as
magnificent
each
succeeding
duke
had
done
what
he
could
to
improve
or
at
any
rate
maintain
the
ancestral
home
and
all
england
was
proud
of
rothbury
castle
on
an
evening
in
june
the
duke
was
seated
in
his
in
a
corner
of
the
terrace
looking
wistfully
and
expectantly
towards
the
most
distant
part
of
the
drive
which
wound
round
and
about
the
tall
elms
like
a
yellow
snake
beside
him
stood
grey
also
looking
expectant
and
every
now
and
then
covertly
glancing
at
his
watch
behind
his
back
just
below
the
terrace
was
an
arch
composed
of
laurels
studded
with
roses
the
great
flag
and
the
rothbury
arms
floated
from
one
of
the
towers
and
other
flags
flapped
in
the
soft
breeze
from
venetian
masts
and
lines
stretched
from
point
to
point
of
the
castle
and
grounds
servants
in
their
dark
claret
livery
hurried
to
and
fro
or
stood
in
groups
looking
toward
the
same
spot
on
which
the
duke
eye
was
fixed
the
hall
door
was
open
wide
and
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
stood
the
general
servants
of
the
household
all
of
them
from
the
stately
housekeeper
in
satin
to
the
in
her
black
stuff
dress
and
white
apron
in
fact
the
whole
place
was
in
a
state
of
pleasant
excitement
and
no
one
excepting
the
duke
in
his
chair
seemed
able
to
keep
still
in
one
place
for
more
than
a
minute
at
a
time
that
train
late
grey
said
the
duke
with
a
painfully
poor
attempt
at
indifference
it
always
is
late
see
that
i
write
to
the
traffic
director
about
it
will
you
it
is
something
shameful
the
way
this
line
is
mismanaged
it
must
be
twenty
minutes
late
i
know
not
quite
your
grace
about
a
quarter
i
should
say
said
grey
pulling
out
his
watch
oh
put
that
watch
away
said
the
duke
you
have
lugged
it
out
twenty
times
during
the
last
half
hour
do
you
think
i
have
seen
you
i
wish
to
heaven
you
go
away
if
you
must
fidget
beg
pardon
your
grace
said
grey
from
behind
and
hiding
a
smile
shall
i
wheel
your
grace
in
the
air
is
rather
nonsense
it
as
hot
as
as
a
furnace
are
they
coming
yet
they
seem
to
forget
that
i
a
director
of
this
beastly
line
by
george
go
down
to
their
next
board
meeting
and
make
it
hot
for
them
more
accidents
occur
from
the
unpunctuality
of
trains
than
anything
else
ah
what
that
they
coming
your
grace
exclaimed
grey
the
duke
made
a
movement
as
if
he
were
about
to
rise
then
he
sank
back
with
a
sigh
go
and
tell
them
they
ca
see
as
well
as
we
can
see
that
everything
is
ready
yes
your
grace
but
there
no
need
they
seen
the
carriage
he
added
as
the
servants
began
to
move
about
like
a
hive
of
bees
and
then
as
if
by
mutual
consent
swarmed
upon
the
principal
flight
of
steps
from
the
terrace
the
carriage
with
its
four
white
horses
swept
along
the
avenue
the
postilions
cracking
their
whips
and
keeping
their
steeds
at
a
smart
gallop
and
presently
yorke
who
had
been
leaning
forward
said
the
first
view
of
the
castle
leslie
leslie
bent
forward
eagerly
and
a
faint
cry
of
amazement
and
delight
escaped
her
oh
yorke
how
lovely
how
lovely
she
murmured
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
large
or
so
beautiful
it
is
an
aladdin
palace
and
look
yorke
there
is
an
arch
of
flowers
how
kind
of
them
oh
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
sank
back
i
think
i
am
a
little
frightened
by
it
all
he
leant
his
arm
on
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
the
light
of
a
passionate
love
in
his
eyes
the
view
before
them
was
beautiful
enough
in
all
conscience
but
the
loveliness
beside
him
transcended
it
six
months
of
such
happiness
as
falls
to
few
mortals
had
done
wonders
for
leslie
it
had
brought
back
the
color
to
her
face
the
light
to
her
eyes
the
music
of
youth
joy
and
love
ecstasy
to
her
voice
it
was
the
leslie
of
portmaris
with
something
added
a
something
too
delicately
intangible
for
words
but
the
charm
of
which
all
felt
who
met
and
talked
with
her
if
it
was
possible
yorke
had
grown
to
love
her
with
a
deeper
and
more
passionate
love
since
their
marriage
and
his
pride
in
her
beauty
had
verged
on
the
ridiculous
and
sometimes
leslie
made
to
blush
under
his
gaze
would
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
the
intensity
of
his
love
almost
frightened
her
and
she
was
as
one
who
fears
for
the
safety
of
a
precious
vase
which
fate
may
overturn
or
some
malignant
wand
cast
from
its
pedestal
and
shatter
the
six
months
of
happiness
had
wrought
wonders
for
yorke
also
the
wan
and
haggard
the
hopeless
listless
expression
had
vanished
from
his
face
and
in
its
place
was
a
look
of
contentment
and
youthful
energy
which
gave
him
back
all
the
brightness
that
had
helped
to
win
heart
it
was
indeed
the
old
yorke
with
his
ready
laugh
and
jest
who
sat
beside
his
as
they
bowled
toward
their
future
home
there
you
are
he
said
presently
you
can
see
the
terrace
now
by
george
what
a
mob
it
a
regular
reception
there
be
a
speech
for
certain
do
you
think
you
are
equal
to
returning
thanks
my
lady
just
think
over
a
few
phrases
as
the
newspapers
put
it
something
neat
and
short
oh
do
yorke
she
pleaded
if
you
knew
how
my
heart
was
beating
let
me
feel
it
he
said
promptly
seizing
upon
the
excuse
no
no
sir
you
must
fleming
may
look
round
any
moment
and
she
cast
a
glance
of
mock
warning
at
that
important
individual
seated
on
the
box
but
you
may
hold
my
hand
if
you
like
is
it
trembling
and
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
piteously
though
a
soft
smile
played
upon
her
parted
lips
oh
yorke
i
feel
so
so
small
before
all
this
i
ought
to
have
been
six
feet
high
and
very
very
stately
and
instead
i
feel
so
tiny
and
insignificant
there
is
one
good
thing
i
shall
be
able
to
get
behind
you
and
hide
myself
do
you
know
that
you
have
grown
dreadfully
big
yorke
he
laughed
have
i
i
dare
say
happiness
like
laughter
makes
one
grow
fat
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
developed
into
a
kind
of
daniel
lambert
there
was
one
fat
rothbury
i
show
you
his
portrait
and
if
you
like
it
i
try
and
live
up
to
it
oh
what
lots
i
have
to
show
you
but
i
forgot
i
must
leave
that
to
dolph
the
dear
old
chap
will
love
to
trot
you
around
the
place
for
he
proud
of
it
though
he
is
always
growling
and
calling
it
a
barracks
and
an
overgrown
show
dear
old
dolph
now
oh
you
are
not
going
to
cry
no
no
leslie
responded
wiping
her
eyes
stealthily
it
it
was
only
the
sun
in
my
eyes
oh
yorke
how
good
heaven
has
been
to
us
in
every
way
think
how
sad
it
would
have
been
to
have
come
home
and
found
him
gone
from
us
yorke
nodded
with
momentary
gravity
yes
heaven
has
been
very
good
to
us
dearest
he
said
in
a
low
fervent
voice
in
that
as
in
all
things
the
horses
tore
along
as
if
they
knew
they
were
being
eagerly
waited
for
and
presently
the
sound
of
cheering
rose
and
swelled
into
a
volume
as
the
carriage
passed
under
the
arch
as
it
passed
leslie
looked
up
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
oh
look
yorke
she
cried
yorke
look
half
a
dozen
of
the
prettiest
of
the
village
stood
on
a
bower
on
top
of
the
arch
and
the
moment
the
carriage
was
underneath
they
began
to
sing
and
throw
roses
into
it
stop
stop
for
one
moment
pleaded
leslie
i
i
want
to
speak
to
them
oh
i
ca
i
ca
she
cried
you
speak
yorke
thank
them
oh
thank
them
they
could
not
stop
and
in
despair
leslie
snatched
up
one
of
the
roses
and
kissed
it
at
the
children
and
waved
her
hand
that
better
than
a
speech
said
yorke
delightedly
look
at
them
clapping
their
hands
and
hear
them
shouting
commend
me
to
lady
auchester
for
doing
the
right
thing
in
an
emergency
here
we
are
he
exclaimed
as
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
steps
and
four
grooms
ran
forward
to
the
horses
heads
and
he
got
out
and
held
his
hand
to
her
as
they
passed
up
the
steps
lined
on
either
side
by
the
servants
the
cheers
were
redoubled
mingled
with
shouts
welcome
home
my
lord
welcome
home
my
lady
at
the
top
of
the
steps
stood
the
butler
yorke
nearly
spoiled
his
short
speech
by
shaking
hands
with
him
but
the
old
fellow
stammered
it
out
and
yorke
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
looked
round
with
his
bright
smile
and
opened
his
lips
but
as
he
said
afterward
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
could
not
utter
a
word
and
even
then
he
found
himself
stammering
as
the
butler
had
done
as
he
said
thank
you
thank
you
i
should
like
to
tell
you
how
deeply
i
feel
your
kindness
but
i
ca
somehow
but
i
do
feel
it
very
much
and
so
does
my
wife
my
dear
wife
he
stopped
suddenly
and
in
the
unexpected
silence
a
voice
it
was
that
of
the
little
who
had
edged
forward
was
heard
distinctly
oh
is
she
lovely
a
proud
light
flashed
into
yorke
eyes
and
he
held
his
head
high
yes
he
said
she
is
lovely
but
she
is
something
better
than
that
she
is
good
good
one
touch
of
nature
like
this
makes
the
whole
world
kin
and
a
shout
went
up
which
echoed
and
round
the
old
walls
leslie
stood
with
blushes
but
her
hand
closed
on
her
husband
and
with
a
loving
grateful
pressure
as
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
pride
which
equaled
his
own
then
yorke
went
quickly
across
the
terrace
the
servants
drawing
back
with
true
delicacy
to
where
the
stood
and
in
another
instant
the
duke
hand
was
grasped
in
his
but
after
an
affectionate
glance
at
his
happy
face
the
duke
motioned
him
aside
and
held
out
both
hands
towards
leslie
my
welcome
comes
last
but
it
not
the
least
my
dear
he
said
leslie
stood
for
a
second
hesitating
her
color
coming
and
going
then
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
his
thin
face
flushed
and
he
held
her
a
moment
patting
her
arm
in
the
way
a
man
does
when
he
is
having
a
hard
fight
with
his
emotion
you
both
looking
very
well
young
people
he
said
but
without
removing
his
eyes
from
leslie
face
very
well
and
absurdly
happy
leslie
laughed
and
her
eyes
dwelt
on
him
with
an
expression
of
satisfaction
and
rejoicing
which
he
did
not
understand
until
she
said
and
you
oh
how
well
you
look
how
different
he
shook
his
head
with
one
of
his
quaintly
grim
smiles
yes
i
very
sorry
and
i
hope
you
both
forgive
me
for
being
so
inconsiderate
but
i
was
never
half
so
well
in
my
life
i
afraid
going
to
be
a
nuisance
and
keep
poor
yorke
waiting
for
the
title
for
a
year
or
two
all
right
dolph
said
yorke
in
his
old
breezy
voice
we
tell
you
when
we
tired
of
waiting
do
do
he
said
mind
that
a
promise
now
you
are
tired
and
you
want
to
rest
before
dinner
yorke
you
have
to
do
the
honors
of
the
house
leslie
wo
care
to
wait
while
i
limp
along
leslie
drew
his
arm
through
hers
and
looked
down
at
him
with
the
smile
which
a
sister
bestows
upon
a
beloved
and
afflicted
brother
and
with
an
added
tenderness
too
subtle
for
analysis
i
will
not
go
without
you
she
said
lean
upon
me
or
rather
i
will
lean
upon
you
for
i
am
a
little
tired
and
you
are
quite
strong
the
duke
face
flushed
with
pleasure
and
satisfaction
as
he
got
up
very
well
he
said
they
entered
the
vast
hall
and
he
pointed
out
the
great
staircase
upon
which
royalist
and
roundhead
had
fought
till
the
stairs
ran
with
blood
the
stains
were
there
still
under
the
carpet
the
old
oak
carving
the
tattered
banners
which
the
rothburys
of
old
had
borne
in
many
a
fight
for
king
and
country
the
tapestry
hangings
which
not
even
windsor
could
match
the
oriel
window
of
stained
glass
brought
piece
by
piece
from
flanders
the
long
line
of
family
portraits
then
he
took
her
through
the
state
apartments
with
their
gilded
carvings
and
priceless
furniture
grand
lofty
rooms
as
splendid
as
anything
she
had
seen
even
in
palatial
venice
to
the
library
which
a
studious
duke
had
constructed
with
infinite
care
and
pains
and
filled
with
rare
and
choice
editions
to
the
smaller
rooms
in
which
he
and
she
and
yorke
would
live
and
which
with
their
modern
decorations
and
furniture
were
the
epitome
of
elegance
and
comfort
then
they
went
up
the
great
staircase
and
along
the
broad
corridors
lined
with
pictures
and
statuary
these
are
your
rooms
he
said
opening
a
door
and
smiling
as
leslie
uttered
a
cry
of
amazement
and
delight
you
like
them
he
said
quietly
but
evidently
delighted
at
her
delight
i
glad
of
that
it
has
been
an
amusement
for
me
while
you
have
been
away
getting
them
ready
i
hope
you
find
all
you
want
but
you
must
remember
that
only
a
miserable
bachelor
and
make
allowances
if
you
miss
anything
what
shall
i
say
to
him
yorke
she
said
appealing
to
yorke
helplessly
the
duke
drew
her
on
as
if
to
escape
her
thanks
you
sha
be
bothered
with
more
rooms
now
he
said
you
shall
see
it
all
you
must
get
acquainted
with
your
own
house
you
know
as
soon
as
possible
as
he
spoke
yorke
who
had
walked
beside
them
too
moved
for
speech
stopped
before
the
half
opened
door
and
pushed
it
open
it
was
a
plainly
furnished
room
very
plainly
no
silks
or
satins
or
inlaid
furniture
here
but
an
ordinary
iron
bedstead
and
dressing
table
and
washstand
of
plain
deal
my
room
said
the
duke
simply
leslie
stopped
and
peeped
in
then
she
stood
still
surprised
and
touched
at
its
simplicity
why
have
you
given
us
all
the
beautiful
things
and
left
none
for
yourself
duke
she
said
reproachfully
he
laughed
oh
i
simple
in
my
tastes
he
said
but
i
half
thought
of
furnishing
this
room
as
a
boudoir
for
you
there
is
such
a
pretty
view
come
in
she
went
in
and
to
the
window
but
she
did
not
look
at
the
view
for
her
eye
was
caught
by
a
picture
hanging
on
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
it
was
the
picture
her
father
had
painted
and
temple
had
bought
she
looked
at
it
in
silence
and
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
then
she
turned
her
lovely
face
to
the
duke
and
tried
to
speak
all
right
my
dear
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
like
to
have
it
there
it
reminds
me
of
old
times
reminds
me
of
the
portmaris
days
when
blinded
by
my
own
conceit
i
thought
all
women
were
false
and
worthless
you
have
opened
my
eyes
my
dear
and
i
see
more
clearly
now
there
there
for
her
tears
fell
fast
that
is
all
past
now
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
face
with
a
tender
regard
and
murmured
love
took
up
the
harp
of
life
and
smote
on
all
its
chords
with
might
smote
the
chord
of
self
that
trembling
passed
in
music
out
of
sight
i
suppose
he
has
told
you
how
it
was
with
me
my
dear
leslie
eyes
dropped
for
an
instant
then
she
raised
them
and
looked
into
his
and
her
hand
closed
tightly
on
his
thin
one
well
he
said
with
a
smile
you
must
cut
your
heart
in
two
and
give
to
your
husband
and
the
other
to
your
brother

the
cup
of
happiness
six
weeks
later
when
the
world
of
fashion
was
ringing
with
the
praises
of
lady
auchester
beauty
and
amiability
and
the
society
papers
were
prophesying
that
the
future
duchess
of
rothbury
would
become
the
most
popular
of
the
leaders
of
ton
leslie
and
yorke
drove
in
a
hansom
to
john
wood
they
were
very
silent
during
the
journey
and
when
they
stopped
at
the
house
in
which
the
famous
finetta
of
the
diadem
had
held
so
many
merry
parties
leslie
got
out
of
the
cab
alone
she
was
inside
the
house
nearly
an
hour
and
when
she
came
out
with
her
veil
down
and
the
cab
she
did
not
speak
for
some
time
but
held
her
husband
hand
in
eloquent
silence
well
dearest
he
said
at
last
yes
i
am
glad
i
came
she
said
in
a
low
voice
very
glad
oh
yorke
how
changed
she
is
i
scarcely
knew
her
you
remember
how
strong
and
she
was
now
she
stopped
with
a
little
sob
and
yet
she
is
so
happy
and
cheerful
she
spends
all
her
time
thinking
and
working
for
others
the
poor
girls
at
the
theater
where
she
was
come
and
see
her
and
she
helps
them
in
all
sorts
of
ways
while
i
was
there
the
clergyman
came
in
and
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
me
outside
her
room
he
said
that
if
there
ever
was
a
really
good
woman
she
was
one
poor
fin
said
yorke
under
his
breath
no
no
said
leslie
not
pity
yorke
she
does
not
need
that
for
she
is
happier
now
lying
there
than
ever
she
was
in
the
old
days
of
her
strength
and
triumph
i
told
her
all
about
you
and
lucy
and
ralph
and
she
wants
me
to
take
lucy
to
see
her
she
and
lucy
will
just
suit
each
other
and
yorke
she
paused
and
held
out
her
tiny
fist
to
him
she
has
given
me
something
for
a
wedding
present
she
said
guess
what
it
is
i
give
it
up
he
said
quietly
she
opened
her
hand
and
showed
him
the
diamond
pendant
thought
you
would
come
some
day
she
said
yorke
and
if
you
could
have
seen
her
face
when
she
said
it
so
i
kept
it
for
you
one
day
lord
auchester
and
his
wife
and
and
ralph
duncombe
were
staying
at
a
country
house
in
the
north
it
was
an
extremely
pleasant
party
of
which
those
two
ladies
were
by
general
consent
admitted
to
be
the
belles
and
the
hostess
not
unnaturally
proud
of
having
the
famous
lady
auchester
under
her
roof
decided
to
give
a
big
dance
which
should
include
all
the
neighboring
county
families
and
their
guests
half
an
hour
before
the
opening
of
the
ball
while
leslie
was
dressing
the
hostess
lady
springmore
came
in
to
her
in
a
great
flush
of
excitement
and
distress
oh
my
dear
lady
auchester
i
am
so
sorry
she
exclaimed
when
leslie
had
sent
her
maid
away
i
am
heartbroken
about
it
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
what
is
it
lady
springmore
asked
leslie
more
amused
than
frightened
at
her
hostess
fluster
has
the
floor
fallen
in
or
the
ices
gone
wrong
no
no
my
dear
it
it
something
concerning
you
and
lord
auchester
and
she
clasped
her
hands
and
sank
into
a
chair
then
i
better
call
my
husband
said
leslie
looking
toward
the
next
where
yorke
was
brushing
his
hair
and
whistling
like
a
ploughboy
as
leslie
often
declared
no
no
and
yet
oh
i
better
tell
you
at
once
my
dear
lady
auchester
the
marlows
have
got
lady
eleanor
dallas
staying
with
them
and
she
coming
here
leslie
blushed
but
she
said
quietly
well
well
echoed
the
hostess
in
a
kind
of
despair
do
you
see
dear
she
does
know
you
are
here
and
and
oh
what
shall
i
do
do
nothing
replied
leslie
as
quietly
as
before
but
but
will
it
not
be
awkward
and
unpleasant
for
you
dear
lady
auchester
yes
said
leslie
in
her
old
downright
way
yes
it
will
be
both
awkward
and
unpleasant
but
if
we
ran
away
from
all
the
awkwardness
and
unpleasantness
in
life
we
should
spend
our
time
in
perpetual
flight
i
see
you
know
our
story
lady
springmore
oh
every
one
does
my
dear
murmured
that
lady
apologetically
just
so
said
leslie
calmly
well
if
you
are
kind
enough
to
ask
my
advice
it
is
do
nothing
the
world
is
so
small
that
lady
dallas
and
we
are
sure
to
meet
sometimes
and
well
she
smiled
do
you
think
that
we
shall
make
a
scene
in
your
pretty
ballroom
wait
she
opened
the
door
of
the
an
inch
or
two
and
called
to
yorke
hallo
he
called
back
what
is
it
want
me
to
come
and
admire
you
in
your
warpaint
i
suppose
sha
tired
of
admiring
you
oh
hush
hush
said
leslie
blushing
like
a
rose
lady
springmore
is
here
yorke
she
has
come
to
tell
us
that
that
lady
eleanor
dallas
is
coming
the
devil
no
dear
lady
eleanor
said
leslie
sweetly
and
naively
he
came
to
the
door
and
poked
his
head
round
then
he
saw
by
her
face
what
he
was
expected
to
say
and
said
it
like
a
good
and
docile
husband
delighted
to
see
any
guest
of
yours
lady
springmore
he
said
bobbing
his
head
at
her
and
promptly
disappeared
an
hour
or
two
later
when
the
ball
was
in
full
swing
leslie
heard
the
footman
announce
lady
eleanor
dallas
she
had
been
waiting
for
it
and
was
prepared
lady
eleanor
entered
she
was
thinner
and
looked
pale
and
rather
listless
and
the
air
of
pride
and
hauteur
were
more
pronounced
than
of
old
superbly
dressed
she
moved
through
the
crowd
with
a
faint
smile
of
greeting
for
her
acquaintances
then
suddenly
she
saw
leslie
she
stopped
for
just
one
instant
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
then
she
came
toward
her
and
leslie
coming
forward
too
they
met
each
other
half
way
so
to
speak
the
few
conventional
words
were
spoken
and
by
that
time
lady
eleanor
had
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
and
was
once
more
the
stately
haughty
patrician
who
suffers
and
is
silent
your
husband
is
here
lady
auchester
she
said
quite
calmly
i
will
bring
him
to
you
said
leslie
promptly
she
found
yorke
and
put
her
arm
through
his
pressing
it
to
give
him
courage
for
in
all
cases
like
this
the
bravest
man
is
as
like
as
not
to
prove
an
arrant
coward
she
is
here
yorke
now
mind
oh
lord
he
groaned
then
he
pulled
himself
together
quite
suddenly
if
she
can
go
through
it
i
can
he
said
grimly
in
another
moment
they
were
facing
each
other
yorke
with
an
unconsciously
stern
face
lady
eleanor
with
a
faint
smile
which
masked
more
than
pen
can
tell
how
do
you
do
lord
auchester
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
yorke
took
it
and
for
a
moment
he
found
that
it
trembled
but
he
said
afterwards
that
he
thought
it
was
only
fancy
then
without
another
word
she
turned
and
moved
away
they
met
they
were
bound
to
meet
often
in
the
after
years
but
it
was
never
more
than
how
do
you
do
lord
auchester
i
hope
you
are
well
lady
eleanor
until
leslie
first
girl
was
born
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
fuss
as
the
duke
said
who
made
more
fuss
than
any
one
else
over
the
birth
of
the
son
and
heir
but
this
child
the
first
girl
was
hailed
as
if
she
were
the
most
wonderful
production
the
world
had
ever
seen
and
lucy
was
regarded
with
boundless
envy
because
she
was
chosen
as
godmother
but
the
day
before
the
christening
leslie
received
a
magnificent
set
of
pearls
inclosed
in
a
box
of
white
ivory
inside
which
was
a
slip
of
paper
bearing
in
lady
eleanor
handwriting
this
inscription
to
my
godchild
leslie
eleanor
auchester
yorke
was
amazed
and
bewildered
but
leslie
understood
in
an
instant
what
does
it
mean
he
demanded
staring
at
her
and
almost
letting
the
casket
drop
it
means
that
she
is
going
to
transfer
her
love
to
our
no
your
little
one
yorke
she
said
oh
do
you
see
and
we
thought
she
hated
us
she
caught
up
her
baby
and
kissed
it
and
laughed
and
cried
over
it
in
her
joy
and
thankfulness
for
every
time
she
had
met
lady
eleanor
her
tender
heart
had
ached
but
now
this
little
mite
had
removed
the
only
thorn
in
leslie
bed
of
roses
yes
she
shall
have
her
she
said
eh
exclaimed
yorke
staring
what
altogether
i
say
oh
not
altogether
said
leslie
with
a
little
gasp
and
clutching
her
baby
tighter
no
not
altogether
but
but
nearly
oh
yorke
yorke
