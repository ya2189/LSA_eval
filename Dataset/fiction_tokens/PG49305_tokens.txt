i
a
blue
sea
some
palms
with
their
heads
bound
up
some
hedges
of
cactus
and
aloes
some
thickets
of
high
a
long
marble
terrace
shining
in
the
sun
huge
groups
of
geraniums
not
yet
a
low
white
house
with
green
shutters
and
wooden
balconies
a
châlet
roof
and
a
classical
colonnade
these
all
together
with
some
entangled
shrubberies
an
orange
orchard
and
an
olive
wood
made
up
a
place
which
was
known
on
the
french
riviera
as
la
jacquemerille
what
the
name
had
meant
originally
nobody
knew
or
everybody
had
forgotten
what
la
jacquemerille
had
been
in
the
beginning
of
time
whether
a
woman
a
plant
a
saint
a
ship
a
game
a
shrine
or
only
a
caprice
was
not
known
even
to
tradition
but
la
jacquemerille
the
villa
was
called
as
before
it
had
been
the
old
windmill
which
had
occupied
the
site
ere
steam
and
fashion
revolutionising
the
seashores
of
savoy
had
caused
the
present
pretty
nonsensical
house
to
be
erected
on
the
tongue
of
land
which
ran
sharply
out
into
the
midst
of
the
blue
waves
and
commanded
a
sea
view
west
and
east
as
far
as
the
cape
of
antibes
on
the
one
side
and
the
tête
du
chien
on
the
other
it
was
one
of
the
most
coveted
spots
on
the
whole
seaboard
of
our
modern
capua
and
brought
a
little
fortune
annually
to
its
happy
possessor
a
respectable
vendor
of
hams
cheese
and
butter
in
the
cannebière
at
marseilles
who
for
the
coming
season
had
pocketed
now
from
prince
napraxine
the
round
little
sum
of
two
thousand
napoleons
and
the
princess
nadège
napraxine
who
had
set
her
heart
or
rather
her
fancy
upon
it
was
sitting
in
a
bamboo
and
looking
over
the
house
front
and
thinking
that
decidedly
she
did
not
like
it
it
had
been
an
idiotcy
to
take
it
just
the
sort
of
folly
which
her
delegate
in
the
affair
always
committed
they
would
have
been
a
thousand
times
better
off
at
the
hotels
in
nice
you
had
no
kind
of
trouble
at
an
hotel
and
you
could
always
have
your
own
cooks
if
you
insisted
for
three
months
it
had
been
the
reigning
desire
of
her
life
to
have
la
jacquemerille
for
the
winter
it
had
been
let
to
an
american
millionnaire
and
the
apparent
impossibility
of
getting
it
had
naturally
increased
her
anxiety
the
american
millionnaire
had
suddenly
decided
to
go
home
jay
gould
or
vanderbilt
had
done
something
that
had
disturbed
his
digestion
and
la
jacquemerille
which
she
had
never
seen
but
had
fallen
in
love
with
from
photographs
was
granted
to
her
wishes
for
the
modest
sum
of
forty
thousand
francs
she
had
travelled
straight
from
the
krimea
to
it
without
stopping
had
arrived
by
night
and
now
was
looking
at
it
for
the
first
time
in
broad
daylight
with
a
sentiment
very
near
akin
to
disgust
she
did
not
find
it
the
least
like
the
photographs
is
so
horridly
low
she
exclaimed
after
a
long
and
thoughtful
examination
of
the
frontage
where
an
ionic
colonnade
sheltered
itself
under
a
châlet
roof
from
the
bernese
oberland
am
sure
it
will
be
most
dreadfully
cold
and
just
look
at
the
architecture
every
style
under
heaven
was
there
ever
such
an
extraordinary
jumble
it
be
a
jumble
my
dear
it
is
very
suitable
to
our
generation
and
you
are
very
lucky
if
when
you
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
you
get
nothing
worse
than
a
jumble
said
another
lady
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
her
with
a
book
held
upside
down
and
a
litter
of
newspapers
and
who
was
known
in
society
as
lady
brancepeth
in
a
poke
what
is
he
said
the
princess
napraxine
in
her
pretty
english
which
she
spoke
with
scarcely
any
foreign
accent
house
is
shocking
it
is
the
parthenon
mixed
up
with
a
gasthof
it
is
a
nightmare
and
so
small
i
do
believe
there
is
room
for
one
quarter
of
the
servants
and
just
look
at
these
palms
with
their
heads
tied
up
as
if
they
had
neuralgia
and
i
am
sure
they
may
well
have
it
standing
still
in
that
day
and
night
i
think
the
whole
place
utterly
odious
i
will
tell
the
women
to
unpack
nothing
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
stay
a
night
an
italian
with
a
shingle
roof
and
grindenwald
balconies
can
anything
be
so
absurd
suppose
you
will
wait
till
the
prince
comes
downstairs
said
lady
brancepeth
with
a
little
yawn
i
do
know
why
he
can
stay
if
he
likes
oh
dear
there
is
a
cairene
lattice
at
that
end
and
these
other
windows
have
been
copied
from
the
ca
and
the
roof
is
as
swiss
as
if
it
were
a
cuckoo
clock
or
a
bernard
dog
what
is
one
to
do
suggested
lady
brancepeth
do
not
die
of
a
swiss
roof
unless
it
tumbles
in
the
house
is
all
wrong
no
doubt
but
it
is
picturesque
a
horrible
word
you
will
say
but
it
describes
the
place
it
picturesque
things
usually
are
said
the
princess
napraxine
with
a
sigh
as
she
surveyed
the
greek
peristyle
the
swiss
shingles
and
the
slender
ionic
colonnade
all
these
oranges
good
for
complexion
i
wonder
it
is
like
sitting
in
a
bright
yellow
room
i
do
like
bright
yellow
rooms
who
said
that
granted
wishes
are
curses
whoever
did
must
have
wished
to
hire
la
jacquemerille
and
done
it
why
do
they
tie
up
those
palms
blanch
the
leaves
for
holy
week
every
blade
of
grass
is
turned
into
money
on
this
poetic
shore
if
the
gardens
have
been
included
in
your
agreement
you
can
untie
them
if
not
you
can
not
will
certainly
be
untied
as
for
agreement
your
brother
took
the
place
for
us
i
daresay
he
blundered
were
your
instructions
to
him
may
i
ask
instructions
i
do
not
remember
i
sent
him
the
photographs
and
wrote
under
them
take
me
the
house
at
any
price
as
cæsar
with
a
little
yawn
the
princess
napraxine
looked
down
the
long
shining
of
white
marble
studded
at
intervals
with
vases
of
white
marble
filled
with
aloes
beyond
the
marble
wall
was
the
sea
blue
bright
quivering
and
full
of
shifting
lights
as
diamonds
are
then
her
gaze
came
inward
and
returned
to
the
outline
of
the
house
which
was
so
daring
and
contradictory
a
jumble
the
creepers
which
covered
it
glowed
red
in
the
december
noon
its
blue
and
white
awnings
were
gay
and
fresh
its
vanes
were
gilded
and
pointed
merrily
to
the
south
a
late
rose
was
garlanding
the
cairene
lattice
some
woodlarks
were
singing
their
pretty
little
roundelay
on
the
boughs
of
a
carob
tree
it
was
all
bright
lively
full
of
colour
and
of
gaiety
nevertheless
she
hardened
her
heart
to
it
and
condemned
it
utterly
out
of
mere
waywardness
shall
go
away
after
breakfast
she
said
as
she
looked
can
do
as
he
likes
i
shall
dine
at
nice
and
you
will
come
with
me
was
sure
that
was
what
you
would
do
said
her
friend
was
ralph
i
shall
not
do
it
said
princess
napraxine
she
rocked
herself
soothingly
in
her
chair
a
dear
little
bird
that
is
singing
it
can
not
be
a
nightingale
in
december
the
sea
looks
very
much
like
our
krimean
one
and
what
a
lovely
air
it
is
like
an
english
june
without
the
till
madame
la
bise
comes
round
madame
la
bise
comes
round
the
corner
everywhere
she
is
like
ennui
ubiquitous
you
have
her
in
england
only
you
pretend
she
is
good
for
your
health
and
your
kingsley
wrote
an
ode
to
her
the
rest
of
the
world
is
not
such
a
hypocrite
he
was
was
he
not
are
really
wilkes
you
know
nothing
of
your
own
literature
i
was
never
educated
as
you
clever
russians
are
said
lady
brancepeth
she
was
sometimes
called
socrates
and
generally
wilkes
by
her
intimates
she
was
the
ugly
member
of
a
singularly
handsome
family
and
the
nickname
had
been
given
to
her
in
the
schoolroom
but
her
ugliness
was
a
her
face
was
charming
in
its
own
way
her
eyes
were
brilliant
and
her
figure
was
matchless
she
was
an
earl
daughter
and
an
earl
wife
and
when
she
put
on
the
brancepeth
diamonds
and
showed
herself
at
a
state
ball
if
ugly
she
was
magnificent
even
as
if
intellectually
ignorant
she
was
a
marvel
of
tact
humour
and
discernment
her
friend
and
hostess
was
as
entirely
unlike
her
as
an
orchid
is
unlike
an
aloe
she
was
exquisitely
lovely
alike
in
face
and
form
and
as
cultured
as
a
hothouse
flower
she
was
just
years
old
and
was
a
woman
of
the
world
to
her
finger
tips
she
was
very
cosmopolitan
for
though
a
russian
by
birth
and
marriage
her
mother
had
been
french
one
of
her
grandmothers
english
the
other
german
and
she
had
been
educated
by
a
crowd
of
governesses
of
many
different
nationalities
all
her
people
whether
russian
english
french
or
german
had
been
very
great
people
with
innumerable
and
unimpeachable
quarterings
for
many
generations
and
to
that
fact
she
owed
her
slender
feet
her
tiny
ears
and
her
general
look
of
perfect
distinction
she
had
a
transparent
colourless
skin
like
the
petals
of
a
narcissus
in
its
perfect
whiteness
she
had
oriental
eyes
of
a
which
looked
immensely
large
in
her
delicate
face
and
which
could
have
great
inquisitiveness
penetration
and
sarcasm
in
them
but
were
usually
only
lustrous
and
languid
her
mouth
was
most
admirably
shaped
and
her
teeth
deserved
the
trite
compliment
of
the
old
madrigals
for
they
were
like
pearls
she
had
a
very
ethereal
and
delicate
appearance
but
that
delicacy
of
mould
sheathed
nerves
of
steel
as
a
silken
scabbard
sheathes
a
damascene
blade
she
had
an
infinite
grace
and
an
intricate
alternation
of
vivacity
and
languor
which
were
irresistible
men
were
madly
in
love
with
her
which
sometimes
diverted
and
sometimes
bored
her
many
people
were
rather
afraid
of
her
and
this
pleased
her
much
more
than
anything
she
had
a
capacity
for
malice
she
now
held
a
sunshade
above
her
head
and
surveyed
the
house
and
tried
to
persuade
herself
it
was
charming
as
her
friend
had
been
so
sure
she
would
find
it
detestable
she
had
wished
for
the
place
with
an
intensity
that
had
almost
disturbed
her
sleep
for
some
weeks
and
now
she
had
got
it
and
she
hated
it
but
as
they
had
expected
her
to
do
so
she
was
determined
to
conquer
her
hatred
and
to
find
it
much
better
than
its
photographs
the
task
was
not
difficult
for
la
jacquemerille
if
full
of
absurdities
and
incongruities
was
decidedly
pretty
as
she
swung
herself
on
her
and
began
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
her
mind
a
hundred
improvements
which
she
would
instantly
have
effected
whether
the
terms
of
the
contract
allowed
of
it
or
not
she
saw
coming
within
the
range
of
her
unassisted
eyesight
a
large
and
stately
schooner
with
canvas
white
as
snow
bellying
in
the
breeze
she
drew
on
her
long
loose
glove
cheerfully
and
said
aloud
all
it
is
better
than
an
hotel
there
is
no
noise
and
nobody
to
stare
at
one
i
daresay
we
shall
get
through
three
months
without
cutting
each
other
throats
lady
brancepeth
turned
and
looked
out
to
sea
and
saw
the
schooner
and
smiled
discreetly
she
said
as
discreetly
am
so
glad
dear
you
wo
fret
yourself
too
much
about
the
place
after
all
you
are
not
going
to
live
in
it
for
a
lifetime
and
though
no
doubt
it
is
utterly
wrong
and
would
give
oscar
wilde
a
sick
headache
yet
one
must
confess
it
is
pretty
and
suits
the
sunshine
the
trees
had
been
cut
so
that
openings
in
their
boughs
allowed
the
sea
to
be
seen
from
any
point
of
the
terrace
princess
nadine
from
under
her
sunshade
watched
the
stately
yacht
draw
nearer
and
nearer
over
the
shining
path
of
the
waters
and
drop
anchor
some
half
mile
off
the
shore
then
she
saw
a
gig
lowered
with
sailors
to
man
it
and
a
figure
which
she
recognised
descended
over
the
schooner
side
into
the
stern
of
the
boat
which
thereupon
left
the
vessel
and
was
pulled
straight
towards
la
jacquemerille
neither
she
nor
lady
brancepeth
appeared
to
notice
it
they
talked
and
read
their
newspapers
but
the
long
boat
came
nearer
and
nearer
until
the
beat
of
the
oars
sounded
directly
under
the
walls
of
la
jacquemerille
and
the
rowers
were
too
close
at
hand
to
be
seen
but
the
princess
nadine
heard
the
rattle
of
the
oars
in
the
rowlocks
the
shock
of
its
keel
against
the
sea
stairs
below
which
she
could
not
see
for
the
tangle
of
pyracanthus
and
mahonia
and
many
another
evergreen
shrub
covering
the
space
between
the
terrace
and
the
shore
she
heard
a
step
that
she
knew
very
well
the
sound
of
which
moved
her
to
a
slight
sense
of
anticipated
amusement
and
a
stronger
sense
of
approaching
weariness
and
she
turned
her
head
a
little
with
a
gracious
if
indifferent
welcome
in
her
eyes
as
a
man
ran
up
the
stairs
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
and
came
along
the
marble
floor
in
the
sunshine
a
young
man
tall
fair
athletic
with
a
look
and
handsome
aquiline
features
have
had
a
very
quick
run
surely
said
the
princess
napraxine
stretching
out
her
tan
glove
we
did
all
we
knew
and
crammed
on
every
stitch
we
had
the
new
comer
answered
as
he
kissed
the
tips
of
the
glove
and
murmured
in
a
lower
tone
you
not
here
then
he
crossed
over
to
where
lady
brancepeth
sat
and
kissed
her
cheek
with
a
brother
indifference
wilkes
are
you
all
right
he
said
as
he
took
up
a
majolica
stool
and
seated
himself
between
them
that
bamboo
chair
geraldine
asked
the
princess
china
stool
does
not
suit
your
long
legs
at
all
how
many
hours
really
have
you
been
coming
from
genoa
i
am
fearfully
angry
with
you
by
the
way
how
could
you
take
this
place
you
told
me
answered
lord
geraldine
staring
hard
was
the
command
take
it
que
not
an
if
not
a
perhaps
not
a
but
wilkes
do
you
not
call
that
too
cruel
dear
ralph
said
lady
brancepeth
woman
instructions
should
always
be
construed
so
liberally
that
a
margin
is
left
for
her
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
change
her
mind
but
do
not
distress
yourself
i
do
not
think
mme
napraxine
really
dislikes
the
place
it
is
only
her
way
when
she
has
bought
a
thing
she
always
finds
a
flaw
in
it
it
is
her
habit
to
condemn
everything
she
is
a
pessimist
from
sheer
want
of
ever
having
had
real
disappointment
at
the
house
it
speaks
for
itself
said
the
princess
contemptuously
did
you
not
telegraph
and
say
that
it
was
a
patchwork
of
every
known
order
of
architecture
i
would
have
told
you
to
break
off
negotiations
you
had
seen
the
photographs
would
you
know
your
own
mother
from
a
photograph
if
you
had
not
been
told
beforehand
whose
it
was
am
so
sorry
murmured
geraldine
as
he
turned
round
and
gazed
at
the
offending
building
is
a
pretty
place
surely
not
classical
or
severe
certainly
but
cheery
and
picturesque
i
looked
all
over
it
conscientiously
i
give
you
my
word
and
it
is
really
in
very
good
taste
inside
much
better
than
one
could
have
hoped
for
in
a
it
is
wilkes
not
i
who
finds
it
so
irretrievably
bad
said
the
princess
napraxine
with
tranquil
mendacity
if
it
be
too
bad
one
can
always
go
to
an
hotel
only
in
an
hotel
one
can
never
sleep
at
night
for
the
omnibuses
and
the
banging
of
other
people
luggage
and
if
i
do
not
sleep
i
can
do
nothing
here
i
should
fancy
it
is
perfectly
quiet
as
the
grave
unless
the
sea
is
howling
but
monte
carlo
is
just
behind
that
cliff
there
with
fast
horses
you
can
drive
over
in
minutes
i
timed
it
by
my
watch
you
can
have
a
score
of
people
to
dinner
every
evening
if
you
like
the
princess
raised
her
eyebrows
with
a
gesture
signifying
that
this
prospect
was
not
one
of
unmitigated
happiness
and
lady
brancepeth
alleging
that
the
sun
was
rather
too
warm
for
her
bones
went
away
into
the
house
being
of
opinion
that
three
was
no
company
her
brother
drew
his
nearer
his
hostess
and
took
the
tan
glove
with
the
wrist
it
inclosed
in
a
tender
grasp
you
do
not
like
the
poor
place
i
am
truly
grieved
she
drew
her
hand
away
so
dexterously
that
she
left
the
loose
empty
glove
in
his
fingers
and
he
looked
foolish
i
thought
of
going
away
she
continued
without
any
regard
to
his
dejection
do
not
like
palms
that
have
the
toothache
and
marble
pillars
that
have
married
wooden
balconies
but
your
sister
who
always
opposes
me
is
so
certain
i
shall
go
that
it
is
very
probable
i
shall
stop
feminine
logic
no
doubt
the
poor
house
is
utterly
wrong
though
it
has
been
the
desire
of
everybody
on
the
riviera
ever
since
it
was
built
i
felt
sure
you
would
have
been
more
comfortable
in
a
good
hotel
at
nice
and
if
i
had
ventured
to
volunteer
an
opinion
i
should
have
said
so
wilkes
is
quite
right
you
will
be
bored
to
death
here
is
quite
wrong
she
does
not
like
the
place
herself
said
princess
napraxine
with
decision
while
she
took
back
her
glove
peremptorily
do
at
least
in
a
way
the
oranges
look
jaundiced
and
the
palms
rheumatic
but
those
are
trifles
they
do
say
it
hailed
yesterday
and
the
water
in
the
in
the
was
frozen
last
night
as
we
came
into
ventimiglia
but
i
saw
a
scorpion
on
the
wall
this
morning
and
heard
a
mosquito
so
i
am
convinced
it
is
the
south
of
the
poets
and
am
prepared
for
any
quantity
of
proper
impressions
only
they
are
slow
in
coming
to
me
it
is
so
excessively
like
the
krimea
terrace
and
all
should
not
you
go
in
and
see
if
platon
be
awake
am
convinced
he
is
asleep
it
is
not
quite
one
and
you
arrived
in
the
night
did
you
but
he
will
get
up
because
he
will
want
to
be
off
to
monte
carlo
he
will
spend
his
life
there
and
send
over
expresses
every
hour
for
fresh
rouleaux
when
he
is
near
a
he
is
so
happy
faculty
is
my
faculty
too
but
i
try
against
it
he
does
men
never
try
to
resist
anything
geraldine
murmured
words
to
the
effect
that
his
life
was
one
long
compulsory
resistance
and
his
eyes
completed
the
uncomplete
sentences
talk
nonsense
said
his
hostess
know
i
do
not
like
and
an
englishman
always
looks
so
clumsy
when
he
is
making
them
make
me
a
cigarette
instead
cruel
murmured
her
companion
obediently
rolling
up
turkish
tobacco
kind
said
the
princess
who
are
kind
to
men
and
children
never
spoil
them
where
will
your
schooner
stay
there
is
no
dock
or
quay
or
whatever
you
call
it
here
these
places
always
ought
to
have
one
of
their
own
can
they
when
the
rocks
go
sheer
down
into
deep
water
no
i
must
keep
her
off
villefranche
or
monaco
she
can
be
round
in
half
an
hour
at
your
disposition
of
course
like
her
owner
she
be
not
more
manageable
than
her
owner
nadine
when
i
only
live
to
obey
your
orders
and
never
even
receive
a
smile
in
return
if
you
want
reward
there
is
no
longer
any
merit
and
do
not
call
me
by
my
name
in
that
manner
you
will
do
it
some
day
before
platon
does
mind
of
course
he
does
not
mind
but
i
do
which
is
more
to
the
purpose
are
very
unkind
princess
this
unhappy
jacquemerille
it
is
grievous
that
you
do
like
it
the
gardens
are
really
pretty
and
the
view
is
superb
talk
like
an
auctioneer
go
and
find
the
gardener
and
tell
him
to
untie
those
palms
do
send
me
away
yet
that
what
you
call
your
docility
his
hand
stole
towards
hers
again
tell
me
princess
he
murmured
timidly
will
stay
now
that
you
are
here
will
you
not
can
i
answer
for
the
duration
of
my
fancies
perhaps
i
may
if
you
amuse
me
well
enough
would
rather
interest
you
my
friend
that
is
quite
impossible
even
to
be
amused
is
hard
enough
when
one
is
not
in
the
humour
when
one
is
in
the
humour
it
is
even
fun
to
go
out
fishing
when
one
is
not
one
is
dull
even
at
a
masked
ball
at
petersburg
we
are
like
the
we
make
our
sphere
muddy
with
our
own
dulness
how
would
you
suggest
that
i
should
find
any
interest
here
there
will
be
no
society
except
some
gouty
statesmen
and
some
sickly
women
a
few
yachtsmen
a
or
two
and
quantities
of
people
one
can
not
know
will
be
heaps
of
people
who
know
you
said
geraldine
almost
with
a
groan
least
if
you
deign
to
allow
them
the
of
la
jacquemerille
if
i
might
presume
to
advise
the
place
is
all
to
itself
they
can
not
come
if
you
do
not
invite
them
it
is
as
nearly
simple
nature
here
as
a
and
an
like
you
can
ever
bring
herself
to
go
you
have
the
sea
at
your
feet
and
the
mountains
at
your
back
you
can
have
absolute
repose
and
leisure
unless
you
wilfully
bring
a
horde
of
men
and
women
from
nice
and
monaco
you
are
so
clever
you
might
make
endless
sketches
if
i
were
you
i
should
make
it
the
occasion
to
get
away
from
the
world
a
little
if
the
world
you
must
have
i
should
take
it
in
the
avenue
josephine
instead
of
at
la
jacquemerille
the
princess
laughed
languidly
and
looked
at
her
cigarette
want
a
solitude
i
daresay
but
you
see
there
are
platon
and
wilkes
against
that
not
to
mention
my
own
inclinations
be
serious
when
one
is
in
the
mood
to
be
serious
one
does
not
take
a
nondescript
toy
within
five
miles
of
nice
i
daresay
you
are
right
a
quiet
life
for
a
little
while
would
be
very
wholesome
it
would
certainly
be
a
novelty
but
it
would
be
beyond
me
i
am
not
a
stupid
woman
i
am
not
a
silly
woman
certainly
no
i
am
quite
convinced
i
have
a
brain
though
as
for
a
soul
i
do
know
and
i
am
afraid
i
do
very
much
care
a
brain
however
i
have
wilkes
is
even
unkind
enough
to
call
me
learned
but
still
my
dear
ralph
i
am
as
you
observed
that
animal
a
when
once
we
belong
to
the
world
can
we
ever
get
rid
of
the
world
au
grand
jamais
if
we
try
to
drink
spring
water
we
put
it
somehow
or
other
in
a
liqueur
glass
if
we
smell
at
a
somehow
or
other
piver
has
got
in
it
before
us
and
given
it
the
scent
of
a
sachet
are
very
witty
but
do
care
in
the
least
for
buts
and
i
have
no
pretensions
to
wit
i
leave
wit
and
whist
to
the
dowagers
no
when
we
are
once
of
the
world
worldly
we
never
get
rid
of
the
world
again
it
is
our
old
man
of
the
sea
pickaback
with
us
for
ever
who
can
lead
a
meditative
life
that
dines
twice
a
day
as
we
all
practically
do
and
eats
of
twenty
services
when
we
prattle
about
nature
and
quote
matthew
arnold
we
are
as
artificial
as
the
ribboned
shepherdesses
of
trianon
and
what
we
call
our
high
art
is
only
just
another
sort
of
jargon
suppose
i
followed
your
recipe
and
tried
living
quietly
here
which
means
asking
nobody
to
dinner
what
would
happen
wilkes
would
go
away
platon
would
sulk
or
do
worse
and
you
and
i
should
yawn
in
each
other
faces
it
is
not
that
i
have
no
brain
i
have
even
a
soul
if
anybody
has
but
i
began
the
other
way
you
know
it
is
like
taking
chloral
if
once
you
do
it
you
can
not
leave
off
society
is
entirely
like
chloral
it
gives
you
pleasant
titillations
at
first
and
just
the
same
depression
afterwards
and
yet
you
can
not
do
without
it
hope
you
do
without
chloral
wait
another
twenty
years
at
any
rate
before
you
poison
yourself
years
i
wonder
what
we
shall
be
like
by
then
i
daresay
i
shall
be
an
incurable
hypochondriac
and
you
will
have
several
tall
boys
at
eton
perhaps
your
son
will
be
falling
in
love
with
my
daughter
and
you
and
i
shall
be
quarrelling
about
the
settlements
he
drew
his
chair
very
near
indeed
and
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
the
princess
looked
up
at
the
blue
sky
serenely
indifferent
is
all
nonsense
you
know
she
said
with
a
little
affected
asperity
but
she
smiled
even
if
she
felt
more
inclined
to
yawn
at
that
moment
there
issued
from
one
of
the
many
glass
doors
of
the
nondescript
house
her
husband
platon
nicholaivitch
napraxine
dear
ralph
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
he
said
cordially
in
the
tongue
of
the
boulevards
which
every
gently
born
russian
has
taken
as
his
own
came
round
in
your
tub
as
you
call
her
you
have
found
the
princess
dissatisfied
with
the
house
she
is
always
dissatisfied
with
everything
alas
the
house
is
well
enough
the
bathrooms
are
small
and
there
is
no
but
otherwise
i
see
no
defect
breakfast
is
waiting
and
lady
brancepeth
also
will
you
come
his
wife
rose
languidly
and
taking
the
arm
of
lord
geraldine
drew
her
skirts
of
india
muslin
flemish
lace
and
primrose
satin
over
the
marble
pavement
of
the
terrace
to
the
house
prince
napraxine
stood
a
moment
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
looking
south
and
east
over
the
sparkling
sea
then
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
sauntered
also
towards
the
house
he
was
a
tall
man
with
an
ugly
and
frankly
kalmuck
face
redeemed
by
an
expression
of
extreme
good
humour
he
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
and
had
the
air
of
a
person
who
had
always
done
what
he
chose
and
had
always
been
obeyed
when
he
spoke
but
this
air
changed
curiously
whenever
he
looked
at
his
wife
he
had
then
the
timid
and
almost
supplicating
expression
of
a
big
dog
anxious
to
please
but
afraid
to
offend
us
go
and
eat
milo
red
mullets
she
said
now
is
that
the
cook
can
he
do
a
i
wonder
he
replied
their
had
been
taken
ill
as
the
train
had
touched
bordighera
and
their
agent
had
hastily
supplied
his
place
so
far
as
it
is
ever
possible
to
supply
that
of
a
great
and
almost
perfect
creature
experienced
in
all
the
peculiarities
and
caprices
in
taste
of
those
to
whom
his
art
is
consecrated
the
princess
took
no
notice
of
her
lord
blunder
indeed
she
seldom
answered
his
remarks
at
any
time
she
drew
her
primrose
satin
and
soft
muslin
over
the
sill
of
the
french
window
and
seated
herself
at
an
oval
table
gay
with
fine
china
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
with
a
venice
point
lace
border
to
its
table
cloth
which
was
strewn
with
parma
violets
and
the
petals
of
she
had
geraldine
on
her
right
hand
and
her
back
to
the
light
she
had
an
ermine
bag
holding
a
silver
globe
of
warm
water
for
her
feet
and
a
chair
that
was
the
perfection
of
ease
the
was
small
but
very
pretty
with
game
and
autumn
flowers
painted
on
its
panels
and
shutters
with
hangings
of
olive
velvet
and
cornices
of
dead
gold
and
on
the
ceiling
a
hunting
scene
of
fontainebleau
henri
iv
she
began
to
think
seriously
that
after
all
la
jacquemerille
would
do
very
well
for
the
winter
it
was
utterly
absurd
to
be
sure
outside
but
it
was
comfortable
within
and
indeed
had
considerable
taste
displayed
in
it
the
american
having
wisely
mistrusted
his
own
tendencies
and
left
the
whole
arrangement
to
french
artists
who
had
robbed
him
ruthlessly
but
who
had
made
each
of
his
apartments
as
perfect
in
its
way
as
a
karl
theodor
plate
think
i
shall
buy
it
said
the
princess
to
her
companions
indifferent
to
her
own
inconsistencies
a
little
said
lady
brancepeth
rush
from
hatred
to
adoration
there
may
be
all
sorts
of
things
the
matter
with
the
drains
the
may
be
wrong
the
cellars
may
be
damp
the
windows
may
rattle
the
kitchens
may
be
too
far
or
too
near
at
the
end
of
the
winter
you
will
know
all
its
defects
and
all
its
virtues
houses
are
like
friendships
there
is
hardly
one
in
a
thousand
worth
a
long
lease
is
always
cynical
said
her
brother
nobody
is
a
stauncher
friend
said
the
princess
will
she
make
herself
out
a
cynic
cynic
because
i
am
prudent
said
lady
brancepeth
you
sigh
all
the
winter
because
the
house
is
not
yours
you
will
enjoy
it
if
you
buy
it
you
will
discover
that
it
is
uninhabitable
at
once
is
never
long
pleased
said
her
husband
does
matthew
arnold
say
answered
the
princess
the
poet
is
never
happy
because
in
nature
he
wants
the
world
and
in
the
world
he
longs
for
nature
now
i
am
not
a
poet
but
still
i
am
a
little
like
that
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
my
discontent
is
a
certain
restless
sensation
that
our
life
which
we
think
the
only
life
is
a
very
ridiculous
one
and
yet
i
am
quite
incapable
of
leading
any
other
for
more
than
a
week
i
remember
geraldine
that
you
remarked
once
that
it
was
this
fool
of
a
world
which
makes
fools
of
us
all
there
was
a
profound
truth
in
the
not
very
elegant
speech
do
remember
saying
it
but
it
is
certainly
true
we
grow
up
in
the
world
as
a
chinese
child
grows
up
in
the
jar
which
is
to
make
a
dwarf
of
him
the
jar
checks
our
development
we
can
not
be
giants
if
we
would
am
sure
it
would
not
suit
you
to
be
a
giant
ralph
said
his
sister
would
never
like
to
release
distressed
damsels
and
slay
disagreeable
dragons
the
uttermost
you
would
ever
do
to
the
very
biggest
dragon
would
be
to
turn
an
epigram
on
his
odd
appearance
giants
are
always
very
busy
people
and
you
are
so
lazy
is
the
fault
of
the
jar
said
geraldine
people
break
the
jar
and
get
out
of
it
said
his
sister
nobody
does
said
the
princess
napraxine
mistake
there
wilkes
the
world
is
with
us
always
and
we
can
not
get
rid
of
it
the
frank
eyes
of
geraldine
conveyed
to
her
eloquently
his
conviction
that
the
discontent
she
spoke
of
was
solely
due
to
her
determined
banishment
of
one
sentiment
out
of
her
life
she
gave
him
an
enigmatical
little
smile
of
comprehension
and
disbelief
combined
and
continued
to
unroll
her
philosophies
or
what
did
duty
as
such
you
not
know
the
kind
of
feeling
i
mean
when
we
are
among
the
orchids
in
the
conservatories
we
want
to
go
and
gather
damp
primroses
do
you
not
remember
that
queen
who
when
she
heard
the
gipsies
singing
under
her
windows
all
in
a
moment
longed
to
go
with
them
there
is
something
of
the
gipsy
in
everybody
in
everybody
who
has
a
soul
the
time
comes
when
one
is
tired
of
the
trumpery
and
folly
of
it
all
the
wicked
expenditure
the
dense
selfishness
and
indifference
the
people
that
call
themselves
leaders
of
good
taste
and
yet
like
and
the
and
and
and
the
atmosphere
of
paris
theatres
but
discursive
murmured
lady
brancepeth
gipsies
a
soul
i
do
not
see
the
connection
know
what
i
mean
said
her
hostess
who
always
expected
to
be
understood
life
is
silly
it
is
tiresome
it
is
entirely
selfish
it
is
even
in
a
way
monstrous
and
yet
we
can
not
live
any
other
we
are
dominated
by
the
frankenstein
of
pleasure
which
we
have
been
pleased
to
create
when
we
wish
to
get
away
we
can
not
we
are
like
the
queen
at
the
palace
windows
we
would
fain
go
to
the
greenwood
and
the
brook
and
the
fresh
winds
but
we
can
not
because
we
are
fastened
in
our
gilded
chair
there
is
always
our
household
to
shut
the
window
and
send
the
gipsies
away
do
we
ever
get
rid
of
the
household
of
the
of
the
routine
of
the
infinite
ennui
i
am
only
years
old
as
you
all
know
and
i
feel
as
if
i
had
lived
fifty
years
why
because
it
is
all
tiresome
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
could
lead
no
other
life
if
i
tried
am
not
sure
of
that
said
lady
brancepeth
antoinette
would
never
have
believed
that
she
could
mend
clothes
and
darn
stockings
had
not
the
days
of
darkness
come
in
those
days
it
was
just
the
dainty
perfumed
like
you
my
dear
who
were
the
bravest
and
handiest
in
bearing
their
troubles
and
earning
their
bread
never
knows
till
one
is
tried
said
princess
nadine
they
would
begin
to
guillotine
us
i
daresay
we
should
know
how
to
behave
dynamite
does
do
much
for
us
when
one
goes
into
the
air
without
warning
in
little
bits
in
company
with
the
plaster
of
the
ceiling
or
the
skin
of
the
carriage
horses
or
the
stuffing
of
the
railway
carriage
there
is
not
much
room
for
heroism
am
not
sure
there
is
no
heroism
said
geraldine
certainty
of
the
guillotine
must
have
been
much
easier
to
bear
than
the
uncertainty
in
which
you
all
dwell
in
russia
the
perpetual
spectre
always
behind
your
chairs
beside
your
pillows
under
the
roses
in
your
gardens
my
dear
geraldine
is
not
death
with
us
always
everywhere
may
we
not
kill
ourselves
every
moment
we
walk
downstairs
or
eat
a
mullet
like
this
or
start
on
a
journey
or
read
a
book
by
a
you
all
wonder
how
russians
can
exist
with
assassination
always
keeping
step
with
them
but
in
reality
is
it
so
much
worse
than
the
way
in
which
all
humanity
loves
and
laughs
and
toils
and
moils
and
makes
leases
for
years
and
contracts
foreign
loans
for
payment
in
a
century
with
death
hanging
over
the
whole
thing
ready
to
swoop
down
at
any
minute
if
the
world
realised
it
of
course
it
would
go
mad
but
it
does
realise
it
though
hundreds
of
people
die
every
second
nadine
ever
tell
you
what
she
did
last
year
said
prince
napraxine
saw
by
chance
a
can
which
had
been
placed
by
some
of
those
miscreants
in
a
niche
of
the
garden
wall
of
our
house
in
petersburg
the
thing
looked
suspicious
to
her
and
it
had
a
coil
of
tubing
attached
to
it
she
took
the
whole
affair
up
and
dropped
it
into
the
fountain
she
forgot
to
mention
it
till
the
next
morning
then
when
we
fished
it
out
and
the
chemists
reported
on
it
it
appeared
that
the
can
was
really
full
of
as
she
had
fancied
i
think
that
was
quite
as
courageous
as
going
to
the
guillotine
no
my
dear
platon
said
his
wife
with
some
annoyance
you
have
no
time
to
think
about
is
really
courageous
the
can
was
suspicious
and
the
children
were
playing
near
it
so
i
thought
the
fountain
was
the
safest
place
it
have
been
only
milk
you
know
pray
do
not
let
us
attempt
to
compete
with
those
people
of
we
shall
fail
dismally
geraldine
looked
up
with
a
startled
apprehension
in
his
eyes
heavens
do
you
mean
it
has
she
actually
been
been
in
such
awful
danger
as
that
and
never
told
me
were
all
in
the
same
danger
said
prince
napraxine
a
little
drily
the
princess
alone
had
the
out
of
it
put
the
can
there
how
should
i
know
the
police
never
traced
it
i
do
not
suppose
it
was
any
special
design
against
us
as
individuals
only
as
items
of
a
detested
whole
and
two
of
the
grand
dukes
were
coming
to
breakfast
with
us
that
day
a
fuss
about
an
ugly
little
tin
can
said
his
wife
really
courageous
person
must
have
been
the
person
who
brought
it
there
misguided
perhaps
but
certainly
courageous
to
drive
through
a
city
in
a
droschky
embracing
certain
annihilation
in
the
form
of
a
little
tin
pot
held
on
your
knee
is
a
combination
of
absolute
awfulness
and
grotesque
bathos
which
must
try
all
one
nerves
without
any
compensating
sense
of
grandeur
in
it
a
jolt
of
the
wheel
over
a
stone
and
away
you
fly
into
the
air
a
blurred
nothing
in
a
stream
of
blood
and
dust
no
i
respect
the
nihilists
when
i
think
of
all
they
risk
for
a
purely
abstract
idea
without
any
sort
of
personal
hope
or
triumph
have
hatred
said
lady
brancepeth
think
you
forget
what
an
invigorating
sentiment
that
is
its
ecstasy
is
its
own
reward
you
underrate
too
the
immense
fascination
of
the
power
to
destroy
se
with
that
sense
of
holding
the
annihilation
of
a
whole
community
in
their
hands
what
made
the
roman
emperors
mad
the
unlimited
power
of
destruction
now
intoxicates
the
mechanic
or
the
clerk
who
has
the
task
of
planting
a
can
of
when
statesmen
and
even
philosophers
theorise
about
human
nature
and
all
its
disorders
they
never
give
weight
enough
to
the
tremendous
attraction
which
pure
destruction
alone
exercises
over
so
many
minds
they
have
love
too
love
of
the
poor
and
of
a
lofty
ideal
said
the
princess
i
forgive
their
little
tin
cans
though
they
are
extremely
unpleasant
when
i
think
of
their
impersonal
devotion
all
i
wish
is
that
their
warfare
was
not
conducted
by
tin
cans
the
thing
has
a
ludicrous
comical
vulgar
side
death
dropped
in
a
little
box
labelled
glass
with
care
there
is
no
dignity
in
it
no
grace
pallida
mors
should
not
crouch
under
a
can
you
make
a
jest
began
prince
napraxine
she
interrupted
him
am
not
in
the
least
jesting
i
am
entirely
in
earnest
i
do
not
like
being
made
war
on
by
chemists
i
do
not
like
annihilation
left
in
a
paper
parcel
it
makes
one
feel
absurd
fate
seems
trifling
with
one
a
jacquerie
hewing
at
one
with
their
scythes
one
would
know
what
to
do
with
but
who
can
extract
any
sophoclean
tragedy
from
a
thanatus
that
looks
exactly
like
a
box
of
sardines
or
a
pot
of
it
is
not
the
war
that
i
object
to
it
is
the
form
it
takes
and
our
great
grim
ghostly
russia
should
evolve
out
of
her
soul
of
ice
something
much
more
in
consonance
with
her
beside
the
burning
of
moscow
the
little
tin
cans
and
the
burrowing
like
moles
underground
are
commonplace
and
a
little
vulgar
russia
is
so
awful
in
herself
one
thinks
of
the
frozen
world
of
the
inferno
and
dante
and
virgil
walking
in
the
spectral
silence
and
then
after
all
in
hard
fact
there
is
nothing
but
the
police
and
the
drunken
moujik
and
the
man
who
carries
his
as
a
baker
boy
carries
his
rolls
of
bread
it
is
bathos
never
knows
what
you
mean
nadine
murmured
her
husband
you
talk
so
at
petersburg
they
will
think
you
are
a
nihilist
at
heart
imagine
half
the
are
said
the
princess
have
always
dug
their
own
graves
before
all
revolutions
everywhere
they
call
it
going
with
the
times
they
did
it
in
france
they
are
now
doing
it
in
england
they
are
doing
it
more
secretly
in
russia
no
one
should
forsake
their
order
it
is
a
kind
of
desertion
like
that
of
a
soldier
who
runs
away
before
the
enemy
that
is
why
i
like
the
party
obedience
of
your
country
wilkes
it
is
entirely
unintelligent
and
profoundly
immoral
to
a
generally
intellectual
nation
it
would
be
impossible
but
it
is
loyal
i
think
when
one
has
to
choose
between
a
crime
and
a
disloyalty
one
must
take
the
crime
as
the
lesser
evil
of
the
two
for
party
is
a
crime
very
often
said
geraldine
is
one
of
the
many
things
as
to
which
i
have
never
made
up
my
mind
ought
one
to
sacrifice
the
country
to
what
one
believes
a
bad
measure
for
the
sheer
sake
of
keeping
one
party
in
office
surely
not
solve
your
doubts
by
having
no
party
and
never
going
into
the
lords
least
i
can
do
no
mischief
you
certain
of
that
said
his
sister
think
you
place
voting
for
party
on
too
low
a
plane
if
we
believe
generally
that
one
party
say
it
is
conservative
say
it
is
liberal
is
necessary
to
the
preservation
or
the
progress
of
the
nation
then
i
think
we
are
bound
to
do
our
best
to
keep
it
at
the
helm
of
the
vessel
of
the
nation
even
if
in
certain
minor
matters
we
are
not
always
in
accord
with
the
course
it
takes
reasoned
but
are
not
politicians
always
as
great
sophists
as
priests
always
that
cruel
charge
said
a
mellow
and
manly
voice
as
there
entered
the
a
person
of
handsome
and
stately
presence
in
a
picturesque
costume
with
knee
breeches
and
buckled
shoes
whom
the
servant
announced
as
monsignore
melville
he
was
welcomed
by
all
with
cordiality
and
delight
and
the
princess
bade
him
draw
his
chair
beside
her
though
he
alleged
that
he
had
breakfasted
came
to
see
if
you
had
arrived
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
i
hope
la
jacquemerille
is
fortunate
enough
to
please
you
have
been
abusing
it
it
is
a
very
ridiculous
house
but
it
grows
upon
one
and
if
you
will
come
often
enough
monsignore
no
i
never
make
compliments
you
know
you
are
a
delightful
companion
and
of
how
many
people
can
one
say
that
monsignore
melville
bowed
low
are
too
enchantingly
kind
but
all
are
not
so
kind
lord
geraldine
was
accusing
priests
of
sophism
what
was
he
saying
was
saying
that
politicians
are
the
sophists
and
wilkes
the
head
of
them
i
defended
voting
straight
said
lady
brancepeth
it
not
the
very
root
and
essence
of
english
constitutional
life
monsignore
melville
who
is
an
englishman
will
i
am
sure
say
so
serve
the
church
is
only
a
superior
kind
of
voting
with
party
said
geraldine
not
be
profane
ralph
said
his
sister
does
not
suit
you
you
were
created
with
a
reverential
nature
and
you
have
endeavoured
to
ruin
it
as
most
men
always
do
try
to
destroy
what
is
best
in
them
monsignore
answer
me
is
it
not
the
highest
morality
to
vote
straight
is
a
very
unlimited
laudation
lady
brancepeth
returned
melville
with
a
charming
smile
should
be
scarcely
prepared
to
go
so
far
though
i
am
aware
that
there
is
no
salvation
outside
such
morality
in
the
political
creed
of
our
country
have
no
country
my
dear
monsignore
said
the
princess
napraxine
a
heavenly
one
what
a
comfort
that
must
be
platon
is
always
being
worried
to
return
to
the
and
his
conscience
is
so
peculiarly
constituted
that
it
will
never
allow
him
to
admit
how
intensely
he
hates
it
as
if
life
were
not
tiresome
enough
in
itself
without
everyone
being
burdened
with
the
obligation
to
like
or
pretend
that
they
like
their
country
their
relatives
their
children
and
their
church
napraxine
looked
distressed
have
liked
russia
too
sometimes
he
said
wistfully
poor
little
sachs
and
mitz
his
wife
cast
upon
him
a
glance
of
sovereign
disdain
are
only
two
things
i
like
in
russia
they
are
the
steppes
and
the
wolves
that
limitless
expanse
stretching
away
to
the
dim
grey
sky
on
every
side
and
the
sight
of
a
pack
of
the
gaunt
grey
beasts
on
the
snow
as
sledge
flies
by
those
two
things
give
one
a
sensation
which
one
does
not
get
elsewhere
but
it
is
monotonous
it
soon
ceases
to
move
one
the
wolves
never
attack
and
the
great
awful
white
plain
never
leads
to
anything
better
than
the
the
samavàr
and
the
vodki
and
the
group
of
drunken
coachmen
human
interest
in
a
word
suggested
melville
madame
napraxine
smiled
my
dear
monsignore
the
human
interest
is
quite
as
dull
as
the
steppe
and
quite
as
ravenous
as
the
wolf
how
delightful
it
must
be
to
be
a
priest
to
see
all
that
raw
material
through
not
the
interest
be
in
subduing
the
wolf
murmured
melville
even
the
steppe
under
the
fostering
touch
of
may
dews
and
june
sunlight
will
put
forth
blossoms
is
there
no
allegory
there
that
madame
napraxine
will
deign
to
accept
always
say
pretty
things
in
the
pulpit
or
out
of
it
she
replied
you
can
not
lend
me
your
to
see
them
through
so
i
fear
they
do
not
convince
me
the
astronomers
who
are
now
busy
seeing
canals
in
the
planet
mars
would
see
nothing
if
they
had
not
their
glasses
no
more
would
you
you
see
a
soul
in
a
drunken
that
is
quite
as
astonishing
and
probably
quite
as
imaginary
as
the
network
of
canals
in
mars
will
you
really
eat
nothing
monsignore
let
us
go
out
and
sit
under
that
awning
there
a
bath
of
sunshine
always
does
one
good
and
you
need
not
grudge
yourself
a
half
hour
of
leisure
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
been
passing
the
forenoon
somewhere
with
cholera
or
typhus
or
some
other
plague
of
this
sanitary
century
you
know
geraldine
that
is
monsignore
way
he
is
francis
xavier
all
the
morning
and
then
turns
himself
inside
out
and
becomes
an
abbé
for
society
have
not
been
to
anything
typhoid
or
choleraic
this
morning
or
i
should
not
be
here
to
endanger
your
loveliness
princess
answered
melville
have
been
where
poverty
is
alas
where
is
she
not
and
in
our
day
those
who
wed
with
her
regard
it
as
a
forced
marriage
wholly
joyless
and
we
can
not
persuade
them
that
there
may
be
graciousness
where
she
dwells
if
only
cleanliness
and
content
will
sit
down
with
her
monsignore
it
is
not
only
poverty
that
scares
content
i
can
assure
you
said
madame
napraxine
you
be
not
content
who
should
be
murmured
melville
every
possible
gift
of
nature
culture
fate
and
fortune
showered
upon
you
why
will
you
always
persuade
yourself
princess
that
your
doubled
mars
everything
i
do
not
believe
the
even
exists
am
not
sure
that
it
does
either
replied
madame
napraxine
i
never
remember
to
have
felt
contented
in
my
life
is
content
an
intellectual
quality
i
doubt
it
perhaps
it
is
a
virtue
i
dislike
virtues
melville
was
a
sincerely
pious
churchman
but
even
he
did
not
dare
to
take
up
the
cudgels
in
honour
of
poor
virtue
before
this
merciless
speaker
he
was
satisfied
with
replying
that
content
was
not
a
quality
which
the
tendencies
of
the
waning
nineteenth
century
were
likely
to
foster
said
the
princess
napraxine
note
of
our
time
is
restlessness
and
its
chief
attainment
the
increase
of
insanity
it
did
not
sound
too
much
like
moralising
i
should
say
that
there
was
never
any
time
in
which
there
was
so
much
and
so
little
real
rest
said
melville
who
had
the
sensitive
fear
of
a
man
of
the
world
of
appearing
to
obtrude
his
own
convictions
and
to
preach
out
of
season
and
out
of
church
require
to
have
their
brains
and
their
consciences
very
clear
and
very
calm
to
enjoy
rest
it
is
the
reward
which
nature
reserves
for
her
good
children
said
lady
brancepeth
must
be
very
good
then
said
madame
napraxine
with
her
little
mysterious
smile
i
rest
absolutely
to
know
how
to
do
nothing
is
a
great
secret
of
health
and
of
comfort
but
you
must
not
wait
till
you
are
fatigued
to
do
nothing
or
you
can
not
enjoy
it
i
suppose
you
must
occasionally
be
deaf
to
duty
knocking
at
the
door
she
should
have
her
proper
moments
of
audience
like
the
steward
the
piqueur
the
secretary
and
other
necessary
and
disagreeable
people
that
is
to
say
if
she
really
exist
monsignore
melville
evidently
is
in
the
habit
of
listening
to
her
may
say
with
josef
mon
métier
à
moi
said
melville
with
good
humour
believe
me
princess
it
is
not
duty
which
prevents
repose
it
is
far
more
often
worry
the
hateful
familiar
of
all
modern
life
worry
takes
a
million
forms
very
often
it
is
dressed
up
as
pleasure
and
perhaps
in
that
shape
is
more
distressing
than
in
any
other
the
age
has
invented
nothing
that
does
not
result
in
worry
only
look
at
the
torture
to
diplomatists
from
the
telegrams
replied
madame
napraxine
while
she
tendered
him
a
cigar
other
years
an
ambassador
had
some
pleasure
in
disentangling
a
delicate
and
intricate
embroglio
some
chance
of
making
a
great
name
by
his
skill
in
negotiation
an
able
man
was
let
alone
to
mingle
his
and
his
his
honey
and
his
aloes
as
he
thought
fit
his
knowledge
of
the
country
to
which
he
was
accredited
was
trusted
to
and
appreciated
nowadays
telegrams
rain
in
on
him
with
every
hour
he
is
allowed
no
initiative
no
independent
action
he
is
dictated
to
and
interfered
with
by
his
home
government
and
cypher
messages
torture
him
at
every
step
what
is
the
consequence
that
there
is
scarcely
a
diplomatist
left
in
europe
they
are
only
delegates
where
there
is
one
he
is
incessantly
controlled
hindered
and
annoyed
and
all
his
counsels
are
disregarded
meanwhile
the
world
only
kind
of
peace
is
a
permanent
armed
truce
but
let
us
go
into
the
garden
chapter
ii
when
nadège
fedorevna
countess
platoff
known
to
all
her
friends
by
the
of
nadine
had
reached
her
sixteenth
year
she
had
the
look
of
a
hothouse
gardenia
so
white
was
her
skin
and
so
spiritual
her
aspect
whilst
her
slender
form
had
all
the
grace
of
a
flower
balancing
itself
on
a
fragile
stalk
in
a
south
wind
that
ethereality
that
exquisite
delicacy
as
of
something
far
too
fair
and
evanescent
for
man
rude
touch
fascinated
into
a
timid
and
adoring
passion
a
and
clumsy
cuirassier
of
the
imperial
guard
who
was
also
one
of
the
greatest
nobles
written
in
the
velvet
book
of
russia
platon
nicholaivitch
head
of
the
mighty
family
of
napraxine
he
was
years
old
immeasurably
rich
popular
with
his
sovereign
a
good
soldier
and
an
exceedingly
amiable
man
he
laid
his
heart
and
everything
he
possessed
at
the
feet
of
this
exquisite
and
disdainful
child
when
he
saw
her
at
her
father
embassy
in
vienna
one
fateful
april
day
she
refused
him
without
a
moment
of
doubt
but
he
was
persevering
greatly
enamoured
and
had
both
her
parents
upon
his
side
she
was
neither
weak
nor
very
obedient
yet
in
time
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
that
not
to
accept
such
an
alliance
would
be
to
do
something
supremely
ridiculous
she
resisted
stubbornly
for
a
while
but
she
was
inquisitive
independent
and
a
little
heartless
her
mother
a
woman
of
the
world
full
of
tact
and
of
wisdom
answered
her
objection
that
the
prince
napraxine
was
stupid
had
a
kalmuck
face
and
was
inclined
to
be
corpulent
in
a
word
displeased
her
taste
in
every
way
by
frankly
admitting
these
objections
to
be
incontestable
facts
but
added
with
persuasive
equanimity
you
say
is
quite
true
my
child
but
that
sort
of
details
does
not
matter
i
assure
you
in
a
question
of
the
kind
we
are
discussing
it
would
matter
terribly
to
him
if
you
were
stupid
or
ugly
or
inclined
to
be
fat
but
in
a
man
in
a
husband
in
three
months
time
you
will
not
even
observe
it
indeed
in
a
fortnight
you
will
be
so
used
to
him
that
you
will
not
think
whether
he
is
handsome
or
ugly
familiarity
is
a
magician
that
is
cruel
to
beauty
but
kind
to
ugliness
as
for
being
inclined
to
corpulence
he
is
very
tall
he
will
carry
it
off
very
well
and
as
to
gambling
he
will
never
get
to
the
bottom
of
his
salt
mines
and
ruby
mines
that
is
the
chief
question
and
after
all
my
dear
nadine
a
man
who
will
never
interfere
with
you
and
never
quarrel
with
you
is
a
pearl
seldom
found
amongst
the
husks
and
when
the
pearl
is
set
in
gold
i
would
not
for
worlds
persuade
you
my
dear
to
marry
merely
for
certain
worldly
considerations
such
as
the
great
place
and
the
great
wealth
of
platon
nicholaivitch
but
i
would
earnestly
advise
you
to
marry
early
and
to
marry
for
peace
and
when
peace
and
a
colossal
fortune
are
to
be
found
united
it
seems
to
me
a
great
mistake
to
throw
them
both
away
somebody
else
will
take
them
i
suppose
you
dream
of
love
as
all
young
girls
do
but
at
all
i
know
this
is
only
a
question
of
marriage
said
nadine
with
that
terrible
sarcasm
on
her
lovely
young
lips
with
which
many
things
she
had
seen
in
her
mother
house
had
armed
her
for
the
battle
of
life
whilst
she
was
still
but
a
child
she
did
not
think
about
love
at
all
she
was
not
romantic
she
already
thought
it
but
she
had
a
brain
above
the
average
and
she
fancied
that
she
should
like
the
man
to
whom
she
was
given
to
be
something
great
in
intellectual
power
not
merely
in
the
sense
of
millions
and
of
rank
but
a
girl
of
sixteen
born
and
bred
in
an
embassy
reared
in
the
most
brilliant
cities
of
the
world
having
seen
the
great
panorama
of
society
pass
before
her
eyes
from
her
babyhood
is
however
innocent
in
other
ways
not
unsophisticated
enough
to
ignore
the
vast
advantages
of
such
a
position
and
such
wealth
as
the
prince
napraxine
offered
to
her
besides
her
father
wished
passionately
for
the
acceptance
of
napraxine
he
himself
was
deeply
in
debt
and
knew
that
his
constitution
had
the
germs
of
a
mortal
disease
ma
petite
he
said
to
her
gravely
one
morning
suis
criblé
de
dettes
je
peux
mourir
demain
mieux
que
tu
le
prennes
enfin
un
assez
bon
garçon
it
was
not
an
enthusiastic
eulogy
of
his
desired
but
he
never
spoke
enthusiastically
and
his
child
knew
very
well
that
under
the
negligent
slight
phrases
there
ran
a
keen
and
vivid
desire
perhaps
even
a
carking
and
unacknowledged
care
by
the
end
of
that
evening
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
and
in
three
time
was
married
to
prince
napraxine
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
marriage
was
but
only
regarding
it
as
an
entry
into
the
world
with
unlimited
jewels
and
the
power
of
going
to
any
theatres
she
chose
when
she
did
know
what
it
was
it
filled
her
with
an
inexpressible
disgust
and
melancholy
she
was
very
young
and
her
temperament
was
composed
of
that
mingled
hauteur
and
spirituality
in
which
the
senses
sleep
silent
long
sometimes
for
ever
she
bore
two
sons
in
the
first
two
years
of
her
marriage
and
then
considered
herself
free
from
further
obligations
to
provide
heirs
for
the
vast
napraxine
properties
her
husband
had
been
ardently
but
timidly
in
love
when
she
intimated
to
him
that
their
union
should
be
restricted
to
going
to
courts
together
and
being
seen
in
the
same
houses
at
discreet
intervals
he
suffered
in
his
affections
as
well
as
in
his
pride
but
he
did
not
dare
to
rebel
this
lovely
young
woman
who
was
like
a
gardenia
or
a
narcissus
who
was
not
nineteen
and
declared
that
all
the
caresses
and
obligations
of
love
were
odious
to
her
could
strike
terror
and
submission
into
the
soul
of
the
big
platon
napraxine
who
stood
six
feet
three
inches
and
had
been
no
unheroic
soldier
in
the
frosty
caucasus
and
on
the
banks
of
euphrates
and
indus
she
was
unusually
clever
clever
by
nature
and
culture
by
intellect
and
insight
keenly
delicately
clever
with
both
aptitude
and
appetite
for
learning
and
scholarship
and
within
the
first
hours
of
her
marriage
she
had
taken
his
measurement
moral
and
mental
with
merciless
accuracy
and
had
decided
to
herself
that
she
would
never
do
but
what
she
chose
he
was
a
big
dog
a
a
cipher
but
he
was
a
great
bore
and
she
put
him
aside
out
of
her
life
altogether
except
inasmuch
as
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
sit
sometimes
at
the
same
table
with
him
and
have
his
orders
blaze
beside
her
diamonds
at
state
balls
and
the
friends
of
the
prince
napraxine
envied
her
of
all
her
valuable
possessions
none
so
much
as
that
of
her
husband
whose
revenues
were
inexhaustible
and
whose
and
patience
were
equally
endless
looking
back
to
her
seventeenth
year
she
always
admitted
that
her
mother
had
judged
rightly
platon
she
would
say
to
herself
sometimes
when
she
thought
so
with
a
little
passing
flicker
of
something
like
compunction
what
had
she
given
him
in
return
for
his
great
name
his
enormous
wealth
his
magnificent
gifts
of
all
kinds
his
honest
devotion
and
his
infinite
docility
being
very
honest
when
in
of
this
sort
she
was
obliged
to
confess
to
herself
nothing
her
own
money
was
all
settled
on
herself
their
rank
had
been
quite
equal
there
were
hundreds
as
pretty
as
herself
and
she
could
not
now
recollect
that
in
six
years
of
marriage
she
had
given
him
one
affectionate
word
fault
is
not
ours
she
would
say
is
the
institution
that
is
so
stupid
people
do
not
know
how
else
to
manage
about
property
and
so
they
invented
the
marriage
state
but
it
is
an
altogether
illogical
idea
binding
down
two
strangers
side
by
side
for
ever
and
it
can
not
be
said
to
work
well
it
keeps
property
together
that
is
all
so
i
suppose
it
is
good
for
the
world
but
certainly
individuals
suffer
for
it
more
than
perhaps
property
is
worth
her
two
little
boys
were
always
left
in
the
krimea
with
the
mother
of
napraxine
they
were
much
better
there
she
thought
growing
up
robust
and
healthy
like
two
young
bear
cubs
which
to
her
eyes
they
much
resembled
in
the
pure
breezes
from
the
black
sea
when
she
did
see
them
she
was
always
amiable
to
them
even
thought
she
felt
fond
of
them
as
she
did
of
the
steppes
and
the
wolves
but
like
the
steppes
and
the
wolves
they
were
certainly
most
interesting
in
theory
and
at
a
good
long
distance
they
were
too
like
their
father
to
be
welcome
to
her
have
the
tartar
face
and
they
will
be
just
as
big
and
just
as
stupid
she
thought
whenever
she
saw
them
when
melville
who
had
been
long
intimate
with
her
family
told
her
as
he
very
often
did
that
it
was
her
duty
to
have
the
children
near
her
and
to
interest
herself
in
their
education
she
always
replied
are
exactly
like
platon
nothing
i
could
do
would
make
them
different
they
are
perfectly
well
cared
for
by
his
mother
and
brought
up
much
better
than
i
could
do
it
i
was
expected
to
give
him
an
heir
i
have
given
him
two
heirs
i
do
not
see
that
anything
more
is
required
of
me
and
when
melville
would
fain
have
insisted
on
the
usual
arguments
as
to
the
obligations
of
maternity
and
education
she
invariably
interrupted
him
and
once
said
at
full
length
the
children
were
mine
only
and
not
platon
i
could
make
something
of
them
but
they
are
formed
in
his
image
exceedingly
good
entirely
uninteresting
they
will
be
princes
napraxine
and
so
the
world
will
adore
them
though
they
be
as
stupid
as
mules
and
as
ugly
as
hedgehogs
they
do
not
interest
me
oh
you
are
shocked
even
you
the
most
original
of
churchmen
can
not
get
over
your
prejudices
believe
me
voix
de
la
does
not
speak
to
everybody
it
does
not
say
anything
at
all
to
me
will
be
an
honest
woman
it
is
much
more
she
had
said
to
herself
in
the
first
year
of
her
marriage
in
the
height
of
a
paris
winter
as
she
had
looked
around
her
on
society
with
her
brilliant
indolent
eyes
which
saw
so
clearly
and
so
far
and
surveyed
and
appraised
her
contemporaries
it
would
be
eccentric
but
distinguished
to
her
delicate
satirical
fastidious
taste
there
was
a
sort
of
vulgarity
in
being
compromised
she
did
not
go
farther
than
that
or
higher
than
that
the
thing
was
common
was
low
that
was
quite
enough
against
it
something
that
was
half
spirituality
half
hauteur
made
the
decision
easy
to
her
a
certain
chillness
of
temper
aiding
her
resolve
had
been
kept
she
had
been
as
loyal
a
wife
to
prince
napraxine
as
though
she
had
loved
him
men
did
not
obtain
any
hold
on
her
she
flirted
desperately
sometimes
amused
herself
always
but
that
was
all
when
they
tried
to
pass
from
courtiers
into
lovers
they
found
a
barrier
impalpable
but
impassable
compounded
of
her
indifference
and
her
raillery
ever
set
between
her
and
them
she
fancied
that
it
would
be
quite
intolerable
to
her
for
any
living
being
to
believe
himself
necessary
to
her
happiness
besides
she
did
not
much
believe
in
happiness
the
world
was
pleasant
enough
like
a
saloon
carriage
on
a
line
of
rail
nothing
more
you
travelled
onward
and
you
slept
comfortably
and
your
ultimate
destination
you
could
not
avoid
but
if
you
escaped
any
great
disaster
by
the
way
and
if
nobody
woke
you
with
a
shock
it
was
all
you
wanted
she
did
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
any
great
beatitude
coming
to
you
on
that
very
monotonous
route
she
had
that
admirable
tact
coupled
with
that
refined
but
unsparing
insolence
which
daunts
the
world
in
general
to
silence
and
respect
the
greatest
on
the
boulevards
never
dared
to
hint
at
a
weakness
or
a
concession
on
the
part
of
the
princess
napraxine
and
women
though
they
envied
her
bitterly
reviled
her
unsparingly
and
shivered
under
the
sting
of
her
delicate
impertinence
or
her
pregnant
epigram
yet
were
perfectly
conscious
that
she
had
never
shared
their
follies
passion
had
as
yet
no
place
in
her
complex
and
delicate
organism
she
could
not
or
would
not
understand
why
passion
should
not
be
content
to
amuse
and
worship
her
just
as
a
furnace
fire
may
only
bake
a
porcelain
cup
or
call
to
life
a
gardenia
blossom
now
and
then
this
refusal
of
hers
to
comprehend
what
she
inspired
ended
in
dire
tragedy
now
and
then
some
one
killed
himself
because
she
had
laughed
now
and
then
two
people
were
silly
enough
to
fight
a
duel
about
a
glove
she
had
dropped
or
the
right
to
take
her
down
the
stairs
at
the
opera
but
this
was
always
lamentable
and
foolish
in
her
sight
only
its
consequences
though
she
regretted
them
did
not
alter
her
if
she
had
loved
her
husband
her
victims
would
have
been
less
mortified
but
they
all
knew
very
well
that
platon
napraxine
was
no
more
to
her
than
one
of
the
chairs
in
her
if
she
had
even
loved
the
world
she
lived
in
her
coldness
would
have
been
more
intelligible
but
she
did
not

fête
of
which
society
was

up
for

her

moderately
she
was
to
the
tips
of
her
fingers
but
not
enthusiastically
so
only
so
from
habit
as
she
wore
silk
stockings
or
had
in

have
seen
the
whole
thing
since
i
was
sixteen
how
can
it
entertain
me
much
she
said
to
those
who
marvelled
at
her
indifference
when
it
was
objected
to
her
that
there
were
many
who
had
seen
it
from
sixteen
to
sixty
and
yet
thought
nothing
else
worth
seeing
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
on
the
whole
she
understood
the
sect
of
the
skoptzi
better
they
had
an
ideal
what
ideal
had
her
world
she
kept
her
exquisite
tint
and
her
lovely
eyes
unspoiled
by
the
endless
late
hours
and
the
incessant
excitations
in
which
women
of
the
où
lose
their
youth
in
a
year
or
two
she
ate
very
simply
drank
little
but
water
rode
or
drove
no
matter
what
weather
refused
out
of
fifty
of
all
the
invitations
she
received
seldom
or
never
made
any
house
visits
and
spent
many
hours
in
perfect
repose
should
you
go
and
stay
in

she
always
said
to
her
english
friends
in
whom
this
mania
is
more
rampant
than
amongst
any
other
nationality
person
house
is
hardly
better
than
an
hotel
indeed
very
often
it
is
worse
if
you
like
the
you
can
not
change
it
if
you
are
given
slow
horses
you
can
not
complain
if
you
dislike
your
rooms
you
can
not
alter
them
if
you
think
the
a
bad
one
you
can
not

so
if
you
find
all
the

bore
you
you
can
not

rid
of
them
you
must
pretend
to
eat
all

long
you
must
pretend
to
feel
amiable
from
noon
to
midnight
you
must
have
all
kinds
of
plans
made
for
you
and
submit
to
them
you
can
never
read
but
in
your
own
room
and
generally
speaking
there
is
nothing
in
the
library
if
it
be
an
english
library
except
tennyson
wordsworth
and
darwin
i
can
not
imagine
how
any
reasonable
being
subjects
herself
to
such
a
martyrdom
only
because
somebody
else
finds
their
country
place
dull
without
people
she
had
also
ingeniously
established
a
reputation
for
very
delicate
health
which
she
found
beyond
anything
useful
to
spare
her
from
being
bored
and
to
excuse
her
absence
from
any
gathering
which
did
not

attract

said
once
to

always
promise
you

i

an
enchanting
doctor
in

you
know
him
de
thiviers
he
is
very
famous
he
will
shake
his
head
over
me
as
if
i
were
doomed
to
die
in
ten
minutes
and
he
frightens
platon
out
of
his
wits
he
gets
a
great

at

end
of
the
season
and
he
and
i
look
as
grave
as
the

like
the

we
are
both
longing
to

it

very

you
have
an

everything
if
at

last

you
do
wish
to

nobody

if
it

would
never

me
my
continual
absence
from

certainly
should

passport

between
her
reputation
for
a
dangerous
disease
in
her
system
and
her
really
intelligent
care
of
her
health
she
had
the
paths
of
life
made
very
smooth
to
her
and
was
infinitely
freer
from
any
genuine
indisposition
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
fragility
of
her
aspect
and
her
russian
love
of
hot
rooms
and
yellow
tea
still
as
a
great
comedian
will
so
identify
himself
with
his
part
that
he
at
times
believes
himself

he

she
did
at
times
almost
persuade
herself
as
she
completely
persuaded
others
that
she
had
some
great
constitutional
delicacy
to
contend
with
and
she
would
play
at
medicine
with
little
needles
for
morphia
or
a

she

would
say
in
moments
of
confidence
at
the
quantity
of
weariness
that

no

you
can
not

but
if
you
are
known
to
be
in
delicate
health
no
one
can
be
offended
if
at
the
last
moment
quite
unexpectedly
you
get
a
chill
and
must
not
stir
out
of
your
own
room
when
there
is
some
unutterable
social
tedium
looming
on
the
horizon
i

for
de

and
he
is
always
equal
to
the
occasion
in

as
in
other
matters
she
arranged
her
life
to
her
own
satisfaction
without
any
kind
of
misgiving
that
this
was
egotistical
everything
had
combined
to
make
her
an
egotist
an
only
child
adored
by
her
father
admired
and
a
little
feared
by
her
mother
whose
most
intimate
secrets
she
had
divined
with
all
the
keen
intuition
of
her
natural
intelligence
surrounded
from
her
earliest
years
by
a
court
of
dependents
and
servants
who
seemed
only
to
live
to
minister
to
her
caprices
flattered
from
her
babyhood
by
all
her
father
friends
secretaries
and
attachés
she
had
imbibed
selfishness
as
inevitably
as
a
young
willow
sucks
in
the
moisture
from
the
stream
by
which
it
grows
there
was
nothing
in
a
loveless
marriage
and
in
the
clumsy
and
irritating
devotion
of
a
man
who
was
ardently
in
love
with
her
whilst
she
only
viewed
him
with
contempt
and
dislike
to
counteract
the
influences
of
her
earlier
years
the
whole
world
conspired
to
induce
the
princess
napraxine
to
live
only
for
herself
that
she
occasionally
had
moments
of
supreme
generosity
and
a
capacity
seldom
or
never
called
out
for
heroic
courage
did
not
alter
the
main
fact
that
her
life
was
essentially
selfish
she
never
did
anything
that
she
did
not
wish
to
do
the
great
want
in
her
existence
to
herself
was
that
she
so
very
seldom
felt
any
wish
for
anything
when
she
did
she
gratified
it
without
any
scruple
or
hesitation
her
mind
was
too
clear
and
logical
for
any
creed
to
obtain
any
hold
upon
her
nominally
of
course
she
was
of
the
greek
church
and
had
too
much
good
taste
to
create
any
scandal
by
openly
separating
herself
from
it
but
her
intelligence
as
critical
and
as
subtle
as
or
bolingbroke
would
no
more
have
submitted
to
the
bondage
of
religious
superstition
and
tradition
than
she
would
have
clothed
her
graceful
person
in
one
of
the
that
hung
in
the
windows
of
paris
in
morality
also
she
did
not
much
believe
she
read
stuart
mill
plea
for
the
utility
of
virtue
once
and
smiled
as
she
closed
the
book
with
a
mental
verdict
of
pride
that
pride
which
has
been
happily
defined
by
a
french
writer
as
mais
de
la
and
the
delicacy
of
her
taste
with
her
profound
indifference
supplied
the
place
in
her
of
moral
laws
and
probably
acted
on
her
much
more
effectively
than
they
would
have
done
principle
is
but
a
palisade
temperament
is
a
stone
bastion
honnêtes
gens
et
les
mauvaises
gens
me
déplaisent
she
was
wont
to
say
with
a
frank
confession
of
what
many
others
have
felt
and
have
not
had
the
courage
to
say
she
had
no
more
rigidity
of
principle
than
any
other
person
who
has
been
reared
in
the
midst
of
a
witty
elegant
and
corrupt
society
but
her
perfect
taste
supplied
the
place
of
moral
convictions
the
grossness
of
vice
offended
her
like
a
bad
odour
or
a
staring
colour
and
everything
loose
or
coarse
seemed
to
her
an
affront
to
intelligence
and
to
refinement
sometimes
she
almost
envied
the
women
who
could
plunge
themselves
into
the
hot
springs
of
a
passion
only
it
seemed
to
her
vulgar
the
same
sort
of
vulgarity
as
swimming
in
public
in
a
she
could
swim
like
an
otter
but
she
never
swam
in
public
the
noisy
and
ungrateful
pleasures
which
delight
modern
society
seemed
to
her
sheer
imbecilities
whilst
she
would
as
soon
have
descended
to
an
intrigue
with
her
cook
or
her
coachman
as
have
made
an
amorous
appointment
in
a
private
room
at
a
café
or
have
mounted
the
stairs
of
a
hired
house
to
meet
a
lovelace
of
the
clubs
être
plus
bête
she
would
say
with
supreme
disdain
whenever
she
heard
of
the
vulgarities
which
usually
accompany
apate
and
philotes
in
these
the
waning
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
she
quite
understood
the
parisienne
in
who
tempted
to
make
an
assignation
awakes
to
a
sense
of
its
coarseness
and
commonness
when
she
finds
that
the
temple
of
love
is
upon
the
third
floor
in
the
rue
du
petit
hurleur
and
that
the
has
poniatowskys
jumping
into
the
elster
repeated
on
every
length
of
it
that
sort
of
affair
she
said
once
must
have
either
secrecy
or
a
scandal
both
to
me
seem
in
bad
taste
and
then
with
the
one
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
your
maid
and
with
the
other
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
newspapers
to
be
sure
she
added
can
not
perhaps
measure
the
force
of
the
temptation
for
i
have
never
in
my
life
seen
any
human
being
to
meet
whom
i
should
have
ever
thought
it
worth
while
even
to
order
out
my
innumerable
lives
had
done
their
uttermost
to
entwine
themselves
in
hers
and
had
only
broken
themselves
helplessly
on
the
rock
of
her
supreme
indifference
like
so
many
ships
upon
icebergs
she
was
a
in
the
uttermost
sense
of
that
expressive
word
but
she
was
scarcely
a
coquette
though
the
most
merciless
coquetry
might
have
done
much
less
harm
than
she
did
a
coquette
desires
and
strives
to
please
nadine
napraxine
fascinated
other
lives
to
hers
without
effort
if
without
pity
she
had
one
supreme
end
to
endeavour
to
amuse
herself
and
she
had
one
unending
appetite
that
of
the
study
of
character
she
so
seldom
succeeded
in
amusing
herself
that
she
came
naturally
to
the
conclusion
that
most
characters
contained
no
amusing
elements
was
her
single
word
of
explication
to
those
whose
homage
she
had
permitted
for
a
while
only
to
send
them
adrift
without
a
sign
of
compassion
or
contrition
to
her
the
three
words
seemed
entirely
comprehensive
when
some
one
more
daring
than
the
others
had
once
ventured
to
remind
her
that
he
had
not
been
quite
so
hateful
to
her
only
a
brief
while
before
she
had
said
with
some
impatience
one
know
that
a
book
is
dull
unless
one
looks
at
a
few
pages
it
is
not
one
fault
if
it
be
i
can
not
say
why
you
all
weary
me
but
if
you
do
it
is
not
my
fault
either
when
once
they
wearied
her
it
was
of
no
use
for
them
by
any
ingenuity
subserviency
or
despair
to
attempt
to
regain
her
favour
her
path
like
that
of
all
great
victors
was
strewn
with
unregarded
victims
now
and
then
her
composure
had
been
ruffled
when
the
fate
of
someone
of
these
had
roused
the
adverse
comments
of
the
world
and
the
issue
of
some
duel
or
the
fact
of
some
suicide
had
had
her
name
by
common
consent
coupled
with
it
she
disliked
that
kind
of
notoriety
sincerely
disliked
it
with
all
the
hauteur
and
disgust
of
a
very
proud
and
sensitive
refinement
but
it
never
made
her
change
the
tenor
of
her
ways
you
do
not
like
would
it
not
be
better
to
to
not
to
give
rise
to
it
napraxine
himself
had
once
humbly
ventured
to
suggest
when
she
was
excessively
angered
because
the
journals
of
the
hour
had
ventured
to
introduce
her
name
into
their
narratives
of
a
duel
ending
in
the
death
of
the
young
principe
who
had
been
very
popular
and
beloved
in
french
and
italian
society
potin
she
had
echoed
can
not
you
say
scandal
what
sense
is
there
in
slang
give
rise
to
it
ivrea
was
a
nice
boy
but
irascible
like
all
italians
and
intensely
vain
the
least
word
irritated
him
he
chose
to
provoke
de
prangins
because
de
prangins
teased
him
and
the
old
man
has
been
too
strong
for
the
young
one
it
is
a
great
pity
he
had
a
pretty
face
and
a
pretty
manner
but
i
have
no
more
to
do
with
his
death
than
the
gilt
arrow
on
the
top
of
the
house
myself
i
would
much
rather
he
had
killed
de
prangins
napraxine
had
preserved
a
reverential
silence
he
knew
that
there
was
another
side
to
the
story
but
he
did
not
venture
to
say
so
when
the
jealousies
feuds
and
quarrels
which
it
amused
her
to
excite
and
foment
arrived
at
any
such
tragical
conclusion
as
this
with
which
the
duc
de
prangins
had
disembarrassed
her
salons
of
a
youth
who
of
late
had
grown
too
presuming
she
was
always
entirely
innocent
of
being
the
cause
of
it
always
tell
them
to
like
each
other
she
would
say
placidly
but
therein
they
did
not
obey
her
she
valued
her
power
of
destruction
as
the
only
possible
means
of
her
own
amusement
it
reconciled
her
to
herself
when
she
was
most
disposed
to
be
discontented
her
delicate
lips
smiled
with
ineffable
disdain
when
she
saw
other
women
tordant
comme
des
as
she
expressed
it
in
their
effort
to
secure
the
admiration
or
retain
the
passions
of
men
while
she
merely
lifting
the
cloud
of
her
black
lashes
in
the
sunshine
by
the
lake
or
sitting
still
as
marble
in
the
shadow
of
her
box
at

the

now
as

rose
from

drew
her
delicate
skirts
with
their
undulating
waves
and
foam
of
lace
out
through
the

doors
and
over
the
marble
of
the
terrace
to
the
sheltered
nook
in

she
had
been
sitting
before

where
a
square
smyrna
carpet
was
placed
under
several

was

and
the

is
all
in
dreadful
taste
she
said
for
the
hundredth
time
sort
of
scenery
mixed
up
with
châlets
villas
and
hotels
has
such
a
look
of
the
stage
it
seems
made
on
purpose
for
beauties
dyed
and
pampered
gamblers
and
great
ladies
who
are
received
nowhere
else
places
have
all
a
physiognomy
moral
as
well
as
physical
the
riviera
must
have
been
enchanting
when
there
was
only
a
as
wide
as
a
ribbon
between
the
hills
and
the
sea
from
marseilles
to
genoa
but
now
that
the
moral
emanations
of
monte
carlo
and
of
the
at
all
the
nondescript
houses
and
of
the
baccarat
groups
in
the
clubs
which
are
not
as
exclusive
as
they
might
be
have
spread
all
along
the
coast
like
miasma
the
whole
thing
is
only
a
de
the
very
gardens
are
masquerading
as
egypt
as
damascus
as
palermo
it
is
all
are
very
cruel
madame
murmured
melville
is
the
only
thing
you
can
any
of
you
find
to
reply
when
i
say
anything
that
is
true
said
the
princess
with
triumph
de
vannes
are
your
nearest
neighbours
suggested
her
husband
you
mean
that
is
she
said
with
her
little
low
laugh
fear
neither
of
them
will
contribute
anything
to
redeem
the
character
of
the
place
for
either
or
gambling
would
you
come
to
it
he
asked
with
all
a
man
stupidity
do
people
ever
ask
one
why
one
does
things
she
interrupted
irritably
imagines
one
will
like
a
thing
one
gets
it
and
directly
of
course
one
does
not
like
it
that
is
a
kind
of
general
law
monsignore
melville
will
tell
us
i
suppose
that
it
is
to
prevent
us
attaching
ourselves
to
the
pleasures
of
this
world
but
as
it
also
operates
in
preventing
one
attaching
oneself
to
anybody
as
well
as
anything
i
do
not
know
that
the
result
is
as
admirable
as
he
would
imagine
never
said
began
melville
no
but
you
would
say
if
you
were
in
the
pulpit
she
replied
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
would
say
that
even
and
satiety
and
depression
have
their
uses
if
they
lead
the
soul
to
heaven
but
that
is
just
what
they
do
not
do
they
only
lead
to
morphia
chloral
dyspepsia
and
karlsbad
it
is
quite
impossible
it
must
be
quite
impossible
even
for
you
monsignore
to
consider
karlsbad
as
an
antechamber
to
heaven
melville
tried
to
look
shocked
but
did
not
succeed
well
as
he
was
a
little
rabelaisian
and
montaignist
at
heart
and
not
intended
by
nature
for
a
churchman
are
we
going
to
do
said
the
prince
as
he
stretched
himself
in
his
chair
and
lighted
another
cigarette
where
we
are
suggested
geraldine
who
desired
nothing
better
as
a
was
a
favour
never
accorded
to
him
twice
in
hours
not
i
indeed
cried
napraxine
with
as
much
alacrity
as
was
possible
beneath
his
heavy
of
flesh
shall
go
to
monte
carlo
i
have
told
them
to
harness
if
you
like
to
come
at
that
moment
a
servant
brought
him
a
card
he
read
what
was
written
in
pencilled
lines
upon
it
then
raised
his
head
with
a
pleased
exclamation
vous
le
donne
en
mille
he
cried
who
do
you
think
is
here
goose
with
a
diseased
liver
or
a
hundred
green
oysters
said
his
wife
contemptuously
can
imagine
no
lesser
source
for
so
much
radiance
the
prince
regardless
of
sarcasm
or
tempered
to
endurance
of
it
by
long
habit
answered
placidly
it
is
othmar
the
face
of
nadine
napraxine
changed
considerably
the
most
astute
observer
could
not
have
decided
whether
annoyance
or
gratification
was
the
most
visible
expression
her
eyes
lighted
with
a
look
different
to
the
mild
amusement
with
which
she
had
greeted
geraldine
can
he
have
come
from
continued
her
husband
was
in
asia
a
little
while
ago
one
is
always
so
glad
to
see
him
he
is
so
unlike
other
people
it
is
only
you
nadine
who
do
not
appreciate
him
is
said
she
with
languor
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
reason
enough
to
keep
him
waiting
at
the
gate
forgot
said
napraxine
is
no
one
less
i
assure
you
clever
as
you
are
you
sometimes
mistake
grégor
beg
count
othmar
to
join
us
here
the
servant
withdrew
princess
nadine
put
a
large
peacock
fan
between
her
and
the
sun
she
yawned
a
little
minutes
for
grégor
to
send
down
to
the
gate
seven
minutes
for
othmar
to
come
up
from
the
gate
a
minute
and
a
half
more
for
him
to
traverse
the
house
we
have
fifteen
minutes
and
a
half
in
which
to
vilify
our
coming
friend
as
modern
hospitality
binds
us
to
do
let
us
begin
we
must
be
stupid
indeed
if
we
can
not
kill
anybody
character
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
is
no
character
to
kill
began
her
husband
me
no
one
can
say
he
is
characterless
he
is
a
very
marked
character
was
not
what
i
meant
said
napraxine
meant
that
no
one
could
say
otherwise
than
good
of
him
and
if
there
were
such
a
one
he
should
not
say
it
before
me
nadine
napraxine
let
her
eye
rest
on
her
husband
with
a
peculiar
expression
half
pity
half
derision
which
might
have
given
him
plentiful
food
for
reflection
had
he
been
a
man
who
ever
reflected
platon
he
has
all
the
antique
virtues
she
said
softly
even
thinks
it
necessary
to
defend
his
acquaintances
behind
their
backs
type
admirable
do
you
like
othmar
prince
said
geraldine
abruptly
detest
him
said
napraxine
in
surprise
must
be
almost
alone
then
what
do
you
see
to
dislike
geraldine
glanced
at
his
hostess
but
she
refused
to
accept
the
challenge
of
his
regard
she
was
looking
out
to
sea
with
a
little
dreamy
amused
smile
hate
all
financiers
said
geraldine
moodily
and
lamely
grande
is
one
gigantic
nest
of
brigands
those
men
get
everything
whilst
we
lose
even
our
old
acres
that
is
your
fault
said
prince
platon
othmar
believe
me
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
the
othmar
are
pure
croats
croats
loathe
hebrews
is
very
fortunate
prince
to
have
your
admiration
and
your
confidence
said
geraldine
with
a
sarcasm
lost
on
the
pachydermatous
placidity
of
his
host
have
always
liked
othmar
since
one
day
of
which
i
will
tell
you
when
we
have
more
time
answered
napraxine
tell
us
now
said
his
wife
have
always
been
curious
to
know
the
affinity
between
you
and
othmar
it
is
a
walrus
gambling
with
a
stag
i
the
walrus
it
is
an
awkward
animal
said
her
husband
the
tale
can
wait
he
will
be
here
in
a
moment
he
were
an
admirable
crichton
he
would
be
detestable
if
only
because
he
is
so
hideously
rich
interrupted
geraldine
with
sullenness
the
princess
has
already
spoken
of
another
defect
the
greatest
a
man
can
have
to
my
thinking
he
is
said
the
prince
what
do
you
mean
othmar
i
should
say
never
thinks
of
himself
he
is
certainly
said
geraldine
with
an
undisguised
cruel
exultation
in
the
cruel
epithet
is
a
croesus
and
he
poses
for
simplicity
he
is
a
financier
and
he
poses
as
a
he
is
gorged
with
gold
and
he
poses
as
a
spartan
on
black
broth
the
whole
life
of
the
man
is
affectation
his
humility
is
as
detestable
as
his
pride
his
liberalities
are
as
offensive
as
his
possessions
tiens
murmured
napraxine
taking
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
dear
friend
you
are
under
my
roof
or
at
least
on
my
terrace
so
i
can
not
quarrel
with
you
i
can
only
ask
you
kindly
to
remember
what
i
said
a
little
while
ago
and
to
spare
me
again
recalling
to
you
that
othmar
also
is
my
friend
you
will
understand
geraldine
coloured
slightly
conscious
of
having
been
and
muttered
sullenly
beg
your
pardon
a
more
tart
and
stinging
retort
was
on
his
lips
to
the
effect
that
the
new
comer
was
the
last
man
on
earth
whom
his
host
should
welcome
but
his
awe
of
the
princess
napraxine
repressed
it
she
herself
gave
her
husband
a
glance
of
more
appreciation
than
she
had
ever
cast
on
him
and
said
to
herself
walrus
is
the
clumsiest
and
the
stupidest
of
all
living
creatures
but
it
is
so
honest
and
said
aloud
your
quotations
was
the
advice
given
by
a
dying
don
to
an
oxford
student
geraldine
quoted
from
me
but
he
did
not
stay
to
verify
what
he
quoted
i
spoke
in
haste
othmar
is
a
tiny
trifle
of
a
but
it
is
quite
unconsciously
it
is
the
consequence
of
an
anomalous
position
all
his
instincts
refuse
to
be
the
samuel
bernard
of
his
generation
and
he
is
equally
horrified
at
the
idea
of
appearing
as
a
sidonia
if
he
had
only
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
he
would
be
happy
and
charming
as
it
is
with
his
ten
millions
or
his
ten
hundred
millions
there
is
always
the
sense
of
that
wall
of
ingots
filling
up
the
background
and
keeping
as
he
thinks
the
sunshine
out
of
his
life
occasionally
it
makes
him
see
everything
yellow
like
the
jaundice
and
to
everybody
else
it
makes
him
seem
a
colossus
which
is
distressing
to
him
as
he
is
of
ordinary
stature
is
even
taller
than
i
am
said
her
husband
princess
napraxine
who
had
made
her
little
speech
languidly
looking
at
the
sea
and
extended
full
length
on
her
indian
cane
chair
said
with
a
little
smile
dear
i
spoke
metaphorically
i
did
not
mean
to
underrate
your
friend
centimètres
i
meant
merely
to
explain
that
if
he
do
look
occasionally
a
it
is
the
fault
of
europe
which
ever
since
he
was
born
has
persisted
in
worshipping
him
as
one
of
the
incarnations
of
mammon
if
he
had
belonged
to
grande
he
would
have
been
much
happier
jews
can
swallow
any
amount
of
flattery
as
they
can
wear
any
number
of
rings
he
likes
neither
othmar
announced
grégor
ascending
the
terrace
steps
from
the
gardens
the
person
announced
was
a
man
of
some
thirty
years
old
with
delicate
and
handsome
features
and
an
expression
at
once
gentle
and
cold
his
height
was
great
and
his
bearing
that
of
a
he
looked
weary
and
dissatisfied
yet
his
life
was
one
of
the
most
envied
of
europe
he
greeted
napraxine
with
warmth
the
princess
with
grace
and
ceremony
geraldine
and
his
sister
with
a
rather
cold
courtesy
nadine
napraxine
had
flushed
a
little
as
he
kissed
her
hand
a
lovely
faint
flush
which
made
her
cheeks
like
two
geraldine
noticed
that
momentary
change
of
colour
and
thought
bitterly
never
looked
like
that
for
napraxine
was
not
so
observant
his
hospitable
soul
was
filled
with
the
pleasure
of
welcoming
his
friend
and
he
felt
angered
with
his
wife
because
she
said
so
indifferently
wonder
you
did
not
stay
amongst
the
mongols
othmar
they
must
be
much
more
original
than
we
are
they
ride
all
day
long
do
they
over
deserts
of
grass
how
enchanting
i
wonder
you
could
tear
yourself
away
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
stay
said
othmar
with
a
meaning
which
she
alone
understood
i
fear
the
world
holds
us
too
strongly
for
us
to
be
long
content
even
with
a
tartar
mare
and
a
fat
sheep
tail
i
am
fortunate
to
find
you
all
here
i
came
from
egypt
i
saw
your
name
in
a
newspaper
and
could
not
resist
driving
over
to
la
jacquemerille
have
your
berenice
she
has
behaved
very
well
we
met
with
a
typhoon
in
the
indian
ocean
and
were
nearly
lost
but
she
has
been
patched
up
and
ran
home
bravely
i
have
left
her
at
marseilles
to
be
thoroughly
overhauled
will
have
to
try
her
in
a
match
with
geraldine
zostera
could
not
hope
to
compete
with
count
othmar
said
geraldine
sullenly
for
him
the
skies
were
overcast
the
sun
was
clouded
the
pretty
marble
terrace
with
its
gay
awnings
seemed
dark
with
the
gloom
of
night
he
hated
la
jacquemerille
which
he
had
been
so
eager
to
persuade
his
friends
to
inhabit
who
could
have
told
that
this
man
would
drop
on
this
mediterranean
shore
without
note
of
warning
at
a
moment
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
safe
on
the
sandy
steppes
of
mongolia
count
othmar
never
i
believe
shot
anything
in
his
life
i
can
not
perceive
what
possible
attraction
any
wild
life
can
have
for
him
he
added
now
in
a
tone
that
was
aggressive
and
impertinent
othmar
glanced
at
him
with
a
regard
which
said
much
as
he
replied
simply
have
shot
the
most
noxious
animal
man
i
have
never
i
confess
shot
wood
doves
or
tame
pheasants
will
shoot
doves
all
the
week
said
the
princess
with
a
sense
that
la
jacquemerille
had
become
interesting
she
loved
to
see
men
on
the
brink
of
a
quarrel
sometimes
she
restrained
them
from
passing
the
brink
sometimes
she
did
not
sometimes
she
helped
them
over
it
with
a
little
imperceptible
touch
light
as
the
touch
of
a
feather
which
yet
had
all
the
power
of
electricity
is
modern
knighthood
said
othmar
prefer
my
mongols
brother
is
english
said
lady
brancepeth
to
avert
disagreeable
rejoinders
always
reminds
me
of
the
old
french
caricature
it
is
a
beautiful
day
let
us
go
and
kill
something
is
more
english
than
croat
said
napraxine
he
does
not
kill
things
he
prefers
to
paint
them
doublé
de
murmured
his
wife
have
you
sketched
any
mongol
ladies
are
there
such
beings
or
are
they
only
as
that
terrible
dumas
has
it
femelle
de
femelle
de
madame
they
can
not
be
said
to
be
women
in
any
civilised
sense
of
that
term
they
only
know
the
duties
of
maternity
and
are
ignorant
of
the
victories
of
coquetry
you
will
perceive
that
they
are
an
entirely
elementary
animal
princess
nadine
heard
with
a
little
smile
she
knew
what
allusions
to
herself
were
contained
in
the
words
should
have
married
one
of
them
she
said
slowly
moving
her
big
fan
would
have
been
too
picturesque
the
owner
of
two
hundred
millions
dwelling
by
choice
under
a
pole
and
a
piece
of
blue
cloth
and
can
not
you
forbear
to
quote
my
millions
said
othmar
would
not
reproach
a
hunchback
with
his
hump
it
is
the
only
thing
which
makes
him
noticeable
muttered
geraldine
but
the
fear
of
his
hostess
made
him
speak
too
low
to
be
overheard
save
by
othmar
who
did
not
deign
to
notice
the
insolence
think
money
is
not
interesting
said
the
princess
nadine
you
are
wrong
it
is
the
haroun
al
raschid
of
our
day
it
is
the
wand
of
mercury
it
is
the
sunshine
of
life
only
fancy
othmar
if
you
chose
you
could
make
the
desert
blossom
like
the
rose
you
could
call
up
a
city
like
paris
in
the
centre
of
your
mongolian
steppes
that
is
very
interesting
indeed
money
itself
is
not
so
but
when
one
considers
its
enormous
influence
its
fantastic
powers
it
is
so
it
is
even
more
it
is
positively
bewitching
it
comes
out
of
anything
so
fairylike
and
invisible
as
the
prince
it
may
be
replied
othmar
not
when
it
is
tainted
by
commerce
remember
princess
your
mercury
was
the
god
of
the
mart
and
of
the
thieves
was
in
the
roman
decadence
are
we
not
in
a
decadence
is
the
fashion
to
say
so
but
i
am
not
sure
have
we
decayed
and
if
we
have
from
what
the
last
century
contained
nothing
noble
the
burning
of
moscow
belongs
to
this
said
othmar
with
a
bow
to
napraxine
whose
grandfather
had
been
one
of
the
foremost
generals
at
the
defence
of
moscow
and
one
of
the
chief
counsellors
of
that
heroic
sacrifice
always
remembers
what
is
fine
in
history
and
in
his
friends
said
the
prince
well
pleased
is
not
like
nadine
there
indeed
said
lady
brancepeth
always
likes
to
see
that
a
great
man
is
a
little
one
somewhere
she
will
always
find
out
the
speck
on
the
handsome
rosy
apple
the
yellow
stain
on
the
ivory
the
rift
in
the
lute
that
is
her
way
she
would
never
have
admired
johnson
she
would
have
only
laughed
at
his
uncouthness
and
his
dishes
of
tea
and
only
seen
that
he
touched
all
the
posts
in
the
streets
can
not
help
it
if
i
am
observant
and
johnson
certainly
would
have
bored

délicats

quoted
othmar
you
and
i
are
both
profoundly
miserable
said
nadine
napraxine
believe
we
have
never
found
anything
that
satisfied
either
of
us
perhaps
each
other
muttered
geraldine
in
a
smothered
voice
his
jealousy
conquering
his
prudence
it
was
a
phrase
which
no
one
heard
except
his
hostess
who
was
as
quick
at
hearing
as
fine
ears
she
did
not
deign
to
take
any
notice
of
it
it
could
be
punished
at
her
leisure
an
idiot
he
is
she
thought
if
tone
could
ever
succeed
with
she
had
herself
become
amused
serene
immediately
that
with
the
entrance
of
othmar
the
twin
masks
of
tragedy
and
comedy
had
appeared
to
her
prescient
eyes
to
lie
upon
the
stage
of
the
terrace
of
la
jacquemerille
the
whole
place
changed
to
her
the
view
was
beautiful
the
house
was
quaint
and
full
of
colour
and
variety
the
orange
wood
was
a
delightful
bit
of
local
colour
the
marble
colonnade
and
the
brown
wooden
balconies
were
absurd
certainly
but
garlanded
about
with
all
those
sweet
american
creepers
they
had
a
graceful
effect
nowhere
else
in
december
would
you
get
roses
and
geraniums
and
white
marbles
and
blue
waves
and
a
thermometer
at
réaumur
othmar
had
brought
that
dramatic
element
into
her
life
without
which
despite
her
really
very
high
intelligence
ennui
was
apt
to
descend
upon
her
when
his
eyes
encountered
that
look
they
became
very
cold
and
had
a
challenge
in
them
the
challenge
of
a
man
who
defies
a
woman
to
make
him
again
the
slave
of
her
caprices
her
husband
saw
nothing
of
those
glances
geraldine
saw
more
even
than
there
was
to
see
and
became
moody
and
dejected
he
only
roused
himself
now
and
then
to
say
what
he
thought
might
be
hostile
or
disagreeable
to
the
new
comer
his
remarks
were
ignored
by
othmar
which
increased
his
irritation
the
princess
was
amused
as
she
was
occasionally
at
a
good
theatre
by
the
sullenness
of
the
one
man
and
by
the
coldness
of
the
other
both
had
elements
perhaps
of
tragedy
and
comedy
she
felt
a
sudden
exhilaration
and
increase
of
interest
such
as
a
person
fond
of
a
theatre
feels
when
the
great
actor
of
the
hour
makes
his
entry
on
the
scene
geraldine
was
very
useful
she
had
known
him
several
years
he
was
always
hopelessly
in
love
with
her
timid
devoted
and
obedient
but
he
had
no
originality
of
character
to
make
him
very
interesting
he
was
extremely
very
popular
and
very
amiable
but
he
was
commonplace
he
had
not
the
wit
of
his
sister
she
had
admitted
him
into
her
intimacy
because
he
was
humble
handsome
and
usually
so
docile
that
he
seldom
irritated
her
but
he
gave
no
interest
to
her
life
whatever
whereas
othmar
she
had
scarcely
ever
confessed
it
even
to
herself
but
whilst
othmar
had
been
lost
to
sight
in
the
wilds
of
asia
society
had
seemed
to
her
even
more
stupid
than
usual
one
had
been
in
love
with
her
for
a
year
the
other
two
years
before
had
loved
her
there
was
a
considerable
difference
in
the
two
passions
which
she
with
her
analytical
mind
could
perfectly
appraise
for
the
one
she
was
quite
sure
of
her
sentiment
in
return
he
was
agreeable
useful
submissive
he
diverted
her
sometimes
wearied
her
occasionally
obeyed
her
always
she
liked
him
and
liked
better
still
to
tease
him
the
other
had
brought
into
her
life
a
sense
of
a
stormier
emotion
than
she
cared
to
raise
he
had
been
more
in
earnest
than
she
chose
to
allow
he
had
loved
her
imperiously
ardently
unreasonably
when
she
had
made
light
of
it
he
had
left
her
with
indignation
and
scorn
he
had
been
one
of
those
who
had
fought
a
duel
about
her
though
none
but
himself
and
his
adversary
had
ever
known
that
she
was
the
cause
of
it
a
card
at
having
served
as
the
colourable
pretext
she
had
never
been
quite
sure
what
she
had
felt
for
him
admiration
in
a
way
perhaps
but
more
she
thought
dislike
but
his
had
been
one
of
the
conquests
which
had
most
flattered
her
when
he
had
left
all
his
habits
and
friends
and
possessions
to
plunge
into
asian
solitudes
she
had
felt
that
her
power
over
him
was
illimitable
and
now
he
had
returned
and
told
her
with
as
much
chill
assertion
as
a
regard
could
convey
that
her
power
existed
no
more
for
him
she
did
not
care
but
the
change
interested
her
and
piqued
her
othmar
she
had
said
often
to
herself
when
remembering
the
passages
which
had
passed
between
them
and
thinking
of
him
in
asia
and
now
he
was
back
from
asia
and
sitting
on
her
at
la
jacquemerille
and
was
telling
her
by
manner
and
by
glance
perhaps
telling
her
too
persistently
and
insistantly
for
it
to
be
entirely
true
that
he
had
vanquished
his
madness
it
had
been
a
strong
if
madness
born
first
in
a
in
the
ardennes
in
and
tapestried
galleries
and
the
stately
revelries
of
a
legitimist
party
of
pleasure
fanned
by
her
own
will
into
flame
in
the
course
of
a
brilliant
giddy
insensate
winter
season
in
paris
then
with
spring
had
come
the
decisive
moment
when
he
had
declined
to
be
content
any
longer
with
his
position
and
he
had
been
lightly
laughed
at
disdainfully
jested
with
and
had
revolted
and
had
gone
out
of
europe
after
a
duel
which
had
made
even
her
tranquil
pulses
beat
a
little
quickly
in
apprehension
of
the
possible
issue
with
her
usual
consummate
tact
she
had
so
borne
herself
that
the
six
or
eight
months
devotion
in
which
othmar
had
been
the
shadow
of
her
every
step
had
attracted
no
injurious
notice
from
her
husband
or
her
world
it
was
known
that
he
was
passionately
attached
to
her
but
so
many
were
so
also
that
beyond
a
little
more
attention
than
usual
because
he
was
a
more
conspicuous
person
than
most
the
great
world
of
paris
only
smiled
and
watched
to
see
if
the
snowflake
melted
it
did
not
melt
and
he
went
to
asia
the
duel
had
only
come
out
of
a
trivial
dispute
at
a
club
so
every
one
believed
prince
napraxine
as
innocently
as
the
rest
it
was
after
the
departure
of
othmar
that
her
society
took
to
naming
her
the
de
it
seemed
strange
both
to
men
and
women
that
othmar
should
have
been
so
near
her
so
long
and
have
left
no
impression
on
her
life
he
had
usually
a
strong
influence
on
those
whom
he
sought
in
this
instance
he
had
been
the
magnetised
not
the
magnetiser
men
always
quoted
princess
nadine
to
their
wives
as
an
example
to
be
followed
for
the
serene
indifference
with
which
she
flirted
all
the
year
through
yet
never
was
compromised
by
a
breath
of
calumny
their
wives
sometimes
retorted
that
she
had
no
heart
so
could
not
lose
it
promise
you
i
will
never
be
compromised
she
had
said
to
her
father
a
few
months
after
her
marriage
and
he
a
very
easy
and
philosophic
man
of
the
world
had
answered
am
sure
you
mean
what
you
say
but
the
test
of
your
resolution
will
come
whenever
you
shall
meet
the
person
who
pleases
you
at
present
you
laugh
at
them
all
do
not
think
i
shall
ever
care
she
had
said
with
much
accurate
knowledge
of
herself
othmar
momentarily
lava
had
thrown
himself
in
vain
against
this
indifference
the
ice
of
her
temperament
had
not
changed
under
the
volcanic
fires
of
his
all
those
airy
nothings
that
capricious
friendship
that
unrecompensed
position
of
servitude
which
she
offered
him
he
would
have
none
of
and
told
her
so
with
passion
and
force
i
will
have
no
melodramatic
passions
to
disturb
me
she
had
said
are
absurd
they
are
out
of
date
they
are
tiresome
wounded
and
incensed
he
had
taken
her
at
her
word
more
completely
and
instantly
than
she
had
intended
and
she
had
not
known
whether
to
feel
regret
or
relief
she
had
felt
a
good
deal
of
triumph
and
now
he
had
returned
unchanged
in
appearance
handsomer
even
for
that
duskier
hue
which
the
desert
sun
had
left
on
the
marble
of
his
features
and
she
and
he
himself
were
silently
wondering
was
she
glad
he
thought
she
was
annoyed
napraxine
thought
so
too
geraldine
alone
with
a
lover
penetration
felt
that
life
had
grown
sweeter
and
more
stimulating
to
her
that
her
languid
interest
in
existence
had
grown
quicker
of
pulse
and
more
content
with
its
own
atmosphere
since
her
husband
had
read
aloud
the
name
of
othmar
on
the
pencilled
card
perhaps
thought
he
also
with
a
lover
what
he
had
found
in
her
of
indifference
of
disdain
of
lack
of
sympathy
had
been
due
to
the
absence
of
the
sole
person
who
possessed
the
power
to
touch
her
dormant
emotions
in
reality
madame
napraxine
at
that
moment
felt
no
more
than
the
vague
expectation
and
gratification
of
a
spectator
at
a
theatre
who
sees
a
drama
complicate
itself
mingled
with
a
certain
sense
of
curiosity
as
to
why
othmar
sought
to
display
to
her
so
conspicuously
his
escape
from
her
sorcery
she
was
not
mortified
she
was
accustomed
to
change
her
adorers
into
her
friends
and
she
was
of
a
nature
too
integrally
proud
to
be
capable
of
small
things
she
only
wondered
and
doubted
a
little
could
any
one
who
had
loved
her
once
fail
to
love
her
all
his
life
she
thought
not
yet
she
was
not
vain

looks
tempting
in
the
sunshine
said
nadine
napraxine
as
she
rose
and
leaned
on
the
marble
balustrade
to
gaze
over
the
sea
where
the
stately
sailing
yacht
of
geraldine
was
at
anchor
outside
the
little
bay
of
la
jacquemerille
which
was
too
shallow
to
be
entered
will
go
out
in
her
in
ten
minutes
time
i
prefer
to
watch
the
sunset
from
the
sea
and
the
sunset
will
be
very
fine
for
there
are
a
few
clouds
above
the
sky
is
usually
so
terribly
monotonous
here
it
is
like
an
eulogy
of
your
predecessor
at
the
academy
y
a

de
monsignore
i
will
take
you
back
to
nice
by
the
coast
i
dislike
coasting
usually
but
along
this
shore
it
is
pretty
and
besides
it
is
too
late
to
go
far
out
to
sea
lord
geraldine
go
and
give
your
men
the
order
i
will
go
and
change
my
wilkes
you
will
come
geraldine
sullenly
obeyed
and
went
down
the
steps
to
where
his
long
boat
was
still
in
waiting
in
a
very
few
moments
the
princess
napraxine
returned
not
clothed
in
any
maritime
fashion
for
she
thought
that
sort
of
thing
theatrical
foolish
and
staring
but
wearing
a
dark
serge
gown
fitting
with
marvellous
precision
to
the
perfect
contour
and
lines
of
her
form
and
carrying
a
scarlet
parasol
large
enough
to
shelter
the
dignity
of
any
chinese
mandarin
she
wore
yachting
shoes
and
scarlet
stockings
her
feet
like
her
hands
were
such
as
sculptors
dream
of
but
seldom
see
them
to
put
in
my
furs
she
said
to
geraldine
you
ready
it
is
always
so
cold
here
when
the
sun
has
gone
down
we
will
take
count
othmar
and

it
is
a

enough
and
not

much

goes
to
his

i
wonder
he
stayed
to
eat
his
breakfast

of
course
is
at
your
commands
murmured
geraldine
with
myself
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
accompany
the
prince
she
smiled
understanding
his
well
enough
immoral
they
are
she
said
to
melville
de
by
daylight
is
monstrous
but
since
it
is
their
form
of
happiness
muttered
geraldine
between
his
teeth
your
preaching
and
mine
will
not
alter
them
she
continued
is
an
extraordinary
thing
neither
platon
nor
lord
geraldine
cares
a
straw
for
money
neither
of
them
would
awake
a
whit
merrier
if
their
fortunes
were
quadrupled
and
yet
they
find
absolute
intoxication
in
playing
for
money
what
an
inexplicable
anomaly
othmar
is
far
more
consistent
he
despises
his
own
fortune
and
the
table
of
blanc
with
equal
sincerity
do
not
despise
wealth
i
dislike
it
said
othmar
should
you
do
either
said
melville
at
the
immense
potentialities
of
great
riches
is
what
i
said
this
morning
continued
princess
nadine
great
riches
help
one
very
nearly
to
happiness
continued
melville
do
not
mean
from
the
point
of
view
but
simply
because
they
remove
so
many
material
obstacles
in
the
way
of
happiness
there
can
be
hardly
any
great
difficulties
for
a
very
rich
man
he
goes
where
he
chooses
he
can
purchase
whatever
he
desires
there
are
swept
aside
from
his
path
for
ever
all
the
thousand
and
one
annoyances
and
hindrances
which
beset
the
man
who
is
not
rich
only
imagine
a
person
who
can
not
reach
his
dying
child
because
he
has
not
money
enough
for
the
journey
imagine
another
who
has
his
homestead
made
intolerable
to
him
by
the
erection
of
a
and
yet
is
obliged
to
end
his
days
in
it
because
he
can
not
afford
to
move
imagine
yet
another
with
weak
lungs
who
would
recover
his
strength
if
he
could
take
a
house
in
the
country
in
the
south
and
yet
can
not
leave
his
business
which
chains
him
to
a
city
in
the
north
those
are
the
sort
of
sorrows
from
which
wealth
sets
free
a
man
or
a
woman
one
may
say
roughly
i
think
that
if
his
health
be
good
a
very
rich
person
is
exempt
from
all
other
misfortunes
than
those
which
come
to
him
from
his
affections
or
his
friendships
his
troubles
are
in
a
word
entirely
those
of
sentiment
said
nadine
napraxine
seul
être
est
mort
et
tout
est
dépeuplé
murmured
othmar
will
not
allow
or
can
not
comprehend
that
princess
can
imagine
that
a
man
might
fancy
so
for
hours
but
even
if
the
fancy
endure
a
rich
man
can
enjoy
his
desolation
while
a
poor
man
can
not
part
of
the
advantages
of
the
rich
man
consists
in
his
having
the
leisure
and
the
luxury
to
muse
upon
his
own
unhappiness
i
think
you
forget
what
a
great
happiness
that
is
believe
neither
in
love
nor
in
sorrow
said
othmar
abruptly
am
aware
they
exist
if
you
mean
that
she
replied
their
existence
chiefly
depends
upon
the
imagination
othmar
gave
an
impatient
gesture
like
all
pleasures
of
the
imagination
she
added
leisure
for
their
development
the
rich
man
or
woman
enjoys
that
leisure
and
if
he
or
she
like
to
raise
a
gigantic
mushroom
under
glass
in
the
way
of
exaggerated
affections
or
sentimental
regrets
they
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
besides
surely
no
one
can
deny
that
there
is
a
captivating
sense
of
power
in
vast
riches
the
fancy
can
take
endless
flights
in
that
golden
sphere
we
do
not
know
that
delight
because
though
people
think
us
rich
in
reality
we
are
no
such
thing
in
reality
our
expenses
keep
for
ever
ahead
of
our
income
as
i
think
they
do
with
most
people
but
othmar
who
is
actually
positively
fabulously
rich
who
is
all
alone
who
spends
nothing
on
himself
at
least
he
used
to
spend
nothing
why
he
could
build
you
a
cathedral
monsignore
melville
in
every
city
of
the
world
of
jasper

whatever
they
are
and
never
be

poorer
for
doing
it
you
inclined

it
would
make
all
men
like
you
i
should
be
so
said
othmar
i
regret
to
see
that
the
princess
napraxine
has
apparently
retained
only
one
recollection
of
me
and
that
one
is
of
my
wall
of
ingots
as
she
termed
it
which
appears
to
separate
me
from
her
sympathies
you
hear
that
she
said
not
very
well
pleased
though
it
was
not
in
human
power
to
confuse
her
will
let
those
people
go
to
monte
carlo
and
we
will
have
a
run
before
the
wind
and
leave
you
and
monsignore
at
nice
it
is
not
my
own
yacht
it
is
mine
when
i
am
in
it
and
i
invite
you
both
come
othmar
hesitated
till
she
gave
him
a
little
look
one
brief
fleeting
look
two
years
seemed
to
have
fled
away
he
was
again
on
the
staircase
of
the
grand
opéra
she
gave
him
her
fan
to
carry
she
had
on
a
cloak
of
soft
white
feathers
a
gardenia
dropped
out
of
her
bouquet
he
picked
it
up
in
the
whole
glittering
mass
of
paris
he
only
saw
that
one
delicate
face
pale
as
a
narcissus
with
two
wonderful
liquid
eyes
like
night
and
with
a
sort
of
shock
he
recollected
himself
and
realised
that
he
was
standing
on
the
terrace
of
la
jacquemerille
beside
a
woman
whom
he
had
vowed
to
put
out
of
his
life
for
ever
and
aye
said
princess
nadine
and
he
did
not
resist
her
he
followed
in
her
shadow
down
the
flight
of
marble
steps
leading
to
the
sea
while
geraldine
with
a
tempestuous
rage
stifled
in
his
heart
drove
napraxine
who
never
drove
himself
as
furiously
as
russian
horses
can
be
driven
along
the
sunny
road
shaded
with
olives
and
caruba
trees
which
led
from
la
jacquemerille
to
the
paradise
a
few
miles
westward
on
the
shore
boys
sulk
they
should
always
be
punished
thought
the
princess
nadine
with
silent
diversion
as
she
heard
the
plunge
and
rush
of
the
horses
on
the
other
side
of
the
gardens
and
divined
that
their
driver
was
already
repenting
of
the
moment
of
petulance
and
of
jealousy
in
which
he
had
exiled
himself
from
her
presence
and
condemned
himself
to
the
society
of
her
lord
platon
is
the
dullest
of
companions
and
geraldine
thinks
it
son
to
detest
him
and
yet
he
goes
with
him
by
way
of
showing
his
pique
against
othmar
how
stupid
how
intensely
stupid
she
thought
with
exceeding
amusement
to
herself
as
she
descended
the
and
stepped
into
geraldine
boat
it
was
droll
to
her
that
anybody
should
either
detest
or
envy
her
husband
he
was
so
infinitesimally
little
in
her
own
life
she
readily
did
justice
to
his
good
humour
his
loyalty
his
courage
and
his
honesty
but
those
qualities
were
all
obscured
by
his
dulness
and
heaviness
and
also
by
the
simple
fact
that
he
was
her
husband
as
the
good
points
in
a
landscape
are
blotted
out
by
a
fog
virtues
all
of
them
she
called
them
with
a
mixture
of
esteem
and
impatience
of
appreciation
and
contempt
the
boat
glided
through
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
blue
water
and
brought
them
to
the
side
of
geraldine
yacht
a
beautiful
schooner
with
canvas
white
as
foam
and
flying
the
pennon
of
cowes
poor
berenice
was
once
as
elegant
and
spotless
as
this
said
othmar
she
has
been
through
sore
stress
of
weather
her
sails
are
rags
her
sides
are
battered
her
rudder
is
gone
she
made
a
sorry
spectacle
when
we
hove
to
last
night
but
i
am
attached
to
her
i
shall
not
buy
another
yacht
always
take
things
so
seriously
said
princess
nadine
yacht
is
a
toy
like
any
other
when
one
is
broken
get
another
why
should
you
be
attached
to
a
thing
of
teak
and
copper
has
served
me
well
he
said
simply
do
not
understand
attachment
of
any
kind
princess
is
only
an
amiable
form
of
prejudice
certainly
i
do
not
understand
why
you
should
be
attached
to
a
thing
made
of
wood
and
metal
to
a
thing
made
of
flesh
and
blood
i
believe
that
is
equally
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
madame
napraxine
said
othmar
with
some
bitterness
i
ask
how
are
your
children
he
added
after
a
pause
two
ugly
little
boys
oh
quite
well
they
are
never
anything
else
they
are
as
strong
as
ponies
they
are
ugly
they
have
the
tartar
face
which
is
the
ugliest
in
europe
they
are
so
like
platon
that
it
is
quite
absurd
othmar
was
silent
the
words
did
not
seem
to
him
in
her
usual
perfectly
good
taste
they
did
not
accord
with
the
delicate
face
of
their
speaker
remember
that
you
never
cared
for
your
children
he
said
and
added
after
a
pause
for
anything
that
had
the
misfortune
to
love
you
do
not
think
the
children
love
me
at
all
she
said
with
a
smile
should
they
their
father
they
adore
because
he
adores
them
it
is
always
pro
in
any
love
always
said
othmar
curtly
you
love
me
still
thought
princess
nadine
without
astonishment
aloud
she
said
must
be
or
the
thing
is
absurd
it
dies
a
natural
death
or
rather
is
starved
to
death
nothing
has
any
strength
think
you
have
seen
many
living
proofs
to
the
contrary
he
answered
pride
may
strangle
a
love
which
is
not
shared
it
is
a
violent
death
but
a
sure
one
will
men
always
talk
of
love
she
said
with
some
impatience
all
how
little
place
it
takes
up
in
real
life
ambition
society
amusement
politics
a
hundred
things
take
up
a
hundredfold
more
space
is
not
to
every
one
the
unnecessary
molecule
that
it
is
to
madame
napraxine
said
othmar
have
seen
a
glass
of
water
touched
by
a
single
drop
of
quinine
it
is
only
a
drop
but
it
embitters
the
whole
glassful
so
do
the
attachments
of
life
embitter
it
you
put
the
drop
in
no
doubt
said
princess
napraxine
drily
if
some
one
else
put
it
in
muttered
othmar
one
knows
what
one
drinks
one
must
never
let
others
meddle
with
one
even
in
drinking
a
glass
of
water
replied
his
tormentor
she
knew
very
well
that
he
meant
to
reproach
her
but
she
bore
the
reproach
lightly
if
the
remembrance
of
her
embittered
any
man
existence
it
was
not
her
fault
it
was
the
fault
of
those
who
would
not
be
content
with
adoring
her
as
the
poor
people
of
this
adored
their
madonna
shut
away
behind
a
glass
case
the
way
othmar
have
you
not
a
villa
here
she
said
suddenly
remembering
the
fact
believe
you
have
five
hundred
and
houses
altogether
have
you
not
is
there
not
some
place
near
nice
that
belongs
to
you
pharamond
yes
it
is
where
i
slept
last
night
my
father
bought
some
olive
and
pine
wood
and
built
the
house
in
the
midst
of
them
it
has
a
fine
view
seaward
we
shall
be
neighbours
i
do
not
go
to
paris
course
you
will
go
to
paris
but
you
will
go
one
day
and
come
back
another
like
everybody
else
at
this
season
though
to
be
sure
i
dare
say
you
are
longing
for
the
smell
of
the
asphalte
after
a
cycle
of
cathay
the
asphalte
is
not
necessary
to
me
it
is
more
monotonous
on
the
whole
than
the
desert
you
were
never
a
parisien
you
were
always
in
revolt
against
something
or
another
though
one
never
could
understand
very
well
what
when
you
condescended
to
our
amusements
it
was
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
to
please
a
child
plays
with
tin
soldiers
that
sort
of
air
of
contemptuous
condescension
has
made
you
many
enemies
there
is
nothing
makes
the
world
so
angry
as
indifference
to
what
it
thinks
delightful
have
offended
it
in
that
way
yourself
princess
but
not
quite
with
your
insolence
a
man
who
prefers
his
library
to
the
clubs
is
beyond
all
pardon
and
besides
i
am
seen
everywhere
where
it
is
worth
while
to
be
seen
you
are
or
were
generally
conspicuous
by
your
absence
imagine
the
world
has
grown
as
indifferent
to
me
as
i
am
to
it
and
having
forgotten
has
so
forgiven
me
i
have
been
away
eighteen
months
world
never
forgets
its
rich
men
my
dear
othmar
it
may
forget
its
great
ones
will
forget
them
indeed
unless
they
have
a
drum
beaten
very
loudly
before
them
you
might
be
great
i
think
if
you
liked
you
have
so
many
talents
so
much
power
might
buy
a
kingdom
the
size
of
morocco
or
montenegro
very
likely
such
sovereignty
does
not
attract
me
course
i
do
not
mean
that
you
do
not
want
to
be
a
prince
floristan
you
do
not
love
the
race
of
princes
well
enough
but
were
i
you
i
should
set
some
great
ambition
before
me
me
you
would
do
no
such
thing
if
you
were
in
my
position
you
would
feel
as
i
feel
the
numbing
influence
of
what
you
called
just
now
the
blank
wall
of
ingots
when
you
can
buy
men
you
do
not
estimate
them
highly
enough
either
to
serve
or
rule
them
i
have
all
i
can
possibly
want
materially
i
have
no
reason
to
seek
anything
do
english
nobles
enter
public
life
they
want
nothing
materially
either
some
of
them
are
of
rank
also
so
high
in
place
that
nothing
can
be
added
to
their
position
knows
why
they
do
said
othmar
that
i
think
the
englishman
is
an
animal
like
the
beaver
not
happy
without
work
besides
i
think
they
imagine
that
they
serve
their
country
a
delusion
but
an
honourable
one
which
must
make
them
very
happy
as
i
have
no
country
i
can
not
be
attached
to
it
could
choose
one
you
are
allied
to
several
would
not
be
the
same
thing
to
adore
the
motherland
one
must
have
known
no
arms
no
hearts
but
hers
no
country
is
more
than
a
stepmother
to
me
are
a
very
much
envied
man
othmar
but
you
are
not
a
happy
man
he
looked
her
straight
in
the
eyes
have
been
unhappy
but
i
have
conquered
my
folly
it
is
ingratitude
to
fate
to
be
wretched
while
one
has
health
and
strength
and
no
material
cares
to
contend
with
the
same
you
are
not
happy
now
she
thought
but
she
said
with
her
sweetest
smile
admit
that
you
have
all
you
want
materially
all
the
rest
is
a
dream
not
worth
keeping
awake
about
for
one
hour
by
the
way
as
you
speak
of
countries
you
are
french
now
by
law
i
think
grandfather
was
naturalised
for
his
own
interests
as
you
know
but
our
people
were
croat
peasants
know
i
have
heard
you
always
say
so
but
i
believe
it
is
a
fable
do
not
come
from
any
peasantry
besides
surely
sclavonia
is
old
enough
and
dim
enough
to
give
you
any
mystical
heroic
ancestry
you
may
prefer
might
be
robbers
said
othmar
do
not
know
there
is
not
much
to
choose
who
is
noble
comes
from
robbers
of
some
sort
said
princess
napraxine
were
the
hohenstauffen
the
hohenzollern
the
habsburg
the
grimaldi
the
montefeltro
the
colonna
robbers
all
sitting
on
high
in
their
fortresses
and
swooping
down
like
hawks
on
the
fords
on
the
highways
on
the
moorlands
on
the
forests
on
the
little
towns
below
them
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
is
what
your
people
did
in
croatia
are
very
kind
to
try
and
console
me
said
othmar
i
think
consists
in
being
able
to
trace
the
past
of
your
forefathers
and
to
have
your
charters
the
past
of
mine
is
lost
in
darkness
and
my
charters
are
lost
with
them
truthfully
we
can
only
date
from
when
marc
othmar
who
dealt
in
horses
began
to
lend
money
in
agram
it
is
not
a
lofty
beginning
it
is
not
even
a
creditable
one
but
i
do
not
think
that
to
pretend
that
marc
othmar
the
horse
dealer
or
horse
stealer
was
a
hero
and
saint
would
mend
matters
i
accept
him
as
what
he
was
but
i
can
not
be
proud
of
him
even
sometimes
i
am
on
the
eve
of
cursing
him
at
all
events
of
wishing
he
had
never
existed
dear
othmar
you
are
very
strange
sometimes
i
one
is
never
content
with
what
one
has
there
is
nothing
strange
in
that
if
you
will
deign
to
remember
me
at
all
you
will
remember
that
i
was
never
pleased
with
being
the
head
of
the
house
of
othmar
i
would
give
all
its
millions
for
an
unblemished
descent
you
are
ungrateful
to
your
fortunes
and
do
not
understand
your
own
times
i
understand
them
too
well
and
that
is
why
i
despise
what
they
yourself
what
they
have
found
worth
but
little
look
at
most
of
our
contemporaries
and
associates
have
their
unblemished
names
served
them
in
much
how
many
have
remembered
that
how
many
of
them
ally
themselves
with
the
mud
of
the
earth
for
the
sake
of
large
dowries
how
many
mortgage
their
old
lands
till
they
have
not
a
sod
left
which
they
can
call
their
own
how
many
waste
all
their
energies
and
all
their
health
in
a
routine
of
miserable
and
stupid
follies
which
are
hardly
even
to
be
dignified
as
vice
she
spoke
with
animation
her
cheeks
had
a
faint
flush
delicate
as
that
of
the
waxen
bells
of
the
begonia
flowers
her
eyes
were
full
of
light
othmar
looked
at
her
with
a
passion
of
regret
if
only
she
had
loved
him
he
thought
he
could
have
conquered
the
world
have
renewed
the
impossibilities
of
alexander
have
done
all
that
visionary
boys
dream
of
doing
as
they
read
their
euripides
or
their
æschylus
in
a
summer
noon
under
blossoming
lime
trees
will
take
from
rome
what
you
yourself
have
carried
there
says
a
german
writer
and
it
is
with
love
the
same
thing
you
take
from
it
what
you
carry
to
it
you
get
out
of
it
so
much
spirituality
and
no
more
than
you
bear
thereto
to
others
nadine
napraxine
was
a
coquette
a
a
mere
of
the
elegant
world
but
to
him
she
was
the
one
woman
of
the
earth
she
could
have
inspired
him
with
any
heroism
she
could
have
moved
him
to
any
sacrifice
she
could
have
compensated
him
for
any
loss
he
saw
in
her
a
million
possibilities
which
no
one
ever
saw
which
might
be
only
the
fruits
of
his
imagination
but
yet
were
wholly
real
to
him
unspeakably
lovely
and
attractive
she
had
offended
him
alienated
him
treated
his
ardour
and
his
earnestness
as
a
baby
treats
its
toys
and
his
reason
condemned
her
inexorably
and
often
yet
she
was
the
one
woman
on
earth
for
him
and
he
had
tried
to
hate
her
to
drive
her
out
of
his
memory
and
had
thought
that
he
succeeded
and
had
only
failed
you
were
like
other
men
of
your
generation
she
pursued
would
be
much
more
content
you
do
not
care
for
any
of
the
things
which
fill
up
their
time
you
have
magnificent
horses
but
you
never
race
with
them
you
never
even
hunt
you
care
nothing
for
cards
or
for
any
games
of
hazard
you
do
not
shoot
except
as
you
justly
observed
a
now
and
then
when
he
provokes
you
you
do
not
care
to
have
yourself
talked
about
which
is
the
supreme
felicity
of
the
age
you
live
in
your
solitary
extravagance
is
to
have
operas
and
concerts
given
in
your
own
houses
with
closed
doors
like
ludwig
of
bavaria
and
that
seems
rather
an
eccentricity
than
an
extravagance
to
the
world
at
large
you
are
a
great
student
but
you
care
about
the
contents
of
your
books
not
about
the
binding
or
the
date
of
their
edition
so
that
you
never
commit
the
follies
of
a
bibliophile
you
do
not
care
about
any
of
your
fine
places
you
have
an
idea
that
you
would
like
a
cottage
just
because
you
are
tired
of
palaces
you
vex
women
by
your
indifference
to
their
attractions
and
men
by
your
indifference
to
their
pursuits
because
circumstance
has
made
you
a
conspicuous
person
with
an
electric
light
always
upon
you
you
sigh
to
be
an
with
no
light
on
you
at
all
except
that
of
your
own
hearth
it
is
louis
seize
and
the
locksmith
domitian
and
the
honorius
and
the
hens
over
again
history
always
repeats
itself
and
how
one
wishes
that
it
did
not
am
flattered
madame
that
you
deign
to
draw
my
portrait
since
it
shows
that
you
have
not
wholly
forgotten
my
features
said
othmar
with
some
bitterness
present
i
have
not
discovered
the
hen
the
cabbages
or
the
keys
that
will
make
life
worth
living
to
me
no
doubt
the
fault
lies
with
myself
think
you
have
not
the
dramatic
instinct
which
alone
makes
life
interesting
replied
nadine
napraxine
do
not
divert
yourself
with
the
faults
the
follies
and
the
meannesses
of
men
you
sigh
over
them
and
your
regret
is
so
poignant
that
it
prevents
your
seeing
how
infinitely
droll
their
blunders
are
in
reality
think
she
continued
there
are
only
two
ways
of
looking
on
life
which
make
it
interesting
or
even
endurable
the
one
is
the
way
of
corot
which
adores
nature
and
can
find
an
absolute
ecstasy
in
the
sound
of
the
wind
and
the
play
of
the
sunshine
and
asks
nothing
more
of
fate
than
a
and
a
handful
of
green
leaves
the
other
is
the
way
of
rochefoucauld
and
of
simon
which
finds
infinite
and
unending
diversion
in
watching
the
feebleness
and
the
mistakes
of
human
nature
which
regards
the
world
with
what
i
call
the
dramatic
instinct
and
amuses
itself
endlessly
with
the
attitudes
and
genuflections
of
its
courtiers
the
false
phrases
and
the
balked
calculations
now
though
you
are
a
very
clever
man
my
dear
othmar
you
can
not
be
put
in
either
of
these
categories
you
know
too
much
of
the
world
for
the
first
and
you
have
too
much
softness
of
heart
for
the
second
now
were
you
like
baron
fritz
uncle
is
the
one
perfectly
happy
man
that
i
have
ever
known
replied
othmar
is
because
he
is
the
most
perfect
of
egotists
according
to
him
the
sun
shines
only
for
the
othmar
as
joshua
fancied
it
only
shone
for
the
israelites
is
not
only
that
she
said
is
because
he
has
the
dramatic
instinct
he
sees
the
dramatic
side
to
all
that
he
does
suppliant
monarchs
bankrupt
statesmen
intriguing
diplomatists
men
who
carry
him
schemes
to
tunnel
the
earth
from
pole
to
pole
and
great
ladies
who
want
him
to
lend
them
money
on
their
family
diamonds
they
are
all
so
many
comedians
in
the
eyes
of
baron
fritz
he
pulls
their
strings
and
makes
them
dance
at
his
pleasure
i
quite
understand
how
the
whole
comedy
amuses
him
so
greatly
that
he
can
never
be
conscious
of
a
moment
of
it
is
a
great
pity
that
you
are
not
like
that
you
would
leave
such
witty
memoirs
for
you
can
be
witty
or
you
would
be
if
you
were
not
always
so
melancholy
regret
madame
said
othmar
i
can
not
alter
the
manner
of
my
life
even
to
have
the
honour
of
amusing
you
after
my
death
across
the
bows
of
the
at
that
moment
there
passed
perilously
near
one
of
the
boats
so
common
on
the
coast
with
their
freights
of
fruits
of
fish
of
olives
or
of
market
produce
the
boat
was
full
of
lemons
and
of
oranges
which
gleamed
like
virgin
gold
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
the
tranquil
afternoon
a
peasant
woman
was
managing
the
sail
a
young
girl
was
steering
a
beautiful
face
said
nadine
napraxine
who
had
a
great
love
of
beauty
and
the
frank
acknowledgment
of
it
of
a
woman
high
above
all
possibilities
of
envy
othmar
looked
where
she
pointed
very
lovely
face
he
said
indifferently
does
not
look
like
a
peasant
continued
mme
napraxine
little
grey
gown
speaks
of
some
convent
she
steers
well
for
they
were
terribly
near
who
is
that
very
pretty
child
monsignore
i
suppose
you
know
all
the
flock
of
which
you
are
given
the
winter
shepherding
do
not
make
me
responsible
for
all
the
black
sheep
of
these
shores
said
melville
drawing
near
and
looking
at
the
boat
which
was
going
slowly
and
heavily
against
the
wind
and
labouring
under
a
weighty
load
he
said
as
he
did
so
with
a
little
surprise
that
is
yseulte
de
valogne
de
valogne
what
a
name
of
the
romaunt
de
la
rose
and
chronicles
pray
who
may
she
be
may
i
ask
call
her
here
cendrillon
said
melville
a
little
sadly
for
her
name
the
de
valogne
belong
to
french
history
surely
you
remember
to
have
heard
of
some
of
them
aymar
who
fell
at
the
combat
of
the
thirty
and
adhémar
who
was
constable
of
france
under
louis
xii
and
maximin
who
was
a
general
under
condé
and
gui
who
was
ruined
by
his
display
at
versailles
a
colonel
of
the
guard
and
a
great
officer
of
state
the
family
is
as
historic
as
the
louvre
itself
but
the
poor
child
is
literally
le
that
she
is
reduced
to
sell
oranges
said
nadine
very
touching
othmar
will
purchase
immediately
several
bales
she
does
not
sell
oranges
said
melville
perhaps
she
is
more
to
be
pitied
than
those
who
do
a
great
name
and
no
dower
it
is
to
have
silver
bells
to
your
shoes
but
no
stockings
inside
them
she
must
have
stockings
i
mean
relations
very
distant
ones
she
is
a
cousin
of
your
friend
and
neighbour
the
duchesse
de
vannes
who
brings
her
up
that
is
sends
her
to
her
convent
pays
for
her
frocks
and
allows
her
to
pass
her
holidays
at
one
of
de
vannes
i
do
not
know
that
we
could
reasonably
expect
the
duchesse
to
do
more
only
there
are
two
ways
of
doing
a
thing
and
she
does
not
do
this
in
the
best
possible
manner
can
not
love
a
very
pretty
girl
of
sixteen
it
would
not
be
in
nature
certainly
not
in
her
nature
said
the
princess
with
one
of
her
moments
of
frankness
imagine
they
will
make
her
embrace
the
religious
life
what
else
can
they
do
with
her
is
what
they
will
probably
end
with
said
melville
with
a
tinge
of
sadness
is
hard
for
a
girl
of
noble
blood
and
no
dower
to
end
otherwise
in
france
the
men
who
ought
to
marry
her
her
equals
will
marry
instead
some
americans
with
dollars
whose
fathers
were
stokers
or
are
there
no
other
de
valogne
she
is
the
last
of
a
family
which
was
as
extravagant
as
it
was
distinguished
othmar
may
have
heard
of
her
father
the
last
comte
de
valogne
he
was
a
and
finished
the
little
that
had
been
left
by
count
gui
the
hero
of
versailles
and
the
fortune
of
his
wife
as
well
who
was
a
de
creusac
she
died
in
childbed
her
mother
had
the
care
of
the
child
and
he
went
on
with
his
life
of
pleasure
until
he
broke
his
neck
riding
at
la
marche
the
old
marquise
de
creusac
when
she
also
died
could
not
leave
her
granddaughter
a
farthing
the
de
creusac
had
been
ruined
in
the
revolution
and
the
sons
of
the
marquise
who
would
never
have
anything
to
do
with
their
were
both
killed
in
the
war
of
there
was
no
one
left
but
the
duchesse
de
vannes
who
was
a
third
cousin
of
de
valogne
to
do
anything
she
took
the
child
in
her
charge
as
i
have
said
and
has
behaved
admirably
in
the
letter
of
charity
if
something
has
been
lacking
of
the
spirit
so
long
as
the
girl
is
being
educated
the
thing
is
easy
but
when
the
time
comes
when
she
must
leave
her
convent
as
she
will
have
to
do
in
two
years
time
the
problem
will
not
be
so
easy
of
solution
they
will
have
to
decide
on
her
future
at
present
her
fate
has
been
easily
settled
but
soon
the
terrible
question
will
arise
who
will
marry
her
without
a
dower
i
believe
they
mean
to
make
her
enter
the
religious
life
as
you
said
for
the
men
who
probably
would
marry
her
for
sake
of
alliance
with
the
de
vannes
will
be
those
with
whom
the
de
vannes
would
utterly
refuse
to
ally
themselves
convent
good
heavens
for
a
child
like
a
greuze
picture
exclaimed
othmar
melville
added
sadly
is
a
refuge
but
myself
i
would
never
have
the
religious
life
embraced
only
for
its
safety
i
never
approve
of
looking
at
deity
as
a
superior
sort
of
chaperon
if
all
the
soul
be
not
aspirant
of
its
own
accord
to
a
spiritual
sacrifice
the
vows
are
a
mere
shibboleth
soul
shrined
in
a
healthy
body
would
aspire
to
the
cloister
at
sixteen
thought
othmar
as
the
princess
said
this
is
very
interesting
monsignore
but
it
does
not
explain
how
a
of
my
neighbours
the
high
and
mighty
de
vannes
comes
to
be
rowing
in
a
boat
full
of
oranges
that
i
can
not
tell
you
said
melville
i
believe
her
has
a
near
nice
it
may
be
she
is
with
her
now
i
knew
her
well
when
she
was
a
little
child
living
with
the
old
marquise
de
creusac
in
that
extreme
but
refined
and
reserved
poverty
of
which
only
the
old
noblesse
has
the
secret
the
marquise
was
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
pious
women
i
have
ever
had
the
honour
to
know
but
she
could
if
necessary
have
withered
a
king
into
the
earth
with
a
glance
the
child
promised
to
be
like
her
but
had
something
and
impetuous
which
had
come
to
her
from
her
father
and
which
beneath
her
manner
and
her
chastened
tone
made
her
as
a
baby
intensely
interesting
monsignore
said
the
princess
with
a
little
impatience
you
have
mistaken
your
vocation
and
should
have
been
a
writer
of
novels
you
draw
portraits
with
the
skill
of
octave
feuillet
have
only
said
what
i
have
seen
said
melville
feuillet
only
does
the
same
the
boat
with
the
oranges
had
passed
ahead
towards
the
shore
its
venetian
red
side
was
dipping
in
the
trough
of
the
waves
its
old
striped
sail
was
swaying
in
the
wind
there
was
a
speck
of
gold
in
the
sun
where
the
oranges
were
had
better
rescue
this
distressed
damsel
and
marry
her
othmar
said
the
princess
napraxine
with
an
unkind
little
laugh
seems
made
on
purpose
for
you
she
has
the
unsullied
descent
which
you
are
always
sighing
for
and
you
certainly
can
dispense
with
a
for
answer
he
only
looked
at
her
but
she
understood
his
answer
melville
vaguely
understood
also
that
in
his
innocent
praises
of
his
cinderella
he
had
unwittingly
struck
a
false
chord
and
he
was
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
not
to
be
grieved
at
his
involuntary
failure
in
tact
the
boat
meanwhile
was
fast
growing
to
a
mere
speck
of
red
and
yellow
colour
soon
to
be
wholly
lost
in
the
blue
radiance
of
sea
and
sky
have
at
times
bought
some
greuzes
if
i
remember
continued
the
princess
are
pretty
soft
conventional
but
i
do
not
know
that
your
gallery
is
much
the
richer
for
them
belong
to
another
time
than
ours
said
othmar
imagine
talleyrand
was
right
when
he
said
that
no
one
born
since
can
know
how
sweet
human
life
can
become
how
elegant
human
manners
can
be
added
melville
has
something
of
that
old
grace
when
she
was
two
years
old
she
curtseyed
as
though
she
were
sevigné
self
a
paragon
said
madame
napraxine
and
all
the
graces
an
irresistible
combination
the
time
i
should
have
liked
to
live
in
would
have
been
louis
treize
what
perfect
costume
what
picturesque
wars
what
admirable
architecture
is
this
child
at
sacré
coeur
did
you
say
monsignore
would
be
too
extravagant
for
her
place
as
cendrillon
replied
melville
i
think
they
were
wise
not
to
put
her
amidst
all
those
great
ladies
in
embryo
she
has
been
educated
by
the
dames
de
ste
anne
at
a
remote
village
called
faiël
in
the
morbihan
she
has
had
a
pale
girlhood
there
like
the
that
blossoms
under
the
oaks
poetic
you
are
said
the
princess
napraxine
with
a
smile
which
brought
a
flush
of
embarrassment
even
to
the
cheek
of
melville
are
so
much
more
romantic
than
women
here
are
clotilde
de
vannes
and
i
who
only
see
that
as
this
young
girl
has
no
dower
the
very
best
place
for
her
in
the
world
is
a
convent
melancholy
but
inevitable
whereas
you
and
othmar
merely
because
she
has
pretty
hair
which
the
sun
shines
on
as
she
goes
past
amongst
her
oranges
are
already
thinking
that
some
one
ought
to
rise
out
of
the
sea
to
marry
her
with
a
duke
in
one
hand
and
a
veil
of
old
lace
in
the
other
certainly
those
things
do
happen
if
she
were
an
impudent
at
hengler
or
a
californian
who
never
had
a
grandfather
the
duke
would
no
doubt
appear
on
her
horizon
by
the
way
pending
her
eternal
retreat
does
allow
her
to
be
seen
at
all
will
probably
see
her
at
millo
i
saw
her
there
last
week
and
made
her
cry
by
reminding
her
of
her
babyhood
on
the
isle
and
of
her
grandmother
whom
she
adored
she
is
with
the
duchesse
now
because
there
is
typhus
fever
at
the
convent
and
the
pupils
are
all
dispersed
but
millo
is
scarcely
a
congenial
air
for
a
poor
relation
who
is
also
a
proud
one
she
is
a
good
advertisement
of
virtues
en
a
said
the
princess
napraxine
with
her
merciless
little
laugh
de
vannes
what
does
he
say
to
so
pretty
a
relative
man
like
de
vannes
never
sees
that
a
young
girl
of
that
type
exists
m
mph
she
murmured
dubiously
depends
on
a
great
many
circumstances
propinquity
and
will
make
ste
scholastique
herself
sought
like
the
krauss
or
jeanne
granier
millo
is
certainly
a
very
odd
kind
of
home
for
your
woodland
if
she
have
any
intelligence
at
all
and
relate
what
she
sees
when
she
gets
back
to
faiël
the
good
dames
de
ste
anne
will
have
the
monastic
enjoyment
of
scandal
gratified
to
the
uttermost
believe
she
lives
entirely
in
the
schoolroom
whilst
at
millo
said
melville
a
little
impatiently
he
wished
he
had
never
spoken
the
name
of
yseulte
de
valogne
the
name
which
seemed
to
belong
to
temps
quand
la
reine
berthe
he
had
one
of
those
instincts
of
having
spoken
unwisely
one
of
those
presentiments
of
impending
disaster
which
come
to
finely
organised
and
minds
and
are
called
by
blunter
and
slower
brains
mere
nervous
nonsense
when
the
other
day
the
tall
factory
chimney
fell
at
bradford
the
birds
which
built
in
it
had
flown
away
before
the
workmen
stupidly
eating
their
breakfasts
till
the
bricks
tumbled
about
their
ears
had
looked
up
and
seen
any
danger
chapter
as
othmar
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
yacht
and
let
his
eyes
dwell
on
her
face
unseen
by
him
so
long
his
regard
let
something
of
the
emotion
which
he
felt
escape
him
and
betrayed
that
the
chill
indifference
with
which
he
had
met
her
again
had
been
but
the
mere
mask
of
pride
though
it
might
be
a
mask
which
he
would
be
strong
enough
always
to
wear
in
her
presence
is
pharamond
he
said
conscious
of
his
momentary
loss
of
as
he
pointed
to
some
round
towers
which
rose
above
woods
of
ilex
trees
and
magnolias
you
would
allow
them
to
land
me
there
instead
of
at
nice
i
should
be
grateful
and
perhaps
you
would
honour
me
with
landing
too
the
house
is
somewhat
neglected
as
i
have
been
away
so
long
but
they
will
be
at
least
able
to
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
pleasure
if
wilkes
likes
it
said
the
princess
as
she
joined
her
friend
never
knew
you
had
a
place
upon
this
coast
surely
you
never
named
it
when
when
i
knew
you
first
likely
not
said
othmar
have
been
seldom
there
it
was
a
favourite
house
of
my
father
in
his
rare
moments
of
leisure
but
i
have
never
cared
for
the
air
or
for
the
world
of
nice
i
have
lent
it
sometimes
to
my
friends
do
you
not
lend
to
your
friends
in
that
respect
you
have
made
yourself
honey
and
the
flies
have
eaten
you
without
hesitation
the
honey
be
not
in
the
hive
it
ought
to
be
eaten
there
is
a
in
my
grounds
and
the
house
is
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
if
such
a
distance
do
not
alarm
you
i
know
that
you
are
no
great
pedestrian
princess
should
one
be
when
there
are
so
many
more
agreeable
modes
of
progression
ne
doit
jamais
se
punir
pour
have
walked
twenty
miles
for
my
own
pleasure
very
often
said
lady
brancepeth
who
approached
them
but
you
are
english
we
were
just
saying
that
all
english
people
are
like
beavers
you
must
be
sawing
and
drilling
and
building
and
dragging
something
or
other
all
through
the
length
of
your
days
i
could
walk
i
think
i
could
walk
right
across
russia
if
there
were
any
wise
object
to
be
obtained
by
it
but
simply
to
walk
as
a
mad
dog
runs
from
a
sort
of
blind
impulsion
no
that
is
beyond
me
are
such
a
curious
union
nadine
of
languor
and
energy
of
indifference
and
of
potentialities
began
her
friend
energy
is
latent
she
said
interrupting
her
do
not
waste
it
on
trifles
as
you
waste
yours
you
always
use
power
to
boil
an
egg
or
make
a
box
of
wax
matches
that
is
an
english
idea
of
energy
grandmother
the
princesse
was
english
by
birth
was
othmar
mother
that
is
why
he
and
i
have
something
of
the
beaver
in
us
but
calmed
controlled
kept
in
reserve
we
do
not
waste
our
time
and
timber
damming
up
threads
of
water
but
we
shall
be
ready
if
an
inundation
occur
perhaps
said
lady
brancepeth
have
a
great
deal
more
energy
than
he
said
nadine
napraxine
with
a
smile
as
she
leaned
back
in
the
wicker
looking
as
indolent
as
a
turkish
woman
and
as
delicate
and
useless
as
a
painted
butterfly
the
schooner
in
twenty
minutes
time
landed
them
at
a
creek
with
a
little
marble
quay
shadowed
by
great
pines
and
eucalyptus
trees
there
was
a
pavilion
on
the
small
pier
a
pretty
kiosque
all
white
and
blue
and
gold
with
twisted
pillars
and
moorish
arabesques
nothing
here
is
of
my
taste
or
choice
said
othmar
have
not
been
at
the
place
for
ten
years
would
you
like
to
rest
they
can
bring
your
tea
to
you
or
would
you
come
up
to
the
house
at
once
pour
le
said
nadine
napraxine
never
care
for
the
preface
of
a
story
fear
you
will
find
it
a
dull
story
said
he
as
they
left
the
quay
and
passed
up
a
steep
path
always
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
a
misfortune
for
him
that
he
inherited
so
much
it
prevents
him
enjoying
any
thing
she
said
to
melville
who
replied
a
little
drily
do
not
think
it
is
what
he
inherited
which
prevents
his
enjoyment
princess
it
is
more
probably
what
he
encountered
and
sighed
for
vainly
life
holds
many
of
these
ironies
i
were
he
she
continued
ignoring
the
reply
should
care
for
nothing
but
that
power
which
he
in
common
with
other
great
capitalists
possesses
to
be
able
to
make
a
war
possible
or
impossible
by
the
mere
inclining
of
your
wand
of
gold
that
must
be
the
most
interesting
of
all
possible
kinds
of
influence
the
financier
is
the
modern
merlin
but
then
there
is
vivien
tennyson
poem
not
out
of
it
said
princess
nadine
sceptically
but
she
knew
very
well
that
vivien
was
then
walking
under
the
shade
of
her
own
great
red
parasol
with
its
group
of
embroidered
on
its
left
side
the
pathway
ascended
steeply
through
the
woods
bordered
with
datura
and
geranium
which
were
still
blossoming
gaily
here
and
there
was
a
wooden
bench
a
majolica
seat
a
little
statue
the
ground
was
of
shining
shingle
it
had
been
kept
in
perfect
order
awaiting
its
owner
for
ten
years
after
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
it
ended
on
a
level
space
of
the
red
rock
up
which
it
had
climbed
here
had
been
laid
out
a
and
fantastic
garden
lawns
palms
fountains
walls
of
shrubs
and
groves
of
camellias
and
azaleas
spreading
before
a
château
which
was
in
architecture
a
miniature
maintenon
and
in
position
stood
high
enough
to
look
over
the
sea
in
front
of
it
a
delicious
place
said
nadine
in
a
month
or
two
when
all
those
azaleas
flower
if
i
had
known
you
had
owned
such
a
bijou
i
would
have
told
you
to
lend
it
to
us
it
makes
la
jacquemerille
a
mere
trumpery
toy
would
lend
you
nothing
said
othmar
in
her
ear
would
have
given
you
everything
once
then
he
added
aloud
is
somewhat
trumpery
also
i
fear
modern
things
are
so
apt
to
have
that
look
they
are
like
the
de
which
cost
enormously
but
are
only
plush
and
ormolu
after
all
however
viollet
le
duc
built
this
house
so
it
may
be
a
little
better
than
its
neighbours
only
i
should
like
statelier
and
simpler
gardens
myself
i
should
like
high
box
hedges
and
plants
but
i
suppose
they
would
not
go
with
the
mediterranean
like
anything
simple
and
homely
you
will
have
to
marry
margot
or
phoebe
or
grethel
off
a
farm
said
the
princess
with
some
contempt
she
was
a
hothouse
flower
herself
and
despised
thyme
and
might
do
worse
said
othmar
as
he
ushered
them
into
the
house
which
contained
some
wonderful
china
some
admirable
modern
pictures
some
fine
statuary
and
more
french
luxury
than
its
master
cared
to
have
surround
him
is
exquisite
said
the
princess
after
wandering
through
it
and
returning
to
a
room
opening
on
the
gardens
a
room
hung
with
tawny
plush
embroidered
with
white
roses
and
blue
irises
the
chairs
and
couches
matched
the
walls
a
gilt
cornice
ran
round
the
oval
ceiling
which
was
painted
with
the
story
of
undine
many
more
houses
have
you
othmar
standing
like
so
many
open
empty
caskets
waiting
for
you
to
put
the
jewel
of
life
into
them
really
how
many
have
you
come
tell
me
have
too
many
said
othmar
excess
always
carries
its
own
retribution
amongst
them
all
i
have
no
home
none
that
i
feel
i
can
imagine
what
it
is
a
that
one
cares
about
and
desires
to
return
to
but
i
do
not
possess
it
it
said
melville
is
always
in
the
power
of
every
man
who
is
not
a
priest
suppose
it
is
said
othmar
it
has
never
seemed
very
easy
to
me
the
fire
of
the
hearth
is
like
the
coal
from
the
altar
it
comes
from
heaven
and
can
scarcely
be
commanded
he
glanced
as
he
spoke
at
nadine
napraxine
who
was
lying
back
against
the
golden
gleams
of
the
plush
of
her
couch
she
had
a
in
her
hand
which
she
had
plucked
from
the
gardens
she
looked
and
ethereal
she
had
on
her
lips
that
little
smile
which
meant
so
much
and
yet
said
nothing
and
was
half
compassion
and
half
disdain
and
partially
also
amusement
if
she
had
been
mistress
here
and
in
all
his
other
houses
he
thought
each
one
of
them
would
have
been
eden
to
him
but
that
had
not
been
melville
meaning
at
that
moment
his
servants
brought
in
the
tea
noiselessly
and
quickly
little
saxe
cups
frosted
cakes
forced
strawberries
appearing
on
great
old
plateaux
of
gold
as
though
he
had
been
served
there
every
day
instead
of
having
been
absent
ten
years
othmar
you
have
a
little
of
the
haroun
alraschid
though
you
do
not
care
for
your
throne
said
melville
would
have
imagined
that
returning
from
asia
last
night
you
would
have
tea
all
ready
made
for
your
friends
friends
reconcile
me
to
my
house
said
othmar
will
leave
almost
a
perfume
of
home
behind
you
these
rooms
will
seem
lonely
no
more
rooms
are
quite
perfect
said
princess
nadine
still
i
think
we
will
have
our
tea
out
of
doors
the
sun
is
still
brilliant
we
have
now
and
then
little
fits
of
rurality
when
we
have
those
we
sit
on
a
terrace
and
take
tea
that
is
as
near
rusticity
as
we
care
to
go
she
walked
through
one
of
the
doorways
into
the
air
as
she
spoke
to
othmar
the
room
with
its
white
roses
and
blue
irises
seemed
to
grow
dark
as
she
left
it
as
she
passed
out
to
the
gardens
his
people
brought
him
a
note
it
was
inside
a
envelope
with
a
silver
upon
it
and
on
a
card
was
written
a
very
pressingly
worded
invitation
to
dinner
the
following
night
with
his
neighbours
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
vannes
they
had
just
heard
of
his
arrival
they
would
have
a
few
people
they
begged
him
not
to
be
formal
the
château
nearest
to
him
was
millo
their
favourite
winter
retreat
a
gorgeous
and
fantastic
place
with
many
a
gilded
cupola
and
shining
dome
which
caught
the
sunshine
from
the
sea
amidst
groves
of
magnolia
and
woods
of
ilex
he
had
not
been
to
millo
for
ten
years
when
he
had
been
last
there
the
duc
had
been
just
married
to
a
famous
beauty
and
he
had
known
them
very
well
in
paris
ever
since
that
time
they
were
not
people
for
whom
he
cared
much
alain
de
vannes
was
a
sporting
man
and
his
wife
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
fashion
with
half
a
hundred
lovers
given
to
her
rightly
or
wrongly
by
report
they
were
however
legitimist
in
politics
to
the
backbone
neither
of
their
families
had
ever
pandered
to
emperor
or
elysée
and
they
were
despite
their
easy
morals
and
their
profound
indifference
to
each
other
exceedingly
exclusive
and
with
all
their
nonchalance
even
arrogant
must
be
a
strange
house
for
that
poor
little
girl
he
thought
as
he
threw
the
card
aside
and
remembered
the
greuze
face
in
the
venetian
red
boat
millo
was
not
more
than
a
mile
off
him
at
one
point
their
woods
and
his
joined
and
looking
from
his
terrace
any
day
he
could
see
the
gilded
minarets
and
the
varicoloured
tiles
of
their
villas
shining
in
the
light
against
billows
of
dark
evergreen
foliage
soon
they
know
you
are
here
said
nadine
napraxine
as
he
spoke
of
the
invitation
to
her
will
go
of
course
you
can
not
have
any
engagements
you
be
there
do
not
know
yes
perhaps
i
never
make
up
my
mind
until
the
last
hour
people
say
it
is
cruel
when
they
have
dinners
it
leaves
a
place
blank
but
how
can
you
be
sure
what
you
wish
to
do
until
the
moment
comes
i
detest
dinners
when
we
have
really
become
civilised
we
shall
each
of
us
eat
in
solitude
or
at
the
least
each
behind
his
own
screen
why
should
one
of
the
unloveliest
of
the
operations
of
nature
be
performed
in
public
the
flowers
and
the
plate
and
the
footmen
can
not
really
embellish
it
indeed
they
only
make
it
the
more
grotesque
droll
you
are
nadine
said
lady
brancepeth
have
certainly
a
monopoly
of
singular
ideas
wish
my
ideas
were
general
answered
the
princess
the
world
has
really
refined
itself
it
will
look
on
our
eating
in
society
as
we
look
now
on
savages
eating
with
their
fingers
some
of
our
friends
can
not
even
have
a
little
love
affair
but
they
must
go
and
eat
prawns
and
quails
and
together
in
a
café
and
if
a
hero
comes
home
from
a
war
anywhere
his
countrymen
at
once
make
him
eat
and
drink
in
public
by
way
of
showing
their
respect
for
him
the
whole
thing
is
absurd
the
only
creature
that
is
not
offensive
when
it
eats
is
a
bird
just
one
little
dive
in
a
rose
or
under
a
and
it
has
breakfasted
but
we
a
very
pretty
woman
eats
a
strawberry
the
bird
is
not
very
much
her
superior
murmured
melville
father
said
the
princess
have
no
business
to
know
whether
one
is
pretty
or
not
fruit
perhaps
does
keep
something
of
the
golden
age
about
it
but
our
dinners
were
i
a
man
i
would
never
see
the
woman
i
admired
taking
her
share
of
diseased
livers
tortured
fish
slaughtered
songsters
they
are
fond
of
writing
nowadays
about
a
higher
humanity
which
will
succeed
to
ours
but
my
idea
of
it
would
be
that
it
should
be
fed
like
fénelon
islanders
by
only
breathing
sweet
odours
that
would
be
even
better
than
the
bird
dip
in
the
rose
you
will
not
go
to
millo
persisted
othmar
knows
what
one
may
do
in
hours
the
servants
had
carried
the
gold
trays
out
into
the
garden
after
her
melville
and
lady
brancepeth
who
were
more
comfortable
in
the
embrace
of
their
plush
couches
returned
othmar
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
hers
and
offered
her
a
cigarette
always
wants
this
consolation
princess
he
said
as
he
did
so
not
till
i
have
finished
my
strawberries
they
are
delicious
how
do
you
manage
your
households
if
we
go
home
unexpectedly
anywhere
we
always
find
the
servants
away
the
drunk
the
house
and
not
a
thing
to
eat
within
twenty
miles
how
did
you
keep
them
at
this
point
of
perfection
are
never
sure
that
i
may
not
arrive
at
any
moment
if
servants
be
not
ready
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
they
are
not
worth
their
salt
then
i
have
very
faithful
stewards
marvel
does
not
explain
another
the
fidelity
is
perhaps
more
astonishing
than
the
perpetual
readiness
reward
fidelity
most
people
limit
themselves
to
accepting
it
if
you
do
not
pay
your
servant
well
he
will
help
himself
am
sure
we
pay
pay
endlessly
platon
spends
heaven
knows
what
on
the
servants
but
he
gets
only
a
mob
of
rogues
who
rob
him
right
and
left
have
no
right
to
suppose
the
prince
less
wise
than
myself
but
perhaps
there
is
other
payment
as
well
as
money
in
which
he
does
not
deal
i
let
the
humblest
man
in
my
service
have
plenty
of
hope
there
is
no
moral
tonic
so
bracing
each
of
them
knows
that
he
may
rise
if
he
only
deserve
it
then
again
i
am
heedful
to
have
my
men
of
high
character
a
is
viceroy
one
can
not
be
too
careful
in
choosing
him
should
never
have
supposed
you
cared
about
those
things
othmar
she
said
in
much
surprise
as
she
stared
at
him
a
strawberry
held
uneaten
against
her
lips
must
think
about
them
or
be
at
war
with
one
conscience
he
answered
is
the
tedium
of
life
its
duties
are
so
inexorable
and
so
wearisome
an
easy
conscience
absolutely
necessary
to
you
i
could
easily
imagine
circumstances
under
which
a
guilty
one
would
make
me
carry
it
lightly
a
gleam
of
the
old
passionate
emotion
which
she
had
once
known
in
him
passed
for
a
moment
into
his
eyes
with
gloom
and
fire
mingled
he
repressed
it
he
did
not
wish
her
to
believe
that
she
had
still
the
power
over
his
life
which
she
actually
possessed
he
heard
her
voice
saying
always
will
have
no
melodramatic
passions
to
disturb
me
they
are
absurd
they
are
out
of
date
they
are
tiresome
and
she
had
said
it
out
of
no
virtue
only
out
of
sheer
shallowness
and
indifference
is
a
very
shocking
sentiment
she
said
demurely
now
as
she
ate
another
strawberry
least
one
is
bound
to
say
so
monsignore
in
there
would
certainly
say
so
indeed
from
monsignore
point
of
view
one
would
certainly
think
it
so
but
as
all
we
modern
people
whatever
church
we
ostensibly
belong
to
are
all
so
completely
of
one
mind
that
we
know
we
are
only
automata
made
up
of
and
different
gases
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
necessarily
have
consciences
at
all
do
you
why
should
we
have
one
any
more
than
the
zostera
from
which
i
named
that
yacht
because
the
zosteræ
have
no
traditions
of
a
conscience
all
men
have
men
savages
have
not
primitive
races
have
not
and
how
should
we
know
whether
the
zostera
has
or
has
not
she
may
have
a
very
perfect
system
of
ethics
sitting
on
her
rocks
in
reach
of
the
tide
i
should
think
indeed
she
had
a
sort
of
buddhism
named
that
yacht
he
said
abruptly
geraldine
had
her
built
last
year
he
is
not
like
you
he
has
not
a
superstition
that
one
is
bound
to
go
on
sailing
in
the
same
ship
all
one
life
however
she
may
grow
geraldine
has
many
superiorities
over
me
he
has
the
patience
to
play
at
platonic
cicisbeism
as
children
play
for
counters
said
othmar
with
a
brusque
contempt
is
neither
a
speech
nor
a
true
one
said
nadine
napraxine
very
calmly
as
she
set
down
her
cup
breeding
i
can
not
defend
its
truth
i
do
he
answered
coldly
are
men
who
can
spend
their
lives
carrying
a
woman
fan
and
ask
for
nothing
more
at
her
hands
they
have
merits
no
doubt
but
they
are
not
those
which
i
appreciate
ralph
if
he
heard
you
she
said
with
a
little
yawn
which
she
could
not
control
though
she
tried
to
stifle
it
with
a
cigarette
thinks
himself
far
more
manly
than
you
because
he
shoots
fur
and
feather
and
you
do
not
kill
anything
except
a
man
now
and
then
may
yet
add
to
the
list
of
the
latter
said
othmar
mongolians
have
made
you
very
savage
she
said
as
she
lighted
the
cigarette
you
used
to
be
so
gentle
used
to
be
many
things
that
i
have
ceased
to
be
since
the
twentieth
of
april
a
year
and
eight
months
ago
said
othmar
she
had
forgotten
the
date
which
he
remembered
so
accurately
the
date
of
the
day
on
which
they
had
parted
in
her
own
room
in
paris
with
the
smell
of
the
lilac
of
the
avenue
coming
in
through
the
open
windows
and
the
sunset
rays
as
they
came
through
the
blinds
touching
her
fair
face
and
the
curl
of
her
long
dark
lashes
and
the
beautiful
mouth
with
the
little
cruel
languid
smile
on
it
as
she
had
said
will
have
no
melodramatic
passions
to
disturb
me
she
looked
at
him
now
with
the
demure
of
a
child
i
never
could
remember
dates
she
murmured
was
the
despair
of
all
my
governesses
i
had
such
a
bad
memory
is
convenient
sometimes
said
othmar
a
little
bitterly
why
were
all
those
past
hours
written
on
his
remembrance
as
the
chisel
writes
on
stone
whilst
she
had
shaken
off
their
memories
as
a
bird
shakes
a
summer
rain
off
its
wings
how
he
added
with
an
effort
such
a
defective
brain
as
you
describe
have
you
become
one
of
the
most
cultured
women
of
europe
does
forgetfulness
of
dates
enhance
the
power
of
acquiring
other
knowledge
think
it
leaves
the
brain
freer
she
answered
in
that
serene
way
which
she
had
with
her
when
she
was
intending
that
a
man
should
never
forget
her
whatever
she
might
choose
to
forget
doubt
he
said
impatiently
doubt
learned
women
have
never
been
very
tender
ones
what
a
terrific
word
would
you
call
a
mere
poor
frivolous
like
me
by
the
same
word
that
described
lady
jane
grey
and
somerville
i
know
a
few
languages
i
had
of
every
nation
when
i
was
a
baby
and
i
have
read
schopenhauer
and
herbert
spencer
and
i
assure
you
that
one
bored
me
as
much
as
the
other
but
learned
would
a
eat
your
strawberries
or
smoke
your
cigarettes
take
all
my
heart
and
my
soul
out
of
me
he
thought
as
he
answered
certainly
your
one
great
science
madame
was
never
learned
either
in
the
nursery
or
out
of
schopenhauer
and
herbert
spencer
it
is
the
perfection
of
high
art
and
you
like
all
supreme
artists
can
not
pause
to
remember
what
your
studies
may
cost
to
your
subjects
she
did
not
ask
him
what
art
or
science
he
meant
she
lighted
a
second
cigarette
and
said
in
her
sweetest
voice
do
not
think
you
are
quite
so
as
you
used
to
be
count
othmar
look
the
sun
is
low
it
is
time
to
be
going
homeward
what
are
monsignore
and
evelyn
doing
will
you
call
them
please
yet
a
little
while
i
have
not
seen
you
for
so
long
he
murmured
ashamed
and
irritated
at
his
own
weakness
in
letting
the
words
escape
him
you
have
not
she
said
with
a
gay
laugh
you
have
been
in
asia
and
i
in
europe
why
did
you
go
to
asia
people
do
not
do
that
sort
of
thing
nowadays
if
they
be
annoyed
they
walk
down
to
their
club
and
play
hard
or
they
ride
a
horse
at
a
steeplechase
and
in
a
week
they
think
no
more
about
it
and
why
did
you
have
that
duel
with
de
sénélac
it
was
very
imprudent
i
had
told
you
i
could
not
bear
that
kind
of
melodrama
nobody
knew
certainly
but
that
was
only
because
they
were
all
stupid
any
one
might
have
known
and
sénélac
never
left
his
bed
for
six
months
and
have
you
heard
that
he
will
limp
they
say
for
ever
othmar
with
a
gesture
intimated
that
the
misfortune
of
his
late
adversary
was
a
matter
of
utter
indifference
you
be
sorry
that
he
limps
he
said
impatiently
sorry
that
you
gave
him
your
bouquet
to
carry
princess
you
are
very
fond
of
psychological
studies
but
you
do
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
what
others
pay
for
them
you
know
well
enough
what
men
suffer
for
you
and
through
you
but
you
do
not
choose
ever
to
blame
yourself
for
making
them
do
so
the
world
has
not
changed
the
mode
of
expression
may
have
altered
but
men
feel
as
they
felt
in
the
days
of
david
or
of
æschylus
love
is
what
it
was
then
a
mere
passing
pleasure
or
pain
to
many
but
to
some
the
herald
of
heaven
or
of
hell
the
begetter
of
heroism
or
of
crime
dear
othmar
pray
excuse
me
said
nadine
napraxine
talk
beautifully
you
always
did
but
i
can
not
stay
to
hear
you
when
the
sun
is
just
going
down
and
we
have
only
a
yacht
that
crawls
to
take
us
home
to
dinner
it
is
my
fault
that
it
crawls
he
would
have
had
a
steam
one
if
i
had
not
prevented
him
i
detest
smoke
and
machinery
but
still
certainly
without
them
one
crawls
monsignore
will
you
come
if
you
have
finished
talking
about
the
little
sisters
of
the
poor
othmar
face
grew
cold
a
sombre
displeasure
darkened
his
eyes
he
drew
back
and
let
melville
join
madame
napraxine
he
himself
walked
beside
her
friend
down
the
path
through
the
woods
talking
but
not
sensible
of
what
he
said
watching
the
red
sunshade
with
its
embroidered
pass
before
him
under
the
boughs
as
they
neared
the
quay
he
took
from
the
hands
of
one
of
his
men
two
bouquets
of
gardenias
and
orchids
and
offered
them
to
the
two
ladies
they
were
in
pretty
cornucopiæ
of
silvered
any
one
would
have
thought
that
there
had
been
the
preparation
of
a
week
for
this
afternoon
visit
are
said
madame
napraxine
as
she
took
her
orchids
will
you
pretend
to
be
a
barbarian
the
little
graceful
amenities
of
the
world
become
you
and
you
do
them
so
well
though
you
do
them
so
seldom
why
will
you
make
yourself
homme
de
foyer
it
is
much
nicer
she
added
in
a
low
murmur
give
me
a
bouquet
than
to
shoot
another
man
for
carrying
one
he
did
not
answer
her
jests
jarred
on
him
when
they
reached
the
quay
the
sun
was
setting
the
boat
was
waiting
the
sailors
immovable
their
oars
held
straight
in
the
air
othmar
said
the
princess
nadine
gaily
château
is
marvellous
your
orchids
are
exquisite
and
your
tea
was
enchanting
we
will
leave
you
all
alone
in
your
poetic
solitude
and
when
you
want
prose
and
society
you
will
come
to
la
jacquemerille
you
not
honour
me
again
he
said
angry
at
his
own
weakness
you
not
dine
with
me
night
or
the
day
after
i
think
the
prince
would
come
platon
would
come
certainly
said
nadine
napraxine
with
a
smile
are
his
especial
friend
he
shall
come
to
you
alone
then
you
can
talk
to
him
as
much
as
you
like
about
the
burning
of
moscow
and
and
all
those
other
dates
for
which
you
have
so
admirable
a
memory
she
would
say
no
more
than
that
and
her
musical
slight
laugh
tantalised
his
ear
as
the
boat
was
pushed
off
in
the
deep
blue
water
and
the
seamen
bent
above
their
oars
otho
othmar
leaned
against
the
marble
balustrade
and
watched
them
row
away
towards
the
schooner
with
an
anger
in
which
vain
regrets
and
baffled
desires
were
mingled
disconsolately
he
remained
there
till
the
sun
was
gone
down
and
the
white
canvas
of
the
yacht
had
passed
out
of
sight
round
a
bend
of
the
shore
when
he
retraced
his
steps
to
his
solitary
house
he
saw
a
lying
beside
the
gilded
garden
chair
which
she
had
occupied
as
she
ate
her
strawberries
it
was
the
one
which
she
had
gathered
and
dropped
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
coat
on
aime
on
que
vingt
he
thought
with
scorn
for
himself
he
entered
the
golden
wrote
a
formal
note
of
invitation
to
the
prince
and
princess
napraxine
and
said
to
one
of
his
servants
a
messenger
over
with
this
letter
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
the
villa
that
is
called
la
jacquemerille
yet
he
had
come
from
asia
with
the
firm
resolve
to
show
the
princess
napraxine
that
he
had
conquered
all
passion
for
her
and
he
was
not
on
the
whole
a
weak
man
chapter
vi
he
dined
alone
a
few
telegrams
would
have
filled
his
rooms
but
he
did
not
care
for
society
which
he
thought
only
came
to
him
because
he
was
one
of
the
few
owners
of
milliards
in
europe
he
sat
alone
after
dinner
in
the
salon
which
she
had
admired
with
the
light
of
half
a
hundred
wax
candles
bringing
out
the
golden
gleams
in
the
plush
the
colours
of
the
embroidered
irises
the
dead
gold
of
the
cornice
and
panels
while
a
fire
of
olive
wood
glowed
under
the
carvings
of
the
mantelpiece
of
porphyry
the
plush
curtains
with
the
lace
beneath
them
veiled
the
shuttered
windows
outside
the
night
was
calm
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
the
words
of
melville
came
back
to
him
as
he
sat
there
in
the
midst
of
the
luxury
and
of
the
loneliness
make
a
home
is
in
the
power
of
any
man
who
is
not
a
priest
it
did
not
seem
to
him
to
lie
in
his
he
could
have
bought
a
principality
but
he
could
not
buy
a
home
love
alone
could
create
that
and
the
only
woman
he
had
loved
for
years
was
nadine
napraxine
if
she
had
been
what
he
wished
to
him
would
she
have
made
him
this
ideal
home
she
capricious
indifferent
disdainful
as
she
had
said
in
every
habit
thought
and
attitude
of
her
life
perhaps
not
probably
not
he
knew
yet
she
alone
would
have
had
power
to
make
a
melody
out
of
the
discords
of
his
desires
and
his
discontent
she
alone
seemed
to
him
to
fill
the
vacant
places
to
smile
across
the
solitary
room
to
have
left
the
lingering
perfume
of
her
presence
there
as
the
orange
flowers
left
their
fragrance
in
the
cabinet
in
which
they
were
laid
for
a
moment
otho
othmar
was
one
of
the
richest
men
in
europe
he
was
often
disposed
to
regret
it
as
many
persons
regret
that
to
which
they
have
been
born
he
did
not
think
it
a
thing
to
be
vain
of
he
was
even
occasionally
ashamed
of
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
when
you
were
so
much
richer
than
most
of
your
fellows
you
were
required
to
be
very
much
better
than
they
and
it
is
not
always
agreeable
nor
often
easy
to
be
so
when
he
signed
it
was
as
when
an
emperor
signs
his
name
and
with
a
stroke
of
the
pen
he
could
give
away
millions
with
as
much
ease
as
lesser
mortals
can
scatter
pence
this
facility
was
no
pleasure
to
him
though
he
was
well
aware
that
riches
are
the
one
ruling
power
of
the
modern
world
and
comprise
in
themselves
the
wishing
cap
and
the
magician
wand
excalibur
and
holy
grail
he
did
not
greatly
prize
his
possession
of
them
perhaps
because
they
had
been
always
before
him
and
about
him
in
profusion
from
his
birth
the
othmar
fortune
had
been
steadily
growing
for
a
century
and
a
half
at
the
commencement
marc
othmar
a
croat
native
of
agram
had
been
a
poor
man
enough
a
horse
dealer
some
said
a
horse
stealer
what
precisely
never
was
known
agram
is
not
a
very
greatly
frequented
place
and
records
get
easily
mildewed
and
dim
in
it
whether
he
began
life
as
pedlar
or
peasant
or
as
some
affirmed
as
a
robber
of
wild
colts
marc
othmar
at
forty
years
old
was
a
commission
agent
and
banker
and
at
sixty
had
become
a
millionaire
known
of
far
beyond
croatia
and
had
laid
the
foundations
of
one
of
the
great
financial
houses
of
eastern
europe
his
son
quadrupled
his
possessions
and
extended
his
operations
westward
and
northward
his
grandson
fell
upon
the
hard
times
of
the
napoleonic
wars
as
on
a
bed
of
roses
and
from
the
misfortunes
of
austria
and
prussia
and
the
necessities
of
pitt
england
made
gold
as
rapidly
as
though
he
had
had
the
philosopher
stone
in
a
crucible
he
grew
into
a
very
colossus
of
riches
and
his
houses
did
their
business
in
vienna
paris
london
and
frankfort
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
french
duke
and
made
his
central
house
of
business
in
paris
his
eldest
son
stefan
who
inherited
all
his
astuteness
succeeded
him
in
due
course
in
the
direction
of
affairs
ably
seconded
by
his
brother
friederich
and
in
his
turn
married
the
daughter
of
an
english
nobleman
by
whom
he
had
one
son
otho
who
was
chiefly
educated
in
england
and
who
had
little
or
nothing
of
the
othmar
type
in
feature
or
in
character
he
was
a
boy
of
infinite
promise
and
of
no
ordinary
mind
but
despite
his
personal
and
intellectual
gifts
he
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
his
father
and
the
indifference
which
at
times
deepened
into
contempt
with
which
the
lad
reviewed
the
origin
and
the
employment
of
the
fortunes
of
his
house
seemed
to
him
nothing
short
of
blasphemy
stefan
othmar
himself
was
a
man
of
excessive
arrogance
but
it
was
a
bourgeois
arrogance
proud
of
its
own
sources
and
dominion
and
capable
of
infinite
in
the
pursuit
of
that
his
boy
should
revolt
against
his
descent
and
despise
the
future
before
him
was
a
fact
so
hideous
and
so
amazing
in
his
sight
that
had
he
not
known
his
dead
wife
to
have
been
the
purest
and
coldest
of
women
he
would
almost
have
doubted
that
his
own
blood
ran
in
the
veins
of
his
degenerate
heir
as
otho
grew
towards
manhood
the
distance
between
them
widened
more
and
more
that
a
fastidious
fine
gentleman
a
fantastic
and
futile
dreamer
a
mere
visionary
and
dilettante
should
be
the
outcome
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
financial
success
and
ambition
seemed
to
count
stefan
so
frightful
a
mockery
of
fortune
that
he
cursed
his
own
folly
in
having
wedded
a
patrician
instead
of
some
woman
of
a
common
but
ambitious
stock
who
would
have
given
him
successors
content
and
solely
content
with
the
superb
position
of
princes
of
finance
and
capable
of
doubling
and
quadrupling
those
many
millions
which
were
his
own
ecstasy
the
very
virtues
of
his
son
alarmed
him
as
hardly
any
vices
would
have
done
the
youth
was
so
delicate
of
mind
and
taste
so
devout
and
chaste
of
habit
so
meditative
and
so
solitary
by
choice
that
his
father
grew
alarmed
lest
he
should
actually
do
what
he
at
times
threatened
and
consecrate
himself
to
the
catholic
priesthood
he
took
a
violent
remedy
he
went
to
one
of
the
most
seductive
and
most
venal
women
of
the
day
and
said
to
her
this
boy
from
his
dreams
or
he
will
become
a
monk
she
undertook
the
mission
and
succeeded
in
it
she
destroyed
all
that
was
spiritual
and
innocent
in
him
with
the
merciless
witchery
of
the
courtesan
which
is
like
the
tide
of
burning
lava
no
grass
will
spring
where
the
scoria
has
spread
he
awoke
in
her
arms
without
a
faith
he
never
again
dreamed
of
the
religious
life
she
earned
well
the
estate
in
and
the
large
sum
in
rouleaux
which
his
father
settled
on
her
but
nothing
in
could
ever
give
him
back
those
heavenward
aspirations
that
purity
of
soul
which
she
had
swept
away
as
with
a
wave
of
fire
like
the
young
reichstadt
before
him
he
had
wasted
all
the
splendour
and
innocence
of
a
first
passion
on
a
wanton
who
had
betrayed
him
for
gold
the
first
passion
of
a
boy
colours
all
his
future
the
flavour
of
this
remained
with
him
through
all
his
later
years
love
without
it
was
tasteless
love
with
it
was
worthless
he
said
once
to
his
father
had
better
have
killed
me
than
have
given
me
to
sara
vernon
passes
by
the
gates
of
disillusion
has
died
twice
his
father
had
pushed
him
with
a
hard
hand
through
those
gates
believing
that
they
led
to
the
path
of
and
of
empire
over
men
stefan
othmar
had
not
wanted
a
poet
a
scholar
a
philanthropist
or
a
priest
for
his
successor
he
had
wanted
a
unscrupulous
unyielding
financier
to
hold
and
even
to
increase
the
mighty
powers
and
possessions
of
which
the
name
of
othmar
was
a
symbol
to
the
world
but
the
crime
he
had
committed
did
not
obtain
for
him
what
he
desired
the
merciless
cynicism
with
which
he
had
destroyed
the
faith
and
the
purity
of
his
son
did
not
ensure
its
object
the
youth
remained
as
aloof
in
mind
from
the
traditions
of
his
house
and
as
disdainful
in
spirit
of
them
as
he
had
been
before
he
consented
indeed
with
apathy
to
put
his
signature
to
the
deeds
which
made
him
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
house
but
that
was
all
which
stefan
othmar
gained
by
his
son
immeasurable
loss
some
four
years
later
when
otho
was
years
of
age
stefan
othmar
died
suddenly
on
the
steps
of
his
great
hotel
in
the
boulevard
germain
as
he
was
ascending
them
after
an
audience
at
the
tuileries
in
which
he
had
been
the
master
of
the
situation
and
napoléon
trois
the
suppliant
he
died
of
fulminant
apoplexy
without
an
instant
warning
but
his
affairs
were
left
in
the
most
perfect
order
his
brother
fritz
remained
who
had
been
his
all
his
life
and
nothing
was
altered
in
the
house
of
othmar
of
which
his
son
became
supreme
master
the
young
man
received
the
news
far
away
in
the
forest
recesses
of
lahore
at
the
court
of
an
indian
prince
where
he
was
being
feasted
with
royal
honours
in
the
course
of
his
travels
over
the
world
there
had
been
no
sympathy
between
his
father
and
himself
their
temperaments
had
been
as
opposite
as
the
poles
little
sentiment
of
personal
affection
mingled
with
his
sudden
consciousness
that
he
was
absolute
lord
of
his
own
destinies
his
first
impulse
was
to
use
the
power
into
which
he
had
entered
to
destroy
at
a
blow
all
that
his
forefathers
had
been
a
century
and
a
half
in
building
up
for
him
is
a
mass
of
corruption
it
shall
perish
he
said
to
himself
with
the
ruthless
integrity
the
unsparing
fanaticism
of
a
generous
and
youth
but
when
he
returned
to
england
and
came
face
to
face
with
all
his
responsibilities
and
powers
he
found
that
which
he
had
thought
so
easy
was
quite
impossible
to
accomplish
as
he
desired
to
accomplish
it
his
first
impulse
was
to
throw
the
whole
into
liquidation
and
efface
the
house
of
othmar
from
financial
existence
for
ever
but
to
do
so
was
but
a
dream
the
financial
world
would
not
have
released
him
from
his
obligations
his
only
living
relative
his
father
brother
and
partner
baron
friederich
othmar
stoutly
refused
to
suffer
that
to
be
done
which
would
in
his
sight
have
been
a
greater
crime
than
many
murders
against
his
desires
and
against
his
conscience
he
had
on
reaching
his
majority
been
half
persuaded
half
coerced
by
his
father
to
associate
himself
in
legal
form
with
the
house
the
act
had
been
one
of
filial
sacrifice
and
it
hung
like
a
wallet
of
stones
about
his
neck
he
found
that
his
power
had
its
limits
that
he
could
no
more
disengage
himself
from
all
the
operations
and
engagements
of
his
firm
than
a
young
king
can
emancipate
himself
from
the
trammels
of
court
and
constitution
he
had
a
right
to
ruin
himself
but
he
had
no
right
to
ruin
all
those
whose
fortunes
were
interwoven
with
the
enterprises
of
his
predecessors
irritated
and
disappointed
he
resigned
himself
to
the
inevitable
and
remained
the
of
milliards
with
as
much
regret
as
the
young
francis
joseph
accepted
the
diadem
of
austria
the
cloth
of
gold
in
which
they
his
forefathers
had
wrapped
him
remained
upon
him
and
sometimes
he
thought
it
a
very
shirt
of
nessus
sometimes
he
was
almost
tempted
to
take
the
vow
of
poverty
for
the
sake
of
getting
rid
of
it
but
he
was
restrained
by
two
recollections
one
that
he
had
no
spiritual
faith
the
other
that
mankind
in
general
would
have
voted
him
insane
a
profound
melancholy
without
any
definite
or
special
cause
grew
upon
him
he
felt
the
sense
of
an
immense
responsibility
which
he
saw
no
manner
of
using
with
proportionate
usefulness
the
sophism
that
duties
unsought
may
be
disregarded
did
not
satisfy
his
conscience
whilst
his
knowledge
of
the
world
told
him
that
to
do
harm
is
as
easy
as
to
kiss
your
hand
whilst
to
effect
any
great
good
is
as
hard
as
to
move
the
mountains
from
their
bases
public
charity
only
fills
the
pockets
of
greedy
speculators
private
charity
too
often
raises
up
a
festering
mass
of
imposture
the
rich
man
goes
through
the
world
as
a
sheep
through
briars
in
spring
time
if
he
be
a
perfect
egotist
he
is
happy
enough
if
he
have
thought
and
feeling
he
is
depressed
by
the
universal
greed
around
him
and
by
the
absolute
impotence
of
all
religions
to
bridle
it
otho
othmar
remained
always
sensible
of
a
bitter
irritation
and
degradation
whenever
he
recalled
the
sources
of
the
wealth
he
enjoyed
the
ruin
of
prosperous
countries
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
wars
the
distress
or
disgrace
of
ancient
nobilities
the
impoverishment
of
nations
true
there
was
another
side
to
the
throne
of
plutus
on
which
his
fathers
had
seated
themselves
by
their
means
no
doubt
enterprises
had
been
carried
out
for
which
humanity
on
the
whole
was
materially
if
not
spiritually
the
better
canals
deserts
mines
cities
colonies
ocean
ways
had
felt
the
vivifying
powers
of
the
great
othmar
loans
but
the
evil
appeared
to
him
far
to
the
good
and
all
the
wealth
seemed
to
him
tainted
he
had
considerable
pride
in
a
shape
with
which
men
would
not
have
sympathised
he
fancied
that
the
inherited
nobility
of
his
french
and
english
blood
was
always
at
war
with
the
blood
of
the
croat
bankers
by
whom
he
had
been
begotten
though
his
position
was
one
which
almost
all
the
world
envied
it
was
one
which
galled
himself
titles
had
been
offered
him
but
he
had
contemptuously
rejected
them
he
was
othmar
the
name
spoke
to
all
the
ears
of
europe
he
did
not
consider
that
the
story
it
told
could
be
either
changed
or
buried
by
smothering
it
underneath
the
blaze
of
some
princeship
or
dukedom
he
did
not
even
call
himself
as
others
called
him
count
othmar
and
he
put
neither
coronet
or
escutcheon
on
his
carriages
his
plate
or
his
he
was
far
too
proud
to
be
proud
in
that
way
illustrious
alliances
had
been
proposed
to
him
but
he
had
rejected
all
the
world
expected
him
to
marry
greatly
but
he
remained
the
hope
and
the
despair
of
all
the
european
nobilities
who
would
have
willingly
accorded
him
any
one
of
their
fair
virgins
their
eagerness
had
early
given
him
a
cynical
disdain
for
the
aristocracies
to
which
his
tastes
attracted
him
he
had
no
less
a
disdain
for
the
financial
order
to
which
tradition
allied
him
on
the
whole
although
he
had
never
had
any
especial
sorrow
he
was
scarcely
a
happy
man
though
the
whole
world
was
ready
to
gratify
and
amuse
him
he
had
been
always
able
to
indulge
his
fancies
to
the
uttermost
but
all
the
venal
beauty
which
affected
adoration
for
him
left
his
heart
cold
though
gentle
in
manner
and
chary
of
speech
he
could
on
provocation
say
caustic
truths
which
cut
like
surgeons
knives
in
general
however
he
was
indulgent
to
follies
which
he
did
not
share
he
lived
always
a
little
apart
from
the
world
in
which
he
was
so
conspicuous
a
figure
and
he
judged
it
with
good
nature
rather
than
with
sympathy
occasionally
as
nadine
napraxine
had
said
voyait
en
the
bitterness
of
spirit
which
comes
over
all
who
see
themselves
sought
for
what
they
possess
passed
over
him
also
but
its
pessimism
never
lasted
long
that
human
nature
was
trivial
but
not
evil
was
on
the
whole
the
result
of
his
experiences
by
one
of
the
odd
caprices
in
which
destiny
delights
a
lettered
ease
would
have
been
the
utmost
he
would
have
cared
to
command
the
incessant
demands
which
a
great
fortune
always
brings
upon
its
possessor
were
to
him
irksome
wherever
he
went
mankind
pursued
him
hat
in
hand
and
hand
outstretched
he
could
arrive
nowhere
without
petitions
and
invitations
raining
in
on
him
obscurity
was
not
to
be
enjoyed
even
in
mongolia
where
the
foreign
ministers
at
the
chinese
court
and
the
celestial
emperor
himself
sent
mounted
messengers
after
him
to
see
that
he
came
to
no
harm
the
interest
everywhere
excited
by
his
arrival
or
by
his
actions
irritated
him
perpetually
the
impossibility
of
securing
privacy
to
him
formed
the
gravest
of
annoyances
his
intolerance
of
publicity
made
him
almost
detest
the
whole
human
race
which
combined
to
refuse
it
to
him
to
be
compelled
to
live
in
a
appeared
to
him
to
destroy
the
very
first
requisite
for
life
enjoyment
he
concealed
this
sensitiveness
under
a
chilliness
of
manner
which
did
injustice
to
the
real
warmth
of
his
sympathies
there
was
much
that
was
at
once
attractive
and
irritating
to
women
in
this
young
man
whose
fortunes
were
so
immense
and
power
so
extended
who
yet
passed
through
the
world
with
so
unaffected
an
indifference
to
his
own
advantages
in
it
and
who
had
the
melancholy
and
romantic
features
of
a
ruy
blas
or
of
a
rolla
with
men
his
perfect
simplicity
of
expression
his
unpretentious
courage
and
his
unfailing
generosity
commanded
respect
whilst
his
position
excited
their
envy
but
while
he
compelled
their
esteem
he
did
not
as
a
rule
possess
their
attachment
we
are
in
a
position
to
serve
men
greatly
we
shall
never
be
greatly
loved
by
them
said
melville
to
him
once
shall
make
too
many
ingrates
even
though
we
do
our
best
not
to
make
one
men
as
a
rule
love
most
what
they
can
afford
a
little
to
despise
and
have
no
cause
whatever
to
envy
do
you
remember
when
the
anarchists
of
came
to
old
rothschild
at
ferrières
and
demanded
his
fortune
for
the
people
of
france
and
he
very
quietly
took
up
his
pen
and
made
aloud
his
calculation
that
his
fortune
divided
thus
would
give
everyone
just
four
francs
and
a
half
each
well
the
fault
of
the
very
rich
man
to
the
world
is
always
rothschild
to
the
anarchists
everyone
expects
he
can
bestow
on
each
of
them
ten
millions
whilst
he
can
only
really
give
four
francs
and
a
half
the
calculation
may
be
as
clear
as
day
but
the
fact
is
one
never
forgiven
othmar
understood
that
very
well
with
his
reason
but
he
was
not
reconciled
to
it
in
his
heart
he
would
have
desired
something
different
the
immense
hotel
which
his
father
had
built
with
its
ceilings
painted
by
ingres
and
delaroche
its
gardens
sloping
to
the
seine
its
genuine
treasures
of
art
its
double
staircase
its
its
stables
built
on
the
model
of
chantilly
was
no
better
than
a
barn
to
him
he
detested
it
with
a
sort
of
petulance
he
never
willingly
resided
in
it
its
network
of
communication
with
the
banks
and
the
bureaux
laid
with
all
the
facilities
which
modern
science
could
invent
had
no
interest
for
him
he
did
not
feel
the
slightest
emotion
about
any
public
event
that
could
possibly
happen
whether
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
or
the
betting
of
a
racecourse
he
had
none
of
those
tastes
which
may
make
a
rich
man
popular
for
a
season
and
ruined
in
a
twelvemonth
to
his
mistresses
he
was
invariably
generous
but
these
extravagances
scarcely
made
more
impression
on
his
vast
fortune
than
a
few
pailsfull
taken
from
the
sea
make
diminution
in
its
volume
his
greatest
pleasure
on
which
he
spent
his
money
most
largely
was
music
wherever
he
was
he
gathered
great
singers
and
musicians
around
him
she
had
likened
him
to
ludwig
of
bavaria
his
caprices
were
not
quite
so
eccentric
but
his
preference
was
almost
as
ungrudgingly
indulged
he
had
studied
music
theoretically
and
profoundly
though
he
had
never
touched
any
instrument
and
had
never
written
a
bar
it
was
one
of
those
tastes
which
to
his
father
had
appeared
an
absolute
insanity
he
also
spent
much
upon
his
libraries
and
his
horses
as
the
princess
napraxine
had
said
to
him
but
since
he
was
not
a
bibliophile
and
did
not
care
for
rare
editions
and
never
raced
or
made
wagers
his
expenditure
even
here
was
moderate
as
compared
with
his
powers
from
the
time
of
his
early
and
bitter
passion
for
sara
vernon
he
had
avoided
those
famous
sorceresses
who
can
beggar
croesus
and
discrown
cæsar
they
recalled
too
vividly
to
him
the
intense
suffering
of
his
boyhood
when
he
had
found
himself
betrayed
by
what
he
adored
to
the
few
women
whom
he
had
ever
noticed
he
had
been
invariably
generous
even
to
excess
with
a
generosity
that
strove
to
make
amends
for
the
scorn
he
had
for
them
but
he
had
had
none
of
those
which
cling
like
the
octopus
and
drain
like
the
vampire
the
knowledge
that
so
many
women
would
have
drunk
the
dregs
of
infamy
at
his
word
for
the
sake
of
his
gold
held
him
aloof
from
them
he
was
conscious
that
they
pursued
him
as
the
pursues
the
fish
entangled
in
a
seine
there
was
no
venusburg
which
would
not
have
let
him
enter
into
its
enchantment
with
his
golden
key
and
this
untempted
tannhäuser
turned
away
indifferent
all
the
rest
which
attracted
other
men
gambling
feasting
drinking
racing
living
together
in
feverish
crowds
appeared
to
him
ridiculous
and
tiresome
all
the
popular
vices
of
men
of
his
rank
seemed
to
him
dull
and
vulgar
trivial
and
stupid
the
life
of
the
of
the
masher
seemed
to
him
on
the
whole
more
stupid
than
the
tartar
there
was
a
certain
similarity
between
him
and
nadine
napraxine
the
world
appeared
to
them
both
very
narrow
and
its
resources
few
for
her
the
result
of
this
impression
took
the
shape
of
disdain
in
him
of
regret
in
her
it
was
a
thirst
of
the
mind
in
him
it
was
a
hunger
of
the
heart
which
led
them
to
think
that
the
land
around
them
was
barren
his
friends
called
him
jestingly
as
chateaubriand
was
called
grand
but
it
was
precisely
his
vague
discontent
with
the
puerilities
and
the
vulgarities
of
existence
which
made
his
affinity
to
nadine
napraxine
she
had
much
the
same
contempt
for
all
those
who
surrounded
her
and
who
made
so
much
of
all
their
little
ambitions
who
crowned
themselves
with
straw
and
thought
they
reigned
who
set
their
souls
on
a
winning
horse
a
political
measure
a
policy
a
project
or
a
whilst
the
horse
was
to
her
taste
as
much
worth
wasting
thought
on
as
the
statesmanship
if
he
had
heard
of
his
own
total
ruin
he
would
have
put
a
horace
in
his
pocket
and
walked
out
of
the
great
bronze
renaissance
gates
of
his
palace
with
a
serenity
which
would
have
had
in
it
nothing
either
strained
or
affected
he
was
no
ascetic
or
philosopher
but
his
great
fortunes
bored
him
and
their
origin
annoyed
him
his
temperament
would
probably
have
led
to
higher
ambitions
if
he
had
not
been
born
to
so
much
possession
that
ambition
had
no
scope
he
was
wont
to
cite
as
the
wisest
man
the
world
had
known
the
gay
physician
of
the
fronde
epoch
gui
patin
who
sat
throughout
that
troublous
time
peaceful
and
amused
beneath
his
own
but
fate
had
seated
him
himself
beneath
the
gold
and
the
tree
seemed
to
him
a
sterile
one
it
had
neither
fragrance
nor
shade
yet
a
million
eager
hands
were
always
trying
to
pluck
from
it
and
for
him
who
sat
under
it
there
was
no
quiet
some
one
was
always
wanting
him
to
shake
down
the
fruit
into
their
hands
he
had
had
one
great
misfortune
he
had
known
satiety
almost
before
he
had
known
enjoyment
and
men
were
so
bent
upon
making
use
of
him
that
they
did
not
take
time
to
attach
him
to
them
before
they
disgusted
him
the
world
in
general
did
not
like
him
much
it
followed
him
endlessly
but
it
thought
his
reserve
arrogance
his
simplicity
of
taste
affectation
and
his
dislike
to
display
avarice
it
did
not
comprehend
in
the
least
the
simple
truth
that
othmar
would
have
shaken
his
gold
off
him
if
he
could
have
done
so
like
so
much
mud
in
the
croat
character
there
are
both
romance
and
religion
he
had
more
of
the
croat
than
the
english
temper
in
him
but
like
most
men
of
his
time
he
had
no
belief
at
all
though
it
was
a
sorrow
to
him
not
a
boast
and
the
romance
of
his
impulses
had
been
early
chilled
and
silenced
by
the
venal
passions
offered
to
his
boyhood
for
sake
of
his
wealth
he
learned
too
early
that
there
is
scarcely
anything
which
may
not
be
bought
it
is
a
knowledge
which
hardens
the
selfish
but
saddens
the
generous
nature
the
irresistible
conviction
that
money
is
after
all
the
one
great
power
of
the
world
is
not
an
exhilarating
or
a
consoling
fact
for
thoughtful
or
visionary
minds
he
knew
very
well
that
he
might
have
been
the
most
vicious
brute
the
most
brutal
tyrant
the
most
merciless
of
men
and
mankind
would
have
served
followed
and
flattered
him
none
the
less
he
could
have
purchased
immunity
for
most
crimes
condonation
for
most
iniquities
so
long
as
he
had
remained
master
of
his
fortune
and
of
his
possessions
he
knew
that
men
would
have
sought
him
none
the
less
eagerly
though
he
had
had
the
vices
of
a
heliogabalus
and
that
women
would
have
given
themselves
to
him
none
the
less
willingly
though
he
had
been
as
hideous
as
the
veiled
prophet
it
did
not
make
him
cynical
but
it
made
him
indifferent
and
it
moved
him
at
times
to
a
vague
sadness
it
seemed
scarcely
worth
while
for
his
forefathers
to
have
raised
that
mountain
of
gold
only
that
from
its
summit
he
might
see
the
nakedness
of
the
world
of
men
chapter
vii
at
eight
on
the
following
night
othmar
walked
across
his
gardens
under
a
starlit
sky
towards
the
adjacent
grounds
of
millo
a
few
roods
of
plantation
parted
his
from
theirs
in
the
boundary
fence
there
was
a
small
gate
of
which
his
had
reminded
him
that
a
key
existed
the
night
was
young
but
the
stars
already
were
many
and
a
slender
moon
had
risen
in
the
deep
serene
blue
of
the
heavens
though
it
was
midwinter
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
smell
of
orange
orchards
in
flower
and
of
the
aromatic
of
his
own
enclosures
she
be
there
he
thought
a
hundred
times
he
had
kept
away
from
her
all
the
day
had
busied
himself
with
his
sailors
with
his
steward
with
the
condition
of
the
place
but
he
longed
to
see
that
smile
which
even
in
its
malice
was
sweeter
to
him
than
all
the
kindness
of
others
to
hear
again
that
voice
which
was
music
to
his
ear
even
in
its
chill
indifferent
mockeries
he
had
an
intuitive
belief
which
had
been
shaken
but
not
destroyed
by
his
own
failure
that
in
her
nature
there
were
depths
to
be
reached
passions
to
be
awakened
though
a
bland
and
cruel
indifference
at
present
veiled
them
he
had
been
ruthlessly
betrayed
by
her
coquetry
profoundly
wounded
by
her
coldness
but
he
believed
in
her
still
even
still
believed
in
himself
as
the
man
whom
ultimately
she
would
love
he
had
returned
to
europe
with
the
resolution
never
to
be
in
her
presence
except
when
the
hazards
of
society
should
bring
them
perforce
in
the
same
atmosphere
but
at
the
first
charm
of
her
regard
he
had
forgotten
all
his
resolves
lost
all
his
wisdom
life
only
seemed
worth
living
if
he
could
hear
that
one
voice
so
sweet
in
its
modulations
so
chilly
in
its
perfect
harmony
it
was
perhaps
because
he
was
one
of
the
few
men
who
could
gratify
all
wishes
caprices
and
ambitions
as
fast
as
such
arose
that
this
one
thing
wholly
denied
to
him
wholly
inaccessible
had
such
force
of
attraction
for
him
yet
he
was
bitterly
angered
against
himself
for
his
own
submission
she
was
but
a
supreme
coquette
a
woman
du
despite
all
her
charm
but
she
could
make
her
careless
little
nod
or
a
smile
more
prized
from
her
than
the
utmost
tenderness
of
other
women
ever
was
there
was
about
her
that
air
as
of
one
so
wholly
indifferent
to
all
the
vulgarities
which
others
esteem
triumphs
that
when
she
ever
deigned
to
notice
that
a
man
existed
he
was
more
flattered
than
by
the
fondest
concessions
of
his
most
ardent
adorers
she
had
been
assailed
by
all
the
powers
and
vanities
of
passion
but
she
had
always
given
it
at
most
that
cool
little
smile
sometimes
the
smile
had
been
compassionate
more
often
it
had
been
cruel
women
had
succumbed
to
him
as
roses
fall
before
the
touch
of
a
careless
hand
for
this
reason
the
chillness
of
nadine
napraxine
which
seemed
chastity
had
had
so
strong
an
attraction
for
him
that
for
awhile
it
had
seemed
to
him
sweeter
to
wait
upon
its
caprices
than
to
obtain
fuller
response
from
them
but
no
man
tarries
long
at
this
stage
of
his
affections
and
the
time
had
come
when
he
had
grown
impatient
of
a
pursuit
without
end
of
an
allegiance
without
recompense
it
was
like
an
empty
cup
of
exquisite
form
and
transparent
beauty
for
ever
without
wine
in
it
to
the
connoisseur
the
gem
is
perfect
thus
but
to
those
athirst
it
brings
little
delight
the
unshuttered
windows
of
millo
were
glistening
with
light
which
shone
through
the
thickets
of
and
bay
as
he
approached
the
house
and
a
flood
of
light
was
poured
out
shining
on
the
stone
carpeted
and
screened
closely
by
awnings
from
the
air
of
night
after
a
year
and
a
half
spent
on
tropic
seas
and
in
desert
lands
the
return
to
society
has
always
a
flavour
was
it
worth
while
he
thought
to
leave
all
the
routine
and
tedium
and
emptiness
of
the
world
only
to
drift
back
again
into
its
formalities
and
follies
he
had
however
no
choice
left
in
the
matter
for
the
servants
in
the
antechamber
were
bowing
low
to
him
and
taking
his
furred
coat
from
him
and
in
another
moment
the
duchesse
de
vannes
was
welcoming
him
with
all
the
genuine
pleasure
which
a
hostess
feels
in
having
the
first
visit
from
a
person
long
absent
and
high
enough
in
the
favour
to
make
his
return
to
the
world
an
event
of
social
interest
and
of
public
importance
aurore
de
vannes
called
by
her
friends
was
a
very
pretty
woman
as
much
and
as
delicately
painted
as
the
fan
she
carried
she
wore
a
marvellous
costume
of
velvet
blent
with
satin
and
had
japonicas
in
her
hair
and
at
her
bosom
she
wore
also
some
very
fine
rubies
when
he
entered
the
of
millo
there
were
a
dozen
persons
assembled
there
most
of
whom
he
knew
but
amongst
them
was
not
the
princess
napraxine
there
was
lamentation
for
her
absence
but
no
surprise
at
it
because
her
caprices
were
so
well
known
as
he
entered
a
little
note
had
entered
behind
him
when
mme
de
vannes
had
said
all
her
pretty
greetings
to
him
she
glanced
at
it
désolée
migraine
temps
détestable
she
murmured
as
she
ran
her
eyes
over
it
course
she
said
aloud
is
always
way
she
does
it
on
purpose
she
loves
to
disappoint
people
she
was
out
riding
this
afternoon
i
saw
her
in
the
distance
with
boris
seliedoff
she
treated
the
empress
in
that
fashion
last
winter
at
petersburg
and
when
the
dames
du
palais
told
her
that
the
tsarina
was
so
displeased
that
she
would
exclude
her
from
court
nadine
said
to
them
quite
simply
trop
de
bonté
je
si
mal
à
ces
has
she
been
excluded
asked
one
of
the
guests
cried
the
duchesse
de
vannes
see
you
do
not
know
her
no
empress
in
the
world
would
dare
to
exclude
her
imagine
how
she
would
avenge
herself
courts
can
not
afford
to
be
brave
nowadays
othmar
heard
every
syllable
she
said
as
he
conversed
with
de
vannes
a
tall
man
of
some
years
old
with
a
look
of
extreme
distinction
and
of
as
supreme
fatigue
is
boris
seliedoff
he
thought
with
the
restless
jealousy
of
an
unsatisfied
passion
he
regretted
his
tent
in
tartary
the
elegant
rooms
the
perfumed
air
the
pretty
women
the
low
buzz
of
conversation
the
little
breaks
of
laughter
the
artificiality
the
monotony
of
the
whole
thing
wearied
him
already
the
dinner
was
gay
and
even
brilliant
to
him
alone
it
seemed
tedious
why
had
she
not
come
he
thought
and
that
disappointment
alone
occupied
him
he
was
angered
that
she
should
have
so
much
power
to
make
pluie
et
le
beau
of
his
time
and
of
his
moods
othmar
cured
by
central
asia
said
one
of
the
guests
to
the
duchesse
de
vannes
who
looked
across
the
table
at
him
and
answered
should
say
not
he
would
hardly
be
within
five
leagues
of
la
jacquemerille
if
he
were
so
besides
nadine
has
a
power
of
making
herself
remembered
which
i
have
seen
in
no
one
else
it
is
because
she
remembers
nothing
herself
the
law
of
contrasts
is
the
law
of
affinity
napraxine
is
the
only
woman
in
whom
virtue
does
not
look
ridiculous
said
an
old
gentleman
to
his
neighbour
overhearing
her
name
then
true
this
is
because
it
is
not
virtue
at
all
but
something
much
more
disdainful
and
unapproachable
have
you
seen
a
peacock
ravage
a
he
does
not
care
for
any
one
of
the
flowers
but
all
the
same
the
carnations
and
roses
and
geraniums
fall
in
showers
as
he
goes
strewing
them
right
and
left
and
drawing
his
plumes
carelessly
over
the
waste
he
has
made
behind
him
her
lovers
are
no
more
to
madame
napraxine
than
the
flowers
to
the
peacock
but
the
result
is
the
same
that
a
quality
you
would
rank
very
highly
asked
the
person
next
him
depends
on
your
standard
he
answered
is
a
power
which
is
to
her
just
what
plumage
is
to
the
peacock
something
quite
beyond
imitation
and
royal
in
its
disdainful
beauty
i
did
not
think
men
were
ever
hopelessly
in
love
in
this
century
but
with
her
i
perceive
that
they
are
so
began
the
other
repeated
the
old
diplomat
reminds
me
of
a
man
i
once
knew
who
was
a
collector
of
miniatures
the
collection
has
been
dispersed
now
by
unworthy
heirs
but
some
twenty
years
ago
it
was
a
marvel
of
completeness
every
admirable
miniaturist
whom
the
world
has
possessed
was
represented
in
it
by
his
finest
examples
it
had
taken
him
years
and
more
millions
to
make
it
what
it
was
any
one
else
would
have
thought
it
perfect
he
did
not
because
he
had
not
an
example
amongst
it
of
karl
huth
you
may
never
have
heard
of
karl
huth
i
never
had
he
was
a
german
miniaturist
of
the
sixteenth
century
he
dwelt
at
daunenberg
a
small
place
on
the
elbe
there
is
nothing
of
him
in
any
museum
and
there
was
supposed
to
be
nothing
of
him
anywhere
but
his
tradition
for
years
my
friend
hunted
north
and
south
germany
for
a
karl
huth
at
length
such
was
his
perseverance
that
he
did
find
an
undeniable
karl
huth
in
the
family
of
a
tradesman
at
grieffenhagen
in
a
little
portrait
of
a
woman
on
ivory
the
size
of
a
walnut
and
signed
and
dated
his
joy
was
immense
but
alas
it
was
of
short
duration
the
burgomaster
who
owned
it
would
not
part
with
it
my
friend
offered
sums
untold
for
this
three
inches
of
ivory
would
have
sold
his
estates
to
purchase
it
stopped
at
nothing
in
his
frantic
offers
but
the
burgomaster
was
rich
too
and
inflexible
he
would
not
sell
the
karl
huth
there
was
some
fable
in
his
family
about
it
two
obstinacies
met
with
a
shock
like
the
foreheads
of
two
elephants
in
combat
of
course
the
teuton
obstinacy
beat
the
gaul
the
karl
huth
remained
in
the
possession
and
my
friend
had
such
an
excess
of
rage
and
despair
that
it
brought
on
gout
and
killed
him
in
an
inn
in
that
obscure
pomeranian
town
all
because
with
three
thousand
five
hundred
famous
miniatures
he
failed
to
acquire
one
obscure
example
now
madame
napraxine
is
certainly
not
obscure
nevertheless
she
is
the
karl
huth
of
othmar
he
is
one
of
those
men
who
can
command
and
enjoy
everything
therefore
of
course
he
has
set
his
heart
on
the
only
woman
probably
in
europe
who
will
not
smile
on
him
all
his
grand
collection
became
worthless
to
my
poor
friend
when
once
he
failed
to
include
in
it
that
single
karl
huth
othmar
meanwhile
unconscious
that
they
talked
of
him
even
unconscious
that
his
passion
for
his
friend
wife
had
been
ever
suspected
by
his
world
found
the
dinner
tedious
and
was
not
distracted
by
his
neighbours
both
of
whom
were
lovely
women
when
they
returned
to
the
salons
at
the
further
end
of
the
great
central
which
was
all
white
and
silver
with
satin
panels
embroidered
with
silver
thread
and
doors
made
of
mirrors
painted
with
groups
of
flowers
there
was
seated
all
alone
at
one
of
the
little
tables
a
very
young
girl
who
wore
a
plain
white
gown
with
a
plain
black
sash
tied
around
her
waist
and
a
black
ribbon
holding
up
the
thick
masses
of
her
fair
hair
is
cendrillon
thought
othmar
moved
to
a
vague
interest
as
he
recalled
the
story
which
melville
had
told
and
he
looked
on
her
more
attentively
as
she
rose
at
the
entrance
of
the
duchess
he
saw
that
she
was
very
tall
for
her
age
the
slim
straight
unornamented
frock
became
her
she
had
neither
awkwardness
nor
neither
much
timidity
nor
any
there
was
a
look
about
her
of
spirited
but
restrained
life
which
was
pathetic
the
look
of
any
young
animal
which
is
too
early
and
too
rudely
tamed
child
thought
othmar
in
an
involuntary
pity
as
he
saw
the
duchess
go
up
to
her
tap
her
carelessly
on
the
shoulder
with
a
fan
present
her
to
another
lady
and
with
that
other
lady
turn
away
indifferently
after
a
few
words
the
girl
curtsied
low
with
perfect
grace
and
resumed
her
seat
she
appeared
used
to
be
forgotten
she
sat
quite
still
neither
embarrassed
by
neglect
or
solicitous
of
attention
she
might
have
been
a
statue
but
for
her
eyes
of
a
luminous
golden
brown
shaded
by
long
black
lashes
and
her
mouth
like
a
rose
which
had
made
him
call
her
a
greuze
picture
as
she
had
passed
him
in
the
boat
she
had
looked
much
happier
in
the
boat
than
she
looked
now
in
the
othmar
watched
her
a
little
while
no
one
approached
her
the
men
present
did
not
care
for
the
women
it
is
needless
to
say
cared
still
less
the
duchesse
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
trouble
herself
about
a
child
who
was
still
in
a
convent
and
would
soon
be
in
one
for
the
rest
of
her
days
she
was
not
averse
to
such
an
evidence
of
her
own
charity
as
her
young
cousin
presented
sitting
there
carefully
dressed
admirably
educated
in
living
testimony
of
the
benevolence
of
aurore
de
vannes
but
there
was
no
need
for
more
than
the
tap
with
the
fan
and
the
indifferent
ce
soir
petite
othmar
waited
some
ten
or
twelve
minutes
then
approached
his
hostess
will
you
do
me
the
honour
to
present
me
to
mdlle
de
valogne
she
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
yes
why
not
but
how
did
you
know
her
name
and
she
is
only
a
child
at
sacré
coeur
told
me
her
sad
little
story
and
of
all
your
amiability
towards
her
surely
she
will
soon
be
a
very
beautiful
woman
pas
said
the
duchess
somewhat
irritably
is
always
romancing
you
know
there
is
nothing
to
be
romantic
about
she
is
destined
to
the
religious
life
it
was
her
grandmother
wish
and
is
her
own
as
for
presenting
you
to
her
she
is
only
a
child
it
would
not
be
well
to
make
her
think
herself
in
the
world
if
you
would
excuse
me
present
me
duchesse
he
persisted
assure
you
i
do
not
eat
children
and
if
she
be
doomed
to
take
the
veil
so
soon
the
world
will
lose
her
anyhow
but
will
you
have
the
heart
to
cut
off
all
that
hair
will
always
have
your
own
way
said
madame
de
vannes
who
knew
very
well
that
he
did
not
have
it
where
most
he
cared
then
she
took
him
across
to
where
her
young
cousin
sat
and
said
count
othmar
wishes
to
know
you
he
is
a
friend
of
monsignor
melville
the
girl
made
him
the
same
grand
curtsy
which
she
had
made
before
only
a
little
less
low
than
she
had
given
to
the
lady
then
she
seated
herself
once
more
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
first
as
we
wait
for
a
royal
person
to
do
so
he
spoke
to
her
of
melville
divining
that
the
way
to
her
confidence
would
be
through
his
regard
for
the
early
period
of
her
childhood
she
listened
with
pleasure
to
his
praises
of
her
grandmother
friend
and
answered
him
in
few
syllables
but
the
restraint
seemed
to
him
the
result
neither
of
timidity
nor
of
want
of
intelligence
but
of
the
reserve
which
had
been
imposed
upon
her
alike
at
her
convent
and
here
at
millo
where
no
one
heeded
her
unless
the
duc
threw
her
a
glance
or
the
duchesse
a
petulant
word
of
censure
it
was
easy
to
see
that
on
a
nature
formed
for
light
and
laughter
the
sense
of
being
unneeded
and
undesired
in
the
home
of
others
had
early
cast
shadows
too
deep
for
childhood
very
handsome
she
is
he
thought
as
he
spoke
of
melville
and
his
many
noble
works
close
to
her
he
could
see
the
exceeding
regularity
of
her
features
the
splendour
of
her
eyes
the
purity
of
her
complexion
which
was
not
the
narcissus
whiteness
of
nadine
napraxine
but
that
childlike
fairness
under
which
the
colour
mantles
at
any
passing
thought
or
any
effort
or
exercise
her
form
too
had
all
the
slenderness
and
indecision
of
youth
but
it
had
also
the
certainty
of
a
magnificent
womanhood
her
low
dress
showed
her
white
shoulders
her
childlike
breast
her
beautiful
throat
that
to
be
wasted
in
a
cloister
he
thought
with
repugnance
it
seemed
a
sin
against
nature
finest
work
youth
most
gracious
grace
to
be
sixteen
years
old
and
to
have
a
face
as
fair
as
a
flower
and
to
be
the
last
of
a
great
race
and
yet
to
be
doomed
to
be
joyless
loverless
childless
from
birth
unto
death
because
a
little
gold
and
silver
were
lacking
to
her
to
the
master
of
millions
it
seemed
the
cruelest
irony
of
fate
that
he
had
ever
encountered
why
should
the
absurd
codes
and
prejudices
of
the
world
make
him
powerless
to
give
this
unhappy
child
out
of
his
abundance
the
little
which
she
would
need
to
take
her
place
amidst
those
common
human
joys
which
the
poorest
can
attain
but
which
the
selfishness
of
man
and
the
customs
of
society
forbade
to
her
merely
because
she
had
been
nobly
born
he
was
thinking
of
her
fate
all
the
while
that
he
talked
to
her
of
melville
he
was
thinking
of
that
supple
slender
form
disguised
under
the
nun
heavy
garb
of
that
abundant
hair
shorn
and
falling
to
the
stone
floor
could
those
gay
idle
spendthrift
people
who
condemned
her
so
lightly
to
such
a
sacrifice
not
surrender
one
of
their
luxuries
one
of
their
follies
to
save
her
then
he
pictured
to
himself
with
a
smile
at
his
own
whimsical
conceit
the
tailors
bills
of
madame
de
vannes
curtailed
her
caprices
sacrificed
her
equipages
diminished
her
de
discontinued
her
superfluous
jewels
sold
to
furnish
with
the
result
attained
a
dower
to
her
portionless
cousin
these
good
people
called
themselves
christians
nevertheless
such
generosity
would
have
seemed
to
them
as
impossible
as
to
go
out
on
to
the
boulevards
in
the
goatskin
of
john
the
baptist
would
there
ever
be
a
religion
that
should
influence
the
lives
of
its
professors
christianity
had
had
its
own
way
for
nigh
two
thousand
years
and
had
scarcely
left
a
mark
on
the
world
so
far
as
practical
renunciation
went
while
he
mused
thus
he
talked
lightly
and
kindly
to
the
girl
but
he
met
with
little
response
the
convent
education
had
taught
her
silence
and
she
thought
that
he
had
only
come
to
her
side
because
he
had
pitied
her
solitude
that
thought
made
her
shy
and
proud
with
all
his
good
will
he
failed
to
make
much
way
into
her
friendship
or
to
elicit
much
more
than
monosyllabic
replies
and
he
would
have
felt
his
benevolence
wearisome
had
it
not
been
that
there
was
so
much
true
loveliness
in
her
features
and
in
her
form
that
he
was
not
glad
of
his
release
when
she
was
called
by
the
duchesse
to
the
piano
you
make
anything
of
yseulte
said
the
duc
de
vannes
to
him
is
the
true
of
the
novelist
and
dramatist
she
knows
nothing
beyond
the
four
walls
of
the
convent
it
is
a
type
fast
disappearing
even
with
us
under
the
influence
of
american
women
and
english
romances
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
not
to
be
regretted
it
is
something
at
least
to
have
a
girlhood
like
a
white
rose
you
are
going
to
set
the
rose
to
wither
before
the
sanctuary
of
marie
said
othmar
still
moved
by
his
one
idea
the
duc
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
is
my
wife
affair
myself
i
think
it
is
a
pity
the
child
will
be
a
magnificent
woman
but
then
you
see
she
has
no
dower
where
can
she
go
except
to
the
cloisters
listen
she
sings
well
she
was
singing
then
and
her
voice
rose
with
singular
richness
like
the
notes
of
a
nightingale
smiting
the
silence
of
a
golden
southern
noon
the
quality
of
her
voice
was
pure
and
strong
with
a
sound
in
it
as
of
unshed
tears
of
restrained
and
perhaps
unconscious
emotion
she
will
only
sing
the
and
the
thought
othmar
no
one
will
hear
her
except
a
few
scores
of
stupid
women
who
will
succeed
in
making
her
as
and
as
stupid
as
themselves
what
she
rendered
was
the
sweetest
of
all
the
simple
noëls
written
by
roumanille
the
song
of
the
blind
child
who
begs
her
mother
to
take
her
to
see
the
enfant
jésus
in
the
church
and
to
whom
the
mother
long
replies
in
chiding
and
hardness
of
heart
use
since
thou
canst
not
see
had
set
the
naive
and
pathetic
words
to
music
which
was
penetrated
with
that
which
has
in
it
pleurs
du
peuple
et
les
fleurs
du
printemps
and
the
voice
of
the
girl
was
pure
tender
and
solemn
in
unison
with
what
she
treated
sais
tombeau
seul
finit
ma
voie
obscure
je
sais
encor
que
je
ne
verrai
pas
divine
créature
ta
face
besoin
pour
adorer
et
croire
si
mes
yeux
sont
a
te
voir
impuissants
mes
mains
ô
dieu
de
gloire
te
toucheront
à
ses
genoux
pleure
si
fort
et
prie
sur
un
tel
ton
air
si
déchirant
que
la
mère
attendrie
plus
dit
non
oh
comme
la
pauvrette
en
entrant
dans
la
grotte
en
tressaillait
de
jésus
sur
son
coeur
elle
mit
la
menotte
elle
voyait
of
all
those
who
listened
to
her
the
old
minister
who
had
spoken
of
karl
huth
and
othmar
himself
were
the
only
persons
touched
by
the
likeness
of
the
words
of
the
noël
to
the
destiny
which
awaited
the
singer
of
it
sais
tombeau
seul
finit
ma
voie
obscure
othmar
repeated
to
himself
child
there
will
be
no
miracle
wrought
for
her
it
seemed
to
him
pathetic
and
even
cruel
she
had
sung
with
science
and
accuracy
which
were
in
contrast
with
the
very
youthful
cadence
of
her
voice
and
when
she
ceased
there
was
a
murmur
of
applause
she
blushed
a
little
and
with
a
composure
that
was
almost
dignity
accepted
the
compliments
paid
her
and
went
back
without
a
word
to
her
seat
would
make
a
name
for
herself
as
an
artist
if
she
were
not
the
last
comtesse
de
valogne
thought
othmar
child
it
is
hard
to
bear
all
the
harness
and
curb
of
rank
and
have
none
of
its
gilded
oats
to
eat
a
pretty
was
now
singing
a
song
of
judic
with
even
more
suggestion
by
gesture
and
of
glance
than
the
original
version
of
it
gave
the
air
of
the
rippled
with
her
silvery
notes
and
their
response
of
subdued
laughter
everyone
forgot
mdlle
de
valogne
and
the
provençal
noël
when
othmar
looked
again
for
her
she
was
gone
the
salon
saw
her
no
more
that
night
were
soon
tired
othmar
said
the
duchesse
what
should
you
find
to
say
to
a
child
from
a
convent
she
has
not
two
ideas
speaks
little
certainly
he
answered
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
from
want
of
ideas
and
even
if
she
have
no
ideas
what
does
a
beautiful
woman
want
with
them
and
she
is
beautiful
thought
you
liked
clever
women
oh
what
a
comprehensive
word
it
is
like
that
balloon
they
advertise
which
you
can
either
fold
up
in
your
pocket
or
float
as
high
as
the
moon
as
for
mdlle
de
valogne
i
should
think
she
was
very
intelligent
to
judge
by
her
brow
and
her
eyes
but
convents
do
not
nourish
their
pupils
on
rénan
and
huxley
said
the
duchess
with
a
charming
affectation
of
ignorance
that
is
the
man
who
writes
so
many
volumes
about
himself
to
explain
why
he
can
not
bring
himself
to
believe
some
story
about
an
almond
bough
that
swallowed
snakes
when
voltaire
began
that
sort
of
thing
it
seemed
shocking
but
it
was
new
nowadays
it
is
not
new
and
nobody
is
shocked
it
is
only
tiresome
you
madame
who
laugh
yet
respect
the
church
enough
to
sacrifice
a
virgin
to
it
as
the
greek
to
the
minotaur
is
no
other
retreat
possible
for
girls
of
good
family
who
are
portionless
said
the
duchess
very
positively
there
are
many
men
who
do
not
marry
for
a
dower
but
not
with
us
it
would
be
quite
impossible
an
unheard
of
thing
said
the
duchesse
scandalised
at
such
a
suggestive
violation
of
all
etiquette
and
family
dignity
from
time
immemorial
the
younger
sons
or
the
unmarriageable
daughters
of
the
valogne
of
the
creusac
of
the
of
all
the
great
races
whose
blood
met
in
this
child
had
hidden
their
narrowed
fates
with
decorum
and
stateliness
in
the
refuge
of
the
cloisters
why
should
she
because
she
had
been
born
in
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
rebel
against
so
just
a
disposal
and
she
did
not
rebel
at
all
would
not
unless
some
man
made
love
to
her
and
put
rebellion
in
her
head
that
man
would
not
be
othmar
he
had
only
one
thought
nadine
napraxine
if
she
had
not
been
sure
of
that
she
would
not
even
have
presented
him
to
her
young
cousin
for
she
was
a
very
proud
woman
despite
her
frivolity
and
to
seek
a
rich
alliance
for
a
poor
relative
would
have
seemed
to
her
the
last
of
degradations
her
own
people
and
her
husband
had
always
married
as
sovereigns
do
accepting
and
conferring
equal
advantages
has
the
right
to
be
as
proud
as
it
chooses
so
long
as
it
accepts
nothing
when
once
it
has
accepted
anything
it
has
become
mendicity
had
said
often
the
old
marquise
de
creusac
to
her
granddaughter
and
yseulte
would
not
do
dishonour
to
that
lesson
can
trust
her
implicitly
said
madame
de
vannes
once
to
her
husband
who
had
answered
yes
my
dear
that
is
the
result
of
an
education
when
your
blanchette
and
toinon
are
at
her
age
they
will
know
everything
objectionable
under
the
sun
but
they
will
not
let
you
know
that
they
know
it
you
are
bringing
them
up
chapter
viii
yseulte
de
valogne
waking
the
next
morning
and
looking
through
the
little
panes
of
her
high
window
in
the
roof
at
the
landscape
which
the
red
leaves
of
the
canadian
vine
framed
in
crimson
was
conscious
of
a
new
interest
in
her
life
some
one
she
did
not
know
whom
for
in
her
confusion
she
had
not
heard
his
name
had
spoken
to
her
with
kindness
and
that
deference
to
her
incipient
womanhood
which
is
the
sweetest
flattery
to
a
very
young
girl
othmar
with
the
grace
of
his
manner
the
seriousness
and
coldness
which
made
him
different
to
the
men
of
his
time
and
his
handsome
features
to
which
an
habitual
reserve
had
given
that
expression
of
and
of
melancholy
which
most
attracts
her
sex
had
seemed
to
her
imagination
like
some
gracious
knight
of
old
bending
to
pity
her
loneliness
and
to
succour
that
timidity
which
was
in
so
much
due
to
her
pride
and
her
unwillingness
to
be
regarded
with
compassion
and
to
her
dread
lest
she
should
seem
to
seek
attention
she
thought
of
him
with
a
vague
personal
interest
stronger
than
any
she
had
felt
in
her
simple
and
monotonous
life
since
her
childhood
on
the
ile
louis
had
become
to
her
like
an
old
book
of
prayer
shut
up
unused
with
the
lavender
and
of
long
dead
summers
faded
and
dried
inside
it
though
she
was
only
sixteen
that
childhood
seemed
so
far
so
very
far
away
it
would
have
appeared
to
blanchette
and
toinon
with
their
artificial
excited
little
lives
a
dull
and
austere
childhood
enough
passed
beside
the
infirmities
and
incapacities
of
age
and
with
no
other
active
pleasure
than
to
gather
marguerites
on
the
grass
islands
of
the
seine
or
to
hear
a
magnificat
sung
at
notre
dame
the
rooms
they
lived
in
had
been
narrow
and
dark
their
food
had
been
of
the
simplest
their
days
regulated
with
exact
and
severe
precision
but
she
had
been
so
happy
when
her
grandmother
with
the
white
hair
like
spun
silk
and
the
thin
small
hands
on
which
one
great
diamond
sparkled
sole
relic
of
a
splendid
past
said
with
a
smile
bien
fait
mon
enfant
all
the
universe
could
have
added
nothing
to
her
content
when
the
old
man
servant
bénoît
had
taken
her
out
to
the
sainte
chapelle
or
the
graves
at
the
abbaye
and
had
told
her
tales
of
how
her
forefathers
had
died
on
the
scaffold
in
the
on
the
of
jemappes
or
in
the
slaughter
of
quiberon
she
had
known
that
purest
of
all
pride
which
rejoices
in
the
honour
and
loyalty
of
the
dead
who
have
begotten
us
all
the
air
about
her
had
been
redolent
of
fidelity
of
courage
of
dignity
she
had
breathed
in
that
fine
clear
atmosphere
of
integrity
as
the
transparent
dianthus
drinks
in
the
which
the
sunbeams
pierce
with
vivifying
gold
when
the
marquise
had
sometimes
taken
out
of
old
coffers
antique
brocades
dusky
old
jewels
faded
yellow
letters
perhaps
a
ribbon
and
a
star
of
some
extinct
order
once
worn
at
marly
or
at
amboise
the
child
had
listened
with
reverent
ear
and
beating
heart
to
the
stories
which
went
with
the
relics
and
keepsakes
and
it
had
always
seemed
to
her
as
if
some
perfume
of
the
past
entered
her
very
veins
as
its
fragrance
is
poured
upwards
from
the
root
into
the
flower
nor
had
it
been
always
melancholy
that
innocent
tranquil
life
gentlemen
of
the
old
courtly
habits
had
made
their
bow
humbly
in
those
narrow
rooms
and
the
old
had
laughed
sometimes
beneath
the
sad
serenity
of
losses
nobly
borne
there
had
been
merry
days
when
bénoît
had
taken
her
in
one
of
the
boats
which
crossed
the
seine
in
summer
and
had
rowed
to
one
of
those
quiet
nooks
of
which
he
had
the
secret
and
had
landed
with
her
amidst
the
tall
hay
grasses
and
had
set
her
noonday
meal
there
a
little
fruit
and
roll
of
bread
watching
the
poplars
quiver
in
the
light
and
the
women
work
upon
the
shore
and
the
clumsy
brown
brigs
come
and
go
on
the
broad
breast
of
the
river
and
she
had
clasped
a
great
sheaf
of
may
and
daisies
and
kingcups
in
her
arms
and
had
run
hither
and
thither
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
limbs
set
free
and
eyes
delighted
and
had
cried
her
delight
aloud
to
the
old
man
who
had
nodded
and
smiled
and
said
oui
beau
but
had
thought
with
a
pang
at
his
faithful
heart
jeunesse
savait
then
whilst
she
was
still
a
young
child
there
had
fallen
across
her
life
the
darkness
of
the
terrible
the
marquise
de
creusac
had
been
at
once
too
brave
and
too
poor
to
quit
paris
when
the
wall
of
iron
and
of
fire
had
closed
in
around
it
her
sons
had
died
one
at
the
cavalry
charge
of
fræschweiler
the
other
during
the
siege
of
strasburg
she
herself
never
rose
from
her
bed
during
that
ghastly
winter
and
her
last
breath
left
her
lips
as
the
prussians
entered
paris
the
horror
of
that
time
could
never
wholly
pass
from
the
mind
of
yseulte
bénoît
had
travelled
with
her
to
the
château
of
bois
les
rois
and
placed
her
under
the
roof
of
her
only
living
relative
aurore
de
vannes
who
herself
was
momentarily
saddened
and
touched
by
the
misfortunes
of
the
country
and
the
loss
of
many
of
her
kinsmen
and
in
that
chastened
mood
was
kinder
to
the
little
friendless
fugitive
than
she
might
have
been
at
another
and
less
desperate
time
all
that
time
seemed
very
far
away
to
yseulte
now
to
earliest
youth
a
few
years
seems
like
the
gap
of
a
century
bénoît
was
dead
now
like
the
mistress
he
had
adored
and
served
with
that
loyal
service
which
in
this
later
time
one
class
has
lost
the
power
to
inspire
and
the
other
class
has
lost
the
capacity
to
render
but
those
happy
midsummer
holidays
on
the
islets
of
the
seine
were
always
in
her
mind
whenever
she
felt
the
touch
of
the
fresh
air
or
smelt
the
scent
of
growing
leaves
they
had
spread
a
fragrance
like
that
of
summer
all
over
her
memories
of
childhood
she
pitied
blanchette
and
toinon
who
cared
nothing
for
daisies
and
kingcups
who
tired
so
soon
of
their
costly
playthings
who
knew
their
trouville
and
biarritz
by
heart
who
when
they
played
at
their
games
were
either
peevish
or
bored
and
who
looked
with
all
the
scorn
of
fashionable
on
a
toilette
which
was
a
season
out
of
date
blanchette
and
toinon
would
die
without
ever
having
been
young
their
cousin
who
at
sixteen
was
still
entirely
a
child
had
to
die
to
the
world
before
she
had
begun
to
live
she
leaned
out
of
her
window
in
the
chill
of
the
early
morning
and
she
watched
the
sea
mists
curl
up
and
drift
away
before
the
sun
the
mountains
come
forth
slowly
from
the
clouds
obscuring
them
the
light
touch
and
reveal
one
by
one
the
low
white
bastides
the
grey
olive
yards
the
bosquets
of
orange
and
lemon
the
fields
where
the
young
corn
already
was
spreading
the
fantastic
buildings
which
diversified
and
vulgarised
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
the
grey
towers
of
pharamond
sober
and
severe
amidst
its
ilex
woods
by
contrast
with
the
coquetteries
and
motley
phantasies
of
its
neighbours
wonder
she
thought
for
the
hundredth
time
it
were
only
because
he
pitied
me
that
he
talked
to
me
she
went
on
wondering
who
he
was
what
he
was
she
did
not
even
know
that
he
owned
pharamond
and
dared
ask
no
one
about
him
all
the
gay
thoughtless
inquisitive
questions
which
youth
loves
to
put
whilst
often
too
impatient
to
wait
for
an
answer
to
them
had
been
too
perpetually
frozen
on
her
lips
for
silence
not
to
have
become
a
second
nature
to
her
you
can
observe
is
well
her
grandmother
had
often
said
to
her
is
the
wheat
you
have
gleaned
and
you
have
a
right
to
it
but
never
gain
knowledge
by
asking
questions
it
is
the
short
cut
across
the
fields
which
only
trespassers
take
at
the
convent
any
interrogations
which
she
had
been
tempted
to
make
had
been
repressed
as
too
apposite
to
be
convenient
and
of
the
duchesse
de
vannes
she
would
have
no
more
have
asked
a
question
or
a
favour
than
she
would
have
asked
one
of
the
lay
figures
on
which
the
duchesse
marvellous
costumes
were
built
up
bit
by
bit
as
idea
succeeded
to
idea
in
the
brains
of
great
artists
of
the
toilette
she
had
scarcely
heard
a
dozen
sentences
from
madame
aurore
in
the
years
through
which
she
had
spent
her
summer
vacations
at
their
great
castle
in
the
vosges
a
lonely
place
where
she
had
usually
only
the
as
companions
but
in
winter
at
millo
she
had
been
always
happy
for
near
millo
dwelt
her
a
savoyarde
who
had
become
since
the
time
when
a
poor
young
unwedded
mother
astray
on
the
mercy
of
paris
she
had
been
glad
to
give
her
breast
to
the
motherless
child
of
the
comtesse
de
valogne
through
the
influence
and
aid
of
the
marquise
de
creusac
the
woman
nicole
had
ultimately
married
her
lover
a
sturdy
peasant
of
the
environs
of
nice
and
by
thrift
and
hard
work
and
good
luck
and
good
husbandry
combined
they
now
owned
a
bastide
and
an
and
could
receive
petite
comtesse
with
honey
and
cream
and
conserves
of
their
own
manufactures
they
had
no
children
and
mlle
de
valogne
still
filled
in
the
heart
of
her
the
place
which
had
been
empty
and
cold
when
a
baby
had
gasped
out
its
last
breath
of
feeble
life
in
a
paris
hospital
sixteen
years
before
is
the
good
of
it
all
the
is
dead
and
gone
said
nicole
sandroz
many
a
time
looking
over
her
hives
and
her
and
her
green
peas
all
blooming
for
the
paris
market
but
this
mood
was
transient
the
was
not
to
be
recalled
by
regret
and
the
solid
delight
of
early
vegetables
and
their
value
remained
to
her
she
was
a
good
woman
though
hard
in
some
ways
and
greedy
but
she
was
the
only
creature
who
gave
yseulte
de
valogne
anything
of
the
comfort
of
human
affection
and
tender
blind
unreasoning
admiration
to
nicole
enfant
la
comtesse
was
an
object
of
honest
adoration
to
be
waited
on
worshipped
petted
slaved
for
if
need
be
and
this
wholly
sincere
if
clumsy
devotion
had
always
been
to
the
starved
heart
of
the
girl
as
the
one
scrap
of
moss
on
the
frozen
sea
and
shore
is
to
the
lonely
and
lost
voyager
when
the
dark
face
of
the
niçoise
presented
itself
at
the
convent
gates
of
faïel
and
with
her
load
of
oranges
or
strawberries
of
camellias
or
roses
she
came
out
of
the
hot
sun
into
the
quietness
and
dusk
of
the
and
stretched
out
her
big
sturdy
arms
to
her
nursling
the
proud
eyes
of
yseulte
filled
with
tears
as
no
one
else
ever
saw
them
do
she
was
a
little
child
once
more
clinging
to
her
nurse
skirts
in
the
old
panelled
rooms
in
the
ile
louis
the
low
white
walls
of
the
bastide
were
set
upon
a
not
walk
from
millo
a
fragrant
pleasant
homely
place
with
violets
cultured
like
corn
and
roses
grown
like
for
the
of
paris
and
the
purchase
of
the
foreigners
in
nice
the
mere
presence
of
nicole
made
her
visits
to
the
southern
shore
longed
for
and
enjoyed
and
compensated
to
her
for
the
fretful
teazing
of
her
little
cousins
the
enmity
of
their
governesses
the
perpetual
sense
of
being
undesired
by
any
one
there
and
the
many
slights
which
the
indifference
of
her
hosts
made
them
careless
of
inflicting
aurore
de
vannes
would
have
said
if
remonstrated
with
that
the
girl
could
want
for
nothing
she
had
two
pretty
rooms
all
to
herself
and
a
piano
in
one
of
them
had
as
many
gowns
as
she
could
wear
though
of
course
at
her
age
they
were
the
frocks
of
a
and
could
pass
her
time
in
the
schoolroom
or
in
the
gardens
very
much
at
her
pleasure
she
could
even
drive
out
in
the
if
blanchette
and
toinon
did
not
want
it
the
existence
must
she
would
have
argued
at
any
rate
be
very
much
livelier
than
the
convent
in
the
first
winter
she
had
passed
at
millo
no
one
had
come
there
but
herself
and
she
had
spent
her
time
almost
wholly
with
her
later
on
when
the
house
was
full
as
it
was
now
she
obtained
in
her
holidays
a
large
amount
of
liberty
from
the
fact
that
it
was
no
one
especial
duty
to
look
after
her
she
used
her
freedom
innocently
enough
and
always
took
the
path
under
the
olives
which
led
to
the
of
the
sandroz
once
the
duchesse
had
said
to
her
irritably
charm
do
you
find
in
peasants
grubbing
among
peastalks
and
growing
salad
but
she
had
not
waited
for
an
answer
which
was
fortunate
as
yseulte
would
have
been
too
shy
to
give
the
true
one
that
they
loved
her
a
little
the
duchesse
concluded
that
the
governesses
of
her
children
did
their
duty
in
attending
on
her
young
cousin
the
governesses
however
were
willing
that
one
who
was
only
an
extra
charge
to
them
should
do
as
she
chose
so
long
as
she
brought
no
trouble
on
themselves
few
mornings
passed
without
her
finding
her
way
to
the
welcome
of
her
old
nurse
to
sit
at
pleasure
under
the
shadow
of
the
orange
leaves
or
drift
through
clear
water
in
the
big
market
boat
madame
de
vannes
was
as
the
world
in
general
would
have
said
very
generous
to
her
her
education
was
of
the
best
the
clothes
provided
for
her
were
elegant
and
suitable
her
linen
was
of
the
finest
her
boots
and
shoes
were
the
prettiest
possible
the
duchesse
did
everything
well
that
she
did
at
all
but
beyond
a
remark
that
her
hair
was
too
low
or
too
high
on
her
forehead
or
that
she
did
not
wear
the
right
gloves
with
the
right
frock
yseulte
could
scarcely
recall
twenty
phrases
that
she
had
heard
from
her
august
cousin
now
and
then
the
heart
of
the
girl
had
risen
in
an
impulse
of
ardour
towards
liberty
towards
independence
she
was
conscious
of
more
talent
than
the
manner
of
her
education
had
developed
in
a
vague
way
she
sometimes
fancied
the
world
might
hold
some
place
for
her
some
freedom
of
effort
or
attainment
but
all
the
habits
of
obedience
made
a
cage
for
her
as
surely
as
the
laws
made
one
her
grandmother
had
written
with
a
hand
half
paralysed
by
death
to
commend
her
to
the
care
of
her
relative
and
amongst
her
dying
words
the
command
aurore
as
you
have
obeyed
me
had
been
often
repeated
any
thought
of
rebellion
was
stifled
by
her
sense
of
duty
as
soon
as
it
arose
this
morning
as
she
leaned
out
of
her
window
she
could
see
the
white
house
of
the
sandroz
half
a
league
away
amongst
the
olive
foliage
and
what
was
still
more
to
her
the
tiny
bell
tower
of
a
little
whitewashed
church
the
parish
church
of
pharamond
in
whose
parish
millo
also
lay
the
one
cracked
bell
sounding
feebly
for
matins
recalled
her
to
the
present
hour
and
reminded
her
that
the
morrow
was
the
feast
day
of
cecilia
to
whom
the
building
was
dedicated
will
be
so
vexed
if
the
altar
be
not
dressed
she
thought
the
old
priest
of
millo
was
accustomed
to
look
to
her
for
that
service
the
duchesse
always
gave
him
two
thousand
francs
in
gold
for
his
poor
at
new
year
but
there
her
heed
of
her
vicar
ended
yseulte
who
had
no
gold
to
give
brought
him
flowers
and
boughs
for
his
little
dusky
lonely
place
where
only
a
few
fishermen
and
peasants
ever
knelt
and
she
sometimes
sang
at
his
offices
when
she
remembered
the
day
she
wasted
no
more
time
at
the
window
she
drank
the
cup
of
milk
and
ate
the
roll
which
the
maid
appointed
to
her
service
brought
and
putting
on
a
little
hat
of
fur
went
out
through
the
house
where
even
blanchette
and
toinon
were
still
asleep
and
only
a
few
of
the
under
servants
were
stirring
it
was
cold
but
already
grown
bright
with
sunshine
and
the
promise
of
a
warm
noonday
the
gardens
of
millo
with
their
autumn
luxuriance
still
prolonged
were
sparkling
with
sunbeams
and
their
aloes
and
cacti
pierced
with
broad
the
blue
clear
air
the
latest
roses
kissed
the
earliest
camellias
the
pink
the
amber
the
white
the
purple
of
groves
of
chrysanthemums
glowed
in
the
parterres
but
she
did
not
dare
to
give
them
even
a
glance
no
one
ever
plucked
a
flower
there
she
went
quickly
through
the
alleys
and
avenues
over
the
lawns
and
under
the
and
after
walking
about
a
mile
came
to
where
the
boundary
of
millo
was
fixed
by
a
high
wall
of
arbutus
and
only
the
small
iron
gate
which
othmar
had
unlocked
the
previous
night
gave
access
to
the
lands
of
pharamond
which
lay
beyond
will
be
sure
to
be
something
here
she
thought
as
she
turned
the
latch
of
the
gate
which
he
had
unthinkingly
left
open
and
passed
through
the
aperture
into
the
thick
ilex
wood
on
the
other
side
of
the
bearberry
wall
she
was
not
surprised
to
find
it
open
for
the
gardeners
of
the
two
houses
often
held
communication
and
she
had
been
constantly
permitted
by
those
of
pharamond
to
wander
about
its
grounds
and
pluck
its
commoner
plants
it
was
a
thing
she
had
done
a
hundred
times
in
the
winters
she
had
passed
at
millo
there
were
all
kinds
of
plants
growing
up
at
nicole
bastide
but
as
she
had
no
money
to
pay
the
child
had
always
felt
a
delicacy
in
asking
for
them
her
would
indeed
have
refused
her
nothing
but
to
take
as
a
gift
the
rose
or
the
which
the
sandroz
could
sell
so
highly
by
sending
them
away
in
little
tin
boxes
to
paris
would
have
appeared
to
the
generous
temper
of
the
last
of
the
valognes
a
very
ungenerous
act
othmar
who
had
slept
ill
rose
early
that
day
when
he
had
bathed
and
dressed
he
strolled
out
on
to
his
terrace
where
nadine
napraxine
had
eaten
her
strawberries
though
winter
the
morning
was
mild
the
sunrise
glorious
through
the
great
gloom
of
his
ilex
groves
he
could
see
the
sparkle
of
blue
waves
it
was
not
the
scenery
he
cared
most
for
he
liked
the
great
windy
shadowy
plains
of
eastern
europe
the
snow
of
mountains
more
sombre
and
severe
than
these
maritime
alps
the
gigantic
grey
walls
of
atlantic
rollers
breaking
on
rugged
rocks
of
spain
or
britanny
or
scotland
but
he
was
not
insensible
to
the
present
beauty
which
surrounded
him
if
it
were
brighter
and
paler
of
hue
gayer
of
tone
softer
in
character
than
the
scenes
he
preferred
he
stood
and
looked
idly
and
thinking
i
were
wise
i
should
go
to
paris
this
morning
what
was
the
use
of
letting
all
his
years
languish
and
drift
aimlessly
away
for
sake
of
a
woman
who
made
sport
of
his
pain
yonder
hidden
by
the
curve
of
a
distant
cliff
was
la
jacquemerille
and
its
mistress
of
the
moment
was
no
doubt
sleeping
soundly
enough
amongst
the
lace
and
cambric
and
satin
of
her
bed
and
would
not
have
lain
awake
one
moment
thinking
of
him
though
he
had
thought
of
her
all
night
people
ever
sleepless
for
love
she
had
said
once
with
her
pretty
cynical
smile
must
have
been
very
long
ago
before
the
chemists
had
given
us
chloral
as
he
stood
and
thus
made
his
picture
of
her
in
his
mind
sleeping
as
the
narcissus
which
she
resembled
sleeps
in
the
moonlight
he
saw
a
figure
underneath
the
ilex
boughs
which
was
not
hers
but
had
a
grace
of
its
own
though
wholly
unlike
her
it
was
the
figure
of
a
girl
in
a
grey
close
dress
which
defined
the
outline
of
her
tall
slim
limbs
she
wore
a
fur
hat
and
had
some
fur
about
her
shoulders
the
sunbeams
of
the
early
day
touched
the
gold
in
her
hair
and
shone
in
her
hazel
eyes
she
was
gathering
now
one
datura
now
another
of
those
spared
by
the
december
mistral
and
coming
up
to
a
bed
of
camellias
paused
doubtfully
before
their
blossoms
she
came
there
like
one
accustomed
to
the
place
and
who
merely
did
what
she
had
often
done
before
her
grey
gown
her
sunny
hair
under
its
crown
of
sable
her
hands
filled
with
flowers
made
a
picture
underneath
the
palms
amidst
the
statues
against
the
ilex
darkness
he
recognised
the
child
whom
he
had
last
seen
in
her
white
gown
with
the
black
sash
a
few
hours
before
in
the
duchesse
for
the
moment
he
put
on
her
appearance
there
that
construction
which
a
man
subject
from
his
boyhood
to
the
advances
and
solicitations
of
the
other
sex
was
most
apt
to
conceive
of
such
an
unsought
visit
but
as
he
saw
how
unconcerned
natural
and
childlike
her
movements
were
as
she
paused
now
by
this
shrub
and
now
by
that
or
sat
down
on
a
bench
to
arrange
some
asters
in
her
basket
he
as
rapidly
discarded
his
suspicions
and
guessed
the
truth
that
she
had
been
ignorant
of
who
he
was
the
previous
evening
and
had
come
to
his
gardens
by
chance
or
by
custom
as
he
hesitated
whether
to
descend
and
make
her
welcome
or
to
retreat
unseen
into
the
house
and
tell
his
servants
to
say
nothing
she
looked
up
and
saw
him
she
dropped
her
flowers
on
the
grass
and
turned
to
run
away
like
any
startled
nymph
in
classic
verse
but
he
was
too
quick
for
her
he
had
descended
the
few
steps
from
his
terrace
and
had
approached
her
before
she
could
fly
from
him
not
be
so
unkind
to
me
he
said
with
deference
and
courtesy
for
he
divined
how
ashamed
she
was
to
have
been
found
there
is
little
in
these
gardens
after
being
swept
by
the
mistral
which
is
a
cruel
horticulturist
but
the
hothouses
i
hope
may
give
you
something
worthier
your
acceptance
beg
your
pardon
she
murmured
has
been
no
one
here
so
long
he
had
spoken
as
though
her
presence
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
but
neither
his
composed
acceptance
of
it
or
his
courteous
welcome
could
reconcile
her
to
the
position
she
occupied
she
coloured
painfully
and
her
breath
came
and
went
in
an
agitation
she
could
not
subdue
beg
your
pardon
she
stammered
again
did
not
know
last
night
i
did
not
hear
your
name
there
has
been
no
one
here
so
long
oh
what
can
you
think
of
me
her
eyes
were
filled
with
sudden
tears
her
colour
faded
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
she
was
only
a
child
and
had
been
reared
by
stern
formalities
and
by
chill
precepts
echoed
othmar
you
are
kind
enough
to
treat
me
as
a
neighbour
neighbours
are
not
always
friends
but
i
hope
we
shall
be
so
that
little
gate
has
no
use
in
it
unless
it
be
an
open
portal
for
friendship
to
pass
to
and
fro
i
walked
through
it
to
millo
last
night
but
his
good
nature
and
gentleness
could
not
avail
to
console
her
for
what
was
in
her
own
eyes
as
it
would
have
been
in
that
of
her
relatives
an
unpardonable
and
infamous
misdemeanour
now
that
she
recognised
in
the
speaker
the
same
person
whom
her
cousin
had
presented
to
her
the
previous
evening
she
longed
for
the
lawn
she
stood
on
to
open
and
cover
her
a
piteous
dismay
took
possession
of
her
would
he
ever
believe
that
she
had
not
known
him
as
the
owner
of
pharamond
would
he
ever
believe
that
pharamond
had
been
that
morning
as
far
as
her
knowledge
had
gone
still
unoccupied
as
it
had
been
for
ten
mortal
years
all
the
lessons
of
her
convent
life
made
her
act
appear
in
her
own
eyes
one
of
inexcusable
audacity
unspeakable
horror
to
have
come
into
the
gardens
of
a
stranger
when
he
was
himself
there
to
take
his
flowers
the
kindness
of
his
gaze
and
the
cordiality
of
his
welcome
could
do
nothing
to
console
her
she
was
barely
conscious
of
them
the
colour
in
her
face
mounted
to
the
loose
curls
escaping
from
her
little
fur
cap
she
laid
her
basket
down
and
joined
her
hands
in
an
unconscious
supplication
has
been
no
one
here
so
long
she
said
yet
again
with
pathetic
appeal
in
her
voice
thought
i
did
no
harm
duvelleroy
the
head
gardener
has
always
let
me
come
when
there
is
a
feast
day
indeed
i
have
never
taken
the
rare
flowers
only
those
which
he
did
not
want
it
is
the
parish
church
of
pharamond
too
i
did
not
know
i
did
wrong
pray
do
not
blame
the
gardeners
them
when
i
am
so
much
their
debtor
i
wish
you
would
believe
that
you
are
the
queen
of
all
the
gardens
here
why
even
still
you
are
hesitating
to
pluck
the
camellias
they
told
me
never
to
touch
them
i
only
looked
at
them
i
think
duvelleroy
sends
them
to
nice
to
sell
indeed
indeed
i
have
never
taken
but
what
he
told
me
i
might
have
what
seemed
so
very
terrible
to
her
was
that
she
must
appear
to
the
owner
of
pharamond
as
a
thief
of
his
flowers
a
vague
idea
flashed
across
her
mind
that
perhaps
she
might
pay
for
the
value
of
them
but
then
she
had
no
money
the
old
jewels
of
her
mother
were
to
be
hers
indeed
but
when
she
had
not
even
seen
them
since
her
grandmother
had
died
perhaps
they
were
to
be
sold
to
defray
the
cost
of
her
entrance
into
convent
life
she
did
not
know
the
great
trouble
of
her
spirit
was
reflected
in
her
face
which
was
full
of
conflicting
emotions
her
mouth
which
had
been
too
silent
the
night
before
trembled
a
little
the
tears
gleamed
under
her
long
lashes
othmar
thought
her
much
more
interesting
with
all
this
expression
breaking
up
from
under
the
mask
of
white
marble
which
the
convent
had
made
her
wear
in
her
bewilderment
she
became
altogether
a
child
and
the
stately
quiet
of
her
manner
fell
away
from
her
like
an
embroidered
robe
too
heavy
for
her
years
they
sell
my
camellias
the
rogues
he
said
with
a
smile
course
you
shall
go
away
if
you
will
but
not
there
must
be
something
better
worth
having
than
those
roses
he
called
a
man
who
was
sweeping
up
leaves
on
a
lawn
here
and
tell
your
chief
to
cut
his
finest
orchids
and
bring
them
in
a
basket
to
me
himself
any
other
rare
thing
he
may
have
in
the
houses
he
can
cut
also
mademoiselle
he
said
turning
to
the
girl
must
not
go
back
to
millo
with
such
a
poor
opinion
of
my
gardens
is
the
duchesse
well
you
remember
that
i
had
the
honour
to
be
presented
to
you
by
her
last
evening
are
count
othmar
call
me
so
he
replied
for
he
never
loved
that
title
which
seemed
to
him
so
contemptible
a
thing
given
as
it
had
been
in
the
beginning
of
the
century
by
the
first
emperor
am
happy
to
be
the
owner
of
pharamond
since
you
deign
to
visit
it
you
are
at
millo
every
winter
i
think
am
they
are
not
she
said
regaining
her
composure
a
little
did
not
hear
your
name
last
night
i
thought
you
were
some
gentleman
from
paris
live
oftenest
in
paris
he
replied
at
the
present
moment
i
come
from
central
asia
i
am
a
friend
of
monsignore
melville
as
i
told
you
and
i
hope
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
if
only
for
his
regard
for
you
you
would
be
welcome
at
s
pharamond
he
spoke
without
compliment
seeing
that
any
compliment
would
only
scare
her
more
help
my
parish
church
did
you
say
he
continued
is
very
disgraceful
of
me
never
to
have
known
it
we
will
get
melville
to
come
and
preach
there
does
the
curé
want
for
anything
is
there
nothing
i
could
do
wants
a
new
very
much
she
said
with
hesitation
a
new
he
shall
have
before
the
world
is
a
week
older
said
othmar
will
you
go
away
are
you
too
afraid
of
me
to
venture
into
the
house
would
you
not
have
some
cream
some
cakes
some
strawberries
what
do
young
graces
like
you
live
upon
command
anything
you
will
have
had
some
bread
and
milk
i
want
nothing
you
are
very
kind
you
think
me
so
you
must
not
treat
me
so
distantly
you
must
make
me
a
friend
of
yours
the
duchesse
herself
presented
me
last
night
you
seem
determined
to
forget
that
she
stood
inclined
to
go
away
unwilling
to
seem
ungrateful
yet
afraid
to
remain
a
charming
picture
of
confusion
and
indecision
mingled
with
a
gravity
and
a
grace
beyond
her
years
the
greuze
face
which
he
had
seen
in
the
boat
bore
the
full
force
of
the
morning
light
as
a
rose
bears
it
the
pure
tints
only
deepened
and
illumined
by
it
under
the
straight
simple
lines
of
the
grey
stuff
gown
the
budding
beauties
of
a
still
childish
form
could
be
divined
in
her
embarrassment
her
colour
still
came
and
went
her
large
eyes
of
a
golden
hazel
were
almost
black
from
the
shadow
of
their
lashes
so
far
as
a
man
whose
heart
and
senses
are
engrossed
by
one
woman
can
be
alive
to
the
loveliness
of
another
othmar
was
sensible
of
this
youthful
and
poetic
beauty
which
seemed
to
belong
to
the
first
fresh
hours
of
the
morning
and
to
be
born
of
it
as
the
rosebuds
were
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
she
said
anxiously
was
my
fault
at
millo
no
one
must
touch
a
single
flower
and
the
curé
likes
to
see
the
altar
pretty
and
so
one
day
oh
that
is
quite
a
long
time
ago
three
winters
ago
i
happened
to
see
the
gate
open
into
these
grounds
and
i
asked
henri
if
i
might
gather
what
he
did
not
care
to
sell
and
he
said
that
i
was
welcome
always
to
the
common
flowers
you
will
not
blame
him
if
you
please
for
it
was
altogether
my
fault
she
had
seldom
made
a
speech
so
long
in
her
life
and
she
paused
ashamed
of
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
the
quiet
of
the
morning
air
she
feared
also
that
she
was
doing
wrong
to
speak
at
all
to
this
stranger
all
owner
of
pharamond
though
he
might
be
that
i
am
inclined
to
blame
him
for
answered
othmar
for
having
laid
any
restrictions
upon
you
he
has
no
right
to
sell
even
a
sprig
of
mignonette
these
gardens
are
not
kept
for
profit
they
can
have
no
happier
use
than
to
contribute
to
your
pleasure
and
to
the
altars
of
the
church
pray
do
not
go
wait
a
moment
for
this
criminal
to
bring
us
the
orchids
but
she
only
grew
more
alarmed
at
her
own
intrusion
there
the
easy
kindly
gallantry
of
his
manner
scarcely
reassured
her
she
was
but
a
child
and
a
child
reared
in
formal
and
severe
codes
she
doubted
that
she
was
guilty
of
some
grave
offence
in
standing
under
a
beside
a
group
of
camellias
with
a
person
whom
she
had
scarcely
seen
before
she
had
neither
the
habits
of
the
world
nor
the
conventional
badinage
which
could
have
met
his
courtesy
on
its
own
ground
and
replied
to
it
in
a
few
careless
phrases
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
silence
was
golden
as
golden
as
the
gleams
in
her
changeful
hazel
eyes
as
the
sun
smote
on
them
you
would
allow
me
to
go
she
murmured
have
quite
enough
flowers
here
it
is
such
a
small
church
and
the
orchids
would
be
much
too
rare
the
orchids
were
made
of
rubies
and
pearls
what
happier
fate
could
they
ask
than
to
fall
from
your
hands
on
to
the
altars
of
the
madonna
said
othmar
as
he
broke
off
the
blossoms
of
his
camellias
with
no
sparing
hand
at
that
moment
the
alarmed
and
disturbed
at
the
message
which
he
had
received
from
his
master
came
in
sight
with
a
basket
hurriedly
filled
with
some
of
the
choicest
treasures
of
his
othmar
took
it
from
him
did
quite
right
he
said
in
a
low
tone
make
my
friends
welcome
to
the
gardens
in
my
absence
but
another
time
duvelleroy
make
them
welcome
to
the
best
do
not
reserve
it
for
the
markets
and
the
florist
shops
of
nice
the
man
guilty
and
taken
at
a
disadvantage
had
no
time
to
prepare
a
lie
he
grew
red
and
stammered
and
was
thankful
for
his
gesture
of
dismissal
as
othmar
turned
from
him
impatiently
and
offered
the
orchids
to
the
girl
are
angry
with
him
she
said
anxiety
conquering
her
timidity
so
i
am
grateful
to
him
said
othmar
i
shall
perhaps
be
angry
with
my
whose
duty
it
is
to
keep
these
rogues
if
he
had
given
you
his
best
flowers
i
would
have
pensioned
him
for
life
but
to
limit
you
to
taking
what
he
did
not
want
to
sell
was
to
disgrace
s
pharamond
he
has
been
very
kind
all
these
three
winters
she
murmured
in
infinite
distress
at
the
thought
that
she
had
inadvertently
injured
the
man
in
his
master
opinion
shall
wear
the
order
of
fiacre
if
you
like
if
there
be
such
an
order
to
reward
good
gardeners
said
othmar
gaily
seeing
her
genuine
anxiety
on
the
man
behalf
may
come
and
see
your
decorations
shall
i
send
you
a
load
of
flowers
that
would
be
better
i
think
she
looked
alarmed
no
oh
pray
do
not
she
said
with
earnestness
are
very
kind
to
think
of
it
monsieur
but
it
would
frighten
the
curé
and
we
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
so
many
the
church
is
so
very
small
she
hesitated
a
moment
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
grew
warm
as
she
added
cousin
does
not
know
that
i
come
here
i
do
not
mean
that
it
is
any
secret
but
she
might
think
it
wrong
intrusive
impertinent
could
think
nothing
of
the
sort
said
othmar
are
three
words
which
no
one
could
associate
with
mdlle
de
valogne
i
am
delighted
my
deserted
house
could
be
so
honoured
must
you
go
i
shall
not
easily
forgive
myself
if
i
frighten
you
away
let
me
come
with
you
to
the
gate
at
least
he
walked
beside
her
under
the
palms
and
on
the
shaven
grass
down
an
aisle
of
clipped
arbutus
carrying
for
her
the
camellias
white
and
rose
which
he
had
broken
off
their
plants
with
no
care
for
the
appearance
of
the
group
to
which
they
belonged
she
was
silent
she
was
subdued
by
an
unwonted
sense
of
she
fancied
that
she
had
committed
some
terrible
indiscretion
but
how
was
she
to
have
known
that
he
was
there
when
for
three
winters
the
camellias
had
blossomed
unseen
in
those
silent
evergreen
ways
which
no
step
but
a
gardener
had
ever
disturbed
and
where
she
had
come
to
watch
the
blackbirds
trip
over
the
fallen
leaves
and
the
fountains
dance
in
the
sunshine
and
the
shower
petals
of
cream
and
of
gold
on
the
terraces
with
no
more
thought
or
hesitation
than
she
had
gone
to
the
of
nicole
sandros
her
confusion
had
nothing
of
awkwardness
it
was
very
graceful
almost
stately
in
its
silence
it
was
the
grave
innocence
the
startled
hesitation
of
the
young
nymph
surprised
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
grove
she
accepted
the
orchids
with
a
serious
gratitude
which
seemed
to
him
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
slenderness
of
the
gift
but
when
he
said
as
much
she
interrupted
him
are
so
beautiful
she
said
earnestly
seems
cruel
to
have
plucked
them
one
fancies
they
will
take
wing
like
the
butterflies
are
very
fond
of
flowers
yes
and
people
waste
them
so
at
my
cousin
ball
last
week
there
were
five
thousand
roses
i
saw
them
in
the
morning
they
were
quite
dead
you
not
see
them
at
night
night
no
how
could
i
i
am
not
in
the
world
i
never
shall
be
sometimes
they
tell
me
to
be
an
hour
in
the
after
dinner
that
is
all
i
do
not
care
for
it
do
you
not
wish
for
the
time
of
balls
to
come
every
young
girl
does
try
never
to
think
about
it
she
said
simply
know
it
will
never
come
for
me
there
was
a
resignation
in
her
words
which
was
more
pathetic
than
any
regrets
then
with
the
colour
hot
in
her
cheeks
again
remembering
that
she
was
speaking
too
much
to
a
stranger
she
opened
the
little
gate
in
the
arbutus
walk
which
led
into
the
grounds
of
millo
thank
you
very
much
she
murmured
assure
you
i
will
never
come
again
unless
you
come
again
i
assure
you
that
you
will
tell
me
tacitly
that
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
displease
you
said
othmar
as
he
held
open
the
gate
and
bowed
low
to
her
he
saw
that
it
would
be
only
unkindness
to
detain
her
or
to
accompany
her
she
was
as
uneasy
as
a
bird
which
has
flown
by
mistake
into
a
conservatory
will
come
to
the
church
he
added
you
not
sing
there
sometimes
and
then
there
is
no
one
else
to
sing
but
my
cousin
does
not
approve
of
it
she
thinks
there
may
be
people
over
from
nice
but
there
never
are
there
is
no
one
but
the
peasants
duchesse
will
not
mind
me
said
othmar
us
say
he
kissed
her
hand
with
a
careless
gallantry
which
made
her
colour
over
her
brow
and
throat
and
let
her
leave
him
she
sped
like
a
frightened
fawn
over
the
turf
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
in
the
bosquets
of
millo
othmar
strolled
back
to
the
house
tombeau
seul
finit
ma
voie
obscure
he
repeated
to
himself
as
he
looked
after
her
the
pathos
of
her
destiny
gave
her
a
spirituality
and
a
sanctity
in
his
sight
and
the
song
of
the
blind
child
and
its
young
singer
for
a
few
moments
disputed
a
place
in
his
memory
with
the
vision
of
nadine
napraxine
as
she
had
plucked
the
on
his
terrace
to
let
them
fall
young
girl
would
not
let
a
rose
fade
he
thought
her
own
roses
are
to
wither
between
convent
walls
what
arbitrary
caprices
has
fate
if
they
would
only
let
me
give
her
a
million
but
they
would
not
even
have
let
him
give
her
orchids
and
camellias
had
they
known
it
chapter
ix
othmar
went
into
his
house
but
before
taking
his
coffee
sent
for
his
steward
and
gave
him
a
brief
but
severe
reprimand
for
having
permitted
duvelleroy
and
his
underlings
to
use
the
gardens
as
a
grounds
may
be
sacked
to
please
my
friends
he
said
in
conclusion
if
a
single
carnation
be
sold
for
a
single
centime
it
is
not
the
seller
who
will
be
dismissed
but
yourself
who
are
paid
highly
only
that
you
may
save
your
subordinates
from
those
temptations
which
kill
honesty
and
should
be
no
more
left
in
the
path
of
poor
men
than
poisoned
mangolds
in
a
the
notion
that
his
hothouses
and
gardens
had
furnished
the
of
nice
with
materials
for
their
myriads
of
bouquets
irritated
him
disproportionately
he
would
have
taken
his
oath
that
on
none
of
his
estates
did
his
people
steal
a
farthing
worth
they
were
all
highly
paid
and
those
set
in
authority
over
them
were
all
men
who
had
been
chosen
and
enriched
by
his
father
he
had
often
spoken
of
their
probity
and
affection
with
pride
and
now
they
cheated
him
for
sake
of
selling
a
bouquet
it
was
a
mere
trifle
no
doubt
he
would
have
cleared
his
gardens
at
a
stroke
to
please
anyone
he
liked
and
he
would
have
given
a
poor
man
willingly
the
value
of
all
his
forcing
houses
but
the
knowledge
that
his
hirelings
sold
his
mignonette
and
his
heliotrope
to
profit
themselves
irritated
him
and
even
quite
embittered
life
to
him
for
the
moment
the
most
generous
minds
feel
the
most
acutely
betrayal
in
small
things
and
resent
most
vividly
the
contemptible
robberies
which
take
advantage
of
trust
and
opportunity
that
the
rich
man
is
so
seldom
honestly
served
goes
further
perhaps
to
redress
the
balance
between
him
and
the
poor
man
than
the
latter
in
his
ignorance
ever
supposes
all
he
thought
i
only
feed
rogues
like
napraxine
and
the
thought
was
painful
to
him
for
he
fed
them
well
it
was
primarily
his
own
fault
for
so
seldom
coming
to
the
place
perhaps
it
was
natural
that
when
years
rolled
on
and
they
never
saw
their
master
they
should
learn
to
consider
his
possessions
as
almost
their
own
but
he
had
so
many
places
that
he
could
not
live
in
them
all
his
fathers
had
bought
them
so
out
of
respect
to
their
memories
he
could
not
get
rid
of
them
he
had
a
great
house
on
the
boulevard
germain
another
great
house
in
piccadilly
another
in
the
teresian
platz
of
vienna
he
had
estates
in
france
england
germany
and
austria
a
scotch
moor
a
flemish
forest
a
château
on
the
shores
of
the
dalmatian
adriatic
a
villa
at
biarritz
a
castle
in
dense
woods
on
the
moselle
and
whole
towns
villages
plains
and
hills
in
croatia
itself
how
was
he
to
live
at
all
these
places
he
lent
them
liberally
but
he
could
hardly
sell
them
the
head
of
the
house
of
othmar
could
not
sell
what
he
had
inherited
if
he
had
sold
them
he
would
only
have
had
more
millions
with
which
he
would
not
have
known
what
to
do
when
he
had
drunk
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
glass
of
iced
water
he
went
for
a
long
ride
mounting
high
up
into
the
hills
until
the
sea
lay
far
below
blue
as
a
great
bed
of
mysotis
and
the
gilded
cupolas
of
la
jacquemerille
glittered
in
his
sight
far
beneath
the
darkening
slopes
of
pine
when
he
returned
to
his
one
breakfast
he
found
that
his
house
was
deserted
no
more
he
was
told
that
his
uncle
the
baron
friederich
had
arrived
by
the
from
paris
he
was
not
greatly
pleased
but
he
prepared
to
do
his
duties
as
a
host
without
betraying
his
sense
that
the
new
comer
was
not
precisely
in
harmony
with
a
romantic
retreat
amidst
myrtles
camellias
and
bromelias
but
he
also
foresaw
a
tedious
day
and
evening
and
he
did
not
care
to
have
the
keen
blue
eyes
of
his
father
brother
fixed
on
him
at
a
moment
when
he
was
sending
telegrams
in
all
directions
and
commanding
all
kinds
of
novel
diversions
to
amuse
and
receive
the
princess
napraxine
your
travels
tended
to
convince
you
that
europeans
are
wrong
not
to
let
the
tails
of
sheep
fatten
and
appear
at
their
tables
said
his
unbidden
guest
coming
out
of
the
house
as
though
they
had
parted
the
previous
night
instead
of
twenty
months
before
there
was
no
figure
better
known
in
paris
than
that
of
the
baron
friederich
othmar
familiar
to
society
all
over
europe
as
baron
fritz
a
tall
and
portly
figure
carried
with
the
ease
and
vigour
of
manhood
though
age
had
whitened
the
hair
that
was
still
abundant
on
the
handsome
head
above
he
never
attempted
to
conceal
his
age
he
despised
all
as
all
healthy
and
all
clever
men
do
and
if
his
skin
was
as
fair
and
his
hands
were
as
white
and
soft
as
a
duchess
it
was
because
nature
had
made
them
so
and
a
life
temperate
in
indulgence
though
entirely
unscrupulous
in
morals
had
preserved
his
health
and
his
strength
unimpaired
save
by
occasional
twinges
of
the
gout
with
old
gaulois
blood
in
him
friederich
othmar
was
a
thorough
parisian
in
habit
taste
and
manner
but
he
was
a
true
slav
in
suppleness
sagacity
and
profound
secretiveness
othmar
thought
that
there
was
not
on
the
face
of
the
earth
another
man
with
such
a
hideous
power
of
dissimulation
as
his
uncle
whilst
the
elder
man
on
the
contrary
looked
upon
such
dissimulation
as
the
mere
mark
which
distinguishes
the
civilised
being
from
the
savage
lies
at
the
root
of
all
good
manners
he
was
wont
to
say
in
moments
of
frankness
friend
bores
you
infinitely
you
smile
and
appear
charmed
if
you
do
not
you
are
a
boor
dissimulation
is
the
essence
of
christianity
you
are
enjoined
to
turn
one
cheek
after
another
and
not
to
show
that
you
smart
dissimulation
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
society
possible
without
its
amenities
the
world
would
be
a
on
the
bourse
fritz
was
dreaded
as
the
colossus
of
finance
in
all
europe
his
acumen
was
unerring
his
mind
was
as
sensitive
to
the
changes
of
the
political
atmosphere
as
an
electric
wire
to
heat
he
perceived
long
before
anyone
else
the
little
cloud
not
so
big
as
a
man
hand
which
was
pregnant
with
storm
whilst
yet
the
sky
was
clear
he
heard
long
before
anyone
else
the
low
tremor
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
which
prefaced
the
seismic
convulsion
as
yet
undreamed
of
by
a
sleeping
world
therefore
with
supreme
tact
and
matchless
instinct
he
had
made
the
house
of
othmar
the
envy
of
all
its
peers
are
statesmen
without
us
said
friederich
othmar
can
not
move
they
can
not
strike
unless
the
financiers
enable
them
to
do
so
all
their
combinations
crumble
like
a
dropt
unless
we
are
willing
to
sustain
them
if
germany
had
had
no
money
could
she
have
crossed
the
rhine
the
finest
army
in
the
world
is
no
more
than
a
child
set
of
metal
soldiers
if
it
be
not
sur
the
statesmen
are
thought
to
be
the
chief
rulers
and
prime
motors
of
the
fate
of
the
world
but
they
can
but
act
as
we
who
are
behind
them
permit
they
drag
the
coach
we
drive
it
i
know
answered
othmar
have
the
most
gigantic
responsibility
united
with
the
most
utterly
corrupt
moral
code
i
grant
that
we
are
in
a
way
the
cæsars
of
the
modern
world
but
we
are
bestially
selfish
we
are
in
our
repletion
as
all
cæsars
become
no
financier
ever
risked
ruin
for
a
noble
impulse
or
for
a
lost
cause
if
he
did
he
would
seem
mad
to
his
guild
as
ulysses
to
his
companions
all
the
enjoyment
and
sense
of
power
which
othmar
contemptuously
rejected
his
uncle
appreciated
to
the
full
he
was
in
his
own
way
a
wolsey
a
richelieu
a
bismarck
nothing
of
much
importance
had
been
done
in
europe
for
the
last
forty
years
without
friederich
othmar
being
beneath
it
in
more
or
less
degree
for
weal
or
woe
he
had
those
unerring
instincts
which
amount
in
their
own
way
to
genius
endowed
with
one
of
those
keen
logical
yet
imaginative
brains
which
are
as
necessary
to
the
great
financier
as
to
the
great
statesman
he
had
worked
unweariedly
all
his
life
long
for
the
sake
and
for
the
glory
of
the
house
of
othmar
he
was
in
no
way
of
his
opinion
he
considered
that
the
world
held
nothing
finer
than
the
fortunes
which
had
been
built
up
out
of
marc
othmar
kreutzers
till
it
was
solid
as
so
many
towers
of
bullion
he
considered
the
position
of
the
capitalist
who
can
refuse
a
king
sustain
a
nation
fructify
great
enterprises
and
constrain
or
restrain
great
wars
was
not
to
be
exchanged
with
any
other
power
under
the
sun
in
finance
he
was
inexorable
unerring
full
of
the
finest
penetration
and
the
most
piercing
acumen
stern
as
granite
piercing
as
steel
in
private
life
he
was
an
amiable
cynic
who
cared
for
very
little
except
the
reputation
of
his
dinners
and
his
collection
of
baron
fritz
was
never
really
content
out
of
his
little
hotel
which
was
as
cosy
as
a
bag
and
where
by
stretching
out
a
finger
to
touch
an
ivory
button
he
could
put
himself
in
communication
with
all
the
centres
of
finance
in
europe
without
moving
from
his
velvet
chair
or
taking
his
foot
from
its
he
could
converse
with
his
brother
capitalists
at
all
quarters
of
the
globe
and
change
the
fate
of
nations
and
the
surface
of
events
in
the
course
of
a
forenoon
during
a
pause
between
two
cigarettes
to
be
able
to
do
so
seemed
to
him
the
very
flower
and
perfection
of
life
it
was
to
play
chess
with
the
world
for
your
board
and
to
say
checkmate
to
living
and
crowned
kings
whenever
he
expatiated
on
that
theme
to
his
nephew
othmar
only
replied
that
he
himself
did
not
care
for
any
games
for
the
rest
his
one
great
social
amusement
was
whist
he
could
never
see
why
men
forsook
their
clubs
because
hay
was
being
mown
and
corn
reaped
and
grapes
gathered
you
bought
forage
you
ate
bread
very
little
of
it
and
you
drank
wine
but
why
because
those
three
things
were
all
in
their
embryo
state
every
city
in
europe
should
become
empty
he
had
not
patience
to
comprehend
no
place
was
cooler
shadier
quieter
than
your
club
the
vast
green
silent
country
which
his
nephew
loved
was
to
him
an
outer
darkness
he
detested
with
all
the
maliciousness
against
it
of
a
born
and
bred
parisian
to
see
a
breezy
common
on
a
square
of
david
cox
or
a
brook
purling
amongst
rushes
by
bonnington
was
to
have
as
much
of
the
country
as
he
cared
to
enjoy
the
stones
of
vienna
the
asphalte
of
paris
were
the
only
ground
he
cared
to
tread
he
had
educated
his
cook
into
perfect
excellence
and
never
travelled
anywhere
without
him
and
his
battery
of
silver
saucepans
you
sleep
in
a
strange
bed
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
let
yourself
be
poisoned
by
strange
dishes
he
invariably
said
on
the
whole
he
had
led
a
happy
and
enviable
life
he
was
a
perfectly
selfish
man
with
one
great
unselfish
loyalty
set
in
the
midst
of
his
egotism
like
a
vein
of
pure
marble
amongst
a
mass
of
sandstone
benefit
the
house
fritz
would
let
himself
be
brayed
in
a
mortar
his
brother
had
often
said
of
him
in
private
life
on
the
contrary
he
was
entirely
as
became
a
man
who
was
one
of
the
most
notable
persons
in
paris
he
had
never
been
known
to
lend
a
piece
but
he
gave
choice
dinners
three
times
a
week
which
cost
twenty
napoleons
for
each
guest
sometimes
he
thought
with
a
pang
of
terror
of
what
would
become
of
the
house
of
othmar
when
he
himself
should
be
no
more
he
was
seventy
years
old
he
would
be
unable
to
live
for
ever
his
arsenal
of
wires
contained
no
ivory
button
by
which
he
could
summon
eternal
life
he
had
gout
in
his
system
and
he
did
not
disguise
from
himself
that
any
day
his
cook
with
the
silver
saucepans
his
pretty
aquarelles
his
gigantic
operations
his
intense
love
of
life
might
one
and
all
be
powerless
to
keep
him
in
his
place
and
then
all
the
magnitude
and
might
of
the
house
of
othmar
would
depend
solely
and
entirely
on
one
capricious
and
unstable
young
man
who
only
cared
for
a
greek
poet
or
a
german
opera
on
these
melancholy
days
when
he
remembered
this
he
voluntarily
deprived
himself
of
his
burgundy
and
ate
only
of
two
dishes
he
was
much
attached
to
othmar
but
he
was
impatient
of
him
he
was
annoyed
by
what
he
looked
upon
as
his
crotchets
and
caprices
he
was
irritated
by
the
unconcealed
apathy
and
even
scorn
with
which
his
nephew
regarded
his
own
superb
position
in
the
world
the
dissatisfaction
with
which
the
origin
of
their
house
filled
the
head
of
it
was
to
baron
fritz
almost
incomprehensible
and
whimsical
squeamishness
if
he
revered
anything
in
life
it
was
the
tradition
of
old
marc
othmar
amassing
his
florins
in
the
city
of
agram
aught
we
know
he
was
a
tchigan
a
romany
his
nephew
had
said
to
him
once
and
he
had
replied
angrily
if
he
were
a
gipsy
is
there
blood
more
ancient
is
there
a
people
freer
is
there
an
intelligence
more
complex
what
are
the
european
races
beside
the
oriental
but
you
know
very
well
that
he
was
a
pure
croat
he
had
concluded
with
intolerable
impatience
of
such
depreciation
of
the
founder
of
their
greatness
although
it
had
been
the
habit
of
his
life
to
follow
and
study
the
minds
of
men
even
in
their
more
secret
thoughts
he
had
no
patience
to
attempt
to
understand
the
caprices
of
his
nephew
it
was
he
thought
that
kind
of
ingratitude
to
fate
which
is
almost
an
insanity
the
same
sort
of
fractious
wilfulness
which
made
james
of
scotland
love
to
wander
disguised
in
his
own
towns
and
sent
domitian
to
a
plot
of
cabbages
to
baron
fritz
the
power
and
might
of
the
house
he
belonged
to
had
ever
been
in
the
stead
of
any
other
religion
creed
or
attachment
he
was
not
personally
an
ambitious
or
an
avaricious
man
he
had
effaced
himself
for
his
brother
sake
as
he
still
slaved
for
his
son
the
celebrity
of
the
house
of
othmar
their
power
heavy
as
an
elephant
tread
subtle
as
an
electric
current
the
magnitude
of
the
operations
which
they
either
undertook
or
impeded
the
respect
with
which
europe
regarded
them
the
weight
of
their
own
smile
or
frown
all
these
things
were
the
very
breath
of
his
life
to
him
he
had
remained
and
always
willingly
remained
a
subordinate
he
had
never
resented
the
superiority
of
his
elder
brother
in
power
and
position
all
he
had
cared
to
do
was
to
give
his
years
to
the
service
and
aggrandisement
of
his
race
he
would
have
been
very
astonished
if
he
had
been
told
that
it
was
in
its
way
after
all
chiefly
a
form
of
sentiment
which
actuated
him
between
himself
and
othmar
there
was
the
affection
of
consanguinity
but
no
sympathy
whatever
to
the
elder
man
the
younger
seemed
almost
blasphemously
unworthy
of
his
heritage
the
generosities
and
the
scruples
of
such
a
seemed
to
him
the
perverseness
of
a
child
usually
othmar
willingly
abandoned
to
him
the
guidance
of
their
great
argosy
freighted
with
the
gold
of
the
world
but
twice
or
thrice
since
his
majority
he
had
interfered
when
he
had
considered
a
loan
immoral
or
an
enterprise
corrupt
and
had
made
his
veto
as
head
of
the
house
obeyed
forcibly
those
few
times
had
been
unpardonable
to
the
baron
who
had
not
his
eccentric
and
quixotic
principles
are
affairs
he
said
you
conduct
them
according
to
the
follies
and
phantasies
of
the
story
of
arthur
adieu
would
willingly
say
adieu
an
eternal
adieu
had
retorted
othmar
you
have
told
me
repeatedly
that
i
can
not
withdraw
my
house
from
business
without
causing
ruin
on
the
bourses
of
europe
and
dishonouring
our
name
by
annulling
and
repudiating
our
engagements
course
you
can
not
had
said
the
baron
to
whom
the
mere
idea
seemed
like
a
preparation
to
blow
up
with
dynamite
all
the
mountains
of
europe
and
of
asia
you
suppose
you
can
efface
such
an
institution
as
our
financial
existence
you
might
as
well
say
that
a
sovereign
by
dying
could
will
his
country
into
as
i
can
not
touch
the
engagements
of
the
past
however
much
i
condemn
them
i
will
at
least
keep
pure
the
obligations
of
the
future
othmar
had
answered
and
those
transactions
which
his
more
delicate
sense
of
honour
did
not
allow
him
to
approve
he
refused
to
permit
to
be
undertaken
baron
fritz
who
had
the
ordinary
financier
conscience
that
is
who
would
have
done
nothing
commercially
dishonourable
but
who
cared
not
a
straw
how
iniquitous
might
be
the
results
of
an
operation
so
long
as
it
was
legal
clever
and
lucrative
was
beyond
measure
irritated
by
this
occasional
interference
of
one
who
was
too
fine
a
gentleman
too
indolent
a
dreamer
to
bear
any
of
the
frets
and
burden
of
habitual
attention
to
their
gigantic
operations
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
otho
othmar
was
the
head
of
the
house
and
what
was
a
greater
grief
still
to
his
uncle
the
only
living
one
of
the
name
besides
himself
they
who
could
have
given
fortunes
and
position
to
a
score
of
younger
branches
who
could
have
had
their
sons
and
brothers
objects
of
power
and
worship
in
all
the
capitals
of
europe
had
been
so
visited
by
death
and
destiny
that
of
them
all
there
only
remained
the
young
man
who
was
othmar
to
all
the
world
and
the
old
one
who
was
baron
fritz
to
his
intimate
associates
and
baron
friederich
to
all
the
bourses
should
marry
otho
said
the
baron
to
him
now
have
no
inclination
to
do
so
he
answered
and
thought
of
nadine
napraxine
exclaimed
the
other
irritably
has
inclination
to
do
with
it
is
inclination
considered
or
waited
for
in
the
marriages
of
princes
you
are
a
prince
in
your
own
way
if
you
died
your
race
would
be
extinct
would
not
much
matter
said
othmar
have
never
been
conspicuous
for
anything
except
for
amassing
gold
as
a
ship
keel
collects
barnacles
i
suppose
i
had
better
make
a
will
you
shall
have
everything
for
your
lifetime
and
then
it
shall
all
go
to
the
french
republic
which
is
the
only
national
institution
i
know
of
that
is
capable
of
muddling
away
two
hundred
milliards
in
a
year
with
nothing
whatever
to
show
for
it
afterwards
baron
fritz
made
a
gesture
of
irritated
contempt
ought
to
have
had
legitimate
heirs
ten
years
ago
you
do
not
belong
to
yourself
you
have
no
right
to
live
and
die
without
raising
up
posterity
do
not
see
the
obligation
said
othmar
i
do
not
care
enough
about
the
name
which
you
think
so
very
fine
to
greatly
grieve
over
its
probable
extinction
baron
fritz
had
heard
this
often
but
he
never
heard
it
freshly
without
an
inward
shudder
such
as
a
religious
man
feels
before
a
blasphemy
othmar
merely
as
a
man
seemed
to
him
a
fanciful
dreamer
an
unsatisfactory
anomaly
an
unphilosophic
thinker
whose
theories
were
always
playing
the
deuce
with
his
interest
and
whose
sympathies
ran
away
with
him
like
horses
but
othmar
as
the
chief
of
his
house
could
do
no
wrong
and
had
to
be
obeyed
even
if
he
rushed
on
his
own
destruction
should
marry
for
sake
of
posterity
he
reiterated
are
so
happily
and
exceptionally
situated
that
you
can
choose
wherever
you
please
no
living
woman
would
refuse
you
you
should
seek
physical
charms
for
sake
of
your
offspring
and
high
lineage
also
the
rest
is
a
mere
matter
of
taste
rest
is
only
a
trifle
only
character
mind
and
feeling
the
three
things
which
determine
happiness
and
influence
life
more
than
anything
else
baron
fritz
made
a
little
gesture
of
indifference
imagine
anyone
would
not
err
in
any
of
these
points
happiness
one
usually
finds
with
the
wives
of
others
not
that
i
would
discourage
you
if
you
be
inclined
am
not
inclined
said
othmar
brusquely
only
say
that
character
is
never
considered
by
men
and
women
when
they
marry
yet
it
is
what
makes
or
mars
a
life
when
a
marriage
is
announced
what
is
discussed
the
respective
fortunes
of
those
concerned
then
their
good
looks
or
their
lack
of
them
perhaps
someone
adds
that
he
is
or
someone
says
taille
est
or
on
the
other
hand
they
may
say
he
is
a
fool
or
she
has
ugly
feet
but
you
never
hear
a
word
as
to
their
characters
their
sympathies
or
their
principles
it
is
why
all
marriages
are
at
best
but
a
compromise
between
two
dispositions
yours
said
baron
fritz
you
attach
so
much
to
character
let
character
be
your
study
myself
i
have
always
considered
that
marriage
is
a
means
of
continuing
a
race
so
that
it
legally
can
continue
to
transmit
property
i
have
never
known
why
people
imported
fine
sentiments
into
a
legal
transaction
it
is
taking
a
false
view
of
a
social
duty
to
look
for
personal
pleasure
out
of
it
indeed
if
a
man
be
in
love
with
his
wife
he
will
probably
communicate
his
passion
to
her
which
is
undesirable
because
it
awakens
her
senses
and
ultimately
leads
to
her
taking
a
lover
or
lovers
which
again
introduces
uncertainty
into
the
legal
enjoyment
and
transmission
of
property
othmar
smiled
baron
you
are
the
most
profoundly
immoral
man
i
ever
met
you
would
always
too
subordinate
humanity
to
property
all
human
actions
should
according
to
you
only
tend
to
the
consolidation
and
concentration
of
fortune
now
there
is
no
possible
theory
of
human
action
more
demoralising
is
a
matter
of
opinion
said
the
baron
unless
your
forefathers
had
carried
that
theory
into
practice
you
would
now
be
taming
wild
horses
in
croatia
or
probably
you
otho
othmar
in
your
entity
as
you
are
would
not
exist
at
all
for
certainly
your
father
would
not
have
wedded
with
an
english
aristocrat
is
a
humiliating
reflection
said
othmar
one
existence
depended
on
the
accidental
union
of
two
persons
indeed
i
decline
to
believe
it
i
am
convinced
that
the
real
the
impersonal
entity
which
has
been
called
the
soul
for
want
of
knowing
what
to
call
it
must
have
had
its
own
independent
existence
the
envelope
it
is
slipped
into
is
the
accident
let
us
think
so
at
all
events
it
is
more
consoling
than
your
notion
that
the
entire
life
of
depended
on
the
chance
of
cohabiting
with
and
that
if
had
wedded
instead
would
never
have
existed
at
all
but
another
and
totally
different
being
would
have
done
so
say
z
the
baron
shrugged
his
shoulders
why
he
wondered
why
on
earth
should
a
man
care
about
a
or
a
spiritual
existence
at
all
who
had
everything
that
his
heart
could
desire
in
his
terrestrial
life
he
could
imagine
that
starving
poets
or
hungry
theologians
comforted
themselves
with
those
fancies
but
othmar
should
have
been
a
montalembert
or
a
lamennais
he
answered
which
was
a
polite
way
of
saying
that
he
was
an
imbecile
being
either
the
one
or
the
other
one
may
carry
into
public
life
the
same
sort
of
honour
which
even
you
think
incumbent
on
one
in
public
life
said
othmar
at
all
said
his
relative
code
for
one
has
never
been
the
code
for
the
other
a
man
in
private
life
may
not
send
another
man
to
be
slain
because
it
suits
his
purpose
a
man
in
public
life
that
is
as
a
war
minister
or
as
an
officer
may
send
ten
thousand
fifty
thousand
men
to
certain
slaughter
so
has
a
diplomatist
every
title
to
lie
as
much
as
he
may
need
to
do
in
the
public
service
but
he
has
no
right
to
deceive
his
personal
friend
in
a
private
matter
this
is
not
mere
casuistry
it
is
indeed
all
effective
casuistry
is
based
on
most
dangerous
casuistry
is
so
no
doubt
said
othmar
when
it
is
so
based
it
is
irresistible
in
its
appeal
to
egotism
do
not
know
why
you
use
the
word
dangerous
replied
the
baron
is
so
wholesome
as
to
teach
men
to
take
care
of
their
own
interests
if
that
lesson
were
universally
understood
there
would
be
neither
paupers
or
criminals
should
have
a
world
of
bankers
said
othmar
all
deference
to
you
even
that
would
not
be
a
millennium
the
baron
assented
with
good
humour
that
it
would
certainly
not
be
one
since
there
would
be
no
investments
of
any
kind
possible
the
day
was
tedious
to
othmar
he
had
to
examine
many
projects
and
append
his
signature
to
many
documents
he
had
not
disappeared
into
central
asia
for
eighteen
months
without
having
brought
upon
himself
the
penalty
of
many
arrears
of
affairs
his
assent
was
merely
but
the
formula
was
necessary
is
in
love
still
with
madame
napraxine
thought
his
uncle
finding
his
attention
hard
to
fix
he
was
not
sorry
for
that
at
othmar
age
he
was
sure
to
be
in
love
with
someone
and
the
more
he
was
in
love
the
less
likely
was
he
to
meddle
with
the
transactions
of
the
house
the
baron
could
be
excessively
amusing
and
was
so
this
day
of
his
arrival
at
pharamond
but
othmar
would
gladly
have
been
free
of
his
presence
he
knew
that
the
old
man
would
see
at
a
glance
if
he
and
nadine
napraxine
met
before
him
that
time
had
not
cured
him
of
passion
and
the
malice
and
the
contempt
of
his
uncle
were
both
disagreeable
to
him
moreover
othmar
had
been
too
perpetually
agreed
with
all
his
life
to
be
pleased
by
the
constant
enunciation
of
opinions
and
sentiments
the
reverse
of
his
own
there
was
that
in
the
tranquil
cynicism
of
baron
friederich
which
left
him
with
a
sense
of
moral
nausea
men
it
is
true
were
not
worth
much
but
he
could
never
get
accustomed
to
the
calm
manner
in
which
his
uncle
was
habitually
ready
to
sacrifice
all
their
interests
their
bodies
too
had
there
been
any
question
of
them
to
what
he
considered
advantageous
to
himself
and
to
his
house
in
public
life
and
finance
he
did
not
care
for
the
new
russian
loan
for
the
new
turkish
loan
for
the
great
naval
dockyards
to
be
made
by
germany
on
the
baltic
for
the
railway
that
was
to
be
driven
along
the
ancient
bed
of
the
oxus
nor
for
the
necessities
of
the
empire
of
brazil
nor
for
the
development
of
canadian
forests
it
did
not
interest
him
that
such
and
such
a
sovereign
would
be
a
cripple
without
his
help
or
such
and
such
a
country
as
virtually
in
pawn
to
him
as
though
it
had
been
a
pledged
estate
that
the
assistance
of
his
gold
could
enable
a
ministry
to
keep
its
tenure
of
office
or
the
refusal
of
it
could
precipitate
a
state
into
revolution
to
baron
fritz
it
was
like
holding
the
reins
of
the
universe
but
to
othmar
himself
it
was
excessively
dull
work
the
heir
of
four
generations
of
he
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
immense
power
which
lay
in
the
stroke
of
his
pen
the
genius
of
finance
was
inherited
by
him
though
dormant
in
him
even
his
uncle
did
justice
to
the
accuracy
of
his
vision
to
the
certainty
of
his
instinct
but
it
was
genius
unused
he
had
no
taste
to
employ
its
capacities
europe
was
as
indifferent
to
him
as
a
mound
of
clay
only
do
mischief
unmitigated
mischief
he
asserted
very
often
at
the
canal
of
suez
it
has
only
bred
wars
and
pretexts
for
wars
and
will
probably
embroil
england
and
france
for
the
next
century
until
indeed
india
shall
have
become
russian
or
the
african
negro
have
avenged
then
again
take
the
panama
project
it
will
set
great
britain
and
the
united
states
at
each
throats
like
two
are
enough
to
make
your
father
rise
from
his
grave
said
baron
fritz
is
only
aristocrats
who
do
that
returned
othmar
financier
sleeps
sound
on
the
remembrance
of
his
own
virtues
and
loans
the
memory
of
his
father
was
bitter
to
him
he
could
not
forget
the
injury
done
to
him
in
his
earliest
youth
by
subjecting
him
to
the
charms
and
the
corruptions
of
sara
vernon
must
marry
and
then
you
will
see
things
differently
his
uncle
insisted
reverting
to
the
simplicity
of
reiteration
what
a
cruel
thing
was
destiny
thousands
of
men
who
had
not
a
crust
of
bread
begat
legitimate
offsprings
in
the
most
reckless
and
profuse
manner
and
the
one
man
for
whom
lawful
heirs
were
an
absolute
necessity
and
duty
obstinately
neglected
his
obligations
to
family
and
to
the
world
it
was
possible
even
probable
that
the
last
of
the
othmars
would
remain
the
last
of
his
race
for
me
said
othmar
will
give
all
we
possess
to
any
cousins
you
may
give
me
and
keep
only
enough
myself
to
live
peaceably
in
arabia
felix
i
have
always
wished
to
live
there
the
climate
is
divine
and
after
all
there
is
nothing
that
is
of
so
much
consequence
as
climate
will
always
jest
people
say
i
am
too
serious
i
am
not
jesting
at
all
we
have
all
a
sort
of
superstition
that
we
must
live
in
europe
but
it
is
only
a
superstition
there
is
a
great
deal
finer
weather
elsewhere
and
without
fine
weather
life
is
intolerable
you
never
seen
a
woman
you
would
marry
asked
baron
fritz
i
have
said
othmar
who
never
lied
never
one
i
could
marry
someone
else
wife
that
is
just
like
you
if
she
were
not
unattainable
she
would
have
no
more
attraction
than
anyone
else
you
are
so
whimsical
hope
not
i
dislike
whimsical
people
they
are
always
asking
for
the
windows
to
be
shut
or
imagining
that
there
is
a
drainpipe
open
oh
some
day
i
may
marry
i
do
not
pledge
my
future
but
i
have
no
inclination
to
marriage
and
you
will
confess
that
you
preach
what
you
do
not
practise
am
and
you
are
said
baron
fritz
should
have
married
fifty
years
ago
if
i
had
been
as
you
are
the
head
of
the
house
the
house
said
othmar
though
he
was
a
man
who
never
used
any
oaths
great
or
small
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
house
of
othmar
was
for
ever
on
his
shoulders
like
sindbad
burden
that
he
could
do
nothing
freely
as
other
men
did
that
go
where
he
would
he
could
never
wholly
escape
from
the
mephitic
acid
which
adulation
and
importunity
exhale
and
could
never
gain
that
simplicity
of
existence
which
precisely
because
it
was
denied
to
him
seemed
to
him
the
chief
good
on
earth
speak
as
if
the
othmars
had
been
plantagenets
or
comneni
he
continued
is
not
quite
two
centuries
ago
that
the
world
did
not
even
know
that
a
croat
bore
that
name
the
last
time
i
was
at
agram
i
looked
into
the
archives
of
the
city
nobody
ever
did
so
they
were
crabbed
and
hard
to
decipher
but
i
passed
a
day
over
them
when
it
was
raining
and
blowing
so
hard
that
there
was
not
a
soul
abroad
in
the
streets
except
the
sentries
in
the
municipal
documents
for
the
year
i
found
an
account
of
a
famine
which
had
been
the
result
of
floods
such
as
we
have
seen
in
our
own
day
for
science
after
all
makes
little
way
against
natural
catastrophes
it
was
during
this
famine
when
every
grain
of
wheat
was
worth
treble
its
weight
in
gold
that
your
hero
marc
othmar
made
his
first
great
he
had
amassed
money
before
but
this
was
the
grand
conception
which
first
largely
enriched
him
he
had
bought
enormously
in
corn
foreseeing
a
wet
season
and
bad
harvests
he
had
more
than
he
had
hoped
for
he
had
the
whole
country
under
water
he
had
almost
a
monopoly
of
grain
in
those
days
government
aid
could
not
come
by
steam
and
besides
croatia
had
just
then
no
government
in
these
records
it
is
stated
that
upwards
of
thousand
persons
chiefly
women
and
children
died
of
starvation
and
all
the
while
they
were
dying
marc
othmar
shut
up
his
grain
and
only
sold
it
sack
by
sack
at
an
average
rate
of
a
death
a
bushel
you
find
that
admirable
i
do
not
i
confess
ever
since
i
put
these
facts
together
out
of
the
fragments
of
public
history
it
has
seemed
to
me
as
if
there
were
an
earthy
smell
about
all
our
money
you
know
the
lungs
of
people
who
die
starved
always
do
smell
like
decaying
mould
it
is
pure
fancy
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
but
even
putting
fancy
out
of
the
question
i
do
not
see
anything
heroic
about
the
figure
of
our
founder
he
is
not
hugh
lupus
or
godfrey
de
bouillon
baron
fritz
patience
had
scarcely
endured
the
strain
upon
it
never
heard
the
story
i
believe
you
have
invented
it
he
said
irritably
it
be
true
we
have
no
explanation
so
we
can
not
form
a
correct
judgment
at
the
most
accepting
it
as
you
relate
it
no
more
was
done
then
by
marc
othmar
than
every
farmer
or
peasant
proprietor
in
europe
and
america
does
whenever
he
gets
a
chance
not
so
much
as
was
done
by
ferdinand
de
lesseps
when
he
sacrificed
the
fellahs
to
make
his
egyptian
canal
you
can
not
conduct
any
trade
on
abstract
principles
or
æsthetic
moralities
you
must
buy
cheap
and
sell
dear
or
commerce
falls
to
the
ground
and
the
whole
superstructure
of
society
falls
with
it
as
the
lawyer
can
not
refuse
to
conduct
a
case
because
he
disapproves
of
the
morality
of
it
so
a
financier
can
not
let
pass
a
favourable
operation
because
he
may
not
approve
entirely
of
its
scope
all
he
has
to
examine
are
its
wisdom
and
utility
when
once
you
enter
the
region
of
motives
and
of
principles
all
is
confusion
no
two
men
have
the
same
views
as
to
what
is
right
you
must
proceed
on
broader
lines
than
those
of
fanciful
ethics
for
instance
nothing
is
more
clearly
immoral
than
the
marriage
of
two
diseased
persons
but
the
priest
or
the
mayor
who
should
refuse
to
perform
the
ceremonies
demanded
of
him
because
he
conceived
that
the
bodily
health
of
the
people
came
before
him
was
unsatisfactory
would
be
clearly
overpassing
the
boundaries
of
his
functions
which
are
limited
to
the
consideration
of
simply
legal
obstacles
so
a
man
of
business
who
once
concerns
himself
with
the
vague
moralities
of
his
speculations
is
lost
all
he
has
to
occupy
himself
with
is
their
solvency
their
legality
and
their
probabilities
of
success
or
failure
marc
othmar
no
doubt
regarded
his
investments
in
corn
in
that
purely
practical
light
a
very
clever
man
as
you
are
returned
othmar
are
curiously
unconscious
of
what
a
satire
your
theories
are
on
all
that
you
most
admire
i
am
as
entirely
convinced
as
you
can
be
that
marc
othmar
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
thousand
people
who
starved
to
death
while
his
corn
was
shut
up
in
granaries
and
barges
all
the
difference
between
us
is
that
you
think
this
singleness
of
eye
for
his
own
interest
was
heroic
and
i
think
it
was
not
so
that
it
was
even
as
near
true
hellish
wickedness
as
humanity
can
go
is
neither
wickedness
nor
virtue
in
questions
of
finance
said
baron
friederich
with
distress
at
his
nephew
obtuseness
is
certainly
no
virtue
said
othmar
wickedness
nor
virtue
repeated
the
baron
are
pure
abstractions
like
political
economy
to
talk
of
the
immorality
of
a
speculation
is
like
talking
of
the
vices
of
a
there
is
only
one
sin
in
a
financial
operation
it
sins
if
it
be
unsound
morality
then
said
othmar
at
least
this
advantage
over
social
morality
that
it
is
very
much
simplified
is
simple
as
your
stable
doctrines
replied
the
baron
a
horse
be
sound
he
is
a
good
horse
if
he
be
not
sound
he
is
a
screw
nothing
can
be
simpler
and
the
moment
that
a
man
begins
to
confuse
himself
with
asking
any
more
complex
questions
than
this
one
is
it
sound
whether
he
engage
in
a
great
operation
of
finance
or
whether
he
be
only
buying
a
roadster
he
will
be
inevitably
bewildered
with
his
own
multiform
requirements
and
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
mere
persuasive
sharpers
can
buy
a
horse
said
othmar
i
will
leave
finance
to
you
always
said
baron
fritz
grimly
with
vivid
recollections
of
more
than
one
occasion
on
which
his
nephew
had
interfered
with
a
peremptory
veto
to
prevent
some
contemplated
operation
of
which
the
morality
was
more
doubtful
than
the
expediency
the
occasions
had
been
rare
indeed
but
they
had
left
an
ineffaceable
soreness
on
the
mind
of
the
elder
man
nay
he
would
scarcely
have
forgiven
them
had
it
not
been
that
his
devotion
to
otho
as
to
the
head
of
the
house
had
something
of
the
irrational
and
patient
loyalty
which
the
russian
nation
renders
blindly
to
its
unseen
tzar
as
for
othmar
himself
he
was
too
impatient
of
his
uncle
laxity
of
principle
and
conscience
to
do
full
justice
to
the
fine
qualities
which
accompanied
these
those
huge
stone
palaces
whose
portals
bore
the
magic
name
of
othmar
were
sacred
to
baron
fritz
as
his
temples
to
a
greek
his
nephew
never
passed
through
the
great
doors
of
any
one
of
them
without
a
sense
of
impatience
of
distaste
without
a
remembrance
of
the
thousand
people
who
had
died
of
hunger
in
croatia
whilst
marc
othmar
was
building
up
his
piles
of
ducats
and
florins
the
very
homage
with
which
he
was
himself
met
within
their
walls
irritated
him
he
thought
of
all
the
debasing
worship
the
earth
has
seen
the
worship
of
riches
was
the
most
corrupt
i
were
a
leper
they
would
kiss
my
ulcers
so
long
as
my
hand
could
sign
a
cheque
he
thought
after
all
when
marc
othmar
had
used
up
human
lives
in
the
furnace
of
his
speculations
he
had
used
up
material
which
was
but
of
little
worth
yet
despite
the
disdain
which
human
nature
can
not
do
otherwise
than
awaken
in
those
who
are
the
objects
of
its
adulation
if
they
keep
their
senses
clear
amidst
the
incense
fumes
his
heart
was
empty
have
people
here
asked
the
baron
a
little
later
his
vigilant
eyes
perceiving
the
preparations
which
were
being
made
in
the
little
theatre
attached
to
the
château
night
answered
othmar
small
dinner
i
hope
you
will
remain
for
it
and
as
talazac
sembrich
and
other
good
singers
are
at
nice
we
shall
have
some
music
afterwards
and
a
few
people
for
that
you
will
not
care
napraxines
are
here
enquired
his
uncle
with
a
little
smile
othmar
was
annoyed
to
feel
that
he
changed
colour
despite
himself
as
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
you
seen
her
said
friederich
othmar
carelessly
do
you
find
her
as
usual
is
no
woman
living
less
said
othmar
with
some
irritation
is
glad
to
make
the
care
of
her
health
a
pretext
when
she
is
disinclined
for
the
world
that
is
all
indeed
said
the
elder
man
great
rulers
are
allowed
to
be
ill
at
their
own
convenience
will
she
be
ill
or
well
night
will
show
replied
othmar
in
a
tone
which
closed
the
subject
chapter
x
it
was
a
tiny
church
which
bore
the
name
of
cecilia
at
pharamond
and
was
perched
on
an
knoll
with
the
rolling
woods
of
the
château
at
its
base
and
the
gardens
of
millo
on
its
right
nicole
sandroz
and
a
few
other
families
of
the
gathered
there
on
sundays
and
holy
days
but
the
great
people
of
millo
with
their
household
had
their
own
private
chapel
and
the
friends
to
whom
othmar
had
lent
his
house
had
never
troubled
themselves
to
find
their
way
to
the
little
whitewashed
sanctuary
and
the
lowly
presbytery
that
leaned
up
against
its
south
wall
othmar
himself
who
had
a
score
of
ecclesiastics
in
a
score
of
places
looking
to
him
for
support
had
hardly
known
that
this
little
church
and
its
old
purblind
curé
were
upon
the
confines
of
his
estate
he
had
paid
every
year
a
large
sum
for
the
maintenance
of
pharamond
as
for
that
of
each
of
his
houses
and
estates
but
he
had
never
examined
the
details
of
the
expenditure
the
advantage
of
an
immense
fortune
is
that
you
can
leave
all
such
matters
to
your
secretaries
he
paid
them
more
heed
than
many
would
have
done
because
of
the
views
he
entertained
on
the
duties
of
saving
other
people
from
temptation
but
pharamond
with
all
its
luxuries
elegancies
gardens
carriages
and
conservatories
was
only
to
him
as
a
mere
cottage
a
mere
toy
he
had
indeed
almost
forgotten
that
he
had
owned
it
until
beating
up
the
bay
of
genoa
in
a
and
almost
disabled
vessel
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that
somewhere
on
this
coast
which
slid
away
in
the
dusk
to
the
westward
he
had
a
harbour
and
a
quay
all
his
own
if
he
chose
to
go
thither
the
little
church
was
ugly
poor
and
had
been
built
since
the
revolution
all
that
redeemed
it
was
a
great
climbing
rose
which
covered
the
whole
of
its
front
and
was
even
flinging
audacious
branches
upwards
to
the
cross
upon
the
roof
in
summer
the
rose
made
the
little
plain
square
place
a
glory
of
pink
bloom
inside
there
were
a
few
deal
benches
a
few
bad
prints
a
humble
little
altar
and
some
pewter
candlesticks
the
presbytery
was
equally
as
bare
the
old
vicar
lived
with
one
servant
as
old
as
himself
he
toddled
out
amongst
the
farms
and
was
scouted
and
scowled
at
by
some
of
the
peasants
petted
and
welcomed
by
others
he
did
no
harm
and
was
quite
happy
if
one
of
his
parishioners
gave
him
a
basket
of
figs
or
a
dish
of
seakale
he
could
almost
have
counted
his
flock
on
his
fingers
the
men
about
there
were
very
radical
and
they
were
all
small
proprietors
who
cursed
millo
and
pharamond
all
the
year
round
though
neither
the
villa
nor
the
château
did
them
the
slightest
harm
on
the
contrary
the
stewards
of
both
the
duc
de
vannes
and
othmar
had
orders
to
give
away
any
rare
seeds
aid
in
any
or
contribute
to
any
need
that
there
might
be
in
the
neighbourhood
but
the
duc
was
a
duke
and
peer
of
france
and
othmar
was
an
archimillionaire
the
hated
the
sight
of
their
gilded
bronze
gates
and
their
glittering
roofs
is
for
you
that
we
pay
taxes
snarled
one
of
them
once
to
the
duc
de
vannes
who
laughed
and
answered
my
friend
if
we
compared
notes
i
think
you
would
find
that
it
is
i
who
pay
them
for
you
and
yours
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
do
so
only
do
not
let
us
misrepresent
matters
but
they
did
not
want
logic
and
they
hated
the
steep
shining
roofs
and
the
gates
with
the
gilded
scroll
work
what
they
did
not
hate
was
yseulte
de
valogne
all
countess
though
she
was
they
pardoned
her
that
defect
because
she
had
always
remained
for
them
pétiote
de
they
understood
that
she
was
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
pride
of
her
relatives
that
because
she
was
poor
so
poor
she
was
to
be
refused
all
the
joys
of
her
youth
and
her
sex
and
surrendered
to
the
church
that
she
might
not
offend
the
grandeur
of
her
family
by
making
a
portionless
marriage
this
which
they
had
learned
with
many
exaggerations
of
its
enormity
from
nicole
and
from
the
servants
of
millo
gave
her
the
halo
of
a
martyr
in
their
eyes
she
was
sacrificed
to
the
and
that
fact
was
enough
to
make
her
sacred
to
them
even
though
she
belonged
to
the
detested
order
herself
and
had
not
a
little
of
its
hauteur
besides
her
tenderness
to
their
old
people
the
little
gifts
she
made
at
the
convent
and
brought
to
their
little
ones
and
their
women
her
intrepidity
in
cases
of
sickness
in
those
winters
when
she
was
alone
at
millo
a
mere
child
but
with
the
courage
of
giants
as
nicole
loved
to
tell
all
these
joined
to
her
personal
elegance
which
made
her
as
unlike
themselves
as
the
orchids
in
othmar
hothouses
were
unlike
the
sweet
peas
and
the
lavender
growing
under
their
peach
trees
had
combined
to
make
of
the
last
comtesse
de
valogne
the
idol
of
which
with
few
exceptions
loathed
and
execrated
the
brilliant
idlers
who
rode
and
drove
out
of
the
gates
of
millo
and
carried
their
light
laughter
their
painted
fans
their
blazing
jewels
their
grace
and
their
luxuries
out
on
to
the
illuminated
terraces
under
the
palms
and
the
araucarias
amidst
the
lamps
and
the
music
regardless
of
the
people
in
the
distant
huts
and
houses
on
the
surrounding
hills
who
rising
to
their
work
as
they
went
to
their
beds
swore
savagely
against
them
with
all
the
unchanged
rancorous
of
the
terror
still
alive
in
them
and
unsatisfied
nicole
the
girl
said
often
to
her
there
were
no
rich
people
no
great
people
who
would
buy
your
your
december
peas
your
january
asparagus
should
eat
them
ourselves
said
nicole
sternly
might
do
that
now
but
i
do
not
think
that
eating
them
would
pay
you
for
all
they
cost
you
said
yseulte
not
very
sure
of
her
ground
and
therefore
timid
in
treading
it
should
not
grow
them
there
would
be
no
need
to
grow
them
said
nicole
obstinately
would
have
his
cabbage
in
his
pot
if
there
were
not
those
pestilent
aristocrats
and
rich
folks
you
might
plant
cabbages
now
insisted
her
should
you
not
plant
cabbages
everywhere
now
if
you
like
only
you
always
say
it
is
only
the
that
pay
well
you
belong
to
them
so
you
defend
them
grumbled
her
finding
the
argument
go
against
her
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
you
cut
off
all
your
beautiful
hair
and
cram
you
between
four
stone
walls
all
your
life
because
it
suits
their
pride
to
get
rid
of
you
can
not
live
better
than
in
god
service
said
yseulte
with
a
passing
blush
yes
one
can
muttered
nicole
one
is
sixteen
years
old
and
has
a
face
like
yours
one
could
have
a
gallant
lover
and
a
loyal
lord
a
home
of
one
own
and
children
one
after
another
at
breast
a
colour
like
that
of
the
red
winter
roses
which
she
was
binding
up
for
the
nice
markets
came
into
the
girl
cheeks
am
quite
happy
to
dedicate
my
life
to
our
mother
and
her
poor
she
said
in
that
tone
which
always
awed
and
silenced
nicole
that
i
fear
is
not
to
be
worthy
there
have
been
holy
women
of
my
race
i
may
never
content
them
as
they
watch
me
from
their
places
at
right
hand
the
coarse
blunt
fashion
of
speech
of
her
and
the
crude
and
political
animosities
which
nicole
had
imbibed
from
her
husband
often
pained
and
offended
the
delicacy
and
the
pride
of
the
girl
but
the
rough
woman
loved
her
was
almost
the
only
creature
that
did
love
her
save
some
of
the
younger
children
in
the
convent
and
yseulte
bore
with
her
faults
with
that
indulgent
affection
which
is
not
blind
but
patient
and
ever
forgiving
she
spoke
in
simplicity
and
sincerity
she
had
been
so
drilled
to
behold
her
only
future
in
the
religious
life
that
she
prayed
night
and
day
to
be
worthy
of
such
election
and
if
a
thrill
of
longing
for
unknown
freedom
for
unimaginable
joys
sometimes
came
over
her
she
loyally
stifled
it
ere
it
could
grow
to
any
strength
from
her
babyhood
she
had
been
taught
to
consider
herself
consecrated
to
the
church
and
that
knowledge
had
always
kept
her
a
little
apart
from
others
made
her
more
serious
more
sensitive
more
meditative
than
her
age
usually
is
to
be
sure
if
there
be
any
up
there
who
do
know
it
is
a
crying
shame
that
they
do
not
interfere
muttered
her
only
half
abashed
but
yseulte
did
not
hear
her
she
had
let
the
roses
lie
on
her
lap
her
hands
were
motionless
her
eyes
were
looking
far
away
farther
than
the
snow
which
crowned
the
distant
mountains
she
was
thinking
of
that
saint
by
whom
her
childhood
had
been
sheltered
could
it
indeed
be
that
so
great
a
love
as
her
grandmother
had
been
had
perished
utterly
had
gone
whither
it
knew
nothing
saw
nothing
had
no
power
to
warn
or
save
if
it
were
so
she
was
alone
indeed
but
do
not
think
of
them
said
nicole
roughly
is
dead
is
dead
my
sweet
be
it
a
pig
or
be
it
a
princess
when
the
life
is
out
the
sense
is
out
with
it
it
rots
but
it
does
not
wake
said
the
girl
with
a
little
frown
and
a
sense
of
pain
as
if
she
had
heard
some
foul
irreverence
the
dead
were
all
she
had
to
care
for
half
her
young
life
was
passed
in
thinking
of
them
in
praying
for
them
in
wondering
if
they
approved
that
which
she
did
will
give
you
your
dower
her
grandmother
had
said
often
to
her
a
little
child
who
had
vaguely
understood
that
her
future
was
pledged
to
heaven
and
that
she
must
never
be
fractious
or
noisy
or
sullen
or
give
way
to
appetite
or
mischief
as
other
children
did
who
were
less
honoured
it
had
made
her
neither
affected
nor
hypocritical
only
pathetically
doubtful
of
herself
and
capable
of
repressing
her
naturally
buoyant
spirits
with
an
incredible
patience
which
was
almost
heroism
but
went
always
unrewarded
faïel
was
a
part
of
the
old
world
of
bretagne
where
the
land
is
green
and
deeply
wooded
and
the
days
are
misty
and
soft
and
still
it
lies
inland
and
has
no
sight
of
the
sea
it
is
traversed
by
narrow
roads
sunk
down
low
between
walls
of
verdure
it
seems
all
covered
up
with
moss
and
ferns
and
boughs
there
is
always
moisture
in
the
air
and
there
are
almost
always
clouds
in
the
sky
but
it
is
a
sweet
tender
if
mournful
country
and
in
the
spring
becomes
a
very
bower
of
flowers
in
the
heart
of
this
green
country
the
ancient
village
of
faïel
held
the
equally
ancient
convent
of
the
holy
ladies
of
anne
with
its
long
grey
stone
walls
its
steep
shining
metal
roofs
and
its
high
belfry
with
its
cross
of
gilded
brass
towering
above
the
low
quaint
cottages
which
crept
humbly
up
beneath
it
many
centuries
ago
the
foundation
owed
its
origin
to
anne
of
bretagne
herself
and
year
after
year
century
after
century
undisturbed
by
wars
or
revolutions
and
unreached
by
any
change
of
thought
or
manners
the
pious
ladies
of
faïel
in
their
habits
of
black
and
white
had
reared
the
young
daughters
of
the
breton
nobility
and
gentry
in
the
ways
of
god
and
in
such
secular
learning
as
seemed
not
too
profane
the
community
was
severe
in
its
rules
and
austerely
simple
in
all
its
customs
but
the
children
were
happy
if
not
gay
the
green
leafy
silent
country
was
between
them
and
the
world
the
sisters
were
kind
and
gentle
the
young
girls
murmured
together
joyously
unreproved
like
young
swallows
chirping
under
the
eaves
in
midsummer
this
holy
house
in
pious
morbihan
was
wholly
unlike
those
fashionable
convents
of
paris
and
near
it
where
all
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
the
world
find
their
way
and
its
jealousies
and
its
rivalries
fret
and
fume
in
miniature
mimicry
the
dames
de
ste
anne
had
all
the
primitive
faiths
the
unblemished
loyalties
the
devout
beliefs
in
tradition
of
the
middle
ages
they
taught
the
history
of
france
from
religious
instead
of
secular
records
and
the
history
of
the
saints
from
the
golden
legend
they
worked
silver
lilies
on
white
banners
and
in
their
chapel
every
day
a
mass
was
said
for
henri
cinq
their
little
maidens
became
under
their
hands
simple
earnest
grave
and
most
innocent
and
truthful
creatures
ignorant
no
doubt
in
many
things
but
possessing
a
perfect
courage
and
a
beautiful
candour
such
maidens
as
in
the
old
days
from
the
combât
des
trente
to
quiberon
had
become
the
wives
and
mothers
of
the
breton
seigneurie
and
had
if

a
castle
and
headed
a
sally
of
in
the
holy
cause
of
their
duke
or
of
their
king
women
like
the
arum
lilies
that
covered
the
damp
green
earth
in
their
native
woods
women
whose
eyes
look
at
us
still
serious
and
serene
from
the
gold
blazonries
of
illuminated
missals
where
their
miniatures
have
been
painted
beneath
their
scutcheons
and
their
crowns
of
these
children
when
they
had
passed
from
the
gates
of
faïel
for
the
last
time
some
went
to
pass
all
their
years
in
the
small
secluded
châteaux
or
the
dull
towns
of
the
seashore
or
the
interior
some
finding
a
wider
flight
a
bolder
fate
went
into
the
life
of
the
world
and
lived
that
life
but
wherever
they
went
whatever
they
became
none
of
them
ever
wholly
forgot
faïel
all
of
them
when
they
bore
children
said
as
they
looked
on
their
little
daughters
shall
go
to
the
dames
de
ste
anne
so
that
generation
after
generation
came
to
the
great
gothic
gateway
and
passed
within
and
dwelt
there
for
eight
or
ten
peaceful
years
and
the
sisters
though
death
made
changes
amidst
them
yet
seemed
always
the
same
yseulte
who
was
a
fanciful
child
like
most
of
those
who
have
a
lonely
childhood
used
to
believe
that
they
were
like
that
woman
of
the
time
of
clovis
who
learned
the
secret
of
eternal
life
from
listening
to
the
singing
of
the
forest
birds
she
used
to
look
through
the
grating
down
the
deep
green
shade
of
the
woods
without
and
think
is
why
they
live
so
long
why
they
are
always
content
one
day
an
old
peasant
who
was
called
a
witch
in
faïel
saw
her
looking
so
and
heard
her
say
something
of
her
thoughts
to
her
companion
and
the
old
crone
shook
her
head
wisely
not
wish
to
live
long
wish
to
live
so
that
you
have
all
heaven
in
one
hour
it
is
not
the
birds
nor
is
it
the
woods
nor
is
it
the
saints
that
will
give
you
that
does
she
mean
said
yseulte
the
village
they
say
she
has
been
a
wicked
woman
said
the
girl
who
was
beside
her
yseulte
pondered
often
on
the
mysterious
words
but
she
could
never
understand
them
at
faïel
her
days
and
years
went
by
without
any
sorrow
if
without
any
pleasure
save
such
as
youth
and
perfect
health
and
willingness
to
accomplish
all
allotted
tasks
can
bring
with
them
she
always
wore
grey
or
black
or
white
no
colours
were
ever
seen
no
ornaments
were
ever
allowed
within
the
sacred
walls
she
was
regarded
as
certain
to
enter
the
religious
life
seras
des
said
the
nuns
so
often
to
her
that
before
she
was
ten
years
old
she
had
grown
so
imbued
with
the
idea
that
she
had
never
dreamed
of
resisting
such
a
destination
her
life
was
so
entirely
simple
in
a
way
so
barren
that
the
spiritual
world
assumed
a
proportion
in
it
which
would
have
been
morbid
had
not
the
high
courage
and
bodily
healthfulness
of
her
resisted
the
gloom
which
those
who
had
to
do
with
her
deemed
most
fitting
to
the
loneliness
of
her
lot
she
came
of
a
race
of
gay
nobles
of
reckless
soldiers
of
seigneurs
and
some
instincts
of
their
courage
of
their
temper
of
their
imprudence
stirred
in
her
now
and
then
beneath
the
calm
of
cloistral
habit
and
the
spirituality
of
her
natural
temperament
you
think
the
daughter
of
gui
de
valogne
will
ever
be
a
saint
the
duc
de
vannes
often
said
to
his
wife
he
thought
that
blood
would
out
even
beneath
the
coif
of
a
carmelite
his
wife
replied
that
the
valogne
had
always
kept
their
women
pure
if
at
the
sword
point
and
that
amongst
them
there
had
been
more
than
one
canonised
besides
she
added
yseulte
was
a
child
both
grave
and
good
she
would
never
know
the
world
or
its
temptations
she
would
live
and
die
as
a
lily
did
in
a
convent
garden
the
duc
shrugged
his
shoulders
has
her
father
blood
in
her
he
said
he
would
have
suited
no
cloister
but
roissy
or
medmenham
he
believed
in
very
few
things
but
his
one
belief
was
his
conviction
that
the
bias
of
a
race
goes
with
it
as
do
its
diseases
or
its
excellences
most
racing
men
are
implicit
believers
in
hereditary
influence
and
the
duc
who
had
bred
winners
at
chantilly
and
at
ascot
did
not
credit
that
the
daughter
of
gui
de
valogne
would
contentedly
become
a
ste
catherine
or
a
soeur
rose
course
you
may
shut
her
perforce
in
a
religious
house
so
might
you
shut
her
in
a
coffin
to
be
sure
the
one
murder
is
legal
and
the
other
would
not
be
so
he
said
with
some
the
night
after
othmar
noticed
his
young
cousin
with
her
long
black
gloves
her
stately
curtsy
her
sash
and
her
beautiful
figure
which
had
the
slimness
of
a
child
and
the
promise
of
a
goddess
believe
you
are
almost
in
love
with
her
yourself
said
the
duchess
wonder
no
one
else
is
wholly
he
answered
with
petulance
and
he
wrote
to
his
jeweller
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
for
a
locket
a
locket
something
with
pearls
he
thought
even
a
mother
superior
could
hardly
object
to
pearls
yseulte
all
unconscious
of
the
perilous
honour
projected
for
her
by
her
cousin
lord
passed
the
whole
day
up
at
the
little
church
arranging
the
flowers
which
othmar
had
given
her
in
the
morning
and
others
which
his
men
by
his
orders
had
brought
thither
in
the
forenoon
she
was
happier
than
she
had
been
since
her
grandmother
had
died
a
warm
human
interest
had
come
suddenly
into
the
monotony
and
solitude
of
her
existence
she
worked
at
the
decoration
of
the
little
place
with
ardour
and
delight
she
had
never
before
possessed
such
flowers
as
these
the
woods
had
yielded
all
those
which
had
ever
decked
the
altar
of
the
chapel
at
faïel
she
had
only
seen
such
gorgeous
blossoms
as
these
in
the
at
millo
where
she
would
no
more
have
dreamed
of
gathering
them
than
of
wearing
her
cousin
diamonds
shall
see
how
beautiful
it
looks
she
thought
with
each
blossom
that
she
added
each
leaf
she
touched
that
he
would
come
she
never
doubted
a
promise
ever
such
a
little
one
was
so
sacred
to
herself
that
for
any
pledge
to
be
forgotten
would
have
seemed
to
her
quite
impossible
the
old
vicar
came
and
went
the
sacristan
and
the
housekeeper
stood
and
chattered
and
told
her
for
the
hundredth
time
all
their
household
troubles
the
gay
sunshine
streamed
in
past
the
open
door
and
through
the
dulled
grey
glass
of
the
small
windows
a
goat
trotted
up
the
aisle
and
nibbled
at
the
bay
boughs
which
she
had
tied
together
the
morning
passed
like
a
pleasant
dream
it
seemed
not
december
to
her
but
may
she
was
but
a
child
and
for
once
the
weight
of
her
future
fell
off
her
young
shoulders
she
laughed
softly
because
she
sat
on
the
altar
steps
but
she
laughed
is
so
good
she
thought
in
the
simple
sincerity
of
her
glad
gratitude
will
let
me
sing
my
reverend
at
all
the
offices
she
said
to
the
old
man
when
she
had
finished
her
welcome
labours
and
stood
with
him
within
the
stone
porch
whilst
the
sun
was
setting
my
child
he
said
willingly
does
me
good
to
hear
your
voice
and
i
think
it
must
even
be
pleasant
to
the
angels
too
she
went
happily
along
the
uneven
little
path
which
led
down
the
hill
under
great
olive
trees
and
warm
evening
sunset
skies
to
millo
her
feet
went
so
rapidly
that
the
maid
whose
duty
it
was
to
attend
her
out
of
doors
could
ill
keep
pace
with
her
her
heart
was
so
light
she
had
the
vision
of
the
beautiful
flowers
always
before
her
eyes
of
the
altar
which
she
had
made
like
a
garden
it
mattered
nothing
to
her
that
when
she
entered
the
house
she
was
met
by
a
reprimand
that
she
found
her
simple
supper
cold
that
her
little
cousins
were
malicious
quarrelsome
unkind
all
those
were
trifles
she
bore
them
with
perfect
patience
and
with
never
a
word
of
harsh
reply
and
she
went
to
her
bed
and
slept
soundly
dreaming
of
roses
and
lilies
and
cecilia
and
of
a
world
of
angels
who
leaned
on
the
sunbeams
as
on
golden
spears
and
looked
down
on
her
and
smiled
she
was
up
long
before
the
first
gleam
of
coming
day
lightened
the
eastward
seas
no
one
ever
forbade
her
going
to
the
church
as
often
as
she
chose
they
deemed
it
in
unison
with
her
future
vocation
she
had
attached
herself
to
this
rude
lonely
little
place
in
the
winters
which
she
had
passed
there
under
the
charge
of
nicole
sandroz
her
cousin
had
said
once
that
it
would
be
better
if
she
attended
instead
the
offices
of
the
house
chapel
but
she
had
not
insisted
and
the
child
who
had
a
certain
obstinacy
in
her
affections
had
persevered
in
her
loyalty
to
the
parish
church
under
its
silvery
mist
of
olives
this
morning
her
was
in
waiting
to
accompany
her
the
cold
was
keen
in
the
greyness
of
the
dawn
the
sun
which
at
noon
would
vivify
the
winter
landscape
to
warmth
was
still
hidden
in
the
nether
world
the
earth
and
the
sea
were
dark
the
stars
still
lingered
in
the
shadowy
skies
folly
muttered
nicole
who
had
her
lanthorn
get
up
out
of
your
bed
to
go
and
sing
an
ave
if
it
were
to
pack
a
crate
of
oranges
there
would
be
some
sense
please
said
yseulte
gently
grandmère
hears
the
memory
of
the
old
marquise
always
touched
and
silenced
the
irreligious
grumbling
of
nicole
she
said
nothing
more
but
toiled
on
stoutly
her
lanthorn
twinkling
amongst
the
rough
grass
white
with
passing
frost
child
would
be
best
in
her
bed
she
thought
there
is
one
thing
she
never
takes
cold
one
would
like
to
think
the
saints
had
a
care
of
her
but
that
is
all
rubbish
even
our
mayor
says
so
now
and
he
is
such
a
dunderhead
what
he
can
not
stomach
nobody
can
still
nicole
who
came
to
mass
for
her
sake
though
the
good
woman
in
her
soul
hated
the
bigots
the
black
beetles
of
the
church
held
on
her
way
up
the
hill
stumbling
over
the
roots
of
the
old
olives
it
pleased
the
that
she
should
come
and
after
all
it
could
do
no
harm
eager
proud
joyous
more
joyous
she
feared
than
was
meet
for
the
sanctity
of
the
hour
and
the
errand
yseulte
led
her
into
the
church
as
the
first
pale
light
of
daybreak
spread
itself
over
the
earth
you
will
see
how
beautiful
it
is
she
murmured
to
nicole
alas
the
fair
garden
she
had
made
and
left
at
twilight
was
a
ruin
now
where
she
had
caused
the
metal
and
the
wood
and
the
stone
to
bloom
as
with
the
blossoms
of
paradise
there
were
only
poor
pale
yellow
withered
things
colourless
as
ashes
the
frost
of
the
night
had
stolen
the
glory
from
the
flowers
as
the
hand
of
the
church
would
strike
the
youth
from
her
life
and
leave
it
hard
and
dumb
as
a
stone
the
blossoms
had
died
of
cold
like
little
children
lost
in
the
snow
like
bright
butterflies
beaten
down
and
drowned
in
a
storm
of
hail
a
low
pathetic
cry
of
grief
escaped
her
as
she
saw
the
lovely
things
which
she
so
ignorantly
and
innocently
had
slain
hanging
their
folded
petals
in
the
chill
glimmer
of
the
early
day
as
the
limbs
of
infants
hang
in
death
her
eyes
filled
with
hot
quick
tears
that
ran
down
her
cheeks
look
oh
look
she
cried
piteously
could
you
expect
said
nicole
with
rough
sympathy
you
bring
hothouse
flowers
from
under
their
glass
our
nights
are
cold
my
man
said
last
night
it
was
two
below
zero
by
the
mercury
tube
in
our
wall
do
not
cry
you
could
not
help
it
you
did
not
think
of
it
children
never
do
think
but
bay
and
laurel
and
all
those
common
shrubs
are
best
fit
to
stand
the
cold
of
the
church
these
things
are
only
aristocrats
nicole
checked
herself
she
remembered
the
marquise
de
creusac
with
the
frost
of
poverty
and
cruel
loss
upon
her
meeting
misfortune
with
serene
courage
and
unchanging
dignity
her
comparison
she
saw
halted
and
failed
yseulte
did
not
hear
she
was
thinking
piteously
i
did
so
want
him
to
see
how
beautiful
it
all
looked
through
his
kindness
she
was
quite
sure
that
othmar
would
come
to
one
office
or
another
during
the
day
she
was
ashamed
to
be
so
occupied
with
this
one
thought
when
the
drone
of
the
acolyte
was
chanting
in
monotonous
the
opening
words
of
the
mass
but
it
was
stronger
than
herself
she
thought
of
nothing
else
to
her
own
surprise
and
confusion
she
was
wholly
unable
to
keep
her
mind
to
the
holy
offices
of
the
hour
for
the
first
time
the
sonorous
latin
words
failed
to
carry
her
soul
with
them
she
was
glancing
while
she
knelt
at
the
closed
rickety
door
she
was
wondering
whilst
she
sang
the
dei
would
he
come
she
had
taken
such
infinite
pains
with
the
flowers
and
now
all
their
beauty
was
gone
they
were
only
faded
melancholy
wrecks
of
themselves
disfiguring
the
altar
rather
than
lending
it
grace
and
glory
pétiote
thought
nicole
fingering
her
beads
and
bending
her
stiff
knees
from
habit
frost
will
come
just
like
that
to
her
and
nobody
will
care
often
have
i
a
mind
to
go
up
to
millo
and
tell
them
it
is
a
shame
a
vile
shame
but
they
would
not
care
they
would
have
me
turned
out
for
an
old
mad
woman
the
church
was
very
dark
the
few
lights
there
were
did
not
dissipate
the
shadows
of
the
dawn
the
clear
melodious
voice
of
yseulte
rose
in
the
gloom
as
a
nightingale
does
in
the
lovelier
dusk
of
a
midsummer
daybreak
all
her
heart
thrilled
out
in
it
and
when
the
last
notes
sank
to
silence
there
was
a
tremor
as
of
tears
in
them
nicole
heart
swelled
too
as
she
heard
half
with
pain
half
with
rage
would
sooner
she
were
singing
do
do
dor
by
her
baby
cradle
thought
this
heathen
she
attended
every
office
of
the
church
during
the
next
twelve
hours
but
othmar
came
not
to
one
of
them
with
vespers
all
hope
of
seeing
him
there
such
a
vague
innocent
hope
as
it
was
had
perished
quite
like
the
orchids
on
the
altar
the
day
was
over
the
church
had
once
more
no
light
except
that
of
its
twinkling
candles
the
peasants
shuffled
to
their
feet
and
clattered
out
over
the
stones
nicole
began
to
chatter
to
the
maid
the
old
vicar
had
tottered
into
the
sacristy
and
was
pulling
off
his
vestments
the
last
office
was
done
the
butterfly
orchids
were
dying
in
the
stench
of
the
sputtering
candlewicks
the
acolyte
a
ploughboy
in
a
short
linen
tunic
which
showed
his
hobnailed
boots
began
to
put
the
wicks
out
with
a
brass
extinguisher
fixed
at
the
end
of
a
long
stick
she
thought
she
would
never
bring
flowers
there
any
more
it
was
cruel
they
withered
and
faded
and
who
could
tell
what
they
might
suffer
she
had
never
remembered
that
before
the
flowers
had
died
in
the
service
of
the
church
so
would
she
it
had
seldom
seemed
hard
before
while
the
two
women
chattered
in
low
tones
of
the
doings
of
millo
she
turned
quickly
back
to
the
and
knelt
down
there
and
said
one
last
prayer
confusedly
conscious
that
she
had
been
at
fault
all
through
the
mass
in
thinking
of
other
things
than
the
holy
services
in
which
she
had
taken
part
she
rose
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
went
out
through
the
little
dark
aisle
between
the
two
women
leaving
the
poor
lost
flowers
in
a
confused
and
shadowy
mass
upon
the
altar
until
dawn
to
be
tossed
away
and
thrust
out
under
the
sacristan
broom
to
the
othmar
had
not
come
he
was
sitting
at
his
own
table
with
the
princess
napraxine
at
his
right
hand
the
girl
could
see
the
lighted
windows
of
his
château
as
she
walked
down
under
the
olives
through
the
dusky
furrows
already
dotted
with
blades
of
corn
the
women
still
chattering
as
they
came
behind
her
the
woods
of
millo
black
under
the
moon
the
stars
shining
a
distant
watchdog
giving
tongue
are
late
said
her
kissing
her
hand
at
the
door
of
the
house
it
will
not
matter
they
are
all
dining
at
count
othmar
if
no
one
of
those
cats
of
gouvernantes
tell
the
duchesse
she
will
be
none
the
wiser
is
nothing
to
conceal
cried
yseulte
a
little
coldly
cousin
knows
that
i
go
out
to
vespers
as
well
as
mass
good
night
she
kissed
her
nurse
on
the
cheek
and
went
up
the
staircase
of
millo
her
heart
had
contracted
with
a
sort
of
pang
as
she
heard
the
idle
words
are
all
dining
at
count
othmar
she
did
not
wonder
that
he
had
not
invited
her
no
one
invited
her
anywhere
she
was
a
schoolgirl
now
and
would
be
a
nun
later
on
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
world
and
yet
her
heart
ached
a
little
she
did
not
touch
the
coffee
and
the
cakes
that
her
maid
brought
her
she
sat
at
the
window
of
her
own
little
room
and
looked
every
now
and
then
out
into
the
chilly
night
and
across
the
moonlit
landscape
to
the
towers
of
pharamond
there
were
points
of
light
of
all
colours
sparkling
in
the
darkness
round
the
château
they
were
the
lamps
of
his
gardens
which
were
illuminated
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
she
felt
a
great
longing
to
cry
like
a
little
child
but
she
would
not
yield
to
it
only
two
great
tears
rolled
slowly
down
her
cheeks
she
knew
that
she
had
been
very
foolish
to
expect
him
at
the
church
only
he
had
said
that
he
would
come
chapter
xi
a
few
mornings
later
after
his
noonday
breakfast
alain
de
vannes
sauntered
out
into
the
rose
gardens
of
his
wife
having
seen
there
the
figure
of
his
wife
young
cousin
in
her
demure
grey
dress
with
the
cape
of
sable
which
he
was
just
then
in
the
mood
to
think
the
prettiest
female
garb
in
the
world
he
went
up
to
her
with
easy
and
courtesy
as
became
her
kinsman
and
her
host
cousin
he
said
tenderly
have
no
trinkets
and
pretty
things
as
a
little
lady
of
your
years
should
have
i
believe
there
are
all
that
are
left
of
the
valogne
jewels
waiting
for
you
in
strong
coffers
but
meantime
here
is
a
little
bird
that
will
whisper
to
you
pretty
things
if
you
will
listen
to
him
you
may
wear
a
dove
you
know
at
the
convent
itself
it
is
the
bird
of
the
holy
spirit
and
with
that
he
gave
her
what
he
had
telegraphed
for
from
paris
a
locket
of
blue
enamel
rimmed
with
pearls
and
a
dove
made
of
pearls
flying
on
it
it
hung
from
a
thick
gold
chain
she
was
so
astonished
that
she
could
not
speak
the
duc
watched
her
with
amusement
he
thought
is
much
more
entertaining
to
give
to
the
than
to
the
what
wonder
what
delight
what
innocent
gratitude
and
the
others
only
box
your
ears
if
the
diamonds
be
not
big
enough
or
the
emeralds
do
not
please
them
really
we
are
fools
yseulte
meanwhile
had
not
spoken
yet
what
moved
her
so
intensely
was
not
the
gift
of
the
medallion
itself
splendid
though
it
was
but
the
idea
that
anyone
had
had
so
much
remembrance
of
her
she
had
scarcely
had
more
notice
than
a
careless
bow
or
a
brief
from
her
cousin
husband
in
all
her
life
and
now
he
brought
her
this
magnificent
present
and
yet
how
much
sooner
she
would
have
had
othmar
remember
to
go
and
hear
her
sing
said
the
duc
gaily
look
as
if
you
were
not
sure
whether
you
were
in
earth
or
in
heaven
are
not
when
we
look
at
you
is
most
good
of
you
it
is
most
beautiful
she
said
with
hesitation
you
should
have
thought
of
me
is
so
kind
but
i
fear
i
ought
not
to
wear
it
you
know
in
two
years
time
i
am
to
enter
the
carmelite
communion
it
is
the
bird
of
the
holy
spirit
said
de
vannes
with
an
ambiguous
smile
think
you
may
wear
it
when
you
are
an
abbess
if
ever
you
be
an
abbess
ah
my
child
it
is
a
cruel
thing
to
doom
you
to
the
religious
life
only
ugly
women
should
go
there
and
you
are
so
handsome
you
will
be
so
handsome
no
she
said
quickly
she
blushed
very
much
she
had
been
always
told
that
it
was
a
sin
to
think
of
any
physical
charms
and
yet
she
had
enough
of
the
instincts
of
a
beautiful
woman
in
her
to
take
an
unconscious
delight
in
the
whiteness
of
her
limbs
the

eyes
from

de
vannes
still
with
that
smile
which
vaguely
hurt
her
will
be
marvellously
handsome
yseulte
i
think
that
is
the
chief
reason
why
the
ladies
wish
you
in
the
cloister
it
was
certainly
the
reason
why
they
would
not
take
you
to
othmar
last
night
to
be
sure
you
are
not
in
the
world
but
in
the
country
they
might
have
made
an
exception
you
are
seen
in
our
she
lifted
her
eyes
with
eager
appeal
he
ask
me
did
he
think
of
me
she
said
under
her
breath
the
keen
glance
of
the
duc
flashed
over
her
face
and
grew
harsh
and
suspicious
he
spoke
to
you
once
he
thought
suppose
though
you
be
a
young
saint
in
embryo
you
are
not
proof
against
his
millions
you
are
all
alike
after
all
you
women
even
in
the
bud
aloud
he
said
i
believe
othmar
bade
my
wife
bring
you
perhaps
she
thought
it
was
too
much
like
the
great
world
for
you
it
was
a
brilliant
affair
all
done
for
the
princess
napraxine
is
the
princess
napraxine
she
asked
surprised
at
her
own
temerity
is
the
lady
of
othmar
dreams
said
de
vannes
with
an
unkind
satisfaction
are
sure
to
see
her
here
sometime
what
did
you
think
of
him
the
other
night
you
know
i
suppose
that
he
could
buy
up
all
france
if
he
chose
did
not
know
she
murmured
i
think
said
that
he
was
rich
echoed
the
duc
with
derision
is
not
a
word
to
describe
othmar
he
has
about
a
million
millions
and
he
would
probably
be
happier
if
he
were
the
blind
beggar
of
the
pont
neuf
his
millions
do
not
do
anything
for
him
with
nadine
napraxine
and
it
is
only
for
nadine
napraxine
that
he
exists
then
he
paused
the
respect
for
jeune
by
which
the
most
dissolute
of
his
countrymen
is
restrained
from
long
habit
making
him
repress
the
sentence
he
had
on
his
lips
that
momentary
flush
and
light
of
happiness
at
being
remembered
by
othmar
which
he
had
seen
on
his
young
cousin
face
had
made
him
bitter
against
his
neighbour
and
friend
and
he
would
willingly
have
continued
his
sarcasms
on
a
man
who
with
all
the
world
at
his
feet
cared
only
for
another
wife
who
laughed
at
him
yseulte
listened
with
serious
and
wistful
eyes
she
did
not
know
enough
of
his
meaning
nor
enough
of
the
sympathy
which
had
attracted
her
towards
othmar
to
understand
why
she
felt
a
vague
pain
at
hearing
these
things
said
of
him
mingled
with
a
delighted
gratitude
that
he
had
remembered
her
it
was
not
to
have
gone
to
his
party
that
she
cared
for
but
to
be
remembered
by
him
the
children
and
their
governesses
approached
her
at
that
moment
and
the
duc
somewhat
hurriedly
turned
away
not
let
these
fools
see
your
locket
he
said
quickly
meaning
by
that
epithet
the
wise
women
who
educated
his
daughters
notice
it
tell
her
of
course
yseulte
surprised
at
the
injunction
looked
at
him
in
wonder
but
she
saw
so
much
irritation
in
his
expression
that
being
accustomed
to
obey
the
orders
of
others
without
comment
and
to
be
taught
that
silence
was
one
of
the
first
of
duties
she
put
his
gift
in
her
pocket
as
the
children
approached
and
their
father
with
a
petulant
word
or
two
turned
away
lighting
a
cigar
was
saying
to
you
cried
the
little
sisters
in
a
breath
they
were
pretty
children
with
clouds
of
hair
and
saucy
peevish
little
faces
they
wore
sailor
dresses
made
very
short
at
the
knee
and
showing
legs
very
shapely
though
too
thin
blanchette
was
blonde
toinon
was
a
little
darker
and
rosier
blanchette
was
the
more
elegant
and
the
more
witty
by
far
toinon
was
the
sturdier
and
the
naughtier
but
toinon
had
still
something
of
childhood
left
in
her
blanchette
had
lost
every
atom
of
hers
years
before
though
she
was
only
ten
years
old
now
toinon
loved
horses
dogs
boats
and
generally
blanchette
only
cared
for
smart
frocks
things
which
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
scandal
which
she
overheard
and
which
fascinated
her
in
proportion
as
it
was
unintelligible
to
her
and
the
sense
that
she
was
looked
at
admiringly
as
she
drove
behind
the
ponies
in
the
bois
or
walked
with
a
court
of
small
boys
behind
her
down
the
planks
at
trouville
between
her
two
cousins
and
yseulte
de
valogne
there
was
a
great
gulf
fixed
that
gulf
into
which
there
has
fallen
so
much
of
the
innocence
of
youth
of
the
grace
of
good
manners
of
the
charm
of
girlhood
and
of
the
obligation
of
nobility
that
gulf
over
which
modern
society
dances
so
lightly
blind
and
indifferent
to
all
it
has
lost
was
saying
cried
blanchette
and
toinon
in
one
breath
their
eyes
wide
open
with
curiosity
and
sparkling
with
suspicion
yseulte
hesitated
she
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
and
a
kind
of
oppression
came
upon
her
with
the
sense
of
the
gift
and
the
secret
which
she
had
to
keep
and
conceal
was
telling
me
that
i
was
invited
there
last
night
she
said
as
she
looked
across
at
the
trees
of
pharamond
they
thought
me
not
old
enough
she
added
with
an
unconscious
sigh
blanchette
turned
up
her
little
delicate
nose
in
the
air
nigaude
va
she
said
contemptuously
will
never
be
anything
but
a
big
baby
you
when
i
am
as
old
as
you
i
shall
have
been
married
a
whole
year
to
a
crown
prince
and
have
gone
to
all
the
theatres
and
read
all
the
newspapers
every
one
she
will
never
see
a
newspaper
and
never
go
to
a
theatre
never
never
never
a
big
never
cried
toinon
who
was
two
years
younger
than
blanchette
as
she
clapped
her
hands
and
capered
does
not
care
she
is
such
a
stupid
said
blanchette
with
all
the
superiority
of
measureless
scorn
was
giving
you
something
what
did
he
give
you
said
toinon
said
you
were
handsome
the
other
night
to
mamma
i
heard
him
mamma
was
angry
did
not
care
said
blanchette
it
had
been
the
marquis
raymond
then
the
little
sisters
laughed
yseulte
with
difficulty
escaped
from
her
little
tormentors
and
wandered
alone
through
the
pretty
grounds
while
the
closed
shutters
of
the
villa
of
millo
showed
that
her
cousin
and
her
were
still
sleeping
after
the
cotillon
with
which
othmar
party
had
closed
an
improvised
and
unexpected
cotillon
for
which
nevertheless
there
had
been
all
manner
of
admirable
surprises
marvellous
novelties
and
costly
presents
when
she
was
quite
alone
she
took
out
her
pearl
medallion
and
looked
at
it
with
all
a
child
rapture
at
a
toy
and
something
of
a
pleasure
in
a
jewel
the
kindness
of
her
cousin
de
vannes
overwhelmed
her
she
had
known
him
now
and
then
as
she
passed
the
doors
of
the
or
watched
the
drag
roll
out
of
the
courtyard
give
her
a
careless
nod
and
a
lazy
word
or
two
but
never
any
more
notice
than
that
which
was
as
much
as
blanchette
and
toinon
ever
received
from
him
at
such
times
as
he
had
come
down
to
bois
le
roy
or
millo
when
she
was
there
she
had
heard
of
him
as
a
man
only
devoted
to
horses
and
dogs
to
sport
of
all
sorts
to
his
and
and
to
his
coach
and
his
stud
and
his
great
she
knew
that
he
was
a
very
grand
gentleman
in
paris
and
at
bois
le
roy
despite
all
revolutions
was
a
kind
of
king
and
he
had
thought
about
her
so
much
that
he
had
bought
her
a
locket
she
could
scarcely
believe
it
she
sat
in
a
little
nook
made
by
magnolias
that
overhung
the
sea
and
saw
the
sun
shine
on
her
dove
of
pearls
and
wondered
if
she
would
dare
to
wear
it
would
the
duchess
approve
of
it
there
was
only
one
thing
which
disturbed
her
it
was
his
recommendation
to
silence
there
had
been
a
look
in
his
eyes
too
when
he
had
said
are
very
handsome
which
haunted
her
with
a
vague
uneasiness
she
was
too
utterly
innocent
to
be
alarmed
by
it
but
a
certain
instinct
in
her
shrank
from
the
remembrance
of
that
regard
it
was
the
first
look
of
sensual
admiration
which
had
been
ever
given
her
and
though
he
had
added
course
you
must
tell
he
had
said
it
grudgingly
as
though
he
would
willingly
if
he
could
have
ventured
to
do
so
have
bidden
her
keep
his
gift
a
secret
from
his
wife
you
counting
your
jewels
mademoiselle
de
valogne
said
the
voice
of
othmar
that
until
you
are
thirty
years
older
and
need
their
aid
without
any
thought
of
her
he
had
been
strolling
on
the
rocks
above
the
little
harbour
which
belonged
equally
to
pharamond
and
to
millo
he
had
been
bathing
and
swimming
and
was
returning
to
his
house
when
he
caught
sight
of
her
seated
beneath
the
magnolias
yseulte
coloured
and
rose
to
her
feet
dropping
the
medallion
in
her
surprise
as
his
voice
startled
her
from
her
meditation
othmar
picked
it
up
and
returned
it
to
her
a
happy
trinket
to
hold
your
thoughts
so
long
he
said
as
he
did
so
have
been
watching
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
you
have
never
ceased
to
look
at
that
most
fortunate
jewel
cousin
the
duc
de
vannes
gave
it
to
me
a
moment
ago
she
answered
him
vexed
that
he
should
suppose
she
could
care
so
much
for
any
trifle
vannes
echoed
othmar
in
some
surprise
did
not
know
he
had
so
much
good
taste
in
the
selection
either
of
his
gifts
or
their
recipients
it
is
a
very
pretty
medallion
he
added
noticing
her
look
of
distress
and
of
bewilderment
dove
is
admirably
done
i
hope
it
will
be
an
emblem
of
the
peace
which
will
always
remain
with
you
she
did
not
speak
the
quick
sensitiveness
of
her
instincts
made
her
feel
the
satire
of
his
felicitations
and
become
conscious
that
for
some
reason
or
another
he
disapproved
the
gift
which
she
had
received
have
never
had
any
present
before
from
anyone
she
said
simply
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
i
do
not
mean
only
because
it
is
pretty
because
of
the
affection
it
represents
i
understand
said
othmar
while
he
thought
to
himself
de
vannes
must
he
even
bring
his
indecencies
to
millo
and
try
and
corrupt
a
poor
helpless
child
the
man
would
not
spend
twenty
francs
out
of
mere
good
nature
nor
look
at
her
twice
out
of
mere
compassion
he
looked
at
her
himself
now
where
she
sat
under
the
magnolia
branches
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
she
were
the
dove
and
he
saw
the
hawk
descending
alain
de
vannes
could
be
seductive
when
he
chose
he
was
and
extremely
distinguished
was
accustomed
to
conquest
and
had
that
charm
of
manner
which
the
habit
of
the
world
and
the
society
of
women
make
second
nature
if
his
fancy
had
lighted
on
his
wife
cousin
he
would
not
be
likely
to
pause
because
she
was
penniless
lonely
and
consecrated
to
a
spiritual
life
ought
to
put
her
on
her
guard
and
yet
who
could
venture
to
do
that
he
thought
he
at
all
events
had
no
title
to
do
so
and
if
he
had
he
could
not
willingly
have
been
the
first
to
tell
her
that
under
the
roses
there
were
vipers
that
behind
the
dew
and
the
sunrise
there
were
evil
fires
burning
you
stay
long
at
millo
he
asked
abruptly
came
here
for
two
months
she
said
were
all
sent
away
there
was
fever
i
have
been
here
often
before
i
am
very
fond
of
millo
would
they
not
let
you
honour
me
last
night
do
not
go
into
the
world
at
all
i
never
shall
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
added
timidly
was
very
kind
to
think
of
me
would
not
be
easy
to
forget
you
said
othmar
with
a
sincerity
which
surprised
himself
wish
you
had
been
with
us
yours
is
the
age
for
and
enjoyment
i
should
like
to
see
you
at
your
first
ball
shall
never
go
to
a
ball
it
would
not
be
thought
right
do
you
never
rebel
against
so
harsh
a
destiny
she
coloured
to
her
eyes
as
she
answered
almost
inaudibly
yes
but
then
i
know
that
it
is
i
who
am
wrong
and
they
who
are
right
are
they
mother
superior
my
uncle
de
creusac
by
his
will
my
cousin
aurore
everyone
that
i
belong
to
at
all
my
grandmother
especially
desired
it
makes
one
wish
all
the
world
were
agnostic
did
you
say
agnostic
was
not
a
word
she
had
been
allowed
to
hear
say
that
it
is
a
cruel
thing
to
force
on
you
such
a
choice
at
least
you
should
be
allowed
to
know
what
you
do
ere
you
do
it
you
should
see
what
the
world
is
like
before
you
renounce
it
i
can
fancy
that
women
tired
unlovely
unloved
feeble
of
health
may
be
glad
of
the
refuge
of
religious
life
but
you
you
think
one
should
only
give
god
what
is
weary
and
worn
out
she
said
softly
one
should
give
one
best
othmar
was
touched
by
the
words
and
the
tone
to
him
whose
boyhood
had
been
filled
with
spiritual
faiths
and
hopes
and
whose
manhood
had
the
pain
of
knowledge
that
all
these
gracious
myths
and
wistful
desires
were
but
mere
dreams
there
was
the
echo
of
remembered
adorations
of
exquisite
unreasoning
beliefs
in
the
simple
answer
which
bespoke
that
faith
in
heaven
which
a
child
has
in
its
mother
unquestioning
undoubting
implicit
in
obedience
and
in
trust
beside
the
cultured
mind
of
the
woman
he
loved
with
its
fine
scepticism
its
delicate
ironies
its
contemptuous
rejections
its
intellectual
scorn
no
doubt
this
simple
narrow
unintelligent
faith
was
foolish
and
childish
and
out
of
date
yet
it
touched
him
in
yseulte
de
valogne
it
had
an
unconscious
heroism
a
beautiful
repose
which
lifted
it
out
of
the
cramped
rigidity
of
creeds
and
the
apathy
of
ignorance
there
were
beneath
her
gravity
and
spirituality
a
warmth
a
vitality
a
latent
force
which
seemed
to
him
to
cry
aloud
for
enjoyment
and
expansion
sooner
or
later
all
that
teeming
life
slumbering
in
her
would
awake
and
demand
its
common
rights
no
creature
perfectly
organised
and
full
of
health
and
strength
can
forego
the
natural
joys
of
human
existence
without
suffering
a
thousand
deaths
as
yet
no
doubt
she
was
as
innocent
as
ignorant
of
the
tyranny
of
the
senses
as
any
shell
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
blue
waters
yonder
she
might
have
fallen
from
heaven
that
day
for
aught
she
knew
of
all
which
in
her
unconsciousness
she
was
ready
to
renounce
but
any
hour
that
divine
innocence
might
be
destroyed
by
a
word
banished
at
a
touch
alain
de
vannes
or
any
other
might
choose
to
find
sport
in
waking
and
in
slaying
it
and
then
how
unhappy
she
would
be
how
like
a
bird
freshly
captured
and
beating
itself
to
death
against
the
bars
it
was
only
in
france
that
a
and
beautiful
girl
could
be
sacrificed
thus
because
she
had
no
dower
everywhere
else
women
without
dowers
were
sought
and
taken
in
marriage
every
day
as
if
a
few
hundred
thousand
francs
were
needful
to
make
youth
and
loveliness
and
purity
and
high
lineage
acceptable
to
men
know
my
cousin
the
duc
very
well
she
said
timidly
after
a
long
silence
have
lived
in
the
same
world
i
have
not
been
intimate
with
him
you
think
he
would
be
very
vexed
if
i
asked
nicole
that
is
my
to
sell
this
locket
for
me
fear
he
would
not
be
best
pleased
why
should
you
wish
to
sell
it
she
hesitated
then
answered
want
to
buy
the
vicar
that
new
gown
he
wants
so
much
he
will
never
spend
a
centime
on
himself
and
his
gown
has
been
mended
and
mended
and
mended
it
is
all
a
patchwork
and
even
that
is
dropping
to
pieces
and
the
bishop
visitation
is
near
at
hand
i
thought
the
value
of
this
locket
would
buy
a
priest
gown
if
my
cousin
de
vannes
would
not
be
angry
is
a
pretty
thought
of
you
it
would
certainly
buy
many
said
othmar
i
think
alain
would
not
be
at
all
pleased
if
you
sold
his
present
and
i
told
you
the
other
day
that
i
will
give
the
curé
a
new
gown
myself
with
the
very
utmost
pleasure
you
say
that
i
belong
to
his
parish
she
smiled
nevertheless
she
hesitated
to
accept
his
offer
must
have
so
many
things
to
give
nicole
says
that
people
are
always
asking
you
for
things
do
not
always
get
them
replied
othmar
with
a
smile
they
wished
only
for
such
useful
and
harmless
things
as
they
should
always
have
their
wish
you
so
immensely
rich
then
she
asked
him
opening
widely
her
eyes
which
looked
as
if
the
sunshine
was
always
shining
in
them
my
misfortune
said
othmar
annoyed
could
not
even
a
child
of
sixteen
out
of
a
convent
forget
his
riches
was
it
possible
she
too
was
going
to
ask
him
for
something
she
looked
at
him
gravely
wonder
you
do
not
build
a
cathedral
she
said
after
a
pause
cathedral
he
echoed
in
surprise
would
if
i
had
the
faith
of
those
who
used
to
do
so
is
what
i
would
do
if
i
had
money
said
she
still
very
gravely
would
build
one
in
the
heart
of
a
forest
with
the
deer
and
the
birds
all
round
it
not
jammed
up
amongst
streets
and
crowds
like
nôtre
dame
or
chartres
then
a
sudden
sense
came
over
her
that
she
was
violating
all
the
rules
of
propriety
by
which
her
life
was
ordered
in
thus
speaking
out
her
thoughts
to
one
who
was
almost
a
stranger
in
tarrying
at
all
by
the
side
of
a
man
who
was
of
no
parentage
to
her
she
rose
a
little
hurriedly
but
with
the
stately
grace
which
was
natural
to
her
the
grace
of
old
versailles
and
marly
think
i
must
go
back
to
the
house
she
said
with
a
little
shyness
cousin
does
not
like
me
to
be
alone
or
to
talk
to
anyone
duchesse
will
not
object
to
me
said
othmar
with
the
same
smile
as
he
had
had
when
using
the
same
words
a
few
days
before
mademoiselle
you
are
in
another
world
than
your
convent
at
millo
men
are
not
thought
dragons
and
tigers
we
are
poor
creatures
indeed
but
harmless
more
injured
than
injuring
do
not
be
so
alarmed
i
want
you
to
tell
me
a
great
deal
more
about
our
vicar
where
am
i
to
get
his
measure
for
his
gown
will
he
be
surprised
with
it
will
you
not
let
me
send
it
to
you
that
you
may
take
it
to
him
i
should
be
ashamed
to
do
so
i
have
never
been
inside
his
church
even
to
hear
you
sing
you
never
came
yesterday
she
said
with
a
sigh
innocently
revealing
that
she
had
remarked
his
absence
with
regret
my
shame
and
loss
i
did
not
i
had
my
uncle
with
me
all
the
day
and
at
night
a
dinner
a
concert
and
the
to
which
i
hoped
you
would
have
been
brought
i
can
not
dance
said
the
child
blushing
very
much
as
she
made
the
humiliating
confession
much
the
better
said
othmar
inconsistently
am
sure
however
that
you
would
dance
with
admirable
grace
if
you
danced
at
all
anyone
who
moves
well
can
dance
well
this
time
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
was
that
of
pleasure
at
his
praise
she
was
silent
looking
at
him
a
little
wistfully
recalling
what
de
vannes
had
said
of
the
princess
napraxine
the
kindliness
of
his
tone
its
mingling
of
familiarity
and
reverence
melted
her
reserve
and
disarmed
her
shyness
there
had
been
that
in
the
compliment
of
alain
de
vannes
which
had
startled
and
alarmed
her
but
in
the
almost
paternal
gentleness
and
friendliness
of
words
there
was
nothing
to
do
so
he
had
little
to
her
of
the
chillness
and
languid
irony
which
often
frightened
even
women
in
him
whilst
he
had
all
the
graceful
courtesy
of
a
man
polished
by
all
the
habits
of
the
great
world
and
accustomed
to
that
which
gives
supreme
ease
of
manner
to
her
othmar
seemed
a
hero
a
king
an
ideal
among
men
when
her
cousin
had
said
to
her
that
this
person
so
powerful
so
great
and
so
rich
was
also
unhappy
he
had
said
the
only
thing
needed
to
complete
his
fascination
for
her
and
to
make
him
the
master
of
her
dreams
he
bowed
low
before
her
with
a
sense
of
something
holier
than
was
often
met
with
in
this
world
and
looked
after
her
as
she
sped
over
the
lawns
to
the
house
beautiful
creature
with
a
tender
heart
in
her
breast
he
thought
could
i
not
meet
her
and
find
my
heaven
in
possessing
her
instead
of
caring
only
for
a
woman
who
has
no
more
passion
or
pity
than
those
mexican
aloes
as
he
walked
home
the
remembrance
of
nadine
napraxine
seemed
like
a
little
adder
growing
in
his
heart
and
the
large
eyes
of
yseulte
de
valogne
seemed
to
look
into
his
soul
with
their
golden
he
was
passionately
in
love
with
the
one
bitterly
angrily
resentfully
in
love
for
the
other
he
felt
an
extreme
pity
a
sympathy
which
with
propitious
circumstances
might
become
affection
an
admiration
of
the
senses
which
might
with
time
be
heightened
to
desire
an
inclination
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
save
her
from
her
fate
as
he
might
have
taken
up
a
wounded
bird
to
save
it
from
the
trap
chapter
xii
yseulte
the
next
day
was
sitting
writing
a
german
theme
in
the
children
room
of
which
the
windows
opened
on
the
gardens
when
alain
de
vannes
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
pushed
open
the
glass
door
and
sauntered
in
from
the
open
air
my
cousin
he
said
gaily
you
are
shut
up
like
a
little
mouse
what
nonsense
it
is
german
what
good
will
that
do
you
when
the
comes
we
shall
speak
with
bullets
and
they
will
understand
as
we
understood
pardieu
when
they
burnt
my
woods
in
charente
i
had
a
ball
in
my
ribs
at
saarbrück
did
you
know
it
where
were
you
in
paris
during
the
siege
a
baby
like
you
is
it
possible
were
many
other
little
children
there
said
the
girl
with
a
shudder
she
had
been
such
a
little
child
then
that
the
horror
of
the
time
had
left
an
ineffaceable
mark
upon
her
course
of
course
said
the
duc
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
not
many
of
your
rank
most
people
got
away
ah
to
be
sure
i
remember
your
uncles
de
creusac
were
both
shot
yes
we
all
lost
heavily
it
is
no
use
thinking
of
it
but
i
would
give
my
life
to
enter
berlin
this
is
not
what
i
came
to
say
but
you
make
one
serious
why
will
you
not
laugh
do
you
know
that
we
have
a
ball
next
week
heard
blanchette
saying
so
the
little
cat
she
knows
everything
now
this
ball
would
you
not
like
to
come
to
it
instead
of
being
shut
up
in
your
room
writing
crabbed
german
characters
is
impossible
while
she
said
the
cruel
word
firmly
her
heart
gave
a
great
leap
of
longing
that
was
almost
hope
impossible
perhaps
difficult
said
de
vannes
with
a
smile
as
he
threw
his
cigar
out
on
to
the
grass
i
think
i
could
persuade
it
is
a
shame
for
you
to
be
shut
up
you
will
have
enough
of
that
all
your
life
if
you
go
where
they
say
yseulte
was
silent
her
heart
was
still
beating
tumultuously
she
breathed
quickly
handsome
she
is
thought
the
duc
only
wants
that
flush
of
life
to
be
perfect
women
are
like
alabaster
lamps
unlit
until
they
learn
envy
and
desire
when
that
flame
is
lighted
then
the
alabaster
glows
he
stooped
his
head
and
kissed
her
hand
but
he
did
it
with
a
different
touch
to
othmar
and
she
coloured
with
a
sense
of
pain
and
anger
mie
he
murmured
will
undertake
to
combat
successfully
the
scruples
of
your
cousin
you
shall
see
the
ball
next
week
shall
find
you
a
frock
and
jewels
you
want
none
you
have
the
supreme
jewel
youth
crowns
are
dull
without
it
and
let
our
dear
women
use
what
arts
they
may
they
can
not
counterfeit
it
i
will
be
your
good
genius
yseulte
and
open
your
prison
doors
you
will
not
refuse
me
a
little
gratitude
a
little
goodwill
something
quite
simple
and
commonplace
will
content
me
you
see
but
you
must
give
it
bon
the
words
were
harmless
and
said
little
but
his
eyes
as
they
were
bent
upon
her
said
much
much
more
than
he
knew
there
was
a
look
in
them
which
lighted
their
pale
blue
with
a
fire
from
which
she
shrank
by
instinct
as
from
something
which
scorched
and
hurt
her
the
eyes
of
alain
de
vannes
like
those
of
most
men
who
have
lived
his
life
and
had
his
experiences
were
cold
jaded
passionless
in
repose
but
when
amorous
were
cruel
eager
rapacious
yseulte
drew
her
hand
from
him
her
heart
sank
five
fathoms
deep
but
she
gathered
up
all
her
courage
are
very
good
mon
she
said
with
a
ceremonious
coldness
worthy
of
one
twice
her
years
do
not
trouble
yourself
for
me
that
sort
of
pleasure
would
not
accord
with
the
life
that
i
am
always
to
lead
i
do
not
know
the
world
i
do
not
wish
to
know
it
it
is
never
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
it
is
better
i
should
not
even
see
it
i
might
only
regret
she
said
the
little
speech
bravely
not
faltering
once
though
to
make
it
cost
her
a
pang
but
she
crushed
out
all
her
natural
longings
all
her
wistful
instincts
all
her
youthful
dreams
to
do
so
flowers
plucked
up
by
the
roots
and
thrown
down
at
the
foot
of
the
altars
of
marie
but
even
at
this
moment
the
altar
still
seemed
to
her
that
which
she
had
been
always
told
that
it
was
a
refuge
sweet
safe
unfailing
a
refuge
from
what
she
did
not
know
but
a
vague
fear
had
assailed
her
de
vannes
looked
at
her
with
surprise
and
irritation
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
was
himself
ashamed
of
the
unholy
wishes
which
had
awakened
in
him
of
the
treacherous
temptations
which
he
had
begun
to
put
in
the
path
of
a
girl
who
was
his
own
guest
his
wife
relative
and
whose
position
ought
in
its
sheer
defencelessness
to
have
been
her
best
safeguard
with
any
man
of
honour
he
was
not
without
honour
in
a
loose
fashion
but
he
was
very
unscrupulous
when
his
fancy
was
excited
if
before
her
retirement
to
the
religious
life
she
should
have
an
and
if
that
should
have
himself
for
its
hero
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
anything
terrible
would
have
taken
place
what
was
the
use
of
occupying
a
high
position
if
one
could
not
successfully
conduct
and
cover
a
little
intrigue
like
that
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
his
designs
would
scarcely
be
condoned
even
by
the
very
set
amongst
which
he
lived
if
it
were
seriously
known
that
he
endeavoured
to
be
the
first
to
corrupt
his
young
cousin
therefore
her
words
struck
a
certain
nerve
of
susceptibility
within
him
he
felt
a
kind
of
compunction
before
that
serious
and
guileless
regard
yet
he
was
very
angry
he
alain
de
vannes
who
never
looked
at
a
who
never
deigned
to
notice
any
lesser
thing
than
some
of
the
famous
beauties
of
the
great
world
or
of
the
had
taken
the
infinite
trouble
to
distinguish
this
child
to
seek
her
and
to
offer
her
his
influence
and
protection
and
she
had
repulsed
him
with
her
hands
lying
crossed
on
her
german
books
and
her
cheeks
growing
neither
the
warmer
nor
the
colder
for
his
regard
he
rose
and
his
eyebrows
contracted
in
a
heavy
frown
he
was
a
man
usually
but
in
such
rare
times
as
his
will
was
crossed
he
had
the
petulance
and
the
malice
of
a
spoiled
child
are
not
wise
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
would
be
a
good
friend
to
you
and
you
may
want
one
before
you
are
safe
in
the
bosom
of
our
lady
i
wonder
the
ball
did
not
tempt
you
you
would
have
seen
your
friend
othmar
and
madame
napraxine
then
he
pulled
the
glass
door
open
with
an
impatient
hand
and
went
out
into
the
grounds
without
leaving
behind
him
the
odour
of
his
cigarette
and
the
sting
of
his
last
words
blanchette
peeped
in
from
behind
a
silk
curtain
her
saucy
babyish
eyes
were
full
of
curiosity
and
wonder
yseulte
she
said
running
up
to
her
cousin
heard
all
papa
said
why
should
he
want
you
at
the
ball
and
why
should
you
not
go
you
are
a
goose
such
a
goose
you
know
papa
can
always
make
mamma
do
what
he
chooses
he
always
threatens
to
send
away
de
prangins
then
blanchette
laughed
curling
herself
up
in
a
little
ball
at
her
cousin
feet
should
not
say
such
wicked
things
blanchette
said
yseulte
it
is
very
shameful
and
dishonourable
to
listen
anywhere
unseen
blanchette
made
a
de
with
her
little
rosy
fingers
with
all
the
mockery
and
insolence
of
gavrôche
himself
are
vulgar
as
well
as
wicked
said
her
cousin
sadly
as
she
looked
away
is
distinguished
to
be
vulgar
now
said
the
little
parisienne
the
great
ladies
are
except
madame
napraxine
she
is
always
wrapped
up
in
herself
she
has
no
she
cares
for
nothing
she
is
not
at
all
my
model
listen
if
you
were
not
such
an
idiot
you
would
see
that
is
in
love
with
you
ever
so
much
in
love
why
do
you
get
all
kinds
of
things
out
of
him
while
he
is
in
the
humour
he
would
buy
you
all
the
palais
royal
if
you
knew
how
to
manage
him
and
mamma
will
not
say
anything
as
long
as
the
marquis
raymond
is
here
cried
the
girl
indignantly
she
rose
to
her
feet
a
flood
of
shame
seemed
to
roll
over
her
the
insolent
malicious
turquoise
eyes
of
blanchette
amused
themselves
with
her
horror
and
trouble
are
such
a
baby
said
the
child
again
contemptuously
never
seem
to
understand
anything
me
i
understand
it
all
i
shall
it
all
when
i
am
married
i
shall
be
just
like
mamma
it
is
the
marquis
raymond
now
it
was
the
prince
jacques
last
year
i
liked
the
prince
jacques
best
he
gave
me
an
orchestra
of
monkeys
you
wound
it
up
and
all
the
monkeys
played
fife
drum
clarionet
flute
the
marquis
has
never
given
me
anything
except
a
sack
of
bonbons
he
might
have
bought
at
st
cloud
if
he
do
not
give
me
something
very
good
at
new
year
i
shall
say
out
loud
in
the
salon
when
a
lot
of
people
are
making
visits
you
are
not
as
nice
as
prince
jacques
and
how
he
will
look
because
he
always
frets
and
fumes
about
the
prince
i
think
they
fought
about
mamma
oh
it
must
be
such
fun
to
be
a
woman
i
wish
i
wish
i
wish
i
were
fifteen
i
would
be
so
naughty
they
would
have
to
marry
me
if
you
were
not
a
goose
you
would
be
as
naughty
as
ever
you
could
be
they
would
get
you
a
husband
then
papa
would
see
to
it
cried
yseulte
again
in
desperation
not
knowing
how
to
stem
the
tide
of
the
child
words
she
like
blanchette
herself
was
ignorant
of
all
the
horrible
import
of
those
words
which
the
little
thing
used
half
in
malicious
precocious
knowledge
and
half
in
absolute
childish
ignorance
but
they
terrified
her
and
appalled
her
both
in
themselves
and
for
their
speaker
and
for
all
which
even
to
her
innocence
they
suggested
of
unspeakable
inconceivable
shamefulness
echoed
the
child
mimicking
the
horror
and
expostulation
of
her
cry
how
glad
i
am
i
have
schemmitz
and
brawn
to
teach
me
instead
of
going
to
a
convent
to
be
made
a
goose
of
like
you
schemmitz
and
brawn
are
old
owls
but
i
keep
my
eyes
and
my
ears
open
at
trouville
at
biarritz
in
paris
here
anywhere
everywhere
now
in
your
nunnery
you
see
no
more
you
hear
no
more
than
if
you
were
a
statue
in
a
chapel
that
is
why
you
are
so
stupid
why
did
papa
call
count
othmar
your
friend
is
he
your
friend
you
are
as
still
as
a
mouse
about
everything
her
quick
glance
saw
the
colour
mount
into
her
cousin
face
and
the
cruel
child
laughed
triumphantly
how
you
blush
nobody
blushes
one
must
be
like
you
to
be
so
silly
shall
never
blush
yseulte
tell
me
all
about
it
and
i
will
not
tell
toinon
is
nothing
to
tell
said
yseulte
almost
losing
her
patience
never
says
anything
without
meaning
something
by
it
said
blanchette
sagaciously
if
there
be
nothing
why
should
you
blush
i
know
all
about
count
othmar
he
is
rich
oh
so
rich
nobody
was
ever
so
rich
outside
the
i
heard
them
say
so
this
autumn
at
aix
but
all
he
cares
about
is
princess
napraxine
have
you
ever
seen
princess
napraxine
she
drives
in
the
bois
with
three
horses
in
the
russian
way
the
one
in
the
middle
is
a
little
in
front
of
the
others
and
they
have
only
little
bits
of
silver
for
harness
and
they
fly
ouf
i
mean
to
marry
a
russian
she
so
very
beautiful
said
yseulte
in
a
low
tone
ashamed
of
questioning
the
child
and
yet
impelled
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
hear
more
of
this
wondrous
sovereign
tant
que
ça
said
blanchette
critically
she
is
much
more
than
only
handsome
she
makes
every
one
that
goes
near
her
mad
about
her
she
is
pale
and
has
great
eyes
but
there
is
no
one
like
her
they
say
what
do
you
think
they
call
her
they
call
her
flocon
de
neige
she
cares
for
nobody
you
know
that
is
what
they
mean
she
is
not
at
all
what
i
admire
what
i
admire
is
the
duchesse
sait
se
faire
une
tête
continued
blanchette
growing
breathless
and
powerless
to
express
her
immense
admiration
madame
was
a
blonde
with
a
profusion
of
real
gold
curls
cheeks
admirably
tinted
and
a
tiny
cupid
bow
of
a
mouth
a
great
huntress
a
great
swimmer
a
great
smoker
she
had
very
extravagant
toilettes
and
very
loud
manners
and
was
a
really
great
lady
with
the
language
of
a
cantinière
she
was
the
object
of
the
idolatry
will
be
just
like
that
blanchette
said
to
herself
whenever
she
saw
madame
walking
on
the
planks
at
trouville
going
into
the
casino
at
aix
or
driving
her
piebald
ponies
round
the
bois
blanchette
admired
her
own
mother
immensely
but
she
admired
the
duchesse
still
more
baisse
un
she
often
said
to
her
sister
with
a
little
scornful
smile
she
knew
that
her
mother
was
to
blanchette
that
age
seemed
to
be
quite
hopeless
decrepitude
she
said
suddenly
now
you
do
not
give
me
your
silver
i
shall
tell
mamma
about
you
and
papa
donc
sois
give
me
the
silver
hours
the
silver
had
belonged
to
a
marquise
de
creusac
in
the
time
of
louis
treize
it
was
adorned
with
illuminated
letters
and
the
coronet
and
initials
were
set
in
opals
on
one
side
of
the
silver
cover
yseulte
had
been
given
the
book
by
her
grandmother
on
her
she
used
it
always
and
it
was
the
object
of
desires
know
that
i
can
not
give
it
you
said
yseulte
gently
was
my
grandmother
last
gift
it
is
an
heirloom
blanchette
looked
up
from
under
her
yellow
hair
had
better
give
it
me
sage
she
had
the
same
expression
half
menace
half
malice
that
her
father
had
had
can
not
repeated
her
cousin
have
told
you
so
dear
a
hundred
times
i
should
not
have
a
moment
peace
if
i
parted
with
that
book
blanchette
said
nothing
more
but
she
made
a
wheel
of
herself
on
the
floor
as
she
had
seen
the
boys
do
on
the
pavement
in
paris
on
est
bête
comme
on
est
bête
she
kept
thinking
in
her
shrewd
little
mind
as
she
stood
on
her
wise
little
skull
with
all
the
dexterity
of
any
blanchette
at
ten
years
old
had
already
resolved
the
problem
of
life
with
great
simplicity
its
solution
seemed
to
her
to
consist
in
getting
whatever
you
wanted
by
being
detestable
whenever
you
did
not
get
it
on
the
night
of
the
ball
when
the
first
carriages
rolled
up
to
the
of
millo
yseulte
who
had
gone
to
bed
at
ten
but
had
not
slept
rose
and
went
to
her
window
which
looked
on
the
front
of
the
house
the
illuminations
of
the
building
and
of
the
grounds
were
so
brilliant
that
the
light
was
almost
as
strong
as
day
the
awnings
hid
from
her
sight
the
steps
at
which
the
arriving
guests
descended
but
she
could
see
the
carriages
as
they
came
up
toward
them
and
she
could
hear
the
suisse
bawl
out
the
names
of
those
who
arrived
one
after
another
amongst
them
some
of
the
greatest
names
of
europe
at
twelve
she
heard
the
name
of
othmar
but
she
had
not
seen
him
for
the
blinds
of
his
brougham
were
down
an
hour
and
a
half
later
almost
the
last
of
the
apparently
endless
succession
of
champing
horses
and
coupés
she
saw
one
carriage
of
which
the
window
next
her
was
lowered
as
it
drove
up
she
could
see
within
it
a
very
lovely
woman
with
a
little
tiara
of
diamonds
on
her
head
and
a
great
bouquet
made
entirely
of
gardenias
in
her
hand
and
a
cloak
of
gold
tissue
lined
with
ermine
drawn
up
as
high
as
her
mouth
the
lady
profile
delicate
as
if
it
were
cut
in
ivory
with
something
satirical
and
mutinous
in
its
expression
was
all
that
yseulte
could
see
of
her
but
she
felt
that
in
that
moment
she
had
looked
on
the
princess
napraxine
in
effect
as
the
carriage
rolled
beneath
the
awning
the
sonorous
muscovite
name
was
shouted
by
the
waiting
lackeys
the
girl
withdrew
from
the
casement
and
shut
the
shutters
she
did
not
want
to
see
any
more
she
lay
down
again
but
she
did
not
sleep
the
sound
of
dance
music
played
by
the
band
of
the
echoed
through
all
the
villa
which
was
a
light
modern
structure
and
had
little
solidity
in
it
she
did
not
care
for
the
dancing
she
hardly
knew
what
it
was
like
but
she
thought
of
the
lovely
woman
with
the
pretty
contemptuous
profile
and
the
diamonds
and
the
gardenias
in
her
hair
she
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
her
she
was
there
below
in
the
light
amidst
the
music
and
the
flowers
and
othmar
was
there
too
the
visitants
which
alain
de
vannes
had
wished
should
go
to
her
envy
and
regret
entered
her
innocent
soul
and
made
sad
ravages
there
as
when
a
rat
runs
amidst
a
white
rose
and
pulls
its
blossoms
down
sleep
kept
aloof
from
her
she
was
ashamed
of
her
own
thoughts
but
the
dawn
found
her
with
hot
eyes
the
music
was
still
sounding
like
a
tireless
immortal
thing
that
shouted
and
laughed
for
its
pleasure
it
was
only
the
first
notes
of
the
cotillon
but
to
yseulte
it
sounded
like
the
song
of
triumph
of
the
world
that
world
which
she
would
never
know
all
her
nuns
and
priests
could
not
perhaps
have
read
her
a
sounder
homily
than
the
house
mutely
spoke
when
she
went
timidly
downstairs
and
through
its
many
rooms
at
sunrise
the
flowers
covering
the
balustrades
and
walls
of
the
staircase
were
dying
the
sleepy
servants
were
turning
out
the
gas
putting
out
the
wax
candles
other
servants
were
drinking
champagne
and
smoking
cigars
as
they
hurried
to
clear
away
the
supper
tables
in
the
there
was
a
litter
of
dropped
flowers
torn
lace
discarded
cotillon
toys
atoms
of
fringe
and
of
ribbon
which
looked
scarcely
better
than
rags
the
torches
were
still
flaming
amongst
the
scorched
clusters
of
azaleas
and
roses
in
the
vestibule
two
gentlemen
who
had
stayed
to
drink
some
black
coffee
were
putting
on
their
furs
and
yawning
miserably
alain
de
vannes
as
he
sauntered
upstairs
was
muttering
crevant
un
bal
chez
soi
on
ne
me
reprendra
jamais
and
a
maid
of
his
wife
was
recounting
her
griefs
to
a
tall
powdered
lackey
with
sobs
of
rage

napraxine
meanwhile
rolled
home
in
the
pale
light
of
the
winter
morning
which
had
dawned
over
a
quiet
sea
and
a
peaceful
country
she
was
neither
fatigued
nor
exhilarated
by
a
ball
which
had
been
one
of
those
long
triumphs
to
which
she
was
so
well
used
she
looked
as
calm
as
cool
as
delicate
of
hue
as
any
lenten
lily
that
opens
between
the
snow
and
the
moss
on
an
april
morning
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
can
go
through
incredible
fatigue
whether
of
pleasure
or
of
travel
without
any
personal
traces
of
it
whilst
her
companion
lady
brancepeth
nodded
and
slumbered
she
looked
out
at
the
landscape
over
which
the
sun
was
slowly
dawning
driving
before
its
rays
the
white
mists
which
stretched
over
sea
and
mountain
there
were
people
moving
in
it
women
came
down
the
steep
stone
ladders
of
their
fields
bearing
heavy
loads
of
oranges
or
of
vegetables
mule
carts
plodded
along
the
paths
fishermen
were
pushing
boats
into
deep
water
church
bells
were
ringing
she
with
her
delicate
and
acute
perception
of
what
was
beautiful
found
pleasure
in
watching
the
simple
hardy
figures
which
were
seen
for
a
moment
and
then
disappeared
beneath
the
mist
in
hearing
the
bells
answer
one
another
ringing
across
the
white
clouds
that
were
touching
the
earth
does
it
feel
like
she
wondered
sleep
sound
all
night
on
a
bit
of
sacking
and
get
up
in
the
dusk
and
go
into
the
wet
fields
and
labour
what
do
these
people
think
about
what
do
sheep
think
about
or
oxen
it
must
be
much
the
same
thing
wilkes
what
do
think
about
you
have
got
ever
so
many
at
home
you
ought
to
know
lady
brancepeth
felt
cross
at
being
aroused
and
cross
at
having
been
asleep
about
she
murmured
i
do
know
beer
i
believe
with
us
beer
and
bacon
here
i
should
say
francs
nothing
but
francs
probably
what
put
them
in
your
head
and
there
are
no
labourers
here
in
our
sense
of
the
word
you
know
it
is
most
of
it
petite
you
know
i
never
believe
it
is
good
for
the
soil
certainly
not
in
the
long
run
it
ca
be
they
get
everything
out
they
put
nothing
in
of
course
they
think
only
of
the
market
of
the
day
they
do
think
of
the
future
those
people
that
will
be
always
the
upshot
of
peasant
proprietors
they
will
always
ruin
the
soil
nadine
napraxine
laughed
a
fine
thing
it
is
to
be
an
englishwoman
you
think
of
political
economy
and
of
soil
the
very
moment
that
you
wake
out
of
a
doze
i
suppose
the
earth
will
certainly
last
our
time
what
does
the
rest
matter
are
so
so
so
egotistic
and
autocratic
nadine
the
princess
laughed
i
do
know
i
do
think
so
i
like
a
despotism
i
was
born
under
it
it
saves
so
much
trouble
and
one
big
despot
is
very
much
easier
to
deal
with
than
a
score
of
little
ones
especially
when
you
stand
well
at
his
court
it
is
always
better
to
be
judged
by
a
judge
instead
of
a
jury
but
simpletons
will
not
see
that
how
can
one
judge
however
just
rightfully
judge
a
nation
of
millions
unless
he
have
the
eyes
and
ears
of
vishnou
i
think
you
really
are
a
despot
by
nature
but
you
are
so
very
disputatious
that
you
are
always
ready
to
repudiate
your
most
cherished
opinions
for
sheer
sake
of
argument
you
should
have
been
a
sophist
question
is
polygonal
look
at
that
gleam
of
light
on
that
sail
and
all
the
rest
of
the
vessel
lost
in
fog
how
charming
it
is
like
a
picture
of
aïvanoffsky
that
is
what
i
like
in
life
nothing
said
out
nothing
broadly
and
rudely
done
everything
demi
everything
suggestion
not
assertion
that
is
the
only
way
to
exhaust
nothing
not
to
be
wearied
like
impressions
not
pictures
that
is
the
new
school
everyone
is
not
satisfied
with
it
that
there
are
people
to
whom
these
vague
wavy
lines
those
dim
washes
of
colour
tell
little
the
people
to
whom
one
must
explain
let
them
all
go
where
the
sheep
of
panurge
went
wish
you
would
condescend
for
once
to
explain
something
said
lady
brancepeth
and
paused
princess
nadine
heard
with
a
look
of
infinite
mean
to
revenge
yourself
for
having
been
awakened
out
of
that
dose
i
never
explain
tell
me
what
you
want
under
this
slight
encouragement
lady
brancepeth
gained
courage
to
plunge
straightway
into
a
question
which
she
had
long
meditated
you
tell
me
my
dear
nadine
what
you
mean
to
do
with
my
brother
madame
napraxine
turned
a
little
round
in
her
ermine
and
gold
brocade
and
looked
solemnly
in
her
companion
face
dear
evelyn
you
amaze
me
do
with
him
i
with
your
brother
with
lord
geraldine
what
should
i
do
with
him
do
you
want
me
to
make
a
good
marriage
for
him
but
you
are
there
to
preside
over
that
and
besides
he
will
make
one
himself
some
day
seriously
for
a
moment
said
lady
brancepeth
with
impatience
are
very
clever
and
are
fond
of
i
am
a
blunt
stupid
woman
and
so
i
like
plain
ones
it
is
two
years
since
geraldine
has
had
any
other
thought
than
yourself
when
will
you
be
merciful
and
unmagnetise
him
that
depend
on
me
said
the
princess
nadine
with
a
little
laugh
you
want
me
to
make
a
few
passes
in
the
air
with
my
hand
i
can
do
it
if
you
wish
but
i
doubt
the
result
lady
brancepeth
made
an
impatient
movement
ralph
is
only
one
amongst
many
i
know
my
dear
but
for
that
very
reason
surely
you
might
spare
him
you
do
not
care
the
least
little
atom
about
him
least
little
i
am
a
russian
but
i
do
know
that
is
not
good
english
i
speak
better
english
than
you
do
do
everything
admirably
well
you
are
the
most
intelligent
as
you
are
the
most
interesting
woman
that
i
know
but
you
are
also
the
most
heartless
answered
lady
brancepeth
with
some
heat
am
not
a
prude
i
can
understand
temptation
and
the
weakness
that
cedes
to
it
i
can
understand
love
and
the
force
that
it
may
exercise
and
i
can
forgive
even
its
follies
but
your
kind
of
coquetry
i
can
not
forgive
it
is
the
exercise
of
a
merciless
power
which
is
as
chill
as
a
vivisector
attitude
before
his
victim
you
have
no
sympathy
or
compassion
you
have
only
a
sort
of
cynical
amusement
in
what
you
do
you
make
yourself
the
centre
of
a
man
life
with
no
more
effort
than
you
use
that
fan
the
man
is
nothing
to
you
nothing
on
earth
but
you
destroy
all
his
peace
all
his
future
wilkes
do
not
be
so
tragic
murmured
princess
napraxine
with
a
little
yawn
dislike
tragedy
i
never
by
any
chance
go
to
perrin
when
they
play
one
if
men
are
fond
of
me
as
you
say
i
say
ejaculated
lady
brancepeth
you
say
it
is
merely
because
as
you
wisely
if
ungrammatically
observed
it
is
because
i
do
not
care
the
least
little
atom
about
any
one
of
them
i
should
have
exceedingly
liked
to
care
for
platon
it
would
have
been
something
new
it
would
have
agreed
with
my
programme
of
life
it
would
have
suited
me
in
every
way
but
pas
qui
who
care
for
platon
does
anybody
ever
care
for
a
very
big
and
entirely
uninteresting
person
who
drinks
brandy
and
grows
bald
beg
my
question
retorted
lady
brancepeth
know
very
well
that
i
am
not
talking
of
your
husband
you
ought
to
be
if
you
be
not
you
are
a
very
immoral
woman
to
recommend
me
to
care
for
anybody
else
said
the
princess
with
her
soft
quiet
little
laugh
that
was
as
pretty
as
the
coo
of
a
wood
dove
but
by
no
means
so
harmless
would
exasperate
a
saint
cried
her
companion
never
met
one
said
nadine
nearest
approach
to
one
that
i
know
is
melville
and
i
can
put
out
of
temper
have
no
doubt
you
can
said
lady
brancepeth
think
you
would
anyone
you
do
such
immeasurable
harm
and
are
all
the
while
as
demure
as
a
rabbit
and
as
my
dear
princess
you
are
the
cruellest
woman
that
lives
flocon
de
neige
they
call
you
they
might
much
more
appropriately
call
you
goutte
de
morphine
you
enervate
and
you
kill
and
all
the
while
what
do
you
care
you
care
no
more
than
the
morphia
does
the
ball
bore
you
too
so
dreadfully
that
you
are
so
very
unkind
a
rabbit
and
morphia
your
similes
are
mixed
my
dear
i
am
never
a
flirt
a
flirt
is
a
very
vulgar
thing
no
man
lives
i
can
assure
you
who
could
say
he
ever
had
a
word
of
encouragement
from
me
that
is
not
at
all
my
way
said
lady
brancepeth
bitterly
way
is
merely
to
look
at
men
and
destroy
them
and
then
laugh
a
little
when
they
are
spoken
of
i
never
reproached
you
with
ordinary
coquetry
i
reproach
you
with
something
much
more
subtle
arrogant
cold
and
cruel
there
is
a
gum
of
the
east
advertised
which
does
not
kill
flies
only
attracts
them
so
that
they
cling
to
it
by
millions
and
hang
there
stupidly
in
a
throng
till
they
die
that
gum
is
very
like
your
power
over
your
lovers
it
is
just
as
passive
just
as
deadly
gum
and
i
were
made
as
we
are
by
nature
blame
nature
the
men
and
the
flies
would
do
worse
if
they
did
not
do
that
and
pray
do
not
talk
about
my
lovers
i
have
none
have
no
serfs
in
russia
but
you
have
moujiks
and
it
is
still
much
the
same
thing
as
far
as
their
submission
goes
are
really
too
sarcastic
wilkes
was
champagne
bad
surely
not
but
there
must
be
something
you
have
not
digested
perhaps
it
is
the
caviare
sandwiches
here
we
are
at
home
do
go
to
bed
and
dream
of
your
gum
your
rabbit
and
your
bottle
of
morphine
none
of
these
things
can
swim
but
i
who
am
a
combination
of
them
can
and
i
shall
be
swimming
under
your
window
whilst
you
sleep
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
of
la
jacquemerille
and
she
descended
aided
by
geraldine
who
with
her
husband
had
arrived
a
few
minutes
earlier
lady
brancepeth
hurried
indoors
conscious
with
the
consciousness
of
years
that
the
morning
light
was
not
becoming
after
a
ball
nadine
napraxine
with
the
equally
conscious
immunity
of
an
exquisite
complexion
and
of
that
kind
of
beauty
which
is
like
a
unwound
the
lace
from
about
her
delicate
head
and
paused
in
the
doorway
looking
seaward
shall
not
go
to
bed
she
said
as
the
rays
of
the
sunrise
touched
the
gilded
pinnacles
and
vanes
of
la
jacquemerille
shall
go
and
get
into
a
peignoir
then
breakfast
and
then
bathe
it
is
so
stupid
to
go
to
bed
when
the
sun
is
up
platon
you
look
like
a
bear
awaked
before
he
has
done
hybernating
did
you
not
get
sleep
enough
in
de
vannes
never
get
sleep
enough
replied
napraxine
but
drowsily
you
do
a
very
foolish
thing
if
you
stand
there
princess
in
a
frost
at
seven
after
five
hours
of
the
cotillon
is
no
frost
look
at
the
geraniums
and
i
never
take
cold
that
is
not
my
malady
at
all
i
am
not
so
silly
napraxine
opened
his
sleepy
eyes
you
can
not
live
in
russia
because
the
tubercles
on
your
lungs
thiviers
is
responsible
for
the
tubercles
one
is
obliged
to
say
something
civil
to
get
away
from
a
court
it
is
always
safe
to
say
one
suffers
with
one
lungs
nobody
can
ask
to
look
at
them
pray
go
to
bed
and
dream
of
nirvana
if
you
know
what
it
means
the
prince
obeyed
and
disappeared
yawning
geraldine
remained
gazing
at
this
elegant
figure
on
the
marble
step
with
its
du
of
ermine
and
gold
silk
folded
about
it
and
the
face
with
its
hue
of
a
white
which
could
defy
so
surely
the
searching
morning
light
she
glanced
at
him
in
return
and
laughed
droll
you
look
with
your
and
your
ulster
you
are
not
harmonious
with
the
landscape
my
friend
and
you
look
sulky
the
ball
seems
to
have
disagreed
with
all
of
you
yet
it
was
a
very
good
ball
as
balls
go
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
variety
to
a
ball
balls
and
funerals
se
ressemble
she
drew
the
ermine
over
her
pretty
chin
the
diamonds
sparkled
in
her
hair
the
bouquet
of
gardenias
swung
in
her
hand
the
eyes
of
geraldine
grew
very
sombre
and
covetous
am
sorry
i
am
a
blot
on
the
scene
he
said
moodily
are
always
unpicturesque
i
stood
still
and
gazed
at
you
all
night
but
no
doubt
i
only
looked
like
a
policeman
or
a
fool
both
she
murmured
with
a
smile
he
continued
unheedingly
your
friend
othmar
who
did
precisely
the
same
thing
looked
of
course
to
you
and
to
everybody
like
a
titian
resuscitated
is
not
especially
like
any
titian
that
i
have
ever
seen
said
madame
napraxine
he
knows
how
to
stand
with
grace
which
no
englishman
ever
did
know
yet
you
are
quite
right
your
people
do
not
compose
well
except
when
they
are
in
the
or
playing
some
very
rough
game
but
you
need
not
for
compliments
you
are
very
in
your
way
muttered
geraldine
in
a
tone
which
would
have
better
suited
an
imprecation
othmar
had
not
danced
once
with
her
he
had
indeed
only
moved
reluctantly
through
a
with
his
hostess
but
the
unerring
instinct
of
jealousy
made
the
envy
of
geraldine
fasten
on
him
rather
than
on
any
other
of
the
crowd
for
whom
the
ball
at
millo
had
only
meant
princess
napraxine
is
a
little
chilly
said
the
princess
as
she
turned
from
the
open
door
geraldine
caught
her
hand
which
held
the
fan
you
would
but
believe
all
that
your
life
is
to
us
you
would
not
run
such
mad
risks
as
this
raw
cold
fog
after
a
ball
had
i
been
platon
i
would
have
carried
you
to
your
room
by
main
force
the
face
of
nadine
napraxine
grew
very
cold
are
not
prince
napraxine
happily
for
myself
and
yourself
and
i
do
not
like
impertinences
go
and
smoke
and
recover
your
good
manners
were
kinder
to
me
before
othmar
came
home
said
geraldine
with
injudicious
reproach
have
bad
manners
said
the
princess
calmly
as
she
gathered
up
her
ermine
and
drew
her
train
over
the
little
hall
and
up
the
staircase
she
smiled
as
she
passed
upward
babyish
they
all
are
she
reflected
if
to
complain
of
another
man
were
not
the
very
way
to
cement
a
woman
preference
for
him
if
she
had
any
preference
that
poor
boy
has
no
tact
if
his
sister
had
not
said
anything
about
him
i
would
send
him
away
he
is
a
bore
to
be
sure
he
is
here
to
take
platon
off
one
hands
and
smoke
with
him
all
men
are
tiresome
when
you
have
known
them
a
month
or
so
all
human
beings
are
tiresome
nobody
ever
tires
of
me
and
i
tire
of
everybody
perhaps
she
remembered
that
othmar
had
alone
never
tired
her
he
had
been
too
romantic
too
presuming
too
prone
to
fancy
he
had
rights
and
wrongs
but
he
had
never
wearied
her
most
men
were
so
absurd
when
they
were
enamoured
of
her
but
he
was
not
so
a
little
too
like
ruy
blas
perhaps
a
little
too
inclined
to
be
serious
and
impassioned
to
the
in
a
word
but
still
he
had
kept
his
grace
and
kept
his
dignity
he
kept
them
still
he
would
not
let
her
play
with
him
she
was
the
one
woman
on
earth
for
him
but
he
did
not
become
her
slave
she
had
her
bath
and
wrapped
herself
in
a
loose
gown
of
satin
and
lace
and
went
out
into
the
garden
with
a
hood
over
her
head
it
was
certainly
cold
and
the
mists
had
not
altogether
cleared
but
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
her
to
do
what
her
physician
and
her
friends
denounced
as
most
dangerous
is
snoring
she
thought
contemptuously
as
she
glanced
over
the
closed
shutters
i
dare
say
geraldine
snores
too
if
one
only
knew
i
dare
say
they
both
took
soda
and
brandy
men
are
certainly
unlovely
creatures
as
long
as
we
are
young
we
are
a
little
better
than
they
we
look
pretty
asleep
and
we
do
snore
how
poor
was
last
night
and
then
she
really
throws
her
heart
into
the
affair
with
de
prangins
nothing
ever
ages
a
woman
like
that
and
i
am
quite
sure
he
does
not
care
a
straw
about
her
she
walked
up
and
down
her
terrace
trailing
her
skirts
over
the
marble
she
was
a
little
sleepy
a
little
bored
but
she
wished
to
show
to
her
friends
that
she
could
dance
all
night
and
breakfast
out
of
doors
without
more
fatigue
than
a
nightingale
after
singing
all
night
feels
as
he
trips
across
the
grass
at
sunrise
she
thought
with
a
little
amusement
that
if
geraldine
were
really
as
wasting
with
despair
as
he
professed
to
be
he
would
have
been
out
of
bed
still
on
the
mere
chance
of
her
reappearance
the
various
degrees
of
passions
in
her
lovers
diverted
her
she
had
no
vanity
she
could
dissect
and
weigh
their
emotions
with
perfect
accuracy
and
philosophise
upon
them
with
a
clearness
of
understanding
wholly
beyond
the
reach
of
vain
woman
analysis
diverted
her
much
more
than
conquest
some
had
loved
her
tragically
some
had
died
through
her
if
not
for
her
she
had
had
genuine
triumphs
great
enough
and
costly
enough
to
satisfy
the
pride
of
anyone
therefore
she
could
amuse
herself
very
well
with
the
contradiction
when
somebody
who
declared
that
he
only
lived
for
her
nevertheless
drank
his
claret
with
relish
or
somebody
else
who
was
for
ever
at
her
feet
nevertheless
ceased
not
to
be
critical
of
his
cigars
othmar
she
thought
now
would
stay
sleepless
in
the
street
all
night
on
the
chance
of
seeing
my
shadow
on
a
window
blind
that
was
the
romanticism
which
did
not
suit
their
world
which
even
made
her
impatient
of
it
as
indifferent
people
are
always
impatient
of
earnestness
but
it
was
fine
after
all
finer
than
geraldine
sulkiness
which
let
him
go
to
sleep
the
air
was
very
cold
but
the
morning
was
fair
and
the
mists
were
lifting
higher
and
higher
every
moment
as
her
skirts
brushed
the
bay
hedge
it
gave
forth
a
sweet
odour
snowdrops
and
hepatica
blossomed
under
the
big
aloes
and
ground
ivy
was
green
about
the
stems
of
the
palms
the
mountains
grew
the
hue
of
summer
roses
under
the
approach
then
paled
into
amethyst
and
pearly
grey
it
was
intensely
quiet
there
was
no
sound
but
of
some
unseen
gardener
sweeping
up
dead
leaves
the
yellow
wings
of
an
oriole
flashed
among
the
glossy
leaves
of
a
pitosperum
world
looks
as
if
god
washed
it
clean
every
morning
she
thought
gets
soiled
before
noon
decidedly
it
is
only
the
birds
who
are
innocent
enough
for
the
sunrise
the
latent
sadness
of
the
russian
character
was
in
her
beneath
her
and
her
pessimism
and
her
irony
sometimes
she
wished
she
had
not
been
born
to
that
world
in
which
she
lived
where
there
is
no
pause
for
reflection
but
only
a
continuous
succession
of
spectacles
excitations
revelries
where
no
one
is
ever
alone
where
no
one
has
ever
time
to
note
a
wild
flower
grow
or
a
sun
sink
to
the
west
where
the
babble
of
society
is
for
ever
on
the
ear
and
nature
has
no
place
at
all
except
as
a
de
of
which
no
one
thinks
more
than
the
actor
thinks
of
the
painted
canvas
behind
him
with
its
bridge
or
its
garden
or
its
windmill
do
believe
i
should
have
liked
to
have
been
a
poor
woman
and
have
married
such
a
man
as
millet
or
corot
she
thought
to
herself
now
as
she
walked
along
the
alley
of
bay
that
ran
parallel
with
the
sea
then
she
laughed
at
the
idea
of
herself
living
in
a
cottage
in
a
french
wood
without
any
lace
without
any
diamonds
without
any
toilettes
looking
for
a
dusty
footsore
artist
coming
home
through
the
trees
to
his
au
somehow
the
artist
in
her
fancy
had
the
features
of
othmar
of
othmar
who
was
a
prince
of
the
bourses
and
could
no
more
escape
the
world
than
she
could
it
scarcely
surprised
her
when
she
saw
him
in
person
as
though
her
thoughts
had
compelled
him
to
come
thither
he
was
alone
in
a
little
boat
which
drifted
slowly
past
the
of
la
jacquemerille
his
hands
rested
idly
on
the
oars
and
his
eyes
were
looking
upward
at
the
house
she
leaned
down
through
one
of
the
openings
of
the
wall
of
clipt
bay
and
thrust
her
rose
satin
hood
over
the
water
it
you
othmar
she
said
to
him
are
you
doing
on
the
sea
at
eight
how
astonished
you
look
do
you
wonder
what
i
am
doing
in
the
open
air
they
are
all
asleep
comfortably
though
they
think
i
am
courting
death
row
to
the
stairs
you
can
breakfast
with
me
he
hesitated
looking
up
at
her
with
his
head
uncovered
and
his
eyes
dazzled
by
the
delicate
face
that
was
peering
forth
from
the
framework
of
bay
boughs
said
madame
napraxine
her
voice
could
be
very
imperious
and
was
so
now
he
obeyed
in
silence
passed
to
the
a
hundred
yards
farther
down
and
in
five
minutes
time
approached
her
under
the
arched
roof
of
the
bay
charmille
you
were
only
back
from
the
ball
an
hour
or
less
he
said
as
he
bowed
before
her
was
not
inclined
to
go
to
bed
the
morning
is
fine
you
are
up
betimes
too
when
did
you
leave
millo
left
when
you
did
said
othmar
with
significance
in
the
brevity
of
the
reply
you
can
not
have
breakfasted
either
you
will
breakfast
with
me
i
was
just
going
back
to
the
house
it
was
precisely
the
sort
of
de
which
would
amuse
her
her
husband
and
geraldine
lounging
downstairs
late
cross
and
easily
ruffled
to
find
her
alone
with
their
neighbour
from
pharamond
it
was
one
of
those
amusing
little
incidents
which
providence
who
she
was
sure
was
kind
to
her
was
always
sending
her
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
human
life
were
you
doing
under
the
sea
wall
she
pursued
it
your
habit
too
never
to
go
to
bed
you
must
have
been
rowing
some
time
we
are
two
sea
leagues
at
least
from
your
place
what
did
you
think
of
ball
that
new
figure
with
the
coloured
hoops
was
pretty
but
the
duc
leads
a
cotillon
better
than
anyone
said
othmar
saw
you
with
the
coloured
hoops
you
made
them
look
as
if
ariel
had
just
brought
them
from
titania
but
i
do
not
think
the
charm
was
in
the
hoops
themselves
you
had
cared
to
lead
a
cotillon
othmar
you
might
have
been
a
happier
man
i
do
not
doubt
the
frivolous
faculty
is
a
very
happy
one
all
events
though
you
despise
it
you
are
indulgent
to
it
you
gave
us
superb
presents
at
your
own
fête
come
in
to
breakfast
i
would
not
admit
it
if
platon
were
here
but
it
cold
surely
it
is
not
very
wise
to
be
in
the
cold
after
a
ball
is
what
they
all
said
so
i
came
i
have
not
much
sympathy
with
children
but
i
do
understand
why
they
like
to
do
a
thing
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
are
told
not
to
do
it
my
physicians
pretend
that
morning
air
is
as
bad
as
damp
shoes
but
i
believe
they
say
that
to
be
agreeable
to
their
patients
who
turn
night
into
day
it
is
not
only
molière
doctors
who
are
charlatans
i
imagine
it
is
the
perpetual
affectation
of
sympathy
which
doctors
are
compelled
to
put
on
which
makes
them
hypocrites
come
into
the
house
he
went
on
in
silence
beside
her
along
the
bay
path
he
could
not
easily
talk
of
trifles
with
her
she
had
filled
all
his
life
for
two
whole
years
he
loved
her
as
he
had
loved
no
other
woman
when
he
had
returned
home
from
the
millo
ball
he
had
bathed
and
swam
in
the
little
bay
of
pharamond
and
then
had
rowed
himself
along
the
coast
in
that
vague
irresistible
desire
to
pass
near
where
she
dwelt
which
every
true
lover
feels
he
had
resolved
to
emancipate
himself
from
her
power
as
he
had
watched
her
through
the
night
he
had
told
himself
that
to
care
for
her
was
to
waste
life
on
a
baseless
and
ungrateful
dream
yet
when
she
had
looked
down
from
her
evergreen
rampart
and
had
said
he
had
been
unable
to
resist
as
he
paced
beside
her
now
the
delicate
perfume
of
her
laces
the
floating
indefinite
lines
of
the
draperies
the
glimpse
of
her
profile
which
the
hood
showed
her
slender
feet
in
their
slippers
which
stepped
so
lightly
over
the
shining
shingle
of
the
paths
one
and
all
they
conquered
his
calmness
and
his
resolves
as
the
fumes
of
new
wine
mount
over
the
brain
and
move
the
senses
she
walked
on
provocative
as
venus
unattainable
as
una
speaking
idly
of
this
thing
and
of
that
knowing
very
well
what
made
his
answers
all
at
random
and
his
colour
changeful
other
women
might
need
to
use
all
the
arts
of
conquest
might
need
to
woo
with
their
eyes
to
charm
with
their
smiles
to
solicit
with
their
glances
she
had
no
such
vulgar
fashions
she
moved
spoke
looked
as
the
moment
actuated
her
and
noticed
her
lovers
hardly
more
than
she
noticed
the
little
dog
that
ran
after
her
skirts
to
exist
and
to
be
seen
was
enough
to
secure
her
more
victories
than
she
chose
to
count
if
she
noticed
othmar
more
than
others
it
was
because
he
had
gone
away
from
her
he
had
rebuked
her
he
had
appeared
to
defy
her
and
he
had
dared
to
tell
her
he
loved
her
with
more
reproach
and
more
bitterness
of
soul
than
any
other
had
ever
done
she
did
not
intend
to
accept
his
life
or
to
give
him
hers
but
she
did
intend
that
his
should
be
unable
to
detach
itself
and
all
the
while
she
talked
to
him
with
that
easy
even
kindness
as
of
a
friend
with
those
light
philosophies
of
a
woman
of
the
world
which
were
to
the
passions
of
a
man
as
ether
spray
thrown
upon
a
and
she
took
him
into
breakfast
with
her
as
though
he
were
her
brother
she
occasionally
drank
her
chocolate
in
a
boudoir
opening
on
to
the
terrace
a
little
nest
of
white
satin
and
and
saxe
china
the
ceiling
was
a
mirror
painted
with
little
doves
and
flowers
the
carpet
was
of
lambskins
the
corners
were
filled
with
azaleas
rose
and
white
like
her
gown
she
looked
only
a
larger
flower
as
she
sank
down
on
one
of
the
couches
the
chocolate
was
served
on
moorish
trays
in
turkish
cups
by
a
little
negro
who
gorgeous
in
his
dress
and
immovable
as
a
statue
was
often
taken
by
new
comers
for
an
enamelled
bronze
cast
by
barbédienne
so
motionless
did
he
squat
before
the
door
of
any
room
she
occupied
othmar
almost
envied
that
little
african
menial
the
right
he
had
to
see
his
mistress
pass
and
repass
a
hundred
times
a
day
nadine
in
her
nonchalant
way
was
kind
to
the
boy
will
die
of
pneumonia
they
always
do
she
said
now
dusky
little
beetles
they
only
live
by
their
hot
sand
and
their
hot
sun
to
be
sure
our
houses
inside
are
as
hot
as
africa
but
outside
the
east
wind
blows
and
one
day
it
will
blow
too
much
for
mahmoud
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
for
civilisation
if
the
east
ever
again
surged
over
the
west
but
the
east
has
very
much
to
avenge
and
i
am
not
sure
that
civilisation
would
be
any
great
loss
it
has
discovered
that
man
is
only
a
sort
of
hotbed
for
bacteria
and
that
butter
can
be
made
out
of
river
mud
and
coffee
out
of
powdered
tan
she
had
taken
the
hood
off
her
head
she
was
as
charming
as
a
child
freshly
out
of
a
bath
with
her
eyes
brilliant
and
her
cheeks
a
little
warmed
by
the
transition
from
the
chill
air
of
early
morning
to
the
room
heated
to
réaumur
she
had
tossed
herself
backwards
amongst
the
white
satin
cushions
her
eyes
which
were
like
onyx
dwelt
on
him
with
a
gleam
of
amusement
her
beautiful
mouth
had
the
smile
which
was
so
enigmatical
so
gay
and
yet
so
cold
she
had
had
a
different
smile
when
she
had
said
to
little
mahmoud
yourself
warmly
here
though
the
sun
shines
it
is
not
african
has
that
black
brat
done
that
you
are
so
merciful
to
him
asked
othmar
she
replied
black
brat
is
a
victim
of
civilisation
i
hate
civilisation
as
you
know
it
even
adulterates
truffles
you
ever
smile
so
kindly
on
your
own
children
can
not
say
i
do
not
count
my
smiles
that
poor
little
slave
is
interesting
he
is
an
exile
and
he
will
die
in
a
year
or
two
my
children
are
insufferably
uninteresting
they
have
unchangeable
health
intense
stupidity
and
will
grow
up
to
have
every
desire
fulfilled
every
caprice
gratified
and
to
become
that
irresponsible
useless
tyrannical
anachronism
a
russian
noble
perhaps
they
will
be
good
soldiers
and
kill
a
score
of
asiatics
perhaps
they
will
only
drink
brandy
and
gamble
othmar
did
not
reply
he
was
looking
at
the
exquisite
grace
of
her
form
the
tint
of
her
cheeks
was
it
possible
that
she
could
be
the
mother
of
two
stout
ugly
boys
it
seemed
to
him
a
profanation
a
hideous
incongruity
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
it
if
she
had
had
a
child
at
all
it
should
have
been
some
creature
sharing
her
own
grace
as
the
catkin
shares
the
willow
the
subtlest
charm
about
her
was
that
ethereality
as
of
a
virginal
goddess
which
was
blent
in
her
with
all
the
of
seduction
and
of
mind
the
boldest
man
felt
that
in
nadine
napraxine
the
senses
had
hardly
more
empire
than
in
the
ivory
venus
of
the
greeks
the
eyes
of
othmar
dwelt
on
her
now
yearningly
sombrely
wistfully
is
of
no
use
he
said
abruptly
did
wrong
to
come
here
if
you
wish
for
men
who
can
whilst
they
adore
you
sit
and
drink
chocolate
and
talk
epigrams
seek
elsewhere
i
am
not
one
of
them
i
can
wear
a
mask
but
it
must
be
of
iron
not
of
velvet
iron
mask
was
of
velvet
said
she
correcting
him
unmoved
by
the
repressed
passion
in
his
voice
our
illusions
vanish
under
the
electric
light
of
history
and
the
iron
mask
is
one
of
them
i
daily
expect
to
hear
that
marie
antoinette
was
never
guillotined
but
succumbed
at
seventy
to
dropsy
at
schönbrunn
we
know
it
is
proved
that
jeanne
married
and
died
at
orleans
and
her
family
enjoyed
a
pension
for
three
generations
from
the
town
it
is
very
distressing
but
it
is
all
proved
from
the
archives
why
should
you
drink
chocolate
perhaps
you
do
not
like
it
men
like
nothing
that
has
sugar
in
it
except
flattery
ring
they
will
bring
you
anything
else
othmar
looked
at
her
without
speaking
something
of
the
impotent
rage
against
her
with
which
he
had
left
her
in
paris
awoke
in
him
under
the
sting
of
her
ever
dulcet
tones
in
which
a
little
tone
of
mockery
could
be
felt
rather
than
heard
he
rose
abruptly
you
never
loved
anyone
he
asked
she
lifted
her
eyebrows
with
impatience
and
astonishment
voila
emballé
dear
othmar
i
should
like
you
so
much
if
you
would
not
always
revert
to
that
old
theme
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
or
you
ought
to
be
one
be
amusing
even
be
instructive
if
you
like
i
do
not
mind
being
instructed
but
do
not
be
romantic
nobody
is
nowadays
not
even
the
novelists
othmar
appeared
scarcely
to
hear
her
you
never
love
anyone
he
repeated
she
laughed
a
little
speak
as
if
i
were
forty
years
old
with
a
cabinet
full
of
old
letters
and
faded
roses
no
i
never
loved
anybody
not
even
platon
the
notion
suggested
in
her
last
words
tickled
her
fancy
so
much
that
she
laughed
outright
suppose
she
continued
in
the
world
there
are
women
who
have
loved
platon
but
it
seems
too
funny
he
is
always
eating
when
he
is
not
drinking
he
is
always
smoking
when
he
is
not
sleeping
that
cupid
must
fly
from
his
presence
how
grave
you
look
i
believe
you
have
something
of
the
eastern
in
you
and
think
that
all
women
should
be
prostrate
before
their
husbands
there
is
a
good
deal
of
that
idea
among
the
moujiks
it
must
be
very
agreeable
for
the
man
did
you
marry
him
said
othmar
gloomily
it
hurt
his
sense
of
honour
to
speak
of
napraxine
in
napraxine
house
yet
he
could
not
repress
the
question
my
friend
why
do
girls
always
marry
she
said
indifferently
the
marriage
is
there
because
the
families
have
arranged
it
because
one
does
not
know
because
one
wishes
for
freedom
for
jewels
for
the
world
because
one
does
not
care
to
be
a
chaperoned
at
every
step
there
are
many
reasons
that
make
one
marry
it
is
the
thing
to
do
everyone
does
it
when
a
girl
sees
the
young
married
women
she
sees
them
flirted
with
sought
monopolising
everything
it
is
like
standing
behind
a
shut
door
and
hearing
people
laughing
and
singing
on
the
other
side
while
you
can
not
get
to
them
besides
platon
did
as
well
as
anybody
else
he
is
more
than
most
he
never
interferes
he
is
very
peaceable
long
ago
is
it
five
years
six
why
could
i
not
meet
you
before
she
smiled
not
displeased
is
seven
years
oh
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
done
at
all
you
are
too
arrogant
we
should
have
quarrelled
before
a
month
was
out
besides
i
should
have
tormented
you
to
do
all
manner
of
impossibilities
with
your
immense
power
i
should
have
expected
you
to
buy
me
an
empire
othmar
was
very
pale
the
possibility
of
which
she
jested
so
airily
was
one
he
could
not
think
of
without
a
mist
before
his
eyes
a
quickening
of
his
heart
he
hesitated
to
say
what
rose
to
his
lips
she
would
only
call
it
think
you
might
be
a
great
man
othmar
if
you
were
not
othmar
she
pursued
do
not
feel
the
capabilities
he
replied
is
because
you
are
what
you
are
she
answered
are
something
like
a
king
of
england
a
king
of
england
might
have
all
the
talents
but
he
could
never
be
a
great
man
because
his
position
binds
him
hand
and
foot
and
makes
a
lay
figure
of
him
you
are
not
a
lay
figure
but
the
very
fact
that
you
are
otho
othmar
prevents
your
being
anything
besides
i
think
if
i
were
you
i
should
buy
some
great
sunshiny
fantastic
eastern
kingdom
and
reign
there
you
might
lead
the
life
of
a
haroum
alraschid
and
forget
all
about
our
stupid
europe
with
its
big
dinners
its
blundering
politics
its
unreal
religions
and
its
hideous
dress
charming
dream
if
you
were
with
me
no
you
would
not
want
me
you
would
have
two
thousand
slaves
each
more
beautiful
than
the
others
my
life
i
shall
want
you
he
spoke
under
his
breath
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
face
was
cold
almost
stern
but
his
eyes
were
ardent
and
full
of
passion
all
night
at
millo
he
had
sworn
to
himself
that
never
again
would
he
succumb
to
her
influence
or
allow
her
to
triumph
in
the
power
she
possessed
over
him
but
in
her
presence
he
was
unnerved
and
unable
to
keep
silent
she
lying
back
amongst
her
cushions
glanced
at
him
under
her
long
lashes
and
understood
very
well
the
strife
which
went
on
in
his
soul
the
pride
of
manhood
which
combatted
the
impulses
of
passion
the
impetus
which
could
not
be
resisted
the
impatience
of
his
own
weakness
which
vibrated
through
his
confession
was
the
use
of
your
going
to
mongolia
you
could
not
escape
she
thought
with
a
little
of
that
contemptuous
indulgence
which
she
always
felt
for
her
lovers
follies
and
a
little
of
a
newer
and
more
personal
gratification
for
othmar
touched
a
certain
chord
in
her
mind
a
certain
pulse
in
her
heart
which
others
had
not
done
there
was
nothing
commonplace
or
trivial
in
him
there
was
a
vague
power
unused
but
existent
which
commanded
her
respect
nadine
napraxine
despised
the
world
too
heartily
herself
not
to
have
sympathy
with
the
indifference
he
felt
for
his
own
potentialities
and
possessions
he
was
one
of
the
masters
of
the
world
and
he
only
wished
for
one
thing
on
earth
herself
there
was
a
flattery
in
that
which
pleased
even
her
sated
with
compliment
though
she
was
there
were
moments
when
she
thought
that
if
she
had
met
him
before
as
he
said
there
would
have
been
less
ennui
and
more
warmth
in
her
life
we
should
have
been
so
sure
to
have
tired
of
each
other
she
reflected
always
do
it
is
the
fault
of
marriage
it
compels
people
at
the
onset
to
see
so
much
of
one
another
that
they
have
nothing
new
left
with
which
to
meet
the
future
if
you
heard
the
best
of
bach
every
day
you
would
get
to
hate
bach
as
intensely
as
you
hate
a
street
organ
the
music
would
still
be
perfect
but
it
could
not
withstand
incessant
repetition
we
should
have
been
quite
idylically
in
love
for
a
few
months
i
am
sure
we
should
but
then
we
should
have
each
gone
our
several
ways
and
in
the
end
he
would
have
been
hardly
better
than
platon
aloud
however
she
only
said
with
a
little
smile
should
never
say
things
straight
out
like
that
othmar
you
should
never
go
beyond
a
suggestion
the
world
has
spoilt
you
so
greatly
that
it
has
let
you
get
blunt
it
is
a
pity
when
i
talk
to
people
i
always
feel
as
boucher
said
he
felt
when
he
talked
with
his
tout
ce
va
dire
je
rien
dit
if
we
could
only
always
remain
at
the
stage
when
we
are
just
going
to
speak
othmar
did
not
reply
his
face
was
very
pale
it
had
a
set
stern
look
as
though
he
exercised
great
he
was
angered
against
himself
for
being
there
for
having
let
her
lead
him
thither
merely
to
be
made
the
sport
of
her
subtle
and
sarcastic
intelligence
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
his
passion
were
unwelcome
to
her
his
presence
should
be
unwelcome
too
she
guessed
his
thoughts
with
that
rapid
intuition
which
is
the
gift
of
such
minds
as
hers
i
am
not
like
that
she
said
with
some
unspoken
amusement
am
not
startled
at
a
confession
like
yours
as
a
horse
starts
at
a
pistol
shot
it
seems
to
me
that
men
are
never
happy
unless
they
are
talking
in
that
kind
of
way
to
some
woman
who
does
not
belong
to
them
they
are
so
like
children
in
petersburg
last
year
i
saw
sachs
crying
for
a
sentinel
because
he
could
not
have
it
he
had
all
giroux
shop
in
his
own
nursery
but
that
did
not
do
you
are
like
sachs
ought
i
to
ring
the
bell
and
dismiss
you
why
should
i
i
do
not
think
so
only
very
primitive
beings
take
fright
at
declarations
besides
you
made
me
so
many
in
paris
and
then
you
went
to
the
mongols
i
never
knew
why
you
went
to
the
mongols
why
did
you
go
brutes
always
get
away
somewhere
to
be
unseen
as
long
as
their
wound
bleeds
said
othmar
with
some
bitterness
sachs
cried
for
that
she
said
as
she
lit
a
cigarette
women
scolded
him
but
i
said
to
them
why
do
you
scold
him
he
is
a
male
creature
therefore
he
must
weep
for
what
he
can
not
get
some
children
cry
for
the
moon
a
moon
or
a
or
a
woman
the
principle
is
the
same
othmar
rose
and
approached
her
he
seemed
scarcely
to
have
heard
her
jest
hear
me
a
moment
he
said
in
a
low
tone
through
whose
enforced
calmness
there
was
the
thrill
of
an
intense
passion
are
not
alarmed
at
declarations
they
are
nothing
to
you
you
neither
requite
nor
reject
them
they
amuse
you
that
is
all
you
are
used
to
do
just
what
you
please
with
men
i
understand
that
you
despise
them
so
far
as
you
deign
to
think
of
them
seriously
no
she
said
with
a
little
gesture
of
depreciation
is
too
strong
why
should
i
despise
them
for
acting
according
to
their
natures
i
do
not
desire
myself
but
i
did
not
despise
sachs
told
you
in
paris
pursued
othmar
i
would
not
add
one
to
the
list
of
those
whom
you
have
made
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
will
be
all
to
a
woman
or
nothing
to
her
you
would
have
let
me
swell
the
cortège
that
marks
your
triumphal
passage
you
would
have
let
me
fill
the
place
that
lord
geraldine
occupies
now
you
would
have
allowed
me
to
drive
with
you
dine
with
you
come
in
and
out
of
your
house
take
your
husband
away
when
he
bored
you
do
everything
that
lord
geraldine
is
permitted
to
do
now
and
you
would
have
repaid
me
as
you
repay
him
by
a
little
laugh
a
smile
now
and
then
a
vague
liking
which
would
have
grown
little
by
little
into
contempt
i
would
not
accept
that
place
in
your
household
i
would
not
then
i
left
you
though
it
cost
me
more
than
you
would
ever
know
or
pity
for
you
do
not
understand
what
love
is
i
went
away
i
desired
to
escape
from
you
i
did
escape
i
desired
also
to
forget
you
but
i
could
not
forget
you
are
not
a
woman
who
can
be
forgotten
you
are
like
one
of
those
with
which
they
stabbed
men
in
the
valois
days
that
look
like
mere
threads
of
silver
sheathed
in
velvet
and
yet
can
go
home
through
breast
and
bone
and
kill
more
surely
than
swords
that
are
as
high
as
a
man
shoulder
he
paused
a
moment
he
breathed
quickly
and
heavily
she
looked
up
holding
her
little
cigarette
suspended
am
like
a
great
many
things
she
murmured
thought
wilkes
exhausted
all
possibilities
in
comparison
this
morning
go
on
you
are
very
but
it
rather
becomes
you
you
may
go
on
if
you
like
he
dropped
on
his
knee
beside
her
i
would
not
be
what
geraldine
is
you
tolerate
him
now
to
scorn
him
immeasurably
hereafter
his
own
weakness
will
be
the
measure
of
your
scorn
he
has
never
dared
to
say
to
you
what
i
said
to
you
in
paris
what
i
say
now
love
me
or
i
will
not
see
your
face
again
except
as
society
may
compel
me
to
see
it
in
a
crowd
listen
nadine
i
love
you
only
you
i
never
thought
to
love
any
woman
so
but
i
love
you
as
men
did
in
the
old
times
and
there
is
nothing
i
will
not
surrender
to
you
save
my
own
if
to
meet
you
to
touch
your
hand
to
hear
your
voice
i
must
come
and
go
like
a
dog
in
your
husband
house
petted
one
day
chidden
the
next
absurd
in
my
own
sight
and
emasculated
in
the
sight
of
others
i
will
wrench
my
love
for
you
out
of
my
life
if
my
life
goes
with
it
last
night
i
heard
someone
who
did
not
know
him
inquire
who
geraldine
was
someone
else
answered
him
oh
that
is
one
of
princess
napraxine
she
never
looks
at
him
but
he
is
content
to
follow
her
shadow
you
know
me
very
little
if
you
believe
i
would
ever
let
the
world
speak
of
me
like
that
i
told
you
in
paris
i
would
never
be
the
trembling
valet
of
a
bloodless
platonism
she
looked
at
him
and
a
gleam
of
admiration
passed
into
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
breathed
a
trifle
more
quickly
she
thought
to
herself
is
superb
when
he
looks
and
speaks
like
that
un
homme
she
did
not
speak
she
leaned
back
amongst
her
cushions
with
a
little
look
of
expectancy
upon
her
face
the
whole
thing
pleased
her
as
some
admirable
piece
of
acting
on
the
boards
of
the
théâtre
français
pleased
at
once
her
eye
her
ear
and
her
taste
but
othmar
was
passionately
in
earnest
all
his
heart
was
in
his
lips
all
his
passions
had
found
voice
he
could
scarcely
see
her
for
the
red
mist
that
swam
before
his
eyes
for
the
tumult
of
his
senses
he
dropped
on
his
knee
beside
her
he
murmured
as
his
forehead
touched
her
hand
have
told
you
what
i
will
not
do
let
me
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
do
as
you
say
i
will
buy
some
sunlit
kingdom
far
away
in
the
heart
of
asia
and
i
will
take
you
to
it
and
obey
every
breath
of
your
mouth
as
my
one
divine
law
i
will
turn
my
back
on
europe
once
and
for
ever
i
will
let
men
call
me
a
coward
a
fool
an
infidel
what
they
will
i
will
give
all
my
present
and
all
my
future
to
you
and
to
you
alone
all
i
possess
shall
only
exist
to
minister
to
you
i
will
be
your
slave
body
and
mind
and
will
but
only
only
if
you
give
yourself
to
me
as
absolutely
in
return
only
if
you
come
with
me
where
nothing
of
this
world
which
we
have
known
shall
pursue
us
to
remind
me
that
you
were
ever
else
than
mine
his
forehead
burned
her
hand
as
it
touched
her
his
voice
was
passionate
in
its
emotion
and
eloquence
his
heart
beat
so
loudly
that
it
was
audible
in
the
stillness
around
them
for
once
she
was
touched
almost
awed
for
once
the
electricity
of
the
passion
she
excited
communicated
something
of
its
fire
and
thrill
to
her
she
was
silent
a
few
moments
her
eyelids
closed
her
lips
parted
she
felt
a
vague
pleasure
in
the
contact
of
this
intense
and
imperious
love
he
saw
upon
her
delicate
features
a
change
of
colour
a
flicker
of
emotion
which
no
one
else
had
ever
seen
there
but
she
motioned
him
farther
away
from
her
with
that
dislike
to
any
concession
and
that
sensitive
hauteur
which
but
added
to
her
charm
she
smiled
a
little
but
there
was
an
accent
which
was
almost
tenderness
in
her
voice
as
she
said
to
him
de
ne
rien
perdre
de
beaucoup
prier
you
evidently
have
belief
in
that
saying
it
is
to
ask
a
very
great
deal
but
then
you
would
give
a
great
deal
in
your
turn
go
away
now
i
will
think
no
i
shall
not
answer
you
i
want
time
for
thought
be
satisfied
that
i
am
not
offended
and
go
i
ought
to
be
so
i
suppose
but
i
am
not
go
may
come
back
his
heart
beat
eagerly
and
exultantly
he
was
not
refused
or
dismissed
qui
parle
femme
qui
écoutee
the
old
proverb
drifted
through
his
thoughts
all
confused
as
they
were
in
a
tumult
of
hope
and
desire
and
triumph
and
doubt
a
moment
hesitation
from
her
was
more
concession
than
a
thousand
caresses
from
a
humbler
woman
may
come
back
he
repeated
as
she
remained
silent
you
like
we
shall
meet
in
other
places
yes
you
may
return
in
a
fortnight
at
this
time
in
this
room
then
i
will
tell
you
a
fortnight
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
ten
years
thankful
for
so
much
she
said
as
she
gave
him
the
tips
of
her
fingers
go
mahmoud
is
in
the
antechamber
he
kissed
her
hand
with
lips
that
burned
like
fire
bowed
low
and
obeyed
her
nadine
napraxine
remained
motionless
her
eyes
were
closed
her
mouth
smiled
she
seemed
to
dream
