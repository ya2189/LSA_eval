chapter
i
my
strange
home
it
was
a
strange
day
the
day
that
i
was
born
the
waves
were
beating
against
the
lighthouse
and
the
wind
was
roaring
and
raging
against
everything
had
not
the
lighthouse
been
built
very
firmly
into
the
strong
solid
rock
it
and
all
within
it
must
have
been
swept
into
the
deep
wild
sea
it
was
a
terrible
storm
my
grandfather
said
he
had
never
known
such
a
storm
since
he
came
to
live
on
the
island
more
than
forty
years
before
many
ships
went
down
in
the
storm
that
day
and
many
lives
were
lost
but
in
the
very
midst
of
it
when
the
wind
was
highest
and
the
waves
were
strongest
and
when
the
foam
and
the
spray
had
completely
covered
the
lighthouse
windows
i
alick
fergusson
was
born
i
was
born
on
a
strange
day
and
i
was
born
into
a
strange
home
the
lighthouse
stood
on
an
island
four
miles
distant
from
any
land
the
island
was
not
very
large
if
you
stood
in
the
middle
of
it
you
could
see
the
sea
all
round
you
that
sea
which
was
sometimes
so
blue
and
peaceful
and
at
other
times
was
as
black
as
ink
and
roaring
and
thundering
on
the
rocky
shores
of
the
little
island
at
one
side
of
the
island
on
a
steep
rock
overhanging
the
sea
stood
the
lighthouse
night
by
night
as
soon
as
it
began
to
grow
dark
the
lighthouse
lamps
were
lighted
i
can
remember
how
i
used
to
admire
those
lights
as
a
child
i
would
sit
for
hours
watching
them
revolve
and
change
in
colour
first
there
was
a
white
light
then
a
blue
one
then
a
red
one
then
a
green
one
then
a
white
one
again
and
as
the
ships
went
by
they
always
kept
a
for
our
friendly
lights
and
avoided
the
rocks
of
which
they
warned
them
my
grandfather
old
sandy
fergusson
was
one
of
the
lighthouse
men
whose
duty
it
was
always
to
keep
these
lamps
in
order
and
to
light
them
every
night
he
was
a
clever
active
old
man
and
did
his
work
well
and
cheerfully
his
great
desire
was
to
be
able
to
hold
on
at
his
post
till
i
should
be
able
to
take
his
place
at
the
time
when
my
story
begins
i
was
nearly
twelve
years
old
and
daily
growing
taller
and
stronger
my
grandfather
was
very
proud
of
me
and
said
i
should
soon
be
a
young
man
and
then
he
should
get
me
appointed
in
his
place
to
look
after
the
lighthouse
i
was
very
fond
of
my
strange
home
and
would
not
have
changed
it
for
any
other
many
people
would
have
thought
it
dull
for
we
seldom
saw
a
strange
face
and
the
lighthouse
men
were
only
allowed
to
go
on
shore
for
a
few
hours
once
in
every
two
months
but
i
was
very
happy
and
thought
there
was
no
place
in
the
world
like
our
little
island
close
to
the
tower
of
the
lighthouse
was
the
house
in
which
i
and
my
grandfather
lived
it
was
not
a
large
house
but
it
was
a
very
pleasant
one
all
the
windows
looked
out
over
the
sea
and
plenty
of
sharp
sea
air
came
in
whenever
they
were
opened
all
the
furniture
in
the
house
belonged
to
the
lighthouse
and
had
been
there
long
before
my
grandfather
came
to
live
there
our
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
had
the
name
of
the
lighthouse
on
them
in
large
gilt
letters
and
a
little
picture
of
the
lighthouse
with
the
waves
dashing
round
it
i
used
to
think
them
very
pretty
when
i
was
a
boy
we
had
not
many
neighbours
there
was
only
one
other
house
on
the
island
and
it
was
built
on
the
other
side
of
the
lighthouse
tower
the
house
belonged
to
millar
who
shared
the
care
of
the
lighthouse
with
my
grandfather
just
outside
the
two
houses
was
a
court
with
a
pump
in
the
middle
from
which
we
got
our
water
there
was
a
high
wall
all
round
this
court
to
make
a
little
shelter
for
us
from
the
stormy
wind
beyond
this
court
were
two
gardens
divided
by
an
iron
railing
the
millars
garden
was
very
untidy
and
forlorn
and
filled
with
nettles
and
thistles
and
groundsel
and
all
kinds
of
weeds
for
millar
did
not
care
for
gardening
and
millar
had
six
little
children
and
had
no
time
to
look
after
it
but
our
garden
was
the
admiration
of
every
one
who
visited
the
island
my
grandfather
and
i
were
at
work
in
it
every
fine
day
and
took
a
pride
in
keeping
it
as
neat
as
possible
although
it
was
so
near
the
sea
our
garden
produced
most
beautiful
vegetables
and
fruit
and
the
borders
were
filled
with
flowers
and
pansies
and
and
many
other
hardy
plants
which
were
not
afraid
of
the
sea
air
outside
the
garden
was
a
field
full
of
small
hillocks
over
which
the
wild
rabbits
and
hares
with
which
the
island
abounded
were
continually
scampering
in
this
field
were
kept
a
cow
and
two
goats
to
supply
the
two
families
with
milk
and
butter
beyond
it
was
the
rocky
shore
and
a
little
pier
built
out
into
the
sea
illustration
the
landing
stage
on
this
pier
i
used
to
stand
every
monday
morning
to
watch
for
the
steamer
which
called
at
the
island
once
a
week
it
was
a
great
event
to
us
when
the
steamer
came
my
grandfather
and
i
and
and
millar
and
the
children
all
came
down
to
the
shore
to
welcome
it
this
steamer
brought
our
provisions
for
the
week
from
a
town
some
miles
off
and
often
brought
a
letter
for
millar
or
a
newspaper
for
my
grandfather
my
grandfather
did
not
get
many
letters
for
there
were
not
many
people
that
he
knew
he
had
lived
on
that
lonely
island
the
greater
part
of
his
life
and
had
been
quite
shut
out
from
the
world
all
his
relations
were
dead
now
except
my
father
and
what
had
become
of
him
we
did
not
know
i
had
never
seen
him
for
he
went
away
some
time
before
i
was
born
my
father
was
a
sailor
a
fine
tall
strong
young
fellow
my
grandfather
used
to
say
he
had
brought
my
mother
to
the
island
and
left
her
in
my
grandfather
care
whilst
he
went
on
a
voyage
to
australia
he
went
from
the
island
in
that
same
little
steamer
which
called
every
monday
morning
my
grandfather
stood
on
the
end
of
the
pier
as
the
steamer
went
out
of
sight
and
my
mother
waved
her
handkerchief
to
him
as
long
as
any
smoke
was
seen
on
the
horizon
grandfather
has
often
told
me
how
young
and
pretty
she
looked
that
summer
morning
my
father
had
promised
to
write
soon
but
no
letter
ever
came
mother
went
down
to
the
pier
every
monday
morning
for
three
long
years
to
see
if
it
had
brought
her
any
word
from
her
sailor
husband
but
after
a
time
her
step
became
slower
and
her
face
paler
and
at
last
she
was
too
weak
to
go
down
the
rocks
to
the
pier
when
the
steamer
arrived
on
monday
morning
and
soon
after
this
i
was
left
motherless
from
that
day
the
day
on
which
my
mother
died
my
grandfather
became
both
father
and
mother
to
me
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
have
done
for
me
and
wherever
he
went
and
whatever
he
did
i
was
always
by
his
side
as
i
grew
older
he
taught
me
to
read
and
write
for
there
was
of
course
no
school
which
i
could
attend
i
also
learnt
to
help
him
to
trim
the
lamps
and
to
work
in
the
garden
our
life
went
on
very
evenly
from
day
to
day
until
i
was
about
twelve
years
old
i
used
to
wish
sometimes
that
something
new
would
happen
to
make
a
little
change
on
the
island
and
at
last
a
change
came
chapter
ii
the
flare
at
sea
my
grandfather
and
i
were
sitting
at
tea
one
dark
november
evening
we
had
been
digging
in
the
garden
the
whole
morning
but
in
the
afternoon
it
had
become
so
wet
and
stormy
that
we
had
remained
indoors
we
were
sitting
quietly
at
our
tea
planning
what
we
would
do
the
next
day
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
millar
put
his
head
in
quick
he
said
here
my
grandfather
and
i
ran
to
the
door
and
looked
out
over
the
sea
there
about
three
miles
to
the
north
of
us
we
saw
a
bright
flare
of
light
it
blazed
up
for
a
moment
or
two
lighting
up
the
wild
and
stormy
sky
and
then
it
went
out
and
all
was
darkness
again
is
it
grandfather
i
asked
but
he
did
not
answer
me
no
time
to
lose
jem
he
said
out
with
the
boat
my
man
an
awful
sea
said
millar
looking
at
the
waves
beating
fiercely
against
the
rocks
mind
jem
said
my
grandfather
must
do
our
best
so
the
two
men
went
down
to
the
shore
and
i
followed
them
is
it
grandfather
i
asked
again
something
wrong
out
there
said
he
pointing
to
the
place
where
we
had
seen
the
light
the
flare
they
always
make
when
they
in
danger
and
want
help
at
once
you
going
to
them
grandfather
i
said
if
we
can
get
the
boat
out
he
said
jem
are
you
ready
me
go
with
you
grandfather
i
said
might
be
able
to
help
right
my
lad
he
said
try
if
we
can
get
her
off
i
can
see
that
scene
with
my
mind
eye
as
though
it
were
but
yesterday
my
grandfather
and
millar
straining
every
nerve
to
row
the
boat
from
land
whilst
i
clung
on
to
one
of
the
seats
and
tried
in
vain
to
steer
her
i
can
see
poor
millar
standing
on
the
pier
with
her
shawl
over
her
head
watching
us
and
two
of
her
little
girls
clinging
to
her
dress
i
can
see
the
waves
which
seemed
to
be
rising
higher
every
moment
and
ready
to
beat
our
little
boat
to
pieces
and
i
can
see
my
grandfather
disappointed
face
as
after
many
a
fruitless
attempt
he
was
obliged
to
give
it
up
no
use
i
afraid
jem
he
said
at
last
have
hands
enough
to
manage
her
so
we
got
to
shore
as
best
we
could
and
paced
up
and
down
the
little
pier
we
could
see
nothing
more
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
all
was
perfect
blackness
over
the
sea
the
lighthouse
lamps
were
burning
brightly
they
had
been
lighted
more
than
two
hours
before
it
was
millar
turn
to
watch
so
he
went
up
to
the
tower
and
my
grandfather
and
i
remained
on
the
pier
nothing
be
done
grandfather
afraid
not
my
lad
we
ca
make
any
way
against
such
a
sea
as
this
if
it
goes
down
a
bit
we
have
another
try
at
it
but
the
sea
did
not
go
down
we
walked
up
and
down
the
pier
almost
in
silence
presently
a
rocket
shot
up
into
the
sky
evidently
from
the
same
place
where
we
had
seen
the
flare
she
is
again
alick
poor
things
i
wonder
how
many
of
them
there
is
we
do
nothing
at
all
i
asked
again
my
lad
he
said
sea
too
much
for
us
it
a
terrible
night
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
day
you
were
born
so
the
night
wore
away
we
never
thought
of
going
to
bed
but
walked
up
and
down
the
pier
with
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
place
where
we
had
seen
the
lights
every
now
and
then
for
some
hours
rockets
were
sent
up
and
then
they
ceased
and
we
saw
nothing
got
no
more
with
them
said
my
grandfather
things
a
terrible
bad
job
wrong
with
them
grandfather
i
asked
there
rocks
over
there
there
the
ainslie
crag
just
there
it
a
nasty
place
that
a
very
nasty
place
many
a
fine
ship
has
been
lost
there
at
last
the
day
began
to
dawn
a
faint
grey
light
spread
over
the
sea
we
could
distinguish
now
the
masts
of
a
ship
in
the
far
distance
she
is
poor
thing
said
my
grandfather
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
close
on
ainslie
crag
i
thought
so
wind
gone
down
a
bit
now
has
it
i
asked
and
the
sea
a
bit
stiller
just
now
he
said
jem
a
call
alick
jem
millar
hastened
down
to
the
pier
with
his
arms
full
of
rope
right
jem
my
lad
said
my
grandfather
be
off
i
think
we
may
manage
it
now
so
we
jumped
into
the
boat
and
put
off
from
the
pier
it
was
a
fearful
struggle
with
the
wind
and
waves
and
for
a
long
time
we
seemed
to
make
no
way
against
them
both
the
men
were
much
exhausted
and
jem
millar
seemed
ready
to
give
in
up
jem
my
lad
said
my
grandfather
of
all
the
poor
fellows
out
there
let
have
one
more
try
so
they
made
a
mighty
effort
and
the
pier
was
left
a
little
way
behind
slowly
very
slowly
we
made
that
distance
greater
slowly
very
slowly
millar
who
was
standing
on
the
shore
faded
from
our
sight
and
the
masts
of
the
ship
in
distress
seemed
to
grow
a
little
more
near
yet
the
waves
were
still
fearfully
strong
and
appeared
ready
every
moment
to
swallow
up
our
little
boat
would
my
grandfather
and
millar
ever
be
able
to
hold
on
till
they
reached
the
ship
which
was
still
more
than
two
miles
away
that
i
cried
as
i
caught
sight
of
a
dark
object
rising
and
falling
with
the
waves
a
boat
surely
said
my
grandfather
jem
chapter
iii
the
bundle
saved
it
a
boat
of
which
i
had
caught
sight
a
boat
bottom
upwards
a
minute
afterwards
it
swept
close
past
us
so
near
that
we
could
almost
touch
it
lost
their
boat
pull
away
jem
grandfather
i
said
and
the
wind
was
so
high
i
could
only
make
him
hear
by
shouting
do
you
think
the
boat
was
full
he
said
think
they
tried
to
put
her
off
and
she
been
swept
away
keep
up
jem
for
jem
millar
who
was
not
a
strong
man
seemed
ready
to
give
in
we
were
now
considerably
more
than
between
the
boat
and
the
ship
it
seemed
as
if
those
on
board
had
caught
sight
of
us
for
another
rocket
went
up
they
had
evidently
kept
one
back
as
a
last
hope
in
case
any
one
should
pass
by
as
we
drew
nearer
we
could
see
that
it
was
a
large
ship
and
we
could
distinguish
many
forms
moving
about
on
deck
fellows
poor
fellows
said
my
grandfather
away
jem
nearer
and
nearer
we
came
to
the
ship
till
at
length
we
could
see
her
quite
distinctly
she
had
struck
on
ainslie
crag
and
her
stern
was
under
water
and
the
waves
were
beating
wildly
on
her
deck
we
could
see
men
clinging
to
the
rigging
which
remained
and
holding
on
to
the
broken
masts
of
the
ship
i
shall
forget
that
sight
to
my
dying
day
my
grandfather
and
jem
millar
saw
it
and
they
pulled
on
desperately
and
now
we
were
so
near
to
the
vessel
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
storm
which
was
raging
we
could
have
spoken
to
those
on
board
again
and
again
we
tried
to
come
alongside
the
shattered
ship
but
were
swept
away
by
the
rush
of
the
strong
resistless
waves
several
of
the
sailors
came
to
the
side
of
the
ship
and
threw
out
a
rope
to
us
it
was
long
before
we
could
catch
it
but
at
last
as
we
were
being
carried
past
it
i
clutched
it
and
my
grandfather
immediately
made
it
secure
he
cried
jem
we
shall
save
some
of
them
yet
and
he
pulled
the
boat
as
near
as
possible
to
the
ship
oh
how
my
heart
beat
that
moment
as
i
looked
at
the
men
and
women
all
crowding
towards
the
place
where
the
rope
was
fastened
ca
take
them
all
said
my
grandfather
anxiously
must
cut
the
rope
when
we
got
as
many
as
the
boat
will
carry
i
shuddered
as
i
thought
of
those
who
would
be
left
behind
we
had
now
come
so
close
to
the
ship
that
the
men
on
board
would
be
able
to
watch
their
opportunity
and
jump
into
the
boat
whenever
a
great
wave
was
past
and
there
was
a
lull
for
a
moment
in
the
storm
out
jem
cried
my
grandfather
the
a
man
was
standing
by
the
rope
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
bundle
in
his
arms
the
moment
we
came
near
he
seized
his
opportunity
and
threw
it
to
us
my
grandfather
caught
it
illustration
a
child
alick
he
said
it
down
by
you
a
child
alick
he
said
it
down
by
you
i
put
the
bundle
at
my
feet
and
my
grandfather
cried
another
quick
my
lads
but
at
this
moment
jem
millar
seized
his
arm
look
out
he
almost
shrieked
my
grandfather
turned
round
a
mighty
wave
bigger
than
any
i
had
seen
before
was
coming
towards
us
in
another
moment
we
should
have
been
dashed
by
its
violence
against
the
ship
and
all
have
perished
my
grandfather
hastily
let
go
the
rope
and
we
just
got
out
of
the
way
of
the
ship
before
the
wave
reached
us
and
then
came
a
noise
loud
as
a
terrible
as
the
mighty
wave
dashed
against
ainslie
crag
i
could
hardly
breathe
so
dreadful
was
the
moment
back
again
for
some
more
cried
my
grandfather
when
the
wave
had
passed
we
looked
round
but
the
ship
was
gone
it
had
disappeared
like
a
dream
when
one
awakes
as
if
it
had
never
been
that
mighty
wave
had
broken
its
back
and
shattered
it
into
a
thousand
fragments
nothing
was
to
be
seen
of
the
ship
or
its
crew
but
a
few
floating
pieces
of
timber
my
grandfather
and
millar
pulled
hastily
to
the
spot
but
it
was
some
time
before
we
could
reach
it
for
we
had
been
carried
by
the
sea
almost
a
mile
away
and
the
storm
seemed
to
be
increasing
in
violence
when
at
last
we
reached
that
terrible
ainslie
crag
we
were
too
late
to
save
a
single
life
we
could
not
find
one
of
those
on
board
the
greater
number
no
doubt
had
been
carried
down
in
the
vortex
made
by
the
sinking
ship
and
the
rest
had
risen
and
sunk
again
long
before
we
reached
them
for
some
time
we
battled
with
the
waves
unwilling
to
relinquish
all
hope
of
saving
some
of
them
but
we
found
at
last
that
it
was
of
no
use
and
we
were
obliged
to
return
all
had
perished
except
the
child
lying
at
my
feet
i
stooped
down
to
it
and
could
hear
that
it
was
crying
but
it
was
so
tightly
tied
up
in
a
blanket
that
i
could
not
see
it
nor
release
it
we
had
to
strain
every
nerve
to
reach
the
lighthouse
it
was
not
so
hard
returning
as
going
for
the
wind
was
in
our
favour
but
the
sea
was
still
strong
and
we
were
often
in
great
danger
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
lighthouse
lamps
and
steered
the
boat
as
straight
as
i
could
oh
how
thankful
we
were
to
see
those
friendly
lights
growing
nearer
and
at
last
the
pier
came
in
sight
and
millar
still
standing
there
watching
us
you
got
none
of
them
she
said
as
we
came
up
the
steps
but
a
child
said
my
grandfather
sadly
one
small
child
that
all
well
we
did
our
very
best
jem
my
lad
jem
was
following
my
grandfather
with
the
oars
over
his
shoulder
i
came
last
with
that
little
bundle
in
my
arms
the
child
had
stopped
crying
now
and
seemed
to
be
asleep
it
was
so
still
millar
wanted
to
take
it
from
me
and
to
undo
the
blanket
but
my
grandfather
said
your
time
mary
bring
the
child
into
the
house
my
lass
it
bitter
cold
out
here
so
we
all
went
up
through
the
field
and
through
our
garden
and
the
court
the
blanket
was
tightly
fastened
round
the
child
except
at
the
top
where
room
had
been
left
for
it
to
breathe
and
i
could
just
see
a
little
nose
and
two
closed
eyes
as
i
peeped
in
at
the
opening
the
bundle
was
a
good
weight
and
before
i
reached
the
house
i
was
glad
of
millar
help
to
carry
it
we
came
into
our
little
kitchen
and
millar
took
the
child
on
her
knee
and
unfastened
the
blanket
her
she
said
as
her
tears
fell
fast
a
little
girl
said
my
grandfather
it
is
it
a
bonnie
wee
lassie
chapter
iv
little
timpey
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
seen
a
prettier
face
than
that
child
she
had
light
brown
hair
and
round
rosy
cheeks
and
the
bluest
of
blue
eyes
she
awoke
as
we
were
looking
at
her
and
seeing
herself
amongst
strangers
she
cried
bitterly
little
thing
said
millar
wants
her
mother
ma
ma
ma
cried
the
little
girl
as
she
caught
the
word
millar
fairly
broke
down
at
this
and
sobbed
and
cried
as
much
as
the
child
my
lass
said
her
husband
up
thee
make
her
worse
if
thee
takes
on
so
but
millar
could
do
nothing
but
cry
think
if
it
was
our
polly
was
all
that
she
could
say
jem
just
think
if
it
was
our
polly
that
was
calling
for
me
my
grandfather
took
the
child
from
her
and
put
her
on
my
knee
mary
he
said
us
a
bit
of
fire
and
something
to
eat
there
a
good
woman
the
child
cold
and
hungered
and
we
much
about
the
same
ourselves
millar
bustled
about
the
house
and
soon
lighted
a
blazing
fire
then
she
ran
in
next
door
to
see
if
her
children
whom
she
had
left
with
a
little
servant
girl
were
all
right
and
she
brought
back
with
her
some
cold
meat
for
our
breakfast
i
sat
down
on
a
stool
before
the
fire
with
the
child
on
my
knee
she
seemed
to
be
about
two
years
old
a
strong
healthy
little
thing
she
had
stopped
crying
now
and
did
not
seem
to
be
afraid
of
me
but
whenever
any
of
the
others
came
near
she
hid
her
face
in
my
shoulder
millar
brought
her
a
basin
of
bread
and
milk
and
she
let
me
feed
her
she
seemed
very
weary
and
sleepy
as
if
she
could
hardly
keep
her
eyes
open
wee
lassie
said
my
grandfather
expect
they
pulled
her
out
of
her
bed
to
bring
her
on
deck
wo
you
put
her
to
bed
said
millar
put
her
in
our
polly
bed
she
sleep
there
quite
nice
she
will
but
the
child
clung
to
me
and
cried
so
loudly
when
millar
tried
to
take
her
that
my
grandfather
said
would
take
her
away
poor
motherless
lamb
she
takes
kindly
to
alick
let
her
bide
here
so
we
made
up
a
little
bed
for
her
on
the
sofa
and
millar
brought
one
of
little
polly
nightgowns
and
undressed
and
washed
her
and
put
her
to
bed
the
child
was
still
very
shy
of
all
of
them
but
me
she
seemed
to
have
taken
to
me
from
the
first
and
when
she
was
put
into
her
little
bed
she
held
out
her
tiny
hand
to
me
and
said
timpey
handie
does
she
say
bless
her
said
millar
for
it
was
almost
the
first
time
that
the
child
had
spoken
wants
me
to
hold
her
little
hand
i
said
little
hand
timpey
must
be
her
name
never
heard
of
such
a
name
said
millar
did
you
say
what
do
they
call
you
darling
she
said
to
the
child
but
the
little
blue
eyes
were
closing
wearily
and
very
soon
the
child
was
asleep
i
still
held
that
tiny
hand
in
mine
as
i
sat
beside
her
i
was
afraid
of
waking
her
by
putting
it
down
wonder
who
she
is
said
millar
in
a
whisper
as
she
folded
up
her
little
clothes
beautiful
things
on
to
be
sure
she
has
been
well
taken
care
of
anyhow
stop
here
something
written
on
the
little
petticoat
can
you
make
it
out
alick
i
laid
down
the
little
hand
very
carefully
and
took
the
tiny
petticoat
to
the
window
i
said
will
be
her
name
here
written
on
it
me
said
millar
that
will
be
her
name
dear
me
dear
me
to
think
of
her
poor
father
and
mother
at
the
bottom
of
that
dreadful
sea
just
think
if
it
was
our
polly
and
then
millar
cried
so
much
again
that
she
was
obliged
to
go
home
and
finish
her
cry
with
her
little
polly
clasped
tightly
in
her
arms
my
grandfather
was
very
worn
out
with
all
he
had
done
during
the
night
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
i
sat
watching
the
little
sleeping
child
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
leave
her
she
slept
very
quietly
and
peacefully
poor
little
pet
how
little
she
knows
what
has
happened
i
thought
and
my
tears
came
fast
and
fell
on
the
little
fat
hand
which
was
lying
on
the
pillow
but
after
a
few
minutes
i
leaned
my
head
against
the
sofa
and
fell
fast
asleep
i
had
had
no
sleep
the
night
before
and
was
quite
worn
out
i
was
awakened
some
hours
after
by
some
one
pulling
my
hair
and
a
little
voice
calling
in
my
ear
up
boy
up
up
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
little
roguish
face
looking
at
me
the
merriest
brightest
little
face
you
can
imagine
up
boy
please
she
said
again
in
a
coaxing
voice
so
i
lifted
up
my
head
and
she
climbed
out
of
her
little
bed
on
the
sofa
on
to
my
knee
shoes
on
boy
she
said
holding
out
her
little
bare
toes
i
put
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
then
millar
came
in
and
dressed
her
it
was
a
lovely
afternoon
the
storm
had
ceased
whilst
we
had
been
asleep
and
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
i
got
the
dinner
ready
and
the
child
watched
me
and
ran
backwards
and
forwards
up
and
down
the
kitchen
she
seemed
quite
at
home
now
and
very
happy
my
grandfather
was
still
asleep
so
i
did
not
wake
him
millar
brought
in
some
broth
she
had
made
for
the
child
and
we
dined
together
i
wanted
to
feed
her
as
i
had
done
the
night
before
but
she
said
have
please
and
took
the
spoon
from
me
and
fed
herself
so
prettily
i
could
not
help
watching
her
bless
her
poor
little
thing
said
millar
bless
said
the
child
the
words
were
evidently
familiar
to
her
must
have
heard
her
mother
say
so
said
millar
in
a
choking
voice
when
we
had
finished
dinner
the
child
slipped
down
from
her
stool
and
ran
to
the
sofa
here
she
found
my
grandfather
hat
which
she
put
on
her
head
and
my
scarf
which
she
hung
round
her
neck
then
she
marched
to
the
door
and
said
tatta
timpey
go
tatta
her
out
a
bit
alick
said
millar
a
minute
though
i
fetch
her
polly
hood
so
to
her
great
delight
we
dressed
her
in
polly
hood
and
put
a
warm
shawl
round
her
and
i
took
her
out
oh
how
she
ran
and
jumped
and
played
in
the
garden
i
never
saw
such
a
merry
little
thing
now
she
was
picking
up
stones
now
she
was
gathering
daisies
days
she
called
them
now
she
was
running
down
the
path
and
calling
to
me
to
catch
her
she
was
never
still
a
single
instant
illustration
after
the
storm
but
every
now
and
then
as
i
was
playing
with
her
i
looked
across
the
sea
to
ainslie
crag
the
sea
had
not
gone
down
much
though
the
wind
had
ceased
and
i
saw
the
waves
still
dashing
wildly
upon
the
rocks
and
i
thought
of
what
lay
beneath
them
of
the
shattered
ship
and
of
the
child
mother
oh
if
she
only
knew
i
thought
as
i
listened
to
her
merry
laugh
which
made
me
more
ready
to
cry
than
her
tears
had
done
chapter
the
unclaimed
sunbeam
my
grandfather
and
jem
millar
were
sitting
over
the
fire
in
the
little
watchroom
in
the
lighthouse
tower
and
i
sat
beside
them
with
the
child
on
my
knee
i
had
found
an
old
for
her
and
she
was
turning
over
the
leaves
and
making
her
funny
little
remarks
on
the
pictures
sandy
said
millar
shall
we
do
with
her
with
her
said
my
grandfather
stroking
her
little
fair
head
keep
her
wo
we
little
lassie
said
the
child
looking
up
and
nodding
her
head
as
if
she
understood
all
about
it
ought
to
look
up
some
of
her
relations
it
seems
to
me
said
jem
sure
to
have
some
somewhere
how
are
we
to
find
them
out
asked
my
grandfather
the
captain
can
soon
make
out
for
us
what
ship
is
missing
and
we
can
send
a
line
to
the
owners
they
know
who
the
passengers
was
said
my
grandfather
you
right
jem
we
see
what
they
say
but
for
my
part
if
them
that
cares
for
the
child
is
at
the
bottom
of
that
sea
i
hope
no
one
else
will
come
and
take
her
away
from
us
i
had
so
many
of
them
at
home
millar
yes
my
lad
i
know
that
said
my
grandfather
interrupting
him
thy
house
is
full
enough
already
let
the
wee
lassie
come
to
alick
and
me
she
be
a
nice
little
bit
of
company
for
us
and
mary
will
see
to
her
clothes
and
such
like
i
know
that
she
will
said
her
husband
do
declare
she
has
been
crying
about
that
child
the
best
part
of
the
day
she
has
indeed
my
grandfather
followed
jem
advice
and
told
captain
sayers
when
he
came
in
the
steamer
the
next
monday
the
whole
story
of
the
shipwreck
and
asked
him
to
find
out
for
him
the
name
and
address
of
the
owners
of
the
vessel
oh
how
i
hoped
that
no
one
would
come
to
claim
my
little
darling
she
became
dearer
to
me
every
day
and
i
felt
as
if
it
would
break
my
heart
to
part
with
her
every
night
when
millar
had
undressed
her
she
knelt
beside
me
in
her
little
white
nightgown
to
to
god
as
she
called
praying
she
had
evidently
learnt
a
little
prayer
from
her
mother
for
the
first
night
she
began
of
her
own
accord
eppy
hear
me
i
could
not
think
at
first
what
it
was
that
she
was
saying
but
millar
said
she
had
learnt
the
hymn
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
she
wrote
out
the
first
verse
for
me
and
every
night
afterwards
i
let
the
child
repeat
it
after
me
tender
shepherd
hear
me
bless
thy
little
lamb
through
the
darkness
be
thou
near
me
keep
me
safe
till
morning
light
i
thought
i
should
like
her
always
to
say
the
prayer
her
mother
had
taught
her
i
never
prayed
myself
my
grandfather
had
never
taught
me
i
wondered
if
my
mother
would
have
taught
me
if
she
had
lived
i
thought
she
would
i
knew
very
little
in
those
days
of
the
bible
my
grandfather
did
not
care
for
it
and
never
read
it
he
had
a
large
bible
but
it
was
always
laid
on
the
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
as
a
kind
of
ornament
and
unless
i
took
it
down
to
look
at
the
curious
old
pictures
inside
it
was
never
opened
sunday
on
the
island
was
just
the
same
as
any
other
day
my
grandfather
worked
in
the
garden
or
read
the
newspaper
just
the
same
as
usual
and
i
rambled
about
the
rocks
or
did
my
lessons
or
worked
in
the
house
as
i
did
every
other
day
in
the
week
we
had
no
church
or
chapel
to
go
to
and
nothing
happened
to
mark
the
day
i
often
think
now
of
that
dreadful
morning
when
we
went
across
the
stormy
sea
to
that
sinking
ship
if
our
boat
had
capsized
then
if
we
had
been
lost
what
would
have
become
of
our
souls
it
is
a
very
solemn
thought
and
i
can
not
be
too
thankful
to
god
for
sparing
us
both
a
little
longer
my
grandfather
was
a
honest
old
man
but
i
know
now
that
that
is
not
enough
to
open
the
door
of
heaven
jesus
is
the
only
way
there
and
my
grandfather
knew
little
of
and
cared
nothing
for
little
timpey
became
my
constant
companion
indoors
and
out
of
doors
she
was
rather
shy
of
the
little
millars
for
they
were
noisy
and
rough
in
their
play
but
she
clung
to
me
and
never
wanted
to
leave
me
day
by
day
she
learnt
new
words
and
came
out
with
such
odd
little
remarks
of
her
own
that
she
made
us
all
laugh
her
great
pleasure
was
to
get
hold
of
a
book
and
pick
out
the
different
letters
of
the
alphabet
which
although
she
could
hardly
talk
she
knew
quite
perfectly
dear
little
pet
i
can
see
her
now
sitting
at
my
feet
on
a
large
flat
rock
by
the
seashore
and
calling
me
every
minute
to
look
at
a
or
b
or
d
or
and
so
by
her
pretty
ways
she
crept
into
all
our
hearts
and
we
quite
dreaded
the
answer
coming
to
the
letter
my
grandfather
had
written
to
the
owners
of
the
which
we
found
was
the
name
of
the
lost
ship
it
was
a
very
wet
day
the
monday
that
the
answer
came
i
had
been
waiting
some
time
on
the
pier
and
was
wet
through
before
the
steamer
arrived
captain
sayers
handed
me
the
letter
before
anything
else
and
i
ran
up
with
it
to
my
grandfather
at
once
i
could
not
wait
until
our
provisions
and
supplies
were
brought
on
shore
little
timpey
was
sitting
on
a
stool
at
my
grandfather
feet
winding
a
long
piece
of
tape
round
and
round
her
little
finger
she
ran
to
meet
me
as
i
came
in
and
held
up
her
face
to
be
kissed
what
if
this
letter
should
say
she
was
to
leave
us
and
go
back
by
the
steamer
i
drew
a
long
breath
as
my
grandfather
opened
it
it
was
a
very
civil
letter
from
the
owners
of
the
ship
thanking
us
for
all
we
had
done
to
save
the
unhappy
crew
and
passengers
but
saying
they
knew
nothing
of
the
child
or
her
belongings
as
no
one
of
the
name
of
villiers
had
taken
a
cabin
and
there
was
no
sailor
on
board
of
that
name
but
they
said
they
would
make
further
inquiries
in
calcutta
from
which
port
the
vessel
had
sailed
meanwhile
they
begged
my
grandfather
to
take
charge
of
the
child
and
assured
him
he
should
be
handsomely
rewarded
for
his
trouble
right
i
said
when
he
had
finished
reading
it
she
has
to
go
yet
said
my
grandfather
wee
lassie
we
ca
spare
her
yet
i
do
want
any
of
their
rewards
alick
not
i
that
reward
enough
for
me
he
said
as
he
lifted
up
the
child
to
kiss
his
wrinkled
forehead
chapter
vi
the
old
gentleman
question
the
next
monday
morning
timpey
and
i
went
down
together
to
the
pier
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
she
had
brought
a
doll
with
her
which
millar
had
given
her
and
of
which
she
was
very
proud
captain
sayers
sent
for
me
as
soon
as
the
steamer
came
up
to
the
pier
to
tell
me
that
two
gentlemen
had
come
to
see
my
grandfather
i
held
the
child
hand
very
tightly
in
mine
for
i
had
felt
sure
they
had
come
for
her
the
gentlemen
came
up
the
steps
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
one
of
them
was
a
man
with
a
very
clever
face
i
thought
he
told
me
he
had
come
to
see
alexander
fergusson
and
asked
me
if
i
could
direct
him
which
way
to
go
to
the
house
sir
i
said
fergusson
is
my
grandfather
so
we
went
up
towards
the
lighthouse
timpey
and
i
walking
first
to
lead
the
way
and
the
gentlemen
following
the
other
gentleman
was
quite
old
and
had
white
hair
and
gold
spectacles
and
a
pleasant
kindly
face
timpey
could
not
walk
very
fast
and
she
kept
running
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
another
to
gather
flowers
or
pick
up
stones
to
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
that
your
little
sister
asked
the
old
gentleman
sir
i
said
is
the
little
girl
who
was
on
board
the
me
dear
me
said
both
gentlemen
at
once
me
look
at
her
said
the
old
man
arranging
his
spectacles
but
timpey
was
frightened
and
clung
to
me
and
began
to
cry
mind
never
mind
said
the
old
gentleman
kindly
make
friends
with
one
another
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
house
and
the
gentleman
introduced
himself
as
septimus
forster
one
of
the
owners
of
the
lost
vessel
and
said
that
he
and
his
davis
had
come
to
hear
all
particulars
that
my
grandfather
could
give
them
with
regard
to
the
shipwreck
my
grandfather
begged
them
to
sit
down
and
told
me
to
prepare
breakfast
for
them
at
once
they
were
very
pleasant
gentlemen
both
of
them
and
were
very
kind
to
my
grandfather
forster
wanted
to
make
him
a
handsome
present
for
what
he
had
done
but
my
grandfather
would
not
take
it
they
talked
much
of
little
timpey
and
i
kept
stopping
to
listen
as
i
was
setting
out
the
cups
and
saucers
they
had
heard
nothing
more
of
her
relations
and
they
said
it
was
a
very
strange
thing
that
no
such
name
as
villiers
was
to
be
found
on
the
list
of
passengers
on
board
they
offered
to
take
her
away
with
them
till
some
relation
was
found
but
my
grandfather
begged
to
keep
her
the
gentlemen
seeing
how
happy
and
well
cared
for
the
child
was
gladly
consented
after
breakfast
forster
said
he
should
like
to
see
the
lighthouse
so
my
grandfather
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
with
him
and
showed
him
with
great
pride
all
that
was
to
be
seen
there
old
davis
was
tired
and
stayed
behind
with
little
timpey
and
me
is
a
strong
house
my
lad
he
said
when
the
others
had
gone
sir
i
said
ought
to
be
strong
the
wind
is
fearful
here
sometimes
sort
of
a
foundation
has
it
said
the
old
man
tapping
the
floor
with
his
stick
it
all
rock
sir
i
answered
rock
our
house
and
the
lighthouse
tower
are
all
built
into
the
rock
they
would
never
stand
if
they
are
on
the
rock
my
lad
said
davis
looking
at
me
through
his
spectacles
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
said
for
i
thought
i
had
not
heard
him
rightly
on
the
rock
he
repeated
the
rock
sir
oh
yes
i
said
thinking
he
could
not
have
understood
what
i
said
before
these
buildings
are
built
into
the
rock
or
the
wind
and
sea
would
carry
them
away
said
the
old
gentleman
again
on
the
rock
do
quite
understand
you
sir
i
said
mind
he
said
ask
your
grandfather
when
he
comes
down
so
i
sat
still
wondering
what
he
could
mean
and
almost
thinking
he
must
have
gone
out
of
his
mind
as
soon
as
my
grandfather
returned
he
put
the
same
question
to
him
and
my
grandfather
answered
it
as
i
had
done
by
assuring
him
how
firmly
and
strongly
the
lighthouse
and
its
surroundings
were
built
into
the
solid
rock
you
yourself
said
davis
long
have
you
been
on
the
rock
sir
said
my
grandfather
suppose
you
mean
how
long
have
i
lived
here
forty
years
sir
forty
years
come
the
twelfth
of
next
month
lived
on
this
rock
how
much
longer
do
you
expect
to
live
here
said
the
old
gentleman
i
do
know
sir
said
my
grandfather
long
as
i
live
i
suppose
alick
here
will
take
my
place
he
a
fine
strong
boy
is
alick
sir
where
will
you
live
when
you
leave
the
island
asked
davis
i
never
mean
to
leave
it
said
my
grandfather
till
i
die
sir
where
will
you
live
i
do
know
sir
said
my
grandfather
heaven
i
suppose
but
dear
me
i
not
going
there
just
yet
he
said
as
if
he
did
not
like
the
turn
the
conversation
was
taking
you
mind
answering
me
one
more
question
said
old
davis
you
kindly
tell
me
you
think
you
go
to
heaven
you
mind
my
asking
you
will
you
dear
no
said
my
grandfather
at
all
sir
well
sir
you
see
i
never
done
anybody
any
harm
and
god
is
very
merciful
and
so
no
doubt
it
will
be
all
right
at
last
my
dear
friend
said
the
old
gentleman
thought
you
said
you
were
on
the
rock
you
not
on
the
rock
at
all
you
on
the
sand
he
was
going
to
add
more
when
one
of
captain
sayer
men
ran
up
to
say
the
steamer
was
ready
to
start
and
would
they
kindly
come
at
once
as
it
was
late
already
so
the
two
gentlemen
jumped
up
and
prepared
hastily
to
go
down
to
the
beach
but
as
old
davis
took
leave
of
my
grandfather
he
said
earnestly
friend
you
are
building
on
the
sand
you
are
indeed
and
it
stand
the
storm
no
it
wo
stand
the
storm
he
had
no
time
to
say
more
the
sailor
hastened
him
away
i
followed
them
down
to
the
pier
and
stood
there
watching
the
steamer
preparing
to
start
there
was
a
little
delay
after
the
gentlemen
went
on
board
and
i
saw
davis
sit
down
on
a
seat
on
deck
take
out
his
and
write
something
on
one
of
the
leaves
then
he
tore
the
leaf
out
and
gave
it
to
one
of
the
sailors
to
hand
to
me
as
i
stood
on
the
pier
and
in
another
moment
the
steamer
had
started
chapter
vii
a
thick
fog
that
little
piece
of
paper
which
was
given
me
that
day
i
have
it
still
put
by
amongst
my
greatest
treasures
there
was
not
much
written
on
it
only
two
lines
of
a
hymn
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
i
walked
slowly
up
to
the
house
thinking
my
grandfather
was
out
with
jem
millar
so
i
did
not
show
him
the
paper
then
but
i
read
the
lines
many
times
over
as
i
was
playing
with
little
timpey
and
i
wondered
very
much
what
they
meant
in
the
evening
my
grandfather
and
jem
millar
generally
sat
together
over
the
fire
in
the
little
watchroom
upstairs
and
i
used
to
take
little
timpey
up
there
until
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
to
bed
she
liked
climbing
up
the
stone
steps
in
the
lighthouse
tower
she
used
to
call
out
up
up
as
she
went
along
until
she
reached
the
top
step
and
then
she
would
run
into
the
watchroom
with
a
merry
laugh
as
we
went
in
this
evening
my
grandfather
and
jem
were
talking
together
of
the
visit
of
the
two
gentlemen
ca
think
what
the
old
man
meant
about
the
rock
my
grandfather
was
saying
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
jem
could
you
my
lad
there
grandfather
i
said
as
i
handed
him
the
little
piece
of
paper
and
told
him
how
i
had
got
it
to
be
sure
said
my
grandfather
he
gave
you
this
did
he
and
he
read
aloud
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
now
jem
what
does
he
mean
he
kept
on
saying
to
me
you
on
the
sand
my
friend
you
on
the
sand
and
it
wo
stand
the
storm
what
do
you
make
of
it
jem
did
you
hear
him
my
lad
said
jem
thoughtfully
it
has
set
me
thinking
sandy
i
know
what
he
meant
well
enough
pray
what
may
that
be
meant
we
ca
get
to
heaven
except
we
come
to
christ
we
get
no
other
way
that
just
what
it
means
sandy
you
mean
to
tell
me
said
my
grandfather
i
sha
get
to
heaven
if
i
do
my
best
it
wo
do
sandy
there
only
one
way
to
heaven
i
know
that
well
enough
me
jem
said
my
grandfather
never
heard
you
talk
like
that
before
said
jem
forgot
all
about
it
since
i
came
to
the
island
i
had
a
good
mother
years
ago
i
ought
to
have
done
better
than
i
have
done
he
said
no
more
but
he
was
very
silent
all
the
evening
grandfather
read
his
newspaper
aloud
and
talked
on
all
manner
of
subjects
but
jem
millar
thoughts
seemed
far
away
the
next
day
was
his
day
for
going
on
shore
my
grandfather
and
jem
took
it
in
turns
the
last
friday
in
every
month
it
was
the
only
time
they
were
allowed
to
leave
the
island
when
it
was
my
grandfather
turn
i
generally
went
with
him
and
much
enjoyed
getting
a
little
change
but
whichever
of
them
went
it
was
a
great
day
with
us
on
the
island
for
they
bought
any
little
things
that
we
might
be
needing
for
our
houses
or
gardens
and
did
any
business
that
had
to
be
done
on
shore
we
all
went
down
to
the
pier
to
see
jem
millar
start
and
as
i
was
helping
him
to
get
on
board
some
empty
sacks
and
some
other
things
he
had
to
take
with
him
he
said
to
me
in
an
undertone
my
lad
keep
that
bit
of
paper
it
all
true
what
that
old
gentleman
said
i
been
thinking
of
it
ever
since
and
alick
he
whispered
believe
i
on
the
rock
now
he
said
no
more
but
arranged
his
oars
and
in
a
minute
more
he
was
off
but
as
he
rowed
away
i
heard
him
singing
softly
to
himself
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
we
watched
the
boat
out
of
sight
and
then
went
home
wishing
that
it
was
evening
and
that
jem
was
back
again
with
all
the
things
that
we
had
asked
him
to
get
for
us
that
was
a
very
gloomy
afternoon
a
thick
fog
came
over
the
sea
and
gradually
closed
us
in
so
that
we
could
hardly
see
a
step
before
us
on
the
beach
little
timpey
began
to
cough
so
i
took
her
indoors
and
amused
her
there
with
a
it
grew
so
dark
that
my
grandfather
lighted
the
lighthouse
lamps
soon
after
dinner
there
was
a
dull
yellow
light
over
everything
i
never
remember
a
more
gloomy
afternoon
and
as
evening
came
on
the
fog
grew
denser
till
at
length
we
could
see
nothing
outside
the
windows
it
was
no
use
looking
out
for
jem
return
for
we
could
not
see
the
sea
much
less
any
boat
upon
it
so
we
stayed
indoors
and
my
grandfather
sat
by
the
fire
smoking
his
pipe
thought
jem
would
have
been
here
before
now
he
said
at
length
as
i
was
putting
out
the
cups
and
saucers
for
tea
he
come
before
we
finished
tea
i
think
grandfather
i
answered
wonder
what
sort
of
a
spade
he
have
got
for
us
when
tea
was
over
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
we
looked
up
expecting
to
see
jem
enter
with
our
purchases
but
it
was
not
jem
it
was
his
wife
she
said
time
do
you
make
it
my
clock
stopped
minutes
past
six
said
my
grandfather
looking
at
his
watch
six
she
repeated
jem
very
late
said
my
grandfather
go
down
to
the
pier
and
have
a
look
out
but
he
came
back
soon
saying
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
the
fog
was
so
thick
he
was
almost
afraid
of
walking
over
the
pier
bound
to
be
in
at
seven
he
said
for
that
was
the
hour
the
lighthousemen
were
required
to
be
on
the
island
again
he
soon
be
up
now
the
clock
moved
on
and
still
jem
millar
did
not
come
i
saw
millar
running
to
her
door
every
now
and
then
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
to
look
down
the
garden
path
but
no
one
came
at
last
the
clock
struck
seven
never
knew
him
do
such
a
thing
before
said
my
grandfather
as
he
rose
to
go
down
to
the
pier
once
more
chapter
viii
waiting
for
the
boat
poor
millar
went
out
of
her
house
and
followed
my
grandfather
down
to
the
pier
i
waited
indoors
with
little
timpey
straining
my
ears
to
listen
for
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
coming
back
again
but
the
clock
struck
seven
and
still
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
i
could
wait
no
longer
i
wrapped
the
child
in
a
shawl
and
carried
her
into
the
millars
house
and
left
her
under
the
care
of
millar
little
servant
and
then
i
ran
down
through
the
thick
smothering
fog
to
the
pier
my
grandfather
was
standing
there
with
millar
when
i
came
close
to
them
he
was
saying
up
mary
my
lass
he
all
right
he
only
waiting
till
this
mist
has
cleared
away
a
bit
you
go
home
and
tell
you
as
soon
as
ever
i
hear
his
boat
coming
why
you
wet
through
woman
you
get
your
death
of
cold
her
thin
calico
dress
was
soaked
with
the
damp
in
the
air
and
she
was
shivering
and
looked
as
white
as
a
sheet
at
first
she
would
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
the
pier
but
as
time
went
on
and
it
grew
darker
and
colder
she
consented
to
do
as
my
grandfather
told
her
and
he
promised
he
would
send
me
up
to
the
lighthouse
to
tell
her
as
soon
as
jem
arrived
when
she
was
gone
my
grandfather
said
there
something
wrong
with
jem
depend
upon
it
i
did
like
to
tell
her
so
poor
soul
if
we
only
had
the
boat
i
would
go
out
a
bit
of
way
and
see
we
walked
up
and
down
the
pier
and
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
listen
if
we
could
hear
the
sound
of
oars
in
the
distance
for
we
should
not
be
able
to
see
the
boat
till
it
was
close
upon
us
so
dense
had
the
fog
become
me
my
grandfather
kept
saying
anxiously
wish
he
would
come
my
thoughts
went
back
to
the
bright
sunny
morning
when
jem
millar
had
started
and
we
had
heard
him
singing
as
he
went
those
two
lines
of
the
hymn
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
the
time
passed
on
would
he
never
come
we
grew
more
and
more
anxious
millar
came
running
down
to
say
her
mistress
wanted
to
know
if
we
could
hear
anything
yet
my
grandfather
said
yet
my
lass
but
it
ca
be
long
now
is
so
poorly
said
the
girl
think
she
got
a
cold
she
shakes
all
over
and
she
keeps
fretting
so
soul
well
perhaps
it
better
so
do
you
mean
grandfather
i
asked
if
aught
amiss
she
wo
be
so
taken
aback
as
if
she
afraid
and
if
jem
all
right
why
she
only
be
the
better
pleased
the
girl
went
back
and
we
still
waited
on
the
pier
i
said
at
length
think
i
hear
a
boat
it
was
a
very
still
night
we
stood
and
listened
at
first
my
grandfather
said
he
heard
nothing
but
at
length
he
distinguished
as
i
did
the
regular
plash
plash
plash
of
oars
in
the
distance
it
a
boat
said
my
grandfather
i
was
hastening
to
leave
the
pier
and
run
up
to
the
house
to
tell
millar
but
my
grandfather
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
a
bit
alick
my
lad
he
said
us
hear
what
it
is
first
maybe
it
is
jem
after
all
it
coming
here
grandfather
i
can
hear
it
better
now
he
said
coming
here
but
he
still
kept
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
the
boat
had
been
a
long
way
off
when
we
first
heard
it
for
it
was
many
minutes
before
the
sound
of
the
oars
seemed
to
become
much
more
distinct
but
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
nearer
yes
the
boat
was
evidently
making
for
the
island
at
last
it
came
so
near
that
my
grandfather
called
out
from
the
end
of
the
pier
jem
you
late
my
lad
said
a
voice
from
the
boat
but
it
was
jem
voice
is
your
said
the
voice
so
thick
i
ca
see
jem
is
there
grandfather
i
said
catching
hold
of
his
arm
said
my
grandfather
knew
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
lad
he
called
out
to
the
man
in
the
boat
the
direction
in
which
he
was
to
row
and
then
he
and
i
went
down
the
steps
together
and
waited
for
the
boat
to
come
up
there
were
four
men
in
the
boat
they
were
sailors
and
strangers
to
me
one
of
them
the
one
whose
voice
we
had
heard
got
out
to
speak
to
my
grandfather
wrong
said
my
grandfather
before
he
could
begin
wrong
with
that
poor
lad
said
the
man
got
him
here
and
he
pointed
to
the
boat
a
cold
shudder
passed
over
me
as
he
said
this
and
i
caught
sight
of
something
lying
at
the
men
feet
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
wrong
with
him
has
he
had
an
accident
is
he
much
hurt
dead
said
the
man
solemnly
dear
said
my
grandfather
in
a
choking
voice
shall
we
tell
his
wife
however
shall
we
tell
poor
mary
illustration
did
it
happen
i
asked
did
it
happen
i
asked
at
length
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
was
getting
a
sack
of
flour
on
board
over
yonder
said
one
of
the
men
in
the
boat
it
was
awful
thick
and
foggy
and
he
missed
his
footing
on
the
plank
and
fell
in
that
how
it
happened
said
another
man
it
seems
he
could
swim
and
there
was
no
boat
nigh
at
hand
to
help
him
joe
malcolmson
was
there
and
saw
him
fall
in
but
before
he
could
call
any
of
us
it
was
all
over
with
him
we
got
him
out
at
last
but
he
was
quite
gone
we
fetched
a
doctor
and
took
him
into
a
house
near
and
rubbed
him
and
did
all
we
could
but
it
was
of
no
good
at
all
shall
we
bring
him
in
a
bit
said
my
grandfather
must
tell
that
poor
girl
first
which
of
you
will
go
and
tell
her
the
men
looked
at
each
other
and
did
not
speak
at
last
one
of
them
who
knew
my
grandfather
a
little
said
better
tell
her
sandy
she
knows
you
and
she
bear
it
better
than
from
strangers
we
wait
here
till
you
come
back
and
then
we
can
bring
him
in
said
my
grandfather
with
a
groan
go
then
come
with
me
alick
my
lad
said
he
turning
to
me
no
perhaps
i
better
go
by
myself
so
he
went
very
slowly
up
towards
the
lighthouse
and
i
remained
behind
with
the
four
men
on
the
shore
and
that
silent
form
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
was
much
frightened
and
felt
as
if
it
was
all
a
very
terrible
dream
and
as
if
i
should
soon
wake
up
to
find
it
had
all
passed
away
chapter
ix
a
change
in
the
lighthouse
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
my
grandfather
came
back
and
then
he
only
said
in
a
low
voice
can
bring
him
now
my
lads
she
knows
about
it
now
and
so
the
mournful
little
procession
moved
on
through
the
field
and
garden
and
court
to
the
millars
house
my
grandfather
and
i
following
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
nor
the
strange
solemn
feeling
i
had
then
millar
was
very
ill
the
shock
had
been
too
much
for
her
the
men
went
back
in
the
boat
to
bring
a
doctor
to
the
island
to
see
her
and
the
doctor
sent
them
back
again
to
bring
a
nurse
he
said
he
was
afraid
she
would
have
an
attack
of
and
he
thought
her
very
ill
indeed
my
grandfather
and
i
sat
in
the
millars
house
all
night
for
the
nurse
did
not
arrive
until
early
in
the
morning
the
six
children
were
fast
asleep
in
their
little
beds
i
went
to
look
at
them
once
to
see
if
my
little
timpey
was
all
right
she
was
lying
in
little
polly
bed
their
tiny
hands
fast
clasped
together
as
they
slept
the
tears
came
fast
into
my
eyes
as
i
thought
that
they
both
had
lost
a
father
and
yet
neither
of
them
knew
anything
of
their
loss
when
the
nurse
arrived
my
grandfather
and
i
went
home
but
we
could
not
sleep
we
lighted
the
kitchen
fire
and
sat
over
it
in
silence
for
a
long
time
then
my
grandfather
said
my
lad
it
has
given
me
such
a
turn
as
i
have
had
for
many
a
day
it
might
have
been
alick
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
i
put
my
hand
in
his
and
grasped
it
very
tightly
as
he
said
this
he
said
again
might
have
been
me
and
if
it
had
i
wonder
where
i
should
have
been
now
i
did
speak
and
he
went
on
wonder
where
jem
is
now
poor
fellow
i
been
thinking
of
that
all
night
ever
since
i
saw
him
lying
there
at
the
bottom
of
that
boat
so
i
told
him
of
what
jem
millar
had
said
to
me
the
last
time
i
had
seen
him
the
rock
said
my
grandfather
did
he
say
he
was
on
the
rock
dear
me
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
alick
my
lad
you
and
i
come
as
he
came
grandfather
i
said
we
come
and
build
on
the
rock
too
said
my
grandfather
wish
we
could
my
lad
i
begin
to
see
what
he
meant
and
what
the
old
gentleman
meant
too
he
said
you
on
the
sand
my
friend
you
on
the
sand
and
it
wo
stand
the
storm
no
it
wo
stand
the
storm
i
just
had
those
words
in
my
ears
all
the
time
we
were
sitting
over
there
by
millar
but
dear
me
i
do
know
how
to
get
on
the
rock
i
do
indeed
the
whole
of
the
next
week
poor
millar
lay
between
life
and
death
at
first
the
doctor
gave
no
hope
whatever
of
her
recovery
but
after
a
time
she
grew
a
little
better
and
he
began
to
speak
more
encouragingly
i
spent
my
time
with
the
poor
children
and
hardly
left
them
a
moment
doing
all
i
could
to
keep
them
quietly
happy
that
they
might
not
disturb
their
mother
one
sorrowful
day
only
my
grandfather
and
i
were
absent
for
several
hours
from
the
lighthouse
for
we
went
ashore
to
follow
poor
jem
millar
to
the
grave
his
poor
wife
was
unconscious
and
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
when
after
some
weeks
the
fever
left
her
she
was
still
very
weak
and
unfit
for
work
but
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
she
had
no
time
to
sit
still
for
a
new
man
had
been
appointed
to
take
her
husband
place
and
he
was
to
come
into
the
house
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
we
felt
very
dull
and
sad
the
day
that
the
millars
went
away
we
went
down
to
the
pier
with
them
and
saw
them
on
board
the
steamer
millar
the
six
little
children
and
the
all
dressed
in
mourning
and
all
of
them
crying
they
were
going
to
millar
home
far
away
in
the
north
of
scotland
where
her
old
father
and
mother
were
still
living
the
island
seemed
very
lonely
and
desolate
when
they
were
gone
if
it
had
not
been
for
our
little
sunbeam
as
my
grandfather
called
her
i
do
not
know
what
we
should
have
done
every
day
we
loved
her
more
and
what
we
dreaded
most
was
that
a
letter
would
arrive
some
monday
morning
to
tell
us
that
she
must
go
away
from
us
me
alick
my
grandfather
would
often
say
little
you
and
me
thought
that
stormy
night
what
a
little
treasure
we
had
got
wrapped
up
in
that
funny
little
bundle
the
child
was
growing
fast
the
fresh
sea
did
her
great
good
and
every
day
she
became
more
intelligent
and
pretty
we
were
very
curious
to
know
who
was
appointed
in
jem
millar
place
but
we
were
not
able
to
find
out
even
what
his
name
was
captain
sayers
said
that
he
did
not
know
anything
about
it
and
the
gentlemen
who
came
over
once
or
twice
to
see
about
the
house
being
repaired
and
put
in
order
for
the
were
very
silent
on
the
subject
and
seemed
to
think
us
very
inquisitive
if
we
asked
any
questions
of
course
our
comfort
depended
very
much
upon
who
our
neighbour
was
for
he
and
my
grandfather
would
be
constantly
together
and
we
should
have
no
one
else
to
speak
to
my
grandfather
was
very
anxious
that
we
should
give
the
man
a
welcome
to
the
island
and
make
him
comfortable
on
his
first
arrival
so
we
set
to
work
as
soon
as
the
millars
were
gone
to
dig
up
the
untidy
garden
belonging
to
the
next
house
and
make
it
as
neat
and
pretty
as
we
could
for
the
wonder
how
many
of
them
there
will
be
i
said
as
we
were
at
work
in
their
garden
only
just
the
man
said
my
grandfather
i
came
here
first
i
was
a
young
unmarried
man
alick
but
we
shall
soon
know
all
about
him
he
be
here
next
monday
morning
they
say
a
wonder
he
has
been
over
before
i
said
see
the
house
and
the
island
i
wonder
what
he
think
of
it
be
strange
at
first
poor
fellow
said
my
grandfather
give
him
a
bit
of
a
welcome
have
a
nice
bit
of
breakfast
ready
for
him
alick
my
lad
and
for
his
wife
and
bairns
too
if

any
hot
coffee
and
cakes
and
a
bit
of
meat
and
any
thing
else
you
like
they
be
glad
of
it
after
crossing
over
here
so
we
made
our
little
preparations
and
waited
very
anxiously
indeed
for
monday

x
our
new
neighbour
monday

and
found
us

on
the
pier

were
very
anxious
indeed
to
see
our
new
neighbours
a
nice
little
breakfast
for
four
or
five
people

set
out
in
our
little
kitchen

i
had
gathered
a
large
bunch
of
dahlias
from
our
garden
to
make
the
table
look
cheerful
and
bright
all
was
ready
and
in
due
time
the
steamer
came
puffing
up
towards
the
pier
and
we
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
deck
talking
to
captain
sayers
who
we
felt
sure
must
be
the
new
illustration

merrily

we
were
walking
up
now
towards
the
house
and
the
man
did
not
seem
much
inclined
to
talk
i
fancied
once
that
i
saw
a
tear
in
his
eye
but
i
thought
i
must
have
been
mistaken
what
could
he
have
to
cry
about
i
little
knew
all
that
was
passing
through
his
mind
the
bye
said
my
grandfather
turning
round
suddenly
upon
him
your
name
we
never
heard
it
yet
the
man
did
not
answer
and
my
grandfather
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
you
got
no
name
he
said
have
you
objections
to
folks
knowing
what
your
name
is
said
the
man
taking
hold
of
my
grandfather
hand
you
know
your
own
lad
it
my
david
alick
look
alick
that
your
father
it
is
indeed
and
then
my
grandfather
fairly
broke
down
and
sobbed
like
a
child
whilst
my
father
grasped
him
tightly
with
one
hand
and
put
the
other
on
my
shoulder
would
let
them
tell
you
he
said
made
them
promise
not
to
tell
you
till
i
could
do
it
myself
i
heard
of
jem
millar
death
as
soon
as
i
arrived
in
england
and
i
wrote
off
and
applied
for
the
place
at
once
i
told
them
i
was
your
son
father
and
they
gave
me
it
at
once
as
soon
as
they
heard
where
i
had
been
all
these
years
where
have
you
been
david
never
to
send
us
a
line
all
the
time
it
a
long
story
said
my
father
come
in
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
so
we
went
in
together
and
my
father
still
looked
at
me
very
like
her
father
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
i
knew
he
meant
my
mother
you
heard
about
poor
alice
said
my
grandfather
he
said
was
a
very
curious
thing
a
man
from
these
parts
happened
to
be
on
board
the
vessel
i
came
home
in
and
he
told
me
all
about
it
i
felt
as
if
i
had
no
heart
left
in
me
when
i
heard
she
was
gone
i
had
just
been
thinking
all
the
time
how
glad
she
would
be
to
see
me
then
my
grandfather
told
him
all
he
could
about
my
poor
mother
how
she
had
longed
to
hear
from
him
and
how
as
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
went
by
and
no
news
came
she
had
gradually
become
weaker
and
weaker
all
this
and
much
more
he
told
him
and
whenever
he
stopped
my
father
always
wanted
to
hear
more
so
that
it
was
not
until
we
were
sitting
over
the
watchroom
fire
in
the
evening
that
my
father
began
to
tell
us
his
story
he
had
been
shipwrecked
on
the
coast
of
china
the
ship
had
gone
to
pieces
not
far
from
shore
and
he
and
three
other
men
had
escaped
safely
to
land
as
soon
as
they
stepped
on
shore
a
crowd
of
chinese
gathered
round
them
with
anything
but
friendly
faces
they
were
taken
prisoners
and
carried
before
some
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
governor
of
that
part
of
the
country
he
asked
them
a
great
many
questions
but
they
did
not
understand
a
word
of
what
he
said
and
of
course
could
not
answer
him
for
some
days
my
father
and
the
other
men
were
very
uncertain
what
their
fate
would
be
for
the
chinese
at
that
time
were
exceedingly
jealous
of
any
foreigner
landing
on
their
shore
however
one
day
they
were
brought
out
of
the
wooden
house
in
which
they
had
been
imprisoned
and
taken
a
long
journey
of
some
two
hundred
miles
into
the
interior
of
the
country
and
here
it
was
that
my
poor
father
had
been
all
those
years
when
we
thought
him
dead
he
was
not
unkindly
treated
and
he
taught
the
people
there
many
things
which
they
did
not
know
and
which
they
were
very
glad
to
learn
but
both
by
day
and
night
he
was
carefully
watched
lest
he
should
make
his
escape
and
he
never
found
a
single
opportunity
of
getting
away
from
them
of
course
there
were
no
posts
and
no
railways
in
that
remote
place
and
he
was
quite
shut
out
from
the
world
of
what
was
going
on
at
home
he
knew
as
little
as
if
he
had
been
living
in
the
moon
slowly
and
drearily
eleven
long
years
passed
away
and
then
one
morning
they
were
suddenly
told
that
they
were
to
be
sent
down
to
the
coast
and
put
on
board
a
ship
bound
for
england
they
told
my
father
that
there
had
been
a
war
and
that
one
of
the
conditions
of
peace
was
that
they
should
give
up
all
the
foreigners
in
their
country
whom
they
were
holding
as
prisoners
david
my
lad
said
my
grandfather
when
he
had
finished
his
strange
story
almost
like
getting
thee
back
from
the
dead
to
have
thee
in
the
old
home
again
chapter
xi
on
the
rock
about
a
fortnight
after
my
father
arrived
we
were
surprised
one
monday
morning
by
another
visit
from
old
davis
his
had
asked
him
to
come
to
tell
my
grandfather
that
he
had
received
a
letter
with
regard
to
the
little
girl
who
was
saved
from
the
so
he
told
my
father
and
me
as
we
stood
on
the
pier
and
all
the
way
to
the
house
i
was
wondering
what
the
letter
could
be
timpey
was
running
by
my
side
her
little
hand
in
mine
and
i
could
not
bear
to
think
how
dull
we
should
be
when
she
was
gone
it
surely
davis
said
my
grandfather
as
he
rose
to
meet
the
old
gentleman
said
he
is
davis
and
i
suppose
you
can
guess
what
come
for
to
take
our
little
sunbeam
sir
said
my
grandfather
taking
timpey
in
his
arms
never
mean
to
say
you
going
to
take
her
away
a
bit
said
the
old
gentleman
sitting
down
and
fumbling
in
his
pocket
until
you
heard
this
letter
and
then
see
what
you
think
about
her
going
and
he
began
to
read
as
follows
my
dear
sir
i
am
almost
over
powered
with
joy
by
the
news
received
by
telegram
an
hour
ago
we
had
heard
of
the
loss
of
the
and
were
mourning
for
our
little
darling
as
being
amongst
the
number
of
those
drowned
her
mother
has
been
quite
crushed
by
her
loss
and
has
been
dangerously
ill
ever
since
the
sad
intelligence
reached
us
i
tell
you
what
our
feelings
were
when
we
suddenly
heard
that
our
dear
child
was
alive
and
well
and
happy
shall
sail
by
the
next
steamer
for
england
to
claim
our
little
darling
my
wife
is
hardly
strong
enough
to
travel
this
week
or
we
should
come
at
once
a
thousand
thanks
to
the
brave
men
who
saved
our
little
girl
i
shall
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
thank
them
myself
my
heart
is
too
full
to
write
much
child
was
travelling
home
under
the
care
of
a
friend
as
we
wished
her
to
leave
india
before
the
hot
weather
set
in
and
i
was
not
able
to
leave
for
two
months
this
accounts
for
the
name
villiers
not
being
on
the
list
of
passengers
on
board
the
you
most
sincerely
for
all
your
efforts
to
let
us
know
of
our
child
safety
remain
yours
very
truly
villiers
said
the
old
gentleman
looking
at
me
and
laughing
though
i
saw
a
tear
in
his
eye
you
let
them
have
her
to
be
sure
said
my
grandfather
can
one
say
after
that
poor
things
how
pleased
they
are
i
said
taking
the
little
girl
on
my
knee
do
you
think
is
coming
to
see
you
your
mother
is
coming
coming
to
see
little
timpey
the
child
looked
earnestly
at
me
she
evidently
had
not
quite
forgotten
the
name
she
opened
her
blue
eyes
wider
than
usual
and
looked
very
thoughtful
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
nodded
her
head
very
wisely
and
said
mother
coming
to
see
timpey
her
said
the
old
gentleman
stroking
her
fair
little
head
seems
to
know
all
about
it
then
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
and
whilst
we
were
eating
it
old
davis
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
i
had
read
the
little
piece
of
paper
sir
said
my
grandfather
we
have
read
it
and
he
told
him
about
jem
millar
and
what
he
had
said
to
me
that
last
morning
now
said
my
grandfather
wish
if
you
be
so
kind
you
would
tell
me
to
get
on
the
for
i
on
the
sand
now
there
no
doubt
at
all
about
it
and
i
afraid
as
you
said
the
last
time
you
were
here
that
it
wo
stand
the
storm
would
be
a
sad
thing
said
old
davis
be
on
the
sand
when
the
great
storm
comes
sir
it
would
said
my
grandfather
often
lie
in
bed
at
nights
and
think
of
it
when
the
winds
and
the
waves
are
raging
i
call
to
mind
that
verse
where
it
says
about
the
sea
and
the
waves
roaring
and
hearts
failing
them
for
fear
deary
me
i
should
be
terrible
frightened
that
i
should
if
that
day
was
to
come
and
i
saw
the
lord
coming
in
glory
you
need
not
be
afraid
if
you
are
on
the
rock
said
our
old
friend
who
have
come
to
christ
and
are
resting
on
him
will
feel
as
safe
in
that
day
as
you
do
when
there
is
a
storm
raging
and
you
are
inside
this
house
said
my
grandfather
see
that
sir
but
somehow
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
getting
on
the
rock
i
do
quite
see
it
sir
said
davis
would
you
do
if
this
house
was
built
on
the
sand
down
there
by
the
shore
and
you
knew
that
the
very
first
storm
that
came
would
sweep
it
away
sir
said
my
grandfather
i
should
pull
it
down
every
stone
of
it
and
build
it
up
on
the
rock
instead
said
davis
have
been
building
your
hopes
of
heaven
on
the
sand
on
your
good
deeds
on
your
good
intentions
on
all
sorts
of
you
know
you
have
said
grandfather
know
i
have
my
friend
said
davis
them
all
down
say
to
yourself
i
a
lost
man
if
i
remain
as
i
am
my
hopes
are
all
resting
on
the
sand
and
then
build
your
hopes
on
something
better
something
which
stand
the
storm
build
them
on
christ
he
is
the
only
way
to
heaven
he
has
died
that
you
a
poor
sinner
might
go
there
build
your
hopes
on
him
my
friend
trust
to
what
he
has
done
for
you
as
your
only
hope
of
heaven
is
building
on
the
rock
see
sir
i
understand
you
now
that
said
davis
then
your
hope
will
be
a
sure
and
steadfast
hope
a
good
hope
which
can
never
be
moved
and
when
the
last
great
storm
comes
it
will
not
touch
you
you
will
be
as
certainly
and
as
entirely
safe
in
that
day
as
you
are
in
this
lighthouse
when
the
storm
is
raging
outside
because
you
will
be
built
upon
the
immovable
rock
i
can
not
recollect
all
the
conversation
which
davis
and
my
grandfather
had
that
morning
but
i
do
remember
that
before
he
went
away
he
knelt
down
with
us
and
prayed
that
we
might
every
one
of
us
be
found
on
the
rock
in
that
last
great
storm
and
i
remember
also
that
that
night
when
my
grandfather
said
to
me
he
said
my
lad
i
do
mean
to
go
to
sleep
till
i
can
say
like
poor
jem
millar
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
and
i
believe
that
my
grandfather
kept
his
word
chapter
xii
the
sunbeam
claimed
it
was
a
cold
cheerless
morning
the
wind
was
blowing
and
the
rain
was
beating
against
the
windows
it
was
far
too
wet
and
stormy
for
little
timpey
to
be
out
so
she
and
i
had
a
game
of
ball
together
in
the
kitchen
whilst
my
father
and
grandfather
went
down
to
the
pier
she
looked
such
a
pretty
little
thing
that
morning
she
had
on
a
little
blue
frock
which
my
grandfather
had
bought
for
her
and
which
millar
had
made
before
she
left
the
island
and
a
clean
white
pinafore
she
was
screaming
with
delight
as
i
threw
the
ball
over
her
head
and
she
ran
to
catch
it
when
the
door
opened
and
my
father
ran
in
is
she
here
they
come
come
father
i
said
timpey
father
and
mother
they
are
coming
up
the
garden
now
with
your
grandfather
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
before
my
grandfather
came
in
with
a
lady
and
gentleman
the
lady
ran
forward
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
child
put
her
arms
round
her
and
held
her
tightly
in
her
bosom
as
if
she
could
never
part
from
her
again
then
she
sat
down
with
her
little
darling
on
her
knee
stroking
her
tiny
hands
and
talking
to
her
and
looking
oh
so
anxiously
to
see
if
the
child
remembered
her
at
first
timpey
looked
a
little
shy
and
hung
down
her
head
and
would
not
look
in
her
mother
face
but
this
was
only
for
a
minute
as
soon
as
her
mother
to
her
she
evidently
remembered
her
voice
and
when
villiers
asked
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
you
know
me
little
timpey
my
dear
little
timpey
who
am
i
the
child
looked
up
and
smiled
as
she
said
mother
timpey
dear
mother
and
she
put
up
her
little
fat
hand
to
stroke
her
mother
face
and
then
when
i
saw
that
i
could
feel
no
longer
sorry
that
the
child
was
going
away
i
can
well
remember
what
a
happy
morning
that
was
and
villiers
were
so
kind
to
us
and
so
very
grateful
for
all
that
my
grandfather
and
i
had
done
for
their
little
girl
they
thought
her
looking
so
much
better
and
stronger
than
when
she
left
india
and
they
were
so
pleased
to
find
that
she
had
not
forgotten
all
the
little
lessons
she
had
learnt
at
home
villiers
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
the
child
wherever
little
timpey
went
and
whatever
she
was
doing
her
mother
followed
her
and
i
shall
never
forget
how
happy
and
how
glad
both
the
father
and
the
mother
looked
but
the
most
pleasant
day
will
come
to
an
end
and
in
the
evening
a
boat
was
to
come
from
shore
to
take
and
villiers
and
their
child
away
me
said
my
grandfather
with
a
groan
as
he
took
the
little
girl
on
his
knee
never
felt
so
sorry
to
lose
anybody
i
sure
i
did
why
i
calls
her
my
little
sunbeam
sir
you
excuse
me
saying
so
but
i
do
feel
over
and
above
kindly
to
you
for
taking
her
away
from
me
i
do
indeed
sir
i
do
know
what
you
will
say
to
me
when
you
hear
i
want
to
rob
you
further
said
villiers
me
further
repeated
my
grandfather
said
villiers
putting
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
want
to
take
this
grandson
of
yours
away
too
it
seems
to
me
a
great
pity
that
such
a
fine
lad
should
waste
his
days
shut
up
on
this
little
island
let
him
come
with
me
and
i
will
send
him
to
a
really
good
school
for
three
or
four
years
and
then
i
will
get
him
some
good
clerkship
or
something
of
that
kind
and
put
him
in
the
way
of
making
his
way
in
the
world
now
then
my
friend
will
you
and
his
father
spare
him
said
my
grandfather
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
sir
it
very
good
of
you
very
good
indeed
it
is
and
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
alick
it
would
indeed
but
i
always
thought
he
would
take
my
place
here
when
i
was
dead
said
my
father
you
see
shall
be
here
to
do
that
father
and
if
villiers
is
so
very
kind
as
to
take
alick
i
sure
we
ought
only
to
be
too
glad
for
him
to
have
such
a
friend
right
david
yes
your
right
we
must
be
selfish
sir
and
you
let
him
come
and
see
us
sometimes
would
you
to
be
sure
said
villiers
can
come
and
spend
his
holidays
here
and
give
you
fine
histories
of
his
school
life
now
alick
what
say
you
there
a
capital
school
in
the
town
where
we
are
going
to
live
so
you
would
be
near
us
and
you
could
come
to
see
us
on
holiday
afternoons
and
see
whether
this
little
woman
remembers
all
you
have
taught
her
what
say
you
i
was
very
pleased
indeed
and
very
thankful
for
his
kindness
and
my
father
and
grandfather
said
they
would
never
be
able
to
repay
him
said
villiers
my
friends
it
who
can
never
repay
just
think
for
one
moment
of
what
you
have
given
me
and
he
put
his
arm
round
his
little
girl
neck
so
we
may
consider
that
matter
settled
and
now
when
can
alick
come
my
grandfather
begged
for
another
month
and
villiers
said
that
would
do
very
well
as
in
that
time
the
school
would
reopen
after
the
holidays
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
i
said
to
little
timpey
that
afternoon
it
was
with
the
hope
of
soon
seeing
her
again
her
father
called
her
lucy
which
i
found
was
her
real
name
timpey
was
a
pet
name
which
had
been
given
her
as
a
baby
but
though
lucy
was
certainly
a
prettier
name
still
i
felt
i
should
always
think
of
her
as
timpey
little
timpey
i
shall
never
forget
my
feelings
that
month
a
strange
new
life
was
opening
out
before
me
and
i
felt
quite
bewildered
by
the
prospect
my
grandfather
and
father
and
i
sat
over
the
watchroom
fire
night
after
night
talking
over
my
future
and
day
after
day
i
wandered
over
our
dear
little
island
wondering
how
i
should
feel
when
i
said
to
it
and
went
into
the
great
world
beyond
since
old
davis
visit
there
had
been
a
great
change
in
our
little
home
the
great
bible
had
been
taken
down
from
its
place
and
carefully
read
and
studied
and
sunday
was
no
longer
spent
by
us
like
any
other
day
but
was
kept
as
well
as
it
could
be
on
that
lonely
island
my
grandfather
i
felt
sure
was
a
new
man
old
things
had
passed
away
all
things
had
become
new
he
was
dearer
to
me
than
ever
and
i
felt
very
sorrowful
when
i
thought
of
parting
from
him
could
never
have
left
you
grandfather
i
said
one
day
my
father
had
not
been
here
he
said
do
think
i
could
have
spared
you
alick
but
your
father
just
came
back
in
right
time
did
you
david
at
last
the
day
arrived
on
which
villiers
had
appointed
to
meet
me
at
the
town
to
which
the
steamer
went
every
monday
morning
when
it
left
the
island
my
father
and
grandfather
walked
with
me
down
to
the
pier
and
saw
me
on
board
and
the
very
last
thing
my
grandfather
said
to
me
was
my
lad
keep
on
the
rock
be
sure
you
keep
on
the
rock
and
i
trust
that
i
have
never
forgotten
my
grandfather
last
words
to
me
was
founded
upon
a
rock
matt
vii
my
hope
is
built
on
nothing
less
than
jesu
blood
and
righteousness
i
dare
not
trust
the
sweetest
frame
but
wholly
lean
on
jesu
name
on
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
when
long
appears
my
toilsome
race
i
rest
on
his
unchanging
grace
in
every
high
and
stormy
gale
my
anchor
holds
within
the
veil
on
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
his
oath
his
covenant
and
blood
support
me
in
the
whelming
flood
when
every
earthly
prop
gives
way
he
then
is
all
my
hope
and
stay
on
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
when
the
last
trumpet
voice
shall
sound
oh
may
i
then
in
him
be
found
robed
in
his
righteousness
alone
faultless
to
stand
before
the
throne
on
christ
the
solid
rock
i
stand
all
other
ground
is
sinking
sand
mote
