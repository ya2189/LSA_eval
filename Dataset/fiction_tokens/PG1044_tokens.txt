chapter
i
well
when
i
had
been
dead
about
thirty
years
i
begun
to
get
a
little
anxious
mind
you
had
been
whizzing
through
space
all
that
time
like
a
comet
a
comet
why
peters
i
laid
over
the
lot
of
them
of
course
there
any
of
them
going
my
way
as
a
steady
thing
you
know
because
they
travel
in
a
long
circle
like
the
loop
of
a
lasso
whereas
i
was
pointed
as
straight
as
a
dart
for
the
hereafter
but
i
happened
on
one
every
now
and
then
that
was
going
my
way
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
we
had
a
bit
of
a
brush
together
but
it
was
generally
pretty
because
i
sailed
by
them
the
same
as
if
they
were
standing
still
an
ordinary
comet
make
more
than
about
miles
a
minute
of
course
when
i
came
across
one
of
that
and
comets
for
anything
but
just
a
flash
and
a
vanish
you
see
you
rightly
call
it
a
race
it
was
as
if
the
comet
was
a
and
i
was
a
telegraph
despatch
but
after
i
got
outside
of
our
astronomical
system
i
used
to
flush
a
comet
occasionally
that
was
something
got
any
such
begin
one
night
i
was
swinging
along
at
a
good
round
gait
everything
taut
and
trim
and
the
wind
in
my
judged
i
was
going
about
a
million
miles
a
might
have
been
more
it
have
been
i
flushed
a
most
uncommonly
big
one
about
three
points
off
my
starboard
bow
by
his
stern
lights
i
judged
he
was
bearing
about
well
it
was
so
near
my
course
that
i
throw
away
the
chance
so
i
fell
off
a
point
steadied
my
helm
and
went
for
him
you
should
have
heard
me
whiz
and
seen
the
electric
fur
fly
in
about
a
minute
and
a
half
i
was
fringed
out
with
an
electrical
nimbus
that
flamed
around
for
miles
and
miles
and
lit
up
all
space
like
broad
day
the
comet
was
burning
blue
in
the
distance
like
a
sickly
torch
when
i
first
sighted
him
but
he
begun
to
grow
bigger
and
bigger
as
i
crept
up
on
him
i
slipped
up
on
him
so
fast
that
when
i
had
gone
about
miles
i
was
close
enough
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
phosphorescent
glory
of
his
wake
and
i
see
anything
for
the
glare
thinks
i
it
do
to
run
into
him
so
i
shunted
to
one
side
and
tore
along
by
and
by
i
closed
up
abreast
of
his
tail
do
you
know
what
it
was
like
it
was
like
a
gnat
closing
up
on
the
continent
of
america
i
forged
along
by
and
by
i
had
sailed
along
his
coast
for
a
little
upwards
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
million
miles
and
then
i
could
see
by
the
shape
of
him
that
i
even
got
up
to
his
waistband
yet
why
peters
know
anything
about
comets
down
here
if
you
want
to
see
comets
that
comets
got
to
go
outside
of
our
solar
room
for
them
you
understand
my
friend
seen
comets
out
there
that
even
lay
down
inside
the
of
our
noblest
comets
without
their
tails
hanging
over
well
i
boomed
along
another
hundred
and
fifty
million
miles
and
got
up
abreast
his
shoulder
as
you
may
say
i
was
feeling
pretty
fine
i
tell
you
but
just
then
i
noticed
the
officer
of
the
deck
come
to
the
side
and
hoist
his
glass
in
my
direction
straight
off
i
heard
him
sing
there
ahoy
shake
her
up
shake
her
up
heave
on
a
hundred
million
billion
tons
of
brimstone
sir
the
stabboard
watch
all
hands
on
deck
sir
two
hundred
thousand
million
men
aloft
to
shake
out
royals
and
sir
the
hang
out
every
rag
got
clothe
her
from
stem
to
sir
in
about
a
second
i
begun
to
see
woke
up
a
pretty
ugly
customer
peters
in
less
than
ten
seconds
that
comet
was
just
a
blazing
cloud
of
canvas
it
was
piled
up
into
the
heavens
clean
out
of
old
thing
seemed
to
swell
out
and
occupy
all
space
the
sulphur
smoke
from
the
well
nobody
can
describe
the
way
it
rolled
and
tumbled
up
into
the
skies
and
nobody
can
half
describe
the
way
it
smelt
neither
can
anybody
begin
to
describe
the
way
that
monstrous
craft
begun
to
crash
along
and
such
another
of
whistles
screaming
at
once
and
a
crew
like
the
populations
of
a
hundred
thousand
worlds
like
ours
all
swearing
at
once
well
i
never
heard
the
like
of
it
before
we
roared
and
thundered
along
side
by
side
both
doing
our
level
best
because
never
struck
a
comet
before
that
could
lay
over
me
and
so
i
was
bound
to
beat
this
one
or
break
something
i
judged
i
had
some
reputation
in
space
and
i
calculated
to
keep
it
i
noticed
i
gaining
as
fast
now
as
i
was
before
but
still
i
was
gaining
there
was
a
power
of
excitement
on
board
the
comet
upwards
of
a
hundred
billion
passengers
swarmed
up
from
below
and
rushed
to
the
side
and
begun
to
bet
on
the
race
of
course
this
careened
her
and
damaged
her
speed
my
but
the
mate
mad
he
jumped
at
that
crowd
with
his
trumpet
in
his
hand
and
sung
amidships
or
brain
the
last
idiot
of
you
well
sir
i
gained
and
gained
little
by
little
till
at
last
i
went
skimming
sweetly
by
the
magnificent
old
nose
by
this
time
the
captain
of
the
comet
had
been
rousted
out
and
he
stood
there
in
the
red
glare
by
the
mate
in
his
and
slippers
his
hair
all
nests
and
one
suspender
hanging
and
how
sick
those
two
men
did
look
i
just
simply
help
putting
my
thumb
to
my
nose
as
i
glided
away
and
singing
out
any
word
to
send
to
your
family
peters
it
was
a
mistake
yes
sir
often
regretted
was
a
mistake
you
see
the
captain
had
given
up
the
race
but
that
remark
was
too
tedious
for
stand
it
he
turned
to
the
mate
and
says
we
got
brimstone
enough
of
our
own
to
make
the
trip
than
much
have
we
got
in
cargo
for
satan
hundred
thousand
billion
quintillions
of
well
then
let
his
boarders
freeze
till
the
next
comet
comes
lighten
ship
lively
now
lively
men
heave
the
whole
cargo
overboard
peters
look
me
in
the
eye
and
be
calm
i
found
out
over
there
that
a
kazark
is
exactly
the
bulk
of
a
and
worlds
like
they
hove
all
that
load
overboard
when
it
fell
it
wiped
out
a
considerable
raft
of
stars
just
as
clean
as
if
been
candles
and
somebody
blowed
them
out
as
for
the
race
that
was
at
an
end
the
minute
she
was
lightened
the
comet
swung
along
by
me
the
same
as
if
i
was
anchored
the
captain
stood
on
the
stern
by
the
and
put
his
thumb
to
his
nose
and
sung
maybe
got
some
message
to
send
your
friends
in
the
everlasting
tropics
then
he
hove
up
his
other
suspender
and
started
and
inside
of
of
an
hour
his
craft
was
only
a
pale
torch
again
in
the
distance
yes
it
was
a
mistake
remark
of
mine
i
reckon
ever
get
over
being
sorry
about
it
beat
the
bully
of
the
firmament
if
kept
my
mouth
shut
but
wandered
a
little
off
the
track
of
my
tale
get
back
on
my
course
again
now
you
see
what
kind
of
speed
i
was
making
so
as
i
said
when
i
had
been
tearing
along
this
way
about
thirty
years
i
begun
to
get
uneasy
oh
it
was
pleasant
enough
with
a
good
deal
to
find
out
but
then
it
was
kind
of
lonesome
you
know
besides
i
wanted
to
get
somewhere
i
shipped
with
the
idea
of
cruising
forever
first
off
i
liked
the
delay
because
i
judged
i
was
going
to
fetch
up
in
pretty
warm
quarters
when
i
got
through
but
towards
the
last
i
begun
to
feel
that
rather
go
most
any
place
so
as
to
finish
up
the
uncertainty
well
one
was
always
night
except
when
i
was
rushing
by
some
star
that
was
occupying
the
whole
universe
with
its
fire
and
its
enough
then
of
course
but
i
necessarily
left
it
behind
in
a
minute
or
two
and
plunged
into
a
solid
week
of
darkness
again
the
stars
so
close
together
as
they
look
to
be
where
was
i
oh
yes
one
night
i
was
sailing
along
when
i
discovered
a
tremendous
long
row
of
blinking
lights
away
on
the
horizon
ahead
as
i
approached
they
begun
to
tower
and
swell
and
look
like
mighty
furnaces
says
i
to
george
arrived
at
at
the
wrong
place
just
as
i
expected
then
i
fainted
i
know
how
long
i
was
insensible
but
it
must
have
been
a
good
while
for
when
i
came
to
the
darkness
was
all
gone
and
there
was
the
loveliest
sunshine
and
the
balmiest
fragrantest
air
in
its
place
and
there
was
such
a
marvellous
world
spread
out
before
a
glowing
beautiful
bewitching
country
the
things
i
took
for
furnaces
were
gates
miles
high
made
all
of
flashing
jewels
and
they
pierced
a
wall
of
solid
gold
that
you
see
the
top
of
nor
yet
the
end
of
in
either
direction
i
was
pointed
straight
for
one
of
these
gates
and
like
a
house
afire
now
i
noticed
that
the
skies
were
black
with
millions
of
people
pointed
for
those
gates
what
a
roar
they
made
rushing
through
the
air
the
ground
was
as
thick
as
ants
with
people
of
them
i
judge
i
lit
i
drifted
up
to
a
gate
with
a
swarm
of
people
and
when
it
was
my
turn
the
head
clerk
says
in
a
quick
where
are
you
from
francisco
says
i
says
he
he
scratched
his
head
and
looked
puzzled
then
he
it
a
planet
by
george
peters
think
of
it
says
i
a
city
and
moreover
one
of
the
biggest
and
finest
there
says
he
time
here
for
conversation
we
deal
in
cities
here
where
are
you
from
in
a
way
i
says
beg
your
pardon
put
me
down
for
i
had
him
peters
he
puzzled
a
second
then
he
says
sharp
and
know
any
such
it
a
constellation
my
goodness
says
i
says
you
a
we
deal
in
states
here
you
tell
me
where
you
are
from
you
understand
now
i
get
your
idea
i
says
from
america
united
states
of
peters
do
you
know
i
had
him
if
i
a
clam
his
face
was
as
blank
as
a
target
after
a
militia
he
turned
to
an
under
clerk
and
is
america
is
america
the
under
clerk
answered
up
prompt
and
any
such
says
i
what
are
you
talking
about
young
man
it
an
orb
a
country
a
continent
columbus
discovered
it
i
reckon
likely
heard
of
anyway
sir
says
the
head
clerk
for
all
says
i
know
anything
more
to
i
lump
things
and
just
say
from
the
says
he
brightening
up
something
like
world
peters
he
had
that
time
i
looked
at
him
puzzled
he
looked
at
me
worried
then
he
burst
come
what
world
says
i
world
of
world
he
says
billions
of
them
next
that
meant
for
me
to
stand
aside
i
done
so
and
a
man
with
seven
heads
and
only
one
leg
hopped
into
my
place
i
took
a
walk
it
just
occurred
to
me
then
that
all
the
myriads
i
had
seen
swarming
to
that
gate
up
to
this
time
were
just
like
that
creature
i
tried
to
run
across
somebody
i
was
acquainted
with
but
they
were
out
of
acquaintances
of
mine
just
then
so
i
thought
the
thing
all
over
and
finally
sidled
back
there
pretty
meek
and
feeling
rather
stumped
as
you
may
say
said
the
head
clerk
sir
i
says
pretty
humble
seem
to
make
out
which
world
it
is
from
but
you
may
know
it
from
the
one
the
saviour
he
bent
his
head
at
the
name
then
he
says
worlds
he
has
saved
are
like
to
the
gates
of
heaven
in
can
count
them
what
astronomical
system
is
your
world
in
that
may
the
one
that
has
the
sun
in
the
shook
his
head
at
each
ever
heard
of
them
you
on
says
on
a
minute
jupiter
jupiter
seems
to
me
we
had
a
man
from
there
eight
or
nine
hundred
years
people
from
that
system
very
seldom
enter
by
this
all
of
a
sudden
he
begun
to
look
me
so
straight
in
the
eye
that
i
thought
he
was
going
to
bore
through
me
then
he
says
very
deliberate
you
come
from
your
system
sir
i
i
blushed
the
least
little
bit
in
the
world
when
i
said
it
he
looked
at
me
very
stern
and
is
not
true
and
this
is
not
the
place
for
prevarication
you
wandered
from
your
course
how
did
that
happen
says
i
blushing
sorry
and
i
take
back
what
i
said
and
confess
i
raced
a
little
with
a
comet
one
just
the
least
little
the
tiniest
says
without
any
sugar
in
his
voice
to
speak
of
i
went
on
and
i
only
fell
off
just
a
bare
point
and
i
went
right
back
on
my
course
again
the
minute
the
race
was
divergence
has
made
all
this
trouble
it
has
brought
you
to
a
gate
that
is
billions
of
leagues
from
the
right
one
if
you
had
gone
to
your
own
gate
they
would
have
known
all
about
your
world
at
once
and
there
would
have
been
no
delay
but
we
will
try
to
accommodate
he
turned
to
an
under
clerk
and
system
is
jupiter
in
remember
sir
but
i
think
there
is
such
a
planet
in
one
of
the
little
new
systems
away
out
in
one
of
the
thinly
worlded
corners
of
the
universe
i
will
he
got
a
balloon
and
sailed
up
and
up
and
up
in
front
of
a
map
that
was
as
big
as
rhode
island
he
went
on
up
till
he
was
out
of
sight
and
by
and
by
he
came
down
and
got
something
to
eat
and
went
up
again
to
cut
a
long
story
short
he
kept
on
doing
this
for
a
day
or
two
and
finally
he
came
down
and
said
he
thought
he
had
found
that
solar
system
but
it
might
be
so
he
got
a
microscope
and
went
back
it
turned
out
better
than
he
feared
he
had
rousted
out
our
system
sure
enough
he
got
me
to
describe
our
planet
and
its
distance
from
the
sun
and
then
he
says
to
his
i
know
the
one
he
means
now
sir
it
is
on
the
map
it
is
called
the
says
i
to
myself
man
it
be
wholesome
for
you
to
go
down
and
call
it
the
well
they
let
me
in
then
and
told
me
i
was
safe
forever
and
have
any
more
trouble
then
they
turned
from
me
and
went
on
with
their
work
the
same
as
if
they
considered
my
case
all
complete
and
shipshape
i
was
a
good
deal
surprised
at
this
but
i
was
diffident
about
speaking
up
and
reminding
them
i
did
so
hate
to
do
it
you
know
it
seemed
a
pity
to
bother
them
they
had
so
much
on
their
hands
twice
i
thought
i
would
give
up
and
let
the
thing
go
so
twice
i
started
to
leave
but
immediately
i
thought
what
a
figure
i
should
cut
stepping
out
amongst
the
redeemed
in
such
a
rig
and
that
made
me
hang
back
and
come
to
anchor
again
people
got
to
eying
you
why
i
get
under
way
i
stand
this
was
too
uncomfortable
so
at
last
i
plucked
up
courage
and
tipped
the
head
clerk
a
signal
he
you
here
yet
wanting
says
i
in
a
low
voice
and
very
confidential
making
a
trumpet
with
my
hands
at
his
beg
pardon
and
you
mind
my
reminding
you
and
seeming
to
meddle
but
you
forgot
something
he
studied
a
second
and
something
no
not
that
i
know
says
i
he
thought
then
he
i
seem
to
have
forgot
anything
what
is
it
at
me
says
i
me
all
he
done
it
says
he
says
i
notice
anything
if
i
branched
out
amongst
the
elect
looking
like
this
i
attract
considerable
attention
i
be
a
little
conspicuous
he
says
see
anything
the
matter
what
do
you
lack
why
i
lack
my
harp
and
my
wreath
and
my
halo
and
my
and
my
palm
lack
everything
that
a
body
naturally
requires
up
here
my
puzzled
peters
he
was
the
worst
puzzled
man
you
ever
saw
finally
he
you
seem
to
be
a
curiosity
every
way
a
body
takes
you
i
never
heard
of
these
things
i
looked
at
the
man
awhile
in
solid
astonishment
then
i
i
hope
you
take
it
as
an
offence
for
i
mean
any
but
really
for
a
man
that
has
been
in
the
kingdom
as
long
as
i
reckon
you
have
you
do
seem
to
know
powerful
little
about
its
customs
says
he
is
a
large
place
good
friend
large
empires
have
many
and
diverse
customs
even
small
dominions
have
as
you
doubtless
know
by
what
you
have
seen
of
the
matter
on
a
small
scale
in
the
wart
how
can
you
imagine
i
could
ever
learn
the
varied
customs
of
the
countless
kingdoms
of
heaven
it
makes
my
head
ache
to
think
of
it
i
know
the
customs
that
prevail
in
those
portions
inhabited
by
peoples
that
are
appointed
to
enter
by
my
own
hark
ye
that
is
quite
enough
knowledge
for
one
individual
to
try
to
pack
into
his
head
in
the
millions
of
years
i
have
devoted
night
and
day
to
that
study
but
the
idea
of
learning
the
customs
of
the
whole
appalling
expanse
of
man
how
insanely
you
talk
now
i
doubt
that
this
odd
costume
you
talk
about
is
the
fashion
in
that
district
of
heaven
you
belong
to
but
you
be
conspicuous
in
this
section
without
i
felt
all
right
if
that
was
the
case
so
i
bade
him
and
left
all
day
i
walked
towards
the
far
end
of
a
prodigious
hall
of
the
office
hoping
to
come
out
into
heaven
any
moment
but
it
was
a
mistake
that
hall
was
built
on
the
general
heavenly
naturally
be
small
at
last
i
got
so
tired
i
go
any
farther
so
i
sat
down
to
rest
and
begun
to
tackle
the
queerest
sort
of
strangers
and
ask
for
information
but
i
get
any
they
understand
my
language
and
i
could
not
understand
theirs
i
got
dreadfully
lonesome
i
was
so
and
homesick
i
wished
a
hundred
times
i
never
had
died
i
turned
back
of
course
about
noon
next
day
i
got
back
at
last
and
was
on
hand
at
the
once
more
says
i
to
the
head
begin
to
see
that
a
got
to
be
in
his
own
heaven
to
be
correct
says
he
you
imagine
the
same
heaven
would
suit
all
sorts
of
men
i
had
that
i
see
the
foolishness
of
it
which
way
am
i
to
go
to
get
to
my
district
he
called
the
under
clerk
that
had
examined
the
map
and
he
gave
me
general
directions
i
thanked
him
and
started
but
he
a
minute
it
is
millions
of
leagues
from
here
go
outside
and
stand
on
that
red
shut
your
eyes
hold
your
breath
and
wish
yourself
much
obliged
says
i
you
dart
me
through
when
i
first
arrived
have
a
good
deal
to
think
of
here
it
was
your
place
to
think
of
it
and
ask
for
it
we
probably
see
you
in
this
region
for
a
thousand
centuries
or
that
case
says
i
hopped
onto
the
carpet
and
held
my
breath
and
shut
my
eyes
and
wished
i
was
in
the
of
my
own
section
the
very
next
instant
a
voice
i
knew
sung
out
in
a
business
kind
of
a
harp
and
a
pair
of
wings
and
a
halo
size
for
eli
stormfield
of
san
francisco
him
out
a
clean
bill
of
health
and
let
him
i
opened
my
eyes
sure
enough
it
was
a
pi
ute
injun
i
used
to
know
in
tulare
county
mighty
good
remembered
being
at
his
funeral
which
consisted
of
him
being
burnt
and
the
other
injuns
gauming
their
faces
with
his
ashes
and
howling
like
wildcats
he
was
powerful
glad
to
see
me
and
you
may
make
up
your
mind
i
was
just
as
glad
to
see
him
and
feel
that
i
was
in
the
right
kind
of
a
heaven
at
last
just
as
far
as
your
eye
could
reach
there
was
swarms
of
clerks
running
and
bustling
around
tricking
out
thousands
of
yanks
and
mexicans
and
english
and
arabs
and
all
sorts
of
people
in
their
new
outfits
and
when
they
gave
me
my
kit
and
i
put
on
my
halo
and
took
a
look
in
the
glass
i
could
have
jumped
over
a
house
for
joy
i
was
so
happy
is
something
like
says
i
says
i
all
me
a
inside
of
fifteen
minutes
i
was
a
mile
on
my
way
towards
the
and
about
a
million
people
along
with
me
most
of
us
tried
to
fly
but
some
got
crippled
and
nobody
made
a
success
of
it
so
we
concluded
to
walk
for
the
present
till
we
had
had
some
wing
practice
we
begun
to
meet
swarms
of
folks
who
were
coming
back
some
had
harps
and
nothing
else
some
had
and
nothing
else
some
had
nothing
at
all
all
of
them
looked
meek
and
uncomfortable
one
young
fellow
anything
left
but
his
halo
and
he
was
carrying
that
in
his
hand
all
of
a
sudden
he
offered
it
to
me
and
you
hold
it
for
me
a
minute
then
he
disappeared
in
the
crowd
i
went
on
a
woman
asked
me
to
hold
her
palm
branch
and
then
disappeared
a
girl
got
me
to
hold
her
harp
for
her
and
by
george
disappeared
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
i
was
about
loaded
down
to
the
guards
then
comes
a
smiling
old
gentleman
and
asked
me
to
hold
things
i
swabbed
off
the
perspiration
and
says
pretty
have
to
get
you
to
excuse
me
my
friend
no
about
this
time
i
begun
to
run
across
piles
of
those
traps
lying
in
the
road
i
just
quietly
dumped
my
extra
cargo
along
with
them
i
looked
around
and
peters
that
whole
nation
that
was
following
me
were
loaded
down
the
same
as
been
the
return
crowd
had
got
them
to
hold
their
things
a
minute
you
see
they
all
dumped
their
loads
too
and
we
went
on
when
i
found
myself
perched
on
a
cloud
with
a
million
other
people
i
never
felt
so
good
in
my
life
says
i
this
is
according
to
the
promises
been
having
my
doubts
but
now
i
am
in
heaven
sure
i
gave
my
palm
branch
a
wave
or
two
for
luck
and
then
i
tautened
up
my
and
struck
in
well
peters
you
imagine
anything
like
the
row
we
made
it
was
grand
to
listen
to
and
made
a
body
thrill
all
over
but
there
was
considerable
many
tunes
going
on
at
once
and
that
was
a
drawback
to
the
harmony
you
understand
and
then
there
was
a
lot
of
injun
tribes
and
they
kept
up
such
another
that
they
kind
of
took
the
tuck
out
of
the
music
by
and
by
i
quit
performing
and
judged
take
a
rest
there
was
quite
a
nice
mild
old
gentleman
sitting
next
me
and
i
noticed
he
take
a
hand
i
encouraged
him
but
he
said
he
was
naturally
bashful
and
was
afraid
to
try
before
so
many
people
by
and
by
the
old
gentleman
said
he
never
could
seem
to
enjoy
music
somehow
the
fact
was
i
was
beginning
to
feel
the
same
way
but
i
say
anything
him
and
i
had
a
considerable
long
silence
then
but
of
course
it
noticeable
in
that
place
after
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
hours
during
which
i
played
and
sung
a
little
now
and
the
same
tune
because
i
know
any
laid
down
my
harp
and
begun
to
fan
myself
with
my
palm
branch
then
we
both
got
to
sighing
pretty
regular
finally
says
you
know
any
tune
but
the
one
been
pegging
at
all
day
another
blessed
one
says
i
you
reckon
you
could
learn
another
one
says
he
says
i
tried
to
but
i
manage
a
long
time
to
hang
to
the
you
break
my
heart
says
i
getting
enough
after
another
long
silence
says
you
glad
to
be
here
says
i
man
be
frank
with
you
this
just
as
near
my
idea
of
bliss
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
when
i
used
to
go
to
says
he
do
you
say
to
knocking
off
and
calling
it
half
a
day
me
says
i
never
wanted
to
get
off
watch
so
bad
in
my
so
we
started
millions
were
coming
to
the
all
the
time
happy
and
hosannahing
millions
were
leaving
it
all
the
time
looking
mighty
quiet
i
tell
you
we
laid
for
the
and
pretty
soon
got
them
to
hold
all
my
things
a
minute
and
then
i
was
a
free
man
again
and
most
outrageously
happy
just
then
i
ran
across
old
sam
bartlett
who
had
been
dead
a
long
time
and
stopped
to
have
a
talk
with
him
says
tell
this
to
go
on
forever
there
anything
else
for
a
change
says
set
you
right
on
that
point
very
quick
people
take
the
figurative
language
of
the
bible
and
the
allegories
for
literal
and
the
first
thing
they
ask
for
when
they
get
here
is
a
halo
and
a
harp
and
so
on
nothing
harmless
and
reasonable
is
refused
a
body
here
if
he
asks
it
in
the
right
spirit
so
they
are
outfitted
with
these
things
without
a
word
they
go
and
sing
and
play
just
about
one
day
and
the
last
ever
see
them
in
the
choir
they
need
anybody
to
tell
them
that
that
sort
of
thing
make
a
least
not
a
heaven
that
a
sane
man
could
stand
a
week
and
remain
sane
that
is
placed
where
the
noise
disturb
the
old
inhabitants
and
so
there
any
harm
in
letting
everybody
get
up
there
and
cure
himself
as
soon
as
he
comes
you
just
remember
is
as
blissful
and
lovely
as
it
can
be
but
just
the
busiest
place
you
ever
heard
of
there
any
idle
people
here
after
the
first
day
singing
hymns
and
waving
palm
branches
through
all
eternity
is
pretty
when
you
hear
about
it
in
the
pulpit
but
as
poor
a
way
to
put
in
valuable
time
as
a
body
could
contrive
it
would
just
make
a
heaven
of
warbling
ignoramuses
you
see
eternal
rest
sounds
comforting
in
the
pulpit
too
well
you
try
it
once
and
see
how
heavy
time
will
hang
on
your
hands
why
stormfield
a
man
like
you
that
had
been
active
and
stirring
all
his
life
would
go
mad
in
six
months
in
a
heaven
where
he
anything
to
do
heaven
is
the
very
last
place
to
come
to
in
you
be
afraid
to
bet
on
that
says
as
glad
to
hear
it
as
i
thought
be
sorry
glad
i
come
says
you
pretty
physically
tired
says
it
any
name
for
it
so
earned
a
good
sleep
and
get
it
earned
a
good
appetite
and
enjoy
your
dinner
the
same
here
as
it
is
on
got
to
earn
a
thing
square
and
honest
before
you
enjoy
it
you
enjoy
first
and
earn
afterwards
but
this
difference
here
you
can
choose
your
own
occupation
and
all
the
powers
of
heaven
will
be
put
forth
to
help
you
make
a
success
of
it
if
you
do
your
level
best
the
shoemaker
on
earth
that
had
the
soul
of
a
poet
in
him
have
to
make
shoes
all
reasonable
and
right
says
i
of
work
and
the
kind
you
hanker
after
no
more
pain
no
more
hold
on
plenty
of
pain
it
kill
plenty
of
suffering
here
but
it
last
you
see
happiness
a
in
only
a
with
something
that
pleasant
all
it
is
there
a
thing
you
can
mention
that
is
happiness
in
its
own
only
so
by
contrast
with
the
other
thing
and
so
as
soon
as
the
novelty
is
over
and
the
force
of
the
contrast
dulled
it
happiness
any
longer
and
you
have
to
get
something
fresh
well
plenty
of
pain
and
suffering
in
plenty
of
contrasts
and
just
no
end
of
says
i
the
sensiblest
heaven
heard
of
yet
sam
though
about
as
different
from
the
one
i
was
brought
up
on
as
a
live
princess
is
different
from
her
own
wax
along
in
the
first
months
i
knocked
around
about
the
kingdom
making
friends
and
looking
at
the
country
and
finally
settled
down
in
a
pretty
likely
region
to
have
a
rest
before
taking
another
start
i
went
on
making
acquaintances
and
gathering
up
information
i
had
a
good
deal
of
talk
with
an
old
angel
by
the
name
of
sandy
mcwilliams
he
was
from
somewhere
in
new
jersey
i
went
about
with
him
considerable
we
used
to
lay
around
warm
afternoons
in
the
shade
of
a
rock
on
some
that
was
pretty
high
and
out
of
the
marshy
slush
of
his
and
there
we
used
to
talk
about
all
kinds
of
things
and
smoke
pipes
one
day
says
how
old
might
you
be
sandy
judged
so
how
long
you
been
in
heaven
years
come
old
was
you
when
you
come
up
of
mean
it
i
mean
it
if
you
was
then
you
are
naturally
but
i
i
stay
the
same
age
i
was
when
i
says
i
to
think
something
just
here
that
i
want
to
ask
about
down
below
i
always
had
an
idea
that
in
heaven
we
would
all
be
young
and
bright
and
you
can
be
young
if
you
want
to
only
got
to
then
why
you
wish
did
they
all
do
try
it
some
day
like
enough
but
get
tired
of
the
change
pretty
tell
you
now
always
been
a
sailor
did
you
ever
try
some
other
business
i
tried
keeping
grocery
once
up
in
the
mines
but
i
stand
it
it
was
too
stir
no
storm
no
life
about
it
it
was
like
being
part
dead
and
part
alive
both
at
the
same
time
i
wanted
to
be
one
thing
or
i
shut
up
shop
pretty
quick
and
went
to
it
grocery
people
like
it
but
you
you
see
you
used
to
it
well
i
used
to
being
young
and
i
seem
to
take
any
interest
in
it
i
was
strong
and
handsome
and
had
curly
hair
and
wings
too
wings
like
a
butterfly
i
went
to
picnics
and
dances
and
parties
with
the
fellows
and
tried
to
carry
on
and
talk
nonsense
with
the
girls
but
it
any
use
i
take
to
is
it
was
an
awful
bore
what
i
wanted
was
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
and
something
to
and
when
my
work
was
done
i
wanted
to
sit
quiet
and
smoke
and
tear
around
with
a
parcel
of
giddy
young
kids
you
think
what
i
suffered
whilst
i
was
long
was
you
young
two
weeks
that
was
plenty
for
me
laws
i
was
so
lonesome
you
see
i
was
full
of
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
years
the
deepest
subject
those
young
folks
could
strike
was
only
to
me
and
to
hear
them
my
it
would
have
been
funny
if
it
been
so
pitiful
well
i
was
so
hungry
for
the
ways
and
the
sober
talk
i
was
used
to
that
i
tried
to
ring
in
with
the
old
people
but
they
have
it
they
considered
me
a
conceited
young
upstart
and
gave
me
the
cold
shoulder
two
weeks
was
for
me
i
was
glad
to
get
back
my
bald
head
again
and
my
pipe
and
my
old
drowsy
reflections
in
the
shade
of
a

and
i
particular
but
i
going
to
drop
back
to
any
know
that
mighty
well
i
know
a
sight
more
than
i
did
years
ago
and
i
enjoy
learning
all
the
time
but
i
seem
to
get
any
older
that
is
mind
gets
older
and
stronger
and
better
seasoned
and
more
says
i
a
man
comes
here
at
ninety
he
ever
set
himself
back
course
he
does
he
sets
himself
back
to
fourteen
tries
it
a
couple
of
hours
and
feels
like
a
fool
sets
himself
forward
to
twenty
it
much
improvement
tries
thirty
fifty
eighty
and
finally
he
is
more
at
home
and
comfortable
at
the
same
old
figure
he
is
used
to
than
any
other
way
or
if
his
mind
begun
to
fail
him
on
earth
at
eighty
where
he
finally
sticks
up
here
he
sticks
at
the
place
where
his
mind
was
last
at
its
best
for
where
his
enjoyment
is
best
and
his
ways
most
set
and
a
chap
of
stay
always
and
look
it
he
is
a
fool
yes
but
if
he
is
bright
and
ambitious
and
industrious
the
knowledge
he
gains
and
the
experiences
he
has
change
his
ways
and
thoughts
and
likings
and
make
him
find
his
best
pleasure
in
the
company
of
people
above
that
age
so
he
allows
his
body
to
take
on
that
look
of
as
many
added
years
as
he
needs
to
make
him
comfortable
and
proper
in
that
sort
of
society
he
lets
his
body
go
on
taking
the
look
of
age
according
as
he
progresses
and
by
and
by
he
will
be
bald
and
wrinkled
outside
and
wise
and
deep
the
same
the
same
laws
what
asses
we
used
to
be
on
earth
about
these
things
we
said
be
always
young
in
heaven
we
say
think
of
that
is
we
all
think
alike
anyway
when
i
was
a
boy
of
seven
i
suppose
i
thought
all
be
twelve
in
heaven
when
i
was
twelve
i
suppose
i
thought
all
be
eighteen
or
twenty
in
heaven
when
i
was
forty
i
begun
to
go
back
i
remember
i
hoped
all
be
about
years
old
in
heaven
neither
a
man
nor
a
boy
ever
thinks
the
age
he
is
exactly
the
best
puts
the
right
age
a
few
years
older
or
a
few
years
younger
than
he
is
then
he
makes
that
ideal
age
the
general
age
of
the
heavenly
people
and
he
expects
everybody
at
that
expects
them
to
enjoy
it
just
think
of
the
idea
of
standing
still
in
heaven
think
of
a
heaven
made
up
entirely
of
cubs
of
seven
years
of
awkward
diffident
sentimental
immaturities
of
nineteen
of
vigorous
people
of
thirty
brimming
with
ambition
but
chained
hand
and
foot
to
that
one
age
and
its
limitations
like
so
many
helpless
think
of
the
dull
sameness
of
a
society
made
up
of
people
all
of
one
age
and
one
set
of
looks
habits
tastes
and
feelings
think
how
superior
to
it
earth
would
be
with
its
variety
of
types
and
faces
and
ages
and
the
enlivening
attrition
of
the
myriad
interests
that
come
into
pleasant
collision
in
such
a
variegated
here
says
i
you
know
what
doing
what
am
i
doing
are
making
heaven
pretty
comfortable
in
one
way
but
you
are
playing
the
mischief
with
it
in
mean
i
says
a
young
mother
lost
her
child
he
says
it
was
a
woman
and
had
grizzled
hair
she
was
walking
slow
and
her
head
was
bent
down
and
her
wings
hanging
limp
and
droopy
and
she
looked
ever
so
tired
and
was
crying
poor
thing
she
passed
along
by
with
her
head
down
that
way
and
the
tears
running
down
her
face
and
see
us
then
sandy
said
low
and
gentle
and
full
of
pity
hunting
for
her
child
no
it
i
reckon
lord
how
changed
but
i
recognized
her
in
a
minute
though
years
since
i
saw
her
a
young
mother
she
was
about
twenty
two
or
four
or
along
there
and
blooming
and
lovely
and
sweet
oh
just
a
flower
and
all
her
heart
and
all
her
soul
was
wrapped
up
in
her
child
her
little
girl
two
years
old
and
it
died
and
she
went
wild
with
grief
just
wild
well
the
only
comfort
she
had
was
that
see
her
child
again
in
more
to
part
she
said
and
kept
on
saying
it
over
and
over
more
to
and
the
words
made
her
happy
yes
they
did
they
made
her
joyful
and
when
i
was
dying
years
ago
she
told
me
to
find
her
child
the
first
thing
and
say
she
was
soon
soon
she
hoped
and
believed
pitiful
he
say
anything
for
a
while
but
sat
looking
at
the
ground
thinking
then
he
says
kind
of
mournful
now
come
go
maybe
she
found
the
child
but
think
she
has
looks
so
to
me
seen
cases
before
you
see
kept
that
child
in
her
head
just
the
same
as
it
was
when
she
jounced
it
in
her
arms
a
little
chubby
thing
but
here
it
elect
to
a
child
no
it
elected
to
grow
up
which
it
did
and
in
these
years
it
has
learned
all
the
deep
scientific
learning
there
is
to
learn
and
is
studying
and
studying
and
learning
and
learning
more
and
more
all
the
time
and
give
a
damn
for
anything
learning
just
learning
and
discussing
gigantic
problems
with
people
like
you
see
her
mother
knows
and
how
to
tend
them
and
pick
them
and
put
them
up
and
market
them
and
not
another
blamed
thing
her
and
her
daughter
be
any
more
company
for
each
other
than
mud
turtle
and
bird
paradise
poor
thing
she
was
looking
for
a
baby
to
jounce
think
struck
a
what
will
they
unhappy
forever
in
heaven
come
together
and
get
adjusted
by
and
by
but
not
this
year
and
not
next
by
and
chapter
ii
i
had
been
having
considerable
trouble
with
my
wings
the
day
after
i
helped
the
choir
i
made
a
dash
or
two
with
them
but
was
not
lucky
first
off
i
flew
thirty
yards
and
then
fouled
an
irishman
and
brought
him
us
both
down
in
fact
next
i
had
a
collision
with
a
bowled
him
down
of
course
we
had
some
sharp
words
and
i
felt
pretty
cheap
to
come
banging
into
a
grave
old
person
like
that
with
a
million
strangers
looking
on
and
smiling
to
themselves
i
saw
i
got
the
hang
of
the
steering
and
so
rightly
tell
where
i
was
going
to
bring
up
when
i
started
i
went
afoot
the
rest
of
the
day
and
let
my
wings
hang
early
next
morning
i
went
to
a
private
place
to
have
some
practice
i
got
up
on
a
pretty
high
rock
and
got
a
good
start
and
went
swooping
down
aiming
for
a
bush
a
little
over
three
hundred
yards
off
but
i
seem
to
calculate
for
the
wind
which
was
about
two
points
abaft
my
beam
i
could
see
i
was
going
considerable
to
looard
of
the
bush
so
i
worked
my
starboard
wing
slow
and
went
ahead
strong
on
the
port
one
but
it
answer
i
could
see
i
was
going
to
broach
to
so
i
slowed
down
on
both
and
lit
i
went
back
to
the
rock
and
took
another
chance
at
it
i
aimed
two
or
three
points
to
starboard
of
the
more
than
so
as
to
make
it
nearly
a
i
done
well
enough
but
made
pretty
poor
time
i
could
see
plain
enough
that
on
a
wings
was
a
mistake
i
could
see
that
a
body
could
sail
pretty
close
to
the
wind
but
he
go
in
the
eye
i
could
see
that
if
i
wanted
to
go
any
distance
from
home
and
the
wind
was
ahead
i
might
have
to
wait
days
maybe
for
a
change
and
i
could
see
too
that
these
things
could
not
be
any
use
at
all
in
a
gale
if
you
tried
to
run
before
the
wind
you
would
make
a
mess
of
it
for
there
anyway
to
shorten
reefing
you
have
to
take
it
your
feathers
down
flat
to
your
sides
that
would
you
of
course
you
could
lay
to
with
your
head
to
the
is
the
best
you
could
do
and
right
hard
work
find
it
too
if
you
tried
any
other
game
you
would
founder
sure
i
judge
it
was
about
a
couple
of
weeks
or
so
after
this
that
i
dropped
old
sandy
mcwilliams
a
note
one
was
a
asked
him
to
come
over
and
take
his
manna
and
quails
with
me
next
day
and
the
first
thing
he
did
when
he
stepped
in
was
to
twinkle
his
eye
in
a
sly
way
and
say
cap
what
you
done
with
your
wings
i
saw
in
a
minute
that
there
was
some
sarcasm
done
up
in
that
rag
somewheres
but
i
never
let
on
i
only
says
to
the
he
says
in
a
dry
sort
of
way
mostly
go
to
the
this
often
noticed
it
fresh
angels
are
powerful
neat
when
do
you
look
for
back
after
says
i
he
winked
at
me
and
smiled
says
i
out
with
it
secrets
among
friends
i
notice
you
ever
wear
plenty
others
been
making
an
ass
of
that
it
is
about
the
size
of
it
but
it
is
no
harm
we
all
do
it
at
first
perfectly
natural
you
see
on
earth
we
jump
to
such
foolish
conclusions
as
to
things
up
here
in
the
pictures
we
always
saw
the
angels
with
wings
that
was
all
right
but
we
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
that
was
their
way
of
getting
that
was
all
wrong
the
wings
anything
but
a
uniform
all
when
they
are
in
the
to
speak
always
wear
them
you
never
see
an
angel
going
with
a
message
anywhere
without
his
wings
any
more
than
you
would
see
a
military
officer
presiding
at
a
without
his
uniform
or
a
postman
delivering
letters
or
a
policeman
walking
his
beat
in
plain
clothes
but
they
to
with
the
wings
are
for
show
not
for
use
old
experienced
angels
are
like
officers
of
the
regular
dress
plain
when
they
are
off
duty
new
angels
are
like
the
shed
the
fluttering
and
floundering
around
in
their
wings
butting
people
down
flapping
here
and
there
and
everywhere
always
imagining
they
are
attracting
the
admiring
they
just
think
they
are
the
very
most
important
people
in
heaven
and
when
you
see
one
of
them
come
sailing
around
with
one
wing
tipped
up
and
down
you
make
up
your
mind
he
is
saying
to
himself
wish
mary
ann
in
arkansaw
could
see
me
now
i
reckon
wish
she
shook
no
just
for
show
just
for
judge
got
it
about
right
sandy
says
i
look
at
it
yourself
says
he
built
for
man
is
you
know
what
a
grist
of
years
it
took
you
to
come
here
from
the
yet
you
were
booming
along
faster
than
any
could
go
suppose
you
had
to
fly
that
distance
with
your
eternity
have
been
over
before
you
got
here
certainly
well
angels
have
to
go
to
the
earth
every
of
appear
in
visions
to
dying
children
and
good
people
you
the
heft
of
their
business
they
appear
with
their
wings
of
course
because
they
are
on
official
service
and
because
the
dying
persons
know
they
were
angels
if
they
do
you
reckon
they
fly
with
them
it
stands
to
reason
they
the
wings
would
wear
out
before
they
got
even
the
would
be
gone
the
wing
frames
would
be
as
bare
as
kite
sticks
before
the
paper
is
pasted
on
the
distances
in
heaven
are
billions
of
times
greater
angels
have
to
go
all
over
heaven
every
day
could
they
do
it
with
their
wings
alone
no
indeed
they
wear
the
wings
for
style
but
they
travel
any
distance
in
an
instant
by
the
of
the
arabian
nights
was
a
sensible
our
earthly
idea
of
angels
flying
these
awful
distances
with
their
clumsy
wings
was
foolish
young
saints
of
both
sexes
wear
wings
all
the
red
ones
and
blue
and
green
and
gold
and
variegated
and
rainbowed
and
nobody
finds
fault
it
is
suitable
to
their
time
of
life
the
things
are
beautiful
and
they
set
the
young
people
off
they
are
the
most
striking
and
lovely
part
of
their
halo
says
i
tucked
mine
away
in
the
cupboard
and
i
allow
to
let
them
lay
there
till
a
that
you
can
see
one
if
you
want
to
a
barkeeper
from
jersey
city
going
to
be
me
about
barkeeper
got
converted
at
a
moody
and
sankey
meeting
in
new
york
and
started
home
on
the
and
there
was
a
collision
and
he
got
drowned
he
is
of
a
class
that
think
all
heaven
goes
wild
with
joy
when
a
particularly
hard
lot
like
him
is
saved
they
think
all
heaven
turns
out
hosannahing
to
welcome
them
they
think
there
anything
talked
about
in
the
realms
of
the
blest
but
their
case
for
that
day
this
barkeeper
thinks
there
been
such
another
stir
here
in
years
as
his
coming
is
going
to
always
noticed
this
peculiarity
about
a
dead
not
only
expects
all
hands
to
turn
out
when
he
arrives
but
he
expects
to
be
received
with
a
torchlight
reckon
he
is
disappointed
he
no
man
is
allowed
to
be
disappointed
here
whatever
he
wants
when
he
is
any
reasonable
and
unsacrilegious
can
have
always
a
few
millions
or
billions
of
young
folks
around
who
want
any
better
entertainment
than
to
fill
up
their
lungs
and
swarm
out
with
their
torches
and
have
a
high
time
over
a
barkeeper
it
tickles
the
barkeeper
till
he
rest
it
makes
a
charming
lark
for
the
young
folks
it
do
anybody
any
harm
it
cost
a
rap
and
it
keeps
up
the
reputation
for
making
all
comers
happy
and
good
be
on
hand
and
see
them
land
the
is
manners
to
go
in
full
dress
you
want
to
wear
your
wings
you
know
and
your
other
ones
and
harp
and
palm
branch
and
all
says
i
reckon
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
but
the
fact
is
i
left
them
laying
around
that
day
i
resigned
from
the
choir
i
got
a
rag
to
wear
but
this
robe
and
the
all
right
find
been
raked
up
and
saved
for
you
send
for
do
it
sandy
but
what
was
it
you
was
saying
about
unsacrilegious
things
which
people
expect
to
get
and
will
be
disappointed
about
there
are
a
lot
of
such
things
that
people
expect
and
get
for
instance
a
brooklyn
preacher
by
the
name
of
talmage
who
is
laying
up
a
considerable
disappointment
for
himself
he
says
every
now
and
then
in
his
sermons
that
the
first
thing
he
does
when
he
gets
to
heaven
will
be
to
fling
his
arms
around
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
and
kiss
them
and
weep
on
them
millions
of
people
down
there
on
earth
that
are
promising
themselves
the
same
thing
as
many
as
sixty
thousand
people
arrive
here
every
single
day
that
want
to
run
straight
to
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
and
hug
them
and
weep
on
them
now
mind
you
sixty
thousand
a
day
is
a
pretty
heavy
contract
for
those
old
people
if
they
were
a
mind
to
allow
it
they
ever
have
anything
to
do
year
in
and
year
out
but
stand
up
and
be
hugged
and
wept
on
hours
in
the
they
would
be
tired
out
and
as
wet
as
muskrats
all
the
time
what
would
heaven
be
to
it
would
be
a
mighty
good
place
to
get
out
know
that
yourself
those
are
kind
and
gentle
old
jews
but
they
any
fonder
of
kissing
the
emotional
highlights
of
brooklyn
than
you
be
you
mark
my
words
endearments
are
going
to
be
declined
with
thanks
there
are
limits
to
the
privileges
of
the
elect
even
in
heaven
why
if
adam
was
to
show
himself
to
every
new
comer
that
wants
to
call
and
gaze
at
him
and
strike
him
for
his
autograph
he
would
never
have
time
to
do
anything
else
but
just
that
talmage
has
said
he
is
going
to
give
adam
some
of
his
attentions
as
well
as
and
j
but
he
will
have
to
change
his
mind
about
you
think
talmage
will
really
come
here
certainly
he
will
but
you
be
alarmed
he
will
run
with
his
own
kind
and
plenty
of
them
that
is
the
main
charm
of
all
kinds
be
the
case
if
you
let
the
preachers
tell
it
anybody
can
find
the
sort
he
prefers
here
and
he
just
lets
the
others
alone
and
they
let
him
alone
when
the
deity
builds
a
heaven
it
is
built
right
and
on
a
liberal
sandy
sent
home
for
his
things
and
i
sent
for
mine
and
about
nine
in
the
evening
we
begun
to
dress
sandy
says
is
going
to
be
a
grand
time
for
you
stormy
like
as
not
some
of
the
patriarchs
will
turn
but
will
they
as
not
of
course
they
are
pretty
exclusive
they
hardly
ever
show
themselves
to
the
common
public
i
believe
they
never
turn
out
except
for
an
convert
they
do
it
then
only
earthly
tradition
makes
a
grand
show
pretty
necessary
on
that
kind
of
an
they
an
turn
out
sandy
the
patriarchs
oh
ever
more
than
a
couple
you
will
be
here
fifty
thousand
you
get
a
glimpse
of
all
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
since
i
have
been
here
job
has
been
to
the
front
once
and
once
ham
and
jeremiah
both
at
the
same
time
but
the
finest
thing
that
has
happened
in
my
day
was
a
year
or
so
ago
that
was
charles
they
called
bannercross
englishman
there
were
four
patriarchs
and
two
prophets
on
the
grand
stand
that
been
anything
like
it
since
captain
kidd
came
abel
was
first
time
in
twelve
hundred
years
a
report
got
around
that
adam
was
coming
well
of
course
abel
was
enough
to
bring
a
crowd
all
by
himself
but
there
is
nobody
that
can
draw
like
adam
it
was
a
false
report
but
it
got
around
anyway
as
i
say
and
it
will
be
a
long
day
before
i
see
the
like
of
it
again
the
reception
was
in
the
english
department
of
course
which
is
eight
hundred
and
eleven
million
miles
from
the
new
jersey
line
i
went
along
with
a
good
many
of
my
neighbors
and
it
was
a
sight
to
see
i
can
tell
you
flocks
came
from
all
the
departments
i
saw
esquimaux
there
and
tartars
negroes
from
everywhere
you
see
a
mixture
like
that
in
the
grand
choir
the
first
day
you
land
here
but
you
hardly
ever
see
it
again
there
were
billions
of
people
when
they
were
singing
or
hosannahing
the
noise
was
wonderful
and
even
when
their
tongues
were
still
the
drumming
of
the
wings
was
nearly
enough
to
burst
your
head
for
all
the
sky
was
as
thick
as
if
it
was
snowing
angels
although
adam
was
not
there
it
was
a
great
time
anyway
because
we
had
three
archangels
on
the
grand
is
a
seldom
thing
that
even
one
comes
did
they
look
like
sandy
they
had
shining
faces
and
shining
robes
and
wonderful
rainbow
wings
and
they
stood
eighteen
feet
high
and
wore
swords
and
held
their
heads
up
in
a
noble
way
and
looked
like
they
have
halos
not
the
hoop
kind
the
archangels
and
the
patriarchs
wear
a
finer
thing
than
that
it
is
a
round
solid
splendid
glory
of
gold
that
is
blinding
to
look
at
you
have
often
seen
a
patriarch
in
a
picture
on
earth
with
that
thing
remember
it
looks
as
if
he
had
his
head
in
a
brass
platter
that
give
you
the
right
idea
of
it
at
is
much
more
shining
and
you
talk
with
those
archangels
and
patriarchs
sandy
why
what
can
you
be
thinking
about
stormy
i
worthy
to
speak
to
such
as
talmage
course
not
you
have
got
the
same
idea
about
these
things
that
everybody
has
down
there
i
had
it
once
but
i
got
over
it
down
there
they
talk
of
the
heavenly
that
is
then
they
go
right
on
speaking
as
if
this
was
a
republic
and
everybody
was
on
a
dead
level
with
everybody
else
and
privileged
to
fling
his
arms
around
anybody
he
comes
across
and
be
with
all
the
elect
from
the
highest
down
how
tangled
up
and
absurd
that
is
how
are
you
going
to
have
a
republic
under
a
king
how
are
you
going
to
have
a
republic
at
all
where
the
head
of
the
government
is
absolute
holds
his
place
forever
and
has
no
parliament
no
council
to
meddle
or
make
in
his
affairs
nobody
voted
for
nobody
elected
nobody
in
the
whole
universe
with
a
voice
in
the
government
nobody
asked
to
take
a
hand
in
its
matters
and
nobody
to
do
it
fine
republic
it
a
little
different
from
the
idea
i
i
thought
i
might
go
around
and
get
acquainted
with
the
grandees
exactly
splice
the
with
them
you
know
but
shake
hands
and
pass
the
time
of
tom
dick
and
harry
call
on
the
cabinet
of
russia
and
do
that
prince
gortschakoff
for
instance
reckon
not
this
is
more
so
not
the
shadow
of
a
republic
about
it
anywhere
there
are
ranks
here
there
are
viceroys
princes
governors
and
a
hundred
orders
of
nobility
grading
along
down
from
archangels
stage
by
stage
till
the
general
level
is
struck
where
there
any
titles
do
you
know
what
a
prince
of
the
blood
is
on
earth
a
prince
of
the
blood
belong
to
the
royal
family
exactly
and
he
belong
to
the
mere
nobility
of
the
kingdom
he
is
lower
than
the
one
and
higher
than
about
the
position
of
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
here
some
mighty
high
nobility
that
you
and
i
worthy
to
polish
sandals
worthy
to
polish
sandals
for
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
that
gives
you
a
kind
of
an
idea
of
their
rank
it
you
begin
to
see
how
high
up
they
are
you
just
to
get
a
glimpse
of
one
of
them
is
a
thing
for
a
body
to
remember
and
tell
about
for
a
thousand
years
why
captain
just
think
of
this
if
abraham
was
to
set
his
foot
down
here
by
this
door
there
would
be
a
railing
set
up
around
that
right
away
and
a
shelter
put
over
it
and
people
would
flock
here
from
all
over
heaven
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
to
look
at
it
abraham
is
one
of
the
parties
that
talmage
of
brooklyn
is
going
to
embrace
and
kiss
and
weep
on
when
he
comes
he
wants
to
lay
in
a
good
stock
of
tears
you
know
or
five
to
one
he
will
go
dry
before
he
gets
a
chance
to
do
says
i
had
an
idea
that
was
going
to
be
equals
with
everybody
here
too
but
i
will
let
that
drop
it
matter
and
i
am
plenty
happy
enough
you
are
happier
than
you
would
be
the
other
way
these
old
patriarchs
and
prophets
have
got
ages
the
start
of
you
they
know
more
in
two
minutes
than
you
know
in
a
year
did
you
ever
try
to
have
a
sociable
discussing
winds
and
currents
and
variations
of
compass
with
an
undertaker
get
your
idea
sandy
he
interest
me
he
would
be
an
ignoramus
in
such
would
bore
me
and
i
would
bore
have
got
it
you
would
bore
the
patriarchs
when
you
talked
and
when
they
talked
they
would
shoot
over
your
head
by
and
by
you
would
say
morning
your
eminence
i
will
call
you
did
you
ever
ask
the
to
come
up
in
the
cabin
and
take
dinner
with
you
get
your
drift
again
sandy
i
be
used
to
such
grand
people
as
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
and
i
would
be
sheepish
and
in
their
company
and
mighty
glad
to
get
out
of
it
sandy
which
is
the
highest
rank
patriarch
or
prophet
the
prophets
hold
over
the
patriarchs
the
newest
prophet
even
is
of
a
sight
more
consequence
than
the
oldest
patriarch
yes
sir
adam
himself
has
to
walk
behind
shakespeare
a
prophet
course
he
was
and
so
was
homer
and
heaps
more
but
shakespeare
and
the
rest
have
to
walk
behind
a
common
tailor
from
tennessee
by
the
name
of
billings
and
behind
a
named
sakka
from
afghanistan
jeremiah
and
billings
and
buddha
walk
together
side
by
side
right
behind
a
crowd
from
planets
not
in
our
astronomy
next
come
a
dozen
or
two
from
jupiter
and
other
worlds
next
come
daniel
and
sakka
and
confucius
next
a
lot
from
systems
outside
of
ours
next
come
ezekiel
and
mahomet
zoroaster
and
a
from
ancient
egypt
then
there
is
a
long
string
and
after
them
away
down
toward
the
bottom
come
shakespeare
and
homer
and
a
shoemaker
named
marais
from
the
back
settlements
of
they
really
rung
in
mahomet
and
all
those
other
heathens
all
had
their
message
and
they
all
get
their
reward
the
man
who
get
his
reward
on
earth
will
get
it
here
why
did
they
throw
off
on
shakespeare
that
way
and
put
him
away
down
there
below
those
and
and
lot
of
people
nobody
ever
heard
of
is
the
heavenly
justice
of
rewarded
according
to
their
deserts
on
earth
but
here
they
get
their
rightful
rank
that
tailor
billings
from
tennessee
wrote
poetry
that
homer
and
shakespeare
begin
to
come
up
to
but
nobody
would
print
it
nobody
read
it
but
his
neighbors
an
ignorant
lot
and
they
laughed
at
it
whenever
the
village
had
a
drunken
frolic
and
a
dance
they
would
drag
him
in
and
crown
him
with
cabbage
leaves
and
pretend
to
bow
down
to
him
and
one
night
when
he
was
sick
and
nearly
starved
to
death
they
had
him
out
and
crowned
him
and
then
they
rode
him
on
a
rail
about
the
village
and
everybody
followed
along
beating
tin
pans
and
yelling
well
he
died
before
morning
he
ever
expecting
to
go
to
heaven
much
less
that
there
was
going
to
be
any
fuss
made
over
him
so
i
reckon
he
was
a
good
deal
surprised
when
the
reception
broke
on
you
there
sandy
you
no
you
know
it
was
going
to
come
off
i
judge
i
did
it
was
the
talk
of
these
for
a
day
like
this
barkeeper
business
but
for
twenty
years
before
the
man
the
mischief
you
go
then
how
you
talk
the
like
of
me
go
meddling
around
at
the
reception
of
a
prophet
a
mudsill
like
me
trying
to
push
in
and
help
receive
an
awful
grandee
like
edward
billings
why
i
should
have
been
laughed
at
for
a
billion
miles
around
i
ever
heard
the
last
of
who
did
go
then
few
people
that
you
and
i
will
ever
get
a
chance
to
see
captain
not
a
solitary
commoner
ever
has
the
luck
to
see
a
reception
of
a
prophet
i
can
tell
you
all
the
nobility
and
all
the
patriarchs
and
last
one
of
all
the
archangels
and
all
the
princes
and
governors
and
viceroys
were
there
small
a
single
one
and
mind
you
not
talking
about
only
the
grandees
from
world
but
the
princes
and
patriarchs
and
so
on
from
the
worlds
that
shine
in
our
sky
and
from
billions
more
that
belong
in
systems
upon
systems
away
outside
of
the
one
our
sun
is
in
there
were
some
prophets
and
patriarchs
there
that
ours
a
circumstance
to
for
rank
and
illustriousness
and
all
that
some
were
from
jupiter
and
other
worlds
in
our
own
system
but
the
most
celebrated
were
three
poets
saa
bo
and
soof
from
great
planets
in
three
different
and
very
remote
systems
these
three
names
are
common
and
familiar
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
heaven
clear
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
as
well
known
as
the
eighty
supreme
archangels
in
as
our
moses
and
adam
and
the
rest
have
not
been
heard
of
outside
of
our
little
corner
of
heaven
except
by
a
few
very
learned
men
scattered
here
and
they
always
spell
their
names
wrong
and
get
the
performances
of
one
mixed
up
with
the
doings
of
another
and
they
almost
always
locate
them
simply
our
solar
and
think
that
is
enough
without
going
into
little
details
such
as
naming
the
particular
world
they
are
from
it
is
like
a
learned
hindoo
showing
off
how
much
he
knows
by
saying
longfellow
lives
in
the
united
if
he
lived
all
over
the
united
states
and
as
if
the
country
was
so
small
you
throw
a
brick
there
without
hitting
him
between
you
and
me
it
does
gravel
me
the
cool
way
people
from
those
monster
worlds
outside
our
system
snub
our
little
world
and
even
our
system
of
course
we
think
a
good
deal
of
jupiter
because
our
world
is
only
a
potato
to
it
for
size
but
then
there
are
worlds
in
other
systems
that
jupiter
even
a
the
planet
goobra
for
instance
which
you
squeeze
inside
the
orbit
of
comet
without
straining
the
rivets
tourists
from
goobra
i
mean
parties
that
lived
and
died
come
here
now
and
then
and
inquire
about
our
world
and
when
they
find
out
it
is
so
little
that
a
streak
of
lightning
can
flash
clear
around
it
in
the
eighth
of
a
second
they
have
to
lean
up
against
something
to
laugh
then
they
screw
a
glass
into
their
eye
and
go
to
examining
us
as
if
we
were
a
curious
kind
of
foreign
bug
or
something
of
that
sort
one
of
them
asked
me
how
long
our
day
was
and
when
i
told
him
it
was
twelve
hours
long
as
a
general
thing
he
asked
me
if
people
where
i
was
from
considered
it
worth
while
to
get
up
and
wash
for
such
a
day
as
that
that
is
the
way
with
those
goobra
seem
to
let
a
chance
go
by
to
throw
it
in
your
face
that
their
day
is
three
hundred
and
of
our
years
long
this
young
snob
was
just
of
was
six
or
seven
thousand
of
his
days
two
million
of
our
he
had
all
the
puppy
airs
that
belong
to
that
time
of
when
a
person
has
got
over
being
a
boy
and
yet
quite
a
man
exactly
if
it
had
been
anywhere
else
but
in
heaven
i
would
have
given
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
well
anyway
billings
had
the
grandest
reception
that
has
been
seen
in
thousands
of
centuries
and
i
think
it
will
have
a
good
effect
his
name
will
be
carried
pretty
far
and
it
will
make
our
system
talked
about
and
maybe
our
world
too
and
raise
us
in
the
respect
of
the
general
public
of
heaven
why
look
walked
backwards
before
that
tailor
from
tennessee
and
scattered
flowers
for
him
to
walk
on
and
homer
stood
behind
his
chair
and
waited
on
him
at
the
banquet
of
course
that
go
for
much
amongst
all
those
big
foreigners
from
other
systems
as
they
heard
of
shakespeare
or
homer
either
but
it
would
amount
to
considerable
down
there
on
our
little
earth
if
they
could
know
about
it
i
wish
there
was
something
in
that
miserable
spiritualism
so
we
could
send
them
word
that
tennessee
village
would
set
up
a
monument
to
billings
then
and
his
autograph
would
outsell
well
they
had
grand
times
at
that
noble
from
hoboken
told
me
all
about
richard
duffer
sandy
a
nobleman
from
hoboken
how
is
that
enough
duffer
kept
a
and
never
saved
a
cent
in
his
life
because
he
used
to
give
all
his
spare
meat
to
the
poor
in
a
quiet
way
not
tramps
the
other
sort
that
will
starve
before
they
will
square
people
out
of
work
dick
used
to
watch
men
and
women
and
children
and
track
them
home
and
find
out
all
about
them
from
the
neighbors
and
then
feed
them
and
find
them
work
as
nobody
ever
saw
him
give
anything
to
anybody
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
mean
he
died
with
it
too
and
everybody
said
it
was
a
good
riddance
but
the
minute
he
landed
here
they
made
him
a
baronet
and
the
very
first
words
dick
the
of
hoboken
heard
when
he
stepped
upon
the
heavenly
shore
were
sir
richard
duffer
it
surprised
him
some
because
he
thought
he
had
reasons
to
believe
he
was
pointed
for
a
warmer
climate
than
this
all
of
a
sudden
the
whole
region
fairly
rocked
under
the
crash
of
eleven
hundred
and
one
thunder
blasts
all
let
off
at
once
and
sandy
says
for
the
i
jumped
up
and
says
be
moving
along
sandy
we
want
to
miss
any
of
this
thing
you
your
seat
he
says
is
only
just
telegraphed
that
is
blast
only
means
that
he
has
been
sighted
from
the
he
is
off
sandy
hook
the
committees
will
go
down
to
meet
him
now
and
escort
him
in
there
will
be
ceremonies
and
delays
they
he
coming
up
the
bay
for
a
considerable
time
yet
it
is
several
billion
miles
away
could
have
been
a
barkeeper
and
a
hard
lot
just
as
well
as
not
says
i
remembering
the
lonesome
way
i
arrived
and
how
there
any
committee
nor
anything
notice
some
regret
in
your
voice
says
sandy
it
is
natural
enough
but
let
bygones
be
bygones
you
went
according
to
your
lights
and
it
is
too
late
now
to
mend
the
let
it
slide
sandy
i
mind
but
got
a
sandy
hook
too
have
you
got
everything
here
just
as
it
is
below
all
the
states
and
territories
of
the
union
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
are
laid
out
here
just
as
they
are
on
the
the
same
shape
they
are
down
there
and
all
graded
to
the
relative
size
only
each
state
and
realm
and
island
is
a
good
many
billion
times
bigger
here
than
it
is
below
there
goes
another
is
that
one
for
is
only
another
fort
answering
the
first
one
they
each
fire
eleven
hundred
and
one
thunder
blasts
at
a
single
is
the
usual
salute
for
an
guest
a
hundred
for
each
hour
and
an
extra
one
for
the
sex
if
it
was
a
woman
we
would
know
it
by
their
leaving
off
the
extra
do
we
know
eleven
hundred
and
one
sandy
when
they
all
go
off
at
once
yet
we
certainly
do
intellects
are
a
good
deal
sharpened
up
here
in
some
ways
and
that
is
one
of
them
numbers
and
sizes
and
distances
are
so
great
here
that
we
have
to
be
made
so
we
can
old
ways
of
counting
and
measuring
and
ciphering
ever
give
us
an
idea
of
them
but
would
only
confuse
us
and
oppress
us
and
make
our
heads
after
some
more
talk
about
this
i
says
i
notice
that
i
hardly
ever
see
a
white
angel
where
i
run
across
one
white
angel
i
strike
as
many
as
a
hundred
million
that
speak
english
how
is
that
you
will
find
it
the
same
in
any
state
or
territory
of
the
american
corner
of
heaven
you
choose
to
go
to
i
have
shot
along
a
whole
week
on
a
stretch
and
gone
millions
and
millions
of
miles
through
perfect
swarms
of
angels
without
ever
seeing
a
single
white
one
or
hearing
a
word
i
could
understand
you
see
america
was
occupied
a
billion
years
and
more
by
injuns
and
aztecs
and
that
sort
of
folks
before
a
white
man
ever
set
his
foot
in
it
during
the
first
three
hundred
years
after
discovery
there
ever
more
than
one
good
lecture
audience
of
white
people
all
put
together
in
mean
the
whole
thing
british
possessions
and
all
in
the
beginning
of
our
century
there
were
only
or
seven
or
in
say
in
in
our
has
always
been
in
per
annum
well
died
the
first
year
of
the
century
the
year
the
fiftieth
year
about
a
million
the
year
now
i
am
going
to
be
liberal
about
this
thing
and
consider
that
fifty
million
whites
have
died
in
america
from
the
beginning
up
to
it
sixty
if
you
want
to
make
it
a
hundred
no
difference
about
a
few
millions
one
way
or
well
now
you
can
see
yourself
that
when
you
come
to
spread
a
little
dab
of
people
like
that
over
these
hundreds
of
billions
of
miles
of
american
territory
here
in
heaven
it
is
like
scattering
a
box
of
homoeopathic
pills
over
the
great
sahara
and
expecting
to
find
them
again
you
expect
us
to
amount
to
anything
in
heaven
and
we
that
is
the
simple
fact
and
we
have
got
to
do
the
best
we
can
with
it
the
learned
men
from
other
planets
and
other
systems
come
here
and
hang
around
a
while
when
they
are
touring
around
the
kingdom
and
then
go
back
to
their
own
section
of
heaven
and
write
a
book
of
travels
and
they
give
america
about
five
lines
in
it
and
what
do
they
say
about
us
they
say
this
wilderness
is
populated
with
a
scattering
few
hundred
thousand
billions
of
red
angels
with
now
and
then
a
curiously
complected
one
you
see
they
think
we
whites
and
the
occasional
nigger
are
injuns
that
have
been
bleached
out
or
blackened
by
some
leprous
disease
or
some
peculiarly
rascally
mind
you
it
is
a
mighty
sour
pill
for
us
all
my
the
modestest
of
us
let
alone
the
other
kind
that
think
they
are
going
to
be
received
like
a
government
bond
and
hug
abraham
into
the
bargain
i
asked
you
any
of
the
particulars
captain
but
i
judge
it
goes
without
my
experience
is
worth
there
much
of
a
hooraw
made
over
you
when
you
was
there
mention
it
sandy
says
i
coloring
up
a
little
have
had
the
family
see
it
for
any
amount
you
are
a
mind
to
name
change
the
subject
sandy
change
the
do
you
think
of
settling
in
the
california
department
of
bliss
know
i
calculating
on
doing
anything
really
definite
in
that
direction
till
the
family
come
i
thought
i
would
just
look
around
meantime
in
a
quiet
way
and
make
up
my
mind
besides
i
know
a
good
many
dead
people
and
i
was
calculating
to
hunt
them
up
and
swap
a
little
gossip
with
them
about
friends
and
old
times
and
one
thing
or
another
and
ask
them
how
they
like
it
here
as
far
as
they
have
got
i
reckon
my
wife
will
want
to
camp
in
the
california
range
though
because
most
all
her
departed
will
be
there
and
she
likes
to
be
with
folks
she
you
let
her
you
see
what
the
jersey
district
of
heaven
is
for
whites
well
the
californian
district
is
a
thousand
times
worse
it
swarms
with
a
mean
kind
of
your
nearest
white
neighbor
is
likely
to
be
a
million
miles
away
a
man
mostly
of
his
own
sort
and
color
and
language
i
have
come
near
settling
in
the
european
part
of
heaven
once
or
twice
on
that
why
you
sandy
various
reasons
for
one
thing
although
you
plenty
of
whites
there
you
understand
any
of
them
hardly
and
so
you
go
about
as
hungry
for
talk
as
you
do
here
i
like
to
look
at
a
russian
or
a
german
or
an
even
like
to
look
at
a
frenchman
if
i
ever
have
the
luck
to
catch
him
engaged
in
anything
that
cure
the
you
want
is
england
english
district
of
but
it
is
not
so
very
much
better
than
this
end
of
the
heavenly
domain
as
long
as
you
run
across
englishmen
born
this
side
of
three
hundred
years
ago
you
are
all
right
but
the
minute
you
get
back
of
time
the
language
begins
to
fog
up
and
the
further
back
you
go
the
foggier
it
gets
i
had
some
talk
with
one
langland
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
it
was
no
use
i
quite
understand
them
and
they
quite
understand
me
i
have
had
letters
from
them
since
but
it
is
such
broken
english
i
make
it
out
back
of
those
time
the
english
are
just
simply
foreigners
nothing
more
nothing
less
they
talk
danish
german
norman
french
and
sometimes
a
mixture
of
all
three
back
of
they
talk
latin
and
ancient
british
irish
and
gaelic
and
then
back
of
these
come
billions
and
billions
of
pure
savages
that
talk
a
gibberish
that
satan
himself
understand
the
fact
is
where
you
strike
one
man
in
the
english
settlements
that
you
can
understand
you
wade
through
awful
swarms
that
talk
something
you
make
head
nor
tail
of
you
see
every
country
on
earth
has
been
overlaid
so
often
in
the
course
of
a
billion
years
with
different
kinds
of
people
and
different
sorts
of
languages
that
this
sort
of
mongrel
business
was
bound
to
be
the
result
in
says
i
you
see
a
good
many
of
the
great
people
history
tells
about
i
saw
kings
and
all
sorts
of
distinguished
the
kings
rank
just
as
they
did
below
a
body
bring
his
rank
up
here
with
him
divine
right
is
a
earthly
romance
but
it
go
here
kings
drop
down
to
the
general
level
as
soon
as
they
reach
the
realms
of
grace
i
knew
charles
the
second
very
of
the
most
popular
comedians
in
the
english
first
rate
there
are
better
of
that
were
never
heard
of
on
charles
is
making
a
very
good
reputation
indeed
and
is
considered
a
rising
man
richard
the
is
in
the
and
coming
into
considerable
favor
henry
the
eighth
is
a
tragedian
and
the
scenes
where
he
kills
people
are
done
to
the
very
life
henry
the
sixth
keeps
a
you
ever
see
napoleon
sandy
in
the
corsican
range
sometimes
in
the
french
he
always
hunts
up
a
conspicuous
place
and
goes
frowning
around
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
under
his
arm
looking
as
grand
gloomy
and
peculiar
as
his
reputation
calls
for
and
very
much
bothered
because
he
stand
as
high
here
for
a
soldier
as
he
expected
who
stands
higher
a
of
people
never
heard
of
shoemaker
and
and
kind
you
from
goodness
knows
where
that
never
handled
a
sword
or
fired
a
shot
in
their
the
soldiership
was
in
them
though
they
never
had
a
chance
to
show
it
but
here
they
take
their
right
place
and
cæsar
and
napoleon
and
alexander
have
to
take
a
back
seat
the
greatest
military
genius
our
world
ever
produced
was
a
from
somewhere
back
of
during
the
the
name
of
absalom
jones
wherever
he
goes
crowds
flock
to
see
him
you
see
everybody
knows
that
if
he
had
had
a
chance
he
would
have
shown
the
world
some
generalship
that
would
have
made
all
generalship
before
look
like
play
and
work
but
he
never
got
a
chance
he
tried
heaps
of
times
to
enlist
as
a
private
but
he
had
lost
both
thumbs
and
a
couple
of
front
teeth
and
the
recruiting
sergeant
pass
him
however
as
i
say
everybody
knows
now
what
he
have
been
so
they
flock
by
the
million
to
get
a
glimpse
of
him
whenever
they
hear
he
is
going
to
be
anywhere
cæsar
and
hannibal
and
alexander
and
napoleon
are
all
on
his
staff
and
ever
so
many
more
great
generals
but
the
public
hardly
care
to
look
at
when
is
around
boom
there
goes
another
salute
the
off
quarantine
sandy
and
i
put
on
our
things
then
we
made
a
wish
and
in
a
second
we
were
at
the
we
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
ocean
of
space
and
looked
out
over
the
dimness
but
make
out
anything
close
by
us
was
the
grand
on
tier
of
dim
thrones
rising
up
toward
the
zenith
from
each
side
of
it
spread
away
the
tiers
of
seats
for
the
general
public
they
spread
away
for
leagues
and
see
the
ends
they
were
empty
and
still
and
a
cheerful
look
but
looked
dreary
like
a
theatre
before
anybody
turned
down
sandy
says
sit
down
here
and
wait
see
the
head
of
the
procession
come
in
sight
away
off
yonder
pretty
soon
says
i
pretty
lonesome
sandy
i
reckon
a
hitch
somewheres
nobody
but
just
you
and
much
of
a
display
for
the
you
fret
all
right
be
one
more
in
a
little
while
we
noticed
a
sort
of
a
lightish
flush
away
off
on
the
horizon
of
the
torchlight
procession
says
sandy
it
spread
and
got
lighter
and
brighter
soon
it
had
a
strong
glare
like
a
locomotive
headlight
it
kept
on
getting
brighter
and
brighter
till
it
was
like
the
sun
peeping
above
the
at
big
red
rays
shot
high
up
into
the
sky
your
eyes
on
the
grand
stand
and
the
miles
of
says
sandy
listen
for
the
just
then
it
burst
out
like
a
million
thunderstorms
in
one
and
made
the
whole
heavens
rock
then
there
was
a
sudden
and
awful
glare
of
light
all
about
us
and
in
that
very
instant
every
one
of
the
millions
of
seats
was
occupied
and
as
far
as
you
could
see
in
both
directions
was
just
a
solid
pack
of
people
and
the
place
was
all
splendidly
lit
up
it
was
enough
to
take
a
breath
away
sandy
says
is
the
way
we
do
it
here
no
time
fooled
away
nobody
straggling
in
after
the
up
wishing
is
quicker
work
than
travelling
a
quarter
of
a
second
ago
these
folks
were
millions
of
miles
from
here
when
they
heard
the
last
signal
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
wish
and
here
they
the
prodigious
choir
struck
up
we
long
to
hear
thy
voice
to
see
thee
face
to
face
it
was
noble
music
but
the
uneducated
chipped
in
and
spoilt
it
just
as
the
congregations
used
to
do
on
earth
the
head
of
the
procession
began
to
pass
now
and
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
it
swept
along
thick
and
solid
five
hundred
thousand
angels
abreast
and
every
angel
carrying
a
torch
and
whirring
thunder
of
the
wings
made
a
head
ache
you
could
follow
the
line
of
the
procession
back
and
slanting
upward
into
the
sky
far
away
in
a
glittering
snaky
rope
till
it
was
only
a
faint
streak
in
the
distance
the
rush
went
on
and
on
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
sure
enough
along
comes
the
barkeeper
and
then
everybody
rose
and
a
cheer
went
up
that
made
the
heavens
shake
i
tell
you
he
was
all
smiles
and
had
his
halo
tilted
over
one
ear
in
a
cocky
way
and
was
the
most
saint
i
ever
saw
while
he
marched
up
the
steps
of
the
grand
stand
the
choir
struck
up
whole
wide
heaven
groans
and
waits
to
hear
that
there
were
four
gorgeous
tents
standing
side
by
side
in
the
place
of
honor
on
a
broad
railed
platform
in
the
centre
of
the
grand
stand
with
a
shining
guard
of
honor
round
about
them
the
tents
had
been
shut
up
all
this
time
as
the
barkeeper
climbed
along
up
bowing
and
smiling
to
everybody
and
at
last
got
to
the
platform
these
tents
were
jerked
up
aloft
all
of
a
sudden
and
we
saw
four
noble
thrones
of
gold
all
caked
with
jewels
and
in
the
two
middle
ones
sat
old
men
and
in
the
two
others
a
couple
of
the
most
glorious
and
gaudy
giants
with
platter
halos
and
beautiful
armor
all
the
millions
went
down
on
their
knees
and
stared
and
looked
glad
and
burst
out
into
a
joyful
kind
of
murmurs
they
said
archangels
is
splendid
who
can
the
others
be
the
archangels
gave
the
barkeeper
a
stiff
little
military
bow
the
two
old
men
rose
one
of
them
said
and
esau
welcome
thee
and
then
all
the
four
vanished
and
the
thrones
were
empty
the
barkeeper
looked
a
little
disappointed
for
he
was
calculating
to
hug
those
old
people
i
judge
but
it
was
the
gladdest
and
proudest
multitude
you
ever
they
had
seen
moses
and
esau
everybody
was
saying
you
see
them
side
face
was
to
me
but
i
saw
moses
full
in
the
face
just
as
plain
as
i
see
you
this
minute
the
procession
took
up
the
barkeeper
and
moved
on
with
him
again
and
the
crowd
broke
up
and
scattered
as
we
went
along
home
sandy
said
it
was
a
great
success
and
the
barkeeper
would
have
a
right
to
be
proud
of
it
forever
and
he
said
we
were
in
luck
too
said
we
might
attend
receptions
for
forty
thousand
years
to
come
and
not
have
a
chance
to
see
a
brace
of
such
grand
moguls
as
moses
and
esau
we
found
afterwards
that
we
had
come
near
seeing
another
patriarch
and
likewise
a
genuine
prophet
besides
but
at
the
last
moment
they
sent
regrets
sandy
said
there
would
be
a
monument
put
up
there
where
moses
and
esau
had
stood
with
the
date
and
circumstances
and
all
about
the
whole
business
and
travellers
would
come
for
thousands
of
years
and
gawk
at
it
and
climb
over
it
and
scribble
their
names
on
it
footnotes
the
captain
could
not
remember
what
this
word
was
he
said
it
was
in
a
foreign
tongue
