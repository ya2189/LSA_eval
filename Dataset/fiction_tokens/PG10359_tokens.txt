i
uncle
john
farm
how
did
i
happen
to
own
a
farm
asked
uncle
john
interrupting
his
soup
long
enough
to
fix
an
inquiring
glance
upon
major
doyle
who
sat
opposite
by
virtue
of
circumstance
my
dear
sir
replied
the
major
composedly
it
a
part
of
my
duty
in
attending
to
those
affairs
you
wo
look
afther
yourself
to
lend
certain
sums
of
your
money
to
needy
and
ambitious
young
men
who
want
a
start
in
life
oh
uncle
do
you
do
that
exclaimed
miss
patricia
doyle
who
sat
between
her
uncle
and
father
and
kept
an
active
eye
upon
both
so
the
major
says
answered
uncle
john
dryly
and
it
true
asserted
the
other
he
assisted
three
or
four
score
young
men
to
start
in
business
in
the
last
year
to
my
certain
knowledge
by
lending
them
sums
ranging
from
one
to
three
thousand
dollars
and
it
the
most
wasteful
and
extravagant
charity
i
ever
heard
of
but
i
so
glad
cried
patsy
clapping
her
hands
with
a
delighted
gesture
it
a
splendid
way
to
do
good
to
help
young
men
to
get
a
start
in
life
without
capital
you
know
many
a
young
fellow
would
never
get
his
foot
on
the
first
round
of
the
ladder
and
many
will
never
get
it
there
in
any
event
declared
the
major
with
a
shake
of
his
grizzled
head
more
than
half
the
rascals
that
john
helps
go
to
the
dogs
entirely
and
hang
us
up
for
all
they
borrowed
i
told
you
to
help
young
men
remarked
uncle
john
with
a
scowl
at
his
and
how
can
i
tell
whether
they
desarving
or
not
retorted
major
doyle
fiercely
do
ye
want
me
to
become
a
sleuth
or
engage
detectives
to
track
the
objects
of
your
erroneous
philanthropy
i
just
have
to
form
a
judgment
an
take
me
chances
and
whin
a
poor
devil
goes
wrong
i
charge
your
account
with
the
loss
but
some
of
them
must
succeed
ventured
patsy
in
a
conciliatory
tone
some
do
said
john
merrick
and
that
repays
me
for
all
my
trouble
all
throuble
sir
queried
the
major
you
mane
all
throuble
well
and
your
money
and
a
heap
of
throuble
that
confounded
farm
has
cost
me
with
one
thing
and
another
what
of
it
retorted
the
little
round
faced
millionaire
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
staring
fixedly
at
the
other
that
what
i
employ
you
for
now
now
gentlemen
cried
patsy
earnestly
i
have
no
business
conversation
at
the
table
you
know
my
rules
well
enough
this
is
business
asserted
the
major
of
course
not
agreed
uncle
john
mildly
no
one
has
any
business
owning
a
farm
how
did
it
happen
major
the
old
soldier
had
already
forgotten
his
grievance
he
quarreled
persistently
with
his
wealthy
employer
and
whom
he
fairly
adored
to
prevent
the
possibility
as
he
often
confided
to
patsy
of
his
falling
down
and
worshiping
him
john
merrick
was
a
to
be
sure
but
there
were
palliating
circumstances
that
almost
excused
him
he
had
been
so
busily
occupied
in
industry
that
he
never
noticed
how
his
wealth
was
piling
up
until
he
discovered
it
by
accident
then
he
promptly
retired
to
give
the
other
fellows
a
chance
and
he
now
devoted
his
life
to
simple
acts
of
charity
and
the
welfare
and
entertainment
of
his
three
nieces
he
had
rescued
major
doyle
and
his
daughter
from
a
lowly
condition
and
placed
the
former
in
the
great
banking
house
of
isham
marvin
company
where
john
vast
interests
were
protected
and
his
income
wisely
managed
he
had
given
patsy
this
cosy
little
apartment
house
at
willing
square
and
made
his
home
with
her
from
which
circumstance
she
had
come
to
be
recognized
as
his
favorite
niece
john
merrick
was
sixty
years
old
he
was
short
stout
and
with
hair
mild
blue
eyes
and
an
invariably
cheery
smile
simple
in
his
tastes
modest
and
retiring
lacking
the
education
and
refinements
of
polite
society
but
shrewd
and
experienced
in
the
affairs
of
the
world
the
little
man
found
his
greatest
enjoyment
in
the
family
circle
that
he
had
been
instrumental
in
founding
being
no
longer
absorbed
in
business
he
had
come
to
detest
its
every
detail
and
so
allowed
his
bankers
to
care
for
his
fortune
and
his
to
disburse
his
income
while
he
himself
strove
to
enjoy
life
in
a
shy
and
boyish
fashion
that
was
as
unusual
in
a
man
of
his
wealth
as
it
was
admirable
he
had
never
married
patricia
was
the
apple
of
uncle
john
eye
and
the
one
goddess
enshrined
in
her
doting
father
heart
glancing
at
her
as
she
sat
here
at
table
in
her
plain
muslin
gown
a
stranger
would
be
tempted
to
wonder
why
she
was
freckled
as
a
robin
egg
and
but
her
blue
eyes
were
beautiful
and
they
sparkled
with
a
combination
of
saucy
mischief
and
kindly
consideration
for
others
that
lent
her
face
an
indescribable
charm
everyone
loved
patsy
doyle
and
people
would
gaze
longer
at
her
and
dancing
eyes
than
upon
many
a
more
handsome
but
less
attractive
face
she
was
nearly
seventeen
years
old
not
very
tall
and
her
form
to
speak
charitably
was
more
neat
than
slender
a
while
ago
said
the
major
resuming
the
conversation
as
he
carved
the
roast
a
young
fellow
came
to
me
who
had
invented
a
new
sort
of
pump
to
inflate
rubber
tires
he
wanted
capital
to
patent
the
pump
and
put
it
on
the
market
the
thing
looked
pretty
good
john
so
i
lent
him
a
thousand
of
your
money
quite
right
returned
uncle
john
nodding
but
pretty
soon
he
came
back
with
a
sad
tale
he
was
in
a
bad
fix
another
fellow
was
contesting
his
patent
and
fighting
hard
to
head
him
off
it
would
take
a
lot
of
money
to
fight
back
three
thousand
at
least
but
he
was
decent
about
it
after
all
his
father
had
left
him
a
little
farm
at
millville
he
could
say
what
it
was
worth
but
there
were
sixty
acres
and
some
good
buildings
and
he
would
deed
it
to
you
as
security
if
you
would
let
him
have
three
thousand
more
so
you
took
the
farm
and
gave
him
the
money
i
did
sir
perhaps
i
am
to
blame
but
i
liked
the
young
looks
he
was
and
frank
and
believed
in
his
pump
i
did
more
at
the
climax
of
the
struggle
i
gave
another
thousand
making
five
thousand
in
all
well
it
gone
john
and
you
got
the
farm
the
other
fellows
were
too
clever
for
my
young
friend
joseph
wegg
and
knocked
out
his
patent
i
so
sorry
said
patsy
sympathetically
the
major
coughed
it
not
an
unusual
tale
my
dear
especially
when
john
advances
the
money
he
replied
what
became
of
the
young
man
asked
the
girl
he
a
competent
chauffeur
and
so
he
went
to
work
driving
an
automobile
where
is
millville
inquired
uncle
john
thoughtfully
somewhere
at
the
north
of
the
state
i
believe
have
you
investigated
the
farm
at
all
i
looked
up
a
real
estate
dealer
living
at
millville
and
wrote
him
about
the
wegg
farm
he
said
if
any
one
wanted
the
place
very
badly
it
might
sell
for
three
thousand
dollars
humph
but
his
best
information
was
to
the
effect
that
no
one
wanted
it
at
all
patsy
laughed
poor
uncle
john
she
said
the
little
man
however
was
serious
for
a
time
he
ate
with
great
deliberation
and
revolved
an
interesting
thought
in
his
mind
years
ago
said
he
i
lived
in
a
country
town
and
i
love
the
smell
of
the
meadows
and
the
hum
of
the
bees
in
the
orchards
any
orchards
at
my
farm
major
do
know
sir
pretty
soon
continued
uncle
john
it
going
to
be
dreadfully
hot
in
new
york
and
we
have
to
get
away
seashore
the
place
remarked
the
major
atlantic
city
or
swampscott
or
rubbish
growled
the
other
man
impatiently
the
girls
and
i
have
just
come
from
europe
we
had
enough
sea
to
last
us
all
season
at
least
what
we
pine
for
is
country
life
pure
milk
apple
trees
and
new
mown
hay
we
uncle
said
patsy
yes
my
dear
a
couple
of
months
on
the
farm
will
do
all
of
my
nieces
good
beth
is
still
with
louise
you
know
and
they
must
find
the
city
deadly
dull
just
now
the
farm
the
thing
and
the
major
can
run
up
to
see
us
for
a
couple
of
weeks
in
the
hot
weather
and
we
all
have
a
glorious
lazy
time
and
we
can
take
mary
along
to
do
the
cooking
suggested
patsy
entering
into
the
idea
enthusiastically
and
eat
in
our
said
uncle
john
with
a
glowing
face
and
have
a
cow
and
some
pigs
cried
the
girl
pah
said
the
major
scornfully
you
talk
as
if
it
were
a
real
farm
instead
of
a
place
no
one
would
have
as
a
gift
uncle
john
looked
sober
again
anyone
live
on
the
place
major
he
inquired
i
believe
not
it
gone
to
ruin
and
decay
the
last
few
years
but
it
could
be
put
into
shape
perhaps
so
at
an
expense
that
will
add
to
your
loss
never
mind
that
if
you
want
farm
life
why
do
you
rent
a
respectable
farm
demanded
the
major
no
this
is
my
farm
i
own
it
and
it
my
bounded
duty
to
live
on
it
said
uncle
john
stubbornly
write
to
that
real
estate
fellow
at
millville
tomorrow
and
tell
him
to
have
the
place
fixed
up
and
put
into
order
as
quickly
as
possible
tell
him
to
buy
some
cows
and
pigs
and
chickens
and
hire
a
man
to
look
after
them
also
a
horse
and
buggy
some
saddle
horses
go
slow
john
do
leave
such
a
job
to
a
country
real
estate
dealer
if
i
remember
right
the
fellow
wrote
like
a
blacksmith
if
you
want
horses
and
rigs
let
hutchinson
send
you
down
the
right
sort
with
an
experienced
groom
and
stable
hands
but
i
not
sure
there
will
be
a
place
to
put
them
oh
uncle
exclaimed
patsy
do
let
us
have
all
those
luxuries
let
us
live
a
simple
life
on
the
farm
and
not
degrade
its
charms
by
adding
city
fixin
the
cow
and
the
chickens
are
all
right
but
let
cut
out
the
horses
until
we
get
there
do
you
know
dear
that
a
big
establishment
means
lots
of
servants
and
servants
mean
worry
and
strife
i
want
to
let
down
the
bars
for
the
cow
when
she
moos
and
milk
her
myself
it
takes
a
skilled
mechanic
to
milk
a
cow
objected
the
major
but
patsy
right
cried
her
uncle
with
conviction
we
do
want
any
frills
at
all
just
tell
your
man
major
to
put
the
place
into
good
living
condition
patrichia
softly
remarked
the
major
with
an
admiring
glance
at
his
small
daughter
has
more
sinse
in
her
frizzled
head
than
both
of
us
put
together
if
she
had
more
than
you
retorted
uncle
john
with
a
grin
put
a
candle
inside
her
noodle
and
call
her
a
chapter
ii
the
agent
the
major
hunted
up
the
real
estate
dealer
former
letter
as
soon
as
he
reached
his
office
next
morning
the
printed
somewhat
blurred
because
too
much
ink
had
been
used
read
as
follows
marshall
mcmahon
mcnutt
real
estate
dealer
horses
to
pasture
by
the
week
or
month
also
plymouth
rock
hens
road
commissioner
agent
for
radley
lives
of
the
saints
insurance
and
watermelons
my
specialty
millville
mount
county
the
major
shook
his
head
doubtfully
as
he
read
the
above
announcement
but
mcnutt
was
the
only
known
person
to
whom
he
could
appeal
to
carry
out
john
merrick
orders
so
he
dictated
the
following
letter
john
merrick
the
present
owner
of
the
wegg
farm
at
millville
desires
to
spend
his
summer
vacation
on
the
premises
and
therefore
requests
you
to
have
the
house
and
grounds
put
in
shape
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
notify
me
directly
the
work
is
done
have
the
house
thoroughly
cleaned
the
grass
mowed
around
it
and
the
barns
and
outbuildings
repaired
wherever
it
may
be
necessary
you
are
also
instructed
to
procure
for
merrick
use
a
good
jersey
cow
some
pigs
and
a
dozen
or
so
barnyard
fowls
as
several
ladies
will
accompany
the
owner
and
reside
with
him
on
the
place
he
would
like
you
to
report
what
necessary
furniture
if
any
will
be
required
for
their
comfort
send
your
bill
to
me
and
it
will
receive
prompt
after
several
days
this
reply
came
doyle
you
must
be
crazy
as
a
loon
send
me
fifty
cold
dollars
as
an
evvidence
of
good
fayth
and
i
wull
see
what
can
be
done
old
hucks
is
livin
on
the
place
yit
do
you
want
him
to
git
out
or
what
yours
fer
a
square
deal
marshall
mcmahon
john
said
the
major
exhibiting
this
letter
you
on
the
wrong
tack
the
man
is
justified
in
thinking
we
crazy
give
up
this
idea
and
think
of
something
else
to
bother
me
but
the
new
proprietor
of
the
wegg
farm
was
obdurate
during
the
past
week
he
had
indulged
in
sundry
sly
purchases
which
had
been
shipped
in
his
name
to
chazy
junction
the
nearest
railway
station
to
millville
therefore
the
die
had
been
cast
as
far
as
merrick
was
concerned
for
the
purchases
were
by
this
time
at
the
farm
awaiting
him
and
he
could
not
back
out
without
sacrificing
them
they
included
a
set
of
gardening
tools
several
hammocks
croquet
and
tennis
sets
and
a
remarkable
collection
of
fishing
tackle
which
the
man
had
declared
fitted
to
catch
anything
that
swam
from
a
whale
to
a
minnow
also
uncle
john
decided
to
dress
the
part
of
a
rural
gentleman
and
ordered
his
tailor
to
prepare
a
corduroy
fishing
costume
a
suit
of
white
flannel
one
of
khaki
and
some
blue
jean
overalls
with
apron
front
which
when
made
to
order
by
the
obliging
tailor
cost
about
eighteen
dollars
a
suit
to
forego
the
farm
meant
to
forego
all
these
luxuries
and
merrick
was
unequal
to
the
sacrifice
why
only
that
same
morning
he
had
bought
a
charming
cottage
piano
and
shipped
it
to
the
junction
for
patsy
use
that
seemed
to
settle
the
matter
definitely
to
be
balked
of
his
summer
vacation
on
his
own
farm
was
a
thing
merrick
would
not
countenance
for
a
moment
give
me
that
letter
major
he
said
i
run
this
enterprise
myself
the
major
resigned
with
a
sigh
of
relief
uncle
john
promptly
sent
the
real
estate
agent
a
draft
for
five
hundred
dollars
with
instructions
to
get
the
farm
in
shape
for
occupancy
at
the
earliest
possible
day
if
old
hucks
is
a
farm
hand
and
a
bachelor
he
wrote
let
him
stay
till
i
come
and
look
him
over
if
he
a
married
man
and
has
a
family
chuck
him
out
at
once
i
sure
you
are
a
man
of
good
taste
and
judgment
look
over
the
furniture
in
the
house
and
telegraph
me
what
condition
it
is
in
everything
about
the
place
must
be
made
cozy
and
comfortable
but
i
wish
to
avoid
an
appearance
of
vulgarity
or
extravagance
the
answer
to
this
was
a
characteristic
telegram
on
the
bum
like
everything
else
will

i
can
uncle
john
did
not
display
this
discouraging
report
to
patsy
or
her
father
a
little
thought
on
the
matter
decided
him
to
rectify
the
deficiencies
in
so
far
as
it
lay
in
his
power
he
visited
a
large
establishment
making
a
specialty
of
furnishing
homes
complete
and
ordered
a
new
kitchen
outfit
including
a
modern
range
a
mission
style
outfit
for
a
dainty
summer
furniture
for
the
five
chambers
to
be
occupied
by
his
three
nieces
the
major
and
himself
and
a
variety
of
lawn
benches
chairs
etc
look
after
the
details
he
said
to
the
dealer
do
neglect
anything
that
is
pretty
or
useful
i
wo
sir
replied
the
man
who
knew
his
customer
was
the
great
john
merrick
who
could
furnish
a
city
complete
if
he
wished
to
and
not
count
the
cost
everything
was
to
be
shipped
in
haste
to
the
junction
and
uncle
john
wrote
mcnutt
to
have
it
delivered
promptly
to
the
farm
and
put
in
order
as
soon
as
things
are
in
shape
he
wrote
wire
me
to
that
effect
and
i
come
down
but
do
let
any
grass
grow
under
your
feet
i
a
man
who
requires
prompt
service
the
days
were
already
getting
uncomfortably
warm
and
the
little
man
was
nervously
anxious
to
see
his
farm
so
were
the
nieces
for
that
matter
who
were
always
interested
in
the
things
that
interested
their
eccentric
uncle
besides
patricia
doyle
whom
we
have
already
introduced
these
nieces
were
miss
louise
merrick
who
had
just
celebrated
her
eighteenth
birthday
and
miss
elizabeth
or
beth
de
graf
now
well
past
fifteen
beth
lived
in
a
small
town
in
ohio
but
was
then
visiting
her
city
cousin
louise
so
that
both
girls
were
not
only
available
but
eager
to
accompany
uncle
john
to
his
new
domain
and
assist
him
to
enjoy
his
summer
outing

millville
hears
exciting
news
millville
is
rather
difficult
to
locate
on
the
map
for
the
railroads
found
it
impossible
to
run
a
line
there
junction
the
nearest
station
is
several
miles
away
and
the
wagon
road
ascends
the
foothills
every
step
of
the
distance
finally
you
pass
between
mount
parnassus
whoever
named
it
that
and
little
bill
hill
and
find
yourself
on
an
almost
level
plateau
some
four
miles
in
diameter
with
a
placid
lake
in
the
center
and
a
fringe
of
tall
pines
around
the
edge
at
the
south
where
tower
the
northern
sentries
of
the
adirondacks
a
stream
called
little
bill
creek
comes
splashing
and
dashing
over
the
rocks
to
force
its
way
noisily
into
the
lake
when
it
emerges
again
it
is
humble
and
sedate
and
flows
smoothly
to
hooker
falls
from
whence
it
soon
joins
a
tributary
that
leads
it
to
far
away
champlain
millville
is
built
where
the
little
bill
rushes
into
the
lake
the
old
mill
with
its
race
and
still
grinds
wearily
the
scanty
dole
of
grain
fed
into
its
hoppers
and
silas
caldwell
takes
his
toll
and
earns
his
modest
living
just
as
his
father
did
before
him
and
little
bill
thompson
did
before
him
above
the
mill
a
rickety
wooden
bridge
spans
the
stream
for
here
the
highway
from
chary
junction
reaches
the
village
of
millville
and
passes
the
wooden
structures
grouped
on
either
side
its
main
street
on
the
way
to
thompson
crossing
nine
miles
farther
along
the
town
boasts
exactly
eleven
buildings
not
counting
the
mill
which
being
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
bill
can
hardly
be
called
a
part
of
millville

you
must

they

but
each
has
a
little
ground
of
its
own
on
the
other
side
of
the

scarcely
a
quarter
of

up

but
it
is
in
millville
for
all
that
there
a
cross
lane
just
beyond
pearson
leading
east
and
west
and
a
mile
to
westward
is
the
wegg
farm
in
the
wildest
part
of
the
foothills
it
is
a
poor
farming
country
around
millville
strangers
often
wonder
how
the
little
shops
of
the
town
earn
a
living
for
their
proprietors
but
it
does
require
a
great
deal
to
enable
these
simple
folk
to
live
the
tourist
seldom
penetrates
these
inaccessible
foothills
the
roads
are
too
rough
and
primitive
for
automobiles
so
millville
is
shamefully
neglected
and
civilization
halted
there
some
half
a
century
ago
however
there
was
a
genuine
sensation
in
store
for
this
isolated
hamlet
and
it
was
the
more
welcome
because
anything
in
the
way
of
a
sensation
had
for
many
years
avoided
the
neighborhood
marshall
mcmahon
mcnutt
or
as
he
was
more
familiarly
called
by
those
few
who
respected
him
most
highly
marsh
mcnutt
and
sundry
other
appellations
by
those
who
respected
him
not
at
all
became
the
recipient
of
a
letter
from
new
york
announcing
the
intention
of
a
certain
john
merrick
the
new
owner
of
the
wegg
farm
to
spend
the
summer
on
the
place
mcnutt
was
an
undersized
man
of
about
forty
with
a
beardless
face
scraggly
hair
and
eyes
that
were
big
light
blue
and
remarkably
protruding
the
stare
of
those
eyes
was
impenetrable
because
observers
found
it
embarrassing
to
look
at
them
mac
friends
had
a
trick
of
looking
away
when
they
spoke
to
him
but
children
gazed
fascinated
at
the
expressionless
blue
eyeballs
and
regarded
their
owner
with
awe
the
real
estate
agent
was
considered
an
enterprising
man
by
his
neighbors
and
a
poor
stick
by
his
wife
he
had
gone
to
school
at
thompson
crossing
in
his
younger
days
had
a
call
to
preach
but
failed
because
he
could
get
religion
inherited
a
farm
from
his
uncle
and
married
sam
cotting
sister
whose
tongue
and
temper
were
so
sharp
that
everyone
marveled
at
the
man
temerity
in
acquiring
them
finally
he
had
lost
one
foot
in
a
mowing
machine
and
the
accident
destroyed
his
further
usefulness
to
the
extent
of
inducing
him
to
abandon
the
farm
and
move
into
town
here
he
endeavored
to
find
something
to
do
to
eke
out
his
meagre
income
so
he
raised
thoroughbred
plymouth
rocks
selling
eggs
for
hatching
to
the
farmers
doctored
sick
horses
and
pastured
them
in
the
lot
back
of
his
barn
the
rear
end
of
which
was
devoted
to
watermelons
in
season
sold
subscription
books
to
farmers
who
came
to
the
mill
or
the
village
store
was
elected
road
commissioner
and
bossed
the
neighbors
when
they
had
to
work
out
their
and
turned
his
hand
to
any
other
affairs
that
offered
a
penny
recompense
the
real
estate
business
was
what
seth
davis
labeled
a
blobbering
bluff
for
no
property
had
changed
hands
in
the
neighborhood
in
a
score
of
years
except
the
lot
back
of
the
mill
which
was
traded
for
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
the
wegg
farm
which
had
been
sold
without
the
agent
knowledge
or
consent
the
only
surprising
thing
about
the
sale
of
the
wegg
farm
was
that
anyone
would
buy
it
captain
wegg
had
died
three
years
before
and
his
son
joe
wandered
south
to
albany
worked
his
way
through
a
technical
school
and
then
disappeared
in
the
mazes
of
new
york
so
the
homestead
seemed
abandoned
altogether
except
for
the
huckses
when
captain
wegg
died
old
hucks
his
hired
man
and
hucks
blind
wife
nora
were
the
only
dependents
on
the
place
and
the
ancient
couple
had
naturally
remained
there
when
joe
scorned
his
inheritance
and
ran
away
after
the
sale
they
had
no
authority
to
remain
but
were
under
no
compulsion
to
move
out
so
they
clung
to
their
old
quarters
when
mcnutt
was
handed
his
letter
by
the
postmaster
and
storekeeper
he
stared
at
its
contents
in
a
bewildered
way
that
roused
the
loungers
to
amused
laughter
what
up
peggy
called
nick
thorne
from
his
seat
on
the
counter
somebody
gone
me
hooks
an
left
ye
a
fortun
peggy
was
one
of
mcnutt
most
popular
nicknames
acquired
because
he
wore
a
short
length
of
pine
where
his
absent
foot
should
have
been
not
quite
was
the
agent
slow
reply
but
here
the
blamedest
funniest
communicate
a
man
ever
got
it
from
some
critter
that
knows
the
man
what
bought
the
wegg
farm
let
hear
it
remarked
cotting
the
a
fat
individual
with
a
bald
head
who
was
counting
matches
from
a
shelf
into
the
public
he
allowed
the
boys
just
twenty
free
matches
a
day
so
the
agent
read
the
letter
in
an
uncertain
halting
voice
and
when
he
had
finished
it
the
little
group
stared
at
one
another
for
a
time
in
thoughtful
silence

gravely
i

real
bloods
here
to
squander
their
substance
well
here
a
perposal
to

all

said
mcnutt
but
the
question
is
does
he
know
what
he
runnin
up
agin
and
what
cost
to
do
all
the
idiotic
things
as
he

regarded
him
admiringly
so
the
energetic
little
man
stumped
away
to
indite
his
characteristic
letter
to
major
doyle
if
the
first
communication
had
startled
the
little
village
the
second
fairly
plunged
it
into
a
panic
of
excitement
peggy
hand
trembled
as
he
held
out
the
five
hundred
dollar
draft
and
glared
from
it
to
his
cronies
with
a
white
face
jehu
gasped
nick
thorne
is

the
paper
was
passed

around
and

succession

send

suggested
cotting
he
seen
more
o

sort
money
than
any
of

the
widow
clarke
boy
who
was
present
ran
breathlessly
to
fetch
the
hardware
dealer
who
answered
the
summons
when
he
learned
that
peggy
mcnutt
had
received
a
check
for
five
hundred
dollars
west
was
a
tall
lean
man
with
shrewd
eyes
covered
by
horn
spectacles
and
a
stubby
gray
mustache
he
was
the
potentate
of
the
town
and
reputed
to
be
worth
at
a
conservative
estimate
in
the
neighborhood
of
ten
thousand
dollars
er
more
fer
that
matter
fer
bob
ai
tellin
his
business
to
nobody
hardware
and
implements
were
acknowledged
to
be
paying
merchandise
and
west
lent
money
on
farm
mortgages
besides
he
was
a
quiet
man
had
a
good
library
in
his
comfortable
rooms
over
the
store
and
took
the
only
new
york
paper
that
found
its
way
into
millville
after
a
glance
at
the
remittance
he
said
it

mcnutt
where
did
you
get
it
a
lunitic
named
john
merrick
him
that
bought
the
wegg
farm
sent
it
on
here
his
letter
bob
the
hardware
dealer
read
it
carefully
and
gave
a
low
whistle
there
may
be
more
than
one
john
merrick
he
said
thoughtfully
but
i
heard
of
one
who
is
many
times
a
millionaire
and
a
power
in
the
financial
world
what
will
you
do
for
him
mcnutt
to
expend
this
money
properly
if
i
know
answered
the
man
his
eyes
bulging
with
a
helpless
look
what
thunder
i
do
bob
west
smiled
i
do
wish
to
interfere
in
business
matters
said
he
but
it
is
plainly
evident
that
the
new
owner
wishes
the
farm
house
put
into
such
shape
that
it
will
be
comfortable
for
a
man
accustomed
to
modern
luxuries
you
do
know
much
about
such
things
mac
and
merrick
has
made
a
blunder
in
employing
your
services
in
such
a
delicate
matter
but
do
the
best
you
can
ride
across
to
the
wegg
place
and
look
it
over
then
get
taft
the
carpenter
to
fix
up
whatever
is
necessary
i
sell
you
the
lumber
and
nails
and
you
got
more
money
than
you
can
probably
use
telegraph
merrick
frankly
how
you
find
things
but
remember
the
report
must
not
be
based
upon
your
own
mode
of
life
but
upon
that
of
a
man
of
wealth
and
refinement
especially
he
must
be
posted
about
the
condition
of
the
furniture
which
i
can
guess
is
to
his
needs
how
hucks
asked
the
agent
they
all
hung
eagerly
on
west
reply
for
old
hucks
was
a
general
favorite
the
fact
that
the
old
retainer
of
the
weggs
had
a
blind
wife
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
devoted
made
the
proposition
of
his
leaving
the
farm
one
of
intense
interest
old
hucks
and
his
patient
wife
had
not
been
so
much
hired
help
as
a
part
of
the
wegg
establishment
and
it
was
doubtful
if
they
had
ever
received
any
wages
it
was
certain
that
hucks
had
not
a
dollar
in
the
world
at
the
present
time
and
if
turned
out
of
their
old
home
the
ancient
couple
must
either
starve
or
go
to
the
poorhouse
say
nothing
further
about
old
hucks
or
his
wife
to
merrick
advised
west
gravely
when
the
owner
comes
he
will
need
servants
and
hucks
is
a
very
capable
old
fellow
let
that
problem
rest
until
the
time
comes
for
solution
if
the
old
folks
are
to
be
turned
out
make
john
merrick
do
it
it
will
put
the
responsibility
on
his
shoulders
by
dum
yer
right
bob
exclaimed
mcnutt
slapping
the
counter
with
his
usual
impulsiveness
i
do
the
best
i
kin
for
the
rich
man
let
the
poor
man
alone
after
an
examination
of
the
farm
house
and
other
buildings
which
seemed
in
his
eyes
almost
palatial
and
a
conference
with
alonzo
taft
the
carpenter
the
agent
began
to
feel
that
his
task
was
going
to
prove
an
easy
one
he
purchased
a
fine
jersey
cow
of
will
johnson
sold
his
own
flock
of
plymouth
rocks
at
a
high
price
to
merrick
and
hired
ned
long
to
work
around
the
yard
and
help
hucks
mow
the
grass
and
clean
up
generally
but
now
his
real
trouble
and
bewilderment
began
a
carload
of
new
furniture
and
fixin
was
sidetracked
at
the
junction
and
mcnutt
was
ordered
to
get
it
unloaded
and
carted
to
the
farm
without
delay
there
were
four
loads
of
the
truck
altogether
and
when
it
was
all
dumped
into
the
big
empty
barn
at
the
wegg
farm
the
poor
agent
had
no
idea
what
to
do
with
it
see
here
said
nick
thorne
who
had
done
the
hauling
you
got
to
let
a
woman
inter
this
deal
peggy
that
what
my
wife
says

she
spile

rotten
apple

why

likely

parts

like
a
rose
in
spring
but
folks
like
us
hai
got
no
call
to
tech
it
you
fetch
peggy
sighed
he
was
keeping
track
of
his
time
and
charging
john
merrick
at
the
rate
of
two
dollars
a
day
being
firmly
resolved
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
was
shining
and
absorb
as
much
of
the
money
placed
in
his
hands
as
possible
to
let
into
this
deal
and
be
obliged
to
pay
her
wages
was
an
undesirable
thing
to
do
yet
he
reflected
that
it
might
be
wise
to
adopt
nick
thorne
suggestion
so
next
morning
he
drove
the
liveryman
sorrel
mare
out
to
crossing
where
the
brick
stood
on
one
corner
and
will
thompson
residence
on
another
a
mile
away
could
be
seen
the
spires
of
the
little
church
at
hooker
falls
mcnutt
hitched
his
horse
to
thompson
post
walked
up
the
neat
pebbled
path
and
knocked
at
the
door
ethel
in
he
asked
of
the
woman
who
after
some
delay
answered
his
summons
she
in
the
garden
weedin
i
go
said
the
agent
the
garden
was
a
bower
of
roses
among
them
stood
a
slender
girl
in
a
checked
gingham
tying
vines
to
a
trellis
ethel
said
the
visitor
the
girl
smiled
at
him
she
was
not
very
pretty
because
her
face
was
long
and
wan
and
her
nose
a
bit
but
her
golden
hair
sparkled
in
the
sun
like
a
mass
of
spun
gold
and
the
smile
was
winning
in
its
unconscious
sweetness
surely
such
attractions
were
enough
for
a
mere
country
girl
ethel
thompson
had
however
another
claim
to
distinction
she
had
been
eddicated
as
her
neighbors
acknowledged
in
awed
tones
and
took
a
diploma
from
a
college
school
at
troy
young
as
she
was
ethel
had
taught
school
for
two
years
and
might
have
a
life
tenure
if
she
cared
to
retain
the
position
as
he
looked
at
her
neat
gown
and
noted
the
grace
and
ease
of
her
movements
the
agent
acknowledged
that
he
had
really
come
to
the
right
shop
to
untangle
his
perplexing
difficulties
new
folks
is
comin
to
the
wegg
farm
he
announced
as
a
beginning
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
queerly
has
joe
sold
the
place
she
asked
near
a
year
ago
some
fool
rich
man
has
bought
it
and
is
comin
down
here
to
spend
his
summer
vacation
he
says
here
read
his
letters
they
explain
it
better
i
can
her
hand
trembled
a
little
as
she
took
the
letters
mcnutt
pulled
from
his
pocket
then
she
sat
upon
a
bench
and
read
them
all
through
by
that
time
she
had
regained
her
composure
the
gentleman
is
somewhat
eccentric
she
remarked
but
he
will
make
no
mistake
in
coming
to
this
delightful
place
if
he
wishes
quiet
and
rest
do
know
what
he
after
i
sure
replied
the
man
but
he
sent
down
enough
furniture
an
truck
to
stock
a
hotel
an
i
want
to
know
ef

girl
laughed
when

the
folks

she
asked

sent
some
money
down
to
pay
fer

responded
the
girl
in
a
cheery
tone
it
will
delight

to
handle

nora
and
tom
still
there
oh

i

i
glad
of

brightly
perhaps

may
arrange
it
so
they
can
stay
old
nora
a
dear
but
she
blind
she
knows
every
inch
of
the
wegg
house
and

thoroughly
than
many
who
can
see
when
do
you
want
me
peggy
soon
you
kin
come
then
i
be
over
tomorrow
morning
at
that
moment
a
wild
roar
like
that
of
a
beast
came
from
the
house
the
sad
faced
woman
ran
down
a
passage
a
door
slammed
and
then
all
was
quiet
again
mcnutt
hitched
uneasily
from
the
wooden
foot
to
the
good
one
how
ol
will
he
enquired
in
a
low
voice
grandfather
about
as
usual
replied
the
girl
with
trained
composure
still
crazy
as
a
bedbug
at
times
he
becomes
a
bit
violent
but
those
attacks
never
last
long
do
i
could
see
him
ventured
the
agent
still
in
hesitating
tones
oh
no
he
has
seen
no
visitor
since
captain
wegg
died
well
ethel
see
you
at
the
farm
in
the
mornin
the
girl
sat
for
a
long
time
after
mcnutt
had
driven
away
seemingly
lost
in
revery
poor
joe
she
sighed
at
last
poor
foolish
joe
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
him
chapter
iv
ethel
makes
preparation
the
wegg
homestead
stood
near
the
edge
of
a
thin
forest
of
pines
through
which
little
bill
creek
wound
noisily
on
its
way
to
the
lake
at
the
left
was
a
slope
on
which
grew
a
neglected
orchard
of
apple
and
pear
trees
their
trunks
rough
and
gnarled
by
the
struggle
to
outlive
many
severe
winters
there
was
a
rude
rocky
lane
in
front
separated
from
the
yard
by
a
fence
of
split
pine
rails
but
the
ground
surrounding
the
house
was
rich
enough
to
grow
a
profusion
of
june
grass
the
farm
was
of
very
little
value
back
of
the
yard
was
a
fairly
good
berry
patch
but
aside
from
that
some
two
acres
of
corn
and
a
small
strip
of
timothy
represented
all
that
was
fertile
of
the
sixty
acres
the
place
contained
but
the
house
itself
was
the
most
imposing
dwelling
for
many
miles
around
just
why
that
silent
old
jonas
wegg
had
come
into
this
secluded
wilderness
to
locate
was
a
problem
the
millville
people
had
never
yet
solved
certainly
it
was
with
no
idea
of
successfully
farming
the
land
he
had
acquired
for
half
of
it
was
stony
and
half
covered
by
pine
forest
but
the
house
he
constructed
was
the
wonder
of
the
in
its
day
it
was
a
big
building
the
lower
half
being
jest
cobblestones
as
the
neighbors
sneeringly
remarked
while
the
upper
half
was
decent
pine
lumber
the
lower
floor
of
this
main
building
consisted
of
a
single
room
with
a
great
fireplace
in
the
center
of
the
rear
wall
and
narrow
windows
at
the
front
and
sides
there
was
a
small
porch
in
front
with
a
great
entrance
door
of
carved
dark
wood
of
a
foreign
look
which
the
captain
had
brought
from
some
port
in
massachusetts
a
stair
in
one
corner
of
the
big
living
room
led
to
the
second
story
where
four
large
were
arranged
these
had
once
been
plastered
and
papered
but
the
had
all
faded
into
dull
neutral
tints
and
in
one
of
the
rooms
a
big
patch
of
plaster
had
fallen
away
from
the
ceiling
showing
the
bare
lath
only
one
of
the
upstairs
rooms
had
ever
been
furnished
and
it
now
contained
a
corded
wooden
bedstead
a
cheap
pine
table
and
one
chair
indeed
the
main
building
which
i
have
briefly
described
had
not
been
in
use
for
many
years
sometimes
when
captain
wegg
was
alive
he
would
build
a
log
fire
in
the
great
fireplace
on
a
winter
evening
and
sit
before
it
in
silent
mood
until
far
into
the
night
and
once
when
his
young
wife
had
first
occupied
the
new
house
the
big
room
had
acquired
a
fairly
cosy
and
comfortable
appearance
but
it
had
always
been
sparsely
furnished
and
most
of
the
decadent
furniture
that
now
littered
it
was
useless
and
unlovely
the
big
wooden
at
the
back
and
the
right
wing
were
at
this
time
the
only
really
habitable
parts
of
the
mansion
the
had
an
entrance
from
the
living
room
but
old
hucks
and
nora
his
wife
used
the
back
door
entirely
it
consisted
of
a
large
and
cheerful
kitchen
and
two
rooms
off
it
one
used
as
a
store
room
and
the
other
as
a
sleeping
chamber
for
the
aged
couple
the
right
wing
was
also
constructed
of
and
had
formerly
been
captain
wegg
own
chamber
after
his
death
his
only
child
joe
then
a
boy
of
sixteen
had
taken
possession
of
his
father
room
but
after
a
day
or
two
he
had
suddenly
quitted
the
house
where
he
was
born
and
plunged
into
the
great
outside
world
to
seek
his
fortune
it
was
said
decidedly
there
was
no
future
for
the
boy
here
in
the
cities
lurks
opportunity
when
ethel
thompson
arrived
in
the
early
morning
that
followed
her
interview
with
mcnutt
she
rode
her
pony
through
the
gap
in
the
rail
fence
across
the
june
grass
and
around
to
the
back
door
on
a
bench
beside
the
pump
an
old
woman
sat
shelling
peas
her
form
was
thin
but
erect
and
her
hair
snowy
white
she
moved
with
alertness
and
as
the
girl
dismounted
and
approached
her
she
raised
her
head
and
turned
a
pleasant
face
with
sightless
gray
eyes
upon
her
visitor
good
morning
ethel
dear
she
said
i
knew
the
pony
whinney

early
today

rich

he
says
most

strips
o
wood
nailed
over
but
some

tom

another
look

new

nora
we
both
worried
ethel
our
time

no
mistake
peggy
mcnutt
says
as
he
had
real
orders
to
turn
hucks
out

nabobs
arrove
then

guess

our
mighty
quick
i
not
sure
of
that
said
the
girl
thoughtfully
they
must
be
indeed
to
turn
you
out
into
the
world
and
you
are
both
capable
people
and
would
serve
the
city
folks
faithfully
and
well
it
my
eyes
replied
the
other
in
a
simple
tone
hucks
might
wait
on
the
nabobs
all
right
but
they
wo
a
blind
woman
a
minute
i
sure
an
hucks
ruther
be
with
me
in
the
than
to
let
me
go
alone
right
y
air
nora
girl
cried
a
merry
voice
and
as
the
blind
woman
looked
up
with
a
smile
ethel
turned
around
to
face
old
hucks
a
tall
man
but
much
bent
at
the
shoulders
and
limping
in
one
leg
from
an
old
hurt
aggravated
by
rheumatism
his
form
was
as
gnarled
as
the
in
the
and
twisted
almost
as
fantastically
but
the
head
uplifted
from
the
stooped
shoulders
and
held
a
little
to
one
side
was
remarkable
enough
to
attract
attention
it
had
scanty
white
locks
and
a
fringe
of
white
whiskers
under
the
chin
and
these
framed
a
smiling
face
and
features
that
were
extremely
winning
in
expression
no
one
could
remember
ever
seeing
old
hucks
when
he
was
not
smiling
and
the
expression
was
neither
set
nor
inane
but
so
cheery
and
bright
that
you
were
tempted
to
smile
with
him
without
knowing
why
for
dress
he
wore
a
much
patched
pair
of
woolen
trousers
and
a
hickory
shirt
of
faded
blue
with
rough
top
boots
and
a
dilapidated
straw
hat
that
looked
as
if
it
might
have
outlived
several
generations
as
ethel
greeted
the
man
she
looked
him
over
carefully
and
sighed
at
the
result
for
certainly
as
far
as
personal
appearances
went
he
seemed
as
unlikely
a
person
to
serve
a
nabob
as
could
well
be
imagined
but
the
girl
knew
thomas
good
points
and
remembering
them
took
courage
if
the
worst
comes
she
said
brightly
you
are
both
to
come
to
us
to
live
i
arranged
all
that
with
grandmother
you
know
but
i
not
much
afraid
of
your
being
obliged
to
leave
here
from
all
accounts
this
merrick
is
a
generous
and
man
and
i
discovered
that
strangers
are
not
likely
to
be
fearsome
when
you
come
to
know
them
the
unknown
always
makes
us
childishly
nervous
you
see
and
then
we
forget
it
wrong
to
borrow
trouble
true
gospil
said
old
hucks
to
know
my
nora
is
to
love
her
loves
nora
an
the
good
lord
he
care
o
us
so
long
it
seems
like
a
sort
o
sacrelidge
to
feel
that
all
thet
pretty
in
the
barn
spells
to
us
eh
ethel
mcnutt
arrived
just
then
with
big
ned
long
lon
taft
the
carpenter
and
widow
clark
that
lady
having
agreed
to
help
with
the
cleanin
she
did
usually
work
out
but
was
impelled
to
this
task
as
much
through
curiosity
to
see
the
new
furniture
as
from
desire
to
secure
the
wages
at
once
the
crowd
invaded
the
living
room
and
after
a
glance
around
ethel
ordered
every
bit
of
the
furniture
with
the
exception
of
two
antique
but
comfortable
sofas
carried
away
to
the
barn
and
stored
in
the
loft
it
did
not
take
long
to
clear
the
big
room
and
then
the
widow
clark
swept
out
and
began
to
scrub
the
floor
and
woodwork
while
took
her
men
into
the
right
wing
and
made
another
clearing
of
its
traps
this
room
interested
the
girl
very
much
in
it
joe
was
born
and
frail
wegg
and
her
silent
husband
had
both
passed
away
it
had
two
broad
french
windows
with
sash
doors
opening
on
to
a
little
porch
of
its
own
which
was
covered
thickly
with
honeysuckle
vines
a
cupboard
was
built
into
a
niche
of
the
thick
wall
but
it
was
locked
and
the
key
was
missing
upstairs
the
girl
had
the
rubbish
removed
for
the
first
time
in
a
generation
the
corded
bedstead
in
the
north
room
was
sent
to
join
its
fellows
in
the
barn
loft
and
ned
long
swept
everything
clean
in
readiness
for
the
scrubbers
then
while
widow
clark
and
nora
cleaned
industriously
for
the
blind
woman
insisted
on
helping
and
did
almost
as
much
work
as
her
companion
the
men
folks
proceeded
to
the
barn
and
under
the
directions
uncrated
the
new
furniture
and
opened
the
bales
of
rugs
and
matting
lon
taft
was
building
new
steps
to
the
front
porch
but
old
hucks
and
ned
and
mcnutt
reverently
unpacked
the
truck
and
set
each
piece
carefully
aside
how
they
marveled
at
the
enameled
beds
and
colored
wicker
furniture
the
easy
chairs
for
lounging
the
dainty
dressers
and
all
the
innumerable
pretty
things
discovered
in
boxes
bales
and
barrels
you
may
well
imagine
even
ethel
was
amazed
and
delighted
at
the
thoughtfulness
of
the
dealer
in
including
everything
that
might
be
useful
or
ornamental
in
a
summer
home
the
next
few
days
were
indeed
busy
ones
for
the
girl
entered
enthusiastically
upon
her
task
to
transform
the
old
house
and
with
the
material
john
merrick
had
so
amply
provided
she
succeeded
admirably
the
little
maid
was
country
bred
but
having
seen
glimpses
of
city
life
and
possessing
much
native
good
taste
she
arranged
the
rooms
so
charmingly
that
they
would
admit
of
scant
improvement
the
big
living
room
must
serve
as
a
dining
room
as
well
as
parlor
but
so
spacious
was
it
that
such
an
arrangement
proved
easy
no
especial
furniture
for
the
living
room
had
been
provided
but
by
stealing
a
few
chairs
and
odd
pieces
from
the
ample
supply
provided
for
the
bedrooms
adding
the
two
quaint
sofas
and
the
upright
piano
and
spreading
the
rugs
in
an
artistic
fashion
ethel
managed
to
make
the
parlor
part
of
the
room
appear
very
cosy
the
dining
corner
had
a
round
table
and
chairs
finished
in
weathered
oak
and
when
all
was
in
order
the
effect
was
not
inharmonious
some
inspiration
had
induced
merrick
to
send
down
a
batch
of
eighteen
framed
pictures
procured
at
a
bargain
but
from
a
reliable
dealer
he
thought
they
might
help
out
and
ethel
knew
they
would
for
the
walls
of
the
old
house
were
quite
bare
of
ornament
she
made
them
go
as
far
as
possible
and
old
hucks
by
this
time
thoroughly
bewildered
hung
them
where
she
dictated
and
made
laughable
attempts
to
describe
the
subjects
to
blind
nora
a
telegram
telephoned
over
from
the
junction
announced
the
proposed
arrival
of
the
party
on
thursday
morning
and
the
was
sure
that
everything
would
be
in
readiness
at
that
time
the
paint
on
lon
repairs
would
be
dry
the
grass
in
the
front
yard
was
closely
cropped
and
the
little
bed
of
flowers
between
the
and
the
was
blooming
finely
the
cow
was
in
the
stable
the
pigs
in
the
shed
and
the
plymouth
rocks
strutted
over
the
yard
with
an
absurd
assumption
of
pride
wednesday
ethel
took
old
hucks
over
to
millville
and
bought
for
him
from
sam
cotting
a
new
suit
of
dark
gray
store
clothes
together
with
shirts
shoes
and
underwear
she
made
mcnutt
pay
the
bill
with
john
merrick
money
agreeing
to
explain
the
case
to
the
nabob
herself
and
back
up
the
agent
in
the
unauthorized
expenditure
nora
had
a
new
gingham
dress
too
which
the
girl
had
herself
provided
and
on
thursday
morning
ethel
was
at
the
wegg
farm
bright
and
early
to
see
the
old
couple
properly
attired
to
receive
their
new
master
she
also
put
a
last
touch
to
the
pretty
furniture
and
placed
vases
of
her
own
roses
and
sweet
peas
here
and
there
to
render
the
place
homelike
and
to
welcome
the
expected
arrivals
if
they
do
like
it
said
the
girl
smiling
they
rather
hard
to
please
they
sure
to
like
it
dear
answered
old
nora
touching
with
sensitive
fingers
the
flowers
the
books
and
the
opened
piano
if
they
do
they
heretics
an
sinners
an
there
no
good
in
whatever
then
the
little
bade
to
hucks
and
his
wife
told
them
to
keep
brave
hearts
and
rode
her
pony
to
thompson
crossing
chapter
the
arrival
of
the
nabobs
well
said
uncle
john
looking
out
of
the
car
window
we
nearly
there
he
did
look
the
millionaire
or
nabob
or
anything
else
but
a
modest
little
man
full
of
joy
at
getting
into
the
country
his
clothing
was
not
distinctive
of
wealth
his
hands
were
hard
and
roughened
by
years
of
toil
and
his
necktie
had
a
plebeian
trick
of
sliding
under
his
left
ear
uncle
john
was
just
a
plain
simple
fellow
before
he
acquired
riches
and
the
possession
of
millions
had
in
no
way
altered
his
nature
the
three
nieces
and
himself
were
the
only
passengers
in
the
coach
aside
from
mary
patricia
cook
finding
that
the
road
did
not
run
a
sleeper
to
chazy
junction
merrick
had
ordered
one
attached
to
the
train
for
his
especial
use
but
he
did
not
allow
even
patsy
to
suspect
this
extravagance
it
seems
to
me
observed
beth
as
she
peered
out
while
the
train
puffed
up
the
steep
grade
as
if
we
arrived
at
the
heart
of
a
wilderness
where
farms
are
likely
to
be
as
scarce
as
egyptian
temples
the
truth
is
replied
her
uncle
with
a
cheerful
smile
that
none
of
us
has
an
idea
where
we
going
or
what
that
farm
of
mine
looks
like
we
explorers
like
stanley
in
that
the
beauty
of
this
excursion
i
glad
i
did
bring
any
party
dresses
said
dainty
louise
shaking
her
blonde
head
with
a
doubting
expression
toward
the
rock
covered
hills
why
you
might
need
them
for
remarked
patsy
with
a
laugh
that
is
if
any
hay
grows
in
this
land
of
quarries
the
train
stopped
with
a
jerk
started
with
another
jerk
and
stopped
again
with
a
third
that
made
them
catch
their
breaths
and
hold
fast
to
the
seats
chazy
junction
seh
said
the
colored
porter
entering
in
haste
to
seize
their
bags
they
alighted
on
a
small
wooden
platform
and
their
hand
baggage
was
deposited
beside
them
their
trunks
were
being
tumbled
off
a
car
far
ahead
then
the
whistle
screamed
the
train
gave
a
jerk
and
proceeded
on
its
way
and
uncle
john
his
nieces
and
their
maid
found
themselves
confronting
a
solitary
man
in
shirtsleeves
who
yawned
languidly
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stared
at
the
strangers
unmoved
it
was
six
the
july
sun
was
set
in
a
clear
sky
but
the
air
was
cool
and
pleasant
uncle
john
glanced
around
with
the
eye
of
a
practiced
traveler
back
of
the
station
was
a
huddle
of
frame
buildings
set
in
a
hollow
the
was
the
only
person
in
sight
is
there
a
carriage
to
meet
us
asked
louise
in
a
slightly
frigid
tone
seems
not
replied
her
uncle
then
he
addressed
the
native
can
you
tell
us
sir
where
millville
is
he
asked
mile
up
the
road
thank
you
kindly
is
there
any
carriage
to
be
had
the
man
smiled
sardonically
kerridges
he
said
do
grow
in
these
parts
i
take
it
you
be
the
party
fer
the
wegg
farm
you

said
merrick
i
glad
we
are
getting
acquainted
folks
all
well
pretty
fair
now
sir
we
want
some
breakfast
to
begin
with
and
then
some
way
to
get
to
my
farm
peggy
orter
looked
after
you
remarked
the
man
eyeing
the
dainty
gowns
of
the
young
ladies
reflectively
who
peggy
that
mcnutt
the
man
you
hired
to
do
things
ah
yes
he
surely
ought
to
have
sent
some
sort
of
a
team
to
meet
us
agreed
uncle
john
what
that
group
of
houses
yonder
thet
the
junction
any
hotel
sure
and
a
livery
stable
there
is
then
we
get
along
said
uncle
john
assuming
a
sudden
brisk
manner
just
keep
your
eye
on
our
baggage
till
we
get
back
my
good
fellow
there
are
no
people
to
interfere
with
it
but
some
bears
or
tigers
might
come
out
of
the
hills
and
eat
it
up
now
girls
away
we
go
uncle
john
nieces
were
not
so
greatly
dismayed
at
this
experience
as
might
have
been
expected
they
had
recently
accompanied
their
erratic
relative
on
a
european
trip
and
had
learned
to
be
patient
under
difficulties
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
dusty
road
they
came
to
the
hotel
a
dismal
unclean
looking
place
that
smelled
of
stale
beer
uncle
john
routed
out
the
proprietor
folks
up
he
inquired
long
ago
said
the
man
get
us
some
boiled
eggs
bread
and
butter
and
plenty
of
fresh
milk
right
away
ordered
merrick
the
quicker
it
comes
the
more
i
pay
you
bring
a
table
out
here
on
the
porch
and
we
eat
in
the
open
air
where
the
livery
stable
eh
oh
i
see
now
step
lively
my
man
and
your
fortune
made
i
add
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
for
every
five
minutes
you
save
us
in
time
the
fellow
stared
then
woke
up
with
a
start
and
disappeared
within
by
gum
i
bet
a
hen
it
thet
air
nabob
he
muttered
leaving
his
girls
and
mary
to
sit
on
the
wooden
benches
of
the
porch
uncle
john
crossed
the
road
to
the
livery
stable
where
he
discovered
a
man
and
a
boy
engaged
in
cleaning
the
half
dozen
sorry
looking
nags
the
establishment
contained
a
democrat
wagon
was
engaged
to
carry
the
party
to
the
wegg
farm
at
millville
and
a
rickety
lumber
wagon
would
take
the
baggage
the
liveryman
recognized
his
customer
as
soon
as
the
wegg
farm
was
mentioned
and
determined
to
do
the
city
guy
up
brown
road
bad
an
up
hill
an
my
time
vallyble
he
said
in
a
surly
voice
i
hev
to
charge
ye
three
dollars
for
what
asked
uncle
john
quietly
fer
the
two
teams
to
millville
get
them
harnessed
right
away
load
up
the
baggage
and
have
the
democrat
at
the
hotel
in
twenty
minutes
here
five
dollars
and
if
you
look
pleasant
you
may
keep
the
change
blame
my
thick
skull
muttered
the
as
he
watched
the
little
man
depart
what
a
cussed
fool
i
were
not
to
say
four
dollars
instead
o
three
but
he
called
to
his
boy
to
hurry
up
and
in
the
stipulated
time
the
teams
were
ready
uncle
john
and
his
nieces
were
just
finishing
their
eggs
which
were
fresh
and
delicious
the
milk
was
also
a
revelation
through
the
windows
of
the
hotel
several
frowsy
looking
women
and
an
open
mouthed
boy
were
staring
hard
at
the
unconscious
city
folk
even
louise
was
in
a
mood
for
laughter
as
they
mounted
to
the
high
seats
of
the
democrat
the
glorious
air
the
clear
sunshine
and
a
satisfactory
if
simple
breakfast
had
put
them
all
in
a
good
humor
with
the
world
they
stopped
at
the
station
for
their
hand
baggage
and
saw
that
the
trunks
were
properly
loaded
on
the
lumber
wagon
then
slowly
they
started
to
mount
the
long
hill
that
began
its
incline
just
across
the
tracks
sure
this
is
the
way
inquired
uncle
john
perched
beside
the
driver
i
were
horned
here
answered
the
man
conclusively
that
seems
to
settle
it
pretty
big
hill
that
one
ahead
of
us
it
the
little
bill
when
we
cross
it
we
at
millville
seven
miles
of
desolate
country
could
not
dampen
the
spirits
of
the
girls
secretly
each
one
was
confident
that
uncle
john
unknown
farm
would
prove
to
be
impossible
and
that
in
a
day
or
so
at
the
latest
they
would
retrace
their
steps
but
in
the
meantime
the
adventure
was
novel
and
interesting
and
they
were
prepared
to
accept
the
inevitable
with
all
graciousness
when
after
the
long
climb
up
the
hill
they
saw
the
quaint
mill
and
the
town
lying
just
across
rushing
little
bill
creek
when
from
their
elevation
they
beheld
the
placid
lake
half
hidden
by
its
stately
pines
and
gazed
up
the
rugged
and
picturesque
to
the
great
mountains
beyond
then
indeed
they
drew
in
deep
breaths
and
began
as
patsy
exclaimed
to
be
glad
they
came
that
millville
asked
uncle
john
eagerly
yes
sir
and
which
of
those
houses
belongs
to
the
wegg
farm
ye
ca
see
the
wegg
house
from
here
the
pines
hide
it
said
the
man
urging
his
horses
into
a
trot
as
they
approached
the
bridge
pretty
good
farm
inquired
uncle
john
hopefully
worst
in
the
county
was
the
disconcerting
reply
half
rocks
an
half
trees
ol
wegg
was
no
farmer
he
were
a
so
it
no
wonder
he
got
took
in
when
he
bought
the
place
uncle
john
sighed
i
just
bought
it
myself
he
observed
there
a
ol
addige
said
the
man
grinning
a
fool
an
his
money
the
house
is
a
hunker
but
the
use
of
a
house
without
a
farm
what
is
a
please
inquired
louise
curiously
the
liveryman
ventured
no
reply
perhaps
because
he
was
guiding
his
horses
over
the
rickety
bridge
want
to
stop
at
the
village
he
asked
no
drive
on
to
the
farm
the
scene
was
so
rude
and
at
the
same
time
so
picturesque
that
it
impressed
them
all
very
agreeably
perhaps
they
were
the
more
delighted
because
they
had
expected
nothing
admirable
in
this
all
but
forsaken
spot
they
did
not
notice
the
people
who
stared
after
them
as
they
rattled
through
the
village
or
they
would
have
seen
uncle
agent
in
front
of
his
office
his
round
eyes
fairly
bulging
from
his
head
it
had
never
occurred
to
mcnutt
to
be
at
the
junction
to
welcome
his
patron
he
had
followed
his
instructions
and
set
merrick
house
in
order
and
there
he
considered
that
his
duty
ended
he
would
of
course
call
on
the
nabob
presently
and
render
an
account
of
the
money
he
had
received
sam
cotting
the
gazed
after
the
livery
team
with
a
sour
countenance
he
resented
the
fact
that
five
of
groceries
had
been
forwarded
from
the
city
to
the
wegg
farm
thunder
the
use
havin
city
folks
here
ef
they
do
buy
nothin
he
asked
the
boys
and
they
agreed
it
was
no
use
at
all
proceeding
at
a
smart
trot
the
horses
came
to
the
pearson
farm
where
they
turned
into
the
jane
at
the
left
and
straightway
subsided
to
a
slow
walk
the
wheels
bumping
and
jolting
over
the
stony
way
what
this
exclaimed
uncle
john
who
had
narrowly
escaped
biting
his
tongue
through
and
through
why
did
you
turn
down
here
it
the
road
returned
the
driver
with
a
chuckle
it
the
lane
to
yer
farm
an
the
farm
the
same
sort
land
as
the
lane
for
a
few
moments
the
passengers
maintained
a
dismal
silence
the
country
lovely
said
patsy
glancing
at
the
panorama
as
they
mounted
a
slight
elevation
are
you
sure
uncle
that
there
is
a
house
or
any
place
of
refuge
on
your
farm
asked
louise
in
a
mischievous
tone
why
there
a
rumor
of
a
house
and
the
rumor
says
it
a
hunker
replied
merrick
in
a
voice
that
betrayed
a
slight
uneasiness
doubtless
the
house
matches
the
farm
said
beth
calmly
i
imagine
it
has
two
rooms
and
a
leaky
roof
but
never
mind
girls
this
has
been
a
pleasant
trip
and
we
can
seek
shelter
elsewhere
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
guess
the
worst
has
come
observed
the
driver
for
the
house
is
by
odds
the
best
part
o
the
wegg
farm
it
big
enough
fer
a
hotel
an
cost
a
lot
o
money
in
its
day
seems
like
the
lunatics
all
crowd
to
thet
place
fust
ol
wegg
wasted
of
his
substance
on
it
an
now
he
paused
perhaps
fearing
he
might
become
personal
in
his
remarks
and
uncle
john
coughed
while
the
girls
shrieked
with
laughter
expecting
nothing
they
were
amazed
when
they
passed
the
orchard
and
the
group
of
pines
that
had
concealed
the
house
and
suddenly
drew
up
beside
the
stile
built
into
the
rail
fence
every
eye
was
instantly
upon
the
quaint
roomy
mansion
the
grassy
sward
extending
between
it
and
the
road
and
the
cosy
and
setting
of
the
outbuildings
here
wegg
said
the
liveryman
oh
uncle
cried
beth
how
lovely
louise
pretty
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
patsy
drew
in
a
long
breath
and
scrambled
out
of
the
high
seat
on
the
corner
of
the
front
porch
stood
nora
arrayed
in
her
neat
gray
gown
and
a
cap
her
face
was
composed
but
she
felt
herself
trembling
a
little
old
hucks
came
slowly
down
the
steps
to
greet
the
company
never
in
his
memory
had
his
dress
been
so
immaculate
the
queer
old
fellow
seemed
to
appreciate
this
as
he
raised
his
smiling
face
from
the
stooped
shoulders
and
poised
it
on
one
side
like
a
sparrow
welcome
home
sir
he
said
to
uncle
john
i
hucks
sir
thomas
hucks
and
without
more
words
he
proceeded
to
remove
the
satchels
from
the
wagon
ah

and
the
smile
of
the
old

but
i
glad

that

my
wife
nora
on

porch

the
housekeeper
sir
and
then
lowering
his
voice
so
that
only
the
girls
and
uncle
john
could
hear
he
added
simply
she
blind
patsy
walked
straight
up
to
the
eager
pathetic
figure
of
the
woman
and
took
her
hand
in
a
warm
clasp
i
patricia
nora
she
said

the
old
woman
beaming
delightedly
at
these
evidences
of
kindliness
here

another
nora
said
their
cousin
in
gentle
tones
i

young

now
uncle
they
all
protested
in
nearly
identical
words
and
louise
added
let
us
drink
in
the
delights
of
this
pretty
picture
before
we
shut
ourselves
up
in
the
stuffy
rooms
i
hope
been
aired
patsy
ran
to
a
on
the
side
lawn
where
a
fussy
hen
was
calling
to
her
children
that
strangers
had
arrived
beth
exclaimed
at
the
honeysuckle
vines
and
louise
sank
into
a
rustic
chair
with
a
sigh
of
content
i
so
glad
you
brought
us
here
uncle
she
said
what
a
surprise
it
is
to
find
the
place
so
pretty
they
could
hear
the
rush
of
the
little
bill
in
the
wood
behind
them
and
a
soft
breeze
stirred
the
pines
and
wafted
their
fragrance
to
the
nostrils
of
the
new
arrivals
uncle
john
squatted
on
the
shady
steps
and
fairly
beamed
upon
the
rustic
scene
spread
out
before
him
patsy
had
now
thrown
aside
her
hat
and
jacket
and
lay
outstretched
upon
the
cool
grass
while
the
chickens
eyed
her
with
evident
suspicion
beth
was
picking
a
bouquet
of
honeysuckles
just
because
they
were
so
sweet
and
homely
i
almost
sure
i
sent
some
hammocks
and
a
croquet
set
remarked
uncle
john
they
here
sir
said
old
hucks
who
had
watched
each
one
with
his
persistent
smile
and
now
stood
awaiting
his
new
master
commands
but
we
did
know
jest
where
ye
wanted
put
mary
came
out
she
had
taken
off
her
things
and
donned
her
white
apron
the
house
is
quite
wonderful
merrick
she
said
there
is
everything
we
can
possibly
need
and
all
as
neat
as
wax
the
report
stirred
the
girls
to
explore
they
all
trooped
into
the
big
living
room
and
were
at
once
captivated
by
its
charm
nora
led
them
upstairs
to
their
chambers
finding
the
way
as
unerringly
as
if
she
possessed
perfect
vision
and
here
a
new
chorus
of
delight
was
evoked
the
blue
room
is
mine
cried
louise
mine
is
the
pink
room
said
beth
and
i
choose
the
white
room
declared
patsy
the
major
is
just
next
and
it
will
please
him
because
it
is
all
green
and
gold
but
where
will
uncle
john
room
the
master
will
use
the
right
wing
said
old
nora
who
had
listened
with
real
pleasure
to
the
exclamations
of
delight
it
were
room
ye
know
an
we
fitted
it
all
new
indeed
uncle
john
was
at
that
moment
inspecting
his
apartment
and
he
sighed
contentedly
as
he
congratulated
himself
upon
his
foresight
in
sending
down
the
furnishings
on
the
chance
of
their
being
needed
they
had
effected
a
complete
transformation
of
the
old
house
but
who
had
arranged
everything
surely
the
perfect
taste
and
dainty
touch
evidenced
everywhere
was
not
to
be
attributed
to
blind
nora
the
little
man
was
thoughtful
as
he
turned
to
old
hucks
who
did
it
thomas
he
asked
miss
ethel

john
nodded

call

remarked
we

her
a
good
deal

imagine
and
she

grateful
thanks
chapter
vi
peggy
presents
his
bill
millville
waited
in
agonized
suspense
for
three
days
for
tangible
evidence
that
the
nabob
was
in
their
midst
as
nib
corkins
poetically
expressed
it
but
the
city
folks
seemed
glued
to
the
farm
and
no
one
of
them
had
yet
appeared
in
the
village
as
a
matter
of
fact
patsy
and
uncle
john
were
enthusiastically
fishing
in
the
little
bill
far
up
in
the
pine
woods
and
having
the
time
of
their
lives
in
spite
of
their
scant
success
in
capturing
trout
old
hucks
could
go
out
before
breakfast
and
bring
in
an
ample
supply
of
speckled
beauties
for
mary
to
fry
but
uncle
john
splendid
outfit
seemed
scorned
by
the
finny
folk
and
after
getting
her
dress
torn
in
sundry
places
and
a
hook
in
the
fleshy
part
of
her
arm
patsy
learned
to
seek
shelter
behind
a
tree
whenever
her
uncle
cast
his
fly
but
they
reveled
in
the
woods
and
would
lie
on
the
bank
for
hours
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
brook
and
the
songs
of
the
birds
the
temper
of
the
other
two
girls
was
different
beth
de
graf
had
brought
along
an
archery
outfit
and
she
set
up
her
target
on
the
ample
green
the
day
following
her
arrival
here
she
practiced
persistently
shooting
at
sixty
yards
with
much
skill
but
occasionally
when
louise
tired
of
her
novel
and
her
cushions
in
the
hammock
the
two
girls
would
play
tennis
or
croquet
together
beth
invariably
winning
such
delightful
laziness
could
brook
no
interference
for
the
first
days
of
their
arrival
and
it
was
not
until
peggy
mcnutt
ventured
over
on
monday
morning
for
a
settlement
with
merrick
that
any
from
the
little
world
around
them
dared
intrude
upon
the
dwellers
at
the
wegg
farm
although
the
agent
had
been
late
in
starting
from
millville
and
nick
thorne
sorrel
mare
had
walked
every
step
of
the
way
peggy
was
obliged
to
wait
in
the
yard
a
good
half
hour
for
the
nabob
to
finish
his
breakfast
during
that
time
he
tried
to
decide
which
of
the
two
statements
of
accounts
that
he
had
prepared
he
was
most
justified
in
presenting
he
had
learned
from
the
liveryman
at
the
junction
that
merrick
had
paid
five
dollars
for
a
trip
that
was
usually
made
for
two
and
also
that
the
extravagant
man
had
paid
cents
more
to
lucky
todd
the
hotel
keeper
than
his
bill
came
to
the
knowledge
of
such
reckless
expenditures
had
fortified
little
mcnutt
in
marking
up
the
account
of
the
money
he
had
received
and
instead
of
charging
two
dollars
a
day
for
his
own
services
as
he
had
at
first
intended
he
put
them
down
at
three
dollars
a
day
and
made
the
days
stretch
as
much
as
possible
also
he
charged
a
round
commission
on
the
wages
of
lon
taft
and
ned
long
and
doubled
the
liveryman
bill
for
hauling
the
goods
over
from
the
junction
ethel
thompson
had
refused
to
accept
any
payment
for
what
she
had
done
but
peggy
bravely
charged
it
up
at
good
round
figures
when
the
bill
was
made
out
and
figured
up
it
left
him
a
magnificent
surplus
for
his
private
account
but
at
the
last
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
made
out
another
bill
more
modest
in
its
extortions
he
had
brought
them
both
along
though
one
in
each
pocket
vacillating
between
them
as
he
thought
first
of
the
merrick
millions
and
then
of
the
righteous
anger
he
might
incur
by
the
time
uncle
john
came
out
to
him
smiling
and
cordial
he
had
not
thoroughly
made
up
his
mind
which
account
to
present
i
must
thank
you
for
carrying
out
my
orders
so
intelligently
began
the
millionaire
without
your
assistance
i
might
have
found
things
in
bad
shape
i
fear
mcnutt
was
reassured
the
nabob
would
stand
for
bill
no
without
a
doubt
i
tried
fer
to
do
my
best
sir
he
said
and
you
did
very
well
was
the
reply
i
hope
you
kept
your
expenditures
well
within
bounds
the
agent
heart
sank
at
the
question
and
the
shrewd
alert
look
that
accompanied
it
even
millionaires
do
not
allow
themselves
to
be
swindled
if
they
can
help
it
bill
no
would
be
stiff
enough
he
might
even
have
to
knock
a
few
dollars
off
from
that
most
things
is
high
in
millville
he
faltered
an
wages
has
gone
up
jest
the
boys
do
seem
to
wanter
do
nuthin
without
big
pay
that
is
the
case
everywhere
responded
merrick
thoughtfully
and
between
us
mcnutt
i
glad
wages
are
better
in
these
prosperous
times
the
man
who
works
by
the
day
should
be
well
paid
for
he
has
to
pay
well
for
his
living
adequately
paid
labor
is
the
foundation
of
all
prosperity
peggy
smiled
cheerfully
he
was
glad
he
had
had
the
forethought
to
bring
bill
no
along
with
him
hosses
is
high
too
he
remarked
complacently
an
lumber
an
nails
is
up
as
fer
the
i
bought
fer
ye
i
found
i
had
to
pay
like
sixty
for
it
i
suppose
they
overcharged
you
because
a
city
man
wanted
the
animals
but
of
course
you
would
not
allow
me
to
be
robbed
oh
not
mr
merrick
and
that
nag
in
the
stable
is
a
sorry
old
beast
peggy
was
in
despair
why
in
the
world
had
he
charged
for
the
beast
as
it
was
now
too
late
to
add
it
to
the
bill
he
replied
grudgingly
the
hoss
you
mention
belongs
to
the
place
sir
it
went
with
the
farm
o
old
hucks
an
nora
i
glad
you
reminded
me
of
those
people
said
uncle
john
seriously
tell
me
their
history
louise
sauntered
from
the
house
at
this
juncture
and
sank
gracefully
upon
the
grass
at
her
uncle
feet
she
carried
a
book
but
did
not
open
it
ai
much
to
tell
sir

the
agent

farm
an
had
this
house
built
on
it
a
proceedin
that
ef
i
do
say
it
struck
as
it
curious
agreed
merrick
but
the
thing
was
thet
he
did
make
no
at
farmin
folks
said
he
had
money
to
burn
fer
he
loaded
it
into
this
fool

glad
to
leave
him
alone
an
the
friend
he
ever
had
were
crazy
will
thompson
crazy
as
a
loon
the
agent
hitched
uneasily
on
the
lawn
bench
where
he
was
seated
and
then
continued
hastily
but
thet
ai
neither
here
ner
there
a
baby
was
born
arter
a
time
an
while
he
was
young
the
mother

were
the
suddint
death
ner
where
he
went
to
uncle
john
seemed
thoughtful
but
asked
no
more
questions
and
mcnutt
appeared
to
be
relieved
that
he
refrained
but
the
bill
ought
to
be
forthcoming
now
and
the
agent
gave
a
guilty
start
as
his
patron
remarked
i
want
to
settle
with
you
for
what
you
have
done
i
willing
to
pay
a
liberal
price
you
understand
but
i
wo
submit
to
being
robbed
outrageously
by
you
or
any
of
your
millville
people
this
was
said
so
sternly
that
it
sent
mcnutt
into
an
ague
of
terror
he
fumbled
for
the
smallest
bill
tremblingly
placed
it
in
hand
and
then
with
a
thrill
of
despair
realized
he
had
presented
the
dreadful
no
it
it
a
of
what
i
spent
out
he
stammered
uncle
john
ran
his
eye
over
the
bill
what
are
plymouth
rocks
he
demanded
he
hens
sir
hens
at
a
dollar
apiece
thoroughbreds
sir
extry
fine
stock
i
raised
myself
you
charged
them
twice
eh
here
an
item

rocks
twelve
dollars
and
farther
down
plymouth
rocks
eighteen
dollars
oh
yes
o
course
ye
see
i
sold
you
a
dozen
first
of
the
dollar
kind
then
i
thought
as
how
bein
fine
young
birds
you
be
tempted
fer
to
eat
an
a
dozen
do
go
fur
on
the
table
so
i
up
an
sold
ye
another
dozen
extry
ol
stock
an
remarkable
fer
a
each
which
is
dirt
cheap
because
they
too
old
to
eat
an
jest
right
fer
layers
are
they
here
every
one
of
very
good
i
glad
to
have
them
the
cow
seems
reasonably
priced
for
a
jersey
it
is
jest
exclaimed
peggy
reassured
and
your
people
have
all
done
work
of
an
unusual
character
in
a
painstaking
manner
i
am
very
much
pleased
there
seems
to
be
a
hundred
and
forty
dollars
my
due
remaining
from
the
five
hundred
i
sent
you
here
it
is
sir
responded
mcnutt
taking
the
money
from
his
in
another
place
he
had
more
money
which
he
had
intended
to
pay
if
the
smaller
bill
had
been
presented
uncle
john
took
the
money
you
are
an
honest
fellow
mcnutt
said
he
i
had
expected
a
dollar
back
for
folks
usually
take
advantage
of
a
stranger
if
he
gives
them
half
a
chance
so
i
thank
you
for
your
honesty
as
well
as
for
your
services
good
morning
the
agent
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
to
be
sech
a
duffer
as
to
return
that
money
when
by
means
of
a
little
strategy
he
might
have
kept
it
made
him
feel
both
humiliated
and
indignant
a
hundred
and
forty
dollars
when
would
he
have
a
chance
to
get
such
a
windfall
again
pah
he
was
a
fool
to
copy
his
identical
thoughts
a
gol
dum
blithering
idjit
all
the
way
home
he
reflected
dismally
upon
his
lack
of
business
foresight
and
strove
to
plan
ways
to
get
money
thet
easy
mark
did
the
man
rob
you
uncle
asked
louise
when
the
agent
had
disappeared
yes
dear
but
i
would
give
him
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
i
realized
it
that
was
what
i
thought
by
the
way
that
wegg
history
seems
both
romantic
and
unusual
she
said
musingly
do
you
scent
some
mystery
in
what
the
man
said
of
it
mystery
cried
uncle
john
lordy
no
louise
you
been
readin
too
many
novels
romances
do
grow
in
parts
like
these
but
i
think
this
is
where
they
are
most
likely
to
grow
uncle
persisted
the
girl
just
consider
a
retired
sea
captain
hides
inland
with
no
companions
but
a
grinning
sailor
and
his
blind
housekeeper
except
his
pale
wife
of
course
and
she
is
described
as
sad
and
unhappy
who
was
she
do
you
think
i
do
think
said
uncle
john
smiling
and
patting
the
fair
check
of
his
niece
and
it
do
matter
who
she
was
i
sure
it
does
it
is
the
key
to
the
whole
mystery
even
her
baby
could
not

and
that
finished

romance
louise
oh
no
that
added
to
its
interest
the

grew
up
in

place
and
brooded
on
his

joe

away
from

to
get
busy
in
the
world
major
doyle
helped
him
with
my

for

was
sensible
to

uncle
john
arose
and
sauntered
around
to
the
barn
to
look
at
the
litter
of
new
pigs
that
just
then
served
to
interest
and
amuse
him
the

remained
seated
upon

chapter
vii
louise
scents
a
mystery
louise
merrick
was
the
eldest
of
uncle
john
nieces
having
just
passed
her
eighteenth
birthday
in
the
city
she
was
devoted
to
the
requirements
of
fashionable
society
and
urged
thereto
by
her
mother
led
a
mere
butterfly
existence
her
two
cousins
frankly
agreed
that
louise
was
shallow
insincere
and
inclined
to
be
affected
but
of
the
three
girls
she
displayed
the
most
equable
and
pleasant
disposition
and
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
was
composed
and
charming
in
manner
for
this
reason
she
was
an
agreeable
companion
and
men
usually
admired
her
graceful
figure
and
her
piquant
pretty
face
with
its
crown
of
fluffy
blonde
hair
and
winning
expression
there
was
a
rumor
that
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
arthur
weldon
a
young
man
of
position
in
the
city
but
uncle
john
ignored
the
possibility
of
losing
one
of
his
cherished
nieces
and
declared
that
louise
was
still
too
young
to
think
of
marriage
when
away
from
her
frivolous
mother
and
the
inconsequent
home
environments
the
girl
was
more
unaffected
and
natural
in
her
ways
and
her
faults
were
doubtless
more
the
result
of
education
than
of
natural
tendency
one
thing
was
indisputable
however
louise
merrick
was
a
clever
girl
possessing
a
quick
intellect
and
a
keen
insight
into
the
character
of
others
her
apparent
shallowness
was
a
blind
of
the
same
character
as
her
assumed
graciousness
and
while
she
would
have
been
more
lovable
without
any
pretence
or
sham
she
could
not
have
been
louise
merrick
and
allow
others
to
read
her
as
she
actually
was
patsy
and
beth
thought
they
knew
her
and
admired
or
liked
rather
than
loved
their
cousin
uncle
john
thought
he
knew
her
too
and
was
very
proud
of
his
eldest
niece
in
spite
of
some
discovered
qualities
that
were
not
wholly
admirable
an
extensive
course
of
light
literature
not
void
of
detective
stories
had
at
this
moment
primed
louise
with
its
influence
to
the
extent
of
inducing
her
to
scent
a
mystery
in
the
history
of
captain
wegg
the
plain
folks
around
millville
might
speculate
listlessly
upon
the
queer
doin
at
the
farm
and
never
get
anywhere
near
the
truth
indeed
the
strange
occurrences
she
had
just
heard
were
nearly
forgotten
in
the
community
and
soon
would
be
forgotten
altogether
unless
the
quick
ear
of
a
young
girl
had
caught
the
clue
so
long
ignored
at
first
she
scarcely
appreciated
the
importance
of
the
undertaking
it
occurred
to
her
that
an
effort
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
captain
romance
would
be
a
charming
diversion
while
she
resided
at
millville
and
in
undertaking
the
task
she
laughingly
accused
herself
of
becoming
an
amateur
detective
an
occupation
that
promised
to
be
thrilling
and
delightful
warned
however
by
the
rebuff
she
had
met
with
from
uncle
john
the
girl
decided
not
to
confide
either
her
suspicions
or
her
proposed
investigation
to
anyone
for
the
present
but
to
keep
her
own
counsel
until
she
could
surprise
them
all
with
the
denouement
or
required
assistance
to
complete
her
work
inspired
by
the
cleverness
and
fascination
of
this
idea
louise
set
to
work
to
tabulate
the
information
she
had
received
thus
far
noting
the
element
of
mystery
each
fact
evolved
first
captain
wegg
must
have
been
a
rich
man
in
order
to
build
this
house
maintain
two
servants
and
live
for
years
in
comfort
without
any
income
from
his
barren
farm
lands
what
became
of
his
money
after
his
death
why
was
his
only
son
obliged
to
fly
to
the
cities
in
order
to
obtain
a
livelihood
secondly
the
captain
a
surly
and
silent
man
had
brought
hither
perhaps
by
force
a
young
woman
as
his
wife
who
was
so
unhappy
that
she
pined
away
and
died
who
was
this
woman
what
had
rendered
her
so
unhappy
and
despairing
thirdly
the
captain
only
friend
had
been
a
crazy
man
named
will
thompson
was
he
crazy
before
the
captain
death
or
had
he
become
crazed
at
that
time
some
terrible
tragedy
unhinging
his
mind
fourthly
the
granddaughter
of
thompson
ethel
and
the
son
of
captain
wegg
had
been
in
love
with
each
other
and
people
expected
they
would
marry
in
time
but
at
his
father
sudden
death
the
boy
fled
and
left
his
sweetheart
without
a
word
why
unless
something
had
occurred
that
rendered
their
marriage
impossible
in
the
fifth
place
there
was
old
hucks
and
his
blind
wife
to
be
considered
what
did
they
know
about
their
old
master
secret
history
what
tragic
memories
lurked
beneath
the
man
perpetual
smile
and
the
woman
composed
and
sightless
face
surely
there
was
enough
here
to
excite
the
curiosity
and
warrant
an
effort
to
untangle
the
mystery
and
as
instruments
to
the
end
there
were
several
people
available
who
could
be
of
use
to
her
mcnutt
the
agent
who
evidently
knew
more
than
he
had
cared
to
tell
old
hucks
and
his
wife
and
ethel
thompson
the
there
might
be
others
but
one
or
another
of
these
four
must
know
the
truth
and
it
would
be
her
pleasant
duty
to
obtain
a
full
disclosure
so
she
was
anxious
to
begin
her
investigations
at
once
when
her
uncle
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
pigs
louise
said
to
him
i
been
thinking
dear
that
we
ought
to
call
upon
that
young
lady
who
arranged
our
rooms
and
thank
her
for
her
kindness
that
true
he
replied
ca
we
drive
over
to
thompson
this
morning
uncle
beth
and
patsy
have
planned
a
tramp
to
the
lake
and
a
row
after
then
let
us
make
our
call
together
we
can
invite
the
girl
to
come
here
and
spend
a
day
with
us
when
patsy
and
beth
will
be
able
to
meet
her
that
a
good
idea
louise
i
was
wondering
what
i
do
this
morning
tell
old
hucks
to
get
the
nag
harnessed
the
girl
ran
eagerly
upon
her
errand
old
hucks
seemed
surprised
and
a
curious
expression
showed
for
an
instant
through
his
smile
but
he
turned
without
a
word
to
harness
the
horse
louise
stood
watching
him
your
fingers
are
quite
nimble
thomas
considering
the
fact
that
you
were
once
a
sailor
she
said
but
sailors
have
to
be
nimble
miss
he
returned
buckling
a
strap
unmoved
who
tol
ye
i
were
once
a
man
i
guessed
it
as
he
appeared
indisposed
to
say
more
on
the
subject
she
asked
did

captain
wegg
partly

time
then

him
dan
ai
vicious
he
jest
ornery
she
climbed
into
the
dilapidated
old
buggy
and
took
the
reins
dan
groaned
and
ambled
slowly
around
to
where
uncle
john
stood
awaiting
his
niece
let
me
drive
uncle
she
said
i
understand
dan
well

do
returned
uncle
john
in
his
whimsical
way
as
he
mounted
to
the
seat
beside
her
i
do
understand
how
he
happened
to
live
since
the
landing
of
columbus
or
what
he
good
for
or
why
someone
do
knock
him
on
the
head
dan
turned
his
long
lean
face
as
if
to
give
the
speaker
a
reproachful
look
then
he
groaned
again
leaned
forward
and
drew
the
buggy
slowly
into
the
stony
lane
do
you
know
where
the
thompsons
live
inquired
uncle
john
no

dan
that
was
the
best
thing
the
nag
did
he
knew
how
to
whoa
thomas
called
uncle
john
turning
in
his
seat
and
at
the
summons
old
hucks
came
from
the
barn
and
approached
them
how
do
you
get
to
miss
thompson
place
miss
ethel
another
fleeting
expression
of
surprise
yes

stammered
hucks
glancing
up
at
them
with
his
bright
elusive
smile
well

going

growled
merrick
then
turn
left
at
the
main
road

chapter
viii
the
little
dan
balked
only
twice
on
the
journey
but
even
this
moderate
rebellion
so
annoyed
uncle
john
that
he
declared
he
would
walk
back
rather
than
ride
behind
this
mulish
antiquity
again
when
they
came
to
the
thompson
dwelling
it
at
first
sight
seemed
deserted
a
knock
on
the
front
door
failed
to
produce
any
response
perhaps
they
away
from
home
suggested
louise
there
a
path
around
to
the
back
said
uncle
john
let
explore
in
that
direction
they
made
their
way
leisurely
toward
the
rear
and
had
almost
passed
the
house
when
a
deep
roar
broke
the
stillness
it
was
succeeded
by
another
and
another
like
the
bellowing
of
a
mad
bull
and
the
intruders
stopped
short
and
louise
clung
to
her
uncle
in
sudden
panic
be
still
will
stop
i
say
stop
a
sharp
crack
as
of
a
lash
accompanied
the
words
and
a
moan
or
two
was
followed
by
absolute
silence
uncle
john
and
louise
looked
at
one
another
with
startled
eyes
he
must
be
worse
said
the
old
gentleman
mopping
his
forehead
with
a
handkerchief
with
one
accord
they
started
softly
to
retrace
their
steps
when
a
new
sound
halted
them
again
it
was
a
clear
fresh
young
voice
singing
a
plaintive
ditty
in
a
nonchalant
careless
tone
that
ethel
i
sure
exclaimed
louise
grasping
her
uncle
arm
well
what
shall
we
do
he
demanded
the
crazy
man
seems
quiet
now
she
whispered
let
us
find
the
girl
if
we
can
so
again
they
traversed
the
path
and
this
time
came
to
the
pretty
garden
behind
the
house
ethel
was
tending
a
flower
bed
she
wore
her
gingham
dress
and
a
sunbonnet
and
kneeling
in
the
path
stretched
out
her
slim
brown
arm
to
uproot
the
weeds
but
the
crunching
of
the
gravel
aroused
her
attention
and
observing
her
visitors
she
sprang
up
and
hastened
toward
them
louise
introduced
her
uncle
and
herself
in
her
most
pleasant
and
gracious
way
and
the
school
teacher
led
them
to
a
garden
bench
and
begged
them
to
be
seated
the
day
is
lovely
she
said
and
i
always
find
my
garden
more
cheerful
than
the
house
grandfather
illness
makes
the
house
unpleasant
for
strangers
too
louise
was
surprised
at
this
frank
reference
and
uncle
john
coughed
to
hide
his
embarrassment
i
i
hope
the
invalid
is
is
improving
he
said
doubtful
whether
he
should
say
anything
on
the
delicate
subject
or
not
he
is
always
the
same
sir
was
the
quiet
response
i
suppose
they
have
told
you
that
grandfather
is
a
madman
our
great
trouble
is
well
known
in
this
neighborhood
he
is
not
dangerous
i
suppose
hazarded
uncle
john
remembering
the
brutal
bellowing
oh
not
at
all
he
is
fully
paralyzed
from
his
waist
down
poor
grandfather
and
can
do
no
harm
to
anyone
but
often
his
outbreaks
are
unpleasant
to
listen
to
continued
the
girl
deprecatingly
as
if
suddenly
conscious
that
they
had
overheard
the
recent
uproar
has
he
been
this
way
for
long
inquired
louise
his
mind
has
been
erratic
and
unbalanced
since
i
can
remember
answered
ethel
calmly
but
he
first
became
violent
at
the
time
captain
wegg
died
some
three
years
ago
grandfather
was
very
fond
of
the
captain
and
happened
to
be
with
him
at
the
time
of
his
sudden
death
the
shock
drove
him
mad
was
he
paralyzed
before
that
time
asked
louise
earnestly
no
but
the
paralysis
followed
almost
immediately
the
doctor
says
that
a
blood
vessel
which
burst
in
the
brain
is
responsible
for
both
afflictions
the
pause
that
followed
was
growing
awkward
when
uncle
john
said
with
an
evident
effort
to
change
the
subject
this
is
a
fine
old
homestead
it
is
indeed
responded
ethel
brightly
and
it
enjoys
the
distinction
of
being
one
of
the
first
houses
built
in
the
foothills
my
was
really
the
first
settler
in
these
parts
and
originally
located
his
cabin
where
the
mill
now
stands
bill
thompson
he
was
called
for
he
was
a
small
wiry
man
very
different
from
grandfather
who
in
his
prime
was
a
powerful
man
of
over
six
feet
little
bill
hill
and
little
bill
creek
were
named
after
this
pioneer
who
was
quite
successful
raising
flocks
of
sheep
on
the
plateau
before
he
died
he
built
this
house
preferring
the
location
to
his
first
one
the
garden
is
beautiful
said
louise
enthusiastically
and
do
you
teach
in
the
little
brick
across
the
way
yes
grandfather
built
it
years
ago
without
dreaming
i
would
ever
teach
there
now
the
county
supports
the
school
and
pays
me
my
salary
how
long
have
you
taught
for
two
years
it
is
necessary
now
that
grandfather
is
disabled
he
has
a
small
income
remaining
however
and
with
what
i
earn
we
get
along
very
nicely
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
assist
in
getting
our
house
ready
for
us
said
louise
we
might
have
found
things
in
sorry
condition
but
for
your
kindness
oh
i
enjoyed
the
work
i
assure
you
replied
ethel
as
it
is
my
vacation
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
me
to
have
something
to
do
but
i
fear
my
arrangement
of
your
pretty
furniture
was
very
ungraceful
we
have
altered
a
single
thing
declared
louise
you
must
have
found
it
a
tedious
task
unpacking
and
getting
everything
in
shape
tom
and
nora
were
good
help
because
they
are
fond
of
me
and
seem
to
understand
my
wishes
and
peggy
mcnutt
brought
me
some
men
to
do
the
lifting
and
rough
work
explained
ethel
have
you
known
hucks
and
his
wife
long
asked
uncle
john
since
i
can
remember
sir
they
came
here
many
years
ago
with
captain
wegg
and
has
thomas
always
smiled
louise
inquired
always
was
the
laughing
reply
it
an
odd
expression
is
it
to
dwell
forever
on
a
man
face
but
tom
is
never
angry
or
hurt
or
excited
by
anything
so
there
is
no
reason
he
should
not
smile
at
the
time
of
captain
wegg
death
and
poor
grandfather
terrible
affliction
old
hucks
kept
right
on
smiling
the
same
as
ever
and
perhaps
his
pleasant
face
helped
to
cheer
us
all
louise
drew
a
long
breath
then
the
smile
is
a
mask
she
said
and
is
assumed
to
conceal
the
man
real
feelings
i
do
not
think
so
ethel
answered
thoughtfully
the
smile
is
habitual
and
dominates
any
other
expression
his
features
might
be
capable
of
but
that
it
is
assumed
i
do
not
believe
thomas
is
a
old
fellow
and
to
face
the
world
smilingly
is
a
part
of
his
religion
i
am
sure
he
has
nothing
to
conceal
and
his
devotion
to
his
blind
wife
is
very
beautiful
but
nora
how
long
has
she
been
blind
perhaps
all
her
life
i
can
not
tell
how
long
yet
it
is
wonderful
how
perfectly
she
finds
her
way
without
the
aid
of
sight
captain
wegg
used
to
say
she
was
the
best
housekeeper
he
ever
knew
did
not
his
wife
keep
house
for
him
when
she
was
alive
i
do
not
remember
her
they
say
she
was
most
unhappy
ethel
dropped
her
eyes
and
did
not
reply
how
about
wegg
asked
uncle
john
did
you
like
him
you
see
we
mighty
curious
about
the
family
because
we
acquired
their
old
home
and
are
bound
to
be
interested
in
the
people
that
used
to
live
there
that
is
natural
remarked
the
little
school
teacher
with
a
sigh
captain
wegg
was
always
kind
to
me
but
the
neighbors
as
a
rule
thought
him
moody
and
after
a
pause
she
added
he
was
not
as
kind
to
his
son
as
to
me
but
i
think
his
life
was
an
unhappy
one
and
we
have
no
right
to
reprove
his
memory
too
severely
for
his
faults
what
made
him
unhappy
asked
louise
quickly
ethel
smiled
into
her
eager
face
no
one
has
solved
that
problem
they
say
the
captain
was
as
silent
as
he
was
morose
the
detective
instinct
was
alive
in
louise
she
hazarded
a
startling
query
who
killed
captain
wegg
she
demanded
suddenly
another
smile
preceded
the
reply
a
dreadful
foe
called
heart
disease
but
come
let
me
show
you
my
garden
there
are
no
such
roses
as
these
for
miles
around
louise
was
confident
she
had
made
progress
ethel
had
admitted
several
things
that
lent
countenance
to
the
suspicions
already
aroused
but
perhaps
this
simple
country
girl
had
never
imagined
the
tragedy
that
had
been
enacted
at
her
very
door
she
cordially
urged
ethel
thompson
to
spend
a
day
with
them
at
the
farm
and
uncle
john
who
was
pleased
with
the
modesty
and
frankness
of
the
little
school
teacher
earnestly
seconded
the
invitation
then
he
thought
of
going
home
and
the
thought
reminded
him
of
dan
do
you
know
he
inquired
where
i
could
buy
a
decent
horse
the
girl
looked
thoughtful
a
moment
then
glanced
up
with
a
bright
smile
will
you
buy
one
off
me
she
asked
willingly
my
dear
if
you
an
animal
to
sell
it
it
our
joe
he
was
grandfather
favorite
colt
when
his
trouble
came
upon
him
we
have
no
use
for
him
now
for
i
always
ride
or
drive
my
pony
and
grandmother
says
he
eating
his
head
off
to
no
purpose
so
we
like
to
sell
him
if
you
will
come
to
the
barn
i
introduce
you
to
him
joe
proved
on
inspection
to
be
an
excellent
horse
if
appearances
were
to
be
trusted
and
ethel
assured
merrick
that
the
steed
was
both
gentle
and
intelligent
do
you
use
that
surrey
inquired
uncle
john
pointing
to
a
neat
vehicle
that
seemed
to
be
nearly
new
very
seldom
sir
grandmother
would
like
to
sell
it
with
the
horse
it
exactly
what
i
need
declared
merrick
how
much
for
joe
and
his
harness
and
the
surrey
i
go
and
ask
what
grandmother
wants
she
returned
after
a
few
minutes
stating
a
figure
that
made
uncle
john
lift
his
brows
with
a
comical
expression
a
hundred
dollars
do
you
take
me
for
a
brigand
little
girl
i
know
what
horses
are
worth
for
i
bought
plenty
of
your
joe
seems
sound
as
a
dollar
and
he
just
in
his
prime
a
hundred
and
fifty
is
dirt
cheap
for
him
and
the
surrey
will
be
worth
at
least
put
in
the
harness
at
and
i
give
you
for
the
outfit
and
not
a
cent
more
or
less
eh
no
indeed
said
ethel
we
could
not
get
more
than
a
hundred
dollars
from
anyone
else
around
here
because
your
neighbors
are
countrymen
and
ca
afford
a
proper
investment
so
when
they
buy
at
all
they
only
give
about
half
what
a
thing
is
actually
worth
but
i
be
honest
with
you
the
price
i
offer
is
a
good
deal
less
than
i
have
to
pay
in
the
city
hutchinson
would
charge
me
five
hundred
at
least
and
i
need
just
what
you
got
to
sell
what
do
you
say
miss
ethel
the
price
is
one
hundred
dollars
mr
merrick
i
wo
pay
it
let
me
talk
with
your
grandmother
she
does
not
see
anyone
sir
louise
looked
up
sharply
scenting
another
clue
is
she
well
dear
she
asked
in
smooth
tones
she
looks
after
grandfather
and
helps
aunt
lucy
with
the
housework
well
come
louise
we
go
home
said
uncle
john
sadly
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
drive
this
fine
fellow
back
but
dan
have
to
groan
balk
all
the
way
to
the
farm
ethel
smiled
better
buy
at
my
price
merrick
she
suggested
tell
you
what
i
do
he
said
pausing
i
split
the
difference
take
two
hundred
and
well
call
it
a
bargain
but
i
can
not
do
that
sir
it
will
help
pay
you
for
the
hard
work
of
fixing
up
the
house
he
rejoined
pleadingly
your
bill
was
half
enough
my
bill
wonderingly
the
one
i
paid
mcnutt
for
your
services
i
made
no
charge
sir
i
could
not
accept
anything
for
a
bit
of
assistance
to
a
neighbor
oh
then
mcnutt
got
it
did
he
i
awfully
sorry
merrick
i
told
peggy
i
would
not
accept
payment
never
mind
we
not
going
to
quarrel
little
neighbor
may
i
hitch
joe
to
the
surrey
if
you
like
i
help
you
uncle
john
led
joe
from
his
stall
and
together
they
harnessed
the
horse
to
the
surrey
the
girl
knew
better
than
the
man
how
to
buckle
the
straps
properly
while
louise
stood
by
helplessly
and
watched
the
performance
then
uncle
john
went
for
old
dan
whom
he
led
rickety
buggy
and
all
into
the
thompson
stable
i
send
hucks
over
to
get
him
although
we
might
as
well
knock
him
in
the
head
he
said
as
he
unharnessed
the
ancient
steed
now
then
louise
hop
in
you
be
sure
to
come
over
thursday
for
the
day
miss
thompson
asked
louise
taking
joe
reins
from
her
uncle
hands
i
not
forget
such
a
delightful
engagement
be
sure
uncle
john
had
his
pocketbook
out
and
now
he
wadded
up
some
bills
and
thrust
them
into
the
little
school
teacher
hand
drive
ahead
louise
he
called
good
morning
my
dear
see
you
on
thursday
as
the
vehicle
rolled
out
of
the
yard
and
turned
into
the
highway
ethel
unrolled
the
bills
with
trembling
fingers
if
he
has
dared
she
began
but
paused
abruptly
with
a
smile
of
content
the
rich
man
had
given
her
exactly
one
hundred
dollars
chapter
ix
the
lives
of
the
saints
on
wednesday
afternoon
mcnutt
drove
the
sorrel
mare
over
to
the
wegg
farm
again
he
had
been
racking
his
brain
for
a
way
to
get
more
money
out
of
the
nabob
for
the
idea
had
become
a
veritable
passion
with
him
and
now
occupied
all
his
thoughts
that
very
morning
an
inspiration
had
come
to
him
among
other
occupations
he
had
at
one
time
adopted
that
of
a
and
by
dint
of
persistent
energy
had
sold
numerous
copies
of
radford
lives
of
the
saints
to
the
surrounding
farmers
they
had
cost
him
ninety
cents
a
copy
and
he
had
sold
them
at
three
dollars
each
netting
a
fine
profit
in
return
for
his
labor
the
books
were
printed
upon
cheap
paper
fearfully
illustrated
with
blurred
cuts
but
the
covers
were
bound
in
bright
red
with
gold
lettering
through
misunderstandings
three
of
these
copies
had
come
back
to
him
the
subscribers
refusing
to
accept
them
and
so
thorough
had
been
his
canvassing
that
there
remained
no
other
available
customers
for
the
saintly
works
so
peggy
had
kept
them
on
a
shelf
in
his
office
for
several
years
and
now
when
his
eye
chanced
to
light
upon
them
he
gave
a
snort
of
triumph
and
pounced
upon
them
eagerly
merrick
was
a
newcomer
without
doubt
he
could
be
induced
to
buy
a
copy
of
radford
lives
an
hour
later
mcnutt
was
on
his
mission
the
three
copies
which
had
been
carefully
dusted
reclining
on
the
buggy
seat
beside
him
arrived
at
the
wegg
farm
he
drove
up
to
the
stile
and
alighted
louise
was
reading
in
the
hammock
and
merely
glanced
at
the
little
man
who
solemnly
stumped
around
to
the
back
door
with
the
three
red
volumes
tucked
underneath
his
arm
he
had
brought
them
all
along
to
make
his
errand
look
like
business
where
the
nabob
he
asked
blind
nora
what
that
mr
mcnutt
she
inquired
as
if
puzzled
she
knew
his
voice
as
she
did
that
of
nearly
everyone
with
whom
she
had
ever
been
brought
in
contact
why
the
nabob
the
boss
mr
merrick
oh
he
in
the
barn
with
tom
i
guess
mcnutt
entered
the
barn
uncle
john
was
seated
upon
an
overturned
pail
watching
old
hucks
oil
joe
harness
the
agent
approached
him
with
a
deferential
bow
sir
said
he

comin
agin
so
soon
to
be
but
i
hev
here

copies

which
means
extry
fine
it
a
great
book
they

these
three
which
i
hai
no
doubt
many
folks
would
be
glad
to
give
their
weight
in
gold
fer
an
some
over
stand
out
of
the
light
mcnutt
the
agent
shifted
his
position
them
books
sir
oh
take
away
what
i
do
read
novels
mcnutt
scratched
his
head
perplexed
at
the
rebuff
his
dee
looks
speech
had
usually
resulted
in
a
sale
an
idea
flashed
across
his
brain
perhaps
evolved
by
the
scratching
the
young
lady
sir
oh
the
girls
are
loaded
with
books
growled
the
nabob
the
agent
became
desperate
but
the
young
lady
in
the
hammick
sir
as
i
jest
now
left
says
to
tell
ye
she
wants
one
o
these
books
mighty
bad
an
hopes
you
buy
it
for
her
eddificationing
oh
she
does
eh
mighty
bad
sir
uncle
john
watched
thomas
polish
a
buckle
is
it
a
moral
work
he
asked
nuthin
could
be
moraler
sir
all
the
lives
o
how
much
is
it
comes
pretty
high
sir
three
dollars
but
it
here
take
your
money
and
get

interrupting
me
very
sorry
sir
much
obleeged
sir
where
i
leave
the
book
throw
it
in
the
manger
mcnutt
selected
a
volume
that
had
a
broken
corner
and
laid
it
carefully
on
the
edge
of
the
then
he
put
his
money
in
his
pocket
and
turned
away
to
ye
mr
merrick
stop
a
bit
said
uncle
john
suddenly
the
agent
stopped
i
believe
i
paid
you
ten
dollars
for
miss
ethel
thompson
services
is
that
correct
ye
yes
mr
merrick
mcnutt
heart
was
in
his
shoes
and
he
looked
guiltily
at
his
accuser
the
pale
blue
eyes
bulging
fearfully
very
well
see
that
she
gets
it
of
course
mr
merrick
and
at
once
you
may
go
mcnutt
stumped
from
the
barn
he
felt
that
a
dreadful
catastrophe
had
overtaken
him
scarcely
could
he
restrain
the
impulse
to
sob
aloud
ten
dollars
ten
dollars
gone
to
the
dogs
as
the
result
of
his
visit
to
the
nabob
that
morning
to
lose
ten
dollars
in
order
to
gain
three
was
very
bad
business
policy
mcnutt
reflected
bitterly
that
he
would
have
been
better
off
had
he
stayed
at
home
he
ought
to
have
been
contented
with
what
he
had
already
made
and
the
severe
manner
the
nabob
had
used
in
addressing
him
told
the
agent
plainly
that
he
need
not
expect
further
pickings
from
this
source
in
the
midst
of
his
despair
the
comforting
thought
that
ethel
would
surely
refuse
the
money
came
to
sustain
him
so
he
recovered
somewhat
his
former
spirits
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
he
observed
louise
still
reading
in
the
hammock
in
some
ways
mcnutt
was
a
genius
he
did
not
neglect
opportunities
here
my
las
chance
at
these
idjits
he
muttered
an
i
learn
thet
nabob
what
it
costs
to
make
marsh
mcnutt
stand
his
light
then
he
hastened
over
to
the
hammock
me
miss
said
he
in
his
most
ingratiating
voice
is
yer
uncle
anywheres
is
he
in
the
barn
asked
the
girl
looking
up
ca
find
him
high
ner
low
but
he
ordered
a
book
of
me
day
lives
o
the
saints
an
perhaps
you
take
it
an
pay
me
the
money
so
i
kin
go
home
louise
gazed
at
the
man
musingly
he
was
one
of
the
people
she
intended
to
pump
for
information
concerning
the
mystery
of
captain
wegg
and
she
must
be
gracious
to
him
in
order
to
win
his
and
induce
him
to
speak
freely
with
this
thought
in
mind
she
drew
out
her
purse
and
asked
how
much
were
you
to
be
paid
for
the
book
three
dollars
miss
here
is
the
money
then
tell
me
your
name
is
mcnutt
is
it
how
long
have
you
lived
in
this
place
all
my
life
miss
thank
miss
good
day
to
ye
miss
he
placed
the
book
in
the
hammock
beside
her
do
go
please
said
the
girl
i
like
you
to
tell
me
something
about
captain
wegg
and
of
his
poor
wife
who
died
and
nuther
time
miss
i
be
glad
to
ye

in
my
orfice
any
time
jest
now
i
in
the
dumdest
hurry
ye
ever
knew
good
day
to
ye
miss
he
repeated
and
stumped
quickly
to
the
buggy
awaiting
him
next
moment
he
had
seized
the
reins
and
was
urging
the
sorrel
mare
along
the
stony
lane
at
her
best
pace
louise
was
both
astonished
and
disappointed
but
after
a
little
thought
she
looked
after
the
departing
agent
with
a
shrewd
smile
he
afraid
to
talk
she
murmured
and
that
only
confirms
my
suspicions
that
he
knows
more
than
he
cares
to
tell
meantime
mcnutt
was
doing
his
best
to
get
away
from
the
premises
before
the
discovery
was
made
that
he
had
sold
two
lives
of
the
saints
to
one
family
that
there
might
be
future
consequences
to
follow
his
deception
never
occurred
to
him
only
the
immediate
necessity
for
escape
occupied
his
mind
nor
were
his
fears
altogether
groundless
turning
his
head
from
time
to
time
for
a
glance
behind
he
had
seen
merrick
come
from
the
barn
with
a
red
book
in
his
hand
and
approach
the
hammock
whereupon
the
young
lady
arose
and
exhibited
a
second
book
then
they
both
dropped
the
books
and
ran
into
the
lane
and
began
shouting
for
him
to
stop
the
man
voice
sounding
especially
indignant
and
imperative
but
mcnutt
chose
to
be
deaf
he
did
not
look
around
again
and
was
congratulating
himself
that
he
would
soon
be
out
of
earshot
when
a
sudden
apparition
ahead
caused
the
mare
to
halt
abruptly
it
also
caused
the
cold
chills
to
run
down
the
agent
back
beth
and
patsy
had
stepped
into
the
lane
from
a
field
being
on
their
way
home
from
their
daily
walk
they
calling
to
you
sir
said
patsy
to
the
agent
did
you
hear
them
i
i
a
little
deaf
miss
stammered
mcnutt
who
recognized
the
young
ladies
as
merrick
nieces
i
think
they
wish
you
to
go
back
remarked
beth
thoughtfully
watching
the
frantic
waves
of
uncle
john
chubby
arms
and
louise
energetic
beckonings
they
were
too
far
off
to
be
heard
plainly
but
their
actions
might
surely
be
understood
mcnutt
with
reluctance
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
a
second
shudder
went
through
him
i
hai
got
time
to
go
back
he
said
as
an
inspiration
came
to
him
but
i
guess
you
kin
do
jest
as
well
this
book
here
picking
up
the
last
of
the
three
from
the
seat
i
offered
to
sell
yer
uncle
fer

volume
uncle
john
and
louise
glaring
at
the
distant
group
saw
the
third
red
book
change
hands
and
in
answer
to
their
renewed
cries
and
gestures
patsy
waved
the
lives
of
the
saints
at
them
reassuringly
and
came
on
at
a
brisk
walk
followed
by
beth
mcnutt
slapped
the
sorrel
with
the
ends
of
the
reins
so
energetically
that
the
mare
broke
into
a
trot
and
before
the
girls
had
come
within
speaking
distance
of
their
uncle
the
agent
was
well
out
of
sight
and
exulting
in
the
possession
of
eleven
dollars
to
pay
for
his
work
even
if
ethel
accepted
that
ten
he
reflected
he
would
still
be
a
dollar
ahead
but
he
was
sure
she
would
tell
him
to
keep
it
and
jest
like
to
see
thet
air
nabob
git
a
penny
back
agin
meantime
uncle
john
wrath
which
was
always
an
effervescent
quality
with
the
little
gentleman
had
changed
to
wonder
when
he
saw
his
nieces
approaching
with
the
third
book
louise
was
leaning
against
the
rail
fence
and
laughing
hysterically
and
suddenly
a
merry
smile
appeared
and
spread
over
her
uncle
round
face
as
he
said
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
an
audacious
swindle
in
all
your
born
days
what
will
you
do
uncle
asked
the
girl
wiping
the
tears
of
merriment
from
her
eyes
have
the
man
arrested
of
course
not
my
dear
it
worth
the
money
just
to
learn
what
talents
the
fellow
possesses
tell
me
patsy
he
continued
as
the
other
nieces
joined
them
what
did
you
pay
for
your
book
five
dollars
uncle
he
said
never
mind
what
he
said
my
dear
it
all
right
i
wanted
it
to
add
to
my
collection
so
far
i
got
three

chapter
x
the
mystery
deepens
ethel
thompson
came
over
the
next
day
as
she
had
promised
and
the
gentle
won
the
hearts
of
uncle
john
three
nieces
without
an
effort
she
was
the
eldest
of
them
all
but
her
retired
country
life
had
kept
her
fresh
and
natural
and
ethel
seemed
no
more
mature
than
the
younger
girls
except
in
a
certain
gravity
that
early
responsibility
had
thrust
upon
her
together
the
four
laughing
maids
wandered
through
the
pines
where
the
little
showed
them
many
pretty
nooks
and
mossy
banks
that
the
others
had
not
yet
discovered
by
following
an
unsuspected
path
they
cut
across
the
wooded
hills
to
the
waterfall
where
little
bill
creek
made
a
plunge
of
twenty
feet
into
a
rocky
basin
below
in
spite
of
the
bubbles
the
water
here
showed
clear
as
crystal
and
the
girls
admiringly
christened
it
the
champagne
cup
they
shed
their
shoes
and
stockings
and
waded
in
the
pool
enjoying
the
sport
with
shrieks
of
merry
laughter
more
because
they
were
happy
than
that
there
was
anything
to
laugh
at
afterward
they
traced
the
stream
down
to
a
lovely
glade
a
half
mile
above
millville
where
ethel
informed
them
the
annual
picnic
was
always
held
and
then
trailed
across
the
rocky
plateau
to
the
farm
by
the
time
they
reached
home
their
appetites
were
well
sharpened
for
mary
excellent
luncheon
and
the
afternoon
was
devoted
to
rest
under
the
shady
pines
that
grew
beside
the
house
it
was
now
when
they
felt
thoroughly
acquainted
and
at
ease
in
one
another
society
that
the
girls
indulged
in
talks
concerning
events
in
their
past
and
ethel
was
greatly
interested
in
the
nieces
recital
of
their
recent
trip
abroad
with
uncle
john
they
also
spoke
frankly
of
their
old
life
together
at
elmhurst
where
aunt
jane
who
was
uncle
john
sister
had
congregated
her
three
nieces
for
the
purpose
of
choosing
from
among
them
one
to
inherit
her
vast
estates
it
seemed
no
source
of
regret
to
any
of
them
that
a
boy
kenneth
forbes
had
finally
succeeded
to
aunt
jane
property
and
this
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
uncle
john
had
at
that
interesting
juncture
appeared
to
take
charge
of
the
nieces
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
eccentric
but
kindly
old
fellow
had
succeeded
in
making
these
three
girls
as
happy
as
their
dispositions
would
allow
them
to
be
after
the
most
interesting
phases
of
their
personal
history
had
been
discussed
the
nieces
began
perhaps
unconsciously
to
draw
from
ethel
her
own
story
it
was
simple
enough
and
derived
its
interest
mainly
from
the
fact
that
it
concerned
their
new
friend
her
parents
had
both
passed
away
while
she
was
young
and
ethel
had
always
lived
with
her
father
father
big
will
thompson
a
man
reputed
very
for
this
section
and
an
energetic
farmer
from
his
youth
old
will
had
always
been
accused
of
being
unsociable
and
considering
himself
above
the
neighboring
farmers
and
it
was
true
that
bob
west
the
implement
dealer
was
his
only
associate
before
captain
wegg
arrived
a
casual
acquaintance
with
the
millville
people
might
easily
explain
this
with
the
advent
of
the
weggs
however
a
strong
friendship
seemed
to
spring
up
between
the
retired
sea
captain
and
the
bluff
erratic
old
farmer
which
lasted
until
the
fatal
day
when
one
died
and
the
other
became
a
paralytic
and
a
maniac
we
have
always
thought
said
ethel
that
the
shock
of
the
death
unsettled
my
grandfather
mind
they
had
been
sitting
quietly
in
captain
wegg
room
one
evening
as
they
were
accustomed
to
do
when
there
was
a
sudden
fall
and
a
cry
thomas
ran
in
at
once
and
found
grandfather
raving
over
the
captain
dead
body
the
old
seaman
had
heart
disease
it
seems
and
had
often
declared
he
would
die
suddenly
it
was
a
great
blow
to
us
all
but
especially
to
joe
her
voice
softened
at
this
last
remark
and
patsy
exclaimed
impulsively
tell
us
about
joe
wegg
did
you
like
him
yes
said
ethel
simply
we
were
naturally
thrown
much
together
in
our
childhood
and
became
staunch
friends
grandpa
often
took
me
with
him
on
his
visits
to
the
weggs
and
sometimes
but
not
often
the
captain
would
bring
joe
to
see
us
he
was
a
quiet
thoughtful
boy
much
like
his
mother
i
imagine
but
for
some
reason
he
had
conceived
an
intense
dislike
for
his
father
and
an
open
hatred
for
this
part
of
the
country
where
he
was
born
aside
from
these
morbid
notions
joe
was
and
frank
and
genuine
had
he
been
educated
in
any
other
atmosphere
than
the
gloomy
one
of
the
wegg
household
i
am
sure
character
would
have
been
wholly
admirable
and
i
have
never
blamed
the
boy
much
for
his
peculiarities
captain
wegg
would
not
permit
him
to
go
to
school
but
himself
attended
to
such
instructions
as
joe
could
acquire
at
home
and
this
was
so
meager
and
the
boy
so
ambitious
that
i
think
it
was
one
cause
of
his
discontent
i
remember
when
i
was
sent
to
school
at
troy
that
joe
sobbed
for
days
because
he
could
not
have
the
same
advantages
he
used
to
tell
me
wonderful
stories
of
what
he
would
accomplish
if
he
could
only
get
out
into
the
world
when
he
implored
his
father
to
let
him
go
away
captain
wegg
used
to
assure
joe
that
he
would
some
day
be
rich
and
there
was
no
need
of
his
preparing
himself
for
either
a
business
or
a
profession
but
that
did
not
satisfy
joe
ambition
as
you
may
imagine
and
when
the
end
came
scarcely
a
dollar
of
money
could
be
found
among
the
possessions
and
no
other
property
than
this
farm
so
it
is
evident
he
deceived
his
son
for
some
selfish
purpose
joe
was
at
last
free
and
the
only
thing
i
reproach
him
for
is
going
away
without
a
word
to
me
or
any
of
his
friends
i
heard
indirectly
of
his
working
his
way
through
a
technical
school
for
he
was
always
crazy
about
mechanics
and
then
he
went
to
new
york
and
i
lost
all
further
trace
of
him
what
do
you
suppose
became
of
captain
wegg
money
asked
louise
i
no
idea
it
is
a
singular
thing
that
most
of
my
savings
disappeared
at
the
same
time
on
account
of
his
mental
condition
he
can
never
tell
us
what
became
of
his
little
fortune
but
luckily
the
returns
from
the
farm
which
we
rent
on
shares
and
my
own
salary
as
teacher
of
the
district
school
enable
us
to
live
quite
comfortably
although
we
must
be
economical
why
it
really
a
romance
cried
patsy
who
had
listened
eagerly
there
are
many
romances
in
real
life
added
beth
in
her
undemonstrative
way
louise
said
nothing
but
her
heart
was
throbbing
with
excitement
engendered
by
the
tale
which
so
strongly
corroborated
the
suspicions
she
had
begun
to
entertain
when
ethel
had
gone
home
louise
still
deliberated
upon
this
fascinating
mystery
and
her
resolve
grew
to
force
some
sort
of
an
explanation
from
the
smiling
lips
of
old
hucks
for
the
sole
available
witness
of
that
fatal
night
tragedy
when
one
strong
man
died
and
another
was
driven
mad
was
thomas
hucks
the
old
servitor
was
also
in
a
position
to
know
much
of
the
causes
leading
up
to
the
catastrophe
he
having
been
the
confidential
retainer
of
captain
wegg
for
many
years
hucks
must
speak
but
the
girl
was
wise
enough
to
realize
that
he
would
not
do
so
unless
urged
by
coaxing
or
forced
by
strategy
there
was
doubtless
good
reason
why
the
old
man
had
remained
silent
for
three
years
her
plan
was
to
win
his
confidence
interest
him
in
joe
welfare
and
then
the
truth
must
come
out
the
frankly
related
story
of
ethel
had
supplied
louise
with
the
motive
for
the
crime
for
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
she
was
now
doubly
sure
captain
wegg
had
money
old
will
thompson
had
money
both
were
men
in
a
retired
country
district
where
there
were
no
banks
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
they
kept
large
sums
of
money
on
hand
and
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
had
tempted
some
one
to
a
dreadful
deed
captain
wegg
had
been
killed
and
old
thompson
perhaps
injured
by
a
blow
upon
the
head
from
which
he
had
never
recovered
any
suspicion
the
fair
young
detective
may
have
entertained
that
thompson
himself
had
killed
his
friend
was
eradicated
by
the
fact
that
he
had
been
robbed
at
the
same
time
louise
had
originally
undertaken
her
investigation
through
curiosity
and
a
desire
to
amuse
herself
by
unveiling
the
mystery
now
she
began
to
reflect
that
she
was
an
instrument
of
justice
for
a
discovery
of
the
truth
might
restore
a
fortune
to
poor
joe
wegg
now
struggling
with
the
world
and
put
sweet
ethel
thompson
in
a
position
where
the
necessity
for
her
to
teach
school
would
be
abolished
this
thought
added
a
strong
impulse
to
her
determination
to
succeed
sunday
afternoon
the
girl
took
blind
nora
for
a
long
drive
through
the
country
taking
pains
to
explain
to
her
all
the
points
of
interest
they
came
to
and
delighting
the
old
woman
with
her
bright
chatter
louise
had
been
kind
to
nora
from
the
beginning
and
her
soft
sympathetic
voice
had
quite
won
the
poor
creature
heart
on
the
way
home
in
the
delightful
summer
twilight
the
girl
dexterously
led
the
conversation
toward
nora
past

thomas

sailor
when
you
married
him
she
asked
yes

the
old
woman
was
silent
for
a
time
then
she
said
i
better
not
mention
it
i
guess
thomas
likes
to
forgit
an
when
i
gets
cryin
an
nervous
he

been
thinkin
the

louise
was
disappointed
but
changed
the
subject
adroitly
and
miss

who
was
afterward
wegg
did
you

indeed
i
did

an
her
fambily

that
proud
aristocratic
thet
no

i

thet
he
thought
the
world

in

oh
i
had
an
idea
he
did
treat
her
well
remarked
the
girl
soberly
that
wrong
declared
nora
promptly
arter
the
trouble

fer
it
come
to
the
weggs
as
well
as
to

ye
see
an
that
made
it
a
gloomy
house
an
no
mistake
do
you
mean
after
you
moved
here
to
the
farm
yes
deary
i
hear
captain
wegg
was
very
fond
of
ethel
grandfather
continued
louise
trying
to
find
an
opening
to
penetrate
old
nora
reserve
they
was
good
friends
always
was
the
brief
reply
did
they
ever
quarrel
nora
never
that
i
knows
of
and
what
do
you
suppose
became
of
their
money
asked
the
girl
i
do
know
child
air
we
gettin
near
home
we
are
quite
near
now
i
wish
you
would
open
your
heart
to
me
and
tell
me
about
that
great
trouble
nora
i
might
be
able
to
comfort
you
in
some
way
the
blind
woman
shook
her
head
there
no
comfort
but
in
forgettin
she
said
an
the
way
to
forgit
ai
to
talk
about
it
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
this
conversation
did
not
discourage
louise
although
she
was
sorry
to
meet
with
no
better
success
gradually
she
was
learning
the
inside
history
of
the
weggs
when
she
discovered
what
that
great
trouble
had
been
she
would
secure
an
important
clue
in
the
mystery
she
was
sure
nora
might
some
time
be
induced
to
speak
more
freely
and
it
was
possible
she
might
get
the
desired
information
from
old
hucks
she
would
try
anyway
a
dozen
theories
might
be
constructed
to
account
for
this
great
trouble
the
one
that
louise
finally
favored
was
that
captain
wegg
had
been
guilty
of
some
crime
on
the
high
seas
in
which
his
boatswain
old
hucks
was
likewise
implicated
they
were
obliged
to
abandon
the
sea
and
fly
to
some
corner
inland
where
they
could
be
safely
hidden
and
their
whereabouts
never
discovered
it
was
the
knowledge
of
this
crime
she
conjectured
that
had
ruined
sweet
wegg
life
and
made
her
weep
day
after
day
until
her
guilty
husband
became
surly
and
silent
and
unsociable
louise
now
began
to
cultivate
thomas
but
her
progress
was
slow
patsy
seemed
to
be
the
old
man
favorite
and
for
some
reason
he
became
glum
and
uncommunicative
whenever
louise
was
around
the
girl
suspected
that
nora
had
told
her
husband
of
the
recent
conversation
in
spite
of
her
assertion
that
she
wished
to
avoid
all
reference
to
their
great
trouble
chapter
xi
three
amateur
detectives
puzzling
her
brain
what
to
do
next
louise
suddenly
decided
to
confide
her
secret
to
her
two
cousins
not
that
she
considered
them
capable
of
a
greater
success
than
she
could
herself
accomplish
but
they
might
prove
valuable
assistants
in
the
capacity
of
lieutenants
she
had
great
respect
for
beth
calm
judgment
and
keen
intuitions
and
patsy
had
a
way
of
accomplishing
difficult
things
with
ease
the
two
girls
listened
to
louise
with
expressions
of
mingled
wonder
and
amusement
while
she
confided
to
them
her
first
suspicions
that
captain
wegg
had
been
murdered
and
then
the
bits
of
information
she
had
gathered
to
strengthen
the
surmise
and
assure
her
she
was
justified
in
her
efforts
to
untangle
the
web
of
mystery
you
see
my
dears
she
explained
impressively
as
the
three
lounged
upon
the
grass
in
the
shade
of
the
right
wing
of
the
house
there
is
a
very
interesting
story
about
these
people
that
ought
to
guide
us
directly
to
a
solution
of
the
puzzle
a
roving
sea
captain
marries
a
girl
of
good
family
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
her
relatives
his
boatswain
a
confidential
servant
marries
the
girl
maid
the
next
thing
we
know
is
that
a
trouble
causes
them
to
flee
doubtless
some
crime
committed
by
the
captain
it
may
have
been
robbery
or
perhaps
piracy
on
the
high
seas
who
knows
anyhow
he
steals
away
to
this
forsaken
spot
far
from
the
sea
or
the
railroads
and
builds
a
fine
house
on
a
worthless
farm
showing
that
he
has
money
but
that
retirement
is
his
main
object
here
the
weggs
make
no
friends
but
the
wife
cries
her
eyes
out
until
she
dies
miserably
leaving
a
son
to
the
tender
mercies
of
a
wicked
father
so
fearful
is
he
of
discovery
that
he
will
not
allow
the
boy
to
go
to
school
but
tries
to
educate
him
himself
probably
the
captain
real
name
was
not
wegg
at
all
suggested
patsy
entering
into
the
spirit
of
the
relation
probably
not
dear
he
would
assume
some
name
of
course
so
that
it
might
be
more
difficult
to
trace
him
answered
louise
but
now
mark
me
well
girls
a
nemesis
was
on
the
track
of
this
wicked
sinner
after
many
years
the
man
captain
wegg
had
wronged
or
stolen
from
or
something
discovered
his
enemy
hiding
place
he
promptly
killed
the
captain
and
probably
recovered
the
money
for
it
gone
old
thompson
ethel
grandfather
happened
to
be
present
the
murderer
also
took
his
money
and
oh
louise
that
is
reasonable
objected
beth
who
had
been
following
the
story
carefully
why
not
because
you
are
making
the
wronged
party
as
wicked
as
the
man
who
wronged
him
when
the
avenger
found
his
enemy
he
might
force
him
to
give
up
his
gains
i
agree
with
you
there
but
he
would
be
liable
to
rob
old
thompson
i
sure
beth
is
right
said
patsy
stoutly
but
old
thompson
lost
his
money
at
the
same
time
you
know
at
least
his
money
could
never
be
found
afterward
and
i
sure
he
was
dealt
some
blow
on
the
head
that
made
him
crazy
answered
louise
positively
they
thought
that
over
i
believe
i
can
explain
it
girls
said
beth
presently
the
avenger
found
captain
wegg
all
right
just
as
louise
has
said
and
when
he
found
him
he
demanded
a
restitution
of
his
money
threatening
to
send
the
criminal
to
jail
that
would
be
very
natural
would
it
well
captain
wegg
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
the
money
and
could
pay
it
all
back
so
ethel
grandfather
being
his
friend
offered
to
makeup
the
balance
himself
rather
than
see
his
friend
go
to
prison
that
accounts
for
the
disappearance
of
all
the
money
if
that
is
so
observed
patsy
i
do
see
why
the
man
having
got
his
money
back
should
murder
one
and
knock
the
other
on
the
head
it
way
a
puzzle
they
all
acknowledged
and
after
discussing
the
matter
from
every
conceivable
standpoint
they
were
no
nearer
an
explanation
that
the
way
with
mysteries
they
often
hard
to
understand
the
only
thing
that
occurs
to
me
as
being
sensible
said
louise
finally
is
that
after
the
money
was
paid
over
they
got
into
a
quarrel
then
the
avenger
lost
his
temper
and
committed
the
murders
this
talk
about
an
avenger
is
all
guess
work
asserted
beth
calmly
i
do
believe
the
facts
point
to
an
avenger
at
all
but
the
old
crime
the
great
trouble
oh
we
allow
all
that
returned
beth
and
i
do
say
that
an
avenger
would
be
the
nicest
person
to
exact
retribution
from
the
wicked
captain
but
avengers
do
always
turn
up
in
real
life
when
they
ought
to
girls
so
we
must
be
too
sure
that
one
turned
up
in
this
case
but
now
else
can
you
account
for
the
captain
murder
objected
louise
well
some
one
else
might
know
he
had
money
and
that
grandfather
had
money
too
was
the
reply
suppose
the
robbery
and
murder
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
old
crime
at
all
but
that
the
murderer
knew
this
to
be
a
deserted
place
where
he
could
make
a
good
haul
without
being
discovered
the
two
old
men
sat
in
the
right
wing
quite
unsuspicious
when
when
in
walks
murderer
chokes
the
captain
knocks
his
friend
on
the
and
makes
off
with
the
money
continued
patsy
gleefully
oh
girls
i
sure
we
got
it
right
this
time
louise
reflected
a
moment
this
country
is
almost
a
wilderness
she
mused
aloud
and
few
strangers
ever
come
here
besides
a
stranger
would
not
know
positively
that
these
two
men
had
money
if
we
abandon
the
idea
of
an
avenger
and
follow
beth
clue
then
the
murderer
is
still
right
here
in
millville
and
unsuspected
by
any
of
his
neighbors
oh
louise
with
startled
glances
over
their
shoulders
let
us
be
sensible
reasoning
girls
not
silly
things
trying
to
figure
out
possible
romances
continued
louise
with
a
pretty
and
impressive
assumption
of
dignity
do
you
know
i
feel
that
some
angel
of
retribution
has
guided
us
to
this
lonely
farmhouse
and
put
the
idea
into
my
head
to
discover
and
expose
a
dreadful
crime
succotash
cried
patsy
irrelevantly
you
romancing
this
minute
louise
the
way
you
figure
things
out
i
would
be
surprised
if
you
accused
me
or
uncle
john
any
time
during
the
next
half
hour
adopting
your
last
supposition
for
the
sake
of
argument
i
interested
to
know
what
inhabitant
of
sleepy
old
millville
you
suspect
do
get
flighty
patricia
admonished
beth
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
louise
is
in
earnest
if
we
going
to
help
her
we
talk
rubbish
now
it
is
a
bad
suggestion
that
we
ought
to
look
nearer
home
for
the
key
to
this
mystery
there
old
hucks
hucks
to
be
sure
no
one
knew
so
well
as
he
the
money
affairs
of
the
two
men
who
were
robbed
i
ashamed
of
you
said
patsy
and
the
man
smile
is
a
mask
exclaimed
louise
oh
no
protested
patsy
my
dear
no
person
who
ever
lived
could
smile
every
minute
winter
and
summer
rain
or
shine
day
and
night
and
always
have
a
reason
for
the
smile
of
course
not
agreed
beth
old
hucks
is
a
curious
character
i
realized
that
when
i
had
known
him
five
minutes
but
he
poor
urged
patsy
in
defense
of
the
old
man
he
has
a
penny
in
the
world
and
mcnutt
told
me
if
we
turned
thomas
and
nora
away
they
have
to
go
to
the
poorhouse
that
is
no
argument
at
all
said
louise
calmly
if
we
consider
the
fact
that
old
hucks
may
be
a
miser
and
have
a
craving
for
money
without
any
desire
to
spend
it
then
we
are
pretty
close
to
a
reason
why
he
should
bide
his
time
and
then
murder
his
old
master
to
obtain
the
riches
he
coveted
mind
you
i
do
say
hucks
is
guilty
but
it
is
our
duty
to
consider
this
phase
of
the
question
and
then
added
beth
if
hucks
should
prove
to
be
a
miser
it
is
easy
to
guess
he
would
hide
his
wealth
where
he
could
secretly
gloat
over
it
and
still
continue
to
pose
as
a
pauper
i
do
believe
it
said
patsy
stoutly
you
never
make
a
successful
detective
if
you
allow
your
personal
feelings
to
influence
you
returned
louise
i
too
sincerely
hope
that
thomas
is
innocent
but
we
are
not
justified
in
acquitting
him
until
we
have
made
a
careful
investigation
and
watched
his
actions
i
quite
sure
he
connected
with
the
mystery
in
some
way
said
beth
it
will
do
no
harm
to
watch
old
hucks
as
louise
suggests
and
you
might
try
to
pump
him
patsy
and
see
if
you
can
get
him
to
talk
of
the
murder
some
careless
remark
might
give
us
just
the
clue
we
need
and
guide
us
to
the
real
criminal
that
would
free
thomas
from
all
suspicion
you
see
but
why
do
you
ask
me
to
do
this
demanded
patsy
thomas
and
i
are
good
friends
and
i
feel
like
a
traitor
to
try
to
get
him
to
confess
a
murder
if
he
is
innocent
you
have
done
no
harm
said
her
eldest
cousin
and
if
he
is
guilty
you
do
want
him
for
your
friend
he
likes
you
dear
added
beth
and
perhaps
he
will
tell
you
frankly
all
we
want
to
know
there
another
person
though
louise
who
might
tell
us
something
who
is
that
the
little
man
with
the
eyes
mcnutt
now
there
some
sense
in
suspecting
him
exclaimed
patsy
we
know
he
a
robber
already
and
a
man
who
is
clever
enough
to
sell
uncle
john
three
of
the
saints
would
stick
at
nothing
i
sure
he
has
enough
courage
to
commit
a
great
crime
observed
beth
but
he
may
be
able
to
give
us
some
information
louise
asserted
so
i
propose
we
walk
over
to
the
town
tomorrow
morning
and
interview
him
this
was
promptly
agreed
to
for
even
patsy
the
least
enthusiastic
detective
of
the
three
was
eager
to
find
some
sort
of
a
solution
of
the
wegg
mystery
meantime
they
decided
to
watch
old
hucks
very
carefully
beth
happened
to
be
present
when
uncle
john
paid
thomas
his
weekly
wage
that
evening
and
was
interested
to
notice
how
the
old
man
hand
trembled
with
eagerness
as
he
took
the
money
how
much
are
you
accustomed
to
receive
uncle
john
had
asked
nothing
sir
since
wegg
died
was
the
reply
we
was
glad
enough
to
have
a
home
nora
an
me
wages
and
there
was
no
one
here
for
you
to
serve
mused
uncle
john
but
in
captain
wegg
day
how
much
did
he
give
you
thomas
hesitated
and
his
smile
wavered
an
instant
my
old
master
was
also
my
old
friend
said
he
in
a
low
voice
an
i
ast
him
fer
little
money
because
my
needs
were
little
well
the
conditions
are
now
different
remarked
uncle
john
carelessly
and
while
you
are
in
my
employ
you
shall
have
your
wages
regularly
will
ten
dollars
a
week
be
satisfactory
oh
sir
and
five
for
nora
you
are
too
good
sir
i
i
never
mind
thomas
if
you
want
more
at
any
time
let
me
know
it
was
then
as
the
old
man
took
the
fifteen
dollars
extended
to
him
that
beth
noted
a
flash
in
the
mild
blue
eyes
and
a
trembling
of
the
horny
hands
hucks
was
very
glad
to
get
the
money
there
was
little
doubt
of
that
she
spoke
of
this
incident
to
louise
and
the
following
morning
they
tested
the
man
again
all
three
girls
being
present
beth
tendered
old
hucks
two
dollars
saying
it
was
intended
as
a
slight
mark
of
her
appreciation
of
his
attention
thomas
demurred
at
first
but
on
being
urged
took
the
money
with
the
same
eager
gesture
he
had
before
displayed
louise
followed
with
a
donation
of
a
like
sum
and
patsy
gave
the
old
man
still
another
two
dollar
bill
this
generosity
so
amazed
him
that
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
as
he
tried
to
thank
them
all
it
was
noticed
that
the
smile
did
not
give
way
even
to
the
tears
although
it
was
tinged
with
a
pathetic
expression
that
proved
wonderfully
affecting
he
concealed
the
offerings
with
a
stealthy
motion
as
if
ashamed
of
his
weakness
in
accepting
them
and
then
hurried
away
to
his
work
well
said
louise
when
they
were
alone
is
thomas
a
miser
or
not
he
clutched
the
money
almost
as
if
he
loved
it
observed
beth
in
a
musing
and
slightly
regretful
tone
but
think
how
poor
he
has
been
pleaded
patsy
and
how
destitute
both
he
and
nora
are
yet
can
we
blame
him
for
being
glad
to
earn
something
substantial
at
last
somehow
that
did
not
seem
to
explain
fully
the
old
man
behavior
and
the
girl
who
had
championed
him
sighed
and
then
gave
a
sudden
shiver
as
she
remembered
the
awful
suspicion
that
had
fallen
upon
this
strange
individual
if
the
proof
must
be
accepted
that
hucks
had
miserly
instincts
had
not
beth
accidentally
stumbled
upon
a
solution
of
the
whole
mystery
but
patsy
would
not
believe
it
if
thomas
open
countenance
lied
it
was
hard
to
put
faith
in
any
one
chapter
xii
the
baiting
of
peggy
by
this
time
the
three
nieces
were
so
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
task
they
had
undertaken
that
more
ordinary
things
failed
to
interest
them
louise
longed
to
solve
the
mystery
beth
wanted
to
punish
the
wrongdoers
patsy
yearned
to
exonerate
the
friends
whom
she
imagined
unjustly
accused
therefore
the
triple
alliance
for
detective
purposes
was
a
strong
one
by
mutual
agreement
they
kept
the
matter
secret
from
uncle
john
for
they
realized
what
a
triumph
it
would
be
to
surprise
the
old
gentleman
with
proofs
of
their
cleverness
to
confide
in
him
now
would
mean
to
invite
no
end
of
ridicule
or
good
natured
raillery
for
uncle
john
had
not
a
grain
of
imagination
or
romance
in
his
nature
and
would
be
unable
to
comprehend
the
delights
of
this
secret
investigation
because
he
was
in
the
dark
the
significant
looks
and
unnatural
gravity
of
his
nieces
in
the
succeeding
days
puzzled
the
poor
man
greatly
what
wrong
girls
he
would
ask
are
you
happy
here
do
you
miss
anything
you
like
is
it
too
quiet
and
dull
at
millville
to
suit
you
oh
no
they
would
exclaim
we
are
having
a
splendid
time
and
would
not
leave
the
farm
for
anything
and
he
often
noticed
them
grouped
in
isolated
places
and
conversing
in
low
eager
tones
that
proved
something
was
up
he
felt
somewhat
grieved
that
he
was
not
their
confidant
since
these
girls
and
their
loyal
affection
for
him
constituted
the
chief
joy
of
his
life
when
he
put
on
his
regulation
fishing
costume
and
carried
his
expensive
rod
and
reel
his
landing
net
and
creel
to
the
brook
for
a
day
sport
he
could
no
longer
induce
one
of
his
girls
to
accompany
him
even
patsy
pleaded
laughingly
that
she
had
certain
fish
to
fry
that
were
not
to
be
found
in
the
brook
soon
the
three
nieces
made
their
proposed
visit
to
mcnutt
their
idea
being
to
pump
that
individual
until
he
was
dry
of
any
information
he
might
possess
concerning
the
wegg
mystery
they
tramped
over
to
the
village
after
breakfast
one
morning
and
found
the
agent
seated
on
the
porch
before
his
little
office
by
which
name
the
front
room
of
his
cottage
was
dignified
he
was
dressed
in
faded
overalls
a
checked
shirt
and
a
cheap
straw
hat
his
off
foot
as
he
called
it
with
grim
humor
was
painted
green
and
his
other
foot
was
bare
and
might
have
been
improved
in
color
both
these
extremities
rested
on
the
rail
of
the
porch
while
mcnutt
smoked
a
corncob
pipe
and
stared
at
his
approaching
visitors
with
his
disconcerting
protruding
eyes
good
morning
mcnutt
said
louise
pleasantly
we
come
to
see
if
you
have
any
books
to
sell
the
agent
drew
a
long
breath
he
had
at
first
believed
they
had
come
to
reproach
him
for
his
cruel
deception
for
although
his
conscience
was
wholly
dormant
he
had
at
times
been
a
bit
uneasy
concerning
his
remarkable
book
trade
uncle
is
making
a
collection
of
the
of
the
saints
announced
patsy
demurely
at
present
he
has
but
three
varieties
of
this
work
one
with
several
pages
missing
another
printed
partly
upside
down
and
a
third
with
a
broken
corner
he
is
anxious
to
secure
some
further
variations
of
the
looks
lives
if
you
can
supply
them
peggy
eyes
could
stare
any
harder
so
they
just
stared
i
i
hai
got
no
more
on
hand
he
stammered
fairly
nonplussed
by
the
remarkable
statement
no
more
oh
how
sad
how
disappointed
we
are
said
beth
we
were
depending
so
much
on
you
mcnutt
added
louise
in
a
tone
of
gentle
reproach
mcnutt
wiggled
the
toes
of
his
good
foot
and
regarded
them
reflectively
these
city
folks
were
surely
the
easiest
marks
he
had
ever
come
across
ef
ye
could
wait
a
few
days
he
began
hopefully
i
might
oh
no
we
ca
possibly
wait
a
single
minute
declared
patsy
unless
uncle
can
get
the
saints
right
away
he
will
lose
interest
in
the
collection
and
then
he
wo
care
for
them
at
all
mcnutt
sighed
dismally
here
was
a
chance
to
make
good
money
by
fleecing
the
lambs
yet
he
was
absolutely
unable
to
take
advantage
of
it
ye
ye
could
use
any
duck
eggs
could
ye
he
said
a
sudden
thought
seeming
to
furnish
him
with
a
brilliant
idea
duck
eggs
i
got
the
extry
fine
lot
o
duck
eggs
ye
ever
seen
but
what
can
we
do
with
duck
eggs
inquired
beth
wonderingly
while
patsy
and
louise
tried
hard
not
to
shriek
with
laughter
set
under
a
hen
an
hatch
out
sir
said
beth
i
strongly
disapprove
of
such
deceptions
it
seems
to
me
that
making
a
poor
hen
hatch
out
ducks
under
the
delusion
that
they
are
chickens
is
one
of
the
most
cruel
and
treacherous
acts
that
humanity
can
be
guilty
of
imagine
the
poor
thing
feelings
when
her
children
take
to
water
i
surprised
you
could
suggest
such
a
wicked
use
for
duck
eggs
mcnutt
wiggled
his
toes
again
desperately
ca
use
any
roots
can
ye
no
indeed
all
we
crave
is
the
of
the
saints
do
want
to
buy
no
land
what
have
you
got
to
sell
jest
now
but
ef
ye
buy
i
kin
git
anything
do
go
to
any
trouble
on
our
account
sir
we
are
quite
content
with
our
splendid
farm
shoo
thet
ai
no
good
captain
wegg
thought
it
was
answered
louise
quickly
seizing
this
opening
otherwise
he
would
not
have
built
so
good
a
house
upon
it
the
were
plumb
crazy
declared
the
agent
emphatically
he
did
want
ter
farm
when
he
come
here
he
jest
wanted
to
hide
the
girls
exchanged
quick
glances
of
intelligence
why
why
repeated
mcnutt
thet
a
thing
what
puzzled
us
fer
years
miss
some
thinks
wegg
were
a
piret
some
thinks
he
kidnaped
thet
pretty
wife
o
an
took
her
money
some
thinks
he
tried
to
rob
ol
will
thompson
an
will
killed
him
an
then
went
crazy
hisself
there
all
sorts
o
thinks
goin
but
who
do
you
mr
mcnutt
the
agent
was
flattered
by
the
question
as
he
had
said
the
weggs
had
formed
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
in
millville
for
years
and
no
one
had
a
more
vivid
interest
in
their
history
than
marshall
mcmahon
mcnutt
he
enjoyed
gossiping
about
the
weggs
almost
as
much
as
he
did
selling
books
i
never
thought
i
had
no
call
to
stick
my
nose
inter
other
folkses
privit
doin
he
said
after
a
few
puffs
at
the
corncob
pipe
but
they
kai
hide
much
from
marsh
mcnutt
when
he
has
his
eyes
open
patsy
wondered
if
he
could
possibly
close
them
the
eyelids
seemed
to
be
shy
and
retiring
i
seen
what
i
seen
continued
the
little
man
glancing
impressively
at
his
attentive
audience
i
seen
wegg
livin
without
workin
fer
he
never
lifted
a
hand
to
do
even
a
chore
i
seen
him
jest
an
smokin
his
pipe
an
a
glowerin
like
a
devil
on
thet
come
near
say
once
he
ordered
me
his
premises
me
what
a
dreadful
man
said
patsy
did
he
buy
any
of
the
saints
not
a
life
he
made
poor
ol
hucks
fetch
an
carry
fer
him
blessid
minnit
an
never
paid
him
no
wages
are
you
sure
asked
louise
sure
as
shootin
hucks
hai
never
been
seen
to
spend
a
cent
in
all
the
years
he
been
here
has
he
sold
berries
and
fruit
since
the
captain
death
jest
to
pay
the
taxes
which
ai
much
ye
see
young
joe
were
away
an
could
raise
the
tax
money
so
ol
hucks
had
to
but
how
they
got
enough
ter
live
on
him
an
nora
beats
me
perhaps
captain
wegg
left
some
money
suggested
patsy
no
when
joe
an
hucks
ransacked
the
house
arter
the
death
they
could
find
a
dollar
plenty
o
money
till
he
died
then
not
a
red
cent
curiouser
yet
ol
will
thompson
savin
too
an
never
could
be
located
to
this
day
were
they
robbed
do
you
suppose
asked
louise
but
who
done
it
not
ol
hucks
fer
he
too
honest
has
showed
the
color
of
a
nickel
sense
not
joe
he
had
to
borrer
five
dollars
of
bob
west
to
git
to
the
city
with
who
then
perhaps
said
louise
slowly
some
burglar
did
it
ai
no
burglers
these
parts
i
suppose
not
only
book
agents
remarked
beth
mcnutt
flushed
do
ye
mean
as
i
did
it
he
demanded
angrily
do
ye
mean
as
i
killed
wegg
an
druv
will
crazy
an
robbed
the
house
his
features
were
fairly
contorted
and
his
colorless
eyes
rolled
fearfully
if
you
did
said
beth
coolly
you
would
be
sure
to
deny
it
i
kin
prove
a
alybi
answered
the
little
man
calming
down
somewhat
i
kin
prove
my
ol
woman
had
me
locked
up
in
the
thet
night
i
would
split
a
lot
o
cordwood
thet
were
full
knots
he
cast
a
half
fearful
glance
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
interior
of
the
cottage
next
day
i
split
he
added
mildly
perhaps
said
louise
again
someone
who
knew
captain
wegg
in
the
days
before
he
came
here
followed
him
to
his
retreat
and
robbed
and
murdered
him
now
ye
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
cried
the
agent
slapping
his
fat
thigh
energetically
thet
what
i
allus
claimed
even
when
bob
west
jest
shook
his
head
an
smiled
sort
o
superior
like
who
is
bob
west
asked
louise
with
interest
he
our
implement
man
an
hardware
dealer
bob
were
the
one
the
millville
folks
thet
could
git
along
with
wegg
an
even
he
did
manage
to
be
any
special
friend
bob
rich
ye
know
rich
as
blazes
folks
do
say
he
wuth
ten
thousan
dollars
but
it
do
set

any
he
jest
minds
his
business
an
goes
on
sellin
plows
harvesters
to
the
farmers
an
takin

you
say
he
knew

well
inquired
patsy
better
most
folks
here
did
once
er
twicet
a
year
the
go
to
bob
office
an
set
around
an
smoke
his
pipe
sometimes
bob
would
go
to
the
farm
an
spend
an
but
not
often
ol
will
thompson
might
be
said
to
be
the
friend
the
really
hankered
fer
i
like
to
meet
west
said
louise
casting
a
shrewd
look
at
her
cousins
for
here
was
another
clue
unearthed
he
in
his
store
now
remarked
mcnutt
last
buildin
on
the
left
ye
ca
miss
it
thank
you
good
morning
sir
ca
use
any
buttermilk
er
dutch
cheese
no
thank
you
mcnutt
stared
after
them
disconsolately
these
girls
represented
so
much
money
that
ought
to
be
in
his
pockets
and
they
were
moreover
innercent
as
turtle
doves
but
he
could
think
of
no
way
to
pluck
their
golden
quills
or
even
to
arrest
their
flight
well
let
go
he
muttered
this
thing
ai
ended
yit
chapter
xiii
bob
west
hardware
dealer
a
few
steps
down
the
little
street
brought
the
girls
to
the
hardware
store
quite
the
most
imposing
building
in
town
they
crossed
the
broad
platform
on
which
stood
samples
of
heavy
farm
machinery
and
entered
a
room
where
many
articles
of
hardware
and
house
furnishings
were
neatly
and
systematically
arranged
the
place
seemed
deserted
for
at
that
time
of
day
no
country
people
were
at
millville
but
on
passing
down
the
aisle
the
visitor
approached
a
little
office
built
at
the
rear
of
the
store
behind
the
desk
bob
west
sat
upon
his
high
stool
gravely
regarding
his
unusual
customers
over
the
rims
of
his
spectacles
good
morning
said
louise
taking
the
lead
have
you
a
stew
pan
the
merchant
left
the
office
and
silently
walked
behind
the
counter
large
or
small
miss
he
then
asked
the
girls
became
interested
in
stew
pans
which
they
were
scarcely
able
to
recognize
by
their
official
name
west
offered
no
comment
as
they
made
their
selection
can
you
send
this
to
the
wegg
farm
asked
louise
opening
her
purse
to
make
payment
west
smiled
i
have
no
means
of
delivering
goods
said
he
but
if
you
can
wait
a
day
or
two
i
may
catch
some
farmer
going
that
way
who
will
consent
to
take
it
oh
did
captain
wegg
purchase
his
supplies
in
the
village
asked
the
girl
some
of
them
but
it
is
our
custom
here
to
take
goods
that
we
purchase
home
with
us
as
yet
millville
is
scarcely
large
enough
to
require
a
delivery
wagon
the
nieces
laughed
pleasantly
and
beth
said
are
you
an
old
inhabitant
mr
west
i
have
been
here
years
then
you
knew
captain
wegg
louise
ventured
very
well
the
answer
was
so
frank
and
free
from
embarrassment
that
his
questioner
hesitated
here
was
a
man
distinctly
superior
to
the
others
they
had
interviewed
a
man
of
keen
intellect
and
worldly
knowledge
who
would
be
instantly
on
his
guard
if
he
suspected
they
were
him
so
louise
with
her
usual
tact
decided
to
speak
plainly
we
have
been
much
interested
in
the
history
of
the
wegg
family
she
remarked
easily
and
perhaps
it
is
natural
for
us
to
speculate
concerning
the
characters
of
our
predecessors
it
was
so
odd
that
captain
wegg
should
build
so
good
a
house
on
such
a
poor
farm
yes
and
he
was
a
sea
captain
who
retired
far
from
the
sea
which
he
must
have
loved
to
be
sure
it
made
him
dissatisfied
they
say
as
well
as
surly
and
unsociable
but
he
stuck
it
out
even
after
his
poor
wife
died
and
until
the
day
of
the
murder
murder
in
a
tone
of
mild
surprise
was
it
not
murder
she
asked
quickly
he
gave
his
shoulders
a
quiet
shrug
the
physician
pronounced
it
heart
disease
i
believe
what
physician
eh
why
one
who
was
fishing
in
the
neighborhood
for
trout
and
staying
at
the
hotel
old
jackson
was
in
huntington
at
the
time
i
remember
the
girls
exchanged
significant
glances
and
west
noted
them
and
smiled
again
that
murder
theory
is
a
new
one
to
me
he
said
but
i
see
now
why
it
originated
the
employment
of
a
strolling
physician
would
give
color
to
the
suspicion
what
do
you
think
sir
asked
patsy
who
had
been
watching
the
expression
closely
i
what
do
i
think
why
that
captain
wegg
died
from
heart
disease
as
he
had
often
told
me
he
was
sure
to
do
in
time
then
what
made
old
thompson
go
mad
inquired
beth
the
shock
of
his
friend
sudden
death
he
had
been
mentally
unbalanced
for
some
time
previous
not
quite
mad
you
understand
but
showing
by
his
actions
at
times
that
his
brain
was
affected
can
you
explain
what
became
of
their
money
asked
louise
abruptly
west
gave
a
start
but
collected
himself
in
an
instant
and
covered
the
action
with
another
shrug
i
can
not
say
what
become
of
their
money
he
answered
it
struck
both
beth
and
louise
that
his
tone
indicated
he
would
not
rather
than
that
he
could
not
say
before
they
had
time
to
ask
another
questioned
he
continued
will
you
take
the
saucepan
with
you
then
or
shall
i
try
to
send
it
in
a
day
or
so
we
will
take
it
if
you
please
answered
louise
but
as
he
wrapped
it
into
a
neat
parcel
she
made
one
more
effort
what
sort
of
a
young
man
was
joseph
wegg
joe
a
mere
boy
untried
and
unsettled
a
bright
boy
in
his
way
and
ambitious
to
have
a
part
in
the
big
world
he
there
now
i
believe
he
spoke
with
an
air
of
relief
and
handed
louise
the
parcel
thank
you
young
ladies
pray
call
again
if
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
he
added
in
a
brisker
tone
they
had
no
recourse
but
to
walk
out
which
they
did
without
further
words
indeed
they
were
all
three
silent
until
they
had
left
the
village
far
behind
and
were
half
way
to
the
farm
then
patsy
said
inquiringly
well
girls
we
have
progressed
announced
louise
seriously
in
what
way
several
things
are
impressed
upon
my
mind
replied
the
girl
one
is
mcnutt
absurd
indignation
when
he
thought
we
hinted
that
he
was
the
murderer
what
do
you
make
of
that
queried
patsy
it
suggests
that
he
knows
something
of
the
murder
even
if
he
is
himself
wholly
innocent
his
alibi
is
another
absurdity
then
that
exonerated
old
hucks
said
patsy
relieved
oh
not
at
all
hucks
may
have
committed
the
deed
and
mcnutt
knows
about
it
or
they
might
have
been
partners
in
the
crime
what
else
have
you
learned
louise
asked
beth
that
the
man
west
knows
what
became
of
the
money
he
seems
like
a
very
respectable
man
asserted
patsy
outwardly
yes
but
i
do
like
the
cold
calculating
expression
in
his
eyes
he
is
the
rich
man
of
this
neighborhood
do
you
suppose
he
acquired
a
fortune
honestly
in
this
forsaken
district
where
everyone
else
is
poor
as
a
church
mouse
seems
to
me
said
patsy
discontentedly
that
the
plot
thickens
as
they
say
in
novels
if
we
interview
many
more
people
we
shall
find
ourselves
suspecting
an
army
not
at
all
my
dear
replied
louise
coldly
from
our
present
knowledge
the
murder
lies
between
the
unknown
avenger
and
hucks
with
the
possibility
that
mcnutt
is
implicated
this
avenger
may
be
the
stranger
who
posed
as
a
physician
and
said
captain
wegg
died
of
heart
disease
in
order
to
prevent
the
simple
people
from
suspecting
a
murder
his
fishing
was
all
a
blind
perhaps
mcnutt
was
his
accomplice
that
staring
scarecrow
would
do
anything
for
money
and
then
we
come
to
the
robbery
if
hucks
did
the
murder
he
took
the
money
and
perhaps
west
the
hardware
dealer
knows
this
or
west
may
have
arrived
at
the
house
after
the
mysterious
stranger
committed
the
deed
and
robbed
the
two
men
himself
and
perhaps
he
did
said
patsy
skeptically
do
you
know
girls
i
like
to
find
joe
wegg
he
could
put
us
right
i
sure
joe
yes
why
do
we
suspect
him
of
something
or
ethel
or
old
nora
do
be
sensible
patsy
said
beth
impatiently
but
louise
walked
on
a
way
in
silence
presently
she
remarked
i
glad
you
mentioned
joe
wegg
the
boy
gives
me
an
idea
that
may
reconcile
many
conflicting
suspicions
in
what
way
louise
i
tell
you
when
i
thought
it
out
she
replied
chapter
xiv
the
major
is
puzzled
ethel
came
frequently
to
visit
the
girls
at
the
wegg
farm
and
at
such
times
uncle
john
treated
her
with
the
same
affectionate
consideration
he
bestowed
upon
his
nieces
and
made
her
so
cordially
welcome
that
the
little
school
teacher
felt
entirely
at
her
ease
the
girls
did
not
confide
to
ethel
their
investigation
of
the
wegg
mystery
but
in
all
other
matters
gave
her
their
full
confidence
together
they
made
excursions
to
the
falls
to
the
natural
caves
on
the
rocky
hill
called
mount
parnassus
or
rowed
on
the
lake
or
walked
or
drove
as
the
mood
seized
them
but
mostly
they
loved
the
shade
of
the
pines
and
the
broad
green
beside
the
quaint
mansion
captain
wegg
had
built
and
which
now
contained
all
the
elements
of
a
modern
summer
home
once
louise
asked
ethel
casually
if
she
knew
what
great
trouble
had
come
to
hucks
and
his
wife
in
their
early
life
but
the
girl
frankly
answered
that
the
old
people
had
never
referred
to
anything
of
the
kind
in
her
presence
finally
a
telegram
announced
the
arrival
of
major
doyle
to
join
the
party
at
the
farm
patsy
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
and
drove
joe
over
to
the
junction
to
meet
her
father
on
the
arrival
of
the
morning
train
the
major
was
a
prime
favorite
with
all
the
party
and
his
coming
infused
new
life
into
the
household
he
was
the
type
of
educated
polished
irish
gentleman
it
is
always
a
delight
to
meet
and
uncle
john
beamed
upon
his
in
a
way
that
betokened
a
hearty
welcome
it
was
a
source
of
much
satisfaction
to
lug
the
major
over
the
farm
and
prove
to
him
how
wise
merrick
had
been
in
deciding
to
spend
the
summer
on
his
own
property
and
the
major
freely
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
in
error
and
the
place
was
as
charming
as
anyone
could
wish
it
was
a
great
treat
to
the
grizzled
old
warrior
to
find
himself
in
the
country
away
from
every
responsibility
of
work
and
he
promised
himself
a
fortnight
of
absolute
rest
with
the
recreation
of
beholding
his
beloved
patsy
as
often
as
he
pleased
of
course
the
girl
would
tell
her
father
about
the
wegg
mystery
for
patsy
had
a
habit
of
telling
him
everything
therefore
the
cousins
decided
to
take
the
major
freely
into
their
confidence
so
as
to
obtain
the
benefit
of
his
opinion
that
could
not
be
done
the
first
day
of
course
for
on
that
day
uncle
john
insisted
on
displaying
the
farm
and
afterward
carrying
the
major
a
willing
prisoner
to
watch
him
fish
in
the
brook
but
on
the
following
morning
the
girls
surrounded
patsy
father
and
with
solemn
faces
recounted
their
suspicions
the
important
clues
they
had
unearthed
and
their
earnest
desire
to
right
the
great
wrong
that
had
been
done
by
apprehending
the
criminal
the
major
smoked
his
after
breakfast
cigar
and
listened
attentively
the
story
told
consecutively
was
quite
impressive
in
spite
of
his
long
experience
in
buffeting
the
world
the
old
soldier
heart
was
still
as
simple
as
that
of
a
child
and
the
recital
awakened
his
sympathies
at
once
is
evident
me
children
said
he
in
his
quaint
way
that
shtumbled
on
the
inside
of
a
crime
that
does
show
on
the
outside
many
of
the
things
you
mention
are
so
plain
that
he
who
runs
may
read
but
i
remarked
that
it
just
the
things
ye
do
suspect
in
real
life
that
prove
to
be
the
most
important
that
is
true
major
commented
louise
at
first
it
was
just
to
amuse
ourselves
that
we
became
amateur
detectives
but
the
developments
are
so
startling
and
serious
that
we
now
consider
it
our
duty
to
uncover
the
whole
dreadful
crime
in
the
interests
of
justice
just
so
he
said
nodding
but
i
sure
old
hucks
is
innocent
declared
patsy
emphatically
then
he
is
asserted
the
major
for
patsy
always
right
even
when
she
wrong
i
had
me
eye
on
that
man
hucks
already
for
he
the
merriest
faced
villain
i
ever
encountered
do
you
say
he
shy
with
you
girls
he
seems
afraid
of
us
or
suspicious
and
wo
let
us
talk
to
him
answered
beth
leave
him
to
me
proposed
the
major
turning
a
stern
face
but
twinkling
eyes
upon
the
group
be
my
task
to
detect
him
leave
him
to
me
young
women
an
i
put
the
on
him
in
short
order
here
was
the
sort
of
energetic
confederate
they
had
longed
for
the
major
assurance
of
was
welcome
indeed
and
while
he
entered
heartily
into
their
campaign
he
agreed
that
no
mention
of
the
affair
ought
to
reach
uncle
john
ears
until
the
case
was
complete
and
they
could
call
upon
the
authorities
to
arrest
the
criminal
it
me
humble
opinion
he
remarked
that
the
interesting
individual
you
call
the
was
put
on
the
trail
by
someone
here
either
thomas
hucks
or
the
book
agent
or
the
respectable
hardware
man
being
invited
to
come
and
do
his
worst
he
passed
himself
as
a
docther
on
a
fishing
excursion
and
having
with
deliberate
intent
murthered
captain
wegg
got
himself
called
by
the
coroner
to
testify
that
the
victim
died
of
heart
disease
a
very
pretty
bit
of
scoundrelism
eh
me
dears
but
the
robber
who
do
you
think
he
was
asked
louise
that
i
still
to
discover
you
inform
me
that
hucks
is
eager
for
money
and
acts
like
a
miser
i
seen
the
time
i
was
eager
for
money
meself
and
there
not
a
miserly
hair
on
me
bald
head
but
exceptions
prove
the
rule
i
watch
our
smiling
thomas
and
make
a
report
later
within
half
an
hour
he
was
telling
hucks
a
funny
story
and
slapping
the
old
man
upon
the
back
as
familiarly
as
if
he
had
known
him
for
years
he
found
an
opportunity
that
same
day
to
give
thomas
a
dollar
in
return
for
a
slight
service
and
was
amazed
at
the
eagerness
with
which
the
coin
was
clutched
and
the
earnestness
of
the
thanks
expressed
it
really
did
seem
as
if
the
man
was
fond
of
money
but
when
the
major
tried
to
draw
hucks
into
speaking
of
his
past
history
and
of
captain
wegg
singular
life
and
death
the
old
fellow
became
reserved
at
once
and
evaded
the
inquiries
most
skillfully
that
night
as
the
major
strolled
in
the
orchard
to
smoke
his
last
cigar
after
all
the
others
had
retired
to
bed
he
noticed
hucks
leave
the
back
door
of
the
with
a
parcel
under
his
arm
and
pass
hurriedly
around
the
barn
after
a
little
hesitation
he
decided
to
follow
the
man
and
crept
stealthily
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
buildings
until
he
found
himself
at
the
edge
of
the
that
was
in
the
rear
of
the
outbuildings
but
there
he
paused
irresolutely
for
thomas
had
completely
disappeared
the
major
was
puzzled
but
decided
to
watch
for
the
man
return
so
he
took
a
position
where
he
could
watch
the
rear
door
of
the
house
and
smoked
patiently
for
nearly
an
hour
before
hucks
returned
and
let
himself
quietly
in
he
said
nothing
to
the
girls
next
day
of
this
mysterious
proceeding
but
on
the
following
night
again
took
his
station
in
the
orchard
to
watch
sure
enough
as
soon
as
the
house
was
quiet
the
old
servant
came
out
with
a
bundle
underneath
his
arm
but
this
time
he
led
his
blind
wife
by
the
other
hand
the
major
gave
a
low
whistle
and
threw
away
his
cigar
the
night
was
so
dark
that
he
had
little
difficulty
in
following
the
aged
pair
closely
enough
to
keep
their
shadowy
forms
in
sight
without
the
risk
of
being
discovered
they
passed
around
the
barn
and
along
a
path
that
led
through
the
raspberry
bushes
back
of
the
yard
there
were
several
acres
of
these
bushes
and
just
now
they
were
and
almost
shoulder
high
the
path
wound
this
way
and
that
and
branched
in
several
directions
twice
the
major
thought
he
had
lost
his
quarry
but
was
guided
aright
by
their
soft
footfalls
the
ground
dipped
here
and
there
and
as
they
entered
one
of
the
hollows
major
doyle
was
startled
to
observe
the
twinkle
of
a
dim
light
ahead
a
minute
later
he
saw
the
outlines
of
a
little
frame
building
and
within
this
old
hucks
and
nora
presently
disappeared
chapter
xv
the
man
in
hiding
cautiously
the
major
approached
the
cabin
which
seemed
to
have
been
built
as
a
place
for
the
berry
pickers
to
assemble
and
pack
their
fruit
it
was
constructed
of
rough
boards
and
had
a
little
window
in
the
side
nearest
the
dwelling
house
and
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
creeping
near
to
the
window
the
major
obtained
a
clear
view
of
the
interior
upon
a
dilapidated
wicker
settee
which
had
one
end
propped
with
a
box
partially
reclined
the
form
of
a
man
whose
right
arm
was
in
splints
and
supported
by
a
sling
while
his
head
was
covered
with
plasters
and
bandages
the
man
back
was
toward
the
window
but
from
his
slender
form
and
its
graceful
poise
the
major
imagined
him
young
old
nora
held
the
left
hand
of
this
mysterious
person
in
a
warm
clasp
bending
now
and
then
to
press
a
kiss
upon
it
while
hucks
busied
himself
opening
the
parcel
he
had
brought
and
arranging
various
articles
of
food
on
a
rickety
stand
at
the
head
of
the
couch
the
old
man
smile
was
more
benevolent
and
cheery
than
ever
and
his
actions
denoted
that
strange
suppressed
eagerness
the
major
had
marked
when
he
had
taken
the
money
the
three
spoke
little
and
in
tones
so
low
that
the
spy
outside
the
window
failed
to
catch
them
soon
the
injured
man
began
to
eat
feeding
himself
laboriously
with
his
left
hand
but
his
hunger
was
quickly
satisfied
and
then
he
lay
back
wearily
upon
his
pillows
while
nora
tenderly
spread
a
coverlet
over
him
after
this
the
old
couple
did
not
linger
long
hucks
poured
some
water
from
a
jug
into
a
tumbler
glanced
around
the
little
room
to
see
that
everything
was
in
order
and
then
after
he
and
nora
had
both
kissed
the
bandaged
forehead
blew
out
the
candle
and
retired
the
major
crouched
low
in
the
berry
bushes
until
the
couple
had
passed
by
then
he
rose
and
thoughtfully
followed
after
them
whatever
patsy
father
might
have
thought
of
the
wegg
farm
mystery
before
this
adventure
convinced
him
that
the
girls
were
not
altogether
foolish
in
imagining
a
romance
connected
with
the
place
and
notwithstanding
patsy
loyal
defense
of
old
hucks
he
was
evidently
tangled
up
in
the
affair
to
a
large
extent
and
could
explain
if
he
chose
much
that
was
now
puzzling
the
girl
detectives
after
careful
thought
the
major
decided
to
confide
in
uncle
john
at
this
juncture
rather
than
in
the
nieces
since
the
latest
developments
were
more
fitted
for
a
man
interference
by
good
fortune
the
girls
had
an
engagement
the
next
day
and
set
out
together
in
the
surrey
to
visit
ethel
thompson
and
lunch
with
her
in
the
rose
bower
which
was
the
pride
of
the
little
school
teacher
garden
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
the
major
hunted
up
uncle
john
and
said
come
with
me
sir
i
wo
was
the
brisk
reply
i
going
fishing
and
whoever
wishes
my
society
must
come
with
me
you
not
catch
anything
fishing
but
you
very
liable
to
catch
something
if
you
follow
my
lead
said
the
major
meaningly
what
up
gregory
i
not
sure
what
it
is
john
and
then
he
carefully
explained
his
discovery
that
an
injured
man
was
occupying
the
cabin
in
the
berry
patch
and
seemed
to
be
the
object
of
the
hucks
tender
care
it
the
secrecy
of
the
thing
that
astounds
me
most
sir
he
added
if
all
was
open
and
above
board
i
think
little
enough
of
it
uncle
john
kindly
interest
was
at
once
aroused
and
he
proposed
that
they
go
directly
to
the
cabin
and
interview
the
man
in
hiding
hucks
being
at
the
time
busy
in
the
barn
the
two
men
sauntered
into
the
berry
patch
without
being
observed
and
then
walked
briskly
along
the
winding
paths
until
they
sighted
the
building
pausing
at
the
window
they
saw
the
man
still
reclining
upon
his
cot
and
holding
in
his
left
hand
a
book
one
of
patsy
the
major
observed
which
he
was
quietly
engaged
in
reading
then
they
moved
around
to
the
door
which
uncle
john
pushed
open
without
hesitation
the
two
men
entered
and
stood
gazing
down
upon
the
strange
occupant
of
the
place
good
morning
said
merrick
while
the
major
nodded
a
greeting
the
man
half
arose
moving
stiffly
pardon
me
sirs
he
said
rather
startled
at
the
interruption
i
regret
that
i
am
physically
unable
to
receive
you
with
more
courtesy
the
major
gazed
into
the
partially
bandaged
face
with
a
glimmer
of
awakening
recognition
ha
if
i
not
mistaken
said
he
it
joseph
wegg
oh
is
it
asked
uncle
john
looking
upon
the
young
man
curiously
what
happened
to
you
joseph
just
an
automobile
accident
sir
the
steering
gear
broke
and
we
went
over
an
embankment
i
see
are
you
merrick
sir
yes
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
intruding
upon
your
premises
in
this
way
and
beg
you
to
forgive
the
seeming
impertinence
but
i
been
rather
unlucky
of
late
sir
and
without
this
refuge
i
do
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
i
will
explain
if
you
will
permit
me
uncle
john
nodded
after
i
had
squandered
the
money
you
paid
me
through
major
doyle
for
this
farm
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
protect
a
patent
i
had
secured
i
was
forced
to
become
a
chauffeur
to
earn
my
livelihood
i
understand
automobiles
you
know
and
obtained
employment
with
a
wealthy
man
who
considered
me
a
mere
part
of
his
machine
when
the
accident
occurred
through
no
fault
of
mine
i
was
fortunately
the
only
person
injured
but
my
employer
was
so
incensed
over
the
damage
to
his
automobile
that
he
never
even
sent
to
inquire
whether
i
lived
or
died
at
a
charity
hospital
they
tried
to
mend
my
breaks
and
tinker
up
my
anatomy
my
was
shattered
my
arm
broken
in
three
places
and
four
ribs
were
crashed
in
the
wounds
in
my
head
are
mere
abrasions
of
the
scalp
and
not
serious
but
it
has
taken
me
a
long
time
to
mend
and
the
crowded
stuffy
hospital
got
on
my
nerves
and
worried
me
being
penniless
and
friendless
i
wrote
to
thomas
and
asked
him
if
he
could
find
a
way
to
get
me
to
the
old
farm
for
i
never
imagined
you
would
yourself
take
possession
of
the
deserted
place
you
had
bought
thomas
and
nora
have
cared
for
me
since
i
was
born
you
know
and
the
old
man
was
greatly
distressed
by
the
knowledge
of
my
sad
condition
he
did
not
tell
me
you
were
here
for
fear
i
would
hesitate
to
come
but
he
sent
me
the
money
you
had
given
him
and
nora
for
wages
together
with
all
that
the
young
ladies
had
kindly
given
him
i
was
thus
enabled
to
leave
the
hospital
which
i
had
come
to
detest
and
journey
to
my
old
home
i
arrived
at
the
junction
on
a
night
train
and
thomas
met
me
with
your
surrey
drove
me
here
under
cover
of
darkness
and
concealed
me
in
this
place
hoping
you
would
not
discover
me
i
regret
that
i
was
thus
foisted
upon
you
believe
me
sir
but
being
here
i
have
no
means
of
getting
away
again
thomas
hucks
has
had
little
worldly
experience
and
can
not
realize
the
full
extent
of
the
imposition
he
has
practiced
he
feeds
me
from
your
table
and
is
hoarding
up
his
money
for
me
against
the
time
i
shall
have
recovered
sufficiently
to
leave
i
think
that
is
the
full
explanation
mr
merrick
again
uncle
john
nodded
how
are
you
he
asked
doing
finely
sir
i
can
walk
a
little
and
my
appetite
is
improving
the
doctors
said
my
shoulder
would
never
be
very
strong
again
but
beginning
to
hope
they
were
mistaken
my
ribs
seem
all
right
and
in
another
ten
days
i
shall
remove
the
splints
from
my
arm
you
have
no
medical
attendance
not
since
i
left
the
hospital
but
i
imagine
this
pure
bracing
air
is
better
for
me
than
a
dozen
doctors
was
the
cheerful
reply
and
what
are
your
future
plans
the
young
man
smiled
he
was
little
more
than
a
boy
but
his
questioner
noticed
that
he
had
a
fine
manly
face
and
his
eye
was
clear
and
steadfast
nothing
further
than
to
get
to
work
again
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
undertake
it
he
said
uncle
john
looked
thoughtfully
and
drummed
with
his
finger
upon
the
little
table
joseph
he
remarked
presently
i
bought
this
farm
at
a
price
altogether
too
small
considering
its
value
the
boy
flushed
please
do
not
say
that
he
exclaimed
hastily
i
am
well
aware
that
i
virtually
robbed
you
and
my
only
excuse
is
that
i
believed
i
would
win
my
fight
and
be
able
to
redeem
the
place
but
that
is
over
now
and
you
must
not
think
that
because
i
am
ill
and
helpless
i
am
an
object
of
charity
phoo
said
the
little
man
are
you
accepting
charity
from
old
hucks
but
he
stands
as
a
second
father
to
me
he
is
an
old
retainer
of
my
family
and
one
of
my
ambitions
is
to
secure
a
home
for
him
and
nora
in
their
old
age
no
i
do
not
feel
at
all
embarrassed
in
accepting
money
or
assistance
from
thomas
young
man
said
uncle
john
sternly
one
of
the
follies
of
youth
is
the
idea
of
being
independent
of
the
of
your
every
person
who
lives
is
dependent
on
some
other
person
for
something
or
other
and
i
not
allow
you
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
by
refusing
to
let
me
take
you
in
hand
your
brain
is
affected
it
is
not
you
are
mentally
unbalanced
and
need
a
guardian
that
me
you
are
helpless
and
can
not
resist
so
you
my
prisoner
dare
to
defy
me
dare
to
oppose
my
wishes
in
any
way
and
i
have
you
put
in
a
and
confined
in
a
padded
cell
understand
me
sir
joseph
wegg
looked
into
the
little
man
round
face
until
the
tears
filled
his
own
eyes
and
blurred
his
vision
wo
you
protect
me
major
doyle
he
asked
weakly
not
i
said
the
major
stoutly
this
of
mine
who
connected
himself
with
me
without
asking
permission
is
a
perfect
demon
when
and
i
not
meddle
with
any
opposition
to
his
desires
if
you
value
your
life
and
happiness
joseph
wegg
you
accept
merrick
as
a
guardian
until
he
resigns
of
his
own
accord
and
then
likely
you
wish
he
had
i
do
deserve
began
the
young
man
brokenly
but
uncle
john
quickly
interrupted
him
no
one
deserves
anything
said
he
but
everyone
gets
something
or
other
nevertheless
in
this
vale
of
tears
if
you
kindly
remember
that
you
no
right
to
express
an
opinion
in
the
presence
of
your
guardian
we
get
along
better
together
now
then
you
going
to
leave
here
because
the
place
is
not
comfortable
my
guests
fill
every
room
in
my
house
so
you
ca
go
there
but
the
hotel
in
millville
is
a
place
and
i
noticed
some
windows
that
indicate
pleasant
and
sunny
rooms

and

hucks

that
groaning
balky
daniel

the
ancient
buggy
and
then
to
drive
this
young
man
over
to
the
hotel
we

the
major
started
at
once
and
uncle
john
continued
i
do
know
whether
this
arrangement
suits
you
or
not
joseph
but
it
suits
me
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
none
of
your
business
feel
able
to
take
a
ride
the
boy
smiled
gratefully
yes
indeed
merrick
said
he
and
was
shrewd
enough
not
to
venture
a
word
of
thanks

still
smiling
but
dreadfully
nervous
over
the
discovery
of
joe
and
merrick
sudden
activity
in

speedily
harnessed
daniel
and
induced
the
reluctant
steed
to
amble
down
the
path
to
the
cabin
leaning
on
uncle
john
arm
the
invalid
walked
to
the
buggy
and
was
assisted
to
mount
to
the
seat
beside
thomas
then
away
they
started
and
although
dan
obeyed
hucks
more
willingly
than
any
other
driver
the
major
and
uncle
john
walked
and
reached
the
hotel
a
good
fifteen
minutes
in
advance
of
the
equipage
the
millville
hotel
depended
almost
entirely
for
patronage
upon
the
commercial
travelers
who
visited
the
place
periodically
to
sell
goods
to
the
merchants
and
these
did
not
come
too
often
because
trade
was
never
very
energetic
and
orders
never
very
large
bob

boarded
at
the
hotel
and
so
did
ned
long
a
farm
hand
who
did
sundry
odd
jobs
for
anyone
who
needed
him
and
helped
pay
his
keep
by
working
for
kebble
when
not
otherwise
engaged
kebble
was
the
landlady
and
a
famous
cook
kate
kebble
a
slatternly
girl
of
sixteen
helped
her
mother
do
the
work
and
waited
on
the
table
chet
kebble
the
landlord
was
a
silent
old
man
with
whiskers
and
one
stray
eye
which
being
constructed
of
glass
usually
assumed
a
slanting
gaze
and
refused
to
follow
the
direction
of
its
fellow
chet
minded
the
which
was
mostly
patronized
saturday
nights
and
did
a
meager
business
in
fire
insurance
but
he
was
so
eternal
lazy
an
shifless
as
kebble
sharply
asserted
that
he
was
considered
more
a
of
the
establishment
than
its
recognized
head
the
little
rooms
of
the
hotel
were
plainly
furnished
but
maintained
with
exceptional
neatness
the
one
in
the
east
corner
of
the
second
floor
met
with
the
approval
of
uncle
john
and
the
major
and
was
promptly
engaged
it
was
cheerful
and
sunny
with
outlooks
on
the
lake
and
the
village
and
contained
a
lounge
as
well
as
the
bed
when
the
invalid
arrived
he
was
assisted
to
this
apartment
and
installed
as
its
permanent
occupant
any
baggage
asked
merrick
there
a
small
trunk
lying
at
the
junction
said
joe
but
it
contains
little
of
importance
well
make
yourself
at
home
my
boy
and
get
well
at
your
leisure
remarked
uncle
john
kebble
has
promised
to
look
after
you
and
the
major
and
i
will
stop
in
now
and
then
and
see
how
you
progress
then
he
went
out
engaged
nick
thorne
to
go
to
the
junction
for
the
boy
trunk
and
selected
several
things
at
the
store
that
he
thought
might
be
useful
to
the
invalid
afterward
he
marched
home
again
beside
the
major
feeling
very
well
pleased
with
his
morning
work
when
the
girls
reached
home
late
in
the
afternoon
they
were
thrown
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
by
the
news
briefly
related
by
their
uncle
that
joseph
wegg
had
returned
to
millville
considerably
smashed
by
an
automobile
accident
and
was
now
stopping
at
the
village
hotel
for
repairs
they
refrained
from
making
remarks
upon
the
incident
until
they
were
alone
when
the
secret
council
of
three
decided
to
make
joe
acquaintance
as
soon
as
possible
to
discover
what
light
the
young
man
might
be
able
to
throw
upon
the
great
mystery
do
you
know
girls
said
louise
impressively
it
almost
seems
as
if
fate
had
sent
joe
wegg
here
to
be
an
instrument
in
the
detection
of
the
murderer
and
robber
of
his
poor
father
if
joe
knew
about
it
why
did
he
track
the
villain
down
himself
inquired
patsy
perhaps
he
has
suspected
the
truth
said
beth
often
those
who
are
closely
concerned
with
such
tragedies
do
not
observe
the
evidences
of
crime
as
clearly
as
outsiders
where
did
you
get
that
information
demanded
patsy
from
one
of
anna
doyle
oppenheim
detective
stories
answered
beth
seriously
i
been
reading
up
on
such
things
lately
detective
stories
said
louise
reflectively
are
only
useful
in
teaching
us
to
observe
the
evidences
of
crime
this
case
for
example
is
so
intricate
and
unusual
that
only
by
careful
thought
and
following
each
thread
of
evidence
to
its
end
can
we
hope
to
bring
the
criminal
to
justice
that
seems
to
me
conceited
observed
miss
doyle
composedly
detective
stories
do
have
to
stick
to
facts
or
rather
they
can
make
the
facts
to
be
whatever
they
please
so
i
do
consider
them
as
useful
as
they
are
ornamental
and
this
is
a
novel
girls
mostly
suspicion
and
slander
you
do
seem
able
to
be
in
earnest
about
anything
objected
beth
turning
a
little
red
but
i
try
to
be
said
patricia
we
are
straying
from
the
subject
now
under
discussion
remarked
louise
i
must
say
that
i
feel
greatly
encouraged
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
wegg
boy
he
may
know
something
of
his
father
former
associates
that
will
enable
us
to
determine
the
object
of
the
murder
and
who
accomplished
it
captain
wegg
was
killed
over
three
years
ago
suggested
miss
doyle
recovering
easily
from
her
rebuff
by
this
time
the
murderer
may
have
died
or
moved
to
madagascar
he
is
probably
living
within
our
reach
never
suspecting
that
justice
is
about
to
overtake
him
asserted
louise
we
must
certainly
go
to
call
upon
this
wegg
boy
and
draw
from
him
such
information
as
we
can
i
am
almost
certain
that
the
end
is
in
sight
we
have
any
positive
proof
at
all
yet
observed
patsy
musingly
we
have
plenty
of
circumstantial
evidence
returned
beth
there
is
only
one
way
to
explain
the
facts
we
have
already
learned
and
the
theory
we
have
built
up
will
be
a
hard
one
to
overthrow
the
flight
of
captain
wegg
to
this
place
his
unhappy
wife
the
great
trouble
that
old
nora
has
hinted
at
the
the
great
trouble
ought
to
come
first
declared
louise
it
is
the
foundation
upon
which
rest
all
the
mysterious
occurrences
following
and
once
we
have
learned
what
the
great
trouble
was
the
rest
will
be
plain
sailing
i
agree
with
you
said
beth
and
perhaps
joseph
wegg
will
be
able
to
tell
us
what
the
trouble
was
that
ruined
the
lives
of
his
parents
as
well
as
of
old
hucks
and
his
wife
and
caused
them
all
to
flee
here
to
hide
themselves
it
was
not
until
the
following
morning
that
the
major
found
an
opportunity
to
give
the
confederates
a
solemn
wink
to
indicate
he
had
news
to
confide
to
them
they
gathered
eagerly
on
the
lawn
and
he
told
them
of
the
finding
of
joe
wegg
in
the
isolated
cabin
and
how
old
thomas
and
nora
loving
the
boy
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
their
own
child
had
sacrificed
everything
to
assist
him
in
his
extremity
so
ye
see
my
avenging
angels
that
ye
run
off
the
track
in
the
hucks
matter
he
added
smiling
at
their
bewildered
faces
patsy
was
delighted
at
this
refutation
of
the
slanderous
suspicions
that
thomas
was
a
miser
and
his
smiling
face
a
mask
to
hide
his
innate
villainy
the
other
girls
were
somewhat
depressed
by
the
overthrow
of
one
of
their
pet
theories
and
reluctantly
admitted
that
if
hucks
had
been
the
robber
of
his
master
and
old
will
thompson
he
would
not
have
striven
so
eagerly
to
get
enough
money
to
send
to
joe
wegg
but
they
pointed
out
that
the
old
servant
was
surely
hiding
his
knowledge
of
captain
wegg
past
and
could
not
be
induced
to
clear
up
that
portion
of
the
mystery
which
he
had
full
knowledge
of
so
while
he
might
be
personally
innocent
of
the
murder
or
robbery
both
beth
and
louise
were
confident
he
was
attempting
to
shield
the
real
criminal
but
who
is
the
real
criminal
inquired
patsy
let
us
consider
answer
louise
with
the
calm
businesslike
tone
she
adopted
in
these
matters
there
is
the
strolling
physician
whom
we
call
the
unknown
avenger
for
one
a
second
suspect
is
the
man
mcnutt
whose
nature
is
so
perverted
that
he
would
stick
at
nothing
the
third
suspicious
individual
is
bob
west
oh
louise
west
is
so
respectable
and
so
prosperous
exclaimed
patsy
it
a
far
jump
from
mcnutt
to
west
added
beth
leaving
out
hucks
continued
louise
her
eyes
sparkling
with
the
delightful
excitement
of
maintaining
her
theories
against
odds
here
are
three
people
who
might
have
been
concerned
in
the
robbery
or
murder
two
of
them
are
under
our
hands
perhaps
joseph
wegg
may
be
able
to
tell
us
where
to
find
the
third
they
pleaded
so
hard
with
the
major
to
take
them
to
call
upon
the
injured
youth
that
very
day
that
the
old
gentleman
consented
and
without
telling
uncle
john
of
their
plans
they
drove
to
millville
in
the
afternoon
and
alighted
at
the
hotel
the
major
went
first
to
the
boy
room
and
found
him
not
only
very
comfortable
but
bright
and
cheerful
in
mood
at
this
rate
sir
he
said
smilingly
i
shall
be
able
to
discharge
my
guardian
in
quick
time
i
twice
the
man
i
was
yesterday
i
brought
some
young
ladies
to
call
upon
you
announced
the
major
will
you
see
them
joe
flushed
at
first
remembering
his
plastered
skull
and
maimed
condition
but
he
could
not
well
refuse
to
receive
his
callers
whom
he
guessed
to
be
the
three
girls
old
hucks
had
praised
to
him
so
highly
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
sir
he
replied
an
invalid
is
usually
of
interest
to
women
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
three
young
ladies
were
at
once
attracted
by
the
boy
who
reclined
upon
his
couch
before
the
windows
they
thought
of
ethel
too
and
did
not
marvel
that
the
girl
grieved
over
the
loss
of
this
friend
of
her
childhood
joe
had
to
recount
the
adventure
with
the
automobile
which
led
to
his
injuries
and
afterward
give
an
account
of
his
life
at
the
hospital
that
led
naturally
to
the
timely
assistance
rendered
him
by
the
faithful
thomas
so
that
louise
was
able
to
broach
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
we
have
been
greatly
interested
in
your
old
servants
whom
we
acquired
with
the
farm
it
seems
and
all
of
us
admire
their
simplicity
and
sincerity
she
began
nora
is
a
dear
added
beth
and
thomas
is
so
cheerful
that
his
smile
is
enough
to
vanquish
any
attack
of
the
blues
said
patsy
the
hucks
are
the
right
sort
and
no
mistake
declared
the
major
taking
his
cue
from
the
others
this
praise
evidently
delighted
the
boy
they
could
have
found
no
more
direct
way
to
win
his
confidence
nora
was
my
mother
maid
from
the
time
she
was
a
mere
girl
said
he
and
thomas
sailed
with
my
father
many
years
before
i
was
born
they
were
a
little
surprised
to
hear
him
speak
so
frankly
but
louise
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
opening
afforded
her
nora
has
told
us
that
some
great
trouble
came
to
them
years
ago
a
trouble
that
also
affected
your
own
parents
but
they
do
not
wish
to
talk
about
it
to
us
his
face
clouded
no
indeed
said
he
their
loving
old
hearts
have
never
recovered
from
the
blow
would
you
like
to
know
their
history
it
is
a
sad
story
and
pitiful
but
i
am
sure
you
would
understand
and
appreciate
my
old
friends
better
after
hearing
it
their
hearts
fairly
jumped
with
joy
would
they
like
to
hear
the
story
was
it
not
this
very
clue
which
they
had
been
blindly
groping
for
to
enable
them
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
wegg
crime
the
boy
marked
their
interest
and
began
his
story
at
once
while
the
hearts
of
the
three
girls
at
last
at
last
chapter
xvii
joe
tells
of
the
great
trouble
as
a
young
man
my
father
was
a
successful
sea
captain
said
the
boy
and
before
he
was
thirty
owned
a
considerable
interest
in
the
ship
he
sailed
thomas
hucks
was
his
boatswain
an
honest
and
able
seaman
in
whom
my
father
became
much
interested
hucks
was
married
and
his
wife
was
an
attendant
in
the
employ
of
hugh
carter
a
wealthy
ship
chandler
of
edmunton
the
port
from
which
my
fathers
ship
sailed
thomas
had
some
difficulty
in
enjoying
his
wife
society
when
on
shore
because
old
carter
did
not
want
him
hanging
around
the
house
so
captain
wegg
offered
to
intercede
for
him
carter
was
a
gruff
and
disagreeable
man
and
although
my
father
had
been
a
good
customer
he
refused
his
request
and
threatened
to
discharge
nora
which
he
did
this
made
captain
wegg
angry
and
he
called
upon
mary
carter
whose
especial
attendant
nora
had
been
to
ask
her
to
take
the
girl
back
mary
was
a
mild
young
lady
who
dared
not
oppose
her
father
but
the
result
of
the
interview
was
that
the
sea
captain
and
mary
carter
fell
mutually
in
love
during
the
next
two
or
three
years
whenever
the
ship
was
in
port
the
lovers
frequently
met
by
stealth
at
the
cottage
of
hucks
a
little
place
thomas
had
rented
here
my
father
and
mother
were
finally
married
meantime
nora
had
a
son
a
fine
young
chap
i
heard
and
presently
my
mother
who
had
a
little
fortune
of
her
own
plucked
up
enough
courage
to
leave
her
father
roof
and
took
up
her
abode
in
a
pretty
villa
on
the
edge
of
a
bluff
overlooking
the
sea
nora
came
to
live
with
her
again
bringing
her
child
and
the
two
women
were
company
for
one
another
while
their
husbands
were
at
sea
in
course
of
time
my
mother
had
two
children
a
girl
and
a
boy
and
because
the
hucks
boy
was
considerably
older
than
they
he
took
care
of
them
to
a
great
extent
and
the
three
youngsters
were
always
together
their
favorite
playground
was
on
the
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
and
before
young
tom
was
ten
years
old
he
could
swim
like
a
duck
and
manage
a
boat
remarkably
well
the
wegg
children
having
something
of
their
mother
timid
nature
perhaps
were
not
so
adventurous
but
they
seldom
hesitated
to
go
wherever
tom
led
them
one
day
while
my
mother
was
slightly
ill
and
nora
was
attending
to
her
tom
disobeyed
the
commands
that
had
been
given
him
and
took
his
younger
companions
out
on
the
ocean
for
a
ride
in
his
boat
no
one
knows
how
far
they
went
or
exactly
what
happened
to
them
but
a
sudden
squall
sprang
up
and
the
children
being
missed
my
mother
insisted
ill
as
she
was
in
running
down
to
the
shore
to
search
for
her
darlings
braving
the
wind
and
drenched
by
rain
the
two
mothers
stood
side
by
side
peering
into
the
gloom
while
brave
men
dared
the
waves
to
search
for
the
missing
ones
the
body
of
the
girl
was
first
washed
ashore
and
my
mother
rocked
the
lifeless
form
in
her
arms
until
her
dead
son
was
laid
beside
her
then
young
tom
body
was
recovered
and
the
horror
was
complete
when
my
father
arrived
three
days
later
he
not
only
found
himself
bereaved
of
the
two
children
he
had
loved
so
tenderly
but
his
young
wife
was
raving
with
brain
fever
and
likely
to
follow
her
babies
to
the
grave
during
that
terrible
time
nora
who
could
not
forget
that
it
was
her
own
adventurous
son
who
had
led
all
three
children
to
their
death
went
suddenly
blind
from
grief
the
doctors
said
my
father
pulled
his
wife
back
to
life
by
dint
of
careful
nursing
but
whenever
she
looked
at
the
sea
she
would
scream
with
horror
so
it
became
necessary
to
take
her
where
the
cruel
sound
of
the
breakers
could
never
reach
her
ears
i
think
the
grief
of
thomas
and
nora
was
scarcely
less
than
that
of
my
own
parents
and
both
men
had
suffered
so
severely
that
they
were
willing
to
abandon
the
sea
and
devote
their
lives
to
comforting
their
poor
wives
captain
wegg
sold
all
his
interests
and
his
wife
villa
and
brought
the
money
here
where
he
established
a
home
amid
entirely
different
surroundings
he
was
devoted
to
my
mother
i
have
heard
and
when
she
died
soon
after
my
birth
the
captain
seemed
to
lose
all
further
interest
in
life
and
grew
morose
and
unsociable
with
all
his
that
young
ladies
is
the
story
of
what
thomas
and
nora
call
their
trouble
and
i
think
it
is
rightly
named
because
it
destroyed
the
happiness
of
two
families
i
was
born
long
after
the
tragedy
but
its
shadow
has
saddened
even
my
own
life
when
the
boy
had
finished
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
his
auditors
were
much
affected
by
the
sad
tale
patsy
was
positively
weeping
and
the
major
blew
his
nose
vigorously
and
advised
his
daughter
to
dry
up
an
be
sinsible
beth
great
eyes
stared
compassionately
at
the
young
fellow
and
even
louise
for
the
moment
allowed
her
sympathy
to
outweigh
the
disappointment
and
chagrin
of
seeing
her
carefully
constructed
theory
of
crime
topple
over
like
the
house
of
cards
it
was
there
was
now
no
avenger
to
be
discovered
because
there
had
been
nothing
to
avenge
the
simple
yet
pathetic
story
accounted
for
all
the
mystery
that
in
her
imagination
enveloped
the
life
and
death
of
captain
wegg
but
stay
how
did
your
father
die
she
asked
softly
through
a
heart
trouble
from
which
he
had
suffered
for
years
and
which
had
obliged
him
to
lead
a
very
quiet
life
was
the
reply
that
was
one
of
the
things
which
after
my
mother
death
helped
to
sour
his
disposition
he
could
not
return
to
the
sea
again
because
he
was
told
that
any
sudden
excitement
was
likely
to
carry
him
off
and
indeed
that
was
exactly
what
happened
how
is
that
sir
asked
the
major
it
is
more
difficult
to
explain
than
the
first
of
the
story
replied
the
boy
thoughtfully
gazing
through
the
window
perhaps
because
i
do
not
understand
it
so
well
our
simple
life
here
never
made
much
of
an
inroad
into
my
father
modest
fortune
for
our
wants
were
few
but
captain
wegg
was
a
poor
man
of
business
having
been
a
sailor
during
all
his
active
life
his
only
intimate
friend
an
honest
bluff
old
farmer
named
will
thompson
was
as
childish
regarding
money
matters
as
my
father
but
had
a
passion
for
investments
and
induced
my
father
to
join
some
of
his
schemes
thompson
mind
was
somewhat
erratic
at
times
but
keen
in
some
ways
nevertheless
fearing
to
trust
his
judgment
entirely
my
father
chose
to
lean
upon
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
a
shrewd
merchant
of
millville
named
robert
west
the
hardware
dealer
asked
louise
impulsively
yes
i
see
you
have
met
him
replied
joseph
wegg
with
a
smile
at
the
eager
pretty
face
of
his
visitor
bob
west
was
a
prosperous
man
and
very
careful
about
his
own
investments
so
he
became
a
sort
of
business
adviser
to
my
father
and
thompson
and
arbitrated
any
differences
of
opinion
they
might
have
for
several
years
due
to
west
good
offices
the
two
oddly
mated
friends
were
successful
in
their
ventures
and
added
to
their
capital
finally
west
came
to
them
himself
with
a
proposition
he
had
discovered
a
chance
to
make
a
good
deal
of
money
by
purchasing
an
extensive
pine
forest
near
almaquo
just
across
the
border
in
canada
west
had
taken
an
option
on
the
property
when
he
found
by
accident
that
the
lumber
company
was
anxious
to
get
hold
of
the
tract
and
cut
the
timber
on
a
royalty
that
would
enable
the
owners
to
double
their
investment
howld
on
a
jiffy
cried
the
major
excitedly
did
i
understand
you
to
say
the
lumber
company
that
was
the
firm
sir
i
used
to
overhear
my
father
and
will
thompson
talking
about
this
matter
but
i
must
admit
my
knowledge
is
somewhat
imperfect
because
i
never
was
allowed
to
ask
questions
i
remember
learning
the
fact
that
west
had
not
enough
money
to
swing
his
option
and
so
urged
his
friends
to
join
him
relying
upon
west
judgment
they
put
all
their
little
fortunes
into
the
deal
although
thompson
grumbled
at
doing
so
because
he
claimed
he
had
another
investment
that
was
better
and
this
matter
of
west
would
prevent
him
from
undertaking
it
the
almaquo
tract
was
purchased
and
a
contract
made
with
the
lumber
company
to
cut
the
timber
and
pay
them
a
royalty
of
so
much
a
thousand
feet
yet
although
the
prospects
for
profit
seemed
so
good
i
know
that
for
some
reason
both
my
father
and
thompson
were
dissatisfied
with
the
deal
and
this
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
every
penny
of
their
money
was
tied
up
in
one
investment
west
used
to
come
to
the
house
and
argue
with
them
that
the
property
was
safe
as
the
bank
of
england
and
then
old
will
would
tell
him
how
much
more
he
could
have
made
out
of
another
investment
he
had
in
mind
so
that
a
coolness
grew
up
between
west
and
the
others
that
gradually
led
to
their
estrangement
i
can
well
remember
the
evening
when
bob
west
pretty
financial
bubble
burst
thompson
and
my
father
were
sitting
together
in
the
right
wing
smoking
solemnly
and
exchanging
a
few
words
as
was
their
custom
when
west
arrived
with
a
while
face
and
a
newspaper
under
his
arm
i
was
in
the
next
room
lying
half
asleep
upon
the
sofa
when
i
heard
west
cry
despairingly
ruined
ruined
i
crept
to
the
door
then
and
looked
in
both
men
were
staring
and
at
west
who
was
explaining
in
a
trembling
voice
that
a
terrible
forest
fire
had
swept
through
the
almaquo
section
and
wiped
out
every
tree
upon
the
property
he
had
the
full
account
in
the
newspaper
and
had
begun
reading
it
when
my
father
uttered
a
low
moan
and
tumbled
off
his
chair
to
the
floor
will
thompson
gave
a
wild
cry
and
knelt
beside
him
god
he
dead
bob
he
dead
and
you
killed
him
with
your
good
news
he
screamed
already
raving
and
then
old
hucks
ran
in
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
madman
from
throttling
west
for
his
fingers
were
even
then
twined
around
bob
throat
there
was
a
desperate
struggle
and
i
remember
that
scared
as
i
was
i
joined
thomas
in
trying
to
pull
thompson
off
his
prey
but
suddenly
old
will
threw
up
his
arms
and
toppled
backward
still
raving
like
a
demon
but
unable
to
move
his
body
from
the
waist
downward
west
helped
us
to
put
him
in
bed
and
said
he
was
paralyzed
which
afterward
proved
to
be
the
truth
also
his
mind
was
forever
gone
and
i
think
it
was
father
death
that
did
that
rather
than
the
loss
of
his
money
they
were
all
staring
at
the
speaker
most
of
the
mystery
was
being
cleared
away
indeed
there
was
now
little
of
mystery
remaining
at
all
west
hurried
after
a
doctor
continued
joe
who
was
almost
as
much
absorbed
in
his
story
as
were
his
listeners
and
spoke
in
a
reflective
musing
way
and
he
succeeded
in
finding
one
who
was
stopping
for
a
few
days
at
the
hotel
poor
bob
was
very
kind
to
us
in
our
trouble
and
i
never
heard
him
mention
a
word
about
his
own
losses
which
must
have
been
severe
after
the
funeral
was
over
and
i
found
i
had
nothing
to
inherit
but
the
farm
i
decided
to
go
to
the
city
and
make
my
way
there
as
i
had
long
wished
to
do
west
gave
me
a
little
money
to
start
me
on
my
way
and
the
rest
of
my
story
is
not
very
interesting
to
anybody
major
doyle
knows
something
of
it
after
the
time
when
i
got
through
my
technical
school
by
working
as
a
servant
to
pay
for
my
instruction
a
failure
in
life
so
far
young
ladies
but
if
you
not
bear
that
against
me
i
try
to
do
better
in
the
future
good
cried
the
major
approvingly
as
he
took
the
boy
left
hand
in
both
his
own
and
pressed
it
you
developing
the
right
spirit
joseph
me
lad
and
we
think
no
more
about
the
sadness
of
the
past
but
look
forward
to
the
joy
of
your
future
of
course
said
patsy
nodding
gravely
joe
wegg
is
bound
to
be
a
great
man
some
day
chapter
xviii
the
locked
cupboard
louise
and
beth
returned
to
the
farm
in
dismal
silence
every
prop
had
been
knocked
from
beneath
their
carefully
erected
temple
of
mystery
now
there
was
no
mystery
at
all
in
a
few
words
joe
wegg
had
explained
everything
and
explained
all
so
simply
and
naturally
that
louise
felt
like
sobbing
with
the
bitterness
of
a
child
deprived
of
its
pet
plaything
the
band
of
girl
detectives
had
been
put
out
of
business
as
patsy
said
because
the
plain
fact
had
developed
that
there
was
nothing
to
detect
and
never
had
been
there
had
been
no
murder
no
robbery
no
flight
or
hiding
on
the
part
of
the
weggs
to
escape
an
injured
enemy
nothing
even
mysterious
in
the
light
of
the
story
they
had
just
heard
it
was
dreadfully
humiliating
and
thoroughly
disheartening
after
all
their
earnest
endeavor
to
investigate
a
crime
that
had
never
been
committed
uncle
john
rallied
his
nieces
on
their
somber
faces
at
the
dinner
table
and
was
greatly
amused
when
the
major
despite
the
appealing
looks
directed
at
him
gave
merrick
a
brief
resume
of
the
developments
well
i
declare
said
the
little
man
merrily
did
i
warn
you
louise
not
to
try
to
saddle
a
murder
onto
my
new
farm
how
you
foolish
girls
could
ever
have
imagined
such
a
carnival
of
crime
in
connection
with
the
weggs
is
certainly
remarkable
i
do
know
about
that
sir
returned
the
major
seriously
i
was
meself
inoculated
with
the
idea
and
for
a
while
i
considered
meself
and
the
girls
the
equals
of
all
the
pinkertons
in
the
country
and
when
ye
come
to
think
of
it
the
history
of
poor
captain
wegg
and
his
wife
and
of
nora
and
thomas
as
well
is
out
of
the
ordinary
entirely
and
without
the
explanation
contained
all
the
elements
of
a
mystery
how
did
you
say
the
weggs
lost
their
money
inquired
uncle
john
turning
the
subject
because
he
saw
that
it
embarrassed
his
nieces
why
forest
fires
at
almaquo
in
canada
burned
down
the
timber
they
had
bought
replied
the
major
and
by
the
way
john
interested
in
that
matter
yourself
for
the
lumber
company
in
which
you
own
a
lot
of
stock
had
contracted
to
cut
the
timber
on
a
royalty
how
long
ago
three
years
sir
well
we
been
cutting
timber
at
almaquo
ever
since
said
merrick
louise
dropped
her
fork
with
a
clatter
disclosing
in
this
young
lady
an
unusual
degree
of
excitement
then
there
something
to
detect
she
cried
eh
what
do
you
mean
inquired
her
uncle
if
you
been
cutting
timber
at
almaquo
for
three
years
the
trees
could
have
burned
down
louise
declared
triumphantly
that
is
evident
said
the
major
dryly
i
had
it
in
me
mind
louise
to
take
that
matter
up
for
investigation
but
you
are
so
imbued
with
the
detective
spirit
that
there
no
heading
you
off
a
trail
before
the
dessert
comes
on
announced
uncle
john
impressively
i
want
to
make
a
statement
you
folks
have
tried
your
hands
at
the
detective
business
and
made
a
mess
of
it
now
it
my
turn
i
be
a
detective
for
three
days
and
if
i
do
succeed
better
than
you
did
young
women
we
mingle
our
tears
in
all
humility
eh
major
put
me
in
the
bunch
sir
said
the
old
soldier
i
was
as
bad
as
any
of
them
and
go
ahead
in
your
own
way
if
ye
like
it
me
humble
opinion
john
that
you
no
sherlock
holmes
but
ye
wo
believe
it
ye
satisfy
yourself
of
the
fact
next
morning
the
loungers
around
sam
cotting
store
were
thrown
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
when
the
nabob
came
over
from
the
wegg
farm
and
held
the
telephone
for
more
than
an
hour
while
he
talked
with
people
in
new
york
the
natives
knew
that
their
telephone
which
was
built
into
a
small
booth
at
one
end
of
the
store
next
the
boxes
was
part
of
a
system
that
made
it
possible
for
one
to
talk
to
those
in
far
away
cities
often
the
country
people
would
eye
the
instrument
with
awe
and
whisper
to
each
other
of
its
mighty
powers
but
no
one
had
ever
before
used
it
to
telephone
farther
than

and
then
only
on
rare
occasions
it
cost
a
heap
o
money
sam
said
mcnutt
uneasily
while
uncle
john
was
engaged
in
his
remarkable
conversation
they
could
see
him
in
the
booth
through
the
little
window
it
will
mac
was
the
solemn
reply
but
the
fool
nabob
may
as
well
spend
it
thet
way
as
any
other
it
mighty
little
of
his
capital
er
surplus
gits
inter
thet
a
fact
uncle
john
came
from
the
booth
perspiring
but
smiling
and
happy
he
walked
across
the
street
to
see
joe
wegg
and
found
the
youth
seated
in
a
and
looking
quite
convalescent
but
he
had
company
in
a
chair
opposite
sat
a
man
neatly
dressed
with
a
thin
intelligent
face
a
stubby
gray
moustache
and
shrewd
eyes
covered
by
spectacles
good
morning
merrick
said
joe
cheerily
this
is
robert
west
one
of
the
millville
merchants
who
is
an
old
friend
of
our
family
i
heard
of
west
and
i
glad
to
meet
him
replied
uncle
john
looking
at
the
other
calmly
but
not
offering
to
shake
hands
i
believe
you
are
the
president
and
treasurer
of
the
almaquo
timber
tract
company
are
you
not
joseph
looked
startled
and
then
embarrassed
as
he
overheard
the
question
west
without
altering
his
position
of
careless
ease
glanced
over
the
rims
of
his
glasses
at
the
speaker
i
am
the
humble
individual
you
refer
to
merrick
he
said
briefly
but
the
almaquo
timber
all
burned
down
remarked
joe
thinking
an
explanation
was
needed
that
a
mistake
returned
merrick
my
company
has
paid
west
as
treasurer
of
his
company
more
than
fifty
thousand
dollars
during
the
last
three
years
west
jaw
dropped
your
company
he
exclaimed
as
if
mystified
yes
i
own
the
controlling
interest
in
the
lumber
company
which
has
the
contract
to
cut
your
timber
answered
merrick
the
hardware
dealer
slowly
arose
and
glanced
at
his
watch
i
must
get
back
to
my
store
he
said
you
are
somewhat
in
error
about
your
company
merrick
but
i
suppose
your
interests
are
so
large
and
varied
that
you
can
not
well
keep
track
of
them
good
morning
sir
see
you
again
soon
joe
glad
you
improving
so
rapidly
let
me
know
if
i
can
do
anything
to
help
you
with
these
quiet
words
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
and
when
he
had
gone
joe
said
in
a
deprecating
tone
poor
bob
must
be
very
unhappy
about
having
lost
my
father
money
in
that
speculation
for
he
advocated
the
plan
very
strongly
believing
it
was
a
good
investment
i
afraid
your
mistake
about
paying
him
all
that
money
upset
him
do
mind
if
he
was
a
little
brusque
sir
bob
west
is
a
simple
kindly
man
whom
my
father
fully
trusted
it
was
he
that
loaned
me
the
money
to
get
away
from
here
with
tell
me
said
uncle
john
thoughtfully
did
your
father
receive
stock
in
the
almaquo
timber
tract
company
in
exchange
for
his
money
oh
yes
i
have
seen
it
in
the
steel
cupboard
replied
joe
where
is
that
why
it
is
the
cupboard
in
the
right
wing
of
our
house
which
was
the
captain
own
room
it
was
one
of
his
whims
when
he
built
to
provide
what
he
called
his
you
may
have
noticed
the
wooden
doors
of
a
cupboard
built
into
the
stone
wall
sir
yes
i
occupy
the
room
behind
the
wooden
doors
are
others
of
steel
the
entire
cupboard
is
near
the
bottom
is
a
which
when
pushed
aside
discovers
a
hidden
drawer
a
secret
my
father
never
confided
to
anyone
but
me
he
once
told
me
that
if
his
heart
trouble
earned
him
off
suddenly
i
ought
to
know
of
the
existence
of
this
drawer
so
he
showed
me
how
to
find
it
on
the
day
after
his
death
i
took
the
keys
which
he
always
carried
on
a
small
chain
around
his
neck
and
concealed
underneath
his
clothing
and
opened
the
cupboard
to
see
if
i
could
find
anything
of
value
it
is
needless
to
say
i
could
not
discover
anything
that
could
be
converted
into
a
dollar
the
captain
had
filled
the
cupboard
with
old
letters
and
papers
of
no
value
and
with
relics
he
had
brought
from
foreign
lands
during
his
many
voyages
these
last
are
mere
rubbish
but
i
suppose
he
loved
them
for
their
association
in
the
secret
drawer
i
found
his
stock
in
the
timber
company
and
also
that
of
old
will
thompson
who
had
doubtless
left
it
with
my
father
for
safekeeping
knowing
it
was
now
worthless
i
left
it
in
the
drawer
i
like
to
see
it
announced
uncle
john
joe
laughed
i
lost
the
keys
he
said
how
that
my
lad
why
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
the
keys
disappeared
i
could
never
imagine
what
became
of
them
but
i
did
not
care
to
look
in
the
cupboard
a
second
time
so
the
loss
did
not
matter
merrick
seemed
thoughtful
i
suppose
i
own
that
cupboard
now
he
remarked
of
course
said
joe
but
without
the
keys
it
is
not
serviceable
if
you
drill
through
the
steel
doors
you
destroy
their
security
true
but
i
may
decide
to
do
that
if
you
do
sir
i
like
you
to
clear
out
the
rubbish
and
papers
and
send
them
to
me
they
are
family
matters
and
i
did
not
intend
to
sell
them
with
the
place
you
shall
have
them
joe
just
underneath
the
left
end
of
the
lower
shelf
you
will
find
the
sliding
steel
plate
it
slides
toward
the
front
in
the
drawer
you
will
find
the
worthless
stock
and
a
picture
of
my
mother
i
like
to
keep
the
picture
you
shall
joseph
how
are
you
getting
on
why
i
a
new
man
merrick
and
today
i
feeling
as
strong
as
a
buffalo
thanks
to
your
kind
guardianship
do
overdo
sir
take
it
easy
there
a
young
lady
coming
to
see
you
today
ethel
the
boy
exclaimed
his
face
turning
crimson
yes
returned
uncle
john
tersely
you
treated
that
girl
shamefully
joseph
wegg
try
to
make
proper
amends
i
never
could
understand
said
joe
slowly
why
ethel
refused
to
answer
the
letter
i
wrote
her
when
i
went
away
it
explained
everything
yet
i
bet
the
farm
against
your
lame
shoulder
she
never
got
your
letter
declared
uncle
john
she
thought
you
left
her
without
a
word
i
gave
it
to
mcnutt
to
deliver
after
i
was
gone
but
you
say
coming
today
that
is
her
intention
sir
joe
said
nothing
more
but
his
expressive
face
was
smiling
and
eager
uncle
john
pressed
the
boy
hand
and
left
him
promising
to
call
again
soon
now
then
muttered
the
little
millionaire
as
he
walked
down
the
street
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
the
den
proved
to
be
the
hardware
store
and
the
lion
none
other
than
robert
west
merrick
found
the
merchant
seated
at
his
desk
in
the
otherwise
deserted
store
and
with
a
nod
helped
himself
to
the
only
other
chair
the
little
office
contained
sir
said
he
i
am
here
to
demand
an
explanation
of
what
asked
west
coldly
of
your
action
in
the
matter
of
the
almaquo
timber
tract
company
i
believe
that
you
falsely
asserted
to
captain
wegg
and
thompson
that
the
timber
had
burned
and
their
investment
was
therefore
worthless
the
news
of
the
disaster
killed
one
of
your
confiding
friends
and
drove
the
other
mad
but
that
was
a
consequence
that
i
am
sure
you
did
not
intend
when
you
planned
the
fraud
the
most
serious
thing
i
can
accuse
you
of
is
holding
the
earnings
of
the
wegg
and
thompson
stock
and
big
earnings
they
are
too
for
your
own
benefit
and
defrauding
the
heirs
of
your
associates
of
their
money
west
carefully
balanced
a
penholder
across
his
fingers
and
eyed
it
with
close
attention
you
are
a
queer
man
merrick
he
said
quietly
i
can
only
excuse
your
insults
on
the
grounds
of
ignorance
or
the
fact
that
you
have
been
misinformed
here
is
the
newspaper
report
of
the
almaquo
fire
which
i
showed
my
friends
the
night
of
captain
wegg
sudden
death
he
took
a
clipping
from
a
drawer
of
the
desk
and
handed
it
to
uncle
john
who
read
it
carefully
as
a
matter
of
fact
continued
west
you
are
not
cutting
that
portion
of
the
almaquo
tract
which
this
fire
refers
to
and
which
thompson
and
wegg
were
interested
in
but
the
north
half
of
the
tract
which
they
had
never
acquired
any
title
to
i
suppose
the
stock
will
show
that
suggested
merrick
of
course
sir
i
will
look
it
up
west
smiled
you
will
have
some
trouble
doing
that
he
said
why
wegg
and
thompson
had
transferred
their
entire
stock
to
me
before
one
died
and
the
other
went
mad
was
the
quiet
reply
oh
i
see
the
lie
was
so
evident
that
uncle
john
did
not
try
to
refute
it
i
am
rather
busy
merrick
anything
more
sir
not
today
bye
and
bye
mr
west
he
marched
out
again
and
climbed
into
his
buggy
to
drive
home
the
interview
with
bob
west
had
made
him
uneasy
for
the
merchant
cold
crafty
nature
rendered
him
an
opponent
who
would
stick
at
nothing
to
protect
his
gains
uncle
john
had
thought
it
an
easy
matter
to
force
him
to
disgorge
but
west
was
the
one
inhabitant
of
millville
who
had
no
simplicity
in
his
character
he
was
as
thoroughly
imbued
with
worldly
subtlety
and
cunning
as
if
he
had
lived
amid
the
grille
of
a
city
all
his
life
and
merrick
was
by
no
means
sure
of
his
own
ability
to
unmask
the
man
and
force
him
to
make
restitution
chapter

the
of
skim
clark
by
this
time
the
summer
was
well
advanced
and
the
rich
people
at
the
wegg
farm
had
ceased
to
be
objects
of
wonder
to
the
millville
folk
the
girls
were
still
regarded
with
curious
looks
when
they
wandered
into
the
village
on
an
errand
and
merrick
and
major
doyle
inspired
a
certain
amount
of
awe
but
time
had
dulled
the
edge
of
marvelous
invasion
and
the
city
people
were
now
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
peggy
mcnutt
was
still
bothering
his
head
over
schemes
to
fleece
the
strangers
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
one
of
his
neighbors
was
planning
to
get
ahead
of
him
the
widow
clark
was
a
shrewd
woman
she
had
proven
this
by
becoming
one
of
the
merchants
of
millville
after
her
husband
death
the
poor
man
had
left
an
insurance
of
five
hundred
dollars
and
the
little
frame
building
wherein
he
had
conducted
a
harness
shop
clark
make
and
repair
harness
so
she
cleared
the
straps
and
scraps
and
out
of
the
place
painted
the
interior
of
the
shop
bright
yellow
with
a
blue
ceiling
erected
some
shelves
and
a
counter
and
turned
part
of
the
insurance
money
into
candy
cigars
stationery
and
a
meager
stock
of
novels
skim
her
small
son
helped
her
as
far
as
he
was
able
and
between
them
they
managed
things
so
frugally
that
at
the
end
of
eight
years
the
widow
still
had
her
five
hundred
dollars
capital
and
the
little
store
had
paid
her
living
expenses
skim
was
named
after
his
uncle
peter
skimbley
who
owned
a
farm
near
watertown
the
widow
hopeful
was
now
a
lank
youth
of
eighteen
whose
most
imposing
features
were
his
big
hands
and
a
long
nose
that
ended
in
a
sharp
point
the
shop
had
ruined
him
for
manual
labor
for
he
sat
hunched
up
by
the
stove
in
winter
and
in
summer
hung
around
cotting
store
and
listened
to
the
gossip
of
the
loungers
he
was
a
boy
of
small
conversational
powers
but
his
mother
declared
that
skim
done
a
heap
o
thinkin
that
nobody
suspected
the
widow
was
a
good
gossip
herself
and
knew
all
the
happenings
in
the
little
town
she
had
a
habit
of
reading
all
her
stock
of
novels
before
she
sold
them
and
her
mind
was
stocked
with
the
mass
of
romance
and
adventure
she
had
thus
absorbed
what
i
loves
more
or
she
often
said
is
a
rattlin
good
love
story
there
do
seem
to
be
much
love
in
real
life
so
a
poor
lone
crittur
like
me
has
to
calm
her
hankerin
by
novels
no
one
had
been
more
interested
in
the
advent
of
the
millionaire
at
the
wegg
farm
than
the
widow
clark
she
had
helped
fix
up
the
house
for
the
new
owner
and
her
appreciative
soul
had
been
duly
impressed
by
the
display
of
wealth
demonstrated
by
the
fine
furniture
sent
down
from
the
city
she
had
watched
the
arrival
of
the
party
and
noticed
with
eager
eyes
the
group
of
three
pretty
and
stylishly
dressed
nieces
who
accompanied
their
rich
uncle
once
or
twice
since
the
young
ladies
had
entered
her
establishment
to
purchase
pens
or
stationery
and
on
such
occasions
the
widow
was
quite
overcome
by
their
condescension
all
this
set
her
thinking
to
some
purpose
one
day
she
walked
over
to
the
farm
and
made
her
way
quietly
to
the
back
door
by
good
fortune
she
found
blind
nora
hemming
napkins
and
in
a
mood
to
converse
nora
was
an
especially
neat
seamstress
but
required
some
one
to
thread
her
needles
mary
the
cook
had
been
doing
this
but
now
clark
sat
down
beside
nora
to
hev
a
little
talk
and
keep
the
needles
supplied
with
thread
she
learned
a
good
deal
about
the
nieces
for
old
nora
could
not
praise
them
enough
they
were
always
sweet
and
kind
to
her
and
she
loved
to
talk
about
them
they
were
all
rich
too
or
would
be
for
their
uncle
had
no
children
of
his
own
and
could
leave
several
millions
to
each
one
when
he
died
an
they
so
simple

the
old
woman

marthy
clark
an
money

spiled
a
bit
this
report
tended
to
waken
a
great
ambition
in
the
widow
heart
or
perhaps
the
ambition
had
already
taken
form
and
this
gossip
confirmed
and
established
it
before
she
left
the
farm
she
had
a
chance
to
secretly
observe
the
girls
and
they
met
with
her
full
approval
at
supper
that
evening
she
said
to
her
hopeful
skim
i
want

up
in
amazement

asked

of

held
his
knife
in
his
mouth
a
moment
while
he
thought
over
this
startling
proposition
then
he
removed

cutlery
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
enquired

at
once
he
gulped
down
his
tea
and
stared
at
the
opposite
wall
in
deep
thought
it
was
such
a
tarnal
bad
notion
after
all
and
so
thoroughly
impressed
was
he
with
his
own
importance
and
merit
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
he
would
meet
with
any
difficulties
if
he
chose

chapter
xx
a
lost
cause
the
boy
musings
confirmed
him
in
the
idea
that
his
mother
scheme
was
entirely
practical
he
did
hanker
much
to
marry
being
young
and
fairly
satisfied
with
his
present
lot
but
opportunities
like
this
did
not
often
occur
and
it
seemed
his
bounden
duty
to
take
advantage
of
it
he
got
the
store
clothes
next
day
together
with
a
scarlet
necktie
that
was
all
made
up
in
the
latest
style
as
sam
cotting
assured
him
and
a
pair
of
yellow
kid
gloves
fit
fer
a
howlin
swell
skim
sure
at
first
about
the
gloves
but
capitulated
when
sam
declared
they
were
real
cityfied
in
the
evening
he
togged
up
with
his
mother
help
and
then
walked
over
to
the
wegg
farm
beth
answered
the
knock
at
the
door
the
living
room
was
brightly
lighted
uncle
john
and
the
major
were
playing
checkers
in
a
corner
and
patsy
was
softly
drumming
on
the
piano
louise
had
a
book
and
beth
had
been
engaged
upon
some
when
the
door
opened
skim
bobbed
his
head
and
said
evenin
mom
i
come
beth
conquered
an
inclination
to
smile
wo
you
come
in
she
said
sweetly
thankee
i
will
i
skimbley
clark
ye
know
down
t
the
village
ma
keeps
a
store
there
i
pleased
to
meet
you
clark
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
my
uncle
and
cousins
said
the
girl
her
eyes
dancing
with
amusement
skim
acknowledged
the
introductions
with
intense
gravity
and
then
sat
down
upon
a
chair
near
the
piano
this
being
the
end
of
the
room
where
the
three
girls
were
grouped
uncle
john
gave
a
chuckle
and
resumed
his
game
with
the
major
who
whispered
that
he
would
give
a
dollar
for
an
oil
painting
of
clark
if
it
could
be
had
for
less
louise
laid
down
her
book
and
regarded
the
visitor
wonderingly
patsy
scented
fun
and
drew
a
chair
nearer
the
group
beth
resumed
her
embroidery
with
a
demure
smile
that
made
skim
decide
at
once
that
he
picked
the
pretty
one
indeed
the
decision
did
justice
to
his
discretion
beth
de
graf
was
a
rarely
beautiful
girl
and
quite
outshone
her
cousins
in
this
respect
louise
might
be
attractive
and
patsy
fascinating
but
beth
was
the
real
beauty
of
the
trio
and
the
most
charming
trait
in
her
character
was
her
unconsciousness
that
she
excelled
in
good
looks
so
skim
stared
hard
at
beth
and
answered
the
preliminary
remarks
addressed
to
him
by
patsy
and
louise
in
a
perfunctory
manner
wo
you
take
off
your
gloves
asked
louise
soberly
it
so
warm
this
evening
you
know
the
boy
looked
at
his
hands
it
sech
a
tarnal
job
to
git
on
agin
he
replied
do
put
them
on
then
advised
patsy
here
in
the
country
we
are
allowed
to
dispense
with
much
unnecessary
social
etiquette
air
ye
then
off
they
come
i
ai
much
stuck
on
gloves
myself
but
ma
she
that
a
feller
goin
courtin
orter
look
like
a
sport
a
chorus
of
wild
laughter
which
greeted
this
speech
had
the
effect
of
making
skim
stare
at
the
girls
indignantly
he
could
find
anything
funny
in
his
remark
but
there
they
sat
facing
him
and
uttering
hysterical
peals
of
merriment
until
the
tears
ran
down
their
cheeks
silently
and
with
caution
he
removed
the
yellow
gloves
from
his
hands
and
so
gave
the
foolish
creatures
a
chance
to
laugh
out
their
blamed
giggle
but
they
were
watching
him
and
saw
that
he
was
disconcerted
they
had
no
mind
to
ruin
the
enjoyment
in
store
for
them
by
offending
their
guest
so
they
soon
resumed
a
fitting
gravity
and
began
to
assist
the
youth
to
forget
their
rudeness
may
i
ask
said
patsy
very
graciously
which
one
of
us
you
intend
to
favor
with
your
attentions
i
ai
much
used
to
sech
things
he
replied
looking
down
at
his
big
hands
and
growing
a
little
i
had
orter
tell
before
the
rest
o
ye
oh
yes
do
tell
pleaded
louise
we
so
anxious
to
know
i
do
it
right
clever
to
pick
an
choose
when
ye
all
by
said
skim
regaining
confidence
but
ma
she
thet
with
three
gals
handy
i
orter
git
one
on
to
say
the
least
if
you
got
more
than
one
remarked
beth
calmly
it
would
be
illegal
oh
one
enough
said
skim
with
a
grin
peggy
says
it
too
many
an
a
feller
ought
to
take
his
gal
a
i
should
think
not
indeed
returned
patsy
but
here
are
three
of
us
openly
displayed
and
unless
you
turn
us
all
down
as
unworthy
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
make
a
choice
what
foolishness
are
you
girls
up
to
now
demanded
uncle
john
catching
a
stray
word
from
the
other
corner
while
engaged
in
a
desperate
struggle
with
the
major
this
is
a
time
for
you
to
keep
quiet
uncle
retorted
patsy
merrily
we
got
important
things
to
consider
that
are
none
of
your
affairs
whatever
skim
reflected
that
he
did
want
this
one
except
as
a
last
resort
she
was
too
bossy
when
i
started
out
he
said
i
jest
come
as
any
feller
might
do
thet
was
much
acquainted
but
ef
i
got
to
settle
down
to
one
o
ye
he
hesitated
oh
you
must
really
take
one
at
a
time
you
know
asserted
louise
it
the
only
proper
way
then
i
start
on
thet
one
thet
a
sewin
he
said
slowly
beth
looked
up
from
her
work
and
smiled
go
ahead
clark
she
said
encouragingly
my
name
is
beth
had
you
forgotten
it
call
me
skim
he
said
gently
very
well
skim
now
look
here
patsy
doyle
if
you
going
to
sit
there
and
giggle
you
spoil
everything
clark
wants
to
court
and
it
getting
late
i
went
fur
enough
fer
tonight
remarked
skim
uneasily
next
time
they
leave
us
alone
an
then
oh
do
postpone
it
please
begged
beth
giving
the
boy
a
demure
glance
from
her
soft
brown
eyes
and
do
mind
my
cousins
i
do
these
things
kai
be
hurried
he
said
si
merkle
courted
three
weeks
afore
he
popped
he
tol
me
so
then
he
was
a
very
foolish
man
declared
patsy
positively
just
look
at
beth
she
dying
to
have
you
speak
out
what
the
use
of
waiting
when
she
knows
why
you
are
here
by
this
time
skim
had
been
flattered
to
the
extent
of
destroying
any
stray
sense
he
might
ever
have
possessed
his
utter
ignorance
of
girls
and
their
ways
may
have
been
partly
responsible
for
his
idiocy
or
his
mother
conviction
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
for
him
to
declare
himself
in
order
to
be
accepted
had
misled
him
and
induced
him
to
abandon
any
native
diffidence
he
might
have
had
anyway
the
boy
fell
into
the
snare
set
by
the
mischievous
young
ladies
without
a
suspicion
of
his
impending
fate
miss
beth
said
he
ef
yer
willin
i
marry
ye
any
time
ye
say
i
agreed
t
help
dick
pearson
with
the
harvestin
but
i
try
to
git
ned
long
to
take
my
place
an
it
do
matter
much
nohow
but
i
could
have
you
break
an
engagement
cried
beth
hastily
why
not
oh
it
would
be
right
at
all
pearson
would
never
forgive
me
she
asserted
ca
ye
no
not
before
harvest
skim
i
could
think
of
it
but
arterward
no
i
resolved
never
to
marry
after
harvest
so
as
you
engaged
and
i
do
approve
of
breaking
engagements
i
must
refuse
your
proposition
entirely
skim
looked
surprised
then
perplexed
then
annoyed
i
did
pop
jest
right
he
murmured
growing
red
again
you
popped
beautifully
declared
patsy
but
beth
is
very
peculiar
and
set
in
her
ways
i
afraid
she
would
make
you
a
good
wife
anyhow
then
the
gal
in
blue
no
said
louise
i
have
the
same
prejudices
as
my
cousin
if
you
had
been
engaged
for
the
harvest
i
might
have
listened
to
you
but
that
settles
the
matter
definitely
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
skim
sighed
ma
be
mad
as
a
hornet
ef
i
do
get
any
of
ye
he
remarked
sadly
she
paid
sam
cotting
fer
this
courtin
suit
an
he
wo
take
back
the
gloves
on
no
arter
they
been
wore
an
thet
set
ma
crazy
miss
patsy
ef
yo
think
ye
could
i
sure
i
could
said
patsy
promptly
i
awfully
sorry
to
break
your
heart
skim
dear
and
ruin
your
future
life
and
make
you
misanthropic
and
cynical
and
spoil
your
mother
investment
and
make
her
mad
as
a
hornet
all
this
grieves
me
terribly
but
i
recover
from
it
if
you
only
give
me
time
and
i
hope
you
find
a
wife
that
will
be
more
congenial
than
i
could
ever
be
skim
did
understand
all
these
words
but
the
general
tenor
of
the
speech
was
convincing
and
filled
him
with
dismay
rich
gals
is
tarnal
skeerce
in
these
parts
he
said
regretfully
then
they
gave
way
again
and
so
lusty
was
the
merriment
that
uncle
john
and
the
major
abandoned
their
game
and
came
across
the
room
to
discover
the
source
of
all
this
amusement
what
up
young
women
asked
their
uncle
glancing
from
their
laughing
faces
to
the
lowering
sullen
one
of
the
boy
who
had
only
now
begun
to
suspect
that
he
was
being
poked
fun
at
oh
uncle
cried
patsy
you
no
idea
how
near
you
have
been
to
losing
us
we
have
each
had
an
offer
of
marriage
within
the
last
half
hour
dear
me
ejaculated
uncle
john
it
shows
the
young
man
intelligence
and
good
taste
said
the
major
much
amused
but
is
it
a
mormon
ye
are
sir
to
want
all
three
directing
a
keen
glance
at
skim
naw
he
returned
wholly
disgusted
with
the
outcome
of
his
suit
all
three
got
none
of
got
sense
enough
t
know
a
good
thing
when
they
seen
it
but
i
do
said
the
major
stoutly
and
i
maintain
that
you
a
good
thing
and
always
will
be
i
hope
sir
you
call
and
see
me
in
baltimore
next
year
i
not
be
there
but
ye
can
leave
your
card
just
the
same
please
call
again
sir
added
uncle
john
about
october
just
before
snow
flies
the
boy
got
up
i
do
keer
none
he
said
defiantly
it
all
ma
fault
me
laughed
at
an
she
wo
hear
the
last
of
it
in
a
hurry
nuther
be
gentle
with
her
skim
suggested
beth
softly
remember
she
has
to
face
the
world
with
you
by
her
side
having
no
retort
for
this
raillery
which
he
felt
rather
than
understood
skim
seized
his
hat
and
fled
then
patsy
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
said
was
it
grand
girls
i
have
had
so
much
fun
since
i
was
born
chapter
xxi
the
trap
is
set
uncle
john
was
forced
to
acknowledge
to
his
nieces
that
his
boast
to
unmask
bob
west
within
three
days
was
mere
blustering
if
he
accomplished
anything
in
three
weeks
he
would
consider
himself
fortunate
but
he
had
no
wish
to
conceal
anything
from
the
girls
so
he
told
them
frankly
of
his
interview
with
the
hardware
merchant
and
also
what
joe
wegg
had
said
about
the
stock
in
the
locked
cupboard
they
were
of
course
greatly
interested
in
this
new
phase
of
the
matter
and
canvassed
it
long
and
eagerly
the
man
is
lying
of
course
said
patsy
for
captain
wegg
and
poor
thompson
could
not
transfer
their
stock
to
west
after
that
fatal
night
when
he
brought
to
them
the
news
of
the
fire
i
believe
the
stock
is
still
in
this
cupboard
declared
uncle
john
unless
west
stole
the
keys
and
has
taken
it
away
suggested
louise
i
sure
he
did
not
know
about
the
secret
drawer
said
her
uncle
probably
he
stole
the
keys
and
searched
the
cupboard
if
he
had
found
the
stock
he
would
have
left
the
keys
which
would
then
be
of
no
further
use
to
him
as
he
did
not
find
the
stock
certificates
he
carried
the
keys
away
that
he
might
search
again
at
his
leisure
and
they
never
yet
been
returned
why
john
ye
possessed
of
the
true
detective
instinct
the
major
remarked
admiringly
your
reasoning
is
at
once
clever
and
unassailable
i
wonder
mused
beth
if
we
could
tempt
west
to
come
again
to
search
the
cupboard
he
will
scarcely
venture
to
do
that
while
we
are
here
replied
uncle
john
i
said
him
uncle
and
what
did
you
mean
by
that
expression
beth
i
think
it
over
and
tell
you
later
she
returned
quietly
ethel
thompson
would
have
shown
joe
wegg
how
much
she
resented
his
leaving
millville
without
a
word
to
her
had
she
not
learned
from
merrick
the
boy
sad
condition
knowing
her
old
friend
was
ill
she
determined
to
ignore
the
past
and
go
to
him
at
once
and
uncle
john
knew
very
well
there
would
be
explanations
to
smooth
away
all
the
former
misunderstandings
joe
was
now
aware
of
the
fact
that
his
letter
to
ethel
had
never
reached
its
destination
so
as
soon
as
the
girl
had
arrived
and
the
first
rather
formal
greetings
were
over
he
sent
kate
kebble
to
mcnutt
to
ask
the
agent
to
come
over
to
the
hotel
at
once
the
girl
returned
alone
peggy
says
as
he
ca
come
she
announced
why
not
asked
joe
says
he
jest
painted
his
off
foot
blue
an
striped

with
red
it
hai

back
said
joe
firmly
tell
peggy
he
in
trouble
and
likely
to
cost
him
more
than
a
new
coat
of
paint
for
his
foot
if
he
does
come
here
at
once
kate
went
back
and
in
due
time
the
stump
of
mcnutt
foot
was
heard
on
the
stairs
he
entered
the
room
looking
worried
and
suspicious
and
the
stern
faces
of
ethel
and
joe
did
not
reassure
him
by
any
means
but
he
tried
to
disarm
the
pending
accusation
with
his
usual
brazen
impertinence
nice
time

grumbled

joe

mcnutt

cheerfully

ef

to
cross
thet
dusty
road
more
i
hev
to
paint
all
over
agin
an
thet
a
fact
ethel
said
joe
with
the
calmness
of
despair
you
have
to
telephone
over
to
the
junction
and
ask
them
to
send
a
constable
here
at
once
never
mind
cried
mcnutt
jumping
up
hastily
i
go
paint
cost
much
nohow
he
stumped
away
but
on
his
return
preferred
to
let
kate
carry
the
soiled
torn
envelope
up
to
the
young
folks
the
letter
had
palpably
been
tampered
with
it
had
been
opened
and
doubtless
read
and
the
flap
clumsily
glued
down
again
but
ethel
had
it
now
and
even
after
three
years
her
sweet
eyes
dimmed
as
she
read
the
tender
words
that
joe
had
written
because
he
lacked
the
courage
to
speak
them
my
one
great
ambition
is
to
win
a
home
for
us
dear
he
had
declared
and
with
this
before
her
eyes
ethel
reproached
herself
for
ever
doubting
his
love
or
loyalty
when
she
rode
her
pony
over
to
the
wegg
farm
next
day
ethel
bright
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
she
told
her
girl
friends
that
she
and
joe
had
had
a
good
talk
together
and
understood
each
other
better
than
ever
before
the
nieces
did
not
tell
her
of
their
newly
conceived
hopes
that
the
young
couple
would
presently
possess
enough
money
to
render
their
future
comfortable
because
there
were
so
many
chances
that
bob
west
might
win
the
little
game
being
played
but
at
this
moment
ethel
did
not
need
worldly
wealth
to
make
her
heart
light
and
happy
for
she
had
regained
her
childhood
friend
and
his
injuries
only
rendered
the
boy
the
more
interesting
and
companionable
meantime
uncle
john
had
been
busily
thinking
it
annoyed
him
to
be
so
composedly
defied
by
a
rascally
country
merchant
and
he
resolved
if
he
must
fight
to
fight
with
all
his
might
so
he
wired
to
his
agent
in
new
york
the
following
words
what
part
of
the
almaquo
timber
tract
burned
in
forest
fire
three
years
ago
the
answer
he
received
made
him
give
a
satisfied
grunt
no
forest
fires
near
almaquo
three
years
ago
almadona
seventy
miles
north
burned
at
that
time
and
newspaper
reports
confounded
the
names
very
good
exclaimed
uncle
john
i
got
the
rascal
now
he
issued
instructions
to
the
lumber
company
to
make
no
further
payments
of
royalties
to
robert
west
until
otherwise
advised
and
this
had
the
effect
of
bringing
west
to
the
farm
white
with
rage
what
do
you
mean
by
this
action
mr
merrick
he
demanded
we
been
paying
you
money
that
does
not
belong
to
you
for
three
years
sir
was
the
reply
in
a
few
days
when
my
investigations
are
complete
i
will
give
you
the
option
of
being
arrested
for
embezzlement
of
funds
belonging
to
joseph
wegg
and
the
thompsons
or
restoring
to
them
every
penny
of
their
money
west
stared
you
are
carrying
matters
with
a
high
hand
sir
he
sneered
oh
no
i
am
acting
very
leniently
said
uncle
john
neither
joe
nor
the
thompsons
own
a
dollar
interest
in
the
almaquo
property
it
is
all
mine
and
mine
alone
then
produce
the
stock
and
prove
it
retorted
merrick
triumphantly
at
that
moment
louise
interrupted
the
interview
by
entering
the
room
suddenly
oh
uncle
said
she
will
you
join
us
in
a
picnic
to
the
falls
tomorrow
afternoon
we
are
all
going
then
i
wo
be
left
behind
he
replied
smiling
upon
her
we
shall
take
even
thomas
and
nora
and
come
home
late
in
the
evening
by
moonlight
that
suits
me
my
dear
said
he
west
stood
silent
and
scowling
but
as
the
girl
tripped
away
she
saw
him
raise
his
eyes
and
glance
slyly
toward
the
cupboard
for
they
were
in
the
right
wing
room
merrick
he
resumed
in
a
harsh
voice
i
warn
you
that
if
your
company
holds
up
the
payment
of
my
royalties
it
will
break
the
contract
and
i
will
forbid
them
to
cut
another
tree
you
are
doubtless
aware
that
there
are
a
dozen
firms
willing
to
take
your
place
and
pay
me
higher
royalties
act
as
you
please
sir
said
uncle
john
indifferently
i
believe
you
are
face
to
face
with
ruin
and
it
wo
matter
much
what
you
do
west
went
away
more
quietly
than
he
had
come
and
the
girls
exclaimed
delightedly
the
trap
is
set
uncle
i
think
so
myself
he
rejoined
that
picnic
was
a
happy
thought
louise
early
the
next
afternoon
they
started
out
with
hammocks
and
baskets
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
a
picnic
party
the
three
girls
nora
and
uncle
john
squeezed
themselves
into
the
surrey
while
the
major
and
old
hucks
rode
after
them
in
the
ancient
buggy
with
dan
moaning
and
groaning
every
step
he
took
but
the
old
horse
moved
more
briskly
when
following
joe
and
hucks
could
get
more
speed
out
of
him
than
anyone
else
so
he
did
not
lag
much
behind
the
procession
entered
millville
where
a
brief
stop
was
made
at
the
store
and
then
made
its
exit
by
the
north
road
west
was
standing
in
the
door
of
his
hardware
store
quietly
observing
them
when
they
disappeared
in
the
grove
he
locked
the
door
of
his
establishment
and
sauntered
in
the
direction
of
the
pearson
farm
no
one
noticing
him
except
peggy
mcnutt
who
was
disappointed
because
he
had
intended
to
go
over
presently
and
buy
a
paper
of
tacks
when
the
village
was
left
behind
uncle
john
drove
swiftly
along
following
the
curve
of
the
lake
until
he
reached
a
primitive
lane
that
he
had
discovered
formed
a
short
cut
directly
back
to
the
wegg
farm
old
thomas
was
amazed
by
this
queer
action
on
the
part
of
the
picnic
party
but
aside
from
blind
nora
who
had
no
idea
where
they
were
the
others
seemed
full
of
repressed
eagerness
and
in
no
way
surprised
the
lane
proved
very
rocky
though
and
they
were
obliged
to
jolt
slowly
over
the
big
cobble
stones
so
beth
and
patsy
leaped
out
of
the
surrey
and
the
former
called
out
we
will
run
through
the
forest
uncle
and
get
home
as
soon
as
you
do
be
careful
not
to
show
yourselves
then
he
replied
remember
our
plans
we
will
and
do
forget
to
tie
the
horses
in
the
thicket
and
warn
thomas
and
nora
to
keep
quiet
until
we
come
for
them
said
patsy
i
attend
to
all
that
dear
remarked
louise
composedly
but
if
you
girls
are
determined
to
walk
you
must
hurry
along
or
you
will
keep
us
waiting
the
nieces
had
explored
every
path
in
the
neighborhood
by
this
time
so
beth
and
patsy
were
quite
at
home
in
the
pine
forest
the
horses
started
up
again
and
after
struggling
along
another
quarter
of
a
mile
a
wheel
of
the
surrey
dished
between
two
stones
and
with
a
bump
the
axle
struck
the
ground
and
the
journey
was
promptly
arrested
what
shall
we
do
now
asked
uncle
john
much
annoyed
as
the
party
alighted
to
examine
the
wreck
send
thomas
back
to
the
village
for
another
wheel
suggested
the
major
not
today
cried
louise
we
must
appear
in
the
village
again
this
afternoon
on
any
account
it
is
absolutely
necessary
we
should
keep
out
of
sight
true
agreed
uncle
john
promptly
thomas
and
nora
must
picnic
here
all
by
themselves
until
nearly
midnight
then
they
may
drive
the
buggy
home
leading
daniel
behind
them
it
will
be
time
enough
tomorrow
to
get
a
new
buggy
wheel
and
the
broken
surrey
wo
be
in
anybody
way
until
we
send
for
it
if
old
hucks
thought
they
had
all
gone
crazy
that
day
he
was
seemingly
justified
in
the
suspicion
for
his
master
left
the
baskets
of
good
things
to
be
consumed
by
himself
and
nora
and
started
to
walk
to
the
farm
the
major
and
louise
accompanying
him
we
must
loiter
said
the
girl
for
while
west
may
wait
until
darkness
falls
to
visit
the
farm
he
is
equally
liable
to
arrive
at
any
time
this
afternoon
he
has
seen
us
all
depart
and
believes
the
house
deserted
but
they
were
obliged
to
keep
to
the
lane
where
walking
was
difficult
and
meantime
patsy
and
beth
were
tripping
easily
along
their
woodland
paths
and
making
much
better
progress
chapter
xxii
caught
we
early
said
beth
as
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
sighted
the
farm
house
but
that
is
better
than
being
late
then
she
stopped
suddenly
with
a
low
cry
and
pointed
to
the
right
wing
which
directly
faced
them
bob
west
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
tried
the
door
of
uncle
john
room
and
then
walked
to
one
of
the
french
windows
the
sash
was
not
fastened
so
he
deliberately
opened
it
and
stepped
inside
what
shall
we
do
gasped
patsy
clasping
her
hands
excitedly
beth
was
always
cool
in
an
emergency
you
creep
up
to
the
window
dear
and
wait
till
you
hear
me
open
the
inside
door
said
she
i
run
through
the
house
and
enter
from
the
the
key
is
under
the
mat
you
know
but
what
can
we
do
ought
we
to
wait
until
uncle
john
and
father
come
patsy
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
of
course
not
west
might
rob
the
cupboard
and
be
gone
by
that
time
we
got
to
act
promptly
patsy
so
do
be
afraid
without
further
words
beth
ran
around
the
back
of
the
house
and
disappeared
while
patsy
trying
to
control
the
beating
of
her
heart
stole
softly
over
the
lawn
to
the
open
window
of
uncle
john
room
she
could
not
help
looking
in
at
the
risk
of
discovery
bob
west
tall
lean
and
composed
as
ever
was
standing
beside
the
cupboard
the
doors
of
which
were
wide
open
the
outer
doors
were
of
wood
panelled
and
carved
the
inner
ones
were
plates
of
heavy
steel
and
in
the
lock
that
secured
these
latter
doors
were
the
keys
that
had
so
long
been
missing
both
were
attached
to
a
slender
silver
chain
as
patsy
peered
in
at
the
man
west
was
engaged
in
deliberately
examining
packet
after
packet
of
papers
evidently
striving
to
find
the
missing
stock
certificates
he
was
in
no
hurry
believing
he
would
have
the
house
to
himself
for
several
hours
so
he
tumbled
captain
souvenirs
of
foreign
lands
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
beside
him
thrusting
his
hand
into
every
corner
of
the
cupboard
in
order
that
the
search
might
be
thorough
he
had
once
before
examined
the
place
in
vain
this
time
he
intended
to
succeed
presently
west
drew
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
lighted
it
and
was
about
to
throw
the
match
upon
the
floor
when
the
thought
that
it
might
later
betray
his
presence
made
him
pause
and
then
walk
to
the
open
window
as
he
approached
patsy
became
and
well
knowing
that
she
ought
to
run
or
hide
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
gazing
half
appealingly
and
half
defiantly
into
the
startled
eyes
of
the
man
who
suddenly
confronted
her
so
for
a
moment
they
stood
motionless
west
was
thinking
rapidly
by
some
error
be
had
miscounted
the
picnic
party
and
this
girl
had
been
left
at
home
she
had
discovered
his
intrusion
had
seen
him
at
the
cupboard
and
would
report
the
matter
to
john
merrick
this
being
the
case
it
would
do
him
no
good
to
retreat
without
accomplishing
his
purpose
if
once
he
secured
the
stock
certificates
he
could
afford
to
laugh
at
his
accusers
and
secure
them
he
must
while
he
had
the
opportunity
so
clearly
did
these
thoughts
follow
one
another
that
west
hesitation
seemed
only
momentary
without
a
word
to
the
girl
he
tossed
the
match
upon
the
grass
calmly
turned
his
back
and
started
for
the
cupboard
again
but
here
a
new
surprise
awaited
him
brief
as
had
been
his
absence
another
girl
had
entered
the
room
beth
opened
the
door
even
as
west
turned
toward
the
window
and
taking
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
she
tiptoed
swiftly
to
the
cupboard
withdrew
the
keys
from
the
lock
and
dropped
them
noiselessly
into
a
vase
that
stood
on
the
table
and
was
partially
filled
with
flowers
the
next
instant
west
turned
and
saw
her
but
she
smiled
at
him
triumphantly
good
afternoon
sir
said
the
girl
sweetly
can
i
do
anything
to
assist
you
west
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
and
regarded
beth
savagely
is
the
house
full
of
girls
he
demanded
oh
no
patsy
and
i
are
quite
alone
she
replied
with
a
laugh
come
in
patsy
dear
and
help
me
to
entertain
our
guest
she
added
patsy
came
through
the
window
and
stood
beside
her
cousin
the
man
stared
at
them
bit
his
lip
and
then
turned
again
to
the
cupboard
if
he
noted
the
absence
of
the
keys
he
did
not
remark
upon
the
fact
but
with
hurried
yet
thorough
examination
began
anew
to
turn
over
the
bundles
of
papers
beth
sat
down
and
watched
him
but
patsy
remained
standing
behind
her
chair
west
emptied
all
the
shelves
and
then
after
a
pause
took
out
his
pocket
knife
and
began
tapping
with
its
end
the
steel
sides
of
the
cupboard
there
was
no
doubt
he
suspected
the
existence
of
a
secret
aperture
and
beth
began
to
feel
uneasy
slowly
the
man
worked
his
way
downward
from
shelf
to
shelf
and
began
to
sound
the
bottom
plates
wholly
oblivious
of
the
fascinated
gaze
of
the
two
young
girls
then
a
sudden
gruff
ejaculation
startled
them
all
and
west
swung
around
to
find
a
new
group
of
watchers
outside
the
window
in
the
foreground
appeared
the
stern
face
of
john
merrick
the
scene
was
intensely
dramatic
to
all
but
the
singular
man
who
had
been
battling
to
retain
a
fortune
west
knew
in
an
instant
that
his
attempt
to
secure
the
certificates
was
a
failure
he
turned
from
the
cupboard
dusted
his
hands
and
nodded
gravely
to
the
last
arrivals
come
in
merrick
said
he
seating
himself
in
a
chair
and
removing
his
hat
which
he
had
been
wearing
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
intruding
upon
your
premises
in
your
absence
uncle
john
strode
into
the
room
angry
and
indignant
at
the
fellow
cool
impertinence
the
major
and
louise
followed
and
all
eyes
centered
upon
the
face
of
bob
west
the
contents
of
this
cupboard
remarked
the
hardware
merchant
calmly
belong
to
the
estate
of
captain
wegg
and
can
scarcely
be
claimed
by
you
because
you
have
purchased
the
house
you
falsely
accused
me
the
other
day
sir
and
i
have
been
searching
for
proof
that
the
almaquo
timber
tract
stock
is
entirely
my
property
have
you
found
such
proof
inquired
merrick
not
yet
and
you
say
the
stock
was
all
issued
to
you
west
hesitated
it
was
all
transferred
to
me
by
captain
wegg
and
will
thompson
does
the
transfer
appear
upon
the
stock
itself
of
course
sir
in
that
case
said
uncle
john
i
shall
be
obliged
to
ask
your
pardon
but
the
fact
can
be
easily
proved
he
walked
to
the
open
cupboard
felt
for
the
slide
joe
had
described
to
him
and
drew
it
forward
a
small
drawer
was
behind
the
orifice
and
from
this
merrick
drew
a
packet
of
papers
west
gave
a
start
and
half
arose
then
he
settled
back
into
his
chair
again
this
appears
to
be
the
stock
in
question
said
uncle
john
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
unfolded
the
documents
and
examined
them
with
deliberate
care
the
nieces
watched
his
face
curiously
merrick
first
frowned
then
turned
red
and
finally
a
stern
determined
look
settled
upon
his
rugged
features
take
your
stock
west
he
said
tossing
it
toward
the
man
and
try
to
forgive
us
for
making
fools
of
ourselves
chapter
xxiii
west
explains
a
cry
of
amazed
protest
burst
from
the
girls
the
major
whistled
softly
and
walked
to
the
window
i
find
the
stock
properly
transferred
continued
uncle
john
grimly
conscious
that
he
was
as
thoroughly
disappointed
as
the
girls
it
is
signed
by
both
wegg
and
thompson
and
witnessed
in
the
presence
of
a
notary
i
congratulate
you
west
you
have
acquired
a
fortune
but
not
recently
replied
the
hardware
dealer
enjoying
the
confusion
of
his
recent
opponents
i
have
owned
this
stock
for
more
than
three
years
and
you
will
see
by
the
amount
endorsed
upon
it
that
i
paid
a
liberal
price
for
it
under
the
circumstances
uncle
john
gave
a
start
and
a
shrewd
look
of
course
you
did
said
he
on
paper
i
have
records
to
prove
that
both
captain
wegg
and
will
thompson
received
their
money
said
west
quietly
i
see
it
is
hard
for
you
to
abandon
the
idea
that
i
am
a
rogue
there
could
be
no
adequate
reply
to
this
so
for
a
time
all
sat
in
moody
silence
but
the
thoughts
of
some
were
busy
i
would
like
west
to
explain
what
became
of
the
money
he
paid
for
this
stock
said
louise
adding
that
is
if
he
will
be
so
courteous
west
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
then
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
i
am
willing
to
tell
all
i
know
but
you
people
must
admit
that
the
annoyances
you
have
caused
me
during
the
past
fortnight
to
say
nothing
of
the
gratuitous
insults
heaped
upon
my
head
render
me
little
inclined
to
favor
you
you
are
quite
justified
in
feeling
as
you
do
replied
uncle
john
meekly
i
have
been
an
ass
west
but
circumstances
warranted
me
in
suspecting
you
and
even
joseph
wegg
did
not
know
that
the
almaquo
stock
had
been
transferred
to
you
he
merely
glanced
at
it
at
the
time
of
his
father
death
without
noticing
the
endorsement
and
thought
the
fire
had
rendered
it
worthless
but
if
you
then
owned
the
stock
why
was
it
not
in
your
possession
that
was
due
to
my
carelessness
was
the
reply
the
only
notary
around
here
is
at
hooker
falls
and
thompson
offered
to
have
him
come
to
captain
wegg
residence
and
witness
the
transfer
as
my
presence
was
not
necessary
for
this
and
i
had
full
confidence
in
my
friends
integrity
i
paid
them
their
money
which
they
were
eager
to
secure
at
once
and
said
i
would
call
in
a
few
days
for
the
stock
i
did
call
and
was
told
the
notary
had
been
here
and
the
transfer
had
been
legally
made
wegg
said
he
would
get
the
stock
from
the
cupboard
and
hand
it
to
me
but
we
both
forgot
it
at
that
time
after
his
death
i
could
not
find
it
for
it
was
in
the
secret
drawer
another
thing
sir
said
uncle
john
if
neither
wegg
nor
thompson
was
then
interested
in
the
almaquo
property
why
did
the
news
of
its
destruction
by
fire
shock
them
so
greatly
that
the
result
was
captain
wegg
death
i
see
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
explain
to
you
more
fully
returned
west
with
a
thoughtful
look
it
is
evident
merrick
from
your
questions
that
some
of
these
occurrences
seem
suspicious
to
a
stranger
and
perhaps
you
are
not
so
much
to
be
blamed
as
in
my
annoyance
and
indignation
i
have
imagined
i
would
like
the
matter
cleared
up
for
the
sake
of
ethel
and
joe
said
merrick
simply
and
so
would
i
declared
the
hardware
dealer
you
must
know
sir
that
will
thompson
was
the
one
who
first
led
captain
wegg
into
investing
his
money
i
think
the
captain
did
it
merely
to
please
will
for
at
that
time
he
had
become
so
indifferent
to
worldly
affairs
that
he
took
no
interest
in
anything
beyond
a
mild
wish
to
provide
for
his
son
future
but
thompson
was
erratic
in
judgment
so
wegg
used
to
bring
their
matters
to
me
to
decide
upon
i
always
advised
them
as
honestly
as
i
was
able
at
the
time
i
secured
an
option
on
the
almaquo
tract
and
wanted
them
to
join
me
will
thompson
had
found
another
lot
of
timber
but
located
in
an
corner
which
he
urged
the
captain
to
join
him
in
buying
wegg
brought
the
matter
to
me
as
usual
and
i
pointed
out
that
my
proposed
contract
with
the
lumber
company
would
assure
our
making
a
handsome
profit
at
almaquo
while
thompson
had
no
one
in
view
to
cut
the
other
tract
indeed
it
was
far
away
from
any
railroad
wegg
saw
the
force
of
my
argument
and
insisted
that
thompson
abandon
his
idea
and
accept
my
proposition
together
we
bought
the
property
having
formed
a
stock
company
and
the
contract
for
cutting
the
timber
was
also
secured
things
were
looking
bright
for
us
and
royalty
payments
would
soon
be
coming
in
then
to
my
amazement
wegg
came
to
me
and
wanted
to
sell
out
their
interests
he
said
thompson
had
always
been
dissatisfied
because
they
had
not
bought
the
other
tract
of
timber
and
that
the
worry
and
disappointment
was
affecting
his
friend
mind
he
was
personally
satisfied
that
my
investment
was
the
best
but
in
order
to
sooth
old
will
and
prevent
his
mind
from
giving
way
wegg
wanted
to
withdraw
and
purchase
the
other
tract
i
knew
there
was
a
fortune
in
almaquo
so
i
went
to
new
york
and
mortgaged
all
i
possessed
discounting
a
lot
of
notes
given
me
by
farmers
in
payment
for
machinery
and
finally
borrowing
at
a
high
rate
of
interest
the
rest
of
the
money
i
needed
in
other
words
i
risked
all
my
fortune
on
almaquo
and
brought
the
money
home
to
pay
wegg
and
thompson
for
their
interest
the
moment
they
received
the
payment
they
invested
it
in
the
bogue
tract
hold
on
cried
uncle
john
what
tract
did
you
say
the
bogue
timber
tract
sir
it
lies
i
know
where
it
lies
our
company
has
been
a
whole
year
trying
to
find
out
who
owned
it
wegg
and
thompson
bought
it
i
was
angry
at
the
time
because
their
withdrawal
had
driven
me
into
a
tight
corner
to
protect
my
investment
and
i
told
them
they
would
bitterly
regret
their
action
i
think
wegg
agreed
with
me
but
will
thompson
was
still
stubborn
then
came
the
news
of
the
fire
at
almaquo
it
was
a
false
report
i
afterward
learned
but
at
that
time
i
believed
the
newspapers
and
the
blow
almost
deprived
me
of
reason
in
my
excitement
i
rushed
over
to
wegg
farm
and
found
the
two
men
together
whereupon
i
told
them
i
was
ruined
the
news
affected
them
powerfully
because
they
had
just
saved
themselves
from
a
like
ruin
they
thought
wegg
was
also
a
sympathetic
man
in
spite
of
his
reserve
his
old
heart
trouble
suddenly
came
upon
him
aggravated
by
the
excitement
of
the
hour
and
he
died
with
scarcely
a
moan
thompson
whose
reason
was
tottering
long
before
this
became
violently
insane
at
witnessing
his
friend
death
and
has
never
since
recovered
that
is
all
i
am
able
to
tell
you
sir
the
bogue
tract
said
uncle
john
slowly
is
worth
far
more
than
the
almaquo
old
will
thompson
was
sane
enough
when
insisting
on
that
investment
but
where
is
the
stock
or
deed
to
show
they
bought
that
property
i
do
not
know
sir
i
only
know
they
told
me
they
had
effected
the
purchase
pardon
me
said
the
major
have
you
not
been
through
this
cupboard
before
west
looked
at
him
with
a
frown
yes
in
a
search
for
my
own
stock
he
said
but
i
found
neither
that
nor
any
deed
to
the
bogue
property
i
am
not
a
thief
major
doyle
you
stole
the
keys
though
said
louise
pointedly
i
did
not
even
do
that
said
west
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
joe
carelessly
left
them
lying
upon
a
table
so
i
slipped
them
into
my
pocket
when
i
thought
of
them
again
joe
had
gone
away
and
i
did
not
know
his
address
i
came
over
and
searched
the
cupboard
unsuccessfully
but
it
was
not
a
matter
of
great
importance
at
that
time
if
the
stock
was
mislaid
since
there
was
no
one
to
contest
my
ownership
of
it
it
was
only
after
merrick
accused
me
of
robbing
my
old
friends
and
ordered
my
payments
stopped
that
i
realized
it
was
important
to
me
to
prove
my
ownership
that
is
why
i
came
here
today
again
a
silence
fell
upon
the
group
said
uncle
john
finally
if
the
deed
to
the
bogue
tract
can
be
found
joe
and
ethel
will
be
rich
i
wonder
what
became
of
the
paper
no
one
answered
for
here
was
another
mystery
chapter

peggy
has
revenge
joe
wegg
made
a
rapid
recovery
his
strength
returning
under
the
influence
of
pleasant
surroundings
and
frequent
visits
from
ethel
and
uncle
john
three
nieces
not
a
word
was
hinted
to
either
the
invalid
or
the
school
teacher
regarding
the
inquiries
merrick
was
making
about
the
deed
to
the
bogue
timber
lands
which
if
found
would
make
the
young
couple
independent
joe
was
planning
to
exploit
a
new
patent
as
soon
as
he
could
earn
enough
to
get
it
introduced
and
ethel
exhibited
a
sublime
confidence
in
the
boy
ability
that
rendered
all
question
of
money
insignificant
joe
sudden
appearance
in
the
land
of
his
birth
and
his
generally
smashed
up
condition
were
a
nine
days
wonder
in
millville
the
gossips
wanted
to
know
all
the
whys
and
wherefores
but
the
boy
kept
his
room
in
the
hotel
or
only
walked
out
when
accompanied
by
ethel
or
one
of
the
three
nieces
sometimes
they
took
him
to
ride
as
he
grew
better
and
the
fact
that
joe
were
hand
an
glove
wi
the
nabobs
lent
him
a
distinction
he
had
never
before
possessed
mcnutt
always
busy
over
somebody
else
affairs
was
very
curious
to
know
what
had
caused
the
accident
joe
had
suffered
notwithstanding
the
little
affair
of
the
letter
in
which
he
had
not
appeared
with
especial
credit
peggy
made
an
effort
to
interview
the
young
man
that
resulted
in
his
complete
discomfiture
but
that
did
not
deter
him
from
indulging
in
various
vivid
speculations
about
joe
wegg
which
the
simple
villagers
listened
to
with
attention
for
one
thing
he
confided
to
the
boys
at
the
store
that
in
his
opinion
the
man
who
had
murdered
wegg
had
tried
to
murder
his
son
also
and
it
was
likely
joe
could
manage
to
escape
him
a
second
time
another
tale
evolved
from
peggy
fertile
imagination
was
that
joe
being
about
to
starve
to
death
in
the
city
had
turned
burglar
and
been
shot
in
the
arm
in
an
attempt
at
housebreaking
would
be
said
the
agent
in
an
awed
voice
ef
the
was
on
his
track
now
there
a
reward
offered
boys
let
keep
an
eye
on
him
he
waylaid
the
nieces
once
or
twice
and
tried
to
secure
from
them
a
verification
of
his
somber
suspicions
which
they
mischievously
fostered
the
girls
found
him
a
source
of
much
amusement
and
relieved
their
own
disappointment
at
finding
the
wegg
mystery
a
pricked
bubble
by
getting
mcnutt
excited
over
many
sly
suggestions
of
hidden
crimes
they
knew
he
was
harmless
for
even
his
neighbors
needed
proof
of
any
assertion
he
made
moreover
the
investigation
uncle
john
was
making
would
soon
set
matters
right
so
the
young
ladies
did
not
hesitate
to
have
fun
at
the
little
agent
expense
one
of
mcnutt
numerous
occupations
was
raising
a
patch
of
watermelons
each
year
on
the
lot
back
of
the
house
these
he
had
fostered
with
great
care
since
the
plants
had
first
sprouted
through
the
soil
and
in
these
late
august
days
two
or
three
hundreds
of
fine
big
melons
were
just
getting
ripe
he
showed
the
patch
with
much
pride
one
day
to
the
nieces
saying
here
the
most
in
this
county
ef
i
do
say
it
myself
dan
brayley
he
thinks
he
kin
raise
mellings
but
the
ol
fool

circumstance

me
observed
patsy
gravely
that

we
passed
his
place
this
morning
and
wondered
how
he
could

enormous

added
beth
quickly
peggy
turned
his
protruding
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
and
a
smile
slowly
spread
over
his
features
by
jinks

cried

patsy
readily

beth

replied
mcnutt
frankly
i
in
it
myself
an
we
jest
find
out
what
his
ol
mellings
is
like
patsy
was
overjoyed
at
the
success
of
her
plot
which
she
had
conceived
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
as
most
clever
plots
are
conceived
on
the
way
home
she
confided
to
her
cousins
a
method
of
securing
revenge
upon
the
agent
for
selling
them
the
three
copies
of
the
lives
of
the
saints
mcnutt
wants
to
get
even
with
brayley
he
says
and
we
want
to
get
even
with
mcnutt
i
think
our
chances
are
best
do
you
she
asked
and
they
decided
to
join
the
conspiracy
there
was
some
difficulty
escaping
from
uncle
john
and
the
major
that
night
but
patsy
got
them
interested
in
a
game
of
chess
that
was
likely
to
last
some
hours
while
beth
stole
to
the
barn
and
harnessed
joe
to
the
surrey
soon
the
others
slipped
out
and
joined
her
and
with
patsy
and
beth
on
the
front
seat
and
louise
inside
the
canopy
they
drove
slowly
away
until
the
sound
of
the
horse
feet
on
the
stones
was
no
longer
likely
to
betray
them
mcnutt
was
waiting
for
them
when
they
quietly
drew
up
before
his
house
the
village
was
dark
and
silent
for
its
inhabitants
retired
early
to
bed
by
good
fortune
the
sky
was
overcast
with
heavy
clouds
and
not
even
the
glimmer
of
a
star
relieved
the
gloom
they
put
mcnutt
on
the
back
seat
with
louise
cautioned
him
to
be
quiet
and
then
drove
away
dan
brayley
place
was
two
miles
distant
but
in
answer
to
peggy
earnest
inquiry
if
she
knew
the
way
beth
declared
she
could
find
it
in
a
few
moments
louise
had
engaged
the
agent
in
a
spirited
discussion
of
the
absorbing
mystery
and
so
occupied
his
attention
that
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
direction
they
had
taken
the
back
seat
was
hemmed
in
by
side
curtains
and
the
canopy
so
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
he
lost
all
sense
of
direction
even
had
not
the
remarks
of
the
girl
at
his
side
completely
absorbed
him
beth
drove
slowly
down
the
main
street
up
a
lane
back
by
the
lake
road
and
along
the
street
again
and
this
programme
was
repeated
several
times
until
she
thought
a
sufficient
distance
had
been
covered
to
convince
the
agent
they
had
arrived
at
brayley
they
way
was
pitch
dark
but
the
horse
was
sensible
enough
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
road
so
they
met
with
no
accident
more
than
to
jolt
over
a
stone
now
and
then
but
now
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
enterprise
lay
before
them
the
girls
turned
down
the
lane
back
of
the
main
street
and
bumped
over
the
ruts
until
they
thought
they
had
arrived
at
a
spot
opposite
mcnutt
own
melon
patch
what
wrong
asked
the
agent
as
they
suddenly
stopped
with
a
jerk
this
ought
to
be
brayley
said
beth
but
it
so
dark
i
not
certain
just
where
we
are
mcnutt
thrust
his
head
out
and
peered
into
the
blackness
drive
along
a
little
he
whispered
the
girl
obeyed
stop
stop
said
he
a
moment
later
i
think
that
them
contwisted
mellings
over
there
they
all
got
out
and
beth
tied
the
horse
to
the
fence
peggy
climbed
over
and
at
once
whispered
come
on
it
them
all
right
through
the
drifting
clouds
there
was
just
enough
light
to
enable
them
to
perceive
the
dark
forms
of
the
melons
lying
side
by
side
upon
their
vines
the
agent
took
out
his
big
clasp
knife
and
recklessly
slashed
one
of
them
open
green
grass
he
grumbled
and
slashed
another
patsy
giggled
and
the
others
felt
a
sudden
irresistible
impulse
to
join
her
keep
still
cautioned
mcnutt
would
ol
dan
be
jest
ravin
ef
he
knew
this
say
here
a
ripe
one
hev
a
slice
they
all
felt
for
the
slices
he
offered
and
ate
the
fruit
without
being
able
to
see
it
but
it
really
tasted
delicious
as
the
girls
feasted
they
heard
a
crunching
sound
and
inquired
in
low
voices
what
it
was
mcnutt
was
stumping
over
the
patch
and
plumping
his
wooden
foot
into
every
melon
he
could
find
smashing
them
wantonly
against
the
ground
the
discovery
filled
them
with
horror
they
had
thought
inducing
the
agent
to
rob
his
own
patch
of
a
few
melons
while
under
the
delusion
that
they
belonged
to
his
enemy
brayley
a
bit
of
harmless
fun
but
here
was
the
vindictive
fellow
actually
destroying
his
own
property
by
the
wholesale
oh
do
please
do
mr
mcnutt
pleaded
patsy
in
frightened
accents
yes
i
will
declared
the
agent
stubbornly
i
git
even
with
dan
brayley
fer
once
in
my
life
ef
i
never
do
another
thing
by
gum
but
it
wrong
it
wicked
protested
beth
ca
help
it
this
is
my
chance
an
i
make
them
bum
mellings
look
like
a
penny
a
piece
afore
i
gits
done
with
never
mind
girls
whispered
louise
it
the
law
of
retribution
poor
peggy
will
be
sorry
for
this
tomorrow
the
man
had
not
the
faintest
suspicion
where
he
was
he
knew
his
own
melon
patch
well
enough
having
worked
in
it
at
times
all
the
summer
but
he
had
never
climbed
over
the
fence
and
approached
it
from
the
rear
before
so
it
took
on
a
new
aspect
to
him
from
this
point
of
view
and
moreover
the
night
was
dark
enough
to
deceive
anybody
if
he
came
across
an
especially
big
melon
mcnutt
would
lug
it
to
the
carriage
and
dump
it
in
and
so
angry
and
energetic
was
the
little
man
that
in
a
brief
space
the
melon
patch
was
a
scene
of
awful
devastation
and
the
surrey
contained
all
the
fruit
that
survived
the
massacre
beth
unhitched
the
horse
and
they
all
took
their
places
in
the
carriage
again
having
some
difficulty
to
find
places
for
their
feet
on
account
of
the
cargo
of
melons
mcnutt
was
stowed
away
inside
with
louise
and
they
drove
away
up
the
lane
the
agent
was
jubilant
and
triumphant
and
chuckled
in
gleeful
tones
that
thrilled
the
girls
with
remorse
as
they
remembered
the
annihilation
of
mcnutt
cherished
melons
ol
dan
has
a
dorg
said
peggy
between
his
fits
of
laughter
but
i
guess
he
had

chained

not
positively

that

retorted

the

declared
the
little
man
confidently
after
wandering
around
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
allay
suspicion
beth
finally
drew
up
before
mcnutt
house
again
i
jest

peggy
as

or
perhaps
i
kin
sell

sam
cotting
he
took
rather
more
than
his
share
of
the
spoils
but
the
girls
had
no
voice
to
object
they
were
by
this
time
so
convulsed
with
suppressed
merriment
that
they
had
hard
work
not
to
shriek
aloud
their
laughter
for
in
spite
of
the
tragic
revelations
the
morrow
would
bring
forth
the
situation
was
so
undeniably
ridiculous
that
they
could
not

its

mcnutt
good
night
and
it
was
not
until
well
on
their
journey
to
the
farm
that
the
girls
finally
dared
to
abandon
further
restraint
then
indeed
they
made
the
grim
black
hills
of
the
plateau
resound
to
the
peals
of
their
merry
laughter
chapter
xxv
good
news
at
last
it
was
on
the
morning
following
this
adventure
that
uncle
john
received
a
bulky
envelope
from
the
city
containing
the
result
of
the
investigation
he
had
ordered
regarding
the
ownership
of
the
bogue
tract
of
pine
forest
it
appeared
that
the
company
in
which
he
was
so
largely
interested
had
found
the
tract
very
valuable
and
had
been
seeking
for
the
owners
in
order
to
purchase
it
or
lease
the
right
to
cut
the
timber
but
although
they
had
traced
it
through
the
hands
of
several
successive
owners
the
present
holders
were
all
unknown
to
them
until
information
had
furnished
them
with
a
clue
a
year
ago
the
company
had
paid
up
the
back
taxes
two
years
overdue
in
order
to
establish
a
claim
to
the
property
and
now
they
easily
succeeded
in
finding
the
record
of
the
deed
from
a
certain
charles
walton
to
jonas
wegg
and
william
thompson
the
deed
itself
could
not
be
found
but
uncle
john
considered
the
county
record
a
sufficient
claim
to
entitle
the
young
folks
to
the
property
unless
the
ownership
should
be
contested
by
others
which
was
not
likely
uncle
john
invited
ethel
and
joe
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
and
mary
was
told
the
occasion
merited
the
best
menu
she
could
provide
the
young
folks
arrived
without
any
idea
of
receiving
more
than
a
good
dinner
and
the
pleasure
of
mingling
with
the
cordial
kindly
household
at
the
farm
but
the
general
air
of
hilarity
and
good
fellowship
pervading
the
family
circle
this
evening
inspired
the
guests
with
like
enthusiasm
and
no
party
could
be
merrier
than
the
one
that
did
full
justice
to
superior
cookery
one
of
the
last
courses
consisted
of
iced
watermelon
and
when
it
appeared
the
three
girls
eyed
one
another
guiltily
and
then
made
frantic
attempts
to
suppress
their
laughter
which
was
unseemly
because
no
one
but
themselves
understood
the
joke
but
all
else
was
speedily
forgotten
in
the
interest
of
the
coming
ceremony
which
merrick
had
carefully
planned
and
prepared
the
company
was
invited
to
assemble
in
the
room
comprising
the
spacious
right
wing
and
when
all
were
seated
the
little
gentleman
coughed
to
clear
his
throat
and
straightway
began
his
preamble
he
recited
the
manner
in
which
captain
wegg
and
will
thompson
having
money
to
invest
were
led
into
an
enterprise
which
bob
west
had
proposed
but
finally
preferred
another
venture
and
so
withdrew
their
money
altogether
from
the
almaquo
tract
this
statement
caused
both
joe
and
ethel
to
stare
hard
but
they
said
nothing
your
grandfather
ethel
continued
the
narrator
was
much
impressed
by
the
value
of
another
timber
tract
although
where
he
got
his
information
concerning
it
i
have
been
unable
to
discover
this
piece
of
property
called
the
bogue
tract
was
purchased
by
wegg
and
thompson
with
the
money
they
withdrew
from
almaquo
and
still
stands
in
their
name
then
he
recounted
quite
frankly
his
unjust
suspicions
of
the
hardware
dealer
and
told
of
the
interview
in
which
the
full
details
of
this
transaction
were
disclosed
by
west
as
well
as
the
truth
relating
to
the
death
of
captain
wegg
and
the
sudden
insanity
and
paralysis
of
old
will
thompson
joe
could
corroborate
this
last
and
now
understood
why
thompson
had
cried
out
that
west
good
news
had
killed
his
father
he
meant
of
course
their
narrow
escape
from
being
involved
in
west
supposed
ruin
for
at
that
time
no
one
knew
the
report
of
the
fire
was
false
finally
these
matters
being
cleared
up
uncle
john
declared
that
the
lumber
company
was
willing
to
contract
to
cut
the
timber
on
the
bogue
property
or
would
pay
a
lump
sum
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
such
title
to
the
tract
as
could
be
given
he
did
not
add
that
he
had
personally
offered
to
guarantee
the
title
that
was
an
unnecessary
bit
of
information
you
may
perhaps
imagine
the
happiness
this
announcement
gave
joe
and
ethel
they
could
scarcely
believe
the
good
news
was
true
even
when
the
kindly
old
gentleman
with
tears
in
his
eyes
congratulated
the
young
couple
on
the
fortune
in
store
for
them
the
major
followed
with
a
happy
speech
of
felicitation
and
then
the
three
girls
hugged
the
little
school
teacher
rapturously
and
told
her
how
glad
they
were
i
think
sir
said
joe
striving
to
curb
his
elation
that
it
will
be
better
in
the
end
for
us
to
accept
the
royalty
do
you
i
do
indeed
my
boy
was
the
reply
for
if
our
people
make
an
offer
for
the
land
of
two
hundred
thousand
you
may
rest
assured
it
is
worth
much
more
the
manager
has
confided
to
me
in
his
letter
that
if
we
are
obliged
to
pay
royalties
the
timber
will
cost
us
nearly
double
what
it
would
by
an
outright
purchase
of
the
tract
in
that
case
sir
began
joe
eagerly
we
will
nonsense
the
company
can
afford
the
royalty
joe
for
it
is
making
a
heap
of
money
more
than
i
wish
it
were
one
of
my
greatest
trials
is
to
take
care
of
the
money
i
already
made
and
and
he
could
do
it
at
all
without
my
help
broke
in
the
major
do
ye
hesitate
to
take
an
advantage
of
him
joseph
if
ye
can
get
it
which
i
doubt
for
merrick
is
most
disgracefully
rich
already
that
true
sighed
the
little
millionaire
so
it
will
be
a
royalty
joe
we
are
paying
the
same
percentage
to
bob
west
for
the
almaquo
tract
but
yours
is
so
much
better
that
i
am
sure
your
earnings
will
furnish
you
and
ethel
with
all
the
income
you
need
they
sat
discoursing
upon
the
happy
event
for
some
time
longer
but
joe
had
to
return
to
the
hotel
early
because
he
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
be
out
late
before
i
go
merrick
he
said
i
like
you
to
give
me
my
mother
picture
which
is
in
the
secret
drawer
of
the
cupboard
you
have
the
keys
now
and
ethel
is
curious
to
see
how
my
mother
looked
uncle
john
went
at
once
to
the
cupboard
and
unlocked
the
doors
joe
himself
pushed
the
slide
and
took
out
of
the
drawer
the
picture
which
had
lain
just
beneath
the
almaquo
stock
certificates
the
picture
was
passed
reverently
around
a
sad
little
woman
it
showed
with
appealing
eyes
and
lips
that
seemed
to
quiver
even
in
the
photograph
as
louise
held
it
in
her
hand
something
induced
her
to
turn
it
over
here
is
some
writing
upon
the
back
she
said
joe
bent
over
and
read

pressed

long
envelope
tied
with
red
tape
at

joseph

shouted
triumphantly
waving
the
envelope
over
his
head
and
then
he
read

the

of
the
ancient

softened
and
filled
with
tears
as

hugged
the

close
to
