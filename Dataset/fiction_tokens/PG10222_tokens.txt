the
pilgrims
of
new
england
a
tale
of
the
early
american
settlers
by
j
webb
author
of
etc
preface
in
the
following
story
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
illustrate
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
earliest
puritan
settlers
in
new
england
and
the
trials
and
difficulties
to
which
they
were
subjected
during
the
first
years
of
their
residence
in
their
adopted
country
all
the
principal
incidents
that
are
woven
into
the
narrative
are
strictly
historical
and
are
derived
from
authentic
sources
which
give
an
impartial
picture
both
of
the
virtues
and
the
failings
of
these
remarkable
emigrants
unhappily
some
of
these
incidents
prove
but
too
clearly
how
soon
many
of
these
exiles
conscience
sake
forgot
to
practice
those
principles
of
religious
liberty
and
toleration
for
the
preservation
and
enjoyment
of
which
they
had
themselves
abandoned
home
and
kindred
and
the
church
of
their
forefathers
and
they
tend
to
lessen
the
feelings
of
respect
and
admiration
with
which
their
piety
and
their
disinterested
spirit
must
necessarily
inspire
us
we
can
not
but
regret
to
find
how
early
in
many
of
the
puritan
communities
that
piety
became
tinged
with
fanaticism
and
that
free
spirit
degenerated
into
bigotry
and
intolerance
in
their
treatment
of
others
who
had
an
equal
claim
with
themselves
to
a
freedom
of
private
judgement
and
to
the
adoption
or
rejection
of
any
peculiar
forms
or
mode
of
discipline
it
is
hoped
that
a
story
founded
on
the
history
of
these
admirable
but
sometimes
misguided
men
may
prove
interesting
to
many
who
have
hitherto
been
but
slightly
acquainted
with
the
fate
of
their
exiled
countrymen
and
may
tend
to
remove
the
prejudice
with
which
in
many
minds
they
are
regarded
for
while
we
remember
their
errors
and
infirmities
we
should
also
remember
that
their
faults
were
essentially
those
of
the
age
in
which
they
lived
and
the
education
they
had
received
while
their
virtues
were
derived
from
the
pure
faith
that
they
possessed
and
which
was
dearer
to
them
than
aught

earth

chapter
i
breaking
waves
dashed
high
on
a
stern
and
coast
and
the
woods
against
a
stormy
sky
their
giant
branches
tost
and
the
heavy
night
hung
dark
the
hills
and
waters
when
a
hand
of
exiles
moored
their
bark
on
the
wild
new
england
hemans
it
was
indeed
a
and
beneath
which
the
gallant
little
mayflower
furled
her
tattered
sails
and
dropped
her
anchor
on
the
evening
of
the
eleventh
of
november
in
the
year
the
shores
of
new
england
had
been
for
several
days
dimly
descried
by
her
passengers
through
the
gloomy
mists
that
hung
over
the
dreary
and
uncultivated
tract
of
land
towards
which
their
prow
was
turned
but
the
heavy
sea
that
dashed
against
the
rocks
the
ignorance
of
the
captain
and
his
crew
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
coast
and
the
crazy
state
of
the
vessel
had
hitherto
prevented
their
making
the
land
at
length
the
ship
was
safely
moored
in
a
small
inlet
beyond
the
reach
of
the
foaming
breakers
and
the
pilgrim
fathers
hastened
to
leave
the
vessel
in
which
they
had
so
long
been
imprisoned
and
with
their
families
to
set
foot
on
the
land
that
was
henceforth
to
be
their
home
cold
indeed
was
the
welcome
which
they
received
from
their
adopted
country
and
cheerless
was
the
view
that
met
their
gaze
as
they
landed
on
a
massy
rock
of
granite
at
the
foot
of
a
precipitous
cliff
and
looked
along
the
barren
inhospitable
shore
and
over
the
dark
waters
which
they
had
so
lately
crossed
but
hope
was
strong
in
the
hearts
of
these
exiles
and
the
faith
that
had
led
them
to
seek
these
untrodden
shores
had
not
deserted
them
during
their
long
and
tempestuous
voyage
and
they
looked
upward
through
the
gloom
and
dreariness
that
surrounded
them
and
fixed
their
trusting
eyes
on
him
who
had
guided
them
in
safety
over
the
great
deep
and
brought
them
at
length
to
a
their
first
act
was
to
kneel
down
on
the
cold
rock
and
offer
up
their
prayers
and
praises
to
that
god
for
whose
sake
they
had
given
up
country
and
friends
and
home
and
to
whose
service
they
now
dedicated
themselves
and
their
children
and
strikingly
grand
must
have
been
that
act
of
worship
the
manly
voices
of
the
sturdy
pilgrims
rose
in
deep
and
solemn
unison
followed
by
those
of
the
women
and
children
and
resounded
along
the
silent
coast
while
the
heavy
urges
of
the
receding
tide
kept
up
a
hoarse
and
monotonous
accompaniment
then
arose
a
hymn
of
thanksgiving
and
the
rocks
and
the
neighboring
hills
the
exulting
strain
that
seemed
to
drown
the
voices
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
and
to
rise
unmixed
to
heaven
it
was
the
triumph
of
faith
the
holy
and
heartfelt
expression
of
undying
trust
and
confidence
in
god
surely
at
that
time
the
pilgrims
were
meet
objects
for
the
admiring
gaze
of
men
and
angels
but
they
were
not
always
so
it
was
on
the
shore
of
cape
cod
bay
that
the
new
settlers
had
landed
in
the
inlet
now
called
new
plymouth
harbor
but
this
was
not
the
place
of
their
original
destination
they
had
intended
to
steer
for
the
mouth
of
hudson
river
and
to
have
fixed
their
habitation
in
that
less
exposed
and
inhospitable
district
but
the
dutch
had
already
conceived
the
project
which
they
afterwards
accomplished
of
settling
in
that
part
of
the
new
continent
and
it
is
supposed
that
the
captain
of
the
mayflower
was
bribed
by
them
to
convey
the
english
emigrants
further
to
the
north
so
that
the
first
american
land
which
they
beheld
was
cape
cod
they
found
that
the
place
where
they
had
landed
was
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
territory
which
had
been
granted
to
them
and
even
beyond
that
of
the
company
from
which
they
derived
their
right
of
colonization
and
after
exploring
hastily
the
neighboring
coast
and
finding
it
dreary
and
unpromising
they
again
embarked
and
insisted
on
the
captain
conveying
them
to
the
district
which
they
had
first
desired
to
reach
they
sailed
to
the
south
and
many
days
were
lost
in
endeavoring
to
find
a
more
convenient
spot
for
their
settlement
but
it
was
in
vain
the
shoals
and
the
breakers
with
which
the
coast
was
lined
presented
obstacles
that
were
insurmountable
at
that
advanced
and
unusually
inclement
season
and
weary
and
disheartened
they
returned
to
the
place
of
their
first
landing
there
they
fixed
their
abode
and
there
they
founded
the
infant
city
of
new
plymouth
it
was
a
desolate
situation
and
one
that
subjected
the
new
settlers
to
many
trials
and
privations
for
the
nearest
english
settlements
then
established
were
upwards
of
five
hundred
miles
distant
winter
having
set
in
with
more
than
common
severity
they
felt
that
no
more
time
could
be
wasted
in
seeking
for
a
better
spot
on
which
to
build
their
first
american
habitations
sickness
also
had
begun
to
show
itself
among
the
little
band
of
men
women
and
children
who
were
all
unaccustomed
to
the
hardships
and
confinement
of
a
long
voyage
and
it
was
necessary
to
disembark
with
all
possible
speed
and
erect
huts
to
shelter
them
from
the
daily
increasing
inclemency
of
the
weather
for
this
purpose
the
forests
of
oak
pine
juniper
and
sassafras
that
had
grown
undisturbed
for
centuries
along
the
coast
furnished
them
with
abundant
materials
and
the
woods
soon
echoed
to
the
unaccustomed
sound
of
the
hatchet
and
the
saw
at
which
all
the
men
of
every
rank
and
condition
labored
unremittingly
while
the
women
and
children
gathered
up
the
great
muscles
and
other
which
abounded
on
the
shore
and
collected
dry
wood
for
firing
but
before
we
follow
the
settlers
in
the
detail
of
their
sufferings
and
trials
and
of
their
ultimate
success
and
prosperity
it
will
be
needful
to
go
back
a
few
years
and
consider
the
motives
that
led
these
brave
men
to
expose
themselves
and
their
families
to
such
severe
hardships
and
to
abandon
their
home
and
their
kindred
a
brief
glance
at
their
previous
history
will
suffice
for
this
purpose
it
is
well
known
that
the
puritans
were
greatly
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
the
church
in
england
at
the
time
when
james
the
first
ascended
the
throne
of
this
country
from
him
they
hoped
for
protection
and
encouragement
but
in
this
expectation
they
were
grievously
disappointed
the
conference
at
hampton
court
proved
how
little
sympathy
he
entertained
for
their
party
and
the
convocation
which
was
held
soon
after
utterly
all
their
hopes
already
a
considerable
number
of
these
dissenters
had
joined
themselves
into
what
they
called
a
estate
pledged
to
walk
in
god
ways
and
to
renounce
the
evil
passions
of
the
world
they
had
protested
against
the
episcopal
form
of
church
government
and
declared
their
approval
of
the
discipline
and
the
forms
adopted
by
the
church
of
geneva
and
also
of
that
established
in
the
netherlands
in
order
to
enjoy
the
liberty
in
ecclesiastical
matters
which
they
so
greatly
desired
they
made
up
their
minds
to
retire
to
amsterdam
under
their
excellent
and
respected
pastor
john
robinson
and
this
project
was
effected
by
the
greater
number
of
their
party
though
some
were
discovered
before
they
could
embark
and
were
detained
and
imprisoned
and
treated
with
much
severity
ultimately
however
they
all
escaped
and
remained
unmolested
at
amsterdam
and
the
hague
until
the
year
when
they
removed
to
leyden
with
their
pastor
where
they
resided
for
eleven
years
and
were
joined
by
many
others
who
fled
from
england
during
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
james
these
men
now
felt
that
their
only
hope
of
enjoying
perfect
religious
liberty
and
of
establishing
a
church
according
to
their
own
loved
principles
lay
in
a
voluntary
exile
their
english
prejudices
made
them
shrink
from
continuing
to
dwell
among
the
dutch
who
had
hitherto
given
them
a
hospitable
asylum
for
they
feared
that
by
frequent
intermarriages
they
should
eventually
lose
their
nationality
and
they
resolved
to
seek
a
new
home
where
they
might
found
an
english
colony
and
while
they
followed
that
mode
of
worship
which
was
alone
consistent
with
their
views
and
principles
might
still
be
subjects
of
the
english
crown
and
keep
up
an
intercourse
with
the
friends
they
dearly
loved
and
the
land
where
their
forefathers
had
lived
and
died
the
recent
discovery
of
the
vast
continent
of
america
in
several
parts
of
which
the
british
had
already
begun
to
form
colonies
opened
to
them
a
field
of
enterprise
as
well
as
a
quiet
refuge
from
persecution
and
controversy
and
thither
the
puritans
turned
their
eyes
nor
were
they
the
first
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
unoccupied
wastes
of
the
new
world
and
sought
in
them
an
asylum
from
intolerant
oppression
already
a
numerous
band
of
french
huguenots
had
retired
thither
under
the
conduct
of
their
celebrated
calvinistic
leader
de
monts
who
was
invested
with
the
government
of
the
district
lying
between
montreal
and
philadelphia
by
a
patent
from
his
sovereign
henry
the
fourth
no
traces
of
this
colony
now
remain
while
those
planted
by
the
english
puritans
have
taken
root
in
the
american
soil
and
flourished
so
greatly
that
a
few
years
ago
their
descendants
were
found
to
amount
to
so
remarkably
has
the
blessing
of
god
at
least
in
temporal
matters
been
bestowed
on
an
enterprise
which
was
doubtless
undertaken
in
dependence
on
his
protection
and
was
carried
out
with
that
fortitude
and
resolution
which
are
the
results
of
sincere
piety
struggling
with
deep
adversity
footnote
for
this
account
of
the
cause
which
led
to
the
emigration
of
the
puritans
and
the
manner
in
which
they
effected
it
the
authoress
is
chiefly
indebted
to
of
the
puritans
and
of
the
colonization
of
the
idea
of
retiring
to
the
shores
of
america
was
first
suggested
to
his
followers
by
their
pastor
john
robinson
whose
influence
over
his
flock
was
almost
unexampled
this
influence
was
derived
from
the
purity
of
his
life
and
the
holy
consistency
of
his
conduct
he
was
possessed
of
a
gentle
temper
and
the
strictness
of
his
religious
principles
was
united
with
a
spirit
of
toleration
towards
others
which
was
too
little
felt
or
practiced
in
those
days
and
which
was
not
as
is
too
often
the
case
changed
into
bitterness
by
the
sufferings
that
he
had
himself
experienced
well
had
it
been
for
those
who
professed
to
be
guided
by
his
example
and
advice
and
who
left
the
shores
of
europe
with
the
sanction
of
his
counsel
and
his
blessing
if
they
had
carried
with
them
the
truly
christian
spirit
of
their
respected
minister
and
had
suffered
that
spirit
to
guide
them
in
the
formation
and
during
the
growth
of
their
infant
church
in
america
but
as
we
shall
presently
see
this
was
not
the
case
the
mercy
and
toleration
which
the
puritan
exiles
had
vainly
asked
at
the
hands
of
their
brethren
at
home
they
denied
to
others
who
differed
from
them
and
consequently
while
they
have
so
greatly
prospered
in
the
things
of
this
world
in
religion
they
have
evidently
declined
emigration
being
resolved
on
the
first
step
that
was
taken
by
the
puritans
was
an
application
to
king
james
for
an
assurance
of
protection
and
toleration
in
the
new
home
which
they
desired
to
seek
but
this
was
more
than
the
wary
king
would
guarantee
to
them
all
that
they
could
obtain
was
a
vague
promise
that
so
long
as
they
conducted
themselves
peaceably
they
should
not
be
molested
and
relying
on
this
promise
they
immediately
commenced
a
negotiation
with
the
virginian
company
for
the
possession
of
a
tract
of
land
within
the
limits
of
the
patent
which
had
been
granted
to
them
for
colonizing
that
part
of
america
this
was
easily
obtained
for
the
society
had
hitherto
only
been
able
to
occupy
a
few
isolated
spots
of
their
extensive
territory
and
therefore
were
willing
to
encourage
fresh
settlers
the
congregation
over
which
robinson
presided
amounted
at
the
time
of
their
intended
emigration
to
upwards
of
three
hundred
in
number
but
their
resources
were
inadequate
to
the
expense
of
moving
all
together
and
it
was
therefore
arranged
that
only
a
part
of
the
flock
should
sail
at
first
under
the
guidance
of
william
brewster
while
the
rest
should
remain
at
leyden
under
the
care
of
their
pastor
and
wait
for
the
report
of
their
friends
before
they
followed
them
to
their
chosen
place
of
exile
the
names
of
the
vessels
which
were
engaged
to
convey
the
pilgrims
from
the
shores
of
europe
were
the
mayflower
and
the
speedwell
names
still
cherished
by
heir
descendants
when
they
were
ready
for
sea
the
whole
congregation
assembled
themselves
together
and
observed
a
solemn
fast
which
concluded
with
prayer
and
robinson
preached
to
them
from
ezra
viii
i
proclaimed
a
fast
there
at
the
river
of
ahava
that
we
might
afflict
ourselves
before
our
god
to
seek
of
him
a
right
way
for
us
and
for
our
little
ones
and
for
all
our
substance
he
afterwards
addressed
them
in
a
deeply
impressive
speech
in
which
he
earnestly
deprecated
all
party
spirit
and
bigotry
and
exhorted
them
to
be
guided
only
by
the
pure
doctrines
of
god
word
charge
you
said
this
truly
christian
and
evangelical
minister
you
follow
me
no
further
than
you
have
seen
me
follow
the
lord
jesus
christ
the
lord
has
more
truth
yet
to
break
forth
out
of
his
holy
word
i
can
not
sufficiently
bewail
the
condition
of
the
reformed
churches
which
are
come
to
a
period
in
religion
and
will
go
at
present
no
further
than
the
instruments
of
their
reformation
luther
and
calvin
were
great
and
shining
lights
in
their
times
yet
they
penetrated
not
into
the
whole
counsel
of
god
the
lutherans
can
not
be
drawn
to
go
beyond
what
luther
saw
and
the
calvinists
you
see
stick
fast
where
they
were
left
by
that
great
man
of
god
i
beseech
you
remember
it
is
an
article
of
your
church
covenant
that
you
shall
be
ready
to
receive
whatever
truth
shall
be
made
known
to
you

the
congregation
then
repaired
to
the
house
of
their
pastor
and
partook
of
a
farewell
repast
together
after
which
they
proceeded
to
delft
harbor
and
there
the
pilgrims
embarked
again
their
minister
offered
up
fervent
prayer
in
behalf
of
this
portion
of
his
flock
who
were
about
to
encounter
the
dangers
of
a
long
voyage
and
to
seek
a
home
in
an
almost
unknown
land
and
then
in
deep
silence
they
parted
cheers
or
noisy
acclamations
resounded
along
the
shore
for
such
demonstrations
were
little
in
accordance
with
the
usual
serious
habits
of
the
puritans
and
still
less
so
with
the
feelings
of
sadness
which
now
oppressed
their
hearts
but
a
volley
of
small
shot
and
three
pieces
of
ordnance
writes
winslow
one
of
the
emigrants
to
those
on
shore
the
hearty
courage
and
affectionate
adieus
of
those
on
board
and
so
lifting
up
our
hands
to
one
another
and
our
hearts
to
the
lord
we
departed
thus
the
pilgrims
set
sail
with
mingled
feelings
of
hope
for
the
future
and
regret
for
what
they
left
behind
and
greatly
would
their
sorrow
have
been
increased
had
they
known
that
they
would
never
again
behold
on
earth
the
countenance
of
their
pastor
they
fully
anticipated
his
following
them
with
the
rest
of
their
brethren
as
soon
as
they
should
have
found
a
suitable
place
of
settlement
for
the
whole
congregation
but
poverty
and
other
obstacles
detained
him
in
europe
and
he
terminated
his
useful
and
exemplary
life
at
leyden
the
emigrants
had
not
proceeded
far
on
their
voyage
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
mayflower
commanded
by
captain
jones
was
in
need
of
some
repairs
and
the
two
vessels
put
into
dartmouth
not
to
sail
together
again
the
captain
of
the
speedwell
declared
that
he
was
afraid
to
encounter
the
voyage
and
from
this
or
some
other
motive
he
positively
refused
to
proceed
any
further
several
of
the
passengers
also
had
already
begun
to
feel
disheartened
and
they
returned
with
him
to
london
and
abandoned
the
enterprise
altogether
doubtless
the
pilgrims
bad
no
cause
to
lament
the
departure
of
these
comrades
but
it
occasioned
them
much
present
inconvenience
for
not
being
able
to
procure
another
vessel
to
convey
the
remainder
of
the
passengers
who
had
embarked
in
the
speedwell
they
were
all
obliged
to
be
crowded
into
the
mayflower
which
sailed
again
on
the
sixth
of
september
with
considerably
upwards
of
a
hundred
men
women
and
children
on
her
narrow
decks
in
addition
to
her
own
crew
of
seamen
after
a
very
tedious
and
tempestuous
voyage
they
came
in
sight
of
the
american
shores
on
the
eighth
of
november
and
as
we
have
already
seen
they
landed
three
days
afterwards
in
cape
cod
bay
and
eventually
founded
the
city
of
new
plymouth
at
the
place
of
their
disembarkation
a
portion
of
the
granite
rock
on
which
the
pilgrim
fathers
first
set
foot
has
since
been
removed
from
the
coast
and
placed
in
front
pilgrim
hall
enclosed
in
an
iron
railing
and
the
anniversary
of
their
landing
afterwards
called
has
ever
since
been
observed
by
their
descendants
as
a
day
of
solemn
festivity
in
remembrance
of
the
mercy
of
providence
which
led
them
safely
through
so
many
difficulties
and
dangers
and
permitted
them
to
find
a
new
home
and
a
new
country
and
to
bring
their
enterprise
to
such
a
prosperous
issue
it
is
with
the
first
period
of
their
establishment
on
the
uncultivated
shores
of
north
america
that
our
story
commences
and
it
is
connected
with
the
sufferings
and
privations
which
were
so
patiently
endured
and
the
difficulties
which
were
so
resolutely
overcome
by
these
devoted
men
before
they
had
taken
root
in
their
new
settlement
or
gathered
around
themselves
and
their
families
the
comforts
which
they
had
abandoned
in
their
own
land
for
conscience
sake
many
trials
awaited
them
ere
prosperity
became
their
portion
and
ere
they
could
feel
either
rest
or
security
in
the
wild
regions
where
they
had
sought
a
refuge
and
these
trials
will
be
brought
more
distinctly
to
our
minds
if
we
view
them
in
connection
with
some
of
the
individuals
of
the
expedition
and
follow
the
fortunes
of
one
family
more
particularly
this
family
we
will
call
by
the
name
of
maitland
and
endeavor
in
their
somewhat
imaginary
history
to
describe
the
mode
of
life
and
some
of
the
joys
and
sorrows
the
difficulties
and
successes
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
owing
to
the
many
delays
which
the
emigrants
had
experienced
a
severe
winter
had
set
in
before
they
landed
and
had
fixed
a
spot
for
their
permanent
abode
and
they
found
themselves
exposed
to
the
inclemency
of
a
north
climate
with
no
other
shelter
than
a
few
tents
besides
that
which
the
vessel
continued
to
afford
in
haste
they
felled
the
trees
of
the
neighboring
forests
and
in
haste
they
constructed
the
village
of
log
huts
which
was
to
be
their
present
abode
and
which
ultimately
grew
into
the
flourishing
and
wealthy
city
of
new
plymouth
in
the
erection
of
this
hamlet
no
head
was
so
fertile
in
plans
and
expedients
and
no
arms
were
so
strong
to
execute
them
as
those
of
rodolph
maitland
the
head
of
the
family
in
whom
we
are
specially
interested
he
was
a
younger
member
of
a
very
respectable
family
in
the
north
of
england
and
had
passed
his
youth
and
early
manhood
in
the
service
of
his
country
as
a
soldier
this
profession
however
became
distasteful
to
him
when
the
religious
dissensions
which
troubled
the
land
called
on
him
at
times
to
obey
his
commander
in
carrying
out
schemes
of
oppression
which
were
contrary
both
to
his
feelings
and
his
principles
his
marriage
with
helen
seatown
the
daughter
of
a
nonconforming
minister
increased
his
repugnance
to
bearing
arms
which
might
be
turned
against
the
party
to
which
he
was
now
so
closely
connected
and
he
threw
up
his
commission
and
soon
afterwards
accompanied
his
to
holland
and
joined
the
congregation
of
the
respected
robinson
at
leyden
here
he
continued
to
reside
until
the
resolution
to
emigrate
was
formed
by
the
puritan
refugees
when
he
was
among
the
first
to
embrace
the
proposition
of
the
pastor
and
to
lend
all
the
aid
which
his
comparative
wealth
and
the
influence
of
his
connections
in
england
enabled
him
to
offer
in
furtherance
of
the
enterprise
his
law
had
died
soon
after
his
arrival
at
leyden
but
his
amiable
and
devoted
wife
was
most
willing
to
follow
him
in
his
voluntary
exile
and
to
take
her
children
to
the
new
world
where
she
hoped
to
bring
them
up
in
the
same
principles
of
pure
evangelical
religion
which
she
had
learnt
from
her
own
parents
and
which
were
dearer
to
her
than
home
or
friends
or
aught
on
earth
besides
at
the
time
when
the
pilgrims
reached
america
the
family
consisted
of
two
sons
henrich
and
ludovico
the
elder
of
whom
was
sixteen
years
of
age
and
the
younger
about
seven
and
one
little
girl
between
ten
and
eleven
named
edith
in
the
thoughtful
seriousness
of
his
eldest
boy
which
was
united
with
great
intelligence
and
spirit
and
a
manly
resolution
beyond
his
years
rodolph
saw
his
own
character
again
depicted
and
helen
proudly
hoped
that
her
henrich
would
one
day
manifest
all
those
qualities
of
mind
and
person
by
which
his
father
had
first
won
her
admiration
and
love
and
by
which
he
had
since
gained
the
esteem
and
affection
of
all
who
were
in
any
way
connected
with
him
henrich
was
now
old
enough
to
understand
and
almost
to
appreciate
the
motives
which
had
induced
his
parents
and
their
companions
to
become
exiles
from
home
and
his
young
heart
exulted
in
the
resolution
that
freed
him
from
the
cold
formality
of
dutch
manners
and
opened
to
his
adventurous
spirit
a
prospect
of
liberty
and
enterprise
far
better
suited
to
his
inclination
and
character
religious
freedom
he
desired
because
he
had
been
taught
that
it
was
his
rightful
privilege
and
that
the
want
of
it
had
occasioned
those
troubles
which
first
drove
his
parents
and
friends
from
their
native
land
but
personal
freedom
he
yearned
for
with
his
whole
soul
and
the
wild
shores
of
new
england
and
the
depths
of
the
unexplored
forests
that
now
met
his
eager
gaze
filled
his
ardent
mind
with
anticipations
of
adventurous
joys
hitherto
unknown
to
him
these
anticipations
were
destined
to
be
fulfilled
ere
long
in
a
manner
which
he
neither
foresaw
nor
desired
his
brother
ludovico
was
a
playful
child
too
young
to
share
all
the
feelings
of
the
earnest
henrich
who
always
acted
as
his
guide
and
protector
during
their
sports
and
rambles
but
in
the
gentle
little
edith
he
found
a
kindred
spirit
and
a
heart
that
could
sympathize
in
all
his
joys
and
sorrows
young
as
she
was
edith
felt
the
influence
of
her
brother
character
and
she
looked
up
to
him
with
feelings
of
devoted
love
and
admiring
pride
she
was
his
constant
companion
and
his
assistant
in
all
his
difficulties
this
had
been
very
much
the
case
during
their
residence
in
holland
but
on
their
arrival
in
new
england
edith
was
left
still
more
to
her
brother
guidance
their
parents
were
necessarily
too
much
occupied
with
the
cares
end
anxieties
which
their
new
situation
brought
upon
them
to
devote
much
time
to
their
children
and
when
the
light
labors
in
which
henrich
and
edith
were
able
to
render
any
assistance
were
over
they
and
ludovico
amused
themselves
by
wandering
along
the
shore
in
search
of
shells
and
seaweed
or
else
they
followed
the
into
the
forest
to
seek
for
such
flowering
plants
as
still
were
to
be
found
in
the
more
sheltered
spots
and
to
transplant
them
to
the
garden
that
was
to
surround
and
embellish
their
rude
dwelling
as
soon
as
a
tolerable
shelter
had
been
obtained
by
the
erection
of
a
sufficient
number
of
to
contain
the
families
of
the
settlers
it
was
resolved
that
a
party
of
men
should
go
on
an
exploring
expedition
and
endeavor
to
ascertain
the
nature
and
resources
of
the
coast
on
which
they
had
landed
and
also
whether
it
was
inhabited
by
any
tribes
of
native
indians
hitherto
they
had
seen
no
human
beings
and
they
had
remained
undisturbed
possessors
of
the
soil
but
they
could
hardly
expect
that
this
state
of
things
would
long
continue
and
they
were
anxious
if
possible
to
discover
the
native
inhabitants
and
natural
possessors
of
the
country
and
to
establish
friendly
relations
with
them
sixteen
of
the
pilgrims
volunteered
for
this
expedition
headed
by
rodolph
maitland
whose
military
experience
and
superior
intelligence
well
fitted
him
to
be
the
leader
of
the
party
the
rest
of
the
men
remained
to
protect
their
families
and
to
complete
the
village
which
already
presented
a
very
respectable
appearance
and
promised
to
afford
a
tolerably
comfortable
residence
to
the
new
settlers
until
they
should
have
leisure
and
means
to
erect
dwellings
more
in
accordance
with
their
previous
habits
of
life
the
government
of
the
little
colony
was
unanimously
confided
to
john
carver
who
was
elected
president
for
one
year
but
he
did
not
live
long
to
exercise
his
authority
or
to
enjoy
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
by
his
during
the
short
period
however
that
he
was
spared
to
them
he
exerted
himself
successfully
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
to
preserve
peace
and
unanimity
among
the
members
of
which
it
was
composed
and
before
the
departure
of
the
exploring
party
he
called
on
all
the
pilgrim
fathers
to
sign
a
covenant
which
had
been
drawn
up
during
the
voyage
and
which
contained
a
statement
of
the
peculiar
religious
principles
of
the
congregation
and
also
of
the
mode
of
civil
government
that
they
proposed
to
establish
in
the
colony
this
government
was
not
to
be
independent
of
the
mother
country
for
the
pilgrims
regarded
themselves
as
still
being
the
subjects
of
king
james
and
the
patent
which
they
had
procured
to
enable
them
to
settle
in
new
england
was
granted
by
the
company
to
whom
the
king
had
assigned
the
right
of
colonizing
that
part
of
north
america
they
therefore
intended
to
be
governed
mainly
by
english
laws
and
to
keep
up
a
constant
and
intimate
connection
with
their
english
brethren
it
may
be
well
here
to
mention
that
their
plan
of
civil
government
consisted
in
the
election
of
a
governor
or
president
by
general
vote
and
of
seven
counselors
to
assist
him
the
only
privilege
granted
to
the
president
being
that
his
vote
counted
double
this
state
of
things
continued
for
eighteen
years
after
which
time
the
growth
of
the
colony
rendered
a
change
expedient
and
each
new
town
that
was
founded
sent
delegates
to
a
general
court
it
would
however
be
useless
here
to
follow
the
political
changes
of
these
early
settlers
as
it
is
only
with
their
first
form
of
government
that
our
story
is
concerned
according
to
the
habitual
custom
of
the
pilgrims
the
sabbath
which
preceded
the
sending
forth
this
band
of
spies
to
search
the
land
was
observed
with
the
utmost
solemnity
for
no
press
of
occupations
no
necessity
for
haste
ever
induced
them
to
neglect
this
duty
for
the
liberty
of
practicing
their
own
mode
of
worship
they
had
sought
these
shores
and
having
been
permitted
safely
to
reach
them
they
used
that
liberty
and
were
never
unmindful
of
their
religious
privileges
every
sabbath
was
a
day
of
sacred
rest
and
every
undertaking
was
sanctified
by
prayer
sometimes
even
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
when
the
undertaking
was
such
as
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
deserve
the
blessing
of
god
still
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
their
piety
as
a
body
was
sincere
and
while
we
condemn
the
sternness
and
severity
into
which
they
were
too
frequently
betrayed
we
must
yield
our
heartfelt
approbation
to
the
resolution
and
unflinching
faith
that
were
their
governing
principle
and
their
actuating
motive
well
have
these
principles
and
motives
been
described
by
a
late
poet
and
well
may
we
conclude
this
introductory
chapter
with
the
last
verse
of
that
exquisite
song
with
the
first
of
which
we
commenced
it
sought
they
thus
afar
bright
jewels
of
the
mine
the
wealth
of
seas
the
spoils
of
war
they
sought
a
faith
pure
shrine
aye

the
soil
where
first
they
trod
they
have
left
unstain
what

and

his
presence
in
the
vast
and
dim
and
whispering
woods
where
dying
thunders
roll
from
the
far
hemans
with
some
anxiety
the
settlers
saw
the
exploring
party
set
out
on
their
hazardous
enterprise
the
season
was
far
advanced
and
drifting
snowstorms
gave
warning
of
the
inclement
winter
that
was
rapidly
setting
in
still
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
make
some
investigation
into
the
nature
of
the
country
and
to
endeavor
to
obtain
if
possible
a
supply
of
provisions
before
the
increasing
severity
of
the
weather
should
render
it
impracticable
to
do
so
but
above
all
it
was
desirable
to
ascertain
what
native
tribes
dwelt
in
the
vicinity
of
the
settlement
and
to
use
every
means
to
establish
friendly
relations
with
them
not
only
because
such
a
course
would
be
most
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
the
gospel
which
the
emigrants
professed
to
hold
and
to
practice
but
also
because
in
the
present
state
of
the
infant
colony
they
were
altogether
unprepared
to
resist
any
attack
that
might
be
made
on
them
by
a
large
body
of
indians
maitland
led
his
party
inland
at
first
and
for
two
days
they
saw
no
traces
or
human
inhabitants
but
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
as
they
were
looking
about
for
a
convenient
spot
on
which
to
encamp
for
the
night
some
large
and
apparently
artificial
mounds
of
earth
were
observed
scattered
over
an
open
glade
in
the
forest
at
the
first
glance
they
appeared
like
dwelling
places
and
knowing
something
of
the
habits
of
the
indians
rodolph
and
two
of
his
companions
approached
them
warily
fearing
to
surprise
and
irritate
the
inhabitants
but
after
making
a
circuit
and
ascertaining
that
these
supposed
huts
had
no
doorways
they
went
up
to
them
and
found
them
to
be
solid
mounds
at
the
foot
of
which
neatly
plaited
baskets
filled
with
ears
of
maize
were
placed
these
were
eagerly
seized
upon
and
a
further
search
being
made
several
warlike
and
agricultural
implements
were
discovered
buried
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
was
evident
that
these
mounds
were
native
graves
and
that
they
had
recently
been
visited
by
the
tribe
to
which
they
belonged
who
most
probably
resided
in
the
neighborhood
therefore
to
avoid
exciting
their
displeasure
and
jealousy
rodolph
caused
all
the
weapons
and
other
tools
to
be
restored
to
their
places
and
in
exchange
for
the
corn
which
was
too
much
needed
to
be
left
behind
he
put
into
the
baskets
several
strings
of
beads
and
other
trifles
with
which
he
was
provided
for
the
purpose
of
barter
or
as
presents
to
the
natives
it
did
not
appear
either
safe
or
desirable
to
remain
near
a
spot
so
sacred
to
the
indians
the
party
therefore
moved
further
into
the
depth
of
the
forest
where
they
erected
their
tents
which
consisted
merely
of
blankets
supported
on
poles
and
lighting
large
fires
they
slept
by
turns
while
half
their
number
kept
a
vigilant
watch
their
rest
was
however
undisturbed
either
by
lurking
indians
or
by
prowling
beasts
of
prey
and
at
they
resumed
their
march
in
the
hope
of
discovering
the
native
camp
but
their
search
was
in
vain
and
rodolph
determined
to
leave
the
forest
and
return
to
the
settlement
along
the
shore
hoping
there
to
find
some
traces
of
the
natives
before
he
and
his
comrades
left
the
shelter
of
the
wood
they
fired
their
muskets
at
the
small
game
which
abounded
in
every
direction
partly
with
a
view
to
supply
themselves
with
food
and
partly
to
attract
the
notice
of
any
straggling
indians
who
might
be
wandering
near
and
who
would
conduct
them
to
their
wigwams
but
the
echoes
were
the
only
sounds
that
answered
their
reports
and
it
was
clear
that
no
native
camp
was
within
hearing
the
place
where
maitland
and
his
little
band
reached
the
coast
was
nearly
twenty
leagues
from
the
settlement
towards
the
north
and
has
since
been
known
by
the
name
of
angoum
here
they
found
two
empty
huts
containing
all
the
utensils
used
by
the
indians
of
that
trays
and
dishes
formed
of
calabashes
and
carved
wood
or
bark
and
beautiful
baskets
constructed
of
crabshells
ingeniously
wrought
together
with
mats
of
grass
and
bulrushes
dyed
of
various
brilliant
colors
the
inhabitants
had
probably
gone
on
a
fishing
expedition
and
would
return
in
a
few
days
as
they
had
left
behind
them
a
considerable
quantity
of
dried
acorns
which
at
that
period
formed
a
common
article
of
food
with
these
children
of
the
forest
rodolph
suffered
nothing
to
be
taken
from
the
huts
but
proceeded
along
the
coast
in
a
southerly
direction
and
at
length
he
perceived
two
canoes
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
shore
containing
several
indians
who
took
no
notice
of
the
signals
they
made
but
rowed
rapidly
away
on
an
opposite
course
finding
it
useless
to
linger
any
longer
in
this
part
of
the
bay
maitland
led
his
party
back
to
the
settlement
at
new
plymouth
taking
accurate
observations
of
the
line
of
coast
and
communicated
to
president
carver
all
the
information
that
he
had
been
able
to
collect
this
was
not
very
satisfactory
and
the
governor
resolved
to
send
out
a
second
party
well
armed
who
should
proceed
in
the
shallop
to
the
southern
part
of
cape
cod
bay
this
expedition
was
placed
under
the
command
of
captain
standish
who
was
regarded
as
the
military
chief
of
the
settlers
and
maitland
again
formed
one
of
the
number
on
this
occasion
he
obtained
permission
to
take
henrich
with
him
as
he
wished
the
boy
to
become
early
inured
to
the
hardships
and
privations
which
it
would
probably
be
his
lot
to
bear
for
many
years
and
also
to
acquire
habits
of
courage
and
vigilance
that
might
be
of
service
to
him
hereafter
henrich
was
delighted
with
this
arrangement
which
gratified
his
desire
for
adventure
and
also
proved
that
his
father
now
placed
some
confidence
in
him
and
no
longer
regarded
him
as
a
mere
child
his
astonishment
was
great
when
first
he
beheld
the
whales
those
huge
and
monsters
of
the
ocean
lifting
their
gigantic
heads
above
the
waves
and
lashing
the
surface
to
foam
with
their
powerful
tails
or
ejecting
vast
spouts
of
water
like
fountains
from
their
upraised
heads
these
and
many
other
strange
objects
attracted
his
attention
as
the
boat
moved
down
the
bay
but
all
were
forgotten
in
the
absorbing
interest
with
which
he
regarded
for
the
first
time
the
wild
red
men
that
met
his
view
as
the
boat
neared
the
shore
at
a
spot
about
eight
leagues
from
new
plymouth
called
by
the
pilgrims
several
of
these
savages
in
their
strange
attire
of
skins
and
feathers
and
woven
grasses
showed
themselves
among
the
rocks
that
stood
above
the
but
regardless
of
the
peaceful
signs
that
were
made
to
them
by
captain
standish
and
his
crew
they
hastily
retreated
and
when
the
party
disembarked
not
an
indian
was
to
be
seen
with
much
circumspection
the
captain
advanced
at
the
head
of
his
resolute
band
who
all
held
their
muskets
ready
for
action
if
should
compel
them
to
use
them
but
with
a
positive
order
from
their
commander
to
refrain
from
any
act
of
hostility
so
long
as
it
was
possible
to
do
so
this
command
could
not
however
be
long
obeyed
for
as
the
party
proceeded
through
the
rocks
and
stunted
trees
that
lined
the
coast
they
came
in
sight
of
a
burial
ground
similar
to
that
which
had
been
discovered
in
the
first
expedition
except
that
in
this
case
the
mounds
of
earth
were
enclosed
by
a
strong
palisade
of
upright
poles
bound
together
firmly
at
the
top
through
the
interstices
of
these
poles
standish
and
his
men
saw
the
glittering
eyes
of
the
savages
watching
their
approach
and
before
they
could
decide
whether
to
advance
or
retreat
a
shower
of
arrows
was
discharged
several
of
which
took
effect
though
not
mortally
this
wanton
aggression
roused
the
spirit
of
the
sturdy
englishmen
and
regardless
of
the
efforts
which
captain
standish
made
to
restrain
them
a
volley
of
musket
balls
instantly
replied
to
the
challenge
of
the
red
men
and
the
wild
cries
that
arose
from
the
cemetery
plainly
told
that
they
had
not
sped
in
vain
even
rodolph
maitland
was
surprised
out
of
his
usual
calm
resolution
and
presence
of
mind
for
he
saw
his
son
fall
bleeding
to
the
ground
pierced
through
the
leg
by
an
arrow
and
almost
involuntarily
he
fired
off
his
musket
at
an
indian
whose
body
was
more
exposed
than
the
rest
and
whose
greater
profusion
of
ornament
showed
him
to
be
one
of
their
chief
warriors
rodolph
saw
him
fall
from
the
palisades
on
which
he
had
climbed
to
take
a
better
aim
at
the
white
men
and
instantly
a
gate
was
opened
in
the
enclosure
and
with
a
hideous
yell
the
savages
rushed
forth
brandishing
their
spears
and
and
shouting
their
woach
ha
ha
hach
woach
their
number
appeared
to
be
about
thirty
men
and
standish
knew
that
his
party
several
of
whom
were
already
slightly
wounded
could
not
resist
the
fury
of
their
attack
he
therefore
gave
the
word
for
an
instant
retreat
to
the
boat
as
the
only
means
of
safety
his
gallant
band
would
gladly
have
pressed
on
and
met
the
savages
in
close
combat
but
they
had
promised
to
obey
their
leader
and
reluctantly
they
followed
him
to
the
shore
the
path
by
which
they
had
emerged
on
the
was
narrow
and
winding
and
they
were
soon
hidden
from
the
sight
of
the
indians
but
they
heard
their
wild
whoop
among
the
rocks
and
bushes
and
knew
that
they
were
in
eager
pursuit
maitland
had
caught
up
his
wounded
boy
in
his
arms
and
now
bore
him
rapidly
forward
but
the
weight
of
his
burden
and
the
roughness
of
the
way
retarded
his
steps
and
powerful
as
he
was
he
could
not
keep
up
with
his
comrades
who
were
unconscious
that
he
had
fallen
behind
them
he
thought
of
his
wife
of
mother
and
he
pat
forth
his
utmost
strength
still
the
war
cry
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
henrich
who
had
hitherto
uttered
no
sound
of
pain
or
word
of
complaint
exclaimed
wildly
i
see
them
there
there
they
have
entered
the
thicket
and
one
has
climbed
the
rock
and
will
soon
overtake
us
o
father
fly
for
his
is
lifted
up
and
his
eyes
glare
maitland
heart
beat
furiously
he
could
not
pause
or
turn
to
look
at
the
coming
foe
but
his
quick
and
ready
mind
was
active
in
devising
some
means
of
saving
the
life
of
his
child
my
gun
henrich
he
exclaimed
can
not
long
continue
this
speed
be
steady
and
be
quick
our
lives
depend
upon
it
the
gallant
boy
instantly
obeyed
the
difficult
command
and
the
instant
it
was
done
rodolph
dropped
on
one
knee
supported
his
bleeding
son
on
the
other
and
taking
a
deliberate
aim
at
the
indian
who
was
preparing
to
leap
from
the
rock
into
the
path
behind
them
he
fired
the
upraised
arms
of
the
savage
fell
powerless
the
heavy
axe
dropped
from
his
hand
and
falling
forward
over
the
rock
he
lay
expiring
in
the
narrow
pathway
the
feathery
coronets
of
several
of
his
comrades
were
seen
above
the
bushes
at
some
distance
and
again
the
father
raised
his
son
who
now
hung
fainting
in
his
arms
and
hurried
with
renewed
speed
towards
the
shore
as
he
neared
it
he
met
two
of
his
companions
who
having
reached
the
boat
had
missed
him
and
henrich
and
hastened
back
to
secure
their
retreat
it
was
a
seasonable
reinforcement
for
rodolph
strength
was
failing
him
he
gave
his
boy
into
the
arms
of
one
of
his
friends
and
loading
his
gun
he
stood
with
the
other
to
defend
the
passage
to
the
shore
the
savages
came
on
and
the
white
men
fired
and
retreated
loading
as
they
fell
back
and
again
firing
until
their
pursuers
either
wounded
or
disheartened
came
to
a
stand
still
and
contented
themselves
with
yelling
their
discordant
and
shooting
arrows
which
happily
missed
their
aim
the
whole
party
embarked
safely
and
were
soon
beyond
the
reach
of
the
missiles
which
the
indians
continued
to
discharge
and
maitland
had
the
joy
of
seeing
young
henrich
speedily
recover
his
senses
and
his
spirit
too
it
was
evident
that
the
arrows
used
by
the
red
men
on
this
occasion
were
not
poisoned
and
no
great
or
permanent
evil
was
likely
to
arise
from
any
of
the
wounds
received
but
a
spirit
of
hostility
had
been
established
between
the
settlers
and
the
nausett
tribe
to
which
their
assailants
belonged
and
rodolph
was
a
marked
man
and
an
object
of
determined
revenge
to
all
who
had
shared
in
the
conflict
the
spot
where
it
took
place
was
named
first
encounter
in
memory
of
the
event
and
long
retained
that
name
and
the
consequences
of
this
first
combat
proved
to
be
equally
calamitous
to
the
savages
and
to
their
more
civilized
foes
for
many
subsequent
years
the
exploring
party
returned
to
their
settlement
as
speedily
as
possible
being
anxious
to
obtain
medical
relief
for
the
wounded
helen
maitland
and
her
children
were
wandering
on
the
shore
when
the
boat
first
came
in
sight
and
for
several
evenings
the
desolate
coast
had
been
her
constant
haunt
after
the
necessary
labors
of
the
day
were
completed
it
had
been
with
much
reluctance
that
she
had
consented
to
her
husband
wish
of
taking
henrich
on
the
hazardous
expedition
and
his
being
of
the
party
had
greatly
increased
the
anxiety
and
uneasiness
which
rodolph
absence
always
caused
her
as
the
days
passed
on
this
anxiety
became
greater
and
visions
of
fatal
encounters
with
the
savages
beset
her
naturally
timid
mind
daily
therefore
she
left
her
hut
and
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
fur
with
which
her
husband
had
provided
her
before
he
brought
her
to
brave
a
north
american
winter
she
paced
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
beach
looking
out
over
the
dark
waters
and
lifting
her
heart
in
prayer
for
the
safe
and
speedy
return
of
the
wanderers
edith
and
ludovico
accompanied
her
but
they
could
not
share
her
anxiety
they
looked
indeed
with
eagerness
for
the
expected
boat
which
was
to
bring
back
their
father
and
brother
but
they
soon
forgot
the
object
of
their
search
and
amused
themselves
by
climbing
the
rocks
and
gathering
the
shells
which
the
wintry
waves
now
cast
up
in
abundance
they
were
thus
engaged
when
edith
happened
to
glance
to
the
south
and
saw
the
long
desired
coming
round
a
little
promontory
that
concealed
it
from
her
mother
as
she
walked
below
in
an
instant
the
treasure
of
shells
and
seaweed
was
forgotten
and
little
edith
was
bounding
down
to
the
beach
followed
by
ludovico
boat
mother
the
boat
she
eagerly
exclaimed
as
she
pointed
in
the
direction
in
which
it
was
approaching
and
in
another
moment
she
and
her
little
brother
were
at
helen
side
and
all
hastening
to
the
that
very
granite
rock
on
which
they
had
first
disembarked
on
the
american
shore
the
boat
came
rear
and
as
soon
as
the
crew
perceived
helen
and
the
children
on
the
rock
they
raised
a
hearty
cheer
to
tell
her
that
all
was
well
she
saw
her
husband
standing
on
the
prow
and
her
heart
bounded
with
joy
but
she
looked
for
henrich
and
she
did
not
see
him
and
fear
mingled
with
her
joy
a
few
more
strokes
of
the
oars
and
the
boat
glided
up
to
the
rock
and
rodolph
leaped
on
shore
and
embraced
his
wife
and
children
be
praised
you
are
safe
my
rodolph
exclaimed
helen
where
is
henrich
where
is
my
boy
also
is
safe
helen
his
life
is
preserved
but
he
is
wounded
and
unable
to
come
from
the
boat
to
meet
you
bear
up
he
added
seeing
that
she
trembled
violently
while
the
tears
flowed
down
her
blanched
cheeks
need
not
fear
the
brave
boy
is
maimed
indeed
but
i
trust
not
seriously
injured
he
is
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
must
not
be
agitated
therefore
meet
him
cheerfully
and
then
hasten
to
make
the
arrangements
for
his
comfort
that
your
scanty
means
will
permit
helen
dried
her
tears
and
forced
a
smile
to
greet
her
wounded
child
who
was
now
being
lifted
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
gently
carried
on
shore
by
two
of
the
men
his
pallid
countenance
and
stained
garments
struck
a
chill
to
her
heart
but
she
concealed
her
grief
and
silenced
the
sobs
and
exclamations
of
the
little
edith
and
her
terrified
brother
and
then
having
affectionately
welcomed
the
almost
fainting
boy
she
hurried
away
with
the
children
to
prepare
for
his
reception
in
the
comfortless
assisted
by
janet
the
faithful
servant
who
had
nursed
her
children
and
followed
her
from
england
to
holland
and
from
holland
to
america
she
soon
arranged
a
bed
for
their
patient
and
henrich
smiled
cheerfully
though
languidly
when
he
found
himself
again
beneath
the
humble
roof
that
was
now
his
home
and
surrounded
by
all
whom
he
loved
his
wound
proved
to
be
a
severe
one
more
so
than
his
father
had
imagined
and
the
loss
of
blood
had
been
so
considerable
that
he
was
reduced
to
extreme
weakness
now
it
was
that
helen
felt
the
absence
of
all
the
comforts
and
even
luxuries
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
from
childhood
but
of
whose
loss
she
had
hitherto
never
complained
henrich
illness
proved
a
very
long
and
painful
one
and
notwithstanding
the
kindness
of
all
her
friends
and
the
attentions
paid
by
the
rest
of
the
settlers
to
the
young
patient
who
was
a
general
favorite
it
was
difficult
to
procure
for
him
either
the
food
or
the
medical
attendance
that
his
case
required
and
frequently
his
parents
feared
that
a
foreign
grave
would
soon
be
all
that
would
remain
to
them
of
their
child
to
add
to
their
anxiety
and
distress
an
epidemic
disease
of
which
some
signs
had
appeared
in
the
settlement
before
the
exploring
party
set
out
now
increased
to
a
fearful
degree
the
stores
which
had
been
brought
out
in
the
crowded
mayflower
were
nearly
expended
except
such
a
stock
as
captain
jones
considered
necessary
for
the
voyage
back
to
england
and
a
great
scarcity
of
bread
began
to
be
felt
the
animals
which
they
procured
by
the
gun
and
the
chase
were
not
sufficient
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
settlers
and
famine
actual
famine
stared
them
in
the
face
and
increased
the
violence
of
the
pestilence
many
sank
beneath
the
accumulated
evils
of
hardship
privation
and
sickness
and
the
number
of
the
little
settlement
was
sadly
reduced
during
the
inclement
months
of
january
and
february
the
constant
care
which
was
bestowed
on
henrich
at
length
proved
effectual
in
healing
his
wound
and
partially
restoring
his
strength
and
his
parents
had
eventually
the
happiness
of
seeing
that
the
a
anger
was
past
and
their
son
was
restored
to
them
they
also
had
cause
to
acknowledge
with
gratitude
that
the
affliction
had
been
blessed
to
him
as
well
as
to
themselves
the
elders
of
the
community
who
acted
as
the
pastors
of
the
infant
colony
were
unwearied
in
their
attentions
to
their
weaker
and
more
distressed
brethren
they
were
indeed
the
physicians
both
of
their
bodies
and
souls
and
henrich
was
not
neglected
by
them
the
excellent
and
venerable
william
brewster
was
the
intimate
and
valued
friend
of
rodolph
maitland
and
his
wife
he
had
been
both
their
friend
and
adviser
for
many
years
of
comparative
peace
and
prosperity
and
now
that
he
shared
their
troubles
and
adversities
his
ready
sympathy
and
active
kindness
rendered
him
dearer
to
them
than
ever
brewster
was
a
man
whose
character
and
position
in
life
naturally
gave
him
great
influence
with
the
pilgrim
fathers
he
had
received
a
liberal
education
and
possessed
a
far
greater
knowledge
of
the
world
than
the
generality
of
his
companions
in
exile
having
been
brought
up
as
a
diplomatist
under
davison
when
he
was
secretary
of
state
to
queen
elisabeth
he
was
devoted
to
the
cause
of
religious
liberty
and
it
was
he
who
had
assisted
his
friend
john
robinson
in
withdrawing
his
congregation
from
the
persecution
that
threatened
them
in
england
to
a
peaceful
asylum
in
holland
at
the
time
of
the
emigration
to
america
he
was
already
in
the
decline
of
life
but
his
energies
were
in
no
degree
weakened
and
his
zeal
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
his
fellow
christians
was
unabated
he
desired
to
spend
all
his
remaining
years
in
promoting
the
welfare
of
the
colony
and
in
proclaiming
the
gospel
to
the
heathen
and
while
he
was
ever
mindful
of
the
wants
both
spiritual
and
temporal
of
the
flock
ever
whom
he
was
appointed
to
preside
until
their
pastor
robinson
could
join
them
he
never
forgot
the
grand
object
of
his
voluntary
exile
or
ceased
to
pray
that
the
lord
would
be
pleased
to
open
great
door
and
effectual
before
him
and
enable
him
to
bring
many
of
the
savage
and
ignorant
natives
into
the
fold
of
christ
in
all
these
plans
he
was
warmly
seconded
by
edward
winslow
but
hitherto
no
such
opening
had
appeared
and
the
sickness
and
distress
which
prevailed
in
the
settlement
gave
full
occupation
to
them
and
to
their
brother
elders
during
all
the
period
of
henrich
tedious
illness
not
a
day
passed
in
which
brewster
did
not
visit
the
suffering
boy
to
cheer
him
to
soothe
him
and
above
all
to
prepare
him
for
that
better
world
to
which
he
then
believed
he
was
surely
hastening
to
these
visits
henrich
looked
forward
with
delight
and
often
when
domestic
business
called
away
his
mother
and
janet
the
minister
would
remain
with
him
for
hours
seated
on
a
low
stool
by
of
his
bed
and
read
to
him
or
talk
to
him
in
a
strain
so
holy
and
yet
so
cheerful
that
edith
would
leave
her
work
and
softly
seat
herself
on
couch
that
she
might
catch
his
every
word
while
little
ludovico
would
cease
from
his
noisy
sports
and
creep
up
on
the
good
man
knee
and
fix
his
large
soft
eyes
on
his
sweet
and
noble
countenance
these
hours
were
not
unimproved
by
henrich
his
character
was
formed
and
his
principles
were
fixed
and
his
mind
and
spirit
grew
strong
and
ripe
beyond
his
years
never
were
these
hours
of
peaceful
happiness
forgotten
and
often
amid
the
strange
and
stirring
scenes
which
it
was
his
lot
in
to
witness
and
to
share
did
he
bless
the
ruling
providence
of
god
which
had
laid
him
on
a
bed
of
pain
and
weakness
that
he
might
learn
lessons
of
piety
and
of
usefulness
which
otherwise
he
would
never
have
acquired
it
was
while
they
were
thus
happily
engaged
one
afternoon
when
henrich
was
slowly
recovering
his
strength
that
the
elder
and
his
young
audience
were
startled
by
wild
and
discordant
sounds
mingled
with
cries
of
fear
which
proceeded
from
the
outskirts
of
the
straggling
village
and
seemed
to
be
approaching
henrich
raised
himself
on
his
bed
and
a
look
of
terror
overspread
his
countenance
as
he
exclaimed
is
the
war
cry
of
the
savages
o
i
know
it
well
go
brewster
fly
save
my
mother
i
will
follow
you
and
the
brave
boy
tried
to
leap
from
the
couch
and
reach
his
sword
which
hung
against
the
wooden
walls
of
his
chamber
but
it
was
in
vain
the
wounded
leg
refused
to
bear
his
weight
and
he
was
forced
to
relinquish
his
design
brewster
however
snatched
the
sword
and
drawing
it
rushed
from
the
hut
leaving
edith
and
ludovico
clinging
with
trembling
hands
around
their
brother
henrich
fears
proved
but
too
true
no
sooner
had
the
elder
traversed
the
enclosure
that
surrounded
maitland
dwelling
than
he
beheld
helen
and
several
of
the
other
women
who
had
gone
out
to
assist
their
husbands
in
the
lighter
parts
of
their
agricultural
labors
flying
in
terror
and
confusion
to
their
huts
while
the
men
were
engaged
in
close
combat
with
a
party
of
native
indians
the
same
which
had
rung
on
their
ears
in
the
first
encounter
told
rodolph
and
his
comrades
that
these
savages
were
of
the
same
tribe
and
probably
the
same
individuals
from
whom
they
had
escaped
with
such
difficulty
on
that
occasion
they
were
right
for
it
was
indeed
a
band
of
the
nausetts
who
headed
by
their
chief
had
come
to
seek
revenge
for
the
loss
they
had
sustained
at
their
former
meeting
the
warrior
whom
rodolph
musket
had
laid
low
was
tekoa
the
only
son
of
the
nausett
chief
and
he
was
resolved
that
the
white
man
blood
should
flow
to
expiate
the
deed
he
knew
that
the
son
of
the
stranger
who
had
slain
his
young
warrior
had
been
wounded
and
as
he
hoped
mortally
but
that
did
not
suffice
for
his
revenge
and
he
had
either
suddenly
attacked
the
settlement
in
the
hope
of
securing
either
rudolph
himself
or
some
of
his
comrades
that
he
might
shed
the
white
man
blood
on
the
grave
of
his
son
and
tear
off
their
scalps
as
trophies
of
victory
the
settlers
who
now
contended
with
the
savages
were
but
few
in
number
for
many
of
the
men
lay
sick
and
many
had
died
and
they
were
mostly
unarmed
except
with
their
agricultural
implements
rudolph
and
a
few
others
had
short
swords
or
dirks
attached
to
their
girdles
and
with
these
they
dealt
blows
that
told
with
deadly
effect
on
the
bodies
of
their
foes
and
the
good
that
brewster
quickly
placed
in
maitland
hand
was
not
long
in
discomfiting
several
of
the
indians
who
had
singled
him
out
at
the
command
of
their
chief
as
the
special
object
of
their
attack
meanwhile
many
of
the
women
and
such
of
the
invalids
as
had
power
to
rise
had
again
left
the
huts
and
borne
to
their
husbands
and
friends
the
arms
which
had
been
left
in
their
dwellings
and
in
spite
of
the
arrows
and
darts
of
the
indians
by
which
several
of
them
were
wounded
they
continued
to
load
the
guns
for
the
combatants
while
the
conflict
lasted
happily
this
was
not
long
the
muskets
struck
terror
into
the
ignorant
savages
and
when
two
or
three
of
their
number
had
fallen
they
turned
to
fly
first
however
catching
up
the
bodies
of
their
comrades
which
they
carried
off
to
ensure
their
honorable
burial
and
to
save
them
from
the
indignities
which
they
supposed
the
would
heap
on
the
dead
in
vain
their
chief
endeavored
to
rally
them
and
compel
them
to
return
to
the
conflict
in
vain
he
waved
his
on
high
and
shouted
his
woach
woach
ha
ha
hach
woach
a
panic
had
seized
his
followers
and
they
fled
precipitately
into
the
forest
from
they
had
issued
so
suddenly
and
so
fiercely
to
the
attack
one
warrior
stood
alone
by
the
chief
he
was
young
and
handsome
but
his
countenance
was
dark
and
sinister
and
an
expression
of
cunning
was
strongly
marked
in
his
glittering
eyes
and
overhanging
brows
he
saw
that
it
was
hopeless
to
contend
any
longer
with
the
powerful
strangers
and
by
words
and
actions
he
was
evidently
persuading
the
chief
to
retire
the
settlers
had
ceased
to
fire
the
moment
that
their
enemies
fled
and
there
was
a
deep
silence
while
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
striking
figure
of
the
enraged
chief
whose
every
feature
was
distorted
by
excited
passions
he
stood
with
his
tomahawk
uplifted
and
his
tall
and
muscular
figure
in
an
attitude
of
command
and
defiance
while
in
a
loud
and
distinct
voice
he
uttered
a
vow
of
vengeance
the
words
of
which
were
unintelligible
to
the
settlers
though
the
meaning
could
easily
be
guessed
from
his
looks
and
gestures
then
he
hung
his
to
his
gaudy
belt
and
pointing
his
hand
at
rodolph
he
retired
slowly
and
majestically
like
a
lion
discomfited
but
not
subdued
to
seek
his
people
and
to
upbraid
them
with
their
cowardice
this
attack
of
the
indians
effectually
destroyed
all
feelings
of
security
in
the
minds
of
the
settlers
henceforth
they
were
obliged
like
the
jews
of
old
to
go
to
their
labor
every
man
with
his
sword
girded
to
his
side
and
continually
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
for
a
sudden
assault
the
pestilence
continued
to
rage
and
the
scarcity
of
food
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
for
several
weeks
no
bread
was
to
be
been
in
the
settlement
the
governor
mr
carver
exerted
himself
with
zeal
and
benevolence
to
lesser
the
misery
of
his
people
but
with
so
little
effect
that
when
the
spring
at
length
set
in
and
the
captain
of
the
mayflower
prepared
to
return
to
england
the
little
band
of
settlers
was
found
to
be
reduced
to
one
half
the
original
number
and
these
were
weakened
by
illness
and
by
want
of
proper
nourishment
but
great
as
were
their
difficulties
and
sufferings
their
faith
and
resolution
never
failed
and
when
the
mayflower
again
set
sail
for
england
not
one
of
the
fifty
emigrants
who
remained
expressed
a
desire
to
return

of

their
tinged

so
smooth
as
never
yet
anxiety
nor

had
made
a
furrow
soon
the
courteous
guise
of
men
not
purporting
nor

won
confidence
their
wild
distrustful
looks
assumed
a
milder

madoc
we
have
said
that
the
band
of
the
exiles
was
reduced
to
half
the
number
that
had
six
months
before
left
the
shores
of
europe
so
full
of
hope
and
of
holy
resolution
and
still
in
spite
of
all
their
outward
trials
and
difficulties
the
hope
and
the
resolution
of
the
survivors
were
as
high
and
as
firm
as
ever
they
trusted
in
the
god
whom
they
had
served
so
faithfully
and
they
knew
that
in
his
own
good
time
he
would
give
them
deliverance
but
their
days
of
darkness
were
not
yet
over
the
inclemency
of
the
winter
had
indeed
passed
away
and
the
face
of
nature
began
to
smile
upon
them
yet
sickness
still
prevailed
and
the
many
graves
that
rose
on
the
spot
which
they
had
chosen
for
a
burial
ground
daily
reminded
them
of
the
losses
that
almost
every
family
had
already
sustained
the
grief
that
had
thus
been
brought
upon
them
by
death
was
also
greatly
aggravated
by
the
harassing
attacks
of
the
indians
who
were
evidently
still
lurking
in
the
neighboring
woods
and
who
now
frequently
came
in
small
parties
and
committed
depredations
of
every
kind
that
lay
in
their
power
their
real
but
concealed
object
was
to
capture
rodolph
either
alive
or
dead
for
nothing
short
of
his
destruction
or
at
least
that
of
some
member
of
his
family
could
satisfy
the
bereaved
chief
for
the
loss
of
his
son
he
therefore
left
a
party
of
his
bravest
and
most
subtle
warriors
in
an
encampment
about
a
day
journey
from
the
christian
village
with
orders
to
make
frequent
visits
to
the
settlement
and
leave
no
means
untried
which
either
force
or
cunning
could
suggest
that
might
lead
to
the
full
gratification
of
his
revenge
the
old
chief
himself
returned
to
his
wigwams
which
lay
some
distance
from
new
plymouth
near
the
burial
ground
where
the
encounter
taken
place
the
detachment
was
left
under
the
command
end
guidance
of
coubitant
the
young
warrior
who
had
stood
by
him
to
the
last
in
the
conflict
at
the
village
and
who
was
since
the
death
of
tisquantum
son
regarded
as
the
most
distinguished
of
the
young
braves
of
that
part
of
the
tribe
over
which
the
sachem
ruled
his
cunning
and
his
ferocious
courage
well
fitted
him
for
the
task
assigned
to
him
and
as
the
young
warrior
who
fell
at
first
encounter
had
been
his
chosen
friend
and
companion
in
arms
his
own
desire
for
vengeance
was
only
second
to
that
of
the
chief
and
the
malignant
gaze
which
he
had
fixed
on
rodolph
when
he
led
tisquantum
from
the
field
well
expressed
the
feelings
and
the
determination
of
his
heart
that
glance
had
been
seen
by
janet
who
on
that
occasion
had
displayed
a
courage
and
resolution
hardly
to
be
expected
at
her
advanced
age
she
had
easily
induced
her
trembling
mistress
to
remain
in
the
house
whither
they
had
both
fled
at
the
first
attack
of
the
indians
but
she
had
herself
returned
to
the
place
of
conflict
bearing
rodolph
musket
and
ammunition
and
she
bad
remained
by
the
side
of
brewster
to
whose
ready
hand
she
transferred
it
until
all
danger
was
over
then
she
had
fixed
her
attention
on
the
chief
and
his
companion
and
the
fine
form
and
handsome
features
of
the
young
indian
warrior
appeared
like
a
statue
of
bronze
while
he
stood
motionless
by
tisquantum
but
when
he
turned
to
follow
his
chief
the
expression
with
which
he
looked
at
rodolph
transformed
his
countenance
into
that
of
a
demoniac
janet
never
forgot
that
look
the
state
of
continual
watchfulness
and
suspense
in
which
the
emigrants
were
kept
by
their
wary
and
active
foes
was
extremely
harassing
to
their
weakened
force
so
much
so
that
the
president
resolved
to
make
another
attempt
to
establish
a
friendly
intercourse
with
some
other
native
tribe
who
might
possibly
assist
them
in
driving
of
the
nausetts
and
whose
friendship
would
also
be
useful
to
them
in
various
ways
an
opportunity
for
this
attempt
soon
presented
itself
for
a
party
of
the
settlers
in
following
the
windings
of
a
brook
that
flowed
through
their
new
town
into
the
sea
in
pursuit
of
wild
fowl
came
upon
two
large
and
beautiful
lakes
about
three
miles
inland
the
shores
of
these
lakes
were
adorned
with
clumps
of
lofty
and
majestic
trees
and
the
grass
was
spangled
with
wild
flowers
and
studded
with
graceful
shrubs
and
underwood
among
the
bushes
they
descried
several
fallow
deer
and
the
surface
of
the
water
was
animated
by
flocks
of
water
fowl
among
which
the
brilliant
and
graceful
wood
duck
was
conspicuous
but
the
objects
that
chiefly
attracted
the
notice
of
the
sportsmen
were
several
wigwams
that
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
lake
beneath
the
shade
of
some
overhanging
trees
in
front
of
these
huts
the
children
were
playing
while
the
women
were
pursuing
their
domestic
occupations
some
were
weaving
baskets
and
mats
and
others
washing
their
fishing
nets
in
the
lake
but
no
men
were
to
be
seen
and
rodolph
who
as
usual
led
the
hunting
party
determined
to
approach
the
wigwams
in
order
to
show
his
peaceful
intentions
be
gave
his
musket
to
one
of
his
companions
and
inviting
his
friend
winslow
to
do
the
same
and
to
accompany
him
he
proceeded
round
the
lake
as
soon
as
the
women
perceived
them
they
uttered
wild
cries
of
fear
and
snatching
up
their
children
attempted
to
escape
into
the
thicket
behind
their
huts
rodolph
and
winslow
then
started
in
pursuit
and
succeeded
in
capturing
one
little
fellow
who
was
endeavoring
to
keep
pace
with
his
mother
she
could
not
carry
him
for
she
had
already
an
infant
in
her
arms
and
she
knew
not
that
he
was
in
the
power
of
their
dreaded
pursuers
until
she
reached
the
thicket
and
looked
back
for
her
boy
he
was
struggling
violently
in
hands
but
not
a
cry
escaped
his
lips
and
when
he
found
all
his
efforts
to
free
himself
were
vain
he
gave
up
the
attempt
and
stood
motionless
with
a
look
of
proud
endurance
that
was
highly
characteristic
of
his
race
his
mother
had
less
fortitude
she
uttered
a
shriek
that
pierced
the
heart
of
rodolph
and
laying
her
infant
on
the
grass
she
almost
forgot
her
own
fears
and
in
an
imploring
attitude
crept
forward
towards
her
imaginary
foes
while
her
eloquent
eyes
pleaded
for
her
child
release
more
than
any
words
could
have
done
maitland
could
not
resist
that
appeal
he
only
detained
the
boy
until
he
had
hung
round
his
neck
several
strings
of
beads
with
which
the
hunters
were
always
provided
and
then
he
set
him
at
liberty
in
an
instant
the
child
was
in
his
mother
arms
and
when
her
passionate
caresses
had
expressed
her
joy
she
waved
with
a
graceful
salutation
to
the
englishman
and
bent
to
the
ground
in
token
of
gratitude
then
she
looked
at
the
beads
and
her
white
teeth
glittered
as
she
smiled
a
sunny
smile
of
delight
and
admiration
at
what
seemed
to
her
such
priceless
treasures
rodolph
drew
from
the
pouch
which
hung
at
his
leathern
belt
a
string
of
beads
more
brilliant
still
and
held
them
towards
the
woman
she
gazed
at
them
and
then
at
the
frank
and
open
countenance
of
the
stranger
and
fear
gave
way
to
the
desire
of
possessing
the
offered
gift
she
slowly
approached
holding
her
child
by
the
hand
and
suffered
rodolph
to
suspend
the
gaudy
necklace
round
her
graceful
and
slender
throat
then
she
motioned
to
him
to
remain
and
ran
swiftly
to
the
thicket
to
bring
back
her
companions
who
had
paused
in
their
flight
and
were
now
watching
with
eager
eyes
the
actions
of
the
white
man
her
persuasions
and
the
sight
of
her
ornament
soon
overcame
the
remaining
fears
of
her
auditors
and
all
returned
in
a
body
smiling
and
extending
their
hands
in
the
hope
of
receiving
similar
gifts
maitland
and
winslow
who
had
now
joined
him
divided
all
their
store
of
trinkets
among
the
eager
applicants
and
then
in
return
made
signs
requesting
to
be
permitted
to
enter
the
wigwams
this
request
was
acceded
to
and
apannow
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
female
who
had
first
approached
the
strangers
led
the
way
to
the
hut
in
the
center
of
the
village
which
was
larger
and
better
appointed
than
any
one
of
the
rest
it
was
evidently
the
dwelling
of
the
chief
of
the
tribe
and
the
beautifully
carved
implements
which
hung
to
the
walls
and
the
skulls
and
scalps
that
adorned
the
roof
showed
that
its
possessor
was
a
distinguished
warrior
apannow
brought
forth
the
best
refreshment
that
her
hut
afforded
and
placed
it
with
a
native
grace
before
her
guests
inviting
them
to
partake
of
it
and
first
tasting
of
each
article
herself
to
show
that
it
was
harmless
her
gentle
and
intelligent
manners
greatly
interested
rudolph
and
his
companion
and
by
degrees
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
her
and
the
other
women
who
crowded
the
wigwam
such
information
as
they
chiefly
desired
by
expressive
signs
and
gestures
they
were
made
to
understand
that
all
the
red
men
were
gone
on
a
fishing
expedition
to
the
head
of
the
further
lake
and
would
not
return
until
the
morrow
they
afterwards
learnt
also
that
the
village
had
only
been
occupied
for
a
few
days
as
it
was
merely
the
summer
residence
of
a
part
of
the
tribe
of
the
wampanoge
indians
who
with
their
chief
annually
repaired
to
that
beautiful
station
for
the
purpose
of
fishing
in
the
extensive
lakes
the
rest
of
the
tribe
were
located
in
various
places
to
the
west
occupying
the
district
since
known
as
the
state
of
rhode
island
maitland
and
winslow
took
leave
of
their
new
friends
intimating
that
they
would
return
and
seek
an
interview
with
the
chief
in
two
days
and
bearing
with
them
a
supply
of
fish
and
dried
maize
which
they
received
from
apannow
as
a
pledge
of
amity
and
which
they
knew
would
be
most
welcome
to
the
invalids
who
were
still
suffering
from
disease
at
the
settlement
they
quickly
rejoined
the
rest
of
their
comrades
who
had
remained
at
a
distance
for
fear
of
alarming
the
timid
indian
females
and
all
returned
to
new
plymouth
the
intelligence
they
brought
and
the
seasonable
refreshment
they
bore
to
the
sick
were
joyfully
welcomed
by
the
whole
community
and
the
spirits
of
the
settlers
rose
at
the
prospect
of
securing
indian
friends
and
allies
who
might
under
their
present
distressing
circumstances
afford
them
such
essential
help
and
security
the
necessity
for
such
aid
had
lately
become
more
urgent
than
ever
for
a
party
of
their
untiring
enemies
the
nausetts
had
very
recently
invaded
the
enclosure
within
which
lay
the
loved
remains
of
all
who
bad
perished
since
their
arrival
in
america
the
graves
were
sadly
numerous
and
the
sorrowing
survivors
had
reverently
decked
the
mounds
that
covered
them
with
shrubs
and
green
boughs
from
the
evergreens
that
abounded
in
the
neighboring
woods
as
emblems
of
their
abiding
grief
and
also
of
their
immortal
hopes
these
marks
of
affectionate
regard
the
savages
had
rudely
torn
away
and
not
content
with
this
they
had
even
in
some
instances
removed
the
turf
and
dug
up
the
earth
so
as
to
expose
the
coffins
that
lay
beneath
no
other
injury
or
outrage
could
have
so
deeply
wounded
the
feelings
or
aroused
the
indignation
of
the
emigrants
as
this
desecration
of
the
homes
of
the
dead
and
they
earnestly
desired
to
form
some
alliance
with
another
tribe
which
might
enable
them
to
punish
and
to
prevent
such
gross
and
wanton
indignities
in
the
meantime
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
a
recurrence
of
so
distressing
a
calamity
the
colonists
ploughed
over
the
whole
surface
of
their
cemetery
and
sowed
it
with
corn
thus
concealing
what
was
to
them
so
sacred
from
the
eyes
of
their
wild
and
ruthless
foes
the
day
after
maitland
visit
to
the
wigwams
the
emigrants
were
astonished
at
the
appearance
of
a
fine
athletic
indian
armed
with
a
bow
and
arrows
who
walked
up
to
the
common
hall
near
the
center
of
the
village
and
saluted
the
governor
and
those
who
were
with
him
in
the
words
englishmen
in
reply
to
their
eager
inquiries
he
informed
them
that
his
name
was
samoset
and
that
he
was
sagamore
of
a
northern
tribe
of
indians
dwelling
near
the
coast
of
maine
where
he
had
acquired
a
slight
knowledge
of
the
english
language
from
the
fishermen
who
frequented
the
island
of
monhiggon
near
that
shore
he
had
been
for
several
months
residing
among
the
wampanoges
and
on
the
return
of
the
chief
and
his
followers
to
the
wigwams
he
had
heard
from
the
that
two
strangers
who
from
her
account
he
concluded
to
be
englishmen
had
visited
the
encampment
and
proposed
to
do
so
again
in
two
days
he
had
therefore
by
desire
of
the
chief
mooanam
come
over
to
the
british
settlement
to
assure
the
emigrants
of
a
friendly
reception
and
to
conduct
the
embassy
to
the
presence
of
the
sagamore
his
kind
offices
were
gratefully
and
joyfully
accepted
by
the
governor
and
samoset
remained
that
day
as
his
guest
although
the
indian
knowledge
of
english
was
very
limited
the
pilgrim
fathers
learnt
from
him
the
name
and
something
of
the
history
of
their
inveterate
foes
the
nausetts
and
also
that
the
commencement
of
their
enmity
to
the
settlers
arose
not
merely
from
their
being
intruders
on
their
domains
but
from
the
remembrance
of
an
injury
which
they
had
received
some
years
previously
from
an
english
captain
of
the
name
of
hunt
who
when
cruising
on
these
shores
had
allured
a
number
of
natives
on
board
his
ship
and
had
then
treacherously
carried
them
off
and
sold
the
greater
part
of
them
at
malaga
as
slaves
two
he
took
with
him
to
england
and
they
at
length
got
back
to
cape
cod
bay
in
a
vessel
belonging
to
the
plymouth
company
this
scandalous
action
had
filled
the
nausetts
and
pokanokits
who
were
the
injured
tribes
with
bitter
hatred
against
the
white
men
and
five
years
afterwards
they
would
have
sacrificed
the
life
of
captain
dermer
when
he
was
skirting
these
shores
had
he
not
been
saved
by
squanto
one
of
the
kidnapped
pokanokits
whom
he
had
brought
back
in
his
vessel
and
who
had
become
attached
to
the
english
footnote
the
pokanokit
dwelt
on
the
peninsula
which
forms
the
bay
of
cape
cod
and
on
a
small
pert
or
rhode
island
the
rest
being
occupied
by
the
wampanoge
of
whom
masasoyt
was
grand
sagamore
the
feeling
of
animosity
thus
engendered
had
been
aggravated
by
the
slaughter
of
tisquantum
only
son
and
little
hope
could
be
entertained
of
establishing
a
friendly
intercourse
with
a
tribe
who
felt
that
they
had
so
much
to
revenge
against
the
white
race
in
two
days
according
to
the
intimation
of
rodolph
to
the
indian
women
a
deputation
of
the
settlers
headed
by
captain
standish
and
accompanied
by
maitland
repaired
to
the
indian
village
under
the
guidance
of
samoset
they
were
expected
by
the
inhabitants
and
as
soon
as
they
were
perceived
approaching
round
the
margin
of
the
lake
two
young
men
came
forth
to
meet
them
and
accompany
them
to
the
tent
of
the
chief
mooanam
was
prepared
for
their
reception
and
attired
in
his
gala
costume
of
furs
and
feathers
with
his
most
elaborately
worked
hung
to
his
side
and
a
long
and
slender
spear
tipped
with
bone
in
his
hand
he
rose
from
his
seat
on
the
ground
at
the
entrance
of
the
strangers
and
greeted
them
courteously
while
his
wife
the
apannow
and
his
lively
little
son
nepea
stood
by
his
side
and
smiled
a
welcome
to
rodolph
pointing
at
the
same
time
significantly
to
the
beads
which
adorned
their
necks
and
arms
standish
had
now
an
interpreter
though
a
very
imperfect
one
and
by
his
means
a
sort
of
friendly
compact
was
formed
and
gifts
were
exchanged
as
the
pledges
of
its
sincerity
an
invitation
was
then
given
to
the
young
chief
and
to
his
brother
quadequina
who
was
one
of
those
who
had
conducted
the
white
men
to
their
presence
to
return
the
visit
of
the
settlers
by
coming
the
following
day
to
their
town
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
the
deputation
returned
to
their
homes
escorted
a
great
part
of
the
by
many
of
their
indian
allies
great
preparations
were
made
at
new
plymouth
for
the
reception
of
the
red
chief
and
his
attendants
in
such
a
manner
as
to
impress
them
with
the
wealth
and
power
of
emigrants
the
large
wooden
building
which
was
intended
as
a
sort
of
council
chamber
and
public
hall
was
hung
inside
with
cloth
and
linen
of
various
colors
and
ornamented
with
swords
and
muskets
and
pistols
that
the
colony
could
produce
an
elevated
seat
was
placed
for
the
governor
at
the
upper
end
of
the
apartment
and
tables
composed
of
long
planks
were
laid
down
on
each
side
on
which
were
arranged
such
viands
as
the
settlers
could
produce
the
repast
was
humble
but
helen
and
her
female
friends
arranged
it
with
taste
and
the
children
gathered
the
bright
wild
flowers
that
so
early
enliven
the
groves
and
meadows
when
an
american
winter
has
passed
away
to
deck
the
tables
and
form
garlands
along
the
walls
a
strange
contrast
did
these
buds
and
blossoms
of
spring
form
to
the
implements
of
war
and
death
with
which
they
were
mingled
but
the
effect
of
the
whole
was
gay
and
appeared
very
imposing
to
the
simple
children
of
the
wilderness
as
they
entered
the
wide
portal
and
passed
up
the
hall
to
meet
the
puritan
governor
john
carver
and
his
attendants
were
clad
in
the
and
sober
garments
which
were
usually
adopted
by
their
sect
and
their
long
beards
and
grave
countenances
struck
a
feeling
of
awe
and
reverence
into
their
savage
guests
but
the
red
men
betrayed
no
embarrassment
or
timidity
they
advanced
with
a
step
at
once
bold
and
graceful
and
even
controlled
their
natural
feeling
of
curiosity
so
far
as
to
cast
no
wandering
glances
at
the
novelties
that
surrounded
them
they
kept
their
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
governor
and
returned
his
salutation
with
a
courteous
dignity
that
did
credit
to
their
native
breeding
and
then
the
chief
and
quadequina
seated
themselves
on
the
chairs
that
were
placed
for
them
on
each
side
of
the
seat
of
the
president
such
a
mode
of
sitting
was
certainly
altogether
new
to
these
sons
of
the
forest
and
they
found
it
both
awkward
and
disagreeable
yet
they
showed
no
discomposure
or
restraint
and
not
a
smile
betrayed
their
surprise
either
at
this
or
any
other
of
the
strange
customs
of
their
hosts
after
a
few
rather
amusing
efforts
to
carry
on
a
communication
with
his
guests
through
the
intervention
of
samoset
carver
invited
them
to
table
and
again
had
occasion
to
admire
the
readiness
and
the
natural
grace
with
which
they
accommodated
themselves
to
customs
so
new
and
so
wonderful
as
those
of
the
white
men
when
the
repast
was
concluded
the
president
led
mooanam
and
his
party
round
the
village
and
showed
them
everything
that
was
worthy
of
attention
and
so
intelligent
did
he
find
them
that
he
had
no
difficulty
in
making
them
comprehend
the
use
of
many
european
implements
and
many
of
the
inventions
and
contrivances
of
civilized
life
with
much
satisfaction
the
good
pastor
brewster
marked
the
sparkling
eyes
and
speaking
countenances
of
these
gentle
savages
for
he
there
hoped
he
saw
encouragement
to
his
ardent
hope
of
ere
long
bringing
them
to
a
knowledge
of
the
simple
and
saving
truths
of
the
gospel
with
the
governor
permission
he
led
them
to
the
plain
and
unadorned
edifice
which
was
the
emigrants
place
of
worship
and
easily
made
them
understand
that
it
was
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
one
great
spirit
who
reigns
over
all
and
from
thence
they
were
conducted
to
the
cemetery
and
shown
by
expressive
signs
the
insult
that
had
been
offered
to
the
dead
by
men
of
their
own
race
some
like
implements
that
had
been
picked
up
after
one
of
the
recent
skirmishes
were
shown
to
mooanam
and
his
brother
when
they
instantly
exclaimed
and
knitting
their
brows
and
putting
themselves
into
an
attitude
of
defiance
they
plainly
intimated
that
the
tribe
was
one
with
which
they
were
at
enmity
they
pointed
in
the
direction
where
the
nausetts
dwelt
and
seemed
to
invite
the
settlers
to
join
them
in
assaulting
their
encampment
but
ignorance
of
their
language
and
of
their
habits
prevented
the
president
from
assenting
to
what
appeared
to
be
their
earnest
wish
as
the
sickness
that
had
so
long
raged
in
the
colony
had
now
nearly
disappeared
and
the
advance
of
the
season
promised
soon
to
open
sources
of
plentiful
provision
in
the
and
the
fields
and
streams
brewster
felt
that
he
could
be
spared
for
a
time
from
the
settlement
and
he
proposed
to
mr
carver
that
he
should
return
with
mooanam
to
his
village
and
endeavor
to
acquire
such
a
knowledge
of
the
native
language
as
should
enable
hint
to
act
as
an
interpreter
and
also
give
him
the
means
of
imparting
to
the
red
men
the
spiritual
knowledge
that
he
so
ardently
desired
to
bestow
the
governor
willingly
consented
to
this
proposal
and
when
it
was
explained
to
the
indian
chief
he
gave
the
most
cordial
and
ready
assent
the
mild
yet
dignified
countenance
of
the
elder
had
won
his
respect
and
confidence
and
he
hoped
to
gain
as
great
advantages
from
a
more
intimate
connection
with
the
white
men
as
they
expected
from
his
alliance
and
support
henrich
was
now
able
to
leave
his
couch
and
again
to
join
edith
and
his
young
companions
out
of
doors
but
he
still
looked
delicate
and
his
former
strength
and
activity
had
not
fully
returned
he
was
however
able
to
walk
with
the
assistance
of
a
crutch
that
his
father
had
made
for
him
and
he
formed
one
of
the
group
that
followed
the
indians
in
their
procession
through
the
village
and
also
escorted
them
as
far
as
the
confines
of
the
wood
in
whose
depths
their
village
lay
the
chief
remarked
the
boy
and
showed
sympathy
for
his
lameness
which
he
was
given
to
understand
was
owing
to
an
aggression
of
the
nausetts
and
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
nostrils
dilated
and
his
whole
countenance
was
changed
from
its
habitual
expression
of
gentle
dignity
to
one
of
fierce
hostility
it
was
evident
that
in
these
wampanoges
the
settlers
had
secured
allies
who
would
be
zealous
and
persevering
in
protecting
them
from
the
attacks
of
their
harassing
enemies
the
nausetts
and
who
would
when
the
proper
time
should
arrive
assist
them
in
fleeing
the
district
of
such
troublesome
inhabitants
the
indians
returned
to
their
wigwams
and
the
elder
accompanied
them
and
became
an
inmate
of
mooanam
lodge
he
soon
began
to
acquire
some
knowledge
of
the
language
of
his
host
and
also
to
instruct
him
and
his
wife
in
many
english
words
and
phrases
in
which
their
aptitude
to
learn
astonished
him
a
constant
communication
was
kept
up
between
the
indian
village
and
that
of
the
settlers
and
a
real
regard
and
esteem
sprang
up
between
them
as
the
spring
advanced
henrich
was
able
to
throw
aside
his
crutch
and
to
accompany
his
father
and
mother
in
their
frequent
visits
to
the
wigwams
and
much
of
his
leisure
time
was
passed
in
the
company
of
the
young
indians
of
his
own
age
whose
activity
and
address
in
all
their
sports
and
games
he
admired
and
emulated
the
presence
of
his
friend
brewster
in
the
wampanoge
village
also
gave
it
increased
attractions
in
the
eyes
of
henrich
the
good
man
was
still
his
friend
and
preceptor
and
with
his
assistance
he
made
considerable
progress
in
the
acquirement
of
the
native
language
as
well
as
in
every
other
kind
of
knowledge
that
brewster
was
able
to
impart
but
all
the
elder
instructions
were
made
subservient
to
that
best
of
all
knowledge
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
his
revealed
word
and
in
this
his
pupil
advanced
and
grew
in
a
manner
that
both
surprised
and
delighted
him
the
boy
naturally
thoughtful
character
had
become
matured
during
his
long
and
painful
illness
and
he
had
learnt
to
feel
the
value
of
heavenly
things
and
the
comparative
littleness
of
all
things
which
are
seen
and
are
temporal
he
entered
warmly
into
all
the
elder
benevolent
desires
and
intentions
for
the
conversion
of
the
dark
heathen
among
whom
their
lot
was
cast
and
he
already
looked
forward
to
being
his
assistant
in
the
holy
work
brewster
regarded
him
as
destined
to
become
both
a
pastor
and
a
zealous
and
successful
missionary
when
he
should
arrive
at
a
proper
age
and
he
frequently
spoke
of
him
as
his
own
appointed
successor
in
the
spiritual
direction
of
the
congregation
this
sacred
office
henrich
anticipated
with
pride
and
satisfaction
for
where
could
he
find
a
more
fitting
exercise
for
his
adventurous
and
enterprising
spirit
and
also
for
his
love
of
the
truth
than
in
seeking
the
wild
men
amid
their
forests
and
wildernesses
and
winning
them
to
peace
and
happiness
and
civilization
by
the
knowledge
of
the
doctrines
of
the
gospel
with
the
indians
he
soon
became
a
great
favorite
and
the
readiness
with
which
he
acquired
the
use
of
the
bow
and
learnt
to
cast
the
dart
and
wield
the
light
tomahawks
that
were
used
by
the
indian
boys
to
practice
their
young
hands
excited
their
warmest
admiration
and
made
them
prophesy
that
he
would
one
day
become
a
distinguished
brave
his
skill
in
hunting
and
fishing
also
became
considerable
and
he
learnt
from
his
friends
many
of
their
songs
and
dances
with
which
he
delighted
edith
and
ludovico
at
home
his
new
companions
did
not
draw
away
his
affections
from
his
sister
she
was
still
the
object
of
his
warmest
love
and
to
give
her
pleasure
was
the
strongest
desire
of
his
heart
in
his
long
rambles
with
his
indian
he
never
forgot
his
edith
and
many
a
stream
was
crossed
and
many
a
rock
was
climbed
to
procure
flowering
plants
to
deck
her
garden
and
creepers
to
clothe
the
bower
which
he
had
formed
for
her
beneath
a
venerable
that
stood
within
their
father
little
domain
and
at
no
great
distance
from
their
dwelling
an
attempt
had
been
made
at
first
by
the
colonists
to
follow
the
example
of
the
primitive
church
at
jerusalem
and
to
hold
the
land
of
which
they
had
taken
possession
in
common
to
be
worked
by
the
whole
community
and
the
produce
to
be
equally
divided
amongst
their
families
in
due
proportion
but
this
plan
was
soon
abandoned
as
quite
unsuited
to
the
habits
and
manners
of
these
men
of
britain
and
every
family
had
a
small
portion
consisting
of
an
acre
each
assigned
to
it
for
the
special
use
and
maintenance
of
its
members
the
fields
in
every
allotment
had
been
sown
chiefly
with
grain
procured
from
the
friendly
wampanoges
and
for
some
time
past
the
nausetts
had
left
them
unmolested
the
knowledge
which
brewster
soon
acquired
of
the
soft
and
musical
language
of
the
natives
enabled
him
with
the
assistance
of
samoset
who
still
resided
among
them
to
transact
all
business
between
them
and
his
countrymen
and
also
to
become
acquainted
with
the
history
and
circumstances
of
these
useful
allies
he
learnt
that
mooanam
was
not
the
great
sachem
or
sagamore
of
the
whole
tribe
but
that
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
masasoyt
the
king
or
chief
of
the
wampanoges
who
resided
at
packanokick
their
principal
village
which
was
situated
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
near
a
mountain
called
montaup
at
a
considerable
distance
from
patupet
the
native
name
for
new
plymouth
the
means
of
a
still
more
extended
intercourse
was
about
this
time
opened
to
the
settlers
by
the
arrival
at
new
plymouth
of
another
indian
who
was
already
acquainted
with
the
english
and
who
was
also
a
much
greater
proficient
in
their
language
than
their
friend
samoset
this
was
no
other
than
squanto
the
man
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
captain
hunt
some
years
previous
and
conveyed
to
england
during
his
residence
there
he
had
learnt
to
make
himself
understood
in
the
white
man
tongue
and
he
had
also
learnt
to
admire
and
respect
the
white
man
character
when
therefore
he
had
found
his
way
hack
to
his
native
land
in
a
fishing
vessel
and
was
informed
by
the
wampanoge
sagamore
whom
he
visited
in
his
journey
to
rejoin
his
own
tribe
that
an
english
settlement
had
been
formed
on
the
shores
of
cape
cod
bay
he
determined
to
visit
it
masasoyt
encouraged
him
in
this
intention
and
sent
him
to
his
son
mooanam
to
be
introduced
to
the
strangers
and
to
assist
in
forming
a
permanent
alliance
with
them
these
overtures
were
joyfully
received
by
the
governor
mr
carver
and
he
determined
to
take
immediate
advantage
of
this
opportunity
of
adding
to
the
strength
and
security
of
the
infant
colony
the
intended
departure
of
samoset
also
made
it
very
desirable
to
secure
the
friendship
and
the
services
of
the
newcomer
squanto
as
notwithstanding
the
progress
which
winslow
and
some
others
were
making
in
the
wampanoge
language
a
native
interpreter
must
long
be
required
in
order
to
carry
on
a
mutual
intercourse
an
embassy
to
the
great
sagamore
was
therefore
resolved
on
with
a
view
to
confirm
and
strengthen
the
alliance
that
had
been
formed
with
his
sons
and
again
rodolph
was
selected
to
accompany
captain
standish
as
his
while
samoset
and
squanto
were
to
act
as
interpreters
the
journey
was
long
and
maitland
was
obliged
reluctantly
to
refuse
henrich
request
to
attend
him
he
feared
the
fatigue
of
so
many
days
travelling
on
foot
would
be
too
much
for
his
son
strength
and
helen
strongly
opposed
his
going
he
therefore
gave
up
the
much
desired
expedition
and
endeavored
to
chase
away
his
feeling
of
disappointment
by
renewed
exertions
in
ornamenting
the
garden
and
putting
the
grounds
into
a
state
of
perfect
order
to
please
his
father
on
his
return
the
expedition
was
accompanied
by
the
sagamore
younger
son
quadequina
who
was
anxious
to
introduce
the
new
allies
of
his
tribe
to
his
father
and
to
ensure
their
friendly
reception
they
reached
packanokick
after
a
pleasant
journey
of
about
forty
miles
and
were
kindly
welcomed
by
masasoyt
to
whom
a
messenger
had
been
sent
beforehand
to
prepare
him
for
their
arrival
the
sagamore
was
a
old
man
and
was
treated
by
his
son
and
by
all
his
subjects
with
the
most
profound
respect
nor
did
his
strange
costume
in
any
way
destroy
his
kingly
appearance
his
limbs
were
naked
and
were
curiously
painted
and
oiled
and
his
neck
and
arms
were
decorated
with
strings
of
large
white
beads
composed
of
polished
bone
while
a
richly
embroidered
bag
or
pouch
containing
tobacco
was
suspended
at
the
back
of
his
neck
his
coronet
of
feathers
was
lofty
and
of
the
most
brilliant
colors
and
the
rest
of
his
dress
consisted
of
a
tunic
and
moccasins
of
dressed
deer
skin
exquisitely
worked
with
colored
grass
and
porcupine
quills
he
willingly
and
fully
ratified
the
treaty
which
had
been
made
by
his
sons
with
the
white
strangers
whose
appearance
and
manners
seemed
to
prepossess
him
much
in
their
favor
and
after
detaining
them
for
some
days
in
his
lodge
and
entertaining
him
with
the
greatest
hospitality
and
kindness
he
dismissed
them
with
presents
of
native
manufacture
in
return
for
the
european
arms
and
ornaments
which
they
had
offered
to
his
acceptance
samoset
here
left
the
settlers
and
squanto
became
henceforth
their
faithful
friend
and
useful
interpreter

one
evening
about
the
time
that
helen
began
to
expect
the
return
of
the
embassy
from
packanokick
henrich
was
unusually
busy
in
the
garden
arranging
the
and
beautifying
edith
bower
in
which
he
and
his
sister
had
planned
a
little
fête
to
welcome
their
father
home
their
mother
had
learnt
to
feel
that
while
they
were
thus
employed
and
within
the
precincts
of
their
own
domain
they
were
safe
from
every
danger
the
nausetts
had
not
attempted
any
depredations
for
an
unusual
length
of
time
and
a
feeling
of
security
and
peace
had
taken
the
place
of
that
constant
watchfulness
and
anxiety
which
had
long
proved
so
harassing
to
the
settlers
they
began
to
flatter
themselves
that
their
foes
had
retired
from
the
neighborhood
and
would
no
more
return
to
molest
them
now
that
they
knew
the
emigrants
to
be
on
such
friendly
terms
with
their
powerful
rivals
the
wampanoges
but
false
was
this
appearance
of
security
and
vain
was
every
hope
that
the
nausetts
would
forego
their
designs
of
vengeance
or
cease
to
devise
schemes
of
mischief
against
those
by
whom
they
thought
themselves
injured
they
did
not
indeed
continue
to
attack
the
settlement
openly
for
they
had
been
taught
to
dread
the
british
and
the
british
courage
but
they
still
continued
to
lurk
in
the
neighboring
forest
and
to
keep
a
vigilant
watch
over
all
that
took
place
at
the
settlement
often
were
the
keen
eyes
of
coubitant
and
his
most
trusty
followers
fixed
with
a
malignant
gaze
on
the
dwelling
of
rodolph
and
often
were
his
movements
and
those
of
his
family
carefully
noted
by
these
sagacious
savages
when
no
suspicion
of
their
presence
existed
in
the
minds
of
the
settlers
they
would
climb
by
night
to
the
summit
of
some
lofty
tree
that
overlooked
the
village
and
there
remain
all
day
unseen
to
obtain
a
knowledge
of
the
habits
and
proceedings
of
their
hated
enemies
and
to
devise
plans
for
turning
this
knowledge
to
account
the
departure
of
the
embassy
to
packanokick
was
consequently
well
known
to
coubitant
and
he
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
the
absence
of
so
considerable
a
part
of
the
british
force
to
execute
if
possible
his
schemes
of
vengeance
what
they
were
and
how
he
attempted
their
accomplishment

be
presently

edith
bower
looked
gay
with
its
spring
blossoms
and
luxuriant
creepers
but
henrich
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
its
appearance
and
he
wished
to
place
at
its
entrance
a
graceful
climbing
plant
which
he
had
observed
during
his
last
walk
to
the
wampanoge
village
and
had
neglected
to
secure
it
on
his
return
it
had
been
the
desire
of
his
parents
that
he
should
not
go
into
the
forest
which
bordered
their
grounds
except
in
the
company
of
his
father
or
some
of
his
friends
but
the
apparent
departure
of
the
nausetts
had
caused
this
injunction
to
be
neglected
of
late
and
he
and
even
his
younger
brother
and
sister
had
frequently
strayed
unmolested
a
short
distance
into
the
wood
in
search
of
flowers
and
fruits
and
even
helen
had
ceased
to
feel
alarm
said
henrich
on
the
evening
of
which
we
are
speaking
think
my
father
will
return
tonight
or
tomorrow
at
the
farthest
and
i
must
complete
my
task
before
he
arrives
your
bower
still
requires
a
few
plants
to
adorn
the
entrance
and
the
seats
of
moss
are
scarcely
finished
let
us
go
into
the
wood
and
procure
what
we
want
before
the
sun
sets
and
our
mother
comes
out
to
see
what
progress
we
have
made
henrich
replied
his
sister
not
go
this
evening
i
know
not
why
but
the
wood
looks
dark
and
gloomy
there
is
no
sunlight
on
the
path
and
the
shadows
are
so
deep
that
i
could
fancy
every
low
bush
was

crouching
indian
i
can
not
go
into
the
wood
tonight
are
timid
dear
edith
you
never
feared

you
fear

you
shall
help

to
draw
her
from
the
bower
but
she
looked
sad
and
anxious
and
replied
henrich
do
not
ask
me
my
bower
is
fair
enough
and
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
that
old
tree
tonight
for
all
the
flowers
that
grow
in
the
forest
stay
with
me
henrich
dear
our
mother
will
join
us
soon
and
she
will
be
alarmed
if
you
are
not
here
the
boy
looked
at
his
sister
pensive
face
with
an
affectionate
smile
but
he
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
his
scheme
here
then
edith
he
replied
tell
my
mother
that
i
shall
return
in
little
more
than
ten
minutes
come
ludovico
he
added
calling
his
little
brother
who
was
always
ready
to
follow
where
henrich
led
ludovico
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
shadows
bring
your
basket
and
you
shall
gather
moss
while
i
dig
up
my
creeper
when
edith
sees
its
drooping
white
flowers
she
will
forgive
me
for
laughing
at
her
unusual
fears
edith
said
no
more
she
was
sure
that
henrich
knew
best
and
she
silently
watched
him
leave
the
garden
and
enter
the
shade
of
the
thick
forest
accompanied
by
her
joyous
little
brother
were
her
fears
indeed
the
mere
creation
of
her
own
young
fancy
i
or
were
they
occasioned
by
one
of
those
strange
and
unaccountable
presentiments
which
have
been
felt
so
frequently
as
to
justify
the
old
proverb
events
cast
their
shadow
before
edith
sat
on
the
mossy
seat
that
henrich
had
formed
in
her
bower
it
looked
towards
the
wood
and
the
commanding
situation
which
it
occupied
on
a
rising
ground
towards
the
center
of
the
garden
enabled
her
to
overlook
the
green
fence
that
enclosed
the
grounds
and
to
watch
the
receding
forms
of
her
brothers
until
they
were
hidden
from
her
sight
by
the
winding
of
the
path
through
the
underwood
still
she
gazed
and
her
heart
grew
sad
and
tears
which
she
could
not
check
rolled
down
her
cheeks
did
she
again
fancy
and
did
her
tearful
eyes
now
convert
the
bushes
into
the
figures
of
two
dark
indians
in
the
costume
of
the
dreaded
nausetts
surely
those
were
human
forms
that
moved
so
swiftly
and
so
silently
from
the
dark
stem
of
a
gigantic
oak
and
crossing
the
forest
path
were
instantly
again
concealed
edith
wiped
her
glistening
eyes
she
held
her
breath
and
feared
to
move
but
the
beating
of
her
young
heart
was
audible
no
sound
met
her
listening
ear
no
movement
again
was
detected
by
her
straining
eye
and
she
began
to
think
that
her
own
fears
had
conjured
up
those
terrible
forms
but
what
was
that
distant
cry
that
sounded
from
the
wood
in
the
direction
in
which
her
brothers
had
gone
and
why
does
she
now
behold
ludovico
running
wildly
and
alone
down
the
path
with
terror
depicted
in
his
countenance
edith
flew
to
meet
him
but
ere
she
reached
him
the
dreadful
truth
was
made
known
to
her
by
his
agonized
cry
my
brother
my
brother
they
have
taken
him
edith
they
are
dragging
him
away
they
will
kill
him
he
shrieked
aloud
as
he
threw
himself
into
edith
arms
almost
choked
with
the
violence
of
his
feelings
and
the
speed
with
which
he
had
fled
what
could
edith
do
she
dared
not
leave
him
to
be
carried
off
perhaps
by
some
other
prowling
savage
who
might
still
be
lingering
near
and
she
could
not
carry
him
home
slowly
she
drew
him
on
while
every
moment
seemed
an
hour
that
delayed
her
from
giving
the
alarm
and
sending
friends
to
the
rescue
of
her
darling
brother
why
did
he
leave
me
she
murmured
did
he
go
when
i
knew
that
danger
was
near
as
soon
as
she
had
brought
the
panting
and
terrified
ludovico
within
the
precincts
of
the
garden
she
left
him
and
ran
towards
the
house
calling
loudly
on
her
mother
who
rushed
out
on
hearing
her
voice
of
terror
and
was
instantly
made
acquainted
with
the
appalling
fact
that
had
occurred
who
shall
tell
the
agony
of
her
feelings
or
describe
the
sufferings
of
that
mother
heart
when
she
knew
that
her
child
was
in
the
power
of
the
savage
and
relentless
enemies
of
the
white
men
she
was
indeed
ignorant
of
the
peculiar
vengeance
that
they
desired
to
wreak
on
her
husband
and
all
his
race
but
the
malevolent
character
of
the
nausetts
had
been
sufficiently
manifested
in
their
repeated
and
destructive
attacks
on
the
settlement
and
their
willful
desecration
of
the
graves
of
the
exiles
to
awaken
the
most
poignant
fears
in
her
breast
rodolph
too
was
absent
and
brewster
was
still
at
the
wampanoge
village
and
where
should
she
seek
for
succor
or
for
counsel
hastily
calling
janet
who
was
the
only
domestic
at
home
she
committed
ludovico
to
her
care
and
taking
edith
by
the
hand
she
hurried
from
the
garden
scarcely
knowing
whither
she
bent
her
steps
but
in
the
vague
hope
of
meeting
some
of
the
settlers
returning
from
their
labors
in
the
fields
and
inducing
them
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
her
boy
onward
she
fled
along
the
skirts
of
the
forest
towards
the
fields
of
her
husband
friend
winslow
who
she
well
knew
would
aid
her
with
all
his
power
but
she
found
him
not
and
no
human
being
appeared
in
sight
to
listen
to
her
appeal
for
succor
the
sun
was
setting
and
all
had
returned
to
the
village
what
then
could
helen
do
to
retrace
her
steps
and
seek
her
friends
and
neighbors
in
their
homes
would
be
to
lose
precious
moments
on
which
the
life
and
liberty
of
her
henrich
might
depend
to
strike
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
cross
the
belt
of
wood
that
divided
the
settlement
from
mooanam
encampment
would
be
the
quickest
plan
and
probably
the
most
effectual
as
her
wampanoge
friends
would
know
far
better
than
the
settlers
how
to
follow
in
the
train
of
the
fugitives
and
how
either
to
persuade
or
to
compel
them
to
release
their
prisoners
helen
had
never
dared
to
enter
the
wood
except
under
the
protection
of
her
husband
even
in
the
broad
light
of
day
and
now
the
gloom
of
evening
was
gathering
around
her
and
the
path
that
led
into
the
wood
was
obscured
by
the
shadows
of
the
thick
foliage
above
bat
where
were
all
her
fears
and
apprehensions
she
was
unconscious
of
such
feelings
now
the
timid
woman
heart
was
nerved
to
the
occasion
and
no
danger
could
now
make
her
shrink
she
turned
rapidly
into
the
narrow
path
and
pursued
her
way
with
a
firmness
and
decision
of
which
at
any
other
time
when
she
was
trusting
to
the
arm
and
guidance
of
rodolph
she
would
have
believed
herself
incapable
she
knew
the
direction
in
which
the
indian
village
lay
and
the
slanting
rays
of
the
declining
sun
occasionally
penetrated
the
thick
wood
and
cast
bright
streaks
of
light
on
the
mossy
ground
and
the
boles
of
the
giant
trees
around
but
soon
they
faded
away
and
a
deep
gloom
overspread
her
path
said
the
trembling
little
edith
as
she
clung
to
hand
and
exerted
her
utmost
strength
to
keep
up
with
her
rapid
steps
do
you
not
fear
to
pass
through
this
forest
now
shall
we
not
meet
more
of
those
dreadful
savages
who
have
taken
away
my
brother
oh
henrich
henrich
she
cried
while
tears
burst
afresh
from
her
eyes
at
the
recollection
of
her
brother
fate
did
you
venture
into
this
wood
to
seek
plants
for
my
bower
and
the
child
sobbed
convulsively
from
mingled
grief
and
fear
edith
cease
replied
the
deeply
distressed
but
now
firm
and
courageous
helen
fear
nothing
while
i
am
seeking
aid
for
henrich
god
will
protect
us
my
child
she
added
and
she
raised
her
glistening
eyes
to
heaven
and
gazed
hopefully
and
trustingly
on
one
bright
star
that
shone
upon
her
between
the
summits
of
the
lofty
trees
her
heart
was
strengthened
by
her
pious
confidence
in
her
heavenly
father
she
remembered
also
that
edith
looked
to
her
for
protection
and
all
personal
fears
were
absorbed
by
that
generous
and
elevating
feeling
of
which
is
shared
even
by
the
lower
and
weaker
animals
when
their
offspring
are
in
danger
so
helen
forgot
herself
and
felt
strong
to
guard
her
child
and
strong
to
seek
and
obtain
aid
for
him
whose
peril
was
more
real
and
urgent
onward
she
pressed
in
silence
but
her
soul
was
pleading
eloquently
with
god
soon
edith
checked
her
suddenly
and
exclaimed
as
she
stumbled
over
something
in
the
pathway
mother
here
are
henrich
tools
and
there
i
see
ludovico
basket
full
of
moss
this
is
the
spot
to
which
my
brothers
were
coming
and
yonder
is
the
old
tree
with
the
white
flowers
hanging
on
it
that
henrich
wished
to
plant
by
my
bower
it
must
have
been
here
that
the
indians
seized
him
while
he
was
at
work
that
part
of
the
wood
was
more
light
and
open
than
the
rest
of
their
way
had
been
and
helen
hastily
surveyed
it
that
she
might
be
able
to
guide
the
wampanoges
thither
and
point
out
to
them
where
to
commence
the
pursuit
again
she
resumed
her
way
and
regardless
of
fatigue
she
never
paused
again
until
she
reached
the
border
of
the
quiet
and
lonely
lake
on
which
the
rising
moon
was
now
shining
in
all
her
silvery
splendor
the
huts
of
the
friendly
natives
stood
out
clear
and
dark
on
the
level
shore
of
the
lake
and
helen
and
her
weary
child
soon
reached
them
and
hastened
to
lodge
there
they
found
the
chief
and
his
interesting
young
wife
and
children
sitting
on
the
matted
floor
listening
with
deep
attention
to
the
words
of
life
and
salvation
which
brewster
was
reading
and
interpreting
to
them
from
the
holy
scriptures
the
hurried
entrance
of
helen
startled
and
alarmed
them
for
her
countenance
plainly
told
them
that
some
calamity
had
occasioned
her
appearance
at
such
an
unwonted
time
with
breathless
haste
she
told
her
sad
errand
and
brewster
quickly
explained
her
words
to
the
chief
mooanam
seized
his
arms
and
rushed
from
the
lodge
calling
in
a
loud
and
commanding
voice
on
his
people
to
arm
themselves
and
accompany
him
in
the
pursuit
of
the
cruel
and
vindictive
nausetts
all
was
hurry
and
excitement
throughout
the
village
and
every
swarthy
warrior
pressed
forward
and
desired
to
share
in
the
expedition
to
save
their
young
english
favorite
it
was
necessary
however
to
leave
a
strong
party
at
the
village
to
guard
it
from
any
act
of
treachery
or
violence
on
the
part
of
their
malicious
rivals
who
it
was
now
evident
were
still
lurking
in
the
neighborhood
and
while
mooanam
was
selecting
his
party
and
arranging
his
plans
a
clear
shrill
voice
was
heard
from
the
margin
of
the
lake
crying
canoes
the
canoes
quadequina
is
returning
canoes
the
canoes
resounded
through
the
crowd
and
heart
hounded
with
joy
and
gratitude
rodolph
was
near
and
all
would
yet
be
well
little
nepea
had
led
edith
to
the
shore
while
the
warriors
were
discussing
their
plans
and
in
a
strange
mixture
of
english
and
indian
words
the
children
were
conversing
on
the
recent
sad
event
the
quick
ear
of
the
young
savage
had
detected
the
splash
of
oars
at
the
farther
side
of
the
lake
and
he
instantly
discovered
the
three
canoes
that
were
leaving
the
opposite
coast
and
emerging
from
the
deep
shadow
of
the
overhanging
trees
he
had
raised
that
joyful
cry
and
now
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
rushed
down
to
the
shore
to
welcome
their
brethren
and
to
tell
the
startling
news
nearest
to
the
brink
stood
helen
and
her
little
girl
closely
attended
by
mooanam
and
the
apannow
who
shared
her
impatient
anxiety
for
the
return
of
the
embassy
that
they
might
have
the
benefit
of
maitland
counsel
and
also
obtain
an
addition
to
their
forces
the
elder
brewster
was
deeply
moved
at
the
misfortune
that
had
befallen
his
young
friend
henrich
but
he
knew
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
and
while
all
others
were
crowding
down
to
the
lake
side
he
busied
him
self
in
arranging
the
volunteers
for
the
pursuit
and
seeing
that
his
own
musket
was
in
a
proper
state
for
active
service
the
canoes
sped
swiftly
across
the
moonlit
waters
and
as
they
neared
the
shore
rodolph
perceived
the
forms
of
his
wife
and
daughter
surrounded
by
the
dark
indians
and
ready
to
receive
him
but
he
felt
only
pleasure
at
this
unexpected
and
welcome
meeting
no
feeling
of
alarm
crossed
his
breast
until
he
drew
near
enough
to
distinguish
helen
countenance
and
then
he
knew
that
she
had
come
with
evil
tidings
he
sprang
from
the
canoe
eager
to
hear
the
truth
but
all
the
firmness
and
courage
which
had
so
wonderfully
sustained
his
wife
while
she
was
obliged
to
act
for
herself
forsook
her
the
moment
she
felt
herself
supported
by
her
rodolph
arm
and
faintly
exclaiming
my
son
my
son
she
fainted
while
little
edith
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
out
her
brother
name
me
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
all
this
means
exclaimed
maitland
turning
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
on
mooanam
who
stood
with
characteristic
silence
and
apparent
composure
waiting
the
proper
moment
to
speak
me
cried
the
distracted
father
again
dire
calamity
has
befallen
my
boy
heart
is
dark
for
you
replied
the
sachem
in
a
voice
of
perfect
calmness
though
a
tear
glistened
in
his
coal
black
eye
and
his
brow
was
clouded
by
anxiety
heart
is
very
dark
for
you
and
for
your
young
warrior
for
boy
as
he
was
he
was
a
brave
at
heart
mooanam
spoke
in
his
native
tongue
intermixed
with
english
words
and
phrases
which
he
had
learned
from
brewster
and
the
other
settlers
but
the
father
heart
comprehended
all
he
said
and
needed
no
interpreter
my
son
dead
then
he
exclaimed
accident
or
violence
quenched
his
young
spirit
than
dead
slowly
replied
the
sachem
and
he
looked
pityingly
at
helen
who
now
began
to
recover
her
senses
your
wife
to
the
care
of
the
squaws
he
added
come
with
me
to
the
wise
man
yonder
and
he
will
tell
you
all
he
led
rodolph
to
where
brewster
was
occupied
in
making
preparations
and
soon
the
afflicted
father
was
made
acquainted
with
the
fate
of
his
son
he
felt
indeed
that
death
a
calm
and
peaceful
death
beneath
his
own
accustomed
roof
and
with
those
he
dearly
loved
around
him
would
have
been
a
far
happier
lot
for
henrich
than
that
to
which
he
now
feared
he
might
be
doomed
than
that
which
possibly
his
darling
boy
was
at
that
moment
enduring
at
the
hands
of
his
cruel
and
malignant
enemies
the
thought
was
maddening
but
there
was
still
a
hope
of
saving
him
by
speed
and
resolution
and
he
urged
the
sachem
to
depart
instantly
one
moment
he
gave
to
visit
and
endeavor
to
cheer
his
wife
who
now
lay
powerless
and
weeping
in
apannow
lodge
and
then
he
joined
the
chief
who
with
brewster
and
a
band
of
picked
men
were
ready
to
accompany
him
the
pastor
had
already
learnt
from
edith
all
that
she
could
tell
relative
to
the
spot
where
her
brother
had
been
captured
and
to
that
spot
the
pursuing
party
hurried
and
soon
discovered
the
basket
and
the
tools
that
told
where
the
boys
had
been
so
rudely
interrupted
in
their
work
quickly
the
trodden
grass
and
the
broken
branches
of
the
thick
underwood
showed
in
what
direction
the
boy
had
been
dragged
by
his
captors
and
on
the
track
the
wampanoge
warriors
followed
like
hounds
in
the
chase
but
alas
the
nausetts
had
had
a
fearful
start
of
them
and
little
hope
existed
in
the
breast
of
mooanam
that
they
could
overtake
them
in
time
to
avert
the
dreadful
fate
that
he
had
feared
for
henrich
the
sachem
was
himself
an
indian
and
he
well
knew
the
indian
desire
for
retaliation
and
vengeance
he
was
indeed
a
man
of
a
mild
and
generous
nature
and
he
belonged
to
a
tribe
less
distinguished
by
cruelty
than
the
nausetts
but
still
he
felt
that
according
to
the
savage
code
of
the
natives
blood
must
atone
for
blood
and
he
believed
that
already
the
life
of
henrich
had
probably
been
sacrificed
in
expiation
of
his
father
having
slain
the
son
of
the
nausett
chief
still
he
led
his
warriors
on
and
neither
paused
nor
spoke
until
the
party
emerged
from
the
thick
wood
upon
a
little
opening
that
was
lighted
up
brilliantly
by
the
here
where
it
was
evident
a
small
temporary
encampment
had
existed
and
had
only
been
very
recently
and
hastily
removed
he
stopped
and
looked
earnestly
around
the
poles
still
stood
erect
which
lied
supported
the
tents
of
the
nausetts
the
fires
were
still
burning
and
many
articles
of
domestic
use
lay
scattered
about
which
the
hasty
departure
of
the
inhabitants
had
probably
prevented
their
removing
rudolph
hurried
through
the
camp
in
search
of
some
sign
of
his
son
and
his
eager
eye
fell
on
the
tunic
that
henrich
was
accustomed
to
wear
he
snatched
it
up
hastily
and
then
with
a
deep
groan
let
it
fall
again
upon
the
ground
the
breast
of
the
tunic
was
pierced
through
in
several
places
and
the
whole
dress
was
stained
with
blood
blood
that
was
newly
shed
maitland
pointed
to
this
evidence
of
his
son
death
and
when
the
sachem
had
examined
it
he
set
his
teeth
together
and
drew
in
his
breath
with
an
oppressed
hissing
sound
as
of
severe
pain
is
over
my
friend
he
said
in
a
low
deep
voice
to
rodolph
is
over
and
we
are
too
late
naught
now
remains
but
to
take
revenge
full
ample
revenge
let
us
follow
the
miscreants
rudolph
turned
and
looked
at
him
he
fixed
on
him
such
a
searching
gaze
a
gaze
so
full
of
gentle
reproof
and
of
deep
settled
the
chief
stood
silent
and
almost
abashed
before
his
christian
friend
it
thus
you
have
learned
of
brewster
said
the
sorrowing
father
it
thus
that
you
are
taught
in
that
book
which
the
great
spirit
has
dictated
the
father
of
us
all
has
declared
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
and
since
we
are
too
late
to
save
my
son
we
will
not
commit
deeds
of
blood
which
his
now
happy
and
ransomed
spirit
would
abhor
mooanam
was
silenced
but
not
convinced
inwardly
he
vowed
vengeance
against
those
who
had
dealt
so
cruelly
with
the
unoffending
boy
though
under
similar
circumstances
he
would
probably
have
acted
with
the
same
spirit
but
the
chief
bad
allied
himself
with
the
white
men
he
loved
and
reverenced
them
and
he
was
resolved
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
maitland
as
if
they
had
been
his
own
sadly
and
silently
the
party
returned
to
the
indian
village
where
they
arrived
at
the
break
of
day
we
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
mother
anguish
when
she
was
made
acquainted
with
the
dreaded
fate
of
her
son
but
helen
was
a
christian
and
while
her
heart
was
bowed
down
with
crushing
grief
her
spirit
strove
to
hush
its
rebellious
questionings
and
to
submit
itself
to
the
will
of
god
is
the
lord
she
meekly
exclaimed
him
do
what
seemeth
him
good
that
morning
she
returned
with
her
husband
and
edith
to
the
settlement
and
they
were
accompanied
by
brewster
whose
pious
exhortations
and
sympathizing
kindness
were
invaluable
to
the
bereaved
and
afflicted
parents
the
grief
of
edith
was
less
capable
of
being
suppressed
and
it
broke
out
afresh
when
little
ludovico
came
to
meet
them
and
inquired
for
his
brother
from
the
child
they
learnt
that
while
he
and
henrich
were
busily
engaged
in
their
several
occupations
in
the
wood
two
indians
had
suddenly
rushed
from
the
thick
brushwood
and
seized
on
his
brother
before
he
had
time
to
fly
ludovico
was
gathering
moss
at
some
distance
but
he
saw
what
passed
and
uttered
a
cry
that
attracted
the
attention
of
the
savages
and
one
of
them
east
a
spear
at
him
with
such
violence
that
missing
its
intended
mark
it
stuck
firmly
in
a
tree
close
behind
him
seeing
this
his
noble
and
courageous
brother
called
out
to
him
to
hide
among
the
bushes
and
make
his
way
home
as
quickly
as
possible
and
the
indians
eager
to
secure
the
prize
they
had
so
long
been
watching
for
hurried
away
through
the
forest
dragging
henrich
with
them
the
murderous
attempt
made
by
these
savages
against
the
life
of
ludovico
proved
but
too
clearly
that
the
destruction
of
children
was
their
object
and
banished
every
hope
that
lingered
in
helen
breast
and
this
conviction
of
their
cruel
intentions
was
still
further
confirmed
by
janet
account
of
the
look
and
gesture
of
the
warrior
who
attended
his
chief
when
the
nausetts
first
assailed
the
settlement
rodolph
had
seen
and
understood
the
action
and
as
he
had
also
learnt
through
his
wampanoge
friends
that
tekoa
the
son
of
the
nausett
chief
had
fallen
in
the
first
encounter
he
knew
enough
of
indian
customs
to
be
aware
that
he
as
the
slayer
was
a
marked
object
of
their
vengeance
he
had
however
always
concealed
his
suspicions
from
helen
and
the
only
effect
they
had
produced
on
him
was
causing
him
at
that
time
to
prohibit
his
children
from
venturing
unguarded
into
the
wood
more
strictly
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
chapter
the
wrath
of
man
shall
praise
thee
the
remainder
of
wrath
shalt
thou
restrain
psa
we
will
now
for
a
time
leave
the
settlement
where
the
sad
news
of
the
capture
and
supposed
death
of
henrich
had
spread
a
general
gloom
and
consternation
and
follow
the
subject
of
their
pitying
grief
from
the
time
that
he
was
seized
and
made
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
savages
they
did
not
slay
him
for
the
lord
had
work
and
service
in
store
for
the
young
missionary
and
he
suffered
not
a
hair
of
his
head
to
be
hurt
coubitant
for
he
was
one
of
those
whose
patient
vigilance
had
at
length
been
crowned
by
success
and
his
companion
had
hurried
him
at
their
greatest
speed
through
the
wood
to
the
spot
where
their
temporary
camp
was
pitched
and
where
several
others
of
their
tribe
awaited
their
return
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
remove
the
matting
that
formed
their
tents
and
to
collect
their
arms
and
utensils
but
coubitant
well
knew
that
the
child
who
had
escaped
his
cruelty
would
soon
alarm
the
settlers
and
that
an
instant
pursuit
would
follow
he
therefore
devised
plan
to
deceive
and
perhaps
altogether
to
check
the
white
men
at
least
for
a
time
by
making
them
believe
that
the
death
of
the
captive
had
already
taken
place
he
would
have
instantly
gratified
the
feelings
of
his
cruel
and
revengeful
heart
and
have
shed
the
innocent
blood
of
rodolph
son
to
atone
for
the
death
of
his
friend
but
that
he
feared
to
disappoint
his
chief
who
so
earnestly
desired
to
imbrue
his
own
hands
in
the
blood
of
the
slayer
he
therefore
resolved
on
the
stratagem
we
have
described
he
stripped
off
the
captive
tunic
and
after
piercing
it
several
times
with
his
dagger
he
opened
a
vein
in
his
own
arm
with
the
same
weapon
and
let
the
hot
blood
flow
freely
over
the
torn
vesture
this
done
he
smiled
a
demon
smile
as
he
cast
the
tunic
on
the
ground
and
thought
with
malignant
pleasure
of
the
anguish
that
its
discovery
would
occasion
to
his
hated
foe
henrich
gazed
in
trembling
wonder
at
this
act
and
when
coubitant
again
approached
him
to
bind
his
hands
he
believed
that
he
was
about
to
plunge
that
knife
into
his
beating
heart
he
was
young
and
life
was
new
and
precious
to
him
and
for
a
moment
he
shrank
back
while
the
blood
curdled
in
his
veins
but
young
as
he
was
he
was
also
a
child
of
god
and
he
knew
that
all
events
are
governed
by
his
almighty
power
and
by
his
wisdom
and
love
so
he
was
enabled
to
lift
up
his
eyes
and
his
trusting
heart
to
heaven
and
to
await
his
expected
fate
with
calmness
coubitant
saw
his
firmness
and
he
wondered
and
admired
he
placed
the
dagger
in
his
belt
and
hastily
tying
the
captive
hands
behind
his
back
he
motioned
to
his
companions
to
follow
and
struck
into
a
narrow
and
almost
undistinguishable
path
forcing
henrich
to
go
before
him
while
he
held
the
rope
of
twisted
grass
that
bound
his
hands
he
followed
close
behind
and
placed
his
foot
in
each
print
that
the
prisoner
made
so
as
to
destroy
the
impression
of
the
boy
european
shoe
the
other
indians
did
the
same
as
exactly
did
they
tread
in
one
another
steps
that
when
all
had
passed
it
seemed
as
if
only
one
solitary
traveler
had
left
his
track
on
the
soft
ground
thus
indian
file
they
traversed
a
belt
of
wood
till
they
came
out
on
a
dry
and
plain
where
their
steps
left
no
impression
coubitant
then
advanced
to
the
side
of
his
prisoner
and
taking
his
arm
in
his
powerful
grasp
he
compelled
him
to
advance
at
an
almost
breathless
speed
across
the
plain
in
the
wood
on
the
other
side
he
allowed
a
short
pause
and
gave
henrich
some
water
from
a
bottle
made
of
a
dried
gourd
which
hung
about
his
neck
and
thus
they
traveled
on
with
slight
refreshment
and
little
rest
until
the
sun
arose
in
all
his
splendor
and
displayed
to
henrich
admiring
gaze
the
wild
and
magnificent
woodland
scenery
through
which
he
was
travelling
under
other
circumstances
he
would
keenly
have
enjoyed
the
novelty
and
the
beauty
of
the
objects
that
met
his
eyes
so
different
from
the
luxuriant
but
flat
and
monotonous
fields
and
gardens
and
canals
that
he
so
well
remembered
in
holland
here
all
was
wild
and
varied
and
all
was
on
a
scale
of
grandeur
that
inspired
him
with
a
feeling
of
awe
and
solemnity
heightened
no
doubt
by
the
fearful
uncertainty
of
his
fate
and
the
thought
that
perhaps
this
was
the
last
time
that
he
should
look
upon
these
glorious
hills
and
ancient
forests
and
wide
rushing
rivers
the
handiworks
and
the
visible
teachers
of
power
something
of
american
scenery
he
had
become
acquainted
with
in
his
rambles
round
the
indian
village
but
only
enough
to
make
him
long
to
see
more
and
had
he
now
been
travelling
by
the
side
of
his
father
or
his
friend
brewster
the
elastic
morning
air
and
the
splendid
and
views
would
have
made
his
young
heart
bound
with
joy
and
health
as
it
was
the
silent
beauty
of
nature
was
not
without
its
influence
on
the
captive
boy
he
seemed
to
feel
more
strongly
the
presence
and
the
goodness
of
his
heavenly
father
and
his
young
spirit
was
cheered
to
endure
his
present
desolate
situation
and
strengthened
to
meet
whatever
future
trials
might
await
him
he
had
learnt
from
brewster
to
make
himself
understood
in
the
wampanoge
language
and
he
resolved
to
try
whether
his
nausett
guide
would
reply
to
his
questions
in
that
tongue
he
therefore
besought
him
to
tell
him
whither
he
was
leading
him
and
for
what
purpose
but
coubitant
deigned
him
no
reply
he
understood
him
for
the
nausett
language
was
but
another
dialect
of
the
wampanoge
but
he
did
not
choose
to
inform
the
boy
of
his
destination
at
present
and
he
preserved
a
profound
silence
and
an
expression
of
sullen
gravity
it
was
not
until
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
that
the
party
reached
the
nausett
village
which
as
we
have
already
observed
was
situate
near
the
site
of
the
encounter
and
to
which
tisquantum
and
the
greater
part
of
his
warriors
had
returned
when
coubitant
and
a
few
picked
associates
were
left
to
carry
out
his
schemes
of
vengeance
henrich
was
instantly
conducted
to
the
lodge
of
the
old
chief
and
brightly
did
tisquantum
dark
eyes
glitter
when
he
beheld
the
son
of
his
enemy
in
his
power
he
praised
the
skill
and
the
perseverance
by
which
coubitant
had
thus
procured
him
the
means
of
revenge
and
taking
off
his
own
brilliant
coronet
of
feathers
he
placed
it
on
the
head
of
the
proud
and
successful
warrior
as
a
distinguished
mark
of
his
approbation
coubitant
was
highly
gratified
but
his
desire
for
vengeance
was
stronger
than
his
vanity
and
forgetting
the
honor
that
had
been
conferred
upon
him
he
entreated
the
chief
to
allow
him
instantly
to
drive
his
spear
into
the
boy
heart
or
else
with
his
own
weapon
to
take
the
life
of
the
slayer
child
yet
replied
tisquantum
and
henrich
comprehended
the
full
purport
of
his
words
today
coubitant
i
would
pour
out
the
blood
of
the
white
youth
with
pomp
and
ceremony
as
an
offering
to
the
spirit
of
my
murdered
son
let
the
boy
be
fed
and
refreshed
tomorrow
at
break
of
day
he
shall
die
go
i
have
said
it
will
the
sachem
give
him
into
my
charge
until
the
morning
dawns
inquired
coubitant
tisquantum
fixed
his
piercing
eye
on
the
savage
and
read
his
malevolent
feelings
and
he
calmly
answered
the
victim
shall
bleed
because
his
father
blood
flows
in
his
veins
but
he
shall
not
be
tortured
for
his
was
not
the
hand
that
deprived
me
of
my
son
the
boy
shall
remain
in
my
own
lodge
and
sleep
securely
for
this
night
beneath
the
same
roof
that
shelters
my
last
remaining
child
my
lovely
oriana
had
the
chief
observed
henrich
changing
countenance
he
would
have
perceived
that
all
he
said
was
understood
by
the
intended
sufferer
but
he
marked
him
not
and
the
boy
commanded
himself
and
kept
silence
determined
to
await
coubitant
departure
before
he
made
one
effort
to
move
the
chief
to
pity
he
had
however
no
opportunity
of
trying
the
effect
of
his
earnest
appeal
for
tisquantum
ordered
one
of
his
attendants
to
remove
him
at
once
to
the
inner
division
of
the
lodge
and
to
secure
him
there
for
the
night
and
then
motioning
coubitant
to
retire
and
resuming
his
pipe
he
proceeded
to
smoke
as
composedly
as
if
his
evening
repose
had
not
been
interrupted
but
notwithstanding
his
outward
composure
the
nausett
chief
was
not
unmoved
by
the
event
that
had
just
occurred
the
sight
of
the
son
of
him
whose
hand
had
slain
his
young
tekoa
brought
back
the
image
of
his
brave
young
warrior
as
he
stood
beside
him
at
the
fatal
full
of
youthful
ardor
to
combat
the
invaders
of
his
land
and
the
supposed
enemies
of
his
race
he
recalled
his
daring
look
as
he
mounted
the
palisade
and
placed
in
his
unerring
bow
the
arrow
that
wounded
the
english
boy
and
then
he
seemed
to
hear
again
the
sharp
report
of
the
white
man
musket
and
to
behold
once
more
the
sudden
fall
of
his
son
bleeding
and
expiring
to
the
ground
tisquantum
thought
on
that
hour
of
anguish
when
his
duties
as
a
chief
and
a
warrior
had
forbidden
all
expression
of
his
grief
and
he
thought
of
his
return
to
his
lodge
where
only
oriana
remained
to
welcome
him
for
the
mother
of
his
children
whom
he
had
loved
with
unusual
affection
was
dead
and
tears
gathered
in
the
sachem
eyes
oriana
had
deeply
mourned
her
brother
death
for
since
she
had
lost
her
mother
she
had
been
permitted
to
enjoy
much
more
of
his
society
than
had
previously
been
allowed
her
and
her
father
also
had
seemed
to
transfer
to
her
much
of
the
love
that
be
had
borne
towards
his
wife
now
his
daughter
was
his
only
domestic
tie
and
his
chief
object
in
life
was
to
give
her
in
marriage
to
a
warrior
as
brave
as
her
young
brother
and
who
would
supply
to
him
the
place
of
his
departed
son
at
present
this
prospect
was
not
immediate
for
oriana
was
only
in
her
fourteenth
year
but
the
sachem
was
resolved
that
she
should
be
worthy
of
the
hand
of
the
greatest
warriors
of
her
tribe
and
he
took
pains
to
have
her
instructed
in
every
art
that
was
considered
valuable
or
ornamental
to
an
indian
female
already
she
could
perform
the
most
elaborate
patterns
in
native
embroidery
on
her
father
pouches
and
moccasins
and
her
own
garments
were
also
delicately
and
fancifully
adorned
in
the
same
manner
with
feathers
and
shells
and
colored
grasses
besides
this
accomplishment
her
skill
in
indian
cookery
was
very
great
and
she
could
also
use
a
bow
and
arrows
or
cast
a
light
javelin
or
swim
across
a
rapid
river
with
a
grace
and
activity
that
delighted
her
proud
father
oriana
too
was
gentle
as
gentle
as
her
mother
and
her
influence
over
tisquantum
bade
fair
to
equal
that
which
his
and
deeply
regretted
wife
had
exercised
over
him
that
influence
had
ever
been
employed
in
the
cause
of
mercy
and
many
an
enemy
and
many
a
subject
had
lived
to
bless
the
name
of
the
oriana
when
she
had
quelled
the
wrath
of
the
offended
chief
and
turned
aside
his
intended
vengeance
it
was
to
the
inner
apartment
of
his
spacious
lodge
where
his
daughter
and
her
attendants
were
busily
engaged
in
their
domestic
occupations
that
henrich
bad
been
led
his
arms
were
still
tied
behind
his
back
and
the
end
of
the
rope
that
bound
them
was
secured
to
a
post
in
the
wall
the
indian
who
at
his
chief
command
conducted
him
thither
briefly
informed
oriana
that
he
was
a
prisoner
and
desired
her
women
to
look
to
his
security
and
then
he
left
the
captive
to
his
strange
and
inquisitive
jailers
when
tisquantum
had
emptied
his
long
pipe
he
bethought
himself
of
the
young
captive
position
and
proceeded
to
his
daughter
apartment
to
give
orders
for
his
hospitable
entertainment
that
evening
and
his
safe
lodgment
for
the
night
that
night
which
he
was
resolved
should
be
his
last
as
he
approached
the
thick
curtain
of
that
hung
over
the
aperture
between
the
two
apartments
he
thought
he
heard
a
strange
sweet
voice
speaking
the
indian
language
with
a
foreign
accent
and
hastily
drawing
aside
the
heavy
drapery
he
was
astonished
to
see
his
prisoner
and
intended
victim
liberated
from
the
cord
that
had
bound
him
and
reclining
on
the
furs
and
cushions
that
formed
oriana
usual
while
his
gentle
indian
child
knelt
beside
him
and
offered
him
the
food
of
which
he
was
so
much
in
need
henrich
was
gratefully
thanking
her
and
as
the
sachem
entered
he
heard
him
exclaim
in
mournful
accents
why
do
you
thus
so
kindly
treat
me
it
were
better
to
let
me
die
of
hunger
and
fatigue
for
i
know
that
my
blood
is
to
be
shed
the
cold
knife
is
to
pierce
my
heart
shall
not
be
replied
oriana
fervently
have
said
that
i
will
save
you
and
then
she
raised
her
sparkling
eyes
as
she
heard
her
father
entrance
and
springing
on
her
feet
she
darted
forward
and
caught
his
arm
she
cried
and
now
she
spoke
so
rapidly
and
energetically
that
henrich
could
only
guess
the
purport
of
her
words
and
read
it
in
her
sweet
expressive
countenance
do
not
slay
the
white
boy
he
says
that
he
is
doomed
to
die
because
his
father
caused
my
death
but
surely
tekoa
generous
spirit
does
not
ask
the
blood
of
a
child
my
brother
is
now
happy
in
the
great
hunting
grounds
where
our
fathers
dwell
he
feels
no
wrath
against
his
slayer
son
he
never
would
have
sought
revenge
against
an
innocent
boy
give
me
the
captive
o
my
father
and
let
him
grow
up
in
our
lodge
and
be
to
me
a
playfellow
and
a
brother
tisquantum
gazed
at
his
child
in
wonder
and
his
countenance
softened
she
saw
that
he
was
moved
and
hastily
turning
from
him
she
approached
henrich
who
had
risen
from
the
couch
and
now
stood
an
earnest
spectator
of
the
scene
on
the
issue
of
which
his
life
or
death
humanly
speaking
depended
she
took
his
band
and
led
him
to
her
father
and
again
pleaded
earnestly
and
passionately
for
his
life
while
the
touching
expression
of
his
own
deep
blue
eyes
and
the
beauty
of
his
fair
young
face
added
greatly
to
the
power
of
her
appeal
i
have
a
little
sister
at
home
said
henrich
and
the
soft
indian
language
sounded
sweetly
from
his
foreign
lips
she
will
weep
for
me
as
oriana
has
wept
for
her
brother
let
me
return
to
patupet
and
she
and
my
parents
will
bless
you
at
the
mention
of
his
parents
tisquantum
brow
grew
dark
again
he
thought
of
rodolph
as
the
destroyer
of
his
son
and
he
turned
away
from
the
two
youthful
suppliants
whose
silent
eloquence
he
felt
he
could
not
long
resist
father
killed
my
young
tekoa
he
replied
fire
weapon
quenched
the
light
of
my
lodge
and
took
from
me
the
support
of
my
old
age
should
i
have
pity
on
his
son
let
him
dwell
in
our
lodge
and
fill
my
brother
vacant
place
exclaimed
oriana
not
send
him
back
to
the
white
men
and
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
little
sister
will
still
weep
for
him
and
believe
him
dead
the
same
idea
had
crossed
tisquantum
breast
he
looked
again
at
the
boy
and
thought
how
much
oriana
life
would
be
cheered
by
such
a
companion
his
desire
of
revenge
on
rodolph
would
also
be
gratified
by
detaining
his
child
and
bringing
him
up
as
an
indian
so
long
as
his
parents
believed
that
he
had
met
with
a
bloody
death
and
possibly
he
felt
a
time
might
come
when
the
possession
of
an
english
captive
might
prove
advantageous
to
himself
and
his
tribe
all
fear
of
the
escaping
to
his
friends
was
removed
from
his
mind
for
he
was
about
to
retire
from
that
part
of
the
country
to
a
wild
district
far
to
the
west
and
to
join
his
allies
the
pequodees
in
a
hunting
expedition
to
some
distant
prairies
the
portion
of
his
tribe
over
which
he
was
sachem
or
chief
was
willing
to
accompany
him
and
he
had
no
intention
of
returning
again
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
english
intruders
who
he
clearly
foresaw
would
ere
long
make
themselves
masters
of
the
soil
and
who
had
already
secured
to
themselves
such
powerful
allies
in
the
wampanoges
the
enemies
and
rivals
of
the
nausetts
tisquantum
weighed
all
these
considerations
in
his
mind
and
he
resolved
to
spare
the
life
of
his
young
captive
but
he
would
not
at
once
announce
that
he
had
relented
from
his
bloody
purpose
and
yielded
to
his
child
solicitations
he
therefore
maintained
the
severe
gravity
that
usually
marked
his
countenance
and
replied
what
can
the
white
boy
do
that
he
should
fill
the
place
of
an
indian
chieftain
son
can
he
cast
the
spear
or
draw
the
bow
or
wrestle
with
our
brave
youths
reviving
hope
had
filled
the
heart
of
henrich
with
courage
and
he
looked
boldly
up
into
the
sachem
face
and
merely
answered
me
the
brevity
and
the
calmness
of
the
reply
pleased
the
red
chief
and
he
determined
to
take
him
at
his
word
will
he
said
you
shall
show
what
skill
you
possess
and
your
fate
shall
depend
on
your
success
but
how
have
you
learned
anything
of
indian
sports
or
of
the
indian
tongue
have
been
much
in
mooanam
lodge
and
have
played
with
the
youths
of
his
village
replied
henrich
the
sachem
was
well
pleased
to
see
me
use
a
bow
and
arrow
in
his
woods
and
from
him
and
my
young
companions
i
learnt
to
speak
their
tongue
is
good
said
the
old
chief
thoughtfully
then
fixing
his
penetrating
eyes
on
henrich
again
he
hastily
inquired
can
you
use
the
weapons
of
your
countrymen
and
can
you
teach
me
to
make
them
can
use
them
answered
the
boy
i
can
not
make
them
they
come
from
my
father
land
beyond
the
great
sea
but
he
added
while
a
stronger
hope
of
life
and
liberty
beamed
in
his
bright
blue
eye
and
flushing
face
me
back
to
my
countrymen
and
they
will
give
you
muskets
for
my
ransom
no
said
the
sachem
and
the
dark
cloud
again
passed
over
his
countenance
will
i
restore
you
to
your
father
till
he
can
give
me
back
my
son
you
shall
live
if
you
can
use
our
indian
weapons
but
you
shall
live
and
die
as
an
indian
he
turned
and
left
the
apartment
and
the
heart
of
henrich
sank
within
him
was
he
then
taken
for
ever
from
his
parents
and
his
brother
and
sister
should
he
behold
his
friends
and
his
teacher
no
more
and
must
he
dwell
with
savages
and
lead
a
savage
life
death
he
thought
would
be
preferable
to
such
a
lot
and
he
half
resolved
to
conceal
his
skill
and
dexterity
in
indian
exercises
that
tisquantum
might
cast
him
off
and
slay
him
as
unfit
to
dwell
among
his
tribe
but
hope
soon
revived
and
his
trust
in
the
providential
mercy
of
god
restored
his
spirits
and
enabled
him
even
to
look
upon
a
lengthened
captivity
among
the
red
men
with
composure
plans
for
escaping
out
of
their
hands
and
making
his
way
back
to
the
settlement
filled
his
mind
and
a
short
residence
among
the
wild
men
even
appeared
to
offer
some
attraction
to
his
enterprising
spirit
so
he
turned
to
oriana
who
stood
gazing
on
his
changing
and
expressive
countenance
with
the
deepest
interest
and
again
resumed
the
conversation
which
had
been
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
chief
many
questions
did
those
young
strangers
ask
each
other
relative
to
their
respective
homes
and
native
customs
and
henrich
learnt
with
much
dismay
that
the
nausetts
under
tisquantum
rule
were
so
soon
to
change
their
place
of
residence
his
hopes
of
escape
became
less
strong
but
they
were
not
destroyed
and
when
he
was
summoned
to
pass
the
night
in
the
sachem
apartment
he
was
able
to
lift
up
his
heart
to
god
in
prayer
and
to
lie
down
to
sleep
on
the
rude
couch
prepared
for
him
with
a
calm
trust
in
his
almighty
power
and
goodness
and
a
hope
that
he
would
see
fit
to
shorten
his
trials
and
restore
him
to
his
friends
the
chief
watched
him
as
he
knelt
in
prayer
and
when
he
rose
and
prepared
to
lie
down
to
sleep
he
abruptly
asked
him
why
he
had
thus
remained
on
his
knees
so
long
was
praying
to
my
god
to
protect
me
answered
henrich
and
a
tear
rose
to
his
eye
as
he
remembered
how
he
had
knelt
every
evening
with
his
own
beloved
family
and
thought
how
his
absence
and
their
probable
belief
in
his
death
would
sadden
the
act
of
worship
that
would
that
night
be
performed
in
his
father
house
you
pray
to
the
great
spirit
asked
tisquantum
do
replied
the
young
christian
pray
to
the
great
spirit
who
is
the
god
and
father
of
all
men
and
i
pray
to
his
son
jesus
christ
who
is
the
friend
and
savior
of
all
who
love
him
is
good
said
the
chief
know
the
great
spirit
but
we
know
nothing
of
the
other
gods
of
the
white
men
sleep
now
for
your
strength
and
activity
will
be
tried
and
henrich
lay
down
and
slept
long
and
peacefully
he
was
awakened
the
next
morning
by
the
gentle
voice
of
oriana
who
stood
beside
him
and
said
must
rise
now
and
eat
with
me
before
you
go
out
to
try
your
strength
and
skill
come
to
my
apartment
henrich
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
around
him
in
wonder
but
quickly
the
whole
sad
reality
of
his
situation
came
over
him
and
he
felt
that
he
must
nerve
himself
for
the
coming
trial
soon
he
followed
oriana
to
her
inner
room
where
a
slight
indian
repast
of
maize
and
fruits
had
been
prepared
by
the
young
and
her
attendants
tisquantum
had
left
the
lodge
and
was
now
occupied
in
preparing
a
spot
for
the
exercise
of
the
white
boy
skill
at
his
side
stood
coubitant
silent
and
gloomy
his
indignation
at
the
chief
merciful
intentions
towards
the
intended
victim
was
great
and
strongly
had
he
urged
him
to
the
immediate
slaughter
of
the
captive
but
tisquantum
was
not
to
be
lightly
moved
either
to
good
or
evil
he
had
said
that
the
boy
should
live
if
he
proved
himself
worthy
to
bear
indian
arms
and
all
the
cruel
suggestions
and
arguments
that
coubitant
could
bring
forward
only
made
him
more
resolved
to
keep
his
word
the
young
savage
then
forbore
to
speak
for
he
saw
that
it
was
useless
and
he
feared
to
displease
his
chief
whose
favor
was
the
highest
object
of
his
ambition
since
the
untimely
death
of
his
son
coubitant
had
been
constantly
his
companion
and
attendant
until
he
had
been
left
near
the
english
settlement
to
carry
out
his
schemes
of
revenge
his
success
in
this
enterprise
a
raised
him
still
higher
in
estimation
and
visions
of
becoming
the
of
the
chief
and
eventually
succeeding
him
in
his
office
already
floated
in
the
brain
of
coubitant
in
a
few
years
oriana
hand
would
be
given
to
some
fortunate
warrior
and
who
could
have
so
strong
a
claim
to
it
as
the
man
who
had
risked
his
own
life
to
procure
vengeance
for
her
death
therefore
coubitant
held
his
peace
and
checked
the
expression
of
his
deadly
and
malignant
feelings
towards
the
young
prisoner
soon
henrich
was
summoned
to
the
ground
where
his
fate
was
to
be
decided
and
he
was
directed
to
try
his
powers
with
several
indian
boys
of
his
own
age
in
shooting
with
the
bow
and
arrow
he
could
not
by
any
means
rival
their
skill
and
accuracy
of
aim
but
in
casting
the
spear
and
wielding
the
tomahawk
he
showed
himself
their
equal
and
when
he
was
made
to
wrestle
with
his
swarthy
and
competitors
the
superior
height
and
muscular
powers
of
the
british
lad
enabled
him
to
gain
the
victory
in
almost
every
instance
tisquantum
was
satisfied
he
pronounced
him
worthy
to
live
and
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
coubitant
which
was
once
more
cautiously
manifested
he
presented
henrich
with
the
arms
that
he
knew
so
well
how
to
use
and
informed
him
that
he
should
henceforth
dwell
in
his
lodge
among
his
braves
and
should
no
more
inhabit
the
apartments
of
the
women
to
a
young
and
generous
mind
success
and
approbation
are
always
grateful
and
henrich
eye
kindled
and
his
cheek
burned
as
he
listened
to
the
praises
of
the
chief
and
felt
that
he
owed
his
life
under
providence
to
his
own
efforts
and
when
his
little
friend
oriana
came
bounding
up
to
him
with
joy
and
exultation
in
her
intelligent
countenance
and
playfully
flung
a
wreath
of
flowers
across
his
shoulders
in
token
of
victory
he
felt
that
even
among
these
children
of
the
wilderness
these
dreaded
nausett
indians
he
could
find
something
to
love
in
coubitant
he
instinctively
felt
that
he
had
also
something
to
dread
but
the
savage
tried
to
conceal
his
feeling
and
even
to
please
the
chief
and
oriana
by
pretending
an
interest
in
their
young
favorite
which
for
a
long
time
deceived
them
as
to
his
real
sentiments
the
bustle
of
preparation
for
the
intended
removal
of
the
encampment
began
that
day
for
tisquantum
was
now
more
eager
than
ever
to
get
beyond
the
reach
of
the
settlers
and
before
sunset
all
was
ready
the
next
morning
the
march
commenced
at
daybreak
and
continued
for
many
days
uninterruptedly
until
the
chief
and
his
followers
reached
the
residence
of
his
pequodee
allies
when
he
considered
himself
safe
from
pursuit
even
if
the
settlers
should
attempt
it
he
therefore
halted
his
party
and
took
up
his
abode
among
his
friends
to
wait
until
they
were
prepared
to
set
out
on
their
hunting
expedition
to
the
western
prairies
a
period
of
repose
was
also
very
needful
for
the
women
and
children
for
the
march
had
been
a
most
fatiguing
one
not
only
had
the
sachem
dreaded
the
pursuit
of
the
injured
settlers
and
therefore
hurried
his
party
to
their
utmost
speed
but
the
country
through
which
they
had
traveled
was
inhabited
by
the
narragansett
tribe
the
ancient
and
hereditary
foes
of
the
pequodees
it
was
consequently
desirable
for
the
nausetts
as
allies
of
the
latter
to
spend
as
little
time
as
possible
in
the
territories
of
their
enemies
and
little
rest
ad
been
permitted
to
the
travelers
until
they
had
passed
the
boundary
of
the
friendly
pequodees
chapter
vi
solemn
are
the
boundless
woods
of
the
great
western
world
when
day
declines
and
louder
sounds
the
roll
of
distant
floods
more
deep
the
rustling
of
the
ancient
pines
when
dimness
gathers
on
the
stilly
air
and
mystery
seems
every
leaf
to
brood
awful
is
it
for
human
heart
to
bear
the
might
and
burden
of
the
solitude
hemans
many
weeks
elapsed
after
the
nausett
party
had
joined
the
friendly
pequodees
ere
any
preparations
were
made
for
journeying
to
the
west
and
these
days
were
chiefly
employed
by
henrich
in
improving
his
knowledge
of
the
indian
language
and
especially
of
the
nausett
dialect
by
conversing
with
oriana
and
her
young
companions
both
male
and
female
he
also
endeavored
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
of
the
habit
and
the
ideas
of
the
simple
people
among
whom
his
lot
was
now
cast
for
he
hoped
at
some
future
time
when
he
had
succeeded
in
returning
to
his
own
countrymen
that
such
a
knowledge
might
prove
useful
both
to
himself
and
them
he
was
treated
with
much
kindness
by
tisquantum
and
his
favor
with
the
chief
ensured
the
respect
and
attention
of
all
his
dependants
and
followers
from
the
day
that
the
white
boy
had
been
spared
from
a
cruel
and
violent
death
and
established
as
a
regular
inmate
of
dwelling
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
regarded
him
as
a
son
and
had
adopted
him
to
fill
the
place
of
him
whose
death
he
so
deeply
deplored
and
oriana
already
looked
on
him
as
a
brother
and
took
the
greatest
delight
in
his
society
no
apprehensions
were
now
felt
of
his
escaping
to
the
settlement
for
the
distance
which
they
had
traveled
through
woods
and
over
hills
and
plains
to
reach
the
pequodee
encampment
was
so
great
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
any
one
but
an
indian
well
accustomed
to
the
country
to
traverse
it
alone
henrich
was
therefore
allowed
to
enjoy
perfect
liberty
and
to
ramble
unmolested
around
the
camp
and
it
was
his
greatest
pleasure
to
climb
to
the
summit
of
a
neighboring
hill
which
was
crowned
by
a
few
ancient
and
majestic
pines
and
there
to
look
in
wonder
and
admiration
at
the
scenery
around
him
to
the
west
a
vast
and
trackless
forest
spread
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
unbroken
save
by
some
distant
lakes
that
shone
like
clear
mirrors
in
their
dark
green
setting
trees
of
gigantic
growth
rose
high
above
their
brethren
of
the
wood
but
wild
luxuriant
creepers
many
of
them
bearing
clusters
of
bright
blossoms
had
climbed
ambitiously
to
their
summits
seeking
the
light
of
day
and
the
warmth
of
the
sunbeams
which
could
not
penetrate
the
thick
underwood
that
was
their
it
was
a
sea
of
varied
and
undulating
foliage
beautiful
and
striking
but
almost
oppressive
to
the
spirit
and
henrich
gazed
sadly
over
the
interminable
forest
and
thought
of
the
weeks
and
months
and
possibly
the
years
that
this
wilderness
was
to
be
his
home
escape
under
present
circumstances
he
felt
to
be
impossible
and
he
endeavored
to
reconcile
himself
to
his
fate
and
to
look
forward
with
hope
to
a
dim
and
uncertain
future
could
his
parents
and
edith
but
have
been
assured
of
his
safety
he
thought
he
could
have
borne
his
captivity
more
cheerfully
but
to
feel
that
they
were
mourning
him
as
dead
and
that
perhaps
they
would
never
know
that
his
blood
had
not
been
cruelly
shed
by
his
captors
was
hard
for
the
affectionate
boy
to
endure
to
oriana
alone
could
he
tell
his
feelings
and
pour
out
his
griefs
and
anxieties
and
edith
herself
could
not
have
listened
to
him
with
more
attention
and
sympathy
than
was
shown
by
the
young
indian
girl
when
her
domestic
duties
were
accomplished
she
would
accompany
her
new
friend
to
his
favorite
retreat
on
the
and
there
seated
by
his
side
beneath
the
tall
pines
she
would
hold
his
hand
and
gaze
into
his
sorrowful
countenance
and
listen
to
his
fond
regrets
for
his
distant
home
and
all
its
inmates
till
tears
would
gather
in
her
soft
black
eyes
and
she
almost
wished
that
she
could
restore
him
to
his
countrymen
but
this
she
was
powerless
to
do
even
if
she
could
have
made
up
her
mind
to
the
sacrifice
of
her
brother
as
she
called
him
she
had
indeed
wrought
upon
her
father
so
far
as
to
save
his
life
and
have
him
adopted
into
their
tribe
and
family
but
she
well
knew
that
nothing
would
ever
induce
him
to
give
up
his
possession
of
rodolph
son
or
suffer
his
parents
to
know
that
he
lived
all
this
she
told
to
henrich
and
his
spirit
sanguine
as
it
was
sickened
at
the
prospect
of
a
lengthened
captivity
among
uncivilized
and
heathen
beings
he
gazed
mournfully
to
the
east
he
looked
over
the
wide
expanse
of
country
that
he
had
lately
traversed
and
his
eye
seemed
to
pierce
the
rising
hills
and
lofty
forests
that
lay
between
him
and
his
cherished
home
and
in
the
words
of
the
psalmist
he
cried
that
i
had
wings
as
a
dove
for
then
would
i
flee
away
and
be
at
rest
would
you
leave
me
my
brother
said
oriana
in
reply
to
this
unconscious
utterance
of
his
feelings
you
leave
me
again
alone
to
mourn
the
brother
i
have
lost
the
sachem
loves
you
and
i
love
you
too
and
you
may
be
happy
in
our
lodge
and
become
a
brave
like
our
young
men
oriana
you
and
your
father
are
kind
to
me
and
i
had
never
known
any
other
mode
of
life
i
might
be
happy
in
your
lodge
but
i
can
not
forget
my
parents
and
me
dear
edith
who
loved
me
so
fondly
and
my
little
brother
also
and
then
i
had
a
friend
a
kind
friend
and
full
of
wisdom
and
goodness
who
used
to
teach
me
all
kinds
of
knowledge
and
above
all
the
knowledge
of
the
way
to
heaven
how
can
i
think
that
i
may
perhaps
never
see
all
these
again
and
not
be
sad
and
henrich
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
without
restraint
oriana
gazed
at
him
affectionately
and
tears
of
sympathy
filled
her
large
eyes
also
but
she
drew
away
hand
and
kissed
it
and
tried
to
cheer
him
in
the
best
way
that
her
simple
mind
could
suggest
brother
must
not
weep
she
said
he
is
not
a
child
and
our
indian
youths
are
ashamed
of
tears
henrich
will
be
a
brave
some
day
and
he
will
delight
in
hunting
and
in
war
as
our
red
warriors
do
and
he
will
i
know
excel
them
all
in
strength
and
courage
what
can
he
desire
more
than
to
be
a
nausett
warrior
oriana
replied
the
boy
as
he
wiped
away
his
tears
and
almost
smiled
at
her
attempts
to
console
him
by
such
a
future
prospect
i
desire
to
return
to
my
home
and
my
friends
and
the
worship
of
my
god
among
your
people
none
know
anything
of
the
true
god
and
none
believe
in
his
son
i
have
no
one
to
speak
to
me
as
my
parents
and
my
venerable
teacher
used
to
do
and
no
one
to
kneel
with
me
in
prayer
to
the
almighty
not
you
worship
the
great
mahneto
the
mighty
spirit
from
whom
every
good
gift
comes
asked
oriana
with
surprise
is
the
one
true
god
and
all
the
red
men
know
and
worship
him
oriana
i
do
worship
the
one
great
spirit
the
god
and
father
of
all
men
of
every
color
and
of
every
clime
but
the
christian
god
is
far
more
wise
and
good
and
merciful
than
the
indian
mahneto
and
he
has
told
his
servants
what
he
is
and
how
they
ought
to
serve
him
your
mahneto
speak
to
you
asked
the
indian
girl
i
hear
him
speak
has
spoken
to
our
fathers
long
ages
ago
replied
henrich
we
have
his
words
written
in
a
book
oh
that
i
had
that
blessed
book
with
me
how
it
would
comfort
me
to
read
it
now
you
would
read
it
to
me
my
brother
but
tell
me
some
of
your
mahneto
words
and
tell
me
why
you
say
he
is
greater
and
better
than
the
good
spirit
who
protects
the
red
men
will
gladly
tell
you
all
i
know
of
the
god
whom
i
have
been
taught
to
love
and
worship
ever
since
i
was
a
little
child
i
wish
i
could
make
you
love
him
too
oriana
and
teach
you
to
pray
to
him
and
to
believe
in
his
son
as
your
friend
and
savior
will
believe
all
you
tell
me
dear
henrich
answered
the
ingenuous
girl
i
am
sure
you
would
never
say
the
thing
that
is
not
but
what
do
you
mean
by
a
savior
is
it
some
one
who
will
save
you
from
the
power
of
the
evil
spirit
hobbamock
the
enemy
of
the
red
men
footnote
the
indian
expression
for
speaking
a
falsehood
then
henrich
told
her
of
jesus
the
merciful
him
who
came
to
save
a
world
that
was
lost
and
ruined
through
sin
and
to
die
for
those
who
deserve
nothing
but
wrath
and
condemnation
long
the
youthful
teacher
and
his
attentive
pupil
conversed
and
many
and
strange
were
the
questions
that
oriana
asked
and
that
henrich
was
enabled
by
the
help
of
the
spirit
to
answer
the
dark
searching
eyes
of
the
intelligent
young
indian
were
fixed
on
his
and
her
glossy
black
hair
was
thrown
back
over
her
shoulders
while
she
listened
in
wonder
and
admiration
to
every
word
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
her
white
brother
that
evening
a
new
and
awakening
source
of
interest
was
opened
to
the
young
captive
and
the
dreariness
of
his
life
seemed
almost
to
have
passed
away
the
affection
of
oriana
had
hitherto
been
his
only
solace
and
comfort
and
now
the
hope
of
repaying
that
affection
by
becoming
the
humble
means
of
leading
her
out
of
the
darkness
of
heathenism
and
pointing
out
to
her
the
way
of
eternal
salvation
raised
his
spirits
and
almost
reconciled
him
to
his
present
banishment
from
home
and
all
its
cherished
joys
and
comforts
more
deeply
than
ever
did
he
now
regret
that
he
was
deprived
of
all
access
to
the
word
of
life
from
which
he
might
have
read
and
translated
the
story
of
mercy
to
his
young
disciple
and
have
taught
her
the
gracious
promises
of
god
but
henrich
had
been
well
taught
at
home
his
truly
pious
parents
had
early
stored
his
mind
with
numerous
passages
of
scripture
and
the
effort
he
now
made
to
recall
to
his
memory
all
the
most
interesting
stories
and
most
striking
texts
that
he
had
learnt
from
the
word
of
god
was
the
means
of
fixing
them
indelibly
on
his
own
heart
he
never
in
after
life
forgot
what
he
now
taught
to
oriana
the
instruction
was
as
is
generally
the
case
quite
as
much
blessed
to
the
teacher
as
to
the
learner
and
henrich
was
himself
surprised
to
find
how
readily
he
could
call
to
mind
the
very
passage
he
wanted
and
how
easily
he
could
convey
its
import
to
oriana
in
her
own
melodious
language
frequently
were
these
interesting
conversations
renewed
and
never
without
henrich
perceiving
with
thankfulness
that
oriana
was
making
progress
in
spiritual
knowledge
and
also
in
quickness
of
understanding
and
general
intelligence
for
it
may
truly
be
said
that
no
kind
of
learning
awakens
the
dormant
powers
of
the
intellect
or
quickens
the
growth
of
the
mind
so
effectually
as
the
knowledge
of
the
one
true
god
who
created
the
spirit
and
of
his
son
who
died
to
redeem
it
from
the
ignominious
and
degrading
bondage
of
sin
and
satan
henrich
had
at
first
imagined
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
him
to
find
an
intelligent
companion
among
the
savage
race
into
whose
hands
he
bad
fallen
and
he
had
deeply
felt
that
sense
of
loneliness
which
a
cultivated
mind
however
young
must
experience
in
the
society
of
those
whose
ideas
and
feelings
are
altogether
beneath
its
own
and
who
can
in
no
way
sympathize
with
any
of
its
hopes
and
fears
and
aspirations
but
now
the
english
boy
began
to
perceive
that
the
superiority
of
the
white
men
over
the
dark
aborigines
of
america
might
possibly
arise
much
more
from
difference
of
education
than
from
difference
of
race
and
color
he
remembered
also
how
ardently
he
had
desired
to
share
with
the
pious
brewster
and
winslow
in
their
projected
plans
for
the
conversion
of
the
natives
and
he
hoped
that
young
and
comparatively
ignorant
as
he
knew
himself
to
be
it
might
perhaps
please
god
to
make
him
the
instrument
of
bestowing
spiritual
blessings
on
some
at
least
of
the
heathen
among
whom
he
dwelt
he
therefore
resolved
to
employ
all
powers
of
argument
and
persuasion
to
convince
the
mind
and
touch
the
heart
of
the
young
not
only
for
the
sake
of
her
own
immortal
soul
but
also
in
the
hope
that
her
influence
if
she
became
a
sincere
christian
might
greatly
tend
to
the
conversion
of
her
father
and
his
tribe
since
the
night
when
tisquantum
had
seen
his
young
captive
kneel
in
prayer
and
had
questioned
him
as
to
the
object
of
his
worship
he
had
never
spoken
to
him
on
the
subject
of
his
religion
and
henrich
had
feared
to
address
the
stern
old
chief
or
to
introduce
a
theme
which
though
constantly
present
to
his
own
mind
and
the
source
of
all
his
consolation
would
probably
he
rejected
with
scorn
and
contempt
by
the
sachem
the
more
the
christian
boy
became
acquainted
with
the
character
of
tisquantum
the
stronger
became
this
fear
and
the
more
he
despaired
of
any
influence
proving
sufficiently
strong
to
break
the
chains
of
error
and
superstition
that
bound
him
to
heathenism
the
chief
was
a
distinguished
powow
or
conjuror
and
was
regarded
by
his
own
people
and
even
by
many
other
tribes
as
possessing
great
super
natural
powers
his
pretensions
were
great
and
fully
accredited
by
his
subjects
who
believed
that
he
could
control
the
power
of
the
subordinate
evil
spirits
and
even
exercise
a
certain
influence
on
hobbamock
himself
he
was
called
a
mahneto
or
priest
as
being
the
servant
or
deputy
of
the
great
mahneto
and
permitted
by
him
to
cure
diseases
by
a
word
or
a
charm
to
bring
down
rain
on
the
thirsty
land
and
to
foretell
the
issue
of
events
such
as
the
results
of
wars
or
negotiations
the
influence
which
these
acknowledged
powers
gave
him
over
other
tribes
besides
his
own
was
very
gratifying
to
his
pride
and
ambition
and
could
henrich
hope
that
he
a
young
and
inexperienced
boy
could
have
wisdom
or
eloquence
sufficient
to
down
the
high
thoughts
that
exalted
him
and
to
persuade
him
to
a
disciple
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
no
he
knew
that
such
a
hope
was
humanly
speaking
vain
but
he
knew
also
that
god
all
things
are
possible
and
he
ceased
not
to
pray
that
the
spirit
of
light
and
truth
might
enter
the
soul
of
the
heathen
chief
and
banish
the
spirit
of
evil
that
now
reigned
so
triumphantly
there
henrich
desire
to
see
the
sachem
become
a
christian
was
increased
in
the
same
measure
that
his
hope
of
its
accomplishment
became
less
for
the
more
intimately
he
became
acquainted
with
him
the
more
he
found
in
his
natural
character
that
was
interesting
and
even
estimable
tisquantum
was
brave
and
he
was
also
generous
and
sincere
far
beyond
the
generality
of
his
race
we
have
said
that
the
influence
of
his
wife
whom
he
had
loved
to
an
unusual
degree
for
an
indian
had
tended
to
soften
his
temper
and
disposition
and
his
regret
for
her
loss
and
his
anxiety
that
his
only
daughter
should
resemble
her
had
made
him
more
domestic
in
his
habits
than
most
of
his
brother
chiefs
he
was
kind
also
when
not
roused
to
harshness
and
cruelty
by
either
revenge
or
superstition
and
he
was
capable
of
strong
attachments
where
he
had
once
taken
a
prepossession
in
favor
of
any
individual
such
a
prepossession
he
had
formed
for
his
english
captive
on
the
evening
when
his
child
had
pleaded
for
his
life
and
when
his
own
ingenuous
and
beautiful
countenance
had
joined
so
eloquently
in
her
supplications
no
insidious
efforts
of
the
wily
coubitant
had
availed
to
change
the
sachem
sentiments
and
he
continued
to
treat
henrich
as
an
adopted
son
and
to
allow
him
all
the
privileges
and
indulgences
that
had
once
been
bestowed
on
his
beloved
tekoa
the
white
boy
was
permitted
to
enjoy
full
and
unrestricted
liberty
now
that
he
was
beyond
all
possible
reach
of
his
countrymen
he
was
encouraged
to
hunt
and
sport
and
practice
all
athletic
games
and
exercises
with
the
nausett
and
pequodee
youths
and
he
was
presented
with
such
of
the
arms
and
ornaments
of
the
lost
tekoa
as
were
deemed
suitable
to
his
use
and
his
unusually
tall
and
muscular
figure
often
when
adorned
with
these
strange
and
curious
specimens
of
indian
art
and
ingenuity
did
haunch
smile
to
think
how
edith
and
ludovico
would
wonder
and
admire
if
they
could
see
him
thus
attired
and
then
he
would
sigh
as
he
remembered
that
months
and
years
must
probably
elapse
and
possibly
even
his
life
might
come
to
an
end
ere
he
could
hope
to
see
their
loved
countenances
or
to
excite
their
surprise
and
interest
by
a
relation
of
all
his
perils
and
adventures
to
oriana
alone
could
he
unburden
his
mind
on
such
subjects
and
from
her
he
always
met
with
deep
attention
and
heartfelt
sympathy
but
every
day
she
felt
his
presence
to
be
more
necessary
to
her
happiness
and
her
dread
of
his
escaping
to
his
own
people
to
become
greater
not
only
did
she
shrink
from
the
idea
of
parting
with
her
brother
her
and
delightful
friend
and
companion
but
daily
as
she
grew
in
the
knowledge
of
henrich
religion
and
learnt
to
know
and
love
the
christian
god
and
savior
more
sincerely
did
she
fear
the
possibility
of
losing
her
zealous
young
teacher
and
being
deprived
of
all
intercourse
with
the
only
civilized
and
enlightened
being
whom
she
had
ever
known
she
therefore
rejoiced
when
the
time
arrived
for
leaving
the
pequodee
village
and
pursuing
the
intended
route
to
the
west
for
in
spite
of
the
distance
and
the
many
difficulties
and
obstacles
that
divided
henrich
from
the
british
settlement
she
had
lived
in
continual
fear
and
expectation
of
either
seeing
a
band
of
the
mighty
strangers
come
to
demand
his
restitution
or
revenge
his
supposed
death
or
else
of
his
escaping
from
the
camp
and
braving
every
danger
in
the
attempt
to
return
to
his
happy
christian
home
henrich
often
assured
her
with
sincerity
that
he
had
no
idea
of
venturing
on
so
hopeless
an
attempt
but
whenever
the
indian
girl
saw
his
eyes
fixed
sadly
on
the
eastern
horizon
and
dimmed
as
they
often
were
by
tears
of
sad
remembrance
she
felt
her
fears
again
arise
and
longed
more
earnestly
to
leave
the
spot
and
plunge
into
the
trackless
forest
that
lay
between
the
pequodee
encampment
and
she
proposed
hunting
grounds
the
summer
had
passed
away
and
autumn
was
beginning
to
tinge
the
varied
foliage
of
the
forest
with
all
its
gaudy
hues
of
yellow
and
scarlet
and
purple
when
the
nausetts
and
such
of
their
pequodee
friends
as
desired
to
share
in
their
hunting
expedition
set
forth
from
the
village
many
women
and
girls
accompanied
the
caravan
the
greater
part
on
foot
and
bearing
on
their
shoulders
either
the
younger
children
or
a
large
pack
of
baggage
while
their
husbands
and
fathers
and
brothers
marched
before
them
encumbered
only
with
their
arms
and
hunting
accoutrements
such
was
and
still
is
the
custom
among
the
uncivilized
tribes
of
america
where
women
have
ever
been
regarded
as
being
very
little
more
exulted
than
the
beasts
that
perish
and
have
been
accustomed
to
meet
with
scarcely
more
attention
and
respect
but
there
are
exceptions
to
this
as
to
every
other
rule
and
where
women
have
possessed
unusual
strength
of
mind
or
powers
of
influence
their
condition
has
been
proportionately
better
such
had
been
the
ease
with
tisquantum
wife
and
he
had
ever
treated
her
with
gentleness
and
respect
and
had
never
imposed
on
her
any
of
those
servile
duties
that
commonly
fall
to
the
lot
of
indian
squaws
even
though
they
may
be
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
most
exalted
chiefs
to
his
daughter
the
sachem
was
equally
considerate
and
none
but
the
lightest
toils
of
domestic
indian
life
were
ever
required
from
her
nor
was
any
burden
more
weighty
than
her
own
bow
and
quiver
ever
laid
upon
her
slender
and
graceful
shoulders
when
she
followed
her
father
in
his
frequent
wanderings
on
the
present
occasion
as
the
journey
promised
to
be
unusually
long
and
uninterrupted
tisquantum
obtained
for
her
a
small
and
active
horse
of
the
wild
breed
that
abounds
in
the
western
woods
and
plains
and
of
which
valuable
animals
the
pequodees
possessed
a
moderate
number
which
they
had
procured
by
barter
from
the
neighboring
cree
indians
the
purchase
of
this
steed
gave
henrich
the
first
opportunity
of
remarking
the
indian
mode
of
buying
and
selling
and
the
article
that
formed
their
medium
of
commerce
and
was
employed
as
money
this
consisted
of
square
and
pieces
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
a
peculiar
called
quahock
in
each
of
which
a
hole
was
bored
to
enable
it
to
be
strung
on
a
slender
cord
the
general
name
for
this
native
money
was
wampum
or
white
from
the
color
of
those
shells
most
esteemed
but
a
species
was
called
luki
or
black
and
both
were
used
of
various
forms
and
sizes
as
ornaments
by
the
warriors
and
their
wives
and
children
several
strings
of
wampum
both
white
and
purple
were
silently
offered
by
the
sachem
for
the
horse
which
he
selected
as
most
suitable
for
his
daughter
use
and
after
a
pause
were
as
silently
rejected
by
the
possessor
another
pause
ensued
and
tisquantum
added
a
fresh
string
of
the
precious
shell
to
the
small
heap
that
lay
before
him
and
the
same
scene
was
repeated
until
the
owner
of
the
horse
was
satisfied
when
he
placed
the
halter
in
the
hands
of
the
purchaser
gathered
up
his
treasure
and
with
a
look
of
mournful
affection
at
the
faithful
creature
whom
he
was
resigning
to
the
power
of
another
master
hurried
away
to
his
wigwam
the
next
day
the
march
began
and
proud
and
happy
was
oriana
as
she
closely
followed
her
father
steps
mounted
on
her
new
palfrey
and
led
by
her
adopted
brother
while
by
her
side
bounded
a
favorite
young
dog
of
the
celebrated
breed
now
called
newfoundland
which
had
been
given
to
her
brother
as
a
puppy
just
before
his
melancholy
death
and
had
been
her
only
playfellow
and
loved
companion
until
henrich
had
arrived
to
rival
the
faithful
creature
in
her
affections
at
his
request
the
dog
received
the
name
of
rodolph
in
memory
of
his
father
and
henrich
was
never
tired
of
caressing
him
and
teaching
him
to
fetch
and
carry
and
to
plunge
into
his
favorite
element
and
bring
from
the
foamy
torrent
or
the
placid
lake
any
object
which
he
directed
him
to
seize
he
was
a
noble
fellow
and
returned
the
care
and
kindness
of
his
new
friend
with
all
the
ardor
and
faithfulness
of
his
nature
it
was
his
duty
to
accompany
henrich
in
all
his
expeditions
in
pursuit
of
game
and
to
bring
to
his
feet
every
bird
or
small
animal
that
his
increasing
skill
in
archery
enabled
him
to
pierce
with
his
light
and
arrows
during
his
residence
in
the
pequodee
village
he
had
generally
gone
on
such
expeditions
in
company
with
several
other
men
and
boys
and
oriana
had
consequently
enjoyed
little
opportunity
of
perceiving
how
much
he
had
improved
in
dexterity
since
he
had
made
his
first
trial
before
his
captors
but
now
as
they
traversed
the
woods
together
he
frequently
aimed
at
her
desire
at
some
brilliant
bird
or
bounding
squirrel
and
the
young
maiden
exulted
at
his
success
and
at
the
sagacity
and
obedience
of
rodolph
in
bringing
her
the
game
the
constant
occupation
and
the
change
of
scene
that
henrich
enjoyed
during
this
journey
tended
greatly
to
raise
his
spirits
and
even
to
reconcile
him
to
his
new
mode
of
life
he
did
not
forget
his
friends
and
his
home
he
did
not
even
cease
to
think
of
them
with
the
same
regret
and
affection
but
it
was
with
softened
feelings
and
with
a
settled
hope
of
eventually
returning
to
them
after
a
certain
period
of
wandering
and
adventure
the
kind
of
life
which
he
had
often
longed
to
try
was
now
his
lot
and
he
enjoyed
it
under
peculiarly
favorable
circumstances
for
he
partook
of
its
wildness
and
excitement
without
enduring
any
of
its
hardships
no
wonder
then
that
a
and
youth
of
henrich
age
should
often
forget
that
his
wanderings
were
compulsory
and
should
feel
cheerful
and
even
exhilarated
as
he
roamed
through
the
boundless
primeval
forests
or
crossed
the
summits
of
the
ranges
of
lofty
hills
that
occasionally
lifted
their
barren
crags
above
the
otherwise
unbroken
sea
of
foliage
pitching
the
camp
for
the
night
was
always
a
season
of
excitement
and
pleasure
to
the
young
traveler
and
his
lively
companion
oriana
the
selection
of
an
open
glade
and
the
procuring
wood
and
water
and
erecting
temporary
huts
were
all
delightful
from
their
novelty
and
then
when
all
was
done
and
fires
were
kindled
and
the
frugal
evening
meal
was
finished
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
with
oriana
beneath
the
lofty
trees
whose
smooth
straight
trunks
rose
like
stately
columns
and
to
watch
the
glancing
beams
of
the
setting
sun
as
they
shone
on
the
varied
foliage
now
tinted
with
all
the
hues
of
autumn
and
listen
to
the
sighing
of
the
evening
breeze
that
made
solemn
music
while
it
swept
through
the
forest
these
were
happy
and
tranquil
hours
for
then
henrich
would
resume
the
interesting
topics
to
which
his
dusky
pupil
was
never
weary
of
listening
he
would
tell
her
but
no
longer
with
tears
of
his
home
and
all
its
occupations
and
joys
he
would
repeat
the
holy
instructions
that
he
had
himself
received
and
when
far
removed
from
the
observation
of
other
eyes
and
ears
he
would
teach
her
to
kneel
by
his
side
as
edith
used
to
do
and
to
join
him
in
supplications
to
high
and
lofty
one
that
inhabiteth
eternity
but
who
yet
listens
to
the
humblest
prayers
that
are
addressed
to
him
in
sincerity
and
hears
every
petition
that
is
offered
up
in
the
name
of
his
beloved
son
the
heart
of
oriana
was
touched
and
with
a
beautiful
simplicity
she
received
all
the
blessed
truths
that
her
brother
taught
her
her
affections
were
strongly
drawn
towards
the
character
of
jesus
the
merciful
as
she
always
called
the
savior
and
she
became
sensitively
alive
to
the
guilt
of
every
sin
as
showing
ingratitude
to
the
benefactor
who
had
laid
down
his
life
for
his
creatures
oriana
was
in
fact
a
christian
a
young
and
a
weak
one
it
is
true
but
she
possessed
that
faith
which
alone
can
constitute
any
one
branch
in
the
true
and
henrich
now
felt
that
lie
had
found
a
sister
indeed
as
the
young
indian
grew
in
grace
she
grew
also
in
sweetness
of
manner
and
refinement
of
taste
and
behavior
she
was
no
longer
a
savage
either
in
mind
or
in
conduct
and
henrich
often
looked
at
her
in
wonder
and
admiration
when
she
had
made
her
simple
toilette
by
the
side
of
a
clear
stream
and
had
decked
her
glossy
raven
hair
with
one
of
the
magnificent
water
lilies
that
be
had
gathered
for
her
on
its
brink
and
he
wished
that
his
mother
and
his
fair
young
sister
could
behold
his
little
indian
beauty
for
he
knew
that
they
would
love
her
and
would
forget
that
she
had
a
dusky
skin
and
was
born
of
a
savage
and
heathen
race

the

cry

henrich
as
one
evening
during

he
and

had
strayed
a
little
from

party
who
were
seeking

that

we
need

to

them
as
she
spoke
the
young
stranger
rapidly
approached
them
with
an
expression
of
hope
and
expectation
on
his
animated
countenance
but
this
changed
as
quickly
to
a
look
of
deep
despondence
and
grief
when
he
had
advanced
within
a
few
paces
and
fixed
his
searching
eyes
en
henrich
face
he
murmured
in
a
low
and
mournful
voice
and
clasping
his
hands
in
bitterness
of
disappointment
it
is

it
is
not
my

i
have
sat
by

grave

supplied
him
with

thy

away

take

verdant
and
flowering
screen
around
them
the
invitation
was
gratefully
accepted
for
the
countenances
of
the
crees
inspired
confidence
and
oriana
knew
that
her
father
intended
to
visit
a
settlement
of
these
friendly
people
in
the
district
they
were
now
traversing
she
also
felt
her
curiosity
strongly
excited
by
what
had
just
occurred
and
she
longed
for
an
explanation
of
the
conduct
of
the
interesting
young
savage
who
had
first
accosted
them
she
therefore
requested
one
of
their
new
acquaintances
to
go
in
search
of
the
main
body
of
their
party
and
to
inform
the
sachem
that
she
and
henrich
had
preceded
them
to
the
wigwams
and
then
with
a
dignity
and
composure
that
were
astonishing
in
one
so
young
and
accustomed
to
so
wild
a
life
she
guided
her
palfrey
into
the
narrow
path
that
wound
through
the
undergrowth
of
evergreens
while
henrich
walked
by
her
side
and
rodolph
bounded
before
her
they
came
to
the
spot
where
the
young
indian
sat
by
a
grave
and
tears
were
falling
from
his
eyes
as
he
gazed
at
the
mound
around
which
wore
arranged
several
and
ornamented
weapons
and
articles
of
attire
and
also
a
small
quantity
of
firewood
and
food
and
tobacco
intended
for
the
use
of
the
departed
on
his
long
journey
to
the
land
of
spirits
this
is
a
custom
of
most
of
the
north
american
tribes
but
the
crees
have
several
superstitions
peculiar
to
themselves
especially
that
melancholy
one
to
which
we
have
just
alluded
and
which
subjects
them
to
such
lengthened
sorrow
and
disappointment
for
they
watch
and
look
for
the
return
of
their
lost
and
lamented
friends
who
can
never
come
again
to
gladden
their
eyes
on
earth
o
that
they
were
taught
to
place
their
hopes
of
a
blessed
reunion
with
those
they
love
on
the
only
sure
foundation
for
such
hopes
even
on
him
who
is
resurrection
and
the
life
then
they
need
never
be
disappointed
it
was
this
strange
expectation
of
the
reappearance
in
human
form
of
the
lately
dead
that
occasioned
the
incident
we
have
just
related
an
epidemic
disease
had
been
prevalent
in
the
cree
village
and
among
those
who
had
fallen
victims
to
it
uncas
the
eldest
orphan
son
of
the
principal
man
of
the
village
was
the
most
deeply
regretted
and
his
return
was
the
most
anxiously
desired
especially
was
this
vain
hope
cherished
by
his
younger
brother
jyanough
to
whom
he
had
been
an
object
of
the
fondest
love
and
most
unbounded
admiration
and
who
daily
as
the
evening
closed
took
fresh
food
and
water
to
the
grave
and
sat
there
till
night
closed
in
calling
on
uncas
and
listening
for
his
coming
footsteps
then
he
retired
sadly
to
his
wigwam
to
lament
his
brother
continued
absence
and
to
hope
for
better
success
the
following
evening
during
each
night
the
dogs
of
the
village
or
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
devoured
the
food
designed
for
uncas
but
jyanough
believed
it
had
been
used
by
his
brother
spirit
and
continued
still
to
renew
the
store
and
to
hope
that
at
length
the
departed
would
show
himself
and
would
return
to
dwell
in
his
wigwam
when
haunch
approached
the
grave
leading
oriana
pony
the
mourner
looked
up
and
gazed
in
his
face
again
with
that
sad
and
inquiring
look
but
now
it
did
not
change
to
disappointment
for
he
knew
that
the
stranger
was
not
uncas
there
was
even
pleasure
in
his
countenance
as
the
clear
glance
of
the
english
boy
deep
blue
eye
met
his
own
and
he
rose
from
his
seat
at
the
head
of
the
grave
and
going
up
to
henrich
gently
took
his
hand
and
said
the
white
stranger
be
jyanough
brother
his
step
is
free
and
his
eyes
are
bright
and
his
glance
goes
deep
into
jyanough
heart
will
the
be
the
friend
of
him
who
has
now
no
friend
for
four
moons
are
guile
and
uncas
does
not
answer
to
my
call
henrich
and
jyanough
were
strangers
they
were
altogether
different
in
race
in
education
and
in
their
mode
of
thinking
and
feeling
yet
there
was
one
ground
of
sympathy
between
them
of
which
the
young
indian
seemed
instinctively
conscious
both
had
recently
known
deep
sorrow
and
both
had
felt
that
sickening
sense
of
loneliness
that
falls
on
the
young
heart
when
suddenly
divided
from
all
it
most
dearly
loves
by
death
or
other
circumstances
jyanough
and
his
elder
brother
uncas
had
been
deprived
of
both
their
parents
not
many
months
before
the
fatal
disease
broke
out
which
had
carried
off
so
many
victims
amongst
the
crees
the
orphan
youths
had
then
become
to
each
other
and
their
mutual
attachment
had
excited
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
whole
village
of
which
at
his
father
death
uncas
became
the
leading
man
had
he
lived
his
brother
would
have
assisted
him
in
the
government
and
direction
of
that
portion
of
the
tribe
but
when
he
fell
before
the
desolating
pestilence
jyanough
was
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
be
made
sachem
and
the
title
was
conferred
on
a
warrior
who
was
deemed
more
capable
of
supporting
the
dignity
of
the
community
thenceforth
the
youth
was
alone
in
his
wigwam
he
had
no
sister
to
under
take
its
domestic
duties
and
no
friend
with
whom
it
pleased
him
to
dwell
he
saw
something
in
henrich
countenance
that
promised
sympathy
and
he
frankly
demanded
his
friendship
and
the
english
boy
did
not
refuse
to
bestow
it
on
the
young
indian
he
spoke
to
him
in
his
own
tongue
and
jyanough
black
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
as
he
heard
words
of
kindness
from
the
lips
of
the
stranger
henrich
height
and
manly
figure
made
him
appear
much
older
than
he
really
was
and
as
he
and
his
new
friend
walked
together
towards
the
village
he
seemed
to
be
jyanough
equal
in
age
and
strength
although
the
young
savage
was
several
years
his
senior
as
they
entered
the
glade
that
was
surrounded
by
lofty
trees
and
studded
with
wigwams
tisquantum
and
the
rest
of
the
party
approached
by
a
path
on
the
other
side
and
they
all
met
in
the
center
of
the
open
space
and
were
welcomed
by
the
friendly
crees
wigwams
were
appointed
to
the
sachem
and
his
daughter
and
the
most
distinguished
of
the
nausetts
and
their
pequodee
allies
while
the
inferior
indians
of
both
tribes
were
directed
to
form
huts
for
themselves
beneath
the
neigh
boring
trees
and
all
were
invited
to
partake
freely
of
the
hospitality
of
their
hosts
and
to
rest
at
the
cree
settlement
for
several
days
before
they
resumed
their
journey
jyanough
conducted
his
english
friend
to
his
own
wigwam
which
was
neatly
furnished
and
adorned
with
native
tools
and
weapons
he
bade
him
repose
his
tired
limbs
on
uncas
deserted
couch
and
while
henrich
lay
on
the
bed
of
soft
grass
covered
with
deer
skins
that
occupied
one
corner
of
the
hut
the
indian
youth
busied
himself
in
preparing
an
evening
repast
for
his
guest
the
chief
article
of
this
simple
supper
consisted
of
a
kind
of
meal
made
of
parched
maize
or
indian
corn
which
jyanough
mixed
with
water
in
a
calabash
bowl
and
having
well
kneaded
it
made
it
into
small
cakes
and
baked
them
on
the
embers
of
his
the
nokake
in
its
raw
state
constitutes
the
only
food
of
many
indian
tribes
when
on
a
journey
they
carry
it
in
a
bag
or
a
hollow
leathern
girdle
and
when
they
reach
a
brook
or
pond
they
take
a
spoonful
of
the
dry
meal
and
then
one
of
water
to
prevent
its
choking
them
three
or
four
spoonfuls
are
sufficient
for
a
meal
for
these
hardy
and
abstemious
people
and
with
a
few
dried
shellfish
or
a
morsel
of
deer
flesh
they
will
subsist
on
it
for
months
such
viands
with
the
addition
of
some
wild
fruits
from
the
forest
were
all
that
jyanough
had
to
offer
to
his
guest
but
henrich
had
known
privation
at
home
and
he
had
become
accustomed
to
indian
fare
the
kindness
also
and
the
courtesy
of
the
untutored
savage
as
he
warmly
expressed
his
pleasure
at
receiving
him
into
has
wigwam
were
so
engaging
that
the
young
traveler
would
cheerfully
have
put
up
with
worse
accommodation
from
jyanough
he
now
heard
the
story
of
his
sorrows
which
deeply
interested
him
and
in
return
he
told
his
host
all
that
he
could
remember
of
his
own
past
life
from
his
residence
in
holland
and
his
removal
to
america
even
till
the
moment
when
he
and
oriana
had
approached
the
cree
village
that
evening
the
red
man
listened
with
profound
attention
and
constantly
interrupted
the
narrator
with
intelligent
questions
on
every
subject
that
was
interesting
to
him
but
especially
was
his
curiosity
awakened
when
henrich
in
speaking
of
his
grief
at
being
torn
from
all
his
friends
and
relations
and
his
horror
when
he
had
anticipated
a
sudden
and
violent
death
alluded
to
his
trust
in
god
as
the
only
thing
that
had
then
supported
him
under
his
trials
and
sufferings
and
still
enabled
him
to
hope
for
the
future
the
young
christian
was
not
slow
in
answering
all
his
inquiries
as
to
the
nature
of
the
white
man
mahneto
and
explaining
to
him
why
the
true
believer
can
endure
even
with
cheerfulness
afflictions
and
bereavements
that
are
most
trying
to
flesh
and
blood
in
the
confident
hope
that
god
will
every
event
to
his
people
good
and
will
eventually
restore
all
that
they
have
lost
if
i
worship
your
eagerly
asked
jyanough
will
he
give
back
to
me
my
brother
uncas
i
have
called
on
my
mahneto
for
four
long
moons
in
vain
i
have
offered
him
the
best
of
my
weapons
and
the
chief
of
my
prey
in
hunting
and
i
have
promised
to
pour
on
uncas
grave
the
blood
of
the
first
prisoner
i
capture
in
war
or
the
first
of
our
enemies
that
i
can
take
by
subtlety
still
mahneto
does
not
hear
me
tell
me
then
would
your

footnote
or
great
master
of

the
name
given
by
the
crees
to
their
notion
of
the
supreme
being
is
the
great
spirit
of
evil
henrich
was
much
moved
at
the
impassioned
eagerness
of
the
indian
whose
naturally
mild
and
pensive
expression
was
now
changed
for
one
of
bitter
disappointment
and
even
of
ferocity
and
then
again
animated
with
a
look
of
anxious
hope
and
inquiry
jyanough
he
replied
with
earnest
solemnity
god
will
hear
you
but
he
will
not
give
you
back
your
brother
in
this
world
if
you
learn
to
believe
in
him
and
to
serve
him
and
to
pray
to
him
in
sincerity
he
will
guide
you
to
that
blessed
land
where
after
death
all
his
people
meet
together
and
where
there
is
neither
sorrow
nor
separation
is
uncas
there
cried
the
young
savage
my
brother
there
for
i
will
serve
no
mahneto
who
will
not
restore
me
to
him
our
young
theologian
was
disconcerted
for
a
moment
at
this
puzzling
question
which
has
excited
doubts
and
difficulties
in
wiser
heads
than
his
end
to
which
scripture
gives
no
direct
reply
he
paused
awhile
and
then
he
remembered
that
passage
in
the
second
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
where
the
apostle
is
speaking
of
the
requirements
of
the
law
and
goes
on
to
say
the
gentiles
which
have
not
the
law
do
by
nature
the
things
contained
in
the
law
these
having
not
the
law
are
a
law
unto
themselves
which
show
the
work
of
the
law
written
in
their
hearts
their
conscience
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
the
mean
while
accusing
or
else
excusing
one
another
paul
could
say
this
of
the
severe
and
uncompromising
law
surely
thought
henrich
gospel
of
love
and
mercy
must
hold
out
equal
hope
for
those
heathen
who
perish
in
involuntary
ignorance
but
who
have
acted
up
to
that
law
of
conscience
which
was
their
only
guide
he
also
recollected
that
jesus
himself
when
on
earth
declared
that
that
not
and
did
commit
things
worthy
of
stripes
shall
be
beaten
with
few
stripes
and
therefore
he
felt
justified
in
permitting
the
young
indian
to
hope
that
hereafter
he
might
again
behold
that
brother
whose
virtues
and
whose
affection
were
the
object
of
his
pride
and
his
regret
believe
he
replied
your
brother
who
you
say
was
always
kind
and
just
and
upright
while
he
lived
on
earth
is
now
through
the
mercy
of
god
in
a
state
of
happiness
and
i
believe
that
if
you
also
act
up
to
what
you
know
to
be
right
you
will
join
him
there
and
dwell
with
him
for
ever
but
i
can
tell
you
how
to
attain
a
more
perfect
happiness
and
to
share
the
highest
joys
of
heaven
in
the
kingdom
that
god
has
prepared
for
his
own
son
i
can
tell
you
what
he
has
declared
to
be
his
will
with
regard
to
all
his
human
creatures
even
that
they
should
love
that
son
and
look
to
him
as
their
savior
and
their
king
o
jyanough
ask
oriana
if
she
is
not
happier
since
she
learnt
to
love
and
worship
the
god
of
the
christians
the
only
god
who
can
be
just
and
yet
most
merciful
in
the
vehemence
of
his
feelings
henrich
bad
rather
outstripped
his
companion
powers
of
following
and
comprehending
him
he
saw
this
in
jyanough
wandering
and
incredulous
eyes
and
he
carefully
and
patiently
proceeded
to
explain
to
him
the
first
rudiments
of
religion
as
he
had
done
to
oriana
and
to
reply
to
all
his
doubts
and
questions
according
to
the
ability
that
god
gave
him
a
willing
learner
is
generally
a
quick
one
and
henrich
was
well
pleased
with
his
second
pupil
if
he
was
not
ready
to
relinquish
his
old
ideas
and
superstitions
he
was
at
least
well
inclined
to
listen
to
the
doctrines
of
his
new
friend
and
even
to
receive
them
in
connection
with
many
of
his
heathen
opinions
time
and
the
grace
of
god
henrich
knew
could
only
cause
these
to
give
place
to
a
purer
belief
and
entirely
banish
the
that
dwelt
in
the
of
the
young
indian
mind
but
the
fallow
ground
had
already
been
in
a
manner
broken
up
and
some
good
seed
scattered
on
the
surface
and
henrich
lay
down
to
rest
with
a
fervent
prayer
that
the
dew
of
the
spirit
might
fall
upon
it
and
cause
it
to
grow
and
to
bring
forth
fruit
from
the
time
of
henrich
captivity
he
bad
endeavored
to
keep
up
in
his
own
mind
a
remembrance
of
the
sabbath
or
the
lord
day
as
it
was
always
called
by
the
puritans
and
as
far
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
so
he
observed
it
as
a
day
of
rest
from
common
occupations
and
amusements
on
that
day
he
invariably
declined
joining
any
hunting
or
fishing
parties
and
he
also
selected
it
as
the
time
for
his
longest
spiritual
conversations
with
oriana
as
he
desired
that
she
also
should
learn
to
attach
a
peculiar
feeling
of
reverence
to
a
day
that
must
be
sacred
to
every
christian
but
which
was
always
observed
with
remarkable
strictness
by
the
sect
to
which
henrich
belonged
in
this
as
in
all
other
customs
that
the
young
wished
to
follow
he
was
unopposed
by
tisquantum
who
seemed
entirely
indifferent
as
to
the
religious
feelings
or
social
habits
of
his
adopted
son
so
long
as
he
acquired
a
skill
in
the
arts
of
war
and
hunting
and
in
these
respects
henrich
progress
fully
answered
his
expectations
he
was
like
most
youths
of
his
age
extremely
fond
of
every
kind
of
sport
and
his
strength
and
activity
which
had
greatly
increased
since
he
had
adopted
the
wild
life
of
the
indians
rendered
every
active
exercise
easy
and
delightful
to
him
he
consequently
grew
rapidly
in
the
sachem
favor
and
in
that
of
all
his
companions
who
learnt
to
love
his
kind
and
courteous
manners
as
much
as
they
admired
his
courage
and
address
one
only
of
the
red
men
envied
him
the
esteem
that
he
gained
and
hated
him
for
it
this
was
coubitant
the
aspirant
for
the
chief
place
in
tisquantum
favor
and
for
the
honor
of
one
day
becoming
his
from
the
moment
that
the
captor
life
had
been
spared
by
the
sachem
and
he
had
been
disappointed
of
his
expected
vengeance
for
the
death
of
his
friend
tekoa
the
savage
had
harbored
in
his
breast
a
feeling
of
hatred
towards
the
son
of
the
slayer
and
had
burned
with
a
malicious
desire
for
henrich
s
destruction
this
feeling
he
was
compelled
as
we
have
observed
to
conceal
from
tisquantum
but
it
only
gained
strength
by
the
restraint
imposed
on
its
outward
expression
and
many
were
the
schemes
that
he
devised
for
its
gratification
at
present
however
he
found
it
impossible
to
execute
any
of
them
and
the
object
of
his
hate
and
jealousy
was
happily
unconscious
that
he
had
so
deadly
an
enemy
continually
near
him
an
instinctive
feeling
had
indeed
caused
henrich
to
shun
the
fierce
young
indian
and
to
be
less
at
ease
in
his
company
than
in
that
of
the
other
red
warriors
but
his
own
generous
and
forgiving
nature
forbade
his
suspecting
the
real
sentiments
entertained
towards
him
by
coubitant
or
even
supposing
that
his
expressions
of
approval
and
encouragement
were
all
feigned
to
suit
his
own
evil
purposes
oriana
had
never
liked
him
and
time
only
strengthened
the
prejudice
she
felt
against
him
she
knew
that
he
hoped
eventually
to
make
her
his
wife
or
rather
his
slave
for
coubitant
was
not
a
man
to
relax
from
any
of
the
domestic
tyranny
of
his
race
and
the
more
she
saw
of
her
brother
and
the
more
she
heard
from
him
of
the
habits
and
manners
of
his
countrymen
and
of
their
treatment
of
their
women
the
more
she
felt
the
usual
life
of
an
indian
squaw
to
be
intolerable
even
the
companionship
of
the
young
females
of
her
own
race
became
distasteful
to
her
for
their
ignorance
and
utter
want
of
civilization
struck
painfully
on
her
now
partially
cultivated
and
awakened
mind
and
made
her
feel
ashamed
of
the
coarseness
of
taste
and
manners
occasionally
displayed
by
her
former
friends
and
associates
in
the
christian
captive
alone
had
she
found
since
her
mother
death
a
companion
who
could
sympathize
in
her
tastes
and
feelings
which
had
ever
been
above
the
standard
of
any
others
with
whom
she
was
acquainted
and
henrich
could
do
more
than
sympathize
in
her
aspirations
he
could
instruct
her
how
they
might
be
fully
realized
in
the
attainment
of
divine
knowledge
and
the
experience
of
christian
love
no
wonder
then
that
henrich
held
already
the
first
place
in
her
heart
and
imagination
and
was
endowed
by
her
lively
fancy
with
every
quality
and
every
perfection
both
of
mind
and
body
that
she
could
conceive
to
herself
the
girl
made
no
concealment
of
her
preference
for
the
young
stranger
whom
she
regarded
as
a
brother
but
a
brother
in
every
way
immeasurably
her
superior
and
her
father
never
checked
her
growing
attachment
the
youth
of
both
parties
the
position
that
henrich
occupied
in
his
family
as
his
adopted
son
and
the
difference
of
race
and
color
prevented
him
from
even
anticipating
that
a
warmer
sentiment
than
fraternal
affection
could
arise
between
them
and
he
fully
regarded
his
daughter
as
the
future
inmate
and
mistress
of
an
indian
warrior
lodge
whether
that
of
coubitant
or
of
some
other
brave
would
he
considered
entirely
depend
on
the
comparative
prowess
in
war
and
hunting
and
the
value
of
the
presents
that
would
be
the
offering
of
those
who
claimed
her
hand
that
she
should
exercise
any
choice
in
the
matter
never
occurred
to
him
and
probably
had
he
foreseen
that
such
would
be
the
case
and
that
the
choice
would
fill
on
the
son
of
a
stranger
on
the
captive
whose
father
had
slain
her
only
brother
he
would
have
removed
her
from
such
dangerous
influence
but
he
thought
not
of
such
consequences
resulting
from
the
intimacy
of
henrich
and
oriana
he
only
saw
that
his
child
was
happy
and
that
she
daily
improved
in
grace
and
intelligence
and
in
the
skilful
and
punctual
performance
of
all
her
domestic
duties
and
he
was
well
satisfied
that
he
had
not
shed
the
blood
of
the
christian
youth
on
the
grave
of
his
lost
tekoa
his
own
esteem
and
affection
for
his
adopted
son
also
continued
to
increase
and
young
as
henrich
was
the
influence
of
his
superior
cultivation
of
mind
and
rectitude
of
principle
was
felt
even
by
the
aged
chief
and
caused
him
to
treat
him
at
times
with
a
degree
of
respect
that
added
bitterness
to
coubitant
malicious
feelings
he
saw
how
fondly
oriana
regarded
her
adopted
brother
and
personal
jealousy
made
him
more
as
to
the
possibility
of
her
affection
ripening
into
love
than
her
father
had
as
yet
become
and
gladly
would
the
rival
of
the
unsuspecting
henrich
have
blackened
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
chieftain
and
caused
him
to
be
banished
from
the
lodge
had
he
been
able
to
find
any
accusation
against
him
but
in
this
he
invariably
failed
for
the
was
brave
honest
and
truthful
to
a
degree
that
baffled
the
ingenuity
of
his
wily
foe
and
coubitant
found
that
instead
of
lowering
henrich
in
the
regard
of
the
sachem
he
only
excited
him
to
take
his
part
still
more
and
also
ran
a
great
risk
of
losing
all
the
favor
which
he
had
himself
attained
in
tisquantum
eyes
the
sudden
friendship
that
the
young
jyanough
had
conceived
for
the
white
stranger
and
the
consequent
favor
with
which
he
was
looked
upon
by
oriana
tended
still
more
to
irritate
the
malignant
savage
and
when
a
few
days
after
the
arrival
of
tisquantum
party
at
the
cree
village
he
saw
the
three
young
friends
seated
amicably
together
beneath
a
shadowing
tree
and
evidently
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
he
could
not
resist
stealing
silently
behind
them
and
lurking
in
the
underwood
that
formed
a
thick
background
to
their
position
in
order
to
listen
to
the
subject
of
their
discourse
how
astonished
and
how
indignant
was
he
to
find
that
henrich
was
reasoning
eloquently
against
the
cruel
and
ridiculous
superstitions
of
the
indian
tribes
and
pointing
out
to
his
attentive
hearers
the
infinite
superiority
of
the
christian
belief
and
the
christian
practice
the
acquiescence
that
oriana
expressed
to
the
simple
but
forcible
arguments
of
the
added
to
his
exasperation
and
he
was
also
angry
as
well
as
astonished
to
perceive
that
the
young
cree
although
he
was
yet
unconvinced
was
still
a
willing
listener
and
an
anxious
inquirer
as
to
the
creed
of
his
white
friend
maddened
with
rage
and
excited
also
by
the
hope
of
at
length
arousing
the
anger
of
the
sachem
against
the
christian
youth
he
forgot
his
former
caution
and
hurried
away
with
quick
and
noiseless
step
to
the
wigwam
occupied
by
tisquantum
and
broke
unceremoniously
upon
his
repose
as
he
sat
in
a
state
on
the
soft
mat
that
covered
the
floor
and
smoke
from
his
long
clay
pipe
with
vehement
gestures
coubitant
explained
to
the
sachem
the
cause
of
his
sudden
interruption
and
implored
him
to
listen
to
the
counsel
of
his
most
faithful
friend
and
subject
and
to
lose
no
time
in
banishing
from
his
favor
and
presence
one
who
showed
himself
unworthy
of
all
the
benefits
he
had
heaped
upon
him
and
who
employed
the
life
that
had
been
so
unduly
spared
in
perverting
the
mind
of
his
benefactor
only
child
in
vain
his
eloquence
in
vain
his
wrath
tisquantum
regarded
him
calmly
until
he
had
exhausted
his
torrent
of
passionate
expostulations
and
then
quietly
removing
the
pipe
from
his
lips
he
replied
with
his
and
decision
brother
is
angry
his
zeal
for
the
honor
of
mahneto
has
made
him
forget
his
respect
for
the
sachem
and
the
sachem
adopted
son
the
life
of
the
white
stranger
was
spared
that
he
might
bring
joy
to
the
mournful
eyes
of
oriana
he
has
done
so
my
daughter
smiles
again
and
it
is
well
coubitant
may
he
then
resumed
his
pipe
and
closing
his
eyes
again
gave
himself
up
to
the
drowsy
contemplations
which
the
entrance
of
coubitant
had
interrupted
and
the
disappointed
warrior
retired
with
a
scowl
on
his
dark
brow
and
aggravated
malice
in
his
still
darker
heart

the
indifference
of
tisquantum
on
the
subject
of
the
religious
opinions
that
his
daughter
might
imbibe
from
her
christian
companion
may
seem
strange
but
the
sachem
though
a
heathen
was
in
fact
no
fanatic
he
believed
or
professed
to
believe
that
he
was
himself
in
the
possession
of
supernatural
powers
and
so
long
as
these
pretensions
were
acknowledged
and
he
continued
to
enjoy
the
confidence
and
veneration
of
his
ignorant
countrymen
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
henrich
had
also
on
their
first
acquaintance
distinctly
professed
his
faith
in
the
existence
and
the
power
of
the
great
mahneto
or
of
life
and
this
was
all
the
properly
so
called
of
which
tisquantum
had
any
idea
he
did
not
therefore
give
himself
any
concern
as
to
the
other
objects
of
his
adopted

belief
or
worship

did
he
care
to
prevent

from
listening
to
the
doctrines
of
the
so
long
as
she
continued
obedient
and
gentle
and
neglected
none
of
the
duties
of
an
indian
squaw
the
feelings
of
coubitant
were
different
not
only
did
he
burn
with
an
eager
desire
to
deprive
his
rival
of
the
sachem
love
and
esteem
but
he
also
entertained
a
strong
abhorrence
of
the
religion
of
the
white
men
as
he
had
seen
it
practiced
and
knew
it
was
disseminated
by
the
spanish
settlers
in
mexico
whither
he
had
traveled
in
his
early
youth
in
his
eyes
these
christians
were
base
idolaters
for
such
was
the
impression
made
on
him
by
the
images
and
crucifixes
that
he
beheld
and
the
marks
of
veneration
that
were
paid
to
these
idols
of
wood
and
stone
by
the
superstitious
and
degenerate
spaniards
of
that
district
when
therefore
he
heard
henrich
endeavoring
to
inculcate
the
worship
of
jesus
as
the
son
of
god
on
oriana
and
jyanough
he
not
unnaturally
regarded
him
as
a
believer
in
all
the
deities
whose
images
he
had
seen
associated
with
that
of
jesus
and
receiving
equal
homage
such
unhappily
has
too
often
been
the
impression
made
on
the
minds
of
the
heathen
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
by
the
vain
and
superstitious
observances
of
the
roman
church
when
her
ministers
have
proposed
to
their
acceptance
so
corrupt
a
form
of
christianity
instead
of
the
pure
and
holy
doctrines
of
unadulterated
scripture
to
those
nations
already
given
over
to
idolatry
it
has
appeared
that
their
civilized
teachers
were
only
offering
them
another
kind
of
worship
but
to
the
indians
of
north
america
who
make
use
of
no
images
of
their
deity
and
generally
acknowledge
but
one
great
spirit
of
universal
power
and
beneficence
and
one
spirit
of
evil
the
carved
and
painted
figures
of
the
spanish
invaders
naturally
gave
the
idea
of
a
multitude
of
gods
and
in
some
of
them
excited
unbounded
indignation
and
hatred
this
was
the
case
with
coubitant
who
though
totally
uninfluenced
by
any
love
or
fear
of
the
great
mahneto
whom
he
professed
to
worship
was
yet
like
many
other
bigots
of
various
countries
and
creeds
keenly
jealous
of
any
innovations
in
the
religion
of
his
nation
and
ready
to
oppose
and
even
to
exterminate
all
who
attempted
to
subvert
it
he
now
regarded
henrich
as
such
an
aggressor
on
the
national
faith
and
practice
and
he
consequently
hated
him
with
a
redoubled
hatred
and
ceased
not
to
plot
in
secret
his
ultimate
destruction
meanwhile
his
intended
victim
was
passing
his
time
in
considerable
enjoyment
and
with
a
sense
of
perfect
security
among
the
crees
this
tribe
was
at
that
time
remarkable
for
hospitality
and
likewise
for
courage
and
integrity
these
good
qualities
have
sadly
degenerated
since
their
intercourse
with
europeans
has
enabled
them
to
gratify
the
passion
of
all
savages
for
intoxicating
liquors
but
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
speaking
they
were
a
singularly
fine
race
of
indians
and
their
renown
as
warriors
enabled
them
to
extend
protection
to
such
of
the
neighboring
tribes
as
entered
into
alliance
with
them
disease
had
indeed
recently
reduced
their
numbers
in
many
of
the
villages
that
were
situated
in
the
dense
forest
and
were
thus
deprived
of
a
free
circulation
of
air
and
the
wigwams
at
which
tisquantum
party
had
arrived
were
among
those
that
had
suffered
most
severely
several
of
the
lodges
had
been
altogether
deserted
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
the
proprietors
in
which
case
the
indians
frequently
strip
off
the
thick
mats
which
form
the
outer
covering
of
the
wigwam
and
leave
the
bare
poles
a
perishing
monument
of
desolation
this
is
only
done
when
the
head
of
the
family
dies
the
property
of
which
he
has
not
otherwise
disposed
during
his
life
is
then
buried
with
him
and
his
friends
continue
for
a
long
period
to
revisit
the
grave
and
make
offerings
of
food
arms
and
cooking
utensils
these
articles
are
deemed
sacred
to
the
spirit
of
the
departed
and
no
indian
would
think
of
taking
them
away
unless
he
replaced
them
with
something
of
equal
value
this
is
permitted
and
the
custom
must
often
afford
relief
to
the
hungry
traveler
through
the
forests
who
comes
unexpectedly
upon
the
burial
grounds
of
some
of
his
race
and
finds
the
graves
amply
supplied
with
maize
and
tobacco
more
useful
to
the
living
than
to
the
dead
many
such
graves
besides
that
of
uncas
were
to
be
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cree
village

it
seemed
likely
that
their
numbers
would
be
still
augmented

fatal

all
necessary
to
the
arts
and
practices
of
a
powow
on
the
venerable
terah
his
skill
and
patience
were
principally
exercised
and
many
were
the
torments
that
he
inflicted
on
the
dying
old
savage
and
which
were
borne
by
the
pince
with
all
the
calm
endurance
that
became
his
dignity
and
reputation
terah
like
all
others
of
his
exalted
rank
had
attained
to
the
honor
of
being
a
pince
by
serving
a
hard
apprenticeship
to
suffering
and
privation
in
his
early
youth
he
had
passed
through
the
ordeal
triumphantly
and
he
who
had
run
barefoot
through
sharp
and
tearing
thorns
who
had
endured
to
have
his
shins
beaten
with
a
hard
and
heavy
mallet
and
his
flesh
burned
with
red
hot
had
not
even
betrayed
a
sense
of
pain
in
order
to
attain
the
rank
of
a
great
counselor
and
the
privilege
of
attending
the
sachem
as
one
of
his
guard
of
honor
did
not
shrink
when
his
barbarous
physician
burned
a
blister
on
his
chest
with
ashes
and
scarified
the
horny
soles
of
his
feet
till
the
blood
flowed
plentifully
those
and
strong
emetic
herbs
which
he
forced
his
patient
to
repeat
until
he
fainted
away
constituted
the
medical
treatment
of
tisquantum
but
much
greater
benefit
was
expected
and
such
is
the
power
of
imagination
in
these
ignorant
savages
that
it
was
often
attained
from
the
practice
of
his
charms
and
conjurations
as
soon
as
tisquantum
saw
his
noble
patient
reduced
to
a
state
of
unconsciousness
by
his
physical
treatment
he
commenced
a
course
of
spiritual
incantations
in
a
fierce
and
unnatural
voice
he
called
on
hobbamock
or
satan
who
he
declared
was
visible
to
him
in
one
of
his
many
forms
of
an
eagle
a
deer
a
fawn
and
sometimes
a
gigantic
human
being
he
then
adjured
the
evil
spirit
and
commanded
him
to
remove
the
disease
promising
in
return
to
offer
to
him
skins
and
hatchets
and
even
the
scalps
of
his
foes
if
any
signs
of
returning
consciousness
appeared
the
powow
speedily
banished
them
by
a
repetition
of
his
wild
howling
which
he
continued
for
hours
at
the
same
time
throwing
himself
about
with
wild
and
unnatural
gestures
and
striking
his
hands
violently
on
his
legs
until
he
became
as
much
exhausted
as
his
unlucky
patient
it
was
during
one
of
these
awful
exhibitions
of
heathen
cruelty
and
superstition
that
henrich
one
evening
drew
nigh
to
the
lodge
of
terah
accompanied
by
oriana
and
paused
at
the
open
entrance
in
amazement
and
horror
at
the
scene
he
beheld
the
dying
man
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
in
the
center
of
the
outer
room
of
the
hut
where
he
had
been
placed
that
he
might
enjoy
the
full
benefit
of
the
great
powow
skill
his
eyes
were
closed
and
his
gray
hairs
hung
matted
end
disordered
on
the
ground
while
his
emaciated
features
appeared
to
be
fixed
in
death
a
frightful
wound
was
on
his
breast
and
blood
was
trickling
from
his
lacerated
feet
while
the
involuntary
contractions
of
his
limbs
alone
denoted
that
he
was
yet
alive
and
sensible
to
suffering
which
he
was
now
unable
to
make
any
effort
to
conceal
around
the
walls
of
the
hut
stood
many
of
his
relatives
and
dependants
whose
countenances
expressed
anxiety
and
hope
mingled
with
fear
of
the
priestly
sachem
among
the
bystanders
henrich
instantly
recognized
his
friend
jyanough
and
he
shuddered
to
see
the
ingenious
and
inquiring
youth
assisting
at
such
satanic
rites
but
the
figure
that
chiefly
attracted
his
attention
and
to
which
his
eyes
became
riveted
was
that
of
tisquantum
the
father
of
his
gentle
and
beloved
oriana
there
stood
the
sachem
he
whose
countenance
he
had
seldom
seen
disturbed
from
his
usual
expression
of
gravity
and
composure
and
whose
dignity
of
manner
had
hitherto
always
commanded
his
respect
there
he
now
stood
a
victim
to
satanic
influence
his
tall
figure
was
dilated
to
its
utmost
height
by
excitement
and
violent
muscular
effort
as
he
stood
by
the
side
of
the
sick
man
his
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
fearful
and
unmeaning
glare
on
the
darkest
corner
of
the
hut
and
seemed
to
be
starting
from
their
sockets
while
his
hands
stiff
and
motionless
were
extended
over
the
body
of
terah
as
if
to
guard
him
from
the
assault
of
some
demons
visible
to
the
conjuror
alone
in
this
posture
he
remained
for
some
moments
while
his
breast
heaved
convulsively
and
foam
gathered
on
his
parted
lips
then
suddenly
he
uttered
a
yell
so
loud
and
so
unearthly
that
henrich
started
with
surprise
and
terror
and
oriana
caught
his
hand
and
tried
to
draw
him
away
from
a
scene
that
now
filled
her
soul
with
shame
and
sorrow
but
henrich
did
not
move
he
did
not
heed
the
beseeching
voice
and
the
gentle
violence
of
his
companion
whose
wishes
were
generally
commands
to
her
white
brother
that
yell
had
recalled
the
patient
to
partial
consciousness
and
he
rolled
his
eyes
around
him
as
if
endeavoring
to
collect
his
wandering
senses
and
then
his
haggard
countenance
again
resumed
the
expression
of
imperturbable
composure
and
firm
endurance
that
an
indian
warrior
thinks
it
a
disgrace
to
lose
even
in
the
extremity
of
suffering
then
tisquantum
sank
on
one
knee
beside
him
and
burst
forth
into
a
passionate
address
to
his
deities
the
powers
of
good
and
evil
whom
he
regarded
as
almost
equally
mighty
to
decide
the
fate
of
the
patient
mahneto
he
exclaimed
in
a
hoarse
and
howling
voice
who
created
the
first
man
and
woman
out
of
a
stone
and
placed
them
in
these
forests
to
be
the
parents
of
thy
red
children
is
it
thy
will
that
terah
shall
leave
his
brethren
to
mourn
his
departed
goodness
and
wisdom
and
go
on
that
long
and
toilsome
journey
that
leads
to
the
of
our
forefathers
surely
when
his
spirit
at
the
door
it
will
be
opened
to
him
and
the
warriors
of
our
tribe
will
welcome
him
while
his
foes
will
be
driven
away
with
the
awful
sentence
yes
terah
the
wise
in
counsel
and
the
fearless
in
war
shall
surely
dwell
in
the
fields
of
happiness
and
again
strike
the
prey
with
the
renewed
strength
and
skill
of
his
youth

cried
and

fixed
his
glaring
eyes
on
the
dark
space

the
far
corner
of
the
hut
from
which
the
spectators
had
shrunk

closed
his

with

and

yell
to
which
all
the
spectators
who
crowded
the
sides
of
the
hut
replied
by
a
short
and

cry
and
the

sank
on

ground
by
the
side

his

faint
and
exhausted
by
the
violent
and
sustained
exertions
to
which
both
his
mind
and
body
had
been
subjected
for
several
hours
without
intermission
the
attendants
among
whom
jyanough
was
foremost
hastened
to
his
assistance
and
administered
to
him
some
needful
refreshment
and
henrich
turned
away
grieved
and
disgusted
and
fall
of
sympathy
for
his
once
heathen
companion
who
he
now
remembered
was
standing
by
his
side
and
witnessing
the
wild
and
degrading
extravagances
of
a
father
whom
she
both
loved
and
respected
he
looked
into
her
deep
expressive
eyes
and
saw
that
they
were
filled
with
tears
of
humiliation
and
mental
agony
how
could
it
be
otherwise
how
could
she
who
had
learned
to
love
a
god
of
mercy
and
to
believe
in
a
meek
and
lowly
savior
bear
to
see
her
father
thus
the
slave
of
satan
and
the
minister
of
cruel
and
heathen
superstition
especially
how
could
she
bear
that
so
degrading
a
scene
should
he
witnessed
by
him
from
whom
she
had
derived
all
she
knew
of
the
gospel
of
joy
and
peace
and
whose
esteem
was
more
precious
to
her
than
the
opinion
of
all
the
world
beside
silently
she
walked
by
henrich
side
for
neither
of
them
were
inclined
to
speak
the
thoughts
that
filled
their
minds
and
silently
they
would
have
proceeded
to
oriana
dwelling
where
her
white
brother
proposed
to
leave
her
with
her
attendants
and
then
to
return
and
seek
his
deluded
friend
jyanough
but
ere
they
reached
tisquantum
lodge
they
were
overtaken
by
the
indian
youth
jyanough
had
been
too
much
engrossed
by
the
exciting
scene
that
took
place
in
terah
dwelling
and
too
eagerly
watching
for
some
favorable
appearances
that
might
encourage
him
to
hope
for
the
life
of
his
only
surviving
relative
to
observe
that
henrich
was
also
a
spectator
of
these
heathen
rites
until
all
was
concluded
and
the
patient
and
his
physician
were
alike
overpowered
by
heat
and
exhaustion
then
he
had
glanced
towards
the
door
and
had
seen
the
saddened
expression
that
clouded
the
open
features
of
the
christian
youth
and
the
look
of
anguish
that
oriana
cast
on
her
degraded
father
and
then
all
the
truths
that
henrich
had
endeavored
so
simply
and
so
patiently
to
impress
upon
his
mind
all
the
arguments
that
his
white
friend
had
employed
to
win
him
from
heathen
darkness
and
guide
him
into
divine
truth
rushed
at
once
upon
his
memory
he
felt
ashamed
of
the
remaining
superstition
that
had
led
him
to
take
part
in
such
vain
ceremonies
and
to
deem
that
they
could
conduce
to
his
uncle
recovery
after
he
had
heard
and
even
assented
to
the
holy
belief
of
the
christians
in
the
universal
power
of
almighty
god
and
the
victory
of
his
son
jesus
christ
over
the
devil
and
all
his
angels
and
he
was
grieved
also
that
his
kind
and
anxious
young
teacher
should
regard
him
as
an
ungrateful
and
possibly
even
as
a
deceitful
hearer
he
therefore
hastened
after
henrich
and
oriana
and
overtook
them
as
they
approached
the
lodge
appropriated
to
the
nausett
sachem
you
angry
with
your
red
brother
he
inquired
earnestly
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
henrich
shoulder
and
looked
sadly
in
his
face
you
think
that
jyanough
is
a
deceiver
and
that
he
has
listened
to
the
teaching
of
the
white
stranger
only
to
gain
his
friendship
and
then
to
forsake
him
and
betray
him
and
return
to
the
religion
of
his
own
people
o
no
jyanough
heart
is
open
and
clear
before
the
eyes
of
his
friend
and
he
will
gladly
listen
again
to
all
the
good
things
that
henrich
tells
him
for
his
heart
says
that
they
are
true
but
his
soul
is
still
very
dark
and
when
he
saw
terah
ready
to
die
and
felt
that
when
he
was
gone
there
would
be
none
to
love
him
among
all
his
tribe
the
cloud
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
seemed
to
look
out
of
the
midst
of
the
deep
gloom
with
wrathful
eyes
of
fire
and
beckon
him
to
follow
to
terah
lodge
and
join
in
the
worship
which
the
great
powow
was
about
to
offer
will
your
mahneto
forgive
him
henrich
the
heart
of
the
christian
boy
was
penetrated
with
joy
and
thankfulness
at
this
frank
confession
of
the
young
indian
he
clearly
saw
that
the
struggle
the
universal
and
enduring
struggle
between
the
powers
of
good
and
evil
had
already
commenced
in
the
soul
of
the
red
man
and
he
had
full
confidence
in
the
blessed
declaration
that
who
hath
begun
a
good
work
of
grace
in
the
immortal
spirit
will
surely
perfect
it
unto
the
end
therefore
he
replied
without
hesitation
will
certainly
forgive
you
jyanough
and
if
you
desire
his
help
to
make
your
soul
light
and
strong
and
joyful
and
ask
for
that
help
in
sincerity
and
truth
he
will
most
assuredly
give
it
to
you
let
us
enter
the
lodge
and
there
unite
our
prayers
to
the
great
spirit
who
is
the
god
and
father
of
all
his
creatures
that
he
will
graciously
shed
his
light
and
his
truth
into
all
our
hearts
and
especially
that
he
will
remove
all
the
doubts
and
fears
that
still
lie
sadly
and
heavily
on
our
brother
spirit
the
three
young
friends
did
so
and
in
the
deserted
chamber
of
the
great
heathen
powow
tisquantum
the
voice
of
christian
supplication
ascended
to
the
throne
of
a
god
could
it
ascend
unheeded
or
fail
to
bring
down
in
his
own
good
time
an
answer
of
peace

full

of

lxxiv
the
night
that
followed
this
conversation
jyanough
passed
in
lodge
and
he
nursed
his
suffering
relative
with
gentle
patience
but
he
saw
no
signs
of
recovery
although
the
women
and
the
cree
powows
assured
him
that
the
fatal
disease
was
driven
away
by
powerful
incantations
and
that
when
the
sun
rose
he
would
see
the
spirit
of
terah
revive
so
had
the
conjuror
declared
and
so
these
misguided
heathens
believed
but
when
the
first
beams
of
opening
day
entered
the
door
of
the
lodge
which
was
set
open
to
receive
them
and
fell
on
the
dark
and
pallid
features
of
the
aged
sufferer
jyanough
could
no
longer
be
deceived
into
hope
he
saw
that
his
revered
uncle
was
dying
and
he
hastened
to
inform
henrich
of
the
fact
and
to
entreat
him
to
return
with
him
to
terah
wigwam
and
to
prey
to
the
great
spirit
in
his
behalf
henrich
readily
complied
and
he
too
was
convinced
by
the
first
glance
at
the
dying
indian
that
no
human
aid
however
skilful
could
long
retain
that
once
powerful
spirit
in
its
worn
and
wasted
tenement
of
clay
he
knelt
down
by
the
side
of
terah
couch
and
jyanough
knelt
with
him
and
regardless
of
the
wondering
gaze
of
the
ignorant
attendants
he
offered
up
a
short
and
simple
prayer
to
god
for
the
soul
of
the
departing
warrior
the
cree
powows
who
had
watched
the
sick
man
during
the
night
had
left
the
lodge
as
soon
as
daylight
set
in
to
collect
materials
for
a
great
burnt
offering
they
deigned
to
make
as
a
last
resource
in
front
of
the
pince
dwelling
as
henrich
and
jyanough
rose
from
their
knees
the
heathen
priest
entered
bearing
strings
of
wampum
articles
of
furniture
of
clothing
food
tobacco
and
everything
of
any
value
that
they
had
been
able
to
obtain
from
the
friends
of
terah
all
these
various
articles
were
displayed
before
the
dim
eyes
of
the
invalid
for
whose
benefit
they
were
to
be
reduced
to
a
heap
of
useless
ashes
and
a
faint
smile
of
satisfaction
passed
over
terah
countenance
but
he
spoke
not
jyanough
then
bent
down
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
cold
brow
of
his
almost
unconscious
uncle
and
hurried
with
henrich
from
the
lodge
for
he
could
not
bear
again
to
witness
any
repetition
of
the
heathen
ceremonies
that
had
caused
him
so
much
shame
the
preceding
day
neither
could
he
endure
to
see
his
last
relative
leave
the
world
surrounded
by
a
spiritual
darkness
which
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
dispel
the
young
friends
took
their
way
into
the
forest
that
they
might
be
beyond
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
those
rites
that
were
about
to
be
performed
for
the
recovery
of
one
who
had
already
begun
to
travel
through
valley
of
the
shadow
of
they
had
not
however
gone
far
in
a
westerly
direction
before
they
chanced
their
intention
and
resolved
to
return
to
the
village
the
cause
of
this
change
of
purpose
was
their
meeting
with
a
band
of
cree
warriors
who
had
gone
out
some
weeks
previously
on
an
expedition
against
a
settlement
of
their
enemies
the
stone
indians
and
were
now
returning
from
the
plains
of
the
saskatchawan
laden
with
spoils
many
of
the
crees
bore
scalps
suspended
from
their
belts
as
bloody
trophies
of
victory
and
all
had
arms
and
skins
and
ornaments
that
they
had
carried
away
from
the
pillaged
wigwams
of
their
foes
henrich
could
not
help
gazing
with
admiration
at
the
party
of
warriors
as
they
approached
the
greater
part
of
them
were
mounted
on
beautiful
and
spirited
horses
of
the
wild
breed
of
the
western
prairies
which
they
rode
with
an
ease
and
grace
that
astonished
the
young
englishman
they
wore
no
covering
on
their
heads
and
their
black
hair
was
cut
short
except
one
long
hanging
behind
so
that
their
fine
countenances
which
were
rather
of
the
roman
cast
were
fully
exposed
to
view
their
dress
consisted
of
a
large
blanket
wrapped
gracefully
round
the
waist
and
confined
by
a
belt
so
as
to
leave
the
bust
and
arms
bare
and
so
perfect
and
muscular
were
their
figures
that
they
had
the
appearance
of
noble
bronze
statues
their
native
weapons
consisting
of
spears
and
bows
with
highly
ornamented
quivers
suspended
from
their
shoulders
and
hung
to
their
belts
added
much
to
their
martial
and
picturesque
effect
behind
the
horsemen
followed
a
band
on
foot
who
carried
the
stolen
treasures
of
the
wasted
village
and
henrich
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
various
and
beautifully
decorated
articles
of
dress
and
hunting
equipments
that
had
formed
the
pride
and
the
wealth
of
the
defeated
stone
indians
but
the
part
of
the
spoil
that
interested
and
distressed
both
henrich
and
his
companion
more
than
all
the
rest
was
a
young
indian
warrior
who
with
his
wife
and
her
infant
had
been
brought
away
as
prisoners
to
add
to
the
triumph
and
probably
to
glut
the
vengeance
of
their
conquerors
there
was
an
unextinguished
fire
in
the
eye
of
the
captive
and
an
expression
of
fearless
indignation
in
the
proud
bearing
with
which
he
strode
by
the
side
of
his
captors
that
clearly
told
how
bravely
he
would
sell
his
life
but
for
the
cords
that
tightly
bound
his
wrists
behind
him
and
were
held
by
a
powerful
cree
on
each
side
behind
him
walked
his
wife
with
downcast
features
and
faltering
steps
and
at
her
back
hung
her
little
infant
suspended
in
a
bag
or
pouch
of
deer
skin
half
filled
with
the
soft
so
much
used
by
indian
squaws
to
form
the
bed
and
indeed
the
only
covering
of
their
children
during
the
first
year
of
their
existence
the
eyes
of
the
captive
young
mother
were
fixed
tearfully
on
the
majestic
form
of
her
husband
who
was
too
proud
perhaps
also
too
sad
to
turn
and
meet
her
gaze
while
the
eyes
of
his
foes
were
upon
him
to
detect
his
slightest
weakness
even
the
low
wailing
cry
of
her
child
was
unheeded
by
this
broken
hearted
wife
in
that
sad
hour
for
she
well
knew
the
customs
of
indian
warfare
and
she
had
no
hope
for
the
life
of
her
warrior
even
if
her
own
should
be
spared
henrich
gazed
on
the
little
group
in
pity
for
be
instinctively
read
their
story
and
their
coming
fate
in
their
countenances
and
in
the
cruel
glances
that
fell
on
them
from
their
guards
he
looked
at
jyanough
and
in
his
expressive
features
he
saw
a
fell
confirmation
of
his
worst
fears
will
sacrifice
them
to
in
the
vain
hope
of
lengthening
terah
life
he
softly
whispered
in
henrich
ear
us
go
back
and
seek
oriana
perhaps
for
her
sake
tisquantum
may
ask
the
lives
of
the
squaw
and
her
young
child
and
as
chingook
honored
guest
they
would
be
granted
to
him
but
there
is
no
hope
for
the
warrior
his
blood
will
surely
be
shed
to
appease
and
to
atone
for
the
death
of
several
of
the
cree
braves
who
have
fallen
this
year
by
the
hands
of
the
stone
tribe
hastily
henrich
turned
and
followed
by
jyanough
took
a
well
known
to
them
and
entered
the
village
before
the
arrival
of
the
warriors
and
their
unhappy
prisoners
a
brief
explanation
was
sufficient
to
enlist
all
the
kindly
feelings
and
all
the
christian
spirit
of
oriana
in
favor
of
their
project
and
she
lost
no
time
in
seeking
her
father
who
had
again
repaired
to
terah
hut
to
superintend
the
costly
sacrifice
that
was
being
offered
in
his
behalf
she
found
him
exulting
in
a
partial
improvement
in
his
patient
whose
senses
had
again
returned
with
a
brief
and
deceitful
brilliance
and
attributing
what
he
called
the
aged
pince
recovery
to
the
potency
of
his
own
spells
this
was
no
time
for
oriana
to
argue
with
the
elated
powow
on
the
fallacy
of
his
pretensions
she
therefore
listened
patiently
to
his
boastings
and
then
with
much
feeling
and
natural
eloquence
told
him
the
cause
of
her
interrupting
him
at
such
a
moment
and
besought
him
to
exert
all
his
great
influence
with
the
crees
to
induce
them
to
spare
the
lives
of
the
stone
captives
tisquantum
listened
with
attention
to
her
story
and
her
petition
for
he
was
always
gentle
to
oriana
but
he
gave
her
little
hope
of
that
fell
success
which
her
warm
young
heart
desired
and
anticipated
child
he
said
will
do
what
you
ask
so
far
as
to
request
that
the
woman
and
child
may
be
placed
at
your
disposal
but
the
life
i
can
not
demand
for
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
brave
crees
to
suppose
that
they
would
suffer
an
enemy
to
escape
and
tell
his
tribe
that
they
were
no
he
must
die
and
if
the
soul
of
his
ancestors
dwells
in
him
he
will
exult
in
the
opportunity
of
showing
how
even
a
stone
indian
can
meet
death
oriana
was
repulsed
but
not
defeated
by
this
reply
my
father
she
again
began
save
all
or
let
all
perish
do
not
take
the
brave
young
warrior
from
his
wife
and
child
and
leave
them
in
poverty
and
sorrow
but
plead
for
mercy
to
be
shown
to
him
also
and
so
may
mercy
be
shown
to
his
conquerors
and
to
you
his
deliverer
when
child
interrupted
the
sachem
with
more
asperity
than
he
usually
showed
to
oriana
are
the
notions
you
have
learned
from
your
white
brother
and
i
desire
not
to
hear
them
tisquantum
knows
his
duty
i
will
demand
the
lives
of
the
woman
and
child
of
whom
you
speak
but
the
warrior
must
abide
his
fate
and
think
you
that
he
would
not
scorn
to
live
when
honor
is
gone
i
go
he
added
more
gently
as
he
saw
the
sorrow
that
dimmed
her
eye
and
tell
jyanough
to
meet
me
at
the
sachem
lodge
terah
may
yet
be
saved
this
victim
comes
at
s
happy
moment
and
surely
mahneto
demands
his
life
as
at
offering
for
that
of
the
venerable
pince
oriana
shuddered
at
what
she
saw
to
be
her
father
meaning
once
she
would
have
felt
as
he
did
and
have
believed
that
their
god
could
be
propitiated
by
blood
and
agony
but
now
she
knew
that
all
such
cruel
sacrifices
were
worse
than
vain
and
deeply
she
regretted
her
own
inability
to
bring
her
countrymen
and
especially
her
own
beloved
father
to
a
knowledge
of
the
gospel
of
mercy
and
peace
and
thus
save
them
from
imbruing
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
their
fellow
men
and
thinking
that
they
did
good
service
to
the
great
spirit
she
hurried
back
to
her
companions
and
weeping
told
them
of
her
partial
success
it
was
all
and
more
than
all
that
jyanough
expected
and
he
immediately
went
to
meet
tisquantum
at
the
lodge
of
the
cree
sachem
chingook
where
he
found
the
war
party
and
their
prisoners
assembled
after
a
few
words
to
jyanough
tisquantum
commenced
a
long
speech
to
his
brother
sachem
in
which
he
dilated
on
the
friendship
that
subsisted
between
them
and
the
joy
that
he
had
felt
in
exercising
his
skill
for
the
benefit
of
the
brave
and
hospitable
crees
he
then
spoke
of
terah
perilous
condition
and
his
fears
that
even
his
powers
had
been
baffled
by
the
spirit
of
evil
and
that
the
pince
would
yet
be
taken
from
them
unless
some
offering
could
be
found
more
precious
than
all
that
were
now
piled
before
his
dwelling
and
only
waited
for
the
auspicious
moment
to
be
wrapped
inflame
us
a
sacrifice
to
the
offended
deity
who
had
brought
the
pestilence
have
we
not
such
an
offering
here
he
added
pointing
to
the
captive
warrior
who
stood
with
head
erect
awaiting
the
sentence
that
he
knew
would
be
pronounced
we
not
here
a
victim
sent
by
mahneto
himself
at
the
very
moment
when
terah
life
seems
hanging
on
a
breath
lead
him
then
to
the
sacred
pile
and
as
his
soul
goes
forth
the
soul
of
terah
shall
revive
this
speech
was
received
with
acclamations
by
the
crees
and
already
the
warriors
were
hurrying
away
their
captive
while
his
wife
followed
as
if
mechanically
to
share
her
husband
fate
bat
here
tisquantum
interposed
and
in
his
daughter
name
requested
the
life
of
the
woman
and
her
child
his
request
was
readily
granted
by
chingook
for
of
what
value
was
a
squaw
in
the
eyes
of
these
indian
braves
the
daughter
of
our
friend
and
benefactor
shall
be
denied
nothing
that
she
asks
replied
the
cree
chief
the
woman
to
oriana
lodge
and
let
her
be
her
slave
jyanough
approached
to
lead
away
the
unhappy
woman
but
she
turned
on
him
a
look
of
despairing
misery
and
laying
her
band
on
her
arm
said
quickly
will
see
my
lincoya
die
and
then
i
will
follow
you
where
you
will
for
mailah
has
no
home
jyanough
did
not
oppose
her
for
his
heart
was
touched
by
her
sorrow
and
her
fortitude
and
the
captive
warrior
turned
his
head
and
bent
on
her
sad
countenance
one
look
of
tenderness
and
approbation
that
told
how
deeply
he
was
sensible
of
her
devotion
he
did
not
speak
perchance
he
could
not
trust
his
voice
in
that
trying
moment
but
he
followed
his
guards
and
his
eye
was
again
steadfast
and
his
step
was
firm
henrich
and
oriana
waited
anxiously
for
the
return
of
jyanough
but
he
came
not
and
they
almost
feared
that
tisquantum
request
had
been
too
coldly
urged
to
prove
successful
it
was
a
calm
autumnal
day
and
as
the
sun
rose
high
in
the
heavens
his
beams
were
shrouded
by
heavy
thunder
clouds
while
a
low
and
distant
murmur
foretold
an
approaching
storm
and
added
to
the
gloom
that
weighed
heavily
on
oriana
spirit
all
the
sin
and
degradation
of
the
faith
of
her
countrymen
seemed
to
strike
upon
her
mind
with
a
force
hitherto
unknown
and
to
bow
her
down
in
shame
and
sadness
even
to
henrich
to
her
loved
christian
friend
and
teacher
she
could
not
now
utter
her
feelings
and
when
to
divert
her
thoughts
and
remove
her
from
the
village
where
he
knew
so
cruel
a
scene
would
soon
be
enacted
he
led
her
towards
the
forest
she
followed
him
silently
they
seated
themselves
beneath
an
overshadowing
tree
and
for
some
time
no
sound
broke
the
oppressive
silence
save
the
soft
rustling
of
the
leaves
that
seemed
to
be
moved
by
the
spirits
of
the
no
wind
was
stirring
presently
a
shriek
one
single
cry
of
agony
arose
from
the
village
and
all
was
still
again
was
a
woman
voice
exclaimed
oriana
in
a
tone
of
deep
suffering
henrich
they
murder
the
helpless
and
the
innocent
and
my
father
consents
to
the
deed
henrich
did
not
reply
he
had
no
comfort
to
offer
but
they
both
gazed
towards
the
village
as
if
hoping
to
discover
through
the
impervious
wood
that
surrounded
it
some
indications
of
what
was
going
on
in
those
of
soon
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
rose
high
in
the
still
at
and
flames
shot
up
above
the
intervening
trees
and
then
burst
forth
a
mingled
din
of
wild
unearthly
sounds
that
told
of
sated
vengeance
and
malignant
joy
and
demoniac
worship
fiercely
the
war
cry
of
the
crees
rang
in
the
air
while
above
it
rose
the
shrill
sound
of
clashing
spears
and
tomahawks
and
oriana
knew
that
the
savages
were
dancing
round
a
fire
and
calling
on
mahneto
to
accept
their
bloody
offering
but
now
the
threatening
storm
broke
suddenly
on
that
dark
place
of
the
earth
and
it
seemed
to
oriana
troubled
spirit
that
the
wrath
of
heaven
was
poured
upon
her
benighted
race
peal
after
peal
resounded
in
quick
succession
and
reverberated
from
the
distant
kills
while
flashes
of
forked
lightning
followed
one
another
rapidly
and
dispelled
for
a
moment
the
unnatural
darkness
the
young
indian
clung
trembling
and
terrified
to
her
companion
and
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
to
shut
out
the
fearful
scene
while
henrich
spoke
to
her
words
of
comfort
and
encouragement
and
at
length
succeeded
in
calming
her
agitation
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
but
so
dense
was
the
foliage
that
hung
over
oriana
and
her
companion
that
it
could
not
penetrate
their
place
of
refuge
and
they
remained
awaiting
its
cessation
and
watching
the
curling
smoke
that
seemed
to
die
away
as
the
falling
torrent
extinguished
the
fire
but
as
it
disappeared
another
cloud
arose
near
the
same
spot
and
wider
and
fiercer
flames
sprang
up
that
defied
the
rain
and
continued
to
burn
with
more
and
more
strength
whence
could
they
arise
surely
the
wigwams
were
on
fire
henrich
communicated
this
fear
to
oriana
and
they
arose
and
hurried
together
towards
the
village
where
an
appalling
scene
met
their
eyes
in
front
of
terah
dwelling
were
the
smoldering
remains
of
the
sacrificial
fire
on
which
still
upheld
by
the
stake
to
which
he
had
been
bound
the
burnt
and
blackened
form
of
a
man
was
visible
while
close
by
the
ashes
lay
a
woman
so
motionless
that
she
seemed
as
totally
deprived
of
life
as
the
wretched
victim
himself
and
a
child
was
reclining
on
her
shoulder
whose
faint
wailing
cry
showed
that
it
yet
lived
and
suffered
none
heeded
the
melancholy
group
for
the
warriors
whose
wild
songs
and
frantic
dances
had
been
interrupted
by
the
sudden
violence
of
the
storm
were
all
now
engaged
in
fruitless
efforts
to
extinguish
the
flames
that
were
rapidly
consuming
the
lodge
of
terah
the
lightning
had
struck
it
and
ignited
its
roof
of
reeds
and
so
rapidly
had
the
whole
dwelling
become
a
prey
to
the
dreadful
element
that
even
the
removal
of
the
dying
sage
had
been
despaired
of
but
jyanough
who
had
been
a
silent
spectator
of
all
the
previous
scene
of
cruelty
was
not
to
be
daunted
by
the
smoke
and
flame
that
burst
through
the
entrance
and
drove
from
the
chamber
of
death
all
the
attendants
of
the
sufferer
boldly
he
rushed
into
terah
dwelling
and
just
as
henrich
and
oriana
entered
the
open
space
in
front
of
it
they
beheld
him
issuing
forth
blackened
with
smoke
and
scorched
with
fire
and
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
his
uncle
corpse
yes
terah
was
already
a
corpse
all
the
charms
and
incantations
of
the
powows
bad
failed
to
banish
the
disease
that
was
sent
to
summon
him
away
all
the
treasure
that
had
been
destroyed
and
the
precious
blood
that
had
been
spilled
to
propitiate
false
deities
could
not
for
one
moment
arrest
the
fiat
of
the
true
of
life
or
detain
the
spirit
which
was
recalled
by
who
gave
it
that
spirit
had
passed
away
amidst
the
noise
of
the
tempest
and
when
henrich
sprang
forward
and
assisted
his
friend
to
lay
the
body
gently
on
the
earth
they
saw
that
the
spark
of
life
had
fled
all
further
attempts
at
extinguishing
the
fire
were
now
abandoned
and
the
crees
gathered
round
their
departed
friend
to
condole
with
jyanough
who
was
his
nearest
relative
and
to
commence
that
dismal
howling
by
which
they
express
their
grief
on
such
occasions
all
the
property
of
the
dead
man
was
already
consumed
but
the
best
mats
and
skins
that
wigwam
contained
were
brought
to
wrap
the
corpse
in
and
when
the
site
of
his
former
dwelling
could
be
cleared
of
ashes
and
rubbish
a
grave
was
speedily
dug
in
the
center
of
it
and
the
body
laid
by
the
simple
sepulchre
around
which
the
friends
of
the
venerated
pince
seated
themselves
and
howled
and
wept
and
detailed
the
virtues
and
the
wisdom
of
the
dead
jyanough
was
expected
to
act
the
part
of
chief
mourner
in
these
ceremonies
and
the
real
affection
he
had
entertained
for
his
uncle
induced
him
to
comply
and
to
remain
all
that
day
and
all
the
following
night
at
the
grate
but
he
refused
to
cover
his
face
with
soot
as
is
customary
on
such
occasions
of
domestic
sorrow
or
to
join
the
powows
in
their
frantic
cries
and
exorcisms
to
drive
off
the
weettakos
from
sucking
the
dead
man
blood
the
presence
of
henrich
seemed
to
annoy
and
irritate
these
priests
of
satan
and
he
was
glad
to
retire
from
a
scene
so
repugnant
to
his
better
feelings
and
to
return
to
oriana
by
whose
care
and
direction
the
unhappy
mailah
and
her
infant
had
been
promptly
removed
from
the
place
of
death
and
desolation
and
conveyed
to
her
own
apartment
in
lodge
her
kind
efforts
had
restored
the
poor
young
widow
to
consciousness
and
she
now
sat
on
the
floor
with
her
child
on
her
knee
listening
with
a
calmness
that
almost
seemed
apathy
to
the
words
of
comfort
that
were
uttered
by
the
gentle
mailah
was
very
young
scarcely
sixteen
summers
had
passed
over
her
head
and
yet
such
is
indian
life
she
had
already
been
a
wife
and
a
mother
and
now
alas
she
was
a
widow
her
grief
had
been
passionate
at
the
last
and
had
burst
forth
in
that
one
wild
cry
that
had
startled
ear
in
the
forest
but
that
was
over
now
and
she
seemed
resigned
to
her
hard
fate
and
willing
to
endure
it
perhaps
this
was
for
her
infant
sake
and
perhaps
her
sensibilities
were
blunted
by
the
life
she
had
led
in
common
with
the
rest
of
her
race
and
sex
a
life
in
which
the
best
feelings
and
sympathies
of
our
nature
are
almost
unknown
it
was
not
until
oriana
led
her
to
speak
of
her
past
life
and
the
home
of
her
youth
now
desolate
and
in
ruins
that
tears
of
natural
grief
flowed
from
her
eyes
then
she
seemed
roused
to
a
full
sense
of
all
she
had
lost
end
broke
out
into
mournful
lamentations
for
her
murdered
lincoya
whose
noble
qualities
and
high
lineage
she
eloquently
extolled
while
she
sadly
contrasted
her
present
lonely
and
desolate
position
with
her
happiness
as
the
squaw
of
so
distinguished
a
warrior
and
so
successful
a
hunter
oriana
said
all
she
could
to
console
her
and
assured
her
of
her
protection
and
friendship
and
of
a
home
in
her
lodge
when
they
returned
to
their
own
country
where
she
should
live
as
her
sister
and
bring
up
her
little
lincoya
to
emulate
his
father
courage
and
virtues
and
ere
long
the
simple
young
savage
again
grew
calm
said
lifted
up
her
soft
black
eyes
and
smiled
gratefully
at
her
new
friend
and
benefactor
she
said
she
bad
no
wish
to
return
to
her
own
tribe
for
all
her
family
and
friends
had
been
destroyed
in
the
recent
massacre
and
the
village
where
she
had
spent
such
happy
days
was
reduced
to
ashes
she
therefore
was
well
content
to
remain
with
the
youthful
to
whose
intercession
she
knew
she
owed
her
own
life
and
that
of
her
child
and
in
whose
service
she
professed
her
willingness
to
live
and
die
her
manner
and
appearance
greatly
interested
henrich
for
they
were
marked
by
much
greater
refinement
than
he
had
seen
in
any
of
the
indian
females
except
oriana
this
was
to
be
accounted
for
by
her
noble
birth
for
in
those
days
the
indian
chieftains
prided
themselves
on
the
purity
and
nobility
of
their
lineage
and
no
member
of
a
family
was
allowed
to
marry
one
of
an
inferior
race
a
certain
air
of
dignity
generally
distinguished
the
privileged
class
even
among
the
females
although
their
lives
were
not
exempt
from
much
of
hardship
and
servitude
and
they
were
regarded
as
altogether
the
inferiors
of
their
lords
and
masters
to
oriana
the
arrival
of
the
young
mother
and
her
playful
child
was
a
source
of
much
pleasure
and
comfort
for
she
had
begun
to
feel
the
want
of
female
society
and
the
women
who
accompanied
tisquantum
party
and
assisted
her
in
the
domestic
duties
of
the
family
were
no
companions
to
her
in
mailah
she
saw
that
she
could
find
a
friend
and
her
kindness
and
sympathy
soon
attached
the
lonely
young
squaw
to
her
and
even
restored
her
to
cheerfulness
and
activity
it
was
only
when
she
visited
the
grave
in
which
henrich
and
jyanough
had
laid
the
murdered
lincoya
and
decked
it
with
flowers
and
green
boughs
that
the
widow
seemed
to
feel
the
greatness
of
her
affliction
then
she
would
weep
bitterly
and
with
passionate
gestures
lament
her
brave
warrior
but
at
other
times
she
was
fully
occupied
with
the
care
of
her
little
lincoya
or
in
assisting
oriana
in
the
light
household
duties
that
devolved
upon
her
and
her
sweet
voice
was
often
heard
singing
to
the
child
which
generally
hung
at
her
back

in
its
soft
bed

the
camp
of
the
indian
hunters
looked
cheerful
and
picturesque
as
oriana
and
mailah
approached
it
one
evening
on
their
return
from
a
ramble
in
the
forest
where
they
had
been
to
seek
the
wild
fruits
that
now
abounded
there
and
paused
at
the
skirt
of
the
wood
to
admire
the
scene
before
them
the
proposed
had
been
reached
the
preceding
day
and
already
the
temporary
huts
were
completed
and
the
tents
of
the
sachem
pitched
beneath
a
grove
of
lofty
oaks
and
walnuts
free
from
underwood
and
on
the
border
of
a
clear
and
rippling
stream
the
nausett
and
pequodee
hunters
had
purchased
a
considerable
number
of
horses
from
their
cree
friends
and
therefore
the
journey
from
chingook
village
to
the
prairie
in
which
the
encampment
now
stood
had
been
performed
with
much
ease
and
expedition
and
the
hardy
animals
were
so
little
fatigued
by
their
march
through
the
forest
that
several
of
the
younger
indians
had
mounted
again
the
morning
after
their
arrival
and
gone
off
on
a
reconnoitering
expedition
to
discover
what
prospect
there
was
of
finding
much
game
in
that
neighborhood
henrich
proud
and
happy
in
the
possession
of
a
spirited
horse
with
which
tisquantum
had
presented
him
insisted
on
being
one
of
the
party

he
was
accompanied
also
by
jyanough
who
had
left
his
native
village
now
rendered
sad
and
gloomy
in
his
eyes
to
follow
his
white
friend
and
share
his
society
at
least
for
a
time
this
arrangement
gave
henrich
the
greatest
satisfaction
for
the
young
cree
was
the
only
indian
of
his
own
sex
in
whom
he
had
been
able
to
find
a
companion
or
who
had
peculiarly
attached
himself
to
the
stranger
and
the
more
he
saw
of
jyanough
the
more
he
found
in
him
to
win
his
esteem
and
friendship
oriana
and
mailah
seated
themselves
on
the
luxuriant
grass
to
rest
and
the
young
indian
mother
removed
her
child
from
the
strange
cradle
in
which
she
always
carried
it
and
laid
it
on
her
knees
and
then
after
gazing
at
it
for
a
few
moments
she
began
to
sing
a
wild
sweet
song
to
hush
it
to
sleep
in
a
soft
monotonous
cadence
she
sang
the
sad
story
of
its
little
life
its
birth
its
captivity
and
the
death
of
its
murdered
father
whom
she
exhorted
it
to
imitate
and
live
to
equal
in
courage
and
in
skill
and
thus
she
sang
of
the
slain

in
peace

mother
wakes
to
guard
thee
but
where
is
he
whose
smile
once
fell
on
thee
as
sunshine
thy
father
lincoya
he
is
gone
to
the
far
distant
and
there
again
he
casts
the
spear
and
there
he
draws
the
unerring
bow
and
there
he
quaffs
the
cup
of
immortality
with
the
spirits
of
the
good
and
brave
o
lincoya
thy
voice
was
to
me
as
a
sweet
song
or
as
the
summer
breeze
among
the
tall
cypress
trees
why
didst
thou
leave
me
thy
step
was
swift
and
graceful
as
the
roe
upon
the
mountains
why
didst
thou
leave
me

oriana
listened
to
the
mournful
chant
of
the
young
widow
with
much
interest
and
sympathy
but
when
she
spoke
of
her
love
for
her
white
brother
in
terms
so
new
and
strange
she
almost
felt
offended
she
did
not
however
remark
on
her
friend
allusion
to
herself
but
turned
the
discourse
to
mailah
sad
prophecy
of
her
own
early
death
which
she
knew
could
only
be
grounded
on
one
of
the
wild
superstitions
of
her
race
do
you
talk
of
dying
mailah
she
asked
are
young
and
strong
and
you
may
again
be
happy
why
do
you
say
you
will
leave
your
child
and
go
to
the
land
of
spirits
called
to
me
last
night
as
i
sat
at
the
open
door
of
the
hut
and
looked
at
the
moon
and
thought
how
its
soft
light
was
guiding
my
lincoya
on
long
long
journey
to
the
everlasting
hunting
fields
of
his
fathers
called
me
twice
from
the
tree
that
hung
over
the
lodge
but
when
i
called
to
it
again
and
whistled
clearly
it
made
no
answer
i
heard
it
the
day
before
the
crees
destroyed
our
village
it
called
my
husband
then
and
would
not
answer
him
and
in
two
days
he
was
slain
the
is
never
footnote
a
small
owl
called
or
the
which
the
indians
attach
the
superstition
here
alluded
to
and
believe
if
it
does
not
answer
to
their
whistle
it
denotes
their
speedy
death
mailah
replied
the
young
christian
squaw
not
so
surely
it
is
not
thus
that
the
great
mahneto
calls
his
children
to
come
to
him
once
i
believed
all
these
indian
stories
but
now
i
know
that
they
are
false
and
vain
i
know
that
our
lives
and
all
things
that
befall
us
are
in
the
hands
of
the
wise
and
good
god
the
mahneto
of
the
christians
and
of
the
red
men
too
and
now
i
have
no
fear
of
any
of
those
strange
sounds
that
used
to
make
me
sad
and
terrify
me
with
thoughts
of
coming
evil
i
most
teach
you
to
believe
as
i
do
now
or
rather
my
shall
teach
you
for
he
knows
the
words
of
mahneto
himself
see
mailah
there
my
brother
comes
let
us
go
to
meet
him
a
flush
of
joy
mounted
to
the
clear
olive
cheek
of
oriana
as
she
said
these
words
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
the
lightness
of
a
fawn
mailah
rose
more
gently
and
replacing
her
infant
in
the
pouch
slung
it
over
her
shoulder
and
followed
her
friend
softly
whispering
in
her
ear
white
stranger
is
your
lincoya
the
indian
beauty
smiled
and
blushed
more
deeply
but
she
did
not
bound
across
the
glade
to
meet
henrich
as
she
had
purposed
doing
she
drew
her
slender
figure
to
its
full
height
and
stood
still
and
as
henrich
galloped
across
the
green
meadow
and
alighted
full
of
animation
to
tell
her
of
his
success
in
his
first
essay
at
hunting
the
elk
he
wondered
why
she
greeted
him
so
coldly
the
fact
was
that
oriana
was
beginning
to
find
that
the
stranger
possessed
even
more
interest
in
her
eyes
than
she
had
ever
felt
for
her
own
dark
brother
tekon
and
when
mailah
had
openly
alluded
to
this
sentiment
which
she
thought
unknown
to
all
but
herself
her
natural
and
instinctive
delicacy
was
wounded
but
the
feeling
quickly
wore
away
and
as
henrich
and
jyanough
detailed
the
exciting
sports
of
the
day
she
forgot
all
but
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
his
voice
and
gazing
at
his
fine
countenance
and
bright
sweet
smile
she
was
happy
and
she
though
not
of
the
future
and
henrich
was
happy
too
he
had
now
found
companions
whom
he
could
love
and
the
life
of
the
indian
hunters
was
all
that
he
had
ever
pictured
to
himself
of
freedom
and
adventure
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
the
clearness
of
the
sky
and
the
glow
of
health
and
excitement
that
animated
his
whole
frame
when
he
joined
in
the
chase
with
his
savage
friends
were
all
so
entirely
different
to
the
life
he
had
led
in
damp
and
foggy
holland
that
it
was
no
wonder
he
enjoyed
it
and
that
his
youthful
spirits
enabled
him
to
subdue
the
grief
that
he
felt
at
each
remembrance
of
his
family
and
his
home
hope
was
strong
in
his
breast
and
he
trusted
once
again
to
meet
all
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
and
the
present
was
so
bright
and
inspiring
that
he
could
not
desire
to
change
it
yet
for
many
weeks
the
camp
remained
pitched
in
the
same
lovely
situation
and
the
time
of
the
hunters
was
fully
occupied
in
the
discovery
and
pursuit
of
the
various
wild
animals
that
abounded
in
the
uncultivated
but
richly
verdant
prairie
of
these
the
elk
and
the
buffalo
were
the
most
common
victims
to
the
spears
and
arrows
of
the
indians
and
every
evening
large
quantities
of
meat
were
brought
into
the
camp
and
given
to
the
care
of
the
squaws
to
dry
and
cure
for
winter
consumption
these
larger
animals
were
too
heavy
to
be
transported
whole
to
the
huts
end
therefore
the
hunters
always
skinned
them
and
cut
off
the
flesh
where
they
fell
and
left
the
carcasses
to
the
wolves
and
the
birds
of
prey
that
were
ever
ready
at
hand
but
the
smaller
animals
and
the
wild
turkeys
and
other
birds
that
were
killed
in
great
numbers
were
brought
in
and
thrown
down
by
the
blazing
camp
fires
that
lighted
up
the
glade
every
night
and
were
speedily
prepared
and
cooked
for
the
supper
of
the
hungry
hunters
as
the
leader
of
the
expedition
tisquantum
was
always
presented
with
the
choicest
of
the
game
and
it
was
oriana
task
to
superintend
the
curing
of
the
elk
and
buffalo
meat
and
the
cooking
that
was
required
for
her
father
lodge
in
all
these
household
cares
she
was
greatly
assisted
by
mailah
who
was
both
active
and
skilful
in
all
the
duties
of
an
indian
squaw
and
eager
also
to
evince
her
gratitude
for
the
kindness
and
protection
that
were
afforded
to
herself
and
her
child
by
the
nausett
chief
by
doing
all
that
she
could
to
lighten
labors
time
and
occupation
did
not
fail
to
have
their
usual
effect
on
one
so
young
and
naturally
so
as
mailah
and
animated
cheerfulness
took
the
place
of
the
mournful
expression
that
had
hitherto
so
frequently
sat
on
her
countenance
she
did
not
forget
lincoya
but
she
forgot
the
call
of
the
and
when
she
sang
her
child
to
sleep
it
was
no
longer
with
the
same
sad
cadence
as
at
first
sorrow
could
not
strike
very
deep
or
abide
very
long
in
the
heart
of
a
being
so
gay
and
with
a
mind
and
feelings
so
utterly
uncultivated
as
those
of
the
young
stone
indian
neither
could
she
live
so
much
in
the
society
of
the
white
stranger
and
his
two
chosen
companions
without
imbibing
something
of
their
intelligence
and
becoming
sensible
of
their
superiority
of
mind
to
all
others
with
whom
she
had
ever
associated
and
she
grew
more
and
more
attached
to
them
and
learnt
to
regret
less
the
friends
and
companions
among
whom
her
youth
had
been
spent
she
was
a
and
courageous
creature
she
would
have
followed
her
husband
unhesitatingly
to
death
had
she
been
called
on
to
do
so
or
she
would
have
died
to
save
him
if
her
life
could
have
availed
to
purchase
his
but
now
that
he
was
gone
and
she
could
not
even
weep
over
his
grave
and
deck
it
with
flowers
and
gifts
her
lively
spirit
rose
again
and
led
her
to
seek
amusement
and
occupation
in
everything
within
her
reach
the
accounts
which
henrich
and
jyanough
continually
gave
to
her
and
oriana
of
their
exciting
adventures
in
the
prairie
had
aroused
in
both
of
them
a
strong
desire
to
be
spectators
of
the
sport
and
they
sought
and
obtained
tisquantum
permission
to
accompany
the
hunters
one
morning
to
the
buffalo
ground
that
lay
nearest
to
the
camp
and
there
to
witness
the
pursuit
and
capture
of
some
of
those
magnificent
animals
a
short
ride
through
the
forest
brought
the
party
out
upon
a
vast
and
glorious
prairie
on
which
the
rich
autumnal
sun
was
shining
in
all
his
strength
on
a
rising
ground
that
partially
overlooked
the
plain
oriana
and
her
companion
took
up
their
position
beneath
the
shade
of
a
grove
of
pines
and
they
watched
the
hunters
as
they
examined
the
prints
on
the
dewy
turf
or
followed
the
tracks
of
the
elks
and
buffaloes
through
the
long
in
order
to
make
their
arrangements
for
enclosing
the
game
and
driving
the
animals
into
an
open
and
central
situation
in
the
course
of
this
examination
the
recent
tracks
of
a
number
of
wild
horses
were
discovered
and
fresh
excitement
was
felt
by
the
whole
party
for
all
were
desirous
to
attempt
the
capture
of
these
most
valuable
animals
and
they
resolved
on
this
occasion
to
make
them
the
chief
objects
of
their
pursuit
a
ring
was
therefore
formed
by
the
numerous
company
of
horsemen
enclosing
a
very
large
space
of
the
beautiful
ground
which
was
studded
with
trees
either
single
or
in
groups
while
underneath
them
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
many
buffaloes
lying
down
or
grazing
the
scene
had
the
appearance
of
a
wide
extent
of
pasture
ornamented
with
timber
of
every
kind
end
it
forcibly
recalled
to
henrich
memory
the
fields
and
the
cattle
that
had
surrounded
his
european
home
but
the
size
of
the
trees
the
extent
of
the
natural
meadow
and
above
all
the
wild
aspect
of
the
red
hunters
with
their
spears
and
bows
and
tomahawks
soon
destroyed
the
fancied
resemblance
while
the
eagerness
and
excitement
of
the
novel
sport
banished
all
the
sad
recollections
to
which
it
had
given
rise
a
desire
also
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
presence
of
oriana
and
show
her
that
a
could
equal
her
own
dark
race
in
courage
and
dexterity
inspired
him
with
peculiar
ardor
and
he
galloped
to
the
station
appointed
him
by
tisquantum
with
a
heart
that
bounded
with
pride
and
pleasure
the
hunters
were
each
provided
with
a
long
coil
of
grass
rope
with
a
noose
at
the
end
now
called
a
or
used
by
the
indians
for
casting
over
the
horns
of
the
elks
and
buffaloes
or
the
necks
of
the
wild
horses
that
they
desired
to
capture
these
they
carried
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
ready
to
throw
them
off
in
an
instant
to
their
whole
length
if
necessary
but
much
practice
is
required
to
do
this
with
precision
and
henrich
did
not
yet
hope
for
success
in
the
difficult
art
his
only
chance
of
capturing
a
wild
courser
lay
in
his
skill
in
casting
the
spear
which
might
enable
him
to
pierce
the
animal
through
the
upper
part
of
the
neck
and
thus
produce
a
temporary
insensibility
during
which
time
he
might
be
secured
without
any
permanent
injury
this
also
requires
great
precision
and
address
but
henrich
had
become
an
adept
in
the
use
of
the
light
lance
and
he
felt
sanguine
of
success
if
the
opportunity
should
he
afforded
him
the
string
of
horsemen
slowly
and
warily
drew
in
towards
the
open
spot
that
was
intended
to
be
the
scene
of
their
operations
and
of
which
oriana
and
mailah
had
a
good
view
from
their
safe
and
elevated
position
and
soon
a
troop
of
wild
horses
were
disturbed
by
one
of
the
hunters
and
burst
forth
from
a
thick
grove
of
trees
that
had
previously
concealed
them
they
rushed
madly
over
the
plain
mingling
with
the
affrighted
buffaloes
and
american
deer
that
had
not
hitherto
perceived
the
stealthy
approach
of
their
foes
at
every
point
where
they
attempted
to
escape
from
the
enclosure
they
were
met
by
a
mounted
huntsman
and
were
driven
back
with
shouts
and
cries
towards
the
center
all
other
game
was
now
forgotten
and
each
hunter
singled
out
for
his
own
object
of
pursuit
the
steed
that
pleased
him
best
and
of
which
he
thought
he
could
most
easily
gain
possession
but
one
there
was
the
leader
of
the
troop
on
which
many
eyes
were
fixed
with
eager
desire
he
was
a
noble
creature
of
perfect
form
and
proportions
and
as
he
pranced
before
his
companions
with
neck
erect
and
throwing
his
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
to
reconnoiter
his
assailants
while
his
mane
and
tail
floated
in
the
breeze
and
his
glossy
skin
gave
back
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
he
looked
like
the
king
of
the
prairie
going
forth
in
the
pride
of
perfect
freedom
the
ring
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
every
hand
was
steady
and
every
eye
was
fixed
for
the
moment
of
trial
and
soon
the
headlong
pursuit
commenced
at
the
first
scattering
of
the
wild
troop
several
of
the
younger
and
more
feeble
horses
were
secured
and
some
of
the
hunters
who
despaired
of
nobler
game
contented
themselves
with
capturing
or
slaying
either
elks
or
buffaloes
but
the
finest
horses
escaped
the
first
assault
and
broke
through
the
circling
ring
into
the
boundless
meadow
where
they
were
followed
at
mad
speed
by
the
hunters
poising
their
spears
and
swinging
their
nooses
round
their
heads
ready
for
a
cast
henrich
and
jyanough
and
several
others
of
the
best
mounted
indians
had
joined
in
the
chase
of
the
black
leader
and
dashed
furiously
after
him
over
the
plain
the
horse
that
the
english
boy
rode
was
strong
and
fleet
and
the
light
weight
of
his
rider
enabled
him
to
keep
with
the
foremost
of
the
red
hunters
steeds
and
at
length
to
come
almost
alongside
the
noble
courser
the
spear
was
poised
in
henrich
hand
and
was
just
about
to
fly
when
suddenly
his
horse
fell
to
the
ground
and
rolled
over
on
the
turf
leaving
his
rider
prostrate
but
uninjured
except
being
stunned
for
a
moment
by
the
shock
when
he
opened
his
eyes
and
sprang
to
his
feet
he
saw
the
king
of
the
desert
galloping
up
a
rising
ground
over
which
he
quickly
disappeared
still
hotly
pursued
by
coubitant
and
several
of
the
hunters
jyanough
and
the
rest
of
his
companions
had
dismounted
to
assist
their
fallen
friend
and
to
form
conjectures
as
to
the
probable
cause
of
the
unlucky
accident
for
some
time
none
could
be
perceived
but
on
carefully
examining
his
horse
henrich
at
length
discovered
a
small
wound
in
the
hind
leg
and
found
that
the
creature
was
lame
how
or
by
whom
the
wound
had
been
given
he
could
not
even
surmise
for
in
the
eagerness
of
the
chase
he
had
not
observed
that
coubitant
rode
close
behind
him
and
that
he
had
passed
him
at
full
speed
the
moment
his
horse
stumbled
and
fell
but
jyanough
had
remarked
it
and
from
what
he
had
already
seen
of
the
wily
indian
he
felt
convinced
that
prompted
by
malicious
jealousy
he
had
thus
sought
to
deprive
his
rival
of
his
success
and
perhaps
even
to
inflict
on
him
some
grievous
personal
injury
the
young
indian
had
however
the
good
sense
to
conceal
his
suspicions
from
henrich
at
present
and
to
allow
him
to
regard
the
whole
affair
as
accidental
but
he
determined
to
keep
a
strict
watch
over
the
conduct
of
coubitant
for
the
future
and
if
possible
to
guard
his
friend
from
all
his
evil
machinations
soon
the
nausett
and
the
rest
of
the
hunters
returned
from
their
fruitless
chase
and
reported
the
escape
of
the
noble
wild
coursers
and
when
jyanough
heard
the
regrets
that
coubitant
expressed
for
the
accident
that
had
befallen
henrich
and
the
condolences
he
offered
on
his
having
thus
missed
the
object
which
otherwise
his
skill
most
surely
have
attained
he
could
scarcely
contain
his
indignation
at
such
hypocrisy
or
refrain
from
opening
the
eyes
of
the
unsuspicious
young
englishman
they
all
returned
together
at
a
slow
pace
to
the
main
body
of
the
hunters
for
henrich
horse
was
too
lame
to
be
mounted
and
as
soon
as
the
adventure
was
made
known
much
sympathy
and
interest
were
shown
for
the
disappointment
of
the
in
which
oriana
countenance
and
manner
showed
she
partook
so
warmly
that
coubitant
turned
aside
to
conceal
his
anger
and
vexation
and
heartily
wished
that
his
blow
had
not
only
deprived
henrich
of
the
glory
of
that
day
hunting
but
had
also
put
a
stop
for
ever
to
the
success
for
which
he
both
hated
and
envied
him
the
sport
continued
after
this
interruption
as
actively
as
before
but
neither
henrich
nor
his
horse
could
take
any
further
share
in
it
and
he
remained
with
oriana
and
mailah
enjoying
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
and
gathering
flowers
and
fruit
for
his
companions
and
for
the
little
lincoya
who
freed
from
the
restraint
of
his
bed
now
rolled
on
the
turf
with
rodolph
and
played
with
the
gentle
and
intelligent
animal
how
happy
was
oriana
that
day
she
was
proud
of
the
gallant
bearing
of
her
brother
among
the
red
warriors
of
her
own
wild
race
and
she
had
exulted
at
the
praises
which
she
had
heard
bestowed
on
his
address
as
a
hunter
and
his
shill
in
horsemanship
by
tisquantum
and
the
elder
indians
and
now
though
she
regretted
his
accident
and
the
disappointment
which
it
had
caused
him
she
did
not
suspect
that
it
had
been
effected
by
the
malice
of
a
deadly
enemy
and
she
rejoiced
that
it
had
given
her
the
pleasure
of
his
society
for
the
rest
of
the
day
a
pleasure
which
she
had
but
seldom
enjoyed
since
their
arrival
in
the
prairie
at
the
close
of
the
day
the
game
was
collected
and
after
due
preparation
was
carried
back
to
the
camp
where
the
squaws
had
already
lighted
the
evening
fires
and
made
every
necessary
arrangement
for
cooking
the
expected
supper
around
these
fires
the
hunters
sat
in
groups
and
discussed
the
events
of
the
day
among
which
the
accident
that
had
befallen
the
excited
much
interest
and
conjecture
jyanough
listened
to
the
probable
and
improbable
causes
that
were
assigned
by
all
the
speakers
especially
by
coubitant
to
account
for
so
strange
a
circumstance
but
he
held
his
peace
for
in
his
inmost
soul
he
was
only
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
subtle
and
brewed
savage
was
the
perpetrator
of
the
malicious
deed
in
this
suspicion
he
was
the
more
strongly
confirmed
by
an
event
that
occurred
a
few
days
afterwards
it
had
been
discovered
that
the
stream
that
ran
so
gently
by
the
side
of
the
encampment
fell
at
some
distance
to
the
west
into
a
river
of
considerable
size
and
depth
which
then
ran
on
over
a
descending
and
rocky
bed
forming
alternately
smooth
broad
sheets
of
water
and
noisy
broken
falls
until
it
precipitated
itself
over
a
sudden
precipice
of
great
depth
and
fell
dashing
and
foaming
into
the
basin
which
its
continual
fall
had
worn
in
the
rocks
below
the
distant
roar
of
this
cataract
had
frequently
been
heard
in
the
camp
when
the
wind
came
from
that
direction
and
when
the
stillness
of
the
night
broken
only
by
the
occasional
howl
of
wild
beasts
seeking
their
prey
or
the
melancholy
cry
of
the
succeeded
to
the
sounds
of
labor
or
idleness
that
generally
kept
the
temporary
village
alive
by
day
but
hitherto
no
one
had
had
leisure
or
inclination
to
leave
the
excitement
and
novelty
of
hunting
to
explore
the
river
or
ascertain
its
capabilities
for
fishing
footnote
this
mournful
sound
is
believed
by
the
indians
to
be
the
moaning
of
the
departed
spirits
of
women
who
have
committed
infanticide
and
who
are
consequently
excluded
by
mahneto
from
the
happy
mountains
which
are
the
abode
of
the
blessed
now
however
coubitant
brought
in
a
report
one
evening
that
the
great
stream
abounded
in
fish
and
proposed
in
to
henrich
that
as
he
was
for
the
present
unable
to
join
in
the
more
active
business
of
the
chase
he
should
assist
him
in
forming
a
light
canoe
in
which
they
could
go
out
and
spear
the
game
that
lay
beneath
the
clear
blue
water
in
the
smooth
reaches
of
the
river
to
this
proposal
henrich
readily
assented
for
the
sport
was
one
of
which
he
had
beard
his
indian
friends
speak
with
great
pleasure
and
he
greatly
wished
to
enjoy
it
the
canoe
was
immediately
commenced
and
as
it
merely
consisted
of
the
trunk
of
a
straight
hollowed
out
by
means
of
fire
and
shaped
with
a
hatchet
it
was
completed
in
a
couple
of
days
the
light
spears
that
were
to
pierce
the
fish
were
prepared
and
long
slender
lines
of
twisted
grass
were
fastened
to
their
shafts
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
in
their
prey
and
the
following
morning
when
the
hunters
were
ready
to
set
out
on
their
usual
expedition
coubitant
desired
henrich
to
accompany
him
to
the
river
side
where
their
little
bark
lay
ready
to
receive
them
why
on
hearing
this
proposal
did
jyanough
still
linger
when
all
the
rest
of
the
hunters
were
mounted
and
his
own
steed
was
pawing
the
ground
impatient
of
his
delay
and
why
after
gazing
a
few
moments
at
coubitant
dark
countenance
did
he
declare
his
wish
to
join
the
fishing
party
and
requested
the
nausett
to
allow
him
to
take
a
place
in
the
canoe
did
he
see
treachery
in
that
eye
of
fire
jyanough
could
lend
his
horse
to
the
if
he
should
happen
to
wish
to
hunt
his
request
was
however
negatived
decidedly
by
coubitant
who
assured
him
with
assumed
courtesy
that
he
regretted
the
size
of
the
boat
was
too
small
to
admit
of
its
carrying
a
third
sportsman
with
safety
but
invited
him
to
join
him
in
the
same
sport
the
following
day
when
he
added
with
that
smile
that
oriana
hated
jyanough
could
lend
his
horse
to
the
if
he
should
happen
to
wish
to
hunt
the
young
cree
was
baffled
he
would
gladly
have
pre
vented
his
friend
from
accompanying
coubitant
on
the
expedition
but
be
had
no
means
of
doing
so
or
even
of
putting
him
on
his
guard
against
any
possible
evil
designs
on
the
part
of
his
companion
so
he
sprang
upon
his
eager
horse
and
galloped
after
the
hunters
hoping
that
his
fears
and
suspicions
were
unfounded
oriana
and
mailah
attended
by
their
faithful
companion
rodolph
walked
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
to
see
the
fishermen
embark
in
their
frail
vessel
and
for
some
time
they
watched
the
sport
with
considerable
interest
and
admired
the
skill
with
which
coubitant
pierced
and
brought
up
several
large
fish
these
he
attracted
towards
the
canoe
by
means
of
some
preparation
that
he
scattered
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
when
the
fish
appeared
within
reach
of
his
spear
he
darted
it
with
unerring
aim
and
drew
in
his
struggling
victim
with
the
line
that
was
attached
to
it
henrich
was
also
provided
with
weapons
but
as
the
sport
was
entirely
new
to
him
he
found
it
difficult
to
take
a
steady
aim
and
his
success
was
slight
coubitant
however
had
soon
secured
a
considerable
stock
of
fish
and
he
rowed
to
the
shore
and
requested
oriana
and
her
companion
to
convey
them
to
the
sachem
lodge
adding
in
a
careless
tone
that
it
would
not
be
worth
their
while
to
return
to
the
river
as
he
was
going
to
a
reach
at
some
distance
down
the
stream
towards
the
head
of
the
cataract
where
he
expected
to
show
henrich
excellent
sport
the
two
young
women
returned
to
the
camp
and
having
committed
the
fine
fish
to
the
care
of
the
inferior
squaws
they
agreed
to
go
again
towards
the
river
and
take
this
opportunity
of
visiting
the
falls
which
they
much
desired
to
see
and
near
which
they
should
probably
again
meet
the
fishermen
they
rambled
through
the
wood
taking
a
direct
course
towards
the
cataract
the
sound
of
whose
waters
soon
became
sufficiently
audible
to
guide
them
in
their
unknown
way
sometimes
they
came
in
sight
of
the
river
and
again
they
saw
the
little
canoe
either
standing
motionless
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
water
where
the
stream
was
wide
and
unbroken
or
else
passing
under
the
skilful
guidance
of
coubitant
between
the
rocks
that
occasionally
disturbed
its
course
and
formed
foaming
rapids
down
which
the
little
bark
darted
with
fearful
velocity
the
last
reach
of
the
broad
river
was
as
calm
and
smooth
as
a
lake
it
seemed
as
if
the
collected
mass
of
water
which
had
gathered
there
from
many
a
broken
and
troubled
stream
and
had
struggled
through
many
windings
and
many
difficulties
was
reposing
there
and
gaining
strength
for
its
last
great
leap
over
the
dark
precipice
as
oriana
and
mailah
approached
the
verge
of
the
scattered
forest
and
stood
to
gaze
on
the
magnificent
scene
before
them
they
perceived
the
canoe
descend
a
narrow
rapid
and
then
take
up
a
position
below
an
elevated
mass
of
rock
where
the
water
was
perfectly
still
and
where
the
fishermen
could
quietly
pursue
their
occupation
they
evidently
did
not
perceive
their
female
friends
and
the
roar
of
the
cataract
was
now
so
loud
as
to
prevent
all
possibility
of
their
hearing
their
voices
for
a
short
time
oriana
and
her
friend
watched
their
movements
and
saw
several
fish
captured
and
then
proceeded
along
the
steep
and
rocky
bank
in
order
to
obtain
a
still
better
view
of
the
waterfall
it
was
a
beautiful
scene
on
which
those
two
young
indians
looked
and
they
felt
its
power
and
grandeur
and
stood
silent
and
motionless
the
cataract
was
beneath
them
and
its
roar
came
up
like
thunder
from
the
dark
deep
basin
into
which
its
weight
of
waters
fell
and
threw
up
a
cloud
of
foam
and
spray
and
then
it
rushed
away
again
as
if
in
gladness
at
its
safe
descent
and
free
course
until
the
shining
stream
was
hidden
by
the
rocks
and
overhanging
trees
that
marked
its
winding
course
the
natural
platform
on
which
oriana
and
mailah
stood
commanded
a
view
not
only
of
the
wild
cataract
and
the
lower
stretch
of
the
river
but
also
of
the
bold
steep
rocks
on
the
opposite
side
and
the
dark
forest
that
stretched
away
to
the
distant
mountains
that
bounded
the
horizon
it
likewise
enabled
them
to
perceive
the
small
canoe
lying
motionless
on
the
water
in
the
shadow
of
the
projecting
rock
by
and
by
the
boat
was
rowed
into
the
center
of
the
river
and
coubitant
appeared
to
be
seeking
for
a
good
fishing
spot
as
he
pointed
in
different
directions
and
once
or
twice
darted
his
spear
into
the
water
and
drew
it
out
again
without
any
success
meanwhile
the
canoe
floated
slowly
down
the
stream
but
its
motion
gradually
increased
as
it
approached
the
fall
and
oriana
gazed
at
it
expecting
every
moment
that
coubitant
who
had
now
taken
the
oar
in
his
powerful
grasp
would
turn
its
course
and
either
draw
towards
the
shore
or
else
row
back
again
up
the
river
and
land
below
the
first
rapids
to
her
surprise
and
somewhat
to
her
anxiety
he
still
continued
however
to
allow
the
canoe
to
proceed
and
she
saw
henrich
take
a
dart
in
his
hand
and
stand
erect
as
if
to
strike
at
something
beneath
the
surface
to
which
coubitant
pointed
with
the
paddle
another
instant
and
her
white
brother
was
in
the
water
and
struggling
to
catch
the
side
of
the
canoe
breathlessly
she
gazed
and
she
distinctly
saw
the
paddle
which
coubitant
held
extended
towards
the
uplifted
hand
of
henrich
still
he
did
not
grasp
it
o
why
was
this
and
then
the
boat
which
bad
already
floated
perilously
near
to
the
fall
was
suddenly
turned
and
she
beheld
coubitant
making
violent
efforts
to
overcome
the
force
of
the
current
and
row
to
the
opposite
and
nearest
shore
he
was
alone
and
where
was
henrich
where
was
the
brave
young
stranger
battling
desperately
with
the
rapid
stream
which
was
carrying
him
onward
to
destruction
he
rose
and
sank
rose
again
and
the
current
bore
him
on
with
resistless
force
for
a
moment
oriana
clasped
her
hands
over
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
dreadful
sight
and
then
as
if
inspired
by
a
gleam
of
supernatural
hope
she
darted
forward
calling
rodolph
and
pointing
to
the
stream
the
intelligent
creature
had
seen
the
form
of
henrich
in
the
water
and
only
waited
his
mistress
command
to
risk
his
life
in
the
attempt
to
save
him
but
his
sagacity
taught
him
that
it
was
useless
to
enter
the
river
above
the
fall
and
he
bounded
down
the
steep
bank
that
led
to
its
foot
and
stood
eager
and
panting
on
a
point
of
rock
that
overhung
the
basin
oriana
was
quickly
on
the
same
spot
followed
by
mailah
but
ere
they
reached
it
the
dog
had
plunged
into
the
foaming
waters
and
now
appeared
upholding
the
inanimate
form
of
henrich
and
struggling
fearfully
to
drag
him
from
the
whirlpool
o
it
was
a
sickening
sight
and
oriana
heart
stood
still
in
the
agony
of
suspense
she
could
not
aid
her
brother
she
could
not
cope
with
that
mad
whirl
of
water
but
she
leaped
down
the
steep
rocks
and
stood
on
the
narrow
ledge
of
shore
below
to
wait
the
moment
for
action
at
length
after
what
appeared
almost
a
hopeless
conflict
with
the
dashing
waters
rodolph
appeared
through
the
cloud
of
foam
and
slowly
and
feebly
swam
towards
the
shore
still
supporting
the
lifeless
burden
that
seemed
almost
to
drag
him
beneath
the
surface
now
was
the
time
for
the
indian
girl
to
prove
her
skill
and
courage
lightly
she
sprang
into
the
water
and
in
a
moment
she
was
at
side
and
with
one
arm
sustaining
the
drooping
head
of
henrich
while
with
the
other
she
dexterously
swam
back
to
the
spot
where
mailah
stood
ready
to
assist
her
with
much
difficulty
they
lifted
the
senseless
form
of
henrich
on
the
shore
and
proceeded
to
adopt
every
means
in
their
power
to
restore
suspended
animation
while
rodolph
the
faithful
devoted
rodolph
lay
down
panting
and
exhausted
but
still
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
him
whom
he
had
so
daringly
rescued
long
the
two
young
indians
labored
in
silence
and
almost
in
despair
for
no
color
returned
to
those
pallid
lips
and
no
warmth
was
perceptible
in
the
chilled
and
stiffened
hands
that
fell
powerless
by
his
side
still
they
persevered
and
no
tear
no
lamentation
betrayed
the
anguish
that
wrung
the
heart
of
oriana
while
she
believed
that
all
was
in
vain
but
her
soul
was
lifted
up
in
prayer
to
the
one
true
god
in
whom
she
had
been
taught
to
put
her
trust
by
her
beloved
and
in
his
mercy
was
her
only
hope
nor
was
that
hope
in
vain
the
warm
beams
of
the
sun
fell
powerfully
on
that
sheltered
spot
where
the
little
group
were
gathered
and
combined
with
the
continued
friction
that
oriana
and
mailah
employed
at
length
brought
back
the
to
henrich
cheeks
and
lips
and
his
anxious
nurses
had
the
joy
of
perceiving
that
he
breathed
a
few
minutes
more
and
he
opened
his
deep
blue
eyes
and
looked
wildly
around
him
and
spoke
some
english
words
that
oriana
heard
amid
the
din
of
the
falling
waters
and
knew
were
of
his
home
and
his
kindred
and
then
he
uttered
her
own
name
and
attempted
to
rise
but
fell
back
again
into
her
arms
and
smiled
sweetly
and
gratefully
when
her
eyes
met
his
and
he
saw
that
she
was
watching
over
him
there
was
joy
deep
joy
and
gratitude
in
those
young
hearts
at
that
moment
but
henrich
weakness
and
the
noise
of
the
roaring
cataract
prevented
them
from
communicating
their
feelings
in
words
and
oriana
forbore
to
ask
any
questions
of
henrich
relative
to
the
cause
of
his
perilous
adventure
after
some
time
he
seemed
greatly
to
recover
and
rising
from
the
ground
he
slowly
mounted
the
bank
supported
by
oriana
and
her
friend
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
proceed
on
foot
to
the
camp
and
it
was
agreed
that
mailah
should
return
as
quickly
as
possible
and
bring
such
assistance
as
she
could
procure
from
thence
while
henrich
and
oriana
should
advance
as
far
as
his
enfeebled
state
would
admit
of
mailah
light
form
soon
disappeared
in
the
wood
and
it
was
not
long
ere
she
reached
the
camp
and
hastened
to
the
tent
of
tisquantum
who
on
that
day
had
not
joined
the
hunting
party
she
told
her
story
in
which
the
old
chief
showed
the
deepest
interest
and
she
observed
a
dark
frown
on
his
brow
while
she
related
the
unsuccessful
attempts
of
coubitant
to
draw
henrich
from
the
water
with
his
paddle
but
he
made
no
remark
the
hunters
were
still
absent
and
few
men
remained
in
the
camp
these
were
all
engaged
in
felling
wood
and
other
laborious
employments
and
tisquantum
prepared
to
lead
his
own
horse
out
to
meet
his
adopted
son
but
just
as
he
and
mailah
were
leaving
the
camp
for
this
purpose
coubitant
came
rapidly
up
from
the
river
brink
and
hurrying
towards
them
began
to
relate
with
expressions
of
grief
and
consternation
the
sad
fate
which
he
believed
to
have
befallen
the
young
stranger
and
the
exertions
that
he
had
made
to
save
his
life
but
which
had
unhappily
proved
unavailing
to
avert
the
calamity
the
sorrow
of
the
nausett
indian
seemed
excessive
and
tisquantum
probably
considered
it
so
for
he
listened
with
perfect
calmness
to
his
recital
and
then
merely
replied
the
youth
is
safe
mahneto
has
succored
him
and
i
go
to
bring
him
back
to
the
camp
coubitant
started
and
he
looked
embarrassed
for
a
moment
when
he
caught
the
penetrating
eye
of
mailah
fixed
on
his
countenance
but
he
quickly
recovered
his
and
manifested
such
joy
at
the
escape
of
the
white
stranger
from
a
watery
grave
that
mailah
almost
chid
herself
for
her
dreadful
suspicions
coubitant
accompanied
her
and
the
sachem
on
their
way
through
the
forest
and
when
they
met
henrich
and
oriana
he
again
assumed
such
an
appearance
of
pleasure
and
so
warmly
congratulated
the
former
on
his
miraculous
deliverance
that
the
generous
english
youth
strove
to
banish
from
his
mind
the
fearful
thoughts
that
had
arisen
there
while
he
struggled
for
life
close
to
the
canoe
and
wondered
at
the
want
of
skill
and
strength
displayed
by
his
companion
in
his
abortive
attempts
to
save
him
oriana
coldly
received
his
greeting
she
had
long
suspected
that
he
regarded
henrich
with
hatred
and
jealousy
and
her
worst
suspicions
had
that
day
received
a
strong
confirmation
still
she
resolved
to
conceal
them
at
least
at
present
from
all
but
jyanough
whose
friendship
for
henrich
would
she
knew
render
him
peculiarly
alive
to
all
that
concerned
his
safety
she
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
hunters
soon
returned
and
she
observed
that
when
jyanough
heard
the
story
of
the
day
adventure
he
cast
a
glance
on
coubitant
that
made
the
conscious
savage
quail
but
when
she
related
to
the
young
cree
all
that
she
and
mailah
had
observed
he
could
restrain
his
feelings
no
longer
and
plainly
told
her
that
he
was
convinced
that
coubitant
was
the
author
of
the
calamity
and
that
it
was
not
the
first
attempt
he
had
made
at
henrich
life
they
resolved
that
he
should
communicate
all
his
suspicions
to
the
sachem
the
following
morning
and
urge
him
to
take
measures
for
the
safety
of
his
adopted
son
but
what
was
jyanough
surprise
when
he
opened
the
subject
to
tisquantum
at
being
informed
that
coubitant
had
already
left
the
camp
with
the
pequodees
jyanough
knew
that
it
was
their
intention
that
morning
at
to
set
off
on
their
return
to
their
own
woods
and
plains
and
he
found
that
the
wily
nausett
had
expressed
a
desire
to
accompany
them
and
join
in
the
war
that
was
going
on
between
their
tribe
and
some
of
their
neighbors
in
order
to
distinguish
himself
as
a
warrior
it
was
not
the
sachem
intention
to
rejoin
his
tribe
for
a
considerable
time
he
was
fond
of
wandering
and
proposed
to
travel
towards
the
north
when
the
hunting
season
should
be
over
and
he
also
felt
a
reluctance
to
take
his
now
greatly
beloved
captive
back
to
that
part
of
the
country
where
it
was
possible
he
might
gain
intelligence
of
his
friends
or
perhaps
even
make
his
escape
to
them
he
had
therefore
consented
to
coubitant
request
and
evidently
felt
an
undefined
satisfaction
in
his
absence
this
being
the
case
and
the
departure
of
coubitant
having
removed
all
present
danger
to
henrich
from
his
malicious
schemes
jyanough
forbore
to
express
all
he
felt
to
the
old
sachem
and
he
returned
to
oriana
with
the
pleasant
intelligence
that
the
enemy
of
her
white
brother
had
departed
to
the
young
this
news
imparted
infinite
relief
and
even
henrich
could
not
regret
it
although
he
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
all
the
suspicions
of
his
friends
were
still
the
events
of
the
preceding
day
were
quite
sufficient
to
make
him
doubt
more
than
ever
the
sincerity
of
coubitant
professed
regard
and
he
felt
that
he
should
be
happier
now
that
the
savage
was
gone
to
his
pleasant
life
of
freedom
we
will
now
leave
him
and
return
to
new
plymouth
where
many
events
deeply
interesting
to
the
settlers
had
occurred
since
his
involuntary
departure
and
supposed
death

passed
along
the
scattered
village
of
log
huts
which
was
their
home
in
their
voluntary
exile
and
wound
up
the
pathway
that
led
towards
the
summit
of
the
mount
afterwards
called
burying
hill
on
which
they
had
constructed
a
rude
fort
or
storehouse
and
whither
they
were
now
bearing
to
his
last
earthly
home
the
chief
and
the
most
respected
of
their
community
the
governor
carver
he
who
had
presided
over
their
councils
and
directed
all
their
movements
since
the
memorable
day
of
their
landing
and
had
been
the
friend
the
physician
the
comforter
of
his
little
flock
through
all
their
trials
and
all
their
sufferings
had
fallen
a
victim
to
disease
and
just
as
spring
with
all
its
brighter
hopes
for
the
future
had
set
in
it
was
but
a
few
days
after
henrich
capture
that
this
heavy
affliction
befell
the
colony
and
added
greatly
to
the
gloom
which
the
loss
of
young
maitland
had
already
cast
over
the
whole
village
the
departure
also
of
the
vessel
in
which
the
pilgrims
had
come
out
to
america
occurred
at
the
same
time
and
although
not
one
of
the
exiles
desired
to
return
to
the
land
of
their
birth
and
to
abandon
the
enterprise
on
which
they
had
entered
so
devotedly
yet
it
was
a
melancholy
hour
when
they
bade
adieu
to
the
captain
and
his
crew
and
saw
the
mayflower
sail
away
towards
their
still
country
the
scurvy
and
other
with
the
hardships
and
privations
to
which
they
had
been
exposed
during
the
winter
and
early
spring
had
fearfully
reduced
the
number
of
the
ship
company
and
of
those
who
remained
the
greater
part
were
weakened
by
illness
and
dispirited
by
the
loss
of
so
many
of
their
brave
comrades
whose
graves
they
had
dug
on
the
bleak
shores
of
new
england
the
return
of
spring
and
the
supply
of
provisions
that
the
settlers
were
able
to
obtain
from
the
friendly
indians
had
checked
the
progress
of
the
fatal
complaints
that
had
so
fearfully
ravaged
the
colony
during
the
severity
of
winter
and
had
restored
the
survivors
of
the
ship
crew
to
comparative
health
and
strength
the
captain
was
therefore
glad
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
abandoning
a
shore
which
had
presented
to
him
so
cheerless
and
melancholy
an
aspect
and
of
leaving
the
steadfast
and
devoted
exiles
to
the
fate
which
they
had
chosen
and
which
they
were
resolved
to
abide
in
faith
and
hope
on
the
very
day
that
the
mayflower
set
sail
and
while
its
white
sails
could
still
be
distinguished
in
the
eastern
horizon
the
governor
who
took
an
active
part
in
every
occupation
and
even
every
labor
that
engaged
the
settlers
was
busily
employed
in
sowing
corn
in
the
fields
that
were
considered
as
the
common
property
of
the
colony
in
directing
and
superintending
this
work
he
was
greatly
assisted
by
the
skill
and
experience
of
squanto
the
native
who
as
we
have
already
related
had
been
so
treacherously
carried
off
to
england
by
hunt
and
had
on
his
return
to
america
sought
out
and
attached
himself
to
the
settlers
by
them
he
was
greatly
regarded
and
his
knowledge
of
the
english
language
rendered
his
services
of
inestimable
value
in
all
their
intercourse
with
the
indian
tribes
while
his
acquaintance
with
the
soil
on
which
they
had
established
themselves
and
the
native
modes
of
cultivating
grain
and
other
vegetable
produce
was
of
the
greatest
use
to
men
who
were
only
accustomed
to
european
agriculture
the
maize
and
other
grain
were
sown
in
the
fields
that
had
been
richly
manured
with
fish
to
ensure
an
abundant
crop
and
the
laborers
returned
in
a
body
to
the
village
led
by
their
venerable
and
respected
president
but
no
sooner
had
carver
his
dwelling
than
he
swooned
away
and
never
recovered
his
consciousness
in
a
few
days
he
breathed
his
last
to
the
unutterable
grief
of
his
widow
and
the
deep
regret
of
all
the
settlers
whose
love
and
confidence
he
had
won
during
his
brief
government
by
his
wisdom
and
his
universal
kindness
footnote
it
was
the
custom
of
the
indians
to
manure
their
fields
with
or
a
small
fish
that
comes
up
the
rivers
in
vast
numbers
at
the
spawning
season
about
a
thousand
fish
were
used
for
every
acre
of
land
and
a
single
alleze
was
usually
put
into
every
when
they
buried
their
grain
for
winter
consumption
probably
as
a
charm
to
keep
off
the
evil
demons
and
hostile
wandering
spirits
as
his
funeral
procession
wound
up
the
hill
tears
might
be
seen
on
the
cheek
of
many
a
sturdy
pilgrim
and
sobs
and
lamentations
broke
forth
from
the
women
and
children
after
his
remains
were
laid
in
their
a
fervent
prayer
was
offered
up
by
brewster
whose
age
and
character
caused
him
to
be
regarded
as
the
pastor
of
the
colony
although
he
had
never
been
called
to
the
ministry
after
the
custom
of
the
puritans
and
then
a
hymn
was
sung
by
the
united
voices
of
the
whole
congregation
when
this
simple
ceremony
was
over
and
the
grave
of
the
departed
president
was
closed
and
laid
level
with
the
surrounding
ground
in
order
to
conceal
it
from
the
prowling
indians
the
assembly
repaired
to
the
fort
or
that
stood
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
which
also
served
the
purpose
of
a
or
chapel
its
rude
end
unadorned
simplicity
suited
the
peculiar
ideas
of
the
puritans
who
in
their
zeal
to
escape
from
the
elaborate
ornaments
and
pompous
ceremonial
employed
by
the
papists
had
rushed
into
the
opposite
extreme
and
desired
that
both
their
place
of
worship
and
their
mode
of
performing
it
should
be
divested
of
every
external
decoration
and
every
prescribed
form
the
more
their
place
of
meeting
for
prayer
resembled
an
ordinary
habitation
the
better
they
considered
it
suited
to
the
sacred
purpose
and
they
were
therefore
perfectly
satisfied
to
possess
no
other
church
than
the
rude
fort
built
of
logs
and
posts
and
used
indifferently
as
a
granary
for
the
public
stores
and
as
a
fortress
for
the
defense
of
the
colony
from
any
incursions
of
the
hostile
tribes
in
this
primitive
chapel
brewster
was
accustomed
to
lead
the
devotions
of
the
pilgrims
and
their
families
every
day
morning
and
afternoon
and
also
on
any
other
occasion
of
their
assembling
together
but
as
they
were
in
continual
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
the
venerated
john
robinson
to
resume
his
office
of
regular
pastor
of
the
flock
they
had
not
taken
any
measures
to
gratify
their
ardent
desire
of
hearing
the
three
times
en
every
day
from
some
holy
man
entirely
devoted
to
the
service
of
god
the
addresses
occasionally
delivered
to
the
congregation
by
brewster
or
by
any
other
of
the
ruling
elders
who
might
preside
at
a
meeting
were
called
not
sermons
and
the
interpretation
of
certain
portions
of
scripture
which
was
sometimes
undertaken
by
any
member
of
the
congregation
who
felt
equal
to
it
was
called
these
were
the
only
modes
of
spiritual
instruction
employed
by
the
first
settlers
until
they
procured
clergymen
from
england
or
appointed
ministers
from
among
their
own
elders
and
these
means
were
highly
valued
by
the
settlers
who
had
abandoned
home
and
kindred
and
the
comforts
of
civilized
life
for
no
other
motive
than
to
secure
to
themselves
the
privilege
of
worshipping
god
according
to
their
own
ideas
of
what
was
good
and
profitable
to
their
souls
the
talents
and
the
elevated
piety
of
william
brewster
rendered
him
both
a
very
valuable
teacher
and
also
in
the
eyes
of
the
puritans
an
efficient
substitute
for
their
expected
pastor
footnote
the
puritans
never
used
the
names
or
they
objected
is
the
first
as
savoring
of
paganism
and
to
the
second
as
pertaining
to
judaism
and
yet
they
enforced
the
observance
of
the
day
of
rest
with
almost
mosaic
strictness
on
the
present
mournful
occasion
he
addressed
the
congregation
in
a
very
impressive
manner
on
the
heavy
loss
they
had
sustained
in
the
death
of
their
valued
president
and
exhorted
them
to
remember
and
to
imitate
his
piety
his
charity
and
his
exemplary
patience
and
denial
under
the
trying
circumstances
that
had
marked
the
period
of
his
brief
government
these
circumstances
had
become
less
painful
it
is
true
since
their
friendly
intercourse
with
the
wampanoges
and
the
genial
change
in
the
weather
but
still
the
trials
of
the
pilgrims
were
by
no
means
over
and
their
need
of
faith
in
the
good
providence
of
god
and
of
persevering
resolution
in
the
path
which
they
had
chosen
for
themselves
remained
as
great
as
ever
deeply
was
the
less
of
their
first
president
felt
by
the
colony
for
every
individual
mourned
him
as
a
private
friend
as
well
as
a
wise
end
benevolent
ruler
but
the
blow
fell
with
more
crushing
power
on
her
who
had
shared
his
checkered
life
of
joy
and
sorrow
for
many
years
in
europe
and
had
accompanied
him
into
exile
with
the
devoted
feeling
that
his
presence
would
make
the
wilderness
a
home
his
sudden
removal
and
the
cheerless
blank
that
succeeded
were
more
than
the
strength
of
his
afflicted
widow
could
endure
and
in
six
weeks
she
followed
him
the
grave
from
that
time
it
appeared
as
if
the
severity
of
the
scourge
that
had
ravaged
the
infant
settlement
was
exhausted
for
scarcely
any
more
deaths
occurred
during
that
year
and
many
who
had
hitherto
suffered
from
the
effects
of
disease
regained
their
usual
strength
and
lived
to
a
remarkably
advanced
age
william
bradford
was
the
individual
selected
by
the
community
to
fill
the
arduous
and
responsible
office
that
had
been
held
so
few
months
by
carver
and
the
choice
was
a
most
judicious
one
for
he
was
a
man
well
suited
to
be
the
leader
of
a
colony
exposed
to
the
peculiar
difficulties
that
surrounded
the
puritan
exiles
his
uncommon
sagacity
and
penetration
of
character
and
his
undaunted
resolution
in
times
of
danger
caused
him
to
be
regarded
as
the
very
prop
and
support
of
the
settlement
and
his
worth
was
so
generally
acknowledged
and
so
highly
appreciated
that
he
continued
to
be
annually
elected
governor
for
twelve
succeeding
years
and
never
did
he
disappoint
the
confidence
thus
reposed
in
him
his
treatment
of
the
indians
was
one
point
on
which
he
showed
both
the
correctness
of
his
judgement
and
the
right
feelings
of
his
heart
he
ever
acted
towards
them
with
true
christian
benevolence
and
equity
and
at
the
same
he
preserved
that
authority
and
superiority
over
them
which
were
necessary
to
the
safety
and
being
of
the
colony
and
he
also
carefully
kept
from
them
those
european
weapons
the
possession
of
which
might
render
them
dangerous
to
the
settlers
and
aggravate
the
frequent
hostilities
among
their
own
rival
tribes
unhappily
a
different
course
was
afterwards
pursued
by
the
leaders
of
the
colony
of
massachusetts
and
the
evil
con
sequences
of
such
policy
were
soon
but
too
apparent
and
tended
to
involve
not
only
the
new
settlers
but
also
the
original
colony
of
new
plymouth
in
quarrels
and
disturbances
with
the
natives
this
however
did
not
occur
for
some
time
after
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
and
for
the
present
bradford
succeeded
in
maintaining
the
best
possible
relations
with
the
already
friendly
wampanoges
william
bradford
had
been
originally
brought
up
as
a
husbandman
and
although
he
had
abandoned
this
calling
to
devote
himself
to
the
study
of
the
scriptures
and
the
writings
of
the
fathers
for
which
purpose
he
had
acquired
the
latin
greek
and
hebrew
languages
he
still
retained
such
a
know
ledge
of
agriculture
as
proved
extremely
useful
to
him
as
the
leader
of
a
young
colony
whose
support
was
to
be
mainly
derived
from
the
land
of
which
they
had
taken
possession
he
also
spoke
french
and
dutch
fluently
and
the
diary
and
letters
that
he
has
left
to
posterity
show
him
to
have
been
both
a
well
informed
and
a
truly
pious
man
when
the
puritans
left
amsterdam
under
their
pastor
john
robinson
and
settled
at
leyden
bradford
was
scarcely
twenty
years
of
age
he
there
learnt
the
art
of
dyeing
silk
in
order
to
support
himself
while
he
pursued
his
theological
studies
and
also
performed
the
part
of
historian
to
the
community
of
which
he
had
become
a
member
and
he
remained
with
the
congregation
during
all
the
years
of
their
residence
in
holland
and
attached
himself
with
the
most
affectionate
reverence
to
their
generally
beloved
and
respected
minister
one
of
the
first
acts
of
his
administration
as
governor
of
new
plymouth
was
to
send
another
embassy
to
masasoyt
the
great
sagamore
of
the
whole
wampanoge
tribe
in
order
to
strengthen
and
confirm
his
present
amicable
feelings
towards
the
white
men
by
means
of
presents
and
other
marks
of
friendship
squanto
as
usual
accompanied
the
party
as
interpreter
and
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
than
the
interview
proved
to
all
parties
especially
to
the
indian
chief
who
was
made
both
proud
and
happy
by
the
gift
of
a
red
military
coat
adorned
with
silver
lace
this
he
immediately
put
on
over
the
paint
and
other
savage
ornaments
in
which
he
was
decorated
for
the
state
occasion
and
he
greatly
diverted
the
members
of
the
embassy
by
the
increased
air
of
dignity
that
he
assumed
and
the
grandiloquous
manner
in
which
he
began
to
extol
his
own
power
and
glory
i
not
he
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
the
great
king
am
i
not
lord
of
all
the
people
of
the
lowsons
and
of
such
and
such
places
and
he
enumerated
nearly
thirty
uncouth
indian
names
of
places
over
which
he
claimed
sovereignty
his
wild
subjects
uttering
a
yell
of
joy
and
exultation
in
answer
to
each
word
he
uttered
the
savage
monarch
then
proceeded
to
ratify
and
augment
the
agreement
into
which
he
had
already
catered
with
edward
winslow
and
promised
to
guarantee
to
the
english
settlers
an
exclusive
trade
with
his
tribe
at
the
same
time
entreating
them
to
prevent
his
powerful
enemies
the
narragansetts
from
carrying
on
a
commercial
intercourse
with
the
french
colonists
notwithstanding
the
boasted
power
of
this
of
chiefs
the
scarcity
of
provisions
was
so
great
in
his
village
of
packanokick
at
the
time
of
this
embassy
that
he
was
only
able
to
offer
his
white
friends
one
meal
during
their
visit
to
him
which
lasted
a
day
and
two
nights
and
this
solitary
display
of
regal
hospitality
consisted
of
two
large
fishes
just
caught
in
a
neighboring
lake
and
which
were
divided
amongst
forty
hungry
persons
in
spite
of
this
temporary
distress
he
pressed
the
deputation
to
remain
longer
with
him
but
the
object
of
their
mission
having
been
attained
they
were
glad
to
leave
the
residence
of
the
sagamore
which
possessed
far
less
of
comfort
and
civilization
than
were
to
be
found
in
the
picturesque
summer
camp
of
his
son
and
inferior
sachem
mooanam
this
lovely
spot
continued
to
be
much
frequented
by
the
settlers
between
whom
and
their
neighbors
a
strong
feeling
of
mutual
regard
became
established
and
this
friendship
proved
a
great
advantage
to
both
parties
in
a
social
as
well
as
a
political
point
of
view
the
wampanoges
found
the
benefit
of
their
alliance
with
the
mighty
english
during
the
autumn
of
that
year
when
the
dread
which
their
name
and
power
had
inspired
proved
a
safeguard
to
the
friendly
indian
tribe
and
preserved
them
from
a
combined
attack
of
several
other
tribes
who
had
by
some
mysterious
means
been
instigated
to
unite
for
their
destruction
the
intelligence
of
this
conspiracy
reached
the
settlers
when
a
party
of
them
were
on
the
peninsula
of
cape
cod
whither
they
had
gone
to
bring
back
a
young
english
boy
named
francis
billington
who
had
lost
himself
in
the
forest
some
time
previously
and
after
having
subsisted
for
several
days
on
wild
fruits
and
berries
had
reached
a
camp
of
the
nausett
indians
hitherto
so
adverse
to
the
pilgrims
this
seemed
a
good
opportunity
for
endeavoring
to
establish
more
friendly
relations
with
the
tribe
and
bradford
sent
off
ten
men
in
the
shallop
to
negotiate
for
the

to
the

who
happily
were
not
so
cruel
and
a
party
as
those
who
had
kidnapped
henrich

the
overtures
of
the
settlers
were
well
received
and
they
presented
the
chief
of
the
village
with
a
pair
of
knives
and
also
returned
to
the
natives
a
quantity
of
corn
more
than
equal
to
that
which
they
had
taken
from
the
graves
and
huts
that
they
had
discovered
on
their
first
landing
and
which
belonged
to
the
nausetts
this
act
of
justice
gained
for
the
settlers
the
esteem
and
confidence
of
the
indians
and
as
these
original
possessors
of
the
soil
did
not
dispute
the
title
of
the
newcomers
to
the
portion
of
the
american
soil
on
which

themselves
they
considered
henceforth
that

claim
was
valid

that
they
could
stand
before

as

and
gratitude
of
the
boy
father
at
being
permitted
to
convey
him
home
uninjured
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
and
while
maitland
sympathized
in
his
feelings
he
could
not
help
sadly
contrasting
the
fate
of
his
own
lost
henrich
with
that
of
the
more
fortunate
francis
billington
but
he
believed
that
his
son
earthly
career
had
closed
for
ever
and
both
he
and
helen
had
submitted
to
the
bereavement
with
christian
piety
and
resignation
and
had
taught
their
wounded
hearts
to
restrain
every
impulse
to
repine
and
even
to
feel
thankful
that
their
beloved
boy
had
been
spared
any
protracted
sufferings
and
trials
and
had
been
permitted
so
speedily
to
enter
into
his
rest
had
they
known
his
actual
late
and
condition
how
much
of
painful
anxiety
would
have
mingled
with
the
sorrow
of
separation
from
which
they
were
now
exempt
the
restoration
of
the
little
wanderer
having
been
effected
and
a
good
understanding
having
been
established
with
the
nausetts
of
cape
cod
the
negotiating
party
lost
no
time
in
returning
to
new
plymouth
and
communicating
to
governor
bradford
the
intelligence
of
the
conspiracy
against
masasoyt
to
which
allusion
has
already
been
made
and
of
which
they
had
been
informed
by
the
nausett
sachem
the
news
was
startling
to
bradford
and
to
his
council
who
all
felt
the
imperative
necessity
of
using
immediate
efforts
for
the
assistance
of
the
friendly
wampanoges
they
were
impelled
to
this
resolution
not
only
in
consideration
of
the
alliance
that
had
been
formed
between
themselves
and
the
sagamore
masasoyt
but
also
from
a
conviction
that
the
safety
and
welfare
of
the
infant
colony
depended
essentially
upon
their
possessing
the
friendship
and
the
protection
of
some
powerful
tribe
like
the
wampanoges
whose
numbers
and
warlike
character
caused
them
to
be
both
feared
and
respected
by
their
weaker
neighbors
it
could
only
be
by
a
combination
of
several
tribes
that
any
important
defeat
of
the
wampanoges
could
possibly
be
effected
and
such
a
combination
the
nausetts
declared
they
knew
to
have
been
already
formed
though
by
what
means
and
with
what
motive
remained
at
present
a
mystery
the
indian
interpreter
squanto
was
therefore
sent
off
to
residence
at
lowams
in
order
to
ascertain
the
grounds
of
the
quarrel
and
to
effect
if
possible
a
reconciliation
without
the
necessity
of
the
pilgrims
having
recourse
to
arms
in
defense
of
their
allies
the
interpreter
was
also
accompanied
by
hobomak
a
subject
of
the
wampanoge
chieftain
who
had
lately
left
his
own
wigwams
and
settled
among
the
english
and
who
had
already
attached
himself
to
the
white
men
with
an
uncommon
degree
of
devotion
but
ere
the
swarthy
ambassadors
reached
the
village
of
packanokick
they
were
suddenly
attacked
by
a
small
party
of
narragansett
warriors
who
lay
in
ambush
near
their
path
through
the
forest
and
were
conveyed
away
captives
to
the
presence
of
a
fierce
looking
indian
who
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
power
and
authority
and
who
was
evidently
awaiting
their
arrival
in
a
small
temporary
encampment
at
a
little
distance
no
sooner
had
hobomak
glanced
at
this
dark
chieftain
than
he
recognized
coubitant
the
bitter
foe
of
the
settlers
and
the
captor
of
henrich
maitland
coubitant
had
originally
been
a
subject
of
the
sachem
masasoyt
but
some
offence
either
real
or
imaginary
had
converted
him
from
a
friend
into
a
bitter
foe
and
then
it
was
that
he
had
wandered
towards
the
spanish
settlements
and
obtained
that
prejudiced
notion
of
christianity
to
which
we
have
formerly
alluded
when
tired
of
his
wild
roaming
life
he
had
united
himself
to
that
portion
of
the
nausett
tribe
which
was
under
the
guidance
of
tisquantum
and
his
attachment
to
the
sachem
son
tekoa
had
induced
him
to
remain
a
member
of
the
tribe
during
his
life
and
to
devote
himself
to
the
object
of
revenging
his
death
after
that
event
had
occurred
at
the
first
encounter
with
the
white
settlers
hitherto
that
object
had
been
frustrated
by
what
appeared
to
him
tisquantum
incomprehensible
partiality
fur
henrich
which
had
so
entirely
prevented
his
wreaking
his
vengeance
on
the
innocent
son
of
the
slayer
but
his
was
not
a
revenge
that
could
expire
unsatiated
or
change
to
friendship
and
expend
itself
in
acts
of
kindness
as
that
of
tisquantum
had
done
no
the
thirst
for
blood
remained
as
strong
in
the
breast
of
coubitant
as
it
was
on
that
very
hour
when
he
beheld
his
fall
bleeding
and
dying
beneath
the
mysterious
firearms
of
the
white
men
and
he
hoped
still
to
pour
forth
the
white
man
blood
as
an
oblation
to
the
spirit
of
his
friend
therefore
it
was
that
when
he
found
himself
foiled
in
all
his
malicious
schemes
for
henrich
destruction
and
also
perceived
that
he
was
himself
becoming
an
object
of
suspicion
to
jyanough
and
to
the
sachem
he
had
resolved
on
quitting
the
nausetts
and
returning
with
the
pequodees
into
the
neighborhood
of
the
english
settlement
he
hoped
to
stir
up
several
smaller
tribes
to
join
with
the
narragansetts
and
to
make
war
against
the
wampanoges
the
allies
of
the
pilgrims
and
thus
to
deprive
the
hated
whites
of
their
aid
and
protection
and
possibly
also
to
engage
the
settlers
in
the
quarrel
and
then
to
find
an
opportunity
of
taking
one
or
more
of
them
captive
and
slaking
the
desires
of
his
vindictive
spirit
in
the
agonies
that
he
would
inflict
on
his
victims
truly
dark
places
of
his
heart
were
of
the
habitations
of
cruelty
these
schemes
of
the
wily
savage
had
hitherto
met
with
full
success
and
by
means
of
deceit
and
misrepresentation
he
had
roused
up
and
irritated
the
feelings
of
several
sachems
and
their
dependants
and
induced
them
to
agree
to
coalesce
for
the
destruction
of
the
wampanoges
and
then
to
turn
their
arms
against
the
settlers
with
the
view
of
expelling
them
altogether
from
the
country
his
spies
had
discovered
the
intended
embassy
of
squanto
and
hobomak
to
the
village
of
the
great
sagamore
of
lowams
and
he
had
consequently
taken
effectual
means
to
intercept
it
as
he
feared
its
having
a
favorable
aspect
on
the
captives
being
brought
before
him
he
scornfully
reproached
them
as
the
dastardly
tools
of
the
white
men
and
as
traitors
to
their
own
nation
and
he
declared
his
intention
of
detaining
squanto
as
a
prisoner
and
as
a
hostage
also
in
order
to
ensure
the
return
of
hobomak
to
new
plymouth
with
the
message
that
be
designed
for
the
governor
this
message
consisted
of
a
threat
which
hobomak
well
knew
he
would
execute
that
if
on
being
liberated
he
proceeded
to
packanokick
instead
of
returning
to
the
settlement
he
would
flay
the
unhappy
squanto
alive
and
send
his
skin
and
scalp
to
the
english
to
show
them
that
the
red
men
scorned
their
interference
and
knew
how
to
punish
it
hobomak
departed
and
reluctantly
left
his
companion
in
the
hands
of
the
cruel
coubitant
but
he
had
no
power
to
liberate
him
and
his
only
hope
of
obtaining
any
effectual
succor
for
him
was
in
hastening
to
new
plymouth
and
persuading
the
governor
to
send
a
force
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
narragansetts
and
their
leader
and
attempt
the
rescue
of
their
caked
interpreter
hobomak
was
fleet
of
foot
and
he
rested
not
until
he
had
arrived
in
bradford
presence
and
told
him
of
the
fate
that
had
befallen
squanto
weak
as
the
colonists
were
and
sincerely
desirous
as
they
also
felt
to
preserve
peace
with
the
natives
they
yet
deemed
it
incumbent
on
them
to
show
the
indians
that
they
would
not
tamely
submit
to
any
insult
or
injury
captain
standish
was
therefore
immediately
dispatched
with
a
body
of
fourteen
men
well
armed
and
disciplined
who
were
at
that
time
nearly
all
the
men
capable
of
bearing
arms
of
whom
the
colony
could
boast
led
by
hobomak
they
rapidly
traversed
the
forest
and
came
upon
coubitant
party
soon
after
they
had
left
their
encampment
the
indian
leader
had
anticipated
and
desired
this
result
of
his
conduct
and
his
heart
swelled
with
malignant
joy
when
he
beheld
the
hated
rodolph
among
the
foremost
of
the
assailants
now
he
deemed
the
evil
spirit
whom
he
worshipped
was
about
to
repay
him
for
all
his
abortive
schemes
and
disappointed
efforts
by
throwing
the
very
object
of
his
vengeful
hatred
into
his
power
forward
he
sprang
whirling
his
heavy
tomahawk
round
his
head
as
if
it
had
been
a
child
toy
and
preparing
to
bring
it
down
on
the
white
man
skull
with
a
force
that
must
have
cloven
it
in
two
but
standish
saw
the
impending
blow
and
quick
as
thought
he
drew
a
pistol
from
his
belt
and
fired
it
at
the
savage
the
ball
passed
through
his
arm
and
the
tomahawk
fell
bloodless
to
the
ground
had
it
but
drunk
the
of
rodolph
coubitant
would
have
been
content
to
die
but
his
foe
still
lived
unharmed
and
quickly
he
saw
that
three
of
his
own
followers
were
also
severely
wounded
and
that
his
party
of
naked
warriors
were
altogether
incapable
of
resisting
the
fierce
and
sustained
attack
of
their
civilized
assailants
his
only
chance
of
safety
and
of
future
vengeance
lay
in
flight
and
to
that
last
resource
of
a
brave
spirit
he
betook
himself
he
was
quickly
followed
by
all
his
band
who
were
dismayed
at
the
sound
and
the
fatal
effects
of
the
british
and
leaving
squanto
behind
them
they
were
soon
concealed
from
view
by
the
thick
underwood
of
the
forest
the
object
of
the
expedition
having
been
attained
standish
did
not
pursue
the
fugitives
but
returned
in
triumph
to
the
settlement
well
satisfied
that
he
had
given
the
indians
a
salutary
impression
of
the
decisive
conduct
and
the
powerful
measures
that
would
ever
be
adopted
by
the
white
men
when
their
honor
was
insulted
in
the
slightest
degree
that
such
an
impression
had
been
made
on
the
red
men
was
soon
evident
from
the
anxiety
which
was
manifested
by
several
of
the
neighboring
tribes
to
be
admitted
into
the
semblance
at
least
of
an
alliance
with
the
mighty
strangers
nine
sachems
intimated
their
desire
to
acknowledge
themselves
the
subjects
of
the
white
men
king
who
dwelt
on
the
other
side
of
great
water
and
a
paper
was
accordingly
drawn
up
by
captain
standish
to
that
effect
and
subscribed
with
the
uncouth
autographs
of
the
chieftains
among
these
strange
to
say
the
mark
of
coubitant
who
had
been
raised
to
the
rank
of
sachem
by
the
narragansetts
was
to
be
seen
but
the
sincerity
of
his
friendly
professions
will
be
shown
hereafter
at
present
it
suited
him
to
unite
with
the
other
chiefs
in
their
pledge
of
allegiance
to
king
james
and
of
amity
towards
his
british
subjects
but
he
never
openly
approached
their
settlement
or
made
the
slightest
advance
towards
becoming
better
acquainted
with
them
his
evil
designs
slept
indeed
but
they
had
not
expired
they
only
waited
the
fitting
opportunity
to
be
as
actively
pursued
as
ever

is
gone
but
oh
a
brighter
borne
than
ours
in
heaven
is
now
thine
own
hemans
we
have
observed
that
very
few
deaths
took
place
in
the
colony
of
new
plymouth
during
the
second
year
of
their
exile
and
after
the
fatal
stroke
that
deprived
them
of
their
president
but
among
those
few
there
was
one
that
carried
grief
and
desolation
into
the
hearts
of
the
family
with
whom
our
story
is
chiefly
connected
and
who
were
already
deeply
afflicted
by
the
loss
of
the
ludovico
maitland
had
always
been
a
delicate
child
and
on
him
consequently
the
care
and
attention
of
his
mother
had
been
principally
bestowed
helen
had
watched
and
tended
him
through
all
the
severities
of
the
first
winters
in
the
new
world
and
many
had
been
the
privations
that
she
had
voluntarily
endured
unknown
even
to
rodolph
who
would
not
have
suffered
her
thus
to
risk
her
own
health
in
order
to
add
to
the
comforts
of
her
youngest
and
most
helpless
child
when
the
blessed
springtime
came
and
all
nature
began
again
to
smile
she
hoped
that
ludovico
would
also
be
renovated
and
bloom
again
like
the
flowers
he
loved
so
well
and
her
hopes
appeared
to
be
realized
for
the
sweet
playful
child
resumed
his
sports
and
the
bright
color
again
glowed
on
his
soft
cheek
and
his
parents
deemed
it
the
hue
of
health
at
the
time
when
henrich
was
stolen
away
the
little
fellow
had
been
remarkably
well
and
even
helen
fears
for
him
had
almost
subsided
but
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
the
shock
that
he
sustained
when
he
saw
his
brother
seized
by
the
fierce
savages
and
torn
away
from
him
and
when
he
fled
so
breathlessly
to
tell
the
fearful
tidings
or
whether
it
was
merely
the
result
of
his
own
delicate
constitution
which
could
no
longer
bear
up
against
the
change
of
climate
and
food
from
that
time
he
visibly
declined
it
is
true
he
never
complained
and
his
cheerful
spirits
were
unaltered
but
the
watchful
eye
of
affection
could
trace
the
insidious
steps
of
disease
in
the
changing
color
and
the
too
frequently
brilliant
eye
since
edith
had
lost
her
constant
friend
and
companion
henrich
she
naturally
devoted
herself
more
to
her
younger
brother
and
little
ludovico
became
not
only
her
lively
but
also
her
intelligent
pupil
and
the
occupation
which
she
found
in
the
care
of
the
engaging
child
served
to
divert
her
mind
from
the
first
real
grief
she
had
ever
known
her
mother
sorrow
though
borne
with
the
most
perfect
resignation
had
greatly
affected
her
health
and
as
she
had
entire
confidence
in
edith
steadiness
she
was
glad
to
leave
the
care
of
ludovico
principally
to
her
especially
when
she
observed
the
good
effect
which
the
new
responsibility
had
on
her
spirits
the
two
children
were
therefore
left
much
to
themselves
and
with
their
mother
sanction
they
passed
a
great
portion
of
their
time
at
the
camp
of
mooanam
where
they
were
always
most
kindly
received
and
where
they
made
rapid
progress
in
acquiring
the
language
and
also
many
of
the
useful
and
ingenious
arts
of
their
swarthy
friends
the
departure
of
coubitant
and
his
savage
band
after
their
cruel
design
against
the
peace
of
rodolph
family
had
been
accomplished
removed
all
fears
of
injury
or
molestation
from
the
minds
of
the
settlers
for
no
hostile
indians
now
remained
in
their
immediate
neighborhood
and
the
path
from
new
plymouth
to
the
village
of
the
friendly
wampanoges
became
a
beaten
and
frequented
track
so
that
edith
and
her
little
charge
could
go
to
and
fro
in
safety
under
the
protection
of
fingal
a
magnificent
dog
belonging
to
their
father
and
their
constant
companion
and
playfellow
and
frequently
they
were
accompanied
on
their
return
to
the
british
village
by
the
wife
apannow
and
her
little
boy
nepea
who
was
the
darling
of
both
edith
and
ludovico
a
strong
attachment
also
sprang
up
between
apannow
and
helen
for
the
was
possessed
of
much
natural
gentleness
of
disposition
and
was
most
ready
to
adopt
all
those
habits
of
civilized
life
that
she
saw
practiced
among
her
english
friends
and
that
it
was
possible
for
her
to
transplant
to
her
indian
home
she
was
likewise
willing
to
listen
to
the
doctrines
and
precepts
of
the
gospel
and
to
admit
their
beauty
and
their
holiness
although
it
was
long
very
long
ere
she
or
any
of
the
adults
of
her
tribe
were
so
far
converted
to
the
christian
truth
as
to
be
either
desirous
or
fit
to
be
baptized
but
there
was
no
bigotry
or
opposition
in
the
mind
of
apannow
and
she
became
a
kind
and
sympathizing
friend
to
helen
and
to
her
children
rodolph
was
necessarily
much
engaged
in
agricultural
occupations
and
also
in
the
business
of
the
government
as
he
was
one
of
the
council
who
were
appointed
to
assist
the
president
and
to
share
the
labors
and
responsibilities
of
his
frequently
very
difficult
office
the
gradual
change
in
little
ludovico
health
was
therefore
not
so
soon
observed
by
his
father
as
by
helen
and
edith
and
when
he
returned
to
his
loved
home
after
the
toils
and
cares
of
the
day
his
wife
forbore
to
arouse
fresh
anxiety
in
his
breast
by
telling
him
of
her
own
fears
on
the
contrary
she
rejoiced
to
see
the
pleasure
and
animation
that
lighted
up
the
sweet
child
expressive
countenance
as
he
ran
to
meet
his
father
and
the
happiness
of
both
as
they
played
under
the
spreading
trees
that
shaded
their
now
luxuriant
garden
at
such
times
while
listening
to
ludovico
ringing
laugh
and
watching
his
light
footsteps
as
he
chased
his
father
and
edith
from
tree
to
tree
she
flattered
herself
that
all
must
be
well
with
the
joyous
child
and
that
her
apprehensions
were
unfounded
but
again
when
the
following
day
found
him
pale
and
exhausted
and
all
the
more
so
for
the
excitement
and
exercise
of
the
previous
evening
these
foreboding
fears
would
return
and
her
heart
would
sink
heavily
at
the
prospect
of
the
coming
woe
the
short
summer
of
north
america
attained
its
height
and
as
the
heat
increased
so
did
ludovico
young
life
wane
away
and
his
strength
become
daily
less
rudolph
now
saw
as
plainly
as
his
afflicted
wife
that
their
only
remaining
son
was
soon
to
be
taken
from
them
and
he
strove
to
arm
both
himself
and
her
with
the
only
power
that
could
support
them
under
such
an
aggravated
calamity
he
constantly
led
her
to
look
only
to
him
who
and
who
also
away
and
without
whom
a
sparrow
falleth
to
the
ground
and
to
trust
him
even
in
the
depth
of
sorrow
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
become
more
and
more
resigned
and
more
and
more
strong
in
faith
to
meet
the
coming
trial
slowly
and
gently
it
came
but
it
came
at
last
and
though
his
parents
and
his
sister
had
long
given
up
all
hope
of
retaining
their
loved
ludovico
on
earth
and
had
endeavored
to
resign
him
into
the
hands
of
his
heavenly
father
yet
when
the
blow
came
they
felt
it
sudden
and
found
how
little
they
were
prepared
for
it
one
warm
summer
evening
the
sweet
child
was
carried
by
rodolph
to
edith
bower
that
he
might
look
once
more
at
the
flowers
he
had
helped
to
plant
and
to
tend
and
his
soft
eyes
seemed
to
take
a
last
farewell
of
every
cherished
object
and
to
follow
the
setting
sun
with
a
fixed
gaze
that
said
those
eyes
would
never
see
it
set
again
but
there
was
no
sadness
no
regret
in
the
gentle
countenance
and
the
infantine
lips
still
smiled
as
they
whispered
the
evening
prayer
that
he
had
so
often
repeated
with
edith
young
as
he
was
ludovico
had
learnt
to
love
his
redeemer
and
to
feel
that
to
and
be
with
christ
was
far
better
than
to
abide
on
earth
and
the
of
the
shadow
or
death
which
the
lord
so
mercifully
made
easy
to
his
flesh
had
no
terrors
for
his
young
spirit
could
his
parents
then
could
even
his
sister
bear
to
disturb
his
angelic
calmness
by
any
display
of
their
own
grief
no
they
restrained
it
and
even
tried
to
smile
again
as
they
replied
to
his
touching
remarks
and
spoke
of
the
happy
day
when
they
should
all
meet
again
in
heaven
and
dwell
for
ever
in
the
presence
of
that
gracious
savior
who
was
new
taking
him
as
they
believed
to
join
his
dear
brother
henrich
as
twilight
came
on
his
father
bore
him
back
to
the
house
and
laid
him
again
on
his
little
couch
and
ere
the
glorious
sun
arose
to
lighten
the
earth
once
more
his
spirit
had
passed
away
into
that
realm
of
perfect
light
where
they
no
need
of
the
sun
neither
of
the
moon
to
shine
in
it
for
the
glory
of
god
does
lighten
it
and
the
lamb
is
the
light
thereof
and
many
tears
were
shed
for
him
when
the
sight
of
the
grief
of
those
he
loved
so
dearly
could
no
longer
disturb
his
peace
or
check
the
willing
spirit
in
its
heavenward
flight
the
sorrows
of
the
maitlands
thus
renewed
and
aggravated
excited
the
warmest
sympathy
throughout
the
colony
for
they
were
universally
respected
and
beloved
and
their
calm
and
pious
resignation
drew
forth
the
admiration
of
the
whole
community
of
puritans
who
deemed
any
strong
expressions
of
grief
to
be
altogether
unsuitable
to
christians
but
rodolph
and
helen
did
not
the
less
feel
their
chastisement
because
they
forbore
to
express
their
feelings
to
any
other
than
to
god
and
to
their
revered
friend
and
minister
brewster
on
edith
this
second
blow
fell
even
more
heavily
than
the
first
for
since
henrich
loss
she
had
devoted
herself
to
her
younger
brother
and
felt
for
him
almost
a
mother
love
and
now
her
pupil
her
playfellow
the
sunshine
of
her
life
was
taken
away
from
her
truly
the
lord
was
preparing
her
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
for
the
future
lot
to
which
he
had
appointed
her
and
sorrow
did
net
visit
her
in
vain
her
character
was
strengthened
and
matured
and
her
mind
was
taught
to
find
resources
in
itself
that
proved
hereafter
of
inestimable
value
to
her
and
to
those
most
nearly
connected
with
her
the
thoughts
and
attention
of
her
parents
and
indeed
of
the
whole
colony
were
at
this
time
diverted
greatly
from
their
own
private
cares
and
interests
by
an
event
of
much
importance
to
the
settlement
this
was
the
arrival
of
a
vessel
called
the
fortune
from
the
country
bringing
out
to
the
colony
a
new
and
more
comprehensive
charter
obtained
for
them
by
the
society
of
plymouth
and
also
five
fresh
settlers
who
were
chiefly
friends
and
relatives
of
those
already
established
in
new
england
how
welcome
these
familiar
countenances
that
recalled
days
of
happiness
long
passed
but
not
forgotten
were
to
the
hearts
and
memories
of
their
brethren
none
but
exiles
can
tell
the
new
comers
were
indeed
joyfully
received
and
hospitably
entertained
by
the
pilgrim
fathers
who
invited
them
to
take
up
their
quarters
in
their
rude
but
comfortable
dwellings
and
to
share
their
scanty
stores
unfortunately
the
new
settlers
were
unable
to
contribute
any
thing
to
these
stores
for
all
their
own
provisions
were
already
consumed
on
the
voyage
this
accession
to
their
numbers
therefore
added
greatly
to
the
inconvenience
of
the
colony
and
occasioned
such
a
scarcity
of
food
that
the
governor
was
obliged
to
put
the
whole
community
upon
a
daily
allowance
an
arrangement
to
which
they
all
submitted
without
a
murmur
and
not
only
did
the
original
settlers
thus
consent
to
endure
privation
for
the
sake
of
their
arrived
friends
and
relatives
but
they
also
contributed
more
liberally
than
their
narrow
means
could
well
afford
to
provision
the
fortune
for
her
voyage
home
this
was
the
occasion
of
the
first
mercantile
adventure
of
the
pilgrims
who
took
the
opportunity
of
the
return
of
the
ship
to
england
to
send
to
the
society
with
which
they
were
connected
a
quantity
of
furs
and
timber
to
the
value
of
five
hundred
pounds
but
success
did
not
attend
their
speculation
for
the
vessel
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
french
and
all
their
hopes
of
profit
were
for
the
present
blasted
it
is
needless
to
dwell
on
all
the
continued
and
various
hardships
that
these
brave
men
and
their
families
had
to
endure
for
several
ensuing
winters
a
few
circumstances
that
more
especially
exemplify
their
manners
and
mode
of
life
will
be
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
our
narrative
the
course
of
which
must
necessarily
be
somewhat
interrupted
by
these
details
some
knowledge
of
the
habits
of
the
adventurers
and
of
the
events
that
befell
them
at
this
early
period
of
their
history
is
however
needful
for
the
illustration
of
the
story
and
they
shall
be
briefly
given
before
we
take
up
the
thread
of
the
narrative
a
few
years
subsequent
to
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
for
some
time
the
friendly
relations
with
the
wampanoges
which
had
been
established
by
carver
and
further
cemented
by
bradford
remained
undisturbed
and
no
signs
of
hostility
were
shown
by
any
other
of
the
neighboring
indian
tribes
this
was
probably
owing
in
a
great
degree
to
the
wholesome
example
of
decided
measures
that
had
been
given
to
the
natives
on
the
occasion
of
the
capture
of
hobomak
and
squanto
and
also
to
the
efficient
means
of
defense
that
were
now
adopted
by
the
settlers
on
their
first
arrival
in
new
england
they
had
planted
their
guns
on
the
hill
which
commanded
the
rising
city
of
new
plymouth
and
which
afterwards
received
the
name
of
burying
hill
there
as
we
have
seen
the
remains
of
the
venerable
carver
were
deposited
and
there
the
infant
form
of
ludovico
maitland
was
laid
in
its
last
narrow
and
shaded
by
shrubs
and
plants
that
edith
and
the
faithful
servant
janet
delighted
to
place
there
and
to
tend
and
water
with
untiring
care
and
watchfulness
this
hill
was
converted
during
the
first
year
of
the
residence
in
new
england
into
a
kind
of
irregular
fortification
the
storehouse
which
was
also
the
chapel
and
the
council
hall
stood
on
the
summit
and
this
was
surrounded
by
a
strong
wall
of
timber
well
furnished
with
batteries
on
which
a
watch
was
kept
night
and
day
to
look
out
for
the
approach
of
any
hostile
parties
of
indians
at
a
considerable
distance
from
this
building
ran
a
strong
wooden
palisade
that
enclosed
the
height
entirely
and
was
divided
into
four
portions
the
entrance
to
which
was
securely
fastened
every
night
and
the
bodied
men
of
the
colony
under
the
command
of
miles
standish
were
arranged
in
four
squadrons
to
the
care
of
each
of
which
one
quarter
was
entrusted
the
occupation
which
this
charge
entailed
on
the
limited
number
of
men
who
were
capable
of
undertaking
it
in
addition
to
their
necessary
labors
and
employments
in
building
their
dwellings
cultivating
their
fields
and
procuring
provisions
by
hunting
and
fishing
was
both
heavy
and
incessant
but
disease
had
nearly
left
the
colony
and
want
though
occasionally
felt
to
a
painful
degree
was
not
always
their
portion
and
the
pilgrim
fathers
were
cheerfully
contented
with
their
lot
still
it
was
a
lot
that
involved
much
of
hardship
and
personal
privation
as
a
drawback
to
the
liberty
both
religious
and
political
that
had
been
obtained
by
emigration
the
harvests
were
scanty
and
not
nearly
sufficient
to
provide
bread
for
the
increasing
community
and
also
seed
for
the
following
year
and
the
supplies
that
were
occasionally
procured
from
the
wampanoges
and
their
allies
were
very
uncertain
at
one
time
every
species
of
grain
became
so
scarce
that
the
settlers
had
recourse
to
as
a
substitute
for
bread
and
the
last
pint
of
corn
that
remained
to
the
colony
after
the
fields
were
sown
was
counted
out
among
the
whole
community
when
fell
to
the
share
of
each
person
and
these
were
looked
upon
as
a
rare
treat
and
eaten
as
a
particular
dainty
cattle
were
as
yet
unknown
in
the
colony
and
their
chief
subsistence
consisted
of
game
wild
fowl
and
fish
of
which
the
supply
was
frequently
both
scanty
and
precarious
we
are
told
in
the
diary
of
the
governor
bradford
do
not
know
in
the
evening
where
we
shall
get
a
meal
next
morning
but
yet
we
bear
our
want
with
joy
and
trust
in
providence
and
strong
indeed
must
have
been
the
faith
and
patience
of
these
pilgrim
fathers
which
sustained
their
spirits
amidst
such
trials
and
enabled
them
to
meet
and
overcome
such
complicated
difficulties
without
hesitation
and
without
a
murmur
at
one
period
their
only
food
was
fish
and
occasionally
merely
shellfish
but
never
was
this
miserable
fare
partaken
of
by
the
emigrants
who
assembled
to
receive
their
respective
portions
without
a
blessing
being
asked
and
thanks
being
offered
by
the
pious
brewster
who
with
a
spirit
of
gratitude
too
often
unknown
to
those
who
revel
in
abundance
praised
god
for
having
permitted
them
suck
out
of
the
fullness
of
the
sea
and
for
the
treasures
sunk
in
the
sand
while
such
an
example
of
holy
trust
and
patient
submission
to
the
will
of
god
was
set
by
the
leading
men
of
this
suffering
colony
men
who
were
both
loved
and
respected
not
a
complaining
word
was
uttered
by
the
rest
all
felt
that
they
were
bound
to
emulate
the
faith
and
piety
of
their
governor
and
their
venerated
elder
and
truly
they
had
need
of
every
motive
and
of
every
aid
both
human
and
divine
that
could
keep
their
souls
in
peace
when
actual
famine
at
length
stared
them
in
the
face
the
second
winter
had
been
endured
and
in
spite
of
cold
and
privation
the
health
of
the
colony
had
improved
and
spring
again
brought
brighter
hopes
and
better
prospects
of
the
summer
harvest
but
before
the
grain
was
well
grown
up
a
drought
came
on
that
threatened
the
utter
destruction
of
the
crops
for
six
long
weeks
not
one
drop
of
rain
fell
on
the
thirsty
land
sky
was
as
brass
to
the
fainting
emigrants
and
earth
was
as
iron
to
them
yet
these
men
of
god
did
not
despair
they
were
accustomed
to
regard
every
dispensation
of
providence
whether
prosperous
or
afflictive
either
as
a
special
blessing
from
the
hand
of
god
to
support
and
encourage
his
believing
people
or
as
a
fatherly
chastisement
to
punish
their
iniquities
and
excite
them
to
greater
piety
and
watchfulness
pleased
god
said
edward
winslow
in
speaking
of
this
inflict
ion
send
a
great
dearth
for
our
further
punishment
under
this
conviction
the
congregation
were
called
on
by
the
governor
and
the
elders
to
set
apart
a
day
for
special
humiliation
and
prayer
in
order
to
entreat
the
lord
to
remove
from
them
his
chastening
hand
and
to
a
gracious
rain
upon
his
inheritance
the
call
was
universally
obeyed
and
men
women
and
children
assembled
themselves
together
fasting
on
burying
hill
to
listen
to
the
solemn
address
delivered
by
brewster
and
to
unite
in
fervent
prayers
and
humble
confessions
to
their
god
and
father
the
sky
that
morning
was
clear
and
bright
as
ever
and
the
sun
walked
in
unclouded
brilliance
and
majesty
through
the
deep
blue
vault
of
heaven
for
eight
hours
the
devotions
of
the
assembly
continued
almost
without
interruption
and
it
seemed
as
if
regarded
neither
was
there
any
that
answered
but
as
the
sun
was
sinking
towards
the
western
horizon
a
cloud
it
were
a
hand
was
seen
to
rise
as
if
to
meet
the
glowing
orb
and
ere
he
sank
his
rays
were
obscured
by
a
heavy
bank
of
clouds
joy
and
gratitude
now
filled
the
breasts
of
the
suppliants
and
the
dim
and
anxious
eye
of
many
a
mother
who
had
watched
the
declining
forms
of
her
little
ones
in
silent
anguish
was
lighted
up
with
hope
and
glistened
with
a
tear
of
thankfulness
such
indeed
had
been
the
sufferings
of
the
younger
children
although
the
greatest
sacrifices
had
been
made
by
their
parents
in
order
to
provide
them
with
the
food
so
necessary
to
their
existence
that
helen
had
frequently
poured
forth
her
heartfelt
thanksgivings
to
her
heavenly
father
that
he
had
seen
fit
to
remove
her
gentle
and
idolized
ludovico
from
a
scene
of
so
much
distress
and
had
called
him
away
to
a
land
where
want
as
well
as
sorrow
is
unknown
in
a
manner
and
at
a
time
which
allowed
her
to
ensure
his
ease
and
comfort
to
the
last
to
have
seen
her
darling
pine
for
food
which
she
could
not
procure
for
him
to
have
watched
that
child
sinking
into
his
grave
from
the
actual
want
of
proper
nourishment
and
to
know
that
in
the
land
they
had
abandoned
all
that
was
needed
to
prolong
his
precious
life
was
teeming
in
profusion
would
she
weakly
thought
have
been
more
than
her
faith
could
have
endured
but
helen
erred
in
that
doubting
thought
she
was
a
and
had
her
lord
and
savior
seen
fit
thus
to
try
her
he
would
also
have
given
her
grace
to
meet
the
trial
as
a
for
his
promise
to
each
one
of
his
people
is
sure
thy
day
is
so
shall
thy
strength
be
edith
her
only
remaining
child
was
strong
and
energetic
in
mind
and
body
and
she
was
no
burden
to
her
mother
cheerfully
she
had
borne
her
share
of
privation
and
uncomplainingly
she
had
assisted
helen
and
janet
in
seeking
for
roots
and
berries
hour
after
hour
in
the
forest
when
no
other
food
was
to
be
obtained
now
on
this
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
she
stood
beside
her
mother
and
rodolph
and
lifted
up
her
young
voice
in
prayer
for
heavenly
succor
and
in
praise
when
the
first
signal
of
coming
aid
was
seen
in
the
crimson
west
the
whole
congregation
had
risen
from
their
posture
of
supplication
and
were
gazing
with
deep
interest
and
emotion
at
the
gathering
clouds
when
they
were
startled
at
observing
a
large
party
of
indians
emerging
from
the
thicket
below
and
advancing
towards
the
palisade
that
formed
their
outer
fortification
at
first
they
imagined
them
to
be
a
hostile
body
of
narragansetts
or
pequodees
who
had
discovered
the
manner
in
which
that
day
was
being
spent
among
the
and
had
resolved
upon
breaking
the
treaty
and
attempting
their
destruction
while
they
were
thus
assembled
together
and
unarmed
but
these
apprehensions
were
soon
removed
by
the
appearance
of
their
friend
mooanam
who
advanced
from
the
rest
of
his
party
and
hurried
forward
holding
in
his
hands
a
fine
fish
and
calling
on
his
allies
to
open
their
gates
and
admit
him
and
his
followers
into
the
fortress
for
that
he
had
brought
them
food
joyfully
his
summons
was
answered
and
the
generous
red
men
entered
the
enclosure
and
laid
before
the
governor
a
quantity
of
fish
sufficient
to
supply
the
whole
community
with
several
wholesome
and
acceptable
meals
the
kindness
of
this
offering
was
highly
estimated
by
the
settlers
for
they
well
knew
that
their
indian
friends
had
long
been
suffering
privations
little
less
than
what
they
had
themselves
endured
and
that
their
prospects
for
the
future
were
hardly
more
cheering
than
their
own
the
native
and
untaught
courtesy
also
with
which
the
seasonable
gift
was
offered
added
not
a
little
to
its
value
said
mooanam
to
the
president
when
he
and
his
attendants
had
placed
the
fresh
spoils
of
their
lake
in
order
before
him
what
the
good
mahneto
has
given
to
his
children
in
their
day
of
distress
and
the
red
men
could
not
eat
and
be
in
plenty
while
they
knew
that
the
faces
of
their
white
brethren
were
pale
with
want
and
their
little
children
were
crying
for
food
take
this
my
brother
and
let
the
hearts
of
your
people
be
glad
and
bless
mahneto
while
they
eat
i
and
my
young
men
will
return
to
the
supper
that
our
squaws
are
preparing
do
bless
mahneto
who
is
the
god
and
father
both
of
the
red
and
white
men
replied
bradford
with
solemnity
for
he
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
pious
feelings
of
the
sachem
and
touched
by
his
considerate
kindness
do
bless
mahneto
and
we
bless
you
also
our
faithful
and
generous
friends
who
have
thus
so
promptly
shared
with
us
the
produce
of
your
labors
instead
of
reserving
it
for
your
own
future
wants
but
here
is
enough
for
you
and
us
and
you
and
your
young
men
must
abide
tonight
in
our
village
and
partake
with
us
of
the
abundance
that
you
have
provided
we
leave
the
future
in
the
bountiful
hands
of
him
who
has
thus
made
you
his
instruments
to
provide
for
us
a
table
in
the
wilderness
will
remain
said
mooanam
some
of
your
people
shall
go
with
us
to
our
lakes
and
fish
in
our
canoes
the
clouds
are
rising
and
we
shall
perhaps
have
even
better
success
than
we
have
met
with
today
but
tell
me
my
white
brother
he
continued
while
he
looked
inquiringly
at
bradford
me
why
your
village
is
deserted
this
evening
and
why
no
sounds
of
labor
met
our
ears
as
we
passed
through
the
silent
street
this
is
not
the
white
men
day
of
rest
and
the
white
men
do
not
leave
their
work
to
sleep
or
dance
as
the
red
men
too
often
do
why
then
are
you
and
your
people
even
your
squaws
and
your
little
ones
assembled
here
today
and
what
caused
that
joyful
song
that
died
away
as
we
came
to
the
foot
hill
have
spent
the
day
in
fasting
and
prayer
replied
the
president
know
that
our
great
father
has
sent
this
long
drought
upon
us
to
chasten
us
for
our
sins
and
we
have
met
to
humble
ourselves
before
him
and
implore
him
to
send
us
the
fruitful
showers
from
heaven
before
our
crops
are
altogether
withered
in
the
ground
he
alone
can
command
the
clouds
to
drop
fatness
and
when
he
sees
that
his
punishment
has
done
its
appointed
work
he
surely
will
take
it
away
even
now
while
we
were
making
our
prayers
and
supplications
unto
him
and
confessing
our
sins
he
has
sent
a
token
that
he
has
heard
our
cry
and
will
grant
our
request
look
at
those
clouds
that
are
rising
over
the
western
hills
and
gradually
spreading
like
a
curtain
across
the
sky
for
six
weary
weeks
those
clouds
have
been
withheld
and
we
have
been
humbled
and
at
times
our
faith
has
well
nigh
failed
but
the
faithfulness
of
our
god
never
fails
and
now
we
are
confident
that
ere
long
his
blessing
will
descend
upon
us
mooanam
made
no
reply
but
he
gazed
intently
on
the
gathering
clouds
and
then
looked
searchingly
into
bradford
fine
expressive
countenance
as
if
to
be
assured
that
he
had
heard
and
understood
aright
squanto
stood
beside
him
and
his
aid
had
been
several
times
required
by
both
parties
in
order
to
the
carrying
out
the
above
discourse
and
now
the
sachem
drew
him
aside
and
conversed
earnestly
with
him
in
a
low
voice
he
was
making
him
repeat
in
his
own
tongue
the
words
of
the
white
man
and
bradford
heard
him
say
to
the
interpreter
as
he
turned
away
to
rejoin
him
we
shall
see
whether
the
great
spirit
really
hears
the
prayers
of
the
white
men
the
president
understood
this
remark
and
fervently
he
lifted
up
his
own
heart
to
the
lord
and
prayed
that
the
hopes
of
his
suffering
and
trusting
people
might
now
be
fulfilled
not
only
for
their
own
relief
but
also
that
the
minds
of
the
dark
heathen
might
be
impressed
and
that
they
might
see
and
feel
the
power
and
the
goodness
of
the
christians
covenant
god
while
mooanam
and
the
governor
were
engaged
in
conversation
the
assembly
had
dispersed
to
their
own
homes
each
family
carrying
with
them
their
respective
portion
of
the
food
so
liberally
offered
by
their
indian
friends
and
eager
to
partake
of
the
first
plentiful
meal
that
they
had
enjoyed
for
several
weeks
the
hope
of
coming
rain
also
cheered
the
hearts
of
the
pilgrims
and
there
was
joy
and
gratitude
throughout
the
village
that
evening
the
sachem
and
his
people
were
gladly
received
and
entertained
in
the
dwellings
of
the
governor
and
principal
inhabitants
and
when
mooanam
lay
down
to
rest
he
long
gazed
through
the
opening
in
the
wooden
wall
of
the
chamber
that
formed
its
only
window
and
watched
the
heavy
clouds
as
they
sped
across
the
sky
and
observed
the
face
of
the
glimmering
moon
that
looked
out
so
calmly
and
brightly
between
their
dark
moving
masses
the
soul
of
the
sachem
was
deeply
impressed
and
he
thought
of
all
that
bradford
had
said
to
him
and
wondered
whether
the
god
of
the
white
men
was
indeed
the
god
of
the
indians
also
chapter

before

will
answer

while
they
are
yet
speaking

hear
isa
lxv
mooanam
awoke
from
his
sleep
soon
after
the
dawn
of
day
appeared
he
looked
up
at
the
open
window
and
a
strange
feeling
of
awe
came
over
his
soul
as
he
beheld
the
rain
falling
gently
and
steadily
from
the
dull
grey
sky
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
hurried
into
the
next
apartment
where
he
found
the
president
and
his
family
already
assembled
and
gazing
at
the
descending
shower
in
silent
admiration
the
sachem
caught
the
hands
of
bradford
in
both
his
own
and
while
a
tear
of
deep
emotion
glistened
in
his
dark
eye
he
exclaimed
i
see
that
your
god
loves
you
when
the
red
men
ask
for
rain
and
use
their
conjuring
arts
to
induce
the
great
spirit
to
hear
their
wild
cries
he
gives
it
it
is
true
but
he
gives
it
with
hail
and
thunder
which
makes
the
evil
still
greater
your
rain
is
of
the
right
kind
it
will
restore
the
drooping
corn
now
we
see
that
your
god
hears
you
and
cares
for
you
the
same
impression
to
a
certain
degree
was
made
on
all
the
indians
who
were
taught
to
regard
this
seasonable
rain
as
the
settlers
themselves
regarded
it
as
a
special
interposition
of
providence
for
their
relief
and
were
they
wrong
in
thus
looking
upon
it
as
an
answer
to
their
prayers
from
a
god
and
was
it
vain
superstition
that
led
them
to
rejoice
as
much
in
this
proof
of
the
goodness
and
benevolence
of
the
god
whom
they
served
and
of
his
guiding
and
protecting
hand
being
outstretched
for
their
succor
as
in
the
prospect
of
coming
plenty
that
was
thus
afforded
to
them
surely
not
their
faith
and
love
and
confidence
in
god
were
all
animated
and
strengthened
by
their
conviction
that
the
relief
thus
seasonably
received
came
directly
from
him
who
has
promised
in
his
faithful
word
that
things
whether
joyous
or
grievous
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
him
to
them
that
are
called
according
to
his
so
deeply
was
hobomak
the
wampanoge
interpreter
impressed
by
this
instance
of
the
pious
trust
of
his
white
friends
in
the
providence
of
their
god
and
of
the
protection
they
enjoyed
under
his
guidance
and
government
that
he
gave
himself
up
to
a
serious
consideration
of
their
religion
and
so
sincere
was
his
desire
for
spiritual
knowledge
and
so
humble
and
teachable
did
he
show
himself
that
after
a
time
he
was
judged
fit
to
be
admitted
into
the
pale
of
the
christian
church
he
was
baptized
as
the
first
fruits
of
the
settlers
efforts
to
evangelize
the
heathen
among
whom
they
had
cast
their
lot
and
he
lived
a
firm
friend
of
the
white
men
and
died
after
residing
many
years
among
them
a
that
his
soul
went
to
the
welcome
rain
continued
to
fall
for
several
hours
without
intermission
on
the
morning
that
succeeded
the
pilgrim
day
of
prayer
and
humiliation
and
mooanam
sent
his
young
men
home
to
fish
in
the
lake
while
he
remained
with
his
white
friends
intending
to
follow
them
in
the
afternoon
with
a
party
of
the
settlers
to
share
their
sport
as
the
day
advanced
the
clouds
broke
and
warm
sunshine
interrupted
by
frequent
refreshing
showers
succeeded
to
the
settled
rain
of
the
morning
so
favorable
altogether
was
the
change
that
winslow
gratefully
remarks
is
difficult
to
say
whether
our
withered
corn
or
our
depressed
spirits
were
most
refreshed
and
quickened
so
great
was
the
benevolence
and
goodness
of
our
god
the
pilgrims
had
prayed
for
rain
and
when
their
prayers
were
granted
they
did
not
neglect
the
equally
incumbent
christian
duty
of
thanksgiving
again
the
congregation
ascended
burying
hill
and
again
their
united
voices
rose
to
heaven
in
prayers
and
songs
of
praise
mooanam
formed
one
of
the
assembly
and
he
listened
with
deep
and
reverent
attention
to
the
devotions
of
his
friends
frequently
applying
to
hobomak
who
stood
at
his
side
to
explain
to
him
the
words
and
sentences
that
he
did
not
comprehend
the
service
concluded
and
the
women
and
children
were
descending
the
hill
by
the
path
that
led
to
the
village
leaving
the
governor
and
his
council
to
discuss
some
public
business
and
the
other
men
to
arrange
themselves
as
usual
into
companies
for
the
manning
of
their
fortification
and
other
necessary
employments
just
at
that
moment
a
native
attired
in
the
costume
and
equipments
of
a
narragansett
was
seen
to
approach
the
foot
of
the
hill
bearing
a
bundle
of
strange
appearance
in
his
hands
with
a
quick
and
decided
step
he
mounted
the
height
and
glanced
fiercely
at
the
females
and
their
children
whom
he
passed
in
the
winding
path
and
who
all
involuntarily
shrank
from
the
gaze
of
his
piercing
and
singularly
expressive
eye
in
the
breast
of
janet
that
glance
struck
a
chill
of
horror
for
she
had
once
before
encountered
it
and
never
could
she
forget
or
mistake
it
again
it
seemed
that
fingal
recognized
it
also
and
knew
the
evil
that
it
foreboded
he
was
bounding
down
the
hill
by
edith
side
and
with
expressive
looks
and
actions
inviting
the
pensive
child
to
join
in
his
gambols
when
the
savage
approached
instantly
he
paused
and
took
his
stand
close
to
his
young
mistress
as
if
to
guard
her
from
some
apprehended
danger
and
as
the
red
warrior
passed
and
bent
his
eye
on
edith
the
sagacious
creature
uttered
a
low
deep
growl
and
seemed
ready
to
spring
at
his
throat
if
the
hand
and
voice
of
his
young
companion
had
not
restrained
him
fingal
was
a
noble
specimen
of
the
bernard
breed
of
dogs
whose
sagacity
is
such
as
frequently
to
appear
like
human
reason
and
his
intelligence
was
not
inferior
to
that
of
the
best
of
his
race
in
this
instance
it
did
not
mislead
him
the
dark
warrior
strode
on
without
one
sign
of
courtesy
and
paused
not
until
he
had
entered
the
group
of
elders
and
councilors
who
stood
around
the
president
prepared
to
attend
him
to
the
public
hall
the
white
men
made
way
for
him
to
approach
the
governor
and
as
he
did
so
his
keen
eye
met
that
of
rodolph
maitland
and
instantly
kindled
with
a
deeper
fire
and
gleamed
with
an
expression
of
almost
diabolical
vengeance
which
was
seen
by
rodolph
and
understood
by
him
for
he
too
could
not
fail
to
recognize
in
the
narragansett
warrior
that
same
coubitant
who
had
fought
so
well
at
first
encounter
and
who
had
afterwards
attended
the
nausett
chief
tisquantum
when
he
and
his
people
were
repulsed
in
their
attack
on
new
plymouth
it
was
evident
to
maitland
that
this
savage
entertained
towards
him
and
his
race
a
peculiar
sentiment
of
hatred
but
the
cause
of
this
feeling
was
unknown
to
him
the
idea
however
that
henrich
loss
was
in
some
way
connected
with
this
man
or
that
he
could
give
him
some
information
respecting
the
nature
of
his
son
death
and
the
place
where
his
remains
had
been
deposited
came
forcibly
to
his
mind
and
regardless
of
the
cold
malignant
gaze
that
coubitant
fixed
on
him
he
hastily
approached
him
and
exclaimed
in
the
indian
tongue
you
are
the
nausett
warrior
whom
i
saw
with
the
sachem
of
that
tribe
if
so
you
can
tell
me
the
fate
of
my
son
the
boy
who
was
carried
off
and
i
fear
cruelly
slain
when
tisquantum
and
his
people
retired
from
these
woods
o
tell
me
how
my
boy
was
murdered
and
where
his
dear
remains
were
laid
rodolph
fine
countenance
was
lighted
up
with
eager
animation
a
tear
of
fond
regret
and
affection
glistened
in
his
eye
and
he
could
have
grasped
the
hand
of
the
swarthy
savage
and
almost
have
blessed
him
if
he
would
have
told
him
that
his
darling
henrich
had
died
by
a
single
blow
and
that
his
body
had
been
laid
unmolested
to
rest
but
coubitant
drew
back
and
with
a
smile
of
fierce
mockery
and
infernal
triumph
replied
briefly
you
found
his
bloody
coat
then
may
your
heart
blood
soon
flow
forth
as
his
did
and
may
my
eyes
see
your
body
equally
mangled
and
defaced
at
the
same
moment
he
placed
the
bundle
that
he
carried
on
the
ground
before
the
president
saying
comes
from
the
chief
of
the
narragansetts
and
turning
away
hastily
descended
the
hill
and
was
lost
to
view
among
the
trees
of
the
skirting
wood
before
the
council
had
time
to
resolve
on
the
course
they
should
pursue
respecting
his
detention
or
rodolph
had
recovered
the
shock
that
his
cruel
words
had
inflicted
the
curiosity
of
the
governor
and
his
friends
was
now
directed
to
the
package
that
lay
on
the
ground
on
examination
they
found
the
envelope
to
be
composed
of
a
dried
snakeskin
which
was
quickly
opened
and
disclosed
several
indian
arrows
squanto
gazed
on
these
with
a
significant
look
and
on
being
questioned
by
bradford
as
to
the
meaning
of
so
singular
an
offering
he
informed
him
that
it
was
the
native
mode
of
declaring
war
the
enmity
of
the
narragansetts
towards
the
wampanoges
the
friends
and
allies
of
the
settlers
rendered
this
hostile
declaration
no
surprise
to
the
governor
and
his
council
but
the
fact
of
its
being
conveyed
by
coubitant
who
had
so
lately
in
the
character
of
a
subordinate
narragansett
chieftain
subscribed
the
written
acknowledgement
of
king
james
supremacy
excited
no
small
astonishment
it
was
a
source
also
of
regret
as
it
proved
how
little
dependence
could
be
placed
in
the
professions
of
the
natives
to
enter
on
a
war
with
the
numerous
and
powerful
tribe
of
the
narragansetts
was
likewise
far
from
being
desirable
in
any
point
of
view
for
the
pilgrims
were
little
prepared
either
to
meet
such
formidable
antagonist
in
the
field
or
to
resist
the
continual
attacks
and
aggression
that
constitute
the
greatest
share
of
indian
warfare
a
consultation
was
therefore
held
as
to
the
best
method
of
replying
to
the
challenge
of
the
narragansett
sachem
and
it
was
finally
determined
that
the
most
prudent
and
effectual
course
would
be
to
show
a
resolute
appearance
and
give
no
cause
to
the
native
to
suppose
that
they
dreaded
their
enmity
a
bold
acceptance
of
the
challenge
might
it
was
urged
both
by
squanto
and
hobomak
strike
terror
into
the
savages
and
deter
them
from
prosecuting
their
present
hostile
intentions
bradford
therefore
adopted
the
indian
method
of
communicating
this
reply
by
expressive
signs
and
taking
the
arrows
which
appeared
to
be
poisoned
from
the
snakeskin
he
placed
some
gunpowder
and
balls
in
the
significant
wrapper
he
then
inquired
who
among
his
trusty
would
volunteer
to
take
the
packet
to
the
dwelling
of
cundincus
the
chief
of
the
narragansetts
several
offered
their
services
and
among
those
none
was
so
eager
to
be
employed
as
rodolph
maitland
he
felt
an
earnest
desire
to
see
and
speak
with
coubitant
once
more
and
no
fear
of
the
personal
risk
that
he
might
incur
in
the
expedition
could
deter
him
from
thus
making
another
attempt
to
obtain
some
certain
information
respecting
his
lost
son
footnote
afterwards
called
by
the
settlers
had
the
president
known
how
much
reason
there
was
to
fear
that
treachery
might
be
exercised
towards
maitland
he
would
surely
not
have
suffered
him
thus
to
risk
his
valuable
life
rut
he
was
ignorant
of
all
the
peculiar
circumstances
that
had
occurred
to
show
that
he
was
a
special
mark
for
the
vengeance
of
coubitant
and
the
confidence
he
felt
in
his
courage
and
ability
led
him
on
this
occasion
as
on
many
others
to
select
him
as
his
ambassador
two
companions
were
assigned
to
him
and
squanto
was
desired
to
attend
the
party
as
interpreter
when
helen
heard
that
her
husband
was
appointed
to
convey
a
reply
to
the
message
of
the
dark
savage
whom
she
had
met
on
the
hill
and
whose
aspect
had
filled
her
with
terror
she
felt
an
involuntary
dread
and
gladly
would
she
have
dissuaded
him
from
accepting
the
office
of
ambassador
which
she
knew
not
he
had
so
earnestly
solicited
had
she
not
been
well
aware
that
all
such
attempts
would
be
useless
rodolph
was
not
a
man
to
shrink
from
any
service
that
was
required
of
him
for
the
public
good
and
least
of
all
from
any
service
that
involved
danger
and
difficulty
he
however
concealed
from
his
anxious
wife
the
fact
that
he
had
recognized
in
the
narragansett
messenger
a
deadly
and
determined
foe
knowing
how
greatly
and
perhaps
how
justly
her
fears
would
be
increased
if
she
suspected
that
the
indian
champion
was
one
of
those
who
had
planned
and
executed
the
capture
of
her
eldest
son
but
janet
had
as
we
have
seen
remembered
the
swarthy
savage
and
the
scene
with
which
his
countenance
was
associated
in
her
mind
and
when
she
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
master
in
private
she
implored
him
to
resign
the
embassy
into
other
hands
and
not
thus
rashly
to
encounter
a
foe
whose
public
conduct
had
proved
him
to
be
unworthy
of
confidence
and
whose
expression
of
countenance
betokened
both
cruelty
and
treachery
but
all
her
arguments
were
unavailing
maitland
had
undertaken
the
charge
of
the
expedition
at
his
own
request
and
he
would
have
felt
himself
dishonored
in
now
declining
it
from
any
personal
motives
even
had
he
been
in
the
least
degree
inclined
to
do
so
on
the
contrary
his
spirit
was
roused
and
excited
by
the
very
perils
he
was
conscious
he
might
have
to
encounter
and
his
desire
to
obtain
and
convey
to
helen
some
intelligence
of
henrich
even
if
that
intelligence
should
still
for
ever
the
doubts
end
hopes
that
in
spite
of
every
past
circumstance
would
sometimes
arise
in
his
own
heart
and
that
of
his
own
wife
was
so
great
that
nothing
could
have
turned
him
from
his
purpose
he
therefore
desired
the
faithful
janet
to
preserve
the
same
silence
on
the
subject
of
coubitant
that
she
had
already
so
judiciously
adopted
towards
her
mistress
and
assured
her
that
he
would
neglect
no
precaution
that
might
preserve
him
from
the
treacherous
intentions
of
the
indian
should
any
such
be
actually
entertained
by
him
the
next
morning
rodolph
started
at
break
of
day
to
convey
the
reply
of
the
governor
to
the
narragansett
sachem
whose
tribe
inhabited
the
district
now
called
rhode
island
lying
to
the
of
new
plymouth
he
was
accompanied
by
two
friends
and
likewise
by
the
interpreter
squanto
his
faithful
dog
fingal
also
showed
such
a
strong
desire
to
follow
his
master
that
although
it
was
usual
custom
to
leave
him
at
home
as
a
guard
during
any
of
his
occasional
absences
when
his
services
in
hunting
were
not
required
he
could
not
in
this
instance
resist
his
eager
pleadings
helen
also
assured
him
that
she
should
feel
no
apprehension
at
being
deprived
of
her
usual
protector
as
no
danger
was
likely
to
menace
her
dwelling
and
the
increase
in
the
population
of
the
village
from
the
arrival
of
the
new
settlers
had
added
an
inmate
to
the
family
in
the
person
of
claude
felton
a
stout
young
laboring
man
who
had
become
the
useful
assistant
of
maitland
in
his
agricultural
occupations
and
proved
a
good
and
faithful
servant
to
his
protection
and
watchful
care
rodolph
maitland
committed
his
little
family
and
taking
a
cheerful
farewell
of
his
wife
and
edith
he
commenced
his
journey
through
the
wild
and
almost
trackless
woods
guided
by
squanto
the
party
reached
the
village
of
cundineus
and
were
received
into
the
presence
of
the
sachem
and
his
nephew
miantonomo
who
shared
with
him
the
cares
and
the
dignity
of
his
chieftainship
with
the
assistance
of
the
interpreter
rodolph
informed
the
chiefs
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
the
reply
of
the
mighty
strangers
to
the
bold
challenge
that
had
been
sent
to
them
on
the
part
of
cundineus
and
miantonomo
and
he
invited
them
to
open
the
packet
which
he
laid
before
them
in
order
that
they
might
fully
understand
the
nature
of
that
reply
and
judge
whether
the
subjects
of
the
powerful
king
of
great
britain
were
terrified
at
the
audacity
of
the
red
men
probably
squanto
made
some
additions
of
his
own
to
the
harangue
of
the
ambassador
for
a
very
ludicrous
change
of
expression
appeared
on
the
countenances
of
the
savage
chieftains
the
looks
of
fierce
defiance
with
which
they
had
received
the
embassy
gave
way
to
anxious
and
timid
glances
which
they
hastily
cast
at
the
ominous
while
they
involuntarily
drew
back
as
if
they
feared
it
would
explode
and
punish
their
rash
temerity
rodolph
saw
the
effect
of
squanto
version
of
his
speech
and
resolved
to
increase
it
he
understood
enough
of
the
native
tongue
to
perceive
that
the
interpreter
had
alluded
to
the
potent
and
deadly
properties
of
the
contents
of
the
and
he
desired
him
to
inform
the
chiefs
that
the
musket
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
contained
a
very
small
portion
of
the
same
substance
and
he
would
give
them
proof
of
its
power
he
then
glanced
for
a
moment
into
the
lofty
trees
that
surrounded
the
place
of
audience
and
perceiving
a
monkey
that
was
clinging
to
one
of
the
branches
nod
chattering
angrily
at
the
intrusive
foreigners
he
took
a
deliberate
aim
and
in
another
instant
the
creature
lay
lifeless
and
motionless
on
the
ground
the
indians
were
startled
at
the
report
and
amazed
at
the
effect
of
the
invisible
messenger
of
death
they
hastened
to
examine
the
dead
animal
but
one
drop
of
blood
issuing
from
its
skull
was
the
only
indication
that
some
missile
had
pierced
its
brain
and
the
veneration
of
the
narragansetts
and
their
chiefs
for
the
prowess
of
the
white
men
evidently
rose
in
a
great
degree
but
there
was
one
among
them
who
did
not
share
the
wonder
or
the
awe
of
the
assembly
he
stood
silent
and
motionless
at
a
little
distance
from
the
group
with
his
eyes
intently
fixed
on
rodolph
countenance
and
a
smile
of
malignant
scorn
and
triumph
on
his
own
dark
features
his
arms
were
folded
across
his
scarred
and
painted
breast
and
his
right
hand
grasped
the
handle
of
a
long
knife
that
was
stuck
into
his
deerskin
belt
the
action
seemed
to
be
involuntary
and
without
any
present
purpose
for
he
remained
in
the
same
position
unobserved
by
rodolph
until
he
and
his
attendants
had
retired
to
the
hut
appointed
them
by
cundineus
to
rest
and
refresh
themselves
end
await
the
reply
of
the
chief
rodolph
then
desired
squanto
to
make
inquiries
for
coubitant
and
if
possible
to
bring
him
to
the
hut
but
the
sagacious
interpreter
had
seen
and
recognized
the
white
face
and
he
earnestly
entreated
maitland
not
to
give
him
any
opportunity
of
executing
the
vengeance
which
was
evidently
burning
at
his
heart
and
ready
to
break
forth
in
some
deed
of
fatal
violence
rodolph
english
friends
also
joined
so
warmly
in
these
entreaties
that
he
at
length
consented
that
squanto
should
seek
the
savage
and
endeavor
to
draw
from
him
all
the
information
that
he
could
give
respecting
henrich
death
he
did
so
and
a
long
conversation
took
place
that
evening
the
result
of
which
was
that
he
assured
rodolph
that
his
son
had
indeed
been
murdered
in
the
wood
as
he
had
always
supposed
and
that
his
scalp
had
been
torn
off
even
before
life
was
extinct
whilst
his
body
had
been
conveyed
to
the
next
encampment
and
burned
with
many
heathen
rites
to
appease
the
troubled
spirit
of
tisquantum
son
tekoa
the
father
shuddered
and
turned
away
to
hide
the
rising
tear
as
he
listened
to
this
harrowing
but
false
account
he
however
fully
believed
it
and
felt
that
henceforth
it
would
be
vain
to
cherish
any
hope
concerning
his
son
except
that
blessed
hope
which
is
the
privilege
of
the
christian
the
sure
and
certain
hope
of
meeting
hereafter
in
the
presence
of
the
god
and
savior
in
whom
he
had
taught
his
child
to
place
his
trust
he
said
no
more
he
did
not
even
question
squanto
as
to
the
cause
of
his
having
spent
so
long
a
time
in
conferring
with
coubitant
when
all
the
information
he
had
obtained
amounted
merely
to
the
sad
assurance
that
his
son
had
suffered
a
dreadful
death
had
he
done
so
the
interpreter
might
have
found
it
difficult
to
account
for
his
conduct
as
he
had
professed
a
strong
dislike
to
coubitant
and
a
distrust
of
all
his
motives
and
actions
the
fact
was
that
the
wily
savage
had
discovered
squanto
love
of
importance
and
his
desire
to
be
supposed
to
possess
the
confidence
of
the
white
men
and
by
flattering
his
vanity
he
had
drawn
from
him
all
the
information
he
could
give
with
respect
to
the
strength
of
the
settlers
and
their
capability
of
resisting
an
attack
of
the
natives
squanto
took
care
to
exaggerate
the
numbers
and
the
power
of
his
employers
but
still
it
appeared
to
coubitant
that
if
he
could
once
more
induce
the
neighboring
tribes
to
combine
and
invade
their
territory
there
was
every
probability
of
their
being
utterly
exterminated
and
nothing
short
of
this
could
satisfy
the
feeling
of
hatred
that
he
entertained
towards
the
whole
race
of
the
strangers
by
way
of
exalting
the
might
of
the
settlers
in
the
minds
of
the
native
squanto
assured
coubitant
that
the
white
men
kept
the
plague
of
which
the
indians
well
knew
the
desolating
effects
imprisoned
in
a
cellar
where
they
also
stowed
their
gunpowder
and
that
they
could
let
it
loose
upon
their
foes
at
their
pleasure
this
strange
evidence
was
heard
also
by
miantonomo
whom
coubitant
called
to
join
the
conference
as
he
knew
that
he
already
hated
the
english
and
he
desired
to
strengthen
that
feeling
to
the
utmost
for
the
furtherance
of
his
own
plans
from
coubitant
squanto
also
received
some
intelligence
which
in
the
minds
both
of
the
superstitious
interpreter
and
his
heathen
informant
was
of
vital
importance
to
the
settlers
and
calculated
to
inspire
them
with
dread
this
was
the
awful
fact
that
a
short
time
previous
several
of
the
neighboring
tribes
had
met
in
the
adjacent
forest
and
that
the
powows
of
the
whole
district
had
passed
three
days
and
nights
in
cursing
the
strangers
and
uttering
against
them
the
most
horrible
imprecations
the
effect
of
this
diabolical
proceeding
in
causing
the
defeat
of
their
foes
coubitant
did
not
do
not
and
in
spite
of
his
veneration
for
the
english
and
his
conviction
that
their
deities
were
more
powerful
than
the
indian
demons
squanto
was
filled
with
apprehensions
on
their
account
he
communicated
the
circumstance
to
rodolph
and
was
surprised
and
almost
offended
at
the
smile
of
indifference
and
contempt
with
which
the
christian
listened
to
him
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
make
him
attach
any
importance
to
what
seemed
to
him
so
serious
a
calamity
and
by
degrees
his
own
fears
subsided
and
his
mind
was
reassured
by
the
arguments
and
the
cool
composure
of
maitland
rodolph
and
his
companions
lay
down
to
rest
for
the
night
in
the
indian
hut
across
the
entrance
of
which
squanto
placed
several
strong
boughs
and
spread
a
cloak
of
over
them
this
was
done
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
out
the
cold
night
wind
but
really
to
serve
as
a
screen
from
the
prying
eyes
of
coubitant
whose
intentions
he
much
mistrusted
and
also
as
an
obstacle
to
any
attempt
he
might
possibly
make
to
violate
the
laws
of
honor
and
hospitality
by
a
secret
attack
on
the
person
of
the
ambassador
whether
the
savage
actually
meditated
any
such
act
of
treachery
was
not
known
but
if
he
approached
the
hut
with
a
murderous
purpose
he
was
probably
deterred
more
by
the
fierce
growlings
of
fingal
who
lay
at
the
entrance
but
scarcely
slept
that
night
than
by
the
barrier
of
boughs
and
deerskin
several
times
were
the
party
awakened
by
the
trusty
angry
bark
and
once
when
rodolph
hastened
to
the
entrance
and
drew
aside
the
curtain
he
thought
he
could
descry
more
than
one
retreating
figure
in
the
uncertain
darkness
the
continued
uneasiness
of
fingal
prevented
his
master
from
again
giving
way
to
sleep
until
after
day
had
dawned
when
his
faithful
guard
became
tranquil
and
he
likewise
sought
the
repose
which
he
greatly
needed
before
recommencing
his
fatiguing
journey
ere
he
set
out
on
his
homeward
way
rodolph
again
repaired
with
squanto
to
the
presence
of
the
chief
to
demand
his
message
to
the
british
governor
and
he
was
informed
by
cundincus
that
he
had
already
dispatched
a
messenger
to
restore
the
dreaded
packet
and
to
deprecate
the
wrath
of
the
chieftain
this
was
all
the
ambassador
could
desire
and
taking
a
courteous
leave
of
the
sachem
he
and
his
attendants
resumed
their
journey
without
further
delay
for
a
considerable
distance
their
path
lay
through
the
forest
and
the
underwood
was
so
close
and
thick
that
the
road
consisted
of
a
narrow
track
scarcely
wider
than
would
admit
of
two
persons
passing
one
another
along
it
and
only
calculated
for
travelling
in
file
which
is
so
much
practiced
by
the
natives
in
this
manner
our
party
proceeded
rodolph
leading
the
way
and
his
attendants
following
singly
while
fingal
who
seemed
rejoiced
to
have
left
the
village
bounded
along
at
his
master
side
ever
and
anon
leaping
up
to
express
his
joy
by
licking
his
face
and
hands
fingal
said
his
master
kindly
patting
his
favorite
head
and
stroking
his
thick
shaggy
mane
my
good
fellow
your
joy
is
too
boisterous
for
this
narrow
thorny
path
you
shall
expend
your
superfluous
strength
and
spirits
on
the
plain
yonder
for
i
think
i
detect
some
game
scudding
across
the
green
meadow
before
us
rodolph
paused
to
adjust
his
gun
and
the
sagacious
dog
ceased
his
wild
demonstrations
end
paused
also
until
the
task
was
completed
then
as
his
master
rose
to
proceed
he
once
more
sprang
up
to
his
shoulder
end
his
intelligent
eyes
asked
leave
to
dash
through
the
covert
and
drive
out
the
expected
game
but
why
did
that
bound
of
pleasure
change
instantaneously
into
a
convulsion
of
agony
and
why
did
the
noble
creature
fall
by
his
master
side
and
look
so
earnestly
up
into
his
face
surely
in
the
midst
of
his
own
death
struggle
he
sought
to
tell
him
with
that
mute
eloquence
of
love
that
danger
was
near
rodolph
knew
that
it
was
so
but
no
danger
could
then
have
compelled
him
to
leave
his
dying
friend
the
friend
whose
life
was
now
ebbing
away
as
a
sacrifice
for
his
own
yes
the
shaft
that
had
pierced
through
the
neck
of
fingal
was
designed
for
rodolph
breast
and
he
who
cast
it
deemed
that
it
had
found
its
intended
mark
when
through
the
bushes
he
saw
the
white
man
form
bend
quickly
and
suddenly
to
the
ground
then
coubitant
fled
exultingly
and
his
savage
heart
beat
high
with
joy
and
triumph
but
rodolph
thought
not
of
him
or
of
his
malice
he
only
saw
his
faithful
dog
expiring
at
his
side
and
knew
that
he
had
no
power
to
aid
him
it
was
evident
that
the
arrow
was
poisoned
for
the
wound
otherwise
appeared
too
slight
to
be
mortal
and
the
foam
that
gathered
on
fingal
jaws
and
the
convulsive
struggle
that
shook
his
form
showed
too
plainly
that
his
sufferings
would
soon
be
over
the
companions
of
rodolph
urged
him
to
join
them
in
instant
flight
for
they
felt
the
peril
of
their
present
situation
where
the
surrounding
thicket
gave
such
ample
opportunity
to
their
lurking
foes
to
take
a
deadly
aim
while
at
the
same
time
it
prevented
them
from
either
discovering
or
pursuing
their
assailants
but
all
their
arguments
and
all
their
entreaties
were
unavailing
so
long
as
fingal
continued
to
lick
his
master
caressing
hand
and
to
reply
to
his
voice
by
looks
of
intelligent
affection
soon
however
his
head
sank
powerless
on
rodolph
knee
and
the
bright
glance
of
his
eye
faded
away
and
life
and
motion
ceased
was
it
unmanly
in
his
master
to
brush
a
tear
from
his
eye
as
he
rose
from
the
ground
and
turned
away
one
moment
from
the
lifeless
form
of
his
favorite
will
not
leave
him
here
he
said
savages
shall
not
mangle
his
body
as
they
would
gladly
have
mangled
mine
his
death
has
saved
my
life
and
all
that
remains
of
him
shall
be
carried
to
a
place
of
safety
and
buried
beyond
the
reach
of
those
who
slew
him
replied
squanto
readily
for
he
desired
the
removal
of
the
dog
from
that
spot
for
other
reasons
beside
the
gratification
of
maitland
feelings
yes
we
will
carry
him
away
and
hide
him
from
eyes
doubtless
he
will
return
here
as
soon
as
all
is
quiet
to
see
the
success
of
his
murderous
attempt
and
when
he
finds
the
path
thus
stained
with
blood
he
will
be
satisfied
and
pursue
us
no
further
than
to
see
whether
we
bury
our
dead
companion
in
the
forest
or
bear
him
to
his
home
we
must
therefore
carry
fingal
all
the
way
to
new
plymouth
lest
he
should
follow
on
our
trail
and
discover
that
he
has
only
slain
a
rodolph
english
companions
concurred
in
this
view
and
willingly
lent
their
aid
to
convey
the
body
of
fingal
from
the
place
of
his
death
a
couple
of
poles
were
cut
hastily
and
a
rude
light
litter
was
formed
for
squanto
wished
that
coubitant
should
find
traces
of
such
preparations
as
they
would
help
to
convince
him
that
they
had
thus
borne
away
the
wounded
or
dead
form
of
the
ambassador
said
he
when
all
was
ready
another
moment
must
be
lost
even
now
the
keen
eye
of
the
foe
may
be
upon
us
and
our
stratagem
may
be
in
vain
two
of
you
must
bear
the
litter
and
must
carefully
place
your
feet
in
the
same
spot
so
as
to
form
but
one
track
and
lead
our
pursuers
to
believe
that
only
three
men
have
passed
along
and
there
throw
that
bloody
handkerchief
on
the
path
and
coubitant
will
take
it
as
a
trophy
of
success
he
exclaimed
as
rodolph
and
one
of
his
friends
were
about
to
raise
the
lifeless
form
of
fingal
from
the
ground
one
moment
and
i
will
completely
deceive
that
deceiver
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
for
he
felt
it
a
pleasure
and
a
triumph
to
outwit
the
wily
coubitant
then
while
the
body
of
the
dog
was
supported
he
carefully
pressed
his
feet
on
the
soft
path
so
as
to
leave
a
distinct
impression
and
convince
any
who
should
examine
the
trail
that
it
was
not
the
dog
who
had
been
wounded
this
cunning
device
he
practiced
again
and
again
until
they
had
passed
through
the
wood
and
entered
the
grassy
meadow
where
such
precautions
were
no
longer
needed
then
the
party
quickened
their
steps
and
paused
not
again
until
they
had
struck
deeply
into
the
forest
that
succeeded
to
the
undulating
reach
of
meadowland
the
way
seemed
long
to
rodolph
he
desired
to
reach
his
cherished
home
and
yet
he
dreaded
to
return
and
sadden
the
heart
of
his
little
edith
with
the
story
of
fingal
death
and
the
sight
of
the
inanimate
form
of
her
last
and
playfellow
had
it
not
been
for
this
catastrophe
he
would
have
kept
from
his
wife
and
child
the
knowledge
of
the
cruel
attempt
that
had
been
made
on
his
life
as
such
knowledge
could
only
distress
them
and
cause
them
needless
anxiety
and
alarm
in
future
but
the
death
of
fingal
must
be
accounted
for
and
let
the
consequence
be
what
it
might
it
must
be
accounted
for
truly
and
without
prevarication
therefore
it
was
that
rodolph
dreaded
meeting
those
whose
presence
was
the
joy
and
the
sunlight
of
his
life
he
reached
his
home
and
silently
entered
his
blooming
garden
and
with
squanto
assistance
laid
the
body
of
fingal
now
cold
and
stiff
beneath
the
venerable
tree
that
shaded
edith
bower
then
he
entered
his
dwelling
and
found
its
inmates
busily
employed
at
their
usual
domestic
occupations
and
overjoyed
at
his
sudden
and
unexpected
arrival
but
in
spite
of
his
own
pleasure
a
shade
of
sadness
and
anxiety
was
on
his
brow
which
he
could
not
hide
from
the
quick
eye
of
helen
and
she
eagerly
inquired
the
cause
sadly
rodolph
told
his
story
and
joy
and
deep
gratitude
for
the
preservation
of
her
beloved
husband
so
filled
and
engrossed
the
heart
of
helen
as
for
a
time
to
overpower
every
feeling
of
regret
for
the
loss
of
the
faithful
animal
who
seemed
to
have
been
providentially
directed
to
accompany
his
master
and
save
his
life
at
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
but
edith
keenly
felt
the
loss
she
had
sustained
she
was
thankful
very
thankful
that
her
father
had
been
restored
to
their
home
in
safety
but
she
did
not
the
less
deplore
the
death
of
her
dear
companion
and
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
she
hurried
from
the
house
and
ran
to
hide
her
grief
in
her
lonely
bower
for
some
time
her
parents
did
not
perceive
her
absence
for
they
were
occupied
with
their
own
feelings
of
pious
gratitude
but
presently
rodolph
remarked
that
she
had
left
the
room
and
remembered
where
he
had
deposited
the
body
of
her
favorite
he
rose
and
went
towards
the
spot
accompanied
by
helen
and
tears
of
sorrowful
sympathy
arose
in
the
eyes
of
both
as
they
beheld
the
desolate
child
lying
on
the
ground
by
side
with
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
her
long
waving
hair
hanging
over
his
inanimate
face
that
had
never
before
met
her
gaze
without
an
answering
look
of
intelligence
and
affection
gently
they
raised
her
and
spoke
to
her
words
of
love
and
comfort
but
she
long
refused
to
be
comforted
and
though
at
length
she
became
calm
and
resigned
and
never
was
heard
to
utter
one
murmur
at
this
fresh
stroke
of
sorrow
yet
her
pensive
sadness
became
more
confirmed
and
plainly
showed
that
she
mourned
for
fingal
not
only
as
her
lost
companion
but
also
as
a
connecting
link
between
her
own
heart
and
the
memory
of
her
lamented
brother
poor
edith
her
early
life
was
one
of
trial
and
disappointment
but
was
good
for
her
to
be
afflicted

relations
with

which
after
the
first
natural
distrust

natives
towards

had

they
were
in
several
instances
able

but
such

not

they
received

from

from

who
professed
to
be
most
friendly
towards
them

also
from
the

who
followed
them
from

whom
they
were

even
masasoyt
their
friend
and
ally
was
about
this
time
nearly
estranged
from
them
and
on
the
point
of
joining
the
narragansetts
in
a
project
for
their
destruction
this
change
in
his
sentiments
was
the
result
of
the
machinations
of
coubitant
assisted
by
the
foolish
pretensions
and
love
of
interference
which
rendered
squanto
almost
as
dangerous
as
he
was
useful
to
his
employers
his
boasting
tales
about
the
power
of
the
english
settlers
to
imprison
and
to
let
loose
the
desolating
plague
at
their
will
and
pleasure
had
been
told
to
the
sagamore
of
the
wampanoges
as
well
as
to
coubitant
and
miantonomo
and
suspicions
had
arisen
in
the
breast
of
masasoyt
which
he
vainly
strove
to
infuse
into
his
more
enlightened
and
trustworthy
son
mooanam
nothing
that
his
father
could
say
had
any
effect
in
weakening
the
friendship
entertained
by
the
young
sachem
and
his
brother
quadequina
towards
the
emigrants
and
it
was
owing
to
this
steady
friendship
that
they
were
made
acquainted
with
the
altered
feelings
of
the
sagamore
in
time
to
prevent
their
ripening
into
open
hostility
mooanam
communicated
to
the
president
the
doubts
and
suspicions
that
had
taken
possession
of
his
father
mind
and
advised
him
immediately
to
send
the
faithful
and
devoted
hobomak
to
packanokick
to
endeavor
to
remove
the
evil
impression
and
restore
his
confidence
in
the
pilgrim
fathers
he
also
convinced
both
bradford
and
his
council
that
the
conspiracy
which
squanto
had
represented
as
already
formed
and
only
waiting
the
concurrence
of
masasoyt
to
be
carried
into
deadly
effect
was
as
yet
in
its
infancy
and
might
by
judicious
management
be
altogether
broken
up
the
pokanokit
interpreter
had
greatly
exaggerated
in
his
report
to
the
governor
all
that
he
had
heard
from
coubitant
while
at
the
narragansett
village
and
had
persuaded
him
in
spite
of
the
opinion
expressed
by
rodolph
to
believe
not
only
that
he
and
his
people
had
been
cursed
by
the
powows
but
also
that
the
tribes
to
which
these
satanic
conjurors
belonged
were
uniting
for
the
common
purpose
of
attacking
and
destroying
the
british
settlement
all
this
was
done
by
squanto
with
no
serious
intention
of
injuring
his
new
friends
but
from
a
vain
desire
to
make
himself
important
and
show
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
and
sagacity
his
vanity
was
however
very
near
proving
fatal
to
him
for
when
the
trusty
hobomak
had
explained
to
the
sagamore
the
real
motives
and
intentions
of
the
settlers
towards
the
natives
and
had
convinced
him
that
all
the
strange
and
mysterious
stories
that
squanto
delighted
to
tell
were
either
pure
inventions
or
gross
exaggerations
a
second
change
was
effected
in
the
old
feelings
and
he
sent
to
demand
that
the
faithless
interpreter
should
be
immediately
delivered
up
to
him
the
governor
was
extremely
reluctant
to
comply
with
this
demand
as
he
well
knew
how
cruel
and
how
summary
were
the
judgements
of
the
native
chiefs
and
he
as
well
as
the
whole
of
the
colony
felt
a
regard
for
squanto
notwithstanding
his
folly
and
his
errors
nevertheless
the
pokanokit
was
a
subject
of
the
sagamore
who
had
made
an
express
stipulation
in
his
treaty
with
the
settlers
that
any
of
his
people
who
might
take
up
their
abode
in
the
colony
should
be
given
up
to
him
whenever
he
required
it
and
therefore
bradford
felt
himself
compelled
to
abandon
squanto
to
his
fate
the
messengers
who
accompanied
hobomak
on
his
return
to
new
plymouth
were
loaded
with
a
quantity
of
valuable
which
they
laid
in
a
pile
at
the
governor
feet
as
a
bribe
to
induce
him
to
comply
with
masasoyt
demand
these
the
governor
rejected
with
indignant
scorn
observing
that
no
man
life
could
be
purchased
from
the
english
and
that
if
he
resigned
the
interpreter
into
the
power
of
his
native
sovereign
it
was
only
because
truth
and
justice
required
it
and
not
from
any
base
motives
either
of
fear
or
advantage
then
the
messengers
approached
the
wretched
man
who
stood
calmly
awaiting
the
decision
of
the
governor
and
he
saw
one
of
them
draw
from
his
belt
the
knife
that
masasoyt
had
commanded
him
to
plunge
into
the
culprit
heart
but
squanto
did
not
tremble
all
the
native
fortitude
so
characteristic
of
his
race
was
manifested
in
this
awful
moment
and
the
bystanders
felt
a
respect
for
the
pokanokit
that
he
had
never
before
inspired
gladly
would
each
individual
have
interposed
to
save
him
and
breathlessly
they
watched
the
movements
of
the
president
whose
signal
was
to
fix
the
moment
of
squanto
death
bradford
hesitated
the
word
trembled
on
his
lips
when
suddenly
looking
towards
the
sea
from
the
summit
of
burying
hill
on
which
the
assembly
stood
he
espied
a
shallop
bounding
over
the
waves
and
advancing
directly
towards
the
shore
beneath
he
made
this
a
pretext
certainly
not
a
very
well
grounded
delaying
the
execution
of
squanto
sentence
and
declared
that
he
would
not
give
the
fatal
signal
until
he
had
ascertained
the
object
and
the
contents
of
the
approaching
vessel
this
faltering
on
the
part
of
the
governor
excited
great
wrath
in
the
messengers
of
masasoyt
and
without
any
farther
parley
they
took
up
their
beaver
skins
and
departed
to
their
home
squanto
forfeited
life
was
thus
providentially
spared
and
the
conduct
of
bradford
was
through
mooanam
good
offices
overlooked
b
the
sagamore
but
that
life
was
not
greatly
prolonged
very
soon
after
this
event
he
was
seized
with
i
virulent
fever
while
on
a
short
journey
with
the
governor
and
in
spite
of
all
the
care
and
attention
that
were
bestowed
on
him
he
died
much
regretted
by
the
whole
colony
the
boat
whose
seasonable
approach
had
been
the
means
of
arresting
the
fatal
stroke
was
found
to
have
been
sent
from
some
english
fishing
vessels
many
of
which
now
constantly
frequented
the
shores
of
new
england
it
conveyed
to
the
colony
an
addition
of
several
men
who
were
joyfully
welcomed
by
the
settlers
as
laborers
were
just
then
much
wanted
both
in
the
fields
and
in
the
increasing
town
these
men
were
sent
out
by
an
english
merchant
named
weston
who
had
long
endeavored
to
encourage
the
colonization
of
new
england
but
from
very
different
motives
to
those
which
had
actuated
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
led
them
to
forsake
the
comforts
of
a
european
home
for
the
toils
and
uncertainties
of
an
american
wilderness
a
desire
for
profit
appears
to
have
been
the
ruling
principle
in
weston
mind
he
was
therefore
very
indifferent
as
to
the
moral
character
of
the
men
whom
he
sent
out
to
join
the
emigrants
and
was
only
solicitous
to
secure
a
quick
return
of
the
money
that
he
had
expended
and
finding
that
the
prospect
of
gain
from
a
connection
with
the
new
plymouthers
was
doubtful
and
tardy
he
had
resolved
to
found
a
colony
himself
for
this
purpose
he
had
some
time
previously
obtained
a
grant
of
a
portion
of
land
in
massachusetts
and
sent
over
sixty
men
to
cultivate
it
in
two
ships
which
he
placed
under
the
command
of
his
law
the
arrival
of
this
fresh
band
of
emigrants
had
proved
a
fruitful
source
of
trouble
and
annoyance
to
the
first
settlers
for
they
were
chiefly
idle
and
profligate
vagabonds
who
had
no
settled
occupation
at
home
and
no
characters
to
sustain
weston
himself
described
them
in
a
letter
to
bradford
as
rude
and
profane
and
a
friend
of
the
pilgrims
wrote
from
england
to
warn
them
against
having
any
connection
with
the
new
colony
and
recommended
them
to
have
it
distinctly
explained
to
the
indians
that
they
were
a
new
and
independent
society
for
whose
conduct
and
good
faith
they
could
in
no
way
be
responsible
notwithstanding
all
these
warnings
and
the
very
unprepossessing
appearance
of
the
new
emigrants
the
plymouthers
had
shown
more
kindness
and
hospitality
than
they
had
prudence
and
caution
and
had
received
their
countrymen
into
their
own
settlement
on
their
arrival
in
america
they
had
even
permitted
on
half
of
their
number
to
reside
at
new
plymouth
during
the
whole
summer
while
the
strongest
and
healthiest
had
proceeded
to
massachusetts
to
fix
on
a
spot
for
their
settlement
and
prepare
habitations
they
had
decided
on
a
place
called
wessagussett
a
little
to
the
south
of
boston
and
thither
they
were
afterwards
followed
by
their
companions
from
new
plymouth
the
long
residence
of
these
men
among
the
pious
and
pilgrims
had
not
however
made
any
salutary
impression
on
their
minds
and
all
the
kindness
and
hospitality
they
had
received
were
most
ungratefully
forgotten
footnote
new
weymouth
in
various
ways
the
new
colony
vexed
and
annoyed
the
men
of
plymouth
but
in
no
way
more
seriously
than
by
their
conduct
towards
the
natives
which
was
so
different
to
the
just
and
upright
dealings
of
the
pilgrims
that
the
indians
began
to
lose
their
confidence
in
the
white
men
and
to
suspect
deceit
and
imposition
where
hitherto
they
had
only
found
truth
and
justice
weston
colony
was
indeed
scarcely
settled
at
wessagussett
before
complaints
were
sent
by
the
indians
to
their
friends
at
plymouth
of
the
repeated
depredations
that
were
committed
by
the
new
settlers
who
were
continually
carrying
off
their
stores
of
corn
and
other
property
and
these
accusations
were
by
no
means
surprising
to
bradford
and
his
council
as
they
had
already
detected
them
in
many
acts
of
theft
during
their
stay
at
new
plymouth
the
harvest
of
this
year
was
poor
and
scanty
and
the
great
accession
to
their
numbers
caused
by
the
visit
of
weston
settlers
had
entirely
consumed
the
stores
of
the
plymouthers
and
reduced
them
again
to
actual
want
joyfully
therefore
they
hailed
the
arrival
of
two
ships
from
the
mother
country
laden
with
knives
beads
and
various
other
articles
that
would
be
acceptable
to
the
indians
in
the
way
of
barter
and
enable
the
settlers
to
purchase
from
them
the
necessary
supply
of
provisions
for
which
they
had
hitherto
been
compelled
to
pay
very
dear
in
skins
and
furs
meanwhile
the
colony
of
wessagussett
was
in
a
still
worse
condition
they
had
quickly
consumed
all
the
food
with
which
the
generous
plymouthers
had
supplied
them
and
had
then
stolen
everything
on
which
they
could
lay
their
hands
they
had
also
sold
almost
all
their
clothes
and
bedding
and
even
their
weapons
and
were
brought
to
such
extreme
necessity
that
they
did
not
refuse
to
do
the
meanest
services
for
the
indians
who
dwelt
near
their
settlement
in
return
for
such
means
of
subsistence
as
the
red
men
were
able
to
furnish
them
with
for
this
condescension
so
unlike
the
dignified
yet
kind
deportment
of
the
plymouthers
the
natives
despised
them
and
treated
them
with
contempt
and
even
violence
thus
early
was
the
british
name
brought
into
disrepute
with
the
indians
when
men
bearing
that
name
came
among
them
for
mere
purposes
of
speculation
and
profit
and
ware
not
governed
by
the
christian
principles
of
humanity
and
justice
that
distinguished
the
earliest
settlers
in
new
england
from
all
those
who
followed
them
nor
did
the
evil
consequences
of
their
ill
conduct
rest
with
themselves
they
fell
also
on
the
colony
of
plymouth
and
were
the
means
of
involving
them
in
hostilities
with
the
natives
which
had
hitherto
been
warded
off
by
the
kind
and
judicious
management
of
the
governor
and
his
assistants
the
general
state
of
peace
which
had
up
to
this
period
been
maintained
with
the
indians
was
greatly
to
be
attributed
to
the
bold
and
decisive
measures
that
were
always
adopted
by
miles
standish
the
military
chief
of
the
little
community
and
the
leader
of
every
warlike
expedition
he
well
knew
how
to
impress
the
natives
with
a
due
respect
for
he
never
tolerated
the
slightest
injury
or
insult
and
yet
he
never
permitted
his
men
to
be
guilty
of
any
act
of
injustice
or
oppression
towards
the
red
men
since
the
arrival
of
weston
disorderly
colony
captain
standish
had
shown
himself
even
more
decided
in
maintaining
the
rights
and
the
dignity
of
the
plymouthers
and
had
endeavored
to
show
the
natives
that
they
were
not
to
identify
the
new
comers
with
those
whom
they
had
already
learnt
to
know
and
to
respect
but
at
length
in
spite
of
all
these
judicious
measures
the
pilgrims
were
drawn
into
the
quarrel
that
subsisted
between
their
countrymen
of
wessagussett
and
the
natives
and
having
drawn
the
sword
they
certainly
forgot
the
principles
of
mercy
and
humanity
that
had
hitherto
guided
them
active
measures
were
undoubtedly
called
for
but
cruelty
and
stratagem
were
unworthy
of
these
christian
warriors
the
continued
marauding
expeditions
of
the
men
of
wessagussett
had
exasperated
the
neighboring
tribes
to
the
last
degree
and
the
state
of
weakness
to
which
they
were
reduced
by
their
own
thoughtless
and
improvident
conduct
led
the
natives
to
suppose
that
they
would
fall
an
easy
prey
to
their
combined
force
they
therefore
again
formed
a
combination
to
attack
and
utterly
destroy
these
oppressive
intruders
into
their
country
probably
the
council
of
chiefs
who
met
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
to
arrange
their
plan
of
operations
would
have
contented
themselves
with
contriving
the
destruction
of
the
new
and
offending
colony
which
they
might
easily
have
effected
had
they
confined
their
projected
operations
to
that
object
alone
but
there
was
one
in
the
council
who
could
not
rest
satisfied
with
such
a
partial
vengeance
on
the
white
strangers
and
his
fiery
eloquence
and
false
assertions
and
insinuations
prevailed
over
the
rest
of
the
chiefs
to
disregard
every
treaty
and
every
obligation
that
ought
to
have
bound
them
to
the
settlers
of
new
plymouth
and
to
include
them
also
in
their
savage
scheme
of
massacre
and
plunder
the
argument
by
which
he
finally
overcame
the
scruples
of
those
chiefs
who
had
allied
themselves
with
the
first
emigrants
and
had
acquired
a
regard
and
respect
for
them
was
one
of
he
boldly
asserted
that
the
men
of
new
plymouth
would
never
either
pardon
or
forget
the
destruction
of
their
countrymen
of
wessagussett
but
would
immediately
lay
aside
the
mask
of
kindness
and
forbearance
with
which
they
had
hitherto
concealed
their
undoubted
project
of
acquiring
the
dominion
of
the
whole
country
and
gradually
destroying
the
red
men
and
would
call
forth
all
their
supernatural
powers
and
blast
them
with
fire
and
plague
unless
they
were
taken
by
surprise
and
annihilated
at
one
fell
swoop
all
the
superstitious
fears
of
the
ignorant
natives
were
thus
aroused
and
if
there
were
any
in
the
assembly
who
were
too
well
acquainted
with
the
white
men
to
credit
all
that
coubitant
asserted
they
thought
it
either
unsafe
or
unwise
to
express
their
opinions
any
further
happily
for
the
settlers
one
such
faithful
and
friendly
spirit
was
there
to
watch
for
their
interests
and
provide
for
their
preservation
masasoyt
had
resumed
all
his
kindly
feelings
towards
his
english
allies
since
the
misunderstanding
occasioned
by
squanto
meddling
propensities
had
been
explained
away
by
the
trusty
hobomak
he
had
also
recently
been
visited
by
edward
winslow
when
he
was
afflicted
with
a
severe
illness
and
the
christian
soldier
had
ministered
to
his
relief
in
a
way
that
had
excited
both
the
wonder
and
the
lively
gratitude
of
the
sagamore
when
therefore
he
obeyed
the
summons
of
coubitant
to
join
the
general
council
of
chiefs
he
had
no
intention
of
consenting
to
any
hostile
measures
being
undertaken
against
his
powerful
and
beneficent
friends
weston
wild
and
disorderly
crew
had
excited
his
anger
in
common
with
that
of
all
the
other
neighboring
sachems
and
he
was
quite
willing
to
combine
with
his
red
brethren
for
their
chastisement
perhaps
even
for
their
utter
destruction
but
he
did
not
confound
the
pilgrim
fathers
who
had
never
failed
in
truth
and
honesty
with
the
deceitful
and
marauding
vagabonds
who
wore
white
faces
and
called
themselves
christian
subjects
of
king
james
while
they
acted
like
heathen
savages
at
first
masasoyt
met
the
malignant
arguments
and
false
assertions
of
coubitant
with
an
open
and
generous
statement
of
the
upright
conduct
of
the
strangers
towards
himself
and
his
tribe
during
the
three
years
of
their
residence
in
new
england
and
urged
the
assembled
chiefs
to
beware
how
they
attempted
to
molest
men
whose
power
to
resist
and
punish
any
such
attempt
was
only
equaled
by
their
willingness
and
ability
to
benefit
those
who
treated
them
with
confidence
and
integrity
but
he
soon
perceived
that
his
arguments
in
favor
of
mercy
and
justice
were
powerless
when
opposed
to
the
fierce
and
crafty
harangues
of
coubitant
and
he
therefore
forbore
to
make
any
further
reply
and
even
appeared
to
acquiesce
in
the
decision
of
the
council
that
the
only
means
of
securing
the
safety
and
independence
of
the
indian
tribes
was
utterly
to
exterminate
the
invaders
the
proposed
plan
for
accomplishing
this
barbarous
project
was
first
to
surround
and
fall
on
the
miserable
and
sickly
colony
of
wessagussett
and
then
before
the
news
of
the
massacre
could
reach
new
plymouth
to
hasten
thither
and
wreak
on
its
unsuspecting
and
unprepared
inhabitants
the
same
fierce
vengeance
the
day
and
hour
were
fixed
and
every
necessary
preliminary
was
minutely
arranged
and
then
the
council
broke
up
and
the
chiefs
returned
to
their
respective
dwellings
to
collect
and
fully
arm
their
followers
and
prepare
to
meet
again
at
the
appointed
time
and
place
with
both
hands
and
hearts
read
to
execute
the
bloody
deed
masasoyt
retired
like
the
rest
and
attended
by
the
little
band
of
warriors
who
formed
his
bodyguard
be
took
the
forest
path
that
led
to
his
dwelling
at
packanokick
but
he
did
not
long
pursue
that
path
when
he
had
proceeded
such
a
distance
through
the
forest
as
to
feel
sure
that
he
should
not
by
turning
to
the
right
cross
the
route
of
any
of
the
other
chiefs
he
dismissed
all
his
followers
except
two
of
the
most
trusty
and
confidential
the
rest
he
desired
to
proceed
immediately
to
packanokick
and
inform
his
people
that
they
must
prepare
for
a
warlike
expedition
and
that
he
was
going
to
visit
his
son
mooanam
in
order
to
give
him
directions
to
join
in
the
enterprise
with
that
portion
of
the
tribe
that
was
under
his
authority
this
was
very
far
from
being
the
truth
but
the
indian
sagamore
considered
that
every
falsehood
and
stratagem
was
allowable
and
even
meritorious
that
could
further
a
desired
object
especially
if
that
object
was
so
undoubtedly
good
in
itself
as
that
which
now
engrossed
his
thoughts
and
wishes
he
did
not
know
that
it
is
sin
to
evil
that
good
may
and
therefore
we
must
judge
him
by
his
generous
motives
and
not
by
his
heathen
practice
having
thus
freed
himself
from
those
on
whose
discretion
and
fidelity
he
could
not
fully
rely
he
changed
his
course
and
traveled
straight
towards
new
plymouth
there
was
no
beaten
track
through
the
tangled
woods
in
that
direction
but
the
position
of
the
sun
and
the
appearance
of
the
trees
were
sufficient
guides
for
the
sagacious
indian
chief
and
in
spite
of
his
advanced
age
he
pursued
his
way
with
vigor
and
activity
frequently
his
path
was
obstructed
by
the
luxuriant
growth
of
underwood
or
by
the
creepers
that
hung
in
every
direction
crossing
each
other
like
the
rigging
of
a
ship
and
presenting
obstacles
that
nothing
but
the
tomahawks
that
hung
from
the
girdles
of
the
natives
enabled
them
to
overcome
with
these
weapons
ever
ready
in
the
hand
of
an
indian
either
to
cut
his
way
through
the
forest
to
fell
the
timbers
for
his
wigwam
or
his
canoe
to
slay
the
game
that
his
arrows
have
brought
to
the
ground
or
to
cleave
the
skull
of
his
enemy
did
old
masasoyt
and
his
devoted
followers
divide
the
large
tough
climbing
plants
that
obstructed
their
passage
sometimes
also
when
the
sun
was
totally
obscured
and
the
necessary
windings
in
their
course
would
hive
rendered
them
uncertain
whether
they
were
following
the
right
direction
these
useful
tomahawks
enabled
them
to
consult
the
indian
compass
the
manner
in
which
these
children
of
the
wilderness
supply
to
themselves
the
want
of
that
invaluable
instrument
is
both
curious
and
ingenious
and
it
proved
of
essential
use
to
the
wampanoge
chief
on
this
occasion
whenever
he
found
himself
at
fault
from
the
absence
of
the
sun
or
any
other
direct
indication
of
the
proper
course
he
raised
his
and
struck
a
heavy
blow
at
some
neighboring
pine
or
birch
tree
on
each
side
of
which
he
cut
a
deep
notch
and
then
by
examining
the
grain
of
the
wood
he
could
tell
which
was
the
north
and
which
the
south
side
the
former
being
easily
ascertained
by
the
greater
closeness
of
the
concentric
rings
and
consequent
hardness
of
the
fiber
the
sap
being
more
drawn
to
the
south
side
by
the
action
of
the
sun
causes
the
rings
on
that
side
to
swell
more
and
this
operation
of
nature
has
been
observed
by
nature
children
and
employed
by
them
as
a
sure
guide
in
their
long
wanderings
through
the
pathless
forests
where
they
find
a
home
the
journey
to
new
plymouth
was
rather
a
long
one
but
the
sagamore
and
his
companions
were
each
provided
with
a
small
quantity
of
their
usual
travelling
food
or
meal
made
of
parched
maize
which
they
carried
in
true
indian
fashion
in
their
hollow
leathern
girdles
when
they
came
to
a
pond
or
brook
they
paused
to
eat
a
few
handsful
of
this
simple
provision
which
is
so
dry
that
it
can
only
be
swallowed
when
either
water
or
snow
is
at
hand
ready
to
wash
down
each
mouthful
and
consequently
in
summer
the
natives
have
sometimes
to
travel
long
distances
before
they
can
avail
themselves
of
the
food
that
is
already
in
their
hands
immediately
on
his
arrival
at
new
plymouth
the
sagamore
repaired
to
the
dwelling
of
bradford
and
requesting
a
private
interview
at
which
no
one
was
allowed
to
be
present
except
the
wampanoge
interpreter
hobomak
he
informed
him
of
the
conspiracy
of
the
natives
and
warned
him
to
be
well
prepared
for
the
intended
attack
could
he
have
given
this
warning
and
ensured
the
safety
of
his
allies
without
betraying
the
whole
of
the
conspirators
projects
he
would
gladly
have
done
so
for
he
both
despised
and
hated
the
men
of
wessagussett
and
he
was
willing
that
they
should
he
treated
as
they
seemed
disposed
to
treat
such
of
his
race
as
they
could
get
into
their
power
he
even
made
an
attempt
to
persuade
bradford
to
leave
them
to
the
fate
they
so
well
deserved
and
to
connive
at
their
destruction
which
would
remove
an
increasing
evil
from
the
first
colony
but
the
president
soon
convinced
him
that
such
a
course
would
be
altogether
at
variance
with
the
precepts
and
principles
of
that
religion
in
which
he
gloried
and
which
it
was
his
chief
aim
and
that
of
all
his
christian
brethren
to
exalt
and
make
honorable
in
the
eyes
of
the
natives
and
that
therefore
no
selfish
considerations
could
induce
them
to
abandon
their
countrymen
to
destruction
notwithstanding
their
ingratitude
towards
themselves
and
their
ill
conduct
towards
the
indians
with
this
decision
masasoyt
was
extremely
dissatisfied
but
he
could
not
now
withdraw
the
information
he
had
imparted
even
if
he
desired
it
and
he
also
felt
it
to
be
most
politic
to
secure
the
friendship
of
the
white
men
even
if
it
should
involve
the
sacrifice
of
the
lives
of
some
of
his
own
countrymen
and
interfere
with
their
projects
of
vengeance
on
their
foes
this
was
most
likely
to
be
the
case
in
the
present
instance
for
the
governor
was
excited
to
great
indignation
by
the
intelligence
f
this
second
conspiracy
in
which
several
of
the
chiefs
who
had
signed
the
treaty
with
captain
standish
were
concerned
and
he
immediately
summoned
the
gallant
soldier
and
the
rest
of
his
council
to
deliberate
on
the
best
means
of
defeating
it
it
now
only
wanted
three
days
of
the
time
appointed
for
the
gathering
of
the
red
warriors
and
the
attack
on
wessagussett
no
time
was
therefore
to
be
lost
and
it
was
soon
determined
that
standish
with
a
band
of
eight
men
should
march
the
following
morning
at
and
come
stealthily
upon
the
savages
before
they
could
he
fully
prepared
for
the
assault
it
was
a
bold
perhaps
a
rash
measure
for
so
small
a
party
to
go
forth
and
encounter
the
native
forces
thus
combined
but
standish
though
a
man
of
prudence
and
discretion
was
a
stranger
to
fear
and
he
and
his
followers
had
already
learnt
the
power
of
order
and
discipline
in
compensating
for
any
disadvantage
of
numbers
it
was
therefore
with
cheerful
confidence
that
the
military
force
of
the
settlement
prepared
for
their
march
and
they
plainly
showed
on
what
that
confidence
was
founded
by
requesting
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
for
their
success
a
great
part
of
the
night
was
accordingly
spent
in
prayer
and
the
blessing
of
the
god
of
truth
and
mercy
was
solemnly
asked
upon
an
enterprise
that
the
leaders
well
knew
was
about
to
be
carried
out
by
fraud
and
cruelty
at
sunrise
the
soldiers
met
on
burying
hill
and
the
staff
of
office
was
given
with
much
solemnity
to
captain
standish
by
the
pious
and
venerable
brewster
they
had
already
taken
leave
of
their
wives
and
families
who
did
not
altogether
share
the
cheerful
exultation
displayed
by
the
puritan
warriors
and
who
were
not
permitted
to
be
present
at
this
final
ceremony
lest
their
anxious
fears
should
disturb
the
composure
of
their
husbands
and
fathers
notwithstanding
this
characteristic
prohibition
helen
and
her
younger
daughter
edith
had
ventured
to
station
themselves
in
the
path
that
led
down
burying
hill
in
the
direction
in
which
standish
and
his
men
were
to
march
that
they
might
take
one
more
farewell
of
rodolph
before
he
left
them
on
an
expedition
which
to
their
minds
seemed
fraught
with
danger
and
uncertainty
and
where
they
feared
he
might
again
be
exposed
to
the
vengeance
of
his
untiring
foe
the
gallant
little
band
marched
down
the
hill
and
came
where
edith
and
her
child
stood
waiting
beneath
a
tree
for
what
might
be
their
last
look
on
one
most
dearly
loved
and
when
rodolph
saw
them
he
forgot
the
strictness
of
discipline
and
order
required
by
his
commander
and
left
the
ranks
to
indulge
the
feelings
of
his
heart
by
again
embracing
his
weeping
wife
and
child
the
stern
captain
instantly
recalled
him
and
when
he
saw
a
tear
glistening
in
the
eye
of
the
husband
and
father
a
slight
expression
of
wonder
and
contempt
passed
over
his
countenance
he
marveled
that
so
brave
a
soldier
and
so
strict
a
puritan
as
rodolph
maitland
should
still
remain
subject
to
so
much
worldly
weakness
but
standish
was
not
at
that
time
a
married
man
and
he
was
very
deeply
imbued
with
all
the
severe
and
unbending
principles
of
his
sect
which
even
went
so
far
as
to
demand
the
suppression
of
all
natural
feelings
making
it
a
fault
for
a
mother
to
kiss
her
children
on
the
lord
day
and
inflicting
actual
punishment
on
the
captain
of
a
ship
for
having
embraced
his
wife
on
sunday
when
after
a
long
separation
she
hurried
to
meet
him
as
he
landed
from
the
vessel
to
such
puerile
littlenesses
will
even
great
minds
descend
rodolph
was
unmoved
by
the
commander
contemptuous
glance
he
knew
his
own
unflinching
puritan
principles
and
his
own
undaunted
courage
and
he
knew
his
value
in
the
eyes
of
standish
the
captain
knew
it
also
for
he
never
liked
to
go
on
any
enterprise
that
required
bravery
and
cool
judgement
without
securing
the
aid
of
maitland
and
although
the
tenderness
of
his
friend
feelings
and
the
warmth
of
his
domestic
attachments
so
different
to
the
coolness
and
apathy
which
was
so
prevalent
in
the
community
were
a
continual
subject
of
surprise
and
pity
to
the
leader
yet
he
highly
respected
him
and
even
loved
him
as
much
as
such
a
gentle
feeling
as
love
of
any
kind
could
find
admittance
to
his
breast
they
journeyed
on
stern
captain
who
had
no
tie
to
life
and
deemed
it
a
privilege
to
die
with
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
in
his
hand
fighting
for
the
cause
of
his
own
peculiar
sect
in
which
alone
he
thought
salvation
could
be
found
and
that
husband
and
father
who
felt
that
he
had
left
behind
him
what
was
far
dearer
than
life
itself
those
who
alone
made
life
precious
to
who
yet
was
willing
to
sacrifice
all
if
honor
and
duty
demanded
it
which
was
the
braver
man
of
the
two
both
were
brave
but
standish
was
the
most
unscrupulous
he
considered
that
any
stratagem
was
lawful
which
could
place
his
heathen
enemies
in
his
power
and
no
arguments
of
the
and
truthful
maitland
could
convince
him
that
deceit
and
treachery
even
towards
their
infidel
foes
were
unworthy
of
christian
warriors
miles
standish
was
resolved
to
use
some
device
to
get
the
chiefs
of
the
conspiracy
off
their
guard
and
by
destroying
them
to
break
up
the
hostile
confederacy
altogether
and
as
maitland
was
bound
to
obey
his
orders
and
also
knew
the
utter
impossibility
either
of
changing
the
resolves
of
his
captain
or
of
deserting
the
enterprise
he
was
compelled
to
join
in
proceedings
that
he
could
not
approve
when
the
little
band
had
arrived
at
the
spot
indicated
by
masasoyt
and
within
a
short
distance
of
the
indian
place
of
rendezvous
standish
commanded
his
men
to
halt
for
rest
and
refreshment
for
the
last
time
before
the
expected
encounter
with
the
army
of
savages
who
were
assembling
for
their
destruction
this
was
situated
on
the
summit
of
a
considerable
elevation
well
covered
with
trees
and
bushes
and
overlooking
a
plain
on
the
further
side
of
which
the
indian
camp
was
formed
the
advantageous
position
in
which
the
emigrants
were
posted
enabled
them
to
obtain
a
full
view
of
their
enemies
without
being
perceived
by
them
and
captain
standish
resolved
to
remain
there
quietly
that
night
in
order
to
recruit
the
strength
of
his
men
after
their
rapid
and
toilsome
journey
and
to
mature
his
plans
for
subduing
the
horde
of
natives
before
him
with
so
small
a
band
as
now
surrounded
him
and
who
waited
but
his
orders
to
rush
on
to
the
most
desperate
enterprise
the
wampanoge
interpreter
hobomak
accompanied
the
party
at
his
own
desire
and
that
also
of
his
sovereign
masasoyt
standish
was
glad
of
his
assistance
in
his
capacity
of
interpreter
he
had
already
shown
such
devoted
attachment
to
the
english
that
they
entertained
no
fears
of
his
either
betraying
or
deserting
their
cause
and
on
this
occasion
he
fully
justified
their
confidence
early
in
the
morning
the
leader
announced
his
intention
of
going
himself
to
the
indian
camp
to
make
overtures
of
peace
and
to
invite
the
chiefs
to
a
conference
and
he
desired
his
men
to
construct
a
strong
and
spacious
wigwam
for
their
reception
and
to
make
a
door
to
it
which
could
be
closed
and
fastened
securely
he
did
not
then
explain
his
project
more
clearly
but
rudolph
understood
it
and
his
soul
revolted
from
the
treachery
he
suspected
said
the
captain
having
finished
his
directions
to
his
followers
will
volunteer
to
go
down
with
me
and
hobomak
to
the
heathen
camp
and
to
carry
the
flag
of
truce
before
me
it
may
be
a
service
of
danger
to
enter
that
hornet
nest
and
no
one
who
has
left
his
soldier
heart
at
home
with
his
wife
or
his
children
had
better
attempt
it
rudolph
felt
the
sarcasm
though
it
was
uttered
good
humoredly
and
he
instantly
replied
am
ready
my
chief
to
attend
you
wherever
you
may
go
and
if
i
have
left
my
heart
affections
at
new
plymouth
you
shall
see
that
i
have
brought
with
me
none
the
less
of
courage
and
fidelity
to
my
leaders
and
my
countrymen
the
dearer
my
home
the
more
energetic
shall
be
my
efforts
to
preserve
it
from
desolation
besides
he
added
in
an
undertone
so
that
only
standish
should
hear
much
prefer
going
boldly
into
the
midst
of
the
enemy
even
at
the
risk
of
my
life
to
remaining
here
to
assist
in
constructing
a
trap
for
their
destruction
are
a
brave
fellow
maitland
said
the
captain
grasping
his
hand
with
warmth
and
energy
you
have
brought
some
peculiar
prejudices
over
from
europe
with
you
and
do
not
yet
perceive
the
difference
of
warring
on
equal
terms
with
civilized
troops
as
you
were
accustomed
to
do
in
your
youth
and
contending
with
a
horde
of
savages
who
know
nothing
of
the
laws
of
honor
and
who
are
even
now
combined
to
destroy
us
all
without
either
challenge
or
preparation
come
along
with
me
and
leave
the
rest
to
do
as
i
have
directed
necessity
has
no
law
and
if
we
do
not
meet
those
cunning
natives
with
equal
cunning
we
shall
have
no
chance
against
them
and
sincerity
appear
to
me
the
strongest
necessity
and
the
god
of
truth
will
order
the
results
as
he
pleases
answered
rodolph
i
have
sworn
to
obey
your
orders
and
you
need
not
fear
the
constancy
of
either
my
heart
or
hand
i
know
my
duty
as
a
soldier
and
i
will
do
it
know
you
will
maitland
replied
his
commander
and
his
respect
for
his
conscientious
friend
rose
higher
than
ever
while
a
slight
misgiving
as
to
the
righteousness
of
his
own
projected
plan
passed
through
his
breast
it
did
not
abide
there
however
for
he
was
really
satisfied
that
he
was
acting
in
conformity
to
the
will
of
god
and
that
he
was
fully
justified
in
asking
for
his
blessing
to
crown
his
murderous
schemes
with
success
maitland
took
the
flag
of
truce
which
consisted
of
a
long
spear
with
a
white
handkerchief
attached
to
the
summit
and
preceded
the
captain
who
followed
in
full
uniform
attended
by
his
swarthy
interpreter
as
soon
as
they
emerged
from
the
wood
that
covered
the
and
entered
the
open
plain
they
were
espied
by
the
keen
and
watchful
eyes
of
the
natives
and
a
messenger
was
dispatched
to
meet
them
and
bring
them
to
the
presence
of
the
indian
leader
wattawamat
who
was
regarded
as
the
chief
of
the
conspirators
captain
standish
assumed
a
pacific
air
and
desired
hobomak
to
advance
before
him
and
inform
the
chiefs
that
he
came
to
propose
terms
of
reconciliation
and
peace
he
then
himself
approached
them
and
with
the
aid
of
the
interpreter
made
to
them
a
rather
lengthy
harangue
on
the
benefits
that
would
accrue
to
them
from
preserving
peace
with
the
white
men
and
his
sorrow
and
that
of
his
employers
on
having
accidentally
discovered
that
the
tribes
of
massachusetts
entertained
feelings
of
enmity
towards
the
british
settlers
at
wessagussett
ever
and
anon
during
the
translations
of
the
various
paragraphs
of
this
speech
rodolph
observed
the
keen
eyes
of
the
captain
as
they
carefully
surveyed
the
surrounding
force
and
examined
the
individuals
who
appeared
to
be
their
leaders
and
once
when
his
own
eye
followed
the
direction
of
his
commander
his
glance
encountered
one
that
instantly
riveted
it
and
excited
in
his
breast
some
sensations
not
of
for
rodolph
knew
not
the
feeling
but
of
inquietude
and
distrust
yes
coubitant
was
there
gazing
at
his
supposed
victim
with
amazement
and
hatred
and
half
inclined
to
believe
that
some
supernatural
power
must
belong
to
the
man
who
could
have
been
wounded
with
his
deadly
arrow
and
yet
survive
to
confront
him
once
more
there
he
stood
with
disappointed
vengeance
in
his
heart
and
fury
flashing
from
that
eye
of
fire
but
while
he
kept
a
continual
watch
on
every
movement
of
rodolph
his
quick
ear
lost
not
one
word
of
the
speech
that
hobomak
was
rendering
into
his
native
tongue
he
heard
when
in
standish
name
he
invited
the
chiefs
to
meet
him
in
the
wigwam
that
his
men
were
constructing
on
the
border
of
the
thicket
and
where
he
said
he
would
smoke
with
them
the
pipe
of
peace
and
give
to
them
the
presents
that
the
governor
had
sent
as
pledges
of
his
friendly
intentions
the
moment
this
invitation
had
been
delivered
coubitant
approached
wattawamat
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
to
which
the
chieftain
gave
a
sign
of
acquiescence
and
then
the
nansett
left
the
assembly
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
and
bushes
that
bounded
the
plain
on
every
side
wattawamat
gave
no
immediate
reply
to
the
proposal
of
the
english
chief
but
as
is
not
unusual
with
the
indians
kept
up
a
long
discourse
and
contrived
to
lengthen
the
audience
for
a
considerable
time
another
indian
then
approached
the
sachem
and
again
whispered
to
him
some
words
that
gave
him
evident
satisfaction
for
he
smiled
grimly
and
displayed
his
fine
row
of
ivory
teeth
for
a
moment
as
he
nodded
approbation
to
the
messenger
then
resuming
his
wonted
gravity
of
demeanor
he
replied
to
captain
standish
that
he
was
satisfied
by
his
assurances
of
the
good
faith
of
the
white
men
and
that
he
and
his
brother
chiefs
would
avail
themselves
of
his
invitation
and
meet
in
the
wigwam
a
little
before
sunset
where
he
hoped
so
to
arrange
all
the
little
disagreements
that
had
occurred
between
the
red
men
and
the
mighty
strangers
as
to
be
able
to
establish
between
them
and
all
his
countrymen
the
same
friendship
and
alliance
that
appeared
to
exist
with
the
wampanoge
tribe
whose
chief
he
observed
with
a
slight
curl
of
his
lip
had
failed
in
his
promise
to
attend
their
meeting
that
day
the
cause
of
this
favorable
decision
on
the
part
of
wattawamat
was
the
report
that
coubitant
had
just
sent
him
of
the
insignificant
force
of
the
english
which
that
crafty
and
warrior
had
contrived
to
ascertain
by
running
round
the
border
of
the
weed
to
the
place
where
standish
men
were
at
work
and
taking
an
accurate
and
unobserved
survey
of
their
numbers
he
felt
convinced
that
it
would
be
easy
for
the
chiefs
and
such
of
their
attendants
as
might
be
allowed
to
follow
them
to
the
place
of
conference
to
overpower
and
destroy
every
one
of
the
little
band
of
whites
and
then
to
prosecute
their
original
intention
of
carrying
fire
and
slaughter
into
both
the
british
settlements
in
all
this
scheme
there
was
nothing
so
grateful
to
the
ruthless
heart
of
coubitant
as
the
idea
of
rodolph
death
and
that
too
as
he
trusted
by
his
own
hand
o
how
he
panted
for
the
devilish
joy
of
tearing
off
his
scalp
and
carrying
it
back
to
throw
it
triumphantly
at
henrich
feet
we
shall
see
whether
such
joy
was
accorded
to
him
standish
and
his
companions
took
their
leave
and
returned
to
the
hill
where
they
found
great
progress
had
been
made
in
building
the
wigwam
and
two
hours
before
sunset
it
was
completely
wattled
round
leaving
only
a
small
aperture
near
the
top
to
admit
light
and
a
narrow
place
of
entrance
to
which
a
strong
door
was
affixed
the
captain
then
explained
his
plan
which
was
approved
by
all
but
maitland
and
he
forbore
to
urge
any
further
opposition
which
he
felt
would
now
be
useless
a
temperate
meal
was
partaken
of
and
a
hymn
sung
by
the
undaunted
little
company
and
pipes
and
tobacco
having
been
plentifully
placed
in
the
hut
the
sides
of
which
were
decorated
with
pieces
of
gay
colored
calico
and
a
few
knives
and
trinkets
as
pretended
gifts
to
the
chiefs
nothing
remained
but
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
victims
soon
the
indian
chiefs
decked
in
all
their
bravery
of
feathers
and
embroidered
skins
came
marching
a
cross
the
plain
followed
by
a
few
attendants
less
richly
adorned
standish
and
his
party
went
to
meet
them
and
conducted
them
with
much
courtesy
to
the
wigwam
which
was
soon
obscured
by
the
clouds
of
smoke
that
issued
from
the
pipes
of
the
grave
and
silent
assembly
but
this
silent
gravity
did
not
long
continue
captain
standish
addressed
the
chiefs
and
strove
to
speak
kindly
to
men
whose
deaths
he
was
compassing
all
the
while
but
whether
his
resolution
somewhat
failed
as
the
moment
for
the
execution
of
his
bloody
purpose
drew
on
or
whether
he
was
disconcerted
by
the
absence
of
rodolph
who
refused
to
enter
the
wigwam
and
assist
at
the
slaughter
so
it
was
that
he
manifested
evident
signs
of
weakness
and
indecision
the
chiefs
were
emboldened
by
this
and
they
were
troubled
by
no
qualms
of
conscience
on
the
subject
of
shedding
the
white
men
blood
they
rose
from
their
seats
on
the
ground
and
began
to
taunt
the
captain
with
his
want
of
eloquence
and
also
with
the
smallness
of
his
stature
which
was
despicable
in
their
eyes
then
growing
still
bolder
as
they
became
excited
they
drew
their
knives
and
whetted
them
before
the
eyes
of
their
hosts
flourishing
them
round
their
heads
and
boasting
how
they
had
already
shed
the
blood
of
many
white
men
in
the
distant
european
settlements
it
was
a
fearful
scene
but
the
real
peril
of
his
situation
instantly
restored
the
commander
to
his
wonted
resolution
and
firmness
he
called
on
his
men
to
be
ready
and
not
to
allow
one
of
the
chiefs
to
escape
from
the
wigwam
and
with
his
hand
on
his
pistols
he
waited
the
proper
moment
for
action
the
indians
continued
to
pour
forth
the
most
abusive
epithets
but
they
did
not
begin
the
expected
attack
and
it
was
evident
that
they
were
a
little
intimidated
by
the
undaunted
bearing
of
the
white
men
one
of
them
however
seemed
actuated
by
some
desperate
purpose
and
to
be
regardless
of
aught
else
from
the
moment
of
his
entrance
into
the
wigwam
his
eyes
had
sought
some
object
that
they
did
not
find
and
now
in
all
the
excitement
of
the
approaching
conflict
his
only
aim
seemed
to
be
to
make
his
way
through
the
entrance
in
search
of
some
person
on
whom
he
desired
to
wreak
his
fury
it
was
rodolph
whom
coubitant
sought
and
who
was
now
providentially
out
of
his
reach
and
waiting
the
result
of
the
deed
against
which
he
had
vainly
protested
at
length
the
wrath
of
standish
broke
loose
he
gave
the
appointed
signal
and
the
door
was
closed
shutting
in
friends
and
foes
in
one
small
field
of
battle
or
rather
of
carnage
the
scene
in
the
lighted
wigwam
was
terrific
and
the
yells
of
the
infuriated
natives
broke
with
a
sickening
effect
on
the
ears
of
rodolph
maitland
who
could
not
consent
to
share
in
what
he
considered
a
murderous
conflict
and
not
an
honorable
war
and
who
yet
felt
as
if
he
was
deserting
his
countrymen
by
thus
remaining
inactive
but
if
he
felt
undecided
as
to
his
proper
course
of
action
that
indecision
did
not
last
long
in
a
few
moments
the
door
of
the
wigwam
was
violently
burst
open
and
the
combatants
rushed
out
struggling
and
bleeding
from
the
den
of
slaughter
all
the
white
men
came
forth
for
though
many
of
them
were
wounded
not
one
had
fallen
but
three
of
the
indians
lay
dead
and
dying
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
one
of
them
being
the
mangled
body
of
wattawamat
who
was
slain
by
standish
with
his
own
knife
that
very
knife
which
the
savage
had
sharpened
for
the
purpose
of
plunging
it
into
the
heart
of
the
white
chief
where
was
rodolph
now
in
the
midst
of
the
fray
fighting
desperately
and
successfully
the
moment
he
saw
the
battle
raging
in
open
field
and
beheld
the
blood
flowing
from
the
wounds
of
his
countrymen
he
forgot
all
else
except
that
his
strong
right
arm
wielded
a
trusty
blade
and
its
skilful
stroke
soon
brought
another
of
the
red
warriors
to
the
ground
and
chased
away
those
who
sought
to
secure
their
wounded
comrade
the
indians
saw
that
they
were
overmatched
and
that
nothing
but
flight
could
save
the
remainder
of
their
party
they
therefore
uttered
their
wild
once
more
and
commenced
a
rapid
retreat
down
the
hill
pausing
several
times
to
send
back
a
volley
of
arrows
on
their
victorious
foes
which
however
fell
harmless
to
the
earth
though
more
than
one
was
aimed
at
rodolph
by
the
strong
and
skilful
hand
of
coubitant
but
rest
was
not
to
be
afforded
to
the
little
conquering
band
while
they
were
securing
the
wounded
indian
and
binding
up
their
own
wounds
they
discovered
a
movement
in
the
body
of
savages
on
the
other
side
of
the
plain
and
truly
surmised
that
they
were
preparing
to
attack
them
in
greater
numbers
standish
instantly
gave
orders
that
the
indian
whom
rodolph
had
brought
to
the
ground
should
be
hung
to
a
neighboring
tree
which
was
as
instantly
executed
and
he
the
tent
to
make
sure
that
no
life
remained
in
those
three
who
lay
on
its
bloody
floor
all
were
dead
and
standish
approaching
the
body
of
the
chieftain
wattawamat
raised
his
good
broad
sword
and
at
one
blow
severed
the
head
from
the
trunk
then
seizing
the
gory
head
by
the
long
he
carried
it
forth
as
a
trophy
and
desired
one
of
his
men
to
secure
it
and
carry
it
back
to
new
plymouth
no
time
remained
for
further
parley
a
band
of
indians
were
approaching
across
the
plain
and
standish
disdained
to
fly
even
before
such
superior
numbers
every
musket
and
pistol
was
hastily
loaded
and
the
undaunted
party
marched
down
the
hill
to
meet
the
coming
foe
they
met
and
in
spite
of
the
furious
onset
of
the
savages
they
were
again
made
to
feel
that
their
undisciplined
hordes
were
no
match
for
the
aimed
of
the
white
men
and
had
no
power
to
break
the
order
of
their
steady
ranks
once
more
they
fled
leaving
another
of
their
number
dead
on
the
field
and
they
returned
no
more
to
the
charge
during
all
this
affair
hobomak
had
remained
a
quiet
spectator
of
the
combat
and
of
the
defeat
of
his
countrymen
and
now
he
approached
the
english
captain
and
complacently
praised
his
bravery
and
military
prowess
and
he
remained
as
devoted
as
ever
to
his
christian
friends
the
triumphant
soldiers
returned
to
new
plymouth
and
were
received
with
joyful
exultation
by
the
governor
and
the
inhabitants
who
felt
deeply
grateful
for
the
deliverance
that
had
been
accorded
to
them
and
the
safety
of
the
brave
men
who
had
fought
in
their
defense
all
the
little
band
had
been
preserved
from
serious
personal
injury
but
rodolph
maitland
had
also
been
preserved
from
and
that
was
more
to
him
than
life
and
safety
and
to
his
christian
and
devoted
wife
also
the
head
of
wattawamat
was
brought
to
new
plymouth
and
the
dreadful
trophy
was
conspicuously
placed
over
the
entrance
to
the
fortress
as
a
warning
to
the
natives
against
any
future
conspiracies
for
the
destruction
of
the
white
men
so
great
indeed
was
the
terror
inspired
by
the
power
and
the
severity
of
the
settlers
that
many
of
the
natives
who
were
conscious
of
having
been
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
though
undiscovered
left
their
wigwams
and
fled
into
the
woods
or
concealed
themselves
in
reedy
morasses
where
a
great
number
of
them
perished
from
hunger
and
disease
the
settlers
were
much
distressed
at
this
result
of
their
proceedings
which
at
the
same
time
they
considered
to
have
been
perfectly
justified
by
the
necessity
of
preservation
but
when
their
venerated
pastor
robinson
to
whom
they
had
ever
since
their
emigration
looked
for
guidance
and
sympathy
heard
of
these
sad
events
he
expressed
the
deepest
sorrow
and
begged
them
never
again
to
be
led
away
by
the
fiery
temper
of
their
leader
adding
these
touching
and
impressive
words
how
happy
a
thing
had
it
been
if
you
had
before
you
had
killed
any
chapter
xv
change
came
the
spirit
of
my
dream
the
boy
was
sprung
to
manhood
to
the
wilds
of
distant
climes
he
made
himself
a
home
and
his
soul
drank
their
beauties
he
was
girt
with
strange
and
dusky
aspects
he
was
not
himself
like
what
he
had
been
on
the
sea
and
on
the
shore
he
was
a
wanderer
byron
on
the
border
of
a
green
meadow
watered
by
a
narrow
stream
the
wigwams
of
a
large
indian
settlement
were
lighted
up
by
the
slanting
beams
of
the
setting
sun
as
they
shone
soft
and
bright
through
the
tall
dark
pines
and
birch
trees
beneath
which
the
village
was
erected
the
deep
red
trunks
of
the
ancient
fir
trees
contrasted
beautifully
with
the
silvery
bark
of
the
birch
and
between
the
shadows
which
were
cast
by
the
gigantic
boles
of
these
and
many
other
varieties
of
timber
the
sunbeams
played
on
the
smooth
soft
turf
and
illuminated
a
scene
of
peaceful
joy
and
contentment
towards
the
center
of
the
broken
and
irregular
in
which
the
huts
were
arranged
rose
two
wigwams
of
a
size
and
construction
superior
to
the
rest
and
around
them
were
planted
many
flowering
shrubs
and
plants
that
clearly
showed
the
habitations
to
have
been
permanently
fixed
for
some
seasons
and
to
have
been
occupied
by
persons
who
possessed
more
of
good
taste
and
forethought
than
are
commonly
displayed
by
the
improvident
natives
many
climbing
plants
also
threw
their
luxuriant
branches
over
the
sides
and
roof
of
these
rude
but
picturesque
dwellings
and
the
brilliant
blossoms
hung
gracefully
around
the
eaves
and
the
doorway
and
moved
gently
in
the
evening
breeze
on
a
bench
in
front
of
one
of
these
wigwams
sat
an
aged
indian
chief
and
by
his
side
a
young
woman
who
seemed
to
possess
all
the
ease
of
manner
and
refinement
of
a
european
but
whose
clear
brown
skin
and
glossy
hair
and
eyes
at
once
showed
her
to
be
of
the
same
race
as
her
venerable
companion
her
dress
was
also
indian
but
arranged
with
a
taste
and
delicacy
that
rendered
it
eminently
becoming
to
her
graceful
figure
while
her
hair
instead
of
being
either
drawn
up
to
knot
on
the
crown
of
the
head
or
left
loose
and
disheveled
in
native
fashion
was
braided
into
a
truly
classical
form
and
simply
adorned
with
a
beautiful
white
a
flower
that
oriana
always
loved
two
other
figures
completed
the
group
that
was
formed
near
the
wigwam
door
one
of
them
was
a
young
man
of
tall
end
muscular
form
whose
dress
and
weapons
would
have
proclaimed
him
to
be
an
indian
warrior
and
chieftain
had
not
his
curling
brown
hair
and
deep
blue
eyes
spoken
of
a
saxon
lineage
courage
and
intelligence
gleamed
in
those
fearless
eyes
but
no
indian
fierceness
or
cunning
were
there
and
as
the
tall
warrior
stooped
towards
the
ground
and
lifted
up
in
his
arms
a
laughing
little
child
that
was
reclining
on
the
mossy
turf
and
tearing
to
pieces
a
handful
of
flowers
that
his
father
had
gathered
for
him
the
smile
of
affection
and
happiness
that
lighted
up
those
clear
blue
eyes
showed
that
a
warm
and
manly
heart
was
there
ludovico
said
the
happy
young
father
as
he
fondly
kissed
the
child
whose
azure
eyes
and
long
black
eyelashes
and
curling
raven
hair
showed
his
descent
both
from
the
fair
race
of
britain
and
america
wild
wandering
children
ludovico
how
well
i
remember
your
uncle
when
he
was
a
merry
infant
like
you
and
used
to
roll
on
the
grass
in
my
sweet
sister
edith
garden
and
tear
its
gaudy
blossoms
as
you
do
these
flowers
of
the
forest
those
were
happy
days
he
added
and
the
bright
smile
of
careless
mirth
changed
to
one
of
pensive
sadness
those
were
happy
days
that
never
can
return
if
my
sisters
and
my
playful
little
brother
yet
live
they
must
be
changed
indeed
from
what
they
were
when
last
i
saw
their
sweet
faces
on
that
eventful
evening
that
fixed
the
course
of
my
destiny
edith
must
now
be
a
woman
a
lovely
woman
too
and
little
ludovico
a
fine
hearted
boy
and
my
beloved
parents
too
o
that
i
knew
they
were
alive
and
well
and
that
ere
long
they
would
see
and
bless
my
oriana
and
my
child
and
henrich
seated
himself
by
the
side
of
his
young
indian
wife
and
gazed
in
the
face
of
his
laughing
boy
with
an
expression
at
once
so
sad
and
sweet
that
the
child
became
silent
and
thoughtful
too
and
dropping
the
flowers
that
filled
his
little
hands
he
gently
clasped
them
as
if
in
prayer
and
looked
long
and
searchingly
into
his
eyes
now
you
look
exactly
as
my
brother
used
to
do
when
he
knelt
at
my
mother
knee
and
she
taught
him
to
lisp
his
evening
prayer
exclaimed
henrich
and
his
eyes
glistened
with
emotion
as
home
and
all
its
loved
associations
rushed
into
his
mind
oriana
saw
his
sadness
and
felt
as
she
often
had
done
before
on
similar
occasions
a
pang
of
painful
regret
and
even
of
jealousy
towards
those
relatives
whom
her
husband
still
so
deeply
regretted
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
and
raising
her
large
expressive
eyes
to
his
now
melancholy
countenance
she
gently
said
henrich
still
grieve
that
the
red
men
stole
him
away
from
the
home
of
his
childhood
and
brought
him
to
dwell
among
the
forests
is
not
oriana
better
to
him
than
a
sister
and
are
not
the
smiles
of
his
own
ludovico
sweeter
to
his
heart
than
even
those
of
his
little
brother
used
to
be
and
is
not
my
father
his
father
also
o
henrich
my
own
henrich
she
added
while
she
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
tears
burst
from
her
eyes
and
chased
each
other
down
her
clear
olive
checks
to
which
deep
emotion
now
gave
a
richer
glow
me
do
you
wish
to
be
set
free
from
all
the
ties
that
bind
you
to
our
race
and
return
to
your
own
people
to
dwell
again
with
them
and
perhaps
to
lift
the
tomahawk
and
east
the
spear
against
those
who
have
loved
you
and
cherished
you
so
fondly
often
have
you
told
me
that
your
indian
wife
and
child
are
dearer
to
you
than
all
that
you
have
left
behind
you
at
new
plymouth
but
tell
it
to
me
again
let
me
hear
you
say
again
that
you
are
happy
here
and
will
never
desert
us
for
when
i
see
that
sorrowful
look
in
your
dear
eyes
and
remember
all
you
have
lost
and
still
are
losing
to
live
in
a
wilderness
with
wild
and
savage
men
my
heart
misgives
me
and
i
feel
that
you
were
never
made
for
such
a
life
and
that
your
love
is
far
too
precious
to
be
given
for
ever
to
an
indian
girl
the
smile
returned
to
henrich
eyes
as
he
listened
to
this
fond
appeal
and
he
almost
reproached
himself
for
ever
suffering
regret
for
the
blessings
he
had
lost
to
arise
in
his
mind
when
those
he
still
possessed
were
so
many
and
so
great
oriana
you
need
not
fear
he
replied
affectionately
speak
the
truth
of
my
heart
when
i
tell
you
that
i
would
not
exchange
my
indian
home
and
sacrifice
my
indian
squaw
and
my
little
son
for
all
the
comforts
and
pleasures
of
civilized
life
no
not
even
to
be
restored
to
the
parents
i
still
love
so
dearly
and
the
brother
and
sister
who
played
with
me
in
childhood
but
still
i
yearn
to
look
upon
their
faces
again
and
to
hear
once
more
their
words
of
love
i
well
know
how
they
have
all
mourned
for
me
and
i
know
how
even
after
so
many
years
have
passed
they
would
rejoice
at
finding
me
again
they
must
indeed
have
mourned
for
you
henrich
that
must
have
been
a
sad
night
to
them
when
coubitant
bore
you
away
but
i
owe
all
the
happiness
of
my
life
to
that
cruel
deed
and
can
i
regret
it
if
my
white
brother
had
not
come
to
our
camp
i
should
have
lived
and
died
an
ignorant
indian
squaw
i
should
have
known
no
thing
of
true
religion
or
of
the
christian
god
and
continued
oriana
smiling
at
her
husband
with
a
sweetness
and
archness
of
expression
that
made
her
countenance
really
beautiful
should
never
have
known
my
henrich
said
old
tisquantum
rousing
himself
from
the
reverie
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
enjoying
the
warm
sunbeams
as
they
fell
on
his
now
feeble
limbs
and
long
white
hair
are
you
talking
again
of
henrich
leaving
us
it
is
wrong
of
you
to
doubt
him
my
son
has
given
me
his
word
that
he
will
never
take
you
from
me
until
mahneto
recalls
my
spirit
to
himself
and
i
dwell
again
with
my
fathers
has
he
not
also
said
that
he
will
never
leave
or
forsake
you
and
his
boy
why
then
do
you
make
your
heart
sad
henrich
has
never
deceived
us
he
has
never
in
all
the
years
that
he
has
lived
in
our
wigwam
and
shared
our
wanderings
said
the
thing
that
was
not
and
shall
we
suspect
him
now
no
oriana
i
trust
him
as
i
would
have
trusted
my
own
tekoa
and
had
my
brave
boy
lived
he
could
not
have
been
dearer
to
me
than
henrich
is
he
could
not
have
surpassed
him
in
hunting
or
in
war
he
could
not
have
guided
and
governed
my
people
with
more
wisdom
now
that
i
am
too
old
and
feeble
to
be
their
leader
and
he
could
not
have
watched
over
my
declining
years
with
more
of
gentleness
and
love
henrich
will
never
desert
us
no
not
if
we
return
to
the
of
our
tribe
near
paomet
as
i
hope
to
do
ere
i
close
my
eyes
in
death
so
long
as
i
feared
my
white
son
would
leave
us
and
return
to
his
own
people
i
never
turned
my
feet
towards
paomet
for
he
had
wound
himself
into
my
heart
and
had
taken
place
there
and
i
saw
that
he
had
wound
himself
into
your
heart
too
my
child
and
i
knew
that
he
was
more
to
us
than
the
land
of
our
birth
therefore
i
have
kept
my
hunters
wandering
from
north
to
south
and
from
east
to
west
and
have
visited
the
mountains
and
the
prairies
and
the
mighty
rivers
and
the
great
lakes
and
have
found
a
home
in
all
but
now
our
henrich
is
one
of
us
and
never
will
forsake
us
for
any
others
is
he
not
sachem
of
my
warriors
and
do
they
not
look
to
him
as
their
leader
and
their
father
no
henrich
will
never
leave
us
now

which
the
main
body
of
the

and
the
old
man
who
had
become
excited
during
this
long
harangue
smiled
at
his
children
with
love
and
confidence
and
again
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes
relapsing
into
that
quiet
dreamy
state
in
which
the
indians
especially
the
more
aged
among
them
are
so
fond
of
indulging
tisquantum
was
now
a
very
old
man
and
the
great
changes
and
vicissitudes
of
climate
and
mode
of
life
and
the
severe
bodily
exertions
in
warfare
and
hunting
to
which
he
had
been
all
his
life
exposed
made
him
appear
more
advanced
in
years
than
he
actually
was
since
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
to
the
white
stranger
which
occurred
about
three
years
previous
to
the
time
at
which
our
narrative
has
now
arrived
he
had
indulged
himself
in
an
almost
total
cessation
from
business
and
from
every
active
employment
and
had
resigned
the
government
of
his
followers
into
the
able
and
energetic
hands
of
his
henrich
was
now
regarded
as
chieftain
of
that
branch
of
the
nausett
tribe
over
which
tisquantum
held
authority
and
so
much
had
he
made
himself
both
loved
and
respected
during
his
residence
among
the
red
men
that
all
jealousy
of
his
english
origin
and
foreign
complexion
had
gradually
died
away
and
his
guidance
in
war
or
in
council
was
always
promptly
and
implicitly
followed
and
henrich
was
happy
very
happy
in
his
wild
and
wandering
life
he
had
passed
from
boyhood
to
manhood
amid
the
scenery
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
wilderness
and
though
his
heart
and
his
memory
would
still
frequently
revert
to
the
home
of
his
parents
and
all
that
he
had
loved
and
prized
of
the
connections
and
the
habits
of
civilized
life
yet
he
now
hardly
wished
to
resume
those
habits
indeed
had
such
a
resumption
implied
the
abandoning
his
wife
and
child
and
his
venerable
law
no
consideration
would
ever
have
induced
him
to
think
of
it
he
had
likewise
as
tisquantum
said
on
obtaining
his
consent
to
his
marriage
with
oriana
solemnly
promised
never
to
take
her
away
from
him
while
he
lived
therefore
at
present
he
entertained
no
intention
of
again
rejoining
his
countrymen
and
renouncing
his
indian
mode
of
life
still
voices
of
his
home
were
often
ringing
in
his
ear
by
day
and
by
night
and
the
desire
to
know
the
fate
of
his
beloved
family
and
once
more
to
behold
each
member
of
it
would
sometimes
come
over
him
with
an
intensity
that
seemed
to
absorb
every
other
feeling
then
he
would
devise
plan
after
plan
by
which
he
might
hope
to
obtain
some
intelligence
of
the
settlement
or
convey
to
his
relatives
the
knowledge
of
his
safety
but
never
had
he
yet
succeeded
tisquantum
had
taken
watchful
care
for
several
years
to
prevent
any
such
communication
being
effected
and
it
was
as
we
have
seen
mainly
with
this
object
that
he
had
absented
himself
from
the
rest
of
his
tribe
and
his
own
former
place
of
abode
he
had
led
his
warriors
and
their
families
far
to
the
north
and
there
he
had
resided
for
several
years
only
returning
occasionally
to
the
prairies
for
the
hunting
season
and
again
travelling
northward
when
the
buffalo
and
the
elk
were
no
longer
abundant
in
the
plains
in
all
these
wanderings
henrich
had
rejoiced
and
his
whole
soul
had
been
elevated
by
such
constant
communion
with
the
grandest
works
of
nature
or
rather
of
nature
god
he
had
gazed
on
the
stupendous
cataract
of
niagara
and
listened
to
its
thunders
till
he
felt
himself
in
the
immediate
presence
of
deity
in
all
its
omnipotence

had
passed
in

boundless

of
the

alabaster
with
windows
of

as
clear

beautiful

dwellings
were
in

eyes

be

the
many

with

cold
walls
glittering
with
the

burnt
so
brightly

warmly

had
he
slept
on
the
bedsteads
of
snow
that
these
small
northern
men
find
so
comfortable
when
they
have
strewn
them
with
a
thick
layer
of

ardently
did
henrich
desire

who
used
to
share
his

feeling
and
sympathize
in
all
him
love
and
reverence
for
the
works
of

but
in
all
those
days
and
months
and
years
that
elapsed
between
the
time
when
we
left
henrich
in
the
of
the
west
and
the
time
to
which
we
have
now
carried
him
oriana
had
been
a
sister
yes
more
than
a
him
and
she
had
learnt
to
think
as
he
thought
and
to
feel
as
he
felt
till
he
used
to
tell
her
that
he
almost
fancied
the
spirit
of
edith
had
passed
into
her
form
and
had
come
to
share
his
exile
certainly
the
mind
and
feelings
of
the
indian
girl
did
ripen
and
expand
with
wonderful
rapidity
and
as
she
grew
to
womanhood
her
gentle
gracefulness
of
manner
and
her
devoted
affection
towards
henrich
confirmed
the
attachment
that
had
been
gradually
forming
in
his
heart
ever
since
he
had
been
her
adopted
brother
and
made
him
resolve
to
ask
her
of
the
sachem
as
his
wife
since
the
conduct
of
coubitant
had
excited
as
we
saw
in
a
former
chapter
the
suspicions
of
tisquantum
and
had
so
evidently
increased
the
dislike
of
oriana
the
chieftain
had
abandoned
all
idea
of
bestowing
his
daughter
hand
on
him
or
of
making
him
his
successor
in
his
official
situation
and
the
departure
of
the
cruel
and
wily
savage
had
been
to
him
as
well
as
to
oriana
and
henrich
a
great
satisfaction
and
relief
none
of
them
wished
to
see
his
dark
countenance
again
or
to
be
exposed
to
his
evil
machinations
and
all
were
fully
aware
that
the
marriage
of
the
white
stranger
to
the
sachem
lovely
daughter
was
a
circumstance
that
would
arouse
all
his
jealousy
and
all
his
vengeance
nevertheless
this
apprehension
did
not
deter
the
old
chief
from
giving
a
joyful
consent
to
the
proposal
of
henrich
to
become
his
son
in
fact
as
he
had
long
been
in
name
and
affection
and
the
summer
of
the
year
had
seen
the
nuptials
celebrated
in
indian
fashion
on
the
same
day
also
the
young
widow
mailah
became
the
wife
of
henrich
chosen
friend
and
companion
jyanough
who
had
never
left
the
nausetts
since
first
he
joined
them
but
had
followed
his
arms
in
all
his
various
wanderings
it
was
a
joyful
day
to
the
tribe
when
this
double
marriage
took
place
and
great
was
the
feasting
beneath
the
trees
on
the
shores
of
the
mighty
lake
ontario
where
their
camp
was
pitched
game
was
roasted
in
abundance
and
much
tobacco
was
consumed
in
honor
of
the
happy
couples
who
were
all
beloved
by
their
simple
followers
and
for
whom
fresh
wigwams
were
built
and
strewed
with
sweet
sprays
of
pine
and
fir
and
furnished
with
all
that
indian
wants
demanded
and
indian
art
could
furnish
with
some
difficulty
henrich
prevailed
on
the
sachem
to
permit
his
daughter
to
forego
the
native
custom
of
cutting
off
her
hair
on
the
day
of
her
marriage
and
wearing
an
uncouth
until
it
grew
again
but
at
length
he
was
successful
on
the
plea
that
oriana
being
a
christian
and
about
to
unite
herself
to
a
christian
also
could
not
be
bound
to
observe
the
superstitious
and
barbarous
ceremonies
of
her
race
her
fine
black
locks
were
therefore
spared
but
mailah
was
a
second
time
robbed
of
hers
and
appeared
for
many
months
afterwards
with
her
head
closely
shrouded
in
the
prescribed
covering
much
did
henrich
wish
that
he
and
his

the

of

of

as
a
sacred
sanction
of

but
this
could
not
be
and
he
endeavored
to
supply
the

and
to
give
a
holy
and
christian
character
to
what
he
felt
to
be
the
most
solemn
act
of
his
life
by
uniting
in
earnest
prayer
with

the

and

three
years
had

no

had
occurred
to

to

had
received

when

own
son
was
born
he
baptized
him
in
the
name
of
the
holy
trinity
and
gave
him
the
christian
name
of
his
own
loved
brother
ludovico

earnestly
he
asked
a
blessing
on
his
child

prayed

tisquantum
still
sat
dozing
on
his
favorite
seat
before
his
dwelling
and
henrich
and
oriana
remained
beside
him
silently
watching
the
peaceful
slumbers
of
their
venerable
parent
and
the
playful
sports
of
their
child
who
was
again
roiling
on
the
soft
green
turf
at
their
feet
and
busily
engaged
in
decking
the
shaggy
head
and
neck
of
a
magnificent
dog
with
the
gay
flowers
that
were
scattered
around
him
it
was
rodolph
the
faithful
rodolph
who
had
once
saved
henrich
life
from
the
treacherous
designs
of
coubitant
and
who
had
often
since
proved
his
guard
and
his
watchful
protector
in
many
seasons
of
peril
and
difficulty
his
devotion
to
his
master
was
as
strong
as
ever
and
his
strength
and
swiftness
were
still
unabated
whether
in
the
flood
or
the
field
but
years
had
somewhat
subdued
the
former
restless
activity
of
his
spirits
and
now
that
he
had
dwelt
so
long
in
a
settled
home
his
manners
had
become
so
domestic
that
he
seemed
to
think
his
chief
duty
consisted
in
amusing
the
little
ludovico
and
carrying
him
about
on
his
bread
shaggy
shoulders
where
he
looked
like
the
infant
hercules
mounted
on
his
lion
they
were
indeed
a
picturesque
pair
and
no
wonder
that
the
young
parents
of
the
beautiful
child
smiled
as
they
watched
him
wreathing
his
little
hands
in
the
long
curling
mane
of
the
animal
and
laying
his
soft
rosy
cheek
on
his
back
such
was
the
group
that
occupied
the
small
cultivated
spot
in
front
of
the
chief
lodges
of
the
village
and
thus
happy
and
tranquil
might
they
have
remained
until
the
fading
light
had
warned
oriana
that
it
was
time
to
lay
her
child
to
rest
in
his
mossy
bed
and
to
prepare
the
usual
meal
for
her
husband
and
her
father
but
they
were
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
jyanough
and
mailah
accompanied
by
the
young
lincoya
and
also
by
a
stranger
whose
form
seemed
familiar
to
them
but
whose
features
the
shadow
of
the
trees
prevented
them
at
first
from
recognizing
but
as
the
party
approached
a
chill
struck
into
the
heart
of
oriana
and
she
instinctively
clung
closer
to
her
husband
arm
as
if
she
felt
that
some
danger
threatened
him
while
the
open
manly
brow
of
henrich
contracted
for
an
instant
and
was
crossed
by
a
look
of
doubt
and
suspicion
that
was
seldom
seen
to
darken
it
and
could
not
rest
there
long
in
a
moment
that
cloud
had
passed
away
and
he
rose
to
greet
the
stranger
with
a
frank
and
dignified
courtesy
that
showed
he
felt
suspicion
and
distrust
to
be
unworthy
of
him
rodolph
also
seemed
to
be
affected
by
the
same
kind
of
unpleasant
sensations
that
were
felt
by
his
more
intellectual
but
not
more
sagacious
no
sooner
did
the
stranger
advance
beyond
the
shadow
of
trees
and
thus
afford
the
dog
a
full
view
of
his
very
peculiar
and
striking
countenance
than
he
uttered
a
low
deep
growl
of
anger
and
slowly
rising
from
the
ground
placed
himself
between
his
little
charge
and
the
supposed
enemy
on
whom
he
kept
his
keen
eye
immovably
fixed
while
his
strong
white
teeth
were
displayed
in
a
very
formidable
row
coubitant
for
it
could
be
no
other
than
he
saw
clearly
the
impression
that
his
appearance
had
excited
on
the
assembled
party
of
his
old
acquaintances
but
he
was
an
adept
in
dissimulation
and
he
entirely
concealed
his
feelings
under
the
garb
of
pleasure
at
this
reunion
after
so
long
a
separation
the
candid
disposition
of
henrich
rendered
him
liable
to
be
deceived
by
these
false
professions
of
his
former
rival
and
he
readily
believed
that
coubitant
had
during
his
absence
of
so
many
years
forgotten
and
laid
aside
all
those
feelings
of
envy
and
jealousy
that
once
appeared
to
fill
his
breast
and
to
actuate
him
to
deeds
of
enmity
towards
the
white
stranger
whose
father
had
slain
his
chosen
friend
and
companion
but
was
it
so
had
the
cruel
and
wily
savage
indeed
become
the
friend
of
him
who
had
he
deemed
supplanted
him
not
only
in
the
favor
of
his
chief
but
also
in
the
good
graces
of
his
intended
bride
and
who
was
now
as
he
had
learnt
from
jyanough
the
husband
of
oriana
and
the
virtual
sachem
of
tisquantum
subject
warriors
no
is
cruel
as
the
grave
the
coals
thereof
are
coals
of
fire
which
hath
a
most
vehement
flame
and
in
the
soul
of
coubitant
there
dwelt
no
gentle
principles
of
mercy
and
forgiveness
to
quench
this
fiery
flame
he
was
a
heathen
and
in
his
eyes
revenge
was
a
virtue
and
the
gratification
of
it
a
deep
joy
and
in
the
hope
of
attaining
this
joy
he
was
willing
to
endure
years
of
difficulty
and
disappointment
and
to
forego
all
that
he
knew
of
home
and
of
comfort
therefore
had
he
left
the
tribe
of
his
adoption
and
the
friends
of
his
choice
and
dwelt
for
so
many
winters
and
summers
among
the
narragansetts
until
he
had
acquired
influence
in
their
councils
and
won
for
himself
rank
in
their
tribe
and
all
this
rank
and
influence
he
had
as
we
have
seen
exerted
to
procure
the
destruction
of
the
white
men
because
one
of
their
number
had
caused
the
death
of
his
friend
and
he
had
vowed
to
be
revenged
on
the
race
he
hated
the
and
he
hated
their
religion
and
their
peaceable
disposition
which
he
considered
to
be
merely
superstition
and
cowardice
and
now
that
he
had
failed
in
all
his
schemes
for
their
annihilation
all
his
hatred
was
concentrated
against
henrich
and
he
resolved
once
more
to
seek
him
out
and
by
again
uniting
himself
to
the
band
of
nausetts
under
tisquantum
to
find
an
opportunity
of
ridding
himself
of
one
who
seemed
born
to
cross
his
path
and
blight
his
prospects
in
life
until
coubitant
had
traced
his
old
associates
through
many
forests
and
over
many
plains
and
had
at
length
found
the
place
of
their
present
abode
he
knew
not
that
all
his
former
hopes
of
becoming
the
law
and
succeeding
to
his
dignity
were
already
blasted
by
the
marriage
of
oriana
to
henrich
and
the
association
of
the
latter
in
the
cares
and
the
honors
of
the
chieftainship
for
some
years
after
his
abrupt
departure
from
the
nausetts
and
while
he
was
striving
for
distinction
as
well
as
for
revenge
among
the
narragansetts
he
had
contrived
from
time
to
time
to
obtain
information
of
the
proceedings
of
those
whom
he
had
thought
it
politic
to
leave
for
a
time
and
as
he
found
that
no
steps
were
taken
towards
connecting
the
stranger
with
the
family
of
the
sachem
by
marriage
after
he
had
attained
the
age
at
which
indian
youths
generally
take
wives
and
it
was
even
reported
that
tisquantum
designed
to
unite
him
to
the
widow
of
lincoya
his
jealous
fears
were
hushed
to
sleep
and
he
still
hoped
to
succeed
ultimately
in
his
plans
it
was
not
that
he
loved
oriana
his
heart
was
incapable
of
that
sentiment
which
alone
is
worthy
of
the
name
but
he
had
set
his
mind
on
obtaining
her
because
she
was
in
every
way
superior
to
the
rest
of
her
young
companions
and
because
such
a
union
would
aggrandize
him
in
the
estimation
of
the
tribe
and
tend
to
further
his
views
of
becoming
their
chief
after
the
failure
of
his
schemes
for
the
utter
destruction
of
the
british
settlements
and
all
his
malicious
designs
against
rodolph
in
particular
his
personal
views
with
regard
to
oriana
and
henrich
and
his
desire
to
rule
in
tisquantum
stead
returned
to
his
mind
with
unabated
force
and
he
resolved
again
to
join
the
sachem
and
endeavor
to
regain
his
former
influence
over
him
and
the
consideration
in
which
he
had
once
been
held
by
his
but
the
removal
of
the
tribe
to
the
north
and
their
frequent
journeyings
from
place
to
place
had
for
a
great
length
of
time
baffled
his
search
and
when
at
last
he
was
successful
and
a
nausett
hunter
who
had
been
dispatched
from
paomet
on
an
errand
to
tisquantum
met
him
and
guided
him
to
the
encampment
it
was
only
to
have
all
his
hopes
dashed
for
ever
to
the
ground
and
his
soul
more
inflamed
with
wrath
and
malice
than
ever
on
reaching
the
nausett
village
coubitant
had
met
jyanough
and
been
conducted
by
him
to
his
hut
where
he
learnt
from
him
and
mailah
all
that
had
happened
to
themselves
and
their
friends
since
he
had
lost
sight
of
them
and
it
had
required
all
the
habitual
command
and
habit
of
dissimulation
to
enable
him
to
conceal
his
fury
and
disappointment
he
did
conceal
them
however
and
so
effectually
that
both
the
cree
and
his
wife
were
deceived
and
though
that
the
narrative
excited
in
him
no
deeper
interest
than
former
intimacy
would
naturally
create
but
this
was
far
from
being
the
case
oriana
and
the
chieftainship
were
lost
to
him
at
present
it
is
true
but
revenge
might
still
be
his
that
prize
that
satan
holds
out
to
his
slaves
to
tempt
them
on
to
further
guilt
and
ruin
to
win
that
prize
and
possibly
even
more
than
that
was
worth
some
further
effort
and
deceit
was
no
great
effort
to
coubitant
so
he
smiled
in
return
to
henrich
greeting
and
tried
to
draw
oriana
into
friendly
conversation
by
noticing
her
lovely
boy
who
however
received
his
advances
with
a
very
bad
grace
he
also
addressed
tisquantum
with
all
that
respectful
deference
that
is
expected
by
an
aged
indian
more
especially
a
sachem
from
the
younger
members
of
his
race
and
at
length
he
succeeded
in
banishing
from
the
minds
of
almost
all
his
former
acquaintances
those
doubts
and
suspicions
that
his
conduct
had
once
aroused
and
he
was
again
admitted
to
the
same
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
chief
and
his
family
that
he
had
enjoyed
in
years
long
gone
by
still
there
was
one
who
could
not
put
confidence
in
friendly
manner
or
believe
that
the
feelings
of
enmity
he
once
so
evidently
entertained
towards
henrich
were
altogether
banished
from
his
mind
this
was
jyanough
whose
devoted
attachment
to
the
white
stranger
had
first
led
him
to
mistrust
his
rival
and
who
still
resolved
to
watch
his
movements
with
jealous
care
and
if
possible
to
guard
his
friend
from
any
evil
that
might
be
designed
against
him
for
some
time
he
could
detect
nothing
in
coubitant
manner
or
actions
that
could
in
any
way
confirm
his
suspicions
which
he
did
not
communicate
to
any
one
but
mailah
for
he
felt
it
would
be
ungenerous
to
fill
the
minds
of
others
with
the
doubts
that
he
could
not
banish
from
his
own
the
summer
advanced
and
became
one
of
extreme
heat
the
winding
stream
that
flowed
through
the
meadow
on
the
skirts
of
which
the
nausett
encampment
was
formed
gradually
decreased
from
the
failure
of
the
springs
that
supplied
it
until
at
length
its
shallow
waters
were
reduced
to
a
rippling
brook
so
narrow
that
young
lincoya
could
leap
over
it
and
rodolph
could
carry
his
little
charge
across
without
any
risk
of
wetting
his
feet
the
long
grass
and
beautiful
lilies
and
other
wild
flowers
that
had
grown
so
luxuriantly
along
the
brink
now
faded
for
want
of
moisture
and
the
fresh
verdure
of
the
meadow
was
changed
to
a
dry
and
dusky
yellow
day
by
day
the
brook
dried
up
and
it
became
necessary
for
the
camp
to
be
removed
to
some
more
favored
spot
where
the
inhabitants
and
their
cattle
could
still
find
a
sufficient
supply
of
water
for
this
purpose
it
was
resolved
to
migrate
southwards
to
the
banks
of
the
broad
missouri
which
no
drought
could
sensibly
affect
and
there
to
remain
until
the
summer
heat
had
passed
away
and
the
season
for
travelling
had
arrived
then
tisquantum
purposed
to
bend
his
steps
once
more
towards
the
land
of
his
birth
that
he
might
end
his
days
in
his
native
paomet
and
behold
the
home
of
his
fathers
before
his
death
to
this
plan
henrich
gave
a
glad
assent
for
he
surely
hoped
that
when
he
reached
a
district
that
bordered
so
nearly
on
the
british
territories
he
should
be
able
to
obtain
some
information
respecting
his
relatives
and
perhaps
even
to
see
them
and
oriana
no
longer
dreaded
returning
to
the
dwellings
of
her
childhood
for
she
felt
assured
notwithstanding
the
occasional
misgivings
that
troubled
her
anxious
heart
that
henrich
loved
her
far
too
well
ever
to
desert
her
and
that
he
loved
truth
too
well
ever
to
take
her
from
her
aged
father
let
the
temptation
be
never
so
great
all
therefore
looked
forward
with
satisfaction
to
the
autumn
when
the
long
journey
towards
the
east
was
to
commence
but
they
well
knew
that
its
accomplishment
would
occupy
several
seasons
for
the
movement
of
so
large
a
party
of
every
age
and
sex
and
the
transport
of
all
their
baggage
across
a
district
of
many
hundreds
of
miles
in
extent
must
necessarily
be
extremely
slow
and
interrupted
by
many
pauses
for
rest
as
well
as
by
the
heat
or
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
coubitant
also
expressed
his
pleasure
at
the
proposed
change
which
would
afford
occupation
and
excitement
to
his
restless
spirit
and
which
likewise
promised
him
better
opportunities
for
carrying
out
his
ultimate
schemes
than
he
could
hope
for
in
his
present
tranquil
mode
of
life
his
constant
attention
to
tisquantum
and
his
assiduous
care
to
consult
his
every
wish
and
desire
had
won
upon
the
old
man
feelings
and
he
again
regarded
him
rather
as
the
proved
friend
of
his
lost
tekoa
than
as
the
suspected
foe
of
his
adopted
son
henrich
he
frequently
employed
him
in
executing
any
affairs
in
which
he
still
took
an
active
interest
and
he
soon
came
to
be
looked
upon
by
the
tribe
as
a
sort
of
coadjutor
to
their
white
sachem
and
the
confidential
friend
of
the
old
chieftain
this
was
just
what
coubitant
desired
and
he
lost
no
opportunity
of
strengthening
his
influence
over
the
nausett
warriors
and
making
his
presence
agreeable
and
necessary
to
tisquantum
the
time
appointed
for
the
breaking
up
of
the
encampment
drew
near
and
both
henrich
and
oriana
felt
much
regret
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
peaceful
home
where
they
had
spent
so
many
happy
days
and
where
their
little
ludovico
had
been
born
their
comfortable
and
substantial
lodge
shaded
with
the
plants
that
decorated
it
so
profusely
and
so
gaily
had
been
the
most
permanent
dwelling
that
they
had
ever
known
since
their
childhood
and
though
they
hoped
eventually
to
enjoy
a
still
more
settled
home
they
could
not
look
on
this
work
of
their
own
labor
and
taste
without
affection
or
leave
it
for
ever
without
sorrow
in
order
to
lessen
the
fatigue
of
tisquantum
it
was
arranged
at
the
suggestion
of
coubitant
that
he
should
precede
the
old
sachem
and
his
immediate
family
and
attendants
to
the
place
of
their
intended
encampment
and
should
select
a
suitable
situation
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
where
he
and
the
nansett
warriors
could
fell
timber
and
prepare
temporary
huts
for
their
reception
this
part
of
the
country
was
familiar
to
him
as
he
had
traveled
through
it
and
dwelt
among
its
plains
and
its
woods
in
the
days
of
his
wandering
youth
and
he
gave
henrich
minute
directions
as
to
the
route
he
must
take
in
order
to
follow
him
to
the
river
which
he
said
lay
about
three
days
journey
to
the
southward
to
the
south
of
the
present
encampment
arose
a
considerable
eminence
that
was
thickly
wooded
to
the
summit
on
the
side
that
overlooked
the
nausett
village
and
partially
sheltered
it
from
the
heat
of
the
summer
sun
on
the
other
side
it
was
broken
into
steep
precipices
and
its
banks
were
scantily
clothed
with
shrubs
and
grass
which
the
unusual
drought
had
now
rendered
dry
and
withered
a
winding
and
narrow
path
round
the
foot
of
this
hill
was
the
only
road
that
led
immediately
into
the
plain
below
and
by
this
path
coubitant
proposed
to
conduct
the
tribe
in
order
to
avoid
a
long
detour
to
the
west
where
a
more
easy
road
would
have
been
found
he
described
it
to
henrich
who
had
often
been
to
the
summit
of
the
range
of
hills
that
overlooked
it
in
pursuit
of
game
but
who
was
ignorant
of
the
proposed
route
into
the
missouri
district
and
after
some
conversation
on
the
subject
he
proposed
that
the
young
sachem
should
accompany
him
the
following
morning
to
the
brow
of
the
mountain
from
whence
he
could
point
out
to
him
the
road
he
must
take
through
the
broken
and
undulating
ground
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
the
exact
direction
he
must
follow
after
he
reached
the
wide
and
trackless
prairie
that
intervened
between
that
range
and
the
hills
that
bordered
the
missouri
at
break
of
day
the
march
of
the
tribe
was
to
commence
but
as
several
of
the
nausetts
were
acquainted
with
the
intricate
path
round
the
base
of
the
hills
it
was
not
necessary
for
coubitant
to
lead
them
that
part
of
their
journey
in
person
he
therefore
proposed
after
pointing
out
to
henrich
all
the
necessary
which
could
be
so
well
observed
from
the
summit
to
find
his
own
way
down
the
steep
side
of
the
rugged
precipice
and
rejoin
the
party
in
the
plain
this
plan
was
agreed
to
and
coubitant
invited
oriana
to
accompany
her
husband
that
she
also
might
see
and
admire
the
extensive
view
that
was
visible
from
the
heights
and
observe
the
track
that
her
countrymen
would
follow
through
the
valley
beneath
oriana
readily
acceded
to
this
proposal
not
only
because
she
loved
to
go
by
henrich
side
wherever
she
could
be
his
companion
but
also
because
in
spite
of
the
present
friendly
terms
to
which
coubitant
was
admitted
by
her
father
and
henrich
she
never
felt
quite
easy
when
the
latter
was
alone
with
the
warrior
the
morning
was
clear
and
bright
and
before
the
sun
had
risen
far
above
the
horizon
and
ere
the
sultry
heat
of
the
day
had
commenced
coubitant
came
to
henrich
lodge
and
summoned
him
and
his
wife
to
their
early
walk
up
the
mountain
with
light
and
active
steps
they
took
their
way
through
the
wood
and
rodolph
followed
close
behind
them
not
now
bounding
and
harking
with
joy
but
at
a
measured
pace
and
with
his
keen
bright
eye
ever
fixed
on
coubitant
in
passing
through
the
scattered
village
of
huts
the
dwelling
of
jyanough
lay
near
the
path
coubitant
ceased
to
speak
as
he
and
his
companions
approached
it
and
oriana
thought
he
quickened
his
pace
and
glanced
anxiously
at
the
dwelling
as
if
desirous
to
pass
it
unobserved
by
its
inmates
if
such
was
his
wish
he
was
however
disappointed
for
just
as
the
party
were
leaving
it
behind
them
they
heard
the
short
sharp
bark
of
rodolph
at
the
wigwam
door
and
immediately
afterwards
the
answering
voice
of
jyanough
my
old
fellow
is
it
you
exclaimed
the
cree
as
he
came
forth
from
his
hut
and
looked
anxiously
at
his
friends
who
now
to
coubitant
inward
vexation
stood
to
greet
him
are
you
off
to
so
early
he
inquired
of
henrich
and
why
is
coubitant
not
leading
our
warriors
on
their
way
are
but
going
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
replied
henrich
coubitant
may
point
out
to
me
the
path
by
which
we
are
to
follow
him
he
will
then
join
his
party
in
the
plain
and
i
will
quickly
return
to
accompany
you
on
our
projected
hunting
scheme
we
must
add
to
our
stock
of
provisions
before
we
commence
our
journey
will
ascend
the
hill
with
you
said
jyanough
and
coubitant
saw
that
he
took
a
spear
in
his
hand
from
the
door
of
the
wigwam
forcing
a
smile
he
observed
as
if
carelessly
is
needless
my
friend
henrich
eye
is
so
good
that
he
will
readily
understand
all
the
directions
that
i
shall
give
him
do
you
doubt
the
skill
of
our
young
sachem
to
lead
his
people
through
the
woods
and
the
savannas
being
as
great
as
his
prowess
in
war
and
his
dexterity
in
hunting
let
him
show
that
he
is
an
indian
indeed
and
wants
no
aid
in
performing
an
indian
duties
it
so
answered
jyanough
and
he
laid
aside
the
spear
and
reentered
the
hut
rather
to
henrich
surprise
and
disappointment
but
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
coubitant
rodolph
seemed
displeased
at
this
change
in
the
apparent
intentions
of
his
friend
and
he
lingered
a
few
moments
at
the
door
of
the
lodge
looking
wistfully
at
its
master
but
jyanough
bade
him
go
and
a
call
from
henrich
soon
brought
him
again
to
his
former
position
and
his
watchful
observation
of
every
movement
of
coubitant
the
brow
of
the
hill
was
gained
and
so
grand
and
extensive
was
the
view
to
the
south
and
west
that
oriana
stood
for
some
time
contemplating
it
with
a
refined
pleasure
and
forgot
every
feeling
that
could
interrupt
the
pure
and
lofty
enjoyment
beneath
the
precipitous
hill
on
which
she
stood
a
plain
or
wide
savanna
stretched
away
for
many
miles
covered
with
the
tall
now
dry
and
yellow
and
waving
gracefully
in
the
morning
breeze
its
flat
monotony
was
only
broken
by
a
few
clumps
of
trees
and
shrubs
that
almost
looked
like
distant
vessels
crossing
the
wide
trackless
sea
but
to
the
west
this
plain
was
bounded
by
a
range
of
hills
on
which
the
rising
sun
shed
a
brilliant
glow
marking
their
clear
outline
against
the
deep
blue
sky
behind
and
nearer
to
the
hill
from
which
she
looked
the
character
of
the
view
was
different
but
not
less
interesting
it
seemed
as
if
some
mighty
convulsion
of
nature
had
torn
away
the
side
of
the
hill
and
strewed
the
fragments
in
huge
end
broken
masses
in
the
valley
beneath
over
these
crags
the
hand
of
nature
had
spread
a
partial
covering
of
moss
and
creeping
plants
and
many
trees
had
grown
up
amongst
them
striking
their
roots
deeply
into
the
crevices
and
adorning
their
rough
surfaces
by
their
waving
and
pendant
boughs
through
the
valley
a
narrow
and
intricate
path
had
been
worn
by
the
feet
of
the
wandering
natives
and
by
the
constant
migrations
of
the
herds
of
wild
animals
that
inhabited
the
prairie
in
search
of
water
or
of
fresher
herbage
during
the
parching
heat
of
an
indian
summer
along
this
difficult
path
the
nausett
warriors
and
their
families
were
now
slowly
winding
their
way
many
of
them
on
horseback
followed
by
their
squaws
and
their
children
on
foot
and
others
less
barbarous
leading
the
steeds
on
which
the
women
and
infants
were
placed
on
the
summit
of
a
pile
of
baggage
and
carrying
their
own
bows
and
quivers
and
long
and
slender
spears
it
was
a
picturesque
scene
and
the
low
chanting
song
of
the
distant
indians
to
which
their
march
kept
time
sounded
sweetly
though
mournfully
as
it
rose
on
the
breeze
to
the
elevated
position
occupied
by
oriana
and
her
two
companions
the
latter
seemed
fully
occupied
the
one
in
pointing
out
and
the
other
in
observing
the
route
of
the
travelers
but
the
eye
of
henrich
was
not
unobservant
of
the
beauties
of
the
prospect
and
that
of
coubitant
was
restlessly
roving
to
and
fro
with
quick
and
furtive
glances
that
seemed
to
indicate
some
secret
purpose
and
to
be
watching
for
the
moment
to
effect
it
some
of
the
nausetts
in
the
path
below
looked
upwards
and
observing
their
young
sachem
and
his
companions
they
raised
a
shout
of
recognition
that
caused
the
rocks
to
echo
and
also
made
the
brows
of
coubitant
to
contract
he
saw
that
he
must
delay
his
purpose
until
the
travelers
were
out
of
sight
and
this
chafed
his
spirit
but
he
controlled
it
and
proposed
to
henrich
and
oriana
to
seat
themselves
on
the
verge
of
the
precipice
and
watch
the
course
of
the
travelers
while
he
went
to
reconnoiter
the
steep
path
by
which
he
designed
to
join
them
they
did
so
and
the
hushes
that
grew
to
the
edge
of
the
steep
declivity
shaded
the
spot
and
hid
them
from
the
retreating
form
of
coubitant
for
some
time
they
sat
together
admiring
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
them
and
watching
the
long
procession
in
the
defile
below
as
it
wound
indian
file
between
the
rocks
and
tangled
bushes
that
cumbered
the
vale
until
it
was
almost
out
of
sight
rudolph
lay
beside
them
apparently
asleep
but
the
slumber
of
a
faithful
is
always
light
and
rodolph
was
one
of
the
most
vigilant
of
his
race
why
did
he
now
utter
a
low
uneasy
moan
as
if
he
dreamt
of
danger
it
was
so
low
that
if
henrich
heard
it
he
did
not
pay
any
heed
to
it
and
continued
talking
to
oriana
of
their
approaching
journey
and
of
their
plans
for
the
future
in
perfect
security
but
their
conversation
was
suddenly
and
painfully
interrupted
a
fierce
bark
from
rodolph
as
he
sprang
on
some
one
in
the
bush
close
beside
henrich
and
the
grasp
of
a
powerful
hand
upon
his
shoulder
at
the
same
instant
caused
the
young
sachem
to
glance
round
he
found
himself
held
to
the
ground
by
coubitant
who
was
endeavoring
to
force
him
over
the
precipice
and
would
from
the
suddenness
and
strength
of
the
attack
have
undoubtedly
succeeded
but
for
the
timely
aid
of
rodolph
who
had
seized
on
his
left
arm
and
held
it
back
in
his
powerful
jaws
he
was
however
unable
to
displace
the
savage
or
release
his
master
from
the
perilous
situation
in
which
he
was
placed
and
owing
to
the
manner
in
which
henrich
had
seated
himself
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
rock
that
overhung
the
precipice
it
was
out
of
his
power
to
spring
to
his
feet
or
offer
any
effectual
resistance
the
slender
but
not
feeble
arm
of
oriana
as
she
clung
frantically
to
her
husband
and
strove
to
draw
him
back
to
safety
was
apparently
the
only
human
power
that
now
preserved
him
from
instant
destruction
not
a
sound
was
uttered
by
one
of
the
struggling
group
scarcely
a
breath
was
drawn
so
intense
was
the
mental
emotion
and
the
muscular
effort
that
nerved
every
fiber
during
these
awfully
protracted
moments
but
help
was
nigh
he
in
whose
hands
are
the
lives
of
his
creatures
sent
aid
when
aid
was
so
needful
a
loud
cry
was
heard
in
the
thicket
and
as
coubitant
made
one
more
desperate
effort
to
hurl
his
detested
rival
from
the
rock
and
almost
succeeded
in
flinging
the
whole
group
together
into
the
depths
below
he
felt
himself
encircled
by
arms
as
muscular
as
his
own
and
suddenly
dragged
backwards
henrich
sprang
on
the
firm
ground
and
beheld
his
faithful
friend
jyanough
in
fierce
conflict
with
the
treacherous
coubitant
and
powerfully
assisted
by
rodolph
who
had
loosed
the
murderer
arm
but
continued
to
assail
and
wound
him
as
he
struggled
to
draw
his
new
antagonist
to
the
brink
and
seemed
resolved
to
have
one
victim
even
if
he
shared
the
same
dreadful
fate
himself
henrich
flew
to
the
aid
of
his
friend
leaving
oriana
motionless
and
almost
breathless
on
the
spot
where
she
had
endured
such
agony
of
mind
and
such
violent
bodily
exertion
for
once
her
strength
and
spirit
failed
her
for
the
trial
had
been
too
great
and
faintness
overcame
her
as
she
saw
her
husband
again
approach
his
deadly
and
now
undisguised
foe
coubitant
saw
her
sink
to
the
ground
and
with
a
mighty
effort
he
shook
off
the
grasp
of
jyanough
and
darted
towards
oriana
he
had
thought
to
carry
her
off
a
living
prize
after
the
murder
of
her
husband
but
now
his
only
hope
was
vengeance
and
her
destruction
would
be
vengeance
indeed
on
henrich
but
love
is
stronger
even
than
hate
the
arms
of
henrich
snatched
his
unconscious
wife
from
the
threatened
peril
and
as
he
bore
her
away
from
the
scene
of
conflict
jyanough
again
closed
on
the
villain
and
the
deadly
struggle
was
resumed
it
was
brief
but
awful
the
strength
of
coubitant
was
becoming
exhausted
his
grasp
began
to
loosen
and
his
foot
to
falter
him
cried
henrich
as
he
saw
the
combatants
on
the
verge
of
the
craggy
platform
and
feared
they
would
fall
together
on
the
rocks
beneath
him
and
secure
him
for
the
judgement
of
tisquantum
and
again
he
laid
oriana
on
the
ground
and
rushed
to
save
alike
his
friend
and
foe
dies
exclaimed
jyanough
him
meet
the
fate
he
merits
and
springing
backwards
himself
he
dashed
his
antagonist
over
the
rock
one
moment
henrich
saw
his
falling
form
and
met
the
still
fiery
glance
of
that
matchless
eye
the
next
he
heard
the
crash
of
breaking
branches
and
listened
for
the
last
fatal
sound
of
the
expiring
body
on
the
rocks
below
but
the
depth
was
too
great
an
awful
stillness
followed
and
though
henrich
strove
to
look
downwards
and
ascertain
the
fate
of
his
departed
foe
the
boughs
and
creepers
that
clothed
the
perpendicular
face
of
the
rock
entirely
prevented
his
doing
so
is
gone
he
exclaimed
and
not
in
a
voice
of
either
joy
or
triumph
for
his
soul
was
moved
within
him
at
the
appalling
fate
of
such
a
man
as
coubitant
and
at
such
a
moment
is
gone
to
his
last
account
and
o
what
fearful
passions
were
in
his
heart
thank
god
he
did
not
drag
you
with
him
to
death
my
faithful
jyanough
but
tell
me
he
added
as
they
returned
together
to
where
oriana
lay
still
unconscious
of
the
dreadful
tragedy
that
had
just
been
enacted
so
near
her
tell
me
my
friend
how
it
was
that
you
were
so
near
at
hand
when
danger
which
i
could
not
repel
hung
over
me
and
your
hand
was
interposed
to
save
me
mind
misgave
me
that
some
treachery
was
intended
replied
jyanough
i
saw
that
wily
serpent
leading
you
to
the
brow
and
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
by
his
evident
reluctance
to
my
joining
the
party
rodolph
expressive
countenance
told
me
too
that
there
was
danger
to
be
feared
and
no
red
man
can
excel
rodolph
in
sagacity
so
i
resolved
to
be
at
hand
if
succor
should
be
needed
and
having
waited
till
you
were
all
fairly
out
of
sight
and
hearing
i
followed
slowly
and
stealthily
and
reached
the
verge
of
the
thicket
just
in
time
to
hear
the
warning
cry
of
your
noble
dog
and
see
that
dastardly
villain
spring
upon
you
from
the
bush
the
rest
you
know
and
now
you
will
believe
me
when
i
own
my
conviction
that
your
destruction
has
been
his
object
since
the
time
i
joined
your
camp
and
that
to
accomplish
it
and
obtain
possession
of
oriana
he
returned
to
tisquantum
tribe
and
has
worn
the
mask
of
friendship
for
so
many
months
my
soul
is
relieved
of
a
burden
by
his
death
and
forgive
me
henrich
if
i
own
that
i
glory
in
having
executed
on
him
the
vengeance
he
deserved
and
having
devoted
him
to
the
fate
he
designed
for
you
henrich
could
not
regret
the
death
however
dreadful
of
one
who
seemed
to
have
been
so
bent
on
the
destruction
of
his
happiness
and
his
life
but
the
thought
of
all
the
guilt
that
lay
on
coubitant
soul
unrepented
of
and
unatoned
saddened
and
solemnized
his
spirit
and
he
only
replied
to
jyanough
exulting
words
by
a
kindly
pressure
of
his
friend
hand
as
they
approached
oriana
her
senses
bad
returned
and
with
them
a
painful
sense
of
danger
and
of
dread
and
she
looked
anxiously
and
almost
wildly
around
her
as
henrich
knelt
beside
her
and
gently
raised
her
from
the
ground
is
he
she
exclaimed
is
that
fearful
form
and
those
eyes
of
unearthly
fire
that
glared
on
me
just
now
you
are
safe
my
henrich
she
added
and
as
she
looked
up
in
his
face
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
burst
from
her
large
expressive
eyes
and
relieved
her
bursting
heart
you
are
safe
my
henrich
and
oh
that
that
dark
form
of
dread
and
evil
might
never
never
cross
my
path
again
not
oriana
replied
jyanough
never
more
will
darken
your
way
through
life
he
has
met
the
death
he
designed
for
henrich
and
let
us
think
of
him
no
more
it
is
time
to
return
to
the
camp
and
your
husband
and
i
will
support
you
down
the
hill
am
well
quite
well
now
cried
oriana
and
she
rose
from
the
ground
and
clung
to
henrich
arm
as
if
to
assure
herself
of
his
presence
and
safety
could
walk
through
the
world
thus
supported
and
thus
guarded
too
she
added
as
she
stroked
the
head
of
the
joyous
rodolph
who
now
bounded
round
her
and
henrich
with
all
his
wonted
spirit
owe
much
to
my
two
trusty
friends
for
but
for
their
care
and
watchfulness
what
would
now
have
been
my
dreadful
fate
let
us
leave
this
spot
so
beautiful
but
now
so
full
of
fearful
images
chapter

and
thither
hither
and
thither

to

around

black

now

none
can

but
thou
anon
is
that
distant
cloud
henrich
inquired
oriana
as
they
rode
by
tisquantum
side
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
their
journey
towards
the
missouri
seems
like
the
smoke
of
an
encampment
as
i
see
it
over
the
tall
waving
grass
but
it
must
be
too
near
to
be
the
camp
of
our
people
unless
indeed
they
have
tarried
there
waiting
the
arrival
of
coubitant
who
never
will
rejoin
them
more
see
the
cloud
you
speak
of
oriana
and
i
have
been
watching
it
with
some
anxiety
for
several
minutes
it
can
not
be
what
you
suggest
for
you
know
your
father
received
a
message
from
the
trusty
salon
next
in
command
to
coubitant
to
tell
him
that
their
leader
not
having
joined
the
party
as
he
promised
a
search
had
been
made
and
his
mangled
body
found
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
where
it
was
supposed
he
must
have
fallen
in
attempting
the
sleep
descent
salon
messenger
further
stated
that
having
buried
the
corpse
where
it
lay
he
had
led
the
people
on
and
should
pursue
the
path
pointed
out
by
coubitant
and
hasten
to
prepare
the
necessary
huts
for
our
reception
i
dispatched
the
messenger
again
with
further
directions
to
salon
and
ere
this
no
doubt
the
encampment
is
formed
on
the
shores
of
the
great
river
to
which
we
are
journeying
he
added
as
he
turned
towards
tisquantum
eye
is
dim
but
your
sagacity
is
as
keen
as
ever
can
you
discern
that
rising
smoke
and
tell
us
its
cause
the
aged
sachem
had
been
riding
silently
and
abstractedly
along
the
tall
dry
grass
now
ripe
and
shedding
its
seeds
on
every
side
rose
frequently
above
his
head
for
he
was
mounted
on
a
low
strong
horse
and
he
had
not
observed
the
cloud
that
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
younger
travelers
he
now
paused
and
looked
earnestly
to
the
south
in
which
direction
the
smoke
appeared
right
before
the
advancing
party
and
from
whence
a
strong
and
sultry
wind
was
blowing
as
the
prairie
grass
rose
and
fell
in
undulating
waves
the
old
man
obtained
a
distinct
view
of
the
smoke
which
now
seemed
to
have
spread
considerably
to
the
right
and
left
and
also
to
be
approaching
towards
the
travelers
the
narrow
zigzag
track
of
the
deer
and
the
buffaloes
was
the
only
beaten
path
through
the
prairie
and
this
could
only
be
traveled
by
two
or
three
horsemen
abreast
the
old
sachem
and
henrich
and
oriana
led
the
party
and
jyanough
and
mailah
and
young
lincoya
all
well
mounted
rode
immediately
in
the
rear
the
attendants
of
the
two
families
and
a
few
experienced
warriors
some
on
foot
and
some
on
horseback
followed
in
the
winding
path
on
the
halt
of
the
foremost
rank
the
rest
rode
up
and
were
immediately
made
aware
of
the
ominous
signs
which
hitherto
they
had
not
noticed
instantly
terror
was
depicted
in
every
countenance
and
the
deep
low
voice
of
tisquantum
sank
into
every
heart
as
he
exclaimed
prairie
is
on
fire
cried
henrich
fly
let
each
horseman
take
one
of
those
on
foot
behind
and
fly
for
your
lives
cast
the
baggage
on
the
ground
stay
for
nothing
but
our
people
lives
he
was
obeyed
men
and
women
were
all
mounted
and
henrich
snatched
his
boy
from
the
arms
of
the
woman
who
carried
him
and
giving
the
child
to
oriana
took
up
the
terrified
attendant
on
his
own
powerful
steed
the
wind
rose
higher
and
now
the
roar
of
the
pursuing
flames
came
fearfully
on
the
fugitives
growing
louder
and
louder
while
volumes
of
dense
smoke
were
driven
over
their
heads
and
darkened
the
sky
that
had
so
lately
shone
in
all
its
summer
brightness
headlong
the
party
dashed
along
the
winding
path
and
sometimes
the
terrified
horses
leaped
into
the
tall
grass
seeking
a
straighter
course
or
eager
to
pass
by
those
who
had
fled
before
them
but
this
was
a
vain
attempt
the
wild
and
other
creeping
plants
that
stretched
among
the
grass
offered
such
impediments
to
rapid
flight
as
forced
them
again
into
the
path
and
now
the
wild
inhabitants
of
the
broad
savanna
came
rushing
on
and
joined
the
furious
flight
adding
difficulty
and
confusion
to
the
horror
of
the
scene
buffaloes
elks
and
antelopes
tore
madly
through
the
grass
jostling
the
horses
and
their
riders
and
leaving
them
far
in
the
rear
the
screaming
eagle
rode
high
above
among
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
many
smaller
birds
fell
suffocated
to
the
ground
while
all
the
insect
tribe
took
wing
and
everything
that
had
life
strove
to
escape
the
dread
pursuer
it
was
a
desperate
race
the
strength
of
the
fugitives
began
to
fail
and
no
refuge
no
hope
seemed
near
alas
to
some
the
race
was
lost
the
blinding
effect
of
the
dense
smoke
that
filled
the
atmosphere
the
suffocating
smell
of
the
burning
mass
of
vegetable
matter
and
the
lurid
glare
of
the
red
flames
that
came
on
so
rapidly
overpowered
alike
the
horses
and
their
riders
while
the
roaring
of
the
fire
which
sounded
like
a
mighty
rushing
cataract
and
the
oppressive
heat
seemed
to
confuse
the
senses
and
destroy
the
vital
powers
of
the
more
feeble
and
of
the
fugitives
several
of
the
horses
fell
and
their
devoted
riders
sank
to
the
ground
unable
any
longer
to
sustain
the
effort
for
life
and
henrich
had
the
agony
of
passing
by
the
wretched
victims
and
leaving
them
to
their
fate
for
he
knew
that
he
had
no
power
to
save
them
many
miles
were
traversed
and
still
the
unbroken
level
of
the
prairie
spread
out
before
them
and
still
the
roaring
and
destructive
flames
came
borne
on
the
mighty
winds
behind
them
a
few
scattered
trees
were
the
only
objects
that
broke
the
monotony
of
the
plains
and
the
hills
at
the
foot
of
which
they
had
traveled
that
morning
and
where
alone
they
could
lock
for
safety
were
still
at
a
great
distance
at
length
the
aged
tisquantum
powers
of
endurance
began
to
give
way
the
reins
almost
fell
from
his
hands
and
in
trembling
accents
he
declared
his
total
inability
to
proceed
any
further
leave
me
my
children
he
exclaimed
perish
here
for
my
strength
is
gone
and
what
matters
it
where
the
old
tisquantum
breathes
his
last
mahneto
is
here
even
in
this
awful
hour
to
receive
my
spirit
and
i
shall
but
lose
a
few
short
months
or
years
of
age
and
infirmity
my
father
cried
h
enrich
as
he
caught
the
reins
of
the
sachem
horse
and
while
he
still
urged
his
own
overloaded
steed
to
fresh
exertions
endeavored
also
to
support
the
failing
form
of
his
will
we
leave
you
to
die
alone
in
this
fiery
desert
hold
on
my
father
hold
on
yet
a
little
longer
till
we
gain
the
defile
where
the
flames
can
not
follow
as
and
all
will
yet
be
well
can
not
my
son
replied
the
old
man
my
dear
my
noble
boy
farewell
my
oriana
and
his
head
sank
down
upon
the
neck
of
his
horse
he
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
but
for
henrich
who
now
checked
the
panting
steeds
and
sprang
down
to
his
feet
in
time
to
receive
him
in
his
arms
fly
oriana
he
exclaimed
as
his
wife
also
drew
the
bridle
of
her
foaming
horse
by
his
side
oriana
my
beloved
save
your
own
life
and
that
of
our
child
if
possible
i
will
preserve
your
father
but
if
not
farewell
and
god
be
with
you
one
moment
oriana
urged
her
horse
again
to
its
swiftest
pace
as
if
in
obedience
to
her
husband
command
the
next
she
was
at
mailah
side
holding
her
infant
in
one
arm
white
with
the
other
she
guided
and
controlled
the
terrified
animal
on
which
she
rode
mailah
she
cried
and
she
clasped
the
child
to
her
breast
and
imprinted
one
passionate
kiss
on
its
cheek
take
my
ludovico
and
save
his
life
and
i
will
return
to
my
husband
and
father
if
we
follow
you
well
if
not
be
a
mother
to
my
child
and
may
the
blessing
of
god
be
on
you
she
almost
flung
the
infant
into
the
extended
arms
of
mailah
and
then
having
with
difficulty
turned
her
horse
and
forced
him
to
retrace
his
steps
she
again
rejoined
those
with
whom
she
was
resolved
to
live
or
die
one
glance
of
affectionate
reproach
she
met
from
her
henrich
eyes
but
he
did
not
speak
with
the
assistance
of
ludovico
nurse
who
rode
behind
him
he
had
just
lifted
tisquantum
to
his
own
saddle
and
was
preparing
to
mount
himself
and
endeavor
to
support
the
unconscious
old
man
and
again
commence
the
race
far
life
or
death
but
it
seemed
a
hopeless
attempt
so
utterly
helpless
was
the
sachem
and
so
unable
to
retain
his
seat
quick
as
thought
oriana
unbound
her
long
twisted
girdle
of
many
colors
and
flinging
it
to
henrich
desired
him
to
bind
the
failing
form
of
her
father
to
his
own
he
did
so
and
the
nurse
having
mounted
behind
oriana
again
the
now
furious
steeds
started
forward
all
these
actions
had
taken
less
time
to
perform
than
they
have
to
relate
but
yet
the
pursuing
flames
had
gained
much
way
and
the
flight
became
more
desperate
and
more
hazardous
again
the
prostrate
forms
of
horses
and
their
riders
met
the
eyes
of
henrich
and
oriana
but
in
the
thickness
of
the
air
and
the
wild
speed
at
which
they
were
compelled
to
pass
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
who
were
the
unhappy
victims
be
praised
at
length
henrich
exclaimed
and
they
were
the
first
words
he
had
uttered
since
the
flight
had
been
resumed
heaven
be
praised
i
see
the
rocks
dimly
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
yet
a
few
moments
and
we
shall
be
safe
already
the
grass
around
us
is
shorter
and
thinner
we
are
leaving
the
savanna
and
shall
soon
reach
the
barren
defile
where
the
flames
will
find
no
the
horses
seemed
to
know
that
safety
was
near
at
hand
for
they
bounded
forward
with
fresh
vigor
and
quickly
joined
the
group
of
breathless
fugitives
who
having
reached
the
extremity
of
the
prairie
had
paused
to
rest
from
their
desperate
exertions
and
to
look
out
for
those
of
their
companions
who
were
missing
but
who
they
hoped
would
soon
overtake
them
oriana
snatched
her
now
smiling
boy
from
mailah
arms
and
embraced
him
with
a
fervency
and
emotion
that
showed
how
little
she
had
hoped
to
see
his
face
again
but
her
own
happy
and
grateful
feelings
were
painfully
interrupted
by
her
friend
exclamation
of
agony
is
my
lincoya
she
cried
he
not
follow
with
you
i
saw
him
close
to
me
when
i
paused
to
take
your
child
and
he
is
not
here
o
my
lincoya
my
brave
my
beautiful
boy
have
you
perished
in
the
flames
with
none
to
help
you
and
she
broke
forth
into
cries
and
lamentations
that
wrung
the
heart
of
oriana
she
could
give
her
no
tidings
of
the
lost
youth
for
she
knew
not
whose
fainting
forms
she
had
passed
in
the
narrow
shrouded
path
and
it
was
utterly
impossible
now
to
go
and
seek
him
for
the
flames
had
followed
hard
upon
their
flight
and
were
still
raging
over
the
mass
of
dry
herbage
and
consuming
even
the
scattered
tufts
that
grew
among
the
stones
at
the
entrance
to
the
ravine
so
intense
was
the
heat
of
the
glowing
surface
even
after
the
blaze
had
died
away
that
it
would
not
be
practicable
to
pass
over
it
for
many
hours
and
the
party
who
had
reached
a
place
of
safety
were
compelled
to
make
arrangements
for
passing
the
night
where
they
were
not
only
that
they
might
be
ready
to
seek
the
remains
of
their
lost
friends
the
next
morning
but
also
because
their
own
weary
limbs
and
those
of
their
trembling
horses
refused
to
carry
them
any
further
all
the
provisions
and
other
baggage
which
they
had
carried
for
their
journey
had
been
abandoned
in
the
flight
end
had
become
a
rapid
prey
to
the
devouring
flames
but
several
of
the
scorched
and
affrighted
prairie
fowls
and
a
few
hares
exhausted
with
their
long
race
were
easily
secured
by
the
young
hunters
end
afforded
a
supper
to
the
weary
company
the
horses
were
then
turned
loose
to
find
fodder
for
themselves
and
to
drink
at
the
little
brook
that
still
trickled
among
the
rocks
and
large
fires
having
been
lighted
to
scare
the
wild
beasts
that
like
our
travelers
had
been
driven
for
refuge
to
the
ravine
all
lay
down
to
sleep
thankful
to
the
deities
in
whom
they
respectively
trusted
for
their
preservation
in
such
imminent
peril
fervent
were
the
prayers
and
praises
that
were
offered
up
that
night
by
the
little
band
of
christians
among
whom
henrich
always
officiated
as
minister
and
even
the
distressed
spirit
of
mailah
was
comforted
and
calmed
as
she
joined
in
his
words
of
thanksgiving
and
in
his
heartfelt
petitions
that
the
lost
lincoya
might
yet
be
restored
to
his
parents
or
that
if
his
spirit
had
already
passed
away
from
earth
it
might
have
been
purified
by
faith
and
received
into
the
presence
of
its
god
and
savior
mailah
was
tranquilized
but
her
grief
and
anxiety
were
not
removed
and
she
passed
that
sad
night
in
sleepless
reflection
on
the
dreadful
fate
of
her
only
child
and
in
sincere
endeavors
so
to
realize
and
apply
all
the
blessed
truths
she
had
learnt
from
henrich
as
to
derive
from
them
that
comfort
to
her
own
soul
and
that
perfect
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
that
she
well
knew
they
were
designed
to
afford
to
the
christian
believer
and
that
night
of
watchfulness
did
not
pass
unprofitably
to
mailah
spirit
but
where
was
lincoya
where
was
the
youth
whose
mother
mourned
him
as
dead
he
was
safe
amid
the
top
most
boughs
of
a
lonely
tree
that
now
stood
scorched
and
leafless
in
the
midst
of
the
smoldering
plain
several
miles
from
the
safe
retreat
that
had
been
gained
by
his
friends
the
horse
on
which
he
rode
that
day
though
fleet
and
active
was
young
and
uninured
to
long
continued
and
violent
exertion
and
at
length
its
foot
getting
entangled
in
some
creeping
plant
that
had
grown
across
the
pathway
it
had
fallen
violently
to
the
ground
and
thrown
its
young
rider
among
the
where
he
lay
stunned
and
unable
to
rise
until
all
his
companions
had
passed
by
then
he
regained
the
path
and
attempted
to
raise
the
exhausted
creature
from
the
earth
but
all
in
vain
its
trembling
limbs
were
unable
to
support
it
and
lincoya
saw
that
he
could
no
longer
look
to
his
favorite
steed
for
the
safety
of
his
own
life
and
must
abandon
it
to
perish
in
the
flames
but
the
boy
was
an
indian
and
accustomed
to
indian
difficulties
and
indian
expedients
he
glanced
rapidly
around
for
some
means
of
preservation
and
seeing
a
tree
of
some
magnitude
and
at
no
great
distance
he
resolved
to
try
to
reach
it
ere
the
coming
fire
had
seized
on
the
surrounding
herbage
and
seek
for
a
refuge
in
its
summit
with
much
difficulty
he
forced
his
way
through
the
tall
rank
grass
that
waved
above
his
head
and
the
wild
vines
that
were
entangled
with
it
in
every
direction
and
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
tree
just
as
the
flames
were
beginning
to
scorch
its
outmost
branches
he
sprang
upward
and
climbing
with
the
agility
of
a
squirrel
he
was
soon
in
the
highest
fork
of
the
tree
and
enabled
to
look
down
in
security
on
the
devastating
fire
beneath
him
all
around
was
one
wide
sea
of
ruddy
flames
that
shot
up
in
forked
and
waving
tongues
high
amid
the
heavy
clouds
of
smoke
happily
for
lincoya
the
herbage
beneath
his
tree
of
refuge
grew
thin
and
scanty
and
did
not
afford
much
food
for
the
devouring
elements
otherwise
it
must
have
consumed
his
retreat
and
suffocated
him
even
in
its
topmost
boughs
as
it
was
the
lower
branches
only
were
destroyed
and
the
boy
was
able
to
endure
the
heat
and
smoke
until
the
roaring
flames
had
passed
beneath
him
and
he
watched
them
driving
onward
in
the
wake
of
his
flying
friends
to
follow
his
companions
that
night
was
hopeless
for
how
could
he
traverse
that
plain
he
therefore
settled
himself
firmly
among
the
sheltering
branches
to
one
of
which
he
bound
himself
with
his
belt
of
deer
skin
and
prepared
to
pass
the
night
in
that
position
as
he
had
passed
many
similar
ones
when
he
had
been
out
on
hunting
expeditions
with
his
jyanough
long
he
gazed
on
the
strange
aspect
of
the
wide
savanna
as
it
glowed
in
the
darkness
of
night
with
a
lurid
and
fearful
glare
that
only
made
the
gloom
more
visible
but
weariness
and
exhaustion
at
length
overcame
him
and
he
fell
asleep
and
did
not
awake
until
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
the
prospect
around
him
was
changed
but
the
plain
looked
even
more
dreary
and
desolate
than
it
appeared
while
the
fire
was
at
work
on
its
clothing
of
grass
now
all
was
laid
low
and
smoking
ashes
alone
covered
the
nakedness
of
the
savanna
lincoya
gazed
earnestly
in
every
direction
that
he
might
make
sure
of
the
route
he
must
follow
in
order
to
rejoin
his
friends
and
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
figures
of
two
men
approaching
towards
the
tree
in
which
he
sat
and
apparently
engage
d
in
earnest
conversation
for
a
moment
his
hopes
led
him
to
believe
that
they
were
jyanough
and
henrich
who
had
returned
probably
in
search
of
him
and
he
was
about
to
hail
them
with
a
loud
and
joyful
cry
but
the
caution
so
early
instilled
into
the
mind
of
an
indian
restrained
him
and
well
it
was
for
him
that
he
had
not
thus
given
vent
to
his
feelings
the
men
drew
nearer
and
he
saw
to
his
amazement
that
they
were
coubitant

whose
death
and
burial
had
been
so
confidently
reported

the
trusty

to
whom
the
conduct
of
the
tribe
had
been
deputed
after
the
supposed
death
of
the
appointed
leader
they
came
beneath
the
tree
and
seating
themselves
at
its
foot
proceeded
to
refresh
themselves
with
food
and
water
that
looked
tempting
to
the
eyes
of
the
fasting
and
parched
lincoya
as
he
gazed
noiselessly
and
attentively
at
their
proceedings
and
listened
to
their
discourse

gave

they

i
exult
in

has
succeeded
better
than
any
of
the
others
you
have
tried
and
i
now
gladly
hail
you
as
sachem
of
our
tribe
i
have
made
sure
of
the
fidelity
of
many
of
our
bravest
warriors
and
when
those
who
would
have
taken
the
white
man
part
and
followed
him
in
obedience
to
tisquantum
wishes
find
that
he
is
dead
they
will
readily
take
you
for
their
leader
as
the
bravest
of
our
tribe
and
the
most
determined
foe
of
the
but
it
is
possible
that
henrich
has
even
yet
escaped
us
the
bodies
that
lie
scorched
on
the
ashes
are
fewer
than
the
number
that
were
to
follow
us
we
must
therefore
take
measures
to
seize
and
destroy
those
who
yet
live
if
they
are
likely
to
disturb
our
scheme
of
course
they
will
again
set
out
on
the
same
track
as
being
that
which
will
most
quickly
bring
them
where
food
and
water
are
to
be

we
have
only
to
lie
in
wait
at
the
other
side
of
the
savanna
where
the
narrow
mountain
pass
leads
to
the
river
and
our
arrows
and
spears
will
be
sufficient
to
silence
every
tongue
that
could
speak
against

right

faithful

with
a
sign
of
warns
approbation
of
the
forethought
of
his
accomplice
us
lose
no
time
in
crossing
the
plain
for
doubtless
the
survivors
of
this
glorious
fire
will
be
early
on
their
march
and
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
overtake
us
in
the
midst
of
the
ruin
we
have
wrought
we
will
set
all
inquiries
to
rest
and
then
we
will
report
to
our
tribe
that
the
dreadful
conflagration
has
deprived
them
of
both
their
chiefs
and
that
it
rests
with
themselves
to
choose
another
o
salon
my
soul
burns
to
lead
them
to
paomet
that
stronghold
of
our
country
foes
the
murderers
arose
and
took
their
way
directly
across
the
prairie
for
all
the
rank
herbage
being
now
reduced
to
ashes
they
were
no
longer
obliged
to
follow
the
winding
course
of
the
buffalo
track
they
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
but
it
was
some
time
ere
lincoya
ventured
to
descend
from
his
as
he
feared
being
observed
on
the
level
plain
if
either
of
those
ruthless
villains
should
east
a
glance
behind
them
at
length
their
retreating
forms
appeared
to
him
like
specks
in
the
distance
and
he
came
down
from
his
and
fled
as
fast
as
his
active
young
limbs
could
carry
him
towards
the
spot
where
he
hoped
to
rejoin
his
friends
he
had
not
very
long
continued
his
flight
when
he
perceived
several
persons
on
horseback
approaching
towards
him
and
soon
he
found
himself
in
the
arms
of
his
joyful
mother
and
was
affectionately
greeted
by
jyanough
and
henrich
who
with
several
others
had
come
out
to
look
if
any
of
their
missing
companions
were
still
within
reach
of
human
aid
all
but
lincoya
had
perished
the
fire
and
the
smoke
had
not
only
destroyed
their
lives
but
had
so
blackened
and
disfigured
them
that
it
was
impossible
to
identify
a
single
individual
a
grave
was
dug
in
the
yet
warm
earth
and
all
the
victims
were
buried
sufficiently
deep
to
preserve
their
remains
from
the
ravages
of
wild
beasts
and
then
the
party
returned
in
all
haste
to
those
who
anxiously
awaited
them
at
their
place
of
refuge
on
the
way
lincoya
related
to
his
and
henrich
the
whole
of
the
conversation
which
he
had
heard
between
coubitant
and
salon
while
he
was
in
his
safe
retreat
and
their
surprise
at
finding
that
the
former
had
survived
his
desperate
fall
from
the
brow
of
the
precipice
and
still
lived
to
plan
and
work
out
schemes
of
cruelty
and
malice
was
only
equaled
by
their
indignation
at
thus
discovering
the
treachery
and
deceit
of
salon
they
had
hitherto
put
the
most
entire
confidence
in
the
fidelity
of
this
man
and
if
they
had
still
entertained
any
doubts
or
suspicions
as
to
the
honesty
of
intentions
they
had
relied
on
salon
to
discover
his
plans
and
prevent
any
mischief
being
accomplished
the
whole
story
was
told
to
tisquantum
and
his
counsel
was
asked
as
to
the
best
mode
of
now
counteracting
the
further
schemes
of
the
traitors
and
escaping
the
snare
which
they
found
was
yet
to
be
laid
for
their
destruction
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
reach
the
camp
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
by
the
path
which
coubitant
had
pointed
out
without
passing
through
the
defile
where
the
villain
and
his
confederate
now
proposed
to
lie
in
wait
for
them
and
where
in
spite
of
their
superior
numbers
many
of
their
party
would
probably
be
wounded
by
the
arrows
and
darts
of
their
hidden
foes
without
having
any
opportunity
of
defending
themselves
that
route
was
therefore
abandoned
but
the
old
sachem
remembered
having
traversed
this
part
of
the
continent
many
years
ago
and
he
knew
of
a
track
to
the
west
by
which
the
mountains
that
skirted
the
course
of
the
missouri
might
be
avoided
and
the
rivers
reached
at
a
considerable
distance
above
the
place
at
which
the
encampment
was
appointed
to
be
formed
this
road
was
indeed
much
longer
than
that
across
the
prairie
and
would
occupy
several
days
to
traverse
so
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
coubitant
would
wait
so
long
in
his
or
whether
he
would
conclude
that
the
chiefs
were
dead
and
return
to
take
the
command
of
the
tribe
nevertheless
no
other
course
was
open
and
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
the
journey
was
commenced
a
scanty
supply
of
food
was
obtained
by
the
bows
and
arrows
of
the
hunters
and
water
was
occasionally
met
with
in
the
small
rivulets
that
flowed
from
the
hills
and
wandered
on
until
they
eventually
lost
themselves
in
the
broad
missouri
inured
to
privations
and
to
toilsome
journeys
the
indian
party
heeded
them
not
but
cheerfully
proceeded
on
their
way
until
at
length
they
beheld
the
wigwams
of
their
tribe
standing
on
a
green
meadow
near
the
river
side
they
hastened
on
and
were
received
with
joyful
acclamations
by
the
inhabitants
who
had
almost
despaired
of
ever
seeing
them
again
the
conflagration
of
the
prairie
was
known
to
them
but
almost
all
of
them
were
ignorant
of
the
true
cause
of
the
awful
calamity
and
attributed
it
entirely
to
accident
nor
were
any
suspicions
aroused
in
their
minds
by
the
conduct
of
coubitant
and
salon
who
had
pretended
the
greatest
alarm
and
anxiety
for
the
fate
of
the
chiefs
and
their
party
and
had
set
out
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
to
traverse
the
savanna
in
the
hope
as
they
declared
of
rendering
assistance
to
any
of
the
sachem
company
who
might
have
survived
the
catastrophe
much
to
the
relief
of
all
the
party
they
found
that
neither
coubitant
nor
his
accomplice
had
yet
returned
to
the
camp
and
their
prolonged
absence
was
becoming
a
source
of
uneasiness
to
the
rest
of
the
tribe
who
were
preparing
to
send
out
a
party
of
men
to
search
for
them
the
very
day
that
henrich
led
his
detachment
into
the
village
it
was
agreed
by
the
sachems
and
jyanough
that
they
would
not
communicate
to
the
rest
of
their
people
all
they
had
discovered
of
the
treachery
of
coubitant
and
salon
as
they
knew
not
yet
how
many
of
the
warriors
might
have
been
induced
to
join
in
the
conspiracy
and
connive
at
their
crimes
they
therefore
accounted
for
having
traveled
by
so
circuitous
a
route
on
the
plea
of
their
inability
to
cross
the
prairie
without
any
supply
of
either
provisions
or
water
and
they
commanded
the
party
who
were
about
to
search
for
coubitant
and
salon
to
set
out
immediately
and
to
use
every
possible
exertion
to
find
them
and
bring
them
in
safety
to
the
camp
they
could
have
told
their
messengers
exactly
where
the
villains
were
to
be
found
but
that
would
have
betrayed
a
greater
knowledge
of
their
movements
than
it
would
have
been
prudent
to
disclose
and
they
only
directed
the
men
to
shout
aloud
every
now
and
then
as
they
traversed
the
mountain
passes
that
the
lost
travelers
might
know
of
their
approach
and
also
to
carry
with
them
a
supply
of
food
sufficient
to
last
several
days
the
messengers
departed
and
then
jyanough
set
himself
to
work
with
all
an
indian
sagacity
to
find
out
the
extent
to
which
the
conspiracy
had
been
carried
among
the
warriors
of
the
tribe
he
succeeded
in
convicting
four
men
of
the
design
to
elevate
coubitant
to
the
chieftainship
and
of
a
knowledge
and
participation
in
his
last
desperate
scheme
for
the
destruction
of
the
sachem
and
all
his
family
summary
justice
was
therefore
executed
on
the
culprits
who
scorned
to
deny
their
crimes
when
once
they
were
charged
with
them
and
submitted
to
the
sentence
of
their
chief
with
a
fortitude
that
almost
seemed
to
expiate
their
offence
the
most
daring
of
the
four
openly
exulted
in
his
rebellious
projects
and
boasted
of
his
hatred
towards
the
stranger
who
presumed
to
exercise
authority
over
the
free
red
men
and
tisquantum
deemed
it
politic
to
inflict
on
him
a
capital
punishment
he
was
therefore
directed
to
kneel
down
before
him
which
he
did
with
the
greatest
composure
and
the
aged
chief
then
drew
his
long
sharp
knife
and
with
a
steady
hand
and
unflinching
eye
plunged
it
into
the
heart
of
the
criminal
he
expired
without
a
groan
or
a
struggle
and
then
the
other
three
wretches
were
led
up
together
and
placed
in
the
same
humble
posture
before
the
offended
sachem
at
henrich
request
the
capital
sentence
was
remitted
but
one
of
agony
and
shame
was
inflicted
in
its
stead
one
that
is
commonly
reserved
for
the
punishment
of
repeated
cases
of
theft
the
sachem
knife
again
was
lifted
and
with
a
dexterous
movement
of
his
hand
he
slit
the
noses
of
each
of
the
culprits
from
top
to
bottom
and
dismissed
them
to
carry
for
life
the
marks
of
their
disgrace
no
cry
was
uttered
by
any
one
of
the
victims
nor
the
slightest
resistance
offered
to
their
venerable
judge
and
executioner
for
such
cowardice
would
in
the
estimation
of
the
indians
have
been
far
more
contemptible
than
the
crime
of
which
they
had
been
convicted
silently
they
withdrew
nor
did
they
even
by
the
expression
of
their
countenances
seem
to
question
the
justice
of
their
chastisement
the
next
step
to
be
pursued
was
to
prepare
for
securing
coubitant
and
salon
the
moment
they
should
make
their
appearance
in
the
camp
and
before
they
could
be
made
aware
of
the
discovery
at
their
treason
for
this
purpose
very
effectual
steps
were
taken
and
jyanough
the
faithful
and
energetic
jyanough
took
the
command
of
the
band
of
trusty
warriors
who
were
appointed
to
seize
the
leaders
of
the
conspiracy
and
to
bring
them
into
the
presence
of
the
chiefs
that
evening
soon
after
sunset
the
searching
party
returned
and
no
sooner
did
jyanough
perceive
from
the
spot
where
he
had
posted
his
men
among
the
rocks
and
bushes
that
commanded
the
pathway
that
coubitant
and
his
were
with
them
than
he
gave
the
concerted
signal
and
rushed
upon
them
in
an
instant
they
were
seized
by
the
arms
and
dragged
forcibly
forward
to
the
village
they
asked
no
questions
of
their
captors
for
conscience
told
them
that
their
sin
had
found
them
out
and
that
they
were
about
to
expiate
their
crimes
by
a
death
probably
both
lingering
and
agonizing
doggedly
they
walked
on
and
were
led
to
the
spot
where
tisquantum
and
his
awaited
their
arrival
this
was
beneath
a
spreading
tree
that
grew
near
the
banks
of
the
river
which
in
that
part
were
rather
high
and
precipitous
the
shades
of
evening
were
deepening
and
the
dark
visage
of
coubitant
looked
darker
than
ever
while
the
lurid
light
of
his
eyes
seemed
to
glow
with
even
unwonted
luster
from
beneath
his
shaggy
and
overhanging
brows
the
greatest
part
of
the
tribe
were
gathered
together
in
that
place
and
stood
silently
around
to
view
the
criminals
and
to
witness
their
expected
fate
for
now
all
were
acquainted
with
their
guilt
and
all
who
were
assembled
here
were
indignant
at
their
treachery
against
their
venerable
and
beloved
sachem
and
their
scarcely
less
respected
white
chieftain
the
voice
of
tisquantum
broke
the
ominous
silence
he
solemnly
began
have
deceived
your
chief
you
have
spoken
to
him
words
of
peace
when
death
was
in
your
heart
is
it
not
so
would
be
chief
myself
replied
the
savage
in
a
deep
undaunted
voice
was
taught
to
believe
that
i
should
succeed
you
and
a
faced
stranger
has
taken
my
place
i
have
lived
but
to
obtain
vengeance
vengeance
that
you
tisquantum
who
were
bound
to
wreak
it
on
the
slayer
of
your
son
refused
to
take
a
mighty
vengeance
was
in
my
soul
and
to
possess
it
i
would
have
sacrificed
the
whole
tribe
now
do
to
me
as
i
would
have
done
to
henrich
and
he
glared
on
his
hated
rival
with
the
eye
of
a
beast
of
prey
tisquantum
regarded
him
calmly
and
gravely
continued
his
examination
you
have
also
drawn
some
of
my
people
into
rebel
lion
and
persuaded
them
to
consent
to
the
murder
of
their
chief
one
of
them
has
already
shed
his
in
punishment
of
his
sin
and
the
rest
will
bear
the
marks
of
shame
to
their
graves
all
this
is
your
work
more
of
your
people
had
the
courage
to
join
me
in
resisting
the
pretensions
of
the
proud
stranger
you
and
henrich
would
now
have
been
lying
dead
at
my
feet
you
would
never
again
have
been
obeyed
as
sachems
by
the
nausetts
but
they
loved
their
slavery
and
let
them
keep
it
my
soul
is
free
you
may
send
it
forth
in
agony
if
you
will
for
i
am
in
your
power
and
i
ask
no
mercy
from
those
to
whom
i
would
have
shown
none
do
your
worst
coubitant
heart
is
strong
and
i
shall
soon
be
with
the
spirits
of
my
fathers
where
no
white
men
can
enter
the
wrath
of
tisquantum
was
stirred
by
the
taunts
and
the
bold
defiance
of
his
prisoner
and
he
resolved
to
execute
on
him
a
sentence
that
should
strike
terror
into
any
others
of
the
tribe
who
might
have
harbored
thoughts
of
rebellion
death
that
you
intended
should
be
my
portion
and
that
of
all
my
family
shall
be
your
own
he
exclaimed
the
torments
of
fire
shall
put
a
stop
to
your
boasting
my
children
he
added
turning
to
the
warriors
who
stood
around
him
i
call
on
you
to
do
justice
on
this
villain
form
a
pile
of
wood
here
on
the
river
brink
end
when
his
body
is
consumed
his
ashes
shall
he
cast
on
the
stream
and
go
to
tell
in
other
lands
how
tisquantum
punishes
treachery
a
smile
of
scorn
curled
the
lip
of
coubitant
but
he
spoke
not
and
no
quivering
feature
betrayed
any
inward
fear
of
the
approaching
agony
me
yet
coubitant
resumed
the
old
chieftain
and
as
he
spoke
the
strokes
of
his
warriors
hatchets
among
the
neighboring
trees
fell
on
the
victim
ear
but
did
not
seem
to
move
him
me
yet
and
answer
me
was
it
by
your
arts
that
salon
soul
was
turned
away
from
his
lawful
chief
and
filled
with
thoughts
of
murder
was
he
true
to
me
and
mine
until
you
returned
to
put
evil
thoughts
into
his
heart
or
had
pride
and
jealousy
already
crept
in
there
which
you
have
only
fostered
hugged
his
chains
till
i
showed
him
that
they
were
unworthy
of
a
indian
the
smooth
tongue
of
the
had
beguiled
him
till
i
told
him
that
it
would
lead
him
to
ruin
and
subjection
yes
i
taught
salon
to
long
for
freedom
for
himself
and
freedom
for
his
race
and
now
he
will
die
for
it
as
a
red
man
ought
to
die
let
the
same
pile
consume
us
both
interrupted
henrich
eagerly
guilt
is
far
less
than
yours
and
mercy
may
be
extended
to
him
by
every
law
of
god
and
man
your
life
coubitant
is
forfeited
and
justice
requires
that
you
should
die
but
i
would
desire
your
death
to
be
speedy
and
i
would
spare
you
all
needless
agony
my
father
he
continued
addressing
tisquantum
my
request
be
heard
in
favor
of
salon
that
he
may
live
to
become
our
trusty
friend
again
and
since
coubitant
must
die
let
it
be
by
the
quick
stroke
of
the
knife
and
not
in
the
lingering
horrors
of
the
stake
to
urge
me
my
son
replied
the
chief
in
a
tone
of
firm
determination
that
forbad
all
hope
of
success
have
said
that
coubitant
shall
die
the
death
he
intended
for
us
and
his
funeral
pile
shall
light
up
this
spot
ere
i
retire
to
my
lodge
salon
also
shall
die
but
as
he
was
deceived
by
the
greater
villain
he
shall
die
a
warriors
death
the
sachem
rose
from
his
seat
and
took
a
spear
that
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
beside
him
meet
the
stroke
like
a
man
he
cried
and
gathering
his
somewhat
failing
strength
he
bore
with
all
his
force
against
the
naked
breast
of
salon
the
gushed
forth
and
he
fell
a
corpse
upon
the
earth
drive
in
the
stake
and
heap
the
pile
exclaimed
the
aged
chieftain
in
a
clear
loud
voice
of
command
as
he
withdrew
the
bloody
lance
and
waved
it
high
above
his
head
he
was
excited
by
the
scene
he
was
enacting
and
the
feelings
of
his
race
were
aroused
within
him
with
a
violence
that
had
been
long
unknown
to
him
he
felt
the
joy
that
savage
natures
feel
in
revenging
themselves
on
their
foes
and
he
forgot
the
influence
that
henrich
example
and
precepts
of
forbearance
had
so
lung
exerted
over
his
conduct
though
they
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
changing
his
heart
the
pile
high
he
cried
let
the
flames
bring
back
the
light
of
day
and
show
me
the
death
struggles
of
him
who
would
have
slain
me
and
all
i
love
on
earth
drag
the
wretch
forward
and
bind
him
strongly
the
searching
flames
may
yet
have
power
to
conquer
his
calm
indifference
the
lighted
brand
was
ready
and
the
victim
was
led
to
the
foot
of
the
pile
a
rope
was
passed
around
his
arms
and
the
noose
was
about
to
be
drawn
tight
when
quick
as
lightning
the
devoted
victim
saw
that
there
was
yet
one
chance
for
life
the
river
was
rolling
beneath
his
feet
could
he
but
reach
it
his
arms
were
snatched
from
those
who
held
them
with
a
sudden
violence
for
which
they
were
unprepared
and
with
one
desperate
bound
the
prisoner
gained
the
steep
bank
of
the
broad
dark
stream
another
moment
and
a
heavy
plash
was
heard
in
the
waters
darkness
was
gathering
around
the
scene
and
those
who
looked
into
the
river
could
distinguish
no
human
form
on
its
surface
the
pile
cried
tisquantum
and
the
flames
burst
up
from
the
dry
crackling
wood
and
threw
a
broad
sheet
of
light
on
the
dark
stream
below
is
there
again
shouted
the
infuriated
chieftain
see
the
white
foam
that
his
rapid
strokes
leave
behind
him
send
your
arrows
after
him
my
brave
warriors
and
suffer
him
not
to
escape
ha
will
mahneto
let
him
thus
avoid
my
vengeance
the
twanged
and
the
arrows
flew
over
the
water
where
did
they
fall
not
on
coubitant
struggling
form
for
he
had
heard
the
sachem
command
and
had
dived
deeply
beneath
the
surface
of
the
water
and
changed
his
course
down
the
stream
when
he
rose
again
it
was
in
a
part
of
the
river
that
the
flames
did
not
illuminate
and
those
who
sought
his
life
saw
him
no
more
he
was
wounded
and
has
sunk
never
to
rise
again
exclaimed
henrich
doom
has
followed
him
be
praised
cried
tisquantum
i
would
i
had
seen
him
writhing
in
those
flames
and
he
turned
and
left
the
spot
coubitant
gained
the
western
shore
of
the
river
and
he
smiled
a
strange
and
ominous
smile
as
he
looked
across
the
waters
and
saw
the
forms
of
his
enemies
by
the
light
of
that
fire
which
had
been
intended
to
consume
his
quivering
flesh
and
dismiss
from
earth
his
undaunted
and
cruel
spirit
will
have
vengeance
yet
ha
muttered
and
then
he
turned
his
steps
towards
the
south
and
paused
not
until
he
had
traveled
many
miles
down
the
river
when
he
lay
down
on
its
margin
and
slept
as
soundly
as
if
no
guilt
lay
on
his
soul

leave
our

friends
and
return
to
new

and
to
comparatively
civilized
life

all
its
cares
and
anxieties
from
so
many
of
which
the
wild
tenants
of
the
woods
are
free
cares
and
anxieties
had
indeed
continued
to
be
the
portion
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
their
families
though
mingled
with
many
blessings
their
numbers
had
considerably
increased
during
the
years
that
elapsed
since
last
we
took
a
view
of
their
condition
and
their
town
bad
assumed
a
much
more
comfortable
and
imposing
appearance
many
trading
vessels
had
also
visited
the
rising
colony
from
the
and
had
brought
out
to
the
settlers
useful
supplies
of
clothing
and
other
articles
of
great
value
among
these
none
were
more
acceptable
to
the
emigrants
than
the
first
specimens
of
horned
cattle
consisting
of
three
cows
and
a
bull
that
reached
the
settlement
about
the
third
year
after
its
establishment
they
were
hailed
with
universal
joy
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
new
plymouth
who
seemed
to
feel
as
if
the
presence
of
such
old
accustomed
objects
brought
back
to
them
a
something
of
home
that
they
had
never
felt
before
in
the
land
of
their
exile
these
precious
cattle
were
a
common
possession
of
the
whole
colony
and
were
not
divided
until
the
year
when
their
numbers
had
greatly
increased
and
when
a
regular
division
of
the
houses
and
lands
also
took
place
the
trade
of
the
colony
had
likewise
been
considerably
augmented
both
with
the
indians
and
with
the
english
whose
fishing
vessels
frequented
the
coast
and
were
the
means
of
their
carrying
on
a
constant
intercourse
and
traffic
with
their
friends
at
home
one
of
these
vessels
brought
out
to
the
emigrants
the
sad
intelligence
of
the
death
of
their
beloved
pastor
john
robinson
he
who
had
been
honored
and
respected
by
every
puritan
community
whether
in
europe
or
america
and
for
whose
arrival
the
pilgrims
had
looked
with
anxious
hope
ever
since
the
day
of
their
sorrowful
parting
in
holland
as
a
friend
of
bradford
wrote
to
him
from
leyden
our
pastor
would
never
have
gone
from
hence
if
prayers
tears
or
means
of
aid
could
have
saved
him
the
consternation
of
the
settlers
was
great
indeed
year
after
year
they
had
gone
on
expecting
and
waiting
for
his
coming
to
resume
his
official
duties
among
them
and
therefore
they
had
never
taken
any
measures
to
provide
themselves
with
regular
pastors
who
might
preach
the
gospel
to
them
three
times
every
lord
day
according
to
their
custom
in
europe
and
also
administer
to
them
the
sacrament
which
previous
to
their
exile
all
the
members
of
the
community
had
habitually
received
every
sunday
the
death
of
their
spiritual
leader
and
counselor
had
destroyed
all
their
hopes
of
being
again
united
to
him
on
earth
and
the
blow
fell
heavily
on
all
and
cast
a
gloom
over
the
settlement
that
was
not
soon
dispersed
but
still
the
pilgrims
did
not
immediately
proceed
to
choose
another
minister
the
belief
that
the
divine
service
could
receive
no
part
of
its
sanctity
from
either
time
place
or
person
but
only
from
the
holy
spirit
of
god
which
hallows
it
was
then
as
it
is
now
a
leading
feature
of
the
independent
and
presbyterian
churches
of
america
and
therefore
the
puritans
of
new
plymouth
did
not
feel
it
a
necessity
although
they
deemed
it
a
to
enjoy
the
spiritual
ministrations
of
ordained
clergymen
hitherto
the
venerable
brewster
with
the
occasional
aid
of
bradford
winslow
and
a
few
others
distinguished
for
piety
and
eloquence
had
delivered
the
customary
addresses
and
prayers
and
had
performed
the
rite
of
baptism
at
length
in
the
year
allerton
the
assistant
of
bradford
after
he
had
been
on
a
mission
to
england
brought
back
with
him
a
young
preacher
of
the
name
of
rogers
who
very
shortly
gave
such
evident
signs
of
insanity
that
the
settlers
were
obliged
to
send
him
back
to
his
native
land
at
a
considerable
expense
and
trouble
in
the
meantime
the
number
of
settlers
on
other
parts
of
the
coast
of
new
england
had
augmented
to
a
great
extent
and
in
salem
alone
there
were
four
ministers
who
had
come
out
with
the
english
emigrants
of
whom
only
two
could
find
adequate
employment
one
of
the
others
therefore
named
ralph
smith
who
was
a
man
of
much
piety
and
judged
orthodox
by
the
puritans
went
to
plymouth
and
offered
himself
as
pastor
to
the
inhabitants
he
was
chosen
by
the
people
to
be
their
spiritual
leader
and
became
the

officiated
among
these
the
earliest
settlers
in
new
england
two
or
three
small
vessels
were
about
this
time
built
by
the
men
of
plymouth
for
their
own
use
and
proved
of
great
service
to
them
as
their
connection
with
other
colonies
of
europeans
on
the
american
coast
became
more
extensive
and
profitable
a
friendly
intercourse
with
the
dutch
settlers
at
the
mouth
of
the
great
river
hudson
had
also
lately
been
established
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
plymouthers
and
to
the
mutual
advantage
and
comfort
of
both
parties
it
was
commenced
by
the
men
of
holland
soon
after
their
formal
settlement
near
the
hudson
where
they
erected
a
village
and
a
fortress
called
fort
amsterdam
from
thence
they
addressed
a
courteous
letter
to
their
old
connections
the
english
exiles
from
leyden
and
invited
them
to
an
occasional
barter
of
their
respective
goods
and
productions
and
also
offered
them
their
services
in
any
other
way
that
could
be
useful
governor
bradford
who
still
by
annual
election
retained
his
important
office
returned
an
equally
friendly
reply
to
these
overtures
and
at
the
same
time
tendered
his
own
and
his
people
grateful
acknowledgements
of
all
the
kindness
and
hospitality
that
they
had
received
during
their
residence
in
holland
in
years
gone
by
the
following
year
they
were
surprised
and
gratified
by
a
visit
from
de
brazier
the
secretary
of
the
dutch
colony
who
anchored
at
manomet
a
place
twenty
miles
to
the
south
of
new
plymouth
and
from
thence
sent
to
request
the
pilgrims
to
send
a
boat
for
him
his
ship
was
well
stocked
with
such
wares
as
were
likely
to
be
acceptable
to
the
english
and
according
to
the
custom
of
the
times
he
was
attended
by
several
gaily
dressed
trumpeters
and
a
numerous
retinue
of
servants
the
new
pinnace
which
had
recently
been
built
at
manomet
was
immediately
dispatched
for
the
welcome
visitors
and
he
was
hospitably
entertained
by
his
new
friends
for
three
days
after
which
the
governor
attended
by
rodolph
and
some
others
returned
with
him
to
his
vessel
to
make
their
purchases
and
to
give
in
exchange
for
their
european
goods
such
furs
and
skins
and
tobacco
as
they
had
been
able
to
collect
in
their
general
storehouse
on
burying
hill
from
this
period
an
active
trade
was
carried
on
between
the
two
settlements
which
proved
highly
advantageous
to
both
the
dutch
supplying
the
men
of
plymouth
with
sugar
linen
and
other
stuffs
in
return
for
their
skins
timber
and
tobacco
during
all
this
time
an
almost
perfect
peace
was
maintained
with
the
neighboring
indian
tribes
and
the
friendship
that
had
so
early
been
established
between
the
english
settlers
and
the
wampanoges
became
more
confirmed
and
strengthened
all
external
matters
now
wore
a
far
more
prosperous
aspect
than
they
had
hitherto
done
and
the
pilgrims
felt
that
they
had
both
the
means
and
the
leisure
to
add
to
the
comforts
of
their
social
and
domestic
life
some
years
previously
a
small
portion
of
land
had
been
assigned
to
each
family
for
its
own
particular
use
but
the
possession
of
this
land
had
not
been
made
hereditary
and
although
the
fact
of
its
being
appropriated
to
one
household
had
considerably
increased
the
zeal
and
industry
of
the
cultivators
yet
they
still
desired
that
feeling
of
inalienable
property
which
so
greatly
adds
to
the
value
of
every
possession
to
gratify
this
natural
desire
the
governor
and
his
council
had
deemed
it
advisable
to
depart
so
far
from
the
terms
of
the
original
treaty
as
to
allot
to
each
colonist
an
acre
of
land
as
near
the
town
as
possible
in
order
that
if
any
danger
threatened
they
might
be
able
to
unite
speedily
for
the
general
defense
this
arrangement
gave
much
satisfaction
to
the
settlers
but
in
the
year
they
were
placed
in
a
still
more
comfortable
and
independent
position
they
were
by
their
charter
lords
of
all
the
neighboring
land
for
a
circle
of
more
than
one
hundred
miles
that
portion
of
their
territory
therefore
which
was
most
contiguous
to
the
town
was
divided
into
portions
of
twenty
acres
five
long
on
the
side
next
the
coast
and
four
broad
and
to
each
citizen
one
of
these
portions
was
assigned
with
the
liberty
of
purchasing
another
for
his
wife
and
also
one
for
every
child
who
resided
with
him
to
every
six
of
these
pieces
were
allotted
a
cow
two
goats
and
a
few
pigs
so
that
each
settler
became
possessed
of
a
little
farm
of
his
own
and
a
small
herd
of
cattle
to
stock
it
with
and
peace
and
plenty
at
length
seemed
to
smile
on
the
hardy
and
enduring
settlers
meanwhile
the
colony
of
massachusetts
which
had
been
founded
in
the
year
increased
rapidly
it
was
first
planted
at
nantasket
a
deserted
village
of
the
indians
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
of
massachusetts
where
the
plymouth
settlers
had
previously
erected
a
few
houses
for
the
convenience
of
carrying
on
their
trade
with
the
neighboring
tribes
another
settlement
had
been
formed
two
years
later
at
naumkeak
a
tongue
of
land
of
remarkable
fertility
where
also
a
deserted
indian
village
was
found
which
formed
the
commencement
of
the
town
afterwards
called
salem
and
which
had
become
at
the
period
we
have
now
arrived
at
in
our
story
a
place
of
some
importance
it
was
founded
by
a
man
of
much
zeal
end
enthusiasm
of
the
name
of
endicott
who
was
one
of
the
original
possessors
of
the
patent
granted
to
several
gentlemen
of
dorsetshire
for
the
land
in
massachusetts
bay
extending
from
the
merrimak
to
the
charles
river
from
north
to
south
but
stretching
to
an
indefinite
distance
westward
even
over
the
unexplored
regions
between
the
boisterous
atlantic
and
the
sea
as
the
pacific
has
been
very
aptly
and
beautifully
designated
endicott
had
been
invested
by
the
society
to
which
he
belonged
in
england
with
the
government
of
the
whole
district
of
massachusetts
and
he
soon
found
himself
called
on
to
exercise
his
authority
for
the
suppression
of
the
disturbances
excited
by
the
settlers
of
quincy
this
place
was
inhabited
by
a
set
of
low
and
immoral
men
one
of
whom
named
thomas
morton
had
come
over
in
the
wild
and
dissolute
train
sent
out
by
weston
several
years
previously
he
was
a
man
of
some
talent
but
of
very
contemptible
character
and
had
attached
himself
to
the
retinue
of
captain
wollaston
and
his
companions
who
first
settled
at
quincy
and
gave
it
the
name
of
mount
wollaston
he
afterwards
with
his
friends
removed
to
virginia
leaving
some
of
his
servants
and
an
overseer
to
manage
the
plantation
during
his
absence
but
no
sooner
was
morton
relieved
of
the
presence
of
those
who
had
hitherto
kept
him
in
some
restraint
than
he
roused
the
servants
to
a
complete
mutiny
which
ended
in
their
driving
the
overseer
from
the
plantation
and
indulging
in
every
kind
of
excess
they
even
had
the
boldness
and
the
dishonesty
to
sell
the
land
which
had
been
left
in
their
charge
by
the
lawful
possessors
to
the
indians
and
to
obtain
fresh
estates
which
they
claimed
as
their
own
and
having
thus
established
a
sort
of
lawless
independence
they
passed
their
time
in
drinking
and
wild
revelry
on
the
first
of
may
they
erected
a
in
fashion
but
not
contented
with
celebrating
that
day
of
and
flowers
with
innocent
pastimes
they
hung
the
pole
with
verses
of
an
immoral
and
impious
character
and
inviting
the
ignorant
heathen
to
share
in
their
festivities
they
abandoned
themselves
to
drunkenness
and
profligacy
the
horror
and
indignation
of
the
severe
puritans
of
new
plymouth
at
this
outbreak
of
licentiousness
was
great
indeed
in
their
eyes
almost
every
amusement
was
looked
upon
as
a
sin
and
the
most
innocent
village
dance
round
a
maypole
was
regarded
as
nearly
allied
to
the
heathenish
games
in
honor
of
the
goddess
flora
the
conduct
therefore
of
the
disorderly
settlers
of
quincy
filled
them
with
shame
and
grief
and
they
felt
humbled
as
well
as
indignant
when
they
reflected
on
the
discredit
which
such
proceedings
must
necessarily
bring
on
the
christian
profession
and
the
british
name
nor
was
this
all
it
was
not
merely
discredit
that
they
had
to
fear
the
insane
and
profligate
conduct
of
morton
threatened
to
bring
on
them
eventually
as
well
as
on
all
the
emigrants
evils
of
a
more
personal
kind
for
when
morton
and
his
wild
associates
found
their
means
of
again
running
short
they
had
the
folly
to
part
with
arms
and
ammunition
to
the
indians
and
to
teach
them
how
to
use
them
thus
giving
them
the
power
of
not
only
resisting
the
authority
of
the
english
but
also
of
effectually
attacking
them
whenever
any
subjects
of
dispute
should
arise
between
them
and
the
invaders
most
joyfully
the
natives
took
advantage
of
this
impolitic
weakness
and
so
eagerly
did
they
purchase
the
coveted
firearms
of
their
rivals
that
morton
sent
to
england
for
a
fresh
supply
of
the
dangerous
merchandise
such
conduct
was
quite
sufficient
to
arouse
the
fears
and
the
vigilance
of
every
other
colony
of
new
england
and
the
chief
inhabitants
of
the
various
plantations
agreed
to
request
the
interference
of
their
brethren
of
new
plymouth
as
being
the
oldest
and
most
powerful
settlement
in
order
to
bring
the
offenders
to
their
senses
bradford
willingly
listened
to
their
petition
for
he
desired
nothing
more
earnestly
than
to
have
an
opportunity
of
openly
manifesting
to
his
countrymen
and
to
the
indians
how
greatly
opposed
he
and
his
people
were
to
the
proceedings
of
morton
gang
he
had
also
a
very
sufficient
pretext
for
such
interference
as
he
could
bring
forward
the
positive
command
of
his
sovereign
that
no
arms
of
any
kind
should
be
given
or
sold
to
the
natives
he
resolved
however
before
he
had
recourse
to
harsher
measures
to
try
and
bring
morton
and
his
wild
crew
to
a
better
mode
of
life
by
friendly
and
persuasive
messages
but
these
only
excited
the
contempt
and
derision
of
the
ruffian
and
the
doughty
warrior
miles
standish
was
therefore
dispatched
with
a
band
of
his
veteran
followers
to
seize
on
the
desperadoes
they
came
upon
them
when
they
were
in
the
midst
of
their
drunken
revelry
and
after
a
fierce
struggle
succeeded
in
making
them
all
prisoners
and
conveying
them
safely
to
plymouth
from
thence
morton
was
sent
by
the
first
opportunity
to
england
to
be
tried
by
the
high
council
who
however
did
not
take
any
active
measures
against
him
or
his
followers
many
of
the
latter
escaped
and
continued
their
disorderly
life
until
they
were
checked
by
the
vigorous
proceedings
of
endicott
who
severely
reprimanded
them
and
cut
down
the
which
had
given
rise
to
so
much
offence
and
he
named
the
hill
on
which
the
notorious
plantation
was
situated
dagon
in
memory
of
the
profane
doings
of
its
inhabitants
the
coast
of
massachusetts
bay
was
now
studded
with
plantations
and
with
rising
towns
and
villages
the
stream
of
emigration
continued
to
increase
and
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
the
colonies
in
general
kept
pace
with
the
addition
to
their
numbers
and
with
their
extended
trade
with
foreign
colonies
and
with
the
boston
had
become
a
place
of
some
note
and
seemed
to
be
regarded
as
the
seat
of
commerce
for
the
massachusetts
district
as
well
as
the
center
of
the
civil
government
most
of
the
families
of
the
neighboring
plantations
especially
of
charlestown
removed
to
boston
and
ere
long
it
was
deemed
expedient
to
found
a
regular
church
there
and
the
building
of
a
house
of
god
was
commenced
winthrop
the
governor
also
exerted
himself
in
the
erection
of
a
fortress
to
repel
the
dreaded
attacks
of
the
indians
but
he
soon
perceived
that
this
was
a
needless
precaution
for
all
the
neighboring
tribes
readily
offered
their
friendship
and
even
their
submission
and
as
the
strength
of
the
colony
daily
increased
he
found
that
he
had
less
and
less
to
fear
from
the
indians
the
sagamore
of
sawgus
in
the
vicinity
of
boston
remained
the
steady
friend
of
the
english
until
his
death
and
chickatabot
sachem
of
neponset
one
of
the
neighboring
chiefs
of
the
massachusetts
frequently
visited
the
rising
town
of
boston
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
excited
the
mirth
of
the
governor
and
his
suite
by
requesting
to
be
allowed
to
purchase
his
coat
to
which
he
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
this
strange
and
original
request
the
governor
courteously
replied
that
it
was
not
the
custom
of
the
english
sagamores
to
dispose
of
their
raiment
in
that
manner
but
he
consoled
the
disappointed
chieftain
by
sending
for
his
tailor
and
ordering
him
to
measure
chickatabot
for
a
full
suit
this
treasure
the
sachem
carried
away
with
him
three
days
afterwards
to
astonish
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
in
his
native
wilds
and
his
loyalty
towards
the
english
was
greatly
strengthened
by
so
handsome
and
judicious
a
present
cundincus
also
the
chief
of
the
powerful
and
much
dreaded
narragansetts
sent
his
son
with
a
friendly
greeting
to
the
new
settlers
of
boston
and
in
the
following
year
his
nephew
and
miantonomo
came
on
a
visit
to
the
governor
he
was
for
some
days
an
inmate
of
winthrop
house
and
it
is
recorded
that
he
not
only
conducted
himself
with
the
greatest
decorum
but
that
be
also
sat
patiently
to
listen
to
a
sermon
of
an
hour
and
a
half
duration
of
which
of
course
he
scarcely
comprehended
one
word
governor
winthrop
followed
the
good
example
that
had
already
been
set
by
both
carver
and
bradford
at
new
plymouth
in
regard
to
all
dealings
with
the
natives
he
always
maintained
their
rights
with
the
most
strict
and
impartial
justice
and
if
any
englishman
committed
an
injury
against
the
property
of
an
indian
he
compelled
him
to
replace
it
in
some
cases
even
to
twice
the
value
of
the
article
in
question
the
new
settlers
had
always
been
on
very
friendly
terms
with
the
elder
colony
of
plymouth
and
visits
were
frequently
exchanged
between
the
governors
and
others
of
the
inhabitants
which
though
performed
with
much
difficulty
and
even
danger
were
a
source
of
mutual
pleasure
to
the
two
bands
of
british
emigrants
if
the
men
of
plymouth
regarded
with
some
feeling
of
jealous
anxiety
the
growing
power
and
greatness
of
their
rival
it
was
but
natural
nevertheless
no
differences
of
any
importance
arose
between
the
colonies
on
the
subject
of
civil
superiority
it
was
on
spiritual
matters
that
they
sometimes
disagreed
and
on
these
points
the
plymouthers
watched
the
newcomers
with
suspicious
sensitiveness
and
resolved
to
maintain
their
purchased
based
rights
to
religious
freedom
against
any
pretensions
that
might
be
made
by
the
church
of
boston
this
latter
community
was
frequently
subject
to
divisions
and
disputes
on
those
points
of
faith
and
discipline
that
each
party
regarded
as
but
on
the
carrying
out
of
which
they
could
not
agree
and
a
certain
spirit
of
intolerance
had
already
begun
to
show
itself
among
them
which
in
later
times
ripened
into
actual
cruelty
and
persecution
the
first
instance
of
any
display
of
this
unchristian
spirit
with
which
our
narrative
is
concerned
was
the
treatment
of
a
young
clergyman
named
roger
williams
who
came
over
to
new
england
several
years
after
the
emigration
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
when
the
renewed
oppression
of
the
puritan
ministers
by
the
english
bishops
drove
many
of
their
number
to
seek
a
refuge
in
america
in
the
same
year
also
arrived
john
elliott
a
man
whose
name
is
deservedly
remembered
and
respected
in
new
england
as
standing
conspicuous
for
zeal
and
virtue
so
great
and
so
successful
were
his
labors
among
the
native
heathen
and
so
eminent
were
his
piety
and
his
charity
that
he
has
been
well
named
the
of
and
great
apostle
of
the
indians
the
arrival
of
these
holy
and
zealous
though
somewhat
eccentric
men
and
of
several
others
equally
resolved
to
maintain
the
freedom
of
their
religious
views
and
practices
tended
greatly
to
strengthen
and
establish
the
emigrants
and
also
added
considerably
to
their
comfort
as
every
settlement
became
provided
with
regular
and
authorized
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
could
enjoy
all
those
religious
privileges
from
which
they
had
been
so
long
debarred
but
it
must
also
be
confessed
that
it
became
the
source
of
much
dissension
and
party
feeling
and
led
to
that
display
of
bigotry
and
intolerance
that
eventually
disgraced
the
christian
profession
of
the
men
of

footnote
the
cruel
fate
of
mary
dyer
the
quaker
who
was
condemned
to
death
by
governor
endicott
at
boston
is
a
lamentable
instance
of
the
and
cruel
policy
of
the
rulers
of
that
community
she
was
banished
from
the
state
but
a
call
to
return
and
rebuke
the
austerity
of
the
men
of
boston
and
reprove
them
for
their
spiritual
pride
she
was
accompanied
by
two
friends
william
robinson
and
marmaduke
stevenson
and
all
three
were
seized
imprisoned
and
after
a
summary
trial
were
sent
to
the
gallows
the
two
men
were
executed
but
at
the
moment
when
mary
dyer
was
standing
calm
and
resigned
with
the
rope
around
her
neck
expecting
to
be
launched
into
eternity
a
reprieve
arrived
and
the
victim
was
released
but
it
was
only
for
a
little
time
she
was
again
banished
and
again
returned
as
if
to
seek
her
fate
a
second
trial
took
place
and
she
was
again
condemned
her
husband
who
knew
not
of
her
return
to
boston
until
it
was
too
late
appeared
before
the
magistrates
and
pleaded
with
all
the
eloquence
of
affection
and
anguish
but
he
wept
and
prayed
in
vain
his
young
and
lovely
wife
was
led
to
the
scaffold
where
she
met
her
fate
with
a
pious
and
even
cheerful
resignation
but
her
blood
has
left
a
dark
stain
on
the
history
of
the
church
of
boston
that
no
time
will
ever
efface
this
dreadful
event
occurred
about
forty
years
after
that
period
of
which
we
are
now
treating
roger
williams
was
a
man
comparatively
unknown
in
his
own
country
but
he
was
destined
to
exercise
considerable
influence
in
the
land
of
his
adoption
by
his
peculiar
views
of
religious
freedom
which
went
far
beyond
those
of
the
generality
of
his
fellow
puritans
he
desired
to
extend
to
others
that
liberty
of
conscience
which
he
claimed
as
his
own
privilege
and
for
the
attainment
of
which
he
had
become
a
wanderer
and
an
exile
but
he
soon
found
that
many
of
his
countrymen
had
forgotten
in
america
the
principles
of
spiritual
freedom
for
which
they
had
so
nobly
contended
in
england
and
were
ready
to
employ
against
those
who
differed
from
them
the
same
weapons
that
had
already
driven
them
from
their
his
sufferings
were
indeed
light
in
comparison
of
those
which
were
afterwards
inflicted
on
the
miserable
quakers
by
the
government
of
massachusetts
but
still
they
were
hard
for
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
and
galling
to
a
free
spirit
to
receive
from
those
who
boasted
of
their
own
love
of
freedom
roger
williams
was
not
more
than
years
of
age
when
he
arrived
in
new
england
he
had
boldly
separated
himself
from
all
communion
with
the
high
church
of
his
native
country
and
before
he
would
attach
himself
to
the
church
of
boston
he
demanded
from
its
members
a
similar
declaration
of
independence
the
fathers
of
the
colony
were
however
by
no
means
prepared
to
take
so
decided
a
step
which
would
lay
them
open
to
the
attacks
of
the
english
hierarchy
and
although
a
few
years
afterwards
when
they
could
do
it
with
less
risk
of
punishment
they
abjured
all
connection
with
the
church
of
england
yet
they
dared
not
at
present
give
any
countenance
to
such
individual
boldness
as
that
which
williams
had
manifested
his
uncompromising
principles
were
however
in
unison
with
those
of
the
church
of
salem
and
he
was
invited
by
that
community
to
be
their
teacher
as
an
assistant
to
their
pastor
skelton
whose
health
was
then
declining
the
rulers
of
boston
were
extremely
indignant
at
this
act
of
independence
on
the
part
of
the
salemers
and
they
addressed
to
them
a
remonstrance
desiring
them
to
take
no
such
steps
without
the
concurrence
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
but
the
men
of
salem
did
not
withdraw
their
invitation
which
was
accepted
by
roger
williams
and
in
a
short
time
his
piety
his
eloquence
and
the
kind
courtesy
of
his
manners
gained
for
him
the
esteem
and
affection
of
the
whole
community
he
was
not
however
permitted
to
remain
in
peace
in
his
new
home
the
suspicion
and
of
the
boston
government
followed
him
to
salem
and
so
greatly
embittered
his
life
and
interrupted
his
labors
that
he
found
it
expedient
to
withdraw
to
plymouth
where
he
found
employment
as
assistant
to
the
regular
pastor
ralph
smith
his
preaching
caused
great
excitement
in
new
plymouth
from
the
fervor
of
his
eloquence
and
the
freedom
of
his
opinions
which
aroused
the
sympathy
of
many
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
governor
bradford
was
much
interested
by
the
young
and
enthusiastic
minister
and
he
described
him
in
his
journal
as
man
full
of
the
fear
of
god
and
of
zeal
but
very
unsettled
in
judgement
certainly
his
opinions
were
peculiar
and
his
spirit
bold
and
defying
to
a
degree
that
rather
shocked
and
astonished
the
sober
severe
and
exclusive
men
of
plymouth
but
his
sincere
piety
caused
him
to
be
respected
even
by
those
who
shrank
from
going
such
lengths
as
he
did
and
his
engaging
manners
won
the
affection
of
all
who
were
admitted
to
his
intimacy
one
cause
of
the
anger
of
the
rulers
of
boston
against
this
energetic
young
man
was
an
essay
which
he
wrote
and
addressed
to
the
governor
of
plymouth
in
which
he
stated
his
conviction
that
king
of
england
had
no
right
whatever
to
give
away
these
lands
on
which
they
had
settled
but
that
they
belonged
exclusively
to
the
natives
and
must
be
bought
in
by
auction
from
them
no
one
who
entertains
a
sense
of
justice
will
now
be
disposed
to
object
to
this
opinion
but
it
gave
great
offence
to
the
government
of
boston
and
he
was
summoned
before
the
general
court
to
answer
to
governor
winthrop
for
having
promulgated
such
notions
he
did
not
however
attempt
to
defend
them
but
declared
that
they
were
privately
addressed
to
bradford
who
with
tin
chief
men
of
plymouth
agreed
with
him
in
all
the
material
points
of
his
essay
and
he
offend
to
burn
it
if
it
had
given
offence
at
boston
the
subject
was
then
dropped
and
williams
returned
to
plymouth
where
he
continued
to
reside
for
a
considerable
time
during
that
period
he
not
only
gained
many
friends
among
the
inhabitants
but
he
also
by
a
constant
intercourse
with
the
wampanoges
and
other
neighboring
tribes
obtained
a
considerable
knowledge
of
their
language
and
manners
and
secured
their
veneration
and
love
this
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
proved
afterwards
of
the
greatest
advantage
to
him
but
his
own
restless
spirit
was
not
satisfied
with
quietly
discharging
the
duties
of
his
office
and
enjoying
the
society
of
his
own
countrymen
and
their
indian
allies
again
he
drew
upon
himself
the
wrath
of
the
boston
church
by
openly
stating
his
conviction
that
no
civil
government
had
a
right
to
punish
any
individual
for
a
breach
of
the
sabbath
or
for
any
offence
against
either
of
the
four
commandments
or
the
first
table
he
maintained
that
these
points
should
be
left
to
the
conscience
alone
or
in
the
case
of
those
who
had
agreed
to
a
church
covenant
to
the
authorities
of
the
church
the
civil
magistrates
he
considered
as
only
empowered
to
punish
such
violations
of
the
law
as
interfered
with
the
public
peace
this
heresy
against
the
principles
by
which
the
bostoners
were
governed
was
received
with
amazement
and
indignation
and
although
they
could
not
take
any
immediate
measures
to
testify
their
displeasure
and
to
punish
the
offender
yet
he
thenceforth
became
the
object
of
hatred
and
suspicion
to
the
rulers
and
they
only
waited
for
a
fitting
opportunity
of
openly
manifesting
it
williams
was
aware
of
the
feeling
entertained
towards
him
by
the
government
of
massachusetts
but
he
was
not
thereby
deterred
from
expressing
his
opinions
in
new
plymouth
and
so
great
was
his
attachment
to
the
people
of
salem
who
had
first
afforded
him
a
home
that
he
would
again
have
ventured
thither
had
he
not
been
detained
by
his
new
friends
they
were
both
numerous
and
sincere
and
among
them
none
were
more
attached
to
him
than
the
maitland
family
who
agreed
with
him
in
most
of
his
religious
and
political
opinions
and
valued
his
society
on
account
of
his
unaffected
piety
and
the
various
powers
and
accomplishments
of
his
mind
possibly
it
was
the
attraction
that
roger
williams
found
in
this
family
that
caused
him
so
long
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
repeated
solicitations
of
his
old
friends
at
salem
that
he
would
again
take
up
his
abode
among
them
certainly
it
was
not
fear
of
the
rulers
of
boston
that
kept
his
undaunted
spirit
in
a
district
over
which
they
had
no
authority
neither
was
it
altogether
the
harmony
that
subsisted
between
his
views
and
those
of
the
hospitable
plymouthers
on
many
points
they
agreed
but
not
on
all
and
those
who
differed
from
him
feared
that
his
continued
residence
among
them
might
excite
a
party
spirit
and
mar
that
peace
which
had
hitherto
reigned
in
their
community
still
roger
williams
did
continue
to
dwell
at
new
plymouth
and
still
his
visits
to
the
house
of
maitland
became
more
and
more
frequent

liberties
are

with
the
private
life
of
this
interesting
character
in

to

more
closely

the
events
of

narrative

the
incidents

period
when
roger
williams
was
induced
to
seek
a
home
among
the
pilgrim
fathers
of
new
plymouth
edith
maitland
had
attained
to
womanhood
she
was
not
beautiful
strictly
speaking
but
she
was
possessed
of
that
than
beauty
dearer
that
nameless
and
indescribable
charm
that
is
sometimes
seen
to
surround
a
person
whose
form
and
features
would
not
satisfy
the
critical
eye
of
an
artist
it
was
edith
character
which
looked
out
from
her
clear
hazel
eye
and
won
the
interest
and
the
affection
of
all
who
knew
her
gentle
and
affectionate
in
disposition
but
at
the
same
time
firm
enduring
and
fall
of
energy
she
combined
the
characteristic
qualities
of
both
her
parents
and
added
to
them
an
originality
all
her
own
her
education
in
the
common
acceptation
of
the
term
had
necessarily
been
both
desultory
and
imperfect
and
yet
under
its
influence
the
mind
and
character
of
edith
had
strengthened
and
matured
in
no
common
degree
the
very
circumstances
by
which
she
was
surrounded
had
educated
her
and
sorrow
deep
abiding
sorrow
for
the
loss
of
both
her
brothers
had
taught
her
to
look
on
life
in
a
different
point
of
view
and
with
different
expectations
from
those
with
which
it
is
usually
regarded
by
the
young
her
mother
had
watched
her
opening
mind
and
disposition
with
much
care
and
anxiety
but
she
had
not
sought
to
check
its
interesting
peculiarity
or
to
control
the
wild
exuberance
of
thought
and
feeling
that
were
occasionally
manifested
by
her
intelligent
and
engaging
child
as
she
grew
older
she
became
more
and
more
the
companion
of
helen
who
studied
her
character
attentively
and
if
we
be
allowed
such
a
figure
of
speech
wisely
endeavored
to
train
it
in
a
right
direction
rather
than
to
prune
it
to
any
conventional
form
thus
a
perfect
confidence
was
established
and
ever
subsisted
between
the
mother
and
daughter
and
the
natural
thoughtfulness
of
spirit
and
energy
of
purpose
that
belonged
to
edith
were
unchecked
and
she
was
allowed
to
possess
an
individuality
of
character
that
is
unhappily
too
often
repressed
and
destroyed
in
these
present
days
of
high
civilization
and
uniformity
of
education
the
courteous
manners
which
both
helen
and
her
husband
had
acquired
in
early
life
when
they
dwelt
in
comparative
affluence
in
england
were
inherited
by
their
daughter
in
full
measure
and
her
whole
manner
and
conduct
were
marked
by
a
refinement
and
elegance
that
seemed
little
in
keeping
with
the
life
of
extreme
simplicity
and
even
of
hardship
that
she
had
experienced
from
her
early
childhood
while
her
brothers
were
spared
to
her
she
was
their
constant
companion
and
playfellow
and
except
when
her
mother
required
her
attendance
either
as
her
pupil
or
her
assistant
in
domestic
occupations
she
spent
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
in
rambling
with
them
on
the
or
through
the
adjacent
woods
or
else
in
the
active
and
tasteful
cultivation
of
their
garden
and
when
successive
calamities
deprived
her
of
these
cherished
objects
of
her
early
affection
she
still
continued
to
wander
to
the
spots
where
they
had
played
and
conversed
together
under
the
guardianship
of
the
faithful
fingal
and
with
no
companion
but
the
powerful
and
sagacious
animal
she
was
even
permitted
to
ramble
through
the
woods
as
far
as
the
wampanoge
village
and
divert
her
sorrowful
thoughts
in
the
society
of
apannow
and
her
lively
little
son
nepea
but
after
the
sad
day
when
edith
wept
on
the
lifeless
body
of
her
favorite
fingal
and
saw
him
laid
in
the
grave
that
was
dug
for
him
beneath
the
great
she
seemed
to
concentrate
her
affections
on
the
bower
that
henrich
had
erected
and
the
plants
that
he
and
ludovico
had
transplanted
from
the
forest
to
cover
its
trellised
walls
and
to
decorate
the
garden
that
surrounded
it
many
of
these
were
again
removed
and
planted
on
fingal
grave
and
there
on
a
seat
that
her
brother
had
edith
sit
hour
after
hour
either
buried
in
contemplations
of
the
past
and
the
future
or
else
devouring
with
avidity
the
few
books
that
her
parents
possessed
or
that
she
could
procure
from
their
friends
and
neighbors
she
formed
no
intimacy
with
any
of
her
own
young
countrywomen
they
were
too
unlike
herself
they
had
generally
known
no
sorrow
or
if
it
had
fallen
on
them
its
strokes
had
not
made
a
like
impression
on
their
characters
and
edith
could
find
no
consolation
or
pleasure
in
their
society
so
she
lived
alone
with
her
own
spirit
and
indulged
her
own
high
aspirations
and
none
but
helen
was
the
confidant
of
any
of
her
thoughts
and
imaginings
many
of
them
she
kept
within
her
own
breast
for
she
felt
that
it
would
distress
her
mother
to
know
how
little
charm
remained
to
her
in
life
and
how
often
she
looked
up
into
the
blue
depths
of
heaven
and
wished
that
she
had
wings
of
a
dove
and
could
flee
away
from
this
cold
world
be
at
rest
where
henrich
and
ludovico
dwelt
and
yet
edith
was
not
unhappy
as
she
grew
up
and
became
a
more
equal
and
rational
companion
to
her
parents
the
cares
and
business
of
life
necessarily
occupied
more
of
her
time
and
thoughts
and
gave
her
less
leisure
for
solitary
meditation
and
her
daily
increasing
sense
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
a
christian
led
her
to
regard
as
selfishness
that
indulgence
of
her
own
thoughts
and
feelings
in
which
she
had
so
much
delighted
she
was
therefore
cheerful
and
even
gay
at
home
but
she
desired
no
pleasures
beyond
those
that
her
home
afforded
and
that
were
perfectly
consistent
with
the
self
denying
views
and
principles
of
her
puritan
in
all
the
doctrines
of
her
sect
edith
was
thoroughly
and
to
all
those
that
were
really
scriptural
she
gave
a
sincere
and
assent
but
the
stern
severity
of
puritan
principles
and
puritan
bigotry
found
no
response
in
her
gentle
nature
and
the
minded
intolerance
of
the
boston
church
aroused
both
her
contempt
and
indignation
she
was
therefore
quite
prepared
to
regard
with
interest
and
favor
the
young
minister
who
had
made
himself
obnoxious
to
their
laws
end
customs
and
had
sought
a
refuge
among
the
more
liberal
and
kindly
pilgrims
of
new
plymouth
the
acquaintance
of
roger
williams
was
soon
made
by
the
maitlands
and
once
begun
it
quickly
ripened
into
intimacy
and
friendship
in
rodolph
he
found
a
sound
and
able
adviser
in
helen
a
kind
friend
and
a
companion
but
in
edith
he
found
a
kindred
spirit
to
his
own
one
who
could
understand
and
sympathize
in
his
yearnings
for
freedom
of
thought
and
action
and
in
his
strong
sense
of
the
injustice
of
his
oppressors
in
all
their
tastes
and
pursuits
they
were
likewise
as
well
agreed
as
in
their
religious
and
social
opinions
edith
passionate
love
of
natural
beauty
was
fully
shared
by
the
young
refugee
and
many
an
hour
passed
swiftly
away
while
he
instructed
his
quick
and
willing
scholar
in
the
mysteries
of
sketching
in
which
pleasant
art
he
was
himself
a
proficient
edith
loved
music
also
and
frequently
accompanied
her
own
rich
voice
with
the
simple
notes
of
the
mandolin
while
she
sang
the
old
songs
of
her
fatherland
hitherto
her
mother
had
been
her
only
instructor
in
this
most
refined
and
refining
of
all
human
pleasures
but
now
she
found
an
able
and
very
ready
teacher
in
roger
williams
and
it
was
a
matter
of
astonishment
to
her
father
when
he
observed
the
rapid
progress
she
made
both
in
the
science
and
the
practice
of
music
from
the
time
the
interesting
stranger
undertook
to
give
her
lessons
his
deep
manly
voice
harmonized
perfectly
with
her
sweet
tones
and
they
often
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
helen
and
called
forth
a
sigh
from
the
breast
of
rodolph
as
they
sang
together
some
ancient
english
ballad
or
united
their
voices
in
the
chants
and
anthems
that
were
dear
to
the
hearts
of
the
exiles
and
recalled
days
of
youth
and
happiness
long
passed
away
and
never
to
return
edith
bower
was
the
usual
scene
of
these
domestic
concerts
and
there
the
long
sweet
summer
evenings
glided
away
in
happiness
that
the
of
that
bower
as
henrich
had
named
her
had
never
known
since
the
last
evening
that
she
spent
there
with
her
brother
she
began
to
wonder
why
she
had
hitherto
associated
none
but
melancholy
ideas
with
the
lovely
spot
and
to
find
that
it
was
possible
to
feel
even
gay
and
while
surrounded
by
henrich
flowers
and
looking
on
fingal
grave
how
strange
it
seemed
and
yet
how
pleasant
a
new
existence
seemed
opening
before
edith
soul
and
life
no
longer
appeared
a
dreary
pilgrimage
which
duty
alone
could
render
interesting
the
powers
of
her
mind
also
received
a
fresh
impulse
from
the
society
of
the
cultivated
englishman
and
was
drawn
out
in
a
manner
as
agreeable
as
it
was
new
roger
had
brought
from
his
native
land
a
collection
of
books
which
though
small
in
number
seemed
to
edith
a
perfect
library
and
all
were
offered
for
her
perusal
several
of
them
were
of
course
on
controversial
and
doctrinal
subjects
and
these
she
was
able
to
understand
and
to
appreciate
but
among
these
graver
and
more
abstruse
treatises
were
some
of
a
more
attractive
nature
some
volumes
of
foreign
travel
and
ancient
legends
and
poetry
in
which
the
soul
of
edith
reveled
as
in
a
garden
of
new
and
fragrant
flowers
it
was
a
fresh
and
a
very
rich
enjoyment
to
one
who
had
known
so
few
literary
pleasures
to
pore
over
these
volumes
and
find
her
own
vivid
thoughts
and
wild
imaginings
set
before
her
in
all
the
captivating
colors
of
poetry
and
fiction
or
to
follow
the
wanderings
of
travelers
through
the
civilized
and
enlightened
countries
of
the
old
continent
and
learn
from
books
those
manners
and
customs
of
refined
life
which
in
all
human
probability
it
would
never
be
her
lot
to
witness
but
this
enjoyment
was
more
than
doubled
when
roger
took
the
book
and
as
he
often
did
read
to
her
and
her
mother
while
they
sat
at
their
work
in
edith
bower
in
the
heat
of
the
day
and
if
the
younger
listener
did
occasionally
pause
in
her
occupation
and
forget
to
ply
her
needle
while
she
looked
up
at
the
fine
expressive
countenance
of
the
reader
she
may
be
pardoned
for
the
voice
and
the
expression
were
in
such
perfect
unison
that
the
one
added
greatly
to
the
effect
of
the
other
perhaps
these
days
of
peaceful
intercourse
and
growing
but
unacknowledged
affection
were
among
the
happiest
of
edith
checkered
life
certain
it
is
that
in
after
days
of
trial
and
difficulty
she
looked
back
upon
them
as
on
some
green
and
sunny
spot
in
the
varied
field
of
memory
but
they
could
not
last
for
ever
days
and
weeks
passed
by
and
edith
was
too
happy
in
the
present
to
occupy
herself
much
about
the
future
but
her
parents
thought
of
it
for
her
and
roger
thought
of
it
for
her
and
for
himself
her
graceful
manners
and
appearance
had
attracted
him
on
his
first
acquaintance
with
her
and
the
favorable
impression
had
been
strengthened
from
day
to
day
as
he
acquired
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
her
thoughtful
character
and
amiable
temper
and
it
was
not
long
ere
he
felt
that
his
future
happiness
in
life
depended
on
her
returning
those
sentiments
with
which
she
had
inspired
him
had
he
been
possessed
of
much
vanity
he
would
not
long
have
entertained
any
doubt
on
this
interesting
point
for
edith
was
too
open
and
ingenuous
and
too
little
in
the
habit
of
disguising
her
feelings
to
pretend
an
indifference
that
her
heart
soon
denied
but
the
very
admiration
and
respect
with
which
she
inspired
roger
prevented
him
from
the
flattering
unction
to
his
soul
and
caused
him
for
some
time
to
suppose
that
the
very
evident
pleasure
she
felt
in
his
society
arose
from
the
solitary
life
she
had
hitherto
led
and
the
natural
enjoyment
of
an
intelligent
mind
in
conversing
with
one
who
could
enter
into
her
feelings
and
tastes
and
impart
some
fresh
ideas
to
give
food
to
her
thoughts
and
imagination
helen
however
was
not
under
this
misconception
with
regard
to
her
daughter
feelings
and
she
felt
much
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
her
acquaintance
with
the
young
clergyman
the
remarkable
transparency
of
edith
character
rendered
it
easy
for
a
parent
eye
to
discover
the
deep
impression
that
roger
fascinating
manners
and
rare
accomplishments
had
made
both
on
her
fancy
and
her
heart
and
it
was
equally
easy
to
perceive
that
his
affections
were
entirely
gained
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
draw
back
in
this
or
any
other
pursuit
in
which
his
feelings
were
deeply
engaged
there
was
a
simple
earnestness
of
manner
in
every
thing
that
he
said
or
did
that
irresistibly
won
both
confidence
and
love
and
helen
and
her
husband
entertained
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
his
attachment
to
their
child
or
of
his
full
intention
to
offer
his
hand
to
her
as
soon
as
he
could
feel
any
certainty
of
its
being
accepted
neither
did
they
doubt
his
power
to
make
her
happy
for
it
was
evident
that
their
tastes
and
dispositions
were
admirably
suited
and
their
characters
marked
to
a
great
degree
by
the
same
peculiarities
but
it
was
these
very
peculiarities
in
which
they
so
well
agreed
and
which
each
would
probably
strengthen
and
confirm
in
the
other
that
gave
rise
to
the
anxious
thoughts
that
dwelt
in
helen
mind
and
which
she
communicated
to
rudolph
roger
williams
was
already
a
marked
man
and
an
object
of
suspicion
and
displeasure
to
the
rising
power
of
boston
already
he
had
been
compelled
to
retire
before
the
persecuting
spirit
of
the
boston
church
and
to
seek
shelter
in
the
rival
and
more
charitable
colony
where
his
peculiar
opinions
were
tolerated
even
if
they
were
not
approved
but
the
maitlands
knew
that
his
position
at
new
plymouth
did
not
satisfy
the
yearnings
of
his
earnest
and
aspiring
soul
and
that
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
return
to
salem
and
minister
among
those
who
had
been
his
first
friends
and
his
first
congregation
his
reason
for
so
bag
delaying
this
measure
was
very
evident
and
edith
parents
justly
feared
that
as
soon
as
the
object
which
now
engrossed
his
whole
mind
was
attained
and
he
had
won
their
daughter
heart
and
band
be
would
take
her
from
her
present
safe
and
peaceful
home
to
share
with
him
the
trials
and
difficulties
and
even
dangers
which
might
await
him
on
his
return
to
the
state
of
massachusetts
where
they
felt
sure
he
would
again
proclaim
the
opinions
that
had
already
given
so
much
offence
this
was
a
reasonable
cause
for
anxiety
but
it
was
not
a
sufficient
ground
on
which
to
refuse
a
connection
with
such
a
man
as
roger
williams
a
man
who
might
indeed
by
his
daring
freedom
of
spirit
and
uncompromising
opinions
bring
earthly
trial
on
himself
and
any
one
whose
fate
was
united
to
his
but
whose
lofty
piety
and
steadfast
faith
must
carry
with
them
a
spiritual
blessing
and
gild
and
cheer
the
path
however
dark
and
thorny
in
which
he
and
his
partner
should
be
called
to
tread
it
was
therefore
with
mingled
feelings
of
pain
and
pleasure
that
helen
heard
from
edith
that
roger
had
at
length
taken
courage
to
declare
to
her
his
own
feelings
and
to
ask
whether
she
could
return
them
her
glowing
cheek
and
glistening
eye
as
she
revealed
the
interesting
fact
would
have
left
her
mother
in
no
doubt
as
to
the
answer
she
had
returned
even
if
she
had
not
already
guessed
her
sentiments
and
she
and
rodolph
could
but
give
their
consent
to
her
wishes
and
ask
a
blessing
on
her
choice
the
joy
and
gratitude
of
roger
knew
no
bounds
now
he
felt
that
life
lay
all
bright
and
clear
before
him
and
that
no
outward
trials
could
have
power
to
cloud
his
path
so
long
as
edith
walked
by
his
side
to
divide
his
sorrows
and
double
his
joys
he
employed
all
his
eloquence
to
persuade
rodolph
and
helen
to
consent
to
his
speedy
marriage
for
now
that
his
object
in
lingering
at
plymouth
was
attained
all
his
love
for
his
flock
at
salem
and
his
desire
once
more
to
dwell
among
them
returned
with
added
force
he
was
impatient
to
resume
his
spiritual
duties
where
first
he
had
commenced
them
in
new
england
and
he
was
eager
also
to
present
edith
as
his
bride
to
the
friends
who
had
once
so
kindly
received
him
and
who
now
so
pressingly
invited
him
to
return
the
aspect
of
affairs
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
was
then
peaceable
and
no
demonstration
of
enmity
towards
roger
had
lately
been
made
by
the
boston
rulers
so
that
rodolph
and
helen
had
no
pretext
for
delaying
their
daughter
marriage
and
her
removal
to
salem
with
her
husband
the
letter
of
invitation
to
roger
williams
from
that
community
also
contained
such
alarming
accounts
of
the
rapidly
declining
health
of
their
pastor
skelton
that
the
necessity
for
the
presence
of
his
intended
successor
could
not
be
denied
with
some
reluctance
the
maitlands
therefore
agreed
to
an
early
day
for
the
performance
of
the
simple
ceremony
that
would
unite
their
beloved
and
only
remaining
child
to
one
whom
they
loved
and
respected
but
whose
fiery
zeal
inspired
them
with
doubt
and
anxiety
no
sooner
was
the
happy
day
fixed
than
roger
hastened
to
dispatch
a
trusty
messenger
to
roxburgh
with
a
letter
to
his
valued
friend
and
brother
minister
elliot
who
was
appointed
preacher
in
that
town
to
entreat
him
to
be
present
at
his
marriage
and
to
honor
the
ceremony
by
giving
the
customary
address
at
its
conclusion
much
to
his
satisfaction
and
that
of
all
the
maitland
family
this
request
was
acceded
to
and
the
of
missionaries
arrived
at
new
plymouth
accompanied
also
by
his
bride
he
was
betrothed
when
he
left
england
but
circumstances
had
then
prevented
his
intended
wife
from
accompanying
him
but
as
soon
as
he
was
settled
at
roxburgh
she
followed
him
to
the
land
of
his
exile
and
became
his
faithful
and
devoted
companion
through
a
long
and
toilsome
life
and
his
able
and
efficient
helpmate
in
all
his
difficulties
the
chief
object
of
this
excellent
man
in
leaving
his
own
country
was
not
so
much
to
escape
the
persecution
that
then
awaited
the
ministers
of
his
sect
as
to
attempt
the
conversion
of
the
native
heathen
for
this
pious
and
disinterested
purpose
he
abandoned
home
and
kindred
and
all
that
was
dear
to
him
and
at
the
age
of
entered
that
land
of
distant
promise
to
the
evangelization
of
which
he
had
resolved
to
devote
all
the
powers
of
his
life
and
the
faculties
of
his
energetic
mind
so
abstemious
and
was
he
that
his
mode
of
life
resembled
that
of
a
hermit
and
at
the
same
time
so
liberal
was
he
in
relieving
the
wants
of
others
whether
his
own
countrymen
or
the
red
indians
that
if
his
wife
had
not
been
a
careful
and
clever
manager
they
must
often
have
been
reduced
to
absolute
want
there
is
an
anecdote
recorded
of
him
so
characteristic
of
the
spirit
of
the
apostle
of
the
indians
that
it
ought
not
to
be
omitted
here
where
we
are
endeavoring
to
give
a
faithful
picture
of
the
manners
and
the
principles
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
their
immediate
followers
the
society
in
england
under
whose
auspices
he
had
emigrated
allowed
him
a
salary
of
a
year
a
great
portion
of
which
as
well
as
of
his
small
private
resources
was
always
dedicated
to
charitable
purposes
it
was
his
custom
when
he
received
his
quarterly
payment
from
the
treasurer
of
the
colony
to
give
away
a
considerable
part
of
it
before
he
reached
his
home
so
that
elliot
as
she
was
called
only
received
a
very
small
sum
inadequate
to
the
necessary
expenses
of
her
frugal
housekeeping
the
paymaster
knew
the
good
man
peculiarities
and
was
aware
of
the
domestic
embarrassments
that
his
bounty
often
occasioned
he
therefore
tied
the
money
up
in
a
handkerchief
with
so
many
knots
that
he
was
sure
the
pastor
could
never
untie
them
and
gave
it
to
him
saying
in
jest
really
reverend
sir
you
must
this
time
give
it
all
to
your
worthy
elliot
smiled
and
departed
but
before
he
reached
his
dwelling
he
remembered
an
afflicted
family
who
stood
in
need
of
his
assistance
and
consolation
and
on
going
to
visit
them
he
found
them
overwhelmed
with
unexpected
distress
he
immediately
attempted
to
open
his
handkerchief
but
all
his
efforts
were
unavailing
to
loosen
the
complicated
knots
well
he
said
at
last
see
it
is
the
will
of
the
lord
that
you
should
have
the
and
giving
them
all
his
wealth
he
returned
home
penniless
dame
elliot
never
showed
any
displeasure
at
these
improvident
acts
of
her
husband
she
admired
and
respected
his
pious
motives
and
his
beautiful
spirit
of
and
she
only
strove
the
more
to
limit
her
expenses
and
to
make
their
home
cheerful
and
comfortable
with
the
scanty
means
she
possessed
while
she
willingly
conformed
to
the
life
of
extreme
simplicity
which
he
felt
it
right
to
adopt
more
than
one
dish
was
never
allowed
to
appear
on
his
table
and
water
was
his
only
beverage
if
wine
was
offered
him
at
the
house
of
a
friend
he
courteously
declined
but
never
blamed
in
others
the
indulgence
which
he
denied
to
himself
he
used
to
say
is
a
precious
noble
thing
and
we
should
thank
the
lord
for
it
but
to
suit
me
aright
water
should
rather
be
there
such
were
the
christian
pair
who
came
to
attend
the
wedding
of
edith
and
roger
and
to
offer
their
congratulations
on
the
event
and
their
prayers
that
it
might
tend
to
the
present
and
the
eternal
happiness
of
their
valued
friend
and
his
interesting
bride
it
could
not
be
otherwise
than
that
dame
elliot
and
edith
should
form
a
speedy
and
a
lasting
friendship
there
was
a
similarity
of
feeling
and
a
difference
of
character
that
rendered
them
peculiarly
agreeable
to
each
other
and
made
them
mutually
rejoice
in
the
prospect
of
future
intercourse
which
the
strong
regard
that
subsisted
between
elliot
and
williams
and
the
nearness
of
salem
to
roxburgh
promised
to
afford
them
the
young
matron
was
of
a
much
more
calm
and
subdued
temperament
than
her
new
friend
her
early
life
and
education
had
been
very
different
from
edith
and
the
man
on
whom
she
had
fixed
her
affections
and
the
mode
of
life
to
which
her
marriage
had
conducted
her
had
alike
tended
to
promote
a
quiet
composure
and
steady
regulation
of
mind
rather
than
to
arouse
the
enthusiastic
feelings
and
the
lively
fancies
that
distinguished
edith
character
and
which
had
proved
so
irresistible
a
charm
to
the
fervid
soul
of
williams
but
each
of
the
young
women
was
well
adapted
to
the
lot
which
providence
had
assigned
them
and
each
proved
a
blessing
and
a
support
through
life
to
their
respective
partners
but
little
preparation
was
required
for
the
puritan
nuptials
that
were
now
about
to
be
celebrated
and
little
gaiety
or
display
was
manifested
on
the
occasion
according
to
the
custom
of
the
sect
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
by
bradford
as
the
chief
civil
magistrate
and
the
personal
friend
of
the
family
at
that
period
marriage
was
regarded
as
a
mere
civil
act
and
either
the
magistrate
of
the
place
or
a
commissary
appointed
for
the
purpose
was
alone
required
by
law
to
officiate
if
a
clergyman
chanced
to
be
present
he
was
generally
requested
to
offer
up
a
prayer
or
even
to
deliver
a
suitable
discourse
to
the
parties
but
this
was
a
matter
of
choice
and
not
of
necessity
and
had
no
share
in
the
validity
of
the
ceremony
even
the
wedding
ring
had
already
begun
to
be
regarded
by
the
plymouthers
as
a
relic
of
popish
corruption
and
superstition
and
was
in
many
cases
dispensed
with
and
some
time
afterwards
formally
forbidden
but
on
this
occasion
it
was
retained
at
the
wish
of
both
edith
and
her
mother
who
were
accustomed
to
regard
it
as
a
beautiful
and
almost
a
sacred
symbol
of
the
purity
and
the
duration
of
the
holy
tie
of
marriage
on
the
appointed
day
the
civil
rite
was
duly
and
solemnly
performed
by
the
governor
in
the
presence
of
a
few
chosen
friends
among
whom
none
felt
more
interest
in
the
future
welfare
of
the
young
bride
than
the
venerable
william
brewster
although
he
was
not
a
regular
minister
he
was
invited
by
rodolph
and
helen
to
offer
up
a
prayer
for
the
temporal
and
eternal
happiness
of
their
beloved
child
and
fervently
and
eloquently
the
old
man
complied
with
their
request
and
tears
of
affection
and
anxiety
glistened
in
his
eyes
as
he
concluded
his
prayer
and
added
his
own
heartfelt
blessing
to
that
which
he
had
asked
from
heaven
elliot
then
delivered
a
powerful
and
impressive
address
to
the
young
married
couple
on
their
social
and
domestic
as
well
as
their
spiritual
duties
and
a
simple
but
repast
at
house
completed
the
ceremonies
of
the
day
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
marriage
of
henrich
and
oriana
was
celebrated
in
the
distant
wilderness
where
all
the
outward
circumstances
were
so
different
and
where
no
prescribed
forms
could
be
observed
to
render
the
simple
ceremony
legal
or
impressive
and
yet
surely
it
was
as
sacred
and
as
binding
to
those
who
then
plighted
their
faith
to
each
other
as
if
it
had
been
performed
with
all
the
rites
of
civilized
life
the
vows
of
henrich
and
his
christian
bride
were
made
in
the
presence
of
that
god
who
instituted
marriage
and
hollowed
it
and
they
were
sanctified
by
the
of
faith
which
rises
as
freely
and
as
acceptably
from
the
wilderness
as
from
the
stately
cathedral
had
edith
and
her
brother
known
that
their
earthly
fate
was
thus
being
decided
so
nearly
at
the
same
period
how
would
the
supplications
which
they
offered
for
themselves
have
been
mingled
with
prayers
for
the
happiness
of
one
another
a
brief
sojourn
in
her
home
was
allowed
to
edith
after
her
marriage
and
then
she
gladly
but
tearfully
left
her
parents
to
share
the
fortunes
of
him
who
would
be
more
to
her
than
father
or
mother
or
brother
or
sister
could
be
the
pinnace
that
belonged
to
the
colony
was
appointed
by
the
governor
to
convey
roger
and
his
bride
to
massachusetts
bay
and
land
them
as
near
as
possible
to
their
new
home
in
salem
and
thus
edith
was
spared
the
fatigue
and
difficulty
of
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
through
the
woods
and
the
wilderness
by
land
she
was
kindly
and
joyfully
welcomed
by
her
husband
friends
and
admirers
who
were
already
disposed
to
regard
her
with
favor
and
who
soon
learnt
both
to
love
and
respect
her
for
her
own
many
amiable
and
estimable
qualities
chapter
xx
was
a
woman
of
a
steadfast
mind
tender
and
deep
in
her
excess
of
love
the
life
of
peace
and
tranquillity
which
roger
and
his
young
bride
enjoyed
in
their
new
home
was
not
long
permitted
to
be
their
happy
lot
the
apprehensions
that
had
been
felt
by
edith
anxious
parents
were
but
too
soon
realized
and
notwithstanding
all
the
good
advice
that
he
received
at
plymouth
and
all
his
own
sincere
resolutions
to
avoid
if
possible
all
future
disputes
with
the
elders
or
the
boston
church
roger
williams
again
became
the
object
of
their
persecuting
intolerance
the
fact
of
his
being
again
invited
to
salem
to
assist
the
pastor
was
regarded
as
extremely
offensive
to
the
government
of
boston
but
when
shelton
died
very
shortly
after
roger
arrival
and
he
was
elected
to
be
the
regular
minister
of
the
congregation
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
sinful
defiance
of
lawful
authority
and
one
which
demanded
exemplary
punishment
an
opportunity
for
this
exercise
of
power
soon
occurred
the
township
of
salem
lain
claim
to
a
certain
disputed
piece
of
land
and
addressed
a
petition
to
the
government
of
massachusetts
in
which
they
demanded
to
be
put
in
possession
of
it
but
in
consequence
of
the
recent
act
of
the
community
with
regard
to
roger
williams
election
the
claim
was
unjustly
rejected
the
salemers
then
by
the
advice
of
their
pastor
wrote
to
all
the
other
churches
in
the
bay
and
requested
them
to
unite
in
a
remonstrance
to
the
government
this
act
was
in
perfect
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
puritanical
principles
which
distinctly
separated
the
church
from
the
state
and
it
ought
not
therefore
to
have
given
offence
to
any
one
but
their
practice
differed
greatly
from
their
theory
and
the
feeling
against
williams
was
so
strong
that
all
the
churches
the
elders
of
which
were
opposed
to
his
opinions
now
took
part
with
the
government
of
boston
against
him
this
treatment
so
irritated
the
warm
feelings
of
williams
and
so
keenly
wounded
his
sense
of
justice
and
love
of
liberty
that
he
required
the
church
of
salem
to
renounce
all
connection
with
the
other
congregations
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
refuse
all
intercourse
with
his
own
church
until
this
separation
was
agreed
to
but
strongly
as
the
salemers
were
attached
to
their
pastor
they
could
not
consent
to
so
decisive
a
measure
as
he
demanded
and
being
vexed
and
dispirited
by
the
general
disapprobation
which
their
conduct
had
excited
in
the
rest
of
the
colony
the
greatest
part
of
the
congregation
fell
away
from
him
this
desertion
grieved
the
heart
of
the
zealous
minister
but
it
did
not
discourage
him
or
subdue
his
determined
spirit
he
began
to
hold
spiritual
meetings
at
his
own
house
which
were
attended
by
those
members
of
the
church
who
fully
concurred
in
his
views
and
who
considered
that
he
had
been
treated
with
injustice
this
proceeding
naturally
aroused
a
strong
party
spirit
in
the
town
and
even
threatened
to
produce
a
permanent
division
in
the
church
as
the
followers
of
williams
held
themselves
entirely
aloof
from
the
rest
of
the
congregation
deeply
did
edith
lament
this
unhappy
state
of
affairs
her
devotion
to
her
husband
and
the
natural
tendency
of
her
own
mind
led
her
to
sympathize
entirely
in
his
opinions
and
feelings
and
her
strong
sense
of
right
and
wrong
caused
her
to
condemn
the
injustice
of
the
government
and
the
weak
truckling
spirit
of
the
but
her
judgement
was
more
calm
and
dispassionate
than
that
of
roger
and
her
temper
far
less
excitable
she
therefore
saw
the
impropriety
as
well
as
the
danger
of
causing
a
schism
in
the
church
and
she
used
all
her
powerful
influence
to
induce
her
husband
to
give
up
these
irregular
assemblies
and
without
compromising
his
own
opinions
to
endeavor
to
ward
off
the
enmity
of
the
men
of
boston
she
earnestly
besought
him
again
to
leave
the
congregation
of
salem
the
greater
portion
of
which
had
already
deserted
him
and
his
cause
and
to
return
to
plymouth
where
a
safe
and
a
happy
home
might
yet
be
afforded
to
them
and
where
no
persecution
for
conscience
sake
need
be
feared
but
all
her
arguments
and
her
persuasions
were
alike
ineffectual
on
this
one
point
she
found
her
roger
firm
and
inflexible
for
on
this
point
he
felt
that
his
honor
and
his
conscience
were
both
concerned
and
even
for
edith
sake
he
could
not
act
contrary
to
their
dictates
he
knew
that
danger
hung
over
his
head
and
though
he
would
not
shrink
from
it
himself
he
besought
her
to
seek
a
temporary
refuge
with
her
parents
and
remain
at
plymouth
until
the
threatened
storm
had
blown
over
but
it
was
now
turn
to
show
herself
firm
and
decided
and
so
clearly
did
roger
perceive
that
separation
would
be
to
her
a
far
greater
trial
than
any
other
that
could
befall
her
in
his
company
that
he
forbore
to
urge
a
measure
that
it
wrung
his
own
heart
to
propose
at
length
the
boding
storm
began
to
break
over
his
head
for
all
his
supposed
offences
he
was
again
summoned
before
the
general
assembly
at
boston
and
in
fear
and
anxiety
edith
saw
him
depart
she
knew
full
well
that
he
would
never
renounce
or
even
soften
down
his
opinions
through
any
fear
of
man
and
she
did
not
for
a
moment
desire
that
he
should
thus
lower
himself
in
her
estimation
and
his
own
but
she
also
knew
the
bitterness
of
the
enmity
felt
towards
him
by
the
authorities
at
boston
and
she
could
not
repress
her
apprehensions
of
its
consequences
as
she
anticipated
roger
refused
to
acknowledge
himself
guilty
of
an
offence
against
the
church
or
state
nor
would
he
even
yield
one
point
of
his
religious
or
political
opinions
during
a
long
disputation
with
the
celebrated
pastor
hooker
he
was
therefore
declared
contumacious
by
the
government
and
with
the
assent
of
all
the
assembled
clergy
except
his
friend
elliot
he
was
banished
from
the
territory
of
massachusetts
six
weeks
were
allowed
him
by
the
general
assembly
to
make
his
preparations
and
remove
beyond
the
boundary
of
their
dominions
but
as
this
term
would
have
brought
the
time
of
his
banishment
to
the
winter
season
when
such
a
journey
would
have
been
impracticable
he
was
afterwards
permitted
to
remain
at
salem
until
the
spring
with
great
apparent
unconcern
he
returned
to
his
home
where
his
fond
and
admiring
wife
welcomed
him
with
joy
and
strengthened
his
spirit
by
the
cheerful
manner
in
which
she
received
the
news
of
their
sentence
of
banishment
she
had
felt
an
undefined
dread
of
something
much
more
hard
to
bear
of
something
which
might
possibly
separate
her
husband
from
her
but
banishment
was
only
a
change
of
home
and
let
their
lot
be
cast
where
it
might
she
could
be
happy
indeed
she
entertained
a
hope
that
roger
would
consent
to
remove
to
plymouth
and
take
up
his
abode
there
which
would
have
given
her
extreme
satisfaction
but
she
soon
found
that
this
hope
could
not
be
accomplished
for
her
enthusiastic
husband
had
formed
a
design
of
founding
a
church
of
his
own
and
of
being
entirely
independent
of
all
government
in
spiritual
matters
in
order
to
carry
out
this
purpose
he
daringly
continued
to
hold
the
obnoxious
assemblies
in
his
own
house
and
to
instill
his
opinions
into
the
minds
of
the
many
young
and
zealous
friends
who
gathered
around
him
these
meetings
were
even
more
numerously
attended
after
his
return
from
boston
than
they
were
before
he
was
summoned
to
the
bar
of
the
general
assembly
for
persecution
and
injustice
naturally
recoil
on
the
perpetrators
of
it
and
the
victim
of
such
harsh
measures
is
sure
to
gain
friends
and
supporters
among
the
and
the
generous
a
report
of
these
proceedings
was
carried
to
boston
and
also
a
rumor
of
williams
supposed
plan
for
founding
an
independent
church
and
settlement
in
narragansett
bay
it
was
even
declared
that
some
of
his
friends
had
already
gone
off
to
the
south
and
were
seeking
a
fitting
spot
on
which
to
commence
building
this
information
roused
the
fears
as
well
as
the
wrath
of
the
government
the
eloquence
and
abilities
of
williams
were
well
known
to
the
rulers
and
they
dreaded
the
influence
that
he
would
inevitably
exercise
over
the
neighboring
churches
if
he
established
himself
and
his
followers
in
a
district
so
contiguous
to
their
own
they
therefore
resolved
to
employ
still
more
harsh
and
stringent
measures
than
had
yet
been
attempted
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
his
disorderly
proceedings
and
prevent
the
further
dissemination
of
his
opinions
he
was
accordingly
once
more
summoned
to
the
chief
town
and
had
he
obeyed
the
summons
he
was
to
have
been
forcibly
conveyed
on
board
a
vessel
then
in
the
harbor
and
sent
off
to
england
as
a
rebel
and
schismatic
unworthy
to
dwell
in
the
new
settlement
when
the
summons
arrived
at
salem
roger
was
ill
having
caught
a
fever
from
some
members
of
his
flock
on
whom
he
had
been
attending
and
he
therefore
replied
with
truth
that
it
would
endanger
his
life
to
attempt
the
journey
to
boston
his
serious
indisposition
had
occasioned
to
edith
much
anxiety
and
alarm
but
now
she
was
made
to
feel
how
often
those
events
which
we
regard
as
misfortunes
are
really
in
disguise
and
how
frequently
our
merciful
and
father
renders
them
the
means
of
our
preservation
from
far
greater
evils
it
would
be
well
if
the
conviction
of
this
blessed
truth
were
constantly
present
to
our
minds
how
many
anxious
cares
would
it
disperse
or
soothe
and
how
many
thanksgivings
would
it
call
forth
edith
felt
its
truth
and
its
consolation
as
she
sat
by
the
side
of
her
husband
couch
and
wrote
from
his
dictation
the
reply
that
saved
him
from
immediate
compliance
with
the
dreaded
summons
nothing
would
have
induced
roger
to
plead
illness
as
an
excuse
for
disobedience
unless
it
had
actually
existed
and
his
fearless
spirit
would
probably
have
led
him
into
the
snare
that
was
laid
for
him
edith
knew
this
secret
danger
for
governor
winthrop
who
had
seen
and
admired
her
on
one
of
his
visits
to
plymouth
and
who
now
kindly
sympathized
in
her
feelings
had
sent
her
a
private
note
by
the
messenger
in
which
he
warned
her
of
the
danger
that
waited
williams
at
boston
and
desired
her
by
some
means
to
prevent
his
appearing
before
the
general
assembly
winthrop
highly
disapproved
of
the
young
minister
bold
and
independent
conduct
but
he
shrunk
from
so
cruel
an
act
as
was
resolved
on
by
his
council
he
did
not
however
choose
to
declare
his
more
lenient
judgement
and
he
adopted
the
plan
of
informing
roger
wife
of
the
fate
that
was
designed
for
him
and
leaving
it
to
her
judgement
and
affection
to
take
the
proper
measures
to
avert
it
it
was
not
until
after
the
departure
of
the
messenger
that
edith
told
her
husband
of
winthrop
kind
interference
and
showed
him
his
note
the
indignation
of
williams
at
such
a
flagrant
disregard
of
all
common
justice
was
so
great
that
edith
feared
it
would
bring
on
an
accession
of
the
fever
it
however
acted
in
a
perfectly
contrary
manner
he
slept
well
that
night
and
the
following
morning
declared
his
intention
of
setting
off
immediately
to
boston
and
there
accusing
the
general
assembly
of
their
unlawful
intention
and
daring
them
to
put
it
into
execution
will
upbraid
them
with
their
injustice
and
charge
them
with
their
purposed
crime
he
exclaimed
and
his
fine
eyes
flashed
with
excitement
that
almost
made
edith
fear
that
the
fever
had
affected
his
mind
will
appeal
to
god
and
man
against
their
lawless
cruelty
he
continued
rouse
the
whole
colony
to
defend
my
right
to
liberty
of
thought
and
action
oh
roger
cried
his
wife
and
she
caught
his
burning
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
throbbing
heart
such
wild
and
desperate
words
would
you
drive
me
to
distraction
by
thus
throwing
yourself
into
the
power
of
your
bitter
and
relentless
enemies
who
in
boston
would
stand
up
to
defend
your
cause
who
could
deliver
you
from
the
evil
intentions
of
these
cruel
men
it
is
true
that
the
governor
has
shown
himself
your
friend
i
should
rather
say
my
friend
by
giving
me
this
secret
information
but
he
would
not
openly
espouse
your
cause
or
resist
the
will
of
the
assembly
why
then
should
you
spurn
from
you
the
means
of
safety
that
have
been
so
mercifully
afforded
and
tempt
providence
to
leave
you
to
your
fate
he
replied
and
the
bright
flush
faded
from
his
cheek
and
the
fire
in
his
eye
died
away
and
he
sank
again
upon
his
couch
you
have
subdued
my
spirit
or
perhaps
he
added
smiling
up
in
her
face
has
subdued
it
i
feel
that
i
have
no
strength
to
accomplish
what
i
desire
and
to
show
my
persecutors
that
liberty
of
thought
and
feeling
is
my
birthright
and
that
i
will
never
relinquish
the
privilege
i
must
therefore
submit
to
the
will
of
one
who
is
wiser
and
mightier
than
i
am
and
believe
me
my
edith
he
continued
as
he
saw
the
tears
falling
from
her
gentle
eyes
me
i
do
to
with
perfect
contentment
now
the
passion
the
sinful
passion
that
stirred
me
so
mightily
just
now
is
gone
and
i
feel
the
goodness
of
my
god
in
holding
me
back
from
the
rash
act
i
contemplated
and
from
rushing
upon
dangers
that
i
might
indeed
defy
but
could
not
hope
to
conquer
i
will
be
calm
my
love
and
you
shall
devise
some
means
for
my
escape
i
feel
assured
that
still
more
violent
measures
will
be
adopted
by
the
assembly
to
get
me
into
their
power
and
now
that
i
can
quietly
reflect
on
the
consequences
of
such
an
event
i
am
aware
that
they
would
probably
be
our
violent
and
indefinite
separation
i
could
not
bear
that
edith
though
i
believe
that
i
could
bear
much
to
vindicate
my
honor
how
changed
was
roger
countenance
now
all
passion
all
excitement
was
gone
and
the
natural
sweetness
of
his
disposition
and
tenderness
of
his
heart
resumed
their
interrupted
influence
over
his
whole
manner
and
expression
edith
thought
she
had
never
either
admired
or
loved
him
so
much
as
at
this
moment
when
he
had
conquered
his
impetuous
feelings
and
yielded
his
fiery
impulse
to
show
a
bold
resentment
of
injury
to
her
influence
and
persuasions
bless
you
my
own
roger
she
exclaimed
reward
your
better
resolution
by
granting
us
many
future
years
of
united
happiness
but
now
we
must
think
of
the
present
and
provide
for
its
emergencies
i
see
clearly
that
there
is
now
no
safety
for
you
in
salem
and
that
a
speedy
flight
can
alone
ensure
your
liberty
you
have
made
a
great
sacrifice
for
my
sake
and
i
will
also
make
one
for
yours
i
will
not
even
ask
to
fly
with
you
for
i
could
only
be
an
encumbrance
to
you
at
this
inclement
season
of
the
year
and
my
presence
here
may
be
of
use
to
you
my
heart
rebels
while
i
say
it
roger
but
you
must
go
alone
and
use
every
exertion
to
reach
plymouth
as
speedily
as
possible
when
you
are
safe
beneath
my
father
roof
then
will
be
time
enough
to
think
of
me
i
feel
no
doubt
that
governor
bradford
will
afford
you
every
assistance
in
his
power
and
probably
will
again
allow
the
vessel
that
brought
us
here
in
brighter
days
to
convey
me
once
more
to
you
and
to
happiness
edith
had
tried
to
speak
with
steadiness
and
composure
and
so
far
she
had
succeeded
tolerably
well
but
when
she
realized
to
herself
the
time
that
must
elapse
before
she
could
rejoin
her
husband
and
all
the
dangers
and
privations
that
might
await
him
in
the
interval
her
calmness
quite
gave
way
and
she
burst
into
tears
of
uncontrollable
agony
roger
strove
to
cheer
her
and
to
point
to
the
happy
future
that
he
trusted
was
in
store
for
them
if
not
on
earth
yet
assuredly
in
a
better
world
where
faithful
hearts
will
never
know
the
misery
of
parting
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
knelt
with
her
in
prayer
and
had
humbly
asked
to
meet
the
coming
trial
and
to
be
sanctified
by
it
that
her
tears
ceased
to
flow
and
a
smile
of
hope
and
resignation
illumined
her
interesting
countenance
must
act
now
roger
she
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
as
she
rose
from
her
knees
time
is
short
and
i
must
make
such
arrangements
for
your
comfort
during
your
journey
as
are
in
my
power
all
other
things
that
are
needful
to
you
i
will
endeavor
to
send
by
sea
to
plymouth
or
if
no
opportunity
occurs
during
the
winter
you
must
have
patience
until
i
can
convey
them
her
voice
again
trembled
and
unbidden
tears
again
rose
to
her
eyes
but
she
sought
relief
in
occupation
and
on
the
day
after
the
morrow
when
roger
was
to
commence
his
toilsome
journey
at
break
of
day
his
knapsack
was
ready
and
stored
with
everything
that
would
be
most
requisite
to
his
comfort
the
moment
of
parting
came
but
we
will
not
describe
it
it
was
borne
by
edith
as
a
devoted
christian
wife
can
bear
anything
that
is
necessary
for
the
safety
and
welfare
of
her
husband
but
when
he
was
gone
and
her
swimming
eyes
could
no
longer
see
his
beloved
form
or
catch
his
last
signal
of
farewell
the
whole
desolation
of
her
own
position
burst
upon
her
and
edith
was
for
a
time
bowed
down
with
grief
she
felt
herself
alone
in
the
world
and
she
shrank
from
seeking
comfort
or
sympathy
from
any
human
being
who
was
then
near
her
but
friends
whom
she
could
not
then
expect
to
see
were
near
and
the
wounded
heart
found
a
balm
and
a
consolation
beyond
its
hopes
the
very
evening
after
roger
departure
edith
spirit
was
cheered
by
the
arrival
of
elliot
and
his
wife
at
her
now
dreary
home
o
how
she
welcomed
them
and
how
deeply
they
sympathized
in
her
distress
and
anxiety
they
had
heard
of
the
last
summons
that
had
been
sent
from
the
general
assembly
and
had
hastened
to
salem
in
spite
of
the
severity
of
the
weather
to
offer
any
assistance
or
counsel
that
might
be
needed
by
either
roger
or
edith
they
rejoiced
with
much
thankfulness
when
they
heard
of
his
having
escaped
the
cruel
vengeance
of
his
adversaries
but
their
minds
were
filled
with
fear
and
anxiety
when
they
reflected
on
the
many
perils
that
he
might
encounter
on
his
long
journey
and
the
sufferings
from
cold
and
hunger
and
fatigue
that
he
must
endure
in
his
present
debilitated
state
of
health
they
did
not
however
add
to
edith
anxiety
by
telling
of
their
own
but
exerted
themselves
to
cheer
and
rouse
her
and
lead
her
to
place
a
perfect
trust
in
the
care
of
him
without
whose
permission
not
even
a
sparrow
can
fall
to
the
ground
the
wisdom
of
the
plan
that
edith
had
persuaded
her
husband
to
adopt
was
soon
but
too
apparent
for
in
a
few
days
a
pinnace
arrived
at
salem
bringing
an
officer
and
attendants
who
were
commissioned
by
the
general
assembly
to
seize
on
the
offending
pastor
and
convey
him
on
board
a
vessel
that
was
lying
at
nantasket
ready
for
sea
but
this
cruel
and
arbitrary
intention
was
happily
frustrated
the
officer
came
to
the
dwelling
of
williams
and
had
the
mortification
of
finding
that
he
had
been
gone
three
days
nor
could
all
his
threats
or
persuasions
obtain
from
any
of
the
inmates
the
least
information
concerning
his
flight
he
also
sought
out
and
strictly
interrogated
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
salem
who
were
known
to
be
the
partisans
of
this
persecuted
friend
of
liberty
but
although
they
were
well
acquainted
with
his
sudden
departure
and
his
destination
and
some
of
the
younger
men
were
even
preparing
to
follow
him
not
one
of
them
betrayed
their
respected
leader
the
officer
therefore
returned
to
boston
to
report
the
of
his
errand
which
excited
much
wrath
and
vexation
in
the
members
of
the
assembly
but
afforded
secret
satisfaction
to
the
amiable
governor
winthrop
who
had
unwillingly
submitted
to
the
decision
of
a
large
majority
of
the
government
and
who
had
kindly
exerted
himself
to
rescue
from
a
cruel
and
unjust
fate
the
man
whose
only
fault
consisted
in
a
determination
to
think
for
himself
meanwhile
the
fugitive
was
pursuing
his
slow
and
difficult
way
through
the
woods
and
wilds
to
the
south
of
salem
but
whither
should
he
direct
his
steps
every
road
out
of
the
district
must
lead
him
through
the
territory
of
his
foes
and
persecutors
and
he
dared
not
show
in
any
of
the
hamlets
or
villages
where
his
person
and
reputation
were
well
known
lest
he
should
be
seized
and
given
up
to
the
magistrates
of
boston
he
therefore
traveled
chiefly
by
night
guided
by
the
moon
and
stars
and
lay
concealed
in
some
damp
covert
or
rocky
ravine
during
the
day
the
small
stock
of
provisions
that
edith
had
placed
in
his
knapsack
was
soon
expended
and
for
some
days
he
subsisted
on
the
nuts
and
berries
that
still
remained
on
the
trees
at
length
he
felt
himself
safe
from
immediate
pursuit
and
changed
his
course
suddenly
to
the
east
he
emerged
from
the
shelter
of
the
woods
and
hurrying
across
the
open
plain
that
skirted
the
bay
he
found
himself
at
the
spot
which
he
desired
to
reach
this
was
a
little
cove
on
the
shore
surrounded
on
the
land
side
by
rocks
and
only
capable
of
receiving
a
small
boat
into
its
tranquil
harbor
as
roger
approached
the
water
edge
and
stepped
round
the
last
point
of
rock
that
concealed
the
inlet
he
made
a
signal
which
to
his
great
joy
was
instantly
replied
to
from
within
day
was
just
dawning
over
the
far
horizon
and
a
dim
twilight
shone
on
the
smooth
and
boundless
ocean
that
spread
to
the
east
a
few
light
strokes
of
an
oar
fell
on
ear
and
then
he
saw
the
white
spray
and
the
dark
form
of
a
boat
emerging
from
the
gloomy
cavern
that
was
formed
by
the
overhanging
rocks
in
a
moment
his
hand
was
grasped
in
that
of
a
friend
and
all
his
sense
of
loneliness
vanished
away
seaton
entreated
him
to
lose
no
time
in
entering
the
boat
and
leaving
the
inhospitable
shores
of
massachusetts
and
williams
gladly
obeyed
him
the
little
shallop
which
his
friends
at
salem
had
secretly
purchased
and
sent
by
one
of
the
most
devoted
of
their
number
to
meet
him
at
the
appointed
place
was
well
supplied
with
provisions
and
warm
clothing
which
proved
a
most
seasonable
relief
to
roger
but
the
most
acceptable
part
of
its
contents
was
a
letter
from
edith
informing
him
of
the
welcome
arrival
of
their
friends
the
elliots
at
salem
and
of
the
futile
efforts
of
the
men
of
boston
to
make
him
a
prisoner
edith
wrote
more
cheerfully
than
she
felt
and
she
spoke
of
the
happy
time
when
they
would
be
reunited
and
of
her
hopes
that
it
was
not
far
distant
assuring
him
that
she
was
willing
and
trusted
ere
long
to
be
able
to
follow
him
to
any
spot
where
he
might
fix
his
home
this
letter
and
the
refreshment
with
which
seaton
furnished
him
raised
his
drooping
and
exhausted
spirits
and
at
his
request
he
wrapped
himself
in
the
large
that
his
provident
wife
had
sent
for
him
and
lay
down
to
enjoy
the
first
calm
and
undisturbed
repose
that
had
been
permitted
to
him
since
he
left
his
beloved
home
silently
and
rapidly
the
little
boat
glided
over
the
calm
surface
of
the
bay
and
ere
long
it
was
opposite
to
the
harbor
of
boston
and
might
be
espied
by
some
of
the
vessels
lying
there
roger
still
slept
the
deep
sleep
of
exhaustion
and
security
but
seaton
now
required
his
aid
and
reluctantly
aroused
him
to
take
a
second
oar
and
speed
the
shallop
past
the
region
of
danger
roger
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seized
the
oar
and
the
boat
darted
forward
from
the
impulse
of
his
now
fresh
and
powerful
arm
it
passed
near
several
boats
belonging
to
the
bostoners
but
the
fugitive
drew
his
large
spanish
hat
over
his
brows
and
hid
his
form
and
dress
beneath
the
folds
of
the
ample
cloak
and
thus
escaped
detection
or
observation
it
was
his
intention
to
row
down
the
bay
as
far
as
new
plymouth
where
he
designed
to
visit
edith
parents
and
apprise
them
of
all
that
had
befallen
him
and
also
endeavor
to
prevail
on
bradford
to
send
a
vessel
as
soon
as
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
had
subsided
to
bring
his
wife
to
her
paternal
home
he
then
proposed
to
go
on
with
seaton
and
any
of
the
plymouthers
who
would
accompany
him
and
seek
a
settlement
further
to
the
south
in
some
part
of
narragansett
bay
but
this
scheme
was
not
permitted
to
be
carried
out
towards
evening
a
fresh
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
east
and
before
it
blew
so
violently
that
roger
and
his
companion
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
their
little
vessel
out
at
sea
and
preventing
its
being
dashed
on
the
coral
reefs
that
girt
that
and
coast
manfully
they
wrought
at
the
oars
but
their
strength
was
almost
exhausted
and
no
creek
or
inlet
offered
them
a
secure
refuge
still
they
persevered
for
it
was
a
struggle
for
life
the
least
remission
of
their
toil
would
have
placed
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
they
must
have
been
driven
violently
against
the
sunken
rocks
at
length
when
the
light
of
day
was
failing
them
and
they
began
to
give
themselves
up
as
lost
the
keen
eye
of
roger
espied
an
opening
through
the
reef
and
though
it
was
narrow
and
evidently
dangerous
he
and
seaton
resolved
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
pass
through
it
and
gain
the
smooth
still
waters
that
they
knew
must
lie
between
the
rock
and
the
shore
they
breathed
a
fervent
and
prayer
for
help
from
above
and
then
commenced
the
fearful
contest
the
moment
they
turned
the
prow
of
their
shallop
towards
the
shore
the
light
and
buoyant
little
vessel
darted
forward
impelled
by
both
wind
and
tide
and
mounted
like
a
seabird
on
the
rolling
waves
the
dashing
spray
fell
ever
it
almost
blinding
its
crew
and
the
helm
no
longer
had
power
to
divert
its
headlong
course
may
he
who
rules
the
storm
have
pity
on
my
edith
exclaimed
roger
as
he
saw
the
fail
extent
of
their
peril
and
not
a
fear
for
himself
crossed
his
steadfast
soul
the
lord
of
the
winds
and
the
waves
be
our
guide
and
protector
or
the
next
minute
will
be
our
last
he
clasped
his
hands
in
prayer
and
raised
his
kindling
eye
to
the
frowning
heavens
above
him
but
his
eye
of
faith
could
look
through
those
dark
clouds
and
see
a
father
hand
of
love
and
mercy
governing
and
controlling
the
elements
and
his
spirit
was
at
peace
god
be
praised
cried
seaton
as
he
drew
a
long
shivering
breath
and
snatching
up
both
the
oars
projected
them
on
each
side
of
the
boat
to
protect
it
from
the
rocks
that
bounded
the
narrow
channel
have
entered
the
passage
and
with
heaven
help
we
shall
yet
be
saved
they
had
indeed
dashed
straight
into
the
opening
that
divided
the
reef
and
through
which
the
waves
were
rushing
at
a
terrific
rate
and
their
only
apparent
chance
of
safety
lay
in
the
possibility
of
guiding
the
little
bark
through
the
channel
without
its
being
impelled
against
the
rugged
sides
williams
caught
one
of
the
oars
from
his
friend
and
both
directed
their
whole
strength
to
this
object
there
was
a
brief
interval
of
breathless
suspense
and
then
the
boat
struck
on
a
hidden
coral
rock
it
was
but
for
a
moment
another
swelling
wave
lifted
it
again
and
rolled
forward
bearing
the
little
vessel
on
its
summit
into
the
smooth
water
that
lay
like
a
narrow
lake
between
the
dangerous
reef
and
the
flat
sandy
shore
but
the
peril
was
not
yet
over
the
the
rock
though
momentary
had
been
so
violent
as
to
spring
a
leak
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
through
this
the
water
gushed
up
with
fearful
rapidity
threatening
to
sink
it
before
the
shore
could
be
reached
again
the
oars
were
pulled
with
the
strength
of
desperation
and
again
the
danger
was
averted
but
roger
williams
and
his
friend
found
themselves
on
a
desert
and
uninhabited
coast
with
a
useless
vessel
and
no
means
of
proceeding
to
plymouth
still
their
lives
had
been
providentially
preserved
and
they
were
deeply
grateful
to
the
divine
power
which
had
been
exerted
for
their
rescue
and
faith
and
courage
and
bodily
strength
were
their
portion
likewise
and
they
did
not
despair
they
slept
long
and
soundly
and
the
following
morning
having
ascertained
that
the
boat
was
too
seriously
injured
to
be
repaired
by
any
means
at
their
command
they
resolved
on
abandoning
it
and
recommenced
their
journey
on
foot
the
extreme
difficulty
of
reaching
plymouth
by
land
and
the
wide
circuit
from
the
course
that
he
wished
ultimately
to
pursue
that
must
be
traveled
in
order
to
reach
the
settlement
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
caused
williams
to
relinquish
that
part
of
his
plan
and
decide
on
striking
at
once
into
the
forest
and
pursuing
a
course
until
he
should
arrive
at
narragansett
bay
this
would
lead
him
through
the
trackless
woods
and
the
dreary
wilds
inhabited
only
by
the
barbarous
and
untutored
red
men
but
from
them
he
hoped
to
meet
with
that
hospitality
and
succor
which
was
denied
him
by
his
countrymen
and
chapter
xxi
alas
to
see
the
strength
that
clings
round
woman
in
such
hours
a
mournful
sight
though
lovely
an
of
the
springs
the
full
springs
of
affection
deep
and
bright
and
she
because
her
life
is
ever
twined
with
other
lives
and
by
no
stormy
wind
may
thence
be
shaken
and
because
the
light
of
tenderness
is
round
her
and
her
eye
doth
weep
such
passionate
tears
therefore
she
thus
endures
hemans
without
any
guide
roger
and
his
faithful
friend
seaton
wandered
through
the
wilderness
they
took
from
the
stranded
boat
as
much
of
food
and
other
useful
articles
as
they
could
carry
but
the
provision
did
not
last
long
and
before
they
reached
any
indian
encampment
they
were
seduced
to
extreme
want
and
suffering
their
clothes
were
drenched
by
the
frequent
heavy
rain
which
so
completely
saturated
the
ground
and
the
dead
branches
that
lay
strewed
upon
it
as
often
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
lighting
a
fire
their
nights
were
passed
on
the
damp
ground
or
beneath
any
sheltering
rock
that
they
could
find
and
once
a
hollow
tree
afforded
them
a
refuge
from
the
storm
that
raged
around
them
when
no
other
was
at
hand
at
length
after
fourteen
weeks
of
trial
and
hardship
they
reached
the
village
of
packanokick
where
dwelt
masasoyt
the
aged
sagamore
of
the
wampanoges
during
the
time
that
williams
had
resided
at
plymouth
he
had
learnt
the
language
of
the
natives
and
on
some
of
his
visits
to
the
village
of
mooanam
he
had
become
acquainted
with
his
father
masasoyt
the
chief
sachem
of
the
divided
tribe
the
regard
and
respect
with
which
his
eloquence
and
his
attractive
manners
had
inspired
the
younger
chieftain
were
fully
shared
by
the
sagamore
and
both
prince
and
people
learnt
to
love
and
reverence
the
man
who
honored
their
rights
respected
their
prejudices
and
prayed
to
his
god
for
their
welfare
his
appearance
in
the
village
of
masasoyt
was
hailed
with
joy
and
regarded
as
a
privilege
by
all
the
inhabitants
the
sachem
received
both
him
and
is
companion
with
kindness
and
hospitality
and
gave
them
a
chamber
in
his
own
lodge
which
if
not
remarkable
either
for
cleanliness
or
comfort
yet
seemed
a
luxurious
abode
to
men
who
had
passed
so
many
days
and
nights
in
the
unsheltered
depths
of
the
forest
on
the
following
morning
when
food
and
rest
had
somewhat
restored
the
exhausted
strength
of
the
travelers
masasoyt
invited
williams
to
a
private
conference
in
which
he
informed
him
that
a
serious
quarrel
had
again
arisen
between
his
tribe
and
that
of
cundineus
the
chief
of
the
narragansetts
and
he
entreated
him
to
use
all
his
powerful
influence
with
the
latter
to
heal
the
present
dissension
and
prevent
the
dispute
from
ending
in
open
hostilities
williams
undertook
this
negotiation
with
much
satisfaction
for
was
not
only
in
accordance
with
his
feelings
and
with
the
duty
of
his
profession
but
he
also
desired
to
secure
the
favor
and
protection
of
the
narragansett
chief
on
the
borders
of
whose
dominions
he
designed
to
fix
his
future
home
he
therefore
made
no
delay
in
setting
out
with
a
few
indian
attendants
on
the
proposed
expedition
and
in
a
few
days
returned
to
packanokick
with
the
welcome
intelligence
that
the
wrath
of
cundincus
was
appeased
and
that
he
had
listened
favorably
to
the
explanation
of
his
rival
chieftain
the
old
narragansett
chief
also
was
so
captivated
by
the
english
stranger
and
so
won
by
his
peculiar
eloquence
that
we
are
told
that
barbarous
heart
of
the
old
prince
loved
him
like
a
son
to
his
latest
breath
and
his
nephew
and
the
young
miantonomo
also
regarded
him
as
a
friend
and
placed
in
him
a
perfect
confidence
no
one
thankfully
exclaimed
williams
in
his
diary
providence
these
ravens
fed
me
in
the
wilderness
but
inactive
repose
was
neither
the
wish
nor
the
lot
of
roger
williams
and
he
earnestly
desired
to
reach
the
spot
where
he
proposed
to
found
his
new
settlement
and
prepare
a
home
for
his
beloved
edith
and
from
whence
also
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
send
a
letter
to
salem
or
to
plymouth
which
might
allay
the
anxious
fears
that
he
well
knew
she
had
so
long
been
enduring
since
he
had
received
the
letter
that
seaton
brought
him
from
his
wife
he
had
not
had
any
opportunity
of
conveying
to
her
the
intelligence
of
his
own
safety
or
of
hearing
from
her
whether
her
strength
and
spirits
were
supported
under
the
protracted
trial
of
absence
and
anxiety
he
knew
also
that
ere
this
time
he
had
reason
to
believe
himself
a
father
and
his
heart
yearned
to
be
assured
of
the
welfare
of
his
wife
and
child
and
to
see
them
safely
lodged
beneath
the
shelter
of
his
own
roof
it
was
a
source
of
extreme
consolation
to
him
under
all
his
feelings
of
anxiety
to
believe
that
his
edith
had
been
cheered
and
supported
by
the
presence
of
dame
elliot
and
her
excellent
husband
who
he
felt
assured
would
not
leave
her
until
she
could
be
removed
either
to
plymouth
or
to
her
husband
new
abode
and
to
their
kind
care
and
the
protection
of
his
heavenly
father
he
was
contented
to
leave
her
while
he
used
every
effort
to
procure
for
her
a
safe
and
happy
home
in
which
he
could
hope
ere
long
to
welcome
her
he
therefore
lost
no
time
in
concluding
a
bargain
with
masasoyt
for
a
piece
of
land
in
the
district
called
seacomb
not
far
from
the
east
arm
of
narragansett
bay
and
thither
he
proceeded
with
seaton
and
commenced
building
and
planting
from
this
place
he
found
means
to
convey
intelligence
both
to
salem
and
plymouth
of
the
safe
termination
of
his
perilous
journey
and
his
intention
to
fix
his
settlement
on
the
piece
of
ground
that
he
had
purchased
his
messengers
returned
after
a
considerable
interval
and
brought
him
a
letter
from
his
now
joyful
wife
which
gladdened
his
heart
with
the
welcome
news
of
her
health
and
safety
and
that
also
of
his
little
daughter
edith
this
name
she
told
him
had
been
given
to
the
infant
in
accordance
with
what
she
knew
to
be
his
wish
and
his
friend
john
elliot
who
with
his
wife
had
resided
chiefly
at
salem
since
his
departure
had
performed
the
rite
of
baptism
she
further
informed
him
that
governor
bradford
on
hearing
of
her
lonely
position
had
kindly
promised
to
send
a
vessel
for
her
and
as
the
severity
of
winter
had
already
partially
subsided
she
was
in
daily
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
the
pinnace
which
would
carry
her
back
to
the
happy
home
of
her
youth
and
then
she
hoped
the
time
would
not
be
long
until
she
could
rejoin
her
husband
and
once
more
be
at
peace
footnote
now
reheboth
this
letter
called
forth
the
lively
joy
and
gratitude
of
roger
and
animated
him
to
fresh
zeal
and
activity
in
all
his
proceedings
at
seacomb
he
was
also
encouraged
greatly
by
the
arrival
at
the
same
time
of
five
of
his
most
devoted
adherents
from
salem
who
had
no
sooner
learnt
from
his
indian
messenger
of
his
arrival
at
the
place
of
his
destination
than
they
determined
to
accompany
the
friendly
savage
on
his
return
to
seacomb
and
assist
their
friend
and
teacher
in
all
his
labors
for
the
formation
of
an
independent
settlement
all
this
visa
cheering
and
satisfactory
but
the
trials
of
this
undaunted
man
were
not
over
yet
his
trusty
messenger
had
brought
him
another
dispatch
which
he
had
not
yet
attended
to
he
now
opened
it
and
found
that
it
came
from
the
governor
of
plymouth
and
contained
an
earnest
injunction
to
him
to
abandon
seacomb
which
he
informed
him
was
included
in
their
patent
and
to
remove
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
that
formed
their
boundary
where
he
could
be
free
and
independent
like
themselves
accepted
his
wise
counsel
as
a
voice
from
god
wrote
williams
and
he
immediately
resolved
to
be
guided
by
it
and
again
commence
his
wanderings
in
a
frail
indian
canoe
he
and
his
companions
rowed
up
the
arm
of
the
sea
now
called
the
river
seacock
they
knew
not
where
to
land
or
where
again
to
pitch
their
tent
in
the
wilderness
but
they
were
soon
guided
by
the
friendly
voices
of
a
party
of
narragansetts
on
the
opposite
shore
these
natives
had
recognized
their
friend
williams
and
now
shouted
out
in
broken
english
the
welcome
words
cheer
the
sound
fell
like
music
on
the
ears
of
the
desolate
exiles
and
in
remembrance
of
the
event
the
spot
of
ground
where
they
first
landed
on
the
narragansett
territory
received
the
name
of
cheer
which
it
still
retains
a
spring
called
spring
is
also
shown
by
the
present
inhabitants
of
this
district
in
proud
and
grateful
memory
of
the
spot
where
the
founder
of
a
future
free
state
first
set
foot
on
shore
the
place
where
the
wanderer
landed
was
called
by
the
indians
maushasuck
and
it
was
made
over
to
him
by
the
generous
cundincus
as
a
free
and
absolute
possession
and
also
all
the
land
included
between
the
rivers
pawtucket
and
maushasuck
this
property
he
shared
equally
with
his
present
comrades
and
also
with
some
others
who
shortly
after
joined
him
from
salem
and
made
their
whole
number
amount
to
thirteen
he
did
not
reserve
any
advantage
to
himself
although
the
land
actually
belonged
to
him
alone
but
divided
it
into
thirteen
equal
portions
on
each
of
which
a
rude
hut
was
immediately
erected
these
were
soon
improved
and
became
a
rising
village
to
which
williams
gave
the
name
of
providence
in
grateful
remembrance
of
the
divine
guidance
and
protection
which
had
brought
him
at
length
to
haven
where
he
would
be
footnote
now
called
the
providence
river
he
and
his
associates
united
themselves
into
a
sort
of
fellowship
and
independent
church
and
one
of
the
first
rules
which
they
laid
down
for
their
future
guidance
and
government
was
that
no
one
should
ever
suffer
in
that
settlement
for
conscience
sake
it
was
summer
when
the
little
village
began
to
be
built
and
before
the
land
could
be
cleared
and
prepared
for
cultivation
the
season
was
too
far
advanced
to
allow
any
hope
of
a
the
new
settlers
had
therefore
to
endure
the
same
poverty
and
privation
that
had
been
the
lot
of
the
earlier
planters
in
new
england
they
had
no
means
of
obtaining
any
of
the
comforts
of
civilized
life
except
from
boston
or
plymouth
and
as
they
possessed
no
vessel
besides
an
indian
canoe
this
was
a
service
of
toil
and
much
hazard
still
they
did
not
repine
for
liberty
was
here
their
precious
portion
and
hope
for
the
future
sustained
them
through
the
trials
of
the
present
time
but
where
was
edith
where
was
that
woman
while
her
husband
was
thus
struggling
with
difficulties
and
privations
she
was
where
both
inclination
and
duty
had
led
her
by
his
side
and
smiling
at
trials
that
she
was
permitted
to
share
with
him
and
to
lighten
by
her
presence
we
must
here
revert
to
the
time
before
edith
had
been
blessed
by
receiving
intelligence
of
her
husband
from
seacomb
and
had
so
cheerfully
replied
to
the
note
which
he
wrote
to
her
on
a
scrap
of
paper
torn
from
his
pocket
book
in
order
not
to
interrupt
the
history
of
roger
difficulties
and
their
successful
issue
we
have
not
yet
narrated
the
trials
that
his
exemplary
wife
had
endured
and
endured
with
a
resolution
and
fortitude
equal
to
his
own
when
the
joyful
news
of
roger
safety
reached
edith
at
salem
she
was
slowly
recovering
from
a
long
and
dangerous
illness
which
anxiety
and
sorrow
had
brought
on
her
a
few
weeks
after
the
birth
of
her
child
through
all
her
sufferings
of
mind
end
body
dame
elliot
had
been
her
nurse
and
her
comforter
and
she
and
her
husband
had
sacrificed
their
own
domestic
comfort
and
their
own
humble
but
cherished
home
to
lessen
the
sorrows
of
their
afflicted
friend
all
the
consolation
that
human
sympathy
and
affection
could
afford
to
edith
was
given
by
these
true
christian
friends
and
all
the
spiritual
strength
that
the
prayers
end
exhortations
of
such
a
minister
as
elliot
could
impart
to
a
sorrowing
spirit
were
received
and
gratefully
appreciated
by
the
object
of
his
solicitude
and
care
but
when
weeks
and
months
had
elapsed
and
still
no
tidings
came
of
the
beloved
wanderer
what
hope
could
be
given
to
the
desolate
heart
of
edith
her
friends
had
themselves
given
up
all
hope
of
roger
having
survived
the
toils
end
privations
of
the
journey
and
how
could
they
bid
his
wife
cheer
up
and
look
for
brighter
days
which
they
believed
would
never
come
a
letter
which
edith
received
from
her
parents
by
the
captain
of
a
from
plymouth
too
clearly
proved
that
williams
had
never
reached
that
settlement
and
from
that
day
the
health
and
spirits
of
his
wife
visibly
declined
she
did
not
give
way
to
violent
grief
but
a
settled
melancholy
dwelt
on
her
pale
and
lovely
countenance
and
all
the
thoughtful
abstraction
of
her
early
year
which
happiness
had
chased
from
her
features
returned
again
no
object
but
her
infant
seemed
to
rouse
her
and
then
it
was
only
to
tears
but
tears
were
better
than
that
look
of
deep
and
speechless
sorrow
that
generally
met
the
anxious
gaze
of
her
friends
and
made
them
at
times
apprehensive
for
her
reason
at
length
her
physical
powers
gave
way
and
a
violent
attack
of
fever
brought
edith
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
during
this
period
both
elliot
and
his
wife
devoted
themselves
day
and
night
to
the
poor
sufferer
whose
mind
wandered
continually
and
whose
lamentations
for
the
beloved
one
whom
she
mourned
as
dead
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
her
faithful
friends
they
had
no
hope
of
her
recovery
nor
could
they
heartily
desire
it
for
they
believed
her
earthly
happiness
was
wrecked
for
ever
and
they
could
ask
no
better
fate
for
her
than
a
speedy
reunion
with
her
roger
in
a
home
beyond
the
grave
her
child
they
looked
on
as
their
own
and
cherished
her
with
almost
a
parent
love
and
care
while
they
resolved
to
bring
her
up
in
those
high
and
holy
principles
that
had
been
so
nobly
contended
for
by
her
unfortunate
father
and
so
beautifully
exemplified
in
the
amiable
character
of
her
mother
the
fever
ran
high
and
bore
down
all
the
strength
both
moral
and
physical
of
its
victim
at
length
after
days
and
nights
of
restlessness
and
delirium
a
deep
and
heavy
sleep
came
on
and
edith
lay
still
and
motionless
for
hours
while
her
untiring
friends
sat
watching
her
in
silence
and
offering
up
fervent
prayers
for
the
soul
that
seemed
to
be
departing
during
this
anxious
period
a
gentle
knock
was
made
at
the
door
and
elliot
on
opening
it
was
presented
by
edith
single
attendant
with
the
small
packet
that
roger
indian
messenger
had
brought
for
her
mistress
in
trembling
agitation
the
pastor
showed
the
direction
which
he
knew
to
be
in
his
friend
handwriting
to
his
wife
and
now
indeed
they
lifted
up
their
hearts
to
the
god
who
heareth
prayer
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
recall
the
precious
life
that
seemed
to
be
fast
ebbing
away
and
to
permit
his
tried
and
faithful
servants
again
to
be
united
and
enjoy
the
happiness
that
yet
might
be
their
portion
on
earth
noiselessly
elliot
glided
from
the
room
for
he
feared
to
awaken
the
sleeper
and
sought
the
friendly
indian
from
whom
he
learnt
the
good
news
of
roger
safety
and
all
the
particulars
that
the
red
man
could
relate
concerning
him
he
then
returned
to
edith
chamber
and
in
a
low
whisper
communicated
all
that
he
had
heard
to
his
wife
and
consulted
with
her
as
to
the
best
method
of
communicating
the
startling
tidings
to
edith
should
she
ever
awake
from
her
present
slumber
they
were
still
engaged
in
earnest
but
scarcely
audible
conversation
when
dame
elliot
who
did
not
cease
from
watching
her
patient
observed
her
open
her
large
eyes
and
fix
them
with
a
look
of
intelligent
inquiry
on
herself
and
her
husband
she
made
a
sign
to
him
and
he
likewise
was
struck
with
the
evident
change
in
edith
countenance
and
filled
with
hope
that
her
reason
had
perfectly
returned
this
hope
was
quickly
confirmed
by
the
invalid
saying
in
a
very
low
voice
but
in
a
collected
manner
have
slept
very
long
and
my
dreams
have
been
very
painful
i
dreamt
that
i
was
alone
in
the
world
and
that
an
angel
came
to
take
my
soul
where
he
had
gone
to
dwell
and
then
just
as
i
bade
farewell
to
earth
a
little
form
came
between
me
and
the
angel
and
held
me
back
where
is
that
little
being
dame
elliot
let
me
look
on
her
that
my
trembling
spirit
may
be
stayed
no
roger
no
i
must
not
ask
to
follow
you
yet
edith
seemed
too
weak
for
tears
or
for
any
strong
emotion
but
she
closed
her
eyes
and
slowly
clasped
her
almost
transparent
hands
upon
her
breast
and
looked
so
still
and
colorless
that
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
marble
monument
but
for
the
dark
waving
hair
that
fell
upon
her
pillow
and
shaded
her
snowy
neck
dame
elliot
took
up
the
infant
from
its
little
wicker
cradle
and
held
it
towards
edith
saying
gently
up
my
edith
and
bless
the
little
being
that
god
has
given
to
call
you
back
to
life
and
happiness
murmured
edith
word
has
no
meaning
for
me
duty
is
my
only
tie
to
life
but
she
did
look
up
and
as
her
eyes
were
long
end
fondly
fixed
on
the
unconscious
features
of
the
child
her
own
sweet
look
of
gentleness
rose
into
them
again
and
she
raised
her
feeble
arms
as
if
to
take
the
infant
he
will
never
see
her
she
whispered
will
never
look
on
his
child
in
this
world
elliot
thought
that
hope
might
now
be
given
without
danger
and
he
took
her
wasted
hand
in
his
and
said
you
have
had
much
sorrow
and
it
has
nearly
brought
you
down
to
the
grave
but
can
you
bear
to
feel
the
agitation
of
hope
can
you
listen
calmly
while
i
tell
you
that
some
tidings
of
your
husband
have
reached
us
and
that
he
was
certainly
alive
after
the
time
when
you
believed
him
dead
he
paused
and
looked
anxiously
to
see
the
effect
of
this
sentence
and
he
was
almost
awed
by
the
expression
of
edith
countenance
it
was
not
agitation
it
was
not
joy
it
was
not
trembling
uncertainty
but
it
was
a
look
of
concentrated
mental
power
and
endurance
and
of
speechless
inquiry
that
seemed
to
say
utter
my
sentence
of
life
or
death
and
do
it
quickly
dame
elliot
could
not
bear
it
bursting
into
tears
of
deep
emotion
she
beat
down
and
imprinted
a
kiss
on
edith
cold
brow
while
she
exclaimed
in
broken
accents
it
is
true
dearest
edith
you
may
live
and
live
we
hope
for
happiness
as
great
as
has
ever
been
your
portion
my
god
cried
is
too
much
too
much
of
joy
for
one
so
weak
and
faithless
but
tell
me
my
friends
tell
me
all
i
can
bear
it
now
gently
and
gradually
elliot
prepared
her
for
the
blissful
certainty
of
her
husband
safety
and
when
he
found
that
illness
had
not
greatly
weakened
her
natural
strength
of
mind
and
that
she
could
bear
the
joy
that
awaited
her
he
gave
her
roger
own
letter
and
felt
assured
that
the
tears
she
at
length
shed
at
the
sight
of
his
would
relieve
and
calm
her
heart
in
this
he
judged
truly
for
though
edith
was
greatly
exhausted
after
this
strong
excitement
yet
she
passed
a
tranquil
night
and
was
so
much
recovered
on
the
following
morning
as
to
be
able
to
converse
composedly
with
her
kind
friends
the
fever
had
passed
away
and
the
sense
of
restored
happiness
joined
to
youth
and
a
naturally
good
constitution
had
a
rapid
effect
in
renovating
her
strength
and
spirits
and
recalling
a
faint
bloom
to
her
cheek
before
the
indian
set
out
on
his
return
to
seacomb
she
insisted
on
seeing
him
and
herself
delivering
to
him
a
letter
to
roger
in
which
she
had
carefully
avoided
all
mention
of
her
illness
she
made
numerous
inquiries
of
him
relative
to
her
husband
health
and
present
situation
and
charged
him
to
convey
her
packet
safely
and
tell
his
employer
that
he
had
seen
her
and
his
child
well
and
happy
she
could
say
this
with
truth
for
so
rapidly
had
she
recovered
that
the
inexperienced
eye
of
the
indian
could
detect
no
remaining
indisposition
in
the
slight
and
graceful
form
of
the
interesting
or
any
trace
of
disease
in
the
bright
eye
that
smiled
so
kindly
upon
him
he
departed
with
the
friends
of
williams
and
earnestly
did
his
wife
wish
that
it
had
been
possible
for
her
to
accompany
them
and
join
her
husband
at
once
but
this
could
not
be
and
she
could
only
endeavor
to
regain
her
strength
so
as
to
be
able
to
proceed
to
plymouth
as
soon
as
the
promised
vessel
arrived
in
due
time
it
came
and
bidding
her
kind
and
devoted
friends
an
affectionate
farewell
edith
and
her
child
embarked
with
all
the
little
property
that
remained
to
her
and
soon
found
herself
once
more
beneath
the
peaceful
roof
of
her
parents
until
she
arrived
at
plymouth
she
was
not
aware
of
the
fresh
trial
that
had
befallen
her
husband
in
being
compelled
to
abandon
his
settlement
at
seacomb
and
remove
into
the
narragansett
district
this
change
was
distressing
to
her
as
it
net
only
placed
the
lines
of
her
future
habitation
at
a
greater
distance
from
her
parents
and
friends
at
new
plymouth
but
also
removed
it
further
from
all
civilized
life
and
into
a
district
inhabited
by
a
tribe
whom
she
had
learnt
to
dread
from
her
childhood
as
the
rivals
and
foes
of
the
friendly
wampanoges
still
these
considerations
did
not
in
any
measure
abate
her
eagerness
to
fellow
roger
and
take
her
part
in
all
his
toils
and
anxieties
the
winter
had
passed
away
and
though
far
from
genial
the
weather
was
more
tolerable
for
travelling
and
edith
resolved
to
set
out
all
the
arguments
and
entreaties
of
helen
and
rodolph
to
induce
her
to
delay
her
journey
for
some
months
were
ineffectual
her
husband
lived
and
he
was
suffering
hardship
and
could
she
remain
separated
from
him
now
that
her
own
strength
had
been
restored
the
only
concession
she
could
be
persuaded
to
make
was
to
wait
until
some
friend
from
plymouth
was
found
to
accompany
her
gladly
would
her
father
have
done
so
but
he
was
suffering
so
severely
from
the
ague
that
so
often
attacked
the
settlement
in
the
spring
months
as
to
be
perfectly
incompetent
to
attempt
the
toilsome
journey
no
vessel
could
now
be
procured
and
it
was
on
foot
that
edith
proposed
to
traverse
the
wide
extent
of
wilderness
that
stretched
between
plymouth
and
roger
place
of
refuge
two
faithful
and
active
indians
were
appointed
by
mooanam
to
be
her
guides
and
to
carry
the
infant
which
she
would
not
consent
to
leave
behind
her
and
in
order
that
this
might
be
accomplished
with
greater
facility
apannow
provided
her
with
one
of
the
indian
cradles
or
rather
pouches
in
which
the
red
squaws
so
commonly
carry
their
young
children
on
their
backs
this
was
thickly
lined
with
soft
and
elastic
and
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
designed
all
was
prepared
and
the
impatient
edith
only
waited
for
a
companion
from
among
her
own
countrymen
who
were
all
so
much
occupied
at
that
busy
season
as
to
feel
little
disposed
to
undertake
so
long
a
journey
but
she
found
one
at
length
who
was
sufficiently
interested
in
her
happiness
and
that
of
her
husband
to
leave
his
home
and
his
occupations
and
offer
to
be
her
protector
this
was
the
excellent
edward
winslow
who
had
been
her
father
constant
friend
ever
since
their
first
emigration
and
who
bad
also
learnt
to
know
and
value
roger
williams
during
his
residence
at
plymouth
with
such
a
companion
edith
felt
she
had
nothing
to
fear
and
her
anxious
parents
committed
her
to
his
care
with
greater
confidence
than
they
would
have
done
to
that
of
any
other
protector
his
natural
sagacity
his
courage
and
his
knowledge
of
the
indians
and
their
language
rendered
him
peculiarly
suitable
for
the
enterprise
and
his
warm
friendship
for
rodolph
and
all
his
family
and
the
lively
powers
of
his
pious
and
intelligent
mind
ensured
to
edith
both
a
kind
and
an
agreeable
nevertheless
it
was
not
without
many
prayers
and
tears
that
helen
saw
her
daughter
once
more
leave
her
childhood
home
and
commence
her
journey
but
edith
spirits
were
joyous
and
her
hopes
were
high
and
her
child
lay
smiling
contentedly
in
its
strange
nest
which
was
slung
on
the
shoulders
of
one
of
the
indian
guides
the
other
carried
a
small
stock
of
provisions
and
other
necessaries
and
thus
the
little
party
set
forth
we
will
rot
follow
them
day
by
day
in
their
fatiguing
journey
but
merely
state
that
its
length
and
difficulty
exceeded
even
the
expectations
of
edith
and
her
companion
but
never
damped
the
persevering
courage
of
the
former
or
drew
from
her
a
complaint
or
a
wish
to
return
she
only
felt
that
every
step
however
rough
and
toilsome
carried
her
nearer
to
the
object
that
was
dearest
to
her
on
earth
and
this
conviction
supported
her
when
otherwise
her
strength
must
have
failed
sometimes
an
indian
wigwam
afforded
her
rest
and
shelter
but
frequently
a
bed
of
dry
leaves
and
a
roof
of
boughs
were
the
best
lodging
that
winslow
and
the
indians
could
provide
for
her
and
her
little
infant
happily
the
weather
was
calm
and
mild
and
the
season
sufficiently
advanced
to
enable
the
indians
to
find
a
quantity
of
nutritious
roots
which
with
the
meal
or
nokake
that
they
carried
with
them
or
procured
from
the
natives
by
the
way
formed
the
chief
subsistence
of
the
party
occasionally
their
fare
was
improved
by
a
wild
turkey
or
wood
duck
or
perhaps
a
squirrel
or
hare
that
winslow
brought
down
with
his
gun
but
often
the
day
journey
was
performed
with
no
other
refreshment
than
a
few
spoonsful
of
dry
meal
and
a
draught
of
cold
water
until
something
more
nourishing
could
be
procured
at
their
place
of
repose
for
the
right
roger
williams
was
standing
one
evening
on
the
bank
of
the
river
or
rather
arm
of
the
sea
called
seacock
near
the
spot
where
he
had
first
landed
and
to
which
he
had
given
the
name
of
cheer
he
was
examining
the
and
contriving
some
means
of
turning
it
into
a
sort
of
harbor
for
canoes
that
belonged
to
the
settlers
in
his
new
village
when
his
attention
was
attracted
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
by
hearing
his
own
name
loudly
called
by
native
voices
he
looked
to
the
spot
and
saw
two
indians
plunge
into
the
water
and
swim
rapidly
towards
him
and
as
they
did
so
he
also
observed
two
other
figures
emerge
from
a
grove
of
trees
that
reached
nearly
to
the
eastern
brink
of
the
inlet
the
distance
was
considerable
but
roger
keen
eye
could
discern
that
one
of
them
was
a
female
form
and
as
they
approached
nearer
to
the
water
edge
and
the
rays
of
the
evening
sun
fell
brightly
upon
them
he
also
saw
that
the
arms
of
that
graceful
and
familiar
form
carried
an
infant
it
is
an
illusion
he
exclaimed
i
have
so
long
pictured
to
my
mind
that
blessed
sight
that
at
length
my
fancy
seems
realized
it
can
not
be
but
again
his
name
was
called
not
now
with
an
indian
accent
but
in
the
manly
english
tones
of
edward
winslow
down
a
canoe
roger
he
shouted
across
the
water
and
your
child
can
not
swim
this
arm
of
the
sea
it
was
then
true
edith
his
beloved
wife
was
there
and
only
that
narrow
inlet
divided
them
the
indians
had
sprung
to
the
shore
and
were
waiting
his
directions
to
go
in
search
of
a
canoe
but
for
a
few
moments
he
did
not
regard
them
so
riveted
were
his
eyes
and
all
his
senses
on
the
opposite
shore
but
now
he
remembered
that
only
by
means
of
a
boat
could
he
attain
that
shore
and
making
a
signal
of
wild
joy
and
welcome
to
edith
he
hurried
up
the
creek
with
the
indians
and
rapidly
unloosed
the
moorings
of
his
canoe
which
lay
securely
behind
a
projecting
rock
he
leaped
into
it
leaving
the
natives
on
the
shore
and
paddled
the
canoe
swiftly
down
the
creek
to
the
spot
where
edith
stood
waiting
to
receive
him
trembling
with
agitation
and
joy
when
the
first
burst
of
emotion
at
this
meeting
with
his
wife
and
hitherto
unknown
child
had
subsided
roger
warmly
welcomed
the
friend
who
had
so
kindly
protected
them
during
their
long
journey
and
brought
them
to
the
wild
spot
that
was
now
his
only
home
he
then
led
them
to
the
canoe
and
with
winslow
assistance
soon
rowed
them
to
the
other
side
and
conducted
them
to
his
infant
settlement
the
huts
were
indeed
erected
and
covered
in
with
shingle
roofs
but
their
appearance
promised
little
of
outward
comfort
to
edith
yet
an
inward
joy
and
satisfaction
were
now
permitted
to
her
which
at
one
time
she
had
never
hoped
to
enjoy
again
on
earth
and
all
externals
were
as
nothing
when
compared
with
this
nevertheless
she
exerted
herself
with
all
a
woman
taste
and
skill
to
arrange
the
simple
furniture
of
the
hut
and
even
to
add
a
something
of
decoration
and
both
her
husband
and
winslow
wondered
at
the
improvement
which
she
soon
effected
in
the
appearance
of
the
dwelling
and
the
ingenuity
with
which
she
converted
the
rudest
materials
into
articles
of
use
or
ornament
her
joyous
spirits
and
active
moments
gave
a
life
and
animation
to
the
hitherto
dreary
scene
and
roger
felt
that
he
had
indeed
in
her
a
helpmate
who
would
cheer
the
loneliest
situation
and
shed
a
grace
and
charm
ever
poverty
itself
winslow
appreciated
all
her
excellent
and
amiable
qualities
very
highly
also
and
yet
he
lamented
the
lot
of
both
his
friends
who
had
to
endure
in
this
comparative
solitude
all
the
struggles
and
all
the
hardships
that
the
pilgrim
fathers
had
once
encountered
and
had
now
conquered
but
the
visit
of
this
and
pious
soul
as
roger
described
edward
winslow
very
greatly
cheered
the
heart
of
the
exiles
he
remained
for
many
weeks
in
the
new
settlement
and
only
left
it
when
the
advance
of
the
season
warned
him
that
the
short
indian
summer
was
drawing
to
an
end
a
vessel
which
arrived
at
that
time
from
plymouth
and
which
brought
the
wives
and
families
of
several
of
the
settlers
afforded
him
the
means
of
returning
by
sea
and
avoiding
the
tedious
land
journey
he
departed
with
the
thanks
and
blessings
of
his
friends
to
convey
to
edith
parents
the
happy
intelligence
that
she
was
both
well
and
happy
and
that
it
was
evident
her
cheerful
spirit
had
power
to
sustain
her
through
every
difficulty
by
which
she
might
be
surrounded

archbishop
leighton
for
a
long
period
an
unbroken
peace
had
subsisted
between
the
english
settlers
and
the
native
tribes
but
this
could
no
longer
be
maintained
and
a
succession
of
petty
injuries
and
mutual
misunderstandings
brought
about
a
state
of
hostility
that
the
pilgrim
fathers
had
labored
and
generally
with
success
to
avert
their
kind
and
equitable
treatment
of
the
indians
had
not
been
as
we
have
had
occasion
to
show
adopted
by
the
later
emigrants
and
doubt
and
suspicion
had
taken
the
place
of
that
confidence
and
respect
with
which
the
red
men
had
soon
learnt
to
regard
the
settlers
of
new
plymouth
the
recent
colony
of
connecticut
which
was
composed
of
bands
of
settlers
from
plymouth
and
massachusetts
and
also
a
few
dutch
planters
first
came
into
hostile
collision
with
the
natives
the
settlers
of
new
plymouth
had
entered
upon
an
almost
deserted
land
those
of
massachusetts
had
ensured
to
themselves
safety
by
their
superior
strength
and
those
among
the
narragansetts
were
protected
from
injury
by
the
friendly
feelings
of
the
neighboring
indians
but
the
settlement
of
connecticut
was
surrounded
by
hardy
and
hostile
races
and
could
only
enjoy
security
so
long
as
the
mutual
hatred
of
the
native
tribes
prevented
them
from
uniting
against
the
intruders
in
the
extreme
west
of
the
narragansett
district
and
near
the
entrance
of
long
island
sound
dwelt
a
powerful
division
of
the
pequodees
of
that
race
of
red
warriors
whose
pride
and
ambition
caused
them
to
be
both
feared
and
hated
by
the
other
tribes
in
the
vicinity
they
could
bring
upwards
of
seven
hundred
warriors
into
the
field
and
their
chief
sassacus
had
in
common
with
almost
all
the
great
indian
sagamores
a
number
of
subordinate
chiefs
who
yielded
to
him
a
certain
degree
of
obedience
the
narragansetts
were
the
only
tribe
that
could
at
all
compete
in
strength
with
the
fierce
and
haughty
pequodees
and
their
young
chieftain
miantonomo
was
already
regarded
by
sassacus
as
a
dangerous
rival
such
was
the
feeling
that
existed
among
the
tribes
near
the
settlements
of
connecticut
when
an
event
occurred
that
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
whole
community
two
merchants
of
virginia
who
had
long
dwelt
in
massachusetts
and
who
were
engaged
in
trafficking
with
the
connecticut
settlers
were
suddenly
and
treacherously
attacked
by
a
party
of
pequodees
and
with
their
attendants
barbarously
murdered
and
shortly
afterwards
another
trader
named
oldham
met
the
same
fate
being
assassinated
while
he
was
quietly
sleeping
in
his
boat
by
some
indians
who
had
but
an
hour
before
been
conversing
with
him
in
a
friendly
manner
this
latter
murder
did
not
take
place
actually
among
the
pequodees
but
on
a
small
island
belonging
to
the
narragansetts
called
block
island
but
the
inhabitants
denied
all
knowledge
of
its
perpetration
and
the
murderers
fled
to
the
pequodees
by
whom
they
were
received
and
sheltered
a
strong
suspicion
therefore
lay
on
them
as
being
guilty
of
the
latter
crime
as
well
as
the
former
the
government
of
massachusetts
immediately
resolved
on
punishing
the
offenders
and
a
troop
of
eighty
or
ninety
men
were
sent
off
to
block
island
to
seek
for
the
murderers
the
natives
endeavored
to
oppose
their
landing
but
after
a
short
contest
they
fled
and
hid
themselves
in
the
woods
for
two
days
the
boston
soldiers
remained
on
the
island
burning
and
devastating
the
villages
and
fields
end
firing
at
random
into
the
thickets
but
without
seeing
a
single
being
they
then
broke
up
the
canoes
that
lay
on
the
beach
and
sailed
away
to
the
country
of
the
pequodees
to
insist
on
the
guilty
individuals
being
delivered
to
them
and
on
this
condition
to
offer
peace
but
neither
the
murderers
nor
their
protectors
were
to
be
found
all
had
fled
to
the
forests
and
the
marshes
whither
the
english
could
not
follow
them
and
they
merely
succeeded
in
killing
and
wounding
a
few
stragglers
and
burning
the
huts
that
came
in
their
way
this
fruitless
expedition
rendered
the
pequodees
bolder
than
ever
and
the
neighboring
towns
were
harassed
by
their
nightly
attacks
and
notwithstanding
all
their
precautions
and
the
patrols
that
were
set
on
every
side
the
savages
fell
on
the
whites
whenever
they
were
at
work
in
the
distant
fields
they
slew
the
men
with
their
tomahawks
end
dragged
their
wretched
wives
and
daughters
away
to
captivity
and
thus
in
a
short
time
thirty
of
the
english
settlers
had
become
the
victims
of
their
fury
meanwhile
messengers
were
sent
to
plymouth
and
massachusetts
to
implore
their
aid
and
the
latter
state
promised
two
hundred
soldiers
and
the
former
forty
which
were
as
many
as
its
small
population
could
afford
the
pequodees
dreading
the
power
of
the
english
endeavored
to
move
the
narragansetts
who
had
from
the
most
distant
times
been
their
rivals
and
enemies
to
join
them
in
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
against
the
white
men
whom
they
represented
as
a
common
foe
to
the
indians
and
the
future
destroyers
of
their
race
this
intended
confederation
was
discovered
by
roger
williams
who
spent
much
of
his
time
in
visiting
the
indian
villages
and
instructing
the
natives
with
all
of
whom
he
obtained
a
remarkable
degree
of
influence
this
and
truly
man
immediately
seized
the
opportunity
of
repaying
with
benefits
the
heavy
injuries
that
he
had
received
from
the
massachusetts
and
with
an
admirable
magnanimity
and
self
devotion
he
set
himself
to
prevent
the
dangerous
alliance
the
government
of
massachusetts
were
well
aware
that
williams
was
the
only
man
who
could
effect
this
desirable
object
and
on
hearing
from
him
of
the
schemes
of
sassacus
they
immediately
requested
the
former
victim
of
their
unjust
persecution
to
employ
his
influence
with
the
natives
for
the
benefit
of
his
countrymen
and
well
and
zealously
be
complied
with
this
request
he
left
his
now
comfortable
home
and
all
the
various
employments
that
occupied
his
time
and
travelled
restlessly
from
place
to
place
defying
the
storms
and
the
waves
in
a
miserable
canoe
and
meeting
with
an
undaunted
courage
the
assembled
parties
of
hostile
tribes
whom
he
sought
at
his
own
extreme
peril
to
bring
into
alliance
with
the
english
he
succeeded
in
his
patriotic
object
and
after
along
doubtful
negotiation
he
persuaded
the
narragansetts
to
refuse
the
proffered
coalition
with
the
pequodees
their
young
chief
miantonomo
even
went
a
journey
to
boston
where
he
was
received
with
distinguished
marks
of
honor
and
respect
and
signed
a
treaty
which
allied
him
to
the
settlers
against
his
own
countrymen
the
troops
from
the
assembled
together
and
went
down
the
connecticut
to
attack
the
pequodees
in
their
own
land
their
numbers
were
but
small
not
exceeding
eighty
men
as
each
town
furnished
a
much
weaker
force
than
had
been
promised
but
they
were
joined
by
a
band
of
the
mohicans
a
hardy
race
inhabiting
the
valleys
of
the
connecticut
and
who
had
been
alienated
from
the
pequodees
by
the
oppression
and
arrogance
that
had
excited
the
enmity
of
so
many
other
tribes
the
combined
forces
of
the
english
and
indians
were
placed
under
the
command
of
captain
mason
a
brave
and
intelligent
officer
who
had
served
in
the
netherlands
under
general
fairfax
the
detachment
that
was
expected
from
new
plymouth
was
not
ready
to
march
at
the
time
of
the
troops
taking
the
field
captain
standish
therefore
did
not
set
out
himself
but
he
allowed
such
of
his
soldiers
as
were
ready
to
precede
him
and
take
part
in
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
among
these
rodolph
maitland
who
still
retained
all
the
fire
and
energy
of
his
youth
was
the
foremost
and
he
led
a
little
band
of
brave
companions
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
the
learned
minister
stone
the
friend
and
colleague
of
hooker
accompanied
the
troops
from
boston
for
a
band
of
puritanical
warriors
would
have
thought
themselves
but
badly
provided
for
without
such
spiritual
aid
the
instructions
of
the
government
of
connecticut
directed
mason
to
land
in
the
harbor
of
pequod
and
thus
attack
the
indian
forces
on
their
own
ground
but
he
found
the
natural
strength
of
the
place
so
much
greater
than
he
expected
and
also
observed
that
it
was
so
watchfully
guarded
by
his
enemies
that
he
resolved
to
pass
on
to
the
harbor
in
narragansett
bay
and
after
having
strengthened
his
forces
with
the
warriors
promised
by
miantonomo
to
attack
the
pequodees
from
thence
a
circumstance
occurred
here
that
is
so
characteristic
of
the
time
and
of
the
manners
of
the
puritans
that
it
must
not
be
omitted
the
officers
under
mason
were
dissatisfied
with
this
alteration
in
the
plan
of
the
campaign
and
asserted
that
the
instructions
given
to
the
commander
ought
to
be
literally
followed
it
was
therefore
resolved
to
refer
the
question
to
the
minister
who
was
directed
bring
down
by
prayer
the
responsive
decision
of
the
lord
stone
passed
nearly
the
whole
night
in
prayer
and
supplication
for
wisdom
to
decide
the
matter
and
the
next
morning
declared
to
the
officers
that
the
view
taken
by
their
leader
was
the
right
one
on
which
they
all
submitted
without
a
murmur
footnote
now
newhaven
the
indian
reinforcements
continued
to
increase
miantonomo
brought
two
hundred
warriors
and
other
allied
tribes
joined
them
on
their
march
until
the
number
of
native
auxiliaries
amounted
to
five
hundred
in
these
mason
placed
little
confidence
and
would
gladly
have
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
forty
men
from
plymouth
who
were
already
at
providence
on
their
way
to
join
him
but
his
men
were
eager
to
attack
the
savages
and
the
indians
taunted
him
with
cowardice
for
desiring
to
delay
the
conflict
and
he
was
forced
to
advance
at
once
the
great
strength
of
the
pequodees
consisted
in
two
large
forts
in
one
of
which
the
redoubted
chief
sassacus
himself
commanded
the
other
was
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
mystic
an
inconsiderable
river
that
runs
parallel
to
the
connecticut
these
indian
forts
or
castles
consisted
of
wooden
palisades
thirty
or
forty
feet
high
generally
erected
on
an
elevated
situation
and
enclosing
a
space
sufficiently
large
to
contain
a
considerable
number
of
wigwams
for
the
aged
men
or
whiteheads
and
the
women
and
children
these
two
fortresses
were
the
pride
and
the
confidence
of
the
pequodees
who
believed
them
to
be
invulnerable
as
indeed
they
had
hitherto
found
them
to
the
assaults
of
their
own
countrymen
and
the
other
indian
tribes
appeared
to
hold
them
in
the
same
estimation
for
when
they
found
that
it
was
mason
intention
to
march
directly
to
the
fort
on
the
mystic
their
courage
failed
completely
they
were
only
accustomed
to
the
indian
mode
of
warfare
which
consists
in
secret
attacks
and
cunning
stratagems
and
the
idea
of
braving
the
terrible
pequodees
in
their
strongholds
overpowered
their
resolution
the
very
warriors
who
only
the
day
before
had
boasted
of
their
deeds
now
were
and
cried
out
is
a
god
he
is
invincible
and
they
deserted
in
troops
and
returned
to
their
own
dwellings
thus
the
english
found
themselves
deprived
of
at
least
a
hundred
of
their
narragansett
allies
the
rest
remained
with
them
as
did
also
the
mohicans
but
their
fear
of
the
pequodees
was
so
great
that
mason
could
only
employ
them
as
a
sort
of
meanwhile
these
haughty
indians
were
exulting
in
their
supposed
security
and
indulging
in
songs
and
feasting
they
believed
that
the
english
were
terrified
at
their
strength
and
reputed
numbers
and
had
fled
from
the
intended
place
of
landing
in
pequod
harbor
in
fear
and
had
abandoned
their
enterprise
altogether
they
therefore
amused
themselves
with
fishing
in
the
bay
and
then
inviting
their
allies
to
join
their
revels
they
passed
the
night
in
vaunting
of
their
own
great
actions
and
defying
the
cowardly
whites
we
have
seen
that
their
assuming
arrogance
had
aroused
the
jealousy
and
hatred
of
most
of
the
neighboring
tribes
but
there
were
still
a
few
who
adhered
to
their
cause
and
were
willing
to
unite
with
them
against
the
british
intruders
among
those
none
were
more
powerful
or
more
zealous
than
the
nausetts
that
tribe
which
had
so
greatly
harassed
and
annoyed
the
first
settlers
at
plymouth
and
which
still
retained
the
same
feelings
of
enmity
that
had
then
influenced
them
the
presence
of
henrich
among
that
portion
of
the
tribe
that
was
governed
by
tisquantum
had
indeed
secured
to
himself
the
respect
and
regard
of
almost
the
whole
community
but
it
had
not
weakened
the
strong
prejudice
that
they
as
well
as
the
main
body
of
their
tribe
entertained
against
his
race
or
lessened
their
ardent
desire
to
rid
the
land
of
the
powerful
invaders
sassacus
was
well
acquainted
with
the
sentiments
of
his
nausett
allies
and
he
had
lost
no
time
in
securing
the
of
the
sagamore
of
the
tribe
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
the
british
troops
were
preparing
to
attack
him
and
he
had
also
dispatched
a
swift
messenger
to
meet
tisquantum
and
his
warriors
and
entreat
them
to
use
all
possible
expedition
to
join
him
in
his
own
fortress
and
assist
in
defending
it
against
his
enemies
with
the
present
position
and
intended
movements
of
tisquantum
party
the
pequodee
chief
was
perfectly
conversant
for
there
was
one
in
his
castle
who
was
acquainted
with
the
plans
of
the
nausetts
and
had
only
left
their
councils
when
their
camp
was
pitched
on
the
banks
of
the
great
missouri
this
individual
had
reasons
of
his
own
besides
his
wish
to
strengthen
his
countrymen
against
the
english
for
desiring
the
presence
of
tisquantum
warriors
in
the
approaching
contest
he
hoped
to
place
henrich
in
such
a
position
that
he
would
have
no
alternative
but
either
to
lead
the
nausetts
against
his
own
people
or
to
excite
their
distrust
and
even
hatred
by
refusing
to
do
so
he
expected
and
wished
that
he
should
adopt
the
latter
course
for
he
knew
that
he
had
himself
still
many
secret
adherents
in
the
tribe
who
would
gladly
make
this
an
excuse
for
withdrawing
their
allegiance
from
the
white
sachem
and
bestowing
it
on
him
and
thus
at
length
the
object
of
his
restless
ambition
might
he
attained
and
then
then
revenge
that
burning
passion
of
his
soul
might
quickly
be
also
satiated
it
was
now
many
months
since
coubitant
had
escaped
the
punishment
that
was
due
to
his
many
crimes
and
had
fled
from
the
wrath
of
tisquantum
but
he
had
contrived
to
keep
up
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
movements
of
the
tribe
and
even
an
intercourse
with
his
own
treacherous
partisans
often
indeed
as
the
nausetts
traveled
slowly
across
the
wide
plain
between
the
missouri
and
the
mississippi
that
and
terrible
eye
of
fire
was
fixed
upon
them
from
the
elevated
bough
of
some
thick
tree
or
from
the
overhanging
summit
of
a
neighboring
rock
and
often
at
night
when
the
camp
was
sunk
in
the
silence
of
repose
his
guilty
confederates
crept
forth
to
meet
him
in
some
retired
spot
and
form
plans
for
the
future
in
this
way
coubitant
dodged
the
path
of
the
nausetts
while
they
traversed
the
forests
and
savannas
the
lulls
and
the
valleys
that
led
them
at
length
to
the
great
lake
now
so
well
known
as
lake
superior
here
they
encamped
for
a
considerable
time
in
order
to
construct
a
sufficient
number
of
canoes
to
carry
the
whole
party
across
it
and
also
by
following
the
chain
of
lakes
and
rivers
that
intersects
that
part
of
the
great
continent
and
ends
in
lake
ontario
to
enable
them
to
land
at
no
very
great
distance
from
their
own
native
district
when
the
little
fleet
set
out
on
its
long
and
circuitous
voyage
coubitant
actually
contrived
to
be
one
of
the
passengers
his
partisans
secured
a
canoe
to
themselves
and
pretending
that
some
of
their
arrangements
were
incomplete
they
lingered
on
the
shore
until
the
rest
of
the
boats
were
nearly
out
of
sight
they
then
summoned
their
leader
from
his
place
of
concealment
and
giving
him
a
seat
in
the
canoe
followed
at
their
leisure
thus
he
performed
the
whole
of
the
voyage
and
when
the
tribe
landed
on
the
eastern
shore
of
ontario
and
recommenced
their
wanderings
on
land
he
left
their
route
and
hastened
forward
to
try
and
contrive
some
schemes
that
could
further
his
own
views
the
news
of
the
war
between
the
english
and
his
old
friends
the
pequodees
soon
reached
him
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
he
arrived
in
their
country
and
joined
sassacus
in
his
fortified
village
it
was
he
who
travelled
from
thence
to
the
of
the
nausetts
near
cape
cod
and
secured
their
assistance
in
the
coming
conflict
and
then
returned
in
time
to
send
a
trusty
emissary
to
meet
tisquantum
and
deliver
to
him
a
courteous
message
from
sassacus
this
message
had
the
desired
effect
for
tisquantum
called
a
council
of
his
braves
and
submitted
to
them
the
request
of
their
powerful
ally
that
they
would
fight
with
him
against
the
narragansetts
the
emissary
was
instructed
to
say
nothing
of
the
quarrel
with
the
english
for
coubitant
wished
to
get
henrich
into
the
power
of
the
pequodees
before
he
became
aware
of
the
service
that
was
to
be
required
of
him
and
he
trusted
that
no
intelligence
would
reach
him
in
the
desolate
country
through
which
he
and
his
warriors
would
have
to
march
all
the
assembled
council
were
unanimous
in
their
decision
that
the
request
of
sassacus
should
be
complied
with
and
tisquantum
then
turned
to
henrich
who
sat
beside
him
and
said
son
the
days
are
past
when
i
could
lead
forth
my
warriors
to
the
battle
and
wield
my
tomahawk
with
the
best
and
the
bravest
i
must
sit
in
my
tent
with
the
children
and
the
squaws
and
tell
of
the
deeds
that
i
once
could
perform
while
my
young
braves
are
in
the
field
of

you
must
now

their

and

them
see

though
your

is

you
have
in
your

an
indian
heart

my

replied

shall
be

into

the
battle
even
as
if
your
tekoa
went
before
them

his
glancing
spear
tisquantum
shall
never
have
cause
to
feel
shame
for
the
son
of
his
adoption
know
it
my
brave
henrich
said
the
old
chief
know
that
the
honor
of
tisquantum
race
is
safe
in
your
hands
and
that
you
will
fight
in
defence
of
my
ancient
friends
and
allies
even
as
i
would
have
fought
in
the
days
of
my
young
strength
come
away
now
my
warriors
must
prepare
to
go
with
the
messenger
of
the
great
sassacus
no
time
must
be
lost
in
giving
him
the
aid
he
asks
and
you
my
son
will
be
ready
by
dawn
to
lead
them
on
their
way
i
can
not
go
with
you
for
these
feeble
limbs
are
unfit
to
travel
at
the
speed
with
which
you
must
cross
the
forests
and
the
plains
neither
could
the
women
and
children
bear
it
we
will
follow
the
course
that
we
designed
to
take
and
go
to
the
land
of
my
fathers
in
the
far
east
and
there
we
will
wait
for
our
victorious
as
tisquantum
said
this
he
left
the
hall
of
council
which
consisted
of
a
shadowing
maple
tree
and
led
his
companion
to
the
hut
of
boughs
in
which
oriana
and
mailah
sat
anxiously
awaiting
the
result
of
the
conference
they
did
not
regret
when
they
heard
that
their
husbands
were
to
hasten
to
the
scene
of
war
for
they
were
indian
women
and
could
glory
in
the
deeds
of
their
warriors
but
when
they
were
informed
that
the
main
body
of
the
tribe
was
to
pursue
the
intended
route
towards
paomet
their
grief
and
disappointment
were
very
great
footnote

exclaimed
oriana
i
know
that
you
are
in
the
and
wounded
perhaps
and
wanting
my
aid
and
i
far
away
let
me
go
with
you
you
know
that
oriana
can
bear
danger
and
fatigue
and

and
with
you
there
would
be
no

can
not

replied
henrich
gently
but
decidedly

can
not

we
must
do

and
you
my

could

was

said
no
more
but
she
did
not

assist
him
in
his

for

at
daybreak
on
the
following
morning
he
and
his
warriors
were
ready
to
set
out

said
tisquantum
as
he
grasped
the
hand
of
henrich
have
one
request
i
would
rather
say
command
to
impress
upon
you
before
we
part
let
it
not
be
known
in
the
camp
that
you
are
a
i
know
that
your
good
arm
will
bring
glory
on
yourself
and
those
who
follow
you
and
i
would
have
that
glory
belong
to
my
own
people
among
whom
you
have
learned
to
fight
i
ask
it
also
for
your
own
sake
for
in
the
camp
of
sassacus
there
may
be
some
who
regard
your
race
with
jealousy
and
hatred
and
would
not
bear
to
see
a
excelling
the
red
men
you
may
trust
my
warriors
they
look
on
you
as
they
would
have
done
on
my
tekoa
but
you
may
not
trust
either
our
indian
friends
or
our
indian
foes
henrich
regarded
this
precaution
as
needless
yet
when
oriana
joined
her
entreaties
to
those
of
her
father
he
readily
gave
the
promise
required
his
costume
and
accoutrements
were
strictly
native
and
constant
exposure
to
the
air
and
sun
had
burnt
his
skin
almost
to
a
copper
color
but
his
eyes
were
a
deep
blue
and
his
hair
though
now
dark
had
a
rich
auburn
glow
upon
it
that
differed
greatly
from
the
jet
black
locks
so
universal
among
the
indians
to
hide
this
oriana
gathered
it
up
into
a
knot
on
the
top
of
his
head
in
native
fashion
and
covered
it
with
a
close
black
cap
over
this
his
sachem
coronet
of
feathers
was
placed
and
it
would
have
required
a
very
scrutinising
and
suspicious
eye
to
have
detected
the
disguise
the
blue
eyes
alone
gave
intimation
of
an
european
extraction
and
they
were
so
shaded
by
long
black
lashes
and
had
an
expression
so
deep
and
penetrating
that
few
could
discover
of
what
color
they
were
the
tongue
of
hannah
too
had
learnt
to
speak
the
indian
language
with
a
pure
native
accent
that
no
one
could
acquire
who
had
not
been
brought
up
among
the
red
men
so
that
there
was
little
fear
of
his
being
known
for
a
amid
the
excitement
and
confusion
of
the
war
the
warriors
departed
and
tisquantum
party
resumed
their
journey
though
not
so
joyously
as
before
their
separation
from
those
who
were
going
to
meet
danger
and
perhaps
death
with
unremitting
speed
the
nausett
braves
pursued
their
way
and
reached
the
land
of
the
pequodees
before
the
campaign
had
begun
sassacus
had
as
we
have
seen
taken
up
his
position
in
one
of
his
boasted
forts
and
he
wanted
no
reinforcements
there
for
his
presence
was
regarded
by
his
people
as
a
panoply
of
strength
he
therefore
sent
to
desire
the
nausett
detachment
to
march
to
fort
mystic
and
assist
the
garrison
there
in
defending
it
against
any
attack
that
might

made
chapter
xxiii
god
how
horrible
is
night
there
the
shout
of
battle
the
barbarian
yell
the
bray
of
dissonant
instruments
the
clang
of
arms
the
shriek
of
agony
the
groan
of
death
in
one
wild
uproar
and
continuous
din
shake
the
still
air
while
overhead
the
moon
regardless
of
the
stir
of
this
low
world
holds
on
her
heavenly
madoc
henrich
was
now
called
on
to
perform
the
part
of
an
indian
leader
in
an
indian
camp
it
was
no
new
position
to
him
for
during
his
years
of
wandering
with
the
nansetts
he
had
taken
an
active
part
in
many
of
the
wars
that
were
being
waged
by
the
tribes
among
whom
they
had
sojourned
against
their
hostile
neighbors
he
therefore
was
fully
conversant
with
indian
modes
of
warfare
but
he
was
as
unaccustomed
as
his
followers
were
to
the
defence
of
a
fortress
or
to
a
pitched
battle
between
assembled
forces
in
an
open
field
he
had
not
been
long
at
fort
mystic
ere
he
found
that
he
was
about
to
be
opposed
to
some
of
his
own
countrymen
and
the
information
filled
him
with
grief
and
dismay
it
is
true
he
had
dwelt
so
long
among
the
nausett
indians
and
all
his
personal
interests
were
so
bound
up
with
theirs
that
he
felt
as
if
they
were
indeed
his
kindred
but
still
his
heart
yearned
towards
his
own
people
and
the
friends
of
his
childhood
and
the
idea
of
being
instrumental
in
shedding
the
blood
of
a
briton
was
utterly
repugnant
to
him
it
was
now
however
too
late
to
retract
he
had
pledged
his
word
to
tisquantum
that
he
would
lead
his
warriors
bravely
against
the
foes
of
his
allies
and
honor
forbad
him
to
decline
the
post
of
their
sachem
and
commander
he
therefore
concealed
his
scruples
and
anxieties
in
his
own
breast
and
resolved
to
do
what
he
now
felt
to
be
his
duty
it
was
with
much
satisfaction
that
he
learnt
from
one
of
the
indian
spies
that
the
detachment
of
troops
from
new
plymouth
had
been
unable
to
join
the
forces
of
their
countrymen
for
thus
he
should
be
spared
the
trial
of
being
placed
in
opposition
to
those
with
whom
perhaps
he
had
been
brought
up
in
childhood
towards
the
other
settlers
be
entertained
a
far
less
friendly
feeling
as
reports
of
their
cruel
and
unjust
conduct
towards
the
natives
had
from
time
to
time
reached
him
during
his
residence
in
different
parts
of
the
continent
the
pequodees
and
their
allies
treated
him
with
respect
and
honor
as
the
representative
of
their
ancient
friend
tisquantum
and
if
his
english
blood
was
known
to
any
of
them
they
made
no
remarks
on
the
subject
they
did
not
dare
to
notice
what
such
a
man
as
the
nausett
sachem
appeared
to
be
chose
to
conceal
but
it
is
certain
that
there
was
one
in
the
fortress
of
mystic
whose
keen
eye
had
penetrated
the
disguise
and
to
whom
the
features
of
henrich
were
so
familiar
that
he
could
even
read
his
thoughts
in
his
open
and
ingenuous
countenance
coubitant
was
already
in
the
castle
before
the
nausett
detachment
arrived
and
while
he
dexterously
contrived
to
conceal
himself
from
henrich
he
watched
him
narrowly
and
his
eye
was
on
him
when
he
first
became
aware
that
english
soldiers
were
with
the
foes
with
whom
he
must
contend
then
did
the
savage
exult
in
the
painful
struggle
that
he
could
perceive
the
news
excited
in
his
rival
breast
and
he
hoped
that
the
white
sachem
would
find
some
pretext
for
leaving
the
fort
and
deserting
to
his
own
countrymen
he
kept
spies
continually
watching
his
every
movement
with
orders
to
allow
him
full
liberty
to
escape
but
to
follow
and
secure
him
before
his
purpose
could
be
effected
and
bring
him
in
bonds
to
receive
from
coubitant
own
hand
the
punishment
of
a
coward
and
a
deserter
but
he
waited
in
vain
for
any
such
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
young
sachem
henrich
never
left
the
fortress
and
employed
himself
in
endeavoring
to
keep
his
men
from
sharing
in
the
revelry
and
wild
security
of
their
countrymen
in
this
endeavor
he
had
but
little
success
and
jyanough
alone
remained
with
his
friend
and
took
no
part
in
the
noisy
songs
and
dances
that
followed
the
feast
and
almost
until
midnight
then
a
deep
and
profound
stillness
gradually
succeeded
to
the
barbarous
noises
of
the
wild
festival
and
long
before
the
exhausted
revellers
were
all
buried
in
a
heavy
sleep
even
the
watch
whose
business
it
was
to
patrol
round
the
fort
had
that
night
carelessly
left
their
respective
stations
and
come
inside
the
palisades
to
light
their
pipes
here
they
found
none
awake
but
the
nausett
sachem
and
his
friend
who
were
slowly
walking
among
the
weary
and
sleeping
warriors
attended
only
by
a
large
and
powerful
dog
there
was
another
wakeful
eye
in
the
fortress
and
that
was
even
now
fixed
on
henrich
bat
he
whose
dark
soul
looked
forth
from
that
singular
eye
was
himself
concealed
from
view
and
was
intently
watching
the
object
of
his
hatred
and
hoping
that
he
would
now
attempt
some
act
of
cowardice
or
treachery
henrich
and
jyanough
approached
the
guard
who
had
thus
thoughtlessly
left
their
post
and
desired
them
immediately
to
return
to
their
duty
but
while
the
men
remonstrated
on
the
uselessness
of
so
strictly
keeping
a
watch
now
that
no
present
attack
could
be
expected
they
were
startled
by
the
loud
and
furious
barking
of
rodolph
who
had
wandered
to
the
open
gate
and
thus
gave
ominous
warning
of
approaching
danger
the
terrified
guard
now
reached
to
the
gate
accompanied
by
henrich
and
jyanough
when
to
their
dismay
they
beheld
in
the
faint
moonlight
a
large
body
of
men
approaching
close
to
the
fort
they
easily
discerned
that
the
foremost
of
the
troop
were
europeans
and
they
raised
a
loud
cry
of
owannux
englishmen
englishmen
which
quickly
aroused
the
sleepers
and
brought
them
towards
the
gate
in
the
next
minute
the
fort
was
thickly
hemmed
in
by
the
british
force
and
a
second
dense
ring
was
formed
beyond
them
by
their
indian
allies
the
main
entrance
was
soon
forced
by
the
swords
and
muskets
of
the
vigorous
assailants
and
though
the
pequodees
fought
with
all
the
fury
of
despair
they
were
driven
back
and
compelled
to
retreat
towards
the
wigwams
they
were
closely
pursued
by
their
foes
and
at
length
threw
themselves
into
the
huts
which
contained
the
terrified
women
and
children
and
resolved
to
defend
them
to
the
last
gasp
while
the
murderous
strife
continued
the
light
of
day
began
to
dawn
and
soon
the
full
glow
of
the
rising
sun
revealed
the
work
that
had
been
done
in
darkness
the
ground
was
strewed
with
dead
and
dying
indians
but
the
band
of
english
warriors
was
yet
unbroken
and
was
fiercely
bearing
onward
towards
the
wigwams
their
numbers
were
small
indeed
when
compared
with
those
of
their
opponents
but
the
latter
had
no
firearms
and
a
panic
seemed
to
have
struck
them
from
the
force
and
suddenness
of
the
attack
still
they
defended
the
lines
of
wigwams
with
desperation
until
mason
with
amazing
boldness
entered
one
of
them
and
seizing
a
brand
from
the
hearth
set
fire
to
the
roof
of
reeds
an
indian
warrior
was
in
the
act
of
levelling
his
arrow
at
him
when
an
english
officer
sprang
forward
and
cut
the
string
of
the
bent
bow
with
his
sword
this
officer
caught
the
eye
of
henrich
and
though
he
knew
not
why
riveted
it
by
a
strange
and
unaccountable
attraction
he
was
a
looking
man
and
though
his
dark
hair
was
slightly
tinged
with
grey
his
muscular
limbs
had
apparently
lost
none
of
their
force
and
his
spirit
none
of
its
courage
and
energy
so
fixedly
was
the
attention
of
henrich
fastened
on
the
gallant
soldier
that
for
a
time
he
was
regardless
of
the
battle
that
raged
around
him
and
of
the
fearful
conflagration
that
was
spreading
along
the
indian
huts
these
were
only
composed
of
weed
and
dry
moss
and
reeds
and
the
flames
quickly
caught
hold
of
them
and
promised
soon
to
bring
the
conflict
to
a
dreadful
close
the
eye
of
henrich
was
still
fixed
on
that
noble
english
officer
and
the
instinctive
feeling
of
admiration
and
respect
with
which
his
aspect
inspired
him
was
increased
by
seeing
him
regardless
of
his
own
safety
actively
engaged
in
rescuing
an
indian
woman
and
her
child
from
a
mass
of
burning
ruins
he
had
been
observed
by
other
eyes
also
by
eyes
that
recognised
him
and
glared
with
irrepressible
fury
as
they
fell
on
him
an
indian
warrior
approached
him
from
behind
while
he
was
unguardedly
pursuing
his
work
of
mercy
and
henrich
saw
the
savage
preparing
to
strike
a
deadly
blow
that
would
have
cleft
the
head
of
the
stranger
in
twain
could
he
stand
and
see
the
noble
briton
thus
fall
by
a
secret
and
unresisted
attack
no
every
feeling
and
every
instinct
of
his
heart
forbad
it
one
instant
his
tomahawk
flew
in
a
gleaming
circle
round
his
head
and
the
next
it
fell
with
crushing
force
on
the
right
shoulder
of
the
savage
and
sank
deeply
into
his
chest
it
was
a
timely
blow
and
saved
the
white
man
life
but
it
could
not
save
him
from
a
severe
wound
in
the
back
where
the
axe
of
the
indian
fell
heavily
as
his
arm
dropped
powerlessly
by
his
side
never
to
be
raised
again
coubitant
sank
on
the
ground
and
as
he
turned
to
look
on
his
unexpected
assailant
his
eyes
met
those
of
henrich
and
glared
fiercely
first
at
him
and
then
at
his
intended
victim
whose
life
had
been
so
strangely
preserved
they
stood
side
by
side
unconscious
of
the
tie
that
bound
them
so
closely
together
coubitant
knew
it
well
and
he
felt
in
this
awful
moment
that
mahneto
had
in
righteous
retribution
sent
the
son
to
preserve
the
father
life
from
the
hand
of
him
who
had
hated
both
alike
he
hated
them
still
and
even
with
his
dying
breath
he
would
not
reveal
the
secret
that
would
have
united
those
seemingly
hostile
warriors
in
the
embrace
of
deep
affection
rodolph
had
not
seen
the
friend
whose
timely
aid
had
partially
averted
the
deadly
blow
that
had
been
aimed
at
him
by
the
savage
but
on
turning
round
he
was
astonished
to
perceive
that
his
foe
and
his
avenger
were
apparently
of
the
same
party
the
latter
whose
countenance
expressed
the
deepest
indignation
and
who
was
raising
his
bloody
hatchet
from
the
prostrate
form
of
the
wounded
indian
was
evidently
not
one
of
the
allies
of
the
english
and
his
dress
and
ornaments
and
air
of
dignified
command
indicated
him
to
be
a
chief
among
his
own
people
why
then
had
he
come
to
the
aid
of
an
enemy
rodolph
gazed
inquiringly
at
the
fine
countenance
of
the
young
sachem
which
was
now
bent
upon
the
dying
indian
at
his
feet
he
exclaimed
in
the
nausett
tongue
it
indeed
you
whom
i
have
thus
slain
unknowingly
you
have
been
a
bitter
and
an
untiring
enemy
to
me
but
it
was
not
for
this
that
i
smote
thee
to
the
earth
i
knew
you
not
but
i
saw
you
aim
a
cowardly
blow
at
the
white
chief
and
i
saved
him
i
forgive
you
now
for
all
your
hatred
and
all
your
evil
designs
which
mahneto
has
thus
recompensed
upon
your
own
head
ask
not
your
forgiveness
replied
the
savage
in
a
deep
struggling
voice
for
the
hand
of
death
was
on
him
and
the
dark
fire
of
his
eye
was
waning
out
death
i
hate
and
defy
you
and
in
death
i
enjoy
a
revenge
that
you
know
not
of
he
strove
to
raise
his
hand
in
menace
but
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
with
a
groan
of
suppressed
agony
he
expired
the
fight
was
raging
with
unabated
violence
and
the
conflagration
had
already
spread
to
the
farthest
end
of
the
fortress
henrich
looked
around
for
his
comrades
who
were
bravely
contending
with
their
powerful
foes
at
some
distance
and
he
hastily
prepared
to
join
them
but
as
he
turned
away
he
courteously
waved
his
hand
to
rodolph
and
said
in
the
english
language
but
with
an
indian
accent
brave
englishman
rodolph
started
that
voice
had
thrilled
through
his
heart
when
it
had
spoken
a
strange
language
but
now
it
struck
upon
him
with
a
sense
of
familiarity
that
be
could
not
account
for
as
the
indian
chief
was
evidently
an
utter
stranger
to
him
he
returned
his
parting
salutation
and
but
still
he
watched
his
retreating
form
and
thought
he
distinctly
heard
him
utter
the
name
as
a
large
dog
which
had
stood
near
him
during
their
brief
encounter
bounded
after
him
over
foe
heaps
of
slain
and
dying
it
was
my
own
fancy
that
conjured
up
that
name
thought
rodolph
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
compelled
again
to
join
the
conflict
and
at
the
head
of
his
little
band
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
fortress
which
was
rapidly
becoming
a
prey
to
the
devouring
flames
all
the
english
withdrew
outside
the
palisades
and
thickly
surrounded
the
fort
while
their
indian
allies
who
had
hitherto
kept
aloof
now
took
courage
to
approach
and
form
a
second
circle
outside
the
most
furious
despair
now
took
possession
of
the
souls
of
the
devoted
pequodees
and
their
terrible
was
heard
resounding
high
and
mingled
with
the
agonising
yells
of
the
women
and
children
and
helpless
aged
men
who
were
expiring
amid
the
flames
many
of
the
warriors
climbed
the
palisades
and
leaped
down
among
their
foes
hoping
to
escape
but
they
were
quickly
despatched
by
the
muskets
and
bayonets
of
the
english
or
if
any
had
power
to
break
through
the
first
hostile
line
they
fell
beneath
the
of
the
mohicans
rodolph
had
received
a
considerable
wound
but
it
had
not
entirely
disabled
him
at
the
head
of
his
men
he
passed
through
the
open
gate
of
the
fortress
and
attempted
still
to
lead
and
command
them
he
found
however
that
his
strength
was
failing
and
that
he
could
no
longer
wield
his
good
broad
sword
he
therefore
stood
leaning
on
it
and
watching
with
mingled
feelings
of
pity
and
horror
the
progress
of
the
work
of
destruction
presently
he
saw
a
side
entrance
to
the
fort
thrown
suddenly
open
and
the
form
of
the
indian
chief
whose
tomahawk
had
saved
his
life
and
whose
voice
had
awakened
such
strange
feelings
appeared
rushing
forth
he
was
attended
by
another
striking
looking
warrior
and
followed
by
a
band
of
determined
natives
who
were
resolved
to
escape
or
sell
their
lives
dearly
rodolph
men
who
occupied
the
position
opposite
to
that
gate
raised
their
muskets
to
fire
on
these
brave
men
but
their
commander
loudly
and
authoritatively
bade
them
desist
i
command
you
he
exclaimed
that
noble
chieftain
escape
and
all
his
attendants
for
his
sake
he
saved
my
life
in
the
fort
and
death
to
the
man
who
injures
him
he
attempted
to
rush
forward
to
enforce
his
orders
but
pain
and
loss
of
blond
prevented
him
from
moving
and
he
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
support
of
one
of
his
comrades
meanwhile
henrich
and
jyanough
and
their
band
of
nausetts
had
rushed
through
the
unopposing
ranks
of
the
english
and
were
now
contending
desperately
with
the
indian
line
beyond
the
british
troops
paused
and
looked
after
them
and
the
sympathy
that
brave
men
feel
for
each
other
prevented
any
of
them
from
attempting
to
pursue
or
molest
them
on
the
contrary
all
now
wished
them
success
with
breathless
anxiety
rodolph
gazed
after
them
and
watched
the
towering
plumes
that
adorned
the
noble
head
of
the
sachem
as
he
bore
onward
through
the
opposing
crowd
of
indians
he
passed
and
gained
the
plain
beyond
attended
by
his
followers
and
from
the
elevated
position
at
which
the
fort
was
erected
rodolph
could
still
watch
the
little
band
retiring
until
the
indian
heroes
were
hidden
from
view
by
a
thicket
so
fiercely
had
the
fire
seconded
the
efforts
of
the
english
that
the
whole
conflict
only
lasted
one
hour
in
that
brief
space
of
time
between
five
and
six
hundred
indians
young
and
old
men
and
women
were
destroyed
by
fire
and
sword
and
the
small
remainder
were
made
prisoners
of
war
by
the
english
or
carried
off
as
prizes
by
the
hostile
natives
only
two
of
the
british
soldiers
were
slain
but
many
were
wounded
and
the
arrows
remaining
some
time
in
the
wounds
and
the
want
of
necessary
medicine
and
refreshment
added
greatly
to
their
sufferings
the
medical
attendants
attached
to
the
expedition
and
the
provisions
had
all
been
left
in
the
boats
and
a
march
of
more
than
six
miles
through
their
enemies
land
was
necessary
in
order
to
reach
them
litters
were
therefore
constructed
and
in
these
the
wounded
were
sent
off
under
the
charge
of
the
mohicans
while
the
men
whose
number
was
reduced
to
little
more
than
forty
prepared
to
follow
as
a
the
whole
party
were
still
near
the
smoking
ruins
of
the
fort
when
they
were
startled
by
perceiving
a
large
body
of
armed
natives
approaching
these
were
a
band
of
more
than
three
hundred
pequodees
sent
by
sassacus
to
aid
the
garrison
of
fort
mystic
happily
they
did
not
discover
the
small
number
of
the
english
who
were
in
a
condition
to
oppose
them
and
they
turned
aside
and
avoided
a
the
white
men
took
advantage
of
this
mistake
on
the
part
of
their
enemies
and
hastened
forward
with
all
the
speed
that
circumstances
would
allow
but
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
their
ears
were
assailed
by
the
most
discordant
yells
from
the
pequodees
they
had
reached
the
scene
of
devastation
and
when
they
beheld
the
ruined
fort
and
the
ground
strewn
with
hundreds
of
mangled
corpses
and
expiring
friends
their
fury
knew
no
bounds
they
stamped
and
howled
with
rage
and
grief
and
madly
tore
their
hair
while
they
gave
vent
to
their
excited
feelings
in
that
fearful
and
peculiar
yell
at
the
sound
of
which
the
stoutest
hearts
might
quail
then
with
a
wild
and
desperate
effort
at
revenge
they
rushed
down
the
bill
in
pursuit
of
their
cruel
enemies
the
guard
turned
and
met
the
onset
bravely
the
savages
were
received
with
a
shower
of
bullets
which
checked
their
furious
assault
but
they
hung
on
the
rear
of
the
english
and
harassed
them
during
the
whole
of
their
retreat
they
however
reached
their
vessels
in
safety
and
arrived
in
triumph
at
hartford
from
which
port
they
had
sailed
three
weeks
before
this
discomfiture
proved
a
to
the
pride
and
power
of
the
redoubted
sassacus
disgusted
alike
by
his
arrogance
and
by
his
recent
defeat
many
of
his
own
warriors
deserted
him
and
attached
themselves
to
other
tribes
and
the
sachem
then
destroyed
his
second
fortress
end
carried
off
his
treasure
to
the
land
of
the
mohawks
near
the
river
hudson
and
with
his
principal
chiefs
joined
that
warlike
race
meanwhile
the
remainder
of
the
troops
from
massachusetts
whom
the
government
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
send
with
captain
mason
had
landed
at
saybroke
led
by
captain
houghton
and
attended
by
wilson
as
their
spiritual
guide
they
arrived
just
in
time
to
hear
of
the
successful
issue
of
the
campaign
and
had
therefore
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
except
to
join
a
small
band
from
connecticut
and
keep
down
or
destroy
the
few
pequodees
or
other
hostile
indians
who
still
lurked
about
the
district
and
kept
the
settlers
in
fear
and
anxiety
these
wretched
natives
were
chased
into
their
most
secret
haunts
where
they
were
barbarously
slain
their
wigwams
were
burnt
and
their
fields
desolated
nor
were
the
english
the
only
foes
of
the
once
terrible
pequodees
their
indian
rivals
took
advantage
of
their
present
weak
and
scattered
condition
to
wreak
upon
them
the
suppressed
vengeance
of
bygone
years
and
pursued
with
ruthless
cruelty
those
whose
very
name
had
once
inspired
them
with
awe
and
dread
and
yet
with
shame
be
it
said
the
leader
of
the
troops
of
massachusetts
himself
a
member
of
the
strict
and
exclusive
church
of
boston
surpassed
these
savages
in
cruelty
on
one
occasion
he
made
prisoners
of
nearly
a
hundred
pequodees
of
these
miserable
creatures
he
sent
the
wives
and
children
into
servitude
at
boston
while
he
caused
the
men
in
number
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
and
carried
in
a
shallop
outside
the
harbor
where
they
wore
thrown
overboard
if
this
barbarous
deed
was
not
committed
by
the
directions
of
the
fathers
of
massachusetts
yet
they
certainly
neither
disclaimed
nor
censured
it
indeed
so
little
were
cruelty
and
oppression
when
exercised
against
the
red
men
regarded
as
crimes
by
many
of
the
settlers
that
one
of
their
learned
divines
even
of
the
age
succeeding
the
perpetrations
of
the
above
appalling
event
expressed
it
as
his
opinion
that
had
smiled
on
the
english
and
added
with
horrible
and
disgusting
levity
it
was
found
to
be
the
quickest
way
the
with
the
multitude
of
indian
captives
the
other
tribes
who
had
joined
the
pequodees
in
opposing
the
conquering
white
men
were
pardoned
on
their
submission
but
that
devoted
race
who
fought
like
heroes
to
the
very
last
were
extirpated
as
a
nation
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
very
name
in
which
they
had
so
long
gloried
and
which
had
been
a
terror
to
all
the
neighboring
tribes
was
not
permitted
to
remain
and
to
tell
where
once
they
had
dwelt
and
reigned
unrivalled
the

had
been
called

the
appellation
of

boys
who
were
taken
captive
from
tune
to
time
by
the
british
troops
were
sold
and
carried
as
slaves
to
bermuda
and
others
were
divided
among
the
settlers
and
condemned
not
to
slavery
for
that
was
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
new
england
but
to
servitude
which
must
indeed
have
been
much
the
same
thing
to
indian
spirits
accustomed
to
the
wild
liberty
of
the
forests
and
the
prairies
sassacus
the
once
mighty
chief
of
this
mighty
and
heroic
people
was
basely
slain
by
the
mohawks
among
whom
he
had
sought
fellowship
and
protection
for
the
sake
of
the
treasures
that
be
had
brought
with
him
from
his
own
lost
dominions
and
his
heart
was
sent
by
his
murderers
as
a
to
the
government
of
connecticut
thus
ended
the
war
which
had
been
commenced
as
a
necessary
measure
of
and
in
which
the
pious
and
roger
williams
had
at
first
taken
so
active
and
influential
a
part
the
manner
in
which
it
was
carried
out
and
the
cruelty
that
marked
so
many
of
its
details
were
repulsive
in
the
highest
degree
to
his
just
and
benevolent
spirit
but
where
mercy
was
concerned
his
opinion
and
advice
had
no
influence
with
the
stern
men
of
boston
the
only
act
which
met
with
his
approbation
in
the
conclusion
of
the
campaign
was
the
assignment
of
the
depopulated
lands
of
the
pequodees
to
uncas
the
chief
of
the
mohicans
as
being
a
conquered
territory
the
usual
laws
of
war
would
have
annexed
it
to
the
territory
of
the
victors
but
in
this
case
the
settlers
adhered
to
their
original
principle
of
only
obtaining
by
purchase
from
the
natives
those
tracts
of
land
on
which
they
desired
to
settle
and
a
great
part
of
that
which
was
now
bestowed
on
uncas
was
afterwards
bought
back
from
him
and
his
inferior
sachems
or
obtained
by
friendly
contract
until
the
english
became
possessors
of
the
whole
district
at
a
subsequent
period
the
pequodees
who
had
escaped
from
their
desolated
land
and
joined
other
tribes
assembled
themselves
together
and
made
one
final
effort
at
establishing
their
independence
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
but
their
power
and
prosperity
were
broken
for
ever
captain
mason
was
again
sent
to
subdue
this
remnant
of
the
tribe
and
the
destruction
that
was
accomplished
on
these
unhappy
exiles
spread
a
fear
of
the
white
men
through
all
the
indian
race
in
that
part
of
the
continent
from
that
time
the
settlers
of
connecticut
who
had
been
the
original
cause
of
this
cruel
war
enjoyed
an
unbroken
peace
and
security
for
forty
years

voices
of

i

still
they
have
been
with
me
through
the
stormy
night
the

voices
wont
to
fill
my
clear
depths
with
unalloyed
delight
i

them
still

though
some
from

are

and
the
tones

wild
silvery
tones
that
rang
through

more

have
died
in
others
yet
to
me
they
come
singing
of
boyhood
back
the
voices
of
my
home
hemans
one
sabbath
evening
a
few
months
after
the
events
related
in
the
last
chapter
and
when
the
short
second
indian
summer
that
so
often
returns
late
in
the
month
of
september
was
at
its
height
the
inhabitants
of
new
plymouth
were
assembled
at
their
on
burying
hill
and
engaged
at
their
usual
devotions
none
were
left
in
their
dwellings
except
those
whom
age
or
sickness
prevented
from
joining
the
rest
of
the
congregation
or
those
who
were
necessarily
detained
by
the
care
of
young
children
the
habitation
of
rodolph
maitland
was
therefore
deserted
by
all
but
janet
who
would
gladly
have
gone
that
evening
to
listen
to
the
husband
of
her
young
mistress
for
roger
williams
was
to
lead
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
and
to
deliver
to
them
the
customary
address
but
little
girl
demanded
her
care
and
old
janet
took
too
much
pride
and
pleasure
in
the
interesting
child
to
repine
at
having
the
charge
of
her
even
though
it
prevented
her
from
attending
at
the
on
the
first
occasion
of
roger
officiating
there
since
his
marriage
little
edith
was
just
beginning
to
walk
alone
and
it
was
her
delight
to
play
in
the
bright
sunny
garden
and
pluck
the
gay
flowers
that
still
bloomed
there
in
profusion
she
was
thus
engaged
and
murmuring
a
sweet
but
inarticulate
song
that
her
mother
had
attempted
to
teach
her
when
janet
apprehending
no
danger
returned
for
a
moment
to
the
house
to
perform
some
domestic
duty
just
then
a
stranger
followed
by
a
large
dog
entered
the
garden
by
the
wicket
gate
that
led
towards
the
forest
and
stood
silently
gazing
around
him
without
at
first
observing
the
happy
and
occupied
child
he
was
tall
and
of
a
commanding
appearance
and
his
costume
which
was
richly
ornamented
in
the
indian
fashion
bespoke
him
to
be
a
native
of
high
rank
but
had
any
one
closely
examined
his
countenance
they
would
have
discovered
beneath
those
long
dark
lashes
and
clearly
marked
eyebrows
the
deep
blue
eye
of
the
saxon
race
which
was
also
indicated
by
the
rich
brown
hair
that
now
unconcealed
waved
across
his
manly
forehead
a
keen
eye
would
also
have
detected
on
the
features
of
that
seeming
indian
sachem
an
expression
of
deep
thought
and
strong
emotion
that
told
of
old
remembrances
not
yet
obliterated
and
of
feelings
that
belonged
to
home
and
kindred
yes
henrich
was
indeed
absorbed
in
those
recollections
that
were
revived
in
his
breast
by
the
sight
of
objects
once
so
familiar
but
which
many
years
had
elapsed
since
last
he
had
looked
on
much
was
changed
but
much
was
still
the
same
the
rude
hut
commodious
that
once
stood
on
that
site
was
now
replaced
by
a
substantial
and
picturesque
dwelling
in
the
elizabethan
style
of
architecture
whose
deep
bay
windows
were
hung
with
the
sweet
single
roses
that
were
natives
of
the
woods
and
other
flowering
plants
while
wreaths
of
the
virginian
creeper
now
glowing
in
its
scarlet
hue
of
autumn
climbed
to
the
summit
of
the
carved
gables
and
pinnacles
that
ornamented
the
building
and
hung
from
thence
in
rich
festoons
on
the
front
of
this
dwelling
the
evening
sun
fell
brightly
and
its
slanting
beams
likewise
partially
illuminated
the
garden
with
long
streaks
of
light
while
other
parts
were
thrown
into
strong
shadow
by
the
trees
and
shrubs
that
grew
among
the
one
of
these
a
noble
rose
in
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
and
stretched
its
giant
arms
wide
on
every
side
on
this
tree
the
eyes
of
the
wanderer
rested
long
and
then
he
approached
it
and
stood
looking
wistfully
towards
a
bower
that
was
situated
near
the
old
tree
and
over
which
the
creepers
fell
in
wild
luxuriance
was
it
a
tear
that
glittered
in
that
warlike
stranger
eye
as
a
ray
from
the
western
sun
fell
on
his
face
through
the
thick
overhanging
foliage
and
did
those
manly
limbs
tremble
as
he
clasped
his
hands
over
his
face
and
sank
on
the
rustic
seat
beneath
the
can
not
enter
the
house
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
can
not
seek
those
loved
ones
there
where
once
we
dwelt
in
happiness
together
and
where
perhaps
none
now
remain
to
welcome
the
wanderer
home
o
that
some
one
would
appear
who
might
tell
me
of
their
fate
henrich
spoke
to
himself
in
his
native
tongue
he
could
not
speak
a
strange
language
in
that
old
familiar
spot
and
his
voice
attracted
the
notice
of
the
little
girl
who
was
now
slowly
moving
towards
him
her
hands
filled
with
the
spoils
of
the
she
stopped
and
gazed
at
the
stranger
and
then
uttered
a
faint
cry
of
fear
that
at
once
roused
henrich
from
his
reverie
his
eyes
fell
on
the
lovely
child
and
instantly
his
memory
recalled
the
features
and
expression
of
his
brother
ludovico
to
whom
the
little
edith
bore
a
strong
resemblance
with
an
irresistible
impulse
he
sprang
forward
and
caught
the
little
girl
in
his
arms
and
sought
by
caresses
to
soothe
her
fears
and
hush
her
cries
of
terror
but
those
cries
had
caught
the
watchful
ear
of
janet
and
with
all
the
speed
that
she
could
use
she
came
running
from
the
house
merely
anticipating
that
her
charge
had
fallen
down
or
was
alarmed
at
finding
herself
alone
what
was
then
her
terror
and
amazement
at
seeing
her
in
the
arms
of
an
indian
one
instant
she
stood
rivetted
to
the
spot
not
knowing
how
to
act
the
next
she
turned
and
again
hurried
in
to
the
house
from
whence
she
escaped
by
a
back
door
and
sped
breathlessly
towards
burying
hill
she
knew
that
the
service
was
over
for
the
last
strains
of
the
parting
hymn
had
been
borne
down
by
the
evening
breeze
as
she
left
the
house
and
therefore
she
would
find
help
and
succor
from
the
returning
congregation
that
deep
melodious
sound
had
been
heard
by
henrich
also
and
it
had
struck
a
chord
in
his
heart
that
vibrated
almost
to
agony
the
stillness
and
abstraction
of
his
look
as
he
listened
to
the
dying
cadence
silenced
the
cries
of
the
little
child
she
gazed
into
his
upturned
eyes
and
possibly
she
felt
that
those
eyes
had
an
expression
that
was
neither
strange
nor
terrible
for
now
she
suffered
the
stranger
to
seat
himself
again
on
the
bench
beneath
the
tulip
tree
and
place
her
gently
on
his
knee
such
was
the
picture
that
met
the
eyes
of
edith
and
her
husband
and
parents
as
they
rushed
into
the
garden
followed
by
the
trembling
and
exhausted
janet
child
my
edith
shrieked
the
young
mother
and
sprang
towards
the
tree
that
name
told
a
long
history
to
the
wanderer
which
his
heart
had
already
guessed
the
indian
warrior
rose
but
he
did
not
fly
no
he
only
met
the
terrified
mother
and
as
he
placed
her
child
in
her
trembling
arms
he
folded
them
both
in
his
own
in
amazement
and
indignation
at
this
rude
action
roger
now
caught
his
arm
and
in
the
indian
tongue
inquired
hastily
are
you
and
what
can
cause
this
freedom
i
am
henrich
maitland
exclaimed
the
stranger
the
lord
has
brought
me
back
to
my
home
once
more
oh
the
music
the
thrilling
startling
music
of
those
words
to
the
ears
and
hearts
of
those
who
bad
so
long
believed
him
dead
the
surprise
and
joy
were
too
intense
for
helen
and
she
sank
fainting
into
the
arms
of
her
son
while
rodolph
grasped
his
hand
and
exclaimed
with
deep
emotion
god
be
praised
my
brave
my
blessed
son
surely
his
mercies
are
infinite
and
his
ways
past
finding
out
now
i
know
why
my
heart
yearned
so
strangely
towards
the
indian
chief
who
saved
my
life
in
the
fort
of
mystic
and
why
his
voice
had
such
a
thrilling
and
familiar
tone
that
spoke
of
home
and
bygone
years
look
on
me
my
henrich
and
say
do
you
not
recognise
the
english
soldier
whom
your
generous
interference
preserved
from
a
dreadful
death
the
change
in
rodolph
dress
and
his
own
overpowering
emotions
had
hitherto
prevented
henrich
from
discovering
that
in
the
man
whom
he
was
proud
to
call
his
father
he
also
beheld
that
gallant
british
officer
whose
appearance
had
so
powerfully
attracted
him
in
the
conflict
of
fort
mystic
but
when
he
looked
into
that
fine
countenance
he
well
remembered
every
feature
and
he
wondered
why
he
had
not
known
him
even
when
they
met
so
unexpectedly
in
the
excitement
of
the
battle
that
was
a
happy
hour
and
in
the
joy
of
meeting
so
many
that
he
loved
henrich
for
awhile
forgot
that
any
one
was
missing
but
soon
be
looked
around
as
if
seeking
some
familiar
object
which
did
not
meet
his
eye
he
feared
to
ask
for
ludovico
but
his
father
saw
the
inquiring
look
and
guessed
its
import
is
gone
he
said
gently
brother
did
not
remain
with
us
long
after
you
had
left
us
and
his
young
spirit
is
now
where
we
believed
that
yours
had
long
been
dwelling
in
peace
he
would
have
rejoiced
to
see
this
day
dear
henrich
for
he
as
well
as
edith
mourned
your
loss
sincerely
but
he
is
happy
now
and
we
will
not
regret
him
the
lord
has
restored
to
us
one
of
our
sons
in
a
manner
so
strange
and
under
such
extraordinary
circumstances
that
we
can
hardly
realise
the
blessing
tell
us
henrich
how
this
has
been
brought
about
the
violent
agitation
occasioned
by
such
a
meeting
had
now
somewhat
subsided
and
the
wanderer
could
calmly
relate
the
story
of
his
adventures
while
his
mother
and
sister
sat
on
each
side
of
him
gazing
fondly
at
his
but
still
familiar
countenance
and
the
scarcely
less
interested
janet
seated
herself
on
the
turf
with
little
edith
on
her
knees
rodolph
and
roger
williams
also
reclined
on
the
ground
and
all
were
impatient
for
the
narrative
group
is
not
complete
said
henrich
hither
rodolph
and
then
addressing
his
dog
in
the
indian
language
he
made
him
lie
down
at
his
feet
my
ears
did
not
deceive
me
exclaimed
maitland
you
left
me
henrich
in
the
midst
of
that
fearful
fray
i
thought
i
heard
you
pronounce
my
name
and
the
sound
startled
me
strangely
have
you
then
called
your
unconscious
companion
by
your
father
name
and
in
all
your
wanderings
and
your
trials
and
temptations
has
that
name
been
dear
to
you
only
knows
dear
replied
the
sachem
remembrance
of
my
parents
and
all
they
taught
me
in
my
childhood
has
been
not
only
my
joy
and
consolation
but
my
safeguard
also
you
will
find
me
very
unlearned
and
ignorant
in
all
worldly
knowledge
for
i
have
had
no
means
of
keeping
up
the
little
i
had
acquired
but
god
be
praised
i
have
been
kept
from
forgetting
him
and
the
saviour
in
whom
you
taught
me
to
put
my
trust
nor
have
i
been
quite
alone
in
my
faith
one
there
is
of
whom
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
you
in
the
course
of
my
history
who
has
been
and
is
my
spiritual
companion
and
support
i
have
had
many
blessings
truly
is
it
declared
not
by
might
nor
by
power
but
by
my
spirit
saith
the
lord
exclaimed
helen
as
she
raised
her
eyes
in
grateful
gratitude
to
heaven
now
she
and
rodolph
felt
that
they
had
recovered
their
lost
son
not
for
time
alone
but
for
eternity
henrich
long
and
adventurous
story
was
told
and
so
many
were
the
questions
and
the
comments
that
it
called
forth
that
long
are
it
was
finished
the
light
of
day
had
all
departed
and
been
replaced
by
the
softer
rays
of
the
unclouded
moon
it
was
with
mingled
feelings
of
disappointment
and
of
gratitude
that
henrich
friends
heard
of
his
marriage
with
an
indian
female
but
as
he
described
her
character
and
spoke
of
her
sincere
and
humble
faith
and
of
all
that
she
had
been
to
him
since
the
first
day
of
his
captivity
they
became
more
than
reconciled
to
the
alliance
and
thanked
god
who
had
so
mercifully
provided
their
son
with
such
a
friend
and
companion
to
cheer
his
otherwise
lonely
life
they
and
edith
also
felt
impatient
to
become
acquainted
with
this
new
relative
whom
they
were
already
prepared
to
love
and
as
she
was
now
dwelling
near
cape
cod
with
her
father
and
the
rest
of
her
tribe
they
hoped
to
do
so
before
the
winter
set
in
henrich
promised
that
this
hope
should
be
compiled
with
but
it
was
a
source
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
to
his
family
when
they
heard
that
he
was
pledged
to
the
aged
tisquantum
never
to
take
his
only
and
beloved
child
from
him
as
long
as
he
lived
he
could
not
therefore
at
present
change
his
mode
of
life
or
take
up
his
abode
at
new
plymouth
but
must
return
to
dwell
with
his
indian
friends
and
fill
the
place
of
tisquantum
son
and
representative
until
the
old
man
should
be
gathered
to
his
fathers
the
days
that
henrich
passed
in
the
home
of
his
childhood
flew
rapidly
away
all
his
old
friends
gathered
around
him
to
welcome
him
on
his
unexpected
return
and
to
offer
their
congratulations
to
his
happy
parents
and
sister
the
joy
of
the
venerable
brewster
at
again
beholding
his
young
friend
and
pupil
and
at
finding
him
still
a
sincere
and
intelligent
christian
was
very
great
and
even
among
those
who
had
never
known
him
his
adventurous
story
and
his
frank
and
engaging
manners
excited
the
deepest
interest
between
himself
and
his
roger
williams
a
strong
and
lasting
friendship
was
established
and
when
the
time
arrived
for
henrich
to
return
to
paomet
roger
proposed
to
accompany
him
and
assist
in
escorting
his
wife
and
child
to
pay
their
promised
visit
to
new
plymouth
this
offer
was
gladly
accepted
and
the
english
minister
and
the
indian
chief
set
out
on
foot
the
journey
was
comparatively
easy
to
men
who
had
long
been
accustomed
to
such
toils
and
difficulties
as
both
henrich
and
roger
had
for
years
been
inured
to
and
they
reached
paomet
very
quickly
but
sorrow
met
them
there
the
first
sound
that
fell
on
their
ears
as
they
approached
the
village
was
the
indian
dirge
for
a
departing
soul
henrich
listened
for
a
moment
to
catch
the
exact
direction
from
whence
the
ominous
sound
proceeded
and
then
darted
forward
with
such
velocity
that
roger
active
as
he
was
could
with
difficulty
follow
him
henrich
hastened
towards
a
large
dwelling
at
the
upper
end
of
the
village
and
entering
the
low
door
he
beheld
a
sight
which
though
it
filled
his
heart
with
unaffected
grief
was
yet
in
some
sense
a
relief
to
his
fears
it
was
not
for
his
wife
or
child
that
the
wail
was
being
made
it
was
tisquantum
who
lay
on
the
bed
of
death
and
who
turned
his
dim
and
sunken
eyes
towards
him
as
he
passed
the
threshold
the
old
man
smiled
a
joyful
welcome
and
held
out
his
trembling
hand
to
greet
him
and
oriana
who
was
seated
on
the
ground
by
her
father
bedside
in
an
attitude
of
deep
and
silent
sorrow
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
throwing
herself
into
her
husband
arms
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
are
come
at
lest
she
exclaimed
are
come
in
time
to
see
my
father
die
and
to
receive
his
blessing
o
henrich
how
i
have
hoped
end
preyed
for
your
return
i
feared
you
would
be
too
late
and
my
beloved
father
has
something
to
confide
to
you
i
know
he
has
which
will
fill
your
soul
with
joy
father
she
continued
in
a
calmer
voice
as
she
led
henrich
to
his
side
and
joined
their
hands
in
her
own
father
say
those
blessed
words
again
tell
your
son
that
you
believe
and
love
the
christian
god
and
that
you
desire
to
die
in
this
faith
henrich
was
surprised
he
had
not
hoped
that
tisquantum
had
been
thus
far
influenced
by
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
of
the
christian
religion
and
his
joy
was
equal
to
his
astonishment
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
old
chief
countenance
and
pressed
his
withered
hand
at
length
in
a
feeble
but
calm
and
decided
voice
tisquantum
spoke
son
it
is
true
i
have
observed
and
listened
but
i
have
held
my
peace
when
you
were
a
boy
you
talked
to
me
of
the
christian
god
and
i
smiled
in
my
soul
at
your
ignorance
then
i
found
that
you
believed
in
the
great
mahneto
and
i
was
satisfied
but
for
years
i
have
studied
your
character
to
find
out
why
young
as
you
were
i
felt
for
you
a
respect
that
i
never
felt
for
any
human
being
except
my
own
heroic
father
at
last
i
understood
that
it
was
because
your
religion
made
you
true
and
brave
and
good
and
kept
you
from
committing
any
of
the
crimes
that
i
saw
others
guilty
of
if
all
your
nation
acted
as
you
have
done
henrich
their
coming
to
this
land
would
have
proved
a
blessing
indeed
to
the
red
men
and
our
people
would
not
hate
them
and
seek
to
destroy
them
as
i
once
sought
to
do
but
enough
of
this
my
strength
is
failing
henrich
your
example
has
taught
me
that
your
god
is
holy
and
just
and
good
it
has
made
me
feel
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
tears
of
humble
joy
and
gratitude
glistened
in
henrich
eyes
at
this
confession
he
knelt
beside
the
dying
convert
and
bowed
his
head
upon
the
bed
but
his
heart
was
too
full
to
allow
him
to
express
his
thanksgivings
audibly
oriana
was
equally
affected
but
another
form
knelt
beside
them
and
another
deep
rich
voice
arose
in
prayer
which
was
uttered
fluently
in
the
indian
language
and
in
which
the
hearts
of
all
present
joined
fervently
although
the
speaker
was
a
stranger
to
all
but
henrich
it
was
roger
williams
who
had
been
an
unobserved
witness
of
the
foregoing
deeply
interesting
scene
and
had
listened
with
deep
and
grateful
emotion
to
the
words
of
the
expiring
chief
he
now
spoke
the
feelings
of
all
his
auditors
and
with
his
wonted
power
and
eloquence
poured
forth
a
fervent
prayer
for
the
aged
in
christ
and
blessed
the
god
of
all
spirits
that
it
had
pleased
him
even
the
eleventh
hour
to
call
the
heathen
chief
into
the
fold
of
christ
when
his
prayer
was
finished
henrich
presented
his
friend
and
brother
to
his
and
told
him
that
from
his
lips
he
might
bear
all
that
one
of
the
lord
most
zealous
and
devoted
ministers
could
tell
him
of
holy
and
eternal
things
gladly
the
old
man
availed
himself
of
this
opportunity
of
obtaining
instruction
end
being
prepared
for
what
he
now
earnestly
desired
an
admittance
by
baptism
into
the
once
despised
religion
of
the
white
men
for
this
task
no
man
was
more
fitted
than
roger
williams
he
well
knew
how
to
deal
with
indian
prejudices
and
bow
to
call
forth
the
affections
by
the
relation
of
the
simple
and
touching
truths
of
the
gospel
tisquantum
heard
with
a
willing
and
teachable
spirit
and
he
believed
and
was
at
peace
his
life
was
rapidly
ebbing
away
and
no
time
was
to
be
lost
for
though
he
rallied
a
little
after
the
arrival
of
henrich
and
roger
it
was
evident
that
his
time
on
earth
could
only
be
counted
by
hours
the
following
morning
therefore
at
his
own
earnest
desire
he
was
baptised
by
williams
in
the
presence
of
his
rejoicing
children
and
of
jyanough
and
mailah
who
formed
a
little
congregation
of
sincere
christians
in
the
midst
of
an
heathen
population
the
venerable
chieftain
did
not
long
survive
his
admission
into
the
pale
of
the
visible
church
of
christ
his
strength
faded
hour
by
hour
but
he
was
calm
and
collected
to
the
last
he
gave
to
henrich
all
his
parting
directions
for
the
government
of
his
people
if
he
still
continued
to
live
among
them
and
to
be
their
sachem
he
added
know
that
your
heart
is
with
your
own
people
and
that
you
desire
to
return
to
your
former
home
i
can
not
blame
you
for
i
well
know
the
yearning
of
spirit
that
draws
a
man
to
his
kindred
and
to
his
house
and
oriana
will
go
with
you
and
make
your
home
and
your
people
her
own
if
this
is
to
be
then
let
jyanough
be
sachem
in
your
stead
he
also
is
just
and
upright
and
will
guide
my
warriors
with
courage
and
wisdom
there
is
none
besides
yourself
to
whom
i
could
so
confidently
leave
them
and
now
farewell
my
children
may
the
good
god
in
whom
you
trust
receive
my
sinful
soul
for
his
son
sake
and
may
his
blessing
rest
on
those
who
have
led
me
into
the
truth
tisquantum
had
been
supported
in
his
bed
while
he
thus
took
leave
of
his
sorrowing
relatives
and
friends
he
now
lay
down
and
never
rose
again
neither
did
he
utter
many
more
words
but
lay
as
if
engaged
in
thought
and
prayer
and
occasionally
fixed
his
failing
eyes
with
fond
affection
on
his
child
and
henrich
at
length
they
gently
closed
and
the
venerable
old
chief
slept
the
sleep
of
death
oriana
grief
was
deep
and
sincere
for
she
had
loved
her
father
almost
passionately
but
she
did
not
now
as
those
without
hope
and
ere
long
she
was
calm
the
funeral
was
conducted
in
the
simple
manner
of
the
puritans
and
all
tisquantum
warriors
stood
respectfully
and
silently
round
his
grave
while
williams
addressed
them
in
their
own
language
and
exhorted
them
to
follow
the
example
of
their
departed
chief
and
examine
the
faith
of
the
christians
and
embrace
it
to
the
salvation
of
their
souls
not
long
after
the
death
of
tisquantum
and
before
the
severity
of
winter
prevented
the
journey
being
practicable
henrich
and
his
wife
took
leave
of
the
nausetts
and
of
their
christian
friends
jyanough
and
mailah
and
accompanied
by
roger
williams
and
two
or
three
indian
attendants
who
desired
to
follow
their
fortunes
took
their
way
towards
new
plymouth
their
departure
from
paomet
was
much
regretted
for
they
were
greatly
beloved
by
the
red
men
but
the
promotion
of
jyanough
to
the
chieftainship
gave
general
satisfaction
and
there
were
even
some
who
thought
it
was
more
consistent
with
their
dignity
and
independence
to
be
governed
by
one
of
their
own
race
rather
than
by
a
let
his
personal
qualities
he
ever
so
estimable
henrich
heart
beat
high
when
he
again
arrived
at
his
dwelling
and
presented
his
wife
and
child
to
his
parents
and
his
sister
he
cast
searching
glances
at
their
countenances
to
read
their
feelings
at
thus
greeting
an
as
their
near
relative
but
he
saw
no
expression
that
could
give
him
pain
on
the
contrary
the
native
grace
and
beauty
of
oriana
and
the
gentle
refinement
of
her
manner
evidently
struck
them
with
surprise
and
pleasure
and
made
upon
them
all
a
most
favorable
impression
nor
did
a
further
acquaintance
lessen
this
kindly
feeling
it
was
impossible
to
know
oriana
and
not
to
love
her
and
she
was
soon
regarded
as
a
daughter
and
a
sister
by
all
her
husband
relatives
while
the
young
ludovico
was
cherished
and
caressed
by
all
the
household
and
by
none
more
than
by
his
little
cousin
edith
the
maitlands
were
now
a
happy
family
and
when
in
the
ensuing
spring
their
daughter
and
her
husband
again
left
them
to
return
to
their
distant
home
at
providence
they
felt
they
had
still
a
daughter
left
to
them
in
the
indian
wife
of
their
beloved
henrich
this
son
did
not
again
leave
them
except
to
pay
occasional
visits
with
oriana
to
their
nausett
friends
but
he
fixed
his
permanent
home
at
plymouth
where
his
knowledge
of
the
indian
language
and
manners
and
the
influence
he
continued
to
possess
among
the
nausetts
and
other
neighboring
tribes
enabled
him
frequently
to
render
important
services
both
to
his
own
countrymen
and
the
red
natives
his
own
merits
likewise
won
for
him
the
love
and
respect
of
the
settlers
of
new
plymouth
who
appreciated
the
unaffected
devotion
and
the
simple
truthfulness
of
his
character
and
felt
that
such
men
as
rodolph
maitland
and
his
son
added
glory
to
the
history
of
pilgrim
fathers
