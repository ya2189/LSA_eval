and
his

told

the
agent
we
class
schools
in
four
grades
leading

school
good
school
and
school
sedleigh
in
mike
and
psmith
would
i
suppose
come
into
the
class
though
not
quite
as
low
in
it
as
waugh
llanabba
it
is
one
of
those
small
english
schools
with
aspirations
one
day
to
be
able
to
put
the
word
public
before
their
name
and
to
have
their
headmaster
qualified
to
attend
the
annual
headmaster
conference
all
it
needs
is
a
few
more
adairs
to
get
things
going
and
there
is
this
to
be
noted
that
even
at
a
school
one
gets
an
excellent
education
its
only
drawback
is
that
it
does
not
play
the
leading
schools
or
the
schools
or
even
the
good
schools
at
cricket
but
to
mike
fresh
from
wrykyn
a
school
and
psmith
coming
from
eton
a
leading
school
sedleigh
naturally
seemed
something
of
a
comedown
it
took
mike
some
time
to
adjust
himself
to
it
though
psmith
the
philosopher
accepted
the
change
of
conditions
with
his
customary
equanimity
this
was
the
first
appearance
of
psmith
he
came
into
two
other
books
in
the
and
before
becoming
happily
married
in
it
to
but
i
have
always
thought
that
he
was
most
at
home
in
this
story
of
english
school
life
to
give
full
play
to
his
bland
clashings
with
authority
he
needs
to
have
authority
to
clash
with
and
there
is
none
more
absolute
than
that
of
the
masters
at
an
english
school
psmith
has
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
one
of
my
numerous
characters
to
be
drawn
from
a
living
model
a
cousin
of
mine
was
at
eton
with
the
son
of
carte
the
man
who
produced
the
gilbert
and
sullivan
operettas
and
one
night
he
told
me
about
this
peculiar
schoolboy
who
dressed
fastidiously
and
wore
a
monocle
and
who
when
one
of
the
masters
inquired
after
his
health
replied
sir
i
grow
thinnah
and
thinnah
it
was
all
the
information
i
required
in
order
to
start
building
him
in
a
star
part
if
anyone
is
curious
as
to
what
became
of
mike
and
psmith
in
later
life
i
can
supply
the
facts
mike
always
devoted
to
country
life
ran
a
prosperous
farm
psmith
inevitably
perhaps
became
an
equally
prosperous
counselor
at
the
bar
like
perry
mason
specializing
like
perry
in
appearing
for
the
defense
i
must
apologize
as
i
did
in
the
preface
to
at
wrykyn
for
all
the
cricket
in
this
book
it
was
unavoidable
there
is
however
not
quite
so
much
of
it
this
time
wodehouse
jackson
makes
up
his
mind
if
mike
had
been
in
time
for
breakfast
that
fatal
easter
morning
he
might
have
gathered
from
the
expression
on
his
father
face
as
jackson
opened
the
envelope
containing
his
school
report
and
read
the
contents
that
the
document
in
question
was
not
exactly
a
paean
of
praise
from
beginning
to
end
but
he
was
late
as
usual
mike
always
was
late
for
breakfast
in
the
holidays
when
he
came
down
on
this
particular
morning
the
meal
was
nearly
over
jackson
had
disappeared
taking
his
correspondence
with
him
jackson
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
and
when
mike
appeared
the
thing
had
resolved
itself
into
a
mere
vulgar
brawl
between
phyllis
and
ella
for
the
jam
while
marjory
recently
affecting
a
air
looked
on
in
a
detached
sort
of
way
as
if
these
juvenile
gambols
distressed
her
hello
mike
she
said
jumping
up
as
he
entered
here
you
are
been
keeping
everything
hot
for
you
have
you
thanks
awfully
i
say
his
eye
wandered
in
mild
surprise
round
the
table
i
a
bit
late
marjory
was
bustling
about
fetching
and
carrying
for
mike
as
she
always
did
she
had
adopted
him
at
an
early
age
and
did
the
thing
thoroughly
she
was
fond
of
her
other
brothers
especially
when
they
made
centuries
in
cricket
but
mike
was
her
favorite
she
would
field
out
in
the
deep
as
a
natural
thing
when
mike
was
batting
at
the
net
in
the
paddock
though
for
the
others
even
for
joe
who
had
played
in
all
five
test
matches
in
the
previous
summer
she
would
do
it
only
as
a
favor
phyllis
and
ella
finished
their
dispute
and
went
out
marjory
sat
on
the
table
and
watched
mike
eat
your
report
came
this
morning
mike
she
said
the
kidneys
failed
to
retain
mike
undivided
attention
he
looked
up
interested
what
did
it
say
i
did
see
i
only
caught
sight
of
the
wrykyn
crest
on
the
envelope
father
did
say
anything
mike
seemed
concerned
i
say
that
looks
rather
rotten
i
wonder
if
it
was
awfully
bad
it
the
first
i
had
from
appleby
it
ca
be
any
worse
than
the
horrid
ones
blake
used
to
write
when
you
were
in
his
form
no
that
a
comfort
said
mike
philosophically
think
there
any
more
tea
in
that
pot
i
call
it
a
shame
said
marjory
they
ought
to
be
jolly
glad
to
have
you
at
wrykyn
just
for
cricket
instead
of
writing
beastly
reports
that
make
father
angry
and
do
do
any
good
to
anybody
last
christmas
he
said
he
take
me
away
if
i
got
another
one
he
did
mean
it
really
i
he
did
he
could
you
the
best
bat
wrykyn
ever
had
what
ho
interpolated
mike
you
everybody
says
you
are
why
you
got
your
first
the
very
first
term
you
were
there
even
joe
did
do
anything
nearly
so
good
as
that
saunders
says
you
simply
bound
to
play
for
england
in
another
year
or
two
saunders
is
a
jolly
good
chap
he
bowled
me
a
half
volley
on
the
off
the
first
ball
i
had
in
a
school
match
by
the
way
i
wonder
if
he
out
at
the
net
now
let
go
and
see
saunders
the
professional
was
setting
up
the
net
when
they
arrived
mike
put
on
his
pads
and
went
to
the
wicket
while
marjory
and
the
dogs
retired
as
usual
to
the
far
hedge
to
retrieve
she
was
kept
busy
saunders
was
a
good
sound
bowler
of
the
minor
match
type
and
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
had
worried
mike
considerably
but
mike
had
been
in
the
wrykyn
team
for
three
seasons
now
and
each
season
he
had
advanced
tremendously
in
his
batting
he
had
filled
out
in
three
years
he
had
always
had
the
style
and
now
he
had
the
strength
as
well
saunder
bowling
on
a
true
wicket
seemed
simple
to
him
it
was
early
in
the
easter
holidays
but
already
he
was
beginning
to
find
his
form
saunders
who
looked
on
mike
as
his
own
special
invention
was
delighted
if
you
do
be
worried
by
being
too
anxious
now
that
you
captain
master
mike
he
said
you
make
a
century
every
match
next
term
i
wish
i
was
it
a
beastly
responsibility
henfrey
the
wrykyn
cricket
captain
of
the
previous
season
was
not
returning
next
term
and
mike
was
to
reign
in
his
stead
he
liked
the
prospect
but
it
certainly
carried
with
it
a
rather
responsibility
at
night
sometimes
he
would
lie
awake
appalled
by
the
fear
of
losing
his
form
or
making
a
hash
of
things
by
choosing
the
wrong
men
to
play
for
the
school
and
leaving
the
right
men
out
it
is
no
light
thing
to
captain
a
public
school
at
cricket
as
he
was
walking
toward
the
house
phyllis
met
him
oh
i
been
hunting
for
you
mike
father
wants
you
what
for
i
do
know
where
he
in
the
study
he
seems
added
phyllis
throwing
in
the
information
by
a
way
of
a
makeweight
in
a
beastly
temper
mike
jaw
fell
slightly
i
hope
the
dickens
it
nothing
to
do
with
that
bally
report
was
his
muttered
exclamation
mike
dealings
with
his
father
were
as
a
rule
of
a
most
pleasant
nature
jackson
was
an
understanding
sort
of
man
who
treated
his
sons
as
companions
from
time
to
time
however
breezes
were
apt
to
ruffle
the
placid
sea
of
good
fellowship
mike
report
was
an
unfailing
wind
raiser
indeed
on
the
arrival
of
sarcastic
resume
of
mike
shortcomings
at
the
end
of
the
previous
term
there
had
been
something
not
unlike
a
typhoon
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
jackson
had
solemnly
declared
his
intention
of
removing
mike
from
wrykyn
unless
the
critics
became
more
flattering
and
jackson
was
a
man
of
his
word
it
was
with
a
certain
amount
of
apprehension
therefore
that
jackson
entered
the
study
come
in
mike
said
his
father
kicking
the
basket
i
want
to
speak
to
you
mike
skilled
in
omens
scented
a
row
in
the
offing
only
in
moments
of
emotion
was
jackson
in
the
habit
of
booting
the
basket
there
followed
an
awkward
silence
which
mike
broke
by
remarking
that
he
had
carted
a
half
volley
from
saunders
over
the
hedge
that
morning
it
was
just
a
bit
short
and
off
the
leg
stump
so
i
stepped
out
may
i
bag
the
paper
knife
for
a
jiffy
i
just
show
never
mind
about
cricket
now
said
jackson
i
want
you
to
listen
to
this
report
oh
is
that
my
report
father
said
mike
with
a
sort
of
sickly
interest
much
as
a
dog
about
to
be
washed
might
evince
in
his
tub
it
is
replied
jackson
in
measured
tones
your
report
what
is
more
it
is
without
exception
the
worst
report
you
have
ever
had
oh
i
say
groaned
the
conduct
quoted
jackson
been
unsatisfactory
in
the
extreme
both
in
and
out
of
school
it
was
anything
really
i
only
happened
remembering
suddenly
that
what
he
had
happened
to
do
was
to
drop
a
cannonball
the
school
weight
on
the
floor
not
once
but
on
several
occasions
he
paused
bad
conduct
disgraceful
everybody
rags
in
french
bad
inattentive
and
idle
nobody
does
much
work
in
math
poor
greek
very
poor
we
were
doing
thucydides
book
two
last
term
all
speeches
and
doubtful
readings
and
cruxes
and
things
beastly
hard
everybody
says
so
here
are
appleby
remarks
boy
has
genuine
ability
which
he
declines
to
use
in
the
smallest
degree
mike
moaned
a
moan
of
righteous
indignation
abnormal
proficiency
at
games
has
apparently
destroyed
all
desire
in
him
to
realize
the
more
serious
issues
of
life
there
is
more
to
the
same
effect
appleby
was
a
master
with
very
definite
ideas
as
to
what
constituted
a
master
duties
as
a
man
he
was
distinctly
he
understood
cricket
and
some
of
mike
strokes
on
the
off
gave
him
thrills
of
pure
aesthetic
joy
but
as
a
master
he
always
made
it
his
habit
to
regard
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
boys
in
his
form
with
an
unbiased
eye
and
to
an
unbiased
eye
mike
in
a
form
room
was
about
as
near
the
extreme
edge
as
a
boy
could
be
and
appleby
said
as
much
in
a
clear
firm
hand
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
about
your
report
at
christmas
mike
said
jackson
folding
the
lethal
document
and
replacing
it
in
its
envelope
mike
said
nothing
there
was
a
sinking
feeling
in
his
interior
i
shall
abide
by
what
i
said
mike
heart
thumped
you
will
not
go
back
to
wrykyn
next
term
somewhere
in
the
world
the
sun
was
shining
birds
were
twittering
somewhere
in
the
world
lambkins
frisked
and
peasants
sang
blithely
at
their
toil
flat
perhaps
but
still
blithely
but
to
mike
at
that
moment
the
sky
was
black
and
an
icy
wind
blew
over
the
face
of
the
earth
the
tragedy
had
happened
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
he
made
no
attempt
to
appeal
against
the
sentence
he
knew
it
would
be
useless
his
father
when
he
made
up
his
mind
having
all
the
unbending
tenacity
of
the
normally
easygoing
man
jackson
was
sorry
for
mike
he
understood
him
and
for
that
reason
he
said
very
little
now
i
am
sending
you
to
sedleigh
was
his
next
remark
sedleigh
mike
sat
up
with
a
jerk
he
knew
sedleigh
by
name
one
of
those
schools
with
about
a
hundred
boys
which
you
never
hear
of
except
when
they
send
up
their
gym
team
to
aldershot
or
their
eight
to
bisley
mike
outlook
on
life
was
that
of
a
cricketer
pure
and
simple
what
had
sedleigh
ever
done
what
were
they
ever
likely
to
do
whom
did
they
play
what
old
sedleighan
had
ever
done
anything
at
cricket
perhaps
they
did
even
cricket
but
it
an
awful
hole
he
said
blankly
jackson
could
read
mike
mind
like
a
book
mike
point
of
view
was
plain
to
him
he
did
not
approve
of
it
but
he
knew
that
in
mike
place
and
at
mike
age
he
would
have
felt
the
same
he
spoke
dryly
to
hide
his
sympathy
it
is
not
a
large
school
he
said
and
i
do
suppose
it
could
play
wrykyn
at
cricket
but
it
has
one
merit
boys
work
there
young
barlitt
won
a
balliol
scholarship
from
sedleigh
last
year
barlitt
was
the
vicar
son
a
silent
spectacled
youth
who
did
not
enter
very
largely
into
mike
world
they
had
met
occasionally
at
tennis
parties
but
not
much
conversation
had
ensued
barlitt
mind
was
massive
but
his
topics
of
conversation
were
not
mike
barlitt
speaks
very
highly
of
sedleigh
added
jackson
mike
said
nothing
which
was
a
good
deal
better
than
saying
what
he
would
have
liked
to
have
said
sedleigh
the
train
which
had
been
stopping
everywhere
for
the
last
half
hour
pulled
up
again
and
mike
seeing
the
name
of
the
station
got
up
opened
the
door
and
hurled
a
bag
out
on
to
the
platform
in
an
emphatic
and
vindictive
manner
then
he
got
out
himself
and
looked
about
him
for
the
school
sir
inquired
the
solitary
porter
bustling
up
as
if
he
hoped
by
sheer
energy
to
deceive
the
traveler
into
thinking
that
sedleigh
station
was
staffed
by
a
great
army
of
porters
mike
nodded
a
somber
nod
the
nod
napoleon
might
have
given
if
somebody
had
met
him
in
and
said
so
you
back
from
moscow
eh
mike
was
feeling
thoroughly
jaundiced
the
future
seemed
wholly
gloomy
and
so
far
from
attempting
to
make
the
best
of
things
he
had
set
himself
deliberately
to
look
on
the
dark
side
he
thought
for
instance
that
he
had
never
seen
a
more
repulsive
porter
or
one
more
obviously
incompetent
than
the
man
who
had
attached
himself
with
a
firm
grasp
to
the
handle
of
the
bag
as
he
strode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
luggage
van
he
disliked
his
voice
his
appearance
and
the
color
of
his
hair
also
the
boots
he
wore
he
hated
the
station
and
the
man
who
took
his
ticket
young
gents
at
the
school
sir
said
the
porter
perceiving
from
mike
air
that
the
boy
was
a
stranger
to
the
place
goes
up
in
the
bus
mostly
it
waiting
here
sir
hi
george
i
walk
thanks
said
mike
frigidly
it
a
goodish
step
sir
here
you
are
thank
you
sir
i
send
up
your
luggage
by
the
bus
sir
which
was
it
you

sir
it
straight
on
up
this
road
to
the
school
you
ca

sir
worse
luck
said
mike
he
walked
off
up
the
road
sorrier
for
himself
than
ever
it
was
such
absolutely
rotten
luck
about
now
instead
of
being
on
his
way
to
a
place
where
they
probably
ran
a
halma
team
instead
of
a
cricket
eleven
and
played
in
winter
he
would
be
on
the
point
of
arriving
at
wrykyn
and
as
captain
of
cricket
at
that
which
was
the
bitter
part
of
it
he
had
never
been
in
command
for
the
last
two
seasons
he
had
been
the
star
man
going
in
first
and
heading
the
averages
easily
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
the
three
captains
under
whom
he
had
played
during
his
career
as
a
wrykynian
burgess
enderby
and
henfrey
had
always
been
sportsmen
to
him
but
it
was
not
the
same
thing
he
had
meant
to
do
such
a
lot
for
wrykyn
cricket
this
term
he
had
had
an
entirely
new
system
of
coaching
in
his
mind
now
it
might
never
be
used
he
had
handed
it
on
in
a
letter
to
strachan
who
would
be
captain
in
his
place
but
probably
strachan
would
have
some
scheme
of
his
own
there
is
nobody
who
could
not
edit
a
paper
in
the
ideal
way
and
there
is
nobody
who
has
not
a
theory
of
his
own
about
cricket
coaching
at
school
wrykyn
too
would
be
weak
this
year
now
that
he
was
no
longer
there
strachan
was
a
good
free
bat
on
his
day
and
if
he
survived
a
few
overs
might
make
a
century
in
an
hour
but
he
was
not
to
be
depended
upon
there
was
no
doubt
that
mike
sudden
withdrawal
meant
that
wrykyn
would
have
a
bad
time
that
season
and
it
had
been
such
a
wretched
athletic
year
for
the
school
the
football
fifteen
had
been
hopeless
and
had
lost
both
the
ripton
matches
the
return
by
over
sixty
points
sheen
victory
in
the
light
weights
at
aldershot
had
been
their
one
success
and
now
on
top
of
all
this
the
captain
of
cricket
was
removed
during
the
easter
holidays
mike
heart
bled
for
wrykyn
and
he
found
himself
loathing
sedleigh
and
all
its
works
with
a
great
loathing
the
only
thing
he
could
find
in
its
favor
was
the
fact
that
it
was
set
in
a
very
pretty
country
of
a
different
type
from
the
wrykyn
country
but
almost
as
good
for
three
miles
mike
made
his
way
through
woods
and
past
fields
once
he
crossed
a
river
it
was
soon
after
this
that
he
caught
sight
from
the
top
of
a
hill
of
a
group
of
buildings
that
wore
an
unmistakably
schoollike
look
this
must
be
sedleigh
ten
minutes
walk
brought
him
to
the
school
gates
and
a
baker
boy
directed
him
to
outwood
there
were
three
houses
in
a
row
separated
from
the
school
buildings
by
a
cricket
field
outwood
was
the
middle
one
of
these
mike
went
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
at
wrykyn
he
had
always
charged
in
at
the
beginning
of
term
at
the
boys
entrance
but
this
formal
reporting
of
himself
at
sedleigh
suited
his
mood
he
inquired
for
outwood
and
was
shown
into
a
room
lined
with
books
presently
the
door
opened
and
the
housemaster
appeared
there
was
something
pleasant
and
homely
about
outwood
in
appearance
he
reminded
mike
of
smee
in
he
had
the
same
eyebrows
and
and
the
same
motherly
look
jackson
he
said
mildly
yes
sir
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
very
glad
indeed
perhaps
you
would
like
a
cup
of
tea
after
your
journey
i
think
you
might
like
a
cup
of
tea
you
come
from
crofton
in
shropshire
i
understand
jackson
near
brindleford
it
is
a
part
of
the
country
which
i
have
always
wished
to
visit
i
dare
say
you
have
frequently
seen
the
cluniac
priory
of
ambrose
at
brindleford
mike
who
would
not
have
recognized
a
cluniac
priory
if
you
had
handed
him
one
on
a
tray
said
he
had
not
dear
me
you
have
missed
an
opportunity
which
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
i
am
preparing
a
book
on
ruined
abbeys
and
priories
of
england
and
it
has
always
been
my
wish
to
see
the
cluniac
priory
of
ambrose
a
deeply
interesting
relic
of
the
sixteenth
century
bishop
geoffrey
shall
i
go
across
to
the
boys
part
sir
what
yes
oh
yes
quite
so
and
perhaps
you
would
like
a
cup
of
tea
after
your
journey
no
quite
so
quite
so
you
should
make
a
point
of
visiting
the
remains
of
the
cluniac
priory
in
the
summer
holidays
jackson
you
will
find
the
matron
in
her
room
in
many
respects
it
is
unique
the
northern
altar
is
in
a
state
of
really
wonderful
preservation
it
consists
of
a
solid
block
of
masonry
five
feet
long
and
two
and
a
half
wide
with
chamfered
plinth
standing
quite
free
from
the
apse
wall
it
will
well
repay
a
visit
for
the
present
jackson
mike
wandered
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
his
gloom
visibly
deepened
all
alone
in
a
strange
school
where
they
probably
played
hopscotch
with
a
housemaster
who
offered
one
cups
of
tea
after
journey
and
talked
about
chamfered
plinths
and
apses
it
was
a
little
hard
he
strayed
about
finding
his
bearings
and
finally
came
to
a
room
which
he
took
to
be
the
equivalent
of
the
senior
day
room
at
a
wrykyn
house
everywhere
else
he
had
found
nothing
but
emptiness
evidently
he
had
come
by
an
earlier
train
than
was
usual
but
this
room
was
occupied
a
very
long
thin
youth
with
a
solemn
face
and
immaculate
clothes
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
as
mike
entered
he
fumbled
in
his
top
left
waistcoat
pocket
produced
an
eyeglass
attached
to
a
cord
and
fixed
it
in
his
right
eye
with
the
help
of
this
aid
to
vision
he
inspected
mike
in
silence
for
a
while
then
having
flicked
an
invisible
speck
of
dust
from
the
left
sleeve
of
his
coat
he
spoke
hello
he
said
he
spoke
in
a
tired
voice
hello
said
mike
take
a
seat
said
the
immaculate
one
if
you
do
mind
dirtying
your
bags
that
to
say
personally
i
do
see
any
prospect
of
ever
sitting
down
in
this
place
it
looks
to
me
as
if
they
meant
to
use
these
chairs
as
beds
a
nursery
garden
in
the
home
that
sort
of
idea
my
name
he
added
pensively
is
smith
what
yours
psmith
jackson
said
mike
are
you
the
bully
the
pride
of
the
school
or
the
boy
who
is
led
astray
and
takes
to
drink
in
chapter
sixteen
the
last
for
choice
said
mike
but
i
only
just
arrived
so
i
do
know
the
boy
what
will
he
become
are
you
new
here
too
then
yes
why
are
you
new
do
i
look
as
if
i
belonged
here
i
the
latest
import
sit
down
on
yonder
settee
and
i
will
tell
you
the
painful
story
of
my
life
by
the
way
before
i
start
there
just
one
thing
if
you
ever
have
occasion
to
write
to
me
would
you
mind
sticking
a
p
at
the
beginning
of
my
name
see
there
are
too
many
smiths
and
i
do
care
for
smythe
my
father
content
to
worry
along
in
the
way
but
i
decided
to
strike
out
a
fresh
line
i
shall
found
a
new
dynasty
the
resolve
came
to
me
unexpectedly
this
morning
i
jotted
it
down
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
in
conversation
you
may
address
me
as
rupert
though
i
hope
you
wo
or
simply
smith
the
not
being
sounded
compare
the
name
zbysco
in
which
the
z
is
given
a
similar
see
mike
said
he
saw
psmith
thanked
him
with
a
certain
stately
old
world
courtesy
let
us
start
at
the
beginning
he
resumed
my
infancy
when
i
was
but
a
babe
my
eldest
sister
was
bribed
with
a
shilling
an
hour
by
my
nurse
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
and
see
that
i
did
not
raise
cain
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
she
struck
for
and
got
it
we
now
pass
to
my
boyhood
at
an
early
age
i
was
sent
to
eton
everybody
predicting
a
bright
career
for
me
but
said
psmith
solemnly
fixing
an
gaze
on
mike
through
the
eyeglass
it
was
not
to
be
no
said
mike
no
i
was
superannuated
last
term
bad
luck
for
eton
yes
but
what
eton
loses
sedleigh
gains
but
why
sedleigh
of
all
places
this
is
the
most
painful
part
of
my
narrative
it
seems
that
a
certain
scug
in
the
next
village
to
ours
happened
last
year
to
collar
a
balliol
not
barlitt
exclaimed
mike
that
was
the
man
the
son
of
the
vicar
the
vicar
told
the
curate
who
told
our
curate
who
told
our
vicar
who
told
my
father
who
sent
me
off
here
to
get
a
balliol
too
do
know
barlitt
his
father
vicar
of
our
village
it
was
because
his
son
got
a
balliol
that
i
was
sent
here
do
you
come
from
crofton
yes
i
lived
at
lower
benford
all
my
life
we
are
practically
brothers
cheer
a
little
will
you
mike
felt
as
robinson
crusoe
felt
when
he
met
friday
here
was
a
fellow
human
being
in
this
desert
place
he
could
almost
have
embraced
psmith
the
very
sound
of
the
name
lower
benford
was
heartening
his
dislike
for
his
new
school
was
not
diminished
but
now
he
felt
that
life
there
might
at
least
be
tolerable
where
were
you
before
you
came
here
asked
psmith
you
have
heard
my
painful
story
now
tell
me
yours
wrykyn
my
father
took
me
away
because
i
got
such
a
lot
of
bad
reports
my
reports
from
eton
were
simply
scurrilous
there
a
libel
action
in
every
sentence
how
do
you
like
this
place
from
what
you
seen
of
it
rotten
i
am
with
you
comrade
jackson
you
wo
mind
my
calling
you
comrade
will
you
i
just
become
a
socialist
it
a
great
scheme
you
ought
to
be
one
you
work
for
the
equal
distribution
of
property
and
start
by
collaring
all
you
can
and
sitting
on
it
we
must
stick
together
we
are
companions
in
misfortune
lost
lambs
sheep
that
have
gone
astray
divided
we
fall
together
we
may
worry
through
have
you
seen
professor
radium
yet
i
should
say
outwood
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
does
seem
a
bad
sort
of
chap
bit
off
his
nut
jawed
about
apses
and
things
and
thereby
said
psmith
hangs
a
tale
i
been
making
inquiries
of
a
stout
sportsman
in
a
sort
of
salvation
army
uniform
whom
i
met
in
the
grounds
he
the
school
sergeant
or
something
quite
a
solid
man
and
i
hear
that
comrade
outwood
an
archaeological
cove
goes
about
the
country
beating
up
old
ruins
and
fossils
and
things
there
an
archaeological
society
in
the
school
run
by
him
it
goes
out
on
prowling
about
and
is
allowed
to
break
bounds
and
generally
steep
itself
to
the
eyebrows
in
reckless
devilry
and
mark
you
laddie
if
you
belong
to
the
archaeological
society
you
get
off
cricket
to
get
off
cricket
said
psmith
dusting
his
right
trouser
leg
was
the
dream
of
my
youth
and
the
aspiration
of
my
riper
years
a
noble
game
but
a
bit
too
thick
for
me
at
eton
i
used
to
have
to
field
out
at
the
nets
till
the
soles
of
my
boots
wore
through
i
suppose
you
are
a
blood
at
the
game
play
for
the
school
against
loamshire
and
so
on
i
not
going
to
play
here
at
any
rate
said
mike
he
had
made
up
his
mind
on
this
point
in
the
train
there
is
a
certain
fascination
about
making
the
very
worst
of
a
bad
job
achilles
knew
his
business
when
he
sat
in
his
tent
the
determination
not
to
play
cricket
for
sedleigh
as
he
could
not
play
for
wrykyn
gave
mike
a
sort
of
pleasure
to
stand
by
with
folded
arms
and
a
somber
frown
as
it
were
was
one
way
of
treating
the
situation
and
one
not
without
its
meed
of
comfort
psmith
approved
the
resolve
stout
fellow
he
said
is
well
you
and
i
hand
in
hand
will
search
the
countryside
for
ruined
abbeys
we
will
snare
the
elusive
fossil
together
above
all
we
will
go
out
of
bounds
we
shall
thus
improve
our
minds
and
have
a
jolly
good
time
as
well
i
wonder
if
one
might
borrow
a
gun
from
some
friendly
native
and
do
a
bit
of
rabbit
shooting
here
and
there
from
what
i
saw
of
comrade
outwood
during
our
brief
interview
i
should
think
he
was
one
of
the
contingent
with
tact
we
ought
to
be
able
to
slip
away
from
the
merry
throng
of
fossil
chasers
and
do
a
bit
on
our
own
account
good
idea
said
mike
we
will
a
chap
at
wrykyn
called
wyatt
used
to
break
out
at
night
and
shoot
at
cats
with
an
air
pistol
it
would
take
a
lot
to
make
me
do
that
i
am
all
against
anything
that
interferes
with
my
sleep
but
rabbits
in
the
daytime
is
a
scheme
nose
about
for
a
gun
at
the
earliest
opp
meanwhile
we
better
go
up
to
comrade
outwood
and
get
our
names
shoved
down
for
the
society
i
vote
we
get
some
tea
first
somewhere
then
let
beat
up
a
study
i
suppose
they
have
studies
here
let
go
and
look
they
went
upstairs
on
the
first
floor
there
was
a
passage
with
doors
on
either
side
psmith
opened
the
first
of
these
this
do
us
well
he
said
it
was
a
biggish
room
looking
out
over
the
school
grounds
there
were
a
couple
of
deal
tables
two
empty
bookcases
and
a
looking
glass
hung
on
a
nail
might
have
been
made
for
us
said
psmith
approvingly
i
suppose
it
belongs
to
some
rotter
not
now
you
are
going
to
collar
it
that
said
psmith
looking
at
himself
earnestly
in
the
mirror
and
straightening
his
tie
is
the
exact
program
we
must
stake
out
our
claims
this
is
practical
socialism
but
the
real
owner
bound
to
turn
up
some
time
or
other
his
misfortune
not
ours
you
ca
expect
two
masterminds
like
us
to
pig
it
in
that
room
downstairs
there
are
moments
when
one
wants
to
be
alone
it
is
imperative
that
we
have
a
place
to
retire
to
after
a
fatiguing
day
and
now
if
you
want
to
be
really
useful
come
and
help
me
fetch
up
my
box
from
downstairs
it
got
a
gas
ring
and
various
things
in
it
staking
out
a
claim
psmith
in
the
matter
of
decorating
a
study
and
preparing
tea
in
it
was
rather
a
critic
than
an
executant
he
was
full
of
ideas
but
he
preferred
to
allow
mike
to
carry
them
out
it
was
he
who
suggested
that
the
wooden
bar
which
ran
across
the
window
was
unnecessary
but
it
was
mike
who
wrenched
it
from
its
place
similarly
it
was
mike
who
abstracted
the
key
from
the
door
of
the
next
study
though
the
idea
was
psmith
privacy
said
psmith
as
he
watched
mike
light
the
gas
ring
is
what
we
chiefly
need
in
this
age
of
publicity
if
you
leave
a
study
door
unlocked
in
these
strenuous
times
the
first
thing
you
know
is
somebody
comes
right
in
sits
down
and
begins
to
talk
about
himself
i
think
with
a
little
care
we
ought
to
be
able
to
make
this
room
quite
decently
comfortable
that
putrid
calendar
must
come
down
though
do
you
think
you
could
make
a
long
arm
and
haul
it
off
the
parent
tintack
thanks
we
make
progress
we
make
progress
we
shall
jolly
well
make
it
out
of
the
window
said
mike
spooning
up
tea
from
a
paperbag
with
a
postcard
if
a
sort
of
young
hackenschmidt
turns
up
and
claims
the
study
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
do
let
us
worry
about
it
i
have
a
presentiment
that
he
will
be
an
little
weed
how
are
you
getting
on
with
the
evening
meal
just
ready
what
would
you
give
to
be
at
eton
now
i
give
something
to
be
at
wrykyn
these
school
reports
said
psmith
sympathetically
are
the
very
dickens
many
a
bright
young
lad
has
been
soured
by
them
hello
this
i
wonder
a
heavy
body
had
plunged
against
the
door
evidently
without
a
suspicion
that
there
would
be
any
resistance
a
rattling
of
the
handle
followed
and
a
voice
outside
said
dash
the
door
hackenschmidt
said
mike
the
weed
said
psmith
you
could
make
a
long
arm
could
you
and
turn
the
key
we
had
better
give
this
merchant
audience
remind
me
later
to
go
on
with
my
remarks
on
school
reports
i
had
several
bright
things
to
say
on
the
subject
mike
unlocked
the
door
and
flung
it
open
framed
in
the
entrance
was
a
smallish
freckled
boy
wearing
a
hat
and
carrying
a
bag
on
his
face
was
an
expression
of
mingled
wrath
and
astonishment
psmith
rose
courteously
from
his
chair
and
moved
forward
with
slow
stateliness
to
do
the
honors
what
the
dickens
inquired
the
newcomer
are
you
doing
here
we
were
having
a
little
tea
said
psmith
to
restore
our
tissues
after
our
journey
come
in
and
join
us
we
keep
open
house
we
psmiths
let
me
introduce
you
to
comrade
jackson
a
stout
fellow
homely
in
appearance
perhaps
but
one
of
us
i
am
psmith
your
own
name
will
doubtless
come
up
in
the
course
of
general
chitchat
over
the
teacups
my
name
spiller
and
this
is
my
study
psmith
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
put
up
his
eyeglass
and
harangued
spiller
in
a
philosophical
vein
of
all
sad
words
of
tongue
or
pen
said
he
the
saddest
are
these
might
have
been
too
late
that
is
the
bitter
cry
if
you
had
torn
yourself
from
the
bosom
of
the
spiller
family
by
an
earlier
train
all
might
have
been
well
but
no
your
father
held
your
hand
and
said
huskily
do
leave
us
your
mother
clung
to
you
weeping
and
said
stay
your
sisters
i
want
to
know
what
your
sisters
froze
on
to
your
knees
like
little
octopuses
or
octopi
and
screamed
go
edwin
and
so
said
psmith
deeply
affected
by
his
recital
you
stayed
on
till
the
later
train
and
on
arrival
you
find
strange
faces
in
the
familiar
room
a
people
that
know
not
spiller
psmith
went
to
the
table
and
cheered
himself
with
a
sip
of
tea
spiller
sad
case
had
moved
him
greatly
the
victim
of
fate
seemed
in
no
way
consoled
it
beastly
cheek
that
what
i
call
it
are
you
new
chaps
the
very
latest
thing
said
psmith
well
it
beastly
cheek
mike
outlook
on
life
was
of
the
solid
practical
order
he
went
straight
to
the
root
of
the
matter
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
asked
spiller
evaded
the
question
it
beastly
cheek
he
repeated
you
ca
go
about
the
place
bagging
studies
but
we
do
said
psmith
in
this
life
comrade
spiller
we
must
be
prepared
for
every
emergency
we
must
distinguish
between
the
unusual
and
the
impossible
it
is
unusual
for
people
to
go
about
the
place
bagging
studies
so
you
have
rashly
ordered
your
life
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
impossible
error
ah
spiller
spiller
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
look
here
i
tell
you
what
it
i
was
in
a
car
with
a
man
once
i
said
to
him
would
happen
if
you
trod
on
that
pedal
thing
instead
of
that
other
pedal
thing
he
said
could
one
the
foot
brake
and
the
other
the
accelerator
suppose
you
did
i
said
would
he
said
we
let
her
rip
so
he
stamped
on
the
accelerator
only
it
turned
out
to
be
the
foot
brake
after
all
and
we
stopped
dead
and
skidded
into
a
ditch
the
advice
i
give
to
every
young
man
starting
life
is
confuse
the
unusual
and
the
impossible
take
the
present
case
if
you
had
only
realized
the
possibility
of
somebody
someday
collaring
your
study
you
might
have
thought
out
dozens
of
sound
schemes
for
dealing
with
the
matter
as
it
is
you
are
unprepared
the
thing
comes
on
you
as
a
surprise
the
cry
goes
round
has
been
taken
unawares
he
can
not
cope
with
the
situation
ca
i
i
what
you
going
to
do
about
it
said
mike
all
i
know
is
i
going
to
have
it
it
was
simpson
last
term
and
simpson
left
and
i
next
on
the
house
list
so
of
course
my
study
but
what
steps
said
psmith
are
you
going
to
take
spiller
the
man
of
logic
we
know
but
what
of
spiller
the
man
of
action
how
do
you
intend
to
set
about
it
force
is
useless
i
was
saying
to
comrade
jackson
before
you
came
in
that
i
did
mind
betting
you
were
an
little
weed
and
you
an
little
weed
we
see
what
outwood
says
about
it
not
an
unsound
scheme
by
no
means
a
scaly
project
comrade
jackson
and
myself
were
about
to
interview
him
upon
another
point
we
may
as
well
all
go
together
the
trio
made
their
way
to
the
presence
spiller
pink
and
determined
mike
sullen
psmith
particularly
debonair
he
hummed
lightly
as
he
walked
and
now
and
then
pointed
out
to
spiller
objects
of
interest
by
the
wayside
outwood
received
them
with
the
motherly
warmth
which
was
evidently
the
leading
characteristic
of
his
normal
manner
ah
spiller
he
said
and
smith
and
jackson
i
am
glad
to
see
you
have
already
made
friends
spiller
sir
said
psmith
laying
a
hand
patronizingly
on
the
shoulder
a
proceeding
violently
resented
by
spiller
is
a
character
one
can
not
help
but
respect
his
nature
expands
before
one
like
some
beautiful
flower
outwood
received
this
eulogy
with
rather
a
startled
expression
and
gazed
at
the
object
of
the
tribute
in
a
surprised
way
er
quite
so
smith
quite
so
he
said
at
last
i
like
to
see
boys
in
my
house
friendly
toward
one
another
there
is
no
vice
in
spiller
pursued
psmith
earnestly
his
heart
is
the
heart
of
a
little
child
please
sir
burst
out
this
paragon
of
all
the
virtues
i
but
it
was
not
entirely
with
regard
to
spiller
that
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
sir
if
you
were
not
too
busy
not
at
all
smith
not
at
all
is
there
anything
please
sir
began
spiller
i
understand
sir
said
psmith
that
there
is
an
archaeological
society
in
the
school
outwood
eyes
sparkled
behind
their
it
was
a
disappointment
to
him
that
so
few
boys
seemed
to
wish
to
belong
to
his
chosen
band
cricket
and
football
games
that
left
him
cold
appeared
to
be
the
main
interest
in
their
lives
it
was
but
rarely
that
he
could
induce
new
boys
to
join
his
colleague
mr
downing
who
presided
over
the
school
fire
brigade
never
had
any
difficulty
in
finding
support
boys
came
readily
at
his
call
outwood
pondered
wistfully
on
this
at
times
not
knowing
that
the
fire
brigade
owed
its
support
to
the
fact
that
it
provided
its
lighthearted
members
with
perfectly
unparalleled
opportunities
for
ragging
while
his
own
band
though
small
was
in
the
main
earnest
yes
smith
he
said
yes
we
have
a
small
archaeological
society
i
er
in
a
measure
look
after
it
perhaps
you
would
care
to
become
a
member
please
sir
said
spiller
one
moment
spiller
do
you
want
to
join
smith
intensely
sir
archaeology
fascinates
me
a
grand
pursuit
sir
undoubtedly
smith
i
am
very
pleased
very
pleased
indeed
i
will
put
down
your
name
at
once
and
jackson
sir
jackson
too
outwood
beamed
i
am
delighted
most
delighted
this
is
capital
this
enthusiasm
is
most
capital
spiller
sir
said
psmith
sadly
i
have
been
unable
to
induce
to
join
oh
he
is
one
of
our
oldest
members
ah
said
psmith
tolerantly
that
accounts
for
it
please
sir
said
spiller
one
moment
spiller
we
shall
have
the
first
outing
of
the
term
on
saturday
we
intend
to
inspect
the
roman
camp
at
embury
hill
two
miles
from
the
school
we
shall
be
there
sir
capital
please
sir
said
spiller
one
moment
spiller
said
psmith
there
is
just
one
other
matter
if
you
could
spare
the
time
sir
certainly
smith
what
is
that
would
there
be
any
objection
to
jackson
and
myself
taking
simpson
old
study
by
all
means
smith
a
very
good
idea
yes
sir
it
would
give
us
a
place
where
we
could
work
quietly
in
the
evenings
quite
so
quite
so
thank
you
very
much
sir
we
will
move
our
things
in
thank
you
very
much
sir
said
mike
please
sir
shouted
spiller
are
i
to
have
it
i
next
on
the
list
sir
i
come
next
after
simpson
ca
i
have
it
i
afraid
i
have
already
promised
it
to
smith
spiller
you
should
have
spoken
before
but
sir
psmith
eyed
the
speaker
pityingly
this
tendency
to
delay
spiller
he
said
is
your
besetting
fault
correct
it
edwin
fight
against
it
he
turned
to
outwood
we
should
of
course
sir
always
be
glad
to
see
spiller
in
our
study
he
would
always
find
a
cheery
welcome
waiting
there
for
him
there
is
no
formality
between
ourselves
and
spiller
quite
so
an
excellent
arrangement
smith
i
like
this
spirit
of
comradeship
in
my
house
then
you
will
be
with
us
on
saturday
on
saturday
sir
all
this
sort
of
thing
spiller
said
psmith
as
they
closed
the
door
is
very
very
trying
for
a
man
of
culture
look
us
up
in
our
study
one
of
these
afternoons
guerrilla
warfare
there
are
few
pleasures
said
psmith
as
he
resumed
his
favorite
position
against
the
mantelpiece
and
surveyed
the
commandeered
study
with
the
pride
of
a
householder
keener
to
the
reflective
mind
than
sitting
under
one
own
rooftree
this
place
would
have
been
wasted
on
spiller
he
would
not
have
appreciated
it
properly
mike
was
finishing
his
tea
you
a
jolly
useful
chap
to
have
by
you
in
a
crisis
smith
he
said
with
approval
we
ought
to
have
known
each
other
before
the
loss
was
mine
said
psmith
courteously
we
will
now
with
your
permission
face
the
future
for
a
while
i
suppose
you
realize
that
we
are
now
to
a
certain
extent
up
against
it
spiller
hot
spanish
blood
is
not
going
to
sit
tight
and
do
nothing
under
a
blow
like
this
what
can
he
do
outwood
given
us
the
study
what
would
you
have
done
if
somebody
had
bagged
your
study
made
it
jolly
hot
for
them
so
will
comrade
spiller
i
take
it
that
he
will
collect
a
gang
and
make
an
offensive
movement
against
us
directly
he
can
to
all
appearances
we
are
in
a
fairly
tight
place
it
all
depends
on
how
big
comrade
gang
will
be
i
do
like
rows
but
i
prepared
to
take
on
a
reasonable
number
of
assailants
in
defense
of
the
home
mike
intimated
that
he
was
with
him
on
the
point
the
difficulty
is
though
he
said
about
when
we
leave
this
room
i
mean
we
all
right
while
we
stick
here
but
we
ca
stay
all
night
that
just
what
i
was
about
to
point
out
when
you
put
it
with
such
admirable
clearness
here
we
are
in
a
stronghold
they
can
only
get
at
us
through
the
door
and
we
can
lock
that
and
jam
a
chair
against
it
as
you
rightly
remark
jam
a
chair
against
it
but
what
of
the
nightfall
what
of
the
time
when
we
retire
to
our
dormitory
or
dormitories
i
say
if
we
in
separate
rooms
we
shall
be
in
the
cart
psmith
eyed
mike
with
approval
he
thinks
of
everything
you
the
man
comrade
jackson
to
conduct
an
affair
of
this
kind
such
foresight
such
resource
we
must
see
to
this
at
once
if
they
put
us
in
different
rooms
we
done
we
shall
be
destroyed
singly
in
the
watches
of
the
night
we
better
nip
down
to
the
matron
right
off
not
the
matron
comrade
outwood
is
the
man
we
are
as
sons
to
him
there
is
nothing
he
can
deny
us
i
afraid
we
are
quite
spoiling
his
afternoon
by
these
interruptions
but
we
must
rout
him
out
once
more
as
they
got
up
the
door
handle
rattled
again
and
this
time
there
followed
a
knocking
this
must
be
an
emissary
of
comrade
spiller
said
psmith
let
us
parley
with
the
man
mike
unlocked
the
door
a
youth
with
a
cheerful
rather
vacant
face
and
a
receding
chin
strolled
into
the
room
and
stood
giggling
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
just
came
up
to
have
a
look
at
you
he
explained
if
you
move
a
little
to
the
left
said
psmith
you
will
catch
the
effects
on
jackson
face
better
the
newcomer
giggled
with
renewed
vigor
are
you
the
chap
with
the
eyeglass
who
jaws
all
the
time
i
wear
an
eyeglass
said
psmith
as
to
the
rest
of
the
description
my
name
jellicoe
mine
is
psmith
one
of
the
shropshire
psmiths
the
object
on
the
skyline
is
comrade
jackson
old
spiller
giggled
jellicoe
is
cursing
you
like
anything
downstairs
you
chaps
do
you
mean
to
say
you
simply
bagged
his
study
he
making
no
end
of
a
row
about
it
spiller
fiery
nature
is
a
byword
said
psmith
what
he
going
to
do
asked
mike
in
his
practical
way
he
going
to
get
the
chaps
to
turn
you
out
as
i
suspected
sighed
psmith
as
one
mourning
over
the
frailty
of
human
nature
about
how
many
assistants
should
you
say
that
he
would
be
likely
to
bring
will
you
for
instance
join
the
glad
throng
me
no
fear
i
think
spiller
an
ass
there
nothing
like
a
common
thought
for
binding
people
together
think
spiller
an
ass
how
many
there
be
then
asked
mike
he
might
get
about
half
a
dozen
not
more
because
most
of
the
chaps
do
see
why
they
should
sweat
themselves
just
because
spiller
study
has
been
bagged
sturdy
common
sense
said
psmith
approvingly
seems
to
be
the
chief
virtue
of
the
sedleigh
character
we
shall
be
able
to
tackle
a
crowd
like
that
said
mike
the
only
thing
is
we
must
get
into
the
same
dormitory
this
is
where
comrade
jellicoe
knowledge
of
the
local
geography
will
come
in
useful
do
you
happen
to
know
of
any
snug
little
room
with
say
about
four
beds
in
it
how
many
dormitories
are
there
five
there
one
with
three
beds
in
it
only
it
belongs
to
three
chaps
i
believe
in
the
equal
distribution
of
property
we
will
go
to
comrade
outwood
and
stake
out
another
claim
outwood
received
them
even
more
beamingly
than
before
yes
smith
he
said
we
must
apologize
for
disturbing
you
sir
not
at
all
smith
not
at
all
i
like
the
boys
in
my
house
to
come
to
me
when
they
wish
for
my
advice
or
help
we
were
wondering
sir
if
you
would
have
any
objection
to
jackson
jellicoe
and
myself
sharing
the
dormitory
with
the
three
beds
in
it
a
very
warm
friendship
explained
psmith
patting
the
gurgling
jellicoe
kindly
on
the
shoulder
has
sprung
up
between
jackson
jellicoe
and
myself
you
make
friends
easily
smith
i
like
to
see
it
i
like
to
see
it
and
we
can
have
the
room
sir
certainly
certainly
tell
the
matron
as
you
go
down
and
now
said
psmith
as
they
returned
to
the
study
we
may
say
that
we
are
in
a
fairly
winning
position
a
vote
of
thanks
to
comrade
jellicoe
for
his
valuable
assistance
you
a
chap
said
jellicoe
the
handle
began
to
revolve
again
that
door
said
psmith
is
getting
a
perfect
incubus
it
cuts
into
one
leisure
cruelly
this
time
it
was
a
small
boy
they
told
me
to
come
up
and
tell
you
to
come
down
he
said
psmith
looked
at
him
searchingly
through
his
eyeglass
who
the
senior

our
compliments
and
say
that
we

but
shall
be
delighted
to
see
him
up
here
things
he
said
as
the
messenger
departed
are
beginning
to
move
better
leave
the
door
open
i
think
it
will
save
trouble
ah
come
in
comrade
spiller
what
can
we
do
for
you
spiller
advanced
into
the
study
the
others
waited
outside
crowding
in
the
doorway
look
here
said
spiller
are
you
going
to
clear
out
of
here
or
not
after
outwood
kindly
thought
in
giving
us
the
room
you
suggest
a
black
and
ungrateful
action
comrade
spiller
you
get
it
hot
if
you
do
we
risk
it
said
mike
jellicoe
giggled
in
the
background
the
drama
in
the
atmosphere
appealed
to
him
his
was
a
simple
and
appreciative
mind
come
on
you
chaps
cried
spiller
suddenly
there
was
an
inward
rush
on
the
enemy
part
but
mike
had
been
watching
he
grabbed
spiller
by
the
shoulders
and
ran
him
back
against
the
advancing
crowd
for
a
moment
the
doorway
was
blocked
then
the
weight
and
impetus
of
mike
and
spiller
prevailed
the
enemy
gave
back
and
mike
stepping
into
the
room
again
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
a
neat
piece
of
work
said
psmith
approvingly
adjusting
his
tie
at
the
looking
glass
the
preliminaries
may
now
be
considered
over
the
first
shot
has
been
fired
the
dogs
of
war
are
now
loose
a
heavy
body
crashed
against
the
door
they
have
it
down
said
jellicoe
we
must
act
comrade
jackson
might
i
trouble
you
just
to
turn
that
key
quietly
and
the
handle
and
then
to
stand
by
for
the
next
attack
there
was
a
scrambling
of
feet
in
the
passage
outside
and
then
a
repetition
of
the
onslaught
on
the
door
this
time
however
the
door
instead
of
resisting
swung
open
and
the
human
battering
ram
staggered
through
into
the
study
mike
turning
after
relocking
the
door
was
just
in
time
to
see
psmith
with
a
display
of
energy
of
which
one
would
not
have
believed
him
capable
grip
the
invader
scientifically
by
an
arm
and
a
leg
mike
jumped
to
help
but
it
was
needless
the
captive
was
already
on
the
windowsill
as
mike
arrived
psmith
dropped
him
onto
the
flowerbed
below
psmith
closed
the
window
gently
and
turned
to
jellicoe
who
was
our
guest
he
asked
dusting
the
knees
of
his
trousers
where
they
had
pressed
against
the
wall
robinson
i
say
you
a
chap
robinson
was
it
well
we
are
always
glad
to
see
comrade
robinson
always
i
wonder
if
anybody
else
is
thinking
of
calling
apparently
frontal
attack
had
been
abandoned
whisperings
could
be
heard
in
the
corridor
somebody
hammered
on
the
door
yes
called
psmith
patiently
you
better
come
out
you
know
you
only
get
it
hotter
if
you
do
leave
us
spiller
we
would
be
alone
a
bell
rang
in
the
distance
tea
said
jellicoe
we
shall
have
to
go
now
they
wo
do
anything
till
after
tea
i
should
think
said
mike
there
no
harm
in
going
out
the
passage
was
empty
when
they
opened
the
door
the
call
to
food
was
evidently
a
thing
not
to
be
treated
lightly
by
the
enemy
in
the
dining
room
the
beleaguered
garrison
were
the
object
of
general
attention
everybody
turned
to
look
at
them
as
they
came
in
it
was
plain
that
the
study
episode
had
been
a
topic
of
conversation
face
was
crimson
and
robinson
coat
sleeve
still
bore
traces
of
garden
mold
mike
felt
rather
conscious
of
the
eyes
but
psmith
was
in
his
element
his
demeanor
throughout
the
meal
was
that
of
some
whimsical
monarch
condescending
for
a
freak
to
revel
with
his
humble
subjects
toward
the
end
of
the
meal
psmith
scribbled
a
note
and
passed
it
to
mike
it
read
directly
this
is
over
nip
upstairs
as
quickly
as
you
can
mike
followed
the
advice
they
were
first
out
of
the
room
when
they
had
been
in
the
study
a
few
moments
jellicoe
knocked
at
the
door
lucky
you
two
cut
away
so
quick
he
said
they
were
going
to
try
and
get
you
into
the
senior
day
room
and
scrag
you
there
this
said
psmith
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
is
exciting
but
it
ca
go
on
we
have
got
for
our
sins
to
be
in
this
place
for
a
whole
term
and
if
we
are
going
to
do
the
hunted
fawn
business
all
the
time
life
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
will
become
an
impossibility
my
nerves
are
so
delicately
attuned
that
the
strain
would
simply
reduce
them
to
hash
we
are
not
prepared
to
carry
on
a
long
campaign
the
thing
must
be
settled
at
once
shall
we
go
down
to
the
senior
day
room
and
have
it
out
said
mike
no
we
will
play
the
fixture
on
our
own
ground
i
think
we
may
take
it
as
tolerably
certain
that
comrade
spiller
and
his
hired
ruffians
will
try
to
corner
us
in
the
dormitory
tonight
well
of
course
we
could
fake
up
some
sort
of
barricade
for
the
door
but
then
we
should
have
all
the
trouble
over
again
tomorrow
and
the
day
after
that
personally
i
do
propose
to
be
chivied
about
indefinitely
like
this
so
i
propose
that
we
let
them
come
into
the
dormitory
and
see
what
happens
is
this
meeting
with
me
i
think
that
sound
said
mike
we
need
drag
jellicoe
into
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
do
mind
began
that
man
of
peace
quite
right
said
psmith
this
is
not
comrade
jellicoe
scene
at
all
he
has
got
to
spend
the
term
in
the
senior
day
room
whereas
we
have
our
little
wooden
to
retire
to
in
times
of
stress
comrade
jellicoe
must
stand
out
of
the
game
altogether
we
shall
be
glad
of
his
moral
support
but
otherwise
and
now
as
there
wo
be
anything
doing
till
bedtime
i
think
i
collar
this
table
and
write
home
and
tell
my
people
that
all
is
well
with
their
rupert
unpleasantness
in
the
small
hours
jellicoe
that
human
encyclopedia
consulted
on
the
probable
movements
of
the
enemy
deposed
that
spiller
retiring
at
ten
would
make
for
dormitory
one
in
the
same
passage
where
robinson
also
had
a
bed
the
rest
of
the
opposing
forces
were
distributed
among
other
and
more
distant
rooms
it
was
probable
therefore
that
dormitory
one
would
be
the
rendezvous
as
to
the
time
when
an
attack
might
be
expected
it
was
unlikely
that
it
would
occur
before
half
past
eleven
outwood
went
the
round
of
the
dormitories
at
eleven
and
touching
said
psmith
the
matter
of
noise
must
this
business
be
conducted
in
a
subdued
and
manner
or
may
we
let
ourselves
go
a
bit
here
and
there
i
should
think
old
outwood
likely
to
hear
you
he
sleeps
miles
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
he
never
hears
anything
we
often
rag
half
the
night
and
nothing
happens
this
appears
to
be
a
thoroughly
nice
establishment
what
would
my
mother
say
if
she
could
see
her
rupert
in
the
midst
of
these
reckless
youths
all
the
better
said
mike
we
do
want
anybody
butting
in
and
stopping
the
show
before
it
half
started
comrade
jackson
berserk
blood
is
up
i
can
hear
it
sizzling
i
quite
agree
these
things
are
all
very
disturbing
and
painful
but
it
as
well
to
do
them
thoroughly
when
one
once
in
for
them
is
there
nobody
else
who
might
interfere
with
our
gambols
barnes
might
said
jellicoe
only
he
wo
who
is
barnes
head
of
the
house
a
rotter
he
in
a
funk
of
stone
and
robinson
they
rag
him
he
simply
sit
tight
then
i
think
said
psmith
placidly
we
may
look
forward
to
a
very
pleasant
evening
shall
we
be
moving
outwood
paid
his
visit
at
eleven
as
predicted
by
jellicoe
beaming
vaguely
into
the
darkness
over
a
torch
and
disappeared
again
closing
the
door
how
about
that
door
said
mike
shall
we
leave
it
open
for
them
not
so
but
far
otherwise
if
it
shut
we
shall
hear
them
at
it
when
they
come
subject
to
your
approval
comrade
jackson
i
have
evolved
the
following
plan
of
action
i
always
ask
myself
on
these
occasions
would
napoleon
have
done
i
think
napoleon
would
have
sat
in
a
chair
by
his
washhand
stand
which
is
close
to
the
door
he
would
have
posted
you
by
your
washhand
stand
and
he
would
have
instructed
comrade
jellicoe
directly
he
heard
the
door
handle
turned
to
give
his
celebrated
imitation
of
a
dormitory
breathing
heavily
in
its
sleep
he
would
then
i
tell
you
what
said
mike
how
about
tying
a
string
at
the
top
of
the
steps
yes
napoleon
would
have
done
that
too
hats
off
to
comrade
jackson
the
man
with
the
big
brain
the
floor
of
the
dormitory
was
below
the
level
of
the
door
there
were
three
steps
leading
down
to
it
psmith
switched
on
his
torch
and
they
examined
the
ground
the
leg
of
a
wardrobe
and
the
leg
of
jellicoe
bed
made
it
possible
for
the
string
to
be
fastened
in
a
satisfactory
manner
across
the
lower
step
psmith
surveyed
the
result
with
approval
dashed
neat
he
said
practically
the
sunken
road
which
dished
the
cuirassiers
at
waterloo
i
seem
to
see
comrade
spiller
coming
one
of
the
finest
purlers
in
the
world
history
if
they
got
a
torch
they
wo
have
if
they
have
stand
by
and
grab
it
at
once
then
they
charge
forward
and
all
will
be
well
if
they
have
no
light
fire
into
the
brown
with
a
jug
of
water
lest
we
forget
i
collar
comrade
jellicoe
jug
now
and
keep
it
handy
a
couple
of
sheets
would
also
not
be
amiss
we
will
enmesh
the
enemy
right
ho
said
mike
these
humane
preparations
being
concluded
said
psmith
we
will
retire
to
our
posts
and
wait
comrade
jellicoe
do
forget
to
breathe
like
an
asthmatic
sheep
when
you
hear
the
door
opened
they
may
wait
at
the
top
of
the
steps
listening
you
a
lad
said
jellicoe
waiting
in
the
dark
for
something
to
happen
is
always
a
trying
experience
especially
if
as
on
this
occasion
silence
is
essential
mike
was
tired
after
his
journey
and
he
had
begun
to
doze
when
he
was
jerked
back
to
wakefulness
by
the
stealthy
turning
of
the
door
handle
the
faintest
rustle
from
psmith
direction
followed
and
a
slight
giggle
succeeded
by
a
series
of
deep
breaths
showed
that
jellicoe
too
had
heard
the
noise
there
was
a
creaking
sound
it
was
in
the
dormitory
but
mike
could
follow
the
movements
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
been
broad
daylight
they
had
opened
the
door
and
were
listening
jellicoe
breathing
grew
more
asthmatic
he
was
flinging
himself
into
his
part
with
the
wholeheartedness
of
the
true
artist
the
creak
was
followed
by
a
sound
of
whispering
then
another
creak
the
enemy
had
advanced
to
the
top
step
another
creak
the
vanguard
had
reached
the
second
step
in
another
moment
crash
and
at
that
point
the
proceedings
may
be
said
to
have
formally
opened
a
struggling
mass
bumped
against
mike
shins
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
he
emptied
his
jug
onto
this
mass
and
a
yell
of
anguish
showed
that
the
contents
had
got
to
the
right
address
then
a
hand
grabbed
his
ankle
and
he
went
down
a
million
sparks
dancing
before
his
eyes
as
a
fist
flying
out
at
a
venture
caught
him
on
the
nose
mike
had
not
been
well
disposed
toward
the
invaders
before
but
now
he
ran
amok
hitting
out
right
and
left
at
random
his
right
missed
but
his
left
went
home
hard
on
some
portion
of
somebody
anatomy
a
kick
freed
his
ankle
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
at
the
same
moment
a
sudden
increase
in
the
general
volume
of
noise
spoke
eloquently
of
good
work
that
was
being
put
in
by
psmith
even
at
that
crisis
mike
could
not
help
feeling
that
if
a
row
of
this
caliber
did
not
draw
outwood
from
his
bed
he
must
be
an
unusual
kind
of
housemaster
he
plunged
forward
again
with
outstretched
arms
and
stumbled
and
fell
over
one
of
the
section
of
the
opposing
force
they
seized
each
other
earnestly
and
rolled
across
the
room
till
mike
contriving
to
secure
his
adversary
head
bumped
it
on
the
floor
with
such
abandon
that
with
a
muffled
yell
the
other
let
go
and
for
the
second
time
he
rose
as
he
did
so
he
was
conscious
of
a
curious
thudding
sound
that
made
itself
heard
through
the
other
assorted
noises
of
the
battle
all
this
time
the
fight
had
gone
on
in
the
blackest
darkness
but
now
a
light
shone
on
the
proceedings
interested
occupants
of
other
dormitories
roused
from
their
slumbers
had
come
to
observe
the
sport
they
had
switched
on
the
light
and
were
crowding
in
the
doorway
by
the
light
of
this
mike
got
a
swift
view
of
the
theater
of
war
the
enemy
appeared
to
number
five
the
warrior
whose
head
mike
had
bumped
on
the
floor
was
robinson
who
was
sitting
up
feeling
his
skull
in
a
gingerly
fashion
to
mike
right
almost
touching
him
was
stone
in
the
direction
of
the
door
psmith
wielding
in
his
right
hand
the
cord
of
a
dressing
gown
was
engaging
the
remaining
three
with
a
patient
smile
they
were
clad
in
pajamas
and
appeared
to
be
feeling
the
cord
acutely
the
sudden
light
dazed
both
sides
momentarily
the
defense
was
the
first
to
recover
mike
with
a
swing
upsetting
stone
and
psmith
having
seized
and
emptied
jellicoe
jug
over
spiller
getting
to
work
again
with
the
cord
in
a
manner
that
roused
the
utmost
enthusiasm
of
the
spectators
agility
seemed
to
be
the
leading
feature
of
psmith
tactics
he
was
everywhere
on
mike
bed
on
his
own
on
jellicoe
drawing
a
passionate
complaint
from
that
noncombatant
on
whose
face
he
inadvertently
trod
on
the
floor
he
ranged
the
room
sowing
destruction
the
enemy
were
disheartened
they
had
started
with
the
idea
that
this
was
to
be
a
surprise
attack
and
it
was
disconcerting
to
find
the
garrison
armed
at
all
points
gradually
they
edged
to
the
door
and
a
final
rush
sent
them
through
hold
the
door
for
a
second
cried
psmith
and
vanished
mike
was
alone
in
the
doorway
it
was
a
situation
which
exactly
suited
his
frame
of
mind
he
stood
alone
in
direct
opposition
to
the
community
into
which
fate
had
pitchforked
him
so
abruptly
he
liked
the
feeling
for
the
first
time
since
his
father
had
given
him
his
views
upon
school
reports
that
morning
in
the
easter
holidays
he
felt
satisfied
with
life
he
hoped
outnumbered
as
he
was
that
the
enemy
would
come
on
again
and
not
give
the
thing
up
in
disgust
he
wanted
more
on
an
occasion
like
this
there
is
rarely
anything
approaching
concerted
action
on
the
part
of
the
aggressors
when
the
attack
came
it
was
not
a
combined
attack
stone
who
was
nearest
to
the
door
made
a
sudden
dash
forward
and
mike
hit
him
under
the
chin
stone
drew
back
and
there
was
another
interval
for
rest
and
reflection
it
was
interrupted
by
the
reappearance
of
psmith
who
strolled
back
along
the
passage
swinging
his
cord
as
if
it
were
some
clouded
cane
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
comrade
jackson
he
said
politely
duty
called
me
elsewhere
with
the
kindly
aid
of
a
guide
who
knows
the
lie
of
the
land
i
have
been
making
a
short
tour
of
the
dormitories
i
have
poured
divers
jugfuls
of
water
over
comrade
spiller
bed
comrade
robinson
bed
comrade
stone
spiller
spiller
these
are
harsh
words
where
you
pick
them
up
i
ca
think
not
from
me
well
well
i
suppose
there
must
be
an
end
to
the
pleasantest
of
functions
good
night
good
night
the
door
closed
behind
mike
and
himself
for
ten
minutes
shufflings
and
whisperings
went
on
in
the
corridor
but
nobody
touched
the
handle
then
there
was
a
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
and
silence
reigned
on
the
following
morning
there
was
a
notice
on
the
house
board
it
ran
indoor
games
raiders
are
informed
that
in
future
neither
psmith
nor
jackson
will
be
at
home
to
visitors
this
nuisance
must
now
psmith
jackson
adair
on
the
same
morning
mike
met
adair
for
the
first
time
he
was
going
across
to
school
with
psmith
and
jellicoe
when
a
group
of
three
came
out
of
the
gate
of
the
house
next
door
that
adair
said
jellicoe
in
the
middle
his
voice
had
assumed
a
tone
almost
of
awe
who
adair
asked
mike
captain
of
cricket
and
lots
of
other
things
mike
could
only
see
the
celebrity
back
he
had
broad
shoulders
and
wiry
light
hair
almost
white
he
walked
well
as
if
he
were
used
to
running
altogether
a
sort
of
man
even
mike
jaundiced
eye
saw
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
adair
deserved
more
than
a
casual
glance
he
was
that
rare
type
the
natural
leader
many
boys
and
men
if
accident
or
the
passage
of
time
places
them
in
a
position
where
they
are
expected
to
lead
can
handle
the
job
without
disaster
but
that
is
a
very
different
thing
from
being
a
born
leader
adair
was
of
the
sort
that
comes
to
the
top
by
sheer
force
of
character
and
determination
he
was
not
naturally
clever
at
work
but
he
had
gone
at
it
with
a
dogged
resolution
which
had
carried
him
up
the
school
and
landed
him
high
in
the
sixth
as
a
cricketer
he
was
almost
entirely
nature
had
given
him
a
good
eye
and
left
the
thing
at
that
adair
doggedness
had
triumphed
over
her
failure
to
do
her
work
thoroughly
at
the
cost
of
more
trouble
than
most
people
give
to
their
life
work
he
had
made
himself
into
a
bowler
he
read
the
authorities
and
watched
players
and
thought
the
thing
out
on
his
own
account
and
he
divided
the
art
of
bowling
into
three
sections
first
and
most
important
pitch
second
on
the
list
break
third
pace
he
set
himself
to
acquire
pitch
he
acquired
it
bowling
at
his
own
pace
and
without
any
attempt
at
break
he
could
now
drop
the
ball
on
an
envelope
seven
times
out
of
ten
break
was
a
more
uncertain
quantity
sometimes
he
could
get
it
at
the
expense
of
pitch
sometimes
at
the
expense
of
pace
some
days
he
could
get
all
three
and
then
he
was
an
uncommonly
bad
man
to
face
on
anything
but
a
plumb
wicket
running
he
had
acquired
in
a
similar
manner
he
had
nothing
approaching
style
but
he
had
twice
won
the
mile
and
half
mile
at
the
sports
off
elegant
runners
who
knew
all
about
stride
and
the
correct
timing
of
the
sprints
and
all
the
rest
of
it
briefly
he
was
a
worker
he
had
heart
a
boy
of
adair
type
is
always
a
force
in
a
school
in
a
big
public
school
or
six
or
seven
hundred
his
influence
is
felt
less
but
in
a
small
school
like
sedleigh
he
is
like
a
tidal
wave
sweeping
all
before
him
there
were
two
hundred
boys
at
sedleigh
and
there
was
not
one
of
them
in
all
probability
who
had
not
directly
or
indirectly
been
influenced
by
adair
as
a
small
boy
his
sphere
was
not
large
but
the
effects
of
his
work
began
to
be
apparent
even
then
it
is
human
nature
to
want
to
get
something
which
somebody
else
obviously
values
very
much
and
when
it
was
observed
by
members
of
his
form
that
adair
was
going
to
great
trouble
and
inconvenience
to
secure
a
place
in
the
form
eleven
or
fifteen
they
naturally
began
to
think
too
that
it
was
worth
being
in
those
teams
the
consequence
was
that
his
form
always
played
hard
this
made
other
forms
play
hard
and
the
net
result
was
that
when
adair
succeeded
to
the
captaincy
of
rugger
and
cricket
in
the
same
year
sedleigh
as
mr
downing
adair
housemaster
and
the
nearest
approach
to
a
cricket
master
that
sedleigh
possessed
had
a
fondness
for
saying
was
a
keen
school
as
a
whole
it
both
worked
and
played
with
energy
all
it
wanted
now
was
opportunity
this
adair
was
determined
to
give
it
he
had
that
passionate
fondness
for
his
school
which
every
boy
is
popularly
supposed
to
have
but
which
really
is
implanted
in
about
one
in
every
thousand
the
average
boy
his
school
he
hopes
it
will
lick
bedford
at
rugger
and
malvern
at
cricket
but
he
rather
bets
it
wo
he
is
sorry
to
leave
and
he
likes
going
back
at
the
end
of
the
holidays
but
as
for
any
passionate
love
of
the
place
he
would
think
it
rather
bad
form
than
otherwise
if
anybody
came
up
to
him
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
cried
come
along
jenkins
my
boy
play
up
for
the
old
school
jenkins
the
dear
old
school
the
old
place
you
love
so
he
would
feel
seriously
adair
was
the
exception
to
adair
sedleigh
was
almost
a
religion
both
his
parents
were
dead
his
guardian
with
whom
he
spent
the
holidays
was
a
man
with
neuralgia
at
one
end
of
him
and
gout
at
the
other
and
the
only
really
pleasant
times
adair
had
had
as
far
back
as
he
could
remember
he
owed
to
sedleigh
the
place
had
grown
on
him
absorbed
him
where
mike
violently
transplanted
from
wrykyn
saw
only
a
wretched
little
hole
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
wrykyn
adair
dreaming
of
the
future
saw
a
colossal
establishment
a
public
school
among
public
schools
a
lump
of
human
radium
shooting
out
blues
and
balliol
scholars
year
after
year
without
ceasing
it
would
not
be
so
till
long
after
he
was
gone
and
forgotten
but
he
did
not
mind
that
his
devotion
to
sedleigh
was
purely
unselfish
he
did
not
want
fame
all
he
worked
for
was
that
the
school
should
grow
and
grow
keener
and
better
at
games
and
more
prosperous
year
by
year
till
it
should
take
its
rank
among
schools
and
to
be
an
old
sedleighan
should
be
a
badge
passing
its
owner
everywhere
he
captain
of
cricket
and
rugger
said
jellicoe
impressively
in
the
shooting
eight
he
won
the
mile
and
half
mile
two
years
running
he
would
have
boxed
at
aldershot
last
term
only
he
sprained
his
wrist
and
he
plays
fives
jolly
well
sort
of
little
tin
god
said
mike
taking
a
violent
dislike
to
adair
from
that
moment
mike
actual
acquaintance
with
this
man
dated
from
the
dinner
hour
that
day
mike
was
walking
to
the
house
with
psmith
psmith
was
a
little
ruffled
on
account
of
a
slight
he
had
had
with
his
form
master
during
morning
school
a
p
before
the
smith
i
said
to
him
smith
i
see
replied
the
goat
peasmith
i
replied
exercising
wonderful
psmith
it
took
me
ten
minutes
to
drive
the
thing
into
the
man
head
and
when
i
driven
it
in
he
sent
me
out
of
the
room
for
looking
at
him
through
my
eyeglass
comrade
jackson
i
fear
me
we
have
fallen
among
bad
men
i
suspect
that
we
are
going
to
be
much
persecuted
by
scoundrels
both
you
chaps
play
cricket
i
suppose
they
turned
it
was
adair
seeing
him
face
to
face
mike
was
aware
of
a
pair
of
very
bright
blue
eyes
and
a
square
jaw
in
any
other
place
and
mood
he
would
have
liked
adair
at
sight
his
prejudice
however
against
all
things
sedleighan
was
too
much
for
him
i
do
he
said
shortly
have
you
played
my
little
sister
and
i
sometimes
play
with
a
soft
ball
at
home
adair
looked
sharply
at
him
a
temper
was
evidently
one
of
his
numerous
qualities
oh
he
said
well
perhaps
you
would
mind
turning
out
this
afternoon
and
seeing
what
you
can
do
with
a
hard
ball
if
you
can
manage
without
your
little
sister
i
should
think
the
form
at
this
place
would
be
about
on
a
level
with
hers
but
i
do
happen
to
be
playing
cricket
as
i
think
i
told
you
adair
jaw
grew
squarer
than
ever
mike
was
wearing
a
gloomy
scowl
psmith
joined
suavely
in
the
dialogue
my
dear
old
comrades
he
said
do
let
us
brawl
over
this
matter
this
is
a
time
for
the
honeyed
word
the
kindly
eye
and
the
pleasant
smile
let
me
explain
to
comrade
adair
speaking
for
comrade
jackson
and
myself
we
should
both
be
delighted
to
join
in
the
mimic
warfare
of
our
national
game
as
you
suggest
only
the
fact
is
we
happen
to
be
the
young
archaeologists
we
gave
in
our
names
last
night
when
you
are
being
carried
back
to
the
pavilion
after
your
century
against
loamshire
do
you
play
loamshire
we
shall
be
grubbing
in
the
hard
ground
for
ruined
abbeys
the
old
choice
between
pleasure
and
duty
comrade
adair
a
boy
crossroads
then
you
wo
play
no
said
mike
archaeology
said
psmith
with
a
deprecatory
wave
of
the
hand
will
brook
no
divided
allegiance
from
her
devotees
adair
turned
and
walked
on
scarcely
had
he
gone
when
another
voice
hailed
them
with
precisely
the
same
question
both
you
fellows
are
going
to
play
cricket
eh
it
was
a
master
a
short
wiry
little
man
with
a
sharp
nose
and
a
general
resemblance
both
in
manner
and
appearance
to
an
excitable
bullfinch
i
saw
adair
speaking
to
you
i
suppose
you
will
both
play
i
like
every
new
boy
to
begin
at
once
the
more
new
blood
we
have
the
better
we
want
keenness
here
we
are
above
all
a
keen
school
i
want
every
boy
to
be
keen
we
are
sir
said
psmith
with
fervor
excellent
on
archaeology
mr
downing
for
it
was
no
less
a
celebrity
started
as
one
who
perceives
a
loathly
caterpillar
in
his
salad
archaeology
we
gave
in
our
names
to
outwood
last
night
sir
archaeology
is
a
passion
with
us
sir
when
we
heard
that
there
was
a
society
here
we
went
singing
about
the
house
i
call
it
an
unnatural
pursuit
for
boys
said
mr
downing
vehemently
i
do
like
it
i
tell
you
i
do
like
it
it
is
not
for
me
to
interfere
with
one
of
my
colleagues
on
the
staff
but
i
tell
you
frankly
that
in
my
opinion
it
is
an
abominable
waste
of
time
for
a
boy
it
gets
him
into
idle
loafing
habits
i
never
loaf
sir
said
psmith
i
was
not
alluding
to
you
in
particular
i
was
referring
to
the
principle
of
the
thing
a
boy
ought
to
be
playing
cricket
with
other
boys
not
wandering
at
large
about
the
country
probably
smoking
and
going
into
low
public
houses
a
very
wild
lot
sir
i
fear
the
archaeological
society
here
sighed
psmith
shaking
his
head
if
you
choose
to
waste
your
time
i
suppose
i
ca
hinder
you
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
foolery
nothing
else
he
stumped
off
now
cross
said
psmith
looking
after
him
i
afraid
getting
ourselves
disliked
here
good
job
too
at
any
rate
comrade
outwood
loves
us
let
go
on
and
see
what
sort
of
a
lunch
that
fossil
fancier
is
going
to
give
us
mike
finds
occupation
there
was
more
than
one
moment
during
the
first
fortnight
of
term
when
mike
found
himself
regretting
the
attitude
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
with
regard
to
sedleighan
cricket
he
began
to
realize
the
eternal
truth
of
the
proverb
about
half
a
loaf
and
no
bread
in
the
first
flush
of
his
resentment
against
his
new
surroundings
he
had
refused
to
play
cricket
and
now
he
positively
ached
for
a
game
any
sort
of
a
game
an
innings
for
a
kindergarten
the
second
eleven
of
a
home
of
rest
for
centenarians
would
have
soothed
him
there
were
times
when
the
sun
shone
and
he
caught
sight
of
white
flannels
on
a
green
ground
and
heard
the
plonk
of
bat
striking
ball
when
he
felt
like
rushing
to
adair
and
shouting
i
be
good
i
was
in
the
wrykyn
team
three
years
and
had
an
average
of
over
fifty
the
last
two
seasons
lead
me
to
the
nearest
net
and
let
me
feel
a
bat
in
my
hands
again
but
every
time
he
shrank
from
such
a
climb
down
it
could
be
done
what
made
it
worse
was
that
he
saw
after
watching
behind
the
nets
once
or
twice
that
sedleigh
cricket
was
not
the
childish
burlesque
of
the
game
which
he
had
been
rash
enough
to
assume
that
it
must
be
numbers
do
not
make
good
cricket
they
only
make
the
presence
of
good
cricketers
more
likely
by
the
law
of
averages
mike
soon
saw
that
cricket
was
by
no
means
an
unknown
art
at
sedleigh
adair
to
begin
with
was
a
very
good
bowler
indeed
he
was
not
a
burgess
but
burgess
was
the
only
wrykyn
bowler
whom
in
his
three
years
experience
of
the
school
mike
would
have
placed
above
him
he
was
a
long
way
better
than
and
wyatt
and
milton
and
the
others
who
had
taken
wickets
for
wrykyn
the
batting
was
not
so
good
but
there
were
some
quite
capable
men
barnes
the
head
of
outwood
he
who
preferred
not
to
interfere
with
stone
and
robinson
was
a
mild
rather
youth
not
unlike
what
outwood
must
have
been
as
a
boy
but
he
knew
how
to
keep
balls
out
of
his
wicket
he
was
a
good
bat
of
the
old
plodding
type
stone
and
robinson
themselves
that
swashbuckling
pair
who
now
treated
mike
and
psmith
with
cold
but
consistent
politeness
were
both
fair
batsmen
and
stone
was
a
good
slow
bowler
there
were
other
exponents
of
the
game
mostly
in
downing
house
altogether
quite
worthy
colleagues
even
for
a
man
who
had
been
a
star
at
wrykyn
one
solitary
overture
mike
made
during
that
first
fortnight
he
did
not
repeat
the
experiment
it
was
on
a
thursday
afternoon
after
school
the
day
was
warm
but
freshened
by
an
almost
imperceptible
breeze
the
air
was
full
of
the
scent
of
the
cut
grass
which
lay
in
little
heaps
behind
the
nets
this
is
the
real
cricket
scent
which
calls
to
one
like
the
very
voice
of
the
game
mike
as
he
sat
there
watching
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
went
up
to
adair
may
i
have
an
innings
at
this
net
he
asked
he
was
embarrassed
and
nervous
and
was
trying
not
to
show
it
the
natural
result
was
that
his
manner
was
offensively
abrupt
adair
was
taking
off
his
pads
after
his
innings
he
looked
up
this
net
it
may
be
observed
was
the
first
eleven
net
what
he
said
mike
repeated
his
request
more
abruptly
this
time
from
increased
embarrassment
this
is
the
first
eleven
net
said
adair
coldly
go
in
after
lodge
over
there
over
there
was
the
end
net
where
frenzied
novices
were
bowling
on
a
corrugated
pitch
to
a
youth
with
enormous
feet
who
looked
as
if
he
were
taking
his
first
lesson
at
the
game
mike
walked
away
without
a
word
the
archaeological
society
expeditions
even
though
they
carried
with
them
the
privilege
of
listening
to
psmith
views
of
life
proved
but
a
poor
substitute
for
cricket
psmith
who
had
no
counterattraction
shouting
to
him
that
he
ought
to
be
elsewhere
seemed
to
enjoy
them
hugely
but
mike
almost
cried
sometimes
from
boredom
it
was
not
always
possible
to
slip
away
from
the
throng
for
outwood
evidently
looked
upon
them
as
among
the
very
faithful
and
kept
them
by
his
side
mike
on
these
occasions
was
silent
and
jumpy
his
brow
sicklied
with
the
pale
cast
of
care
but
psmith
followed
his
leader
with
the
pleased
and
indulgent
air
of
a
father
whose
infant
son
is
showing
him
round
the
garden
psmith
attitude
toward
archaeological
research
struck
a
new
note
in
the
history
of
that
neglected
science
he
was
amiable
but
patronizing
he
patronized
fossils
and
he
patronized
ruins
if
he
had
been
confronted
with
the
great
pyramid
he
would
have
patronized
that
he
seemed
to
be
consumed
by
a
thirst
for
knowledge
that
this
was
not
altogether
a
genuine
thirst
was
proved
in
the
third
expedition
outwood
and
his
band
were
pecking
away
at
the
site
of
an
old
roman
camp
psmith
approached
mike
having
inspired
confidence
he
said
by
the
docility
of
our
demeanor
let
us
slip
away
and
brood
apart
for
awhile
roman
camps
to
be
absolutely
accurate
give
me
the
pip
and
i
never
want
to
see
another
putrid
fossil
in
my
life
let
us
find
some
shady
nook
where
a
man
may
lie
on
his
back
for
a
bit
mike
over
whom
the
proceedings
connected
with
the
roman
camp
had
long
since
begun
to
shed
a
blue
depression
offered
no
opposition
and
they
strolled
away
down
the
hill
looking
back
they
saw
that
the
archaeologists
were
still
hard
at
it
their
departure
had
passed
unnoticed
a
fatiguing
pursuit
this
grubbing
for
mementos
of
the
past
said
psmith
and
above
all
dashed
bad
for
the
knees
of
the
trousers
mine
are
like
some
furrowed
field
it
a
great
grief
to
a
man
of
refinement
i
can
tell
you
comrade
jackson
ah
this
looks
a
likely
spot
they
had
passed
through
a
gate
into
the
field
beyond
at
the
farther
end
there
was
a
brook
shaded
by
trees
and
running
with
a
pleasant
sound
over
pebbles
thus
far
said
psmith
hitching
up
the
knees
of
his
trousers
and
sitting
down
and
no
farther
we
will
rest
here
awhile
and
listen
to
the
music
of
the
brook
in
fact
unless
you
have
anything
important
to
say
i
rather
think
i
go
to
sleep
in
this
busy
life
of
ours
these
naps
by
the
wayside
are
invaluable
call
me
in
about
an
hour
and
psmith
heaving
the
comfortable
sigh
of
the
worker
who
by
toil
has
earned
rest
lay
down
with
his
head
against
a
mossy
tree
stump
and
closed
his
eyes
mike
sat
on
for
a
few
minutes
listening
to
the
water
and
making
centuries
in
his
mind
and
then
finding
this
a
little
dull
he
got
up
jumped
the
brook
and
began
to
explore
the
wood
on
the
other
side
he
had
not
gone
many
yards
when
a
dog
emerged
suddenly
from
the
undergrowth
and
began
to
bark
vigorously
at
him
mike
liked
dogs
and
on
acquaintance
they
always
liked
him
but
when
you
meet
a
dog
in
someone
else
wood
it
is
as
well
not
to
stop
in
order
that
you
may
get
to
understand
each
other
mike
began
to
thread
his
way
back
through
the
trees
he
was
too
late
stop
what
the
dickens
are
you
doing
here
shouted
a
voice
behind
him
in
the
same
situation
a
few
years
before
mike
would
have
carried
on
and
trusted
to
speed
to
save
him
but
now
there
seemed
a
lack
of
dignity
in
the
action
he
came
back
to
where
the
man
was
standing
i
sorry
if
i
trespassing
he
said
i
was
just
having
a
look
round
the
dickens
you
why
you
jackson
mike
looked
at
him
he
was
a
short
broad
young
man
with
a
fair
moustache
mike
knew
that
he
had
seen
him
before
somewhere
but
he
could
not
place
him
i
played
against
you
for
the
free
foresters
last
summer
in
passing
you
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
a
free
forester
yourself
dancing
in
among
my
nesting
pheasants
i
frightfully
sorry
that
all
right
where
do
you
spring
from
of
course
i
remember
you
now
you
prendergast
you
made
not
out
thanks
i
was
afraid
the
only
thing
you
would
remember
about
me
was
that
you
took
a
century
mostly
off
my
bowling
you
ought
to
have
had
me
second
ball
only
cover
dropped
it
do
rake
up
forgotten
tragedies
how
is
it
you
not
at
wrykyn
what
are
you
doing
down
here
i
left
wrykyn
prendergast
suddenly
changed
the
conversation
when
a
fellow
tells
you
that
he
has
left
school
unexpectedly
it
is
not
always
tactful
to
inquire
the
reason
he
began
to
talk
about
himself
i
hang
out
down
here
i
do
a
little
farming
and
a
good
deal
of
puttering
about
get
any
cricket
asked
mike
turning
to
the
subject
next
his
heart
only
village
very
keen
but
no
great
shakes
by
the
way
how
are
you
off
for
cricket
now
have
you
ever
got
a
spare
afternoon
mike
heart
leaped
any
wednesday
or
saturday
look
here
i
tell
you
how
it
is
and
he
told
how
matters
stood
with
him
so
you
see
he
concluded
i
supposed
to
be
hunting
for
ruins
and
things
mike
ideas
on
the
subject
of
archaeology
were
vague
but
i
could
always
slip
away
we
all
start
out
together
but
i
could
nip
back
get
onto
my
bike
i
got
it
down
here
and
meet
you
anywhere
you
liked
by
jove
i
simply
dying
for
a
game
i
can
hardly
keep
my
hands
off
a
bat
i
give
you
all
you
want
what
you
better
do
is
to
ride
straight
to
lower
borlock
that
the
name
of
the
place
and
i
meet
you
on
the
ground
anyone
will
tell
you
where
lower
borlock
is
it
just
off
the
london
road
there
a
signpost
where
you
turn
off
can
you
come
next
saturday
rather
i
suppose
you
can
fix
me
up
with
a
bat
and
pads
i
do
want
to
bring
mine
i
lend
you
everything
i
say
you
know
we
ca
give
you
a
wrykyn
wicket
the
lower
borlock
pitch
is
a
shirt
front
i
play
on
a
rockery
if
you
want
me
to
said
mike
you
going
to
what
asked
psmith
sleepily
on
being
awakened
and
told
the
news
i
going
to
play
cricket
for
a
village
near
here
i
say
do
tell
a
soul
will
you
i
do
want
it
to
get
about
or
i
may
get
lugged
in
to
play
for
the
school
my
lips
are
sealed
i
think
i
come
and
watch
you
cricket
i
dislike
but
watching
cricket
is
one
of
the
finest
of
britain
manly
sports
i
borrow
jellicoe
bicycle
that
saturday
lower
borlock
smote
the
men
of
chidford
hip
and
thigh
their
victory
was
due
to
a
hurricane
innings
of
by
a
newcomer
to
the
team
jackson
the
fire
brigade
meeting
cricket
is
the
great
safety
valve
if
you
like
the
game
and
are
in
a
position
to
play
it
at
least
twice
a
week
life
can
never
be
entirely
gray
as
time
went
on
and
his
average
for
lower
borlock
reached
the
fifties
and
stayed
there
mike
began
though
he
would
not
have
admitted
it
to
enjoy
himself
it
was
not
wrykyn
but
it
was
a
very
decent
substitute
the
only
really
considerable
element
making
for
discomfort
now
was
mr
downing
by
bad
luck
it
was
in
his
form
that
mike
had
been
placed
on
arrival
and
mr
downing
never
an
easy
form
master
to
get
on
with
proved
more
than
usually
difficult
in
his
dealings
with
mike
they
had
taken
a
dislike
to
each
other
at
their
first
meeting
and
it
grew
with
further
acquaintance
to
mike
mr
downing
was
all
that
a
master
ought
not
to
be
fussy
pompous
and
openly
influenced
in
his
official
dealings
with
his
form
by
his
own
private
likes
and
dislikes
to
mr
downing
mike
was
simply
an
unamiable
loafer
who
did
nothing
for
the
school
and
apparently
had
none
of
the
healthy
instincts
which
should
be
implanted
in
the
healthy
boy
mr
downing
was
rather
strong
on
the
healthy
boy
the
two
lived
in
a
state
of
simmering
hostility
punctuated
at
intervals
by
crises
which
usually
resulted
in
lower
borlock
having
to
play
some
unskilled
laborer
in
place
of
their
star
batsman
employed
doing
overtime
one
of
the
most
acute
of
these
crises
and
the
most
important
in
that
it
was
the
direct
cause
of
mike
appearance
in
sedleigh
cricket
had
to
do
with
the
third
weekly
meeting
of
the
school
fire
brigade
it
may
be
remembered
that
this
institution
was
under
mr
downing
special
care
it
was
indeed
his
pet
hobby
and
the
apple
of
his
eye
just
as
you
had
to
join
the
archaeological
society
to
secure
the
esteem
of
outwood
so
to
become
a
member
of
the
fire
brigade
was
a
safe
passport
to
the
regard
of
mr
downing
to
show
a
keenness
for
cricket
was
good
but
to
join
the
fire
brigade
was
best
of
all
the
brigade
was
carefully
organized
at
its
head
was
mr
downing
a
sort
of
high
priest
under
him
was
a
captain
and
under
the
captain
a
these
two
officials
were
those
sportive
allies
stone
and
robinson
of
outwood
house
who
having
perceived
at
a
very
early
date
the
gorgeous
opportunities
for
ragging
which
the
brigade
offered
to
its
members
had
joined
young
and
worked
their
way
up
under
them
were
the
rank
and
file
about
thirty
in
all
of
whom
perhaps
seven
were
earnest
workers
who
looked
on
the
brigade
in
the
right
or
downing
spirit
the
rest
were
entirely
frivolous
the
weekly
meetings
were
always
full
of
life
and
excitement
at
this
point
it
is
as
well
to
introduce
sammy
to
the
reader
sammy
short
for
sampson
was
a
young
bull
terrier
belonging
to
mr
downing
if
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
have
two
apples
of
his
eye
sammy
was
the
other
he
was
a
large
lighthearted
dog
with
a
white
coat
an
engaging
expression
the
tongue
of
an
anteater
and
a
manner
which
was
a
happy
blend
of
hurricane
and
circular
saw
he
had
long
legs
a
tenor
voice
and
was
apparently
made
of
india
rubber
sammy
was
a
great
favorite
in
the
school
and
a
particular
friend
of
mike
the
wrykynian
being
always
a
firm
ally
of
every
dog
he
met
after
two
minutes
acquaintance
in
passing
jellicoe
owned
a
clockwork
rat
much
in
request
during
french
lessons
we
will
now
proceed
to
the
painful
details
the
meetings
of
the
fire
brigade
were
held
after
school
in
mr
form
room
the
proceedings
always
began
in
the
same
way
by
the
reading
of
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
after
that
the
entertainment
varied
according
to
whether
the
members
happened
to
be
fertile
or
not
in
ideas
for
the
disturbing
of
the
peace
today
they
were
in
very
fair
form
as
soon
as
mr
downing
had
closed
the
minute
book
wilson
of
the
school
house
held
up
his
hand
well
wilson
please
sir
could
we
have
a
uniform
for
the
brigade
a
uniform
mr
downing
pondered
red
with
green
stripes
sir
red
with
a
thin
green
stripe
was
the
sedleigh
color
shall
i
put
it
to
the
vote
sir
asked
stone
one
moment
stone
those
in
favor
of
the
motion
move
to
the
left
those
against
it
to
the
right
a
scuffling
of
feet
a
slamming
of
desk
lids
and
an
upset
blackboard
and
the
meeting
had
divided
mr
downing
rapped
irritably
on
his
desk
sit
down
he
said
sit
down
i
wo
have
this
noise
and
disturbance
stone
sit
down
wilson
get
back
to
your
place
please
sir
the
motion
is
carried
by
votes
to
six
please
sir
may
i
go
and
get
measured
this
evening
please
sir
the
idea
of
a
uniform
is
of
course
out
of
the
question
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
we
can
not
plunge
into
needless
expense
stone
listen
to
me
i
can
not
have
this
noise
and
disturbance
another
time
when
a
point
arises
it
must
be
settled
by
a
show
of
hands
well
wilson
please
sir
may
we
have
helmets
very
useful
as
a
protection
against
falling
timbers
sir
said
robinson
i
do
think
my
people
would
be
pleased
sir
if
they
knew
i
was
going
out
to
fires
without
a
helmet
said
stone
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
please
sir
may
we
have
helmets
those
in
favor
began
stone
mr
downing
banged
on
his
desk
silence
silence
silence
helmets
are
of
course
perfectly
preposterous
but
sir
the
danger
please
sir
the
falling
timbers
the
fire
brigade
had
been
in
action
once
and
once
only
in
the
memory
of
man
and
that
time
it
was
a
haystack
which
had
burned
itself
out
just
as
the
rescuers
had
succeeded
in
fastening
the
hose
to
the
hydrant
silence
then
please
sir
could
we
have
an
honor
cap
it
would
be
expensive
and
it
would
be
just
as
good
as
a
helmet
for
all
the
timbers
that
are
likely
to
fall
on
our
heads
mr
downing
smiled
a
wry
smile
our
wilson
is
facetious
he
remarked
frostily
sir
no
sir
i
was
facetious
or
could
we
have
tasseled
caps
like
the
first
fifteen
have
they
wilson
leave
the
room
sir
sir
this
moment
wilson
and
as
he
reached
the
door
do
me
one
hundred
lines
a
pained
was
cut
off
by
the
closing
door
mr
downing
proceeded
to
improve
the
occasion
i
deplore
this
growing
spirit
of
flippancy
he
said
i
tell
you
i
deplore
it
it
is
not
right
if
this
fire
brigade
is
to
be
of
solid
use
there
must
be
less
of
this
flippancy
we
must
have
keenness
i
want
you
boys
above
all
to
be
keen
i
what
is
that
noise
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
proceeded
a
sound
like
water
gurgling
from
a
bottle
mingled
with
cries
half
suppressed
as
if
somebody
were
being
prevented
from
uttering
them
by
a
hand
laid
over
his
mouth
the
sufferer
appeared
to
have
a
high
voice
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
mike
walked
in
he
was
not
alone
those
near
enough
to
see
saw
that
he
was
accompanied
by
jellicoe
clockwork
rat
which
moved
rapidly
over
the
floor
in
the
direction
of
the
opposite
wall
may
i
fetch
a
book
from
my
desk
sir
asked
mike
very
well
be
quick
jackson
we
are
busy
being
interrupted
in
one
of
his
addresses
to
the
brigade
irritated
mr
downing
the
muffled
cries
grew
more
distinct
what
is
that
noise
shrilled
mr
downing
noise
sir
asked
mike
puzzled
i
think
it
something
outside
the
window
sir
said
stone
helpfully
a
bird
i
think
sir
said
robinson
do
be
absurd
snapped
mr
downing
it
outside
the
door
wilson
yes
sir
said
a
voice
off
are
you
making
that
whining
noise
whining
noise
sir
no
sir
i
not
making
a
whining
noise
what
of
noise
sir
inquired
mike
as
many
wrykynians
had
asked
before
him
it
was
a
question
invented
by
wrykyn
for
use
in
just
such
a
case
as
this
i
do
not
propose
said
mr
downing
acidly
to
imitate
the
noise
you
can
all
hear
it
perfectly
plainly
it
is
a
curious
whining
noise
they
are
mowing
the
cricket
field
sir
said
the
invisible
wilson
perhaps
that
it
it
may
be
one
of
the
desks
squeaking
sir
put
in
stone
they
do
sometimes
or
somebody
shoes
sir
added
robinson
silence
wilson
yes
sir
bellowed
the
unseen
one
do
shout
at
me
from
the
corridor
like
that
come
in
yes
sir
as
he
spoke
the
muffled
whining
changed
suddenly
to
a
series
of
tenor
shrieks
and
the
form
of
sammy
bounded
into
the
room
like
an
excited
kangaroo
willing
hands
had
by
this
time
deflected
the
clockwork
rat
from
the
wall
to
which
it
had
been
steering
and
pointed
it
up
the
alleyway
between
the
two
rows
of
desks
mr
downing
rising
from
his
place
was
just
in
time
to
see
sammy
with
a
last
leap
spring
on
his
prey
and
begin
worrying
it
chaos
reigned
a
rat
shouted
robinson
the
members
of
the
brigade
who
were
not
earnest
instantly
dealt
with
the
situation
each
in
the
manner
that
seemed
proper
to
him
some
leaped
onto
forms
others
flung
books
all
shouted
it
was
a
stirring
bustling
scene
sammy
had
by
this
time
disposed
of
the
clockwork
rat
and
was
now
standing
like
marius
among
the
ruins
barking
triumphantly
the
banging
on
mr
downing
desk
resembled
thunder
it
rose
above
all
the
other
noises
till
in
time
they
gave
up
the
competition
and
died
away
mr
downing
shot
out
orders
threats
and
penalties
with
the
rapidity
of
a
bren
gun
stone
sit
down
donovan
if
you
do
not
sit
down
you
will
be
severely
punished
henderson
one
hundred
lines
for
gross
disorder
windham
the
same
go
to
your
seat
vincent
what
are
you
doing
i
will
not
have
this
disgraceful
noise
and
disorder
the
meeting
is
at
an
end
go
quietly
from
the
room
all
of
you
jackson
and
wilson
remain
i
said
durand
do
shuffle
your
feet
in
that
abominable
way
crash
wolferstan
i
distinctly
saw
you
upset
that
blackboard
with
a
movement
of
your
hand
one
hundred
lines
go
quietly
from
the
room
everybody
the
meeting
dispersed
jackson
and
wilson
come
here
what
the
meaning
of
this
disgraceful
conduct
put
that
dog
out
of
the
room
jackson
mike
removed
the
yelling
sammy
and
shut
the
door
on
him
well
wilson
please
sir
i
was
playing
with
a
clockwork
rat
what
business
have
you
to
be
playing
with
clockwork
rats
then
i
remembered
said
mike
that
i
had
left
my
horace
in
my
desk
so
i
came
in
and
by
a
fluke
sir
said
wilson
as
one
who
tells
of
strange
things
the
rat
happened
to
be
pointing
in
the
same
direction
so
he
came
in
too
i
met
sammy
on
the
gravel
outside
and
he
followed
me
i
tried
to
collar
him
but
when
you
told
me
to
come
in
sir
i
had
to
let
him
go
and
he
came
in
after
the
rat
it
was
plain
to
mr
downing
that
the
burden
of
sin
was
shared
equally
by
both
culprits
wilson
had
supplied
the
rat
mike
the
dog
but
mr
downing
liked
wilson
and
disliked
mike
wilson
was
in
the
fire
brigade
frivolous
at
times
it
was
true
but
nevertheless
a
member
also
he
kept
wicket
for
the
school
mike
was
a
member
of
the
archaeological
society
and
had
refused
to
play
cricket
mr
downing
allowed
these
facts
to
influence
him
in
passing
sentence
one
hundred
lines
wilson
he
said
you
may
go
wilson
departed
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
had
a
great
deal
of
fun
and
paid
very
little
for
it
mr
downing
turned
to
mike
you
will
stay
in
on
saturday
afternoon
jackson
it
will
interfere
with
your
archaeological
studies
i
fear
but
it
may
teach
you
that
we
have
no
room
at
sedleigh
for
boys
who
spend
their
time
loafing
about
and
making
themselves
a
nuisance
we
are
a
keen
school
this
is
no
place
for
boys
who
do
nothing
but
waste
their
time
that
will
do
jackson
and
mr
downing
walked
out
of
the
room
in
affairs
of
this
kind
a
master
has
a
habit
of
getting
the
last
word
achilles
leaves
his
tent
they
say
misfortunes
never
come
singly
as
mike
sat
brooding
over
his
wrongs
in
his
study
after
the
sammy
incident
jellicoe
came
into
the
room
and
without
preamble
asked
for
the
loan
of
a
pound
when
one
has
been
in
the
habit
of
confining
one
lendings
and
borrowings
to
sixpences
and
shillings
a
request
for
a
pound
comes
as
something
of
a
blow
what
on
earth
for
asked
mike
i
say
do
you
mind
if
i
do
tell
you
i
do
want
to
tell
anybody
the
fact
is
i
in
a
beastly
hole
oh
sorry
said
mike
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
happen
to
have
a
quid
you
can
freeze
on
to
it
if
you
like
but
it
about
all
i
have
got
so
do
be
shy
about
paying
it
back
jellicoe
was
profuse
in
his
thanks
and
disappeared
in
a
cloud
of
gratitude
mike
felt
that
fate
was
treating
him
badly
being
kept
in
on
saturday
meant
that
he
would
be
unable
to
turn
out
for
little
borlock
against
claythorpe
the
return
match
in
the
previous
game
he
had
scored
and
there
was
a
lob
bowler
in
the
claythorpe
ranks
whom
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
meet
again
having
to
yield
a
sovereign
to
jellicoe
why
on
earth
did
the
man
want
all
that
meant
that
unless
a
carefully
worded
letter
to
his
brother
bob
at
oxford
had
the
desired
effect
he
would
be
practically
penniless
for
weeks
in
a
gloomy
frame
of
mind
he
sat
down
to
write
to
bob
who
was
playing
regularly
for
the
varsity
this
season
and
only
the
previous
week
had
made
a
century
against
sussex
so
might
be
expected
to
be
in
a
sufficiently
softened
mood
to
advance
the
needful
which
it
may
be
stated
at
once
he
did
by
return
of
post
mike
was
struggling
with
the
opening
sentences
of
this
letter
he
was
never
a
very
ready
writer
when
stone
and
robinson
burst
into
the
room
mike
put
down
his
pen
and
got
up
he
was
in
warlike
mood
and
welcomed
the
intrusion
if
stone
and
robinson
wanted
battle
they
should
have
it
but
the
motives
of
the
expedition
were
obviously
friendly
stone
beamed
robinson
was
laughing
you
a
sportsman
said
robinson
what
did
he
give
you
asked
stone
they
sat
down
robinson
on
the
table
stone
in
psmith
deck
chair
mike
heart
warmed
to
them
the
little
disturbance
in
the
dormitory
was
a
thing
of
the
past
done
with
forgotten
contemporary
with
julius
caesar
he
felt
that
he
stone
and
robinson
must
learn
to
know
and
appreciate
one
another
there
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
much
wrong
with
stone
and
robinson
they
were
just
ordinary
raggers
of
the
type
found
at
every
public
school
small
and
large
they
were
absolutely
free
from
brain
they
had
a
certain
amount
of
muscle
and
a
vast
store
of
animal
spirits
they
looked
on
school
life
purely
as
a
vehicle
for
ragging
the
stones
and
robinsons
are
the
swashbucklers
of
the
school
world
they
go
about
loud
and
boisterous
with
a
wholehearted
and
cheerful
indifference
to
other
people
feelings
treading
on
the
toes
of
their
neighbor
and
shoving
him
off
the
pavement
and
always
with
an
eye
wide
open
for
any
adventure
as
to
the
kind
of
adventure
they
are
not
particular
so
long
as
it
promises
excitement
sometimes
they
go
through
their
whole
school
career
without
accident
more
often
they
run
up
against
a
snag
in
the
shape
of
some
and
muscular
person
who
objects
to
having
his
toes
trodden
on
and
being
shoved
off
the
pavement
and
then
they
usually
sober
down
to
the
mutual
advantage
of
themselves
and
the
rest
of
the
community
one
opinion
of
this
type
of
youth
varies
according
to
one
point
of
view
small
boys
whom
they
had
occasion
to
kick
either
from
pure
high
spirits
or
as
a
punishment
for
some
slip
from
the
narrow
path
which
the
ideal
small
boy
should
tread
regarded
stone
and
robinson
as
bullies
of
the
genuine
eric
and
winifred
brand
masters
were
rather
afraid
of
them
adair
had
a
smouldering
dislike
for
them
they
were
useful
at
cricket
but
apt
not
to
take
sedleigh
as
seriously
as
he
could
have
wished
as
for
mike
he
now
found
them
pleasant
company
and
began
to
get
out
the
tea
things
those
fire
brigade
meetings
said
stone
are
a
rag
you
can
do
what
you
like
and
you
never
get
more
than
a
hundred
lines
do
you
said
mike
i
got
saturday
afternoon
what
is
wilson
in
too
no
he
got
a
hundred
lines
stone
and
robinson
were
quite
concerned
what
a
beastly
swindle
that
because
you
do
play
cricket
old
downing
lets
you
do
what
you
like
if
you
join
the
fire
brigade
and
play
cricket
are
above
all
a
keen
school
quoted
stone
do
you
ever
play
i
have
played
a
bit
said
mike
well
why
do
you
have
a
shot
we
are
such
flyers
here
if
you
know
one
end
of
a
bat
from
the
other
you
could
get
into
some
sort
of
a
team
were
you
at
school
anywhere
before
you
came
here
i
was
at
wrykyn
why
on
earth
did
you
leave
asked
stone
were
you
sacked
no
my
father
took
me
away
wrykyn
said
robinson
are
you
any
relation
of
the
jacksons
there
and
the
others
brother
what
well
did
you
play
at
all
there
yes
said
mike
i
did
i
was
in
the
team
three
years
and
i
should
have
been
captain
this
year
if
i
stopped
on
there
was
a
profound
and
gratifying
sensation
stone
gaped
and
robinson
nearly
dropped
his
teacup
stone
broke
the
silence
but
i
mean
to
say
look
here
what
i
mean
is
why
are
you
playing
why
do
you
play
now
i
do
i
play
for
a
village
near
here
place
called
lower
borlock
a
man
who
played
against
wrykyn
for
the
free
foresters
captains
them
he
asked
me
if
i
like
some
games
for
them
but
why
not
for
the
school
why
should
i
it
much
better
fun
for
the
village
you
do
get
ordered
about
by
adair
for
a
start
adair
sticks
on
side
said
stone
enough
for
six
agreed
robinson
by
jove
said
stone
i
got
an
idea
my
word
what
a
rag
what
wrong
now
inquired
mike
politely
why
look
here
tomorrow
service
day
it
nowhere
near
the
middle
of
the
term
but
they
always
have
it
in
the
fourth
week
chapel
at
half
past
nine
till
half
past
ten
then
the
rest
of
the
a
whole
holiday
there
are
always
house
matches
we
playing
downing
why
do
you
play
and
let
smash
them
by
jove
yes
said
robinson
why
do
you
they
always
sticking
on
side
because
they
won
the
house
cup
three
years
running
i
say
do
you
bat
or
bowl
bat
why
robinson
rocked
on
the
table
why
old
downing
fancies
himself
as
a
bowler
you
play
and
knock
the
cover
off
him
masters
do
play
in
house
matches
surely
this
is
a
real
house
match
only
a
friendly
downing
always
turns
out
on
service
day
i
say
do
play
think
of
the
rag
but
the
team
full
said
mike
the
list
is
up
yet
we
nip
across
to
barnes
study
and
make
him
alter
it
they
dashed
out
of
the
room
from
down
the
passage
mike
heard
yells
of
the
closing
of
a
door
and
a
murmur
of
excited
conversation
then
footsteps
returning
down
the
passage
barnes
appeared
on
his
face
the
look
of
one
who
has
seen
visions
i
say
he
said
is
it
true
or
is
stone
rotting
about
wrykyn
i
mean
yes
i
was
in
the
team
barnes
was
an
enthusiastic
cricketer
he
studied
his
and
he
had
an
immense
respect
for
wrykyn
cricket
are
you
the
jackson
then
who
had
an
average
of
point
naught
three
last
year
yes
barnes
manner
became
like
that
of
a
curate
talking
to
a
bishop
i
say
he
said
then
er
will
you
play
against
downing
tomorrow
rather
said
mike
thanks
awfully
have
some
tea
the
match
with
it
is
the
curious
instinct
which
prompts
most
people
to
rub
a
thing
in
that
makes
the
lot
of
the
average
convert
an
unhappy
one
only
the
very
can
refrain
from
improving
the
occasion
and
scoring
off
the
convert
most
leap
at
the
opportunity
it
was
so
in
mike
case
mike
was
not
a
genuine
convert
but
to
mr
downing
he
had
the
outward
aspect
of
one
when
you
have
been
impressing
upon
a
noncricketing
boy
for
nearly
a
month
that
the
school
is
above
all
a
keen
school
that
all
members
of
it
should
play
cricket
and
that
by
not
playing
cricket
he
is
ruining
his
chances
in
this
world
and
imperiling
them
in
the
next
and
when
quite
unexpectedly
you
come
upon
this
boy
dressed
in
cricket
flannels
wearing
cricket
boots
and
carrying
a
cricket
bag
it
seems
only
natural
to
assume
that
you
have
converted
him
that
the
seeds
of
your
eloquence
have
fallen
on
fruitful
soil
and
sprouted
mr
downing
assumed
it
he
was
walking
to
the
field
with
adair
and
another
member
of
his
team
when
he
came
upon
mike
what
he
cried
our
jackson
clad
in
suit
of
mail
and
armed
for
the
fray
this
was
mr
downing
no
manner
the
playful
this
is
indeed
saul
among
the
prophets
why
this
sudden
enthusiasm
for
a
game
which
i
understood
that
you
despised
are
our
opponents
so
reduced
psmith
who
was
with
mike
took
charge
of
the
affair
with
a
languid
grace
which
had
maddened
hundreds
in
its
time
and
which
never
failed
to
ruffle
mr
downing
we
are
above
all
sir
he
said
a
keen
house
drones
are
not
welcomed
by
us
we
are
essentially
versatile
jackson
the
archaeologist
of
yesterday
becomes
the
cricketer
of
today
it
is
the
right
spirit
sir
said
psmith
earnestly
i
like
to
see
it
indeed
smith
you
are
not
playing
yourself
i
notice
your
enthusiasm
has
bounds
in
our
house
sir
competition
is
fierce
and
the
selection
committee
unfortunately
passed
me
over
there
were
a
number
of
pitches
dotted
about
over
the
field
for
there
was
always
a
touch
of
the
london
park
about
it
on
service
day
adair
as
captain
of
cricket
had
naturally
selected
the
best
for
his
own
match
it
was
a
good
wicket
mike
saw
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
wickets
at
sedleigh
were
nearly
always
good
adair
had
infected
the
groundsman
with
some
of
his
own
keenness
with
the
result
that
that
official
now
found
himself
sometimes
with
a
kind
of
mild
surprise
working
really
hard
at
the
beginning
of
the
previous
season
sedleigh
had
played
a
scratch
team
from
a
neighboring
town
on
a
wicket
which
except
for
the
creases
was
absolutely
undistinguishable
from
the
surrounding
turf
and
behind
the
pavilion
after
the
match
adair
had
spoken
certain
home
truths
to
the
groundsman
the
latter
reformation
had
dated
from
that
moment
barnes
timidly
jubilant
came
up
to
mike
with
the
news
that
he
had
won
the
toss
and
the
request
that
mike
would
go
in
first
with
him
in
stories
of
the
not
really
a
duffer
type
where
the
nervous
new
boy
who
has
been
found
crying
in
the
changing
room
over
the
photograph
of
his
sister
contrives
to
get
an
innings
in
a
game
nobody
suspects
that
he
is
really
a
prodigy
till
he
hits
the
bully
first
ball
out
of
the
ground
for
six
with
mike
it
was
different
there
was
no
pitying
smile
on
adair
face
as
he
started
his
run
preparatory
to
sending
down
the
first
ball
mike
on
the
cricket
field
could
not
have
looked
anything
but
a
cricketer
if
he
had
turned
out
in
a
tweed
suit
and
hobnail
boots
cricketer
was
written
all
over
him
in
his
walk
in
the
way
he
took
guard
in
his
stand
at
the
wicket
adair
started
to
bowl
with
the
feeling
that
this
was
somebody
who
had
more
than
a
little
knowledge
of
how
to
deal
with
good
bowling
and
punish
bad
mike
started
cautiously
he
was
more
than
usually
anxious
to
make
runs
today
and
he
meant
to
take
no
risks
till
he
could
afford
to
do
so
he
had
seen
adair
bowl
at
the
nets
and
he
knew
that
he
was
good
the
first
over
was
a
maiden
six
dangerous
balls
beautifully
played
the
fieldsmen
changed
over
the
general
interest
had
now
settled
on
the
match
between
outwood
and
downing
the
facts
in
mike
case
had
gone
around
the
field
and
as
several
of
the
other
games
had
not
yet
begun
quite
a
large
crowd
had
collected
near
the
pavilion
to
watch
mike
masterly
treatment
of
the
opening
over
had
impressed
the
spectators
and
there
was
a
popular
desire
to
see
how
he
would
deal
with
mr
downing
slows
it
was
generally
anticipated
that
he
would
do
something
special
with
them
off
the
first
ball
of
the
master
over
a
was
run
mike
took
guard
mr
downing
was
a
bowler
with
a
style
of
his
own
he
took
two
short
steps
two
long
steps
gave
a
jump
took
three
more
short
steps
and
ended
with
a
combination
of
step
and
jump
during
which
the
ball
emerged
from
behind
his
back
and
started
on
its
slow
career
to
the
wicket
the
whole
business
had
some
of
the
dignity
of
the
minuet
subtly
blended
with
the
careless
vigor
of
a
cakewalk
the
ball
when
delivered
was
billed
to
break
from
leg
but
the
program
was
subject
to
alterations
if
the
spectators
had
expected
mike
to
begin
any
firework
effects
with
the
first
ball
they
were
disappointed
he
played
the
over
through
with
a
grace
worthy
of
his
brother
joe
the
last
ball
he
turned
to
leg
for
a
single
his
treatment
of
adair
next
over
was
freer
he
had
got
a
sight
of
the
ball
now
halfway
through
the
over
a
beautiful
square
cut
forced
a
passage
through
the
crowd
by
the
pavilion
and
dashed
up
against
the
rails
he
drove
the
sixth
ball
past
cover
for
three
the
crowd
was
now
reluctantly
dispersing
to
its
own
games
but
it
stopped
as
mr
downing
started
his
in
the
hope
that
it
might
see
something
more
sensational
this
time
the
hope
was
fulfilled
the
ball
was
well
up
slow
and
off
the
wicket
on
the
perhaps
if
it
had
been
allowed
to
pitch
it
might
have
broken
in
and
become
quite
dangerous
mike
went
out
at
it
and
hit
it
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
ground
the
ball
dropped
with
a
thud
and
a
spurting
of
dust
in
the
road
that
ran
along
one
side
of
the
cricket
field
it
was
returned
on
the
installment
system
by
helpers
from
other
games
and
the
bowler
began
his
maneuvers
again
a
half
volley
this
time
mike
slammed
it
back
and
mid
on
whose
heart
was
obviously
not
in
the
thing
failed
to
stop
it
get
to
them
jenkins
said
mr
downing
irritably
as
the
ball
came
back
from
the
boundary
get
to
them
sir
please
sir
do
talk
in
the
field
jenkins
having
had
a
full
pitch
hit
for
six
and
a
half
volley
for
four
there
was
a
strong
probability
that
mr
downing
would
pitch
his
next
ball
short
the
expected
happened
the
third
ball
was
a
slow
long
hop
and
hit
the
road
at
about
the
same
spot
where
the
first
had
landed
a
howl
of
untuneful
applause
rose
from
the
watchers
in
the
pavilion
and
mike
with
the
feeling
that
this
sort
of
bowling
was
too
good
to
be
true
waited
in
position
for
number
four
there
are
moments
when
a
sort
of
panic
seizes
a
bowler
this
happened
now
with
mr
downing
he
suddenly
abandoned
science
and
ran
amok
his
run
lost
its
stateliness
and
increased
its
vigor
he
charged
up
to
the
wicket
as
a
wounded
buffalo
sometimes
charges
a
gun
his
whole
idea
now
was
to
bowl
fast
when
a
slow
bowler
starts
to
bowl
fast
it
is
usually
as
well
to
be
batting
if
you
can
manage
it
by
the
time
the
over
was
finished
mike
score
had
been
increased
by
sixteen
and
the
total
of
his
side
in
addition
by
three
wides
and
a
shrill
small
voice
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
pavilion
uttered
with
painful
distinctness
the
words
take
him
off
that
was
how
the
most
sensational
day
cricket
began
that
sedleigh
had
known
a
description
of
the
details
of
the
morning
play
would
be
monotonous
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
ran
on
much
the
same
lines
as
the
third
and
fourth
overs
of
the
match
mr
downing
bowled
one
more
over
off
which
mike
helped
himself
to
sixteen
runs
and
then
retired
moodily
to
cover
point
where
in
adair
fifth
over
he
missed
barnes
the
first
occasion
since
the
game
began
on
which
that
mild
batsman
had
attempted
to
score
more
than
a
single
scared
by
this
escape
outwood
captain
shrank
back
into
his
shell
sat
on
the
splice
like
a
limpet
and
offering
no
more
chances
was
not
out
at
lunchtime
with
a
score
of
eleven
mike
had
then
made
a
hundred
and
three
as
mike
was
taking
off
his
pads
in
the
pavilion
adair
came
up
why
did
you
say
you
did
play
cricket
he
asked
abruptly
when
one
has
been
bowling
the
whole
morning
and
bowling
well
without
the
slightest
success
one
is
inclined
to
be
abrupt
mike
finished
unfastening
an
obstinate
strap
then
he
looked
up
i
did
say
anything
of
the
kind
i
said
i
was
going
to
play
here
there
a
difference
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
in
the
wrykyn
team
before
i
came
here
three
years
adair
was
silent
for
a
moment
will
you
play
for
us
against
the
old
sedleighans
tomorrow
he
said
at
length
mike
tossed
his
pads
into
his
bag
and
got
up
no
thanks
there
was
a
silence
above
it
i
suppose
not
a
bit
not
up
to
it
i
shall
want
a
lot
of
coaching
at
that
end
net
of
yours
before
i
fit
to
play
for
sedleigh
there
was
another
pause
then
you
wo
play
asked
adair
i
not
keeping
you
am
i
said
mike
politely
it
was
remarkable
what
a
number
of
members
of
outwood
house
appeared
to
cherish
a
personal
grudge
against
mr
downing
it
had
been
that
master
somewhat
injudicious
practice
for
many
years
to
treat
his
own
house
as
a
sort
of
chosen
people
of
all
masters
the
most
unpopular
is
he
who
by
the
silent
tribunal
of
a
school
is
convicted
of
favoritism
and
the
dislike
deepens
if
it
is
a
house
which
he
favors
and
not
merely
individuals
on
occasions
when
boys
in
his
own
house
and
boys
from
other
houses
were
accomplices
and
partners
in
wrongdoing
mr
downing
distributed
his
thunderbolts
unequally
and
the
school
noticed
it
the
result
was
that
not
only
he
himself
but
also
which
was
rather
unfair
his
house
too
had
acquired
a
good
deal
of
unpopularity
the
general
consensus
of
opinion
in
outwood
during
the
luncheon
interval
was
that
having
got
downing
up
a
tree
they
would
be
fools
not
to
make
the
most
of
the
situation
barnes
remark
that
he
supposed
unless
anything
happened
and
wickets
began
to
fall
a
bit
faster
they
had
better
think
of
declaring
somewhere
about
half
past
three
or
four
was
met
with
a
storm
of
opposition
declare
said
robinson
great
scot
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
declare
stone
voice
was
almost
a
wail
of
indignation
i
never
saw
such
a
chump
they
be
rather
sick
if
we
do
wo
they
suggested
barnes
sick
i
should
think
they
would
said
stone
that
just
the
gay
idea
ca
you
see
that
by
a
miracle
we
got
a
chance
of
getting
a
jolly
good
bit
of
our
own
back
against
those
downing
ticks
what
got
to
do
is
to
jolly
well
keep
them
in
the
field
all
day
if
we
can
and
be
jolly
glad
it
so
beastly
hot
if
they
lose
about
a
dozen
pounds
each
through
sweating
about
in
the
sun
after
jackson
drives
perhaps
they
stick
on
less
side
about
things
in
general
in
future
besides
i
want
an
innings
against
that
bilge
of
old
downing
if
i
can
get
it
so
do
i
said
robinson
if
you
declare
i
swear
i
wo
field
nor
will
robinson
rather
not
well
i
wo
then
said
barnes
unhappily
only
you
know
rather
sick
already
do
you
worry
about
that
said
stone
with
a
wide
grin
they
be
a
lot
sicker
before
we
finished
and
so
it
came
about
that
that
particular
match
made
history
big
scores
had
often
been
put
up
on
service
day
games
had
frequently
been
but
it
had
never
happened
before
in
the
annals
of
the
school
that
one
side
going
in
first
early
in
the
morning
had
neither
completed
its
innings
nor
declared
it
closed
when
stumps
were
drawn
at
in
no
previous
sedleigh
match
after
a
full
day
play
had
the
pathetic
words
did
not
bat
been
written
against
the
whole
of
one
of
the
contending
teams
these
are
the
things
which
mark
epochs
play
was
resumed
at
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mike
was
comparatively
quiet
adair
fortified
by
food
and
rest
was
bowling
really
well
and
his
first
half
dozen
overs
had
to
be
watched
carefully
but
the
wicket
was
too
good
to
give
him
a
chance
and
mike
playing
himself
in
again
proceeded
to
get
to
business
once
more
bowlers
came
and
went
adair
pounded
away
at
one
end
with
brief
intervals
between
the
attacks
mr
downing
took
a
couple
more
overs
in
one
of
which
a
horse
passing
in
the
road
nearly
had
its
useful
life
cut
suddenly
short
change
bowlers
of
various
actions
and
paces
each
weirder
and
more
futile
than
the
last
tried
their
luck
but
still
the
stand
continued
the
bowling
of
a
house
team
is
all
head
and
no
body
the
first
pair
probably
have
some
idea
of
length
and
break
the
pair
are
poor
and
the
rest
the
small
change
are
simply
the
sort
of
things
one
sees
in
dreams
after
a
heavy
supper
or
when
one
is
out
without
one
gun
time
mercifully
generally
breaks
up
a
big
stand
at
cricket
before
the
field
has
suffered
too
much
and
that
is
what
happened
now
at
four
when
the
score
stood
at
two
hundred
and
twenty
for
no
wicket
barnes
greatly
daring
smote
lustily
at
a
rather
wide
half
volley
and
was
caught
at
short
slip
for
he
retired
blushfully
to
the
pavilion
amidst
applause
and
stone
came
out
as
mike
had
then
made
a
hundred
and
it
was
assumed
by
the
field
that
directly
he
had
topped
his
second
century
the
closure
would
be
applied
and
their
ordeal
finished
there
was
almost
a
sigh
of
relief
when
frantic
cheering
from
the
crowd
told
that
the
feat
had
been
accomplished
the
fieldsmen
clapped
in
quite
an
indulgent
sort
of
way
as
who
should
say
capital
capital
and
now
let
start
innings
some
even
began
to
edge
toward
the
pavilion
but
the
next
ball
was
bowled
and
the
next
over
and
the
next
after
that
and
still
barnes
made
no
sign
the
conscience
stricken
captain
of
outwood
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
being
practically
held
down
by
robinson
and
other
ruffians
by
force
a
gray
dismay
settled
on
the
field
the
bowling
had
now
become
almost
unbelievably
bad
lobs
were
being
tried
and
stone
nearly
weeping
with
pure
joy
was
playing
an
innings
of
the
type
he
had
an
unorthodox
style
but
an
excellent
eye
and
the
road
at
this
period
of
the
game
became
absolutely
unsafe
for
pedestrians
and
traffic
mike
pace
had
become
slower
as
was
only
natural
but
his
score
too
was
mounting
steadily
this
is
foolery
snapped
mr
downing
as
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
went
up
on
the
board
barnes
he
called
there
was
no
reply
a
committee
of
three
was
at
that
moment
engaged
in
sitting
on
barnes
head
in
the
first
eleven
changing
room
in
order
to
correct
a
more
than
usually
feverish
attack
of
conscience
barnes
please
sir
said
stone
some
species
of
telepathy
telling
him
what
was
detaining
his
captain
i
think
barnes
must
have
left
the
field
he
has
probably
gone
over
to
the
house
to
fetch
something
this
is
absurd
you
must
declare
your
innings
closed
the
game
has
become
a
farce
declare
sir
we
ca
unless
barnes
does
he
might
be
awfully
annoyed
if
we
did
anything
like
that
without
consulting
him
absurd
he
very
touchy
sir
it
is
perfect
foolery
i
think
jenkins
is
just
going
to
bowl
sir
mr
downing
walked
moodily
to
his
place
in
a
neat
wooden
frame
in
the
senior
day
room
at
outwood
just
above
the
mantlepiece
there
was
on
view
a
week
later
a
slip
of
paper
the
writing
on
it
was
as
follows
outwood
first
barnes
hammond
hassall
jackson
not
out
stone
not
out
extras
total
for
one
wicket
downing
did
not
bat
the
singular
behavior
of
jellicoe
outwood
rollicked
considerably
that
night
mike
if
he
had
cared
to
take
the
part
could
have
been
the
petted
hero
but
a
cordial
invitation
from
the
senior
day
room
to
be
the
guest
of
the
evening
at
about
the
biggest
rag
of
the
century
had
been
refused
on
the
plea
of
fatigue
one
does
not
make
two
hundred
and
runs
on
a
hot
day
without
feeling
the
effects
even
if
one
has
scored
mainly
by
the
medium
of
boundaries
and
mike
as
he
lay
back
in
psmith
deck
chair
felt
that
all
he
wanted
was
to
go
to
bed
and
stay
there
for
a
week
his
hands
and
arms
burned
as
if
they
were
and
his
eyes
were
so
tired
that
he
could
not
keep
them
open
psmith
leaning
against
the
mantlepiece
discoursed
in
a
desultory
way
on
the
day
happenings
the
score
off
mr
downing
the
undeniable
annoyance
of
that
battered
bowler
and
the
probability
of
his
venting
his
annoyance
on
mike
next
day
in
theory
said
he
the
manly
of
cricket
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
ought
to
make
him
fall
on
your
neck
tomorrow
and
weep
over
you
as
a
foeman
worthy
of
his
steel
but
i
am
prepared
to
bet
a
reasonable
sum
that
he
will
give
no
jujitsu
exhibition
of
this
kind
in
fact
from
what
i
have
seen
of
our
bright
little
friend
i
should
say
that
in
a
small
way
he
will
do
his
best
to
make
it
distinctly
hot
for
you
here
and
there
i
do
care
murmured
mike
shifting
his
aching
limbs
in
the
chair
in
an
ordinary
way
i
suppose
a
man
can
put
up
with
having
his
bowling
hit
a
little
but
your
performance
was
cruelty
to
animals
off
one
over
not
to
mention
three
wides
would
have
made
job
foam
at
the
mouth
you
will
probably
get
sacked
on
the
other
hand
it
worth
it
you
have
lit
a
candle
this
day
which
can
never
be
blown
out
you
have
shown
the
lads
of
the
village
how
comrade
downing
bowling
ought
to
be
treated
i
do
suppose
he
ever
take
another
wicket
he
does
deserve
to
psmith
smoothed
his
hair
at
the
glass
and
turned
round
again
the
only
blot
on
this
day
of
mirth
and
goodwill
is
he
said
the
singular
conduct
of
our
friend
jellicoe
when
all
the
place
was
ringing
with
song
and
merriment
comrade
jellicoe
crept
to
my
side
and
slipping
his
little
hand
in
mine
touched
me
for
three
quid
this
interested
mike
tired
as
he
was
what
three
quid
three
crisp
crackling
quid
he
wanted
four
but
the
man
must
be
living
at
the
rate
of
i
do
know
what
it
was
only
yesterday
that
he
borrowed
a
quid
from
he
must
be
saving
money
fast
there
appear
to
be
the
makings
of
a
financier
about
comrade
jellicoe
well
i
hope
when
he
collected
enough
for
his
needs
he
pay
me
back
a
bit
i
pretty
well
cleaned
out
i
got
some
from
my
brother
at
oxford
perhaps
he
saving
up
to
get
married
we
may
be
helping
toward
furnishing
the
home
there
was
a
siamese
prince
fellow
at
my
dame
at
eton
who
had
four
wives
when
he
arrived
and
gathered
in
a
fifth
during
his
first
summer
holidays
it
was
done
on
the
correspondence
system
his
prime
minister
fixed
it
up
at
the
other
end
and
sent
him
the
glad
news
on
a
picture
post
card
i
think
an
eye
ought
to
be
kept
on
comrade
jellicoe
mike
tumbled
into
bed
that
night
like
a
log
but
he
could
not
sleep
he
ached
all
over
psmith
chatted
for
a
time
on
human
affairs
in
general
and
then
dropped
gently
off
jellicoe
who
appeared
to
be
wrapped
in
gloom
contributed
nothing
to
the
conversation
after
psmith
had
gone
to
sleep
mike
lay
for
some
time
running
over
in
his
mind
as
the
best
substitute
for
sleep
the
various
points
of
his
innings
that
day
he
felt
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
just
as
he
was
wondering
whether
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
to
get
up
and
have
a
cold
bath
a
voice
spoke
from
the
darkness
at
his
side
are
you
asleep
jackson
who
that
me
jellicoe
i
ca
get
to
sleep
nor
can
i
stiff
all
over
i
come
over
and
sit
on
your
bed
there
was
a
creaking
and
then
a
weight
descended
in
the
neighborhood
of
mike
toes
jellicoe
was
apparently
not
in
conversational
mood
he
uttered
no
word
for
quite
three
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
gave
a
sound
midway
between
a
snort
and
a
sigh
i
say
jackson
he
said
yes
have
you
oh
nothing
silence
again
jackson
hello
i
say
what
would
your
people
say
if
you
got
sacked
all
sorts
of
things
especially
my
father
why
oh
i
do
know
so
would
mine
everybody
would
i
expect
yes
the
bed
creaked
as
jellicoe
digested
these
great
thoughts
then
he
spoke
again
it
would
be
a
jolly
beastly
thing
to
get
sacked
mike
was
too
tired
to
give
his
mind
to
the
subject
he
was
not
really
listening
jellicoe
droned
on
in
a
depressed
sort
of
way
you
get
home
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
suppose
and
drive
up
to
the
house
and
the
servant
would
open
the
door
and
you
go
in
they
might
all
be
out
and
then
you
have
to
hang
about
and
wait
and
presently
you
hear
them
come
in
and
you
go
out
into
the
passage
and
they
say
jellicoe
in
order
to
give
verisimilitude
as
it
were
to
an
otherwise
bald
and
unconvincing
narrative
flung
so
much
agitated
surprise
into
the
last
word
that
it
woke
mike
from
a
troubled
doze
into
which
he
had
fallen
hello
he
said
what
up
then
you
say
and
then
they
say
are
you
doing
here
and
you
say
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
about
what
would
happen
happen
when
when
you
got
home
after
being
sacked
you
know
who
been
sacked
mike
mind
was
still
under
a
cloud
nobody
but
if
you
were
i
meant
and
then
i
suppose
there
be
an
awful
row
and
general
sickness
and
all
that
and
then
you
be
sent
into
a
bank
or
to
australia
or
something
mike
dozed
off
again
my
father
would
be
frightfully
sick
my
mater
would
be
sick
my
sister
would
be
jolly
sick
too
have
you
got
any
sisters
jackson
i
say
jackson
hello
what
the
matter
who
that
me
jellicoe
what
up
i
asked
you
if
you
got
any
sisters
any
sisters
whose
sisters
yours
i
asked
if
you
got
any
any
what
sisters
what
about
them
the
conversation
was
becoming
too
intricate
for
jellicoe
he
changed
the
subject
i
say
jackson
well
i
say
you
do
know
anyone
who
could
lend
me
a
pound
do
you
what
cried
mike
sitting
up
in
bed
and
staring
through
the
darkness
in
the
direction
whence
the
numismatist
voice
was
proceeding
do
i
say
look
out
you
wake
psmith
did
you
say
you
wanted
someone
to
lend
you
a
quid
yes
said
jellicoe
eagerly
do
you
know
anyone
mike
head
throbbed
this
thing
was
too
much
the
human
brain
could
not
be
expected
to
cope
with
it
here
was
a
youth
who
had
borrowed
a
pound
from
one
friend
the
day
before
and
three
pounds
from
another
friend
that
very
afternoon
already
looking
about
him
for
further
loans
was
it
a
hobby
or
was
he
saving
up
to
buy
an
airplane
what
on
earth
do
you
want
a
pound
for
i
do
want
to
tell
anybody
but
it
jolly
serious
i
shall
get
sacked
if
i
do
get
it
mike
pondered
those
who
have
followed
mike
career
as
set
forth
by
the
present
historian
will
have
realized
by
this
time
that
he
was
a
good
long
way
from
being
perfect
as
the
hero
he
would
have
been
a
rank
failure
except
on
the
cricket
field
where
he
was
a
natural
genius
he
was
just
ordinary
he
resembled
ninety
percent
of
other
members
of
english
public
schools
he
had
some
virtues
and
a
good
many
defects
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
though
people
whom
he
liked
could
do
as
they
pleased
with
him
he
was
as
a
general
thing
but
on
occasion
his
temper
could
be
of
the
worst
and
had
in
his
childhood
been
the
subject
of
much
adverse
comment
among
his
aunts
he
was
rigidly
truthful
where
the
issue
concerned
only
himself
where
it
was
a
case
of
saving
a
friend
he
was
prepared
to
act
in
a
manner
reminiscent
of
an
american
expert
witness
he
had
in
addition
one
good
quality
without
any
defect
to
balance
it
he
was
always
ready
to
help
people
and
when
he
set
himself
to
do
this
he
was
never
put
off
by
discomfort
or
risk
he
went
at
the
thing
with
a
singleness
of
purpose
that
asked
no
questions
bob
postal
order
which
had
arrived
that
evening
was
reposing
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
it
was
a
wrench
but
if
the
situation
was
so
serious
with
jellicoe
it
had
to
be
done
two
minutes
later
the
night
was
being
made
hideous
by
jellicoe
almost
tearful
protestations
of
gratitude
and
the
postal
order
had
moved
from
one
side
of
the
dormitory
to
the
other
jellicoe
goes
on
the
sick
list
mike
woke
next
morning
with
a
confused
memory
of
having
listened
to
a
great
deal
of
incoherent
conversation
from
jellicoe
and
a
painfully
vivid
recollection
of
handing
over
the
bulk
of
his
worldly
wealth
to
him
the
thought
depressed
him
though
it
seemed
to
please
jellicoe
for
the
latter
caroled
in
a
gay
undertone
as
he
dressed
till
psmith
who
had
a
sensitive
ear
asked
as
a
favor
that
these
farmyard
imitations
might
cease
until
he
was
out
of
the
room
there
were
other
things
to
make
mike
that
morning
to
begin
with
he
was
in
detention
which
in
itself
is
enough
to
spoil
a
day
it
was
a
particularly
fine
day
which
made
the
matter
worse
in
addition
to
this
he
had
never
felt
stiffer
in
his
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
creaking
of
his
joints
as
he
walked
must
be
audible
to
everyone
within
a
radius
of
several
yards
finally
there
was
the
interview
with
mr
downing
to
come
that
would
probably
be
unpleasant
as
psmith
had
said
mr
downing
was
the
sort
of
master
who
would
be
likely
to
make
trouble
the
great
match
had
not
been
an
ordinary
match
mr
downing
was
a
curious
man
in
many
ways
but
he
did
not
make
a
fuss
on
ordinary
occasions
when
his
bowling
proved
expensive
yesterday
performance
however
stood
in
a
class
by
itself
it
stood
forth
without
disguise
as
a
deliberate
rag
one
side
does
not
keep
another
in
the
field
the
whole
day
in
a
match
except
as
a
grisly
kind
of
practical
joke
and
mr
downing
and
his
house
realized
this
the
house
way
of
signifying
its
comprehension
of
the
fact
was
to
be
cold
and
distant
as
far
as
the
seniors
were
concerned
and
abusive
and
pugnacious
as
regards
the
juniors
young
blood
had
been
shed
overnight
and
more
flowed
during
the
interval
that
morning
to
avenge
the
insult
mr
downing
methods
of
retaliation
would
have
to
be
of
necessity
more
elusive
but
mike
did
not
doubt
that
in
some
way
or
other
his
form
master
would
endeavor
to
get
a
bit
of
his
own
back
as
events
turned
out
he
was
perfectly
right
when
a
master
has
got
his
knife
into
a
boy
especially
a
master
who
allows
himself
to
be
influenced
by
his
likes
and
dislikes
he
is
inclined
to
single
him
out
in
times
of
stress
and
savage
him
as
if
he
were
the
official
representative
of
the
evildoers
just
as
at
sea
the
skipper
when
he
has
trouble
with
the
crew
works
it
off
on
the
boy
mr
downing
was
in
a
sarcastic
mood
when
he
met
mike
that
is
to
say
he
began
in
a
sarcastic
strain
but
this
sort
of
thing
is
difficult
to
keep
up
by
the
time
he
had
reached
his
peroration
the
rapier
had
given
place
to
the
bludgeon
for
sarcasm
to
be
effective
the
user
of
it
must
be
met
halfway
his
hearer
must
appear
to
be
conscious
of
the
sarcasm
and
moved
by
it
mike
when
masters
waxed
sarcastic
toward
him
always
assumed
an
air
of
stolid
stupidity
which
was
as
a
suit
of
mail
against
satire
so
mr
downing
came
down
from
the
heights
with
a
run
and
began
to
express
himself
with
a
simple
strength
which
it
did
his
form
good
to
listen
to
veterans
who
had
been
in
the
form
for
terms
said
afterward
that
there
had
been
nothing
to
touch
it
in
their
experience
of
the
orator
since
the
glorious
day
when
dunster
that
prince
of
raggers
who
had
left
at
christmas
to
go
to
a
crammer
had
introduced
three
lively
grass
snakes
into
the
room
during
a
latin
lesson
you
are
surrounded
concluded
mr
downing
snapping
his
pencil
in
two
in
his
emotion
by
an
impenetrable
mass
of
conceit
and
vanity
and
selfishness
it
does
not
occur
to
you
to
admit
your
capabilities
as
a
cricketer
in
an
open
straightforward
way
and
place
them
at
the
disposal
of
the
school
no
that
would
not
be
dramatic
enough
for
you
it
would
be
too
commonplace
altogether
far
too
commonplace
mr
downing
laughed
bitterly
no
you
must
conceal
your
capabilities
you
must
act
a
lie
you
must
who
is
that
shuffling
his
feet
i
will
not
have
it
i
have
silence
you
must
hang
back
in
order
to
make
a
more
effective
entrance
like
some
wretched
actor
who
i
will
have
this
shuffling
i
have
spoken
of
this
before
macpherson
are
you
shuffling
your
feet
sir
no
sir
please
sir
well
parsons
i
think
it
the
noise
of
the
draft
under
the
door
sir
instant
departure
of
parsons
for
the
outer
regions
and
in
the
excitement
of
this
side
issue
the
speaker
lost
his
inspiration
and
abruptly
concluded
his
remarks
by
putting
mike
on
to
translate
in
cicero
which
mike
who
happened
to
have
prepared
the
first
did
with
much
success
the
old
boys
match
was
timed
to
begin
shortly
after
eleven
during
the
interval
most
of
the
school
walked
across
the
field
to
look
at
the
pitch
one
or
two
of
the
old
boys
had
already
changed
and
were
practicing
in
front
of
the
pavilion
it
was
through
one
of
these
batsmen
that
an
accident
occurred
which
had
a
good
deal
of
influence
on
mike
affairs
mike
had
strolled
out
by
himself
halfway
across
the
field
jellicoe
joined
him
jellicoe
was
cheerful
and
rather
embarrassingly
grateful
he
was
just
in
the
middle
of
his
harangue
when
the
accident
happened
to
their
left
as
they
crossed
the
field
a
long
youth
with
the
faint
beginnings
of
a
moustache
and
a
blazer
that
lit
up
the
surrounding
landscape
like
a
glowing
beacon
was
lashing
out
recklessly
at
a
friend
bowling
already
he
had
gone
within
an
ace
of
slaying
a
small
boy
as
mike
and
jellicoe
proceeded
on
their
way
there
was
a
shout
of
heads
the
almost
universal
habit
of
batsmen
of
shouting
heads
at
whatever
height
from
the
ground
the
ball
may
be
is
not
a
little
confusing
the
average
person
on
hearing
the
shout
puts
his
hands
over
his
skull
crouches
down
and
trusts
to
luck
this
is
an
excellent
plan
if
the
ball
is
falling
but
is
not
much
protection
against
a
skimming
drive
along
the
ground
when
heads
was
called
on
the
present
occasion
mike
and
jellicoe
instantly
assumed
the
crouching
attitude
jellicoe
was
the
first
to
abandon
it
he
uttered
a
yell
and
sprang
into
the
air
after
which
he
sat
down
and
began
to
nurse
his
ankle
the
youth
walked
up
awfully
sorry
you
know
hurt
jellicoe
was
pressing
the
injured
spot
tenderly
with
his
fingertips
uttering
sharp
howls
whenever
zeal
outrunning
discretion
he
prodded
himself
too
energetically
silly
ass
dunster
he
groaned
slamming
about
like
that
awfully
sorry
but
i
did
yell
it
swelling
up
rather
said
mike
you
better
get
over
to
the
house
and
have
it
looked
at
can
you
walk
jellicoe
tried
but
sat
down
again
with
a
loud
ow
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
i
shall
have
to
be
going
in
said
mike
or
i
have
helped
you
over
i
give
you
a
hand
said
dunster
he
helped
the
sufferer
to
his
feet
and
they
staggered
off
together
jellicoe
hopping
dunster
advancing
with
a
sort
of
polka
step
mike
watched
them
start
and
then
turned
to
go
in
mike
receives
a
commission
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
said
in
favor
of
detention
on
a
fine
summer
afternoon
and
that
is
that
it
is
very
pleasant
to
come
out
of
the
sun
never
seems
so
bright
or
the
turf
so
green
as
during
the
first
five
minutes
after
one
has
come
out
of
the
detention
room
one
feels
as
if
one
were
entering
a
new
and
very
delightful
world
there
is
also
a
touch
of
the
rip
van
winkle
feeling
everything
seems
to
have
gone
on
and
left
one
behind
mike
as
he
walked
to
the
cricket
field
felt
very
much
behind
the
times
arriving
on
the
field
he
found
the
old
boys
batting
he
stopped
and
watched
an
over
of
adair
the
fifth
ball
bowled
a
man
mike
made
his
way
toward
the
pavilion
before
he
got
there
he
heard
his
name
called
and
turning
found
psmith
seated
under
a
tree
with
the
dunster
return
of
the
exile
said
psmith
a
joyful
occasion
tinged
with
melancholy
have
a
cherry
take
one
or
two
these
little
acts
of
unremembered
kindness
are
what
one
needs
after
a
couple
of
hours
in
extra
pupil
room
restore
your
tissues
comrade
jackson
and
when
you
have
finished
those
apply
again
is
your
name
jackson
inquired
dunster
because
jellicoe
wants
to
see
you
alas
poor
jellicoe
said
psmith
he
is
now
prone
on
his
bed
in
the
dormitory
there
a
sheer
hulk
lies
poor
tom
jellicoe
the
darling
of
the
crew
faithful
below
he
did
his
duty
but
comrade
dunster
has
broached
him
to
i
have
just
been
hearing
the
melancholy
details
old
smith
and
i
said
dunster
were
at
prep
school
together
i
no
idea
i
should
find
him
here
it
was
a
wonderfully
stirring
sight
when
we
met
said
psmith
not
unlike
the
meeting
of
ulysses
and
the
hound
argos
of
whom
you
have
doubtless
read
in
the
course
of
your
dabblings
in
the
classics
i
was
ulysses
dunster
gave
a
lifelike
representation
of
the
faithful
dawg
you
still
jaw
as
much
as
ever
i
notice
said
the
animal
delineator
fondling
the
beginnings
of
his
moustache
more
sighed
psmith
more
is
anything
irritating
you
he
added
eyeing
the
other
maneuvers
with
interest
you
need
be
a
funny
ass
man
said
dunster
pained
heaps
of
people
tell
me
i
ought
to
have
it
waxed
what
it
really
wants
is
with
guano
hello
another
man

adair
bowling
better
today
than
he
did
yesterday
i
heard
about

said
dunster
it
must
have
been
a
rag
could
we
work
off
some
other
rag
on
somebody
before
i
go
i
shall
be
stopping
here
till
monday
in
the
village
well
hit
sir
adair
bowling
is
perfectly
simple
if
you
go
out
to
it
comrade
dunster
went
out
to
it
first
ball
said
psmith
to
mike
oh
chuck

man
the
sun

in
my
eyes
i
hear
adair

a
match
on
with

last
has
he
said
psmith
i
had
heard
archaeology
claims
so
much
of
my
time
that
i
have
little
leisure
for
listening
to
cricket
chitchat
what
was
it
jellicoe
wanted
asked
mike
was
it
anything
important
he
seemed
to
think
so
he
kept
telling
me
to
tell
you
to
go
and
see
him
i
fear
comrade
jellicoe
is
a
bit
of
a
blitherer
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
rag
we
worked
off
on
jellicoe
once
asked
dunster
the
man
has
absolutely
no
sense
of
humor
ca
see
when
being
rotted
well
it
was
like
this
hello
we
all
out
i
shall
have
to
be
going
out
to
field
again
i
suppose
dash
it
i
tell
you
when
i
see
you
again
i
shall
count
the
minutes
said
psmith
mike
stretched
himself
the
sun
was
very
soothing
after
his
two
hours
in
the
detention
room
he
felt
disinclined
for
exertion
i
do
suppose
it
anything
special
about
jellicoe
do
you
he
said
i
mean
it
keep
till
teatime
it
no
catch
having
to
sweat
across
to
the
house
now
do
dream
of
moving
said
psmith
i
have
several
rather
profound
observations
on
life
to
make
and
i
ca
make
them
without
an
audience
soliloquy
is
a
knack
hamlet
had
got
it
but
probably
only
after
years
of
patient
practice
personally
i
need
someone
to
listen
when
i
talk
i
like
to
feel
that
i
am
doing
good
you
stay
where
you
are
interrupt
too
much
mike
tilted
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
abandoned
jellicoe
it
was
not
until
the
bell
rang
that
he
remembered
him
he
went
over
to
the
house
and
made
his
way
to
the
dormitory
where
he
found
the
injured
one
in
a
parlous
state
not
so
much
physical
as
mental
the
doctor
had
seen
his
ankle
and
reported
that
it
would
be
on
the
active
list
in
a
couple
of
days
it
was
jellicoe
mind
that
needed
attention
now
mike
found
him
in
a
condition
bordering
on
collapse
i
say
you
might
have
come
before
said
jellicoe
what
up
i
did
know
there
was
such
a
hurry
about
it
what
did
you
want
it
no
good
now
said
jellicoe
gloomily
it
too
late
i
shall
get
sacked
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
what
the
row
it
about
that
money
what
about
it
i
had
to
pay
it
to
a
man
today
or
he
said
he
write
to
the
head
then
of
course
i
should
get
sacked
i
was
going
to
take
the
money
to
him
this
afternoon
only
i
got
crocked
so
i
could
move
i
wanted
to
get
hold
of
you
to
ask
you
to
take
it
for
me
it
too
late
now
mike
face
fell
oh
hang
it
he
said
i
awfully
sorry
i
no
idea
it
was
anything
like
that
what
a
fool
i
was
dunster
did
say
he
thought
it
was
something
important
only
like
an
ass
i
thought
it
would
do
if
i
came
over
at
lockup
it
does
matter
said
jellicoe
miserably
it
ca
be
helped
yes
it
can
said
mike
i
know
what
i
do
it
all
right
i
get
out
of
the
house
after
jellicoe
sat
up
you
ca
you
get
sacked
if
you
were
caught
who
would
catch
me
there
was
a
chap
at
wrykyn
i
knew
who
used
to
break
out
every
night
nearly
and
go
and
pot
at
cats
with
an
air
pistol
as
easy
as
anything
the
expression
began
to
fade
from
jellicoe
face
i
say
do
you
think
you
could
really
of
course
i
can
it
be
rather
a
rag
i
say
it
frightfully
decent
of
you
what
absolute
rot
but
look
here
are
you
certain
i
shall
be
all
right
where
do
you
want
me
to
go
it
a
place
about
a
mile
or
two
from
here
called
lower
borlock
lower
borlock
yes
do
you
know
it
rather
i
been
playing
cricket
for
them
all
the
term
i
say
have
you
do
you
know
a
man
called
barley
barley
rather
he
runs
the
white
boar
he
the
chap
i
owe
the
money
to
old
barley
mike
knew
the
landlord
of
the
white
boar
well
he
was
the
wag
of
the
village
team
every
village
team
for
some
mysterious
reason
has
its
comic
man
in
the
lower
borlock
eleven
mr
barley
filled
the
post
he
was
a
large
stout
man
with
a
red
and
cheerful
face
who
looked
exactly
like
the
jovial
innkeeper
of
melodrama
he
was
the
last
man
mike
would
have
expected
to
do
the
money
by
or
i
write
to
the
headmaster
business
but
he
reflected
that
he
had
only
seen
him
in
his
leisure
moments
when
he
might
naturally
be
expected
to
unbend
and
be
full
of
the
milk
of
human
kindness
probably
in
business
hours
he
was
quite
different
after
all
pleasure
is
one
thing
and
business
another
besides
five
pounds
is
a
large
sum
of
money
and
if
jellicoe
owed
it
there
was
nothing
strange
in
mr
barley
doing
everything
he
could
to
recover
it
he
wondered
a
little
what
jellicoe
could
have
been
doing
to
run
up
a
bill
as
big
as
that
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
ask
which
was
unfortunate
as
it
might
have
saved
him
a
good
deal
of
inconvenience
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
to
inquire
into
jellicoe
private
affairs
he
took
the
envelope
containing
the
money
without
question
i
shall
bike
there
i
think
he
said
if
i
can
get
into
the
shed
the
school
bicycles
were
stored
in
a
shed
by
the
pavilion
you
can
manage
that
said
jellicoe
it
locked
up
at
night
but
i
had
a
key
made
to
fit
it
last
summer
because
i
used
to
get
out
in
the
early
morning
sometimes
before
it
was
opened
got
it
on
you
smith
got
it
i
get
it
from
him
i
say
well
do
tell
smith
why
you
want
it
will
you
i
do
want
anybody
to
know
if
a
thing
once
starts
getting
about
it
all
over
the
place
in
no
time
all
right
i
wo
tell
him
i
say
thanks
most
awfully
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
i
oh
chuck
it
said
mike
and
fulfills
it
mike
started
on
his
ride
to
lower
borlock
with
mixed
feelings
it
is
pleasant
to
be
out
on
a
fine
night
in
summer
but
the
pleasure
is
to
a
certain
extent
modified
when
one
feels
that
to
be
detected
will
mean
expulsion
mike
did
not
want
to
be
expelled
for
many
reasons
now
that
he
had
grown
used
to
the
place
he
was
enjoying
himself
at
sedleigh
to
a
certain
extent
he
still
harbored
a
feeling
of
resentment
against
the
school
in
general
and
adair
in
particular
but
it
was
pleasant
in
outwood
now
that
he
had
got
to
know
some
of
the
members
of
the
house
and
he
liked
playing
cricket
for
lower
borlock
also
he
was
fairly
certain
that
his
father
would
not
let
him
go
to
cambridge
if
he
were
expelled
from
sedleigh
jackson
was
easygoing
with
his
family
but
occasionally
his
foot
came
down
like
a
steam
hammer
as
witness
the
wrykyn
affair
so
mike
pedaled
along
rapidly
being
wishful
to
get
the
job
done
without
delay
psmith
had
yielded
up
the
key
but
his
inquiries
as
to
why
it
was
needed
had
been
embarrassing
mike
statement
that
he
wanted
to
get
up
early
and
have
a
ride
had
been
received
by
psmith
with
whom
early
rising
was
not
a
hobby
with
honest
amazement
and
a
flood
of
advice
and
warning
on
the
subject
one
of
the
georges
said
psmith
i
forget
which
once
said
that
a
certain
number
of
hours
sleep
a
day
i
can
not
recall
for
the
moment
how
many
made
a
man
something
which
for
the
time
being
has
slipped
my
memory
however
there
you
are
i
given
you
the
main
idea
of
the
thing
and
a
german
doctor
says
that
early
rising
causes
insanity
still
if
you
bent
on
it
after
which
he
had
handed
over
the
key
mike
wished
he
could
have
taken
psmith
into
his
confidence
probably
he
would
have
volunteered
to
come
too
mike
would
have
been
glad
of
a
companion
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
reach
lower
borlock
the
white
boar
stood
at
the
far
end
of
the
village
by
the
cricket
field
he
rode
past
the
church
standing
out
black
and
mysterious
against
the
light
sky
and
the
rows
of
silent
cottages
until
he
came
to
the
inn
the
place
was
shut
of
course
and
all
the
lights
were
out
it
was
sometime
past
eleven
the
advantage
an
inn
has
over
a
private
house
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
person
who
wants
to
get
into
it
when
it
has
been
locked
up
is
that
a
nocturnal
visit
is
not
so
unexpected
in
the
case
of
the
former
preparations
have
been
made
to
meet
such
an
emergency
where
with
a
private
house
you
would
probably
have
to
wander
around
heaving
rocks
and
end
by
climbing
up
a
waterspout
when
you
want
to
get
into
an
inn
you
simply
ring
the
night
bell
which
communicating
with
the
boots
room
has
that
menial
up
and
doing
in
no
time
after
mike
had
waited
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
rattling
of
chains
and
a
shooting
of
bolts
and
the
door
opened
yes
sir
said
the
boots
appearing
in
his
shirt
sleeves
why
jackson
sir
mike
was
well
known
to
all
dwellers
in
lower
borlock
his
scores
being
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
when
the
day
labors
were
over
i
want
to
see
mr
barley
jack
he
bin
in
bed
this
half
hour
back
mr
jackson
i
must
see
him
can
you
get
him
down
the
boots
looked
doubtful
roust
the
outer
bed
he
said
mike
quite
admitted
the
gravity
of
the
task
the
landlord
of
the
white
boar
was
one
of
those
men
who
need
a
beauty
sleep
i
wish
you
would
it
a
thing
that
ca
wait
i
got
some
money
to
give
to
him
oh
if
it
said
the
boots
five
minutes
later
mine
host
appeared
in
person
looking
more
than
usually
portly
in
a
check
dressing
gown
and
red
bedroom
slippers
you
can
pop
off
jack
exit
boots
to
his
slumbers
once
more
well
jackson
what
it
all
about
jellicoe
asked
me
to
come
and
bring
you
the
money
the
money
what
money
what
he
owes
you
the
five
pounds
of
course
the
five
mr
barley
stared
openmouthed
at
mike
for
a
moment
then
he
broke
into
a
roar
of
laughter
which
shook
the
sporting
prints
on
the
wall
and
drew
barks
from
dogs
in
some
distant
part
of
the
house
he
staggered
about
laughing
and
coughing
till
mike
began
to
expect
a
fit
of
some
kind
then
he
collapsed
into
a
chair
which
creaked
under
him
and
wiped
his
eyes
oh
dear
he
said
oh
dear
the
five
pounds
mike
was
not
always
abreast
of
the
rustic
idea
of
humor
and
now
he
felt
particularly
fogged
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
see
what
there
was
to
amuse
anyone
so
much
in
the
fact
that
a
person
who
owed
five
pounds
was
ready
to
pay
it
back
it
was
an
occasion
for
rejoicing
perhaps
but
rather
for
a
solemn
thankful
kind
of
rejoicing
what
up
he
asked
five
pounds
you
might
tell
us
the
joke
mr
barley
opened
the
letter
read
it
and
had
another
attack
when
this
was
finished
he
handed
the
letter
to
mike
who
was
waiting
patiently
by
hoping
for
light
and
requested
him
to
read
it
dear
dear
chuckled
mr
barley
five
pounds
they
may
teach
you
young
gentlemen
to
talk
latin
and
greek
and
at
your
school
but
it
do
a
lot
more
good
if
they
teach
you
how
many
beans
make
five
it
do
a
lot
more
good
if
they
teach
you
to
come
in
when
it
rained
it
do
mike
was
reading
the
letter
dear
mr
barley
it
ran
i
send
the
which
i
could
not
get
before
i
hope
it
is
in
time
because
i
do
want
you
to
write
to
the
headmaster
i
am
sorry
jane
and
john
ate
your
wife
hat
and
the
chicken
and
broke
the
vase
there
was
some
more
to
the
same
effect
it
was
signed
jellicoe
what
on
earth
it
all
about
said
mike
finishing
this
curious
document
mr
barley
slapped
his
leg
why
jellicoe
keeps
two
dogs
here
i
keep
for
him
till
the
young
gentlemen
go
home
for
their
holidays
aberdeen
terriers
they
are
and
as
sharp
as
mustard
mischief
i
believe
you
but
love
us
they
do
do
no
harm
bite
up
an
old
shoe
sometimes
and
such
sort
of
things
the
other
day
last
wednesday
it
were
about
parse
five
jane
she
the
worst
of
the
two
always
up
to
it
she
is
she
got
hold
of
my
old
hat
and
had
it
in
bits
before
you
could
say
knife
john
upset
a
china
vase
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
chasing
a
mouse
and
they
got
on
the
table
and
ate
half
a
cold
chicken
what
had
been
left
there
so
i
says
to
myself
have
a
game
with
jellicoe
over
this
and
i
sits
down
and
writes
off
saying
the
little
dogs
have
eaten
a
valuable
hat
and
a
chicken
and
what
not
and
the
damage
be
five
pounds
and
will
he
kindly
remit
same
by
saturday
night
at
the
latest
or
i
write
to
his
headmaster
love
us
mr
barley
slapped
his
thigh
he
took
it
all
in
every
word
and
here
the
five
pounds
in
cash
in
this
envelope
here
i
have
had
such
a
laugh
since
we
got
old
tom
raxley
out
of
bed
at
twelve
of
a
winter
night
by
telling
him
his
house
was
afire
it
is
not
always
easy
to
appreciate
a
joke
of
the
practical
order
if
one
has
been
made
even
merely
part
victim
of
it
mike
as
he
reflected
that
he
had
been
dragged
out
of
his
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
contravention
of
all
school
rules
and
discipline
simply
in
order
to
satisfy
mr
barley
sense
of
humor
was
more
inclined
to
be
abusive
than
mirthful
running
risks
is
all
very
well
when
they
are
necessary
or
if
one
chooses
to
run
them
for
one
own
amusement
but
to
be
placed
in
a
dangerous
position
a
position
imperiling
one
chance
of
going
to
the
is
another
matter
altogether
but
it
is
impossible
to
abuse
the
barley
type
of
man
barley
enjoyment
of
the
whole
thing
was
so
honest
and
childlike
probably
it
had
given
him
the
happiest
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
known
for
years
since
in
fact
the
affair
of
old
tom
raxley
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
damp
the
man
so
mike
laughed
perfunctorily
took
back
the
envelope
with
the
five
pounds
accepted
a
ginger
beer
and
a
plateful
of
biscuits
and
rode
off
on
his
return
journey
mention
has
been
made
above
of
the
difference
which
exists
between
getting
into
an
inn
after
lockup
and
into
a
private
house
mike
was
to
find
this
out
for
himself
his
first
act
on
arriving
at
sedleigh
was
to
replace
his
bicycle
in
the
shed
this
he
accomplished
with
success
it
was
in
the
shed
and
as
he
wheeled
his
machine
in
his
foot
touched
something
on
the
floor
without
waiting
to
discover
what
this
might
be
he
leaned
his
bicycle
against
the
wall
went
out
and
locked
the
door
after
which
he
ran
across
to
outwood
fortune
had
favored
his
undertaking
by
decreeing
that
a
stout
drainpipe
should
pass
up
the
wall
within
a
few
inches
of
his
and
psmith
study
on
the
first
day
of
term
it
may
be
remembered
he
had
wrenched
away
the
wooden
bar
which
bisected
the
window
frame
thus
rendering
exit
and
entrance
almost
as
simple
as
they
had
been
for
wyatt
during
mike
first
term
at
wrykyn
he
proceeded
to
scale
this
water
pipe
he
had
got
about
halfway
up
when
a
voice
from
somewhere
below
cried
who
that
pursuit
these
things
are
life
little
difficulties
one
can
never
tell
precisely
how
one
will
act
in
a
sudden
emergency
the
right
thing
for
mike
to
have
done
at
this
crisis
was
to
have
ignored
the
voice
carried
on
up
the
water
pipe
and
through
the
study
window
and
gone
to
bed
it
was
extremely
unlikely
that
anybody
could
have
recognized
him
at
night
against
the
dark
background
of
the
house
the
position
then
would
have
been
that
somebody
in
outwood
house
had
been
seen
breaking
in
after
but
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
the
authorities
to
have
narrowed
the
search
down
any
further
than
that
there
were
boys
in
outwood
of
whom
about
fourteen
were
much
the
same
size
and
build
as
mike
the
suddenness
however
of
the
call
caused
mike
to
lose
his
head
he
made
the
strategic
error
of
sliding
rapidly
down
the
pipe
and
running
there
were
two
gates
to
outwood
front
garden
the
drive
ran
in
a
semicircle
of
which
the
house
was
the
center
it
was
from
the
gate
nearest
to
mr
downing
house
that
the
voice
had
come
and
as
mike
came
to
the
ground
he
saw
a
stout
figure
galloping
toward
him
from
that
direction
he
bolted
like
a
rabbit
for
the
other
gate
as
he
did
so
his
pursuer
again
gave
tongue
yer
was
the
exact
remark
whereby
mike
recognized
him
as
the
school
sergeant
yer
was
that
militant
gentleman
habitual
way
of
beginning
a
conversation
with
this
knowledge
mike
felt
easier
in
his
mind
sergeant
collard
was
a
man
of
many
fine
qualities
notably
a
talent
for
what
he
was
wont
to
call
a
mysterious
gift
which
he
exercised
on
the
rifle
range
but
he
could
not
run
there
had
been
a
time
in
his
hot
youth
when
he
had
sprinted
like
an
untamed
mustang
in
pursuit
of
volatile
pathans
in
indian
hill
wars
but
time
increasing
his
girth
had
taken
from
him
the
taste
for
such
exercise
when
he
moved
now
it
was
at
a
stately
walk
the
fact
that
he
ran
tonight
showed
how
the
excitement
of
the
chase
had
entered
into
his
blood
yer
he
shouted
again
as
mike
passing
through
the
gate
turned
into
the
road
that
led
to
the
school
mike
attentive
ear
noted
that
the
bright
speech
was
a
shade
more
puffily
delivered
this
time
he
began
to
feel
that
this
was
not
such
bad
fun
after
all
he
would
have
liked
to
be
in
bed
but
if
that
was
out
of
the
question
this
was
certainly
the
thing
he
ran
on
taking
things
easily
with
the
sergeant
panting
in
his
wake
till
he
reached
the
entrance
to
the
school
grounds
he
dashed
in
and
took
cover
behind
a
tree
presently
the
sergeant
turned
the
corner
going
badly
and
evidently
cured
of
a
good
deal
of
the
fever
of
the
chase
mike
heard
him
toil
on
for
a
few
yards
and
then
stop
a
sound
of
panting
was
borne
to
him
then
the
sound
of
footsteps
returning
this
time
at
a
walk
they
passed
the
gate
and
went
on
down
the
road
the
pursuer
had
given
the
thing
up
mike
waited
for
several
minutes
behind
his
tree
his
program
now
was
simple
he
would
give
sergeant
collard
about
half
an
hour
in
case
the
latter
took
it
into
his
head
to
guard
home
by
waiting
at
the
gate
then
he
would
trot
softly
back
shoot
up
the
water
pipe
once
more
and
so
to
bed
it
had
just
struck
a
quarter
to
something
twelve
he
supposed
on
the
school
clock
he
would
wait
till
a
quarter
past
meanwhile
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
from
lurking
behind
a
tree
he
left
his
cover
and
started
to
stroll
in
the
direction
of
the
pavilion
having
arrived
there
he
sat
on
the
steps
looking
out
onto
the
cricket
field
his
thoughts
were
miles
away
at
wrykyn
when
he
was
recalled
to
sedleigh
by
the
sound
of
somebody
running
focusing
his
gaze
he
saw
a
dim
figure
moving
rapidly
across
the
cricket
field
straight
for
him
his
first
impression
that
he
had
been
seen
and
followed
disappeared
as
the
runner
instead
of
making
for
the
pavilion
turned
aside
and
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
bicycle
shed
like
mike
he
was
evidently
possessed
of
a
key
for
mike
heard
it
grate
in
the
lock
at
this
point
he
left
the
pavilion
and
hailed
his
fellow
rambler
by
night
in
a
cautious
undertone
the
other
appeared
startled
who
the
dickens
is
that
he
asked
is
that
you
jackson
mike
recognized
adair
voice
the
last
person
he
would
have
expected
to
meet
at
midnight
obviously
on
the
point
of
going
for
a
bicycle
ride
what
are
you
doing
out
here
jackson
what
are
you
if
it
comes
to
that
adair
was
adjusting
his
front
light
i
going
for
the
doctor
one
of
the
chaps
in
our
house
is
bad
oh
what
are
you
doing
out
here
just
been
for
a
stroll
had
you
better
be
getting
back
plenty
of
time
i
suppose
you
think
you
doing
something
tremendously
brave
and
dashing
had
you
better
be
going
to
the
doctor
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
i
do
so
long
mike
turned
away
whistling
between
his
teeth
after
a
moment
pause
adair
rode
off
mike
saw
his
light
pass
across
the
field
and
through
the
gate
the
school
clock
struck
the
quarter
it
seemed
to
mike
that
sergeant
collard
even
if
he
had
started
to
wait
for
him
at
the
house
would
not
keep
up
the
vigil
for
more
than
half
an
hour
he
would
be
safe
now
in
trying
for
home
again
he
walked
in
that
direction
now
it
happened
that
mr
downing
aroused
from
his
first
sleep
by
the
news
conveyed
to
him
by
adair
that
macphee
one
of
the
junior
members
of
adair
dormitory
was
groaning
and
exhibiting
other
symptoms
of
acute
illness
was
disturbed
in
his
mind
most
housemasters
feel
uneasy
in
the
event
of
illness
in
their
houses
and
mr
downing
was
apt
to
get
jumpy
beyond
the
ordinary
on
such
occasions
all
that
was
wrong
with
macphee
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
very
fair
stomachache
the
direct
and
legitimate
result
of
eating
six
buns
half
a
coconut
three
doughnuts
two
ices
an
apple
and
a
pound
of
cherries
and
washing
the
lot
down
with
tea
but
mr
downing
saw
in
his
attack
the
beginnings
of
some
deadly
scourge
which
would
sweep
through
and
decimate
the
house
he
had
dispatched
adair
for
the
doctor
and
after
spending
a
few
minutes
prowling
restlessly
about
his
room
was
now
standing
at
his
front
gate
waiting
for
adair
return
it
came
about
therefore
that
mike
sprinting
lightly
in
the
direction
of
home
and
safety
had
his
already
shaken
nerves
further
maltreated
by
being
hailed
at
a
range
of
about
two
yards
with
a
cry
of
is
that
you
adair
the
next
moment
mr
downing
emerged
from
his
gate
mike
stood
not
upon
the
order
of
his
going
he
was
off
like
an
arrow
a
flying
figure
of
guilt
mr
downing
after
the
first
surprise
seemed
to
grasp
the
situation
ejaculating
at
intervals
the
words
who
is
that
stop
who
is
that
stop
he
dashed
after
the
wrykynian
at
an
extremely
creditable
rate
of
speed
mr
downing
was
by
way
of
being
a
sprinter
he
had
won
handicap
events
at
college
sports
at
oxford
and
if
mike
had
not
got
such
a
good
start
the
race
might
have
been
over
in
the
first
fifty
yards
as
it
was
that
victim
of
fate
going
well
kept
ahead
at
the
entrance
to
the
school
grounds
he
led
by
a
dozen
yards
the
procession
passed
into
the
field
mike
heading
as
before
for
the
pavilion
as
they
raced
across
the
soft
turf
an
idea
occurred
to
mike
which
he
was
accustomed
in
after
years
to
attribute
to
genius
the
one
flash
of
it
which
had
ever
illumined
his
life
it
was
this
one
of
mr
downing
first
acts
on
starting
the
fire
brigade
at
sedleigh
had
been
to
institute
an
alarm
bell
it
had
been
rubbed
into
the
school
officially
in
speeches
from
the
dais
by
the
headmaster
and
unofficially
in
earnest
private
conversations
by
mr
downing
that
at
the
sound
of
this
bell
at
whatever
hour
of
day
or
night
every
member
of
the
school
must
leave
his
house
in
the
quickest
possible
way
and
make
for
the
open
the
bell
might
mean
that
the
school
was
on
fire
or
it
might
mean
that
one
of
the
houses
was
on
fire
in
any
case
the
school
had
its
orders
to
get
out
into
the
open
at
once
nor
must
it
be
supposed
that
the
school
was
without
practice
at
this
feat
every
now
and
then
a
notice
would
be
found
posted
up
on
the
board
to
the
effect
that
there
would
be
fire
drill
during
the
dinner
hour
that
day
sometimes
the
performance
was
bright
and
interesting
as
on
the
occasion
when
mr
downing
marshaling
the
brigade
at
his
front
gate
had
said
my
house
is
supposed
to
be
on
fire
now
let
do
a
record
which
the
brigade
headed
by
stone
and
robinson
obligingly
did
they
fastened
the
hose
to
the
hydrant
smashed
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
mr
downing
having
retired
for
a
moment
to
talk
with
the
headmaster
and
poured
a
stream
of
water
into
the
room
when
mr
downing
was
at
liberty
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
matter
he
found
that
the
room
selected
was
his
private
study
most
of
the
light
furniture
of
which
was
floating
in
a
miniature
lake
that
episode
had
rather
discouraged
his
passion
for
realism
and
fire
drill
since
then
had
taken
the
form
for
the
most
part
of
practicing
escaping
this
was
done
by
means
of
canvas
chutes
kept
in
the
dormitories
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
the
prefect
of
the
dormitory
would
heave
one
end
of
the
chute
out
of
the
window
the
other
end
being
fastened
to
the
sill
he
would
then
go
down
it
himself
using
his
elbows
as
a
brake
then
the
second
man
would
follow
his
example
and
these
two
standing
below
would
hold
the
end
of
the
chute
so
that
the
rest
of
the
dormitory
could
fly
rapidly
down
it
without
injury
except
to
their
digestions
after
the
first
novelty
of
the
thing
had
worn
off
the
school
had
taken
a
rooted
dislike
to
fire
drill
it
was
a
matter
for
among
them
that
mr
downing
had
never
been
able
to
induce
the
headmaster
to
allow
the
alarm
bell
to
be
sounded
for
fire
drill
at
night
the
headmaster
a
man
who
had
his
views
on
the
amount
of
sleep
necessary
for
the
growing
boy
had
drawn
the
line
at
night
operations
sufficient
unto
the
day
had
been
the
gist
of
his
reply
if
the
alarm
bell
were
to
ring
at
night
when
there
was
no
fire
the
school
might
mistake
a
genuine
alarm
of
fire
for
a
bogus
one
and
refuse
to
hurry
themselves
so
mr
downing
had
had
to
be
content
with
day
drill
the
alarm
bell
hung
in
the
archway
leading
into
the
school
grounds
the
end
of
the
rope
when
not
in
use
was
fastened
to
a
hook
halfway
up
the
wall
mike
as
he
raced
over
the
cricket
field
made
up
his
mind
in
a
flash
that
his
only
chance
of
getting
out
of
this
tangle
was
to
shake
his
pursuer
off
for
a
space
of
time
long
enough
to
enable
him
to
get
to
the
rope
and
tug
it
then
the
school
would
come
out
he
would
mix
with
them
and
in
the
subsequent
confusion
get
back
to
bed
unnoticed
the
task
was
easier
than
it
would
have
seemed
at
the
beginning
of
the
chase
mr
downing
owing
to
the
two
facts
that
he
was
not
in
the
strictest
training
and
that
it
is
only
a
bannister
who
can
run
for
any
length
of
time
at
top
speed
shouting
who
is
that
stop
who
is
that
stop
was
beginning
to
feel
distressed
there
were
bellows
to
mend
in
the
downing
camp
mike
perceived
this
and
forced
the
pace
he
rounded
the
pavilion
ten
yards
to
the
good
then
heading
for
the
gate
he
put
all
he
knew
into
one
last
sprint
mr
downing
was
not
equal
to
the
effort
he
worked
gamely
for
a
few
strides
then
fell
behind
when
mike
reached
the
gate
a
good
forty
yards
separated
them
as
far
as
mike
could
judge
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
make
nice
calculations
he
had
about
four
seconds
in
which
to
get
busy
with
that
bell
rope
probably
nobody
has
ever
crammed
more
energetic
work
into
four
seconds
than
he
did
then
the
night
was
as
still
as
only
an
english
summer
night
can
be
and
the
first
clang
of
the
clapper
sounded
like
a
million
iron
girders
falling
from
a
height
onto
a
sheet
of
tin
he
tugged
away
furiously
with
an
eye
on
the
now
rapidly
advancing
and
loudly
shouting
figure
of
the
housemaster
and
from
the
darkened
house
beyond
there
came
a
gradually
swelling
hum
as
if
a
vast
hive
of
bees
had
been
disturbed
the
school
was
awake
the
decoration
of
sammy
psmith
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
in
the
senior
day
room
at
outwood
since
mike
innings
against
downing
the
lost
lambs
had
been
received
as
brothers
by
the
center
of
disorder
so
that
even
spiller
was
compelled
to
look
on
the
hatchet
as
buried
and
gave
his
views
on
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
or
rather
of
that
morning
for
it
was
nearer
one
than
twelve
when
peace
had
once
more
fallen
on
the
school
nothing
that
happens
in
this
loony
bin
said
psmith
has
power
to
surprise
me
now
there
was
a
time
when
i
might
have
thought
it
a
little
unusual
to
have
to
leave
the
house
through
a
canvas
chute
at
one
in
the
morning
but
i
suppose
it
quite
the
regular
thing
here
old
school
tradition
etc
men
leave
the
school
and
find
that
they
got
so
accustomed
to
jumping
out
of
windows
that
they
look
on
it
as
a
sort
of
affectation
to
go
out
by
the
door
i
suppose
none
of
you
merchants
can
give
me
any
idea
when
the
next
knockabout
entertainment
of
this
kind
is
likely
to
take
place
i
wonder
who
rang
that
bell
said
stone
jolly
sporting
idea
i
believe
it
was
downing
himself
if
it
was
i
hope
he
satisfied
jellicoe
who
was
appearing
in
society
supported
by
a
stick
looked
meaningly
at
mike
and
giggled
receiving
in
answer
a
stony
stare
mike
had
informed
jellicoe
of
the
details
of
his
interview
with
mr
barley
at
the
white
boar
and
jellicoe
after
a
momentary
splutter
of
wrath
against
the
practical
joker
was
now
in
a
particular
lighthearted
mood
he
hobbled
about
giggling
at
nothing
and
at
peace
with
all
the
world
it
was
a
stirring
scene
said
psmith
the
agility
with
which
comrade
jellicoe
boosted
himself
down
the
chute
was
a
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
he
seemed
to
forget
his
ankle
it
was
the
nearest
thing
to
a
boneless
acrobatic
wonder
that
i
have
ever
seen
i
was
in
a
beastly
funk
i
can
tell
you
stone
gurgled
so
was
i
he
said
for
a
bit
then
when
i
saw
that
it
was
all
a
rag
i
began
to
look
about
for
ways
of
doing
the
thing
really
well
i
emptied
about
six
jugs
of
water
on
a
gang
of
kids
under
my
window
i
rushed
into
downing
and
ragged
some
of
the
beds
said
robinson
it
was
an
invigorating
time
said
psmith
a
sort
of
pageant
i
was
particularly
struck
with
the
way
some
of
the
bright
lads
caught
hold
of
the
idea
there
was
no
skimping
some
of
the
kids
to
my
certain
knowledge
went
down
the
chute
a
dozen
times
there
nothing
like
doing
a
thing
thoroughly
i
saw
them
come
down
rush
upstairs
and
be
saved
again
time
after
time
the
thing
became
chronic
with
them
i
should
say
comrade
downing
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
the
high
state
of
efficiency
to
which
he
has
brought
us
at
any
rate
i
hope
there
was
a
sound
of
hurried
footsteps
outside
the
door
and
sharpe
a
member
of
the
senior
day
room
burst
excitedly
in
he
seemed
amused
i
say
have
you
chaps
seen
sammy
seen
who
said
stone
sammy
why
you
know
in
a
second
he
just
outside
here
sammy
sammy
sammy
sam
sam
a
bark
and
a
patter
of
feet
outside
come
on
sammy
good
dog
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
a
great
yell
of
laughter
burst
forth
even
psmith
massive
calm
was
shattered
as
for
jellicoe
he
sobbed
in
a
corner
sammy
beautiful
white
coat
was
almost
entirely
concealed
by
a
thick
covering
of
paint
his
head
with
the
exception
of
the
ears
was
untouched
and
his
serious
friendly
eyes
seemed
to
emphasise
the
weirdness
of
his
appearance
he
stood
in
the
doorway
barking
and
wagging
his
tail
plainly
puzzled
at
his
reception
he
was
a
popular
dog
and
was
always
well
received
when
he
visited
any
of
the
houses
but
he
had
never
before
met
with
enthusiasm
like
this
good
old
sammy
what
on
earth
been
happening
to
him
who
did
it
sharpe
the
introducer
had
no
views
on
the
matter
i
found
him
outside
downing
with
a
crowd
round
him
everybody
seems
to
have
seen
him
i
wonder
who
on
earth
has
gone
and
mucked
him
up
like
that
mike
was
the
first
to
show
any
sympathy
for
the
maltreated
animal
poor
old
sammy
he
said
kneeling
on
the
floor
beside
the
victim
and
scratching
him
under
the
ear
what
a
beastly
shame
it
take
hours
to
wash
all
that
off
him
and
he
hate
it
it
seems
to
me
said
psmith
regarding
sammy
dispassionately
through
his
eyeglass
that
it
not
a
case
for
mere
washing
they
either
have
to
skin
him
bodily
or
leave
the
thing
to
time
time
the
great
healer
in
a
year
or
two
he
fade
to
a
delicate
pink
i
do
see
why
you
should
have
a
pink
bull
terrier
it
would
lend
a
touch
of
distinction
to
the
place
crowds
would
come
in
excursion
trains
to
see
him
by
charging
a
small
fee
you
might
make
him
i
think
i
suggest
it
to
comrade
downing
there
be
a
row
about
this
said
stone
rows
are
rather
sport
when
you
not
mixed
up
in
them
said
robinson
philosophically
there
be
another
if
we
do
start
off
for
chapel
soon
it
a
quarter
to
there
was
a
general
move
mike
was
the
last
to
leave
the
room
as
he
was
going
jellicoe
stopped
him
jellicoe
was
staying
in
that
sunday
owing
to
his
ankle
i
say
said
jellicoe
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
again
about
that
oh
that
all
right
no
but
it
really
was
awfully
decent
of
you
you
might
have
got
into
a
frightful
row
were
you
nearly
caught
jolly
nearly
it
you
who
rang
the
bell
was
it
yes
it
was
but
for
goodness
sake
do
go
gassing
about
it
or
somebody
will
get
to
hear
who
ought
to
and
i
shall
be
sacked
all
right
but
i
say
you
a
chap
what
the
matter
now
i
mean
about
sammy
you
know
it
a
jolly
good
score
off
old
downing
he
be
frightfully
sick
sammy
cried
mike
my
good
man
you
do
think
i
did
that
do
you
what
absolute
rot
i
never
touched
the
poor
brute
oh
all
right
said
jellicoe
but
i
was
going
to
tell
anyone
of
course
what
do
you
mean
you
a
chap
giggled
jellicoe
mike
walked
to
chapel
rather
thoughtfully
mr
downing
on
the
scent
there
was
just
one
moment
the
moment
in
which
on
going
down
to
the
junior
day
room
of
his
house
to
quell
an
unseemly
disturbance
he
was
boisterously
greeted
by
a
vermilion
bull
terrier
when
mr
downing
was
seized
with
a
hideous
fear
lest
he
had
lost
his
senses
glaring
down
at
the
crimson
animal
that
was
pawing
at
his
knees
he
clutched
at
his
reason
for
one
second
as
a
drowning
man
clutches
at
a
life
belt
then
the
happy
laughter
of
the
young
onlookers
reassured
him
who
he
shouted
who
has
done
this
please
sir
we
do
know
shrilled
the
chorus
please
sir
he
came
in
like
that
please
sir
we
were
sitting
here
when
he
suddenly
ran
in
all
red
a
voice
from
the
crowd
look
at
old
sammy
the
situation
was
impossible
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
he
could
not
find
out
by
verbal
inquiry
who
had
painted
the
dog
the
possibility
of
sammy
being
painted
red
during
the
night
had
never
occurred
to
mr
downing
and
now
that
the
thing
had
happened
he
had
no
scheme
of
action
as
psmith
would
have
said
he
had
confused
the
unusual
with
the
impossible
and
the
result
was
that
he
was
taken
by
surprise
while
he
was
pondering
on
this
the
situation
was
rendered
still
more
difficult
by
sammy
who
taking
advantage
of
the
door
being
open
escaped
and
rushed
into
the
road
thus
publishing
his
condition
to
all
and
sundry
you
can
hush
up
a
painted
dog
while
it
confines
itself
to
your
own
premises
but
once
it
has
mixed
with
the
great
public
this
becomes
out
of
the
question
sammy
state
advanced
from
a
private
trouble
into
a
row
mr
downing
next
move
was
in
the
same
direction
that
sammy
had
taken
only
instead
of
running
about
the
road
he
went
straight
to
the
headmaster
the
head
who
had
had
to
leave
his
house
in
the
small
hours
in
his
pajamas
and
a
dressing
gown
was
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
he
had
a
cold
in
the
head
and
also
a
rooted
conviction
that
mr
downing
in
spite
of
his
strict
orders
had
rung
the
bell
himself
on
the
previous
night
in
order
to
test
the
efficiency
of
the
school
in
saving
themselves
in
the
event
of
fire
he
received
the
housemaster
frostily
but
thawed
as
the
latter
related
the
events
which
had
led
up
to
the
ringing
of
the
bell
dear
me
he
said
deeply
interested
one
of
the
boys
at
the
school
you
think
i
am
certain
of
it
said
mr
downing
was
he
wearing
a
school
cap
he
was
bareheaded
a
boy
who
breaks
out
of
his
house
at
night
would
hardly
run
the
risk
of
wearing
a
distinguishing
cap
no
no
i
suppose
not
a
big
boy
you
say
very
big
you
did
not
see
his
face
it
was
dark
and
he
never
looked
back
he
was
in
front
of
me
all
the
time
dear
me
there
is
another
matter
yes
this
boy
whoever
he
was
had
done
something
before
he
rang
the
bell
he
had
painted
my
dog
sampson
red
the
headmaster
eyes
protruded
from
their
sockets
he
he
mr
downing
he
painted
my
dog
red
bright
red
mr
downing
was
too
angry
to
see
anything
humorous
in
the
incident
since
the
previous
night
he
had
been
wounded
in
his
tenderest
feelings
his
fire
brigade
system
had
been
most
shamefully
abused
by
being
turned
into
a
mere
instrument
in
the
hands
of
a
malefactor
for
escaping
justice
and
his
dog
had
been
held
up
to
ridicule
to
all
the
world
he
did
not
want
to
smile
he
wanted
revenge
the
headmaster
on
the
other
hand
did
want
to
smile
it
was
not
his
dog
he
could
look
on
the
affair
with
an
unbiased
eye
and
to
him
there
was
something
ludicrous
in
a
white
dog
suddenly
appearing
as
a
red
dog
it
is
a
scandalous
thing
said
mr
downing
quite
so
quite
so
said
the
headmaster
hastily
i
shall
punish
the
boy
who
did
it
most
severely
i
will
speak
to
the
school
in
the
hall
after
chapel
which
he
did
but
without
result
a
cordial
invitation
to
the
criminal
to
come
forward
and
be
executed
was
received
in
wooden
silence
by
the
school
with
the
exception
of
johnson
iii
of
outwood
who
suddenly
reminded
of
sammy
appearance
by
the
headmaster
words
broke
into
a
wild
screech
of
laughter
and
was
instantly
awarded
two
hundred
lines
the
school
filed
out
of
the
hall
to
their
various
lunches
and
mr
downing
was
left
with
the
conviction
that
if
he
wanted
the
criminal
discovered
he
would
have
to
discover
him
for
himself
the
great
thing
in
affairs
of
this
kind
is
to
get
a
good
start
and
fate
feeling
perhaps
that
it
had
been
a
little
hard
upon
mr
downing
gave
him
a
most
magnificent
start
instead
of
having
to
hunt
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
he
found
himself
in
a
moment
in
the
position
of
being
set
to
find
it
in
a
mere
truss
of
straw
it
was
outwood
who
helped
him
sergeant
collard
had
waylaid
the
archaeological
expert
on
his
way
to
chapel
and
informed
him
that
at
close
on
twelve
the
night
before
he
had
observed
a
youth
unidentified
attempting
to
get
into
his
house
the
water
pipe
outwood
whose
thoughts
were
occupied
with
apses
and
plinths
not
to
mention
cromlechs
at
the
time
thanked
the
sergeant
with
absent
minded
politeness
and
passed
on
later
he
remembered
the
fact
apropos
of
some
reflections
on
the
subject
of
burglars
in
medieval
england
and
passed
it
on
to
mr
downing
as
they
walked
back
to
lunch
then
the
boy
was
in
your
house
exclaimed
mr
downing
not
actually
in
as
far
as
i
understand
i
gather
from
the
sergeant
that
he
interrupted
him
before
i
mean
he
must
have
been
one
of
the
boys
in
your
house
but
what
was
he
doing
out
at
that
hour
he
had
broken
out
impossible
i
think
oh
yes
quite
impossible
i
went
around
the
dormitories
as
usual
at
eleven
last
night
and
all
the
boys
were
asleep
all
of
them
mr
downing
was
not
listening
he
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
and
exultation
which
made
it
hard
for
him
to
attend
to
his
colleague
slow
utterances
he
had
a
clue
now
that
the
search
had
narrowed
itself
down
to
outwood
house
the
rest
was
comparatively
easy
perhaps
sergeant
collard
had
actually
recognized
the
boy
on
reflection
he
dismissed
this
as
unlikely
for
the
sergeant
would
scarcely
have
kept
a
thing
like
that
to
himself
but
he
might
very
well
have
seen
more
of
him
than
he
downing
had
seen
it
was
only
with
an
effort
that
he
could
keep
himself
from
rushing
to
the
sergeant
then
and
there
and
leaving
the
house
lunch
to
look
after
itself
he
resolved
to
go
the
moment
that
meal
was
at
an
end
sunday
lunch
at
a
house
is
probably
one
of
the
longest
functions
in
existence
it
drags
its
slow
length
along
like
a
languid
snake
but
it
finishes
in
time
in
due
course
mr
downing
after
sitting
still
and
eyeing
with
acute
dislike
everybody
who
asked
for
a
second
helping
found
himself
at
liberty
regardless
of
the
claims
of
digestion
he
rushed
forth
on
the
trail
sergeant
collard
lived
with
his
wife
and
a
family
of
unknown
dimensions
in
the
lodge
at
the
school
front
gate
dinner
was
just
over
when
mr
downing
arrived
as
a
blind
man
could
have
told
the
sergeant
received
his
visitor
with
dignity
ejecting
the
family
who
were
torpid
after
roast
beef
and
resented
having
to
move
in
order
to
ensure
privacy
having
requested
his
host
to
smoke
which
the
latter
was
about
to
do
unasked
mr
downing
stated
his
case
outwood
he
said
tells
me
that
last
night
sergeant
you
saw
a
boy
endeavoring
to
enter
his
house
the
sergeant
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
yer
he
said
i
did
sir
spotted
i
did
feeflee
good
at
spottin
i
am
sir
dook
of
connaught
he
used
to
say

collard
used
to
say

but

off
in
a
flash
and
i
doubles
after
prompt
but
you
did
catch
him
no
sir
admitted
the
sergeant
reluctantly
did
you
catch
sight
of
his
face
sergeant
no
sir
was
doublin
away
in
the
opposite
direction
did
you
notice
anything
at
all
about
his
appearance
was
a
long
young
chap
sir
with
a
pair
of
legs
on
him
feeflee
fast
run
sir
feeflee
you
noticed
nothing
else
was
wearing
no
cap
of
any
sort
sir
ah
sir
added
the
sergeant
rubbing
the
point
in
it
was
undoubtedly
the
same
boy
undoubtedly
i
wish
you
could
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
face
sergeant
so
do
i
sir
you
would
not
be
able
to
recognize
him
again
if
you
saw
him
you
think
would
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
sir
yer
see
feeflee
good
at
spottin
but
it
was
a
dark
night
mr
downing
rose
to
go
well
he
said
the
search
is
now
considerably
narrowed
down
considerably
it
is
certain
that
the
boy
was
one
of
the
boys
in
outwood
house
young
monkeys
interjected
the
sergeant
helpfully
good
afternoon
sergeant
good
afternoon
to
you
sir
pray
do
not
move
sergeant
the
sergeant
had
not
shown
the
slightest
inclination
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
i
will
find
my
way
out
very
hot
today
is
it
not
feeflee
warm
sir
weather
goin
to
break
workin
up
for
thunder
i
hope
not
the
school
plays
the
on
wednesday
and
it
would
be
a
pity
if
rain
were
to
spoil
our
first
fixture
with
them
good
afternoon
and
mr
downing
went
out
into
the
baking
sunlight
while
sergeant
collard
having
requested
collard
to
take
the
children
out
for
a
walk
at
once
and
furthermore
to
give
young
ernie
a
clip
side
of
the
if
he
persisted
in
making
so
much
noise
put
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
rested
his
feet
on
the
table
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
the
for
the
doctor
watsons
of
this
world
as
opposed
to
the
sherlock
holmeses
success
in
the
province
of
detective
work
must
be
to
a
very
large
extent
the
result
of
luck
sherlock
holmes
can
extract
a
clue
from
a
wisp
of
straw
or
a
flake
of
cigar
ash
but
doctor
watson
has
got
to
have
it
taken
out
for
him
and
dusted
and
exhibited
clearly
with
a
label
attached
the
average
man
is
a
doctor
watson
we
are
wont
to
scoff
in
a
patronizing
manner
at
that
humbler
follower
of
the
great
investigator
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
should
have
been
just
as
dull
ourselves
we
should
not
even
have
risen
to
the
modest
level
of
a
scotland
yard
bungler
we
should
simply
have
hung
around
saying
my
dear
holmes
how
and
all
the
rest
of
it
just
as
the
downtrodden
medico
did
it
is
not
often
that
the
ordinary
person
has
any
need
to
see
what
he
can
do
in
the
way
of
detection
he
gets
along
very
comfortably
in
the
humdrum
round
of
life
without
having
to
measure
footprints
and
smile
quiet
smiles
but
if
ever
the
emergency
does
arise
he
thinks
naturally
of
sherlock
holmes
and
his
methods
mr
downing
had
read
all
the
holmes
stories
with
great
attention
and
had
thought
many
times
what
an
incompetent
ass
doctor
watson
was
but
now
that
he
had
started
to
handle
his
own
first
case
he
was
compelled
to
admit
that
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in
extenuation
of
watson
inability
to
unravel
tangles
it
certainly
was
uncommonly
hard
he
thought
as
he
paced
the
cricket
field
after
leaving
sergeant
collard
to
detect
anybody
unless
you
knew
who
had
really
done
the
crime
as
he
brooded
over
the
case
in
hand
his
sympathy
for
doctor
watson
increased
with
every
minute
and
he
began
to
feel
a
certain
resentment
against
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
it
was
all
very
well
for
sir
arthur
to
be
so
shrewd
and
infallible
about
tracing
a
mystery
to
its
source
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
who
had
done
the
thing
before
he
started
now
that
he
began
really
to
look
into
this
matter
of
the
alarm
bell
and
the
painting
of
sammy
the
conviction
was
creeping
over
him
that
the
problem
was
more
difficult
than
a
casual
observer
might
imagine
he
had
got
as
far
as
finding
that
his
quarry
of
the
previous
night
was
a
boy
in
outwood
house
but
how
was
he
to
get
any
further
that
was
the
thing
there
was
of
course
only
a
limited
number
of
boys
in
outwood
house
as
tall
as
the
one
he
had
pursued
but
even
if
there
had
been
only
one
other
it
would
have
complicated
matters
if
you
go
to
a
boy
and
say
either
you
or
jones
were
out
of
your
house
last
night
at
twelve
the
boy
does
not
reply
sir
i
can
not
tell
a
lie
i
was
out
of
my
house
last
night
at
twelve
he
simply
assumes
the
animated
expression
of
a
stuffed
fish
and
leaves
the
next
move
to
you
it
is
practically
stalemate
all
these
things
passed
through
mr
downing
mind
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
cricket
field
that
afternoon
what
he
wanted
was
a
clue
but
it
is
so
hard
for
the
novice
to
tell
what
is
a
clue
and
what
is
probably
if
he
only
knew
there
were
clues
lying
all
over
the
place
shouting
to
him
to
pick
them
up
what
with
the
oppressive
heat
of
the
day
and
the
fatigue
of
hard
thinking
mr
downing
was
working
up
for
a
brainstorm
when
fate
once
more
intervened
this
time
in
the
shape
of
riglett
a
junior
member
of
his
house
riglett
slunk
up
in
the
shamefaced
way
peculiar
to
some
boys
even
when
they
have
done
nothing
wrong
and
having
capped
mr
downing
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
doing
something
particularly
shady
requested
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
fetch
his
bicycle
from
the
shed
your
bicycle
snapped
mr
downing
much
thinking
had
made
him
irritable
what
do
you
want
with
your
bicycle
riglett
shuffled
stood
first
on
his
left
foot
then
on
his
right
blushed
and
finally
remarked
as
if
it
were
not
so
much
a
sound
reason
as
a
sort
of
feeble
excuse
for
the
low
and
blackguardly
fact
that
he
wanted
his
bicycle
that
he
had
got
leave
for
tea
that
afternoon
then
mr
downing
remembered
riglett
had
an
aunt
resident
about
three
miles
from
the
school
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
visit
occasionally
on
sunday
afternoons
during
the
term
he
felt
for
his
bunch
of
keys
and
made
his
way
to
the
shed
riglett
shambling
behind
at
an
interval
of
two
yards
mr
downing
unlocked
the
door
and
there
on
the
floor
was
the
clue
a
clue
that
even
doctor
watson
could
not
have
overlooked
mr
downing
saw
it
but
did
not
immediately
recognize
it
for
what
it
was
what
he
saw
at
first
was
not
a
clue
but
just
a
mess
he
had
a
tidy
soul
and
abhorred
messes
and
this
was
a
particularly
messy
mess
the
greater
part
of
the
flooring
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
door
was
a
sea
of
red
paint
the
tin
from
which
it
had
flowed
was
lying
on
its
side
in
the
middle
of
the
shed
the
air
was
full
of
the
pungent
scent
pah
said
mr
downing
then
suddenly
beneath
the
disguise
of
the
mess
he
saw
the
clue
a
footmark
no
less
a
crimson
footmark
on
the
gray
concrete
riglett
who
had
been
waiting
patiently
two
yards
away
now
coughed
plaintively
the
sound
recalled
mr
downing
to
mundane
matters
get
your
bicycle
riglett
he
said
and
be
careful
where
you
tread
somebody
has
upset
a
pot
of
paint
on
the
floor
riglett
walking
delicately
through
dry
places
extracted
his
bicycle
from
the
rack
and
presently
departed
to
gladden
the
heart
of
his
aunt
leaving
mr
downing
his
brain
fizzing
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
detective
to
lock
the
door
and
resume
his
perambulation
of
the
cricket
field
give
doctor
watson
a
fair
start
and
he
is
a
demon
at
the
game
mr
downing
brain
was
now
working
with
a
rapidity
and
clearness
which
a
professional
sleuth
might
have
envied
paint
red
paint
obviously
the
same
paint
with
which
sammy
had
been
decorated
a
footmark
whose
footmark
plainly
that
of
the
criminal
who
had
done
the
deed
of
decoration
yoicks
there
were
two
things
however
to
be
considered
your
careful
detective
must
consider
everything
in
the
first
place
the
paint
might
have
been
upset
by
the
groundsman
it
was
the
groundsman
paint
he
had
been
giving
a
fresh
coating
to
the
woodwork
in
front
of
the
pavilion
scoring
box
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday
match
a
labor
of
love
which
was
the
direct
outcome
of
the
enthusiasm
for
work
which
adair
had
instilled
into
him
in
that
case
the
footmark
might
be
his
interview
the
groundsman
on
this
point
in
the
second
place
adair
might
have
upset
the
tin
and
trodden
in
its
contents
when
he
went
to
get
his
bicycle
in
order
to
fetch
the
doctor
for
the
suffering
macphee
this
was
the
more
probable
of
the
two
contingencies
for
it
would
have
been
dark
in
the
shed
when
adair
went
into
it
interview
adair
as
to
whether
he
found
on
returning
to
the
house
that
there
was
paint
on
his
shoes
things
were
moving
he
resolved
to
take
adair
first
he
could
get
the
groundsman
address
from
him
passing
by
the
trees
under
whose
shade
mike
and
psmith
and
dunster
had
watched
the
match
on
the
previous
day
he
came
upon
the
head
of
his
house
in
a
deck
chair
reading
a
book
a
summer
sunday
afternoon
is
the
time
for
reading
in
deck
chairs
oh
adair
he
said
no
do
get
up
i
merely
wished
to
ask
you
if
you
found
any
paint
on
your
shoes
when
you
returned
to
the
house
last
night
paint
sir
adair
was
plainly
puzzled
his
book
had
been
interesting
and
had
driven
the
sammy
incident
out
of
his
head
i
see
somebody
has
spilled
some
paint
on
the
floor
of
the
bicycle
shed
you
did
not
do
that
i
suppose
when
you
went
to
fetch
your
bicycle
no
sir
it
is
spilled
all
over
the
floor
i
wondered
whether
you
had
happened
to
tread
in
it
but
you
say
you
found
no
paint
on
your
shoes
this
morning
no
sir
my
bicycle
is
always
quite
near
the
door
of
the
shed
i
go
into
the
shed
at
all
i
see
quite
so
thank
you
adair
oh
by
the
way
adair
where
does
markby
live
i
forget
the
name
of
his
cottage
sir
but
i
could
show
you
in
a
second
it
one
of
those
cottages
just
past
the
school
gates
on
the
right
as
you
turn
out
into
the
road
there
are
three
in
a
row
his
is
the
first
you
come
to
there
a
barn
just
before
you
get
to
them
thank
you
i
shall
be
able
to
find
them
i
should
like
to
speak
to
markby
for
a
moment
on
a
small
matter
a
sharp
walk
took
him
to
the
cottages
adair
had
mentioned
he
rapped
at
the
door
of
the
first
and
the
groundsman
came
out
in
his
shirt
sleeves
blinking
as
if
he
had
just
waked
up
as
was
indeed
the
case
oh
markby
sir
you
remember
that
you
were
painting
the
scoring
box
in
the
pavilion
last
night
after
the
match
yes
sir
it
wanted
a
lick
of
paint
bad
the
young
gentlemen
will
scramble
about
and
get
through
the
window
makes
it
look
shabby
sir
so
i
thought
i
better
give
it
a
coating
so
as
to
look
shipshape
when
the
marylebone
come
down
just
so
an
excellent
idea
tell
me
markby
what
did
you
do
with
the
pot
of
paint
when
you
had
finished
put
it
in
the
bicycle
shed
sir
on
the
floor
on
the
floor
sir
no
on
the
shelf
at
the
far
end
with
the
can
of
whitening
what
i
use
for
marking
out
the
wickets
sir
of
course
yes
quite
so
just
as
i
thought
do
you
want
it
sir
no
thank
you
markby
no
thank
you
the
fact
is
somebody
who
had
no
business
to
do
so
has
moved
the
pot
of
paint
from
the
shelf
to
the
floor
with
the
result
that
it
has
been
kicked
over
and
spilled
you
had
better
get
some
more
tomorrow
thank
you
markby
that
is
all
i
wished
to
know
mr
downing
walked
back
to
the
school
thoroughly
excited
he
was
hot
on
the
scent
now
the
only
other
possible
theories
had
been
tested
and
successfully
exploded
the
thing
had
become
simple
to
a
degree
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
go
to
outwood
house
the
idea
of
searching
a
fellow
master
house
did
not
appear
to
him
at
all
a
delicate
task
somehow
one
grew
unconsciously
to
feel
that
outwood
did
not
really
exist
as
a
man
capable
of
resenting
liberties
find
the
shoe
ascertain
its
owner
and
denounce
him
to
the
headmaster
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
a
shoe
must
be
in
house
somewhere
a
boy
can
not
tread
in
a
pool
of
paint
without
showing
some
signs
of
having
done
so
it
was
sunday
too
so
that
the
shoe
would
not
yet
have
been
cleaned
yoicks
also
this
really
was
beginning
to
be
something
like
business
regardless
of
the
heat
the
hurried
across
to
outwood
as
fast
as
he
could
walk
a
check
the
only
two
members
of
the
house
not
out
in
the
grounds
when
he
arrived
were
mike
and
psmith
they
were
standing
on
the
gravel
drive
in
front
of
the
boys
entrance
mike
had
a
deck
chair
in
one
hand
and
a
book
in
the
other
psmith
for
even
the
greatest
minds
will
sometimes
unbend
was
wrestling
with
a
that
is
to
say
he
was
trying
without
success
to
keep
the
spool
spinning
he
smoothed
a
crease
out
of
his
waistcoat
and
tried
again
he
had
just
succeeded
in
getting
the
thing
to
spin
when
mr
downing
arrived
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
disturbed
psmith
and
brought
the
effort
to
nothing
enough
of
this
spoolery
said
he
flinging
the
spool
through
the
open
window
of
the
senior
day
room
i
was
an
ass
ever
to
try
it
the
philosophical
mind
needs
complete
repose
in
its
hours
of
leisure
hello
he
stared
after
the
who
had
just
entered
the
house
what
the
dickens
said
mike
does
he
mean
by
barging
in
as
if
bought
the
place
comrade
downing
looks
pleased
with
himself
what
brings
him
around
in
this
direction
i
wonder
still
no
matter
the
few
articles
which
he
may
sneak
from
our
study
are
of
inconsiderable
value
he
is
welcome
to
them
do
you
feel
inclined
to
wait
awhile
till
i
have
fetched
a
chair
and
book
i
be
going
on
i
shall
be
under
the
trees
at
the
far
end
of
the
ground
is
well
i
will
be
with
you
in
about
two
ticks
mike
walked
on
toward
the
field
and
psmith
strolling
upstairs
to
fetch
his
novel
found
mr
downing
standing
in
the
passage
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
lost
his
bearings
a
warm
afternoon
sir
murmured
psmith
courteously
as
he
passed
er
smith
sir
i
er
wish
to
go
round
the
dormitories
it
was
psmith
guiding
rule
in
life
never
to
be
surprised
at
anything
so
he
merely
inclined
his
head
gracefully
and
said
nothing
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
fetch
the
keys
and
show
me
where
the
rooms
are
with
acute
pleasure
sir
said
psmith
or
shall
i
fetch
outwood
sir
do
as
i
tell
you
smith
snapped
mr
downing
psmith
said
no
more
but
went
down
to
the
matron
room
the
matron
being
out
he
abstracted
the
bunch
of
keys
from
her
table
and
rejoined
the
master
shall
i
lead
the
way
sir
he
asked
mr
downing
nodded
here
sir
said
psmith
opening
the
door
we
have
barnes
dormitory
an
airy
room
constructed
on
the
soundest
hygienic
principles
each
boy
i
understand
has
quite
a
considerable
number
of
cubic
feet
of
air
all
to
himself
it
is
outwood
boast
that
no
boy
has
ever
asked
for
a
cubic
foot
of
air
in
vain
he
argues
justly
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
began
to
watch
the
other
maneuvers
in
silence
mr
downing
was
peering
rapidly
beneath
each
bed
in
turn
are
you
looking
for
barnes
sir
inquired
psmith
politely
i
think
he
out
in
the
field
mr
downing
rose
having
examined
the
last
bed
crimson
in
the
face
with
the
exercise
show
me
the
next
dormitory
smith
he
said
panting
slightly
this
said
psmith
opening
the
next
door
and
sinking
his
voice
to
an
awed
whisper
is
where
sleep
mr
downing
glanced
swiftly
beneath
the
three
beds
excuse
me
sir
said
psmith
but
are
we
chasing
anything
be
good
enough
smith
said
mr
downing
with
asperity
to
keep
your
remarks
to
yourself
i
was
only
wondering
sir
shall
i
show
you
the
next
in
order
certainly
they
moved
on
up
the
passage
drawing
blank
at
the
last
dormitory
mr
downing
paused
baffled
psmith
waited
patiently
by
an
idea
struck
the
master
the
studies
smith
he
cried
aha
said
psmith
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
the
observation
escaped
me
unawares
the
frenzy
of
the
chase
is
beginning
to
enter
into
my
blood
here
we
have
mr
downing
stopped
short
is
this
impertinence
studied
smith
ferguson
study
sir
no
sir
that
farther
down
the
passage
this
is
barnes
mr
downing
looked
at
him
closely
psmith
face
was
wooden
in
its
gravity
the
master
snorted
suspiciously
then
moved
on
whose
is
this
he
asked
rapping
a
door
this
sir
is
mine
and
jackson
what
have
you
a
study
you
are
low
down
in
the
school
for
it
i
think
sir
that
outwood
gave
it
us
rather
as
a
testimonial
to
our
general
worth
than
to
our
proficiency
in
schoolwork
mr
downing
raked
the
room
with
a
keen
eye
the
absence
of
bars
from
the
window
attracted
his
attention
have
you
no
bars
to
your
windows
here
such
as
there
are
in
my
house
there
appears
to
be
no
bar
sir
said
psmith
putting
up
his
eyeglass
mr
downing
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
a
lovely
view
is
it
not
sir
said
psmith
the
trees
the
field
the
distant
hills
mr
downing
suddenly
started
his
eye
had
been
caught
by
the
water
pipe
at
the
side
of
the
window
the
boy
whom
sergeant
collard
had
seen
climbing
the
pipe
must
have
been
making
for
this
study
he
spun
around
and
met
psmith
blandly
inquiring
gaze
he
looked
at
psmith
carefully
for
a
moment
no
the
boy
he
had
chased
last
night
had
not
been
psmith
that
exquisite
figure
and
general
appearance
were
unmistakable
even
in
the
dusk
whom
did
you
say
you
shared
this
study
with
smith
jackson
sir
the
cricketer
never
mind
about
his
cricket
smith
said
mr
downing
with
irritation
no
sir
he
is
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
room
yes
sir
nobody
else
comes
into
it
if
they
do
they
go
out
extremely
quickly
sir
ah
thank
you
smith
not
at
all
sir
mr
downing
pondered
jackson
the
boy
bore
him
a
grudge
the
boy
was
precisely
the
sort
of
boy
to
revenge
himself
by
painting
the
dog
sammy
and
gadzooks
the
boy
whom
he
had
pursued
last
night
had
been
just
about
jackson
size
and
build
mr
downing
was
as
firmly
convinced
at
that
moment
that
mike
had
been
the
hand
to
wield
the
paintbrush
as
he
had
ever
been
of
anything
in
his
life
smith
he
said
excitedly
on
the
spot
sir
said
psmith
affably
where
are
jackson
shoes
there
are
moments
when
the
giddy
excitement
of
being
right
on
the
trail
causes
the
amateur
or
watsonian
detective
to
be
incautious
such
a
moment
came
to
mr
downing
then
if
he
had
been
wise
he
would
have
achieved
his
object
the
getting
a
glimpse
of
mike
shoes
by
a
devious
and
snaky
route
as
it
was
he
rushed
straight
on
his
shoes
sir
he
has
them
on
i
noticed
them
as
he
went
out
just
now
where
is
the
pair
he
wore
yesterday
where
are
the
shoes
of
yesteryear
murmured
psmith
to
himself
i
should
say
at
a
venture
sir
that
they
would
be
in
the
basket
downstairs
edmund
our
genial
boy
collects
them
i
believe
at
early
dawn
would
they
have
been
cleaned
yet
if
i
know
edmund
sir
no
smith
said
mr
downing
trembling
with
excitement
go
and
bring
that
basket
to
me
here
psmith
brain
was
working
rapidly
as
he
went
downstairs
what
exactly
was
at
the
back
of
the
sleuth
mind
prompting
these
maneuvers
he
did
not
know
but
that
there
was
something
and
that
that
something
was
directed
in
a
hostile
manner
against
mike
probably
in
connection
with
last
night
wild
happenings
he
was
certain
psmith
had
noticed
on
leaving
his
bed
at
the
sound
of
the
alarm
bell
that
he
and
jellicoe
were
alone
in
the
room
that
might
mean
that
mike
had
gone
out
through
the
door
when
the
bell
sounded
or
it
might
mean
that
he
had
been
out
all
the
time
it
began
to
look
as
if
the
latter
solution
were
the
correct
one
he
staggered
back
with
the
basket
painfully
conscious
all
the
while
that
it
was
creasing
his
waistcoat
and
dumped
it
down
on
the
study
floor
mr
downing
stooped
eagerly
over
it
psmith
leaned
against
the
wall
and
straightened
out
the
damaged
garment
we
have
here
sir
he
said
a
fair
selection
of
our
various
bootings
mr
downing
looked
up
you
dropped
none
of
the
shoes
on
your
way
up
smith
not
one
sir
it
was
a
fine
performance
mr
downing
uttered
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
bent
once
more
to
his
task
shoes
flew
about
the
room
mr
downing
knelt
on
the
floor
beside
the
basket
and
dug
like
a
terrier
at
a
rathole
at
last
he
made
a
dive
and
with
an
exclamation
of
triumph
rose
to
his
feet
in
his
hand
he
held
a
shoe
put
those
back
again
smith
he
said
the
wearing
an
expression
such
as
a
martyr
might
have
worn
on
being
told
off
for
the
stake
began
to
pick
up
the
scattered
footgear
whistling
softly
the
tune
of
i
do
all
the
dirty
work
as
he
did
so
that
the
lot
sir
he
said
rising
ah
now
come
across
with
me
to
the
headmaster
house
leave
the
basket
here
you
can
carry
it
back
when
you
return
shall
i
put
back
that
shoe
sir
certainly
not
i
shall
take
this
with
me
of
course
shall
i
carry
it
sir
mr
downing
reflected
yes
smith
he
said
i
think
it
would
be
best
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
spectacle
of
a
house
master
wandering
abroad
on
the
public
highway
carrying
a
dirty
shoe
might
be
a
trifle
undignified
you
never
knew
whom
you
might
meet
on
sunday
afternoon
psmith
took
the
shoe
and
doing
so
understood
what
before
had
puzzled
him
across
the
toe
of
the
shoe
was
a
broad
splash
of
red
paint
he
knew
nothing
of
course
of
the
upset
tin
in
the
bicycle
shed
but
when
a
housemaster
dog
has
been
painted
red
in
the
night
and
when
on
the
following
day
the
housemaster
goes
about
in
search
of
a
paint
splashed
shoe
one
puts
two
and
two
together
psmith
looked
at
the
name
inside
the
shoe
it
was
brown
bootmaker
bridgnorth
bridgnorth
was
only
a
few
miles
from
his
own
home
and
mike
undoubtedly
it
was
mike
shoe
can
you
tell
me
whose
shoe
that
is
asked
mr
downing
psmith
looked
at
it
again
no
sir
i
ca
say
the
little
chap
familiar
to
me
come
with
me
then
mr
downing
left
the
room
after
a
moment
psmith
followed
him
the
headmaster
was
in
his
garden
thither
mr
downing
made
his
way
the
psmith
in
close
attendance
the
head
listened
to
the
amateur
detective
statement
with
interest
indeed
he
said
when
mr
downing
had
finished
indeed
dear
me
it
certainly
seems
it
is
a
curiously
thread
of
evidence
you
are
certain
that
there
was
red
paint
on
this
shoe
you
discovered
in
outwood
house
i
have
it
with
me
i
brought
it
on
purpose
to
show
to
you
smith
sir
you
have
the
shoe
ah
said
the
headmaster
putting
on
a
pair
of
now
let
me
look
at
this
you
say
is
the
just
so
just
so
just
but
er
mr
downing
it
may
be
that
i
have
not
examined
this
shoe
with
sufficient
care
but
can
point
out
to
me
exactly
where
this
paint
is
that
you
speak
of
mr
downing
stood
staring
at
the
shoe
with
a
wild
fixed
stare
of
any
suspicion
of
paint
red
or
otherwise
it
was
absolutely
and
entirely
innocent
the
destroyer
of
evidence
the
shoe
became
the
center
of
attention
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
mr
downing
fixed
it
with
the
piercing
stare
of
one
who
feels
that
his
brain
is
tottering
the
headmaster
looked
at
it
with
a
mildly
puzzled
expression
psmith
putting
up
his
eyeglass
gazed
at
it
with
a
sort
of
affectionate
interest
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
it
to
do
a
trick
of
some
kind
mr
downing
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
there
was
paint
on
this
shoe
he
said
vehemently
i
tell
you
there
was
a
splash
of
red
paint
across
the
toe
smith
will
bear
me
out
in
this
smith
you
saw
the
paint
on
this
shoe
paint
sir
what
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
did
see
it
no
sir
there
was
no
paint
on
this
shoe
this
is
foolery
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
it
was
a
broad
splash
right
across
the
toe
the
headmaster
interposed
you
must
have
made
a
mistake
mr
downing
there
is
certainly
no
trace
of
paint
on
this
shoe
these
momentary
optical
delusions
are
i
fancy
not
uncommon
any
doctor
will
tell
you
i
had
an
aunt
sir
said
psmith
chattily
who
was
remarkably
subject
it
is
absurd
i
can
not
have
been
mistaken
said
mr
downing
i
am
positively
certain
the
toe
of
this
shoe
was
red
when
i
found
it
it
is
undoubtedly
black
now
mr
downing
a
sort
of
chameleon
shoe
murmured
psmith
the
goaded
housemaster
turned
on
him
what
did
you
say
smith
did
i
speak
sir
said
psmith
with
the
start
of
one
coming
suddenly
out
of
a
trance
mr
downing
looked
searchingly
at
him
you
had
better
be
careful
smith
yes
sir
i
strongly
suspect
you
of
having
something
to
do
with
this
really
mr
downing
said
the
headmaster
this
is
surely
improbable
smith
could
scarcely
have
cleaned
the
shoe
on
his
way
to
my
house
on
one
occasion
i
inadvertently
spilled
some
paint
on
a
shoe
of
my
own
i
can
assure
you
that
it
does
not
brush
off
it
needs
a
very
systematic
cleaning
before
all
traces
are
removed
exactly
sir
said
psmith
my
theory
if
i
may
certainly
smith
psmith
bowed
courteously
and
proceeded
my
theory
sir
is
that
mr
downing
was
deceived
by
the
effects
on
the
toe
of
the
shoe
the
afternoon
sun
streaming
in
through
the
window
must
have
shone
on
the
shoe
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
it
a
momentary
and
fictitious
aspect
of
redness
if
mr
downing
recollects
he
did
not
look
long
at
the
shoe
the
picture
on
the
retina
of
the
eye
consequently
had
not
time
to
fade
i
remember
thinking
myself
at
the
moment
that
the
shoe
appeared
to
have
a
certain
reddish
tint
the
mistake
bag
said
mr
downing
shortly
well
really
said
the
headmaster
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
only
explanation
that
will
square
with
the
facts
a
shoe
that
is
really
smeared
with
red
paint
does
not
become
black
of
itself
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
you
are
very
right
sir
said
psmith
with
benevolent
approval
may
i
go
now
sir
i
am
in
the
middle
of
a
singularly
impressive
passage
of
cicero
speech
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
leave
your
preparation
till
sunday
smith
it
is
a
habit
of
which
i
altogether
disapprove
i
am
reading
it
sir
said
psmith
with
simple
dignity
for
pleasure
shall
i
take
the
shoe
with
me
sir
if
mr
downing
does
not
want
it
the
housemaster
passed
the
fraudulent
piece
of
evidence
to
psmith
without
a
word
and
the
latter
having
included
both
masters
in
a
kindly
smile
left
the
garden
pedestrians
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
passing
along
the
road
between
the
headmaster
house
and
outwood
at
that
moment
saw
what
if
they
had
but
known
it
was
a
most
unusual
sight
the
spectacle
of
psmith
running
psmith
usual
mode
of
progression
was
a
dignified
walk
he
believed
in
the
contemplative
style
rather
than
the
hustling
on
this
occasion
however
reckless
of
possible
injuries
to
the
crease
of
his
trousers
he
raced
down
the
road
and
turning
in
at
gate
bounded
upstairs
like
a
highly
trained
professional
athlete
on
arriving
at
the
study
his
first
act
was
to
remove
a
shoe
from
the
top
of
the
pile
in
the
basket
place
it
in
the
small
cupboard
under
the
bookshelf
and
lock
the
cupboard
then
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
panted
brain
he
said
to
himself
approvingly
is
what
one
chiefly
needs
in
matters
of
this
kind
without
brain
where
are
we
in
the
soup
every
time
the
next
development
will
be
when
comrade
downing
thinks
it
over
and
is
struck
with
the
brilliant
idea
that
it
just
possible
that
the
shoe
he
gave
me
to
carry
and
the
shoe
i
did
carry
were
not
one
shoe
but
two
shoes
meanwhile
he
dragged
up
another
chair
for
his
feet
and
picked
up
his
novel
he
had
not
been
reading
long
when
there
was
a
footstep
in
the
passage
and
mr
downing
appeared
the
possibility
in
fact
the
probability
of
psmith
having
substituted
another
shoe
for
the
one
with
the
incriminating
splash
of
paint
on
it
had
occurred
to
him
almost
immediately
on
leaving
the
garden
psmith
and
mike
he
reflected
were
friends
psmith
impulse
would
be
to
do
all
that
lay
in
his
power
to
shield
mike
feeling
aggrieved
with
himself
that
he
had
not
thought
of
this
before
he
too
hurried
over
to
outwood
mr
downing
was
brisk
and
peremptory
i
wish
to
look
at
these
shoes
again
he
said
psmith
with
a
sigh
laid
down
his
novel
and
rose
to
assist
him
sit
down
smith
said
the
housemaster
i
can
manage
without
your
help
psmith
sat
down
again
carefully
tucking
up
the
knees
of
his
trousers
and
watched
him
with
silent
interest
through
his
eyeglass
the
scrutiny
irritated
mr
downing
put
that
thing
away
smith
he
said
that
thing
sir
yes
that
ridiculous
glass
put
it
away
why
sir
why
because
i
tell
you
to
do
so
i
guessed
that
that
was
the
reason
sir
sighed
psmith
replacing
the
eyeglass
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
resumed
his
contemplative
inspection
of
the
shoe
expert
who
after
fidgeting
for
a
few
moments
lodged
another
complaint
do
sit
there
staring
at
me
smith
i
was
interested
in
what
you
were
doing
sir
never
mind
do
stare
at
me
in
that
idiotic
way
may
i
read
sir
asked
psmith
patiently
yes
read
if
you
like
thank
you
sir
psmith
took
up
his
book
again
and
mr
downing
now
thoroughly
irritated
pursued
his
investigations
in
the
boot
basket
he
went
through
it
twice
but
each
time
without
success
after
the
second
search
he
stood
up
and
looked
wildly
round
the
room
he
was
as
certain
as
he
could
be
of
anything
that
the
missing
piece
of
evidence
was
somewhere
in
the
study
it
was
no
use
asking
psmith
where
it
was
for
psmith
ability
to
parry
dangerous
questions
with
evasive
answers
was
quite
out
of
the
common
his
eye
roamed
about
the
room
there
was
very
little
cover
there
even
for
so
small
a
fugitive
as
a
number
nine
shoe
the
floor
could
be
acquitted
on
sight
of
harboring
the
quarry
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
cupboard
and
something
seemed
to
tell
him
that
there
was
the
place
to
look
smith
he
said
psmith
had
been
reading
placidly
all
the
while
yes
sir
what
is
in
this
cupboard
that
cupboard
sir
yes
this
cupboard
mr
downing
rapped
the
door
irritably
just
a
few
odd
trifles
sir
we
do
not
often
use
it
a
ball
of
string
perhaps
possibly
an
old
notebook
nothing
of
value
or
interest
open
it
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
is
locked
sir
unlock
it
but
where
is
the
key
sir
have
you
not
got
the
key
if
the
key
is
not
in
the
lock
sir
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
it
will
take
a
long
search
to
find
it
where
did
you
see
it
last
it
was
in
the
lock
yesterday
morning
jackson
might
have
taken
it
where
is
jackson
out
in
the
field
somewhere
sir
mr
downing
thought
for
a
moment
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
he
said
shortly
i
have
my
reasons
for
thinking
that
you
are
deliberately
keeping
the
contents
of
that
cupboard
from
me
i
shall
break
open
the
door
psmith
got
up
i
afraid
you
must
do
that
sir
mr
downing
stared
amazed
are
you
aware
whom
you
are
talking
to
smith
he
inquired
icily
yes
sir
and
i
know
it
not
outwood
to
whom
that
cupboard
happens
to
belong
if
you
wish
to
break
it
open
you
must
get
his
permission
he
is
the
sole
lessee
and
proprietor
of
that
cupboard
i
am
only
the
acting
manager
mr
downing
paused
he
also
reflected
outwood
in
the
general
rule
did
not
count
much
in
the
scheme
of
things
but
possibly
there
were
limits
to
the
treating
of
him
as
if
he
did
not
exist
to
enter
his
house
without
his
permission
and
search
it
to
a
certain
extent
was
all
very
well
but
when
it
came
to
breaking
up
his
furniture
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
maddening
thought
that
if
he
left
the
study
in
search
of
outwood
in
order
to
obtain
his
sanction
for
the
work
which
he
proposed
to
carry
through
smith
would
be
alone
in
the
room
and
he
knew
that
if
smith
were
left
alone
in
the
room
he
would
instantly
remove
the
shoe
to
some
other
hiding
place
he
thoroughly
disbelieved
the
story
of
the
lost
key
he
was
perfectly
convinced
that
the
missing
shoe
was
in
the
cupboard
he
stood
chewing
these
thoughts
for
a
while
psmith
in
the
meantime
standing
in
a
graceful
attitude
in
front
of
the
cupboard
staring
into
vacancy
then
he
was
seized
with
a
happy
idea
why
should
he
leave
the
room
at
all
if
he
sent
smith
then
he
himself
could
wait
and
make
certain
that
the
cupboard
was
not
tampered
with
smith
he
said
go
and
find
outwood
and
ask
him
to
be
good
enough
to
come
here
for
a
moment
mainly
about
shoes
be
quick
smith
he
said
as
the
latter
stood
looking
at
him
without
making
any
movement
in
the
direction
of
the
door
sir
said
psmith
meditatively
as
if
he
had
been
asked
a
conundrum
go
and
find
outwood
at
once
psmith
still
made
no
move
do
you
intend
to
disobey
me
smith
mr
downing
voice
was
steely
yes
sir
what
yes
sir
there
was
one
of
those
silences
psmith
was
staring
reflectively
at
the
ceiling
mr
downing
was
looking
as
if
at
any
moment
he
might
say
thwarted
to
me
face
ha
ha
and
by
a
very
stripling
it
was
psmith
however
who
resumed
the
conversation
his
manner
was
almost
too
respectful
which
made
it
all
the
more
a
pity
that
what
he
said
did
not
keep
up
the
standard
of
docility
i
take
my
stand
he
said
on
a
technical
point
i
say
to
myself
downing
is
a
man
i
admire
as
a
human
being
and
respect
as
a
master
in
this
impertinence
is
doing
you
no
good
smith
psmith
waved
a
hand
deprecatingly
if
you
will
let
me
explain
sir
i
was
about
to
say
that
in
any
other
place
but
outwood
house
your
word
would
be
law
i
would
fly
to
do
your
bidding
if
you
pressed
a
button
i
would
do
the
rest
but
in
outwood
house
i
can
not
do
anything
except
what
pleases
me
or
what
is
ordered
by
outwood
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
before
one
can
not
he
continued
as
who
should
say
let
us
be
reasonable
one
can
not
to
take
a
parallel
case
imagine
the
colonel
commanding
the
garrison
at
a
naval
station
going
on
board
a
battleship
and
ordering
the
crew
to
splice
the
jibboom
spanker
it
might
be
an
admirable
thing
for
the
empire
that
the
jibboom
spanker
be
spliced
at
that
particular
juncture
but
the
crew
would
naturally
decline
to
move
in
the
matter
until
the
order
came
from
the
commander
of
the
ship
so
in
my
case
if
you
will
go
to
outwood
explain
to
him
how
matters
stand
and
come
back
and
say
to
me
outwood
wishes
you
to
ask
him
to
be
good
enough
to
come
to
this
study
then
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
go
and
find
him
you
see
my
difficulty
sir
go
and
fetch
outwood
smith
i
shall
not
tell
you
again
psmith
flicked
a
speck
of
dust
from
his
coat
sleeve
very
well
smith
i
can
assure
you
sir
at
any
rate
that
if
there
is
a
shoe
in
that
cupboard
now
there
will
be
a
shoe
there
when
you
return
mr
downing
stalked
out
of
the
room
but
added
psmith
pensively
to
himself
as
the
footsteps
died
away
i
did
not
promise
that
it
would
be
the
same
shoe
he
took
the
key
from
his
pocket
unlocked
the
cupboard
and
took
out
the
shoe
then
he
selected
from
the
basket
a
particularly
battered
specimen
placing
this
in
the
cupboard
he
relocked
the
door
his
next
act
was
to
take
from
the
shelf
a
piece
of
string
attaching
one
end
of
this
to
the
shoe
that
he
had
taken
from
the
cupboard
he
went
to
the
window
his
first
act
was
to
fling
the
cupboard
key
out
into
the
bushes
then
he
turned
to
the
shoe
on
a
level
with
the
sill
the
water
pipe
up
which
mike
had
started
to
climb
the
night
before
was
fastened
to
the
wall
by
an
iron
band
he
tied
the
other
end
of
the
string
to
this
and
let
the
shoe
swing
free
he
noticed
with
approval
when
it
had
stopped
swinging
that
it
was
hidden
from
above
by
the
windowsill
he
returned
to
his
place
at
the
mantelpiece
as
an
afterthought
he
took
another
shoe
from
the
basket
and
thrust
it
up
the
chimney
a
shower
of
soot
fell
into
the
grate
blackening
his
hand
the
bathroom
was
a
few
yards
down
the
corridor
he
went
there
and
washed
off
the
soot
when
he
returned
mr
downing
was
in
the
study
and
with
him
outwood
the
latter
looking
dazed
as
if
he
were
not
quite
equal
to
the
intellectual
pressure
of
the
situation
where
have
you
been
smith
asked
mr
downing
sharply
i
have
been
washing
my
hands
sir
h
said
mr
downing
suspiciously
yes
i
saw
smith
go
into
the
bathroom
said
outwood
smith
i
can
not
quite
understand
what
it
is
mr
downing
wishes
me
to
do
my
dear
outwood
snapped
the
sleuth
i
thought
i
had
made
it
perfectly
clear
where
is
the
difficulty
i
can
not
understand
why
you
should
suspect
smith
of
keeping
his
shoes
in
a
cupboard
and
added
outwood
with
spirit
catching
sight
of
a
look
on
the
other
face
why
he
should
not
do
so
if
he
wishes
it
exactly
sir
said
psmith
approvingly
you
have
touched
the
spot
if
i
must
explain
again
my
dear
outwood
will
you
kindly
give
me
your
attention
for
a
moment
last
night
a
boy
broke
out
of
your
house
and
painted
my
dog
sampson
red
he
painted
said
outwood
why
i
do
know
why
at
any
rate
he
did
during
the
escapade
one
of
his
shoes
was
splashed
with
the
paint
it
is
that
shoe
which
i
believe
smith
to
be
concealing
in
this
cupboard
now
do
you
understand
outwood
looked
amazedly
at
psmith
and
psmith
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
at
outwood
psmith
expression
said
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
spoken
the
words
we
must
humor
him
so
with
your
permission
as
smith
declares
that
he
has
lost
the
key
i
propose
to
break
open
the
door
of
this
cupboard
have
you
any
objection
outwood
started
objection
none
at
all
my
dear
fellow
none
at
all
let
me
see
is
it
you
wish
to
do
this
said
mr
downing
shortly
there
was
a
pair
of
dumbbells
on
the
floor
belonging
to
mike
he
never
used
them
but
they
always
managed
to
get
themselves
packed
with
the
rest
of
his
belongings
on
the
last
day
of
the
holidays
mr
downing
seized
one
of
these
and
delivered
two
rapid
blows
at
the
cupboard
door
the
wood
splintered
a
third
blow
smashed
the
flimsy
lock
the
cupboard
with
any
skeletons
it
might
contain
was
open
for
all
to
view
mr
downing
uttered
a
cry
of
triumph
and
tore
the
shoe
from
its
resting
place
i
told
you
he
said
i
told
you
i
wondered
where
that
shoe
had
got
to
said
psmith
i
been
looking
for
it
for
days
mr
downing
was
examining
his
find
he
looked
up
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
wrath
this
shoe
has
no
paint
on
it
he
said
glaring
at
psmith
this
is
not
the
shoe
it
certainly
appears
sir
said
psmith
sympathetically
to
be
free
from
paint
there
a
sort
of
reddish
glow
just
there
if
you
look
at
it
sideways
he
added
helpfully
did
you
place
that
shoe
there
smith
i
must
have
done
then
when
i
lost
the
key
are
you
satisfied
now
downing
interrupted
outwood
with
asperity
or
is
there
any
more
furniture
you
wish
to
break
the
excitement
of
seeing
his
household
goods
smashed
with
a
dumbbell
had
made
the
archaeological
student
quite
a
swashbuckler
for
the
moment
a
little
more
and
one
could
imagine
him
giving
mr
downing
a
good
hard
knock
the
stood
still
for
a
moment
baffled
but
his
brain
was
working
with
the
rapidity
of
a
buzz
saw
a
chance
remark
of
outwood
set
him
fizzing
off
on
the
trail
once
more
outwood
had
caught
sight
of
the
little
pile
of
soot
in
the
grate
he
bent
down
to
inspect
it
dear
me
he
said
i
must
remember
to
have
the
chimneys
swept
it
should
have
been
done
before
mr
downing
eye
rolling
in
a
fine
frenzy
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
also
focused
itself
on
the
pile
of
soot
and
a
thrill
went
through
him
soot
in
the
fireplace
smith
washing
his
hands
you
know
my
methods
my
dear
watson
apply
them
mr
downing
mind
at
that
moment
contained
one
single
thought
and
that
thought
was
what
ho
for
the
chimney
he
dived
forward
with
a
rush
nearly
knocking
outwood
off
his
feet
and
thrust
an
arm
up
into
the
unknown
an
avalanche
of
soot
fell
upon
his
hand
and
wrist
but
he
ignored
it
for
at
the
same
instant
his
fingers
had
closed
upon
what
he
was
seeking
ah
he
said
i
thought
as
much
you
were
not
quite
clever
enough
after
all
smith
no
sir
said
psmith
patiently
we
all
make
mistakes
you
would
have
done
better
smith
not
to
have
given
me
all
this
trouble
you
have
done
yourself
no
good
by
it
it
been
great
fun
though
sir
argued
psmith
fun
mr
downing
laughed
grimly
you
may
have
reason
to
change
your
opinion
of
what
constitutes
his
voice
failed
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
toe
of
the
shoe
he
looked
up
and
caught
psmith
benevolent
gaze
he
straightened
himself
and
brushed
a
bead
of
perspiration
from
his
face
with
the
back
of
his
hand
unfortunately
he
used
the
sooty
hand
and
the
result
was
that
he
looked
like
a
chimney
sweep
at
work
did
you
put
that
shoe
there
smith
he
asked
slowly
yes
sir
then
what
did
you
by
putting
it
there
roared
mr
downing
animal
spirits
sir
said
psmith
what
animal
spirits
sir
what
mr
downing
would
have
replied
to
this
one
can
not
tell
though
one
can
guess
roughly
for
just
as
he
was
opening
his
mouth
outwood
catching
sight
of
his
countenance
intervened
my
dear
downing
he
said
your
face
it
is
positively
covered
with
soot
positively
you
must
come
and
wash
it
you
are
quite
black
really
you
present
a
most
curious
appearance
most
let
me
show
you
the
way
to
my
room
in
all
times
of
storm
and
tribulation
there
comes
a
breaking
point
a
point
where
the
spirit
definitely
refuses
to
battle
any
longer
against
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
mr
downing
could
not
bear
up
against
this
crowning
blow
he
went
down
beneath
it
in
the
language
of
the
ring
he
took
the
count
it
was
the
knockout
soot
he
murmured
weakly
soot
your
face
is
covered
my
dear
fellow
quite
covered
it
certainly
has
a
faintly
sooty
aspect
sir
said
psmith
his
voice
roused
the
sufferer
to
one
last
flicker
of
spirit
you
will
hear
more
of
this
smith
he
said
i
say
you
will
hear
more
of
it
then
he
allowed
outwood
to
lead
him
out
to
a
place
where
there
were
towels
soap
and
sponges
when
they
had
gone
psmith
went
to
the
window
and
hauled
in
the
string
he
felt
the
calm
afterglow
which
comes
to
the
general
after
a
successfully
conducted
battle
it
had
been
trying
of
course
for
a
man
of
refinement
and
it
had
cut
into
his
afternoon
but
on
the
whole
it
had
been
worth
it
the
problem
now
was
what
to
do
with
the
painted
shoe
it
would
take
a
lot
of
cleaning
he
saw
even
if
he
could
get
hold
of
the
necessary
implements
for
cleaning
it
and
he
rather
doubted
if
he
would
be
able
to
do
so
edmund
the
worked
in
some
mysterious
cell
far
from
the
madding
crowd
at
the
back
of
the
house
in
the
boot
cupboard
downstairs
there
would
probably
be
nothing
likely
to
be
of
any
use
his
fears
were
realized
the
boot
cupboard
was
empty
it
seemed
to
him
that
for
the
time
being
the
best
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
place
the
shoe
in
safe
hiding
until
he
would
have
thought
out
a
scheme
having
restored
the
basket
to
its
proper
place
accordingly
he
went
up
to
the
study
again
and
placed
the
shoe
in
the
chimney
at
about
the
same
height
where
mr
downing
had
found
the
other
nobody
would
think
of
looking
there
a
second
time
and
it
was
improbable
that
outwood
really
would
have
the
chimneys
swept
as
he
had
said
the
odds
were
that
he
had
forgotten
about
it
already
psmith
went
to
the
bathroom
to
wash
his
hands
again
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
done
a
good
day
work
on
the
trail
again
the
most
massive
minds
are
apt
to
forget
things
at
times
the
most
adroit
plotters
make
their
little
mistakes
psmith
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
he
made
the
mistake
of
not
telling
mike
of
the
happenings
it
was
not
altogether
forgetfulness
psmith
was
one
of
those
people
who
like
to
carry
through
their
operations
entirely
by
themselves
where
there
is
only
one
in
a
secret
the
secret
is
more
liable
to
remain
unrevealed
there
was
nothing
he
thought
to
be
gained
from
telling
mike
he
forgot
what
the
consequences
might
be
if
he
did
not
so
psmith
kept
his
own
counsel
with
the
result
that
mike
went
over
to
school
on
the
monday
morning
in
gym
shoes
edmund
summoned
from
the
hinterland
of
the
house
to
give
his
opinion
why
only
one
of
mike
shoes
was
to
be
found
had
no
views
on
the
subject
he
seemed
to
look
on
it
as
one
of
these
things
which
no
fellow
can
understand
one
of
jackson
he
said
as
if
he
hoped
that
mike
might
be
satisfied
with
a
compromise
one
what
the
good
of
that
edmund
you
chump
i
ca
go
over
to
school
in
one
shoe
edmund
turned
this
over
in
his
mind
and
then
said
no
sir
as
much
as
to
say
i
may
have
lost
a
shoe
but
thank
goodness
i
can
still
understand
sound
reasoning
well
what
am
i
to
do
where
the
other
shoe
do
know
jackson
replied
edmund
to
both
questions
well
i
mean
oh
dash
it
there
the
bell
and
mike
sprinted
off
in
the
gym
shoes
he
stood
in
it
is
only
a
deviation
from
those
ordinary
rules
of
school
life
which
one
observes
naturally
and
without
thinking
that
enables
one
to
realize
how
strong
prejudices
really
are
at
a
school
for
instance
where
the
regulations
say
that
coats
only
of
black
or
dark
blue
are
to
be
worn
a
boy
who
appears
one
day
in
even
the
most
respectable
and
unostentatious
brown
finds
himself
looked
on
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
repulsion
which
would
be
excessive
if
he
had
sandbagged
the
headmaster
so
in
the
case
of
shoes
school
rules
decree
that
a
boy
shall
go
to
his
form
room
in
shoes
there
is
no
real
reason
why
if
the
day
is
fine
he
should
not
wear
gym
shoes
should
he
prefer
them
but
if
he
does
the
thing
creates
a
perfect
sensation
boys
say
great
scott
what
you
got
on
masters
say
jones
are
you
wearing
on
your
feet
in
the
few
minutes
which
elapse
between
the
assembling
of
the
form
for
and
the
arrival
of
the
form
master
some
wag
is
sure
either
to
stamp
on
the
gym
shoes
accompanying
the
act
with
some
satirical
remark
or
else
to
pull
one
of
them
off
and
inaugurate
an
impromptu
game
of
football
with
it
there
was
once
a
boy
who
went
to
school
one
morning
in
boots
mike
had
always
been
coldly
distant
in
his
relations
to
the
rest
of
his
form
looking
on
them
with
a
few
exceptions
as
worms
and
the
form
since
his
innings
against
downing
on
the
friday
had
regarded
mike
with
respect
so
that
he
escaped
the
ragging
he
would
have
had
to
undergo
at
wrykyn
in
similar
circumstance
it
was
only
mr
downing
who
gave
trouble
there
is
a
sort
of
instinct
which
enables
some
masters
to
tell
when
a
boy
in
their
form
is
wearing
gym
shoes
instead
of
the
more
formal
kind
just
as
people
who
dislike
cats
always
know
when
one
is
in
a
room
with
them
they
can
not
see
it
but
they
feel
it
in
their
bones
mr
downing
was
perhaps
the
most
bigoted
in
the
whole
list
of
english
schoolmasters
he
waged
war
remorselessly
against
gym
shoes
satire
abuse
lines
detention
every
weapon
was
employed
by
him
in
dealing
with
their
wearers
it
had
been
the
late
dunster
practice
always
to
go
over
to
school
in
gym
shoes
when
as
he
usually
did
he
felt
shaky
in
the
morning
lesson
mr
downing
always
detected
him
in
the
first
five
minutes
and
that
meant
a
lecture
of
anything
from
ten
minutes
to
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
untidy
habits
and
boys
who
looked
like
loafers
which
broke
the
back
of
the
morning
work
nicely
on
one
occasion
when
a
particularly
tricky
bit
of
livy
was
on
the
bill
of
fare
dunster
had
entered
the
form
room
in
heelless
turkish
bath
slippers
of
a
vivid
crimson
and
the
subsequent
proceedings
including
his
journey
over
to
the
house
to
change
the
heelless
atrocities
had
seen
him
through
very
nearly
to
the
interval
mike
accordingly
had
not
been
in
his
place
for
three
minutes
when
mr
downing
stiffening
like
a
pointer
called
his
name
yes
sir
said
mike
are
you
wearing
on
your
feet
jackson
gym
shoes
sir
you
are
wearing
gym
shoes
are
you
not
aware
that
gym
shoes
are
not
the
proper
things
to
come
to
school
in
why
are
you
wearing
gym

the
form
leaning
back
against
the
next
row
of
desks
settled
itself
comfortably
for
the
address
from
the
throne
i
have
lost
one
of
my
shoes
sir
a
kind
of
gulp
escaped
from
mr
downing
lips
he
stared
at
mike
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
turning
to
stone
he
told
him
to
start
translating
stone
who
had
been
expecting
at
least
ten
minutes
respite
was
taken
unawares
when
he
found
the
place
in
his
book
and
began
to
construe
he
floundered
hopelessly
but
to
his
growing
surprise
and
satisfaction
the
form
master
appeared
to
notice
nothing
wrong
he
said
yes
yes
mechanically
and
finally
that
will
do
whereupon
stone
resumed
his
seat
with
the
feeling
that
the
age
of
miracles
had
returned
mr
downing
mind
was
in
a
whirl
his
case
was
complete
appearance
in
gym
shoes
with
the
explanation
that
he
had
lost
a
shoe
completed
the
chain
as
columbus
must
have
felt
when
his
ship
ran
into
harbor
and
the
first
american
interviewer
jumping
on
board
said
wal
sir
and
what
are
your
impressions
of
our
glorious
country
so
did
mr
downing
feel
at
that
moment
when
the
bell
rang
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
he
gathered
up
his
gown
and
sped
to
the
headmaster
the
adair
method
it
was
during
the
interval
that
day
that
stone
and
robinson
discussing
the
subject
of
cricket
over
a
bun
and
ginger
beer
at
the
school
shop
came
to
a
momentous
decision
to
wit
that
they
were
fed
up
with
the
adair
administration
and
meant
to
strike
the
immediate
cause
of
revolt
was
fielding
practice
that
searching
test
of
cricket
keenness
mike
himself
to
whom
cricket
was
the
great
and
serious
interest
in
life
had
shirked
fielding
practice
in
his
first
term
at
wrykyn
and
stone
and
robinson
had
but
a
lukewarm
attachment
to
the
game
compared
with
mike
as
a
rule
adair
had
contented
himself
with
practice
in
the
afternoon
after
school
which
nobody
objects
to
and
no
strain
consequently
had
been
put
upon
stone
and
robinson
allegiance
in
view
of
the
match
on
the
wednesday
however
he
had
now
added
to
this
an
extra
dose
to
be
taken
before
breakfast
stone
and
robinson
had
left
their
comfortable
beds
that
day
at
six
yawning
and
and
had
caught
catches
and
fielded
drives
which
in
the
cool
morning
air
had
stung
like
adders
and
bitten
like
serpents
until
the
sun
has
really
got
to
work
it
is
no
joke
taking
a
high
catch
stone
dislike
of
the
experiment
was
only
equaled
by
robinson
they
were
neither
of
them
of
the
type
which
likes
to
undergo
hardships
for
the
common
good
they
played
well
enough
when
on
the
field
but
neither
cared
greatly
whether
the
school
had
a
good
season
or
not
they
played
the
games
entirely
for
their
own
sakes
the
result
was
that
they
went
back
to
the
house
for
breakfast
with
a
feeling
and
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
met
to
debate
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
about
it
at
all
costs
another
experience
like
today
must
be
avoided
it
all
rot
said
stone
what
on
earth
the
good
of
sweating
about
before
breakfast
it
only
makes
you
tired
i
should
wonder
said
robinson
if
it
was
bad
for
the
heart
rushing
about
on
an
empty
stomach
i
mean
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
personally
said
stone
gnawing
his
bun
i
do
intend
to
stick
it
nor
do
i
i
mean
it
such
absolute
rot
if
we
are
good
enough
to
play
for
the
team
without
having
to
get
up
overnight
to
catch
catches
better
find
somebody
else
yes
at
this
moment
adair
came
into
the
shop
fielding
practice
again
tomorrow
he
said
briskly
at
six
before
breakfast
said
robinson
rather
you
two
must
buck
up
you
know
you
were
rotten
today
and
he
passed
on
leaving
the
two
malcontents
speechless
stone
was
the
first
to
recover
i
hanged
if
i
turn
out
tomorrow
he
said
as
they
left
the
shop
he
can
do
what
he
likes
about
it
besides
what
can
he
do
after
all
only
kick
us
out
of
the
team
and
i
do
mind
that
nor
do
i
i
do
think
he
will
kick
us
out
either
he
ca
play
the
with
a
scratch
team
if
he
does
we
go
and
play
for
that
village
jackson
plays
for
we
get
jackson
to
shove
us
into
the
team
all
right
said
robinson
let
their
position
was
a
strong
one
a
cricket
captain
may
seem
to
be
an
autocrat
of
tremendous
power
but
in
reality
he
has
only
one
weapon
the
keenness
of
those
under
him
with
the
majority
of
course
the
fear
of
being
excluded
or
ejected
from
a
team
is
a
spur
that
drives
the
majority
consequently
are
easily
handled
but
when
a
cricket
captain
runs
up
against
a
boy
who
does
not
much
care
whether
he
plays
for
the
team
or
not
then
he
finds
himself
in
a
difficult
position
and
unless
he
is
a
man
of
action
practically
helpless
stone
and
robinson
felt
secure
taking
it
all
around
they
felt
that
they
would
just
as
soon
play
for
lower
borlock
as
for
the
school
the
bowling
of
the
opposition
would
be
weaker
in
the
former
case
and
the
chance
of
making
runs
greater
to
a
certain
type
of
cricketer
runs
are
runs
wherever
and
however
made
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
adair
turning
out
with
the
team
next
morning
for
fielding
practice
found
himself
two
short
barnes
was
among
those
present
but
of
the
other
two
representatives
of
outwood
house
there
were
no
signs
barnes
questioned
on
the
subject
had
no
information
to
give
beyond
the
fact
that
he
had
not
seen
them
about
anywhere
which
was
not
a
great
help
adair
proceeded
with
the
fielding
practice
without
further
delay
at
breakfast
that
morning
he
was
silent
and
apparently
rapt
in
thought
mr
downing
who
sat
at
the
top
of
the
table
with
adair
on
his
right
was
accustomed
at
the
morning
meal
to
blend
nourishment
of
the
body
with
that
of
the
mind
as
a
rule
he
had
ten
minutes
with
the
daily
paper
before
the
bell
rang
and
it
was
his
practice
to
hand
on
the
results
of
his
reading
to
adair
and
the
other
house
prefects
who
not
having
seen
the
paper
usually
formed
an
interested
and
appreciative
audience
today
however
though
the
house
prefects
expressed
varying
degrees
of
excitement
at
the
news
that
sheppard
had
made
a
century
against
gloucestershire
and
that
a
butter
famine
was
expected
in
the
united
states
these
news
items
seemed
to
leave
adair
cold
he
champed
his
bread
and
marmalade
with
an
abstracted
air
he
was
wondering
what
to
do
in
the
matter
of
stone
and
robinson
many
captains
might
have
passed
the
thing
over
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
missing
pair
had
overslept
themselves
would
have
been
a
safe
and
convenient
way
out
of
the
difficulty
but
adair
was
not
the
sort
of
person
who
seeks
for
safe
and
convenient
ways
out
of
difficulties
he
never
shirked
anything
physical
or
moral
he
resolved
to
interview
the
absentees
it
was
not
until
after
school
that
an
opportunity
offered
itself
he
went
across
to
outwood
and
found
the
two
nonstarters
in
the
senior
day
room
engaged
in
the
intellectual
pursuit
of
kicking
the
wall
and
marking
the
height
of
each
kick
with
chalk
adair
entrance
coincided
with
a
record
effort
by
stone
which
caused
the
kicker
to
overbalance
and
stagger
backward
against
the
captain
sorry
said
stone
hello
adair
do
mention
it
why
were
you
two
at
fielding
practice
this
morning
robinson
who
left
the
lead
to
stone
in
all
matters
said
nothing
stone
spoke
we
did
turn
up
he
said
i
know
you
did
why
not
stone
had
rehearsed
this
scene
in
his
mind
and
he
spoke
with
the
coolness
which
comes
from
rehearsal
we
decided
not
to
oh
yes
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
had
any
use
for
fielding
adair
manner
became
ominously
calm
you
were
rather
fed
up
i
suppose
that
just
the
word
sorry
it
bored
you
it
did
we
did
give
it
the
chance
to
robinson
laughed
appreciatively
what
the
joke
robinson
asked
adair
there
no
joke
said
robinson
with
some
haste
i
was
only
thinking
of
something
i
give
you
something
else
to
think
about
soon
stone
intervened
it
no
good
making
a
row
about
it
adair
you
must
see
that
you
do
anything
of
course
you
can
kick
us
out
of
the
team
if
you
like
but
we
do
care
if
you
do
jackson
will
get
us
a
game
any
wednesday
or
saturday
for
the
village
he
plays
for
so
we
all
right
and
the
school
team
are
such
a
lot
of
flyers
that
you
can
afford
to
go
chucking
people
out
of
it
whenever
you
want
to
see
what
i
mean
you
and
jackson
seem
to
have
fixed
it
all
up
between
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
kick
us
out
no
good
i
thought
you
see
it
was
no
good
making
a
beastly
row
play
for
the
school
all
right
there
no
earthly
need
for
us
to
turn
out
for
fielding
practice
before
breakfast
you
do
think
there
is
you
may
be
right
all
the
same
you
going
to
tomorrow
morning
what
six
sharp
do
be
late
do
be
an
ass
adair
we
told
you
we
are
going
to
that
only
your
opinion
i
think
you
are
i
give
you
till
five
past
six
as
you
seem
to
like
lying
in
bed
you
can
turn
out
if
you
feel
like
it
you
wo
find
me
there
that
be
a
disappointment
nor
robinson
no
said
the
junior
partner
in
the
firm
but
he
said
it
without
any
deep
conviction
the
atmosphere
was
growing
a
great
deal
too
tense
for
his
comfort
you
quite
made
up
your
minds
yes
said
stone
right
said
adair
quietly
and
knocked
him
down
he
was
up
again
in
a
moment
adair
had
pushed
the
table
back
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
open
space
you
cad
said
stone
i
was
ready
well
you
are
now
shall
we
go
on
stone
dashed
in
without
a
word
and
for
a
few
moments
the
two
might
have
seemed
evenly
matched
to
a
not
too
intelligent
spectator
but
science
tells
even
in
a
confined
space
adair
was
smaller
and
lighter
than
stone
but
he
was
cooler
and
quicker
and
he
knew
more
about
the
game
his
blow
was
always
home
a
fraction
of
a
second
sooner
than
his
opponent
at
the
end
of
a
minute
stone
was
on
the
floor
again
he
got
up
slowly
and
stood
leaning
with
one
hand
on
the
table
suppose
we
say
ten
past
six
said
adair
i
not
particular
to
a
minute
or
two
stone
made
no
reply
will
ten
past
six
suit
you
for
fielding
practice
tomorrow
said
adair
all
right
said
stone
thanks
how
about
you
robinson
robinson
had
been
a
petrified
spectator
of
the
maneuvers
of
the
cricket
captain
and
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
make
up
his
mind
he
was
not
altogether
a
coward
in
different
circumstances
he
might
have
put
up
a
respectable
show
but
it
takes
a
more
than
ordinarily
courageous
person
to
embark
on
a
fight
which
he
knows
must
end
in
his
destruction
robinson
knew
that
he
was
nothing
like
a
match
even
for
stone
and
adair
had
disposed
of
stone
in
a
little
over
one
minute
it
seemed
to
robinson
that
neither
pleasure
nor
profit
was
likely
to
come
from
an
encounter
with
adair
all
right
he
said
hastily
i
turn
up
good
said
adair
i
wonder
if
either
of
you
chaps
could
tell
me
which
is
jackson
study
stone
was
dabbing
at
his
mouth
with
a
handkerchief
a
task
which
precluded
anything
in
the
shape
of
conversation
so
robinson
replied
that
mike
study
was
the
first
you
came
to
on
the
right
of
the
corridor
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
thanks
said
adair
you
do
happen
to
know
if
he
in
i
suppose
he
went
up
with
smith
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
i
do
know
if
still
there
i
go
and
see
said
adair
i
should
like
a
word
with
him
if
he
is
busy
adair
has
a
word
with
mike
mike
all
unconscious
of
the
stirring
proceedings
which
had
been
going
on
below
stairs
was
peacefully
reading
a
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
from
strachan
at
wrykyn
in
which
the
successor
to
the
cricket
captaincy
which
should
have
been
mike
had
a
good
deal
to
say
in
a
lugubrious
strain
in
mike
absence
things
had
been
going
badly
with
wrykyn
a
broken
arm
contracted
in
the
course
of
some
rash
experiments
with
a
day
boy
motor
bicycle
had
deprived
the
team
of
the
services
of
dunstable
the
only
man
who
had
shown
any
signs
of
being
able
to
bowl
a
side
out
since
this
calamity
wrote
strachan
everything
had
gone
wrong
the
led
by
mike
brother
reggie
the
least
of
the
three
cricketing
jacksons
had
smashed
them
by
a
hundred
and
fifty
runs
geddington
had
wiped
them
off
the
face
of
the
earth
the
incogs
with
a
team
recruited
exclusively
from
the
rabbit
hutch
not
a
man
on
the
side
except
stacey
a
veteran
who
had
been
playing
for
the
club
for
nearly
half
a
century
had
got
home
by
two
wickets
in
fact
it
was
strachan
opinion
that
the
wrykyn
team
that
summer
was
about
the
most
hopeless
gang
of
deadbeats
that
had
ever
made
exhibition
of
itself
on
the
school
grounds
the
ripton
match
fortunately
was
off
owing
to
an
outbreak
of
mumps
at
that
shrine
of
learning
and
athletics
the
second
outbreak
of
the
malady
in
two
terms
which
said
strachan
was
hard
lines
on
ripton
but
a
bit
of
jolly
good
luck
for
wrykyn
as
it
had
saved
them
from
what
would
probably
have
been
a
record
hammering
ripton
having
eight
of
their
last
year
team
left
including
dixon
the
fast
bowler
against
whom
mike
alone
of
the
wrykyn
team
had
been
able
to
make
runs
in
the
previous
season
altogether
wrykyn
had
struck
a
bad
patch
mike
mourned
over
his
suffering
school
if
only
he
could
have
been
there
to
help
it
might
have
made
all
the
difference
in
school
cricket
one
good
batsman
to
go
in
first
and
knock
the
bowlers
off
their
length
may
take
a
weak
team
triumphantly
through
a
season
in
school
cricket
the
importance
of
a
good
start
for
the
first
wicket
is
incalculable
as
he
put
strachan
letter
away
in
his
pocket
all
his
old
bitterness
against
sedleigh
which
had
been
ebbing
during
the
past
few
days
returned
with
a
rush
he
was
conscious
once
more
of
that
feeling
of
personal
injury
which
had
made
him
hate
his
new
school
on
the
first
day
of
term
and
it
was
at
this
point
when
his
resentment
was
at
its
height
that
adair
the
concrete
representative
of
everything
sedleighan
entered
the
room
there
are
moments
in
life
placid
course
when
there
has
got
to
be
the
biggest
kind
of
row
this
was
one
of
them
psmith
who
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
reading
the
serial
story
in
a
daily
paper
which
he
had
abstracted
from
the
senior
day
room
made
the
intruder
free
of
the
study
with
a
dignified
wave
of
the
hand
and
went
on
reading
mike
remained
in
the
deck
chair
in
which
he
was
sitting
and
contented
himself
with
glaring
at
the
newcomer
psmith
was
the
first
to
speak
if
you
ask
my
candid
opinion
he
said
looking
up
from
his
paper
i
should
say
that
young
lord
antony
trefusis
was
in
the
soup
already
i
seem
to
see
the
consommé
splashing
about
his
ankles
he
had
a
note
telling
him
to
be
under
the
oak
tree
in
the
park
at
midnight
he
just
off
there
at
the
end
of
this
installment
i
bet
long
jack
the
poacher
is
waiting
there
with
a
sandbag
care
to
see
the
paper
comrade
adair
or
do
you
take
any
interest
in
contemporary
literature
thanks
said
adair
i
just
wanted
to
speak
to
jackson
for
a
minute
fate
said
psmith
has
led
your
footsteps
to
the
right
place
this
is
comrade
jackson
the
pride
of
the
school
sitting
before
you
what
do
you
want
said
mike
he
suspected
that
adair
had
come
to
ask
him
once
again
to
play
for
the
school
the
fact
that
the
match
was
on
the
following
day
made
this
a
probable
solution
of
the
reason
for
his
visit
he
could
think
of
no
other
errand
that
was
likely
to
have
set
the
head
of
downing
paying
afternoon
calls
i
tell
you
in
a
minute
it
wo
take
long
that
said
psmith
approvingly
is
right
speed
is
the
keynote
of
the
present
age
promptitude
dispatch
this
is
no
time
for
loitering
we
must
be
strenuous
we
must
hustle
we
must
do
it
now
we
buck
up
said
mike
certainly
said
adair
i
just
been
talking
to
stone
and
robinson
an
excellent
way
of
passing
an
idle
half
hour
said
psmith
we
were
exactly
idle
said
adair
grimly
it
did
last
long
but
it
was
pretty
lively
while
it
did
stone
chucked
it
after
the
first
round
mike
got
up
out
of
his
chair
he
could
not
quite
follow
what
all
this
was
about
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
truculence
of
adair
manner
for
some
reason
which
might
possibly
be
made
clear
later
adair
was
looking
for
trouble
and
mike
in
his
present
mood
felt
that
it
would
be
a
privilege
to
see
that
he
got
it
psmith
was
regarding
adair
through
his
eyeglass
with
pain
and
surprise
surely
he
said
you
do
not
mean
us
to
understand
that
you
have
been
with
comrade
stone
this
is
bad
hearing
i
thought
that
you
and
he
were
like
brothers
such
a
bad
example
for
comrade
robinson
too
leave
us
adair
we
would
brood
go
thee
knave
i
none
of
thee
shakespeare
psmith
turned
away
and
resting
his
elbows
on
the
mantelpiece
gazed
at
himself
mournfully
in
the
looking
glass
i
not
the
man
i
was
he
sighed
after
a
prolonged
inspection
there
are
lines
on
my
face
dark
circles
beneath
my
eyes
the
fierce
rush
of
life
at
sedleigh
is
wasting
me
away
stone
and
i
had
a
discussion
about
fielding
practice
said
adair
turning
to
mike
mike
said
nothing
i
thought
his
fielding
wanted
working
up
a
bit
so
i
told
him
to
turn
out
at
six
tomorrow
morning
he
said
he
would
so
we
argued
it
out
he
going
to
all
right
so
is
robinson
mike
remained
silent
so
are
you
said
adair
i
get
thinner
and
thinner
said
psmith
from
the
mantelpiece
mike
looked
at
adair
and
adair
looked
at
mike
after
the
manner
of
two
dogs
before
they
fly
at
one
another
there
was
an
electric
silence
in
the
study
psmith
peered
with
increased
earnestness
into
the
glass
oh
said
mike
at
last
what
makes
you
think
that
i
do
think
i
know
any
special
reason
for
my
turning
out
yes
what
that
you
going
to
play
for
the
school
against
the
tomorrow
and
i
want
you
to
get
some
practice
i
wonder
how
you
got
that
idea
curious
i
should
have
done
is
it
very
you
are
building
on
it
much
are
you
said
mike
politely
i
am
rather
replied
adair
with
equal
courtesy
i
afraid
you
be
disappointed
i
do
think
so
my
eyes
said
psmith
regretfully
are
a
bit
close
together
however
he
added
philosophically
it
too
late
to
alter
that
now
mike
drew
a
step
closer
to
adair
what
makes
you
think
i
shall
play
against
the
he
asked
curiously
i
going
to
make
you
mike
took
another
step
forward
adair
moved
to
meet
him
would
you
care
to
try
now
said
mike
for
just
one
second
the
two
drew
themselves
together
preparatory
to
beginning
the
serious
business
of
the
interview
and
in
that
second
psmith
turning
from
the
glass
stepped
between
them
get
out
of
the
light
smith
said
mike
psmith
waved
him
back
with
a
deprecating
gesture
my
dear
young
friends
he
said
placidly
if
you
let
your
angry
passions
rise
against
the
direct
advice
of
doctor
watts
i
suppose
you
must
but
when
you
propose
to
claw
each
other
in
my
study
in
the
midst
of
a
hundred
fragile
and
priceless
ornaments
i
lodge
a
protest
if
you
really
feel
that
you
want
to
scrap
for
goodness
sake
do
it
where
there
some
room
i
do
want
all
the
study
furniture
smashed
i
know
a
bank
whereon
the
wild
thyme
grows
only
a
few
yards
down
the
road
where
you
can
scrap
all
night
if
you
want
to
how
would
it
be
to
move
on
there
any
objections
none
then
shift
ho
and
let
get
it
over
clearing
the
air
psmith
was
one
of
those
people
who
lend
a
dignity
to
everything
they
touch
under
his
auspices
the
most
unpromising
ventures
became
somehow
enveloped
in
an
atmosphere
of
measured
stateliness
on
the
present
occasion
what
would
have
been
without
his
guiding
hand
a
mere
unscientific
scramble
took
on
something
of
the
impressive
formality
of
the
national
sporting
club
the
rounds
he
said
producing
a
watch
as
they
passed
through
a
gate
into
a
field
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
the
house
gate
will
be
of
three
minutes
duration
with
a
minute
rest
in
between
a
man
who
is
down
will
have
ten
seconds
in
which
to
rise
are
you
ready
comrades
adair
and
jackson
very
well
then
time
after
which
it
was
a
pity
that
the
actual
fight
did
not
quite
live
up
to
its
referee
introduction
dramatically
there
should
have
been
cautious
sparring
for
openings
and
a
number
of
tensely
contested
rounds
as
if
it
had
been
the
final
of
a
boxing
competition
but
school
fights
when
they
do
occur
which
is
only
once
in
a
decade
nowadays
unless
you
count
junior
school
scuffles
are
the
outcome
of
weeks
of
suppressed
bad
blood
and
are
consequently
brief
and
furious
in
a
boxing
competition
however
much
one
may
want
to
win
one
does
not
dislike
one
opponent
up
to
the
moment
when
time
was
called
one
was
probably
warmly
attached
to
him
and
at
the
end
of
the
last
round
one
expects
to
resume
that
attitude
of
mind
in
a
fight
each
party
as
a
rule
hates
the
other
so
it
happened
that
there
was
nothing
formal
or
cautious
about
the
present
battle
all
adair
wanted
was
to
get
at
mike
and
all
mike
wanted
was
to
get
at
adair
directly
psmith
called
time
they
rushed
together
as
if
they
meant
to
end
the
thing
in
half
a
minute
it
was
this
that
saved
mike
in
an
ordinary
contest
with
the
gloves
with
his
opponent
cool
and
boxing
in
his
true
form
he
could
not
have
lasted
three
rounds
against
adair
the
latter
was
a
clever
boxer
while
mike
had
never
had
a
lesson
in
his
life
if
adair
had
kept
away
and
used
his
head
nothing
could
have
prevented
his
winning
as
it
was
however
he
threw
away
his
advantages
much
as
tom
brown
did
at
the
beginning
of
his
fight
with
slogger
williams
and
the
result
was
the
same
as
on
that
historic
occasion
mike
had
the
greater
strength
and
thirty
seconds
from
the
start
knocked
his
man
clean
off
his
feet
with
an
unscientific
but
powerful
righthander
this
finished
adair
chances
he
rose
full
of
fight
but
with
all
the
science
knocked
out
of
him
he
went
in
at
mike
with
both
hands
the
irish
blood
in
him
which
for
the
ordinary
events
of
life
made
him
merely
energetic
and
dashing
now
rendered
him
reckless
he
abandoned
all
attempt
at
guarding
it
was
the
frontal
attack
in
its
most
futile
form
and
as
unsuccessful
as
a
frontal
attack
is
apt
to
be
there
was
a
swift
exchange
of
blows
in
the
course
of
which
mike
left
elbow
coming
into
contact
with
his
opponent
right
fist
got
a
shock
which
kept
it
tingling
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
then
adair
went
down
in
a
heap
he
got
up
slowly
and
with
difficulty
for
a
moment
he
stood
blinking
vaguely
then
he
lurched
forward
at
mike
in
the
excitement
of
a
fight
which
is
after
all
about
the
most
exciting
thing
that
ever
happens
to
one
in
the
course
of
one
life
it
is
difficult
for
the
fighters
to
see
what
the
spectators
see
where
the
spectators
see
an
assault
on
an
already
beaten
man
the
fighter
himself
only
sees
a
legitimate
piece
of
against
an
opponent
whose
chances
are
equal
to
his
own
psmith
saw
as
anybody
looking
on
would
have
seen
that
adair
was
done
mike
blow
had
taken
him
within
a
fraction
of
an
inch
of
the
point
of
the
jaw
and
he
was
all
but
knocked
out
mike
could
not
see
this
all
he
understood
was
that
his
man
was
on
his
feet
again
and
coming
at
him
so
he
hit
out
with
all
his
strength
and
this
time
adair
went
down
and
stayed
down
brief
said
psmith
coming
forward
but
exciting
we
may
take
that
i
think
to
be
the
conclusion
of
the
entertainment
i
will
now
have
a
dash
at
picking
up
the
slain
i
should
stop
if
i
were
you
he
be
sitting
up
and
taking
notice
soon
and
if
he
sees
you
he
may
want
to
go
on
with
the
combat
which
would
do
him
no
earthly
good
if
it
going
to
be
continued
in
our
next
there
had
better
be
a
bit
of
an
interval
for
alterations
and
repairs
first
is
he
hurt
much
do
you
think
asked
mike
he
had
seen
knockouts
before
in
the
ring
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
effected
one
on
his
own
account
and
adair
looked
unpleasantly
corpselike
all
right
said
psmith
in
a
minute
or
two
he
be
skipping
about
like
a
little
lambkin
i
look
after
him
you
go
away
and
pick
flowers
mike
put
on
his
coat
and
walked
back
to
the
house
he
was
conscious
of
a
perplexing
whirl
of
new
and
strange
emotions
chief
among
which
was
a
curious
feeling
that
he
rather
liked
adair
he
found
himself
thinking
that
adair
was
a
good
chap
that
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
his
point
of
view
and
that
it
was
a
pity
he
had
knocked
him
about
so
much
at
the
same
time
he
felt
an
undeniable
thrill
of
pride
at
having
beaten
him
the
feat
presented
that
interesting
person
mike
jackson
to
him
in
a
fresh
and
pleasing
light
as
one
who
had
had
a
tough
job
to
face
and
had
carried
it
through
jackson
the
cricketer
he
knew
but
jackson
the
deliverer
of
knockout
blows
was
strange
to
him
and
he
found
this
new
acquaintance
a
man
to
be
respected
the
fight
in
fact
had
the
result
which
most
fights
have
if
they
are
fought
fairly
and
until
one
side
has
had
enough
it
revolutionized
mike
view
of
things
it
shook
him
up
and
drained
the
bad
blood
out
of
him
where
before
he
had
seemed
to
himself
to
be
acting
with
massive
dignity
he
now
saw
that
he
had
simply
been
sulking
like
some
wretched
kid
there
had
appeared
to
him
something
rather
fine
in
his
policy
of
refusing
to
identify
himself
in
any
way
with
sedleigh
a
touch
of
the
sort
of
thing
he
now
saw
that
his
attitude
was
to
be
summed
up
in
the
words
play
it
came
upon
mike
with
painful
clearness
that
he
had
been
making
an
ass
of
himself
he
had
come
to
this
conclusion
after
much
earnest
thought
when
psmith
entered
the
study
how
adair
asked
mike
sitting
up
and
taking
nourishment
once
more
we
have
been
chatting
he
not
a
bad
cove
he
all
right
said
mike
there
was
a
pause
psmith
straightened
his
tie
look
here
he
said
i
seldom
interfere
in
terrestrial
strife
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
an
opening
here
for
a
capable
peacemaker
not
afraid
of
work
and
willing
to
give
his
services
in
exchange
for
a
comfortable
home
comrade
adair
rather
a
stoutish
fellow
in
his
way
i
not
much
on
the
up
for
the
old
school
jones
game
but
everyone
to
his
taste
i
should
have
thought
anybody
would
get
overwhelmingly
attached
to
this
abode
of
wrath
but
comrade
adair
seems
to
have
done
it
he
all
for
giving
sedleigh
a
it
not
a
bad
idea
in
its
way
i
do
see
why
one
should
humor
him
apparently
he
been
sweating
since
early
childhood
to
buck
the
school
up
and
as
he
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
term
it
might
be
a
scaly
scheme
to
give
him
a
bit
of
a
if
possible
by
making
the
cricket
season
a
bit
of
a
banger
as
a
start
why
not
drop
him
a
line
to
say
that
you
play
against
the
tomorrow
mike
did
not
reply
at
once
he
was
feeling
better
disposed
toward
adair
and
sedleigh
then
he
had
felt
but
he
was
not
sure
that
he
was
quite
prepared
to
go
as
far
as
a
complete
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
continued
psmith
there
nothing
like
giving
in
to
a
man
a
bit
every
now
and
then
it
broadens
the
soul
and
improves
the
action
of
the
skin
what
seems
to
have
fed
up
comrade
adair
to
a
certain
extent
is
that
stone
apparently
led
him
to
understand
that
you
had
offered
to
give
him
and
robinson
places
in
your
village
team
you
did
of
course
of
course
not
said
mike
indignantly
i
told
him
he
did
know
the
old
spirit
of
the
jacksons
i
said
that
you
would
scorn
to
tarnish
the
jackson
escutcheon
by
not
playing
the
game
my
eloquence
convinced
him
however
to
return
to
the
point
under
discussion
why
not
i
do
what
i
mean
to
say
began
mike
if
your
trouble
is
said
psmith
that
you
fear
that
you
may
be
in
unworthy
company
do
be
an
ass
dismiss
it
am
playing
mike
stared
you
i
said
psmith
breathing
on
a
coat
button
and
polishing
it
with
his
handkerchief
can
you
play
cricket
you
have
discovered
said
psmith
my
secret
sorrow
you
rotting
you
wrong
me
comrade
jackson
then
why
have
you
played
why
have
you
why
did
you
come
and
play
for
lower
borlock
i
mean
the
last
time
i
played
in
a
village
cricket
match
i
was
caught
at
point
by
a
man
in
braces
it
would
have
been
madness
to
risk
another
such
shock
to
my
system
my
nerves
are
so
exquisitely
balanced
that
a
thing
of
that
sort
takes
years
off
my
life
no
but
look
here
smith
bar
rotting
are
you
really
any
good
at
cricket
competent
judges
at
eton
gave
me
to
understand
so
i
was
told
that
this
year
i
should
be
a
certainty
for
lord
but
when
the
cricket
season
came
where
was
i
gone
gone
like
some
beautiful
flower
that
withers
in
the
night
but
you
told
me
you
did
like
cricket
you
said
you
only
liked
watching
it
quite
right
i
do
but
at
schools
where
cricket
is
compulsory
you
have
to
overcome
your
private
prejudices
and
in
time
the
thing
becomes
a
habit
imagine
my
feelings
when
i
found
that
i
was
degenerating
little
by
little
into
a
slow
bowler
with
a
swerve
i
fought
against
it
but
it
was
useless
and
after
a
while
i
gave
up
the
struggle
and
drifted
with
the
stream
last
year
in
a
house
match
psmith
voice
took
on
a
deeper
tone
of
melancholy
i
took
seven
for
thirteen
in
the
second
innings
on
a
hard
wicket
i
did
think
when
i
came
here
that
i
had
found
a
haven
of
rest
but
it
was
not
to
be
i
turn
out
tomorrow
what
comrade
outwood
will
say
when
he
finds
that
his
keenest
archaeological
disciple
has
deserted
i
hate
to
think
however
mike
felt
as
if
a
young
and
powerful
earthquake
had
passed
the
whole
face
of
his
world
had
undergone
a
quick
change
here
was
he
the
recalcitrant
wavering
on
the
point
of
playing
for
the
school
and
here
was
psmith
the
last
person
whom
he
would
have
expected
to
be
a
player
stating
calmly
that
he
had
been
in
the
running
for
a
place
in
the
eton
eleven
then
in
a
flash
mike
understood
he
was
not
by
nature
intuitive
but
he
read
psmith
mind
now
since
the
term
began
he
and
psmith
had
been
acting
on
precisely
similar
motives
just
as
he
had
been
disappointed
of
the
captaincy
of
cricket
at
wrykyn
so
had
psmith
been
disappointed
of
his
place
in
the
eton
team
at
lord
and
they
had
both
worked
it
off
each
in
his
own
way
mike
sullenly
psmith
whimsically
according
to
their
respective
natures
on
sedleigh
if
psmith
therefore
did
not
consider
it
too
much
of
a
to
renounce
his
resolution
not
to
play
for
sedleigh
there
was
nothing
to
stop
mike
doing
so
as
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
wanted
to
do
by
jove
he
said
if
you
playing
i
play
i
write
a
note
to
adair
now
but
i
say
he
stopped
i
hanged
if
i
going
to
turn
out
and
field
before
breakfast
tomorrow
that
all
right
you
wo
have
to
adair
wo
be
there
himself
not
playing
against
the
he
sprained
his
wrist
in
which
peace
is
declared
sprained
his
wrist
said
mike
how
did
he
do
that
during
the
brawl
apparently
one
of
his
efforts
got
home
on
your
elbow
instead
of
your
expressive
countenance
and
whether
it
was
that
your
elbow
was
particularly
tough
or
his
wrist
particularly
fragile
i
know
anyhow
it
went
it
nothing
bad
but
it
keep
him
out
of
the
game
tomorrow
i
say
what
beastly
rough
luck
i
no
idea
i
go
around
not
a
bad
scheme
close
the
door
gently
after
you
and
if
you
see
anybody
downstairs
who
looks
as
if
he
were
likely
to
be
going
over
to
the
shop
ask
him
to
get
me
a
small
pot
of
some
rare
old
jam
and
tell
the
man
to
chalk
it
up
to
me
the
jam
comrade
outwood
supplies
to
us
at
tea
is
all
right
as
a
practical
joke
or
as
a
food
for
those
anxious
to
commit
suicide
but
useless
to
anybody
who
values
life
on
arriving
at
mr
downing
and
going
to
adair
study
mike
found
that
his
late
antagonist
was
out
he
left
a
note
informing
him
of
his
willingness
to
play
in
the
morrow
match
the
bell
rang
as
he
went
out
of
the
house
a
spot
of
rain
fell
on
his
hand
a
moment
later
there
was
a
continuous
patter
as
the
storm
which
had
been
gathering
all
day
broke
in
earnest
mike
turned
up
his
coat
collar
and
ran
back
to
outwood
at
this
rate
he
said
to
himself
there
wo
be
a
match
at
all
tomorrow
when
the
weather
decides
after
behaving
well
for
some
weeks
to
show
what
it
can
do
in
another
direction
it
does
the
thing
thoroughly
when
mike
woke
the
next
morning
the
world
was
gray
and
dripping
clouds
drifted
over
the
sky
till
there
was
not
a
trace
of
blue
to
be
seen
and
then
the
rain
began
again
in
the
gentle
determined
way
rain
has
when
it
means
to
make
a
day
of
it
it
was
one
of
those
bad
days
when
one
sits
in
the
pavilion
damp
and
depressed
while
figures
in
mackintoshes
with
discolored
buckskin
boots
crawl
miserably
about
the
field
in
couples
mike
shuffling
across
to
school
in
a
burberry
met
adair
at
gate
these
moments
are
always
difficult
mike
stopped
he
could
hardly
walk
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
looked
down
at
his
feet
coming
across
he
said
awkwardly
right
ho
said
adair
they
walked
on
in
silence
it
only
about
ten
to
is
it
said
mike
adair
fished
out
his
watch
and
examined
it
with
an
elaborate
care
born
of
nervousness
about
nine
to
good
we
got
plenty
of
time
yes
i
hate
having
to
hurry
over
to
school
so
do
i
i
often
do
cut
it
rather
fine
though
yes
so
do
i
beastly
nuisance
when
one
does
beastly
it
only
about
a
couple
of
minutes
from
the
houses
to
the
school
i
should
think
should
you
not
much
more
might
be
three
yes
three
if
one
did
hurry
another
silence
beastly
day
said
adair
rotten
silence
again
i
say
said
mike
scowling
at
his
toes
awfully
sorry
about
your
wrist
oh
that
all
right
it
was
my
fault
does
it
hurt
oh
no
rather
not
thanks
i
no
idea
you
crocked
yourself
oh
no
that
all
right
it
was
only
right
at
the
end
you
have
smashed
me
anyhow
oh
rot
i
bet
you
anything
you
like
you
would
i
bet
you
i
should
jolly
hard
luck
just
before
the
match
oh
no
i
say
thanks
awfully
for
saying
you
play
oh
rot
do
you
think
we
shall
get
a
game
adair
inspected
the
sky
carefully
i
do
know
it
looks
pretty
bad
does
it
rotten
i
say
how
long
will
your
wrist
keep
you
out
of
cricket
be
all
right
in
a
week
less
probably
good
now
that
you
and
smith
are
going
to
play
we
ought
to
have
a
jolly
good
season
rummy
smith
turning
out
to
be
a
cricketer
yes
i
should
think
he
be
a
hot
bowler
with
his
height
he
must
be
jolly
good
if
he
was
only
just
out
of
the
eton
team
last
year
yes
what
the
time
asked
mike
adair
produced
his
watch
once
more
five
to
we
heaps
of
time
yes
heaps
let
stroll
on
a
bit
down
the
road
shall
we
right
ho
mike
cleared
his
throat
i
say
hello
i
been
talking
to
smith
he
was
telling
me
that
you
thought
promised
to
give
stone
and
robinson
places
in
the
oh
no
that
all
right
it
was
only
for
a
bit
smith
told
me
you
could
have
done
and
i
saw
that
i
was
an
ass
to
think
you
could
have
it
was
stone
seeming
so
dead
certain
that
he
could
play
for
lower
borlock
if
i
chucked
him
from
the
school
team
that
gave
me
the
idea
he
never
even
asked
me
to
get
him
a
place
no
i
know
of
course
i
would
have
done
it
even
if
he
had
of
course
not
i
did
want
to
play
myself
but
i
was
going
to
do
a
rotten
trick
like
getting
other
fellows
away
from
the
team
no
i
know
it
was
rotten
enough
really
not
playing
myself
oh
no
beastly
rough
luck
having
to
leave
wrykyn
just
when
you
were
going
to
be
captain
and
come
to
a
small
school
like
this
the
excitement
of
the
past
few
days
must
have
had
a
stimulating
effect
on
mike
mind
shaken
it
up
as
it
were
for
now
for
the
second
time
in
two
days
he
displayed
quite
a
creditable
amount
of
intuition
he
might
have
been
misled
by
adair
apparently
deprecatory
attitude
toward
sedleigh
and
blundered
into
a
denunciation
of
the
place
adair
had
said
a
small
school
like
this
in
the
sort
of
voice
which
might
have
led
his
hearer
to
think
that
he
was
expected
to
say
yes
rotten
little
hole
is
it
or
words
to
that
effect
mike
fortunately
perceived
that
the
words
were
used
purely
from
politeness
on
the
chinese
principle
when
a
chinese
man
wishes
to
pay
a
compliment
he
does
so
by
belittling
himself
and
his
belongings
he
eluded
the
pitfall
what
rot
he
said
sedleigh
one
of
the
most
sporting
schools
ever
come
across
everybody
as
keen
as
blazes
so
they
ought
to
be
after
the
way
you
sweated
adair
shuffled
awkwardly
i
always
been
fairly
keen
on
the
place
he
said
but
i
suppose
i
done
anything
much
you
loosened
one
of
my
front
teeth
said
mike
with
a
grin
if
that
any
comfort
to
you
i
could
eat
anything
except
porridge
this
morning
my
jaw
still
aches
for
the
first
time
during
the
conversation
their
eyes
met
and
the
humorous
side
of
the
thing
struck
them
simultaneously
they
began
to
laugh
what
fools
we
must
have
looked
said
adair
were
all
right
i
must
have
looked
rotten
i
never
had
the
gloves
on
in
my
life
i
jolly
glad
no
one
saw
us
except
smith
who
does
count
hello
there
the
bell
we
better
be
moving
on
what
about
this
match
not
much
chance
of
it
from
the
look
of
the
sky
at
present
it
might
clear
before
eleven
you
better
get
changed
anyhow
at
the
interval
and
hang
about
in
case
all
right
it
better
than
doing
thucydides
with
downing
we
got
math
till
the
interval
so
i
do
see
anything
of
him
all
day
which
wo
hurt
me
he
is
a
bad
sort
of
chap
when
you
get
to
know
him
said
adair
i
ca
have
done
then
i
do
know
which
i
least
soon
be
downing
or
a
black
beetle
except
that
if
one
was
downing
one
could
tread
on
the
black
beetle
dash
this
rain
i
got
about
half
a
pint
down
my
neck
just
then
we
sha
get
a
game
today
or
anything
like
it
as
crocked
i
not
sure
that
i
care
much
you
been
sweating
for
years
to
get
the
match
on
and
it
would
be
rather
rot
playing
it
without
you
i
do
know
that
so
much
i
wish
we
could
play
because
i
certain
with
you
and
smith
we
walk
into
them
they
probably
are
sending
down
much
of
a
team
and
really
now
that
you
and
smith
are
turning
out
we
got
a
jolly
hot
lot
there
quite
decent
batting
all
the
way
through
and
the
bowling
is
so
bad
if
only
we
could
have
given
this
lot
a
really
good
hammering
it
might
have
been
easier
to
get
some
good
fixtures
for
next
season
you
see
it
all
right
for
a
school
like
wrykyn
but
with
a
small
place
like
this
you
simply
ca
get
the
best
teams
to
give
you
a
match
till
you
done
something
to
show
that
you
are
absolute
rotters
at
the
game
as
for
the
schools
worse
they
simply
laugh
at
you
you
were
cricket
secretary
at
wrykyn
last
year
what
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
a
challenge
from
sedleigh
you
either
have
laughed
till
you
were
sick
or
else
had
a
fit
at
the
mere
idea
of
the
thing
mike
stopped
by
jove
you
struck
about
the
brightest
scheme
on
record
i
never
thought
of
it
before
let
get
a
match
on
with
wrykyn
what
they
would
play
us
yes
they
would
at
least
i
pretty
sure
they
would
i
had
a
letter
from
strachan
the
captain
yesterday
saying
that
the
ripton
match
had
had
to
be
scratched
owing
to
illness
so
they
got
a
vacant
date
shall
i
try
them
i
write
to
strachan
tonight
if
you
like
and
they
are
strong
this
year
we
smash
them
what
do
you
say
adair
was
as
one
who
has
seen
a
vision
by
jove
he
said
at
last
if
we
only
could
mr
downing
moves
the
rain
continued
without
a
break
all
the
morning
the
two
teams
after
hanging
about
dismally
and
whiling
the
time
away
with
in
the
changing
rooms
lunched
in
the
pavilion
at
one
after
which
the
captain
approaching
adair
moved
that
this
merry
meeting
be
considered
off
and
he
and
his
men
permitted
to
catch
the
next
train
back
to
town
to
which
adair
seeing
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
there
should
be
any
cricket
that
afternoon
regretfully
agreed
and
the
first
sedleigh
match
was
accordingly
scratched
mike
and
psmith
wandering
back
to
the
house
were
met
by
a
damp
junior
from
downing
with
a
message
that
mr
downing
wished
to
see
mike
as
soon
as
he
was
changed
what
he
want
me
for
inquired
mike
the
messenger
did
not
know
mr
downing
it
seemed
had
not
confided
in
him
all
he
knew
was
that
the
housemaster
was
in
the
house
and
would
be
glad
if
mike
would
step
across
a
nuisance
said
psmith
this
incessant
demand
for
you
that
the
worst
of
being
popular
if
he
wants
you
to
stop
to
tea
edge
away
a
meal
on
rather
a
sumptuous
scale
will
be
prepared
in
the
study
against
your
return
mike
changed
quickly
and
went
off
leaving
psmith
who
was
fond
of
simple
pleasures
in
his
spare
time
earnestly
occupied
with
a
puzzle
which
had
been
scattered
through
the
land
by
a
weekly
paper
the
prize
for
a
solution
was
one
thousand
pounds
and
psmith
had
already
informed
mike
with
some
minuteness
of
his
plans
for
the
disposition
of
this
sum
meanwhile
he
worked
at
it
both
in
and
out
of
school
generally
with
abusive
comments
on
its
inventor
he
was
still
fiddling
away
at
it
when
mike
returned
mike
though
psmith
was
at
first
too
absorbed
to
notice
it
was
agitated
i
do
wish
to
be
in
any
way
harsh
said
psmith
without
looking
up
but
the
man
who
invented
this
thing
was
a
blighter
of
the
worst
type
you
come
and
have
a
shot
for
the
moment
i
am
baffled
the
whisper
flies
round
the
clubs
is
baffled
the
man
an
absolute
driveling
ass
said
mike
warmly
me
do
you
mean
what
on
earth
would
be
the
point
of
my
doing
it
you
gather
in
a
thousand
of
the
best
give
you
a
nice
start
in
life
i
not
talking
about
your
rotten
puzzle
what
you
talking
about
that
ass
downing
i
believe
he
off
his
nut
then
your
chat
with
comrade
downing
was
not
of
the
type
what
has
he
been
doing
to
you
he
off
his
nut
i
know
but
what
did
he
do
how
did
the
brainstorm
burst
did
he
jump
at
you
from
behind
a
door
and
bite
a
piece
out
of
your
leg
or
did
he
say
he
was
a
teapot
mike
sat
down
you
remember
that
business
as
if
it
were
yesterday
said
psmith
which
it
was
pretty
nearly
he
thinks
i
did
it
why
have
you
ever
shown
any
talent
in
the
painting
line
the
silly
ass
wanted
me
to
confess
that
i
done
it
he
as
good
as
asked
me
to
jawed
a
lot
of
rot
about
my
finding
it
to
my
advantage
later
on
if
i
behaved
sensibly
then
what
are
you
worrying
about
do
you
know
that
when
a
master
wants
you
to
do
the
confessing
act
it
simply
means
that
he
enough
evidence
to
start
in
on
you
with
you
all
right
the
thing
a
evidence
said
mike
my
dear
man
he
got
enough
evidence
to
sink
a
ship
he
absolutely
sweating
evidence
at
every
pore
as
far
as
i
can
see
he
been
crawling
about
doing
the
sherlock
holmes
business
for
all
he
worth
ever
since
the
thing
happened
and
now
he
dead
certain
that
i
painted
sammy
you
by
the
way
said
psmith
no
said
mike
shortly
i
did
but
after
listening
to
downing
i
almost
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
the
man
got
stacks
of
evidence
to
prove
that
i
did
such
as
what
it
mostly
about
my
shoes
but
dash
it
you
know
all
about
that
why
you
were
with
him
when
he
came
and
looked
for
them
it
is
true
said
psmith
that
comrade
downing
and
i
spent
a
very
pleasant
half
hour
together
inspecting
shoes
but
how
does
he
drag
you
into
it
he
swears
one
of
the
shoes
was
splashed
with
paint
yes
he
babbled
to
some
extent
on
that
point
when
i
was
entertaining
him
but
what
makes
him
think
that
the
shoe
if
any
was
yours
he
certain
that
somebody
in
this
house
got
one
of
his
shoes
splashed
and
is
hiding
it
somewhere
and
i
the
only
chap
in
the
house
who
has
got
a
pair
of
shoes
to
show
so
he
thinks
it
me
i
do
know
where
the
dickens
my
other
shoe
has
gone
of
course
i
got
two
pairs
but
one
being
soled
so
i
had
to
go
over
to
school
yesterday
in
gym
shoes
that
how
he
spotted
me
psmith
sighed
comrade
jackson
he
said
mournfully
all
this
very
sad
affair
shows
the
folly
of
acting
from
the
best
motives
in
my
simple
zeal
meaning
to
save
you
unpleasantness
i
have
landed
you
with
a
dull
sickening
thud
right
in
the
cart
are
you
particular
about
dirtying
your
hands
if
you
are
just
reach
up
that
chimney
a
bit
mike
stared
what
the
dickens
are
you
talking
about
go
on
get
it
over
be
a
man
and
reach
up
the
chimney
i
do
know
what
the
game
is
said
mike
kneeling
beside
the
fender
and
groping
but
ah
ha
said
psmith
moodily
mike
dropped
the
object
in
the
fender
and
glared
at
it
it
my
shoe
he
said
at
last
it
said
psmith
your
shoe
and
what
is
that
red
stain
across
the
toe
is
it
blood
no
is
not
blood
it
is
red
paint
mike
seemed
unable
to
remove
his
eyes
from
the
shoe
how
on
earth
did
by
jove
i
remember
now
i
kicked
up
against
something
in
the
dark
when
i
was
putting
my
bicycle
back
that
night
it
must
have
been
the
paint
pot
then
you
were
out
that
night
rather
that
what
makes
it
so
jolly
awkward
it
too
long
to
tell
you
now
your
stories
are
never
too
long
for
me
said
psmith
say
on
well
it
was
like
this
and
mike
related
the
events
which
had
led
up
to
his
midnight
excursion
psmith
listened
attentively
this
he
said
when
mike
had
finished
confirms
my
frequently
stated
opinion
that
comrade
jellicoe
is
one
of
nature
blitherers
so
why
he
touched
us
for
our
was
it
yes
of
course
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
have
the
money
at
all
and
the
result
is
that
you
are
in
something
of
a
tight
place
certain
you
did
paint
that
dog
did
do
it
by
any
chance
in
a
moment
of
and
forgot
all
about
it
no
no
i
suppose
not
i
wonder
who
did
it
beastly
awkward
you
see
downing
chased
me
that
night
that
was
why
i
rang
the
alarm
bell
so
you
see
he
certain
to
think
that
the
chap
he
chased
which
was
me
and
the
chap
who
painted
sammy
are
the
same
i
shall
get
landed
both
ways
psmith
pondered
it
a
tightish
place
he
admitted
i
wonder
if
we
could
get
this
shoe
clean
said
mike
inspecting
it
with
disfavor
not
for
a
pretty
considerable
time
i
suppose
not
i
say
i
in
the
cart
if
i
ca
produce
this
shoe
they
bound
to
guess
why
what
exactly
asked
psmith
was
the
position
of
affairs
between
you
and
comrade
downing
when
you
left
him
had
you
definitely
parted
brass
rags
or
did
you
simply
sort
of
drift
apart
with
mutual
courtesies
oh
he
said
i
was
ill
advised
to
continue
that
attitude
or
some
rot
and
i
said
i
did
care
i
had
painted
his
bally
dog
and
he
said
very
well
then
he
must
take
steps
and
well
that
was
about
all
sufficient
too
said
psmith
quite
sufficient
i
take
it
then
that
he
is
now
on
the
warpath
collecting
a
gang
so
to
speak
i
suppose
he
gone
to
the
old
man
about
it
probably
a
very
worrying
time
our
headmaster
is
having
taking
it
all
round
in
connection
with
this
painful
affair
what
do
you
think
his
move
will
be
i
suppose
he
send
for
me
and
try
to
get
something
out
of
me
want
you
to
confess
too
masters
are
all
whales
on
confession
the
worst
of
it
is
you
ca
prove
an
alibi
because
at
about
the
time
the
foul
act
was
perpetrated
you
were
playing
with
comrade
downing
this
needs
thought
you
had
better
put
the
case
in
my
hands
and
go
out
and
watch
the
dandelions
growing
i
will
think
over
the
matter
well
i
hope
you
be
able
to
think
of
something
i
ca
possibly
you
never
know
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
see
how
we
have
trained
them
said
psmith
they
now
knock
before
entering
there
was
a
time
when
they
would
have
tried
to
smash
in
a
panel
come
in
a
small
boy
carrying
a
straw
hat
adorned
with
the
school
house
ribbon
answered
the
invitation
oh
i
say
jackson
he
said
the
headmaster
sent
me
over
to
tell
you
he
wants
to
see
you
i
told
you
so
said
mike
to
psmith
do
go
suggested
psmith
tell
him
to
write
mike
got
up
all
this
is
very
trying
said
psmith
i
seeing
nothing
of
you
today
he
turned
to
the
small
boy
tell
willie
he
added
that
jackson
will
be
with
him
in
a
moment
the
emissary
departed
all
right
said
psmith
encouragingly
just
you
keep
on
saying
you
all
right
stout
denial
is
the
thing
do
go
in
for
any
airy
explanations
simply
stick
to
stout
denial
you
ca
beat
it
with
which
expert
advice
he
allowed
mike
to
go
on
his
way
he
had
not
been
gone
two
minutes
when
psmith
who
had
leaned
back
in
his
chair
rapt
in
thought
heaved
himself
up
again
he
stood
for
a
moment
straightening
his
tie
at
the
looking
glass
then
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
moved
slowly
out
of
the
door
and
down
the
passage
thence
at
the
same
dignified
rate
of
progress
out
of
the
house
and
in
at
downing
front
gate
the
postman
was
at
the
door
when
he
got
there
apparently
absorbed
in
conversation
with
the
parlor
maid
psmith
stood
by
politely
till
the
postman
who
had
just
been
told
it
was
like
his
impudence
caught
sight
of
him
and
having
handed
over
the
letters
in
an
ultraformal
and
professional
manner
passed
away
is
mr
downing
at
home
inquired
psmith
he
was
it
seemed
psmith
was
shown
into
the
dining
room
on
the
left
of
the
hall
and
requested
to
wait
he
was
examining
a
portrait
of
mr
downing
which
hung
on
the
wall
when
the
housemaster
came
in
an
excellent
likeness
sir
said
psmith
with
a
gesture
of
the
hand
toward
the
painting
well
smith
said
mr
downing
shortly
what
do
you
wish
to
see
me
about
it
was
in
connection
with
the
regrettable
painting
of
your
dog
sir
ha
said
mr
downing
i
did
it
sir
said
psmith
stopping
and
flicking
a
piece
of
fluff
off
his
knee
the
artist
claims
his
work
the
line
of
action
which
psmith
had
called
stout
denial
is
an
excellent
line
to
adopt
especially
if
you
really
are
innocent
but
it
does
not
lead
to
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
bright
and
snappy
dialogue
between
accuser
and
accused
both
mike
and
the
headmaster
were
oppressed
by
a
feeling
that
the
situation
was
difficult
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
and
conversation
showed
a
tendency
to
flag
the
headmaster
had
opened
brightly
enough
with
a
summary
of
the
evidence
which
mr
downing
had
laid
before
him
but
after
that
a
massive
silence
had
been
the
order
of
the
day
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
quite
so
stolid
and
uncommunicative
as
a
boy
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
be
stolid
and
uncommunicative
and
the
headmaster
as
he
sat
and
looked
at
mike
who
sat
and
looked
past
him
at
the
bookshelves
felt
awkward
it
was
a
scene
which
needed
either
a
dramatic
interruption
or
a
neat
exit
speech
as
it
happened
what
it
got
was
the
dramatic
interruption
the
headmaster
was
just
saying
i
do
not
think
you
fully
realize
jackson
the
extent
to
which
appearances
which
was
practically
going
back
to
the
beginning
and
starting
again
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
a
voice
without
said
mr
downing
to
see
you
sir
and
the
chief
witness
for
the
prosecution
burst
in
i
would
not
have
interrupted
you
said
mr
downing
but
not
at
all
mr
downing
is
there
anything
i
can
i
have
discovered
i
have
been
informed
in
short
it
was
not
jackson
who
committed
the
who
painted
my
dog
mike
and
the
headmaster
both
looked
at
the
speaker
mike
with
a
feeling
of
relief
for
stout
denial
unsupported
by
any
weighty
evidence
is
a
wearing
game
to
play
the
headmaster
with
astonishment
not
jackson
said
the
headmaster
no
it
was
a
boy
in
the
same
house
smith
psmith
mike
was
more
than
surprised
he
could
not
believe
it
there
is
nothing
which
affords
so
clear
an
index
to
a
boy
character
as
the
type
of
rag
which
he
considers
humorous
between
what
is
a
rag
and
what
is
merely
a
rotten
trick
there
is
a
very
definite
line
drawn
masters
as
a
rule
do
not
realize
this
but
boys
nearly
always
do
mike
could
not
imagine
psmith
doing
a
rotten
thing
like
covering
a
housemaster
dog
with
red
paint
any
more
than
he
could
imagine
doing
it
himself
they
had
both
been
amused
at
the
sight
of
sammy
after
the
operation
but
anybody
except
possibly
the
owner
of
the
dog
would
have
thought
it
funny
at
first
after
the
first
surprise
their
feeling
had
been
that
it
was
a
rotten
thing
to
have
done
and
beastly
rough
luck
on
the
poor
brute
it
was
a
kid
trick
as
for
psmith
having
done
it
mike
simply
did
not
believe
it
smith
said
the
headmaster
what
makes
you
think
that
simply
this
said
mr
downing
with
calm
triumph
that
the
boy
himself
came
to
me
a
few
moments
ago
and
confessed
mike
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
acute
depression
it
did
not
make
him
in
the
least
degree
jubilant
or
even
thankful
to
know
that
he
himself
was
cleared
of
the
charge
all
he
could
think
of
was
that
psmith
was
done
for
this
was
bound
to
mean
the
sack
if
psmith
had
painted
sammy
it
meant
that
psmith
had
broken
out
of
his
house
at
night
and
it
was
not
likely
that
the
rules
about
nocturnal
wandering
were
less
strict
at
sedleigh
than
at
any
other
school
in
the
kingdom
mike
felt
if
possible
worse
than
he
had
felt
when
wyatt
had
been
caught
on
a
similar
occasion
it
seemed
as
if
fate
had
a
special
grudge
against
his
best
friends
he
did
not
make
friends
very
quickly
or
easily
though
he
had
always
had
scores
of
acquaintances
and
with
wyatt
and
psmith
he
had
found
himself
at
home
from
the
first
moment
he
had
met
them
he
sat
there
with
a
curious
feeling
of
having
swallowed
a
heavy
weight
hardly
listening
to
what
mr
downing
was
saying
mr
downing
was
talking
rapidly
to
the
headmaster
who
was
nodding
from
time
to
time
mike
took
advantage
of
a
pause
to
get
up
may
i
go
sir
he
said
certainly
jackson
certainly
said
the
head
oh
and
er
if
you
are
going
back
to
your
house
tell
smith
that
i
should
like
to
see
him
yes
sir
he
had
reached
the
door
when
again
there
was
a
knock
come
in
said
the
headmaster
it
was
adair
yes
adair
adair
was
breathing
rather
heavily
as
if
he
had
been
running
it
was
about
sammy
sampson
sir
he
said
looking
at
mr
downing
ah
we
know
well
adair
what
did
you
wish
to
say
it
was
jackson
who
did
it
sir
no
no
adair
so
mr
downing
it
was
dunster
sir
terrific
sensation
the
headmaster
gave
a
sort
of
strangled
yelp
of
astonishment
mr
downing
leaped
in
his
chair
mike
eyes
opened
to
their
fullest
extent
adair
there
was
almost
a
wail
in
the
headmaster
voice
the
situation
had
suddenly
become
too
much
for
him
his
brain
was
swimming
that
mike
despite
the
evidence
against
him
should
be
innocent
was
curious
perhaps
but
not
particularly
startling
but
that
adair
should
inform
him
two
minutes
after
mr
downing
announcement
of
confession
that
psmith
too
was
guiltless
and
that
the
real
criminal
was
dunster
it
was
this
that
made
him
feel
that
somebody
in
the
words
of
an
american
author
had
played
a
mean
trick
on
him
and
substituted
for
his
brain
a
side
order
of
cauliflower
why
dunster
of
all
people
dunster
who
he
remembered
dizzily
had
left
the
school
at
christmas
and
why
if
dunster
had
really
painted
the
dog
had
psmith
asserted
that
he
himself
was
the
culprit
why
why
anything
he
concentrated
his
mind
on
adair
as
the
only
person
who
could
save
him
from
impending
brain
fever
adair
yes
sir
what
do
you
mean
it
dunster
sir
i
got
a
letter
from
him
only
five
minutes
ago
in
which
he
said
that
he
had
painted
sammy
sampson
the
dog
sir
for
a
rag
for
a
joke
and
that
as
he
did
want
anyone
here
to
get
into
a
row
be
punished
for
it
i
better
tell
mr
downing
at
once
i
tried
to
find
mr
downing
but
he
was
in
the
house
then
i
met
smith
outside
the
house
and
he
told
me
that
mr
downing
had
gone
over
to
see
you
sir
smith
told
you
said
mr
downing
yes
sir
did
you
say
anything
to
him
about
your
having
received
this
letter
from
dunster
i
gave
him
the
letter
to
read
sir
and
what
was
his
attitude
when
he
had
read
it
he
laughed
sir
mr
downing
voice
was
thunderous
yes
sir
he
rolled
about
mr
downing
snorted
but
adair
said
the
headmaster
i
do
not
understand
how
this
thing
could
have
been
done
by
dunster
he
has
left
the
school
he
was
down
here
for
the
old
sedleighans
match
sir
he
stopped
the
night
in
the
village
and
that
was
the
night
the
it
happened
yes
sir
i
see
well
i
am
glad
to
find
that
the
blame
can
not
be
attached
to
any
boy
in
the
school
i
am
sorry
that
it
is
even
an
old
boy
it
was
a
foolish
discreditable
thing
to
have
done
but
it
is
not
as
bad
as
if
any
boy
still
at
the
school
had
broken
out
of
his
house
at
night
to
do
it
the
sergeant
said
mr
downing
told
me
that
the
boy
he
saw
was
attempting
to
enter
outwood
house
another
freak
of
dunster
i
suppose
said
the
headmaster
i
shall
write
to
him
if
it
was
really
dunster
who
painted
my
dog
said
mr
downing
i
can
not
understand
the
part
played
by
smith
in
this
affair
if
he
did
not
do
it
what
possible
motive
could
he
have
had
for
coming
to
me
of
his
own
accord
and
deliberately
confessing
to
be
sure
said
the
headmaster
pressing
a
bell
it
is
certainly
a
thing
that
calls
for
explanation
barlow
he
said
as
the
butler
appeared
kindly
go
across
to
outwood
house
and
inform
smith
that
i
should
like
to
see
him
if
you
please
sir
smith
is
waiting
in
the
hall
in
the
hall
yes
sir
he
arrived
soon
after
adair
sir
saying
that
he
would
wait
as
you
would
probably
wish
to
see
him
shortly
h
ask
him
to
step
up
barlow
yes
sir
there
followed
one
of
the
tensest
stage
waits
of
mike
experience
it
was
not
long
but
while
it
lasted
the
silence
was
quite
solid
nobody
seemed
to
have
anything
to
say
and
there
was
not
even
a
clock
in
the
room
to
break
the
stillness
with
its
ticking
a
very
faint
of
rain
could
be
heard
outside
the
window
presently
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
the
door
was
opened
smith
sir
the
old
etonian
entered
as
would
the
guest
of
the
evening
who
is
a
few
moments
late
for
dinner
he
was
cheerful
but
slightly
deprecating
he
gave
the
impression
of
one
who
though
sure
of
his
welcome
feels
that
some
slight
apology
is
expected
from
him
he
advanced
into
the
room
with
a
gentle
which
suggested
good
will
to
all
men
it
is
still
raining
he
observed
you
wished
to
see
me
sir
sit
down
smith
thank
you
sir
he
dropped
into
a
deep
armchair
which
both
adair
and
mike
had
avoided
in
favor
of
less
luxurious
seats
with
the
confidential
cosiness
of
a
fashionable
physician
calling
on
a
patient
between
whom
and
himself
time
has
broken
down
the
barriers
of
restraint
and
formality
mr
downing
burst
out
like
a
reservoir
that
has
broken
its
banks
smith
psmith
turned
his
gaze
politely
in
the
housemaster
direction
smith
you
came
to
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
and
told
me
that
it
was
you
who
had
painted
my
dog
sampson
yes
sir
it
was
absolutely
untrue
i
am
afraid
so
sir
but
smith
began
the
headmaster
psmith
bent
forward
encouragingly
this
is
a
most
extraordinary
affair
have
you
no
explanation
to
offer
what
induced
you
to
do
such
a
thing
psmith
sighed
softly
the
craze
of
notoriety
sir
he
replied
sadly
the
curse
of
the
present
age
what
replied
the
headmaster
it
is
remarkable
proceeded
psmith
placidly
with
the
impersonal
touch
of
one
lecturing
on
generalities
how
frequently
when
a
murder
has
been
committed
one
finds
men
confessing
that
they
have
done
it
when
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
they
should
have
committed
it
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
problems
with
which
anthropologists
are
confronted
human
nature
the
headmaster
interrupted
smith
he
said
i
should
like
to
see
you
alone
for
a
moment
mr
downing
might
i
trouble
adair
jackson
he
made
a
motion
toward
the
door
when
he
and
psmith
were
alone
there
was
silence
psmith
leaned
back
comfortably
in
his
chair
the
headmaster
tapped
nervously
with
his
foot
on
the
floor
er
smith
sir
the
headmaster
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
proceeding
he
paused
again
then
he
went
on
er
smith
i
do
not
for
a
moment
wish
to
pain
you
but
have
you
er
do
you
remember
ever
having
had
as
a
child
let
us
say
any
er
severe
illness
any
er
illness
no
sir
there
is
no
forgive
me
if
i
am
touching
on
a
sad
subject
there
is
no
none
of
your
near
relatives
have
ever
suffered
in
the
way
i
er
have
described
there
is
a
lunatic
on
the
list
sir
said
psmith
cheerfully
of
course
smith
of
course
said
the
headmaster
hurriedly
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
quite
so
quite
so
you
think
then
that
you
confessed
to
an
act
which
you
had
not
committed
purely
from
some
sudden
impulse
which
you
can
not
explain
strictly
between
ourselves
sir
privately
the
headmaster
found
psmith
attitude
somewhat
disconcerting
but
he
said
nothing
well
smith
i
should
not
like
it
to
go
any
further
sir
i
will
certainly
respect
any
confidence
i
do
want
anybody
to
know
sir
this
is
strictly
between
ourselves
i
think
you
are
sometimes
apt
to
forget
smith
the
proper
relations
existing
between
boy
and
well
never
mind
that
for
the
present
we
can
return
to
it
later
for
the
moment
let
me
hear
what
you
wish
to
say
i
shall
of
course
tell
nobody
if
you
do
not
wish
it
well
it
was
like
this
sir
said
psmith
jackson
happened
to
tell
me
that
you
and
mr
downing
seemed
to
think
he
had
painted
mr
dog
and
there
seemed
some
danger
of
his
being
expelled
so
i
thought
it
would
be
an
unsound
scheme
if
i
were
to
go
and
say
i
had
done
it
that
was
the
whole
thing
of
course
dunster
writing
created
a
certain
amount
of
confusion
there
was
a
pause
it
was
a
very
wrong
thing
to
do
smith
said
the
headmaster
at
last
but
you
are
a
curious
boy
smith
good
night
he
held
out
his
hand
good
night
sir
said
psmith
not
a
bad
old
sort
said
psmith
meditatively
to
himself
as
he
walked
downstairs
by
no
means
a
bad
old
sort
i
must
drop
in
from
time
to
time
and
cultivate
him
mike
and
adair
were
waiting
for
him
outside
the
front
door
well
said
mike
you
the
limit
said
adair
what
he
done
nothing
we
had
a
very
pleasant
chat
and
then
i
tore
myself
away
do
you
mean
to
say
he
not
going
to
do
a
thing
not
a
thing
well
you
a
marvel
said
adair
psmith
thanked
him
courteously
they
walked
on
toward
the
houses
by
the
way
adair
said
mike
as
the
latter
started
to
turn
in
at
downing
i
write
to
strachan
tonight
about
that
match
what
that
asked
psmith
jackson
going
to
try
and
get
wrykyn
to
give
us
a
game
said
adair
they
got
a
vacant
date
i
hope
the
dickens
they
do
it
oh
i
should
think
they
certain
to
said
mike
good
night
and
give
comrade
downing
when
you
see
him
said
psmith
my
very
best
love
it
is
men
like
him
who
make
this
merrie
england
of
ours
what
it
is
i
say
psmith
said
mike
suddenly
what
really
made
you
tell
downing
you
done
it
the
craving
for
oh
chuck
it
you
are
talking
to
the
old
man
now
i
believe
it
was
simply
to
get
me
out
of
a
jolly
tight
corner
psmith
expression
was
one
of
pain
my
dear
comrade
jackson
said
he
you
wrong
me
you
make
me
writhe
i
surprised
at
you
i
never
thought
to
hear
those
words
from
michael
jackson
well
i
believe
you
did
all
the
same
said
mike
obstinately
and
it
was
jolly
good
of
you
too
psmith
moaned
sedleigh
wrykyn
the
wrykyn
match
was
three
parts
over
and
things
were
going
badly
for
sedleigh
in
a
way
one
might
have
said
that
the
game
was
over
and
that
sedleigh
had
lost
for
it
was
a
match
and
wrykyn
who
had
led
on
the
first
innings
had
only
to
play
out
time
to
make
the
game
theirs
sedleigh
were
paying
the
penalty
for
allowing
themselves
to
be
influenced
by
nerves
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
nerves
lose
more
school
matches
than
good
play
ever
won
there
is
a
certain
type
of
school
batsman
who
is
a
gift
to
any
bowler
when
he
once
lets
his
imagination
run
away
with
him
sedleigh
with
the
exception
of
adair
psmith
and
mike
had
entered
upon
this
match
in
a
state
of
the
most
azure
funk
ever
since
mike
had
received
strachan
answer
and
adair
had
announced
on
the
notice
board
that
on
saturday
july
the
twentieth
sedleigh
would
play
wrykyn
the
team
had
been
all
on
the
jump
it
was
useless
for
adair
to
tell
them
as
he
did
repeatedly
on
authority
that
wrykyn
were
weak
this
season
and
that
on
their
present
form
sedleigh
ought
to
win
easily
the
team
listened
but
were
not
comforted
wrykyn
might
be
below
their
usual
strength
but
then
wrykyn
cricket
as
a
rule
reached
such
a
high
standard
that
this
probably
meant
little
however
weak
wrykyn
might
be
for
them
there
was
a
very
firm
impression
among
the
members
of
the
sedleigh
first
eleven
that
the
other
school
was
quite
strong
enough
to
knock
the
cover
off
experience
counts
enormously
in
school
matches
sedleigh
had
never
been
proved
the
teams
they
played
were
the
sort
of
sides
which
the
wrykyn
second
eleven
would
play
whereas
wrykyn
from
time
immemorial
had
been
beating
ripton
teams
and
free
foresters
teams
and
teams
packed
with
county
men
and
sending
men
to
oxford
and
cambridge
who
got
their
blues
as
freshmen
sedleigh
had
gone
onto
the
field
that
morning
a
depressed
side
it
was
unfortunate
that
adair
had
won
the
toss
he
had
had
no
choice
but
to
take
first
innings
the
weather
had
been
bad
for
the
last
week
and
the
wicket
was
slow
and
treacherous
it
was
likely
to
get
worse
during
the
day
so
adair
had
chosen
to
bat
first
taking
into
consideration
the
state
of
nerves
the
team
was
in
this
in
itself
was
a
calamity
a
school
eleven
are
always
at
their
worst
and
nerviest
before
lunch
even
on
their
own
ground
they
find
the
surroundings
lonely
and
unfamiliar
the
subtlety
of
the
bowlers
becomes
magnified
unless
the
first
pair
make
a
really
good
start
a
collapse
almost
invariably
ensues
today
the
start
had
been
gruesome
beyond
words
mike
the
bulwark
of
the
side
the
man
who
had
been
brought
up
on
wrykyn
bowling
and
from
whom
whatever
might
happen
to
the
others
at
least
a
fifty
was
expected
mike
going
in
first
with
barnes
and
taking
first
over
had
played
inside
one
from
bruce
the
wrykyn
slow
bowler
and
had
been
caught
at
short
slip
off
his
second
ball
that
put
the
finishing
touch
on
the
panic
stone
robinson
and
the
others
all
quite
decent
punishing
batsmen
when
their
nerves
allowed
them
to
play
their
own
game
crawled
to
the
wickets
declined
to
hit
out
at
anything
and
were
clean
bowled
several
of
them
playing
back
to
half
volleys
adair
did
not
suffer
from
panic
but
his
batting
was
not
equal
to
his
bowling
and
he
had
fallen
after
hitting
one
four
seven
wickets
were
down
for
thirty
when
psmith
went
in
psmith
had
always
disclaimed
any
pretensions
to
batting
skill
but
he
was
undoubtedly
the
right
man
for
a
crisis
like
this
he
had
an
enormous
reach
and
he
used
it
three
consecutive
balls
from
bruce
he
turned
into
full
tosses
and
swept
to
the
leg
boundary
and
assisted
by
barnes
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
splice
in
his
usual
manner
he
raised
the
total
to
before
being
yorked
with
his
score
at
ten
minutes
later
the
innings
was
over
with
barnes
not
out
sixteen
for
wrykyn
had
then
gone
in
lost
strachan
for
twenty
before
lunch
and
finally
completed
their
innings
at
a
quarter
to
four
for
a
hundred
and
this
was
better
than
sedleigh
had
expected
at
least
eight
of
the
team
had
looked
forward
dismally
to
an
afternoon
leather
hunting
but
adair
and
psmith
helped
by
the
wicket
had
never
been
easy
especially
psmith
who
had
taken
six
wickets
his
slows
playing
havoc
with
the
tail
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
sedleigh
had
any
hope
of
pulling
the
game
out
of
the
fire
but
it
was
a
comfort
they
felt
at
any
rate
having
another
knock
as
is
usual
at
this
stage
of
a
match
their
nervousness
had
vanished
and
they
felt
capable
of
better
things
than
in
the
first
innings
it
was
on
mike
suggestion
that
psmith
and
he
went
in
first
mike
knew
the
limitations
of
the
wrykyn
bowling
and
he
was
convinced
that
if
they
could
knock
bruce
off
it
might
be
possible
to
rattle
up
a
score
sufficient
to
give
them
the
game
always
provided
wrykyn
collapsed
in
the
second
innings
and
it
seemed
to
mike
that
the
wicket
would
be
so
bad
then
that
they
easily
might
so
he
and
psmith
had
gone
in
at
four
to
hit
and
they
had
hit
the
deficit
had
been
wiped
off
all
but
a
dozen
runs
when
psmith
was
bowled
and
by
that
time
mike
was
set
and
in
his
best
vein
he
treated
all
the
bowlers
alike
and
when
stone
came
in
restored
to
his
proper
frame
of
mind
and
lashed
out
stoutly
and
after
him
robinson
and
the
rest
it
looked
as
if
sedleigh
had
a
chance
again
the
score
was
a
hundred
and
twenty
when
mike
who
had
just
reached
his
fifty
skied
one
to
strachan
at
cover
the
time
was
past
five
as
mike
reached
the
pavilion
adair
declared
the
innings
closed
wrykyn
started
batting
at
minutes
to
six
with
to
make
if
they
wished
to
make
them
and
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
during
which
to
keep
up
their
wickets
if
they
preferred
to
take
things
easy
and
go
for
a
win
on
the
first
innings
at
first
it
looked
as
if
they
meant
to
knock
off
the
runs
for
strachan
forced
the
game
from
the
first
ball
which
was
psmith
and
which
he
hit
into
the
pavilion
but
at
fifteen
adair
bowled
him
and
when
two
runs
later
psmith
got
the
next
man
stumped
and
finished
up
his
over
with
a
wrykyn
decided
that
it
was
not
good
enough
seventeen
for
three
with
an
hour
all
but
five
minutes
to
go
was
getting
too
dangerous
so
drummond
and
rigby
the
next
pair
proceeded
to
play
with
caution
and
the
collapse
ceased
this
was
the
state
of
the
game
at
the
point
at
which
this
chapter
opened
seventeen
for
three
had
become
for
three
and
the
hands
of
the
clock
stood
at
ten
minutes
past
six
changes
of
bowling
had
been
tried
but
there
seemed
no
chance
of
getting
past
the
defence
they
were
playing
all
the
good
balls
and
refused
to
hit
at
the
bad
a
quarter
past
six
struck
and
then
psmith
made
a
suggestion
which
altered
the
game
completely
why
do
you
have
a
shot
this
end
he
said
to
adair
as
they
were
crossing
over
there
a
spot
on
the
off
which
might
help
you
a
lot
you
can
break
like
blazes
if
only
you
land
on
it
it
does
help
my
leg
breaks
a
bit
because
they
wo
hit
at
them
barnes
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
to
bowl
when
adair
took
the
ball
from
him
the
captain
of
outwood
retired
to
short
leg
with
an
air
that
suggested
that
he
was
glad
to
be
relieved
of
his
prominent
post
the
next
moment
drummond
off
stump
was
lying
at
an
angle
of
adair
was
absolutely
accurate
as
a
bowler
and
he
had
dropped
his
first
ball
right
on
the
worn
patch
two
minutes
later
drummond
successor
was
retiring
to
the
pavilion
while
the
wicket
keeper
straightened
the
stumps
again
there
is
nothing
like
a
couple
of
unexpected
wickets
for
altering
the
atmosphere
of
a
game
five
minutes
before
sedleigh
had
been
lethargic
and
without
hope
now
there
was
a
stir
and
buzz
all
around
the
ground
there
were
minutes
to
go
and
five
wickets
were
down
sedleigh
was
on
top
again
the
next
man
seemed
to
take
an
age
coming
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
walked
more
rapidly
than
a
batsman
usually
walks
to
the
crease
adair
third
ball
dropped
just
short
of
the
spot
the
batsman
hitting
out
was
a
shade
too
soon
the
ball
hummed
through
the
air
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
ground
in
the
direction
of
mid
off
and
mike
diving
to
the
right
got
to
it
as
he
was
falling
and
chucked
it
up
after
that
the
thing
was
a
walk
over
psmith
clean
bowled
a
man
in
his
next
over
and
the
tail
demoralized
by
the
sudden
change
in
the
game
collapsed
uncompromisingly
sedleigh
won
by
runs
with
eight
minutes
in
hand
psmith
and
mike
sat
in
their
study
after
lockup
discussing
things
in
general
and
the
game
in
particular
i
feel
like
a
beastly
renegade
playing
against
wrykyn
said
mike
still
i
glad
we
won
adair
a
jolly
good
sort
and
it
make
him
happy
for
weeks
when
i
last
saw
comrade
adair
said
psmith
he
was
going
about
in
a
sort
of
trance
beaming
vaguely
and
wanting
to
stand
people
things
at
the
shop
he
bowled
awfully
well
yes
said
psmith
i
say
i
do
wish
to
cast
a
gloom
over
this
joyful
occasion
in
any
way
but
you
say
wrykyn
are
going
to
give
sedleigh
a
fixture
again
next
year
well
well
have
you
thought
of
the
massacre
which
will
ensue
you
will
have
left
adair
will
have
left
incidentally
i
shall
have
left
wrykyn
will
swamp
them
i
suppose
they
will
still
the
great
thing
you
see
is
to
get
the
thing
started
that
what
adair
was
so
keen
on
now
sedleigh
has
beaten
wrykyn
he
satisfied
they
can
get
fixtures
with
decent
clubs
and
work
up
to
playing
the
big
schools
you
got
to
start
somehow
so
all
right
you
see
and
besides
said
psmith
reflectively
in
an
emergency
they
can
always
get
comrade
downing
to
bowl
for
them
what
let
us
now
sally
out
and
see
if
we
