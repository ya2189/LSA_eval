tiger
and
tom
the
day
was
pleasant
in
that
particularly
pleasant
part
of
summer
time
which
the
boys
call
vacation
when
tiger
and
tom
walked
slowly
down
the
street
together
you
may
think
it
strange
that
i
mention
tiger
first
but
i
assure
you
tom
would
not
have
been
in
the
least
offended
by
the
preference
indeed
he
would
have
told
you
that
tiger
was
a
most
wonderful
dog
and
knew
as
much
as
any
two
boys
though
this
might
be
called
extravagant
nearly
a
year
ago
on
tom
birthday
tiger
arrived
as
a
present
from
tom
uncle
and
as
the
dog
leaped
with
a
dignified
bound
from
the
wagon
in
which
he
made
his
journey
tom
looked
for
a
moment
into
his
great
wise
eyes
and
impulsively
threw
his
arms
around
his
shaggy
neck
tiger
was
pleased
with
tom
bright
face
and
affectionately
licked
his
smooth
cheeks
so
the
league
of
friendship
was
complete
in
an
hour
tom
had
a
pleasant
round
face
and
you
might
live
with
him
a
week
and
think
him
one
of
the
noblest
most
generous
boys
you
ever
knew
but
some
day
you
would
probably
discover
that
he
had
a
most
violent
temper
you
would
be
frightened
to
see
his
face
crimson
with
rage
as
he
stamped
his
feet
shook
his
little
sister
spoke
improperly
to
his
mother
and
above
all
displeased
his
great
father
in
heaven
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
of
something
which
happened
to
tom
on
this
account
which
he
never
forgot
to
the
end
of
his
life
tiger
and
tom
were
walking
down
the
street
together
one
pleasant
day
when
they
met
dick
casey
a
schoolfellow
of
tom
illustration
o
dick
cried
tom
i
going
to
father
grain
store
a
little
while
let
go
up
in
the
loft
and
play
dick
had
just
finished
his
work
in
his
mother
garden
and
was
ready
for
a
little
amusement
so
the
two
went
up
in
the
loft
together
and
enjoyed
themselves
for
a
long
time
but
at
last
one
of
those
trifling
disputes
arose
in
which
little
boys
are
so
apt
to
indulge
pretty
soon
there
were
angry
words
then
oh
how
sorry
i
am
to
say
it
tom
wicked
passions
got
the
mastery
of
him
and
he
beat
little
dick
severely
tiger
who
must
have
been
ashamed
of
his
master
pulled
hard
at
his
coat
and
whined
piteously
but
all
in
vain
at
last
tom
stopped
from
mere
exhaustion
there
now
he
cried
which
is
right
you
or
i
i
am
sobbed
dick
and
you
tell
a
lie
tom
face
became
crimson
and
darting
upon
dick
he
gave
him
a
sudden
push
alas
he
was
near
to
the
open
door
dick
screamed
threw
up
his
arms
and
in
a
moment
was
gone
illustration
tom
heart
stood
still
and
an
icy
chill
crept
over
him
from
head
to
foot
at
first
he
could
not
stir
then
he
never
knew
how
he
got
there
but
he
found
himself
standing
beside
his
little
friend
some
men
were
raising
him
carefully
from
the
hard
sidewalk
is
he
dead
almost
screamed
tom
no
replied
one
we
hope
not
how
did
he
fall
out
he
did
fall
groaned
tom
who
never
could
be
so
mean
as
to
tell
a
lie
i
pushed
him
out
pushed
him
you
wicked
boy
cried
a
rough
voice
do
you
know
you
ought
to
be
sent
to
jail
and
if
he
dies
maybe
you
be
hung
tom
grew
as
white
as
dick
whom
he
had
followed
into
the
store
and
he
heard
all
that
passed
as
if
in
a
dream
is
he
badly
hurt
cried
some
one
only
his
hands
was
the
answer
the
rope
saved
him
he
caught
hold
of
the
rope
and
slipped
down
but
his
hands
are
dreadfully
torn
he
has
fainted
from
pain
just
then
tom
father
came
in
and
soon
understood
the
case
the
look
he
gave
his
unhappy
son
so
full
of
sorrow
not
unmingled
with
pity
was
too
much
for
tom
and
he
stole
out
followed
by
the
faithful
tiger
he
wandered
to
the
woods
and
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
one
hour
ago
he
was
a
happy
boy
and
now
what
a
terrible
change
what
had
made
the
difference
nothing
but
the
indulgence
of
this
wicked
violent
temper
his
mother
had
often
warned
him
of
the
fearful
consequences
she
had
told
him
that
little
boys
who
would
not
learn
to
govern
themselves
grew
up
to
be
very
wicked
men
and
often
became
murderers
in
some
moment
of
passion
and
now
tom
shuddered
to
think
he
was
almost
a
murderer
nothing
but
god
great
mercy
in
putting
that
rope
in
dick
way
had
saved
him
from
carrying
that
load
of
sorrow
and
guilt
all
the
rest
of
his
life
but
poor
dick
might
die
yet
how
pale
he
looked
how
strange
tom
fell
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
god
to
spare
dick
life
and
from
that
time
forth
with
god
help
he
promised
that
he
would
strive
to
conquer
his
wicked
temper
then
as
he
could
no
longer
bear
his
terrible
suspense
he
started
for
widow
casey
cottage
as
he
appeared
at
the
humble
door
casey
angrily
ordered
him
away
saying
you
have
made
a
poor
woman
trouble
enough
for
one
day
but
dick
feeble
voice
entreated
o
mother
let
him
come
in
i
was
just
as
bad
as
he
tom
gave
a
cry
of
joy
at
hearing
these
welcome
tones
and
sprang
hastily
in
there
sat
poor
dick
with
his
hands
bound
up
looking
very
pale
but
tom
thanked
god
that
he
was
alive
i
should
like
to
know
how
i
am
to
live
now
sighed
casey
who
will
weed
the
garden
and
carry
my
vegetables
to
market
i
am
afraid
we
shall
suffer
for
bread
before
the
summer
is
over
and
she
put
her
apron
to
her
eyes
casey
cried
tom
eagerly
i
will
do
everything
that
dick
did
i
will
sell
the
cabbages
potatoes
and
beans
and
will
drive
cows
to
pasture
casey
shook
her
head
incredulously
but
tom
bravely
kept
his
word
for
the
next
few
weeks
tom
was
at
his
post
bright
and
early
and
the
garden
was
never
kept
in
better
order
every
morning
tiger
and
tom
stood
faithfully
in
the
market
place
with
their
baskets
and
never
gave
up
no
matter
how
warm
the
day
till
the
last
vegetable
was
sold
and
the
money
placed
faithfully
in
casey
hand
tom
father
often
passed
through
the
market
and
gave
his
little
son
an
encouraging
smile
but
he
did
not
offer
to
help
him
out
of
his
difficulty
for
he
knew
if
tom
struggled
on
alone
it
would
be
a
lesson
he
would
never
forget
already
he
was
becoming
so
gentle
and
patient
that
every
one
noticed
the
change
and
his
mother
rejoiced
over
the
sweet
fruits
of
his
repentance
and
after
a
few
weeks
the
bandages
were
removed
from
dick
hands
but
they
had
been
unskillfully
treated
and
were
drawn
up
in
very
strange
shapes
casey
could
not
conceal
her
grief
he
will
never
be
the
help
he
was
before
she
said
to
tom
he
will
never
be
like
other
boys
and
he
wrote
such
a
fine
hand
now
he
can
no
more
make
a
letter
than
that
little
chicken
in
the
garden
if
we
only
had
a
great
city
doctor
said
a
neighbor
he
might
have
been
all
right
even
now
his
fingers
might
be
helped
if
you
should
take
him
to
new
york
oh
i
am
too
poor
said
she
and
burst
into
tears
tom
could
not
bear
it
and
again
rushed
into
the
woods
to
think
what
could
be
done
for
he
had
already
given
them
all
his
allowance
all
at
once
a
thought
flashed
into
his
head
and
he
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
then
he
cried
in
great
distress
no
no
anything
but
that
i
ca
do
tiger
gently
licked
his
hands
and
watched
him
with
great
concern
now
came
a
terrible
struggle
tom
paced
back
and
forth
and
although
he
was
a
proud
boy
he
sobbed
aloud
tiger
whined
licked
tom
face
rushed
off
into
dark
corners
and
barked
savagely
at
some
imaginary
enemy
and
then
came
back
and
putting
his
paws
on
his
young
knees
wagged
his
tail
in
anxious
sympathy
illustration
at
last
tom
took
his
hands
from
his
pale
tear
stained
face
and
looking
into
the
dog
great
honest
eyes
he
cried
with
a
queer
shake
in
his
voice
tiger
old
fellow
dear
old
dog
could
you
ever
forgive
me
if
i
sold
you
then
came
another
burst
of
sorrow
and
tom
rose
hastily
as
if
afraid
to
trust
himself
and
almost
ran
out
of
the
woods
over
the
fields
he
raced
with
tiger
close
at
his
heels
nor
rested
a
moment
till
he
stood
at
major
white
door
nearly
two
miles
away
do
you
still
want
tiger
sir
why
yes
said
the
old
man
in
great
surprise
but
it
ca
be
possible
that
you
want
to
sell
him
do
you
my
boy
and
the
kind
old
gentleman
gave
tom
a
quick
questioning
glance
yes
please
gasped
tom
not
daring
to
look
at
his
old
companion
the
exchange
was
quickly
made
and
the
ten
dollars
in
tom
hand
tiger
was
beguiled
into
a
barn
the
door
hastily
shut
and
tom
was
hurrying
off
when
he
turned
and
cried
in
a
choking
voice
you
will
be
kind
to
him
major
white
wo
you
do
whip
him
i
never
did
and
he
the
best
dog
no
no
child
said
major
white
kindly
i
treat
him
like
a
prince
and
if
you
ever
want
to
buy
him
back
you
shall
have
him
tom
managed
to
falter
thank
you
and
almost
flew
out
of
hearing
of
tiger
eager
scratching
on
the
barn
door
i
am
making
my
story
too
long
and
can
only
tell
you
in
a
few
words
that
tom
sacrifice
was
accepted
a
friend
took
little
dick
to
the
city
free
of
expense
and
tom
money
paid
for
the
necessary
operation
the
poor
crooked
fingers
were
very
much
improved
and
were
soon
almost
as
good
as
ever
and
the
whole
village
loved
tom
for
his
brave
spirit
and
the
noble
atonement
he
had
made
for
his
moment
of
passion
a
few
days
after
dick
return
came
tom
birthday
but
he
did
not
feel
in
his
usual
spirits
in
spite
of
his
delight
in
dick
recovery
he
had
so
mourned
over
the
matter
and
had
taken
tiger
loss
so
much
to
heart
that
he
had
grown
quite
pale
and
thin
so
as
he
was
allowed
to
spend
the
day
as
he
pleased
he
took
his
books
and
went
to
his
favorite
haunt
in
the
woods
he
lay
down
under
the
shade
of
a
maple
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
how
different
from
my
last
birthday
thought
tom
then
tiger
had
just
come
and
i
was
so
happy
though
i
did
like
him
half
as
well
as
i
do
now
tom
sighed
heavily
then
added
more
cheerfully
well
i
hope
some
things
are
better
than
they
were
last
year
i
hope
i
have
begun
to
conquer
myself
and
with
god
help
i
will
never
give
up
trying
while
i
live
but
o
how
much
sorrow
and
misery
i
have
made
for
myself
as
well
as
for
others
by
only
once
giving
way
to
my
wicked
foolish
temper
and
not
only
that
but
added
tom
with
a
sigh
i
can
never
forget
that
i
might
have
been
a
murderer
had
it
not
been
for
the
mercy
of
god
now
if
i
could
only
earn
money
enough
to
buy
back
dear
old
tiger
while
tom
was
busied
with
these
thoughts
he
heard
a
hasty
familiar
trot
a
quick
bark
of
joy
and
the
brave
old
dog
sprang
into
tom
arms
tiger
old
fellow
cried
tom
trying
to
look
fierce
though
he
could
scarcely
keep
down
the
tears
how
came
you
to
run
away
sir
tiger
responded
by
picking
up
a
letter
he
had
dropped
in
his
first
joy
and
laying
it
in
tom
hand
my
dear
child
tiger
is
pining
and
i
must
give
him
a
change
of
air
i
wish
him
to
have
a
good
master
and
knowing
that
the
best
ones
are
those
who
have
learned
to
govern
i
send
him
to
you
will
you
take
care
of
him
and
oblige
your
old
friend
major
white
tom
then
read
through
a
mist
of
tears
i
know
the
whole
story
dear
young
friend
be
not
weary
in
well
doing
illustration

those
scars
what
are
those
scars
questioned
mary
lanman
of
her
father
as
she
sat

holding
his
hand

her
own
little
ones

scars

dear

were
to
tell
you
the
history
of
them
it
would
make
a
long
story
but
do
tell
me
papa
said
mary
i
should
like
to
hear
a
long
story
these
scars
my
child
are
more
than
forty
years
old
for
forty
years
they
have
every
day
reminded
me
of
my
disobedience
to
my
parents
and
my
violation
of
the
law
of
god
do
tell
me
all
about
it
father
pleaded
mary
when
i
was
about
twelve
years
old
he
began
my
father
sent
me
one
pleasant
autumn
day
into
the
woods
to
cut
a
pole
to
be
used
in
beating
apples
off
the
trees
it
was
wanted
immediately
to
fill
the
place
of
one
that
had
been
broken
i
took
my
little
hatchet
and
hastened
to
the
woods
as
i
had
been
bidden
i
looked
in
every
direction
for
a
tall
slender
tree
that
would
answer
the
purpose
and
every
time
i
stopped
to
examine
a
young
tree
a
taller
and
straighter
sapling
caught
my
eye
farther
on
what
seemed
most
surprising
to
me
was
that
the
little
trees
that
looked
so
trim
and
upright
in
the
distance
grew
deformed
and
crooked
as
i
approached
them
frequently
disappointed
i
was
led
from
tree
to
tree
till
i
had
traversed
the
entire
grove
and
made
no
choice
my
path
opened
into
a
clearing
and
near
the
fence
stood
a
young
cherry
tree
loaded
with
fruit
here
was
a
strong
temptation
i
knew
very
well
to
whom
this
tree
belonged
and
that
it
bore
valuable
fruit
i
knew
too
that
i
had
no
right
to
touch
a
single
cherry
no
house
was
near
no
person
was
in
sight
none
but
god
could
see
me
and
i
forgot
that
his
eye
looked
down
upon
me
i
resolved
to
taste
the
tempting
fruit
i
climbed
the
tree
and
began
to
pick
the
rich
ripe
cherries
but
i
found
no
pleasure
in
the
taste
of
them
i
was
so
fearful
of
surprise
and
detection
some
one
might
come
and
find
me
in
the
tree
i
therefore
resolved
to
break
off
some
boughs
and
feast
upon
the
cherries
as
i
hastened
home
the
top
of
the
tree
was
bowed
with
the
weight
of
its
fruit
i
climbed
as
high
as
i
could
and
bending
down
the
top
attempted
to
cut
it
off
with
my
knife
in
my
eagerness
to
secure
my
prize
i
did
not
guard
my
left
hand
which
held
down
the
top
of
the
tree
my
knife
slipped
from
the
yielding
wood
to
my
fingers
and
passed
with
unspent
force
across
all
the
fingers
of
my
left
hand
cutting
the
flesh
to
the
bone
i
never
could
look
at
fresh
blood
without
fainting
my
eye
caught
sight
of
the
red
drops
that
oozed
from
every
finger
and
my
heart
began
to
die
within
me
i
slipped
through
the
limbs
of
the
tree
to
the
ground
the
shock
of
the
fall
drove
away
the
faintness
and
i
soon
stood
upon
my
feet
illustration
i
wrapped
my
handkerchief
about
my
bleeding
fingers
and
hurried
home
my
mission
was
worse
than
useless
i
had
not
accomplished
the
purpose
for
which
i
was
sent
i
had
committed
a
crime
and
disabled
myself
for
work
for
how
could
i
pick
apples
in
my
present
condition
i
found
no
sympathy
from
anybody
my
father
reproved
me
and
threatened
chastisement
when
my
wounds
were
healed
my
mother
who
dressed
my
aching
fingers
looked
very
sorrowfully
upon
me
and
i
knew
that
i
had
grieved
her
deeply
by
my
disobedience
i
assisted
in
picking
the
apples
but
i
was
compelled
to
work
with
one
hand
while
the
other
hung
in
a
sling
that
was
a
sad
day
for
me
it
required
some
weeks
to
heal
the
deep
gashes
made
by
my
knife
and
the
scars
are
as
bright
after
forty
years
as
they
were
when
the
wounds
were
first
closed
but
if
the
scars
in
the
flesh
were
all
it
would
have
been
comparatively
a
trifle
but
the
soul
was
wounded
as
well
as
the
body
the
conscience
was
defiled
with
guilt
tears
of
repentance
could
not
wipe
away
the
stain
nothing
but
the
blood
of
christ
could
give
health
to
the
wounded
spirit
as
wounds
leave
scars
so
my
dear
child
youthful
sins
leave
the
traces
of
their
existence
like
the
scars
of
the
healed
wound
they
disfigure
and
weaken
the
soul
the
follies
of
youth
may
be
overcome
but
they
are
always
sure
to
leave
their
mark
every
sin
of
childhood
hangs
like
a
weight
upon
the
neck
of
manhood
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
alone
cleanseth
from
all
sin

guy
morgan
came
in
from
school
with
rapid
step
and
impetuous
manner
his
mother
looked
up
from
her
work
there
was
a
round
red
spot
on
his
cheek
and
an
ominous
glitter
in
his
eyes
she
knew
the
signs
his
naturally
fierce
temper
had
been
stirred
in
some
way
to
a
heat
that
had
kindled
his
whole
nature
he
tossed
down
his
cap
threw
himself
on
an
ottoman
at
her
feet
and
then
said
with
still
a
little
of
the
heat
of
his
temper
in
his
tone
never
say
after
this
that
i
do
love
you
mother
i
think
i
never
did
say
so
she
answered
gently
as
she
passed
her
hand
over
the
tawny
locks
and
brushed
them
away
from
the
flushed
brow
but
what
special
thing
have
you
done
to
prove
your
love
for
me
just
now
taken
a
blow
without
returning
it
she
bent
over
and
kissed
her
boy
he
was
fifteen
years
old
a
tall
fellow
with
strong
muscles
but
he
had
not
grown
above
liking
his
mother
kisses
then
she
said
softly
tell
me
all
about
it
guy
o
it
was
dick
osgood
you
know
what
a
mean
fellow
he
is
anyhow
he
had
been
tormenting
some
of
the
younger
boys
till
i
could
not
stand
it
every
one
of
them
is
afraid
of
him
i
told
him
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
and
tried
to
make
him
leave
off
till
after
a
while
he
turned
from
them
and
coming
to
me
he
struck
me
in
the
face
i
believe
the
mark
is
there
now
and
he
turned
the
other
cheek
toward
his
mother
her
heart
was
filled
with
sympathy
and
secret
indignation
illustration
well
she
said
and
you
what
did
you
do
i
remembered
what
i
had
promised
you
for
this
year
and
i
took
it
think
of
it
mother
took
it
and
never
touched
him
i
just
looked
into
his
eyes
and
said
i
should
strike
you
back
i
should
lower
myself
to
your
level
he
laughed
a
great
scornful
laugh
and
said
hear
boys
turned
preacher
you
better
wait
sir
before
you
lecture
me
on
my
behavior
to
the
little
ones
till
you
have
pluck
enough
to
defend
them
i
heard
about
the
last
impudence
i
shall
from
a
coward
like
you
the
boys
laughed
and
some
of
them
said
for
you
osgood
and
i
came
home
i
had
done
it
for
the
sake
of
my
promise
to
you
for
stronger
than
he
is
any
day
and
know
mother
whether
there
a
drop
of
coward
blood
in
my
veins
i
thought
you
were
the
one
to
comfort
me
though
it
is
comfort
i
want
so
much
either
i
just
want
you
to
release
me
from
that
promise
and
let
me
go
back
and
thrash
him
morgan
heart
thrilled
with
silent
thanksgiving
her
boy
temper
had
been
her
greatest
grief
his
father
was
dead
and
she
had
brought
him
up
alone
and
sometimes
she
was
afraid
her
too
great
tenderness
had
spoiled
him
she
had
tried
in
vain
to
curb
his
passionate
nature
it
was
a
power
which
no
bands
could
bind
she
had
concluded
at
last
that
the
only
hope
was
in
enlisting
his
own
powerful
will
and
making
him
resolve
to
conquer
himself
now
he
had
shown
himself
capable
of
in
the
midst
of
his
anger
he
had
remembered
his
pledge
to
her
and
had
kept
it
he
would
yet
be
his
own
master
this
brave
boy
of
hers
and
the
kingdom
of
his
own
mind
would
be
a
goodly
sovereignty
better
heap
coals
of
fire
on
his
head
she
said
quietly
yes
he
deserves
a
good
scorching
pretending
to
misunderstand
her
but
i
should
not
have
thought
would
be
so
revengeful
you
know
well
enough
what
kind
of
coals
i
mean
and
it
was
that
said
thine
enemy
hunger
feed
him
if
he
thirst
give
him
drink
i
can
not
release
you
from
your
promise
till
the
year
for
which
you
made
it
is
over
i
think
that
the
master
who
told
us
to
render
good
for
evil
understood
all
the
wants
and
passions
of
humanity
better
than
any
other
teacher
has
ever
understood
them
i
am
sure
that
what
he
said
must
be
wise
and
right
and
best
i
want
you
to
try
his
way
first
if
that
fails
there
will
be
time
enough
after
this
year
to
make
a
different
experiment
well
i
promised
you
he
said
and
i
show
you
that
at
least
strong
enough
to
keep
my
word
until
you
release
me
from
it
i
think
though
you
do
quite
know
how
hard
it
is
morgan
knew
that
it
was
very
hard
for
a
true
boy
to
be
called
a
coward
but
she
knew
also
that
the
truest
bravery
on
earth
is
the
bravery
of
endurance
look
out
for
the
coals
of
fire
she
said
smilingly
as
her
boy
started
for
school
the
next
morning
keep
a
good
watch
and
i
pretty
sure
you
find
them
before
the
summer
is
over
but
he
came
home
at
night
depressed
and
a
little
gloomy
there
had
always
been
a
sort
of
rivalry
between
him
and
dick
osgood
and
now
the
boys
seemed
to
have
gone
over
to
the
stronger
side
and
he
had
that
bitter
feeling
of
humiliation
and
disgrace
which
is
as
bitter
to
a
boy
as
the
sense
of
defeat
ever
is
to
a
man
the
weeks
went
on
and
the
feeling
wore
away
a
little
still
the
memory
of
that
blow
rankled
in
guy
mind
and
made
him
unsocial
and
ill
at
ease
his
mother
watched
him
with
some
anxiety
but
did
not
interfere
she
had
the
true
wisdom
to
leave
him
to
learn
some
of
the
lessons
of
life
alone
at
length
came
the
last
day
of
school
followed
next
day
by
a
picnic
in
which
all
the
scholars
superintended
by
their
teachers
were
to
join
guy
morgan
hesitated
a
little
and
then
concluded
to
go
the
place
selected
was
a
lovely
spot
known
in
all
the
neighborhood
as
the
old
mill
it
was
on
the
banks
of
the
quassit
river
where
the
stream
ran
fast
and
the
grass
was
green
and
great
trees
with
drooping
boughs
shut
away
the
july
sunlight
among
the
rest
were
dick
osgood
and
his
little
sister
hetty
the
one
human
being
whom
he
seemed
really
and
tenderly
to
love
the
eyes
were
on
him
for
this
one
day
and
he
did
not
venture
to
insult
the
older
scholars
or
domineer
over
the
little
ones
he
and
guy
kept
apart
as
much
as
they
conveniently
could
and
guy
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
day
and
really
enjoyed
it
much
better
than
he
had
anticipated
dinner
was
spread
on
the
grass
and
though
it
was
eaten
with
pewter
spoons
and
out
of
crockery
of
every
hue
and
kind
it
was
certainly
eaten
with
greater
enjoyment
and
keener
appetite
than
if
it
had
been
served
in
the
finest
dining
room
they
made
dinner
last
as
long
as
they
could
and
then
they
scattered
here
and
there
to
enjoy
themselves
as
they
liked

morgan
caught
her
by
her
long
golden
hair
on
the
bridge
just
above
the
falls
stood
a
little
group
fishing
among
them
were
dick

and
his
sister

morgan
always
deeply
interested
in
the
study
of
botany
was
a
little
distance
away
with
one
of
the
teachers
pulling
in
pieces
a
curious
flower
suddenly
a
wild
cry
arose
above
the
sultry
stillness
of
the
summer
afternoon
and
the
hum
of
quiet
voices
round
it
was

coming
with
flying
feet
a
race
for
life
he
unbuttoned
coat
and
vest
as
he
ran
and
cast
them
off
as
he
neared
the
bridge
he
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
threw
himself
over
they
heard
him
strike
the
water
he
went
under
rose
again
and
then
struck
out
toward
the
golden
head
which
just
then
rose
for
the
second
time
every
one
who
stood
there
lived
moments
which
seemed
hours
sharp
the
teacher
with
whom
guy
had
been
talking
and
some
of
the
boys
got
a
strong
rope
and
running
down
the
stream
threw
it
out
on
the
water
just
above
the
falls
where
guy
could
reach
it
if
he
could
get
so
near
the
shore
the
water
was
very
deep
where
hetty
had
fallen
in
and
the
river
ran
fast
it
was
sweeping
the
poor
child
on
and
dick
osgood
threw
himself
upon
the
bridge
and
sobbed
and
screamed
when
she
rose
the
third
time
she
was
near
the
falls
a
moment
more
and
she
would
go
over
down
on
the
jagged
cruel
rocks
beneath
but
that
time
guy
morgan
caught
her
caught
her
by
her
long
glistening
golden
hair
sharp
shouted
to
him
he
saw
the
rope
and
swam
toward
it
his
strong
right
arm
beating
the
water
back
with
his
left
motionless
holding
his
white
burden
o
god
sharp
prayed
fervently
keep
him
up
spare
his
strength
a
little
longer
a
little
longer
a
moment
more
and
he
reached
the
rope
and
clung
to
it
desperately
while
teacher
and
boys
drew
the
two
in
over
the
slippery
edge
out
of
the
horrible
seething
waters
and
took
them
in
their
arms
but
they
were
both
silent
and
motionless
sharp
spoke
guy
name
but
he
did
not
answer
would
either
of
them
ever
answer
again
teachers
and
scholars
went
to
work
alike
for
their
restoration
it
was
well
that
there
was
intelligent
guidance
or
their
best
efforts
might
have
failed
guy
being
the
stronger
was
first
to
revive

hetty
safe
he
asked
only
god
knows
sharp
answered
we
are
doing
our
best
it
was
almost
half
an
hour
before
hetty
opened
her
blue
eyes
meantime
dick
had
been
utterly
frantic
and
helpless
he
had
sobbed
and
groaned
and
even
prayed
in
a
wild
fashion
of
his
own
which
perhaps
the
pitying
father
understood
and
answered
when
he
heard
his
sister
voice
he
was
like
one
beside
himself
with
joy
but
sharp
quieted
him
by
a
few
low
firm
words
which
no
one
else
understood
some
of
the
larger
girls
arranged
one
of
the
wagons
and
received
hetty
into
it
sharp
drove
home
with
guy
morgan
when
he
reached
his
mother
gate
guy
insisted
on
going
in
alone
he
thought
it
might
alarm
her
to
see
some
one
helping
him
besides
he
wanted
her
a
few
minutes
quite
to
himself
so
sharp
drove
away
and
guy
went
in
his
mother
saw
him
coming
and
opened
the
door
where
have
you
been

cried
seeing

wet
disordered
plight
in

fishing
out

then
while
she
was
busying
herself
with
preparations
for
his
comfort
he
quietly
told
his
story
his

eyes
were
dim
and
her
heart
throbbed
chokingly

him
close

i
had
been
there

i
could
have
let
you
do
it
i
went
in
after

coals

fire
mother
morgan
knew
how
to
laugh
as
well
as
to
cry
over
her
boy
heard
of
people
smart
enough
to
set
the
river
on
fire
she
said
but
you
are
the
first
one
i
ever
knew
who
went
in
there
after
the
coals
the
next
morning
came
a
delegation
of
the
boys
with
dick
osgood
at
their
head
every
one
was
there
who
had
seen
the
blow
which
dick
struck
and
heard
his
taunts
afterward
they
came
into
the
sitting
room
and
said
their
say
to
guy
before
his
mother
dick
was
spokesman
i
have
come
he
said
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
i
struck
you
a
mean
unjustifiable
blow
you
received
it
with
noble
contempt
to
provoke
you
into
fighting
i
called
you
a
coward
meaning
to
bring
you
down
by
some
means
to
my
own
level
you
bore
that
too
with
a
greatness
i
was
not
great
enough
to
understand
but
i
do
understand
it
now
i
have
seen
you
all
we
boys
have
seen
you
face
to
face
with
death
and
have
seen
that
you
were
not
afraid
of
him
you
fought
with
him
and
came
off
ahead
and
we
all
are
come
to
do
honor
to
the
bravest
boy
in
town
and
i
to
thank
you
for
a
life
a
great
deal
dearer
and
better
worth
saving
than
my
own
dick
broke
down
just
there
for
the
tears
choked
him
guy
was
as
grand
in
his
forgiveness
as
he
had
been
in
his
forbearance
hetty
and
her
father
and
mother
came
afterward
and
guy
found
himself
a
hero
before
he
knew
it
but
none
of
it
all
moved
him
as
did
his
few
fond
words
and
the
pride
in
her
joyful
eyes
he
had
kept
with
honor
and
with
peace
his
pledge
to
her
and
he
had
his
reward
the
master
way
of
peace
had
not
missed
him

i
do
not
believe
two
more
excellent
people
could
be
found
than
gideon
randal
and
his
wife
to
lift
the
fallen
and
to
minister
to
the
destitute
was
their
constant
habit
and
delight
they
often
sacrificed
their
own
comforts
for
the
benefit
of
others
in

their
friends
protested
at
this
course
gideon
randal
unfailing
reply
was
i
think
there
enough
left
to
carry
martha
and
me
through
life
and
some
besides
what
we
give
to
the
poor
we
lend
to
the
lord
and
if
a
dark
day
comes
he
will
provide
the
dark
day
came
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
reached
the
age
of
three
score
and
ten
years
as
old
age
came
upon
him
and
his
little
farm
became
less
productive
debts
accumulated
being
forced
to
raise
money
he
had
borrowed
a
thousand
dollars
of
esquire
harrington
giving
him
a
mortgage
on
his
home
for
security
but
as
the
interest
was
regularly
paid
his
creditor
was
well
satisfied
however
harrington
died
suddenly
and
his
son
a
merciless
grasping
man
wrote
randal
demanding
payment
of
the
mortgage
vainly
did
the
old
man
plead
for
an
extension
of
time
the
demand
was
pressed
to
such
an
extent
that
it
even
become
a
threat
to
deprive
him
of
his
home
unless
payment
were
made
within
a
given
time
martha
he
said
to
his
wife
young
harrington
is
a
hard
man
he
has
me
in
his
power
and
he
will
not
scruple
to
ruin
me
i
think
i
would
better
go
and
talk
with
him
telling
him
how
little
i
have
it
may
be
he
will
pity
two
old
people
and
allow
us
better
terms
but
husband
you
are
not
used
to
traveling
harrowtown
is
a
hundred
miles
away
and
you
are
old
and
feeble
too
true
wife
but
i
can
talk
much
better
than
i
can
write
and
besides
luke
conway
lives
there
you
remember
i
took
an
interest
in
him
when
he
was
a
poor
boy
perhaps
he
will
advise
and
help
us
now
that
we
are
in
trouble
at
last
since
he
felt
that
he
must
go
randal
reluctantly
consented
and
fitted
him
out
for
the
journey
with
great
care
the
next
morning
was
warm
and
sunny
for
november
and
the
old
man
started
for
harrowtown
gideon
called
randal
as
he
walked
slowly
down
the
road
be
sure
to
take
tight
hold
of
the
railing
when
you
get
in
and
out
of
the
cars
i
be
careful
martha
and
with
one
more
good
bye
wave
of
his
hand
the
old
man
hurried
on
to
take
the
stage
which
was
to
carry
him
to
the
station
but
misfortune
met
him
at
the
very
outset
the
stage
was
heavily
loaded
and
on
the
way
one
of
the
wheels
broke
down
this
caused
such
a
delay
that
randal
missed
the
morning
train
and
the
next
did
not
come
for
several
hours
it
was
afternoon
when
he
finally
started
he
became
anxious
and
weary
from
long
waiting
and
after
three
stations
were
passed
he
became
nervous
and
worried
how
long
before
we
reach
harrowtown
he
inquired
stopping
the
busy
conductor
at
half
past
eight
illustration
long
before
we
reach
harrowtown
another
question
was
upon
randal
lips
but
the
conductor
was
gone
not
reach
there
until
evening
he
exclaimed
to
himself
in
dismay
and
pitch
dark
for
there
no
moon
now
i
shall
not
know
where
to
go
presently
the
conductor
passed
again
mr
conductor
will
you
kindly
tell
me
when
to
get
out
i
never
been
to
harrowtown
and
i
do
want
to
stop
at
the
wrong
place
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
was
the
polite
reply
i
let
you
know
i
will
not
forget
you
soothed
by
this
assurance
the
old
man
settled
back
in
his
seat
and
finally
went
to
sleep
in
the
seat
behind
him
sat
a
tall
handsome
boy
his
name
was
albert
gregory
he
was
bright
and
intelligent
but
there
was
an
expression
of
cruelty
about
his
mouth
and
a
look
about
his
eyes
that
was
cold
and
unfeeling
this
lad
saw
the
old
man
fall
asleep
and
he
nudged
his
companion
see
here
john
by
and
by
i
play
a
good
joke
on
that
old
country
greeny
and
you
see
fun
on
rushed
the
train
mile
after
mile
was
passed
daylight
faded
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
in
the
cars
and
still
the
old
man
slept
watched
by
his
purposed
tormentor
and
the
other
boy
who
wanted
to
see
the
fun
at
last
the
speed
of
the
train
began
to
slacken
they
were
nearing
a
station
albert
sprang
up
and
shook
randal
violently
wake
up
wake
up
he
called
sharply
this
is
harrowtown
you
must
get
off
here
thus
roughly
roused
the
old
man
started
from
his
seat
and
gazed
around
in
a
bewildered
way
the
change
from
daylight
to
darkness
the
unaccustomed
awakening
on
a
moving
train
and
the
glare
of
the
lights
added
tenfold
to
his
confusion
wh
what
did
you
say
boy
he
asked
helplessly
this
is
harrowtown
the
place
where
you
want
to
stop
you
must
get
off
be
quick
or
you
be
carried
by
the
noise
of
the
brakes
and
ignorance
of
the
real
locality
on
the
part
of
those
near
enough
to
have
heard
him
prevented
any
correction
of
the
boy
cruel
falsehood
randal
knew
it
was
not
the
conductor
who
had
aroused
him
but
supposing
albert
to
be
some
employee
of
the
road
he
hurried
to
the
car
door
with
tottering
steps
the
name
of
the
station
was
called
at
the
other
end
of
the
car
a
name
quite
unlike
that
of
harrowtown
but
his
dull
ears
did
not
notice
it
he
got
off
upon
the
platform
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
or
knew
his
error
the
train
was
again
in
motion
illustration
is
harrowtown
be
quick
or
you
be
carried
albert
was
in
ecstasies
over
the
success
of
his
joke
and
shook
all
over
with
laughter
in
which
of
course
his
companion
joined
o
dear
that
jolly
fun
he
cried
is
it
john
john
assented
that
it
was
very
funny
indeed
neither
of
the
boys
had
noticed
that
the
seat
lately
occupied
by
the
poor
old
man
had
just
been
taken
by
a
gentleman
wrapped
in
a
heavy
cloak
who
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
but
who
really
heard
every
word
they
said
they
kept
up
a
brisk
conversation
albert
speaking
in
a
loud
tone
for
he
was
feeling
very
merry
ha
ha
ha
but
i
did
think
the
old
fool
would
hear
the
brakeman
call
the
station
though
i
did
suppose
i
could
get
him
any
farther
than
the
door
to
think
of
his
clambering
clear
out
on
the
platform
and
getting
left
he
believed
every
word
i
told
him
what
a
delicious
old
simpleton
and
having
exhausted
that
edifying
subject
for
the
moment
he
presently
began
to
boast
of
his
plans
and
prospects
i
do
believe
you
stand
much
of
a
chance
there
they
say
luke
conway
awful
particular
the
stranger
heard
john
remark
pooh
shut
up
cried
albert
particular
that
just
it
and
that
makes
my
chance
all
the
better
i
brought
the
kind
of
recommendations
that
a
particular
man
wants
you
see
but
there
be
lots
of
other
fellows
trying
for
the
place
do
care
if
there
fifty
said
albert
i
come
in
ahead
of
all
i
got
testimonials
of
character
and
qualifications
from
howe
rev
joseph
lee
henshaw
and
esq
jenks
the
great
railroad
contractor
his
name
alone
is
enough
to
secure
me
the
situation
at
this
the
gentleman
on
the
next
seat
turned
and
gave
albert
a
quick
searching
glance
but
the
conceited
boy
was
too
much
occupied
with
himself
to
notice
the
movement
and
kept
on
talking
now
and
then
the
thought
of
the
victim
whom
he
had
so
cruelly
deceived
seemed
to
come
back
and
amuse
him
amazingly
wonder
where
the
old
man
is
now
ha
ha
do
you
suppose
he
has
found
out
where
harrowtown
is
oh
but
was
it
rich
to
see
how
scared
he
was
when
i
awoke
him
and
how
he
jumped
and
scrambled
out
of
the
car
my
word
i
never
saw
anything
so
comical
here
the
stranger
turned
again
and
shot
another
quick
glance
this
time
from
indignant
eyes
and
his
lips
parted
as
if
about
to
utter
a
stern
reproof
but
he
did
not
speak
we
will
now
leave
albert
and
his
and
follow
good
gideon
randal
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
stepped
from
the
cars
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
find
aaron
harrington
he
inquired
of
a
man
at
the
station
there
no
such
man
living
here
to
my
knowledge
was
the
reply
what
is
this
harrowtown
asked
randal
in
great
consternation
no
it
is
whipple
village
then
i
got
out
at
the
wrong
station
what
shall
i
do
in
a
voice
of
deep
distress
go
right
to
the
hotel
and
stay
till
the
train
goes
in
the
morning
said
the
man
pleasantly
there
was
no
alternative
randal
passed
a
restless
night
at
the
hotel
and
at
an
early
hour
he
was
again
at
the
station
waiting
for
the
train
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eye
wild
and
anxious
the
stage
broke
down
and
i
missed
the
first
train
thought
he
and
then
that
boy
told
me
to
get
out
here
i
made
a
bad
beginning
and
i
afraid
this
trip
will
have
a
bad
ending
illustration
me
to
assist
you
there
were
many
passengers
walking
to
and
fro
on
the
platform
waiting
for
the
cars
to
come
among
them
was
a
boy
who
had
been
accompanied
to
the
station
by
his
mother
just
before
she
bade
him
she
said
lyman
look
at
that
pale
sad
old
man
i
do
believe
he
is
used
to
traveling
perhaps
you
can
help
him
along
as
the
train
came
into
the
station
the
lad
stepped
up
to
randal
and
said
respectfully
allow
me
to
assist
you
sir
then
he
took
hold
of
his
arm
and
guided
him
into
the
car
to
a
seat
thank
you
my
boy
i
getting
old
and
clumsy
and
a
little
help
from

right
where
his
office
is
i
been
in
harrowtown
a
good
many
times
half
an
hour
later
the
brakeman
shouted
the
name
of
the
station
where
they
must
stop
lyman
assisted
randal
off
the
train
and
walked
with
him
to
the
principal
street
here
harrington
office
said
he
oh
yes
thank
you
kindly
and
now
could
you
tell
me
where
luke
conway
place
of
business
is
why
that
the
very
gentleman
i
going
to
see
said
lyman
his
place
is
just
round
the
corner
only
two
blocks
off
randal
was
deeply
interested
he
turned
and
shook
the
boy
hand
warmly
lyman
he
said
conway
knows
me
i
am
going
to
see
him
i
am
really
obliged
to
you
for
your
politeness
and
wish
i

you
the
situation
for
you
deserve
it
if
you

i
get
there
tell

gideon
randal
is
your
friend
fifteen
minutes
after
found
lyman
waiting
in
the
of
luke
conway
store
albert
gregory
had
just
preceded
him
the
merchant
was
writing
and
he
had
requested
the
boys
to
be
seated
a
short
time
till
he
was
at
leisure
before
he
finished
his
work
a
slow
feeble
step
was
heard
approaching
and
an
old
man
stood
in
the
doorway
luke
do
you
remember
me
the
merchant
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
then
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
grasped
the
old
man
hands
in
both
his
own
illustration
my
benefactor
randal
welcome
a
thousand
times
welcome
my
benefactor
he
exclaimed
seating
his
guest
conway
inquired
after
his
health
and
comfort
and
talked
with
him
as
tenderly
as
a
loving
son
it
was
evident
to
the
quick
perception
of
the
merchant
that
the
good
old
circumstances
had
changed
and
he
soon
made
it
easy
for
him
to
unburden
his
mind
yes
luke
i
am
in
trouble
aaron
harrington
owns
a
mortgage
on
my
farm
i
ca
pay
him
and
he
threatens
to
take
my
home
said
randal
with
a
quivering
lip
i
went
to
his
office
but
did
find
him
and
i
thought
may
be
you
advise
me
what
to
do
randal
answered
the
merchant
laying
his
hand
on
the
old
shoulder
almost
thirty
years
ago
when
i
was
cold
and
hungry
and
friendless
you
took
me
in
and
fed
me
your
good
wife
god
bless
her
made
me
a
suit
of
clothes
with
her
own
hands
you
found
me
work
and
you
gave
me
money
when
i
begun
the
world
alone
much
if
not
all
that
i
am
in
life
i
owe
to
your
sympathy
and
help
my
kind
old
friend
now
i
am
rich
and
you
must
let
me
cancel
my
debt
i
shall
pay
your
mortgage
you
shall
have
your
home
free
again
randal
wiped
great
hot
tears
from
his
cheeks
and
said
in
a
husky
voice
it
is
just
as
i
told
martha
i
knew
if
we
lent
our
money
to
the
lord
when
a
dark
day
came
he
would
provide
the
reader
can
imagine
the
different
feelings
of
the
two
boys
as
they
sat
witnesses
of
the
scene
the
look
of
derision
that
changed
to
an
expression
of
sickly
dismay
on
albert
face
when
the
old
man
came
in
and
was
so
warmly
greeted
by
the
merchant
was
curiously
suggestive
but
his
usual
assurance
soon
returned
he
thought
it
unlikely
that
randal
would
recognize
him
in
the
daylight
and
he
determined
to
put
on
a
bold
front
for
a
minute
the
two
men
continued
in
conversation
conway
called
up
pleasant
reminiscences
of
aunt
martha
his
on
the
farm
and
the
peace
and
stillness
of
the
country
town
he
thought
a
railway
ride
of
a
hundred
miles
must
be
quite
a
hardship
for
a
quiet
old
man
it
was
a
long
way
for
you
he
said
did
you
have
a
comfortable
journey
well
i
ca
quite
say
that
first
the
stage
broke
down
and
delayed
me
then
i
slept
in
the
cars
and
a
boy
played
a
trick
on
me
and
waked
me
up
and
made
me
get
out
at
the
wrong
station
so
i
had
to
stay
over
nigh
in
whipple
village
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
a
great
deal
of
worriment
with
one
thing
and
another
getting
here
but
it
all
right
now
he
added
with
a
radiant
face
illustration
this
the
boy
who
lied
to
you
shall
go
with
me
to
my
house
and
rest
as
soon
as
i
have
dismissed
these
boys
said
conway
earnestly
and
turning
to
albert
and
lyman
who
anxiously
waited
he
spoke
to
them
about
their
errand
i
suppose
you
came
because
you
saw
my
advertisement
yes
sir
replied
both
simultaneously
very
well
i
believe
you
came
in
first
he
began
turning
to
albert
what
is
your
name
i
am
albert
gregory
sir
i
think
i
can
suit
you
i
brought
testimonials
of
ability
and
character
from
some
of
the
first
men
esq
jenks
rev
joseph
lee
henshaw
and
others
here
are
my
letters
of
recommendation
holding
them
out
for
conway
to
take
i
do
care
to
see
them
returned
the
merchant
coldly
i
have
seen
you
before
i
understand
your
character
well
enough
for
the
present
he
then
addressed
a
few
words
to
lyman
dean
i
should
be
very
glad
of
work
said
lyman
my
mother
is
poor
and
i
want
to
earn
my
living
but
i
have
any
testimonials
yes
you
have
said
old
randal
who
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
say
that
very
thing
and
then
he
told
the
merchant
how
polite
and
helpful
lyman
had
been
to
him
conway
fixed
his
eyes
severely
upon
the
other
boy
the
contrast
between
him
and
young
dean
was
certainly
worth
a
lesson
albert
gregory
said
the
merchant
i
occupied
the
seat
in
the
car
in
front
of
you
last
evening
i
heard
you
exultingly
and
wickedly
boasting
how
you
had
deceived
a
distressed
and
helpless
old
man
randal
is
this
the
boy
who
lied
to
you
and
caused
you
to
get
out
at
the
wrong
station
i
declare
now
i
do
remember
him
it
is
i
sure
it
is
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
fixing
his
earnest
eyes
full
upon
the
crimson
face
of
the
young
man
it
was
useless
for
albert
to
attempt
any
vindication
of
himself
his
stammered
excuses
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
was
glad
to
hide
his
mortification
by
an
early
escape
crestfallen
he
slunk
away
taking
all
his
testimonials
with
him
lyman
said
conway
kindly
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
employ
you
in
my
store
you
shall
have
good
pay
if
you
do
well
and
i
am
sure
you
will
you
may
begin
work
at
once
lyman
eyes
danced
with
joy
as
he
left
the
to
receive
his
instructions
from
the
head
clerk
conway
furnished
the
money
to
pay
the
debt
due
to
harrington
by
randal
and
a
heavy
load
was
lifted
from
the
good
old
heart
he
remained
a
visitor
two
or
three
days
in
conway
house
where
he
was
treated
with
the
utmost
deference
and
attention
illustration
randal
pays
mr
conway
also
purchased
for
him
a
suit
of
warm
clothes
and
an
overcoat
and
sent
his
confidential
clerk
with
him
on
his
return
journey
to
see
him
safely
home
nor
was
good
randal
forgotten
she
received
a
handsome
present
in
money
from
conway
and
a
message
full
of
grateful
affection
nothing
ever
after
occurred
to
disturb
the
lives
of
the
aged
and
worthy
pair
albert
gregory
secured
an
excellent
situation
in
new
york
but
his
false
character
and
his
wanton
disregard
of
others
feelings
and
rights
made
him
as
hateful
to
his
employers
as
to
all
his
associates
and
it
soon
became
necessary
for
him
to
seek
another
place
he
has
changed
places
many
times
since
and
his
career
has
been
an
unhappy
one
another
example
of
the
results
of
frivolous
habits
and
a
heartless
nature
lyman
dean
is
now
a
successful
merchant
a
partner
of
conway
and
occupies
a
high
position
in
society
as
an
honorable
enterprising
man
but
best
of
all
he
is
a
christian
and
finds
deep
satisfaction
and
happiness
in
the
service
of
him
who
has
said
thou
shalt
rise
up
before
the
hoary
head
and
honor
the
face
of
the

bert
thanksgiving
at
noon
on
a
dreary
november
day
a
lonesome
little
fellow
stood
at
the
door
of
a
cheap
eating
house
in
boston
and
offered
a
solitary
copy
of
a
morning
paper
for
sale
to
the
people
passing
but
there
were
really
not
many
people
passing
for
it
was
thanksgiving
day
and
the
shops
were
shut
and
everybody
who
had
a
home
to
go
to
and
a
dinner
to
eat
seemed
to
have
gone
home
to
eat
that
dinner
bert
hampton
the
newsboy
stood
trying
in
vain
to
sell
the
last
left
on
his
hands
by
the
dull
business
of
the
morning
an
old
man
with
a
face
that
looked
pinched
and
who
was
dressed
in
a
seedy
black
coat
stopped
at
the
same
doorway
and
with
one
hand
on
the
latch
he
appeared
to
hesitate
between
hunger
and
a
sense
of
poverty
before
going
in
it
was
possible
however
that
he
was
considering
whether
he
could
afford
himself
the
indulgence
of
a
morning
paper
seeing
it
was
thanksgiving
day
so
at
least
bert
thought
and
addressed
him
accordingly
buy
a
paper
sir
all
about
the
fire
in
east
boston
and
arrest
of
in
springfield
only
two
cents
the
little
old
man
looked
at
the
boy
with
keen
gray
eyes
which
seemed
to
light
up
the
pinched
look
of
his
face
and
answered
in
a
shrill
voice
you
ought
to
come
down
in
your
price
this
time
of
day
you
expect
to
sell
a
morning
paper
at
for
full
price
well
give
me
a
cent
then
said
bert
that
less
than
cost
but
never
mind
i
bound
to
sell
out
anyhow
illustration
a
paper
you
look
cold
said
the
old
man
cold
replied
bert
i
nearly
froze
and
i
want
my
dinner
and
going
to
have
a
big
dinner
too
seeing
it
thanksgiving
day
ah
lucky
for
you
my
boy
said
the
old
man
you
a
home
to
go
to
and
friends
too
i
hope
no
sir
no
home
and
no
friend
only
my
mother
bert
hesitated
and
grew
serious
then
suddenly
changed
his
tone
and
hop
houghton
i
told
him
to
meet
me
here
and
we
have
a
thanksgiving
dinner
together
for
it
no
fun
to
be
eating
alone
thanksgiving
day
it
sets
a
fellow
thinking
if
he
ever
had
a
home
and
then
has
got
a
home
any
more
it
more
lonesome
not
to
eat
at
all
said
the
old
man
his
gray
eyes
twinkling
and
what
can
a
boy
like
you
have
to
think
of
here
i
guess
i
can
find
one
cent
for
you
though
there
nothing
in
the
paper
i
know
the
old
man
spoke
with
some
feeling
his
fingers
trembled
and
somehow
he
dropped
two
cents
instead
of
one
into
bert
hand
here
you
made
a
mistake
cried
bert
a
bargain
a
bargain
you
given
me
a
cent
too
much
no
i
did
i
never
give
anybody
a
cent
too
much
but
see
here
and
bert
showed
the
two
cents
offering
to
return
one
no
matter
said
the
old
man
it
will
be
so
much
less
for
dinner
that
all
bert
had
instinctively
pocketed
the
pennies
but
his
sympathies
were
excited
poor
old
man
he
thought
he
seen
better
days
i
guess
perhaps
he
no
home
a
boy
like
me
can
stand
it
but
i
guess
it
must
be
hard
for
him
he
meant
to
give
me
the
odd
cent
all
the
while
and
i
believe
he
has
had
a
decent
dinner
for
many
a
day
all
this
which
i
have
been
obliged
to
write
out
slowly
in
words
went
through
bert
mind
like
a
flash
he
was
a
generous
little
fellow
and
any
kindness
shown
him
no
matter
how
trifling
made
his
heart
overflow
look
here
he
cried
where
are
going
to
get
your
dinner
i
can
get
a
bite
here
as
well
as
anywhere
it
do
matter
much
to
me
replied
the
old
man
come
eat
dinner
with
me
said
bert
i
like
to
have
you
i
afraid
i
could
afford
to
dine
as
you
are
going
to
said
the
man
with
a
smile
his
eyes
twinkling
again
i
pay
for
your
dinner
bert
exclaimed
come
we
do
have
a
thanksgiving
but
once
a
year
and
a
fellow
wants
a
good
time
then
but
you
are
waiting
for
another
boy
oh
hop
houghton
he
wo
come
now
it
too
late
he
gone
to
a
place
down
in
north
street
i
guess
a
place
i
do
like
there
so
much
tobacco
smoked
and
so
much
beer
drank
there
bert
cast
a
final
glance
up
the
street
but
could
see
nothing
of
his
friend
no
he
wo
come
now
so
much
the
worse
for
him
he
likes
the
men
down
there
i
do
ah
said
the
man
taking
off
his
hat
and
giving
it
a
brush
with
his
elbow
as
they
entered
the
restaurant
as
if
trying
to
appear
as
respectable
as
he
could
in
the
eyes
of
a
newsboy
of
such
fastidious
tastes
to
make
him
feel
quite
comfortable
in
his
mind
on
that
point
bert
hastened
to
say
i
mean
rowdies
and
such
poor
people
if
they
behave
themselves
are
just
as
respectable
to
me
as
rich
folks
i
ai
at
all
aristocratic
ah
indeed
and
the
old
man
smiled
again
and
seemed
to
look
relieved
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
he
placed
his
hat
on
the
floor
and
took
a
seat
opposite
bert
at
a
little
table
which
they
had
all
to
themselves
bert
offered
him
the
bill
of
fare
i
must
ask
you
to
choose
for
me
nothing
very
extravagant
you
know
i
am
used
to
plain
fare
so
am
i
but
i
going
to
have
a
dinner
for
once
in
my
life
and
so
are
you
cried
bert
generously
what
do
you
say
to
chicken
soup
and
wind
up
with
a
big
piece
of
squash
pie
how
that
for
a
thanksgiving
dinner
sumptuous
said
the
old
man
appearing
to
glow
with
the
warmth
of
the
room
and
the
prospect
of
a
good
dinner
but
wo
it
cost
you
too
much
too
much
no
sir
said
bert
chicken
soup
fifteen
cents
pie
they
give
tremendous
big
pieces
here
thick
i
tell
you
ten
cents
cents
half
a
dollar
for
two
of
course
i
do
do
this
way
every
day
in
the
year
but
mother
glad
to
have
me
once
in
a
while
here
waiter
and
bert
gave
his
princely
order
as
if
it
were
no
very
great
thing
for
a
liberal
young
fellow
like
him
after
all
where
is
your
mother
why
do
you
take
dinner
with
her
the
little
man
asked
bert
face
grew
sober
in
a
moment
that
the
question
why
do
i
i
tell
you
why
i
do
i
got
the
best
mother
in
the
world
what
i
trying
to
do
is
to
make
a
home
for
her
so
we
can
live
together
and
eat
our
thanksgiving
dinners
together
sometime
some
boys
want
one
thing
some
another
there
one
goes
in
for
good
times
another
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
rich
he
care
much
how
he
does
it
but
what
i
want
most
of
anything
is
to
be
with
my
mother
and
my
two
sisters
again
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
so
bert
eyes
grew
very
tender
and
he
went
on
while
his
companion
across
the
table
watched
him
with
a
very
gentle
searching
look
i
have
been
with
her
now
for
two
years
hardly
at
all
since
father
died
when
his
business
was
settled
up
he
kept
a
little
hosiery
store
on
hanover
street
it
was
found
he
had
left
us
anything
we
had
lived
pretty
well
up
to
that
time
and
i
and
my
two
sisters
had
been
to
school
but
then
mother
had
to
do
something
and
her
friends
got
her
places
to
go
out
nursing
she
a
nurse
now
everybody
likes
her
and
she
has
enough
to
do
we
could
be
with
her
of
course
she
got
us
boarded
at
a
good
place
but
i
saw
how
hard
it
was
going
to
be
for
her
to
support
us
so
i
said
i
a
boy
i
can
do
something
for
myself
you
just
pay
the
board
for
the
girls
and
keep
them
to
school
and
i
go
to
work
and
maybe
help
you
a
little
besides
taking
care
of
myself
what
could
you
do
said
the
little
old
man
that
it
i
was
only
eleven
years
old
and
what
could
i
do
what
i
should
have
liked
would
have
been
some
nice
place
where
i
could
do
light
work
and
stand
a
chance
of
learning
a
good
business
but
beggars
must
be
choosers
i
could
find
such
a
place
and
i
was
going
to
be
loafing
about
the
streets
so
i
went
to
selling
newspapers
i
sold
newspapers
ever
since
and
i
shall
be
twelve
years
old
next
month
you
like
it
said
the
old
man
i
like
to
get
my
own
living
replied
bert
proudly
but
what
i
want
is
to
learn
some
trade
or
regular
business
and
settle
down
and
make
a
home
for
my
mother
but
there
no
use
talking
about
that
well
i
told
you
about
myself
added
bert
now
suppose
tell
something
about
myself
yes
i
think
that
would
go
pretty
well
with
the
pie
but
the
man
shook
his
head
i
could
go
back
and
tell
you
about
many
of
my
plans
and
high
hopes
when
i
was
a
lad
of
your
age
but
it
would
be
too
much
like
your
own
story
over
again
life
is
what
we
think
it
will
be
when
we
are
young
you
find
that
out
soon
enough
i
am
all
alone
in
the
world
now
and
i
am
nearly
seventy
years
old
it
must
be
so
lonely
at
your
age
what
do
you
do
for
a
living
i
have
a
little
place
in
devonshire
street
my
name
is
crooker
find
me
up
two
nights
of
stairs
back
room
at
the
right
come
and
see
me
and
i
tell
you
all
about
my
business
and
perhaps
help
you
to
such
a
place
as
you
want
for
i
know
several
business
men
now
do
fail
and
crooker
wrote
his
address
with
a
little
stub
of
a
pencil
on
a
corner
of
the
newspaper
which
had
led
to
their
acquaintance
tore
it
off
carefully
and
gave
it
to
bert
thereupon
the
latter
took
a
card
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
across
the
table
to
his
new
friend
illustration
herbert
hampton
dealer
in
newspapers
the
old
man
read
the
card
with
his
sharp
gray
eyes
which
glowed
up
funnily
at
bert
seeming
to
say
is
this
rather
aristocratic
for
a
bert
blushed
and
explained
got
up
for
me
by
a
printer
boy
i
know
i
had
done
some
favors
for
him
and
so
he
made
me
a
few
cards
handy
to
have
sometimes
you
know
well
herbert
said
the
old
man
i
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
i
hope
you
come
and
see
me
you
find
me
in
very
humble
quarters
but
you
are
not
aristocratic
you
say
now
wo
you
let
me
pay
for
my
dinner
i
believe
i
have
money
enough
let
me
see
and
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
bert
would
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
but
walked
up
to
the
desk
and
settled
the
bill
with
the
air
of
a
person
who
did
not
regard
a
trifling
expense
when
he
looked
around
again
the
little
old
man
was
gone
now
mind
i
go
and
see
him
the
first
chance
i
have
said
bert
as
he
looked
at
the
penciled
strip
of
newspaper
margin
again
before
putting
it
into
his
pocket
he
then
went
round
to
his
miserable
quarters
in
the
top
of
a
cheap
and
prepared
himself
at
once
to
go
and
see
his
mother
he
could
not
afford
to
ride
and
it
was
a
long
walk
at
least
five
miles
to
the
place
where
his
mother
was
nursing
on
the
following
monday
bert
having
a
leisure
hour
went
to
call
on
his
new
acquaintance
in
devonshire
street
having
climbed
the
two
nights
he
found
the
door
of
the
back
room
at
the
right
ajar
and
looking
in
saw
crooker
at
a
desk
in
the
act
of
receiving
a
roll
of
money
from
a
visitor
bert
entered
unnoticed
and
waited
till
the
money
was
counted
and
a
receipt
signed
then
as
the
visitor
departed
crooker
noticed
the
lad
offered
him
a
chair
and
then
turned
to
place
the
money
in
the
safe
illustration
saw
crooker
receiving
a
roll
of
so
this
is
your
place
of
business
said
bert
glancing
about
the
plain
office
room
what
do
you
do
here
i
buy
real
estate
sometimes
sell
rent
and
so
forth
who
for
asked
bert
for
myself
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
smile
bert
started
perfectly
aghast
at
this
situation
this
then
was
the
man
whom
he
had
invited
to
dinner
and
treated
so
patronizingly
the
preceding
thursday
i
i
i
thought
you
were
a
poor
man
i
am
a
poor
man
said
crooker
locking
his
safe
money
make
a
man
rich
i
money
enough
i
own
houses
in
the
city
they
give
me
something
to
think
of
and
so
keep
me
alive
i
had
truer
riches
once
but
i
lost
them
long
ago
from
the
way
the
old
man
voice
trembled
and
eyes
glistened
bert
thought
he
must
have
meant
by
these
riches
the
friends
he
had
lost
wife
and
children
perhaps
to
think
of
me
inviting
you
to
dinner
he
said
abashed
and
ashamed
it
was
odd
but
it
may
turn
out
to
have
been
a
lucky
circumstance
for
both
of
us
i
like
you
i
believe
in
you
and
i
an
offer
to
make
you
i
want
a
trusty
bright
boy
in
this
office
somebody
i
can
bring
up
to
my
business
and
leave
it
with
as
i
get
too
old
to
attend
to
it
myself
what
do
you
say
what
could
bert
say
again
that
afternoon
he
walked
or
rather
ran
to
his
mother
and
after
consulting
with
her
joyfully
accepted
crooker
offer
interviews
between
his
mother
and
his
employer
followed
the
lonely
childless
old
man
who
owned
so
many
houses
wanted
a
home
and
one
of
these
houses
he
offered
to
hampton
with
ample
support
for
herself
and
children
if
she
would
also
make
it
a
home
for
him
of
course
this
proposition
was
accepted
and
bert
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
great
ambition
of
his
life
accomplished
he
had
employment
which
promised
to
become
a
profitable
business
as
indeed
it
did
in
a
few
years
the
old
man
and
the
lad
proved
useful
to
each
other
and
more
than
that
he
was
united
once
more
with
his
mother
and
sisters
in
a
happy
home
where
he
has
since
had
many
thanksgiving
dinners
illustration
of
these
houses
he
offered
to
mrs
illustration
the
boy
and
his
spare
moments
a
lean
awkward
boy
came
one
morning
to
the
door
of
the
principal
of
a
celebrated
school
and
asked
to
see
him
the
servant
eyed
his
mean
clothes
and
thinking
he
looked
more
like
a
beggar
than
anything
else
told
him
to
go
around
to
the
kitchen
the
boy
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
soon
appeared
at
the
back
door
i
should
like
to
see
brown
said
he
you
want
a
breakfast
more
like
said
the
servant
girl
and
i
can
give
you
that
without
troubling
him
thank
you
said
the
boy
i
should
have
no
objection
to
a
bit
of
bread
but
i
should
like
to
see
brown
if
he
can
see
me
some
old
clothes
may
be
you
want
remarked
the
servant
again
eyeing
the
boy
patched
trousers
i
guess
he
has
none
to
spare
he
gives
away
a
sight
and
without
minding
the
boy
request
she
set
out
some
food
upon
the
kitchen
table
and
went
about
her
work
can
i
see
mr
brown
again
asked
the
boy
after
finishing
his
meal
well
he
in
the
library
if
he
must
be
disturbed
he
must
but
he
does
like
to
be
alone
sometimes
said
the
girl
in
a
peevish
tone
she
seemed
to
think
it
very
foolish
to
admit
such
an
fellow
into
her
master
presence
however
she
wiped
her
hands
and
bade
him
follow
opening
the
library
door
she
said
here
somebody
sir
who
is
dreadfully
anxious
to
see
you
and
so
i
let
him
in
i
do
know
how
the
boy
introduced
himself
or
how
he
opened
his
business
but
i
know
that
after
talking
awhile
the
principal
put
aside
the
volume
he
was
studying
took
up
some
greek
books
and
began
to
examine
the
the
examination
lasted
some
time
every
question
which
the
principal
asked
the
boy
answered
as
readily
as
could
be
upon
my
word
exclaimed
the
principal
you
certainly
do
well
looking
at
the
boy
from
head
to
foot
over
his
spectacles
why
my
boy
where
did
you
pick
up
so
much
my
spare
moments
answered
the
boy
here
he
was
poor
with
but
few
opportunities
for
schooling
yet
almost
fitted
for
college
by
simply
improving
his
truly
are
not
spare
moments
the
gold
dust
of
time
how
precious
they
should
be
what
account
can
you
give
of
your
spare
moments
what
can
you
show
for
them
look
and
see
illustration
did
you
pick
up
so
much
in
my
spare
this
boy
can
tell
you
how
very
much
can
be
laid
up
by
improving
them
and
there
are
other
boys

am
afraid
in
the
jail
in
the
house
of
correction
in
the
forecastle
of
a
whale
ship
in
the
gambling
house
or
in
the
tippling
shop
who
if
you
should
ask
them
when
they
began
their
sinful
courses
might
answer
in
my
moments
in
my
spare
moments
i
gambled
for
marbles
in
my
spare
moments
i
began
to
smoke
and
drink
it
was
in
my
spare
moments
that
i
began
to
steal
chestnuts
from
the
old
woman
stand
it
was
in
my
spare
moments
that
i
gathered
with
wicked
associates
oh
be
very
very
careful
how
you
spend
your
spare
moments

always
hunts
you
out
in
small
seasons
like
these
when
you
are
not
busy

gets
into
your

if
he
possibly
can
in

such
gaps

he

would
say
to
his
mother
you
will
crush
all
the
manhood
in
him
and
so
he
grew
up
the
terror
of
his
neighbors
the
old
the
infirm
and
the
crippled
were
the
especial
objects
of
his
vicious
merriment
one
poor
woman
bent
by
age
and
infirmities
he
assailed
with
his
ridicule
as
she
daily
went
out
upon
her
crutch
to
draw
water
from
the
well
near
her
house
and
just
within
the
playground
of
the
schoolhouse

at
her

would
say

she

an
extra
crook
in

his
cruel
laugh
as
he
followed
closely
behind
mocking
and
mimicking

forth
from
her
no
rebuke
one
day
however
she
turned
and
looking
at

reproachfully

charles

to
laugh
at
her
misfortunes
i
heard
my
grandmother
say
that
she
became
a
cripple
by
lifting
her
invalid
son
and
tending
him
night
and
day
i
do
care
what
made
her
so

if
i
was
such
a
looking
thing
as
that

said
charles
shame
echoed
each
of
the
boys
present
and
to
show
their
sympathy
several
of
them
sprang
forward
to
aid
the
poor
woman
but
charles
mansfield
the
oldest
and
always
an
example
of
nobleness
and
generosity
was
the
first
let
me
get
the
water
for
you
and
he
gently
took
the
bucket
from
her
hand
her
voice
was
tremulous
and
tearful
as
she
said
thank
you
my
dear
boy
god
grant
that
you
may
never
suffer
from
such
infirmities
if
i
should
said
charles
kindly
it
would
be
the
duty
and
ought
to
be
the
pleasure
of
young
people
to
assist
me
one
of
us
will
bring
you
water
every
day
and
so
you
need
not
come
for
it
yes
so
we
will
was
echoed
from
lip
to
lip
god
bless
you

bless
you

exclaimed
as
she
wiped
away
the
tears
and
entered

and
lonely
home
will
winslow
was
reported
to
the
master
and
was
sentenced
to
study
during
the
usual
recess
for
a
week
to
come
the
punishment
was
hard
for
he
loved
play
better
than
his
book
but
how
slight
in
comparison
with
the
retribution
which
awaited
him
it
was
the
second
day
of
his
confinement
and
he
sat
near
the
open
window
watching
the
sports
of
the
boys
in
the
playground
suddenly
when
the
master
was
absorbed
in
his
occupations
he
leaped
into
the
midst
of
them
with
a
shout
at
his
achievement
illustration
there
was
a
heavy
plunge
and
a
groan
now
let
him
punish
me
again
if
he
can
and
he
ran
backward
throwing
up
his
arms
and
shouting
in
defiance
when
his
voice
suddenly
ceased
there
was
a
heavy
plunge
and
a
horrible
groan
broke
on
the
ears
of
his
bewildered
companions
now
it
happened
that
the
well
of
which
we
have
before
spoken
was
undergoing
repairs
and
the
workmen
were
then
at
a
distance
collecting
their
materials
carelessly
the
well
was
left
uncovered
and
at
the
very
moment
of
his
triumph
will
winslow
was
precipitated
backward
into
the
opening
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
the
assembled
boys
who
rushed
to
the
spot
and
charles
mansfield
the
bravest
of
them
all
was
the
first
to
seize
the
tie
it
around
his
waist
and
descend
to
the
rescue
the
well
was
deep
fortunately
however
the
water
at
that
time
was
mostly
exhausted
but
will
lay
motionless
at
the
bottom
carefully
charles
lifted
him
and
with
one
arm
around
his
mutilated
and
apparently
lifeless
form
and
the
other
upon
the
rope
he
gave
the
signal
and
was
slowly
drawn
to
the
top
the
livid
face
of
the
wicked
boy
filled
his
companions
with
horror
and
in
perfect
silence
they
bore
him
to
the
house
of
the
poor
woman
which
was
close
at
hand
she
had
witnessed
the
accident
from
the
window
and
upon
her
crutch
hastened
to
meet
them
and
now
will
winslow
was
in
the
humble
home
and
upon
the
lowly
bed
of
her
whom
he
had
assailed
with
cruelty
and
scorn
and
faithfully
she
obeyed
the
commandment
of
him
who
said
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
silently
her
prayers
ascended
to
god
for
the
sufferer
her
little
vials
of
camphor
and
other
restoratives
provided
by
charitable
neighbors
were
emptied
for
his
relief
she
took
from
her
scanty
store
bandages
for
his
head
which
was
shockingly
mangled
and
bleeding
and
she
herself
forgetful
of
all
but
his
sufferings
sat
down
and
tenderly
bathed
his
hands
and
his
forehead
while
some
of
the
boys
ran
for
the
surgeon
and
others
for
the
master
the
injury
to
the
head
was
supposed
to
be
the
only
one
he
had
sustained
and
after
the
surgeon
had
done
his
work
the
poor
boy
was
borne
away
on
a
litter
to
his
home
still
insensible
and
surrounded
by
his
companions
mute
with
emotion
that
day
was
destined
to
make
an
impression
upon
the
school
its
master
and
all
that
heard
of
the
awful
catastrophe
a
few
hours
later
and
a
group
of
boys
collected
in
the
playground
their
conversation
was
in
whispers
horror
sat
upon
every
face
all
were
pale
and
awe
stricken
charles
mansfield
approached
how
is
poor
will
now
have
you
heard
oh
charlie
several
exclaimed
at
once
as
they
gathered
around
him
oh
do
you
know
have
you
heard
why
he
opened
his
eyes
and
spoke
but
they
think
his
back
is
broken
charles
clasped
his
hands
lifted
them
high
in
the
air
uttered
not
a
word
but
burst
into
tears
for
a
few
minutes
he
wept
in
silence
and
then
still
pale
and
grief
stricken
but
with
a
manly
voice
he
said
to
his
companions
boys
shall
we
ever
forget
the
lesson
of
this
day
and
poor
will
words
would
be
too
feeble
to
portray
his
agony
of
body
and
mind
as
he
lay
for
long
months
upon
his
bed
of
suffering
but
when
he
arose
therefrom
with
a
feeble
and
distorted
body
and
a
scar
upon
his
forehead
he
was
changed
in
heart
also
crushed
in
spirit
humble
and
contrite
repentance
had
had
its
perfect
work
and
when
he
became
convalescent
and
his
schoolmates
came
to
congratulate
him
on
his
recovery
he
threw
his
arms
around
the
necks
of
each
and
burst
into
tears
but
could
not
speak
except
to
whisper

soon
as

could
do

he
wrote
to
her
humbly
pleading
her
forgiveness

in
return

gave
him

blessing

this
time

ample
quarterly
allowance

given

in
her
loneliness

this
once

in
again
very
soon
mother
i
am
only
going
the
corner
to
see
the
new
billiard
rooms
and
cap
in
hand
harry
was
closing
the
parlor
door
when
his
mother
called
him
back
i
can
not
consent
to
your
going
there
my
dear
she
said
you
must
know
that
both
your
father
and
myself
disapprove
of
all
such
places
but
i
do
intend
to
play
mother
only
to
look
on
the
boys
say
the
tables
are
splendid
and
besides
what
could
i
tell
jim
ward
after
promising
to
go
with
him
he
is
waiting
outside
for
me
please
say
only
this
once
tell
jim
that
we
rather
you
would
remain
at
home
and
ask
him
to
walk
in
and
spend
the
evening
said
harry
father
as
he
looked
up
from
the
paper
oh
i
know
he
not
do
that
and
harry
stood
turning
the
door
handle
till
finding
that
his
parents
did
not
intend
to
say
anything
more
he
walked
slowly
to
the
front
step
why
do
you
hurry
along
called
jim
and
not
keep
a
fellow
standing
all
night
in
the
cold
i
am
not
going
wo
you
come
in
said
harry
not
going
your
mother
surely
does
object
to
your
looking
at
a
billiard
table
she
would
prefer
i
should
not
go
said
harry
and
jim
only
reply
was
a
significant
whistle
as
he
walked
off
illustration
i
wonder
if
my
son
feels
too
old
for
a
story
he
be
sure
to
tell
all
the
boys
said
harry
half
aloud
as
he
shut
the
front
door
with
rather
more
force
than
was
necessary
i
do
see
what
does
make
father
and
mother
so
particular
then
entering
the
parlor
he
took
the
first
book
that
came
to
hand
from
the
table
and
taking
a
seat
very
far
from
the
light
looked
exceedingly
unamiable
his
father
laid
aside
the
paper
and
without
seeming
to
notice
mood
said
pleasantly
i
wonder
if
my
son
feels
himself
too
old
for
a
story
if
not
i
have
one
to
tell
him
which
might
well
be
named
this
once
the
book
was
returned
to
the
table
but
harry
still
kept
thinking
of
what
the
boys
would
say
when
jim
told
an
exaggerated
story
and
his
countenance
remained
unchanged
when
i
was
about
your
age
harry
began
his
father
we
lived
next
door
to
allen
a
very
wealthy
gentleman
who
had
one
son
as
frank
was
a
merry
boy
and
had
his
two
beautiful
ponies
several
dogs
and
a
large
playground
he
soon
made
friends
many
an
afternoon
did
we
spend
together
riding
the
ponies
or
playing
ball
on
the
playground
and
one
summer
afternoon
in
particular
i
never
expect
to
forget
for
it
seems
to
me
now
looking
back
upon
it
as
the
turning
point
of
frank
life
but
we
little
thought
of
such
a
thing
at
the
time
it
was
a
very
warm
afternoon
and
becoming
tired
of
playing
ball
we
had
stopped
to
rest
on
the
piazza
when
frank
proposed
that
we
should
take
the
ponies
to
a
plank
road
a
few
miles
from
the
house
and
race
them
i
was
certain
that
his
father
would
disapprove
of
this
and
besides
it
would
have
been
most
cruel
work
on
such
a
warm
afternoon
so
i
tried
to
make
frank
think
of
something
else
he
would
like
to
do
instead
but
all
in
vain
think
you
might
go
charlie
he
said
the
harm
of
doing
it
this
i
just
want
to
see
if
either
of
my
ponies
is
likely
to
be
a
fast
trotter
for
one
moment
i
hesitated
but
in
the
next
came
the
thought
of
my
father
displeasure
and
i
shook
my
head
well
just
as
you
please
good
boy
i
know
plenty
who
will
be
glad
of
the
chance
to
ride
jet
and
so
saying
he
walked
away
frank
did
find
a
boy
who
was
delighted
to
go
with
him
and
enjoyed
the
race
so
much
that
notwithstanding
his
father
reprimand
he
managed
to
pursue
the
same
sport
more
times
than
that
once
as
soon
as
the
summer
was
ended
allen
went
to
europe
for
his
health
and
i
did
not
see
his
son
again
for
three
years
till
i
left
the
country
and
entered
the
same
college
with
him
frank
began
studying
very
earnestly
but
before
the
first
year
was
ended
the
earnestness
had
passed
away
friends
would
induce
him
to
spend
his
evenings
at
their
rooms
or
at
some
public
place
of
amusement
and
each
time
frank
would
try
to
satisfy
his
conscience
with
will
be
only
this
once
illustration
this
thus
by
degrees
his
lessons
were
neglected
and
as
study
became
irksome
his
love
for
excitement
and
gaiety
increased
till
one
day
i
overheard
a
gentleman
who
knew
him
well
remark
that
he
feared
this
once
would
prove
his
ruin
but
a
few
years
before
frank
would
have
been
shocked
with
the
thought
of
spending
the
afternoons
in
racing
and
evenings
in
billiard
saloons
he
had
not
at
first
really
intended
to
visit
these
places
more
than
to
see
for
myself
but
there
are
very
few
who
ever
stop
in
the
course
of
wrong
doing
at
this
once
at
length
his
father
died
when
the
sad
tidings
reached
the
son
he
seemed
more
thoughtful
for
a
time
but
in
an
hour
of
temptation
he
yielded
before
long
his
old
companions
surrounded
him
again
and
of
them
he
soon
learned
how
to
spend
the
large
fortune
left
him
by
his
father
in
a
most
reckless
manner
in
vain
his
true
friends
tried
to
check
him
in
his
wild
career
and
five
years
ago
harry
my
poor
friend
frank
died
a
drunkard
oh
father
how
dreadful
and
harry
shuddered
yes
it
is
dreadful
my
son
but
there
are
countless
untold
stories
as
dreadful
as
this
one
if
we
were
to
visit
a
prison
and
ask
the
wretched
inmates
how
it
was
that
they
were
first
led
into
crime
we
should
find
that
this
brought
most
of
them
there
one
took
something
which
did
not
belong
to
him
never
intending
to
do
it
more
than
that
once
but
the
crime
soon
grew
into
a
habit
another
was
once
tempted
to
gamble
and
only
that
one
game
was
the
foundation
of
all
his
crimes
another
fully
intended
to
stop
with
the
first
glass
but
instead
became
a
reckless
drunkard
learn
my
son
to
dread
those
three
little
words
and
when
tempted
to
use
them
think
of
all
they
may
lead
to
and
ask
for
strength
to
resist
the
temptation
and
harry
do
you
wonder
now
at
our
refusing
to
allow
you
to
visit
the
billiard
room
even
once
no
father
i
see
now
that
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
in
supposing
that
it
could
not
possibly
do
me
any
harm
to
go
only
this
once
and
if
jim
tell
the
boys
some
silly
story
to
make
them
laugh
at
me
i
can
tell
them
about
frank
allen
and
that
will
soon
sober
them
my
dear
boys
do
you
flatter
yourself
that
it
is
a
trifling
thing
to
do
wrong
only
this
once
if
so
stop
and
consider
how
often
not
only
the
young
but
those
of
mature
years
yield
to
this
deceptive
and
alluring
thought
and
take
the
first
steps
in
a
career
of
sin
when
could
they
but
see
the
end
of
the
path
which
they
are
so
thoughtlessly
entering
they
would
shudder
with
horror
they
do
not
realize
that
sin
once
indulged
in
hardens
the
heart
and
that
one
step
in
the
downward
path
leads
to
the
broad
road
how
many
parents
yield
to
the
pleadings
of
their
children
to
be
indulged
this
once
who
find
that
to
deny
after
once
being
indulged
costs
a
greater
effort
than
to
have
stood
with
firmness
to
conviction
of
conscience
and
true
principle
illustration
the
right
decision
it
was
the
beginning
of
vacation
when
davis
a
friend
of
my
father
came
to
see
us
and
asked
to
let
me
go
home
with
him
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
thought
of
going
out
of
town
the
journey
was
delightful
and
when
we
reached
davis
house
everything
looked
as
if
i
were
going
to
have
a
fine
time
fred
davis
a
boy
about
my
own
age
took
me
cordially
by
the
hand
and
all
the
family
soon
seemed
like
old
friends
this
is
going
to
be
a
vacation
worth
having
i
said
to
myself
several
times
during
the
evening
as
we
all
played
games
told
riddles
and
laughed
and
chatted
merrily
at
last
davis
said
it
was
almost
bedtime
then
i
expected
family
prayers
but
we
were
very
soon
directed
to
our
chambers
how
strange
it
seemed
to
me
for
i
had
never
before
been
in
a
household
without
the
family
altar
come
said
fred
mother
says
you
and
i
are
going
to
be
bed
fellows
and
i
followed
him
up
two
pair
of
stairs
to
a
nice
little
chamber
which
he
called
his
room
he
opened
a
drawer
and
showed
me
a
box
and
boat
and
knives
and
powderhorn
and
all
his
treasures
and
told
me
a
world
of
new
things
about
what
the
boys
did
there
then
he
undressed
first
and
jumped
into
bed
i
was
much
longer
about
it
for
a
new
set
of
thoughts
began
to
rise
in
my
mind
when
my
mother
put
my
purse
into
my
hand
just
before
the
train
started
she
said
tenderly
in
a
low
tone
remember
robert
that
you
are
a
christian
boy
i
knew
very
well
what
that
meant
and
i
had
now
just
come
to
a
point
of
time
when
her
words
were
to
be
minded
at
home
i
was
taught
the
duties
of
a
christian
child
abroad
i
must
not
neglect
them
and
one
of
these
was
evening
prayer
from
a
very
little
boy
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
kneeling
and
asking
the
forgiveness
of
god
for
jesus
sake
acknowledging
his
mercies
and
seeking
his
protection
and
blessing
why
do
you
come
to
bed
robert
cried
fred
what
are
you
sitting
there
for
i
was
afraid
to
pray
and
afraid
not
to
pray
it
seemed
that
i
could
not
kneel
down
and
pray
before
fred
what
would
he
say
would
he
not
laugh
the
fear
of
fred
made
me
a
coward
yet
i
could
not
lie
down
on
a
prayerless
bed
if
i
needed
the
protection
of
my
heavenly
father
at
home
how
much
more
abroad
i
wished
many
wishes
that
i
had
slept
alone
that
fred
would
go
to
sleep
or
something
else
i
hardly
knew
what
but
fred
would
not
go
to
sleep
perhaps
struggles
like
these
take
place
in
the
bosom
of
every
boy
when
he
leaves
home
and
begins
to
act
for
himself
and
on
his
decision
may
depend
his
character
for
time
and
for
eternity
with
me
the
struggle
was
severe
illustration
will
kneel
down
and
pray
at
last
to
fred
cry
come
boy
come
to
bed
i
mustered
courage
to
say
i
will
kneel
down
and
pray
first
that
is
always
my
custom
pray
said
fred
turning
himself
over
on
his
pillow
and
saying
no
more
his
propriety
of
conduct
made
me
ashamed
here
i
had
long
been
afraid
of
him
and
yet
when
he
knew
my
wishes
he
was
quiet
and
left
me
to
myself
how
thankful
i
was
that
duty
and
conscience
triumphed
that
settled
my
future
course
it
gave
me
strength
for
time
to
come
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
christian
boy
by
god
blessing
made
me
a
christian
man
for
in
after
years
i
was
thrown
amid
trials
and
temptations
which
must
have
drawn
me
away
from
god
and
from
virtue
had
it
not
been
for
my
settled
habit
of
secret
prayer
let
every
boy
who
has
pious
parents
read
and
think
about
this
you
have
been
trained
in
christian
duties
and
principles
when
you
go
from
home
do
not
leave
them
behind
carry
them
with
you
and
stand
by
them
then
in
weakness
and
temptation
by
the
help
of
god
they
will
stand
by
you
take
your
place
like
a
man
on
the
side
of
your
god
and
saviour
of
your
mother
god
and
saviour
and
of
your
father
god
it
is
by
a
failure
to
do
this
that
so
many
boys
go
astray
and
grow
up
to
be
young
men
dishonoring
their
parents
without
hope
and
without
god
in
the
world
ashamed
of
jesus
that
dear
friend
on
whom
my
hopes
of
heaven
depend
no
when
i
blush
be
this
my
shame
that
i
no
more
revere
his
name
ashamed
of
jesus
yes
i
may
when
i
no
guilt
to
wash
away
no
tears
to
wipe
no
good
to
crave
no
fears
to
quell
no
soul
to
save
illustration
closed
his
book
and
began
playing
with
some
the
use
of
learning
i
am
tired
of
going
to
school
said
herbert
allen
to
william
wheeler
the
boy
who
sat
next
to
him
i
do
see
any
great
use
for
my
part
in
studying
geometry
and
navigation
and
surveying
and
mensuration
and
the
dozen
other
things
that
i
am
expected
to
learn
they
will
never
do
me
any
good
i
am
not
going
to
get
my
living
as
a
surveyor
or
measurer
or
sea
captain
how
are
you
going
to
get
your
living
herbert
his
young
friend
asked
in
a
quiet
tone
as
he
looked
up
into
his
face
why
i
am
going
to
learn
a
trade
or
at
least
my
father
says
that
i
am
and
so
am
i
replied
william
and
yet
my
father
wishes
me
to
learn
everything
that
i
can
for
he
says
that
it
will
all
be
useful
some
time
or
other
in
my
life
i
sure
i
ca
see
what
use
i
am
ever
going
to
make
as
a
saddler
of
algebra
or
surveying
still
if
we
ca
see
it
herbert
perhaps
our
fathers
can
for
they
are
older
and
wiser
than
we
are
and
we
ought
to
try
to
learn
simply
because
they
wish
us
to
even
if
we
do
not
see
clearly
the
use
in
everything
that
we
are
expected
to
study
i
ca
feel
so
herbert
replied
tossing
his
head
and
i
believe
that
my
father
sees
any
more
clearly
than
i
do
the
use
of
all
this
you
are
wrong
to
talk
so
protested
his
friend
in
a
serious
tone
i
would
not
think
as
you
do
for
the
world
my
father
knows
what
is
best
for
me
and
your
father
knows
what
is
best
for
you
and
if
we
do
not
study
and
improve
our
time
we
will
surely
go
wrong
i
am
not
afraid
responded
herbert
closing
the
book
which
he
had
been
reluctantly
studying
for
half
an
hour
in
the
vain
effort
to
fix
a
lesson
on
his
unwilling
memory
then
taking
some
marbles
from
his
pocket
he
began
to
amuse
himself
with
them
at
the
same
time
concealing
them
from
the
teacher
william
said
no
more
but
turned
to
his
lesson
with
an
earnest
attention
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
two
boys
is
plainly
indicated
in
this
brief
conversation
to
their
teacher
it
was
evident
in
numerous
particulars
in
their
conduct
their
habits
and
their
manners
william
always
recited
his
lessons
correctly
while
herbert
never
learned
a
lesson
well
one
was
always
punctual
at
school
the
other
a
loiterer
by
the
way
william
books
were
well
taken
care
of
were
soiled
torn
disfigured
and
broken
thus
they
began
life
the
one
obedient
industrious
attentive
to
the
precepts
of
those
who
were
older
and
wiser
and
willing
to
be
guided
by
them
the
other
indolent
and
inclined
to
follow
the
leadings
of
his
own
will
now
at
the
age
of
wheeler
is
an
intelligent
merchant
in
an
active
business
while
allen
is
a
journeyman
mechanic
poor
in
embarrassed
circumstances
and
possessing
but
a
small
share
of
general
information
illustration
contrast
in
their
appearance
was
very
how
do
you
do
my
old
friend
said
the
merchant
to
the
mechanic
about
this
time
as
the
latter
entered
the
counting
room
of
the
former
the
contrast
in
their
appearance
was
very
great
the
merchant
was
well
dressed
and
had
a
cheerful
look
while
the
other
was
poorly
clad
and
seemed
troubled
and
dejected
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
very
well
wheeler
the
mechanic
replied
in
a
tone
of
despondency
work
is
very
dull
and
wages
low
and
with
so
large
a
family
as
i
have
it
is
tough
enough
getting
along
under
the
best
circumstances
i
am
really
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
replied
the
merchant
in
a
kind
tone
how
much
can
you
earn
now
if
i
had
steady
work
i
could
make
twelve
or
fifteen
dollars
a
week
but
our
business
is
very
bad
the
consequence
is
that
i
do
not
average
nine
dollars
a
week
the
year
round
how
large
is
your
family
i
have
five
children
sir
five
children
and
only
nine
dollars
a
week
that
is
all
sir
but
nine
dollars
a
week
will
not
support
them
and
i
am
in
consequence
going
behindhand
you
ought
to
try
to
get
into
some
other
business
but
i
do
know
any
other
the
merchant
mused
awhile
and
then
said
perhaps
i
can
aid
you
into
getting
into
something
better
i
am
president
of
a
railroad
and
we
are
about
putting
on
the
line
a
company
of
engineers
for
the
purpose
of
surveying
and
locating
the
route
you
studied
surveying
and
engineering
at
the
same
time
i
did
and
i
suppose
have
still
a
correct
knowledge
of
both
if
so
i
will
use
my
influence
to
have
you
appointed
surveyor
the
engineer
is
already
chosen
and
you
shall
have
time
to
revive
your
early
knowledge
of
these
matters
the
salary
is
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
a
shadow
still
darker
than
that
which
had
before
rested
there
fell
upon
the
face
of
the
mechanic
but
he
said
i
have
not
the
slightest
knowledge
of
surveying
it
is
true
i
studied
it
or
rather
pretended
to
study
it
at
school
but
it
made
no
permanent
impression
on
my
mind
i
saw
no
use
in
it
then
and
am
now
as
ignorant
of
surveying
as
if
i
had
never
taken
a
lesson
on
the
subject
i
am
sorry
my
old
friend
replied
the
merchant
but
you
are
a
good
accountant
i
suppose
and
i
might
perhaps
get
you
into
a
store
what
is
your
capacity
in
this
respect
i
ought
to
have
been
a
good
accountant
for
i
studied
mathematics
long
enough
but
i
took
little
interest
in
figures
and
now
although
i
was
for
many
months
while
at
school
pretending
to
study
bookkeeping
i
am
utterly
incapable
of
taking
charge
of
a
set
of
books
such
being
the
case
allen
i
really
do
not
know
what
i
can
do
for
you
but
stay
i
am
about
sending
an
assorted
cargo
to
buenos
ayres
and
thence
to
callao
and
want
a
man
to
go
as
supercargo
who
can
speak
the
spanish
language
the
captain
will
direct
the
sales
i
remember
that
we
studied
spanish
together
would
you
be
willing
to
leave
your
family
and
go
the
wages
will
be
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
i
have
forgotten
all
my
spanish
sir
i
did
not
see
the
use
of
it
while
at
school
and
therefore
it
made
no
impression
upon
my
mind
after
thinking
a
moment
the
merchant
replied
i
can
think
of
but
one
thing
that
you
can
do
allen
and
that
will
not
be
much
better
than
your
present
employment
it
is
a
service
for
which
ordinary
laborers
are
employed
that
of
chain
carrying
for
the
surveyor
to
the
proposed
railroad
expedition
what
are
the
wages
sir
forty
dollars
a
month
and
found
certainly
i
will
accept
it
sir
thankfully
the
man
said
it
will
be
much
better
than
my
present
employment
then
make
yourself
ready
at
once
for
the
company
will
start
in
a
week
i
will
be
ready
sir
the
poor
man
replied
and
then
withdrew
in
a
week
the
company
of
engineers
started
and
allen
with
them
as
a
chain
carrier
when
had
he
as
a
boy
taken
the
advice
of
his
parents
and
friends
and
stored
his
mind
with
useful
knowledge
he
might
have
filled
the
surveyor
office
at
more
than
double
the
wages
paid
to
him
as
chain
carrier
indeed
we
can
not
tell
how
high
a
position
of
usefulness
and
profit
he
might
have
held
had
he
improved
all
the
opportunities
afforded
him
in
youth
but
he
perceived
the
use
and
value
of
learning
when
it
was
too
late
i
hope
that
none
of
my
young
readers
will
make
the
same
discovery
that
allen
did
when
it
is
too
late
to
reap
any
real
benefit
children
and
youth
can
not
possibly
know
as
well
as
their
parents
guardians
and
teachers
what
is
best
for
them
they
should
therefore
be
obedient
and
willing
to
learn
even
if
they
can
not
see
of
what
use
learning
will
be
to
them

jamie
and
his
teacher
among
the
scholars
in
a
mission
sabbath
school
formed
in
one
of
our
large
country
villages
was
a
little
irish
boy
whose
bright
intelligent
face
quickness
of
mind
and
earnest
attention
to
the
lessons
had
awakened
great
interest
in
the
mind
of
his
teacher
after
a
few
sabbaths
however
this
boy
was
missing
and
when
sought
by
the
visiting
committee
during
the
week
was
never
to
be
found
sometimes
he
was
seen
from
a
distance
looking
with
apparent
interest
as
the
superintendent
or
one
of
the
teachers
passed
by
but
if
they
attempted
to
approach
him
he
would
take
to
his
heels
and
spring
over
walls
and
fences
with
such
agility
that
there
was
no
hope
of
overtaking
him
miss
his
teacher
in
the
sabbath
school
was
a
young
lady
belonging
to
one
of
the
wealthiest
families
in
the
village
one
cold
afternoon
in
december
after
jamie
had
been
absent
from
his
class
more
than
a
month
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
back
door
of
her
father
house
asking
to
see
her
no
no
said
the
cook
ye
need
be
thinking
the
young
leddy
come
in
the
woodshed
to
see
ye
if
ye
have
any
message
ye
can
go
in
the
house
i
do
look
nice
enough
to
go
in
said
jamie
glancing
ruefully
at
his
torn
trousers
and
coarse
muddy
boots
but
it
so
happened
that
miss
was
passing
through
the
hall
and
she
heard
and
recognized
the
voice
at
once
so
she
came
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
wanted
jamie
hung
his
head
in
confusion
while
the
young
lady
kindly
took
his
hand
in
hers
and
asked
if
he
had
been
well
and
why
he
had
not
been
to
sabbath
school
me
father
would
let
me
come
he
sobbed
out
at
last
he
bate
me
because
i
been
to
the
sabbath
school
poor
child
exclaimed
miss
but
does
your
father
know
you
came
here
this
afternoon
no
but
he
said
i
might
have
every
half
holiday
to
go
skating
if
i
promised
never
to
go
inside
the
sabbath
school
again
so
i
brought
me
testament
and
i
thought
mebbe
you
teach
me
here
was
it
not
a
bold
request
did
not
jamie
know
that
with
home
duties
and
the
claims
of
social
life
his
teacher
time
must
be
fully
occupied
might
she
not
think
that
her
services
on
the
sabbath
were
all
that
should
be
required
of
her
ah
no
what
were
time
and
strength
and
fashionable
amusements
to
be
compared
with
the
value
of
a
precious
soul
miss
could
only
thank
god
for
so
rich
a
privilege
and
enter
with
joy
upon
the
work
of
instruction
so
every
half
holiday
found
jamie
seated
by
her
side
in
the
beautiful
library
earnestly
studying
the
words
of
the
master
who
has
said
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
came
and
went
the
last
ice
had
melted
from
the
pond
but
never
once
had
jamie
gone
skating
he
had
found
a
source
of
better
deeper
delight
than
even
boyish
sports
could
afford
but
jamie
could
not
always
hide
the
fact
that
he
was
spending
his
time
in
this
way
illustration
me
testament
one
day
his
testament
fell
from
his
pocket
in
the
presence
of
his
parents
what
that
demanded
the
father
fiercely
it
me
testament
father
jamie
gently
replied
and
where
did
ye
get
that
have
ye
been
to
the
sabbath
school
since
i
told
ye
not
no
father
but
my
teacher
gave
me
this
a
great
while
ago
and
who
is
your
teacher
miss
what
miss
the
one
that
lives
in
that
splendid
house
on
the
hill
yes
father
well
well
what
in
the
book
let
hear
a
bit
illustration
in
the
book
let
hear
a
providentially
this
was
one
of
the
rare
occasions
when
ryan
was
not
intoxicated
and
as
the
boy
read
passage
after
passage
from
his
beloved
book
the
father
mind
opened
with
a
interest
to
the
truths
of
the
holy
word
from
that
day
he
became
a
sincere
inquirer
after
the
truth
as
it
is
in
jesus
the
appetite
for
strong
drink
which
had
been
the
cause
of
his
degradation
was
at
last
quenched
for
a
stronger
thirst
had
taken
possession
of
his
soul
even
for
that
purifying
stream
of
which
whosoever
drinketh
shall
never
thirst
when
sober
ryan
was
an
industrious
and
intelligent
man
and
by
his
renewed
energies
his
family
was
soon
placed
in
a
position
of
comfort
and
respectability
but
that
was
not
all
the
good
effect
of
jamie
love
for
the
truth
within
a
few
months
both
father
and
mother
had
cast
off
the
fetters
of
restraint
and
were
receiving
for
themselves
with
meekness
and
earnestness
that
precious
word
which
was
able
to
save
their
souls
had
not
jamie
made
the
very
best
use
of
his
winter
holidays
and
was
not
his
teacher
richly
rewarded
for
all
her
exertions
how
many
of
our
young
readers
will
study
with
equal
earnestness
the
word
of
truth
which
is
always
open
to
them
that
they
may
learn
from
it
the
way
of
life
how
many
christian
teachers
will
engage
with
equal
interest
in
the
work
of
instruction
in
the
hope
that
in
so
doing
they
may
save
a
soul
from
death
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
and
of
god
who
brought
the
news
of
pardon
down
and
bought
it
with
his
blood
to
christ
the
anointed
king
be
endless
blessings
given
let
the
whole
earth
his
glories
sing
who
made

illustration
with
a
will
joe
it
was
a
summer
afternoon
the
wheelbarrow
stood
before
door
the
street
was
empty
of
all
traffic
for
the
heat
was
intense
i
sauntered
languidly
along
on
the
shady
side
opposite
the
house
and
noticed
her
boy
bringing
out
some
linen
in
a
basket
to
put
on
the
wheelbarrow
i
was
surprised
at
the
size
of
the
basket
he
was
lugging
along
the
passage
and
lifting
on
to
the
wheelbarrow
and
paused
to
look
at
him
he
pulled
and
dragged
and
then
resting
a
moment
began
again
and
in
the
silence
of
the
street
i
heard
him
saying
something
to
himself
i
half
crossed
the
road
he
was
too
busy
to
notice
me
and
then
in
a
pause
of
his
toil
i
heard
him
gasp
out
with
a
will
joe
he
was
encouraging
himself
to
a
further
effort
with
these
words
at
last
bringing
the
large
basket
to
the
curbstone
he
ran
in
and
got
a
piece
of
smooth
wood
as
a
lever
resting
one
end
of
the
basket
on
the
wheelbarrow
he
heaved
up
the
other
end
and
saying
a
little
louder
than
before
with
a
will
joe
the
basket
was
mounted
on
to
the
wheelbarrow
illustration
i
managed
it
mother
as
he
rested
and
looked
proudly
at
his
successful
effort
he
saw
me
and
his
round
red
face
covered
with
perspiration
became
scarlet
for
a
moment
as
i
said
that
a
brave
boy
the
mother
voice
sounded
in
the
passage
i
coming
joe
and
out
she
came
as
the
child
pointing
to
the
basket
exclaimed
i
managed
it
mother
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
gratified
smile
of
the
widowed
mother
as
she
fondly
regarded
her
willing
boy
though
no
further
word
was
spoken
the
expression
of
satisfaction
on
their
faces
was
very
plain
and
i
have
no
doubt
in
each
heart
there
was
a
throb
of
pleasure
for
which
words
have
no
language
i
went
on
my
way
but
the
saying
with
a
will
joe
went
with
me
how
much
there
was
in
that
simple
phrase
with
a
will
how
different
is
our
work
according
as
we
do
it
with
or
against
our
will
this
little
fellow
might
have
cried
or
murmured
or
left
his
mother
to
do
the
work
and
been
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
a
source
of
discontent
to
his
mother
but
he
had
spurred
himself
on
to
toil
and
duty
with
his
words
powerful
in
their
simplicity
with
a
will
joe
often
since
have
i
recalled
the
scene
and
the
saying
when
some
young
lady
complains
to
me
i
have
no
time
to
give
to
doing
good
i
visits
to
make
and
shopping
to
do
and
embroidery
to
finish
how
can
i
help
the
poor
when
i
so
pressed
for
time
i
am
apt
to
say
mentally
how
different
it
would
be
with
her
if
she
had
ever
said
to
herself
a
will
yes
with
a
will
we
can
do
almost
anything
that
ought
to
be
done
and
without
a
will
we
can
do
nothing
as
it
should
be
done
to
all
of
us
whatever
our
station
there
come
difficulties
and
trials
if
we
yield
to
them
we
are
beaten
down
and
conquered
but
if
we
ourselves
conquer
the
temptation
to
do
wrong
calling
the
strength
of
god
to
aid
us
in
our
struggle
with
the
enemy
we
shall
grow
stronger
and
more
valiant
with
every
battle
and
less
liable
to
fall
again
into
temptation
our
wisdom
and
our
duty
are
to
rouse
ourselves
to
speak
to
our
own
hearts
as
the
child
did
in
his
simple
words
with
a
will
joe
illustration
sha
go
to
effects
of
disobedience
the
following
affecting
narrative
was
related
by
a
father
to
his
son
as
a
warning
from
his
own
bitter
experience
of
the
sin
of
resisting
a
mother
love
and
counsel
what
agony
was
on
my
mother
face
when
all
that
she
had
said
and
suffered
failed
to
move
me
she
rose
to
go
home
and
i
followed
at
a
distance
she
spoke
to
me
no
more
until
she
reached
her
own
door
it
is
school
time
now
she
said
go

son
and
once
more
let
me
beseech
you
to
think
upon
what
i
have
said

i
she
looked
astonished
at
my
boldness
but
replied
firmly

one
of

promise
implicit
obedience
to
my
wishes

the
future
i
dare
you
to
do
it
i
said

me
up
stairs

said
my
mother
who
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
she
trembled
violently
and
was
deadly
pale

this
boy
up
stairs

lock
him
in

in

fearful
rage

replied
but
i
quailed
beneath
her
eyes
then
follow

said
she
as
she
grasped
my
arm
firmly
i
raised
my
foot
o
my
son
hear
me
i
raised
my
foot
and
kicked
her
my
sainted
mother
how
my
head
reels
as
the
torrent
of
memory
rushes
over
me
i
kicked
my
mother
a
feeble
woman
my
mother
she
staggered
back
a
few
steps
and
leaned
against
the
wall
she
did
not
look
at
me
o
heavenly
father
she
cried
forgive
him
he
knows
not
what
he
does
the
gardener
just
then
passing
the
door
and
seeing
my
mother
pale
and
almost
unable
to
support
herself
came
in
take
this
boy
up
stairs
and
lock
him
in
his
room
said
she
and
turned
from
me
she
gave
me
a
look
of
agony
mingled
with
most
intense
love
from
a
true
and
tender
heart
that
was
broken
in
a
moment
i
found
myself
a
prisoner
in
my
own
room
i
thought
for
a
moment
i
would
fling
myself
from
the
open
window
but
i
felt
that
i
was
afraid
to
die
i
was
not
penitent
at
times
my
heart
was
subdued
but
my
stubbornness
rose
in
an
instant
and
bade
me
not
yield
yet
illustration
was
my
the
pale
face
of
my
mother
haunted
me
i
flung
myself
on
my
bed
and
fell
asleep
just
at
twilight
i
heard
a
footstep
approach
my
door
it
was
my
sister
what
shall
i
tell
mother
for
you
she
said
nothing
i
replied
o
alfred
for
my
sake
and
for
all
our
sakes
say
that
you
are
sorry
she
longs
to
forgive
you
i
would
not
answer
i
heard
her
footsteps
slowly
retreating
and
flung
myself
on
the
bed
to
pass
a
wretched
night
another
footstep
slower
and
more
feeble
than
my
sister
disturbed
me
alfred
my
son
shall
i
come
in
she
asked
i
can
not
tell
what
influence
made
me
speak
adverse
to
my
feelings
the
gentle
voice
of
my
mother
that
thrilled
me
melted
the
ice
from
my
heart
and
i
longed
to
throw
myself
upon
her
neck
but
i
did
not
my
words
gave
the
lie
to
my
heart
when
i
said
i
was
not
sorry
i
heard
her
withdraw
i
heard
her
groan
i
longed
to
call
her
back
but
i
did
not
i
was
awakened
from
an
uneasy
slumber
by
hearing
my
name
called
loudly
and
my
sister
stood
by
my
bedside
get
up
alfred
do
wait
a
minute
get
up
and
come
with
me
mother
is
dying
i
thought
i
was
yet
dreaming
but
i
got
up
mechanically
and
followed
my
sister
on
the
bed
pale
as
marble
lay
my
mother
she
was
not
yet
undressed
she
had
thrown
herself
upon
the
bed
to
rest
and
rising
again
to
go
to
me
she
was
seized
with
heart
failure
and
borne
to
her
room
i
can
not
tell
you
my
agony
as
i
looked
upon
her
my
remorse
was
tenfold
more
bitter
from
the
thought
that
she
never
would
know
it
i
believed
myself
to
be
her
murderer
i
fell
on
the
bed
beside
her
i
could
not
weep
my
heart
burned
within
me
my
brain
was
on
fire
my
sister
threw
her
arms
around
me
and
wept
in
silence
suddenly
we
saw
a
motion
of
mother
hand
her
eyes
unclosed
she
had
recovered
her
consciousness
but
not
her
speech
mother
mother
i
shrieked
say
only
that
you
forgive
me
she
could
not
speak
but
her
hand
pressed
mine
she
looked
upon
me
and
lifting
her
thin
white
hands
she
clasped
my
own
within
them
and
cast
her
eyes
upward
she
moved
her
lips
in
prayer
and
thus
died
i
remained
kneeling
beside
that
dear
form
till
my
sister
removed
me
but
the
joy
of
youth
had
left
me
forever

tell
us
about
the
little
drummer
boy
whose
motto

by
the
ship
grandmother
is
not
used
to
telling
children
stories
but
if
you
will
be
quiet
she
will
try
and
this
is
the
story
she
told
us
during
one
of
the
fiercest
battles
of
the
civil
war
the
colonel
of
a
michigan
regiment
noticed
a
very
small
boy
acting
as
drummer
the
great
coolness
and
of
the
boy
as
displayed
during
the
engagement
his
habitual
reserve
so
singular
in
one
of
his
years
his
orderly
conduct
and
his
fond
devotion
to
his
drum
his
only
companion
except
a
few
books
all
these
things
unusual
in
one
so
young
had
attracted
notice
both
from
the
officers
and
the
men
colonel
b
curiosity
was
aroused
and
he
desired
to
know
more
of
him
so
he
ordered
that
the
boy
should
be
sent
to
his
tent
the
little
fellow
came
his
drum
on
his
breast
and
the
sticks
in
his
hands
he
paused
before
the
colonel
and
made
his
best
military
salute
he
was
a
noble
looking
boy
the
sunburnt
tint
of
his
face
in
good
keeping
with
his
dark
crisp
curls
illustration
drummer
boy
in
but
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
the
rounded
cheeks
and
dimpled
chin
was
the
look
of
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
in
the
serious
childish
eyes
he
was
a
boy
who
seemed
to
have
been
prematurely
taught
the
of
a
man
a
strange
thrill
went
through
colonel
b
heart
as
the
boy
stood
before
him
come
forward
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
the
boy
stepped
forward
showing
no
surprise
under
the
novel
position
in
which
he
found
himself
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
your
conduct
yesterday
said
the
colonel
from
the
fact
that
you
are
so
young
and
small
for
your
position
thank
you
colonel
i
only
did
my
duty
i
am
big
enough
for
that
if
i
small
replied
the
noble
little
fellow
were
you
not
very
much
frightened
when
the
battle
began
questioned
colonel
b
i
might
have
been
if
i
had
let
myself
think
of
it
but
i
kept
my
mind
on
my
drum
i
went
in
to
play
for
the
men
it
was
that
i
volunteered
for
so
i
said
to
myself
trouble
yourself
about
what
concern
you
jack
but
do
your
duty
and
stand
by
the
ship
why
that
is
sailors
talk
said
the
colonel
it
is
a
very
good
saying
if
it
is
sir
said
jack
i
see
you
understand
the
meaning
of
it
let
that
rule
guide
you
through
life
and
you
will
gain
the
respect
of
all
good
men
father
jack
told
me
that
when
he
taught
me
to
say
by
the
ship
he
was
your
father
no
sir
i
never
had
a
father
but
he
brought
me
up
strange
said
the
colonel
musing
how
much
i
feel
like
befriending
this
child
tell
me
your
story
jack
i
will
tell
it
sir
as
near
as
i
can
as
father
jack
told
it
to
me
my
mother
sailed
on
a
merchant
ship
from
france
to
baltimore
where
my
father
was
living
a
great
storm
arose
the
ship
was
driven
on
rocks
where
she
split
and
all
hands
had
to
take
to
the
boats
they
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
but
at
last
a
ship
bound
for
liverpool
took
them
up
they
had
lost
everything
but
the
clothes
they
had
on
but
the
captain
was
very
kind
to
them
he
gave
them
clothes
and
some
money
my
mother
refused
to
remain
at
liverpool
though
she
was
quite
sick
for
she
wanted
to
get
to
this
country
so
badly
so
she
took
passage
in
another
merchant
ship
just
going
to
new
york
she
was
the
only
woman
on
board
she
grew
worse
after
the
ship
sailed
the
sailors
took
care
of
her
father
jack
was
a
sailor
on
this
ship
and
he
pitied
her
very
much
and
he
did
all
he
could
for
her
but
she
died
and
left
me
an
infant
nobody
knew
what
to
do
with
me
they
all
said
i
would
die
all
but
father
jack
he
asked
the
doctor
to
give
me
to
him
the
doctor
said
him
try
his
hand
if
he
has
a
mind
to
it
no
use
the
little
one
will
be
sure
to
go
overboard
after
it
mother
but
the
doctor
was
wrong
illustration
i
went
errands
for
gentlemen
and
swept
out
offices
and
stores
i
was
brought
safe
to
new
york
he
tried
to
find
my
father
but
did
not
know
how
to
do
it
for
no
one
knew
my
mother
name
at
last
he
left
me
with
a
family
in
new
york
and
he
went
to
sea
again
but
he
never
could
find
out
anything
about
my
mother
although
he
inquired
in
liverpool
and
elsewhere
the
last
time
he
went
to
sea
i
was
nine
years
old
and
he
gave
me
a
present
on
my
birthday
the
day
before
he
sailed
it
was
the
last
he
never
came
back
again
he
died
of
ship
fever
but
father
jack
did
well
by
me
he
had
me
placed
in
a
free
school
at
seven
years
of
age
and
always
paid
my
board
in
advance
for
a
year
so
you
see
sir
i
had
a
fair
start
to
help
myself
which
i
did
right
off
i
went
errands
for
gentlemen
and
swept
out
offices
and
stores
no
one
liked
to
begin
with
me
for
they
all
thought
me
too
small
but
they
soon
saw
i
got
along
well
enough
illustration
i
went
to
school
just
the
same
for
i
did
my
jobs
before
nine
in
the
morning
and
after
school
closed
at
night
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
work
and
learn
my
lessons
i
would
give
up
my
school
for
father
jack
told
me
to
learn
all
i
could
and
some
day
i
would
find
my
father
and
he
must
not
find
me
a
poor
ignorant
boy
he
said
i
must
look
my
father
in
the
face
and
say
to
him
without
falsehood
i
may
be
poor
and
rough
but
i
have
always
been
an
honest
boy
and
stood
by
the
ship
so
you
need
be
ashamed
of
me
sir
i
could
never
forget
those
words
he
dropped
his
cap
drum
and
sticks
bared
his
little
arm
and
showed
the
figure
of
a
ship
in
full
sail
with
this
motto
beneath
it
pricked
into
the
skin
stand
by
the
ship
when
i
was
twelve
i
left
new
york
and
came
to
detroit
with
a
gentleman
in
the
book
business
i
was
there
two
years
when
the
war
broke
out
one
day
a
few
months
afterward
i
was
passing
by
a
recruiting
office
and
went
in
i
heard
them
say
they
wanted
a
drummer
i
offered
they
laughed
and
said
i
was
too
little
but
they
brought
me
a
drum
and
i
beat
it
for
them
they
agreed
to
take
me
so
the
old
stars
and
stripes
was
the
ship
for
me
to
stand
by
the
colonel
was
silent
he
seemed
to
be
in
deep
thought
how
do
you
ever
expect
he
said
to
find
your
father
you
do
not
even
know
his
name
i
do
know
sir
but
i
am
sure
i
shall
find
him
somehow
my
father
will
be
certain
to
know
that
i
am
the
right
boy
when
he
does
find
me
for
i
have
something
to
show
him
that
was
my
mother
and
he
drew
forth
a
little
canvas
bag
sewed
tightly
all
around
and
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
string
in
this
he
said
is
a
pretty
bracelet
that
my
mother
always
wore
on
her
arm
father
jack
took
it
off
after
she
died
to
keep
for
me
he
said
i
must
never
open
it
until
i
found
my
father
and
that
i
must
wear
it
so
around
my
neck
that
it
might
be
safe
a
bracelet
did
you
say
exclaimed
the
colonel
let
me
have
it
i
must
see
it
at
once
with
both
his
small
hands
clasped
around
it
the
little
boy
stood
looking
into
colonel
b
face
then
slipping
the
string
from
over
his
head
he
silently
placed
it
in
his
hand
to
rip
open
the
canvas
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
i
think
i
know
this
bracelet
stammered
colonel
b
if
it
be
as
i
hope
and
believe
within
the
locket
we
will
find
two
names
and
carleton
date
may
illustration
silently
placed
it
in
his
there
were
the
names
as
he
said
colonel
clasped
the
boy
to
his
heart
crying
brokenly
my
son
my
son
i
must
now
go
back
in
my
story
in
the
first
year
of
his
married
life
colonel
and
his
lovely
young
wife
sailed
for
europe
expecting
to
remain
several
years
in
southern
europe
on
account
of
the
delicate
health
of
his
wife
he
was
engaged
in
merchandise
in
the
city
of
baltimore
the
sudden
death
of
his
business
partner
compelled
his
return
to
america
leaving
his
wife
with
her
mother
in
italy
soon
after
he
left
his
died
then
prepared
to
return
to
baltimore
at
once
and
took
passage
on
the
steamer
which
was
lost
vainly
he
made
inquiries
no
tidings
came
of
her
at
last
he
gave
her
up
as
dead
he
almost
lost
his
reason
from
grief
and
doubt
fourteen
years
had
passed
he
did
not
know
that
god
in
his
mercy
had
spared
to
him
a
precious
link
with
the
young
life
so
lost
and
mourned
restless
and
almost
aimless
he
removed
to
michigan
when
the
war
broke
out
he
was
among
the
first
to
join
the
army
there
stood
the
boy
tears
streaming
down
his
cheeks
father
he
said
you
have
found
me
at
last
just
as
father
jack
said
you
are
a
great
gentleman
while
i
am
only
a
poor
drummer
boy
but
i
have
been
an
honest
boy
and
tried
my
best
to
do
what
was
right
you
wo
be
ashamed
of
me
father
i
am
proud
to
call
you
my
son
and
thank
god
for
bringing
you
to
me
just
as
you
are
my
little
hero
is
now
a
grown
man
and
as
the
boy
was
so
is
the
man
stand
by
the
ship
the
motto
which
served
him
so
well
while
a
boy
is
his
motto
still
illustration
a
faithful
shepherd
boy
gerhardt
was
a
german
shepherd
boy
and
a
noble
fellow
he
was
although
he
was
very
poor
one
day
he
was
watching
his
flock
which
was
feeding
in
a
valley
on
the
borders
of
a
forest
when
a
hunter
came
out
of
the
woods
and
asked
how
far
is
it
to
the
nearest
village
six
miles
sir
replied
the
boy
but
the
road
is
only
a
sheep
track
and
very
easily
missed
the
hunter
looked
at
the
crooked
track
and
said
my
lad
i
am
very
hungry
and
thirsty
i
have
lost
my
companions
and
missed
my
way
leave
your
sheep
and
show
me
the
road
i
will
pay
you
well
i
can
not
leave
my
sheep
sir
replied
gerhardt
they
will
stray
into
the
forest
and
may
be
eaten
by
wolves
or
stolen
by
robbers
well
what
of
that
queried
the
hunter
they
are
not
your
sheep
the
loss
of
one
or
more
would
be
much
to
your
master
and
i
give
you
more
than
you
have
earned
in
a
whole
year
i
can
not
go
sir
rejoined
gerhardt
very
firmly
my
master
pays
me
for
my
time
and
he
trusts
me
with
his
sheep
if
i
were
to
sell
my
time
which
does
not
belong
to
me
and
the
sheep
should
get
lost
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
i
stole
them
well
said
the
hunter
will
you
trust
your
sheep
with
me
while
you
go
to
the
village
and
get
some
food
drink
and
a
guide
i
will
take
care
of
them
for
you
the
boy
shook
his
head
the
sheep
do
not
know
your
voice
and
he
stopped
speaking
and
what
ca
you
trust
me
do
i
look
like
a
dishonest
man
asked
the
hunter
angrily
sir
said
the
boy
you
tried
to
make
me
false
to
my
trust
and
wanted
me
to
break
my
word
to
my
master
how
do
i
know
that
you
would
keep
your
word
to
me
the
hunter
laughed
for
he
felt
that
the
lad
had
fairly
cornered
him
he
said
i
see
my
lad
that
you
are
a
good
faithful
boy
i
will
not
forget
you
show
me
the
road
and
i
will
try
to
make
it
out
myself
gerhardt
then
offered
the
contents
of
his
bag
to
the
hungry
man
who
coarse
as
it
was
ate
it
gladly
presently
his
attendants
came
up
and
then
gerhardt
to
his
surprise
found
that
the
hunter
was
the
grand
duke
who
owned
all
the
country
round
the
duke
was
so
pleased
with
the
boy
honesty
that
he
sent
for
him
shortly
after
that
and
had
him
educated
in
after
years
gerhardt
became
a
great
and
powerful
man
but
he
remained
honest
and
true
to
his
dying
day
illustration
his
attendants
came
up
illustration
dick
harris
or
the
dick
harris
was
called
a
clever
boy
and
no
one
believed
this
more
firmly
than
he
he
was
only
fourteen
years
of
age
and
yet
he
dearly
loved
to
be
thought
a
man
as
he
was
about
to
leave
school
his
friends
often
asked
him
what
he
intended
to
be
dick
could
not
tell
only
that
it
must
be
something
great
now
while
dick
had
learned
some
good
thing
in
school
he
had
also
learned
many
evil
habits
among
them
the
practice
of
smoking
dick
father
smoked
he
saw
men
smoking
in
the
streets
and
so
he
thought
it
would
be
manly
to
smoke
along
with
some
of
his
schoolmates
he
used
to
hide
himself
and
take
his
turn
of
the
one
pipe
or
cigar
which
they
had
among
them
as
they
were
afraid
of
being
found
out
they
hid
the
pipe
when
any
one
came
near
his
father
who
although
he
smoked
himself
forbade
dick
doing
so
asked
him
one
day
why
his
clothes
smelled
so
of
tobacco
smoke
some
of
my
schoolmates
smoke
father
but
do
you
smoke
no
take
care
you
do
then
it
all
very
well
for
men
but
i
wo
have
any
of
my
children
smoking
dick
went
away
as
the
bible
says
with
a
lie
in
his
right
hand
and
yet
he
wanted
to
be
a
man
now
look
at
that
my
lads
what
is
it
that
makes
a
man
i
mean
a
true
man
there
are
many
things
the
bible
says
that
the
glory
of
young
men
is
their
strength
strength
of
body
and
strength
of
mind
would
dick
get
this
kind
of
glory
by
smoking
he
certainly
would
not
strengthen
his
body
for
it
has
been
proved
again
and
again
that
boys
who
smoke
weaken
their
bodies
tobacco
is
a
poison
slower
perhaps
than
strong
drink
but
quite
as
sure
and
although
it
may
not
kill
you
outright
because
the
quantity
taken
is
not
large
enough
yet
it
pollutes
the
blood
injures
the
brain
and
stomach
and
paralyzes
many
of
the
healthy
functions
of
the
body
the
result
is
stunted
growth
and
general
weakness
a
boy
who
smokes
much
never
can
have
the
glory
of
bodily
strength
dick
found
this
out
for
himself
to
his
bitter
regret
and
besides
this
do
you
think
that
his
conduct
showed
strength
of
mind
he
began
the
practice
of
smoking
not
because
he
believed
it
to
be
right
but
because
smoked
he
was
only
a
boy
yet
he
wished
to
appear
that
is
to
appear
what
he
was
what
could
be
more
weak
than
for
a
boy
to
have
no
reason
for
doing
a
thing
than
that
do
it
but
it
led
to
something
worse
he
was
smoking
on
the
sly
and
to
conceal
it
he
became
a
liar
he
lied
in
the
school
by
his
conduct
he
lied
at
home
by
his
words
we
could
have
respected
him
although
we
pitied
him
had
he
smoked
openly
and
taken
the
consequences
but
who
can
respect
a
coward
he
is
not
worthy
of
the
name
of
dick
continued
to
smoke
after
he
left
school
and
was
apprenticed
in
a
large
warehouse
illustration
the
associate
of
fast
young
men
and
learned
to
here
again
the
old
desire
to
be
like
men
influenced
him
they
had
cigars
he
must
have
one
they
smoked
he
must
do
so
this
conduct
had
its
invariable
effects
he
became
the
associate
of
fast
young
men
got
into
debt
learned
to
drink
stayed
out
late
at
night
and
before
his
apprenticeship
had
ended
was
ruined
in
health
and
but
for
the
indulgence
of
his
employers
would
have
been
discharged
in
disgrace
was
that
acting
the
part
of
a
man
this
happened
many
years
ago
last
week
amidst
a
crowd
who
surrounded
a
polling
booth
there
stood
a
man
about
forty
years
of
age
he
looked
twenty
years
older
on
his
head
was
a
battered
hat
he
wore
a
seedy
black
coat
both
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
and
in
his
mouth
the
stump
of
a
cigar
which
had
been
by
another
man
his
face
was
bloated
his
eyes
bleared
and
languid
even
the
vulgar
crowd
looked
at
him
with
contempt
i
looked
into
his
face
thinking
there
was
in
it
a
resemblance
to
one
i
had
known
slowly
and
painfully
came
the
sad
truth
that
the
drunken
creature
was
dick
harris
he
had
become
a
man
but
he
was
a
lost
man
it
has
often
been
said
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
kindleth
the
spark
which
kindled
a
blaze
among
dick
evil
passions
was
the
spark
which
lit
the
tobacco
pipe
at
school
bad
habits
are
easily
acquired
but
they
are
hard
to
get
rid
of
see
what
smoking
had
done
for
dick
it
led
him
to
drink
and
the
two
habits
have
left
him
a
wreck
but
you
say
to
me
there
are
many
thousands
who
smoke
and
yet
are
strong
men
it
is
so
but
in
almost
all
cases
these
strong
smokers
did
not
begin
the
habit
while
they
were
boys
if
they
had
done
so
the
likelihood
is
they
never
would
have
become
strong
men
besides
how
much
stronger
they
might
have
been
if
they
had
never
smoked
illustration
drunken
creature
was
dick
many
who
smoke
and
still
appear
strong
have
nevertheless
undermined
their
constitution
and
when
an
unusual
strain
comes
upon
it
there
is
a
collapse
but
again
you
say
all
who
smoke
do
not
learn
to
drink
and
so
lose
true
manhood
that
may
be
and
yet
there
is
a
significant
fact
that
a
confirmed
drunkard
who
does
not
smoke
can
scarcely
be
found
it
has
recently
been
shown
that
the
great
majority
of
those
who
break
their
temperance
pledge
are
smokers
smoking
and
drinking
are
branches
of
the
same
deadly
tree
whose
leaves
curse
the
nation
and
now
my
lads
quit
you
like
men
be
strong
the
next
time
any
one
says
to
you
have
a
cigar
say
no
if
he
says
it
is
manly
to
smoke
say
no
it
is
manly
to
exercise
to
act
from
principle
to
have
cleanly
habits
to
be
unselfish
to
pay
one
debts
to
be
sober
and
to
have
the
approval
of
one
conscience
now
i
might
lose
all
these
elements
of
manhood
if
i
learned
to
smoke

dear
grandma
is
one
of
those
who
being
dead
yet
speaketh
she
was
not
a
preacher
or
a
lecturer
much
less
a
censurer
or
reprover
but
she
was
that
most
agreeable
of
teachers
to
childhood
and
youth
a
yet
let
no
one
suppose
that
she
told
us
tales
of
fairy
lore
or
ingenious
romance
as
pernicious
as
they
are
false
not
so
the
stories
to
which
we
listened
with
so
much
delight
were
all
true
and
all
from
the
capacious
of
her
own
memory
we
had
returned
from
the
church
one
sabbath
afternoon
and
as
usual
hastened
to
grandma
to
repeat
as
much
as
we
could
remember
of
the
sermon
the
text
was
that
solemn
command
of
the
wise
man
my
son
if
sinners
entice
thee
consent
thou
not
and
our
pastor
had
made
it
the
of
a
powerful
exhortation
to
the
young
especially
to
beware
of
the
many
temptations
snares
and
allurements
which
they
should
meet
and
warned
them
of
the
consequences
of
yielding
to
the
seductive
influences
by
which
they
might
be
surrounded
that
reminds
me
of
a
young
man
whom
i
knew
before
any
of
you
were
born
grandma
remarked
when
we
had
reported
as
much
as
we
could
remember
of
the
sermon
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
jacob
wise
she
said
addressing
my
father
yes
mother
he
replied
please
tell
the
children
about
him
i
am
sure
your
account
of
his
experience
will
be
a
very
suitable
addition
to
our
afternoon
sermon
o
yes
grandma
please
do
we
exclaimed
and
drawing
our
seats
around
her
we
prepared
for
what
we
knew
would
be
a
treat
the
good
old
lady
did
not
need
to
be
urged
but
after
pausing
a
moment
to
collect
her
thoughts
began
as
follows
jacob
wise
was
the
son
of
a
near
neighbor
when
i
was
a
happy
wife
in
my
western
home
his
father
was
a
plain
practical
man
respected
for
his
uprightness
good
sense
and
piety
and
he
brought
up
his
son
in
his
own
sound
principles
at
the
same
time
giving
him
all
the
education
that
was
within
his
reach
when
jacob
was
about
fourteen
years
of
age
he
was
sent
to
louisville
for
the
benefit
of
a
year
instruction
in
a
large
school
there
there
were
also
other
sons
and
daughters
around
his
father
hearth
it
therefore
appeared
expedient
that
jacob
should
be
allowed
to
develop
his
taste
for
commercial
pursuits
the
first
circumstances
of
any
note
that
i
remember
which
particularly
marked
his
character
occurred
at
the
time
of
his
first
practical
acquaintance
with
business
while
in
louisville
he
received
much
attention
from
the
family
of
a
wealthy
man
who
kept
a
large
store
in
the
city
and
when
at
the
close
of
his
school
term
he
was
offered
a
place
behind
the
counter
of
his
friend
he
found
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
his
father
permission
to
accept
of
it
the
merchant
rankin
was
a
smooth
bland
man
and
in
his
intercourse
with
the
world
maintained
outwardly
a
fair
and
honest
character
but
jacob
had
not
been
many
weeks
in
intimate
connection
with
him
before
he
discovered
that
his
dealings
were
not
all
conducted
with
scrupulous
adherence
to
divine
law
neither
was
a
conscientious
regard
to
his
neighbor
interests
a
very
principle
this
caused
the
lad
much
uneasiness
and
a
feeling
of
nervous
disquiet
took
possession
of
the
hitherto
happy
boy
he
hesitated
as
to
which
was
the
more
honorable
course
to
obey
his
employer
without
question
or
to
sacrifice
his
own
ideas
of
strict
integrity
but
he
was
not
long
left
in
doubt
one
day
a
carriage
drove
to
the
door
and
a
richly
dressed
lady
entered
the
store
and
asked
to
be
shown
some
children
necklaces
jacob
who
attended
in
that
department
was
proceeding
to
wait
on
her
when
rankin
came
forward
smiling
and
with
the
ease
and
courtesy
for
which
he
was
noted
took
the
lad
place
and
spread
before
the
lady
an
assortment
of
glittering
trinkets
which
judging
from
her
gay
appearance
he
knew
would
please
her
eye
illustration
all
this
jacob
listened
with
grief
and
an
animated
dialogue
ensued
between
the
merchant
and
his
customer
respecting
the
style
and
value
of
the
various
articles
under
view
the
lady
was
made
to
believe
that
this
elegant
display
had
been
imported
with
great
cost
and
difficulty
from
the
manufacturing
cities
of
europe
and
in
consequence
of
the
immense
and
rapid
demand
for
them
the
obliging
trader
had
been
satisfied
with
moderate
profit
and
was
now
willing
to
dispose
of
the
remainder
of
the
stock
at
fabulously
low
prices
illustration
it
quite
impossible
that
they
could
to
all
this
which
he
knew
to
be
utterly
and
shamelessly
false
jacob
listened
with
equal
grief
and
astonishment
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
restrained
his
honest
indignation
as
he
saw
one
after
another
of
the
tinsel
gewgaws
transferred
to
the
shopping
bag
of
the
deceived
customer
at
prices
which
were
five
times
their
value
while
she
was
duped
with
the
flattering
persuasion
that
she
was
receiving
unequaled
bargains
all
doubts
as
to
the
unlawfulness
of
his
remaining
another
hour
under
the
roof
where
this
swindling
transaction
had
taken
place
were
immediately
removed
from
the
mind
of
the
noble
and
upright
youth
when
rankin
returned
after
having
very
politely
attended
the
lady
to
her
carriage
and
placed
the
parcel
containing
her
purchases
by
her
side
he
was
met
by
jacob
who
with
an
air
of
grave
rebuke
rarely
assumed
by
lads
of
his
years
informed
him
that
from
what
he
had
seen
of
his
method
of
conducting
business
he
thought
it
quite
impossible
that
they
could
agree
he
was
therefore
resolved
to
return
without
delay
to
his
house
and
he
was
glad
that
the
terms
upon
which
he
had
entered
the
establishment
left
him
free
to
do
so
the
firm
and
fearless
bearing
of
the
boy
awed
the
man
of
unjust
practices
and
he
neither
attempted
to
vindicate
his
own
meanness
nor
to
oppose
the
departure
of
his
assistant
at
once
jacob
returned
to
the
old
homestead
his
character
more
permanently
formed
by
the
ordeal
through
which
he
had
passed
but
do
you
think
grandma
inquired
henry
that
jacob
would
have
acted
so
independently
if
he
had
had
no
home
to
return
to
yes
dear
i
think
he
would
was
the
prompt
reply
he
had
learned
to
obey
the
commands
of
god
and
to
believe
his
promises
he
knew
that
the
injunction
out
from
among
them
was
followed
by
the
assurance
will
receive
you
and
such
was
his
trust
in
his
heavenly
word
that
no
thought
for
his
future
provision
would
have
interfered
with
the
performance
of
what
he
deemed
to
be
his
duty
well
grandma
said
henry
i
like
the
stand
taken
by
the
honest
boy
please
go
on
with
the
story
jacob
remained
at
home
for
the
next
three
years
making
himself
useful
in
teaching
his
younger
brothers
and
sisters
besides
assisting
his
father
in
the
management
of
his
affairs
in
the
meantime
his
own
education
was
advancing
nor
was
he
without
receiving
many
offers
of
clerkship
in
the
neighboring
cities
whither
the
good
report
of
his
honesty
and
integrity
had
come
but
a
cousin
of
his
father
who
was
a
merchant
of
some
eminence
in
new
orleans
had
proposed
to
take
him
into
his
counting
house
in
a
confidential
capacity
when
he
should
reach
a
more
mature
age
and
for
this
important
post
he
was
qualifying
himself
accordingly
when
he
was
eighteen
years
of
age
at
the
request
of
his
relative
he
again
left
home
this
time
his
departure
was
a
more
serious
affair
than
it
had
been
when
a
few
years
before
he
left
for
school
in
louisville
now
he
was
going
to
a
large
and
populous
city
where
fashion
and
vice
walked
hand
in
hand
and
where
snares
and
pitfalls
were
spread
for
the
simple
and
unwary
with
scarcely
a
cautioning
them
to
beware
all
the
neighborhood
was
moved
with
anxiety
and
friendly
interest
for
the
youth
and
the
last
sabbath
of
his
attendance
at
our
rural
church
the
good
pastor
made
an
earnest
and
affectionate
address
from
the
same
text
which
the
minister
presented
our
friend

to
the
great
maritime
city

his
son
to
louisville

the
necessary
preliminary
arrangements
went
with
him
on

the
boat
that
was
to
bear
him
down
the
broad
waters
of
the
mississippi
the
parting
advice
and
benediction
of
his
father
were
then
given
he
reminded
him
of
the
subject
of
his
pastor
last
sermon
and
closed
by
giving
him
as
the
motto
of
his
life
the
imperative
charge
out
from
among
them
then
as
he
desired
to
return
home
by
daylight
and
the
boat
was
not
to
start
for
a
couple
of
hours
he
once
more
committed
his
son
to
the
care
and
guidance
of
heaven
and
left
him
with
a
calm
trust
that
he
would
be
kept
in
the
way
of
safety

a
pleasant
trip
on
board

young
friend

in

jacob
was
much
pleased
with
his
new
situation

found
his
relative
a
man
of
the
most
honorable
character
accommodations
were
procured
for
him
in
a
where
none
but
persons
of
the
best
standing
were
admitted
and
whether
owing
to
his
attractions
of
mind
or
person
the
sterling
worth
of
his
character
or
the
independent
position
of
his
family
or
perhaps
all
these
combined
he
soon
found
himself
an
object
of
marked
interest
and
attention
to
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact

down

naturally

most
favorable
light
jacob
saw
none
of
those
vicious
traits
and
habits
which
he
had
been
cautioned
to
shun
he
did
not
partake
of
the
mirthful
spirit
by
which
the
unwary
are
enticed
into
scenes
of
folly
neither
did
he
deny
himself
innocent
recreations
and
now
to
the
unsophisticated
youth
life
presented
the
fairest
aspect
his
religious
duties
were
carefully
attended
to

in
the
faithful
discharge
of
his
business

no
one
could
be
more
careful
and
punctual
his
evenings
were
devoted
to
the
society
of
those
who
were
congenial
to
him
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
hidden
thorns
of
the
flowers
that
strewed
his
path
began
to
make
themselves
felt
nor
was
it
without
pain
that
conscience
awoke
him
from
the
repose
in
which
he
had
been
lulling
himself

sojourners

temperament

now
in

was

equaled
by
the
sweetness
of
her
disposition

had
been
brought
up
without
much
restriction
or
control
and
now
that
she
was
entering
society
for
the
first
time
being
gay

and
witty
she
flung
herself
into
the
enjoyments

zest

nature

young
christian
was
never

to
join
the
giddy
multitude
in
their
unlawful
pastimes
yet
his
views
were
more
lax

had
been

hope
of
his
presence
having
a
restraining
effect
upon
the
fair
being
who
had
touched
the
tenderest

into
scenes
such
as
sober
conscience
could
not
approve
at
length
however
the
alarm
came
that
was
to
disturb
his
security
a
sermon
was
to
be
preached
by
a
celebrated
minister
before
the
members
of
the
men
christian
association
jacob
attended
and
heard
with
startled
interest
the
minister
deliver
as
his
text
the
very
same
verse
which
the
pious
pastor
of
his
country
home
had
made
the
subject
of
the
last
discourse
he
had
heard
from
him
son
when
sinners
entice
thee
consent
thou
not
the
young
man
of
irreproachable
life
had
no
idea
that
this
exhortation
could
be
applied
to
his
case
he
had
been
careful
that
were
granted
no
opportunity
of
enticing
him
but
to
many
of
the
young
men
present
who
were
not
so
cautious
he
hoped
the
sermon
would
prove
of
benefit
so
he
settled
himself
comfortably
to
listen
to
the
brilliant
orator
but
his
did
not
last
long
it
was
that
very
class
to
which
he
belonged
that
the
preacher
addressed
he
exposed
the
cunning
temptations
of
satan
and
told
how
he
labored
to
lead
even
those
who
hated
vice
to
join
in
the
pleasures
of
the
world
without
requiring
them
to
commit
one
apparent
sin
thus
the
enemy
sought
to
lead
even
the
christian
and
to
turn
his
heart
from
god
from
holiness
and
from
heaven
painfully
solemn
were
the
feelings
with
which
jacob
left
the
house
of
god
at
the
close
of
the
service
the
film
had
passed
from
his
eyes
and
he
saw
that
while
his
outward
walk
had
been
strictly
correct
his
heart
had
wandered
from
its
true
allegiance
when
he
reached
home
he
found
a
gay
party
of
young
people
dancing
and
making
merry
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
parlors
but
the
sickening
sensations
that
ran
through
his
frame
at
the
thought
of
time
thus
wasted
and
creatures
fashioned
in
their
maker
image
perverting
their
fine
intelligences
showed
the
change
that
had
been
made
in
his
views
within
the
last
hour
he
went
at
once
to
his
chamber
and
with
earnest
prayer
he
gave
himself
anew
to
his
master
he
decided
at
once
that
isabel
must
be
given
up
with
all
her
attractions
how
lone
and
cheerless
the
future
appeared
casting
himself
upon
his
knees
he
prayed
for
help
to
bear
the
blow
which
had
descended
upon
his
hopes
with
jacob
wise
to
know
his
duty
was
to
do
it
having
felt
the
evil
influence
of
intimate
association
with
light
and
giddy
worldlings
he
determined
to
change
his
boarding
place
to
some
more
retired
spot
where
no
similar
temptation
should
waylay
him
and
so
the
next
morning
he
called
on
his
pastor
stated
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
and
asked
his
help
in
obtaining
board
in
some
private
family
connected
with
the
church
illustration
next
morning
he
called
on
his
the
minister
sympathized
with
his
young
friend
and
after
a
few
minutes
thought
mentioned
a
pious
couple
of
his
charge
whose
only
son
had
lately
gone
from
home
and
into
whose
vacant
room
he
thought
it
likely
jacob
might
be
admitted
it
was
as
he
had
hoped
when
bennet
heard
the
case
she
was
glad
to
be
able
to
give
a
home
to
the
young
man
no
other
difficulty
now
remained
but
his
parting
with
isabel
he
found
her
seated
at
the
piano
and
a
long
conversation
ensued
in
which
opinions
and
sentiments
entirely
opposite
were
maintained
by
each
on
subjects
of
vital
importance
they
were
disagreed
so
that
finally
they
whose
hearts
had
received
their
first
tender
impressions
from
each
other
with
an
apparent
calmness
inconsistent
with
their
true
feelings
separated
to
meet
no
more
grandma
paused
and
for
several
minutes
no
one
seemed
disposed
to
speak
each
of
us
was
looking
into
his
own
heart
to
see
if
there
were
grace
enough
there
to
bear
us
conquerors
through
such
trials
as
might
be
in
store
for
us
the
silence
was
broken
by
henry
inquiring
the
sequel
of
the
young
christian
career
well
said
grandma
jacob
continued
to
live
a
consistent
christian
life
he
visited
his
parents
every
summer
gladdening
their
hearts
by
the
purity
and
simplicity
of
his
life
when
he
had
been
six
or
seven
years
in
new
orleans
he
was
taken
into
partnership
by
his
kinsman
and
employer
and
shortly
after
he
married
the
daughter
of
his
pastor
whose
sweet
companionship
was
a
great
help
to
him
in
his
christian
life
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
hearing
of
jacob
wise
but
i
dare
say
if
still
living
he
is
an
example
of
moral
dignity
truth
and
uprightness
and
an
honor
to
the
church
of
which
he
has
been
from
childhood
a
steady
and
consistent
member

lesson
hurrah
hurrah
such
a
splendid
morning
for
skating
clear
as
jelly
and
as
cold
as
ice
cream
come
ahead
boys
there
no
telling
how
long
this
weather
will
last
so
said
roger
to
his
two
friends
whom
he
met
on
his
way
to
the
park
his
eyes
sparkled
his
cheeks
were
almost
as
bright
as
the
scarlet
muffler
he
wore
around
his
neck
and
the
dangling
skates
told
for
themselves
the
expedition
upon
which
he
was
bound
the
other
boys
readily
agreed
to
join
him
and
after
running
home
for
their
skates
the
party
started
off
in
such
high
spirits
that
the
conductor
of
the
car
which
they
entered
begged
them
to
be
a
little
more
quiet
not
quite
so
noisy
please
young
gentlemen
he
said
as
they
paid
their
fare
pshaw
said
roger
while
bob
made
a
face
when
his
back
was
turned
to
them
giving
frank
an
opportunity
of
noticing
the
large
patch
on
his
overcoat
he
made
some
funny
speech
about
it
at
which
the
others
laughed
heartily
it
usually
does
boys
good
to
laugh
unless
the
laugh
be
at
the
expense
of
some
one
else
a
laugh
is
good
for
the
heart
after
a
while
the
car
stopped
for
another
passenger
the
conductor
assisted
the
person
in
getting
on
and
roger
thinking
more
time
was
taken
than
usual
called
out
hurry
up
hurry
up
no
time
to
lose
the
was
a
boy
about
his
own
age
but
sadly
deformed
he
was
a
hunchback
and
had
a
pale
delicate
face
which
spoke
of
sorrow
and
painful
suffering
now
do
move
up
said
the
conductor
as
the
boys
sat
still
not
offering
to
make
room
but
when
he
spoke
they
all
crowded
together
giving
much
more
room
than
was
necessary
the
three
together
trying
to
occupy
the
space
that
one
would
comfortably
fill
they
continued
talking
and
joking
noisily
until
the
car
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
park
bob
and
frank
pushed
out
ahead
of
all
the
other
passengers
roger
was
pushing
out
after
them
when
the
conductor
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
do
crowd
do
crowd
plenty
of
time
young
man
this
expostulation
came
too
late
for
roger
in
his
impatience
to
get
out
unheeding
of
what
he
was
doing
caught
one
of
his
skates
in
the
scarf
of
the
crippled
boy
who
had
been
sitting
next
to
him
he
gave
his
skate
strap
a
rude
pull
knocking
the
boy
rather
roughly
and
stepping
on
a
lady
toes
illustration
was
my
fault
was
bother
take
it
he
exclaimed
impatiently
and
giving
the
scarf
another
jerk
ruder
than
before
he
succeeded
in
disentangling
it
then
he
rushed
out
hurried
over
to
the
boys
who
awaited
him
on
the
pavement
where
they
stood
stamping
their
feet
and
whistling
roger
made
no
reply
to
the
crippled
boy
who
said
to
him
gently
it
was
my
fault
was
it
that
hunchback
caught
his
scarf
in
my
skate
i
thought
it
never
would
come
out
he
exclaimed
it
kept
me
all
this
time
hush
roger
interrupted
frank
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
the
boy
was
just
behind
them
he
had
evidently
heard
what
had
been
said
for
his
pale
face
turned
scarlet
and
lingering
behind
to
see
which
path
the
boys
intended
taking
he
walked
off
in
the
opposite
direction
and
they
soon
lost
sight
of
him
roger
was
hasty
and
impulsive
but
his
nature
was
kindly
after
all
and
when
his
skates
were
fairly
on
the
ice
tried
and
the
first
excitement
of
the
pleasure
over
he
thought
of
his
unfeeling
speech
and
the
pale
sad
face
of
the
boy
rose
before
him
was
it
my
fault
the
question
rang
in
his
ears
was
it
the
boy
fault
that
his
legs
were
crooked
and
his
back
misshapen
and
awkward
was
it
his
fault
that
he
must
go
through
life
receiving
pity
or
contempt
from
his
more
fortunate
whose
limbs
were
better
formed
than
his
own
the
more
roger
thought
the
ruder
his
treatment
of
the
poor
lad
now
seemed
and
putting
himself
in
the
boy
place
he
felt
that
such
words
would
have
cut
him
to
the
quick
i
say
said
bob
who
had
been
cutting
his
initials
on
a
smooth
glassy
spot
of
ice
i
say
roger
what
makes
you
so
glum
why
i
declare
there
the
little
hunchback
sitting
over
there
on
the
bank
looking
at
the
skaters
roger
looked
in
that
direction
and
saw
him
sitting
alone
his
only
enjoyment
consisting
in
seeing
without
at
all
engaging
in
the
pleasure
of
others
what
can
a
poor
fellow
like
that
do
with
himself
i
wonder
added
bob
i
do
suppose
he
can
skate
or
do
anything
else
without
making
a
show
of
himself
that
so
said
roger
thoughtfully
wondering
how
he
could
make
up
for
his
rudeness
or
take
back
his
own
words
he
concluded
to
let
it
all
pass
for
this
time
in
future
he
would
be
more
careful
and
less
hasty
in
speaking
for
roger
did
not
have
sufficient
manliness
to
go
over
to
where
the
boy
was
sitting
and
say
frankly
i
beg
your
pardon
for
my
rudeness
the
boys
proposed
a
game
of
tag
roger
was
a
splendid
skater
he
engaged
in
the
game
with
great
zest
his
spirits
rose
and
the
crippled
boy
and
the
reproaches
of
his
conscience
passed
entirely
out
of
his
mind
as
he
skated
on
knowing
that
he
could
keep
his
balance
as
well
and
strike
out
perhaps
better
than
any
fellow
on
the
pond
the
swiftest
and
strongest
however
are
not
always
the
most
successful
and
as
he
swooped
around
curving
in
very
near
the
shore
a
strap
gave
way
and
before
roger
could
help
himself
it
tripped
him
and
he
sprawled
at
full
length
on
the
ice
the
boys
shouted
some
laughed
but
a
fall
is
such
a
common
occurrence
that
no
one
was
very
much
concerned
until
roger
attempted
to
spring
up
again
to
show
them
all
that
he
did
mind
it
in
the
least
he
would
be
all
right
again
in
a
minute
then
he
tried
to
stand
but
when
an
awful
pain
shot
up
from
his
ankle
then
he
realized
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
stand
they
ran
to
his
assistance
but
before
they
reached
him
a
soft
hand
was
held
out
to
him
and
a
gentle
voice
asked
have
you
hurt
yourself
badly
roger
saw
the
deformed
boy
standing
by
his
side
and
then
remembered
that
he
had
seen
him
sitting
near
by
on
the
bank
illustration
deformed
boy
knelt
on
the
i
think
i
must
have
sprained
my
ankle
he
replied
the
deformed
boy
knelt
on
the
ice
and
while
the
others
clustered
around
asking
questions
and
offering
suggestions
he
quietly
unbuckled
his
skates
for
him
i
have
to
get
home
i
suppose
said
roger
faintly
but
boys
do
let
this
spoil
your
fun
do
come
with
me
may
i
go
with
you
said
the
deformed
boy
i
am
not
going
to
stay
here
any
longer
roger
thanked
him
and
a
policeman
coming
up
at
that
moment
to
inquire
about
the
accident
a
carriage
was
procured
roger
was
put
in
the
deformed
boy
followed
and
roger
was
driven
home
my
fun
is
spoiled
for
this
winter
he
said
with
a
moan
i
know
a
fellow
who
sprained
his
ankle
last
year
and
the
doctor
says
perhaps
he
will
never
be
able
to
skate
again
what
an
unlucky
thing
for
me
it
was
my
fault
either
no
added
the
deformed
boy
gently
it
was
not
your
fault
and
it
was
not
my
fault
that
my
nurse
let
me
fall
when
i
was
a
baby
and
injured
my
back
i
sometimes
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
had
killed
me
outright
though
strong
and
people
think
it
wicked
for
me
to
wish
that
the
color
which
had
left
roger
pale
cheeks
from
his
pain
rushed
back
for
a
moment
as
he
held
out
his
hand
and
said
i
was
a
brute
to
you
in
the
car
this
morning
but
i
did
think
what
i
was
doing
will
you
excuse
me
i
know
you
did
please
do
say
anything
more
about
it
it
is
hard
to
pity
the
suffering
of
others
unless
we
have
felt
pain
ourselves
roger
sprain
prevented
him
from
skating
again
that
season
and
taught
him
also
a
lesson
which
let
us
hope
he
will
remember
all
his
lifetime

bert
was
determined
to
go
he
would
ask
his
father
for
he
was
very
sure
his
father
would
say
no
he
did
quite
like
to
disobey
a
positive
command
so
he
would
say
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
bert
was
thirteen
years
old
and
it
was
high
time
that
he
began
to
exercise
his
own
judgment
at
least
when
his
own
affairs
were
concerned
so
bert
thought
he
would
like
to
know
what
harm
his
going
down
to
the
river
for
a
quiet
moonlight
swim
could
possibly
do
to
anybody
he
would
try
it

would
be

they
did
seem
to
care
whether
their
parents
liked
it
or
not
bert
could
feel
so
exactly
but
still
where
was
the
sense
in
a
boy
going
to
his
father
every
time
he
turned
round
he
was
going
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
that
he
went
up
to
bed
at
the
usual
time
however
but
his
mother
coming
into
his
little
bedroom
about
half
an
hour
afterward
was
surprised
to
find
him
almost
hidden
by
blanket
and
quilt
though
it
was
a
warm
night
in
august
why
bert
you
smother
do
let
me
pull
off

held
them
tightly

you
sick
no

his
mother
as
she
turned
away
i
do
know
what
you
made
of
bert
and
jacket
and
pants
and
stockings
and
shoes
thought
bert
as
he
snapped
his
fingers
very
softly
under
the
weight
of
bedclothes
the
beautiful
moon
looked
in
at
the
little
window
there
had
been
times
when
bert
gazing
at
her
pure
pale
face
had
marveled
that
any
boy
could
have
the
heart
to
do
wrong
when
her
soft
light
was
shining
on
him
but
she
seemed
to
say

no

seemed
as
if
the
hours
had
never
lagged
so
heavily
eleven
was
the
time
agreed
upon
twice
bert
found
himself
napping
suppose
he
should
go
to
sleep
the
idea
was
not
to
be
entertained
for
a
moment
he
sat
up
in
the
bed
and
listened

listened
until
at
length
the
welcome
strokes
greeted
his
ear
he
was
tired
and
sleepy
and
stupid
and
very
warm

opened
his
door
softly
and
went
down

he
did
not
dare
unlock
the
front
door

just
across

crept
through

himself
in

ever
anything
more
fortunate
the
outer

opened
the

softly
and
went

took
his

from

just
then
a

greeted
his
ear

he
in

was
very
glad
to

him
and
was
determined
to
tell
him
so
mew
called
billy
the
from
his
cage
above
dear
me
thought
bert
they
wake
father
up
as
sure
as
the
world
but
it
was
not
unusual
for
billy
to
sing
in
the
night
indeed
his
midnight
music
was
sometimes
overpowering
bert
stood
very
still
for
a
moment
but
could
hear
no
one
stirring
he
walked
on
a
few
steps
cuff
purring
loudly
and
rubbing
her
soft
gray
sides
against
him
illustration
bow
wow
wow
wow
barked
the
faithful
be
quiet
prince
stop
your
noise
prince
knew
his
young
master
voice
and
like
cuff
was
delighted
to
be
near
him
and
so
gave
expression
to
his
feelings
in
a
succession
of
loud
quick
barks
illustration
called
had
you
better
go
down
john
asked
bert
mother
anxiously
afraid
some
one
is
trying
to
get
in
they
ca
get
farther
than
the
shed
was
the
careless
reply
i
left
that
open
in
a
few
moments
all
was
quiet
again
prince
lay
down
at
bert
feet
and
cuff
stretched
herself
out
beside
him
time
was
passing
the
boys
would
surely
be
there
before
him
very
carefully
he
crept
toward
the
door
hardly
daring
to
breathe
in
his
anxiety
illustration
wow
but
prince
had
not
been
asleep
no
indeed
restarted
up
at
the
first
sound
of
his
master
footsteps
it
was
very
evident
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
and
he
was
determined
to
be
in
it
i
must
run
as
fast
as
i
can
said
bert
to
himself
hit
or
miss
there
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
he
was
preparing
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
when
snow
the
old
family
horse
who
for
a
few
days
past
had
been
allowed
to
wander
about
among
the
clover
fields
put
her
white
nose
just
inside
the
door
and
gave
a
loud
and
fiercely
prolonged
neigh
what
next
muttered
bert
between
his
teeth
i
shall
expect
to
see
some
of
the
cows
soon
i
do
care
if
all
the
animals
on
the
place
come
i
going
he
was
walking
defiantly
from
the
door
when
he
heard
his
mother
voice
at
her
window
i
never
can
sleep
john
with
a
horse
crying
around
i
wish
you
go
down
to
see
what
the
trouble
is
and
do
lock
the
shed
door
i
have
slept
five
minutes
illustration
old
family
what
was
bert
to
do
now
to
go
forward
in
the
moonlight
with
his
mother
watching
from
above
would
be
foolish
indeed
to
remain
in
the
shed
to
be
discovered
by
his
father
seemed
equally
unwise
illustration
came
into
the
shed
and
watched
his
father
as
he
mended
an
old
he
had
very
little
time
to
think
about
the
matter
for
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
footsteps
on
the
stairs
he
darted
over
to
the
shed
closet
shut
the
door
and
tremblingly
awaited
the
result
and
the
result
was
that
after
standing
painfully
still
for
about
ten
minutes
during
which
prince
significant
sniffs
and
growls
had
thrice
driven
him
to
the
very
verge
of
disclosure
he
was
left
unmolested
in
the
dark
old
closet
he
opened
the
door
but
the
shed
seemed
darker
yet
no
loving
cat
or
friendly
dog
was
there
to
cheer
or
to
betray
nothing
but
thick
black
darkness
was
it
possible
that
the
moon
was
still
shining
outside
he
wondered
if
the
boys
were
having
a
good
time
he
would
open
the
door
and
go
to
them
as
soon
as
he
dared
but
while
he
was
thinking
and
wondering
waiting
until
he
was
sure
his
father
and
mother
were
asleep
again
the
old
clock
rang
out
the
hour
of
twelve
midnight
it
was
of
no
use
to
go
then
the
boys
would
be
gone
and
so
bert
crept
up
stairs
to
his
room
cross
and
dissatisfied
feeling
that
the
fates
were
against
him
he
was
late
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
his
mother
laughingly
inquired
if
the
weight
of
his
bedclothes
had
affected
his
hearing
yes
no
i
mean
i
guess
not
he
replied
absently
it
was
a
rainy
morning
and
the
weather
was
disagreeably
warm
after
breakfast
bert
came
into
the
shed
and
watched
his
father
as
he
mended
an
old
harness
what
sort
of
boy
is
that
ned
sellars
inquired
his
father
at
length
bert
started
i
do
know
i
think
he
a
pretty
good
boy
why
i
passed
the
house
this
morning
some
one
was
getting
a
terrible
flogging
and
i
think
it
must
have
been
ned
what
for
do
you
know
yes
they
spoke
very
loud
and
i
could
help
hearing
it
was
for
running
off
last
night
going
swimming
i
believe
illustration
one
was
getting
a
terrible
bert
eyes
flashed
that
just
like
his
father
said
he
indignantly
he
never
wants
ned
to
have
any
fun
there
was
no
reply
some
hidden
feeling
he
could
hardly
tell
what
prompted
bert
next
question
would
you
flog
me
father
if
i
went
swimming
without
leave
that
depends
upon
circumstances
replied
his
father
looking
searchingly
into
his
face
if
my
boy
was
mean
enough
to
skulk
out
of
the
house
at
night
when
i
supposed
him
to
be
abed
and
asleep
it
is
just
possible
that
i
might
not
consider
him
worth
flogging
how
bert
cheeks
burned
he
had
never
looked
at
the
matter
in
just
that
light
before
be
a
sneak
my
son
it
is
cowardly
and
disgraceful
bert
made
no
answer
but
his
thoughts
were
busy
was
he
not
every
whit
as
mean
and
cowardly
as
if
he
had
really
gone
with
his
unfortunate
friend
yes
verily
and
then
he
thought
of
his
father
how
he
was
never
denying
him
any
reasonable
pleasure
nay
often
denying
himself
for
his
sake
bert
seemed
to
realize
his
father
goodness
now
as
never
before
as
he
thought
of
this
two
large
tears
rolled
down
his
sunburnt
cheeks
what
is
it
my
boy
he
brushed
them
away
hastily
father
said
he
i
been
a
sneak
but
i
be
a
coward
i
was
going
with
the
boys
last
night
ah
yes
i
should
have
gone
if
it
had
been
for
the
dog
and
the
cat
and
all
the
rest
of
them
was
any
goodness
of
mine
that
kept
me
at
home
his
father
was
silent
i
wish
you
say
something
father
cried
poor
bert
impatiently
i
you
do
think
i
worth
flogging
but
my
dear
boy
said
his
father
i
knew
your
footsteps
in
the
shed
last
night
i
knew
perfectly
well
who
was
hidden
in
the
old
closet
why
did
you
say
so
inquired
astonished
bert
tremblingly
because
i
preferred
to
let
you
go
i
thought
if
my
boy
wanted
to
deceive
me
he
should
at
least
imagine
that
he
had
that
pleasure
o
father
yes
you
should
have
gone
bert
very
likely
i
might
have
gone
with
you
but
you
would
not
have
known
it
bert
had
a
word
to
say
i
pitied
you
too
i
knew
that
after
the
fun
was
over
there
must
come
the
settling
with
your
conscience
i
was
sure
you
had
a
conscience
bert
the
boy
tried
to
speak
but
no
words
came
i
was
disappointed
in
you
bert
i
was
very
much
disappointed
in
you
down
went
bert
head
into
his
hands
but
now
continued
his
father
placing
one
hand
upon
his
shoulder
now
i
have
my
honest
boy
again
and
i
am
proud
of
him
i
do
consider
you
worth
a
dozen
floggings
bert
but
i
have
no
disposition
to
give
them
to
you
bert
wrung
his
father
hand
and
rushed
out
into
the
rain
cuff
came
running
to
meet
him
and
prince
barked
with
pleasure
at
his
approach
billy
whistled
and
sung
in
his
cage
above
and
old
snow
voice
was
heard
in
the
field
close
by
bert
loved
them
and
they
knew
it
it
was
some
minutes
however
before
he
noticed
them
now
and
when
he
did
it
was
not
in
his
accustomed
merry
way
just
like
the
monitors
at
school
said
he
seriously
making
such
a
fuss
that
a
fellow
ca
go
wrong
if
he
wants
to
and
he
took
cuff
up
in
his
lap
and
patted
prince
shaggy
coat
bert
monitors
still
watch
him
with
affectionate
interest
but
never
again
i
am
happy
to
say
has
he
felt
the
least
inclination
to
disturb
their
midnight
slumbers
a
morning
thought
with
every
rising
of
the
sun
think
of
your
life
as
just
begun
the
past
has
shrivelled
and
buried
deep
all
yesterdays
there
let
them
sleep
nor
seek
to
summon
back
one
ghost
of
that
innumerable
host
concern
yourself
with
but
woo
it
and
teach
it
to
obey
your
will
and
wish
since
time
began
has
been
the
friend
of
man
but
in
his
blindness
and
his
sorrow
he
looks
to
yesterday
and
illustration
the
pile
of
bills
on
the
counting
room
the
two
clerks
boys
are
apt
to
think
that
their
parents
and
teachers
are
too
strict
that
they
ought
not
to
be
obliged
to
get
such
perfect
lessons
or
to
go
to
sabbath
school
to
be
so
punctual
and
so
particular
they
wonder
why
they
are
not
allowed
a
great
many
amusements
and
indulgences
which
they
would
like
so
much
what
the
use
they
often
discontentedly
ask
well
boys
there
is
a
of
use
in
being
brought
up
right
and
the
discipline
which
sometimes
seems
to
you
so
hard
is
precisely
what
your
parents
see
that
you
need
in
order
to
make
you
worth
anything
i
will
tell
you
an
incident
to
illustrate
it
which
has
just
come
to
my
knowledge
william
was
the
oldest
child
of
a
widowed
mother
and
she
looked
upon
him
under
god
as
her
future
staff
and
support
he
was
trained
to
industrious
habits
and
in
the
fear
of
god
the
and
sabbath
school
seldom
saw
his
seat
vacant
idleness
that
rust
which
eats
into
character
had
no
opportunity
to
fasten
upon
him
by
and
by
he
got
through
school
and
succeeded
in
securing
a
situation
in
a
store
in
the
city
william
soon
found
himself
in
quite
altered
circumstances
the
stir
and
bustle
of
the
streets
was
very
unlike
the
quiet
of
his
village
home
then
the
tall
stores
loft
upon
loft
piled
with
goods
boxes
and
bales
now
instead
of
books
and
bat
the
strange
faces
of
the
clerks
and
the
easy
manners
and
handsome
appearance
of
the
rich
boy
ashton
just
above
him
in
the
store
all
these
contributed
not
a
little
to
his
sense
of
the
newness
and
strangeness
of
his
position
william
looked
at
ashton
almost
with
admiration
and
thought
how
new
and
awkward
everything
was
to
himself
and
how
tired
he
got
standing
so
many
hours
on
duty
and
crowding
his
way
through
the
busy
thoroughfares
but
his
good
habits
soon
made
him
many
friends
the
older
clerks
liked
his
obliging
and
active
spirit
and
all
had
a
good
word
for
his
punctuality
but
william
had
his
trials
one
morning
he
was
sent
to
the
bank
for
money
and
returning
laid
the
pile
on
the
counting
room
desk
his
master
was
gone
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
but
ashton
thomas
soon
came
back
two
dollars
are
missing
said
he
counting
the
money
the
blood
mounted
to
poor
william
face
but
he
answered
firmly
i
laid
it
all
on
your
desk
sir
thomas
looked
steadily
into
the
boy
face
and
seeing
nothing
but
an
honest
purpose
there
said
another
time
put
the
money
into
my
hands
my
boy
when
the
busy
season
came
on
one
of
the
head
clerks
was
taken
sick
and
william
rendered
himself
useful
to
the
bookkeeper
by
helping
him
add
some
of
his
tall
columns
oh
how
glad
he
was
now
for
his
drilling
in
arithmetic
as
the
bookkeeper
thanked
him
for
his
valuable
help
illustration
helped
the
ashton
often
asked
william
to
go
and
ride
or
to
visit
the
oyster
saloons
or
the
bowling
alley
or
the
theatre
to
all
invitations
of
this
kind
william
had
but
one
answer
he
always
said
he
had
no
time
or
money
to
spare
for
such
things
after
the
day
work
was
done
he
loved
to
get
back
to
his
chamber
to
read
he
did
not
crave
perpetual
excitement
or
any
more
eating
and
drinking
than
was
supplied
at
his
usual
meals
not
so
with
ashton
this
young
man
had
indulgent
parents
and
a
plenty
of
money
or
it
seemed
so
to
william
and
yet
he
ate
it
or
drank
it
or
spent
it
in
other
things
as
fast
and
so
soon
that
he
was
often
borrowing
from
the
other
clerks
ashton
joked
william
upon
his
stiff
notions
but
the
truth
was
that
william
was
far
the
happier
of
the
two
at
last
a
half
bale
of
goods
was
missing
searching
inquiries
were
made
and
the
theft
was
traced
to
ashton
o
the
shame
and
disgrace
of
the
discovery
but
alas
it
was
not
his
first
theft
ashton
had
been
in
the
habit
of
stealing
little
sums
in
order
to
get
the
means
to
gratify
his
taste
for
pleasure
and
now
that
his
guilt
had
come
to
light
he
ran
off
and
before
his
parents
were
aware
of
it
fled
to
a
far
country
an
outcast
from
his
beautiful
home
from
his
afflicted
friends
and
from
all
the
comforts
and
blessings
of
a
virtuous
life
william
is
rapidly
rising
in
the
confidence
and
respect
of
his
employers
fearing
god
and
faithful
in
duty

his

sleep
in
his
ten
minutes
delay
all
people
are
familiar
with
the
sad
account
of
the
death
of
the
young
prince
napoleon
who
fell
pierced
by
nineteen
wounds
at
the
hands
of
the
zulus
in
south
africa
june
many
will
remember
that
capt
carey
in
his
published
report
mentioned
that
after
they
had
selected
the
camping
ground
the
object
for
which
the
squad
of
six
had
been
detailed
and
had
had
coffee
and
rested
he
suggested
that
they
should
remount
and
return
to
camp
but
the
young
prince
who
commanded
the
squad
said
no
let
wait
ten
minutes
just
as
they
were
preparing
to
remount
at
the
expiration
of
that
ten
minutes
a
body
of
zulus
came
on
them
and
all
fled
but
the
prince
whose
horse
broke
from
him
after
a
desperate
resistance
he
fell
covered
with
wounds
and
died
in
the
tall
grass
of
the
douga
i
presume
all
do
not
know
that
this
pleading
for
ten
minutes
delay
was
a
habit
of
the
young
prince
from
early
childhood
a
correspondent
of
a
leading
paris
journal
interviewed
the
empress
as
she
was
about
leaving
for
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
that
had
wrecked
all
her
earthly
hopes
and
drew
her
into
conversation
on
the
subject
of
her
son
she
talked
freely
during
the
interview
but
with
an
evident
anguish
of
spirit
which
seemed
only
the
more
sad
from
her
effort
at
control
during
this
interview
while
speaking
of
the
childhood
of
her
son
the
prince
she
unconsciously
revealed
the
trait
in
his
character
that
had
caused
all
this
woe
to
her
wrecked
hopes
and
a
broken
heart
to
him
the
probable
loss
of
a
throne
an
earthly
future
and
his
life
after
describing
her
as
still
lovely
in
her
lonely
grief
the
writer
from
whom
we
quote
said
the
empress
had
now
risen
and
stood
slightly
trembling
with
emotion
when
stepping
rapidly
and
gracefully
across
the
room
she
opened
a
cabinet
from
which
she
took
a
pocketbook
and
read
therefrom
on
a
leaf
with
carey
the
last
words
ever
written
by
the
prince
then
she
added
all
that
captain
carey
has
ever
written
in
regard
to
my
son
those
fatal
ten
minutes
alone
i
hold
to
be
true
it
was
ever
his
habit
she
continued
plead
for
ten
minutes
delay
so
much
so
that
i
used
to
tell
him
they
ought
to
call
him
monsieur
dix
minutes
always
begged
for
ten
minutes
more
sleep
in
the
morning
ten
minutes
more
at
night
to
sleep
in
his
chair
and
when
too
much
overcome
with
sleep
to
speak
he
would
hold
up
his
two
little
hands
the
ten
fingers
representing
the
ten
minutes
more
for
which
he
pleaded
the
habit
of
procrastination
is
a
deadly
foe
to
all
prosperity
in
temporal
or
in
moral
affairs
we
ought
to
do
every
duty
as
soon
as
it
can
be
done
i
have
a
secret
which
i
should
like
to
whisper
to
the
boys
and
girls
if
they
will
put
their
ears
down
close
enough
i
do
want
father
and
mother
to
hear
for
it
is
to
be
a
surprise
on
them
you
have
long
wanted
your
own
way
you
have
become
tired
of
hearing
mother
say
come
right
home
after
school
do
be
late
be
sure
to
tell
the
teacher
it
is
do
this
and
do
do
that
all
the
time
you
are
sick
of
it
and
would
like
to
have
your
own
way
well
put
your
ears
down
while
i
whisper
one
word
obey
oh
you
think
i
am
making
fun
no
i
am
not
i
know
a
boy
who
decided
to
do
just
what
his
father
said
he
never
offered
excuses
never
tried
to
get
out
of
work
until
finally
his
father
came
to
trust
him
perfectly
his
father
said
i
know
that
harlie
will
do
what
is
right
when
he
went
out
nights
or
to
school
or
to
play
his
father
never
said
a
word
for
he
had
come
to
have
perfect
confidence
in
his
boy
honestly
obedience
is
the
road
to
freedom
if
you
want
to
have
your
own
way
just
begin
to
obey
illustration
the
premium
i
think
i
am
sure
of
one
premium
at
least
said
edward
as
he
stood
among
his
schoolfellows
it
was
examination
day
and
many
a
young
heart
was
beating
quick
with
the
hope
of
approbation
and
reward
or
with
the
fear
of
disgrace
some
had
looked
forward
to
this
day
and
applied
to
their
tasks
knowing
how
carefully
they
would
be
examined
and
commended
or
punished
according
as
they
deserved
others
had
chosen
to
forget
that
such
a
day
must
come
and
idled
away
the
time
which
they
would
now
have
given
a
great
deal
to
have
at
their
disposal
again
in
the
center
of
the
schoolroom
was
placed
a
long
table
covered
with
books
of
various
sizes
and
of
different
value
there
were
bibles
and
testaments
both
large
and
small
the
histories
of
rome
of
greece
and
of
england
there
were
volumes
elegantly
bound
and
pamphlets
just
stitched
together
the
school
was
extensive
and
it
was
desired
that
every
one
who
had
exerted
himself
to
the
best
of
his
ability
however
little
that
might
be
should
carry
home
with
him
some
mark
of
encouragement
to
remind
him
that
diligence
and
perseverance
were
not
overlooked
like
the
servants
to
whom
the
lord
intrusted
the
talents
some
had
five
and
some
had
but
one
yet
these
last
could
not
be
excused
for
hiding
and
neglecting
it
because
it
was
small
even
the
youngest
and
the
simplest
child
at
school
may
make
something
of
the
reason
and
opportunities
which
the
lord
has
given
him
to
improve
with
anxious
hearts
and
earnest
faces
the
boys
arranged
themselves
around
the
table
and
were
examined
with
great
care
and
patience
by
their
teachers
as
to
the
progress
they
had
made
in
their
studies
now
edward
had
set
his
heart
on
one
particular
premium
the
roman
history
neatly
bound
and
making
two
very
pretty
volumes
which
he
thought
would
handsomely
fill
up
a
vacant
space
on
his
he
allowed
himself
to
think
of
this
until
no
other
prize
was
of
any
value
in
his
sight
this
is
a
great
fault
often
committed
by
children
and
grown
people
too
instead
of
thankfully
receiving
whatever
the
bounty
of
providence
assigns
them
they
would
choose
for
themselves
they
become
discontented
and
unhappy
in
the
midst
of
blessings
because
the
wisdom
of
god
sees
fit
to
withhold
some
one
thing
that
their
folly
deems
necessary
to
their
happiness
edward
passed
his
examination
with
much
credit
and
one
of
the
first
premiums
was
adjudged
to
him
but
instead
of
the
roman
history
a
very
neat
bible
in
excellent
large
type
was
placed
in
his
hands
illustration
teacher
presents
the
many
of
his
had
longed
for
that
bible
but
edward
did
not
care
for
it
the
eyes
of
the
foolish
boy
filled
with
tears
as
he
saw
the
elegant
history
of
rome
presented
to
another
who
perhaps
would
gladly
have
exchanged
with
him
the
next
day
edward
returned
home
and
related
his
disappointment
to
his
parents
who
thought
his
desire
for
the
roman
history
a
mark
of
great
learning
and
taste
but
since
he
had
distinguished
himself
so
well
they
did
not
much
care
what
prize
he
received
edward
father
lived
in
the
country
not
far
from
the
seaside
in
a
most
delightful
and
healthful
situation
at
this
time
his
mother
brother
whose
health
was
very
poor
came
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
the
sea
breezes
and
rest
a
little
from
the
toil
and
bustle
of
active
life
in
london
lewis
was
a
young
man
of
the
most
pleasing
manners
and
appearance
he
was
gentle
and
serious
but
not
at
all
gloomy
or
severe
his
bad
health
only
served
to
increase
his
patience
in
enduring
it
without
a
murmuring
word
or
discontented
look
edward
who
was
really
a
and
affectionate
boy
soon
became
very
much
attached
to
his
uncle
who
had
not
seen
him
since
he
was
an
infant
and
who
was
much
pleased
at
the
attentions
his
nephew
delighted
to
show
him
young
hearts
are
soon
won
and
it
was
only
three
days
after
return
from
school
that
he
went
bounding
over
the
grounds
in
search
of
his
uncle
whose
society
he
already
preferred
to
his
usual
amusements
lewis
was
seated
under
a
fine
old
oak
the
high
and
knotted
roots
of
which
served
as
a
seat
while
the
soft
moss
in
which
grew
many
delicate
little
flowers
was
like
a
carpet
beneath
his
feet
a
rich
and
extensive
tract
of
country
lay
spread
before
his
eyes
and
at
a
distance
the
mighty
ocean
whose
deep
green
waters
were
seen
in
beautiful
contrast
with
the
pale
yellow
cliff
bounded
the
prospect
illustration
that
a
bible
thin
clouds
were
floating
past
the
sun
every
now
and
then
and
threw
all
the
varieties
of
light
and
shade
upon
the
lovely
scene
below
lewis
had
a
book
in
his
hand
into
which
he
frequently
looked
and
then
raised
his
eyes
again
to
gaze
upon
the
beauties
of
nature
that
surrounded
him
so
intent
he
seemed
that
edward
doubted
whether
he
ought
to
disturb
him
until
his
uncle
seeing
him
at
some
little
distance
kindly
beckoned
him
to
come
near
is
not
this
a
pretty
place
uncle
asked
edward
as
he
seated
himself
beside
him
and
do
you
not
find
the
breeze
from
the
water
very
refreshing
it
is
beautiful
indeed
my
dear
boy
and
i
am
refreshed
and
instructed
as
i
look
around
me
illustration
holy
is
that
a
bible
uncle
yes
i
always
find
it
the
best
commentary
upon
his
works
they
explain
each
other
i
love
the
bible
too
uncle
said
edward
and
got
much
credit
for
my
answering
on
scripture
questions
last
and
which
did
you
enjoy
most
edward
the
scriptures
or
the
credit
you
got
for
studying
them
edward
looked
a
little
embarrassed
and
did
not
immediately
reply
it
is
quite
right
to
take
pleasure
in
the
approbation
of
your
teachers
continued
lewis
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
you
were
given
a
premium
at
the
last
examination
also
yes
uncle
but
not
the
prize
i
wanted
most
there
was
a
roman
history
that
i
should
have
liked
better
and
it
was
exactly
of
equal
value
with
the
bible
that
i
got
of
equal
value
edward
i
mean
that
it
was
not
reckoned
a
higher
prize
and
it
would
have
been
a
nicer
book
for
me
then
you
had
a
bible
already
why
no
uncle
not
of
my
own
but
it
is
easy
to
borrow
one
on
the
sabbath
and
i
had
gone
through
all
my
scripture
proofs
and
do
not
want
it
on
other
days
read
these
four
verses
for
me
said
lewis
pointing
to
the
sixth
chapter
of
deuteronomy
commencing
with
the
sixth
verse
edward
read
and
these
words
which
i
command
thee
this
day
shall
be
in
thine
heart
and
thou
shalt
teach
them
diligently
unto
thy
children
and
shalt
talk
of
them
when
thou
sittest
in
thine
house
and
when
thou
walkest
by
the
way
and
when
thou
liest
down
and
when
thou
risest
up
and
thou
shalt
bind
them
for
a
sign
upon
thine
hand
and
they
shall
be
as
frontlets
between
thine
eyes
and
thou
shalt
write
them
upon
the
posts
of
thy
house
and
on
thy
gates
to
whom
did
the
lord
give
this
command
edward
to
the
jews
uncle
yes
and
the
word
of
god
which
can
not
pass
away
is
as
much
binding
on
us
as
on
them
in
everything
excepting
the
sacrifices
and
ceremonies
which
foreshowed
the
coming
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
which
were
done
away
for
by
his
death
he
fulfilled
all
those
types
and
shadows
then
said
edward
we
are
commanded
to
write
the
bible
on
our
hands
and
on
our
doorposts
no
my
dear
boy
not
literally
but
in
a
figure
of
speech
as
the
lord
when
declaring
he
never
will
forget
zion
says
have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me
the
meaning
of
the
passage
you
first
read
is
that
we
must
have
the
word
of
god
as
continually
present
in
our
minds
as
anything
written
on
our
hands
and
on
every
object
around
us
would
be
to
our
bodily
sight
and
how
are
we
to
get
our
thoughts
so
occupied
by
it
edward
by
continually
reading
it
i
suppose
replied
edward
rather
sullenly
by
reading
it
often
and
meditating
on
it
much
said
his
uncle
and
that
we
can
do
without
interfering
with
our
other
business
without
prayer
you
can
not
obtain
any
spiritual
blessing
nor
maintain
any
communion
with
god
and
without
reading
the
scriptures
you
will
have
but
little
desire
to
pray
we
are
like
people
wandering
in
the
dark
while
the
bible
is
as
a
bright
lamp
held
out
to
direct
us
in
the
only
safe
path
you
can
not
be
a
child
of
god
if
you
do
not
his
will
you
can
not
do
it
unless
you
know
it
and
it
is
by
the
bible
that
he
is
pleased
to
have
that
knowledge
known
do
you
begin
to
see
edward
that
the
bible
is
more
suitable
as
an
book
than
your
profane
history
why
yes
uncle
but
the
bible
is
a
serious
book
and
if
i
read
it
so
constantly
i
never
should
be
merry
illustration
there
is
no
merriment
among
the
lost
edward
and
that
dreadful
lot
will
be
your
portion
if
you
neglect
the
great
salvation
which
the
scriptures
set
forth
besides
there
is
no
foundation
for
what
you
suppose
to
be
the
effect
of
reading
the
bible
i
have
known
people
naturally
melancholy
and
discontented
become
cheerful
and
happy
by
studying
it
but
i
never
in
my
life
saw
an
instance
of
persons
becoming
unhappy
because
they
had
a
hope
of
going
to
heaven
i
remember
uncle
that
it
is
written
concerning
wisdom
that
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
and
all
her
paths
are
peace
most
true
my
dear
boy
and
assurance
forever
is
the
portion
of
god
people
in
the
lord
alway
and
again
i
say
rejoice
illustration
ransomed
of
the
lord
shall
return
and
come
to
zion
with
songs
and
everlasting
joy
upon
their
heads
they
shall
obtain
joy
and
gladness
and
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
flee
away
are
such
expressions
as
these
likely
to
make
us
gloomy
edward
o
no
uncle
and
i
often
wonder
that
you
who
suffer
so
much
pain
and
read
the
bible
constantly
are
not
melancholy
how
can
i
be
melancholy
edward
when
the
bible
tells
me
that
all
these
things
are
working
together
for
my
spiritual
good
that
he
who
spared
not
his
own
son
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
all
will
with
him
also
freely
give
us
all
things
when
i
think
of
what
my
sins
deserve
and
see
the
lamb
of
god
bearing
the
chastisement
that
should
fall
upon
me
how
can
i
be
melancholy
when
i
feel
that
the
spirit
of
god
is
bringing
these
things
to
my
remembrance
and
enabling
me
to
love
the
lord
jesus
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
must
i
not
rejoice
i
know
that
in
me
that
is
in
my
flesh
dwelleth
no
good
thing
and
since
god
has
promised
forgiveness
to
all
who
seek
that
blessing
through
his
son
and
since
i
feel
assured
that
i
have
sought
that
blessing
and
feel
peace
and
joy
in
believing
surely
the
song
of
praise
not
the
moan
of
lamentation
becomes
me
yet
i
do
lament
edward
daily
lament
my
many
offenses
against
god
but
i
am
assured
that
christ
blood
cleanseth
from
all
sin
and
that
in
him
i
have
a
powerful
and
advocate
with
the
father
i
know
in
whom
i
have
believed
and
that
he
will
never
cast
off
nor
forsake
me
i
am
sinking
into
the
grave
my
dear
boy
but
i
do
not
shrink
from
that
prospect
because
the
bitterness
of
death
is
taken
away
by
my
saviour
who
died
for
my
sins
and
rose
again
for
my
justification
and
though
this
body
returns
to
dust
i
shall
live
again
and
enter
into
the
presence
of
my
redeemer
and
rejoice
there
evermore
edward
looked
at
the
animated
countenance
of
his
uncle
and
then
cast
down
his
eyes
they
were
full
of
tears
at
last
he
said
indeed
uncle
i
am
a
very
sinful
boy
neglecting
the
bible
because
i
know
it
would
show
me
my
sin
and
the
consequences
of
it
but
i
will
trifle
no
more
with
god
displeasure
i
will
get
that
precious
bible
worth
a
thousand
roman
histories
and
i
will
read
it
daily
with
prayer
that
i
may
be
wise
unto
salvation
lewis
did
not
live
long
after
this
he
died
rejoicing
in
hope
of
life
eternal
and
as
often
as
edward
was
allowed
to
return
home
from
school
he
was
to
be
seen
under
the
oak
tree
with
the
bible
in
his
hand
from
which
he
learned
more
and
more
the
will
of
his
god
and
saviour
the
utter
sinfulness
of
his
own
nature
and
his
inability
to
help
himself
from
this
holy
word
he
learned
to
place
all
his
dependence
upon
the
merits
of
his
saviour
to
follow
the
example
of
his
saviour
in
prayer
in
resignation
and
in
doing
good
to
the
poor
he
often
thought
of
his
dear
uncle
and
counted
that
day
happy
when
he
sat
to
listen
to
his
kind
advice
which
brought
him
to
a
knowledge
of
himself
and
of
his
heavenly
father
lessons
from
the
psalm
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet
and
a
light
unto
my
path
thou
through
thy
commandments
hast
made
me
wiser
than
mine
enemies
i
have
more
understanding
than
all
my
teachers
for
thy
testimonies
are
my
meditation
i
understand
more
than
the
ancients
because
i
keep
thy
precepts
illustration
study
two
hours
before
where
the
gold
is
tom
jones
was
a
little
fellow
and
not
so
quick
to
learn
as
some
boys
but
nobody
in
the
class
could
beat
him
in
his
lessons
he
rarely
missed
in
geography
never
in
spelling
and
his
arithmetic
was
always
correctly
done
as
for
his
reading
no
boy
improved
like
him
the
boys
were
fairly
angry
sometimes
he
outdid
them
so
why
tom
where
do
you
learn
your
lessons
you
do
study
in
school
more
than
the
other
boys
i
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
study
two
hours
before
breakfast
answered
tom
ah
that
is
it
the
morning
hour
has
gold
in
its
mouth
there
is
a
little
garden
near
us
which
is
the
prettiest
and
most
plentiful
little
spot
in
all
the
neighborhood
the
earliest
radishes
peas
strawberries
and
tomatoes
grow
there
it
supplies
the
family
with
vegetables
besides
some
for
the
market
if
anybody
wants
flowers
that
garden
is
the
place
to
go
for
the
sweetest
roses
pinks
and
all
sorts
without
number
the
soil
we
used
to
think
was
poor
and
rocky

being
exposed
to
the

he

how
do
you
make
so
much
out
of
your
little
garden
i
give
my
mornings
to
it

the

william
down
was
one
of
our
young
converts
he
united
with
the
church
and
appeared
well
but
i
pitied
the
poor
fellow
when
i
thought
of
his
going
back
to
the
shipyard
to
work
among
a
gang
of
godless
associates
will
he
maintain
his
stand
i
thought
it
is
so
easy
to
slip
back
in
religion
easier
to
go
back
two
steps
than
advance
one
ah
well
we
said
we
must
trust
william
to
his
conscience
and
his
saviour
two
years
passed
and
instead
of
william
losing
ground
his
piety
grew
brighter
and
stronger
others
fell
away
but
not
he
and
no
boy
perhaps
was
placed
in
more
unfavorable
circumstances
talking
with
william
one
evening
i
discovered
one
secret
of
his
steadfastness
i
never
sir
on
any
account
let
a
single
morning
pass
without
secret
prayer
and
the
reading
of
god
word
if
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
i
rise
an
hour
earlier
i
think
over
my
weak
points
and
try
to
get
grace
to
fortify
me
just
there
mark
this
prayer
is
armor
for
the
battle
of
life
if
you
give
up
your
morning
petitions
you
will
suffer
for
it
temptation
is
before
you
and
you
are
not
fit
to
meet
it
there
is
a
guilty
feeling
in
the
soul
and
you
keep
at
a
distance
from
christ
be
sure
the
hour
of
prayer
broken
in
upon
by
sleepiness
can
never
be
made
up
make
it
a
principle
young
christian
to
begin
the
day
by
watching
unto
prayer
the
morning
hour
has
gold
in
its
mouth
aye
and
something
better
than
gold
heavenly

illustration
early
morning
illustration
do
you
take
that
fellow
in
taking
him
in
hand
two
boys
met
in
the
street
and
the
following
conversation
ensued
isaac
said
george
why
do
you
take
that
fellow
in
hand
he
has
insulted
you
almost
every
day
for
a
week
i
mean
to
take
him
in
hand
said
isaac
i
would
make
him
stop
if
i
had
to
take
his
ears
off
i
mean
to
make
him
stop
go
and
flog
him
now
i
should
like
to
see
you
do
it
you
can
do
it
easily
enough
with
one
hand
i
rather
think
i
could
but
i
not
try
it
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
the
parted
as
they
were
on
their
way
home
and
their
roads
led
them
in
different
directions
the
boy
alluded
to
was
the
son
of
an
intemperate
man
who
was
angry
with
isaac
father
in
consequence
of
some
effort
to
prevent
his
obtaining
rum
the
drunkard
son
took
up
the
cause
of
his
father
and
called
isaac
hard
names
every
time
he
saw
him
pass
and
as
he
did
not
do
anything
by
way
of
retaliation
he
went
farther
and
threw
stones
at
him
isaac
was
at
first
provoked
at
the
boy
conduct
he
thought
he
ought
to
be
thankful
that
his
father
was
prevented
in
some
degree
from
procuring
rum
the
source
of
so
much
misery
to
himself
and
family
but
when
he
thought
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
of
the
poor
lad
ignorance
and
wretchedness
he
pitied
him
and
ceased
to
wonder
or
to
be
offended
at
his
conduct
but
isaac
resolved
indeed
to
take
him
in
hand
and
to
stop
him
but
not
in
the
sense
in
which
his
schoolfellow
understood
those
terms
the
boy
name
was
james
but
he
was
never
called
anything
but
jim
indeed
if
you
were
to
call
him
by
his
true
name
he
would
think
you
meant
somebody
else
the
first
opportunity
isaac
had
of
taking
him
in
hand
was
on
election
day
on
that
day
as
isaac
was
on
his
way
home
he
saw
a
group
of
boys
a
little
off
the
road
and
heard
some
shouting
and
laughing
curiosity
led
him
to
the
spot
he
found
that
the
boys
were
gathered
around
jim
and
another
boy
a
good
deal
larger
than
he
was
this
boy
was
making
fun
of
jim
clothes
which
were
indeed
very
ragged
and
dirty
and
telling
how
he
must
act
to
become
as
distinguished
a
man
as
his
father
jim
was
very
angry
but
when
he
attempted
to
strike
his
persecutor
he
would
take
hold
of
jim
hands
and
he
was
so
much
stronger
that
he
could
easily
hold
them
jim
then
tried
kicking
but
as
he
was
barefoot
he
could
not
do
much
execution
in
that
line
besides
while
he
was
using
one
foot
in
this
way
his
tormentor
would
tread
upon
the
other
with
his
heavy
boot
illustration
remonstrated
with
the
when
isaac
came
up
and
saw
what
was
going
on
he
remonstrated
with
the
boys
for
countenancing
such
proceedings
and
such
was
his
influence
and
the
force
of
truth
that
most
of
them
agreed
that
it
was
too
bad
though
he
was
such
an
ugly
boy
they
said
that
he
was
hardly
worth
pitying
the
principal
actor
however
did
not
like
isaac
interference
but
he
soon
saw
that
isaac
was
not
afraid
of
him
and
that
he
was
too
popular
with
the
boys
to
be
made
the
object
of
abuse
as
he
turned
to
go
away
isaac
said
to
jim
i
keep
my
eyes
upon
you
and
when
you
go
home
i
go
with
you
it
is
on
my
way
they
sha
hurt
you
so
do
cry
any
more
come
jim
go
home
with
me
i
going
now
continued
isaac
jim
did
not
look
up
or
make
any
answer
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
isaac
behavior
toward
him
it
could
not
be
because
he
was
afraid
of
him
and
wished
to
gain
his
good
will
for
isaac
was
not
afraid
of
one
much
stronger
than
he
he
had
never
heard
of
the
command
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
for
he
had
never
been
to
sabbath
school
and
could
not
read
the
bible
he
followed
silently
and
sullenly
pretty
near
to
isaac
till
he
had
reached
home
if
that
sacred
name
can
with
propriety
be
applied
to
such
a
wretched
abode
of
sin
and
misery
he
parted
from
isaac
without
thanking
him
for
his
good
offices
in
his
behalf
this
isaac
did
not
wonder
at
considering
the
influences
under
which
the
poor
lad
had
grown
up
that
he
parted
with
him
without
abusing
him
isaac
considered
as
something
gained
the
next
morning
george
and
isaac
met
on
their
way
to
school
as
they
passed
the
drunkard
dwelling
jim
was
at
the
door
but
he
did
not
look
up
or
say
anything
as
they
passed
he
looked
very
much
as
though
he
had
been
whipped
george
did
not
know
what
had
taken
place
the
day
before
what
keeps
jim
so
still
said
he
oh
i
had
him
in
hand
illustration
was
at
the
door
but
he
did
not
look
up
or
say
have
you
i
glad
of
it
when
was
it
yesterday
at
election
yes
anybody
see
you
do
it
yes
some
of
the
boys
found
it
easy
enough
did
you
yes
did
you
give
him
enough
to
stop
him
i
guess
so
he
is
pretty
still
this
morning
you
see
upon
the
strength
of
this
conversation
george
circulated
a
report
that
isaac
had
flogged
jim
this
created
a
good
deal
of
surprise
as
it
was
not
in
keeping
with
isaac
character
the
report
at
length
reached
the
ears
of
the
teacher
he
inquired
about
the
matter
of
isaac
and
learned
that
george
had
been
deceived
or
rather
had
deceived
himself
he
warmly
commended
isaac
for
his
new
mode
of
taking
his
enemies
in
hand
and
advised
him
to
continue
to
practice
it
a
few
days
afterward
as
isaac
was
on
his
way
to
school
he
met
jim
driving
some
cattle
to
a
distant
field
the
cattle
were
very
unruly
and
jim
made
little
headway
with
them
first
one
would
run
back
and
then
another
till
he
began
to
despair
of
being
able
to
drive
them
to
pasture
illustration
cattle
were
very
he
burst
out
crying
and
said
oh
dear
i
ca
make
them
go
and
father
will
kill
me
if
i
do
isaac
pitied
his
distress
and
volunteered
to
assist
him
it
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
running
and
kept
him
from
school
nearly
all
the
morning
but
when
the
cattle
were
safe
in
the
pasture
jim
said
i
sha
stone
you
any
more
when
isaac
reached
the
schoolhouse
he
showed
signs
of
the
violent
exercise
he
had
been
taking
what
has
isaac
been
about
was
the
whispered
question
which
went
round
when
put
to
him
he
replied
i
have
been
chasing
cattle
to
pasture
he
was
understood
to
mean
his
father
cattle
after
school
he
waited
till
all
the
pupils
had
left
the
schoolroom
before
he
went
up
to
the
teacher
to
give
his
excuse
for
being
late
at
school
what
made
you
so
late
asked
the
teacher
i
was
taking
jim
in
hand
again
sir
and
he
gave
him
an
account
of
his
proceeding
adding
at
the
close
i
thought
you
would
excuse
me
sir
very
well
you
are
excused
reader
if
you
have
enemies
who
annoy
you
them
in
in
the
same
way
that
isaac
did
and
you
will
be
certain
if
you
persevere
to
conquer
them
illustration
the
printer
overworked
boys
the
boys
of
our
time
are
too
much
afraid
of
work
they
act
as
if
the
honest
sweat
of
the
brow
was
something
to
be
ashamed
of
would
that
they
were
all
equally
afraid
of
a
staggering
gait
and
bloated
face
this
spirit
of
laziness
builds
the
gambling
houses
fills
the
jails
supplies
the
saloons
and
gaming
places
with
loiterers
and
keeps
the
alms
houses
and
charitable
institutions
doing
a
brisk
business
it
does
build
mammoth
stores
and
factories
nor
buildings
like
the
astor
library
and
cooper
institute
the
men
who
built
such
monuments
of
their
industry
and
benevolence
were
not
afraid
of
work
all
the
boys
have
heard
of
the
great
publishing
house
of
the
harpers
they
know
of
their
finely
illustrated
papers
and
books
of
all
kinds
and
perhaps
have
seen
their
great
publishing
house
in
new
york
city
but
if
i
should
ask
the
boys
how
the
eldest
of
the
brothers
came
to
found
such
an
illustrious
house
i
should
perhaps
be
told
that
he
was
a
wonderfully
lucky
man
he
was
lucky
and
an
old
friend
and
a
leading
editor
has
revealed
the
secret
of
his
luck
he
and
the
elder
harper
learned
their
trade
together
many
years
ago
in
john
street
new
york
they
began
life
with
no
fortune
but
willing
hands
and
active
brains

any
young

break
the
back
of

sometimes
after
we
had
done
a
good
day
work
james
harper
would
say
let
break
the
back
of
another
a
quarter
of
a
ream
of
paper
just
break
its
back
i
would
generally
reluctantly
consent
just
to
the
of

james
would
beguile
me
or
laugh
at
my
complaints
and
never
let
me
off
until
the
was
fair
and
square
it
was
our
custom
in
summer
to
do
a
fair
work
before
the
other
boys
and
men
got
their
breakfast
we
would
meet
by
appointment
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
and
go
down
to
john
street
we
got
the
key
of
the
office
by
tapping
on
the
window
and
seymour
would
take
it
from
under
his
pillow
and
hand
it
to
one
of
us
through
the
blind
it
kept
us
out
of
mischief
and
put
money
into
our
pockets
the
key
handed
through
the
window
tells
the
secret
of
the
that
enabled
these
two
men
to
rise
to
eminence
while
so
many
boys
that
lay
soundly
sleeping
in
those
busy
morning
hours
are
unknown
no
wonder
that
james
harper
became
mayor
of
the
city
and
head
of
one
of
the
largest
publishing
houses
in
the
world
when
his
great
printing
house
burned
down
the
giant
perseverance
which
he
had
learned
in
those
hours
of
made
him
able
to
raise
from
the
ashes
a
larger
and
finer
one
instead
of
watching
till
his
employer
back
was
turned
and
saying
come
boys
let
go
home
we
done
enough
for
one
day
and
sauntering
off
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
his
cry
was
let
do
a
little
that
which
frightens
boys
nowadays
out
of
good
places

them
out

such
busy
boys
were
only
too
glad
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
soundly
they
had
no
time
nor
spare
strength
for
dissipation
and
idle
thoughts
and
vulgar
conversation
almost
the
last
words
that
james
harper
uttered
were
appropriate
to
the
end
of
such
a
life
and
ought
to
be
engraven
upon
the
mind
of
every
boy
who
expects
to
make
anything

himself

not

little
we
can

what

do
inquired
several
impatient

shall
see

the

as
they
approached

home

said
charlie
you
see
that
pile
of
wood
a
man
hauled
it
here
this
afternoon

i
heard
more
tell
him
that
unless
she
got
some
one
to

it
she
would
have
nothing
to
make
a
fire
with
in
the
morning
now
we
can
saw
and
split
that
pile
of
wood
just
about
as
easy
as
we
could
build
a
great
snow
man
and
when
more
comes
home
from
her
watching
she
will
be
fully
as
much
surprised
to
find
her
wood
sawed
as
she
would
to
find
a
snow
man
at
her
doorstep
and
a
great
deal
more
pleasantly
too
what
say
you
will

do
it
one
or
two
of
the
boys
demurred
at
first
but
the
majority
were
in
favor
of

so
all
finally
joined
in
and
went
to
work
with
a
will

go
round
to
the
back
of
the
shed

charley

crawl
through
the
window
and
unfasten
the
door
then
we
take
turns
in
sawing

and
carrying
in
the
wood
and
i
want
to
pile
it
up
nicely
and
to
shovel
all
the
snow
away
from
the
door
and
make
a
good
wide
path
too
from
the
door
to
the
street

fun
it
will
be
when

comes
home

the
satisfaction

always

seven
robust

healthy
boys

up
the
poor
widow

wood

to
shovel
a
good
path
when
it
was
done
so
great
was
their
pleasure
that
one
of
the
boys
who
objected
to
the
work
at
first
proposed
that
they
should
go
to
a
neighboring
carpenter
shop
where
plenty
of
shavings
could
be
had
for
the
carrying
away
and
each
bring
an
armful
of
kindling
wood
this
they
did
and
afterward
hurried
home

of
them
more
than
satisfied
with
the
fun

from

the
influence
which
may
be
exerted
by
a
single
act

word
or
even

it
was
the
simple
act
of
an
entire
stranger
that
changed
the
course
of
my
whole
life
when
i
was
a
boy
my
father
moved
to
the
far
west
ohio
it
was
before
the
days
of
steam
and
no
great
mills
thundered
on
her
river
banks
but
occasionally
there
was
a
little
gristmill
by
the
side
of
some
small
stream
to
these
little
mills
the
surrounding
neighborhood
flocked
with
their
sacks
of
corn
sometimes
we
had
to
wait
two
or
three
days
for
our
turn
i
was
generally
the
one
sent
from
our
house
for
while
i
was
too
small
to
be
of
much
account
on
the
farm
i
was
as
good
as
a
man
to
carry
a
grist
to
mill
so
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
one
morning
when
my
father
said
henry
you
must
take
the
horse
and
go
to
mill
but
i
found
so
many
of
the
neighboring
farmers
there
ahead
of
me
that
i
knew
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
home
that
day
but
i
was
not
at
all
sorry
for
my
basket
was
well
filled
with
provisions
and
saunders
always
opened
his
big
barn
for
us
to
sleep
in
that
day
there
was
an
addition
to
the
number
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
gathering
from
time
to
time
in
the
old
saunders
barn
a
young
fellow
about
my
own
age
his
name
was
charley
allen
and
his
father
had
bought
a
farm
over
on
the
brush
creek
road
he
was
sociable
and
friendly
but
somehow
i
felt
that
he
had
more
manners
than
the
rest
of
us
the
evening
was
spent
as
usual
in
relating
coarse
jokes
and
playing
cards
although
i
was
not
accustomed
to
such
things
at
home
i
had
become
so
used
to
it
at
the
mill
that
it
had
long
since
ceased
to
shock
me
and
indeed
i
was
getting
to
enjoy
watching
the
games
of
the
others
when
bedtime
came
we
were
all
so
busy
with
our
own
affairs
that
we
did
not
notice
charley
allen
until
a
rude
profane
fellow
exclaimed
heyday
we
got
a
parson
here
sure
enough
charley
was
kneeling
by
the
oatbin
praying
but
the
jest
met
with
no
response
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
drowsy
cattle
below
and
the
twittering
swallows
overhead

than
one
rough
man
wiped
a
tear
from
his
eyes
as
he
went
silently
to
his
bed
on
the
hay
i
had
always
been
in
the
habit
of
praying
at
home
but
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
at
saunder
mill
as
i
laid
awake
that
night
in
the
old
barn
thinking
of
charley
courage
and
what
an
effect
it
had
upon
the
men
i
firmly
resolved
that
in
the
future
i
would
i
little

how
soon
my

would

tested

go
through
this
gate
just
after
dinner
i
got
my
grist
and
started
for
home
when
i
arrived
at
squire
albright
gate
where
i
turned
off
to
go
home
i
found
the
old
squire
waiting
for
me
i
saw
in
a
moment
that
something
had
gone
wrong
i
had
always
stood
in
the
greatest
awe
of
the
old
gentlemen
because
he
was
the
rich
man
of
the
neighborhood
and
now
i
felt
my
heart
beginning
to
beat
very
fast
as
soon
as
i
came
near
he
said
did
you
go
through
this
gate
yesterday
i
could
easily
have
denied
it
as
it
was
before
daylight
when
i
went
through
and
i
quite
as
often
went
the
other
way
but
the
picture
of
charley
allen
kneeling
in
the
barn
came
to
my
mind
like
a
flash
and
before
i
had
time
to
listen
to
the
tempter
i
replied
yes
sir
i
did
are
you
sure
you
shut
and
pinned
the
gate
he
asked
this
question
staggered
me
i
remembered
distinctly
that
i
did
not
i
could
pull
the
pin
out
without
getting
off
my
horse
but
i
could
not
put
it
in
again
so
i
carelessly
rode
away
and
left
it
open
i
i
i
out
with
it
tell
just
what
you
did
i
left
it
open
i
said
abruptly
well
you
let
the
cattle
in
and
they
have
destroyed
all
my
early
potatoes
a
terrible
piece
of
business
i
very
sorry
i
talking
wo
help
matters
now
but
remember
boy
remember
that
sorrow
does
make
potatoes
sorrow
does
make
potatoes
i
felt
very
bad
about
the
matter
for
i
was
really
sorry
that
the
old
gentleman
had
lost
his
potatoes
and
then
i
expected
to
be
severely
reproved
at
home
but
i
soon
found
that
they
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
and
after
several
days
had
passed
i
began
to
rest
quite
easy
alas
for
human
hopes
one
rainy
afternoon
i
saw
the
squire
riding
down
the
lane
i
ran
off
to
the
barn
ashamed
to
face
him
and
afraid
to
meet
my
father
they
sat
on
the
porch
and
talked
for
a
long
time
at
last
my
curiosity
overcame
my
fear
and
i
stole
back
to
the
house
and
went
into
mother
room
to
see
if
i
could
hear
what
they
were
talking
about
why
the
boy
could
be
spared
well
enough
but
he
does
know
anything
about
the
business
said
my
father
there
is
one
thing
he
does
know
said
the
squire
he
knows
how
to
tell
the
truth
he
then
related
the
circumstance
which
i
so
much
dreaded
to
have
my
father
hear
after
he
had
gone
my
father
called
me
to
him
and
told
me
that
the
squire
was
going
to
start
a
store
in
the
village
and
wanted
a
boy
to
help
and
that
i
could
go
if
i
wished
i
went
and
remained
in
the
village
store
until
it
became
a
city
store
people
say
that
i
got
my
start
in
life
when
i
entered

i
will
always
declare
that
i
got
it

in

the
lad
james
had
been
for
only
a

old
friend

a
man
in
whom
he
had
the
highest
confidence

had
always
looked
upon
him
as

kind

model
man

agreed
to
take
him
into

store
the
lad
felt
that
great
good
fortune
was
in
his
way
let
them
correct
their
own
mistakes
these
words
made
a
strong
impression
on
the
mind
of
james
lewis
when
first
spoken
by
carman
with
the
meaning
which
he
gave
them
as
we
have
said
he
felt
shocked
but
as
he
turned
them
over
again
in
his
thoughts
and
remembered
that
this
man
stood
very
high
in
his
mother
estimation
he
began
to
think
that
perhaps
the
thing
was
fair
enough
in
business
carman
was
hardly
the
man
to
do
wrong
a
few
days
after
james
had
examined
the
bill
a
clerk
from
the
house
which
had
sent
it
called
for
settlement
the
lad
who
was
present
waited
with
interest
to
see
whether
carman
would
speak
of
the
error
but
he
made
no
remark
a
check
for
the
amount
of
the
bill
as
rendered
was
filled
up
and
a
receipt
taken
is
that
right
james
asked
himself
this
question
his
conscience
said
no
the
fact
that
carman
had
so
acted
bewildered
his
mind
it
may
be
the
way
in
business
he
thought
to
himself
but
it
look
honest
i
would
have
believed
it
of
him
carman
had
a
way
with
him
that
won
the
boy
heart
and
naturally
tended
to
make
him
judge
of
whatever
he
might
do
in
a
most
favorable
manner
i
wish
he
had
corrected
that
error

said
to
himself
a
great
many
times
when
congratulating
himself
upon
his
own
good
fortune
in
having
been
received
into
carman
employment
it
does
look
right
but
it
be
in
the
way
of
business
one
day
he
went
to
the
bank
and
drew
the
money
for
a
check
in
counting
it
over
he
found
that
the
teller
had
paid
him
fifty
dollars
too
much
so
he
went
back
to
the
counter
and
told
him
of
his
mistake
the
teller
thanked
him
and
he
returned
to
the
store
with
the
consciousness
in
his
mind
of
having
done
right
the
teller
overpaid
me
fifty
dollars

said
to

he
handed
him
the
money

latter

breaking
over
his
countenance

he
hastily
counted
the

light
faded
as

left

no

james
a
tone
of

is
often
the
case
that
more
shame
is
felt
for
a
blunder
than
for
a
crime
in
this
instance
the
lad
felt
a
sort
of
mortification
at
having
done
what
carman
was
pleased
to
call
a
silly
thing
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
they
should
ever
him
a
thousand
dollars
at
the
bank
he
should
bring
the
amount
to
his
employer
and
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
with
the
money
let
people
look
out
for

james

pondered
these
things
in
his
heart
the
impression
they
made
was
too
strong
ever
to

said

did
not

satisfied

over

wages
just

from

he
saw
that
he
had
been

his
first
impulse
was
to
return
the
half

it
was
on

lips

say
you
have
given

too
much

about
this
said
james
as
he
put
the
money
into
his
pocket
if
it
is
right
in
one
case
it
is
right
in
another
carman
does
correct
mistakes
that
people
make
in
his
favor
and
he
complain
when
the
rule
works
against
himself
but
the
boy
was
very
far
from
being
comfortable
he
felt
that
to
keep
a
half
dollar
would
be
a
dishonest
act
still
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
return
it
at
least
not
then
james
did
not
return
the
but
spent
it
for
his
gratification
after
he
had
done
this
it
came
suddenly
into
his
head
that
carman
had
only
been
trying
him
and
he
was
filled
with
anxiety
and
alarm
not
long
after
this
carman
repeated
the
same
mistake
again
james
kept
the
and
with
less
hesitation
let
him
correct
his
own
mistakes
said
he
resolutely
that
the
doctrine
he
acts
upon
with
other
people
and
he
ca
complain
if
he
gets
paid
in
the
same
coin
he
puts
in
circulation
i
just
wanted
a
half
dollar
from
this
time
the
fine
moral
sense
of
james
lewis
was
blunted
and
his
conscience
troubled
him
but
little
he
began
to
cherish
a
spirit
of
covetousness
which
is
in
the
heart
of
all
until
subdued
by
the
grace
of
christ
he
soon
began
to
desire
the
possession
of
things
for
which
he
was
not
able
to
pay
james
had
good
business
qualifications
this
pleased
carman
he
saw
that
the
young
man
was
intelligent
industrious
and
tactful
with
customers
for
this
reason
he
advanced
him
rapidly
and
before
he
was
eighteen
years
of
age
he
held
the
most
responsible
position
in
the
store
but
james
had
learned
something
more
from
his
employer
than
the
secret
of
doing
business
well
he
had
learned
to
be
dishonest
he
had
never
forgotten
the
first
lesson
he
had
received
in
the
downward
course
and
this
wicked
instruction
he
had
acted
upon
not
only
in
two
instances
but
in
a
hundred
and
almost
always
to
the
injury
of
carman
the
young
man
had
long
since
given
up
waiting
for
mistakes
to
be
made
in
his
favor
he
originated
them
in
the
varied
and
complicated
transactions
of
a
large
business
in
which
he
was
trusted
implicity
of
course
he
grew
to
be
sharp
and
cunning
always
on
the
alert
always
bright
and
ready
skillfully
to
meet
any
approaches
towards
a
discovery
of
his
by
his
employer
who
held
him
in
high
regard
in
this
way
it
went
on
until
james
lewis
was
in
his
twentieth
year
then
the
merchant
received
a
letter
which
aroused
his
suspicions
this
letter
spoke
of
the
young
man
as
not
keeping
the
most
respectable
company
and
as
spending
money
too
freely
for
a
clerk
on
a
moderate
salary
before
this
time
james
and
his
mother
had
removed
into
a
pleasant
house
for
which
he
paid
a
rent
of
four
hundred
dollars
yearly
his
salary
was
only
eight
hundred
dollars
but
he
deceived
his
mother
by
telling
her
that
it
was
fifteen
hundred
every
comfort
that
she
needed
was
fully
supplied
and
she
was
beginning
to
feel
that
after
a
long
struggle
with
the
world
her
happier
days
had
come
james
was
at
his
desk
when
the
letter
was
received
by
carman
he
looked
at
his
employer
and
saw
him
change
countenance
suddenly
the
letter
was
read
twice
and
james
saw
that
the
contents
appeared
to
disturb
his
employer
carman
glanced
toward
the
desk
and
their
eyes
met
it
was
only
for
a
moment
but
the
look
that
james
received
made
his
heart
stop
beating
illustration
look
that
james
received
made
his
heart
stop
there
was
something
about
the
movements
of
the
merchant
for
the
rest
of
the
day
that
troubled
the
young
man
it
was
plain
to
him
that
suspicion
had
been
aroused
by
that
letter
oh
how
bitterly
now
did
he
repent
how
he
dreaded
discovery
and
punishment
exposure
would
disgrace
and
ruin
him
and
bow
the
head
of
his
widowed
mother
even
to
the
grave
that
evening
at
supper
lewis
noticed
that
her
son
did
not
eat
and
that
his
face
was
troubled
you
are
not
well
she
said
perhaps
a
rest
will
make
you
feel
better
it
nothing
but
a
headache
i
lie
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
parlor
a
little
while
lewis
followed
him
into
the
parlor
shortly
and
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
on
which
he
was
lying
placed
her
hand
upon
his
head
ah
it
would
take
more
than
the
loving
pressure
of
a
mother
hand
to
ease
the
pain
which
he
was
suffering
the
touch
of
that
pure
hand
increased
the
pain
to
agony
do
you
feel
better
asked
lewis
she
had
remained
some
time
with
her
hand
on
his
forehead
not
much
he
replied
i
think
a
walk
in
the
open
air
will
do
me
good
he
added
rising
do
go
out
james
said
lewis
a
troubled
feeling
coming
into
her
heart
i
only
walk
a
few
squares
he
replied
as
he
hurried
down
the
street
there
is
something
more
than
headache
the
matter
with
him
thought
lewis
for
half
an
hour
james
walked
without
any
purpose
in
his
mind
beyond
the
escape
from
the
presence
of
his
mother
at
last
his
walk
brought
him
near
carman
store
and
in
passing
he
was
surprised
at
seeing
a
light
within
what
can
this
mean
he
asked
himself
a
new
fear
creeping
into
his
trembling
heart
he
listened
by
the
door
and
windows
but
he
could
hear
no
sound
within
there
something
wrong
he
said
what
can
it
be
if
this
is
discovered
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
ruin
ruin
o
my
poor
mother
the
wretched
young
man
hastened
on
walking
the
streets
for
two
hours
when
he
returned
home
his
mother
met
him
when
he
entered
and
with
unconcealed
anxiety
asked
him
if
he
were
better
he
said
yes
but
in
a
manner
that
only
increased
the
trouble
she
felt
he
then
passed
hastily
to
his
own
room
in
the
morning
the
strangely
altered
face
of
her
son
as
he
met
his
mother
at
the
breakfast
table
struck
alarm
to
her
heart
he
was
silent
and
evaded
all
her
questions
while
they
still
sat
at
the
table
the
door
bell
rang
loudly
the
sound
startled
james
and
he
turned
his
head
nervously
to
listen
who
is
it
asked
lewis
a
gentleman
who
wishes
to
see
james
replied
the
girl
james
rose
instantly
and
went
out
into
the
hall
shutting
the
door
as
he
did
so
lewis
sat
waiting
her
son
return
she
heard
him
coming
back
in
a
few
moments
but
he
did
not
enter
the
then
he
returned
along
the
hall
to
the
street
door
and
she
heard
it
shut
all
was
silent
starting
up
she
ran
into
the
passage
but
james
was
not
there
he
had
gone
away
with
the
person
who
called
ah
that
was
a
sad
home
leaving
carman
had
spent
half
the
night
in
examining
the
accounts
that
had
been
kept
by
james
he
discovered
frauds
of
over
six
thousand
dollars
blindly
indignant
he
had
sent
an
officer
to
arrest
him
early
in
the
morning
it
was
with
this
officer
that
he
went
away
from
his
mother
to
illustration
arrest
of
the
young
villain
shall
lie
in
the
bed
he
has
made
for
himself
exclaimed
carman
in
his
bitter
indignation
and
he
made
a
complete
exposure
at
the
trial
he
showed
an
eager
desire
to
have
him
convicted
and
presented
such
an
array
of
evidence
that
the
jury
could
not
give
any
other
verdict
than
guilty
the
poor
mother
was
in
court
and
sobbed
as
she
heard
the
evidences
of
the
guilt
of
her
son
the
presiding
judge
addressed
the
culprit
and
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
be
pronounced
against
him
the
prisoner
arose
and
said
illustration
went
into
that
man
store
an
innocent
will
it
please
your
honor
to
ask
my
prosecutor
to
come
a
little
nearer
so
that
i
can
look
at
him
and
your
honor
at
the
same
time
carman
was
directed
to
come
forward
james
looked
at
him
a
few
moments
and
turned
to
the
judge
what
i
have
to
say
to
your
honor
is
this
he
spoke
calmly
and
distinctly
and
it
may
in
a
degree
excuse
though
it
can
not
justify
my
crime
i
went
into
that
man
store
an
innocent
boy
if
he
had
been
an
honest
man
i
would
not
stand
before
you
as
a
criminal
carman
appealed
to
the
court
for
protection
against
that
which
he
called
an
outrageous
attack
upon
his
character
but
he
was
ordered
to
be
silent
james
went
on
in
a
firm
voice
only
a
few
weeks
after
i
began
work
in
this
man
store
i
examined
a
bill
by
his
direction
and
discovered
an
error
of
twenty
dollars
the
face
of
carman
was
crimson
you
remember
it
i
see
said
james
and
i
shall
have
cause
to
remember
it
as
long
as
i
live
i
asked
if
i
should
correct
the
figures
and
you
answered
let
them
correct
their
own
mistakes
we
do
examine
bills
for
other
people
benefit
it
was
my
first
lesson
in
dishonesty
i
saw
the
bill
settled
and
carman
took
twenty
dollars
that
was
not
his
own
i
felt
shocked
at
first
it
seemed
such
a
wrong
thing
but
soon
after
this
he
called
me
a
simpleton
for
handing
back
a
bill
to
the
teller
of
a
bank
which
he
had
overpaid
me
on
a
check
and
then
may
i
ask
the
protection
of
the
court
said
carman
is
the
story
of
the
lad
true
asked
the
judge
carman
looked
confused
all
felt
certain
that
he
was
guilty
of
leading
the
unhappy
young
man
astray
not
long
afterward
resumed
the
young
man
in
receiving
my
wages
i
found
that
carman
had
paid
me
fifty
cents
too
much
i
was
about
to
give
it
back
to
him
when
i
remembered
his
remark
about
letting
people
correct
their
own
mistakes
and
i
said
to
myself
him
discover
and
correct
his
own
errors
then
i
dishonestly
kept
the
money
again
the
same
thing
happened
and
again
i
kept
the
money
that
did
not
belong
to
me
this
was
the
beginning
of
evil
and
here
i
am
if
he
had
shown
any
mercy
to
me
i
might
have
kept
silent
and
made
no
defense
the
young
man
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
sat
down
overpowered
with
his
feelings
his
mother
who
was
near
him
sobbed
aloud
and
bending
over
laid
her
hands
on
his
head
my
poor
boy
my
poor
boy
she
murmured
there
were
few
undimmed
eyes
in
the
in
the
silence
that
followed
carman
exclaimed
is
my
character
to
be
thus
blasted
on
the
word
of
a
criminal
your
honor
is
this
right
your
solemn
oath
that
this
charge
is
untrue
said
the
judge
will
clear
your
reputation
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
illustration
him
take
his
oath
if
he
dare
at
these
words
james
lewis
stood
up
again
instantly
it
was
the
unhappy
boy
only
opportunity
and
the
court
felt
bound
in
humanity
to
hear
him
turning
his
eyes
upon
carman
he
exclaimed
let
him
take
his
oath
if
he
dare
carman
consulted
with
his
counsel
and
withdrew
the
judge
then
arose
to
pass
sentence
in
consideration
of
your
youth
and
the
temptation
to
which
in
tender
years
you
were
subjected
the
court
gives
you
the
lightest
sentence
one
year
imprisonment
but
let
me
solemnly
warn
you
against
any
further
steps
in
the
way
you
have
taken
crime
can
have
no
valid
excuse
it
is
evil
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
and
leads
only
to
suffering
when
you
come
forth
again
after
your
imprisonment
may
it
be
with
the
resolution
to
die
rather
than
commit
crime
a
year
afterward
when
james
lewis
came
from
prison
his
mother
was
dead
from
the
day
her
pale
face
faded
from
his
vision
as
he
passed
from
the
he
never
saw
her
again
ten
years
thereafter
a
man
was
reading
a
newspaper
in
a
far
western
town
he
had
a
calm
serious
face
and
looked
like
one
who
had
known
suffering
and
trial
brought
to
justice
at
last
he
said
to
himself
with
deep
emotion
convicted
on
the
charge
of
open
insolvency
and
sent
to
state
prison
so
much
for
the
man
who
gave
me
in
tender
years
the
first
lessons
in
but
thank
god
another
lesson
the
words
of
the
judge
spoken
to
me
so
many
years
ago
have
been
remembered
you
come
forth
again
may
it
be
with
the
resolution
to
die
rather
than
commit
crime
and
i
have
kept
these
words
in
my
heart
when
there
seemed
no
way
of
escaping
except
through
crime
and
god
helping
me
i
will
remember
them
as
long
as
i
live
illustration
your
boy
sick
he
was
not
in
school
a
picture
of
god
it
is
fairly
pathetic
what
a
stranger
god
is
in
his
own
world
he
comes
to
his
own
and
they
who
are
his
own
kinsfolk
keep
him
standing
outside
the
door
while
they
peer
suspiciously
at
him
through
the
crack
at
the
hinges
to
know
god
really
truly
is
the
beginning
of
a
normal
life
one
of
the
best
pictures
of
god
that
i
ever
saw
came
to
me
in
a
simple
story
it
was
of
a
man
a
minister
who
lived
in
a
new
england
town
who
had
a
son
about
fourteen
years
of
age
going
to
school
one
afternoon
the
boy
teacher
called
at
the
home
and
asked
for
the
father
and
said
is
your
boy
sick
no
why
he
was
not
at
school
is
that
so
nor
yesterday
you
do
mean
it
nor
the
day
before
well
and
i
supposed
he
was
sick
no
he
not
sick
well
i
thought
i
should
tell
you
and
the
father
said
thank
you
and
the
teacher
left
and
the
father
sat
thinking
by
and
by
he
heard
a
click
at
the
gate
and
he
knew
the
boy
was
coming
so
he
went
to
open
the
door
and
the
boy
knew
as
he
looked
up
that
his
father
knew
about
those
three
days
and
the
father
said
come
into
the
library
phil
and
phil
went
and
the
door
was
shut
and
the
father
said
phil
your
teacher
was
here
this
afternoon
he
tells
me
you
were
not
at
school
nor
yesterday
nor
the
day
before
and
we
supposed
you
were
you
let
us
think
you
were
and
you
do
not
know
how
badly
i
feel
i
have
always
trusted
you
i
have
always
said
can
trust
my
boy
phil
and
here
you
been
a
living
lie
for
three
whole
days
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
badly
i
feel
about
it
well
that
was
hard
on
phil
to
be
talked
to
quietly
like
that
if
his
father
had
spoken
to
him
roughly
or
had
asked
him
out
to
the
woodshed
for
a
confidential
interview
it
would
not
have
been
nearly
so
hard
then
after
a
moment
pause
the
father
said
phil
we
get
down
and
pray
and
the
thing
was
getting
harder
for
phil
all
the
time
he
did
want
to
pray
just
then
and
they
got
down
and
the
father
poured
out
his
heart
in
prayer
and
the
boy
knew
as
he
listened
how
badly
his
father
felt
over
his
conduct
somehow
he
saw
himself
in
the
mirror
on
his
knees
as
he
had
not
before
it
queer
about
that
mirror
of
the
it
does
show
so
many
things
many
folks
do
like
it
and
they
got
up
and
the
father
eyes
were
wet
and
phil
eyes
were
not
dry
then
the
father
said
my
boy
there
a
law
of
life
that
where
there
is
sin
there
is
suffering
you
ca
detach
those
two
things
where
there
is
suffering
there
has
been
sin
somewhere
and
where
there
is
sin
there
will
be
suffering
you
ca
get
these
two
things
apart
now
he
went
on
you
have
done
wrong
and
i
am
in
this
home
like
god
is
in
the
world
so
we
will
do
this
you
go
up
to
the
attic
i
make
a
pallet
for
you
there
we
take
your
meals
up
to
you
at
the
regular
times
and
you
stay
up
there
as
long
as
you
been
a
living
lie
three
days
and
three
nights
and
phil
did
say
a
word
they
went
up
stairs
the
pallet
was
made
and
the
father
kissed
his
boy
and
left
him
alone
with
his
thoughts
supper
time
came
and
the
father
and
mother
sat
down
to
eat
but
they
could
eat
for
thinking
about
the
boy
the
longer
they
chewed
upon
the
food
the
bigger
and
dryer
it
got
in
their
mouths
and
swallowing
it
was
clear
out
of
the
question
then
they
went
into
the
sitting
room
for
the
evening
he
picked
up
the
evening
paper
to
read
and
she
sat
down
to
sew
well
his
eyes
were
very
good
he
wore
glasses
and
this
evening
he
could
seem
to
see
distinctly
the
glasses
seemed
blurred
it
must
have
been
the
glasses
of
course
so
he
took
them
off
and
cleaned
them
very
deliberately
and
then
found
that
he
had
been
holding
the
paper
upside
down
and
she
tried
to
sew
but
the
thread
broke
and
she
could
seem
to
get
the
needle
threaded
again
you
could
see
they
were
both
bothered
how
we
do
reveal
ourselves
in
the
details
by
and
by
the
clock
struck
nine
and
then
ten
their
usual
hour
for
retiring
but
they
made
no
move
toward
retiring
she
said
are
you
going
to
bed
and
he
said
i
think
i
not
go
yet
a
bit
you
go
no
i
guess
i
wait
a
while
too
and
the
clock
struck
eleven
and
the
hands
worked
around
toward
twelve
then
they
arose
and
locked
up
and
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
each
one
made
pretence
to
be
asleep
and
each
one
knew
the
other
was
not
asleep
by
and
by
she
said
women
are
always
the
keener
why
do
you
sleep
and
he
said
gently
how
did
you
know
i
was
sleeping
why
do
you
sleep
well
i
just
ca
for
thinking
of
the
boy
up
in
the
attic
that
the
bother
with
me
he
replied
and
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
twelve
and
one
and
two
still
no
sleep
came
illustration
going
up
stairs
with
at
last
he
said
mother
i
ca
stand
this
any
longer
i
going
up
stairs
with
phil
and
he
took
his
pillow
and
went
softly
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
attic
stairs
and
pressed
the
softly
so
as
not
to
wake
the
boy
if
he
were
asleep
and
tiptoed
across
the
attic
floor
to
the
corner
by
the
window
and
looked
there
phil
lay
wide
awake
with
something
glistening
in
his
eyes
and
what
looked
like
stains
on
his
cheeks
and
the
father
got
down
in
between
the
sheets
with
his
boy
and
they
got
their
arms
around
each
other
necks
for
they
had
always
been
the
best
of
friends
father
and
boy
and
their
tears
got
mixed
up
on
each
other
cheeks
then
they
slept
and
the
next
night
when
the
time
came
for
sleep
the
father
said
mother
going
up
stairs
with
phil
and
the
second
night
he
slept
in
the
attic
with
his
boy
and
the
third
night
again
he
said
mother
i
going
up
with
the
boy
again
and
the
third
night
he
slept
in
the
place
of
punishment
with
his
son
you
are
not
surprised
to
know
that
that
boy
a
man
grown
is
telling
the
story
of
jesus
with
tongue
and
life
of
flame
in
the
heart
of
china
do
you
know
i
think
that
father
is
the
best
picture
of
god
i
ever
saw
god
could
not
take
away
sin
it
here
he
could
not
take
away
suffering
out
of
kindness
to
man
for
suffering
is
sin
index
finger
saying
there
something
wrong
here
so
he
came
down
in
the
person
of
his
son
and
lay
down
alongside
of
man
for
three
days
and
three
nights
that
god
our
god
and
beyond
that
he
comes
and
puts
his
life
alongside
of
yours
and
mine
and
makes
us
hate
the
bad
and
long
to
be
pure
to
be
on
intimate
terms
with
him
to
live
in
the
atmosphere
of
his
presence
to
spend
the
day
with
him
that
is
the
true
normal
life

jack
and
david
jamison
going
to
mill
if
you
are
only
honest
it
is
not
best
to
try
to
still
the
voice
of
conscience
by
repeating
the
popular
maxim
if
you
are
only
honest
that
is
all
the
mill
was
doing
a
great
business
that
day
when
jack
and
david
jamison
rode
up
with
their
bag
of
corn
to
be
ground
they
lived
on
a
small
farm
five
miles
off
the
main
road
and
were
not
sorry
at
the
prospect
of
waiting
several
hours
for
their
grist
this
would
give
them
a
chance
of
seeing
something
of
the
liveliness
and
bustle
of
the
corner
as
that
part
of
the
village
was
called
where
stood
the
tavern
the
store
and
the
mill
jack
and
david
had
plenty
of
time
and
they
ran
about
a
great
deal
here
and
there
and
saw
and
heard
many
things
at
last
a
heavy
shower
coming
on
they
went
back
to
the
mill
to
eat
their
lunch
and
to
inquire
when
their
turn
would
come
there
they
found
the
miller
son
and
the
son
of
the
squire
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
which
soon
took
jack
attention
the
miller
son
was
urging
upon
the
squire
son
the
importance
of
a
correct
understanding
of
the
bible
but
the
squire
son
only
insisted
that
does
matter
what
a
man
believes
if
he
is
only
jack
was
a
vain
foolish
fellow
and
felt
very
much
pleased
with
the
rattling
speech
of
the
squire
son
and
he
only
wished
that
could
talk
as
well
then
he
would
put
his
old
grandfather
to
confusion
indeed
he
would
is
no
matter
what
a
man
believes
provided
he
is
muttered
jack
bracing
his
conscience
against
the
godly
conversation
of
his
relatives
i
fix
now
he
said
to
himself
with
a
decided
nod
of
the
head
late
in
the
afternoon
the
boys
grist
was
ready
then
the
old
horse
was
brought
out
of
the
shed
the
bag
of
meal
placed
across
her
back
and
jack
and
david
both
mounted
boys
horse
and
bag
all
homeward
bound
you
have
a
longer
ride
ahead
than
i
wish
you
had
boys
said
the
miller
casting
his
eyes
toward
a
dark
cloud
which
was
rising
and
darkening
the
western
sky
there
plenty
of
water
up
there
for
my
mill
but
they
set
off
briskly
and
were
soon
lost
to
sight
among
the
windings
of
the
forest
road
but
the
gloom
gathered
faster
than
the
horse
trotted
so
that
it
was
quite
dark
when
they
reached
a
fork
in
the
road
where
it
might
make
considerable
difference
which
road
they
took
one
was
the
main
road
this
way
there
was
a
good
bridge
over
bounding
brook
a
mountain
stream
which
was
often
dangerously
swollen
by
the
spring
rains
it
was
the
safest
though
the
longest
way
home
the
other
was
a
wood
path
through
the
pines
which
was
the
one
often
taken
by
farmers
living
east
of
the
town
to
shorten
the
distance
to
the
corner
in
this
road
bounding
brook
was
crossed
by
fording
father
told
us
to
be
sure
to
take
the
traveled
road
if
it
was
late
said
david
going
to
asserted
jack
as
he
drew
rein
for
a
moment
at
the
division
of
the
roads
but
really
jack
was
confused
the
windings
of
the
road
with
nothing
but
woods
on
each
side
and
of
course
no
distinct
landmarks
to
direct
them
together
with
the
gloom
of
the
night
and
their
small
acquaintance
with
the
roads
puzzled
the
boys
not
a
little
but
jack
being
the
older
wished
to
impress
his
brother
with
a
sense
of
his
superior
wisdom
and
would
not
admit
his
confusion
quickly
deciding
which
road
he
would
take
he
whipped
up
exclaiming
conclusively
it
all
right
are
you
sure
asked
david
certainly
i
can
not
be
mistaken
i
do
know
said
david
let
me
jump
off
and
run
to
that
light
yonder
there
must
be
a
cabin
there
oh
we
ca
stop
for
all
that
said
jack
i
honestly
believe
this
is
the
traveled
road
david
ca
you
trust
me
but
your
honestly
believing
it
does
make
it
protested
david
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
dave
you
be
still
cried
jack
angrily
i
think
we
ought
to
ask
so
as
to
be
sure
persisted
david
but
jack
whipped
up
and
poor
david
words
went
to
the
winds
as
gust
after
gust
of
the
coming
shower
roared
through
the
forest
and
jack
urged
the
horse
to
all
the
speed
which
her
heavy
load
would
allow
the
lad
was
well
pleased
with
his
hasty
decision
and
the
farther
he
went
the
more
and
more
convinced
was
he
that
it
was
the
right
way
presently
the
roaring
of
bounding
brook
arose
above
the
noise
of
the
tempest
we
shall
be
over
the
bridge
in
a
jiffy
cried
jack
and
then
old
fellow
what
will
you
say
i
like
to
feel
myself
safely
over
muttered
david
when
before
the
other
could
reply
jack
david
horse
and
meal
went
floundering
into
the
raging
waters
of
the
swollen
stream
it
was
pitch
dark
the
storm
was
on
them
and
they
were
miles
from
human
help
the
first
few
moments
of
horrible
suspense
can
scarcely
be
expressed
jack
at
last
found
himself
anchored
on
a
log
of
the
icy
waters
breaking
over
him
and
the
bridle
still
fast
in
his
hand
david
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
david
the
lord
have
mercy
cried
david
i
somewhere
illustration
the
raging
waters
of
the
swollen
the
meal
ah
that
was
making
a
pudding
in
some
wild
eddy
of
the
bounding
brook
far
below
no
matter
what
a
man
believes
provided
he
sincere
cried
poor
jack
thoroughly
drenched
and
humbled
it
the
biggest
lie
the
devil
ever
got
up
it
matter
is
the
main
thing
sincerity
save
a
fellow
from
the
tremendous
consequences
of
being
wrong
it
get
him
out
of
trouble
he
obliged
to
endure
it
no
matter
how
sincere
he
had
been
did
i
honestly
believe
i
was
on
the
right
road
when
i
was
like
going
to
perdition
all
the
time
the
experience
of
that
night
completely
and
forever
cured
poor
jack
of
a
common
error
which
has
brought
many
a
poor
soul
into
the
wild
surges
of
unbelief
and
irreligion
six
things
behind
rufus
said
his
mother
did
you
mail
the
letter
i
gave
you
last
evening
oh
mother
i
forgot
it
i
meant
to
but
just
then
i
had
to
go
and
get
some
new
shoe
strings
so
it
went
out
of
my
mind
did
i
speak
of
those
strings
yesterday
yes
but
just
then
father
called
me
to
ask
if
i
had
weeded
the
pansy
bed
the
night
before
and
had
you
no
mother
i
was
just
writing
the
letter
you
said
must
go
to
grandma
i
thought
you
were
to
write
that
on
saturday
i
meant
to
but
i
had
to
do
some
examples
that
i
did
do
on
friday
so
i
had
time
rufus
called
his
brother
did
you
nail
the
broken
slat
on
the
rabbit
pen
yesterday
oh
rufus
sprang
up
in
dismay
i
was
just
going
to
but
i
watered
the
house
plants
and
i
went
to
do
that
and
then
the
rabbits
are
all
out
rufus
hastened
to
join
in
the
hunt
for
the
pets
in
the
course
of
his
search
he
came
upon
two
tennis
rackets
which
he
had
meant
to
bring
in
the
night
before
and
they
were
in
bad
condition
there
now
it
will
cost
ever
so
much
to
get
these
strung
up
why
i
take
them
in
anyway
i
remember
i
had
locked
the
stable
door
when
father
called
me
and
then
i
hurried
to
do
it
before
he
asked
me
again
later
in
the
day
rufus
with
a
penitent
face
brought
to
his
mother
the
letter
which
should
have
been
mailed
during
the
rabbit
hunt
it
had
slipped
out
of
his
pocket
and
one
of
his
brothers
had
found
it
in
the
damp
clover
it
was
now
a
missive
the
old
brown
hand
the
hand
that
pressed
my
fevered
brow
was
withered
wasted
brown
and
old
its
work
was
almost
over
now
as
swollen
veins
and
wrinkles
told
no
longer
brushing
back
my
hair
it
gently
rested
on
my
wrist
its
touch
seemed
sacred
as
a
prayer
by
the
sweet
breath
of
angels
kissed
i
knew
was
thin
and
brown
and
old
with
many
a
deep
and
honored
seam
wearing
one
little
band
of
gold
the
only
trace
of
youth
bright
dream
and
yet
every
mark
of
care
in
every
wrinkle
mystic
line
i
fancied
jewels
gleaming
there
that
wore
a
beauty
all
divine
another
hand
my
fingers
pressed
was
like
the
lily
dipped
in
snow
yet
still
it
gave
a
wild
unrest
a
weariness
that
none
should
know
there
pearls
with
costly
diamonds
gleamed
and
opals
showed
their
changing
glow
as
moonlight
on
the
ice
has
beamed
or
trembled
on
the
stainless
snow
i
caught
again
the
old
brown
hand
and
smoothed
it
fondly
in
my
own
a
woman
though
so
old
and
tanned
a
woman
brave
and
fearless
grown
aye
it
had
labored
long
and
well
to
dry
the
tear
to
soothe
the
pain
its
own
strong
nerve
to
all
would
tell
that
life
has
work
which
brings
no
shame
we
love
the
pretty
hand
that
rests
in
gentle
fondness
on
our
own
with
nails
like
rosy
calyx
pressed
upon
a
pearly
stainless
cone
but
sacred
is
the
healthful
palm
which
smooths
the
ills
that
round
us
band
the
many
feel
its
sacred
balm
and
holy
seems
the
old
brown
hand
