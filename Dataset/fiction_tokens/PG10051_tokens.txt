i
the
little
pilgrim
in
the
seen
and
unseen
the
little
pilgrim
whose
story
has
been
told
in
another
place
and
who
had
arrived
but
lately
on
the
other
side
among
those
who
know
trouble
and
sorrow
no
more
was
one
whose
heart
was
always
full
of
pity
for
the
suffering
and
after
the
first
rapture
of
her
arrival
and
of
the
blessed
work
which
had
been
given
to
her
to
do
and
all
the
wonderful
things
she
had
learned
of
the
new
life
there
returned
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
so
many
questions
and
longing
thoughts
that
they
were
touched
by
them
who
have
the
care
of
the
younger
brethren
the
simple
ones
of
heaven
these
questions
did
not
disturb
her
peace
or
joy
for
she
knew
that
which
is
so
often
veiled
on
earth
that
all
is
accomplished
by
the
will
of
the
father
and
that
nothing
can
happen
but
according
to
his
appointment
and
under
his
care
and
she
was
also
aware
that
the
end
is
as
the
beginning
to
him
who
knows
all
and
that
nothing
is
lost
that
is
in
his
hand
but
though
she
would
herself
have
willingly
borne
the
sufferings
of
earth
ten
times
over
for
the
sake
of
all
that
was
now
hers
yet
it
pierced
her
soul
to
think
of
those
who
were
struggling
in
darkness
and
whose
hearts
were
stifled
within
them
by
all
the
bitterness
of
the
mortal
life
sometimes
she
would
be
ready
to
cry
out
with
wonder
that
the
lord
did
not
hasten
his
steps
and
go
down
again
upon
the
earth
to
make
all
plain
or
how
the
father
himself
could
restrain
his
power
and
did
not
send
down
ten
legions
of
angels
to
make
all
that
was
wrong
right
and
turn
all
that
was
mournful
into
joy
is
but
for
a
little
time
said
her
companions
we
have
reached
this
place
we
remember
no
more
the
anguish
to
them
in
their
trouble
it
does
not
seem
a
little
time
the
pilgrim
said
and
in
her
heart
there
rose
a
great
longing
oh
that
he
would
send
me
that
i
might
tell
my
brethren
not
like
the
poor
man
in
the
land
of
darkness
of
the
gloom
and
misery
of
that
distant
place
but
a
happier
message
of
the
light
and
brightness
of
this
and
how
soon
all
pain
would
be
over
she
would
not
put
this
into
a
prayer
for
she
knew
that
to
refuse
a
prayer
is
pain
to
the
father
if
in
his
great
glory
any
pain
can
be
and
then
she
reasoned
with
herself
and
said
can
i
tell
them
except
that
all
will
soon
be
well
and
this
they
know
for
our
lord
has
said
it
but
i
am
like
them
and
i
do
not
understand
one
fair
morning
while
she
turned
over
these
thoughts
in
her
mind
there
suddenly
came
towards
her
one
whom
she
knew
as
a
sage
of
the
number
of
those
who
know
many
mysteries
and
search
into
the
deep
things
of
the
father
for
a
moment
she
wondered
if
perhaps
he
came
to
reprove
her
for
too
many
questionings
and
rose
up
and
advanced
a
little
towards
him
with
folded
hands
and
a
thankful
heart
to
receive
the
reproof
if
it
should
be
so
for
whether
it
were
praise
or
whether
it
were
blame
it
was
from
the
father
and
a
great
honor
and
happiness
to
receive
but
as
he
came
towards
her
he
smiled
and
bade
her
not
to
fear
am
come
he
said
tell
you
some
things
you
long
to
know
and
to
show
you
some
things
that
are
hidden
to
most
little
sister
you
are
not
to
be
charged
with
any
mission
no
she
said
no
i
was
not
so
presuming
is
not
presuming
to
wish
to
carry
comfort
to
any
soul
but
it
is
permitted
to
me
to
open
up
to
you
so
far
as
i
may
some
of
the
secrets
the
secrets
of
the
father
are
all
beautiful
but
there
is
sorrow
in
them
as
well
as
joy
and
pain
you
know
is
one
of
the
great
angels
at
the
door
his
name
pain
and
i
took
him
for
consolation
the
little
pilgrim
said
is
not
consolation
he
is
the
schoolmaster
whose
face
is
often
stern
but
i
did
not
come
to
tell
you
of
him
whom
you
know
i
am
going
to
take
you
back
the
wise
man
said
she
knew
what
this
meant
and
a
great
pleasure
yet
mingled
with
fear
came
into
her
mind
she
hesitated
and
looked
at
him
and
did
not
know
how
to
accept
though
she
longed
to
do
so
for
at
the
same
time
she
was
afraid
he
smiled
when
he
saw
the
alarm
in
her
face
you
think
he
said
you
are
to
go
this
journey
on
your
own
charges
had
you
insisted
as
some
do
to
go
at
all
hazards
you
might
indeed
have
feared
and
even
now
i
can
not
promise
that
you
will
not
feel
the
thorns
of
the
earth
as
you
pass
but
you
will
be
cared
for
so
that
no
harm
can
come
she
said
wistfully
is
not
for
harm
and
could
say
nothing
more
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
and
he
said
not
fear
though
they
see
you
not
it
is
yet
sweet
for
a
moment
to
be
there
and
as
you
pass
it
brings
thoughts
of
you
to
their
minds
for
these
two
understood
each
other
and
knew
that
to
see
and
yet
not
be
seen
is
only
a
pleasure
for
those
who
are
most
like
the
father
and
can
love
without
thought
of
love
in
return
when
he
touched
her
it
seemed
to
the
little
pilgrim
suddenly
that
everything
changed
round
her
and
that
she
was
no
longer
in
her
own
place
but
walking
along
a
weary
length
of
road
it
was
narrow
and
rough
and
the
skies
were
dim
and
as
she
went
on
by
the
side
of
her
guide
she
saw
houses
and
gardens
which
were
to
her
like
the
houses
that
children
build
and
the
little
gardens
in
which
they
sow
seeds
and
plant
flowers
and
take
them
up
again
to
see
if
they
are
growing
she
turned
to
the
sage
saying
are
and
then
stopped
and
gazed
again
and
burst
out
into
something
that
was
between
laughing
and
tears
it
is
home
she
cried
i
did
not
know
it
dear
home
her
heart
was
remorseful
as
if
she
had
wounded
the
little
diminished
place
is
what
happens
with
those
who
have
been
living
in
the
palaces
he
said
with
a
smile
i
love
it
dearly
i
love
it
dearly
the
little
pilgrim
said
stretching
out
her
hands
as
if
for
pardon
he
smiled
at
her
consoling
her
and
then
his
face
changed
and
grew
very
grave
sister
he
said
have
come
not
to
see
happiness
but
pain
we
want
no
explanation
of
the
joy
for
that
flows
freely
from
the
heart
of
the
father
and
all
is
clear
between
us
and
him
but
that
which
you
desire
to
know
is
why
trouble
should
be
therefore
you
must
think
of
him
and
be
strong
for
here
is
what
will
rend
your
heart
the
little
pilgrim
was
seized
once
more
with
mortal
fear
friend
she
cried
have
done
with
pain
must
i
go
and
see
others
suffering
and
do
nothing
for
them
anything
comes
into
your
heart
to
do
or
say
it
will
be
well
for
them
the
sage
replied
and
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
a
house
she
knew
she
began
to
know
them
all
now
as
her
vision
became
accustomed
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
she
perceived
that
the
sun
was
shining
though
it
had
appeared
so
dim
and
that
it
was
a
clear
summer
morning
very
early
with
still
the
colors
of
the
dawn
in
the
east
when
she
went
indoors
at
first
she
saw
nothing
for
the
room
was
darkened
the
windows
all
closed
and
a
miserable
only
burning
in
the
bed
there
lay
a
child
whom
she
knew
she
knew
them
all
the
mother
at
the
bedside
the
father
near
the
door
even
the
nurse
who
was
flitting
about
disturbing
the
silence
her
heart
gave
a
great
throb
when
she
recognized
them
all
and
though
she
had
been
glad
for
the
first
moment
to
think
that
she
had
come
just
in
time
to
give
welcome
to
a
little
brother
stepping
out
of
earth
into
the
better
country
a
shadow
of
trouble
and
pain
enveloped
her
when
she
saw
the
others
and
remembered
and
knew
for
he
was
their
beloved
child
on
all
the
earth
there
was
nothing
they
held
so
dear
they
would
have
given
up
their
home
and
all
they
possessed
and
become
poor
and
homeless
and
wanderers
with
joy
if
god
as
they
said
would
have
but
spared
their
child
she
saw
into
their
hearts
and
read
all
this
there
and
knowing
them
she
knew
it
without
even
that
insight
everything
they
would
have
given
up
and
rejoiced
if
but
they
might
have
kept
him
and
there
he
lay
and
was
about
to
die
the
little
pilgrim
forgot
all
but
the
pity
of
it
and
their
hearts
that
were
breaking
and
the
vacant
place
that
was
soon
to
be
she
cried
out
aloud
upon
the
father
with
a
great
cry
she
forgot
that
it
was
a
grief
to
him
in
his
great
glory
to
refuse
there
came
no
reply
but
the
room
grew
light
as
with
a
reflection
out
of
heaven
and
the
child
in
the
bed
who
had
been
moving
restlessly
in
the
weariness
of
ending
life
turned
his
head
towards
her
and
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
he
saw
her
where
she
stood
he
cried
out
mother
mother
the
mother
who
was
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
lifted
her
head
and
cried
is
it
what
is
it
o
my
darling
and
the
father
who
had
turned
away
his
face
not
to
see
the
child
die
came
nearer
to
the
bed
hoping
they
knew
not
what
their
faces
were
paler
than
the
face
of
the
dying
upon
which
there
was
light
but
no
light
came
to
them
out
of
the
hidden
heaven
she
has
come
for
me
he
said
but
his
voice
was
so
weak
they
could
not
hear
him
nor
take
any
comfort
at
this
the
little
pilgrim
put
out
her
arms
to
him
forgetting
in
her
joy
the
poor
people
who
were
mourning
and
cried
out
but
i
must
go
with
him
i
must
take
him
home
for
this
was
her
own
work
and
she
thought
of
her
wonderings
and
her
questions
no
more
some
one
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
and
she
looked
round
and
behind
her
was
a
great
company
of
the
dear
children
from
the
better
country
whom
the
father
had
sent
and
not
her
lest
he
should
grieve
for
those
he
had
left
behind
to
come
for
the
child
and
show
him
the
way
she
paused
for
a
moment
scarcely
willing
to
give
him
up
but
then
her
companion
touched
her
and
pointed
to
the
other
side
ah
that
was
different
the
mother
lay
by
the
side
of
the
bed
her
face
turned
only
to
the
little
white
body
which
her
child
had
dropped
from
him
as
he
came
out
of
his
sickness
her
eyes
wild
with
misery
without
tears
her
feverish
mouth
open
but
no
cry
in
it
the
sword
of
the
angel
had
gone
through
and
through
her
she
did
not
even
writhe
upon
it
but
lay
motionless
cut
down
dumb
with
anguish
the
father
had
turned
round
again
and
leaned
his
head
upon
the
wall
all
was
over
all
over
the
love
and
the
hope
of
a
dozen
lovely
years
the
little
sweet
companion
the
daily
joy
the
future
trust
all
over
as
if
a
child
had
never
been
born
then
there
rose
in
the
stillness
a
great
and
exceeding
bitter
cry
that
was
all
pealing
up
to
heaven
to
the
father
whom
they
could
not
see
in
their
anguish
accusing
him
reproaching
him
who
had
done
it
was
he
their
enemy
that
he
had
done
it
no
man
was
ever
so
wicked
ever
so
cruel
but
he
would
have
spared
them
their
boy
taken
everything
and
spared
them
their
boy
but
god
god
the
little
pilgrim
stood
by
and
wept
she
could
do
nothing
but
weep
weep
her
heart
aching
with
the
pity
and
the
anguish
how
were
they
to
be
told
that
it
was
not
god
but
the
father
that
god
was
only
his
common
name
his
name
in
law
and
that
he
was
the
father
this
was
all
she
could
think
of
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
and
the
boy
had
shaken
his
little
bright
soul
out
of
the
sickness
and
the
weakness
with
such
a
look
of
delight
he
knew
in
a
moment
but
they
oh
when
when
would
they
know
presently
she
sat
outside
in
the
soft
breathing
airs
and
little
morning
breezes
and
dried
her
aching
eyes
and
the
sage
who
was
her
companion
soothed
her
with
kind
words
said
you
would
feel
the
thorns
as
you
passed
he
said
can
not
be
free
of
them
we
who
are
of
mankind
oh
she
cried
amid
her
tears
why
the
air
of
the
earth
is
in
my
eyes
i
can
not
see
oh
what
pain
it
is
what
misery
was
it
because
they
loved
him
too
much
and
that
he
drew
their
hearts
away
the
sage
only
shook
his
head
at
her
smiling
one
love
too
much
he
said
brother
it
is
very
hard
to
live
and
to
see
another
i
am
confused
in
my
mind
said
the
little
pilgrim
putting
her
hand
to
her
eyes
tears
of
those
that
weep
have
got
into
my
soul
to
live
and
see
another
die
that
was
what
i
was
saying
but
the
child
lives
like
you
and
me
tell
me
for
i
am
confused
in
my
mind
said
the
sage
and
when
she
listened
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
children
going
back
with
a
great
murmur
and
ringing
of
pleasant
voices
like
silver
bells
in
the
air
and
among
them
the
voice
of
the
child
asking
a
thousand
questions
calling
them
by
their
names
the
two
pilgrims
listened
and
laughed
to
each
other
for
love
at
the
sound
of
the
children
it
for
the
little
brother
that
you
are
troubled
the
sage
said
in
her
ear
then
she
was
ashamed
and
turned
from
the
joyful
sounds
that
were
ascending
ever
higher
and
higher
to
the
little
house
that
stood
below
with
all
its
windows
closed
upon
the
light
it
was
wrapped
in
darkness
though
the
sun
was
shining
the
windows
closed
as
if
they
never
would
open
more
and
the
people
within
turning
their
faces
to
the
wall
covering
their
eyes
that
they
might
not
see
the
light
of
day
miserable
day
they
were
saying
dark
hour
o
life
that
will
never
smile
again
she
sat
between
earth
and
heaven
her
eyes
smiling
but
her
mouth
beginning
to
quiver
once
more
it
to
raise
their
thoughts
and
their
hearts
she
said
sister
said
he
the
father
speaks
to
you
it
is
not
for
me
nor
for
another
that
he
speaks
and
what
he
says
to
you
is
said
the
little
pilgrim
with
joy
is
for
myself
myself
alone
as
if
i
were
a
great
angel
as
if
i
were
a
saint
it
drops
into
my
heart
like
the
dew
it
is
what
i
need
not
for
you
though
i
love
you
but
for
me
only
it
is
my
secret
between
me
and
him
her
companion
bowed
his
head
is
so
and
thus
has
he
spoken
to
the
little
child
but
what
he
said
or
why
he
said
it
is
not
for
you
or
me
to
know
it
is
his
secret
it
is
between
the
little
one
and
his
father
who
can
interfere
between
these
two
many
and
many
are
there
born
on
earth
whose
work
and
whose
life
are
ordained
elsewhere
for
there
is
no
way
of
entrance
into
the
race
of
man
which
is
the
nature
of
the
lord
but
by
the
gates
of
birth
and
the
work
which
the
father
has
to
do
is
so
great
and
manifold
that
there
are
multitudes
who
do
but
pass
through
those
gates
to
ascend
to
their
work
elsewhere
but
the
father
alone
knows
whom
he
has
chosen
it
is
between
the
child
and
him
it
is
their
secret
it
is
as
you
have
said
the
little
pilgrim
was
silent
for
a
moment
but
then
turned
her
head
from
the
bright
shining
of
the
skies
and
the
voices
of
the
children
which
floated
farther
and
farther
off
and
looked
at
the
house
in
which
there
was
sorrow
and
despair
she
pointed
towards
it
and
looked
at
him
who
was
her
instructor
and
had
come
to
show
her
how
these
things
were
are
to
blame
he
said
none
will
blame
them
the
little
life
is
hard
the
father
though
he
is
very
near
seems
far
off
and
sometimes
even
his
word
is
as
a
dream
it
is
to
them
as
if
they
had
lost
their
child
can
you
not
remember
that
was
what
we
said
we
have
lost
then
the
little
pilgrim
musing
began
to
smile
but
wept
again
as
she
thought
of
the
father
and
the
mother
we
were
to
go
she
said
in
hand
you
and
i
and
tell
them
that
the
father
had
need
of
him
that
it
was
not
for
the
little
life
but
for
the
great
and
beautiful
world
above
that
the
child
was
born
and
that
he
had
got
great
promotion
and
was
gone
with
the
princes
and
the
angels
according
as
was
ordained
and
why
should
they
mourn
let
us
go
and
tell
them
he
shook
his
head
could
not
see
us
they
would
not
know
us
we
should
be
to
them
as
dreams
if
they
do
not
take
comfort
from
our
lord
how
could
they
take
comfort
from
you
and
me
we
could
not
bring
them
back
their
child
they
want
their
child
not
only
to
know
that
all
is
well
with
him
for
they
know
that
all
is
well
with
him
but
what
they
want
is
their
child
they
are
to
blame
but
who
shall
blame
them
not
any
one
that
is
born
of
woman
how
can
we
tell
them
what
is
the
father
secret
and
the
child
yet
we
could
tell
them
why
it
must
be
so
said
the
little
pilgrim
they
prayed
and
besought
the
lord
o
brother
i
have
no
understanding
for
the
lord
said
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
and
they
asked
yet
they
are
refused
sister
the
father
must
judge
between
his
children
and
he
must
first
be
heard
who
is
most
concerned
while
they
were
praying
the
father
and
the
child
talked
together
and
said
what
we
know
not
but
this
we
know
that
his
heart
was
satisfied
with
that
which
was
said
to
him
must
not
the
father
do
what
is
best
for
the
child
he
loves
whatever
the
other
children
may
say
nay
did
not
our
own
fathers
do
this
on
earth
and
we
submitted
to
them
how
much
more
he
who
sees
all
the
little
pilgrim
stole
softly
from
his
side
when
he
had
done
speaking
and
went
back
into
the
darkened
house
and
saw
the
mother
where
she
sat
weeping
and
refusing
to
be
comforted
in
her
sorrow
perceiving
not
heaven
nor
any
consolation
nor
understanding
that
her
child
had
gone
joyfully
to
his
father
and
her
father
as
his
soul
had
required
and
as
the
lord
had
willed
yet
though
she
had
not
joy
but
only
anguish
in
her
faith
and
though
her
eyes
were
darkened
that
she
could
not
see
yet
the
woman
ceased
not
to
call
upon
god
god
and
to
hold
by
him
who
had
smitten
her
and
the
father
of
the
child
had
gone
into
his
chamber
and
shut
the
door
and
sat
dumb
opening
not
his
mouth
thinking
upon
his
delightsome
boy
and
how
they
had
walked
together
and
talked
together
and
should
do
so
again
nevermore
and
in
their
hearts
they
reproached
their
god
the
giver
of
all
and
accused
the
lord
to
his
face
as
if
he
had
deceived
them
yet
clung
to
him
still
weeping
and
upbraiding
and
would
not
let
him
go
the
little
pilgrim
wept
too
and
said
many
things
to
them
which
they
could
not
hear
but
when
she
saw
that
though
they
were
in
darkness
and
misery
god
was
in
all
their
thoughts
she
bethought
herself
suddenly
of
what
the
poet
had
said
in
the
celestial
city
and
of
the
songs
he
sang
which
were
a
wonder
to
the
angels
and
powers
of
the
little
life
and
the
sorrowful
earth
where
men
endured
all
things
yet
overcame
by
the
name
of
the
lord
when
this
came
into
her
mind
she
rose
up
again
softly
with
a
sacred
awe
and
wept
not
but
did
them
reverence
for
without
any
light
or
guidance
in
their
anguish
they
yet
wavered
not
died
not
but
endured
and
in
the
end
would
overcome
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
saw
the
great
beautiful
angels
looking
on
the
great
souls
that
are
called
to
love
and
to
serve
but
not
to
suffer
like
the
little
brethren
of
the
earth
and
that
among
the
princes
of
heaven
there
was
reverence
and
awe
and
even
envy
of
those
who
thus
had
their
garments
bathed
in
blood
and
suffered
loss
and
pain
and
misery
yet
never
abandoned
their
life
and
the
work
that
had
been
given
them
to
do
as
she
came
forth
again
comforted
she
found
the
sage
standing
with
his
face
lifted
to
heaven
smiling
still
at
the
sound
though
faint
and
distant
of
the
children
all
calling
to
each
other
and
shouting
together
as
they
reached
the
gate
hush
she
said
not
the
mother
hear
them
for
it
will
make
her
heart
more
bitter
to
think
she
can
never
hear
again
her
child
voice
it
is
her
child
voice
he
said
then
very
gently
are
to
blame
but
no
one
will
be
found
to
blame
them
either
in
earth
or
heaven
the
earth
pilgrims
went
far
after
this
yet
more
softly
than
when
they
first
left
their
beautiful
country
for
then
the
little
pilgrim
had
been
glad
believing
that
as
all
had
been
made
clear
to
her
in
her
own
life
so
that
all
that
concerned
the
life
of
man
should
be
made
clear
but
this
was
more
hard
and
encompassed
with
pain
and
darkness
as
that
which
is
in
the
doing
is
always
more
hard
to
understand
than
that
which
is
accomplished
and
she
learned
now
what
she
had
not
understood
though
her
companion
warned
her
how
sharp
are
those
thorns
of
earth
that
pierce
the
wayfarer
foot
and
that
those
who
come
back
can
not
help
but
suffer
because
of
love
and
and
she
learned
that
though
she
could
smile
and
give
thanks
to
the
father
in
the
recollection
of
her
own
griefs
that
were
past
yet
those
that
are
present
are
too
poignant
and
to
look
upon
others
in
their
hour
of
darkness
makes
his
ways
more
hard
to
comprehend
than
even
when
the
sorrow
is
your
own
while
she
mused
thus
there
was
suddenly
revealed
to
her
another
sight
they
had
gone
far
before
they
came
to
this
new
scene
night
had
crept
over
the
skies
all
gray
and
dark
and
the
sea
came
in
with
a
whisper
which
sounded
to
some
like
the
hush
of
peace
and
to
some
like
the
voice
of
sorrow
and
moaning
and
to
some
was
but
the
monotony
of
endless
recurrence
in
which
was
no
soul
the
skies
were
dark
overhead
but
opened
with
a
clear
shining
of
light
which
had
no
color
towards
the
west
for
the
sun
had
long
gone
down
and
it
was
night
the
two
travellers
perceived
a
woman
who
came
out
of
a
house
all
lit
with
lamps
and
firelight
and
took
the
lonely
path
towards
the
sea
and
the
little
pilgrim
knew
her
as
she
had
known
the
father
and
mother
in
the
darkened
house
and
would
have
joined
her
with
a
cry
of
pleasure
but
she
remembered
that
the
friend
could
not
see
her
or
hear
her
being
wrapped
still
in
the
mortal
body
and
in
a
close
enveloping
mantle
of
thoughts
and
cares
the
sage
made
her
a
sign
to
follow
and
these
two
tender
companions
accompanied
her
who
saw
them
not
walking
darkling
by
the
silent
way
the
heart
of
the
woman
was
heavy
in
her
breast
it
was
so
sore
by
reason
of
trouble
and
for
all
the
bitter
wounds
of
the
past
and
all
the
fears
that
beset
her
life
to
come
that
she
walked
not
weeping
because
of
being
beyond
tears
but
as
it
were
bleeding
her
thoughts
being
in
her
little
way
like
those
of
his
upon
whose
brow
there
once
stood
drops
as
it
were
of
blood
and
out
of
her
heart
there
came
a
moaning
which
was
without
words
if
words
had
been
possible
they
would
have
been
as
his
also
who
said
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
for
those
who
had
wounded
her
were
those
whom
in
all
the
world
she
loved
most
dear
and
the
quivering
of
anguish
was
in
her
as
she
walked
seeking
the
darkness
and
the
silence
and
to
hide
herself
if
that
might
be
from
her
own
thoughts
she
went
along
the
lonely
path
with
the
stinging
of
her
wounds
so
keen
and
sharp
that
all
her
body
and
soul
were
as
one
pain
greater
grief
hath
no
man
than
this
to
be
slain
and
tortured
by
those
whom
he
loves
when
her
soul
could
speak
this
was
what
it
said
forgive
them
father
save
them
she
had
no
strength
for
more
this
the
heavenly
pilgrims
saw
for
they
stood
by
her
as
in
their
own
country
where
every
thought
is
clear
and
saw
her
heart
but
as
they
followed
her
and
looked
into
her
soul
with
their
hearts
which
were
human
too
wrung
at
the
sight
of
hers
in
its
anguish
there
suddenly
became
visible
before
them
a
strange
sight
such
as
they
had
never
seen
before
it
was
like
the
rising
of
the
sun
but
it
was
not
the
sun
suddenly
into
the
heart
upon
which
they
looked
there
came
a
great
silence
and
calm
there
was
nothing
said
that
even
they
could
hear
nor
done
that
they
could
see
but
for
a
moment
the
throbbing
was
stilled
and
the
anguish
calmed
and
there
came
a
great
peace
the
woman
in
whom
this
wonder
was
wrought
was
astonished
as
they
were
she
gave
a
low
cry
in
the
darkness
for
wonder
that
the
pain
had
gone
from
her
in
an
instant
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
there
was
no
promise
made
to
her
that
her
prayer
would
be
granted
and
no
new
light
given
to
guide
her
for
the
time
to
come
but
her
pain
was
taken
away
she
stood
hushed
and
lifted
her
eyes
and
the
gray
of
the
sea
and
the
low
cloud
that
was
like
a
canopy
above
and
the
lightening
of
colorless
light
towards
the
west
entered
with
their
great
quiet
into
her
heart
this
the
peace
that
passeth
all
understanding
she
said
to
herself
confused
with
the
sudden
calm
in
all
her
life
it
had
never
so
happened
to
her
before
to
be
healed
of
her
grievous
wounds
yet
without
cause
and
while
no
change
was
wrought
yet
to
be
put
to
rest
is
our
brother
said
the
little
pilgrim
shedding
tears
of
joy
is
the
secret
of
the
lord
said
the
sage
but
not
even
they
had
seen
him
passing
by
they
walked
with
her
softly
in
the
silence
in
the
sound
of
the
sea
till
the
wonder
in
her
was
hushed
like
the
pain
and
talked
with
her
though
she
knew
it
not
for
very
soon
questions
arose
in
her
heart
oh
she
said
this
the
lord
reply
with
thankfulness
and
awe
but
because
she
was
human
and
knew
so
little
and
was
full
of
impatience
and
is
this
was
what
she
next
said
asked
for
and
thou
hast
given
to
then
the
voice
of
her
heart
grew
louder
and
she
cried
with
the
sound
of
the
pain
coming
back
ask
one
thing
and
thou
givest
another
i
asked
no
blessing
for
me
i
asked
for
them
my
lord
my
god
give
it
to
them
to
them
with
disappointment
rising
in
her
heart
the
little
pilgrim
laid
her
hand
upon
the
woman
arm
for
she
was
afraid
lest
our
lord
might
be
displeased
forgetting
for
she
was
still
imperfect
that
he
sees
all
that
is
in
the
soul
and
understands
and
takes
no
offence
and
said
quickly
be
not
afraid
he
will
save
them
too
the
blessing
will
come
for
them
too
his
own
time
said
the
sage
in
his
own
way
these
thoughts
rose
in
the
woman
soul
she
did
not
know
that
they
were
said
to
her
nor
who
said
them
but
accepted
them
as
if
they
had
come
from
her
own
thoughts
for
she
said
to
herself
is
what
is
meant
by
the
answer
of
prayer
it
is
not
what
we
ask
yet
what
i
ask
is
according
to
thy
will
my
lord
it
is
not
riches
nor
honors
nor
beauty
nor
health
nor
long
life
nor
anything
of
this
world
if
i
have
been
impatient
this
is
my
punishment
that
the
lord
has
thought
not
of
them
but
of
me
but
i
can
bear
all
o
my
lord
that
and
a
thousand
times
more
if
thou
wilt
but
think
of
them
and
not
of
me
nevertheless
she
returned
to
her
home
stilled
and
comforted
for
though
her
trouble
returned
to
her
and
was
not
changed
yet
for
a
moment
it
had
been
lifted
from
her
and
the
peace
which
passeth
all
understanding
had
entered
her
heart
why
then
said
the
little
pilgrim
to
her
companion
when
the
friend
was
gone
will
not
the
father
give
to
her
what
she
asks
for
i
know
what
it
is
it
is
that
those
whom
she
loves
should
love
him
and
serve
him
and
that
is
his
will
too
for
he
would
have
all
love
him
he
who
loves
all
sister
said
her
companion
asked
me
why
he
did
not
let
the
child
remain
upon
the
earth
but
that
is
different
she
cried
it
is
different
when
you
said
that
the
secret
was
between
the
child
and
the
father
i
knew
that
it
was
so
for
it
is
just
that
the
father
should
consider
us
first
one
by
one
and
do
for
us
what
is
best
but
it
is
always
best
to
serve
him
it
is
best
to
love
him
it
is
best
to
give
up
all
the
world
and
cleave
to
him
and
follow
wherever
he
goes
no
man
can
say
otherwise
than
this
that
to
follow
the
lord
and
serve
him
that
is
well
for
all
and
always
the
best
she
spoke
so
hotly
and
hastily
that
her
companion
could
find
no
room
for
reply
but
he
was
in
no
haste
he
waited
till
she
had
said
what
was
in
her
heart
then
he
replied
it
were
even
so
if
the
father
heard
all
prayers
and
put
forth
his
hand
and
forced
those
who
were
far
off
to
come
near
the
little
pilgrim
looked
up
with
horror
in
her
face
as
if
he
had
blasphemed
and
said
not
so
not
so
it
must
be
so
he
said
it
is
against
their
desire
and
will
not
so
not
so
she
cried
that
he
should
change
their
hearts
that
too
against
their
will
he
said
the
little
pilgrim
paused
upon
the
way
and
her
heart
rose
against
her
companion
who
spoke
things
so
hard
to
be
received
and
that
seemed
to
dishonor
the
work
of
the
lord
but
she
remembered
that
it
could
not
be
so
and
paused
before
she
spoke
and
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
wonder
and
almost
of
fear
must
they
perish
she
said
must
her
heart
break
and
her
voice
sank
low
for
pity
and
sorrow
though
she
was
herself
among
the
blessed
yet
the
thorns
and
briers
of
the
earth
caught
at
her
garments
and
pierced
her
tender
feet
sister
said
the
sage
us
who
are
born
of
the
earth
it
is
hard
to
remember
that
the
child
belongs
not
first
to
the
parents
nor
the
husband
to
the
wife
nor
the
wife
to
the
husband
but
that
all
are
the
children
of
the
father
and
he
is
just
he
will
not
neglect
the
little
one
because
of
those
prayers
which
the
father
and
the
mother
pour
forth
to
him
although
they
cry
with
anguish
and
with
tears
nor
will
he
break
his
great
law
and
violate
the
nature
he
has
made
and
compel
his
own
child
to
what
it
wills
not
and
loves
not
the
woman
is
comforted
in
the
breaking
of
her
heart
but
those
whom
she
loves
are
not
they
also
the
children
of
the
father
who
loves
them
more
than
she
does
and
each
is
to
him
as
if
there
were
not
another
in
the
world
nor
is
there
any
other
in
the
world
for
none
can
come
between
the
father
and
the
child
a
smile
came
upon
the
little
pilgrim
face
yet
she
trembled
is
dim
before
me
she
said
i
can
not
see
clearly
oh
if
the
time
would
but
hasten
that
our
lord
might
come
and
all
struggles
be
ended
and
the
darkness
vanish
away
will
come
when
all
things
are
ready
said
the
sage
and
as
they
went
upon
their
way
be
showed
her
other
sights
and
the
mysteries
of
the
heart
of
man
and
the
great
patience
of
our
lord
it
happened
to
them
suddenly
to
perceive
in
their
way
a
man
returning
home
these
are
words
that
are
sweet
to
all
who
have
lived
upon
the
earth
and
known
its
ways
but
far
far
were
they
from
that
meaning
which
is
sweet
the
dark
hours
had
passed
and
men
had
slept
and
the
night
was
over
the
sun
was
rising
in
the
sky
which
was
keen
and
clear
with
the
pleasure
of
the
morning
the
air
was
fresh
with
the
dew
and
the
birds
awaking
in
the
trees
and
the
breeze
so
sweet
that
it
seemed
to
blow
from
heaven
and
to
the
two
travellers
it
seemed
almost
in
the
joy
of
the
new
day
as
if
the
lord
had
already
come
but
here
was
one
who
proved
that
it
was
not
so
he
had
not
slept
all
the
night
nor
had
night
been
silent
to
him
nor
dark
but
full
of
glaring
light
and
noise
and
riot
his
eyes
were
red
with
fever
and
weariness
and
his
soul
was
sick
within
him
and
the
morning
looked
him
in
the
face
and
upbraided
him
as
a
sister
might
have
upbraided
him
who
loved
him
and
he
said
in
his
heart
as
one
had
said
of
old
that
all
was
vanity
that
it
was
vain
to
live
and
evil
to
have
been
born
that
the
day
of
death
was
better
than
the
day
of
birth
and
all
was
delusion
and
love
but
a
word
and
life
a
lie
his
footsteps
on
the
road
seemed
to
sound
all
through
the
sleeping
world
and
when
he
looked
the
morning
in
the
face
he
was
ashamed
and
cursed
the
light
the
two
went
after
him
into
a
silent
house
where
everybody
slept
the
light
that
had
burned
for
him
all
night
was
sick
like
a
guilty
thing
in
the
eye
of
day
and
all
that
had
been
prepared
for
his
repose
was
ghastly
to
him
in
the
hour
of
awaking
as
if
prepared
not
for
sleep
but
for
death
his
heart
was
sick
like
the
and
life
flickered
within
him
with
disgust
and
disappointment
for
why
had
he
been
born
if
this
were
all
for
all
was
vanity
the
night
and
the
day
had
been
passed
in
pleasure
and
it
was
vanity
and
now
his
soul
loathed
his
pleasures
yet
he
knew
that
was
vanity
too
and
that
next
day
he
would
resume
them
as
before
all
was
vain
the
morning
and
the
evening
and
the
spirit
of
man
and
the
ways
of
human
life
he
looked
himself
in
the
face
and
loathed
this
dream
of
existence
and
knew
that
it
was
naught
so
much
as
it
had
cost
to
be
born
to
be
fed
and
guarded
and
taught
and
cared
for
and
all
for
this
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
better
to
die
than
to
live
and
never
to
have
been
than
to
be
as
these
spectators
stood
by
with
much
pity
and
tenderness
looking
into
the
weariness
and
sickness
of
this
soul
there
began
to
be
enacted
before
them
a
scene
such
as
no
man
could
have
seen
which
no
one
was
aware
of
save
he
who
was
concerned
and
which
even
to
him
was
not
clear
in
its
meanings
but
rather
like
a
phantasmagoria
a
thing
of
the
mists
yet
which
was
great
and
solemn
as
is
the
council
of
a
king
in
which
great
things
are
debated
for
the
welfare
of
the
nations
the
air
seemed
in
a
moment
to
be
full
of
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
of
something
more
subtle
which
the
sage
and
the
pilgrim
knew
to
be
wings
and
as
they
looked
there
grew
before
them
the
semblance
of
a
court
of
justice
with
accusers
and
defenders
but
the
judge
and
the
criminal
were
one
then
was
put
forth
that
indictment
which
he
had
been
making
up
in
his
soul
against
life
and
against
the
world
and
again
another
indictment
which
was
against
himself
and
then
the
advocates
began
their
pleadings
voices
were
there
great
and
eloquent
such
as
are
familiar
in
the
courts
above
which
sounded
forth
in
the
spectators
ears
earnest
as
those
who
plead
for
life
and
death
and
these
speakers
declared
that
sin
only
is
vanity
that
life
is
noble
and
love
sweet
and
every
man
made
in
the
image
of
god
to
serve
both
god
and
man
and
they
set
forth
their
reasons
before
the
judge
and
showed
him
mysteries
of
life
and
death
and
they
took
up
the
and
proved
to
him
how
in
all
the
world
he
had
sought
but
himself
his
own
pleasure
and
profit
his
own
will
not
the
will
of
god
nor
even
the
good
desire
of
humble
nature
but
only
that
which
pleased
his
sick
fancies
and
his
heart
and
they
besought
him
with
a
thousand
arguments
to
return
and
choose
again
the
better
way
they
cried
miserable
and
become
great
arise
thou
vain
soul
and
become
noble
take
thy
birthright
o
son
and
behold
the
face
of
the
father
and
then
there
came
a
whispering
of
lower
voices
very
penetrating
and
sweet
like
the
voices
of
women
and
children
who
murmured
and
cried
father
o
brother
o
love
o
my
child
the
man
who
was
the
accused
yet
who
was
the
judge
listened
and
his
heart
burned
and
a
longing
arose
within
him
for
the
face
of
the
father
and
the
better
way
but
then
there
came
a
clang
and
clamor
of
sound
on
the
other
side
and
voices
called
out
to
him
as
comrade
as
lover
as
friend
and
reminded
him
of
the
delights
which
once
had
been
so
sweet
to
him
and
of
the
freedom
he
loved
and
boasted
the
right
of
man
to
seek
what
was
pleasant
and
what
was
sweet
and
flouted
him
as
a
coward
whose
aim
was
to
save
himself
and
scorned
him
as
a
believer
in
old
wives
tales
and
superstitions
that
men
had
outgrown
and
their
voices
were
so
vehement
and
full
of
passion
that
by
times
they
mastered
the
others
so
that
it
was
as
if
a
tempest
raged
round
the
soul
which
sat
in
the
midst
and
who
was
the
offender
and
yet
the
judge
of
all
the
two
spectators
watched
the
conflict
as
those
who
watch
the
trial
upon
which
hangs
a
man
life
it
seemed
to
the
little
pilgrim
that
she
could
not
keep
silent
and
that
there
were
things
which
she
could
tell
him
which
no
one
knew
but
she
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
sage
and
called
to
him
you
speak
you
he
will
hear
you
and
i
too
will
speak
and
he
will
not
resist
what
we
say
but
even
as
she
said
this
eager
and
straining
against
her
companion
control
the
strangest
thing
ensued
the
man
who
was
set
there
to
judge
himself
and
his
life
he
who
was
the
criminal
yet
august
upon
his
seat
to
weigh
all
and
give
the
decision
he
before
whom
all
those
great
advocates
were
pleading
a
haze
stole
over
his
eyes
he
was
but
a
man
and
he
was
weary
and
subject
to
the
sway
of
the
little
over
the
great
the
moment
over
the
life
which
is
the
condition
of
man
while
yet
the
judgment
was
not
given
or
the
issue
decided
while
still
the
pleadings
were
in
his
ears
in
a
moment
his
head
dropped
back
upon
his
pillow
and
he
fell
asleep
he
slept
like
a
child
as
if
there
was
no
evil
nor
conflict
nor
danger
nor
questions
more
than
how
best
to
rest
when
you
are
weary
in
all
the
world
and
straightway
all
was
silent
in
the
place
those
who
had
been
conducting
this
great
cause
departed
to
other
courts
and
tribunals
having
done
all
that
was
permitted
them
to
do
and
the
man
slept
and
when
it
was
noon
woke
and
remembered
no
more
the
sage
led
the
little
pilgrim
forth
in
a
great
confusion
so
that
she
could
not
speak
for
wonder
but
he
said
sleep
also
was
from
the
father
for
the
mind
of
the
man
was
weary
and
not
able
to
form
a
judgment
it
is
adjourned
until
a
better
day
the
little
pilgrim
hung
her
head
and
cried
do
not
understand
will
not
the
lord
interfere
will
not
the
father
make
it
clear
to
him
is
he
the
judge
between
good
and
evil
is
it
all
in
his
own
hand
the
sage
spoke
softly
as
if
with
awe
he
said
is
the
burden
of
our
nature
which
is
not
like
the
angels
there
is
none
in
heaven
or
on
earth
that
can
take
from
him
what
is
his
right
and
great
honor
among
the
creatures
of
god
the
father
respects
that
which
he
has
made
he
will
force
no
child
of
his
and
there
is
no
haste
with
him
nor
has
it
ever
been
fathomed
among
us
how
long
he
will
wait
or
if
there
is
any
end
the
air
is
full
of
the
coming
and
going
of
those
who
plead
before
the
sons
of
men
and
sometimes
in
great
misery
and
trouble
there
will
be
a
cause
won
and
a
judgment
recorded
which
makes
the
universe
rejoice
and
in
everything
at
the
end
it
is
proved
that
our
lord
way
is
the
best
and
that
all
can
be
accomplished
in
his
name
the
little
pilgrim
went
on
her
way
in
silence
knowing
that
the
longing
in
her
heart
which
was
to
compel
them
to
come
in
like
that
king
who
sent
to
gather
his
guests
from
the
highways
and
the
hedges
could
not
be
right
since
it
was
not
the
father
way
yet
confused
in
her
soul
and
full
of
an
eager
desire
to
go
back
and
wake
that
man
and
tell
him
all
that
had
been
in
her
heart
while
she
watched
him
sitting
on
his
but
there
came
recollections
wafted
across
her
mind
as
by
breezes
of
the
past
of
scenes
in
her
earthly
life
when
she
had
spoken
without
avail
when
she
had
said
all
that
was
in
her
heart
and
failed
and
done
harm
when
she
had
meant
to
do
good
and
slowly
it
came
upon
her
that
her
companion
spoke
the
truth
and
that
no
man
can
save
his
brother
but
each
must
sit
and
hear
the
pleadings
and
pronounce
that
judgment
which
is
for
life
or
death
oh
she
cried
long
and
how
bitter
it
is
for
those
who
love
them
and
must
stand
by
and
can
give
no
aid
then
her
companion
unfolded
to
her
the
patience
of
the
lord
and
how
he
is
not
discouraged
nor
ever
weary
but
opens
his
great
assizes
year
by
year
and
day
by
day
and
how
the
cause
was
argued
again
as
she
had
seen
it
before
the
souls
of
men
sometimes
again
and
again
and
over
and
over
till
the
pleadings
of
the
advocates
carried
conviction
and
the
judge
perceived
the
truth
and
consented
to
it
he
showed
her
that
this
was
the
great
thing
in
human
life
and
that
though
it
was
not
enough
to
make
a
man
perfect
yet
that
he
who
sinned
against
his
will
was
different
from
the
man
who
sinned
with
his
will
and
how
in
all
things
the
choice
of
the
man
for
good
or
evil
was
all
in
all
and
he
led
her
about
the
world
so
that
she
could
see
how
everywhere
the
heavenly
advocates
were
travelling
entering
into
the
secret
places
of
the
souls
and
pleading
with
each
man
to
his
face
and
the
little
pilgrim
looked
on
with
pitying
and
tender
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
heart
of
the
judge
before
whom
that
great
question
was
debated
leaned
mostly
to
the
right
and
acknowledged
that
the
way
of
the
lord
was
the
best
way
but
either
that
sleep
overpowered
him
and
weariness
or
the
other
voices
deafened
his
ears
or
something
betrayed
him
that
he
forgot
the
reasons
of
the
wise
and
the
judgment
of
his
own
soul
at
first
it
comforted
her
to
see
how
something
nobler
in
every
man
would
answer
to
the
pleadings
and
then
her
heart
failed
her
to
perceive
that
notwithstanding
this
the
judge
would
leave
his
seat
without
a
decision
and
all
would
end
in
vanity
oh
friend
she
cried
shall
be
done
to
those
who
see
and
yet
refuse
her
heart
being
wrung
by
the
disappointment
and
the
failure
but
her
companion
smiled
still
and
he
said
are
the
children
of
the
father
can
a
woman
forget
her
child
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
she
may
forget
yet
will
not
he
forget
and
thus
they
went
on
and
on
but
time
would
not
suffice
to
tell
what
these
two
pilgrims
saw
as
they
wandered
among
the
ways
of
men
they
saw
poverty
and
misery
and
pain
which
came
of
the
evil
which
man
had
done
upon
the
earth
and
were
his
punishment
and
could
be
cured
by
nothing
but
by
the
return
of
each
to
his
father
and
the
giving
up
of
all
and
and
sin
but
amid
all
the
confusion
and
among
those
who
had
fallen
the
lowest
they
found
not
one
who
was
forsaken
whose
name
the
father
had
forgotten
or
who
was
not
made
to
pause
in
his
appointed
moment
and
to
sit
upon
his
throne
and
hear
the
pleadings
before
him
of
the
great
advocates
of
god
reasoning
of
temperance
and
righteousness
and
judgment
to
come
but
once
before
they
returned
to
their
home
a
great
thing
befell
them
and
they
beheld
that
court
sit
and
the
pleadings
made
for
the
last
time
upon
earth
which
was
a
sight
more
solemn
and
terrible
than
anything
they
had
yet
seen
they
found
themselves
in
a
chamber
where
sat
a
man
who
had
lived
long
and
known
both
good
and
evil
and
fulfilled
many
great
offices
so
that
he
was
famed
and
honored
among
men
he
was
a
man
who
was
wise
in
all
the
learning
of
the
earth
standing
but
a
little
way
below
those
who
have
begun
the
higher
learning
in
the
world
beyond
and
lifting
up
his
head
as
if
he
would
reach
the
stars
the
travellers
stood
by
him
in
his
beautiful
house
which
was
as
the
palace
of
wisdom
and
saw
him
in
the
midst
of
all
his
honors
the
lamps
were
lit
within
and
the
night
was
sweet
without
breathing
of
rest
and
happy
ease
and
riches
and
knowledge
as
if
they
would
endure
forever
and
the
man
looked
round
on
all
he
had
and
all
he
had
achieved
and
everything
which
he
possessed
to
enjoy
it
for
of
wisdom
and
of
glory
he
had
his
fill
and
his
soul
was
yet
strong
to
take
pleasure
in
what
was
his
and
he
looked
around
him
like
god
and
said
that
everything
was
good
so
that
the
little
pilgrim
gazed
and
wondered
whether
this
could
indeed
be
one
of
the
brethren
of
the
earth
or
if
he
was
one
who
had
wandered
hither
from
another
sphere
but
as
the
thought
arose
she
heard
and
lo
the
steps
of
the
pleaders
and
the
sound
of
their
entry
they
came
slowly
like
a
solemn
procession
more
grave
and
awful
in
their
looks
than
any
she
had
seen
for
they
were
great
and
the
greatest
of
all
such
as
come
forth
but
rarely
when
the
last
word
is
to
be
said
the
words
they
said
were
few
but
they
stood
round
him
reminding
him
of
all
that
had
been
and
of
what
must
be
and
of
many
things
which
were
known
but
to
god
and
him
alone
and
calling
upon
him
yet
once
more
before
time
should
come
to
an
end
and
life
be
lost
but
the
sound
of
their
voices
in
his
ear
was
but
as
some
great
strain
of
music
which
he
had
heard
many
times
and
knew
and
heeded
not
he
turned
to
the
goods
which
he
had
laid
up
for
many
years
and
all
the
knowledge
he
had
stored
and
said
to
himself
take
thine
ease
and
to
the
heavenly
advocates
he
smiled
and
replied
that
life
was
strong
and
wisdom
the
master
of
all
then
there
came
a
chill
and
a
shiver
over
all
as
if
the
earth
had
been
stopped
in
her
career
or
the
sun
fallen
from
the
sky
and
the
little
pilgrim
looking
on
could
see
the
heavenly
pleaders
come
forth
with
bowed
heads
and
the
door
of
hope
shut
to
and
a
whisper
which
crept
about
from
sea
to
sea
and
said
vain
in
vain
and
as
they
went
forth
from
the
gates
an
icy
breath
swept
in
and
the
voice
of
the
saying
fool
this
night
thy
soul
shall
be
required
of
thee
the
sound
went
through
her
heart
as
if
it
had
been
pierced
by
a
sword
and
she
gave
a
cry
of
anguish
for
she
could
not
bear
that
a
brother
should
be
lost
but
when
she
looked
up
at
the
face
of
her
companion
though
it
was
pale
with
the
pity
and
the
terror
of
that
which
had
been
thus
accomplished
there
was
still
upon
it
a
smile
and
he
said
yet
not
yet
the
father
loves
not
less
but
more
than
ever
friend
she
cried
there
ever
come
a
moment
when
the
father
will
forget
is
there
any
place
where
he
can
not
go
then
he
who
was
wise
turned
towards
her
and
a
great
light
came
upon
his
face
and
he
said
have
searched
the
records
and
heard
all
witnesses
from
the
beginnings
of
time
but
we
have
never
found
the
boundary
of
his
mercy
and
there
is
no
country
known
to
man
that
is
without
his
presence
and
never
has
it
been
known
that
he
has
shut
his
ear
to
those
who
called
upon
him
or
forgotten
one
who
is
his
the
heavenly
pleaders
may
be
silenced
but
never
our
lord
who
pleads
for
all
and
heaven
and
earth
may
forget
yet
will
he
never
forget
who
is
the
father
of
all
and
every
child
of
his
is
to
him
as
if
there
was
none
other
in
the
world
then
the
little
pilgrim
lifted
her
face
and
beheld
that
radiance
which
is
over
all
which
is
the
love
that
lights
the
world
both
angels
and
the
great
spheres
above
and
the
little
brethren
who
stumble
and
struggle
and
weep
and
in
that
light
there
was
no
darkness
at
all
but
everything
shone
as
in
the
morning
sweet
yet
terrible
but
ever
clear
and
fair
and
immediately
ere
she
was
aware
the
rough
roads
of
the
earth
were
left
far
behind
and
she
had
returned
to
her
place
and
to
her
peaceful
state
and
to
the
work
which
had
been
given
her
to
receive
the
wanderers
and
to
bid
them
a
happy
welcome
as
the
doors
opened
and
they
entered
into
their
inheritance
and
thus
her
soul
was
satisfied
though
she
knew
now
nothing
more
than
she
had
known
always
that
the
eye
of
the
father
is
over
all
and
that
he
can
neither
forget
nor
forsake
ii
on
the
dark
mountains
when
the
little
pilgrim
had
been
thus
permitted
to
see
the
secret
workings
of
god
in
earthly
places
and
among
the
brethren
who
are
still
in
the
land
of
hope
these
being
things
which
the
angels
desire
to
look
into
and
which
are
the
subject
of
story
and
of
song
not
only
in
the
little
world
below
but
in
the
great
realms
above
her
heart
for
a
long
time
reposed
and
was
satisfied
and
asked
no
further
question
for
she
had
seen
what
the
dealings
of
the
father
were
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
how
till
the
end
came
he
did
not
cease
to
send
his
messengers
to
plead
in
every
heart
and
to
hold
a
court
of
justice
that
no
man
might
be
deceived
but
each
know
whither
his
steps
were
tending
and
what
was
the
way
of
wisdom
after
this
it
was
permitted
to
her
to
read
in
the
archives
of
the
heavenly
country
the
story
of
one
who
neglecting
all
that
the
advocates
of
god
could
say
had
found
himself
when
the
little
life
was
completed
not
upon
the
threshold
of
a
better
country
but
in
the
midst
of
the
land
of
darkness
that
region
in
which
the
souls
of
men
are
left
by
god
to
their
own
devices
and
the
father
stands
aloof
and
hides
his
face
and
calls
them
not
neither
persuades
them
more
over
this
story
the
little
pilgrim
had
shed
many
tears
for
she
knew
well
being
enlightened
in
her
great
simplicity
by
the
heavenly
wisdom
that
it
was
pain
and
grief
to
the
father
to
turn
away
his
face
and
that
no
one
who
has
but
the
little
heart
of
a
man
can
imagine
to
himself
what
that
sorrow
is
in
the
being
of
the
great
god
and
a
great
awe
came
over
her
mind
at
the
thought
which
seemed
a
blasphemy
that
he
could
grieve
yet
in
her
heart
being
his
child
she
knew
that
it
was
true
and
her
own
little
spirit
throbbed
through
and
through
with
longing
and
with
desire
to
help
those
who
were
thus
utterly
lost
oh
she
said
i
could
but
go
there
is
nothing
which
could
make
a
child
afraid
save
to
see
them
suffer
what
are
darkness
and
terror
when
the
father
is
with
you
i
am
not
afraid
if
i
might
but
go
and
by
reason
of
her
often
pleading
and
of
the
thought
that
was
ever
in
her
mind
it
was
at
last
said
that
one
of
those
who
knew
might
instruct
her
and
show
her
by
what
way
alone
the
travellers
who
come
from
that
miserable
land
could
approach
and
be
admitted
on
high
know
she
said
between
us
and
them
there
is
a
gulf
fixed
and
that
they
who
would
come
from
thence
can
not
come
neither
can
any
one
but
here
she
stopped
in
great
dismay
for
it
seemed
that
she
had
thus
answered
her
own
longing
and
prayer
the
guide
who
had
come
for
her
smiled
upon
her
and
said
that
was
before
the
lord
had
ended
his
work
and
now
all
the
paths
are
free
wherever
there
is
a
or
a
the
roads
are
all
blessed
and
they
are
all
open
and
no
barriers
for
those
who
will
she
cried
friend
is
that
true
for
all
he
looked
away
from
her
into
the
depths
of
the
lovely
air
and
he
replied
sister
our
faith
is
without
bounds
but
not
our
knowledge
i
who
speak
to
you
am
no
more
than
a
man
the
princes
and
powers
that
are
in
high
places
know
more
than
i
but
if
there
be
any
place
where
a
heart
can
stir
and
cry
out
to
the
father
and
he
take
no
heed
if
it
be
only
in
a
groan
if
it
be
only
with
a
sigh
i
know
not
that
place
yet
many
depths
i
know
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
hers
after
a
pause
and
then
he
said
are
some
who
are
stumbling
upon
the
dark
mountains
come
and
see
as
they
passed
along
there
were
many
who
paused
to
look
at
them
for
he
had
the
mien
of
a
great
prince
a
lord
among
men
and
his
face
still
bore
the
trace
of
sorrow
and
toil
and
there
was
about
him
an
awe
and
wonder
which
was
more
than
could
be
put
in
words
so
that
those
who
saw
him
understood
as
he
went
by
not
who
he
was
nor
what
he
had
been
but
that
he
had
come
out
of
great
tribulation
of
sorrow
beyond
the
sorrows
of
men
the
sweetness
of
the
heavenly
country
had
soothed
away
his
care
and
taken
the
cloud
from
his
face
but
he
was
as
yet
unaccustomed
to
smile
though
when
he
remembered
and
looked
round
him
and
saw
that
all
was
well
his
countenance
lightened
like
the
morning
sky
and
his
eyes
woke
up
in
splendor
like
the
sun
rising
the
little
pilgrim
did
not
know
who
her
brother
was
but
yet
gave
thanks
to
god
for
him
she
knew
not
why
how
far
they
went
can
not
be
estimated
in
words
for
distance
matters
little
in
that
place
but
at
the
end
they
came
to
a
path
which
sloped
a
little
downwards
to
the
edge
of
a
delightful
moorland
country
all
brilliant
with
the
hues
of
the
mountain
flowers
it
was
like
a
flowery
plateau
high
among
the
hills
in
a
region
where
are
no
frosts
to
check
the
glow
of
the
flowers
or
scorch
the
grass
it
spread
far
around
in
hollows
and
ravines
and
softly
swelling
hills
with
the
rush
over
them
of
a
cheerful
breeze
full
of
mountain
scents
and
sounds
and
high
above
them
rose
the
mountain
heights
of
the
celestial
world
veiled
in
those
blue
breadths
of
distance
which
are
heaven
itself
when
man
fancy
ascends
to
them
from
the
low
world
at
their
feet
all
the
little
earth
can
do
in
color
and
mists
and
travelling
shadows
fleet
as
the
breath
and
the
sweet
steadfast
shining
of
the
sun
was
there
but
with
a
splendor
they
rose
up
into
the
sky
every
peak
and
jagged
rock
all
touched
with
the
light
and
the
smile
of
god
and
every
little
blossom
on
the
turf
rejoicing
in
the
warmth
and
freedom
and
peace
the
heart
of
the
little
pilgrim
swelled
and
she
cried
out
is
nothing
so
glorious
as
the
everlasting
hills
though
the
valleys
and
the
plains
are
sweet
they
are
not
like
them
they
say
to
us
lift
up
your
heart
her
guide
smiled
but
he
did
not
speak
his
smile
was
full
of
joy
but
grave
like
that
of
a
man
whose
thoughts
are
bent
on
other
things
and
he
pointed
where
the
road
wound
downwards
by
the
feet
of
these
triumphant
hills
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
them
as
she
moved
along
those
heights
rose
into
the
very
sky
but
bore
upon
them
neither
snow
nor
storm
here
and
there
a
whiteness
like
a
film
of
air
rounded
out
over
a
peak
and
she
recognized
that
it
was
one
of
those
angels
who
travel
far
and
wide
with
god
commissions
going
to
the
other
worlds
that
are
in
the
firmament
as
in
a
sea
the
softness
of
these
films
of
white
was
like
the
summer
clouds
that
she
used
to
watch
in
the
blue
of
the
summer
sky
in
the
little
world
which
none
of
its
children
can
cease
to
love
and
she
wondered
now
whether
it
might
not
sometimes
have
been
the
same
dear
angels
whose
flight
she
had
watched
unknowing
higher
than
thought
could
soar
or
knowledge
penetrate
watching
those
floating
heavenly
messengers
and
the
heights
of
the
great
miraculous
mountains
rising
up
into
the
sky
the
little
pilgrim
ceased
to
think
whither
she
was
going
although
she
knew
from
the
feeling
of
the
ground
under
her
feet
that
she
was
descending
still
softly
but
more
quickly
than
at
first
until
she
was
brought
to
herself
by
the
sensation
of
a
great
wind
coming
in
her
face
cold
as
from
a
sudden
vacancy
she
turned
her
head
quickly
from
gazing
above
to
what
was
before
her
and
started
with
a
cry
of
wonder
for
below
lay
a
great
gulf
of
darkness
out
of
which
rose
at
first
some
shadowy
peaks
and
shoulders
of
rock
all
falling
away
into
a
gloom
which
eyes
accustomed
to
the
sunshine
could
not
penetrate
where
she
stood
was
the
edge
of
the
light
before
her
feet
lay
a
line
of
shadow
slowly
darkening
out
of
daylight
into
twilight
and
beyond
into
that
measureless
blackness
of
night
and
the
wind
in
her
face
was
like
that
which
comes
from
a
great
depth
below
of
either
sea
or
land
the
sweep
of
the
current
which
moves
a
vast
atmosphere
in
which
there
is
nothing
to
break
its
force
the
little
pilgrim
was
so
startled
by
these
unexpected
sensations
that
she
caught
the
arm
of
her
guide
in
her
sudden
alarm
and
clung
to
him
lest
she
should
fall
into
the
terrible
darkness
and
the
deep
abyss
below
is
nothing
to
fear
he
said
is
a
way
to
us
who
are
above
there
is
no
danger
at
all
and
it
is
the
way
of
life
to
those
who
are
below
see
nothing
she
cried
a
few
points
of
rock
and
the
precipice
the
pit
which
is
below
oh
tell
me
what
is
it
is
it
where
the
fires
are
and
despair
dwells
i
did
not
think
that
was
true
let
me
go
and
hide
myself
and
not
see
it
for
i
never
thought
that
was
true
again
said
the
guide
the
little
pilgrim
shrank
into
a
crevice
of
the
rock
and
uncovering
her
eyes
gazed
into
the
darkness
and
because
her
nature
was
soft
and
timid
there
came
into
her
mind
a
momentary
fear
her
heart
flew
to
the
footstool
and
cried
out
to
him
not
any
question
or
prayer
but
only
father
and
this
made
her
stand
erect
and
strengthened
her
eyes
so
that
the
gloom
even
of
hell
could
no
more
make
her
afraid
her
guide
stood
beside
with
a
steadfast
countenance
which
was
grave
yet
full
of
a
solemn
light
and
then
all
at
once
he
lifted
up
his
voice
which
was
sonorous
and
sweet
like
the
sound
of
an
organ
and
uttered
a
shout
so
great
and
resounding
that
it
seemed
to
come
back
in
echoes
from
every
hollow
and
hill
what
he
said
the
little
pilgrim
could
not
understand
but
when
the
echoes
had
died
away
and
silence
followed
something
came
up
through
the
gloom
a
sound
that
was
far
far
away
and
faint
in
the
long
distance
a
voice
that
sounded
no
more
than
an
echo
when
he
who
had
called
out
heard
it
he
turned
to
the
little
pilgrim
with
eyes
that
were
liquid
with
love
and
pity
he
said
is
some
one
on
the
way
we
help
them
cried
the
little
pilgrim
her
heart
bounded
forward
like
a
bird
she
had
no
fear
the
darkness
and
the
horrible
way
seemed
as
nothing
to
her
she
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
she
would
have
seized
the
traveller
and
dragged
him
up
into
the
light
he
who
was
by
her
side
shook
his
head
but
with
a
smile
can
but
wait
he
said
is
forbidden
that
any
one
should
help
for
this
is
too
terrible
and
strange
to
be
touched
even
by
the
hands
of
angels
it
is
like
nothing
that
you
know
have
been
taught
many
things
said
the
little
pilgrim
humbly
have
been
taken
back
to
the
dear
earth
where
i
saw
the
and
the
pleaders
who
spoke
and
the
man
who
was
the
judge
and
how
each
is
judge
for
himself
have
seen
the
place
of
hope
said
her
guide
the
father
is
and
the
son
and
where
no
man
is
left
to
his
own
ways
but
there
is
another
country
where
there
is
no
voice
either
from
god
or
from
good
spirits
and
where
those
who
have
refused
are
left
to
do
as
seems
good
in
their
own
eyes
have
read
said
the
little
pilgrim
with
a
sob
one
who
went
from
city
to
city
and
found
no
rest
her
guide
bowed
his
head
very
gravely
in
assent
go
from
place
to
place
he
said
haply
they
might
find
one
in
which
it
is
possible
to
live
whether
it
is
order
or
whether
it
is
license
it
is
according
to
their
own
will
they
try
all
things
ever
looking
for
something
which
the
soul
may
endure
and
new
cities
are
founded
from
time
to
time
and
a
new
endeavor
ever
and
ever
to
live
only
to
live
for
even
when
happiness
fails
and
content
and
work
is
vanity
and
effort
is
naught
it
is
something
if
a
man
can
but
endure
to
live
the
little
pilgrim
looked
at
him
with
wistful
eyes
for
what
he
said
was
beyond
her
understanding
us
she
said
is
nothing
but
joy
oh
brother
is
there
then
condemnation
is
no
condemnation
it
is
what
they
have
chosen
it
is
to
follow
their
own
way
there
is
no
longer
any
one
to
interfere
the
pleaders
are
all
silent
there
is
no
voice
in
the
heart
the
father
hinders
them
not
nor
helps
them
but
leaves
them
he
shivered
as
if
with
cold
and
the
little
pilgrim
felt
that
there
breathed
from
the
depths
of
darkness
at
their
feet
an
icy
wind
which
touched
her
hands
and
feet
and
chilled
her
heart
she
shivered
too
and
drew
close
to
the
rock
for
shelter
and
gazed
at
the
awful
cliffs
rising
out
of
the
gloom
and
the
paths
that
disappeared
at
her
feet
leading
down
down
into
that
abyss
and
her
heart
failed
within
her
to
think
that
below
there
were
souls
that
suffered
and
that
the
father
and
the
son
were
not
there
he
the
the
how
could
it
be
that
he
was
not
there
is
a
mystery
said
the
man
who
was
her
guide
and
who
answered
to
her
thought
i
set
my
foot
upon
this
blessed
land
i
knew
that
there
even
there
he
is
but
in
that
country
his
face
is
hidden
and
even
to
name
his
name
is
anguish
for
then
only
do
men
understand
what
has
befallen
them
who
can
say
that
name
no
more
is
death
indeed
she
cried
and
the
wind
came
up
silent
with
a
wild
breath
that
was
more
awful
than
the
shriek
of
a
storm
for
it
was
like
the
stifled
utterances
of
all
those
miserable
ones
who
have
no
voice
to
call
upon
god
and
know
not
where
he
is
nor
how
to
pronounce
his
name
said
he
we
could
have
known
what
death
was
we
had
believed
in
death
in
the
time
of
all
great
illusions
in
the
time
of
the
gentle
life
in
the
day
of
hope
but
in
the
land
of
darkness
there
are
no
illusions
and
every
man
knows
that
though
he
should
fling
himself
into
the
furnace
of
the
gold
or
be
cut
to
pieces
by
the
knives
or
trampled
under
the
dancers
feet
yet
that
it
will
be
but
a
little
more
pain
and
that
death
is
not
nor
any
escape
that
way
brother
she
cried
have
been
there
he
turned
and
looked
upon
her
and
she
read
as
in
a
book
things
which
tongue
of
man
can
not
say
the
anguish
and
the
rapture
the
unforgotten
pang
of
the
lost
the
joy
of
one
who
has
been
delivered
after
hope
was
gone
have
been
there
and
now
i
stand
in
the
light
and
have
seen
the
face
of
the
lord
and
can
speak
his
blessed
name
and
with
that
he
burst
forth
into
a
great
melodious
cry
which
was
not
like
that
which
he
had
sent
into
the
dark
depths
below
but
mounted
up
like
the
sounding
of
silver
trumpets
and
all
joyful
music
giving
a
voice
to
the
sweet
air
and
the
fresh
winds
which
blew
about
the
hills
of
god
but
the
words
he
said
were
not
comprehensible
to
his
companion
for
they
were
in
the
sweet
tongue
which
is
between
the
father
and
his
child
and
known
to
none
but
to
them
alone
yet
only
to
hear
the
sound
was
enough
to
transport
all
who
listened
and
to
make
them
know
what
joy
is
and
peace
the
little
pilgrim
wept
for
happiness
to
hear
her
brother
voice
but
in
the
midst
of
it
her
ear
was
caught
by
another
sound
a
faint
cry
which
tingled
up
from
the
darkness
like
a
note
of
a
muffled
bell
and
she
turned
from
the
joy
and
the
light
and
flung
out
her
arms
and
her
little
voice
towards
him
who
was
stumbling
upon
the
dark
mountains
and
she
cried
come
forgetting
all
things
save
that
one
was
there
in
the
darkness
while
here
was
light
and
peace
is
nearer
said
her
guide
hearing
even
in
the
midst
of
his
triumph
song
that
faint
and
distant
cry
and
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
back
for
she
was
upon
the
edge
of
the
precipice
gazing
into
the
black
depths
which
revealed
nothing
save
the
needles
of
the
awful
rocks
and
sheer
descents
below
moment
will
come
he
said
we
can
help
but
it
is
not
yet
her
heart
was
in
the
depths
with
him
who
was
coming
whom
she
knew
not
save
that
he
was
coming
toiling
upwards
towards
the
light
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
not
contain
herself
nor
wait
till
he
should
appear
nor
draw
back
from
the
edge
where
she
might
hold
out
her
hands
to
him
and
save
him
some
single
step
if
no
more
but
presently
her
heart
returned
to
her
brother
who
stood
by
her
side
and
who
was
delivered
and
with
whom
it
was
meet
that
all
should
rejoice
since
he
had
fought
and
conquered
and
reached
the
land
of
light
she
said
is
long
to
wait
while
he
is
still
upon
these
dark
mountains
tell
me
how
it
came
to
you
to
find
the
way
he
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
though
his
ear
too
was
intent
and
his
heart
fixed
upon
the
traveller
in
the
darkness
and
began
to
tell
her
his
tale
to
beguile
the
time
of
waiting
and
to
hold
within
bounds
the
pity
that
filled
her
heart
he
told
her
that
he
was
one
of
many
who
came
from
the
pleasant
earth
together
out
of
many
countries
and
tongues
and
how
they
had
gone
here
and
there
each
man
to
a
different
city
and
how
they
had
crossed
each
other
paths
coming
and
going
yet
never
found
rest
for
their
feet
and
how
there
was
a
little
relief
in
every
change
and
one
sought
that
which
another
left
and
how
they
wandered
round
and
round
over
all
the
vast
and
endless
plain
until
at
length
in
revolt
from
every
other
way
they
had
chosen
a
spot
upon
the
slope
of
a
hill
and
built
there
a
new
city
if
perhaps
something
better
might
be
found
there
and
how
it
had
been
built
with
towers
and
high
walls
and
great
gates
to
shut
it
in
so
that
no
stranger
should
find
entrance
and
how
every
house
was
a
palace
with
statues
of
marble
and
pillars
so
precious
with
beautiful
work
and
arches
so
lofty
and
so
fair
that
they
were
better
than
had
they
been
made
of
gold
yet
gold
was
not
wanting
nor
diamond
stones
that
shone
like
stars
and
everything
more
beautiful
and
stately
than
heart
could
conceive
while
we
built
and
labored
he
said
hearts
were
a
little
appeased
and
it
was
called
the
city
of
art
and
all
was
perfect
in
it
so
that
nothing
had
ever
been
seen
to
compare
with
it
for
beauty
and
we
walked
upon
the
battlements
and
looked
over
the
plain
and
viewed
the
dwellers
there
who
were
not
as
we
and
we
went
on
to
fill
every
room
and
every
hall
with
carved
work
in
stone
and
beaten
gold
and
pictures
and
woven
tissues
that
were
like
the
and
the
rainbows
of
the
pleasant
earth
and
crowds
came
around
envying
us
and
seeking
to
enter
but
we
closed
our
gates
and
drove
them
away
and
it
was
said
among
us
that
life
would
now
become
as
of
old
and
everything
would
go
well
with
us
as
in
the
happy
days
the
little
pilgrim
looked
up
into
his
face
and
for
pity
of
his
pain
though
it
was
past
almost
wished
that
could
have
come
true
when
the
work
was
done
he
said
and
for
a
moment
no
more
brother
when
the
work
was
done
do
not
know
what
it
is
he
said
be
ten
times
more
powerful
and
strong
to
want
no
rest
to
have
fire
in
your
veins
to
have
the
craving
in
your
heart
above
everything
that
is
known
to
man
when
the
work
was
done
we
glared
upon
each
other
with
hungry
eyes
and
each
man
wished
to
thrust
forth
his
neighbor
and
possess
all
to
himself
and
then
we
ceased
to
take
pleasure
in
it
notwithstanding
that
it
was
beautiful
and
there
were
some
who
would
have
beaten
down
the
walls
and
built
them
anew
and
some
would
have
torn
up
the
silver
and
gold
and
tossed
out
the
fair
statues
and
the
adornments
in
scorn
and
rage
to
the
meaner
multitudes
below
and
we
who
were
the
workers
began
to
contend
one
against
another
to
satisfy
the
gnawings
of
the
rage
that
was
in
our
hearts
for
we
had
deceived
ourselves
thinking
once
more
that
all
would
be
well
while
all
the
time
nothing
was
changed
and
we
were
but
as
the
miserable
ones
that
rushed
from
place
to
place
though
all
this
wretchedness
was
over
and
past
it
was
so
terrible
to
think
of
that
he
paused
and
was
silent
awhile
and
the
little
pilgrim
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
in
her
great
pity
to
soothe
him
and
almost
forgot
that
there
was
another
traveller
not
yet
delivered
upon
the
way
but
suddenly
at
that
moment
there
came
up
through
the
depths
the
sound
of
a
fall
as
if
the
rocks
had
crashed
from
a
hundred
peaks
yet
all
muffled
by
the
great
distance
and
echoing
all
around
in
faint
echoes
and
rumblings
as
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
and
mingled
with
them
were
cries
so
faint
and
distant
that
human
ears
could
not
have
heard
them
like
the
cries
of
lost
children
or
creatures
wavering
and
straying
in
the
midst
of
the
boundless
night
this
time
she
who
was
watching
upon
the
edge
of
the
gloom
would
have
flung
herself
forward
altogether
into
it
had
not
her
companion
again
restrained
her
has
stumbled
upon
the
mountains
but
listen
listen
little
sister
for
the
voices
are
many
he
said
is
not
one
who
comes
but
many
and
though
he
falls
he
will
rise
again
and
once
more
he
shouted
aloud
bending
down
against
the
rocks
so
that
they
caught
his
voice
and
the
sweet
air
from
the
skies
came
behind
him
in
a
great
gust
like
a
summer
storm
and
carried
it
into
all
the
echoing
hollows
of
the
hills
and
the
little
pilgrim
knew
that
he
shouted
to
all
who
came
to
take
courage
and
not
to
fear
and
this
time
there
rose
upwards
many
faint
and
wavering
sounds
that
did
not
stir
the
air
but
made
it
tingle
with
a
vibration
of
the
great
distance
and
the
unknown
depths
and
then
again
all
was
still
they
stood
for
a
time
intent
upon
the
great
silence
and
darkness
which
swept
up
all
sight
and
sound
and
then
the
little
pilgrim
once
more
turned
her
eyes
towards
her
companion
and
he
began
again
his
wonderful
tale
who
had
been
the
first
to
found
the
city
and
who
was
the
most
wise
of
any
though
the
rage
was
in
him
like
all
the
rest
and
the
disappointment
and
the
anguish
yet
would
not
yield
and
he
called
upon
us
for
another
trial
to
make
a
picture
which
should
be
the
greatest
that
ever
was
painted
and
each
one
of
us
small
or
great
who
had
been
of
that
art
in
the
dear
life
took
share
in
the
rivalry
and
the
emulation
so
that
on
every
side
there
was
a
fury
and
a
rush
each
man
with
his
band
of
supporters
about
him
struggling
and
swearing
that
his
was
the
best
not
that
they
loved
the
work
or
the
beauty
of
the
work
but
to
keep
down
the
gnawing
in
their
hearts
and
to
have
something
for
which
they
could
still
fight
and
storm
and
for
a
little
forget
was
one
who
had
been
among
the
highest
he
spoke
not
with
pride
but
in
a
low
and
deep
voice
which
went
to
the
heart
of
the
listener
and
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
it
was
not
like
that
of
the
painter
in
the
heavenly
city
who
rejoiced
and
was
glad
in
his
work
though
he
was
but
as
a
humble
workman
serving
those
who
were
more
great
but
this
man
had
the
sorrow
of
greatness
in
him
and
the
wonder
of
those
who
can
do
much
to
find
how
little
they
can
do
veins
he
said
filled
with
fire
and
my
heart
with
the
rage
of
a
great
desire
to
be
first
as
i
had
been
first
in
the
days
of
the
gentle
life
and
i
made
my
plan
to
be
greater
than
all
the
rest
to
paint
a
vast
picture
like
the
world
filled
with
all
the
glories
of
life
in
a
moment
i
had
conceived
what
i
should
do
for
my
strength
was
as
that
of
a
hundred
men
and
none
of
us
could
rest
or
breathe
till
it
was
accomplished
but
flung
ourselves
upon
this
new
thing
as
upon
water
in
the
desert
oh
my
little
sister
how
can
i
tell
you
what
words
can
show
forth
this
wonderful
thing
i
stood
before
my
great
canvas
with
all
those
who
were
of
my
faction
pressing
upon
me
noting
every
touch
i
made
shouting
and
saying
he
will
win
he
will
win
when
lo
there
came
a
mystery
and
a
wonder
into
that
place
i
had
arranged
men
and
women
before
me
according
to
all
the
devices
of
art
to
serve
as
my
models
that
nature
might
be
in
my
picture
and
life
but
when
i
looked
i
saw
them
not
for
between
them
and
me
had
come
a
face
the
eyes
of
the
little
pilgrim
dropped
with
tears
she
held
out
her
hands
towards
him
with
a
sympathy
which
no
words
could
say
had
i
painted
that
face
in
the
other
life
sometimes
with
awe
and
love
sometimes
with
scorn
for
hire
and
for
bread
and
for
pride
and
for
fame
it
is
pale
with
suffering
yet
smiles
the
eyes
have
tears
in
them
yet
light
below
and
all
that
is
there
is
full
of
tenderness
and
of
love
there
is
a
crown
upon
the
brow
but
it
is
made
of
thorns
it
came
before
me
suddenly
while
i
stood
there
with
the
men
shouting
close
to
my
ear
urging
me
on
and
fierce
fury
in
my
heart
and
the
rage
to
be
first
and
to
forget
where
my
models
were
there
it
came
i
could
not
see
them
nor
my
groups
that
i
had
planned
nor
anything
but
that
face
i
called
out
to
my
men
who
has
done
this
but
they
heard
me
not
nor
understood
me
for
to
them
there
was
nothing
there
save
the
figures
i
had
set
a
living
picture
all
ready
for
the
painter
hand
could
not
bear
it
the
sight
of
that
face
i
flung
my
tools
away
i
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hands
but
those
who
were
about
me
pressed
on
me
and
threatened
they
pulled
my
hands
from
my
eyes
coward
they
cried
and
traitor
to
leave
us
in
the
lurch
now
will
the
other
side
win
and
we
be
shamed
rather
tear
him
limb
from
limb
fling
him
from
the
walls
the
crowd
came
round
me
like
an
angry
sea
they
forced
my
pencils
back
into
my
hands
work
they
cried
or
we
will
tear
you
limb
from
limb
for
though
they
were
upon
my
side
it
was
for
rivalry
and
not
out
of
any
love
for
me
he
paused
for
a
moment
for
his
heart
was
yet
full
of
the
remembrance
and
of
joy
that
it
was
past
looked
again
he
said
still
it
was
there
o
face
divine
the
eyes
all
wet
with
pity
the
lips
all
quivering
with
love
and
neither
pity
nor
love
belonged
to
that
place
nor
any
succor
nor
the
touch
of
a
brother
nor
the
voice
of
a
friend
paint
they
cried
or
we
will
tear
you
limb
from
limb
and
fire
came
into
my
heart
i
pushed
them
from
me
on
every
side
with
the
strength
of
a
giant
and
then
i
flung
it
on
the
canvas
crying
i
know
not
what
not
to
them
but
to
him
shrink
not
from
me
little
sister
for
i
blasphemed
i
called
him
impostor
deceiver
galilean
and
still
with
all
my
might
with
all
the
fury
of
my
soul
i
set
him
there
for
every
man
to
see
not
knowing
what
i
did
everything
faded
from
me
but
that
face
i
saw
it
alone
the
crowd
came
round
me
with
shouts
and
threats
to
drag
me
away
but
i
took
no
heed
they
were
silenced
and
fled
and
left
me
alone
but
i
knew
nothing
nor
when
they
came
back
with
others
and
seized
me
and
flung
me
forth
from
the
gates
was
i
aware
what
i
had
done
they
cast
me
out
and
left
me
upon
the
wild
without
a
shelter
without
a
companion
storming
and
raving
at
them
as
they
did
at
me
they
dashed
the
great
gates
behind
me
with
a
clang
and
shut
me
out
and
i
turned
and
defied
them
and
cursed
them
as
they
cursed
me
not
knowing
what
i
had
done
brother
murmured
the
little
pilgrim
kneeling
as
if
she
had
accompanied
him
all
the
way
with
her
prayers
but
could
not
now
say
more
i
saw
again
he
went
on
not
hearing
her
in
the
great
force
of
that
passion
and
wonder
which
was
still
in
his
mind
vision
in
the
air
wherever
i
turned
it
was
there
his
eyes
wet
with
pity
his
countenance
shining
with
love
whence
came
he
what
did
he
in
that
place
where
love
is
not
where
pity
comes
not
she
cried
seek
you
there
her
companion
bowed
his
head
in
deep
humbleness
and
joy
and
again
he
lifted
his
great
voice
and
intoned
his
song
of
praise
the
little
pilgrim
understood
it
but
by
fragments
a
line
that
was
more
simple
that
came
here
and
there
and
it
praised
the
lord
that
where
the
face
of
the
father
was
hidden
and
where
love
was
not
nor
compassion
nor
brother
had
pity
on
brother
nor
friend
knew
the
face
of
friend
and
all
succor
was
stayed
and
every
help
forbidden
yet
still
in
the
depths
of
the
darkness
and
in
the
heart
of
the
silence
he
who
could
not
forget
nor
forsake
was
there
the
voice
of
the
singer
was
like
that
of
one
of
the
great
angels
and
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
blessed
country
began
to
appear
gathering
in
crowds
to
hear
this
great
music
as
the
little
sister
thought
and
she
herself
listened
with
all
her
heart
wondering
and
seeing
on
the
faces
of
those
dear
friends
whom
she
did
not
know
an
expectation
and
a
hope
which
were
strange
to
her
though
she
could
always
understand
their
love
and
their
joy
but
in
the
middle
of
this
great
song
there
came
again
another
sound
to
her
ear
a
sound
which
pierced
through
the
music
like
lightning
through
the
sky
though
it
was
but
the
cry
of
one
distraught
and
fainting
a
cry
out
of
the
depths
not
even
seeking
help
a
cry
of
distress
too
terrible
to
be
borne
though
it
was
scarcely
louder
than
a
sigh
she
heard
it
through
all
the
music
and
turned
and
flew
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
whence
it
came
and
immediately
the
darkness
seemed
to
move
as
with
a
pulse
in
a
great
throb
and
something
came
through
the
wind
with
a
rush
as
if
part
of
the
mountain
had
fallen
and
lo
at
her
feet
lay
one
who
had
flung
himself
forward
his
arms
stretched
out
his
face
to
the
ground
as
if
he
had
seized
and
grasped
in
an
agony
the
very
soil
he
lay
there
half
in
the
light
and
half
in
the
shadow
gripping
the
rocks
with
his
hands
burrowing
into
the
cool
herbage
above
and
the
mountain
flowers
clinging
catching
hold
despairing
yet
seizing
everything
he
could
grasp
the
tender
grass
the
rolling
stones
the
little
pilgrim
flung
herself
down
upon
her
knees
by
his
side
and
grasped
his
arm
to
help
and
cried
aloud
for
aid
and
the
song
of
the
singer
ceased
and
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
so
that
the
breath
of
the
fugitive
could
be
heard
panting
and
his
strong
struggle
to
drag
himself
altogether
out
of
that
abyss
of
darkness
below
she
thought
of
nothing
nor
heard
nor
saw
anything
but
the
strain
of
that
last
effort
which
seemed
to
shake
the
very
mountains
until
suddenly
there
seemed
to
rise
all
around
the
hum
and
murmur
as
of
a
great
multitude
and
looking
up
she
saw
every
little
hill
and
hollow
and
the
glorious
plain
beyond
as
far
as
eye
could
see
crowded
with
countless
throngs
and
on
the
high
peaks
above
in
the
full
shining
of
the
sun
came
bands
of
angels
and
of
those
great
beings
who
are
more
mighty
than
men
and
the
eyes
of
all
were
fixed
upon
the
man
who
lay
as
one
dead
upon
the
ground
and
from
the
lips
of
all
came
a
low
murmur
of
rapture
and
delight
that
spread
like
the
hum
of
the
bees
like
the
cooing
of
the
doves
like
the
voice
of
a
mother
over
her
child
and
the
same
sound
came
to
her
own
lips
unawares
and
she
murmured
and
and
not
knowing
what
she
said
and
looking
to
the
others
whispered
for
he
is
weak
and
all
of
them
answered
with
tears
with
and
and
and
and
and
stood
smiling
and
weeping
for
joy
and
presently
there
came
softly
into
the
blessed
air
the
ringing
of
the
great
silver
bells
which
sound
only
for
victory
and
great
happiness
and
gain
and
there
was
joy
in
heaven
and
every
world
was
stirred
and
throughout
the
firmament
and
among
all
the
lords
and
princes
of
life
it
was
known
that
the
impossible
had
become
true
and
the
name
of
the
lord
had
proved
enough
and
love
had
conquered
even
despair
she
said
he
is
weak
and
because
it
was
her
blessed
service
to
receive
those
who
had
newly
arrived
in
that
heavenly
country
and
to
soothe
and
help
them
so
that
like
newborn
children
they
should
be
able
to
endure
and
understand
the
joy
she
knelt
by
him
on
the
ground
and
tried
to
rouse
him
though
with
trembling
for
never
before
had
she
stood
by
one
who
was
newly
come
out
of
the
land
of
despair
the
sun
come
upon
him
she
said
him
feel
the
brightness
of
the
light
and
with
her
soft
hands
she
drew
him
out
of
the
shade
of
the
twilight
to
where
the
brightness
of
the
day
fell
like
a
smile
upon
the
flowers
and
then
at
last
he
stirred
and
turned
round
and
opened
his
eyes
for
the
genial
warmth
had
reached
him
but
his
eyes
were
heavy
and
dazzled
with
the
light
and
he
looked
round
him
as
if
confused
from
beneath
his
heavy
eyelids
where
am
i
he
said
who
are
you
brother
said
the
little
pilgrim
and
told
him
in
his
ear
the
name
of
that
heavenly
place
and
many
comforting
and
joyful
things
but
he
understood
her
not
and
still
gazed
about
him
with
dazzled
eyes
for
his
face
was
still
towards
the
darkness
and
fear
was
upon
him
lest
this
place
should
prove
no
more
than
a
delusion
and
the
darkness
return
and
the
anguish
and
pain
then
he
who
had
been
her
guide
and
told
her
his
tale
came
forward
and
stood
by
the
side
of
the
newly
come
and
he
said
upon
me
for
you
know
me
and
know
from
whence
i
come
the
stranger
looked
dimly
with
his
heavy
eyes
and
he
replied
is
as
a
dream
that
i
know
you
and
know
from
whence
you
came
and
the
dream
is
sweet
to
lie
here
and
think
that
i
am
at
peace
deceive
me
not
oh
deceive
me
not
with
dreams
that
are
sweet
but
let
me
go
upon
my
way
and
find
the
end
if
there
is
any
end
or
if
any
good
can
be
shall
we
do
cried
the
little
pilgrim
persuade
him
that
he
has
arrived
and
is
safe
and
dreams
no
more
and
they
stood
round
him
wondering
and
troubled
to
find
how
little
they
could
do
for
him
and
that
the
light
entered
so
slowly
into
his
soul
and
he
lay
on
the
bank
like
one
left
for
death
so
weary
and
so
worn
with
all
the
horrors
of
the
way
that
his
heart
was
faint
within
him
and
peace
itself
seemed
to
him
but
an
illusion
he
lay
silent
while
they
watched
and
waited
then
turned
himself
upon
the
grass
which
was
as
soft
to
the
weary
wayfarer
as
angels
wings
and
then
the
sunshine
caught
his
eye
as
if
he
had
been
a
newborn
babe
awakened
to
the
light
he
put
out
his
hand
to
it
and
touched
the
ground
that
was
golden
with
those
heavenly
rays
and
gathered
himself
up
till
he
felt
it
upon
his
face
and
opened
wide
his
dazzled
eyes
then
shaded
them
with
trembling
hands
and
said
to
himself
is
the
sun
it
is
the
sun
but
still
he
did
not
dare
to
believe
that
the
danger
and
the
toil
were
over
nor
could
he
listen
nor
understand
what
the
brethren
said
while
they
all
stood
around
and
watched
and
waited
wondering
each
how
the
should
be
satisfied
there
suddenly
arose
a
sound
with
which
they
were
all
acquainted
the
sound
of
one
approaching
the
faces
of
the
blessed
were
all
around
like
the
stars
in
the
sky
multitudes
whom
none
could
count
or
reckon
but
he
who
came
was
seen
of
none
save
him
to
whom
he
came
the
weary
man
rose
up
with
a
great
cry
then
fell
again
upon
his
knees
and
flung
his
arms
wide
in
the
wonder
and
the
joy
and
he
cried
it
thou
lord
it
was
thou
thine
was
the
face
and
thou
hast
brought
me
here
the
watchers
knew
not
what
the
other
voice
said
for
what
is
said
to
each
is
the
secret
of
the
lord
but
when
they
looked
again
the
man
stood
upright
upon
his
feet
and
his
face
was
full
of
light
and
though
he
trembled
with
weakness
and
with
weariness
and
with
exceeding
joy
yet
the
confusion
and
the
fear
were
gone
from
him
and
he
had
no
longer
any
suspicion
of
them
as
if
they
might
betray
him
but
held
out
his
trembling
hands
and
cried
you
are
friends
and
you
spoke
to
me
and
called
me
brother
and
am
i
here
and
am
i
here
for
to
name
the
name
of
that
blessed
country
was
not
needful
any
longer
now
that
he
had
seen
the
lord
then
a
great
band
and
guard
of
honor
of
angels
and
principalities
and
powers
surrounded
him
and
led
him
away
to
the
holy
city
and
to
the
presence
of
the
father
who
had
permitted
and
had
not
forbidden
what
the
lord
had
done
and
all
the
companies
of
the
blessed
followed
after
with
wonder
and
gladness
and
triumph
because
the
great
love
of
the
lord
had
drawn
out
of
the
darkness
even
those
who
were
beyond
hope
the
little
pilgrim
saw
them
depart
from
her
with
love
and
joy
and
sat
down
upon
the
rocky
edge
and
sang
her
own
song
of
peace
for
her
fear
was
gone
and
she
was
ready
to
do
her
service
there
upon
the
verge
of
the
precipice
as
among
the
flowers
and
the
sunshine
where
her
own
place
was
the
depths
she
said
come
they
come
from
the
land
of
darkness
where
no
love
is
for
thy
love
o
lord
is
more
than
the
darkness
and
the
depths
and
where
hope
is
not
there
thy
pity
goes
she
sat
and
sang
to
herself
like
a
happy
child
for
her
heart
had
fathomed
the
awful
gloom
which
baffles
angels
and
men
and
she
had
learned
that
though
hope
comes
to
an
end
and
light
fails
and
the
feet
of
the
ambassadors
are
stayed
on
the
mountains
and
the
voice
of
the
pleaders
is
silenced
and
darkness
swallows
up
the
world
yet
love
never
fails
as
she
sang
the
pity
in
her
heart
grew
so
strong
and
her
desire
to
help
the
lost
that
she
rose
up
and
stepped
forth
into
the
awful
gloom
and
had
it
been
permitted
in
her
gentleness
and
weakness
would
have
gone
forth
to
the
deeps
and
had
no
fear
the
ground
gave
way
under
her
feet
so
dreadful
was
the
precipice
but
though
her
heart
beat
with
the
horror
of
it
and
the
whirl
of
the
descent
and
the
darkness
which
blinded
her
eyes
yet
had
she
no
hurt
and
when
her
foot
touched
the
rock
and
that
sinking
sense
of
emptiness
and
vacancy
ceased
she
looked
around
and
saw
the
path
by
which
that
traveller
had
come
for
when
the
eyes
are
used
to
the
darkness
the
horror
of
the
gloom
was
no
longer
like
a
solid
thing
but
moved
into
shades
of
darker
and
less
dark
so
that
she
saw
where
the
rocks
stood
and
how
they
sank
with
edges
that
cut
like
swords
down
and
ever
down
into
the
abysses
and
how
here
a
deep
ravine
was
rent
between
them
and
there
were
breaks
and
scars
as
though
some
one
had
caught
the
jagged
points
with
wounded
hand
or
foot
struggling
up
the
perpendicular
surface
towards
the
little
ray
of
light
like
a
tiny
star
which
shone
as
on
immeasurable
heights
to
show
where
life
was
as
she
travelled
deeper
and
deeper
it
was
a
wonder
to
see
how
far
that
little
ray
penetrated
down
and
down
through
gulfs
of
darkness
blue
and
cold
like
the
shimmer
of
a
diamond
and
even
when
it
could
be
seen
no
more
sent
yet
a
shadowy
refraction
a
line
of
something
less
black
than
the
darkness
a
lightening
amid
the
gloom
a
something
indefinable
which
was
hope
the
rocks
were
more
cruel
than
imagination
could
conceive
sometimes
pointed
and
sharp
like
knives
sometimes
smooth
and
upright
as
a
wall
with
no
hold
for
the
climber
sometimes
moving
under
the
touch
with
stones
that
rolled
and
crushed
the
bleeding
feet
and
though
the
solid
masses
were
distinguishable
from
the
lighter
darkness
of
the
air
yet
it
could
only
be
in
groping
that
the
travellers
by
that
way
could
find
where
any
foothold
was
the
traveller
who
came
from
above
and
who
had
the
privilege
of
her
happiness
sank
down
as
if
borne
on
wings
yet
needed
all
her
courage
not
to
be
afraid
of
the
awful
rocks
that
rose
all
above
and
around
her
perpendicular
in
the
gloom
and
the
great
blast
of
an
icy
wind
swept
upwards
like
something
flying
upon
great
wings
so
tremendous
was
the
force
of
it
whirling
from
the
depths
below
sucked
upwards
by
the
very
warmth
of
the
life
above
so
that
the
little
pilgrim
herself
caught
at
the
rocks
that
she
might
not
be
swept
again
towards
the
top
or
dashed
against
the
stony
pinnacles
that
stood
up
on
every
side
she
was
glad
when
she
found
a
little
platform
under
her
feet
for
a
moment
where
she
could
rest
and
also
because
she
had
come
not
from
curiosity
to
see
that
gulf
but
with
the
hope
and
desire
to
meet
some
one
to
whom
she
could
be
of
a
little
comfort
or
help
in
the
terrors
of
the
way
while
she
stood
for
a
moment
to
get
her
breath
she
became
sensible
that
some
living
thing
was
near
and
putting
out
her
hand
she
felt
that
there
was
round
her
something
that
was
like
a
bastion
upon
a
fortified
wall
and
immediately
a
hand
touched
hers
and
a
soft
voice
said
fear
not
for
this
is
the
and
i
am
one
of
those
who
keep
the
way
she
had
started
and
trembled
indeed
not
that
she
feared
but
because
the
delicate
fabric
of
her
being
was
such
that
every
movement
of
the
wind
and
even
those
that
were
instinctive
and
belonged
to
the
habits
of
another
life
betrayed
themselves
in
her
and
she
said
knew
not
that
there
were
any
or
any
one
to
help
but
came
because
my
heart
called
me
if
perhaps
i
might
hold
out
my
hand
in
the
darkness
and
be
of
use
where
there
was
no
light
and
stand
by
me
said
the
watcher
and
the
little
pilgrim
saw
that
there
was
a
whiteness
near
to
her
out
of
which
slowly
shaped
the
face
of
a
fair
and
tender
woman
whom
she
knew
not
but
loved
and
though
they
could
scarcely
see
each
other
yet
they
knew
each
other
for
sisters
and
kissed
and
took
comfort
together
holding
each
other
hands
in
the
midst
of
the
awful
gloom
and
the
little
pilgrim
questioned
in
low
and
hushed
tones
it
to
help
that
you
are
here
help
when
that
may
be
but
rather
to
watch
and
to
send
the
news
and
make
it
known
that
one
is
coming
that
the
bells
of
joy
may
be
sounded
and
all
the
blessed
may
rejoice
said
the
little
pilgrim
me
your
name
that
i
may
do
you
honor
for
to
gain
such
high
promotion
can
be
given
only
to
the
great
who
are
made
perfect
and
to
those
who
love
most
am
not
great
said
the
watcher
the
lord
who
considers
all
has
placed
me
here
that
i
may
be
the
first
to
see
when
one
comes
who
is
in
the
dark
places
below
and
also
because
there
are
some
who
say
that
love
is
idolatry
and
that
the
father
will
not
have
us
long
for
our
own
therefore
am
i
permitted
to
wait
and
watch
and
think
the
time
not
long
for
the
love
i
bear
him
for
he
is
mine
and
when
he
comes
i
will
ascend
with
him
to
the
dear
country
of
the
light
and
some
other
who
loves
enough
will
be
promoted
in
my
place
am
not
worthy
said
the
little
pilgrim
is
a
great
promotion
but
oh
that
we
might
be
permitted
to
help
to
put
out
a
hand
or
to
clear
the
way
my
little
sister
said
the
watcher
patience
must
have
its
perfect
work
and
for
those
who
are
coming
help
is
secret
they
must
not
see
it
nor
know
it
for
the
land
of
darkness
is
beyond
hope
the
father
will
not
force
the
will
of
any
creature
he
has
made
for
he
respects
us
in
our
nature
which
is
his
image
and
when
a
man
will
not
and
will
not
till
the
day
is
over
what
can
be
done
for
him
he
is
left
to
his
will
and
is
permitted
to
do
it
as
it
seems
good
in
his
eyes
a
man
will
is
great
for
it
is
the
gift
of
god
but
the
lord
who
can
not
rest
while
one
is
miserable
still
goes
secretly
to
them
for
his
heart
yearns
after
them
and
by
times
they
will
see
his
face
or
some
thought
of
old
will
seize
upon
them
and
some
will
say
to
perish
upon
the
dark
mountains
is
better
than
to
live
here
and
i
have
seen
said
the
watcher
the
lord
will
go
with
them
all
the
way
but
secretly
so
that
they
can
not
see
him
and
though
it
grieves
his
heart
not
to
help
yet
will
he
not
for
they
have
become
the
creatures
of
their
own
will
and
by
that
must
they
attain
she
put
out
her
hand
to
the
and
drew
her
to
the
side
of
the
rocky
wall
so
that
they
felt
the
sweep
of
the
wind
in
their
faces
but
were
not
driven
before
it
come
she
said
two
of
us
together
will
be
like
a
great
light
to
those
who
are
in
the
darkness
they
will
see
us
like
a
lamp
and
it
will
cheer
them
though
they
know
not
why
we
are
here
listen
she
cried
and
the
little
pilgrim
holding
fast
the
hand
of
the
watcher
listened
and
looked
down
upon
the
awful
way
and
underneath
the
sweep
of
the
icy
wind
was
a
small
sharp
sound
as
of
a
stone
rolling
or
a
needle
of
rock
that
broke
and
fell
like
the
sounds
that
are
in
a
wood
when
some
creature
moves
though
too
far
off
for
footstep
to
sound
said
the
watcher
and
her
face
so
shone
with
joy
that
the
little
pilgrim
saw
it
clearly
like
the
shining
of
the
morning
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
comes
sister
she
cried
it
he
whom
you
love
above
all
the
rest
is
it
he
the
watcher
smiled
and
said
it
is
not
he
yet
is
it
a
brother
if
it
is
not
he
now
yet
his
time
will
come
and
in
every
one
who
passes
i
hope
to
see
his
face
and
the
more
that
come
the
more
certain
it
is
that
he
will
come
and
the
time
seems
not
long
for
the
love
i
bear
him
and
it
is
for
this
that
the
lord
has
so
considered
me
listen
for
some
one
comes
and
there
came
to
these
watchers
the
strangest
sight
for
there
flew
past
them
while
they
gazed
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
carried
upon
the
sweep
of
the
wind
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
they
could
see
the
faint
white
in
his
face
with
eyes
of
flame
and
lips
set
firm
whirled
forward
upon
the
wind
which
would
have
dashed
him
against
the
rocks
but
as
he
whirled
past
he
caught
with
his
hand
the
needles
of
the
opposite
peaks
and
was
swung
high
over
a
great
chasm
and
landed
upon
a
higher
height
high
over
their
heads
and
for
a
moment
they
could
hear
like
a
pulsation
through
the
depths
the
hard
panting
of
his
breath
then
with
scarcely
a
moment
for
rest
they
heard
the
sound
of
his
progress
onward
as
if
he
did
battle
with
the
mountain
and
his
own
swiftness
carried
him
like
another
wind
it
had
taken
less
than
a
moment
to
sweep
him
past
quicker
than
the
flight
of
a
bird
as
sudden
as
a
lightning
flash
the
little
pilgrim
followed
him
with
her
eager
ears
wondering
if
he
would
leap
thus
into
the
country
of
light
and
take
heaven
by
storm
or
whether
he
would
fall
upon
the
heavenly
hills
and
lie
prostrate
in
weariness
and
exhaustion
like
him
to
whom
she
had
ministered
she
followed
him
with
her
ears
for
the
sound
of
his
progress
was
with
crashing
of
rocks
and
a
swift
movement
in
the
air
but
she
was
called
back
by
the
pressure
of
the
hand
of
the
watcher
who
did
not
like
the
little
pilgrim
follow
him
who
thus
rushed
through
space
as
far
as
there
was
sound
or
sight
of
him
but
had
turned
again
to
the
lower
side
and
was
gazing
once
more
and
listening
for
the
little
noises
in
the
gulf
below
the
little
pilgrim
remembered
her
friend
hope
and
said
softly
was
not
he
and
the
watcher
clasped
her
hand
again
and
answered
was
a
dear
brother
i
have
sounded
the
silver
bells
for
him
and
soon
we
shall
hear
them
answering
from
the
heights
above
and
another
time
it
will
be
he
and
they
kissed
each
other
because
they
understood
each
the
other
in
her
heart
and
then
they
talked
together
of
the
old
life
when
all
things
began
and
of
the
wonderful
things
they
had
learned
concerning
the
love
of
the
father
and
the
son
and
how
all
the
world
was
held
by
them
and
penetrated
through
and
through
by
threads
of
love
so
that
it
could
never
fail
and
the
darkness
seemed
light
round
them
and
they
forgot
for
a
little
that
the
wind
was
not
as
a
summer
breeze
then
once
more
the
hand
of
the
watcher
pressed
that
of
her
companion
and
bade
her
hush
and
listen
and
they
sat
together
holding
their
breath
straining
their
ears
then
heard
they
faint
sounds
which
were
very
different
from
those
made
by
him
who
had
been
driven
past
them
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
first
as
of
something
falling
but
very
far
away
and
a
faint
sound
as
of
a
foot
which
slipped
the
listeners
did
not
say
a
word
to
each
other
they
sat
still
and
listened
scarcely
drawing
their
breath
the
darkness
had
no
voice
it
could
not
be
but
that
some
traveller
was
there
though
hidden
deep
deep
in
the
gloom
only
betrayed
by
the
sound
there
was
a
long
pause
and
the
watcher
held
fast
the
little
pilgrim
hand
and
betrayed
to
her
the
longing
in
her
heart
for
though
she
was
already
blessed
beyond
all
blessedness
known
on
earth
yet
had
she
not
forgotten
the
love
that
had
begun
on
earth
but
was
forevermore
she
murmured
to
herself
and
said
it
is
not
he
it
is
a
brother
and
the
more
that
come
the
more
sure
it
is
that
he
will
come
little
sister
is
there
one
for
whom
you
watch
is
no
one
the
pilgrim
said
all
so
care
i
for
all
cried
the
watcher
and
she
drew
her
companion
with
her
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
and
they
sat
down
upon
it
low
among
the
rocks
to
escape
the
rushing
of
the
wind
and
they
sang
together
a
soft
song
if
he
should
hear
us
she
said
may
give
him
courage
and
there
they
sat
and
sang
and
the
white
of
their
garments
and
of
their
heavenly
faces
showed
like
a
light
in
the
deep
gloom
so
that
he
who
was
toiling
upwards
might
see
that
speck
above
him
and
be
encouraged
to
continue
upon
his
way
sometimes
he
fell
and
they
could
hear
the
moan
he
made
for
every
sound
came
upwards
however
small
and
faint
it
might
be
and
sometimes
dragged
himself
along
so
that
they
heard
his
movement
up
some
shelf
of
rock
and
as
the
pilgrim
looked
she
saw
other
and
other
dim
whitenesses
along
the
ravines
of
the
dark
mountains
and
knew
that
she
was
not
the
only
one
but
that
many
had
come
to
watch
and
look
for
the
coming
of
those
who
had
been
lost
time
was
as
nothing
to
these
heavenly
watchers
but
they
knew
how
long
and
terrible
were
the
moments
to
those
upon
the
way
sometimes
there
would
be
silence
like
the
silence
of
long
years
and
fear
came
upon
them
that
the
wayfarer
had
turned
back
or
that
he
had
fallen
and
lay
suffering
at
the
bottom
of
some
gulf
or
had
been
swept
by
the
wind
upon
some
icy
peak
and
dashed
against
the
rocks
then
anon
while
they
listened
and
held
their
breath
a
little
sound
would
strike
again
into
the
silence
bringing
back
hope
and
again
and
again
all
would
be
still
the
little
pilgrim
held
her
companion
hand
and
the
thought
went
through
her
mind
that
were
she
watching
for
one
whom
she
loved
above
the
rest
her
heart
would
fail
but
the
watcher
answered
her
as
if
she
had
spoken
and
said
no
oh
no
for
if
it
is
not
he
it
is
a
brother
and
the
lord
give
them
joy
but
they
sang
no
more
their
hearts
being
faint
with
suspense
and
with
eagerness
to
hear
every
sound
then
in
the
great
chill
of
the
silence
suddenly
and
not
far
off
came
the
sound
of
one
who
spoke
he
murmured
to
himself
and
said
can
continue
on
this
terrible
way
the
night
is
black
like
hell
and
there
comes
no
morning
it
was
better
in
the
land
of
darkness
for
still
we
could
see
the
face
of
man
though
not
god
the
muffled
voice
shook
at
that
word
and
then
was
still
suddenly
as
though
it
had
been
a
flame
and
the
wind
had
blown
it
out
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
until
suddenly
it
broke
forth
once
more
is
this
that
has
come
to
me
that
i
can
say
the
name
of
god
it
tortures
no
longer
it
is
as
balm
but
he
is
far
off
and
hears
nothing
he
called
us
and
we
answered
not
now
it
is
we
who
call
and
he
will
not
hear
i
will
lie
down
and
die
it
can
not
be
that
a
man
must
live
and
live
forever
in
pain
and
anguish
here
will
i
lie
and
it
will
end
o
thou
whose
face
i
have
seen
in
the
night
make
it
possible
for
a
man
to
die
the
watcher
loosed
herself
from
her
companion
clasp
and
stood
upright
upon
the
edge
of
the
cliff
clasping
her
hands
together
and
saying
low
as
to
herself
father
as
one
who
can
not
refrain
from
that
appeal
but
who
knows
the
father
loves
best
and
that
to
intercede
is
vain
and
longing
was
in
her
face
and
joy
for
it
was
he
and
she
knew
that
he
could
not
now
fail
but
would
reach
to
the
celestial
country
and
to
the
shining
of
the
sun
yet
that
it
was
not
hers
to
help
him
nor
any
man
nor
angel
but
the
little
pilgrim
was
ignorant
not
having
been
taught
and
she
committed
herself
to
those
depths
though
she
feared
them
and
though
she
knew
not
what
she
could
do
and
once
more
the
dense
air
closed
over
her
and
the
vacancy
swallowed
her
up
and
when
she
reached
the
rocks
below
there
lay
something
at
her
feet
which
she
felt
to
be
a
man
but
she
could
not
see
him
nor
touch
him
and
when
she
tried
to
speak
her
voice
died
away
in
her
throat
and
made
no
sound
whether
it
was
the
wind
that
caught
it
and
swept
it
quite
away
or
that
the
well
of
that
depth
profound
sucked
every
note
upwards
or
whether
because
it
was
not
permitted
that
either
man
or
angel
should
come
out
of
their
sphere
or
help
be
given
which
was
forbidden
the
little
pilgrim
knew
not
for
never
had
it
been
said
to
her
that
she
should
stand
aside
where
need
was
and
surprise
which
was
stronger
than
the
icy
wind
and
for
a
moment
a
great
dismay
took
hold
upon
her
for
she
understood
not
how
it
was
that
the
bond
of
silence
should
bind
her
and
that
she
should
be
unable
to
put
forth
her
hand
to
help
him
whom
she
heard
moaning
and
murmuring
but
could
not
see
and
scarcely
could
her
feet
keep
hold
of
the
awful
rock
or
her
form
resist
the
upward
sweep
of
the
wind
but
though
he
saw
her
not
nor
she
him
yet
could
not
she
leave
him
in
his
weakness
and
misery
saying
to
herself
that
even
if
she
could
do
nothing
it
must
be
well
that
a
little
love
should
be
near
then
she
heard
him
speak
again
crouching
under
the
rock
at
her
feet
and
he
said
faintly
to
himself
was
no
dream
in
the
land
of
darkness
there
are
no
dreams
nor
voices
that
speak
within
us
on
the
earth
they
were
never
silent
struggling
and
crying
but
there
all
blank
and
still
therefore
it
was
no
dream
it
was
one
who
came
and
looked
me
in
the
face
and
love
was
in
his
eyes
i
have
not
seen
love
oh
for
so
long
but
it
was
no
dream
if
god
is
a
dream
i
know
not
but
love
i
know
and
he
said
to
me
arise
and
go
but
to
whom
must
i
go
the
words
are
words
that
once
i
knew
and
the
face
i
knew
but
to
whom
to
whom
the
little
pilgrim
cried
aloud
so
that
she
thought
the
rocks
must
be
rent
by
the
vehemence
of
her
cry
calling
like
the
other
father
father
as
if
her
heart
would
burst
and
it
was
like
despair
to
think
that
she
made
no
sound
and
that
the
brother
could
not
hear
her
who
lay
thus
fainting
at
her
feet
yet
she
could
not
stop
but
went
on
crying
like
a
child
that
has
lost
its
way
for
to
whom
could
a
child
call
but
to
her
father
and
all
the
more
when
she
can
not
understand
and
she
called
out
and
said
that
god
was
not
his
name
save
to
strangers
if
there
are
any
strangers
but
that
his
name
was
father
and
it
was
to
him
that
all
must
go
and
all
her
being
thrilled
like
a
bird
with
its
song
so
that
the
very
air
stirred
yet
no
voice
came
and
she
lifted
up
her
face
to
the
watcher
above
and
beheld
where
she
stood
holding
up
her
hands
a
little
whiteness
in
the
great
dark
but
though
these
two
were
calling
and
calling
the
silence
was
dumb
and
neither
of
them
could
take
him
by
the
hand
nor
lift
him
up
nor
show
him
far
far
above
the
little
diamond
of
the
light
but
were
constrained
to
stand
still
and
watch
seeing
that
he
was
one
of
those
who
are
beyond
hope
after
she
had
waited
a
long
time
he
stirred
again
in
the
dark
and
murmured
to
himself
once
more
saying
low
have
slept
and
am
strong
and
while
i
was
sleeping
he
has
come
again
he
has
looked
at
me
again
and
somewhere
i
will
find
him
i
will
arise
and
go
i
will
arise
and
go
and
she
heard
him
move
at
her
feet
and
grope
over
the
rock
with
his
hands
but
it
was
smooth
as
snow
with
no
holding
and
slippery
as
ice
and
the
watcher
stood
above
and
the
pilgrim
below
but
could
not
help
him
he
groped
and
groped
and
murmured
to
himself
ever
saying
will
arise
and
go
and
their
hearts
were
wrung
that
they
could
not
speak
to
him
nor
touch
him
nor
help
him
but
at
last
in
the
dark
there
burst
forth
a
great
cry
said
it
and
then
a
sound
of
weeping
and
amid
the
weeping
words
when
i
was
a
child
as
when
hope
was
i
will
arise
and
i
will
go
to
my
father
to
my
father
for
now
i
remember
and
i
know
the
little
pilgrim
sank
down
into
a
crevice
of
the
rocks
in
the
weakness
of
her
great
joy
and
something
passed
her
mounting
up
and
up
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
touched
her
shoulder
or
her
hand
unawares
and
that
the
dumb
cry
in
her
heart
had
reached
him
and
that
it
had
been
good
for
him
that
a
little
love
stood
by
though
only
to
watch
and
to
weep
and
she
listened
and
heard
him
go
on
and
on
and
she
herself
ascended
higher
to
the
and
the
watcher
was
gone
who
had
waited
there
for
her
beloved
for
she
had
gone
with
him
as
the
lord
had
promised
her
to
be
the
one
who
should
lead
him
to
the
holy
city
and
to
see
the
father
face
and
it
was
given
to
the
little
pilgrim
to
sound
the
silver
bells
and
to
warn
all
the
bands
of
the
blessed
and
the
great
angels
and
lords
of
the
whole
world
that
from
out
the
land
of
darkness
and
from
the
regions
beyond
hope
another
had
come
she
remained
not
there
long
because
there
were
many
who
sought
that
place
that
they
might
be
the
first
to
see
if
one
beloved
was
among
the
travellers
by
that
terrible
way
and
to
welcome
the
brother
or
sister
who
was
the
most
dear
to
them
of
all
the
children
of
the
father
but
it
was
thus
that
she
learned
the
last
lesson
of
all
that
is
in
heaven
and
that
is
in
earth
and
in
the
heights
above
and
in
the
depths
below
which
the
great
angels
desire
to
look
into
and
all
the
princes
and
powers
and
it
is
this
that
there
is
that
which
is
beyond
hope
yet
not
beyond
love
and
that
hope
may
fail
and
be
no
longer
possible
but
love
can
not
fail
for
hope
is
of
men
but
love
is
the
lord
and
there
is
but
one
thing
which
to
him
is
not
possible
which
is
to
forget
and
that
even
when
the
father
has
hidden
his
face
and
help
is
forbidden
yet
there
goes
he
secretly
and
can
not
forbear
but
if
there
were
any
deep
more
profound
and
to
which
access
was
not
either
from
the
dark
mountains
or
by
any
other
way
the
pilgrim
was
not
taught
nor
ever
found
any
knowledge
either
among
the
angels
who
know
all
things
or
among
her
brothers
who
were
the
children
of
men
iii
the
land
of
darkness
i
found
myself
standing
on
my
feet
with
the
tingling
sensation
of
having
come
down
rapidly
upon
the
ground
from
a
height
there
was
a
similar
feeling
in
my
head
as
of
the
whirling
and
sickening
sensation
of
passing
downwards
through
the
air
like
the
description
dante
gives
of
his
descent
upon
geryon
my
mind
curiously
enough
was
sufficiently
disengaged
to
think
of
that
or
at
least
to
allow
swift
passage
for
the
recollection
through
my
thoughts
all
the
aching
of
wonder
doubt
and
fear
which
i
had
been
conscious
of
a
little
while
before
was
gone
there
was
no
distinct
interval
between
the
one
condition
and
the
other
nor
in
my
fall
as
i
supposed
it
must
have
been
had
i
any
consciousness
of
change
there
was
the
whirling
of
the
air
resisting
my
passage
yet
giving
way
under
me
in
giddy
circles
and
then
the
sharp
shock
of
once
more
feeling
under
my
feet
something
solid
which
struck
yet
sustained
after
a
little
while
the
giddiness
above
and
the
tingling
below
passed
away
and
i
felt
able
to
look
about
me
and
discern
where
i
was
but
not
all
at
once
the
things
immediately
about
me
impressed
me
first
then
the
general
aspect
of
the
new
place
first
of
all
the
light
which
was
lurid
as
if
a
were
coming
on
i
looked
up
involuntarily
to
see
if
it
had
begun
to
rain
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
though
what
i
saw
above
me
was
a
lowering
canopy
of
cloud
dark
threatening
with
a
faint
reddish
tint
diffused
upon
the
vaporous
darkness
it
was
however
quite
sufficiently
clear
to
see
everything
and
there
was
a
good
deal
to
see
i
was
in
a
street
of
what
seemed
a
great
and
very
populous
place
there
were
shops
on
either
side
full
apparently
of
all
sorts
of
costly
wares
there
was
a
continual
current
of
passengers
up
and
down
on
both
sides
of
the
way
and
in
the
middle
of
the
street
carriages
of
every
description
humble
and
splendid
the
noise
was
great
and
ceaseless
the
traffic
continual
some
of
the
shops
were
most
brilliantly
lighted
attracting
one
eyes
in
the
sombre
light
outside
which
however
had
just
enough
of
day
in
it
to
make
these
spots
of
illumination
look
sickly
most
of
the
places
thus
distinguished
were
apparently
bright
with
the
electric
or
some
other
scientific
light
and
delicate
machines
of
every
description
brought
to
the
greatest
perfection
were
in
some
windows
as
were
also
many
fine
productions
of
art
but
mingled
with
the
gaudiest
and
coarsest
in
a
way
which
struck
me
with
astonishment
i
was
also
much
surprised
by
the
fact
that
the
traffic
which
was
never
stilled
for
a
moment
seemed
to
have
no
sort
of
regulation
some
carriages
dashed
along
upsetting
the
smaller
vehicles
in
their
way
without
the
least
restraint
or
order
either
as
it
seemed
from
their
own
good
sense
or
from
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
place
when
an
accident
happened
there
was
a
great
shouting
and
sometimes
a
furious
encounter
but
nobody
seemed
to
interfere
this
was
the
first
impression
made
upon
me
the
passengers
on
the
pavement
were
equally
regardless
i
was
myself
pushed
out
of
the
way
first
to
one
side
then
to
another
hustled
when
i
paused
for
a
moment
trodden
upon
and
driven
about
i
retreated
soon
to
the
doorway
of
a
shop
from
whence
with
a
little
more
safety
i
could
see
what
was
going
on
the
noise
made
my
head
ring
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
not
hear
myself
think
if
this
were
to
go
on
forever
i
said
to
myself
i
should
soon
go
mad
no
said
some
one
behind
me
at
all
you
will
get
used
to
it
you
will
be
glad
of
it
one
does
not
want
to
hear
one
thoughts
most
of
them
are
not
worth
hearing
i
turned
round
and
saw
it
was
the
master
of
the
shop
who
had
come
to
the
door
on
seeing
me
he
had
the
usual
smile
of
a
man
who
hoped
to
sell
his
wares
but
to
my
horror
and
astonishment
by
some
process
which
i
could
not
understand
i
saw
that
he
was
saying
to
himself
a
d
d
fool
here
another
of
those
cursed
wretches
d
him
all
with
the
same
smile
i
started
back
and
answered
him
as
hotly
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
a
d
d
fool
fool
yourself
and
all
the
rest
of
it
is
this
the
way
you
receive
strangers
here
he
said
with
the
same
smile
is
the
way
and
i
only
describe
you
as
you
are
as
you
will
soon
see
will
you
walk
in
and
look
over
my
shop
perhaps
you
will
find
something
to
suit
you
if
you
are
just
setting
up
as
i
suppose
i
looked
at
him
closely
but
this
time
i
could
not
see
that
he
was
saying
anything
beyond
what
was
expressed
by
his
lips
and
i
followed
him
into
the
shop
principally
because
it
was
quieter
than
the
street
and
without
any
intention
of
buying
for
what
should
i
buy
in
a
strange
place
where
i
had
no
settled
habitation
and
which
probably
i
was
only
passing
through
will
look
at
your
things
i
said
in
a
way
which
i
believe
i
had
of
perhaps
undue
pretension
i
had
never
been
or
of
very
elevated
station
but
i
was
believed
by
my
friends
or
enemies
to
have
an
inclination
to
make
myself
out
something
more
important
than
i
was
will
look
at
your
things
and
possibly
i
may
find
something
that
may
suit
me
but
with
all
the
of
paris
and
london
to
draw
from
it
is
scarcely
to
be
expected
that
in
a
place
like
this
here
i
stopped
to
draw
my
breath
with
a
good
deal
of
confusion
for
i
was
unwilling
to
let
him
see
that
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
place
like
this
said
the
with
a
little
laugh
which
seemed
to
me
full
of
mockery
supply
you
better
you
will
find
than
any
other
place
at
least
you
will
find
it
the
only
place
practicable
he
added
perceive
you
are
a
stranger
here
i
may
allow
myself
to
be
so
more
or
less
i
have
not
had
time
to
form
much
acquaintance
with
the
place
what
do
you
call
the
place
its
formal
name
i
mean
i
said
with
a
great
desire
to
keep
up
the
air
of
superior
information
except
for
the
first
moment
i
had
not
experienced
that
strange
power
of
looking
into
the
man
below
the
surface
which
had
frightened
me
now
there
occurred
another
gleam
of
insight
which
gave
me
once
more
a
sensation
of
alarm
i
seemed
to
see
a
light
of
hatred
and
contempt
below
his
smile
and
i
felt
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
taken
in
by
the
air
which
i
assumed
name
of
the
place
he
said
not
a
pretty
one
i
hear
the
gentlemen
who
come
to
my
shop
say
that
it
is
not
to
be
named
to
ears
polite
and
i
am
sure
your
ears
are
very
polite
he
said
this
with
the
most
offensive
laugh
and
i
turned
upon
him
and
answered
him
without
mincing
matters
with
a
plainness
of
speech
which
startled
myself
but
did
not
seem
to
move
him
for
he
only
laughed
again
you
not
afraid
i
said
i
will
leave
your
shop
and
never
enter
it
more
it
helps
to
pass
the
time
he
said
and
without
any
further
comment
began
to
show
me
very
elaborate
and
fine
articles
of
furniture
i
had
always
been
attracted
to
this
sort
of
thing
and
had
longed
to
buy
such
articles
for
my
house
when
i
had
one
but
never
had
it
in
my
power
now
i
had
no
house
nor
any
means
of
paying
so
far
as
i
knew
but
i
felt
quite
at
my
ease
about
buying
and
inquired
into
the
prices
with
the
greatest
composure
are
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
want
i
will
take
these
i
think
but
you
must
set
them
aside
for
me
for
i
do
not
at
the
present
moment
exactly
know
mean
you
have
got
no
rooms
to
put
them
in
said
the
master
of
the
shop
must
get
a
house
directly
that
all
if
you
only
up
to
it
it
is
easy
enough
look
about
until
you
find
something
you
like
and
then
take
possession
possession
i
was
so
much
surprised
that
i
stared
at
him
with
mingled
indignation
and
surprise
what
belongs
to
another
man
i
said
i
was
not
conscious
of
anything
ridiculous
in
my
look
i
was
indignant
which
is
not
a
state
of
mind
in
which
there
is
any
absurdity
but
the
suddenly
burst
into
a
storm
of
laughter
he
laughed
till
he
seemed
almost
to
fall
into
convulsions
with
a
harsh
mirth
which
reminded
me
of
the
old
image
of
the
crackling
of
thorns
and
had
neither
amusement
nor
warmth
in
it
and
presently
this
was
echoed
all
around
and
looking
up
i
saw
grinning
faces
full
of
derision
bent
upon
me
from
every
side
from
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
from
the
depths
of
the
shop
behind
faces
with
pens
behind
their
ears
faces
in
workmen
caps
all
distended
from
ear
to
ear
with
a
sneer
and
a
mock
and
a
rage
of
laughter
which
nearly
sent
me
mad
i
hurled
i
do
know
what
imprecations
at
them
as
i
rushed
out
stopping
my
ears
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
and
mortification
my
mind
was
so
distracted
by
this
occurrence
that
i
rushed
without
knowing
it
upon
some
one
who
was
passing
and
threw
him
down
with
the
violence
of
my
exit
upon
which
i
was
set
on
by
a
party
of
half
a
dozen
ruffians
apparently
his
companions
who
would
i
thought
kill
me
but
who
only
flung
me
wounded
bleeding
and
feeling
as
if
every
bone
in
my
body
had
been
broken
down
on
the
pavement
when
they
went
away
laughing
too
i
picked
myself
up
from
the
edge
of
the
causeway
aching
and
sore
from
head
to
foot
scarcely
able
to
move
yet
conscious
that
if
i
did
not
get
myself
out
of
the
way
one
or
other
of
the
vehicles
which
were
dashing
along
would
run
over
me
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
miserable
sensations
both
of
body
and
mind
with
which
i
dragged
myself
across
the
crowded
pavement
not
without
curses
and
even
kicks
from
the
and
avoiding
the
shop
from
which
i
still
heard
those
shrieks
of
devilish
laughter
gathered
myself
up
in
the
shelter
of
a
little
projection
of
a
wall
where
i
was
for
the
moment
safe
the
pain
which
i
felt
was
as
nothing
to
the
sense
of
humiliation
the
mortification
the
rage
with
which
i
was
possessed
there
is
nothing
in
existence
more
dreadful
than
rage
which
is
impotent
which
can
not
punish
or
avenge
which
has
to
restrain
itself
and
put
up
with
insults
showered
upon
it
i
had
never
known
before
what
that
helpless
hideous
exasperation
was
and
i
was
humiliated
beyond
description
brought
down
i
whose
inclination
it
was
to
make
more
of
myself
than
was
justifiable
to
the
aspect
of
a
miserable
ruffian
beaten
in
a
brawl
soiled
covered
with
mud
and
dust
my
clothes
torn
my
face
bruised
and
disfigured
all
this
within
half
an
hour
or
there
about
of
my
arrival
in
a
strange
place
where
nobody
knew
me
or
could
do
me
justice
i
kept
looking
out
feverishly
for
some
one
with
an
air
of
authority
to
whom
i
could
appeal
sooner
or
later
somebody
must
go
by
who
seeing
me
in
such
a
plight
must
inquire
how
it
came
about
must
help
me
and
vindicate
me
i
sat
there
for
i
can
not
tell
how
long
expecting
every
moment
that
were
it
but
a
policeman
somebody
would
notice
and
help
me
but
no
one
came
crowds
seemed
to
sweep
by
without
a
pause
all
hurrying
restless
some
with
anxious
faces
as
if
any
delay
would
be
mortal
some
in
noisy
groups
intercepting
the
passage
of
the
others
sometimes
one
would
pause
to
point
me
out
to
his
comrades
with
a
shout
of
derision
at
my
miserable
plight
or
if
by
a
change
of
posture
i
got
outside
the
protection
of
my
wall
would
kick
me
back
with
a
coarse
injunction
to
keep
out
of
the
way
no
one
was
sorry
for
me
not
a
look
of
compassion
not
a
word
of
inquiry
was
wasted
upon
me
no
representative
of
authority
appeared
i
saw
a
dozen
quarrels
while
i
lay
there
cries
of
the
weak
and
triumphant
shouts
of
the
strong
but
that
was
all
i
was
drawn
after
a
while
from
the
fierce
and
burning
sense
of
my
own
grievances
by
a
querulous
voice
quite
close
to
me
is
my
corner
it
said
sat
here
for
years
and
i
have
a
right
to
it
and
here
you
come
you
big
ruffian
because
you
know
i
have
got
the
strength
to
push
you
away
are
you
i
said
turning
round
for
close
beside
me
was
a
miserable
man
apparently
in
the
last
stage
of
disease
he
was
pale
as
death
yet
eaten
up
with
sores
his
body
was
agitated
by
a
nervous
trembling
he
seemed
to
shuffle
along
on
hands
and
feet
as
though
the
ordinary
mode
of
locomotion
was
impossible
to
him
and
yet
was
in
possession
of
all
his
limbs
pain
was
written
in
his
face
i
drew
away
to
leave
him
room
with
mingled
pity
and
horror
that
this
poor
wretch
should
be
the
partner
of
the
only
shelter
i
could
find
within
so
short
a
time
of
my
arrival
i
who
it
was
horrible
shameful
humiliating
and
yet
the
suffering
in
his
wretched
face
was
so
evident
that
i
could
not
but
feel
a
pang
of
pity
too
have
nowhere
to
go
i
said
am
a
stranger
i
have
been
badly
used
and
nobody
seems
to
care
he
said
cares
do
you
look
for
that
why
should
they
why
you
look
as
if
you
were
sorry
for
what
a
joke
he
murmured
to
himself
a
joke
sorry
for
some
one
else
what
a
fool
the
fellow
must
be
look
i
said
if
you
were
suffering
horribly
and
you
say
you
have
come
here
for
years
i
should
think
i
was
said
the
sick
man
what
is
that
to
you
yes
i
been
here
for
years
oh
years
that
means
nothing
for
longer
than
can
be
counted
suffering
is
not
the
word
torture
it
agony
but
who
cares
take
your
leg
out
of
my
way
i
drew
myself
out
of
his
way
from
a
sort
of
habit
though
against
my
will
and
asked
from
habit
too
you
never
any
better
than
now
he
looked
at
me
more
closely
and
an
air
of
astonishment
came
over
his
face
d
want
here
he
said
a
man
that
something
new
here
no
i
not
always
so
bad
if
you
want
to
know
i
get
better
and
then
i
go
and
do
what
makes
me
bad
again
and
that
how
it
will
go
on
and
i
choose
it
to
be
so
and
you
need
bring
any
of
your
d
d
pity
here
may
ask
at
least
why
are
you
looked
after
why
do
you
get
into
some
hospital
i
said
cried
the
sick
man
and
then
he
too
burst
out
into
that
furious
laugh
the
most
awful
sound
i
ever
had
heard
some
of
the
stopped
to
hear
what
the
joke
was
and
surrounded
me
with
once
more
a
circle
of
mockers
perhaps
you
would
like
a
whole
red
cross
society
with
ambulances
and
all
arranged
cried
one
the
shouted
another
i
sprang
up
to
my
feet
crying
not
with
an
impulse
of
rage
which
gave
me
strength
was
i
never
to
meet
with
anything
but
this
fiendish
laughter
some
authority
i
suppose
i
cried
in
my
fury
is
not
the
rabble
that
is
the
only
master
here
i
hope
but
nobody
took
the
least
trouble
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
for
myself
the
last
speaker
struck
me
on
the
mouth
and
called
me
an
accursed
fool
for
talking
of
what
i
did
not
understand
and
finally
they
all
swept
on
and
passed
away
i
had
been
as
i
thought
severely
injured
when
i
dragged
myself
into
that
corner
to
save
myself
from
the
crowd
but
i
sprang
up
now
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
me
my
wounds
had
disappeared
my
bruises
were
gone
i
was
as
i
had
been
when
i
dropped
giddy
and
amazed
upon
the
same
pavement
how
long
an
hour
before
it
might
have
been
an
hour
it
might
have
been
a
year
i
can
not
tell
the
light
was
the
same
as
ever
the
thunderous
atmosphere
unchanged
day
if
it
was
day
had
made
no
progress
night
if
it
was
evening
had
come
no
nearer
all
was
the
same
as
i
went
on
again
presently
with
a
vexed
and
angry
spirit
regarding
on
every
side
around
me
the
endless
surging
of
the
crowd
and
feeling
a
loneliness
a
sense
of
total
abandonment
and
solitude
which
i
can
not
describe
there
came
up
to
me
a
man
of
remarkable
appearance
that
he
was
a
person
of
importance
of
great
knowledge
and
information
could
not
be
doubted
he
was
very
pale
and
of
a
worn
but
commanding
aspect
the
lines
of
his
face
were
deeply
drawn
his
eyes
were
sunk
under
high
arched
brows
from
which
they
looked
out
as
from
caves
full
of
a
fiery
impatient
light
his
thin
lips
were
never
quite
without
a
smile
but
it
was
not
a
smile
in
which
any
pleasure
was
he
walked
slowly
not
hurrying
like
most
of
the
passengers
he
had
a
reflective
look
as
if
pondering
many
things
he
came
up
to
me
suddenly
without
introduction
or
preliminary
and
took
me
by
the
arm
object
had
you
in
talking
of
these
antiquated
institutions
he
said
and
i
saw
in
his
mind
the
gleam
of
the
thought
which
seemed
to
be
the
first
with
all
that
i
was
a
fool
and
that
it
was
the
natural
thing
to
wish
me
harm
just
as
in
the
earth
above
it
was
the
natural
thing
professed
at
least
to
wish
well
to
say
by
habit
and
without
thought
in
this
strange
country
the
stranger
was
received
with
a
curse
and
it
woke
an
answer
not
unlike
the
hasty
you
then
also
which
seemed
to
come
without
any
will
of
mine
through
my
mind
but
this
provoked
only
a
smile
from
my
new
friend
he
took
no
notice
he
was
disposed
to
examine
me
to
find
some
amusement
perhaps
how
could
i
tell
in
what
i
might
say
antiquated
things
you
still
so
slow
of
understanding
what
were
they
hospitals
the
pretences
of
a
world
that
can
still
deceive
itself
did
you
expect
to
find
them
here
expected
to
find
how
should
i
know
i
said
bewildered
shelter
for
a
poor
wretch
where
he
could
be
cared
for
not
to
be
left
there
to
die
in
the
street
expected
i
never
thought
i
took
it
for
granted
die
in
the
street
he
cried
with
a
smile
and
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
learn
better
by
and
by
and
if
he
did
die
in
the
street
what
then
what
is
that
to
you
me
i
turned
and
looked
at
him
amazed
but
he
had
somehow
shut
his
soul
so
that
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
deep
eyes
in
their
caves
and
the
smile
upon
the
mouth
more
to
me
than
to
any
one
i
only
spoke
for
humanity
sake
as
a
my
new
acquaintance
gave
way
to
a
silent
laugh
within
himself
which
was
not
so
offensive
as
the
loud
laugh
of
the
crowd
but
yet
was
more
exasperating
than
words
can
say
think
that
matters
but
it
does
not
hurt
you
that
he
should
he
in
pain
it
would
do
you
no
good
if
he
were
to
get
well
why
should
you
trouble
yourself
one
way
or
the
other
let
him
die
if
he
can
that
makes
no
difference
to
you
or
me
must
be
dull
indeed
i
cried
of
understanding
as
you
say
this
is
going
back
to
the
ideas
of
times
beyond
knowledge
before
christianity
as
soon
as
i
had
said
this
i
felt
somehow
i
could
not
tell
how
as
if
my
voice
jarred
as
if
something
false
and
unnatural
was
in
what
i
said
my
companion
gave
my
arm
a
twist
as
if
with
a
shock
of
surprise
then
laughed
in
his
inward
way
again
do
think
much
of
that
here
nor
of
your
modern
pretences
in
general
the
only
thing
that
touches
you
and
me
is
what
hurts
or
helps
ourselves
to
be
sure
it
all
comes
to
the
same
thing
for
i
suppose
it
annoys
you
to
see
that
wretch
writhing
it
hurts
your
more
delicate
consciousness
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
consciousness
i
cried
angrily
is
a
shame
to
let
a
suffer
if
we
can
prevent
it
should
he
suffer
said
my
companion
we
passed
as
he
spoke
some
other
squalid
wretched
creatures
shuffling
among
the
crowd
whom
he
kicked
with
his
foot
calling
forth
a
yell
of
pain
and
curses
this
he
regarded
with
a
supreme
contemptuous
calm
which
stupefied
me
nor
did
any
of
the
show
the
slightest
inclination
to
take
the
part
of
the
sufferers
they
laughed
or
shouted
out
a
gibe
or
what
was
still
more
wonderful
went
on
with
a
complete
unaffected
indifference
as
if
all
this
was
natural
i
tried
to
disengage
my
arm
in
horror
and
dismay
but
he
held
me
fast
with
a
pressure
that
hurt
me
the
question
he
said
have
we
to
do
with
it
your
fictitious
consciousness
makes
it
painful
to
you
to
me
on
the
contrary
who
take
the
view
of
nature
it
is
a
pleasurable
feeling
it
enhances
the
amount
of
ease
whatever
that
may
be
which
i
enjoy
i
am
in
no
pain
that
brute
who
is
and
he
flicked
with
a
stick
he
carried
the
uncovered
wound
of
a
wretch
upon
the
roadside
me
more
satisfied
with
my
condition
ah
you
think
it
is
i
who
am
the
brute
you
will
change
your
mind
by
and
by
i
cried
wrenching
my
arm
from
his
with
an
effort
i
should
live
a
hundred
years
hundred
years
a
drop
in
the
bucket
he
said
with
his
silent
laugh
will
live
forever
and
you
will
come
to
my
view
and
we
shall
meet
in
the
course
of
ages
from
time
to
time
to
compare
notes
i
would
say
after
the
old
fashion
but
you
are
but
newly
arrived
and
i
will
not
treat
you
so
badly
as
that
with
which
he
parted
from
me
waving
his
hand
with
his
everlasting
horrible
smile
i
said
to
myself
why
should
it
be
treating
me
badly
to
say
i
was
startled
by
a
buffet
on
the
mouth
that
cried
some
one
teach
you
how
to
wish
the
worst
of
tortures
to
people
who
have
done
you
no
harm
have
i
said
i
meant
no
harm
i
repeated
only
what
is
the
commonest
civility
the
merest
good
manners
wished
said
the
man
who
had
struck
me
wo
repeat
the
words
to
me
for
it
was
i
only
that
heard
them
the
awful
company
that
hurts
most
that
sets
everything
before
us
both
past
and
to
come
and
cuts
like
a
sword
and
burns
like
fire
i
say
it
to
yourself
and
see
how
it
feels
god
be
with
you
there
it
is
said
and
we
all
must
bear
it
thanks
you
fool
and
accursed
to
you
and
then
there
came
a
pause
over
all
the
place
an
awful
stillness
hundreds
of
men
and
women
standing
clutching
with
desperate
movements
at
their
hearts
as
if
to
tear
them
out
moving
their
heads
as
if
to
dash
them
against
the
wall
wringing
their
hands
with
a
look
upon
all
their
convulsed
faces
which
i
can
never
forget
they
all
turned
to
me
cursing
me
with
those
horrible
eyes
of
anguish
and
everything
was
still
the
noise
all
stopped
for
a
moment
the
air
all
silent
with
a
silence
that
could
be
felt
and
then
suddenly
out
of
the
crowd
there
came
a
great
piercing
cry
and
everything
began
again
exactly
as
before
while
this
pause
occurred
and
while
i
stood
wondering
bewildered
understanding
nothing
there
came
over
me
a
darkness
a
blackness
a
sense
of
misery
such
as
never
in
all
my
life
though
i
have
known
troubles
enough
i
had
felt
before
all
that
had
happened
to
me
throughout
my
existence
seemed
to
rise
pale
and
terrible
in
a
hundred
scenes
before
me
all
momentary
intense
as
if
each
was
the
present
moment
and
in
each
of
these
scenes
i
saw
what
i
had
never
seen
before
i
saw
where
i
had
taken
the
wrong
instead
of
the
right
step
in
what
wantonness
with
what
it
had
been
done
how
god
i
shuddered
at
the
name
had
spoken
and
called
me
and
even
entreated
and
i
had
withstood
and
refused
all
the
evil
i
had
done
came
back
and
spread
itself
out
before
my
eyes
and
i
loathed
it
yet
knew
that
i
had
chosen
it
and
that
it
would
be
with
me
forever
i
saw
it
all
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
in
a
moment
while
i
stood
there
and
all
men
with
me
in
the
horror
of
awful
thought
then
it
ceased
as
it
had
come
instantaneously
and
the
noise
and
the
laughter
and
the
quarrels
and
cries
and
all
the
commotion
of
this
new
bewildering
place
in
a
moment
began
again
i
had
seen
no
one
while
this
strange
paroxysm
lasted
when
it
disappeared
i
came
to
myself
emerging
as
from
a
dream
and
looked
into
the
face
of
the
man
whose
words
not
careless
like
mine
had
brought
it
upon
us
our
eyes
met
and
his
were
surrounded
by
curves
and
lines
of
anguish
which
were
terrible
to
see
he
said
with
a
short
laugh
which
was
forced
and
harsh
do
you
like
it
that
is
what
happens
when
if
it
came
often
who
could
endure
it
he
was
not
like
the
rest
there
was
no
sneer
upon
his
face
no
gibe
at
my
simplicity
even
now
when
all
had
recovered
he
was
still
quivering
with
something
that
looked
like
a
nobler
pain
his
face
was
very
grave
the
lines
deeply
drawn
in
it
and
he
seemed
to
be
seeking
no
amusement
or
distraction
nor
to
take
any
part
in
the
noise
and
tumult
which
was
going
on
around
you
know
what
that
cry
meant
he
said
you
hear
that
cry
it
was
some
one
who
saw
even
here
once
in
a
long
time
they
say
it
can
be
seen
can
be
seen
he
shook
his
head
looking
at
me
with
a
meaning
which
i
could
not
interpret
it
was
beyond
the
range
of
my
thoughts
i
came
to
know
after
or
i
never
could
have
made
this
record
but
on
that
subject
he
said
no
more
he
turned
the
way
i
was
going
though
it
mattered
nothing
what
way
i
went
for
all
were
the
same
to
me
are
one
of
the
he
said
have
not
been
long
here
me
i
cried
you
mean
by
where
are
we
how
can
one
tell
who
has
fallen
he
knows
not
whence
or
where
what
is
this
place
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
it
seems
to
me
that
i
hate
it
already
though
i
know
not
what
it
is
he
shook
his
head
once
more
will
hate
it
more
and
more
he
said
of
these
dreadful
streets
you
will
never
be
free
unless
and
here
he
stopped
again
what
if
it
is
possible
i
will
be
free
of
them
and
that
before
long
he
smiled
at
me
faintly
as
we
smile
at
children
but
not
with
derision
shall
you
do
that
between
this
miserable
world
and
all
others
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
it
is
full
of
all
the
bitterness
and
tears
that
come
from
all
the
universe
these
drop
from
them
but
stagnate
here
we
you
perceive
have
no
tears
not
even
at
moments
then
will
soon
be
accustomed
to
all
this
he
said
will
fall
into
the
way
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
amuse
yourself
to
make
it
passable
many
do
there
are
a
number
of
fine
things
to
be
seen
here
if
you
are
curious
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
or
work
there
is
even
work
there
is
only
one
thing
that
is
impossible
or
if
not
impossible
and
here
he
paused
again
and
raised
his
eyes
to
the
dark
clouds
and
lurid
sky
overhead
man
who
gave
that
cry
if
i
could
but
find
him
he
must
have
seen
could
he
see
i
asked
but
there
arose
in
my
mind
something
like
contempt
a
visionary
who
could
not
speak
plainly
who
broke
off
into
mysterious
inferences
and
appeared
to
know
more
than
he
would
say
it
seemed
foolish
to
waste
time
when
evidently
there
was
still
so
much
to
see
in
the
company
of
such
a
man
and
i
began
already
to
feel
more
at
home
there
was
something
in
that
moment
of
anguish
which
had
wrought
a
strange
familiarity
in
me
with
my
surroundings
it
was
so
great
a
relief
to
return
out
of
the
misery
of
that
sharp
and
horrible
to
what
had
come
to
be
in
comparison
easy
and
well
known
i
had
no
desire
to
go
back
and
grope
among
the
mysteries
and
anguish
so
suddenly
revealed
i
was
glad
to
be
free
from
them
to
be
left
to
myself
to
get
a
little
pleasure
perhaps
like
the
others
while
these
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
i
had
gone
on
without
any
active
impulse
of
my
own
as
everybody
else
did
and
my
latest
companion
had
disappeared
he
saw
no
doubt
without
any
need
for
words
what
my
feelings
were
and
i
proceeded
on
my
way
i
felt
better
as
i
got
more
accustomed
to
the
place
or
perhaps
it
was
the
sensation
of
relief
after
that
moment
of
indescribable
pain
as
for
the
sights
in
the
streets
i
began
to
grow
used
to
them
the
wretched
creatures
who
strolled
or
sat
about
with
signs
of
sickness
or
wounds
upon
them
disgusted
me
only
they
no
longer
called
forth
my
pity
i
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
my
silly
questions
about
the
hospital
all
the
same
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
to
have
had
some
receptacle
for
them
into
which
they
might
have
been
driven
out
of
the
way
i
felt
an
inclination
to
push
them
aside
as
i
saw
other
people
do
but
was
a
little
ashamed
of
that
impulse
too
and
so
i
went
on
there
seemed
no
quiet
streets
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
in
the
place
some
were
smaller
meaner
with
a
different
kind
of
passengers
but
the
same
hubbub
and
unresting
movement
everywhere
i
saw
no
signs
of
melancholy
or
seriousness
active
pain
violence
brutality
the
continual
shock
of
quarrels
and
blows
but
no
pensive
faces
about
no
sorrowfulness
nor
the
kind
of
trouble
which
brings
thought
everybody
was
fully
occupied
pushing
on
as
if
in
a
race
pausing
for
nothing
the
glitter
of
the
lights
the
shouts
and
sounds
of
continual
going
the
endless
whirl
of
confused
and
tired
me
after
a
while
i
went
as
far
out
as
i
could
go
to
what
seemed
the
of
the
place
where
i
could
by
glimpses
perceive
a
low
horizon
all
lurid
and
glowing
which
seemed
to
sweep
round
and
round
against
it
in
the
distance
stood
up
the
outline
black
against
that
red
glow
of
other
towers
and
so
many
and
great
that
there
was
evidently
another
town
between
us
and
the
sunset
if
sunset
it
was
i
have
seen
a
western
sky
like
it
when
there
were
storms
about
and
all
the
colors
of
the
sky
were
heightened
and
darkened
by
angry
influences
the
distant
town
rose
against
it
cutting
the
firmament
so
that
it
might
have
been
tongues
of
flame
flickering
between
the
dark
solid
outlines
and
across
the
waste
open
country
which
lay
between
the
two
cities
there
came
a
distant
hum
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
which
was
in
reality
the
roar
of
that
other
multitude
the
country
between
showed
no
greenness
or
beauty
it
lay
dark
under
the
dark
overhanging
sky
here
and
there
seemed
a
cluster
of
giant
trees
scathed
as
if
by
lightning
their
bare
boughs
standing
up
as
high
as
the
distant
towers
their
trunks
like
black
columns
without
foliage
openings
here
and
there
with
glimmering
lights
looked
like
the
mouths
of
mines
but
of
passengers
there
were
scarcely
any
a
figure
here
and
there
flew
along
as
if
pursued
imperfectly
seen
a
shadow
only
a
little
darker
than
the
space
about
and
in
contrast
with
the
sound
of
the
city
here
was
no
sound
at
all
except
the
low
roar
on
either
side
and
a
vague
cry
or
two
from
the
openings
of
the
mine
a
scene
all
drawn
in
darkness
in
variations
of
gloom
deriving
scarcely
any
light
at
all
from
the
red
and
gloomy
burning
of
that
distant
evening
sky
a
faint
curiosity
to
go
forwards
to
see
what
the
mines
were
perhaps
to
get
a
share
in
what
was
brought
up
from
them
crossed
my
mind
but
i
was
afraid
of
the
dark
of
the
wild
uninhabited
savage
look
of
the
landscape
though
when
i
thought
of
it
there
seemed
no
reason
why
a
narrow
stretch
of
country
between
two
great
towns
should
be
alarming
but
the
impression
was
strong
and
above
reason
i
turned
back
to
the
street
in
which
i
had
first
alighted
and
which
seemed
to
end
in
a
great
square
full
of
people
in
the
middle
there
was
a
stage
erected
from
which
some
one
was
delivering
an
oration
or
address
of
some
sort
he
stood
beside
a
long
table
upon
which
lay
something
which
i
could
not
clearly
distinguish
except
that
it
seemed
alive
and
moved
or
rather
writhed
with
convulsive
twitchings
as
if
trying
to
get
free
of
the
bonds
which
confined
it
round
the
stage
in
front
were
a
number
of
seats
occupied
by
listeners
many
of
whom
were
women
whose
interest
seemed
to
be
very
great
some
of
them
being
furnished
with
while
a
great
unsettled
crowd
coming
and
going
drifted
round
many
arrested
for
a
time
as
they
passed
proceeding
on
their
way
when
the
interest
flagged
as
is
usual
to
such
assemblies
i
followed
two
of
those
who
pushed
their
way
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
stage
and
who
were
strong
big
men
more
fitted
to
elbow
the
crowd
aside
than
i
after
my
rough
treatment
in
the
first
place
and
the
agitation
i
had
passed
through
could
be
i
was
glad
besides
to
take
advantage
of
the
explanation
which
one
was
giving
to
the
other
always
fun
to
see
this
fellow
demonstrate
he
said
the
subject
a
capital
one
let
get
well
forward
and
see
all
that
going
on
subject
do
you
mean
said
the
other
theme
or
the
example
and
they
both
laughed
though
i
did
not
seize
the
point
of
the
wit
both
said
the
first
speaker
theme
is
nerves
and
as
a
lesson
in
construction
and
the
calculation
of
possibilities
it
fine
he
very
clever
at
that
he
shows
how
they
are
all
strung
to
give
as
much
pain
and
do
as
much
harm
as
can
be
and
yet
how
well
it
all
managed
do
you
know
to
look
the
reverse
as
for
the
example
he
a
capital
one
all
nerves
together
lying
if
you
like
just
on
the
surface
ready
for
the
knife
they
on
the
surface
i
ca
see
where
the
fun
is
said
the
other
speaking
of
course
they
are
just
where
other
nerves
are
but
he
what
you
call
a
highly
organized
nervous
specimen
there
will
be
plenty
of
fun
hush
he
is
just
going
to
begin
arrangement
of
these
threads
of
being
said
the
lecturer
evidently
resuming
after
a
pause
as
to
convey
to
the
brain
the
most
instantaneous
messages
of
pain
or
pleasure
is
wonderfully
skilful
and
clever
i
need
not
say
to
the
audience
before
me
enlightened
as
it
is
by
experiences
of
the
most
striking
kind
that
the
messages
are
less
of
pleasure
than
of
pain
they
report
to
the
brain
the
stroke
of
injury
far
more
often
than
the
thrill
of
pleasure
though
sometimes
that
too
no
doubt
or
life
could
scarcely
be
maintained
the
powers
that
be
have
found
it
necessary
to
mingle
a
little
sweet
of
pleasurable
sensation
else
our
miserable
race
would
certainly
have
found
some
means
of
procuring
annihilation
i
do
not
for
a
moment
pretend
to
say
that
the
pleasure
is
sufficient
to
offer
a
just
counterbalance
to
the
other
none
of
my
hearers
will
i
hope
accuse
me
of
inconsistency
i
am
ready
to
allow
that
in
a
previous
condition
i
asserted
somewhat
strongly
that
this
was
the
case
but
experience
has
enlightened
us
on
that
point
our
circumstances
are
now
understood
by
us
all
in
a
manner
impossible
while
we
were
still
in
a
condition
of
incompleteness
we
are
all
convinced
that
there
is
no
compensation
the
pride
of
the
position
of
bearing
everything
rather
than
give
in
or
making
a
submission
we
do
not
feel
of
preserving
our
own
will
and
individuality
to
all
eternity
is
the
only
compensation
i
am
satisfied
with
it
for
my
part
the
orator
made
a
pause
holding
his
head
high
and
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
applause
the
two
men
before
me
cheered
vociferously
is
the
right
way
to
look
at
it
one
of
them
said
my
eyes
were
upon
them
with
no
particular
motive
and
i
could
not
help
starting
as
i
saw
suddenly
underneath
their
applause
and
laughter
a
snarl
of
cursing
which
was
the
real
expression
of
their
thoughts
i
felt
disposed
in
the
same
way
to
curse
the
speaker
though
i
knew
no
reason
why
he
went
on
a
little
farther
explaining
what
he
meant
to
do
and
then
turning
round
approached
the
table
an
assistant
who
was
waiting
uncovered
it
quickly
the
audience
stirred
with
quickened
interest
and
i
with
consternation
made
a
step
forwards
crying
out
with
horror
the
object
on
the
table
writhing
twitching
to
get
free
but
bound
down
by
every
limb
was
a
living
man
the
lecturer
went
forwards
calmly
taking
his
instruments
from
their
case
with
perfect
composure
and
coolness
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
and
inserted
the
knife
in
the
flesh
making
a
long
clear
cut
in
the
bound
arm
i
shrieked
out
unable
to
restrain
myself
the
sight
of
the
deliberate
wound
the
blood
the
cry
of
agony
that
came
from
the
victim
the
calmness
of
all
the
filled
me
with
horror
and
rage
indescribable
i
felt
myself
clear
the
crowd
away
with
a
rush
and
spring
on
the
platform
i
could
not
tell
how
devil
i
cried
the
man
go
where
is
the
police
where
is
a
magistrate
let
the
man
go
this
moment
fiends
in
human
shape
i
have
you
brought
to
justice
i
heard
myself
shouting
wildly
as
i
flung
myself
upon
the
wretched
sufferer
interposing
between
him
and
the
knife
it
was
something
like
this
that
i
said
my
horror
and
rage
were
delirious
and
carried
me
beyond
all
attempt
at
control
through
it
all
i
heard
a
shout
of
laughter
rising
from
everybody
round
the
lecturer
laughed
the
audience
roared
with
that
sound
of
horrible
mockery
which
had
driven
me
out
of
myself
in
my
first
experience
all
kinds
of
mocking
cries
sounded
around
me
him
a
little
blood
to
calm
him
down
the
fool
have
a
taste
of
it
himself
doctor
last
of
all
came
a
voice
mingled
with
the
cries
of
the
sufferer
whom
i
was
trying
to
shield
him
instead
curse
him
take
him
instead
i
was
bending
over
the
man
with
my
arms
outstretched
protecting
him
when
he
gave
vent
to
this
cry
and
i
heard
immediately
behind
me
a
shout
of
assent
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
two
strong
young
men
with
whom
i
had
been
standing
and
the
sound
of
a
rush
to
seize
me
i
looked
round
half
mad
with
terror
and
rage
a
second
more
and
i
should
have
been
strapped
on
the
table
too
i
made
one
wild
bound
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
and
struggling
among
the
arms
stretched
out
to
catch
me
amid
the
roar
of
the
laughter
and
cries
fled
fled
wildly
i
knew
not
whither
in
panic
and
rage
and
horror
which
no
words
could
describe
terror
winged
my
feet
i
flew
thinking
as
little
of
whom
i
met
or
knocked
down
or
trod
upon
in
my
way
as
the
others
did
at
whom
i
had
wondered
a
little
while
ago
no
distinct
impression
of
this
headlong
course
remains
in
my
mind
save
the
sensation
of
mad
fear
such
as
i
had
never
felt
before
i
came
to
myself
on
the
edge
of
the
dark
valley
which
surrounded
the
town
all
my
pursuers
had
dropped
off
before
that
time
and
i
have
the
recollection
of
flinging
myself
upon
the
ground
on
my
face
in
the
extremity
of
fatigue
and
exhaustion
i
must
have
lain
there
undisturbed
for
some
time
a
few
steps
came
and
went
passing
me
but
no
one
took
any
notice
and
the
absence
of
the
noise
and
crowding
gave
me
a
momentary
respite
but
in
my
heat
and
fever
i
got
no
relief
of
coolness
from
the
contact
of
the
soil
i
might
have
flung
myself
upon
a
bed
of
hot
ashes
so
much
was
it
unlike
the
dewy
cool
earth
which
i
expected
upon
which
one
can
always
throw
one
self
with
a
sensation
of
repose
presently
the
uneasiness
of
it
made
me
struggle
up
again
and
look
around
me
i
was
safe
at
least
the
cries
of
the
pursuers
had
died
away
the
laughter
which
made
my
blood
boil
offended
my
ears
no
more
the
noise
of
the
city
was
behind
me
softened
into
an
indefinite
roar
by
distance
and
before
me
stretched
out
the
dreary
landscape
in
which
there
seemed
no
features
of
attraction
now
that
i
was
nearer
to
it
i
found
it
not
so
unpeopled
as
i
thought
at
no
great
distance
from
me
was
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
mines
from
which
came
an
indication
of
subterranean
lights
and
i
perceived
that
the
flying
figures
which
i
had
taken
for
travellers
between
one
city
and
another
were
in
reality
wayfarers
endeavoring
to
keep
clear
of
what
seemed
a
sort
of
at
the
openings
one
of
them
unable
to
stop
himself
in
his
flight
adopted
the
same
expedient
as
myself
and
threw
himself
on
the
ground
close
to
me
when
he
had
got
beyond
the
range
of
pursuit
it
was
curious
that
we
should
meet
there
he
flying
from
a
danger
which
i
was
about
to
face
and
ready
to
encounter
that
from
which
i
had
fled
i
waited
for
a
few
minutes
till
he
had
recovered
his
breath
and
then
are
you
running
from
i
said
there
any
danger
there
the
man
looked
up
at
me
with
the
same
continual
question
in
his
eyes
who
is
this
fool
he
said
you
so
new
here
or
such
a
cursed
idiot
as
not
to
know
the
danger
of
the
mines
you
are
going
across
yourself
i
suppose
and
then
you
see
tell
me
i
said
experience
may
be
of
use
to
you
afterwards
if
you
will
tell
me
yours
now
use
he
cried
staring
cares
find
out
for
yourself
if
they
get
hold
of
you
you
will
soon
understand
i
no
longer
took
this
for
rudeness
but
answered
in
his
own
way
cursing
him
too
for
a
fool
i
ask
a
warning
i
can
give
one
as
for
kindness
i
said
was
not
looking
for
that
at
this
he
laughed
indeed
we
laughed
together
there
seemed
something
ridiculous
in
the
thought
and
presently
he
told
me
for
the
mere
relief
of
talking
that
round
each
of
these
there
was
a
band
to
entrap
every
who
allowed
himself
to
be
caught
and
send
him
down
below
to
work
in
the
mine
there
there
is
no
telling
when
you
may
get
free
he
said
time
or
other
most
people
have
a
taste
of
it
you
do
know
what
hard
labor
is
if
you
have
never
been
there
i
had
a
spell
once
there
is
neither
air
nor
light
your
blood
boils
in
your
veins
from
the
fervent
heat
you
are
never
allowed
to
rest
you
are
put
in
every
kind
of
contortion
to
get
at
it
your
limbs
twisted
and
your
muscles
strained
what
i
said
gold
he
cried
with
a
flash
in
his
eyes
there
it
is
inexhaustible
however
hard
you
may
work
there
is
always
more
and
more
to
whom
does
all
that
belong
i
said
whoever
is
strong
enough
to
get
hold
and
keep
possession
sometimes
one
sometimes
another
the
only
thing
you
are
sure
of
is
that
it
will
never
be
you
why
not
i
as
well
as
another
was
the
thought
that
went
through
my
mind
and
my
new
companion
spied
it
with
a
shriek
of
derision
is
not
for
you
nor
your
kind
he
cried
do
you
think
you
could
force
other
people
to
serve
can
you
terrify
them
or
hurt
them
or
give
them
anything
you
have
not
learned
yet
who
are
the
masters
here
this
troubled
me
for
it
was
true
had
begun
to
think
i
said
there
was
no
authority
at
all
for
every
man
seems
to
do
as
he
pleases
you
ride
over
one
and
knock
another
down
or
you
seize
a
living
man
and
cut
him
to
pieces
i
shuddered
as
i
thought
of
it
there
is
nobody
to
interfere
should
interfere
he
said
should
every
man
amuse
himself
as
he
can
but
yet
for
all
that
we
got
our
masters
he
cried
with
a
scowl
waving
his
clinched
fist
in
the
direction
of
the
mines
find
it
out
when
you
get
there
it
was
a
long
time
after
this
before
i
ventured
to
move
for
here
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
the
moment
i
was
safe
outside
the
city
yet
not
within
reach
of
the
dangers
of
that
intermediate
space
which
grew
clearer
before
me
as
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
lurid
threatening
afternoon
light
one
after
another
the
fugitives
came
flying
past
me
people
who
had
escaped
from
the
armed
bands
whom
i
could
now
see
on
the
watch
near
the
pit
mouth
i
could
see
too
the
tactics
of
these
bands
how
they
retired
veiling
the
lights
and
the
opening
when
a
greater
number
than
usual
of
travellers
appeared
on
the
way
and
then
suddenly
widening
out
throwing
out
flanking
lines
surrounded
and
drew
in
the
unwary
i
could
even
hear
the
cries
with
which
their
victims
disappeared
over
the
opening
which
seemed
to
go
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
by
and
by
there
came
flying
towards
me
a
wretch
more
dreadful
in
aspect
than
any
i
had
seen
his
scanty
clothes
seemed
singed
and
burned
into
rags
his
hair
which
hung
about
his
face
unkempt
and
uncared
for
had
the
same
singed
aspect
his
skin
was
brown
and
baked
i
got
up
as
he
approached
and
caught
him
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
without
heeding
his
struggles
to
get
on
you
see
he
cried
with
a
gasp
may
get
me
again
he
was
one
of
those
who
had
escaped
out
of
the
mines
but
what
was
it
to
me
whether
they
caught
him
again
or
not
i
wanted
to
know
how
he
had
been
caught
and
what
he
had
been
set
to
do
and
how
he
had
escaped
why
should
i
hesitate
to
use
my
superior
strength
when
no
one
else
did
i
kept
watch
over
him
that
he
should
not
get
away
have
been
in
the
mines
i
said
me
go
he
cried
you
need
to
ask
and
he
cursed
me
as
he
struggled
with
the
most
terrible
imprecations
may
get
me
yet
let
me
go
till
you
tell
me
i
cried
me
and
i
protect
you
if
they
come
near
i
let
you
go
who
are
they
man
i
must
know
he
struggled
up
from
the
ground
clearing
his
hot
eyes
from
the
ashes
that
were
in
them
and
putting
aside
his
singed
hair
he
gave
me
a
glance
of
hatred
and
impotent
resistance
for
i
was
stronger
than
he
and
then
cast
a
wild
terrified
look
back
the
skirmishers
did
not
seem
to
remark
that
anybody
had
escaped
and
he
became
gradually
a
little
more
composed
are
they
he
said
hoarsely
cursed
wretches
like
you
and
me
and
there
are
as
many
bands
of
them
as
there
are
mines
on
the
road
and
you
better
turn
back
and
stay
where
you
are
you
are
safe
here
will
not
turn
back
i
said
know
well
enough
you
ca
you
got
to
go
the
round
like
the
rest
he
said
with
a
laugh
which
was
like
a
sound
uttered
by
a
wild
animal
rather
than
a
human
voice
the
man
was
in
my
power
and
i
struck
him
miserable
as
he
was
it
seemed
a
relief
thus
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
fury
in
my
mind
a
lie
i
said
go
because
i
please
why
should
i
gather
a
band
of
my
own
if
i
please
and
fight
those
brutes
not
fly
from
them
like
you
he
chuckled
and
laughed
below
his
breath
struggling
and
cursing
and
crying
out
as
i
struck
him
again
gather
a
band
what
could
you
offer
them
where
would
you
find
them
are
you
better
than
the
rest
of
us
are
you
not
a
man
like
the
rest
strike
me
you
can
for
i
down
but
make
yourself
a
master
and
a
chief
you
not
i
i
shouted
again
wild
with
rage
and
the
sense
that
i
had
no
power
over
him
save
to
hurt
him
that
passion
made
my
hands
tremble
he
slipped
from
me
in
a
moment
bounded
from
the
ground
like
a
ball
and
with
a
yell
of
derision
escaped
and
plunged
into
the
streets
and
the
clamor
of
the
city
from
which
i
had
just
flown
i
felt
myself
rage
after
him
shaking
my
fists
with
a
consciousness
of
the
ridiculous
passion
of
impotence
that
was
in
me
but
no
power
of
restraining
it
and
there
was
not
one
of
the
fugitives
who
passed
however
desperate
he
might
be
who
did
not
make
a
mock
at
me
as
he
darted
by
the
of
all
those
miserable
objects
the
sport
of
fate
afraid
to
go
forwards
unable
to
go
back
with
a
fire
in
my
veins
urging
me
on
but
presently
i
grew
a
little
calmer
out
of
mere
exhaustion
which
was
all
the
relief
that
was
possible
to
me
and
by
and
by
collecting
all
my
faculties
and
impelled
by
this
impulse
which
i
seemed
unable
to
resist
i
got
up
and
went
cautiously
on
fear
can
act
in
two
ways
it
paralyzes
and
it
renders
cunning
at
this
moment
i
found
it
inspire
me
i
made
my
plans
before
i
started
how
to
steal
along
under
the
cover
of
the
blighted
brushwood
which
broke
the
line
of
the
valley
here
and
there
i
set
out
only
after
long
thought
seizing
the
moment
when
the
vaguely
perceived
band
were
scouring
in
the
other
direction
intercepting
the
travellers
thus
with
many
pauses
i
got
near
to
the
pit
mouth
in
safety
but
my
curiosity
was
as
great
as
almost
greater
than
my
terror
i
had
kept
far
from
the
road
dragging
myself
sometimes
on
hands
and
feet
over
broken
ground
tearing
my
clothes
and
my
flesh
upon
the
thorns
and
on
that
farther
side
all
seemed
so
silent
and
so
dark
in
the
shadow
cast
by
some
disused
machinery
behind
which
the
glare
of
the
fire
from
below
blazed
upon
the
other
side
of
the
opening
that
i
could
not
crawl
along
in
the
darkness
and
pass
which
would
have
been
the
safe
way
but
with
a
breathless
hot
desire
to
see
and
know
dragged
myself
to
the
very
edge
to
look
down
though
i
was
in
the
shadow
my
eyes
were
nearly
put
out
by
the
glare
on
which
i
gazed
it
was
not
fire
it
was
the
lurid
glow
of
the
gold
glowing
like
flame
at
which
countless
miners
were
working
they
were
all
about
like
flies
some
on
their
knees
some
bent
double
as
they
stooped
over
their
work
some
lying
cramped
upon
shelves
and
ledges
the
sight
was
wonderful
and
terrible
beyond
description
the
workmen
seemed
to
consume
away
with
the
heat
and
the
glow
even
in
the
few
minutes
i
gazed
their
eyes
shrank
into
their
heads
their
faces
blackened
i
could
see
some
trying
to
secret
morsels
of
the
glowing
metal
which
burned
whatever
it
touched
and
some
who
were
being
searched
by
the
superiors
of
the
mines
and
some
who
were
punishing
the
offenders
fixing
them
up
against
the
blazing
wall
of
gold
the
fear
went
out
of
my
mind
so
much
absorbed
was
i
in
this
sight
i
gazed
seeing
farther
and
farther
every
moment
into
crevices
and
seams
of
the
glowing
metal
always
with
more
and
more
slaves
at
work
and
the
entire
pantomime
of
labor
and
theft
and
search
and
punishment
going
on
and
on
the
baked
faces
dark
against
the
golden
glare
the
hot
eyes
taking
a
yellow
reflection
the
monotonous
clamor
of
pick
and
shovel
and
cries
and
curses
and
all
the
indistinguishable
sound
of
a
multitude
of
human
creatures
and
the
floor
below
and
the
low
roof
which
overhung
whole
myriads
within
a
few
inches
of
their
faces
and
the
irregular
walls
all
breached
and
shelved
were
every
one
the
same
a
pandemonium
of
gold
gold
everywhere
i
had
loved
many
foolish
things
in
my
life
but
never
this
which
was
perhaps
why
i
gazed
and
kept
my
sight
though
there
rose
out
of
it
a
blast
of
heat
which
scorched
the
brain
while
i
stooped
over
intent
on
the
sight
some
one
who
had
come
up
by
my
side
to
gaze
too
was
caught
by
the
fumes
as
i
suppose
for
suddenly
i
was
aware
of
a
dark
object
falling
prone
into
the
glowing
interior
with
a
cry
and
crash
which
brought
back
my
first
wild
panic
he
fell
in
a
heap
from
which
his
arms
shot
forth
wildly
as
he
reached
the
bottom
and
his
cry
was
half
anguish
yet
half
desire
i
saw
him
seized
by
half
a
dozen
eager
watchers
and
pitched
upon
a
ledge
just
under
the
roof
and
tools
thrust
into
his
hands
i
held
on
by
an
old
shaft
trembling
unable
to
move
perhaps
i
cried
too
in
my
horror
for
one
of
the
overseers
who
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
glare
looked
up
he
had
the
air
of
ordering
all
that
was
going
on
and
stood
unaffected
by
the
blaze
commanding
the
other
wretched
officials
who
obeyed
him
like
dogs
he
seemed
to
me
in
my
terror
like
a
figure
of
gold
the
image
perhaps
of
wealth
or
pluto
or
i
know
not
what
for
i
suppose
my
brain
began
to
grow
confused
and
my
hold
on
the
shaft
to
relax
i
had
strength
enough
however
for
i
cared
not
for
the
gold
to
fling
myself
back
the
other
way
upon
the
ground
where
i
rolled
backwards
downwards
i
knew
not
how
turning
over
and
over
upon
sharp
ashes
and
metallic
edges
which
tore
my
hair
and
and
for
a
moment
i
knew
no
more
this
fall
saved
me
i
came
to
myself
after
a
time
and
heard
the
searching
about
i
had
sense
to
lie
still
among
the
ashes
thrown
up
out
of
the
pit
while
i
heard
their
voices
once
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
the
glitter
of
a
lantern
flashed
in
my
eyes
a
foot
passed
crashing
among
the
ashes
so
close
to
my
cheek
that
the
shoe
grazed
it
i
found
the
mark
after
burned
upon
my
flesh
but
i
escaped
notice
by
a
miracle
and
presently
i
was
able
to
drag
myself
up
and
crawl
away
but
how
i
reached
the
end
of
the
valley
i
can
not
tell
i
pushed
my
way
along
mechanically
on
the
dark
side
i
had
no
further
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
openings
of
the
mines
i
went
on
stumbling
and
stupid
scarcely
capable
even
of
fear
conscious
only
of
wretchedness
and
weariness
till
at
last
i
felt
myself
drop
across
the
road
within
the
gateway
of
the
other
town
and
lay
there
with
no
thought
of
anything
but
the
relief
of
being
at
rest
when
i
came
to
myself
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
atmosphere
and
the
light
it
was
less
lurid
paler
gray
more
like
twilight
than
the
stormy
afternoon
of
the
other
city
a
certain
dead
serenity
was
in
the
sky
black
paleness
whiteness
everything
faint
in
it
this
town
was
walled
but
the
gates
stood
open
and
i
saw
no
defences
of
troops
or
other
guardians
i
found
myself
lying
across
the
threshold
but
pushed
to
one
side
so
that
the
carriages
which
went
and
came
should
not
be
stopped
or
i
injured
by
their
passage
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
some
thoughtfulness
and
kindness
in
this
action
and
my
heart
sprang
up
in
a
reaction
of
hope
i
looked
back
as
if
upon
a
nightmare
on
the
dreadful
city
which
i
had
left
on
its
tumults
and
noise
the
wild
racket
of
the
streets
the
wounded
wretches
who
sought
refuge
in
the
corners
the
strife
and
misery
that
were
abroad
and
climax
of
all
the
horrible
entertainment
which
had
been
going
on
in
the
square
the
unhappy
being
strapped
upon
the
table
how
i
said
to
myself
could
such
things
be
was
it
a
dream
was
it
a
nightmare
was
it
something
presented
to
me
in
a
vision
a
strong
delusion
to
make
me
think
that
the
old
fables
which
had
been
told
concerning
the
end
of
mortal
life
were
true
when
i
looked
back
it
appeared
like
an
allegory
so
that
i
might
have
seen
it
in
a
dream
and
still
more
like
an
allegory
were
the
gold
mines
in
the
valley
and
the
myriads
who
labored
there
was
it
all
true
or
only
a
reflection
from
the
old
life
mingling
with
the
strange
novelties
which
would
most
likely
elude
understanding
on
the
entrance
into
this
new
i
sat
within
the
shelter
of
the
gateway
on
my
awakening
and
thought
over
all
this
my
heart
was
calm
almost
in
the
revulsion
from
the
terrors
i
had
been
through
happy
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
was
but
now
beginning
that
there
had
been
no
reality
in
these
latter
experiences
only
a
curious
succession
of
nightmares
such
as
might
so
well
be
supposed
to
follow
a
wonderful
transformation
like
that
which
must
take
place
between
our
mortal
life
and
the
world
to
come
the
world
to
come
i
paused
and
thought
of
it
all
until
the
heart
began
to
beat
loud
in
my
breast
what
was
this
where
i
lay
another
world
a
world
which
was
not
happiness
not
bliss
oh
no
perhaps
there
was
no
world
of
bliss
save
in
dreams
this
on
the
other
hand
i
said
to
myself
was
not
misery
for
was
not
i
seated
here
with
a
certain
tremulousness
about
me
it
was
true
after
all
the
experiences
which
supposing
them
even
to
have
been
but
dreams
i
had
come
through
a
tremulousness
very
comprehensible
and
not
at
all
without
hope
i
will
not
say
that
i
believed
even
what
i
tried
to
think
something
in
me
lay
like
a
dark
shadow
in
the
midst
of
all
my
theories
but
yet
i
succeeded
to
a
great
degree
in
convincing
myself
that
the
hope
in
me
was
real
and
that
i
was
but
now
beginning
beginning
with
at
least
a
possibility
that
all
might
be
well
in
this
half
conviction
and
after
all
the
troubles
that
were
over
even
though
they
might
only
have
been
imaginary
troubles
i
felt
a
certain
sweetness
in
resting
there
within
the
gateway
with
my
back
against
it
i
was
unwilling
to
get
up
again
and
bring
myself
in
contact
with
reality
i
felt
that
there
was
pleasure
in
being
left
alone
carriages
rolled
past
me
occasionally
and
now
and
then
some
people
on
foot
but
they
did
not
kick
me
out
of
the
way
or
interfere
with
my
repose
presently
as
i
sat
trying
to
persuade
myself
to
rise
and
pursue
my
way
two
men
came
up
to
me
in
a
sort
of
uniform
i
recognized
with
another
distinct
sensation
of
pleasure
that
here
were
people
who
had
authority
representatives
of
some
kind
of
government
they
came
up
to
me
and
bade
me
come
with
them
in
tones
which
were
peremptory
enough
but
what
of
that
better
the
most
peremptory
supervision
than
the
lawlessness
from
which
i
had
come
they
raised
me
from
the
ground
with
a
touch
for
i
could
not
resist
them
and
led
me
quickly
along
the
street
into
which
that
gateway
gave
access
which
was
a
handsome
street
with
tall
houses
on
either
side
groups
of
people
were
moving
about
along
the
pavement
talking
now
and
then
with
considerable
animation
but
when
my
companions
were
seen
there
was
an
immediate
moderation
of
tone
a
sort
of
respect
which
looked
like
fear
there
was
no
brawling
nor
tumult
of
any
kind
in
the
street
the
only
incident
that
occurred
was
this
when
we
had
gone
some
way
i
saw
a
lame
man
dragging
himself
along
with
difficulty
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
my
conductors
had
no
sooner
perceived
him
than
they
gave
each
other
a
look
and
darted
across
conveying
me
with
them
by
a
sweep
of
magnetic
influence
i
thought
that
prevented
me
from
staying
behind
he
made
an
attempt
with
his
crutches
to
get
out
of
the
way
hurrying
on
and
i
will
allow
that
this
attempt
of
his
seemed
to
me
very
grotesque
so
that
i
could
scarcely
help
laughing
the
other
in
the
street
laughed
too
though
some
put
on
an
aspect
of
disgust
the
tortoise
some
one
said
he
think
he
can
go
quicker
than
the
orderlies
my
companions
came
up
to
the
man
while
this
commentary
was
going
on
and
seized
him
by
each
arm
were
you
going
where
have
you
come
from
how
dare
you
make
an
exhibition
of
yourself
they
cried
they
took
the
crutches
from
him
as
they
spoke
and
threw
them
away
and
dragged
him
on
until
we
reached
a
great
grated
door
which
one
of
them
opened
with
a
key
while
the
other
held
the
offender
for
he
seemed
an
offender
roughly
up
by
one
shoulder
causing
him
great
pain
when
the
door
was
opened
i
saw
a
number
of
people
within
who
seemed
to
crowd
to
the
door
as
if
seeking
to
get
out
but
this
was
not
at
all
what
was
intended
my
second
companion
dragged
the
lame
man
forwards
and
pushed
him
in
with
so
much
violence
that
i
could
see
him
fall
forwards
on
his
face
on
the
floor
then
the
other
locked
the
door
and
we
proceeded
on
our
way
it
was
not
till
some
time
later
that
i
understood
why
in
the
mean
time
i
was
hurried
on
meeting
a
great
many
people
who
took
no
notice
of
me
to
a
central
building
in
the
middle
of
the
town
where
i
was
brought
before
an
official
attended
by
clerks
with
great
books
spread
out
before
him
here
i
was
questioned
as
to
my
name
and
my
antecedents
and
the
time
of
my
arrival
then
dismissed
with
a
nod
to
one
of
my
conductors
he
led
me
back
again
down
the
street
took
me
into
one
of
the
tall
great
houses
opened
the
door
of
a
room
which
was
numbered
and
left
me
there
without
a
word
i
can
not
convey
to
any
one
the
bewildered
consternation
with
which
i
felt
myself
deposited
here
and
as
the
steps
of
my
conductor
died
away
in
the
long
corridor
i
sat
down
and
looking
myself
in
the
face
as
it
were
tried
to
make
out
what
it
was
that
had
happened
to
me
the
room
was
small
and
bare
there
was
but
one
thing
hung
upon
the
undecorated
walls
and
that
was
a
long
list
of
printed
regulations
which
i
had
not
the
courage
for
the
moment
to
look
at
the
light
was
indifferent
though
the
room
was
high
up
and
the
street
from
the
window
looked
far
away
below
i
can
not
tell
how
long
i
sat
there
thinking
and
yet
it
could
scarcely
be
called
thought
i
asked
myself
over
and
over
again
where
am
i
is
it
a
prison
am
i
shut
in
to
leave
this
enclosure
no
more
what
am
i
to
do
how
is
the
time
to
pass
i
shut
my
eyes
for
a
moment
and
tried
to
realize
all
that
had
happened
to
me
but
nothing
save
a
whirl
through
my
head
of
disconnected
thoughts
seemed
possible
and
some
force
was
upon
me
to
open
my
eyes
again
to
see
the
blank
room
the
dull
light
the
vacancy
round
me
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
interest
the
mind
nothing
to
please
the
eye
a
blank
wherever
i
turned
presently
there
came
upon
me
a
burning
regret
for
everything
i
had
left
for
the
noisy
town
with
all
its
tumults
and
cruelties
for
the
dark
valley
with
all
its
dangers
everything
seemed
bearable
almost
agreeable
in
comparison
with
this
i
seemed
to
have
been
brought
here
to
make
acquaintance
once
more
with
myself
to
learn
over
again
what
manner
of
man
i
was
needless
knowledge
acquaintance
unnecessary
unhappy
for
what
was
there
in
me
to
make
me
to
myself
a
good
companion
never
i
knew
could
i
separate
myself
from
that
eternal
consciousness
but
it
was
cruelty
to
force
the
contemplation
upon
me
all
blank
blank
around
me
a
prison
and
was
this
to
last
forever
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
sat
rapt
in
this
gloomy
vision
but
at
last
it
occurred
to
me
to
rise
and
try
the
door
which
to
my
astonishment
was
open
i
went
out
with
a
throb
of
new
hope
after
all
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
come
back
there
might
be
other
expedients
i
might
fall
among
friends
i
turned
down
the
long
echoing
stairs
on
which
i
met
various
people
who
took
no
notice
of
me
and
in
whom
i
felt
no
interest
save
a
desire
to
avoid
them
and
at
last
reached
the
street
to
be
out
of
doors
in
the
air
was
something
though
there
was
no
wind
but
a
motionless
still
atmosphere
which
nothing
disturbed
the
streets
indeed
were
full
of
movement
but
not
of
life
though
this
seems
a
paradox
the
passengers
passed
on
their
way
in
long
regulated
lines
those
who
went
towards
the
gates
keeping
rigorously
to
one
side
of
the
pavement
those
who
came
to
the
other
they
talked
to
each
other
here
and
there
but
whenever
two
men
in
uniform
such
as
those
who
had
been
my
conductors
appeared
silence
ensued
and
the
wayfarers
shrank
even
from
the
looks
of
these
persons
in
authority
i
walked
all
about
the
spacious
town
everywhere
there
were
tall
houses
everywhere
streams
of
people
coming
and
going
but
no
one
spoke
to
me
or
remarked
me
at
all
i
was
as
lonely
as
if
i
had
been
in
a
wilderness
i
was
indeed
in
a
wilderness
of
men
who
were
as
though
they
did
not
see
me
passing
without
even
a
look
of
human
fellowship
each
absorbed
in
his
own
concerns
i
walked
and
walked
till
my
limbs
trembled
under
me
from
one
end
to
another
of
the
great
streets
up
and
down
and
round
and
round
but
no
one
said
how
are
you
whence
come
you
what
are
you
doing
at
length
in
despair
i
turned
again
to
the
blank
and
miserable
room
which
had
looked
to
me
like
a
cell
in
a
prison
i
had
wilfully
made
no
note
of
its
situation
trying
to
avoid
rather
than
to
find
it
but
my
steps
were
drawn
thither
against
my
will
i
found
myself
retracing
my
steps
mounting
the
long
stairs
passing
the
same
people
who
streamed
along
with
no
recognition
of
me
as
i
desired
nothing
to
do
with
them
and
at
last
found
myself
within
the
same
four
blank
walls
as
before
soon
after
i
returned
i
became
conscious
of
measured
steps
passing
the
door
and
of
an
eye
upon
me
i
can
say
no
more
than
this
from
what
point
it
was
that
i
was
inspected
i
can
not
tell
but
that
i
was
inspected
closely
scrutinized
by
some
one
and
that
not
only
externally
but
by
a
cold
observation
that
went
through
and
through
me
i
knew
and
felt
beyond
any
possibility
of
mistake
this
recurred
from
time
to
time
horribly
at
uncertain
moments
so
that
i
never
felt
myself
secure
from
it
i
knew
when
the
watcher
was
coming
by
tremors
and
shiverings
through
all
my
being
and
no
sensation
so
unsupportable
has
it
ever
been
mine
to
bear
how
much
that
is
to
say
no
one
can
tell
who
has
not
gone
through
those
regions
of
darkness
and
learned
what
is
in
all
their
abysses
i
tried
at
first
to
hide
to
fling
myself
on
the
floor
to
cover
my
face
to
burrow
in
a
dark
corner
useless
attempts
the
eyes
that
looked
in
upon
me
had
powers
beyond
my
powers
i
felt
sometimes
conscious
of
the
derisive
smile
with
which
my
miserable
subterfuges
were
regarded
they
were
all
in
vain
and
what
was
still
more
strange
was
that
i
had
not
energy
to
think
of
attempting
any
escape
my
steps
though
watched
were
not
restrained
in
any
way
so
far
as
i
was
aware
the
gates
of
the
city
stood
open
on
all
sides
free
to
those
who
went
as
well
as
to
those
who
came
but
i
did
not
think
of
flight
of
flight
whence
should
i
go
from
myself
though
that
horrible
inspection
was
from
the
eyes
of
some
unseen
being
it
was
in
some
mysterious
way
connected
with
my
own
thinking
and
reflections
so
that
the
thought
came
ever
more
and
more
strongly
upon
me
that
from
myself
i
could
never
escape
and
that
reflection
took
all
energy
all
impulse
from
me
i
might
have
gone
away
when
i
pleased
beyond
reach
of
the
authority
which
regulated
everything
how
one
should
walk
where
one
should
live
but
never
from
my
own
consciousness
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
lay
a
great
plain
traversed
by
roads
on
every
side
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
not
continue
my
journey
there
but
i
did
not
i
had
no
wish
nor
any
power
in
me
to
go
away
in
one
of
my
long
dreary
companionless
walks
unshared
by
any
human
fellowship
i
saw
at
last
a
face
which
i
remembered
it
was
that
of
the
cynical
spectator
who
had
spoken
to
me
in
the
noisy
street
in
the
midst
of
my
early
experiences
he
gave
a
glance
round
him
to
see
that
there
were
no
officials
in
sight
then
left
the
file
in
which
he
was
walking
and
joined
me
he
said
are
here
already
with
the
same
derisive
smile
with
which
he
had
before
regarded
me
i
hated
the
man
and
his
sneer
yet
that
he
should
speak
to
me
was
something
almost
a
pleasure
said
i
am
here
then
after
a
pause
in
which
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
is
quiet
here
i
said
enough
do
you
like
it
better
for
that
to
do
whatever
you
please
with
no
one
to
interfere
or
to
do
nothing
you
please
but
as
you
are
forced
to
do
it
which
do
you
think
is
best
i
felt
myself
instinctively
glance
round
as
he
had
done
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
in
sight
then
i
answered
faltering
have
always
held
that
law
and
order
were
necessary
things
and
the
lawlessness
of
that
that
place
i
do
know
its
name
if
there
is
such
a
place
i
cried
thought
it
was
a
dream
he
laughed
in
his
mocking
way
it
is
all
a
dream
who
knows
he
said
said
i
have
been
longer
here
than
i
cried
he
with
a
laugh
that
was
dry
and
jarred
upon
the
air
almost
like
a
shriek
before
your
forefathers
were
born
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
spoke
like
one
who
out
of
bitterness
and
despite
made
every
darkness
blacker
still
a
kind
of
madman
in
his
way
for
what
was
this
claim
of
age
a
piece
of
bravado
no
doubt
like
the
rest
is
strange
i
said
assenting
as
when
there
is
such
a
hallucination
it
is
best
to
do
can
tell
me
then
whence
all
this
authority
comes
and
why
we
are
obliged
to
obey
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
were
thinking
in
his
mind
how
to
hurt
me
most
then
with
that
dry
laugh
make
trial
of
all
things
in
this
world
he
said
see
if
perhaps
we
can
find
something
we
shall
discipline
here
freedom
in
the
other
place
when
you
have
gone
all
the
round
like
me
then
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
choose
you
chosen
i
asked
he
only
answered
with
a
laugh
he
said
is
amusement
to
be
had
too
and
that
of
the
most
elevated
kind
we
make
researches
here
into
the
moral
nature
of
man
will
you
come
but
you
must
take
the
risk
he
added
with
a
smile
which
afterwards
i
understood
we
went
on
together
after
this
till
we
reached
the
centre
of
the
place
in
which
stood
an
immense
building
with
a
dome
which
dominated
the
city
and
into
a
great
hall
in
the
centre
of
that
where
a
crowd
of
people
were
assembled
the
sound
of
human
speech
which
murmured
all
around
brought
new
life
to
my
heart
and
as
i
gazed
at
a
curious
apparatus
erected
on
a
platform
several
people
spoke
to
me
have
again
said
one
old
subject
it
something
about
the
constitution
of
the
place
i
asked
in
the
bewilderment
of
my
mind
my
neighbors
looked
at
me
with
alarm
glancing
behind
them
to
see
what
officials
might
be
near
constitution
of
the
place
is
the
result
of
the
sense
of
the
inhabitants
that
order
must
be
preserved
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
to
me
first
lawless
can
find
refuge
in
other
places
here
we
have
chosen
to
have
supervision
nuisances
removed
and
order
kept
that
is
enough
the
constitution
is
not
under
discussion
man
is
said
a
second
speaker
us
keep
to
that
in
which
we
can
mend
nothing
sir
you
may
have
to
contribute
your
quota
to
our
enlightenment
we
are
investigating
the
rise
of
thought
you
are
a
stranger
you
may
be
able
to
help
us
am
no
philosopher
i
said
with
a
panic
which
i
could
not
explain
to
myself
does
not
matter
you
are
a
fresh
subject
the
speaker
made
a
slight
movement
with
his
hand
and
i
turned
round
to
escape
in
wild
sudden
fright
though
i
had
no
conception
what
could
be
done
to
me
but
the
crowd
had
pressed
close
round
me
hemming
one
in
on
every
side
i
was
so
wildly
alarmed
that
i
struggled
among
them
pushing
backwards
with
all
my
force
and
clearing
a
space
round
me
with
my
arms
but
my
efforts
were
vain
two
of
the
officers
suddenly
appeared
out
of
the
crowd
and
seizing
me
by
the
arms
forced
me
forwards
the
throng
dispersed
before
them
on
either
side
and
i
was
half
dragged
half
lifted
up
upon
the
platform
where
stood
the
strange
apparatus
which
i
had
contemplated
with
a
dull
wonder
when
i
came
into
the
hall
my
wonder
did
not
last
long
i
felt
myself
fixed
in
it
standing
supported
in
that
position
by
bands
and
springs
so
that
no
effort
of
mine
was
necessary
to
hold
myself
up
and
none
possible
to
release
myself
i
was
caught
by
every
joint
sustained
supported
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
what
seemed
a
world
of
upturned
faces
among
which
i
saw
with
a
sneer
upon
it
keeping
a
little
behind
the
crowd
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
led
me
here
above
my
head
was
a
strong
light
more
brilliant
than
anything
i
had
ever
seen
and
which
blazed
upon
my
brain
till
the
hair
seemed
to
singe
and
the
skin
shrink
i
hope
i
may
never
feel
such
a
sensation
again
the
pitiless
light
went
into
me
like
a
knife
but
even
my
cries
were
stopped
by
the
framework
in
which
i
was
bound
i
could
breathe
and
suffer
but
that
was
all
then
some
one
got
up
on
the
platform
above
me
and
began
to
speak
he
said
so
far
as
i
could
comprehend
in
the
anguish
and
torture
in
which
i
was
held
that
the
origin
of
thought
was
the
question
he
was
investigating
but
that
in
every
previous
subject
the
confusion
of
ideas
had
bewildered
them
and
the
rapidity
with
which
one
followed
another
present
example
has
been
found
to
exhibit
great
persistency
of
idea
he
said
hope
that
by
his
means
some
clearer
theory
may
be
arrived
at
then
he
pulled
over
me
a
great
movable
lens
as
of
a
microscope
which
concentrated
the
insupportable
light
the
wild
hopeless
passion
that
raged
within
my
soul
had
no
outlet
in
the
immovable
apparatus
that
held
me
i
was
let
down
among
the
crowd
and
exhibited
to
them
every
secret
movement
of
my
being
by
some
awful
process
which
i
have
never
fathomed
a
burning
fire
was
in
my
brain
flame
seemed
to
run
along
all
my
nerves
speechless
horrible
incommunicable
fury
raged
in
my
soul
but
i
was
like
a
child
nay
like
an
image
of
wood
or
wax
in
the
pitiless
hands
that
held
me
what
was
the
cut
of
a
surgeon
knife
to
this
and
i
had
thought
cruel
and
i
was
powerless
and
could
do
nothing
to
blast
to
destroy
to
burn
with
this
same
horrible
flame
the
fiends
that
surrounded
me
as
i
desired
to
do
suddenly
in
the
raging
fever
of
my
thoughts
there
surged
up
the
recollection
of
that
word
which
had
paralyzed
all
around
and
myself
with
them
the
thought
that
i
must
share
the
anguish
did
not
restrain
me
from
my
revenge
with
a
tremendous
effort
i
got
my
voice
though
the
instrument
pressed
upon
my
lips
i
know
not
what
i
articulated
save
whether
it
was
a
curse
or
a
blessing
i
had
been
swung
out
into
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
hung
amid
the
crowd
exposed
to
all
their
observations
when
i
succeeded
in
gaining
utterance
my
god
my
god
another
moment
and
i
had
forgotten
them
and
all
my
fury
in
the
tortures
that
arose
within
myself
what
then
was
the
light
that
racked
my
brain
once
more
my
life
from
its
beginning
to
its
end
rose
up
before
me
each
scene
like
a
spectre
like
the
harpies
of
the
old
fables
rending
me
with
tooth
and
claw
once
more
i
saw
what
might
have
been
the
noble
things
i
might
have
done
the
happiness
i
had
lost
the
turnings
of
the
fated
road
which
i
might
have
taken
everything
that
was
once
so
possible
so
possible
so
easy
but
now
possible
no
more
my
anguish
was
immeasurable
i
turned
and
wrenched
myself
in
the
strength
of
pain
out
of
the
machinery
that
held
me
and
fell
down
down
among
all
the
curses
that
were
being
hurled
at
me
among
the
horrible
and
miserable
crowd
i
had
brought
upon
them
the
evil
which
i
shared
and
they
fell
upon
me
with
a
fury
which
was
like
that
which
had
prompted
myself
a
few
minutes
before
but
they
could
do
nothing
to
me
so
tremendous
as
the
vengeance
i
had
taken
upon
them
i
was
too
miserable
to
feel
the
blows
that
rained
upon
me
but
presently
i
suppose
i
lost
consciousness
altogether
being
almost
torn
to
pieces
by
the
multitude
while
this
lasted
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
a
dream
i
felt
the
blows
raining
down
upon
me
and
my
body
struggling
upon
the
ground
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
lying
outside
upon
the
ground
and
above
me
the
pale
sky
which
never
brightened
at
the
touch
of
the
sun
and
i
thought
that
dull
persistent
cloud
wavered
and
broke
for
an
instant
and
that
i
saw
behind
a
glimpse
of
that
blue
which
is
heaven
when
we
are
on
the
earth
the
blue
sky
which
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
in
the
mortal
life
which
is
heaven
enough
which
is
delight
enough
for
those
who
can
look
up
to
it
and
feel
themselves
in
the
land
of
hope
it
might
be
but
a
dream
in
this
strange
world
who
could
tell
what
was
vision
and
what
was
true
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
that
i
found
myself
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
great
room
full
of
people
with
every
kind
of
disease
and
deformity
some
pale
with
sickness
some
with
fresh
wounds
the
lame
and
the
maimed
and
the
miserable
they
lay
round
me
in
every
attitude
of
pain
many
with
sores
some
bleeding
with
broken
limbs
but
all
struggling
some
on
hands
and
knees
dragging
themselves
up
from
the
ground
to
stare
at
me
they
roused
in
my
mind
a
loathing
and
sense
of
disgust
which
it
is
impossible
to
express
i
could
scarcely
tolerate
the
thought
that
i
i
should
be
forced
to
remain
a
moment
in
this
the
feeling
with
which
i
had
regarded
the
miserable
creature
who
shared
the
corner
of
the
wall
with
me
and
who
had
cursed
me
for
being
sorry
for
him
had
altogether
gone
out
of
my
mind
i
called
out
to
whom
i
know
not
adjuring
some
one
to
open
the
door
and
set
me
free
but
my
cry
was
answered
only
by
a
shout
from
my
companions
in
trouble
do
you
think
will
let
you
out
is
going
to
help
you
more
than
the
rest
my
whole
body
was
racked
with
pain
i
could
not
move
from
the
floor
on
which
i
lay
i
had
to
put
up
with
the
stares
of
the
curious
and
the
mockeries
and
remarks
on
me
of
whoever
chose
to
criticise
among
them
was
the
lame
man
whom
i
had
seen
thrust
in
by
the
two
officers
who
had
taken
me
from
the
gate
he
was
the
first
to
jibe
for
him
they
would
never
have
seen
me
he
said
should
have
been
well
by
this
time
in
the
fresh
air
is
his
turn
now
said
another
i
turned
my
head
as
well
as
i
could
and
spoke
to
them
all
am
a
stranger
here
i
cried
have
made
my
brain
burn
with
their
experiments
will
nobody
help
me
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
it
is
their
fault
if
i
am
to
be
left
here
uncared
for
i
shall
die
at
this
a
sort
of
dreadful
chuckle
ran
round
the
place
that
is
what
you
are
afraid
of
you
will
not
die
somebody
said
touching
me
on
my
head
in
a
way
which
gave
me
intolerable
pain
touch
me
i
cried
should
i
said
the
other
and
pushed
me
again
upon
the
throbbing
brain
so
far
as
my
sensations
went
there
were
no
coverings
at
all
neither
skull
nor
skin
upon
the
intolerable
throbbing
of
my
head
which
had
been
exposed
to
the
curiosity
of
the
crowd
and
every
touch
was
agony
but
my
cry
brought
no
guardian
nor
any
defence
or
soothing
i
dragged
myself
into
a
corner
after
a
time
from
which
some
other
wretch
had
been
rolled
out
in
the
course
of
a
quarrel
and
as
i
found
that
silence
was
the
only
policy
i
kept
silent
with
rage
consuming
my
heart
presently
i
discovered
by
means
of
the
new
arrivals
which
kept
coming
in
hurled
into
the
midst
of
us
without
thought
or
question
that
this
was
the
common
fate
of
all
who
were
repulsive
to
the
sight
or
who
had
any
weakness
or
imperfection
which
offended
the
eyes
of
the
population
they
were
tossed
in
among
us
not
to
be
healed
or
for
repose
or
safety
but
to
be
out
of
sight
that
they
might
not
disgust
or
annoy
those
who
were
more
fortunate
to
whom
no
injury
had
happened
and
because
in
their
sickness
and
imperfection
they
were
of
no
use
in
the
studies
of
the
place
and
disturbed
the
good
order
of
the
streets
and
there
they
lay
one
above
another
a
mass
of
bruised
and
broken
creatures
most
of
them
suffering
from
injuries
which
they
had
sustained
in
what
would
have
been
called
in
other
regions
the
service
of
the
state
they
had
served
like
myself
as
objects
of
experiments
they
had
fallen
from
heights
where
they
had
been
placed
in
illustration
of
some
theory
they
had
been
tortured
or
twisted
to
give
satisfaction
to
some
question
and
then
that
the
consequences
of
these
proceedings
might
offend
no
one
eyes
they
were
flung
into
this
receptacle
to
be
released
if
chance
or
strength
enabled
them
to
push
their
way
out
when
others
were
brought
in
or
when
their
importunate
knocking
wearied
some
watchman
and
brought
him
angry
and
threatening
to
hear
what
was
wanted
the
sound
of
this
knocking
against
the
door
and
of
the
cries
that
accompanied
it
and
the
rush
towards
the
opening
when
any
one
was
brought
in
caused
a
hideous
continuous
noise
and
scuffle
which
was
agony
to
my
brain
every
one
pushed
before
the
other
there
was
an
endless
rising
and
falling
as
in
the
changes
of
a
feverish
dream
each
man
as
he
got
strength
to
struggle
forwards
himself
thrusting
back
his
neighbors
and
those
who
were
nearest
to
the
door
beating
upon
it
without
cease
like
the
beating
of
a
drum
without
cadence
or
measure
sometimes
a
dozen
passionate
hands
together
making
a
horrible
din
and
riot
as
i
lay
unable
to
join
in
that
struggle
and
moved
by
rage
unspeakable
towards
all
who
could
i
reflected
strangely
that
i
had
never
heard
when
outside
this
horrible
continual
appeal
of
the
suffering
in
the
streets
of
the
city
as
i
now
reflected
quiet
reigned
i
had
even
made
comparisons
on
my
first
entrance
in
the
moment
of
pleasant
anticipation
which
came
over
me
of
the
happy
stillness
here
with
the
horror
and
tumult
of
that
place
of
unrule
which
i
had
left
when
my
thoughts
reached
this
point
i
was
answered
by
the
voice
of
some
one
on
a
level
with
myself
lying
helpless
like
me
on
the
floor
of
the
have
taken
their
precautions
he
said
they
will
not
endure
the
sight
of
suffering
how
should
they
hear
the
sound
of
it
every
cry
is
silenced
there
wish
they
could
be
silenced
within
too
i
cried
savagely
would
make
them
dumb
had
i
the
power
spirit
of
the
place
is
in
you
said
the
other
voice
not
in
you
i
said
raising
my
head
though
every
movement
was
agony
but
this
pretence
of
superiority
was
more
than
i
could
bear
the
other
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
then
he
said
faintly
it
is
so
it
is
but
for
greater
misery
and
then
his
voice
died
away
and
the
hubbub
of
beating
and
crying
and
cursing
and
groaning
filled
all
the
echoes
they
cried
but
no
one
listened
to
them
they
thundered
on
the
door
but
in
vain
they
aggravated
all
their
pangs
in
that
mad
struggle
to
get
free
after
a
while
my
companion
whoever
he
was
spoke
again
would
rather
he
said
on
the
roadside
to
be
kicked
and
trodden
on
as
we
have
seen
though
to
see
that
made
you
miserable
me
miserable
you
mock
me
i
said
should
a
man
be
miserable
save
for
suffering
of
his
own
thought
otherwise
once
my
neighbor
said
and
then
i
remembered
the
wretch
in
the
corner
of
the
wall
in
the
other
town
who
had
cursed
me
for
pitying
him
i
cursed
myself
now
for
that
folly
pity
him
was
he
not
better
off
than
i
wish
i
cried
i
could
crush
them
into
nothing
and
be
rid
of
this
infernal
noise
they
make
spirit
of
the
place
has
entered
into
you
said
that
voice
i
raised
my
arm
to
strike
him
but
my
hand
fell
on
the
stone
floor
instead
and
sent
a
jar
of
new
pain
all
through
my
battered
frame
and
then
i
mastered
my
rage
and
lay
still
for
i
knew
there
was
no
way
but
this
of
recovering
my
strength
the
strength
with
which
when
i
got
it
back
i
would
annihilate
that
reproachful
voice
and
crush
the
life
out
of
those
groaning
fools
whose
cries
and
impotent
struggles
i
could
not
endure
and
we
lay
a
long
time
without
moving
with
always
that
tumult
raging
in
our
ears
at
last
there
came
into
my
mind
a
longing
to
hear
spoken
words
again
i
said
you
still
there
shall
be
here
he
said
i
am
able
to
begin
again
begin
is
there
here
then
either
beginning
or
ending
go
on
speak
to
me
it
makes
me
a
little
forget
my
pain
have
a
fire
in
my
heart
he
said
must
begin
and
begin
till
perhaps
i
find
the
way
way
i
cried
feverish
and
eager
for
though
i
despised
him
yet
it
made
me
wonder
to
think
that
he
should
speak
riddles
which
i
could
not
understand
he
answered
very
faintly
do
not
know
the
fool
then
it
was
only
folly
as
from
the
first
i
knew
it
was
i
felt
then
that
i
could
treat
him
roughly
after
the
fashion
of
the
place
which
he
said
had
got
into
me
wretch
i
said
have
hopes
have
you
where
have
you
come
from
you
might
have
learned
better
before
now
have
come
he
said
where
we
met
before
i
have
come
by
the
valley
of
gold
i
have
worked
in
the
mines
i
have
served
in
the
troops
of
those
who
are
masters
there
i
have
lived
in
this
town
of
tyrants
and
lain
in
this
before
everything
has
happened
to
me
more
and
worse
than
you
dream
of
still
you
go
on
i
would
dash
my
head
against
the
wall
and
die
will
you
learn
he
said
with
a
strange
tone
in
his
voice
which
though
no
one
had
been
listening
to
us
made
a
sudden
silence
for
a
moment
it
was
so
strange
it
moved
me
like
that
glimmer
of
the
blue
sky
in
my
dream
and
roused
all
the
sufferers
round
with
an
expectation
though
i
know
not
what
the
cries
stopped
the
hands
beat
no
longer
i
think
all
the
miserable
crowd
were
still
and
turned
to
where
he
lay
will
you
learn
that
you
have
died
and
can
die
no
more
there
was
a
shout
of
fury
all
around
me
that
all
you
have
to
say
the
crowd
burst
forth
and
i
think
they
rushed
upon
him
and
killed
him
for
i
heard
no
more
until
the
hubbub
began
again
more
wild
than
ever
with
furious
hands
beating
beating
against
the
locked
door
after
a
while
i
began
to
feel
my
strength
come
back
i
raised
my
head
i
sat
up
i
began
to
see
the
faces
of
those
around
me
and
the
groups
into
which
they
gathered
the
noise
was
no
longer
so
insupportable
my
racked
nerves
were
regaining
health
it
was
with
a
mixture
of
pleasure
and
despair
that
i
became
conscious
of
this
i
had
been
through
many
deaths
but
i
did
not
die
perhaps
could
not
as
that
man
had
said
i
looked
about
for
him
to
see
if
he
had
contradicted
his
own
theory
but
he
was
not
dead
he
was
lying
close
to
me
covered
with
wounds
but
he
opened
his
eyes
and
something
like
a
smile
came
upon
his
lips
a
smile
i
had
heard
laughter
and
seen
ridicule
and
derision
but
this
i
had
not
seen
i
could
not
bear
it
to
seize
him
and
shake
the
little
remaining
life
out
of
him
was
my
impulse
but
neither
did
i
obey
that
again
he
reminded
me
of
my
dream
was
it
a
dream
of
the
opening
in
the
clouds
from
that
moment
i
tried
to
shelter
him
and
as
i
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
pushed
my
way
to
the
door
i
dragged
him
along
with
me
how
long
the
struggle
was
i
can
not
tell
or
how
often
i
was
balked
or
how
many
darted
through
before
me
when
the
door
was
opened
but
i
did
not
let
him
go
and
at
last
for
now
i
was
as
strong
as
before
stronger
than
most
about
me
i
got
out
into
the
air
and
brought
him
with
me
into
the
air
it
was
an
atmosphere
so
still
and
motionless
that
there
was
no
feeling
of
life
in
it
as
i
have
said
but
the
change
seemed
to
me
happiness
for
the
moment
it
was
freedom
the
noise
of
the
struggle
was
over
the
horrible
sights
were
left
behind
my
spirit
sprang
up
as
if
i
had
been
born
into
new
life
it
had
the
same
effect
i
suppose
upon
my
companion
though
he
was
much
weaker
than
i
for
he
rose
to
his
feet
at
once
with
almost
a
leap
of
eagerness
and
turned
instantaneously
towards
the
other
side
of
the
city
that
way
i
said
with
me
and
rest
rest
no
rest
my
rest
is
to
go
on
and
then
he
turned
towards
me
and
smiled
and
said
looking
into
my
face
what
a
word
to
hear
i
had
not
heard
it
since
a
rush
of
strange
and
sweet
and
dreadful
thoughts
came
into
my
mind
i
shrank
and
trembled
and
let
go
his
arm
which
i
had
been
holding
but
when
i
left
that
hold
i
seemed
to
fall
back
into
depths
of
blank
pain
and
longing
i
put
out
my
hand
again
and
caught
him
will
go
i
said
you
go
a
pair
of
the
officials
of
the
place
passed
as
i
spoke
they
looked
at
me
with
a
threatening
glance
and
half
paused
but
then
passed
on
it
was
i
now
who
hurried
my
companion
along
i
recollected
him
now
he
was
a
man
who
had
met
me
in
the
streets
of
the
other
city
when
i
was
still
ignorant
who
had
convulsed
me
with
the
utterance
of
that
name
which
in
all
this
world
where
we
were
is
never
named
but
for
punishment
the
name
which
i
had
named
once
more
in
the
great
hall
in
the
midst
of
my
torture
so
that
all
who
heard
me
were
transfixed
with
that
suffering
too
he
had
been
haggard
then
but
he
was
more
haggard
now
his
features
were
sharp
with
continual
pain
his
eyes
were
wild
with
weakness
and
trouble
though
there
was
a
meaning
in
them
which
went
to
my
heart
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
his
touch
there
was
a
certain
help
though
he
was
weak
and
tottered
and
every
moment
seemed
full
of
suffering
hope
sprang
up
in
my
mind
the
hope
that
where
he
was
so
eager
to
go
there
would
be
something
better
a
life
more
livable
than
in
this
place
in
every
new
place
there
is
new
hope
i
was
not
worn
out
of
that
human
impulse
i
forgot
the
nightmare
which
had
crushed
me
before
the
horrible
sense
that
from
myself
there
was
no
escape
and
holding
fast
to
his
arm
i
hurried
on
with
him
not
heeding
where
we
went
aside
into
less
frequented
streets
that
we
might
escape
observation
i
seemed
to
myself
the
guide
though
i
was
the
follower
a
great
faith
in
this
man
sprang
up
in
my
breast
i
was
ready
to
go
with
him
wherever
he
went
anywhere
anywhere
must
be
better
than
this
thus
i
pushed
him
on
holding
by
his
arm
till
we
reached
the
very
outmost
limits
of
the
city
here
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
turning
upon
me
and
took
me
by
the
hands
he
said
you
were
born
into
the
pleasant
earth
i
had
come
here
i
have
gone
all
the
weary
round
listen
to
one
who
knows
all
is
harder
harder
as
you
go
on
you
are
stirred
to
go
on
by
the
restlessness
in
your
heart
and
each
new
place
you
come
to
the
spirit
of
that
place
enters
into
you
you
are
better
here
than
you
will
be
farther
on
you
were
better
where
you
were
at
first
or
even
in
the
mines
than
here
come
no
farther
stay
unless
but
here
his
voice
gave
way
he
looked
at
me
with
anxiety
in
his
eyes
and
said
no
more
why
i
cried
you
go
on
why
do
you
not
stay
he
shook
his
head
and
his
eyes
grew
more
and
more
soft
am
going
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
again
am
going
to
try
the
most
awful
and
the
most
dangerous
journey
his
voice
died
away
altogether
and
he
only
looked
at
me
to
say
the
rest
journey
where
i
can
tell
no
man
what
his
eyes
said
i
understood
i
can
not
tell
how
and
with
trembling
all
my
limbs
seemed
to
drop
out
of
joint
and
my
face
grow
moist
with
terror
i
could
not
speak
any
more
than
he
but
with
my
lips
shaped
how
the
awful
thought
made
a
tremor
in
the
very
air
around
he
shook
his
head
slowly
as
he
looked
at
me
his
eyes
all
circled
with
deep
lines
looking
out
of
caves
of
anguish
and
anxiety
and
then
i
remembered
how
he
had
said
and
i
had
scoffed
at
him
that
the
way
he
sought
was
one
he
did
not
know
i
had
dropped
his
hands
in
my
fear
and
yet
to
leave
him
seemed
dragging
the
heart
out
of
my
breast
for
none
but
he
had
spoken
to
me
like
a
brother
had
taken
my
hand
and
thanked
me
i
looked
out
across
the
plain
and
the
roads
seemed
tranquil
and
still
there
was
a
coolness
in
the
air
it
looked
like
evening
as
if
somewhere
in
those
far
distances
there
might
be
a
place
where
a
weary
soul
might
rest
and
i
looked
behind
me
and
thought
what
i
had
suffered
and
remembered
the
and
the
voices
that
cried
and
the
hands
that
beat
against
the
door
and
also
the
horrible
quiet
of
the
room
in
which
i
lived
and
the
eyes
which
looked
in
at
me
and
turned
my
gaze
upon
myself
then
i
rushed
after
him
for
he
had
turned
to
go
on
upon
his
way
and
caught
at
his
clothes
crying
me
behold
me
i
will
go
too
he
reached
me
his
hand
and
went
on
without
a
word
and
i
with
terror
crept
after
him
treading
in
his
steps
following
like
his
shadow
what
it
was
to
walk
with
another
and
follow
and
be
at
one
is
more
than
i
can
tell
but
likewise
my
heart
failed
me
for
fear
for
dread
of
what
we
might
encounter
and
of
hearing
that
name
or
entering
that
presence
which
was
more
terrible
than
all
torture
i
wondered
how
it
could
be
that
one
should
willingly
face
which
racked
the
soul
and
how
he
had
learned
that
it
was
possible
and
where
he
had
heard
of
the
way
and
as
we
went
on
i
said
no
word
for
he
began
to
seem
to
me
a
being
of
another
kind
a
figure
full
of
awe
and
i
followed
as
one
might
follow
a
ghost
where
would
he
go
were
we
not
fixed
here
forever
where
our
lot
had
been
cast
and
there
were
still
many
other
great
cities
where
there
might
be
much
to
see
and
something
to
distract
the
mind
and
where
it
might
be
more
possible
to
live
than
it
had
proved
in
the
other
places
there
might
be
no
tyrants
there
nor
cruelty
nor
horrible
noises
nor
dreadful
silence
towards
the
right
hand
across
the
plain
there
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
gray
distance
a
cluster
of
towers
and
roofs
like
another
habitable
place
and
who
could
tell
that
something
better
might
not
be
there
surely
everything
could
not
turn
to
torture
and
misery
i
dragged
on
behind
him
with
all
these
thoughts
hurrying
through
my
mind
he
was
going
i
dare
to
say
it
now
though
i
did
not
dare
then
to
seek
out
a
way
to
god
to
try
if
it
was
possible
to
find
the
road
that
led
back
that
road
which
had
been
open
once
to
all
but
for
me
i
trembled
at
the
thought
of
that
road
i
feared
the
name
which
was
as
the
plunging
of
a
sword
into
my
inmost
parts
all
things
could
be
borne
but
that
i
dared
not
even
think
upon
that
name
to
feel
my
hand
in
another
hand
was
much
but
to
be
led
into
that
awful
presence
by
awful
ways
which
none
knew
how
could
i
bear
it
my
spirits
failed
me
and
my
strength
my
hand
became
loose
in
his
hand
he
grasped
me
still
but
my
hold
failed
and
ever
with
slower
and
slower
steps
i
followed
while
he
seemed
to
acquire
strength
with
every
winding
of
the
way
at
length
he
said
to
me
looking
back
upon
me
can
not
stop
but
your
heart
falls
you
shall
i
loose
my
hand
and
let
you
go
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
i
cried
i
too
am
afraid
but
it
is
better
to
suffer
more
and
to
escape
than
to
suffer
less
and
to
remain
it
ever
been
known
that
one
escaped
no
one
has
ever
escaped
this
is
our
place
i
said
is
no
other
world
are
other
worlds
there
is
a
world
where
every
way
leads
to
one
who
loves
us
still
i
cried
out
with
a
great
cry
of
misery
and
scorn
is
no
love
i
said
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
turned
and
looked
at
me
his
eyes
seemed
to
melt
my
soul
a
great
cloud
passed
over
them
as
in
the
pleasant
earth
a
cloud
will
sweep
across
the
moon
and
then
the
light
came
out
and
looked
at
me
again
for
neither
did
he
know
where
he
was
going
all
might
end
in
despair
and
double
and
double
pain
but
if
it
were
possible
that
at
the
end
there
should
be
found
that
for
which
he
longed
upon
which
his
heart
was
set
he
said
with
a
faltering
voice
all
whom
i
have
questioned
and
seen
there
was
but
one
who
found
the
way
but
if
one
has
found
it
so
may
i
if
you
will
not
come
yet
let
me
go
will
tear
you
limb
from
limb
they
will
burn
you
in
the
endless
fires
i
said
but
what
is
it
to
be
torn
limb
from
limb
or
burned
with
fire
there
came
upon
his
face
a
smile
and
in
my
heart
even
i
laughed
to
scorn
what
i
had
said
i
were
dragged
every
nerve
apart
and
every
thought
turned
into
a
fiery
dart
and
that
is
so
he
said
will
i
go
if
but
perhaps
i
may
see
love
at
the
end
is
no
love
i
cried
again
with
a
sharp
and
bitter
cry
and
the
echo
seemed
to
come
back
and
back
from
every
side
no
love
no
love
till
the
man
who
was
my
friend
faltered
and
stumbled
like
a
drunken
man
but
afterwards
he
recovered
strength
and
resumed
his
way
and
thus
once
more
we
went
on
on
the
right
hand
was
that
city
growing
ever
clearer
with
noble
towers
rising
up
to
the
sky
and
battlements
and
lofty
roofs
and
behind
a
yellow
clearness
as
of
a
golden
sunset
my
heart
drew
me
there
it
sprang
up
in
my
breast
and
sang
in
my
ears
come
and
come
myself
invited
me
to
this
new
place
as
to
a
home
the
others
were
wretched
but
this
will
be
happy
delights
and
pleasures
will
be
there
and
before
us
the
way
grew
dark
with
storms
and
there
grew
visible
among
the
mists
a
black
line
of
mountains
perpendicular
cliffs
and
awful
precipices
which
seemed
to
bar
the
way
i
turned
from
that
line
of
gloomy
heights
and
gazed
along
the
path
to
where
the
towers
stood
up
against
the
sky
and
presently
my
hand
dropped
by
my
side
that
had
been
held
in
my
companion
hand
and
i
saw
him
no
more
i
went
on
to
the
city
of
the
evening
light
ever
and
ever
as
i
proceeded
on
my
way
the
sense
of
haste
and
restless
impatience
grew
upon
me
so
that
i
felt
myself
incapable
of
remaining
long
in
a
place
and
my
desire
grew
stronger
to
hasten
on
and
on
but
when
i
entered
the
gates
of
the
city
this
longing
vanished
from
my
mind
there
seemed
some
great
festival
or
public
holiday
going
on
there
the
streets
were
full
of
and
in
every
open
place
of
which
there
were
many
were
bands
of
dancers
and
music
playing
and
the
houses
about
were
hung
with
tapestries
and
embroideries
and
garlands
of
flowers
a
load
seemed
to
be
taken
from
my
spirit
when
i
saw
all
this
for
a
whole
population
does
not
rejoice
in
such
a
way
without
some
cause
and
to
think
that
after
all
i
had
found
a
place
in
which
i
might
live
and
forget
the
misery
and
pain
which
i
had
known
and
all
that
was
behind
me
was
delightful
to
my
soul
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
the
dancers
were
beautiful
and
young
their
steps
went
gayly
to
the
music
their
faces
were
bright
with
smiles
here
and
there
was
a
master
of
the
feast
who
arranged
the
dances
and
guided
the
musicians
yet
seemed
to
have
a
look
and
smile
for
too
one
of
these
came
forwards
to
meet
me
and
received
me
with
a
welcome
and
showed
me
a
vacant
place
at
the
table
on
which
were
beautiful
fruits
piled
up
in
baskets
and
all
the
provisions
for
a
meal
were
expected
you
perceive
he
said
a
delightful
sense
of
came
into
my
mind
i
sat
down
in
the
sweetness
of
ease
after
fatigue
of
refreshment
after
weariness
of
pleasant
sounds
and
sights
after
the
arid
way
i
said
to
myself
that
my
past
experiences
had
been
a
mistake
that
this
was
where
i
ought
to
have
come
from
the
first
that
life
here
would
be
happy
and
that
all
intruding
thoughts
must
soon
vanish
and
die
away
after
i
had
rested
i
strolled
about
and
entered
fully
into
the
pleasures
of
the
place
wherever
i
went
through
all
the
city
there
was
nothing
but
brightness
and
pleasure
music
playing
and
flags
waving
and
flowers
and
dancers
and
everything
that
was
most
gay
i
asked
several
people
whom
i
met
what
was
the
cause
of
the
rejoicing
but
either
they
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
own
pleasures
or
my
question
was
lost
in
the
hum
of
merriment
the
sound
of
the
instruments
and
of
the
feet
when
i
had
seen
as
much
as
i
desired
of
the
pleasure
out
of
doors
i
was
taken
by
some
to
see
the
interiors
of
houses
which
were
all
decorated
for
this
festival
whatever
it
was
lighted
up
with
curious
varieties
of
lighting
in
tints
of
different
colors
the
doors
and
windows
were
all
open
and
whosoever
would
could
come
in
from
the
dance
or
from
the
laden
tables
and
sit
down
where
they
pleased
and
rest
always
with
a
pleasant
view
out
upon
the
streets
so
that
they
should
lose
nothing
of
the
spectacle
and
the
dresses
both
of
women
and
men
were
beautiful
in
form
and
color
made
in
the
finest
fabrics
and
affording
delightful
combinations
to
the
eye
the
pleasure
which
i
took
in
all
i
saw
and
heard
was
enhanced
by
the
surprise
of
it
and
by
the
aspect
of
the
places
from
which
i
had
come
where
there
was
no
regard
to
beauty
nor
anything
lovely
or
bright
before
my
arrival
here
i
had
come
in
my
thoughts
to
the
conclusion
that
life
had
no
brightness
in
these
regions
and
that
whatever
occupation
or
study
there
might
be
pleasure
had
ended
and
was
over
and
everything
that
had
been
sweet
in
the
former
life
i
changed
that
opinion
with
a
sense
of
relief
which
was
more
warm
even
than
the
pleasure
of
the
present
moment
for
having
made
one
such
mistake
how
could
i
tell
that
there
were
not
more
discoveries
awaiting
me
that
life
might
not
prove
more
endurable
might
not
rise
to
something
grander
and
more
powerful
the
old
prejudices
the
old
foregone
conclusion
of
earth
that
this
was
a
world
of
punishment
had
warped
my
vision
and
my
thoughts
with
so
many
added
faculties
of
being
incapable
of
fatigue
as
we
were
incapable
of
death
recovering
from
every
wound
or
accident
as
i
had
myself
done
and
with
no
foolish
restraint
as
to
what
we
should
or
should
not
do
why
might
not
we
rise
in
this
land
to
strength
unexampled
to
the
highest
powers
i
rejoiced
that
i
had
dropped
my
companion
hand
that
i
had
not
followed
him
in
his
mad
quest
sometime
i
said
to
myself
i
would
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
foot
of
those
gloomy
mountains
and
bring
him
back
all
racked
and
tortured
as
he
was
and
show
him
the
pleasant
place
which
he
had
missed
in
the
mean
time
the
music
and
the
dance
went
on
but
it
began
to
surprise
me
a
little
that
there
was
no
pause
that
the
festival
continued
without
intermission
i
went
up
to
one
of
those
who
seemed
the
masters
of
ceremony
directing
what
was
going
on
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
flowing
robe
of
brocade
and
a
chain
and
badge
which
denoted
his
office
he
stood
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
beating
time
with
his
hand
to
the
music
watching
the
figure
of
the
dance
can
get
no
one
to
tell
me
i
said
the
occasion
of
all
this
rejoicing
is
is
for
your
coming
he
replied
without
hesitation
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
for
the
moment
a
wonderful
elation
came
over
me
my
coming
but
then
i
paused
and
shook
my
head
are
others
coming
besides
me
see
they
arrive
every
moment
is
for
their
coming
too
he
said
with
another
smile
and
a
still
deeper
bow
you
are
the
first
as
you
are
the
chief
this
was
what
i
could
not
understand
but
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
and
i
made
no
further
objection
how
long
will
it
go
on
i
said
long
as
it
pleases
you
said
the
old
courtier
how
he
smiled
his
smile
did
not
please
me
he
saw
this
and
distracted
my
attention
at
this
dance
he
said
beautiful
are
those
round
young
limbs
look
how
the
dress
conceals
yet
shows
the
form
and
beautiful
movements
it
was
invented
in
your
honor
all
that
is
lovely
is
for
you
choose
where
you
will
all
is
yours
we
live
only
for
this
all
is
for
you
while
he
spoke
the
dancers
came
nearer
and
nearer
till
they
circled
us
round
and
danced
and
made
their
pretty
obeisances
and
sang
is
yours
all
is
for
you
then
breaking
their
lines
floated
away
in
other
circles
and
processions
and
endless
groups
singing
and
laughing
till
it
seemed
to
ring
from
every
side
is
yours
all
is
for
you
i
accepted
this
flattery
i
know
not
why
for
i
soon
became
aware
that
i
was
no
more
than
others
and
that
the
same
words
were
said
to
every
yet
my
heart
was
elated
and
i
threw
myself
into
all
that
was
set
before
me
but
there
was
always
in
my
mind
an
expectation
that
presently
the
music
and
the
dancing
would
cease
and
the
tables
be
withdrawn
and
a
pause
come
at
one
of
the
feasts
i
was
placed
by
the
side
of
a
lady
very
fair
and
richly
dressed
but
with
a
look
of
great
weariness
in
her
eyes
she
turned
her
beautiful
face
to
me
not
with
any
show
of
pleasure
and
there
was
something
like
compassion
in
her
look
she
said
are
very
tired
as
she
made
room
for
me
by
her
side
i
said
though
with
surprise
for
i
had
not
yet
acknowledged
that
even
to
myself
is
so
much
to
enjoy
we
have
need
of
a
little
rest
rest
said
she
shaking
her
head
is
not
the
place
for
rest
pleasure
requires
it
i
said
much
as
i
was
about
to
say
pain
but
why
should
one
speak
of
pain
in
a
place
given
up
to
pleasure
she
smiled
faintly
and
shook
her
head
again
all
her
movements
were
languid
and
faint
her
eyelids
drooped
over
her
eyes
yet
when
i
turned
to
her
she
made
an
effort
to
smile
think
you
are
also
tired
i
said
at
this
she
roused
herself
a
little
must
not
say
so
nor
do
i
say
so
pleasure
is
very
exacting
it
demands
more
of
you
than
anything
else
one
must
be
always
ready
what
give
enjoyment
and
to
receive
it
there
was
an
effort
in
her
voice
to
rise
to
this
sentiment
but
it
fell
back
into
weariness
again
hope
you
receive
as
well
as
give
i
said
the
lady
turned
her
eyes
to
me
with
a
look
which
i
can
not
forget
and
life
seemed
once
more
to
be
roused
within
her
but
not
the
life
of
pleasure
her
eyes
were
full
of
loathing
and
fatigue
and
disgust
and
despair
you
so
new
to
this
place
she
said
have
not
learned
even
yet
what
is
the
height
of
all
misery
and
all
weariness
what
is
worse
than
pain
and
trouble
more
dreadful
than
the
lawless
streets
and
the
burning
mines
and
the
torture
of
the
great
hall
and
the
misery
of
the
lady
i
said
you
been
there
she
answered
me
with
her
eyes
alone
there
was
no
need
of
more
pleasure
is
more
terrible
than
all
she
said
and
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
what
she
said
was
true
there
is
no
record
of
time
in
that
place
i
could
not
count
it
by
days
or
nights
but
soon
after
this
it
happened
to
me
that
the
dances
and
the
music
became
no
more
than
a
dizzy
maze
of
sound
and
sight
which
made
my
brain
whirl
round
and
round
and
i
too
loathed
what
was
spread
on
the
table
and
the
soft
couches
and
the
garlands
and
the
fluttering
flags
and
ornaments
to
sit
forever
at
a
feast
to
see
forever
the
merrymakers
turn
round
and
round
to
hear
in
your
ears
forever
the
whirl
of
the
music
the
laughter
the
cries
of
pleasure
there
were
some
who
went
on
and
on
and
never
seemed
to
tire
but
to
me
the
endless
round
came
at
last
to
be
a
torture
from
which
i
could
not
escape
finally
i
could
distinguish
nothing
neither
what
i
heard
nor
what
i
saw
and
only
a
consciousness
of
something
intolerable
buzzed
and
echoed
in
my
brain
i
longed
for
the
quiet
of
the
place
i
had
left
i
longed
for
the
noise
in
the
streets
and
the
hubbub
and
tumult
of
my
first
experiences
anything
anything
rather
than
this
i
said
to
myself
and
still
the
dancers
turned
the
music
sounded
the
bystanders
smiled
and
everything
went
on
and
on
my
eyes
grew
weary
with
seeing
and
my
ears
with
hearing
to
watch
the
rush
in
all
pleased
and
eager
to
see
the
eyes
of
the
others
glaze
with
weariness
wrought
upon
my
strained
nerves
i
could
not
think
i
could
not
rest
i
could
not
endure
music
forever
and
ever
a
whirl
a
rush
of
music
always
going
on
and
on
and
ever
that
maze
of
movement
till
the
eyes
were
feverish
and
the
mouth
parched
ever
that
mist
of
faces
now
one
gleaming
out
of
the
chaos
now
another
some
like
the
faces
of
angels
some
miserable
weary
strained
with
smiling
with
the
monotony
and
the
endless
aimless
round
i
heard
myself
calling
to
them
to
be
still
to
be
still
to
pause
a
moment
i
felt
myself
stumble
and
turn
round
in
the
giddiness
and
horror
of
that
movement
without
repose
and
finally
i
fell
under
the
feet
of
the
crowd
and
felt
the
whirl
go
over
and
over
me
and
beat
upon
my
brain
until
i
was
pushed
and
thrust
out
of
the
way
lest
i
should
stop
the
measure
there
i
lay
sick
satiate
for
i
know
not
how
long
loathing
everything
around
me
ready
to
give
all
i
had
but
what
had
i
to
give
for
one
moment
of
silence
but
always
the
music
went
on
and
the
dancers
danced
and
the
people
feasted
and
the
songs
and
the
voices
echoed
up
to
the
skies
how
at
last
i
stumbled
forth
i
can
not
tell
desperation
must
have
moved
me
and
that
impatience
which
after
every
hope
and
disappointment
comes
back
and
back
the
one
sensation
that
never
fails
i
dragged
myself
at
last
by
intervals
like
a
sick
dog
outside
the
revels
still
hearing
them
which
was
torture
to
me
even
when
at
last
i
got
beyond
the
crowd
it
was
something
to
lie
still
upon
the
ground
though
without
power
to
move
and
sick
beyond
all
thought
loathing
myself
and
all
that
i
had
been
and
seen
for
i
had
not
even
the
sense
that
i
had
been
wronged
to
keep
me
up
but
only
a
nausea
and
horror
of
movement
a
giddiness
and
whirl
of
every
sense
i
lay
like
a
log
upon
the
ground
when
i
recovered
my
faculties
a
little
it
was
to
find
myself
once
more
in
the
great
vacant
plain
which
surrounded
that
accursed
home
of
pleasure
a
great
and
desolate
waste
upon
which
i
could
see
no
track
which
my
heart
fainted
to
look
at
which
no
longer
roused
any
hope
in
me
as
if
it
might
lead
to
another
beginning
or
any
place
in
which
yet
at
the
last
it
might
be
possible
to
live
as
i
lay
in
that
horrible
giddiness
and
faintness
i
loathed
life
and
this
continuance
which
brought
me
through
one
misery
after
another
and
forbade
me
to
die
oh
that
death
would
come
death
which
is
silent
and
still
which
makes
no
movement
and
hears
no
sound
that
i
might
end
and
be
no
more
oh
that
i
could
go
back
even
to
the
stillness
of
that
chamber
which
i
had
not
been
able
to
endure
oh
that
i
could
return
return
to
what
to
other
miseries
and
other
pain
which
looked
less
because
they
were
past
but
i
knew
now
that
return
was
impossible
until
i
had
circled
all
the
dreadful
round
and
already
i
felt
again
the
burning
of
that
desire
that
pricked
and
drove
me
on
not
back
for
that
was
impossible
little
by
little
i
had
learned
to
understand
each
step
printed
upon
my
brain
as
with
irons
not
back
but
on
and
on
to
greater
anguish
yes
but
on
to
fuller
despair
to
experiences
more
terrible
but
on
and
on
and
on
i
arose
again
for
this
was
my
fate
i
could
not
pause
even
for
all
the
teachings
of
despair
the
waste
stretched
far
as
eyes
could
see
it
was
wild
and
terrible
with
neither
vegetation
nor
sign
of
life
here
and
there
were
heaps
of
ruin
which
had
been
villages
and
cities
but
nothing
was
in
them
save
reptiles
and
crawling
poisonous
life
and
traps
for
the
unwary
wanderer
how
often
i
stumbled
and
fell
among
these
ashes
and
of
the
past
through
what
dread
moments
i
lay
with
cold
and
slimy
things
leaving
their
trace
upon
my
flesh
the
horrors
which
seized
me
so
that
i
beat
my
head
against
a
stone
why
should
i
tell
these
were
nought
they
touched
not
the
soul
they
were
but
accidents
of
the
way
at
length
when
body
and
soul
were
low
and
worn
out
with
misery
and
weariness
i
came
to
another
place
where
all
was
so
different
from
the
last
that
the
sight
gave
me
a
momentary
solace
it
was
full
of
furnaces
and
clanking
machinery
and
endless
work
the
whole
air
round
was
aglow
with
the
fury
of
the
fires
and
men
went
and
came
like
demons
in
the
flames
with
melting
metal
pouring
it
into
moulds
and
beating
it
on
anvils
in
the
huge
workshops
in
the
background
there
was
a
perpetual
whir
of
machinery
of
wheels
turning
and
turning
and
pistons
beating
and
all
the
din
of
labor
which
for
a
time
renewed
the
anguish
of
my
brain
yet
also
soothed
it
for
there
was
meaning
in
the
beatings
and
the
whirlings
and
a
hope
rose
within
me
that
with
all
the
forces
that
were
here
some
revolution
might
be
possible
something
that
would
change
the
features
of
this
place
and
overturn
the
worlds
i
went
from
workshop
to
workshop
and
examined
all
that
was
being
done
and
understood
for
i
had
known
a
little
upon
the
earth
and
my
old
knowledge
came
back
and
to
learn
so
much
more
filled
me
with
new
life
the
master
of
all
was
one
who
never
rested
nor
seemed
to
feel
weariness
nor
pain
nor
pleasure
he
had
everything
in
his
hand
all
who
were
there
were
his
workmen
or
his
assistants
or
his
servants
no
one
shared
with
him
in
his
councils
he
was
more
than
a
prince
among
them
he
was
as
a
god
and
the
things
he
planned
and
made
and
at
which
in
armies
and
legions
his
workmen
toiled
and
labored
were
like
living
things
they
were
made
of
steel
and
iron
but
they
moved
like
the
brains
and
nerves
of
men
they
went
where
he
directed
them
and
did
what
he
commanded
and
moved
at
a
touch
and
though
he
talked
little
when
he
saw
how
i
followed
all
that
he
did
he
was
a
little
moved
towards
me
and
spoke
and
explained
to
me
the
conceptions
that
were
in
his
mind
one
rising
out
of
another
like
the
leaf
out
of
the
stem
and
the
flower
out
of
the
bud
for
nothing
pleased
him
that
he
did
and
necessity
was
upon
him
to
go
on
and
on
are
like
living
things
i
said
do
your
bidding
whatever
you
command
them
they
are
like
another
and
a
stronger
race
of
men
he
said
are
men
the
most
contemptible
of
all
things
that
are
made
creatures
who
will
undo
in
a
moment
what
it
has
taken
millions
of
years
and
all
the
skill
and
all
the
strength
of
generations
to
do
these
are
better
than
men
they
can
not
think
or
feel
they
can
not
stop
but
at
my
bidding
or
begin
unless
i
will
had
men
been
made
so
we
should
be
masters
of
the
world
men
been
made
so
you
would
never
have
been
for
what
could
genius
have
done
or
thought
you
would
have
been
a
machine
like
all
the
rest
better
so
he
said
and
turned
away
for
at
that
moment
watching
keenly
as
he
spoke
the
action
of
a
delicate
combination
of
movements
all
made
and
balanced
to
a
hair
breadth
there
had
come
to
him
suddenly
the
idea
of
something
which
made
it
a
hundredfold
more
strong
and
terrible
for
they
were
terrible
these
things
that
lived
yet
did
not
live
which
were
his
slaves
and
moved
at
his
will
when
he
had
done
this
he
looked
at
me
and
a
smile
came
upon
his
mouth
but
his
eyes
smiled
not
nor
ever
changed
from
the
set
look
they
wore
and
the
words
he
spoke
were
familiar
words
not
his
but
out
of
the
old
life
a
piece
of
work
is
a
man
he
said
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculty
in
form
and
moving
how
express
and
admirable
and
yet
to
me
what
is
this
quintessence
of
dust
his
mind
had
followed
another
strain
of
thought
which
to
me
was
bewildering
so
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
reply
i
answered
like
a
child
upon
his
last
word
are
dust
no
more
i
cried
for
pride
was
in
my
heart
pride
of
him
and
his
wonderful
strength
and
his
thoughts
which
created
strength
and
all
the
marvels
he
did
things
which
hindered
are
removed
go
on
go
on
you
want
but
another
step
what
is
to
prevent
that
you
should
not
shake
the
universe
and
overturn
this
doom
and
break
all
our
bonds
there
is
enough
here
to
explode
this
gray
fiction
of
a
firmament
and
to
rend
those
precipices
and
to
dissolve
that
waste
as
at
the
time
when
the
primeval
seas
dried
up
and
those
infernal
mountains
rose
he
laughed
and
the
echoes
caught
the
sound
and
gave
it
back
as
if
they
mocked
it
is
enough
to
rend
us
all
into
shreds
he
said
shake
as
you
say
both
heaven
and
earth
and
these
plains
and
those
hills
why
i
cried
in
my
haste
with
a
dreadful
hope
piercing
through
my
soul
do
you
create
and
perfect
but
never
employ
when
we
had
armies
on
the
earth
we
used
them
you
have
more
than
armies
you
have
force
beyond
the
thoughts
of
man
but
all
without
use
as
yet
he
cried
no
use
all
in
vain
in
vain
master
i
said
and
more
great
in
time
to
come
why
why
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
close
you
strength
he
said
bear
it
if
i
tell
you
why
i
knew
what
he
was
about
to
say
i
felt
it
in
the
quivering
of
my
veins
and
my
heart
that
bounded
as
if
it
would
escape
from
my
breast
but
i
would
not
quail
from
what
he
did
not
shrink
to
utter
i
could
speak
no
word
but
i
looked
him
in
the
face
and
waited
for
that
which
was
more
terrible
than
all
he
held
me
by
the
arm
as
if
he
would
hold
me
up
when
the
shock
of
anguish
came
are
in
vain
he
said
vain
because
god
rules
over
all
his
arm
was
strong
but
i
fell
at
his
feet
like
a
dead
man
how
miserable
is
that
image
and
how
unfit
to
use
death
is
still
and
cool
and
sweet
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
pierces
like
a
sword
that
burns
like
fire
that
rends
and
tears
like
the
turning
wheels
o
life
o
pain
o
terrible
name
of
god
in
which
is
all
succor
and
all
torment
what
are
pangs
and
tortures
to
that
which
ever
increases
in
its
awful
power
and
has
no
limit
nor
any
alleviation
but
whenever
it
is
spoken
penetrates
through
and
through
the
miserable
soul
o
god
whom
once
i
called
my
father
o
thou
who
gavest
me
being
against
whom
i
have
fought
whom
i
fight
to
the
end
shall
there
never
be
anything
but
anguish
in
the
sound
of
thy
great
name
when
i
returned
to
such
command
of
myself
as
one
can
have
who
has
been
transfixed
by
that
sword
of
fire
the
master
stood
by
me
still
he
had
not
fallen
like
me
but
his
face
was
drawn
with
anguish
and
sorrow
like
the
face
of
my
friend
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
who
had
disappeared
on
the
dark
mountains
and
as
i
looked
at
him
terror
seized
hold
upon
me
and
a
desire
to
flee
and
save
myself
that
i
might
not
be
drawn
after
him
by
the
longing
that
was
in
his
eyes
the
master
gave
me
his
hand
to
help
me
to
rise
and
it
trembled
but
not
like
mine
i
cried
not
we
enough
to
bear
is
it
for
hatred
is
it
for
vengeance
that
you
speak
that
name
friend
he
said
for
hatred
nor
revenge
it
is
like
a
fire
in
my
veins
if
one
could
find
him
again
who
are
as
a
god
who
can
make
and
destroy
you
who
could
shake
his
throne
he
put
up
his
hand
who
am
his
creature
even
here
and
still
his
child
though
i
am
so
far
so
far
he
caught
my
hand
in
his
and
pointed
with
the
other
trembling
your
eyes
are
more
clear
than
mine
for
they
are
not
anxious
like
mine
can
you
see
anything
upon
the
way
the
waste
lay
wild
before
us
dark
with
a
cloud
for
darkness
and
cloud
and
the
gloom
of
death
attended
upon
that
name
i
thought
in
his
great
genius
and
splendor
of
intellect
he
had
gone
mad
as
sometimes
may
be
is
nothing
i
said
and
scorn
came
into
my
soul
but
even
as
i
spoke
i
saw
i
can
not
tell
what
i
saw
a
moving
spot
of
milky
whiteness
in
that
dark
and
miserable
wilderness
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
no
bigger
than
a
flower
is
something
i
said
unwillingly
has
no
shape
nor
form
it
is
a
upon
some
bush
or
a
butterfly
blown
on
the
wind
are
neither
butterflies
nor
gossamers
here
for
yourself
then
i
cried
flinging
his
hand
from
me
i
was
angry
with
a
rage
which
had
no
cause
i
turned
from
him
though
i
loved
him
with
a
desire
to
kill
him
in
my
heart
and
hurriedly
took
the
other
way
the
waste
was
wild
but
rather
that
than
to
see
the
man
who
might
have
shaken
earth
and
hell
thus
turning
turning
to
madness
and
the
awful
journey
for
i
knew
what
in
his
heart
he
thought
and
i
knew
that
it
was
so
it
was
something
from
that
other
sphere
can
i
tell
you
what
a
child
perhaps
o
thought
that
wrings
the
heart
for
do
you
know
what
manner
of
thing
a
child
is
there
are
none
in
the
land
of
darkness
i
turned
my
back
upon
the
place
where
that
whiteness
was
on
on
across
the
waste
on
to
the
cities
of
the
night
on
far
away
from
maddening
thought
from
hope
that
is
torment
and
from
the
awful
name
the
above
narrative
though
it
is
necessary
to
a
full
understanding
of
the
experiences
of
the
little
pilgrim
in
the
unseen
does
not
belong
to
her
personal
story
in
any
way
but
is
drawn
from
the
archives
in
the
heavenly
city
where
all
the
records
of
the
human
race
are
laid
up
