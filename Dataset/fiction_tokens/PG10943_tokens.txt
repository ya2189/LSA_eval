i
miss

thorne
all
the
world
rubs
elbows
in
washington
outwardly
it
is
merely
a
city
of
evasion
of
conventionalities
sated
with
the
commonplace
pleasures
of
life
listless
blas√©
even
and
always
exquisitely
albeit
frigidly
courteous
but
beneath
the
still
suave
surface
strange
currents
play
at
cross
purposes
intrigue
is
endless
and
the
merciless
war
of
diplomacy
goes
on
unceasingly
occasionally
only
occasionally
a
bubble
comes
to
the
surface
and
when
it
bursts
the
echo
goes
crashing
around
the
earth
sometimes
a
dynasty
is
shaken
a
nation
trembles
a
ministry
topples
over
but
the
ripple
moves
and
all
is
placid
again
no
man
may
know
all
that
happens
there
for
then
he
would
be
diplomatic
master
of
the
world
there
is
plenty
of
red
blood
in
washington
remarked
a
jesting
legislative
once
upon
a
time
but
it
always
frozen
before
they
put
it
in
circulation
diplomatic
negotiations
are
conducted
in
the
but
long
before
that
the
fight
is
fought
down
cellar
the
diplomatists
meet
at
table
and
there
is
any
broken
crockery
but
you
can
always
tell
what
the
player
thinks
of
the
dealer
by
the
way
he
draws
three
cards
everybody
is
after
results
and
lots
of
monarchs
of
europe
sit
up
nights
polishing
their
crowns
waiting
for
word
from
washington
so
this
is
washington
and
here
at
dinner
are
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
all
the
nations
that
is
the
british
ambassador
that
elderly
man
and
this
is
the
french
ambassador
dapper
volatile
here
russia
highest
representative
wags
a
huge
blond
beard
and
yonder
is
the
phlegmatic
german
ambassador
scattered
around
the
table
brilliant
splotches
of
color
are
the
uniformed
envoys
of
the
orient
the
smaller
the
country
the
more
brilliant
the
splotch
it
is
a
state
dinner
to
be
followed
by
a
state
ball
and
they
are
all
present
the
italian
ambassador
count
di
rosini
was
trying
to
interpret
a
french
into
english
for
the
benefit
of
the
dainty
wife
of
the
chinese
minister
who
was
educated
at
radcliffe
when
a
servant
leaned
over
him
and
laid
a
sealed
envelope
beside
his
plate
the
count
glanced
around
at
the
servant
excused
himself
to
quong
li
wi
and
opened
the
envelope
inside
was
a
single
sheet
of
embassy
note
paper
and
a
terse
line
signed
by
his
secretary
a
lady
is
waiting
for
you
here
she
says
she
must
see
you
immediately
on
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
the
count
read
the
note
twice
with
wrinkled
brow
then
scribbled
on
it
in
pencil
impossible
tell
her
to
call
at
the
embassy
morning
at
ten
he
folded
the
note
handed
it
to
the
servant
and
resumed
his
conversation
with
wi
half
an
hour
later
the
same
servant
placed
a
second
sealed
envelope
beside
his
plate
recognizing
the
superscription
the
ambassador
impatiently
shoved
it
aside
intending
to
disregard
it
but
irritated
curiosity
finally
triumphed
and
he
opened
it
a
white
card
on
which
was
written
this
command
was
his
reward
it
is
necessary
that
you
come
to
the
embassy
at
once
there
was
no
signature
the
handwriting
was
unmistakably
that
of
a
woman
and
just
as
unmistakably
strange
to
him
he
frowned
a
little
as
he
stared
at
it
wonderingly
then
idly
turned
the
card
over
there
was
no
name
on
the
reverse
side
only
a
crest
evidently
the
count
recognized
this
for
his
impassive
face
reflected
surprise
for
an
instant
and
this
was
followed
by
a
keen
bewildered
interest
finally
he
arose
made
his
apologies
and
left
the
room
his
automobile
was
at
the
door
illustration
the
handwriting
was
unmistakably
that
of
a
woman
to
the
embassy
he
directed
the
chauffeur
and
within
five
minutes
he
was
there
his
secretary
met
him
in
the
hall
the
lady
is
waiting
in
your
office
he
explained
apologetically
i
gave
her
your
message
but
she
said
she
must
see
you
and
would
write
you
a
line
herself
i
sent
it
quite
correct
commented
the
ambassador
what
name
did
she
give
none
was
the
reply
she
said
none
was
necessary
the
ambassador
laid
aside
hat
and
coat
and
entered
his
office
with
a
slightly
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
standing
before
a
window
gazing
idly
out
into
the
night
was
a
young
woman
rather
tall
and
severely
gowned
in
some
rich
glistening
stuff
which
fell
away
sheerly
from
her
splendid
bare
shoulders
she
turned
and
he
found
himself
looking
into
a
pair
of
clear
eyes
frank
enough
and
yet
in
their
very
frankness
possessing
an
alluring
indefinable
subtlety
he
would
not
have
called
her
pretty
yet
her
smile
slight
as
it
was
was
singularly
charming
and
there
radiated
from
her
a
something
personality
perhaps
which
held
his
glance
he
bowed
low
and
closed
the
door
i
am
at
your
service
madam
he
said
in
a
tone
of
deep
respect
please
pardon
my
delay
in
coming
to
you
it
is
unfortunate
that
i
did
write
the
first
note
she
apologized
graciously
it
would
at
least
have
saved
a
little
time
you
have
the
card
he
produced
it
silently
crest
down
and
handed
it
to
her
she
struck
a
match
lighted
the
card
and
it
crumbled
up
in
her
gloved
hand
the
last
tiny
scrap
found
refuge
in
a
silver
tray
where
she
watched
it
burn
to
ashes
then
she
turned
to
the
ambassador
with
a
brilliant
smile
he
was
still
standing
the
dinner
is
over
yet
she
inquired
no
madam
not
for
another
hour
perhaps
then
there
no
harm
done
she
went
on
lightly
the
dinner
is
of
any
consequence
but
i
should
like
very
much
to
attend
the
ball
afterward
can
you
arrange
it
for
me
i
do
know
just
how
i
would
proceed
madam
the
ambassador
objected
diffidently
it
would
be
rather
unusual
difficult
i
may
say
and
but
surely
you
can
arrange
it
some
way
she
interrupted
demurely
the
highest
diplomatic
representative
of
a
great
nation
should
not
find
it
difficult
to
arrange
so
simple
a
matter
as
as
this
she
was
smiling
pardon
me
for
suggesting
it
madam
the
ambassador
persisted
courteously
but
anything
out
of
the
usual
attracts
attention
in
washington
i
dare
say
from
the
manner
of
your
appearance
that
you
would
not
care
to
attract
attention
to
yourself
she
regarded
him
with
an
enigmatic
smile
i
afraid
you
do
know
women
count
she
said
slowly
at
last
there
nothing
dearer
to
a
woman
heart
than
to
attract
attention
to
herself
she
laughed
a
throaty
silvery
note
that
was
charming
and
if
you
hesitate
now
then
why
i
am
going
to
ask
that
you
open
to
me
all
this
washington
world
this
brilliant
world
of
diplomatic
society
you
see
what
i
ask
now
is
simple
the
ambassador
was
respectfully
silent
and
deeply
thoughtful
for
a
time
there
was
perhaps
something
of
resentment
struggling
within
him
and
certainly
there
was
an
uneasy
feeling
of
rebellion
at
this
attempt
to
thrust
him
forward
against
all
precedent
your
requests
are
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
that
he
began
in
courteous
protestation
there
was
no
trace
of
impatience
in
the
woman
manner
she
was
still
smiling
it
is
necessary
that
i
attend
the
ball
she
explained
you
may
imagine
how
necessary
when
i
say
i
sailed
from
liverpool
six
days
ago
reaching
new
york
at
three
this
afternoon
and
at
four
i
was
on
my
way
here
i
have
been
here
less
than
one
hour
i
came
from
liverpool
especially
that
i
might
be
present
and
i
even
dressed
on
the
train
so
there
would
be
no
delay
now
do
you
see
the
necessity
of
it
diplomatic
procedure
is
along
grooves
and
the
diplomatist
who
steps
out
of
the
rut
for
an
instant
happens
upon
strange
and
unexpected
obstacles
knowing
this
the
ambassador
still
hesitated
the
woman
apparently
understood
i
had
hoped
that
this
would
not
be
necessary
she
remarked
and
she
produced
a
small
sealed
envelope
please
read
it
the
ambassador
received
the
envelope
with
uplifted
brows
opened
it
and
read
what
was
written
on
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
some
subtle
working
of
his
brain
brought
a
sudden
change
in
the
expression
of
his
face
there
was
wonder
in
it
and
amazement
and
more
than
these
again
he
bowed
low
i
am
at
your
service
madam
he
repeated
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
making
any
arrangements
that
are
necessary
again
i
beg
your
pardon
and
it
will
not
be
so
very
difficult
after
all
will
it
she
inquired
and
she
smiled
tauntingly
it
will
not
be
at
all
difficult
madam
the
ambassador
assured
her
gravely
i
shall
take
steps
at
once
to
have
an
invitation
issued
to
you
for
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
proceed
as
you
may
suggest
she
nodded
he
folded
the
note
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
and
returned
it
to
her
with
another
deep
bow
she
drew
her
skirts
about
her
and
sat
down
he
stood
it
will
be
necessary
for
your
name
to
appear
on
the
invitation
the
ambassador
went
on
to
explain
if
you
will
give
me
your
name
i
have
my
secretary
oh
yes
my
name
she
interrupted
gaily
why
count
you
embarrass
me
you
know
really
i
have
no
name
is
it
awkward
i
understand
perfectly
madam
responded
the
count
i
should
have
said
name
she
meditated
a
moment
well
say
miss
thorne
miss
isabel
thorne
she
suggested
at
last
that
will
do
very
nicely
do
you
think
very
nicely
miss
thorne
and
the
ambassador
bowed
again
please
excuse
me
a
moment
and
i
give
my
secretary
instructions
how
to
proceed
there
will
be
a
delay
of
a
few
minutes
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
for
a
minute
or
more
miss
thorne
sat
perfectly
still
gazing
at
the
blank
wooden
panels
then
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
again
in
the
distance
hazy
in
the
soft
night
the
dome
of
the
capitol
rose
mistily
over
to
the
right
was
the
congressional
library
and
out
there
where
the
lights
sparkled
lay
pennsylvania
avenue
a
thread
of
commerce
miss
thorne
saw
it
all
and
suddenly
stretched
out
her
arms
with
an
gesture
she
stood
so
for
a
minute
then
they
fell
beside
her
and
she
was
motionless
count
di
rosini
entered
everything
is
arranged
miss
thorne
he
announced
will
you
go
with
me
in
my
automobile
or
do
you
prefer
to
go
alone
i
go
alone
please
she
answered
after
a
moment
i
shall
be
there
about
eleven
the
ambassador
bowed
himself
out
and
so
miss
isabel
thorne
came
to
washington
ii
campbell
and
the
cable
just
as
it
is
one
man
business
to
manufacture
watches
and
another
man
business
to
peddle
so
it
was
campbell
business
to
know
things
he
was
a
human
card
index
a
governmental
ready
reference
posted
to
the
minute
and
backed
by
all
the
tremendous
resources
of
a
nation
from
the
little
office
in
the
secret
service
bureau
where
he
sat
day
after
day
radiating
threads
connected
with
the
huge
outer
world
and
enabled
him
to
keep
a
firm
hand
on
the
diplomatic
and
departmental
pulse
of
washington
perhaps
he
came
nearer
knowing
everything
that
happened
there
than
any
other
man
living
and
no
man
realized
more
perfectly
than
he
just
how
little
of
all
of
it
he
did
know
in
person
campbell
was
not
unlike
a
retired
grocer
who
had
shaken
the
butter
and
eggs
from
his
soul
and
settled
back
to
enjoy
a
life
of
placid
idleness
he
was
a
little
beyond
middle
age
pleasant
of
face
white
of
hair
and
blessed
with
guileless
blue
eyes
his
genius
had
no
sparkle
to
it
it
consisted
solely
of
detail
and
system
and
indefatigability
coupled
with
a
memory
that
was
well
nigh
infallible
his
brain
was
as
serene
and
orderly
as
a
cash
register
one
almost
expected
to
hear
it
click
he
sat
at
his
desk
intently
studying
a
cable
despatch
which
lay
before
him
it
was
in
the
secret
service
code
leaning
over
his
shoulder
was
grimm
grimm
of
the
bureau
grimm
was
an
utterly
different
type
from
his
chief
he
was
younger
perhaps
or
two
physically
well
proportioned
a
little
above
the
average
height
with
regular
features
and
listless
purposeless
eyes
a
replica
of
a
hundred
other
young
men
who
dawdle
idly
in
the
windows
of
their
clubs
and
watch
the
world
hurry
by
his
manner
was
languid
his
dress
showed
fastidious
care
sentence
by
sentence
the
bewildering
intricacies
of
the
code
gave
way
before
the
placid
understanding
of
chief
campbell
and
word
by
word
from
the
chaos
of
it
a
translation
took
intelligible
form
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
under
his
right
hand
grimm
looking
on
exhibited
only
a
most
perfunctory
interest
in
the
extraordinary
message
he
was
reading
the
listless
eyes
narrowed
a
little
that
was
all
it
was
a
special
despatch
from
lisbon
dated
that
morning
and
signed
simply
gault
completely
translated
it
ran
thus

inform

instructions
so
much
commented
campbell
he
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
sat
for
a
long
time
staring
with
steadfast
thoughtful
eyes
into
the
impassive
face
of
his
subordinate
grimm
perched
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
and
with
his
legs
dangling
read
the
despatch
a
second
time
and
a
third
if
he
observed
slowly
if
any
other
man
than
gault
had
sent
that
i
should
have
said
he
was
crazy
the
peace
of
the
world
is
in
peril
grimm
said
campbell
impressively
at
last
it
had
to
come
of
course
the
united
states
and
england
against
a
large
part
of
europe
and
all
of
central
and
south
america
it
had
to
come
and
yet
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
picked
up
the
receiver
of
his
desk
telephone
the
white
house
please
he
requested
curtly
and
then
after
a
moment
hello
please
ask
the
president
if
he
will
receive
campbell
immediately
yes
campbell
of
the
secret
service
there
was
a
pause
grimm
removed
his
immaculate
person
from
the
desk
and
took
a
chair
hello
in
half
an
hour
so
much
the
pages
of
the
almanac
de
gotha
fluttered
through
his
fingers
and
finally
he
leaned
forward
and
studied
a
paragraph
of
it
closely
when
he
raised
his
eyes
again
there
was
that
in
them
which
grimm
had
never
seen
before
a
settled
darkening
shadow
the
has
long
been
a
chimera
grimm
he
remarked
at
last
but
now
now
think
of
it
of
course
the
central
and
south
american
countries
taken
separately
are
inconsequential
and
that
is
true
too
of
the
latin
countries
of
europe
except
france
but
taken
in
combination
under
one
directing
mind
the
allied
navies
would
be
would
be
formidable
at
least
backed
by
the
moral
support
of
germany
and
perhaps
japan
do
you
see
do
you
see
he
lapsed
into
silence
grimm
opened
his
lips
to
ask
a
question
campbell
anticipated
it
unerringly
the
purpose
of
such
an
alliance
it
is
not
too
much
to
construe
it
into
the
first
step
toward
a
a
war
of
reprisal
and
conquest
beside
which
the
other
great
wars
of
the
world
would
seem
trivial
for
the
fact
has
at
last
come
home
to
the
nations
of
the
world
that
ultimately
the
peoples
will
dominate
it
dominate
it
because
they
are
the
practical
peoples
they
have
given
to
the
world
all
its
great
practical
inventions
the
railroad
the
steamship
electricity
the
telegraph
and
cable
all
of
them
they
are
the
great
civilizing
forces
rounding
the
world
up
to
new
moral
understanding
for
what
england
has
done
in
africa
and
india
we
have
done
in
a
smaller
way
in
the
philippines
and
cuba
and
porto
rico
they
are
the
great
commercial
peoples
slowly
but
surely
winning
the
of
the
earth
wherever
the
english
or
the
american
flag
is
planted
there
the
english
tongue
is
being
spoken
and
there
the
peoples
are
being
taught
the
sanity
of
right
living
and
square
dealing
it
requires
no
great
effort
of
the
imagination
grimm
to
foresee
that
day
when
the
traditional
power
of
paris
and
berlin
and
petersburg
and
madrid
will
be
by
the
steady
encroachment
of
our
methods
this
alliance
would
indicate
that
already
that
day
has
been
foreseen
that
there
is
now
a
resentment
which
is
about
to
find
expression
in
one
great
desperate
struggle
for
world
supremacy
a
few
hundred
years
ago
italy
or
rome
was
stripped
of
her
power
only
recently
the
united
states
dispelled
the
illusion
that
spain
was
anything
but
a
shell
and
france
one
ca
help
but
wonder
if
the
power
she
boasts
is
not
principally
on
paper
but
if
their
forces
are
combined
do
you
see
it
would
be
an
enormous
power
to
reckon
with
with
a
hundred
bases
of
supplies
right
at
our
doors
he
rose
suddenly
and
walked
over
to
the
window
where
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
out
with
unseeing
eyes
given
a
yard
of
canvas
grimm
he
went
on
finally
a
spanish
boy
will
waste
it
a
french
boy
will
paint
a
picture
on
it
an
english
boy
will
built
a
and
an
american
boy
will
erect
a
tent
that
fully
illustrates
the
difference
in
the
races
he
abandoned
the
didactic
tone
and
returned
to
the
material
matter
in
hand
grimm
passed
him
the
despatch
and
he
sat
down
again
soon
sign
compact
in
washington
he
read
musingly
now
i
know
that
the
signing
of
that
compact
can
be
prevented
but
the
signing
of
it
on
united
states
soil
can
be
prevented
you
will
see
to
that
mr
grimm
very
well
the
young
man
agreed
carelessly
the
magnitude
of
such
a
task
made
apparently
not
the
slightest
impression
on
him
he
languidly
drew
on
his
gloves
and
meanwhile
i
shall
take
steps
to
ascertain
the
attitude
of
russian
and
japanese
representatives
in
this
city
grimm
nodded
and
now
for
prince
benedetto
campbell
went
on
slowly
officially
he
is
not
in
washington
nor
the
united
states
for
that
matter
naturally
on
such
a
mission
he
would
not
come
as
a
publicly
accredited
agent
therefore
i
imagine
he
is
to
be
sought
under
another
name
of
course
grimm
acquiesced
and
he
would
avoid
the
big
hotels
certainly
campbell
permitted
his
guileless
blue
eyes
to
linger
inquiringly
upon
those
of
the
young
man
for
half
a
minute
he
caught
himself
wondering
sometimes
at
the
perfection
of
the
deliberate
indifference
with
which
grimm
masked
his
emotions
in
his
admiration
of
this
quality
he
quite
overlooked
the
remarkable
mask
of
benevolence
behind
which
he
himself
hid
and
the
name
he
remarked
after
a
time
what
does
it
mean
to
you
mr
grimm
it
means
that
i
am
to
deal
with
a
prince
of
the
royal
blood
of
italy
was
the
unhesitating
response
grimm
picked
up
the
almanac
de
gotha
and
glanced
at
the
open
page
of
course
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
him
the
rest
will
be
simple
enough
he
perused
the
page
carelessly
i
will
begin
work
at
once
iii
the
language
of
the
fan
grimm
was
chatting
idly
with
se√±orita
rodriguez
daughter
of
the
minister
from
venezuela
the
while
he
permitted
his
listless
eyes
to
wander
aimlessly
about
the
spacious
of
the
german
embassy
ablaze
with
festooned
lights
and
brilliant
with
a
chaos
of
uniforms
gleaming
translucent
in
the
mass
were
the
bare
shoulders
of
women
and
from
far
off
came
the
plaintive
whine
of
an
orchestra
a
pulsing
sense
rather
than
a
living
sound
of
music
pointed
here
and
there
by
the
staccato
cry
of
a
flute
a
zephyr
perfumed
with
the
clean
fresh
odor
of
lilacs
stirred
the
draperies
of
the
archway
which
led
into
the
conservatory
and
rustled
the
bending
branches
of
palms
and
ferns
for
a
scant
instant
grimm
eyes
rested
on
a
young
woman
who
sat
a
dozen
feet
away
talking
in
playful
animation
with
an
undersecretary
of
the
british
embassy
a
young
woman
severely
gowned
in
some
glistening
stuff
which
fell
away
sheerly
from
her
splendid
bare
shoulders
she
glanced
up
as
if
in
acknowledgment
of
his
look
and
her
eyes
met
his
frank
eyes
they
were
stirred
to
their
depths
now
by
amusement
she
smiled
at
se√±orita
rodriguez
in
token
of
recognition
are
they
wonderful
asked
se√±orita
rodriguez
with
the
quick
bubbling
enthusiasm
of
her
race
what
asked
grimm
her
eyes
was
the
reply
every
person
has
one
dominant
feature
with
miss
thorne
it
is
her
eyes
miss
thorne
grimm
repeated
have
you
met
her
the
se√±orita
went
on
miss
isabel
thorne
she
only
arrived
a
few
days
ago
the
night
of
the
state
ball
she
my
guest
at
the
legation
when
an
opportunity
comes
i
shall
present
you
to
her
she
ran
on
about
other
things
with
only
an
occasional
remark
from
grimm
who
was
thoughtfully
nursing
his
knee
somewhere
through
the
chatter
and
effervescent
gaiety
mingling
with
the
sound
of
the
pulsing
music
he
had
a
singular
impression
of
a
rhythmical
beat
an
indistinct
tattoo
noticeable
perhaps
only
because
of
its
monotony
after
a
moment
he
shot
a
quick
glance
at
miss
thorne
and
understood
it
was
the
tapping
of
an
exquisitely
wrought
ivory
fan
against
one
of
her
tapering
gloved
fingers
she
was
talking
and
smiling
said
the
fan
grimm
twisted
around
in
his
seat
and
regaled
his
listless
eyes
with
a
long
stare
into
the
se√±orita
pretty
face
behind
the
careless
ease
of
repose
he
was
mechanically
isolating
the
faint
clatter
of
the
fan
did
any
one
ever
accuse
you
of
staring
mr
grimm
demanded
the
se√±orita
banteringly
for
an
instant
grimm
continued
to
stare
and
then
his
listless
eyes
swept
the
pausing
involuntarily
at
the
scarlet
splendor
of
the
minister
from
turkey
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologized
contritely
there
was
a
pause
the
minister
from
turkey
looks
like
a
barn
on
fire
does
he
se√±orita
rodriguez
laughed
and
grimm
glanced
idly
toward
miss
thorne
she
was
still
talking
her
face
alive
with
interest
and
the
fan
was
still
tapping
rhythmically
steadily
now
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
pretty
women
who
do
want
to
be
stared
at
should
go
with
their
faces
swathed
grimm
suggested
indolently
haroun
el
raschid
there
would
agree
with
me
on
that
point
i
have
no
doubt
what
a
shock
he
would
get
if
he
should
happen
up
at
atlantic
city
for
a
in
august
grimm
read
it
with
perfect
understanding
it
was
f
f
f
in
the
morse
code
the
call
of
one
operator
to
another
was
it
accident
grimm
wondered
and
wondering
he
went
on
talking
lazily
curious
is
it
the
smaller
the
nation
the
more
color
it
crowds
into
the
uniforms
of
its
diplomatists
the
british
ambassador
you
will
observe
is
clothed
sanely
and
modestly
as
befits
the
representative
of
a
great
nation
but
coming
on
down
by
way
of
spain
and
italy
they
get
more
gorgeous
however
i
dare
say
as
stout
a
heart
beats
beneath
a
sash
as
behind
the
unembellished
black
of
evening
dress
f
f
f
the
fan
was
calling
insistently
and
then
the
answer
came
it
took
the
unexpectedly
prosaic
form
of
a
violent
sneeze
a
vociferous
outburst
on
a
bench
directly
behind
grimm
se√±orita
rodriguez
jumped
then
laughed
nervously
it
startled
me
she
explained
i
think
there
must
be
a
draft
from
the
conservatory
said
a
voice
apologetically
do
you
ladies
feel
it
no
well
if
you
excuse
me
grimm
glanced
back
languidly
the
speaker
was
charles
winthrop
rankin
a
brilliant
young
american
lawyer
who
was
attached
to
the
german
embassy
in
an
advisory
capacity
among
other
things
he
was
a
heidelberg
man
having
spent
some
dozen
years
of
his
life
in
germany
where
he
established
influential
connections
grimm
knew
him
only
by
sight
and
now
the
rhythmical
tapping
of
miss
thorne
fan
underwent
a
change
there
was
a
flutter
of
gaiety
in
her
voice
the
while
the
ivory
fan
tapped
steadily
dash
dash
s
t
u
t
grimm
read
in
morse
he
laughed
pleasantly
at
some
remark
of
his
companion
said
the
fan

grimm
spelled
it
out
the
while
his
listless
eyes
roved
aimlessly
over
the
throng

man
grimm
wondered
dot

d
that
was

q
a
j
e
grimm
was
puzzled
a
little
now
but
there
was
not
a
wrinkle
nor
the
tiniest
indication
of
perplexity
in
his
face
instead
he
began
talking
of
raphael
cherubs
the
remark
being
called
into
life
by
the
high
complexion
of
a
young
man
who
was
passing
miss
thorne
glanced
at
him
once
keenly
her
splendid
eyes
fairly
aglow
and
the
fan
rattled
on
in
the
code
dot
n
e
a
grimm
was
still
spelling
it
out
then
came
a
perfect
jumble
grimm
followed
it
with
difficulty
a
difficulty
utterly
belied
by
the
quizzical
lines
about
his
mouth
as
he
caught
it
it
was
like
this
j
n
s
e
f
v
a
t
f
followed
by
an
arbitrary
signal
which
is
not
in
the
morse
code
grimm
carefully
stored
that
jumble
away
in
some
recess
of
his
brain
along
with
the
unknown
signal
d
f
he
read
and
then
on
to
the
end
b

i

that
was
all
apparently
the
soft
clatter
of
the
fan
against
the
arm
of
the
chair
ran
on
meaninglessly
after
that
may
i
bring
you
an
ice
grimm
asked
at
last
if
you
will
please
responded
the
se√±orita
and
when
you
come
back
i
reward
you
by
presenting
you
to
miss
thorne
you
find
her
charming
and
cadwallader
has
monopolized
her
long
enough
grimm
bowed
and
left
her
he
had
barely
disappeared
when
rankin
lounged
along
in
front
of
miss
thorne
he
glanced
at
her
paused
and
greeted
her
effusively
why
miss
thorne
he
exclaimed
i
delighted
to
see
you
here
i
understood
you
would
not
be
present
and
their
hands
met
in
a
friendly
clasp
as
she
rose
and
moved
away
with
a
nod
of
excuse
to
cadwallader
a
thin
slip
of
paper
thrice
folded
passed
from
rankin
to
her
she
tugged
at
her
glove
and
thrust
the
little
paper
still
folded
inside
the
palm
is
it
yes
or
no
miss
thorne
asked
in
a
low
tone
frankly
i
ca
say
was
the
reply
he
read
the
message
she
explained
hastily
and
now
he
has
gone
to
decipher
it
she
gathered
up
her
trailing
skirts
over
one
arm
and
together
they
glided
away
through
the
crowd
to
the
strains
of
a
strauss
waltz
i
going
to
faint
in
a
moment
she
said
quite
calmly
to
rankin
please
have
me
sent
to
the
ladies
i
understand
he
replied
quietly
iv
the
fleeing
woman
grimm
went
straight
to
a
quiet
nook
of
the
and
there
after
a
moment
campbell
joined
him
the
bland
benevolence
of
the
chief
face
was
disturbed
by
the
slightest
questioning
uplift
of
his
brows
as
he
dropped
into
a
seat
opposite
grimm
and
lighted
a
cigar
grimm
raised
his
hand
and
a
servant
who
stood
near
approached
them
an
ice
here
grimm
directed
tersely
the
servant
bowed
and
disappeared
and
grimm
hastily
scribbled
something
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
his
chief
there
is
a
reading
in
the
morse
code
of
a
message
that
seems
to
be
unintelligible
grimm
explained
i
have
reason
to
believe
it
is
in
the
continental
code
you
know
the
continental
i
do
campbell
read
this
man
fed
qaje
neaf
and
then
came
the
unknown
that
he
explained
is
y
in
the
continental
code
it
went
on
bfing
when
g
the
chief
read
it
off
glibly
stout
man
red
face
near
conservatory
door
bring
over
when
g
goes
very
well
commented
grimm
ambiguously
with
no
word
of
explanation
he
rose
and
went
out
pausing
at
the
door
to
take
the
ice
which
the
servant
was
bringing
in
the
seat
where
he
had
left
se√±orita
rodriguez
was
vacant
so
was
the
chair
where
miss
thorne
had
been
he
glanced
about
inquiringly
and
a
servant
who
stood
stolidly
near
the
conservatory
door
approached
him
pardon
sir
but
the
lady
who
was
sitting
here
and
he
indicated
the
chair
where
miss
thorne
had
been
sitting
fainted
while
dancing
and
the
lady
who
was
with
you
went
along
when
she
was
removed
to
the
sir
grimm
teeth
closed
with
a
little
snap
did
you
happen
to
notice
any
time
this
evening
a
stout
gentleman
with
red
face
near
the
conservatory
door
he
asked
the
servant
pondered
a
moment
then
shook
his
head
no
sir
thank
you
grimm
was
just
turning
away
when
there
came
the
sharp
vibrant
of
a
revolver
somewhere
off
to
his
left
the
president
that
was
his
first
thought
one
glance
across
the
room
to
where
the
chief
executive
stood
in
conversation
with
two
other
gentlemen
reassured
him
the
choleric
blue
eyes
of
the
president
had
opened
a
little
at
the
sound
then
he
calmly
resumed
the
conversation
grimm
impulsively
started
toward
the
little
group
but
already
a
cordon
was
being
drawn
there
a
cordon
of
men
unobstrusively
forcing
their
way
through
the
crowd
there
was
johnson
and
hastings
and
blair
and
half
a
dozen
others
the
room
had
been
struck
dumb
the
dancers
stopped
with
tense
inquiring
looks
and
the
plaintive
whine
of
the
orchestra
far
away
faltered
then
ceased
there
was
one
brief
instant
of
utter
silence
in
which
women
clung
to
the
arms
of
their
escorts
and
the
brilliant
galaxy
of
colors
halted
then
after
a
moment
there
came
clearly
through
the
stillness
the
excited
guttural
command
of
the
german
ambassador
keep
on
blaying
you
tam
fools
keep
on
blaying
the
orchestra
started
again
tremulously
grimm
nodded
a
silent
approval
of
the
ambassador
command
then
turned
away
toward
his
left
in
the
direction
of
the
shot
after
the
first
dismay
there
was
a
general
movement
of
the
crowd
in
that
direction
a
movement
which
was
checked
by
campbell
appearance
upon
a
chair
with
a
smile
on
his
bland
face
no
harm
done
he
called
one
of
the
officers
present
dropped
his
revolver
and
it
was
accidently
discharged
no
harm
done
there
was
a
moment
excited
chatter
breaths
of
relief
the
orchestra
swung
again
into
the
interrupted
rhythm
and
the
dancers
moved
on
grimm
went
straight
to
his
chief
who
had
stepped
down
from
the
chair
two
other
secret
service
men
stood
behind
him
blocking
the
doorway
that
opened
into
a
narrow
hall
this
way
directed
the
chief
tersely
grimm
walked
along
beside
him
they
skirted
the
end
of
the
until
they
came
to
another
door
opening
into
the
hall
chief
campbell
pushed
it
open
and
entered
one
of
his
men
stood
just
inside
what
was
it
gray
asked
the
chief
se√±or
alvarez
of
the
mexican
legation
was
shot
was
the
reply
dead
only
wounded
he
in
that
room
and
he
indicated
a
door
a
little
way
down
the
hall
fairchild
two
servants
and
a
physician
are
with
him
who
shot
him
do
know
we
found
him
lying
in
the
hall
here
still
followed
by
grimm
the
chief
entered
the
room
and
together
they
bent
over
the
wounded
man
the
bullet
had
entered
the
torso
just
below
the
ribs
on
the
left
side
it
a
clean
wound
the
physician
was
explaining
the
bullet
passed
through
there
no
immediate
danger
se√±or
alvarez
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
about
him
in
bewilderment
then
alarm
overspread
his
face
and
he
made
spasmodic
efforts
to
reach
the
inside
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
grimm
obligingly
thrust
his
hand
into
the
pocket
and
drew
out
its
contents
the
while
se√±or
alvarez
struggled
frantically
just
a
moment
grimm
advised
quietly
i
only
going
to
let
you
see
if
it
is
here
is
it
he
held
the
papers
one
by
one
in
front
of
the
wounded
man
and
each
time
a
shake
of
the
head
was
his
answer
at
the
last
se√±or
alvarez
closed
his
eyes
again
what
sort
of
paper
was
it
inquired
grimm
none
of
your
business
came
the
curt
answer
who
shot
you
none
of
your
business
a
man
se√±or
alvarez
was
silent
a
woman
still
silence
with
some
new
idea
grimm
turned
away
suddenly
and
started
out
into
the
hall
he
met
a
at
the
door
coming
in
her
face
was
blanched
and
she
stuttered
through
sheer
excitement
a
lady
sir
a
lady
she
began
babblingly
grimm
calmly
closed
the
door
shutting
in
the
wounded
man
chief
campbell
and
the
others
then
he
caught
the
maid
sharply
by
the
arm
and
shook
some
coherence
into
her
disordered
brain
a
lady
she
ran
away
sir
the
girl
went
on
in
blank
surprise
what
lady
demanded
grimm
coldly
where
did
she
run
from
why
did
she
run
the
maid
stared
at
him
with
mouth
agape
begin
at
the
beginning
i
was
in
that
room
farther
down
the
hall
sir
the
maid
explained
the
door
was
open
i
heard
the
shot
and
it
frightened
me
so
i
know
i
was
afraid
to
look
out
right
away
sir
then
an
instant
later
a
lady
come
running
along
the
hall
sir
that
way
and
she
indicated
the
rear
of
the
house
then
i
came
to
the
door
and
looked
out
to
see
who
it
was
and
what
was
the
matter
sir
i
was
standing
there
when
a
man
a
man
came
along
after
the
lady
and
banged
the
door
in
my
face
sir
the
door
had
a
spring
lock
and
i
was
so
so
frightened
and
excited
i
could
open
it
right
away
sir
and
and
when
i
did
i
came
here
to
see
what
was
the
matter
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
stopped
that
all
demanded
grimm
yes
sir
except
except
the
lady
had
a
pistol
in
her
hand
sir
grimm
regarded
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
who
was
the
lady
he
asked
at
last
i
forget
her
name
sir
she
was
the
lady
who
who
fainted
in
the
sir
just
a
few
minutes
ago
whatever
emotion
may
have
been
aroused
within
grimm
it
certainly
found
no
expression
in
his
face
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
quite
calm
miss
thorne
perhaps
yes
sir
that
the
name
miss
thorne
i
was
in
the
when
she
was
brought
in
sir
and
i
remember
some
one
called
her
name
grimm
took
the
girl
still
with
excitement
and
led
her
along
the
hall
to
where
gray
stood
take
this
girl
in
charge
gray
he
directed
lock
her
up
if
necessary
do
permit
her
to
say
one
word
to
anybody
you
understand
except
the
chief
grimm
left
them
there
he
passed
along
the
hall
glancing
in
each
room
as
he
went
until
he
came
to
a
short
flight
of
stairs
leading
toward
the
kitchen
he
went
on
down
silently
the
lights
were
burning
but
the
place
was
still
deserted
all
the
servants
who
belonged
there
were
evidently
for
the
moment
transferred
to
other
posts
he
passed
on
through
the
kitchen
and
out
the
back
door
into
the
street
a
little
distance
away
leaning
against
a
a
man
was
standing
he
might
have
been
waiting
for
a
car
grimm
approached
him
beg
pardon
he
said
did
you
see
a
woman
come
out
of
the
back
door
there
yes
just
a
moment
or
so
ago
replied
the
stranger
she
got
into
an
automobile
at
the
corner
i
imagine
this
is
hers
and
he
extended
a
handkerchief
a
dainty
perfumed
trifle
of
lace
i
picked
it
up
immediately
after
she
passed
grimm
took
the
handkerchief
and
examined
it
under
the
light
for
a
time
he
was
thoughtful
with
lowered
eyes
which
finally
raised
met
those
of
the
stranger
with
a
scrutinizing
stare
why
asked
grimm
slowly
and
distinctly
why
did
you
slam
the
door
in
the
girl
face
why
did
i
what
came
the
answering
question
why
did
you
slam
the
door
in
the
girl
face
grimm
repeated
slowly
the
stranger
stared
in
utter
amazement
an
amazement
so
frank
so
unacted
so
genuine
that
grimm
was
satisfied
did
you
see
a
man
come
out
the
door
grimm
pursued
no
say
young
fellow
i
guess
you
had
a
little
too
much
to
drink
have
you
but
by
that
time
grimm
was
turning
the
corner
v
a
visit
to
the
count
the
bland
serenity
of
campbell
face
was
disturbed
by
thin
spidery
lines
of
perplexity
and
the
guileless
blue
eyes
were
vacant
as
he
stared
at
the
top
of
his
desk
grimm
was
talking
from
the
moment
miss
thorne
turned
the
corner
i
lost
all
trace
of
her
he
said
either
she
had
an
automobile
in
waiting
or
else
she
was
lucky
enough
to
find
one
immediately
she
came
out
she
did
not
return
to
the
embassy
ball
last
night
that
much
is
certain
he
paused
reflectively
she
is
a
guest
of
se√±orita
inez
rodriguez
at
the
venezuelan
legation
he
added
yes
i
know
his
chief
nodded
i
did
attempt
to
see
her
there
last
night
for
two
reasons
grimm
continued
first
she
can
have
no
possible
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
she
is
suspected
unless
perhaps
the
man
who
slammed
the
door
he
paused
anyway
she
will
not
attempt
to
leave
washington
i
am
confident
of
that
again
it
did
seem
wise
to
me
to
employ
the
ordinary
crude
police
methods
in
the
case
that
is
go
to
the
venezuelan
legation
and
kick
up
a
row
for
a
long
time
campbell
was
silent
the
perplexed
lines
still
furrowed
his
benevolent
forehead
the
president
is
very
anxious
that
we
get
to
facts
in
this
reported
latin
alliance
as
soon
as
possible
he
said
at
last
irrelevantly
he
mentioned
the
matter
last
night
and
he
has
been
keeping
in
constant
communication
with
gault
in
lisbon
who
however
has
not
been
able
to
add
materially
to
the
original
despatch
under
all
the
circumstances
do
you
think
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
relieve
you
of
the
investigation
of
this
shooting
affair
so
that
you
can
concentrate
on
this
greater
and
more
important
thing
will
se√±or
alvarez
die
asked
grimm
in
turn
his
condition
is
serious
although
the
wound
is
not
necessarily
fatal
was
the
reply
grimm
arose
stretched
his
long
legs
and
stood
for
a
little
while
gazing
out
the
window
finally
he
turned
to
his
chief
what
do
we
know
here
in
the
bureau
about
miss
thorne
thus
far
the
reports
on
her
are
of
the
usual
perfunctory
nature
campbell
explained
he
drew
a
card
from
a
pigeonhole
of
his
desk
and
glanced
at
it
she
arrived
in
washington
two
weeks
and
two
days
ago
from
new
york
off
the
from
liverpool
she
brought
some
sort
of
an
introduction
to
count
di
rosini
the
italian
ambassador
and
he
obtained
for
her
a
special
invitation
to
the
state
ball
which
was
held
that
night
until
four
days
ago
she
was
a
guest
at
the
italian
embassy
but
now
as
you
know
is
a
guest
at
the
venezuelan
legation
since
her
arrival
here
she
has
been
prominently
pushed
forward
into
society
she
has
gone
everywhere
and
been
received
everywhere
in
the
diplomatic
set
we
have
no
knowledge
of
her
beyond
this
there
was
a
question
in
grimm
listless
eyes
as
they
met
those
of
his
chief
the
same
line
of
thought
was
running
in
both
their
minds
born
perhaps
of
the
association
of
ideas
italy
as
one
of
three
great
nations
known
to
be
in
the
latin
compact
prince
benedetto
of
italy
the
secret
envoy
of
three
countries
the
sudden
appearance
of
miss
thorne
at
the
italian
embassy
and
in
the
mind
of
the
younger
man
there
was
more
than
this
a
definite
knowledge
of
a
message
cunningly
transmitted
to
rankin
of
the
german
embassy
by
miss
thorne
there
in
the
can
you
imagine
he
asked
slowly
can
you
imagine
a
person
who
would
be
of
more
value
to
the
latin
governments
in
washington
right
at
this
stage
of
the
negotiations
than
a
brilliant
woman
agent
i
most
certainly
can
not
was
the
chief
unhesitating
response
in
that
case
i
think
it
would
be
wise
to
transfer
the
investigation
of
the
shooting
affair
to
another
man
said
grimm
emphatically
reverting
to
his
chief
question
i
think
on
the
contrary
we
should
find
out
more
about
miss
thorne
precisely
campbell
agreed
ask
all
the
great
capitals
about
her
madrid
paris
and
rome
particularly
then
perhaps
london
and
berlin
and
st
petersburg
campbell
thoughtfully
scribbled
the
names
of
the
cities
on
a
slip
of
paper
do
you
intend
to
arrest
miss
thorne
for
the
shooting
he
queried
i
do
know
replied
grimm
frankly
i
do
know
he
repeated
musingly
if
i
arrest
her
immediately
i
may
cut
off
a
clue
which
will
lead
to
the
other
affair
i
do
know
he
concluded
use
your
own
judgment
and
bear
in
mind
that
a
man
slammed
the
door
in
the
maid
face
i
shall
not
forget
him
grimm
answered
now
i
going
over
to
talk
to
count
di
rosini
for
a
while
the
young
man
went
out
thoughtfully
tugging
at
his
gloves
the
italian
ambassador
received
him
with
an
inquiring
uplift
of
his
dark
brows
i
came
to
make
some
inquiries
in
regard
to
miss
thorne
miss
isabel
thorne
grimm
informed
him
frankly
the
count
was
surprised
but
it
did
appear
in
his
face
as
i
understand
it
the
young
man
pursued
you
are
sponsor
for
her
in
washington
the
count
evasively
diplomatic
born
and
bred
in
a
school
of
caution
considered
the
question
from
every
standpoint
it
may
be
that
i
am
so
regarded
he
admitted
at
last
may
i
inquire
if
the
sponsorship
is
official
personal
social
or
all
three
grimm
continued
there
was
silence
for
a
long
time
i
do
see
the
trend
of
your
questioning
said
the
ambassador
finally
miss
thorne
is
worthy
of
my
protection
in
every
way
let
suppose
a
case
suggested
grimm
blandly
suppose
miss
thorne
had
had
let
us
say
shot
a
man
and
he
was
about
to
die
would
you
feel
justified
in
withdrawing
that
that
protection
as
you
call
it
such
a
thing
is
preposterous
exclaimed
the
ambassador
the
utter
absurdity
of
such
a
charge
would
impel
me
to
offer
her
every
assistance
grimm
nodded
and
if
it
were
proved
to
your
satisfaction
that
she
shoot
him
he
went
on
evenly
the
count
lips
were
drawn
together
in
a
straight
line
whom
may
i
ask
he
inquired
frigidly
are
we
supposing
that
miss
thorne
shot
no
one
particularly
grimm
assured
him
easily
just
suppose
that
she
shot
anybody
me
say
or
se√±or
alvarez
i
ca
answer
a
question
so
ridiculous
as
that
and
suppose
we
go
a
little
further
grimm
insisted
pleasantly
and
assume
that
you
she
shot
some
one
say
se√±or
alvarez
and
you
protect
her
from
the
consequences
you
i
decline
to
suppose
anything
so
utterly
absurd
was
the
rejoinder
grimm
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
idly
twisting
a
seal
ring
on
his
little
finger
the
searching
eyes
of
the
ambassador
found
his
face
blankly
inscrutable
diplomatic
representatives
in
washington
have
certain
obligations
to
this
government
the
young
man
reminded
him
we
that
is
the
government
of
the
united
states
undertake
to
guarantee
the
personal
safety
of
every
accredited
representative
in
return
for
that
protection
we
must
insist
upon
the
name
and
identity
of
a
dangerous
person
who
may
be
known
to
any
foreign
representative
understand
please
i
not
asserting
that
miss
thorne
is
a
dangerous
person
you
are
sponsor
for
her
here
is
she
in
every
way
worthy
of
your
protection
yes
said
the
ambassador
flatly
i
can
take
it
then
that
the
introduction
she
brought
to
you
is
from
a
person
whose
position
is
high
enough
to
insure
miss
thorne
position
that
is
correct
very
well
and
grimm
went
away
vi
revelations
some
vague
indefinable
shadow
darkened
miss
thorne
clear
eyes
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
glow
of
radiant
health
in
her
cheeks
as
she
stepped
from
an
automobile
in
front
of
the
venezuelan
legation
and
ran
lightly
up
the
steps
a
liveried
servant
opened
the
door
a
gentleman
is
waiting
for
you
madam
he
announced
his
card
is
here
on
the
i
was
expecting
him
she
interrupted
which
room
please
the
blue
room
madam
miss
thorne
passed
along
the
hallway
which
led
to
a
suite
of
small
opening
on
a
garden
in
the
rear
pushed
aside
the
porti√®res
and
entered
i
sorry
i
kept
you
she
began
and
then
in
a
tone
of
surprise
i
beg
your
pardon
a
gentleman
rose
and
bowed
gravely
i
am
grimm
of
the
secret
service
he
informed
her
with
frank
courtesy
i
am
afraid
you
were
expecting
some
one
else
i
handed
my
card
to
the
footman
for
an
instant
the
eyes
opened
wide
in
astonishment
and
then
some
quick
subtle
change
swept
over
miss
thorne
face
she
smiled
graciously
and
motioned
him
to
a
seat
this
is
quite
a
different
meeting
from
the
one
se√±orita
rodriguez
had
planned
is
it
she
asked
there
was
a
taunting
curve
on
her
scarlet
lips
the
shadow
passed
from
her
eyes
her
slim
white
hands
lay
idle
in
her
lap
grimm
regarded
her
reflectively
there
was
a
determination
of
steel
back
of
this
charming
exterior
there
was
an
indomitable
will
a
keen
brain
and
all
of
a
woman
intuition
to
reckon
with
she
was
silent
with
a
questioning
upward
slant
of
her
arched
brows
i
am
not
mistaken
in
assuming
that
you
are
a
secret
agent
of
the
italian
government
am
i
he
queried
finally
no
she
responded
readily
in
that
event
i
may
speak
with
perfect
frankness
he
went
on
it
would
be
as
useless
as
it
would
be
absurd
to
approach
the
matter
in
any
other
manner
it
was
a
question
miss
thorne
was
still
smiling
but
again
the
vague
indefinable
shadow
momentarily
lifted
darkened
her
eyes
you
may
be
frank
of
course
she
said
pleasantly
please
go
on
se√±or
alvarez
was
shot
at
the
german
embassy
ball
last
night
grimm
told
her
miss
thorne
nodded
as
if
in
wonder
did
you
or
did
you
not
shoot
him
it
was
quite
casual
she
received
the
question
without
change
of
countenance
but
involuntarily
she
caught
her
breath
it
might
have
been
a
sigh
of
relief
why
do
you
come
to
me
with
such
a
query
she
asked
in
turn
i
beg
your
pardon
interposed
grimm
steadily
did
you
or
did
you
not
shoot
him
no
of
course
i
did
shoot
him
was
the
reply
if
there
was
any
emotion
in
the
tone
it
was
merely
impatience
why
do
you
come
to
me
she
repeated
why
do
i
come
to
you
grimm
echoed
the
question
while
his
listless
eyes
rested
on
her
face
i
will
be
absolutely
frank
as
i
feel
sure
you
would
be
under
the
same
circumstances
he
paused
a
moment
she
nodded
well
immediately
after
the
shooting
you
ran
along
the
hallway
with
a
revolver
in
your
hand
you
ran
down
the
steps
into
the
kitchen
and
out
through
the
back
door
where
you
entered
an
automobile
that
is
not
conjecture
it
is
susceptible
of
proof
by
eye
witnesses
miss
thorne
rose
suddenly
with
a
queer
helpless
little
gesture
of
her
arms
and
walked
to
the
window
she
stood
there
for
a
long
time
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
back
that
brings
us
to
another
question
grimm
continued
mercilessly
if
you
did
not
shoot
se√±or
alvarez
do
you
know
who
did
there
was
another
long
pause
i
want
to
believe
you
miss
thorne
he
supplemented
she
turned
quickly
with
something
of
defiance
in
her
attitude
yes
i
know
she
said
slowly
it
were
useless
to
deny
it
who
was
it
i
wo
tell
you
grimm
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
spoke
earnestly
understand
please
that
by
that
answer
you
assume
equal
guilt
with
the
person
who
actually
did
the
shooting
he
explained
if
you
adhere
to
it
you
compel
me
to
regard
you
as
an
accomplice
his
questioning
took
a
different
line
will
you
explain
how
the
revolver
came
into
your
possession
oh
i
i
picked
it
up
in
the
hallway
there
she
replied
vaguely
i
want
to
believe
you
miss
thorne
grimm
said
again
you
may
i
picked
it
up
in
the
hallway
she
repeated
i
saw
it
lying
there
and
picked
it
up
why
that
instead
of
giving
an
alarm
no
alarm
was
necessary
the
shot
itself
was
an
alarm
then
why
grimm
persisted
coldly
did
you
run
along
the
hallway
and
escape
by
way
of
the
kitchen
if
you
did
not
do
the
shooting
why
the
necessity
of
escape
carrying
the
revolver
there
was
that
in
the
eyes
which
brought
grimm
to
his
feet
his
hands
gripped
each
other
cruelly
his
tone
was
calm
as
always
why
did
you
take
the
revolver
he
asked
miss
thorne
head
drooped
forward
a
little
and
she
was
silent
there
are
only
two
possibilities
of
course
he
went
on
first
that
you
in
spite
of
your
denial
did
the
shooting
i
did
not
the
words
fairly
burst
from
her
tightly
closed
lips
or
that
you
knew
the
revolver
and
took
it
to
save
the
person
man
or
woman
who
fired
the
shot
i
will
assume
for
the
moment
that
this
is
correct
where
is
the
revolver
from
the
adjoining
room
there
came
a
slight
noise
a
faint
breath
of
sound
or
it
might
have
been
only
an
echo
of
silence
their
eyes
were
fixed
each
upon
the
others
unwaveringly
with
not
a
flicker
to
indicate
that
either
had
heard
after
a
moment
miss
thorne
returned
to
her
chair
and
sat
down
it
rather
a
singular
situation
is
it
mr
grimm
she
inquired
irrelevantly
you
grimm
of
the
secret
service
of
the
united
states
i
isabel
thorne
a
secret
agent
of
italy
together
here
one
accusing
the
other
of
a
crime
and
perhaps
with
good
reason
where
is
the
revolver
grimm
insisted
if
you
were
any
one
else
you
i
could
not
afford
to
be
frank
with
you
and
if
you
had
been
any
one
else
but
i
should
have
placed
you
under
arrest
when
i
entered
the
room
she
smiled
and
inclined
her
head
i
understand
she
said
pleasantly
for
the
reason
that
you
are
grimm
of
the
secret
service
i
shall
tell
you
the
truth
i
take
the
revolver
because
i
knew
who
had
fired
the
shot
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
that
person
did
not
act
with
my
knowledge
or
consent
you
do
believe
that
you
do
she
was
pleading
eager
to
convince
him
after
a
while
grimm
nodded
the
revolver
is
beyond
your
reach
and
shall
remain
so
she
resumed
according
to
your
laws
i
suppose
i
am
an
accomplice
that
is
my
misfortune
it
will
in
no
way
alter
my
determination
to
keep
silent
if
i
am
arrested
i
ca
help
it
she
studied
his
face
with
hopeful
eyes
am
i
to
be
arrested
where
is
the
paper
that
was
taken
from
se√±or
alvarez
immediately
after
he
was
shot
grimm
queried
i
do
know
she
replied
frankly
as
i
understand
it
then
the
motive
for
the
shooting
was
to
obtain
possession
of
that
paper
for
your
government
the
individual
who
shot
se√±or
alvarez
obtain
the
paper
yes
and
now
please
am
i
to
be
arrested
and
just
what
was
the
purpose
may
i
inquire
of
the
message
you
telegraphed
with
your
fan
in
the
you
read
that
exclaimed
miss
thorne
in
mock
astonishment
you
read
that
and
the
man
who
read
that
message
perhaps
he
shot
the
se√±or
perhaps
she
taunted
for
a
long
time
grimm
stood
staring
at
her
staring
staring
she
too
rose
and
faced
him
quietly
am
i
to
be
arrested
she
asked
again
why
do
you
make
me
do
it
he
demanded
that
is
my
affair
grimm
laid
a
hand
upon
her
arm
a
hand
that
had
never
known
nervousness
a
moment
longer
he
stared
and
then
madam
you
are
my
prisoner
for
the
attempted
murder
of
se√±or
alvarez
the
rings
on
the
porti√®res
behind
him
clicked
sharply
and
the
draperies
parted
grimm
stood
motionless
with
his
hand
on
miss
thorne
arm
you
were
inquiring
a
moment
ago
for
a
revolver
came
in
a
man
voice
here
it
is
grimm
found
himself
inspecting
the
weapon
from
the
barrel
end
after
a
moment
his
glance
shifted
to
the
blazing
eyes
of
the
man
who
held
it
a
young
man
rather
slight
with
aristocratic
features
and
of
the
pronounced
italian
type
illustration
he
found
himself
inspecting
the
weapon
from
the
barrel
end
my
god
the
words
came
from
miss
thorne
lips
almost
in
a
scream
do
i
did
make
some
inquiries
about
a
revolver
yes
grimm
interrupted
quietly
is
this
the
one
he
raised
his
hand
quite
casually
and
his
fingers
closed
like
steel
around
the
weapon
behind
his
back
miss
thorne
made
some
quick
emphatic
gesture
and
the
released
the
revolver
i
shall
ask
you
please
to
free
miss
thorne
he
requested
courteously
i
shot
se√±or
alvarez
i
too
am
a
secret
agent
of
the
italian
government
willing
and
able
to
defend
myself
miss
thorne
has
told
you
the
truth
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
she
took
the
weapon
and
escaped
because
it
was
mine
here
is
the
paper
that
was
taken
from
se√±or
alvarez
and
he
offered
a
sealed
envelope
i
have
read
it
it
is
not
what
i
expected
you
may
return
it
to
se√±or
alvarez
with
my
compliments
after
a
moment
grimm
hand
fell
away
from
miss
thorne
arm
and
he
regarded
the
with
an
interest
in
which
admiration
even
played
a
part
your
name
he
asked
finally
pietro
petrozinni
was
the
ready
reply
as
i
say
i
accept
all
responsibility
a
few
minutes
later
grimm
and
his
prisoner
passed
out
of
the
legation
side
by
side
and
strolled
down
the
street
together
in
amicable
conversation
half
an
hour
later
se√±or
alvarez
identified
pietro
petrozinni
as
the
man
who
shot
him
and
the
maid
servant
expressed
a
belief
that
he
was
the
man
who
slammed
the
door
in
her
face
vii
the
signal
and
the
original
question
remains
unanswered
remarked
campbell
the
original
question
repeated
grimm
is
prince
benedetto
the
secret
envoy
his
chief
reminded
him
i
wonder
mused
the
young
man
if
the
latin
compact
is
signed
in
the
united
states
the
latin
compact
will
be
signed
in
the
united
states
grimm
interrupted
and
then
after
a
moment
have
we
received
any
further
reports
on
miss
thorne
i
mean
reports
from
our
foreign
agents
the
chief
shook
his
head
inevitably
by
some
act
or
word
she
will
lead
us
to
the
prince
declared
grimm
and
the
moment
he
is
known
to
us
everything
becomes
plain
sailing
we
know
she
a
secret
agent
i
expected
a
denial
but
she
was
quite
frank
about
it
and
i
had
no
intention
whatever
of
placing
her
under
arrest
i
knew
some
one
was
in
the
adjoining
room
because
of
a
slight
noise
in
there
and
i
knew
she
knew
it
she
raised
her
voice
a
little
obviously
for
the
benefit
of
whoever
was
there
from
that
point
everything
i
said
and
did
was
to
compel
that
person
whoever
it
was
to
show
himself
his
chief
nodded
understandingly
grimm
was
silent
for
a
little
then
went
on
the
last
possibility
in
my
mind
at
that
moment
he
confessed
was
that
the
person
in
there
was
the
man
who
shot
se√±or
alvarez
frankly
i
had
half
an
idea
that
that
it
might
be
the
prince
in
person
suddenly
his
mood
changed
and
now
our
lady
of
mystery
may
come
and
go
as
she
likes
because
i
know
even
if
a
dozen
of
our
men
have
ransacked
washington
in
vain
for
the
prince
she
will
inevitably
lead
us
to
him
and
that
reminds
me
i
should
like
to
borrow
blair
and
hastings
and
johnson
please
plant
them
so
they
may
keep
constant
watch
on
miss
thorne
let
them
report
to
you
and
wherever
i
am
i
will
reach
you
over
the
by
the
way
what
was
in
that
sealed
packet
that
was
taken
from
se√±or
alvarez
campbell
inquired
curiously
it
had
something
to
do
with
some
railroad
franchises
responded
grimm
as
he
rose
i
sealed
it
again
and
returned
it
to
the
se√±or
evidently
it
was
not
what
signor
petrozinni
expected
to
find
in
fact
he
admitted
it
was
what
he
was
looking
for
for
a
little
while
the
two
men
gazed
thoughtfully
each
into
the
eyes
of
the
other
then
grimm
entered
his
private
office
where
he
sat
for
an
hour
with
his
immaculate
boots
on
his
desk
thinking
a
he
had
been
thrust
forward
by
his
government
to
prevent
it
subtle
eyes
his
highness
prince
benedetto
a
haunting
smile
and
scarlet
lips
at
about
the
moment
he
rose
to
go
out
miss
thorne
closely
veiled
left
the
venezuelan
legation
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
street
to
a
corner
where
without
a
word
she
entered
a
waiting
automobile
the
wheels
spun
and
the
car
leaped
forward
for
a
mile
or
more
it
wound
aimlessly
in
and
out
occasionally
bisecting
its
own
path
finally
miss
thorne
leaned
forward
and
touched
the
chauffeur
on
the
arm
now
she
said
the
car
straightened
out
into
a
street
of
stately
residences
and
scuttled
along
until
the
placid
bosom
of
the
potomac
came
into
view
beside
that
for
a
few
minutes
then
over
the
bridge
to
the
virginia
side
in
the
dilapidated
little
city
of
alexandria
the
car
did
not
slacken
its
speed
but
wound
in
and
out
through
dingy
streets
past
negro
huts
for
half
an
hour
before
it
came
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
an
old
brick
mansion
this
is
number
the
chauffeur
announced
miss
thorne
entered
the
house
with
a
key
and
was
gone
for
ten
minutes
perhaps
she
was
readjusting
her
veil
when
she
came
out
and
stepped
into
the
car
silently
again
it
moved
forward
on
to
the
end
of
the
dingy
street
and
finally
into
the
open
country
three
four
five
miles
perhaps
out
the
old
baltimore
road
and
again
the
car
stopped
this
time
in
front
of
an
ancient
colonial
outwardly
the
place
seemed
to
be
deserted
the
blinds
battered
and
stripped
of
paint
by
wind
and
rain
were
all
closed
and
one
corner
of
the
small
veranda
had
crumbled
away
from
age
and
neglect
a
narrow
path
strewn
with
pine
needles
led
tortuously
up
to
the
door
in
the
rear
of
the
house
rising
from
an
old
barn
a
thin
pole
with
a
attachment
at
the
apex
thrust
its
point
into
the
open
above
the
dense
odorous
pines
it
appeared
to
be
a
wireless
mast
miss
thorne
passed
around
the
house
and
entered
the
barn
a
man
came
forward
and
kissed
her
a
thin
little
man
of
indeterminate
age
drying
his
hands
on
a
piece
of
cotton
waste
his
face
was
pale
with
the
pallor
of
one
who
knows
little
outdoor
life
his
eyes
and
with
some
feverish
inward
fire
and
the
thin
lips
were
pressed
together
in
a
sharp
line
behind
him
was
a
long
bench
on
which
were
scattered
tools
of
various
sorts
fantastically
shaped
chemical
apparatus
two
or
three
electric
batteries
of
odd
sizes
and
ranged
along
one
end
of
it
in
a
row
were
a
score
or
more
metal
spheroids
a
shade
larger
than
a
shell
from
somewhere
in
the
rear
came
the
clatter
of
a
small
gasoline
engine
and
still
farther
away
was
an
electric
dynamo
is
the
test
arranged
rosa
the
little
man
queried
eagerly
in
italian
the
date
is
not
fixed
yet
she
replied
in
the
same
language
it
will
be
i
hope
within
the
next
two
weeks
and
then
fame
and
fortune
for
both
of
us
he
interrupted
with
quick
enthusiasm
ah
rosa
i
have
worked
and
waited
so
long
for
this
and
now
it
will
come
and
with
it
the
dominion
of
the
world
again
by
our
country
how
will
i
know
when
the
date
is
fixed
it
would
not
be
well
to
write
me
here
my
lady
of
mystery
stroked
the
slender
nervous
hand
caressingly
and
a
great
affection
shone
in
the
eyes
at
eight
on
the
night
of
the
test
she
explained
still
speaking
italian
a
single
light
will
appear
at
the
apex
of
the
capitol
dome
in
washington
that
is
the
signal
agreed
upon
it
can
be
seen
by
all
in
the
city
and
is
visible
here
from
the
window
of
your
bedroom
yes
yes
he
exclaimed
the
feverish
glitter
in
his
eyes
deepened
if
there
is
a
fog
of
course
you
will
not
attempt
the
test
she
went
on
no
not
in
a
fog
he
put
in
quickly
it
must
be
clear
and
if
it
is
clear
you
can
see
the
light
in
the
dome
without
difficulty
and
all
your
plans
are
working
out
well
yes
and
yours
i
do
think
there
is
any
question
but
that
both
england
and
the
united
states
will
buy
do
you
know
what
it
means
do
you
know
what
it
means
he
was
silent
a
moment
his
hands
working
nervously
then
with
an
effort
and
his
highness
his
highness
is
safe
the
subtle
eyes
grew
misty
thoughtful
for
a
moment
then
cleared
again
he
is
safe
she
repeated
mexico
and
venezuela
were
he
began
we
do
know
yet
what
they
will
do
the
venezuelan
answer
is
locked
in
the
safe
at
the
legation
i
will
know
what
it
is
within
hours
she
was
silent
a
little
our
difficulty
now
our
greatest
difficulty
is
the
hostility
of
the
french
ambassador
to
the
compact
his
government
has
not
yet
notified
him
of
the
presence
of
prince
he
does
not
believe
in
the
feasibility
of
the
plan
and
we
have
to
to
proceed
to
extremes
to
prevent
him
working
against
us
but
they
see
the
incalculable
advantages
to
follow
upon
such
a
compact
with
the
vast
power
that
will
be
given
to
them
over
the
whole
earth
by
this
he
indicated
the
long
littered
they
see
it
they
will
see
it
luigi
said
miss
thorne
gently
and
now
how
are
you
are
you
well
are
you
comfortable
it
such
a
dreary
old
place
here
i
suppose
so
he
replied
and
he
met
the
solicitous
eyes
for
an
instant
yes
i
am
quite
comfortable
he
added
i
have
no
time
to
be
otherwise
with
all
the
work
i
must
do
it
will
mean
so
much
they
were
both
silent
for
a
time
finally
miss
thorne
walked
over
to
the
long
table
and
curiously
lifted
one
of
the
spheroids
it
was
a
sinister
looking
thing
nickeled
glittering
at
one
end
of
it
was
a
delicate
vibratory
apparatus
not
unlike
the
transmitter
of
a
telephone
and
the
other
end
was
threaded
as
if
the
spheroid
was
made
as
an
attachment
to
some
other
device
with
that
we
control
the
world
exclaimed
the
man
triumphantly
and
it
mine
rosa
mine
it
wonderful
she
mused
softly
wonderful
and
now
i
must
go
i
may
not
see
you
again
until
after
the
test
because
i
shall
be
watched
and
followed
wherever
i
go
if
i
get
an
opportunity
i
shall
reach
you
by
telephone
but
not
even
that
unless
it
is
necessary
there
is
always
danger
always
danger
she
repeated
thoughtfully
she
was
thinking
of
grimm
i
understand
said
the
man
simply
and
look
out
for
the
signal
the
light
in
the
apex
of
the
capitol
dome
she
went
on
i
understand
the
night
must
be
perfectly
clear
and
understand
that
the
test
is
to
be
made
promptly
at
three
by
your
chronometer
at
three
he
repeated
for
a
moment
they
stood
with
their
arms
around
each
other
then
tenderly
his
visitor
kissed
him
and
went
out
he
remained
looking
after
her
vacantly
until
the
of
her
automobile
as
it
moved
off
down
the
road
was
lost
in
the
distance
then
turned
again
to
the
long
viii
miss
thorne
and
not
miss
thorne
from
a
pleasant
of
her
apartments
on
the
second
floor
miss
thorne
looked
out
upon
the
avenue
with
inscrutable
eyes
behind
the
closely
drawn
shutters
of
another
farther
down
the
avenue
on
the
corner
she
knew
a
man
named
hastings
was
hiding
she
knew
that
for
an
hour
or
more
he
had
been
watching
her
as
she
wrote
in
the
other
direction
in
a
house
near
the
corner
another
man
named
blair
was
similarly
ensconced
and
he
too
had
been
watching
as
she
wrote
there
should
be
a
third
man
johnson
miss
thorne
curiously
studied
the
face
of
each
seeking
therein
something
to
remember
she
sat
at
the
little
mahogany
desk
and
a
note
with
the
ink
yet
wet
upon
it
lay
face
up
before
her
it
was
addressed
to
signor
pietro
petrozinni
in
the
district
prison
and
read
my
dear
friend
i
have
been
waiting
to
write
you
with
the
hope
that
i
could
report
se√±or
alvarez
out
of
danger
but
his
condition
i
regret
to
say
remains
unchanged
shall
i
send
an
attorney
to
you
would
you
like
a
book
of
any
kind
or
some
delicacy
sent
in
from
a
restaurant
can
i
be
of
any
service
to
you
in
any
way
if
i
can
please
drop
me
a
line
sincerely
isabel
thorne
at
last
she
rose
and
standing
in
the
window
read
the
note
over
folded
it
placed
it
in
an
envelope
and
sealed
it
a
maid
came
in
answer
to
her
ring
and
there
at
the
window
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
blair
and
hastings
and
perhaps
johnson
she
handed
the
note
to
the
maid
with
instructions
to
mail
it
immediately
two
minutes
later
she
saw
the
maid
go
out
along
the
avenue
to
a
on
the
corner
then
she
drew
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
room
slipped
on
a
wrap
and
standing
away
from
the
window
safe
beyond
the
reach
of
prying
eyes
waited
patiently
for
the
postman
he
appeared
about
five
and
simultaneously
another
man
turned
the
corner
near
the
and
spoke
to
him
then
together
they
disappeared
from
view
around
the
corner
so
that
johnson
is
it
mused
miss
thorne
and
she
smiled
a
little
grimm
certainly
pays
me
the
compliment
of
having
me
carefully
watched
a
few
minutes
later
she
dropped
into
the
seat
at
the
desk
again
the
dark
wrap
had
been
thrown
aside
and
hastings
and
blair
from
their
could
see
her
distinctly
after
a
while
they
saw
her
rise
quickly
as
an
automobile
turned
into
the
avenue
and
lean
toward
the
window
eagerly
looking
out
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
the
legation
and
cadwallader
an
of
the
british
embassy
who
was
alone
in
the
car
raised
his
cap
she
nodded
and
smiled
then
disappeared
in
the
shadows
of
the
room
again
cadwallader
went
to
the
door
spoke
to
the
servant
there
then
returned
and
busied
himself
about
the
car
hastings
and
blair
watched
intently
both
the
door
and
the
window
for
a
long
time
finally
a
closely
veiled
and
muffled
figure
appeared
at
the
and
waved
a
gloved
hand
at
cadwallader
who
again
lifted
his
cap
a
minute
later
the
veiled
woman
came
out
of
the
front
door
shook
hands
with
cadwallader
and
got
in
the
car
he
also
climbed
in
and
the
car
moved
slowly
away
simultaneously
the
front
door
of
the
house
on
the
corner
where
hastings
had
been
hiding
and
the
front
door
of
the
house
near
the
corner
where
blair
had
been
hiding
opened
and
two
heads
peered
out
as
the
car
approached
hastings
he
withdrew
into
the
hallway
but
blair
came
out
and
hurried
past
the
legation
in
the
direction
of
the
rapidly
disappearing
motor
hastings
joined
him
they
spoke
together
then
turned
the
corner
it
was
about
ten
that
night
when
hastings
reported
to
campbell
at
his
home
we
followed
the
car
in
a
rented
automobile
from
the
time
it
turned
the
corner
out
through
alexandria
and
along
the
old
baltimore
road
into
the
city
of
baltimore
he
explained
it
was
dark
by
the
time
we
reached
alexandria
but
we
stuck
to
the
car
ahead
running
without
lights
until
we
came
in
sight
of
druid
hill
park
and
then
we
had
to
show
lights
or
be
held
up
we
covered
those
forty
miles
going
in
less
than
two
hours
after
the
car
passed
druid
hill
it
slowed
up
a
little
and
ran
off
the
turnpike
into
north
avenue
then
into
north
charles
street
and
slowly
along
that
as
if
they
were
looking
for
a
number
at
last
it
stopped
and
miss
thorne
got
out
and
entered
a
house
she
was
gone
for
more
than
half
an
hour
leaving
cadwallader
with
the
car
while
she
was
gone
i
made
some
inquiries
and
learned
that
the
house
was
occupied
by
a
thomas
griswold
i
do
know
anything
else
about
him
blair
may
have
learned
something
now
comes
the
curious
part
of
it
and
hastings
looked
a
little
sheepish
when
miss
thorne
came
out
of
the
house
she
was
not
miss
thorne
at
all
was
se√±orita
inez
daughter
of
the
venezuelan
minister
she
wore
the
same
clothing
miss
thorne
had
worn
going
but
her
veil
was
lifted
veiled
and
all
muffled
up
one
would
have
taken
oath
it
was
the
same
woman
she
and
cadwallader
are
back
in
washington
now
or
are
coming
that
all
except
blair
is
still
in
baltimore
awaiting
orders
i
caught
the
train
from
the
charles
street
station
and
came
back
johnson
you
know
yes
i
seen
johnson
interrupted
campbell
are
you
absolutely
positive
that
the
woman
you
saw
get
into
the
automobile
with
cadwallader
was
miss
thorne
absolutely
replied
hastings
without
hesitation
i
saw
her
in
her
own
room
with
her
wraps
on
then
saw
her
come
down
and
get
into
the
car
that
all
said
the
chief
good
night
for
an
hour
or
more
he
sat
in
a
great
comfortable
chair
in
the
of
his
own
home
the
guileless
blue
eyes
vacant
staring
and
spidery
lines
in
the
benevolent
forehead
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
following
se√±or
rodriguez
the
minister
from
venezuela
reported
to
the
secret
service
bureau
the
disappearance
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
from
a
safe
in
his
private
office
at
the
legation
ix
fifty
thousand
dollars
campbell
was
talking
for
several
months
past
he
said
the
international
investment
company
through
its
representative
cressy
has
been
secretly
negotiating
with
se√±or
rodriguez
for
certain
asphalt
properties
in
venezuela
three
days
ago
these
negotiations
were
successfully
concluded
and
yesterday
afternoon
cressy
in
secret
paid
to
se√±or
rodriguez
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
american
gold
the
first
of
four
payments
of
similar
sums
this
gold
was
to
have
been
shipped
to
philadelphia
by
express
to
catch
a
steamer
for
venezuela
grimm
nodded
the
fact
that
this
gold
was
in
se√±or
rodriguez
possession
could
not
have
been
known
to
more
than
half
a
dozen
persons
as
the
negotiations
throughout
have
been
in
strict
secrecy
and
campbell
smiled
benignly
so
much
now
se√±or
rodriguez
has
just
telephoned
asking
that
i
send
a
man
to
the
legation
at
once
the
gold
was
kept
there
over
night
or
perhaps
i
should
say
that
the
se√±or
intended
to
keep
it
there
over
night
campbell
stared
at
grimm
for
a
moment
then
miss
thorne
you
know
is
a
guest
at
the
legation
that
is
why
i
am
referring
the
matter
to
you
i
understand
said
grimm
and
ten
minutes
later
grimm
presented
himself
to
se√±or
rodriguez
the
minister
from
venezuela
bubbling
with
excitement
was
pacing
forth
and
back
across
his
office
ruffling
his
hair
with
nervous
twining
fingers
grimm
sat
down
se√±or
he
inquired
placidly
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
would
weigh
nearly
two
hundred
pounds
would
it
se√±or
rodriguez
stared
at
him
blankly
he
agreed
absently
and
then
in
english
yes
i
should
imagine
so
well
was
all
of
it
stolen
or
only
a
part
of
it
grimm
went
on
the
minister
gazed
into
the
listless
eyes
for
a
time
then
apparently
bewildered
walked
forth
and
back
across
the
room
again
finally
he
sat
down
all
of
it
he
admitted
i
ca
understand
it
no
one
not
a
soul
in
this
house
except
myself
knew
it
was
here
in
addition
to
this
weight
of
say
two
hundred
pounds
fifty
thousand
dollars
would
make
considerable
bulk
mused
grimm
very
well
therefore
it
would
appear
that
the
person
or
persons
who
got
it
must
have
gone
away
from
here
heavily
laden
se√±or
rodriguez
nodded
and
now
se√±or
grimm
continued
if
you
will
kindly
state
the
circumstances
immediately
preceding
and
following
the
theft
a
slight
frown
which
had
been
growing
upon
the
smooth
brow
of
the
diplomatist
was
instantly
dissipated
the
money
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
coin
was
paid
to
me
yesterday
afternoon
about
four
he
began
slowly
in
explanation
by
cressy
of
the
international
investment
company
supplemented
grimm
yes
go
on
the
diplomatist
favored
the
young
man
with
one
sharp
inquiring
glance
and
continued
the
gentleman
who
paid
the
money
remained
here
from
four
until
nine
while
i
personally
counted
it
as
i
counted
it
i
placed
it
in
canvas
bags
and
when
he
had
gone
i
took
these
bags
from
this
room
into
that
he
indicated
a
closed
door
to
his
right
and
personally
stowed
them
away
in
the
safe
i
closed
and
locked
the
door
of
the
safe
myself
i
that
it
locked
and
that
all
except
this
morning
the
money
was
gone
every
dollar
of
it
safe
blown
inquired
grimm
no
se√±or
exclaimed
the
diplomatist
with
sudden
violence
no
the
safe
was
not
blown
it
was
and
exactly
as
i
had
left
it
grimm
was
idly
twisting
the
seal
ring
on
his
little
finger
just
as
i
left
it
se√±or
rodriguez
repeated
excitedly
last
night
after
i
locked
the
safe
door
i
tried
it
to
make
certain
that
it
locked
i
happened
to
notice
then
that
the
pointer
on
the
dial
had
stopped
precisely
at
number
this
morning
when
i
unlocked
the
safe
and
of
course
i
did
know
then
that
the
money
had
been
taken
the
pointer
was
still
at
number
he
paused
with
one
hand
in
the
air
grimm
continued
to
twist
the
seal
ring
it
was
all
like
like
some
trick
on
the
stage
the
minister
went
on
like
the
magician
disappearing
lady
or
or
it
was
as
though
i
had
not
put
the
money
into
the
safe
at
all
did
you
inquired
grimm
amiably
did
i
blazed
se√±or
rodriguez
why
se√±or
i
did
he
concluded
meekly
grimm
believed
him
who
else
knows
the
combination
of
the
safe
he
queried
no
one
se√±or
not
a
living
soul
your
secretary
for
instance
not
even
my
secretary
some
servant
some
member
of
your
family
i
tell
you
se√±or
not
one
person
in
all
the
world
knew
that
combination
except
myself
se√±or
rodriguez
insisted
your
secretary
a
servant
some
member
of
your
family
might
have
seen
you
unlock
the
safe
some
time
and
thus
learned
the
combination
se√±or
rodriguez
did
not
quite
know
whether
to
be
annoyed
at
persistence
or
to
admire
the
tenacity
with
which
he
held
to
this
one
point
you
must
understand
se√±or
grimm
that
many
state
documents
are
kept
in
the
safe
he
said
finally
therefore
it
is
not
advisable
that
any
one
should
know
the
combination
i
have
made
it
an
absolute
rule
as
did
my
predecessors
here
never
to
unlock
the
safe
in
the
presence
of
another
person
state
documents
grimm
lips
silently
repeated
the
words
then
aloud
perhaps
there
a
record
of
the
combination
somewhere
if
you
had
died
suddenly
for
instance
how
would
the
safe
have
been
opened
there
would
have
been
only
one
way
se√±or
blow
it
open
there
is
no
record
well
if
we
accept
all
that
as
true
observed
grimm
musingly
it
would
seem
that
you
either
did
put
the
money
into
the
safe
at
all
or
please
sit
down
there
nothing
personal
in
this
or
else
the
money
was
taken
out
of
the
safe
without
it
being
unlocked
this
last
would
have
been
a
miracle
and
this
is
not
the
day
of
miracles
therefore
grimm
well
modulated
voice
trailed
off
into
silence
se√±or
rodriguez
came
to
his
feet
with
a
blaze
of
anger
in
his
eyes
grimm
was
watching
him
curiously
i
understand
then
se√±or
said
the
minister
deliberately
that
you
believe
that
i
i
believe
that
you
have
told
the
truth
interrupted
grimm
placidly
that
is
the
truth
so
far
as
you
know
it
but
you
have
stated
one
thing
in
error
somebody
besides
yourself
know
the
combination
whether
they
knew
it
or
not
at
this
time
yesterday
i
say
but
somebody
knows
it
now
se√±or
rodriguez
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
the
implied
accusation
had
been
withdrawn
as
pleasantly
and
frankly
as
it
had
been
put
forward
i
ran
across
a
chap
in
new
york
once
for
instance
grimm
took
the
trouble
to
explain
who
could
unlock
any
safe
that
is
any
safe
of
the
kind
used
at
that
time
twelve
or
fourteen
years
ago
so
you
see
i
doubt
if
he
would
be
so
successful
with
the
new
models
with
all
their
improvements
but
then
you
know
he
would
have
made
an
ideal
burglar
that
chap
now
se√±or
who
lives
here
in
the
legation
with
you
my
secretary
se√±or
diaz
my
daughter
inez
and
just
at
the
moment
a
miss
thorne
miss
isabel
thorne
the
se√±or
informed
him
also
four
servants
two
men
and
two
women
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
daughter
and
miss
thorne
grimm
informed
him
now
suppose
we
take
a
look
at
the
safe
certainly
se√±or
rodriguez
started
toward
the
closed
door
just
as
there
came
a
timid
knock
from
the
hall
he
glanced
at
grimm
who
nodded
then
he
called
come
in
the
door
opened
and
miss
thorne
entered
she
was
clad
in
some
filmy
morning
gown
with
her
radiant
hair
caught
up
on
her
white
neck
at
sight
of
grimm
the
eyes
opened
as
if
in
surprise
and
she
paused
irresolutely
i
beg
your
pardon
se√±or
she
said
addressing
the
diplomatist
i
did
not
know
you
were
engaged
and
mr
grimm
she
extended
a
slim
white
hand
and
the
young
man
bowed
low
over
it
we
are
old
friends
she
explained
smilingly
to
the
minister
then
i
think
i
must
have
dropped
my
handkerchief
when
i
was
in
here
yesterday
with
inez
perhaps
you
found
it
replied
se√±or
rodriguez
gallantly
it
is
on
my
desk
in
here
just
a
moment
he
opened
the
door
and
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
grimm
eyes
met
those
of
miss
isabel
thorne
and
there
was
no
listlessness
in
them
now
only
interest
she
smiled
at
him
tauntingly
and
lowered
her
lids
se√±or
rodriguez
appeared
from
the
other
room
with
the
handkerchief
gracias
she
thanked
him
hay
de
que
he
returned
as
he
opened
the
door
for
her
grimm
au
she
dropped
a
little
curtsey
and
still
smiling
went
out
she
is
charming
se√±or
the
diplomatist
assured
him
enthusiastically
albeit
irrelevantly
such
vivacity
such
personality
such
such
she
is
charming
the
safe
please
grimm
reminded
him
x
a
safe
opening
together
they
entered
the
adjoining
room
which
was
small
compared
to
the
one
they
had
just
left
se√±or
rodriguez
used
it
as
a
private
office
his
desk
was
on
their
right
between
two
windows
overlooking
the
same
pleasant
little
garden
which
was
visible
from
the
suite
of
tiny
farther
along
the
safe
a
formidable
looking
receptacle
of
black
enameled
steel
stood
at
their
left
closed
and
locked
the
remaining
wall
space
of
the
room
was
given
over
to
oak
cabinets
evidently
a
storage
place
for
the
less
important
legation
papers
has
any
one
besides
yourself
been
in
this
room
grimm
inquired
not
a
soul
se√±or
was
the
reply
grimm
went
over
and
examined
the
windows
they
were
both
locked
inside
and
there
were
no
marks
of
any
sort
on
the
sills
they
are
just
as
i
left
them
last
night
explained
se√±or
rodriguez
i
have
not
touched
them
and
there
only
one
door
mused
grimm
meaning
that
by
which
they
had
entered
so
it
would
appear
that
whoever
was
here
last
night
entered
through
that
room
very
well
he
walked
around
the
room
once
opening
and
shutting
the
doors
of
the
cabinets
as
he
passed
and
finally
paused
in
front
of
the
safe
a
brief
examination
of
the
nickeled
dial
and
handle
and
of
the
enameled
edges
of
the
heavy
door
satisfied
him
that
no
force
had
been
employed
the
safe
had
merely
been
unlocked
whereupon
he
sat
himself
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
it
what
are
the
first
and
second
figures
of
the
combination
he
asked
then
back
to
ten
grimm
set
the
dial
at
and
then
with
his
ear
pressed
closely
against
the
polished
door
turned
the
dial
slowly
back
se√±or
rodriguez
stood
looking
on
helplessly
but
none
the
less
intently
the
pointer
read
ten
then
nine
eight
seven
five
grimm
gazed
at
it
thoughtfully
after
which
he
did
it
all
over
again
placidly
and
without
haste
now
we
look
inside
please
he
requested
rising
se√±or
rodriguez
unlocked
the
safe
the
while
grimm
respectfully
turned
his
eyes
away
then
pulled
the
door
wide
open
the
books
had
been
piled
one
on
top
of
another
and
thrust
into
various
pigeonholes
at
the
top
grimm
understood
that
this
disorder
was
the
result
of
making
room
at
the
bottom
for
the
bulk
of
gold
and
asked
no
questions
instead
he
sat
down
upon
the
floor
again
the
lock
on
this
private
compartment
at
the
top
is
broken
he
remarked
after
a
moment
the
diplomatist
agreed
evidently
the
robbers
were
not
content
with
only
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
they
imagined
that
something
else
of
value
was
hidden
there
was
there
asked
grimm
naively
he
did
look
around
nothing
of
monetary
value
the
se√±or
explained
there
were
some
important
state
papers
in
there
they
are
there
yet
but
no
money
none
of
the
papers
was
stolen
no
se√±or
there
were
only
nine
packets
they
are
there
yet
contents
all
right
yes
i
personally
looked
them
over
grimm
drew
out
the
packets
of
papers
one
by
one
they
were
all
unsealed
save
the
last
when
he
reached
for
that
se√±or
rodriguez
made
a
quick
involuntary
motion
toward
it
with
his
hand
this
one
sealed
commented
grimm
it
does
happen
that
you
opened
it
and
sealed
it
again
se√±or
rodriguez
stood
staring
at
him
blankly
for
a
moment
then
some
sudden
apprehension
was
aroused
for
a
startled
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
again
he
reached
for
the
packet
he
exclaimed
let
me
see
se√±or
going
to
open
it
asked
grimm
yes
se√±or
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
grimm
rose
and
walked
over
to
the
window
where
the
light
was
better
he
scrutinized
the
sealed
packet
closely
there
were
three
red
splotches
of
wax
upon
it
each
impressed
with
the
legation
seal
the
envelope
was
without
marks
otherwise
he
turned
and
twisted
it
aimlessly
and
peered
curiously
at
the
various
seals
after
which
he
handed
it
to
the
frankly
impatient
diplomatist
se√±or
rodriguez
opened
it
with
nervous
twitching
fingers
grimm
had
turned
toward
the
safe
again
but
he
heard
the
crackle
of
parchment
as
some
document
was
drawn
out
of
the
envelope
and
then
came
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
having
satisfied
his
sudden
fears
for
the
safety
of
the
paper
whatever
it
was
the
se√±or
placed
it
in
another
envelope
and
sealed
it
again
with
elaborate
care
grimm
dropped
into
the
swivel
chair
at
the
desk
se√±or
he
inquired
pleasantly
your
daughter
and
miss
thorne
were
in
this
room
yesterday
afternoon
yes
replied
the
diplomatist
as
if
surprised
at
the
question
what
time
please
about
three
they
were
going
out
driving
why
and
just
where
please
did
you
find
that
handkerchief
continued
grimm
handkerchief
repeated
the
diplomatist
you
mean
miss
handkerchief
he
paused
and
regarded
grimm
keenly
se√±or
what
am
i
to
understand
from
that
question
it
was
plain
enough
replied
grimm
where
did
you
find
that
handkerchief
there
was
silence
for
an
instant
in
this
room
yes
replied
se√±or
rodriguez
at
last
near
the
safe
grimm
persisted
yes
came
the
slow
reply
again
just
here
and
he
indicated
a
spot
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
safe
and
did
you
find
it
yesterday
afternoon
last
night
this
morning
this
morning
and
without
any
apparent
reason
the
diplomatist
face
turned
deathly
white
but
se√±or
se√±or
you
are
mistaken
there
can
be
nothing
a
woman
two
hundred
pounds
of
gold
se√±or
grimm
was
still
pleasant
about
it
his
curiosity
was
absolutely
impersonal
his
eyes
grown
listless
again
were
turned
straight
into
the
other
face
if
that
handkerchief
had
been
there
last
night
se√±or
he
resumed
quietly
would
you
have
noticed
it
when
you
placed
the
gold
in
the
safe
se√±or
rodriguez
stared
at
him
a
long
time
i
do
know
he
said
at
last
he
dropped
back
into
a
chair
with
his
face
in
his
hands
se√±or
he
burst
out
suddenly
impetuously
after
a
moment
if
the
gold
is
not
recovered
i
am
ruined
you
understand
that
better
than
i
can
tell
you
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
could
not
be
explained
to
my
government
he
rose
suddenly
and
faced
the
impassive
young
man
with
merciless
determination
in
his
face
you
must
find
the
gold
se√±or
he
said
no
matter
who
may
be
who
may
suffer
inquired
grimm
find
the
gold
se√±or
very
well
commented
grimm
without
moving
do
me
the
favor
please
to
regain
possession
of
the
handkerchief
you
just
returned
to
miss
thorne
and
to
send
to
me
here
your
secretary
se√±or
diaz
and
your
servants
one
by
one
i
shall
question
them
alone
no
do
be
alarmed
unless
they
know
of
the
robbery
they
shall
get
no
inkling
of
it
from
me
first
be
good
enough
to
replace
the
packet
in
the
safe
and
lock
it
se√±or
rodriguez
replaced
the
packet
without
question
afterward
locking
the
door
then
went
out
a
moment
later
se√±or
diaz
appeared
he
remained
with
grimm
for
just
eight
minutes
se√±or
rodriguez
entered
again
as
his
secretary
passed
on
and
laid
a
lace
handkerchief
on
the
desk
grimm
stared
at
it
curiously
for
a
long
time
it
the
same
handkerchief
there
no
doubt
whatever
about
it
no
se√±or
i
got
it
by
it
of
no
consequence
interrupted
grimm
now
the
servants
please
the
men
first
the
first
of
the
men
servants
was
in
the
room
two
minutes
the
second
the
butler
was
there
five
minutes
one
of
the
women
was
not
questioned
at
all
the
other
remained
ten
minutes
grimm
followed
her
into
the
hall
se√±or
rodriguez
stood
there
helpless
impatient
well
he
demanded
eagerly
i
going
out
a
little
while
replied
grimm
placidly
no
one
has
even
an
intimation
of
the
affair
please
keep
the
matter
absolutely
to
yourself
until
i
return
that
was
all
the
door
opened
and
closed
and
he
was
gone
at
the
end
of
an
hour
he
returned
passed
on
through
to
the
diplomatist
private
office
sat
down
in
front
of
the
locked
safe
again
and
set
the
dial
at
se√±or
rodriguez
looked
on
astonished
as
grimm
pressed
the
soft
rubber
sounder
of
a
stethoscope
against
the
safe
door
and
began
turning
the
dial
back
toward
ten
slowly
slowly
minutes
later
the
lock
clicked
grimm
rose
turned
the
handle
and
pulled
the
safe
door
open
that
how
it
was
done
he
explained
to
the
amazed
diplomatist
and
now
please
have
a
servant
hand
my
card
to
miss
thorne
xi
the
lace
handkerchief
still
wearing
the
graceful
filmy
morning
gown
with
an
added
touch
of
scarlet
in
her
hair
a
single
red
rose
miss
thorne
came
into
the
where
grimm
sat
waiting
there
was
curiosity
in
her
manner
thinly
veiled
but
the
haunting
smile
still
lingered
about
her
lips
grimm
bowed
low
and
placed
a
chair
for
her
after
which
he
stood
for
a
time
staring
down
at
one
slim
white
hand
at
rest
on
the
arm
of
the
seat
at
last
he
too
sat
down
i
believe
he
said
slowly
without
preliminaries
this
is
your
handkerchief
he
offered
the
lacy
trifle
odd
in
design
unique
in
workmanship
obviously
of
foreign
texture
and
she
accepted
it
yes
she
agreed
readily
i
must
have
dropped
it
again
that
is
the
one
handed
to
you
by
se√±or
rodriguez
grimm
told
her
i
think
you
said
you
lost
it
in
his
office
yesterday
afternoon
yes
she
nodded
inquiringly
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
se√±or
rodriguez
butler
positively
identifies
it
as
one
he
restored
to
you
twice
at
dinner
last
evening
between
seven
and
nine
grimm
went
on
dispassionately
indeed
exclaimed
miss
thorne
the
se√±or
identifies
it
as
one
he
found
this
morning
in
his
office
grimm
explained
obligingly
during
the
night
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
were
stolen
from
his
safe
there
was
not
the
slightest
change
of
expression
in
her
face
the
eyes
were
still
inquiring
in
their
gaze
the
white
hands
still
at
rest
the
scarlet
lips
still
curled
slightly
an
echo
of
a
smile
no
force
was
used
in
opening
the
safe
grimm
resumed
it
was
unlocked
it
an
old
model
and
i
have
demonstrated
how
it
could
have
been
opened
either
with
the
assistance
of
a
stethoscope
which
catches
the
sound
of
the
tumbler
in
the
lock
or
by
a
person
of
acute
hearing
miss
thorne
sat
motionless
waiting
all
this
means
what
she
inquired
at
length
i
trouble
you
please
to
return
the
money
requested
grimm
courteously
no
reason
appears
why
you
should
have
taken
it
but
not
seeking
reasons
nor
am
i
seeking
disagreeable
publicity
only
the
money
it
seems
to
me
you
attach
undue
importance
to
the
handkerchief
she
objected
that
a
matter
of
opinion
grimm
remarked
it
would
be
useless
even
tedious
to
attempt
to
disprove
a
burglar
theory
but
against
it
is
the
difficulty
of
entrance
the
weight
of
the
gold
the
ingenious
method
of
opening
the
safe
and
the
assumption
that
not
more
than
six
persons
knew
the
money
was
in
the
safe
while
a
person
in
the
house
have
learned
it
in
any
of
a
dozen
ways
and
in
addition
is
the
fact
that
the
handkerchief
is
odd
therefore
noticeable
a
lace
expert
assures
me
there
probably
not
another
like
it
in
the
world
he
stopped
miss
thorne
eyes
sparkled
and
a
smile
seemed
to
be
tugging
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
she
spread
out
the
handkerchief
on
her
knees
you
could
identify
this
again
of
course
she
queried
yes
she
thoughtfully
crumpled
up
the
bit
of
lace
in
both
hands
then
opened
them
there
were
two
handkerchiefs
now
they
were
identical
which
is
it
please
she
asked
if
grimm
was
disappointed
there
was
not
a
trace
of
it
on
his
face
she
laughed
outright
gleefully
mockingly
then
demurely
pardon
me
you
see
it
absurd
the
handkerchief
the
butler
restored
to
me
at
dinner
after
i
lost
one
in
the
se√±or
office
might
have
been
either
of
these
or
one
of
ten
other
duplicates
in
my
room
all
given
to
me
by
her
maj
i
mean
she
corrected
quickly
by
a
friend
in
europe
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
is
that
all
no
replied
grimm
gravely
decisively
i
not
satisfied
i
shall
insist
upon
the
return
of
the
money
and
if
it
is
not
forthcoming
i
dare
say
count
di
rosini
the
italian
ambassador
would
be
pleased
to
give
his
personal
check
rather
than
have
the
matter
become
public
she
started
to
interrupt
he
went
on
in
any
event
you
will
be
requested
to
leave
the
country
then
and
not
until
then
a
decided
change
came
over
miss
thorne
face
a
deeper
color
leaped
to
her
cheeks
the
smile
faded
from
her
lips
and
there
was
a
flash
of
uneasiness
in
her
eyes
but
if
i
am
innocent
she
protested
you
must
prove
it
continued
grimm
mercilessly
personally
i
am
convinced
and
count
di
rosini
has
practically
assured
me
that
it
unjust
she
interrupted
passionately
it
it
you
have
proved
nothing
it
unheard
of
it
beyond
suddenly
she
became
silent
a
minute
two
minutes
three
minutes
passed
grimm
waited
patiently
will
you
give
me
time
and
opportunity
to
prove
my
innocence
she
demanded
finally
and
if
i
convince
you
i
should
be
delighted
to
believe
that
i
have
made
a
mistake
grimm
assured
her
how
much
time
one
day
two
days
i
will
let
you
know
within
an
hour
at
your
office
she
told
him
grimm
rose
and
meanwhile
in
case
of
accident
i
shall
look
to
count
di
rosini
for
adjustment
he
added
pointedly
good
morning
one
hour
and
ten
minutes
later
he
received
this
note
unsigned
closed
carriage
will
stop
for
you
at
southeast
corner
of
pennsylvania
avenue
and
fourteenth
street
at
one
he
was
there
the
carriage
was
on
time
and
my
lady
of
mystery
was
inside
he
stepped
in
and
they
swung
out
into
pennsylvania
avenue
noiselessly
over
the
asphalt
should
the
gold
be
placed
in
your
hands
now
within
the
hour
she
queried
solicitously
would
it
be
necessary
for
you
to
know
who
was
the
the
thief
it
would
grimm
responded
without
hesitation
even
if
it
destroyed
a
reputation
she
pleaded
the
secret
service
rarely
destroys
a
reputation
miss
thorne
although
it
holds
itself
in
readiness
to
do
so
i
dare
say
in
this
case
there
would
be
no
arrest
or
prosecution
because
of
of
reasons
which
appear
to
be
good
there
would
and
there
was
a
note
of
eagerness
in
her
voice
the
identity
of
the
guilty
person
would
never
appear
it
would
become
a
matter
of
record
in
our
office
but
beyond
that
i
think
not
at
least
in
this
one
instance
miss
thorne
sat
silent
for
a
block
or
more
you
admit
grimm
that
you
have
forced
me
into
a
most
remarkable
position
you
seemed
convinced
of
my
guilt
and
if
you
pardon
me
without
reason
then
you
made
it
compulsory
upon
me
to
establish
my
innocence
the
only
way
for
me
to
do
that
was
to
find
the
guilty
one
i
have
done
it
and
i
sorry
because
it
a
little
tragedy
grimm
waited
it
a
girl
high
in
diplomatic
society
her
father
position
is
an
honorable
rather
than
a
lucrative
one
he
has
no
fortune
this
girl
moves
in
a
certain
set
devoted
to
bridge
and
stakes
are
high
she
played
and
won
and
played
and
won
and
on
and
on
until
her
winnings
were
about
eight
thousand
dollars
then
luck
turned
she
began
to
lose
her
money
went
but
she
continued
to
play
desperately
finally
some
old
family
jewels
were
pawned
without
her
father
knowledge
and
ultimately
they
were
lost
one
day
she
awoke
to
the
fact
that
she
owed
some
nine
or
ten
thousand
dollars
in
bridge
debts
they
were
pressing
and
there
was
no
way
to
meet
them
this
meant
exposure
and
utter
ruin
and
women
do
strange
things
grimm
to
postpone
such
an
ending
to
social
aspirations
i
know
this
much
is
true
for
she
related
it
all
to
me
herself
at
last
in
some
way
a
misplaced
letter
perhaps
or
a
word
overheard
she
learned
that
fifty
thousand
dollars
would
be
in
the
legation
safe
overnight
and
evidently
she
learned
the
precise
night
she
paused
a
moment
here
is
the
address
of
a
man
in
baltimore
thomas
griswold
and
she
passed
a
card
to
grimm
who
sat
motionless
listening
about
four
years
ago
the
combination
on
the
legation
safe
was
changed
this
man
was
sent
here
to
make
the
change
therefore
some
one
besides
se√±or
rodriguez
know
the
combination
i
have
communicated
with
this
man
for
i
saw
the
possibility
of
just
such
a
thing
as
this
instead
of
your
stethoscope
by
a
trick
and
a
forged
letter
this
girl
obtained
the
combination
from
this
man
grimm
drew
a
long
breath
she
intended
to
take
perhaps
only
what
she
desperately
needed
but
at
sight
of
it
all
do
you
see
what
must
have
been
the
temptation
then
we
get
out
here
there
were
many
unanswered
questions
in
grimm
mind
he
repressed
them
for
the
time
stepped
out
and
assisted
miss
thorne
to
alight
the
carriage
had
turned
out
of
pennsylvania
avenue
and
at
the
moment
he
did
quite
place
himself
a
narrow
passageway
opened
before
them
evidently
the
rear
entrance
to
a
house
possibly
in
the
next
street
miss
thorne
led
the
way
unhesitatingly
cautiously
unlocked
the
door
and
together
they
entered
a
hall
then
there
was
a
short
flight
of
stairs
and
they
stepped
into
a
room
one
of
a
suite
she
closed
the
door
and
turned
on
the
lights
the
bags
of
gold
are
in
the
next
room
she
said
with
the
utmost
composure
grimm
dragged
them
out
of
a
dark
closet
opened
one
there
were
ten
and
allowed
the
coins
to
dribble
through
his
fingers
finally
he
turned
and
stared
at
miss
thorne
who
pallid
and
weary
stood
looking
on
where
are
we
he
asked
what
house
is
this
the
venezuelan
legation
she
answered
we
are
standing
less
than
forty
feet
from
the
safe
that
was
robbed
you
see
how
easy
and
whose
room
inquired
grimm
slowly
must
i
answer
she
asked
appealingly
you
must
se√±orita
rodriguez
my
hostess
do
you
see
what
you
made
me
do
she
and
cadwallader
made
the
trip
to
baltimore
in
his
automobile
and
and
she
stopped
he
knows
nothing
of
it
she
added
yes
i
know
said
grimm
he
stood
looking
at
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
staring
deeply
into
the
pleading
eyes
and
a
certain
tense
expression
about
his
lips
passed
for
an
instant
her
hand
trembled
on
his
arm
and
he
caught
the
fragrance
of
her
hair
where
is
she
now
he
asked
playing
bridge
replied
miss
thorne
with
a
sad
little
smile
it
is
always
so
at
least
twice
a
week
and
she
rarely
returns
before
two
or
she
extended
both
hands
impetuously
entreatingly
please
be
generous
grimm
you
have
the
gold
do
destroy
her
se√±or
rodriguez
the
minister
from
venezuela
found
the
gold
in
his
safe
on
the
following
morning
with
a
brief
note
from
grimm
in
which
there
was
no
explanation
of
how
or
where
it
had
been
found
and
two
hours
later
monsieur
boiss√©gur
ambassador
from
france
to
the
united
states
disappeared
from
the
embassy
vanished
xii
the
vanishing
diplomatist
it
was
three
days
after
the
ambassador
disappearance
that
monsieur
rigolot
secretary
of
the
french
embassy
and
temporary
reported
the
matter
to
chief
campbell
in
the
secret
service
bureau
adding
thereto
a
detailed
statement
of
several
singular
incidents
following
close
upon
it
he
told
it
in
order
concisely
and
to
the
point
while
grimm
and
his
chief
listened
monsieur
boiss√©gur
the
ambassador
you
understand
is
a
man
whose
habits
are
remarkably
regular
he
began
he
has
made
it
a
rule
to
be
at
his
desk
every
morning
at
ten
and
between
that
time
and
one
he
dictates
his
correspondence
and
clears
up
whatever
routine
work
there
is
before
him
i
have
known
him
for
many
years
and
have
been
secretary
of
the
embassy
under
him
in
germany
and
japan
and
this
country
i
have
never
known
him
to
vary
this
general
order
of
work
unless
because
of
illness
or
necessary
absence
well
monsieur
last
tuesday
this
is
friday
the
ambassador
was
at
his
desk
as
usual
he
dictated
a
dozen
or
more
letters
and
had
begun
another
a
private
letter
to
his
sister
in
paris
he
was
well
along
in
this
letter
when
without
any
apparent
reason
he
rose
from
his
desk
and
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
his
impression
was
that
some
detail
of
business
had
occurred
to
him
and
he
had
gone
into
the
general
office
farther
down
the
hall
to
attend
to
it
i
may
say
monsieur
that
this
impression
seemed
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
he
left
a
fresh
cigarette
burning
in
his
ash
tray
and
his
pen
was
behind
his
ear
it
was
all
as
if
he
had
merely
stepped
out
intending
to
return
immediately
the
sort
of
thing
monsieur
that
any
man
might
have
done
it
so
happened
that
when
he
went
out
he
left
a
sentence
of
his
letter
incomplete
i
tell
you
this
to
show
that
the
impulse
to
go
must
have
been
a
sudden
one
yet
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
so
his
stenographer
says
to
indicate
excitement
or
any
other
than
his
usual
frame
of
mind
it
was
about
five
minutes
of
twelve
high
noon
when
he
went
out
when
he
did
return
immediately
the
stenographer
began
transcribing
the
letters
at
one
monsieur
boiss√©gur
still
had
not
returned
and
his
stenographer
went
to
luncheon
as
he
talked
some
inbred
excitement
seemed
to
be
growing
upon
him
due
perhaps
to
his
recital
of
the
facts
and
he
paused
at
last
to
regain
control
of
himself
incidentally
he
wondered
if
grimm
was
taking
the
slightest
interest
in
what
he
was
saying
certainly
there
was
nothing
in
his
impassive
face
to
indicate
it
understand
monsieur
the
secretary
continued
after
a
moment
that
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
all
this
until
late
that
afternoon
that
is
tuesday
afternoon
about
five
i
was
engaged
all
day
upon
some
important
work
in
my
own
office
and
had
had
no
occasion
to
see
monsieur
boiss√©gur
since
a
word
or
so
when
he
came
in
at
ten
my
attention
was
called
to
the
affair
finally
by
his
stenographer
monsieur
netterville
who
came
to
me
for
instructions
he
had
finished
the
letters
and
the
ambassador
had
not
returned
to
sign
them
at
this
point
i
began
an
investigation
monsieur
and
the
further
i
went
the
more
uneasy
i
grew
now
monsieur
there
are
only
two
entrances
to
the
embassy
the
front
door
where
a
servant
is
in
constant
attendance
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
ten
at
night
and
the
rear
door
which
can
only
be
reached
through
the
kitchen
neither
of
the
two
men
who
had
been
stationed
at
the
front
door
had
seen
the
ambassador
since
breakfast
therefore
he
could
not
have
gone
out
that
way
it
seemed
ridiculous
monsieur
but
then
i
went
to
the
kitchen
the
had
been
there
all
day
and
he
had
not
seen
the
ambassador
at
all
i
inquired
further
no
one
in
the
embassy
not
a
clerk
nor
a
servant
nor
a
member
of
the
family
had
seen
him
since
he
left
his
office
again
he
paused
and
ran
one
hand
across
his
troubled
brow
monsieur
he
went
on
and
there
was
a
tense
note
in
his
voice
the
ambassador
of
france
had
disappeared
gone
vanished
we
searched
the
house
from
the
cellar
to
the
servants
quarters
even
the
roof
but
there
was
no
trace
of
him
the
hat
he
usually
wore
was
in
the
hall
and
all
his
other
hats
were
accounted
for
you
may
remember
monsieur
that
tuesday
was
cold
but
all
his
were
found
in
their
proper
places
so
it
seems
monsieur
and
repression
ended
in
a
burst
of
excitement
if
he
left
the
embassy
he
did
not
go
out
by
either
door
and
he
went
without
hat
or
coat
he
stopped
helplessly
and
his
gaze
alternated
inquiringly
between
the
benevolent
face
of
the
chief
and
the
expressionless
countenance
of
grimm
he
left
the
embassy
grimm
repeated
if
your
search
of
the
house
proved
conclusively
that
he
was
there
he
leave
it
did
he
monsieur
rigolot
stared
at
him
blankly
for
a
moment
then
nodded
and
there
are
windows
you
know
grimm
went
on
then
as
i
understand
it
monsieur
no
one
except
you
and
the
stenographer
saw
the
ambassador
after
ten
in
the
morning
monsieur
monsieur
rigolot
began
excitedly
i
beg
pardon
i
believe
that
is
correct
you
saw
him
about
ten
you
say
therefore
no
one
except
the
stenographer
saw
him
after
ten
that
is
also
true
as
far
as
i
know
any
callers
letters
telegrams
telephone
messages
i
made
inquiries
in
that
direction
monsieur
was
the
reply
i
have
the
words
of
the
servants
at
the
door
and
of
the
stenographer
that
there
were
no
callers
and
the
statement
of
the
stenographer
that
there
were
no
telephone
calls
or
telegrams
there
were
only
four
letters
for
him
personally
he
left
them
all
on
his
desk
here
they
are
grimm
looked
them
over
leisurely
they
were
commonplace
enough
containing
nothing
that
might
be
construed
into
a
reason
for
the
disappearance
the
letters
monsieur
boiss√©gur
had
dictated
were
laid
on
his
desk
by
the
stenographer
monsieur
rigolot
rushed
on
volubly
excitedly
in
the
anxiety
and
uneasiness
following
the
disappearance
they
were
allowed
to
remain
there
overnight
on
wednesday
morning
monsieur
and
he
hesitated
impressively
letters
bore
his
signature
in
his
own
grimm
turned
his
listless
eyes
full
upon
monsieur
perturbed
face
for
one
scant
instant
no
doubt
of
it
being
his
signature
he
queried
monsieur
non
the
secretary
exclaimed
emphatically
that
is
i
have
known
his
signature
for
years
there
is
no
doubt
the
letters
were
not
of
a
private
nature
if
you
would
care
to
look
at
copies
of
them
he
offered
the
duplicates
tentatively
grimm
read
them
over
slowly
the
while
monsieur
rigolot
sat
nervously
staring
at
him
they
too
seemed
meaningless
as
bearing
on
the
matter
in
hand
finally
grimm
nodded
and
monsieur
rigolot
resumed
and
wednesday
night
monsieur
another
strange
thing
happened
monsieur
boiss√©gur
smokes
many
cigarettes
of
a
kind
made
especially
for
him
in
france
and
shipped
to
him
here
he
keeps
them
in
a
case
on
his
on
thursday
morning
his
valet
reported
to
me
that
case
of
cigarettes
had
of
course
observed
grimm
monsieur
boiss√©gur
has
a
to
the
embassy
of
course
anything
unusual
happen
last
night
that
is
thursday
night
nothing
monsieur
that
is
nothing
we
can
find
grimm
was
silent
for
a
time
and
fell
to
twisting
the
seal
ring
on
his
finger
campbell
turned
around
and
moved
a
paper
weight
one
inch
to
the
left
where
it
belonged
while
monsieur
rigolot
disappointed
at
their
amazing
apathy
squirmed
uneasily
in
his
chair
it
would
appear
then
grimm
remarked
musingly
that
after
his
mysterious
disappearance
the
ambassador
has
either
twice
returned
to
his
house
at
night
or
else
sent
some
one
there
first
to
bring
the
letters
to
him
for
signature
and
later
to
get
his
cigarettes
i
mean
that
seems
to
be
true
but
where
is
he
why
should
he
not
come
back
what
does
it
mean
madame
boiss√©gur
is
frantic
prostrated
she
wanted
me
to
go
to
the
police
but
i
did
not
think
it
wise
that
it
should
become
public
so
i
came
here
very
well
commented
grimm
let
it
rest
as
it
is
meanwhile
you
may
reassure
madame
point
out
to
her
that
if
monsieur
boiss√©gur
signed
the
letters
tuesday
night
he
was
at
least
alive
and
if
he
came
or
sent
for
the
cigarettes
wednesday
night
he
was
still
alive
i
shall
call
at
the
embassy
this
afternoon
no
it
is
advisable
to
go
with
you
now
give
me
your
please
monsieur
rigolot
produced
the
key
and
passed
it
over
without
a
word
and
one
other
thing
grimm
continued
please
collect
all
the
revolvers
that
may
be
in
the
house
and
take
charge
of
them
yourself
if
any
one
by
chance
heard
a
burglar
prowling
around
there
he
might
shoot
and
in
that
event
either
kill
monsieur
boiss√©gur
or
or
me
when
the
secretary
had
gone
campbell
idly
drummed
on
his
desk
as
he
studied
the
face
of
his
subordinate
so
much
he
commented
finally
it
miss
thorne
again
said
the
young
man
as
if
answering
a
question
perhaps
these
reports
i
have
received
from
the
latin
capitals
may
aid
you
in
dispelling
that
mystery
campbell
suggested
and
grimm
turned
to
them
eagerly
meanwhile
our
royal
visitor
prince
benedetto
remains
unknown
the
young
man
teeth
closed
with
a
snap
it
only
a
question
of
time
chief
he
said
abruptly
i
find
him
i
find
him
and
he
sat
down
to
read
the
reports
xiii
a
conference
in
the
dark
the
white
rays
of
a
distant
arc
light
filtered
through
the
velvet
hangings
and
laid
a
faintly
illumined
path
across
the
ambassador
desk
the
heavy
leather
chairs
were
mere
impalpable
splotches
in
the
shadows
the
knobs
of
a
mahogany
cabinet
caught
the
glint
of
light
and
reflected
it
dimly
outside
was
the
vague
indefinable
night
drone
of
a
city
asleep
unbroken
by
any
sound
that
was
distinguishable
until
finally
there
came
the
distant
boom
of
a
clock
it
struck
twice
seated
on
a
couch
in
one
corner
of
the
ambassador
office
was
grimm
he
was
leaning
against
the
high
arm
of
leather
with
his
feet
on
the
seat
thoughtfully
nursing
his
knees
if
his
attitude
indicated
anything
except
sheer
comfort
it
was
that
he
was
listening
he
had
been
there
for
two
hours
and
absolutely
motionless
five
ten
fifteen
minutes
more
passed
and
then
grimm
heard
the
grind
and
whir
of
an
automobile
a
block
or
so
away
coming
toward
the
embassy
now
it
was
in
front
honk
it
called
plaintively
honk
the
signal
at
last
the
automobile
went
rushing
on
full
tilt
while
grimm
removed
his
feet
from
the
seat
and
dropped
them
noiselessly
to
the
floor
thus
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
listening
listening
with
every
faculty
strained
he
sat
motionless
peering
toward
the
open
door
that
led
into
the
hall
the
car
was
gone
now
the
sound
of
it
was
swallowed
up
in
the
distance
still
he
sat
there
it
was
obviously
some
noise
in
the
house
for
which
he
was
waiting
minute
after
minute
passed
and
still
nothing
there
was
not
even
the
whisper
of
a
drapery
he
was
about
to
rise
when
suddenly
with
no
other
noise
than
that
of
the
sharp
click
of
the
switch
the
electric
lights
in
the
room
blazed
up
brilliantly
the
glare
dazzled
grimm
with
its
blinding
flood
but
he
did
move
then
softly
almost
in
a
whisper
good
evening
mr
grimm
it
was
a
woman
voice
pleasant
unsurprised
perfectly
modulated
grimm
certainly
did
not
expect
it
now
but
he
knew
it
instantly
there
was
not
another
quite
like
it
in
the
wide
wide
world
and
though
he
was
still
blinking
a
little
he
came
to
his
feet
courteously
good
morning
miss
thorne
he
corrected
gravely
now
his
vision
was
clearing
and
he
saw
her
a
graceful
figure
silhouetted
against
the
rich
green
of
the
wall
draperies
her
lips
were
curled
the
least
bit
as
if
she
might
have
been
smiling
and
her
wonderful
eyes
reflected
a
glint
of
of
was
it
amusement
the
folds
of
her
evening
dress
fell
away
from
her
and
one
bare
white
arm
was
extended
as
her
hand
still
rested
on
the
switch
and
you
did
hear
me
still
in
the
half
whisper
i
did
think
you
would
now
i
going
to
put
out
the
lights
for
an
instant
while
you
pull
the
shades
down
and
then
then
we
must
have
a
a
conference
the
switch
snapped
the
lights
died
as
suddenly
as
they
had
been
born
and
grimm
moving
noiselessly
visited
each
of
the
four
windows
in
turn
then
the
lights
blazed
brilliantly
again
just
for
a
moment
miss
thorne
explained
to
him
quietly
and
she
handed
him
a
sheet
of
paper
i
want
you
to
read
this
read
it
carefully
then
i
shall
turn
out
the
lights
again
they
are
dangerous
after
that
we
may
discuss
the
matter
at
our
leisure
grimm
read
the
paper
while
miss
thorne
eyes
questioned
his
impassive
face
at
length
he
looked
up
indolently
listlessly
and
the
switch
snapped
she
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
grimm
sat
beside
her
i
think
miss
thorne
suggested
tentatively
that
that
accounts
perfectly
for
monsieur
boiss√©gur
disappearance
it
gives
one
explanation
at
least
grimm
assented
musingly
kidnapped
held
prisoner
fifty
thousand
dollars
demanded
for
his
safety
and
release
a
pause
and
to
whom
may
i
ask
was
this
demand
addressed
to
madame
boiss√©gur
replied
miss
thorne
i
have
the
envelope
in
which
it
came
it
was
mailed
at
the
general
at
one
this
afternoon
so
the
canceling
stamp
shows
and
the
envelope
was
addressed
as
the
letter
was
written
on
a
typewriter
and
how
inquired
grimm
after
a
long
pause
how
did
it
come
into
your
possession
he
waited
a
little
why
did
monsieur
rigolot
report
this
development
to
me
this
afternoon
when
i
was
here
monsieur
rigolot
did
not
inform
you
of
it
because
he
did
know
of
it
himself
she
replied
answering
the
last
question
first
it
came
into
my
possession
directly
from
the
hands
of
madame
boiss√©gur
she
gave
it
to
me
why
grimm
was
peering
through
the
inscrutable
darkness
straight
into
her
face
a
white
daub
in
the
gloom
shapeless
indistinct
i
have
known
madame
boiss√©gur
for
half
a
dozen
years
miss
thorne
continued
in
explanation
we
have
been
friends
that
long
i
met
her
first
in
tokio
later
in
berlin
and
within
a
few
weeks
here
in
washington
you
see
i
have
traveled
in
the
time
i
have
been
an
agent
for
my
government
well
madame
boiss√©gur
received
this
letter
about
four
this
afternoon
and
about
five
she
sent
for
me
and
placed
it
in
my
hands
together
with
all
the
singular
details
following
upon
the
ambassador
disappearance
so
it
would
seem
that
you
and
i
are
allies
for
this
once
and
the
problem
is
already
solved
there
merely
remains
the
task
of
finding
and
releasing
the
ambassador
grimm
sat
perfectly
still
and
why
he
asked
slowly
are
you
here
now
for
the
same
reason
that
you
are
here
she
replied
readily
to
see
for
myself
if
the
the
person
who
twice
came
here
at
night
once
for
the
ambassador
letters
and
once
for
his
cigarettes
would
by
any
chance
make
another
trip
i
knew
you
were
here
of
course
you
knew
i
was
here
repeated
grimm
musingly
and
may
i
just
as
you
knew
that
i
or
some
one
at
least
had
entered
this
house
a
few
minutes
ago
she
interrupted
the
automobile
horn
outside
was
a
signal
was
it
hastings
was
in
the
car
or
was
it
blair
or
johnson
grimm
did
not
say
did
you
anticipate
any
personal
danger
when
you
entered
he
queried
instead
were
you
afraid
i
might
shoot
no
there
was
a
long
silence
grimm
still
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
staring
staring
at
the
vague
white
splotch
which
was
miss
thorne
face
and
bare
neck
one
of
her
white
arms
hung
at
her
side
like
a
pallid
serpent
and
her
hand
was
at
rest
on
the
seat
of
the
couch
it
seems
miss
thorne
he
said
at
length
casually
quite
casually
that
our
paths
of
duty
are
inextricably
tangled
twice
previously
we
have
met
under
circumstances
that
were
more
than
strange
and
now
this
whatever
injustice
i
may
have
done
you
in
the
past
by
my
suspicions
has
i
hope
been
forgiven
and
in
each
instance
we
were
able
to
work
side
by
side
toward
a
conclusion
i
am
wondering
now
if
this
singular
affair
will
take
a
similar
course
he
paused
miss
thorne
started
to
speak
but
he
silenced
her
with
a
slight
gesture
of
his
hand
it
is
only
fair
to
you
to
say
that
we
that
is
the
secret
service
have
learned
many
things
about
you
he
resumed
in
the
same
casual
tone
we
have
through
our
foreign
agents
traced
you
step
by
step
from
rome
to
washington
we
know
that
you
are
in
a
way
a
representative
of
a
sovereign
of
europe
we
know
that
you
were
on
a
secret
mission
to
the
spanish
court
perhaps
for
this
sovereign
and
remained
in
madrid
for
a
month
we
know
that
from
there
you
went
to
paris
also
on
a
secret
mission
perhaps
the
same
and
remained
there
for
three
weeks
we
know
that
you
met
diplomatic
agents
of
those
governments
later
in
london
we
know
all
this
we
know
the
manner
of
your
coming
to
this
country
of
your
coming
to
washington
but
we
know
you
are
here
again
she
started
to
speak
and
again
he
stopped
her
we
do
know
your
name
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
we
know
that
in
spain
you
were
se√±ora
cassavant
in
paris
mademoiselle
in
london
miss
jane
kellog
and
here
miss
isabel
thorne
we
realize
that
exigencies
arise
in
your
calling
and
mine
which
make
changes
of
name
desirable
necessary
even
and
there
is
no
criticism
of
that
now
as
the
representative
of
your
government
rather
government
you
have
a
right
to
be
here
although
unaccredited
you
have
a
right
to
remain
here
as
long
as
your
acts
are
consistent
with
our
laws
you
have
a
right
to
your
secrets
as
long
as
they
do
not
directly
or
indirectly
threaten
the
welfare
of
this
country
now
why
are
you
here
he
received
no
answer
he
expected
none
after
a
moment
he
went
on
admitting
that
you
are
a
secret
agent
of
italy
admitting
everything
that
you
claim
to
be
you
have
convinced
me
that
you
are
not
the
person
who
came
here
for
the
letters
and
cigarettes
you
have
said
nothing
to
prove
to
my
satisfaction
that
you
are
not
the
individual
i
was
waiting
for
you
do
mean
that
you
suspect
she
began
in
a
tone
of
amazement
i
do
mean
that
i
suspect
anything
he
interposed
i
mean
merely
that
you
have
convinced
me
there
nothing
inconsistent
in
the
fact
that
you
are
what
you
say
you
are
and
that
in
spite
of
that
you
came
for
he
was
interrupted
by
a
laugh
a
throaty
silvery
note
that
he
remembered
well
his
idle
hands
closed
spasmodically
only
to
be
instantly
relaxed
suppose
grimm
i
should
tell
you
that
immediately
after
madame
boiss√©gur
placed
the
matter
in
my
hands
this
afternoon
i
went
straight
to
your
office
to
show
this
letter
to
you
and
to
ask
your
assistance
she
inquired
suppose
that
i
left
my
card
for
you
with
a
clerk
there
on
being
informed
that
you
were
out
remember
i
knew
you
were
on
the
case
from
madame
boiss√©gur
would
that
indicate
anything
except
that
i
wanted
to
put
the
matter
squarely
before
you
and
work
with
you
we
will
suppose
that
much
grimm
agreed
that
is
a
statement
of
fact
miss
thorne
added
my
card
which
you
will
find
at
your
office
will
show
that
and
when
i
left
your
office
i
went
to
the
hotel
where
you
live
with
the
same
purpose
you
were
not
there
and
i
left
a
card
for
you
and
is
a
statement
of
fact
it
was
not
difficult
owing
to
the
extraordinary
circumstances
to
imagine
that
you
would
be
here
just
as
you
are
and
i
came
here
my
purpose
still
was
to
inform
you
of
what
i
knew
and
work
with
you
does
that
convince
you
and
how
did
you
enter
the
embassy
grimm
persisted
not
with
a
as
you
did
she
replied
madame
boiss√©gur
at
my
suggestion
left
the
french
window
in
the
hall
there
unfastened
and
i
came
in
that
way
the
way
i
may
add
that
went
out
when
he
disappeared
very
well
commented
grimm
and
finally
i
think
perhaps
i
owe
you
an
apology
miss
thorne
another
one
the
circumstances
now
as
they
were
at
our
previous
meetings
are
so
unusual
that
is
it
necessary
to
go
on
there
was
a
certain
growing
deference
in
his
tone
i
wonder
if
you
account
for
monsieur
boiss√©gur
disappearance
as
i
do
he
inquired
i
dare
say
and
miss
thorne
leaned
toward
him
with
sudden
eagerness
in
her
manner
and
voice
your
theory
is
she
questioned
if
we
believe
the
servants
we
know
that
monsieur
boiss√©gur
did
not
go
out
either
by
the
front
door
or
rear
grimm
explained
that
being
true
the
french
window
by
which
you
entered
seems
to
have
been
the
way
yes
yes
miss
thorne
interpolated
and
the
circumstances
attending
the
disappearance
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
he
went
evidently
of
his
own
will
precisely
as
you
must
account
for
it
if
you
have
studied
the
situation
here
as
i
have
responded
grimm
for
instance
sitting
at
his
desk
there
and
he
turned
to
indicate
it
he
could
readily
see
out
the
windows
overlooking
the
street
there
is
only
a
narrow
strip
of
lawn
between
the
house
and
the
sidewalk
now
if
some
one
on
the
sidewalk
or
or
in
a
carriage
promptly
suggested
miss
thorne
or
in
a
carriage
grimm
supplemented
had
attracted
his
attention
some
one
he
knew
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
he
rose
for
no
apparent
reason
as
he
did
do
passed
along
the
hall
and
through
the
french
window
across
the
lawn
to
the
carriage
and
not
a
person
in
the
house
would
have
seen
him
go
out
precisely
there
seems
no
doubt
that
was
the
way
she
mused
and
of
course
he
must
have
entered
the
carriage
of
his
own
free
will
in
other
words
on
some
pretext
or
other
he
was
lured
in
then
made
prisoner
and
he
paused
suddenly
and
his
hand
met
miss
thorne
warningly
the
silence
of
the
night
was
broken
by
the
violent
clatter
of
footsteps
apparently
approaching
the
embassy
the
noise
was
unmistakable
some
one
was
running
the
window
miss
thorne
whispered
she
rose
quickly
and
started
to
cross
the
room
to
look
out
grimm
sat
motionless
listening
an
instant
later
and
there
came
a
tremendous
crash
of
glass
the
french
window
in
the
hallway
by
the
sound
then
rapid
footsteps
still
running
along
the
hall
grimm
moved
toward
the
door
unruffled
perfectly
there
was
only
a
narrowing
of
his
eyes
at
the
abruptness
and
clatter
of
it
all
and
then
the
electric
lights
in
the
hall
flashed
up
before
grimm
stood
a
man
framed
by
the
doorway
staring
unseeingly
into
the
darkened
room
his
face
was
haggard
and
white
as
death
his
mouth
agape
as
if
from
exertion
and
the
lips
bloodless
his
eyes
were
widely
distended
as
if
from
fright
clothing
disarranged
collar
unfastened
and
dangling
the
ambassador
miss
thorne
whispered
thrillingly
xiv
a
rescue
and
an
escape
miss
thorne
voice
startled
grimm
a
little
but
he
had
no
doubts
it
was
monsieur
boiss√©gur
grimm
was
going
toward
the
enframed
figure
when
without
any
apparent
reason
the
ambassador
turned
and
ran
along
the
hall
and
at
that
instant
the
lights
went
out
again
for
one
moment
grimm
stood
still
dazed
and
blinded
by
the
sudden
blackness
and
again
he
started
toward
the
door
miss
thorne
was
beside
him
the
lights
he
whispered
tensely
find
the
switch
he
heard
the
rustle
of
her
skirts
as
she
moved
away
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
feeling
with
both
his
hands
along
the
wall
a
few
feet
away
in
the
direction
the
ambassador
had
gone
there
seemed
to
be
a
violent
struggle
in
progress
there
was
the
scuffling
of
feet
and
breaths
as
muscle
strained
against
muscle
the
lights
if
he
could
only
find
the
switch
then
as
his
hands
moved
along
the
wall
they
came
in
contact
with
another
hand
a
hand
pressed
firmly
against
the
plastering
barring
his
progress
a
light
blow
in
the
face
caused
him
to
step
back
quickly
the
scuffling
sound
suddenly
resolved
itself
into
moving
footsteps
and
the
front
door
opened
and
closed
with
a
bang
grimm
listless
eyes
snapped
and
his
white
teeth
came
together
sharply
as
he
started
toward
the
front
door
but
fate
seemed
to
be
against
him
still
he
stumbled
over
a
chair
and
his
own
impetus
forward
sent
him
sprawling
his
head
struck
the
wall
with
a
resounding
whack
and
then
over
the
house
came
utter
silence
from
outside
he
heard
the
clatter
of
a
cab
finally
that
died
away
in
the
distance
miss
thorne
he
inquired
quietly
i
here
she
answered
in
a
despairing
voice
but
i
ca
find
the
switch
are
you
hurt
no
and
then
she
found
the
switch
the
lights
flared
up
grimm
was
sitting
thoughtfully
on
the
floor
that
simplifies
the
matter
considerably
he
observed
complacently
as
he
rose
the
men
who
signaled
to
me
when
you
entered
the
embassy
will
never
let
that
cab
get
out
of
their
sight
miss
thorne
stood
leaning
forward
a
little
eagerly
gazing
at
him
with
those
wonderful
eyes
and
an
expression
of
of
perhaps
it
was
admiration
on
her
face
are
you
sure
she
demanded
at
last
i
know
it
was
his
response
and
just
then
monsieur
rigolot
secretary
of
the
embassy
thrust
an
inquisitive
head
timidly
around
the
corner
of
the
stairs
the
crash
of
glass
had
aroused
him
what
happened
he
asked
breathlessly
we
do
know
just
yet
replied
grimm
if
the
noise
aroused
any
one
else
please
assure
them
that
there
nothing
the
matter
and
you
might
inform
madame
boiss√©gur
that
the
ambassador
will
return
home
good
night
at
his
hotel
when
he
reached
there
grimm
found
miss
card
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
at
his
office
he
found
another
of
her
cards
and
he
drew
another
long
breath
he
did
like
corroborative
details
did
grimm
and
of
course
this
on
the
following
day
miss
thorne
accompanied
him
to
alexandria
and
they
were
driven
in
a
closed
carriage
out
toward
the
western
edge
of
the
city
finally
the
carriage
stopped
at
a
signal
from
grimm
and
he
assisted
miss
thorne
out
after
which
he
turned
and
spoke
to
some
one
remaining
inside
a
man
the
house
is
two
blocks
west
along
that
street
there
he
explained
and
he
indicated
an
intersecting
thoroughfare
just
ahead
it
is
number
five
minutes
after
we
enter
you
will
drive
up
in
front
of
the
door
and
wait
if
we
do
return
in
fifteen
minutes
come
in
after
us
do
you
anticipate
danger
miss
thorne
queried
quickly
if
i
had
anticipated
danger
replied
grimm
i
should
not
have
permitted
you
to
come
with
me
they
entered
the
house
number
with
a
key
which
grimm
produced
and
a
minute
or
so
later
walked
into
a
room
where
three
men
were
sitting
one
of
them
was
of
a
coarse
repulsive
type
large
and
heavy
another
rather
dapper
of
superficial
polish
evidently
a
foreigner
and
the
third
the
third
was
ambassador
boiss√©gur
good
morning
gentlemen
grimm
greeted
them
then
ceremoniously
monsieur
boiss√©gur
your
carriage
is
at
the
door
the
three
men
came
to
their
feet
instantly
and
one
of
them
he
of
the
heavy
face
drew
a
revolver
grimm
faced
him
placidly
do
you
know
what
would
happen
to
you
if
you
killed
me
he
inquired
pleasantly
you
would
live
three
minutes
do
you
imagine
i
came
in
here
blindly
there
are
a
dozen
men
guarding
the
entrances
to
the
house
a
pistol
shot
would
bring
them
in
put
down
the
gun
eyes
challenged
eyes
for
one
long
tense
instant
and
the
man
carefully
laid
the
weapon
on
the
table
grimm
strolled
over
and
picked
it
up
after
which
he
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
other
man
the
second
guard
and
you
are
the
gentleman
i
dare
say
who
made
the
necessary
trips
to
the
ambassador
house
probably
using
his
he
remarked
interrogatively
first
for
the
letters
to
be
signed
and
again
for
the
cigarettes
there
was
no
answer
and
grimm
turned
questioningly
to
monsieur
boiss√©gur
silent
white
of
face
motionless
yes
monsieur
the
ambassador
burst
out
suddenly
his
eyes
were
fixed
unwaveringly
on
miss
thorne
and
your
escape
monsieur
continued
grimm
i
did
escape
monsieur
last
night
the
ambassador
explained
but
they
knew
it
immediately
they
pursued
me
into
my
own
house
these
two
and
another
and
dragged
me
back
here
dieu
monsieur
that
all
that
necessary
remarked
grimm
you
are
free
to
go
now
but
there
are
others
monsieur
boiss√©gur
interposed
desperately
two
more
somewhere
below
and
they
will
not
allow
they
will
attack
grimm
listless
eyes
narrowed
slightly
and
he
turned
to
miss
thorne
she
was
a
little
white
but
he
saw
enough
in
her
face
to
satisfy
him
i
shall
escort
monsieur
boiss√©gur
to
his
carriage
miss
thorne
he
said
calmly
these
men
will
remain
here
until
i
return
take
the
revolver
if
either
of
them
so
much
as
wags
his
head
you
are
not
not
afraid
no
she
smiled
faintly
i
am
not
afraid
grimm
and
the
ambassador
went
down
the
stairs
and
out
the
front
door
grimm
was
just
turning
to
reenter
the
house
when
from
above
came
a
muffled
venomous
a
shot
he
took
the
steps
going
up
two
at
a
time
miss
thorne
was
leaning
against
the
wall
as
if
dazed
the
revolver
lay
at
her
feet
a
door
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
stood
open
and
the
clatter
of
footsteps
echoed
through
the
house
one
of
them
leaped
at
me
and
i
fired
she
gasped
in
explanation
he
struck
me
but
i
i
not
hurt
she
stooped
quickly
picked
up
the
revolver
and
made
as
if
to
follow
the
dying
footsteps
grimm
stopped
her
it
does
matter
he
said
quietly
let
them
go
and
after
a
while
earnestly
if
i
had
dreamed
of
such
a
such
a
thing
as
this
i
should
never
have
consented
to
allow
you
i
understand
she
interrupted
and
for
one
instant
her
outstretched
hand
rested
on
his
arm
the
ambassador
perfectly
safe
responded
grimm
two
of
my
men
are
with
him
xv
master
of
the
situation
as
the
women
rose
and
started
out
leaving
the
gentlemen
over
their
coffee
and
cigars
miss
thorne
paused
at
the
door
and
the
eyes
flashed
some
subtle
message
to
the
french
ambassador
who
after
an
instant
nodded
comprehendingly
then
resumed
his
conversation
as
he
left
the
room
a
few
minutes
later
he
noticed
that
grimm
had
joined
a
group
of
automaniacs
of
which
cadwallader
was
the
enthusiastic
center
he
spoke
to
his
hostess
the
wife
of
the
minister
from
portugal
for
a
moment
then
went
to
miss
thorne
and
dropped
into
a
seat
beside
her
she
greeted
him
with
a
smile
and
was
still
smiling
as
she
talked
i
believe
monsieur
she
said
in
french
you
sent
a
code
message
to
the
cable
office
this
afternoon
his
eyes
questioned
hers
quickly
and
please
bear
in
mind
that
we
probably
are
being
watched
as
we
talk
she
went
on
pleasantly
grimm
is
the
man
to
be
afraid
of
smile
do
look
so
serious
she
laughed
outright
yes
i
sent
a
code
message
he
replied
it
was
your
resignation
yes
well
it
was
sent
of
course
she
informed
him
and
her
eyes
were
sparkling
as
if
something
amusing
had
been
said
one
of
my
agents
stopped
it
i
may
add
that
it
will
not
be
sent
the
ambassador
eyes
grew
steely
then
blank
again
mademoiselle
what
am
i
to
understand
from
that
he
demanded
you
are
to
understand
that
i
am
absolute
master
of
the
situation
in
washington
at
this
moment
she
replied
positively
the
smile
on
her
lips
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
were
strangely
at
variance
from
the
beginning
i
let
you
understand
that
ultimately
you
would
receive
your
instructions
from
paris
now
i
know
they
will
reach
you
by
cable
within
a
week
the
compact
will
be
signed
whether
you
approve
of
it
or
not
it
will
be
signed
for
your
country
by
a
special
envoy
whose
authority
is
greater
than
yours
his
highness
the
prince
benedetto
has
he
reached
washington
he
is
in
washington
he
has
been
here
for
some
time
incognito
she
was
silent
a
moment
you
have
been
a
source
of
danger
to
our
plans
she
added
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
accident
you
would
still
have
been
comfortably
kept
out
in
alexandria
where
grimm
and
i
found
you
please
remember
monsieur
that
we
will
accomplish
what
we
set
out
to
do
nothing
can
stop
us
nothing
at
just
about
the
same
moment
the
name
of
prince
had
been
used
in
the
but
in
a
different
connection
cadwallader
was
reciting
some
incident
of
an
automobile
trip
in
italy
when
he
had
been
connected
with
the
british
embassy
there
the
prince
was
driving
he
said
and
one
of
the
best
i
ever
saw
corking
chap
the
prince
democratic
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
was
one
scion
of
royalty
who
did
mind
soiling
his
hands
by
diving
in
under
a
car
and
fixing
it
himself
at
that
time
he
was
inclined
to
be
wild
that
was
eight
or
nine
years
ago
but
they
say
now
he
has
settled
down
to
work
and
is
one
of
the
real
diplomatic
powers
of
italy
i
have
seen
him
for
a
half
dozen
years
how
old
a
man
is
he
asked
grimm
carelessly
perhaps
i
do
know
replied
cadwallader
it
odd
you
know
the
number
of
princes
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
one
can
find
knocking
about
in
italy
and
germany
and
spain
one
never
hears
of
half
of
them
i
never
had
heard
of
the
prince
until
i
went
to
italy
and
i
heard
jolly
well
little
of
him
since
except
indirectly
cadwallader
lapsed
into
silence
as
he
sat
staring
at
a
large
group
photograph
which
was
framed
on
a
wall
of
the
is
that
the
royal
family
of
italy
he
asked
he
rose
and
went
over
to
it
by
jove
it
is
and
here
is
the
prince
in
the
group
the
picture
was
taken
i
should
say
about
the
time
i
knew
him
grimm
strolled
over
idly
and
stood
for
a
long
time
staring
at
the
photograph
he
can
drive
a
motor
you
know
said
cadwallader
admiringly
and
italy
is
the
place
to
drive
them
they
forgot
to
make
any
speed
laws
over
there
and
if
a
chap
gets
in
your
way
and
you
knock
him
silly
they
arrest
him
for
obstructing
traffic
you
know
over
here
if
a
chap
really
starts
to
go
any
place
in
a
hurry
some
bally
idiot
holds
him
up
have
you
ever
been
held
up
queried
grimm
no
but
i
expect
to
be
every
day
was
the
reply
i
got
a
new
motor
you
know
and
i
never
been
able
to
see
how
fast
it
is
the
other
evening
i
ran
up
to
baltimore
with
it
in
an
hour
and
minutes
from
alexandria
to
druid
hill
park
and
that
better
than
forty
miles
i
never
did
let
the
motor
out
you
know
because
we
ran
in
the
dark
most
of
the
way
grimm
was
still
gazing
at
the
photograph
did
you
go
alone
he
asked
there
no
fun
motoring
alone
you
know
se√±orita
rodriguez
was
with
me
charming
girl
what
a
little
while
later
grimm
sauntered
out
into
the
and
made
his
way
toward
miss
thorne
and
the
french
ambassador
monsieur
boiss√©gur
rose
and
offered
his
hand
cordially
i
hope
monsieur
said
grimm
that
you
are
no
worse
off
for
your
your
unpleasant
experience
not
at
all
thanks
to
you
was
the
reply
i
have
just
thanked
miss
thorne
for
her
part
in
the
affair
and
i
glad
to
have
been
of
service
interrupted
grimm
lightly
the
ambassador
bowed
ceremoniously
and
moved
away
grimm
dropped
into
the
seat
he
had
just
left
you
left
the
legation
have
you
he
asked
you
drove
me
out
she
laughed
drove
you
out
he
repeated
drove
you
out
why
it
was
not
only
uncomfortable
but
it
was
rather
conspicuous
because
of
the
constant
espionage
of
your
blair
and
your
johnson
and
your
hastings
she
explained
still
laughing
so
i
have
moved
to
the
hotel
hilliard
grimm
was
twisting
the
seal
ring
on
his
little
finger
i
sorry
if
i
made
it
uncomfortable
for
you
he
apologized
you
see
it
necessary
to
no
explanation
miss
thorne
interrupted
i
understand
i
glad
you
do
he
replied
seriously
how
long
do
you
intend
to
remain
in
the
city
really
i
do
know
two
three
four
weeks
perhaps
why
i
was
just
wondering
se√±orita
rodriguez
came
toward
them
we
going
to
play
bridge
she
said
and
we
need
you
isabel
to
make
the
four
come
i
hate
to
take
her
away
mr
grimm
grimm
and
miss
thorne
rose
together
for
an
instant
her
slim
white
hand
rested
on
grimm
sleeve
and
she
stared
into
his
eyes
understandingly
with
a
little
of
melancholy
in
her
own
they
left
grimm
there
xvi
letters
from
jail
for
two
weeks
signor
pietro
petrozinni
known
to
the
secret
service
as
an
unaccredited
agent
of
the
italian
government
and
the
assailant
of
se√±or
alvarez
of
the
mexican
legation
had
been
taking
his
ease
in
a
cell
he
had
been
formally
arraigned
and
committed
without
bail
to
await
the
result
of
the
bullet
wound
which
had
been
inflicted
upon
the
diplomatist
from
mexico
at
the
german
embassy
ball
and
since
then
undisturbed
and
apparently
careless
of
the
outcome
he
had
spent
his
time
in
reading
and
smoking
he
had
answered
questions
with
only
a
curt
yes
or
no
when
he
deigned
to
answer
them
at
all
and
there
had
been
no
callers
or
inquiries
for
him
he
had
abruptly
declined
a
suggestion
of
counsel
twice
each
day
morning
and
night
he
had
asked
a
question
of
the
jailer
who
brought
his
simple
meals
how
is
se√±or
alvarez
he
is
still
in
a
critical
condition
the
answer
was
always
the
same
whereupon
the
secret
agent
would
return
to
his
reading
with
not
a
shadow
of
uneasiness
or
concern
on
his
face
occasionally
there
came
a
courteous
little
note
from
miss
thorne
which
he
read
without
emotion
afterward
casting
them
aside
or
tearing
them
up
he
never
answered
them
and
then
one
day
there
came
another
note
which
for
no
apparent
reason
seemed
to
stir
him
from
his
lethargy
outwardly
it
was
like
all
the
others
but
when
signor
petrozinni
scanned
the
sheet
his
eyes
lighted
strangely
and
he
stood
staring
down
at
it
as
though
to
hide
a
sudden
change
of
expression
in
his
face
his
gaze
was
concentrated
on
two
small
splotches
of
ink
where
it
seemed
the
pen
had
scratched
as
miss
thorne
signed
her
name
the
guard
stood
at
the
barred
door
for
a
moment
then
started
to
turn
away
the
prisoner
stopped
him
with
a
quick
gesture
oh
guard
may
i
have
a
glass
of
milk
please
he
asked
no
ice
i
prefer
it
tepid
he
thrust
a
small
coin
between
the
bars
the
guard
accepted
it
and
passed
on
then
still
standing
at
the
door
the
prisoner
read
the
note
again
my
dear
friend
i
understand
from
an
indirect
source
that
there
has
been
a
marked
improvement
in
se√±or
alvarez
condition
and
i
am
hastening
to
send
you
the
good
news
there
is
every
hope
that
within
a
short
while
if
he
continues
to
improve
we
can
arrange
a
bail
bond
and
you
will
be
free
until
the
time
of
trial
anyway
might
it
not
be
well
for
you
to
consult
an
attorney
at
once
drop
me
a
line
to
let
me
know
you
received
this
sincerely
isabel
thorne
finally
the
prisoner
tossed
the
note
on
a
tiny
table
in
a
corner
of
his
cell
and
resumed
his
reading
after
a
time
the
guard
returned
with
the
milk
would
it
be
against
the
rules
for
me
to
write
an
answer
to
this
queried
signor
petrozinni
and
he
indicated
the
note
certainly
not
was
the
reply
if
i
might
trouble
you
then
for
pen
and
ink
and
paper
suggested
the
signor
and
he
smiled
a
little
believe
me
i
would
prefer
to
get
them
for
myself
i
guess
that
right
the
guard
grinned
again
he
went
away
and
the
prisoner
sat
thoughtfully
sipping
the
milk
he
took
half
of
it
then
lighted
a
cigarette
puffed
it
once
or
twice
and
permitted
the
light
to
die
after
a
little
there
came
again
the
clatter
of
the
guard
feet
on
the
cement
pavement
and
the
writing
materials
were
thrust
through
the
bars
thank
you
said
the
prisoner
the
guard
went
on
with
a
nod
and
a
moment
later
the
signor
heard
the
clangor
of
a
steel
door
down
the
corridor
as
it
was
closed
and
locked
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
with
eyes
listening
for
a
long
time
then
rose
and
noiselessly
approached
the
cell
door
again
he
listened
intently
after
which
he
resumed
his
seat
he
tossed
away
the
cigarette
he
had
and
lighted
a
fresh
one
afterward
holding
the
note
over
the
flame
of
the
match
here
and
there
where
the
paper
charred
in
the
heat
a
letter
or
word
stood
out
from
the
bare
whiteness
of
the
paper
and
finally
a
message
complete
appeared
between
the
innocuous
lines
the
prisoner
read
it
greedily
am
privately
informed
there
is
little
chance
of
alvarez
recovery
shall
i
arrange
escape
for
you
or
have
ambassador
intercede
would
advise
former
as
the
other
might
take
months
and
meeting
to
sign
treaty
alliance
would
be
dangerously
delayed
signor
petrozinni
permitted
the
sputtering
flame
to
ignite
the
paper
and
thoughtfully
watched
the
blaze
destroy
it
the
last
tiny
scrap
dropped
on
the
floor
burned
out
and
he
crushed
the
ashes
under
his
heel
then
he
began
to
write
my
dear
miss
thorne
many
thanks
for
your
courteous
little
note
i
am
delighted
to
know
of
the
improvement
in
se√±or
alvarez
condition
i
had
hoped
that
my
impulsive
act
in
shooting
him
would
not
end
in
a
tragedy
please
keep
me
informed
of
any
further
change
in
his
condition
as
yet
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
of
consulting
an
attorney
but
later
i
may
be
compelled
to
do
so
respectfully
pietro
petrozinni
this
done
the
secret
agent
carefully
cleaned
the
ink
from
the
pen
wiping
it
dry
with
his
handkerchief
then
thrust
it
into
the
half
empty
glass
of
milk
the
fluid
clung
to
the
steel
nib
thinly
he
went
on
writing
with
it
between
the
lines
of
ink
i
am
in
no
danger
i
hold
credentials
to
united
states
which
when
presented

arrangements
for
the
test
and
signing
of
compact
for
two
nights
after
again
the
prisoner
cleaned
the
steel
nib
after
which
he
put
it
back
in
the
bottle
of
ink
leaving
it
there
he
waved
the
sheet
of
paper
back
and
forth
to
dry
it
and
at
last
scrutinized
it
minutely
standing
under
the
light
from
the
window
of
his
cell
letter
by
letter
the
milk
evaporated
leaving
the
sheet
perfectly
clean
and
white
except
for
the
message
this
sheet
he
folded
placed
in
an
envelope
and
addressed
later
the
guard
passed
along
the
corridor
and
signor
petrozinni
thrust
the
letter
out
to
him
be
good
enough
to
post
that
please
he
requested
it
is
sealed

have
it
read
then
seal
it
for
answer
the
guard
dampened
the
flap
of
the
envelope
sealed
it
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
passed
on
the
secret
agent
sat
down
again
and
sipped
his
milk
meditatively
one
hour
later
grimm
accompanied
by
johnson
came
out
of
a
photographer
dark
room
in
pennsylvania
avenue
with
a
developed
negative
which
he
set
on
a
rack
to
dry
at
the
end
of
another
hour
he
was
sitting
at
his
desk
studying
under
a
magnifying
glass
a
finished
print
of
the
negative
word
by
word
he
was
writing
on
a
slip
of
paper
what
his
magnifying
glass
gave
him
and
so
curiously
enough
it
came
to
pass
that
miss
thorne
and
chief
campbell
of
the
secret
service
were
reading
the
hidden
message
at
almost
the
identical
moment
johnson
got
petrozinni
letter
from
the
postman
grimm
was
explaining
i
opened
it
photographed
it
sealed
it
again
and
remailed
it
there
was
not
more
than
half
an
hour
delay
and
miss
thorne
can
not
possibly
know
of
it
he
paused
a
moment
it
an
odd
thing
that
writing
such
as
that
is
absolutely
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
and
yet
when
photographed
becomes
decipherable
in
the
negative
what
do
you
make
of
it
campbell
asked
the
guileless
blue
eyes
were
alive
with
eagerness
well
he
right
of
course
about
not
being
in
danger
said
grimm
if
he
came
with
credentials
as
special
envoy
this
government
must
respect
them
even
if
se√±or
alvarez
dies
and
leave
it
to
his
own
government
to
punish
him
if
we
were
officially
aware
that
he
has
such
credentials
i
doubt
if
we
would
have
the
right
to
keep
him
confined
we
would
merely
have
to
hand
him
over
to
the
italian
embassy
and
demand
his
punishment
and
of
course
all
that
makes
him
more
dangerous
than
ever
yes
i
know
that
said
the
chief
a
little
impatiently
but
who
is
this
man
who
is
this
man
grimm
repeated
as
if
surprised
at
the
question
i
was
looking
for
prince
benedetto
of
italy
i
have
found
him
campbell
brain
ticked
over
the
situation
in
detail
it
like
this
grimm
elucidated
he
has
credentials
which
he
knows
will
free
him
if
he
is
forced
to
present
them
but
i
imagine
they
were
given
to
him
more
for
protection
in
an
emergency
like
this
than
for
introducing
him
to
our
government
as
the
matter
stands
he
ca
afford
to
discover
himself
by
using
those
credentials
and
yet
if
the
latin
compact
is
signed
he
must
be
free
remember
too
that
he
is
accredited
from
three
countries
italy
france
and
spain
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
naturally
his
escape
from
prison
would
preserve
his
incognito
and
at
the
same
time
permit
him
to
sign
the
compact
there
was
silence
for
a
long
time
i
believe
the
situation
is
without
precedent
said
campbell
slowly
the
special
envoy
of
three
great
powers
held
for
attempted
officially
we
are
not
aware
of
his
purpose
or
his
identity
grimm
reminded
him
if
he
escaped
it
would
clarify
the
situation
tremendously
if
he
escaped
repeated
campbell
musingly
but
of
course
the
compact
would
not
be
signed
at
least
in
this
country
grimm
went
on
tentatively
campbell
gazed
straight
into
the
listless
eyes
of
the
young
man
for
a
minute
or
more
and
gradually
full
understanding
came
home
to
him
finally
he
nodded
his
head
use
your
own
judgment
grimm
he
directed
xvii
a
call
on
the
warden
the
restful
silence
of
night
lay
over
the
great
prison
here
and
there
in
the
grim
corridors
a
guard
dozed
in
the
glare
of
an
electric
light
and
in
the
office
too
a
desk
light
glimmered
where
the
warden
sat
at
his
desk
poring
over
a
report
once
he
glanced
up
at
the
clock
it
was
five
minutes
of
eleven
and
then
he
went
on
with
his
reading
after
a
little
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
whir
of
the
clock
and
the
first
sharp
stroke
of
the
hour
and
at
just
that
moment
the
door
from
the
street
opened
and
a
man
entered
he
was
rather
tall
and
slender
and
a
sinister
black
mask
hid
his
face
from
the
quickly
raised
eyes
of
the
warden
for
a
bare
fraction
of
a
second
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
then
instinctively
the
warden
right
hand
moved
toward
the
open
drawer
of
his
desk
where
a
revolver
lay
and
his
left
toward
several
electrically
connected
levers
the
intruder
noted
both
gestures
and
unarmed
himself
stood
silent
the
warden
was
first
to
speak
well
what
is
it
you
have
a
prisoner
here
pietro
petrozinni
was
the
reply
in
a
pleasant
voice
i
have
come
to
demand
his
release
the
warden
right
hand
was
raised
above
the
desk
top
and
the
revolver
in
it
clicked
warningly
you
have
come
to
demand
his
release
eh
he
queried
he
still
sat
motionless
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
black
mask
how
did
you
pass
the
outside
guard
he
was
bribed
was
the
ready
response
now
warden
the
masked
intruder
continued
pacifically
it
would
be
much
more
pleasant
all
around
and
there
would
be
less
personal
danger
in
it
for
both
of
us
if
you
would
release
signor
petrozinni
without
question
i
may
add
that
no
bribe
was
offered
to
you
because
your
integrity
was
beyond
question
thank
you
said
the
warden
grimly
and
it
shall
remain
so
as
long
as
i
have
this
he
tapped
on
the
desk
with
the
revolver
oh
that
is
loaded
said
the
masked
man
quietly
one
quick
glance
at
the
weapon
showed
the
warden
that
the
cartridges
had
been
drawn
his
teeth
closed
with
a
snap
at
the
treachery
of
it
and
with
his
left
hand
he
pulled
back
one
of
the
levers
that
which
should
arouse
the
jailers
turnkeys
and
guards
instead
of
the
insistent
clangor
which
he
expected
there
was
silence
that
wire
has
been
cut
the
stranger
volunteered
with
clenched
teeth
the
warden
pulled
the
police
alarm
and
that
wire
was
cut
too
the
stranger
explained
the
warden
came
to
his
feet
with
white
face
and
nails
biting
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
he
still
held
the
revolver
as
he
advanced
upon
the
masked
man
threateningly
not
too
close
now
warned
the
intruder
with
a
sudden
hardening
of
his
voice
believe
me
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
release
this
man
because
it
must
be
done
pleasantly
or
otherwise
i
have
no
desire
to
injure
you
still
less
do
i
intend
that
you
shall
injure
me
and
it
would
be
needless
for
either
of
us
to
make
a
personal
matter
of
it
i
want
your
prisoner
signor
petrozinni
you
will
release
him
at
once
that
all
the
warden
paused
dazed
incredulous
before
the
audacity
of
it
while
he
studied
two
calm
eyes
which
peered
at
him
through
the
slits
of
the
mask
and
if
i
release
him
he
demanded
at
last
fiercely
then
i
shall
take
him
was
the
reply
it
has
been
made
impossible
for
you
to
give
an
alarm
the
stranger
went
on
the
very
men
on
whom
you
most
depended
have
been
bought
and
even
if
they
were
within
sound
of
your
voice
now
they
would
respond
one
of
your
assistants
who
has
been
here
for
years
unloaded
the
revolver
in
the
desk
there
and
less
than
an
hour
ago
cut
the
prison
alarm
wire
i
personally
cut
the
police
alarm
outside
the
building
so
you
see
as
yet
there
was
no
weapon
in
sight
save
the
unloaded
revolver
in
the
warden
hand
at
no
time
had
the
stranger
voice
been
raised
his
tone
was
a
perfectly
normal
one
besides
yourself
there
are
only
five
other
men
employed
here
who
are
now
awake
the
masked
man
continued
these
are
four
inner
guards
and
the
outer
guard
they
have
all
been
bought
the
turnkeys
at
five
thousand
dollars
each
and
the
outer
guard
at
seven
thousand
the
receipt
of
all
of
this
money
is
conditional
upon
the
release
of
signor
petrozinni
therefore
it
is
to
their
interest
to
aid
me
as
against
you
i
am
telling
you
all
this
frankly
and
fully
to
make
you
see
how
futile
any
resistance
would
be
but
who
who
is
this
signor
petrozinni
that
such
powerful
influences
should
be
brought
to
bear
in
his
behalf
demanded
the
bewildered
warden
he
is
a
man
who
can
command
a
vast
fortune
and
se√±or
alvarez
is
at
the
point
of
death
that
i
think
makes
it
clear
now
if
you
sit
down
please
sit
down
bellowed
the
warden
suddenly
he
was
seized
by
a
violent
maddening
rage
he
took
one
step
forward
and
raised
the
empty
revolver
to
strike
the
masked
man
moved
slightly
to
one
side
and
his
clenched
fist
caught
the
warden
on
the
point
of
the
chin
the
official
went
down
without
a
sound
and
lay
still
inert
a
moment
later
the
door
leading
into
the
corridor
of
the
prison
opened
and
signor
petrozinni
accompanied
by
one
of
the
guards
entered
the
warden
office
the
masked
man
glanced
around
at
them
and
with
a
motion
of
his
head
indicated
the
door
leading
to
the
street
they
passed
through
closing
the
door
behind
them
for
a
little
time
the
intruder
stood
staring
down
at
the
still
body
then
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
police
headquarters
there
has
been
a
jail
delivery
at
the
prison
he
said
in
answer
to
the
hello
of
the
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
better
send
some
of
your
men
up
to
investigate
who
is
that
came
the
answering
question
the
stranger
replaced
the
receiver
on
the
hook
stripped
off
his
black
mask
dropped
it
on
the
floor
beside
the
motionless
warden
and
went
out
it
was
grimm
xviii
notice
to
leave
at
fifteen
minutes
of
midnight
when
miss
thorne
followed
by
signor
petrozinni
entered
the
of
her
apartments
in
the
hotel
and
turned
up
the
light
they
found
grimm
already
there
he
rose
courteously
at
sight
of
him
miss
thorne
face
went
deathly
white
and
the
escaped
prisoner
turned
toward
the
door
again
i
would
advise
that
you
stay
your
highness
said
grimm
coldly
signor
petrozinni
paused
amazed
you
will
merely
subject
yourself
to
the
humiliation
of
arrest
if
you
attempt
to
leave
the
house
is
guarded
by
a
dozen
men
your
highness
miss
thorne
repeated
blankly
you
are
assuming
a
great
deal
are
you
mr
grimm
i
do
believe
and
grimm
listless
eyes
were
fixed
on
those
of
the
escaped
prisoner
i
do
believe
that
prince
benedetto
will
deny
his
identity
there
was
one
of
those
long
tense
silences
when
eye
challenges
eye
when
wit
is
pitted
against
wit
and
mind
is
hauled
around
to
a
new
and
sometimes
unattractive
view
of
a
situation
miss
thorne
stood
silent
with
rigid
features
colorless
as
marble
but
slowly
a
sneer
settled
about
the
lips
of
signor
petrozinni
that
was
and
he
sat
down
illustration
a
long
tense
silence
when
eye
challenges
eye
you
seem
to
know
everything
grimm
he
taunted
i
to
know
everything
your
highness
was
the
reply
grimm
was
still
standing
i
know
for
instance
that
one
week
ago
the
plot
which
had
your
freedom
for
its
purpose
was
born
i
know
the
contents
of
every
letter
that
passed
between
you
and
miss
thorne
here
notwithstanding
the
invisible
ink
i
know
that
four
days
ago
several
thousand
dollars
was
smuggled
in
to
you
concealed
in
a
basket
of
fruit
i
know
with
that
money
you
bribed
your
way
out
while
miss
thorne
or
one
of
her
agents
bribed
the
guard
in
front
i
know
that
the
escape
was
planned
for
and
that
the
man
who
was
delegated
to
take
charge
of
it
is
now
locked
in
my
office
under
guard
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
it
was
i
who
took
his
place
and
made
the
escape
possible
i
know
that
much
you
the
prince
burst
out
suddenly
aided
me
to
escape
miss
thorne
was
staring
staring
at
them
with
her
eyes
widely
distended
and
her
red
lips
slightly
parted
did
you
assist
him
she
demanded
details
are
tiresome
miss
thorne
replied
grimm
with
the
utmost
courtesy
there
is
one
other
thing
i
know
that
the
latin
compact
will
not
be
signed
in
the
united
states
the
prince
eyes
met
miss
thorne
inquiringly
and
she
shook
her
head
the
sneer
was
still
playing
about
his
mouth
anything
else
of
special
interest
that
you
know
he
queried
yes
of
interest
to
both
you
and
miss
thorne
that
is
merely
if
the
latin
compact
is
signed
anywhere
the
countries
of
the
world
might
construe
it
as
a
and
strike
soon
enough
and
hard
enough
to
put
an
end
to
it
once
for
all
again
there
was
silence
for
a
little
while
slowly
the
prince
eyes
were
darkening
and
a
shadow
flitted
across
miss
thorne
face
the
prince
rose
impatiently
well
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
are
you
going
to
take
me
back
to
prison
no
said
grimm
he
glanced
at
his
watch
i
will
give
each
of
you
hour
to
pack
your
belongings
we
must
catch
a
train
at
one
leave
the
city
gasped
miss
thorne
impossible
exclaimed
the
prince
hour
said
grimm
coldly
but
but
it
out
of
the
question
expostulated
miss
thorne
hour
repeated
grimm
he
did
dare
to
meet
those
wonderful
eyes
now
a
special
car
with
private
compartments
will
be
attached
to
the
regular
train
and
the
only
inconvenience
to
you
will
be
the
fact
that
the
three
of
us
will
be
compelled
to
sit
up
all
night
half
a
dozen
other
secret
service
men
will
be
on
the
train
with
us
and
then
the
prince
entire
manner
underwent
a
change
grimm
he
said
earnestly
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
remain
in
washington
for
another
week
remain
here
even
if
i
am
locked
up
again
lock
me
up
again
if
you
like
i
ca
sign
compacts
in
prison
minutes
replied
grimm
quietly
but
here
exclaimed
the
prince
explosively
i
have
credentials
which
will
insure
my
protection
in
spite
of
your
laws
i
know
that
said
grimm
placidly
credentials
of
that
nature
can
not
be
presented
at
midnight
and
you
will
not
be
here
to
present
them
the
fact
that
you
have
those
credentials
your
highness
is
one
reason
why
you
must
leave
washington
now
xix
by
wireless
they
paused
in
the
office
the
three
of
them
and
while
miss
thorne
was
giving
some
instructions
as
to
her
baggage
the
prince
went
over
to
the
telegraph
booth
and
began
to
write
a
message
on
a
blank
grimm
appeared
at
his
elbow
no
he
said
ca
i
send
a
telegram
if
i
like
demanded
the
prince
sharply
no
nor
a
note
nor
a
letter
nor
may
you
speak
to
any
one
grimm
informed
him
quietly
why
it
an
outrage
flamed
the
prince
it
depends
altogether
on
the
your
highness
said
grimm
courteously
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
might
suggest
that
it
is
needless
to
attract
attention
by
your
present
attitude
you
may
i
say
you
compel
me
to
humiliate
you
the
prince
glared
at
him
angrily
i
mean
handcuff
you
grimm
added
gratuitously
handcuff
i
should
hesitate
your
highness
if
it
was
necessary
after
a
moment
miss
thorne
signified
her
readiness
and
they
started
out
at
the
door
grimm
stopped
and
turned
back
to
the
desk
as
if
struck
by
some
sudden
thought
leaving
them
together
oh
miss
thorne
left
a
message
for
some
one
grimm
was
saying
to
the
clerk
she
decided
it
is
unnecessary
he
turned
and
glanced
toward
her
and
the
clerk
eyes
followed
his
please
give
it
to
me
it
was
passed
over
without
comment
it
was
a
sealed
envelope
addressed
to
charles
winthrop
rankin
grimm
glanced
at
the
superscription
tore
the
envelope
into
bits
and
dropped
it
into
a
basket
a
minute
later
he
was
assisting
miss
thorne
and
the
prince
into
an
automobile
that
was
waiting
in
front
as
the
car
moved
away
two
other
automobiles
appeared
from
corners
and
trailed
along
behind
to
the
station
there
a
private
was
in
readiness
for
them
it
was
a
long
dreary
ride
a
ride
of
utter
silence
save
for
the
roar
and
clatter
of
the
moving
train
grimm
vigilant
implacable
sat
at
ease
miss
thorne
resigned
to
the
inevitable
whatever
it
might
be
studied
the
calm
quiet
face
from
beneath
drooping
lids
and
the
prince
sullen
scowling
nervously
wriggled
in
his
seat
philadelphia
was
passed
and
trenton
and
then
the
dawn
began
to
break
through
the
night
it
was
quite
light
when
they
rolled
into
jersey
city
i
sorry
for
all
the
inconvenience
i
have
caused
grimm
apologized
to
miss
thorne
as
he
assisted
her
to
alight
you
must
be
exhausted
if
it
were
only
that
she
replied
with
a
slight
smile
and
is
it
too
early
to
ask
where
we
are
going
the
prince
turned
quickly
at
the
question
we
take
the
for
liverpool
at
ten
said
grimm
obligingly
meanwhile
let
get
some
coffee
and
a
bite
to
eat
are
you
going
to
make
the
trip
with
us
asked
the
prince
grimm
shrugged
his
shoulders
weary
and
spiritless
they
went
aboard
the
boat
and
a
little
while
later
they
steamed
out
into
the
stream
and
threaded
their
way
down
the
bay
miss
thorne
stood
at
the
rail
gazing
back
upon
the
city
they
were
leaving
grimm
stood
beside
her
the
prince
still
sullen
still
scowling
sat
a
dozen
feet
away
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
you
have
done
grimm
said
miss
thorne
at
last
thank
you
he
said
simply
it
was
a
destructive
thing
that
you
intended
to
do
did
you
ever
see
a
more
marvelous
thing
than
that
and
he
indicated
the
of
new
york
it
the
most
marvelous
bit
of
mechanism
in
the
world
the
dynamo
of
the
western
hemisphere
you
would
have
destroyed
it
because
in
the
that
would
have
been
the
first
point
of
attack
she
raised
her
eyebrows
but
was
silent
somehow
he
went
on
after
a
moment
i
could
never
associate
a
woman
with
destructiveness
with
wars
and
with
violence
that
is
an
unjust
way
of
saying
it
she
interposed
and
then
musingly
is
it
odd
that
you
and
i
standing
here
by
the
rail
have
in
a
way
held
the
destinies
of
the
whole
great
earth
in
our
hands
and
now
your
remark
makes
me
feel
that
you
alone
have
stood
for
peace
and
the
general
good
and
i
for
destruction
and
evil
i
did
mean
that
grimm
said
quickly
you
have
done
your
duty
as
you
saw
it
and
failed
she
interrupted
and
i
have
done
my
duty
as
i
saw
it
and
won
she
added
she
smiled
a
little
sadly
i
think
perhaps
you
and
i
might
have
been
excellent
friends
if
it
had
not
been
for
all
this
i
know
we
should
have
said
grimm
almost
eagerly
i
wonder
if
you
will
ever
forgive
me
for
for
forgive
you
she
repeated
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
one
must
do
one
duty
but
i
wish
it
could
have
been
otherwise
the
statue
of
liberty
slid
by
and
governor
island
and
fort
hamilton
then
in
the
distance
sandy
hook
light
came
into
view
i
going
to
leave
you
here
said
grimm
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
tense
strained
note
in
his
voice
miss
thorne
eyes
had
grown
mistily
thoughtful
the
words
startled
her
a
little
and
she
turned
to
face
him
it
may
be
that
you
and
i
shall
never
meet
again
grimm
went
on
we
meet
again
she
said
gravely
when
and
where
i
do
know
but
it
will
come
and
perhaps
then
we
may
be
friends
he
was
pleading
now
why
we
are
friends
now
are
we
she
asked
and
again
the
smile
curled
her
scarlet
lips
surely
we
are
friends
are
we
we
are
he
declared
positively
as
they
started
forward
a
revenue
cutter
which
had
been
hovering
about
sandy
hook
put
toward
them
flying
some
signal
at
her
masthead
slowly
the
great
boat
on
which
they
stood
crept
along
then
the
clang
of
a
bell
in
the
brought
her
to
a
standstill
and
the
revenue
cutter
came
alongside
i
leave
you
here
grimm
said
again
it
she
said
softly
till
we
meet
once
more
she
extended
both
hands
impulsively
and
he
stood
for
an
instant
staring
into
the
limpid
gray
eyes
then
turning
went
below
from
the
revenue
cutter
he
waved
a
hand
at
her
as
the
great
moving
again
sped
on
her
way
the
prince
joined
miss
thorne
at
the
rail
the
scowl
was
still
on
his
face
and
now
what
he
demanded
abruptly
this
man
has
treated
us
as
if
we
were
a
pair
of
children
he
a
wonderful
man
she
replied
that
may
be
but
we
have
been
fools
to
allow
him
to
do
all
this
miss
thorne
turned
flatly
and
faced
him
we
are
not
beaten
yet
she
said
slowly
if
all
things
go
well
we
we
are
not
beaten
yet
the
was
rounding
montauk
point
when
the
wireless
brought
her
to
with
a
curt
message
isabel
thorne
and
pietro
petrozinni
aboard
wanted
on
warrants
charging
conspiracy
will
take
them
off
intercepting
you
beyond
montauk
point
campbell
secret
service
what
does
mean
asked
the
prince
bewildered
it
means
that
the
compact
will
be
signed
in
washington
in
spite
of
grimm
and
there
was
the
glitter
of
triumph
in
her
eyes
with
the
aid
of
one
of
the
maids
in
the
depot
at
jersey
city
i
managed
to
get
a
telegram
of
explanation
and
instruction
to
de
foe
in
new
york
and
this
is
the
result
he
signed
campbell
name
i
suppose
to
give
weight
to
the
message
an
hour
later
a
came
alongside
and
they
went
aboard
xx
the
light
in
the
dome
from
where
he
sat
in
a
tiny
alcove
which
jutted
out
and
encroached
upon
the
line
of
the
sidewalk
grimm
looked
down
on
pennsylvania
avenue
the
central
thread
of
washington
ever
changing
always
brilliant
splashed
at
regular
intervals
with
light
from
electric
arcs
the
early
theater
crowd
was
in
the
street
well
dressed
well
fed
careless
for
the
moment
of
all
things
save
physical
comfort
and
amusement
automobiles
carriages
cabs
cars
flowed
past
endlessly
and
yet
grimm
saw
naught
of
it
in
the
distance
at
one
end
of
the
avenue
the
dome
of
the
capitol
cleft
the
shadows
of
night
and
a
single
light
sparkled
at
its
apex
in
the
other
direction
at
the
left
of
the
treasury
building
which
abruptly
blocks
the
wide
thoroughfare
were
the
shimmering
windows
of
the
white
house
motionless
moody
thoughtful
grimm
sat
staring
staring
straight
ahead
comprehending
none
of
these
things
which
lay
before
him
as
in
a
panorama
instead
his
memory
was
conjuring
up
a
pair
of
subtle
eyes
now
pleading
now
coquettish
now
frankly
defiant
two
slim
white
wonderful
hands
the
echo
of
a
pleasant
throaty
laugh
a
splendid
elusive
phantom
truly
a
woman
of
mystery
who
was
this
isabel
thorne
who
for
months
past
had
been
the
and
directing
mind
of
a
vast
international
intrigue
which
threatened
the
world
with
war
who
this
remarkable
young
woman
who
with
ease
and
assurance
commanded
ambassadors
and
played
nations
as
pawns
now
that
she
was
safely
out
of
the
country
grimm
had
leisure
to
speculate
upon
him
had
devolved
the
duty
of
blocking
her
plans
and
he
had
done
so
merciless
alike
of
his
own
feeling
and
of
hers
hesitation
or
evasion
had
never
occurred
to
him
it
was
a
thing
to
be
done
and
he
did
it
he
wondered
if
she
had
understood
there
at
the
last
beside
the
rail
he
wondered
if
she
knew
the
struggle
it
had
cost
him
deliberately
to
send
her
out
of
his
life
or
had
even
surmised
that
her
expulsion
from
the
country
by
his
direct
act
was
wholly
lacking
in
the
exaltation
of
triumph
to
him
that
it
struck
deeper
than
that
below
the
listless
official
exterior
into
his
personal
happiness
and
wondering
he
knew
that
she
understand
a
silent
shod
waiter
came
and
placed
the
coffee
things
at
his
elbow
he
did
heed
the
waiter
poured
a
and
inquiringly
lifted
a
lump
of
sugar
in
the
silver
tongs
still
grimm
did
heed
at
last
the
waiter
deposited
the
sugar
on
the
edge
of
the
fragile
saucer
and
moved
away
as
silently
as
he
had
come
a
newspaper
which
grimm
had
placed
on
the
end
of
the
table
when
he
sat
down
rattled
a
little
as
a
breeze
from
the
open
window
caught
it
then
the
top
sheet
slid
off
and
fell
to
the
floor
grimm
was
still
staring
out
the
window
slowly
the
room
behind
him
was
thinning
of
its
crowd
as
the
diners
went
out
in
twos
and
threes
the
last
of
these
disappeared
finally
and
save
for
grimm
there
were
not
more
than
a
dozen
persons
left
in
the
place
thus
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
the
swinging
doors
leading
from
the
street
clicked
and
a
gentleman
entered
he
glanced
around
as
if
seeking
a
seat
near
a
window
then
moved
along
in
grimm
direction
between
the
rows
of
tables
his
gaze
lingered
on
grimm
for
an
instant
and
when
he
came
opposite
he
stooped
and
picked
up
the
fallen
newspaper
sheet
your
paper
he
inquired
courteously
grimm
was
still
gazing
dreamily
out
of
the
window
i
beg
pardon
insisted
the
pleasantly
he
folded
the
paper
once
and
replaced
it
on
the
table
one
hand
lingered
for
just
the
fraction
of
a
moment
above
grimm
aroused
by
the
remark
grimm
glanced
around
oh
thank
you
he
apologized
hastily
i
did
hear
you
at
first
thank
you
the
nodded
smiled
and
passed
on
taking
a
seat
two
or
three
tables
down
apparently
this
trifling
courtesy
had
broken
the
spell
of
reverie
for
grimm
squared
around
to
the
table
again
drew
his
toward
him
and
dropped
in
the
single
lump
of
sugar
he
idly
stirred
it
for
a
moment
as
his
eyes
turned
again
toward
the
open
window
then
he
lifted
the
tiny
cup
and
emptied
it
again
he
sat
motionless
for
a
long
time
and
thrice
the
only
a
few
feet
away
glanced
at
him
narrowly
and
now
it
seemed
a
peculiar
drowsiness
was
overtaking
grimm
once
he
caught
himself
nodding
and
raised
his
head
with
a
jerk
then
he
noticed
that
the
arc
lights
in
the
street
were
wobbling
curiously
and
he
fell
to
wondering
why
that
single
flame
sparkled
at
the
apex
of
the
capitol
dome
things
around
him
grew
hazy
vague
unreal
and
then
as
if
realizing
that
something
was
the
matter
with
him
he
came
to
his
feet
he
took
one
step
forward
into
the
space
between
the
tables
reeled
attempted
to
steady
himself
by
holding
on
to
a
chair
then
everything
grew
black
about
him
and
he
pitched
forward
on
the
floor
his
face
was
dead
white
his
fingers
moved
a
little
nervously
weakly
then
they
were
still
several
people
rose
at
the
sound
of
the
falling
body
and
the
hurried
forward
his
coat
sleeve
caught
the
empty
as
he
stooped
and
swept
it
to
the
floor
where
it
was
shattered
the
head
waiter
and
another
came
and
those
diners
who
had
risen
came
more
slowly
what
the
matter
asked
the
head
waiter
anxiously
already
the
was
supporting
grimm
on
his
knee
and
flicking
water
in
his
face
nothing
serious
i
fancy
he
answered
shortly
he
subject
to
these
little
attacks
what
are
they
who
is
he
the
stranger
tore
at
grimm
collar
until
it
came
loose
then
he
fell
to
chafing
the
still
hands
he
is
a
grimm
a
government
employee
i
know
him
he
answered
again
i
imagine
it
nothing
more
serious
than
indigestion
a
little
knot
had
gathered
about
them
with
offers
of
assistance
waiter
had
you
better
send
for
a
physician
some
one
suggested
i
a
physician
the
stranger
put
in
impatiently
have
some
one
call
a
cab
and
i
see
that
he
taken
home
it
happens
that
we
live
in
the
same
apartment
house
just
a
few
blocks
from
here
obedient
to
the
directions
a
cab
was
called
and
five
minutes
later
grimm
still
insensible
was
lifted
into
it
the
stranger
took
a
seat
beside
him
the
cabby
touched
his
horse
with
a
whip
and
the
vehicle
fell
into
the
endless
moving
line
xxi
a
slip
of
paper
when
the
light
of
returning
consciousness
finally
pierced
the
black
lethargy
that
enshrouded
him
grimm
mind
was
a
chaos
of
vagrant
absurd
fantasies
then
slowly
slowly
realization
struggled
back
to
its
own
and
he
came
to
know
things
first
was
the
knowledge
that
he
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
on
a
couch
it
seemed
then
that
he
was
in
the
dark
an
utter
abject
darkness
and
finally
came
an
overwhelming
sense
of
silence
for
a
while
he
lay
motionless
with
not
even
the
movement
of
an
to
indicate
consciousness
wrapped
in
a
delicious
languor
gradually
this
passed
and
the
feeble
flutter
of
his
heart
grew
into
a
steady
rhythmic
beat
the
keen
brain
was
awakening
he
was
beginning
to
remember
what
had
happened
he
knew
only
that
in
some
manner
a
drug
had
been
administered
to
him
a
bitter
dose
tasting
of
opium
that
speechlessly
he
had
fought
against
it
that
he
had
risen
from
the
table
in
the
restaurant
and
that
he
had
fallen
all
the
rest
was
blank
with
eyes
still
closed
and
nerveless
hands
inert
at
his
sides
he
listened
the
while
he
turned
the
situation
over
in
speculative
mood
the
waiter
had
administered
the
drug
of
course
unless
unless
it
had
been
the
courteous
stranger
who
had
replaced
the
newspaper
on
the
table
that
thought
opened
new
fields
of
conjecture
grimm
had
no
recollection
of
ever
having
seen
him
before
and
he
had
paid
only
the
enforced
attention
of
politeness
to
him
and
why
had
the
drug
been
administered
vaguely
incoherently
grimm
imagined
that
in
some
way
it
had
to
do
with
the
great
international
plot
of
war
in
which
miss
thorne
was
so
delicate
and
vital
an
instrument
where
was
he
conjecture
stopped
there
evidently
he
was
where
the
courteous
gentleman
in
the
restaurant
wanted
him
to
be
a
prisoner
probably
in
danger
long
careful
attention
to
detail
work
in
the
secret
service
had
convinced
grimm
that
he
was
always
in
danger
that
was
one
reason
and
the
best
why
he
had
lain
motionless
without
so
much
as
lifting
a
finger
since
that
first
glimmer
of
consciousness
had
entered
his
brain
he
was
probably
under
scrutiny
even
in
the
darkness
and
for
the
present
it
was
desirable
to
accommodate
any
chance
watcher
by
remaining
apparently
unconscious
and
so
for
a
long
time
he
lay
listening
was
there
another
person
in
the
room
grimm
ears
were
keenly
alive
for
the
inadvertent
shuffling
of
a
foot
or
the
sound
of
breathing
nothing
even
the
night
roar
of
the
city
was
missing
the
silence
was
oppressive
at
last
he
opened
his
eyes
a
pall
of
gloom
encompassed
him
a
pall
without
one
rift
of
light
his
fingers
moving
slowly
explored
the
limits
of
the
couch
whereon
he
lay
confident
at
last
that
wherever
he
was
he
was
unwatched
grimm
was
on
the
point
of
concluding
that
further
inaction
was
useless
when
his
straining
ears
caught
the
faint
grating
of
metal
against
metal
perhaps
the
insertion
of
a
key
in
the
lock
his
hands
grew
still
his
eyes
closed
and
after
a
moment
a
door
creaked
slightly
on
its
hinges
and
a
breath
of
cool
air
informed
grimm
that
that
open
door
wherever
it
was
led
to
the
outside
and
freedom
there
was
another
faint
creaking
as
the
door
was
shut
nerveless
hands
closed
involuntarily
and
his
lips
were
set
together
tightly
was
it
to
be
a
knife
thrust
in
the
dark
if
not
then
what
he
expected
the
flare
of
a
match
instead
there
was
a
soft
tread
and
the
rustle
of
skirts
a
woman
grimm
caution
was
all
but
forgotten
in
his
surprise
as
the
steps
drew
nearer
his
clenched
fingers
loosened
he
waited
two
hands
stretched
forward
in
the
dark
touched
him
simultaneously
one
on
the
face
one
on
the
breast
a
singular
thrill
shot
through
him
but
there
was
not
the
flicker
of
an
eye
or
the
twitching
of
a
finger
the
woman
it
a
woman
seemed
now
to
be
bending
over
him
then
he
heard
her
drop
on
her
knees
beside
him
and
she
pressed
an
inquiring
ear
to
his
left
side
it
was
the
heart
test
thank
god
she
breathed
softly
it
was
only
by
a
masterful
effort
that
grimm
held
himself
limp
and
inert
for
a
strange
fragrance
was
enveloping
him
a
fragrance
he
well
knew
the
hands
were
fumbling
at
his
breast
again
and
there
was
the
sharp
crackle
of
paper
at
first
he
did
understand
then
he
knew
that
the
woman
had
pinned
a
paper
to
the
lapel
of
his
coat
finally
she
straightened
up
and
took
two
steps
away
from
him
after
which
came
a
pause
his
keenly
attuned
ears
caught
her
faint
breathing
then
the
rustle
of
her
skirts
as
she
turned
back
she
was
leaning
over
him
again
her
lips
touched
his
forehead
barely
again
there
was
a
quick
rustling
of
skirts
the
door
creaked
and
silence
deep
oppressive
overwhelming
silence
isabel
was
he
dreaming
and
then
he
ceased
wondering
and
fell
to
remembering
her
kiss
light
as
air
and
the
softly
spoken
thank
god
she
did
care
then
she
understood
that
day
the
kiss
of
a
woman
beloved
is
a
splendid
heart
tonic
grimm
straightened
up
suddenly
on
the
couch
himself
again
he
touched
the
slip
of
paper
which
she
had
pinned
to
his
coat
to
make
sure
it
was
not
all
a
dream
after
which
he
recalled
the
fact
that
while
he
had
heard
the
door
creak
before
she
went
out
he
had
not
heard
it
creak
afterward
therefore
the
door
was
open
she
had
left
it
open
purposely
that
was
beside
the
question
at
the
moment
and
why
how
was
she
in
washington
pondering
that
question
grimm
excellent
teeth
clicked
sharply
together
and
he
rose
he
knew
the
answer
the
compact
was
to
be
signed
the
alliance
which
would
array
the
civilized
world
in
arms
he
had
failed
to
block
that
as
he
thought
if
miss
thorne
had
returned
then
prince
benedetto
who
held
absolute
power
to
sign
the
compact
for
italy
france
and
spain
had
also
returned
stealthily
feeling
his
way
as
he
went
grimm
moved
toward
the
door
leading
to
freedom
guided
by
the
fresh
draft
of
air
he
reached
the
door
it
was
standing
open
and
a
moment
later
stepped
out
into
the
night
it
was
open
country
here
with
a
thread
of
white
road
just
ahead
and
farther
along
a
fringe
of
shrubbery
grimm
reached
the
road
far
down
it
a
pin
point
in
the
night
a
light
flickered
through
interlacing
branches
the
tail
lamp
of
an
automobile
of
course
grimm
left
the
road
and
skirted
a
sparse
hedge
in
the
direction
of
the
light
after
a
moment
he
heard
the
engine
of
an
automobile
and
saw
a
woman
barely
discernible
step
into
the
car
as
it
started
forward
he
staked
everything
on
one
bold
move
and
won
his
reward
being
a
narrow
sitting
space
in
the
rear
of
the
car
hidden
from
its
occupants
by
the
tonneau
one
mile
two
miles
three
miles
they
charged
through
the
night
and
still
he
clung
on
at
last
there
came
relief
that
the
place
where
the
lights
are
just
ahead
there
was
no
mistaking
that
voice
raised
above
the
clamor
of
the
engine
the
car
slackened
speed
and
grimm
dropped
off
and
darted
behind
some
convenient
bushes
and
the
first
thing
he
did
there
was
to
light
a
match
and
read
what
was
written
on
the
slip
of
paper
pinned
to
his
coat
it
was
simply
my
dear
grimm
by
the
time
you
read
this
the
compact
will
have
been
signed
and
your
efforts
to
prevent
it
splendid
as
they
were
futile
it
is
a
tribute
to
you
that
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
you
must
be
accounted
for
at
the
time
of
the
signing
hence
the
drugging
in
the
restaurant
it
was
only
an
act
of
kindness
that
i
should
come
here
to
see
that
all
was
well
with
you
and
leave
the
door
open
behind
me
believe
me
when
i
say
that
you
are
one
man
in
whom
i
have
never
been
disappointed
accept
this
as
my
farewell
for
now
i
assume
again
the
name
and
position
rightfully
mine
and
know
too
that
i
shall
always
cherish
the
belief
that
you
will
remember
me
as
your
friend
isabel
thorne
the
prince
and
i
left
the
steamer
at
montauk
point
on
a
grimm
kissed
the
note
twice
then
burned
it
xxii
the
compact
a
room
dim
gloomy
sinister
as
an
inquisition
chamber
a
single
large
table
in
the
center
holding
a
kerosene
lamp
writing
materials
and
a
metal
spheroid
a
shade
larger
than
a
shell
and
around
it
a
semicircle
of
silent
masked
and
cowled
figures
there
were
twelve
of
them
eleven
men
and
a
woman
in
the
shadows
which
grew
denser
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
squat
globular
object
a
massive
black
threatening
thing
of
iron
one
of
the
men
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
just
two
then
rose
and
took
a
position
beside
the
table
facing
the
semicircle
he
placed
the
timepiece
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
gentlemen
he
said
and
there
was
the
faintest
trace
of
a
foreign
accent
i
shall
speak
english
because
i
know
that
whatever
your
nationality
all
of
you
are
familiar
with
that
tongue
and
now
an
apology
for
the
theatric
aspect
of
all
this
the
masks
the
time
and
place
of
meeting
and
the
rest
of
it
he
paused
a
moment
there
is
only
one
person
living
who
knows
the
name
and
position
of
all
of
you
and
by
a
sweep
of
his
hand
he
indicated
the
motionless
figure
of
the
woman
it
was
by
her
decision
that
masks
are
worn
for
while
we
all
know
the
details
of
the
latin
compact
there
is
a
bare
chance
that
some
one
will
not
sign
and
it
is
not
desirable
that
the
identity
of
that
person
be
known
to
all
of
us
the
reason
for
the
selection
of
this
time
and
place
is
obvious
for
an
inkling
of
the
proposed
signing
has
reached
the
secret
service
i
will
add
the
united
states
was
chosen
as
the
birthplace
of
this
new
epoch
in
history
for
several
reasons
one
being
the
proximity
to
central
and
south
america
and
another
the
inadequate
police
system
which
enables
greater
freedom
of
action
he
stopped
and
drew
from
his
pocket
a
folded
parchment
he
tapped
the
tips
of
his
fingers
with
it
from
time
to
time
as
he
talked
the
latin
compact
gentlemen
is
not
the
dream
of
a
night
nor
of
a
decade
as
long
as
fifty
years
ago
it
was
suggested
and
whatever
differences
the
latin
countries
of
the
world
have
had
among
themselves
they
have
always
realized
that
ultimately
they
must
stand
together
against
against
the
other
nations
of
the
world
this
idea
germinated
into
action
three
years
ago
and
since
that
time
agents
have
covered
the
world
in
its
interest
this
meeting
is
the
fruition
of
all
that
work
and
this
he
held
the
parchment
aloft
is
the
instrument
that
will
unite
us
never
has
a
diplomatic
secret
been
kept
as
this
has
been
kept
never
has
a
greater
reprisal
been
planned
it
means
gentlemen
the
domination
of
the
world
socially
spiritually
commercially
and
artistically
it
means
that
england
and
the
united
states
whose
sphere
of
influence
has
extended
around
the
globe
will
be
beaten
back
that
the
flag
of
the
latin
countries
will
wave
again
over
lost
possessions
it
means
all
of
that
and
more
his
voice
had
risen
as
he
talked
until
it
had
grown
vibrant
with
enthusiasm
and
his
hands
pointed
his
remarks
with
quick
sharp
gestures
all
this
he
went
on
was
never
possible
until
three
years
ago
when
the
navies
of
the
world
were
given
over
into
the
hands
of
one
nation
my
country
five
years
ago
a
of
mine
happened
to
be
present
at
an
electrical
exhibition
in
new
york
city
and
there
he
witnessed
an
interesting
experiment
practical
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
a
submarine
mine
may
be
exploded
by
the
use
of
the
marconi
wireless
system
he
was
a
practical
electrician
himself
and
the
idea
lingered
in
his
mind
for
two
years
he
experimented
and
finally
this
resulted
he
picked
up
the
metal
spheroid
and
held
it
out
for
their
inspection
as
it
stands
it
is
absolutely
perfect
and
gives
a
world
supremacy
to
the
latin
countries
because
it
places
all
the
navies
of
the
world
at
our
mercy
it
is
a
variation
of
the
percussion
cap
or
fuse
by
which
mines
and
torpedoes
are
exploded
the
theory
of
it
is
simple
as
are
the
theories
of
all
great
inventions
the
secret
of
its
construction
is
known
only
to
its
inventor
a
man
of
whom
you
never
heard
it
is
merely
that
the
mechanism
of
the
cap
is
so
delicate
that
the
marconi
wireless
waves
and
those
will
fire
the
cap
in
other
words
this
cap
is
tuned
if
i
may
use
the
word
to
a
certain
number
of
vibrations
and
a
wireless
instrument
of
high
power
with
a
modifying
addition
which
the
inventor
has
added
has
only
to
be
set
in
motion
to
discharge
it
at
any
distance
up
to
miles
high
power
wireless
waves
recognize
no
obstacle
so
the
explosion
of
a
submarine
mine
is
as
easily
brought
about
as
would
be
the
explosion
of
a
mine
on
dry
land
you
will
readily
see
its
value
as
a
protective
agency
for
our
seaports
he
replaced
the
spheroid
on
the
table
but
its
chief
value
is
not
in
that
he
resumed
its
chief
value
to
the
latin
compact
gentlemen
is
that
the
united
states
and
england
are
now
concluding
negotiations
unknown
to
each
other
by
which
will
protect
seaports
by
means
of
mines
primed
with
this
cap
the
tuning
of
the
caps
which
we
will
use
is
known
only
to
us
tuning
of
the
caps
which
they
will
use
is
also
known
to
the
addition
to
the
wireless
apparatus
which
they
will
use
is
such
that
they
even
by
accident
explode
a
mine
guarding
our
seaports
but
on
the
other
hand
the
addition
to
the
wireless
apparatus
which
will
use
permits
of
the
extreme
high
charge
which
will
explode
their
mines
to
make
it
clearer
we
could
send
a
navy
against
such
a
city
as
new
york
or
liverpool
and
explode
every
mine
in
front
of
us
as
we
went
and
meanwhile
our
mines
are
impervious
another
word
and
i
have
finished
five
gentlemen
whom
i
imagine
are
present
now
have
witnessed
a
test
of
this
cap
by
direct
command
of
their
home
governments
for
the
benefit
of
the
others
of
you
a
simple
test
has
been
arranged
for
this
cap
on
the
table
is
charged
its
inventor
is
at
his
wireless
instrument
fifteen
miles
away
at
three
he
will
turn
on
the
current
that
will
explode
it
four
of
the
eleven
men
looked
at
their
watches
it
is
now
seventeen
minutes
past
two
i
am
instructed
for
the
purposes
of
the
test
to
place
this
cap
anywhere
you
may
select
in
this
house
or
outside
of
it
in
a
box
sealed
or
under
water
the
purpose
is
merely
to
demonstrate
its
efficacy
to
prove
to
your
complete
satisfaction
that
it
can
be
exploded
under
practically
any
conditions
his
entire
manner
underwent
a
change
he
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
table
and
stood
for
an
instant
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
back
the
compact
is
written
in
three
languages
english
french
and
italian
i
shall
ask
you
to
sign
after
reading
either
or
all
precisely
as
the
directions
you
have
received
from
your
home
government
instruct
on
behalf
of
the
three
greatest
latin
countries
as
special
envoy
of
each
i
will
sign
first
he
dropped
into
the
chair
signed
each
of
the
three
parchment
pages
three
times
then
rose
and
offered
the
pen
to
the
cowled
figure
at
one
end
of
the
semicircle
the
man
came
forward
read
the
english
transcript
studied
the
three
signatures
already
there
with
a
certain
air
of
surprise
then
signed
the
second
man
signed
the
third
man
and
the
fourth
the
fifth
had
just
risen
to
go
forward
when
the
door
opened
silently
and
grimm
entered
without
a
glance
either
to
right
or
left
he
went
straight
toward
the
table
and
extended
a
hand
to
take
the
compact
for
an
instant
there
had
come
amazement
a
dumb
astonishment
at
the
intrusion
it
passed
and
the
hand
of
the
man
who
had
done
the
talking
darted
out
seized
the
compact
and
held
it
behind
him
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
give
that
to
me
your
highness
suggested
grimm
quietly
for
half
a
minute
the
masked
man
stared
straight
into
the
listless
eyes
of
the
intruder
and
then
grimm
you
are
in
very
grave
danger
that
is
beside
the
question
was
the
reply
be
good
enough
to
give
me
that
document
he
backed
away
as
he
spoke
kicked
the
door
closed
with
one
heel
then
leaned
against
it
facing
them
or
better
yet
he
went
on
after
a
moment
burn
it
there
is
a
lamp
in
front
of
you
he
paused
for
an
answer
it
would
be
absurd
of
me
to
attempt
to
take
it
by
force
he
added
xxiii
the
percussion
cap
there
was
a
long
tense
silence
the
cowled
figures
had
risen
ominously
miss
thorne
paled
behind
her
mask
and
her
fingers
gripped
her
palms
fiercely
still
she
sat
motionless
prince
broke
the
silence
he
seemed
perfectly
calm
and
how
did
you
get
in
he
demanded
throttled
your
guard
at
the
front
door
took
him
down
cellar
and
locked
him
in
the
replied
grimm
tersely
i
am
waiting
for
you
to
burn
it
and
how
did
you
escape
from
from
the
other
place
grimm
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
lamp
is
in
front
of
you
he
said
and
find
your
way
here
the
prince
pursued
again
grimm
shrugged
his
shoulders
for
an
instant
longer
the
prince
gazed
straight
into
his
inscrutable
face
then
turned
accusing
eyes
on
the
masked
figures
about
him
is
there
a
traitor
he
demanded
suddenly
his
gaze
settled
on
miss
thorne
and
lingered
there
i
can
relieve
your
mind
on
that
point
there
is
not
grimm
assured
him
just
a
final
word
your
highness
if
you
will
permit
me
i
have
heard
everything
that
has
been
said
here
for
the
last
fifteen
minutes
the
details
of
your
percussion
cap
are
interesting
i
shall
lay
them
before
my
government
and
my
government
may
take
it
upon
itself
to
lay
them
before
the
british
government
you
yourself
said
a
few
minutes
ago
that
this
compact
was
not
possible
before
this
cap
was
invented
and
perfected
it
is
possible
the
minute
my
government
is
warned
against
its
use
that
will
be
my
first
duty
you
are
giving
some
very
excellent
reasons
grimm
was
the
deliberate
reply
why
you
should
not
be
permitted
to
leave
this
room
alive
further
grimm
resumed
in
the
same
tone
i
have
been
ordered
to
prevent
the
signing
of
that
compact
at
least
in
this
country
it
seems
that
i
am
barely
in
time
if
it
is
signed
and
it
will
be
useless
now
on
your
own
statement
unless
you
murder
me
every
man
who
signs
it
will
have
to
reckon
with
the
highest
power
of
this
country
will
you
destroy
it
i
do
want
to
know
what
countries
already
stand
committed
by
the
signatures
there
i
will
not
was
the
steady
response
and
then
after
a
little
grimm
the
inventor
of
this
little
cap
insignificant
as
it
seems
will
receive
millions
for
it
your
silence
would
be
worth
just
how
much
grimm
face
turned
red
then
white
again
which
would
you
prefer
an
independence
by
virtue
of
a
great
fortune
or
or
the
other
thing
suddenly
miss
thorne
tore
the
mask
from
her
face
and
came
forward
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
anger
flamed
in
the
eyes
grimm
has
no
price
i
happen
to
know
that
she
declared
hotly
neither
money
nor
a
consideration
for
his
own
personal
safety
will
make
him
turn
traitor
she
stared
coldly
into
the
prince
eyes
and
we
are
not
assassins
here
she
added
miss
thorne
has
stated
the
matter
fairly
i
believe
your
highness
and
grimm
permitted
his
eyes
to
linger
a
moment
on
the
flushed
face
of
this
woman
who
in
a
way
was
defending
him
but
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
miss
thorne
he
was
talking
to
her
now
there
is
no
middle
course
it
is
a
problem
that
has
only
one
possible
answer
the
destruction
of
that
document
and
the
departure
of
you
and
you
your
highness
for
italy
under
my
personal
care
all
the
way
i
imagined
this
matter
had
ended
that
day
on
the
steamer
it
end
here
now
the
prince
glanced
again
at
his
watch
then
thoughtfully
weighed
the
percussion
cap
in
his
hand
after
which
with
a
curious
laugh
he
walked
over
to
the
squat
iron
globe
in
an
opposite
corner
of
the
room
he
bent
over
it
half
a
minute
then
straightened
up
that
cap
grimm
has
one
disadvantage
he
remarked
casually
when
it
is
attached
to
a
mine
or
torpedo
it
can
not
be
disconnected
without
firing
it
it
is
attached
he
turned
to
the
others
it
is
needless
to
discuss
the
matter
further
just
now
if
you
will
follow
me
we
will
leave
grimm
here
with
a
strange
little
cry
neither
anger
nor
anguish
yet
oddly
partaking
of
the
quality
of
each
isabel
went
quickly
to
the
prince
how
dare
you
do
such
a
thing
she
demanded
fiercely
it
is
murder
this
is
not
a
time
miss
thorne
for
your
interference
replied
the
prince
coldly
it
has
all
passed
beyond
the
point
where
the
feelings
of
any
one
person
even
the
feelings
of
the
woman
who
has
engineered
the
compact
can
be
considered
a
single
life
can
not
be
permitted
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
consummation
of
this
world
project
grimm
alive
means
the
compact
would
be
useless
if
not
impossible
grimm
dead
means
the
fruition
of
all
our
plans
and
hopes
you
have
done
your
duty
and
you
have
done
it
well
but
now
your
authority
ends
and
i
the
special
envoy
of
just
a
moment
please
grimm
interrupted
courteously
as
i
understand
it
your
highness
the
mine
there
in
the
corner
is
charged
yes
it
just
happened
to
be
here
for
purposes
of
experiment
the
cap
is
attached
quite
right
the
prince
laughed
and
at
three
by
your
watch
the
mine
will
be
fired
by
a
wireless
operator
fifteen
miles
from
here
something
like
that
yes
very
much
like
that
assented
the
prince
thank
you
i
merely
wanted
to
understand
it
grimm
pulled
a
chair
up
against
the
door
and
sat
down
crossing
his
legs
on
his
knees
rested
the
barrel
of
a
revolver
glittering
fascinating
in
the
now
gentlemen
and
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
minutes
of
three
at
three
that
mine
will
explode
we
will
all
be
in
the
room
when
it
happens
unless
his
highness
sees
fit
to
destroy
the
compact
eyes
sought
eyes
and
the
prince
removed
his
mask
with
a
sudden
gesture
his
face
was
bloodless
if
any
man
and
grimm
gave
miss
thorne
a
quick
glance
i
should
say
attempts
to
leave
this
room
i
he
will
die
and
there
a
bare
chance
that
the
percussion
cap
will
fail
to
work
i
can
account
for
six
of
you
if
there
is
a
rush
but
man
if
that
mine
explodes
we
shall
all
be
killed
blown
to
pieces
burst
from
one
of
the
cowled
figures
if
the
percussion
cap
works
supplemented
grimm
mingled
emotions
struggled
in
the
flushed
face
of
isabel
as
she
studied
grimm
impassive
countenance
i
have
never
disappointed
you
yet
miss
thorne
he
remarked
as
if
it
were
an
explanation
i
shall
not
now
she
turned
to
the
prince
your
highness
i
think
it
needless
to
argue
further
she
said
we
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
there
is
only
one
course
destroy
the
compact
no
was
the
curt
answer
i
believe
i
know
grimm
better
than
you
do
she
argued
you
think
he
will
weaken
i
know
he
will
not
i
am
not
arguing
for
him
nor
for
myself
i
am
arguing
against
the
frightful
loss
that
will
come
here
in
this
room
if
the
compact
is
not
destroyed
illustration
you
think
he
will
weaken
i
know
he
will
not
it
absurd
to
let
one
man
stand
in
the
way
declared
the
prince
angrily
it
might
not
be
an
impertinent
question
your
highness
commented
grimm
for
me
to
ask
how
you
are
going
to
one
man
standing
in
the
way
a
quick
change
came
over
miss
thorne
face
the
eyes
hardened
the
lips
were
set
and
lines
grimm
had
never
seen
appeared
about
the
mouth
here
in
a
flash
the
cloak
of
dissimulation
was
cast
aside
and
the
woman
stood
forth
this
keen
brilliant
determined
woman
who
did
things
the
compact
will
be
destroyed
she
said
no
declared
the
prince
it
be
destroyed
must
do
you
say
to
me
yes
she
repeated
steadily
and
by
what
authority
please
do
by
that
authority
she
drew
a
tiny
filigreed
gold
box
from
her
bosom
and
cast
it
upon
the
table
the
prince
stared
at
it
in
the
name
of
your
sovereign
she
said
again
the
prince
turned
away
and
began
pacing
back
and
forth
across
the
room
with
the
parchment
crumpled
in
his
hand
for
a
minute
or
more
isabel
stood
watching
him
thirteen
minutes
grimm
announced
coldly
and
now
broke
out
an
excited
chatter
a
babel
of
french
english
italian
spanish
those
masked
and
cowled
ones
who
had
held
silence
for
so
long
all
began
talking
at
once
one
of
them
snatched
at
the
crumpled
compact
in
the
prince
hand
while
all
crowded
around
him
arguing
grimm
sat
perfectly
still
with
the
revolver
barrel
resting
on
his
knees
eleven
minutes
he
announced
again
suddenly
the
prince
turned
violently
on
miss
thorne
with
face
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
you
if
i
do
as
you
say
he
demanded
savagely
it
means
you
will
be
branded
as
traitor
that
your
name
your
property
if
you
will
pardon
me
your
highness
she
interrupted
the
power
that
i
have
used
was
given
to
me
to
use
i
have
used
it
it
is
a
matter
to
be
settled
between
me
and
my
government
and
as
far
as
it
affects
my
person
is
of
no
consequence
now
you
will
destroy
the
compact
nine
minutes
said
grimm
monotonously
again
the
babel
broke
out
do
we
understand
that
you
want
to
see
the
compact
one
of
the
cowled
men
asked
suddenly
of
grimm
as
he
turned
no
i
do
want
to
see
it
i
prefer
not
to
see
it
with
hatred
blazing
in
his
eyes
the
prince
made
his
way
toward
the
lamp
holding
a
parchment
toward
the
blaze
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
he
exclaimed
savagely
just
a
moment
please
grimm
interposed
quickly
miss
thorne
is
that
the
compact
she
glanced
at
it
nodded
her
head
and
then
the
flame
caught
the
fringed
edge
of
paper
it
crackled
flashed
flamed
and
at
last
a
thing
of
ashes
was
scattered
on
the
floor
grimm
rose
that
is
all
gentlemen
he
announced
courteously
you
are
free
to
go
you
your
highness
and
miss
thorne
will
accompany
me
he
held
open
the
door
and
there
was
almost
a
scramble
to
get
out
the
prince
and
miss
thorne
waited
until
the
last
and
miss
thorne
if
you
will
give
us
a
lift
in
your
car
grimm
suggested
it
is
now
four
minutes
of
three
the
automobile
came
in
answer
to
a
signal
and
the
three
in
silence
entered
it
the
car
trembled
and
had
just
begun
to
move
when
grimm
remembered
something
and
leaped
out
wait
for
me
he
called
there
a
man
locked
in
the
he
disappeared
into
the
house
and
miss
thorne
with
a
gasp
of
horror
sank
back
in
her
seat
with
face
like
chalk
the
prince
glanced
uneasily
at
his
watch
then
spoke
curtly
to
the
chauffeur
run
the
car
up
out
of
danger
there
be
an
explosion
there
in
a
moment
they
had
gone
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
when
the
building
they
had
just
left
seemed
to
be
lifted
bodily
from
the
ground
by
a
great
spurt
of
flame
which
tore
through
its
center
then
collapsed
like
a
thing
of
cards
the
prince
unmoved
glanced
around
at
miss
thorne
she
lay
in
a
dead
faint
beside
him
go
ahead
he
commanded
baltimore
xxiv
the
personal
equation
campbell
ceased
talking
and
the
deep
earnestness
that
had
settled
on
his
face
passed
leaving
instead
the
blank
inscrutable
mask
of
benevolence
behind
which
his
genius
was
habitually
hidden
the
choleric
blue
eyes
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
shifted
inquiringly
to
the
thoughtful
countenance
of
the
secretary
of
state
at
his
right
thence
along
the
table
around
which
the
official
family
was
gathered
it
was
a
special
meeting
of
the
cabinet
called
at
the
suggestion
of
chief
campbell
and
for
more
than
an
hour
he
had
done
the
talking
there
had
been
no
interruption
so
much
he
concluded
at
last
if
there
is
any
point
i
have
not
made
clear
grimm
is
here
to
explain
it
in
person
grimm
rose
at
the
mention
of
his
name
and
stood
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
chief
executive
listlessly
we
understand
grimm
the
president
began
and
he
paused
for
an
instant
to
regard
the
tall
young
man
with
a
certain
admiration
we
understand
that
there
does
not
actually
exist
such
a
thing
as
a
latin
compact
against
the
peoples
on
paper
no
was
the
reply
you
personally
prevented
the
signing
of
the
compact
i
personally
caused
the
destruction
of
the
compact
after
several
signatures
had
been
attached
grimm
amended
throughout
i
have
acted
under
the
direction
of
campbell
of
course
you
were
in
very
grave
personal
danger
the
president
went
on
it
was
of
no
consequence
said
grimm
simply
the
president
glanced
at
campbell
and
the
chief
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
certain
grimm
and
the
president
spoke
with
great
deliberation
you
are
certain
that
the
representatives
of
the
latin
countries
have
not
met
since
and
signed
the
compact
i
am
not
certain
no
replied
grimm
promptly
i
am
certain
however
that
the
backbone
of
the
alliance
was
broken
its
only
excuse
for
existence
destroyed
when
they
permitted
me
to
learn
of
the
wireless
percussion
cap
which
would
have
placed
the
navies
of
the
world
at
their
mercy
believe
me
gentlemen
if
they
had
kept
their
secret
it
would
have
given
them
dominion
of
the
earth
they
made
one
mistake
he
added
in
a
most
tone
they
should
have
killed
me
it
was
their
only
chance
the
president
seemed
a
little
startled
at
the
suggestion
that
would
have
been
murder
he
remarked
true
grimm
acquiesced
but
it
seems
an
absurd
thing
that
they
should
have
permitted
the
life
of
one
man
to
stand
between
them
and
the
world
power
for
which
they
had
so
long
planned
and
schemed
his
highness
prince
benedetto
believed
as
i
do
and
so
expressed
himself
he
paused
a
moment
there
was
a
hint
of
surprise
in
his
manner
i
expected
to
be
killed
of
course
it
seemed
to
me
the
only
thing
that
could
happen
they
must
have
known
of
the
consequences
which
would
follow
upon
your
escape
grimm
why
they
kill
you
grimm
made
a
little
gesture
with
both
hands
and
was
silent
may
they
not
yet
attempt
it
the
president
insisted
it
too
late
now
grimm
explained
they
had
everything
to
gain
by
killing
me
there
as
i
stood
in
the
room
where
i
had
interrupted
the
signing
of
the
compact
because
that
would
have
been
before
i
had
placed
the
facts
in
the
hands
of
my
government
i
was
the
only
person
outside
of
their
circle
who
knew
all
of
them
only
the
basest
motive
could
inspire
them
to
attempt
my
life
now
there
was
a
pause
the
secretary
of
state
glanced
from
grimm
to
campbell
with
a
question
in
his
eyes
do
i
understand
that
you
placed
a
miss
thorne
and
the
prince
under
that
is
you
detained
them
he
queried
if
so
where
are
they
now
i
do
know
was
the
reply
just
before
the
explosion
the
three
of
us
entered
an
automobile
together
and
then
as
we
were
starting
away
i
remembered
something
which
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
reenter
the
house
when
i
came
out
again
just
a
few
seconds
before
the
explosion
the
prince
and
miss
thorne
had
gone
the
secretary
lips
curled
down
in
disapproval
was
it
rather
unusual
to
put
it
mildly
to
leave
your
prisoners
to
their
own
devices
that
way
he
asked
well
yes
grimm
admitted
but
the
circumstances
were
unusual
when
i
entered
the
house
i
had
locked
a
man
in
the
cellar
i
had
to
go
back
to
save
his
life
otherwise
oh
the
guard
at
the
door
you
mean
came
the
interruption
who
was
it
grimm
glanced
at
his
chief
who
nodded
it
was
charles
winthrop
rankin
of
the
german
embassy
said
the
young
man
rankin
of
the
german
embassy
was
on
guard
at
the
door
demanded
the
president
quickly
yes
we
got
out
safely
and
that
means
that
germany
was
the
president
paused
and
startled
glances
passed
around
the
table
after
a
moment
of
deep
abstraction
the
secretary
went
on
so
miss
thorne
and
the
prince
escaped
are
they
still
in
this
country
that
i
do
know
replied
grimm
he
stood
silent
a
moment
staring
at
the
president
some
subtle
change
crept
into
the
listless
eyes
and
his
lips
were
set
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
here
that
the
personal
equation
enters
largely
into
an
affair
of
this
kind
he
said
at
last
slowly
it
happens
that
it
entered
into
this
unless
i
am
ordered
to
pursue
the
matter
further
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
all
concerned
to
accept
the
fact
of
miss
thorne
escape
and
he
stopped
there
was
a
long
thoughtful
silence
every
man
in
the
room
was
studying
grimm
impassive
face
personal
equation
mused
the
president
just
how
grimm
does
the
personal
equation
enter
into
the
affair
the
young
man
lips
closed
tightly
and
then
there
are
some
people
president
whom
we
meet
frankly
as
enemies
and
we
deal
with
them
accordingly
and
there
are
others
who
oppose
us
and
yet
are
not
enemies
it
is
merely
that
our
paths
of
duty
cross
we
may
have
the
greatest
respect
for
them
and
they
for
us
but
purposes
are
unalterably
different
in
other
words
there
is
a
personal
enmity
and
a
political
enmity
you
for
instance
might
be
a
close
personal
friend
of
the
man
whom
you
defeated
for
president
there
might
he
stopped
suddenly
go
on
urged
the
president
i
think
every
man
meets
once
in
his
life
an
individual
with
whom
he
would
like
to
reckon
personally
the
young
man
continued
that
reckoning
may
not
be
a
severe
one
it
may
be
less
severe
than
the
law
would
provide
but
it
would
be
a
personal
reckoning
there
is
one
individual
in
this
affair
with
whom
i
should
like
to
reckon
hence
the
personal
equation
enters
very
largely
into
the
case
for
a
little
while
the
silence
of
the
room
was
unbroken
save
for
the
steady
of
a
great
clock
in
one
corner
grimm
eyes
were
fixed
unwaveringly
upon
those
of
the
chief
executive
at
last
the
secretary
of
war
crumpled
a
sheet
of
paper
impatiently
and
hitched
his
chair
up
to
the
table
coming
down
to
the
facts
it
like
this
is
it
he
demanded
briskly
the
latin
countries
by
an
invention
of
their
own
which
the
united
states
and
england
were
to
be
duped
into
purchasing
would
have
had
power
to
explode
every
submarine
mine
before
attacking
a
port
very
well
this
thing
of
course
would
have
given
them
the
freedom
of
the
seas
as
long
as
we
were
unable
to
explode
their
submarines
as
they
were
able
to
explode
ours
and
this
is
the
condition
which
made
the
latin
compact
possible
is
it
he
looked
straight
at
grimm
who
nodded
therefore
he
went
on
if
the
latin
compact
is
not
a
reality
on
paper
if
the
united
states
and
england
do
not
purchase
this
this
wireless
percussion
cap
we
are
right
back
where
we
were
before
it
all
happened
are
we
every
possible
danger
from
that
direction
has
passed
has
it
the
of
which
we
have
been
talking
is
rendered
impossible
is
it
that
a
question
answered
grimm
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
suggesting
it
i
would
venture
to
say
that
as
long
as
there
is
an
invention
of
that
importance
in
the
hands
of
nations
whom
we
now
know
have
been
conspiring
against
us
for
fifty
years
there
is
always
danger
it
seems
to
me
if
you
will
pardon
me
again
that
for
the
sake
of
peace
we
must
either
get
complete
control
of
that
invention
or
else
understand
it
so
well
that
there
can
be
no
further
danger
and
again
please
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
brain
which
brought
this
thing
into
existence
is
still
to
be
reckoned
with
there
may
some
day
come
a
time
when
our
submarines
may
be
exploded
at
will
regardless
of
this
percussion
cap
the
secretary
of
war
turned
flatly
upon
chief
campbell
this
woman
who
is
mixed
up
in
this
affair
he
demanded
this
miss
thorne
who
is
she
who
is
she
repeated
the
chief
she
a
secret
agent
of
italy
one
of
the
most
brilliant
perhaps
that
has
ever
operated
in
this
or
any
other
country
she
is
the
pivot
around
which
the
intrigue
moved
we
know
her
by
a
dozen
names
any
one
of
them
may
be
correct
the
brows
of
the
secretary
of
war
were
drawn
down
in
thought
as
he
turned
to
the
president
grimm
was
speaking
of
the
personal
equation
he
remarked
pointedly
i
think
perhaps
his
meaning
is
clear
when
we
know
there
is
a
woman
in
the
case
we
know
that
grimm
has
done
his
duty
to
the
last
inch
in
this
matter
we
know
that
alone
and
unaided
practically
he
has
done
a
thing
that
no
living
man
of
his
relative
position
has
ever
done
before
prevented
a
but
there
is
further
danger
he
himself
has
called
our
attention
to
it
therefore
i
would
suggest
that
grimm
be
relieved
of
further
duty
in
this
particular
case
this
is
not
a
moment
when
the
peace
of
the
world
may
be
imperiled
by
personal
feelings
of
of
kindliness
for
an
individual
grimm
received
the
blow
without
a
tremor
his
hands
were
still
idly
clasped
behind
his
back
the
eyes
fastened
upon
the
president
face
were
still
listless
the
mouth
absolutely
without
expression
as
grimm
has
pointed
out
the
secretary
went
on
we
have
been
negotiating
for
this
wireless
percussion
cap
i
have
somewhere
in
my
office
the
name
and
address
of
the
individual
with
whom
these
negotiations
have
been
conducted
through
that
it
is
possible
to
reach
the
inventor
and
then
i
suggest
that
we
vote
our
thanks
to
grimm
and
relieve
him
of
this
particular
case
the
choleric
eyes
of
the
president
softened
a
little
and
grew
grave
as
they
studied
the
impassive
face
of
the
young
man
it
a
strange
situation
grimm
he
said
evenly
what
do
you
say
to
withdrawing
i
am
at
your
orders
president
was
the
reply
no
one
knows
better
what
you
have
done
than
the
gentlemen
here
at
this
table
the
president
went
on
slowly
no
one
questions
that
you
have
done
more
than
any
other
man
could
have
done
under
the
circumstances
we
understand
i
think
that
indirectly
you
are
asking
immunity
for
an
individual
i
do
happen
to
know
the
liability
of
that
individual
under
our
law
but
we
ca
make
any
mistake
now
grimm
and
so
and
so
he
stopped
and
was
silent
i
had
hoped
president
that
what
i
have
done
so
far
and
i
underestimate
it
would
have
at
least
earned
for
me
the
privilege
of
remaining
in
this
case
until
its
conclusion
said
grimm
steadily
if
it
is
to
be
otherwise
of
course
i
am
at
history
tells
us
grimm
interrupted
the
president
irrelevantly
that
the
of
a
woman
skirt
has
changed
the
map
of
the
world
do
you
believe
he
went
on
suddenly
that
a
man
can
mete
out
justice
fairly
severely
if
necessary
to
one
for
whom
he
has
a
personal
regard
i
do
sir
perhaps
even
to
one
to
a
woman
whom
he
might
love
i
do
sir
the
president
rose
please
wait
in
the
anteroom
for
a
few
minutes
he
directed
grimm
bowed
himself
out
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
was
again
summoned
into
the
cabinet
chamber
the
president
met
him
with
outstretched
hand
there
was
more
than
mere
perfunctory
thanks
in
this
there
was
the
understanding
of
man
and
man
you
will
proceed
with
the
case
to
the
end
grimm
he
instructed
abruptly
if
you
need
assistance
ask
for
it
if
not
proceed
alone
you
will
rely
upon
your
own
judgment
entirely
if
there
are
circumstances
which
make
it
inadvisable
to
move
against
an
individual
by
legal
process
even
if
that
individual
is
amenable
to
our
laws
you
are
not
constrained
so
to
do
if
your
judgment
is
against
it
there
is
one
stipulation
you
will
either
secure
the
complete
rights
of
the
wireless
percussion
cap
to
this
government
or
learn
the
secret
of
the
invention
so
that
at
no
future
time
can
we
be
endangered
by
it
thank
you
said
grimm
quietly
i
understand
i
may
add
that
it
is
a
matter
of
deep
regret
to
me
and
the
president
brought
one
vigorous
hand
down
on
the
young
man
shoulder
that
our
government
has
so
few
men
of
your
type
in
its
service
good
day
xxv
we
two
grimm
turned
from
pennsylvania
avenue
into
a
cross
street
walked
along
half
a
block
or
so
climbed
a
short
flight
of
stairs
and
entered
an
office
is
howard
in
he
queried
of
a
boy
in
attendance
name
please
grimm
handed
over
a
sealed
envelope
which
bore
the
official
imprint
of
the
department
of
war
in
the
upper
left
hand
corner
and
the
boy
disappeared
into
a
room
beyond
a
moment
later
he
emerged
and
held
open
the
door
for
grimm
a
gentleman
howard
rose
from
his
seat
and
stared
at
him
as
he
entered
this
note
grimm
is
surprising
he
remarked
it
is
only
a
request
from
the
secretary
of
war
that
i
be
permitted
to
meet
the
inventor
of
the
wireless
percussion
cap
grimm
explained
carelessly
the
negotiations
have
reached
a
point
where
the
war
department
must
have
one
or
two
questions
answered
directly
by
the
inventor
simple
enough
you
see
but
it
has
been
understood
and
i
have
personally
impressed
it
upon
the
secretary
of
war
that
such
a
meeting
is
impossible
objected
howard
all
negotiations
have
been
conducted
through
me
and
i
have
as
attorney
for
the
inventor
the
right
to
answer
any
question
that
may
properly
be
answered
this
now
is
a
request
for
a
personal
interview
with
the
inventor
the
necessity
for
such
an
interview
has
risen
unexpectedly
because
of
a
pressing
need
of
either
closing
the
deal
or
allowing
it
to
drop
grimm
stated
i
may
add
that
the
success
of
the
deal
depends
entirely
on
this
interview
howard
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
with
wrinkled
brow
intently
studying
the
calm
face
of
the
young
man
innocent
himself
of
all
the
intrigue
and
international
chicanery
back
of
the
affair
representing
only
an
individual
in
these
secret
negotiations
he
saw
in
the
statement
as
grimm
intended
that
he
should
the
possible
climax
of
a
great
business
contract
his
greed
was
aroused
it
might
mean
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
him
do
you
think
the
deal
can
be
made
he
asked
at
last
i
have
no
doubt
there
will
be
some
sort
of
a
deal
replied
grimm
as
i
say
however
it
is
absolutely
dependent
on
an
interview
between
the
inventor
and
myself
at
once
this
afternoon
howard
thoughtfully
drummed
on
his
desk
for
a
little
while
from
the
first
save
in
so
far
as
the
patent
rights
were
concerned
he
had
seen
no
reasons
for
the
obligations
of
utter
secrecy
which
had
been
enforced
upon
him
perhaps
if
he
laid
it
before
the
inventor
in
this
new
light
with
the
deal
practically
closed
the
interview
would
be
possible
i
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
grimm
he
said
at
last
i
shall
have
to
put
it
to
my
client
of
course
can
you
give
me
say
half
an
hour
to
communicate
with
him
certainly
and
grimm
rose
obligingly
shall
i
wait
outside
here
or
call
again
you
may
wait
if
you
do
mind
said
howard
i
be
able
to
let
you
know
in
a
few
minutes
i
hope
grimm
bowed
and
passed
out
at
the
end
of
minutes
the
door
of
howard
private
office
opened
and
he
appeared
his
face
was
violently
red
evidently
from
anger
and
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
i
ca
do
anything
with
him
he
declared
savagely
he
says
simply
that
negotiations
must
be
conducted
through
me
or
not
at
all
grimm
had
risen
he
bowed
courteously
very
well
he
said
placidly
you
understand
of
course
as
the
note
says
that
this
refusal
of
his
terminates
the
negotiations
so
but
just
a
moment
interposed
howard
quickly
good
day
said
grimm
the
door
opened
and
closed
he
was
gone
three
minutes
later
he
stepped
into
a
telephone
booth
at
a
corner
and
took
down
the
receiver
hello
central
he
called
and
then
this
is
grimm
of
the
secret
service
what
number
was
howard
talking
to
eleven
six
alexandria
was
the
reply
where
is
the
connection
in
whose
name
the
connection
is
five
miles
out
from
alexandria
in
a
on
the
old
baltimore
road
came
the
crisp
answer
the
name
is
murdock
williams
thank
you
said
grimm
a
moment
later
he
was
standing
by
the
curb
waiting
for
a
car
when
howard
still
angry
and
with
an
expression
of
deep
chagrin
on
his
face
came
bustling
up
if
you
can
give
me
until
afternoon
then
he
began
grimm
glanced
around
at
him
and
with
a
slight
motion
of
his
head
summoned
two
men
who
had
been
chatting
one
of
them
was
blair
and
the
other
hastings
take
this
man
in
charge
he
directed
hold
him
in
solitary
confinement
until
you
hear
from
me
do
talk
to
him
do
let
any
one
else
talk
to
him
and
do
let
him
talk
if
any
person
speaks
to
him
before
he
is
locked
up
take
that
person
in
charge
also
he
is
guilty
of
no
crime
but
a
single
word
from
him
now
will
endanger
my
life
that
was
all
it
was
said
and
done
so
quickly
that
howard
dazed
confused
and
utterly
unable
to
account
for
anything
was
led
away
without
a
protest
grimm
musing
gently
on
the
stupidity
of
mankind
in
general
and
the
ease
with
which
it
is
possible
to
lead
even
a
clever
individual
into
a
trap
if
the
bait
appeals
to
greed
took
a
car
and
went
up
town
some
three
hours
later
he
walked
briskly
along
a
narrow
path
strewn
with
pine
needles
which
led
tortuously
up
to
an
old
colonial
farmhouse
outwardly
the
place
seemed
to
be
deserted
the
blinds
battered
and
stripped
of
paint
by
wind
and
rain
were
all
closed
and
one
corner
of
the
small
veranda
had
crumbled
away
from
age
and
neglect
in
the
rear
of
the
house
rising
from
an
old
barn
a
thin
pole
with
a
attachment
at
the
apex
thrust
its
point
into
the
open
above
the
dense
odorous
pines
grimm
noted
these
things
as
he
came
along
he
stepped
up
quietly
on
the
veranda
and
had
just
extended
one
hand
to
rap
on
the
door
when
it
was
opened
from
within
and
miss
thorne
stood
before
him
he
was
not
surprised
intuition
had
told
him
he
would
meet
her
again
perhaps
here
in
hiding
a
sudden
quick
tenderness
lighted
the
listless
eyes
for
an
instant
she
stood
staring
her
face
pallid
against
the
gloom
of
the
hallway
beyond
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
she
pressed
one
hand
to
her
breast
the
eyes
were
veiled
by
drooping
lids
then
she
recovered
herself
and
they
opened
into
his
in
them
he
saw
anxiety
apprehension
fear
even
miss
thorne
he
greeted
and
he
bowed
low
over
the
white
hand
which
she
impulsively
thrust
toward
him
i
i
knew
some
one
was
coming
she
stammered
in
a
half
whisper
i
did
know
it
was
you
i
had
known
definitely
until
this
instant
that
you
were
safe
from
the
explosion
i
am
glad
glad
you
understand
glad
that
you
were
not
she
stopped
and
fought
back
her
emotions
then
went
on
but
you
must
not
come
in
you
must
go
away
at
once
your
your
life
is
in
danger
here
did
you
know
i
was
coming
inquired
grimm
from
the
moment
howard
telephoned
she
replied
still
hastily
still
in
the
mysterious
half
whisper
i
knew
that
it
could
only
be
some
one
from
your
bureau
and
i
hoped
that
it
was
you
i
saw
how
you
forced
him
to
call
us
up
here
and
that
was
all
you
needed
it
was
simple
of
course
to
trace
the
telephone
call
both
of
her
hands
closed
over
one
of
his
desperately
now
go
please
the
latin
compact
is
at
an
end
you
merely
invite
death
here
now
go
her
eyes
were
searching
the
listless
face
with
entreaty
in
them
the
slender
fingers
were
fiercely
gripping
one
of
grimm
nerveless
hands
for
an
instant
some
strange
softening
light
flickered
in
the
young
man
eyes
then
it
passed
i
have
no
choice
miss
thorne
he
said
gravely
at
last
i
am
honor
bound
by
my
government
to
do
one
of
two
things
if
i
fail
in
the
first
of
those
the
greater
it
can
only
be
because
he
stopped
hope
flamed
up
in
her
eyes
and
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
studying
the
impassive
face
because
she
repeated
it
can
only
be
because
i
am
killed
he
added
quietly
suddenly
his
whole
manner
changed
i
should
like
to
see
the
the
inventor
but
do
you
see
do
you
see
you
be
killed
if
she
began
tensely
may
i
see
the
inventor
please
grimm
interrupted
for
a
little
time
she
stood
white
and
rigid
staring
at
him
then
her
lids
fluttered
down
wearily
as
if
to
veil
some
crushing
agony
within
her
and
she
stepped
aside
grimm
entered
and
the
door
closed
noiselessly
behind
him
after
a
moment
her
hand
rested
lightly
on
his
arm
and
he
was
led
into
a
room
to
his
left
this
door
too
she
closed
immediately
turning
to
face
him
we
may
talk
here
a
few
minutes
without
interruption
she
said
in
a
low
tone
her
voice
was
quite
calm
now
if
you
will
be
please
understand
miss
thorne
he
interposed
mercilessly
that
i
must
see
the
inventor
whoever
he
is
what
assurance
have
i
that
this
is
not
some
ruse
to
permit
him
to
escape
you
have
my
word
of
honor
she
said
quite
simply
please
go
on
he
sat
down
you
will
see
him
too
soon
i
fear
she
continued
slowly
if
you
had
not
come
to
him
he
would
have
gone
to
you
she
swayed
a
little
and
pressed
one
hand
to
her
eyes
i
would
to
god
it
were
in
my
power
to
prevent
that
meeting
she
exclaimed
desperately
then
with
an
effort
there
are
some
things
i
want
to
explain
to
you
it
may
be
that
you
will
be
willing
to
go
then
of
your
own
free
will
if
i
lay
bare
to
you
every
step
i
have
taken
since
i
have
been
in
washington
if
i
make
clear
to
you
every
obscure
point
in
this
hideous
intrigue
if
i
confess
to
you
that
the
latin
compact
has
been
given
up
for
all
time
wo
that
be
enough
wo
you
go
then
grimm
teeth
closed
with
a
snap
i
do
want
that
from
you
he
declared
but
if
i
should
tell
it
all
to
you
she
pleaded
i
wo
listen
miss
thorne
you
once
paid
me
the
compliment
of
saying
that
i
was
one
man
you
knew
in
whom
you
had
never
been
disappointed
the
listless
eyes
were
blazing
into
her
own
now
have
never
been
disappointed
in
you
i
will
not
permit
you
to
disappoint
me
now
the
secrets
of
your
government
are
mine
if
i
can
get
them
but
i
wo
allow
you
to
tell
them
to
me
my
government
miss
thorne
repeated
and
her
lips
curled
sadly
i
i
have
no
government
i
have
been
cast
off
by
that
government
stripped
of
my
rank
and
branded
as
a
traitor
traitor
grimm
lips
formed
the
word
silently
i
failed
do
you
see
she
rushed
on
ignominy
is
the
reward
of
failure
prince
went
on
to
new
york
that
night
cabled
a
full
account
of
the
destruction
of
the
compact
to
my
government
and
sailed
home
on
the
following
day
i
was
the
responsible
one
and
now
it
all
comes
back
on
me
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
it
so
singular
grimm
the
fight
from
the
first
was
between
us
we
two
and
you
won
xxvi
in
which
they
both
win
grimm
dropped
into
a
chair
with
his
teeth
clenched
and
his
face
like
chalk
for
a
minute
or
more
he
sat
there
turning
it
all
over
in
his
mind
truly
the
triumph
had
been
robbed
of
its
splendor
when
the
blow
fell
here
here
upon
a
woman
he
loved
there
no
shame
in
the
confession
of
one
who
is
fairly
beaten
isabel
went
on
softly
after
a
little
there
are
many
things
that
you
understand
i
came
to
washington
with
an
authority
from
my
sovereign
higher
even
than
that
vested
in
the
ambassador
i
came
i
did
and
compelled
count
di
rosini
to
obtain
an
invitation
to
the
state
ball
for
me
in
order
that
i
might
meet
a
representative
of
russia
there
that
night
and
receive
an
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
join
the
compact
i
received
that
answer
its
substance
is
of
no
consequence
now
and
you
remember
where
i
first
met
you
it
was
while
you
were
investigating
the
shooting
of
se√±or
alvarez
in
the
german
embassy
that
shooting
as
you
know
was
done
by
prince
so
almost
from
the
beginning
my
plans
went
wrong
because
of
the
assumption
of
authority
by
the
prince
the
paper
he
took
from
se√±or
alvarez
after
the
shooting
was
supposed
to
bear
vitally
upon
mexico
attitude
toward
our
plan
but
as
it
developed
it
was
about
another
matter
entirely
yes
i
know
said
grimm
the
event
of
that
night
which
you
did
learn
was
that
germany
agreed
to
join
the
compact
upon
conditions
rankin
who
was
attached
to
the
german
embassy
in
an
advisory
capacity
delivered
the
answer
to
me
and
i
pretended
to
faint
in
order
that
i
might
reasonably
avoid
you
i
surmised
that
much
remarked
grimm
the
telegraphing
i
did
with
my
fan
was
as
much
to
distract
your
attention
as
anything
else
and
at
the
same
time
to
identify
myself
to
rankin
whom
i
had
never
met
you
knew
him
of
course
i
did
she
was
silent
a
while
as
her
eyes
steadily
met
those
of
grimm
finally
she
went
on
when
next
i
met
you
it
was
in
the
venezuelan
legation
you
were
investigating
the
theft
of
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
from
the
safe
i
thrust
myself
into
that
case
because
i
was
afraid
of
you
and
mercilessly
destroyed
a
woman
name
in
your
eyes
to
further
my
plans
i
made
you
believe
that
se√±orita
rodriguez
stole
that
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
i
returned
it
to
you
presumably
while
we
stood
in
her
room
that
night
only
it
was
not
her
room
it
was
stole
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
all
the
details
even
to
her
trip
to
see
griswold
in
baltimore
in
company
with
cadwallader
had
been
carefully
worked
out
and
she
bring
me
the
combination
of
the
safe
from
griswold
on
the
strength
of
a
forged
letter
but
she
know
it
there
was
no
theft
of
course
i
had
no
intention
of
keeping
the
money
it
was
necessary
to
take
it
to
distract
attention
from
the
thing
i
do
break
a
lock
inside
the
safe
to
get
a
sealed
packet
that
contained
venezuela
answer
to
our
plan
i
sealed
that
packet
again
and
there
was
never
a
suspicion
that
it
had
been
opened
only
a
suspicion
grimm
corrected
then
came
the
abduction
of
monsieur
boiss√©gur
the
french
ambassador
i
plunged
into
that
case
as
i
did
in
the
other
because
i
was
afraid
of
you
and
had
to
know
just
how
much
you
knew
it
was
explained
to
you
as
an
attempt
at
extortion
with
details
which
i
carefully
supplied
as
a
matter
of
fact
monsieur
boiss√©gur
opposed
our
plans
even
endangered
them
and
it
was
not
advisable
to
have
him
recalled
or
even
permit
him
to
resign
at
the
moment
so
we
abducted
him
intending
to
hold
him
until
direct
orders
could
reach
him
from
paris
understand
please
that
all
these
things
were
made
possible
by
the
aid
and
cooperation
of
dozens
scores
of
agents
who
were
under
my
orders
every
person
who
appeared
in
that
abduction
was
working
at
my
direction
the
unexpected
escape
disarranged
our
plans
but
he
was
taken
out
of
the
embassy
by
force
the
second
time
under
your
very
eyes
the
darkness
which
made
this
possible
was
due
to
the
fact
that
while
you
were
looking
for
the
switch
and
i
was
apparently
aiding
i
was
holding
my
hand
over
it
all
the
time
to
keep
you
from
turning
on
the
light
you
remember
that
grimm
nodded
all
the
rest
of
it
you
know
she
concluded
wearily
you
compelled
me
to
leave
the
venezuelan
legation
by
your
espionage
but
in
the
crowded
hotel
to
which
i
moved
i
had
little
difficulty
avoiding
your
hastings
your
blair
and
your
johnson
so
i
came
and
went
freely
without
your
knowledge
the
escape
of
the
prince
from
prison
you
arranged
so
you
understand
all
of
that
as
well
as
the
meeting
and
attempted
signing
of
the
compact
and
the
rapid
recovery
of
se√±or
alvarez
and
after
all
it
was
my
fault
that
our
plans
failed
because
if
i
had
not
been
been
uneasy
as
to
your
condition
and
had
not
made
the
mistake
of
going
to
the
deserted
little
house
where
you
were
a
prisoner
the
plans
would
have
succeeded
the
compact
been
signed
i
beginning
to
understand
said
grimm
gravely
and
a
wistful
tender
look
crept
into
his
eyes
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
act
of
consideration
and
kindness
to
me
we
would
have
succeeded
in
spite
of
you
explained
isabel
we
were
afraid
of
you
grimm
it
was
a
compliment
to
you
that
we
considered
it
necessary
to
account
for
your
whereabouts
at
the
time
of
the
signing
of
the
compact
and
if
you
had
succeeded
remarked
grimm
the
whole
civilized
world
would
have
come
to
war
i
never
permitted
myself
to
think
of
it
that
way
she
replied
frankly
there
is
something
splendid
to
me
in
a
battle
of
brains
there
is
exaltation
stimulation
excitement
in
it
it
has
always
possessed
the
greatest
fascination
for
me
i
have
always
won
you
know
until
now
i
failed
and
my
reward
is
just
a
word
of
assurance
now
she
went
on
after
a
moment
the
latin
compact
has
been
definitely
given
up
the
plan
has
been
dismissed
thanks
to
you
the
peace
of
the
world
is
unbroken
and
who
am
i
i
know
you
have
wondered
i
know
your
agents
have
scoured
the
world
to
find
out
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
former
italian
ambassador
to
the
court
of
james
my
mother
was
an
english
woman
i
was
born
and
received
my
early
education
in
england
hence
my
perfect
knowledge
of
that
tongue
in
rome
i
am
or
have
been
alas
the
countess
rosa
now
i
am
an
exile
with
a
price
on
my
head
that
is
all
except
for
several
years
i
was
a
trusted
agent
of
my
government
and
a
friend
of
my
queen
she
rose
and
extended
both
hands
graciously
grimm
seized
the
slender
white
fingers
and
stood
with
eyes
fixed
upon
hers
slowly
a
flush
crept
into
her
pallid
cheeks
and
she
bowed
her
head
wonderful
woman
he
said
softly
i
shall
ask
a
favor
of
you
now
she
went
on
gently
let
all
this
that
you
have
learned
take
the
place
of
whatever
you
expected
to
learn
and
go
believe
me
there
can
only
be
one
result
if
you
meet
if
you
meet
the
inventor
of
the
wireless
cap
upon
which
so
much
was
staked
and
so
much
lost
she
shuddered
a
little
then
raised
the
eyes
beseechingly
to
his
face
please
go
go
the
word
straightened
grimm
in
his
tracks
and
he
allowed
her
hands
to
fall
limply
suddenly
his
face
grew
hard
in
the
ecstasy
of
adoration
he
had
momentarily
forgotten
his
purpose
here
his
eyes
lost
their
ardor
his
nerveless
hands
dropped
beside
him
no
he
said
you
must
you
must
she
urged
gently
i
know
what
it
means
to
you
you
feel
it
your
duty
to
unravel
the
secret
of
the
percussion
cap
you
ca
no
man
can
no
one
knows
the
inventor
more
intimately
than
i
and
even
i
could
get
it
from
him
there
are
no
plans
for
it
in
existence
and
even
if
there
were
he
would
no
more
sell
them
than
you
would
have
accepted
a
fortune
at
the
hands
of
prince
to
remain
silent
the
compact
has
failed
you
did
that
the
agents
have
scattered
gone
to
other
duties
that
is
enough
no
said
grimm
there
was
a
strange
fear
tearing
at
his
heart
no
one
knows
the
inventor
more
intimately
than
i
no
he
said
again
i
won
from
my
government
a
promise
to
be
made
good
upon
a
condition
i
must
fulfil
that
condition
but
there
is
nothing
promotion
honor
reward
that
would
compensate
you
for
the
loss
of
your
life
she
entreated
there
is
still
time
she
was
pleading
now
with
her
slim
white
hands
resting
on
his
shoulders
and
the
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
it
more
than
all
that
he
said
that
condition
is
you
your
safety
for
me
she
repeated
for
me
then
wo
you
go
for
for
my
sake
no
wo
you
go
if
you
know
you
will
be
killed
and
suddenly
her
face
turned
scarlet
and
that
your
life
is
dear
to
me
no
isabel
dropped
upon
her
knees
before
him
this
inventor
this
man
whom
you
insist
on
seeing
is
half
insane
with
disappointment
and
anger
she
rushed
on
desperately
remember
that
a
vast
fortune
honor
fame
were
at
his
finger
tips
when
you
you
placed
them
beyond
his
reach
by
the
destruction
of
the
compact
he
has
sworn
to
kill
you
i
ca
go
if
you
that
when
you
meet
one
of
you
will
die
no
the
answer
came
fiercely
through
clenched
teeth
grimm
disengaged
his
right
hand
and
drew
his
revolver
the
barrel
clicked
under
his
fingers
as
it
spun
if
i
tell
you
that
of
the
two
human
beings
in
this
world
whom
i
love
this
man
is
one
no
a
shuffling
step
sounded
in
the
hallway
just
outside
grimm
stepped
back
from
the
kneeling
figure
and
turned
to
face
the
door
with
his
revolver
ready
great
god
it
was
a
scream
of
agony
he
is
my
brother
do
you
see
she
came
to
her
feet
and
went
staggering
across
to
the
door
the
key
clicked
in
the
lock
your
brother
exclaimed
grimm
he
would
listen
to
me
would
listen
to
me
and
now
and
god
have
mercy
there
was
a
sharp
rattling
a
clamor
at
the
door
and
isabel
turned
to
grimm
mutely
with
arms
outstretched
the
revolver
barrel
clicked
under
his
hand
then
after
a
moment
he
replaced
the
weapon
in
his
pocket
please
open
the
door
he
requested
quietly
he
kill
you
she
screamed
exhausted
helpless
she
leaned
against
a
chair
with
her
face
in
her
hands
grimm
went
to
her
suddenly
tore
the
hands
from
her
face
and
met
the
eyes
i
love
you
he
said
i
want
you
to
know
that
and
i
love
you
that
why
it
matters
so
leaving
her
there
grimm
strode
straight
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
he
saw
only
the
outline
of
a
thin
little
man
of
indeterminate
age
then
came
a
blinding
flash
under
his
eyes
and
he
leaped
forward
there
was
a
short
sharp
struggle
and
both
went
down
the
revolver
he
must
get
that
he
reached
for
it
with
the
one
idea
of
disarming
this
madman
the
muzzle
was
thrust
toward
him
he
threw
up
his
arm
to
protect
his
head
and
then
came
a
second
flash
instantly
he
felt
the
figure
in
his
arms
grow
limp
and
after
a
moment
he
rose
the
face
of
the
man
on
the
floor
was
pearly
gray
and
a
thin
scarlet
thread
flowed
from
his
temple
illustration
in
a
stride
grimm
was
beside
her
he
turned
toward
isabel
she
lay
near
the
chair
a
little
crumpled
heap
in
a
stride
he
was
beside
her
and
had
lifted
her
head
to
his
knee
the
eyes
opened
into
his
once
then
they
closed
she
had
fainted
the
first
bullet
had
pierced
her
arm
it
was
only
a
flesh
wound
he
lifted
her
gently
and
placed
her
on
a
couch
after
which
he
disappeared
into
another
room
in
a
little
while
there
came
the
cheerful
of
a
telephone
bell
is
this
the
county
constable
office
he
inquired
well
been
a
little
shooting
accident
at
the
murdock
williams

hours
from
now

up
grimm

service

and

will

and
a
few
minutes
later
grimm
walked
along
the
road
toward
an
automobile
a
hundred
yards
away
bearing
miss
thorne
in
his
arms
the
chauffeur
cranked
the
machine
and
climbed
to
his
seat
