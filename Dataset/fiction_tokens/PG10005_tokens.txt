voyage
to

reprinted
from
american
quarterly
no
march
appeal
to
the
public
having
by
a
train
of
fortunate
circumstances
accomplished
a
voyage
of
which
the
history
of
mankind
affords
no
example
having
moreover
exerted
every
faculty
of
body
and
mind
to
make
my
adventures
useful
to
my
countrymen
and
even
to
mankind
by
imparting
to
them
the
acquisition
of
secrets
in
physics
and
morals
of
which
they
had
not
formed
the
faintest
conception
i
flattered
myself
that
both
in
the
character
of
traveller
and
public
benefactor
i
had
earned
for
myself
an
immortal
name
but
how
these
fond
these
justifiable
hopes
have
been
answered
the
following
narrative
will
show
on
my
return
to
this
my
native
state
as
soon
as
it
was
noised
abroad
that
i
had
met
with
extraordinary
adventures
and
made
a
most
wonderful
voyage
crowds
of
people
pressed
eagerly
to
see
me
i
at
first
met
their
inquiries
with
a
cautious
silence
which
however
but
sharpened
their
curiosity
at
length
i
was
visited
by
a
near
relation
with
whom
i
felt
less
disposed
to
reserve
with
friendly
solicitude
he
inquired
how
much
i
had
made
by
my
voyage
and
when
he
was
informed
that
although
i
had
added
to
my
knowledge
i
had
not
improved
my
fortune
he
stared
at
me
a
while
and
remarking
that
he
had
business
at
the
bank
as
well
as
an
appointment
on
suddenly
took
his
leave
after
this
i
was
not
much
interrupted
by
the
tribe
of
inquisitive
idlers
but
was
visited
principally
by
a
few
men
of
science
who
wished
to
learn
what
i
could
add
to
their
knowledge
of
nature
to
this
class
i
was
more
communicative
and
when
i
severally
informed
them
that
i
had
actually
been
to
the
moon
some
of
them
shrugged
their
shoulders
others
laughed
in
my
face
and
some
were
angry
at
my
supposed
attempt
to
deceive
them
but
all
with
a
single
exception
were
incredulous
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
i
appealed
to
my
former
character
for
veracity
i
was
answered
that
travelling
had
changed
my
morals
as
it
had
changed
other
people
i
asked
what
motives
i
could
have
for
attempting
to
deceive
them
they
replied
the
love
of
distinction
the
vanity
of
being
thought
to
have
seen
what
had
been
seen
by
no
other
mortal
and
they
triumphantly
asked
me
in
turn
what
motives
raleigh
and
riley
and
hunter
and
a
hundred
other
travellers
had
for
their
misrepresentations
finding
argument
thus
unavailing
i
produced
visible
and
tangible
proofs
of
the
truth
of
my
narrative
i
showed
them
a
specimen
of
moonstone
they
asserted
that
it
was
of
the
same
character
as
those
meteoric
stones
which
had
been
found
in
every
part
of
the
world
and
that
i
had
merely
procured
a
piece
of
one
of
these
for
the
purpose
of
deception
i
then
exhibited
some
of
what
i
considered
my
most
curious
lunar
plants
but
this
made
the
matter
worse
for
it
so
happened
that
similar
ones
were
then
cultivated
in
mr
prince
garden
at
flushing
i
next
produced
some
rare
insects
and
feathers
of
singular
birds
but
persons
were
found
who
had
either
seen
or
read
or
heard
of
similar
insects
and
birds
in
or
paraguay
or
prince
of
wales
island
in
short
having
made
up
their
minds
that
what
i
said
was
not
true
they
had
an
answer
ready
for
all
that
i
could
urge
in
support
of
my
character
and
those
who
judged
most
christianly
defended
my
veracity
at
the
expense
of
my
understanding
and
ascribed
my
conduct
to
partial
insanity
there
was
indeed
a
short
suspension
to
this
cruel
distrust
an
old
friend
coming
to
see
me
one
day
and
admiring
a
beautiful
crystal
which
i
had
brought
from
the
moon
insisted
on
showing
it
to
a
jeweller
who
said
that
it
was
an
unusually
hard
stone
and
that
if
it
were
a
diamond
it
would
be
worth
upwards
of
dollars
i
know
not
whether
the
mistake
that
ensued
proceeded
from
my
friend
who
is
something
of
a
wag
or
from
one
of
the
lads
in
the
jeweller
shop
who
hearing
a
part
of
what
his
master
had
said
misapprehended
the
rest
but
so
it
was
that
the
next
day
i
had
more
visiters
than
ever
and
among
them
my
kinsman
who
was
kind
enough
to
stay
with
me
as
if
he
enjoyed
my
good
fortune
until
both
the
exchange
and
the
banks
were
closed
on
the
same
day
the
following
paragraph
appeared
in
one
of
the
morning
prints
we
understand
that
our
enterprising
and
intelligent
traveller
joseph
atterley
esquire
has
brought
from
his
lunar
expedition
a
diamond
of
extraordinary
size
and
lustre
several
of
the
most
experienced
jewellers
of
this
city
have
estimated
it
at
from
to
dollars
and
some
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
it
would
be
cheap
at
half
a
million
we
have
the
authority
of
a
near
relative
of
that
gentleman
for
asserting
that
the
satisfactory
testimonials
which
he
possesses
of
the
correctness
of
his
narrative
are
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
most
incredulous
and
to
silence
malignity
itself
but
this
gleam
of
sunshine
soon
passed
away
two
days
afterwards
another
paragraph
appeared
in
the
same
paper
in
these
words
we
are
credibly
informed
that
the
supposed
diamond
of
the
traveller
to
the
moon
turns
out
to
be
one
of
those
which
are
found
on
diamond
island
in
lake
george
we
have
heard
that
a
y
means
to
favour
the
public
with
an
account
of
his
travels
under
the
title
of
adventures
but
we
would
take
the
liberty
of
recommending
that
for
he
substitute
thus
disappointed
in
my
expectations
and
assailed
in
my
character
what
could
i
do
but
appeal
to
an
impartial
public
by
giving
them
a
circumstantial
detail
of
what
was
most
memorable
in
my
adventures
that
they
might
judge
from
intrinsic
evidence
whether
i
was
deficient
either
in
soundness
of
understanding
or
of
moral
principle
but
let
me
first
bespeak
their
candour
and
a
salutary
diffidence
of
themselves
by
one
or
two
anecdotes
during
the
reign
of
louis
the
xivth
the
king
of
siam
having
received
an
ambassador
from
that
monarch
was
accustomed
to
hear
with
wonder
and
delight
the
foreigner
descriptions
of
his
own
country
but
the
minister
having
one
day
mentioned
that
in
france
water
at
one
time
of
the
year
became
a
solid
substance
the
siamese
prince
indignantly
exclaimed
hold
sir
i
have
listened
to
the
strange
things
you
have
told
me
and
have
hitherto
believed
them
all
but
now
when
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
water
which
i
know
as
well
as
you
can
become
hard
i
see
that
your
purpose
is
to
deceive
me
and
i
do
not
believe
a
word
you
have
uttered
but
as
the
present
patriotic
preference
for
manufactures
may
extend
to
anecdotes
as
well
as
to
other
productions
a
story
of
domestic
origin
may
have
more
weight
with
most
of
my
readers
than
one
introduced
from
abroad
the
chief
of
a
party
of
indians
who
had
visited
washington
during
jefferson
presidency
having
on
his
return
home
assembled
his
tribe
gave
them
a
detail
of
his
adventures
and
dwelling
particularly
upon
the
courteous
treatment
the
party
had
received
from
their
great
father
stated
among
other
things
that
he
had
given
them
ice
though
it
was
then
his
countrymen
not
having
the
vivacity
of
our
ladies
listened
in
silence
till
he
had
ended
when
an
aged
chief
stepped
forth
and
remarked
that
he
too
when
a
young
man
had
visited
their
great
father
washington
in
who
had
received
him
as
a
son
and
treated
him
with
all
the
delicacies
that
his
country
afforded
but
had
given
him
no
ice
now
added
the
orator
if
any
man
in
the
world
could
have
made
ice
in
the
summer
it
was
washington
and
if
he
could
have
made
it
i
am
sure
he
would
have
given
it
to
me
tustanaggee
is
therefore
a
liar
and
not
to
be
believed
in
both
these
cases
though
the
argument
seemed
fair
the
conclusion
was
false
for
had
either
the
king
or
the
chief
taken
the
trouble
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
fact
he
might
have
found
that
his
limited
experience
had
deceived
him
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
if
travellers
sometimes
impose
on
the
credulity
of
mankind
they
are
often
also
not
believed
when
they
speak
the
truth
credulity
and
scepticism
are
indeed
but
different
names
for
the
same
hasty
judgment
on
insufficient
evidence
and
as
the
old
woman
readily
assented
that
there
might
be
mountains
of
sugar
and
rivers
of
rum
because
she
had
seen
them
both
but
that
there
were
fish
which
could
fly
she
never
would
believe
so
thousands
give
credit
to
redheiffer
patented
discovery
of
perpetual
motion
because
they
had
beheld
his
machine
and
question
the
existence
of
the
because
they
have
not
seen
it
i
would
respectfully
remind
that
class
of
my
readers
who
like
the
king
the
indian
or
the
old
woman
refuse
to
credit
any
thing
which
contradicts
the
narrow
limits
of
their
own
observation
that
there
are
more
secrets
in
nature
than
are
dreamt
of
in
their
philosophy
and
that
upon
their
own
principles
before
they
have
a
right
to
condemn
me
they
should
go
or
send
to
the
mountains
of
ava
for
some
of
the
metal
with
which
i
made
my
venturous
experiment
and
make
one
for
themselves
as
to
those
who
do
not
call
in
question
my
veracity
but
only
doubt
my
sanity
i
fearlessly
appeal
from
their
unkind
judgment
to
the
sober
and
unprejudiced
part
of
mankind
whether
what
i
have
stated
in
the
following
pages
is
not
consonant
with
truth
and
nature
and
whether
they
do
not
there
see
faithfully
reflected
from
the
moon

errors
of
the
learned
on

and
the
follies
of

birth
and

he
makes
a
voyage
founders
off

burman

adventures
in

empire
meets
with
a
learned
brahmin
from
being
about
to
give
a
narrative
of
my
singular
adventures
to
the
world
which
i
foresee
will
be
greatly
divided
about
their
authenticity
i
will
premise
something
of
my
early
history
that
those
to
whom
i
am
not
personally
known
may
be
better
able
to
ascertain
what
credit
is
due
to
the
facts
which
rest
only
on
my
own
assertion
i
was
born
in
the
village
of
huntingdon
on
on
the
day
of
may
joseph
atterley
my
father
formerly
of
east
jersey
as
it
was
once
called
had
settled
in
this
place
about
a
year
before
in
consequence
of
having
married
my
mother
alice
schermerhorn
the
only
daughter
of
a
snug
dutch
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
by
means
of
the
portion
he
received
with
my
mother
together
with
his
own
earnings
he
was
enabled
to
quit
the
life
of
a
sailor
to
which
he
had
been
bred
and
to
enter
into
trade
after
the
death
of
his
by
whose
will
he
received
a
handsome
accession
to
his
property
he
sought
in
the
city
of
a
theatre
better
suited
to
his
enlarged
capital
he
here
engaged
in
foreign
trade
and
partaking
of
the
prosperity
which
then
attended
american
commerce
he
gradually
extended
his
business
and
finally
embarked
in
our
new
branch
of
traffic
to
the
east
indies
and
china
he
was
now
very
generally
respected
both
for
his
wealth
and
fair
dealing
was
several
years
a
director
in
one
of
the
insurance
offices
was
president
of
the
society
for
relieving
the
widows
and
orphans
of
distressed
seamen
and
it
is
said
might
have
been
chosen
alderman
if
he
had
not
refused
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
think
himself
qualified
my
father
was
not
one
of
those
who
set
little
value
on
book
learning
from
their
own
consciousness
of
not
possessing
it
on
the
contrary
he
would
often
remark
that
as
he
felt
the
want
of
a
liberal
education
himself
he
was
determined
to
bestow
one
on
me
i
was
accordingly
at
an
early
age
put
to
a
grammar
school
of
good
repute
in
my
native
village
the
master
of
which
i
believe
is
now
a
member
of
congress
and
at
the
age
of
seventeen
was
sent
to
princeton
to
prepare
myself
for
some
profession
during
my
third
year
at
that
place
in
one
of
my
excursions
to
philadelphia
and
for
which
i
was
always
inventing
pretexts
i
became
acquainted
with
one
of
those
faces
and
forms
which
in
a
youth
of
twenty
to
see
admire
and
love
is
one
and
the
same
thing
my
attentions
were
favourably
received
i
soon
became
desperately
in
love
and
in
spite
of
the
advice
of
my
father
and
entreaties
of
my
mother
who
had
formed
other
schemes
for
me
nearer
home
i
was
married
on
the
anniversary
of
my
year
it
was
not
until
the
first
trance
of
bliss
was
over
that
i
began
to
think
seriously
on
the
course
of
life
i
was
to
pursue
from
the
time
that
my
mind
had
run
on
love
and
matrimony
i
had
lost
all
relish
for
serious
study
and
long
before
that
time
i
had
felt
a
sentiment
bordering
on
contempt
for
the
pursuits
of
my
father
besides
he
had
already
taken
my
two
younger
brothers
into
the
with
him
i
therefore
prevailed
on
my
indulgent
parent
with
the
aid
of
my

intercession
to
purchase
for
me
a
neat
near
huntingdon
which
presented
a
beautiful
view
of
the
sound
and
where
surrounded
by
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
i
promised
myself
to
realise
with
my
susanna
that
life
of
tranquil
felicity
which
fancy
warmed
by
love
so
vividly
depicts
if
we
did
not
meet
with
all
that
we
had
expected
it
was
because
we
had
expected
too
much
the
happiest
life
like
the
purest
atmosphere
has
its
clouds
as
well
as
its
sunshine
and
what
is
worse
we
never
fully
know
the
value
of
the
one
until
we
have
felt
the
inconvenience
of
the
other
in
the
cultivation
of
my
farm
in
educating
our
children
a
son
and
two
daughters
in
reading
music
painting
and
in
occasional
visits
to
our
friends
in
and
philadelphia
seventeen
years
glided
swiftly
and
imperceptibly
away
at
the
end
of
which
time
death
in
depriving
me
of
an
excellent
wife
made
a
wreck
of
my
hopes
and
enjoyments
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
that
relief
to
my
feelings
which
change
of
place
only
could
afford
i
determined
to
make
a
sea
voyage
and
as
one
of
my
father
vessels
was
about
to
sail
for
canton
i
accordingly
embarked
on
board
the
ship
the
captain
thomas
and
left
on
the
day
of
june
having
first
placed
my
three
children
under
the
care
of
my
brother
william
i
will
not
detain
the
reader
with
a
detail
of
the
first
incidents
of
our
voyage
though
they
were
sufficiently
interesting
at
the
time
they
occurred
and
were
not
wanting
in
the
usual
variety
we
had
in
singular
succession
dead
calms
and
fresh
breezes
stiff
gales
and
sudden
squalls
saw
sharks
and
dolphins
spoke
several
vessels
had
a
visit
from
neptune
when
we
crossed
the
line
and
were
compelled
to
propitiate
his
favour
with
some
gallons
of
spirits
which
he
seems
always
to
find
a
very
agreeable
change
from
sea
water
and
touched
at
table
bay
and
at
madagascar
on
the
whole
our
voyage
was
comparatively
pleasant
and
prosperous
until
the
of
october
when
off
the
mouths
of
the
ganges
after
a
fine
clear
autumnal
day
just
about
sunset
a
small
dark
speck
was
seen
in
the
eastern
horizon
by
our
experienced
and
watchful
captain
who
after
noticing
it
for
a
few
moments
pronounced
that
we
should
have
a
hurricane
the
rapidity
with
which
this
speck
grew
into
a
dense
cloud
and
spread
itself
in
darkness
over
the
heavens
as
well
as
the
increasing
swell
of
the
ocean
before
we
felt
the
wind
soon
convinced
us
he
was
right
no
time
was
lost
in
lowering
our
topmasts
taking
double
reefs
and
making
every
thing
snug
to
meet
the
fury
of
the
tempest
i
thought
i
had
already
witnessed
all
that
was
terrific
on
the
ocean
but
what
i
had
formerly
seen
had
been
mere
child
play
compared
with
this
never
can
i
forget
the
impression
that
was
made
upon
me
by
the
wild
uproar
of
the
elements
the
smooth
long
swell
of
the
waves
gradually
changed
into
an
agitated
frothy
surface
which
constant
flashes
of
lightning
presented
to
us
in
all
its
horror
and
in
the
mean
time
the
wind
whistled
through
the
rigging
and
the
ship
creaked
as
if
she
was
every
minute
going
to
pieces
about
midnight
the
storm
was
at
its
height
and
i
gave
up
all
for
lost
the
wind
which
first
blew
from
the
was
then
due
south
and
the
sailors
said
it
began
to
abate
a
little
before
day
but
i
saw
no
great
difference
until
about
three
in
the
afternoon
soon
after
which
the
clouds
broke
away
and
showed
us
the
sun
setting
in
cloudless
majesty
while
the
billows
still
continued
their
stupendous
rolling
but
with
a
heavy
movement
as
if
after
such
mighty
efforts
they
were
seeking
repose
in
the
bosom
of
their
parent
ocean
it
soon
became
almost
calm
a
light
western
breeze
barely
swelled
our
sails
and
gently
wafted
us
to
the
land
which
we
could
faintly
discern
to
the
our
ship
had
been
so
shaken
in
the
tempest
and
was
so
leaky
that
captain
thomas
thought
it
prudent
to
make
for
the
first
port
we
could
reach
at
dawn
we
found
ourselves
in
full
view
of
a
coast
which
though
not
personally
known
to
the
captain
he
pronounced
by
his
charts
to
be
a
part
of
the
burmese
empire
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mergui
on
the
martaban
coast
the
leak
had
now
increased
to
an
alarming
extent
so
that
we
found
it
would
be
impossible
to
carry
the
ship
safe
into
port
we
therefore
hastily
threw
our
clothes
papers
and
eight
casks
of
silver
into
the
and
before
we
were
fifty
yards
from
the
ship
we
saw
her
go
down
some
of
the
underwriters
in
new
york
as
i
have
since
learnt
had
the
conscience
to
contend
that
we
left
the
ship
sooner
than
was
necessary
and
have
suffered
themselves
to
be
sued
for
the
sums
they
had
severally
insured
it
was
a
little
after
midday
when
we
reached
the
town
which
is
perched
on
a
high
bluff
overlooking
the
coasts
and
contains
about
a
thousand
houses
built
of
bamboo
and
covered
with
palm
leaves
our
dress
appearance
language
and
the
manner
of
our
arrival
excited
great
surprise
among
the
natives
and
the
liveliest
curiosity
but
with
these
sentiments
some
evidently
mingled
no
very
friendly
feelings
the
burmese
were
then
on
the
eve
of
a
rupture
with
the
east
india
company
a
fact
which
we
had
not
before
known
and
mistaking
us
for
english
they
supposed
or
affected
to
suppose
that
we
belonged
to
a
fleet
which
was
about
to
invade
them
and
that
our
ship
had
been
sunk
before
their
eyes
by
the
tutelar
divinity
of
the
country
we
were
immediately
carried
before
their
governor
or
chief
magistrate
who
ordered
our
baggage
to
be
searched
and
finding
that
it
consisted
principally
of
silver
he
had
no
doubt
of
our
hostile
intentions
he
therefore
sent
all
of
us
in
number
to
prison
separating
however
each
one
from
the
rest
my
companions
were
released
the
following
spring
as
i
have
since
learnt
by
the
invading
army
of
great
britain
but
it
was
my
ill
fortune
if
indeed
after
what
has
since
happened
i
can
so
regard
it
to
be
taken
for
an
officer
of
high
rank
and
to
be
sent
the
third
day
afterwards
far
into
the
interior
that
i
might
be
more
safely
kept
and
either
used
as
a
hostage
or
offered
for
ransom
as
circumstances
should
render
advantageous
the
reader
is
no
doubt
aware
that
the
burman
empire
lies
beyond
the
ganges
between
the
british
possessions
and
the
kingdom
of
siam
and
that
the
natives
nearly
assimilate
with
those
of
hindostan
in
language
manners
religion
and
character
except
that
they
are
more
hardy
and
warlike
i
was
transported
very
rapidly
in
a
palanquin
a
sort
of
decorated
litter
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
four
men
who
for
greater
despatch
were
changed
every
three
hours
in
this
way
i
travelled
thirteen
days
in
which
time
we
reached
a
little
village
in
the
mountainous
district
between
the
irawaddi
and
saloon
rivers
where
i
was
placed
under
the
care
of
an
inferior
magistrate
called
a
mirvoon
who
there
exercised
the
chief
authority
this
place
named
mozaun
was
romantically
situated
in
a
fertile
valley
that
seemed
to
be
completely
shut
in
by
the
mountains
a
small
river
a
branch
of
the
saloon
entered
it
from
the
west
and
after
running
about
four
miles
in
nearly
a
straight
direction
turned
suddenly
round
a
steep
hill
to
the
south
and
was
entirely
lost
to
view
the
village
was
near
a
gap
in
the
mountain
through
which
the
river
seemed
to
have
forced
its
way
and
consisted
of
about
forty
or
fifty
huts
built
of
the
bamboo
cane
and
reeds
the
house
of
my
landlord
was
somewhat
larger
and
better
than
the
rest
it
stood
on
a
little
knoll
that
overlooked
the
village
the
valley
the
stream
that
ran
through
it
and
commanded
a
distant
view
of
the
country
beyond
the
gap
it
was
certainly
a
lovely
little
spot
as
it
now
appears
to
my
imagination
but
when
the
landscape
was
new
to
me
i
was
in
no
humour
to
relish
its
beauties
and
when
my
mind
was
more
in
a
state
to
appreciate
them
they
had
lost
their
novelty
my
keeper
whose
name
was
sing
fou
and
who
from
a
long
exercise
of
magisterial
authority
was
rough
and
dictatorial
behaved
to
me
somewhat
harshly
at
first
but
my
patient
submission
so
won
his
confidence
and
good
will
that
i
soon
became
a
great
favourite
was
regarded
more
as
one
of
his
family
than
as
a
prisoner
and
was
allowed
by
him
every
indulgence
consistent
with
my
safe
custody
but
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
my
escape
were
so
great
that
little
restraint
was
imposed
on
my
motions
the
narrow
defile
in
the
gap
through
which
the
river
rushed
like
a
torrent
was
closed
with
a
gate
the
mountains
by
which
the
valley
was
hemmed
in
were
utterly
impassable
thickly
set
as
they
were
with
jungle
consisting
of
tangled
brier
thorn
and
forest
trees
of
which
those
who
have
never
been
in
a
tropical
climate
can
form
no
adequate
idea
in
some
places
it
would
be
difficult
to
penetrate
more
than
a
mile
in
the
day
during
which
time
the
traveller
would
be
perpetually
tormented
by
noxious
insects
and
in
constant
dread
of
beasts
of
prey
the
only
outlet
from
this
village
was
by
passing
down
the
valley
along
the
settlements
and
following
the
course
of
the
stream
so
that
there
was
no
other
injunction
laid
on
me
than
not
to
extend
my
rambles
far
in
that
direction
sing
fou
household
consisted
of
his
wife
whom
i
rarely
saw
four
small
children
and
six
servants
and
here
i
enjoyed
nearly
as
great
a
portion
of
happiness
as
in
any
part
of
my
life
it
had
been
one
of
my
favourite
amusements
to
ramble
towards
a
part
of
the
western
ridge
which
rose
in
a
cone
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
village
and
there
ascending
to
some
comparatively
level
spot
or
point
projecting
from
its
side
enjoy
the
beautiful
scenery
which
lay
before
me
and
the
evening
breeze
which
has
such
a
delicious
freshness
in
a
tropical
climate
nor
was
this
all
in
a
deep
sequestered
nook
formed
by
two
spurs
of
this
mountain
there
lived
a
venerable
hindoo
whom
the
people
of
the
village
called
the
holy
hermit
the
favourable
accounts
i
received
of
his
character
as
well
as
his
odd
course
of
life
made
me
very
desirous
of
becoming
acquainted
with
him
and
as
he
was
often
visited
by
the
villagers
i
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
conductor
to
his
cell
his
character
for
sanctity
together
with
a
venerable
beard
might
have
discouraged
advances
towards
an
acquaintance
if
his
lively
piercing
eye
a
countenance
expressive
of
great
mildness
and
kindness
of
disposition
and
his
courteous
manners
had
not
yet
more
strongly
invited
it
he
was
indeed
not
averse
to
society
though
he
had
seemed
thus
to
fly
from
it
and
was
so
great
a
favourite
with
his
neighbours
that
his
cell
would
have
been
thronged
with
visitors
but
for
the
difficulty
of
the
approach
to
it
as
it
was
it
was
seldom
resorted
to
except
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
his
opinion
and
counsel
on
all
the
serious
concerns
of
his
neighbours
he
prescribed
for
the
sick
and
often
provided
the
medicine
they
required
expounded
the
law
adjusted
disputes
made
all
their
little
arithmetical
calculations
gave
them
moral
instruction
and
when
he
could
not
afford
them
relief
in
their
difficulties
he
taught
them
patience
and
gave
them
consolation
he
in
short
united
for
the
simple
people
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
the
functions
of
lawyer
physician
schoolmaster
and
divine
and
richly
merited
the
reverential
respect
in
which
they
held
him
as
well
as
their
little
presents
of
eggs
fruit
and
garden
stuff
from
the
first
evening
that
i
joined
the
party
which
i
saw
clambering
up
the
path
that
led
to
the
hermit
cell
i
found
myself
strongly
attached
to
this
venerable
man
and
the
more
so
from
the
mystery
which
hung
around
his
history
it
was
agreed
that
he
was
not
a
burmese
none
deemed
to
know
certainly
where
he
was
born
or
why
he
came
thither
his
own
account
was
that
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
service
of
god
and
in
his
pilgrimage
over
the
east
had
selected
this
as
a
spot
particularly
favourable
to
the
life
of
quiet
and
seclusion
he
wished
to
lead
there
was
one
part
of
his
story
to
which
i
could
scarcely
give
credit
it
was
said
that
in
the
twelve
or
fifteen
years
he
had
resided
in
this
place
he
had
been
occasionally
invisible
for
months
together
and
no
one
could
tell
why
he
disappeared
or
whither
he
had
gone
at
these
times
his
cell
was
closed
and
although
none
ventured
to
force
their
way
into
it
those
who
were
the
most
prying
could
hear
no
sound
indicating
that
he
was
within
various
were
the
conjectures
formed
on
the
subject
some
supposed
that
he
withdrew
from
the
sight
of
men
for
the
purpose
of
more
fervent
prayer
and
more
holy
meditation
others
that
he
visited
his
home
or
some
other
distant
country
the
more
superstitious
believed
that
he
had
by
a
kind
of
metempsychosis
taken
a
new
shape
which
by
some
magical
or
supernatural
power
he
could
assume
and
put
off
at
pleasure
this
opinion
was
perhaps
the
most
prevalent
as
it
gained
a
colour
with
these
simple
people
from
the
chemical
and
astronomical
instruments
he
possessed
in
these
he
evidently
took
great
pleasure
and
by
their
means
he
acquired
some
of
the
knowledge
by
which
he
so
often
excited
their
admiration
he
soon
distinguished
me
from
the
rest
of
his
visitors
by
addressing
questions
to
me
relative
to
my
history
and
adventures
and
i
in
turn
was
gratified
to
have
met
with
one
who
took
an
interest
in
my
concerns
and
who
alone
of
all
i
had
here
met
with
could
either
enter
into
my
feelings
or
comprehend
my
opinions
our
conversations
were
carried
on
in
english
which
he
spoke
with
facility
and
correctness
we
soon
found
ourselves
so
much
to
each
other
taste
that
there
was
seldom
an
evening
that
i
did
not
make
him
a
visit
and
pass
an
hour
or
two
in
his
company
i
learnt
from
him
that
he
was
born
and
bred
at
benares
in
hindostan
that
he
had
been
intended
for
the
priesthood
and
had
been
well
instructed
in
the
literature
of
the
east
that
a
course
of
untoward
circumstances
upon
which
he
seemed
unwilling
to
dwell
had
changed
his
destination
and
made
him
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
in
the
neighbouring
kingdom
of
siam
he
had
formed
an
intimacy
with
a
learned
french
jesuit
who
had
not
only
taught
him
his
language
but
imparted
to
him
a
knowledge
of
much
of
the
science
of
europe
its
institutions
and
manners
that
after
the
death
of
this
friend
he
had
renewed
his
wanderings
and
having
been
detained
in
this
village
by
a
fit
of
sickness
for
some
weeks
he
was
warned
that
it
was
time
to
quit
his
rambling
life
this
place
being
recommended
to
him
both
by
its
quiet
seclusion
and
the
unsophisticated
manners
of
its
inhabitants
he
determined
to
pass
the
remnant
of
his
days
here
and
by
devoting
them
to
the
purposes
of
piety
charity
and
science
to
discharge
his
duty
to
his
creator
his
species
and
himself
for
the
love
of
knowledge
he
added
has
long
been
my
chief
source
of
selfish
enjoyment
our
tastes
and
sentiments
accorded
in
so
many
points
that
our
acquaintance
ripened
by
degrees
into
the
closest
friendship
we
were
both
strangers
both
unfortunate
and
were
the
only
individuals
here
who
had
any
knowledge
of
letters
or
of
distant
parts
of
the
world
these
are
indeed
the
main
springs
of
that
sympathy
without
which
there
is
no
love
among
men
it
is
being
overwise
to
treat
with
contempt
what
mankind
hold
in
respect
and
philosophy
teaches
us
not
to
extinguish
our
feelings
but
to
correct
and
refine
them
my
visits
to
the
hermitage
were
frequently
renewed
at
first
because
they
afforded
me
the
relief
of
variety
whilst
his
intimate
knowledge
of
men
and
things
his
remarkable
sagacity
and
good
sense
his
air
of
mingled
piety
and
benignity
cheated
me
into
forgetfulness
of
my
situation
as
these
gradually
yielded
to
the
lenitive
power
of
time
i
sought
his
conversation
for
the
positive
pleasure
it
afforded
and
at
last
it
became
the
chief
source
of
my
happiness
day
after
day
and
month
after
month
glided
on
in
this
gentle
unvarying
current
for
more
than
three
years
during
which
period
he
had
occasionally
thrown
out
dark
hints
that
the
time
would
come
when
i
should
be
restored
to
liberty
and
that
he
had
an
important
secret
which
he
would
one
day
communicate
i
should
have
been
more
tantalized
with
the
expectations
that
these
remarks
were
calculated
to
raise
had
i
not
suspected
them
to
be
a
artifice
to
save
me
from
despondency
as
they
were
never
made
except
when
he
saw
me
looking
serious
and
thoughtful
chapter
ii
brahmin
illness
he
reveals
an
important
secret
to
atterley
curious
information
concerning
the
moon
the
glonglims
they
plan
a
voyage
to
the
about
this
period
one
afternoon
in
the
month
of
march
when
i
repaired
to
the
hermitage
as
usual
i
found
my
venerable
friend
stretched
on
his
humble
pallet
breathing
very
quickly
and
seemingly
in
great
pain
he
was
labouring
under
a
pleurisy
which
is
not
unfrequent
in
the
mountainous
region
at
this
season
he
told
me
that
his
disease
had
not
yielded
to
the
ordinary
remedies
which
he
had
tried
when
he
first
felt
its
approach
and
that
he
considered
himself
to
be
dangerously
i
am
however
he
added
prepared
to
die
sit
down
on
that
block
and
listen
to
what
i
shall
say
to
you
though
i
shall
quit
this
state
of
being
for
another
and
a
better
i
confess
that
i
was
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
expiring
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
you
i
am
the
depository
of
a
secret
that
i
believe
is
known
to
no
other
living
mortal
i
once
determined
that
it
should
die
with
me
and
had
i
not
met
with
you
it
certainly
should
but
from
our
first
acquaintance
my
heart
has
been
strongly
attracted
towards
you
and
as
soon
as
i
found
you
possessed
of
qualities
to
inspire
esteem
as
well
as
regard
i
felt
disposed
to
give
you
this
proof
of
my
confidence
still
i
hesitated
i
first
wished
to
deliberate
on
the
probable
effects
of
my
disclosure
upon
the
condition
of
society
i
saw
that
it
might
produce
evil
as
well
as
good
but
on
weighing
the
two
together
i
have
satisfied
myself
that
the
good
will
preponderate
and
have
determined
to
act
accordingly
take
this
key
stretching
out
his
feverish
hand
and
after
waiting
two
hours
in
which
time
the
medicine
i
have
taken
will
have
either
produced
a
good
effect
or
put
an
end
to
my
sufferings
you
may
then
open
that
blue
chest
in
the
corner
it
has
a
false
bottom
on
removing
the
paper
which
covers
it
you
will
find
the
manuscript
containing
the
important
secret
together
with
some
gold
pieces
which
i
have
saved
for
the
day
of
need
because
and
he
smiled
in
spite
of
his
sufferings
because
hoarding
is
one
of
the
pleasures
of
old
men
take
them
both
and
use
them
discreetly
when
i
am
gone
i
request
you
my
friend
to
discharge
the
last
sad
duties
of
humanity
and
to
see
me
buried
according
to
the
usages
of
my
caste
the
simple
beings
around
me
will
then
behold
that
i
am
mortal
like
themselves
and
let
this
precious
relic
of
female
loveliness
and
worth
taking
a
small
picture
set
in
gold
from
his
bosom
be
buried
with
me
it
has
been
warmed
by
my
heart
blood
for
years
let
it
be
still
near
that
heart
when
it
ceases
to
beat
i
have
yet
more
to
say
to
you
but
my
strength
is
too
much
exhausted
the
good
old
man
here
closed
his
eyes
with
an
expression
of
patient
resignation
and
rather
as
if
he
courted
sleep
than
felt
inclined
to
it
and
after
shutting
the
door
of
his
cell
i
repaired
to
his
little
garden
to
pass
the
allotted
two
hours
left
to
my
meditations
when
i
thought
that
i
was
probably
about
to
be
deprived
for
ever
of
the
hermit
conversation
and
society
i
felt
the
wretchedness
of
my
situation
recur
with
all
its
former
force
i
sat
down
on
a
smooth
rock
under
a
tamarind
tree
the
scene
of
many
an
interesting
conference
between
the
brahmin
and
myself
and
i
cast
my
eyes
around
but
how
changed
was
every
thing
before
me
i
no
longer
regarded
the
sparkling
eddies
of
the
little
cascade
which
fell
down
a
steep
rock
at
the
upper
end
of
the
garden
and
formed
a
pellucid
basin
below
the
gay
flowers
and
rich
foliage
of
this
genial
climate
the
bright
plumage
and
cheerful
notes
of
the
birds
were
all
there
but
my
mind
was
not
in
a
state
to
relish
them
i
arose
and
in
extreme
agitation
rambled
over
this
little
eden
in
which
i
had
passed
so
many
delightful
hours
before
the
allotted
time
had
elapsed
shall
i
confess
it
my
fears
for
the
hermit
were
overcome
by
those
that
were
purely
selfish
it
occurred
to
me
if
he
should
thus
suddenly
die
and
i
be
found
alone
in
his
cell
i
might
be
charged
with
being
his
murderer
and
my
courage
which
from
long
inaction
had
sadly
declined
of
late
deserted
me
at
the
thought
after
the
most
torturing
suspense
the
dial
at
length
showed
me
that
the
two
hours
had
elapsed
and
i
hastened
to
the
cell
i
paused
a
moment
at
the
door
afraid
to
enter
or
even
look
in
made
one
or
two
steps
and
hearing
no
sound
concluded
that
all
was
over
with
the
hermit
and
that
my
own
doom
was
sealed
my
delight
was
inexpressible
therefore
when
i
perceived
that
he
still
breathed
and
when
on
drawing
nearer
i
found
that
he
slept
soundly
in
a
moment
i
passed
from
misery
to
bliss
i
seated
myself
by
his
side
and
there
remained
for
more
than
an
hour
enjoying
the
transition
of
my
feelings
at
length
he
awoke
and
casting
on
me
a
look
of
placid
benignity
said
atterley
my
time
is
not
yet
come
though
resigned
to
death
i
am
content
to
live
the
worst
is
over
i
am
already
almost
restored
to
health
i
then
administered
to
him
some
refreshments
and
after
a
while
left
him
to
repose
on
again
repairing
to
the
garden
every
object
assumed
its
wonted
appearance
the
fragrance
of
the
orange
and
the
jasmine
was
no
longer
lost
to
me
the
humming
birds
which
swarmed
round
the
flowering
cytisus
and
the
beautiful
once
more
delighted
the
eye
and
the
ear
i
took
my
usual
bath
as
the
sun
was
sinking
below
the
mountain
and
finding
the
hermit
still
soundly
sleeping
i
threw
myself
on
a
seat
under
the
shelter
of
some
bamboos
fell
asleep
and
did
not
awake
until
late
the
next
morning
when
i
arose
i
found
the
good
brahmin
up
and
though
much
weakened
by
his
disease
able
to
walk
about
he
told
me
that
the
mirvoon
uneasy
at
my
not
returning
as
usual
in
the
evening
had
sent
in
search
of
me
and
that
the
servant
finding
me
safe
was
content
to
return
without
me
he
advised
me
however
not
to
repeat
the
same
cause
of
alarm
sing
fou
on
hearing
my
explanation
readily
forgave
me
for
the
uneasiness
i
had
caused
him
after
a
few
days
the
brahmin
recovered
his
ordinary
health
and
strength
and
having
attended
him
at
an
earlier
hour
than
usual
according
to
his
request
on
the
previous
evening
he
thus
addressed
me
i
have
already
told
you
my
dear
atterley
that
i
was
born
and
educated
at
benares
and
that
science
is
there
more
thoroughly
understood
and
taught
than
the
people
of
the
west
are
aware
of
we
have
for
many
thousands
of
years
been
good
astronomers
chymists
mathematicians
and
philosophers
we
had
discovered
the
secret
of
gunpowder
the
magnetic
attraction
the
properties
of
electricity
long
before
they
were
heard
of
in
europe
we
know
more
than
we
have
revealed
and
much
of
our
knowledge
is
deposited
in
the
archives
of
the
caste
to
which
i
belong
but
for
want
of
a
language
generally
understood
and
easily
learnt
for
these
records
are
always
written
in
the
sanscrit
that
is
no
longer
a
spoken
language
and
the
diffusion
which
is
given
by
the
art
of
printing
these
secrets
of
science
are
communicated
only
to
a
few
and
sometimes
even
sleep
with
their
authors
until
a
subsequent
discovery
under
more
favourable
circumstances
brings
them
again
to
light
it
was
at
this
seat
of
science
that
i
learnt
from
one
of
our
sages
the
physical
truth
which
i
am
now
about
to
communicate
and
which
he
discovered
partly
by
his
researches
into
the
writings
of
ancient
pundits
and
partly
by
his
own
extraordinary
sagacity
there
is
a
principle
of
repulsion
as
well
as
gravitation
in
the
earth
it
causes
fire
to
rise
upwards
it
is
exhibited
in
electricity
it
occasions
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
after
much
labour
and
research
this
principle
has
been
found
embodied
in
a
metallic
substance
which
is
met
with
in
the
mountain
in
which
we
are
united
with
a
very
heavy
earth
and
this
circumstance
had
great
influence
in
inducing
me
to
settle
myself
here
this
metal
when
separated
and
purified
has
as
great
a
tendency
to
fly
off
from
the
earth
as
a
piece
of
gold
or
lead
has
to
approach
it
after
making
a
number
of
curious
experiments
with
it
we
bethought
ourselves
of
putting
it
to
some
use
and
soon
contrived
with
the
aid
of
it
to
make
cars
and
ascend
into
the
air
we
were
very
secret
in
these
operations
for
our
unhappy
country
having
then
recently
fallen
under
the
subjection
of
the
british
nation
we
apprehended
that
if
we
divulged
our
arcanum
they
would
not
only
fly
away
with
all
our
treasures
whether
found
in
palace
or
pagoda
but
also
carry
off
the
inhabitants
to
make
them
slaves
in
their
colonies
as
their
government
had
not
then
abolished
the
african
slave
trade
after
various
trials
and
many
successive
improvements
in
which
our
desires
increased
with
our
success
we
determined
to
penetrate
the
aerial
void
as
far
as
we
could
providing
for
that
purpose
an
apparatus
with
which
you
will
become
better
acquainted
hereafter
in
the
course
of
our
experiments
we
discovered
that
this
same
metal
which
was
repelled
from
the
earth
was
in
the
same
degree
attracted
towards
the
moon
for
in
one
of
our
excursions
still
aiming
to
ascend
higher
than
we
had
ever
done
before
we
were
actually
carried
to
that
satellite
and
if
we
had
not
there
fallen
into
a
lake
and
our
machine
had
not
been
we
must
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
or
drowned
you
will
find
in
this
book
he
added
presenting
me
with
a
small
volume
bound
in
green
parchment
and
fastened
with
silver
clasps
a
minute
detail
of
the
apparatus
to
be
provided
and
the
directions
to
be
pursued
in
making
this
wonderful
voyage
i
have
written
it
since
i
satisfied
my
mind
that
my
fears
of
british
rapacity
were
unfounded
and
that
i
should
do
more
good
than
harm
by
publishing
the
secret
but
still
i
am
not
sure
he
added
with
one
of
his
faint
but
significant
smiles
that
i
am
not
actuated
by
a
wish
to
immortalize
my
name
for
where
is
the
mortal
who
would
be
indifferent
to
this
object
if
he
thought
he
could
attain
it
read
the
book
at
your
leisure
and
study
it
i
listened
to
this
recital
with
astonishment
and
doubted
at
first
whether
the
brahmin
late
severe
attack
had
not
had
the
effect
of
unsettling
his
brain
but
on
looking
in
his
face
the
calm
and
intelligence
which
it
exhibited
dispelled
the
momentary
impression
i
was
all
impatience
to
know
the
adventures
he
met
with
in
the
moon
asking
him
fifty
questions
in
a
breath
but
was
most
anxious
to
learn
if
it
had
inhabitants
and
what
sort
of
beings
they
were
yes
said
he
the
moon
has
inhabitants
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
earth
of
which
they
believe
their
globe
to
have
been
formerly
a
part
but
suspend
your
questions
and
let
me
give
you
a
recital
of
the
most
remarkable
things
i
saw
there
i
checked
my
impatience
and
listened
with
all
my
ears
to
the
wonders
he
related
he
went
on
to
inform
me
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
resembled
those
of
the
earth
in
form
stature
features
and
manners
and
were
evidently
of
the
same
species
as
they
did
not
differ
more
than
did
the
hottentot
from
the
parisian
that
they
had
similar
passions
propensities
and
pursuits
but
differed
greatly
in
manners
and
habits
they
had
more
activity
but
less
strength
they
were
feebler
in
mind
as
well
as
body
but
the
most
curious
part
of
his
information
was
that
a
large
number
of
them
were
born
without
any
intellectual
vigour
and
wandered
about
as
so
many
automatons
under
the
care
of
the
government
until
they
were
illuminated
with
the
mental
ray
from
some
earthly
brains
by
means
of
the
mysterious
influence
which
the
moon
is
known
to
exercise
on
our
planet
but
in
this
case
the
inhabitant
of
the
earth
loses
what
the
inhabitant
of
the
moon
gains
the
ordinary
portion
of
understanding
allotted
to
one
mortal
being
thus
divided
between
two
and
as
might
be
expected
seeing
that
the
two
minds
were
originally
the
same
there
is
a
most
exact
conformity
between
the
man
of
the
earth
and
his
counterpart
in
the
moon
in
all
their
principles
of
action
and
modes
of
thinking
these
glonglims
as
they
are
called
after
they
have
been
thus
imbued
with
intellect
are
held
in
peculiar
respect
by
the
vulgar
and
are
thought
to
be
in
every
way
superior
to
those
whose
understandings
are
entire
the
laws
by
which
two
objects
so
far
apart
operate
on
each
other
have
been
as
yet
but
imperfectly
developed
and
the
wilder
their
freaks
the
more
they
are
the
objects
of
wonder
and
admiration
the
science
of
he
observed
is
yet
in
its
infancy
but
in
the
three
voyages
i
have
made
to
the
moon
i
have
acquired
so
many
new
facts
and
imparted
so
many
to
the
learned
men
of
that
planet
that
it
is
without
doubt
the
subject
of
their
active
speculations
at
this
time
and
will
probably
assume
a
regular
form
long
before
the
new
science
of
phrenology
of
which
you
tell
me
and
which
it
must
in
time
supersede
now
and
then
though
very
rarely
the
man
of
the
earth
regains
the
intellect
he
has
lost
in
which
case
his
lunar
counterpart
returns
to
his
former
state
of
imbecility
both
parties
are
entirely
unconscious
of
the
change
one
of
what
he
has
lost
and
the
other
of
what
he
has
gained
the
brahmin
then
added
though
our
party
are
the
only
voyagers
of
which
authentic
history
affords
any
testimony
yet
it
is
probable
from
obscure
hints
in
some
of
our
most
ancient
writings
in
the
sanscrit
that
the
voyage
has
been
made
in
remote
periods
of
antiquity
and
the
lunarians
have
a
similar
tradition
while
in
the
revolutions
which
have
so
changed
the
affairs
of
mankind
on
our
globe
and
probably
in
its
satellite
the
art
has
been
lost
faint
traces
of
its
existence
may
be
perceived
in
the
opinions
of
the
vulgar
and
in
many
of
their
ordinary
forms
of
expression
thus
it
is
generally
believed
throughout
all
asia
that
the
moon
has
an
influence
on
the
brain
and
when
a
man
is
of
insane
mind
we
call
him
a
lunatic
one
of
the
curses
of
the
common
people
is
the
moon
eat
up
your
brains
and
in
china
they
say
of
a
man
who
has
done
any
act
of
egregious
folly
was
gathering
wool
in
the
moon
i
was
struck
with
these
remarks
and
told
the
hermit
that
the
language
of
europe
afforded
the
same
indirect
evidence
of
the
fact
he
mentioned
that
my
own
language
especially
abounded
with
expressions
which
could
be
explained
on
no
other
hypothesis
for
besides
the
terms
lunacy
lunatic
and
the
supposed
influence
of
the
moon
on
the
brain
when
we
see
symptoms
of
a
disordered
intellect
we
say
the
mind
which
evidently
alludes
to
a
part
of
it
rambling
to
a
distant
region
as
is
the
moon
we
say
too
a
man
is
of
his
that
is
his
mind
being
in
another
man
head
must
of
course
be
out
of
his
own
to
know
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
is
a
proverbial
expression
for
ignorance
and
is
without
meaning
unless
it
be
considered
to
refer
to
the
glonglims
we
say
that
an
insane
man
is
distracted
by
which
we
mean
that
his
mind
is
drawn
two
different
ways
so
also
we
call
a
lunatic
man
beside
which
most
distinctly
expresses
the
two
distinct
bodies
his
mind
now
animates
there
are
moreover
many
other
analogous
expressions
as
moonstruck
deranged
extravagant
and
some
others
which
altogether
form
a
mass
of
concurring
testimony
that
it
is
impossible
to
resist
be
that
as
it
may
said
he
whether
the
voyage
has
been
made
in
former
times
or
not
is
of
little
importance
it
is
sufficient
for
us
to
know
that
it
has
been
effected
in
our
time
and
can
be
effected
again
i
am
anxious
to
repeat
the
voyage
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
some
facts
about
which
i
have
been
lately
speculating
and
i
wish
besides
to
afford
you
ocular
demonstration
of
the
wonders
i
have
disclosed
for
in
spite
of
your
good
opinion
of
my
veracity
i
have
sometimes
perceived
symptoms
of
incredulity
about
you
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
the
love
of
the
marvellous
and
the
wish
for
a
change
which
had
long
slumbered
in
my
bosom
were
now
suddenly
awakened
and
i
eagerly
caught
at
his
proposal
when
can
we
set
out
father
said
i
not
so
fast
replied
he
we
have
a
great
deal
of
preparation
to
make
our
apparatus
requires
the
best
workmanship
and
we
can
not
here
command
either
articles
or
materials
without
incurring
the
risk
of
suspicion
and
interruption
while
most
of
the
simple
villagers
are
kindly
disposed
towards
me
there
are
a
few
who
regard
me
with
distrust
and
malevolence
and
would
readily
avail
themselves
of
an
opportunity
to
bring
me
under
the
censure
of
the
priesthood
and
the
government
besides
the
governor
of
mergui
would
probably
be
glad
to
lay
hold
of
any
plausible
evidence
against
you
as
affording
him
the
best
chance
of
avoiding
any
future
reckoning
either
with
you
or
his
superiors
we
must
therefore
be
very
secret
in
our
plans
i
know
an
ingenious
artificer
in
copper
and
other
metals
whose
only
child
i
was
instrumental
in
curing
of
scrofula
and
in
whose
fidelity
as
well
as
good
will
i
can
safely
rely
but
we
must
give
him
time
he
can
construct
our
machine
at
home
and
we
must
take
our
departure
from
that
place

national
having
thus
formed
our
plan
of
operations
we
the
next
day
proceeded
to
put
them
in
execution
the
coppersmith
agreed
to
undertake
the
work
we
wanted
done
for
a
moderate
compensation
but
we
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
inform
him
of
our
object
which
he
supposed
was
to
make
some
philosophical
experiment
it
was
forthwith
arranged
that
he
should
occasionally
visit
the
hermit
to
receive
instructions
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
asking
medical
advice
during
this
interval
my
mind
was
absorbed
with
our
project
and
when
in
company
i
was
so
thoughtful
and
abstracted
that
it
has
since
seemed
strange
to
me
that
sing
suspicions
that
i
was
planning
my
escape
were
not
more
excited
at
length
by
dint
of
great
exertion
in
about
three
months
every
thing
was
in
readiness
and
we
determined
on
the
following
night
to
set
out
on
our
perilous
expedition
the
machine
in
which
we
proposed
to
embark
was
a
copper
vessel
that
would
have
been
an
exact
cube
of
six
feet
if
the
corners
and
edges
had
not
been
rounded
off
it
had
an
opening
large
enough
to
receive
our
bodies
which
was
closed
by
double
sliding
pannels
with
quilted
cloth
between
them
when
these
were
properly
adjusted
the
machine
was
perfectly
and
strong
enough
by
means
of
iron
bars
running
alternately
inside
and
out
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
when
the
machine
should
be
exhausted
of
its
air
as
we
took
the
precaution
to
prove
by
the
aid
of
an
on
the
top
of
the
copper
chest
and
on
the
outside
we
had
as
much
of
the
lunar
metal
which
i
shall
henceforth
call
as
we
found
by
calculation
and
experiment
would
overcome
the
weight
of
the
machine
as
well
as
its
contents
and
take
us
to
the
moon
on
the
third
day
as
the
air
which
the
machine
contained
would
not
be
sufficient
for
our
respiration
more
than
about
six
hours
and
the
chief
part
of
the
space
we
were
to
pass
through
was
a
mere
void
we
provided
ourselves
with
a
sufficient
supply
by
condensing
it
in
a
small
globular
vessel
made
partly
of
iron
and
partly
of
lunarium
to
take
off
its
weight
on
my
return
i
gave
jacob
perkins
who
is
now
in
england
a
hint
of
this
plan
of
condensation
and
it
has
there
obtained
him
great
celebrity
this
fact
i
should
not
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
mention
had
he
not
taken
the
sole
merit
of
the
invention
to
himself
at
least
i
can
not
hear
that
in
his
numerous
public
notices
he
has
ever
mentioned
my
name
but
to
return
a
small
circular
window
made
of
a
single
piece
of
thick
clear
glass
was
neatly
fitted
on
each
of
the
six
sides
several
pieces
of
lead
were
securely
fastened
to
screws
which
passed
through
the
bottom
of
the
machine
as
well
as
a
thick
plank
the
screws
were
so
contrived
that
by
turning
them
in
one
direction
the
pieces
of
lead
attached
to
them
were
immediately
disengaged
from
the
hooks
with
which
they
were
connected
the
pieces
of
lunarium
were
fastened
in
like
manner
to
screws
which
passed
through
the
top
of
the
machine
so
that
by
turning
them
in
one
direction
those
metallic
pieces
would
fly
into
the
air
with
the
velocity
of
a
rocket
the
brahmin
took
with
him
a
thermometer
two
telescopes
one
of
which
projected
through
the
top
of
the
machine
and
the
other
through
the
bottom
a
phosphoric
lamp
pen
ink
and
paper
and
some
light
refreshments
sufficient
to
supply
us
for
some
days
the
moon
was
then
in
her
third
quarter
and
near
the
zenith
it
was
of
course
a
little
after
midnight
and
when
the
coppersmith
and
his
family
were
in
their
soundest
sleep
that
we
entered
the
machine
in
about
an
hour
more
we
had
the
doors
secured
and
every
thing
arranged
in
its
place
when
cutting
the
cords
which
fastened
us
to
the
ground
by
means
of
small
steel
blades
which
worked
in
the
ends
of
other
screws
we
rose
from
the
earth
with
a
whizzing
sound
and
a
sensation
at
first
of
very
rapid
ascent
but
after
a
short
time
we
were
scarcely
sensible
of
any
motion
in
the
machine
except
when
we
changed
our
places
the
ardent
curiosity
i
had
felt
to
behold
the
wonderful
things
which
the
brahmin
related
and
the
hope
of
returning
soon
to
my
children
and
native
country
had
made
me
most
impatient
for
the
moment
of
departure
during
which
time
the
hazards
and
difficulties
of
the
voyage
were
entirely
overlooked
but
now
that
the
moment
of
execution
had
arrived
and
i
found
myself
shut
up
in
this
small
chest
and
about
to
enter
on
a
voyage
so
new
so
strange
and
beset
with
such
a
variety
of
dangers
i
will
not
deny
that
my
courage
failed
me
and
i
would
gladly
have
compromised
to
return
to
mozaun
and
remain
there
quietly
all
the
rest
of
my
days
but
shame
restrained
me
and
i
dissembled
my
emotions
at
our
first
shock
on
leaving
the
earth
my
fears
were
at
their
height
but
after
about
two
hours
i
had
tolerably
well
regained
my
composure
to
which
the
returning
light
of
day
greatly
contributed
by
this
time
we
had
a
full
view
of
the
rising
sun
pouring
a
flood
of
light
over
one
half
of
the
circular
landscape
below
us
and
leaving
the
rest
in
shade
while
those
natural
objects
the
rivers
and
mountains
land
and
sea
were
fast
receding
from
our
view
our
horizon
kept
gradually
extending
as
we
mounted
but
ere
this
effect
ceased
and
the
broad
disc
of
the
earth
began
sensibly
to
diminish
it
is
impossible
to
describe
my
sensations
of
mingled
awe
and
admiration
at
the
splendid
spectacle
beneath
me
so
long
as
the
different
portions
of
the
earth
surface
were
plainly
distinguishable
the
novelty
of
the
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
as
well
as
its
danger
prevented
me
indeed
at
first
from
giving
more
than
a
passing
attention
to
the
magnificent
scene
but
after
a
while
encouraged
by
the
brahmin
exhortation
and
yet
more
by
the
example
of
his
calm
and
assured
air
i
was
able
to
take
a
more
leisurely
view
of
it
at
first
as
we
partook
of
the
diurnal
motion
of
the
earth
and
our
course
was
consequently
oblique
the
same
portion
of
the
globe
from
which
we
had
set
out
continued
directly
under
us
and
as
the
eye
stretched
in
every
direction
over
asia
and
its
seas
continents
and
islands
they
appeared
like
pieces
of
green
velvet
the
surrounding
ocean
like
a
mirror
and
the
ganges
the
hoogley
and
the
great
rivers
of
china
like
threads
of
silver
about
it
was
necessary
to
get
a
fresh
supply
of
air
when
my
companion
cautiously
turned
one
of
the
two
to
let
out
that
which
was
no
longer
fit
for
respiration
requesting
me
at
the
same
time
to
turn
the
other
to
let
in
a
fresh
supply
of
condensed
air
but
being
awkward
in
the
first
attempt
to
follow
his
directions
i
was
so
affected
by
the
exhaustion
of
the
air
through
the
vent
now
made
for
it
that
i
fainted
and
having
at
the
same
time
given
freer
passage
to
the
condensed
air
than
i
ought
we
must
in
a
few
seconds
have
lost
our
supply
and
thus
have
inevitably
perished
had
not
the
watchful
hermit
seen
the
mischief
and
repaired
it
almost
as
soon
as
it
occurred
this
accident
and
the
various
agitations
my
mind
had
undergone
in
the
course
of
the
day
so
overpowered
me
that
at
an
early
hour
in
the
afternoon
i
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
and
did
not
awake
again
for
eight
hours
while
i
slept
the
good
brahmin
had
contrived
to
manage
both
himself
the
time
of
my
waking
would
have
been
about
at
night
if
we
had
continued
on
the
earth
but
we
were
now
in
a
region
where
there
was
no
alternation
of
day
and
night
but
one
unvarying
cloudless
sun
its
heat
however
was
not
in
proportion
to
its
brightness
for
we
found
that
after
we
had
ascended
a
few
miles
from
the
earth
it
was
becoming
much
colder
and
the
brahmin
had
recourse
to
a
chemical
process
for
evolving
heat
which
soon
made
us
comfortable
but
after
we
were
fairly
in
the
great
aerial
void
the
temperature
of
our
machine
showed
no
tendency
to
change
the
sensations
caused
by
the
novelty
of
my
situation
at
first
checked
those
lively
and
varied
trains
of
thought
which
the
view
of
so
many
countries
passing
in
review
before
us
was
calculated
to
excite
yet
after
i
had
become
more
familiar
with
it
i
contemplated
the
beautiful
exhibition
with
inexpressible
delight
besides
a
glass
of
cordial
as
well
as
the
calm
confiding
air
of
the
brahmin
contributed
to
restore
me
to
my
the
reader
will
recollect
that
although
our
motion
at
first
partook
of
that
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
and
although
the
effect
was
the
same
on
our
course
the
effect
was
less
and
less
as
we
ascended
and
consequently
that
after
a
certain
height
every
part
of
the
terraqueous
globe
would
present
itself
to
our
view
in
succession
as
we
rapidly
receded
from
it
at
the
whole
of
india
was
a
little
to
the
west
of
us
and
we
saw
as
in
a
map
that
fertile
and
populous
region
which
has
been
so
strangely
reduced
to
subjection
by
a
company
of
merchants
belonging
to
a
country
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
globe
a
country
not
equal
to
of
it
in
extent
or
population
its
rivers
were
like
small
filaments
of
silver
the
red
sea
resembled
a
narrow
plate
of
the
same
metal
the
peninsula
of
india
was
of
a
darker
and
arabia
of
a
light
and
more
grayish
green
the
sun
rays
striking
obliquely
on
the
atlantic
emitted
an
effulgence
that
was
dazzling
to
the
eyes
for
two
or
three
hours
the
appearance
of
the
earth
did
not
greatly
vary
the
wider
extent
of
surface
we
could
survey
compensating
for
our
greater
distance
and
indeed
at
that
time
we
could
not
see
the
whole
horizon
without
putting
our
eyes
close
to
the
glass
when
the
brahmin
saw
that
i
had
overcome
my
first
surprise
and
had
acquired
somewhat
of
his
own
composure
he
manifested
a
disposition
to
beguile
the
time
with
conversation
look
through
the
telescope
said
he
a
little
from
the
sun
and
observe
the
continent
of
africa
which
is
presenting
itself
to
our
view
i
took
a
hasty
glance
over
it
and
perceived
that
its
northern
edge
was
fringed
with
green
then
a
dull
white
belt
marked
the
great
sahara
or
desert
and
then
it
exhibited
a
deep
green
again
to
its
most
southern
extremity
i
tried
in
vain
to
discover
the
pyramids
for
our
telescope
had
not
sufficient
power
to
show
them
i
observed
to
him
that
less
was
known
of
this
continent
than
of
the
others
that
a
spirit
of
lively
curiosity
had
been
excited
by
the
western
nations
of
europe
to
become
acquainted
with
the
inhabited
parts
of
the
globe
but
that
all
the
efforts
yet
made
had
still
left
a
large
portion
almost
entirely
unknown
i
asked
if
he
did
not
think
it
probable
that
some
of
the
nations
in
the
interior
of
africa
were
more
advanced
in
civilization
than
those
on
the
coast
whose
barbarous
custom
of
making
slaves
of
their
prisoners
europeans
had
encouraged
and
perpetuated
by
purchasing
them
no
no
said
he
the
benefits
of
civilization
could
not
have
been
so
easily
confined
but
would
have
spread
themselves
over
every
part
of
that
continent
or
at
least
as
far
as
the
great
desert
if
they
had
ever
existed
the
intense
heat
of
a
climate
lying
on
each
side
of
the
line
at
once
disinclines
men
to
exertion
and
renders
it
unnecessary
vegetable
diet
is
more
suited
to
them
than
animal
which
favours
a
denser
population
talent
is
elicited
by
the
efforts
required
to
overcome
difficulties
and
hardships
and
their
natural
is
a
country
of
frost
and
snow
of
tempests
of
sterility
enough
to
give
a
spur
to
exertion
but
not
enough
to
extinguish
hope
where
these
difficulties
exist
and
give
occasion
to
war
and
emulation
the
powers
of
the
human
mind
are
most
frequently
developed
do
you
think
then
said
i
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
natural
inferiority
and
differences
of
races
i
have
been
much
perplexed
by
that
question
said
he
when
i
regard
the
great
masses
of
mankind
i
think
there
seems
to
be
among
them
some
characteristic
differences
i
see
that
the
europeans
have
every
where
obtained
the
ascendancy
over
those
who
inhabit
the
other
quarters
of
the
globe
but
when
i
compare
individuals
i
see
always
the
same
passions
the
same
motives
the
same
mental
operations
and
my
opinion
is
changed
the
same
seed
becomes
a
very
different
plant
when
sowed
in
one
soil
or
another
and
put
under
this
or
that
mode
of
cultivation
and
may
not
said
i
the
very
nature
of
the
plant
be
changed
after
a
long
continuance
of
the
same
culture
in
the
same
soil
why
that
is
but
another
mode
of
stating
the
question
i
rather
think
if
it
has
generally
degenerated
it
may
by
opposite
treatment
be
also
gradually
brought
back
to
its
original
excellence
who
knows
then
said
i
what
our
missionaries
and
colonization
societies
may
effect
in
africa
he
inquired
of
me
what
these
societies
were
and
on
explaining
their
history
observed
by
what
you
tell
me
it
is
indeed
a
small
beginning
but
if
they
can
get
this
grain
of
to
grow
there
is
no
saying
how
much
it
may
multiply
see
what
a
handful
of
colonists
have
done
in
your
own
country
a
few
of
english
have
overspread
half
a
continent
and
from
what
you
tell
me
their
descendants
will
amount
in
another
century
to
more
than
one
hundred
millions
there
is
no
rule
he
continued
that
can
be
laid
down
on
this
subject
to
which
some
nations
can
not
be
found
to
furnish
a
striking
exception
if
mere
difficulties
were
all
that
were
wanting
to
call
forth
the
intellectual
energies
of
man
they
have
their
full
share
on
the
borders
of
the
great
desert
there
are
in
that
whitish
tract
which
separates
the
countries
on
the
southern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
from
the
rest
of
africa
thousands
of
human
beings
at
this
moment
toiling
over
that
dreary
ocean
of
sand
to
whom
a
draught
of
fresh
water
would
be
a
blessing
and
the
simplest
meal
a
luxury
perhaps
however
you
will
say
they
are
so
engrossed
with
the
animal
wants
of
hunger
and
thirst
that
they
are
incapable
of
attending
to
any
thing
else
be
it
so
but
in
the
interior
they
are
placed
in
parallel
circumstances
with
the
natives
of
europe
they
are
engaged
in
struggles
for
territory
and
dominion
for
their
altars
and
their
homes
and
this
state
of
things
which
has
made
some
of
them
brave
and
warlike
has
made
none
poets
or
painters
historians
or
philosophers
there
poetry
has
not
wanted
themes
of
great
achievement
and
noble
daring
but
heroes
have
wanted
poets
nor
can
we
justly
ascribe
the
difference
to
the
enervating
influence
of
climate
for
the
temperature
of
the
most
southern
parts
of
africa
differs
little
from
that
of
greece
and
the
tropical
nations
too
of
your
own
continent
the
peruvians
were
more
improved
than
those
who
inhabited
the
temperate
regions
besides
though
the
climate
had
instilled
softness
and
feebleness
of
character
it
might
also
have
permitted
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
as
has
been
the
case
with
us
in
asia
on
the
whole
without
our
being
able
to
pronounce
with
certainty
on
the
subject
it
does
seem
probable
that
some
organic
difference
exists
in
the
various
races
of
mankind
to
which
their
diversities
of
moral
and
intellectual
character
may
in
part
be
referred
by
this
time
the
morea
and
the
grecian
archipelago
were
directly
under
our
telescope
does
not
greece
said
i
furnish
the
clearest
proof
of
the
influence
of
moral
causes
on
the
character
of
nations
compare
what
that
country
formerly
was
with
what
it
now
is
once
superior
to
all
the
rest
of
the
habitable
globe
of
which
it
did
not
constitute
the
thousandth
part
in
letters
arts
and
arms
and
all
that
distinguishes
men
from
brutes
not
merely
in
their
own
estimation
for
all
nations
are
disposed
to
rate
themselves
high
enough
but
by
the
general
consent
of
the
rest
of
the
world
do
not
the
most
improved
and
civilized
of
modern
states
still
take
them
as
their
instructors
and
guides
in
every
species
of
literature
in
philosophy
history
oratory
poetry
architecture
and
sculpture
and
those
too
who
have
attained
superiority
over
the
world
in
arms
yield
a
voluntary
subjection
to
the
greeks
in
the
arts
the
cause
of
their
former
excellence
and
their
present
inferiority
is
no
doubt
to
be
found
in
their
former
freedom
and
their
present
slavery
and
in
the
loss
of
that
emulation
which
seems
indispensable
to
natural
greatness
nay
replied
he
i
am
very
far
from
denying
the
influence
of
moral
causes
on
national
character
the
history
of
every
country
affords
abundant
evidence
of
it
i
mean
only
to
say
that
though
it
does
much
it
does
not
do
every
thing
it
seems
more
reasonable
to
impute
the
changes
in
national
character
to
the
mutable
habits
and
institutions
of
man
than
to
nature
which
is
always
the
same
but
if
we
look
a
little
nearer
we
may
perhaps
perceive
that
amidst
all
those
mutations
in
the
character
of
nations
there
are
still
some
features
that
are
common
to
the
same
people
at
all
times
and
which
it
would
therefore
be
reasonable
to
impute
to
the
great
unvarying
laws
of
nature
thus
it
requires
no
extraordinary
acuteness
of
observation
no
strained
hypothesis
to
perceive
a
close
resemblance
between
the
germans
or
the
britons
of
antiquity
and
their
modern
descendants
after
the
lapse
of
eighteen
centuries
and
an
entire
revolution
in
government
religion
language
and
laws
and
travellers
still
perceive
among
the
inhabitants
of
modern
greece
deteriorated
and
debased
as
they
are
by
political
servitude
many
of
those
qualities
which
distinguished
their
predecessors
the
same
natural
acuteness
the
same
sensibility
to
pleasure
the
same
pliancy
of
mind
and
elasticity
of
body
the
same
aptitude
for
the
arts
of
imitation
and
the
same
striking
physiognomy
that
bright
serene
sky
that
happy
combination
of
land
and
water
constituting
the
perfection
of
the
picturesque
and
that
balmy
softness
of
its
air
which
have
proved
themselves
so
propitious
to
forms
of
beauty
agility
and
strength
also
operate
benignantly
on
the
mind
which
animates
them
whilst
the
fruit
is
still
fair
to
the
eye
it
is
not
probable
that
it
has
permanently
degenerated
in
fragrance
or
flavour
the
great
diversities
of
national
character
may
perhaps
be
attributed
principally
to
moral
and
accidental
causes
but
partly
also
to
climate
and
to
original
diversities
in
the
different
races

with

was

to
separate
africa
from

and
asia
was
full
in
our
view
the
political
divisions
of
these
quarters
of
the
world
were
of
course
undistinguishable
and
few
of
the
natural
were
discernible
by
the

eye
the

were
marked
by
a
white
streak
though
less
bright
than
the
water
by
the
aid
of
our
glass
we
could
just
discern
the
danube
the
nile
and
a
river
which
empties
itself
into
the
gulf
of
guinea
and
which
i
took
to
be
the
niger
but
the
other
streams
were
not
perceptible
the
most
conspicuous
object
of
the
solid
part
of
the
globe
was
the
great
desert
before
mentioned
the
whole
of
africa
indeed
was
of
a
lighter
hue
than
either
asia
or
europe
owing
i
presume
to
its
having
a
greater
proportion
of
sandy
soil
and
i
could
not
avoid
contrasting
in
my
mind
the
colour
of
these
continents
as
they
now
appeared
with
the
complexions
of
their
respective
inhabitants
i
was
struck
too
with
the
vast
disproportion
which
the
extent
of
the
several
countries
of
the
earth
bore
to
the
part
they
had
acted
in
history
and
the
influence
they
had
exerted
on
human
affairs
the
british
islands
had
diminished
to
a
speck
and
france
was
little
larger
yet
a
few
years
ago
it
seemed
at
least
to
us
in
the
united
states
as
if
there
were
no
other
nations
on
the
earth
the
brahmin
who
was
well
read
in
european
history
on
my
making
a
remark
on
this
subject
reminded
me
that
athens
and
sparta
had
once
obtained
almost
equal
celebrity
although
they
were
so
small
as
not
now
to
be
visible
as
i
slowly
passed
the
telescope
over
the
face
of
europe
i
pictured
to
myself
the
fat
plodding
hollander
the
patient
contemplative
german
the
ingenious
sensual
italian
the
temperate
swiss
the
haughty
superstitious
spaniard
the
sprightly
frenchman
the
sullen
and
reflecting
englishman
who
monopolize
nearly
all
the
science
and
literature
of
the
earth
to
which
they
bear
so
small
a
proportion
as
the
atlantic
fell
under
our
view
two
faint
circles
on
each
side
of
the
equator
were
to
be
perceived
by
the
naked
eye
they
were
less
bright
than
the
rest
of
the
ocean
the
brahmin
suggested
that
they
might
be
currents
which
brought
to
my
memory
franklin
conjecture
on
the
subject
now
completely
verified
by
this
circular
line
of
vapour
as
it
had
been
previously
rendered
probable
by
the
floating
substances
which
had
been
occasionally
picked
up
at
great
distances
from
the
places
where
they
had
been
thrown
into
the
ocean
the
circle
was
whiter
and
more
distinct
where
the
gulf
stream
runs
parallel
to
the
american
coast
and
gradually
grew
fainter
as
it
passed
along
the
banks
of
newfoundland
to
the
coast
of
europe
where
taking
a
southerly
direction
the
line
of
the
circle
was
barely
discernible
a
similar
circle
of
vapour
though
less
defined
and
complete
was
perceived
in
the
south
atlantic
ocean
when
the
coast
of
my
own
beloved
country
first
presented
itself
to
my
view
i
experienced
the
liveliest
emotions
and
i
felt
so
anxious
to
see
my
children
and
friends
that
i
would
gladly
have
given
up
all
the
promised
pleasures
of
our
expedition
i
even
ventured
to
hint
my
feelings
to
the
brahmin
but
he
gently
rebuking
my
impatience
said
if
to
return
home
had
been
your
only
object
and
not
to
see
what
not
one
of
your
nation
or
race
has
ever
yet
seen
you
ought
to
have
so
informed
me
that
we
might
have
arranged
matters
accordingly
i
do
not
wish
you
to
return
to
your
country
until
you
will
be
enabled
to
make
yourself
welcome
and
useful
there
by
what
you
may
see
in
the
lunar
world
take
courage
then
my
friend
you
have
passed
the
worst
and
as
the
proverb
says
do
not
when
you
have
swallowed
the
ox
now
choke
at
the
tail
besides
although
we
made
all
possible
haste
in
descending
we
should
ere
we
reached
the
surface
find
ourselves
to
the
west
of
your
continent
and
be
compelled
then
to
choose
between
some
part
of
asia
or
the
pacific
ocean
let
us
then
proceed
said
i
mortified
at
the
imputation
on
my
courage
and
influenced
yet
more
perhaps
by
the
last
argument
the
brahmin
then
tried
to
soothe
my
disappointment
by
his
remarks
on
my
native
land
i
have
a
great
curiosity
said
he
to
see
a
country
where
a
man
by
his
labour
can
earn
as
much
in
a
month
as
will
procure
him
bread
and
meat
too
for
the
whole
year
in
a
week
as
will
pay
his
dues
to
the
government
and
in
one
or
two
days
as
will
buy
him
an
acre
of
good
land
where
every
man
preaches
whatever
religion
he
pleases
where
the
priests
of
the
different
sects
never
fight
and
seldom
quarrel
and
stranger
than
all
where
the
authority
of
government
derives
no
aid
from
an
army
and
that
of
the
priests
no
support
from
the
law
i
told
him
when
he
should
see
these
things
in
operation
with
his
own
eyes
as
i
trusted
he
would
if
it
pleased
heaven
to
favour
our
undertakings
they
would
appear
less
strange
i
reminded
him
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
under
which
our
countrymen
had
commenced
their
career
in
all
other
countries
said
i
civilization
and
population
have
gone
hand
in
hand
and
the
necessity
of
an
increasing
subsistence
for
increasing
numbers
has
been
the
parent
of
useful
arts
and
of
social
improvement
in
every
successive
stage
of
their
advancement
such
countries
have
equally
felt
the
evils
occasioned
by
a
scanty
and
precarious
subsistence
in
america
however
the
people
are
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
all
the
arts
of
civilization
while
they
are
unrestricted
in
their
means
of
subsistence
and
consequently
in
their
power
of
multiplication
from
this
singular
state
of
things
two
consequences
result
one
is
that
the
progress
of
the
nation
in
wealth
power
and
greatness
is
more
rapid
than
the
world
has
ever
before
witnessed
another
is
that
our
people
being
less
cramped
and
fettered
by
their
necessities
and
feeling
of
course
less
of
those
moral
evils
which
poverty
and
discomfort
engender
their
character
moral
and
intellectual
will
be
developed
and
matured
with
greater
celerity
and
i
incline
to
think
carried
to
a
higher
point
of
excellence
than
has
ever
yet
been
attained
i
anticipate
for
them
the
eloquence
and
art
of
athens
the
courage
and
love
of
country
of
sparta
the
constancy
and
military
prowess
of
the
romans
the
science
and
literature
of
england
and
france
the
industry
of
the
dutch
the
temperance
and
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
swiss
in
fifty
years
their
numbers
will
amount
to
forty
millions
in
a
century
to
one
hundred
and
sixty
millions
in
two
centuries
allowing
for
a
decreasing
rate
of
multiplication
to
three
or
four
hundred
millions
nor
does
it
seem
impossible
that
from
the
structure
of
their
government
they
may
continue
united
for
a
few
great
national
purposes
while
each
state
may
make
the
laws
that
are
suited
to
its
peculiar
habits
character
and
circumstances
in
another
half
century
they
will
extend
the
christian
religion
and
the
english
language
to
the
pacific
ocean
to
the
south
of
them
on
the
same
continent
other
great
nations
will
arise
who
if
they
were
to
be
equally
united
might
contend
in
terrible
conflicts
for
the
mastery
of
this
great
continent
and
even
of
the
world
but
when
they
shall
be
completely
liberated
from
the
yoke
of
spanish
dominion
and
have
for
some
time
enjoyed
that
full
possession
of
their
faculties
and
energies
which
liberty
only
can
give
they
will
probably
split
into
distinct
states
united
at
first
by
the
sympathy
of
men
struggling
in
the
same
cause
and
by
similarity
of
manners
and
religion
they
will
after
a
while
do
as
men
always
have
done
quarrel
and
fight
and
these
wars
will
check
their
social
improvement
and
mar
their
political
hopes
whether
they
will
successively
fall
under
the
dominion
of
one
able
and
fortunate
leader
or
like
the
motley
sovereignties
of
europe
preserve
their
integrity
by
their
mutual
jealousy
time
only
can
show
your
reasoning
about
the
natives
of
spanish
america
appears
very
probable
said
the
brahmin
but
is
it
not
equally
applicable
to
your
own
country
i
reminded
him
of
the
peculiar
advantages
of
our
government
he
shook
his
head
no
atterley
said
he
do
not
deceive
yourself
the
duration
of
every
species
of
polity
is
uncertain
the
works
of
nature
alone
are
permanent
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
are
the
same
as
they
were
thousands
of
years
ago
but
not
so
with
the
works
of
man
he
is
the
identical
animal
that
he
ever
was
his
political
institutions
however
cunningly
devised
have
always
been
yet
more
perishable
than
his
structures
of
stone
and
marble
this
is
according
to
all
past
history
and
do
not
therefore
count
upon
an
exception
in
your
favour
that
would
be
little
short
of
the
miraculous
but
he
added
such
a
miracle
may
take
place
in
your
system
and
although
i
do
not
expect
it
i
sincerely
wish
it
we
were
now
able
to
see
one
half
of
the
broad
expanse
of
the
pacific
which
glistened
with
the
brightness
of
quicksilver
or
polished
steel
cast
your
eyes
to
the
north
said
he
and
see
where
your
continent
and
mine
approach
so
near
as
almost
to
touch
both
these
coasts
are
at
this
time
thinly
inhabited
by
a
rude
and
miserable
people
whose
whole
time
is
spent
in
struggling
against
the
rigours
of
their
dreary
climate
and
the
scantiness
of
its
productions
yet
perhaps
the
indians
and
the
kamtschadales
will
be
gradually
moulded
into
a
hardy
civilized
people
and
here
may
be
the
scene
of
many
a
fierce
conflict
between
your
people
and
the
russians
whose
numbers
now
four
times
as
great
as
yours
increase
almost
as
rapidly
he
then
amused
me
with
accounts
of
the
manners
and
mode
of
life
of
the
hyperborean
race
with
whom
he
had
once
passed
a
summer
glancing
my
eye
then
to
the
south
see
said
i
while
the
kamtschadale
is
providing
his
supply
of
furs
and
of
fish
for
the
long
winter
which
is
already
knocking
at
the
door
of
his
hut
the
gay
and
voluptuous
native
of
the
sandwich
and
other
islands
between
the
tropics
how
striking
the
contrast
the
one
passes
his
life
in
ease
abundance
and
enjoyment
the
other
in
toil
privation
and
care
no
inclemency
of
the
seasons
inflicts
present
suffering
on
these
happy
islanders
or
brings
apprehensions
for
the
future
nature
presents
them
with
her
most
delicious
fruits
spontaneously
and
abundantly
and
she
has
implanted
in
their
breast
a
lively
relish
for
the
favours
she
so
lavishly
bestows
upon
them
the
brahmin
after
musing
a
while
replied
the
difference
is
far
less
than
you
imagine
perhaps
on
balancing
their
respective
pleasures
and
pains
the
superior
gain
of
the
islander
will
be
reduced
to
nothing
for
as
to
the
simplest
source
of
gratification
that
of
palatable
food
if
nature
produces
it
more
liberally
in
the
islands
she
also
produces
there
more
mouths
to
consume
it
the
richest
kamtschadale
may
indeed
oftener
go
without
a
dinner
than
the
richest
otaheitan
but
it
may
be
quite
the
reverse
with
the
poorest
then
as
to
quality
of
the
food
if
nature
has
provided
more
delicious
fruits
for
the
natives
of
tropical
climates
she
has
given
a
sharper
appetite
and
stronger
digestion
to
the
hyperborean
which
equalizes
the
sum
of
their
enjoyments
a
dry
crust
is
relished
when
an
individual
is
hungry
more
than
the
most
savoury
and
delicate
dainties
when
he
is
in
a
fever
and
water
to
one
man
is
a
more
delicious
beverage
than
the
juice
of
the
grape
or
of
the
palm
to
another
as
to
the
necessity
for
labour
which
is
ever
pressing
on
the
inhabitants
of
cold
countries
it
is
this
consequent
and
incessant
activity
which
gives
health
to
their
bodies
and
cheerful
vigour
to
their
minds
since
without
such
exercise
man
would
have
been
ever
a
prey
to
disease
and
discontent
and
if
no
other
occupation
be
provided
for
the
mind
of
man
it
carves
out
employment
for
itself
in
vain
regrets
and
gloomy
forebodings
in
jealousy
envy
and
the
indulgence
of
every
hateful
and
tormenting
passion
hence
the
proverb
you
want
corn
cultivate
your
soil
if
you
want
weeds
let
it
alone
but
again
the
native
of
those
sunny
isles
is
never
sensible
of
the
bounty
of
providence
till
he
is
deprived
of
it
here
as
well
as
every
where
else

outgoes
gratification
man
sees
or
fancies
much
that
he
can
not
obtain

in
his
regret
for
what
he
wants

what
he
already
possesses
what
is
it
to
one
with
a
that
a
savoury
dish
is
placed
before

it
is
the
same
with
the

as
the

when

engrosses
it
in
one
way
it
can
not

and

their
own
evils
and
inconveniences
you
think
then
said
i
that
the
native
of
kamtschatka
has
the
advantage
no
he
rejoined
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
for
the
evils
of
his
situation
are
likewise
very
great
but
they
are
more
manifest
and
therefore
less
necessary
to
be
brought
to
your
notice
it
was
now
by
our
about
two
in
the
afternoon
that
is
two
hours
had
elapsed
since
we
left
terra
firma
and
saving
a
few
biscuits
and
a
glass
of
cordial
we
had
not
taken
any
sort
of
refreshment
the
brahmin
proposed
that
we
now
should
dine
and
opening
a
small
case
and
drawing
forth
a
cold
fowl
a
piece
of
dried
flesh
a
small
pot
of
ghee
some
biscuits
and
a
bottle
of
arrack
flavoured
with
ginger
and
spices
with
a
larger
one
of
water
we
ate
as
heartily
as
we
had
ever
done
at
the
hermitage
the
slight
motion
of
our
machine
to
one
side
or
the
other
whenever
we
moved
giving
us
nearly
as
much
exercise
as
a
vessel
in
a
smooth
sea
the
animal
food
had
been
provided
for
me
for
the
brahmin
satisfied
his
hunger
with
the
ghee
sweetmeats
and
biscuit
and
ate
sparingly
even
of
them
we
each
took
two
glasses
of
the
cordial
diluted
with
water
and
carefully
putting
back
the
fragments
again
turned
our
thoughts
to
the
planet
we
had
left
the
middle
of
the
pacific
now
lay
immediately
beneath
us
i
had
never
before
been
struck
with
the
irregular
distribution
of
land
and
water
on
our
globe
the
expanse
of
ocean
here
being
twice
as
large
as
in
any
other
part
and
on
remarking
this
striking
difference
to
the
brahmin
he
replied
it
is
the
opinion
of
some
philosophers
in
the
moon
that
their
globe
is
a
fragment
of
ours
and
as
they
can
see
every
part
of
the
surface
they
believe
the
pacific
was
the
place
from
which
the
moon
was
ejected
they
pretend
that
a
short
but
consistent
tradition
of
the
disruption
has
regularly
been
transmitted
from
remote
antiquity
and
they
draw
confirmation
of
their
hypothesis
from
many
words
of
the
chinese
and
other
orientals
with
whom
they
claim
affinity
ridiculous
said
i
the
moon
is
the
diameter
of
the
earth
and
if
the
two
were
united
in
one
sphere
the
highest
mountains
must
have
been
submerged
and
of
course
there
would
have
been
no
human
inhabitants
or
if
any
part
of
the
land
was
then
bare
on
the
waters
retiring
to
fill
up
the
chasm
made
by
the
separation
of
so
large
a
body
as
the
moon
the
parts
before
habitable
would
be
instead
of
two
three
or
at
most
four
miles
as
your
himalah
mountains
are
said
to
be
some
twenty
or
thirty
miles
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
that
is
not
quite
so
certain
said
he
we
know
not
of
what
the
interior
of
the
earth
is
composed
any
more
than
we
could
distinguish
the
contents
of
an
egg
by
penetrating
one
hundredth
part
of
its
shell
but
we
see
that
if
one
drop
of
water
be
united
with
another
they
form
one
large
drop
as
spherical
as
either
of
the
two
which
composed
it
and
on
the
separation
of
the
moon
from
the
earth
if
they
were
composed
of
mingled
solids
and
fluids
or
if
the
solid
parts
rested
on
fluid
both
the
fragment
and
the
remaining
earth
would
assume
the
same
globular
appearance
they
now
present
on
this
subject
however
i
give
no
opinion
i
only
say
that
it
is
not
contradicted
by
the
facts
you
have
mentioned
the
fluid
and
the
solid
parts
settling
down
into
a
new
sphere
might
still
retain
nearly
their
former
proportion
or
if
the
fragment
took
away
a
greater
proportion
of
solid
than
of
fluid
then
the
waters
retiring
to
fill
up
the
cavity
would
leave
parts
bare
which
they
had
formerly
covered
there
are
some
facts
which
give
a
colour
to
this
supposition
for
most
of
the
high
mountains
of
the
earth
afford
evidence
of
former
submersion
and
those
which
are
the
highest
the
himalah
are
situated
in
the
country
to
which
the
origin
of
civilization
and
even
the
human
species
itself
may
be
traced
the
moon
too
we
know
has
much
less
water
than
the
earth
and
all
those
appearances
of
violence
which
have
so
puzzled
cosmogonists
the
position
in
which
vegetable
substances
are
occasionally
found
beneath
the
soil
on
which
they
grew
and
the
clear
manifestations
of
the
action
of
water
in
the
formation
of
strata
in
the
undulating
forms
it
has
left
and
in
the
correspondent
salient
and
retiring
angles
of
mountains
and
opposite
coasts
were
all
caused
by
the
disruption
and
as
the
moon
has
a
smaller
proportion
of
water
than
the
earth
she
has
also
the
highest
mountains
but
father
said
i
the
diameter
of
the
earth
being
but
four
times
as
large
as
that
of
the
moon
how
can
the
violent
separation
of
so
large
a
portion
of
our
planet
be
accounted
for
where
is
the
mighty
agent
to
rend
off
such
a
mass
and
throw
it
to
thirty
times
the
earth
diameter
upon
that
subject
said
he
the
lunarian
sages
are
much
divided
many
hypotheses
have
been
suggested
on
the
subject
some
of
which
are
very
ingenious
and
all
very
fanciful
but
the
two
most
celebrated
and
into
which
all
the
others
are
now
merged
are
those
of
neerlego
and
darcandarca
the
former
of
whom
in
a
treatise
extending
to
nine
quarto
volumes
has
maintained
that
the
disruption
was
caused
by
a
comet
and
the
latter
in
a
work
yet
more
voluminous
has
endeavoured
to
prove
that
when
the
materials
of
the
moon
composed
a
part
of
the
earth
this
planet
contained
large
masses
of
water
which
though
the
particles
cohered
with
each
other
were
disposed
to
fly
off
from
the
earth
and
that
by
an
accumulation
of
the
electric
fluid
according
to
laws
which
he
has
attempted
to
explain
the
force
was
at
length
sufficient
to
heave
the
rocks
which
encompassed
these
masses
from
their
beds
and
to
project
them
from
the
earth
when
partaking
of
the
earth
diurnal
motion
they
assumed
a
spherical
form
and
revolved
around
it
and
further
that
because
the
moon
is
composed
of
two
sorts
of
matter
that
are
differently
affected
towards
the
earth
in
its
revolution
round
that
planet
the
same
parts
of
its
surface
always
maintain
some
relative
position
to
us
which
thus
necessarily
causes
the
singularity
of
her
turning
on
her
axis
precisely
in
the
time
in
which
she
revolves
round
the
earth
i
see
said
i
that
doctors
differ
and
dispute
about
their
own
fancies
every
where
that
is
said
he
because
they
contend
as
vehemently
for
what
they
imagine
as
for
what
they
see
and
perhaps
more
so
as
their
are
like
those
of
other
men
while
their
are
more
exclusively
their
own
thus
in
the
present
instance
the
controversy
turns
upon
the
mode
in
which
the
separation
was
effected
which
affords
the
widest
field
for
conjecture
while
they
both
agree
that
such
separation
has
taken
place
as
to
this
fact
i
have
not
yet
made
up
my
mind
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
is
much
to
give
plausibility
to
their
opinion
i
recognise
for
instance
a
striking
resemblance
between
the
animal
and
vegetable
productions
of
asia
and
those
of
the
moon
do
you
think
father
said
i
that
animal
or
even
vegetable
life
could
possibly
exist
in
such
a
disruption
as
is
supposed
why
not
said
he
you
are
not
to
imagine
that
the
shock
would
be
felt
in
proportion
to
the
mass
that
was
moved
on
the
contrary
while
it
would
occasion
in
some
parts
a
great
destruction
of
life
it
would
in
others
not
be
felt
more
than
an
earthquake
or
rather
than
a
succession
of
earthquakes
during
the
time
that
the
different
parts
of
the
mass
were
adjusting
themselves
to
a
spherical
form
whilst
a
few
pairs
or
even
a
single
pair
of
animals
saved
in
some
cavity
of
a
mountain
would
be
sufficient
in
a
few
centuries
to
stock
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
with
as
many
individuals
as
are
now
to
be
found
on
it
after
all
he
added
it
is
often
difficult
in
science
to
distinguish
truth
from
the
plausibility
which
personates
her
but
let
us
not
however
be
precipitate
let
us
but
hear
both
sides

a

whereupon
the

urged
me
to
take
the
repose
which
it
was
clear
i
needed
remarking
that
when
i
awoke
he
would
follow
my
example
reclining
my
head
then
on
my

in
a
few
minutes
my
senses
were
steeped
in
forgetfulness
i
slept
about
six
hours
most
profoundly
and
on
waking
found
the
good
brahmin
busy
with
his
calculations
of

i
insisted
on
his
now
taking
some
rest
after
requesting
me
to
wake
him
at
the
end
of
three
hours
or
sooner
if

of

should
occur
and
putting
up
a
short
prayer
which
was
manifested
by
his
looks
rather
than
by
his
words
he
laid
himself
down
and
soon
fell
into
a
quiet
sleep
left
now
to
my
own
meditations
and
unsupported
by
the
example
and
conversation
of
my
friend
i
felt
my
first
apprehensions
return
and
began
seriously
to
regret
my
rashness
in
thus
venturing
on
so
bold
an
experiment
which
however
often
repeated
with
success
must
ever
be
hazardous
and
which
could
plead
little
more
in
its
favour
than
a
vain
and
childish
curiosity
i
took
up
a
book
but
whilst
my
eye
ran
over
the
page
i
understood
but
little
what
i
read
and
could
not
relish
even
that
i
now
looked
down
through
the
telescope
and
found
the
earth
surprisingly
diminished
in
her
apparent
dimensions
from
the
increased
rapidity
of
our
ascent
the
eastern
coasts
of
asia
were
still
fully
in
view
as
well
as
the
entire
figure
of
that
vast
continent
of
new
holland
of
ceylon
and
of
borneo
but
the
smaller
islands
were
invisible
i
strained
my
eye
to
no
purpose
to
follow
the
indentations
of
the
coast
according
to
the

before
me

great
bays
and

alone
be
perceived
the
burman
empire
in
one
of
the
insignificant
villages
of
which
i
had
been
confined
for
a
few
years
was
now
reduced
to
a
speck
the
agreeable
hours
i
had
passed
with
the
brahmin
with
the
little
daughter
of
sing
fou
and
my
rambling
over
the
neighbouring
heights
all
recurred
to
my
mind
and
i
almost
regretted
the
pleasures
i
had
relinquished
i
tried
with
more
success
to
beguile
the
time
by
making
notes
in
my
journal
and
after
having
devoted
about
an
hour
to
this
object
i
returned
to
the
telescope
and
now
took
occasion
to
examine
the
figure
of
the
earth
near
the
poles
with
a
view
of
discovering
whether
its
form
favoured
captain
theory
of
an
aperture
existing
there
and
i
am
convinced
that
that
ingenious
gentleman
is
mistaken
time
passed
so
heavily
during
these
solitary
occupations
that
i
looked
at
my
watch
every
five
minutes
and
could
scarcely
be
persuaded
it
was
not
out
of
order
i
then
took
up
my
little
bible
which
had
always
been
my
travelling
companion
read
a
few
chapters
in
matthew
and
found
my
feelings
tranquillized
and
my
courage
increased
the
desired
hour
at
length
arrived
when
on
waking
the
old
man
he
alertly
raised
himself
up
and
at
the
first
view
of
the
diminished
appearance
of
the
earth
observed
that
our
journey
was
a
third
over
as
to
time
but
not
as
to
distance
after
a
few
moments
the
brahmin
again
cast
his
eye
towards
his
own
natal
soil
on
beholding
which
he
fetched
a
deep
sigh
and
if
i
was
not
mistaken
i
saw
a
rising
tear
alas
said
he
my
country
and
my
countrymen
how
different
you
are
in
many
respects
from
what
i
should
wish
you
to
be
and
yet
i
do
not
love
you
the
less
perhaps
i
love
you
the
more
for
your
faults
as
well
as
for
your
misfortunes

is
a
hard
one

abroad
to
adorn
and
benefit
the
other
four
and
these
the
chief
of
human
blessings
and

have
deserted
us
i
told
him
that
i
had
heard
the

claimed

contended
with
true
love
of
country
great
plausibility
and
an
intimate
knowledge
of
oriental
history
that
letters
and
the
arts
had
been
first
transplanted
from
asia
into
egypt
no
other
part
of
africa
said
he
saving
egypt
can
boast
of
any
ancient
monuments
of
the
arts
or
of
civilization
even
the
pyramids
the
great
boast
of
egypt
are
proofs
of
nothing
more
than
ordinary
patient
labour
directed
by
despotic
power
besides
look
at
that
vast
region
extending
five
thousand
miles
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
four
thousand
from
the
red
sea
to
the
atlantic
its
immense
surface
contains
only
ignorant
barbarians
who
are
as
uncivilized
now
as
they
were
three
thousand
years
ago
is
it
likely
that
if
civilization
and
letters
originated
in
egypt
as
is
sometimes
pretended
it
would
have
spread
so
extensively
in
one
direction
and
not
at
all
in
another
i
make
no
exception
in
favour
of
the
carthagenians
whose
origin
was
comparatively
recent
and
who
we
know
were
a
colony
from
asia
i
was
obliged
to
admit
the
force
of
this
reasoning
and
when
he
proceeded
to
descant
on
the
former
glories
and
achievements
of
asiatic
nations
and
their
sad
reverses
of
fortune
while
he
freely
spoke
of
the
present
degradation
and
imbecility
of
his
countrymen
he
promptly
resisted
every
censure
of
mine
it
was
easy
indeed
to
see
that
he
secretly
cherished
a
hope
that
the
day
would
come
when
the
whole
of
hindostan
would
be
emancipated
from
its
european
masters
and
assume
that
rank
among
nations
to
which
the
genius
of
its
inhabitants
entitled
it
he
admitted
that
the
dominion
of
the
english
was
less
oppressive
than
that
of
their
native
princes
but
said
that
there
was
this
great
difference
between
foreign
and
domestic
despotism
that
the
former
completely
extinguished
all
national
pride
which
is
as
much
the
cause
as
the
effect
of
national
greatness
i
asked
him
whether
he
thought
if
his
countrymen
were
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
the
english
they
could
maintain
their
independence
undoubtedly
said
he
who
would
be
able
to
conquer
us
i
suggested
to
him
that
they
might
tempt
the
ambition
of
russia
and
cautiously
inquired
whether
the
abstinence
from
animal
food
might
not
render
his
country
much
less
capable
of
resistance
and
whether
it
might
not
serve
to
explain
why
india
had
so
often
been
the
prey
of
foreign
conquest
of
this
however
he
would
hear
nothing
but
replied
with
more
impatience
than
was
usual
with
him
it
is
true
hindostan
was
invaded
by
alexander
but
not
conquered
and
that
it
has
since
submitted
in
succession
to
the
arabians
to
the
tartars
under
genghis
khan
and
under
tamerlane
to
the
persians
under
nadir
shah
and
finally
to
the
british
but
there
are
few
countries
of
europe
which
have
not
been
conquered
as
often
that
nation
from
which
you
are
descended
and
to
which
mine
is
now
subject
furnishes
no
exception
as
it
has
been
subjugated
in
succession
by
the
romans
the
danes
the
saxons
the
normans
and
as
to
courage
we
see
no
difference
between
those
asiatics
who
eat
animal
food
as
you
do
and
those
who
abstain
from
it
as
i
do
i
am
told
that
the
scotch
peasantry
eat
much
less
animal
food
than
the
english
and
the
irish
far
less
than
they
and
yet
that
these
rank
among
the
best
troops
of
the
british
but
surely
a
nation
ought
not
to
be
suspected
of
fearing
death
whose
very
women
show
a
contempt
of
life
which
no
other
people
have
exhibited
this
led
us
to
talk
of
that
strange
custom
of
his
country
which
impels
the
widow
to
throw
herself
on
the
funeral
pile
of
her
husband
and
to
be
consumed
with
him
i
told
him
that
it
had
often
been
represented
as
compulsory
or
in
other
words
that
it
was
said
that
every
art
and
means
were
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
working
on
the
mind
of
the
woman
by
her
relatives
aided
by
the
priests
who
would
be
naturally
gratified
by
such
signal
triumphs
of
religion
over
the
strongest
feelings
of
nature
he
admitted
that
these
engines
were
sometimes
put
in
operation
and
that
they
impelled
to
the
sacrifice
some
who
were
wavering
but
insisted
that
in
a
majority
of
instances
the
was
voluntary
women
said
he
are
brought
up
from
their
infancy
to
regard
our
sex
as
their
superiors
and
to
believe
that
their
greatest
merit
consists
in
entire
devotion
to
their
husbands
under
this
feeling
and
having
at
the
same
time
their
attention
frequently
turned
to
the
chance
of
such
a
calamity
they
are
better
prepared
to
meet
it
when
it
occurs
how
few
of
the
officers
in
your
western
armies
ever
hesitate
to
march
at
the
head
of
their
men
on
a
forlorn
hope
and
how
many
even
court
the
danger
for
the
sake
of
the
glory
nay
you
tell
me
that
according
to
your
code
of
honour
if
one
man
insults
another
he
who
gives
the
provocation
and
he
who
receives
it
rather
than
be
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
their
countrymen
will
go
out
and
quietly
shoot
at
each
other
with
firearms
till
one
of
them
is
killed
or
wounded
and
this
too
in
many
cases
when
the
injury
has
been
merely
nominal
if
you
show
such
a
contempt
of
death
in
deference
to
a
custom
founded
in
mere
caprice
can
it
be
wondered
that
a
woman
should
show
it
in
the
first
paroxysms
of
her
grief
for
the
loss
of
him
to
whom
was
devoted
every
thought
word
and
action
of
her
life
and
who
next
to
her
god
was
the
object
of
her
idolatry
my
dear
atterley
he
continued
with
emotion
you
little
know
the
strength
of
woman
love
here
he
abruptly
broke
off
the
conversation
and
after
continuing
thoughtful
and
silent
for
some
time
he
remarked
but
do
not
forget
where
we
are
nature
demands
her
accustomed
rest
and
let
us
prepare
to
indulge
her
i
feel
little
inclined
to
sleep
at
present
yet
by
the
time
you
have
taken
some
hours
repose
i
shall
probably
require
the
same
refreshment
i
would
willingly
have
listened
longer
but
yielding
to
his
prudent
suggestion
again
composed
myself
to
rest
and
left
my
good
monitor
to
his
melancholy
meditations
when
i
had
slept
about
four
hours
i
was
awakened
by
the
brahmin
in
whose
arms
i
found
myself
and
who
feeble
as
he
was
handled
me
with
the
ease
that
a
nurse
does
a
child
or
rather
as
a
child
does
her
doll
on
looking
around
i
found
myself
lying
on
what
had
been
the
ceiling
of
our
chamber
which
still
however
felt
like
the
bottom
my
eyes
and
my
feelings
were
thus
in
collision
and
i
could
only
account
for
what
i
saw
by
supposing
that
the
machine
had
been
turned
upside
down
i
was
bewildered
and
alarmed
after
enjoying
my
surprise
for
a
moment
the
brahmin
observed
we
have
while
you
were
asleep
passed
the
middle
point
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
attraction
and
we
now
gravitate
less
towards
our
own
planet
than
her
satellite
i
took
the
precaution
to
move
you
before
you
fell
by
your
own
gravity
from
what
was
lately
the
bottom
to
that
which
is
now
so
and
to
keep
you
in
this
place
until
you
were
retained
in
it
by
the
attraction
for
though
your
fall
would
have
been
at
this
point
like
that
of
a
feather
yet
it
would
have
given
you
some
shock
and
alarm
the
machine
therefore
has
undergone
no
change
in
its
position
or
course
the
change
is
altogether
in
our
feelings
the
brahmin
then
after
having
looked
through
either
telescope
but
for
a
longer
time
through
the
one
at
the
bottom
and
having
performed
his
customary
devotions
soon
fell
into
a
slumber
but
not
into
the
same
quiet
sleep
as
before
for
he
was
often
interrupted
by
sudden
starts
of
so
distressing
a
character
that
i
was
almost
tempted
to
wake
him
after
a
while
however
he
seemed
more
composed
when
i
betook
myself
to
the
telescope
turned
towards
the
earth
the
earth
appearance
i
found
so
diminished
as
not
to
exceed
four
times
the
diameter
of
the
moon
as
seen
from
the
earth
and
its
whole
face
was
entirely
changed
after
the
first
surprise
i
recollected
it
was
the
moon
i
was
then
regarding
and
my
curiosity
was
greatly
awakened
on
raising
myself
up
and
looking
through
the
upper
telescope
the
earth
presented
an
appearance
not
very
dissimilar
but
the
outline
of
her
continents
and
oceans
were
still
perceptible
in
different
shades
and
capable
of
being
easily
recognised
but
the
bright
glare
of
the
sun
made
the
surfaces
of
both
bodies
rather
dim
and
pale
after
a
short
interval
i
again
looked
at
the
moon
and
found
not
only
its
magnitude
very
greatly
increased
but
that
it
was
beginning
to
present
a
more
beautiful
spectacle
the
sun
rays
fell
obliquely
on
her
disc
so
that
by
a
large
part
of
its
surface
not
reflecting
the
light
i
saw
every
object
on
it
so
far
as
i
was
enabled
by
the
power
of
my
telescope
its
mountains
lakes
seas
continents
and
islands
were
faintly
though
not
indistinctly
traced
and
every
moment
brought
forth
something
new
to
catch
my
eye
and
awaken
my
curiosity
the
whole
face
of
the
moon
was
of
a
silvery
hue
relieved
and
varied
by
the
softest
and
most
delicate
shades
no
cloud
nor
speck
of
vapour
intercepted
my
view
one
of
my
exclamations
of
delight
awakened
the
brahmin
who
quickly
arose
and
looking
down
on
the
resplendent
orb
below
us
observed
that
we
must
soon
begin
to
slacken
the
rapidity
of
our
course
by
throwing
out
ballast
the
moon
dimensions
now
rapidly
increased
the
separate
mountains
which
formed
the
ridges
and
chains
on
her
surface
began
to
be
plainly
visible
through
the
telescope
whilst
on
the
shaded
side
several
volcanoes
appeared
upon
her
disc
like
the
flashes
of
our
or
rather
like
the
twinkling
of
stars
in
a
frosty
night
he
remarked
that
the
extraordinary
clearness
and
brightness
of
the
objects
on
the
moon
surface
was
owing
to
her
having
a
less
extensive
and
more
transparent
atmosphere
than
the
earth
adding
the
difference
is
so
great
that
some
of
our
astronomical
observers
have
been
induced
to
think
she
has
none
if
that
however
had
been
the
case
our
voyage
would
have
been
impracticable
after
gazing
at
the
magnificent
spectacle
with
admiration
and
delight
for
half
an
hour
the
brahmin
loosed
one
of
the
balls
of
the
lunar
metal
for
the
purpose
of
checking
our
velocity
at
this
time
he
supposed
we
were
not
more
than
four
thousand
miles
or
about
twice
the
diameter
from
the
nearest
point
of
her
surface
in
about
four
hours
more
her
apparent
magnitude
was
so
great
that
we
could
see
her
by
looking
out
of
either
of
the
dark
her
disc
had
now
lost
its
former
silvery
appearance
and
began
to
look
more
like
that
of
the
earth
when
seen
at
the
same
distance
it
was
a
most
gratifying
spectacle
to
behold
the
objects
successively
rising
to
our
view
and
steadily
enlarging
in
their
dimensions
the
rapidity
with
which
we
approached
the
moon
impressed
me
in
spite
of
myself
with
the
alarming
sensation
of
falling
and
i
found
myself
alternately
agitated
with
a
sense
of
this
danger
and
with
impatience
to
take
a
nearer
view
of
the
new
objects
that
greeted
my
eyes
the
brahmin
was
wholly
absorbed
in
calculations
for
the
purpose
of
adjusting
our
velocity
to
the
distance
we
had
to
go
his
estimates
of
which
however
were
in
a
great
measure
conjectural
and
ever
and
anon
he
would
let
off
a
ball
of
the
lunar
metal
after
a
few
hours
we
were
so
near
the
moon
that
every
object
was
seen
in
our
glass
as
distinctly
as
the
shells
or
marine
plants
through
a
piece
of
shallow
though
the
eye
could
take
in
but
a
small
part
of
her
surface
and
the
horizon
which
bounded
our
view
was
rapidly
contracting
on
letting
the
air
escape
from
our
machine
it
did
not
now
rush
out
with
the
same
violence
as
before
which
showed
that
we
were
within
the
moon
atmosphere
this
as
well
as
ridding
ourselves
of
the
metal
balls
aided
in
checking
our
progress
by
and
bye
we
were
within
a
few
miles
of
the
highest
mountains
when
we
threw
down
so
much
of
our
ballast
that
we
soon
appeared
almost
stationary
the
brahmin
remarked
that
he
should
avail
himself
of
the
currents
of
air
we
might
meet
with
to
select
a
favourable
place
for
landing
though
we
were
necessarily
attracted
towards
the
same
region
in
consequence
of
the
same
half
of
the
moon
surface
being
always
turned
towards
the
earth
in
our
second
voyage
said
he
we
were
glad
to
get
foothold
any
where
for
not
having
lightened
our
machine
sufficiently
we
came
down
with
a
considerable
concussion
on
a
barren
field
remote
from
any
human
habitation
and
suffered
more
from
hunger
and
cold
for
nearly
three
days
than
we
had
done
from
the
perils
and
privations
of
the
voyage
the
next
time
we
aimed
at
landing
near
the
town
of
alamatua
which
stands
as
you
may
see
a
little
to
the
right
of
us
upon
an
island
in
a
lake
and
looks
like
an
emerald
set
in
silver
we
came
down
very
gently
it
is
true
but
we
struck
one
of
the
numerous
boats
which
ply
around
the
island
and
had
nearly
occasioned
the
loss
of
our
lives
as
well
as
of
theirs
in
our
last
voyage
we
were
every
way
fortunate
the
first
part
of
the
moon
we
approached
was
a
level
plain
of
great
extent
divided
into
on
which
having
lowered
our
grapnel
we
drew
ourselves
down
without
difficulty
we
must
now
continued
he
look
out
for
some
cultivated
field
in
one
of
the
valleys
we
are
approaching
where
we
may
rely
on
being
not
far
from
some
human
abode
and
on
escaping
the
perils
of
rocks
trees
and
buildings
while
the
brahmin
was
speaking
a
gentle
breeze
arose
as
appeared
by
our
horizontal
motion
which
wafted
us
at
the
rate
of
about
ten
miles
an
hour
in
succession
over
a
ridge
of
mountains
a
lake
a
thick
wood
and
a
second
lake
until
at
length
we
reached
a
cultivated
region
recognised
by
the
brahmin
as
the
country
of
the
morosofs
the
place
we
were
most
anxious
to
reach
let
off
two
of
the
balls
of
lead
to
the
earth
said
he
i
did
so
and
we
descended
rapidly
when
we
were
sufficiently
near
the
ground
to
see
that
it
was
a
fit
place
for
landing
we
opened
the
door
and
found
the
air
of
the
moon
inconceivably
sweet
and
refreshing
we
now
loosed
one
of
the
lower
balls
and
somewhat
checked
our
descent
in
a
few
minutes
more
however
we
were
within
twenty
yards
of
the
ground
when
we
let
go
the
largest
ball
of
lunarium
which
having
a
cord
attached
to
it
served
us
in
lieu
of
a
grapnel
it
descended
with
great
force
to
the
ground
while
the
machine
thus
lightened
was
disposed
to
mount
again
we
however
drew
ourselves
down
and
as
soon
as
the
machine
touched
the
ground
we
let
off
some
of
our
leaden
balls
to
keep
it
there
we
released
ourselves
from
the
machine
in
a
twinkling
and
our
first
impulse
was
to
fall
on
our
knees
and
return
thanks
for
our
safe
deliverance

many

with
the
remains
of
our
stores
and
secured
the
door
of
our
machine
we
bent
our
course
by
a
plain
road
towards
the
town
we
saw
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
about
three
miles
distant
and
entered
it
a
little
before
the
sun
had
descended
behind
the
adjacent
mountain
the
town
of
alamatua
seemed
to
contain
about
two
thousand
houses
and
to
be
not
quite
as
large
as
albany
the
houses
were
built
of
a
soft
shining
stone
and
they
all
had
porticoes
piazzas
and
verandas
suited
to
the
tropical
climate
of
morosofia
the
people
were
tall
and
thin
of
a
pale
yellowish
complexion
and
their
garments
light
loose
and
flowing
and
not
very
different
from
those
of
the
turks
the
lower
order
of
people
commonly
wore
but
a
single
garment
which
passed
round
the
waist
one
half
the
houses
were
under
ground
partly
to
screen
them
from
the
continued
action
of
the
sun
rays
and
partly
on
account
of
the
earthquakes
caused
by
volcanoes
the
windows
of
their
houses
were
different
from
any
i
had
ever
seen
before
they
consisted
of
openings
in
the
wall
sloping
so
much
upwards
that
while
they
freely
admitted
the
light
and
air
the
sun
was
completely
excluded
and
although
those
who
were
within
could
readily
see
what
was
passing
in
the
streets
they
were
concealed
from
the
gaze
of
the
curious
in
their
it
was
common
to
have
mirrors
in
the
ceilings
which
at
once
reflected
the
street
passengers
to
those
who
were
on
the
floor
and
enabled
the
ostentatious
to
display
to
the
public
eye
the
decorations
of
their
tables
whenever
they
gave
a
sumptuous
feast
the
inhabitants
subsist
chiefly
on
a
vegetable
diet
live
about
as
long
as
they
do
on
the
earth
notwithstanding
the
great
difference
of
climate
and
other
circumstances
and
in
short
do
not
in
their
manners
habits
or
character
differ
more
from
the
inhabitants
of
our
planet
than
some
of
these
differ
from
one
another
their
government
was
anciently
monarchical
but
is
now
popular
their
code
of
laws
is
said
to
be
very
intricate
their
language
naturally
soft
and
musical
has
been
yet
further
refined
by
the
cultivation
of
letters
they
have
a
variety
of
sects
in
religion
politics
and
philosophy
the
territory
of
morosofia
is
about
miles
square
this
brief
sketch
must
content
the
reader
for
the
present
i
refer
those
who
are
desirous
of
being
more
particularly
informed
to
the
work
which
i
propose
to
publish
on
lunar
geography
and
in
the
mean
time
some
of
the
most
striking
peculiarities
of
this
people
in
opinions
manners
and
customs
will
be
developed
in
this
which
must
be
considered
as
my
as
soon
as
we
were
espied
by
the
inhabitants
we
were
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
little
boys
as
well
as
all
the
idle
and
inquisitive
near
us
the
brahmin
had
not
gone
far
before
he
was
met
by
some
persons
of
his
acquaintance
who
immediately
recognised
him
and
seemed
very
much
pleased
to
see
him
again
in
the
moon
they
politely
conducted
us
to
the
house
of
the
governor
who
received
us
very
graciously
he
appeared
to
be
about
years
of
age
was
dressed
in
a
suit
and
had
a
mild
amiable
deportment
he
began
a
course
of
interesting
inquiry
about
the
affairs
of
the
earth
but
a
gentleman
whom
we
afterwards
understood
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
popular
party
coming
in
he
soon
despatched
us
having
however
first
directed
an
officer
to
furnish
us
with
all
that
was
necessary
for
our
accommodation
at
the
public
expense
which
act
of
hospitality
we
have
reason
to
fear
occasioned
him
some
trouble
and
perplexity
at
the
succeeding
election
we
very
gladly
withdrew
as
both
by
reason
of
our
long
walk
and
the
excitement
produced
by
so
many
new
objects
we
were
greatly
fatigued
the
officer
conducted
us
to
respectable
private
lodgings
in
a
lightsome
situation
which
overlooked
the
chief
part
of
the
city
after
a
frugal
but
not
unpalatable
repast
and
a
few
hours
sleep
the
brahmin
took
me
round
the
city
and
a
part
of
its
environs
to
make
me
acquainted
with
the
public
buildings
streets
shops
and
the
appearance
of
the
inhabitants
i
soon
found
that
our
arrival
was
generally
known
and
that
we
excited
quite
as
much
curiosity
as
we
felt
though
many
of
the
persons
we
met
had
seen
the
brahmin
before
i
was
surprised
that
we
saw
none
of
their
women
but
the
brahmin
told
me
that
they
were
every
where
gazing
through
their
windows
and
on
looking
up
through
these
slanting
apertures
i
could
often
see
their
eyes
peeping
over
the
upper
edge
of
the
i
shall
now
proceed
to
record
faithfully
what
i
deem
most
memorable
not
as
many
travellers
have
done
from
their
recollection
after
their
return
home
but
from
notes
which
i
regularly
made
either
at
the
moment
of
observation
or
very
shortly
afterwards
when
we
first
visited
the
shops
i
was
equally
gratified
and
surprised
with
what
was
familiar
and
what
was
new
but
i
was
particularly
amused
with
those
of
the
tailors
and
milliners
in
the
lower
part
of
their
dress
the
lunarians
chiefly
resemble
the
europeans
but
in
the
upper
part
the
asiatics
for
they
shave
the
head
and
wear
turbans
from
which
fact
the
brahmin
drew
another
argument
in
favour
of
the
hypothesis
that
the
moon
was
originally
a
part
of
the
earth
some
of
the
female
fashions
were
so
extremely
singular
and
fanciful
as
to
deserve
particular
mention
one
piece
of
their
attire
was
formed
of
a
long
piece
of
light
stiff
wood
covered
with
silk
and
decorated
with
showy
ornaments
it
was
worn
across
the
shoulders
beyond
each
of
which
it
jutted
out
about
half
a
yard
and
from
either
end
a
cord
led
to
a
ring
running
round
the
upper
part
of
the
head
bearing
no
small
resemblance
to
the
yard
of
a
mast
and
the
ropes
used
for
steering
it
several
other
dresses
i
saw
which
i
am
satisfied
would
be
highly
disapproved
by
my
modest
countrywomen
thus
in
some
were
inserted
glasses
like
watch
crystals
adapted
to
the
form
and
size
of
the
female
bosom
but
to
do
the
lunar
ladies
justice
i
understood
that
these
dresses
were
condemned
by
the
sedate
part
of
the
sex
and
were
worn
only
by
the
young
and
thoughtless
who
were
vain
of
their
forms
i
observed
too
that
instead
of
decorating
their
heads
with
flowers
like
the
ladies
of
our
earth
they
taxed
the
animal
world
for
a
correspondent
ornament
many
of
the
were
made
of
a
stiff
open
gauze
occasionally
stuck
over
with
insects
of
the
butterfly
and
species
and
others
of
the
gayest
hues
at
other
times
these
insects
were
alive
when
their
perpetual
buzzing
and
fluttering
in
their
transparent
cages
had
a
very
animating
effect
one
decoration
for
the
head
in
particular
struck
my
fancy
it
was
formed
of
a
silver
tissue
containing
fireflies
and
intended
to
be
worn
in
the
night
but
the
most
remarkable
thing
of
all
was
the
whim
of
the
ladies
in
the
upper
classes
of
making
themselves
as
much
like
birds
as
possible
in
which
art
it
must
be
confessed
they
were
wonderfully
successful
the
dress
used
for
this
purpose
consisted
of
a
sort
of
thick
cloak
covered
with
feathers
like
those
of
the
south
sea
islands
and
was
so
fashioned
by
means
of
a
tight
thick
quilting
as
to
make
the
wearer
at
a
little
distance
very
much
resemble
an
overgrown
bird
except
that
the
legs
were
somewhat
too
thick
their
arms
were
concealed
under
the
wings
and
the
resemblance
was
yet
further
increased
by
marks
with
beaks
adapted
to
the
particular
plumage
some
personating
doves
some
magpies
others
again
hawks
parrots
according
to
their
natural
figure
humour
while
the
deception
was
still
further
assisted
by
their
extraordinary
agility
compared
with
ours
by
means
of
which
they
could
with
ease
hop
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
i
told
the
brahmin
that
some
of
the
indians
of
our
continent
showed
a
similar
taste
in
dress
by
decorating
themselves
with
horns
like
the
buffalo
and
with
tails
like
horses
which
furnished
him
with
a
further
argument
in
favour
of
a
common
origin
we
spent
above
an
hour
in
examining
these
curious
habiliments
and
in
inquiring
the
purposes
and
uses
of
the
several
parts
sometimes
i
was
induced
through
the
brahmin
to
criticise
their
taste
and
skill
having
been
always
an
admirer
of
simplicity
in
female
attire
but
i
remarked
on
this
occasion
as
on
several
others
subsequently
that
the
people
of
the
moon
were
neither
very
thankful
for
advice
nor
thought
very
highly
of
the
judgment
of
those
who
differ
from
them
in
opinion
after
having
rambled
over
the
city
about
six
hours
our
appetites
told
us
it
was
time
to
return
to
our
lodgings
and
here
i
met
with
a
new
cause
of
wonder
the
family
with
whom
we
were
domesticated
belonged
to
a
numerous
and
zealous
sect
of
religionists
and
were
in
their
way
very
worthy
as
well
as
pious
people
their
dinner
consisted
of
several
dishes
of
vegetables
variously
served
up
of
roots
stalks
seeds
flowers
and
fruits
some
of
which
resembled
the
productions
of
the
earth
and
in
particular
i
saw
a
dish
of
what
i
at
first
took
to
be
very
fine
asparagus
but
supposed
i
was
mistaken
when
i
saw
them
eat
the
coarse
fibrous
part
alone
on
tasting
it
however
in
the
ordinary
way
i
found
it
to
be
genuine
good
asparagus
but
i
perceived
that
the
family
looked
extremely
shocked
at
my
taste
after
the
other
dishes
were
removed
some
large
fruit
of
the
peach
kind
were
set
on
the
table
when
the
members
of
the
family
having
carefully
paired
off
the
skin
ate
it
and
threw
the
rest
away
they
in
like
manner
chewed
the
shells
of
some
small
grayish
nuts
and
threw
away
the
kernels
which
to
me
were
very
palatable
the
younger
children
consisting
of
two
boys
and
a
girl
exchanged
looks
with
each
other
at
the
selections
i
made
and
i
thought
i
perceived
in
the
looks
of
the
mother
still
more
aversion
than
surprise
i
found
too
that
my
friend
the
brahmin
abstained
from
all
these
things
and
partook
only
of
those
vegetables
and
fruits
of
which
both
they
and
i
ate
alike
some
wine
was
offered
us
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
vinegar
and
what
added
to
my
surprise
a
bottle
which
they
said
was
not
yet
fit
to
drink
seemed
to
me
to
be
pretty
good
the
brahmin
having
passed
it
to
me
for
my
judgment
as
soon
as
they
pronounced
upon
it
sentence
of
condemnation
after
we
arose
from
this
strange
scene
and
had
withdrawn
to
our
chamber
i
expressed
my
surprise
to
my
companion
at
this
contrariety
in
the
tastes
of
the
terrestrials
and
lunarians
whereupon
he
told
me
that
the
difference
was
rather
apparent
than
real
these
people
said
he
belong
to
a
sect
of
ascetics
in
this
country
who
are
persuaded
that
all
pleasure
received
through
the
senses
is
sinful
and
that
man
never
appears
so
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
the
deity
as
when
he
rejects
all
the
delicacies
of
the
palate
as
well
as
other
sensual
gratifications
and
imposes
on
himself
that
food
to
which
he
feels
naturally
most
repugnant
you
may
see
that
those
peaches
which
were
so
disdainfully
thrown
into
the
yard
are
often
secretly
picked
up
by
the
children
who
obey
the
impulses
of
nature
and
devour
them
most
greedily
even
in
the
old
people
themselves
there
is
occasionally
some
backsliding
into
the
depravity
of
worldly
appetite
you
might
have
perceived
that
while
the
old
man
was
abusing
the
wine
you
drank
as
unripe
and
making
wry
faces
at
it
he
still
kept
tasting
it
and
if
i
had
not
reached
it
to
you
he
would
probably
before
he
had
ceased
his
meditations
have
finished
half
the
bottle
it
must
be
confessed
that
although
religion
cherishes
our
best
feelings
it
also
often
proves
a
cloak
for
the
worst
i
told
him
that
our
clergy
were
superior
to
this
weakness
most
of
them
manifesting
a
proper
sense
of
the
bounty
of
providence
by
eating
and
drinking
of
the
best
not
very
sparingly
neither
and
that
in
we
considered
some
of
our
preachers
the
best
judges
of
wine
among
us
soon
afterwards
we
again
sallied
forth
in
quest
of
adventures
and
bent
our
course
towards
the
suburbs
we
had
not
gone
far
before
we
saw
several
persons
looking
at
a
man
working
hard
at
a
forge
in
a
low
crazy
building
on
approaching
him
we
found
he
was
engaged
in
making
nails
an
operation
which
he
performed
with
great
skill
and
adroitness
and
as
soon
as
he
had
made
as
many
as
he
could
take
up
in
his
hand
at
once
he
carried
them
behind
his
little
hovel
and
dropped
them
into
a
narrow
deep
well
some
of
the
wished
to
beg
a
few
of
what
he
seemed
to
value
so
lightly
and
others
offered
to
give
him
bread
or
clothes
in
exchange
for
his
nails
but
he
obstinately
resisted
all
their
applications
in
fact
little
heeding
them
although
he
was
almost
naked
had
a
starved
haggard
appearance
and
evidently
regarded
the
food
they
proffered
with
a
wishful
eye
the
lookers
on
told
us
the
blacksmith
had
been
for
years
engaged
in
this
business
of
he
worked
with
little
intermission
scarcely
allowing
himself
time
for
necessary
sleep
or
refreshment
that
all
the
fruits
of
his
incessant
labour
were
disposed
of
in
the
manner
we
had
just
seen
and
that
he
had
already
three
wells
filled
with
nails
which
he
had
carefully
closed
he
had
moreover
a
large
and
productive
farm
the
increase
arising
from
which
was
laid
out
in
exchange
for
the
metal
of
which
his
nails
were
made
he
had
we
were
informed
so
much
attachment
to
these
pieces
of
metal
that
he
was
often
on
the
point
of
starvation
before
he
would
part
with
one
i
observed
to
the
brahmin
that
it
was
a
singular
and
somewhat
inexplicable
species
of
madness
true
he
replied
this
man
conduct
can
not
be
explained
upon
any
rational
principles
but
he
is
one
of
the
glonglims
of
which
i
have
spoken
to
you
and
examples
are
not
wanting
on
our
planet
of
conduct
as
irreconcilable
to
reason
this
man
is
making
an
article
which
is
scarce
as
well
as
useful
in
this
country
where
gravity
is
less
than
it
is
with
us
the
force
of
the
wind
is
very
great
and
the
metal
is
possessed
but
by
a
few
now
if
you
suppose
these
nails
to
be
pieces
of
gold
and
silver
his
conduct
will
be
precisely
that
of
some
of
our
misers
who
waste
their
days
and
nights
in
hoarding
up
wealth
which
they
never
use
nor
mean
to
use
but
denying
themselves
every
comfort
of
life
anxiously
and
unceasingly
toil
for
those
who
are
to
come
after
them
though
they
are
so
far
from
feeling
towards
these
successors
any
peculiar
affection
that
they
often
regard
them
with
jealousy
and
hatred
while
we
thus
conversed
there
stepped
up
to
us
a
handsome
man
foppishly
dressed
in
blue
trowsers
a
pink
vest
and
a
red
and
white
turban
who
after
having
shaken
my
companion
by
the
ears
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
among
intimate
friends
expressed
his
delight
at
seeing
him
again
in
morosofia
he
then
went
on
in
a
lively
humorous
strain
to
ridicule
the
and
told
us
several
stories
of
his
singular
attachment
to
his
nails
in
the
midst
of
these
sallies
however
a
harsh
looking
personage
in
brown
came
up
upon
which
the
countenance
of
our
lively
acquaintance
suddenly
changed
and
they
walked
off
together
i
apprehend
said
the
brahmin
that
my
gay
acquaintance
yonder
continues
as
he
formerly
was
the
man
in
brown
who
so
unseasonably
interrupted
his
pleasantry
is
an
officer
of
justice
and
has
probably
taken
him
before
a
magistrate
to
answer
some
one
of
his
numerous
creditors
you
must
know
added
he
that
the
people
of
the
moon
however
irrational
themselves
are
very
prompt
in
perceiving
the
absurdities
of
others
and
this
lively
wit
who
as
you
see
wants
neither
parts
nor
address
acts
as
strangely
as
the
wretch
he
has
been
ridiculing
he
inherited
a
large
estate
which
brought
him
in
a
princely
revenue
and
yet
his
desires
and
expenses
so
far
outgo
his
means
that
he
is
always
in
want
both
he
and
the
nailmaker
suffer
the
evils
of
poverty
of
poverty
created
by
themselves
which
moreover
they
can
terminate
when
they
please
but
they
must
reach
the
same
point
by
directly
opposite
roads
the
blacksmith
will
allow
himself
nothing
the
beau
will
deny
himself
nothing
the
one
is
a
slave
to
pleasure
the
other
the
victim
of
fear
i
told
you
that
there
were
but
few
whose
estates
produced
the
metal
of
which
these
nails
are
made
and
this
thoughtless
youth
happens
to
be
one
a
few
years
since
he
wanted
some
of
the
blacksmith
nails
to
purchase
the
first
rose
of
the
season
and
pledged
his
mines
to
pay
at
the
end
of
the
year
three
times
the
amount
he
received
in
exchange
and
although
if
he
were
to
use
but
half
his
income
for
a
single
year
the
other
half
would
discharge
his
debts
i
apprehend
from
what
i
have
heard
that
he
has
from
that
time
to
this
continued
to
pay
the
same
exorbitant
interest
when
i
was
here
before
i
prevailed
on
him
to
take
a
ride
with
me
into
the
country
and
under
one
pretext
or
another
detained
him
ten
days
at
a
friend
house
where
he
had
no
inducement
to
expense
when
he
returned
he
found
his
debts
paid
off
but
knowing
he
was
master
of
so
ready
and
effectual
an
expedient
he
the
next
day
borrowed
double
the
sum
at
the
old
rate
since
that
time
his
debts
have
accumulated
so
rapidly
that
he
will
probably
now
be
compelled
to
surrender
his
whole
estate
is
he
also
a
glonglim
i
asked
assuredly
what
man
in
his
entire
senses
could
act
so
irrationally
there
is
nothing
on
earth
that
exceeds
this

the

atterley

with
a

his
character
and
after
we
had
been
in
the
moon
about
forty
eight
hours
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
and
the
long
twilight
of
the
lunarians
had
begun
i
will
here
take
occasion
to
notice
the
physical
peculiarities
of
this
country
which
though
very
familiar
to
those
who
are
versed
in
astronomy
may
not
be
unacceptable
to
the
less
scientific
portion
of
my
readers
the
sun
is
above
the
horizon
nearly
a
fortnight
and
below
it
as
long
of
course
the
day
here
is
equal
to
about
of
ours
the
earth
answers
the
same
purpose
to
half
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
that
the
moon
does
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
the
face
of
the
latter
however
is
more
than
twelve
times
as
large
and
it
has
not
the
same
silvery
appearance
as
the
moon
but
is
rather
of
a
dingy
pink
hue
like
that
of
her
iron
when
beginning
to
lose
its
red
heat
as
the
same
part
of
the
moon
is
always
turned
to
the
earth
one
half
of
her
surface
is
perpetually
illuminated
by
a
moon
ten
times
as
large
to
the
eye
as
the
sun
the
other
hemisphere
is
without
a
moon
the
favoured
part
therefore
never
experiences
total
darkness
the
earth
reflecting
to
the
lunarians
as
much
light
as
we
terrestrials
have
a
little
before
sunrise
or
after
sunset
but
our
planet
presents
to
the
lunarians
the
same
changes
as
the
moon
does
to
us
according
to
its
position
in
relation
to
the
sun
it
always
however
appears
to
occupy
nearly
the
same
part
of
the
heavens
when
seen
from
the
same
point
on
the
moon
surface
but
its
altitude
above
the
horizon
is
greater
or
less
according
to
the
latitude
of
the
place
from
which
it
is
seen
so
that
there
is
not
a
point
of
the
heavens
which
the
earth
may
not
be
seen
permanently
to
occupy
according
to
the
part
of
the
moon
from
which
the
planet
is
viewed
from
the
length
of
time
that
the
sun
is
above
the
horizon
the
continued
action
of
his
rays
in
those
climates
where
they
fall
vertically
or
nearly
so
would
be
intolerable
if
it
was
not
for
the
high
mountains
from
whose
summits
a
perpetual
breeze
derives
a
refreshing
coolness
and
for
the
deep
glens
and
recesses
in
which
most
animals
seek
protection
from
his
meridian
beams
the
transitions
from
heat
to
cold
are
less
than
one
would
expect
from
the
length
of
their
days
and
nights
the
coolness
of
the
one
as
well
as
the
heat
of
the
other
being
tempered
by
a
constant
east
wind
the
climate
gradually
becomes
colder
as
we
approach
the
poles
but
there
is
little
or
no
change
of
seasons
in
the
same
latitude
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
have
not
the
same
regularity
in
their
meals
or
time
for
sleep
as
we
have
but
consult
their
appetites
and
inclinations
like
other
animals
but
they
make
amends
for
this
irregularity
by
a
very
strict
and
punctilious
observance
of
festivals
which
are
regulated
by
the
motions
of
the
sun
at
whose
rising
and
setting
they
have
their
appropriate
ceremonies
those
which
are
kept
at
sunrise
are
gay
and
cheerful
like
the
hopes
which
the
approach
of
that
benignant
luminary
inspires
the
others
are
of
a
grave
and
sober
character
as
if
to
prepare
the
mind
for
serious
contemplation
in
their
night
when
the
earth
is
at
the
full
which
is
their
midnight
it
is
also
a
season
of
great
festivity
with
them
of
the
are
as
common
with
the
lunarians
as
those
of
the
moon
are
with
us
the
same
relative
position
of
the
three
bodies
producing
this
phenomenon
but
an
of
the
never
takes
place
as
the
shadow
of
the
moon
passes
over
the
broad
disc
of
our
planet
merely
as
a
dark
spot
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
can
always
determine
both
their
latitude
and
longitude
by
observing
the
quarter
of
the
heavens
in
which
the
earth
is
seen
and
as
the
sun
invariably
appears
of
the
same
altitude
at
their
noon
the
inhabitants
are
denominated
and
classed
according
to
the
length
of
their
shadows
and
the
terms
or
are
common
forms
of
national
reproach
among
them
according
to
the
relative
position
of
the
parties
i
found
the
climate
of
those
whose
shadows
are
about
the
length
of
their
own
figure
the
most
agreeably
to
my
own
feelings
and
most
like
that
of
my
own
country
such
are
the
most
striking
natural
appearances
on
one
side
of
this
satellite
on
the
other
there
is
some
difference
the
sun
pursues
the
same
path
in
the
corresponding
latitudes
of
both
hemispheres
but
being
without
any
moon
they
have
a
dull
and
dreary
night
though
the
light
from
the
stars
is
much
greater
than
with
us
the
science
of
astronomy
is
much
cultivated
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
dark
hemisphere
and
is
indebted
to
them
for
its
most
important
discoveries
and
its
present
high
state
of
improvement
if
there
is
much
rivalship
among
the
natives
of
the
same
hemisphere
who
differ
in
the
length
of
their
shadows
they
all
unite
in
hatred
and
contempt
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
opposite
side
those
who
have
the
benefit
of
a
moon
that
is
who
are
turned
towards
the
earth
are
lively
indolent
and
changeable
as
the
face
of
the
luminary
on
which
they
pride
themselves
while
those
on
the
other
side
are
more
grave
sedate
and
industrious
the
first
are
called
the
hilliboos
and
the
last
the
moriboos
or
bright
nights
and
dark
nights
and
this
mutual
animosity
is
the
more
remarkable
as
they
often
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
same
race
and
to
differ
much
less
from
one
another
than
the
natives
of
different
climates
it
is
true
that
enlightened
and
well
educated
men
do
not
seem
to
feel
this
prejudice
or
at
least
they
do
not
show
it
but
those
who
travel
from
one
hemisphere
to
the
other
are
sure
to
encounter
the
prejudices
of
the
vulgar
and
are
often
treated
with
great
contempt
and
indignity
they
are
pointed
at
by
the
children
who
according
as
they
chance
to
have
been
bred
on
one
side
or
the
other
say
there
goes
a
man
who
never
saw
glootin
as
they
call
the
earth
or
there
goes
a
booblimak
which
means
a
night
stroller
all
bodies
are
much
lighter
on
the
moon
than
on
the
earth
by
reason
of
which
circumstance
as
has
been
mentioned
the
inhabitants
are
more
active
and
experience
much
less
fatigue
in
ascending
their
precipitous
mountains
i
was
astonished
at
first
at
this
seeming
increase
in
my
muscular
powers
when
on
passing
along
a
street
in
alamatua
soon
after
my
arrival
and
meeting
a
dog
which
i
thought
to
be
mad
i
proposed
to
run
out
of
his
way
and
in
leaping
over
a
gutter
i
fairly
bounded
across
the
street
i
measured
the
distance
the
next
day
and
found
it
to
be
feet
five
inches
and
afterwards
frequently
saw
the
when
engaged
in
athletic
exercises
make
running
leaps
of
between
thirty
and
forty
feet
backwards
and
forwards
another
consequence
of
the
diminished
gravity
here
is
that
both
men
and
animals
carry
much
greater
burdens
than
on
the
earth
the
carriages
are
drawn
altogether
by
dogs
which
are
the
largest
animals
they
have
except
the
zebra
and
a
small
buffalo
this
diminution
of
gravity
is
however
of
some
disadvantage
to
them
many
of
their
tools
are
not
as
efficient
as
ours
especially
their
axes
hoes
and
hammers
on
the
other
hand
when
a
person
falls
to
the
ground
it
is
nearly
the
same
thing
as
if
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
were
to
fall
on
a
feather
bed
yet
i
saw
as
many
instances
of
fractured
limbs
hernia
and
other
accidents
there
as
i
ever
saw
on
the
earth
for
when
they
fall
from
great
heights
or
miscarry
in
the
feats
of
activity
which
they
ambitiously
attempt
it
inflicts
the
same
injury
upon
them
as
a
fall
nearer
the
ground
does
upon
us
after
we
had
been
here
sufficiently
long
to
see
what
was
most
remarkable
in
the
city
and
i
had
committed
the
fruit
of
my
observations
to
paper
the
brahmin
proposed
to
carry
me
to
one
of
the
monthly
suppers
of
a
philosopher
whom
he
knew
and
who
had
obtained
great
celebrity
by
his
writings
and
opinions
we
accordingly
went
and
found
him
sitting
at
a
small
table
and
apparently
exhausted
with
the
labour
of
composition
and
the
ardour
of
intense
thought
he
was
a
small
man
of
quick
abrupt
manners
occasionally
very
abstracted
but
more
frequently
voluble
earnest
and
disputatious
he
frankly
told
us
he
was
sorry
to
see
us
as
he
was
then
putting
the
last
finish
to
a
great
and
useful
work
he
was
about
to
publish
that
we
had
thus
unseasonably
broken
the
current
of
his
thoughts
and
he
might
not
be
able
to
revive
it
for
some
days
upon
my
rising
to
take
my
leave
he
assured
me
that
it
would
be
adding
to
the
injury
already
done
if
we
then
quitted
him
he
said
he
wished
to
learn
the
particulars
of
our
voyage
and
that
he
in
turn
should
certainly
render
us
service
by
disclosing
some
of
the
results
of
his
own
reflections
he
further
remarked
that
he
expected
six
or
eight
friends
that
is
correcting
himself
enlightened
and
congenial
minds
to
supper
on
the
rising
of
a
constellation
he
named
which
time
he
remarked
would
soon
arrive
finding
his
frankness
to
be
thus
seasoned
with
hospitality
we
resumed
our
seats
it
soon
appeared
that
he
was
more
disposed
to
communicate
information
than
to
seek
it
and
i
became
a
patient
listener
if
the
boldness
and
strangeness
of
his
opinions
occasionally
startled
me
i
could
not
but
admire
the
clearness
with
which
he
stated
his
propositions
the
fervour
of
his
elocution
and
the
plausibility
of
his
arguments
the
expected
guests
at
length
arrived
and
various
questions
of
morals
and
legislation
were
started
in
which
the
disputants
seemed
sometimes
as
if
they
would
have
laid
aside
the
character
of
philosophers
but
for
the
seasonable
interposition
of
the
brahmin
wigurd
our
host
often
laboured
with
his
accustomed
zeal
to
prove
that
every
one
who
opposed
him
was
either
a
fool
or
biassed
by
some
petty
interest
or
the
dupe
of
blind
prejudice
after
about
two
hours
of
warm
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
unprofitable
discussion
we
were
summoned
to
our
repast
in
the
adjoining
room
but
before
we
rose
from
our
seats
our
host
requested
to
know
of
each
of
us
if
we
were
hungry
and
whether
it
were
from
modesty
perverseness
or
really
because
they
had
no
appetite
i
know
not
but
a
majority
of
the
company
in
which
i
was
included
voted
that
their
hour
of
eating
was
not
yet
come
upon
which
wigurd
remarked
that
his
own
vote
as
being
at
home
and
the
brahmin
as
being
at
once
a
philosopher
and
a
stranger
should
each
count
for
two
and
by
this
mode
of
reckoning
there
was
a
casting
vote
in
favour
of
going
to
supper
we
found
the
table
covered
with
tempting
dishes
served
up
in
a
costly
and
tasteful
style
and
a
sprightly
female
prepared
to
do
the
honours
of
the
feast
she
reproved
our
host
for
his
delay
and
told
him
the
best
dish
was
spoiled
by
being
cold
i
was
fearful
of
a
discussion
but
he
sat
down
without
making
a
reply
and
immediately
addressing
the
company
descanted
on
the
various
qualities
of
food
and
their
several
adaptations
to
different
ages
constitutions
and
temperaments
he
condemned
the
absurd
practice
which
prevailed
for
the
master
or
mistress
of
the
house
to
lavish
entreaties
on
their
guests
to
eat
that
which
they
might
be
better
without
and
insisted
at
the
same
time
that
the
guests
ought
not
to
consult
their
own
tastes
exclusively
he
maintained
that
the
only
course
worthy
of
rational
and
benevolent
beings
was
for
every
man
to
judge
for
his
neighbour
as
well
as
for
himself
and
should
any
collision
arise
between
the
different
claimants
then
if
any
one
were
guided
by
that
decision
which
an
honest
and
unbiassed
judgment
would
tell
him
was
right
they
would
all
come
to
the
same
just
and
harmonious
result
but
added
he
you
have
not
yet
been
sufficiently
prepared
for
this
disinterested
operation
as
ye
have
proved
this
night
that
ye
are
not
yet
purged
of
the
feelings
and
prejudices
of
a
vicious
education
i
will
perform
this
office
for
you
all
and
set
you
an
example
by
which
ye
may
hereafter
profit
to
begin
then
with
you
addressing
himself
to
a
corpulent
man
of
a
florid
complexion
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
as
you
already
have
a
redundancy
of
flesh
and
blood
i
assign
the
to
you
while
to
our
mathematical
friend
on
this
side
whose
delicate
constitution
requires
nourishment
i
recommend
the
smoking
ragoût
this
cooling
dish
will
suit
your
temperament
said
he
to
a
third
and
this
stimulating
one
yours
to
a
fourth
those
little
birds
which
cost
me
five
pieces
i
shall
divide
between
my
terrestrial
friend
here
looking
at
the
brahmin
and
myself
we
being
the
most
meritorious
of
the
company
and
it
being
of
the
utmost
importance
to
society
that
food
so
wholesome
should
give
nourishment
to
our
bodies
and
impart
vigour
and
vivacity
to
our
minds
from
this
decision
there
was
no
appeal
and
no
other
dissent
than
what
was
expressed
by
a
look
or
a
low
murmur
but
i
perceived
the
corpulent
gentleman
and
the
wan
mathematician
slily
exchange
their
dishes
by
which
they
both
seemed
to
consider
themselves
gainers
the
dish
allotted
to
me
being
of
a
middling
character
i
ate
of
it
without
repining
though
from
the
savoury
fumes
of
my
neighbour
plate
i
could
not
help
wishing
i
had
been
allowed
to
choose
for
myself
this
supper
happening
near
the
middle
of
the
night
at
which
time
it
was
always
pretty
cool
a
cheerful
fire
blazed
in
one
side
of
the
room
and
i
perceived
that
our
host
and
hostess
placed
themselves
so
as
to
be
at
the
most
agreeable
distance
the
greater
part
of
the
guests
being
either
too
near
or
too
far
from
it
after
we
had
finished
our
repast
various
subjects
of
speculation
were
again
introduced
and
discussed
greatly
to
my
amusement
wigurd
displayed
his
usual
ingenuity
and
ardour
and
baffled
all
his
antagonists
by
his
vehemence
and
fluency
he
had
two
great
principles
by
which
he
tested
the
good
or
evil
of
every
thing
and
there
were
few
questions
in
which
he
could
not
avail
himself
of
one
or
the
other
these
were
general
and
by
a
skilful
use
of
these
weapons
of
controversy
he
could
attack
or
defend
with
equal
success
if
any
custom
or
institution
which
he
had
denounced
was
justified
by
his
adversaries
on
the
ground
of
its
expediency
he
immediately
retorted
on
them
its
repugnancy
to
sincerity
truth
and
unsophisticated
nature
and
if
they
at
any
time
resorted
to
a
similar
justification
for
our
natural
feelings
and
propensities
he
triumphantly
showed
that
they
were
inimical
to
the
public
good
thus
he
condemned
gratitude
as
a
sentiment
calculated
to
weaken
the
sense
of
justice
and
to
substitute
feeling
for
reason
he
on
the
other
hand
proscribed
the
little
forms
and
courtesies
which
are
either
founded
in
convenience
or
give
a
grace
and
sweetness
to
social
intercourse
as
a
direct
violation
of
honest
nature
and
therefore
odious
and
mean
he
thus
was
able
to
silence
every
opponent
i
was
very
desirous
of
hearing
the
brahmin
opinion
but
while
he
evidently
was
not
convinced
by
our
host
language
he
declined
engaging
in
any
controversy
after
we
retired
my
friend
told
me
that
wigurd
was
a
good
man
in
the
main
though
he
had
been
as
much
hated
by
some
as
if
his
conduct
had
been
immoral
instead
of
his
opinions
merely
being
singular
he
not
long
ago
added
the
brahmin
wrote
a
book
against
marriage
and
soon
afterwards
wedded
in
due
form
the
lady
you
saw
at
his
table
she
holds
as
strange
tenets
as
he
which
she
supports
with
as
much
zeal
and
almost
as
much
ability
but
i
predict
that
the
popularity
of
their
doctrines
will
not
last
and
if
ever
you
visit
the
moon
again
you
will
find
that
their
glory
now
at
its
height
like
the
ephemeral
fashions
of
the
earth
will
have
passed
away

celebrated

his
ingenious
theories
in
physics
his
mechanical
inventions
the
on
returning
to
our
lodgings
we
acting
under
the
influence
of
long
habit
went
to
bed
though
half
the
family
were
up
and
engaged
in
their
ordinary
employments
one
consequence
of
the
length
of
the
days
and
nights
here
is
that
every
household
is
commonly
divided
into
two
parts
which
watch
and
sleep
by
turns
nor
have
they
any
uniformity
in
their
meals
except
in
particular
families
which
are
regulated
by
clocks
and
the
vulgar
have
no
means
of
measuring
smaller
portions
of
time
than
a
day
or
night
each
equal
to
a
fortnight
with
us
except
by
observing
the
apparent
motion
of
the
sun
or
the
stars
in
which
considering
that
it
is
nearly
thirty
times
as
slow
as
with
us
they
attain
surprising
accuracy
they
have
the
same
short
intervals
of
labour
and
rest
in
their
long
night
as
their
day
the
light
reflected
from
the
earth
being
commonly
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
perform
almost
any
operation
and
ere
our
planet
is
in
her
second
quarter
one
may
read
the
smallest
print
by
her
light
to
compensate
their
want
of
this
natural
advantage
the
inhabitants
of
moriboozia
are
abundantly
supplied
with
a
petroleum
or
bituminous
liquid
which
is
found
every
where
about
their
lakes
or
on
their
mountains
and
which
they
burn
in
lamps
of
various
sizes
shapes
and
constructions
they
have
also
numerous
volcanoes
each
of
which
sheds
a
strong
light
for
many
miles
around
we
slept
unusually
long
and
owing
in
part
to
wigurd
good
cheer
i
awoke
with
a
i
got
up
to
take
a
long
walk
which
often
relieves
me
when
suffering
from
that
malady
and
on
ascending
the
stairs
i
met
our
landlord
eldest
daughter
a
tall
graceful
girl
of
twenty
i
found
she
was
coming
down
backwards
which
i
took
to
be
a
mere
girlish
freak
or
perhaps
a
piece
of
coquetry
practised
on
myself
but
i
afterwards
found
that
about
the
time
the
earth
is
at
the
full
the
whole
family
pursued
the
same
course
and
were
very
scrupulous
in
making
their
steps
in
this
awkward
and
inconvenient
way
because
it
was
one
of
the
prescribed
forms
of
their
church
as
my
became
rather
worse
than
better
from
my
walk
the
brahmin
proposed
to
accompany
me
to
the
house
of
a
celebrated
physician
called
vindar
who
was
also
a
botanist
chemist
and
dentist
to
consult
him
on
my
case
and
thither
we
forthwith
proceeded
i
found
him
a
large
unwieldy
figure
of
a
dull
heavy
look
but
by
no
means
deficient
in
science
or
natural
shrewdness
he
confirmed
my
previous
impression
that
i
ought
to
lose
blood
and
plausibly
enough
accounted
for
my
present
sensation
of
fulness
from
the
inferior
pressure
of
the
lunar
atmosphere
to
that
which
i
had
been
accustomed
he
proposed
however
to
return
to
my
veins
a
portion
of
thinner
blood
in
place
of
what
he
should
take
away
and
offered
me
the
choice
of
several
animals
which
he
always
kept
by
him
for
that
purpose
there
were
two
white
animals
of
the
hog
kind
a
male
and
a
female
lama
three
goats
besides
several
birds
about
the
size
of
a
turkey
some
tortoises
and
other
amphibious
animals
he
professed
himself
willing
in
case
i
had
any
foolish
scruples
against
mixing
my
blood
with
that
of
brutes
to
purify
my
own
and
put
it
back
but
i
obstinately
declined
both
expedients
whereupon
he
opened
a
vein
in
my
arm
and
took
from
it
about
fourteen
ounces
of
blood
finding
myself
weakened
as
well
as
relieved
by
the
operation
he
invited
me
to
rest
myself
and
while
i
was
recovering
my
strength
he
discoursed
with
the
brahmin
and
myself
on
several
of
his
favourite
topics
on
returning
home
i
committed
to
paper
some
of
the
most
remarkable
of
his
opinions
which
it
may
be
as
well
to
notice
that
those
who
have
since
propounded
or
may
hereafter
propound
the
same
to
the
world
may
not
claim
the
merit
of
originality
he
maintained
that
the
number
of
our
senses
was
greater
than
that
commonly
assigned
to
us
that
we
had
for
example
a
sense
of
acids
of
alkalies
of
weight
and
of
heat
that
acid
substances
acted
upon
our
bodies
by
a
peculiar
set
of
nerves
or
through
some
medium
of
their
own
was
evident
from
this
that
they
set
the
teeth
on
edge
though
these
from
their
hard
and
bony
nature
are
insensible
to
the
touch
that
astringents
shrivelled
up
the
flesh
and
puckered
the
mouth
even
when
their
taste
was
not
perceived
that
when
the
skin
shrunk
on
the
application
of
vinegar
could
it
be
said
that
it
had
not
a
peculiar
sense
of
this
liquid
or
rather
of
its
acidity
since
the
existence
of
the
senses
was
known
only
by
effects
which
external
matter
produced
on
them
that
the
senses
like
that
of
touch
were
seated
in
most
parts
of
the
body
but
were
most
acute
in
the
mouth
nose
ears
and
eyes
he
showed
some
disposition
to
maintain
the
popular
notions
of
the
greeks
and
romans
that
the
rivers
and
streams
are
endowed
with
reason
and
volition
and
endeavoured
to
prove
that
some
of
their
windings
and
deviations
from
a
straight
line
can
not
be
explained
upon
mechanical
principles
vindar
is
moreover
a
projector
of
a
very
bold
character
and
not
long
ago
petitioned
the
commanding
general
of
an
army
suddenly
raised
to
repel
an
incursion
of
one
of
their
neighbours
to
march
his
troops
into
for
the
purpose
of
digging
a
canal
from
one
of
their
petroleum
lakes
into
morosofia
and
conducting
it
by
smaller
streams
over
that
country
for
the
purpose
of
warming
it
during
their
long
cool
nights
he
has
too
a
large
grist
and
saw
mill
which
are
put
in
motion
by
the
explosion
of
gunpowder
this
is
conveyed
by
a
sufficiently
ingenious
machine
in
very
small
portions
to
the
bottom
of
an
upright
cylinder
which
is
immediately
shut
perfectly
close
a
flint
and
steel
are
at
the
same
time
made
to
strike
directly
over
it
and
to
ignite
the
powder
the
air
that
is
thus
generated
forces
up
a
piston
through
a
cylinder
which
piston
striking
the
arm
of
a
wheel
puts
it
in
motion
and
with
it
the
machinery
of
the
mills
a
complete
revolution
of
the
wheel
again
prepares
the
cylinder
for
a
fresh
supply
of
gunpowder
which
is
set
on
fire
and
produces
the
same
effect
as
before
he
told
me
he
had
been
fifteen
years
perfecting
this
great
work
in
which
time
it
had
been
twice
blown
up
by
accidents
arising
from
the
carelessness
or
mismanagement
of
the
workmen
but
that
he
now
expected
it
would
repay
him
for
the
time
and
money
he
had
expended
he
had
once
he
said
intended
to
use
the
expansive
force
of
congelation
for
his
moving
power
but
he
found
after
making
a
full
and
accurate
calculation
that
the
labourers
required
to
keep
the
machine
supplied
with
ice
consumed
something
more
than
twice
as
much
corn
as
the
mill
would
grind
in
the
same
time
he
then
was
about
to
move
it
to
a
fine
stream
of
water
in
the
neighbourhood
which
by
being
dammed
up
so
as
to
form
a
large
pond
would
afford
him
a
convenient
and
inexhaustible
supply
of
ice
but
the
millwright
after
the
dam
was
completed
having
artfully
obtained
his
permission
to
use
the
waste
water
and
fraudulently
erected
there
a
common
which
soon
obtained
all
the
neighbouring
custom
he
had
sold
out
that
property
and
resorted
to
the
agency
of
gunpowder
which
is
quite
as
philosophical
a
process
as
that
of
congelation
and
much
less
expensive
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
of
the
brahmin
he
admitted
that
though
he
had
been
able
by
the
force
of
congelation
to
burst
metallic
tubes
several
inches
thick
he
had
never
succeeded
in
making
it
put
the
lightest
machinery
into
a
continued
motion
having
now
nearly
recovered
and
being
i
confess
somewhat
bewildered
by
the
variety
and
complexity
of
these
ingenious
projects
i
felt
disposed
to
take
my
leave
but
vindar
insisted
on
conducting
us
into
an
inner
apartment
to
see
his
this
was
a
large
piece
of
furniture
profusely
decorated
with
metals
of
various
colours
curiously
and
fantastically
inlaid
it
contained
a
prodigious
number
of
drawers
which
were
labelled
after
the
manner
of
those
in
an
apothecary
shop
from
whence
he
denied
however
that
he
first
took
the
hint
and
the
labels
were
arranged
in
alphabetical
order
now
says
he
as
the
excellence
of
poetry
consists
in
bringing
before
the
mind
eye
what
can
be
brought
before
the
corporeal
eye
i
have
here
collected
every
object
that
is
either
beautiful
or
pleasing
in
nature
whether
by
its
form
colour
fragrance
sweetness
or
other
quality
as
well
as
those
that
are
strikingly
disagreeable
when
i
wish
to
exhibit
those
pictures
which
constitute
poetry
i
consult
the
appropriate
cabinet
and
i
take
my
choice
of
those
various
substances
which
can
best
call
up
the
image
i
wish
to
present
to
my
reader
for
example
suppose
i
wish
to
speak
of
any
object
that
is
white
or
analogous
to
white
i
open
the
drawer
that
is
thus
labelled
and
i
see
silver
lime
chalk
and
white
enamel
ivory
paper
and
alabaster
and
select
whichever
of
these
substances
will
best
suit
the
measure
and
the
rhyme
and
has
the
most
name
if
the
colour
be
yellow
then
there
are
substances
of
all
shades
of
this
hue
from
saffron
and
pickled
salmon
to
brimstone
and
straw
i
have
red
substances
green
ones
and
others
in
the
same
proportion
it
is
astonishing
what
labour
this
box
has
saved
me
and
how
much
it
has
added
to
the
beauty
and
melody
of
my
verse
you
perceive
he
added
the
drawer
missing
that
contained
substances
offensive
to
the
sight
or
smell
which
my
maid
conducted
to
it
by
her
nose
conceived
to
be
some
animal
curiosities
i
had
been
collecting
in
a
state
of
putrefaction
and
decay
and
did
not
hesitate
to
throw
them
into
the
fire
i
afterwards
found
myself
very
much
at
a
loss
whenever
my
subject
led
me
to
the
mention
of
objects
of
this
character
and
i
therefore
spoke
of
them
as
seldom
as
possible
after
bestowing
that
tribute
of
admiration
and
praise
which
every
great
author
or
inventor
expects
in
his
own
house
and
not
omitting
his
customary
medical
fee
we
took
our
leave
we
had
not
long
left
vindar
house
before
we
saw
a
short
fat
man
in
the
suburbs
preparing
to
climb
to
the
top
of
a
plane
tree
on
which
there
was
one
of
the
tail
feathers
of
a
sort
of
flamingo
he
was
surrounded
by
attendants
and
servants
to
whom
he
issued
his
commands
with
great
rapidity
and
decision
occasionally
intermingling
with
his
orders
the
most
threatening
language
and
furious
gesticulations
some
offered
to
get
a
ladder
and
ascend
and
others
to
cut
down
the
tree
all
of
which
he
obstinately
rejected
he
swore
he
would
get
the
feather
he
would
get
it
by
climbing
and
he
would
climb
but
one
way
which
way
was
on
the
shoulders
of
his
men
his
plan
was
to
make
a
number
of
them
form
a
solid
square
and
interlock
their
arms
then
a
smaller
number
to
mount
upon
their
shoulders
on
whom
others
were
in
like
manner
placed
and
so
on
till
the
pyramid
was
sufficiently
high
when
he
himself
was
to
mount
and
from
the
shoulders
of
the
highest
pluck
the
darling
object
of
his
wishes
he
had
in
this
way
i
afterwards
learnt
gathered
some
of
the
richest
flowers
of
the
bignonia
scarlatina
as
well
as
such
fruits
as
had
tempted
him
by
their
luscious
appearance
and
at
the
same
time
frightening
all
the
birds
from
their
nests
which
he
commonly
destroyed
and
although
some
of
his
attendants
were
occasionally
much
hurt
and
bruised
in
this
singular
amusement
he
still
persevered
in
it
he
had
continued
it
for
several
years
with
no
intermission
except
a
short
one
when
he
was
engaged
in
breaking
a
young
llana
in
the
place
of
an
old
one
which
had
been
many
years
a
favourite
but
was
now
in
disgrace
because
as
he
said
he
did
not
think
it
so
safe
for
going
down
hill
but
in
reality
because
he
liked
the
figure
and
movements
of
the
young
one
better
i
could
not
see
this
rash
glonglim
attempt
to
climb
that
dangerous
ladder
without
feeling
alarm
for
his
safety
at
first
all
seemed
to
go
on
very
well
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
lay
hold
of
the
gaudy
prize
there
arose
a
sudden
squall
which
threw
both
him
and
his
supporters
into
confusion
and
the
whole
living
pyramid
came
to
the
ground
together
many
were
killed
some
were
wounded
and
bruised
polenap
himself
by
lighting
on
his
men
who
served
him
as
cushions
barely
escaped
with
life
but
he
received
a
fracture
in
the
upper
part
of
his
head
and
a
dislocation
of
the
hip
which
will
not
only
prevent
him
from
ever
climbing
again
but
probably
make
him
a
cripple
for
life
the
brahmin
and
i
endeavoured
to
give
the
sufferers
some
assistance
but
this
was
rendered
unnecessary
by
the
crowd
which
their
cries
and
lamentations
brought
to
their
relief
i
thought
that
the
author
of
so
much
mischief
would
have
been
stoned
on
the
spot
but
to
my
surprise
his
servants
seemed
to
feel
as
much
for
his
honour
as
their
own
safety
and
warmly
interfered
in
his
behalf
until

chapter
ix
philosopher
who
inspected
the
finger
nails
his
visiters
another
philosopher
who
judged
of
the
character
by
the
hair
the
duped
predatory
as
we
returned
to
our
lodgings
we
saw
a
number
of
persons
some
of
whom
were
entering
and
some
leaving
a
neat
small
dwelling
and
on
joining
the
throng
we
learnt
that
a
famous
lived
there
who
at
stated
periods
opened
his
house
to
all
that
were
willing
to
pay
for
being
instructed
in
the
events
of
futurity
or
for
having
the
secrets
of
the
present
or
past
revealed
to
them
on
entering
the
house
and
descending
a
flight
of
steps
we
found
at
the
farther
end
of
a
dark
room
lighted
with
a
chandelier
suspended
from
the
ceiling
an
elderly
man
with
a
long
gray
beard
and
a
thin
pale
countenance
deeply
furrowed
with
thought
rather
than
care
he
received
us
politely
and
then
resumed
the
duties
of
his
vocation
his
course
of
proceeding
was
to
examine
the
finger
nails
and
according
to
their
form
colour
thickness
surface
and
grain
to
determine
the
character
and
destinies
of
those
who
consulted
him
i
was
at
once
pleased
and
surprised
at
the
minuteness
of
his
observation
and
the
infinite
variety
of
his
distinctions
besides
the
qualities
of
the
nails
that
i
have
mentioned
he
noticed
some
which
altogether
eluded
my
senses
such
as
their
milkiness
flintiness
friability
elasticity
tenacity
and
sensibility
whether
they
were
aqueous
unctious
or
mealy
with
many
more
which
have
escaped
my
recollection
a
modest
pensive
looking
girl
apparently
about
seventeen
was
timidly
holding
forth
her
hand
for
examination
at
the
time
we
entered
avarabet
for
that
was
the
name
of
this
philosopher
uttered
two
or
three
words
with
a
significant
shake
of
his
head
upon
which
i
saw
the
rising
tear
in
her
eyes
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
had
not
courage
to
let
him
take
another
look
a
fat
woman
of
a
sanguine
temperament
holding
a
little
girl
by
the
hand
then
stepped
up
and
showed
her
fingers
he
pronounced
her
amorous
inconstant
prone
to
anger
and
extravagant
that
she
had
made
one
man
miserable
and
would
probably
make
another
she
also
abruptly
withdrew
giving
manifest
signs
of
one
of
the
qualities
ascribed
to
her
an
elderly
matron
then
approached
holding
forth
one
trembling
palsied
hand
with
a
small
volume
in
the
other
avarabet
hesitated
for
some
time
examined
the
edges
as
well
as
the
surface
of
the
nails
drew
his
finger
slowly
over
them
and
then
said
you
have
a
susceptible
heart
you
are
in
sorrow
but
your
affliction
will
soon
have
an
end
it
was
easy
to
see
in
the
look
of
the
applicant
signs
of
pious
resignation
and
a
lively
hope
of
another
and
a
better
state
of
existence
i
thought
i
perceived
in
the
scene
that
was
passing
before
us
an
exhibition
that
is
not
uncommon
on
our
earth
of
cunning
knavery
imposing
on
ignorance
and
credulity
and
i
expressed
my
opinion
to
the
brahmin
but
he
assured
me
that
the
class
of
persons
in
the
moon
who
were
resorted
to
on
account
of
their
supposed
powers
of
divination
was
very
different
from
the
similar
class
in
asia
or
europe
and
that
oracular
art
was
here
regularly
studied
and
professed
as
a
branch
of
philosophy
you
would
be
surprised
said
he
to
find
how
successful
they
have
been
in
investing
their
craft
with
the
forms
and
trappings
of
science
the
parade
of
classification
and
the
mystery
imparted
by
technical
terms
by
these
means
they
have
given
plausibility
enough
to
their
theories
to
leave
many
a
one
in
doubt
whether
it
is
really
a
new
triumph
of
human
discovery
or
merely
a
later
form
of
empiricism
its
professors
are
commonly
converts
to
their
own
theories
at
least
in
a
great
degree
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
there
can
mingle
with
the
disposition
to
deceive
others
the
power
of
deceiving
one
self
and
while
they
exercise
much
acuteness
and
penetration
in
discovering
by
the
air
look
dress
and
manner
of
those
who
consult
them
the
leading
points
in
the
history
or
character
of
persons
of
whom
they
have
no
previous
knowledge
they
at
the
same
time
persuade
themselves
that
they
see
something
indicative
of
their
circumstances
in
their
finger
nails
such
is
the
equivocal
character
of
the
greater
part
of
their
sect
but
there
are
some
who
are
mere
honest
dupes
to
the
pretensions
of
the
science
and
others
again
who
have
not
one
tittle
of
credulity
to
extenuate
their
impudent
pretensions
when
i
was
here
before
i
remember
a
physician
who
acquired
great
celebrity
by
affecting
to
cure
diseases
by
examining
a
lock
of
the
patient
hair
and
not
content
with
merely
pronouncing
on
the
nature
of
the
disease
and
suggesting
the
remedy
he
would
enter
into
an
elaborate
and
often
plausible
course
of
reasoning
in
defence
of
his
system
that
system
was
briefly
this
that
the
hair
derived
its
length
strength
hue
and
other
properties
from
the
brain
which
opinion
he
supported
by
a
reference
to
acknowledged
facts
as
that
it
changes
its
hue
with
the
difference
of
the
mental
character
in
the
different
stages
of
life
that
violent
affections
of
the
mind
such
as
grief
or
fear
have
been
known
to
change
it
in
a
single
night
science
on
this
as
on
other
occasions
is
merely
augmenting
and
methodizing
facts
that
the
mass
of
mankind
had
long
observed
as
that
red
hair
had
always
been
considered
indicative
of
warm
temperament
that
affliction
and
even
love
were
believed
to
create
baldness
and
that
in
great
terror
the
hair
stands
on
end
the
different
ages
too
are
distinguished
as
much
by
their
hair
as
their
complexion
their
facial
angle
or
in
any
other
way
he
was
led
to
this
theory
first
by
observing
at
school
that
a
boy
of
a
stiff
bristly
head
of
hair
was
remarkably
cruel
he
professed
to
have
been
able
from
a
long
course
of
observation
to
assign
to
every
different
colour
and
variety
of
hair
its
peculiar
temperament
and
character
one
mental
quality
was
indicated
by
its
length
another
by
its
fineness
and
others
again
as
it
chanced
to
be
greasy
or
lank
or
curled
he
would
also
blow
on
it
with
a
bellows
to
see
how
the
parts
arranged
themselves
hold
it
near
the
fire
and
watch
the
operation
of
its
crisping
by
the
heat
and
although
he
had
often
been
mistaken
in
his
estimates
of
character
by
the
rules
of
his
new
science
he
did
not
lose
the
confidence
of
his
disciples
on
that
account
some
of
them
refusing
to
believe
the
truth
rather
than
to
admit
themselves
mistaken
and
others
insisting
that
if
his
science
was
not
infallible
it
very
rarely
deceived
it
was
now
our
turn
to
submit
our
hands
to
avarabet
for
examination
he
discovered
signs
of
the
loftiest
virtues
and
most
heroic
enterprise
in
the
brahmin
and
near
the
bottom
of
one
of
his
nails
a
sorrow
which
would
leave
him
only
with
his
life
a
transient
shade
of
gloom
on
the
brahmin
countenance
was
soon
succeeded
by
a
piercing
inquisitive
glance
cast
on
the
diviner
he
saw
the
other
eyes
directed
on
the
miniature
which
he
always
wore
and
which
discovered
itself
to
avarabet
as
he
stooped
forward
a
smile
of
contempt
now
took
the
place
of
his
first
surprise
and
he
seemed
in
a
state
of
abstraction
during
the
continued
rhapsodies
of
the
oracle
my
hand
was
next
examined
but
little
was
said
of
me
except
that
i
had
been
a
great
traveller
and
should
be
so
again
that
i
should
encounter
many
dangers
and
difficulties
that
i
possessed
more
intelligence
than
sensibility
and
more
prudence
than
generosity
thus
he
discovered
in
me
great
courage
enterprise
and
constancy
of
purpose
a
hale
robust
man
now
bursting
through
the
crowd
and
thrusting
out
his
hand
abruptly
asked
the
wise
man
to
tell
him
if
he
could
in
what
part
of
the
country
he
lived
avarabet
mentioned
a
distant
district
on
the
coast
of
morosofia
good
said
the
other
and
what
is
my
calling
after
a
slight
pause
he
replied
that
he
got
his
living
on
the
water
good
again
shall
i
ever
be
rich
no
not
very
never
better
and
better
rejoined
the
inquirer
at
the
same
time
giving
vent
to
a
loud
and
hearty
laugh
surely
thought
i
sailors
are
every
where
the
same
sort
of
beings
rough
and
boisterous
as
the
elements
they
roam
over
and
what
is
your
opinion
of
me
farther
you
are
bold
frank
improvident
credulous
and
excellent
indeed
now
what
will
you
say
old
sham
wisdom
when
i
tell
you
that
i
never
made
a
voyage
in
my
life
was
never
two
days
journey
from
this
spot
and
am
seldom
off
my
own
dominion
that
i
own
the
forest
of
tongloo
where
i
sometimes
hunt
from
morning
till
night
and
from
night
till
morning
twelve
out
of
the
thirteen
days
in
the
year
that
my
wealth
which
was
considerable
when
i
came
to
my
estate
has
by
my
habits
of
life
greatly
increased
and
that
i
am
bent
upon
adding
to
it
yet
more
i
drink
nothing
but
water
and
have
come
here
only
to
win
a
wager
that
you
were
not
as
knowing
as
you
pretended
to
be
and
that
i
could
impose
on
you
you
thus
have
a
specimen
of
my
candour
improvidence
and
credulity
so
saying
he
leaped
on
his
zebra
gave
a
sort
of
huntsman
shout
and
was
off
in
a
twinkling
this
adventure
created
great
tumult
in
the
crowd
a
few
enjoying
the
jest
but
the
greater
number
manifesting
and
resentment
towards
the
sportsman
the
brahmin
and
i
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
to
withdraw
unnoticed
by
the
bystanders
after
remaining
at
our
lodgings
long
enough
to
take
rest
and
refreshment
and
to
make
minutes
of
what
we
had
seen
we
proposed
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
the
country
the
weather
being
more
pleasant
at
this
time
in
that
climate
than
when
the
sun
is
above
the
horizon
we
accordingly
set
out
when
the
earth
was
in
her
second
quarter
and
it
was
about
two
of
our
days
before
sunrise
after
walking
about
three
miles
the
freshness
of
the
morning
air
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
and
the
music
of
innumerable
birds
whose
unceasing
carols
testified
their
joy
and
delight
at
the
approach
of
a
more
genial
month
we
came
to
a
large
well
cultivated
farm
in
which
a
number
of
coarse
looking
men
were
employed
with
the
aid
of
dogs
and
other
martial
weapons
in
hunting
down
llamas
and
a
small
kind
of
buffalo
which
in
one
of
our
former
walks
we
had
seen
quietly
feeding
on
a
rich
and
extensive
pasture
we
inquired
of
some
stragglers
from
the
throng
the
meaning
of
what
we
saw
but
they
were
too
much
occupied
with
their
sport
to
afford
us
any
satisfaction
we
walked
on
indulging
our
imaginations
in
conjecture
but
had
not
proceeded
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
we
beheld
a
similar
scene
going
on
to
our
left
by
the
same
crew
our
curiosity
was
now
redoubled
and
we
resolved
to
wait
a
while
on
the
highway
for
the
chance
of
some
passenger
more
at
leisure
to
answer
our
inquiries
and
more
courteously
inclined
than
these
fierce
marauders
we
had
not
stopped
many
minutes
before
a
man
wearing
the
appearance
of
authority
having
ridden
up
we
asked
him
to
explain
the
cause
of
their
violent
and
seemingly
lawless
proceedings
you
are
strangers
i
see
or
you
would
have
understood
that
i
am
exercising
my
baronial
privilege
of
doing
myself
justice
these
cattle
belong
to
the
owners
of
a
neighbouring
estate
by
whom
i
and
my
tenants
have
been
injured
and
insulted
and
according
to
the
usage
in
such
cases
i
have
given
the
signal
to
my
people
to
lay
hold
on
what
they
can
of
his
flocks
and
herds
and
to
quicken
their
exertions
i
give
them
half
of
what
they
catch
and
how
does
your
neighbour
bear
this
in
the
mean
time
said
the
brahmin
oh
for
that
matter
said
the
other
he
is
not
at
all
behindhand
and
i
lose
nearly
as
many
cattle
as
i
get
but
it
gives
me
much
more
pleasure
to
kill
one
of
his
buffaloes
or
llamas
than
it
does
pain
me
when
he
kills
one
of
mine
i
consider
how
much
it
will
vex
him
and
that
some
of
his
vassals
are
thereby
deprived
of
their
sustenance
i
have
upwards
of
thirty
strong
men
employed
in
ranging
this
plain
and
wood
and
during
the
last
year
they
took
for
me
four
hundred
head
indeed
and
how
many
did
you
lose
in
the
same
time
not
above
three
hundred
and
eighty
but
very
inferior
said
the
brahmin
why
no
replied
he
as
my
pastures
are
richer
and
more
luxuriant
than
his
two
of
my
cattle
are
worth
perhaps
three
of
his
is
this
custom
asked
the
brahmin
an
advantage
or
a
tax
on
your
estate
a
tax
indeed
why
it
is
worth
from
four
to
five
hundred
head
and
how
much
is
it
worth
to
your
neighbour
i
presume
nearly
as
much
do
your
vassals
get
rich
by
the
bounty
you
give
them
as
to
that
matter
some
who
are
lucky
succeed
very
well
and
the
rest
make
a
living
by
it
and
what
do
they
give
you
for
the
privilege
of
hunting
your
cattle
nothing
at
all
i
even
lose
my
customary
rent
from
those
who
engage
in
it
and
it
is
the
same
case
with
your
neighbour
certainly
said
he
then
said
the
brahmin
it
seems
to
me
if
you
would
agree
to
lay
aside
this
old
custom
you
would
both
be
considerable
gainers
i
see
you
look
incredulous
but
listen
a
moment
each
one
would
in
that
case
instead
of
having
half
his
neighbour
cattle
have
all
his
own
and
being
kept
in
their
native
pastures
they
would
be
less
likely
to
stray
away
and
you
could
therefore
slay
and
eat
as
you
wanted
them
whereas
in
your
hunting
matches
many
more
are
either
killed
or
maimed
than
are
wanted
for
present
use
and
they
are
consequently
consumed
in
waste
you
would
moreover
be
a
gainer
by
the
amount
of
the
labour
of
these
thirty
boors
whom
you
keep
in
this
employment
and
who
very
probably
acquire
habits
of
ferocity
licentiousness
and
waste
which
are
not
very
favourable
to
their
obedience
or
fidelity
the
proprietor
having
pondered
a
while
upon
my
friend
remarks
in
a
tone
of
exultation
said
do
you
think
then
i
could
ever
prevail
on
my
people
to
forbear
when
they
saw
a
likely
flock
from
laying
violent
hands
on
it
or
could
i
resist
so
favourable
an
opportunity
of
revenge
nay
more
if
we
were
then
tamely
to
tie
up
our
hands
do
you
think
that
bulderent
and
his
men
would
consent
to
do
the
same
no
no
old
man
he
continued
with
great
your
arguments
appear
plausible
at
first
but
when
closely
considered
they
will
not
stand
the
lest
of
experience
they
are
the
fancies
of
a
stranger
of
one
who
knows
more
of
theory
than
practice
had
you
lived
longer
among
us
you
would
have
known
that
your
ingenious
project
could
never
be
carried
into
execution
if
i
observed
it
bulderent
would
not
and
if
he
observed
it
i
verily
believe
i
could
not
and
thus
you
see
the
thing
is
altogether
impracticable
as
one
soon
tires
of
preaching
to
the
winds
the
brahmin
contented
himself
with
asking
his
new
acquaintance
to
think
more
on
the
subject
at
his
leisure
and
we
proceeded
on
our
walk

dangerously
after

had
gone

was

by

short
and
for
the
right
hand
as
well
as
the
left
in
the
act
of
opening
it
was
made
to
crush
certain
berries
and
the
oil
they
yielded
was
carried
by
a
small
duct
to
the
hinge
which
was
thus
made
to
turn
easily
and
was
prevented
from
creaking
while
we
were
admiring
its
mechanism
an
elderly
man
rather
plainly
dressed
on
a
zebra
in
low
condition
rode
up
and
showed
that
he
was
the
owner
of
the
mansion
to
which
the
gate
belonged
and
that
he
was
not
displeased
with
the
curiosity
we
manifested
we
found
him
both
intelligent
and
obliging
he
informed
us
that
he
was
an
experimental
farmer
and
when
he
learnt
that
we
were
strangers
and
anxious
to
inform
ourselves
of
the
state
of
agriculture
in
the
country
he
very
civilly
invited
us
to
take
our
next
meal
with
him
our
walk
having
now
made
us
hungry
and
fatigued
we
gladly
accepted
of
his
hospitality
whereupon
he
alighted
and
walked
with
us
to
his
lodgings
he
was
very
communicative
of
his
modes
of
cultivation
and
management
but
chiefly
prided
himself
on
his
success
in
improving
the
size
of
his
cattle
he
informed
us
that
he
had
devoted
sixteen
years
of
his
life
to
this
object
and
had
then
in
his
a
buffalo
nearly
as
heavy
as
three
of
the
ordinary
size
his
practice
was
to
kill
all
the
young
animals
which
were
not
uncommonly
large
and
thrifty
to
cram
those
he
kept
with
as
much
food
as
they
would
eat
and
to
tempt
their
appetites
by
the
variety
of
their
nourishment
as
well
as
of
the
modes
of
preparing
it
all
this
said
he
costs
a
great
deal
it
is
true
but
i
am
paid
for
it
by
the
additional
price
i
was
struck
with
this
notable
triumph
of
industry
and
skill
in
the
goodly
art
of
husbandry
that
art
which
i
venerate
above
every
other
and
i
was
all
anxiety
to
receive
from
him
some
instructions
which
i
might
in
case
i
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
get
safely
back
communicate
to
my
friends
on
who
had
never
been
able
even
to
double
the
common
size
and
who
boasted
greatly
of
that
but
a
hesitating
look
and
a
few
inquiries
on
the
part
of
my
sly
friend
checked
my
enthusiasm
have
you
always
he
asked
had
the
same
number
of
acres
in
grain
and
grass
under
your
new
and
old
system
pretty
nearly
says
the
other
my
new
breed
however
though
fewer
consume
more
than
their
predecessors
how
many
head
did
you
formerly
sell
in
a
year
about
thirty
how
many
do
you
now
sell
though
for
some
years
i
have
not
sold
more
than
nine
or
ten
i
expect
to
exceed
that
number
in
another
year
which
you
expect
will
yield
you
more
than
the
thirty
did
formerly
certainly
because
such
meat
as
mine
commands
an
extraordinary
price
so
long
replied
the
brahmin
as
this
is
novelty
you
may
receive
a
part
of
the
price
which
men
are
ever
ready
to
pay
for
it
but
as
soon
as
others
profit
by
your
example
your
meat
falls
to
the
ordinary
rate
and
then
if
i
understand
you
aright
as
you
will
have
somewhat
less
in
quantity
than
you
formerly
had
your
gross
receipts
will
be
less
to
say
nothing
of
your
additional
labour
and
expense
but
who
has
the
skill
quickly
rejoined
the
other
of
which
i
can
boast
and
who
would
take
the
same
trouble
although
they
had
the
skill
but
stop
here
a
moment
said
our
host
till
i
go
to
see
how
my
last
improved
is
relished
by
my
cattle
the
brahmin
then
turning
to
me
said
this
gentleman
may
indeed
improve
his
fortune
by
the
business
of
a
grazier
but
the
same
pains
and
unremitting
attention
would
always
be
sure
of
a
liberal
reward
though
the
system
on
which
they
were
exerted
was
not
among
the
best
nothing
my
dear
atterley
is
more
true
than
the
saying
of
your
wise
book
all
flesh
is
grass
and
it
always
takes
the
same
quantity
of
one
to
make
a
given
quantity
of
the
other
whether
that
given
quantity
may
be
in
the
form
of
a
single
individual
or
two
or
three
but
in
the
former
case
great
labour
is
required
to
force
nature
beyond
her
ordinary
limits
and
the
same
labour
must
be
unceasingly
kept
up
or
she
will
certainly
relapse
to
her
original
dimensions
this
system
may
do
as
our
host
here
tells
us
it
actually
does
for
the
moon
but
it
is
not
suited
to
our
earth
if
however
you
are
ambitious
of
a
name
among
the
speculative
men
of
your
country
this
little
stone
added
he
stooping
and
picking
up
a
small
stone
from
the
ground
will
answer
your
purpose
quite
as
well
as
any
improvement
in
husbandry
it
is
precisely
of
the
same
species
as
those
which
we
threw
over
in
our
aerial
voyages
and
which
though
correctly
called
by
the
vulgar
who
are
oftener
right
than
the
learned
suppose
some
of
the
western
philosophers
declared
to
have
been
gravitated
in
the
atmosphere
and
is
this
really
the
origin
said
i
of
that
strange
phenomenon
which
has
furnished
so
much
matter
of
speculation
to
the
sages
both
of
europe
and
america
nothing
is
more
true
replied
he
these
stones
are
common
to
the
earth
and
to
the
moon
and
some
of
those
which
have
been
so
carefully
analyzed
by
your
most
celebrated
chemists
and
pronounced
different
from
any
known
mineral
production
of
the
earth
were
small
fragments
of
a
very
common
rock
in
the
mountains
of
burma
in
our
first
voyages
we
had
taken
some
of
them
with
us
as
ballast
and
those
which
we
first
threw
over
we
afterwards
learnt
from
the
public
journals
fell
in
france
some
of
the
others
fell
in
india
but
the
greater
number
in
the
ocean
those
which
have
fallen
at
other
times
have
been
real
fossils
of
the
moon
and
either
such
stones
as
this
i
hold
in
my
hand
or
such
metallic
substances
as
are
repelled
from
that
body
and
attracted
towards
the
earth
and
it
is
the
force
with
which
they
strike
the
earth
which
first
suggested
the
idea
of
a
our
party
were
greatly
amused
at
the
disputations
of
a
learned
society
in
europe
in
which
they
undertook
to
give
a
mathematical
demonstration
that
they
could
not
be
thrown
from
a
volcano
of
the
earth
nor
from
the
moon
but
were
suddenly
formed
in
the
atmosphere
i
should
as
soon
believe
that
a
loaf
of
bread
could
be
made
and
baked
in
the
atmosphere
finding
that
our
landlord
prided
himself
on
his
interior
management
as
well
as
on
that
without
doors
we
expressed
a
wish
to
see
some
of
his
household
improvements
he
readily
consented
and
conducted
us
at
once
into
his
kitchen
and
showed
us
inventions
and
contrivances
out
of
number
for
saving
fuel
and
meat
and
labour
in
short
for
saving
every
thing
but
money
the
large
room
into
which
he
carried
us
appeared
as
a
vast
laboratory
from
the
infinite
variety
of
pots
pans
skillets
knives
forks
ladles
mortars
sieves
funnels
and
other
utensils
of
metal
glass
pottery
and
wood
the
steam
which
he
used
for
cooking
was
carried
along
a
pipe
under
a
succession
of
kettles
and
boilers
descending
in
regular
gradation
by
which
a
great
saving
of
fuel
was
effected
and
to
perfect
this
part
of
the
apparatus
the
pipe
could
be
removed
to
give
place
to
one
of
the
size
suited
to
the
occasion
his
pipe
was
now
in
use
the
wood
which
was
all
cut
to
the
same
length
and
channelled
out
to
admit
the
free
passage
of
the
air
was
then
duly
placed
in
the
stove
and
set
on
fire
but
the
heat
not
passing
very
readily
through
all
the
sinuosities
of
the
pipe
he
ordered
his
head
cook
to
screw
on
his
exhauster
the
man
in
less
than
ten
minutes
unscrewed
a
plate
at
the
farther
end
and
fixed
on
an
made
for
the
purpose
on
which
the
door
of
the
stove
suddenly
slammed
to
our
host
saw
the
accident
and
hurrying
to
open
the
stove
fell
over
a
heap
of
channelled
logs
and
cut
a
gash
in
his
forehead
the
cook
ran
to
help
him
up
and
after
he
was
on
his
legs
and
his
forehead
wiped
the
stove
was
opened
when
the
fire
which
had
been
deprived
of
its
aliment
was
entirely
extinguished
i
thought
he
was
hardly
sorry
for
the
accident
as
it
afforded
him
an
occasion
of
showing
how
ingeniously
he
kindled
a
fire
he
had
an
electric
machine
brought
to
him
by
means
of
which
he
set
fire
to
a
few
grains
of
gunpowder
this
lighted
some
tinder
which
again
ignited
spirits
whose
blaze
reached
the
lower
extremity
of
his
lamp
taking
the
precaution
of
keeping
the
stove
open
this
time
the
air
was
again
exhausted
at
the
farther
end
of
the
pipe
and
in
a
little
time
the
flame
was
seen
to
ascend
even
to
the
and
to
scorch
the
parts
made
of
wood
whereupon
i
saw
a
glow
of
triumph
on
his
face
which
amply
compensated
him
for
his
wound
and
vexation
there
was
a
grand
machine
for
roasting
that
carried
the
fire
round
the
meat
the
juices
of
which
he
said
by
a
rotary
motion
would
be
thrown
to
the
surface
and
either
evaporate
or
be
deteriorated
here
was
also
his
digestor
for
making
soup
of
rams
horns
which
he
assured
me
contained
a
good
deal
of
nourishment
and
the
only
difficulty
was
in
extracting
it
he
next
showed
us
his
which
received
the
smoke
near
the
top
of
the
chimney
and
brought
it
down
to
be
burnt
over
again
by
which
he
computed
that
he
saved
five
cords
and
a
half
of
wood
in
a
year
the
fire
which
dressed
his
victuals
pumped
up
by
means
of
a
steam
engine
water
for
the
kitchen
turned
one
or
more
spits
as
well
as
two
or
three
mills
for
grinding
pepper
salt
and
then
by
a
spindle
through
the
wall
worked
a
churn
in
the
dairy
and
cleaned
the
knives
the
forks
indeed
were
still
cleaned
by
hand
but
he
said
he
did
not
despair
of
effecting
this
operation
in
time
by
machinery
i
mentioned
to
him
our
contrivance
of
silver
forks
to
lessen
this
labour
but
he
coldly
remarked
that
he
imagined
science
was
in
its
infancy
with
us
he
informed
us
that
he
had
been
ten
years
in
completing
this
ingenious
machine
and
certainly
when
it
was
in
full
operation
i
never
saw
exultation
and
delight
so
strongly
depicted
in
any
human
face
the
various
sounds
and
sights
that
met
the
ear
and
eye
in
rapid
succession
still
farther
worked
on
his
feelings
and
heightened
his
raptures
there
was
such
a
simmering
and
hissing
and
bubbling
of
boiled
and
broiled
and
fried
such
a
whirling
and
jerking
and
creaking
of
wheels
and
cranks
and
pistons
such
clouds
of
steam
and
vapours
and
even
smoke
notwithstanding
all
of
the
latter
that
was
burnt
that
i
almost
thought
myself
in
some
great
manufactory
after
having
suffered
as
much
as
we
could
well
bear
from
the
heat
and
confined
air
of
this
laboratory
of
eatables
and
passed
the
proper
number
of
compliments
on
the
skill
and
ingenuity
they
displayed
we
ascended
to
his
hall
to
partake
of
that
feast
to
prepare
which
we
had
seen
all
the
elements
and
the
mechanical
powers
called
into
action
there
were
a
few
of
his
city
acquaintances
present
besides
ourselves
but
whether
it
was
owing
to
the
effect
of
the
steam
from
the
dishes
on
our
stomachs
or
that
this
scientific
cookery
was
not
suited
to
our
unpractised
palates
i
know
not
but
we
all
made
an
indifferent
repast
except
our
host
who
tasted
every
dish
and
seemed
to
relish
them
all
after
sitting
some
time
at
table
conversing
on
the
progress
of
science
its
splendid
achievements
and
the
pleasing
prospects
which
it
yet
dimly
showed
in
the
future
our
hospitable
entertainer
perceiving
we
were
fatigued
with
the
labours
of
the
day
invited
us
to
take
our
next
or
sleep
with
him
for
which
hospitality
we
felt
very
grateful
we
were
then
shown
to
a
room
in
which
there
were
marks
of
the
same
fertile
invention
in
saving
labour
and
promoting
convenience
but
we
were
too
sleepy
to
take
much
notice
of
them
our
beds
were
filled
with
air
which
is
quite
as
good
as
feathers
except
that
when
the
leather
covering
gets
a
hole
in
it
from
ripping
or
other
accidents
it
loses
its
elasticity
with
its
air
an
accident
which
happened
to
me
this
very
night
for
a
mouse
having
gnawed
the
leather
where
the
greasy
fingers
had
left
a
mark
i
sunk
gently
down
not
to
soft
repose
but
on
the
hard
planks
where
i
uncomfortably
lay
until
the
bell
warned
us
to
rise
for
breakfast
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
walked
out
into
a
large
garden
and
as
the
sun
was
not
yet
so
high
as
to
make
it
sultry
was
enjoying
the
balmy
sweetness
of
the
air
and
the
flowering
shrubs
which
in
beauty
and
fragrance
almost
exceeded
those
of
india
when
i
saw
a
servant
run
by
the
garden
wall
enter
the
stable
and
bring
out
a
zebra
on
inquiring
the
cause
i
was
made
to
understand
that
our
noble
host
was
taken
suddenly
ill
i
immediately
returned
to
the
house
and
found
the
domestics
running
to
and
fro
and
manifesting
the
greatest
anxiety
as
well
as
hurry
in
their
looks
i
went
into
the
brahmin
room
and
found
him
dressed
he
went
out
and
after
some
time
informed
me
that
our
kind
host
had
a
violent
in
consequence
of
the
various
kinds
of
food
with
which
he
had
overloaded
his
stomach
at
dinner
that
he
considered
himself
near
his
last
end
and
was
endeavouring
to
arrange
his
affairs
for
the
event
i
could
not
help
meditating
on
the
melancholy
uncertainty
of
human
life
when
i
contrasted
the
comforts
the
pleasures
the
pride
of
conscious
usefulness
and
genius
felt
by
this
gentleman
a
short
time
since
with
the
agony
which
that
trying
and
bitter
hour
brings
to
the
stoutest
and
most
callous
heart
when
it
must
quit
this
state
of
being
for
another
of
which
it
knows
so
little
and
over
which
fear
and
doubt
throw
a
gloom
that
hope
can
not
entirely
dispel
chapter
xi
physicians
their
consultation
while
they
dispute
the
patient
recovers
the
travellers
visit
the
celebrated
teacher
lozzi
while
i
indulged
in
these
sad
meditations
and
felt
for
my
host
while
i
felt
no
less
for
myself
i
saw
the
physician
approach
who
had
been
sent
for
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
quick
step
a
lively
piercing
eye
a
sallow
complexion
and
very
courteous
manners
and
always
willing
to
display
the
ready
flow
of
words
for
which
he
was
remarkable
i
felt
great
curiosity
to
witness
the
skill
of
this
lunar
aesculapius
and
he
was
evidently
pleased
with
the
interest
i
manifested
it
turned
out
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
brahmin
and
learning
from
the
latter
my
wish
he
conducted
me
into
the
room
of
our
sick
host
we
found
him
lying
on
a
straw
bed
and
strangely
altered
within
a
few
hours
the
physician
after
feeling
his
pulse
which
as
every
country
has
its
peculiar
customs
is
done
here
about
the
temples
and
neck
instead
of
the
wrist
after
examining
his
tongue
his
teeth
his
water
and
feces
proposed
bleeding
we
all
walked
to
the
door
and
ventured
to
oppose
the
doctor
prescription
suggesting
that
the
copious
evacuations
he
had
already
experienced
might
make
bleeding
useless
if
not
dangerous
how
little
like
a
man
of
sense
you
speak
said
the
other
how
readily
you
have
chimed
in
with
the
prejudices
of
the
vulgar
i
should
have
expected
better
things
from
you
but
the
sway
of
empiricism
is
destined
yet
to
have
a
long
struggle
before
it
receives
its
final
overthrow
i
have
attacked
it
with
success
in
many
quarters
but
when
it
has
been
prostrated
in
one
place
it
soon
rises
up
in
another
have
you
my
good
friend
seen
my
last
essay
on
morbid
action
the
brahmin
replied
that
he
had
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
meeting
with
it
i
am
sorry
you
have
not
said
the
other
i
have
there
completely
demonstrated
that
disease
is
an
unit
and
that
it
is
the
extreme
of
folly
to
divide
diseases
into
classes
which
tend
but
to
produce
confusion
of
ideas
and
an
unscientific
practice
sir
continued
he
in
a
more
animated
tone
there
is
a
beautiful
simplicity
in
this
theory
which
gives
us
assurance
of
its
conformity
to
nature
and
truth
it
needs
but
to
be
seen
to
be
understood
but
to
be
understood
to
be
approved
and
carried
into
successful
operation
the
brahmin
asked
him
if
this
unit
did
not
present
different
symptoms
on
different
occasions
certainly
he
replied
from
too
much
or
too
little
action
in
this
set
of
vessels
or
that
it
is
differently
modified
and
must
be
treated
accordingly
this
unit
then
said
my
friend
assumes
different
forms
and
requires
various
remedies
is
there
not
then
a
convenience
in
separating
these
modifications
or
if
you
prefer
it
from
one
another
by
different
names
stop
my
friend
you
do
not
apprehend
the
matter
i
will
explain
at
this
moment
two
other
gentlemen
of
a
grave
aspect
and
demeanour
entered
the
room
they
also
were
physicians
of
great
reputation
in
the
city
they
appeared
to
be
formal
and
reserved
towards
one
another
but
they
each
manifested
still
more
shyness
and
coldness
towards
the
learned
shuro
they
entered
the
sick
chamber
and
having
informed
themselves
of
the
state
of
the
patient
all
three
withdrew
to
a
consultation
they
had
not
been
long
together
before
their
voices
grew
from
a
whisper
so
loud
that
we
could
distinctly
hear
all
they
said
sir
says
shakrack
the
patient
is
in
a
state
of
direct
debility
we
must
stimulate
if
we
would
restore
a
healthy
action
pour
in
the
and
and
my
life
for
it
the
patient
is
saved
will
you
listen
to
me
for
one
moment
says
dridrano
the
youngest
of
the
three
gentlemen
it
may
be
presumption
for
one
of
my
humble
pretensions
to
set
myself
in
opposition
to
persons
of
your
age
experience
and
celebrity
but
i
am
bound
by
the
sacred
duties
of
the
high
functions
i
have
undertaken
to
perform
to
use
my
poor
abilities
in
such
a
way
as
i
can
to
advance
the
noble
science
of
medicine
and
in
so
doing
to
give
strength
to
the
weak
courage
to
the
disheartened
and
comfort
to
the
afflicted
gentlemen
i
say
i
hope
if
my
simple
views
should
be
found
widely
different
from
yours
you
will
not
impute
it
to
a
presumption
which
is
as
foreign
to
my
nature
as
it
would
be
unsuited
to
your
merits
i
consider
the
human
body
a
mere
machine
whose
parts
are
complicated
whose
functions
are
various
and
whose
operations
are
liable
to
be
impeded
and
frustrated
by
a
variety
of
obstacles
there
is
you
know
one
set
of
tubes
or
vessels
for
the
blood
another
for
the
lymph
another
for
the
sweat
and
so
on
now
although
each
of
these
fluids
has
its
several
channels
yet
if
by
any
accident
any
one
of
them
is
obstructed
and
there
is
so
great
an
accumulation
of
the
obstructed
fluid
that
it
can
not
find
vent
by
its
natural
channel
or
duct
then
you
must
carry
off
the
redundancy
by
some
other
for
you
well
know
that
that
which
can
be
carried
off
by
one
can
be
carried
off
by
all
gentlemen
i
beg
you
not
to
turn
away
hear
me
for
a
moment
then
if
the
current
of
the
blood
be
obstructed
i
make
large
draughts
of
urine
or
sweat
or
saliva
or
of
the
liquor
amnii
and
i
find
it
matters
little
which
of
these
evacuants
i
resort
to
this
system
to
which
with
deference
to
your
longer
experience
i
have
had
the
honour
of
giving
some
celebrity
in
morosofia
explains
how
it
is
that
such
various
remedies
for
the
same
disease
have
been
in
vogue
at
different
times
they
have
all
had
in
town
able
advocates
i
could
adduce
undeniable
testimonials
of
their
efficacy
because
in
fact
they
are
all
efficacious
and
it
seems
to
me
a
mere
matter
of
earthshine
whether
we
resort
to
one
or
the
other
mode
of
restoring
the
equilibrium
of
the
human
machine
all
that
we
have
to
do
being
to
know
when
and
to
what
extent
it
is
proper
to
use
either
determine
then
gentlemen
you
for
whose
maturer
judgment
and
years
i
feel
profound
respect
whether
we
shall
blister
or
sweat
or
bleed
or
salivate
shuro
who
had
manifested
his
impatience
at
this
long
harangue
by
frequent
interruptions
and
which
dridrano
show
of
deference
could
scarcely
keep
down
hastily
replied
you
have
manifestly
taken
the
hint
of
your
theory
from
me
and
because
i
have
advanced
the
doctrine
that
disease
is
an
unit
you
come
forward
now
and
insist
that
remedy
is
an
unit
too
you
do
me
great
honour
learned
sir
said
dridrano
surely
it
would
be
very
unbecoming
in
one
of
my
age
and
standing
to
set
up
a
theory
in
opposition
to
yours
but
it
would
be
yet
more
discreditable
to
be
a
plagiarist
and
with
all
due
respect
for
your
superior
wisdom
it
does
seem
to
my
feeble
intellect
that
no
two
theories
can
be
more
different
you
use
several
remedies
for
one
disease
i
admit
several
diseases
and
use
one
remedy
and
does
not
darkness
remind
us
of
light
replied
shuro
by
the
contrast
heat
of
cold
north
of
south
gentlemen
then
said
shakrack
who
had
been
walking
to
and
fro
during
the
preceding
controversy
as
you
seem
to
agree
so
ill
with
each
other
i
trust
you
will
unite
in
adopting
my
course
let
us
begin
with
this
cordial
we
will
then
vary
the
stimulus
if
necessary
by
means
of
the
elixir
and
you
will
see
the
salutary
effects
immediately
a
loss
of
blood
would
still
farther
increase
the
debility
of
the
patient
and
i
appeal
to
your
candour
shuro
whether
you
ever
practised
venesection
in
such
a
case
in
such
a
case
ay
in
what
would
call
much
worse
i
was
not
long
since
called
in
to
a
man
in
a
dropsy
i
opened
a
vein
he
seemed
from
that
moment
to
feel
relief
and
he
so
far
recovered
that
after
a
short
time
i
bled
him
again
i
returned
the
next
day
and
had
i
arrived
half
an
hour
sooner
i
should
have
bled
him
a
third
time
and
in
all
human
probability
have
saved
his
life
if
you
had
stimulated
him
you
might
have
had
an
opportunity
of
making
your
favourite
experiment
a
little
oftener
said
shakrack
you
are
facetious
sir
i
imagine
you
have
been
using
your
own
panacea
somewhat
too
freely
not
so
said
his
opponent
angrily
but
if
you
are
not
more
guarded
in
your
expressions
i
shall
make
use
of
yours
in
a
way
you
wo
like
upon
which
they
proceeded
to
blows
dridrano
all
the
while
bellowing
i
beg
my
worthy
seniors
for
the
honour
of
science
that
you
will
forbear
the
noise
of
the
dispute
had
waked
the
patient
who
learning
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
calmly
begged
they
would
give
themselves
no
concern
about
him
but
let
him
die
in
peace
the
domestics
who
had
been
for
some
time
listening
to
the
dispute
on
hearing
the
scuffle
ran
in
and
parted
the
angry
combatants
who
like
an
abscess
just
lanced
were
giving
vent
to
all
the
malignant
humours
that
had
been
so
long
silently
gathering
in
the
mean
while
the
smooth
and
considerate
dridrano
stept
into
the
sick
room
with
the
view
of
offering
an
apology
for
the
unmannerly
conduct
of
his
brethren
and
of
tendering
his
single
services
as
the
other
sages
of
the
healing
art
could
not
agree
in
the
course
to
be
pursued
when
he
found
that
the
patient
profiting
by
the
simple
remedies
of
the
brahmin
and
an
hour
rest
had
been
so
much
refreshed
that
he
considered
himself
out
of
danger
and
that
he
had
no
need
of
medical
assistance
or
at
any
rate
he
was
unwilling
to
follow
the
prescriptions
of
one
physician
which
another
if
not
two
others
unhesitatingly
condemned
each
one
then
received
his
fee
and
hurried
home
to
publish
his
own
statement
of
the
case
in
a
pamphlet
the
brahmin
who
had
never
left
the
sick
man
couch
during
his
sleep
now
that
he
was
out
of
danger
was
greatly
diverted
at
the
dispute
but
he
added
that
notwithstanding
the
ridiculous
figure
they
had
that
day
made
they
were
all
men
of
genius
and
ability
but
had
done
their
parts
injustice
by
their
vanity
and
the
ambition
of
originating
a
new
theory
with
all
the
extravagance
said
he
to
which
they
push
their
several
systems
they
are
not
unsuccessful
in
practice
for
habitual
caution
and
an
instinctive
regard
for
human
life
which
they
never
can
extinguish
checks
them
in
carrying
their
hypotheses
into
execution
and
if
i
might
venture
to
give
an
opinion
on
a
subject
of
which
i
know
so
little
and
there
is
so
much
to
be
known
i
would
say
that
the
most
common
error
of
theorists
is
to
consider
man
as
a
machine
rather
than
an
animal
and
subject
to
one
set
of
the
laws
of
matter
rather
than
as
subject
to
them
all
thus
he
continued
we
have
been
regarded
by
one
class
of
theorists
as
an
hydraulic
engine
composed
of
various
tubes
fitted
with
their
several
fluids
the
laws
and
functions
of
which
have
been
deduced
from
calculations
of
velocities
altitudes
diameters
friction
another
class
considered
man
as
a
mere
chemical
engine
and
his
stomach
as
an
alembic
the
doctrine
of
affinities
attractions
and
repulsions
now
had
full
play
then
came
the
notion
of
sympathies
and
antipathies
by
which
name
unknown
and
unknowable
causes
were
sought
to
be
explained
and
ignorance
was
cunningly
veiled
in
mystery
but
the
science
will
never
be
in
the
right
tract
of
improvement
until
we
consider
conjointly
the
mechanical
operations
of
the
fluids
the
chemical
agency
of
the
substances
taken
into
the
stomach
and
the
animal
functions
of
digestion
secretion
and
absorption
as
evinced
by
actual
observation
i
told
him
that
i
believed
that
was
now
the
course
which
was
actually
pursued
in
the
best
medical
schools
both
of
europe
and
america
our
worthy
host
though
very
feeble
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
dress
himself
and
receive
the
congratulations
of
his
household
who
had
all
manifested
a
concern
for
his
situation
that
was
at
once
creditable
to
him
and
themselves
expressing
our
gratitude
for
his
kind
attentions
and
promising
to
renew
our
visit
if
we
could
we
bade
him
adieu
we
took
a
different
road
home
from
the
way
we
had
come
and
had
not
walked
far
before
we
met
a
number
of
small
boys
each
having
a
bag
on
his
back
as
large
as
he
could
stagger
under
surprised
at
seeing
children
of
their
tender
years
thus
prematurely
put
to
severe
labour
i
was
about
to
rail
at
the
absurd
custom
of
this
strange
country
when
my
friend
checked
me
for
my
hasty
judgment
and
told
me
that
these
boys
were
on
their
way
to
school
after
their
usual
monthly
holiday
we
attended
them
to
their
schoolhouse
which
stood
in
sight
on
the
side
of
a
steep
chalky
hill
the
brahmin
told
me
that
the
teacher
name
was
lozzi
pozzi
and
that
he
had
acquired
great
celebrity
by
his
system
of
instruction
when
the
boys
opened
their
bags
i
found
that
instead
of
books
and
provisions
as
i
had
expected
they
were
filled
with
sticks
which
they
told
us
constituted
the
arithmetical
lessons
they
were
required
to
practise
at
home
these
sticks
were
of
different
lengths
and
dimensions
according
to
the
number
marked
on
them
so
that
by
looking
at
the
inscription
you
could
tell
the
size
or
by
seeing
or
feeling
the
size
you
could
tell
the
number
the
master
now
made
his
appearance
and
learning
our
errand
was
very
communicative
he
descanted
on
the
advantages
of
this
manual
and
ocular
mode
of
teaching
the
science
of
numbers
and
gave
us
practical
illustrations
of
its
efficacy
by
examining
his
pupils
in
our
presence
he
told
the
first
boy
he
called
up
and
who
did
not
seem
to
be
more
than
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
to
add
and
together
and
tell
him
the
result
the
little
fellow
set
about
hunting
with
great
alacrity
over
his
bag
until
he
found
a
piece
divided
like
three
fingers
then
a
piece
with
five
divisions
and
lastly
one
with
seven
and
putting
them
side
by
side
he
found
the
piece
of
a
correspondent
length
and
thus
in
less
than
eight
minutes
and
a
half
answered
fifteen
the
ingenious
master
then
exercised
another
boy
in
subtraction
and
a
third
in
multiplication
but
the
latter
was
thrown
into
great
confusion
for
one
of
the
pieces
having
lost
a
division
it
led
him
to
a
wrong
result
the
teacher
informed
us
that
he
taught
geometry
in
the
same
way
and
had
even
extended
it
to
grammar
logic
rhetoric
and
the
art
of
composition
the
rules
of
syntax
were
discovered
by
pieces
of
wood
interlocking
with
each
other
in
squares
dovetails
after
the
manner
of
geographical
cards
and
as
they
chanced
to
fit
together
so
was
the
concordance
between
the
several
parts
of
speech
ascertained
the
machine
for
composition
occupied
a
large
space
different
sets
of
synonymes
were
arranged
in
compartments
of
various
sizes
when
the
subject
was
familiar
a
short
piece
was
used
when
it
was
stately
or
heroic
then
the
longest
slips
that
could
be
found
were
resorted
to
those
that
were
rounded
at
the
ends
were
mellifluous
the
jagged
ones
were
harsh
the
thick
pieces
expressed
force
and
vigour
where
the
curves
corresponded
at
one
end
they
served
for
alliteration
and
when
at
the
other
they
answered
for
rhyme
by
way
of
proving
its
progress
he
showed
us
a
composition
by
a
man
who
was
deaf
and
dumb
in
praise
of
morosofia
who
merely
by
the
use
of
his
eyes
and
hands
had
made
an
ingenious
and
piece
of
eloquence
though
i
confess
that
the
sense
was
somewhat
obscure
we
went
away
filled
with
admiration
for
the
great
lozzi
pozzi
inventions
having
understood
that
there
was
an
academy
in
the
neighbourhood
in
which
youths
of
maturer
years
were
instructed
in
the
fine
arts
we
were
induced
to
visit
it
but
there
being
a
vacation
at
that
time
we
could
see
neither
the
professors
nor
students
and
consequently
could
gain
little
information
of
the
course
of
discipline
and
instruction
pursued
there
we
were
however
conducted
to
a
small
attached
to
the
institution
by
its
keeper
where
the
habits
and
accomplishments
of
the
animals
bore
strong
testimony
in
favour
of
the
diligence
and
skill
of
their
teachers
we
there
saw
two
which
so
far
from
fighting
though
they
had
been
selected
from
the
most
approved
breed
billed
and
cooed
like
there
was
a
large
zebra
apparently
which
showed
his
anger
by
running
at
and
butting
every
animal
that
came
in
his
way
two
llamas
which
are
naturally
as
quiet
and
timid
as
sheep
bit
each
other
very
furiously
until
they
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
lastly
a
large
mastiff
made
his
appearance
walking
in
a
slow
measured
gait
with
a
sleek
cat
on
his
back
and
she
in
turn
was
surmounted
by
a
mouse
which
formed
the
apex
of
this
singular
pyramid
the
keeper
remarking
our
unaffected
surprise
at
the
exhibition
asked
us
if
we
could
now
doubt
the
unlimited
force
of
education
after
such
a
display
of
the
triumph
of
art
over
nature
while
he
was
speaking
the
mastiff
being
jostled
by
the
two
llamas
still
awkwardly
worrying
each
other
turned
round
so
suddenly
that
the
mouse
was
dislodged
from
his
lofty
position
and
thrown
to
the
ground
on
seeing
which
the
cat
immediately
sprang
upon
it
with
a
loud
purring
noise
which
being
heard
by
the
dog
he
with
a
fierce

the
llamas
alarmed
at
this
terrific
sound
instinctively
ran
off
and
having
in
their
flight
approached
the
heels
of
the
zebra
he
gave
a
kick
which
killed
one
of
them
on
the
spot
the
keeper
who
was
deeply
mortified
at
seeing
the
fabric
he
had
raised
with
such
indefatigable
labour
overturned
in
a
moment
protested
that
nothing
of
the
sort
had
ever
happened
before
to
which
we
replied
by
way
of
consolation
that
perhaps
the
same
thing
might
never
happen
again
and
that
while
his
art
had
achieved
a
conquest
over
nature
this
was
only
a
slight
rebellion
of
nature
against
art
we
then
thanked
him
for
his
politeness

of

singular
institution
of
the

boys
the
domestic
when
we
got
back
to
the
city
we
found
an
unusual
stir
and
bustle
among
the
citizens
and
on
inquiring
the
cause
we
understood
they
were
about
to
elect
the
after
taking
some
refreshment
at
our
lodgings
where
we
were
very
kindly
received
we
again
went
out
and
were
hurried
along
with
the
crowd
to
a
large
building
near
the
centre
of
the
city
the
multitude
were
shouting
and
hallooing
with
great
vehemence
the
brahmin
remarking
an
elderly
man
who
seemed
very
quiet
in
the
midst
of
all
this
ferment
he
thought
him
a
proper
person
to
address
for
information
i
suppose
says
he
from
the
violence
of
these
partisans
they
are
on
different
sides
in
religion
or
politics
not
at
all
said
the
other
those
differences
are
forgotten
at
the
present
and
the
ground
of
the
dispute
is
that
one
of
the
candidates
is
tall
and
the
other
is
short
one
has
a
large
foretop
and
the
other
is
bald
oh
i
forgot
one
has
been
a
schoolmaster
and
the
other
a
butcher
curiosity
now
prompted
me
to
enter
into
the
thickest
of
the
throng
and
i
had
never
seen
such
fury
in
the
maddest
contests
between
old
george
clinton
and
jay
or
de
witt
clinton
and
governor
tompkins
in
my
native
state
they
each
reproached
their
adversaries
in
the
coarsest
language
and
attributed
to
them
the
vilest
principles
and
motives
our
guide
farther
told
us
that
the
same
persons
with
two
others
had
been
candidates
last
year
when
the
schoolmaster
prevailed
and
as
the
supporters
of
the
other
two
unsuccessful
candidates
had
to
choose
now
between
the
remaining
two
each
party
was
perpetually
reproaching
the
other
with
inconsistency
a
dialogue
between
two
individuals
of
opposite
sides
which
we
happened
to
hear
will
serve
as
a
specimen
of
the
rest
are
you
not
a
pretty
fellow
to
vote
for
whom
you
have
so
often
called
rogue
and
blockhead
it
becomes
you
to
talk
of
consistency
indeed
pray
sir
how
does
it
happen
that
you
are
now
against
him
when
you
were
so
lately
sworn
friends
and
used
to
eat
out
of
the
same
dish
yes
but
i
was
the
butcher
friend
too
i
never
abused
him
never
catch
me
supporting
a
man
i
have
once
abused
but
i
catch
you
abusing
the
man
you
once
supported
which
is
rather
worse
the
difference
between
us
is
this
you
professed
to
be
friendly
to
both
i
professed
to
be
hostile
to
both
you
stuck
to
one
of
your
friends
and
cast
the
other
off
and
i
acted
the
same
towards
my
enemies
a
crowd
then
rushed
by
crying
huzza
for
the
knives
damn
pen
and
ink
damn
the
books
and
all
that
read
in
them
butchers
knives
and
beef
for
ever
we
asked
our
guide
what
these
men
were
to
gain
by
the
issue
of
the
contest
nineteenths
of
them
nothing
but
a
few
hope
to
be
made
deputies
if
their
candidates
succeed
and
they
therefore
egg
on
the
rest
we
drew
near
to
the
scaffold
where
the
candidates
stood
and
our
ears
were
deafened
with
the
mingled
shouts
and
exclamations
of
praise
and
reproach
you
cheated
the
corporation
says
one
you
killed
two
black
sheep
says
another
you
ca
read
a
warrant
you
let
dondon
cheat
you
you
tried
to
cheat
nincan
you
want
to
build
a
you
have
an
old
ewe
at
home
now
that
you
did
not
come
honestly
by
you
denied
your
own
hand
with
other
ribaldry
still
more
gross
and
indecent
but
the
most
singular
part
of
the
scene
was
a
number
of
little
boys
dressed
in
black
and
white
who
all
wore
badges
of
the
parties
to
which
they
belonged
and
were
provided
with
a
syringe
and
two
canteens
one
filled
with
and
the
other
with
a
black
liquid
of
a
very
offensive
smell
the
first
of
which
they
squirted
at
their
favourite
candidates
and
voters
and
the
last
on
those
of
the
opposite
party
they
were
drawn
up
in
a
line
and
seemed
to
be
under
regular
discipline
for
whenever
the
captain
of
the
band
gave
the
word
vilti
mindoc
they
discharged
the
dirty
liquid
from
their
syringes
and
when
he
said
vilti
goulgoul
they
filled
the
air
with
perfume
that
was
so
overpowering
as
sometimes
to
produce
sickness
the
little
fellows
would
between
whiles
as
if
to
keep
their
hands
in
use
the
black
squirts
against
one
another
but
they
often
gave
them
a
dash
of
the
at
the
same
time
i
wondered
to
see
men
submit
to
such
indignity
but
was
told
that
the
custom
had
the
sanction
of
time
that
these
boys
were
brought
up
in
the
church
and
were
regularly
trained
to
this
business
besides
added
my
informer
the
custom
is
not
without
its
use
for
it
points
out
the
candidates
at
once
to
a
stranger
and
especially
him
who
is
successful
those
being
always
the
most
blackened
who
are
the
most
popular
but
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
ludicrous
figure
that
the
candidates
and
some
of
the
voters
made
if
you
came
near
them
on
one
side
they
were
like
roses
dripping
with
the
morning
dew
but
on
the
other
they
were
as
black
as
chimney
sweeps
and
more
offensive
than
street
scavengers
as
these
syringe
boys
or
goulmins
are
thus
protected
by
custom
the
persons
assailed
affected
to
despise
them
but
i
could
ever
and
anon
see
some
of
the
most
active
partisans
clapping
them
on
the
back
and
saying
well
done
my
little
fellows
give
it
to
them
again
you
shall
have
a
and
you
shall
have
a
new
cap
surely
thought
i
our
custom
of
praising
and
abusing
our
public
men
in
the
newspapers
is
far
more
rational
than
this
after
the
novelty
of
the
scene
was
over
i
became
wearied
and
disgusted
with
their
coarseness
violence
and
want
of
decency
and
we
left
them
without
waiting
to
see
the
result
of
the
contest
in
returning
to
our
lodgings
the
brahmin
took
me
along
a
quarter
of
the
town
in
which
i
had
never
before
been
in
a
little
while
we
came
to
a
lofty
building
before
the
gate
of
which
a
great
crowd
were
assembled
this
said
my
companion
is
one
of
the
courts
of
justice
anxious
to
see
their
modes
of
proceeding
in
court
i
pushed
through
the
crowd
followed
by
the
brahmin
and
on
entering
the
building
found
myself
in
a
spacious
amphitheatre
in
the
middle
of
which
i
beheld
with
surprise
several
men
engaged
hand
to
hand
in
single
combat
on
asking
an
explanation
of
my
friend
he
informed
me
that
these
contests
were
favourite
modes
of
settling
private
disputes
in
morosofia
that
the
i
saw
hired
themselves
to
any
one
who
conceived
himself
injured
in
person
character
or
property
it
seems
a
strange
mode
of
settling
legal
disputes
i
remarked
which
determines
a
question
in
favour
of
a
party
according
to
the
strength
and
wind
of
his
champion
nor
is
that
all
said
the
brahmin
as
the
judges
assign
the
victory
according
to
certain
rules
and
precedents
the
reasons
of
which
are
known
only
to
themselves
if
known
at
all
and
which
are
often
sufficiently
whimsical
as
sometimes
a
small
scratch
in
the
head
avails
more
than
a
disabling
blow
in
the
body
the
blows
too
must
be
given
in
the
right
time
as
well
as
in
the
right
place
or
they
pass
for
nothing
in
short
of
all
those
spectators
who
are
present
to
witness
the
powers
and
address
of
the
not
one
in
a
hundred
can
tell
who
has
gained
the
victory
until
the
judges
have
proclaimed
it
i
presume
said
i
that
the
champions
who
thus
expose
their
persons
and
lives
in
the
cause
of
another
are
glonglims
there
said
he
you
are
altogether
mistaken
in
the
first
place
the
seldom
sustain
serious
injury
their
weapons
do
not
endanger
life
and
as
each
one
knows
that
his
adversary
is
merely
following
his
vocation
they
often
fight
without
animosity
after
the
contest
is
over
you
may
commonly
see
the
combatants
walking
and
talking
very
sociably
together
but
as
this
circumstance
makes
them
a
little
suspected
by
the
public
they
affect
the
greater
rage
when
in
conflict
and
occasionally
quarrel
and
fight
in
downright
earnest
no
he
continued
i
am
told
it
is
a
very
rare
thing
to
see
one
of
these
who
is
a
glonglim
but
most
of
their
employers
belong
to
this
unhappy
race
on
looking
more
attentively
i
perceived
many
of
these
beings
among
the
spectators
showing
by
their
gestures
the
greatest
anxiety
for
the
issue
of
the
contest
they
each
carried
a
scrip
or
bag
the
contents
of
which
they
ever
and
anon
gave
to
their
respective
champions
whose
wind
it
is
remarked
is
very
apt
to
fail
unless
thus
assisted
having
learnt
some
farther
particulars
respecting
this
singular
mode
of
litigation
which
would
be
uninteresting
to
the
general
reader
i
took
my
leave
not
without
secretly
congratulating
myself
on
the
more
rational
modes
in
which
justice
is
administered
on
earth
when
we
had
nearly
reached
our
lodgings
we
heard
a
violent
altercation
in
the
house
and
on
entering
we
found
our
landlord
and
his
wife
engaged
in
a
dispute
respecting
their
domestic
economy
and
they
both
made
earnest
appeals
to
my
companion
for
the
correctness
of
their
respective
opinions
the
old
man
was
in
favour
of
their
children
making
their
own
shoes
and
clothes
and
his
wife
insisted
that
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
stick
to
their
garden
and
dairy
with
the
proceeds
of
which
they
could
purchase
what
they
wanted
she
asserted
that
they
could
readily
sell
all
the
fruits
and
vegetables
they
could
raise
and
that
whilst
they
would
acquire
greater
skill
by
an
undivided
attention
to
one
thing
they
who
followed
the
business
of
tailors
shoemakers
and
seamstresses
would
in
like
manner
become
more
skilful
in
their
employments
and
consequently
be
able
to
work
at
a
cheaper
rate
she
farther
added
that
spinning
and
sewing
were
unhealthy
occupations
they
would
give
the
girls
the
habit
of
stooping
which
would
spoil
their
shapes
and
that
their
thoughts
would
be
more
likely
to
be
running
on
idle
and
dangerous
fancies
when
sitting
at
their
needles
than
when
engaged
in
more
active
occupations
this
dame
was
a
very
fluent
woman
and
she
spoke
with
the
confidence
that
consciousness
of
the
powers
of
disputation
commonly
inspires
she
went
on
enlarging
on
the
mischiefs
of
the
practice
she
condemned
and
by
insensible
gradations
so
magnified
them
that
at
last
she
clearly
made
out
that
there
was
no
surer
way
of
rendering
their
daughters
sickly
deformed
vicious
and
unchaste
than
to
set
them
about
making
their
own
clothes
after
she
had
ceased
which
she
did
under
a
persuasion
that
she
had
anticipated
and
refuted
every
argument
that
could
be
urged
in
opposition
to
her
doctrine
the
husband
with
an
emotion
of
anger
that
he
could
not
conceal
began
to
defend
his
opinion
he
said
as
to
the
greater
economy
of
his
plan
there
could
be
no
doubt
for
although
they
might
at
particular
times
make
more
by
gardening
than
they
could
save
by
spinning
or
sewing
yet
there
were
other
times
when
they
could
not
till
the
ground
and
when
of
course
if
they
did
not
sew
or
spin
they
would
be
idle
but
if
they
did
work
the
proceeds
would
be
clear
gain
he
said
he
did
not
wish
his
daughters
to
be
constantly
employed
in
making
clothes
nor
was
it
necessary
that
they
should
be
a
variety
of
other
occupations
equally
indispensable
claimed
their
attention
and
would
leave
but
a
comparatively
small
portion
of
time
for
needlework
that
in
thus
providing
themselves
with
employment
at
home
they
at
least
saved
the
time
of
going
backwards
and
forwards
and
were
spared
some
trips
to
market
for
the
sale
of
vegetables
to
pay
as
would
then
be
necessary
for
the
work
done
by
others
besides
the
tailor
who
was
most
convenient
to
them
and
who
it
was
admitted
was
a
very
good
one
was
insolent
and
capricious
would
sometimes
extort
extravagant
prices
or
turn
them
into
ridicule
and
occasionally
went
so
far
as
to
set
his
upon
them
of
which
he
kept
a
great
number
he
declared
that
for
his
part
he
would
incur
a
little
more
expense
rather
than
he
would
be
so
imposed
upon
and
subjected
to
so
much
indignity
and
vexation
he
denied
that
sewing
would
affect
his
daughters
health
unless
perhaps
they
followed
it
exclusively
as
an
occupation
but
as
they
would
have
it
in
their
power
to
consult
their
inclinations
and
convenience
in
this
matter
they
might
take
it
up
when
the
occasion
required
and
lay
it
down
whenever
they
found
it
irksome
or
fatiguing
that
as
they
themselves
were
inclined
to
follow
this
course
it
was
a
plain
proof
that
the
occupation
was
not
unhealthy
he
maintained
that
they
would
stoop
just
as
much
in
gardening
and
washing
and
nursing
their
children
as
in
sewing
and
that
we
were
not
such
frail
or
unpliant
machines
as
to
be
seriously
injured
unless
we
persisted
in
one
set
of
straight
formal
notions
but
that
we
were
adapted
to
variety
and
were
benefited
by
it
that
as
to
the
practice
being
favourable
to
wantonness
and
vice
while
he
admitted
that
idleness
was
productive
of
these
effects
he
could
not
see
how
one
occupation
encouraged
them
more
than
another
that
the
tailor
for
example
whom
he
had
been
speaking
of
though
overbearing
and
rapacious
was
not
more
immoral
or
depraved
than
his
neighbours
and
had
probably
less
of
the
libertine
than
most
of
them
he
admitted
that
evil
thoughts
would
enter
the
mind
in
any
situation
and
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
kept
out
of
his
daughters
heads
being
as
he
said
but
women
yet
he
conceived
such
a
result
as
far
less
probable
if
they
were
suffered
to
ramble
about
in
the
streets
and
to
chaffer
with
their
customers
than
if
they
were
kept
to
sedate
and
diligent
employment
at
home
having
with
great
warmth
and
earnestness
used
these
arguments
he
concluded
by
plainly
hinting
to
his
wife
that
she
had
always
been
the
apologist
of
the
tailor
in
all
their
disputes
and
that
she
could
not
be
so
obstinately
blind
to
the
irrefragable
reasoning
he
had
urged
if
she
were
not
influenced
by
her
old
hankering
after
this
fellow
and
did
not
consult
his
interests
in
preference
to
those
of
her
own
family
upon
this
remark
the
old
woman
took
fire
and
in
spite
of
our
presence
they
both
had
recourse
to
direct
and
the
coarsest
abuse
the
brahmin
did
not
as
i
expected
join
me
in
laughing
at
the
scene
we
had
just
witnessed
but
after
some
musing
observed
there
is
much
truth
in
what
each
of
these
parties
say
i
blame
them
only
for
the
course
they
take
towards
each
other
their
dispute
is
in
fact
of
a
most
frivolous
and
unmeaning
character
for
if
the
father
was
to
carry
his
point
the
girls
would
occasionally
sell
the
productions
of
their
garden
and
pay
for
making
their
clothes
or
even
buy
them
ready
made
were
the
mother
on
the
other
hand
to
prevail
they
would
still
occasionally
use
their
needles
and
exercise
their
taste
and
skill
in
sewing
spinning
knitting
and
the
like
nay
added
he
if
you
had
not
been
so
much
engrossed
with
this
angry
and
indecorous
altercation
you
might
have
seen
two
of
them
at
their
needles
in
an
adjoining
apartment
while
one
was
busy
at
work
in
the
garden
and
another
up
to
the
elbows
in
the
all
so
closely
engaged
in
their
several
pursuits
that
they
hardly
seemed
to
know
they
were
the
subject
of
discussion
i
told
the
brahmin
that
a
dispute
not
unlike
this
had
taken
place
in
my
own
country
a
few
years
since
some
of
our
politicians
contending
that
agricultural
labour
was
most
conducive
to
the
national
wealth
whilst
others
maintained
that
manufacturing
industry
was
equally
advantageous
wherever
it
was
voluntarily
pursued
but
that
the
controversy
had
lately
assumed
a
different
character
the
question
now
being
not
whether
manufactures
are
as
beneficial
as
agriculture
but
whether
they
deserve
extraordinary
encouragement
by
taxing
those
who
do
not
give
them
a
preference
that
is
said
the
brahmin
as
if
our
landlady
by
way
of
inducing
her
daughters
to
give
up
gardening
for
spinning
were
to
tell
them
if
they
did
not
find
their
new
occupation
as
profitable
as
the
old
she
would
more
than
make
up
the
difference
out
of
her
own
pocket
which
though
it
might
suit
the
daughters
very
well
would
be
a
losing
business
to
the
family
chapter
xiii
of
the
happy
valley
the
laws
customs
and
manners
of
the
okalbians
theory
of
population
rent
system
of
the
brahmin
who
was
desirous
of
showing
me
what
was
most
remarkable
in
this
country
during
the
short
time
we
intended
to
stay
thought
this
a
favourable
time
to
visit
okalbia
or
the
happy
valley
the
okalbians
are
a
tribe
or
nation
who
live
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
lunar
world
and
whose
wise
government
prudence
industry
and
integrity
are
very
highly
extolled
by
all
though
by
what
i
can
learn
they
have
few
imitators
they
dwell
about
three
hundred
miles
north
of
the
city
of
alamatua
in
a
fertile
valley
which
they
obtained
by
purchase
about
two
hundred
years
since
and
which
is
about
equal
to
twenty
miles
square
that
is
to
four
hundred
square
miles
a
carriage
and
four
dogs
was
procured
for
us
and
we
soon
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
that
encloses
the
fortunate
valley
in
about
hours
we
then
ascended
for
about
three
miles
with
far
fatigue
than
i
formerly
experienced
in
climbing
the
catskill
mountains
of
my
native
state
and
found
ourselves
on
the
summit
of
an
extensive
ridge
which
formed
the
margin
of
a
vast
elliptical
basin
the
bottom
of
which
presented
a
most
beautiful
landscape
the
whole
surface
was
like
a
garden
interspersed
with
patches
of
wood
clumps
of
trees
and
houses
standing
singly
or
in
groupes
a
lake
about
a
mile
across
received
several
small
streams
and
on
its
edge
was
a
town
containing
about
a
thousand
houses
after
enjoying
the
beauties
of
the
scene
for
some
minutes
we
descended
by
a
rough
winding
road
and
entered
this
lunar
paradise
in
about
four
hours
along
the
sides
of
the
highway
we
travelled
were
planted
rows
of
trees
not
unlike
our
sycamores
which
afforded
a
refreshing
shade
to
the
traveller
and
commonly
a
rivulet
ran
bubbling
along
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
road
after
journeying
about
eight
miles
we
entered
a
neat
well
built
town
which
contained
as
we
were
informed
about
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
the
brahmin
informed
me
that
in
a
time
of
religious
fervour
about
two
centuries
ago
a
charter
was
granted
to
the
founder
of
a
new
sect
the
volbins
who
had
chanced
to
make
converts
of
some
of
the
leading
men
in
morosofia
authorising
him
and
his
followers
to
purchase
this
valley
of
the
hunting
tribe
to
whom
it
belonged
and
to
govern
themselves
by
their
own
laws
they
found
no
difficulty
in
making
the
purchase
it
was
then
used
as
a
mere
hunting
ground
no
one
liking
to
settle
in
a
place
that
seemed
shut
out
from
the
rest
of
the
world
at
first
the
new
settlers
divided
the
land
equally
among
all
the
inhabitants
one
of
their
tenets
being
that
as
there
was
no
difference
of
persons
in
the
next
world
there
should
be
no
difference
in
sharing
the
good
things
of
this
they
tried
at
first
to
preserve
this
equality
but
finding
it
impracticable
they
abandoned
it
it
is
said
that
after
about
thirty
years
by
reason
of
a
difference
in
their
industry
and
frugality
and
of
some
families
spending
less
than
they
made
and
some
more
the
number
of
land
owners
was
reduced
to
four
hundred
and
that
fifty
of
these
held
one
half
of
the
whole
since
which
time
the
number
of
landed
proprietors
has
declined
with
the
population
though
not
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
soil
is
remarkably
fertile
the
climate
healthy
and
the
people
temperate
and
industrious
they
multiplied
very
rapidly
until
they
reached
their
present
numbers
which
have
been
long
stationary
and
amount
to
that
is
about
four
hundred
to
a
square
mile
of
these
more
than
one
half
live
in
towns
and
villages
containing
from
one
hundred
to
a
thousand
houses
they
have
little
or
no
commerce
with
any
other
people
the
valley
producing
every
vegetable
production
and
the
mountains
every
mineral
which
they
require
and
in
fact
they
have
no
foreign
intercourse
whatever
except
when
they
visit
or
are
visited
from
curiosity
though
they
have
been
occasionally
bullied
and
threatened
by
lawless
and
overbearing
neighbours
yet
as
they
can
be
approached
by
only
a
single
gorge
in
the
mountain
which
is
always
well
garrisoned
and
they
present
no
sufficient
object
to
ambition
to
compensate
for
the
scandal
of
invading
so
inoffensive
and
virtuous
a
people
they
have
never
yet
been
engaged
in
war
i
felt
very
anxious
to
know
how
it
was
that
their
numbers
did
not
increase
as
they
were
exempt
from
all
pestilential
diseases
and
live
in
such
abundance
that
a
beggar
by
trade
has
never
been
known
among
them
and
are
remarkable
for
their
moral
habits
let
us
inquire
at
the
said
the
brahmin
and
we
went
to
see
the
chief
magistrate
who
received
us
in
a
style
of
unaffected
frankness
which
in
a
moment
put
us
at
our
ease
after
we
had
explained
to
him
who
we
were
and
answered
such
inquiries
as
he
chose
to
make
sir
said
i
through
the
brahmin
who
acted
as
interpreter
i
have
heard
much
of
your
country
and
i
find
on
seeing
it
that
it
exceeds
report
in
the
order
comfort
contentment
and
abundance
of
the
people
but
i
am
puzzled
to
find
out
how
it
is
that
your
numbers
do
not
increase
i
presume
you
marry
late
in
life
on
the
contrary
said
he
every
young
man
marries
as
soon
as
he
receives
his
education
and
is
capable
of
managing
the
concerns
of
a
family
some
are
thus
qualified
sooner
and
some
later
some
occasionally
migrate
then
never
a
number
of
our
young
men
indeed
visit
foreign
countries
but
not
one
in
a
hundred
settles
abroad
how
then
do
your
associates
continue
stationary
nothing
is
more
easy
no
man
has
a
larger
family
than
his
land
or
labour
can
support
in
comfort
and
as
long
as
that
is
the
case
with
every
individual
it
must
continue
to
be
the
case
with
the
whole
community
we
leave
the
matter
to
individual
discretion
the
prudential
caution
which
is
thus
indicated
has
been
taught
us
by
our
own
experience
we
had
gone
on
increasing
under
the
encouraging
influence
of
a
mild
system
of
laws
genial
climate
and
fruitful
soil
until
about
a
century
ago
we
found
that
our
numbers
were
greater
than
our
country
abundant
as
it
is
could
comfortably
support
and
our
seasons
being
unfavourable
for
two
successive
years
many
of
our
citizens
were
obliged
to
banish
themselves
from
okalbia
and
their
education
not
fitting
them
for
a
different
state
of
society
they
suffered
severely
both
in
their
comforts
and
morals
it
is
now
a
primary
moral
duty
enforced
by
all
our
juvenile
instructors
with
every
citizen
to
adapt
his
family
to
his
means
and
thus
a
regard
which
each
individual
has
for
his
offspring
is
the
salvation
of
the
state
and
can
these
prudential
restraints
be
generally
practised
what
a
virtuous
people
love
for
one
another
brings
the
two
sexes
together
love
for
their
offspring
makes
them
separate
i
see
said
the
magistrate
smiling
you
are
under
an
error
no
separation
takes
place
and
none
is
necessary
how
then
am
i
to
believe
you
are
to
believe
nothing
said
he
with
calm
dignity
which
is
incompatible
with
virtue
and
propriety
i
see
that
the
most
important
of
all
sciences
that
one
on
which
the
and
improvement
of
society
mainly
depends
is
in
its
infancy
with
you
but
whenever
you
become
as
populous
as
we
are
and
unite
the
knowledge
of
real
happiness
with
the
practice
of
virtue
you
will
understand
it
it
is
one
of
our
maxims
that
heaven
gives
wisdom
to
man
in
such
portions
as
his
situation
requires
it
and
no
doubt
it
is
the
same
with
the
people
of
your
earth
i
did
not
after
this
push
my
inquiries
farther
but
remarked
aside
to
the
brahmin
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
this
secret
provided
it
would
suit
our
planet
it
is
already
known
there
replied
he
and
has
been
long
practised
by
many
in
the
east
but
in
the
present
state
of
society
with
you
it
might
do
more
harm
than
good
to
be
made
public
by
removing
one
of
the
checks
of
licentiousness
where
women
are
so
unrestrained
as
they
are
with
you
changing
now
the
subject
i
ventured
to
inquire
how
they
employed
their
leisure
hours
and
whether
many
did
not
experience
here
a
wearisome
sameness
and
a
feeling
of
confinement
and
restraint
it
is
true
said
the
magistrate
men
require
variety
but
i
would
not
have
you
suppose
he
can
not
find
it
here
he
may
cultivate
his
lands
improve
his
mind
educate
his
children
these
are
his
serious
occupations
affording
every
day
some
employment
that
is
at
once
new
and
interesting
and
by
way
of
relaxation
he
has
music
painting
and
sculpture
sailing
riding
conversation
storytelling
and
reading
the
news
of
what
is
passing
both
in
the
valley
and
out
of
it
i
asked
if
they
had
newspapers
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
added
that
they
contained
minute
details
of
the
births
deaths
marriages
accidents
state
of
the
weather
and
crops
arbitrations
public
festivals
inventions
original
poetry
and
prose
compositions
in
addition
to
which
they
had
about
fifty
of
their
most
promising
young
men
travelling
abroad
who
made
observations
on
all
that
was
remarkable
in
the
countries
they
passed
through
which
they
regularly
transmitted
once
a
month
to
okalbia
i
inquired
if
they
travelled
at
the
public
expense
or
their
own
they
always
pursue
some
profession
or
trade
by
the
profits
of
which
they
support
themselves
we
have
nothing
but
intellect
and
ingenuity
to
export
for
though
our
country
produces
every
thing
there
is
no
commodity
that
we
can
so
well
spare
their
talents
find
them
employment
every
where
and
the
necessity
they
are
under
of
a
laborious
exertion
of
these
talents
and
of
submitting
to
a
great
deal
from
those
whose
customs
and
manners
are
not
to
their
taste
and
whom
they
feel
inferior
to
themselves
is
a
considerable
check
to
the
desire
to
go
abroad
so
much
so
that
we
hold
out
the
farther
inducement
of
political
distinction
when
they
return
what
then
you
have
ambition
among
you
certainly
our
institutions
have
only
tempered
it
and
not
vainly
endeavoured
to
extinguish
it
and
we
find
it
employment
in
this
way
of
our
youthful
travellers
those
who
are
most
diligent
in
their
vocation
who
give
the
most
useful
information
and
communicate
it
in
the
happiest
manner
are
made
magistrates
on
their
return
and
sometimes
have
statues
decreed
to
them
besides
the
name
which
their
conduct
or
talents
procure
them
abroad
is
echoed
back
to
the
valley
long
before
their
return
and
has
much
influence
in
the
general
estimate
of
their
character
but
have
you
not
many
more
competitors
than
you
have
public
offices
there
are
without
doubt
many
who
desire
office
but
to
manifest
their
wish
would
be
one
of
the
surest
means
of
defeating
it
we
require
modesty
at
least
in
appearance
moderation
and
disinterestedness
and
of
course
the
less
pains
a
candidate
takes
to
show
himself
off
the
better
but
have
they
no
friends
who
can
at
once
render
them
this
service
and
relieve
them
from
the
odium
of
it
there
is
indeed
somewhat
of
this
but
you
must
remember
that
the
highest
of
our
magistrates
has
comparatively
little
power
he
has
no
army
no
treasury
no
patronage
he
merely
executes
the
laws
but
as
a
farther
check
on
the
immoderate
zeal
of
friends
the
expense
of
doing
this
as
well
as
of
maintaining
him
in
office
is
defrayed
by
those
who
vote
for
him
there
seems
at
first
view
but
little
justice
in
this
regulation
but
we
think
that
as
every
one
can
not
have
his
way
those
who
carry
their
point
and
have
the
power
should
also
bear
the
burden
besides
in
this
way
the
voices
of
the
most
generous
and
disinterested
prevail
we
have
he
added
found
this
the
most
difficult
part
of
our
government
we
once
thought
that
the
very
lively
interest
excited
in
the
electioneering
contests
particularly
for
that
of
gompoo
or
chief
magistrate
was
to
be
ascribed
to
the
power
he
possessed
and
we
resorted
to
various
expedients
to
lessen
it
such
as
dividing
it
among
a
greater
number
requiring
a
quick
rotation
of
office
abridging
the
powers
themselves
but
we
discovered
that
however
small
the
power
the
distinction
it
gave
to
those
who
possessed
it
was
always
an
object
of
lively
interest
with
the
ambitious
and
indeed
with
the
public
in
general
we
have
therefore
enlarged
the
power
and
the
term
of
holding
it
and
make
him
who
would
attain
it
purchase
it
by
previous
exertion
and
and
we
farther
compel
those
who
favour
him
to
lose
as
well
as
gain
we
array
the
love
of
money
against
the
love
of
power
or
rather
one
love
of
power
to
another
moreover
as
it
is
only
by
the
civic
virtues
that
our
citizens
recommend
themselves
to
popular
favour
there
is
nothing
of
that
enthusiasm
which
military
success
excites
among
the
natives
our
washington
then
presented
himself
to
my
mind
and
for
a
moment
i
began
to
question
his
claim
to
the
unexampled
honours
bestowed
on
him
by
his
countrymen
until
i
recollected
that
he
was
as
distinguished
by
his
respect
for
the
laws
and
his
sound
views
of
national
policy
as
for
his
military
services
i
then
inquired
into
the
occupations
and
condition
of
those
who
were
without
land
and
was
told
that
they
were
either
cultivators
of
the
soil
or
practised
some
liberal
or
mechanical
art
and
partly
owing
to
the
education
they
receive
and
partly
from
the
active
competition
that
exists
among
them
they
are
skilful
diligent
and
honest
now
and
then
there
are
some
exceptions
according
to
the
proverb
that
the
best
field
of
grain
there
will
be
some
bad
the
sometimes
cultivate
the
soil
with
their
own
hands
sometimes
with
hired
labourers
and
sometimes
they
rent
them
for
about
a
third
of
their
produce
the
smallest
proprietors
commonly
adopt
the
first
course
the
middling
the
second
and
the
great
landholders
the
third
but
i
thought
said
i
that
all
the
land
in
the
valley
was
of
equal
fertility
so
it
is
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
rent
sir
said
i
our
ablest
writers
on
this
subject
have
lately
discovered
that
there
can
be
no
rent
where
there
is
not
a
gradation
of
soils
such
as
exists
in
every
country
of
the
earth
i
see
not
said
he
what
could
have
led
them
into
that
error
it
is
true
if
there
was
inferior
land
there
would
be
a
difference
of
rent
in
proportion
to
the
difference
of
fertility
and
if
it
was
so
poor
as
merely
to
repay
the
expense
of
cultivation
it
would
yield
no
rent
at
all
but
surely
if
one
man
makes
as
much
as
several
consume
and
this
he
can
easily
do
with
us
he
will
be
able
to
get
much
of
their
labour
in
exchange
for
this
surplus
which
is
so
indispensable
to
them
and
to
get
more
and
more
until
the
greatest
number
has
come
into
existence
which
such
surplus
can
support
what
they
thus
give

this
is

was
no

i
could
not

exclaiming
surely
there
is
nothing

rather
truth
is

another
thing
on

concerning

the
pleasures
of

traced
to
association
by
a
glonglim
though
i
felt
some
reluctance
to
abuse
the
patience
of
this
polite
and
intelligent
magistrate
i
could
not
help
making
some
inquiry
about
the
jurisprudence
of
his
country
and
first
what
was
their
system
of
punishment
we
have
no
capital
punishment
says
he
for
from
all
we
learn
it
is
not
more
efficacious
in
preventing
crime
than
other
punishments
which
are
milder
and
we
prefer
making
the
example
to
offenders
a
lasting
one
but
we
endeavour
to
prevent
offences
not
so
much
by
punishment
as
by
education
and
the
few
crimes
committed
among
us
bring
certain
censure
on
those
who
have
the
early
instruction
of
the
criminal
murders
are
very
rare
with
us
thefts
and
robbery
perhaps
still
more
so
our
ordinary
disputes
about
property
are
commonly
settled
by
arbitration
where
as
well
as
in
court
each
party
is
permitted
to
state
his
case
to
examine
what
witnesses
and
to
ask
what
questions
he
pleases
you
do
not
said
i
examine
witnesses
who
are
interested
why
not
the
judges
even
examine
the
parties
themselves
i
then
told
him
that
the
smallest
direct
interest
in
the
issue
of
the
controversy
disqualified
a
witness
with
us
from
the
strong
bias
it
created
to
misrepresent
facts
and
even
to
misconceive
them
he
replied
with
a
smile
it
seems
to
me
that
your
extreme
fear
of
hearing
falsehood
must
often
prevent
you
from
ascertaining
the
truth
it
is
true
that
wherever
the
interest
of
a
witness
is
involved
it
has
an
immediate
tendency
to
make
him
misstate
facts
but
so
would
personal
so
would
his
sympathies
so
would
any
strong
feeling
what
then
is
your
course
in
these
cases
i
told
him
that
these
objections
applied
to
the
credibility
and
not
to
the
competency
of
witnesses
which
distinctions
of
the
lawyers
i
endeavoured
to
explain
to
him
then
i
think
you
often
exclude
a
witness
who
is
under
a
small
bias
and
admit
another
who
is
under
a
great
one
you
allow
a
man
to
give
testimony
in
a
case
in
which
the
fortune
or
character
of
his
father
brother
or
child
is
involved
but
reject
him
in
a
case
in
which
he
is
not
interested
to
the
amount
of
a
greater
sum
than
he
would
give
to
the
first
beggar
he
met
is
it
not
so
that
indeed
may
be
the
operation
of
the
rule
but
cases
of
such
flagrant
inconsistency
are
very
rare
and
this
rule
like
every
other
must
be
tried
by
its
general
and
not
its
partial
effects
true
but
your
rule
must
at
least
be
a
troublesome
one
and
give
rise
to
a
great
many
nice
distinctions
that
make
it
difficult
in
the
application
all
laws
are
sufficiently
exposed
to
this
evil
and
we
do
not
wish
unnecessarily
to
increase
it
we
have
therefore
adopted
the
plan
of
allowing
either
party
to
ask
any
question
of
any
witness
he
pleases
and
leave
it
to
the
judges
to
estimate
the
circumstances
which
may
bias
the
witness
we
in
short
pursue
the
same
course
in
investigating
facts
in
court
that
we
pursue
out
of
it
when
no
one
forms
a
judgment
until
he
has
first
heard
what
the
parties
and
their
friends
say
on
the
subject
on
my
return
home
i
repeated
this
conversation
to
a
lawyer
of
my
acquaintance
who
told
me
that
such
a
rule
of
evidence
might
do
for
the
people
in
the
moon
but
it
certainly
would
not
suit
us
i
leave
the
matter
to
be
settled
by
more
competent
heads
than
mine
and
return
to
my
narrative
i
farther
learnt
from
this
intelligent
magistrate
that
the
territory
of
the
happy
valley
or
okalbia
is
divided
into
counties
and
each
county
into
ten
districts
in
each
district
are
three
magistrates
who
are
appointed
by
the
legislature
causes
of
small
value
are
decided
by
the
magistrates
of
the
district
those
of
greater
importance
by
the
county
courts
composed
of
all
the
magistrates
of
the
ten
districts
a
few
by
the
court
of
last
court
consisting
of
seven
judges
the
legislature
consists
of
two
houses
of
which
the
members
are
elected
annually
three
from
each
county
for
one
branch
and
one
member
for
the
other
no
qualification
of
property
is
required
either
to
vote
or
to
be
eligible
to
either
house
of
the
legislature
as
they
believe
that
the
natural
influence
of
property
is
sufficient
without
adding
to
that
influence
by
law
and
that
the
moral
effects
of
education
among
them
together
with
a
few
provisions
in
their
constitution
are
quite
sufficient
to
guard
against
any
improper
combination
of
those
who
have
small
property
besides
there
are
no
odious
privileges
exclusively
possessed
by
particular
classes
of
men
to
excite
the
envy
or
resentment
of
the
other
classes
and
induce
them
to
act
in
concert
have
you
then
no
parties
said
i
oh
yes
we
are
not
without
our
political
parties
and
disputes
and
we
sometimes
wrangle
about
very
small
matters
such
as
what
amount
of
labour
shall
be
bestowed
on
the
public
roads
the
best
modes
of
conducting
our
schools
and
colleges
the
comparative
merits
of
the
candidates
for
office
or
the
policy
of
some
proposed
change
in
the
laws
man
is
made
you
know
of
very
combustible
materials
and
may
be
kindled
as
effectually
by
a
spark
falling
at
the
right
time
in
the
right
place
as
when
within
reach
of
a
great
conflagration
the
women
appeared
here
to
be
under
few
restraints
i
understood
that
they
were
taught
like
our
sex
all
the
speculative
branches
of
knowledge
but
that
they
were
more
especially
instructed
by
professed
teachers
in
cookery
needlework
and
every
sort
of
domestic
economy
as
were
the
young
men
in
the
occupations
which
require
strength
and
exposure
they
have
a
variety
of
public
schools
and
some
houses
for
public
festivals
but
no
public
hospitals
or
almshouses
whatever
the
few
cases
of
private
distress
or
misfortune
being
left
for
relief
to
the
merits
of
the
sufferer
and
the
compassion
of
individuals
after
passing
a
week
among
this
singular
and
fortunate
people
whom
we
every
where
found
equally
amiable
intelligent
and
hospitable
we
returned
to
alamatua
in
the
same
way
that
we
had
come
that
is
in
a
light
car
drawn
by
four
large
mastiffs
when
we
had
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
and
i
had
carefully
committed
to
paper
all
that
i
had
learnt
of
the
okalbians
the
brahmin
and
i
took
a
walk
towards
a
part
of
the
suburbs
which
i
had
not
yet
seen
and
where
some
of
the
literati
of
his
acquaintance
resided
the
sun
appeared
to
be
not
more
than
two
hours
high
though
in
fact
it
was
more
than
fifty
the
sky
was
without
a
cloud
and
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
mountains
contributed
to
make
it
like
one
of
the
most
delightful
summer
evenings
of
a
temperate
climate
we
carelessly
rambled
along
enjoying
the
balmy
freshness
of
the
air
the
picturesque
scenery
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
the
beauty
or
fragrance
of
some
vegetable
productions
and
the
oddity
of
others
until
having
passed
through
a
thick
wood
we
came
to
an
extensive
plain
which
was
covered
with
the
queen
of
flowers
here
appeared
under
every
variety
of
colour
size
and
species
red
white
black
and
yellow
budding
and
some
with
thorns
and
some
without
some
odourless
and
others
exhaling
their
unrivalled
perfume
with
an
overpowering
sweetness
i
was
about
to
pluck
one
of
these
flowers
of
which
i
have
always
been
particularly
fond
when
a
man
whom
i
had
not
previously
observed
stepping
up
behind
me
seized
my
arm
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
he
told
us
that
the
roses
of
this
field
which
is
called
gulgal
were
deemed
sacred
and
were
not
allowed
to
be
gathered
without
the
special
permission
of
the
priests
under
a
heavy
penalty
and
that
he
was
one
of
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
prevent
the
violation
of
the
law
and
to
bring
the
offenders
to
punishment
the
brahmin
having
diverted
himself
a
while
with
my
surprise
and
disappointment
then
informed
me
that
the
rose
had
ever
been
regarded
in
morosofia
as
the
symbol
of
female
purity
delicacy
and
sweetness
which
notion
had
grown
into
a
popular
superstition
that
whenever
a
marriage
is
consummated
on
the
earth
one
of
these
flowers
springs
up
in
the
moon
and
that
in
colour
shape
size
or
other
property
it
is
a
fit
type
of
the
individual
whose
change
of
state
is
thus
commemorated
what
father
said
i
could
have
given
rise
to
so
strange
an
opinion
i
know
not
said
he
but
i
have
heard
it
thus
explained
that
the
roses
generally
spring
up
as
well
as
blow
in
the
course
of
their
long
nights
during
which
the
earth
resplendent
disc
is
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
the
heavens
which
two
facts
stand
in
the
opinion
of
the
multitude
in
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
attributing
then
the
symbolical
character
of
the
rose
to
its
tutelary
planet
they
regard
the
earth
in
the
same
light
as
the
ancients
did
the
chaste
diana
and
believe
that
she
plants
this
her
favourite
flower
in
the
moon
whenever
she
loses
a
votary
the
priesthood
encourage
this
superstition
as
they
have
grafted
on
it
some
mystical
rites
which
add
to
their
power
and
profit
and
which
one
of
our
pundits
thinks
has
a
great
resemblance
to
the
eleusinian
mysteries
there
is
however
my
dear
atterley
little
satisfaction
in
tracing
the
origin
of
vulgar
superstitions
they
grow
up
like
a
strange
plant
in
a
forest
without
our
being
able
to
tell
how
the
seed
found
its
way
there
it
is
generally
believed
in
the
east
that
the
moon
at
particular
periods
of
her
revolution
round
the
earth
has
a
great
influence
in
causing
rain
though
every
one
must
see
that
notwithstanding
such
influence
must
be
the
same
in
every
part
of
the
earth
it
is
invariably
fair
in
one
place
at
the
very
time
that
it
is
rainy
in
another
nay
we
may
safely
aver
that
there
is
not
a
day
nor
an
hour
in
the
year
in
which
it
is
not
dry
and
rainy
cloudy
and
clear
windy
and
calm
in
hundreds
of
places
at
once
i
told
the
brahmin
that
the
same
opinion
prevailed
in
my
country
that
the
vulgar
also
believe
the
moon
according
to
its
age
to
have
particular
effects
on
the
flesh
of
slaughtered
animals
and
that
all
sailors
distinguish
between
a
wet
and
a
dry
day
according
to
the
position
of
the
crescent
we
then
inquired
of
the
warden
of
this
flowery
plain
if
he
had
ever
remarked
any
difference
in
the
number
of
roses
which
sprung
up
in
a
given
period
of
time
he
said
he
thought
they
were
more
numerous
about
five
and
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
or
since
with
that
exception
he
said
the
number
appeared
to
be
nearly
the
same
every
year
the
brahmin
happening
to
be
in
one
of
those
pleasant
moods
which
are
occasionally
experienced
by
amiable
tempers
even
when
under
the
pressure
of
sorrow
and
age
now
amused
himself
in
pointing
out
the
flowers
which
probably
represented
the
different
nations
of
the
earth
and
when
he
saw
any
one
remarkably
small
pale
and
delicate
he
insisted
that
it
belonged
to
his
own
country
which
point
however
i
not
yielding
to
him
in
nationality
warmly
contested
i
would
here
remark
that
as
the
rose
is
called
in
the
persian
language
and
the
ancient
sanscrit
the
name
of
this
field
furnished
another
argument
in
support
of
the
brahmin
hypothesis
of
the
origin
of
the
moon
while
thus
oblivious
of
the
past
and
reckless
of
the
future
we
were
enjoying
the
present
moment
in
this
and
i
was
extolling
the
odour
of
the
rose
as
beyond
every
other
grateful
to
the
olfactory
nerves
of
man
a
lively
flippant
little
personage
came
up
and
accosted
the
brahmin
with
the
familiarity
of
an
acquaintance
my
companion
immediately
introduced
me
to
him
and
at
the
same
time
gave
me
to
understand
that
this
was
the
great
reffei
one
of
the
most
distinguished
literati
of
the
country
although
his
eye
was
remarkably
piercing
i
perceived
in
it
somewhat
of
the
wildness
which
always
characterizes
a
glonglim
he
was
evidently
impatient
for
discussion
and
having
informed
himself
of
the
subject
of
my
rhapsody
when
he
joined
our
party
he
vehemently
exclaimed
i
am
surprised
at
your
falling
in
with
that
popular
prejudice
while
it
is
easy
to
show
that
but
for
some
feeling
of
love
or
pity
or
admiration
with
which
the
rose
happens
to
be
associated
some
past
pleasure
which
it
brings
to
your
recollection
or
some
future
pleasure
which
it
suggests
any
other
flower
would
be
equally
sweet
you
see
the
rose
a
very
beautiful
flower
and
you
have
been
accustomed
whenever
you
saw
and
felt
its
beauty
to
perceive
at
the
same
time
a
certain
odour
the
beauty
and
the
odour
thus
become
associated
in
your
mind
and
the
smell
brings
along
with
it
the
pleasure
you
feel
in
looking
at
it
but
the
chief
part
of
the
gratification
you
receive
from
smelling
a
rose
arises
from
some
past
scene
of
delight
of
which
it
reminds
you
as
of
the
days
of
your
innocence
and
childhood
when
you
ran
about
the
garden
or
when
you
were
decorated
with
nosegays
or
danced
round
a
this
is
rather
a
free
translation
or
presented
a
bunch
of
flowers
to
some
little
favourite
he
said
a
great
deal
more
on
the
subject
and
spoke
so
prettily
and
ingeniously
as
almost
to
make
a
convert
of
me
when
on
bringing
my
nose
once
more
to
the
flower
i
found
in
it
the
same
exquisite
fragrance
as
ever
why
do
we
like
he
continued
the
smell
of
a
or
of
a
cup
of
tea
except
for
the
pleasure
we
receive
from
their
taste
i
mentioned
as
an
exception
to
his
theory
the
codfish
which
is
esteemed
a
very
savoury
dish
by
my
countrymen
but
which
no
one
ever
regarded
as
very
fragrant
but
he
repelled
my
objection
by
an
ingenious
hypothesis
grounded
on
certain
physiological
facts
to
show
that
this
supposed
disagreeable
smell
was
also
the
effect
of
some
early
associations
i
then
mentioned
to
him
assafoetida
the
odour
of
which
i
believed
was
universally
odious
he
immediately
replied
that
we
are
always
accustomed
to
associate
with
this
drug
the
disagreeable
ideas
of
sickness
female
weakness
hysterics
affectation
unable
to
continue
the
argument
i
felt
myself
vanquished
i
again
stooped
to
the
flower
and
as
i
inhaled
its
perfume
surely
said
i
to
myself
this
rose
would
be
sweet
if
i
were
to
lose
my
memory
altogether
but
recollecting
the
great
reffei
argument
i
mentally
added
thanks
to
divine
philosophy
which
always
corrects
our
natural
prejudices

sun
sinks
below
the
horizon
having
taken
a
short
repast
while
the
brahmin
called
on
one
of
his
acquaintance
i
sallied
forth
into
the
street
and
soon
found
myself
in
the
bustling
throng
who
were
hastening
to
this
great
resort
of
the
busy
the
idle
the
knavish
and
the
gay
some
in
pursuit
of
gain
and
some
of
pleasure
whilst
others
again
without
any
settled
purpose
were
carried
along
by
the
vague
desire
of
meeting
with
somewhat
to
relieve
them
from
the
pain
of
idleness
the
fair
was
held
in
a
large
square
piece
of
ground
in
one
of
the
suburbs
set
apart
for
that
purpose
and
on
each
of
its
four
sides
a
long
low
building
or
rather
roof
supported
on
massy
white
columns
extended
about
six
hundred
yards
in
length
and
was
thirty
yards
wide
immediately
within
this
arcade
were
arranged
the
finer
kinds
of
merchandise
fabrics
of
cotton
or
silk
and
articles
of
jewelry
cutlery
porcelain
and
glass
on
the
outside
were
provisions
of
every
kind
vegetable
and
animal
flesh
fish
and
fowl
as
well
as
the
coarser
manufactures
at
no
great
distance
from
this
hollow
square
which
was
used
exclusively
for
buying
and
selling
might
be
seen
an
infinite
variety
of
persons
collected
in
groupes
all
engaged
in
some
occupation
or
amusement
according
to
their
several
tastes
and
humours
here
a
party
of
young
men
were
jumping
or
wrestling
or
shooting
at
a
mark
with
there
girls
and
boys
were
dancing
to
the
sound
of
a
pipe
or
still
smaller
children
were
playing
at
marbles
or
amusing
themselves
with
the
toys
they
had
just
purchased
not
far
from
these
a
quack
from
one
scaffold
was
descanting
on
the
virtues
of
his
medicines
whilst
a
preacher
from
another
was
holding
forth
to
the
graver
part
of
the
crowd
the
joys
and
terrors
of
another
life
and
yet
farther
on
a
motley
groupe
were
listening
to
a
blind
beggar
who
was
singing
to
the
music
of
a
sort
of
rude
guitar
here
and
there
curtains
hanging
from
a
slight
frame
of
veiled
a
small
square
from
the
eyes
of
all
except
those
who
paid
a
nail
for
admittance
some
of
these
curtained
boxes
contained
jugglers
some
tumblers
some
libidinous
pictures
and
others
again
strange
birds
beasts
and
other
animals
i
observed
that
none
of
the
exhibitions
were
as
much
frequented
as
these
booths
and
i
was
told
that
the
corporation
of
the
city
derived
from
them
a
considerable
revenue
amidst
such
an
infinite
variety
of
objects
my
attention
was
so
distracted
that
it
could
not
settle
down
upon
any
one
and
i
strolled
about
without
object
or
design
when
i
had
become
more
familiar
with
this
mixed
multitude
of
sights
and
sounds
i
endeavoured
to
take
a
closer
survey
of
some
of
the
objects
composing
the
medley
the
first
thing
which
attracted
my
particular
notice
was
a
profusion
of
oaths
and
imprecations
which
proceeded
from
one
of
the
curtained
booths
i
paid
the
admittance
money
to
a
man
of
smooth
easy
manners
and
entered
i
found
there
several
parties
paired
off
and
engaged
at
different
games
but
like
the
rest
of
the
bystanders
i
felt
myself
most
strongly
attracted
towards
the
two
who
were
betting
highest
one
of
these
was
an
elderly
man
of
a
tall
stature
in
a
plain
dress
the
other
was
a
short
man
in
very
costly
apparel
and
some
years
younger
for
a
long
time
the
scales
of
victory
seemed
balanced
between
them
but
at
length
the
tall
man
who
had
great
and
who
played
with
consummate
skill
won
the
game
soon
after
which
he
rose
up
and
making
a
graceful
respectful
bow
to
the
rest
of
the
company
he
retired
not
being
able
to
catch
his
eye
so
intent
was
he
on
his
game
i
felt
some
curiosity
to
know
whether
he
was
a
glonglim
but
could
not
ascertain
the
fact
as
some
of
whom
the
brahmin
inquired
said
that
he
was
while
others
maintained
that
he
was
not
his
adversary
however
evidently
belonged
to
that
class
and
when
flushed
with
hope
reminded
me
of
the
at
first
he
endeavoured
by
forced
smiles
to
conceal
his
rage
and
disappointment
he
then
bit
his
lips
with
vexation
and
challenged
one
of
the
bystanders
to
play
for
a
smaller
stake
fortune
seemed
about
to
smile
on
him
on
this
occasion
but
one
of
the
company
who
appeared
to
be
very
much
respected
by
the
rest
detected
the
little
man
in
some
false
play
and
publicly
exposing
him
broke
up
the
game
i
understood
afterwards
that
before
the
fair
was
over
the
gamester
avenged
himself
for
this
injury
in
the
other
blood
that
he
then
returned
to
the
fair
secretly
entered
another
gambling
booth
where
he
betted
so
rashly
that
he
soon
lost
not
only
his
patrimonial
estate
which
was
large
but
his
acquired
wealth
which
was
much
larger
having
lost
all
his
property
and
even
his
clothes
he
then
staked
and
lost
his
liberty
and
even
his
teeth
which
were
very
good
and
he
will
thus
be
compelled
to
live
on
soups
for
the
rest
of
his
life
i
saw
several
other
matches
played
in
which
great
sums
were
betted
great
skill
was
exhibited
and
occasionally
much
unfairness
practised
there
was
one
man
in
the
crowd
whose
extraordinary
good
fortune
i
could
not
but
admire
he
went
about
from
table
to
table
sometimes
betting
high
and
sometimes
low
but
was
generally
successful
until
he
had
won
as
much
as
he
could
fairly
carry
after
which
he
went
out
and
amused
himself
at
a
and
the
stall
of
a
with
whom
he
had
formerly
quarrelled
but
who
now
when
she
learnt
his
success
was
obsequiously
civil
to
him
i
did
not
see
that
he
manifested
superior
skill
but
still
he
was
successful
and
in
his
last
great
stake
with
a
young
but
not
inexpert
player
he
won
the
game
though
the
chances
were
three
to
two
against
him
surely
thought
i
fortune
rules
the
destinies
of
man
in
the
moon
as
well
as
on
the
earth
on
looking
now
at
my
watch
i
found
that
i
had
been
longer
a
witness
of
these
trials
of
skill
and
fortune
than
i
had
been
aware
and
on
leaving
the
booth
perceived
that
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
western
mountains
and
that
the
earth
began
to
beam
with
her
nocturnal
splendour
those
who
had
come
from
a
distance
were
already
hurrying
back
with
their
carts
and
here
and
there
light
cars
of
various
forms
and
colours
and
drawn
by
dogs
were
conveying
those
away
whose
object
had
been
amusement
some
were
snatching
a
hasty
meal
and
a
few
by
their
quiet
air
seemed
as
if
they
meant
to
continue
on
the
spot
as
long
as
the
regulations
permit
after
sunset
which
is
about
twenty
of
our
hours
i
found
the
brahmin
at
home
when
i
returned
and
i
felt
as
much
pleased
to
see
him
as
if
we
had
not
seen
each
other
for
many
months
as
the
shades
of
night
approached
my
anxiety
to
return
to
my
native
planet
increased
and
i
urged
my
friend
to
lose
no
time
in
preparing
for
our
departure
we
were
soon
afterwards
informed
that
a
man
high
in
office
and
renowned
for
his
political
sagacity
proposed
to
detain
us
on
the
ground
that
when
such
voyages
as
ours
were
shown
to
be
practicable
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
who
were
so
much
more
numerous
than
those
of
the
moon
might
invade
the
latter
with
a
large
army
for
the
purposes
of
rapine
and
conquest
we
farther
learnt
that
this
opinion
which
was
at
first
cautiously
circulated
in
the
higher
circles
had
become
more
generally
known
and
was
producing
a
strong
sensation
among
the
people
the
brahmin
immediately
presented
himself
before
the
council
of
state
to
remove
the
impression
he
pointed
out
to
them
the
insurmountable
obstacles
to
such
an
invasion
physical
and
moral
he
urged
to
them
that
the
nations
of
the
earth
felt
so
much
jealousy
and
towards
one
another
that
they
never
cordially
in
any
enterprise
for
their
common
interest
or
glory
and
that
if
any
one
nation
were
to
send
an
army
into
the
moon
such
a
scheme
of
ambition
would
afford
at
once
a
temptation
and
pretext
for
its
neighbours
to
invade
it
that
his
country
had
not
the
ability
and
mine
had
not
the
inclination
to
attack
the
liberties
of
any
other
so
far
from
that
he
informed
them
on
my
authority
that
we
were
in
the
habit
of
sending
teachers
abroad
to
instruct
other
nations
in
the
duties
of
religion
morals
and
humanity
he
entered
into
some
calculations
to
show
that
the
project
was
also
impracticable
on
account
of
its
expense
and
lastly
insisted
that
if
all
other
difficulties
were
removed
we
should
find
it
impossible
to
convince
the
people
of
the
earth
that
we
had
really
been
to
the
moon
i
have
since
found
that
the
brahmin
was
more
right
in
his
last
argument
than
i
then
believed
possible
i
am
not
able
to
say
what
effect
these
representations
of
the
brahmin
would
have
produced
if
they
had
not
been
taken
up
and
enforced
by
the
political
rival
of
him
who
had
first
opposed
our
departure
but
by
his
powerful
aid
they
finally
triumphed
and
we
obtained
a
formal
permission
to
leave
the
moon
whenever
we
thought
proper
as
we
meant
to
return
in
the
same
machine
in
which
we
came
we
were
not
long
in
preparing
for
our
voyage
we
proposed
to
set
out
about
the
middle
of
the
night
and
we
passed
the
chief
part
of
the
interval
in
making
visits
of
ceremony
and
in
calling
on
those
who
had
shown
us
civility
i
endeavoured
also
to
collect
such
articles
as
i
thought
would
be
most
curious
and
rare
in
my
own
country
and
most
likely
to
produce
conviction
with
those
who
might
be
disposed
to
question
the
fact
of
my
voyage
i
was
obliged
however
to
limit
myself
to
such
things
as
were
neither
bulky
nor
weighty
the
brahmin
thinking
that
after
we
had
taken
in
our
instruments
and
the
necessary
provisions
we
could
not
safely
take
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
in
addition
some
of
my
lunar
curiosities
which
i
thought
would
be
most
new
and
interesting
to
my
countrymen
have
proved
to
be
very
familiar
to
our
men
of
science
this
has
been
most
remarkably
the
case
with
my
mineral
specimens
of
the
leaves
and
flowers
of
above
seventy
plants
which
i
brought
more
than
forty
are
found
on
the
earth
and
several
of
these
grow
in
my
native
state
with
the
insects
i
have
been
more
successful
but
some
of
these
as
well
as
of
the
plants
i
am
assured
are
found
on
the
coasts
of
the
pacific
or
in
the
islands
of
that
ocean
which
fact
by
the
way
gives
a
farther
support
to
the
brahmin
hypothesis
besides
the
productions
of
nature
that
i
have
mentioned
i
procured
some
specimens
of
their
cloth
a
few
light
toys
a
lady
turban
decorated
with
cantharides
a
pair
of
slippers
with
heavy
metallic
soles
which
are
used
there
for
walking
in
a
strong
wind
and
by
the
dancing
girls
to
prevent
their
jumping
too
high
as
this
metal
which
gravitates
to
the
moon
is
repelled
from
the
earth
these
slippers
assist
the
wearer
here
in
springing
from
the
ground
as
much
as
they
impeded
it
in
the
moon
and
therefore
i
have
lent
them
to
madame
of
the
theatre
who
is
thus
enabled
to
astonish
and
delight
the
spectators
with
her
wonderful
lightness
and
agility
but
there
is
nothing
that
i
have
brought
which
i
prize
so
highly
as
a
few
of
their
manuscripts
the
lunarians
write
as
we
do
from
left
to
right
but
when
their
words
consist
of
more
than
one
syllable
all
the
subsequent
syllables
are
put
over
the
first
so
that
what
we
call
they
call
ones
which
mode
of
writing
makes
them
more
striking
to
the
eye
this
peculiarity
has
perhaps
had
some
effect
in
giving
their
writers
a
magniloquence
of
style
something
like
that
which
so
laudably
characterises
our
fourth
of
july
orations
and
funeral
panegyrics
that
composition
being
thought
the
finest
in
which
the
words
stand
highest
another
advantage
of
this
mode
of
writing
is
that
they
can
crowd
more
in
a
small
page
so
that
a
long
discourse
if
it
is
also
very
eloquent
may
be
compressed
in
a
single
page
i
have
left
some
of
the
manuscripts
with
the
publisher
of
this
work
for
the
gratification
of
the
public
curiosity
having
taken
either
respectful
or
affectionate
leave
of
all
and
got
every
thing
in
readiness
on
the
day
of
august
about
midnight
we
again
entered
our
copper
balloon
if
i
may
so
speak
and
rose
from
the
moon
with
the
same
velocity
as
we
had
formerly
ascended
from
the
earth
though
i
experienced
somewhat
of
my
former
sensations
when
i
again
found
myself
off
the
solid
ground
yet
i
soon
regained
my
and
animated
with
the
hope
of
seeing
my
children
and
country
with
the
past
success
of
our
voyage
and
i
will
not
disguise
it
with
the
distinction
which
i
expected
it
would
procure
me
from
my
countrymen
i
was
in
excellent
spirits
the
brahmin
exhibited
the
same
mild
equanimity
as
ever
as
the
course
of
our
ascent
was
now
less
inclined
from
the
vertical
line
than
before
in
proportion
as
the
motion
of
the
moon
on
its
axis
is
slower
than
that
of
the
earth
we
for
some
hours
could
see
the
former
only
by
the
light
reflected
from
our
planet
and
although
the
objects
on
the
moon
surface
were
less
distinct
they
appeared
yet
more
beautiful
in
my
eyes
than
they
had
done
in
the
glare
of
day
the
difference
however
may
be
in
part
attributed
to
my
being
now
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
for
enjoying
the
scene
as
our
distance
increased
the
face
of
the
moon
became
of
a
lighter
and
more
uniform
tint
until
at
length
it
looked
like
one
vast
lake
of
melted
silver
with
here
and
there
small
pieces
of
greyish
dross
floating
on
it
after
contemplating
this
lovely
and
magnificent
spectacle
for
about
an
hour
i
turned
to
the
brahmin
and
reminded
him
of
his
former
promise
to
give
me
the
history
of
his
early
life
he
replied
as
you
have
seen
all
that
you
can
see
of
the
moon
and
the
objects
of
the
earth
are
yet
too
indistinct
to
excite
much
interest
i
am
not
likely
to
have
a
more
suitable
occasion
and
after
a
short
pause
he
began
in
the
way
that
the
reader
may
see
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
xvi
brahmin
gives
atterley
a
history
of
his
i
have
already
informed
you
that
i
was
born
at
benares
which
as
you
know
is
a
populous
city
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
and
the
most
celebrated
seat
of
hindoo
science
and
literature
my
father
was
a
priest
of
vishun
of
a
high
rank
and
as
his
functions
required
him
to
live
within
the
precincts
of
the
pagoda
he
was
liberally
maintained
out
of
its
ample
revenues
i
was
his
only
son
and
according
to
the
usage
of
our
country
was
destined
to
the
same
holy
calling
at
an
early
age
i
was
put
under
a
private
tutor
and
then
sent
to
one
of
the
schools
attached
to
the
pagoda
upon
what
little
matters
my
dear
atterley
do
our
fortunes
and
even
our
characters
depend
had
i
been
sent
to
another
school
the
whole
destiny
of
my
life
would
have
been
changed
i
was
in
my
twelfth
year
when
i
entered
this
school
which
contained
from
thirty
to
forty
boys
about
my
age
the
cleverest
of
these
was
balty
mahu
who
like
myself
belonged
to
the
higher
order
of
brahmins
he
took
the
lead
not
only
in
the
exercises
within
the
school
but
in
all
the
sports
and
pastimes
out
of
it
nature
however
had
not
been
equally
kind
to
him
in
temper
and
disposition
he
was
restless
ambitious
proud
vindictive
and
implacable
he
could
occasionally
too
practise
cunning
and
deception
although
anger
and
violence
were
more
congenial
to
his
nature
it
soon
appeared
that
i
was
to
be
his
rival
in
the
school
and
from
that
moment
he
cordially
hated
me
the
praises
that
had
previously
been
lavished
on
him
by
the
teacher
were
now
shared
by
me
and
most
of
the
boys
secretly
rejoiced
to
see
his
proud
spirit
humbled
in
our
sports
i
was
also
his
successful
competitor
nature
had
given
me
an
excellent
constitution
and
though
i
had
not
a
very
robust
frame
i
could
boast
of
great
agility
and
flexibility
of
limbs
when
the
sun
had
descended
behind
the
mountain
which
screened
our
from
his
evening
rays
we
commonly
amused
ourselves
in
and
other
pastimes
of
which
running
was
an
important
part
in
this
exercise
i
had
no
equal
i
could
also
jump
higher
and
farther
than
any
boy
in
school
except
one
and
that
one
was
not
balty
mahu
his
was
not
slow
in
manifesting
itself
he
took
every
occasion
of
contradicting
me
sometimes
indulged
in
sly
sneers
at
my
expense
and
now
and
then
even
attempted
to
turn
me
into
open
ridicule
i
always
replied
with
spirit
but
i
found
such
contests
as
disagreeable
to
me
as
they
were
new
one
evening
under
the
pretext
that
i
had
purposely
jostled
him
in
running
he
struck
me
and
we
fought
although
he
was
probably
stronger
than
i
as
he
was
heavier
and
older
my
suppleness
enabled
me
to
get
the
better
of
him
in
a
wrestle
and
i
got
him
under
me
when
the
master
attracted
by
the
shouts
of
the
boys
made
his
appearance
he
separated
and
reproved
us
and
sent
us
off
in
disgrace
to
our
respective
rooms
from
that
time
balty
mahu
treated
me
with
more
outward
respect
than
before
but
i
believe
he
hated
me
with
more
rancour
than
ever
i
had
now
become
the
general
favourite
of
the
boys
the
school
was
indeed
divided
into
parties
but
mine
was
much
the
strongest
and
of
those
who
adhered
to
my
rival
very
few
seemed
cordially
to
dislike
me
though
this
state
of
things
was
very
annoying
to
me
it
proved
advantageous
in
one
respect
as
it
made
me
more
diligent
in
my
studies
lest
i
should
furnish
my
rival
with
an
occasion
of
triumphing
ever
me
so
that
i
owe
a
part
of
what
i
gained
to
the
enmity
of
my
rival
when
i
had
reached
my
sixteenth
year
i
was
removed
to
the
college
in
benares
this
is
commonly
a
very
interesting
event
in
the
life
of
a
youth
as
it
reminds
him
that
he
is
drawing
near
the
period
of
manhood
and
leaves
him
more
a
master
of
his
actions
but
on
the
present
occasion
my
pleasure
had
two
drawbacks
i
could
not
but
feel
the
contrast
between
the
warm
and
confiding
attachment
of
my
late
and
the
coldness
and
reserve
of
my
new
companions
yet
the
most
disagreeable
circumstance
was
that
i
here
met
with
my
former
rival
balty
mahu
he
had
entered
the
college
about
a
month
before
me
and
aware
of
my
intention
had
spared
no
pains
as
i
afterwards
learnt
of
prejudicing
the
students
against
me
after
a
few
months
however
our
relative
standing
was
the
same
here
as
it
had
been
at
the
school
i
gradually
overcame
the
prejudices
of
the
students
and
gained
their
good
will
while
he
was
always
giving
offence
by
his
meddlesome
disposition
and
overbearing
manners
yet
his
talents
and
force
of
character
always
procured
him
a
few
followers
whom
he
managed
as
he
pleased
of
their
aid
he
made
use
to
gratify
his
malevolence
towards
me
for
this
feeling
had
grown
with
his
growth
and
now
seemed
to
be
the
master
passion
of
his
breast
i
was
able
to
trace
the
result
of
their
machinations
every
where
sometimes
it
was
intimated
to
the
teachers
that
i
had
been
assisted
in
my
exercises
at
others
that
i
had
infringed
the
college
rules
or
had
put
false
reports
in
circulation
or
had
neglected
some
of
the
many
ceremonies
required
by
our
religion
this
was
their
favourite
as
well
as
the
most
efficient
mode
of
attack
as
in
these
respects
there
was
some
colour
for
their
accusation
in
my
early
childhood
i
had
been
spared
by
the
tenderest
of
mothers
from
many
of
the
ablutions
practised
by
the
hindoos
under
the
belief
that
they
would
be
injurious
to
my
constitution
which
though
healthy
had
never
been
robust
a
foundation
was
thus
laid
with
me
for
habitual
remissness
in
these
ceremonies
and
after
i
grew
up
i
persuaded
myself
that
they
were
of
less
importance
than
they
were
deemed
by
my
countrymen
my
chief
delight
had
ever
been
in
books
and
although
when
engaged
in
active
pursuits
i
took
a
lively
interest
in
them
for
the
time
i
always
returned
to
my
first
love
with
unabated
ardour
some
of
these
accusations
being
utterly
groundless
i
was
able
to
disprove
but
the
few
that
were
true
i
endeavoured
to
excuse
and
thus
by
their
admission
credit
was
procured
for
their
most
unfounded
calumny
these
petty
transgressions
for
i
can
not
even
now
regard
them
as
sins
industriously
reported
and
artfully
exaggerated
did
me
lasting
injury
with
all
the
most
pious
of
our
caste
the
charitable
portion
indeed
were
merely
estranged
from
me
but
the
more
bigoted
part
began
to
regard
me
with
aversion
and
horror
in
one
of
our
vacations
my
father
allowed
me
to
visit
a
brother
of
his
who
lived
in
the
country
about
thirty
miles
from
benares
my
uncle
had
two
sons
of
nearly
my
own
age
and
several
daughters
with
the
former
i
rode
played
chess
and
engaged
in
such
sports
as
are
not
forbidden
to
my
profession
but
my
female
cousins
i
seldom
saw
as
they
rarely
left
their
zenana
into
which
i
was
not
permitted
to
enter
i
was
of
an
age
to
be
desirous
of
becoming
better
acquainted
with
my
female
cousins
especially
after
i
learnt
that
they
then
had
as
guests
a
lady
and
her
daughter
who
had
come
to
pass
some
weeks
here
during
the
absence
of
her
husband
then
employed
in
some
public
mission
to
calcutta
but
it
was
only
now
and
then
that
i
had
been
able
to
catch
a
transient
and
distant
view
of
these
females
during
the
first
week
after
my
arrival
and
the
little
i
saw
served
but
to
increase
my
curiosity
chance
however
soon
afforded
me
the
means
of
gratifying
it
an
important
festival
in
our
calendar
was
now
approaching
and
preparations
were
made
to
celebrate
it
in
various
modes
and
amongst
others
by
a
fight
between
a
tiger
and
an
elephant
for
several
days
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
in
my
uncle
family
howdahs
newly
gilded
and
painted
were
provided
for
the
elephants
new
caparisons
for
the
horses
new
liveries
for
the
attendants
cloth
and
silk
of
the
richest
dyes
and
hues
united
with
a
profusion
of
gold
and
silver
ornaments
to
dazzle
the
eye
with
their
varied
splendour
this
was
one
of
those
exhibitions
which
those
who
were
intended
for
the
priesthood
were
prohibited
from
attending
i
confess
when
i
witnessed
these
showy
and
costly
preparations
and
pictured
to
myself
the
magnificent
scene
for
which
they
were
intended
those
formidable
animals
contending
in
mortal
conflict
the
thousands
of
gaily
dressed
spectators
gazing
in
breathless
anxiety
i
repined
at
my
lot
and
regretted
i
had
not
been
born
in
a
condition
which
though
of
less
dignity
would
not
have
cut
me
off
from
some
of
the
most
exquisite
pleasures
of
life
at
length
the
important
day
arrived
and
i
found
my
mortification
so
acute
that
i
determined
to
withdraw
myself
as
much
as
i
could
from
a
scene
that
i
could
not
witness
without
pain
among
my
acquirements
at
college
was
a
knowledge
of
your
language
and
i
had
now
begun
to
take
the
liveliest
interest
in
its
beautiful
fictions
which
i
greatly
preferred
to
ours
as
being
more
true
to
nature
and
as
exhibiting
women
in
characters
at
once
lovely
pure
and
elevated
i
was
then
reading
the
vicar
of
wakefield
and
had
reached
the
middle
of
that
interesting
tale
on
the
morning
of
the
festival
when
my
tranquillity
was
interrupted
in
the
way
i
have
mentioned
accordingly
taking
my
book
and
english
dictionary
i
retired
to
a
small
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
and
determined
to
remain
there
till
the
cavalcade
had
set
out
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
fix
my
attention
on
what
i
read
but
after
a
while
the
interest
the
book
had
previously
excited
returned
and
i
became
at
length
so
engrossed
by
the
incidents
of
the
story
as
to
forget
the
festival
the
procession
the
tiger
and
the
elephant
as
much
as
if
they
had
never
before
entered
my
head
after
some
hours
passed
in
this
intellectual
banquet
i
waked
from
my
day
dream
and
i
thought
again
of
the
spectacle
with
a
feeling
bordering
on
indifference
i
walked
towards
the
house
where
all
appeared
to
be
still
and
silent
as
a
desert
i
entered
it
and
of
the
forty
or
fifty
menials
belonging
to
it
not
one
was
to
be
seen
those
who
were
not
in
attendance
on
the
family
had
sought
some
respite
from
their
ordinary
labours
the
zenana
then
caught
my
eye
and
i
felt
irresistibly
impelled
to
enter
it
i
used
great
caution
however
looking
around
me
in
every
direction
as
i
proceeded
there
i
found
the
same
silence
and
desertion
as
in
the
other
parts
of
the
mansion
i
passed
through
a
into
a
long
gallery
with
which
the
of
the
ladies
communicated
the
doors
were
all
open
and
the
whole
interior
of
their
apartments
exhibited
so
strange
a
medley
of
unseemly
objects
and
such
utter
disorder
as
materially
to
affect
my
opinion
of
female
delicacy
and
to
damp
my
desire
of
becoming
acquainted
with
my
cousins
i
passed
on
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
bordering
on
disgust
when
i
came
to
a
room
which
went
far
to
redeem
the
character
of
the
sex
in
my
estimation
here
all
was
neatness
and
propriety
every
thing
was
either
in
place
or
only
enough
out
of
it
to
indicate
the
recent
occupation
of
the
room
or
to
show
the
taste
or
talent
of
the
occupant
such
as
a
book
left
half
open
at
one
end
of
an
ottoman
and
a
piece
of
embroidery
at
the
other
the
flowers
too
which
decorated
the
room
showed
by
their
freshness
that
they
had
not
long
left
their
beds
i
could
not
help
stopping
to
survey
a
scene
which
accorded
so
well
with
my
previous
notions
of
female
refinement
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
was
a
veranda
facing
the
east
and
surrounded
by
lattices
in
this
were
a
number
of
arranged
with
the
same
air
of
neatness
and
taste
as
had
been
conspicuous
in
the
chamber
i
entered
it
for
the
purpose
of
looking
into
the
with
which
it
communicated
and
on
approaching
the
lattice
i
saw
seated
in
an
alcove
not
far
from
the
veranda
a
face
and
form
that
struck
me
as
being
the
most
beautiful
i
had
ever
beheld
i
remained
for
some
time
riveted
to
the
spot
but
soon
found
myself
irresistibly
impelled
to
get
a
nearer
view
of
the
lovely
object
with
as
light
a
step
and
as
little
noise
as
possible
i
descended
into
the
garden
from
the
veranda
and
approaching
the
alcove
on
the
side
where
its
foliage
was
thickest
i
found
that
the
beauty
of
which
i
had
before
thought
so
highly
did
not
appear
less
on
a
closer
survey
the
vision
on
which
i
gazed
in
silent
rapture
a
maiden
who
though
she
had
apparently
attained
her
full
stature
did
not
seem
to
be
more
than
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
her
eyes
had
the
brightness
and
fulness
of
the
antelope
but
owing
to
their
long
silken
lashes
were
yet
more
expressive
of
softness
than
of
spirit
and
at
this
time
they
evinced
more
than
usual
languor
she
was
in
a
rich
undress
and
was
apparently
an
invalid
her
long
raven
locks
hung
with
careless
grace
partly
behind
and
partly
over
a
neck
that
might
have
served
as
a
model
for
the
sculptor
she
was
looking
wistfully
on
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
her
hand
which
i
felt
pleasure
in
recognising
to
be
the
same
i
had
seen
on
the
piece
of
embroidery
i
feared
to
advance
lest
i
should
give
offence
but
i
felt
also
unable
to
retreat
i
fancied
i
saw
one
of
those
lovely
and
dignified
females
which
the
writers
in
your
language
describe
so
well
but
a
sudden
movement
of
the
fair
damsel
to
get
up
bringing
me
full
in
her
view
she
started
back
with
alarm
and
surprise
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
her
cheek
which
had
been
before
pale
almost
to
european
whiteness
was
deeply
suffused
i
respectfully
approached
her
and
inquired
if
she
was
one
of
my
cousins
she
answered
in
the
negative
said
she
was
on
a
visit
to
the
family
to
whom
she
was
related
added
that
she
had
not
expected
to
see
any
one
in
the
garden
but
this
was
said
as
if
she
meant
rather
to
apologise
for
her
undress
than
to
reproach
me
for
my
intrusion
these
remarks
were
uttered
with
a
propriety
and
sweetness
that
won
upon
me
yet
more
than
her
beauty
i
then
in
return
assured
her
that
i
had
not
supposed
any
of
the
family
had
remained
at
home
when
i
strolled
to
this
part
of
the
mansion
i
begged
she
would
not
regard
me
with
the
formality
of
a
stranger
and
insisted
that
as
she
was
the
cousin
of
my
relation
she
was
also
mine
to
this
ingenious
argument
she
answered
with
so
much
good
sense
and
at
the
same
time
so
much
gentleness
and
artlessness
that
i
thought
i
could
have
listened
to
her
for
ever
while
i
spoke
she
continued
to
move
on
i
entreated
to
know
if
she
was
satisfied
with
my
apology
repeated
that
i
had
not
meant
to
intrude
on
her
privacy
she
mildly
replied
that
she
was
i
then
asked
permission
to
call
her
cousin
she
said
she
should
not
object
if
it
would
gave
me
pleasure
it
was
my
dear
atterley
her
ineffable
sweetness
of
disposition
and
of
manners
so
entirely
free
from
pride
coquetry
or
affectation
in
which
this
lovely
creature
excelled
all
other
women
yet
more
than
in
beauty
and
grace
i
then
inquired
when
i
should
again
see
my
lovely
cousin
she
replied
i
walk
in
the
great
garden
sometimes
with
my
companions
when
their
brothers
are
away
but
the
girls
will
not
think
it
proper
to
walk
when
you
are
there
perceiving
that
i
looked
chagrined
she
added
it
is
said
you
know
that
the
light
from
mens
eyes
is
yet
worse
for
faces
than
the
light
of
the
sun
and
she
blushed
as
if
she
had
said
something
wrong
i
stammered
out
i
know
not
what
extravagant
compliment
in
reply
and
entreated
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
her
sometimes
to
which
she
promptly
answered
that
she
should
not
object
if
her
mother
approved
it
i
inquired
why
she
had
not
attended
the
exhibition
when
i
learnt
from
her
that
as
she
had
been
slightly
indisposed
the
day
before
and
her
mother
being
unwilling
she
should
expose
herself
to
the
heat
of
the
weather
and
the
crowd
she
had
been
left
under
the
care
of
her
nurse
but
that
finding
herself
better
she
had
permitted
her
attendants
to
walk
over
the
grounds
while
she
amused
herself
in
embroidery
and
that
she
had
come
into
the
garden
to
get
a
fresh
supply
of
the
flowers
she
was
working
she
had
by
this
time
approached
a
small
gate
which
communicated
with
the
apartments
on
the
of
the
zenana
when
turning
to
me
she
said
you
can
return
the
way
you
came
but
i
must
leave
you
here
and
making
a
slight
bow
she
sprung
like
a
young
fawn
through
the
gate
and
was
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
you
may
wonder
my
dear
atterley
that
i
should
remember
all
these
minute
circumstances
after
the
lapse
of
more
than
forty
years
but
every
incident
of
that
day
is
as
fresh
in
my
memory
as
the
occurrence
of
yesterday
to
this
single
green
spot
in
my
existence
my
mind
is
never
tired
of
returning
i
continued
for
some
time
in
a
sort
of
dreaming
ecstasy
but
as
soon
as
i
collected
my
thoughts
i
began
to
devise
some
scheme
by
which
i
could
again
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
the
lovely
veenah
my
brain
had
before
that
time
teemed
with
ambitious
projects
of
distinguishing
myself
sometimes
as
a
priest
sometimes
as
a
writer
and
occasionally
i
thought
i
would
bend
all
my
efforts
to
rouse
my
countrymen
to
throw
off
the
ignominious
yoke
of
great
britain
but
this
short
interview
had
changed
the
whole
current
of
my
thoughts
i
had
now
a
new
set
of
feelings
opinions
and
wishes
my
mind
dwelt
solely
upon
the
pleasures
of
domestic
life
the
surpassing
bliss
of
loving
and
of
being
beloved
when
the
cavalcade
returned
in
the
evening
its
gaudy
magnificence
which
i
would
not
permit
myself
even
to
see
in
the
morning
i
now
regarded
with
cold
indifference
nay
more
i
congratulated
myself
on
having
missed
the
exhibition
though
a
few
hours
before
i
had
deemed
this
privation
one
of
the
misfortunes
of
my
life
the
next
day
i
went
to
the
garden
betimes
and
as
it
communicated
with
the
shrubbery
and
grounds
attached
to
the
zenana
and
the
males
of
the
family
occasionally
entered
it
when
the
ladies
were
not
present
i
prevailed
on
the
gardener
to
grant
me
admission
under
the
pretext
of
gathering
some
uncommonly
fine
mangoes
which
were
then
ripe
i
went
to
the
several
spots
where
i
had
first
seen
veenah
where
i
had
conversed
with
her
where
i
had
parted
from
her
and
they
each
had
some
secret
and
indescribable
charm
for
me
i
fear
atterley
i
fatigue
you
the
feelings
of
which
i
speak
are
fully
known
only
to
the
natives
of
warm
climates
and
to
those
but
once
in
their
lives
i
assured
him
that
he
was
mistaken
that
the
emotions
he
described
were
the
same
in
all
countries
and
at
all
times
and
begged
him
to
proceed
i
repeated
my
visit
he
continued
several
times
the
same
day
under
any
pretext
i
could
invent
to
gather
an
orange
or
other
fruit
to
pluck
a
rose
to
frighten
away
mischievous
birds
to
catch
the
unobstructed
breeze
or
sit
in
a
cooler
shade
in
which
artifices
i
played
a
part
that
had
before
been
foreign
to
my
nature
i
was
disappointed
however
in
my
wishes
i
thought
indeed
i
once
saw
some
one
in
the
veranda
looking
through
the
lattice
into
the
garden
but
the
figure
soon
disappeared
on
the
following
day
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
hear
my
young
companions
propose
to
go
on
a
fishing
party
an
amusement
in
which
by
the
rules
of
my
caste
i
was
not
allowed
to
partake
they
had
scarcely
left
the
house
before
i
flew
to
the
garden
with
a
book
in
my
hand
and
passing
as
before
to
the
shrubbery
i
buried
myself
in
a
close
thicket
at
one
end
of
it
i
remained
there
from
the
morning
till
late
in
the
afternoon
without
refreshment
of
any
kind
and
such
was
the
intensity
of
my
emotion
that
i
did
not
feel
the
want
of
it
at
length
a
little
before
sunset
i
saw
veenah
and
her
three
cousins
enter
the
garden
i
soon
contrived
to
show
myself
with
my
book
in
my
hand
i
approached
bowed
to
them
all
but
to
veenah
last
and
although
my
cousins
showed
surprise
at
seeing
me
in
their
garden
at
this
time
they
did
not
seem
displeased
i
felt
very
desirous
i
could
not
tell
why
to
conceal
my
feelings
from
every
person
except
her
who
was
the
object
of
them
i
forced
a
conversation
with
my
two
eldest
cousins
who
were
modest
pleasing
girls
and
then
with
an
embarrassed
air
addressed
a
few
words
to
veenah
and
her
companion
the
youngest
of
my
cousins
occasionally
i
would
stray
off
from
them
as
if
i
was
about
to
leave
them
and
then
suddenly
return
in
one
of
these
movements
i
perceived
that
veenah
and
her
associate
had
separated
from
the
others
and
strolled
to
a
distant
part
of
the
garden
i
soon
joined
them
as
if
it
were
by
accident
entered
into
conversation
with
them
alternately
and
of
course
only
one
half
of
that
which
i
either
heard
or
said
proceeded
from
the
heart
or
found
its
way
thither
i
know
not
if
veenah
expected
to
see
me
but
she
was
dressed
with
unusual
care
we
had
not
been
conversing
many
minutes
before
the
eldest
sister
beckoning
to
them
they
bid
me
good
night
and
returned
to
the
house
to
the
same
sort
of
management
i
had
recourse
every
day
and
seldom
failed
to
see
and
converse
with
veenah
sometimes
in
company
with
all
her
cousins
but
oftener
with
fatima
the
youngest
by
dividing
my
attentions
among
them
all
i
succeeded
for
a
while
in
concealing
from
them
the
object
of
my
preference
but
the
sex
are
too
to
be
long
deceived
in
these
matters
as
soon
as
i
perceived
that
my
secret
was
discovered
i
endeavoured
to
make
a
friend
of
fatima
in
which
i
was
successful
after
this
our
meetings
were
more
frequent
and
what
was
of
greater
importance
they
were
uninterrupted
fatima
who
was
one
of
the
most
generous
and
amiable
girls
in
the
world
would
often
take
veenah
out
to
walk
when
her
sisters
were
otherwise
engaged
at
which
times
she
was
perpetually
contriving
under
some
little
pretext
to
leave
us
alone
we
were
not
long
in
understanding
each
other
and
when
i
urged
our
early
marriage
she
ingenuously
replied
that
i
had
her
consent
whenever
i
had
her
father
and
that
she
hoped
i
could
obtain
that
but
added
and
she
trembled
while
she
spoke
she
did
not
know
his
views
respecting
her
in
the
first
raptures
of
requited
affection
what
lover
thinks
of
difficulties
in
obtaining
veenah
heart
i
believed
that
all
mine
were
at
an
end
and
my
time
was
passed
in
one
dream
of
unmixed
delight
oh
what
happiness
i
enjoyed
in
these
interviews
in
seeing
veenah
in
gazing
on
her
lovely
features
in
listening
to
her
sentiments
that
were
sometimes
gay
and
thoughtless
sometimes
serious
and
melancholy
but
always
tender
and
affectionate
and
now
and
then
when
not
perceived
in
venturing
to
take
her
hand
these
fleeting
joys
are
ever
recurring
to
my
imagination
to
show
me
what
my
lot
might
have
been
and
to
contrast
it
with
its
sad
reverse
the
time
now
approached
for
veenah
and
her
mother
to
return
to
benares
on
the
evening
before
they
set
out
fatima
contrived
for
us
a
longer
interview
than
usual
it
was
as
melancholy
as
it
was
tender
but
in
the
midst
of
my
grief
at
the
prospect
of
our
separation
i
recollected
that
we
were
soon
to
meet
again
in
the
city
while
veenah
tears
for
she
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
or
suppress
her
feelings
seemed
already
to
forebode
that
our
happiness
was
here
to
terminate
when
about
to
part
we
exchanged
amaranths
i
took
her
hand
to
bid
her
adieu
and
without
seeming
to
intend
it
our
lips
met
and
the
first
kiss
of
love
was
moistened
with
a
tear
pardon
me
atterley
nature
will
have
her
way
and
here
the
venerable
man
wept
aloud
i
availed
myself
of
this
interruption
to
the
narrative
to
propose
to
my
venerable
friend
to
take
some
refreshment
having
partaken
of
a
frugal
repast
and
invigorated
ourselves
each
with
about
four
hours
sleep
the
brahmin
thus
resumed
his
story
chapter
xvii
brahmin
story
continued
the
voyage
concluded
atterley
and
the
brahmin
separate
atterley
arrives
in
new
i
was
not
slow
to
follow
veenah
to
the
city
and
as
had
been
agreed
upon
had
to
ask
the
consent
of
her
father
to
our
union
as
soon
as
i
had
obtained
the
approbation
of
my
own
here
i
met
with
a
difficulty
which
i
had
not
expected
my
partial
father
had
formed
very
high
hopes
of
my
future
advancement
and
thought
that
an
early
marriage
though
not
incompatible
with
my
profession
or
a
successful
discharge
of
its
duties
would
put
an
end
to
my
ambition
or
at
all
events
lessen
my
exertions
he
first
urged
me
to
postpone
my
wishes
till
i
had
completed
my
college
course
and
had
by
travelling
seen
something
of
the
world
but
finding
me
immoveable
on
this
point
he
then
suggested
that
i
might
meet
with
serious
obstacles
from
veenah
father
whom
he
represented
as
remarkable
both
for
his
avarice
and
his
bigotry
that
consequently
he
was
likely
to
dispose
of
his
daughter
to
the
who
could
pay
most
liberally
for
her
and
that
the
imputations
which
had
been
cast
on
my
religious
creed
would
reach
his
ears
if
they
had
not
already
done
so
and
be
sure
to
prejudice
him
against
me
these
last
considerations
prevailed
on
me
to
defer
my
application
to
shunah
shoo
until
the
suspicions
regarding
my
faith
had
either
died
away
or
been
falsified
by
my
scrupulous
observance
of
all
religious
duties
my
excellent
mother
who
at
first
had
entered
into
my
feelings
and
seconded
my
views
readily
acquiesced
in
the
good
sense
of
my
father
advice
my
next
object
was
to
communicate
this
to
veenah
i
accordingly
sat
down
and
wrote
a
full
account
of
all
that
had
occurred
and
folding
up
the
packet
hurried
to
the
opposite
quarter
of
the
town
where
shunah
shoo
lived
it
was
then
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
i
was
fearful
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
be
recognised
but
after
i
had
taken
two
or
three
turns
in
the
street
i
saw
the
white
amaranth
i
had
given
veenah
suspended
by
a
thread
from
the
lattice
of
an
upper
window
i
immediately
held
up
the
packet
and
soon
afterwards
a
cord
was
let
down
from
the
same
lattice
to
the
ground
to
this
i
hastily
fastened
the
paper
and
passed
on
to
avoid
observation
the
next
evening
you
may
be
sure
i
was
at
the
same
spot
the
little
amaranth
again
announced
that
i
was
recognised
and
as
soon
as
we
were
satisfied
that
no
one
was
observing
us
the
cord
let
down
one
letter
and
took
up
another
veenah
pen
had
given
an
expression
to
her
feelings
that
her
tongue
had
never
ventured
to
do
before
she
moreover
commended
my
course
besought
me
to
be
prudent
and
above
all
to
do
nothing
to
offend
her
father
the
first
letter
which
a
lover
receives
from
his
mistress
is
a
new
era
in
his
life
again
and
again
i
kissed
the
precious
paper
and
almost
wore
it
out
in
my
bosom
we
afterwards
improved
in
this
mode
of
intercourse
and
by
various
preconcerted
signals
were
able
to
carry
on
our
correspondence
altogether
in
the
night
not
a
day
passed
that
we
did
not
exchange
letters
which
though
they
contained
few
facts
and
always
expressed
the
same
sentiments
still
repeated
what
we
were
never
tired
of
hearing
to
the
moment
at
which
i
was
to
receive
a
letter
from
veenah
my
thoughts
were
continually
and
anxiously
turned
and
it
now
seems
to
me
as
if
our
passion
was
inflamed
yet
more
by
this
sort
of
intercourse
than
by
our
personal
interviews
i
am
convinced
it
wrought
more
powerfully
upon
our
imaginations
in
the
mean
time
i
continued
my
daily
attendance
at
college
though
my
studies
were
utterly
neglected
one
single
object
absorbing
all
my
thoughts
and
feelings
i
know
not
whether
the
evident
change
in
my
habits
induced
my
old
enemy
balty
mahu
to
observe
my
motions
but
so
it
was
that
one
moonlight
night
i
thought
i
was
watched
by
some
person
and
on
the
following
night
an
individual
of
the
same
figure
and
whom
i
now
suspected
to
be
balty
mahu
came
suddenly
from
a
cross
street
and
passed
near
me
a
few
evenings
afterwards
instead
of
a
letter
i
received
a
scrap
of
paper
from
veenah
on
which
was
written
the
following
words
we
are
discovered
balty
mahu
who
is
my
relative
and
your
enemy
has
been
here
he
has
persuaded
my
father
that
you
are
an
unbeliever
i
am
denied
pen
and
ink
if
you
can
not
convince
my
father
of
his
error
o
pity
and
try
to
forget
your
unhappy
veenah
this
writing
was
indistinctly
traced
with
a
burnt
stick
on
a
blank
leaf
torn
out
of
a
book
in
the
first
moment
of
indignation
i
felt
disposed
to
seek
balty
mahu
the
great
enemy
of
my
life
and
wreak
my
vengeance
on
him
for
all
his
persecutions
but
the
conviction
that
such
a
course
would
extinguish
the
last
spark
of
hope
restrained
me
i
then
determined
to
see
shunah
shoo
and
endeavour
to
remove
his
prejudices
i
accordingly
called
on
him
at
his
own
house
but
after
he
had
heard
my
vindication
to
which
he
evidently
gave
no
credit
he
coolly
told
me
that
he
meant
to
dispose
of
his
daughter
in
another
way
the
words
fell
like
ice
upon
my
heart
i
expostulated
and
offensive
as
was
his
haughty
air
even
had
recourse
to
entreaty
but
he
in
a
yet
harsher
manner
told
me
that
he
must
be
permitted
to
manage
his
own
affairs
in
his
own
way
and
added
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
longer
prevented
from
attending
to
them
i
was
compelled
to
retire
with
my
heart
almost
as
full
of
hatred
for
the
father
as
of
love
for
the
child
on
the
same
night
i
again
betook
myself
to
the
street
in
which
shunah
shoo
lived
but
not
by
the
ordinary
route
i
cautiously
approached
his
house
all
was
stillness
and
quiet
no
light
appeared
to
be
burning
in
veenah
room
nor
indeed
in
any
other
part
of
the
house
i
hence
concluded
that
they
had
now
deprived
her
of
light
as
well
as
of
pen
and
ink
i
continued
in
the
street
until
near
morning
straining
my
eyes
and
ears
in
the
hope
of
catching
something
that
would
give
me
intelligence
concerning
her
often
in
the
course
of
that
painful
suspense
did
i
fancy
i
heard
a
noise
at
the
lattice
in
veenah
apartment
or
in
some
other
part
of
the
mansion
and
once
i
persuaded
myself
i
saw
a
light
but
these
illusions
served
only
to
aggravate
my
disappointment
the
next
morning
before
i
had
left
my
room
my
father
informed
me
that
shunah
shoo
with
his
family
had
left
benares
early
the
preceding
evening
but
whither
they
had
gone
he
had
not
learnt
i
rose
and
immediately
set
about
discovering
their
course
but
all
i
could
learn
was
that
they
had
embarked
in
one
of
the
which
ply
on
the
ganges
and
that
shunah
had
taken
his
palanquins
and
many
of
his
servants
with
him
and
as
balty
mahu
had
suddenly
absented
himself
from
college
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
aided
in
executing
the
plan
which
he
had
also
probably
formed
my
father
who
saw
what
i
suffered
spared
no
pains
to
discover
the
place
of
their
retreat
but
our
endeavours
were
all
ineffectual
at
the
end
of
three
months
in
which
time
my
anxiety
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
mystery
was
dispelled
it
was
now
trumpeted
through
the
city
that
shunah
shoo
had
returned
to
benares
in
great
pomp
accompanied
by
a
wealthy
omrah
of
a
neighbouring
district
to
whom
he
had
given
or
rather
sold
his
daughter
the
news
came
upon
me
like
a
clap
of
thunder
my
previous
state
of
suspense
was
happiness
compared
with
what
i
now
felt
when
i
knew
she
was
in
the
arms
of
another
in
the
first
transports
of
my
grief
and
rage
i
could
have
freely
put
to
death
the
father
daughter
husband
and
myself
i
was
particularly
desirous
of
seeing
veenah
and
venting
on
her
the
bitterest
reproaches
unjust
that
i
was
her
sufferings
were
not
inferior
to
mine
but
she
had
not
like
me
the
privilege
of
making
them
known
i
soon
found
that
hircarrahs
in
the
pay
of
balty
mahu
watched
all
my
motions
and
if
i
had
attempted
any
scheme
of
vengeance
its
execution
would
have
been
impracticable
after
my
first
transports
had
subsided
into
deep
and
settled
grief
my
love
and
tenderness
for
veenah
returned
in
full
force
i
endeavoured
to
get
a
sight
of
her
and
thought
i
should
be
comparatively
happy
if
i
could
converse
with
her
as
formerly
though
she
was
the
wife
of
another
after
a
short
time
my
uncle
family
came
to
benares
on
a
visit
to
my
father
and
to
shunah
shoo
by
the
aid
of
my
indulgent
mother
who
was
seriously
alarmed
for
what
she
saw
i
suffered
i
was
able
to
see
fatima
and
to
make
her
the
bearer
of
a
letter
to
veenah
complaining
of
her
breach
of
faith
and
soliciting
an
interview
she
verbally
replied
to
it
through
fatima
and
stated
in
her
justification
that
she
was
hurried
from
benares
to
a
town
on
the
river
whence
she
was
rapidly
transported
to
the
castle
of
omrah
who
had
not
long
before
lost
his
wife
and
who
was
more
than
four
times
her
age
that
notwithstanding
the
notions
of
filial
obedience
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
and
the
severity
with
which
her
father
had
ever
exercised
his
authority
she
had
resisted
his
commands
on
this
occasion
and
would
have
preferred
death
to
marrying
the
omrah
nay
would
have
inflicted
it
on
herself
but
that
finding
her
unyielding
after
all
their
exertions
they
had
effected
their
purpose
by
a
deception
which
they
had
practised
on
her
wherein
it
seemed
that
i
had
unconsciously
concurred
for
by
means
of
an
intercepted
letter
of
mine
to
fatima
in
which
hopeless
of
learning
the
place
of
veenah
retreat
i
had
expressed
an
intention
of
visiting
england
and
by
the
farther
aid
of
some
dexterous
forgeries
calculated
to
impose
on
more
experienced
minds
than
hers
they
succeeded
in
persuading
her
that
i
had
actually
set
out
for
europe
with
an
intention
of
never
returning
that
entertaining
no
doubt
of
this
intelligence
hopeless
of
ever
seeing
me
again
and
indifferent
to
every
thing
besides
she
had
been
led
an
unresisting
victim
to
the
altar
such
was
the
vindication
which
she
considered
it
just
to
make
me
but
all
the
entreaties
of
fatima
all
my
letters
impassioned
as
they
were
appealing
at
once
to
her
generosity
humanity
and
love
could
not
prevail
on
her
to
grant
me
an
interview
him
said
she
heaven
has
forbid
it
and
to
its
decrees
we
are
bound
to
submit
i
am
now
the
wife
of
another
and
it
is
our
duty
to
forget
all
that
is
past
but
if
this
be
possible
my
heart
tells
me
it
can
be
only
by
our
never
meeting
in
saying
this
she
wept
bitterly
but
at
the
same
time
exacted
a
promise
from
fatima
that
she
would
never
mention
the
subject
to
her
again
finding
her
thus
inexorable
i
fell
into
a
settled
melancholy
and
my
health
was
visibly
declining
the
europeans
consider
the
natives
of
hindostan
to
be
feeble
and
effeminate
but
the
soul
that
which
distinguishes
man
from
brutes
acts
with
an
intensity
and
constancy
of
purpose
of
which
they
can
furnish
no
examples
how
long
i
could
have
withstood
the
corrosive
effects
of
my
hopeless
passion
irritated
as
it
was
by
my
being
in
the
vicinity
of
its
object
by
hearing
perpetually
of
her
beauty
and
sometimes
catching
a
glimpse
of
it
i
know
not
but
the
omrah
after
a
few
months
spent
with
his
returned
with
his
bride
to
his
castle
in
the
country
yielding
now
to
the
wishes
of
my
anxious
parents
i
consented
to
travel
i
was
at
first
benefited
by
the
exercise
and
change
of
scene
but
after
a
while
my
melancholy
returned
and
my
health
grew
worse
though
indifferent
to
life
itself
and
all
that
it
now
promised
i
exerted
myself
for
the
sake
of
my
parents
especially
of
my
mother
who
suffered
so
acutely
on
my
account
but
i
carried
a
barbed
arrow
in
my
heart
and
the
greater
the
efforts
to
extract
it
the
more
they
rankled
the
wound
after
spending
more
than
a
year
in
travelling
first
through
the
mountainous
district
of
our
country
and
then
along
the
coast
and
finding
no
change
for
the
better
i
determined
to
try
the
effect
of
a
sea
voyage
i
accordingly
embarked
at
calcutta
in
a
coasting
vessel
that
was
bound
to
madras
at
this
time
i
had
wasted
away
to
a
mere
skeleton
and
no
one
who
saw
me
believed
i
could
live
a
month
such
indeed
were
my
own
impressions
in
the
letter
which
i
wrote
to
my
parents
i
endeavoured
to
prepare
them
for
the
worst
when
after
a
long
voyage
we
reached
madras
my
health
was
evidently
improved
but
a
piece
of
intelligence
i
here
received
had
perhaps
a
still
greater
effect
i
learnt
that
balty
mahu
who
had
kept
himself
concealed
from
me
before
i
left
benares
had
lately
visited
madras
on
a
travelling
tour
this
news
operated
on
me
like
a
charm
the
idea
of
avenging
myself
on
the
author
of
all
my
calamities
infused
new
life
into
my
exhausted
frame
and
from
the
moment
that
i
determined
to
pursue
him
i
felt
like
another
man
you
must
not
however
suppose
that
i
even
then
entertained
the
purpose
of
taking
away
my
enemy
life
no
i
could
not
bring
my
mind
exactly
to
that
but
i
had
a
vague
undefined
hope
that
if
we
met
some
new
provocation
on
his
part
would
afford
me
just
occasion
for
avenging
myself
on
all
so
ingenious
my
dear
friend
is
the
sophistry
of
the
passions
i
lost
no
time
in
setting
out
on
the
track
of
balty
mahu
and
ere
many
days
overtook
him
at
a
small
town
which
he
had
left
just
as
i
entered
it
but
not
before
he
had
received
through
his
servant
notice
of
my
arrival
my
wary
enemy
who
had
little
expected
to
see
me
here
and
who
had
travelled
as
much
to
keep
out
of
my
way
as
to
see
the
country
conjectured
my
purpose
from
the
consciousness
of
what
he
had
done
to
provoke
it
thus
while
we
both
appeared
to
others
to
be
merely
making
a
tour
of
hindostan
it
was
soon
known
to
both
of
us
that
my
chief
purpose
was
to
pursue
him
and
his
to
elude
my
pursuit
in
the
ardour
as
well
as
exercise
of
the
chase
my
health
mended
rapidly
but
i
was
no
nearer
the
object
of
my
pursuit
for
although
i
travelled
somewhat
faster
than
bally
mahu
as
he
wished
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
flying
from
me
he
sometimes
contrived
to
put
me
on
a
wrong
track
in
this
way
i
was
once
led
to
travel
towards
the
coast
while
he
proceeded
in
an
opposite
direction
to
benares
where
he
considered
he
would
be
most
safe
from
my
vengeance
and
where
the
restraints
both
of
religion
and
law
would
be
more
likely
to
operate
on
me
than
in
a
foreign
district
my
usual
practice
on
arriving
at
any
town
was
to
endeavour
to
learn
if
balty
mahu
had
passed
through
it
if
so
when
and
in
what
direction
and
to
get
the
information
if
possible
without
seeming
to
seek
it
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
heard
from
a
party
of
merchants
that
the
omrah
addaway
whose
health
had
been
declining
for
some
time
had
gone
to
benares
for
the
benefit
of
medical
advice
that
his
disease
however
had
become
more
serious
and
that
it
was
generally
thought
it
would
soon
occasion
his
death
what
a
train
of
new
thoughts
hopes
and
desires
did
this
intelligence
excite
in
me
at
first
influenced
by
the
custom
of
my
country
which
prohibits
widows
from
marrying
again
i
thought
only
of
the
pleasure
of
veenah
society
which
i
should
of
course
be
permitted
to
enjoy
when
duty
no
longer
forbade
it
but
my
imagination
kindling
in
its
course
i
soon
pictured
her
to
myself
as
my
wife
the
usages
which
stood
in
the
way
of
our
union
appeared
to
me
barbarous
and
absurd
and
i
thought
that
banishment
from
my
country
with
veenah
would
be
infinitely
better
than
any
other
condition
of
life
without
her
these
visions
so
entirely
absorbed
me
that
balty
mahu
was
entirely
forgotten
or
remembered
only
as
we
think
of
an
insect
which
had
stung
us
an
hour
before
i
travelled
on
at
a
yet
more
rapid
rate
than
i
had
done
and
without
stopping
on
the
road
to
make
inquiries
i
heard
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
the
omrah
could
not
long
survive
when
within
something
more
than
ten
leagues
of
benares
i
called
about
twilight
at
a
small
inn
and
meant
after
refreshing
myself
with
a
few
hours
rest
to
proceed
on
my
journey
two
travellers
were
there
who
had
just
left
benares
and
had
taken
up
their
quarters
for
the
night
they
soon
fell
into
conversation
about
the
place
they
had
left
when
the
mention
of
shunah
shoo
name
excited
my
attention
a
shame
said
one
he
should
have
sacrificed
that
beautiful
young
creature
to
the
rich
old
omrah
when
she
had
so
good
an
offer
as
gurameer
the
brahmin
gafawad
only
son
is
it
not
strange
said
the
other
a
woman
so
young
and
beautiful
should
be
content
to
follow
to
the
grave
one
who
is
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
and
whom
she
once
loathed
but
i
suppose
that
that
old
miser
shunah
shoo
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
as
he
deprived
her
of
the
man
she
loved
he
has
compelled
her
to
sacrifice
herself
to
the
one
she
hates
that
he
may
have
her
jewels
and
wealth
that
matter
said
the
first
shunah
shoo
is
bad
enough
for
any
thing
where
money
is
in
the
way
yet
it
is
said
that
veenah
goes
to
the
funeral
pile
of
her
own
accord
she
has
never
seemed
to
set
any
value
on
life
since
her
marriage
and
after
she
heard
of
death
she
has
never
been
seen
to
smile
poor
young
man
and
here
they
launched
out
into
a
strain
of
panegyric
which
is
often
bestowed
on
the
dead
but
i
heeded
only
the
first
part
of
their
discourse
had
it
not
been
nearly
dark
they
must
have
discovered
the
force
of
the
feelings
which
then
agitated
me
i
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
though
burning
with
impatience
to
obtain
from
them
farther
particulars
it
was
some
moments
before
i
could
trust
myself
to
speak
at
length
i
asked
them
when
the
suttee
would
take
place
and
was
answered
by
one
of
them
that
it
would
certainly
be
performed
on
the
following
day
and
that
he
had
seen
the
funeral
pile
himself
without
any
farther
delay
i
set
out
immediately
for
the
city
and
reached
it
in
as
short
a
time
as
a
jaded
horse
could
carry
me
i
came
in
sight
of
benares
the
next
morning
from
a
hill
which
overlooks
it
from
the
east
the
sun
was
just
rising
and
pouring
a
flood
of
light
ever
the
city
the
river
and
the
surrounding
country
never
was
contrast
greater
than
between
my
present
feelings
and
those
which
the
same
spectacle
had
formerly
excited
i
now
sickened
at
the
prospect
which
once
would
have
set
my
heart
bounding
with
joy
i
pressed
on
in
desperate
haste
scarcely
however
knowing
what
i
did
being
at
once
overpowered
with
fatigue
loss
of
sleep
and
harassing
emotions
i
still
had
to
travel
a
circuitous
course
of
some
two
or
three
miles
and
when
i
reached
the
city
its
crowded
population
was
already
in
motion
a
great
multitude
of
women
of
the
lower
order
with
alarm
and
expectation
strongly
depicted
in
their
faces
were
to
be
seen
mingling
in
the
crowd
and
pressing
on
in
the
same
direction
i
would
have
proceeded
immediately
to
my
father
house
but
for
the
fear
of
being
too
late
alighting
therefore
from
my
horse
i
gave
him
in
charge
to
my
servant
whom
i
sent
to
inform
my
parents
of
my
arrival
and
to
request
my
father
to
meet
me
at
the
suttee
i
then
joined
the
mixed
multitude
which
now
thronged
the
streets
occupied
as
my
thoughts
were
with
the
scene
i
was
about
to
witness
and
with
fears
for
its
issue
they
were
often
interrupted
with
remarks
made
in
the
crowd
in
which
veenah
name
or
mine
were
mentioned
some
lamenting
her
cruel
fate
others
pitying
mine
but
all
condemning
and
execrating
shunah
shoo
fortunately
i
was
not
recognised
by
any
whom
i
saw
when
we
reached
the
spot
selected
for
the
sacrifice
the
crowd
that
had
there
assembled
was
not
so
great
as
to
prevent
our
getting
near
the
funeral
pile
but
the
numbers
continued
to
augment
until
nothing
could
be
seen
from
the
slight
eminence
on
which
i
stood
but
one
dense
mass
of
heads
all
looking
one
way
and
expressing
the
intense
interest
they
felt
at
length
a
murmur
like
that
of
distant
thunder
ran
through
the
crowd
a
passage
was
with
some
difficulty
effected
through
the
multitude
by
the
officers
in
attendance
and
the
wretched
veenah
made
her
appearance
supported
by
her
own
father
on
one
side
and
an
uncle
on
the
other
pale
enough
to
be
taken
for
an
european
emaciated
indeed
but
still
retaining
the
same
exquisite
beauty
of
features
and
symmetry
of
form
she
moved
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
utterly
indifferent
to
the
concerns
of
this
world
and
to
the
awful
fate
which
awaited
her
she
turned
her
head
on
hearing
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
seeing
me
shrieked
out
he
lives
he
lives
but
immediately
afterwards
fainted
in
the
arms
of
her
supporters
at
the
same
moment
i
was
forcibly
held
back
by
some
of
the
attendants
and
a
number
of
the
bystanders
rushed
in
between
us
and
intercepted
my
view
i
heard
my
name
now
repeated
in
every
direction
by
the
multitude
some
calling
out
to
the
priests
to
desist
and
others
to
proceed
i
struggled
to
extricate
myself
and
passion
lent
me
momentary
strength
but
it
was
insufficient
after
a
short
interval
i
distinctly
heard
veenah
imploring
them
to
spare
her
i
called
to
the
brahmins
who
held
her
to
leave
her
to
herself
i
endeavoured
to
rouse
the
multitude
but
they
took
the
precaution
to
drown
our
voices
by
the
musical
instruments
which
are
used
on
these
occasions
four
of
these
monsters
i
saw
profaning
the
name
of
religion
by
forcibly
placing
their
victim
on
the
pile
under
the
show
of
assisting
her
to
mount
it
and
there
held
her
down
beside
the
dead
body
of
her
husband
until
by
cords
provided
for
the
purpose
she
was
prevented
from
rising
i
besought
i
threatened
i
raved
but
all
thoughts
and
minds
were
engrossed
by
the
premature
fate
of
one
so
young
and
beautiful
and
i
was
unheeded
among
the
relatives
who
pressed
around
the
funeral
pile
i
saw
balty
mahu
and
indignation
for
a
moment
got
the
better
of
grief
the
pile
was
now
lighted
and
in
a
moment
all
was
hidden
in
smoke
i
sickened
at
the
sight
and
was
obliged
to
turn
away
even
then
i
heard
or
thought
i
heard
the
dying
shrieks
of
the
victim
amid
the
groans
and
cries
and
the
thousand
shouts
that
rent
the
air
the
pile
and
its
contents
being
now
enveloped
in
flame
my
keepers
set
me
free
when
by
an
impulse
of
frenzy
i
rushed
to
the
pile
to
make
a
last
vain
effort
to
rescue
veenah
or
to
share
her
fate
but
was
stopped
by
some
of
the
bystanders
who
called
my
act
a
profanation
said
balty
mahu
has
always
been
a
scoffer
of
our
religion
as
soon
as
these
words
reached
my
ears
with
the
quickness
of
thought
i
snatched
a
cimeter
from
the
hands
of
one
of
the
guards
and
plunged
it
in
his
breast
of
all
that
happened
afterwards
my
recollection
is
very
confused
i
was
rudely
seized
and
hurried
to
prison
my
father
was
coming
to
meet
me
when
he
was
informed
of
the
fatal
deed
i
remember
that
my
coolness
or
rather
stupor
was
in
strong
contrast
with
the
violence
of
his
emotion
he
accompanied
me
to
prison
and
continued
with
me
that
night
it
is
not
easy
to
take
the
life
of
one
of
my
caste
in
india
and
by
dint
of
the
exertions
of
my
friends
in
spite
of
the
influence
of
shunah
shoo
and
the
family
of
the
omrah
i
was
pardoned
on
condition
of
doing
penance
which
was
that
i
should
never
live
in
a
country
in
which
the
religion
of
brahmin
prevailed
and
should
not
again
look
at
or
converse
with
any
woman
for
two
minutes
together
ere
this
took
place
my
excellent
mother
unable
to
withstand
the
shocks
she
had
received
from
my
supposed
death
my
misfortunes
and
my
crime
died
a
martyr
to
maternal
affection
wishing
to
conform
to
the
sentence
and
to
be
as
near
my
father
as
i
could
i
removed
to
the
kingdom
of
ava
where
you
know
they
are
followers
of
buddha
here
i
continued
as
long
as
my
father
lived
which
was
about
six
years
in
this
period
time
had
so
alleviated
my
grief
that
i
began
to
take
pleasure
in
the
cultivation
of
science
which
constituted
my
chief
employment
after
my
father
death
i
indulged
a
curiosity
i
had
felt
in
my
youth
of
seeing
foreign
countries
and
i
visited
china
japan
and
england
during
my
residence
in
asia
i
had
discovered
lunarium
ore
in
the
mountain
near
mogaun
and
this
circumstance
many
years
afterwards
when
i
determined
to
rest
from
my
labours
induced
me
to
settle
in
that
mountain
as
i
have
before
stated
i
have
occasionally
used
the
metal
to
counterbalance
the
gravity
of
a
small
car
by
which
i
have
profited
by
a
favourable
wind
to
indulge
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
looking
down
on
the
tombs
of
my
parents
and
of
the
veenah
approaching
the
earth
near
enough
in
the
night
to
see
the
sacred
spots
but
not
enough
to
violate
the
religious
injunctions
of
my
caste
to
avoid
which
however
it
was
sometimes
necessary
for
me
to
go
across
hindostan
to
arabia
or
persia
and
there
wait
for
a
change
of
wind
before
i
could
return
and
it
was
these
excursions
which
suggested
to
the
superstitious
burmans
that
my
form
had
undergone
a
temporary
transformation
when
such
have
been
the
woes
of
my
life
you
can
no
longer
think
it
strange
atterley
that
i
delayed
their
painful
recital
or
that
after
having
endured
so
much
all
common
dangers
and
misfortunes
should
appear
to
me
insignificant
the
venerable
brahmin
here
concluded
his
narrative
and
we
both
remained
thoughtful
and
silent
for
some
time
he
apparently
absorbed
in
the
recollections
of
his
eventful
life
and
i
partly
in
the
reflections
awakened
by
his
story
and
partly
in
the
intense
interest
of
revisiting
my
native
earth
and
beholding
once
more
all
who
were
dear
to
me
already
the
extended
map
beneath
us
was
assuming
a
distinct
and
varied
appearance
and
the
brahmin
having
applied
his
eye
to
the
telescope
and
made
a
brief
calculation
of
our
progress
considered
that
hours
more
if
no
accident
interrupted
us
would
end
our
voyage
part
of
which
interval
i
passed
in
making
notes
in
my
journal
and
in
contemplating
the
different
sections
of
our
globe
as
they
presented
themselves
successively
to
the
eye
it
was
my
wish
to
land
on
the
american
continent
and
if
possible
in
the
united
states
but
the
brahmin
put
an
end
to
that
hope
by
reminding
me
that
we
should
be
attracted
towards
the
equator
and
that
we
had
to
choose
between
asia
africa
and
south
america
and
that
our
only
course
would
be
to
check
the
progress
of
our
car
over
the
country
of
greatest
extent
through
which
the
equinoctial
circle
might
pass
saying
which
he
relapsed
into
his
melancholy
silence
and
i
betook
myself
once
more
to
the
telescope
with
a
bosom
throbbing
with
emotion
i
saw
that
we
were
descending
towards
the
american
continent
when
we
were
about
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
the
earth
the
brahmin
arrested
the
progress
of
the
car
and
we
hovered
over
the
broad
atlantic
looking
down
on
the
ocean
the
first
object
which
presented
itself
to
my
eye
was
a
small
shallop
which
was
buffeting
the
waves
in
a
direction
i
presumed
it
was
a
new
england
trader
on
a
voyage
to
some
part
of
the
republic
of
colombia
and
by
way
of
diverting
my
friend
from
his
melancholy
reverie
i
told
him
some
of
the
many
stories
which
are
current
respecting
the
enterprise
and
ingenuity
of
this
portion
of
my
countrymen
and
above
all
their
adroitness
at
a
bargain
methinks
says
the
brahmin
you
are
describing
a
native
of
canton
or
pekin
but
added
he
after
a
short
pause
though
to
a
superficial
observer
man
appears
to
put
on
very
different
characters
to
a
philosopher
he
is
every
where
the
same
for
he
is
every
where
moulded
by
the
circumstances
in
which
he
is
placed
thus
let
him
be
in
a
situation
that
is
propitious
to
commerce
and
the
habits
of
traffic
produce
in
him
shrewdness
and
address
trade
is
carried
on
chiefly
in
towns
because
it
is
there
carried
on
most
advantageously
this
situation
gives
the
trader
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
his
species
a
more
ready
insight
into
character
and
of
the
modes
of
operating
on
it
his
chief
purpose
is
to
buy
as
cheap
and
to
sell
as
dear
as
he
can
and
he
is
often
able
to
heighten
the
recommendations
or
soften
the
defects
of
some
of
the
articles
in
which
he
deals
without
danger
of
immediate
detection
or
in
other
words
his
representations
have
some
influence
with
his
customers
he
avails
himself
of
this
circumstance
and
thus
acquires
the
habit
of
lying
but
as
he
is
studious
to
conceal
it
he
becomes
wary
ingenious
and
cunning
it
is
thus
that
the
phenicians
the
carthagenians
the
dutch
the
chinese
the
and
the
modern
greeks
have
always
been
regarded
as
inclined
to
petty
frauds
by
their
less
commercial
neighbours
i
mentioned
the
english
nation
if
the
english
said
he
interrupting
me
who
are
the
most
commercial
people
of
modern
times
have
not
acquired
the
same
character
it
is
because
they
are
as
distinguished
for
other
things
as
for
traffic
they
are
not
merely
a
commercial
people
they
are
also
agricultural
warlike
and
literary
and
thus
the
natural
tendencies
of
commerce
are
mutually
counteracted
we
afterwards
descended
slowly
the
prospect
beneath
us
becoming
more
beautiful
than
my
humble
pen
can
hope
to
describe
or
will
even
attempt
to
portray
in
a
short
time
after
we
were
in
sight
of
venezuela
we
met
with
the
and
were
carried
by
them
forty
or
fifty
miles
inland
where
with
some
difficulty
and
even
danger
we
landed
the
brahmin
and
myself
remained
together
two
days
and
parted
he
to
explore
the
andes
to
obtain
additional
light
on
the
subject
of
his
hypothesis
and
i
on
the
wings
of
impatience
to
visit
once
more
my
family
and
friends
but
before
our
separation
i
assisted
my
friend
in
concealing
our
aerial
vessel
and
received
a
promise
from
him
to
visit
and
perhaps
spend
with
me
the
evening
of
his
life
of
my
journey

remains

be

it
is
somewhat
remarkable
that
perhaps
the
voyages
to
the
moon
which
have
been
published
in
the
english
tongue
should
have
been
the
productions
of
english
bishops
the
first
forming
a
tract
in
the
harleian
miscellany
and
said
to
have
been
written
by
francis
goodwin
bishop
of
landaff
who
died
in
and
entitled
man
in
the
moon
or
the
discourse
of
a
voyage
by
domingo
gonsales
and
the
second
written
in
by
john
wilkins
bishop
of
chester
under
the
title
of
discovery
of
a
new
world
or
a
discourse
tending
to
prove
that
is
probable
there
may
be
another
habitable
world
in
the
moon
with
a
discourse
concerning
the
possibility
of
a
passage
thither
these
two
works
differ
in
several
essential
particulars
in
goodwin
we
have
men
of
enormous
stature
and
prodigious
longevity
with
a
flying
chariot
and
some
other
slight
points
of
resemblance
to
the
travels
of
gulliver
whilst
bishop
wilkins
is
intended
honestly
and
scientifically
to
prove
that
it
is
possible
for
some
of
our
posterity
to
find
out
a
conveyance
to
this
other
world
and
if
there
be
inhabitants
there
which
the
bishop
satisfactorily
to
himself
settles
to
have
commerce
with
them
from
the
first
of
these
swift
has
derived
many
hints
in
his
voyage
to
laputa
and
improved
them
into
those
humorous
and
instructive
allusions
which
have
caused
the
reputation
of
the
author
of
the
travels
of
gulliver
to
be
extended
to
every
portion
of
the
civilized
globe
since
the
appearance
of
this
celebrated
satire
no
one
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
lash
the
follies
of
the
age
the
agunt
has
made
its
appearance
we
have
had
numerous
ephemeral
productions
inflicting
severe
castigations
upon
particular
vices
or
absurdities
but
the
visionary
conceits
of
the
many
constantly
promulgated
in
the
progressive
advancement
of
human
knowledge
although
legitimate
objects
of
censure
have
not
since
the
time
of
swift
been
embodied
into
one
publication
the
evident
aim
of
the
author
of
the
satirical
romance
before
us
is
to
fulfil
for
the
present
age
what
so
successfully
accomplished
for
that
which
has
passed
by
to
attack
by
the
weapons
of
ridicule
those
votaries
of
knowledge
who
may
have
sought
to
avail
themselves
of
the
universal
love
of
novelty
amongst
mankind
to
acquire
celebrity
or
who
may
have
been
misled
by
their
own
imaginations
to
obtrude
upon
the
world
their
crude
and
imperfect
theories
and
systems
to
the
manifest
retardation
of
knowledge
an
effect
too
liable
to
be
induced
in
a
direct
ratio
with
the
degree
of
talent
and
ingenuity
by
which
their
views
may
have
been
supported
several
of
these
may
always
be
more
successfully
attacked
by
ridicule
than
by
reason
inasmuch
as
they
are
in
this
way
more
likely
to
become
the
subjects
of
popular
animadversion
and
many
who
could
withstand
the
serious
arguments
of
their
fraternity
can
not
placidly
endure
their
ridicule
satire
has
indeed
often
done
more
service
to
the
cause
of
religion
and
morality
than
a
sermon
since
the
remedy
is
agreeable
whilst
it
at
the
same
time
communicates
indignation
or
fear
of
all
the
ways
that
wisest
men
could
find
to
mend
the
age
and
mortify
mankind
satire
well
writ
has
most
successful
prov
and
cures
because
the
remedy
is
lov
to
produce
however
the
full
effect
satire
must
possess
a
certain
degree
of
impartiality
and
be
levelled
in
all
instances
at
the
vices
or
follies
and
not
at
the
man
the
first
sketch
of
gulliver
travels
occurs
in
the
proposed
travels
of
martinus
scriblerus
devised
in
that
pleasing
society
where
most
of
swift
miscellanies
were
planned
had
the
work
however
been
executed
under
the
same
auspices
it
would
probably
as
sir
walter
scott
has
suggested
have
been
occupied
by
that
personal
satire
upon
obscure
and
unworthy
contemporaries
to
which
pope
was
but
too
much
addicted
but
when
the
dean
mused
in
solitude
over
the
execution
of
his
plan
it
assumed
at
once
a
more
grand
and
a
darker
complexion
the
spirit
of
indignant
hatred
and
contempt
with
which
he
regarded
the
mass
of
humanity
his
quiet
and
powerful
perception
of
their
failings
errors
and
crimes
his
zeal
for
liberty
and
freedom
of
thought
tended
at
once
to
generalize
while
it
embittered
his
satire
and
to
change
traits
of
personal
severity
for
that
deep
shade
of
censure
which
gulliver
travels
throw
upon
mankind
universally
most
of
the
sentiments
which
impressed
swift
seem
also
to
have
been
felt
by
the
unknown
author
of
the
work
before
us
it
is
not
however
free
from
personal
allusions
but
they
are
all
conveyed
in
so
good
natured
a
manner
as
to
satisfy
the
reader
that
the
author
has
been
solicitous
to
animadvert
only
on
the
vices
of
the
individual
and
in
no
part
of
the
work
is
there
the
slightest
evidence
of
prejudice
or
venom
the
pseudo
the
hero
of
the
narrative
was
born
in
huntingdon
on
the
of
may
he
was
the
son
of
a
seafaring
individual
who
by
means
of
the
portion
he
received
by
his
wife
together
with
his
own
earnings
was
enabled
to
quit
that
laborious
occupation
and
to
enter
into
trade
and
after
the
death
of
his
by
whose
will
he
received
a
handsome
accession
to
his
property
he
sought
in
the
city
of
a
theatre
better
adapted
to
his
enlarged
capital
he
here
engaged
in
foreign
trade
and
partaking
of
the
prosperity
which
then
attended
american
commerce
gradually
extended
his
business
and
finally
embarked
in
the
then
new
branch
of
traffic
to
the
east
indies
and
china
he
was
now
generally
respected
both
for
his
wealth
and
fair
dealing
was
several
years
a
director
in
one
of
the
insurance
offices
was
president
of
the
society
for
relieving
the
widows
and
orphans
of
distressed
seamen
and
it
is
said
might
have
been
chosen
alderman
if
he
had
not
refused
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
think
himself
qualified
our
hero
was
at
an
early
age
put
to
a
grammar
school
of
good
repute
in
his
native
village
and
at
seventeen
was
sent
to
princeton
to
prepare
himself
for
some
profession
during
his
third
year
at
that
place
in
one
of
his
excursions
to
philadelphia
he
became
enamoured
with
one
of
those
faces
and
forms
which
in
a
youth
of
twenty
to
see
admire
and
love
is
one
and
the
same
thing
and
was
united
to
the
object
of
his
affections
on
the
anniversary
of
his
year
this
event
gave
him
a
distaste
for
serious
study
and
long
before
this
he
had
felt
a
sentiment
bordering
on
contempt
for
mercantile
pursuits
he
therefore
prevailed
upon
his
father
to
purchase
him
a
neat
country
seat
in
the
vicinity
of
huntingdon
here
seventeen
happy
years
glided
away
swiftly
and
imperceptibly
when
death
by
depriving
him
of
the
partner
of
his
felicity
prostrated
all
his
hopes
and
enjoyments
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
for
that
relief
to
the
feelings
which
variety
can
best
afford
he
now
determined
to
make
a
voyage
and
as
one
of
his
father
vessels
was
about
to
sail
for
canton
embarked
on
board
of
her
and
left
sandyhook
on
the
day
of
june
from
this
period
until
the
of
october
their
voyage
was
comparatively
agreeable
but
when
off
the
mouths
of
the
ganges
one
of
those
hurricanes
well
known
to
the
experienced
navigators
of
the
eastern
seas
struck
the
ship
and
rendered
her
so
leaky
that
the
captain
considered
it
advisable
to
make
for
the
nearest
port
the
leak
however
increasing
rapidly
and
finding
themselves
off
a
coast
which
the
captain
by
his
charts
pronounced
to
be
a
part
of
the
burman
empire
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mergui
on
the
martaban
coast
they
hastily
threw
their
clothes
papers
and
eight
casks
of
silver
into
the
and
before
they
were
fifty
yards
from
the
ship
had
the
melancholy
satisfaction
to
see
her
go
down
it
was
a
little
after
when
we
reached
the
town
which
is
perched
on
a
high
bluff
overlooking
the
coasts
and
contains
about
a
thousand
houses
built
of
bamboo
and
covered
with
palm
leaves
our
dress
appearance
language
and
the
manner
of
our
arrival
excited
great
surprise
among
the
natives
and
the
liveliest
curiosity
but
with
these
sentiments
some
evidently
mingled
no
very
friendly
feelings
the
burmese
were
then
on
the
eve
of
a
rupture
with
the
east
india
company
a
fact
which
we
had
not
before
known
and
mistaking
us
for
english
they
supposed
or
affected
to
suppose
that
we
belonged
to
a
fleet
which
was
about
to
invade
them
and
that
our
ship
had
been
sunk
before
their
eyes
by
the
tutelar
divinity
of
the
country
we
were
immediately
carried
before
their
governor
or
chief
magistrate
who
ordered
our
baggage
to
be
searched
and
finding
that
it
consisted
principally
of
silver
he
had
no
doubt
of
our
hostile
intentions
he
therefore
sent
all
of
us
in
number
to
prison
separating
however
each
one
from
the
rest
my
companions
were
released
the
following
spring
as
i
have
since
learnt
by
the
invading
army
of
great
britain
but
it
was
my
ill
fortune
if
indeed
after
what
has
since
happened
i
can
so
regard
it
to
be
taken
for
an
officer
of
high
rank
and
to
be
sent
the
third
day
afterwards
far
into
the
interior
that
i
might
be
more
safely
kept
and
either
used
as
a
hostage
or
offered
for
ransom
as
circumstances
should
render
advantageous
our
hero
was
transported
very
rapidly
in
a
palanquin
for
thirteen
successive
days
when
he
reached
mozaun
a
small
village
delightfully
situated
in
the
mountainous
district
between
the
irawaddi
and
saloon
rivers
where
he
was
placed
under
the
care
of
an
inferior
magistrate
who
there
exercised
the
chief
authority
by
submissive
and
respectful
behaviour
he
succeeded
in
ingratiating
himself
so
completely
with
his
keeper
that
he
was
regarded
more
as
one
of
his
family
than
as
a
prisoner
and
was
allowed
every
indulgence
consistently
with
his
safe
custody
it
had
been
one
of
his
favourite
recreations
to
ascend
a
part
of
the
western
ridge
of
mountains
which
rose
in
a
cone
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
village
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
the
enchanting
scenery
that
lay
before
him
and
the
evening
breeze
which
possesses
so
delicious
a
degree
of
freshness
in
tropical
climates
here
he
became
acquainted
with
a
personage
of
whom
as
he
exerted
an
important
influence
over
the
future
conduct
of
our
hero
it
is
of
consequence
that
the
reader
should
acquire
early
information
in
a
deep
sequestered
nook
formed
by
two
spurs
of
this
mountain
there
lived
a
venerable
hindoo
whom
the
people
of
the
village
called
the
holy
hermit
the
favourable
accounts
i
received
of
his
character
as
well
as
his
odd
course
of
life
made
me
very
desirous
of
becoming
acquainted
with
him
and
as
he
was
often
visited
by
the
villagers
i
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
conductor
to
his
cell
his
character
for
sanctity
together
with
a
venerable
beard
might
have
discouraged
advances
towards
an
acquaintance
if
his
lively
piercing
eye
a
countenance
expressive
of
great
mildness
and
kindness
of
disposition
and
his
courteous
manners
had
not
yet
more
strongly
invited
it
he
was
indeed
not
averse
to
society
though
he
had
seemed
thus
to
fly
from
it
and
was
so
great
a
favourite
with
his
neighbours
that
his
cell
would
have
been
thronged
with
visiters
but
for
the
difficulty
of
the
approach
to
it
as
it
was
it
was
seldom
resorted
to
except
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
his
opinion
and
counsel
on
all
the
serious
concerns
of
his
neighbours
he
prescribed
for
the
sick
and
often
provided
the
medicine
they
required
expounded
the
law
adjusted
disputes
made
all
their
little
arithmetical
calculations
gave
them
moral
instruction
and
when
he
could
not
afford
them
relief
in
their
difficulties
he
taught
them
patience
and
gave
them
consolation
he
in
short
united
for
the
simple
people
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
the
functions
of
lawyer
physician
schoolmaster
and
divine
and
richly
merited
the
reverential
respect
in
which
they
held
him
as
well
as
their
little
presents
of
eggs
fruit
and
garden
stuff
from
the
first
evening
that
i
joined
the
party
which
i
saw
clambering
up
the
path
that
led
to
the
hermit
cell
i
found
myself
strongly
attached
to
this
venerable
man
and
the
more
so
from
the
mystery
which
hung
around
his
history
it
was
agreed
that
he
was
not
a
burmese
none
deemed
to
know
certainly
where
he
was
born
or
why
he
came
thither
his
own
account
was
that
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
service
of
god
and
in
his
pilgrimage
over
the
east
had
selected
this
as
a
spot
particularly
favourable
to
the
life
of
quiet
and
seclusion
he
wished
to
lead
there
was
one
part
of
his
story
to
which
i
could
scarcely
give
credit
it
was
said
that
in
the
twelve
or
fifteen
years
he
had
resided
in
this
place
he
had
been
occasionally
invisible
for
months
together
and
no
one
could
tell
why
he
disappeared
or
whither
he
had
gone
at
these
times
his
cell
was
closed
and
although
none
ventured
to
force
their
way
into
it
those
who
were
the
most
prying
could
hear
no
sound
indicating
that
he
was
within
various
were
the
conjectures
formed
on
the
subject
some
supposed
that
he
withdrew
from
the
sight
of
men
for
the
purpose
of
more
fervent
prayer
and
more
holy
meditation
others
that
he
visited
his
home
or
some
other
distant
country
the
more
superstitious
believed
that
he
had
by
a
kind
of
metempsychosis
taken
a
new
shape
which
by
some
magical
or
supernatural
power
he
could
assume
and
put
off
at
pleasure
this
opinion
was
perhaps
the
most
prevalent
as
it
gained
a
colour
with
these
simple
people
from
the
chemical
and
astronomical
instruments
he
possessed
in
these
he
evidently
took
great
pleasure
and
by
then
means
he
acquired
some
of
the
knowledge
by
which
he
so
often
excited
their
admiration
he
soon
distinguished
me
from
the
rest
of
his
visiters
by
addressing
questions
to
me
relative
to
my
history
and
adventures
and
i
in
turn
was
gratified
to
have
met
with
one
who
took
an
interest
in
my
concerns
and
who
alone
of
all
i
had
here
met
with
could
either
enter
into
my
feelings
or
comprehend
my
opinions
our
conversations
were
earned
on
in
english
which
he
spoke
with
facility
and
correctness
we
soon
found
ourselves
so
much
to
each
other
taste
that
there
was
seldom
an
evening
that
i
did
not
make
him
a
visit
and
pass
an
hour
or
two
in
his
company
i
learned
from
him
that
he
was
born
and
bred
at
benares
in
hindostan
that
he
had
been
intended
for
the
priesthood
and
had
been
well
instructed
in
the
literature
of
the
east
that
a
course
of
untoward
circumstances
upon
which
he
seemed
unwilling
to
dwell
had
changed
his
destination
and
made
him
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
in
the
neighbouring
kingdom
of
siam
he
had
formed
an
intimacy
with
a
learned
french
jesuit
who
had
not
only
taught
him
his
language
but
imparted
to
him
a
knowledge
of
much
of
the
science
of
europe
its
institutions
and
manners
that
after
the
death
of
this
friend
he
had
renewed
his
wanderings
and
having
been
detained
in
this
village
by
a
fit
of
sickness
for
some
weeks
he
was
warned
that
it
was
time
to
quit
his
rambling
life
this
place
being
recommended
to
him
both
by
its
quiet
seclusion
and
the
unsophisticated
manners
of
its
inhabitants
he
determined
to
pass
the
remnant
of
his
days
here
and
by
devoting
them
to
the
purposes
of
piety
charity
and
science
to
discharge
his
duty
to
his
creator
his
species
and
himself
the
love
of
knowledge
he
added
long
been
my
chief
source
of
selfish
enjoyment
the
acquaintance
between
atterley
and
the
brahmin
ripened
by
degrees
into
that
close
friendship
which
a
congeniality
of
tastes
and
sentiments
under
proper
opportunities
never
fails
to
engender
atterley
visits
to
the
hermitage
became
more
and
more
frequent
for
upwards
of
three
years
during
which
period
the
brahmin
had
occasionally
thrown
out
obscure
hints
that
the
time
would
come
when
our
hero
should
be
restored
to
liberty
and
that
he
had
an
important
secret
which
he
would
one
day
communicate
about
this
period
one
afternoon
in
the
month
of
march
when
atterley
repaired
as
usual
to
the
hermitage
he
found
the
brahmin
dangerously
ill
of
a
pleuritic
affection
and
apprehensive
that
the
attack
might
prove
fatal
sit
down
said
he
on
that
block
and
listen
to
what
i
shall
say
to
you
though
i
shall
quit
this
state
of
being
for
another
and
a
better
i
confess
that
i
was
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
expiring
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
you
i
am
the
depository
of
a
secret
that
i
believe
is
known
to
no
other
living
mortal
i
once
determined
that
it
should
die
with
me
and
had
i
not
met
with
you
it
certainly
should
but
from
our
first
acquaintance
my
heart
has
been
strongly
attracted
towards
you
and
as
soon
as
i
found
you
possessed
of
qualities
to
inspire
esteem
as
well
as
regard
i
felt
disposed
to
give
you
this
proof
of
my
confidence
still
i
hesitated
i
first
wished
to
deliberate
on
the
probable
effects
of
my
disclosure
upon
the
condition
of
society
i
saw
that
it
might
produce
evil
as
well
as
good
but
on
weighing
the
two
together
i
have
satisfied
myself
that
the
good
will
preponderate
and
have
determined
to
act
accordingly
take
this
key
stretching
out
his
feverish
hand
and
after
waiting
two
hours
in
which
time
the
medicine
i
have
taken
will
have
either
produced
a
good
effect
or
put
an
end
to
my
sufferings
you
may
then
open
that
blue
chest
in
the
corner
it
has
a
false
bottom
on
removing
the
paper
which
covers
it
you
will
find
the
manuscript
containing
the
important
secret
together
with
some
gold
pieces
which
i
have
saved
for
the
day
of
need
because
and
he
smiled
in
spite
of
his
sufferings
because
hoarding
is
one
of
the
pleasures
of
old
men
take
them
both
and
use
them
discreetly
atterley
quitted
the
cell
and
waited
with
feverish
expectation
for
the
termination
of
the
allotted
two
hours
when
to
his
inexpressible
delight
he
found
on
the
cell
that
not
only
did
the
brahmin
breathe
but
that
he
slept
soundly
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
he
awoke
almost
restored
to
health
this
event
however
was
the
occasion
of
a
more
early
disclosure
of
the
brahmin
important
secret
but
not
until
he
had
recovered
his
ordinary
health
and
vigour
i
have
already
told
you
my
dear
atterley
that
i
was
born
and
educated
at
benares
and
that
science
is
there
more
thoroughly
understood
and
taught
than
the
people
of
the
west
are
aware
of
we
have
for
many
thousands
of
years
been
good
astronomers
chymists
mathematicians
and
philosophers
we
had
discovered
the
secret
of
gunpowder
the
magnetic
attraction
the
properties
of
electricity
long
before
they
were
heard
of
in
europe
we
know
more
than
we
have
revealed
and
much
of
our
knowledge
is
deposited
in
the
archives
of
the
castle
to
which
i
belong
but
for
want
of
language
generally
understood
and
easily
learnt
for
these
records
are
always
written
in
the
sanscrit
that
is
no
longer
a
spoken
language
and
the
diffusion
which
is
given
by
the
art
of
printing
these
secrets
of
science
are
communicated
only
to
a
few
and
sometimes
even
sleep
with
their
authors
until
a
subsequent
discovery
under
more
favourable
circumstances
brings
them
again
to
light
it
was
at
this
seat
of
science
that
i
learned
from
one
of
our
sages
the
physical
truth
which
i
am
now
about
to
communicate
and
which
he
discovered
partly
by
his
researches
into
the
writings
of
ancient
pundits
and
partly
by
his
own
extraordinary
sagacity
there
is
a
principle
of
repulsion
as
well
as
gravitation
in
the
earth
it
causes
fire
to
rise
upwards
it
is
exhibited
in
electricity
it
occasions
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
after
much
labour
and
research
this
principle
has
been
found
embodied
in
a
metallic
substance
which
is
met
with
in
the
mountain
in
which
we
are
united
with
a
very
heavy
earth
and
this
circumstance
had
great
influence
in
inducing
me
to
settle
myself
here
this
metal
when
separated
and
purified
has
as
great
a
tendency
to
fly
off
from
the
earth
as
a
piece
of
gold
or
lead
has
to
approach
it
after
making
a
number
of
curious
experiments
with
it
we
bethought
ourselves
of
putting
it
to
some
use
and
soon
contrived
with
the
aid
of
it
to
make
cars
and
ascend
into
the
air
we
were
very
secret
in
these
operations
for
our
unhappy
country
having
then
recently
fallen
under
the
subjection
of
the
british
nation
we
apprehended
that
if
we
divulged
our
arcanum
they
would
not
only
fly
away
with
all
our
treasures
whether
found
in
palace
or
pagoda
but
also
carry
off
the
inhabitants
to
make
them
slaves
in
their
colonies
as
their
government
had
not
then
abolished
the
african
slave
trade
after
various
trials
and
many
successive
improvements
in
which
our
desires
increased
with
our
success
we
determined
to
penetrate
the
aerial
void
as
far
as
we
could
providing
for
that
purpose
an
apparatus
with
which
you
will
become
better
acquainted
hereafter
in
the
course
of
our
experiments
we
discovered
that
this
same
metal
which
was
repelled
from
the
earth
was
in
the
same
degree
attracted
towards
the
moon
for
in
one
of
our
excursions
still
aiming
to
ascend
higher
than
we
had
ever
done
before
we
were
actually
carried
to
that
satellite
and
if
we
had
not
there
fallen
into
a
lake
and
our
machine
had
not
been
we
must
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
or
drowned
you
will
find
in
this
book
he
added
presenting
me
with
a
small
volume
bound
in
green
parchment
and
fastened
with
silver
clasps
a
minute
detail
of
the
apparatus
to
be
provided
and
the
directions
to
be
pursued
in
making
this
wonderful
voyage
i
have
written
it
since
i
satisfied
my
mind
that
my
fears
of
british
rapacity
were
unfounded
and
that
i
should
do
more
good
than
harm
by
publishing
the
secret
but
still
i
am
not
sure
he
added
with
one
of
his
faint
but
significant
smiles
that
i
am
not
actuated
by
a
wish
to
immortalize
my
name
for
where
is
the
mortal
who
would
be
indifferent
to
this
object
if
he
thought
he
could
attain
it
read
the
book
at
your
leisure
and
study
it
here
by
the
way
we
may
remark
that
the
kind
of
vehicle
best
adapted
for
conveyance
through
the
aerial
void
has
been
a
weighty
stumbling
block
to
authors
from
the
time
of
the
ganymede
to
that
of
daniel
or
of
the
wing
furnished

that
of

but
receiving
a
severe
contusion
on
the
head
from

he
ingeniously
had
recourse
to
a
scheme
of
flying
through
the
air
on
a
colossal
variety
of
those
industrious
but
not

of

evidently
intended
by
their

as

boldly

that
it
is
possible
to
make
a
flying
chariot
in
which
a
man
may
sit
and
give
such
a
motion
unto
it
as
shall
convey
him
through
the
air
and
this
perhaps
might
be
made
large
enough
to
carry
divers
men
at
the
same
time
together
with
food
for
their
and
commodities
for
traffic
it
is
not
lucidly
continues
the
bishop
the
bigness
of
any
thing
in
this
kind
that
can
hinder
its
motion
if
the
motive
faculty
be
answerable
thereunto
we
see
a
great
ship
swims
as
well
as
a
small
cork
and
an
eagle
flies
in
the
air
as
well
as
a
little
gnat
this
engine
may
be
contrived
from
the
same
principles
by
which
archytas
made
a
wooden
dove
and
regiomontanus
a
wooden
eagle
i
conceive
it
were
no
difficult
matter
if
a
man
had
leisure
to
show
more
particularly
the
means
of
composing
it
which
want
of
leisure
in
the
credulous
bishop
our
readers
will
regret
with
us
especially
those
inventive
geniuses
who
like
the
projector
in
the
reign
of
george
published
a
scheme
for
manufacturing
pine
plank
from
pine
or
the
still
more
ingenious
undertaker
of
later
times
who
proposed
to
make
out
of
by
the
mere
addition
of
a
little
turpentine
again
swift
flying
island
of
laputa
is
a
phenomenon
so
opposed
to
all
scientific
probability
and
so
directly
at
variance
with
natural
laws
that
it
loses
in
interest
in
a
direct
ratio
with
the
violence
it
does
to
our
feelings
nor
is
the
mode
of
conveyance
imagined
by
voltaire
less
incongruous
than
that
of
swift

micromegas

of

whose
adventures
were
evidently
suggested
by
those

by

latter

they
are

upon
the
ring
of
saturn
which
they
find
tolerably
flat
comme

thence
they
go
from
moon
to
moon
and
a
comet
passing
close
to
one
of
these
they
throw
themselves
upon
it
with
their
attendants
and
instruments
in
their
course
they

the
vehicle
however
has
not
formed
the
sole
obstacle
to
those
projectors
the
especially
the
food
has
been
a
difficulty
not
readily
got
over
before
bishop
wilkins
alludes
to
his
flying
chariot
he
remarks
that
even
if
men
could
fly
the
swiftest
of
them
would
probably
be
half
a
year
in
reaching
the
end
of
his
journey
and
hence
a
problem
would
arise
how
it
were
possible
to
tarry
so
long
without
sleep
or
diet
of
the
former
obstacle
however
he
quickly
disposes
seeing
we
do
not
then
spend
ourselves
in
any
labour
we
shall
not
it
may
be
the
refreshment
of
sleep
but
if
we
do
we
can
not
desire
a
softer
bed
than
the
air
where
we
may
repose
ourselves
firmly
and
safely
as
in
our
chambers
of
the
latter
he
finds
somewhat
more
difficulty
in
disposing
and
here
it
is
considerable
that
since
our
bodies
will
then
be
devoid
of
gravity
and
other
impediments
of
motion
we
shall
not
at
all
spend
ourselves
in
any
labour
and
so
consequently
not
much
need
the
reparation
of
diet
but
may
perhaps
live
altogether
without
it
as
those
creatures
have
done
who
by
reason
of
their
sleeping
for
many
days
together
have
not
spent
any
spirits
and
so
not
wanted
any
food
which
is
commonly
related
of
serpents
crocodiles
bears
cuckoos
swallows
and
such
like
to
this
purpose
mendoca
reckons
up
divers
strange
relations
as
that
of
epimenides
who
is
storied
to
have
slept
years
and
another
of
a
rustic
in
germany
who
being
accidentally
covered
with
a
slept
there
for
all
the
autumn
and
the
winter
following
without
any
nourishment
or
if
we
must
needs
feed
upon
something
else
why
may
not
smells
nourish
us
plutarch
and
pliny
and
divers
other
ancients
tell
us
of
a
nation
in
india
that
lived
only
upon
pleasing
odours
and
it
is
the
common
opinion
of
physicians
that
these
do
strangely
both
strengthen
and
repair
the
spirits
hence
was
it
that
democritus
was
able
for
divers
days
together
to
feed
himself
with
the
mere
smell
of
hot
bread
or
if
it
be
necessary
that
our
stomachs
must
receive
the
food
why
then
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
purity
of
the
etherial
air
being
not
mixed
with
any
improper
vapours
may
be
so
agreeable
to
our
bodies
as
to
yield
us
sufficient
nourishment
with
many
other
arguments
of
the
like
nature
the
bishop
ultimately
however
severs
the
knot
by
the
suggestion
of
his
flying
chariot
which
he
makes
large
enough
for
que
le
premier
pas
qui
coute
to
carry
not
only
food
for
the
of
the
passengers
but
also
commodities
for
their
traffic
infinitely
more
ingenuity
did
the
great
comic
poet
of
antiquity
display
when
he
selected
the

the
food
which
had
already
served
the
purposes

now
all
these
schemes
ingenious
as
they
may
be
are
objectionable
for
the
same
reasons
as
the
flying
island
of
laputa
their
glaring
violation
of
verisimilitude
and
many
of
them
of
possibility
in
these
respects
that
of
the
author
of
the
work
before
us
is
liable
to
less
objection
he
only
resorts
to
an
extension
of
avowed
physical
principles
and
if
we
could
suppose
a
substance
which
instead
of
gravitating
towards
the
earth
is
repelled
from
it
and
attracted
towards
the
moon
certainly
a
difficult
the
remainder
of
the
machinery
for
reaching
that
luminary
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
probability
or
the
known
laws
of
physics
but
to
return
to
the
narrative
the
brahmin
having
given
atterley
a
description
of
some
of
the
remarkable
objects
which
he
met
with
in
his
voyage
to
the
moon
expressed
his
anxiety
to
repeat
it
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
some
facts
about
which
he
had
been
speculating
as
well
as
of
removing
the
incredulity
with
which
he
could
not
but
perceive
his
story
had
impressed
his
hearer
notwithstanding
his
belief
in
the
hermit
integrity
when
atterley
eagerly
caught
at
the
proposal
their
preparations
however
required
time
as
well
as
considerable
skill
not
only
for
the
construction
of
the
vehicle
but
also
to
avoid
suspicion
and
interruption
from
the
governor
of
mergui
and
the
priesthood
who
possessed
the
usual
oriental
superstition
and
intolerance
for
the
construction
of
their
apparatus
they
had
recourse
to
an
ingenious
artificer
in
copper
and
other
metals
whose
child
the
brahmin
had
been
instrumental
in
curing
of
a
chronic
disease
and
in
whose
fidelity
as
well
as
good
will
they
could
securely
rely
the
coppersmith
agreed
to
undertake
the
work
we
wanted
done
for
a
moderate
compensation
but
we
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
inform
him
of
our
object
which
he
supposed
was
to
make
some
philosophical
experiment
it
was
forthwith
arranged
that
he
should
occasionally
visit
the
hermit
to
receive
instructions
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
asking
medical
advice
during
this
interval
my
mind
was
absorbed
with
our
project
and
when
in
company
i
was
so
thoughtful
and
abstracted
that
it
has
since
seemed
strange
to
me
that
sing
fou
suspicions
that
i
was
planning
my
escape
were
not
more
excited
at
length
by
dint
of
great
exertion
in
about
three
months
every
thing
was
in
readiness
and
we
determined
on
the
following
night
to
set
out
on
our
perilous
expedition
the
machine
in
which
we
proposed
to
embark
was
a
copper
vessel
that
would
have
been
an
exact
cube
of
six
feet
if
the
corners
and
edges
had
not
been
rounded
off
it
had
an
opening
large
enough
to
receive
our
bodies
which
was
closed
by
double
sliding
pannels
with
quilted
cloth
between
them
when
these
were
properly
adjusted
the
machine
was
perfectly
and
strong
enough
by
means
of
iron
bars
running
alternately
inside
and
out
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
when
the
machine
should
be
exhausted
of
its
air
as
we
took
the
precaution
to
prove
by
the
aid
of
an
air
pump
on
the
top
of
the
copper
chest
and
on
the
outside
we
had
as
much
of
the
lunar
metal
which
i
shall
henceforth
call
as
we
found
by
calculation
and
experiment
would
overcome
the
weight
of
the
machine
as
well
as
its
contents
and
take
us
to
the
moon
on
the
third
day
as
the
air
which
the
machine
contained
would
not
be
sufficient
for
our
respiration
more
than
about
six
hours
and
the
chief
part
of
the
space
we
were
to
pass
through
was
a
mere
void
we
provided
ourselves
with
a
sufficient
supply
by
condensing
it
in
a
small
globular
vessel
made
partly
of
iron
and
partly
of
lunarium
to
take
off
its
weight
on
my
return
i
gave
jacob
perkins
who
is
now
in
england
a
hint
of
this
plan
of
condensation
and
it
has
there
obtained
him
great
celebrity
this
fact
i
should
not
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
mention
had
he
not
taken
the
sole
merit
of
the
invention
to
himself
at
least
i
can
not
hear
that
in
his
numerous
public
notices
he
has
ever
mentioned
my
name
but
to
return
a
small
circular
window
made
of
a
single
piece
of
thick
clear
glass
was
neatly
fitted
on
each
of
the
six
sides
several
pieces
of
lead
were
securely
fastened
to
screws
which
passed
through
the
bottom
of
the
machine
as
well
as
a
thick
plank
the
screws
were
so
contrived
that
by
turning
them
in
one
direction
the
pieces
of
lead
attached
to
them
were
immediately
disengaged
from
the
hooks
with
which
they
were
connected
the
pieces
of
lunarium
were
fastened
in
like
manner
to
screws
which
passed
through
the
top
of
the
machine
so
that
by
turning
them
in
one
direction
those
metallic
pieces
would
fly
into
the
air
with
the
velocity
of
a
rocket
the
brahmin
took
with
him
a
thermometer
two
telescopes
one
of
which
projected
through
the
top
of
the
machine
and
the
other
through
the
bottom
a
phosphoric
lamp
pen
ink
and
paper
and
some
light
refreshments
sufficient
to
supply
us
for
some
days
the
moon
was
then
in
her
third
quarter
and
near
the
zenith
it
was
of
course
a
little
after
midnight
and
when
the
coppersmith
and
his
family
were
in
their
soundest
sleep
that
we
entered
the
machine
in
about
an
hour
more
we
had
the
doors
secured
and
every
thing
arranged
in
its
place
when
cutting
the
cords
which
fastened
us
to
the
ground
by
means
of
small
steel
blades
which
worked
in
the
ends
of
other
screws
we
rose
from
the
earth
with
a
whizzing
sound
and
a
sensation
at
first
of
very
rapid
ascent
but
after
a
short
time
we
were
scarcely
sensible
of
any
motion
in
the
machine
except
when
we
changed
our
places
after
the
apprehensions
of
atterley
occasioned
by
the
novelty
and
danger
of
his
situation
had
partly
subsided
he
was
enabled
with
mingled
awe
and
admiration
to
contemplate
the
magnificent
spectacle
beneath
him
as
the
earth
turned
round
its
axis
during
their
ascent
every
part
of
its
surface
came
successively
under
view
at
nine
the
whole
of
india
was
to
the
west
of
them
its
rivers
resembling
small
filaments
of
silver
and
the
red
sea
a
narrow
plate
of
the
same
metal
the
peninsula
of
india
was
of
a
dark
and
arabia
of
a
light
grayer
green
and
the
sun
rays
striking
on
the
atlantic
emitted
an
effulgence
dazzling
to
the
eyes
on
looking
some
time
afterwards
through
the
telescope
they
observed
the
african
continent
at
its
northern
edge
fringed
as
it
were
with
green
then
a
dull
white
belt
marked
the
great
sahara
or
desert
and
then
it
exhibited
a
deep
green
to
its
most
southern
extremity
the
morea
and
grecian
archipelago
now
fell
under
their
telescope
and
gradually
the
whole
mediterranean
and
arabian
gulf
the
great
media
separating
africa
from
europe
and
asia
the
political
divisions
of
these
quarters
of
the
world
were
of
course
undistinguishable
and
few
of
the
natural
were
discernible
by
the
naked
eye
the
alps
were
marked
by
a
white
streak
though
less
bright
than
the
water
by
the
aid
of
the
glass
they
could
just
discern
the
danube
the
nile
and
a
river
which
empties
itself
into
the
gulf
of
guinea
and
which
atterley
took
to
be
the
niger
but
the
other
streams
were
not
perceptible
the
most
conspicuous
object
of
the
solid
part
of
the
globe
was
the
great
desert
the
whole
of
africa
however
appeared
of
a
brighter
hue
than
either
asia
or
europe
i
was
struck
too
with
the
vast
disproportion
which
the
extent
of
the
several
countries
of
the
earth
bore
to
the
part
they
had
acted
in
history
and
the
influence
they
had
exerted
on
human
affairs
the
british
islands
had
diminished
to
a
speck
and
france
was
little
larger
yet
a
few
years
ago
it
seemed
at
least
to
us
in
the
united
states
as
if
there
were
no
other
nations
on
the
earth
the
brahmin
who
was
well
read
in
european
history
on
my
making
a
remark
on
this
subject
reminded
me
that
athens
and
sparta
had
once
obtained
almost
equal
celebrity
although
they
were
so
small
as
not
now
to
be
visible
as
i
slowly
passed
the
telescope
over
the
face
of
europe
i
pictured
to
myself
the
fat
plodding
hollander
the
patient
contemplative
german
the
ingenious
sensual
italian
the
temperate
swiss
the
haughty
superstitious
spaniard
the
sprightly
frenchman
the
sullen
and
reflecting
englishman
who
monopolise
nearly
all
the
science
and
literature
of
the
earth
to
which
they
bear
so
small
a
proportion
as
the
atlantic
fell
under
our
view
two
faint
circles
on
each
side
of
the
equator
were
to
be
perceived
by
the
naked
eye
they
were
less
bright
than
the
rest
of
the
ocean
the
brahmin
suggested
that
they
might
be
currents
which
brought
to
my
memory
franklin
conjecture
on
the
subject
now
completely
verified
by
this
circular
line
of
vapour
as
it
had
been
previously
rendered
probable
by
the
floating
substances
which
had
been
occasionally
picked
up
at
great
distances
from
the
places
where
they
had
been
thrown
into
the
ocean
the
circle
was
whiter
and
more
distinct
where
the
gulf
stream
runs
parallel
to
the
american
coast
and
gradually
grew
fainter
as
it
passed
along
the
banks
of
newfoundland
to
the
coast
of
europe
where
taking
a
southerly
direction
the
line
of
the
circle
was
barely
discernible
a
similar
circle
of
vapour
though
less
defined
and
complete
was
perceived
in
the
south
atlantic
ocean
by
degrees
the
travellers
saw
one
half
of
the
broad
expanse
of
the
pacific
which
glistened
like
quicksilver
or
polished
steel
and
subsequently
the
middle
of
the
pacific
lay
immediately
beneath
them
the
irregular
distribution
of
land
and
water
on
the
globe
the
expanse
of
ocean
here
being
twice
as
large
as
in
any
other
part
gives
occasion
to
some
amusing
discussions
on
the
various
theories
of
cosmogony
to
which
we
can
only
refer
the
reader
wearied
however
by
these
and
other
discussions
atterley
slept
for
six
hours
and
on
awaking
found
the
brahmin
busy
in
calculating
their
progress
after
which
the
latter
lay
down
and
soon
fell
into
a
tranquil
sleep
having
previously
requested
that
he
might
be
awakened
at
the
expiration
of
three
hours
or
sooner
if
any
thing
of
moment
should
occur
atterley
now
looked
down
again
through
the
telescope
and
found
the
earth
surprisingly
diminished
in
its
apparent
dimensions
from
the
increased
rapidity
of
their
ascent
the
eastern
coasts
of
asia
were
still
full
in
view
as
well
as
the
whole
figure
of
that
extensive
continent
of
of
ceylon
and
of
borneo
but
the
smaller
islands
were
invisible
i
strained
my
eye
to
no
purpose
to
follow
the
indentations
of
the
coast
according
to
the
map
before
me
the
great
bays
and
promontories
could
alone
be
perceived
the
burman
empire
in
one
of
the
insignificant
villages
of
which
i
had
been
confined
for
a
few
years
was
now
reduced
to
a
speck
the
agreeable
hours
i
had
passed
with
the
brahmin
with
the
little
daughter
of
sing
fou
and
my
rambling
over
the
neighbouring
heights
all
recurred
to
my
mind
and
i
almost
regretted
the
pleasures
i
had
relinquished
i
tried
with
more
success
to
beguile
the
time
by
making
notes
in
my
journal
and
after
having
devoted
about
an
hour
to
this
object
i
returned
to
the
telescope
and
now
took
occasion
to
examine
the
figure
of
the
earth
near
the
poles
with
a
view
of
discovering
whether
its
form
favoured
captain
theory
of
an
aperture
existing
there
and
i
am
convinced
that
that
ingenious
gentleman
is
mistaken
time
passed
so
heavily
during
these
solitary
occupations
that
i
looked
at
my
watch
every
five
minutes
and
could
scarcely
be
persuaded
it
was
not
out
of
order
i
then
took
up
my
little
bible
which
had
always
been
my
travelling
companion
read
a
few
chapters
in
matthew
and
found
my
feelings
tranquillized
and
my
courage
increased
the
desired
hour
at
length
arrived
when
on
waking
the
old
man
he
alertly
raised
himself
up
and
at
the
first
view
of
the
diminished
appearance
of
the
earth
observed
that
our
journey
was
a
third
over
as
to
time
but
not
as
to
distance
after
having
again
composed
himself
to
rest
for
about
four
hours
atterley
was
awakened
by
the
brahmin
in
whose
arms
he
found
himself
and
on
looking
around
discovered
that
he
was
lying
on
what
had
been
the
ceiling
of
the
chamber
which
still
however
felt
like
the
bottom
the
reason
of
this
phenomenon
was
thus
explained
to
him
by
the
brahmin
we
have
while
you
were
asleep
passed
the
middle
point
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
attraction
and
we
now
gravitate
less
towards
our
own
planet
than
to
her
satellite
i
took
the
precaution
to
move
you
before
you
fell
by
your
own
gravity
from
what
was
lately
the
bottom
to
that
which
is
now
so
and
to
keep
you
in
this
place
until
you
were
retained
in
it
by
the
moon
attraction
for
though
your
fall
would
have
been
at
this
point
like
that
of
a
feather
yet
it
would
have
given
you
some
shock
and
alarm
the
machine
therefore
has
undergone
no
change
in
its
position
or
course
the
change
is
altogether
in
our
feelings
the
whole
face
of
the
moon
atterley
now
found
to
be
entirely
changed
and
on
looking
through
the
upper
telescope
the
earth
presented
an
appearance
not
very
dissimilar
but
the
outline
of
her
continents
and
oceans
was
still
perceptible
in
different
shades
and
capable
of
being
readily
recognised
the
bright
glare
of
the
sun
however
made
the
surfaces
of
both
bodies
somewhat
dim
and
pale
after
a
short
interval
i
again
looked
at
the
moon
and
found
not
only
its
magnitude
very
greatly
increased
but
that
it
was
beginning
to
present
a
more
beautiful
spectacle
the
sun
rays
fell
obliquely
on
her
disc
so
that
by
a
large
part
of
its
surface
not
reflecting
the
light
i
saw
every
object
on
it
so
far
as
i
was
enabled
by
the
power
of
my
telescope
its
mountains
lakes
seas
continents
and
islands
were
faintly
though
not
indistinctly
traced
and
every
moment
brought
forth
something
new
to
catch
my
eye
and
awaken
my
curiosity
the
whole
face
of
the
moon
was
of
a
silvery
hue
relieved
and
varied
by
the
softest
and
most
delicate
shades
no
cloud
nor
speck
of
vapour
intercepted
my
view
one
of
my
exclamations
of
delight
awakened
the
brahmin
who
quickly
arose
and
looking
down
on
the
resplendent
orb
below
us
observed
that
we
must
soon
begin
to
slacken
the
rapidity
of
our
course
by
throwing
out
ballast
the
moon
dimensions
now
rapidly
increased
the
separate
mountains
which
formed
the
ridges
and
chains
on
her
surface
began
to
be
plainly
visible
through
the
telescope
whilst
on
the
shaded
side
several
volcanoes
appeared
upon
her
disc
like
the
flashes
of
our
or
rather
like
the
twinkling
of
stars
in
a
frosty
night
he
remarked
that
the
extraordinary
clearness
and
brightness
of
the
objects
on
the
moon
surface
was
owing
to
her
having
a
less
extensive
and
more
transparent
atmosphere
than
the
earth
adding
difference
is
so
great
that
some
of
our
astronomical
observers
have
been
induced
to
think
she
has
none
if
that
however
had
been
the
case
our
voyage
would
have
been
impracticable
after
gazing
for
some
time
on
this
magnificent
spectacle
with
admiration
and
delight
one
of
their
balls
of
was
let
off
for
the
purpose
of
checking
their
velocity
at
this
time
the
brahmin
supposed
they
were
not
more
than
four
thousand
miles
from
the
nearest
point
of
the
moon
surface
in
about
four
hours
more
her
apparent
magnitude
was
so
great
that
they
could
see
her
by
looking
out
of
either
of
the
side
windows
her
disc
had
now
lost
its
former
silvery
appearance
and
began
to
look
more
like
that
of
the
earth
when
seen
at
the
same
distance
it
was
a
most
gratifying
spectacle
to
behold
the
objects
successively
rising
to
our
view
and
steadily
enlarging
in
their
dimensions
the
rapidity
with
which
we
approached
the
moon
impressed
me
in
spite
of
myself
with
the
alarming
sensation
of
falling
and
i
found
myself
alternately
agitated
with
a
sense
of
this
danger
and
with
impatience
to
take
a
nearer
view
of
the
new
objects
that
greeted
my
eyes
the
brahmin
was
wholly
absorbed
in
calculations
for
the
purpose
of
adjusting
our
velocity
to
the
distance
we
had
to
go
his
estimates
of
which
however
were
in
a
great
measure
conjectural
and
ever
and
anon
he
would
let
off
a
ball
of
the
lunar
metal
after
a
few
hours
we
were
so
near
the
moon
that
every
object
was
seen
in
our
glass
as
distinctly
as
the
shells
or
marine
plants
through
a
piece
of
shallow
though
the
eye
could
take
in
but
a
small
part
of
her
surface
and
the
horizon
which
bounded
our
view
was
rapidly
contracting
on
letting
the
air
escape
from
our
machine
it
did
not
now
rush
out
with
the
same
violence
as
before
which
showed
that
we
were
within
the
moon
atmosphere
this
as
well
as
ridding
ourselves
of
the
metal
balls
aided
in
checking
our
progress
by
and
by
we
were
within
a
few
miles
of
the
highest
mountains
when
we
threw
down
so
much
of
our
ballast
that
we
soon
appeared
almost
stationary
the
brahmin
remarked
that
he
should
avail
himself
of
the
currents
of
air
we
might
meet
with
to
select
a
favourable
place
for
landing
though
we
were
necessarily
attracted
towards
the
same
region
in
consequence
of
the
same
half
of
the
moon
surface
being
always
turned
towards
the
earth
the
brahmin
now
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
looking
out
for
some
cultivated
field
in
one
of
the
valleys
they
were
approaching
where
they
might
rely
on
being
not
far
distant
from
some
human
habitation
and
on
escaping
the
perils
necessarily
attendant
on
a
descent
amongst
rocks
trees
and
buildings
a
gentle
breeze
now
arising
as
appeared
by
their
horizontal
motion
which
wafted
them
at
the
rate
of
about
ten
miles
an
hour
over
a
ridge
of
mountains
a
lake
a
thick
wood
they
at
length
reached
a
cultivated
region
which
the
brahmin
recognised
as
the
country
of
the
morosofs
the
place
they
were
anxious
to
visit
by
now
letting
off
two
balls
of
lead
to
the
they
descended
rapidly
and
when
they
were
sufficiently
near
the
ground
to
observe
that
it
was
a
fit
place
for
landing
opened
the
door
of
their
balloon
and
found
the
air
of
the
moon
inconceivably
sweet
and
refreshing
they
now
let
loose
one
of
their
lower
balls
which
somewhat
retarded
their
descent
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
being
within
twenty
yards
of
the
ground
they
let
go
the
largest
ball
of
lunarium
which
having
a
cord
attached
to
it
served
in
lieu
of
a
grapnel
by
this
they
drew
themselves
down
were
disengaged
from
the
machine
in
a
twinkling
and
landed
safe
and
sound
on
we
presume
firma
having
seen
our
travellers
securely
deposited
in
the
moon
we
may
remark
that
in
the
passage
from
the
earth
various
topics
of
an
interesting
and
important
character
were
canvassed
by
the
brahmin
and
his
companion
one
the
causes
of
national
suggested
by
the
views
of
africa
and
a
comparison
between
that
benighted
country
and
others
more
illuminated
is
especially
worthy
of
attention
as
containing
a
condensed
and
philosophical
view
of
the
subject
eloquently
and
perspicuously
conveyed
the
view
of
america
suggests
some
remarks
on
the
peculiarities
of
the
united
with
speculations
on
their
future
destiny
a
lively
description
of
the
contrast
between
the
circumstances
of
the
kamtschadale
the
shuddering
tenant
of
the
frigid
zone
and
the
gay
voluptuous
native
of
the
sandwich
and
other
isles
within
the
tropics
the
one
passing
his
life
in
toil
privation
and
care
the
other
in
ease
abundance
and
enjoyment
leads
to
a
similar
conclusion
to
that
expressed
by
goldsmith
and
yet
perhaps
if
countries
we
compare
and
estimate
the
blessings
which
they
share
though
patriots
flatter
still
shall
wisdom
find
an
equal
portion
dealt
to
all
mankind
a
disquisition
also
takes
place
india
or
egypt
were
the
parent
of
the
arts
this
leads
them
to
refer
to
the
strange
custom
in
the
country
of
the
brahmin
which
impels
the
widow
to
throw
herself
on
the
funeral
pile
and
be
consumed
with
her
husband
i
told
him
says
atterley
that
it
had
often
been
represented
as
compulsory
or
in
other
words
that
it
was
said
that
every
art
and
means
were
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
working
on
the
mind
of
the
woman
by
her
relatives
aided
by
the
priests
who
would
be
naturally
gratified
by
such
signal
triumphs
of
religion
over
the
strongest
feelings
of
nature
he
admitted
that
these
engines
were
sometimes
put
in
operation
and
that
they
impelled
to
the
sacrifice
some
who
were
wavering
but
insisted
that
in
a
majority
of
instances
the
was
voluntary
said
he
brought
up
from
their
infancy
to
regard
our
sex
as
their
superiors
and
to
believe
that
their
greatest
merit
consists
in
entire
devotion
to
their
husbands
under
this
feeling
and
having
at
the
same
time
their
attention
frequently
turned
to
the
chance
of
such
a
calamity
they
are
better
prepared
to
meet
it
when
it
occurs
how
few
of
the
officers
in
your
western
armies
ever
hesitate
to
march
at
the
head
of
their
men
on
a
forlorn
hope
and
how
many
even
court
the
danger
for
the
sake
of
the
glory
nay
you
tell
me
that
according
to
your
code
of
honour
if
one
man
insults
another
he
who
gives
the
provocation
and
he
who
receives
it
rather
than
be
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
their
countrymen
will
go
out
and
quietly
shoot
at
each
other
with
till
one
of
them
is
killed
or
wounded
and
this
too
in
many
cases
when
the
injury
has
been
merely
nominal
if
you
show
such
a
contempt
of
death
in
deference
to
a
custom
founded
in
mere
caprice
can
it
be
wondered
that
a
woman
should
show
it
in
the
first
paroxysms
of
her
grief
for
the
loss
of
him
to
whom
was
devoted
every
thought
word
and
action
of
her
life
and
who
next
to
her
god
was
the
object
of
her
idolatry
my
dear
atterley
he
continued
with
emotion
little
know
the
strength
of
love
other
topics
of
interest
are
also
discussed
with
the
like
ingenuity
after
this
episode
it
is
time
for
us
to
return
to
our
travellers
whose
feelings
the
moment
they
touched
the
ground
repayed
them
for
all
they
had
endured
atterley
looked
around
with
the
most
intense
curiosity
but
nothing
he
saw
surprised
him
so
much
as
to
find
so
little
that
was
surprising
vegetation
insects
and
other
animals
were
pretty
much
of
the
same
character
as
those
he
had
before
seen
but
on
better
acquaintance
he
found
the
difference
greater
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
having
refreshed
themselves
with
the
remains
of
their
stores
and
secured
the
door
of
the
machine
they
bent
their
course
to
the
town
of
alamatua
about
three
miles
distant
which
seemed
to
contain
about
two
thousand
houses
and
to
be
not
quite
as
large
as
albany
the
people
were
tall
and
thin
and
of
a
pale
yellowish
complexion
their
garments
light
loose
and
flowing
and
not
very
different
from
those
of
the
turks
they
subsist
chiefly
on
a
vegetable
diet
live
about
as
long
as
we
do
on
the
earth
notwithstanding
the
great
difference
of
climate
and
other
circumstances
and
do
not
in
their
manners
habits
or
character
differ
more
from
the
inhabitants
of
this
globe
than
some
of
the
latter
do
from
one
another
their
government
anciently
monarchical
is
now
popular
their
code
of
laws
very
intricate
their
language
naturally
soft
and
musical
has
been
yet
further
refined
by
the
cultivation
of
letters
and
they
have
a
variety
of
sects
in
religion
politics
and
philosophy
the
lunarians
do
not
as
butler
has
it
when
the
sun
shines
hot
at
noon
inhabit
cellars
under
ground
of
eight
miles
deep
and
eighty
round
but
one
half
of
their
houses
is
beneath
the
surface
partly
for
the
purpose
of
screening
them
from
the
continued
action
of
the
sun
rays
and
partly
on
account
of
the
earthquakes
caused
by
volcanoes
the
windows
of
the
houses
consisted
of
openings
in
the
wall
sloping
so
much
upwards
that
whilst
they
freely
admitted
the
light
and
air
the
sun
was
completely
excluded
as
soon
as
they
were
espied
by
the
natives
great
curiosity
was
of
course
excited
not
however
to
so
troublesome
an
extent
as
might
have
been
from
the
circumstance
of
the
brahmin
having
visited
the
moon
before
hence
he
was
soon
recognised
by
some
of
his
acquaintances
and
conducted
to
the
house
of
the
governor
by
whom
they
were
graciously
received
and
who
began
a
course
of
interesting
inquiries
regarding
the
affairs
of
the
earth
but
a
gentleman
whom
they
afterwards
understood
to
be
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
popular
party
coming
in
he
soon
despatched
them
having
however
first
directed
an
officer
to
furnish
them
with
all
that
was
necessary
for
their
accommodation
at
the
public
expense
which
act
of
hospitality
they
had
reason
to
fear
occasioned
him
some
trouble
and
perplexity
at
the
succeeding
election
a
more
minute
description
follows
of
the
dress
of
the
male
and
female
lunarians
especially
of
that
of
the
latter
to
which
we
can
merely
refer
the
reader
there
is
one
portion
however
of
the
inhabitants
with
whom
the
reader
must
be
made
acquainted
inasmuch
as
they
form
some
of
the
author
most
prominent
characters
a
large
number
of
lunarians
it
seems
are
born
without
any
intellectual
vigour
and
wander
about
like
so
many
automatons
under
the
care
of
the
government
until
illumined
by
the
mental
ray
from
some
terrestrial
brain
through
the
mysterious
influence
which
the
moon
is
known
to
exercise
on
our
planet
but
in
this
case
the
inhabitant
of
the
earth
loses
what
he
of
the
moon
gains
the
ordinary
portion
of
understanding
being
divided
between
two
and
as
might
be
expected
there
is
a
most
exact
conformity
between
the
man
of
the
earth
and
his
counterpart
in
the
moon
in
all
their
principles
of
action
and
modes
of
thinking
these
glonglims
as
they
are
called
after
they
have
been
thus
imbued
with
intellect
are
held
in
peculiar
respect
by
the
vulgar
and
are
thought
to
be
in
every
way
superior
to
those
whose
understandings
are
entire
the
laws
by
which
two
objects
so
far
apart
operate
on
each
other
have
been
as
yet
but
imperfectly
developed
and
the
wilder
their
freaks
the
more
they
are
the
objects
of
wonder
and
admiration
now
and
then
though
very
rarely
the
man
of
the
earth
regains
the
intellect
he
has
lost
in
which
case
his
lunar
counterpart
returns
to
his
former
state
of
imbecility
both
parties
are
entirely
unconscious
of
the
change
one
of
what
he
has
lost
and
the
other
of
what
he
has
gained
the
belief
of
the
influence
of
the
moon
on
the
human
intellect
the
brahmin
remarks
may
be
perceived
in
the
opinions
of
the
vulgar
and
in
many
of
the
ordinary
forms
of
expression
and
he
takes
occasion
to
remark
that
these
very
opinions
as
well
as
some
obscure
hints
in
the
sanscrit
give
countenance
to
the
idea
that
they
were
not
the
only
voyagers
to
the
moon
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
voyage
had
been
performed
in
remote
antiquity
and
the
lunarians
we
are
told
have
a
similar
tradition
many
ordinary
forms
of
expression
are
adduced
in
support
of
these
ideas
thus
says
the
brahmin
it
is
generally
believed
throughout
all
asia
that
the
moon
has
an
influence
on
the
brain
and
when
a
man
is
of
insane
mind
we
call
him
a
lunatic
one
of
the
curses
of
the
common
people
is
the
moon
eat
up
your
brains
and
in
china
they
say
of
a
man
who
has
done
any
act
of
egregious
folly
was
gathering
wool
in
the
moon
i
was
struck
with
these
remarks
and
told
the
hermit
that
the
language
of
europe
afforded
the
same
indirect
evidence
of
the
fact
he
mentioned
that
my
own
language
especially
abounded
with
expressions
which
could
be
explained
on
no
other
hypothesis
for
besides
the
terms
lunacy
lunatic
and
the
supposed
influence
of
the
moon
on
the
brain
when
we
see
symptoms
of
a
disordered
intellect
we
say
the
mind
which
evidently
alludes
to
a
part
of
it
rambling
to
a
distant
region
as
is
the
moon
we
say
too
a
man
is
of
his
that
is
his
mind
being
in
another
head
must
of
course
be
out
of
his
own
to
know
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
is
a
proverbial
expression
for
ignorance
and
is
without
meaning
unless
it
be
considered
to
refer
to
the
glonglims
we
say
that
an
insane
man
is
by
which
we
mean
that
his
mind
is
drawn
two
different
ways
so
also
we
call
a
lunatic
man
beside
which
most
distinctly
expresses
the
two
distinct
bodies
his
mind
now
animates
there
are
moreover
many
other
analogous
expressions
as
and
some
others
which
altogether
form
a
mass
of
concurring
testimony
that
it
is
impossible
to
resist
leaving
this
ingenious
with
the
defence
of
the
serious
and
sentimental
schiller
hoher
sinn

oft
in
kindischen
spiele
we
return
to
our
travellers
who
at
their
lodgings
meet
with
an
instance
of
the
family
eating
those
portions
of
fruits
vegetables
which
are
thrown
away
by
us
and
from
a
persuasion
that
all
pleasure
received
through
the
senses
is
sinful
and
that
man
never
appears
so
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
the
deity
as
when
he
rejects
all
the
delicacies
of
the
palate
as
well
as
other
sensual
gratifications
and
imposes
on
himself
that
food
to
which
he
feels
naturally
most
repugnant
is
satirized
by
the
story
of
one
of
these
glonglims
who
is
occupied
in
making
nails
and
then
dropping
them
into
a
well
refusing
to
exchange
them
for
bread
or
clothes
notwithstanding
his
starved
haggard
appearance
and
evident
desire
for
the
food
proffered
mettant

and
this
is
followed
by
a
picture
of
in
another
glonglim
we
pass
over
the
description
of
the
physical
peculiarities
of
the
moon
which
seem
to
be
according
to
the
received
opinions
of
astronomers
as
well
as
the
satire
on
in
the
persons
of
the
hilliboos
and
moriboos
and
that
on
the
godwinian
system
of
morals
an
indisposition
experienced
by
atterley
occasions
his
introduction
to
vindar
a
celebrated
physician
botanist
on
whose
opinions
we
have
a
keen
satire
on
leaving
vindar
house
they
observed
a
short
man
napoleon
preparing
to
climb
to
the
top
of
a
plane
tree
on
which
there
was
one
of
the
tail
feathers
of
a
flamingo
and
this
he
would
only
mount
in
one
way
on
the
shoulders
of
his
men
i
could
not
see
this
rash
glonglim
attempt
to
climb
that
dangerous
ladder
without
feeling
alarm
for
his
safety
at
first
all
seemed
to
go
on
very
well
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
lay
hold
of
the
gaudy
prize
there
arose
a
sudden
squall
which
threw
both
him
and
his
supporters
into
confusion
and
the
whole
living
pyramid
came
to
the
ground
together
many
were
killed
some
were
wounded
and
bruised
polenap
himself
by
lighting
on
his
men
who
served
him
as
cushions
barely
escaped
with
life
but
he
received
a
fracture
in
the
upper
part
of
his
head
and
a
dislocation
of
the
hip
which
will
not
only
prevent
him
from
ever
climbing
again
but
probably
make
him
a
cripple
for
life
the
brahmin
and
i
endeavoured
to
give
the
sufferers
some
assistance
but
this
was
rendered
unnecessary
by
the
crowd
which
their
cries
and
lamentations
brought
to
their
relief
i
thought
that
the
author
of
so
much
mischief
would
have
been
stoned
on
the
spot
but
to
my
surprise
his
servants
seemed
to
feel
as
much
for
his
honour
as
their
own
safety
and
warmly
interfered
in
his
behalf
until
they
had
somewhat
appeased
the
rage
of
the
surrounding
multitude
the
of
the
of
lavater
and
of
the
of
mm
gall
and
spurzheim
were
not
likely
to
escape
animadversion
in
a
work
of
general
satire
fruitful
as
they
have
already
been
in
such
themes
the
representative
of
the
former
is
a
philosopher
avarabet
lavater
whose
course
of
proceeding
was
to
examine
the
finger
nails
and
according
to
their
form
colour
thickness
surface
grain
and
other
properties
to
determine
the
character
and
destinies
of
those
who
consulted
him
and
that
of
the
latter
a
physician
who
judged
of
the
character
of
disposition
or
disease
by
the
examination
of
a
lock
of
the
hair
the
upshot
of
the
story
is
as
might
be
anticipated
that
the
philosopher
is
caught
and
exposed
in
his
own
toils
the
of
privateers
and
of
letters
of
marque
and
is
next
animadverted
on
by
the
story
of
two
neighbours
who
are
at
variance
and
whose
dependants
are
occupied
in
laying
hold
of
what
they
can
of
each
other
flocks
and
herds
and
doing
as
much
mischief
as
possible
by
which
both
parties
of
necessity
suffer
a
visit
to
a
projector
in
building
husbandry
and
cookery
introduces
us
to
some
inventions
not
unworthy
of
the
occupation
of
the
courtiers
of
reine
or
of
the
professors
of
the
academy
of
lagado
the
doctrine
of
the
aerial
formation
of
meteoric
stones
receives
too
a
passing
notice
from
our
author
who
is
clearly
no
supporter
of
it
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
ancients
received
credit
for
their
stories
of
showers
of
stones
and
all
were
ready
to
joke
with
butler
at
the
story
of
the
thracian
rock
which
fell
in
the
river
aegos
for
anaxagoras
long
agon
saw
hills
as
well
as
you
moon
and
held
the
sun
was
but
a
piece
of
red
hot
iron
as
big
as
greece
believ
the
heavens
were
made
of
stone
because
the
sun
had
voided
one
and
rather
than
he
would
recant
th
opinion
suffered
banishment
a
difficulty
surrounds
the
subject
however
we
view
it
as
they
have
been
designated
have
now
been
found
in
almost
every
region
and
climate
of
the
globe
from
arabia
to
the
farthest
point
of
baffin
bay
and
this
very
circumstance
would
seem
to
be
opposed
to
their
aerial
origin
unless
we
are
to
suppose
that
they
can
be
formed
in
every
state
and
in
the
opposite
extremes
of
the
atmosphere
the
brahmin
assigns
them
a
lunar
origin
and
adds
our
party
were
greatly
amused
at
the
disputations
of
a
learned
society
in
europe
in
which
they
undertook
to
give
a
mathematical
demonstration
that
they
could
not
be
thrown
from
a
volcano
of
the
earth
nor
from
the
moon
but
were
suddenly
formed
in
the
atmosphere
i
should
as
soon
believe
that
a
loaf
of
bread
could
be
made
and
baked
in
the
atmosphere
the
gentleman
farmer
and
projector
being
attacked
during
their
visit
with
cholera
morbus
and
considering
himself
a
consultation
of
physicians
takes
place
in
which
one
portrait
will
be
obvious
that
of
shuro
who
asserts
disease
to
be
a
unit
and
that
it
is
the
extreme
of
folly
to
divide
diseases
into
classes
which
tend
but
to
produce
confusion
of
ideas
and
an
unscientific
practice
the
enthusiasm
of
the
justly
celebrated
individual
the
original
of
this
portrait
was
so
great
that
the
slightest
data
were
sufficient
for
the
formation
of
some
of
his
most
elaborate
for
they
could
not
properly
be
called
and
accordingly
many
of
his
beautiful
and
ingenious
superstructures
are
now
prostrated
leaving
in
open
day
the
insufficiency
of
their
foundation
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
this
nature
was
his
belief
that
the
black
colour
of
the
negro
is
a
disease
which
depletion
properly
exercised
might
be
capable
of
remedying
a
scheme
not
a
whit
more
feasible
than
that
of
the
courtiers
of
reine
referred
to
by
rabelais
who
made
blackamoors
white
as
fast
as
hops
by
just
rubbing
their
stomachs
with
the
bottom
of
a
pannier
the
satire
here
is
not
so
fortunately
displayed
as
in
other
instances
owing
probably
to
the
difficulty
of
saying
any
thing
new
on
so
hackneyed
a
subject
for
it
has
ever
happened
that
the
galenist
and
paracelsian
condemn
the
way
each
other
deals
in
the
affair
concludes
by
the
doctors
quarrelling
and
in
the
mean
time
the
patient
profiting
by
some
simple
remedies
administered
by
the
brahmin
and
an
hour
rest
was
so
much
refreshed
that
he
considered
himself
out
of
danger
and
had
no
need
of
medical
assistance
system
of
is
with
justice
satirized
since
instead
of
affording
facilities
to
the
student
as
the
superficial
observer
might
fancy
it
retards
his
acquisition
of
knowledge
by
teaching
him
to
exercise
his
external
senses
rather
than
his
reflection
in
a
attached
to
an
academy
in
which
youths
of
maturer
years
were
instructed
in
the
fine
arts
the

an
opportunity
of
observing
the
vain
attempts
of

allusion
to

account

here
represented
under
the
character
of
gambling
transactions
and
if
we
mistake
not
there
is
a
distinct
allusion
to
more
than
one
important
contest
in
the
annals
of
this
country
having
now
satisfied
his
curiosity
atterley
became
anxious
to
return
to
his
native
planet
and
accordingly
urged
the
brahmin
to
lose
no
time
in
preparing
for
their
departure
they
were
soon
however
informed
that
a
man
high
in
office
by
way
of
affecting
political
sagacity
had
proposed
to
detain
them
on
the
ground
that
when
such
voyages
as
their
were
shown
to
be
practicable
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
who
were
so
much
more
numerous
than
those
of
the
moon
might
invade
the
latter
with
a
large
army
for
the
purpose
of
rapine
and
contest
but
notwithstanding
the
influence
of
this
sapient
politician
they
finally
obtained
leave
to
quit
the
moon
whenever
they
thought
proper
having
taken
a
respectful
or
affectionate
leave
of
all
their
lunarian
friends
and
got
every
thing
in
readiness
at
midnight
of
the
twentieth
of
august
they
again
entered
their
copper
and
after
they
had
ascended
until
the
face
of
the
moon
looked
like
one
vast
lake
of
melted
silver
with
here
and
there
small
pieces
of
grayish
dross
floating
on
it
atterley
reminded
the
brahmin
of
a
former
promise
to
detail
the
history
of
his
early
life
to
which
he
assented
of
this
perhaps
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
book
to
the
general
reader
we
regret
that
our
limits
will
only
admit
of
our
giving
a
very
condensed
and
imperfect
narrative
gurameer
the
brahmin
was
born
at
benares
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
priest
of
vishnu
of
rank
and
was
himself
intended
for
the
priesthood
at
school
he
meets
with
a
boy
of
the
name
of
between
whom
and
himself
a
degree
of
rivalry
and
subsequently
the
most
decided
enmity
existed
a
circumstance
that
decided
the
character
of
gurameer
subsequent
life
they
afterwards
met
at
college
where
a
more
extended
theatre
was
afforded
for
the
exercise
of
balty
mahu
malignity
during
a
vacation
gurameer
being
on
a
visit
to
an
uncle
in
the
country
one
day
when
the
family
had
gone
to
witness
a
grand
spectacle
in
honour
of
an
important
festival
in
their
calendar
which
he
could
not
himself
attend
consistently
with
the
rules
of
his
caste
was
tempted
to
visit
the
deserted
zenana
or
ladies
apartment
where
he
accidentally
meets
with
a
beautiful
young
female
the
acquaintance
thus
begun
soon
ripened
into
intimacy
by
means
of
walks
in
the
garden
contrived
by
fatima
one
of
his
female
cousins
at
length
they
are
constrained
to
separate
veenah
for
so
the
young
lady
is
named
returns
to
benares
whither
gurameer
soon
follows
her
on
making
his
father
acquainted
with
his
attachment
the
latter
endeavours
to
persuade
him
to
overcome
it
and
informs
him
that
veenah
father
is
avaricious
and
a
bigot
and
hence
that
he
would
probably
be
prejudiced
against
him
owing
to
some
imputations
which
had
been
cast
on
gurameer
religious
creed
and
industriously
circulated
by
his
old
enemy
balty
mahu
who
proves
to
be
the
cousin
of
veenah
these
considerations
prevail
upon
gurameer
to
defer
any
application
to
veenah
father
until
the
suspicions
regarding
his
faith
had
either
died
away
or
been
falsified
by
his
scrupulous
observance
of
all
religious
duties
this
resolution
he
determines
to
communicate
to
his
mistress
accordingly
in
the
evening
he
betakes
himself
to
the
quarter
of
the
city
where
veenah
father
lives
and
walking
to
and
fro
before
the
house
soon
discovers
that
he
is
recognised
by
a
cord
let
down
from
the
window
he
conveys
a
letter
to
her
which
the
following
evening
she
answers
and
thus
a
regular
correspondence
was
kept
up
which
by
the
exercise
it
afforded
to
their
imaginations
and
the
difficulties
attendant
upon
it
inflamed
their
passion
to
the
highest
pitch
he
had
however
soon
the
misfortune
to
be
discovered
by
balty
mahu
and
in
consequence
veenah
is
debarred
from
pen
and
ink
but
contrives
to
acquaint
her
lover
that
their
intercourse
has
been
discovered
by
a
short
note
written
with
a
burnt
stick
gurameer
now
goes
in
despair
to
veenah
father
from
whom
he
experiences
a
haughty
repulse
and
who
in
the
following
night
secretly
leaves
the
city
with
his
daughter
embarking
on
the
ganges
and
taking
measures
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
the
place
of
his
retreat
at
the
expiration
of
two
or
three
months
an
end
is
put
to
gurameer
doubts
and
apprehensions
by
his
return
with
his
daughter
and
a
rich
omrah
four
times
her
age
after
the
first
ebullitions
of
rage
have
subsided
his
love
returns
but
he
is
never
able
to
succeed
in
obtaining
an
interview
with
veenah
by
his
cousin
fatima
he
learns
the
circumstances
of
veenah
marriage
and
the
deceptions
which
had
been
practised
on
her
aided
by
the
unbounded
authority
which
parents
exercise
in
eastern
countries
the
unhappy
veenah
as
firm
in
her
principles
as
she
was
gentle
in
disposition
refuses
to
see
him
tell
him
said
she
that
heaven
has
forbidden
it
and
to
its
decrees
we
are
bound
to
submit
i
am
now
the
wife
of
another
and
it
is
our
duty
to
forget
all
that
is
past
but
if
this
be
possible
my
heart
tells
me
it
can
be
only
by
our
never
meeting
gurameer
now
fell
into
a
state
of
settled
melancholy
and
consented
to
travel
more
for
the
purpose
of
pleasing
his
parents
than
from
any
concern
for
his
own
health
but
travelling
had
little
effect
he
carried
a
barbed
arrow
in
his
heart
and
the
greater
the
efforts
to
extract
it
the
more
they
rankled
the
wound
when
so
much
emaciated
that
he
was
not
expected
to
live
a
month
he
took
a
voyage
coastwise
to
madras
and
on
his
arrival
there
learned
that
balty
mahu
had
recently
left
that
place
this
intelligence
operated
like
a
charm
the
desire
of
revenge
roused
all
his
energies
and
became
his
master
passion
he
immediately
set
off
in
pursuit
but
although
often
near
could
never
overtake
him
his
health
rapidly
improves
and
at
length
he
hears
that
the
old
omrah
health
is
rapidly
declining
this
information
awakens
new
thoughts
and
hopes
and
balty
mahu
is
forgotten
he
hastens
hack
to
benares
and
when
near
the
city
hears
two
merchants
in
conversation
remark
that
the
omrah
is
dead
and
that
his
widow
was
the
next
day
to
perform
the
he
immediately
mounts
his
horse
and
reaches
the
city
the
next
morning
at
sunrise
in
the
street
he
mixes
with
the
throng
hears
veenah
pitied
her
father
blamed
and
himself
lamented
he
now
sees
veenah
approach
the
funeral
pile
who
at
the
well
known
sound
of
his
voice
shrieked
out
he
lives
he
lives
and
would
have
attempted
to
save
herself
from
the
flames
but
the
shouts
of
the
surrounding
multitude
and
the
sound
of
the
instruments
drowned
her
voice
he
now
attempts
to
approach
the
pile
for
the
purpose
of
rescuing
her
but
is
forcibly
held
back
until
the
wretched
veenah
is
enveloped
in
flames
on
his
again
attempting
to
reach
the
pile
he
was
charged
with
profanation
and
on
balty
mahu
making
his
appearance
and
encouraging
the
charge
in
frantic
desperation
he
seizes
a
scymetar
from
one
of
the
guards
and
plunges
it
in
his
breast
the
influence
of
his
friends
and
the
sacred
character
of
persons
of
his
caste
saved
the
brahmin
from
capital
punishment
but
he
was
banished
from
hindostan
he
now
removed
to
the
kingdom
of
ava
where
he
continued
so
long
as
his
parents
lived
after
which
he
visited
several
countries
both
of
asia
and
europe
and
in
one
of
his
journeys
having
discovered
lunarium
ore
in
the
mountain
near
mogaun
he
determined
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
that
secluded
so
ends
this
strange
eventful
history
when
the
brahmin
terminated
his
narrative
the
extended
map
beneath
them
was
already
assuming
a
distinct
and
varied
appearance
the
brahmin
having
applied
his
eye
to
the
telescope
and
made
a
brief
calculation
of
our
progress
considered
that
hours
more
if
no
accident
interrupted
us
would
end
our
voyage
part
of
which
interval
i
passed
in
making
notes
in
my
journal
and
in
contemplating
the
different
sections
of
our
many
peopled
globe
as
they
presented
themselves
successively
to
the
eye
it
was
my
wish
to
land
on
the
american
continent
and
if
possible
in
the
united
states
but
the
brahmin
put
an
end
to
that
hope
by
reminding
me
that
we
should
be
attracted
towards
the
equator
and
that
we
had
to
choose
between
asia
africa
and
south
america
and
that
our
only
course
would
be
to
check
the
progress
of
our
car
over
the
country
of
greatest
extent
through
which
the
equinoctial
circle
might
pass
saying
which
he
relapsed
into
his
melancholy
silence
and
i
betook
myself
once
more
to
the
telescope
with
a
bosom
throbbing
with
emotion
i
saw
that
we
were
descending
towards
the
american
continent
when
we
were
about
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
the
earth
the
brahmin
arrested
the
progress
of
the
car
and
we
hovered
over
the
broad
atlantic
looking
down
on
the
ocean
the
first
object
which
presented
itself
to
my
eye
was
a
small
shallop
which
was
buffetting
the
waves
in
a
direction
i
presumed
it
was
a
trader
on
a
voyage
to
some
part
of
the
republic
of
colombia
and
by
way
of
diverting
my
friend
from
his
melancholy
reverie
i
told
him
some
of
the
many
stories
which
are
current
respecting
the
enterprise
and
ingenuity
of
this
portion
of
my
countrymen
and
above
all
their
adroitness
at
a
bargain
says
the
brahmin
are
describing
a
native
of
canton
or
pekin
but
added
he
after
a
short
pause
to
a
superficial
observer
man
appears
to
put
on
very
different
characters
to
a
philosopher
he
is
every
where
the
same
for
he
is
every
where
moulded
by
the
circumstances
in
which
he
is
placed
thus
let
him
be
in
a
situation
that
is
propitious
to
commerce
and
the
habits
of
traffic
produce
in
him
shrewdness
and
address
trade
is
carried
on
chiefly
in
towns
because
it
is
there
carried
on
most
advantageously
this
situation
gives
the
trader
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
his
species
a
more
ready
insight
into
character
and
of
the
modes
of
operating
on
it
his
chief
purpose
is
to
buy
as
cheap
and
to
sell
as
dear
as
he
can
and
he
is
often
able
to
heighten
the
recommendations
or
soften
the
defects
of
some
of
the
articles
in
which
he
deals
without
danger
of
immediate
detection
or
in
other
words
big
representations
have
some
influence
with
his
customers
he
avails
himself
of
this
circumstance
and
thus
acquires
the
habit
of
lying
but
as
he
is
studious
to
conceal
it
he
becomes
wary
ingenious
and
cunning
it
is
thus
that
the
phenicians
the
carthagenians
the
dutch
the
chinese
the
and
the
modern
greeks
have
always
been
regarded
as
inclined
to
petty
frauds
by
their
less
commercial
neighbours
i
mentioned
the
english
nation
the
english
said
he
interrupting
me
are
the
most
commercial
people
of
modern
times
have
not
acquired
the
same
character
it
is
because
they
are
as
distinguished
for
other
things
as
for
traffic
they
are
not
merely
a
commercial
people
they
are
also
agricultural
warlike
and
literary
and
thus
the
natural
tendencies
of
commerce
are
mutually
counteracted
we
afterwards
descended
slowly
the
prospect
beneath
us
becoming
more
beautiful
than
my
humble
pen
can
hope
to
describe
or
will
even
attempt
to
portray
in
a
short
time
after
we
were
in
sight
of
venezuela
we
met
with
the
trade
winds
and
were
carried
by
them
forty
or
fifty
miles
inland
where
with
some
difficulty
and
even
danger
we
landed
the
brahmin
and
myself
remained
together
two
days
and
parted
he
to
explore
the
andes
to
obtain
additional
light
on
the
subject
of
his
hypothesis
and
i
on
the
wings
of
impatience
to
visit
once
more
my
family
and
friends
but
before
our
separation
i
assisted
my
friend
in
concealing
our
aerial
vessel
and
received
a
promise
from
him
to
visit
and
perhaps
spend
with
me
the
evening
of
his
life
of
my
journey
home
little
remains
to
be
said
from
the
citizens
of
colombia
i
experienced
kindness
and
attention
and
means
of
conveyance
to
caraccas
where
embarking
on
board
the
brig
juno
captain
withers
i
once
more
set
foot
in
on
the
of
august
after
an
absence
of
four
years
resolved
for
the
rest
of
my
life
to
travel
only
in
books
and
persuaded
from
experience
that
the
satisfaction
which
the
wanderer
gains
from
actually
beholding
the
wonders
and
curiosities
of
distant
climes
is
dearly
bought
by
the
sacrifice
of
all
the
comforts
and
delights
of
home
we
have
thus
placed
before
the
reader
an
analysis
of
this
interesting
satirical
romance
the
time
and
space
we
have
occupied
sufficiently
indicate
the
favourable
sentiments
respecting
it
with
which
we
have
been
impressed
of
the
execution
of
the
satires
from
the
several
extracts
we
have
given
the
reader
will
himself
be
enabled
to
judge
this
is
of
course
unequal
but
generally
felicitous
in
the
personal
allusions
which
occur
through
the
work
the
author
exhibits
as
we
have
before
noticed
a
freedom
from
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
and
in
many
of
them
has
attained
that
happy
which
dryden
considered
a
matter
of
so
much
difficulty
how
easy
is
it
he
observes
to
call
rogue
and
villain
and
that
wittily
but
how
hard
to
make
a
man
appear
a
fool
a
blockhead
or
a
knave
without
using
any
of
those
opprobrious
terms
to
spare
the
grossness
of
the
names
and
to
do
the
thing
yet
more
severely
is
to
draw
a
full
face
and
to
make
the
nose
and
cheeks
stand
out
and
yet
not
to
employ
any
depth
of
shadowing
this
is
the
mystery
of
that
noble
trade
which
yet
no
master
can
teach
to
his
apprentice
he
may
give
the
rules
but
the
scholar
is
never
the
nearer
in
his
practice
neither
is
it
true
that
this
fineness
of
raillery
is
offensive
a
witty
man
is
tickled
while
he
is
hurt
in
this
manner
and
a
fool
feels
it
not
the
occasion
of
an
offence
may
possibly
be
given
but
he
can
not
take
it
if
it
be
granted
that
in
effect
this
way
does
more
mischief
that
a
man
is
secretly
wounded
and
though
he
be
not
sensible
himself
yet
the
malicious
world
will
find
it
out
for
him
yet
there
is
still
a
vast
difference
betwixt
the
slovenly
butchering
of
a
man
and
the
fineness
of
a
stroke
that
separates
the
head
from
the
body
and
leaves
it
standing
in
its
place
a
man
may
be
capable
as
jack
ketch
wife
said
of
his
servant
of
a
plain
piece
of
work
a
bare
hanging
but
to
make
a
malefactor
die
sweetly
was
only
belonging
to
her
husband
in
conclusion
we
must
express
our
regret
that
the
author
should
not
have
added
notes
to
the
work
the
want
of
them
will
be
seriously
felt
by
every
one
some
of
the
satires
indeed
must
escape
the
reader
unless
he
pay
a
degree
of
attention
which
notes
would
have
rendered
unnecessary
in
his
next
edition
we
trust
that
this
deficiency
may
be
supplied
and
we
anticipate
as
much
instruction
and
entertainment
from
the
wide
scope
which
such
an
undertaking
will
afford
as
we
have
derived
from
the
perusal
of
the
text
cheerfully

we
extend

him

required
the
leisure
claimed
