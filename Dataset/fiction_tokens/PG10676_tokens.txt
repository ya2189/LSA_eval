introduction
el
filibusterismo
the
second
of
josé
rizal
novels
of
philippine
life
is
a
story
of
the
last
days
of
the
spanish
régime
in
the
philippines
under
the
name
of
reign
of
it
is
for
the
first
time
translated
into
english
written
some
four
or
five
years
after
me
the
book
represents
rizal
more
mature
judgment
on
political
and
social
conditions
in
the
islands
and
in
its
graver
and
less
hopeful
tone
reflects
the
disappointments
and
discouragements
which
he
had
encountered
in
his
efforts
to
lead
the
way
to
reform
rizal
dedication
to
the
first
edition
is
of
special
interest
as
the
writing
of
it
was
one
of
the
grounds
of
accusation
against
him
when
he
was
condemned
to
death
in
it
reads
to
the
memory
of
the
priests
don
mariano
gomez
years
old
don
josé
burgos
years
old
and
don
jacinto
zamora
years
old
executed
in
bagumbayan
field
on
the
of
february
the
church
by
refusing
to
degrade
you
has
placed
in
doubt
the
crime
that
has
been
imputed
to
you
the
government
by
surrounding
your
trials
with
mystery
and
shadows
causes
the
belief
that
there
was
some
error
committed
in
fatal
moments
and
all
the
philippines
by
worshiping
your
memory
and
calling
you
martyrs
in
no
sense
recognizes
your
culpability
in
so
far
therefore
as
your
complicity
in
the
cavite
mutiny
is
not
clearly
proved
as
you
may
or
may
not
have
been
patriots
and
as
you
may
or
may
not
have
cherished
sentiments
for
justice
and
for
liberty
i
have
the
right
to
dedicate
my
work
to
you
as
victims
of
the
evil
which
i
undertake
to
combat
and
while
we
await
expectantly
upon
spain
some
day
to
restore
your
good
name
and
cease
to
be
answerable
for
your
death
let
these
pages
serve
as
a
tardy
wreath
of
dried
leaves
over
your
unknown
tombs
and
let
it
be
understood
that
every
one
who
without
clear
proofs
attacks
your
memory
stains
his
hands
in
your
blood

a
brief
recapitulation
of
the
story
in
me
the
social
cancer
is
essential
to
an
understanding
of
such
plot
as
there
is
in
the
present
work
which
the
author
called
a
continuation
of
the
first
story
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
is
a
young
filipino
who
after
studying
for
seven
years
in
europe
returns
to
his
native
land
to
find
that
his
father
a
wealthy
landowner
has
died
in
prison
as
the
result
of
a
quarrel
with
the
parish
curate
a
franciscan
friar
named
padre
damaso
ibarra
is
engaged
to
a
beautiful
and
accomplished
girl
maria
clara
the
supposed
daughter
and
only
child
of
the
rich
don
santiago
de
los
santos
commonly
known
as
capitan
tiago
a
typical
filipino
cacique
the
predominant
character
fostered
by
the
friar
régime
ibarra
resolves
to
forego
all
quarrels
and
to
work
for
the
betterment
of
his
people
to
show
his
good
intentions
he
seeks
to
establish
at
his
own
expense
a
public
school
in
his
native
town
he
meets
with
ostensible
support
from
all
especially
padre
damaso
successor
a
young
and
gloomy
franciscan
named
padre
salvi
for
whom
maria
clara
confesses
to
an
instinctive
dread
at
the
laying
of
the
for
the
new
schoolhouse
a
suspicious
accident
apparently
aimed
at
ibarra
life
occurs
but
the
festivities
proceed
until
the
dinner
where
ibarra
is
grossly
and
wantonly
insulted
over
the
memory
of
his
father
by
fray
damaso
the
young
man
loses
control
of
himself
and
is
about
to
kill
the
friar
who
is
saved
by
the
intervention
of
maria
clara
ibarra
is
excommunicated
and
capitan
tiago
through
his
fear
of
the
friars
is
forced
to
break
the
engagement
and
agree
to
the
marriage
of
maria
clara
with
a
young
and
inoffensive
spaniard
provided
by
padre
damaso
obedient
to
her
reputed
father
command
and
influenced
by
her
mysterious
dread
of
padre
salvi
maria
clara
consents
to
this
arrangement
but
becomes
seriously
ill
only
to
be
saved
by
medicines
sent
secretly
by
ibarra
and
clandestinely
administered
by
a
girl
friend
ibarra
succeeds
in
having
the
excommunication
removed
but
before
he
can
explain
matters
an
uprising
against
the
civil
guard
is
secretly
brought
about
through
agents
of
padre
salvi
and
the
leadership
is
ascribed
to
ibarra
to
ruin
him
he
is
warned
by
a
mysterious
friend
an
outlaw
called
elias
whose
life
he
had
accidentally
saved
but
desiring
first
to
see
maria
clara
he
refuses
to
make
his
escape
and
when
the
outbreak
occurs
he
is
arrested
as
the
instigator
of
it
and
thrown
into
prison
in
manila
on
the
evening
when
capitan
tiago
gives
a
ball
in
his
manila
house
to
celebrate
his
supposed
daughter
engagement
ibarra
makes
his
escape
from
prison
and
succeeds
in
seeing
maria
clara
alone
he
begins
to
reproach
her
because
it
is
a
letter
written
to
her
before
he
went
to
europe
which
forms
the
basis
of
the
charge
against
him
but
she
clears
herself
of
treachery
to
him
the
letter
had
been
secured
from
her
by
false
representations
and
in
exchange
for
two
others
written
by
her
mother
just
before
her
birth
which
prove
that
padre
damaso
is
her
real
father
these
letters
had
been
accidentally
discovered
in
the
convento
by
padre
salvi
who
made
use
of
them
to
intimidate
the
girl
and
get
possession
of
ibarra
letter
from
which
he
forged
others
to
incriminate
the
young
man
she
tells
him
that
she
will
marry
the
young
spaniard
sacrificing
herself
thus
to
save
her
mother
name
and
capitan
tiago
honor
and
to
prevent
a
public
scandal
but
that
she
will
always
remain
true
to
him
ibarra
escape
had
been
effected
by
elias
who
conveys
him
in
a
banka
up
the
pasig
to
the
lake
where
they
are
so
closely
beset
by
the
civil
guard
that
elias
leaps
into
the
water
and
draws
the
pursuers
away
from
the
boat
in
which
ibarra
lies
concealed
on
christmas
eve
at
the
tomb
of
the
ibarras
in
a
gloomy
wood
elias
appears
wounded
and
dying
to
find
there
a
boy
named
basilio
beside
the
corpse
of
his
mother
a
poor
woman
who
had
been
driven
to
insanity
by
her
husband
neglect
and
abuses
on
the
part
of
the
civil
guard
her
younger
son
having
disappeared
some
time
before
in
the
convento
where
he
was
a
sacristan
basilio
who
is
ignorant
of
elias
identity
helps
him
to
build
a
funeral
pyre
on
which
his
corpse
and
the
madwoman
are
to
be
burned
upon
learning
of
the
reported
death
of
ibarra
in
the
chase
on
the
lake
maria
clara
becomes
disconsolate
and
begs
her
supposed
godfather
fray
damaso
to
put
her
in
a
nunnery
unconscious
of
her
knowledge
of
their
true
relationship
the
friar
breaks
down
and
confesses
that
all
the
trouble
he
has
stirred
up
with
the
ibarras
has
been
to
prevent
her
from
marrying
a
native
which
would
condemn
her
and
her
children
to
the
oppressed
and
enslaved
class
he
finally
yields
to
her
entreaties
and
she
enters
the
nunnery
of
clara
to
which
padre
salvi
is
soon
assigned
in
a
ministerial
capacity
o
masters
lords
and
rulers
in
all
lands
is
this
the
handiwork
you
give
to
god
this
monstrous
thing
distorted
and
how
will
you
ever
straighten
up
this
touch
it
again
with
immortality
give
back
the
upward
looking
and
the
light
rebuild
in
it
the
music
and
the
dream
make
right
the
immemorial
infamies
perfidious
wrongs
immedicable
woes
o
masters
lords
and
rulers
in
all
lands
how
will
the
future
reckon
with
this
man
how
answer
his
brute
question
in
that
hour
when
whirlwinds
of
rebellion
shake
the
world
how
will
it
be
with
kingdoms
and
with
kings
with
those
who
shaped
him
to
the
thing
he
is
when
this
dumb
terror
shall
reply
to
god

chapter
i
on
the
upper
deck
sic
itur
ad
astra
one
morning
in
december
the
steamer
was
laboriously
ascending
the
tortuous
course
of
the
pasig
carrying
a
large
crowd
of
passengers
toward
the
province
of
la
laguna
she
was
a
heavily
built
steamer
almost
round
like
the
from
which
she
derived
her
name
quite
dirty
in
spite
of
her
pretensions
to
whiteness
majestic
and
grave
from
her
leisurely
motion
altogether
she
was
held
in
great
affection
in
that
region
perhaps
from
her
tagalog
name
or
from
the
fact
that
she
bore
the
characteristic
impress
of
things
in
the
country
representing
something
like
a
triumph
over
progress
a
steamer
that
was
not
a
steamer
at
all
an
organism
stolid
imperfect
yet
unimpeachable
which
when
it
wished
to
pose
as
being
rankly
progressive
proudly
contented
itself
with
putting
on
a
fresh
coat
of
paint
indeed
the
happy
steamer
was
genuinely
filipino
if
a
person
were
only
reasonably
considerate
she
might
even
have
been
taken
for
the
ship
of
state
constructed
as
she
had
been
under
the
inspection
of
and
bathed
in
the
sunlight
of
a
morning
that
made
the
waters
of
the
river
sparkle
and
the
breezes
rustle
in
the
bending
bamboo
on
its
banks
there
she
goes
with
her
white
silhouette
throwing
out
great
clouds
of
smoke
the
ship
of
state
so
the
joke
runs
also
has
the
vice
of
smoking
the
whistle
shrieks
at
every
moment
hoarse
and
commanding
like
a
tyrant
who
would
rule
by
shouting
so
that
no
one
on
board
can
hear
his
own
thoughts
she
menaces
everything
she
meets
now
she
looks
as
though
she
would
grind
to
bits
the
insecure
fishing
apparatus
which
in
their
movements
resemble
skeletons
of
giants
saluting
an
antediluvian
tortoise
now
she
speeds
straight
toward
the
clumps
of
bamboo
or
against
the
amphibian
structures
or
wayside
which
amid
and
other
flowers
look
like
indecisive
bathers
who
with
their
feet
already
in
the
water
can
not
bring
themselves
to
make
the
final
plunge
at
times
following
a
sort
of
channel
marked
out
in
the
river
by
she
moves
along
with
a
satisfied
air
except
when
a
sudden
shock
disturbs
the
passengers
and
throws
them
off
their
balance
all
the
result
of
a
collision
with
a
which
no
one
dreamed
was
there
moreover
if
the
comparison
with
the
ship
of
state
is
not
yet
complete
note
the
arrangement
of
the
passengers
on
the
lower
deck
appear
brown
faces
and
black
heads
types
of
indians
chinese
and
mestizos
wedged
in
between
bales
of
merchandise
and
boxes
while
there
on
the
upper
deck
beneath
an
awning
that
protects
them
from
the
sun
are
seated
in
comfortable
chairs
a
few
passengers
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
europeans
friars
and
government
clerks
each
with
his
cigar
and
gazing
at
the
landscape
apparently
without
heeding
the
efforts
of
the
captain
and
the
sailors
to
overcome
the
obstacles
in
the
river
the
captain
was
a
man
of
kindly
aspect
well
along
in
years
an
old
sailor
who
in
his
youth
had
plunged
into
far
vaster
seas
but
who
now
in
his
age
had
to
exercise
much
greater
attention
care
and
vigilance
to
avoid
dangers
of
a
trivial
character
and
they
were
the
same
for
each
day
the
same
the
same
hulk
of
unwieldy
steamer
wedged
into
the
same
curves
like
a
corpulent
dame
in
a
jammed
throng
so
at
each
moment
the
good
man
had
to
stop
to
back
up
to
go
forward
at
half
speed
sending
now
to
port
now
to
starboard
the
five
sailors
equipped
with
long
bamboo
poles
to
give
force
to
the
turn
the
rudder
had
suggested
he
was
like
a
veteran
who
after
leading
men
through
hazardous
campaigns
had
in
his
age
become
the
tutor
of
a
capricious
disobedient
and
lazy
boy
doña
victorina
the
only
lady
seated
in
the
european
group
could
say
whether
the
was
not
lazy
disobedient
and
capricious
doña
victorina
who
nervous
as
ever
was
hurling
invectives
against
the
cascos
bankas
rafts
of
coconuts
the
indians
paddling
about
and
even
the
washerwomen
and
bathers
who
fretted
her
with
their
mirth
and
chatter
yes
the
would
move
along
very
well
if
there
were
no
indians
in
the
river
no
indians
in
the
country
yes
if
there
were
not
a
single
indian
in
the
world
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
helmsmen
were
indians
the
sailors
indians
indians
the
engineers
indians
per
cent
of
the
passengers
and
she
herself
also
an
indian
if
the
rouge
were
scratched
off
and
her
pretentious
gown
removed
that
morning
doña
victorina
was
more
irritated
than
usual
because
the
members
of
the
group
took
very
little
notice
of
her
reason
for
which
was
not
lacking
for
just
consider
there
could
be
found
three
friars
convinced
that
the
world
would
move
backwards
the
very
day
they
should
take
a
single
step
to
the
right
an
indefatigable
don
custodio
who
was
sleeping
peacefully
satisfied
with
his
projects
a
prolific
writer
like
anagram
of
ibañez
who
believed
that
the
people
of
manila
thought
because
he
was
a
thinker
a
canon
like
padre
irene
who
added
luster
to
the
clergy
with
his
rubicund
face
carefully
shaven
from
which
towered
a
beautiful
jewish
nose
and
his
silken
cassock
of
neat
cut
and
small
buttons
and
a
wealthy
jeweler
like
simoun
who
was
reputed
to
be
the
adviser
and
inspirer
of
all
the
acts
of
his
excellency
the
just
consider
the
presence
there
of
these
pillars
quibus
of
the
country
seated
there
in
agreeable
discourse
showing
little
sympathy
for
a
renegade
filipina
who
dyed
her
hair
red
now
was
this
enough
to
exhaust
the
patience
of
a
female
job
a
sobriquet
doña
victorina
always
applied
to
herself
when
put
out
with
any
one
the
of
the
señora
increased
every
time
the
captain
shouted
port
starboard
to
the
sailors
who
then
hastily
seized
their
poles
and
thrust
them
against
the
banks
thus
with
the
strength
of
their
legs
and
shoulders
preventing
the
steamer
from
shoving
its
hull
ashore
at
that
particular
point
seen
under
these
circumstances
the
ship
of
state
might
be
said
to
have
been
converted
from
a
tortoise
into
a
crab
every
time
any
danger
threatened
but
captain
why
do
your
stupid
steersmen
go
in
that
direction
asked
the
lady
with
great
indignation
because
it
very
shallow
in
the
other
señora
answered
the
captain
deliberately
slowly
winking
one
eye
a
little
habit
which
he
had
cultivated
as
if
to
say
to
his
words
on
their
way
out
slowly
slowly
half
speed
botheration
half
speed
protested
doña
victorina
disdainfully
why
not
full
because
we
should
then
be
traveling
over
those
ricefields
señora
replied
the
imperturbable
captain
pursing
his
lips
to
indicate
the
cultivated
fields
and
indulging
in
two
circumspect
winks
this
doña
victorina
was
well
known
in
the
country
for
her
caprices
and
extravagances
she
was
often
seen
in
society
where
she
was
tolerated
whenever
she
appeared
in
the
company
of
her
niece
paulita
gomez
a
very
beautiful
and
wealthy
orphan
to
whom
she
was
a
kind
of
guardian
at
a
rather
advanced
age
she
had
married
a
poor
wretch
named
don
tiburcio
de
espadaña
and
at
the
time
we
now
see
her
carried
upon
herself
fifteen
years
of
wedded
life
false
frizzes
and
a
costume
for
her
whole
ambition
had
been
to
europeanize
herself
with
the
result
that
from
the
day
of
her
wedding
she
had
gradually
thanks
to
her
criminal
attempts
succeeded
in
so
transforming
herself
that
at
the
present
time
quatrefages
and
virchow
together
could
not
have
told
where
to
classify
her
among
the
known
races
her
husband
who
had
borne
all
her
impositions
with
the
resignation
of
a
fakir
through
so
many
years
of
married
life
at
last
on
one
luckless
day
had
had
his
bad
and
administered
to
her
a
superb
whack
with
his
crutch
the
surprise
of
madam
job
at
such
an
inconsistency
of
character
made
her
insensible
to
the
immediate
effects
and
only
after
she
had
recovered
from
her
astonishment
and
her
husband
had
fled
did
she
take
notice
of
the
pain
then
remaining
in
bed
for
several
days
to
the
great
delight
of
paulita
who
was
very
fond
of
joking
and
laughing
at
her
aunt
as
for
her
husband
horrified
at
the
impiety
of
what
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
terrific
parricide
he
took
to
flight
pursued
by
the
matrimonial
furies
two
curs
and
a
parrot
with
all
the
speed
his
lameness
permitted
climbed
into
the
first
carriage
he
encountered
jumped
into
the
first
banka
he
saw
on
the
river
and
a
philippine
ulysses
began
to
wander
from
town
to
town
from
province
to
province
from
island
to
island
pursued
and
persecuted
by
his
bespectacled
calypso
who
bored
every
one
that
had
the
misfortune
to
travel
in
her
company
she
had
received
a
report
of
his
being
in
the
province
of
la
laguna
concealed
in
one
of
the
towns
so
thither
she
was
bound
to
seduce
him
back
with
her
dyed
frizzes
her
fellow
travelers
had
taken
measures
of
defense
by
keeping
up
among
themselves
a
lively
conversation
on
any
topic
whatsoever
at
that
moment
the
windings
and
turnings
of
the
river
led
them
to
talk
about
straightening
the
channel
and
as
a
matter
of
course
about
the
port
works
the
journalist
with
the
countenance
of
a
friar
was
disputing
with
a
young
friar
who
in
turn
had
the
countenance
of
an
artilleryman
both
were
shouting
gesticulating
waving
their
arms
spreading
out
their
hands
stamping
their
feet
talking
of
levels
the
san
mateo
river
of
cascos
of
indians
and
so
on
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
their
listeners
and
the
undisguised
disgust
of
an
elderly
franciscan
remarkably
thin
and
withered
and
a
handsome
dominican
about
whose
lips
flitted
constantly
a
scornful
smile
the
thin
franciscan
understanding
the
dominican
smile
decided
to
intervene
and
stop
the
argument
he
was
undoubtedly
respected
for
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
cut
short
the
speech
of
both
at
the
moment
when
the
was
talking
about
experience
and
the
about
scientists
scientists
do
you
know
what
they
are
asked
the
franciscan
in
a
hollow
voice
scarcely
stirring
in
his
seat
and
making
only
a
faint
gesture
with
his
skinny
hand
here
you
have
in
the
province
a
bridge
constructed
by
a
brother
of
ours
which
was
not
completed
because
the
scientists
relying
on
their
theories
condemned
it
as
weak
and
scarcely
safe
yet
look
it
is
the
bridge
that
has
withstood
all
the
floods
and
earthquakes
that
it
that
very
thing
that
was
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
say
exclaimed
the
thumping
his
fists
down
on
the
arms
of
his
bamboo
chair
that
it
that
bridge
and
the
scientists
that
was
just
what
i
was
going
to
mention
padre
salvi
remained
silent
half
smiling
either
out
of
respect
or
because
he
really
did
not
know
what
to
reply
and
yet
his
was
the
only
thinking
head
in
the
philippines
padre
irene
nodded
his
approval
as
he
rubbed
his
long
nose
padre
salvi
the
thin
and
withered
cleric
appeared
to
be
satisfied
with
such
submissiveness
and
went
on
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
but
this
does
not
mean
that
you
may
not
be
as
near
right
as
padre
camorra
the
the
trouble
is
in
the
lake
the
fact
is
there
is
a
single
decent
lake
in
this
country
interrupted
doña
victorina
highly
indignant
and
getting
ready
for
a
return
to
the
assault
upon
the
citadel
the
besieged
gazed
at
one
another
in
terror
but
with
the
promptitude
of
a
general
the
jeweler
simoun
rushed
in
to
the
rescue
the
remedy
is
very
simple
he
said
in
a
strange
accent
a
mixture
of
english
and
south
american
and
i
really
do
understand
why
it
occurred
to
somebody
all
turned
to
give
him
careful
attention
even
the
dominican
the
jeweler
was
a
tall
meager
nervous
man
very
dark
dressed
in
the
english
fashion
and
wearing
a
pith
helmet
remarkable
about
him
was
his
long
white
hair
contrasted
with
a
sparse
black
beard
indicating
a
mestizo
origin
to
avoid
the
glare
of
the
sun
he
wore
constantly
a
pair
of
enormous
blue
goggles
which
completely
hid
his
eyes
and
a
portion
of
his
cheeks
thus
giving
him
the
aspect
of
a
blind
or
person
he
was
standing
with
his
legs
apart
as
if
to
maintain
his
balance
with
his
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
coat
the
remedy
is
very
simple
he
repeated
and
would
cost
a
cuarto
the
attention
now
redoubled
for
it
was
whispered
in
manila
that
this
man
controlled
the
and
all
saw
the
remedy
in
process
of
execution
even
don
custodio
himself
turned
to
listen
dig
a
canal
straight
from
the
source
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
passing
through
manila
that
is
make
a
new
and
fill
up
the
old
pasig
that
would
save
land
shorten
communication
and
prevent
the
formation
of
sandbars
the
project
left
all
his
hearers
astounded
accustomed
as
they
were
to
palliative
measures
it
a
yankee
plan
observed
to
ingratiate
himself
with
simoun
who
had
spent
a
long
time
in
north
america
all
considered
the
plan
wonderful
and
so
indicated
by
the
movements
of
their
heads
only
don
custodio
the
liberal
don
custodio
owing
to
his
independent
position
and
his
high
offices
thought
it
his
duty
to
attack
a
project
that
did
not
emanate
from
himself
that
was
a
usurpation
he
coughed
stroked
the
ends
of
his
mustache
and
with
a
voice
as
important
as
though
he
were
at
a
formal
session
of
the
ayuntamiento
said
excuse
me
señor
simoun
my
respected
friend
if
i
should
say
that
i
am
not
of
your
opinion
it
would
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
and
might
perhaps
destroy
some
towns
then
destroy
them
rejoined
simoun
coldly
and
the
money
to
pay
the
laborers
do
pay
them
use
the
prisoners
and
convicts
but
there
are
enough
señor
simoun
then
if
there
are
enough
let
all
the
villagers
the
old
men
the
youths
the
boys
work
instead
of
the
fifteen
days
of
obligatory
service
let
them
work
three
four
five
months
for
the
state
with
the
additional
obligation
that
each
one
provide
his
own
food
and
tools
the
startled
don
custodio
turned
his
head
to
see
if
there
was
any
indian
within
but
fortunately
those
nearby
were
rustics
and
the
two
helmsmen
seemed
to
be
very
much
occupied
with
the
windings
of
the
river
but
señor
simoun
do
fool
yourself
don
custodio
continued
simoun
dryly
only
in
this
way
are
great
enterprises
carried
out
with
small
means
thus
were
constructed
the
pyramids
lake
moeris
and
the
colosseum
in
rome
entire
provinces
came
in
from
the
desert
bringing
their
tubers
to
feed
on
old
men
youths
and
boys
labored
in
transporting
stones
hewing
them
and
carrying
them
on
their
shoulders
under
the
direction
of
the
official
lash
and
afterwards
the
survivors
returned
to
their
homes
or
perished
in
the
sands
of
the
desert
then
came
other
provinces
then
others
succeeding
one
another
in
the
work
during
years
thus
the
task
was
finished
and
now
we
admire
them
we
travel
we
go
to
egypt
and
to
home
we
extol
the
pharaohs
and
the
antonines
do
fool
yourself
the
dead
remain
dead
and
might
only
is
considered
right
by
posterity
but
señor
simoun
such
measures
might
provoke
uprisings
objected
don
custodio
rather
uneasy
over
the
turn
the
affair
had
taken
uprisings
ha
ha
did
the
egyptian
people
ever
rebel
i
wonder
did
the
jewish
prisoners
rebel
against
the
pious
titus
man
i
thought
you
were
better
informed
in
history
clearly
simoun
was
either
very
presumptuous
or
disregarded
conventionalities
to
say
to
don
custodio
face
that
he
did
not
know
history
it
was
enough
to
make
any
one
lose
his
temper
so
it
seemed
for
don
custodio
forgot
himself
and
retorted
but
the
fact
is
that
you
not
among
egyptians
or
jews
and
these
people
have
rebelled
more
than
once
added
the
dominican
somewhat
timidly
in
the
times
when
they
were
forced
to
transport
heavy
timbers
for
the
construction
of
ships
if
it
had
been
for
the
clerics
those
times
are
far
away
answered
simoun
with
a
laugh
even
drier
than
usual
these
islands
will
never
again
rebel
no
matter
how
much
work
and
taxes
they
have
have
you
lauded
to
me
padre
salvi
he
added
turning
to
the
franciscan
the
house
and
hospital
at
los
baños
where
his
excellency
is
at
present
padre
salvi
gave
a
nod
and
looked
up
evading
the
question
well
did
you
tell
me
that
both
buildings
were
constructed
by
forcing
the
people
to
work
on
them
under
the
whip
of
a
perhaps
that
wonderful
bridge
was
built
in
the
same
way
now
tell
me
did
these
people
rebel
the
fact
is
they
have
rebelled
before
replied
the
dominican
and
actu
ad
posse
valet
illatio
no
no
nothing
of
the
kind
continued
simoun
starting
down
a
hatchway
to
the
cabin
what
said
is
said
and
you
padre
sibyla
do
talk
either
latin
or
nonsense
what
are
you
friars
good
for
if
the
people
can
rebel
taking
no
notice
of
the
replies
and
protests
simoun
descended
the
small
companionway
that
led
below
repeating
disdainfully
bosh
bosh
padre
sibyla
turned
pale
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
of
the
university
had
ever
been
credited
with
nonsense
don
custodio
turned
green
at
no
meeting
in
which
he
had
ever
found
himself
had
he
encountered
such
an
adversary
an
american
mulatto
he
fumed
a
british
indian
observed
in
a
low
tone
an
american
i
tell
you
and
should
i
know
retorted
don
custodio
in
his
excellency
has
told
me
so
he
a
jeweler
whom
the
latter
knew
in
havana
and
as
i
suspect
the
one
who
got
him
advancement
by
lending
him
money
so
to
repay
him
he
has
had
him
come
here
to
let
him
have
a
chance
and
increase
his
fortune
by
selling
diamonds
imitations
who
knows
and
he
so
ungrateful
that
after
getting
money
from
the
indians
he
wishes
huh
the
sentence
was
concluded
by
a
significant
wave
of
the
hand
no
one
dared
to
join
in
this
diatribe
don
custodio
could
discredit
himself
with
his
excellency
if
he
wished
but
neither
nor
padre
irene
nor
padre
salvi
nor
the
offended
padre
sibyla
had
any
confidence
in
the
discretion
of
the
others
the
fact
is
that
this
man
being
an
american
thinks
no
doubt
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
redskins
to
talk
of
these
matters
on
a
steamer
compel
force
the
people
and
he
the
very
person
who
advised
the
expedition
to
the
carolines
and
the
campaign
in
mindanao
which
is
going
to
bring
us
to
disgraceful
ruin
he
the
one
who
has
offered
to
superintend
the
building
of
the
cruiser
and
i
say
what
does
a
jeweler
no
matter
how
rich
and
learned
he
may
be
know
about
naval
construction
all
this
was
spoken
by
don
custodio
in
a
guttural
tone
to
his
neighbor
while
he
gesticulated
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
from
time
to
time
with
his
looks
consulted
the
others
who
were
nodding
their
heads
ambiguously
the
canon
irene
indulged
in
a
rather
equivocal
smile
which
he
half
hid
with
his
hand
as
he
rubbed
his
nose
i
tell
you
continued
don
custodio
slapping
the
journalist
on
the
arm
all
the
trouble
comes
from
not
consulting
the
here
a
project
in
fine
words
and
especially
with
a
big
appropriation
with
an
appropriation
in
round
numbers
dazzles
meets
with
acceptance
at
once
for
this
here
in
further
explanation
he
rubbed
the
tip
of
his
thumb
against
his
middle
and
forefinger
there
something
in
that
there
something
in
that
thought
it
his
duty
to
remark
since
in
his
capacity
of
journalist
he
had
to
be
informed
about
everything
now
look
here
before
the
port
works
i
presented
a
project
original
simple
useful
economical
and
practicable
for
clearing
away
the
bar
in
the
lake
and
it
has
been
accepted
because
there
was
any
of
that
in
it
he
repeated
the
movement
of
his
fingers
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
gazed
at
the
others
as
though
to
say
have
you
ever
heard
of
such
a
misfortune
may
we
know
what
it
was
asked
several
drawing
nearer
and
giving
him
their
attention
the
projects
of
don
custodio
were
as
renowned
as
quacks
specifics
don
custodio
was
on
the
point
of
refusing
to
explain
it
from
resentment
at
not
having
found
any
supporters
in
his
diatribe
against
simoun
when
there
no
danger
you
want
me
to
talk
eh
and
when
there
is
you
keep
quiet
he
was
going
to
say
but
that
would
cause
the
loss
of
a
good
opportunity
and
his
project
now
that
it
could
not
be
carried
out
might
at
least
be
known
and
admired
after
blowing
out
two
or
three
puffs
of
smoke
coughing
and
spitting
through
a
scupper
he
slapped
on
the
thigh
and
asked
you
seen
ducks
i
rather
think
so
we
hunted
them
on
the
lake
answered
the
surprised
journalist
no
i
not
talking
about
wild
ducks
i
talking
of
the
domestic
ones
of
those
that
are
raised
in
pateros
and
pasig
do
you
know
what
they
feed
on
the
only
thinking
head
did
not
know
he
was
not
engaged
in
that
business
on
snails
man
on
snails
exclaimed
padre
camorra
one
have
to
be
an
indian
to
know
that
it
sufficient
to
have
eyes
exactly
so
on
snails
repeated
don
custodio
flourishing
his
forefinger
and
do
you
know
where
they
get
them
again
the
thinking
head
did
not
know
well
if
you
had
been
in
the
country
as
many
years
as
i
have
you
would
know
that
they
fish
them
out
of
the
bar
itself
where
they
abound
mixed
with
the
sand
then
your
project
well
i
coming
to
that
my
idea
was
to
compel
all
the
towns
round
about
near
the
bar
to
raise
ducks
and
you
see
how
they
all
by
themselves
will
deepen
the
channel
by
fishing
for
the
snails
no
more
and
no
less
no
more
and
no
less
here
don
custodio
extended
his
arms
and
gazed
triumphantly
at
the
stupefaction
of
his
hearers
to
none
of
them
had
occurred
such
an
original
idea
will
you
allow
me
to
write
an
article
about
that
asked
in
this
country
there
is
so
little
thinking
done
but
don
custodio
exclaimed
doña
victorina
with
smirks
and
grimaces
if
everybody
takes
to
raising
ducks
the
eggs
will
become
abundant
ugh
how
nasty
rather
let
the
bar
close
up
entirely

on
the

there

a

from

amid
the
human

the
pestilential
odor

to
be

the
great

of
the
passengers
some
were
silently
gazing
at
the

others
were

bathed
in
their
copious
perspiration
only
a
few
youths
students
for
the
most
part
easily
recognizable
from
their
white
garments
and
their
confident
bearing
made
bold
to
move
about
from
stern
to
bow
leaping
over
baskets
and
boxes
happy
in
the
prospect
of
the
approaching
vacation
now
they
commented
on
the
movements
of
the
engines
endeavoring
to
recall
forgotten
notions
of
physics
now
they
surrounded
the
young
schoolgirl
or
the
with
her
collar
of
whispering
into
their
ears
words
that
made
them
smile
and
cover
their
faces
with
their
fans
nevertheless
two
of
them
instead
of
engaging
in
these
fleeting
gallantries
stood
in
the
bow
talking
with
a
man
advanced
in
years
but
still
vigorous
and
erect
both
these
youths
seemed
to
be
well
known
and
respected
to
judge
from
the
deference
shown
them
by
their
fellow
passengers
the
elder
who
was
dressed
in
complete
black
was
the
medical
student
basilio
famous
for
his
successful
cures
and
extraordinary
treatments
while
the
other
taller
and
more
robust
although
much
younger
was
isagani
one
of
the
poets
or
at
least
rimesters
who
that
year
came
from
the
ateneo
a
curious
character
ordinarily
quite
taciturn
and
uncommunicative
the
man
talking
with
them
was
the
rich
capitan
basilio
who
was
returning
from
a
business
trip
to
manila
capitan
tiago
is
getting
along
about
the
same
as
usual
yes
sir
said
the
student
basilio
shaking
his
head
he
wo
submit
to
any
treatment
at
the
advice
of
certain
he
is
sending
me
to
san
diego
under
the
pretext
of
looking
after
his
property
but
in
reality
so
that
he
may
be
left
to
smoke
his
opium
with
complete
liberty
when
the
student
said
certain
he
really
meant
padre
irene
a
great
friend
and
adviser
of
capitan
tiago
in
his
last
days
opium
is
one
of
the
plagues
of
modern
times
replied
the
capitan
with
the
disdain
and
indignation
of
a
roman
senator
the
ancients
knew
about
it
but
never
abused
it
while
the
addiction
to
classical
studies
lasted
mark
this
well
young
men
opium
was
used
solely
as
a
medicine
and
besides
tell
me
who
smoke
it
the
most
chinamen
chinamen
who
do
understand
a
word
of
latin
ah
if
capitan
tiago
had
only
devoted
himself
to
cicero
here
the
most
classical
disgust
painted
itself
on
his
epicurean
face
isagani
regarded
him
with
attention
that
gentleman
was
suffering
from
nostalgia
for
antiquity
but
to
get
back
to
this
academy
of
castilian
capitan
basilio
continued
i
assure
you
gentlemen
that
you
wo
materialize
it
yes
sir
from
day
to
day
we
expecting
the
permit
replied
isagani
padre
irene
whom
you
may
have
noticed
above
and
to
whom
we
presented
a
team
of
bays
has
promised
it
to
us
he
on
his
way
now
to
confer
with
the
general
that
does
matter
padre
sibyla
is
opposed
to
it
let
him
oppose
it
that
why
he
here
on
the
steamer
in
order
to
at
los
baños
before
the
general
and
the
student
basilio
filled
out
his
meaning
by
going
through
the
pantomime
of
striking
his
fists
together
that
understood
observed
capitan
basilio
smiling
but
even
though
you
get
the
permit
where
you
get
the
funds
we
have
them
sir
each
student
has
contributed
a
real
but
what
about
the
professors
we
have
them
half
filipinos
and
half
peninsulars
and
the
house
makaraig
the
wealthy
makaraig
has
offered
one
of
his
capitan
basilio
had
to
give
in
these
young
men
had
everything
arranged
for
the
rest
he
said
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
it
not
altogether
bad
it
not
a
bad
idea
and
now
that
you
ca
know
latin
at
least
you
may
know
castilian
here
you
have
another
instance
namesake
of
how
we
are
going
backwards
in
our
times
we
learned
latin
because
our
books
were
in
latin
now
you
study
latin
a
little
but
have
no
latin
books
on
the
other
hand
your
books
are
in
castilian
and
that
language
is
not
taught
parentum
pejor
avis
tulit
nos
nequiores
as
horace
said
with
this
quotation
he
moved
away
majestically
like
a
roman
emperor
the
youths
smiled
at
each
other
these
men
of
the
past
remarked
isagani
find
obstacles
for
everything
propose
a
thing
to
them
and
instead
of
seeing
its
advantages
they
only
fix
their
attention
on
the
difficulties
they
want
everything
to
come
smooth
and
round
as
a
billiard
ball
he
right
at
home
with
your
uncle
observed
basilio
they
talk
of
past
times
but
listen
speaking
of
uncles
what
does
yours
say
about
paulita
isagani
blushed
he
preached
me
a
sermon
about
the
choosing
of
a
wife
i
answered
him
that
there
was
in
manila
another
like
her
beautiful
an
orphan
very
wealthy
elegant
charming
with
no
defect
other
than
a
ridiculous
aunt
added
basilio
at
which
both
smiled
in
regard
to
the
aunt
do
you
know
that
she
has
charged
me
to
look
for
her
husband
doña
victorina
and
you
promised
in
order
to
keep
your
sweetheart
naturally
but
the
fact
is
that
her
husband
is
actually
hidden
in
my
uncle
house
both
burst
into
a
laugh
at
this
while
isagani
continued
why
my
uncle
being
a
conscientious
man
wo
go
on
the
upper
deck
fearful
that
doña
victorina
will
ask
him
about
don
tiburcio
just
imagine
when
doña
victorina
learned
that
i
was
a
steerage
passenger
she
gazed
at
me
with
a
disdain
that
at
that
moment
simoun
came
down
and
catching
sight
of
the
two
young
men
greeted
basilio
in
a
patronizing
tone
hello
don
basilio
you
off
for
the
vacation
is
the
gentleman
a
townsman
of
yours
basilio
introduced
isagani
with
the
remark
that
he
was
not
a
townsman
but
that
their
homes
were
not
very
far
apart
isagani
lived
on
the
seashore
of
the
opposite
coast
simoun
examined
him
with
such
marked
attention
that
he
was
annoyed
turned
squarely
around
and
faced
the
jeweler
with
a
provoking
stare
well
what
is
the
province
like
the
latter
asked
turning
again
to
basilio
why
are
you
familiar
with
it
how
the
devil
am
i
to
know
it
when
i
never
set
foot
in
it
been
told
that
it
very
poor
and
does
buy
jewels
we
do
buy
jewels
because
we
do
need
them
rejoined
isagani
dryly
piqued
in
his
provincial
pride
a
smile
played
over
simoun
pallid
lips
do
be
offended
young
man
he
replied
i
had
no
bad
intentions
but
as
i
been
assured
that
nearly
all
the
money
is
in
the
hands
of
the
native
priests
i
said
to
myself
the
friars
are
dying
for
curacies
and
the
franciscans
are
satisfied
with
the
poorest
so
when
they
give
them
up
to
the
native
priests
the
truth
must
be
that
the
king
profile
is
unknown
there
but
enough
of
that
come
and
have
a
beer
with
me
and
drink
to
the
prosperity
of
your
province
the
youths
thanked
him
but
declined
the
offer
you
do
wrong
simoun
said
to
them
visibly
taken
aback
beer
is
a
good
thing
and
i
heard
padre
camorra
say
this
morning
that
the
lack
of
energy
noticeable
in
this
country
is
due
to
the
great
amount
of
water
the
inhabitants
drink
isagani
was
almost
as
tall
as
the
jeweler
and
at
this
he
drew
himself
up
then
tell
padre
camorra
basilio
hastened
to
say
while
he
nudged
isagani
slyly
tell
him
that
if
he
would
drink
water
instead
of
wine
or
beer
perhaps
we
might
all
be
the
gainers
and
he
would
not
give
rise
to
so
much
talk
and
tell
him
also
added
isagani
paying
no
attention
to
his
friend
nudges
that
water
is
very
mild
and
can
be
drunk
but
that
it
drowns
out
the
wine
and
beer
and
puts
out
the
fire
that
heated
it
becomes
steam
and
that
ruffled
it
is
the
ocean
that
it
once
destroyed
mankind
and
made
the
earth
tremble
to
its
foundations
simoun
raised
his
head
although
his
looks
could
not
be
read
through
the
blue
goggles
on
the
rest
of
his
face
surprise
might
be
seen
rather
a
good
answer
he
said
but
i
fear
that
he
might
get
facetious
and
ask
me
when
the
water
will
be
converted
into
steam
and
when
into
an
ocean
padre
camorra
is
rather
incredulous
and
is
a
great
wag
when
the
fire
heats
it
when
the
rivulets
that
are
now
scattered
through
the
steep
valleys
forced
by
fatality
rush
together
in
the
abyss
that
men
are
digging
replied
isagani
no
señor
simoun
interposed
basilio
changing
to
a
jesting
tone
rather
keep
in
mind
the
verses
of
my
friend
isagani
himself
you
you
say
and
water
we
then
as
you
wish
so
let
it
be
but
let
us
live
in
peace
and
right
nor
shall
the
fire
see
us
fight
so
joined
by
wisdom
glowing
flame
that
without
anger
hate
or
blame
we
form
the
steam
the
fifth
element
progress
and
light
life
and
movement
utopia
utopia
responded
simoun
dryly
the
engine
is
about
to
meet
in
the
meantime
i
drink
my
beer
so
without
any
word
of
excuse
he
left
the
two
friends
but
what
the
matter
with
you
today
that
you
so
quarrelsome
asked
basilio
nothing
i
do
know
why
but
that
man
fills
me
with
horror
fear
almost
i
was
nudging
you
with
my
elbow
do
you
know
that
he
called
the
brown
cardinal
the
brown
cardinal
or
black
eminence
as
you
wish
i
do
understand
richelieu
had
a
capuchin
adviser
who
was
called
the
gray
eminence
well
that
what
this
man
is
to
the
general
really
that
what
i
heard
from
certain
person
who
always
speaks
ill
of
him
behind
his
back
and
flatters
him
to
his
face
does
he
also
visit
capitan
tiago
from
the
first
day
after
his
arrival
and
i
sure
that
certain
looks
upon
him
as
a
rival
in
the
inheritance
i
believe
that
he
going
to
see
the
general
about
the
question
of
instruction
in
castilian
at
that
moment
isagani
was
called
away
by
a
servant
to
his
uncle
on
one
of
the
benches
at
the
stern
huddled
in
among
the
other
passengers
sat
a
native
priest
gazing
at
the
landscapes
that
were
successively
unfolded
to
his
view
his
neighbors
made
room
for
him
the
men
on
passing
taking
off
their
hats
and
the
gamblers
not
daring
to
set
their
table
near
where
he
was
he
said
little
but
neither
smoked
nor
assumed
arrogant
airs
nor
did
he
disdain
to
mingle
with
the
other
men
returning
the
salutes
with
courtesy
and
affability
as
if
he
felt
much
honored
and
very
grateful
although
advanced
in
years
with
hair
almost
completely
gray
he
appeared
to
be
in
vigorous
health
and
even
when
seated
held
his
body
straight
and
his
head
erect
but
without
pride
or
arrogance
he
differed
from
the
ordinary
native
priests
few
enough
indeed
who
at
that
period
served
merely
as
coadjutors
or
administered
some
curacies
temporarily
in
a
certain
and
gravity
like
one
who
was
conscious
of
his
personal
dignity
and
the
sacredness
of
his
office
a
superficial
examination
of
his
appearance
if
not
his
white
hair
revealed
at
once
that
he
belonged
to
another
epoch
another
generation
when
the
better
young
men
were
not
afraid
to
risk
their
dignity
by
becoming
priests
when
the
native
clergy
looked
any
friar
at
all
in
the
face
and
when
their
class
not
yet
degraded
and
vilified
called
for
free
men
and
not
slaves
superior
intelligences
and
not
servile
wills
in
his
sad
and
serious
features
was
to
be
read
the
serenity
of
a
soul
fortified
by
study
and
meditation
perhaps
tried
out
by
deep
moral
suffering
this
priest
was
padre
florentino
isagani
uncle
and
his
story
is
easily
told
scion
of
a
wealthy
and
influential
family
of
manila
of
agreeable
appearance
and
cheerful
disposition
suited
to
shine
in
the
world
he
had
never
felt
any
call
to
the
sacerdotal
profession
but
by
reason
of
some
promises
or
vows
his
mother
after
not
a
few
struggles
and
violent
disputes
compelled
him
to
enter
the
seminary
she
was
a
great
friend
of
the
archbishop
had
a
will
of
iron
and
was
as
inexorable
as
is
every
devout
woman
who
believes
that
she
is
interpreting
the
will
of
god
vainly
the
young
florentine
offered
resistance
vainly
he
begged
vainly
he
pleaded
his
love
affairs
even
provoking
scandals
priest
he
had
to
become
at
years
of
age
and
priest
he
became
the
archbishop
ordained
him
his
first
mass
was
celebrated
with
great
pomp
three
days
were
given
over
to
feasting
and
his
mother
died
happy
and
content
leaving
him
all
her
fortune
but
in
that
struggle
florentine
received
a
wound
from
which
he
never
recovered
weeks
before
his
first
mass
the
woman
he
loved
in
desperation
married
a
nobody
a
blow
the
rudest
he
had
ever
experienced
he
lost
his
moral
energy
life
became
dull
and
insupportable
if
not
his
virtue
and
the
respect
for
his
office
that
unfortunate
love
affair
saved
him
from
the
depths
into
which
the
regular
orders
and
secular
clergymen
both
fall
in
the
philippines
he
devoted
himself
to
his
parishioners
as
a
duty
and
by
inclination
to
the
natural
sciences
when
the
events
of
occurred
he
feared
that
the
large
income
his
curacy
yielded
him
would
attract
attention
to
him
so
desiring
peace
above
everything
he
sought
and
secured
his
release
living
thereafter
as
a
private
individual
on
his
patrimonial
estate
situated
on
the
pacific
coast
he
there
adopted
his
nephew
isagani
who
was
reported
by
the
malicious
to
be
his
own
son
by
his
old
sweetheart
when
she
became
a
widow
and
by
the
more
serious
and
better
informed
the
natural
child
of
a
cousin
a
lady
in
manila
the
captain
of
the
steamer
caught
sight
of
the
old
priest
and
insisted
that
he
go
to
the
upper
deck
saying
if
you
do
do
so
the
friars
will
think
that
you
do
want
to
associate
with
them
padre
florentino
had
no
recourse
but
to
accept
so
he
summoned
his
nephew
in
order
to
let
him
know
where
he
was
going
and
to
charge
him
not
to
come
near
the
upper
deck
while
he
was
there
if
the
captain
notices
you
he
invite
you
also
and
we
should
then
be
abusing
his
kindness
my
uncle
way
thought
isagani
all
so
that
i
wo
have
any
reason
for
talking
with
doña
victorina

so
traurig

when
padre
florentino
joined
the
group
above
the
bad
humor
provoked
by
the
previous
discussion
had
entirely
disappeared
perhaps
their
spirits
had
been
raised
by
the
attractive
houses
of
the
town
of
pasig
or
the
glasses
of
sherry
they
had
drunk
in
preparation
for
the
coming
meal
or
the
prospect
of
a
good
breakfast
whatever
the
cause
the
fact
was
that
they
were
all
laughing
and
joking
even
including
the
lean
franciscan
although
he
made
little
noise
and
his
smiles
looked
like

prettiest
part
of
the
trip
pshaw
retorted
simoun
as
he
ascended
i
seen
so
many
rivers
and
landscapes
that
i
only
interested
in
those
that
call
up
legends
as
for
legends
the
pasig
has
a
few
observed
the
captain
who
did
not
relish
any
depreciation
of
the
river
where
he
navigated
and
earned
his
livelihood
here
you
have
that
of
a
rock
sacred
before
the
coming
of
the
spaniards
as
the
abode
of
spirits
afterwards
when
the
superstition
had
been
dissipated
and
the
rock
profaned
it
was
converted
into
a
nest
of
tulisanes
since
from
its
crest
they
easily
captured
the
luckless
bankas
which
had
to
contend
against
both
the
currents
and
men
later
in
our
time
in
spite
of
human
interference
there
are
still
told
stories
about
wrecked
bankas
and
if
on
rounding
it
i
did
steer
with
my
six
senses
i
be
smashed
against
its
sides
then
you
have
another
legend
that
of
doña
jeronima
cave
which
padre
florentino
can
relate
to
you
everybody
knows
that
remarked
padre
sibyla
disdainfully
but
neither
simoun
nor
nor
padre
irene
nor
padre
camorra
knew
it
so
they
begged
for
the
story
some
in
jest
and
others
from
genuine
curiosity
the
priest
adopting
the
tone
of
burlesque
with
which
some
had
made
their
request
began
like
an
old
tutor
relating
a
story
to
children
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
student
who
had
made
a
promise
of
marriage
to
a
young
woman
in
his
country
but
it
seems
that
he
failed
to
remember
her
she
waited
for
him
faithfully
year
after
year
her
youth
passed
she
grew
into
middle
age
and
then
one
day
she
heard
a
report
that
her
old
sweetheart
was
the
archbishop
of
manila
disguising
herself
as
a
man
she
came
round
the
cape
and
presented
herself
before
his
grace
demanding
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
what
she
asked
was
of
course
impossible
so
the
archbishop
ordered
the
preparation
of
the
cave
that
you
may
have
noticed
with
its
entrance
covered
and
decorated
with
a
curtain
of
vines
there
she
lived
and
died
and
there
she
is
buried
the
legend
states
that
doña
jeronima
was
so
fat
that
she
had
to
turn
sidewise
to
get
into
it
her
fame
as
an
enchantress
sprung
from
her
custom
of
throwing
into
the
river
the
silver
dishes
which
she
used
in
the
sumptuous
banquets
that
were
attended
by
crowds
of
gentlemen
a
net
was
spread
under
the
water
to
hold
the
dishes
and
thus
they
were
cleaned
it
has
been
twenty
years
since
the
river
washed
the
very
entrance
of
the
cave
but
it
has
gradually
been
receding
just
as
the
memory
of
her
is
dying
out
among
the
people
a
beautiful
legend
exclaimed
i
going
to
write
an
article
about
it
it
sentimental
doña
victorina
thought
of
dwelling
in
such
a
cave
and
was
about
to
say
so
when
simoun
took
the
floor
instead
but
what
your
opinion
about
that
padre
salvi
he
asked
the
franciscan
who
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
thought
does
it
seem
to
you
as
though
his
grace
instead
of
giving
her
a
cave
ought
to
have
placed
her
in
a
nunnery
in
clara
for
example
what
do
you
say
there
was
a
start
of
surprise
on
padre
sibyla
part
to
notice
that
padre
salvi
shuddered
and
looked
askance
at
simoun
because
it
not
a
very
gallant
act
continued
simoun
quite
naturally
to
give
a
rocky
cliff
as
a
home
to
one
with
whose
hopes
we
have
trifled
it
hardly
religious
to
expose
her
thus
to
temptation
in
a
cave
on
the
banks
of
a
river
it
smacks
of
nymphs
and
dryads
it
would
have
been
more
gallant
more
pious
more
romantic
more
in
keeping
with
the
customs
of
this
country
to
shut
her
up
in
clara
like
a
new
eloise
in
order
to
visit
and
console
her
from
time
to
time
i
neither
can
nor
should
pass
judgment
upon
the
conduct
of
archbishops
replied
the
franciscan
sourly
but
you
who
are
the
ecclesiastical
governor
acting
in
the
place
of
our
archbishop
what
would
you
do
if
such
a
case
should
arise
padre
salvi
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
calmly
responded
it
not
worth
while
thinking
about
what
ca
happen
but
speaking
of
legends
do
overlook
the
most
beautiful
since
it
is
the
truest
that
of
the
miracle
of
nicholas
the
ruins
of
whose
church
you
may
have
noticed
i
going
to
relate
it
to
señor
simoun
as
he
probably
heard
it
it
seems
that
formerly
the
river
as
well
as
the
lake
was
infested
with
caymans
so
huge
and
voracious
that
they
attacked
bankas
and
upset
them
with
a
slap
of
the
tail
our
chronicles
relate
that
one
day
an
infidel
chinaman
who
up
to
that
time
had
refused
to
be
converted
was
passing
in
front
of
the
church
when
suddenly
the
devil
presented
himself
to
him
in
the
form
of
a
cayman
and
upset
the
banka
in
order
to
devour
him
and
carry
him
off
to
hell
inspired
by
god
the
chinaman
at
that
moment
called
upon
nicholas
and
instantly
the
cayman
was
changed
into
a
stone
the
old
people
say
that
in
their
time
the
monster
could
easily
be
recognized
in
the
pieces
of
stone
that
were
left
and
for
my
part
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
clearly
made
out
the
head
to
judge
from
which
the
monster
must
have
been
enormously
large
marvelous
a
marvelous
legend
exclaimed
it
good
for
an
article
the
description
of
the
monster
the
terror
of
the
chinaman
the
waters
of
the
river
the
bamboo
brakes
also
it
do
for
a
study
of
comparative
religions
because
look
you
an
infidel
chinaman
in
great
distress
invoked
exactly
the
saint
that
he
must
know
only
by
hearsay
and
in
whom
he
did
not
believe
here
there
no
room
for
the
proverb
that
known
evil
is
preferable
to
an
unknown
good
if
i
should
find
myself
in
china
and
get
caught
in
such
a
difficulty
i
would
invoke
the
obscurest
saint
in
the
calendar
before
confucius
or
buddha
whether
this
is
due
to
the
manifest
superiority
of
catholicism
or
to
the
inconsequential
and
illogical
inconsistency
in
the
brains
of
the
yellow
race
a
profound
study
of
anthropology
alone
will
be
able
to
elucidate
had
adopted
the
tone
of
a
lecturer
and
was
describing
circles
in
the
air
with
his
forefinger
priding
himself
on
his
imagination
which
from
the
most
insignificant
facts
could
deduce
so
many
applications
and
inferences
but
noticing
that
simoun
was
preoccupied
and
thinking
that
he
was
pondering
over
what
he
had
just
said
he
inquired
what
the
jeweler
was
meditating
about
about
two
very
important
questions
answered
simoun
two
questions
that
you
might
add
to
your
article
first
what
may
have
become
of
the
devil
on
seeing
himself
suddenly
confined
within
a
stone
did
he
escape
did
he
stay
there
was
he
crushed
second
if
the
petrified
animals
that
i
have
seen
in
various
european
museums
may
not
have
been
the
victims
of
some
antediluvian
saint
the
tone
in
which
the
jeweler
spoke
was
so
serious
while
he
rested
his
forehead
on
the
tip
of
his
forefinger
in
an
attitude
of
deep
meditation
that
padre
camorra
responded
very
gravely
who
knows
who
knows
since
we
busy
with
legends
and
are
now
entering
the
lake
remarked
padre
sibyla
the
captain
must
know
many
at
that
moment
the
steamer
crossed
the
bar
and
the
panorama
spread
out
before
their
eyes
was
so
truly
magnificent
that
all
were
impressed
in
front
extended
the
beautiful
lake
bordered
by
green
shores
and
blue
mountains
like
a
huge
mirror
framed
in
emeralds
and
sapphires
reflecting
the
sky
in
its
glass
on
the
right
were
spread
out
the
low
shores
forming
bays
with
graceful
curves
and
dim
there
in
the
distance
the
crags
of
sungay
while
in
the
background
rose
makiling
imposing
and
majestic
crowned
with
fleecy
clouds
on
the
left
lay
talim
island
with
its
curious
sweep
of
hills
a
fresh
breeze
rippled
over
the
wide
plain
of
water
by
the
way
captain
said
turning
around
do
you
know
in
what
part
of
the
lake
a
certain
guevara
navarra
or
ibarra
was
killed
the
group
looked
toward
the
captain
with
the
exception
of
simoun
who
had
turned
away
his
head
as
though
to
look
for
something
on
the
shore
ah
yes
exclaimed
doña
victorina
where
captain
did
he
leave
any
tracks
in
the
water
the
good
captain
winked
several
times
an
indication
that
he
was
annoyed
but
reading
the
request
in
the
eyes
of
all
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
bow
and
scanned
the
shore
look
over
there
he
said
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
after
making
sure
that
no
strangers
were
near
according
to
the
officer
who
conducted
the
pursuit
ibarra
upon
finding
himself
surrounded
jumped
out
of
his
banka
there
near
the
kinabutasan
and
swimming
under
water
covered
all
that
distance
of
more
than
two
miles
saluted
by
bullets
every
time
that
he
raised
his
head
to
breathe
over
yonder
is
where
they
lost
track
of
him
and
a
little
farther
on
near
the
shore
they
discovered
something
like
the
color
of
blood
and
now
i
think
of
it
it
just
thirteen
years
day
for
day
since
this
happened
so
that
his
corpse
began
went
to
join
his
father
replied
padre
sibyla
was
he
also
another
filibuster
padre
salvi
that
what
might
be
called
cheap
funerals
padre
camorra
eh
remarked
i
always
said
that
those
who
wo
pay
for
expensive
funerals
are
filibusters
rejoined
the
person
addressed
with
a
merry
laugh
but
what
the
matter
with
you
señor
simoun
inquired
seeing
that
the
jeweler
was
motionless
and
thoughtful
are
you
seasick
an
old
traveler
like
you
on
such
a
drop
of
water
as
this
i
want
to
tell
you

in
the
captain
who
had
come
to
hold
all
those
places
in
great
affection
that
you
ca
call
this
a
drop
of
water
it
larger

any

all
those

those
who
have
read
the
first
part
of
this
story
will
perhaps
remember
an
old
who
lived
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
tandang

still
alive
and
though
his
hair
has
turned
completely
white

good
health

no

hunts
or
cuts
firewood

his
fortunes

and
he
works
only
at
making
brooms
his
son

shares
on
the
lands
of
a
capitalist
but
later
having
become
the
owner
of
two
carabaos
and
several
hundred
pesos
determined
to
work
on
his
own
account
aided
by
his
father
his
wife
and
his
three
children
so
they
cut
down
and
cleared
away
some
thick
woods
which
were
situated
on
the
borders
of
the
town
and
which
they
believed
belonged
to
no
one
during
the
labors
of
cleaning
and
cultivating
the
new
land
the
whole
family
fell
ill
with
malaria
and
the
mother
died
along
with
the
eldest
daughter
lucia
in
the
flower
of
her
age
this
which
was
the
natural
consequence
of
breaking
up
new
soil
infested
with
various
kinds
of
bacteria
they
attributed
to
the
anger
of
the
woodland
spirit
so
they
were
resigned
and
went
on
with
their
labor
believing
him
pacified
but
when
they
began
to
harvest
their
first
crop
a
religious
corporation
which
owned
land
in
the
neighboring
town
laid
claim
to
the
fields
alleging
that
they
fell
within
their
boundaries
and
to
prove
it
they
at
once
started
to
set
up
their
marks
however
the
administrator
of
the
religious
order
left
to
them
for
sake
the
usufruct
of

pay

as
much
opposed

any
one
and
more
submissive
to
the
friars
than
most
people
so
in
order
not
to
smash
a
against
a
as
he
said
for
to
him
the
friars
were
iron
pots
and
he
a
clay
jar
he
had
the
weakness
to
yield
to
their
claim
remembering
that
he
did
not

this

the
first
care
the

took
when

who
desired
it

offered
themselves

thought
at
first
that
the
friar
was
joking
but
the
friar
was
talking
seriously
and
indicated
a
servant
of

to
take
possession
of
the
land
poor

turned
pale

emaciated

his
fingers
to
pull
up
the
roots
that
ran
through
it
exasperated
by
the
threats
of
the
friar
who
tried
to
uphold
his
authority
at
any
cost
in
the
presence
of
the
other
tenants
cabesang
tales
rebelled
and
refused
to
pay
a
single
cuarto
having
ever
before
himself
that
red
mist
saying
that
he
would
give
up
his
fields
to
the
first
man
who
could
irrigate
it
with
blood
drawn
from
his
own
veins
old
selo
on
looking
at
his
son
face
did
not
dare
to
mention
the
cayman
but
tried
to
calm
him
by
talking
of
clay
jars
reminding
him
that
the
winner
in
a
lawsuit
was
left
without
a
shirt
to
his
back
we
shall
all
be
turned
to
clay
father
and
without
shirts
we
were
born
was
the
reply
so
he
resolutely
refused
to
pay
or
to
give
up
a
single
span
of
his
land
unless
the
friars
should
first
prove
the
legality
of
their
claim
by
exhibiting
a
of
some
kind
as
they
had
none
a
lawsuit
followed
and
cabesang
tales
entered
into
it
confiding
that
some
at
least
if
not
all
were
lovers
of
justice
and
respecters
of
the
law
i
serve
and
have
been
serving
the
king
with
my
money
and
my
services
he
said
to
those
who
remonstrated
with
him
i
asking
for
justice
and
he
is
obliged
to
give
it
to
me
drawn
on
by
fatality
and
as
if
he
had
put
into
play
in
the
lawsuit
the
whole
future
of
himself
and
his
children
he
went
on
spending
his
savings
to
pay
lawyers
notaries
and
solicitors
not
to
mention
the
officials
and
clerks
who
exploited
his
ignorance
and
his
needs
he
moved
to
and
fro
between
the
village
and
the
capital
passed
his
days
without
eating
and
his
nights
without
sleeping
while
his
talk
was
always
about
briefs
exhibits
and
appeals
there
was
then
seen
a
struggle
such
as
was
never
before
carried
on
under
the
skies
of
the
philippines
that
of
a
poor
indian
ignorant
and
friendless
confiding
in
the
justness
and
righteousness
of
his
cause
fighting
against
a
powerful
corporation
before
which
justice
bowed
her
head
while
the
judges
let
fall
the
scales
and
surrendered
the
sword
he
fought
as
tenaciously
as
the
ant
which
bites
when
it
knows
that
it
is
going
to
be
crushed
as
does
the
fly
which
looks
into
space
only
through
a
pane
of
glass
yet
the
clay
jar
defying
the
iron
pot
and
smashing
itself
into
a
thousand
pieces
bad
in
it
something
impressive
it
had
the
sublimeness
of
desperation
on
the
days
when
his
journeys
left
him
free
he
patrolled
his
fields
armed
with
a
shotgun
saying
that
the
tulisanes
were
hovering
around
and
he
had
need
of
defending
himself
in
order
not
to
fall
into
their
hands
and
thus
lose
his
lawsuit
as
if
to
improve
his
marksmanship
he
shot
at
birds
and
fruits
even
the
butterflies
with
such
accurate
aim
that
the
did
not
dare
to
go
to
sagpang
without
an
escort
of
while
the
friar
hireling
who
gazed
from
afar
at
the
threatening
figure
of
tales
wandering
over
the
fields
like
a
sentinel
upon
the
walls
was
terror
stricken
and
refused
to
take
the
property
away
from
him
but
the
local
judges
and
those
at
the
capital
warned
by
the
experience
of
one
of
their
number
who
had
been
summarily
dismissed
dared
not
give
him
the
decision
fearing
their
own
dismissal
yet
they
were
not
really
bad
men
those
judges
they
were
upright
and
conscientious
good
citizens
excellent
fathers
dutiful
sons
and
they
were
able
to
appreciate
poor
tales
situation
better
than
tales
himself
could
many
of
them
were
versed
in
the
scientific
and
historical
basis
of
property
they
knew
that
the
friars
by
their
own
statutes
could
not
own
property
but
they
also
knew
that
to
come
from
far
across
the
sea
with
an
appointment
secured
with
great
difficulty
to
undertake
the
duties
of
the
position
with
the
best
intentions
and
now
to
lose
it
because
an
indian
fancied
that
justice
had
to
be
done
on
earth
as
in
heaven
that
surely
was
an
idea
they
had
their
families
and
greater
needs
surely
than
that
indian
one
had
a
mother
to
provide
for
and
what
duty
is
more
sacred
than
that
of
caring
for
a
mother
another
had
sisters
all
of
marriageable
age
that
other
there
had
many
little
children
who
expected
their
daily
bread
and
who
like
fledglings
in
a
nest
would
surely
die
of
hunger
the
day
he
was
out
of
a
job
even
the
very
least
of
them
had
there
far
away
a
wife
who
would
be
in
distress
if
the
monthly
remittance
failed
all
these
moral
and
conscientious
judges
tried
everything
in
their
power
in
the
way
of
counsel
advising
cabesang
tales
to
pay
the
rent
demanded
but
tales
like
all
simple
souls
once
he
had
seen
what
was
just
went
straight
toward
it
he
demanded
proofs
documents
papers
but
the
friars
had
none
of
these
resting
their
case
on
his
concessions
in
the
past
cabesang
tales
constant
reply
was
if
every
day
i
give
alms
to
a
beggar
to
escape
annoyance
who
will
oblige
me
to
continue
my
gifts
if
he
abuses
my
generosity
from
this
stand
no
one
could
draw
him
nor
were
there
any
threats
that
could
intimidate
him
in
vain
governor
m
made
a
trip
expressly
to
talk
to
him
and
frighten
him
his
reply
to
it
all
was
you
may
do
what
you
like
mr
governor
i
ignorant
and
powerless
but
cultivated
those
fields
my
wife
and
daughter
died
while
helping
me
clear
them
and
i
wo
give
them
up
to
any
one
but
him
who
can
do
more
with
them
than
i
done
let
him
first
irrigate
them
with
his
blood
and
bury
in
them
his
wife
and
daughter
the
upshot
of
this
obstinacy
was
that
the
honorable
judges
gave
the
decision
to
the
friars
and
everybody
laughed
at
him
saying
that
lawsuits
are
not
won
by
justice
but
cabesang
tales
appealed
loaded
his
shotgun
and
patrolled
his
fields
with
deliberation
during
this
period
his
life
seemed
to
be
a
wild
dream
his
son
tano
a
youth
as
tall
as
his
father
and
as
good
as
his
sister
was
conscripted
but
he
let
the
boy
go
rather
than
purchase
a
substitute
i
have
to
pay
the
lawyers
he
told
his
weeping
daughter
if
i
win
the
case
i
find
a
way
to
get
him
back
and
if
i
lose
it
i
have
any
need
for
sons
so
the
son
went
away
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
him
except
that
his
hair
had
been
cropped
and
that
he
slept
under
a
cart
six
months
later
it
was
rumored
that
he
had
been
seen
embarking
for
the
carolines
another
report
was
that
he
had
been
seen
in
the
uniform
of
the
civil
guard
tano
in
the
civil
guard
exclaimed
several
clasping
their
hands
tano
who
was
so
good
and
so
honest
the
grandfather
went
many
days
without
speaking
to
the
father
juli
fell
sick
but
cabesang
tales
did
not
shed
a
single
tear
although
for
two
days
he
never
left
the
house
as
if
he
feared
the
looks
of
reproach
from
the
whole
village
or
that
he
would
be
called
the
executioner
of
his
son
but
on
the
third
day
he
again
sallied
forth
with
his
shotgun
murderous
intentions
were
attributed
to
him
and
there
were
persons
who
whispered
about
that
he
had
been
heard
to
threaten
that
he
would
bury
the
in
the
furrows
of
his
fields
whereat
the
friar
was
frightened
at
him
in
earnest
as
a
result
of
this
there
came
a
decree
from
the
forbidding
the
use
of
firearms
and
ordering
that
they
be
taken
up
cabesang
tales
had
to
hand
over
his
shotgun
but
he
continued
his
rounds
armed
with
a
long
bolo
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
bolo
when
the
tulisanes
have
firearms
old
selo
asked
him
i
must
watch
my
crops
was
the
answer
every
stalk
of
cane
growing
there
is
one
of
my
wife
bones
the
bolo
was
taken
up
on
the
pretext
that
it
was
too
long
he
then
took
his
father
old
ax
and
with
it
on
his
shoulder
continued
his
sullen
rounds
every
time
he
left
the
house
tandang
selo
and
juli
trembled
for
his
life
the
latter
would
get
up
from
her
loom
go
to
the
window
pray
make
vows
to
the
saints
and
recite
novenas
the
grandfather
was
at
times
unable
to
finish
the
handle
of
a
broom
and
talked
of
returning
to
the
forest
life
in
that
house
was
unbearable
at
last
their
fears
were
realized
as
the
fields
were
some
distance
from
the
village
cabesang
tales
in
spite
of
his
ax
fell
into
the
hands
of
tulisanes
who
had
revolvers
and
rifles
they
told
him
that
since
he
had
money
to
pay
judges
and
lawyers
he
must
have
some
also
for
the
outcasts
and
the
hunted
they
therefore
demanded
a
ransom
of
five
hundred
pesos
through
the
medium
of
a
rustic
with
the
warning
that
if
anything
happened
to
their
messenger
the
captive
would
pay
for
it
with
his
life
two
days
of
grace
were
allowed
this
news
threw
the
poor
family
into
the
wildest
terror
which
was
augmented
when
they
learned
that
the
civil
guard
was
going
out
in
pursuit
of
the
bandits
in
case
of
an
encounter
the
first
victim
would
be
the
captive
this
they
all
knew
the
old
man
was
paralyzed
while
the
pale
and
frightened
daughter
tried
often
to
talk
but
could
not
still
another
thought
more
terrible
an
idea
more
cruel
roused
them
from
their
stupor
the
rustic
sent
by
the
tulisanes
said
that
the
band
would
probably
have
to
move
on
and
if
they
were
slow
in
sending
the
ransom
the
two
days
would
elapse
and
cabesang
tales
would
have
his
throat
cut
this
drove
those
two
beings
to
madness
weak
and
powerless
as
they
were
tandang
selo
got
up
sat
down
went
outside
came
back
again
knowing
not
where
to
go
where
to
seek
aid
juli
appealed
to
her
images
counted
and
recounted
her
money
but
her
two
hundred
pesos
did
not
increase
or
multiply
soon
she
dressed
herself
gathered
together
all
her
jewels
and
asked
the
advice
of
her
grandfather
if
she
should
go
to
see
the
gobernadorcillo
the
judge
the
notary
the
lieutenant
of
the
civil
guard
the
old
man
said
yes
to
everything
or
when
she
said
no
he
too
said
no
at
length
came
the
neighbors
their
relatives
and
friends
some
poorer
than
others
in
their
simplicity
magnifying
the
fears
the
most
active
of
all
was
sister
bali
a
great
who
had
been
to
manila
to
practise
religious
exercises
in
the
nunnery
of
the
sodality
juli
was
willing
to
sell
all
her
jewels
except
a
locket
set
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
which
basilio
had
given
her
for
this
locket
had
a
history
a
nun
the
daughter
of
capitan
tiago
had
given
it
to
a
leper
who
in
return
for
professional
treatment
had
made
a
present
of
it
to
basilio
so
she
could
not
sell
it
without
first
consulting
him
quickly
the
and
earrings
were
sold
as
well
as
rosary
to
their
richest
neighbor
and
thus
fifty
pesos
were
added
but
two
hundred
and
fifty
were
still
lacking
the
locket
might
be
pawned
but
juli
shook
her
head
a
neighbor
suggested
that
the
house
be
sold
and
tandang
selo
approved
the
idea
satisfied
to
return
to
the
forest
and
cut
firewood
as
of
old
but
sister
bali
observed
that
this
could
not
be
done
because
the
owner
was
not
present
the
judge
wife
once
sold
me
her
for
a
peso
but
her
husband
said
that
the
sale
did
not
hold
because
it
had
received
his
approval
he
took
back
the
and
she
has
returned
the
peso
yet
but
i
do
pay
her
when
she
wins
at
abá
in
that
way
i
collected
twelve
cuartos
and
for
that
alone
going
to
play
with
her
i
ca
bear
to
have
people
fail
to
pay
what
they
owe
me
another
neighbor
was
going
to
ask
sister
bali
why
then
did
not
she
settle
a
little
account
with
her
but
the
quick
suspected
this
and
added
at
once
do
you
know
juli
what
you
can
do
borrow
two
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
on
the
house
payable
when
the
lawsuit
is
won
this
seemed
to
be
the
best
proposition
so
they
decided
to
act
upon
it
that
same
day
sister
bali
offered
to
accompany
her
and
together
they
visited
the
houses
of
all
the
rich
folks
in
tiani
but
no
one
would
accept
the
proposal
the
case
they
said
was
already
lost
and
to
show
favors
to
an
enemy
of
the
friars
was
to
expose
themselves
to
their
vengeance
at
last
a
pious
woman
took
pity
on
the
girl
and
lent
the
money
on
condition
that
juli
should
remain
with
her
as
a
servant
until
the
debt
was
paid
juli
would
not
have
so
very
much
to
do
sew
pray
accompany
her
to
mass
and
fast
for
her
now
and
then
the
girl
accepted
with
tears
in
her
eyes
received
the
money
and
promised
to
enter
her
service
on
the
following
day
christmas
when
the
grandfather
heard
of
that
sale
he
fell
to
weeping
like
a
child
what
that
granddaughter
whom
he
had
not
allowed
to
walk
in
the
sun
lest
her
skin
should
be
burned
juli
she
of
the
delicate
fingers
and
rosy
feet
what
that
girl
the
prettiest
in
the
village
and
perhaps
in
the
whole
town
before
whose
window
many
gallants
had
vainly
passed
the
night
playing
and
singing
what
his
only
granddaughter
the
sole
joy
of
his
fading
eyes
she
whom
he
had
dreamed
of
seeing
dressed
in
a
long
skirt
talking
spanish
and
holding
herself
erect
waving
a
painted
fan
like
the
daughters
of
the
wealthy
she
to
become
a
servant
to
be
scolded
and
reprimanded
to
ruin
her
fingers
to
sleep
anywhere
to
rise
in
any
manner
whatsoever
so
the
old
grandfather
wept
and
talked
of
hanging
or
starving
himself
to
death
if
you
go
he
declared
i
going
back
to
the
forest
and
will
never
set
foot
in
the
town
juli
soothed
him
by
saying
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
father
to
return
that
the
suit
would
be
won
and
they
could
then
ransom
her
from
her
servitude
the
night
was
a
sad
one
neither
of
the
two
could
taste
a
bite
and
the
old
man
refused
to
lie
down
passing
the
whole
night
seated
in
a
corner
silent
and
motionless
juli
on
her
part
tried
to
sleep
but
for
a
long
time
could
not
close
her
eyes
somewhat
relieved
about
her
father
fate
she
now
thought
of
herself
and
fell
to
weeping
but
stifled
her
sobs
so
that
the
old
man
might
not
hear
them
the
next
day
she
would
be
a
servant
and
it
was
the
very
day
basilio
was
accustomed
to
come
from
manila
with
presents
for
her
henceforward
she
would
have
to
give
up
that
love
basilio
who
was
going
to
be
a
doctor
could
marry
a
pauper
in
fancy
she
saw
him
going
to
the
church
in
company
with
the
prettiest
and
richest
girl
in
the
town
both
happy
and
smiling
while
she
juli
followed
her
mistress
carrying
novenas
buyos
and
the
cuspidor
here
the
girl
felt
a
lump
rise
in
her
throat
a
sinking
at
her
heart
and
begged
the
virgin
to
let
her
die
first
but
said
her
conscience
he
will
at
least
know
that
i
preferred
to
pawn
myself
rather
than
the
locket
he
gave
me
this
thought
consoled
her
a
little
and
brought
on
empty
dreams
who
knows
but
that
a
miracle
might
happen
she
might
find
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
under
the
image
of
the
virgin
she
had
read
of
many
similar
miracles
the
sun
might
not
rise
nor
morning
come
and
meanwhile
the
suit
would
be
won
her
father
might
return
or
basilio
put
in
his
appearance
she
might
find
a
bag
of
gold
in
the
garden
the
tulisanes
would
send
the
bag
of

the
curate
padre
camorra
who
was
always
teasing
her
would
come
with
the
tulisanes
so
her
ideas
became
more
and
more
confused
until
at
length
worn
out
by
fatigue
and
sorrow
she
went
to
sleep
with
dreams
of
her
childhood
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
she
was
bathing
in
the
torrent
along
with
her
two
brothers
there
were
little
fishes
of
all
colors
that
let
themselves
be
caught
like
fools
and
she
became
impatient
because
she
found
no
pleasure
in
catchnig
such
foolish
little
fishes
basilio
was
under
the
water
but
basilio
for
some
reason
had
the
face
of
her

her
new
mistress
was
watching

from

bank
chapter
v
a
cochero
christmas
eve
basilio
reached
san
diego
just
as
the
christmas
eve
procession
was
passing
through
the
streets
he
had
been
delayed
on
the
road
for
several
hours
because
the
cochero
having
forgotten
his
cedula
was
held
up
by
the
civil
guard
had
his
memory
jogged
by
a
few
blows
from
a
and
afterwards
was
taken
before
the
commandant
now
the
carromata
was
again
detained
to
let
the
procession
pass
while
the
abused
cochero
took
off
his
hat
reverently
and
recited
a
paternoster
to
the
first
image
that
came
along
which
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
great
saint
it
was
the
figure
of
an
old
man
with
an
exceptionally
long
beard
seated
at
the
edge
of
a
grave
under
a
tree
filled
with
all
kinds
of
stuffed
birds
a
with
a
clay
jar
a
mortar
and
a
for
mashing
buyo
were
his
only
utensils
as
if
to
indicate
that
he
lived
on
the
border
of
the
tomb
and
was
doing
his
cooking
there
this
was
the
methuselah
of
the
religious
iconography
of
the
philippines
his
colleague
and
perhaps
contemporary
is
called
in
europe
santa
claus
and
is
still
more
smiling
and
agreeable
in
the
time
of
the
saints
thought
the
cochero
surely
there
were
no
because
one
ca
live
long
on
blows
from
behind
the
great
old
man
came
the
three
magian
kings
on
ponies
that
were
capering
about
especially
that
of
the
negro
melchior
which
seemed
to
be
about
to
trample
its
companions
no
there
could
have
been
any
decided
the
cochero
secretly
envying
those
fortunate
times
because
if
there
had
been
that
negro
who
is
cutting
up
such
capers
beside
those
two
spaniards
gaspar
and
bathazar
would
have
gone
to
jail
then
observing
that
the
negro
wore
a
crown
and
was
a
king
like
the
other
two
the
spaniards
his
thoughts
naturally
turned
to
the
king
of
the
indians
and
he
sighed
do
you
know
sir
he
asked
basilio
respectfully
if
his
right
foot
is
loose
yet
basilio
had
him
repeat
the
question
whose
right
foot
the
king
whispered
the
cochero
mysteriously
what
king
our
king
the
king
of
the
indians
basilio
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
while
the
cochero
again
sighed
the
indians
in
the
country
places
preserve
the
legend
that
their
king
imprisoned
and
chained
in
the
cave
of
san
mateo
will
come
some
day
to
free
them
every
hundredth
year
he
breaks
one
of
his
chains
so
that
he
now
has
his
hands
and
his
left
foot
loose
only
the
right
foot
remains
bound
this
king
causes
the
earthquakes
when
he
struggles
or
stirs
himself
and
he
is
so
strong
that
in
shaking
hands
with
him
it
is
necessary
to
extend
to
him
a
bone
which
he
crushes
in
his
grasp
for
some
unexplainable
reason
the
indians
call
him
king
bernardo
perhaps
by
confusing
him
with
bernardo
del
carpio
when
he
gets
his
right
foot
loose
muttered
the
cochero
stifling
another
sigh
i
give
him
my
horses
and
offer
him
my
services
even
to
death
for
he
free
us
from
the
civil
guard
with
a
melancholy
gaze
he
watched
the
three
kings
move
on
the
boys
came
behind
in
two
files
sad
and
serious
as
though
they
were
there
under
compulsion
they
lighted
their
way
some
with
torches
others
with
tapers
and
others
with
paper
lanterns
on
bamboo
poles
while
they
recited
the
rosary
at
the
top
of
their
voices
as
though
quarreling
with
somebody
afterwards
came
joseph
on
a
modest
float
with
a
look
of
sadness
and
resignation
on
his
face
carrying
his
stalk
of
lilies
as
he
moved
along
between
two
as
though
he
were
a
prisoner
this
enabled
the
cochero
to
understand
the
expression
on
the
saint
face
but
whether
the
sight
of
the
guards
troubled
him
or
he
had
no
great
respect
for
a
saint
who
would
travel
in
such
company
he
did
not
recite
a
single
requiem
behind
joseph
came
the
girls
bearing
lights
their
heads
covered
with
handkerchiefs
knotted
under
their
chins
also
reciting
the
rosary
but
with
less
wrath
than
the
boys
in
their
midst
were
to
be
seen
several
lads
dragging
along
little
rabbits
made
of
japanese
paper
lighted
by
red
candles
with
their
short
paper
tails
erect
the
lads
brought
those
toys
into
the
procession
to
enliven
the
birth
of
the
messiah
the
little
animals
fat
and
round
as
eggs
seemed
to
be
so
pleased
that
at
times
they
would
take
a
leap
lose
their
balance
fall
and
catch
fire
the
owner
would
then
hasten
to
extinguish
such
burning
enthusiasm
puffing
and
blowing
until
he
finally
beat
out
the
fire
and
then
seeing
his
toy
destroyed
would
fall
to
weeping
the
cochero
observed
with
sadness
that
the
race
of
little
paper
animals
disappeared
each
year
as
if
they
had
been
attacked
by
the
pest
like
the
living
animals
he
the
abused
sinong
remembered
his
two
magnificent
horses
which
at
the
advice
of
the
curate
he
had
caused
to
be
blessed
to
save
them
from
plague
spending
therefor
ten
pesos
for
neither
the
government
nor
the
curates
have
found
any
better
remedy
for
the
epizootic
and
they
had
died
after
all
yet
he
consoled
himself
by
remembering
also
that
after
the
shower
of
holy
water
the
latin
phrases
of
the
padre
and
the
ceremonies
the
horses
had
become
so
vain
and
that
they
would
not
even
allow
him
sinong
a
good
christian
to
put
them
in
harness
and
he
had
not
dared
to
whip
them
because
a
tertiary
sister
had
said
that
they
were
the
procession
was
closed
by
the
virgin
dressed
as
the
divine
shepherd
with
a
pilgrim
hat
of
wide
brim
and
long
plumes
to
indicate
the
journey
to
jerusalem
that
the
birth
might
be
made
more
explicable
the
curate
had
ordered
her
figure
to
be
stuffed
with
rags
and
cotton
under
her
skirt
so
that
no
one
could
be
in
any
doubt
as
to
her
condition
it
was
a
very
beautiful
image
with
the
same
sad
expression
of
all
the
images
that
the
filipinos
make
and
a
mien
somewhat
ashamed
doubtless
at
the
way
in
which
the
curate
had
arranged
her
in
front
came
several
singers
and
behind
some
musicians
with
the
usual
the
curate
as
was
to
be
expected
after
what
he
had
done
was
not
in
his
place
for
that
year
he
was
greatly
displeased
at
having
to
use
all
his
diplomacy
and
shrewdness
to
convince
the
townspeople
that
they
should
pay
thirty
pesos
for
each
christmas
mass
instead
of
the
usual
twenty
you
turning
filibusters
he
had
said
to
them
the
cochero
must
have
been
greatly
preoccupied
with
the
sights
of
the
procession
for
when
it
had
passed
and
basilio
ordered
him
to
go
on
he
did
not
notice
that
the
lamp
on
his
carromata
had
gone
out
neither
did
basilio
notice
it
his
attention
being
devoted
to
gazing
at
the
houses
which
were
illuminated
inside
and
out
with
little
paper
lanterns
of
fantastic
shapes
and
colors
stars
surrounded
by
hoops
with
long
streamers
which
produced
a
pleasant
murmur
when
shaken
by
the
wind
and
fishes
of
movable
heads
and
tails
having
a
glass
of
oil
inside
suspended
from
the
eaves
of
the
windows
in
the
delightful
fashion
of
a
happy
and
homelike
fiesta
but
he
also
noticed
that
the
lights
were
flickering
that
the
stars
were
being
eclipsed
that
this
year
had
fewer
ornaments
and
hangings
than
the
former
which
in
turn
had
had
even
fewer
than
the
year
preceding
it
there
was
scarcely
any
music
in
the
streets
while
the
agreeable
noises
of
the
kitchen
were
not
to
be
heard
in
all
the
houses
which
the
youth
ascribed
to
the
fact
that
for
some
time
things
had
been
going
badly
the
sugar
did
not
bring
a
good
price
the
rice
crops
had
failed
over
half
the
live
stock
had
died
but
the
taxes
rose
and
increased
for
some
inexplicable
reason
while
the
abuses
of
the
civil
guard
became
more
frequent
to
kill
off
the
happiness
of
the
people
in
the
towns
he
was
just
pondering
over
this
when
an
energetic
halt
resounded
they
were
passing
in
front
of
the
barracks
and
one
of
the
guards
had
noticed
the
extinguished
lamp
of
the
carromata
which
could
not
go
on
without
it
a
hail
of
insults
fell
about
the
poor
cochero
who
vainly
excused
himself
with
the
length
of
the
procession
he
would
be
arrested
for
violating
the
ordinances
and
afterwards
advertised
in
the
newspapers
so
the
peaceful
and
prudent
basilio
left
the
carromata
and
went
his
way
on
foot
carrying
his
valise
this
was
san
diego
his
native
town
where
he
had
not
a
single
relative
the
only
house
wherein
there
seemed
to
be
any
mirth
was
capitan
basilio
hens
and
chickens
cackled
their
death
chant
to
the
accompaniment
of
dry
and
repeated
strokes
as
of
meat
pounded
on
a
and
the
sizzling
of
grease
in
the
a
feast
was
going
on
in
the
house
and
even
into
the
street
there
passed
a
certain
draught
of
air
saturated
with
the
succulent
odors
of
stews
and
confections
in
the
entresol
basilio
saw
sinang
as
small
as
when
our
readers
knew
her
before
although
a
little
rounder
and
plumper
since
her
marriage
then
to
his
great
surprise
he
made
out
further
in
at
the
back
of
the
room
chatting
with
capitan
basilio
the
curate
and
the
alferez
of
the
civil
guard
no
less
than
the
jeweler
simoun
as
ever
with
his
blue
goggles
and
his
nonchalant
air
it
understood
señor
simoun
capitan
basilio
was
saying
that
we
go
to
tiani
to
see
your
jewels
i
would
also
go
remarked
the
alferez
because
i
need
a
but
i
so
busy
if
capitan
basilio
would
undertake
capitan
basilio
would
do
so
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
as
he
wished
to
propitiate
the
soldier
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
molested
in
the
persons
of
his
laborers
he
refused
to
accept
the
money
which
the
alferez
was
trying
to
get
out
of
his
pocket
it
my
christmas
gift
i
ca
allow
you
capitan
i
ca
permit
it
all
right
we
settle
up
afterwards
replied
capitan
basilio
with
a
lordly
gesture
also
the
curate
wanted
a
pair
of
lady
earrings
and
requested
the
capitan
to
buy
them
for
him
i
want
them
first
class
later
fix
up
the
account
do
worry
about
that
padre
said
the
good
man
who
wished
to
be
at
peace
with
the
church
also
an
unfavorable
report
on
the
part
could
do
him
great
damage
and
cause
him
double
the
expense
for
those
earrings
were
a
forced
present
simoun
in
the
meantime
was
praising
his
jewels
that
fellow
is
fierce
mused
the
student
he
does
business
everywhere
and
if
i
can
believe
certain
person
he
buys
from
some
gentlemen
for
a
half
of
their
value
the
same
jewels
that
he
himself
has
sold
for
presents
everybody
in
this
country
prospers
but
us
he
made
his
way
to
his
house
or
rather
capitan
tiago
now
occupied
by
a
trustworthy
man
who
had
held
him
in
great
esteem
since
the
day
when
he
had
seen
him
perform
a
surgical
operation
with
the
same
coolness
that
he
would
cut
up
a
chicken
this
man
was
now
waiting
to
give
him
the
news
two
of
the
laborers
were
prisoners
one
was
to
be
deported
and
a
number
of
carabaos
had
died
the
same
old
story
exclaimed
basilio
in
a
bad
humor
you
always
receive
me
with
the
same
complaints
the
youth
was
not
overbearing
but
as
he
was
at
times
scolded
by
capitan
tiago
he
liked
in
his
turn
to
chide
those
under
his
orders
the
old
man
cast
about
for
something
new
one
of
our
tenants
has
died
the
old
fellow
who
took
care
of
the
woods
and
the
curate
refused
to
bury
him
as
a
pauper
saying
that
his
master
is
a
rich
man
what
did
he
die
of
of
old
age
get
out
to
die
of
old
age
it
must
at
least
have
been
some
disease
basilio
in
his
zeal
for
making
autopsies
wanted
diseases
have
you
anything
new
to
tell
me
you
take
away
my
appetite
relating
the
same
old
things
do
you
know
anything
of
sagpang
the
old
man
then
told
him
about
the
kidnapping
of
cabesang
tales
basilio
became
thoughtful
and
said
nothing
more
his
appetite
had
completely
left
him
chapter
vi
basilio
when
the
bells
began
their
chimes
for
the
midnight
mass
and
those
who
preferred
a
good
sleep
to
fiestas
and
ceremonies
arose
grumbling
at
the
noise
and
movement
basilio
cautiously
left
the
house
took
two
or
three
turns
through
the
streets
to
see
that
he
was
not
watched
or
followed
and
then
made
his
way
by
unfrequented
paths
to
the
road
that
led
to
the
ancient
wood
of
the
ibarras
which
had
been
acquired
by
capitan
tiago
when
their
property
was
confiscated
and
sold
as
christmas
fell
under
the
waning
moon
that
year
the
place
was
wrapped
in
darkness
the
chimes
had
ceased
and
only
the
tolling
sounded
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
amid
the
murmur
of
the
branches
and
the
measured
roar
of
the
waves
on
the
neighboring
lake
like
the
deep
respiration
of
nature
sunk
in
profound
sleep
awed
by
the
time
and
place
the
youth
moved
along
with
his
head
down
as
if
endeavoring
to
see
through
the
darkness
but
from
time
to
time
he
raised
it
to
gaze
at
the
stars
through
the
open
spaces
between
the
treetops
and
went
forward
parting
the
bushes
or
tearing
away
the
lianas
that
obstructed
his
path
at
times
he
retraced
his
steps
his
foot
would
get
caught
among
the
plants
he
stumbled
over
a
projecting
root
or
a
fallen
log
at
the
end
of
a
he
reached
a
small
brook
on
the
opposite
side
of
which
arose
a
hillock
a
black
and
shapeless
mass
that
in
the
darkness
took
on
the
proportions
of
a
mountain
basilio
crossed
the
brook
on
the
stones
that
showed
black
against
the
shining
surface
of
the
water
ascended
the
hill
and
made
his
way
to
a
small
space
enclosed
by
old
and
crumbling
walls
he
approached
the
balete
tree
that
rose
in
the
center
huge
mysterious
venerable
formed
of
roots
that
extended
up
and
down
among
the
trunks
pausing
before
a
heap
of
stones
he
took
off
his
hat
and
seemed
to
be
praying
there
his
mother
was
buried
and
every
time
he
came
to
the
town
his
first
visit
was
to
that
neglected
and
unknown
grave
since
he
must
visit
cabesang
tales
family
the
next
day
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
night
to
perform
this
duty
seated
on
a
stone
he
seemed
to
fall
into
deep
thought
his
past
rose
before
him
like
a
long
black
film
rosy
at
first
then
shadowy
with
spots
of
blood
then
black
black
gray
and
then
light
ever
lighter
the
end
could
not
be
seen
hidden
as
it
was
by
a
cloud
through
which
shone
lights
and
the
hues
of
dawn
thirteen
years
before
to
the
day
almost
to
the
hour
his
mother
had
died
there
in
the
deepest
distress
on
a
glorious
night
when
the
moon
shone
brightly
and
the
christians
of
the
world
were
engaged
in
rejoicing
wounded
and
limping
he
had
reached
there
in
pursuit
of
her
she
mad
and
terrified
fleeing
from
her
son
as
from
a
ghost
there
she
had
died
and
there
had
come
a
stranger
who
had
commanded
him
to
build
a
funeral
pyre
he
had
obeyed
mechanically
and
when
he
returned
he
found
a
second
stranger
by
the
side
of
the
other
corpse
what
a
night
and
what
a
morning
those
were
the
stranger
helped
him
raise
the
pyre
whereon
they
burned
the
corpse
of
the
first
dug
the
grave
in
which
they
buried
his
mother
and
then
after
giving
him
some
pieces
of
money
told
him
to
leave
the
place
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
seen
that
man
tall
with
eyes
pale
lips
and
a
sharp
nose
entirely
alone
in
the
world
without
parents
or
brothers
and
sisters
he
left
the
town
whose
authorities
inspired
in
him
such
great
fear
and
went
to
manila
to
work
in
some
rich
house
and
study
at
the
same
time
as
many
do
his
journey
was
an
odyssey
of
sleeplessness
and
startling
surprises
in
which
hunger
counted
for
little
for
he
ate
the
fruits
in
the
woods
whither
he
retreated
whenever
he
made
out
from
afar
the
uniform
of
the
civil
guard
a
sight
that
recalled
the
origin
of
all
his
misfortunes
once
in
manila
ragged
and
sick
he
went
from
door
to
door
offering
his
services
a
boy
from
the
provinces
who
knew
not
a
single
word
of
spanish
and
sickly
besides
discouraged
hungry
and
miserable
he
wandered
about
the
streets
attracting
attention
by
the
wretchedness
of
his
clothing
how
often
was
he
tempted
to
throw
himself
under
the
feet
of
the
horses
that
flashed
by
drawing
carriages
shining
with
silver
and
varnish
thus
to
end
his
misery
at
once
fortunately
he
saw
capitan
tiago
accompanied
by
aunt
isabel
he
had
known
them
since
the
days
in
san
diego
and
in
his
joy
believed
that
in
them
he
saw
almost
he
followed
the
carriage
until
he
lost
sight
of
it
and
then
made
inquiries
for
the
house
as
it
was
the
very
day
that
maria
clara
entered
the
nunnery
and
capitan
tiago
was
accordingly
depressed
he
was
admitted
as
a
servant
without
pay
but
instead
with
leave
to
study
if
he
so
wished
in
san
juan
de
letran
dirty
poorly
dressed
with
only
a
pair
of
clogs
for
footwear
at
the
end
of
several
months
stay
in
manila
he
entered
the
first
year
of
latin
on
seeing
his
clothes
his
classmates
drew
away
from
him
and
the
professor
a
handsome
dominican
never
asked
him
a
question
but
frowned
every
time
he
looked
at
him
in
the
eight
months
that
the
class
continued
the
only
words
that
passed
between
them
were
his
name
read
from
the
roll
and
the
daily
with
which
the
student
responded
with
what
bitterness
he
left
the
class
each
day
and
guessing
the
reason
for
the
treatment
accorded
him
what
tears
sprang
into
his
eyes
and
what
complaints
were
stifled
in
his
heart
how
he
had
wept
and
sobbed
over
the
grave
of
his
mother
relating
to
her
his
hidden
sorrows
humiliations
and
affronts
when
at
the
approach
of
christmas
capitan
tiago
had
taken
him
back
to
san
diego
yet
he
memorized
the
lessons
without
omitting
a
comma
although
he
understood
scarcely
any
part
of
them
but
at
length
he
became
resigned
noticing
that
among
the
three
or
four
hundred
in
his
class
only
about
forty
merited
the
honor
of
being
questioned
because
they
attracted
the
professor
attention
by
their
appearance
some
prank
comicality
or
other
cause
the
greater
part
of
the
students
congratulated
themselves
that
they
thus
escaped
the
work
of
thinking
and
understanding
the
subject
one
goes
to
college
not
to
learn
and
study
but
to
gain
credit
for
the
course
so
if
the
book
can
be
memorized
what
more
can
be
asked
the
year
is
thus
gained
basilio
passed
the
examinations
by
answering
the
solitary
question
asked
him
like
a
machine
without
stopping
or
breathing
and
in
the
amusement
of
the
examiners
won
the
passing
certificate
his
nine
companions
they
were
examined
in
batches
of
ten
in
order
to
save
time
did
not
have
such
good
luck
but
were
condemned
to
repeat
the
year
of
brutalization
in
the
second
year
the
that
he
tended
won
a
large
sum
and
he
received
from
capitan
tiago
a
big
tip
which
he
immediately
invested
in
the
purchase
of
shoes
and
a
felt
hat
with
these
and
the
clothes
given
him
by
his
employer
which
he
made
over
to
fit
his
person
his
appearance
became
more
decent
but
did
not
get
beyond
that
in
such
a
large
class
a
great
deal
was
needed
to
attract
the
attention
and
the
student
who
in
the
first
year
did
not
make
himself
known
by
some
special
quality
or
did
not
capture
the
of
the
professors
could
with
difficulty
make
himself
known
in
the
rest
of
his
but
basilio
kept
on
for
perseverance
was
his
chief
trait
his
fortune
seemed
to
change
somewhat
when
he
entered
the
third
year
his
professor
happened
to
be
a
very
jolly
fellow
fond
of
jokes
and
of
making
the
students
laugh
complacent
enough
in
that
he
almost
always
had
his
favorites
recite
the
lessons
in
fact
he
was
satisfied
with
anything
at
this
time
basilio
now
wore
shoes
and
a
clean
and
camisa
as
his
professor
noticed
that
he
laughed
very
little
at
the
jokes
and
that
his
large
eyes
seemed
to
be
asking
something
like
an
eternal
question
he
took
him
for
a
fool
and
one
day
decided
to
make
him
conspicuous
by
calling
on
him
for
the
lesson
basilio
recited
it
from
beginning
to
end
without
hesitating
over
a
single
letter
so
the
professor
called
him
a
parrot
and
told
a
story
to
make
the
class
laugh
then
to
increase
the
hilarity
and
justify
the
epithet
he
asked
several
questions
at
the
same
time
winking
to
his
favorites
as
if
to
say
to
them
you
see
how
we
going
to
amuse
ourselves
basilio
now
understood
spanish
and
answered
the
questions
with
the
plain
intention
of
making
no
one
laugh
this
disgusted
everybody
the
expected
absurdity
did
not
materialize
no
one
could
laugh
and
the
good
friar
never
pardoned
him
for
having
defrauded
the
hopes
of
the
class
and
disappointed
his
own
prophecies
but
who
would
expect
anything
worth
while
to
come
from
a
head
so
badly
combed
and
placed
on
an
indian
poorly
shod
classified
until
recently
among
the
arboreal
animals
as
in
other
centers
of
learning
where
the
teachers
are
honestly
desirous
that
the
students
should
learn
such
discoveries
usually
delight
the
instructors
so
in
a
college
managed
by
men
convinced
that
for
the
most
part
knowledge
is
an
evil
at
least
for
the
students
the
episode
of
basilio
produced
a
bad
impression
and
he
was
not
questioned
again
during
the
year
why
should
he
be
when
he
made
no
one
laugh
quite
discouraged
and
thinking
of
abandoning
his
studies
he
passed
to
the
fourth
year
of
latin
why
study
at
all
why
not
sleep
like
the
others
and
trust
to
luck
one
of
the
two
professors
was
very
popular
beloved
by
all
passing
for
a
sage
a
great
poet
and
a
man
of
advanced
ideas
one
day
when
he
accompanied
the
collegians
on
their
walk
he
had
a
dispute
with
some
cadets
which
resulted
in
a
skirmish
and
a
challenge
no
doubt
recalling
his
brilliant
youth
the
professor
preached
a
crusade
and
promised
good
marks
to
all
who
during
the
promenade
on
the
following
sunday
would
take
part
in
the
fray
the
week
was
a
lively
one
there
were
occasional
encounters
in
which
canes
and
sabers
were
crossed
and
in
one
of
these
basilio
distinguished
himself
borne
in
triumph
by
the
students
and
presented
to
the
professor
he
thus
became
known
to
him
and
came
to
be
his
favorite
partly
for
this
reason
and
partly
from
his
diligence
that
year
he
received
the
highest
marks
medals
included
in
view
of
which
capitan
tiago
who
since
his
daughter
had
become
a
nun
exhibited
some
aversion
to
the
friars
in
a
fit
of
good
humor
induced
him
to
transfer
to
the
ateneo
municipal
the
fame
of
which
was
then
in
its
apogee
here
a
new
world
opened
before
his
eyes
a
system
of
instruction
that
he
had
never
dreamed
of
except
for
a
few
superfluities
and
some
childish
things
he
was
filled
with
admiration
for
the
methods
there
used
and
with
gratitude
for
the
zeal
of
the
instructors
his
eyes
at
times
filled
with
tears
when
he
thought
of
the
four
previous
years
during
which
from
lack
of
means
he
had
been
unable
to
study
at
that
center
he
had
to
make
extraordinary
efforts
to
get
himself
to
the
level
of
those
who
had
had
a
good
preparatory
course
and
it
might
be
said
that
in
that
one
year
he
learned
the
whole
five
of
the
secondary
curricula
he
received
his
bachelor
degree
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
his
instructors
who
in
the
examinations
showed
themselves
to
be
proud
of
him
before
the
dominican
examiners
sent
there
to
inspect
the
school
one
of
these
as
if
to
dampen
such
great
enthusiasm
a
little
asked
him
where
he
had
studied
the
first
years
of
latin
in
san
juan
de
letran
padre
answered
basilio
aha
of
course
he
not
bad
in
latin
the
dominican
then
remarked
with
a
slight
smile
from
choice
and
temperament
he
selected
the
course
in
medicine
capitan
tiago
preferred
the
law
in
order
that
he
might
have
a
lawyer
free
but
knowledge
of
the
laws
is
not
sufficient
to
secure
clientage
in
the
philippines
it
is
necessary
to
win
the
cases
and
for
this
friendships
are
required
influence
in
certain
spheres
a
good
deal
of
astuteness
capitan
tiago
finally
gave
in
remembering
that
medical
students
get
on
intimate
terms
with
corpses
and
for
some
time
he
had
been
seeking
a
poison
to
put
on
the
gaffs
of
his
the
best
he
had
been
able
to
secure
thus
far
being
the
blood
of
a
chinaman
who
had
died
of
syphilis
with
equal
diligence
or
more
if
possible
the
young
man
continued
this
course
and
after
the
third
year
began
to
render
medical
services
with
such
great
success
that
he
was
not
only
preparing
a
brilliant
future
for
himself
but
also
earning
enough
to
dress
well
and
save
some
money
this
was
the
last
year
of
the
course
and
in
two
months
he
would
be
a
physician
he
would
come
back
to
the
town
he
would
marry
juliana
and
they
would
be
happy
the
granting
of
his
licentiateship
was
not
only
assured
but
he
expected
it
to
be
the
crowning
act
of
his
for
he
had
been
designated
to
deliver
the
valedictory
at
the
graduation
and
already
he
saw
himself
in
the
rostrum
before
the
whole
faculty
the
object
of
public
attention
all
those
heads
leaders
of
manila
science
in
their
colored
capes
all
the
women
who
came
there
out
of
curiosity
and
who
years
before
had
gazed
at
him
if
not
with
disdain
at
least
with
indifference
all
those
men
whose
carriages
had
once
been
about
to
crush
him
down
in
the
mud
like
a
dog
they
would
listen
attentively
and
he
was
going
to
say
something
to
them
that
would
not
be
trivial
something
that
had
never
before
resounded
in
that
place
he
was
going
to
forget
himself
in
order
to
aid
the
poor
students
of
the
future
and
he
would
make
his
entrance
on
his
work
in
the
world
with
that
speech
chapter
vii
simoun
over
these
matters
basilio
was
pondering
as
he
visited
his
grave
he
was
about
to
start
back
to
the
town
when
he
thought
he
saw
a
light
flickering
among
the
trees
and
heard
the
snapping
of
twigs
the
sound
of
feet
and
rustling
of
leaves
the
light
disappeared
but
the
noises
became
more
distinct
coming
directly
toward
where
he
was
basilio
was
not
naturally
superstitious
especially
after
having
carved
up
so
many
corpses
and
watched
beside
so
many
but
the
old
legends
about
that
ghostly
spot
the
hour
the
darkness
the
melancholy
sighing
of
the
wind
and
certain
tales
heard
in
his
childhood
asserted
their
influence
over
his
mind
and
made
his
heart
beat
violently
the
figure
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
the
balete
but
the
youth
could
see
it
through
an
open
space
between
two
roots
that
had
grown
in
the
course
of
time
to
the
proportions
of
it
produced
from
under
its
coat
a
lantern
with
a
powerful
reflecting
lens
which
it
placed
on
the
ground
thereby
lighting
up
a
pair
of
the
rest
of
the
figure
remaining
concealed
in
the
darkness
the
figure
seemed
to
search
its
pockets
and
then
bent
over
to
fix
a
on
the
end
of
a
stout
cane
to
his
great
surprise
basilio
thought
he
could
make
out
some
of
the
features
of
the
jeweler
simoun
who
indeed
it
was
the
jeweler
dug
in
the
ground
and
from
time
to
time
the
lantern
illuminated
his
face
on
which
were
not
now
the
blue
goggles
that
so
completely
disguised
him
basilio
shuddered
that
was
the
same
stranger
who
thirteen
years
before
had
dug
his
mother
grave
there
only
now
he
had
aged
somewhat
his
hair
had
turned
white
he
wore
a
beard
and
a
mustache
but
yet
his
look
was
the
same
the
bitter
expression
the
same
cloud
on
his
brow
the
same
muscular
arms
though
somewhat
thinner
now
the
same
violent
energy
old
impressions
were
stirred
in
the
boy
he
seemed
to
feel
the
heat
of
the
fire
the
hunger
the
weariness
of
that
time
the
smell
of
freshly
turned
earth
yet
his
discovery
terrified
him
that
jeweler
simoun
who
passed
for
a
british
indian
a
portuguese
an
american
a
mulatto
the
brown
cardinal
his
black
eminence
the
evil
genius
of
the
as
many
called
him
was
no
other
than
the
mysterious
stranger
whose
appearance
and
disappearance
coincided
with
the
death
of
the
heir
to
that
land
but
of
the
two
strangers
who
had
appeared
which
was
ibarra
the
living
or
the
dead
this
question
which
he
had
often
asked
himself
whenever
ibarra
death
was
mentioned
again
came
into
his
mind
in
the
presence
of
the
human
enigma
he
now
saw
before
him
the
dead
man
had
had
two
wounds
which
must
have
been
made
by
firearms
as
he
knew
from
what
he
had
since
studied
and
which
would
be
the
result
of
the
chase
on
the
lake
then
the
dead
man
must
have
been
ibarra
who
had
come
to
die
at
the
tomb
of
his
forefathers
his
desire
to
be
cremated
being
explained
by
his
residence
in
europe
where
cremation
is
practised
then
who
was
the
other
the
living
this
jeweler
simoun
at
that
time
with
such
an
appearance
of
poverty
and
wretchedness
but
who
had
now
returned
loaded
with
gold
and
a
friend
of
the
authorities
there
was
the
mystery
and
the
student
with
his
characteristic
determined
to
clear
it
up
at
the
first
opportunity
simoun
dug
away
for
some
time
but
basilio
noticed
that
his
old
vigor
had
declined
he
panted
and
had
to
rest
every
few
moments
fearing
that
he
might
be
discovered
the
boy
made
a
sudden
resolution
rising
from
his
seat
and
issuing
from
his
he
asked
in
the
most
tone
can
i
help
you
sir
simoun
straightened
up
with
the
spring
of
a
tiger
attacked
at
his
prey
thrust
his
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
and
stared
at
the
student
with
a
pale
and
lowering
gaze
thirteen
years
ago
you
rendered
me
a
great
service
sir
went
on
basilio
unmoved
in
this
very
place
by
burying
my
mother
and
i
should
consider
myself
happy
if
i
could
serve
you
now
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
youth
simoun
drew
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
the
click
of
a
hammer
being
cocked
was
heard
for
whom
do
you
take
me
he
asked
retreating
a
few
paces
for
a
person
who
is
sacred
to
me
replied
basilio
with
some
emotion
for
he
thought
his
last
moment
had
come
for
a
person
whom
all
except
me
believe
to
be
dead
and
whose
misfortunes
i
have
always
lamented
an
impressive
silence
followed
these
words
a
silence
that
to
the
youth
seemed
to
suggest
eternity
but
simoun
after
some
hesitation
approached
him
and
placing
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
said
in
a
moving
tone
basilio
you
possess
a
secret
that
can
ruin
me
and
now
you
have
just
surprised
me
in
another
which
puts
me
completely
in
your
hands
the
divulging
of
which
would
upset
all
my
plans
for
my
own
security
and
for
the
good
of
the
cause
in
which
i
labor
i
ought
to
seal
your
lips
forever
for
what
is
the
life
of
one
man
compared
to
the
end
i
seek
the
occasion
is
fitting
no
one
knows
that
i
have
come
here
i
am
armed
you
are
defenceless
your
death
would
be
attributed
to
the
outlaws
if
not
to
more
supernatural
causes
yet
i
let
you
live
and
trust
that
i
shall
not
regret
it
you
have
toiled
you
have
struggled
with
energetic
perseverance
and
like
myself
you
have
your
scores
to
settle
with
society
your
brother
was
murdered
your
mother
driven
to
insanity
and
society
has
prosecuted
neither
the
assassin
nor
the
executioner
you
and
i
are
the
dregs
of
justice
and
instead
of
destroying
we
ought
to
aid
each
other
simoun
paused
with
a
repressed
sigh
and
then
slowly
resumed
while
his
gaze
wandered
about
yes
i
am
he
who
came
here
thirteen
years
ago
sick
and
wretched
to
pay
the
last
tribute
to
a
great
and
noble
soul
that
was
willing
to
die
for
me
the
victim
of
a
vicious
system
i
have
wandered
over
the
world
working
night
and
day
to
amass
a
fortune
and
carry
out
my
plan
now
i
have
returned
to
destroy
that
system
to
precipitate
its
downfall
to
hurl
it
into
the
abyss
toward
which
it
is
senselessly
rushing
even
though
i
may
have
to
shed
oceans
of
tears
and
blood
it
has
condemned
itself
it
stands
condemned
and
i
do
want
to
die
before
i
have
seen
it
in
fragments
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
simoun
extended
both
his
arms
toward
the
earth
as
if
with
that
gesture
he
would
like
to
hold
there
the
broken
remains
his
voice
took
on
a
sinister
even
lugubrious
tone
which
made
the
student
shudder
called
by
the
vices
of
the
rulers
i
have
returned
to
these
islands
and
under
the
cloak
of
a
merchant
have
visited
the
towns
my
gold
has
opened
a
way
for
me
and
wheresoever
i
have
beheld
greed
in
the
most
execrable
forms
sometimes
hypocritical
sometimes
shameless
sometimes
cruel
fatten
on
the
dead
organism
like
a
vulture
on
a
corpse
i
have
asked
myself
why
was
there
not
festering
in
its
vitals
the
corruption
the
ptomaine
the
poison
of
the
tombs
to
kill
the
foul
bird
the
corpse
was
letting
itself
be
consumed
the
vulture
was
gorging
itself
with
meat
and
because
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
give
it
life
so
that
it
might
turn
against
its
destroyer
and
because
the
corruption
developed
slowly
i
have
stimulated
greed
i
have
abetted
it
the
cases
of
injustice
and
the
abuses
multiplied
themselves
i
have
instigated
crime
and
acts
of
cruelty
so
that
the
people
might
become
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
death
i
have
stirred
up
trouble
so
that
to
escape
from
it
some
remedy
might
be
found
i
have
placed
obstacles
in
the
way
of
trade
so
that
the
country
impoverished
and
reduced
to
misery
might
no
longer
be
afraid
of
anything
i
have
excited
desires
to
plunder
the
treasury
and
as
this
has
not
been
enough
to
bring
about
a
popular
uprising
i
have
wounded
the
people
in
their
most
sensitive
fiber
i
have
made
the
vulture
itself
insult
the
very
corpse
that
it
feeds
upon
and
hasten
the
corruption
now
when
i
was
about
to
get
the
supreme
rottenness
the
supreme
filth
the
mixture
of
such
foul
products
brewing
poison
when
the
greed
was
beginning
to
irritate
in
its
folly
hastening
to
seize
whatever
came
to
hand
like
an
old
woman
caught
in
a
conflagration
here
you
come
with
your
cries
of
hispanism
with
chants
of
confidence
in
the
government
in
what
can
not
come
to
pass
here
you
have
a
body
palpitating
with
heat
and
life
young
pure
vigorous
throbbing
with
blood
with
enthusiasm
suddenly
come
forth
to
offer
itself
again
as
fresh
food
ah
youth
is
ever
inexperienced
and
dreamy
always
running
after
the
butterflies
and
flowers
you
have
united
so
that
by
your
efforts
you
may
bind
your
fatherland
to
spain
with
garlands
of
roses
when
in
reality
you
are
forging
upon
it
chains
harder
than
the
diamond
you
ask
for
equal
rights
the
hispanization
of
your
customs
and
you
see
that
what
you
are
begging
for
is
suicide
the
destruction
of
your
nationality
the
annihilation
of
your
fatherland
the
consecration
of
tyranny
what
will
you
be
in
the
future
a
people
without
character
a
nation
without
liberty
everything
you
have
will
be
borrowed
even
your
very
defects
you
beg
for
hispanization
and
do
not
pale
with
shame
when
they
deny
it
you
and
even
if
they
should
grant
it
to
you
what
then
what
have
you
gained
at
best
a
country
of
pronunciamentos
a
land
of
civil
wars
a
republic
of
the
greedy
and
the
malcontents
like
some
of
the
republics
of
south
america
to
what
are
you
tending
now
with
your
instruction
in
castilian
a
pretension
that
would
be
ridiculous
were
it
not
for
its
deplorable
consequences
you
wish
to
add
one
more
language
to
the
forty
odd
that
are
spoken
in
the
islands
so
that
you
may
understand
one
another
less
and
less
on
the
contrary
replied
basilio
if
the
knowledge
of
castilian
may
bind
us
to
the
government
in
exchange
it
may
also
unite
the
islands
among
themselves
a
gross
error
rejoined
simoun
you
are
letting
yourselves
be
deceived
by
big
words
and
never
go
to
the
bottom
of
things
to
examine
the
results
in
their
final
analysis
spanish
will
never
be
the
general
language
of
the
country
the
people
will
never
talk
it
because
the
conceptions
of
their
brains
and
the
feelings
of
their
hearts
can
not
be
expressed
in
that
language
each
people
has
its
own
tongue
as
it
has
its
own
way
of
thinking
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
castilian
the
few
of
you
who
will
speak
it
kill
off
your
own
originality
subordinate
your
thoughts
to
other
brains
and
instead
of
freeing
yourselves
make
yourselves
slaves
indeed
of
those
of
you
who
pretend
to
be
enlightened
are
renegades
to
your
country
he
among
you
who
talks
that
language
neglects
his
own
in
such
a
way
that
he
neither
writes
nor
understands
it
and
how
many
have
i
not
seen
who
pretended
not
to
know
a
single
word
of
it
but
fortunately
you
have
an
imbecile
government
while
russia
enslaves
poland
by
forcing
the
russian
language
upon
it
while
germany
prohibits
french
in
the
conquered
provinces
your
government
strives
to
preserve
yours
and
you
in
return
a
remarkable
people
under
an
incredible
government
you
are
trying
to
despoil
yourselves
of
your
own
nationality
one
and
all
you
forget
that
while
a
people
preserves
its
language
it
preserves
the
marks
of
its
liberty
as
a
man
preserves
his
independence
while
he
holds
to
his
own
way
of
thinking
language
is
the
thought
of
the
peoples
luckily
your
independence
is
assured
human
passions
are
looking
out
for
that
simoun
paused
and
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
the
waning
moon
was
rising
and
sent
its
faint
light
down
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
with
his
white
locks
and
severe
features
illuminated
from
below
by
the
lantern
the
jeweler
appeared
to
be
the
fateful
spirit
of
the
wood
planning
some
evil
basilio
was
silent
before
such
bitter
reproaches
and
listened
with
bowed
head
while
simoun
resumed
i
saw
this
movement
started
and
have
passed
whole
nights
of
anguish
because
i
understood
that
among
those
youths
there
were
exceptional
minds
and
hearts
sacrificing
themselves
for
what
they
thought
to
be
a
good
cause
when
in
reality
they
were
working
against
their
own
country
how
many
times
have
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
young
men
to
reveal
myself
and
undeceive
you
but
in
view
of
the
reputation
i
enjoy
my
words
would
have
been
wrongly
interpreted
and
would
perhaps
have
had
a
counter
effect
how
many
times
have
i
not
longed
to
approach
your
makaraig
your
isagani
sometimes
i
thought
of
their
death
i
wished
to
destroy
them
simoun
checked
himself
here
why
i
let
you
live
basilio
and
by
such
imprudence
i
expose
myself
to
the
risk
of
being
some
day
betrayed
by
you
but
you
know
who
i
am
you
know
how
much
i
must
have
suffered
then
believe
in
me
you
are
not
of
the
common
crowd
which
sees
in
the
jeweler
simoun
the
trader
who
incites
the
authorities
to
commit
abuses
in
order
that
the
abused
may
buy
jewels
i
am
the
judge
who
wishes
to
castigate
this
system
by
making
use
of
its
own
defects
to
make
war
on
it
by
flattering
it
i
need
your
help
your
influence
among
the
youth
to
combat
these
senseless
desires
for
hispanization
for
assimilation
for
equal
rights
by
that
road
you
will
become
only
a
poor
copy
and
the
people
should
look
higher
it
is
madness
to
attempt
to
influence
the
thoughts
of
the
rulers
they
have
their
plan
outlined
the
bandage
covers
their
eyes
and
besides
losing
time
uselessly
you
are
deceiving
the
people
with
vain
hopes
and
are
helping
to
bend
their
necks
before
the
tyrant
what
you
should
do
is
to
take
advantage
of
their
prejudices
to
serve
your
needs
are
they
unwilling
that
you
be
assimilated
with
the
spanish
people
good
enough
distinguish
yourselves
then
by
revealing
yourselves
in
your
own
character
try
to
lay
the
foundations
of
the
philippine
fatherland
do
they
deny
you
hope
good
do
depend
on
them
depend
upon
yourselves
and
work
do
they
deny
you
representation
in
their
cortes
so
much
the
better
even
should
you
succeed
in
sending
representatives
of
your
own
choice
what
are
you
going
to
accomplish
there
except
to
be
overwhelmed
among
so
many
voices
and
sanction
with
your
presence
the
abuses
and
wrongs
that
are
afterwards
perpetrated
the
fewer
rights
they
allow
you
the
more
reason
you
will
have
later
to
throw
off
the
yoke
and
return
evil
for
evil
if
they
are
unwilling
to
teach
you
their
language
cultivate
your
own
extend
it
preserve
to
the
people
their
own
way
of
thinking
and
instead
of
aspiring
to
be
a
province
aspire
to
be
a
nation
instead
of
subordinate
thoughts
think
independently
to
the
end
that
neither
by
right
nor
custom
nor
language
the
spaniard
can
be
considered
the
master
here
nor
even
be
looked
upon
as
a
part
of
the
country
but
ever
as
an
invader
a
foreigner
and
sooner
or
later
you
will
have
your
liberty
here
why
i
let
you
live
basilio
breathed
freely
as
though
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
him
and
after
a
brief
pause
replied
sir
the
honor
you
do
me
in
confiding
your
plans
to
me
is
too
great
for
me
not
to
be
frank
with
you
and
tell
you
that
what
you
ask
of
me
is
beyond
my
power
i
am
no
politician
and
if
i
have
signed
the
petition
for
instruction
in
castilian
it
has
been
because
i
saw
in
it
an
advantage
to
our
studies
and
nothing
more
my
destiny
is
different
my
aspiration
reduces
itself
to
alleviating
the
physical
sufferings
of
my
fellow
men
the
jeweler
smiled
what
are
physical
sufferings
compared
to
moral
tortures
what
is
the
death
of
a
man
in
the
presence
of
the
death
of
a
society
some
day
you
will
perhaps
be
a
great
physician
if
they
let
you
go
your
way
in
peace
but
greater
yet
will
be
he
who
can
inject
a
new
idea
into
this
anemic
people
you
what
are
you
doing
for
the
land
that
gave
you
existence
that
supports
your
life
that
affords
you
knowledge
do
you
realize
that
that
is
a
useless
life
which
is
not
consecrated
to
a
great
idea
it
is
a
stone
wasted
in
the
fields
without
becoming
a
part
of
any
edifice
no
no
sir
replied
basilio
modestly
i
not
folding
my
arms
i
working
like
all
the
rest
to
raise
up
from
the
ruins
of
the
past
a
people
whose
units
will
be
bound
together
that
each
one
may
feel
in
himself
the
conscience
and
the
life
of
the
whole
but
however
enthusiastic
our
generation
may
be
we
understand
that
in
this
great
social
fabric
there
must
be
a
division
of
labor
i
have
chosen
my
task
and
will
devote
myself
to
science
science
is
not
the
end
of
man
declared
simoun
the
most
civilized
nations
are
tending
toward
it
yes
but
only
as
a
means
of
seeking
their
welfare
science
is
more
eternal
it
more
human
it
more
universal
exclaimed
the
youth
in
a
transport
of
enthusiasm
within
a
few
centuries
when
humanity
has
become
redeemed
and
enlightened
when
there
are
no
races
when
all
peoples
are
free
when
there
are
neither
tyrants
nor
slaves
colonies
nor
mother
countries
when
justice
rules
and
man
is
a
citizen
of
the
world
the
pursuit
of
science
alone
will
remain
the
word
patriotism
will
be
equivalent
to
fanaticism
and
he
who
prides
himself
on
patriotic
ideas
will
doubtless
be
isolated
as
a
dangerous
disease
as
a
menace
to
the
social
order
simoun
smiled
sadly
yes
yes
he
said
with
a
shake
of
his
head
yet
to
reach
that
condition
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
no
tyrannical
and
no
enslaved
peoples
it
is
necessary
that
man
go
about
freely
that
he
know
how
to
respect
the
rights
of
others
in
their
own
individuality
and
for
this
there
is
yet
much
blood
to
be
shed
the
struggle
forces
itself
forward
to
overcome
the
ancient
fanaticism
that
bound
consciences
it
was
necessary
that
many
should
perish
in
the
holocausts
so
that
the
social
conscience
in
horror
declared
the
individual
conscience
free
it
is
also
necessary
that
all
answer
the
question
which
with
each
day
the
fatherland
asks
them
with
its
fettered
hands
extended
patriotism
can
only
be
a
crime
in
a
tyrannical
people
because
then
it
is
rapine
under
a
beautiful
name
but
however
perfect
humanity
may
become
patriotism
will
always
be
a
virtue
among
oppressed
peoples
because
it
will
at
all
times
mean
love
of
justice
of
liberty
of
personal
dignity
nothing
of
chimerical
dreams
of
effeminate
idyls
the
greatness
of
a
man
is
not
in
living
before
his
time
a
thing
almost
impossible
but
in
understanding
its
desires
in
responding
to
its
needs
and
in
guiding
it
on
its
forward
way
the
geniuses
that
are
commonly
believed
to
have
existed
before
their
time
only
appear
so
because
those
who
judge
them
see
from
a
great
distance
or
take
as
representative
of
the
age
the
line
of
stragglers
simoun
fell
silent
seeing
that
he
could
awake
no
enthusiasm
in
that
unresponsive
mind
he
turned
to
another
subject
and
asked
with
a
change
of
tone
and
what
are
you
doing
for
the
memory
of
your
mother
and
your
brother
is
it
enough
that
you
come
here
every
year
to
weep
like
a
woman
over
a
grave
and
he
smiled
sarcastically
the
shot
hit
the
mark
basilio
changed
color
and
advanced
a
step
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
angrily
without
means
without
social
position
how
may
i
bring
their
murderers
to
justice
i
would
merely
be
another
victim
shattered
like
a
piece
of
glass
hurled
against
a
rock
ah
you
do
ill
to
recall
this
to
me
since
it
is
wantonly
reopening
a
wound
but
what
if
i
should
offer
you
my
aid
basilio
shook
his
head
and
remained
pensive
all
the
tardy
vindications
of
justice
all
the
revenge
in
the
world
will
not
restore
a
single
hair
of
my
mother
head
or
recall
a
smile
to
my
lips
let
them
rest
in
peace
what
should
i
gain
now
by
avenging
them
prevent
others
from
suffering
what
you
have
suffered
that
in
the
future
there
be
no
brothers
murdered
or
mothers
driven
to
madness
resignation
is
not
always
a
virtue
it
is
a
crime
when

by
simoun
who
appeared
to
him
terrible
and
sinister
on
a
background
bathed
in
tears
and
blood
he
tried
to
explain
himself
by
saying
that
he
did
not
consider
himself
fit
to
mix
in
politics
that
he
had
no
political
opinions
because
he
had
never
studied
the
question
but
that
he
was
always
ready
to
lend
his
services

they
might
be

for

he
saw

stopped
him
with

gesture
and
as
the
dawn
was
coming
said
to
him
young
man
i
am
not
warning
you
to
keep
my
secret
because
i
know
that
discretion
is
one
of
your

even
though
you
might

to

me
the

already
suspected
of

being

much
the
more
marked

because
in

you
are
entering

will
encounter
powerful

after

even

thanked
him
briefly
and
went
away
have
i
really
made
a
mistake
mused
simoun
when
he
found
himself
alone
is
it
that
he
doubts
me
and
meditates
his
plan
of
revenge
so
secretly
that
he
fears
to
tell
it
even
in
the
solitude
of
the
night
or
can
it
be
that
the
years
of
servitude
have
extinguished
in
his
heart
every
human
sentiment
and
there
remain
only
the
animal
desires
to
live
and
reproduce
in
that
case
the
type
is
deformed
and
will
have
to
be
cast
over
again
then
the

the
unfit
perish

only
the

survive

he

merry
christmas
when
juli
opened
her
sorrowing
eyes
she
saw
that
the
house
was
still
dark
but
the
cocks
were
crowing
her
first
thought
was
that
perhaps
the
virgin
had
performed
the
miracle
and
the
sun
was
not
going
to
rise
in
spite
of
the
invocations
of
the
cocks
she
rose
crossed
herself
recited
her
morning
prayers
with
great
devotion
and
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
went
out
on
the
there
was
no
miracle
the
sun
was
rising
and
promised
a
magnificent
morning
the
breeze
was
delightfully
cool
the
stars
were
paling
in
the
east
and
the
cocks
were
crowing
as
if
to
see
who
could
crow
best
and
loudest
that
had
been
too
much
to
ask
it
were
much
easier
to
request
the
virgin
to
send
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
what
would
it
cost
the
mother
of
the
lord
to
give
them
but
underneath
the
image
she
found
only
the
letter
of
her
father
asking
for
the
ransom
of
five
hundred
pesos
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
so
seeing
that
her
grandfather
was
not
stirring
she
thought
him
asleep
and
began
to
prepare
breakfast
strange
she
was
calm
she
even
had
a
desire
to
laugh
what
had
she
had
last
night
to
afflict
her
so
she
was
not
going
very
far
she
could
come
every
second
day
to
visit
the
house
her
grandfather
could
see
her
and
as
for
basilio
he
had
known
for
some
time
the
bad
turn
her
father
affairs
had
taken
since
he
had
often
said
to
her
when
i
a
physician
and
we
are
married
your
father
wo
need
his
fields
what
a
fool
i
was
to
cry
so
much
she
said
to
herself
as
she
packed
her
her
fingers
struck
against
the
locket
and
she
pressed
it
to
her
lips
but
immediately
wiped
them
from
fear
of
contagion
for
that
locket
set
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
had
come
from
a
leper
ah
then
if
she
should
catch
that
disease
she
could
not
get
married
as
it
became
lighter
she
could
see
her
grandfather
seated
in
a
corner
following
all
her
movements
with
his
eyes
so
she
caught
up
her
of
clothes
and
approached
him
smilingly
to
kiss
his
hand
the
old
man
blessed
her
silently
while
she
tried
to
appear
merry
when
father
comes
back
tell
him
that
i
have
at
last
gone
to
college
my
mistress
talks
spanish
it
the
cheapest
college
i
could
find
seeing
the
old
man
eyes
fill
with
tears
she
placed
the
on
her
head
and
hastily
went
downstairs
her
slippers
slapping
merrily
on
the
wooden
steps
but
when
she
turned
her
head
to
look
again
at
the
house
the
house
wherein
had
faded
her
childhood
dreams
and
her
maiden
illusions
when
she
saw
it
sad
lonely
deserted
with
the
windows
half
closed
vacant
and
dark
like
a
dead
man
eyes
when
she
heard
the
low
rustling
of
the
bamboos
and
saw
them
nodding
in
the
fresh
morning
breeze
as
though
bidding
her
farewell
then
her
vivacity
disappeared
she
stopped
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
letting
herself
fall
in
a
sitting
posture
on
a
log
by
the
wayside
she
broke
out
into
disconsolate
tears
juli
had
been
gone
several
hours
and
the
sun
was
quite
high
overhead
when
tandang
selo
gazed
from
the
window
at
the
people
in
their
festival
garments
going
to
the
town
to
attend
the
high
mass
nearly
all
led
by
the
hand
or
carried
in
their
arms
a
little
boy
or
girl
decked
out
as
if
for
a
fiesta
christmas
day
in
the
philippines
is
according
to
the
elders
a
fiesta
for
the
children
who
are
perhaps
not
of
the
same
opinion
and
who
it
may
be
supposed
have
for
it
an
instinctive
dread
they
are
roused
early
washed
dressed
and
decked
out
with
everything
new
dear
and
precious
that
they
possess
high
silk
shoes
big
hats
woolen
or
velvet
suits
without
overlooking
four
or
five
scapularies
which
contain
texts
from
john
and
thus
burdened
they
are
carried
to
the
high
mass
where
for
almost
an
hour
they
are
subjected
to
the
heat
and
the
human
smells
from
so
many
crowding
perspiring
people
and
if
they
are
not
made
to
recite
the
rosary
they
must
remain
quiet
bored
or
asleep
at
each
movement
or
antic
that
may
soil
their
clothing
they
are
pinched
and
scolded
so
the
fact
is
that
they
do
not
laugh
or
feel
happy
while
in
their
round
eyes
can
be
read
a
protest
against
so
much
embroidery
and
a
longing
for
the
old
shirt
of
afterwards
they
are
dragged
from
house
to
house
to
kiss
their
relatives
hands
there
they
have
to
dance
sing
and
recite
all
the
amusing
things
they
know
whether
in
the
humor
or
not
whether
comfortable
or
not
in
their
fine
clothes
with
the
eternal
pinchings
and
scoldings
if
they
play
any
of
their
tricks
their
relatives
give
them
cuartos
which
their
parents
seize
upon
and
of
which
they
hear
nothing
more
the
only
positive
results
they
are
accustomed
to
get
from
the
fiesta
are
the
marks
of
the
aforesaid
pinchings
the
vexations
and
at
best
an
attack
of
indigestion
from
gorging
themselves
with
candy
and
cake
in
the
houses
of
kind
relatives
but
such
is
the
custom
and
filipino
children
enter
the
world
through
these
ordeals
which
afterwards
prove
the
least
sad
the
least
hard
of
their
lives
adult
persons
who
live
independently
also
share
in
this
fiesta
by
visiting
their
parents
and
their
parents
relatives
crooking
their
knees
and
wishing
them
a
merry
christmas
their

gift

of
a

some
fruit
a
glass
of
water
or
some
insignificant
present
tandang
selo
saw
all
his
friends
pass
and
thought
sadly
that
this
year
he
had
no
christmas
gift
for
anybody
while
his
granddaughter
had
gone
without
hers
without
wishing
him
a
merry
christinas
was
it
delicacy
on
juli
part
or
pure
forgetfulness
when
he
tried
to
greet
the
relatives
who
called
on
him
bringing
their
children
he
found
to
his
great
surprise
that
he
could
not
articulate
a
word
vainly
he
tried
but
no
sound
could
he
utter
he
placed
his
hands
on
his
throat
shook
his
head
but
without
effect
when
he
tried
to
laugh
his
lips
trembled
convulsively
and
the
only
noise
produced
was
a
hoarse
wheeze
like
the
blowing
of
bellows
the
women
gazed
at
him
in
consternation
he
dumb
he
dumb
they
cried
in
astonishment
raising
at
once
a
literal
pandemonium
chapter
ix
pilates
when
the
news
of
this
misfortune
became
known
in
the
town
some
lamented
it
and
others
shrugged
their
shoulders
no
one
was
to
blame
and
no
one
need
lay
it
on
his
conscience
the
lieutenant
of
the
civil
guard
gave
no
sign
he
had
received
an
order
to
take
up
all
the
arms
and
he
had
performed
his
duty
he
had
chased
the
tulisanes
whenever
he
could
and
when
they
captured
cabesang
tales
he
had
organized
an
expedition
and
brought
into
the
town
with
their
arms
bound
behind
them
five
or
six
rustics
who
looked
suspicious
so
if
cabesang
tales
did
not
show
up
it
was
because
he
was
not
in
the
pockets
or
under
the
skins
of
the
prisoners
who
were
thoroughly
shaken
out
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
a
matter
of
tulisanes
and
he
had
merely
done
his
duty
true
it
was
that
if
he
had
not
entered
the
complaint
perhaps
the
arms
would
not
have
been
taken
up
and
poor
tales
would
not
have
been
captured
but
he
fray
clemente
had
to
look
after
his
own
safety
and
that
tales
had
a
way
of
staring
at
him
as
if
picking
out
a
good
target
in
some
part
of
his
body
is
natural
if
there
are
tulisanes
the
fault
is
not
his
it
is
not
his
duty
to
run
them
down
that
belongs
to
the
civil
guard
if
cabesang
tales
instead
of
wandering
about
his
fields
had
stayed
at
home
he
would
not
have
been
captured
in
short
that
was
a
punishment
from
heaven
upon
those
who
resisted
the
demands
of
his
corporation
when
sister
penchang
the
pious
old
woman
in
whose
service
juli
had
entered
learned
of
it
she
ejaculated
several
crossed
herself
and
remarked
often
god
sends
these
trials
because
we
are
sinners
or
have
sinning
relatives
to
whom
we
should
have
taught
piety
and
we
have
done
so
those
referred
to
juliana
for
to
this
pious
woman
juli
was
a
great
sinner
think
of
a
girl
of
marriageable
age
who
does
yet
know
how
to
pray
how
scandalous
if
the
wretch
does
say
the
te
salve
without
stopping
at
and
the
without
a
pause
after
as
every
good
christian
who
fears
god
ought
to
do
she
does
know
the
and
says
for
anybody
hearing
her
would
think
she
was
talking
about
something
else
greatly
scandalized
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
thanked
god
who
had
permitted
the
capture
of
the
father
in
order
that
the
daughter
might
be
snatched
from
sin
and
learn
the
virtues
which
according
to
the
curates
should
adorn
every
christian
woman
she
therefore
kept
the
girl
constantly
at
work
not
allowing
her
to
return
to
the
village
to
look
after
her
grandfather
juli
had
to
learn
how
to
pray
to
read
the
books
distributed
by
the
friars
and
to
work
until
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pesos
should
be
paid
when
she
learned
that
basilio
had
gone
to
manila
to
get
his
savings
and
ransom
juli
from
her
servitude
the
good
woman
believed
that
the
girl
was
forever
lost
and
that
the
devil
had
presented
himself
in
the
guise
of
the
student
dreadful
as
it
all
was
how
true
was
that
little
book
the
curate
had
given
her
youths
who
go
to
manila
to
study
are
ruined
and
then
ruin
the
others
thinking
to
rescue
juli
she
made
her
read
and
the
book
called
basio
charging
her
always
to
go
and
see
the
curate
in
the
convento
as
did
the
heroine
who
is
so
praised
by
the
author
a
friar
meanwhile
the
friars
had
gained
their
point
they
had
certainly
won
the
suit
so
they
took
advantage
of
cabesang
tales
captivity
to
turn
the
fields
over
to
the
one
who
had
asked
for
them
without
the
least
thought
of
honor
or
the
faintest
twinge
of
shame
when
the
former
owner
returned
and
learned
what
had
happened
when
he
saw
his
fields
in
another
possession
those
fields
that
had
cost
the
lives
of
his
wife
and
daughter
when
he
saw
his
father
dumb
and
his
daughter
working
as
a
servant
and
when
he
himself
received
an
order
from
the
town
council
transmitted
through
the
headman
of
the
village
to
move
out
of
the
house
within
three
days
he
said
nothing
he
sat
down
at
his
father
side
and
spoke
scarcely
once
during
the
whole
day

and

of

who
even
in
the
midst
of
his
wretchedness
did
not
forget
the
good
filipino
customs
rather
he
was
troubled
to
think
that
he
had
no
way
of
properly
entertaining
the
stranger
but
simoun
brought
everything
with
him
servants
and
provisions
and
merely
wished
to
spend
the
day
and
night
in
the
house
because
it
was
the
largest
in
the
village
and
was
situated
between
san
diego
and
tiani
towns
where
he
hoped
to
find
many
customers
simoun
secured
information
about
the
condition
of
the
roads
and
asked
cabesang
tales
if
his
revolver
was
a
sufficient
protection
against
the
tulisanes
they
have
rifles
that
shoot
a
long
way
was
the
rather
reply
this
revolver

no

noticed
that
some
nuts
fell
but
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
gradually
the
families
drawn
by
the
fame
of
the
jeweler
wares
began
to
collect
they
wished
one
another
merry
christmas
they
talked
of
masses
saints
poor
crops
but
still
were
there
to
spend
their
savings
for
jewels
and
trinkets
brought
from
europe
it
was
known
that
the
jeweler
was
the
friend
of
the
so
it
was
lost
labor
to
get
on
good
terms
with
him
and
thus
be
prepared
for
contingencies
capitan
basilio
came
with
his
wife
daughter
and
prepared
to
spend
at
least
three
thousand
pesos
sister
penchang
was
there
to
buy
a
diamond
ring
she
had
promised
to
the
virgin
of
antipolo
she
had
left
juli
at
home
memorizing
a
booklet
the
curate
had
sold
her
for
four
cuartos
with
forty
days
of
indulgence
granted
by
the
archbishop
to
every
one
who
read
it
or
listened
to
it

said
the
pious
woman
to
capitana
tika
that
poor
girl
has
grown
up
like
a
mushroom
planted
by
the
i
made
her
read
the
book
at
the
top
of
her
voice
at
least
fifty
times
and
she
remember
a
single
word
of
it
she
has
a
head
like
a
sieve
full
when
it
in
the
water
all
of
us
hearing
her
even
the
dogs
and
cats
have
won
at
least
twenty
years
of
indulgence
simoun
arranged
his
two
chests
on
the
table
one
being
somewhat
larger
than
the
other
you
do
want
plated
jewelry
or
imitation
gems
this
lady
turning
to
sinang
wants
real
diamonds
that
it
yes
sir
diamonds
old
diamonds
antique
stones
you
know
she
responded
papa
will
pay
for
them
because
he
likes
antique
things
antique
stones
sinang
was
accustomed
to
joke
about
the
great
deal
of
latin
her
father
understood
and
the
little
her
husband
knew
it
just
happens
that
i
have
some
antique
jewels
replied
simoun
taking
the
canvas
cover
from
the
smaller
chest
a
polished
steel
case
with
bronze
trimmings
and
stout
locks
i
have
necklaces
of
cleopatra
real
and
genuine
discovered
in
the
pyramids
rings
of
roman
senators
and
knights
found
in
the
ruins
of
carthage
probably
those
that
hannibal
sent
back
after
the
battle
of
cannae
exclaimed
capitan
basilio
seriously
while
he
trembled
with
pleasure
the
good
man
thought
he
had
read
much
about
the
ancients
had
never
by
reason
of
the
lack
of
museums
in
filipinas
seen
any
of
the
objects
of
those
times
i
have
brought
besides
costly
earrings
of
roman
ladies
discovered
in
the
villa
of
annius
mucius
papilinus
in
pompeii
capitan
easilio
nodded
to
show
that
he
understood
and
was
eager
to
see
such
precious
relics
the
women
remarked
that
they
also
wanted
things
from
rome
such
as
rosaries
blessed
by
the
pope
holy
relics
that
would
take
away
sins
without
the
need
of
confessions
and
so
on
when
the
chest
was
opened
and
the
cotton
packing
removed
there
was
exposed
a
tray
filled
with
rings
reliquaries
lockets
crucifixes
brooches
and
such
like
the
diamonds
set
in
among
variously
colored
stones
flashed
out
brightly
and
shimmered
among
golden
flowers
of
varied
hues
with
petals
of
enamel
all
of
peculiar
designs
and
rare
arabesque
workmanship
simoun
lifted
the
tray
and
exhibited
another
filled
with
quaint
jewels
that
would
have
satisfied
the
imaginations
of
seven
débutantes
on
the
eves
of
the
balls
in
their
honor
designs
one
more
fantastic
than
the
other
combinations
of
precious
stones
and
pearls
worked
into
the
figures
of
insects
with
azure
backs
and
transparent
forewings
sapphires
emeralds
rubies
turquoises
diamonds
joined
to
form
wasps
bees
butterflies
beetles
serpents
lizards
fishes
sprays
of
flowers
there
were
diadems
necklaces
of
pearls
and
diamonds
so
that
some
of
the
girls
could
not
withhold
a
of
admiration
and
sinang
gave
a
cluck
with
her
tongue
whereupon
her
mother
pinched
her
to
prevent
her
from
encouraging
the
jeweler
to
raise
his
prices
for
capitana
tika
still
pinched
her
daughter
even
after
the
latter
was
married
here
you
have
some
old
diamonds
explained
the
jeweler
this
ring
belonged
to
the
princess
lamballe
and
those
earrings
to
one
of
marie
antoinette
ladies
they
consisted
of
some
beautiful
solitaire
diamonds
as
large
as
grains
of
corn
with
somewhat
bluish
lights
and
pervaded
with
a
severe
elegance
as
though
they
still
reflected
in
their
sparkles
the
shuddering
of
the
reign
of
terror
those
two
earrings
exclaimed
sinang
looking
at
her
father
and
instinctively
covering
the
arm
next
to
her
mother
something
more
ancient
yet
something
roman
said
capitan
basilio
with
a
wink
the
pious
sister
penchang
thought
that
with
such
a
gift
the
virgin
of
antipolo
would
be
softened
and
grant
her
her
most
vehement
desire
for
some
time
she
had
begged
for
a
wonderful
miracle
to
which
her
name
would
be
attached
so
that
her
name
might
be
immortalized
on
earth
and
she
then
ascend
into
heaven
like
the
capitana
ines
of
the
curates
she
inquired
the
price
and
simoun
asked
three
thousand
pesos
which
made
the
good
woman
cross
herself
simoun
now
exposed
the
third
tray
which
was
filled
with
watches
and
decorated
with
the
rarest
enamels
reliquaries
set
with
diamonds
and
containing
the
most
elegant
miniatures
the
fourth
tray
containing
loose
gems
stirred
a
murmur
of
admiration
sinang
again
clucked
with
her
tongue
her
mother
again
pinched
her
although
at
the
same
time
herself
emitting
a
of
wonder
no
one
there
had
ever
before
seen
so
much
wealth
in
that
chest
lined
with
velvet
arranged
in
trays
were
the
wonders
of
the
nights
the
dreams
of
oriental
fantasies
diamonds
as
large
as
peas
glittered
there
throwing
out
attractive
rays
as
if
they
were
about
to
melt
or
burn
with
all
the
hues
of
the
spectrum
emeralds
from
peru
of
varied
forms
and
shapes
rubies
from
india
red
as
drops
of
blood
sapphires
from
ceylon
blue
and
white
turquoises
from
persia
oriental
pearls
some
rosy
some
others
black
those
who
have
at
night
seen
a
great
rocket
burst
in
the
azure
darkness
of
the
sky
into
thousands
of
colored
lights
so
bright
that
they
make
the
eternal
stars
look
dim
can
imagine
the
aspect
the
tray
presented
as
if
to
increase
the
admiration
of
the
beholders
simoun
took
the
stones
out
with
his
tapering
brown
fingers
gloating
over
their
crystalline
hardness
their
luminous
stream
as
they
poured
from
his
hands
like
drops
of
water
reflecting
the
tints
of
the
rainbow
the
reflections
from
so
many
facets
the
thought
of
their
great
value
fascinated
the
gaze
of
every
one
cabesang
tales
who
had
approached
out
of
curiosity
closed
his
eyes
and
drew
back
hurriedly
as
if
to
drive
away
an
evil
thought
such
great
riches
were
an
insult
to
his
misfortunes
that
man
had
come
there
to
make
an
exhibition
of
his
immense
wealth
on
the
very
day
that
he
tales
for
lack
of
money
for
lack
of
protectors
had
to
abandon
the
house
raised
by
his
own
hands
here
you
have
two
black
diamonds
among
the
largest
in
existence
explained
the
jeweler
they
very
difficult
to
cut
because
the
very
hardest
this
somewhat
rosy
stone
is
also
a
diamond
as
is
this
green
one
that
many
take
for
an
emerald
quiroga
the
chinaman
offered
me
six
thousand
pesos
for
it
in
order
to
present
it
to
a
very
influential
lady
and
yet
it
is
not
the
green
ones
that
are
the
most
valuable
but
these
blue
ones
he
selected
three
stones
of
no
great
size
but
thick
and
of
a
delicate
azure
tint
for
all
that
they
are
smaller
than
the
green
he
continued
they
cost
twice
as
much
look
at
this
one
the
smallest
of
all
weighing
not
more
than
two
carats
which
cost
me
twenty
thousand
pesos
and
which
i
wo
sell
for
less
than
thirty
i
had
to
make
a
special
trip
to
buy
it
this
other
one
from
the
mines
of
golconda
weighs
three
and
a
half
carats
and
is
worth
over
seventy
thousand
the
viceroy
of
india
in
a
letter
i
received
the
day
before
yesterday
offers
me
twelve
thousand
pounds
sterling
for
it
before
such
great
wealth
all
under
the
power
of
that
man
who
talked
so
unaffectedly
the
spectators
felt
a
kind
of
awe
mingled
with
dread
sinang
clucked
several
times
and
her
mother
did
not
pinch
her
perhaps
because
she
too
was
overcome
or
perhaps
because
she
reflected
that
a
jeweler
like
simoun
was
not
going
to
try
to
gain
five
pesos
more
or
less
as
a
result
of
an
exclamation
more
or
less
indiscreet
all
gazed
at
the
gems
but
no
one
showed
any
desire
to
handle
them
they
were
so
curiosity
was
blunted
by
wonder
cabesang
tales
stared
out
into
the
field
thinking
that
with
a
single
diamond
perhaps
the
very
smallest
there
he
could
recover
his
daughter
keep
his
house
and
perhaps
rent
another
farm
could
it
be
that
those
gems
were
worth
more
than
a
man
home
the
safety
of
a
maiden
the
peace
of
an
old
man
in
his
declining
days
as
if
he
guessed
the
thought
simoun
remarked
to
those
about
him
look
here
with
one
of
these
little
blue
stones
which
appear
so
innocent
and
inoffensive
pure
as
sparks
scattered
over
the
arch
of
heaven
with
one
of
these
seasonably
presented
a
man
was
able
to
have
his
enemy
deported
the
father
of
a
family
as
a
disturber
of
the
peace
and
with
this
other
little
one
like
it
red
as
one
as
the
feeling
of
revenge
and
bright
as
an
orphan
tears
he
was
restored
to
liberty
the
man
was
returned
to
his
home
the
father
to
his
children
the
husband
to
the
wife
and
a
whole
family
saved
from
a
wretched
future
he
slapped
the
chest
and
went
on
in
a
loud
tone
in
bad
tagalog
here
i
have
as
in
a
life
and
death
poison
and
balm
and
with
this
handful
i
can
drive
to
tears
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
philippines
the
listeners
gazed
at
him
knowing
him
to
be
right
in
his
voice
there
could
be
detected
a
strange
ring
while
sinister
flashes
seemed
to
issue
from
behind
the
blue
goggles
then
as
if
to
relieve
the
strain
of
the
impression
made
by
the
gems
on
such
simple
folk
he
lifted
up
the
tray
and
exposed
at
the
bottom
the
cases
of
russian
leather
separated
by
layers
of
cotton
covered
a
bottom
lined
with
gray
velvet
all
expected
wonders
and
sinang
husband
thought
he
saw
carbuncles
gems
that
flashed
fire
and
shone
in
the
midst
of
the
shadows
capitan
basilio
was
on
the
threshold
of
immortality
he
was
going
to
behold
something
real
something
beyond
his
dreams
this
was
a
necklace
of
cleopatra
said
simoun
taking
out
carefully
a
flat
case
in
the
shape
of
a
it
a
jewel
that
ca
be
appraised
an
object
for
a
museum
only
for
a
rich
government
it
was
a
necklace
fashioned
of
bits
of
gold
representing
little
idols
among
green
and
blue
beetles
with
a
vulture
head
made
from
a
single
piece
of
rare
jasper
at
the
center
between
two
extended
wings
the
symbol
and
decoration
of
egyptian
queens
sinang
turned
up
her
nose
and
made
a
grimace
of
childish
depreciation
while
capitan
basilio
with
all
his
love
for
antiquity
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
of
disappointment
it
a
magnificent
jewel
almost
two
thousand
years
old
pshaw
sinang
made
haste
to
exclaim
to
prevent
her
father
falling
into
temptation
fool
he
chided
her
after
overcoming
his
first
disappointment
how
do
you
know
but
that
to
this
necklace
is
due
the
present
condition
of
the
world
with
this
cleopatra
may
have
captivated
caesar
mark
antony
this
has
heard
the
burning
declarations
of
love
from
the
greatest
warriors
of
their
time
it
has
listened
to
speeches
in
the
purest
and
most
elegant
latin
and
yet
you
would
want
to
wear
it
i
i
would
give
three
pesos
for
it
you
could
give
twenty
silly
said
capitana
tika
in
a
judicial
tone
the
gold
is
good
and
melted
down
would
serve
for
other
jewelry
this
is
a
ring
that
must
have
belonged
to
sulla
continued
simoun
exhibiting
a
heavy
ring
of
solid
gold
with
a
seal
on
it
with
that
he
must
have
signed
the
during
his
dictatorship
exclaimed
capitan
basilio
pale
with
emotion
he
examined
it
and
tried
to
decipher
the
seal
but
though
he
turned
it
over
and
over
he
did
not
understand
paleography
so
he
could
not
read
it
what
a
finger
sulla
had
he
observed
finally
this
would
fit
two
of
ours
as
i
said
we
degenerating
i
still
have
many
other
jewels
if
they
all

he
asked
cabesang
tales
noticing
the
latter
watching
the
sales
and
exchanges
with
covetous
eyes
but
the
reply
was
that
all
his
daughter
jewels
had
been
sold
nothing
of
value
remained
what
about
maria
clara
locket
inquired
sinang
true
the
man
exclaimed
and
his
eyes
blazed
for
a
moment
it
a
locket
set
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
sinang
told
the
jeweler
my
old
friend
wore
it
before
she
became
a
nun
simoun
said
nothing
but
anxiously
watched
cabesang
tales
who
after
opening
several
boxes
found
the
locket
he
examined
it
carefully
opening
and
shutting
it
repeatedly
it
was
the
same
locket
that
maria
clara
had
worn
during
the
fiesta
in
san
diego
and
which
she
had
in
a
moment
of
compassion
given
to
a
leper
i
like
the
design
said
simoun
how
much
do
you
want
for
it
cabesang
tales
scratched
his
head
in
perplexity
then
his
ear
then
looked
at
the
women
i
taken
a
fancy
to
this
locket
simoun
went
on
will
you
take
a
hundred
five
hundred
pesos
do
you
want
to
exchange
it
for
something
else
take
your
choice
here
tales
stared
foolishly
at
simoun
as
if
in
doubt
of
what
he
heard
five
hundred
pesos
he
murmured
five
hundred
repeated
the
jeweler
in
a
voice
shaking
with
emotion
cabesang
tales
took
the
locket
and
made
several
turns
about
the
room
with
his
heart
beating
violently
and
his
hands
trembling
dared
he
ask
more
that
locket
could
save
him
this
was
an
excellent
opportunity
such
as
might
not
again
present
itself
the
women
winked
at
him
to
encourage
him
to
make
the
sale
excepting
penchang
who
fearing
that
juli
would
be
ransomed
observed
piously
i
would
keep
it
as
a
relic
those
who
have
seen
maria
clara
in
the
nunnery
say
she
has
got
so
thin
and
weak
that
she
can
scarcely
talk
and
it
thought
that
she
die
a
saint
padre
salvi
speaks
very
highly
of
her
and
he
her
confessor
that
why
juli
did
want
ito
give
it
up
but
rather
preferred
to
pawn
herself
this
speech
had
its
effect
the
thought
of
his
daughter
restrained
tales
if
you
will
allow
me
he
said
i
go
to
the
town
to
consult
my
daughter
i
be
back
before
night
this
was
agreed
upon
and
tales
set
out
at
once
but
when
he
found
himself
outside
of
the
village
he
made
out
at
a
distance
on
a
path
that
entered
the
woods
the
and
a
man
whom
he
recognized
as
the
usurper
of
his
land
a
husband
seeing
his
wife
enter
a
private
room
with
another
man
could
not
feel
more
wrath
or
jealousy
than
cabesang
tales
experienced
when
he
saw
them
moving
over
his
fields
the
fields
cleared
by
him
which
he
had
thought
to
leave
to
his
children
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
mocking
him
laughing
at
his
powerlessness
there
flashed
into
his
memory
what
he
had
said
about
never
giving
up
his
fields
except
to
him
who
irrigated
them
with
his
own
blood
and
buried
in
them
his
wife
and
daughter
he
stopped
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
and
shut
his
eyes
when
he
again
opened
them
he
saw
that
the
man
had
turned
to
laugh
and
that
the
friar
had
caught
his
sides
as
though
to
save
himself
from
bursting
with
merriment
then
he
saw
them
point
toward
his
house
and
laugh
again
a
buzz
sounded
in
his
ears
he
felt
the
crack
of
a
whip
around
his
chest
the
red
mist
reappeared
before
his
eyes
he
again
saw
the
corpses
of
his
wife
and
daughter
and
beside
them
the
usurper
with
the
friar
laughing
and
holding
his
sides
forgetting
everything
else
he
turned
aside
into
the
path
they
had
taken
the
one
leading
to
his
fields
simoun
waited
in
vain
for
cabesang
tales
to
return
that
night
but
the
next
morning
when
he
arose
he
noticed
that
the
leather
holster
of
his
revolver
was
empty
opening
it
he
found
inside
a
scrap
of
paper
wrapped
around
the
locket
set
with
emeralds
and
diamonds
with
these
few
lines
written
on
it
in
tagalog

chapter
xi
los
baños
his
excellency
the
and
governor
of
the
philippine
islands
had
been
hunting
in
bosoboso
but
as
he
had
to
be
accompanied
by
a
band
of
music
since
such
an
exalted
personage
was
not
to
be
esteemed
less
than
the
wooden
images
carried
in
the
processions
and
as
devotion
to
the
divine
art
of
cecilia
has
not
yet
been
popularized
among
the
deer
and
wild
boars
of
bosoboso
his
excellency
with
the
band
of
music
and
train
of
friars
soldiers
and
clerks
had
not
been
able
to
catch
a
single
rat
or
a
solitary
bird
the
provincial
authorities
foresaw
dismissals
and
transfers
the
poor
gobernadorcillos
and
cabezas
de
barangay
were
restless
and
sleepless
fearing
that
the
mighty
hunter
in
his
wrath
might
have
a
notion
to
make
up
with
their
persons
for
the
lack
of
submissiveness
on
the
part
of
the
beasts
of
the
forest
as
had
been
done
years
before
by
an
alcalde
who
had
traveled
on
the
shoulders
of
impressed
porters
because
he
found
no
horses
gentle
enough
to
guarantee
his
safety
there
was
not
lacking
an
evil
rumor
that
his
excellency
had
decided
to
take
some
action
since
in
this
he
saw
the
first
symptoms
of
a
rebellion
which
should
be
strangled
in
its
infancy
that
a
fruitless
hunt
hurt
the
prestige
of
the
spanish
name
that
he
already
had
his
eye
on
a
wretch
to
be
dressed
up
as
a
deer
when
his
excellency
with
clemency
that
lacked
words
to
extol
sufficiently
dispelled
all
the
fears
by
declaring
that
it
pained
him
to
sacrifice
to
his
pleasure
the
beasts
of
the
forest
but
to
tell
the
truth
his
excellency
was
secretly
very
well
satisfied
for
what
would
have
happened
had
he
missed
a
shot
at
a
deer
one
of
those
not
familiar
with
political
etiquette
what
would
the
prestige
of
the
sovereign
power
have
come
to
then
a
of
the
philippines
missing
a
shot
like
a
raw
hunter
what
would
have
been
said
by
the
indians
among
whom
there
were
some
fair
huntsmen
the
integrity
of
the
fatherland
would
have
been
endangered
so
it
was
that
his
excellency
with
a
sheepish
smile
and
posing
as
a
disappointed
hunter
ordered
an
immediate
return
to
los
baños
during
the
journey
he
related
with
an
indifferent
air
his
hunting
exploits
in
this
or
that
forest
of
the
peninsula
adopting
a
tone
somewhat
depreciative
as
suited
the
case
toward
hunting
in
filipinas
the
bath
in
dampalit
the
hot
springs
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
in
the
palace
with
an
occasional
excursion
to
some
neighboring
waterfall
or
the
lake
infested
with
caymans
offered
more
attractions
and
fewer
risks
to
the
integrity
of
the
fatherland
thus
on
one
of
the
last
days
of
december
his
excellency
found
himself
in
the
sala
taking
a
hand
at
cards
while
he
awaited
the
breakfast
hour
he
had
come
from
the
bath
with
the
usual
glass
of
and
its
soft
meat
so
he
was
in
the
best
of
humors
for
granting
favors
and
privileges
his
good
humor
was
increased
by
his
winning
a
good
many
hands
for
padre
irene
and
padre
sibyla
with
whom
he
was
playing
were
exercising
all
their
skill
in
secretly
trying
to
lose
to
the
great
irritation
of
padre
camorra
who
on
account
of
his
late
arrival
only
that
morning
was
not
informed
as
to
the
game
they
were
playing
on
the
general
the
was
playing
in
good
faith
and
with
great
care
so
he
turned
red
and
bit
his
lip
every
time
padre
sibyla
seemed
inattentive
or
blundered
but
he
dared
not
say
a
word
by
reason
of
the
respect
he
felt
for
the
dominican
in
exchange
he
took
his
revenge
out
on
padre
irene
whom
he
looked
upon
as
a
base
fawner
and
despised
for
his
coarseness
padre
sibyla
let
him
scold
while
the
humbler
padre
irene
tried
to
excuse
himself
by
rubbing
his
long
nose
his
excellency
was
enjoying
it
and
took
advantage
like
the
good
tactician
that
the
canon
hinted
he
was
of
all
the
mistakes
of
his
opponents
padre
camorra
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
across
the
table
they
were
playing
for
the
intellectual
development
of
the
filipinos
the
instruction
in
castilian
but
had
he
known
it
he
would
doubtless
have
joyfully
entered
into
that
the
open
balcony
admitted
the
fresh
pure
breeze
and
revealed
the
lake
whose
waters
murmured
sweetly
around
the
base
of
the
edifice
as
if
rendering
homage
on
the
right
at
a
distance
appeared
talim
island
a
deep
blue
in
the
midst
of
the
lake
while
almost
in
front
lay
the
green
and
deserted
islet
of
kalamba
in
the
shape
of
a
to
the
left
the
picturesque
shores
were
fringed
with
clumps
of
bamboo
then
a
hill
overlooking
the
lake
with
wide
ricefields
beyond
then
red
roofs
amid
the
deep
green
of
the
trees
the
town
of
kalamba
and
beyond
the
fading
into
the
distance
with
the
horizon
at
the
back
closing
down
over
the
water
giving
the
lake
the
appearance
of
a
sea
and
justifying
the
name
the
indians
give
it
of
na
or
sea
at
the
end
of
the
sala
seated
before
a
table
covered
with
documents
was
the
secretary
his
excellency
was
a
great
worker
and
did
not
like
to
lose
time
so
he
attended
to
business
in
the
intervals
of
the
game
or
while
dealing
the
cards
meanwhile
the
bored
secretary
yawned
and
despaired
that
morning
he
had
worked
as
usual
over
transfers
suspensions
of
employees
deportations
pardons
and
the
like
but
had
not
yet
touched
the
great
question
that
had
stirred
so
much
interest
the
petition
of
the
students
requesting
permission
to
establish
an
academy
of
castilian
pacing
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
conversing
animatedly
but
in
low
tones
were
to
be
seen
don
custodio
a
high
official
and
a
friar
named
padre
fernandez
who
hung
his
head
with
an
air
either
of
meditation
or
annoyance
from
an
adjoining
room
issued
the
click
of
balls
striking
together
and
bursts
of
laughter
amid
which
might
be
heard
the
sharp
dry
voice
of
simoun
who
was
playing
billiards
with
suddenly
padre
camorra
arose
the
devil
with
this
game
he
exclaimed
throwing
his
cards
at
padre
irene
head
that
trick
if
not
all
the
others
was
assured
and
we
lost
by
default
the
devil
with
this
game
he
explained
the
situation
angrily
to
all
the
occupants
of
the
sala
addressing
himself
especially
to
the
three
walking
about
as
if
he
had
selected
them
for
judges
the
general
played
thus
he
replied
with
such
a
card
padre
irene
had
a
certain
card
he
led
and
then
that
fool
of
a
padre
irene
did
play
his
card
padre
irene
was
giving
the
game
away
it
was
a
devil
of
a
way
to
play
his
mother
son
had
not
come
here
to
rack
his
brains
for
nothing
and
lose
his
money
then
he
added
turning
very
red
if
the
booby
thinks
my
money
grows
on
every
bush
on
top
of
the
fact
that
my
indians
are
beginning
to
haggle
over
payments
fuming
and
disregarding
the
excuses
of
padre
irene
who
tried
to
explain
while
he
rubbed
the
tip
of
his
beak
in
order
to
conceal
his
sly
smile
he
went
into
the
billiardroom
padre
fernandez
would
you
like
to
take
a
hand
asked
fray
sibyla
i
a
very
poor
player
replied
the
friar
with
a
grimace
then
get
simoun
said
the
general
eh
simoun
eh
mister
you
try
a
hand
what
is
your
disposition
concerning
the
arms
for
sporting
purposes
asked
the
secretary
taking
advantage
of
the
pause
simoun
thrust
his
head
through
the
doorway
do
you
want
to
take
padre
camorra
place
señor
sindbad
inquired
padre
irene
you
can
bet
diamonds
instead
of
chips
i
do
care
if
i
do
replied
simoun
advancing
while
he
brushed
the
chalk
from
his
hands
what
will
you
bet
what
should
we
bet
returned
padre
sibyla
the
general
can
bet
what
he
likes
but
we
priests
clerics
bah
interrupted
simoun
ironically
you
and
padre
irene
can
pay
with
deeds
of
charity
prayers
and
virtues
eh
you
know
that
the
virtues
a
person
may
possess
gravely
argued
padre
sibyla
are
not
like
the
diamonds
that
may
pass
from
hand
to
hand
to
be
sold
and
resold
they
are
inherent
in
the
being
they
are
essential
attributes
of
the
subject
i
be
satisfied
then
if
you
pay
me
with
promises
replied
simoun
jestingly
you
padre
sibyla
instead
of
paying
me
five
something
or
other
in
money
will
say
for
example
for
five
days
i
renounce
poverty
humility
and
obedience
you
padre
irene
i
renounce
chastity
liberality
and
so
on
those
are
small
matters
and
putting
up
my
diamonds
what
a
peculiar
man
this
simoun
is
what
notions
he
has
exclaimed
padre
irene
with
a
smile
and
continued
simoun
slapping
his
excellency
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
he
will
pay
me
with
an
order
for
five
days
in
prison
or
five
months
or
an
order
of
deportation
made
out
in
blank
or
let
us
say
a
summary
execution
by
the
civil
guard
while
my
man
is
being
conducted
from
one
town
to
another
this
was
a
strange
proposition
so
the
three
who
had
been
pacing
about
gathered
around
but
señor
simoun
asked
the
high
official
what
good
will
you
get
out
of
winning
promises
of
virtues
or
lives
and
deportations
and
summary
executions
a
great
deal
i
tired
of
hearing
virtues
talked
about
and
would
like
to
have
the
whole
of
them
all
there
are
in
the
world
tied
up
in
a
sack
in
order
to
throw
them
into
the
sea
even
though
i
had
to
use
my
diamonds
for
sinkers
what
an
idea
exclaimed
padre
irene
with
another
smile
and
the
deportations
and
executions
what
of
them
well
to
clean
the
country
and
destroy
every
evil
seed
get
out
you
still
sore
at
the
tulisanes
but
you
were
lucky
that
they
did
demand
a
larger
ransom
or
keep
all
your
jewels
man
do
be
ungrateful
simoun
proceeded
to
relate
how
he
had
been
intercepted
by
a
band
of
tulisanes
who
after
entertaining
him
for
a
day
had
let
him
go
on
his
way
without
exacting
other
ransom
than
his
two
fine
revolvers
and
the
two
boxes
of
cartridges
he
carried
with
him
he
added
that
the
tulisanes
had
charged
him
with
many
kind
regards
for
his
excellency
the
as
a
result
of
this
and
as
simoun
reported
that
the
tulisanes
were
well
provided
with
shotguns
rifles
and
revolvers
and
against
such
persons
one
man
alone
no
matter
how
well
armed
could
not
defend
himself
his
excellency
to
prevent
the
tulisanes
from
getting
weapons
in
the
future
was
about
to
dictate
a
new
decree
forbidding
the
introduction
of
sporting
arms
on
the
contrary
on
the
contrary
protested
simoun
for
me
the
tulisanes
are
the
most
respectable
men
in
the
country
they
the
only
ones
who
earn
their
living
honestly
suppose
i
had
fallen
into
the
hands
well
of
you
yourselves
for
example
would
you
have
let
me
escape
without
taking
half
of
my
jewels
at
least
don
custodio
was
on
the
point
of
protesting
that
simoun
was
really
a
rude
american
mulatto
taking
advantage
of
his
friendship
with
the
to
insult
padre
irene
although
it
may
be
true
also
that
padre
irene
would
hardly
have
set
him
free
for
so
little
the
evil
is
not
went
on
simoun
in
that
there
are
tulisanes
in
the
mountains
and
uninhabited
parts
the
evil
lies
in
the
tulisanes
in
the
towns
and
cities
like
yourself
put
in
the
canon
with
a
smile
yes
like
myself
like
all
of
us
let
be
frank
for
no
indian
is
listening
to
us
here
continued
the
jeweler
the
evil
is
that
we
not
all
openly
declared
tulisanes
when
that
happens
and
we
all
take
to
the
woods
on
that
day
the
country
will
be
saved
on
that
day
will
rise
a
new
social
order
which
will
take
care
of
itself
and
his
excellency
will
be
able
to
play
his
game
in
peace
without
the
necessity
of
having
his
attention
diverted
by
his
secretary
the
person
mentioned
at
that
moment
yawned
extending
his
folded
arms
above
his
head
and
stretching
his
crossed
legs
under
the
table
as
far
as
possible
upon
noticing
which
all
laughed
his
excellency
wished
to
change
the
course
of
the
conversation
so
throwing
down
the
cards
he
had
been
shuffling
he
said
half
seriously
come
come
enough
of
jokes
and
cards
let
get
to
work
to
work
in
earnest
since
we
still
have
a
before
breakfast
are
there
many
matters
to
be
got
through
with
all
now
gave
their
attention
that
was
the
day
for
joining
battle
over
the
question
of
instruction
in
castilian
for
which
purpose
padre
sibyla
and
padre
irene
had
been
there
several
days
it
was
known
that
the
former
as
was
opposed
to
the
project
and
that
the
latter
supported
it
and
his
activity
was
in
turn
supported
by
the
countess
what
is
there
what
is
there
asked
his
excellency
impatiently
the
petition
about
sporting
arms
replied
the
secretary
with
a
stifled
yawn
forbidden
pardon
general
said
the
high
official
gravely
your
excellency
will
permit
me
to
invite
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
use
of
sporting
arms
is
permitted
in
all
the
countries
of
the
world
the
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
remarked
dryly
we
are
not
imitating
any
nation
in
the
world
between
his
excellency
and
the
high
official
there
was
always
a
difference
of
opinion
so
it
was
sufficient
that
the
latter
offer
any
suggestion
whatsoever
to
have
the
former
remain
stubborn
the
high
official
tried
another
tack
sporting
arms
can
harm
only
rats
and
chickens
they
say
but
are
we
chickens
interrupted
the
general
again
shrugging
his
shoulders
am
i
i
demonstrated
that
i
not
but
there
another
thing
observed
the
secretary
four
months
ago
when
the
possession
of
arms
was
prohibited
the
foreign
importers
were
assured
that
sporting
arms
would
be
admitted
his
excellency
knitted
his
brows
that
can
be
arranged
suggested
simoun
how
very
simply
sporting
arms
nearly
all
have
a
caliber
of
six
millimeters
at
least
those
now
in
the
market
authorize
only
the
sale
of
those
that
have
these
six
millimeters
all
approved
this
idea
of
simoun
except
the
high
official
who
muttered
into
padre
fernandez
ear
that
this
was
not
dignified
nor
was
it
the
way
to
govern
the
schoolmaster
of
tiani
proceeded
the
secretary
shuffling
some
papers
about
asks
for
a
better
location
for
what
better
location
can
he
want
than
the
storehouse
that
he
has
all
to
himself
interrupted
padre
camorra
who
had
returned
having
forgotten
about
the
he
says
that
it
roofless
replied
the
secretary
and
that
having
purchased
out
of
his
own
pocket
some
maps
and
pictures
he
want
to
expose
them
to
the
weather
but
i
have
anything
to
do
with
that
muttered
his
excellency
he
should
address
the
head
secretary
the
governor
of
the
province
or
the
nuncio
i
want
to
tell
you
declared
padre
camorra
that
this
little
schoolmaster
is
a
discontented
filibuster
just
imagine
the
heretic
teaches
that
corpses
rot
just
the
same
whether
buried
with
great
pomp
or
without
any
some
day
i
going
to
punch
him
here
he
doubled
up
his
fists
to
tell
the
truth
observed
padre
sibyla
as
if
speaking
only
to
padre
irene
he
who
wishes
to
teach
teaches
everywhere
in
the
open
air
socrates
taught
in
the
public
streets
plato
in
the
gardens
of
the
academy
even
christ
among
the
mountains
and
lakes
i
heard
several
complaints
against
this
schoolmaster
said
his
excellency
exchanging
a
glance
with
simoun
i
think
the
best
thing
would
be
to
suspend
him
suspended
repeated
the
secretary
the
luck
of
that
unfortunate
who
had
asked
for
help
and
received
his
dismissal
pained
the
high
official
and
he
tried
to
do
something
for
him
it
certain
he
insinuated
rather
timidly
that
education
is
not
at
all
well
provided
for
i
already
decreed
large
sums
for
the
purchase
of
supplies
exclaimed
his
excellency
haughtily
as
if
to
say
i
done
more
than
i
ought
to
have
done
but
since
suitable
locations
are
lacking
the
supplies
purchased
get
ruined
everything
ca
be
done
at
once
said
his
excellency
dryly
the
schoolmasters
here
are
doing
wrong
in
asking
for
buildings
when
those
in
spain
starve
to
death
it
great
presumption
to
be
better
off
here
than
in
the
mother
country
itself
filibusterism
before
everything
the
fatherland
before
everything
else
we
are
spaniards
added
his
eyes
glowing
with
patriotism
but
he
blushed
somewhat
when
he
noticed
that
he
was
speaking
alone
in
the
future
decided
the
general
all
who
complain
will
be
suspended
if
my
project
were
accepted
don
custodio
ventured
to
remark
as
if
talking
to
himself
for
the
construction
of
schoolhouses
it
simple
practical
economical
and
like
all
my
projects
derived
from
long
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
country
the
towns
would
have
schools
without
costing
the
government
a
cuarto
that
easy
observed
the
secretary
sarcastically
compel
the
towns
to
construct
them
at
their
own
expense
whereupon
all
laughed
no
sir
no
sir
cried
the
exasperated
don
custodio
turning
very
red
the
buildings
are
already
constructed
and
only
wait
to
be
utilized
hygienic
unsurpassable
spacious
the
friars
looked
at
one
another
uneasily
would
don
custodio
propose
that
the
churches
and
conventos
be
converted
into
schoolhouses
let
hear
it
said
the
general
with
a
frown
well
general
it
very
simple
replied
don
custodio
drawing
himself
up
and
assuming
his
hollow
voice
of
ceremony
the
schools
are
open
only
on
and
the
cockpits
on
holidays
then
convert
these
into
schoolhouses
at
least
during
the
week
man
man
man
what
a
lovely
idea
what
the
matter
with
you
don
custodio
that
a
grand
suggestion
that
beats
them
all
but
gentlemen
cried
don
custodio
in
answer
to
so
many
exclamations
let
be
practical
what
places
are
more
suitable
than
the
cockpits
they
large
well
constructed
and
under
a
curse
for
the
use
to
which
they
are
put
during
the
from
a
moral
standpoint
my
project
would
be
acceptable
by
serving
as
a
kind
of
expiation
and
weekly
purification
of
the
temple
of
chance
as
we
might
say
but
the
fact
remains
that
sometimes
there
are
cockfights
during
the
week
objected
padre
camorra
and
it
would
be
right
when
the
contractors
of
the
cockpits
pay
the
government
well
on
those
days
close
the
school
man
man
exclaimed
the
scandalized
such
an
outrage
shall
never
be
perpetrated
while
i
govern
to
close
the
schools
in
order
to
gamble
man
man
i
resign
first
his
excellency
was
really
horrified
but
general
it
better
to
close
them
for
a
few
days
than
for
months
it
would
be
immoral
observed
padre
irene
more
indignant
even
than
his
excellency
it
more
immoral
that
vice
has
good
buildings
and
learning
none
let
be
practical
gentlemen
and
not
be
carried
away
by
sentiment
in
politics
there
nothing
worse
than
sentiment
while
from
humane
considerations
we
forbid
the
cultivation
of
opium
in
our
colonies
we
tolerate
the
smoking
of
it
and
the
result
is
that
we
do
not
combat
the
vice
but
impoverish
ourselves
but
remember
that
it
yields
to
the
government
without
any
effort
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pesos
objected
padre
irene
who
was
getting
more
and
more
on
the
governmental
side
enough
enough
enough
exclaimed
his
excellency
to
end
the
discussion
i
have
my
own
plans
in
this
regard
and
will
devote
special
attention
to
the
matter
of
public
instruction
is
there
anything
else
the
secretary
looked
uneasily
toward
padre
sibyla
and
padre
irene
the
cat
was
about
to
come
out
of
the
bag
both
prepared
themselves
the
petition
of
the
students
requesting
authorization
to
open
an
academy
of
castilian
answered
the
secretary
a
general
movement
was
noted
among
those
in
the
room
after
glancing
at
one
another
they
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
general
to
learn
what
his
disposition
would
be
for
six
months
the
petition
had
lain
there
awaiting
a
decision
and
had
become
converted
into
a
kind
of
in
certain
circles
his
excellency
had
lowered
his
eyes
as
if
to
keep
his
thoughts
from
being
read
the
silence
became
embarrassing
as
the
general
understood
so
he
asked
the
high
official
what
do
you
think
what
should
i
think
general
responded
the
person
addressed
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
a
bitter
smile
what
should
i
think
but
that
the
petition
is
just
very
just
and
that
i
am
surprised
that
six
months
should
have
been
taken
to
consider
it
the
fact
is
that
it
involves
other
considerations
said
padre
sibyla
coldly
as
he
half
closed
his
eyes
the
high
official
again
shrugged
his
shoulders
like
one
who
did
not
comprehend
what
those
considerations
could
be
besides
the
intemperateness
of
the
demand
went
on
the
dominican
besides
the
fact
that
it
is
in
the
nature
of
an
infringement
on
our
prerogatives
padre
sibyla
dared
not
go
on
but
looked
at
simoun
the
petition
has
a
somewhat
suspicious
character
corroborated
that
individual
exchanging
a
look
with
the
dominican
who
winked
several
times
padre
irene
noticed
these
things
and
realized
that
his
cause
was
almost
lost
simoun
was
against
him
it
a
peaceful
rebellion
a
revolution
on
stamped
paper
added
padre
sibyla
revolution
rebellion
inquired
the
high
official
staring
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
he
did
not
understand
what
they
could
mean
it
headed
by
some
young
men
charged
with
being
too
radical
and
too
much
interested
in
reforms
not
to
use
stronger
terms
remarked
the
secretary
with
a
look
at
the
dominican
among
them
is
a
certain
isagani
a
poorly
balanced
head
nephew
of
a
native
priest
he
a
pupil
of
mine
put
in
padre
fernandez
and
i
much
pleased
with
him
i
like
your
taste
exclaimed
padre
camorra
on
the
steamer
we
nearly
had
a
fight
he
so
insolent
that
when
i
gave
him
a
shove
aside
he
returned
it
there
also
one
makaragui
or
makarai
makaraig
padre
irene
joined
in
a
very
pleasant
and
agreeable
young
man
then
he
murmured
into
the
general
ear
he
the
one
i
talked
to
you
about
he
very
rich
the
countess
recommends
him
strongly
ah
a
medical
student
one
basilio
of
that
basilio
i
say
nothing
observed
padre
irene
raising
his
hands
and
opening
them
as
if
to
say
too
deep
for
me
i
never
succeeded
in
fathoming
what
he
wants
or
what
he
is
thinking
about
it
a
pity
that
padre
salvi
is
present
to
tell
us
something
about
his
antecedents
i
believe
that
i
heard
that
when
a
boy
he
got
into
trouble
with
the
civil
guard
his
father
was
killed
in
i
do
remember
what
disturbance
simoun
smiled
faintly
silently
showing
his
sharp
white
teeth
aha
aha
said
his
excellency
nodding
that
the
kind
we
have
make
a
note
of
that
name
but
general
objected
the
high
official
seeing
that
the
matter
was
taking
a
bad
turn
up
to
now
nothing
positive
is
known
against
these
young
men
their
position
is
a
very
just
one
and
we
have
no
right
to
deny
it
on
the
ground
of
mere
conjectures
my
opinion
is
that
the
government
by
exhibiting
confidence
in
the
people
and
in
its
own
stability
should
grant
what
is
asked
then
it
could
freely
revoke
the
permission
when
it
saw
that
its
kindness
was
being
abused
reasons
and
pretexts
would
not
be
wanting
we
can
watch
them
why
cause
disaffection
among
some
young
men
who
later
on
may
feel
resentment
when
what
they
ask
is
commanded
by
royal
decrees
padre
irene
don
custodio
and
padre
fernandez
nodded
in
agreement
but
the
indians
must
not
understand
castilian
you
know
cried
padre
camorra
they
must
learn
it
for
then
they
enter
into
arguments
with
us
and
the
indians
must
not
argue
but
obey
and
pay
they
try
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
laws
and
the
books
they
so
tricky
and
pettifogish
just
as
soon
as
they
learn
castilian
they
become
enemies
of
god
and
of
spain
just
read
the
basio
that
a
book
it
tells
truths
like
this
and
he
held
up
his
clenched
fists
padre
sibyla
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
tonsure
in
sign
of
impatience
one
word
he
began
in
the
most
conciliatory
tone
though
fuming
with
irritation
here
we
not
dealing
with
the
instruction
in
castilian
alone
here
there
is
an
underhand
fight
between
the
students
and
the
university
of
santo
tomas
if
the
students
win
this
our
prestige
will
be
trampled
in
the
dirt
they
will
say
that
beaten
us
and
will
exult
accordingly
then
to
moral
strength
to
everything
the
first
dike
broken
down
who
will
restrain
this
youth
with
our
fall
we
do
no
more
than
signal
your
own
after
us
the
government
that
not
so
exclaimed
padre
camorra
we
see
first
who
has
the
biggest
fists
at
this
point
padre
fernandez
who
thus
far
in
the
discussion
had
merely
contented
himself
with
smiling
began
to
talk
all
gave
him
their
attention
for
they
knew
him
to
be
a
thoughtful
man
do
take
it
ill
of
me
padre
sibyla
if
i
differ
from
your
view
of
the
affair
but
it
my
peculiar
fate
to
be
almost
always
in
opposition
to
my
brethren
i
say
then
that
we
ought
not
to
be
so
pessimistic
the
instruction
in
castilian
can
be
allowed
without
any
risk
whatever
and
in
order
that
it
may
not
appear
to
be
a
defeat
of
the
university
we
dominicans
ought
to
put
forth
our
efforts
and
be
the
first
to
rejoice
over
it
that
should
be
our
policy
to
what
end
are
we
to
be
engaged
in
an
everlasting
struggle
with
the
people
when
after
all
we
are
the
few
and
they
are
the
many
when
we
need
them
and
they
do
not
need
us
wait
padre
camorra
wait
admit
that
now
the
people
may
be
weak
and
ignorant
i
also
believe
that
but
it
will
not
be
true
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
they
will
be
the
stronger
they
will
know
what
is
good
for
them
and
we
can
not
keep
it
from
them
just
as
it
is
not
possible
to
keep
from
children
the
knowledge
of
many
things
when
they
reach
a
certain
age
i
say
then
why
should
we
not
take
advantage
of
this
condition
of
ignorance
to
change
our
policy
completely
to
place
it
upon
a
basis
solid
and
enduring
on
the
basis
of
justice
for
example
instead
of
on
the
basis
of
ignorance
there
nothing
like
being
just
that
i
always
said
to
my
brethren
but
they
wo
believe
me
the
indian
idolizes
justice
like
every
race
in
its
youth
he
asks
for
punishment
when
he
has
done
wrong
just
as
he
is
exasperated
when
he
has
not
deserved
it
is
theirs
a
just
desire
then
grant
it
let
give
them
all
the
schools
they
want
until
they
are
tired
of
them
youth
is
lazy
and
what
urges
them
to
activity
is
our
opposition
our
bond
of
prestige
padre
sibyla
is
about
worn
out
so
let
prepare
another
the
bond
of
gratitude
for
example
let
not
be
fools
let
do
as
the
crafty
jesuits
padre
fernandez
anything
could
be
tolerated
by
padre
sibyla
except
to
propose
the
jesuits
to
him
as
a
model
pale
and
trembling
he
broke
out
into
bitter
recrimination
a
franciscan
first
anything
before
a
jesuit
he
was
beside
himself
oh
oh
eh
padre
a
general
discussion
broke
out
regardless
of
the
all
talked
at
once
they
yelled
they
misunderstood
and
contradicted
one
another
and
padre
camorra
shook
their
fists
in
each
other
faces
one
talking
of
simpletons
and
the
other
of
padre
sibyla
kept
harping
on
the
and
padre
fernandez
on
the
of
thomas
until
the
curate
of
los
baños
entered
to
announce
that
breakfast
was
served
his
excellency
arose
and
so
ended
the
discussion
well
gentlemen
he
said
we
worked
like
niggers
and
yet
we
on
a
vacation
some
one
has
said
that
grave
matters
should
he
considered
at
dessert
entirely
of
that
opinion
we
might
get
indigestion
remarked
the
secretary
alluding
to
the
heat
of
the
discussion
then
we
lay
it
aside
until
tomorrow
as
they
rose
the
high
official
whispered
to
the
general
your
excellency
the
daughter
of
cabesang
tales
has
been
here
again
begging
for
the
release
of
her
sick
grandfather
who
was
arrested
in
place
of
her
father
his
excellency
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
impatience
and
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
broad
forehead
ca
one
be
left
to
eat
his
breakfast
in
peace
this
is
the
third
day
she
has
come
she
a
poor
girl

devil
exclaimed
padre
camorra
i
just
thought
of
it
i
have
something
to
say
to
the
general
about
that
that
what
i
came
over
for
to
support
that
girl
petition
the
general
scratched
the
back
of
his
ear
and
said
oh

along

the
secretary
make
out
an
order
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
civil
guard
for

old

that
we
not
clement
and

he
looked
at

chapter
xii
placido
penitente
reluctantly
and
almost
with
tearful
eyes
placido
penitente
was
going
along
the
escolta
on
his
way
to
the
university
of
santo
tomas
it
had
hardly
been
a
week
since
he
had
come
from
his
town
yet
he
had
already
written
to
his
mother
twice
reiterating
his
desire
to
abandon
his
studies
and
go
back
there
to
work
his
mother
answered
that
he
should
have
patience
that
at
the
least
he
must
be
graduated
as
a
bachelor
of
arts
since
it
would
be
unwise
to
desert
his
books
after
four
years
of
expense
and
sacrifices
on
both
their
parts
whence
came
to
penitente
this
aversion
to
study
when
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
diligent
in
the
famous
college
conducted
by
padre
valerio
in
tanawan
there
penitente
had
been
considered
one
of
the
best
latinists
and
the
subtlest
disputants
one
who
could
tangle
or
untangle
the
simplest
as
well
as
the
most
abstruse
questions
his
townspeople
considered
him
very
clever
and
his
curate
influenced
by
that
opinion
already
classified
him
as
a
filibuster
a
sure
proof
that
he
was
neither
foolish
nor
incapable
his
friends
could
not
explain
those
desires
for
abandoning
his
studies
and
returning
he
had
no
sweethearts
was
not
a
gambler
hardly
knew
anything
about
and
rarely
tried
his
luck
at
the
more
familiar
he
did
not
believe
in
the
advice
of
the
curates
laughed
at
basio
had
plenty
of
money
and
good
clothes
yet
he
went
to
school
reluctantly
and
looked
with
repugnance
on
his
books
on
the
bridge
of
spain
a
bridge
whose
name
alone
came
from
spain
since
even
its
ironwork
came
from
foreign
countries
he
fell
in
with
the
long
procession
of
young
men
on
their
way
to
the
walled
city
to
their
respective
schools
some
were
dressed
in
the
european
fashion
and
walked
rapidly
carrying
books
and
notes
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
their
lessons
and
essays
these
were
the
students
of
the
ateneo
those
from
san
juan
de
letran
were
nearly
all
dressed
in
the
filipino
costume
but
were
more
numerous
and
carried
fewer
books
those
from
the
university
are
dressed
more
carefully
and
elegantly
and
saunter
along
carrying
canes
instead
of
books
the
collegians
of
the
philippines
are
not
very
noisy
or
turbulent
they
move
along
in
a
preoccupied
manner
such
that
upon
seeing
them
one
would
say
that
before
their
eyes
shone
no
hope
no
smiling
future
even
though
here
and
there
the
line
is
brightened
by
the
attractive
appearance
of
the
schoolgirls
of
the
with
their
sashes
across
their
shoulders
and
their
books
in
their
hands
followed
by
their
servants
yet
scarcely
a
laugh
resounds
or
a
joke
can
be
heard
nothing
of
song
or
jest
at
best
a
few
heavy
jokes
or
scuffles
among
the
smaller
boys
the
older
ones
nearly
always
proceed
seriously
and
composedly
like
the
german
students
placido
was
proceeding
along
the
paseo
de
magallanes
toward
the
breach
formerly
the
gate
of
santo
domingo
when
he
suddenly
felt
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
which
made
him
turn
quickly
in
ill
humor
hello
penitente
hello
penitente
it
was
his
schoolmate
juanito
pelaez
the
or
pet
of
the
professors
as
big
a
rascal
as
he
could
be
with
a
roguish
look
and
a
clownish
smile
the
son
of
a
spanish
mestizo
a
rich
merchant
in
one
of
the
suburbs
who
based
all
his
hopes
and
joys
on
the
talent
he
promised
well
with
his
roguery
and
thanks
to
his
custom
of
playing
tricks
on
every
one
and
then
hiding
behind
his
companions
he
had
acquired
a
peculiar
hump
which
grew
larger
whenever
he
was
laughing
over
his
deviltry
what
kind
of
time
did
you
have
penitente
was
his
question
as
he
again
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
so
so
answered
placido
rather
bored
and
you
well
it
was
great
just
imagine
the
curate
of
tiani
invited
me
to
spend
the
vacation
in
his
town
and
i
went
old
man
you
know
padre
camorra
i
suppose
well
he
a
liberal
curate
very
jolly
frank
very
frank
one
of
those
like
padre
paco
as
there
were
pretty
girls
we
serenaded
them
all
he
with
his
guitar
and
songs
and
i
with
my
violin
i
tell
you
old
man
we
had
a
great
time
there
was
a
house
we
did
try
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
placido
ear
and
then
broke
out
into
laughter
as
the
latter
exhibited
some
surprise
he
resumed
i
swear
to
it
they
ca
help
themselves
because
with
a
governmental
order
you
get
rid
of
the
father
husband
or
brother
and
then
merry
christmas
however
we
did
run
up
against
a
little
fool
the
sweetheart
i
believe
of
basilio
you
know
look
what
a
fool
this
basilio
is
to
have
a
sweetheart
who
does
know
a
word
of
spanish
who
has
any
money
and
who
has
been
a
servant
as
shy
as
she
can
be
but
pretty
padre
camorra
one
night
started
to
club
two
fellows
who
were
serenading
her
and
i
do
know
how
it
was
he
did
kill
them
yet
with
all
that
she
was
just
as
shy
as
ever
but
it
result
for
her
as
it
does
with
all
the
women
all
of
them
juanito
pelaez
laughed
with
a
full
mouth
as
though
he
thought
this
a
glorious
thing
while
placido
stared
at
him
in
disgust
listen
what
did
the
professor
explain
yesterday
asked
juanito
changing
the
conversation
yesterday
there
was
no
class
oho
and
the
day
before
yesterday
man
it
was
thursday
right
what
an
ass
i
am
do
you
know
placido
that
i
getting
to
be
a
regular
ass
what
about

wednesday
it
was
a
little
wet
fine
what
about

the
professor
nameday
and
we
went
to
entertain
him
with
an
orchestra
present
him
flowers
and
some
gifts
ah
exclaimed
juanito
that
i
should
have
forgotten
about
it
what
an
ass
i
am
listen
did
he
ask
for
me
penitente
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
know
but
they
gave
him
a
list
of
his
entertainers
listen
monday
what
happened
as
it
was
the
first
he
called
the
roll
and
assigned
the
lesson
about
mirrors
look
from
here
to
here
by
memory
word
for
word
we
jump
all
this
section
we
take
that
he
was
pointing
out
with
his
finger
in
the
physics
the
portions
that
were
to
be
learned
when
suddenly
the
book
flew
through
the
air
as
a
result
of
the
slap
juanito
gave
it
from
below
thunder
let
the
lessons
go
let
have
a
pichido
the
students
in
manila
call
a
that
falls
between
two
holidays
and
is
consequently
suppressed
as
though
forced
out
by
their
wish
do
you
know
that
you
really
are
an
ass
exclaimed
placido
picking
up
his
book
and
papers
let
have
a
pichido
repeated
juanito
placido
was
unwilling
since
for
only
two
the
authorities
were
hardly
going
to
suspend
a
class
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
he
recalled
the
struggles
and
privations
his
mother
was
suffering
in
order
to
keep
him
in
manila
while
she
went
without
even
the
necessities
of
life
they
were
just
passing
through
the
breach
of
santo
domingo
and
juanito
gazing
across
the
little
plaza
in
front
of
the
old
customs
building
exclaimed
now
i
think
of
it
i
appointed
to
take
up
the
collection
what
collection
for
the
monument
what
monument
get
out
for
padre
balthazar
you
know
and
who
was
padre
balthazar
fool
a
dominican
of
course
that
why
the
padres
call
on
the
students
come
on
now
loosen
up
with
three
or
four
pesos
so
that
they
may
see
we
are
sports
do
let
them
say
afterwards
that
in
order
to
erect
a
statue
they
had
to
dig
down
into
their
own
pockets
do
placido
it
not
money
thrown
away
he
accompanied
these
words
with
a
significant
wink
placido
recalled
the
case
of
a
student
who
had
passed
through
the
entire
course
by
presenting
so
he
subscribed
three
pesos
look
now
i
write
your
name
plainly
so
that
the
professor
will
read
it
you
see
placido
penitente
three
pesos
ah
listen
in
a
couple
of
weeks
comes
the
nameday
of
the
professor
of
natural
history
you
know
that
he
a
good
fellow
never
marks
absences
or
asks
about
the
lesson
man
we
must
show
our
appreciation
that
right
then
do
you
think
that
we
ought
to
give
him
a
celebration
the
orchestra
must
not
be
smaller
than
the
one
you
had
for
the
professor
of
physics
that
right
what
do
you
think
about
making
the
contribution
two
pesos
come
placido
you
start
it
so
you
be
at
the
head
of
the
list
then
seeing
that
placido
gave
the
two
pesos
without
hesitation
he
added
listen
put
up
four
and
afterwards
i
return
you
two
they
serve
as
a
decoy
well
if
you
going
to
return
them
to
me
why
give
them
to
you
it
be
sufficient
for
you
to
write
four
ah
that
right
what
an
ass
i
am
do
you
know
i
getting
to
be
a
regular
ass
but
let
me
have
them
anyhow
so
that
i
can
show
them
placido
in
order
not
to
give
the
lie
to
the
priest
who
christened
him
gave
what
was
asked
just
as
they
reached
the
university
in
the
entrance
and
along
the
walks
on
each
side
of
it
were
gathered
the
students
awaiting
the
appearance
of
the
professors
students
of
the
preparatory
year
of
law
of
the
fifth
of
the
secondary
course
of
the
preparatory
in
medicine
formed
lively
groups
the
latter
were
easily
distinguished
by
their
clothing
and
by
a
certain
air
that
was
lacking
in
the
others
since
the
greater
part
of
them
came
from
the
ateneo
municipal
among
them
could
be
seen
the
poet
isagani
explaining
to
a
companion
the
theory
of
the
refraction
of
light
in
another
group
they
were
talking
disputing
citing
the
statements
of
the
professor
the
and
scholastic
principles
in
yet
another
they
were
gesticulating
and
waving
their
books
in
the
air
or
making
demonstrations
with
their
canes
by
drawing
diagrams
on
the
ground
farther
on
they
were
entertaining
themselves
in
watching
the
pious
women
go
into
the
neighboring
church
all
the
students
making
facetious
remarks
an
old
woman
leaning
on
a
young
girl
limped
piously
while
the
girl
moved
along
writh
downcast
eyes
timid
and
abashed
to
pass
before
so
many
curious
eyes
the
old
lady
catching
up
her
skirt
of
the
sisterhood
of
rita
to
reveal
her
big
feet
and
white
stockings
scolded
her
companion
and
shot
furious
glances
at
the
staring
bystanders
the
rascals
she
grunted
do
look
at
them
keep
your
eyes
down
everything
was
noticed
everything
called
forth
jokes
and
comments
now
it
was
a
magnificent
victoria
which
stopped
at
the
door
to
set
down
a
family
of
votaries
on
their
way
to
visit
the
virgin
of
the
rosary
on
her
favorite
day
while
the
inquisitive
sharpened
their
eyes
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
shape
and
size
of
the
young
ladies
feet
as
they
got
out
of
the
carriages
now
it
was
a
student
who
came
out
of
the
door
with
devotion
still
shining
in
his
eyes
for
he
had
passed
through
the
church
to
beg
the
virgin
help
in
understanding
his
lesson
and
to
see
if
his
sweetheart
was
there
to
exchange
a
few
glances
with
her
and
go
on
to
his
class
with
the
recollection
of
her
loving
eyes
soon
there
was
noticed
some
movement
in
the
groups
a
certain
air
of
expectancy
while
isagani
paused
and
turned
pale
a
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
white
horses
had
stopped
at
the
door
it
was
that
of
paulita
gomez
and
she
had
already
jumped
down
light
as
a
bird
without
giving
the
rascals
time
to
see
her
foot
with
a
bewitching
whirl
of
her
body
and
a
sweep
of
her
hand
she
arranged
the
folds
of
her
skirt
shot
a
rapid
and
apparently
careless
glance
toward
isagani
spoke
to
him
and
smiled
doña
victorina
descended
in
her
turn
gazed
over
her
spectacles
saw
juanito
pelaez
smiled
and
bowed
to
him
affably
isagani
flushed
with
excitement
returned
a
timid
salute
while
juanito
bowed
profoundly
took
off
his
hat
and
made
the
same
gesture
as
the
celebrated
clown
and
caricaturist
panza
when
he
received
applause
heavens
what
a
girl
exclaimed
one
of
the
students
starting
forward
tell
the
professor
that
i
seriously
so
tadeo
as
this
invalid
youth
was
known
entered
the
church
to
follow
the
girl
tadeo
went
to
the
university
every
day
to
ask
if
the
classes
would
be
held
and
each
time
seemed
to
be
more
and
more
astonished
that
they
would
he
had
a
fixed
idea
of
a
latent
and
eternal
and
expected
it
to
come
any
day
so
each
morning
after
vainly
proposing
that
they
play
truant
he
would
go
away
alleging
important
business
an
appointment
or
illness
just
at
the
very
moment
when
his
companions
were
going
to
their
classes
but
by
some
occult
thaumaturgic
art
tadeo
passed
the
examinations
was
beloved
by
the
professors
and
had
before
him
a
promising
future
meanwhile
the
groups
began
to
move
inside
for
the
professor
of
physics
and
chemistry
had
put
in
his
appearance
the
students
appeared
to
be
cheated
in
their
hopes
and
went
toward
the
interior
of
the
building
with
exclamations
of
discontent
placido
went
along
with
the
crowd
penitente
penitente
called
a
student
with
a
certain
mysterious
air
sign
this
what
is
it
never
mind
sign
it
it
seemed
to
placido
that
some
one
was
twitching
his
ears
he
recalled
the
story
of
a
cabeza
de
barangay
in
his
town
who
for
having
signed
a
document
that
he
did
not
understand
was
kept
a
prisoner
for
months
and
months
and
came
near
to
deportation
an
uncle
of
placido
in
order
to
fix
the
lesson
in
his
memory
had
given
him
a
severe
so
that
always
whenever
he
heard
signatures
spoken
of
his
ears
reproduced
the
sensation
excuse
me
but
i
ca
sign
anything
without
first
understanding
what
it
about
what
a
fool
you
are
if
two
have
signed
it
what
have
you
to
fear
the
name
of
inspired
confidence
being
as
it
was
a
sacred
company
created
to
aid
god
in
the
warfare
against
the
evil
spirit
and
to
prevent
the
smuggling
of
heretical
contraband
into
the
markets
of
the
new
zion
placido
was
about
to
sign
to
make
an
end
of
it
because
he
was
in
a
hurry
already
his
classmates
were
reciting
the
but
again
his
ears
twitched
so
he
said
after
the
class
i
want
to
read
it
first
it
very
long
do
you
see
it
concerns
the
presentation
of
a
or
rather
a
protest
do
you
understand
makaraig
and
some
others
have
asked
that
an
academy
of
castilian
be
opened
which
is
a
piece
of
genuine
foolishness
all
right
all
right
after
awhile
they
already
beginning
answered
placido
trying
to
get
away
but
your
professor
may
not
call
the
roll
yes
yes
but
he
calls
it
sometimes
later
on
later
on
besides
i
do
want
to
put
myself
in
opposition
to
makaraig
but
it
not
putting
yourself
in
opposition
it
only
placido
heard
no
more
for
he
was
already
far
away
hurrying
to
his
class
he
heard
the
different
voices
the
roll
was
being
called
hastening
his
steps
he
got
to
the
door
just
as
the
letter
q
was
reached
ñg
he
muttered
biting
his
lips
he
hesitated
about
entering
for
the
mark
was
already
down
against
him
and
was
not
to
be
erased
one
did
not
go
to
the
class
to
learn
but
in
order
not
to
get
this
absence
mark
for
the
class
was
reduced
to
reciting
the
lesson
from
memory
reading
the
book
and
at
the
most
answering
a
few
abstract
profound
captious
enigmatic
questions
true
the
usual
preachment
was
never
lacking
the
same
as
ever
about
humility
submission
and
respect
to
the
clerics
and
he
placido
was
humble
submissive
and
respectful
so
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
he
remembered
that
the
examinations
were
approaching
and
his
professor
had
not
yet
asked
him
a
question
nor
appeared
to
notice
him
this
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
attract
his
attention
and
become
known
to
be
known
was
to
gain
a
year
for
if
it
cost
nothing
to
suspend
one
who
was
not
known
it
required
a
hard
heart
not
to
be
touched
by
the
sight
of
a
youth
who
by
his
daily
presence
was
a
reproach
over
a
year
of
his
life
wasted
so
placido
went
in
not
on
tiptoe
as
was
his
custom
but
noisily
on
his
heels
and
only
too
well
did
he
succeed
in
his
intent
the
professor
stared
at
him
knitted
his
brows
and
shook
his
head
as
though
to
say
ah
little
impudence
you
pay
for
that
chapter
xiii
the
class
in
physics
the
classroom
was
a
spacious
rectangular
hall
with
large
grated
windows
that
admitted
an
abundance
of
light
and
air
along
the
two
sides
extended
three
wide
tiers
of
stone
covered
with
wood
filled
with
students
arranged
in
alphabetical
order
at
the
end
opposite
the
entrance
under
a
print
of
thomas
aquinas
rose
the
chair
on
an
elevated
platform
with
a
little
stairway
on
each
side
with
the
exception
of
a
beautiful
blackboard
in
a
narra
frame
scarcely
ever
used
since
there
was
still
written
on
it
the
that
had
appeared
on
the
opening
day
no
furniture
either
useful
or
useless
was
to
be
seen
the
walls
painted
white
and
covered
with
glazed
tiles
to
prevent
scratches
were
entirely
bare
having
neither
a
drawing
nor
a
picture
nor
even
an
outline
of
any
physical
apparatus
the
students
had
no
need
of
any
no
one
missed
the
practical
instruction
in
an
extremely
experimental
science
for
years
and
years
it
has
been
so
taught
and
the
country
has
not
been
upset
but
continues
just
as
ever
now
and
then
some
little
instrument
descended
from
heaven
and
was
exhibited
to
the
class
from
a
distance
like
the
monstrance
to
the
prostrate
worshipers
look
but
touch
not
from
time
to
time
when
some
complacent
professor
appeared
one
day
in
the
year
was
set
aside
for
visiting
the
mysterious
laboratory
and
gazing
from
without
at
the
puzzling
apparatus
arranged
in
glass
cases
no
one
could
complain
for
on
that
day
there
were
to
be
seen
quantities
of
brass
and
glassware
tubes
disks
wheels
bells
and
the
like
the
exhibition
did
not
get
beyond
that
and
the
country
was
not
upset
besides
the
students
were
convinced
that
those
instruments
had
not
been
purchased
for
them
the
friars
would
be
fools
the
laboratory
was
intended
to
be
shown
to
the
visitors
and
the
high
officials
who
came
from
the
peninsula
so
that
upon
seeing
it
they
would
nod
their
heads
with
satisfaction
while
their
guide
would
smile
as
if
to
say
eh
you
thought
you
were
going
to
find
some
backward
monks
well
we
right
up
with
the
times
we
have
a
laboratory
the
visitors
and
high
officials
after
being
handsomely
entertained
would
then
write
in
their
or
the
royal
and
pontifical
university
of
santo
tomas
of
manila
in
charge
of
the
enlightened
dominican
order
possesses
a
magnificent
physical
laboratory
for
the
instruction
of
youth
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
students
annually
study
this
subject
but
whether
from
apathy
indolence
the
limited
capacity
of
the
indian
or
some
other
ethnological
or
incomprehensible
reason
up
to
now
there
has
not
developed
a
lavoisier
a
secchi
or
a
tyndall
not
even
in
miniature
in
the
race
yet
to
be
exact
we
will
say
that
in
this
laboratory
are
held
the
classes
of
thirty
or
forty
students
under
the
direction
of
an
instructor
who
performs
his
duties
well
enough
but
as
the
greater
part
of
these
students
come
from
the
ateneo
of
the
jesuits
where
science
is
taught
practically
in
the
laboratory
itself
its
utility
does
not
come
to
be
so
great
as
it
would
be
if
it
could
be
utilized
by
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
who
pay
their
matriculation
fees
buy
their
books
memorize
them
and
waste
a
year
to
know
nothing
afterwards
as
a
result
with
the
exception
of
some
rare
usher
or
janitor
who
has
had
charge
of
the
museum
for
years
no
one
has
ever
been
known
to
get
any
advantage
from
the
lessons
memorized
with
so
great
effort
but
let
us
return
to
the
class
the
professor
was
a
young
dominican
who
had
filled
several
chairs
in
san
juan
de
letran
with
zeal
and
good
repute
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
great
logician
as
well
as
a
profound
philosopher
and
was
one
of
the
most
promising
in
his
clique
his
elders
treated
him
with
consideration
while
the
younger
men
envied
him
for
there
were
also
cliques
among
them
this
was
the
third
year
of
his
professorship
and
although
the
first
in
which
he
had
taught
physics
and
chemistry
he
already
passed
for
a
sage
not
only
with
the
complaisant
students
but
also
among
the
other
nomadic
professors
padre
millon
did
not
belong
to
the
common
crowd
who
each
year
change
their
subject
in
order
to
acquire
scientific
knowledge
students
among
other
students
with
the
difference
only
that
they
follow
a
single
course
that
they
quiz
instead
of
being
quizzed
that
they
have
a
better
knowledge
of
castilian
and
that
they
are
not
examined
at
the
completion
of
the
course
padre
millon
went
deeply
into
science
knew
the
physics
of
aristotle
and
padre
amat
read
carefully
his
ramos
and
sometimes
glanced
at
ganot
with
all
that
he
would
often
shake
his
head
with
an
air
of
doubt
as
he
smiled
and
murmured
in
regard
to
chemistry
no
common
knowledge
was
attributed
to
him
after
he
had
taken
as
a
premise
the
statement
of
thomas
that
water
is
a
mixture
and
proved
plainly
that
the
angelic
doctor
had
long
forestalled
berzelius
bunsen
and
other
more
or
less
presumptuous
materialists
moreover
in
spite
of
having
been
an
instructor
in
geography
he
still
entertained
certain
doubts
as
to
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
and
smiled
maliciously
when
its
rotation
and
revolution
around
the
sun
were
mentioned
as
he
recited
the
verses
el
mentir
de
las
estrellas
es
un
cómodo
mentir
he
also
smiled
maliciously
in
the
presence
of
certain
physical
theories
and
considered
visionary
if
not
actually
insane
the
jesuit
secchi
to
whom
he
imputed
the
making
of
triangulations
on
the
host
as
a
result
of
his
astronomical
mania
for
which
reason
it
was
said
that
he
had
been
forbidden
to
celebrate
mass
many
persons
also
noticed
in
him
some
aversion
to
the
sciences
that
he
taught
but
these
vagaries
were
trifles
scholarly
and
religious
prejudices
that
were
easily
explained
not
only
by
the
fact
that
the
physical
sciences
were
eminently
practical
of
pure
observation
and
deduction
while
his
forte
was
philosophy
purely
speculative
of
abstraction
and
induction
but
also
because
like
any
good
dominican
jealous
of
the
fame
of
his
order
he
could
hardly
feel
any
affection
for
a
science
in
which
none
of
his
brethren
had
excelled
he
was
the
first
who
did
not
accept
the
chemistry
of
thomas
aquinas
and
in
which
so
much
renown
had
been
acquired
by
hostile
or
rather
let
us
say
rival
orders
this
was
the
professor
who
that
morning
called
the
roll
and
directed
many
of
the
students
to
recite
the
lesson
from
memory
word
for
word
the
phonographs
got
into
operation
some
well
some
ill
some
stammering
and
received
their
grades
he
who
recited
without
an
error
earned
a
good
mark
and
he
who
made
more
than
three
mistakes
a
bad
mark
a
fat
boy
with
a
sleepy
face
and
hair
as
stiff
and
hard
as
the
bristles
of
a
brush
yawned
until
he
seemed
to
be
about
to
dislocate
his
jaws
and
stretched
himself
with
his
arms
extended
as
though
he
were
in
his
bed
the
professor
saw
this
and
wished
to
startle
him
eh
there
what
this
lazy
too
so
it
sure
you
do
know
the
lesson
ha
padre
millon
not
only
used
the
depreciative
with
the
students
like
a
good
friar
but
he
also
addressed
them
in
the
slang
of
the
markets
a
practise
that
he
had
acquired
from
the
professor
of
canonical
law
whether
that
reverend
gentleman
wished
to
humble
the
students
or
the
sacred
decrees
of
the
councils
is
a
question
not
yet
settled
in
spite
of
the
great
attention
that
has
been
given
to
it
this
question
instead
of
offending
the
class
amused
them
and
many
laughed
it
was
a
daily
occurrence
but
the
sleeper
did
not
laugh
he
arose
with
a
bound
rubbed
his
eyes
and
as
though
a
were
turning
the
phonograph
began
to
recite
the
name
of
mirror
is
applied
to
all
polished
surfaces
intended
to
produce
by
the
reflection
of
light
the
images
of
the
objects
placed
before
said
surfaces
from
the
substances
that
form
these
surfaces
they
are
divided
into
metallic
mirrors
and
glass
mirrors
stop
stop
stop
interrupted
the
professor
heavens
what
a
rattle
we
are
at
the
point
where
the
mirrors
are
divided
into
metallic
and
glass
eh
now
if
i
should
present
to
you
a
block
of
wood
a
piece
of
kamagon
for
instance
well
polished
and
varnished
or
a
slab
of
black
marble
well
burnished
or
a
square
of
jet
which
would
reflect
the
images
of
objects
placed
before
them
how
would
you
classify
those
mirrors
whether
he
did
not
know
what
to
answer
or
did
not
understand
the
question
the
student
tried
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
by
demonstrating
that
he
knew
the
lesson
so
he
rushed
on
like
a
torrent
the
first
are
composed
of
brass
or
an
alloy
of
different
metals
and
the
second
of
a
sheet
of
glass
with
its
two
sides
well
polished
one
of
which
has
an
amalgam
of
tin
adhering
to
it
tut
tut
tut
that
not
it
i
say
to
you
and
you
answer
me
with
in
pace
the
worthy
professor
then
repeated
the
question
in
the
vernacular
of
the
markets
interspersed
with
and
at
every
moment
the
poor
youth
did
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
the
quandary
he
doubted
whether
to
include
the
kamagon
with
the
metals
or
the
marble
with
glasses
and
leave
the
jet
as
a
neutral
substance
until
juanito
pelaez
maliciously
prompted
him
the
mirror
of
kamagon
among
the
wooden
mirrors
the
incautious
youth
repeated
this
aloud
and
half
the
class
was
convulsed
with
laughter
a
good
sample
of
wood
you
are
yourself
exclaimed
the
professor
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
let
see
from
what
you
would
define
a
mirror
from
a
surface
se
in
quantum
est
or
from
a
substance
that
forms
the
surface
or
from
the
substance
upon
which
the
surface
rests
the
raw
material
modified
by
the
attribute
since
it
is
clear
that
surface
being
an
accidental
property
of
bodies
it
can
not
exist
without
substance
let
see
now
what
do
you
say
i
nothing
the
wretched
boy
was
about
to
reply
for
he
did
not
understand
what
it
was
all
about
confused
as
he
was
by
so
many
surfaces
and
so
many
accidents
that
smote
cruelly
on
his
ears
but
a
sense
of
shame
restrained
him
filled
with
anguish
and
breaking
into
a
cold
perspiration
he
began
to
repeat
between
his
teeth
the
name
of
mirror
is
applied
to
all
polished
surfaces
per
the
mirror
is
the
surface
angled
the
professor
well
then
clear
up
this
difficulty
if
the
surface
is
the
mirror
it
must
be
of
no
consequence
to
the
of
the
mirror
what
may
be
found
behind
this
surface
since
what
is
behind
it
does
not
affect
the
that
is
before
it
the
surface
super
faciem
est
quia
vocatur
superficies
facies
ea
quae
supra
do
you
admit
that
or
do
you
not
admit
it
the
poor
youth
hair
stood
up
straighter
than
ever
as
though
acted
upon
by
some
magnetic
force
do
you
admit
it
or
do
you
not
admit
it
anything
whatever
you
wish
padre
was
his
thought
but
he
did
not
dare
to
express
it
from
fear
of
ridicule
that
was
a
dilemma
indeed
and
he
had
never
been
in
a
worse
one
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
most
innocent
thing
could
not
be
admitted
to
the
friars
but
that
they
or
rather
their
estates
and
curacies
would
get
out
of
it
all
the
results
and
advantages
imaginable
so
his
good
angel
prompted
him
to
deny
everything
with
all
the
energy
of
his
soul
and
refractoriness
of
his
hair
and
he
was
about
to
shout
a
proud
for
the
reason
that
he
who
denies
everything
does
not
compromise
himself
in
anything
as
a
certain
lawyer
had
once
told
him
but
the
evil
habit
of
disregarding
the
dictates
of
one
own
conscience
of
having
little
faith
in
legal
folk
and
of
seeking
aid
from
others
where
one
is
sufficient
unto
himself
was
his
undoing
his
companions
especially
juanito
pelaez
were
making
signs
to
him
to
admit
it
so
he
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
his
evil
destiny
and
exclaimed
padre
in
a
voice
as
faltering
as
though
he
were
saying
manus
tuas
commendo
spiritum
echoed
the
professor
smiling
maliciously
i
can
scratch
the
mercury
off
a
put
in
its
place
a
piece
of
and
we
shall
still
have
a
mirror
eh
now
what
shall
we
have
the
youth
gazed
at
his
prompters
but
seeing
them
surprised
and
speechless
contracted
his
features
into
an
expression
of
bitterest
reproach
meus
deus
meus
quare
dereliquiste
me
said
his
troubled
eyes
while
his
lips
muttered
vainly
he
coughed
fumbled
at
his
stood
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
but
found
no
answer
come
now
what
have
we
urged
the
professor
enjoying
the
effect
of
his
reasoning
whispered
juanito
pelaez
shut
up
you
fool
cried
the
desperate
youth
hoping
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
by
turning
it
into
a
complaint
let
see
juanito
if
you
can
answer
the
question
for
me
the
professor
then
said
to
pelaez
who
was
one
of
his
pets
the
latter
rose
slowly
not
without
first
giving
penitente
who
followed
him
on
the
roll
a
nudge
that
meant
do
forget
to
prompt
me
padre
he
replied
resolutely
aha
then
consequentiam
per
the
polished
surface
constitutes
the
of
the
mirror
nego
suppositum
interrupted
juanito
as
he
felt
placido
pulling
at
his
coat
how
you
believe
that
what
is
behind
affects
what
is
in
front
nego
the
student
cried
with
still
more
ardor
feeling
another
jerk
at
his
coat
juanito
or
rather
placido
who
was
prompting
him
was
unconsciously
adopting
chinese
tactics
not
to
admit
the
most
inoffensive
foreigner
in
order
not
to
be
invaded
then
where
are
we
asked
the
professor
somewhat
disconcerted
and
looking
uneasily
at
the
refractory
student
does
the
substance
behind
affect
or
does
it
not
affect
the
surface
to
this
precise
and
categorical
question
a
kind
of
ultimatum
juanito
did
not
know
what
to
reply
and
his
coat
offered
no
suggestions
in
vain
he
made
signs
to
placido
but
placido
himself
was
in
doubt
juanito
then
took
advantage
of
a
moment
in
which
the
professor
was
staring
at
a
student
who
was
cautiously
and
secretly
taking
off
the
shoes
that
hurt
his
feet
to
step
heavily
on
placido
toes
and
whisper
tell
me
hurry
up
tell
me
i
distinguish
get
out
what
an
ass
you
are
yelled
placido
unreservedly
as
he
stared
with
angry
eyes
and
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
shoe
the
professor
heard
the
cry
stared
at
the
pair
and
guessed
what
had
happened
listen
you
meddler
he
addressed
placido
i
was
questioning
you
but
since
you
think
you
can
save
others
let
see
if
you
can
save
yourself
te
ipsum
and
decide
this
question
juanito
sat
down
in
content
and
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
stuck
out
his
tongue
at
his
prompter
who
had
arisen
blushing
with
shame
and
muttering
incoherent
excuses
for
a
moment
padre
millon
regarded
him
as
one
gloating
over
a
favorite
dish
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
to
humiliate
and
hold
up
to
ridicule
that
dudish
boy
always
smartly
dressed
with
head
erect
and
serene
look
it
would
be
a
deed
of
charity
so
the
charitable
professor
applied
himself
to
it
with
all
his
heart
slowly
repeating
the
question
the
book
says
that
the
metallic
mirrors
are
made
of
brass
and
an
alloy
of
different
metals
is
that
true
or
is
it
not
true
so
the
book
says
padre
dixit
ergo
ita
do
pretend
that
you
know
more
than
the
book
does
it
then
adds
that
the
glass
mirrors
are
made
of
a
sheet
of
glass
whose
two
surfaces
are
well
polished
one
of
them
having
applied
to
it
an
amalgam
of
tin
an
amalgam
of
tin
is
that
true
if
the
book
says
so
padre
is
tin
a
metal
it
seems
so
padre
the
book
says
so
it
is
it
is
and
the
word
amalgam
means
that
it
is
compounded
with
mercury
which
is
also
a
metal
a
glass
mirror
is
a
metallic
mirror
the
terms
of
the
distinction
are
confused
the
classification
is
imperfect
how
do
you
explain
that
meddler
he
emphasized
the
and
the
familiar
you
with
indescribable
relish
at
the
same
time
winking
as
though
to
say
you
done
for
it
means
that
it
means
that
stammered
placido
it
means
that
you
have
learned
the
lesson
you
petty
meddler
you
do
understand
it
yourself
and
yet
you
prompt
your
neighbor
the
class
took
no
offense
but
on
the
contrary
many
thought
the
epithet
funny
and
laughed
placido
bit
his
lips
what
your
name
the
professor
asked
him
placido
was
the
curt
reply
aha
placido
penitente
although
you
look
more
like
placido
the
prompter
or
the
prompted
but
i
going
to
impose
some
on
you
for
your
promptings
pleased
with
his
play
on
words
he
ordered
the
youth
to
recite
the
lesson
and
the
latter
in
the
state
of
mind
to
which
he
was
reduced
made
more
than
three
mistakes
shaking
his
head
up
and
down
the
professor
slowly
opened
the
register
and
slowly
scanned
it
while
he
called
off
the
names
in
a
low
voice
palencia

fifteen

placido
started
up
fifteen

fifteen
unexcused
absences
continued
the
professor
so
that
you
only
lack
one
to
be
dropped
from
the
roll
fifteen
absences
fifteen
absences
repeated
placido
in
amazement
i
never
been
absent
more
than
four
times
and
with
today
perhaps
five
jesso
jesso
monseer
replied
the
professor
examining
the
youth
over
his
gold
you
confess
that
you
have
missed
five
times
and
god
knows
if
you
may
have
missed
oftener
as
i
rarely
call
the
roll
every
time
i
catch
any
one
i
put
five
marks
against
him
how
many
are
five
times
five
have
you
forgotten
the
multiplication
table
five
times
five
correct
correct
thus
you
still
got
away
with
ten
because
i
have
caught
you
only
three
times
huh
if
i
had
caught
you
every
time
now
how
many
are
three
times
five
fifteen
fifteen
right
you
are
concluded
the
professor
closing
the
register
if
you
miss
once
more
out
of
doors
with
you
get
out
ah
now
a
mark
for
the
failure
in
the
daily
lesson
he
again
opened
the
register
sought
out
the
name
and
entered
the
mark
come
only
one
mark
he
said
since
you
had
any
before
but
padre
exclaimed
placido
restraining
himself
if
your
reverence
puts
a
mark
against
me
for
failing
in
the
lesson
your
reverence
owes
it
to
me
to
erase
the
one
for
absence
that
you
have
put
against
me
for
today
his
reverence
made
no
answer
first
he
slowly
entered
the
mark
then
contemplated
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
the
mark
must
be
artistic
closed
the
register
and
asked
with
great
sarcasm
and
why
so
sir
because
i
ca
conceive
padre
how
one
can
be
absent
from
the
class
and
at
the
same
time
recite
the
lesson
in
it
your
reverence
is
saying
that
to
be
is
not
to
be
a
metaphysician
but
a
rather
premature
one
so
you
conceive
of
it
eh
patet
and
experientiam
negantem
fusilibus
est
do
you
understand
and
you
conceive
with
your
philosophical
head
that
one
can
be
absent
from
the
class
and
not
know
the
lesson
at
the
same
time
is
it
a
fact
that
absence
necessarily
implies
knowledge
what
do
you
say
to
that
philosophaster
this
last
epithet
was
the
drop
of
water
that
made
the
full
cup
overflow
placido
enjoyed
among
his
friends
the
reputation
of
being
a
philosopher
so
he
lost
his
patience
threw
down
his
book
arose
and
faced
the
professor
enough
padre
enough
your
reverence
can
put
all
the
marks
against
me
that
you
wish
but
you
have
the
right
to
insult
me
your
reverence
may
stay
with
the
class
i
ca
stand
any
more
without
further
farewell
he
stalked
away
the
class
was
astounded
such
an
assumption
of
dignity
had
scarcely
ever
been
seen
and
who
would
have
thought
it
of
placido
penitente
the
surprised
professor
bit
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
threateningly
as
he
watched
him
depart
then
in
a
trembling
voice
he
began
his
preachment
on
the
same
old
theme
delivered
however
with
more
energy
and
more
eloquence
it
dealt
with
the
growing
arrogance
the
innate
ingratitude
the
presumption
the
lack
of
respect
for
superiors
the
pride
that
the
spirit
of
darkness
infused
in
the
young
the
lack
of
manners
the
absence
of
courtesy
and
so
on
from
this
he
passed
to
coarse
jests
and
sarcasm
over
the
presumption
which
some
prompters
had
of
teaching
their
teachers
by
establishing
an
academy
for
instruction
in
castilian
aha
aha
he
moralized
those
who
the
day
before
yesterday
scarcely
knew
how
to
say
padre
padre
now
want
to
know
more
than
those
who
have
grown
gray
teaching
them
he
who
wishes
to
learn
will
learn
academies
or
no
academies
undoubtedly
that
fellow
who
has
just
gone
out
is
one
of
those
in
the
project
castilian
is
in
good
hands
with
such
guardians
when
are
you
going
to
get
the
time
to
attend
the
academy
if
you
have
scarcely
enough
to
fulfill
your
duties
in
the
regular
classes
we
wish
that
you
may
all
know
spanish
and
that
you
pronounce
it
well
so
that
you
wo
split
our
with
your
twist
of
expression
and
your
but
first
business
and
then
pleasure
finish
your
studies
first
and
afterwards
learn
castilian
and
all
become
clerks
if
you
so
wish
so
he
went
on
with
his
harangue
until
the
bell
rang
and
the
class
was
over
the
two
hundred
and
students
after
reciting
their
prayers
went
out
as
ignorant
as
when
they
went
in
but
breathing
more
freely
as
if
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
them
each
youth
had
lost
another
hour
of
his
life
and
with
it
a
portion
of
his
dignity
and
and
in
exchange
there
was
an
increase
of
discontent
of
aversion
to
study
of
resentment
in
their
hearts
after
all
this
ask
for
knowledge
dignity
gratitude
nobis
post
haec
tristis
sententia
just
as
the
two
hundred
and
spent
their
class
hours
so
the
thousands
of
students
who
preceded
them
have
spent
theirs
and
if
matters
do
not
mend
so
will
those
yet
to
come
spend
theirs
and
be
brutalized
while
wounded
dignity
and
youthful
enthusiasm
will
be
converted
into
hatred
and
sloth
like
the
waves
that
become
polluted
along
one
part
of
the
shore
and
roll
on
one
after
another
each
in
succession
depositing
a
larger
sediment
of
filth
but
yet
he
who
from
eternity
watches
the
consequences
of
a
deed
develop
like
a
thread
through
the
loom
of
the
centuries
he
who
weighs
the
value
of
a
second
and
has
ordained
for
his
creatures
as
an
elemental
law
progress
and
development
he
if
he
is
just
will
demand
a
strict
accounting
from
those
who
must
render
it
of
the
millions
of
intelligences
darkened
and
blinded
of
human
dignity
trampled
upon
in
millions
of
his
creatures
and
of
the
incalculable
time
lost
and
effort
wasted
and
if
the
teachings
of
the
gospel
are
based
on
truth
so
also
will
these
have
to
answer
the
millions
and
millions
who
do
not
know
how
to
preserve
the
light
of
their
intelligences
and
their
dignity
of
mind
as
the
master
demanded
an
accounting
from
the
cowardly
servant
for
the
talent
that
he
let
be
taken
from
him
chapter

in
the
house
of
the
students
the
house
where
makaraig
lived
was
worth
visiting
large
and
spacious
with
two
entresols
provided
with
elegant
gratings
it
seemed
to
be
a
school
during
the
first
hours
of
the
morning
and
pandemonium
from
ten
on
during
the
boarders
recreation
hours
from
the
lower
hallway
of
the
spacious
entrance
up
to
the
main
floor
there
was
a
bubbling
of
laughter
shouts
and
movement
boys
in
scanty
clothing
played
or
practised
gymnastic
exercises
on
improvised
trapezes
while
on
the
staircase
a
fight
was
in
progress
between
eight
or
nine
armed
with
canes
sticks
and
ropes
but
neither
attackers
nor
attacked
did
any
great
damage
their
blows
generally
falling
sidewise
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
chinese
pedler
who
was
there
selling
his
outlandish
mixtures
and
indigestible
pastries
crowds
of
boys
surrounded
him
pulled
at
his
already
disordered
queue
snatched
pies
from
him
haggled
over
the
prices
and
committed
a
thousand
deviltries
the
chinese
yelled
swore
forswore
in
all
the
languages
he
could
jabber
not
omitting
his
own
he
whimpered
laughed
pleaded
put
on
a
smiling
face
when
an
ugly
one
would
not
serve
or
the
reverse
he
cursed
them
as
devils
savages
but
that
mattered
nothing
a
whack
would
bring
his
face
around
smiling
and
if
the
blow
fell
only
upon
his
shoulders
he
would
calmly
continue
his
business
transactions
contenting
himself
with
crying
out
to
them
that
he
was
not
in
the
game
but
if
it
struck
the
flat
basket
on
which
were
placed
his
wares
then
he
would
swear
never
to
come
again
as
he
poured
out
upon
them
all
the
imprecations
and
anathemas
imaginable
then
the
boys
would
redouble
their
efforts
to
make
him
rage
the
more
and
when
at
last
his
vocabulary
was
exhausted
and
they
were
satiated
with
his
fearful
mixtures
they
paid
him
religiously
and
sent
him
away
happy
winking
chuckling
to
himself
and
receiving
as
caresses
the
light
blows
from
their
canes
that
the
students
gave
him
as
tokens
of
farewell
concerts
on
the
piano
and
violin
the
guitar
and
the
accordion
alternated
with
the
continual
clashing
of
blades
from
the
fencing
lessons
around
a
long
wide
table
the
students
of
the
ateneo
prepared
their
compositions
or
solved
their
problems
by
the
side
of
others
writing
to
their
sweethearts
on
pink
perforated
covered
with
drawings
here
one
was
composing
a
melodrama
at
the
side
of
another
practising
on
the
flute
from
which
he
drew
wheezy
notes
over
there
the
older
boys
students
in
professional
courses
who
affected
silk
socks
and
embroidered
slippers
amused
themselves
in
teasing
the
smaller
boys
by
pulling
their
ears
already
red
from
repeated
fillips
while
two
or
three
held
down
a
little
fellow
who
yelled
and
cried
defending
himself
with
his
feet
against
being
reduced
to
the
condition
in
which
he
was
born
kicking
and
howling
in
one
room
around
a
small
table
four
were
playing
with
laughter
and
jokes
to
the
great
annoyance
of
another
who
pretended
to
be
studying
his
lesson
but
who
was
in
reality
waiting
his
turn
to
play
still
another
came
in
with
exaggerated
wonder
scandalized
as
he
approached
the
table
how
wicked
you
are
so
early
in
the
morning
and
already
gambling
let
see
let
see
you
fool
take
it
with
the
three
of
spades
closing
his
book
he
too
joined
in
the
game
cries
and
blows
were
heard
two
boys
were
fighting
in
the
adjoining
room
a
lame
student
who
was
very
sensitive
about
his
infirmity
and
an
unhappy
newcomer
from
the
provinces
who
was
just
commencing
his
studies
he
was
working
over
a
treatise
on
philosophy
and
reading
innocently
in
a
loud
voice
with
a
wrong
accent
the
cartesian
principle
ergo
sum
the
little
lame
boy
took
this
as
an
insult
and
the
others
intervened
to
restore
peace
but
in
reality
only
to
sow
discord
and
come
to
blows
themselves
in
the
a
young
man
with
a
can
of
sardines
a
bottle
of
wine
and
the
provisions
that
he
had
just
brought
from
his
town
was
making
heroic
efforts
to
the
end
that
his
friends
might
participate
in
his
lunch
while
they
were
offering
in
their
turn
heroic
resistance
to
his
invitation
others
were
bathing
on
the
azotea
playing
firemen
with
the
water
from
the
well
and
joining
in
combats
with
pails
of
water
to
the
great
delight
of
the
spectators
but
the
noise
and
shouts
gradually
died
away
with
the
coming
of
leading
students
summoned
by
makaraig
to
report
to
them
the
progress
of
the
academy
of
castilian
isagani
was
cordially
greeted
as
was
also
the
peninsular
sandoval
who
had
come
to
manila
as
a
government
employee
and
was
finishing
his
studies
and
who
had
completely
identified
himself
with
the
cause
of
the
filipino
students
the
barriers
that
politics
had
established
between
the
races
had
disappeared
in
the
schoolroom
as
though
dissolved
by
the
zeal
of
science
and
youth
from
lack
of
lyceums
and
scientific
literary
or
political
centers
sandoval
took
advantage
of
all
the
meetings
to
cultivate
his
great
oratorical
gifts
delivering
speeches
and
arguing
on
any
subject
to
draw
forth
applause
from
his
friends
and
listeners
at
that
moment
the
subject
of
conversation
was
the
instruction
in
castilian
but
as
makaraig
had
not
yet
arrived
conjecture
was
still
the
order
of
the
day
what
can
have
happened
what
has
the
general
decided
has
he
refused
the
permit
has
padre
irene
or
padre
sibyla
won
such
were
the
questions
they
asked
one
another
questions
that
could
be
answered
only
by
makaraig
among
the
young
men
gathered
together
there
were
optimists
like
isagani
and
sandoval
who
saw
the
thing
already
accomplished
and
talked
of
congratulations
and
praise
from
the
government
for
the
patriotism
of
the
students
outbursts
of
optimism
that
led
juanito
pelaez
to
claim
for
himself
a
large
part
of
the
glory
of
founding
the
society
all
this
was
answered
by
the
pessimist
pecson
a
chubby
youth
with
a
wide
clownish
grin
who
spoke
of
outside
influences
whether
the
bishop
the
padre
or
the
provincial
had
been
consulted
or
not
whether
or
not
they
had
advised
that
the
whole
association
should
be
put
in
jail
a
suggestion
that
made
juanito
pelaez
so
uneasy
that
he
stammered
out
do
you
drag
me
into
sandoval
as
a
peninsular
and
a
liberal
became
furious
at
this
but
pshaw
he
exclaimed
that
is
holding
a
bad
opinion
of
his
excellency
i
know
that
he
quite
a
but
in
such
a
matter
as
this
he
wo
let
the
friars
interfere
will
you
tell
me
pecson
on
what
you
base
your
belief
that
the
general
has
no
judgment
of
his
own
i
did
say
that
sandoval
replied
pecson
grinning
until
he
exposed
his
for
me
the
general
has
judgment
that
is
the
judgment
of
all
those
within
his
reach
that
plain
you
dodging
cite
me
a
fact
cite
me
a
fact
cried
sandoval
let
get
away
from
hollow
arguments
from
empty
phrases
and
get
on
the
solid
ground
of
facts
this
with
an
elegant
gesture
facts
gentlemen
facts
the
rest
is
prejudice
i
call
it
filibusterism
pecson
smiled
like
one
of
the
blessed
as
he
retorted
there
comes
the
filibusterism
but
ca
we
enter
into
a
discussion
without
resorting
to
accusations
sandoval
protested
in
a
little
extemporaneous
speech
again
demanding
facts
well
not
long
ago
there
was
a
dispute
between
some
private
persons
and
certain
friars
and
the
acting
governor
rendered
a
decision
that
it
should
be
settled
by
the
provincial
of
the
order
concerned
replied
pecson
again
breaking
out
into
a
laugh
as
though
he
were
dealing
with
an
insignificant
matter
he
cited
names
and
dates
and
promised
documents
that
would
prove
how
justice
was
dispensed
but
on
what
ground
tell
me
this
on
what
ground
can
they
refuse
permission
for
what
plainly
appears
to
be
extremely
useful
and
necessary
asked
sandoval
pecson
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
that
it
endangers
the
integrity
of
the
fatherland
he
replied
in
the
tone
of
a
notary
reading
an
allegation
that
pretty
good
what
has
the
integrity
of
the
fatherland
to
do
with
the
rules
of
syntax
the
holy
mother
church
has
learned
doctors
what
do
i
know
perhaps
it
is
feared
that
we
may
come
to
understand
the
laws
so
that
we
can
obey
them
what
will
become
of
the
philippines
on
the
day
when
we
understand
one
another
sandoval
did
not
relish
the
dialectic
and
jesting
turn
of
the
conversation
along
that
path
could
rise
no
speech
worth
the
while
do
make
a
joke
of
things
he
exclaimed
this
is
a
serious
matter
the
lord
deliver
me
from
joking
when
there
are
friars
concerned
but
on
what
do
you
base
on
the
fact
that
the
hours
for
the
classes
having
to
come
at
night
continued
pecson
in
the
same
tone
as
if
he
were
quoting
known
and
recognized
formulas
there
may
be
invoked
as
an
obstacle
the
immorality
of
the
thing
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
the
school
at
malolos
another
but
do
the
classes
of
the
academy
of
drawing
and
the
novenaries
and
the
processions
cover
themselves
with
the
mantle
of
night
the
scheme
affects
the
dignity
of
the
university
went
on
the
chubby
youth
taking
no
notice
of
the
question
affects
nothing
the
university
has
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
needs
of
the
students
and
granting
that
what
is
a
university
then
is
it
an
institution
to
discourage
study
have
a
few
men
banded
themselves
together
in
the
name
of
learning
and
instruction
in
order
to
prevent
others
from
becoming
enlightened
the
fact
is
that
movements
initiated
from
below
are
regarded
as
discontent
what
about
projects
that
come
from
above
interpolated
one
of
the
students
there
the
school
of
arts
and
trades
slowly
slowly
gentlemen
protested
sandoval
i
not
a
my
liberal
views
being
well
known
but
render
unto
caesar
that
which
is
caesar
of
that
school
of
arts
and
trades
of
which
i
have
been
the
most
enthusiastic
supporter
and
the
realization
of
which
i
shall
greet
as
the
first
streak
of
dawn
for
these
fortunate
islands
of
that
school
of
arts
and
trades
the
friars
have
taken
charge
or
the
cat
of
the
canary
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
added
pecson
in
his
turn
interrupting
the
speech
get
out
cried
sandoval
enraged
at
the
interruption
which
had
caused
him
to
lose
the
thread
of
his
long
sentence
as
long
as
we
hear
nothing
bad
let
not
be
pessimists
let
not
be
unjust
doubting
the
liberty
and
independence
of
the
government
here
he
entered
upon
a
defense
in
beautiful
phraseology
of
the
government
and
its
good
intentions
a
subject
that
pecson
dared
not
break
in
upon
the
spanish
government
he
said
among
other
things
has
given
you
everything
it
has
denied
you
nothing
we
had
absolutism
in
spain
and
you
had
absolutism
here
the
friars
covered
our
soil
with
conventos
and
conventos
occupy
a
third
part
of
manila
in
spain
the
garrote
prevails
and
here
the
garrote
is
the
extreme
punishment
we
are
catholics
and
we
have
made
you
catholics
we
were
scholastics
and
scholasticism
sheds
its
light
in
your
college
halls
in
short
gentlemen
we
weep
when
you
weep
we
suffer
when
you
suffer
we
have
the
same
altars
the
same
courts
the
same
punishments
and
it
is
only
just
that
we
should
give
you
our
rights
and
our
joys
as
no
one
interrupted
him
he
became
more
and
more
enthusiastic
until
he
came
to
speak
of
the
future
of
the
philippines
as
i
have
said
gentlemen
the
dawn
is
not
far
distant
spain
is
now
breaking
the
eastern
sky
for
her
beloved
philippines
and
the
times
are
changing
as
i
positively
know
faster
than
we
imagine
this
government
which
according
to
you
is
vacillating
and
weak
should
be
strengthened
by
our
confidence
that
we
may
make
it
see
that
it
is
the
custodian
of
our
hopes
let
us
remind
it
by
our
conduct
should
it
ever
forget
itself
which
i
do
not
believe
can
happen
that
we
have
faith
in
its
good
intentions
and
that
it
should
be
guided
by
no
other
standard
than
justice
and
the
welfare
of
all
the
governed
no
gentlemen
he
went
on
in
a
tone
more
and
more
declamatory
we
must
not
admit
at
all
in
this
matter
the
possibility
of
a
consultation
with
other
more
or
less
hostile
entities
as
such
a
supposition
would
imply
our
resignation
to
the
fact
your
conduct
up
to
the
present
has
been
frank
loyal
without
vacillation
above
suspicion
you
have
addressed
it
simply
and
directly
the
reasons
you
have
presented
could
not
be
more
sound
your
aim
is
to
lighten
the
labor
of
the
teachers
in
the
first
years
and
to
facilitate
study
among
the
hundreds
of
students
who
fill
the
college
halls
and
for
whom
one
solitary
professor
can
not
suffice
if
up
to
the
present
the
petition
has
not
been
granted
it
has
been
for
the
reason
as
i
feel
sure
that
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
material
accumulated
but
i
predict
that
the
campaign
is
won
that
the
summons
of
makaraig
is
to
announce
to
us
the
victory
and
tomorrow
we
shall
see
our
efforts
crowned
with
the
applause
and
appreciation
of
the
country
and
who
knows
gentlemen
but
that
the
government
may
confer
upon
you
some
handsome
decoration
of
merit
benefactors
as
you
are
of
the
fatherland
enthusiastic
applause
resounded
all
immediately
believed
in
the
triumph
and
many
in
the
decoration
let
it
be
remembered
gentlemen
observed
juanito
that
i
was
one
of
the
first
to
propose
it
the
pessimist
pecson
was
not
so
enthusiastic
just
so
we
do
get
that
decoration
on
our
ankles
he
remarked
but
fortunately
for
pelaez
this
comment
was
not
heard
in
the
midst
of
the
applause
when
they
had
quieted
down
a
little
pecson
replied
good
good
very
good
but
one
supposition
if
in
spite
of
all
that
the
general
consults
and
consults
and
consults
and
afterwards
refuses
the
permit
this
question
fell
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
all
turned
to
sandoval
who
was
taken
aback
then
he
stammered
then
then
he
exclaimed
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
still
excited
by
the
applause
seeing
that
in
writing
and
in
printing
it
boasts
of
desiring
your
enlightenment
and
yet
hinders
and
denies
it
when
called
upon
to
make
it
a
reality
then
gentlemen
your
efforts
will
not
have
been
in
vain
you
will
have
accomplished
what
no
one
else
has
been
able
to
do
make
them
drop
the
mask
and
fling
down
the
gauntlet
to
you
bravo
bravo
cried
several
enthusiastically
good
for
sandoval
hurrah
for
the
gauntlet
added
others
let
them
fling
down
the
gauntlet
to
us
repeated
pecson
disdainfully
but
afterwards
sandoval
seemed
to
be
cut
short
in
his
triumph
but
with
the
vivacity
peculiar
to
his
race
and
his
oratorical
temperament
he
had
an
immediate
reply
afterwards
he
asked
afterwards
if
none
of
the
filipinos
dare
to
accept
the
challenge
then
i
sandoval
in
the
name
of
spain
will
take
up
the
gauntlet
because
such
a
policy
would
give
the
lie
to
the
good
intentions
that
she
has
always
cherished
toward
her
provinces
and
because
he
who
is
thus
faithless
to
the
trust
reposed
in
him
and
abuses
his
unlimited
authority
deserves
neither
the
protection
of
the
fatherland
nor
the
support
of
any
spanish
citizen
the
enthusiasm
of
his
hearers
broke
all
bounds
isagani
embraced
him
the
others
following
his
example
they
talked
of
the
fatherland
of
union
of
fraternity
of
fidelity
the
filipinos
declared
that
if
there
were
only
sandovals
in
spain
all
would
be
sandovals
in
the
philippines
his
eyes
glistened
and
it
might
well
be
believed
that
if
at
that
moment
any
kind
of
gauntlet
had
been
flung
at
him
he
would
have
leaped
upon
any
kind
of
horse
to
ride
to
death
for
the
philippines
the
cold
water
alone
replied
good
that
very
good
sandoval
i
could
also
say
the
same
if
i
were
a
peninsular
but
not
being
one
if
i
should
say
one
half
of
what
you
have
you
yourself
would
take
me
for
a
filibuster
sandoval
began
a
speech
in
protest
but
was
interrupted
rejoice
friends
rejoice
victory
cried
a
youth
who
entered
at
that
moment
and
began
to
embrace
everybody
rejoice
friends
long
live
the
castilian
tongue
an
outburst
of
applause
greeted
this
announcement
they
fell
to
embracing
one
another
and
their
eyes
filled
with
tears
pecson
alone
preserved
his
skeptical
smile
the
bearer
of
such
good
news
was
makaraig
the
young
man
at
the
head
of
the
movement
this
student
occupied
in
that
house
by
himself
two
rooms
luxuriously
furnished
and
had
his
servant
and
a
cochero
to
look
after
his
carriage
and
horses
he
was
of
robust
carriage
of
refined
manners
fastidiously
dressed
and
very
rich
although
studying
law
only
that
he
might
have
an
academic
degree
he
enjoyed
a
reputation
for
diligence
and
as
a
logician
in
the
scholastic
way
had
no
cause
to
envy
the
most
frenzied
quibblers
of
the
university
faculty
nevertheless
he
was
not
very
far
behind
in
regard
to
modern
ideas
and
progress
for
his
fortune
enabled
him
to
have
all
the
books
and
magazines
that
a
watchful
censor
was
unable
to
keep
out
with
these
qualifications
and
his
reputation
for
courage
his
fortunate
associations
in
his
earlier
years
and
his
refined
and
delicate
courtesy
it
was
not
strange
that
he
should
exercise
such
great
influence
over
his
associates
and
that
he
should
have
been
chosen
to
carry
out
such
a
difficult
undertaking
as
that
of
the
instruction
in
castilian
after
the
first
outburst
of
enthusiasm
which
in
youth
always
takes
hold
in
such
exaggerated
forms
since
youth
finds
everything
beautiful
they
wanted
to
be
informed
how
the
affair
had
been
managed
i
saw
padre
irene
this
morning
said
makaraig
with
a
certain
air
of
mystery
hurrah
for
padre
irene
cried
an
enthusiastic
student
padre
irene
continued
makaraig
has
told
me
about
everything
that
took
place
at
los
baños
it
seems
that
they
disputed
for
at
least
a
week
he
supporting
and
defending
our
case
against
all
of
them
against
padre
sibyla
padre
fernandez
padre
salvi
the
general
the
jeweler
simoun
the
jeweler
simoun
interrupted
one
of
his
listeners
what
has
that
jew
to
do
with
the
affairs
of
our
country
we
enrich
him
by
buying
keep
quiet
admonished
another
impatiently
anxious
to
learn
how
padre
irene
had
been
able
to
overcome
such
formidable
opponents
there
were
even
high
officials
who
were
opposed
to
our
project
the
head
secretary
the
civil
governor
quiroga
the
chinaman
quiroga
the
chinaman
the
pimp
of
the
shut
up
at
last
resumed
makaraig
they
were
going
to
pigeonhole
the
petition
and
let
it
sleep
for
months
and
months
when
padre
irene
remembered
the
superior
commission
of
primary
instruction
and
proposed
since
the
matter
concerned
the
teaching
of
the
castilian
tongue
that
the
petition
be
referred
to
that
body
for
a
report
upon
it
but
that
commission
has
been
in
operation
for
a
long
time
observed
pecson
that
exactly
what
they
replied
to
padre
irene
and
he
answered
that
this
was
a
good
opportunity
to
revive
it
and
availing
himself
of
the
presence
of
don
custodio
one
of
its
members
he
proposed
on
the
spot
that
a
committee
should
be
appointed
don
custodio
activity
being
known
and
recognized
he
was
named
as
arbiter
and
the
petition
is
now
in
his
hands
he
promised
that
he
would
settle
it
this
month
hurrah
for
don
custodio
but
suppose
don
custodio
should
report
unfavorably
upon
it
inquired
the
pessimist
pecson
upon
this
they
had
not
reckoned
being
intoxicated
with
the
thought
that
the
matter
would
not
be
pigeonholed
so
they
all
turned
to
makaraig
to
learn
how
it
could
be
arranged
the
same
objection
i
presented
to
padre
irene
but
with
his
sly
smile
he
said
to
me
won
a
great
deal
we
have
succeeded
in
getting
the
matter
on
the
road
to
a
decision
the
opposition
sees
itself
forced
to
join
battle
if
we
can
bring
some
influence
to
bear
upon
don
custodio
so
that
he
in
accordance
with
his
liberal
tendencies
may
report
favorably
all
is
won
for
the
general
showed
himself
to
be
absolutely
neutral
makaraig
paused
and
an
impatient
listener
asked
how
can
we
influence
him
padre
irene
pointed
out
to
me
two
ways
quiroga
some
one
suggested
pshaw
great
use
quiroga
a
fine
present
no
that
wo
do
for
he
prides
himself
upon
being
incorruptible
ah
yes
i
know
exclaimed
pecson
with
a
laugh
pepay
the
dancing
girl
ah
yes
pepay
the
dancing
girl
echoed
several
this
pepay
was
a
showy
girl
supposed
to
be
a
great
friend
of
don
custodio
to
her
resorted
the
contractors
the
employees
the
intriguers
when
they
wanted
to
get
something
from
the
celebrated
councilor
juanito
pelaez
who
was
also
a
great
friend
of
the
dancing
girl
offered
to
look
after
the
matter
but
isagani
shook
his
head
saying
that
it
was
sufficient
that
they
had
made
use
of
padre
irene
and
that
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
avail
themselves
of
pepay
in
such
an
affair
show
us
the
other
way
the
other
way
is
to
apply
to
his
attorney
and
adviser
señor
pasta
the
oracle
before
whom
don
custodio
bows
i
prefer
that
said
isagani
señor
pasta
is
a
filipino
and
was
a
schoolmate
of
my
uncle
but
how
can
we
interest
him
there
the
replied
makaraig
looking
earnestly
at
isagani
señor
pasta
has
a
dancing
girl
i
mean
a
seamstress
isagani
again
shook
his
head
do
be
such
a
puritan
juanito
pelaez
said
to
him
the
end
justifies
the
means
i
know
the
seamstress
matea
for
she
has
a
shop
where
a
lot
of
girls
work
no
gentlemen
declared
isagani
let
first
employ
decent
methods
i
go
to
señor
pasta
and
if
i
do
accomplish
anything
then
you
can
do
what
you
wish
with
the
dancing
girls
and
seamstresses
they
had
to
accept
this
proposition
agreeing
that
isagani
should
talk
to
señor
pasta
that
very
day
and
in
the
afternoon
report
to
his
associates
at
the
university
the
result
of
the
interview
chapter
xv
señor
pasta
isagani
presented
himself
in
the
house
of
the
lawyer
one
of
the
most
talented
minds
in
manila
whom
the
friars
consulted
in
their
great
difficulties
the
youth
had
to
wait
some
time
on
account
of
the
numerous
clients
but
at
last
his
turn
came
and
he
entered
the
office
or
as
it
is
generally
called
in
the
philippines
the
lawyer
received
him
with
a
slight
cough
looking
down
furtively
at
his
feet
but
he
did
not
rise
or
offer
a
seat
as
he
went
on
writing
this
gave
isagani
an
opportunity
for
observation
and
careful
study
of
the
lawyer
who
had
aged
greatly
his
hair
was
gray
and
his
baldness
extended
over
nearly
the
whole
crown
of
his
head
his
countenance
was
sour
and
austere
there
was
complete
silence
in
the
study
except
for
the
whispers
of
the
clerks
and
understudies
who
were
at
work
in
an
adjoining
room
their
pens
scratched
as
though
quarreling
with
the
paper
at
length
the
lawyer
finished
what
he
was
writing
laid
down
his
pen
raised
his
head
and
recognizing
the
youth
let
his
face
light
up
with
a
smile
as
he
extended
his
hand
affectionately
welcome
young
man
but
sit
down
and
excuse
me
for
i
did
know
that
it
was
you
how
is
your
uncle
isagani
took
courage
believing
that
his
case
would
get
on
well
he
related
briefly
what
had
been
done
the
while
studying
the
effect
of
his
words
señor
pasta
listened
impassively
at
first
and
although
he
was
informed
of
the
efforts
of
the
students
pretended
ignorance
as
if
to
show
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
such
childish
matters
but
when
he
began
to
suspect
what
was
wanted
of
him
and
heard
mention
of
the
friars
the
a
project
and
so
on
his
face
slowly
darkened
and
he
finally
exclaimed
this
is
the
land
of
projects
but
go
on
go
on
isagani
was
not
yet
discouraged
he
spoke
of
the
manner
in
which
a
decision
was
to
be
reached
and
concluded
with
an
expression
of
the
confidence
which
the
young
men
entertained
that
he
señor
pasta
would
in
their
behalf
in
case
don
custodio
should
consult
him
as
was
to
be
expected
he
did
not
dare
to
say
would
deterred
by
the
wry
face
the
lawyer
put
on
but
señor
pasta
had
already
formed
his
resolution
and
it
was
not
to
mix
at
all
in
the
affair
either
as
consulter
or
consulted
he
was
familiar
with
what
had
occurred
at
los
baños
he
knew
that
there
existed
two
factions
and
that
padre
irene
was
not
the
only
champion
on
the
side
of
the
students
nor
had
he
been
the
one
who
proposed
submitting
the
petition
to
the
commission
of
primary
instruction
but
quite
the
contrary
padre
irene
padre
fernandez
the
countess
a
merchant
who
expected
to
sell
the
materials
for
the
new
academy
and
the
high
official
who
had
been
citing
royal
decree
after
royal
decree
were
about
to
triumph
when
padre
sibyla
wishing
to
gain
time
had
thought
of
the
commission
all
these
facts
the
great
lawyer
had
present
in
his
mind
so
that
when
isagani
had
finished
speaking
he
determined
to
confuse
him
with
evasions
tangle
the
matter
up
and
lead
the
conversation
to
other
subjects
yes
he
said
pursing
his
lips
and
scratching
his
head
there
is
no
one
who
surpasses
me
in
love
for
the
country
and
in
aspirations
toward
progress
but
i
ca
compromise
myself
i
do
know
whether
you
clearly
understand
my
position
a
position
that
is
very
delicate
i
have
so
many
interests
i
have
to
labor
within
the
limits
of
strict
prudence
it
a
risk
the
lawyer
sought
to
bewilder
the
youth
with
an
exuberance
of
words
so
he
went
on
speaking
of
laws
and
decrees
and
talked
so
much
that
instead
of
confusing
the
youth
he
came
very
near
to
entangling
himself
in
a
labyrinth
of
citations
in
no
way
do
we
wish
to
compromise
you
replied
isagani
with
great
calmness
god
deliver
us
from
injuring
in
the
least
the
persons
whose
lives
are
so
useful
to
the
rest
of
the
filipinos
but
as
little
versed
as
i
may
be
in
the
laws
royal
decrees
writs
and
resolutions
that
obtain
in
this
country
i
ca
believe
that
there
can
be
any
harm
in
furthering
the
high
purposes
of
the
government
in
trying
to
secure
a
proper
interpretation
of
these
purposes
we
are
seeking
the
same
end
and
differ
only
about
the
means
the
lawyer
smiled
for
the
youth
had
allowed
himself
to
wander
away
from
the
subject
and
there
where
the
former
was
going
to
entangle
him
he
had
already
entangled
himself
that
exactly
the
as
is
vulgarly
said
it
clear
that
it
is
laudable
to
aid
the
government
when
one
aids
it
submissively
following
out
its
desires
and
the
true
spirit
of
the
laws
in
agreement
with
the
just
beliefs
of
the
governing
powers
and
when
not
in
contradiction
to
the
fundamental
and
general
way
of
thinking
of
the
persons
to
whom
is
intrusted
the
common
welfare
of
the
individuals
that
form
a
social
organism
therefore
it
is
criminal
it
is
punishable
because
it
is
offensive
to
the
high
principle
of
authority
to
attempt
any
action
contrary
to
its
initiative
even
supposing
it
to
be
better
than
the
governmental
proposition
because
such
action
would
injure
its
prestige
which
is
the
elementary
basis
upon
which
all
colonial
edifices
rest
confident
that
this
broadside
had
at
least
stunned
isagani
the
old
lawyer
fell
back
in
his
armchair
outwardly
very
serious
but
laughing
to
himself
isagani
however
ventured
to
reply
i
should
think
that
governments
the
more
they
are
threatened
would
be
all
the
more
careful
to
seek
bases
that
are
impregnable
the
basis
of
prestige
for
colonial
governments
is
the
weakest
of
all
since
it
does
not
depend
upon
themselves
but
upon
the
consent
of
the
governed
while
the
latter
are
willing
to
recognize
it
the
basis
of
justice
or
reason
would
seem
to
be
the
most
durable
the
lawyer
raised
his
head
how
was
this
did
that
youth
dare
to
reply
and
argue
with
him
señor
pasta
was
he
not
yet
bewildered
with
his
big
words
young
man
you
must
put
those
considerations
aside
for
they
are
dangerous
he
declared
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
what
i
advise
is
that
you
let
the
government
attend
to
its
own
business
governments
are
established
for
the
welfare
of
the
peoples
and
in
order
to
accomplish
this
purpose
properly
they
have
to
follow
the
suggestions
of
the
citizens
who
are
the
ones
best
qualified
to
understand
their
own
needs
those
who
constitute
the
government
are
also
citizens
and
among
the
most
enlightened
but
being
men
they
are
fallible
and
ought
not
to
disregard
the
opinions
of
others
they
must
be
trusted
they
have
to
attend
to
everything
there
is
a
spanish
proverb
which
says
tears
no
milk
in
other
words
him
who
does
not
ask
nothing
is
given
quite
the
reverse
replied
the
lawyer
with
a
sarcastic
smile
with
the
government
exactly
the
reverse
occurs
but
he
suddenly
checked
himself
as
if
he
had
said
too
much
and
wished
to
correct
his
imprudence
the
government
has
given
us
things
that
we
have
not
asked
for
and
that
we
could
not
ask
for
because
to
ask
to
ask
presupposes
that
it
is
in
some
way
incompetent
and
consequently
is
not
performing
its
functions
to
suggest
to
it
a
course
of
action
to
try
to
guide
it
when
not
really
antagonizing
it
is
to
presuppose
that
it
is
capable
of
erring
and
as
i
have
already
said
to
you
such
suppositions
are
menaces
to
the
existence
of
colonial
governments
the
common
crowd
overlooks
this
and
the
young
men
who
set
to
work
thoughtlessly
do
not
know
do
not
comprehend
do
not
try
to
comprehend
the
of
asking
the
menace
to
order
there
is
in
that
idea
pardon
me
interrupted
isagani
offended
by
the
arguments
the
jurist
was
using
with
him
but
when
by
legal
methods
people
ask
a
government
for
something
it
is
because
they
think
it
good
and
disposed
to
grant
a
blessing
and
such
action
instead
of
irritating
it
should
flatter
it
to
the
mother
one
appeals
never
to
the
stepmother
the
government
in
my
humble
opinion
is
not
an
omniscient
being
that
can
see
and
anticipate
everything
and
even
if
it
could
it
ought
not
to
feel
offended
for
here
you
have
the
church
itself
doing
nothing
but
asking
and
begging
of
god
who
sees
and
knows
everything
and
you
yourself
ask
and
demand
many
things
in
the
courts
of
this
same
government
yet
neither
god
nor
the
courts
have
yet
taken
offense
every
one
realizes
that
the
government
being
the
human
institution
that
it
is
needs
the
support
of
all
the
people
it
needs
to
be
made
to
see
and
feel
the
reality
of
things
you
yourself
are
not
convinced
of
the
truth
of
your
objection
you
yourself
know
that
it
is
a
tyrannical
and
despotic
government
which
in
order
to
make
a
display
of
force
and
independence
denies
everything
through
fear
or
distrust
and
that
the
tyrannized
and
enslaved
peoples
are
the
only
ones
whose
duty
it
is
never
to
ask
for
anything
a
people
that
hates
its
government
ought
to
ask
for
nothing
but
that
it
abdicate
its
power
the
old
lawyer
grimaced
and
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
sign
of
discontent
while
he
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
bald
pate
and
said
in
a
tone
of
condescending
pity
ahem
those
are
bad
doctrines
bad
theories
ahem
how
plain
it
is
that
you
are
young
and
inexperienced
in
life
look
what
is
happening
with
the
inexperienced
young
men
who
in
madrid
are
asking
for
so
many
reforms
they
are
accused
of
filibusterism
many
of
them
do
dare
return
here
and
yet
what
are
they
asking
for
things
holy
ancient
and
recognized
as
quite
harmless
but
there
are
matters
that
ca
be
explained
they
so
delicate
let
see
i
confess
to
you
that
there
are
other
reasons
besides
those
expressed
that
might
lead
a
sensible
government
to
deny
systematically
the
wishes
of
the
people
no
but
it
may
happen
that
we
find
ourselves
under
rulers
so
fatuous
and
ridiculous
but
there
are
always
other
reasons
even
though
what
is
asked
be
quite
just
different
governments
encounter
different
conditions
the
old
man
hesitated
stared
fixedly
at
isagani
and
then
with
a
sudden
resolution
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
as
though
he
would
dispel
some
idea
i
can
guess
what
you
mean
said
isagani
smiling
sadly
you
mean
that
a
colonial
government
for
the
very
reason
that
it
is
imperfectly
constituted
and
that
it
is
based
on
premises
no
no
not
that
no
quickly
interrupted
the
old
lawyer
as
he
sought
for
something
among
his
papers
no
i
meant
but
where
are
my
spectacles
there
they
are
replied
isagani
the
old
man
put
them
on
and
pretended
to
look
over
some
papers
but
seeing
that
the
youth
was
waiting
he
mumbled
i
wanted
to
tell
you
something
i
wanted
to
say
but
it
has
slipped
from
my
mind
you
interrupted
me
in
your
eagerness
but
it
was
an
insignificant
matter
if
you
only
knew
what
a
whirl
my
head
is
in
i
have
so
much
to
do
isagani
understood
that
he
was
being
dismissed
so
he
said
rising
we
ah
you
will
do
well
to
leave
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
government
which
will
settle
it
as
it
sees
fit
you
say
that
the
is
opposed
to
the
teaching
of
castilian
perhaps
he
may
be
not
as
to
the
fact
but
as
to
the
form
it
is
said
that
the
rector
who
is
on
his
way
will
bring
a
project
for
reform
in
education
wait
a
while
give
time
a
chance
apply
yourself
to
your
studies
as
the
examinations
are
near
and
you
who
already
speak
castilian
and
express
yourself
easily
what
are
you
bothering
yourself
about
what
interest
have
you
in
seeing
it
specially
taught
surely
padre
florentino
thinks
as
i
do
give
him
my
regards
my
uncle
replied
isagani
has
always
admonished
me
to
think
of
others
as
much
as
of
myself
i
did
come
for
myself
i
came
in
the
name
of
those
who
are
in
worse
condition
what
the
devil
let
them
do
as
you
have
done
let
them
singe
their
eyebrows
studying
and
come
to
be
bald
like
myself
stuffing
whole
paragraphs
into
their
memories
i
believe
that
if
you
talk
spanish
it
is
because
you
have
studied
it
you
not
of
manila
or
of
spanish
parents
then
let
them
learn
it
as
you
have
and
do
as
i
have
done
i
been
a
servant
to
all
the
friars
i
prepared
their
chocolate
and
while
with
my
right
hand
i
stirred
it
with
the
left
i
held
a
grammar
i
learned
and
thank
god
have
never
needed
other
teachers
or
academies
or
permits
from
the
government
believe
me
he
who
wishes
to
learn
learns
and
becomes
wise
but
how
many
among
those
who
wish
to
learn
come
to
be
what
you
are
one
in
ten
thousand
and
more
pish
why
any
more
retorted
the
old
man
shrugging
his
shoulders
there
are
too
many
lawyers
now
many
of
them
become
mere
clerks
doctors
they
insult
and
abuse
one
another
and
even
kill
each
other
in
competition
for
a
patient
laborers
sir
laborers
are
what
we
need
for
agriculture
isagani
realized
that
he
was
losing
time
but
still
could
not
forbear
replying
undoubtedly
there
are
many
doctors
and
lawyers
but
i
say
there
are
too
many
since
we
have
towns
that
lack
them
entirely
and
if
they
do
abound
in
quantity
perhaps
they
are
deficient
in
quality
since
the
young
men
ca
be
prevented
from
studying
and
no
other
professions
are
open
to
us
why
let
them
waste
their
time
and
effort
and
if
the
instruction
deficient
as
it
is
does
not
keep
many
from
becoming
lawyers
and
doctors
if
we
must
finally
have
them
why
not
have
good
ones
after
all
even
if
the
sole
wish
is
to
make
the
country
a
country
of
farmers
and
laborers
and
condemn
in
it
all
intellectual
activity
i
do
see
any
evil
in
enlightening
those
same
farmers
and
laborers
in
giving
them
at
least
an
education
that
will
aid
them
in
perfecting
themselves
and
in
perfecting
their
work
in
placing
them
in
a
condition
to
understand
many
things
of
which
they
are
at
present
ignorant
bah
bah
bah
exclaimed
the
lawyer
drawing
circles
in
the
air
with
his
hand
to
dispel
the
ideas
suggested
to
be
a
good
farmer
no
great
amount
of
rhetoric
is
needed
dreams
illusions
fancies
eh
will
you
take
a
piece
of
advice
he
arose
and
placed
his
hand
affectionately
on
the
youth
shoulder
as
he
continued
i
going
to
give
you
one
and
a
very
good
one
because
i
see
that
you
are
intelligent
and
the
advice
will
not
be
wasted
you
going
to
study
medicine
well
confine
yourself
to
learning
how
to
put
on
plasters
and
apply
leeches
and
do
ever
try
to
improve
or
impair
the
condition
of
your
kind
when
you
become
a
licentiate
marry
a
rich
and
devout
girl
try
to
make
cures
and
charge
well
shun
everything
that
has
any
relation
to
the
general
state
of
the
country
attend
mass
confession
and
communion
when
the
rest
do
and
you
will
see
afterwards
how
you
will
thank
me
and
i
shall
see
it
if
i
am
still
alive
always
remember
that
charity
begins
at
home
for
man
ought
not
to
seek
on
earth
more
than
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
for
himself
as
bentham
says
if
you
involve
yourself
in
quixotisms
you
will
have
no
career
nor
will
you
get
married
nor
will
you
ever
amount
to
anything
all
will
abandon
you
your
own
countrymen
will
be
the
first
to
laugh
at
your
simplicity
believe
me
you
will
remember
me
and
see
that
i
am
right
when
you
have
gray
hairs
like
myself
gray
hairs
such
as
these
here
the
old
lawyer
stroked
his
scanty
white
hair
as
he
smiled
sadly
and
shook
his
head
when
i
have
gray
hairs
like
those
sir
replied
isagani
with
equal
sadness
and
turn
my
gaze
back
over
my
past
and
see
that
i
have
worked
only
for
myself
without
having
done
what
i
plainly
could
and
should
have
done
for
the
country
that
has
given
me
everything
for
the
citizens
that
have
helped
me
to
live
then
sir
every
gray
hair
will
be
a
thorn
and
instead
of
rejoicing
they
will
shame
me
so
saying
he
took
his
leave
with
a
profound
bow
the
lawyer
remained
motionless
in
his
place
with
an
amazed
look
on
his
face
he
listened
to
the
footfalls
that
gradually
died
away
then
resumed
his
seat
poor
boy
he
murmured
similar
thoughts
also
crossed
my
mind
once
what
more
could
any
one
desire
than
to
be
able
to
say
have
done
this
for
the
good
of
the
fatherland
i
have
consecrated
my
life
to
the
welfare
of
others
a
crown
of
laurel
steeped
in
aloes
dry
leaves
that
cover
thorns
and
worms
that
is
not
life
that
does
not
get
us
our
daily
bread
nor
does
it
bring
us
honors
the
laurel
would
hardly
serve
for
a
salad
nor
produce
ease
nor
aid
us
in
winning
lawsuits
but
quite
the
reverse
every
country
has
its
code
of
ethics
as
it
has
its
climate
and
its
diseases
different
from
the
climate
and
the
diseases
of
other
countries
after
a
pause
he
added
poor
boy
if
all
should
think
and
act
as
he
does
i
do
say
but

the
tribulations
of
a
chinese
in
the
evening
of
that
same
saturday
quiroga
the
chinese
who
aspired
to
the
creation
of
a
consulate
for
his
nation
gave
a
dinner
in
the
rooms
over
his
bazaar
located
in
the
escolta
his
feast
was
well
attended
friars
government
employees
soldiers
merchants
all
of
them
his
customers
partners
or
patrons
were
to
be
seen
there
for
his
store
supplied
the
curates
and
the
conventos
with
all
their
necessities
he
accepted
the
chits
of
all
the
employees
and
he
had
servants
who
were
discreet
prompt
and
complaisant
the
friars
themselves
did
not
disdain
to
pass
whole
hours
in
his
store
sometimes
in
view
of
the
public
sometimes
in
the
chambers
with
agreeable
company
that
night
then
the
sala
presented
a
curious
aspect
being
filled
with
friars
and
clerks
seated
on
vienna
chairs
stools
of
black
wood
and
marble
benches
of
cantonese
origin
before
little
square
tables
playing
cards
or
conversing
among
themselves
under
the
brilliant
glare
of
the
gilt
chandeliers
or
the
subdued
light
of
the
chinese
lanterns
which
were
brilliantly
decorated
with
long
silken
tassels
on
the
walls
there
was
a
lamentable
medley
of
landscapes
in
dim
and
gaudy
colors
painted
in
canton
or
hongkong
mingled
with
tawdry
chromos
of
odalisks
women
effeminate
lithographs
of
christ
the
deaths
of
the
just
and
of
the
sinners
made
by
jewish
houses
in
germany
to
be
sold
in
the
catholic
countries
nor
were
there
lacking
the
chinese
prints
on
red
paper
representing
a
man
seated
of
venerable
aspect
with
a
calm
smiling
face
behind
whom
stood
a
servant
ugly
horrible
diabolical
threatening
armed
with
a
lance
having
a
wide
keen
blade
among
the
indians
some
call
this
figure
mohammed
others
santiago
we
do
not
know
why
nor
do
the
chinese
themselves
give
a
very
clear
explanation
of
this
popular
pair
the
pop
of
champagne
corks
the
rattle
of
glasses
laughter
cigar
smoke
and
that
odor
peculiar
to
a
chinese
habitation
a
mixture
of
punk
opium
and
dried
fruits
completed
the
collection
dressed
as
a
chinese
mandarin
in
a
cap
quiroga
moved
from
room
to
room
stiff
and
straight
but
casting
watchful
glances
here
and
there
as
though
to
assure
himself
that
nothing
was
being
stolen
yet
in
spite
of
this
natural
distrust
he
exchanged
handshakes
with
each
guest
greeted
some
with
a
smile
sagacious
and
humble
others
with
a
patronizing
air
and
still
others
with
a
certain
shrewd
look
that
seemed
to
say
i
know
you
did
come
on
my
account
you
came
for
the
dinner
and
quiroga
was
right
that
fat
gentleman
who
is
now
praising
him
and
speaking
of
the
advisability
of
a
chinese
consulate
in
manila
intimating
that
to
manage
it
there
could
be
no
one
but
quiroga
is
the
señor
gonzalez
who
hides
behind
the
pseudonym
when
he
attacks
chinese
immigration
through
the
columns
of
the
newspapers
that
other
an
elderly
man
who
closely
examines
the
lamps
pictures
and
other
furnishings
with
grimaces
and
ejaculations
of
disdain
is
don
timoteo
pelaez
juanito
father
a
merchant
who
inveighs
against
the
chinese
competition
that
is
ruining
his
business
the
one
over
there
that
thin
brown
individual
with
a
sharp
look
and
a
pale
smile
is
the
celebrated
originator
of
the
dispute
over
mexican
pesos
which
so
troubled
one
of
quiroga
protéges
that
government
clerk
is
regarded
in
manila
as
very
clever
that
one
farther
on
he
of
the
frowning
look
and
unkempt
mustache
is
a
government
official
who
passes
for
a
most
meritorious
fellow
because
he
has
the
courage
to
speak
ill
of
the
business
in
lottery
tickets
carried
on
between
quiroga
and
an
exalted
dame
in
manila
society
the
fact
is
that
two
thirds
of
the
tickets
go
to
china
and
the
few
that
are
left
in
manila
are
sold
at
a
premium
of
a
the
honorable
gentleman
entertains
the
conviction
that
some
day
he
will
draw
the
first
prize
and
is
in
a
rage
at
finding
himself
confronted
with
such
tricks
the
dinner
meanwhile
was
drawing
to
an
end
from
the
floated
into
the
sala
snatches
of
toasts
interruptions
bursts
and
ripples
of
laughter
the
name
of
quiroga
was
often
heard
mingled
with
the
words
consul
equality
justice
the
amphitryon
himself
did
not
eat
european
dishes
so
he
contented
himself
with
drinking
a
glass
of
wine
with
his
guests
from
time
to
time
promising
to
dine
with
those
who
were
not
seated
at
the
first
table
simoun
who
was
present
having
already
dined
was
in
the
sala
talking
with
some
merchants
who
were
complaining
of
business
conditions
everything
was
going
wrong
trade
was
paralyzed
the
european
exchanges
were
exorbitantly
high
they
sought
information
from
the
jeweler
or
insinuated
to
him
a
few
ideas
with
the
hope
that
these
would
be
communicated
to
the
to
all
the
remedies
suggested
simoun
responded
with
a
sarcastic
and
unfeeling
exclamation
about
nonsense
until
one
of
them
in
exasperation
asked
him
for
his
opinion
my
opinion
he
retorted
study
how
other
nations
prosper
and
then
do
as
they
do
and
why
do
they
prosper
señor
simoun
simoun
replied
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
the
port
works
which
weigh
so
heavily
upon
commerce
and
the
port
not
yet
completed
sighed
don
timoteo
pelaez
a
penelope
web
as
my
son
says
that
is
spun
and
unspun
the
taxes
you
complaining
exclaimed
another
just
as
the
general
has
decreed
the
destruction
of
houses
of
light
materials
and
you
with
a
shipment
of
galvanized
iron
yes
rejoined
don
timoteo
but
look
what
that
decree
cost
me
then
the
destruction
will
not
be
carried
out
for
a
month
not
until
lent
begins
and
other
shipments
may
arrive
i
would
have
wished
them
destroyed
right
away
but
besides
what
are
the
owners
of
those
houses
going
to
buy
from
me
if
they
are
all
poor
all
equally
beggars
you
can
always
buy
up
their
shacks
for
a
trifle
and
afterwards
have
the
decree
revoked
and
sell
them
back
at
double
the
price
that
business
simoun
smiled
his
frigid
smile
seeing
quiroga
approach
he
left
the
querulous
merchants
to
greet
the
future
consul
who
on
catching
sight
of
him
lost
his
satisfied
expression
and
assigned
a
countenance
like
those
of
the
merchants
while
he
bent
almost
double
quiroga
respected
the
jeweler
greatly
not
only
because
he
knew
him
to
be
very
wealthy
but
also
on
account
of
his
rumored
influence
with
the
it
was
reported
that
simoun
favored
quiroga
ambitions
that
he
was
an
advocate
for
the
consulate
and
a
certain
newspaper
hostile
to
the
chinese
had
alluded
to
him
in
many
paraphrases
veiled
allusions
and
suspension
points
in
the
celebrated
controversy
with
another
sheet
that
was
favorable
to
the
queued
folk
some
prudent
persons
added
with
winks
and
words
that
his
black
eminence
was
advising
the
general
to
avail
himself
of
the
chinese
in
order
to
humble
the
tenacious
pride
of
the
natives
to
hold
the
people
in
subjection
he
was
reported
to
have
said
there
nothing
like
humiliating
them
and
humbling
them
in
their
own
eyes
to
this
end
an
opportunity
had
soon
presented
itself
the
guilds
of
mestizos
and
natives
were
continually
watching
one
another
venting
their
bellicose
spirits
and
their
activities
in
jealousy
and
distrust
at
mass
one
day
the
gobernadorcillo
of
the
natives
was
seated
on
a
bench
to
the
right
and
being
extremely
thin
happened
to
cross
one
of
his
legs
over
the
other
thus
adopting
a
nonchalant
attitude
in
order
to
expose
his
thighs
more
and
display
his
pretty
shoes
the
gobernadorcillo
of
the
guild
of
mestizos
who
was
seated
on
the
opposite
bench
as
he
had
bunions
and
could
not
cross
his
legs
on
account
of
his
obesity
spread
his
legs
wide
apart
to
expose
a
plain
waistcoat
adorned
with
a
beautiful
gold
chain
set
with
diamonds
the
two
cliques
comprehended
these
maneuvers
and
joined
battle
on
the
following
sunday
all
the
mestizos
even
the
thinnest
had
large
paunches
and
spread
their
legs
wide
apart
as
though
on
horseback
while
the
natives
placed
one
leg
over
the
other
even
the
fattest
there
being
one
cabeza
de
barangay
who
turned
a
somersault
seeing
these
movements
the
chinese
all
adopted
their
own
peculiar
attitude
that
of
sitting
as
they
do
in
their
shops
with
one
leg
drawn
back
and
upward
the
other
swinging
loose
there
resulted
protests
and
petitions
the
police
rushed
to
arms
ready
to
start
a
civil
war
the
curates
rejoiced
the
spaniards
were
amused
and
made
money
out
of
everybody
until
the
general
settled
the
quarrel
by
ordering
that
every
one
should
sit
as
the
chinese
did
since
they
were
the
heaviest
contributors
even
though
they
were
not
the
best
catholics
the
difficulty
for
the
mestizos
and
natives
then
was
that
their
trousers
were
too
tight
to
permit
of
their
imitating
the
chinese
but
to
make
the
intention
of
humiliating
them
the
more
evident
the
measure
was
carried
out
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
the
church
being
surrounded
by
a
troop
of
cavalry
while
all
those
within
were
sweating
the
matter
was
carried
to
the
cortes
but
it
was
repeated
that
the
chinese
as
the
ones
who
paid
should
have
their
way
in
the
religious
ceremonies
even
though
they
apostatized
and
laughed
at
christianity
immediately
after
the
natives
and
the
mestizos
had
to
be
content
learning
thus
not
to
waste
time
over
such
fatuity
quiroga
with
his
smooth
tongue
and
humble
smile
was
lavishly
and
flatteringly
attentive
to
simoun
his
voice
was
caressing
and
his
bows
numerous
but
the
jeweler
cut
his
blandishments
short
by
asking
brusquely
did
the
bracelets
suit
her
at
this
question
all
quiroga
liveliness
vanished
like
a
dream
his
caressing
voice
became
plaintive
he
bowed
lower
gave
the
chinese
salutation
of
raising
his
clasped
hands
to
the
height
of
his
face
and
groaned
ah
señor
simoun
i
lost
i
ruined
how
quiroga
lost
and
ruined
when
you
have
so
many
bottles
of
champagne
and
so
many
guests
quiroga
closed
his
eyes
and
made
a
grimace
yes
the
affair
of
that
afternoon
that
affair
of
the
bracelets
had
ruined
him
simoun
smiled
for
when
a
chinese
merchant
complains
it
is
because
all
is
going
well
and
when
he
makes
a
show
that
things
are
booming
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
is
planning
an
assignment
or
flight
to
his
own
country
you
did
know
that
i
lost
i
ruined
ah
señor
simoun
to
make
his
condition
plainer
he
illustrated
the
word
by
making
a
movement
as
though
he
were
falling
in
collapse
simoun
wanted
to
laugh
but
restrained
himself
and
said
that
he
knew
nothing
nothing
at
all
as
quiroga
led
him
to
a
room
and
closed
the
door
he
then
explained
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
three
diamond
bracelets
that
he
had
secured
from
simoun
on
pretense
of
showing
them
to
his
wife
were
not
for
her
a
poor
native
shut
up
in
her
room
like
a
chinese
woman
but
for
a
beautiful
and
charming
lady
the
friend
of
a
powerful
man
whose
influence
was
needed
by
him
in
a
certain
deal
in
which
he
could
clear
some
six
thousand
pesos
as
he
did
not
understand
feminine
tastes
and
wished
to
be
gallant
the
chinese
had
asked
for
the
three
finest
bracelets
the
jeweler
had
each
priced
at
three
to
four
thousand
pesos
with
affected
simplicity
and
his
most
caressing
smile
quiroga
had
begged
the
lady
to
select
the
one
she
liked
best
and
the
lady
more
simple
and
caressing
still
had
declared
that
she
liked
all
three
and
had
kept
them
simoun
burst
out
into
laughter
ah
sir
i
lost
i
ruined
cried
the
chinese
slapping
himself
lightly
with
his
delicate
hands
but
the
jeweler
continued
his
laughter
ugh
bad
people
surely
not
a
real
lady
went
on
the
chinaman
shaking
his
head
in
disgust
what
she
has
no
decency
while
me
a
chinaman
me
always
polite
ah
surely
she
not
a
real
lady
a
has
more
decency
they
caught
you
they
caught
you
exclaimed
simoun
poking
him
in
the
chest
and
everybody
asking
for
loans
and
never
pays
what
about
that
clerks
officials
lieutenants
soldiers
he
checked
them
off
on
his
fingers
ah
señor
simoun
i
lost
i
get
out
with
your
complaints
said
simoun
i
saved
you
from
many
officials
that
wanted
money
from
you
i
lent
it
to
them
so
that
they
would
bother
you
even
when
i
knew
that
they
could
pay
but
señor
simoun
you
lend
to
officials
i
lend
to
women
sailors
everybody
i
bet
you
get
your
money
back

ah
surely
you
do
understand
when
it
lost
in
gambling
they
never

besides
you
have
a
consul
you
can
force
them
but
i
have
simoun
became
thoughtful
listen
quiroga
he
said
somewhat
abstractedly
i
undertake
to
collect
what
the
officers
and
sailors
owe
you
give
me
their
notes
quiroga
again
fell
to
whining
they
had
never
given
him
any
notes
when
they
come
to
you
asking
for
money
send
them
to
me
i
want
to
help
you
the
grateful
quiroga
thanked
him
but
soon
fell
to
lamenting
again
about
the
bracelets
a
would
be
so
shameless
he
repeated
the
devil
exclaimed
simoun
looking
askance
at
the
chinese
as
though
studying
him
exactly
when
i
need
the
money
and
thought
that
you
could
pay
me
but
it
can
all
be
arranged
as
i
do
want
you
to
fail
for
such
a
small
amount
come
a
favor
and
i
reduce
to
seven
the
nine
thousand
pesos
you
owe
me

wish
through
the
customs

of
lamps

copper
glassware

pesos

arms

the
conventos

the
chinese
nodded
affirmation
but
remarked
that
he
had
to
do
a
good
deal
of
bribing
i
furnish
the
padres
everything
well
then
added
simoun
in
a
low
voice
i
need
you
to
get
in
for
me
some
boxes
of
rifles
that
arrived
this
evening
i
want
you
to
keep
them
in
your
warehouse
there
is
room
for
all
of
them
in
my
house
quiroga
began
to
show
symptoms
of
fright
do
get
scared
you
do
run
any
risk
these
rifles
are
to
be
concealed
a
few
at
a
time
in
various
dwellings
then
a
search
will
be
instituted
and
many
people
will
be
sent
to
prison
you
and
i
can
make
a
haul
getting
them
set
free
understand
me
quiroga
wavered
for
he
was
afraid
of
firearms
in
his
desk
he
had
an
empty
revolver
that
he
never
touched
without
turning
his
head
away
and
closing
his
eyes
if
you
ca
do
it
i
have
to
apply
to
some
one
else
but
then
need
the
nine
thousand
pesos
to
cross
their
palms
and
shut
their
eyes
all
right
all
right
quiroga
finally
agreed
but
many
people
will
be
arrested
there
be
a
search
eh
when
quiroga
and
simoun
returned
to
the
sala
they
found
there
in
animated
conversation
those
who
had
finished
their
dinner
for
the
champagne
had
loosened
their
tongues
and
stirred
their
brains
they
were
talking
rather
freely
in
a
group
where
there
were
a
number
of
government
clerks
some
ladies
and
don
custodio
the
topic
was
a
commission
sent
to
india
to
make
certain
investigations
about
footwear
for
the
soldiers
who
compose
it
asked
an
elderly
lady
a
colonel
two
other
officers
and
his
excellency
nephew
four
rejoined
a
clerk
what
a
commission
suppose
they
disagree
are
they
competent
that
what
i
asked
replied
a
clerk
it
said
that
one
civilian
ought
to
go
one
who
has
no
military
prejudices
a
shoemaker
for
instance
that
right
added
an
importer
of
shoes
but
it
would
do
to
send
an
indian
or
a
chinaman
and
the
only
peninsular
shoemaker
demanded
such
large
fees
but
why
do
they
have
to
make
any
investigations
about
footwear
inquired
the
elderly
lady
it
is
for
the
peninsular
artillerymen
the
indian
soldiers
can
go
barefoot
as
they
do
in
their
towns
exactly
so
and
the
treasury
would
save
more
corroborated
another
lady
a
widow
who
was
not
satisfied
with
her
pension
but
you
must
remember
remarked
another
in
the
group
a
friend
of
the
officers
on
the
commission
that
while
it
true
they
go
barefoot
in
the
towns
it
not
the
same
as
moving
about
under
orders
in
the
service
they
ca
choose
the
hour
nor
the
road
nor
rest
when
they
wish
remember
madam
that
with
the
noonday
sun
overhead
and
the
earth
below
baking
like
an
oven
they
have
to
march
over
sandy
stretches
where
there
are
stones
the
sun
above
and
fire
below
bullets
in
front
it
only
a
question
of
getting
used
to
it
like
the
donkey
that
got
used
to
not
eating
in
our
present
campaign
the
greater
part
of
our
losses
have
been
due
to
wounds
on
the
soles
of
the
feet
remember
the
donkey
madam
remember
the
donkey
but
my
dear
sir
retorted
the
lady
look
how
much
money
is
wasted
on
there
enough
to
pension
many
widows
and
orphans
in
order
to
maintain
our
prestige
do
smile
for
i
not
talking
about
myself
and
i
have
my
pension
even
though
a
very
small
one
insignificant
considering
the
services
my
husband
rendered
but
talking
of
others
who
are
dragging
out
miserable
lives
it
not
right
that
after
so
much
persuasion
to
come
and
so
many
hardships
in
crossing
the
sea
they
should
end
here
by
dying
of
hunger
what
you
say
about
the
soldiers
may
be
true
but
the
fact
is
that
i
been
in
the
country
more
than
three
years
and
i
have
seen
any
soldier
limping
in
that
i
agree
with
the
lady
said
her
neighbor
why
issue
them
shoes
when
they
were
born
without
them
and
why
shirts
and
why
trousers
just
calculate
what
we
should
economize
on
soldiers
clothed
only
in
their
skins
concluded
he
who
was
defending
the
army
in
another
group
the
conversation
was
more
heated
was
talking
and
declaiming
while
padre
camorra
as
usual
was
constantly
interrupting
him
the
in
spite
of
his
respect
for
the
cowled
gentry
was
always
at
loggerheads
with
padre
camorra
whom
he
regarded
as
a
silly
thus
giving
himself
the
appearance
of
being
independent
and
refuting
the
accusations
of
those
who
called
him
fray
ibañez
padre
camorra
liked
his
adversary
as
the
latter
was
the
only
person
who
would
take
seriously
what
he
styled
his
arguments
they
were
discussing
magnetism
spiritualism
magic
and
the
like
their
words
flew
through
the
air
like
the
knives
and
balls
of
jugglers
tossed
back
and
forth
from
one
to
the
other
that
year
great
attention
had
been
attracted
in
the
quiapo
fair
by
a
head
wrongly
called
a
sphinx
exhibited
by
leeds
an
american
glaring
advertisements
covered
the
walls
of
the
houses
mysterious
and
funereal
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
public
neither
nor
any
of
the
padres
had
yet
seen
it
juanito
pelaez
was
the
only
one
who
had
and
he
was
describing
his
wonderment
to
the
party
as
a
journalist
looked
for
a
natural
explanation
padre
camorra
talked
of
the
devil
padre
irene
smiled
padre
salvi
remained
grave
but
padre
the
devil
does
need
to
come
we
are
sufficient
to
damn
ourselves
it
ca
be
explained
any
other
way
if
science
get
out
with
science
but
listen
to
me
and
i
convince
you
it
all
a
question
of
optics
i
have
yet
seen
the
head
nor
do
i
know
how
it
looks
but
this
gentleman
indicating
juanito
pelaez
tells
us
that
it
does
not
look
like
the
talking
heads
that
are
usually
exhibited
so
be
it
but
the
principle
is
the
same
it
all
a
question
of
optics
wait
a
mirror
is
placed
thus
another
mirror
behind
it
the
image
is
reflected
i
say
it
is
purely
a
problem
in
physics
taking
down
from
the
walls
several
mirrors
he
arranged
them
turned
them
round
and
round
but
not
getting
the
desired
result
concluded
as
i
say
it
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
question
of
optics
but
what
do
you
want
mirrors
for
if
juanito
tells
us
that
the
head
is
inside
a
box
placed
on
the
table
i
see
in
it
spiritualism
because
the
spiritualists
always
make
use
of
tables
and
i
think
that
padre
salvi
as
the
ecclesiastical
governor
ought
to
prohibit
the
exhibition
padre
salvi
remained
silent
saying
neither
yes
nor
no
in
order
to
learn
if
there
are
devils
or
mirrors
inside
it
suggested
simoun
the
best
thing
would
be
for
you
to
go
and
see
the
famous
sphinx
the
proposal
was
a
good
one
so
it
was
accepted
although
padre
salvi
and
don
custodio
showed
some
repugnance
they
at
a
fair
to
rub
shoulders
with
the
public
to
see
sphinxes
and
talking
heads
what
would
the
natives
say
these
might
take
them
for
mere
men
endowed
with
the
same
passions
and
weaknesses
as
others
but
with
his
journalistic
ingenuity
promised
to
request
leeds
not
to
admit
the
public
while
they
were
inside
they
would
be
honoring
him
sufficiently
by
the
visit
not
to
admit
of
his
refusal
and
besides
he
would
not
charge
any
admission
fee
to
give
a
show
of
probability
to
this
he
concluded
because
remember
if
i
should
expose
the
trick
of
the
mirrors
to
the
public
it
would
ruin
the
poor
business
was
a
conscientious
individual
about
a
dozen
set
out
among
them
our
acquaintances
padres
salvi
camorra
and
irene
don
custodio
and
juanito
pelaez
their
carriages
set
them
down
at
the
entrance
to
the
quiapo
plaza
chapter
xvii
the
quiapo
fair
it
was
a
beautiful
night
and
the
plaza
presented
a
most
animated
aspect
taking
advantage
of
the
freshness
of
the
breeze
and
the
splendor
of
the
january
moon
the
people
filled
the
fair
to
see
be
seen
and
amuse
themselves
the
music
of
the
cosmoramas
and
the
lights
of
the
lanterns
gave
life
and
merriment
to
every
one
long
rows
of
booths
brilliant
with
tinsel
and
gauds
exposed
to
view
clusters
of
balls
masks
strung
by
the
eyes
tin
toys
trains
carts
mechanical
horses
carriages
with
diminutive
boilers
lilliputian
tableware
of
porcelain
pine
nativities
dolls
both
foreign
and
domestic
the
former
red
and
smiling
the
latter
sad
and
pensive
like
little
ladies
beside
gigantic
children
the
beating
of
drums
the
roar
of
tin
horns
the
wheezy
music
of
the
accordions
and
the
all
mingled
in
a
carnival
concert
amid
the
coming
and
going
of
the
crowd
pushing
stumbling
over
one
another
with
their
faces
turned
toward
the
booths
so
that
the
collisions
were
frequent
and
often
amusing
the
carriages
were
forced
to
move
slowly
with
the
of
the
cocheros
repeated
every
moment
met
and
mingled
government
clerks
soldiers
friars
students
chinese
girls
with
their
mammas
or
aunts
all
greeting
signaling
calling
to
one
another
merrily
padre
camorra
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
at
the
sight
of
so
many
pretty
girls
he
stopped
looked
back
nudged
chuckled
and
swore
saying
and
that
one
and
that
one
my
and
that
one
over
there
what
say
you
in
his
contentment
he
even
fell
to
using
the
familiar
toward
his
friend
and
adversary
padre
salvi
stared
at
him
from
time
to
time
but
he
took
little
note
of
padre
salvi
on
the
contrary
he
pretended
to
stumble
so
that
he
might
brush
against
the
girls
he
winked
and
made
eyes
at
them
he
kept
saying
to
himself
when
shall
i
be
the
curate
of
quiapo
suddenly
let
go
an
oath
jumped
aside
and
slapped
his
hand
on
his
arm
padre
camorra
in
his
excess
of
enthusiasm
had
pinched
him
they
were
approaching
a
dazzling
señorita
who
was
attracting
the
attention
of
the
whole
plaza
and
padre
camorra
unable
to
restrain
his
delight
had
taken
arm
as
a
substitute
for
the
girl
it
was
paulita
gomez
the
prettiest
of
the
pretty
in
company
with
isagani
followed
by
doña
victorina
the
young
woman
was
resplendent
in
her
beauty
all
stopped
and
craned
their
necks
while
they
ceased
their
conversation
and
followed
her
with
their
eyes
even
doña
victorina
was
respectfully
saluted
paulita
was
arrayed
in
a
rich
camisa
and
pañuelo
of
embroidered
piña
different
from
those
she
had
worn
that
morning
to
the
church
the
gauzy
texture
of
the
piña
set
off
her
shapely
head
and
the
indians
who
saw
her
compared
her
to
the
moon
surrounded
by
fleecy
clouds
a
silk
skirt
caught
up
in
rich
and
graceful
folds
by
her
little
hand
gave
majesty
to
her
erect
figure
the
movement
of
which
harmonizing
with
her
curving
neck
displayed
all
the
triumphs
of
vanity
and
satisfied
coquetry
isagani
appeared
to
be
rather
disgusted
for
so
many
curious
eyes
fixed
upon
the
beauty
of
his
sweetheart
annoyed
him
the
stares
seemed
to
him
robbery
and
the
girl
smiles
faithlessness
juanito
saw
her
and
his
hump
increased
when
he
spoke
to
her
paulita
replied
negligently
while
doña
victorina
called
to
him
for
juanito
was
her
favorite
she
preferring
him
to
isagani
what
a
girl
what
a
girl
muttered
the
entranced
padre
camorra
come
padre
pinch
yourself
and
let
me
alone
said
fretfully
what
a
girl
what
a
girl
repeated
the
friar
and
she
has
for
a
sweetheart
a
pupil
of
mine
the
boy
i
had
the
quarrel
with
just
my
luck
that
she
not
of
my
town
he
added
after
turning
his
head
several
times
to
follow
her
with
his
looks
he
was
even
tempted
to
leave
his
companions
to
follow
the
girl
and
had
difficulty
in
dissuading
him
paulita
beautiful
figure
moved
on
her
graceful
little
head
nodding
with
inborn
coquetry
our
promenaders
kept
on
their
way
not
without
sighs
on
the
part
of
the
until
they
reached
a
booth
surrounded
by
sightseers
who
quickly
made
way
for
them
it
was
a
shop
of
little
wooden
figures
of
local
manufacture
representing
in
all
shapes
and
sizes
the
costumes
races
and
occupations
of
the
country
indians
spaniards
chinese
mestizos
friars
clergymen
government
clerks
gobernadorcillos
students
soldiers
and
so
on
whether
the
artists
had
more
affection
for
the
priests
the
folds
of
whose
habits
were
better
suited
to
their
esthetic
purposes
or
whether
the
friars
holding
such
an
important
place
in
philippine
life
engaged
the
attention
of
the
sculptor
more
the
fact
was
that
for
one
cause
or
another
images
of
them
abounded
and
finished
representing
them
in
the
sublimest
moments
of
their
lives
the
opposite
of
what
is
done
in
europe
where
they
are
pictured
as
sleeping
on
casks
of
wine
playing
cards
emptying
tankards
rousing
themselves
to
gaiety
or
patting
the
cheeks
of
a
buxom
girl
no
the
friars
of
the
philippines
were
different
elegant
handsome
their
tonsures
neatly
shaven
their
features
symmetrical
and
serene
their
gaze
meditative
their
expression
saintly
somewhat
cane
in
hand
and
shoes
on
their
feet
inviting
adoration
and
a
place
in
a
glass
case
instead
of
the
symbols
of
gluttony
and
incontinence
of
their
brethren
in
europe
those
of
manila
carried
the
book
the
crucifix
and
the
palm
of
martyrdom
instead
of
kissing
the
simple
country
lasses
those
of
manila
gravely
extended
the
hand
to
be
kissed
by
children
and
grown
men
doubled
over
almost
to
kneeling
instead
of
the
full
refectory
and
their
stage
in
europe
in
manila
they
had
the
oratory
the
instead
of
the
mendicant
friar
who
goes
from
door
to
door
with
his
donkey
and
sack
begging
alms
the
friars
of
the
philippines
scattered
gold
from
full
hands
among
the
miserable
indians
look
here
padre
camorra
exclaimed
upon
whom
the
effect
of
the
champagne
still
lingered
he
pointed
to
a
picture
of
a
lean
friar
of
thoughtful
mien
who
was
seated
at
a
table
with
his
head
resting
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
apparently
writing
a
sermon
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
the
contrast
suggested
drew
laughter
from
the
crowd
padre
camorra
who
had
already
forgotten
about
paulita
saw
what
was
meant
and
laughing
his
clownish
laugh
asked
in
turn
whom
does
this
other
figure
resemble
it
was
an
old
woman
with
one
eye
with
disheveled
hair
seated
on
the
ground
like
an
indian
idol
ironing
clothes
the
was
carefully
imitated
being
of
copper
with
coals
of
red
tinsel
and
of
dirty
twisted
cotton
eh
it
was
a
fool
who
designed
that
asked
padre
camorra
with
a
laugh
well
i
do
see
the
point
replied
the
journalist
but
do
you
see
the
title
philippine
that
utensil
with
which
the
old
woman
is
ironing
is
here
called
the
press
all
laughed
at
this
himself
joining
in
two
soldiers
of
the
civil
guard
appropriately
labeled
were
placed
behind
a
man
who
was
tightly
bound
and
had
his
face
covered
by
his
hat
it
was
entitled
country
of
and
from
appearances
they
were
going
to
shoot
him
many
of
our
visitors
were
displeased
with
the
exhibition
they
talked
of
rules
of
art
they
sought
proportion
one
said
that
this
figure
did
not
have
seven
heads
that
the
face
lacked
a
nose
having
only
three
all
of
which
made
padre
camorra
somewhat
thoughtful
for
he
did
not
comprehend
how
a
figure
to
be
correct
need
have
four
noses
and
seven
heads
others
said
if
they
were
muscular
that
they
could
not
be
indians
still
others
remarked
that
it
was
not
sculpture
but
mere
carpentry
each
added
his
spoonful
of
criticism
until
padre
camorra
not
to
be
outdone
ventured
to
ask
for
at
least
thirty
legs
for
each
doll
because
if
the
others
wanted
noses
could
he
require
feet
so
they
fell
to
discussing
whether
the
indian
had
or
had
not
any
aptitude
for
sculpture
and
whether
it
would
be
advisable
to
encourage
that
art
until
there
arose
a
general
dispute
which
was
cut
short
by
don
custodio
declaration
that
the
indians
had
the
aptitude
but
that
they
should
devote
themselves
exclusively
to
the
manufacture
of
saints
one
would
say
observed
who
was
full
of
bright
ideas
that
night
that
this
chinaman
is
quiroga
but
on
close
examination
it
looks
like
padre
irene
and
what
do
you
say
about
that
british
indian
he
looks
like
simoun
fresh
peals
of
laughter
resounded
while
padre
irene
rubbed
his
nose
that
right
it
the
very
image
of
him
but
where
is
simoun
simoun
should
buy
it
but
the
jeweler
had
disappeared
unnoticed
by
any
one
exclaimed
padre
camorra
how
stingy
the
american
is
he
afraid
we
would
make
him
pay
the
admission
for
all
of
us
into
leeds
show
no
rejoined
what
he
afraid
of
is
that
he
compromise
himself
he
may
have
foreseen
the
joke
in
store
for
his
friend
leeds
and
has
got
out
of
the
way
thus
without
purchasing
the
least
trifle
they
continued
on
their
way
to
see
the
famous
sphinx
offered
to
manage
the
affair
for
the
american
would
not
rebuff
a
journalist
who
could
take
revenge
in
an
unfavorable
article
you
see
that
it
all
a
question
of
mirrors
he
said
because
you
see
again
he
plunged
into
a
long
demonstration
and
as
he
had
no
mirrors
at
hand
to
discredit
his
theory
he
tangled
himself
up
in
all
kinds
of
blunders
and
wound
up
by
not
knowing
himself
what
he
was
saying
in
short
you
see
how
it
all
a
question
of
optics

legerdemain
leeds
a
genuine
yankee
dressed
completely
in
black
received
his
visitors
with
great
deference
he
spoke
spanish
well
from
having
been
for
many
years
in
south
america
and
offered
no
objection
to
their
request
saying
that
they
might
examine
everything
both
before
and
after
the
exhibition
but
begged
that
they
remain
quiet
while
it
was
in
progress
smiled
in
pleasant
anticipation
of
the
vexation
he
had
prepared
for
the
american
the
room
hung
entirely
in
black
was
lighted
by
ancient
lamps
burning
alcohol
a
rail
wrapped
in
black
velvet
divided
it
into
two
almost
equal
parts
one
of
which
was
filled
with
seats
for
the
spectators
and
the
other
occupied
by
a
platform
covered
with
a
checkered
carpet
in
the
center
of
this
platform
was
placed
a
table
over
which
was
spread
a
piece
of
black
cloth
adorned
with
skulls
and
cabalistic
signs
the
en
was
therefore
lugubrious
and
had
its
effect
upon
the
merry
visitors
the
jokes
died
away
they
spoke
in
whispers
and
however
much
some
tried
to
appear
indifferent
their
lips
framed
no
smiles
all
felt
as
if
they
had
entered
a
house
where
there
was
a
corpse
an
illusion
accentuated
by
an
odor
of
wax
and
incense
don
custodio
and
padre
salvi
consulted
in
whispers
over
the
expediency
of
prohibiting
such
shows
in
order
to
cheer
the
dispirited
group
and
embarrass
leeds
said
to
him
in
a
familiar
tone
eh
mister
since
there
are
none
but
ourselves
here
and
we
are
indians
who
can
be
fooled
wo
you
let
us
see
the
trick
we
know
of
course
that
it
purely
a
question
of
optics
but
as
padre
camorra
wo
be
convinced
here
he
started
to
jump
over
the
rail
instead
of
going
through
the
proper
opening
while
padre
camorra
broke
out
into
protests
fearing
that
might
be
right
and
why
not
sir
rejoined
the
american
but
do
break
anything
will
you
the
journalist
was
already
on
the
platform
you
will
allow
me
then
he
asked
and
without
waiting
for
the
permission
fearing
that
it
might
not
be
granted
raised
the
cloth
to
look
for
the
mirrors
that
he
expected
should
be
between
the
legs
of
the
table
uttered
an
exclamation
and
stepped
back
again
placed
both
hands
under
the
table
and
waved
them
about
he
encountered
only
empty
space
the
table
had
three
thin
iron
legs
sunk
into
the
floor
the
journalist
looked
all
about
as
though
seeking
something
where
are
the
mirrors
asked
padre
camorra
looked
and
looked
felt
the
table
with
his
fingers
raised
the
cloth
again
and
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
from
time
to
time
as
if
trying
to
remember
something
have
you
lost
anything
inquired
leeds
the
mirrors
mister
where
are
the
mirrors
i
do
know
where
yours
are
mine
are
at
the
hotel
do
you
want
to
look
at
yourself
you
somewhat
pale
and
excited
many
laughed
in
spite
of
their
weird
impressions
on
seeing
the
jesting
coolness
of
the
american
while
retired
quite
abashed
to
his
seat
muttering
it
ca
be
you
see
that
he
does
do
it
without
mirrors
the
table
will
have
to
be
changed
later
leeds
placed
the
cloth
on
the
table
again
and
turning
toward
his
illustrious
audience
asked
them
are
you
satisfied
may
we
begin
hurry
up
how
he
is
said
the
widow
then
ladies
and
gentlemen
take
your
seats
and
get
your
questions
ready
leeds
disappeared
through
a
doorway
and
in
a
few
moments
returned
with
a
black
box
of
wood
covered
with
inscriptions
in
the
form
of
birds
beasts
and
human
heads
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
began
solemnly
once
having
had
occasion
to
visit
the
great
pyramid
of
khufu
a
pharaoh
of
the
fourth
dynasty
i
chanced
upon
a
sarcophagus
of
red
granite
in
a
forgotten
chamber
my
joy
was
great
for
i
thought
that
i
had
found
a
royal
mummy
but
what
was
my
disappointment
on
opening
the
coffin
at
the
cost
of
infinite
labor
to
find
nothing
more
than
this
box
which
you
may
examine
he
handed
the
box
to
those
in
the
front
row
padre
camorra
drew
back
in
loathing
padre
salvi
looked
at
it
closely
as
if
he
enjoyed
sepulchral
things
padre
irene
smiled
a
knowing
smile
don
custodio
affected
gravity
and
disdain
while
hunted
for
his
mirrors
there
they
must
be
for
it
was
a
question
of
mirrors
it
smells
like
a
corpse
observed
one
lady
fanning
herself
furiously
ugh
it
smells
of
forty
centuries
remarked
some
one
with
emphasis
forgot
about
his
mirrors
to
discover
who
had
made
this
remark
it
was
a
military
official
who
had
read
the
history
of
napoleon
felt
jealous
and
to
utter
another
epigram
that
might
annoy
padre
camorra
a
little
said
it
smells
of
the
church
this
box
ladies
and
gentlemen
continued
the
american
contained
a
handful
of
ashes
and
a
piece
of
papyrus
on
which
were
written
some
words
examine
them
yourselves
but
i
beg
of
you
not
to
breathe
heavily
because
if
any
of
the
dust
is
lost
my
sphinx
will
appear
in
a
mutilated
condition
the
humbug
described
with
such
seriousness
and
conviction
was
gradually
having
its
effect
so
much
so
that
when
the
box
was
passed
around
no
one
dared
to
breathe
padre
camorra
who
had
so
often
depicted
from
the
pulpit
of
tiani
the
torments
and
sufferings
of
hell
while
he
laughed
in
his
sleeves
at
the
terrified
looks
of
the
sinners
held
his
nose
and
padre
salvi
the
same
padre
salvi
who
had
on
all
souls
day
prepared
a
phantasmagoria
of
the
souls
in
purgatory
with
flames
and
transparencies
illuminated
with
alcohol
lamps
and
covered
with
tinsel
on
the
high
altar
of
the
church
in
a
suburb
in
order
to
get
alms
and
orders
for
masses
the
lean
and
taciturn
padre
salvi
held
his
breath
and
gazed
suspiciously
at
that
handful
of
ashes
homo
quia
pulvis
muttered
padre
irene
with
a
smile
pish
sneered
the
same
thought
had
occurred
to
him
and
the
canon
had
taken
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
not
knowing
what
to
do
resumed
leeds
closing
the
box
carefully
i
examined
the
papyrus
and
discovered
two
words
whose
meaning
was
unknown
to
me
i
deciphered
them
and
tried
to
pronounce
them
aloud
scarcely
had
i
uttered
the
first
word
when
i
felt
the
box
slipping
from
my
hands
as
if
pressed
down
by
an
enormous
weight
and
it
glided
along
the
floor
whence
i
vainly
endeavored
to
remove
it
but
my
surprise
was
converted
into
terror
when
it
opened
and
i
found
within
a
human
head
that
stared
at
me
fixedly
paralyzed
with
fright
and
uncertain
what
to
do
in
the
presence
of
such
a
phenomenon
i
remained
for
a
time
stupefied
trembling
like
a
person
poisoned
with
mercury
but
after
a
while
recovered
myself
and
thinking
that
it
was
a
vain
illusion
tried
to
divert
my
attention
by
reading
the
second
word
hardly
had
i
pronounced
it
when
the
box
closed
the
head
disappeared
and
in
its
place
i
again
found
the
handful
of
ashes
without
suspecting
it
i
had
discovered
the
two
most
potent
words
in
nature
the
words
of
creation
and
destruction
of
life
and
of
death
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
to
note
the
effect
of
his
story
then
with
grave
and
measured
steps
approached
the
table
and
placed
the
mysterious
box
upon
it
the
cloth
mister
exclaimed
the
incorrigible
why
not
rejoined
leeds
very
complaisantly
lifting
the
box
with
his
right
hand
he
caught
up
the
cloth
with
his
left
completely
exposing
the
table
sustained
by
its
three
legs
again
he
placed
the
box
upon
the
center
and
with
great
gravity
turned
to
his
audience
here
what
i
want
to
see
said
to
his
neighbor
you
notice
how
he
makes
some
excuse
great
attention
was
depicted
on
all
countenances
and
silence
reigned
the
noise
and
roar
of
the
street
could
be
distinctly
heard
but
all
were
so
affected
that
a
snatch
of
dialogue
which
reached
them
produced
no
effect
why
ca
we
go
in
asked
a
woman
voice
there
a
lot
of
friars
and
clerks
in
there
answered
a
man
the
sphinx
is
for
them
only
the
friars
are
inquisitive
too
said
the
woman
voice
drawing
away
they
do
want
us
to
know
how
they
being
fooled
why
is
the
head
a
friar
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
silence
the
american
announced
in
a
tone
of
emotion
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
a
word
i
am
now
going
to
reanimate
the
handful
of
ashes
and
you
will
talk
with
a
being
that
knows
the
past
the
present
and
much
of
the
future
here
the
prestidigitator
uttered
a
soft
cry
first
mournful
then
lively
a
medley
of
sharp
sounds
like
imprecations
and
hoarse
notes
like
threats
which
made
hair
stand
on
end
cried
the
american
the
curtains
on
the
wall
rustled
the
lamps
burned
low
the
table
creaked
a
feeble
groan
responded
from
the
interior
of
the
box
pale
and
uneasy
all
stared
at
one
another
while
one
terrified
señora
caught
hold
of
padre
salvi
the
box
then
opened
of
its
own
accord
and
presented
to
the
eyes
of
the
audience
a
head
of
cadaverous
aspect
surrounded
by
long
and
abundant
black
hair
it
slowly
opened
its
eyes
and
looked
around
the
whole
audience
those
eyes
had
a
vivid
radiance
accentuated
by
their
cavernous
sockets
and
as
if
deep
were
calling
unto
deep
fixed
themselves
upon
the
profound
sunken
eyes
of
the
trembling
padre
salvi
who
was
staring
unnaturally
as
though
he
saw
a
ghost
sphinx
commanded
leeds
tell
the
audience
who
you
are
a
deep
silence
prevailed
while
a
chill
wind
blew
through
the
room
and
made
the
blue
flames
of
the
sepulchral
lamps
flicker
the
most
skeptical
shivered
i
am
imuthis
declared
the
head
in
a
funereal
but
strangely
menacing
voice
i
was
born
in
the
time
of
amasis
and
died
under
the
persian
domination
when
cambyses
was
returning
from
his
disastrous
expedition
into
the
interior
of
libya
i
had
come
to
complete
my
education
after
extensive
travels
through
greece
assyria
and
persia
and
had
returned
to
my
native
laud
to
dwell
in
it
until
thoth
should
call
me
before
his
terrible
tribunal
but
to
my
undoing
on
passing
through
babylonia
i
discovered
an
awful
secret
the
secret
of
the
false
smerdis
who
usurped
the
throne
the
bold
magian
gaumata
who
governed
as
an
impostor
fearing
that
i
would
betray
him
to
cambyses
he
determined
upon
my
ruin
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
egyptian
priests
who
at
that
time
ruled
my
native
country
they
were
the
owners
of
of
the
land
the
monopolizers
of
learning
they
held
the
people
down
in
ignorance
and
tyranny
they
brutalized
them
thus
making
them
fit
to
pass
without
resistance
from
one
domination
to
another
the
invaders
availed
themselves
of
them
and
knowing
their
usefulness
protected
and
enriched
them
the
rulers
not
only
depended
on
their
will
but
some
were
reduced
to
mere
instruments
of
theirs
the
egyptian
priests
hastened
to
execute
gaumata
orders
with
greater
zeal
from
their
fear
of
me
because
they
were
afraid
that
i
would
reveal
their
impostures
to
the
people
to
accomplish
their
purpose
they
made
use
of
a
young
priest
of
abydos
who
passed
for
a
saint
a
painful
silence
followed
these
words
that
head
was
talking
of
priestly
intrigues
and
impostures
and
although
referring
to
another
age
and
other
creeds
all
the
friars
present
were
annoyed
possibly
because
they
could
see
in
the
general
trend
of
the
speech
some
analogy
to
the
existing
situation
padre
salvi
was
in
the
grip
of
convulsive
shivering
he
worked
his
lips
and
with
bulging
eyes
followed
the
gaze
of
the
head
as
though
fascinated
beads
of
sweat
began
to
break
out
on
his
emaciated
face
but
no
one
noticed
this
so
deeply
absorbed
and
affected
were
they
what
was
the
plot
concocted
by
the
priests
of
your
country
against
you
asked
leeds
the
head
uttered
a
sorrowful
groan
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
bottom
of
the
heart
and
the
spectators
saw
its
eyes
those
fiery
eyes
clouded
and
filled
with
tears
many
shuddered
and
felt
their
hair
rise
no
that
was
not
an
illusion
it
was
not
a
trick
the
head
was
the
victim
and
what
it
told
was
its
own
story
ay
it
moaned
shaking
with
affliction
i
loved
a
maiden
the
daughter
of
a
priest
pure
as
light
like
the
freshly
opened
lotus
the
young
priest
of
abydos
also
desired
her
and
planned
a
rebellion
using
my
name
and
some
papyri
that
he
had
secured
from
my
beloved
the
rebellion
broke
out
at
the
time
when
cambyses
was
returning
in
rage
over
the
disasters
of
his
unfortunate
campaign
i
was
accused
of
being
a
rebel
was
made
a
prisoner
and
having
effected
my
escape
was
killed
in
the
chase
on
lake
moeris
from
out
of
eternity
i
saw
the
imposture
triumph
i
saw
the
priest
of
abydos
night
and
day
persecuting
the
maiden
who
had
taken
refuge
in
a
temple
of
isis
on
the
island
of
philae
i
saw
him
persecute
and
harass
her
even
in
the
subterranean
chambers
i
saw
him
drive
her
mad
with
terror
and
suffering
like
a
huge
bat
pursuing
a
white
dove
ah
priest
priest
of
abydos
i
have
returned
to
life
to
expose
your
infamy
and
after
so
many
years
of
silence
i
name
thee
murderer
hypocrite
liar
a
dry
hollow
laugh
accompanied
these
words
while
a
choked
voice
responded
no
mercy
it
was
padre
salvi
who
had
been
overcome
with
terror
and
with
arms
extended
was
slipping
in
collapse
to
the
floor
what
the
matter
with
your
reverence
are
you
ill
asked
padre
irene
the
heat
of
the
room
this
odor
of
corpses
we
breathing
here
murderer
slanderer
hypocrite
repeated
the
head
i
accuse
you
murderer
murderer
murderer
again
the
dry
laugh
sepulchral
and
menacing
resounded
as
though
that
head
were
so
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
its
wrongs
that
it
did
not
see
the
tumult
that
prevailed
in
the
room
mercy
she
still
lives
groaned
padre
salvi
and
then
lost
consciousness
he
was
as
pallid
as
a
corpse
some
of
the
ladies
thought
it
their
duty
to
faint
also
and
proceeded
to
do
so
he
is
out
of
his
head
padre
salvi
i
told
him
not
to
eat
that
soup
said
padre
irene
it
has
made
him
sick
but
he
did
eat
anything
rejoined
don
custodio
shivering
as
the
head
has
been
staring
at
him
fixedly
it
has
mesmerized
him
so
disorder
prevailed
the
room
seemed
to
be
a
hospital
or
a
battlefield
padre
salvi
looked
like
a
corpse
and
the
ladies
seeing
that
no
one
was
paying
them
any
attention
made
the
best
of
it
by
recovering
meanwhile
the
head
had
been
reduced
to
ashes
and
leeds
having
replaced
the
cloth
on
the
table
bowed
his
audience
out
this
show
must
be
prohibited
said
don
custodio
on
leaving
wicked
and
highly
immoral
and
above
all
because
it
does
use
mirrors
added
who
before
going
out
of
the
room
tried
to
assure
himself
finally
so
he
leaped
over
the
rail
went
up
to
the
table
and
raised
the
cloth
nothing
absolutely
nothing
on
the
following
day
he
wrote
an
article
in
which
he
spoke
of
occult
sciences
spiritualism
and
the
like
an
order
came
immediately
from
the
ecclesiastical
governor
prohibiting
the
show
but
leeds
had
already
disappeared
carrying
his
secret
with
him

placido
penitente
left
the
class
with
his
heart
overflowing
with
bitterness
and
sullen
gloom
in
his
looks
he
was
worthy
of
his
name
when
not
driven
from
his
usual
course
but
once
irritated
he
was
a
veritable
torrent
a
wild
beast
that
could
only
be
stopped
by
the
death
of
himself
or
his
foe
so
many
affronts
so
many
pinpricks
day
after
day
had
made
his
heart
quiver
lodging
in
it
to
sleep
the
sleep
of
lethargic
vipers
and
they
now
were
awaking
to
shake
and
hiss
with
fury
the
hisses
resounded
in
his
ears
with
the
jesting
epithets
of
the
professor
the
phrases
in
the
slang
of
the
markets
and
he
seemed
to
hear
blows
and
laughter
a
thousand
schemes
for
revenge
rushed
into
his
brain
crowding
one
another
only
to
fade
immediately
like
phantoms
in
a
dream
his
vanity
cried
out
to
him
with
desperate
tenacity
that
he
must
do
something
placido
penitente
said
the
voice
show
these
youths
that
you
have
dignity
that
you
are
the
son
of
a
valiant
and
noble
province
where
wrongs
are
washed
out
with
blood
you
a
batangan
placido
penitente
avenge
yourself
placido
penitente
the
youth
groaned
and
gnashed
his
teeth
stumbling
against
every
one
in
the
street
and
on
the
bridge
of
spain
as
if
he
were
seeking
a
quarrel
in
the
latter
place
he
saw
a
carriage
in
which
was
the
padre
sibyla
accompanied
by
don
custodio
and
he
had
a
great
mind
to
seize
the
friar
and
throw
him
into
the
river
he
proceeded
along
the
escolta
and
was
tempted
to
assault
two
augustinians
who
were
seated
in
the
doorway
of
quiroga
bazaar
laughing
and
joking
with
other
friars
who
must
have
been
inside
in
joyous
conversation
for
their
merry
voices
and
sonorous
laughter
could
be
heard
somewhat
farther
on
two
cadets
blocked
up
the
sidewalk
talking
with
the
clerk
of
a
warehouse
who
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
penitents
moved
toward
them
to
force
a
passage
and
they
perceiving
his
dark
intention
made
way
for
him
placido
was
by
this
time
under
the
influence
of
the
as
the
malayists
say
as
he
approached
his
home
the
house
of
a
silversmith
where
he
lived
as
a
boarder
he
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
make
a
plan
to
return
to
his
town
and
avenge
himself
by
showing
the
friars
that
they
could
not
with
impunity
insult
a
youth
or
make
a
joke
of
him
he
decided
to
write
a
letter
immediately
to
his
mother
cabesang
andang
to
inform
her
of
what
had
happened
and
to
tell
her
that
the
schoolroom
had
closed
forever
for
him
although
there
was
the
ateneo
of
the
jesuits
where
he
might
study
that
year
yet
it
was
not
very
likely
that
the
dominicans
would
grant
him
the
transfer
and
even
though
he
should
secure
it
in
the
following
year
he
would
have
to
return
to
the
university
they
say
that
we
do
know
how
to
avenge
ourselves
he
muttered
let
the
lightning
strike
and
we
see
but
placido
was
not
reckoning
upon
what
awaited
him
in
the
house
of
the
silversmith
cabesang
andang
had
just
arrived
from
batangas
having
come
to
do
some
shopping
to
visit
her
son
and
to
bring
him
money
jerked
venison
and
silk
handkerchiefs
the
first
greetings
over
the
poor
woman
who
had
at
once
noticed
her
son
gloomy
look
could
no
longer
restrain
her
curiosity
and
began
to
ask
questions
his
first
explanations
cabesang
andang
regarded
as
some
subterfuge
so
she
smiled
and
soothed
her
son
reminding
him
of
their
sacrifices
and
privations
she
spoke
of
capitana
simona
son
who
having
entered
the
seminary
now
carried
himself
in
the
town
like
a
bishop
and
capitana
simona
already
considered
herself
a
mother
of
god
clearly
so
for
her
son
was
going
to
be
another
christ
if
the
son
becomes
a
priest
said
she
the
mother
wo
have
to
pay
us
what
she
owes
us
who
will
collect
from
her
then
but
on
seeing
that
placido
was
speaking
seriously
and
reading
in
his
eyes
the
storm
that
raged
within
him
she
realized
that
what
he
was
telling
her
was
unfortunately
the
strict
truth
she
remained
silent
for
a
while
and
then
broke
out
into
lamentations
ay
she
exclaimed
i
promised
your
father
that
i
would
care
for
you
educate
you
and
make
a
lawyer
of
you
i
deprived
myself
of
everything
so
that
you
might
go
to
school
instead
of
joining
the
where
the
stake
is
a
half
peso
i
ve
gone
only
where
a
half
real
enduring
the
bad
smells
and
the
dirty
cards
look
at
my
patched
camisa
for
instead
of
buying
new
ones
i
spent
the
money
in
masses
and
presents
to
sebastian
even
though
i
do
have
great
confidence
in
his
power
because
the
curate
recites
the
masses
fast
and
hurriedly
he
an
entirely
new
saint
and
does
yet
know
how
to
perform
miracles
and
is
made
of
but
of
ay
what
will
your
father
say
to
me
when
i
die
and
see
him
again
so
the
poor
woman
lamented
and
wept
while
placido
became
gloomier
and
let
stifled
sighs
escape
from
his
breast
what
would
i
get
out
of
being
a
lawyer
was
his
response
what
will
become
of
you
asked
his
mother
clasping
her
hands
they
call
you
a
filibuster
and
garrote
you
i
told
you
that
you
must
have
patience
that
you
must
be
humble
i
do
tell
you
that
you
must
kiss
the
hands
of
the
curates
for
i
know
that
you
have
a
delicate
sense
of
smell
like
your
father
who
endure
european
cheese
but
we
have
to
suffer
to
be
silent
to
say
yes
to
everything
what
are
we
going
to
do
the
friars
own
everything
and
if
they
are
unwilling
no
one
will
become
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
have
patience
my
son
have
patience
but
i
had
a
great
deal
mother
i
suffered
for
months
and
months
cabesang
andang
then
resumed
her
lamentations
she
did
not
ask
that
he
declare
himself
a
partizan
of
the
friars
she
was
not
one
herself
it
was
enough
to
know
that
for
one
good
friar
there
were
ten
bad
who
took
the
money
from
the
poor
and
deported
the
rich
but
one
must
be
silent
suffer
and
endure
there
was
no
other
course
she
cited
this
man
and
that
one
who
by
being
and
humble
even
though
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
hated
his
masters
had
risen
from
servant
of
the
friars
to
high
office
and
such
another
who
was
rich
and
could
commit
abuses
secure
of
having
patrons
who
would
protect
him
from
the
law
yet
who
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
poor
sacristan
humble
and
obedient
and
who
had
married
a
pretty
girl
whose
son
had
the
curate
for
a
godfather
so
cabesang
andang
continued
her
litany
of
humble
and
filipinos
as
she
called
them
and
was
about
to
cite
others
who
by
not
being
so
had
found
themselves
persecuted
and
exiled
when
placido
on
some
trifling
pretext
left
the
house
to
wander
about
the
streets
he
passed
through
sibakong
tondo
san
nicolas
and
santo
cristo
absorbed
in
his
without
taking
note
of
the
sun
or
the
hour
and
only
when
he
began
to
feel
hungry
and
discovered
that
he
had
no
money
having
given
it
all
for
celebrations
and
contributions
did
he
return
to
the
house
he
had
expected
that
he
would
not
meet
his
mother
there
as
she
was
in
the
habit
when
in
manila
of
going
out
at
that
hour
to
a
neighboring
house
where
was
played
but
cabesang
andang
was
waiting
to
propose
her
plan
she
would
avail
herself
of
the
procurator
of
the
augustinians
to
restore
her
son
to
the
good
graces
of
the
dominicans
placido
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
i
throw
myself
into
the
sea
first
he
declared
i
become
a
tulisan
before
i
go
back
to
the
university
again
his
mother
began
her
preachment
about
patience
and
humility
so
he
went
away
again
without
having
eaten
anything
directing
his
steps
toward
the
quay
where
the
steamers
tied
up
the
sight
of
a
steamer
weighing
anchor
for
hongkong
inspired
him
with
an
idea
to
go
to
hongkong
to
run
away
get
rich
there
and
make
war
on
the
friars
the
thought
of
hongkong
awoke
in
his
mind
the
recollection
of
a
story
about
frontals
cirials
and
candelabra
of
pure
silver
which
the
piety
of
the
faithful
had
led
them
to
present
to
a
certain
church
the
friars
so
the
silversmith
told
had
sent
to
hongkong
to
have
duplicate
frontals
cirials
and
candelabra
made
of
german
silver
which
they
substituted
for
the
genuine
ones
these
being
melted
down
and
coined
into
mexican
pesos
such
was
the
story
he
had
heard
and
though
it
was
no
more
than
a
rumor
or
a
story
his
resentment
gave
it
the
color
of
truth
and
reminded
him
of
other
tricks
of
theirs
in
that
same
style
the
desire
to
live
free
and
certain
plans
led
him
to
decide
upon
hongkong
if
the
corporations
sent
all
their
money
there
commerce
must
be
flourishing
and
he
could
enrich
himself
i
want
to
be
free
to
live
free
night
surprised
him
wandering
along
san
fernando
but
not
meeting
any
sailor
he
knew
he
decided
to
return
home
as
the
night
was
beautiful
with
a
brilliant
moon
transforming
the
squalid
city
into
a
fantastic
fairy
kingdom
he
went
to
the
fair
there
he
wandered
back
and
forth
passing
booths
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
articles
in
them
ever
with
the
thought
of
hongkong
of
living
free
of
enriching
himself
he
was
about
to
leave
the
fair
when
he
thought
he
recognized
the
jeweler
simoun
bidding
to
a
foreigner
both
of
them
speaking
in
english
to
placido
every
language
spoken
in
the
philippines
by
europeans
when
not
spanish
had
to
be
english
and
besides
he
caught
the
name
hongkong
if
only
the
jeweler
would
recommend
him
to
that
foreigner
who
must
be
setting
out
for
hongkong
placido
paused
he
was
acquainted
with
the
jeweler
as
the
latter
had
been
in
his
town
peddling
his
wares
and
he
had
accompanied
him
on
one
of
his
trips
when
simoun
had
made
himself
very
amiable
indeed
telling
him
of
the
life
in
the
universities
of
the
free
countries
what
a
difference
so
he
followed
the
jeweler
señor
simoun
señor
simoun
he
called
the
jeweler
was
at
that
moment
entering
his
carriage
recognizing
placido
he
checked
himself
i
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
simoun
made
a
sign
of
impatience
which
placido
in
his
perturbation
did
not
observe
in
a
few
words
the
youth
related
what
had
happened
and
made
known
his
desire
to
go
to
hongkong
why
asked
simoun
staring
fixedly
at
placido
through
his
blue
goggles
placido
did
not
answer
so
simoun
threw
back
his
head
smiled
his
cold
silent
smile
and
said
all
right
come
with
me
to
calle
iris
he
directed
the
cochero
simoun
remained
silent
throughout
the
whole
drive
apparently
absorbed
in
meditation
of
a
very
important
nature
placido
kept
quiet
waiting
for
him
to
speak
first
and
entertained
himself
in
watching
the
promenaders
who
were
enjoying
the
clear
moonlight
pairs
of
infatuated
lovers
followed
by
watchful
mammas
or
aunts
groups
of
students
in
white
clothes
that
the
moonlight
made
whiter
still
soldiers
in
a
carriage
six
together
on
their
way
to
visit
some
nipa
temple
dedicated
to
cytherea
children
playing
their
games
and
chinese
selling
all
these
filled
the
streets
taking
on
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
fantastic
forms
and
ideal
outlines
in
one
house
an
orchestra
was
playing
waltzes
and
couples
might
be
seen
dancing
under
the
bright
lamps
and
chandeliers
what
a
sordid
spectacle
they
presented
in
comparison
with
the
sight
the
streets
afforded
thinking
of
hongkong
he
asked
himself
if
the
moonlit
nights
in
that
island
were
so
poetical
and
sweetly
melancholy
as
those
of
the
philippines
and
a
deep
sadness
settled
down
over
his
heart
simoun
ordered
the
carriage
to
stop
and
both
alighted
just
at
the
moment
when
isagani
and
paulita
gomez
passed
them
murmuring
sweet
inanities
behind
them
came
doña
victorina
with
juanito
pelaez
who
was
talking
in
a
loud
voice
busily
gesticulating
and
appearing
to
have
a
larger
hump
than
ever
in
his
preoccupation
pelaez
did
not
notice
his
former
schoolmate
there
a
fellow
who
happy
muttered
placido
with
a
sigh
as
he
gazed
toward
the
group
which
became
converted
into
vaporous
silhouettes
with
juanito
arms
plainly
visible
rising
and
falling
like
the
arms
of
a
windmill
that
all
he
good
for
observed
simoun
it
fine
to
be
young
to
whom
did
placido
and
simoun
each
allude
the
jeweler
made
a
sign
to
the
young
man
and
they
left
the
street
to
pick
their
way
through
a
labyrinth
of
paths
and
passageways
among
various
houses
at
times
leaping
upon
stones
to
avoid
the
mudholes
or
stepping
aside
from
the
sidewalks
that
were
badly
constructed
and
still
more
badly
tended
placido
was
surprised
to
see
the
rich
jeweler
move
through
such
places
as
if
he
were
familiar
with
them
they
at
length
reached
an
open
lot
where
a
wretched
hut
stood
off
by
itself
surrounded
by
and
some
bamboo
frames
and
sections
of
the
same
material
led
placido
to
suspect
that
they
were
approaching
the
house
of
a
pyrotechnist
simoun
rapped
on
the
window
and
a
man
face
appeared
ah
sir
he
exclaimed
and
immediately
came
outside
is
the
powder
here
asked
simoun
in
sacks
i
waiting
for
the
shells
and
the
bombs

all
ready

right
then
this
very
night

must
go
and
inform
the
lieutenant
and
the
corporal

on
your
way
and
in
lamayan

man

a
banka

he
will
answer

that

gave
him
some
gold
coins
how

good
spanish

the
unknown

backward

thought

postponed
until

his
head

said
with
cabesang
tales

a
regiment

maria
clara
may
be
dead
start
at
once
the
man
disappeared
placido
who
had
stood
by
and
heard
all
of
this
brief
interview
felt
his
hair
rise
and
stared
with
startled
eyes
at
simoun
who
smiled
you
surprised
he
said
with
his
icy
smile
that
this
indian
so
poorly
dressed
speaks
spanish
well
he
was
a
schoolmaster
who
persisted
in
teaching
spanish
to
the
children
and
did
not
stop
until
he
had
lost
his
position
and
had
been
deported
as
a
disturber
of
the
public
peace
and
for
having
been
a
friend
of
the
unfortunate
ibarra
i
got
him
back
from
his
deportation
where
he
had
been
working
as
a
pruner
of
and
have
made
him
a
pyrotechnist
they
returned
to
the
street
and
set
out
for
trozo
before
a
wooden
house
of
pleasant
and
appearance
was
a
spaniard
on
crutches
enjoying
the
moonlight
when
simoun
accosted
him
his
attempt
to
rise
was
accompanied
by
a
stifled
groan
you
ready
simoun
inquired
of
him
i
always
am
the
coming
week
so
soon
at
the
first
he
moved
away
followed
by
placido
who
was
beginning
to
ask
himself
if
he
were
not
dreaming
does
it
surprise
you
simoun
asked
him
to
see
a
spaniard
so
young
and
so
afflicted
with
disease
two
years
ago
he
was
as
robust
as
you
are
but
his
enemies
succeeded
in
sending
him
to
balabak
to
work
in
a
penal
settlement
and
there
he
caught
the
rheumatism
and
fever
that
are
dragging
him
into
the
grave
the
poor
devil
had
married
a
very
beautiful
woman
as
an
empty
carriage
was
passing
simoun
hailed
it
and
with
placido
directed
it
to
his
house
in
the
escolta
just
at
the
moment
when
the
clocks
were
striking
ten
two
hours
later
placido
left
the
jeweler
house
and
walked
gravely
and
thoughtfully
along
the
escolta
then
almost
deserted
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
cafés
were
still
quite
animated
now
and
then
a
carriage
passed
rapidly
clattering
noisily
over
the
worn
pavement
from
a
room
in
his
house
that
overlooked
the
pasig
simoun
turned
his
gaze
toward
the
walled
city
which
could
be
seen
through
the
open
windows
with
its
roofs
of
galvanized
iron
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
and
its
somber
towers
showing
dull
and
gloomy
in
the
midst
of
the
serene
night
he
laid
aside
his
blue
goggles
and
his
white
hair
like
a
frame
of
silver
surrounded
his
energetic
bronzed
features
dimly
lighted
by
a
lamp
whose
flame
was
dying
out
from
lack
of
oil
apparently
wrapped
in
thought
he
took
no
notice
of
the
fading
light
and
impending
darkness
within
a
few
days
he
murmured
when
on
all
sides
that
accursed
city
is
burning
den
of
presumptuous
nothingness
and
impious
exploitation
of
the
ignorant
and
the
distressed
when
the
tumults
break
out
in
the
suburbs
and
there
rush
into
the
terrorized
streets
my
avenging
hordes
engendered
by
rapacity
and
wrongs
then
will
i
burst
the
walls
of
your
prison
i
will
tear
you
from
the
clutches
of
fanaticism
and
my
white
dove
you
will
be
the
phoenix
that
will
rise
from
the
glowing
embers
a
revolution
plotted
by
men
in
darkness
tore
me
from
your
side
another
revolution
will
sweep
me
into
your
arms
and
revive
me
that
moon
before
reaching
the
apogee
of
its
brilliance
will
light
the
philippines
cleansed
of
loathsome
filth
simoun
stopped
suddenly
as
though
interrupted
a
voice
in
his
inner
consciousness
was
asking
if
he
simoun
were
not
also
a
part
of
the
filth
of
that
accursed
city
perhaps
its
most
poisonous
ferment
like
the
dead
who
are
to
rise
at
the
sound
of
the
last
trumpet
a
thousand
bloody
specters
desperate
shades
of
murdered
men
women
violated
fathers
torn
from
their
families
vices
stimulated
and
encouraged
virtues
mocked
now
rose
in
answer
to
the
mysterious
question
for
the
first
time
in
his
criminal
career
since
in
havana
he
had
by
means
of
corruption
and
bribery
set
out
to
fashion
an
instrument
for
the
execution
of
his
plans
a
man
without
faith
patriotism
or
conscience
for
the
first
time
in
that
life
something
within
rose
up
and
protested
against
his
actions
he
closed
his
eyes
and
remained
for
some
time
motionless
then
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
tried
to
be
deaf
to
his
conscience
and
felt
fear
creeping
over
him
no
he
must
not
analyze
himself
he
lacked
the
courage
to
turn
his
gaze
toward
his
past
the
idea
of
his
courage
his
conviction
his
failing
him
at
the
very
moment
when
his
work
was
set
before
him
as
the
ghosts
of
the
wretches
in
whose
misfortunes
he
had
taken
a
hand
continued
to
hover
before
his
eyes
as
if
issuing
from
the
shining
surface
of
the
river
to
invade
the
room
with
appeals
and
hands
extended
toward
him
as
reproaches
and
laments
seemed
to
fill
the
air
with
threats
and
cries
for
vengeance
he
turned
his
gaze
from
the
window
and
for
the
first
time
began
to
tremble
no
i
must
be
ill
i
ca
be
feeling
well
he
muttered
there
are
many
who
hate
me
who
ascribe
their
misfortunes
to
me
but
he
felt
his
forehead
begin
to
burn
so
he
arose
to
approach
the
window
and
inhale
the
fresh
night
breeze
below
him
the
pasig
dragged
along
its
silvered
stream
on
whose
bright
surface
the
foam
glittered
winding
slowly
about
receding
and
advancing
following
the
course
of
the
little
eddies
the
city
loomed
up
on
the
opposite
bank
and
its
black
walls
looked
fateful
mysterious
losing
their
sordidness
in
the
moonlight
that
idealizes
and
embellishes
everything
but
again
simoun
shivered
he
seemed
to
see
before
him
the
severe
countenance
of
his
father
dying
in
prison
but
dying
for
having
done
good
then
the
face
of
another
man
severer
still
who
had
given
his
life
for
him
because
he
believed
that
he
was
going
to
bring
about
the
regeneration
of
his
country
no
i
ca
turn
back
he
exclaimed
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
the
work
is
at
hand
and
its
success
will
justify
me
if
i
had
conducted
myself
as
you
did
i
should
have
succumbed
nothing
of
idealism
nothing
of
fallacious
theories
fire
and
steel
to
the
cancer
chastisement
to
vice
and
afterwards
destroy
the
instrument
if
it
be
bad
no
i
have
planned
well
but
now
i
feel
feverish
my
reason
wavers
it
is
natural
if
i
have
done
ill
it
has
been
that
i
may
do
good
and
the
end
justifies
the
means
what
i
will
do
is
not
to
expose
myself
with
his
thoughts
thus
confused
he
lay
down
and
tried
to
fall
asleep
on
the
following
morning
placido
listened
submissively
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
to
his
mother
preachment
when
she
spoke
of
her
plan
of
interesting
the
augustinian
procurator
he
did
not
protest
or
object
but
on
the
contrary
offered
himself
to
carry
it
out
in
order
to
save
trouble
for
his
mother
whom
he
begged
to
return
at
once
to
the
province
that
very
day
if
possible
cabesang
andang
asked
him
the
reason
for
such
haste
because
because
if
the
procurator
learns
that
you
are
here
he
do
anything
until
you
send
him
a
present
and
order

the
arbiter
true
it
was
that
padre
irene
had
said
the
question
of
the
academy
of
castilian
so
long
before
broached
was
on
the
road
to
a
solution
don
custodio
the
active
don
custodio
the
most
active
of
all
the
arbiters
in
the
world
according
to
was
occupied
with
it
spending
his
days
reading
the
petition
and
falling
asleep
without
reaching
any
decision
waking
on
the
following
day
to
repeat
the
same
performance
dropping
off
to
sleep
again
and
so
on
continuously
how
the
good
man
labored
the
most
active
of
all
the
arbiters
in
the
world
he
wished
to
get
out
of
the
predicament
by
pleasing
everybody
the
friars
the
high
official
the
countess
padre
irene
and
his
own
liberal
principles
he
had
consulted
with
señor
pasta
and
señor
pasta
had
left
him
stupefied
and
confused
after
advising
him
to
do
a
million
contradictory
and
impossible
things
he
had
consulted
with
pepay
the
dancing
girl
and
pepay
who
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
executed
a
pirouette
and
asked
him
for
pesos
to
bury
an
aunt
of
hers
who
had
suddenly
died
for
the
fifth
time
or
the
fifth
aunt
who
had
suddenly
died
according
to
fuller
explanations
at
the
same
time
requesting
that
he
get
a
cousin
of
hers
who
could
read
write
and
play
the
violin
a
job
as
assistant
on
the
public
works
all
things
that
were
far
from
inspiring
don
custodio
with
any
saving
idea
two
days
after
the
events
in
the
quiapo
fair
don
custodio
was
as
usual
busily
studying
the
petition
without
hitting
upon
the
happy
solution
while
he
yawns
coughs
smokes
and
thinks
about
legs
and
her
pirouettes
let
us
give
some
account
of
this
exalted
personage
in
order
to
understand
padre
sibyla
reason
for
proposing
him
as
the
arbiter
of
such
a
vexatious
matter
and
why
the
other
clique
accepted
him
don
custodio
de
salazar
y
sanchez
de
monteredondo
often
referred
to
as
belonged
to
that
class
of
manila
society
which
can
not
take
a
step
without
having
the
newspapers
heap
titles
upon
them
calling
each
distinguished
zealous
active
profound
intelligent
and
so
on
as
if
they
feared
that
he
might
be
confused
with
some
idle
and
ignorant
possessor
of
the
same
name
besides
no
harm
resulted
from
it
and
the
watchful
censor
was
not
disturbed
the
resulted
from
his
friendship
with
when
the
latter
in
his
two
noisiest
controversies
which
he
carried
on
for
weeks
and
months
in
the
columns
of
the
newspapers
about
whether
it
was
proper
to
wear
a
high
hat
a
derby
or
a
and
whether
the
plural
of
should
be
or
in
order
to
strengthen
his
argument
always
came
out
with
we
have
this
on
good
authority
we
learn
this
from
good
authority
later
letting
it
be
known
for
in
manila
everything
becomes
known
that
this
was
no
other
than
don
custodio
de
salazar
y
sanchez
de
monteredondo
he
had
come
to
manila
very
young
with
a
good
position
that
had
enabled
him
to
marry
a
pretty
mestiza
belonging
to
one
of
the
wealthiest
families
of
the
city
as
he
had
natural
talent
boldness
and
great
and
knew
how
to
make
use
of
the
society
in
which
he
found
himself
he
launched
into
business
with
his
wife
money
filling
contracts
for
the
government
by
reason
of
which
he
was
made
alderman
afterwards
alcalde
member
of
the
economic
society
councilor
of
the
administration
president
of
the
directory
of
the
member
of
the
society
of
mercy
director
of
the
bank
etc
nor
are
these
to
be
taken
like
those
ordinarily
placed
after
a
long
enumeration
of
titles
don
custodio
although
never
having
seen
a
treatise
on
hygiene
came
to
be
of
the
board
of
health
for
the
truth
was
that
of
the
eight
who
composed
this
board
only
one
had
to
be
a
physician
and
he
could
not
be
that
one
so
also
he
was
a
member
of
the
vaccination
board
which
was
composed
of
three
physicians
and
seven
laymen
among
these
being
the
archbishop
and
three
provincials
he
was
a
brother
in
all
the
confraternities
of
the
common
and
of
the
most
exalted
dignity
and
as
we
have
seen
director
of
the
superior
commission
of
primary
instruction
which
usually
did
not
do
anything
all
these
being
quite
sufficient
reason
for
the
newspapers
to
heap
adjectives
upon
him
no
less
when
he
traveled
than
when
he
sneezed
in
spite
of
so
many
offices
don
custodio
was
not
among
those
who
slept
through
the
sessions
contenting
themselves
like
lazy
and
timid
delegates
in
voting
with
the
majority
the
opposite
of
the
numerous
kings
of
europe
who
bear
the
title
of
king
of
jerusalem
don
custodio
made
his
dignity
felt
and
got
from
it
all
the
benefit
possible
often
frowning
making
his
voice
impressive
coughing
out
his
words
often
taking
up
the
whole
session
telling
a
story
presenting
a
project
or
disputing
with
a
colleague
who
had
placed
himself
in
open
opposition
to
him
although
not
past
forty
he
already
talked
of
acting
with
circumspection
of
letting
the
figs
ripen
adding
under
his
breath
pumpkins
of
pondering
deeply
and
of
stepping
with
careful
tread
of
the
necessity
for
understanding
the
country
because
the
nature
of
the
indians
because
the
prestige
of
the
spanish
name
because
they
were
first
of
all
spaniards
because
religion
and
so
on
remembered
yet
in
manila
is
a
speech
of
his
when
for
the
first
time
it
was
proposed
to
light
the
city
with
kerosene
in
place
of
the
old
coconut
oil
in
such
an
innovation
far
from
seeing
the
extinction
of
the
industry
he
merely
discerned
the
interests
of
a
certain
alderman
because
don
custodio
saw
a
long
way
and
opposed
it
with
all
the
resonance
of
his
bucal
cavity
considering
the
project
too
premature
and
predicting
great
social
cataclysms
no
less
celebrated
was
his
opposition
to
a
sentimental
serenade
that
some
wished
to
tender
a
certain
governor
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
don
custodio
who
felt
a
little
resentment
over
some
slight
or
other
succeeded
in
insinuating
the
idea
that
the
rising
star
was
the
mortal
enemy
of
the
setting
one
whereat
the
frightened
promoters
of
the
serenade
gave
it
up
one
day
he
was
advised
to
return
to
spain
to
be
cured
of
a
liver
complaint
and
the
newspapers
spoke
of
him
as
an
antaeus
who
had
to
set
foot
in
the
mother
country
to
gain
new
strength
but
the
manila
antaeus
found
himself
a
small
and
insignificant
person
at
the
capital
there
he
was
nobody
and
he
missed
his
beloved
adjectives
he
did
not
mingle
with
the
upper
set
and
his
lack
of
education
prevented
him
from
amounting
to
much
in
the
academies
and
scientific
centers
while
his
backwardness
and
his
politics
drove
him
from
the
clubs
disgusted
vexed
seeing
nothing
clearly
but
that
there
they
were
forever
borrowing
money
and
gambling
heavily
he
missed
the
submissive
servants
of
manila
who
endured
all
his
peevishness
and
who
now
seemed
to
be
far
preferable
when
a
winter
kept
him
between
a
fireplace
and
an
attack
of
pneumonia
he
sighed
for
the
manila
winter
during
which
a
single
quilt
is
sufficient
while
in
summer
he
missed
the
and
the
boy
to
fan
him
in
short
in
madrid
he
was
only
one
among
many
and
in
spite
of
his
diamonds
he
was
once
taken
for
a
rustic
who
did
not
know
how
to
comport
himself
and
at
another
time
for
an
his
scruples
were
scoffed
at
and
he
was
shamelessly
flouted
by
some
borrowers
whom
he
offended
disgusted
with
the
conservatives
who
took
no
great
notice
of
his
advice
as
well
as
with
the
sponges
who
rifled
his
pockets
he
declared
himself
to
be
of
the
liberal
party
and
returned
within
a
year
to
the
philippines
if
not
sound
in
his
liver
yet
completely
changed
in
his
beliefs
the
eleven
months
spent
at
the
capital
among
café
politicians
nearly
all
retired
the
various
speeches
caught
here
and
there
this
or
that
article
of
the
opposition
all
the
political
life
that
permeates
the
air
from
the
where
amid
the
the
figaro
announces
his
program
to
the
banquets
where
in
harmonious
periods
and
telling
phrases
the
different
shades
of
political
opinion
the
divergences
and
disagreements
are
adjusted
all
these
things
awoke
in
him
the
farther
he
got
from
europe
like
the
sap
within
the
sown
seed
prevented
from
bursting
out
by
the
thick
husk
in
such
a
way
that
when
he
reached
manila
he
believed
that
he
was
going
to
regenerate
it
and
actually
had
the
holiest
plans
and
the
purest
ideals
during
the
first
months
after
his
return
he
was
continually
talking
about
the
capital
about
his
good
friends
about
minister
the
delegate
the
author
and
there
was
not
a
political
event
a
court
scandal
of
which
he
was
not
informed
to
the
last
detail
nor
was
there
a
public
man
the
secrets
of
whose
private
life
were
unknown
to
him
nor
could
anything
occur
that
he
had
not
foreseen
nor
any
reform
be
ordered
but
he
had
first
been
consulted
all
this
was
seasoned
with
attacks
on
the
conservatives
in
righteous
indignation
with
apologies
of
the
liberal
party
with
a
little
anecdote
here
a
phrase
there
from
some
great
man
dropped
in
as
one
who
did
not
wish
offices
and
employments
which
same
he
had
refused
in
order
not
to
be
beholden
to
the
conservatives
such
was
his
enthusiasm
in
these
first
days
that
various
cronies
in
the
which
he
visited
from
time
to
time
affiliated
themselves
with
the
liberal
party
and
began
to
style
themselves
liberals

inspector
and
don

tacon
and
but
nevertheless
from
lack
of
encouragement
and
of
opposition
his
enthusiasm
gradually
waned
he
did
not
read
the
newspapers
that
came
from
spain
because
they
arrived
in
packages
the
sight
of
which
made
him
yawn
the
ideas
that
he
had
caught
having
been
all
expended
he
needed
reinforcement
and
his
orators
were
not
there
and
although
in
the
casinos
of
manila
there
was
enough
gambling
and
money
was
borrowed
as
in
madrid
no
speech
that
would
nourish
his
political
ideas
was
permitted
in
them
but
don
custodio
was
not
lazy
he
did
more
than
wish
he
worked
foreseeing
that
he
was
going
to
leave
his
bones
in
the
philippines
he
began
to
consider
that
country
his
proper
sphere
and
to
devote
his
efforts
to
its
welfare
thinking
to
liberalize
it
he
commenced
to
draw
up
a
series
of
reforms
or
projects
which
were
ingenious
to
say
the
least
it
was
he
who
having
heard
in
madrid
mention
of
the
wooden
street
pavements
of
paris
not
yet
adopted
in
spain
proposed
the
introduction
of
them
in
manila
by
covering
the
streets
with
boards
nailed
down
as
they
are
on
the
sides
of
houses
it
was
he
who
deploring
the
accidents
to
vehicles
planned
to
avoid
them
by
putting
on
at
least
three
wheels
it
was
also
he
who
while
acting
as
of
the
board
of
health
ordered
everything
fumigated
even
the
telegrams
that
came
from
infected
places
it
was
also
he
who
in
compassion
for
the
convicts
that
worked
in
the
sun
and
with
a
desire
of
saving
to
the
government
the
cost
of
their
equipment
suggested
that
they
be
clothed
in
a
simple
and
set
to
work
not
by
day
but
at
night
he
marveled
he
stormed
that
his
projects
should
encounter
objectors
but
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
man
who
is
worth
enemies
has
them
and
revenged
himself
by
attacking
and
tearing
to
pieces
any
project
good
or
bad
presented
by
others
as
he
prided
himself
on
being
a
liberal
upon
being
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
indians
he
would
answer
like
one
conferring
a
great
favor
that
they
were
fitted
for
manual
labor
and
the
meaning
thereby
music
painting
and
sculpture
adding
his
old
postscript
that
to
know
them
one
must
have
resided
many
many
years
in
the
country
yet
when
he
heard
of
any
one
of
them
excelling
in
something
that
was
not
manual
labor
or
an
in
chemistry
medicine
or
philosophy
for
example
he
would
exclaim
ah
he
promises
fairly
fairly
well
he
not
a
fool
and
feel
sure
that
a
great
deal
of
spanish
blood
must
flow
in
the
veins
of
such
an
if
unable
to
discover
any
in
spite
of
his
good
intentions
he
then
sought
a
japanese
origin
for
it
was
at
that
time
the
fashion
began
of
attributing
to
the
japanese
or
the
arabs
whatever
good
the
filipinos
might
have
in
them
for
him
the
native
songs
were
arabic
music
as
was
also
the
alphabet
of
the
ancient
filipinos
he
was
certain
of
this
although
he
did
not
know
arabic
nor
had
he
ever
seen
that
alphabet
arabic
the
purest
arabic
he
said
to
in
a
tone
that
admitted
no
reply
at
best
chinese
then
he
would
add
with
a
significant
wink
nothing
can
be
nothing
ought
to
be
original
with
the
indians
you
understand
i
like
them
greatly
but
they
must
be
allowed
to
pride
themselves
upon
anything
for
then
they
would
take
heart
and
turn
into
a
lot
of
wretches
at
other
times
he
would
say
i
love
the
indians
fondly
constituted
myself
their
father
and
defender
but
it
necessary
to
keep
everything
in
its
proper
place
some
were
born
to
command
and
others
to
serve
plainly
that
is
a
truism
which
ca
be
uttered
very
loudly
but
it
can
be
put
into
practise
without
many
words
for
look
the
trick
depends
upon
trifles
when
you
wish
to
reduce
a
people
to
subjection
assure
it
that
it
is
in
subjection
the
first
day
it
will
laugh
the
second
protest
the
third
doubt
and
the
fourth
be
convinced
to
keep
the
filipino
docile
he
must
have
repeated
to
him
day
after
day
what
he
is
to
convince
him
that
he
is
incompetent
what
good
would
it
do
besides
to
have
him
believe
in
something
else
that
would
make
him
wretched
believe
me
it
an
act
of
charity
to
hold
every
creature
in
his
place
that
is
order
harmony
that
constitutes
the
of
government
in
referring
to
his
policies
don
custodio
was
not
satisfied
with
the
word
and
upon
pronouncing
the
word
he
would
extend
his
hand
downwards
to
the
height
of
a
man
bent
over
on
his
knees
in
regard
to
his
religious
ideas
he
prided
himself
on
being
a
catholic
very
much
a
catholic
ah
catholic
spain
the
land
of
a
liberal
could
be
and
ought
to
be
a
catholic
when
the
reactionaries
were
setting
themselves
up
as
gods
or
saints
just
as
a
mulatto
passes
for
a
white
man
in
kaffirland
but
with
all
that
he
ate
meat
during
lent
except
on
good
friday
never
went
to
confession
believed
neither
in
miracles
nor
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
and
when
he
attended
mass
went
to
the
one
at
ten
or
to
the
shortest
the
military
mass
although
in
madrid
he
had
spoken
ill
of
the
religious
orders
so
as
not
to
be
out
of
harmony
with
his
surroundings
considering
them
anachronisms
and
had
hurled
curses
against
the
inquisition
while
relating
this
or
that
lurid
or
droll
story
wherein
the
habits
danced
or
rather
friars
without
habits
yet
in
speaking
of
the
philippines
which
should
be
ruled
by
special
laws
he
would
cough
look
wise
and
again
extend
his
hand
downwards
to
that
mysterious
altitude
the
friars
are
necessary
they
a
necessary
evil
he
would
declare
but
how
he
would
rage
when
any
indian
dared
to
doubt
the
miracles
or
did
not
acknowledge
the
pope
all
the
tortures
of
the
inquisition
were
insufficient
to
punish
such
temerity
when
it
was
objected
that
to
rule
or
to
live
at
the
expense
of
ignorance
has
another
and
somewhat
ugly
name
and
is
punished
by
law
when
the
culprit
is
a
single
person
he
would
justify
his
position
by
referring
to
other
colonies
we
he
would
announce
in
his
official
tone
can
speak
out
plainly
we
not
like
the
british
and
the
dutch
who
in
order
to
hold
people
in
subjection
make
use
of
the
lash
we
avail
ourselves
of
other
means
milder
and
surer
the
salutary
influence
of
the
friars
is
superior
to
the
british
lash
this
last
remark
made
his
fortune
for
a
long
time
continued
to
use
adaptations
of
it
and
with
him
all
manila
the
thinking
part
of
manila
applauded
it
and
it
even
got
to
madrid
where
it
was
quoted
in
the
parliament
as
from
liberal
of
long
residence
the
friars
flattered
by
the
comparison
and
seeing
their
prestige
enhanced
sent
him
sacks
of
chocolate
presents
which
the
incorruptible
don
custodio
returned
so
that
immediately
compared
him
to
epaminondas
nevertheless
this
modern
epaminondas
made
use
of
the
rattan
in
his
choleric
moments
and
advised
its
use
at
that
time
the
conventos
fearful
that
he
would
render
a
decision
favorable
to
the
petition
of
the
students
increased
their
gifts
so
that
on
the
afternoon
when
we
see
him
he
was
more
perplexed
than
ever
his
reputation
for
energy
was
being
compromised
it
had
been
more
than
a
fortnight
since
he
had
had
the
petition
in
his
hands
and
only
that
morning
the
high
official
after
praising
his
zeal
had
asked
for
a
decision
don
custodio
had
replied
with
mysterious
gravity
giving
him
to
understand
that
it
was
not
yet
completed
the
high
official
had
smiled
a
smile
that
still
worried
and
haunted
him
as
we
were
saying
he
yawned
and
yawned
in
one
of
these
movements
at
the
moment
when
he
opened
his
eyes
and
closed
his
mouth
his
attention
was
caught
by
a
file
of
red
envelopes
arranged
in
regular
order
on
a
magnificent
kamagon
desk
on
the
back
of
each
could
be
read
in
large
letters
projects
for
a
moment
he
forgot
his
troubles
and
pepay
pirouettes
to
reflect
upon
all
that
those
files
contained
which
had
issued
from
his
prolific
brain
in
his
hours
of
inspiration
how
many
original
ideas
how
many
sublime
thoughts
how
many
means
of
ameliorating
the
woes
of
the
philippines
immortality
and
the
gratitude
of
the
country
were
surely
his
like
an
old
lover
who
discovers
a
moldy
package
of
amorous
epistles
don
custodio
arose
and
approached
the
desk
the
first
envelope
thick
swollen
and
plethoric
bore
the
title
projects
in
project
no
he
murmured
they
excellent
things
but
it
would
take
a
year
to
read
them
over
the
second
also
quite
voluminous
was
entitled
projects
under
consideration
no
not
those
either
then
came
the
projects
nearing
completion
projects
presented
projects
rejected
projects
approved
projects
postponed
these
last
envelopes
held
little
but
the
least
of
all
was
that
of
the
projects
executed
don
custodio
wrinkled
up
his
nose
what
did
it
contain
he
had
completely
forgotten
what
was
in
it
a
sheet
of
yellowish
paper
showed
from
under
the
flap
as
though
the
envelope
were
sticking
out
its
tongue
this
he
drew
out
and
unfolded
it
was
the
famous
project
for
the
school
of
arts
and
trades
what
the
devil
he
exclaimed
if
the
augustinian
padres
took
charge
of
it
suddenly
he
slapped
his
forehead
and
arched
his
eyebrows
while
a
look
of
triumph
overspread
his
face
i
have
reached
a
decision
he
cried
with
an
oath
that
was
not
exactly
my
decision
is
made
repeating
his
peculiar
five
or
six
times
which
struck
the
air
like
so
many
gleeful
lashes
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
radiant
with
joy
and
began
to
write
furiously
chapter
xxi
manila
types
that
night
there
was
a
grand
function
at
the
teatro
de
variedades
jouay
french
operetta
company
was
giving
its
initial
performance
cloches
de
to
the
eyes
of
the
public
was
to
be
exhibited
his
select
troupe
whose
fame
the
newspapers
had
for
days
been
proclaiming
it
was
reported
that
among
the
actresses
was
a
very
beautiful
voice
with
a
figure
even
more
beautiful
and
if
credit
could
be
given
to
rumor
her
amiability
surpassed
even
her
voice
and
figure
at
seven
in
the
evening
there
were
no
more
tickets
to
be
had
not
even
though
they
had
been
for
padre
salvi
himself
in
his
direct
need
and
the
persons
waiting
to
enter
the
general
admission
already
formed
a
long
queue
in
the
there
were
scuffles
and
fights
talk
of
filibusterism
and
races
but
this
did
not
produce
any
tickets
so
that
by
a
quarter
before
eight
fabulous
prices
were
being
offered
for
them
the
appearance
of
the
building
profusely
illuminated
with
flowers
and
plants
in
all
the
doors
and
windows
enchanted
the
new
arrivals
to
such
an
extent
that
they
burst
out
into
exclamations
and
applause
a
large
crowd
surged
about
the
entrance
gazing
enviously
at
those
going
in
those
who
came
early
from
fear
of
missing
their
seats
laughter
whispering
expectation
greeted
the
later
arrivals
who
disconsolately
joined
the
curious
crowd
and
now
that
they
could
not
get
in
contented
themselves
with
watching
those
who
did
yet
there
was
one
person
who
seemed
out
of
place
amid
such
great
eagerness
and
curiosity
he
was
a
tall
meager
man
who
dragged
one
leg
stiffly
when
he
walked
dressed
in
a
wretched
brown
coat
and
dirty
checkered
trousers
that
fitted
his
lean
bony
limbs
tightly
a
straw
sombrero
artistic
in
spite
of
being
broken
covered
an
enormous
head
and
allowed
his
dirty
gray
almost
red
hair
to
straggle
out
long
and
kinky
at
the
end
like
a
poet
curls
but
the
most
notable
thing
about
this
man
was
not
his
clothing
or
his
european
features
guiltless
of
beard
or
mustache
but
his
fiery
red
face
from
which
he
got
the
nickname
by
which
he
was
known
he
was
a
curious
character
belonging
to
a
prominent
spanish
family
but
he
lived
like
a
vagabond
and
a
beggar
scoffing
at
the
prestige
which
he
flouted
indifferently
with
his
rags
he
was
reputed
to
be
a
kind
of
reporter
and
in
fact
his
gray
so
cold
and
thoughtful
always
showed
up
where
anything
publishable
was
happening
his
manner
of
living
was
a
mystery
to
all
as
no
one
seemed
to
know
where
he
ate
and
slept
perhaps
he
had
an
empty
hogshead
somewhere
but
at
that
moment
camaroncocido
lacked
his
usual
hard
and
indifferent
expression
something
like
mirthful
pity
being
reflected
in
his
looks
a
funny
little
man
accosted
him
merrily
friend
exclaimed
the
latter
in
a
raucous
voice
as
hoarse
as
a
frog
while
he
displayed
several
mexican
pesos
which
camaroncocido
merely
glanced
at
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
did
they
matter
to
him
the
little
old
man
was
a
fitting
contrast
to
him
small
very
small
he
wore
on
his
head
a
high
hat
which
presented
the
appearance
of
a
huge
hairy
worm
and
lost
himself
in
an
enormous
frock
coat
too
wide
and
too
long
for
him
to
reappear
in
trousers
too
short
not
reaching
below
his
calves
his
body
seemed
to
be
the
grandfather
and
his
legs
the
grandchildren
while
as
for
his
shoes
he
appeared
to
be
floating
on
the
land
for
they
were
of
an
enormous
sailor
type
apparently
protesting
against
the
hairy
worm
worn
on
his
head
with
all
the
energy
of
a
convento
beside
a
world
exposition
if
camaroncocido
was
red
he
was
brown
while
the
former
although
of
spanish
extraction
had
not
a
single
hair
on
his
face
yet
he
an
indian
had
a
goatee
and
mustache
both
long
white
and
sparse
his
expression
was
lively
he
was
known
as
and
like
his
friend
lived
on
publicity
advertising
the
shows
and
posting
the
theatrical
announcements
being
perhaps
the
only
filipino
who
could
appear
with
impunity
in
a
silk
hat
and
frock
coat
just
as
his
friend
was
the
first
spaniard
who
laughed
at
the
prestige
of
his
race
the
frenchman
has
paid
me
well
he
said
smiling
and
showing
his
picturesque
gums
which
looked
like
a
street
after
a
conflagration
i
did
a
good
job
in
posting
the
bills
camaroncocido
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
quico
he
rejoined
in
a
cavernous
voice
if
they
given
you
six
pesos
for
your
work
how
much
will
they
give
the
friars
tio
quico
threw
back
his
head
in
his
usual
lively
manner
to
the
friars
because
you
surely
know
continued
camaroncocido
that
all
this
crowd
was
secured
for
them
by
the
conventos
the
fact
was
that
the
friars
headed
by
padre
salvi
and
some
lay
brethren
captained
by
don
custodio
had
opposed
such
shows
padre
camorra
who
could
not
attend
watered
at
the
eyes
and
mouth
but
argued
with
who
defended
them
feebly
thinking
of
the
free
tickets
they
would
send
his
newspaper
don
custodio
spoke
of
morality
religion
good
manners
and
the
like
but
stammered
the
writer
if
our
own
farces
with
their
plays
on
words
and
phrases
of
double
meaning
but
at
least
they
in
castilian
the
virtuous
councilor
interrupted
with
a
roar
inflamed
to
righteous
wrath
obscenities
in
french
man
for
god
sake
in
french
never
he
uttered
this
with
the
energy
of
three
guzmans
threatened
with
being
killed
like
fleas
if
they
did
not
surrender
twenty
tarifas
padre
irene
naturally
agreed
with
don
custodio
and
execrated
french
operetta
whew
he
had
been
in
paris
but
had
never
set
foot
in
a
theater
the
lord
deliver
him
yet
the
french
operetta
also
counted
numerous
partizans
the
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
among
them
the
general
aides
the
clerks
and
many
society
people
were
anxious
to
enjoy
the
delicacies
of
the
french
language
from
the
mouths
of
genuine
and
with
them
were
affiliated
those
who
had
traveled
by
the
and
had
jabbered
a
little
french
during
the
voyage
those
who
had
visited
paris
and
all
those
who
wished
to
appear
learned
hence
manila
society
was
divided
into
two
factions
operettists
and
the
latter
were
supported
by
the
elderly
ladies
wives
jealous
and
careful
of
their
husbands
love
and
by
those
who
were
engaged
while
those
who
were
free
and
those
who
were
beautiful
declared
themselves
enthusiastic
operettists
notes
and
then
more
notes
were
exchanged
there
were
goings
and
comings
mutual
recriminations
meetings
lobbyings
arguments
even
talk
of
an
insurrection
of
the
natives
of
their
indolence
of
inferior
and
superior
races
of
prestige
and
other
humbugs
so
that
after
much
gossip
and
more
recrimination
the
permit
was
granted
padre
salvi
at
the
same
time
publishing
a
pastoral
that
was
read
by
no
one
but
the
there
were
questionings
whether
the
general
had
quarreled
with
the
countess
whether
she
spent
her
time
in
the
halls
of
pleasure
whether
his
excellency
was
greatly
annoyed
whether
there
had
been
presents
exchanged
whether
the
french
consul
and
so
on
and
on
many
names
were
bandied
about
quiroga
the
chinaman
simoun
and
even
those
of
many
actresses
thanks
to
these
scandalous
preliminaries
the
people
impatience
had
been
aroused
and
since
the
evening
before
when
the
troupe
arrived
there
was
talk
of
nothing
but
attending
the
first
performance
from
the
hour
when
the
red
posters
announced
cloches
de
the
victors
prepared
to
celebrate
their
triumph
in
some
offices
instead
of
the
time
being
spent
in
reading
newspapers
and
gossiping
it
was
devoted
to
devouring
the
synopsis
and
spelling
out
french
novels
while
many
feigned
business
outside
to
consult
their
on
the
sly
so
no
business
was
transacted
callers
were
told
to
come
back
the
next
day
but
the
public
could
not
take
offense
for
they
encountered
some
very
polite
and
affable
clerks
who
received
and
dismissed
them
with
grand
salutations
in
the
french
style
the
clerks
were
practising
brushing
the
dust
off
their
french
and
calling
to
one
another
monsieur
vous
and
at
every
turn
so
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
and
hear
them
but
the
place
where
the
excitement
reached
its
climax
was
the
newspaper
office
having
been
appointed
critic
and
translator
of
the
synopsis
trembled
like
a
poor
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
as
he
saw
his
enemies
picking
out
his
blunders
and
throwing
up
to
his
face
his
deficient
knowledge
of
french
when
the
italian
opera
was
on
he
had
very
nearly
received
a
challenge
for
having
mistranslated
a
name
while
an
envious
rival
had
immediately
published
an
article
referring
to
him
as
an
ignoramus
him
the
foremost
thinking
head
in
the
philippines
all
the
trouble
he
had
had
to
defend
himself
he
had
had
to
write
at
least
seventeen
articles
and
consult
fifteen
dictionaries
so
with
these
salutary
recollections
the
wretched
moved
about
with
leaden
hands
to
say
nothing
of
his
feet
for
that
would
be
plagiarizing
padre
camorra
who
had
once
intimated
that
the
journalist
wrote
with
them
you
see
quico
said
camaroncocido
one
half
of
the
people
have
come
because
the
friars
told
them
not
to
making
it
a
kind
of
public
protest
and
the
other
half
because
they
say
to
themselves
the
friars
object
to
it
then
it
must
be
instructive
believe
me
quico
your
advertisements
are
a
good
thing
but
the
pastoral
was
better
even
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
it
was
read
by
no
one
friend
do
you
believe
asked
tio
quico
uneasily
that
on
account
of
the
competition
with
padre
salvi
my
business
will
in
the
future
be
prohibited
maybe
so
quico
maybe
so
replied
the
other
gazing
at
the
sky
money
getting
scarce
tio
quico
muttered
some
incoherent
words
if
the
friars
were
going
to
turn
theatrical
advertisers
he
would
become
a
friar
after
bidding
his
friend
he
moved
away
coughing
and
rattling
his
silver
coins
with
his
eternal
indifference
camaroncocido
continued
to
wander
about
here
and
there
with
his
crippled
leg
and
sleepy
looks
the
arrival
of
unfamiliar
faces
caught
his
attention
coming
as
they
did
from
different
parts
and
signaling
to
one
another
with
a
wink
or
a
cough
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
seen
these
individuals
on
such
an
occasion
he
who
knew
all
the
faces
and
features
in
the
city
men
with
dark
faces
humped
shoulders
uneasy
and
uncertain
movements
poorly
disguised
as
though
they
had
for
the
first
time
put
on
sack
coats
slipped
about
among
the
shadows
shunning
attention
instead
of
getting
in
the
front
rows
where
they
could
see
well
detectives
or
thieves
camaroncocido
asked
himself
and
immediately
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
what
is
it
to
me
the
lamp
of
a
carriage
that
drove
up
lighted
in
passing
a
group
of
four
or
five
of
these
individuals
talking
with
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
an
army
officer
detectives
it
must
be
a
new
corps
he
muttered
with
his
shrug
of
indifference
soon
however
he
noticed
that
the
officer
after
speaking
to
two
or
three
more
groups
approached
a
carriage
and
seemed
to
be
talking
vigorously
with
some
person
inside
camaroncocido
took
a
few
steps
forward
and
without
surprise
thought
that
he
recognized
the
jeweler
simoun
while
his
sharp
ears
caught
this
short
dialogue
the
signal
will
be
a
gunshot
yes
sir
do
worry
it
the
general
who
is
ordering
it
but
be
careful
about
saying
so
if
you
follow
my
instructions
you
get
a
promotion
yes
sir
so
be
ready
the
voice
ceased
and
a
second
later
the
carriage
drove
away
in
spite
of
his
indifference
camaroncocido
could
not
but
mutter
afoot
hands
on
pockets
but
feeling
his
own
to
be
empty
he
again
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
did
it
matter
to
him
even
though
the
heavens
should
fall
so
he
continued
his
pacing
about
on
passing
near
two
persons
engaged
in
conversation
he
caught
what
one
of
them
who
had
rosaries
and
scapularies
around
his
neck
was
saying
in
tagalog
the
friars
are
more
powerful
than
the
general
do
be
a
fool
he
go
away
and
they
stay
here
so
if
we
do
well
we
get
rich
the
signal
is
a
gunshot
hold
hard
hold
hard
murmured
camaroncocido
tightening
his
fingers
on
that
side
the
general
on
this
padre
salvi
poor
country
but
what
is
it
to
me
again
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
expectorating
at
the
same
time
two
actions
that
with
him
were
indications
of
supreme
indifference
he
continued
his
observations
meanwhile
the
carriages
were
arriving
in
dizzy
streams
stopping
directly
before
the
door
to
set
down
the
members
of
the
select
society
although
the
weather
was
scarcely
even
cool
the
ladies
sported
magnificent
shawls
silk
neckerchiefs
and
even
light
cloaks
among
the
escorts
some
who
were
in
frock
coats
with
white
ties
wore
overcoats
while
others
carried
them
on
their
arms
to
display
the
rich
silk
linings
in
a
group
of
spectators
tadeo
he
who
was
always
taken
ill
the
moment
the
professor
appeared
was
accompanied
by
a
fellow
townsman
of
his
the
novice
whom
we
saw
suffer
evil
consequences
from
reading
wrongly
the
cartesian
principle
this
novice
was
very
inquisitive
and
addicted
to
tiresome
questions
and
tadeo
was
taking
advantage
of
his
ingenuousness
and
inexperience
to
relate
to
him
the
most
stupendous
lies
every
spaniard
that
spoke
to
him
whether
clerkling
or
underling
was
presented
as
a
leading
merchant
a
marquis
or
a
count
while
on
the
other
hand
any
one
who
passed
him
by
was
a
greenhorn
a
petty
official
a
nobody
when
pedestrians
failed
him
in
keeping
up
the
novice
astonishment
he
resorted
to
the
resplendent
carriages
that
came
up
tadeo
would
bow
politely
wave
his
hand
in
a
friendly
manner
and
call
out
a
familiar
greeting
who
he
bah
was
the
negligent
reply
the
civil
governor
the
judge
señora
all
friends
of
mine
the
novice
marveled
and
listened
in
fascination
taking
care
to
keep
on
the
left
tadeo
the
friend
of
judges
and
governors
tadeo
named
all
the
persons
who
arrived
when
he
did
not
know
them
inventing
titles
biographies
and
interesting
sketches
you
see
that
tall
gentleman
with
dark
whiskers
somewhat
dressed
in
black
he
judge
a
an
intimate
friend
of
the
wife
of
colonel
b
one
day
if
it
had
been
for
me
they
would
have
come
to
blows
hello
here
comes
that
colonel
what
if
they
should
fight
the
novice
held
his
breath
but
the
colonel
and
the
judge
shook
hands
cordially
the
soldier
an
old
bachelor
inquiring
about
the
health
of
the
judge
family
ah
thank
heaven
breathed
tadeo
i
the
one
who
made
them
friends
what
if
they
should
invite
us
to
go
in
asked
the
novice
timidly
get
out
boy
i
never
accept
favors
retorted
tadeo
majestically
i
confer
them
but
disinterestedly
the
novice
bit
his
lip
and
felt
smaller
than
ever
while
he
placed
a
respectful
distance
between
himself
and
his
fellow
townsman
tadeo
resumed
that
is
the
musician
h
that
one

delivered
as
his

a
speech
printed
in
all

professes
completely

his
chosen
disciple
that
man
in
a
light
suit
with
his
hat
tilted
back

the
government
clerk
whose
maxim
is
never

who
rages
like
a
demon

one
day
i
got
him
out
of
a
bad
fix

was
on
a
friday

morning

because
i
breakfasted

by
a
duenna

the
celebrated
pepay
the
dancing
girl
but
she

catholic

forbidden

and
a
great
friend
of

but
has
one
defect
he
a
chinese
mestizo
and
yet
calls
himself
a
peninsular
spaniard
sssh
look
at
him
with
the
face
of
a
friar
who
carrying
a
pencil
and
a
roll
of
paper
in
his
hand
the
great
writer
a
good
friend
of
mine
he
has
talent
you
do
say
and
that
little
man
with
white
whiskers
he
the
official
who
has
appointed
his
daughters
those
three
little
girls
assistants
in
his
department
so
as
to
get
their
names
on

a
clever

very
clever
when
he
makes
a
mistake
he
blames
it
on
somebody
else
he
buys
things
and
pays
for
them
out
of
the
treasury
he
clever
very
very
clever
tadeo
was
about
to
say
more
but
suddenly
checked
himself
and
that
gentleman
who
has
a
fierce
air
and
gazes
at
everybody
over
his
shoulders
inquired
the
novice
pointing
to
a
man
who
nodded
haughtily
but
tadeo
did
not
answer
he
was
craning
his
neck
to
see
paulita
gomez
who
was
approaching
with
a
friend
doña
victorina
and
juanito
pelaez
the
latter
had
presented
her
with
a
box
and
was
more
humped
than
ever
carriage
after
carriage
drove
up
the
actors
and
actresses
arrived
and
entered
by
a
separate
door
followed
by
their
friends
and
admirers
after
paulita
had
gone
in
tadeo
resumed
those
are
the
nieces
of
the
rich
captain
d
those
coming
up
in
a
landau
you
see
how
pretty
and
healthy
they
are
well
in
a
few
years
they
be
dead
or
crazy
captain
d
is
opposed
to
their
marrying
and
the
insanity
of
the
uncle
is
appearing
in
the
nieces
that
the
señorita
e
the
rich
heiress
whom
the
world
and
the
conventos
are
disputing
over
hello
i
know
that
fellow
it
padre
irene
in
disguise
with
a
false
mustache
i
recognize
him
by
his
nose
and
he
was
so
greatly
opposed
to
this
the
scandalized
novice
watched
a
neatly
cut
coat
disappear
behind
a
group
of
ladies
the
three
fates
went
on
tadeo
watching
the
arrival
of
three
withered
bony
and
shabbily
dressed
women
they
called
atropos
ventured
the
novice
who
wished
to
show
that
he
also
knew
somebody
at
least
in
mythology
no
boy
they
called
the
weary
waiters
old
censorious
and
dull
they
pretend
to
hate
everybody
men
women
and
children
but
look
how
the
lord
always
places
beside
the
evil
a
remedy
only
that
sometimes
it
comes
late
there
behind
the
fates
the
frights
of
the
city
come
those
three
girls
the
pride
of
their
friends
among
whom
i
count
myself
that
thin
young
man
with
somewhat
stooped
who
is
wildly
gesticulating
because
he
ca
get
tickets
is
the
chemist
s
author
of
many
essays
and
scientific
treatises
some
of
which
are
notable
and
have
captured
prizes
the
spaniards
say
of
him
some
hope
for
him
some
hope
for
him
the
fellow
who
is
soothing
him
with
his
voltairian
smile
is
the
poet
t
a
young
man
of
talent
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
for
the
very
reason
that
he
has
talent
he
has
thrown
away
his
pen
that
fellow
who
is
trying
to
get
in
with
the
actors
by
the
other
door
is
the
young
physician
u
who
has
effected
some
remarkable
cures
it
also
said
of
him
that
he
promises
well
he
not
such
a
scoundrel
as
pelaez
but
he
cleverer
and
slyer
still
i
believe
that
he
shake
dice
with
death
and
win
and
that
brown
gentleman
with
a
mustache
like
ah
that
the
merchant
f
who
forges
everything
even
his
baptismal
certificate
he
wants
to
be
a
spanish
mestizo
at
any
cost
and
is
making
heroic
efforts
to
forget
his
native
language
but
his
daughters
are
very
white
yes
that
the
reason
rice
has
gone
up
in
price
and
yet
they
eat
nothing
but
bread
the
novice
did
not
understand
the
connection
between
the
price
of
rice
and
the
whiteness
of
those
girls
but
he
held
his
peace
there
goes
the
fellow
that
engaged
to
one
of
them
that
thin
brown
youth
who
is
following
them
with
a
lingering
movement
and
speaking
with
a
protecting
air
to
the
three
friends
who
are
laughing
at
him
a
martyr
to
his
beliefs
to
his
consistency
the
novice
was
filled
with
admiration
and
respect
for
the
young
man
he
has
the
look
of
a
fool
and
he
is
one
continued
tadeo
he
was
born
in
san
pedro
makati
and
has
inflicted
many
privations
upon
himself
he
scarcely
ever
bathes
or
eats
pork
because
according
to
him
the
spaniards
do
do
those
things
and
for
the
same
reason
he
does
eat
rice
and
dried
fish
although
he
may
be
watering
at
the
mouth
and
dying
of
hunger
anything
that
comes
from
europe
rotten
or
preserved
he
considers
divine
a
month
ago
basilio
cured
him
of
a
severe
attack
of
gastritis
for
he
had
eaten
a
jar
of
mustard
to
prove
that
he
a
european
at
that
moment
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
waltz
you
see
that
gentleman
that
hypochondriac
who
goes
along
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
seeking
salutes
that
the
celebrated
governor
of
pangasinan
a
good
man
who
loses
his
appetite
whenever
any
indian
fails
to
salute
him
he
would
have
died
if
he
had
issued
the
proclamation
about
salutes
to
which
he
owes
his
celebrity
poor
fellow
it
only
been
three
days
since
he
came
from
the
province
and
look
how
thin
he
has
become
oh
here
the
great
man
the
illustrious
open
your
eyes
who
that
man
with
knitted
brows
yes
that
don
custodio
the
liberal
don
custodio
his
brows
are
knit
because
he
meditating
over
some
important
project
if
the
ideas
he
has
in
his
head
were
carried
out
this
would
be
a
different
world
ah
here
comes
makaraig
your
housemate
it
was
in
fact
makaraig
with
pecson
sandoval
and
isagani
upon
seeing
them
tadeo
advanced
and
spoke
to
them
are
you
coming
in
makaraig
asked
him
we
have
been
able
to
get
tickets
fortunately
we
have
a
box
replied
makaraig
basilio
come
both
of
you
come
in
with
us
tadeo
did
not
wait
for
the
invitation
to
be
repeated
but
the
novice
fearing
that
he
would
intrude
with
the
timidity
natural
to
the
provincial
indian
excused
himself
nor
could
he
be
persuaded
to
enter
chapter
xxii
the
performance
the
interior
of
the
theater
presented
a
lively
aspect
it
was
filled
from
top
to
bottom
with
people
standing
in
the
corridors
and
in
the
aisles
fighting
to
withdraw
a
head
from
some
hole
where
they
had
inserted
it
or
to
shove
an
eye
between
a
collar
and
an
ear
the
open
boxes
occupied
for
the
most
part
by
ladies
looked
like
baskets
of
flowers
whose
petals
the
fans
shook
in
a
light
breeze
wherein
hummed
a
thousand
bees
however
just
as
there
are
flowers
of
strong
or
delicate
fragrance
flowers
that
kill
and
flowers
that
console
so
from
our
baskets
were
exhaled
like
emanations
there
were
to
be
heard
dialogues
conversations
remarks
that
bit
and
stung
three
or
four
boxes
however
were
still
vacant
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
performance
had
been
advertised
for
eight
and
it
was
already
a
quarter
to
nine
but
the
curtain
did
not
go
up
as
his
excellency
had
not
yet
arrived
the
impatient
and
uncomfortable
in
their
seats
started
a
racket
clapping
their
hands
and
pounding
the
floor
with
their
canes
boom
boom
boom
ring
up
the
curtain
boom
boom
boom
the
artillerymen
were
not
the
least
noisy
emulators
of
mars
as
called
them
they
were
not
satisfied
with
this
music
thinking
themselves
perhaps
at
a
bullfight
they
made
remarks
at
the
ladies
who
passed
before
them
in
words
that
are
euphemistically
called
flowers
in
madrid
although
at
times
they
seem
more
like
foul
weeds
without
heeding
the
furious
looks
of
the
husbands
they
bandied
from
one
to
another
the
sentiments
and
longings
inspired
by
so
many
beauties
in
the
reserved
seats
where
the
ladies
seemed
to
be
afraid
to
venture
as
few
were
to
be
seen
there
a
murmur
of
voices
prevailed
amid
suppressed
laughter
and
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
they
discussed
the
merits
of
the
players
and
talked
scandal
wondering
if
his
excellency
had
quarreled
with
the
friars
if
his
presence
at
such
a
show
was
a
defiance
or
mere
curiosity
others
gave
no
heed
to
these
matters
but
were
engaged
in
attracting
the
attention
of
the
ladies
throwing
themselves
into
attitudes
more
or
less
interesting
and
statuesque
flashing
diamond
rings
especially
when
they
thought
themselves
the
foci
of
insistent
while
yet
another
would
address
a
respectful
salute
to
this
or
that
señora
or
señorita
at
the
same
time
lowering
his
head
gravely
to
whisper
to
a
neighbor
how
ridiculous
she
is
and
such
a
bore
the
lady
would
respond
with
one
of
her
most
gracious
smiles
and
an
enchanting
nod
of
her
head
while
murmuring
to
a
friend
sitting
near
amid
lazy
flourishes
of
her
fan
how
impudent
he
is
he
madly
in
love
my
dear
meanwhile
the
noise
increased
there
remained
only
two
vacant
boxes
besides
that
of
his
excellency
which
was
distinguished
by
its
curtains
of
red
velvet
the
orchestra
played
another
waltz
the
audience
protested
when
fortunately
there
arose
a
charitable
hero
to
distract
their
attention
and
relieve
the
manager
in
the
person
of
a
man
who
had
occupied
a
reserved
seat
and
refused
to
give
it
up
to
its
owner
the
philosopher
don
primitivo
finding
his
own
arguments
useless
don
primitivo
had
appealed
to
an
usher
i
do
care
to
the
hero
responded
to
the
latter
protests
placidly
puffing
at
his
cigarette
the
usher
appealed
to
the
manager
i
do
care
to
was
the
response
as
he
settled
back
in
the
seat
the
manager
went
away
while
the
artillerymen
in
the
gallery
began
to
sing
out
encouragement
to
the
usurper
our
hero
now
that
he
had
attracted
general
attention
thought
that
to
yield
would
be
to
lower
himself
so
he
held
on
to
the
seat
while
he
repeated
his
answer
to
a
pair
of
guards
the
manager
had
called
in
these
in
consideration
of
the
rebel
rank
went
in
search
of
their
corporal
while
the
whole
house
broke
out
into
applause
at
the
firmness
of
the
hero
who
remained
seated
like
a
roman
senator
hisses
were
heard
and
the
inflexible
gentleman
turned
angrily
to
see
if
they
were
meant
for
him
but
the
galloping
of
horses
resounded
and
the
stir
increased
one
might
have
said
that
a
revolution
had
broken
out
or
at
least
a
riot
but
no
the
orchestra
had
suspended
the
waltz
and
was
playing
the
royal
march
it
was
his
excellency
the
and
governor
of
the
islands
who
was
entering
all
eyes
sought
and
followed
him
then
lost
sight
of
him
until
he
finally
appeared
in
his
box
after
looking
all
about
him
and
making
some
persons
happy
with
a
lordly
salute
he
sat
down
as
though
he
were
indeed
the
man
for
whom
the
chair
was
waiting
the
artillerymen
then
became
silent
and
the
orchestra
tore
into
the
prelude
our
students
occupied
a
box
directly
facing
that
of
pepay
the
dancing
girl
her
box
was
a
present
from
makaraig
who
had
already
got
on
good
terms
with
her
in
order
to
propitiate
don
custodio
pepay
had
that
very
afternoon
written
a
note
to
the
illustrious
arbiter
asking
for
an
answer
and
appointing
an
interview
in
the
theater
for
this
reason
don
custodio
in
spite
of
the
active
opposition
he
had
manifested
toward
the
french
operetta
had
gone
to
the
theater
which
action
won
him
some
caustic
remarks
on
the
part
of
don
manuel
his
ancient
adversary
in
the
sessions
of
the
ayuntamiento
i
come
to
judge
the
operetta
he
had
replied
in
the
tone
of
a
cato
whose
conscience
was
clear
so
makaraig
was
exchanging
looks
of
intelligence
with
pepay
who
was
giving
him
to
understand
that
she
had
something
to
tell
him
as
the
dancing
girl
face
wore
a
happy
expression
the
students
augured
that
a
favorable
outcome
was
assured
sandoval
who
had
just
returned
from
making
calls
in
other
boxes
also
assured
them
that
the
decision
had
been
favorable
that
that
very
afternoon
the
superior
commission
had
considered
and
approved
it
every
one
was
jubilant
even
pecson
having
laid
aside
his
pessimism
when
he
saw
the
smiling
pepay
display
a
note
sandoval
and
makaraig
congratulated
one
another
isagani
alone
remaining
cold
and
unsmiling
what
had
happened
to
this
young
man
upon
entering
the
theater
isagani
had
caught
sight
of
paulita
in
a
box
with
juanito
pelaez
talking
to
her
he
had
turned
pale
thinking
that
he
must
be
mistaken
but
no
it
was
she
herself
she
who
greeted
him
with
a
gracious
smile
while
her
beautiful
eyes
seemed
to
be
asking
pardon
and
promising
explanations
the
fact
was
that
they
had
agreed
upon
isagani
going
first
to
the
theater
to
see
if
the
show
contained
anything
improper
for
a
young
woman
but
now
he
found
her
there
and
in
no
other
company
than
that
of
his
rival
what
passed
in
his
mind
is
indescribable
wrath
jealousy
humiliation
resentment
raged
within
him
and
there
were
moments
even
when
he
wished
that
the
theater
would
fall
in
he
had
a
violent
desire
to
laugh
aloud
to
insult
his
sweetheart
to
challenge
his
rival
to
make
a
scene
but
finally
contented
himself
with
sitting
quiet
and
not
looking
at
her
at
all
he
was
conscious
of
the
beautiful
plans
makaraig
and
sandoval
were
making
but
they
sounded
like
distant
echoes
while
the
notes
of
the
waltz
seemed
sad
and
lugubrious
the
whole
audience
stupid
and
foolish
and
several
times
he
had
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
back
the
tears
of
the
trouble
stirred
up
by
the
hero
who
refused
to
give
up
the
seat
of
the
arrival
of
the
he
was
scarcely
conscious
he
stared
toward
the
on
which
was
depicted
a
kind
of
gallery
with
sumptuous
red
hangings
affording
a
view
of
a
garden
in
which
a
fountain
played
yet
how
sad
the
gallery
looked
to
him
and
how
melancholy
the
painted
landscape
a
thousand
vague
recollections
surged
into
his
memory
like
distant
echoes
of
music
heard
in
the
night
like
songs
of
infancy
the
murmur
of
lonely
forests
and
gloomy
rivulets
moonlit
nights
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
spread
wide
before
his
eyes
so
the
enamored
youth
considered
himself
very
wretched
and
stared
fixedly
at
the
ceiling
so
that
the
tears
should
not
fall
from
his
eyes
a
burst
of
applause
drew
him
from
these
meditations
the
curtain
had
just
risen
and
the
merry
chorus
of
peasants
of
corneville
was
presented
all
dressed
in
cotton
caps
with
heavy
wooden
sabots
on
their
feet
some
six
or
seven
girls
on
the
lips
and
cheeks
with
large
black
circles
around
their
eyes
to
increase
their
brilliance
displayed
white
arms
fingers
covered
with
diamonds
round
and
shapely
limbs
while
they
were
chanting
the
norman
phrase
marchez
allez
marchez
they
smiled
at
their
different
admirers
in
the
reserved
seats
with
such
openness
that
don
custodio
after
looking
toward
pepay
box
to
assure
himself
that
she
was
not
doing
the
same
thing
with
some
other
admirer
set
down
in
his
this
indecency
and
to
make
sure
of
it
lowered
his
head
a
little
to
see
if
the
actresses
were
not
showing
their
knees
oh
these
frenchwomen
he
muttered
while
his
imagination
lost
itself
in
considerations
somewhat
more
elevated
as
he
made
comparisons
and
projects
tous
les
cancans
sang
gertrude
a
proud
damsel
who
was
looking
roguishly
askance
at
the
we
going
to
have
the
cancan
exclaimed
tadeo
the
winner
of
the
first
prize
in
the
french
class
who
had
managed
to
make
out
this
word
makaraig
they
going
to
dance
the
cancan
he
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
from
the
moment
the
curtain
rose
tadeo
had
been
heedless
of
the
music
he
was
looking
only
for
the
prurient
the
indecent
the
immoral
in
actions
and
dress
and
with
his
scanty
french
was
sharpening
his
ears
to
catch
the
obscenities
that
the
austere
guardians
of
the
fatherland
had
foretold
sandoval
pretending
to
know
french
had
converted
himself
into
a
kind
of
interpreter
for
his
friends
he
knew
as
much
about
it
as
tadeo
but
the
published
synopsis
helped
him
and
his
fancy
supplied
the
rest
yes
he
said
they
going
to
dance
the
cancan
going
to
lead
it
makaraig
and
pecson
redoubled
their
attention
smiling
in
anticipation
while
isagani
looked
away
mortified
to
think
that
paulita
should
be
present
at
such
a
show
and
reflecting
that
it
was
his
duty
to
challenge
juanito
pelaez
the
next
day
but
the
young
men
waited
in
vain
serpolette
came
on
a
charming
girl
in
her
cotton
cap
provoking
and
challenging
qui
parle
de
serpolette
she
demanded
of
the
gossips
with
her
arms
akimbo
in
a
combative
attitude
some
one
applauded
and
after
him
all
those
in
the
reserved
seats
without
changing
her
girlish
attitude
serpolette
gazed
at
the
person
who
had
started
the
applause
and
paid
him
with
a
smile
displaying
rows
of
little
teeth
that
looked
like
a
string
of
pearls
in
a
case
of
red
velvet
tadeo
followed
her
gaze
and
saw
a
man
in
a
false
mustache
with
an
extraordinarily
large
nose
by
the
monk
cowl
he
exclaimed
irene
yes
corroborated
sandoval
i
saw
him
behind
the
scenes
talking
with
the
actresses
the
truth
was
that
padre
irene
who
was
a
melomaniac
of
the
first
degree
and
knew
french
well
had
been
sent
to
the
theater
by
padre
salvi
as
a
sort
of
religious
detective
or
so
at
least
he
told
the
persons
who
recognized
him
as
a
faithful
critic
who
should
not
be
satisfied
with
viewing
the
piece
from
a
distance
he
wished
to
examine
the
actresses
at
first
hand
so
he
had
mingled
in
the
groups
of
admirers
and
gallants
had
penetrated
into
the
greenroom
where
was
whispered
and
talked
a
french
required
by
the
situation
a
a
language
that
is
readily
comprehensible
for
the
vender
when
the
buyer
seems
disposed
to
pay
well
serpolette
was
surrounded
by
two
gallant
officers
a
sailor
and
a
lawyer
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
moving
about
sticking
the
tip
of
his
long
nose
into
all
the
nooks
and
corners
as
though
with
it
he
were
ferreting
out
all
the
mysteries
of
the
stage
she
ceased
her
chatter
knitted
her
eyebrows
then
raised
them
opened
her
lips
and
with
the
vivacity
of
a
left
her
admirers
to
hurl
herself
like
a
torpedo
upon
our
critic
tiens
toutou
mon
lapin
she
cried
catching
padre
arm
and
shaking
it
merrily
while
the
air
rang
with
her
silvery
laugh
tut
tut
objected
padre
irene
endeavoring
to
conceal
himself
comment
toi
ici
grosse
bête
et
moi
qui
pas
lily
il
faut

with
great
difficulty
padre
irene
made
her
listen
to
reason
for
lily
was
to
meet
in
manila
an
old
friend
who
reminded
her
of
the
of
the
grand
opera
house
so
it
was
that
padre
irene
fulfilling
at
the
same
time
his
duties
as
a
friend
and
a
critic
had
initiated
the
applause
to
encourage
her
for
serpolette
deserved
it
meanwhile
the
young
men
were
waiting
for
the
cancan
pecson
became
all
eyes
but
there
was
everything
except
cancan
there
was
presented
the
scene
in
which
but
for
the
timely
arrival
of
the
representatives
of
the
law
the
women
would
have
come
to
blows
and
torn
one
hair
out
incited
thereto
by
the
mischievous
peasants
who
like
our
students
hoped
to
see
something
more
than
the
cancan

the
music
ceased
the
men
went
away
the
women
returned
a
few
at
a
time
and
started
a
conversation
among
themselves
of
which
our
friends
understood
nothing
they
were
slandering
some
absent
person
they
look
like
the
chinamen
of
the
whispered
pecson
but
the
cancan
asked
makaraig
they
talking
about
the
most
suitable
place
to
dance
it
gravely
responded
sandoval
they
look
like
the
chinamen
of
the
repeated
pecson
in
disgust
a
lady
accompanied
by
her
husband
entered
at
that
moment
and
took
her
place
in
one
of
the
two
vacant
boxes
she
had
the
air
of
a
queen
and
gazed
disdainfully
at
the
whole
house
as
if
to
say
i
come
later
than
all
of
you
you
crowd
of
upstarts
and
provincials
i
come
later
than
you
there
are
persons
who
go
to
the
theater
like
the
contestants
in
a
the
last
one
in
wins
and
we
know
very
sensible
men
who
would
ascend
the
scaffold
rather
than
enter
a
theater
before
the
first
act
but
the
lady
triumph
was
of
short
duration
she
caught
sight
of
the
other
box
that
was
still
empty
and
began
to
scold
her
better
half
thus
starting
such
a
disturbance
that
many
were
annoyed
ssh
ssh
the
blockheads
as
if
they
understood
french
remarked
the
lady
gazing
with
supreme
disdain
in
all
directions
finally
fixing
her
attention
on
juanito
box
whence
she
thought
she
had
heard
an
impudent
hiss
juanito
was
in
fact
guilty
for
he
had
been
pretending
to
understand
everything
holding
himself
up
proudly
and
applauding
at
times
as
though
nothing
that
was
said
escaped
him
and
this
too
without
guiding
himself
by
the
actors
pantomime
because
he
scarcely
looked
toward
the
stage
the
rogue
had
intentionally
remarked
to
paulita
that
as
there
was
so
much
more
beautiful
a
woman
close
at
hand
he
did
not
care
to
strain
his
eyes
looking
beyond
her
paulita
had
blushed
covered
her
face
with
her
fan
and
glanced
stealthily
toward
where
isagani
silent
and
morose
was
abstractedly
watching
the
show
paulita
felt
nettled
and
jealous
would
isagani
fall
in
love
with
any
of
those
alluring
actresses
the
thought
put
her
in
a
bad
humor
so
she
scarcely
heard
the
praises
that
doña
victorina
was
heaping
upon
her
own
favorite
juanito
was
playing
his
part
well
he
shook
his
head
at
times
in
sign
of
disapproval
and
then
there
could
be
heard
coughs
and
murmurs
in
some
parts
at
other
times
he
smiled
in
approbation
and
a
second
later
applause
resounded
doña
victorina
was
charmed
even
conceiving
some
vague
ideas
of
marrying
the
young
man
the
day
don
tiburcio
should
die
juanito
knew
french
and
de
espadaña
did
then
she
began
to
flatter
him
nor
did
he
perceive
the
change
in
the
drift
of
her
talk
so
occupied
was
he
in
watching
a
catalan
merchant
who
was
sitting
next
to
the
swiss
consul
having
observed
that
they
were
conversing
in
french
juanito
was
getting
his
inspiration
from
their
countenances
and
thus
grandly
giving
the
cue
to
those
about
him
scene
followed
scene
character
succeeded
character
comic
and
ridiculous
like
the
bailiff
and
grenicheux
imposing
and
winsome
like
the
marquis
and
germaine
the
audience
laughed
heartily
at
the
slap
delivered
by
gaspard
and
intended
for
the
coward
grenicheux
which
was
received
by
the
grave
bailiff
whose
wig
went
flying
through
the
air
producing
disorder
and
confusion
as
the
curtain
dropped
where
the
cancan
inquired
tadeo
but
the
curtain
rose
again
immediately
revealing
a
scene
in
a
servant
market
with
three
posts
on
which
were
affixed
signs
bearing
the
announcements
and
juanito
to
improve
the
opportunity
turned
to
doña
victorina
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
so
that
paulita
might
hear
and
he
convinced
of
his
learning
means
servants
domestics
and
in
what
way
do
the
differ
from
the
asked
paulita
juanito
was
not
found
wanting
are
those
that
are
domesticated
have
you
noticed
that
some
of
them
have
the
air
of
savages
those
are
the
that
right
added
doña
victorina
some
have
very
bad
manners
and
yet
i
thought
that
in
europe
everybody
was
cultivated
but
as
it
happens
in
france
well
i
see
ssh
ssh
but
what
was
juanito
predicament
when
the
time
came
for
the
opening
of
the
market
and
the
beginning
of
the
sale
and
the
servants
who
were
to
be
hired
placed
themselves
beside
the
signs
that
indicated
their
class
the
men
some
ten
or
twelve
rough
characters
in
livery
carrying
branches
in
their
hands
took
their
place
under
the
sign
those
are
the
domestics
explained
juanito
really
they
have
the
appearance
of
being
only
recently
domesticated
observed
doña
victorina
now
let
have
a
look
at
the
savages
then
the
dozen
girls
headed
by
the
lively
and
merry
serpolette
decked
out
in
their
best
clothes
each
wearing
a
big
bouquet
of
flowers
at
the
waist
laughing
smiling
fresh
and
attractive
placed
themselves
to
juanito
great
desperation
beside
the
post
of
the
how
this
asked
paulita
guilelessly
are
those
the
savages
that
you
spoke
of
no
replied
the
imperturbable
juanito
there
a
mistake
got
their
places
mixed
those
coming
behind
those
with
the
whips
juanito
nodded
assent
but
he
was
rather
perplexed
and
uneasy
so
those
girls
are
the
here
juanito
was
attacked
by
such
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
that
some
of
the
spectators
became
annoyed
put
him
out
put
the
consumptive
out
called
a
voice
consumptive
to
be
called
a
consumptive
before
paulita
juanito
wanted
to
find
the
blackguard
and
make
him
swallow
that
consumptive
observing
that
the
women
were
trying
to
hold
him
back
his
bravado
increased
and
he
became
more
conspicuously
ferocious
but
fortunately
it
was
don
custodio
who
had
made
the
diagnosis
and
he
fearful
of
attracting
attention
to
himself
pretended
to
hear
nothing
apparently
busy
with
his
criticism
of
the
play
if
it
were
that
i
am
with
you
remarked
juanito
rolling
his
eyes
like
some
dolls
that
are
moved
by
clockwork
and
to
make
the
resemblance
more
real
he
stuck
out
his
tongue
occasionally
thus
that
night
he
acquired
in
doña
victorina
eyes
the
reputation
of
being
brave
and
punctilious
so
she
decided
in
her
heart
that
she
would
marry
him
just
as
soon
as
don
tiburcio
was
out
of
the
way
paulita
became
sadder
and
sadder
in
thinking
about
how
the
girls
called
could
occupy
isagani
attention
for
the
name
had
certain
disagreeable
associations
that
came
from
the
slang
of
her
convent
at
length
the
first
act
was
concluded
the
marquis
taking
away
as
servants
serpolette
and
germaine
the
representative
of
timid
beauty
in
the
troupe
and
for
coachman
the
stupid
grenicheux
a
burst
of
applause
brought
them
out
again
holding
hands
those
who
five
seconds
before
had
been
tormenting
one
another
and
were
about
to
come
to
blows
bowing
and
smiling
here
and
there
to
the
gallant
manila
public
and
exchanging
knowing
looks
with
various
spectators
while
there
prevailed
the
passing
tumult
occasioned
by
those
who
crowded
one
another
to
get
into
the
greenroom
and
felicitate
the
actresses
and
by
those
who
were
going
to
make
calls
on
the
ladies
in
the
boxes
some
expressed
their
opinions
of
the
play
and
the
players
undoubtedly
serpolette
is
the
best
said
one
with
a
knowing
air
i
prefer
germaine
she
an
ideal
blonde
but
she
has
any
voice
what
do
i
care
about
the
voice
well
for
shape
the
tall
one
pshaw
said
not
a
one
is
worth
a
straw
not
a
one
is
an
artist
was
the
critic
for
grito
de
la
and
his
disdainful
air
gave
him
great
importance
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
were
satisfied
with
so
little
serpolette
has
any
voice
nor
germaine
grace
nor
is
that
music
nor
is
it
art
nor
is
it
anything
he
concluded
with
marked
contempt
to
set
oneself
up
as
a
great
critic
there
is
nothing
like
appearing
to
be
discontented
with
everything
besides
the
management
had
sent
only
two
seats
for
the
newspaper
staff
in
the
boxes
curiosity
was
aroused
as
to
who
could
be
the
possessor
of
the
empty
one
for
that
person
would
surpass
every
one
in
chic
since
he
would
be
the
last
to
arrive
the
rumor
started
somewhere
that
it
belonged
to
simoun
and
was
confirmed
no
one
had
seen
the
jeweler
in
the
reserved
seats
the
greenroom
or
anywhere
else
yet
i
saw
him
this
afternoon
with
jouay
some
one
said
he
presented
a
necklace
to
one
of
the
actresses
to
which
one
asked
some
of
the
inquisitive
ladies
to
the
finest
of
all
the
one
who
made
eyes
at
his
excellency
this
information
was
received
with
looks
of
intelligence
winks
exclamations
of
doubt
of
confirmation
and
commentaries
he
trying
to
play
the
monte
cristo
remarked
a
lady
who
prided
herself
on
being
literary
or
purveyor
to
the
palace
added
her
escort
jealous
of
simoun
in
the
students
box
pecson
sandoval
and
isagani
had
remained
while
tadeo
had
gone
to
engage
don
custodio
in
conversation
about
his
projects
and
makaraig
to
hold
an
interview
with
pepay
in
no
way
as
i
have
observed
to
you
before
friend
isagani
declared
sandoval
with
violent
gestures
and
a
sonorous
voice
so
that
the
ladies
near
the
box
the
daughters
of
the
rich
man
who
was
in
debt
to
tadeo
might
hear
him
in
no
way
does
the
french
language
possess
the
rich
sonorousness
or
the
varied
and
elegant
cadence
of
the
castilian
tongue
i
can
not
conceive
i
can
not
imagine
i
can
not
form
any
idea
of
french
orators
and
i
doubt
that
they
have
ever
had
any
or
can
have
any
now
in
the
strict
construction
of
the
term
orator
because
we
must
not
confuse
the
name
orator
with
the
words
babbler
and
charlatan
for
these
can
exist
in
any
country
in
all
the
regions
of
the
inhabited
world
among
the
cold
and
curt
englishmen
as
among
the
lively
and
impressionable
frenchmen
thus
he
delivered
a
magnificent
review
of
the
nations
with
his
poetical
characterizations
and
most
resounding
epithets
isagani
nodded
assent
with
his
thoughts
fixed
on
paulita
whom
he
had
surprised
gazing
at
him
with
an
expressive
look
which
contained
a
wealth
of
meaning
he
tried
to
divine
what
those
eyes
were
expressing
those
eyes
that
were
so
eloquent
and
not
at
all
deceptive
now
you
who
are
a
poet
a
slave
to
rhyme
and
meter
a
son
of
the
muses
continued
sandoval
with
an
elegant
wave
of
his
hand
as
though
he
were
saluting
on
the
horizon
the
nine
sisters
do
you
comprehend
can
you
conceive
how
a
language
so
harsh
and
unmusical
as
french
can
give
birth
to
poets
of
such
gigantic
stature
as
our
garcilasos
our
herreras
our
esproncedas
our
calderons
nevertheless
objected
pecson
victor
hugo
victor
hugo
my
friend
pecson
if
victor
hugo
is
a
poet
it
is
because
he
owes
it
to
spain
because
it
is
an
established
fact
it
is
a
matter
beyond
all
doubt
a
thing
admitted
even
by
the
frenchmen
themselves
so
envious
of
spain
that
if
victor
hugo
has
genius
if
he
really
is
a
poet
it
is
because
his
childhood
was
spent
in
madrid
there
he
drank
in
his
first
impressions
there
his
brain
was
molded
there
his
imagination
was
colored
his
heart
modeled
and
the
most
beautiful
concepts
of
his
mind
born
and
after
all
who
is
victor
hugo
is
he
to
be
compared
at
all
with
our
modern
this
peroration
was
cut
short
by
the
return
of
makaraig
with
a
despondent
air
and
a
bitter
smile
on
his
lips
carrying
in
his
hand
a
note
which
he
offered
silently
to
sandoval
who
read
my
dove
your
letter
has
reached
me
late
for
i
have
already
handed
in
my
decision
and
it
has
been
approved
however
as
if
i
had
guessed
your
wish
i
have
decided
the
matter
according
to
the
desires
of
your
protégés
i
be
at
the
theater
and
wait
for
you
after
the
performance
your
duckling
custodining
how
tender
the
man
is
exclaimed
tadeo
with
emotion
well
said
sandoval
i
do
see
anything
wrong
about
this
quite
the
reverse
yes
rejoined
makaraig
with
his
bitter
smile
decided
favorably
i
just
seen
padre
irene
what
does
padre
irene
say
inquired
pecson
the
same
as
don
custodio
and
the
rascal
still
had
the
audacity
to
congratulate
me
the
commission
which
has
taken
as
its
own
the
decision
of
the
arbiter
approves
the
idea
and
felicitates
the
students
on
their
patriotism
and
their
thirst
for
knowledge
well
only
that
considering
our
duties
in
short
it
says
that
in
order
that
the
idea
may
not
be
lost
it
concludes
that
the
direction
and
execution
of
the
plan
should
be
placed
in
charge
of
one
of
the
religious
corporations
in
case
the
dominicans
do
not
wish
to
incorporate
the
academy
with
the
university
exclamations
of
disappointment
greeted
the
announcement
isagani
rose
but
said
nothing
and
in
order
that
we
may
participate
in
the
management
of
the
academy
makaraig
went
on
we
are
intrusted
with
the
collection
of
contributions
and
dues
with
the
obligation
of
turning
them
over
to
the
treasurer
whom
the
corporation
may
designate
which
treasurer
will
issue
us
receipts
then
we
remarked
tadeo
sandoval
said
pecson
there
the
gauntlet
take
it
up
huh
that
not
a
gauntlet
from
its
odor
it
seems
more
like
a
sock
the
funniest
part
of
it
makaraig
added
is
that
padre
irene
has
advised
us
to
celebrate
the
event
with
a
banquet
or
a
torchlight
procession
a
public
demonstration
of
the
students
to
render
thanks
to
all
the
persons
who
have
intervened
in
the
affair
yes
after
the
blow
let
sing
and
give
thanks
flumina
babylonis
yes
a
banquet
like
that
of
the
convicts
said
tadeo
a
banquet
at
which
we
all
wear
mourning
and
deliver
funeral
orations
added
sandoval
a
serenade
with
the
marseillaise
and
funeral
marches
proposed
isagani
no
gentlemen
observed
pecson
with
his
clownish
grin
to
celebrate
the
event
there
nothing
like
a
banquet
in
a
served
by
the
chinamen
without
camisas
i
insist
without
camisas
the
sarcasm
and
grotesqueness
of
this
idea
won
it
ready
acceptance
sandoval
being
the
first
to
applaud
it
for
he
had
long
wished
to
see
the
interior
of
one
of
those
establishments
which
at
night
appeared
to
be
so
merry
and
cheerful
just
as
the
orchestra
struck
up
for
the
second
act
the
young
men
arose
and
left
the
theater
to
the
scandal
of
the
whole
house
chapter
xxiii
a
corpse
simoun
had
not
in
fact
gone
to
the
theater
already
at
seven
in
the
evening
he
had
left
his
house
looking
worried
and
gloomy
his
servants
saw
him
return
twice
accompanied
by
different
individuals
and
at
eight
makaraig
encountered
him
pacing
along
calle
hospital
near
the
nunnery
of
clara
just
when
the
bells
of
its
church
were
ringing
a
funeral
knell
at
nine
camaroncocido
saw
him
again
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
theater
speak
with
a
person
who
seemed
to
be
a
student
pay
the
latter
admission
to
the
show
and
again
disappear
among
the
shadows
of
the
trees
what
is
it
to
me
again
muttered
camaroncocido
what
do
i
get
out
of
watching
over
the
populace
basilio
as
makaraig
said
had
not
gone
to
the
show
the
poor
student
after
returning
from
san
diego
whither
he
had
gone
to
ransom
juli
his
future
bride
from
her
servitude
had
turned
again
to
his
studies
spending
his
time
in
the
hospital
in
studying
or
in
nursing
capitan
tiago
whose
affliction
he
was
trying
to
cure
the
invalid
had
become
an
intolerable
character
during
his
bad
spells
when
he
felt
depressed
from
lack
of
opium
the
doses
of
which
basilio
was
trying
to
reduce
he
would
scold
mistreat
and
abuse
the
boy
who
bore
it
resignedly
conscious
that
he
was
doing
good
to
one
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
and
yielded
only
in
the
last
extremity
his
vicious
appetite
satisfied
capitan
tiago
would
fall
into
a
good
humor
become
tender
and
call
him
his
son
tearfully
recalling
the
youth
services
how
well
he
administered
the
estates
and
would
even
talk
of
making
him
his
heir
basilio
would
smile
bitterly
and
reflect
that
in
this
world
complaisance
with
vice
is
rewarded
better
than
fulfilment
of
duty
not
a
few
times
did
he
feel
tempted
to
give
free
rein
to
the
craving
and
conduct
his
benefactor
to
the
grave
by
a
path
of
flowers
and
smiling
illusions
rather
than
lengthen
his
life
along
a
road
of
sacrifice
what
a
fool
i
am
he
often
said
to
himself
people
are
stupid
and
then
pay
for
it
but
he
would
shake
his
head
as
he
thought
of
juli
of
the
wide
future
before
him
he
counted
upon
living
without
a
stain
on
his
conscience
so
he
continued
the
treatment
prescribed
and
bore
everything
patiently
yet
with
all
his
care
the
sick
man
except
for
short
periods
of
improvement
grew
worse
basilio
had
planned
gradually
to
reduce
the
amount
of
the
dose
or
at
least
not
to
let
him
injure
himself
by
increasing
it
but
on
returning
from
the
hospital
or
some
visit
he
would
find
his
patient
in
the
heavy
slumber
produced
by
the
opium
driveling
pale
as
a
corpse
the
young
man
could
not
explain
whence
the
drug
came
the
only
two
persons
who
visited
the
house
were
simoun
and
padre
irene
the
former
rarely
while
the
latter
never
ceased
exhorting
him
to
be
severe
and
inexorable
with
the
treatment
to
take
no
notice
of
the
invalid
ravings
for
the
main
object
was
to
save
him
do
your
duty
young
man
was
padre
irene
constant
admonition
do
your
duty
then
he
would
deliver
a
sermon
on
this
topic
with
such
great
conviction
and
enthusiasm
that
basilio
would
begin
to
feel
kindly
toward
the
preacher
besides
padre
irene
promised
to
get
him
a
fine
assignment
a
good
province
and
even
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
having
him
appointed
a
professor
without
being
carried
away
by
illusions
basilio
pretended
to
believe
in
them
and
went
on
obeying
the
dictates
of
his
own
conscience
that
night
while
cloches
de
was
being
presented
basilio
was
studying
at
an
old
table
by
the
light
of
an
whose
thick
glass
globe
partly
illuminated
his
melancholy
features
an
old
skull
some
human
bones
and
a
few
books
carefully
arranged
covered
the
table
whereon
there
was
also
a
pan
of
water
with
a
sponge
the
smell
of
opium
that
proceeded
from
the
adjoining
bedroom
made
the
air
heavy
and
inclined
him
to
sleep
but
he
overcame
the
desire
by
bathing
his
temples
and
eyes
from
time
to
time
determined
not
to
go
to
sleep
until
he
had
finished
the
book
which
he
had
borrowed
and
must
return
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
a
volume
of
the
legal
y
of
friata
the
only
book
that
the
professor
would
use
and
basilio
lacked
money
to
buy
a
copy
since
under
the
pretext
of
its
being
forbidden
by
the
censor
in
manila
and
the
necessity
for
bribing
many
government
employees
to
get
it
in
the
booksellers
charged
a
high
price
for
it
so
absorbed
wras
the
youth
in
his
studies
that
he
had
not
given
any
attention
at
all
to
some
pamphlets
that
had
been
sent
to
him
from
some
unknown
source
pamphlets
that
treated
of
the
philippines
among
which
figured
those
that
were
attracting
the
greatest
notice
at
the
time
because
of
their
harsh
and
insulting
manner
of
referring
to
the
natives
of
the
country
basilio
had
no
time
to
open
them
and
he
was
perhaps
restrained
also
by
the
thought
that
there
is
nothing
pleasant
about
receiving
an
insult
or
a
provocation
without
having
any
means
of
replying
or
defending
oneself
the
censorship
in
fact
permitted
insults
to
the
filipinos
but
prohibited
replies
on
their
part
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
that
reigned
in
the
house
broken
only
by
a
feeble
snore
that
issued
now
and
then
from
the
adjoining
bedroom
basilio
heard
light
footfalls
on
the
stairs
footfalls
that
soon
crossed
the
hallway
and
approached
the
room
where
he
was
raising
his
head
he
saw
the
door
open
and
to
his
great
surprise
appeared
the
sinister
figure
of
the
jeweler
simoun
who
since
the
scene
in
san
diego
had
not
come
to
visit
either
himself
or
capitan
tiago
how
is
the
sick
man
he
inquired
throwing
a
rapid
glance
about
the
room
and
fixing
his
attention
on
the
pamphlets
the
leaves
of
which
were
still
uncut
the
beating
of
his
heart
is
scarcely
perceptible
his
pulse
is
very
weak
his
appetite
entirely
gone
replied
basilio
in
a
low
voice
with
a
sad
smile
he
sweats
profusely
in
the
early
morning
noticing
that
simoun
kept
his
face
turned
toward
the
pamphlets
and
fearing
that
he
might
reopen
the
subject
of
their
conversation
in
the
wood
he
went
on
his
system
is
saturated
with
poison
he
may
die
any
day
as
though
struck
by
lightning
the
least
irritation
any
excitement
may
kill
him
like
the
philippines
observed
simoun
lugubriously
basilio
was
unable
to
refrain
from
a
gesture
of
impatience
but
he
was
determined
not
to
recur
to
the
old
subject
so
he
proceeded
as
if
he
had
heard
nothing
what
weakens
him
the
most
is
the
nightmares
his
terrors
like
the
government
again
interrupted
simoun
several
nights
ago
he
awoke
in
the
dark
and
thought
that
he
had
gone
blind
he
raised
a
disturbance
lamenting
and
scolding
me
saying
that
i
had
put
his
eyes
out
when
i
entered
his
room
with
a
light
he
mistook
me
for
padre
irene
and
called
me
his
saviour
like
the
government
exactly
last
night
continued
basilio
paying
no
attention
he
got
up
begging
for
his
favorite
the
one
that
died
three
years
ago
and
i
had
to
give
him
a
chicken
then
he
heaped
blessings
upon
me
and
promised
me
many
thousands
at
that
instant
a
clock
struck
ten
simoun
shuddered
and
stopped
the
youth
with
a
gesture
basilio
he
said
in
a
low
tense
voice
listen
to
me
carefully
for
the
moments
are
precious
i
see
that
you
have
opened
the
pamphlets
that
i
sent
you
you
not
interested
in
your
country
the
youth
started
to
protest
it
useless
went
on
simoun
dryly
within
an
hour
the
revolution
is
going
to
break
out
at
a
signal
from
me
and
tomorrow
be
no
studies
there
be
no
university
there
be
nothing
but
fighting
and
butchery
i
have
everything
ready
and
my
success
is
assured
when
we
triumph
all
those
who
could
have
helped
us
and
did
not
do
so
will
be
treated
as
enemies
basilio
i
come
to
offer
you
death
or
a
future
death
or
a
future
the
boy
echoed
as
though
he
did
not
understand
with
us
or
with
the
government
rejoined
simoun
with
your
country
or
with
your
oppressors
decide
for
time
presses
i
come
to
save
you
because
of
the
memories
that
unite
us
with
my
country
or
with
the
oppressors
repeated
basilio
in
a
low
tone
the
youth
was
stupefied
he
gazed
at
the
jeweler
with
eyes
in
which
terror
was
reflected
he
felt
his
limbs
turn
cold
while
a
thousand
confused
ideas
whirled
about
in
his
mind
he
saw
the
streets
running
blood
he
heard
the
firing
he
found
himself
among
the
dead
and
wounded
and
by
the
peculiar
force
of
his
inclinations
fancied
himself
in
an
operator
blouse
cutting
off
legs
and
extracting
bullets
the
will
of
the
government
is
in
my
hands
said
simoun
diverted
and
wasted
its
feeble
strength
and
resources
on
foolish
expeditions
dazzling
it
with
the
plunder
it
might
seize
its
heads
are
now
in
the
theater
calm
and
unsuspecting
thinking
of
a
night
of
pleasure
but
not
one
shall
again
repose
upon
a
pillow
i
have
men
and
regiments
at
my
disposition
some
i
have
led
to
believe
that
the
uprising
is
ordered
by
the
general
others
that
the
friars
are
bringing
it
about
some
i
have
bought
with
promises
with
employments
with
money
many
very
many
are
acting
from
revenge
because
they
are
oppressed
and
see
it
as
a
matter
of
killing
or
being
killed
cabesang

is
below
he
has
come
with
me
here
again
i
ask
you
will
you
come
with
us
or
do
you
prefer
to
expose
yourself
to
the
resentment
of
my
followers
in
critical
moments
to
declare
oneself
neutral
is
to
be
exposed
to
the
wrath
of
both
the
contending
parties
basilio
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
face
several
times
as
if
he
were
trying
to
wake
from
a
nightmare
he
felt
that
his
brow
was
cold
decide
repeated
simoun
and
what
what
would
i
have
to
do
asked
the
youth
in
a
weak
and
broken
voice
a
very
simple
thing
replied
simoun
his
face
lighting
up
with
a
ray
of
hope
as
i
have
to
direct
the
movement
i
can
not
get
away
from
the
scene
of
action
i
want
you
while
the
attention
of
the
whole
city
is
directed
elsewhere
at
the
head
of
a
company
to
force
the
doors
of
the
nunnery
of
clara
and
take
from
there
a
person
whom
only
you
besides
myself
and
capitan
tiago
can
recognize
you
run
no
risk
at
all
maria
clara
exclaimed
basilio
yes
maria
clara
repeated
simoun
and
for
the
first
time
his
voice
became
human
and
compassionate
i
want
to
save
her
to
save
her
i
have
wished
to
live
i
have
returned
i
am
starting
the
revolution
because
only
a
revolution
can
open
the
doors
of
the
nunneries
ay
sighed
basilio
clasping
his
hands
you
come
late
too
late
why
inquired
simoun
with
a
frown
maria
clara
is
dead
simoun
arose
with
a
bound
and
stood
over
the
youth
she
dead
he
demanded
in
a
terrible
voice
this
afternoon
at
six
by
now
she
must
be
it
a
lie
roared
simoun
pale
and
beside
himself
false
maria
clara
lives
maria
clara
must
live
it
a
cowardly
excuse
she
not
dead
and
this
night
i
free
her
or
tomorrow
you
die
basilio
shrugged
his
shoulders
several
days
ago
she
was
taken
ill
and
i
went
to
the
nunnery
for
news
of
her
look
here
is
padre
letter
brought
by
padre
irene
capitan
tiago
wept
all
the
evening
kissing
his
daughter
picture
and
begging
her
forgiveness
until
at
last
he
smoked
an
enormous
quantity
of
opium
this
evening
her
knell
was
tolled
ah
exclaimed
simoun
pressing
his
hands
to
his
head
and
standing
motionless
he
remembered
to
have
actually
heard
the
knell
while
he
was
pacing
about
in
the
vicinity
of
the
nunnery
dead
he
murmured
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
ghost
whispering
dead
dead
without
my
having
seen
her
dead
without
knowing
that
i
lived
for
her
dead
feeling
a
terrible
storm
a
tempest
of
whirlwind
and
thunder
without
a
drop
of
water
sobs
without
tears
cries
without
words
rage
in
his
breast
and
threaten
to
burst
out
like
burning
lava
long
repressed
he
rushed
precipitately
from
the
room
basilio
heard
him
descend
the
stairs
with
unsteady
tread
stepping
heavily
he
heard
a
stifled
cry
a
cry
that
seemed
to
presage
death
so
solemn
deep
and
sad
that
he
arose
from
his
chair
pale
and
trembling
but
he
could
hear
the
footsteps
die
away
and
the
noisy
closing
of
the
door
to
the
street
poor
fellow
he
murmured
while
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
heedless
now
of
his
studies
he
let
his
gaze
wander
into
space
as
he
pondered
over
the
fate
of
those
two
beings
he
young
rich
educated
master
of
his
fortunes
with
a
brilliant
future
before
him
she
fair
as
a
dream
pure
full
of
faith
and
innocence
nurtured
amid
love
and
laughter
destined
to
a
happy
existence
to
be
adored
in
the
family
and
respected
in
the
world
and
yet
of
those
two
beings
filled
with
love
with
illusions
and
hopes
by
a
fatal
destiny
he
wandered
over
the
world
dragged
ceaselessly
through
a
whirl
of
blood
and
tears
sowing
evil
instead
of
doing
good
undoing
virtue
and
encouraging
vice
while
she
was
dying
in
the
mysterious
shadows
of
the
cloister
where
she
had
sought
peace
and
perhaps
found
suffering
where
she
entered
pure
and
stainless
and
expired
like
a
crushed
flower

my
hapless

in
their
prime

a
people
can
not
offer
its
daughters

on
the
following
day
thursday
at
the
hour
of
sunset
isagani
was
walking
along
the
beautiful
promenade
of
maria
cristina
in
the
direction
of
the
malecon
to
keep
an
appointment
which
paulita
had
that
morning
given
him
the
young
man
had
no
doubt
that
they
were
to
talk
about
what
had
happened
on
the
previous
night
and
as
he
was
determined
to
ask
for
an
explanation
and
knew
how
proud
and
haughty
she
was
he
foresaw
an
estrangement
in
view
of
this
eventuality
he
had
brought
with
him
the
only
two
letters
he
had
ever
received
from
paulita
two
scraps
of
paper
whereon
were
merely
a
few
hurriedly
written
lines
with
various
blots
but
in
an
even
handwriting
things
that
did
not
prevent
the
enamored
youth
from
preserving
them
with
more
solicitude
than
if
they
had
been
the
autographs
of
sappho
and
the
muse
polyhymnia
this
decision
to
sacrifice
his
love
on
the
altar
of
dignity
the
consciousness
of
suffering
in
the
discharge
of
duty
did
not
prevent
a
profound
melancholy
from
taking
possession
of
isagani
and
brought
back
into
his
mind
the
beautiful
days
and
nights
more
beautiful
still
when
they
had
whispered
sweet
nothings
through
the
flowered
gratings
of
the
entresol
nothings
that
to
the
youth
took
on
such
a
character
of
seriousness
and
importance
that
they
seemed
to
him
the
only
matters
worthy
of
meriting
the
attention
of
the
most
exalted
human
understanding
he
recalled
the
walks
on
moonlit
nights
the
fair
the
dark
december
mornings
after
the
mass
of
nativity
the
holy
water
that
he
used
to
offer
her
when
she
would
thank
him
with
a
look
charged
with
a
whole
epic
of
love
both
of
them
trembling
as
their
fingers
touched
heavy
sighs
like
small
rockets
issued
from
his
breast
and
brought
back
to
him
all
the
verses
all
the
sayings
of
poets
and
writers
about
the
inconstancy
of
woman
inwardly
he
cursed
the
creation
of
theaters
the
french
operetta
and
vowed
to
get
revenge
on
pelaez
at
the
first
opportunity
everything
about
him
appeared
under
the
saddest
and
somberest
colors
the
bay
deserted
and
solitary
seemed
more
solitary
still
on
account
of
the
few
steamers
that
were
anchored
in
it
the
sun
was
dying
behind
mariveles
without
poetry
or
enchantment
without
the
capricious
and
richly
tinted
clouds
of
happier
evenings
the
anda
monument
in
bad
taste
mean
and
squat
without
style
without
grandeur
looked
like
a
lump
of
or
at
best
a
chunk
of
cake
the
people
who
were
promenading
along
the
malecon
in
spite
of
their
complacent
and
contented
air
appeared
distant
haughty
and
vain
mischievous
and
the
boys
that
played
on
the
beach
skipping
flat
stones
over
the
surface
of
the
water
or
searching
in
the
sand
for
mollusks
and
crustaceans
which
they
caught
for
the
mere
fun
of
catching
and
killed
without
benefit
to
themselves
in
short
even
the
eternal
port
works
to
which
he
had
dedicated
more
than
three
odes
looked
to
him
absurd
ridiculous
child
play
the
port
ah
the
port
of
manila
a
bastard
that
since
its
conception
had
brought
tears
of
humiliation
and
shame
to
all
if
only
after
so
many
tears
there
were
not
being
brought
forth
a
useless
abortion
abstractedly
he
saluted
two
jesuits
former
teachers
of
his
and
scarcely
noticed
a
tandem
in
which
an
american
rode
and
excited
the
envy
of
the
gallants
who
were
in
calesas
only
near
the
anda
monument
he
heard
talking
with
another
person
about
simoun
learning
that
the
latter
had
on
the
previous
night
been
taken
suddenly
ill
that
he
refused
to
see
any
one
even
the
very
aides
of
the
general
yes
exclaimed
isagani
with
a
bitter
smile
for
him
attentions
because
he
is
rich
the
soldiers
return
from
their
expeditions
sick
and
wounded
but
no
one
visits
them
musing
over
these
expeditions
over
the
fate
of
the
poor
soldiers
over
the
resistance
offered
by
the
islanders
to
the
foreign
yoke
he
thought
that
death
for
death
if
that
of
the
soldiers
was
glorious
because
they
were
obeying
orders
that
of
the
islanders
was
sublime
because
they
were
defending
their
homes
a
strange
destiny
that
of
some
peoples
he
mused
because
a
traveler
arrives
at
their
shores
they
lose
their
liberty
and
become
subjects
and
slaves
not
only
of
the
traveler
not
only
of
his
heirs
but
even
of
all
his
countrymen
and
not
for
a
generation
but
for
all
time
a
strange
conception
of
justice
such
a
state
of
affairs
gives
ample
right
to
exterminate
every
foreigner
as
the
most
ferocious
monster
that
the
sea
can
cast
up
he
reflected
that
those
islanders
against
whom
his
country
was
waging
war
after
all
were
guilty
of
no
crime
other
than
that
of
weakness
the
travelers
also
arrived
at
the
shores
of
other
peoples
but
finding
them
strong
made
no
display
of
their
strange
pretension
with
all
their
weakness
the
spectacle
they
presented
seemed
beautiful
to
him
and
the
names
of
the
enemies
whom
the
newspapers
did
not
fail
to
call
cowards
and
traitors
appeared
glorious
to
him
as
they
succumbed
with
glory
amid
the
ruins
of
their
crude
fortifications
with
greater
glory
even
than
the
ancient
trojan
heroes
for
those
islanders
had
carried
away
no
philippine
helen
in
his
poetic
enthusiasm
he
thought
of
the
young
men
of
those
islands
who
could
cover
themselves
with
glory
in
the
eyes
of
their
women
and
in
his
amorous
desperation
he
envied
them
because
they
could
find
a
brilliant
suicide
ah
i
should
like
to
die
he
exclaimed
be
reduced
to
nothingness
leave
to
my
native
land
a
glorious
name
perish
in
its
cause
defending
it
from
foreign
invasion
and
then
let
the
sun
afterwards
illumine
my
corpse
like
a
motionless
sentinel
on
the
rocks
of
the
sea
the
conflict
with
the
germans
came
into
his
mind
and
he
almost
felt
sorry
that
it
had
been
adjusted
he
would
gladly
have
died
for
the
banner
before
submitting
to
the
foreigner
because
after
all
he
mused
with
spain
we
are
united
by
firm
bonds
the
past
history
religion
language
language
yes
language
a
sarcastic
smile
curled
his
lips
that
very
night
they
would
hold
a
banquet
in
the
to
the
demise
of
the
academy
of
castilian
ay
he
sighed
provided
the
liberals
in
spain
are
like
those
we
have
here
in
a
little
while
the
mother
country
will
be
able
to
count
the
number
of
the
faithful
slowly
the
night
descended
and
with
it
melancholy
settled
more
heavily
upon
the
heart
of
the
young
man
who
had
almost
lost
hope
of
seeing
paulita
the
promenaders
one
by
one
left
the
malecon
for
the
luneta
the
music
from
which
was
borne
to
him
in
snatches
of
melodies
on
the
fresh
evening
breeze
the
sailors
on
a
warship
anchored
in
the
river
performed
their
evening
drill
skipping
about
among
the
slender
ropes
like
spiders
the
boats
one
by
one
lighted
their
lamps
thus
giving
signs
of
life
while
the
beach
do
el
viento
riza
las
calladas
olas
que
con
blando
murmullo
en
la
ribera
se
deslizan
veloces
por
sí
solas
as
alaejos
says
exhaled
in
the
distance
thin
vapors
that
the
moon
now
at
its
full
gradually
converted
into
mysterious
transparent
gauze
a
distant
sound
became
audible
a
noise
that
rapidly
approached
isagani
turned
his
head
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
violently
a
carriage
was
coming
drawn
by
white
horses
the
white
horses
that
he
would
know
among
a
hundred
thousand
in
the
carriage
rode
paulita
and
her
friend
of
the
night
before
with
doña
victorina
before
the
young
man
could
take
a
step
paulita
had
leaped
to
the
ground
with
agility
and
smiled
at
him
with
a
smile
full
of
conciliation
he
smiled
in
return
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
clouds
all
the
black
thoughts
that
before
had
beset
him
vanished
like
smoke
the
sky
lighted
up
the
breeze
sang
flowers
covered
the
grass
by
the
roadside
but
unfortunately
doña
victorina
was
there
and
she
pounced
upon
the
young
man
to
ask
him
for
news
of
don
tiburcio
since
isagani
had
undertaken
to
discover
his
by
inquiry
among
the
students
he
knew
no
one
has
been
able
to
tell
me
up
to
now
he
answered
and
he
was
telling
the
truth
for
don
tiburcio
was
really
hidden
in
the
house
of
the
youth
own
uncle
padre
florentino
let
him
know
declared
doña
victorina
furiously
that
i
call
in
the
civil
guard
alive
or
dead
i
want
to
know
where
he
is
because
one
has
to
wait
ten
years
before
marrying
again
isagani
gazed
at
her
in
fright
doña
victorina
was
thinking
of
remarrying
who
could
the
unfortunate
be
what
do
you
think
of
juanito
pelaez
she
asked
him
suddenly
juanito
isagani
knew
not
what
to
reply
he
was
tempted
to
tell
all
the
evil
he
knew
of
pelaez
but
a
feeling
of
delicacy
triumphed
in
his
heart
and
he
spoke
well
of
his
rival
for
the
very
reason
that
he
was
such
doña
victorina
entirely
satisfied
and
becoming
enthusiastic
then
broke
out
into
exaggerations
of
pelaez
merits
and
was
already
going
to
make
isagani
a
confidant
of
her
new
passion
when
friend
came
running
to
say
that
the
former
fan
had
fallen
among
the
stones
of
the
beach
near
the
malecon
stratagem
or
accident
the
fact
is
that
this
mischance
gave
an
excuse
for
the
friend
to
remain
with
the
old
woman
while
isagani
might
talk
with
paulita
moreover
it
was
a
matter
of
rejoicing
to
doña
victorina
since
to
get
juanito
for
herself
she
was
favoring
isagani
love
paulita
had
her
plan
ready
on
thanking
him
she
assumed
the
role
of
the
offended
party
showed
resentment
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
was
surprised
to
meet
him
there
when
everybody
was
on
the
luneta
even
the
french
actresses
you
made
the
appointment
for
me
how
could
i
be
elsewhere
yet
last
night
you
did
not
even
notice
that
i
was
in
the
theater
i
was
watching
you
all
the
time
and
you
never
took
your
eyes
off
those
so
they
exchanged
parts
isagani
who
had
come
to
demand
explanations
found
himself
compelled
to
give
them
and
considered
himself
very
happy
when
paulita
said
that
she
forgave
him
in
regard
to
her
presence
at
the
theater
he
even
had
to
thank
her
for
that
forced
by
her
aunt
she
had
decided
to
go
in
the
hope
of
seeing
him
during
the
performance
little
she
cared
for
juanito
pelaez
my
aunt
the
one
who
is
in
love
with
him
she
said
with
a
merry
laugh
then
they
both
laughed
for
the
marriage
of
pelaez
with
doña
victorina
made
them
really
happy
and
they
saw
it
already
an
accomplished
fact
until
isagani
remembered
that
don
tiburcio
was
still
living
and
confided
the
secret
to
his
sweetheart
after
exacting
her
promise
that
she
would
tell
no
one
paulita
promised
with
the
mental
reservation
of
relating
it
to
her
friend
this
led
the
conversation
to
isagani
town
surrounded
by
forests
situated
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
which
roared
at
the
base
of
the
high
cliffs
isagani
gaze
lighted
up
when
he
spoke
of
that
obscure
spot
a
flush
of
pride
overspread
his
cheeks
his
voice
trembled
his
poetic
imagination
glowed
his
words
poured
forth
burning
charged
with
enthusiasm
as
if
he
were
talking
of
love
to
his
love
and
he
could
not
but
exclaim
oh
in
the
solitude
of
my
mountains
i
feel
free
free
as
the
air
as
the
light
that
shoots
unbridled
through
space
a
thousand
cities
a
thousand
palaces
would
i
give
for
that
spot
in
the
philippines
where
far
from
men
i
could
feel
myself
to
have
genuine
liberty
there
face
to
face
with
nature
in
the
presence
of
the
mysterious
and
the
infinite
the
forest
and
the
sea
i
think
speak
and
work
like
a
man
who
knows
not
tyrants
in
the
presence
of
such
enthusiasm
for
his
native
place
an
enthusiasm
that
she
did
not
comprehend
for
she
was
accustomed
to
hear
her
country
spoken
ill
of
and
sometimes
joined
in
the
chorus
herself
paulita
manifested
some
jealousy
as
usual
making
herself
the
offended
party
but
isagani
very
quickly
pacified
her
yes
he
said
i
loved
it
above
all
things
before
i
knew
you
it
was
my
delight
to
wander
through
the
thickets
to
sleep
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
to
seat
myself
upon
a
cliff
to
take
in
with
my
gaze
the
pacific
which
rolled
its
blue
waves
before
me
bringing
to
me
echoes
of
songs
learned
on
the
shores
of
free
america
before
knowing
you
that
sea
was
for
me
my
world
my
delight
my
love
my
dream
when
it
slept
in
calm
with
the
sun
shining
overhead
it
was
my
delight
to
gaze
into
the
abyss
hundreds
of
feet
below
me
seeking
monsters
in
the
forests
of
madrepores
and
coral
that
were
revealed
through
the
limpid
blue
enormous
serpents
that
the
country
folk
say
leave
the
forests
to
dwell
in
the
sea
and
there
take
on
frightful
forms
evening
they
say
is
the
time
when
the
sirens
appear
and
i
saw
them
between
the
waves
so
great
was
my
eagerness
that
once
i
thought
i
could
discern
them
amid
the
foam
busy
in
their
divine
sports
i
distinctly
heard
their
songs
songs
of
liberty
and
i
made
out
the
sounds
of
their
silvery
harps
formerly
i
spent
hours
and
hours
watching
the
transformations
in
the
clouds
or
gazing
at
a
solitary
tree
in
the
plain
or
a
high
rock
without
knowing
why
without
being
able
to
explain
the
vague
feelings
they
awoke
in
me
my
uncle
used
to
preach
long
sermons
to
me
and
fearing
that
i
would
become
a
hypochondriac
talked
of
placing
me
under
a
doctor
care
but
i
met
you
i
loved
you
and
during
the
last
vacation
it
seemed
that
something
was
lacking
there
the
forest
was
gloomy
sad
the
river
that
glides
through
the
shadows
dreary
the
sea
deserted
the
sky
ah
if
you
should
go
there
once
if
your
feet
should
press
those
paths
if
you
should
stir
the
waters
of
the
rivulet
with
your
fingers
if
you
should
gaze
upon
the
sea
sit
upon
the
cliff
or
make
the
air
ring
with
your
melodious
songs
my
forest
would
be
transformed
into
an
eden
the
ripples
of
the
brook
would
sing
light
would
burst
from
the
dark
leaves
into
diamonds
would
be
converted
the
dewdrops
and
into
pearls
the
foam
of
the
sea
but
paulita
had
heard
that
to
reach
isagani
home
it
was
necessary
to
cross
mountains
where
little
leeches
abounded
and
at
the
mere
thought
of
them
the
little
coward
shivered
convulsively
humored
and
petted
she
declared
that
she
would
travel
only
in
a
carriage
or
a
railway
train
having
now
forgotten
all
his
pessimism
and
seeing
only
thornless
roses
about
him
isagani
answered
within
a
short
time
all
the
islands
are
going
to
be
crossed
with
networks
of
iron
rails
donde
rápidas
y
voladoras
locomotoras
corriendo
irán
as
some
one
said
then
the
most
beautiful
spots
of
the
islands
will
be
accessible
to
all
then
but
when
when
i
an
old
woman
ah
you
do
know
what
we
can
do
in
a
few
years
replied
the
youth
you
do
realize
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
that
are
awakening
in
the
country
after
the
sleep
of
centuries
spain
heeds
us
our
young
men
in
madrid
are
working
day
and
night
dedicating
to
the
fatherland
all
their
intelligence
all
their
time
all
their
strength
generous
voices
there
are
mingled
with
ours
statesmen
who
realize
that
there
is
no
better
bond
than
community
of
thought
and
interest
justice
will
be
meted
out
to
us
and
everything
points
to
a
brilliant
future
for
all
it
true
that
we
just
met
with
a
slight
rebuff
we
students
but
victory
is
rolling
along
the
whole
line
it
is
in
the
consciousness
of
all
the
traitorous
repulse
that
we
have
suffered
indicates
the
last
gasp
the
final
convulsions
of
the
dying
tomorrow
we
shall
be
citizens
of
the
philippines
whose
destiny
will
be
a
glorious
one
because
it
will
be
in
loving
hands
ah
yes
the
future
is
ours
i
see
it
i
see
the
movement
that
stirs
the
life
of
these
regions
so
long
dead
lethargic
i
see
towns
arise
along
the
railroads
and
factories
everywhere
edifices
like
that
of
mandaloyan
i
hear
the
steam
hiss
the
trains
roar
the
engines
rattle
i
see
the
smoke
rise
their
heavy
breathing
i
smell
the
oil
the
sweat
of
monsters
busy
at
incessant
toil
this
port
so
slow
and
laborious
of
creation
this
river
where
commerce
is
in
its
death
agony
we
shall
see
covered
with
masts
giving
us
an
idea
of
the
forests
of
europe
in
winter
this
pure
air
and
these
stones
now
so
clean
will
be
crowded
with
coal
with
boxes
and
barrels
the
products
of
human
industry
but
let
it
not
matter
for
we
shall
move
about
rapidly
in
comfortable
coaches
to
seek
in
the
interior
other
air
other
scenes
on
other
shores
cooler
temperatures
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
the
warships
of
our
navy
will
guard
our
coasts
the
spaniard
and
the
filipino
will
rival
each
other
in
zeal
to
repel
all
foreign
invasion
to
defend
our
homes
and
let
you
bask
in
peace
and
smiles
loved
and
respected
free
from
the
system
of
exploitation
without
hatred
or
distrust
the
people
will
labor
because
then
labor
will
cease
to
be
a
despicable
thing
it
will
no
longer
be
servile
imposed
upon
a
slave
then
the
spaniard
will
not
embitter
his
character
with
ridiculous
pretensions
of
despotism
but
with
a
frank
look
and
a
stout
heart
we
shall
extend
our
hands
to
one
another
and
commerce
industry
agriculture
the
sciences
will
develop
under
the
mantle
of
liberty
with
wise
and
just
laws
as
in
prosperous
england
paulita
smiled
dubiously
and
shook
her
head
dreams
dreams
she
sighed
i
heard
it
said
that
you
have
many
enemies
aunt
says
that
this
country
must
always
be
enslaved
because
your
aunt
is
a
fool
because
she
ca
live
without
slaves
when
she
has
them
she
dreams
of
them
in
the
future
and
if
they
are
not
obtainable
she
forces
them
into
her
imagination
true
it
is
that
we
have
enemies
that
there
will
be
a
struggle
but
we
shall
conquer
the
old
system
may
convert
the
ruins
of
its
castle
into
formless
barricades
but
we
will
take
them
singing
hymns
of
liberty
in
the
light
of
the
eyes
of
you
women
to
the
applause
of
your
lovely
hands
but
do
not
be
uneasy
the
struggle
will
be
a
pacific
one
enough
that
you
spur
us
to
zeal
that
you
awake
in
us
noble
and
elevated
thoughts
and
encourage
us
to
constancy
to
heroism
with
your
affection
for
our
reward
paulita
preserved
her
enigmatic
smile
and
seemed
thoughtful
as
she
gazed
toward
the
river
patting
her
cheek
lightly
with
her
fan
but
if
you
accomplish
nothing
she
asked
abstractedly
the
question
hurt
isagani
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
sweetheart
caught
her
lightly
by
the
hand
and
began
listen
if
we
accomplish
nothing
he
paused
in
doubt
then
resumed
you
know
how
i
love
you
how
i
adore
you
you
know
that
i
feel
myself
a
different
creature
when
your
gaze
enfolds
me
when
i
surprise
in
it
the
flash
of
love
but
yet
if
we
accomplish
nothing
i
would
dream
of
another
look
of
yours
and
would
die
happy
because
the
light
of
pride
could
burn
in
your
eyes
when
you
pointed
to
my
corpse
and
said
to
the
world
love
died
fighting
for
the
rights
of
my
fatherland
come
home
child
you
going
to
catch
cold
screeched
doña
victorina
at
that
instant
and
the
voice
brought
them
back
to
reality
it
was
time
to
return
and
they
kindly
invited
him
to
enter
the
carriage
an
invitation
which
the
young
man
did
not
give
them
cause
to
repeat
as
it
was
paulita
carriage
naturally
doña
victorina
and
the
friend
occupied
the
back
seat
while
the
two
lovers
sat
on
the
smaller
one
in
front
to
ride
in
the
same
carriage
to
have
her
at
his
side
to
breathe
her
perfume
to
rub
against
the
silk
of
her
dress
to
see
her
pensive
with
folded
arms
lighted
by
the
moon
of
the
philippines
that
lends
to
the
meanest
things
idealism
and
enchantment
were
all
dreams
beyond
isagani
hopes
what
wretches
they
who
were
returning
alone
on
foot
and
had
to
give
way
to
the
swift
carriage
in
the
whole
course
of
the
drive
along
the
beach
and
down
the
length
of
la
sabana
across
the
bridge
of
spain
isagani
saw
nothing
but
a
sweet
profile
gracefully
set
off
by
beautiful
hair
ending
in
an
arching
neck
that
lost
itself
amid
the
gauzy
piña
a
diamond
winked
at
him
from
the
lobe
of
the
little
ear
like
a
star
among
silvery
clouds
he
heard
faint
echoes
inquiring
for
don
tiburcio
de
espadaña
the
name
of
juanito
pelaez
but
they
sounded
to
him
like
distant
bells
the
confused
noises
heard
in
a
dream
it
was
necessary
to
tell
him
that
they
had
reached
plaza
santa
cruz
chapter
xxv
smiles
and
tears
the
sala
of
the
macanista
de
buen
that
night
presented
an
extraordinary
aspect
fourteen
young
men
of
the
principal
islands
of
the
archipelago
from
the
pure
indian
if
there
be
pure
ones
to
the
peninsular
spaniard
were
met
to
hold
the
banquet
advised
by
padre
irene
in
view
of
the
happy
solution
of
the
affair
about
instruction
in
castilian
they
had
engaged
all
the
tables
for
themselves
ordered
the
lights
to
be
increased
and
had
posted
on
the
wall
beside
the
landscapes
and
chinese
kakemonos
this
strange
versicle
glory
to
custodio
for
his
cleverness
and
pansit
on
eabth
to
the
youths
of
good
will
in
a
country
where
everything
grotesque
is
covered
with
a
mantle
of
seriousness
where
many
rise
by
the
force
of
wind
and
hot
air
in
a
country
where
the
deeply
serious
and
sincere
may
do
damage
on
issuing
from
the
heart
and
may
cause
trouble
probably
this
was
the
best
way
to
celebrate
the
ingenious
inspiration
of
the
illustrious
don
custodio
the
mocked
replied
to
the
mockery
with
a
laugh
to
the
governmental
joke
with
a
plate
of
and
yet
they
laughed
and
jested
but
it
could
be
seen
that
the
merriment
was
forced
the
laughter
had
a
certain
nervous
ring
eyes
flashed
and
in
more
than
one
of
these
a
tear
glistened
nevertheless
these
young
men
were
cruel
they
were
unreasonable
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
their
most
beautiful
ideas
had
been
so
treated
that
their
hopes
had
been
defrauded
with
big
words
and
small
actions
before
this
don
custodio
there
had
been
many
very
many
others
in
the
center
of
the
room
under
the
red
lanterns
were
placed
four
round
tables
systematically
arranged
to
form
a
square
little
wooden
stools
equally
round
served
as
seats
in
the
middle
of
each
table
according
to
the
practise
of
the
establishment
were
arranged
four
small
colored
plates
with
four
pies
on
each
one
and
four
cups
of
tea
with
the
accompanying
dishes
all
of
red
porcelain
before
each
seat
was
a
bottle
and
two
glittering
sandoval
was
curious
and
gazed
about
scrutinizing
everything
tasting
the
food
examining
the
pictures
reading
the
bill
of
fare
the
others
conversed
on
the
topics
of
the
day
about
the
french
actresses
about
the
mysterious
illness
of
simoun
who
according
to
some
had
been
found
wounded
in
the
street
while
others
averred
that
he
had
attempted
to
commit
suicide
as
was
natural
all
lost
themselves
in
conjectures
tadeo
gave
his
particular
version
which
according
to
him
came
from
a
reliable
source
simoun
had
been
assaulted
by
some
unknown
person
in
the
old
plaza
vivac
the
motive
being
revenge
in
proof
of
which
was
the
fact
that
simoun
himself
refused
to
make
the
least
explanation
from
this
they
proceeded
to
talk
of
mysterious
revenges
and
naturally
of
monkish
pranks
each
one
relating
the
exploits
of
the
curate
of
his
town
a
notice
in
large
black
letters
crowned
the
frieze
of
the
room
with
this
warning
de
esta
fonda
el
cabecilla
al
publico
advierte
que
nada

absolutamente
sobre

mesa
ó

what
a
notice
exclaimed
sandoval
as
if
he
might
have
confidence
in
the
police
eh
and
what
verses
don
tiburcio
converted
into
a
quatrain
two
feet
one
longer
than
the
other
between
two
crutches
if
isagani
sees
them
he
present
them
to
his
future
aunt
here
isagani
called
a
voice
from
the
stairway
the
happy
youth
appeared
radiant
with
joy
followed
by
two
chinese
without
camisas
who
carried
on
enormous
waiters
tureens
that
gave
out
an
appetizing
odor
merry
exclamations
greeted
them
juanito
pelaez
was
missing
but
the
hour
fixed
had
already
passed
so
they
sat
down
happily
to
the
tables
juanito
was
always
unconventional
if
in
his
place
we
had
invited
basilio
said
tadeo
we
should
have
been
better
entertained
we
might
have
got
him
drunk
and
drawn
some
secrets
from
him
what
does
the
prudent
basilio
possess
secrets
i
should
say
so
replied
tadeo
of
the
most
important
kind
there
are
some
enigmas
to
which
he
alone
has
the
key
the
boy
who
disappeared
the
nun

and
i
do
know
what
else
as
let
us
offer
the
bones
to
don
custodio
to
see
if
he
will
project
something
with
them
a
burst
of
merry
laughter
greeted
this
sally
if
he
should
learn
he
come
concluded
sandoval
this
is
excellent
soup
what
is
it
called
that
is
chinese
to
distinguish
it
from
that
which
is
peculiar
to
this
country
bah
that
a
hard
name
to
remember
in
honor
of
don
custodio
i
christen

the
gentlemen
said
makaraig
who
had
prepared
the
menu
there
are
three
courses

made
of

which
should
be
dedicated
to

whispered
a
young
man
from
iloilo
to
his
neighbor
let
him
turn
his
nose
away
down
with
padre

cried
several
at
once
respect
gentlemen
more
respect
demanded
pecson
with
comic
gravity
the
third
course
is
a
lobster
pie
which
should
be
dedicated
to
the
friars
suggested
he
of
the
visayas
for
the
lobsters
sake
added
sandoval
right
and
call
it
friar
pie
the
whole
crowd
took
this
up
repeating
in
concert

the
name
of
one
of
them
said
isagani
and
i
in
the
name
of
the

added
tadeo
respect
gentlemen
more
respect
again
demanded
pecson
with
a
full
mouth
the
fourth
is
stewed
which
is
dedicated
to
the
government
and
the
country
all
turned
toward
makaraig
who
went
on
until
recently
gentlemen
the
was
believed
to
be
chinese
or
japanese
but
the
fact
is
that
being
unknown
in
china
or
japan
it
would
seem
to
be
filipino
yet
those
who
prepare
it
and
get
the
benefit
from
it
are
the
chinese
the
same
the
very
very
same
that
happens
to
the
government
and
to
the
philippines
they
seem
to
be
chinese
but
whether
they
are
or
not
the
holy
mother
has
her
doctors
all
eat
and
enjoy
it
yet
characterize
it
as
disagreeable
and
loathsome
the
same
as
with
the
country
the
same
as
with
the
government
all
live
at
its
cost
all
share
in
its
feast
and
afterwards
there
is
no
worse
country
than
the
philippines
there
is
no
government
more
imperfect
let
us
then
dedicate
the
to
the
country
and
to
the
government
agreed
many
exclaimed
i
protest
cried
isagani
respect
for
the
weaker
respect
for
the
victims
called

in
a
hollow
voice
waving
a

let
dedicate
the
to
quiroga
the
chinaman
one
of
the
four
powers
of
the
filipino
world
proposed
isagani
no
to
his
black
eminence
silence
cautioned
one
mysteriously
there
are
people
in
the
plaza
watching
us
and
walls
have
ears
true
it
was
that
curious
groups
were
standing
by
the
windows
while
the
talk
and
laughter
in
the
adjoining
houses
had
ceased
altogether
as
if
the
people
there
were
giving
their
attention
to
what
was
occurring
at
the
banquet
there
was
something
extraordinary
about
the
silence
tadeo
deliver
your
speech
makaraig
whispered
to
him
it
had
been
agreed
that
sandoval
who
possessed
the
most
oratorical
ability
should
deliver
the
last
toast
as
a
summing
up
tadeo
lazy
as
ever
had
prepared
nothing
so
he
found
himself
in
a
quandary
while
disposing
of
a
long
string
of
vermicelli
he
meditated
how
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
until
he
recalled
a
speech
learned
in
school
and
decided
to
plagiarize
it
with
adulterations
beloved
brethren
in
project
he
began
gesticulating
with
two
chinese
brute
keep
that
out
of
my
hair
cried
his
neighbor
called
by
you
to
fill
the
void
that
has
been
left
in
plagiarism
sandoval
interrupted
him
that
speech
was
delivered
by
the
president
of
our
lyceum
called
by
your
election
continued
the
imperturbable
tadeo
to
fill
the
void
that
has
been
left
in
my
mind
pointing
to
his
stomach
by
a
man
famous
for
his
christian
principles
and
for
his
inspirations
and
projects
worthy
of
some
little
remembrance
what
can
one
like
myself
say
of
him
i
who
am
very
hungry
not
having
breakfasted
have
a
neck
my
friend
called
a
neighbor
offering
that
portion
of
a
chicken
there
is
one
course
gentlemen
the
treasure
of
a
people
who
are
today
a
tale
and
a
mockery
in
the
world
wherein
have
thrust
their
hands
the
greatest
gluttons
of
the
western
regions
of
the
earth
here
he
pointed
with
his
chopsticks
to
sandoval
who
was
struggling
with
a
refractory
and
eastern
retorted
the
latter
describing
a
circle
in
the
air
with
his
spoon
in
order
to
include
all
the
banqueters
no
interruptions
i
demand
the
floor
i
demand
pickles
added
isagani
bring
on
the
stew
all
echoed
this
request
so
tadeo
sat
down
contented
with
having
got
out
of
his
quandary
the
dish
consecrated
to
padre
irene
did
not
appear
to
be
extra
good
as
sandoval
cruelly
demonstrated
thus
shining
with
grease
outside
and
with
pork
inside
bring
on
the
third
course
the
friar
pie
the
pie
was
not
yet
ready
although
the
sizzling
of
the
grease
in
the
could
be
heard
they
took
advantage
of
the
delay
to
drink
begging
pecson
to
talk
pecson
crossed
himself
gravely
and
arose
restraining
his
clownish
laugh
with
an
effort
at
the
same
time
mimicking
a
certain
augustinian
preacher
then
famous
and
beginning
in
a
murmur
as
though
he
were
reading
a
text
tripa
plena
laudal
deum
tripa
famelica
laudabit
if
the
full
stomach
praises
god
the
hungry
stomach
will
praise
the
friars
words
spoken
by
the
lord
custodio
through
the
mouth
of
in
the
journal
grito
de

the
second
article
absurdity
the
one
hundred
and
beloved
brethren
in
christ
evil
blows
its
foul
breath
over
the
verdant
shores
of
frailandia
commonly
called
the
philippine
archipelago
no
day
passes
but
the
attack
is
renewed
but
there
is
heard
some
sarcasm
against
the
reverend
venerable
infallible
corporations
defenseless
and
unsupported
allow
me
brethren
on
this
occasion
to
constitute
myself
a
to
sally
forth
in
defense
of
the
unprotected
of
the
holy
corporations
that
have
reared
us
thus
again
confirming
the
saving
idea
of
the
adage
a
full
stomach
praises
god
which
is
to
say
a
hungry
stomach
will
praise
the
friars
bravo
bravo
listen
said
isagani
seriously
i
want
you
to
understand
that
speaking
of
friars
i
respect
one
sandoval
was
getting
merry
so
he
began
to
sing
a
shady
couplet
about
the
friars
hear
me
brethren
continued
pecson
turn
your
gaze
toward
the
happy
days
of
your
infancy
endeavor
to
analyze
the
present
and
ask
yourselves
about
the
future
what
do
you
find
friars
friars
and
friars
a
friar
baptized
you
confirmed
you
visited
you
in
school
with
loving
zeal
a
friar
heard
your
first
secret
he
was
the
first
to
bring
you
into
communion
with
god
to
set
your
feet
upon
the
pathway
of
life
friars
were
your
first
and
friars
will
be
your
last
teachers
a
friar
it
is
who
opens
the
hearts
of
your
sweethearts
disposing
them
to
heed
your
sighs
a
friar
marries
you
makes
you
travel
over
different
islands
to
afford
you
changes
of
climate
and
diversion
he
will
attend
your
and
even
though
you
mount
the
scaffold
there
will
the
friar
be
to
accompany
you
with
his
prayers
and
tears
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
he
will
not
desert
you
until
he
sees
you
thoroughly
dead
nor
does
his
charity
end
there
dead
he
will
then
endeavor
to
bury
you
with
all
pomp
he
will
fight
that
your
corpse
pass
through
the
church
to
receive
his
supplications
and
he
will
only
rest
satisfied
when
he
can
deliver
you
into
the
hands
of
the
creator
purified
here
on
earth
thanks
to
temporal
punishments
tortures
and
humiliations
learned
in
the
doctrines
of
christ
who
closes
heaven
against
the
rich
they
our
redeemers
and
genuine
ministers
of
the
saviour
seek
every
means
to
lift
away
our
sins
and
bear
them
far
far
off
there
where
the
accursed
chinese
and
protestants
dwell
to
leave
us
this
air
limpid
pure
healthful
in
such
a
way
that
even
should
we
so
wish
afterwards
we
could
not
find
a
real
to
bring
about
our
condemnation
if
then
their
existence
is
necessary
to
our
happiness
if
wheresoever
we
turn
we
must
encounter
their
delicate
hands
hungering
for
kisses
that
every
day
smooth
the
marks
of
abuse
from
our
countenances
why
not
adore
them
and
fatten
them
why
demand
their
impolitic
expulsion
consider
for
a
moment
the
immense
void
that
their
absence
would
leave
in
our
social
system
tireless
workers
they
improve
and
propagate
the
races
divided
as
we
are
thanks
to
our
jealousies
and
our
susceptibilities
the
friars
unite
us
in
a
common
lot
in
a
firm
bond
so
firm
that
many
are
unable
to
move
their
elbows
take
away
the
friar
gentlemen
and
you
will
see
how
the
philippine
edifice
will
totter
lacking
robust
shoulders
and
hairy
limbs
to
sustain
it
philippine
life
will
again
become
monotonous
without
the
merry
note
of
the
playful
and
gracious
friar
without
the
booklets
and
sermons
that
split
our
sides
with
laughter
without
the
amusing
contrast
between
grand
pretensions
and
small
brains
without
the
actual
daily
representations
of
the
tales
of
boccaccio
and
la
fontaine
without
the
girdles
and
scapularies
what
would
you
have
our
women
do
in
the
future
save
that
money
and
perhaps
become
miserly
and
covetous
without
the
masses
novenaries
and
processions
where
will
you
find
games
of
to
entertain
them
in
their
hours
of
leisure
they
would
then
have
to
devote
themselves
to
their
household
duties
and
instead
of
reading
diverting
stories
of
miracles
we
should
then
have
to
get
them
works
that
are
not
extant
take
away
the
friar
and
heroism
will
disappear
the
political
virtues
will
fall
under
the
control
of
the
vulgar
take
him
away
and
the
indian
will
cease
to
exist
for
the
friar
is
the
father
the
indian
is
the
word
the
former
is
the
sculptor
the
latter
the
statue
because
all
that
we
are
think
or
do
we
owe
to
the
friar
to
his
patience
his
toil
his
perseverance
of
three
centuries
to
modify
the
form
nature
gave
us
the
philippines
without
the
friar
and
without
the
indian
what
then
would
become
of
the
unfortunate
government
in
the
hands
of
the
chinamen
it
will
eat
lobster
pie
suggested
isagani
whom
pecson
speech
bored
and
that
what
we
ought
to
be
doing
enough
of
speeches
as
the
chinese
who
should
have
served
the
courses
did
not
put
in
his
appearance
one
of
the
students
arose
and
went
to
the
rear
toward
the
balcony
that
overlooked
the
river
but
he
returned
at
once
making
mysterious
signs
we
watched

rising
it
no
use
now
when
he
saw
me
he
disappeared
approaching
the
window
he
looked
toward
the
plaza
then
made
signs
to
his
companions
to
come
nearer
they
saw
a
young
man
leave
the
door
of
the
gaze
all
about
him
then
with
some
unknown
person
enter
a
carriage
that
waited
at
the
curb
it
was
simoun
carriage
ah
exclaimed
makaraig
the
slave
of
the
attended
by
the
master
of
the
general
chapter
xxvi
pasquinades
very
early
the
next
morning
basilio
arose
to
go
to
the
hospital
he
had
his
plans
made
to
visit
his
patients
to
go
afterwards
to
the
university
to
see
about
his
licentiateship
and
then
have
an
interview
with
makaraig
about
the
expense
this
would
entail
for
he
had
used
up
the
greater
part
of
his
savings
in
ransoming
juli
and
in
securing
a
house
where
she
and
her
grandfather
might
live
and
he
had
not
dared
to
apply
to
capitan
tiago
fearing
that
such
a
move
would
be
construed
as
an
advance
on
the
legacy
so
often
promised
him
preoccupied
with
these
thoughts
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
groups
of
students
who
were
at
such
an
early
hour
returning
from
the
walled
city
as
though
the
classrooms
had
been
closed
nor
did
he
even
note
the
abstracted
air
of
some
of
them
their
whispered
conversations
or
the
mysterious
signals
exchanged
among
them
so
it
was
that
when
he
reached
san
juan
de
dios
and
his
friends
asked
him
about
the
conspiracy
he
gave
a
start
remembering
what
simoun
had
planned
but
which
had
miscarried
owing
to
the
unexplained
accident
to
the
jeweler
terrified
he
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
at
the
same
time
endeavoring
to
feign
ignorance
ah
yes
what
conspiracy
it
been
discovered
replied
one
and
it
seems
that
many
are
implicated
in
it
with
an
effort
basilio
controlled
himself
many
implicated
he
echoed
trying
to
learn
something
from
the
looks
of
the
others
who
students
a
lot
of
students
basilio
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
ask
more
fearing
that
he
would
give
himself
away
so
on
the
pretext
of
visiting
his
patients
he
left
the
group
one
of
the
clinical
professors
met
him
and
placing
his
hand
mysteriously
on
the
youth
shoulder
the
professor
was
a
friend
of
his
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
were
you
at
that
supper
last
night
in
his
excited
frame
of
mind
basilio
thought
the
professor
had
said
before
which
was
the
time
of
his
interview
with
simoun
he
tried
to
explain
i
assure
you
he
stammered
that
as
capitan
tiago
was
worse
and
besides
i
had
to
finish
that
book
you
did
well
not
to
attend
it
said
the
professor
but
you
a
member
of
the
students
association
i
pay
my
dues
well
then
a
piece
of
advice
go
home
at
once
and
destroy
any
papers
you
have
that
may
compromise
you
basilio
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
no
papers
nothing
more
than
his
clinical
notes
has
señor
simoun
simoun
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
thank
god
interrupted
the
physician
he
was
opportunely
wounded
by
some
unknown
hand
and
is
now
confined
to
his
bed
no
other
hands
are
concerned
in
this
but
hands
no
less
terrible
basilio
drew
a
breath
of
relief
simoun
was
the
only
one
who
could
compromise
him
although
he
thought
of
cabesang
tales
are
there
tulisanes
no
man
nothing
more
than
students
basilio
recovered
his
serenity
what
has
happened
then
he
made
bold
to
ask
seditious
pasquinades
have
been
found
did
you
know
about
them
where
in
the
university
nothing
more
than
that
whew
what
more
do
you
want
asked
the
professor
almost
in
a
rage
the
pasquinades
are
attributed
to
the
students
of
the
association
but
keep
quiet
the
professor
of
pathology
came
along
a
man
who
had
more
the
look
of
a
sacristan
than
of
a
physician
appointed
by
the
powerful
mandate
of
the
without
other
merit
than
unconditional
servility
to
the
corporation
he
passed
for
a
spy
and
an
informer
in
the
eyes
of
the
rest
of
the
faculty
the
first
professor
returned
his
greeting
coldly
and
winked
to
basilio
as
he
said
to
him
now
i
know
that
capitan
tiago
smells
like
a
corpse
the
crows
and
vultures
have
been
gathering
around
him
so
saying
he
went
inside
somewhat
calmed
basilio
now
ventured
to
inquire
for
more
details
but
all
that
he
could
learn
was
that
pasquinades
had
been
found
on
the
doors
of
the
university
and
that
the
had
ordered
them
to
be
taken
down
and
sent
to
the
civil
government
it
was
said
that
they
were
filled
with
threats
of
assassination
invasion
and
other
braggadocio
the
students
made
their
comments
on
the
affair
their
information
came
from
the
janitor
who
had
it
from
a
servant
in
santo
tomas
who
had
it
from
an
usher
they
prognosticated
future
suspensions
and
imprisonments
even
indicating
who
were
to
be
the
victims
naturally
the
members
of
the
association
basilio
then
recalled
simoun
words
the
day
in
which
they
can
get
rid
of
you
you
will
not
complete
your
course
could
he
have
known
anything
he
asked
himself
we
see
who
is
the
most
powerful
recovering
his
serenity
he
went
on
toward
the
university
to
learn
what
attitude
it
behooved
him
to
take
and
at
the
same
time
to
see
about
his
licentiateship
he
passed
along
calle
legazpi
then
down
through
beaterio
and
upon
arriving
at
the
corner
of
this
street
and
calle
solana
saw
that
something
important
must
indeed
have
happened
instead
of
the
former
lively
chattering
groups
on
the
sidewalks
were
to
be
seen
making
the
students
move
on
and
these
latter
issuing
from
the
university
silent
some
gloomy
some
agitated
to
stand
off
at
a
distance
or
make
their
way
home
the
first
acquaintance
he
met
was
sandoval
but
basilio
called
to
him
in
vain
he
seemed
to
have
been
smitten
deaf
effect
of
fear
on
the
juices
thought
basilio
later
he
met
tadeo
who
wore
a
christmas
face
at
last
that
eternal
holiday
seemed
to
be
realized
what
has
happened
tadeo
we
have
no
school
at
least
for
a
week
old
man
sublime
magnificent
he
rubbed
his
hands
in
glee
but
what
has
happened
they
going
to
arrest
all
of
us
in
the
association
and
are
you
glad
of
that
there
be
no
school
there
be
no
school
he
moved
away
almost
bursting
with
joy
basilio
saw
juanito
pelaez
approaching
pale
and
suspicious
this
time
his
hump
had
reached
its
maximum
so
great
was
his
haste
to
get
away
he
had
been
one
of
the
most
active
promoters
of
the
association
while
things
were
running
smoothly
eh
pelaez
what
happened
nothing
i
know
nothing
i
did
have
anything
to
do
with
it
he
responded
nervously
i
was
always
telling
you
that
these
things
were
quixotisms
it
the
truth
you
know
i
said
so
to
you
basilio
did
not
remember
whether
he
had
said
so
or
not
but
to
humor
him
replied
yes
man
but
what
happened
it
the
truth
is
it
look
you
a
witness
i
always
been
opposed
you
a
witness
do
forget
it
yes
man
but
what
going
on
listen
you
a
witness
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
members
of
the
association
except
to
give
them
advice
you
not
going
to
deny
it
now
be
careful
wo
you
no
no
i
wo
deny
it
but
for
goodness
sake
what
has
happened
but
juanito
was
already
far
away
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
guard
approaching
and
feared
arrest
basilio
then
went
on
toward
the
university
to
see
if
perhaps
the
secretary
office
might
be
open
and
if
he
could
glean
any
further
news
the
office
was
closed
but
there
was
an
extraordinary
commotion
in
the
building
hurrying
up
and
down
the
stairways
were
friars
army
officers
private
persons
old
lawyers
and
doctors
there
doubtless
to
offer
their
services
to
the
endangered
cause
at
a
distance
he
saw
his
friend
isagani
pale
and
agitated
but
radiant
with
youthful
ardor
haranguing
some
fellow
students
with
his
voice
raised
as
though
he
cared
little
that
he
be
heard
by
everybody
it
seems
preposterous
gentlemen
it
seems
unreal
that
an
incident
so
insignificant
should
scatter
us
and
send
us
into
flight
like
sparrows
at
whom
a
scarecrow
has
been
shaken
but
is
this
the
first
time
that
students
have
gone
to
prison
for
the
sake
of
liberty
where
are
those
who
have
died
those
who
have
been
shot
would
you
apostatize
now
but
who
can
the
fool
be
that
wrote
such
pasquinades
demanded
an
indignant
listener
what
does
that
matter
to
us
rejoined
isagani
we
do
have
to
find
out
let
them
find
out
before
we
know
how
they
are
drawn
up
we
have
no
need
to
make
any
show
of
agreement
at
a
time
like
this
there
where
the
danger
is
there
must
we
hasten
because
honor
is
there
if
what
the
pasquinades
say
is
compatible
with
our
dignity
and
our
feelings
be
he
who
he
may
that
wrote
them
he
has
done
well
and
we
ought
to
be
grateful
to
him
and
hasten
to
add
our
signatures
to
his
if
they
are
unworthy
of
us
our
conduct
and
our
consciences
will
in
themselves
protest
and
defend
us
from
every
accusation
upon
hearing
such
talk
basilio
although
he
liked
isagani
very
much
turned
and
left
he
had
to
go
to
makaraig
house
to
see
about
the
loan
near
the
house
of
the
wealthy
student
he
observed
whisperings
and
mysterious
signals
among
the
neighbors
but
not
comprehending
what
they
meant
continued
serenely
on
his
way
and
entered
the
doorway
two
guards
advanced
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
basilio
realized
that
he
had
made
a
bad
move
but
he
could
not
now
retreat
i
come
to
see
my
friend
makaraig
he
replied
calmly
the
guards
looked
at
each
other
wait
here
one
of
them
said
to
him
wait
till
the
corporal
comes
down
basilio
bit
his
lips
and
simoun
words
again
recurred
to
him
had
they
come
to
arrest
makaraig
was
his
thought
but
he
dared
not
give
it
utterance
he
did
not
have
to
wait
long
for
in
a
few
moments
makaraig
came
down
talking
pleasantly
with
the
corporal
the
two
were
preceded
by
a
warrant
officer
what
you
too
basilio
he
asked
i
came
to
see
you
noble
conduct
exclaimed
makaraig
laughing
in
time
of
calm
you
avoid
us
the
corporal
asked
basilio
his
name
then
scanned
a
list
medical
student
calle
anloague
he
asked
basilio
bit
his
lip
you
saved
us
a
trip
added
the
corporal
placing
his
hand
on
the
youth
shoulder
you
under
arrest
what
i
also
makaraig
burst
out
into
laughter
do
worry
friend
let
get
into
the
carriage
while
i
tell
you
about
the
supper
last
night
with
a
graceful
gesture
as
though
he
were
in
his
own
house
he
invited
the
warrant
officer
and
the
corporal
to
enter
the
carriage
that
waited
at
the
door
to
the
civil
government
he
ordered
the
cochero
now
that
basilio
had
again
regained
his
composure
he
told
makaraig
the
object
of
his
visit
the
rich
student
did
not
wait
for
him
to
finish
but
seized
his
hand
count
on
me
count
on
me
and
to
the
festivities
celebrating
our
graduation
we
invite
these
gentlemen
he
said
indicating
the
corporal
and
the
warrant
officer
chapter

the
friar
and
the
filipino
vox
populi
vox
dei
we
left
isagani
haranguing
his
friends
in
the
midst
of
his
enthusiasm
an
usher
approached
him
to
say
that
padre
fernandez
one
of
the
higher
professors
wished
to
talk
with
him
isagani
face
fell
padre
fernandez
was
a
person
greatly
respected
by
him
being
the
always
excepted
by
him
whenever
the
friars
were
attacked
what
does
padre
fernandez
want
he
inquired
the
usher
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
isagani
reluctantly
followed
him
padre
fernandez
the
friar
whom
we
met
in
los
baños
was
waiting
in
his
cell
grave
and
sad
with
his
brows
knitted
as
if
he
were
in
deep
thought
he
arose
as
isagani
entered
shook
hands
with
him
and
closed
the
door
then
he
began
to
pace
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
isagani
stood
waiting
for
him
to
speak
señor
isagani
he
began
at
length
with
some
emotion
from
the
window
i
heard
you
speaking
for
though
i
am
a
consumptive
i
have
good
ears
and
i
want
to
talk
with
you
i
have
always
liked
the
young
men
who
express
themselves
clearly
and
have
their
own
way
of
thinking
and
acting
no
matter
that
their
ideas
may
differ
from
mine
you
young
men
from
what
i
have
heard
had
a
supper
last
night
excuse
yourself
i
do
intend
to
excuse
myself
interrupted
isagani
so
much
the
better
it
shows
that
you
accept
the
consequences
of
your
actions
besides
you
would
do
ill
in
retracting
and
i
do
blame
you
i
take
no
notice
of
what
may
have
been
said
there
last
night
i
do
accuse
you
because
after
all
you
free
to
say
of
the
dominicans
what
seems
best
to
you
you
are
not
a
pupil
of
ours
only
this
year
have
we
had
the
pleasure
of
having
you
and
we
shall
probably
not
have
you
longer
do
think
that
i
going
to
invoke
considerations
of
gratitude
no
i
not
going
to
waste
my
time
in
stupid
vulgarisms
i
had
you
summoned
here
because
i
believe
that
you
are
one
of
the
few
students
who
act
from
conviction
and
as
i
like
men
of
conviction
i
going
to
explain
myself
to
señor
isagani
padre
fernandez
paused
then
continued
his
walk
with
bowed
head
his
gaze
riveted
on
the
floor
you
may
sit
down
if
you
wish
he
remarked
it
a
habit
of
mine
to
walk
about
while
talking
because
my
ideas
come
better
then
isagani
remained
standing
with
his
head
erect
waiting
for
the
professor
to
get
to
the
point
of
the
matter
for
more
than
eight
years
i
have
been
a
professor
here
resumed
padre
fernandez
still
continuing
to
pace
back
and
forth
and
in
that
time
i
known
and
dealt
with
more
than
hundred
students
i
taught
them
i
tried
to
educate
them
i
tried
to
inculcate
in
them
principles
of
justice
and
of
dignity
and
yet
in
these
days
when
there
is
so
much
murmuring
against
us
i
not
seen
one
who
has
the
temerity
to
maintain
his
accusations
when
he
finds
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
friar
not
even
aloud
in
the
presence
of
any
numbers
young
men
there
are
who
behind
our
backs
calumniate
us
and
before
us
kiss
our
hands
with
a
base
smile
begging
kind
looks
from
us
bah
what
do
you
wish
that
we
should
do
with
such
creatures
the
fault
is
not
all
theirs
padre
replied
isagani
the
fault
lies
partly
with
those
who
have
taught
them
to
be
hypocrites
with
those
who
have
tyrannized
over
freedom
of
thought
and
freedom
of
speech
here
every
independent
thought
every
word
that
is
not
an
echo
of
the
will
of
those
in
power
is
characterized
as
filibusterism
and
you
know
well
enough
what
that
means
a
fool
would
he
be
who
to
please
himself
would
say
aloud
what
he
thinks
who
would
lay
himself
liable
to
suffer
persecution
what
persecution
have
you
had
to
suffer
asked
padre
fernandez
raising
his
head
have
i
let
you
express
yourself
freely
in
my
class
nevertheless
you
are
an
exception
that
if
what
you
say
is
true
i
must
correct
so
as
to
make
the
rule
as
general
as
possible
and
thus
avoid
setting
a
bad
example
isagani
smiled
i
thank
you
but
i
will
not
discuss
with
you
whether
i
am
an
exception
i
will
accept
your
qualification
so
that
you
may
accept
mine
you
also
are
an
exception
and
as
here
we
are
not
going
to
talk
about
exceptions
nor
plead
for
ourselves
at
least
i
mean
i
beg
of
my
to
change
the
course
of
the
conversation
in
spite
of
his
liberal
principles
padre
fernandez
raised
his
head
and
stared
in
surprise
at
isagani
that
young
man
was
more
independent
than
he
had
thought
although
he
called
him
in
reality
he
was
dealing
with
him
as
an
equal
since
he
allowed
himself
to
offer
suggestions
like
a
wise
diplomat
padre
fernandez
not
only
recognized
the
fact
but
even
took
his
stand
upon
it
good
enough
he
said
but
do
look
upon
me
as
your
professor
a
friar
and
you
are
a
filipino
student
nothing
more
nor
less
now
i
ask
you
what
do
the
filipino
students
want
of
us
the
question
came
as
a
surprise
isagani
was
not
prepared
for
it
it
was
a
thrust
made
suddenly
while
they
were
preparing
their
defense
as
they
say
in
fencing
thus
startled
isagani
responded
with
a
violent
stand
like
a
beginner
defending
himself
that
you
do
your
duty
he
exclaimed
fray
fernandez
straightened
up
that
reply
sounded
to
him
like
a
that
we
do
our
duty
he
repeated
holding
himself
erect
do
we
then
do
our
duty
what
duties
do
you
ascribe
to
us
those
which
you
voluntarily
placed
upon
yourselves
on
joining
the
order
and
those
which
afterwards
once
in
it
you
have
been
willing
to
assume
but
as
a
filipino
student
i
do
think
myself
called
upon
to
examine
your
conduct
with
reference
to
your
statutes
to
catholicism
to
the
government
to
the
filipino
people
and
to
humanity
in
general
those
are
questions
that
you
have
to
settle
with
your
founders
with
the
pope
with
the
government
with
the
whole
people
and
with
god
as
a
filipino
student
i
will
confine
myself
to
your
duties
toward
us
the
friars
in
general
being
the
local
supervisors
of
education
in
the
provinces
and
the
dominicans
in
particular
by
monopolizing
in
their
hands
all
the
studies
of
the
filipino
youth
have
assumed
the
obligation
to
its
eight
millions
of
inhabitants
to
spain
and
to
humanity
of
which
we
form
a
part
of
steadily
bettering
the
young
plant
morally
and
physically
of
training
it
toward
its
happiness
of
creating
a
people
honest
prosperous
intelligent
virtuous
noble
and
loyal
now
i
ask
you
in
my
turn
have
the
friars
fulfilled
that
obligation
of
theirs
we
fulfilling
ah
padre
fernandez
interrupted
isagani
you
with
your
hand
on
heart
can
say
that
you
are
fulfilling
it
but
with
your
hand
on
the
heart
of
your
order
on
the
heart
of
all
the
orders
you
can
not
say
that
without
deceiving
yourself
ah
padre
fernandez
when
i
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
person
whom
i
esteem
and
respect
i
prefer
to
be
the
accused
rather
than
the
accuser
i
prefer
to
defend
myself
rather
than
take
the
offensive
but
now
that
we
have
entered
upon
the
discussion
let
us
carry
it
to
the
end
how
do
they
fulfill
their
obligation
those
who
look
after
education
in
the
towns
by
hindering
it
and
those
who
here
monopolize
education
those
who
try
to
mold
the
mind
of
youth
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
whomsoever
how
do
they
carry
out
their
mission
by
curtailing
knowledge
as
much
as
possible
by
extinguishing
all
ardor
and
enthusiasm
by
trampling
on
all
dignity
the
soul
only
refuge
by
inculcating
in
us
ideas
rancid
beliefs
false
principles
incompatible
with
a
life
of
progress
ah
yes
when
it
is
a
question
of
feeding
convicts
of
providing
for
the
maintenance
of
criminals
the
government
calls
for
bids
in
order
to
find
the
purveyor
who
offers
the
best
means
of
subsistence
he
who
at
least
will
not
let
them
perish
from
hunger
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
morally
feeding
a
whole
people
of
nourishing
the
intellect
of
youth
the
healthiest
part
that
which
is
later
to
be
the
country
and
the
all
the
government
not
only
does
not
ask
for
any
bid
but
restricts
the
power
to
that
very
body
which
makes
a
boast
of
not
desiring
education
of
wishing
no
advancement
what
should
we
say
if
the
purveyor
for
the
prisons
after
securing
the
contract
by
intrigue
should
then
leave
the
prisoners
to
languish
in
want
giving
them
only
what
is
stale
and
rancid
excusing
himself
afterwards
by
saying
that
it
is
not
convenient
for
the
prisoners
to
enjoy
good
health
because
good
health
brings
merry
thoughts
because
merriment
improves
the
man
and
the
man
ought
not
to
be
improved
because
it
is
to
the
interest
that
there
be
many
criminals
what
should
we
say
if
afterwards
the
government
and
the
purveyor
should
agree
between
themselves
that
of
the
ten
or
twelve
cuartos
which
one
received
for
each
criminal
the
other
should
receive
five
padre
fernandek
bit
his
lip
those
are
grave
charges
he
said
and
you
are
overstepping
the
limits
of
our
agreement
no
padre
not
if
i
continue
to
deal
with
the
student
question
the
friars
and
i
do
not
say
you
friars
since
i
do
not
confuse
you
with
the
common
herd
the
friars
of
all
the
orders
have
constituted
themselves
our
mental
purveyors
yet
they
say
and
shamelessly
proclaim
that
it
is
not
expedient
for
us
to
become
enlightened
because
some
day
we
shall
declare
ourselves
free
that
is
just
the
same
as
not
wishing
the
prisoner
to
be
so
that
he
may
improve
and
get
out
of
prison
liberty
is
to
man
what
education
is
to
the
intelligence
and
the
friars
unwillingness
that
we
have
it
is
the
origin
of
our
discontent
instruction
is
given
only
to
those
who
deserve
it
rejoined
padre
fernandez
dryly
to
give
it
to
men
without
character
and
without
morality
is
to
prostitute
it
why
are
there
men
without
character
and
without
morality
the
dominican
shrugged
his
shoulders
defects
that
they
imbibe
with
their
mothers
milk
that
they
breathe
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
how
do
i
know
ah
no
padre
fernandez
exclaimed
the
young
man
impetuously
you
have
not
dared
to
go
into
the
subject
deeply
you
have
not
wished
to
gaze
into
the
depths
from
fear
of
finding
yourself
there
in
the
darkness
of
your
brethren
what
we
are
you
have
made
us
a
people
tyrannized
over
is
forced
to
be
hypocritical
a
people
denied
the
truth
must
resort
to
lies
and
he
who
makes
himself
a
tyrant
breeds
slaves
there
is
no
morality
you
say
so
let
it
be
even
though
statistics
can
refute
you
in
that
here
are
not
committed
crimes
like
those
among
other
peoples
blinded
by
the
fumes
of
their
moralizers
but
without
attempting
now
to
analyze
what
it
is
that
forms
the
character
and
how
far
the
education
received
determines
morality
i
will
agree
with
you
that
we
are
defective
who
is
to
blame
for
that
you
who
for
three
centuries
and
a
half
have
had
in
your
hands
our
education
or
we
who
submit
to
everything
if
after
three
centuries
and
a
half
the
artist
has
been
able
to
produce
only
a
caricature
stupid
indeed
he
must
be
or
bad
enough
the
material
he
works
upon
stupider
still
then
when
knowing
it
to
be
bad
he
does
not
give
it
up
but
goes
on
wasting
time
not
only
is
he
stupid
but
he
is
a
cheat
and
a
robber
because
he
knows
that
his
work
is
useless
yet
continues
to
draw
his
salary
not
only
is
he
stupid
and
a
thief
he
is
a
villain
in
that
he
prevents
any
other
workman
from
trying
his
skill
to
see
if
he
might
not
produce
something
worth
while
the
deadly
jealousy
of
the
incompetent
the
reply
was
sharp
and
padre
fernandez
felt
himself
caught
to
his
gaze
isagani
appeared
gigantic
invincible
convincing
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
beaten
by
a
filipino
student
he
repented
of
having
provoked
the
argument
but
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
in
this
quandary
finding
himself
confronted
with
such
a
formidable
adversary
he
sought
a
strong
shield
and
laid
hold
of
the
government
you
impute
all
the
faults
to
us
because
you
see
only
us
who
are
near
he
said
in
a
less
haughty
tone
it
natural
and
surprise
me
a
person
hates
the
soldier
or
policeman
who
arrests
him
and
not
the
judge
who
sends
him
to
prison
you
and
we
are
both
dancing
to
the
same
measure
of
music
if
at
the
same
note
you
lift
your
foot
in
unison
with
us
do
blame
us
for
it
it
the
music
that
is
directing
our
movements
do
you
think
that
we
friars
have
no
consciences
and
that
we
do
not
desire
what
is
right
do
you
believe
that
we
do
not
think
about
you
that
we
do
not
heed
our
duty
that
we
only
eat
to
live
and
live
to
rule
would
that
it
were
so
but
we
like
you
follow
the
cadence
finding
ourselves
between
scylla
and
charybdis
either
you
reject
us
or
the
government
rejects
us
the
government
commands
and
he
who
commands
commands
and
must
be
obeyed
from
which
it
may
be
inferred
remarked
isagani
with
a
bitter
smile
that
the
government
wishes
our
demoralization
oh
no
i
did
mean
that
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
there
are
beliefs
there
are
theories
there
are
laws
which
dictated
with
the
best
intention
produce
the
most
deplorable
consequences
explain
myself
better
by
citing
an
example
to
stamp
out
a
small
evil
there
are
dictated
many
laws
that
cause
greater
evils
still
in
republica
plurimae
leges
said
tacitus
to
prevent
one
case
of
fraud
there
are
provided
a
million
and
a
half
preventive
or
humiliating
regulations
which
produce
the
immediate
effect
of
awakening
in
the
public
the
desire
to
elude
and
mock
such
regulations
to
make
a
people
criminal
there
nothing
more
needed
than
to
doubt
its
virtue
enact
a
law
not
only
here
but
even
in
spain
and
you
will
see
how
the
means
of
evading
it
will
be
sought
and
this
is
for
the
very
reason
that
the
legislators
have
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
more
an
object
is
hidden
the
more
a
sight
of
it
is
desired
why
are
rascality
and
astuteness
regarded
as
great
qualities
in
the
spanish
people
when
there
is
no
other
so
noble
so
proud
so
chivalrous
as
it
because
our
legislators
with
the
best
intentions
have
doubted
its
nobility
wounded
its
pride
challenged
its
chivalry
do
you
wish
to
open
in
spain
a
road
among
the
rocks
then
place
there
an
imperative
notice
forbidding
the
passage
and
the
people
in
order
to
protest
against
the
order
will
leave
the
highway
to
clamber
over
the
rocks
the
day
on
which
some
legislator
in
spain
forbids
virtue
and
commands
vice
then
all
will
become
virtuous
the
dominican
paused
for
a
brief
space
then
resumed
but
you
may
say
that
we
are
getting
away
from
the
subject
so
i
return
to
it
what
i
can
say
to
you
to
convince
you
is
that
the
vices
from
which
you
suffer
ought
to
be
ascribed
by
you
neither
to
us
nor
to
the
government
they
are
due
to
the
imperfect
organization
of
our
social
system
multum
probat
nihil
one
loses
himself
through
excessive
caution
lacking
what
is
necessary
and
having
too
much
of
what
is
superfluous
if
you
admit
those
defects
in
your
social
system
replied
isagani
why
then
do
you
undertake
to
regulate
alien
societies
instead
of
first
devoting
your
attention
to
yourselves
we
getting
away
from
the
subject
young
man
the
theory
in
accomplished
facts
must
be
accepted
so
let
it
be
i
accept
it
because
it
is
an
accomplished
fact
but
i
will
further
ask
why
if
your
social
organization
is
defective
do
you
not
change
it
or
at
least
give
heed
to
the
cry
of
those
who
are
injured
by
it
we
still
far
away
let
talk
about
what
the
students
want
from
the
friars
from
the
moment
when
the
friars
hide
themselves
behind
the
government
the
students
have
to
turn
to
it
this
statement
was
true
and
there
appeared
no
means
of
ignoring
it
i
not
the
government
and
i
ca
answer
for
its
acts
what
do
the
students
wish
us
to
do
for
them
within
the
limits
by
which
we
are
confined
not
to
oppose
the
emancipation
of
education
but
to
favor
it
the
dominican
shook
his
head
without
stating
my
own
opinion
that
is
asking
us
to
commit
suicide
he
said
on
the
contrary
it
is
asking
you
for
room
to
pass
in
order
not
to
trample
upon
and
crush
you
ahem
coughed
padre
fernandez
stopping
and
remaining
thoughtful
begin
by
asking
something
that
does
not
cost
so
much
something
that
any
one
of
us
can
grant
without
abatement
of
dignity
or
privilege
for
if
we
can
reach
an
understanding
and
dwell
in
peace
why
this
hatred
why
this
distrust
then
let
get
down
to
details
yes
because
if
we
disturb
the
foundation
we
bring
down
the
whole
edifice
then
let
get
down
to
details
let
leave
the
region
of
abstract
principles
rejoined
isagani
with
a
smile
and
without
stating
my
own
opinion
the
youth
accented
these
words
the
students
would
desist
from
their
attitude
and
soften
certain
asperities
if
the
professors
would
try
to
treat
them
better
than
they
have
up
to
the
present
that
is
in
their
hands
what
demanded
the
dominican
have
the
students
any
complaint
to
make
about
my
conduct
padre
we
agreed
from
the
start
not
to
talk
of
yourself
or
of
myself
we
speaking
generally
the
students
besides
getting
no
great
benefit
out
of
the
years
spent
in
the
classes
often
leave
there
remnants
of
their
dignity
if
not
the
whole
of
it
padre
fernandez
again
bit
his
lip
no
one
forces
them
to
study
the
fields
are
uncultivated
he
observed
dryly
yes
there
is
something
that
impels
them
to
study
replied
isagani
in
the
same
tone
looking
the
dominican
full
in
the
face
besides
the
duty
of
every
one
to
seek
his
own
perfection
there
is
the
desire
innate
in
man
to
cultivate
his
intellect
a
desire
the
more
powerful
here
in
that
it
is
repressed
he
who
gives
his
gold
and
his
life
to
the
state
has
the
right
to
require
of
it
opporttmity
better
to
get
that
gold
and
better
to
care
for
his
life
yes
padre
there
is
something
that
impels
them
and
that
something
is
the
government
itself
it
is
you
yourselves
who
pitilessly
ridicule
the
uncultured
indian
and
deny
him
his
rights
on
the
ground
that
he
is
ignorant
you
strip
him
and
then
scoff
at
his
nakedness
padre
fernandez
did
not
reply
but
continued
to
pace
about
feverishly
as
though
very
much
agitated
you
say
that
the
fields
are
not
cultivated
resumed
isagani
in
a
changed
tone
after
a
brief
pause
let
not
enter
upon
an
analysis
of
the
reason
for
this
because
we
should
get
far
away
but
you
padre
fernandez
you
a
teacher
you
a
learned
man
do
you
wish
a
people
of
peons
and
laborers
in
your
opinion
is
the
laborer
the
perfect
state
at
which
man
may
arrive
in
his
development
or
is
it
that
you
wish
knowledge
for
yourself
and
labor
for
the
rest
no
i
want
knowledge
for
him
who
deserves
it
for
him
who
knows
how
to
use
it
was
the
reply
when
the
students
demonstrate
that
they
love
it
when
young
men
of
conviction
appear
young
men
who
know
how
to
maintain
their
dignity
and
make
it
respected
then
there
will
be
knowledge
then
there
will
be
considerate
professors
if
there
are
now
professors
who
resort
to
abuse
it
is
because
there
are
pupils
who
submit
to
it
when
there
are
professors
there
will
be
students
begin
by
reforming
yourselves
you
who
have
need
of
change
and
we
will
follow
yes
said
isagani
with
a
bitter
laugh
let
us
begin
it
because
the
difficulty
is
on
our
side
well
you
know
what
is
expected
of
a
pupil
who
stands
before
a
professor
you
yourself
with
all
your
love
of
justice
with
all
your
kind
sentiments
have
been
restraining
yourself
by
a
great
effort
while
i
have
been
telling
you
bitter
truths
you
yourself
padre
fernandez
what
good
has
been
secured
by
him
among
us
who
has
tried
to
inculcate
other

what
evils
have
not
fallen
upon
you
because
you
have
tried
to
be
just
and
perform
your
duty
señor
isagani
said
the
dominican
extending
his
hand
although
it
may
seem
that
nothing
practical
has
resulted
from
this
conversation
yet
something
has
been
gained
i
talk
to
my
brethren
about
what
you
have
told
me
and
i
hope
that
something
can
be
done
only
i
fear
that
they
wo
believe
in
your
existence
i
fear
the
same
returned
isagani
shaking
the
dominican
hand
i
fear
that
my
friends
will
not
believe
in
your
existence
as
you
have
revealed
yourself
to
me
today
considering
the
interview
at
an
end
the
young
man
took
his
leave
padre
fernandez
opened
the
door
and
followed
him
with
his
gaze
until
he
disappeared
around
a
corner
in
the
corridor
for
some
time
he
listened
to
the
retreating
footsteps
then
went
back
into
his
cell
and
waited
for
the
youth
to
appear
in
the
street
he
saw
him
and
actually
heard
him
say
to
a
friend
who
asked
where
he
was
going
to
the
civil
government
i
going
to
see
the
pasquinades
and
join
the
others
his
startled
friend
stared
at
him
as
one
would
look
at
a
person
who
is
about
to
commit
suicide
then
moved
away
from
him
hurriedly
poor
boy
murmured
padre
fernandez
feeling
his
eyes
moisten
i
grudge
you
to
the
jesuits
who
educated
you
but
padre
fernandez
was
completely
mistaken
the
jesuits
repudiated
isagani
when
that
afternoon
they
learned
that
he
had
been
arrested
saying
that
he
would
compromise
them
that
young
man
has
thrown
himself
away
he
going
to
do
us
harm
let
it
be
understood
that
he
did
get
those
ideas
here
nor
were
the
jesuits
wrong
no
those
ideas
come
only
from
god
through
the
medium
of
nature
chapter

tatakut
with
prophetic
inspiration
had
been
for
some
days
past
maintaining
in
his
newspaper
that
education
was
disastrous
very
disastrous
for
the
philippine
islands
and
now
in
view
of
the
events
of
that
friday
of
pasquinades
the
writer
crowed
and
chanted
his
triumph
leaving
belittled
and
overwhelmed
his
adversary
who
in
the
had
dared
to
ridicule
him
in
the
following
manner
from
our
contemporary
education
is
disastrous
very
disastrous
for
the
philippine
islands
admitted
for
some
time
has
pretended
to
represent
the
filipino
people
as
fray
ibañez
would
say
if
he
knew
latin
but
fray
ibañez
turns
mussulman
when
he
writes
and
we
know
how
the
mussulmans
dealt
with
education
witness
as
a
royal
preacher
said
the
alexandrian
library
now
he
was
right
he
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
islands
who
thought
the
only
one
who
foresaw
events
truly
the
news
that
seditious
pasquinades
had
been
found
on
the
doors
of
the
university
not
only
took
away
the
appetite
from
many
and
disturbed
the
digestion
of
others
but
it
even
rendered
the
phlegmatic
chinese
uneasy
so
that
they
no
longer
dared
to
sit
in
their
shops
with
one
leg
drawn
up
as
usual
from
fear
of
losing
time
in
extending
it
in
order
to
put
themselves
into
flight
at
eight
in
the
morning
although
the
sun
continued
on
its
course
and
his
excellency
the
did
not
appear
at
the
head
of
his
victorious
cohorts
still
the
excitement
had
increased
the
friars
who
were
accustomed
to
frequent
quiroga
bazaar
did
not
put
in
their
appearance
and
this
symptom
presaged
terrific
cataclysms
if
the
sun
had
risen
a
square
and
the
saints
appeared
only
in
pantaloons
quiroga
would
not
have
been
so
greatly
alarmed
for
he
would
have
taken
the
sun
for
a
and
the
sacred
images
for
gamblers
who
had
lost
their
camisas
but
for
the
friars
not
to
come
precisely
when
some
novelties
had
just
arrived
for
them
by
means
of
a
provincial
friend
of
his
quiroga
forbade
entrance
into
his
to
every
indian
who
was
not
an
old
acquaintance
as
the
future
chinese
consul
feared
that
they
might
get
possession
of
the
sums
that
the
wretches
lost
there
after
arranging
his
bazaar
in
such
a
way
that
he
could
close
it
quickly
in
case
of
need
he
had
a
policeman
accompany
him
for
the
short
distance
that
separated
his
house
from
simoun
quiroga
thought
this
occasion
the
most
propitious
for
making
use
of
the
rifles
and
cartridges
that
he
had
in
his
warehouse
in
the
way
the
jeweler
had
pointed
out
so
that
on
the
following
days
there
would
be
searches
made
and
then
how
many
prisoners
how
many
terrified
people
would
give
up
their
savings
it
was
the
game
of
the
old
carbineers
in
slipping
contraband
cigars
and
under
a
house
in
order
to
pretend
a
search
and
force
the
unfortunate
owner
to
bribery
or
fines
only
now
the
art
had
been
perfected
and
the
tobacco
monopoly
abolished
resort
was
had
to
the
prohibited
arms
but
simoun
refused
to
see
any
one
and
sent
word
to
the
chinese
that
he
should
leave
things
as
they
were
whereupon
he
went
to
see
don
custodio
to
inquire
whether
he
should
fortify
his
bazaar
but
neither
would
don
custodio
receive
him
being
at
the
time
engaged
in
the
study
of
a
project
for
defense
in
case
of
a
siege
he
thought
of
as
a
source
of
information
but
finding
the
writer
armed
to
the
teeth
and
using
two
loaded
revolvers
for
took
his
leave
in
the
shortest
possible
time
to
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
take
to
his
bed
under
pretense
of
illness
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
talk
was
no
longer
of
simple
pasquinades
there
were
whispered
rumors
of
an
understanding
between
the
students
and
the
outlaws
of
san
mateo
it
was
certain
that
in
the
they
had
conspired
to
surprise
the
city
there
was
talk
of
german
ships
outside
the
bay
to
support
the
movement
of
a
band
of
young
men
who
under
the
pretext
of
protesting
and
demonstrating
their
hispanism
had
gone
to
the
palace
to
place
themselves
at
the
general
orders
but
had
been
arrested
because
it
was
discovered
that
they
were
armed
providence
had
saved
his
excellency
preventing
him
from
receiving
those
precocious
criminals
as
he
was
at
the
time
in
conference
with
the
provincials
the
and
with
padre
irene
padre
salvi
representative
there
was
considerable
truth
in
these
rumors
if
we
have
to
believe
padre
irene
who
in
the
afternoon
went
to
visit
capitan
tiago
according
to
him
certain
persons
had
advised
his
excellency
to
improve
the
opportunity
in
order
to
inspire
terror
and
administer
a
lasting
lesson
to
the
filibusters
a
number
shot
one
had
advised
some
two
dozen
reformers
deported
at
once
in
the
silence
of
the
night
would
extinguish
forever
the
flames
of
discontent
no
rejoined
another
who
had
a
kind
heart
sufficient
that
the
soldiers
parade
through
the
streets
a
troop
of
cavalry
for
example
with
drawn
sabers
sufficient
to
drag
along
some
cannon
enough
the
people
are
timid
and
will
all
retire
into
their
houses
no
no
insinuated
another
this
is
the
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
the
enemy
it
not
sufficient
that
they
retire
into
their
houses
they
should
be
made
to
come
out
like
evil
humors
by
means
of
plasters
if
they
are
inclined
to
start
riots
they
should
be
stirred
up
by
secret
agitators
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
troops
should
be
resting
on
their
arms
and
appearing
careless
and
indifferent
so
the
people
may
be
emboldened
and
then
in
case
of
any
disturbance
out
on
them
action
the
end
justifies
the
means
remarked
another
our
end
is
our
holy
religion
and
the
integrity
of
the
fatherland
proclaim
a
state
of
siege
and
in
case
of
the
least
disturbance
arrest
all
the
rich
and
educated
and
clean
up
the
country
if
i
had
got
there
in
time
to
counsel
moderation
added
padre
irene
speaking
to
capitan
tiago
it
certain
that
blood
would
now
be
flowing
through
the
streets
i
thought
of
you
capitan
the
partizans
of
force
could
do
much
with
the
general
and
they
missed
simoun
ah
if
simoun
had
not
been
taken
ill
with
the
arrest
of
basilio
and
the
search
made
later
among
his
books
and
papers
capitan
tiago
had
become
much
worse
now
padre
irene
had
come
to
augment
his
terror
with
tales
ineffable
fear
seized
upon
the
wretch
manifesting
itself
first
by
a
light
shiver
which
was
rapidly
accentuated
until
he
was
unable
to
speak
with
his
eyes
bulging
and
his
brow
covered
with
sweat
he
caught
padre
arm
and
tried
to
rise
but
could
not
and
then
uttering
two
groans
fell
heavily
back
upon
the
pillow
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
he
was
slavering
but
he
was
dead
the
terrified
padre
irene
fled
and
as
the
dying
man
had
caught
hold
of
him
in
his
flight
he
dragged
the
corpse
from
the
bed
leaving
it
sprawling
in
the
middle
of
the
room
by
night
the
terror
had
reached
a
climax
several
incidents
had
occurred
to
make
the
timorous
believe
in
the
presence
of
secret
agitators
during
a
baptism
some
cuartos
were
thrown
to
the
boys
and
naturally
there
was
a
scramble
at
the
door
of
the
church
it
happened
that
at
the
time
there
was
passing
a
bold
soldier
who
somewhat
preoccupied
mistook
the
uproar
for
a
gathering
of
filibusters
and
hurled
himself
sword
in
hand
upon
the
boys
he
went
into
the
church
and
had
he
not
become
entangled
in
the
curtains
suspended
from
the
choir
he
would
not
have
left
a
single
head
on
shoulders
it
was
but
the
matter
of
a
moment
for
the
timorous
to
witness
this
and
take
to
flight
spreading
the
news
that
the
revolution
had
begun
the
few
shops
that
had
been
kept
open
were
now
hastily
closed
there
being
chinese
who
even
left
bolts
of
cloth
outside
and
not
a
few
women
lost
their
slippers
in
their
flight
through
the
streets
fortunately
there
was
only
one
person
wounded
and
a
few
bruised
among
them
the
soldier
himself
who
suffered
a
fall
fighting
with
the
curtain
which
smelt
to
him
of
filibusterism
such
prowess
gained
him
great
renown
and
a
renown
so
pure
that
it
is
to
be
wished
all
fame
could
be
acquired
in
like
manner
mothers
would
then
weep
less
and
earth
would
be
more
populous
in
a
suburb
the
inhabitants
caught
two
unknown
individuals
burying
arms
under
a
house
whereupon
a
tumult
arose
and
the
people
pursued
the
strangers
in
order
to
kill
them
and
turn
their
bodies
over
to
the
authorities
but
some
one
pacified
the
excited
crowd
by
telling
them
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
hand
over
the
which
proved
to
be
some
old
shotguns
that
would
surely
have
killed
the
first
person
who
tried
to
fire
them
all
right
exclaimed
one
braggart
if
they
want
us
to
rebel
let
go
ahead
but
he
was
cuffed
and
kicked
into
silence
the
women
pinching
him
as
though
he
had
been
the
owner
of
the
shotguns
in
ermita
the
affair
was
more
serious
even
though
there
was
less
excitement
and
that
when
there
were
shots
fired
a
certain
cautious
government
employee
armed
to
the
teeth
saw
at
nightfall
an
object
near
his
house
and
taking
it
for
nothing
less
than
a
student
fired
at
it
twice
with
a
revolver
the
object
proved
to
be
a
policeman
and
they
buried
him
christi
mutis
in
dulumbayan
various
shots
also
resounded
from
which
there
resulted
the
death
of
a
poor
old
deaf
man
who
had
not
heard
the
and
of
a
hog
that
had
heard
it
and
had
not
answered
the
old
man
was
buried
with
difficulty
since
there
was
no
money
to
pay
for
the
obsequies
but
the
hog
was
eaten
in
manila
in
a
confectionery
near
the
university
much
frequented
by
the
students
the
arrests
were
thus
commented
upon
and
have
they
arrested
tadeo
asked
the
proprietess
answered
a
student
who
lived
in
parian
he
already
shot
shot
he
has
paid
what
he
owes
me
ay
do
mention
that
or
you
be
taken
for
an
accomplice
already
burnt
the
book
you
lent
me
there
might
be
a
search
and
it
would
be
found
be
careful
did
you
say
that
isagani
is
a
prisoner
crazy
fool
too
that
isagani
replied
the
indignant
student
they
did
try
to
catch
him
but
he
went
and
surrendered
let
him
bust
himself
he
surely
be
shot
the
señora
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
does
owe
me
anything
and
what
about
paulita
she
wo
lack
a
husband
sure
she
cry
a
little
and
then
marry
a
spaniard
the
night
was
one
of
the
gloomiest
in
the
houses
the
rosary
was
recited
and
pious
women
dedicated
paternosters
and
requiems
to
each
of
the
souls
of
their
relatives
and
friends
by
eight
hardly
a
pedestrian
could
be
seen
only
from
time
to
time
was
heard
the
galloping
of
a
horse
against
whose
sides
a
saber
clanked
noisily
then
the
whistles
of
the
watchmen
and
carriages
that
whirled
along
at
full
speed
as
though
pursued
by
mobs
of
filibusters
yet
terror
did
not
reign
everywhere
in
the
house
of
the
silversmith
where
placido
penitente
boarded
the
events
were
commented
upon
and
discussed
with
some
freedom
i
do
believe
in
the
pasquinades
declared
a
workman
lank
and
withered
from
operating
the
blowpipe
to
me
it
looks
like
padre
salvi
doings
ahem
ahem
coughed
the
silversmith
a
very
prudent
man
who
did
not
dare
to
stop
the
conversation
from
fear
that
he
would
be
considered
a
coward
the
good
man
had
to
content
himself
with
coughing
winking
to
his
helper
and
gazing
toward
the
street
as
if
to
say
they
may
be
watching
us
on
account
of
the
operetta
added
another
workman
aha
exclaimed
one
who
had
a
foolish
face
i
told
you
so
ahem
rejoined
a
clerk
in
a
tone
of
compassion
the
affair
of
the
pasquinades
is
true
chichoy
and
i
can
give
you
the
explanation
then
he
added
mysteriously
it
a
trick
of
the
chinaman
quiroga
ahem
ahem
again
coughed
the
silversmith
shifting
his
quid
of
buyo
from
one
cheek
to
the
other
believe
me
chichoy
of
quiroga
the
chinaman
i
heard
it
in
the
office
it
certain
then
exclaimed
the
simpleton
believing
it
at
once
quiroga
explained
the
clerk
has
a
hundred
thousand
pesos
in
mexican
silver
out
in
the
bay
how
is
he
to
get
it
in
very
easily
fix
up
the
pasquinades
availing
himself
of
the
question
of
the
students
and
while
is
excited
grease
the
officials
palms
and
in
the
cases
come
just
it
just
it
cried
the
credulous
fool
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
just
it
that
why
quiroga
did
it
that
why
but
he
had
to
relapse
into
silence
as
he
really
did
not
know
what
to
say
about
quiroga
and
we
must
pay
the
damages
asked
the
indignant
chichoy
ahem
ahem
coughed
the
silversmith
hearing
steps
in
the
street
the
footsteps
approached
and
all
in
the
shop
fell
silent
pascual
bailon
is
a
great
saint
declared
the
silversmith
hypocritically
in
a
loud
voice
at
the
same
time
winking
to
the
others
pascual
bailon
at
that
moment
there
appeared
the
face
of
placido
penitente
who
was
accompanied
by
the
pyrotechnician
that
we
saw
receiving
orders
from
simoun
the
newcomers
were
surrounded
and
importuned
for
news
i
have
been
able
to
talk
with
the
prisoners
explained
placido
there
are
some
thirty
of
them

on
your
guard
cautioned
the
pyrotechnician
exchanging
a
knowing
look
with
placido
they
say
that
there
going
to
be
a
massacre
aha
thunder
exclaimed
chichoy
looking
about
for
a
weapon
seeing
none
he
caught
up
his
blowpipe
the
silversmith
sat
down
trembling
in
every
limb
the
credulous
simpleton
already
saw
himself
beheaded
and
wept
in
anticipation
over
the
fate
of
his
family
no
contradicted
the
clerk
there
not
going
to
be
any
massacre
the
adviser
of
he
made
a
mysterious
gesture
is
fortunately
sick
simoun
ahem
ahem
placido
and
the
pyrotechnician
exchanged
another
look
if
he
had
got
sick
it
would
look
like

what

the

the

chichoy

have
been
saying
terrible

to

from
his
murderous

with
the

the

playing

he

the

was
attacked
by
another

so
severe
that

finally
asked
all
to

the

us
to

another
fit
of
coughing
on
the
part

prevented
further

the

retired
to
their
homes

with

hammers
and

other
implements

in

voice

the

in

stroll
to

the
corpse
of
a

was
horrified
but
after
touching
it
with
his
cane
and
gazing
toward
the
gates
proceeded
on
his
way
musing
over
a
sentimental
tale
he
might
base
upon
the
incident
however
no
allusion
to
it
appeared
in

capitan
tiago
had
a
good
end
that
is
a
quite
exceptional
funeral
true
it
is
that
the
curate
of
the
parish
had
ventured
the
observation
to
padre
irene
that
capitan
tiago
had
died
without
confession
but
the
good
priest
smiling
sardonically
had
rubbed
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
answered
why
say
that
to
me
if
we
had
to
deny
the
obsequies
to
all
who
die
without
confession
we
should
forget
the
these
restrictions
as
you
well
know
are
enforced
when
the
impenitent
is
also
insolvent
but
capitan
tiago
out
on
you
you
buried
infidel
chinamen
and
with
a
requiem
mass
capitan
tiago
had
named
padre
irene
as
his
executor
and
willed
his
property
in
part
to
clara
part
to
the
pope
to
the
archbishop
the
religious
corporations
leaving
twenty
pesos
for
the
matriculation
of
poor
students
this
last
clause
had
been
dictated
at
the
suggestion
of
padre
irene
in
his
capacity
as
protector
of
studious
youths
capitan
tiago
had
annulled
a
legacy
of
pesos
that
he
had
left
to
basilio
in
view
of
the
ungrateful
conduct
of
the
boy
during
the
last
few
days
but
padre
irene
had
restored
it
and
announced
that
he
would
take
it
upon
his
own
purse
and
conscience
in
the
dead
man
house
where
were
assembled
on
the
following
day
many
old
friends
and
acquaintances
considerable
comment
was
indulged
in
over
a
miracle
it
was
reported
that
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
dying
the
soul
of
capitan
tiago
had
appeared
to
the
nuns
surrounded
by
a
brilliant
light
god
had
saved
him
thanks
to
the
pious
legacies
and
to
the
numerous
masses
he
had
paid
for
the
story
was
commented
upon
it
was
recounted
vividly
it
took
on
particulars
and
was
doubted
by
no
one
the
appearance
of
capitan
tiago
was
minutely
described
of
course
the
frock
coat
the
cheek
bulged
out
by
the
quid
of
buyo
without
omitting
the
and
the
the
senior
sacristan
who
was
present
gravely
affirmed
these
facts
with
his
head
and
reflected
that
after
death
he
would
appear
with
his
cup
of
white
for
without
that
refreshing
breakfast
he
could
not
comprehend
happiness
either
on
earth
or
in
heaven
on
this
subject
because
of
their
inability
to
discuss
the
events
of
the
preceding
day
and
because
there
were
gamblers
present
many
strange
speculations
were
developed
they
made
conjectures
as
to
whether
capitan
tiago
would
invite
peter
to
a
whether
they
would
place
bets
whether
the
were
immortal
whether
invulnerable
and
in
this
case
who
would
be
the
referee
who
would
win
and
so
on
discussions
quite
to
the
taste
of
those
who
found
sciences
theories
and
systems
based
on
a
text
which
they
esteem
infallible
revealed
or
dogmatic
moreover
there
were
cited
passages
from
novenas
books
of
miracles
sayings
of
the
curates
descriptions
of
heaven
and
other
embroidery
don
primitivo
the
philosopher
was
in
his
glory
quoting
opinions
of
the
theologians
because
no
one
can
lose
he
stated
with
great
authority
to
lose
would
cause
hard
feelings
and
in
heaven
there
ca
be
any
hard
feelings
but
some
one
has
to
win
rejoined
the
gambler
aristorenas
the
fun
lies
in
winning
well
both
win
that
easy
this
idea
of
both
winning
could
not
be
admitted
by
aristorenas
for
he
had
passed
his
life
in
the
cockpit
and
had
always
seen
one
cock
lose
and
the
other
win
at
best
there
was
a
tie
vainly
don
primitivo
argued
in
latin
aristorenas
shook
his
head
and
that
too
when
don
primitivo
latin
was
easy
to
understand
for
he
talked
of

talisainus
acuto

an
gallus

petri
bulikus
sasabungus
and
so
on
until
at
length
he
decided
to
resort
to
the
argument
which
many
use
to
convince
and
silence
their
opponents

martin

shrank
away
pale
and
trembling
while
quiroga
who
had
listened
with
great
attention
to
the
argument
with
marked
deference
offered
the
philosopher
a
magnificent
cigar
at
the
same
time
asking
in
his
caressing
voice
surely
one
can
make

among
the
others
they
talked
more
of
the
deceased
at
least
they
discussed
what
kind
of
clothing
to
put
on
him
capitan
tinong
proposed
a
franciscan
habit
and
fortunately
he
had
one
old
threadbare
and
patched
a
precious
object
which
according
to
the
friar
who
gave
it
to
him
as
alms
in
exchange
for
pesos
would
preserve
the
corpse
from
the
flames
of
hell
and
which
reckoned
in
its
support
various
pious
anecdotes
taken
from
the
books
distributed
by
the
curates
although
he
held
this
relic
in
great
esteem
capitan
tinong
was
disposed
to
part
with
it
for
the
sake
of
his
intimate
friend
whom
he
had
not
been
able
to
visit
during
his
illness
but
a
tailor
objected
with
good
reason
that
since
the
nuns
had
seen
capitan
tiago
ascending
to
heaven
in
a
frock
coat
in
a
frock
coat
he
should
be
dressed
here
on
earth
nor
was
there
any
necessity
for
preservatives
and
garments
the
deceased
had
attended
balls
and
fiestas
in
a
frock
coat
and
nothing
else
would
be
expected
of
him
in
the
skies
and
wonderful
to
relate
the
tailor
accidentally
happened
to
have
one
ready
which
he
would
part
with
for
pesos
four
cheaper
than
the
franciscan
habit
because
he
did
want
to
make
any
profit
on
capitan
tiago
who
had
been
his
customer
in
life
and
would
now
be
his
patron
in
heaven
but
padre
irene
trustee
and
executor
rejected
both
proposals
and
ordered
that
the
capitan
be
dressed
in
one
of
his
old
suits
of
clothes
remarking
with
holy
unction
that
god
paid
no
attention
to
clothing
the
obsequies
were
therefore
of
the
very
first
class
there
were
responsories
in
the
house
and
in
the
street
three
friars
officiated
as
though
one
were
not
sufficient
for
such
a
great
soul
all
the
rites
and
ceremonies
possible
were
performed
and
it
is
reported
that
there
were
even
as
in
the
benefits
for
actors
it
was
indeed
a
delight
loads
of
incense
were
burned
there
were
plenty
of
latin
chants
large
quantities
of
holy
water
were
expended
and
padre
irene
out
of
regard
for
his
old
friend
sang
the
in
a
falsetto
voice
from
the
choir
while
the
neighbors
suffered
real
headaches
from
so
much
doña
patrocinio
the
ancient
rival
of
capitan
tiago
in
religiosity
actually
wanted
to
die
on
the
next
day
so
that
she
might
order
even
more
sumptuous
obsequies
the
pious
old
lady
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
he
whom
she
had
long
considered
vanquished
forever
should
in
dying
come
forward
again
with
so
much
pomp
yes
she
desired
to
die
and
it
seemed
that
she
could
hear
the
exclamations
of
the
people
at
the
funeral
this
indeed
is
what
you
call
a
funeral
this
indeed
is
to
know
how
to
die

the
death
of
capitan
tiago
and
basilio
imprisonment
were
soon
reported
in
the
province
and
to
the
honor
of
the
simple
inhabitants
of
san
diego
let
it
be
recorded
that
the
latter
was
the
incident
more
regretted
and
almost
the
only
one
discussed
as
was
to
be
expected
the
report
took
on
different
forms
sad
and
startling
details
were
given
what
could
not
be
understood
was
explained
the
gaps
being
filled
by
conjectures
which
soon
passed
for
accomplished
facts
and
the
phantoms
thus
created
terrified
their
own
creators
in
the
town
of
tiani
it
was
reported
that
at
least
at
the
very
least
the
young
man
was
going
to
be
deported
and
would
very
probably
be
murdered
on
the
journey
the
timorous
and
pessimistic
were
not
satisfied
with
this
but
even
talked
about
executions
and
january
was
a
fatal
month
in
january
the
cavite
affair
had
occurred
and
even
though
curates
had
been
garroted
so
a
poor
basilio
without
protectors
or
friends
i
told
him
so
sighed
the
justice
of
the
peace
as
if
he
had
at
some
time
given
advice
to
basilio
i
told
him
so
it
was
to
be
expected
commented
sister
penchang
he
would
go
into
the
church
and
when
he
saw
that
the
holy
water
was
somewhat
dirty
he
would
cross
himself
with
it
he
talked
about
germs
and
disease
it
the
chastisement
of
god
he
deserved
it
and
he
got
it
as
though
the
holy
water
could
transmit
diseases
quite
the
contrary
she
then
related
how
she
had
cured
herself
of
indigestion
by
moistening
her
stomach
with
holy
water
at
the
same
time
reciting
the
and
she
recommended
the
remedy
to
those
present
when
they
should
suffer
from
dysentery
or
an
epidemic
occurred
only
that
then
they
must
pray
in
spanish
santo
diós
santo
fuerte
santo
inmortal
señor
de
la
peste
y
de
todo
mal
it
an
infallible
remedy
but
you
must
apply
the
holy
water
to
the
part
affected
she
concluded
but
there
were
many
persons
who
did
not
believe
in
these
things
nor
did
they
attribute
basilio
imprisonment
to
the
chastisement
of
god
nor
did
they
take
any
stock
in
insurrections
and
pasquinades
knowing
the
prudent
and
character
of
the
boy
but
preferred
to
ascribe
it
to
revenge
on
the
part
of
the
friars
because
of
his
having
rescued
from
servitude
juli
the
daughter
of
a
tulisan
who
was
the
mortal
enemy
of
a
certain
powerful
corporation
as
they
had
quite
a
poor
idea
of
the
morality
of
that
same
corporation
and
could
recall
cases
of
petty
revenge
their
conjecture
was
believed
to
have
more
probability
and
justification
what
a
good
thing
i
did
when
i
drove
her
from
my
house
said
sister
penchang
i
do
want
to
have
any
trouble
with
the
friars
so
i
urged
her
to
find
the
money
the
truth
was
however
that
she
regretted
juli
liberty
for
juli
prayed
and
fasted
for
her
and
if
she
had
stayed
a
longer
time
would
also
have
done
penance
why
if
the
curates
pray
for
us
and
christ
died
for
our
sins
could
juli
do
the
same
for
sister
penchang
when
the
news
reached
the
hut
where
the
poor
juli
and
her
grandfather
lived
the
girl
had
to
have
it
repeated
to
her
she
stared
at
sister
bali
who
was
telling
it
as
though
without
comprehension
without
ability
to
collect
her
thoughts
her
ears
buzzed
she
felt
a
sinking
at
the
heart
and
had
a
vague
presentiment
that
this
event
would
have
a
disastrous
influence
on
her
own
future
yet
she
tried
to
seize
upon
a
ray
of
hope
she
smiled
thinking
that
sister
bali
was
joking
with
her
a
rather
strong
joke
to
be
sure
but
she
forgave
her
beforehand
if
she
would
acknowledge
that
it
was
such
but
sister
bali
made
a
cross
with
one
of
her
thumbs
and
a
forefinger
and
kissed
it
to
prove
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
then
the
smile
faded
forever
from
the
girl
lips
she
turned
pale
frightfully
pale
she
felt
her
strength
leave
her
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
lost
consciousness
falling
into
a
swoon
when
by
dint
of
blows
pinches
dashes
of
water
crosses
and
the
application
of
sacred
palms
the
girl
recovered
and
remembered
the
situation
silent
tears
sprang
from
her
eyes
drop
by
drop
without
sobs
without
laments
without
complaints
she
thought
about
basilio
who
had
had
no
other
protector
than
capitan
tiago
and
who
now
with
the
capitan
dead
was
left
completely
unprotected
and
in
prison
in
the
philippines
it
is
a
fact
that
patrons
are
needed
for
everything
from
the
time
one
is
christened
until
one
dies
in
order
to
get
justice
to
secure
a
passport
or
to
develop
an
industry
as
it
was
said
that
his
imprisonment
was
due
to
revenge
on
account
of
herself
and
her
father
the
girl
sorrow
turned
to
desperation
now
it
was
her
duty
to
liberate
him
as
he
had
done
in
rescuing
her
from
servitude
and
the
inner
voice
which
suggested
the
idea
offered
to
her
imagination
a
horrible
means
padre
camorra
the
curate
whispered
the
voice
juli
gnawed
at
her
lips
and
became
lost
in
gloomy
meditation
as
a
result
of
her
father
crime
her
grandfather
had
been
arrested
in
the
hope
that
by
such
means
the
son
could
be
made
to
appear
the
only
one
who
could
get
him
his
liberty
was
padre
camorra
and
padre
camorra
had
shown
himself
to
be
poorly
satisfied
with
her
words
of
gratitude
having
with
his
usual
frankness
asked
for
some
sacrifices
since
which
time
juli
had
tried
to
avoid
meeting
him
but
the
curate
made
her
kiss
his
hand
he
twitched
her
nose
and
patted
her
cheeks
he
joked
with
her
winking
and
laughing
and
laughing
he
pinched
her
juli
was
also
the
cause
of
the
beating
the
good
curate
had
administered
to
some
young
men
who
were
going
about
the
village
serenading
the
girls
malicious
ones
seeing
her
pass
sad
and
dejected
would
remark
so
that
she
might
hear
if
she
only
wished
it
cabesang
tales
would
be
pardoned
juli
reached
her
home
gloomy
and
with
wandering
looks
she
had
changed
greatly
having
lost
her
merriment
and
no
one
ever
saw
her
smile
again
she
scarcely
spoke
and
seemed
to
be
afraid
to
look
at
her
own
face
one
day
she
was
seen
in
the
town
with
a
big
spot
of
soot
on
her
forehead
she
who
used
to
go
so
trim
and
neat
once
she
asked
sister
bali
if
the
people
who
committed
suicide
went
to
hell
surely
replied
that
woman
and
proceeded
to
describe
the
place
as
though
she
had
been
there
upon
basilio
imprisonment
the
simple
and
grateful
relatives
had
planned
to
make
all
kinds
of
sacrifices
to
save
the
young
man
but
as
they
could
collect
among
themselves
no
more
than
thirty
pesos
sister
bali
as
usual
thought
of
a
better
plan
what
we
must
do
is
to
get
some
advice
from
the
town
clerk
she
said
to
these
poor
people
the
town
clerk
was
what
the
delphic
oracle
was
to
the
ancient
greeks
by
giving
him
a
real
and
a
cigar
she
continued
he
tell
you
all
the
laws
so
that
your
head
bursts
listening
to
him
if
you
have
a
peso
he
save
you
even
though
you
may
be
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
when
my
friend
simon
was
put
in
jail
and
flogged
for
not
being
able
to
give
evidence
about
a
robbery
perpetrated
near
his
house
for
two
reales
and
a
half
and
a
string
of
garlics
the
town
clerk
got
him
out
and
i
saw
simon
myself
when
he
could
scarcely
walk
and
he
had
to
stay
in
bed
at
least
a
month
ay
his
flesh
rotted
as
a
result
and
he
died
sister
bali
advice
was
accepted
and
she
herself
volunteered
to
interview
the
town
clerk
juli
gave
her
four
reales
and
added
some
strips
of
jerked
venison
her
had
got
for
tandang
selo
had
again
devoted
himself
to
hunting
but
the
town
clerk
could
do
nothing
the
prisoner
was
in
manila
and
his
power
did
not
extend
that
far
if
at
least
he
were
at
the
capital
then
he
ventured
to
make
a
show
of
his
authority
which
he
knew
very
well
did
not
extend
beyond
the
boundaries
of
tiani
but
he
had
to
maintain
his
prestige
and
keep
the
jerked
venison
but
i
can
give
you
a
good
piece
of
advice
and
it
is
that
you
go
with
juli
to
see
the
justice
of
the
peace
but
it
very
necessary
that
juli
go
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
a
very
rough
fellow
but
if
he
should
see
juli
he
might
conduct
himself
less
rudely
this
is
wherein
lay
the
wisdom
of
the
advice
with
great
gravity
the
honorable
justice
listened
to
sister
bali
who
did
the
talking
but
not
without
staring
from
time
to
time
at
the
girl
who
hung
her
head
with
shame
people
would
say
that
she
was
greatly
interested
in
basilio
people
who
did
not
remember
her
debt
of
gratitude
nor
that
his
imprisonment
according
to
report
was
on
her
account
after
belching
three
or
four
times
for
his
honor
had
that
ugly
habit
he
said
that
the
only
person
who
could
save
basilio
was
padre
camorra
case
he
should
care
to
do
here
he
stared
meaningly
at
the
girl
and
advised
her
to
deal
with
the
curate
in
person
you
know
what
influence
he
has
he
got
your
out
of
jail
a
report
from
him
is
enough
to
deport
a
babe
or
save
from
death
a
man
with
the
noose
about
his
neck
juli
said
nothing
but
sister
bali
took
this
advice
as
though
she
had
read
it
in
a
novena
and
was
ready
to
accompany
the
girl
to
the
convento
it
so
happened
that
she
was
just
going
there
to
get
as
alms
a
scapulary
in
exchange
for
four
full
reales
but
juli
shook
her
head
and
was
unwilling
to
go
to
the
convento
sister
bali
thought
she
could
guess
the
reason
padre
camorra
was
reputed
to
be
very
fond
of
the
women
and
was
very
frolicsome
so
she
tried
to
reassure
her
you
nothing
to
fear
if
i
go
with
you
you
read
in
the
booklet
given
you
by
the
curate
that
the
girls
should
go
to
the
convento
even
without
the
knowledge
of
their
elders
to
relate
what
is
going
on
at
home
that
book
is
printed
with
the
permission
of
the
archbishop
juli
became
impatient
and
wished
to
cut
short
such
talk
so
she
begged
the
pious
woman
to
go
if
she
wished
but
his
honor
observed
with
a
belch
that
the
supplications
of
a
youthful
face
were
more
moving
than
those
of
an
old
one
the
sky
poured
its
dew
over
the
fresh
flowers
in
greater
abundance
than
over
the
withered
ones
the
metaphor
was
fiendishly
beautiful
juli
did
not
reply
and
the
two
left
the
house
in
the
street
the
girl
firmly
refused
to
go
to
the
convento
and
they
returned
to
their
village
sister
bali
who
felt
offended
at
this
lack
of
confidence
in
herself
on
the
way
home
relieved
her
feelings
by
administering
a
long
preachment
to
the
girl
the
truth
was
that
the
girl
could
not
take
that
step
without
damning
herself
in
her
own
eyes
besides
being
cursed
of
men
and
cursed
of
god
it
had
been
intimated
to
her
several
times
whether
with
reason
or
not
that
if
she
would
make
that
sacrifice
her
father
would
be
pardoned
and
yet
she
had
refused
in
spite
of
the
cries
of
her
conscience
reminding
her
of
her
filial
duty
now
must
she
make
it
for
basilio
her
sweetheart
that
would
be
to
fall
to
the
sound
of
mockery
and
laughter
from
all
creation
basilio
himself
would
despise
her
no
never
she
would
first
hang
herself
or
leap
from
some
precipice
at
any
rate
she
was
already
damned
for
being
a
wicked
daughter
the
poor
girl
had
besides
to
endure
all
the
reproaches
of
her
relatives
who
knowing
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
padre
camovra
laughed
at
her
fears
would
padre
camorra
fix
his
attention
upon
a
country
girl
when
there
were
so
many
others
in
the
town
hero
the
good
women
cited
names
of
unmarried
girls
rich
and
beautiful
who
had
been
more
or
less
unfortunate
meanwhile
if
they
should
shoot
basilio
juli
covered
her
ears
and
stared
wildly
about
as
if
seeking
a
voice
that
might
plead
for
her
but
she
saw
only
her
grandfather
who
was
dumb
and
had
his
gaze
fixed
on
his
that
night
she
scarcely
slept
at
all
dreams
and
nightmares
some
funereal
some
bloody
danced
before
her
sight
and
woke
her
often
bathed
in
cold
perspiration
she
fancied
that
she
heard
shots
she
imagined
that
she
saw
her
father
that
father
who
had
done
so
much
for
her
fighting
in
the
forests
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
because
she
had
refused
to
save
him
the
figure
of
her
father
was
transformed
and
she
recognized
basilio
dying
with
looks
of
reproach
at
her
the
wretched
girl
arose
prayed
wept
called
upon
her
mother
upon
death
and
there
was
even
a
moment
when
overcome
with
terror
if
it
had
not
been
she
would
have
run
straight
to
the
convento
let
happen
what
would
with
the
coming
of
day
the
sad
presentiments
and
the
terrors
of
darkness
were
partly
dissipated
the
light
inspired
hopes
in
her
but
the
news
of
the
afternoon
was
terrible
for
there
was
talk
of
persons
shot
so
the
next
night
was
for
the
girl
frightful
in
her
desperation
she
decided
to
give
herself
up
as
soon
as
day
dawned
and
then
kill
herself
afterwards
anything
rather
than
enditre
such
tortures
but
the
dawn
brought
new
hope
and
she
would
not
go
to
church
or
even
leave
the
house
she
was
afraid
she
would
yield
so
passed
several
days
in
praying
and
cursing
in
calling
upon
god
and
wishing
for
death
the
day
gave
her
a
slight
respite
and
she
trusted
in
some
miracle
the
reports
that
came
from
manila
although
they
reached
there
magnified
said
that
of
the
prisoners
some
had
secured
their
liberty
thanks
to
patrons
and
influence
some
one
had
to
be
sacrificed
who
would
it
be
juli
shuddered
and
returned
home
biting
her
then
came
the
night
with
its
terrors
which
took
on
double
proportions
and
seemed
to
be
converted
into
realities
juli
feared
to
fall
asleep
for
her
slumbers
were
a
continuous
nightmare
looks
of
reproach
would
flash
across
her
eyelids
just
as
soon
as
they
were
closed
complaints
and
laments
pierced
her
ears
she
saw
her
father
wandering
about
hungry
without
rest
or
repose
she
saw
basilio
dying
in
the
road
pierced
by
two
bullets
just
as
she
had
seen
the
corpse
of
that
neighbor
who
had
been
killed
while
in
the
charge
of
the
civil
guard
she
saw
the
bonds
that
cut
into
the
flesh
she
saw
the
blood
pouring
from
the
mouth
she
heard
basilio
calling
to
her
save
me
save
me
you
alone
can
save
me
then
a
burst
of
laughter
would
resound
and
she
would
turn
her
eyes
to
see
her
father
gazing
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
reproach
juli
would
wake
up
sit
up
on
her
and
draw
her
hands
across
her
forehead
to
arrange
her
hair
cold
sweat
like
the
sweat
of
death
moistened
it
mother
mother
she
sobbed
meanwhile
they
who
were
so
carelessly
disposing
of
people
fates
he
who
commanded
the
legal
murders
he
who
violated
justice
and
made
use
of
the
law
to
maintain
himself
by
force
slept
in
peace
at
last
a
traveler
arrived
from
manila
and
reported
that
all
the
prisoners
had
been
set
free
all
except
basilio
who
had
no
protector
it
was
reported
in
manila
added
the
traveler
that
the
young
man
would
be
deported
to
the
carolines
having
been
forced
to
sign
a
petition
beforehand
in
which
he
declared
that
he
asked
it
voluntarily
the
traveler
had
seen
the
very
steamer
that
was
going
to
take
him
away
this
report
put
an
end
to
all
the
girl
hesitation
besides
her
mind
was
already
quite
weak
from
so
many
nights
of
watching
and
horrible
dreams
pale
and
with
unsteady
eyes
she
sought
out
sister
bali
and
in
a
voice
that
was
cause
for
alarm
told
her
that
she
was
ready
asking
her
to
accompany
her
sister
bali
thereupon
rejoiced
and
tried
to
soothe
her
but
juli
paid
no
attention
to
her
apparently
intent
only
upon
hurrying
to
the
convento
she
had
decked
herself
out
in
her
finest
clothes
and
even
pretended
to
be
quite
gay
talking
a
great
deal
although
in
a
rather
incoherent
way
so
they
set
out
juli
went
ahead
becoming
impatient
that
her
companion
lagged
behind
but
as
they
neared
the
town
her
nervous
energy
began
gradually
to
abate
she
fell
silent
and
wavered
in
her
resolution
lessened
her
pace
and
soon
dropped
behind
so
that
sister
bali
had
to
encourage
her
we
get
there
late
she
remonstrated
juli
now
followed
pale
with
downcast
eyes
which
she
was
afraid
to
raise
she
felt
that
the
whole
world
was
staring
at
her
and
pointing
its
finger
at
her
a
vile
name
whistled
in
her
ears
but
still
she
disregarded
it
and
continued
on
her
way
nevertheless
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
convento
she
stopped
and
began
to
tremble
let
go
home
let
go
home
she
begged
holding
her
companion
back
sister
bali
had
to
take
her
by
the
arm
and
half
drag
her
along
reassuring
her
and
telling
her
about
the
books
of
the
friars
she
would
not
desert
her
so
there
was
nothing
to
fear
padre
camorra
had
other
things
in
mind
juli
was
only
a
poor
country
girl
but
upon
arriving
at
the
door
of
the
convento
juli
firmly
refused
to
go
in
catching
hold
of
the
wall
no
no
she
pleaded
in
terror
no
no
no
have
pity
but
what
a
fool
sister
bali
pushed
her
gently
along
juli
pallid
and
with
wild
features
offering
resistance
the
expression
of
her
face
said
that
she
saw
death
before
her
all
right
let
go
back
if
you
do
want
to
at
length
the
good
woman
exclaimed
in
irritation
as
she
did
not
believe
there
was
any
real
danger
padre
camorra
in
spite
of
all
his
reputation
would
dare
do
nothing
before
her
let
them
carry
poor
basilio
into
exile
let
them
shoot
him
on
the
way
saying
that
he
tried
to
escape
she
added
when
he
dead
then
remorse
will
come
but
as
for
myself
i
owe
him
no
favors
so
he
ca
reproach
me
that
was
the
decisive
stroke
in
the
face
of
that
reproach
with
wrath
and
desperation
mingled
like
one
who
rushes
to
suicide
juli
closed
her
eyes
in
order
not
to
see
the
abyss
into
which
she
was
hurling
herself
and
resolutely
entered
the
convento
a
sigh
that
sounded
like
the
rattle
of
death
escaped
from
her
lips
sister
bali
followed
telling
her
how
to
act
that
night
comments
were
mysteriously
whispered
about
certain
events
which
had
occurred
that
afternoon
a
girl
had
leaped
from
a
window
of
the
convento
falling
upon
some
stones
and
killing
herself
almost
at
the
same
time
another
woman
had
rushed
out
of
the
convento
to
run
through
the
streets
shouting
and
screaming
like
a
lunatic
the
prudent
townsfolk
dared
not
utter
any
names
and
many
mothers
pinched
their
daughters
for
letting
slip
expressions
that
might
compromise
them
later
very
much
later
at
twilight
an
old
man
came
from
a
village
and
stood
calling
at
the
door
of
the
convento
which
was
closed
and
guarded
by
sacristans
the
old
man
beat
the
door
with
his
fists
and
with
his
head
while
he
littered
cries
stifled
and
inarticulate
like
those
of
a
dumb
person
until
he
was
at
length
driven
away
by
blows
and
shoves
then
he
made
his
way
to
the
gobernadorcillo
house
but
was
told
that
the
gobernadorcillo
was
not
there
he
was
at
the
convento
he
went
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
but
neither
was
the
justice
of
the
peace
at
home
he
had
been
summoned
to
the
convento
he
went
to
the
but
he
too
was
at
the
convento
he
directed
his
steps
to
the
barracks
but
the
lieutenant
of
the
civil
guard
was
at
the
convento
the
old
man
then
returned
to
his
village
weeping
like
a
child
his
wails
were
heard
in
the
middle
of
the
night
causing
men
to
bite
their
lips
and
women
to
clasp
their
hands
while
the
dogs
slunk
fearfully
back
into
the
houses
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
ah
god
god
said
a
poor
woman
lean
from
fasting
in
thy
presence
there
is
no
rich
no
poor
no
white
no
black
thou
wilt
grant
us
justice
yes
rejoined
her
husband
just
so
that
god
they
preach
is
not
a
pure
invention
a
fraud
they
themselves
are
the
first
not
to
believe
in
him
at
eight
in
the
evening
it
was
rumored
that
more
than
seven
friars
proceeding
from
neighboring
towns
were
assembled
in
the
convento
to
hold
a
conference
on
the
following
day
tandang
selo
disappeared
forever
from
the
village
carrying
with
him
his
chapter
xxxi
the
high
official
et
sa
vertu
et
sa
grandeur
tout
va
victor
hugo
the
newspapers
of
manila
were
so
engrossed
in
accounts
of
a
notorious
murder
committed
in
europe
in
panegyrics
and
puffs
for
various
preachers
in
the
city
in
the
constantly
increasing
success
of
the
french
operetta
that
they
could
scarcely
devote
space
to
the
crimes
perpetrated
in
the
provinces
by
a
band
of
tulisanes
headed
by
a
fierce
and
terrible
leader
who
was
called
only
when
the
object
of
the
attack
was
a
convento
or
a
spaniard
there
then
appeared
long
articles
giving
frightful
details
and
asking
for
martial
law
energetic
measures
and
so
on
so
it
was
that
they
could
take
no
notice
of
what
had
occurred
in
the
town
of
tiani
nor
was
there
the
slightest
hint
or
allusion
to
it
in
private
circles
something
was
whispered
but
so
confused
so
vague
and
so
little
consistent
that
not
even
the
name
of
the
victim
was
known
while
those
who
showed
the
greatest
interest
forgot
it
quickly
trusting
that
the
affair
had
been
settled
in
some
way
with
the
wronged
family
the
only
one
who
knew
anything
certain
was
padre
camorra
who
had
to
leave
the
town
to
be
transferred
to
another
or
to
remain
for
some
time
in
the
convento
in
manila
poor
padre
camorra
exclaimed
in
a
fit
of
generosity
he
was
so
jolly
and
had
such
a
good
heart
it
was
true
that
the
students
had
recovered
their
liberty
thanks
to
the
exertions
of
their
relatives
who
did
not
hesitate
at
expense
gifts
or
any
sacrifice
whatsoever
the
first
to
see
himself
free
as
was
to
be
expected
was
makaraig
and
the
last
isagani
because
padre
florentine
did
not
reach
manila
until
a
week
after
the
events
so
many
acts
of
clemency
secured
for
the
general
the
title
of
clement
and
merciful
which
hastened
to
add
to
his
long
list
of
adjectives
the
only
one
who
did
not
obtain
his
liberty
was
basilio
since
he
was
also
accused
of
having
in
his
possession
prohibited
books
we
know
whether
this
referred
to
his
on
legal
medicine
or
to
the
pamphlets
that
were
found
dealing
with
the
philippines
or
both
together
the
fact
is
that
it
was
said
that
prohibited
literature
was
being
secretly
sold
and
upon
the
unfortunate
boy
fell
all
the
weight
of
the
rod
of
justice
it
was
reported
that
his
excellency
had
been
thus
advised
necessary
that
there
be
some
one
so
that
the
prestige
of
authority
may
be
sustained
and
that
it
may
not
be
said
that
we
made
a
great
fuss
over
nothing
authority
before
everything
it
necessary
that
some
one
be
made
an
example
of
let
there
be
just
one
one
who
according
to
padre
irene
was
the
servant
of
capitan
tiago
there
be
no
one
to
enter
a
complaint
servant
and
student
asked
his
excellency
that
fellow
then
let
it
be
he
your
excellency
will
pardon
me
observed
the
high
official
who
happened
to
be
present
but
i
been
told
that
this
boy
is
a
medical
student
and
his
teachers
speak
well
of
him
if
he
remains
a
prisoner
he
lose
a
year
and
as
this
year
he
finishes
the
high
official
interference
in
behalf
of
basilio
instead
of
helping
harmed
him
for
some
time
there
had
been
between
this
official
and
his
excellency
strained
relations
and
bad
feelings
augmented
by
frequent
clashes
yes
so
much
the
greater
reason
that
he
should
be
kept
prisoner
a
year
longer
in
his
studies
instead
of
injuring
him
will
do
good
not
only
to
himself
but
to
all
who
afterwards
fall
into
his
hands
one
does
become
a
bad
physician
by
extensive
practise
so
much
the
more
reason
that
he
should
remain
soon
the
filibustering
reformers
will
say
that
we
are
not
looking
out
for
the
country
concluded
his
excellency
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
the
high
official
realized
that
he
had
made
a
false
move
and
took
basilio
case
to
heart
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
young
man
is
the
most
innocent
of
all
he
rejoined
rather
timidly
books
have
been
seized
in
his
possession
observed
the
secretary
yes
works
on
medicine
and
pamphlets
written
by
peninsulars
with
the
leaves
uncut
and
besides
what
does
that
signify
moreover
this
young
man
was
not
present
at
the
banquet
in
the
he
has
mixed
up
in
anything
as
i
said
he
the
most
innocent
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
his
excellency
jocosely
in
that
way
the
punishment
will
prove
more
salutary
and
exemplary
since
it
inspires
greater
terror
to
govern
is
to
act
in
this
way
my
dear
sir
as
it
is
often
expedient
to
sacrifice
the
welfare
of
one
to
the
welfare
of
many
but
i
doing
more
from
the
welfare
of
one
will
result
the
welfare
of
all
the
principle
of
endangered
authority
is
preserved
prestige
is
respected
and
maintained
by
this
act
of
mine
i
correcting
my
own
and
other
people
faults
the
high
official
restrained
himself
with
an
effort
and
disregarding
the
allusion
decided
to
take
another
tack
but
does
your
excellency
fear
the
responsibility
what
have
i
to
fear
rejoined
the
general
impatiently
i
discretionary
powers
ca
i
do
what
i
please
for
the
better
government
of
these
islands
what
have
i
to
fear
can
some
menial
perhaps
arraign
me
before
the
tribunals
and
exact
from
me
responsibility
even
though
he
had
the
means
he
would
have
to
consult
the
ministry
first
and
the
minister
he
waved
his
hand
and
burst
out
into
laughter
the
minister
who
appointed
me
the
devil
knows
where
he
is
and
he
will
feel
honored
in
being
able
to
welcome
me
when
i
return
the
present
one
i
do
even
think
of
him
and
the
devil
take
him
too
the
one
that
relieves
him
will
find
himself
in
so
many
difficulties
with
his
new
duties
that
he
wo
be
able
to
fool
with
trifles
i
my
dear
sir
have
nothing
over
me
but
my
conscience
i
act
according
to
my
conscience
and
my
conscience
is
satisfied
so
i
do
care
a
straw
for
the
opinions
of
this
one
and
that
my
conscience
my
dear
sir
my
conscience
yes
general
but
the
country
tut
tut
tut
tut
the
country
what
have
i
to
do
avith
the
country
have
i
perhaps
contracted
any
obligations
to
it
do
i
owe
my
office
to
it
was
it
the
country
that
elected
me
a
brief
pause
ensued
during
which
the
high
official
stood
with
bowed
head
then
as
if
reaching
a
decision
he
raised
it
to
stare
fixedly
at
the
general
pale
and
trembling
he
said
with
repressed
energy
that
does
matter
general
that
does
matter
at
all
your
excellency
has
not
been
chosen
by
the
filipino
people
but
by
spain
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
treat
the
filipinos
well
so
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
reproach
spain
the
greater
reason
general
the
greater
reason
your
excellency
by
coming
here
has
contracted
the
obligation
to
govern
justly
to
seek
the
welfare
am
i
not
doing
it
interrupted
his
excellency
in
exasperation
taking
a
step
forward
have
i
told
you
that
i
am
getting
from
the
good
of
one
the
good
of
all
are
you
now
going
to
give
me
lessons
if
you
do
understand
my
actions
how
am
i
to
blame
do
i
compel
you
to
share
my
responsibility
certainly
not
replied
the
high
official
drawing
himself
up
proudly
your
excellency
does
not
compel
me
your
excellency
can
not
compel
me
to
share
responsibility
i
understand
mine
in
quite
another
way
and
because
i
have
it
i
going
to
speak
i
held
my
peace
a
long
time
oh
your
excellency
need
make
those
gestures
because
the
fact
that
i
come
here
in
this
or
that
capacity
mean
that
i
have
given
up
my
rights
that
i
have
been
reduced
to
the
part
of
a
slave
without
voice
or
dignity
i
do
want
spain
to
lose
this
beautiful
empire
these
eight
millions
of
patient
and
submissive
subjects
who
live
on
hopes
and
delusions
but
neither
do
i
wish
to
soil
my
hands
in
their
barbarous
exploitation
i
do
wish
it
ever
to
be
said
that
the
abolished
spain
has
continued
to
cloak
it
with
her
banner
and
perfect
it
under
a
wealth
of
specious
institutions
no
to
be
great
spain
does
not
have
to
be
a
tyrant
spain
is
sufficient
unto
herself
spain
was
greater
when
she
had
only
her
own
territory
wrested
from
the
clutches
of
the
moor
i
too
am
a
spaniard
but
before
being
a
spaniard
i
am
a
man
and
before
spain
and
above
spain
is
her
honor
the
lofty
principles
of
morality
the
eternal
principles
of
immutable
justice
ah
you
are
surprised
that
i
think
thus
because
you
have
no
idea
of
the
grandeur
of
the
spanish
name
no
you
have
any
idea
of
it
you
identify
it
with
persons
and
interests
to
you
the
spaniard
may
be
a
pirate
he
may
be
a
murderer
a
hypocrite
a
cheat
anything
just
so
he
keep
what
he
has
but
to
me
the
spaniard
should
lose
everything
empire
power
wealth
everything
before
his
honor
ah
my
dear
sir
we
protest
when
we
read
that
might
is
placed
before
right
yet
we
applaud
when
in
practise
we
see
might
play
the
hypocrite
in
not
only
perverting
right
but
even
in
using
it
as
a
tool
in
order
to
gain
control
for
the
very
reason
that
i
love
spain
i
speaking
now
and
i
defy
your
frown
i
do
wish
that
the
coming
ages
accuse
spain
of
being
the
stepmother
of
the
nations
the
vampire
of
races
the
tyrant
of
small
islands
since
it
would
be
a
horrible
mockery
of
the
noble
principles
of
our
ancient
kings
how
are
we
carrying
out
their
sacred
legacy
they
promised
to
these
islands
protection
and
justice
and
we
are
playing
with
the
lives
and
liberties
of
the
inhabitants
they
promised
civilization
are
curtailing
it
fearful
that
they
may
aspire
to
a
nobler
existence
they
promised
them
light
and
we
cover
their
eyes
that
they
may
not
witness
our
orgies
they
promised
to
teach
them
virtue
and
we
are
encouraging
their
vice
instead
of
peace
wealth
and
justice
confusion
reigns
commerce
languishes
and
skepticism
is
fostered
among
the
masses
let
us
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
the
filipinos
and
ask
ourselves
what
we
would
do
in
their
place
ah
in
your
silence
i
read
their
right
to
rebel
and
if
matters
do
not
mend
they
will
rebel
some
day
and
justice
will
be
on
their
side
with
them
will
go
the
sympathy
of
all
honest
men
of
every
patriot
in
the
world
when
a
people
is
denied
light
home
liberty
and
justice
things
that
are
essential
to
life
and
therefore
man
patrimony
that
people
has
the
right
to
treat
him
who
so
despoils
it
as
we
would
the
robber
who
intercepts
us
on
the
highway
there
are
no
distinctions
there
are
no
exceptions
nothing
but
a
fact
a
right
an
aggression
and
every
honest
man
who
does
not
place
himself
on
the
side
of
the
wronged
makes
himself
an
accomplice
and
stains
his
conscience
true
i
am
not
a
soldier
and
the
years
are
cooling
the
little
fire
in
my
blood
but
just
as
i
would
risk
being
torn
to
pieces
to
defend
the
integrity
of
spain
against
any
foreign
invader
or
against
an
unjustified
disloyalty
in
her
provinces
so
i
also
assure
you
that
i
would
place
myself
beside
the
oppressed
filipinos
because
i
would
prefer
to
fall
in
the
cause
of
the
outraged
rights
of
humanity
to
triumphing
with
the
selfish
interests
of
a
nation
even
when
that
nation
be
called
as
it
is
called
spain
do
you
know
when
the
leaves
inquired
his
excellency
coldly
when
the
high
official
had
finished
speaking
the
latter
stared
at
him
fixedly
then
dropped
his
head
and
silently
left
the
palace
outside
he
found
his
carriage
awaiting
him
some
day
when
you
declare
yourselves
independent
he
said
somewhat
abstractedly
to
the
native
lackey
who
opened
the
for
him
remember
that
there
were
not
lacking
in
spain
hearts
that
beat
for
you
and
struggled
for
your
rights
where
sir
asked
the
lackey
who
had
understood
nothing
of
this
and
was
inquiring
whither
they
should
go
two
hours
later
the
high
official
handed
in
his
resignation
and
announced
his
intention
of
returning
to
spain
by
the
next
chapter
xxxii
effect
of
the
pasquinades
as
a
result
of
the
events
narrated
many
mothers
ordered
their
sons
immediately
to
leave
off
their
studies
and
devote
themselves
to
idleness
or
to
agriculture
when
the
examinations
came
suspensions
were
plentiful
and
he
was
a
rare
exception
who
finished
the
course
if
he
had
belonged
to
the
famous
association
to
which
no
one
paid
any
more
attention
pecson
tadeo
and
juanito
pelaez
were
all
alike
suspended
the
first
receiving
his
dismissal
with
his
foolish
grin
and
declaring
his
intention
of
becoming
an
officer
in
some
court
while
tadeo
with
his
eternal
holiday
realized
at
last
paid
for
an
illumination
and
made
a
bonfire
of
his
books
nor
did
the
others
get
off
much
better
and
at
length
they
too
had
to
abandon
their
studies
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
their
mothers
who
always
fancy
their
sons
hanged
if
they
should
come
to
understand
what
the
books
teach
juanito
pelaez
alone
took
the
blow
ill
since
it
forced
him
to
leave
school
for
his
father
store
with
whom
he
was
thenceforward
to
be
associated
in
the
business
the
rascal
found
the
store
much
less
entertaining
but
after
some
time
his
friends
again
noticed
his
hump
appear
a
symptom
that
his
good
humor
was
returning
the
rich
makaraig
in
view
of
the
catastrophe
took
good
care
not
to
expose
himself
and
having
secured
a
passport
by
means
of
money
set
out
in
haste
for
europe
it
was
said
that
his
excellency
the
in
his
desire
to
do
good
by
good
means
and
careful
of
the
interests
of
the
filipinos
hindered
the
departure
of
every
one
who
could
not
first
prove
substantially
that
he
had
the
money
to
spend
and
could
live
in
idleness
in
european
cities
among
our
acquaintances
those
who
got
off
best
were
isagani
and
sandoval
the
former
passed
in
the
subject
he
studied
under
padre
fernandez
and
was
suspended
in
the
others
while
the
latter
was
able
to
confuse
the
with
his
oratory
basilio
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
pass
in
any
subject
who
was
not
suspended
and
who
did
not
go
to
europe
for
he
remained
in
bilibid
prison
subjected
every
three
days
to
examinations
almost
always
the
same
in
principle
without
other
variation
than
a
change
of
inquisitors
since
it
seemed
that
in
the
presence
of
such
great
guilt
all
gave
up
or
fell
away
in
horror
and
while
the
documents
moldered
or
were
shifted
about
while
the
stamped
papers
increased
like
the
plasters
of
an
ignorant
physician
on
the
body
of
a
hypochondriac
basilio
became
informed
of
all
the
details
of
what
had
happened
in
tiani
of
the
death
of
juli
and
the
disappearance
of
tandang
selo
sinong
the
abused
cochero
who
had
driven
him
to
san
diego
happened
to
be
in
manila
at
that
time
and
called
to
give
him
all
the
news
meanwhile
simoun
had
recovered
his
health
or
so
at
least
the
newspapers
said
rendered
thanks
to
the
omnipotent
who
watches
over
such
a
precious
life
and
manifested
the
hope
that
the
highest
would
some
day
reveal
the
malefactor
whose
crime
remained
unpunished
thanks
to
the
charity
of
the
victim
who
was
too
closely
following
the
words
of
the
great
martyr
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
these
and
other
things
said
in
print
while
by
mouth
he
was
inquiring
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
the
rumor
that
the
opulent
jeweler
was
going
to
give
a
grand
fiesta
a
banquet
such
as
had
never
before
been
seen
in
part
to
celebrate
his
recovery
and
in
part
as
a
farewell
to
the
country
in
which
he
had
increased
his
fortune
it
was
whispered
as
certain
that
simoun
who
would
have
to
leave
with
the
whose
command
expired
in
may
was
making
every
effort
to
secure
from
madrid
an
extension
and
that
he
was
advising
his
excellency
to
start
a
campaign
in
order
to
have
an
excuse
for
remaining
but
it
was
further
reported
that
for
the
first
time
his
excellency
had
disregarded
the
advice
of
his
favorite
making
it
a
point
of
honor
not
to
retain
for
a
single
additional
day
the
power
that
had
been
conferred
upon
him
a
rumor
which
encouraged
belief
that
the
fiesta
announced
would
take
place
very
soon
for
the
rest
simoun
remained
unfathomable
since
he
had
become
very
uncommunicative
showed
himself
seldom
and
smiled
mysteriously
when
the
rumored
fiesta
was
mentioned
come
señor
sindbad
had
once
rallied
him
dazzle
us
with
something
yankee
you
owe
something
to
this
country
doubtless
was
simoun
response
with
a
dry
smile
you
throw
the
house
wide
open
eh
maybe
but
as
i
have
no
house
you
ought
to
have
secured
capitan
tiago
which
señor
pelaez
got
for
nothing
simoun
became
silent
and
from
that
time
on
he
was
often
seen
in
the
store
of
don
timoteo
pelaez
with
whom
it
was
said
he
had
entered
into
partnership
some
weeks
afterward
in
the
month
of
april
it
was
rumored
that
juanito
pelaez
don
timoteo
son
was
going
to
marry
paulita
gomez
the
girl
coveted
by
spaniards
and
foreigners
some
men
are
lucky
exclaimed
other
envious
merchants
to
buy
a
house
for
nothing
sell
his
consignment
of
galvanized
iron
well
get
into
partnership
with
a
simoun
and
marry
his
son
to
a
rich
heiress
just
say
if
those
are
strokes
of
luck
that
all
honorable
men
do
have
if
you
only
knew
whence
came
that
luck
of
señor
pelaez
another
responded
in
a
tone
which
indicated
that
the
speaker
did
know
also
assured
that
there
be
a
fiesta
and
on
a
grand
scale
was
added
with
mystery
it
was
really
true
that
paulita
was
going
to
marry
juanito
pelaez
her
love
for
isagani
had
gradually
waned
like
all
first
loves
based
on
poetry
and
sentiment
the
events
of
the
pasquinades
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
youth
had
shorn
him
of
all
his
charms
to
whom
would
it
have
occurred
to
seek
danger
to
desire
to
share
the
fate
of
his
comrades
to
surrender
himself
when
every
one
was
hiding
and
denying
any
complicity
in
the
affair
it
was
quixotic
it
was
madness
that
no
sensible
person
in
manila
could
pardon
and
juanito
was
quite
right
in
ridiculing
him
representing
what
a
sorry
figure
he
cut
when
he
went
to
the
civil
government
naturally
the
brilliant
paulita
could
no
longer
love
a
young
man
who
so
erroneously
understood
social
matters
and
whom
all
condemned
then
she
began
to
reflect
juanito
was
clever
capable
gay
shrewd
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
of
manila
and
a
spanish
mestizo
besides
if
don
timoteo
was
to
be
believed
a
spaniard
on
the
other
hand
isagani
was
a
provincial
native
who
dreamed
of
forests
infested
with
leeches
he
was
of
doubtful
family
with
a
priest
for
an
uncle
who
would
perhaps
be
an
enemy
to
luxury
and
balls
of
which
she
was
very
fond
one
beautiful
morning
therefore
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
been
a
downright
fool
to
prefer
him
to
his
rival
and
from
that
time
on
pelaez
hump
steadily
increased
unconsciously
yet
rigorously
paulita
was
obeying
the
law
discovered
by
darwin
that
the
female
surrenders
herself
to
the
fittest
male
to
him
who
knows
how
to
adapt
himself
to
the
medium
in
which
he
lives
and
to
live
in
manila
there
was
no
other
like
pelaez
who
from
his
infancy
had
had
chicanery
at
his
lent
passed
with
its
holy
week
its
array
of
processions
and
pompous
displays
without
other
novelty
than
a
mysterious
mutiny
among
the
artillerymen
the
cause
of
which
was
never
disclosed
the
houses
of
light
materials
were
torn
down
in
the
presence
of
a
troop
of
cavalry
ready
to
fall
upon
the
owners
in
case
they
should
offer
resistance
there
was
a
great
deal
of
weeping
and
many
lamentations
but
the
affair
did
not
get
beyond
that
the
curious
among
them
simoun
went
to
see
those
who
were
left
homeless
walking
about
indifferently
and
assuring
each
other
that
thenceforward
they
could
sleep
in
peace
towards
the
end
of
april
all
the
fears
being
now
forgotten
manila
was
engrossed
with
one
topic
the
fiesta
that
don
timoteo
pelaez
was
going
to
celebrate
at
the
wedding
of
his
son
for
which
the
general
had
graciously
and
condescendingly
agreed
to
be
the
patron
simoun
was
reported
to
have
arranged
the
matter
the
ceremony
would
be
solemnized
two
days
before
the
departure
of
the
general
who
would
honor
the
house
and
make
a
present
to
the
bridegroom
it
was
whispered
that
the
jeweler
would
pour
out
cascades
of
diamonds
and
throw
away
handfuls
of
pearls
in
honor
of
his
partner
son
thus
since
he
could
hold
no
fiesta
of
his
own
as
he
was
a
bachelor
and
had
no
house
improving
the
opportunity
to
dazzle
the
filipino
people
with
a
memorable
farewell
all
manila
prepared
to
be
invited
and
never
did
uneasiness
take
stronger
hold
of
the
mind
than
in
view
of
the
thought
of
not
being
among
those
bidden
friendship
with
simoun
became
a
matter
of
dispute
and
many
husbands
were
forced
by
their
wives
to
purchase
bars
of
steel
and
sheets
of
galvanized
iron
in
order
to
make
friends
with
don
timoteo
pelaez
chapter
xxxiii
la
ultima
razón
at
last
the
great
day
arrived
during
the
morning
simoun
had
not
left
his
house
busied
as
he
was
in
packing
his
arms
and
his
jewels
his
fabulous
wealth
was
already
locked
up
in
the
big
steel
chest
with
its
canvas
cover
there
remaining
only
a
few
cases
containing
bracelets
and
pins
doubtless
gifts
that
he
meant
to
make
he
was
going
to
leave
with
the
who
cared
in
no
way
to
lengthen
his
stay
fearful
of
what
people
would
say
malicious
ones
insinuated
that
simoun
did
not
dare
remain
alone
since
without
the
general
support
he
did
not
care
to
expose
himself
to
the
vengeance
of
the
many
wretches
he
had
exploited
all
the
more
reason
for
which
was
the
fact
that
the
general
who
was
coming
was
reported
to
be
a
model
of
rectitude
and
might
make
him
disgorge
his
gains
the
superstitious
indians
on
the
other
hand
believed
that
simoun
was
the
devil
who
did
not
wish
to
separate
himself
from
his
prey
the
pessimists
winked
maliciously
and
said
the
field
laid
waste
the
locust
leaves
for
other
parts
only
a
few
a
very
few
smiled
and
said
nothing
in
the
afternoon
simoun
had
given
orders
to
his
servant
that
if
there
appeared
a
young
man
calling
himself
basilio
he
should
be
admitted
at
once
then
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
seemed
to
become
lost
in
deep
thought
since
his
illness
the
jeweler
countenance
had
become
harder
and
gloomier
while
the
wrinkles
between
his
eyebrows
had
deepened
greatly
he
did
not
hold
himself
so
erect
as
formerly
and
his
head
was
bowed
so
absorbed
was
he
in
his
meditations
that
he
did
not
hear
a
knock
at
the
door
and
it
had
to
be
repeated
he
shuddered
and
called
out
come
in
it
was
basilio
but
how
altered
if
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
simoun
during
those
two
months
was
great
in
the
young
student
it
was
frightful
his
cheeks
were
hollow
his
hair
unkempt
his
clothing
disordered
the
tender
melancholy
had
disappeared
from
his
eyes
and
in
its
place
glittered
a
dark
light
so
that
it
might
be
said
that
he
had
died
and
his
corpse
had
revived
horrified
with
what
it
had
seen
in
eternity
if
not
crime
then
the
shadow
of
crime
had
fixed
itself
upon
his
whole
appearance
simoun
himself
was
startled
and
felt
pity
for
the
wretch
without
any
greeting
basilio
slowly
advanced
into
the
room
and
in
a
voice
that
made
the
jeweler
shudder
said
to
him
señor
simoun
i
been
a
wicked
son
and
a
bad
brother
i
overlooked
the
murder
of
one
and
the
tortures
of
the
other
and
god
has
chastised
me
now
there
remains
to
me
only
one
desire
and
it
is
to
return
evil
for
evil
crime
for
crime
violence
for
violence
simoun
listened
in
silence
while
basilio
continued
four
months
ago
you
talked
to
me
about
your
plans
i
refused
to
take
part
in
them
but
i
did
wrong
you
have
been
right
three
months
and
a
half
ago
the
revolution
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
but
i
did
not
then
care
to
participate
in
it
and
the
movement
failed
in
payment
for
my
conduct
i
been
arrested
and
owe
my
liberty
to
your
efforts
only
you
are
right
and
now
i
come
to
say
to
you
put
a
weapon
in
my
hand
and
let
the
revolution
come
i
am
ready
to
serve
you
along
with
all
the
rest
of
the
unfortunates
the
cloud
that
had
darkened
simoun
brow
suddenly
disappeared
a
ray
of
triumph
darted
from
his
eyes
and
like
one
who
has
found
what
he
sought
he
exclaimed
i
right
yes
i
right
right
and
justice
are
on
my
side
because
my
cause
is
that
of
the
persecuted
thanks
young
man
thanks
you
come
to
clear
away
my
doubts
to
end
my
hesitation
he
had
risen
and
his
face
was
beaming
the
zeal
that
had
animated
him
when
four
months
before
he
had
explained
his
plans
to
basilio
in
the
wood
of
his
ancestors
reappeared
in
his
countenance
like
a
red
sunset
after
a
cloudy
day
yes
he
resumed
the
movement
failed
and
many
have
deserted
me
because
they
saw
me
disheartened
and
wavering
at
the
supreme
moment
i
still
cherished
something
in
my
heart
i
was
not
the
master
of
all
my
feelings
i
still
loved
now
everything
is
dead
in
me
no
longer
is
there
even
a
corpse
sacred
enough
for
me
to
respect
its
sleep
no
longer
will
there
be
any
vacillation
for
you
yourself
an
idealistic
youth
a
gentle
dove
understand
the
necessity
and
come
to
spur
me
to
action
somewhat
late
you
have
opened
your
eyes
for
between
you
and
me
together
we
might
have
executed
marvelous
plans
i
above
in
the
higher
circles
spreading
death
amid
perfume
and
gold
brutalizing
the
vicious
and
corrupting
or
paralyzing
the
few
good
and
you
below
among
the
people
among
the
young
men
stirring
them
to
life
amid
blood
and
tears
our
task
instead
of
being
bloody
and
barbarous
would
have
been
holy
perfect
artistic
and
surely
success
would
have
crowned
our
efforts
but
no
intelligence
would
support
me
i
encountered
fear
or
effeminacy
among
the
enlightened
classes
selfishness
among
the
rich
simplicity
among
the
youth
and
only
in
the
mountains
in
the
waste
places
among
the
outcasts
have
i
found
my
men
but
no
matter
now
if
we
ca
get
a
finished
statue
rounded
out
in
all
its
details
of
the
rough
block
we
work
upon
let
those
to
come
take
charge
seizing
the
arm
of
basilio
who
was
listening
without
comprehending
all
he
said
he
led
him
to
the
laboratory
where
he
kept
his
chemical
mixtures
upon
the
table
was
placed
a
large
case
made
of
dark
shagreen
similar
to
those
that
hold
the
silver
plate
exchanged
as
gifts
among
the
rich
and
powerful
opening
this
simoun
revealed
to
sight
upon
a
bottom
of
red
satin
a
lamp
of
very
peculiar
shape
its
body
was
in
the
form
of
a
pomegranate
as
large
as
a
man
head
with
fissures
in
it
exposing
to
view
the
seeds
inside
which
were
fashioned
of
enormous
carnelians
the
covering
was
of
oxidized
gold
in
exact
imitation
of
the
wrinkles
on
the
fruit
simoun
took
it
out
with
great
care
and
removing
the
burner
exposed
to
view
the
interior
of
the
tank
which
was
lined
with
steel
two
centimeters
in
thickness
and
which
had
a
capacity
of
over
a
liter
basilio
questioned
him
with
his
eyes
for
as
yet
he
comprehended
nothing
without
entering
upon
explanations
simoun
carefully
took
from
a
cabinet
a
flask
and
showed
the
young
man
the
formula
written
upon
it
murmured
basilio
stepping
backward
and
instinctively
thrusting
his
hands
behind
him
dynamite
beginning
now
to
understand
he
felt
his
hair
stand
on
end
yes
repeated
simoun
slowly
with
his
cold
smile
and
a
look
of
delight
at
the
glass
flask
it
also
something
more
than
it
concentrated
tears
repressed
hatred
wrongs
injustice
outrage
it
the
last
resort
of
the
weak
force
against
force
violence
against
violence
a
moment
ago
i
was
hesitating
but
you
have
come
and
decided
me
this
night
the
most
dangerous
tyrants
will
be
blown
to
pieces
the
irresponsible
rulers
that
hide
themselves
behind
god
and
the
state
whose
abuses
remain
unpunished
because
no
one
can
bring
them
to
justice
this
night
the
philippines
will
hear
the
explosion
that
will
convert
into
rubbish
the
formless
monument
whose
decay
i
have
fostered
basilio
was
so
terrified
that
his
lips
worked
without
producing
any
sound
his
tongue
was
paralyzed
his
throat
parched
for
the
first
time
he
was
looking
at
the
powerful
liquid
which
he
had
heard
talked
of
as
a
thing
distilled
in
gloom
by
gloomy
men
in
open
war
against
society
now
he
had
it
before
him
transparent
and
slightly
yellowish
poured
with
great
caution
into
the
artistic
pomegranate
simoun
looked
to
him
like
the
jinnee
of
the
that
sprang
from
the
sea
he
took
on
gigantic
proportions
his
head
touched
the
sky
he
made
the
house
tremble
and
shook
the
whole
city
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
the
pomegranate
assumed
the
form
of
a
colossal
sphere
the
fissures
became
hellish
grins
whence
escaped
names
and
glowing
cinders
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
basilio
was
overcome
with
fright
and
completely
lost
his
composure
simoun
meanwhile
screwed
on
solidly
a
curious
and
complicated
mechanism
put
in
place
a
glass
chimney
then
the
bomb
and
crowned
the
whole
with
an
elegant
shade
then
he
moved
away
some
distance
to
contemplate
the
effect
inclining
his
head
now
to
one
side
now
to
the
other
thus
better
to
appreciate
its
magnificent
appearance
noticing
that
basilio
was
watching
him
with
questioning
and
suspicious
eyes
he
said
tonight
there
will
be
a
fiesta
and
this
lamp
will
be
placed
in
a
little
that
i
had
constructed
for
the
purpose
the
lamp
will
give
a
brilliant
light
bright
enough
to
suffice
for
the
illumination
of
the
whole
place
by
itself
but
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
the
light
will
fade
and
then
when
some
one
tries
to
turn
up
the
wick
a
cap
of
fulminate
of
mercury
will
explode
the
pomegranate
will
blow
up
and
with
it
the
in
the
roof
and
floor
of
which
i
have
concealed
sacks
of
powder
so
that
no
one
shall
escape
there
wras
a
moment
silence
while
simoun
stared
at
his
mechanism
and
basilio
scarcely
breathed
so
my
assistance
is
not
needed
observed
the
young
man
no
you
have
another
mission
to
fulfill
replied
simoun
thoughtfully
at
nine
the
mechanism
will
have
exploded
and
the
report
will
have
been
heard
in
the
country
round
in
the
mountains
in
the
caves
the
uprising
that
i
had
arranged
with
the
artillerymen
was
a
failure
from
lack
of
plan
and
timeliness
but
this
time
it
be
so
upon
hearing
the
explosion
the
wretched
and
the
oppressed
those
who
wander
about
pursued
by
force
will
sally
forth
armed
to
join
cabesang
tales
in
santa
mesa
whence
they
will
fall
upon
the
city
while
the
soldiers
whom
i
have
made
to
believe
that
the
general
is
shamming
an
insurrection
in
order
to
remain
will
issue
from
their
barracks
ready
to
fire
upon
whomsoever
i
may
designate
meanwhile
the
cowed
populace
thinking
that
the
hour
of
massacre
has
come
will
rush
out
prepared
to
kill
or
be
killed
and
as
they
have
neither
arms
nor
organization
you
with
some
others
will
put
yourself
at
their
head
and
direct
them
to
the
warehouses
of
quiroga
where
i
keep
my
rifles
cabesang
tales
and
i
will
join
one
another
in
the
city
and
take
possession
of
it
while
you
in
the
suburbs
will
seize
the
bridges
and
throw
up
barricades
and
then
be
ready
to
come
to
our
aid
to
butcher
not
only
those
opposing
the
revolution
but
also
every
man
who
refuses
to
take
up
arms
and
join
us
all
stammered
basilio
in
a
choking
voice
all
repeated
simoun
in
a
sinister
tone
all
indians
mestizos
chinese
spaniards
all
who
are
found
to
be
without
courage
without
energy
the
race
must
be
renewed
cowardly
fathers
will
only
breed
slavish
sons
and
it
would
be
worth
while
to
destroy
and
then
try
to
rebuild
with
rotten
materials
what
do
you
shudder
do
you
tremble
do
you
fear
to
scatter
death
what
is
death
what
does
a
hecatomb
of
twenty
thousand
wretches
signify
twenty
thousand
miseries
less
and
millions
of
wretches
saved
from
birth
the
most
timid
ruler
does
not
hesitate
to
dictate
a
law
that
produces
misery
and
lingering
death
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
prosperous
and
industrious
subjects
happy
perchance
merely
to
satisfy
a
caprice
a
whim
his
pride
and
yet
you
shudder
because
in
one
night
are
to
be
ended
forever
the
mental
tortures
of
many
helots
because
a
vitiated
and
paralytic
people
has
to
die
to
give
place
to
another
young
active
full
of
energy
what
is
death
nothingness
or
a
dream
can
its
specters
be
compared
to
the
reality
of
the
agonies
of
a
whole
miserable
generation
the
needful
thing
is
to
destroy
the
evil
to
kill
the
dragon
and
bathe
the
new
people
in
the
blood
in
order
to
make
it
strong
and
invulnerable
what
else
is
the
inexorable
law
of
nature
the
law
of
strife
in
which
the
weak
has
to
succumb
so
that
the
vitiated
species
be
not
perpetuated
and
creation
thus
travel
backwards
away
then
with
effeminate
scruples
fulfill
the
eternal
laws
foster
them
and
then
the
earth
will
be
so
much
the
more
fecund
the
more
it
is
fertilized
with
blood
and
the
thrones
the
more
solid
the
more
they
rest
upon
crimes
and
corpses
let
there
be
no
hesitation
no
doubtings
what
is
the
pain
of
death
a
momentary
sensation
perhaps
confused
perhaps
agreeable
like
the
transition
from
waking
to
sleep
what
is
it
that
is
being
destroyed
evil
suffering
feeble
weeds
in
order
to
set
in
their
place
luxuriant
plants
do
you
call
that
destruction
i
should
call
it
creating
producing
nourishing
vivifying
such
bloody
sophisms
uttered
with
conviction
and
coolness
overwhelmed
the
youth
weakened
as
he
was
by
more
than
three
months
in
prison
and
blinded
by
his
passion
for
revenge
so
he
was
not
in
a
mood
to
analyze
the
moral
basis
of
the
matter
instead
of
replying
that
the
worst
and
cowardliest
of
men
is
always
something
more
than
a
plant
because
he
has
a
soul
and
an
intelligence
which
however
vitiated
and
brutalized
they
may
be
can
be
redeemed
instead
of
replying
that
man
has
no
right
to
dispose
of
one
life
for
the
benefit
of
another
that
the
right
to
life
is
inherent
in
every
individual
like
the
right
to
liberty
and
to
light
instead
of
replying
that
if
it
is
an
abuse
on
the
part
of
governments
to
punish
in
a
culprit
the
faults
and
crimes
to
which
they
have
driven
him
by
their
own
negligence
or
stupidity
how
much
more
so
would
it
be
in
a
man
however
great
and
however
unfortunate
he
might
be
to
punish
in
a
wretched
people
the
faults
of
its
governments
and
its
ancestors
instead
of
declaring
that
god
alone
can
use
such
methods
that
god
can
destroy
because
he
can
create
god
who
holds
in
his
hands
recompense
eternity
and
the
future
to
justify
his
acts
and
man
never
instead
of
these
reflections
basilio
merely
interposed
a
cant
reflection
what
will
the
world
say
at
the
sight
of
such
butchery
the
world
will
applaud
as
usual
conceding
the
right
of
the
strongest
the
most
violent
replied
simoun
with
his
cruel
smile
europe
applauded
when
the
western
nations
sacrificed
millions
of
indians
in
america
and
not
by
any
means
to
found
nations
much
more
moral
or
more
pacific
there
is
the

with
its
egotistic
liberty
its
its

the

not
fix
their

on

they
look
only
at

commit
the
crime
well
and
you
will
be

and
have
more
partizans
than
if
you
had
carried
out
virtuous
actions
with
modesty
and
timidity
exactly
rejoined
the
youth
what
does
it
matter
to
me
after
all
whether
they
praise
or
censure
when
this
world
takes
no
care
of
the
oppressed
of
the
poor
and
of
weak
womankind
what
obligations
have
i
to
recognize
toward
society
when
it
has
recognized
none
toward
me
that
what
i
like
to
hear
declared
the
tempter
triumphantly
he
took
a
revolver
from
a
case
and
gave
it
to
basilio
saying
at
ten
wait
for
me
in
front
of
the
church
of
sebastian
to
receive
my
final
instructions
ah
at
nine
you
must
be
far
very
far
from
calle
anloague
basilio
examined
the
weapon
loaded
it
and
placed
it
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
then
took
his
leave
with
a
curt
i
see
you
later
chapter
xxxiv
the
wedding
once
in
the
street
basilio
began
to
consider
how
he
might
spend
the
time
until
the
fatal
hour
arrived
for
it
was
then
not
later
than
seven
it
was
the
vacation
period
and
all
the
students
were
back
in
their
towns
isagani
being
the
only
one
who
had
not
cared
to
leave
but
he
had
disappeared
that
morning
and
no
one
knew
his
whereabouts
so
basilio
had
been
informed
when
after
leaving
the
prison
he
had
gone
to
visit
his
friend
and
ask
him
for
lodging
the
young
man
did
not
know
where
to
go
for
he
had
no
money
nothing
but
the
revolver
the
memory
of
the
lamp
filled
his
imagination
the
great
catastrophe
that
would
occur
within
two
hours
pondering
over
this
he
seemed
to
see
the
men
who
passed
before
his
eyes
walking
without
heads
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
ferocious
joy
in
telling
himself
that
hungry
and
destitute
he
that
night
was
going
to
be
dreaded
that
from
a
poor
student
and
servant
perhaps
the
sun
would
see
him
transformed
into
some
one
terrible
and
sinister
standing
upon
pyramids
of
corpses
dictating
laws
to
all
those
who
were
passing
before
his
gaze
now
in
magnificent
carriages
he
laughed
like
one
condemned
to
death
and
patted
the
butt
of
the
revolver
the
boxes
of
cartridges
were
also
in
his
pockets
a
question
suddenly
occurred
to
him
where
would
the
drama
begin
in
his
bewilderment
he
had
not
thought
of
asking
simoun
but
the
latter
had
warned
him
to
keep
away
from
calle
anloague
then
came
a
suspicion
that
afternoon
upon
leaving
the
prison
he
had
proceeded
to
the
former
house
of
capitan
tiago
to
get
his
few
personal
effects
and
had
found
it
transformed
prepared
for
a
fiesta
the
wedding
of
juanito
pelaez
simoun
had
spoken
of
a
fiesta
at
this
moment
he
noticed
passing
in
front
of
him
a
long
line
of
carriages
filled
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
conversing
in
a
lively
manner
and
he
even
thought
he
could
make
out
big
bouquets
of
flowers
but
he
gave
the
detail
no
thought
the
carriages
were
going
toward
calle
rosario
and
in
meeting
those
that
came
down
off
the
bridge
of
spain
had
to
move
along
slowly
and
stop
frequently
in
one
he
saw
juanito
pelaez
at
the
side
of
a
woman
dressed
in
white
with
a
transparent
veil
in
whom
he
recognized
paulita
gomez
paulita
he
ejaculated
in
surprise
realizing
that
it
was
indeed
she
in
a
bridal
gown
along
with
juanito
pelaez
as
though
they
were
just
coming
from
the
church
poor
isagani
he
murmured
what
can
have
become
of
him
he
thought
for
a
while
about
his
friend
a
great
and
generous
soul
and
mentally
asked
himself
if
it
would
not
be
well
to
tell
him
about
the
plan
then
answered
himself
that
isagani
would
never
take
part
in
such
a
butchery
they
had
not
treated
isagani
as
they
had
him
then
he
thought
that
had
there
been
no
imprisonment
he
would
have
been
betrothed
or
a
husband
at
this
time
a
licentiate
in
medicine
living
and
working
in
some
corner
of
his
province
the
ghost
of
juli
crushed
in
her
fall
crossed
his
mind
and
dark
flames
of
hatred
lighted
his
eyes
again
he
caressed
the
butt
of
the
revolver
regretting
that
the
terrible
hour
had
not
yet
come
just
then
he
saw
simoun
come
out
of
the
door
of
his
house
carrying
in
his
hands
the
case
containing
the
lamp
carefully
wrapped
up
and
enter
a
carriage
which
then
followed
those
bearing
the
bridal
party
in
order
not
to
lose
track
of
simoun
basilio
took
a
good
look
at
the
cochero
and
with
astonishment
recognized
in
him
the
wretch
who
had
driven
him
to
san
diego
sinong
the
fellow
maltreated
by
the
civil
guard
the
same
who
had
come
to
the
prison
to
tell
him
about
the
occurrences
in
tiani
conjecturing
that
calle
anloague
was
to
be
the
scene
of
action
thither
the
youth
directed
his
steps
hurrying
forward
and
getting
ahead
of
the
carriages
which
were
in
fact
all
moving
toward
the
former
house
of
capitan
tiago
there
they
were
assembling
in
search
of
a
ball
but
actually
to
dance
in
the
air
basilio
smiled
when
he
noticed
the
pairs
of
who
formed
the
escort
and
from
their
number
he
could
guess
the
importance
of
the
fiesta
and
the
guests
the
house
overflowed
with
people
and
poured
floods
of
light
from
its
windows
the
entrance
was
carpeted
and
strewn
with
flowers
upstairs
there
perhaps
in
his
former
solitary
room
an
orchestra
was
playing
lively
airs
which
did
not
completely
drown
the
confused
tumult
of
talk
and
laughter
don
timoteo
pelaez
was
reaching
the
pinnacle
of
fortune
and
the
reality
surpassed
his
dreams
he
was
at
last
marrying
his
son
to
the
rich
gomez
heiress
and
thanks
to
the
money
simoun
had
lent
him
he
had
royally
furnished
that
big
house
purchased
for
half
its
value
and
was
giving
in
it
a
splendid
fiesta
with
the
foremost
divinities
of
the
manila
olympus
for
his
guests
to
gild
him
with
the
light
of
their
prestige
since
that
morning
there
had
been
recurring
to
him
with
the
persistence
of
a
popular
song
some
vague
phrases
that
he
had
read
in
the
communion
service
now
has
the
fortunate
hour
come
now
draws
nigh
the
happy
moment
soon
there
will
be
fulfilled
in
you
the
admirable
words
of
simoun
live
and
yet
not
i
alone
but
the
liveth
in
me
the
the
patron
of
his
son
true
he
had
not
attended
the
ceremony
where
don
custodio
had
represented
him
but
he
would
come
to
dine
he
would
bring
a
a
lamp
which
not
even
aladdin
between
you
and
me
simoun
was
presenting
the
lamp
timoteo
what
more
could
you
desire
the
transformation
that
capitan
tiago
house
had
undergone
was
considerable
it
had
been
richly
repapered
while
the
smoke
and
the
smell
of
opium
had
been
completely
eradicated
the
immense
sala
widened
still
more
by
the
colossal
mirrors
that
infinitely
multiplied
the
lights
of
the
chandeliers
was
carpeted
throughout
for
the
salons
of
europe
had
carpets
and
even
though
the
floor
was
of
wide
boards
brilliantly
polished
a
carpet
it
must
have
too
since
nothing
should
be
lacking
the
rich
furniture
of
capitan
tiago
had
disappeared
and
in
its
place
was
to
be
seen
another
kind
in
the
style
of
louis
xv
heavy
curtains
of
red
velvet
trimmed
with
gold
with
the
initials
of
the
bridal
couple
worked
on
them
and
upheld
by
garlands
of
artificial
hung
as
portières
and
swept
the
floor
with
their
wide
fringes
likewise
of
gold
in
the
corners
appeared
enormous
japanese
vases
alternating
with
those
of
sèvres
of
a
clear
placed
upon
square
pedestals
of
carved
wood
the
only
decorations
not
in
good
taste
were
the
screaming
chromos
which
don
timoteo
had
substituted
for
the
old
drawings
and
pictures
of
saints
of
capitan
tiago
simoun
had
been
unable
to
dissuade
him
for
the
merchant
did
not
want
some
one
might
ascribe
them
to
filipino
artists
he
a
patron
of
filipino
artists
never
on
that
point
depended
his
peace
of
mind
and
perhaps
his
life
and
he
knew
how
to
get
along
in
the
philippines
it
is
true
that
he
had
heard
foreign
painters
mentioned
raphael
murillo
velasquez
but
he
did
not
know
their
addresses
and
then
they
might
prove
to
be
somewhat
seditious
with
the
chromos
he
ran
no
risk
as
the
filipinos
did
not
make
them
they
came
cheaper
the
effect
was
the
same
if
not
better
the
colors
brighter
and
the
execution
very
fine
do
say
that
don
timoteo
did
not
know
how
to
comport
himself
in
the
philippines
the
large
hallway
was
decorated
with
flowers
having
been
converted
into
a
with
a
long
table
for
thirty
persons
in
the
center
and
around
the
sides
pushed
against
the
walls
other
smaller
ones
for
two
or
three
persons
each
bouquets
of
flowers
pyramids
of
fruits
among
ribbons
and
lights
covered
their
centers
the
groom
place
was
designated
by
a
bunch
of
roses
and
the
bride
by
another
of
and
tuberoses
in
the
presence
of
so
much
finery
and
flowers
one
could
imagine
that
nymphs
in
gauzy
garments
and
cupids
with
iridescent
wings
were
going
to
serve
nectar
and
ambrosia
to
aerial
guests
to
the
sound
of
lyres
and
aeolian
harps
but
the
table
for
the
greater
gods
was
not
there
being
placed
yonder
in
the
middle
of
the
wide
azotea
within
a
magnificent
kiosk
constructed
especially
for
the
occasion
a
lattice
of
gilded
wood
over
which
clambered
fragrant
vines
screened
the
interior
from
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
without
impeding
the
free
circulation
of
air
to
preserve
the
coolness
necessary
at
that
season
a
raised
platform
lifted
the
table
above
the
level
of
the
others
at
which
the
ordinary
mortals
were
going
to
dine
and
an
arch
decorated
by
the
best
artists
would
protect
the
august
heads
from
the
jealous
gaze
of
the
stars
on
this
table
were
laid
only
seven
plates
the
dishes
were
of
solid
silver
the
cloth
and
napkins
of
the
finest
linen
the
wines
the
most
costly
and
exquisite
don
timoteo
had
sought
the
most
rare
and
expensive
in
everything
nor
would
he
have
hesitated
at
crime
had
he
been
assured

the

by
seven
in
the
evening
the
guests
had
begun
to
arrive
first
the
lesser
divinities
petty
government
officials
clerks
and
merchants
with
the
most
ceremonious
greetings
and
the
gravest
airs
at
the
start
as
if
they
were
parvenus
for
so
much
light
so
many
decorations
and
so
much
glassware
had
some
effect
afterwards
they
began
to
be
more
at
ease
shaking
their
fists
playfully
with
pats
on
the
shoulders
and
even
familiar
slaps
on
the
back
some
it
is
true
adopted
a
rather
disdainful
air
to
let
it
be
seen
that
they
were
accustomed
to
better
things
of
course
they
were
there
was
one
goddess
who
yawned
for
she
found
everything
vulgar
and
even
remarked
that
she
was
ravenously
hungry
while
another
quarreled
with
her
god
threatening
to
box
his
ears
don
timoteo
bowed
here
and
bowed
there
scattered
his
best
smiles
tightened
his
belt
stepped
backward
turned
halfway
round
then
completely
around
and
so
on
again
and
again
until
one
goddess
could
not
refrain
from
remarking
to
her
neighbor
under
cover
of
her
fan
my
dear
how
important
the
old
man
is
does
he
look
like
a

came
the

congratulations

the

and
with
a
little
his
hump
which
the
severity
of
his
frock
coat
did
not
altogether
conceal
could
be
taken
for
a
quiver
don
timoteo
began
to
feel
his
belt
squeezing
him
the
corns
on
his
feet
began
to
ache
his
neck
became
tired
but
still
the
general
had
not
come
the
greater
gods
among
them
padre
irene
and
padre
salvi
had
already
arrived
it
was
true
but
the
chief
thunderer
was
still
lacking
the
poor
man
became
uneasy
nervous
his
heart
beat
violently
but
still
he
had
to
bow
and
smile
he
sat
down
he
arose
failed
to
hear
what
was
said
to
him
did
not
say
what
he
meant
in
the
meantime
an
amateur
god
made
remarks
to
him
about
his
chromos
criticizing
them
with
the
statement
that
they
spoiled
the
walls
spoil
the
walls
repeated
don
timoteo
with
a
smile
and
a
desire
to
choke
him
but
they
were
made
in
europe
and
are
the
most
costly
i
could
get
in
manila
spoil
the
walls
don
timoteo
swore
to
himself
that
on
the
very
next
day
he
would
present
for
payment
all
the
chits
that
the
critic
had
signed
in
his
store
whistles
resounded
the
galloping
of
horses
was
heard
at
last
the
general
the
pale
with
emotion
don
timoteo
dissembling
the
pain
of
his
corns
and
accompanied
by
his
son
and
some
of
the
greater
gods
descended
to
receive
the
mighty
jove
the
pain
at
his
belt
vanished
before
the
doubts
that
now
assailed
him
should
he
frame
a
smile
or
affect
gravity
should
he
extend
his
hand
or
wait
for
the
general
to
offer
his
why
had
nothing
of
this
occurred
to
him
before
so
that
he
might
have
consulted
his
good
friend
simoun
to
conceal
his
agitation
he
whispered
to
his
son
in
a
low
shaky
voice
have
you
a
speech
prepared
speeches
are
no
longer
in
vogue
papa
especially
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
jupiter
arrived
in
the
company
of
juno
who
was
converted
into
a
tower
of
artificial
lights
with
diamonds
in
her
hair
diamonds
around
her
neck
on
her
arms
on
her
shoulders
she
was
literally
covered
with
diamonds
she
was
arrayed
in
a
magnificent
silk
gown
having
a
long
train
decorated
with
embossed
flowers
his
excellency
literally
took
possession
of
the
house
as
don
timoteo
stammeringly
begged
him
to
do
the
orchestra
played
the
royal
march
while
the
divine
couple
majestically
ascended
the
carpeted
stairway
nor
was
his
excellency
gravity
altogether
affected
perhaps
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
in
the
islands
he
felt
sad
a
strain
of
melancholy
tinged
his
thoughts
this
was
the
last
triumph
of
his
three
years
of
government
and
within
two
days
he
would
descend
forever
from
such
an
exalted
height
what
was
he
leaving
behind
his
excellency
did
not
care
to
turn
his
head
backwards
but
preferred
to
look
ahead
to
gaze
into
the
future
although
he
was
carrying
away
a
fortune
large
sums
to
his
credit
were
awaiting
him
in
european
banks
and
he
had
residences
yet
he
had
injured
many
he
had
made
enemies
at
the
court
the
high
official
was
waiting
for
him
there
other
generals
had
enriched
themselves
as
rapidly
as
he
and
now
they
were
ruined
why
not
stay
longer
as
simoun
had
advised
him
to
do
no
good
taste
before
everything
else
the
bows
moreover
were
not
now
so
profound
as
before
he
noticed
insistent
stares
and
even
looks
of
dislike
but
still
he
replied
affably
and
even
attempted
to
smile
it
plain
that
the
sun
is
setting
observed
padre
irene
in
ear
many
now
stare
him
in
the
face
the
devil
with
the
curate
that
was
just
what
he
was
going
to
remark
my
dear
murmured
into
the
ear
of
a
neighbor
the
lady
who
had
referred
to
don
timoteo
as
a
did
you
ever
see
such
a
skirt
ugh
the
curtains
from
the
palace
you
do
say
but
it
true
they
carrying
everything
away
see
how
they
make
wraps
out
of
the
carpets
that
only
goes
to
show
that
she
has
talent
and
taste
observed
her
husband
reproving
her
with
a
look
women
should
be
economical
this
poor
god
was
still
suffering
from
the
dressmaker
bill
my
dear
give
me
curtains
at
twelve
pesos
a
yard
and
you
see
if
i
put
on
these
rags
retorted
the
goddess
in
pique
heavens
you
can
talk
when
you
have
done
something
fine
like
that
to
give
you
the
right
meanwhile
basilio
stood
before
the
house
lost
in
the
throng
of
curious
spectators
counting
those
who
alighted
from
their
carriages
when
he
looked
upon
so
many
persons
happy
and
confident
when
he
saw
the
bride
and
groom
followed
by
their
train
of
fresh
and
innocent
little
girls
and
reflected
that
they
were
going
to
meet
there
a
horrible
death
he
was
sorry
and
felt
his
hatred
waning
within
him
he
wanted
to
save
so
many
innocents
he
thought
of
notifying
the
police
but
a
carriage
drove
up
to
set
down
padre
salvi
and
padre
irene
both
beaming
with
content
and
like
a
passing
cloud
his
good
intentions
vanished
what
does
it
matter
to
me
he
asked
himself
let
the
righteous
suffer
with
the
sinners
then
he
added
to
silence
his
scruples
i
not
an
informer
i
abuse
the
confidence
he
has
placed
in
me
i
owe
him
more
than
i
do
he
dug
my
mother
grave
they
killed
her
what
have
i
to
do
with
them
i
did
everything
possible
to
be
good
and
useful
i
tried
to
forgive
and
forget
i
suffered
every
imposition
and
only
asked
that
they
leave
me
in
peace
i
got
in
no
one
way
what
have
they
done
to
me
let
their
mangled
limbs
fly
through
the
air
suffered
enough
then
he
saw
simoun
alight
with
the
terrible
lamp
in
his
hands
saw
him
cross
the
entrance
with
bowed
head
as
though
deep
in
thought
basilio
felt
his
heart
beat
fainter
his
feet
and
hands
turn
cold
while
the
black
silhouette
of
the
jeweler
assumed
fantastic
shapes
enveloped
in
flames
there
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
simoun
checked
his
steps
as
if
in
doubt
and
basilio
held
his
breath
but
the
hesitation
was
transient
simoun
raised
his
head
resolutely
ascended
the
stairway
and
disappeared
it
then
seemed
to
the
student
that
the
house
was
going
to
blow
up
at
any
moment
and
that
walls
lamps
guests
roof
windows
orchestra
would
be
hurtling
through
the
air
like
a
handful
of
coals
in
the
midst
of
an
infernal
explosion
he
gazed
about
him
and
fancied
that
he
saw
corpses
in
place
of
idle
spectators
he
saw
them
torn
to
shreds
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
air
was
filled
with
flames
but
his
calmer
self
triumphed
over
this
transient
hallucination
which
was
due
somewhat
to
his
hunger
until
he
comes
out
there
no
danger
he
said
to
himself
the
has
arrived
yet
he
tried
to
appear
calm
and
control
the
convulsive
trembling
in
his
limbs
endeavoring
to
divert
his
thoughts
to
other
things
something
within
was
ridiculing
him
saying
if
you
tremble
now
before
the
supreme
moment
how
will
you
conduct
yourself
when
you
see
blood
flowing
houses
burning
and
bullets
whistling
his
excellency
arrived
but
the
young
man
paid
no
attention
to
him
he
was
watching
the
face
of
simoun
who
was
among
those
that
descended
to
receive
him
and
he
read
in
that
implacable
countenance
the
sentence
of
death
for
all
those
men
so
that
fresh
terror
seized
upon
him
he
felt
cold
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
windows
and
his
ears
cocked
tried
to
guess
what
might
be
happening
in
the
sala
he
saw
the
crowd
surround
simoun
to
look
at
the
lamp
he
heard
congratulations
and
exclamations
of
admiration
the
words
novelty
were
repeated
many
times
he
saw
the
general
smile
and
conjectured
that
the
novelty
was
to
be
exhibited
that
very
night
by
the
jeweler
arrangement
on
the
table
whereat
his
excellency
was
to
dine
simoun
disappeared
followed
by
a
crowd
of
admirers
at
that
supreme
moment
his
good
angel
triumphed
he
forgot
his
hatreds
he
forgot
juli
he
wanted
to
save
the
innocent
come
what
might
he
would
cross
the
street
and
try
to
enter
but
basilio
had
forgotten
that
he
was
miserably
dressed
the
porter
stopped
him
and
accosted
him
roughly
and
finally
upon
his
insisting
threatened
to
call
the
police
just
then
simoun
came
down
slightly
pale
and
the
porter
turned
from
basilio
to
salute
the
jeweler
as
though
he
had
been
a
saint
passing
basilio
realized
from
the
expression
of
simoun
face
that
he
was
leaving
the
fated
house
forever
that
the
lamp
was
lighted
jacta
est
seized
by
the
instinct
of
he
thought
then
of
saving
himself
it
might
occur
to
any
of
the
guests
through
curiosity
to
tamper
with
the
wick
and
then
would
come
the
explosion
to
overwhelm
them
all
still
he
heard
simoun
say
to
the
cochero
the
escolta
hurry
terrified
dreading
that
he
might
at
any
moment
hear
the
awful
explosion
basilio
hurried
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
to
get
away
from
the
accursed
spot
but
his
legs
seemed
to
lack
the
necessary
agility
his
feet
slipped
on
the
sidewalk
as
though
they
were
moving
but
not
advancing
the
people
he
met
blocked
the
way
and
before
he
had
gone
twenty
steps
he
thought
that
at
least
five
minutes
had
elapsed
some
distance
away
he
stumbled
against
a
young
man
who
was
standing
with
his
head
thrown
back
gazing
fixedly
at
the
house
and
in
him
he
recognized
isagani
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
come
away
isagani
stared
at
him
vaguely
smiled
sadly
and
again
turned
his
gaze
toward
the
open
balconies
across
which
was
revealed
the
ethereal
silhouette
of
the
bride
clinging
to
the
groom
arm
as
they
moved
slowly
out
of
sight
come
isagani
let
get
away
from
that
house
come
basilio
urged
in
a
hoarse
voice
catching
his
friend
by
the
arm
isagani
gently
shook
himself
free
and
continued
to
stare
with
the
same
sad
smile
upon
his
lips
for
god
sake
let
get
away
from
here
why
should
i
go
away
tomorrow
it
will
not
be
she
there
was
so
much
sorrow
in
those
words
that
basilio
for
a
moment
forgot
his
own
terror
do
you
want
to
die
he
demanded
isagani
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
to
gaze
toward
the
house
basilio
again
tried
to
drag
him
away
isagani
isagani
listen
to
me
let
not
waste
any
time
that
house
is
mined
it
going
to
blow
up
at
any
moment
by
the
least
imprudent
act
the
least
curiosity
isagani
all
will
perish
in
its
ruins
in
its
ruins
echoed
isagani
as
if
trying
to
understand
but
without
removing
his
gaze
from
the
window
yes
in
its
ruins
yes
isagani
for
god
sake
come
i
explain
afterwards
come
one
who
has
been
more
unfortunate
than
either
you
or
i
has
doomed
them
all
do
you
see
that
white
clear
light
like
an
electric
lamp
shining
from
the
azotea
it
the
light
of
death
a
lamp
charged
with
dynamite
in
a
mined
will
burst
and
not
a
rat
will
escape
alive
come
no
answered
isagani
shaking
his
head
sadly
i
want
to
stay
here
i
want
to
see
her
for
the
last
time
tomorrow
you
see
she
will
be
something
different
let
fate
have
its
way
basilio
then
exclaimed
hurrying
away
isagani
watched
his
friend
rush
away
with
a
precipitation
that
indicated
real
terror
but
continued
to
stare
toward
the
charmed
window
like
the
cavalier
of
toggenburg
waiting
for
his
sweetheart
to
appear
as
schiller
tells
now
the
sala
was
deserted
all
having
repaired
to
the
and
it
occurred
to
isagani
that
fears
may
have
been
he
recalled
the
terrified
countenance
of
him
who
was
always
so
calm
and
composed
and
it
set
him
to
thinking
suddenly
an
idea
appeared
clear
in
his
imagination
the
house
was
going
to
blow
up
and
paulita
was
there
paulita
was
going
to
die
a
frightful
death
in
the
presence
of
this
idea
everything
was
forgotten
jealousy
suffering
mental
torture
and
the
generous
youth
thought
only
of
his
love
without
reflecting
without
hesitation
he
ran
toward
the
house
and
thanks
to
his
stylish
clothes
and
determined
mien
easily
secured
admittance
while
these
short
scenes
were
occurring
in
the
street
in
the
of
the
greater
gods
there
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
a
piece
of
parchment
on
which
were
written
in
red
ink
these
fateful
words
tekel
crisostomo
juan
crisostomo
ibarra
who
is
he
asked
his
excellency
handing
the
paper
to
his
neighbor
a
joke
in
very
bad
taste
exclaimed
don
custodio
to
sign
the
name
of
a
filibuster
dead
more
than
ten
years
a
filibuster
it
a
seditious
joke
there
being
ladies
present
padre
irene
looked
around
for
the
joker
and
saw
padre
salvi
who
was
seated
at
the
right
of
the
countess
turn
as
white
as
his
napkin
while
he
stared
at
the
mysterious
words
with
bulging
eyes
the
scene
of
the
sphinx
recurred
to
him
what
the
matter
padre
salvi
he
asked
do
you
recognize
your
friend
signature
padre
salvi
did
not
reply
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
and
without
being
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
napkin
what
has
happened
to
your
reverence
it
is
his
very
handwriting
was
the
whispered
reply
in
a
scarcely
perceptible
voice
it
the
very
handwriting
of
ibarra
leaning
against
the
back
of
his
chair
he
let
his
arms
fall
as
though
all
strength
had
deserted
him
uneasiness
became
converted
into
fright
they
all
stared
at
one
another
without
uttering
a
single
word
his
excellency
started
to
rise
but
apprehending
that
such
a
move
would
be
ascribed
to
fear
controlled
himself
and
looked
about
him
there
were
no
soldiers
present
even
the
waiters
were
unknown
to
him
let
go
on
eating
gentlemen
he
exclaimed
and
pay
no
attention
to
the
joke
but
his
voice
instead
of
reassuring
increased
the
general
uneasiness
for
it
trembled
i
do
suppose
that
that
tekel
means
that
to
be
assassinated
tonight
speculated
don
custodio
all
remained
motionless
but
when
he
added
yet
they
might
poison
us
they
leaped
up
from
their
chairs
the
light
meanwhile
had
begun
slowly
to
fade
the
lamp
is
going
out
observed
the
general
uneasily
will
you
turn
up
the
wick
padre
irene
but
at
that
instant
with
the
swiftness
of
a
flash
of
lightning
a
figure
rushed
in
overturning
a
chair
and
knocking
a
servant
down
and
in
the
midst
of
the
general
surprise
seized
the
lamp
rushed
to
the
azotea
and
threw
it
into
the
river
the
whole
thing
happened
in
a
second
and
the
was
left
in
darkness
the
lamp
had
already
struck
the
water
before
the
servants
could
cry
out
thief
thief
and
rush
toward
the
azotea
a
revolver
cried
one
of
them
a
revolver
quick
after
the
thief
but
the
figure
more
agile
than
they
had
already
mounted
the
balustrade
and
before
a
light
could
be
brought
precipitated
itself
into
the
river
striking
the
water
with
a
loud
splash
chapter

afflictions
immediately
upon
hearing
of
the
incident
after
lights
had
been
brought
and
the
scarcely
dignified
attitudes
of
the
startled
gods
revealed
filled
with
holy
indignation
and
with
the
approval
of
the
secured
beforehand
hastened
home
an
entresol
where
he
lived
in
a
mess
with
others
to
write
an
article
that
would
be
the
sublimest
ever
penned
under
the
skies
of
the
philippines
the
would
leave
disconsolate
if
he
did
not
first
enjoy
his
dithyrambs
and
this
in
his
kindness
of
heart
could
not
allow
hence
he
sacrificed
the
dinner
and
ball
nor
did
he
sleep
that
night
sonorous
exclamations
of
horror
of
indignation
to
fancy
that
the
world
was
smashing
to
pieces
and
the
stars
the
eternal
stars
were
clashing
together
then
a
mysterious
introduction
filled
with
allusions
veiled
hints
then
an
account
of
the
affair
and
the
final
peroration
he
multiplied
the
flourishes
and
exhausted
all
his
euphemisms
in
describing
the
drooping
shoulders
and
the
tardy
baptism
of
salad
his
excellency
had
received
on
his
olympian
brow
he
eulogized
the
agility
with
which
the
general
had
recovered
a
vertical
position
placing
his
head
where
his
legs
had
been
and
vice
versa
then
intoned
a
hymn
to
providence
for
having
so
solicitously
guarded
those
sacred
bones
the
paragraph
turned
out
to
be
so
perfect
that
his
excellency
appeared
as
a
hero
and
fell
higher
as
victor
hugo
said
he
wrote
erased
added
and
polished
so
that
without
wanting
in
veracity
this
was
his
special
merit
as
a
journalist
the
whole
would
be
an
epic
grand
for
the
seven
gods
cowardly
and
base
for
the
unknown
thief
who
had
executed
himself
and
in
the
very
act
convinced
of
the
enormity
of
his
crime
he
explained
padre
irene
act
of
plunging
under
the
table
as
an
impulse
of
innate
valor
which
the
habit
of
a
god
of
peace
and
gentleness
worn
throughout
a
whole
life
had
been
unable
to
extinguish
for
padre
irene
had
tried
to
hurl
himself
upon
the
thief
and
had
taken
a
straight
course
along
the
submensal
route
in
passing
he
spoke
of
submarine
passages
mentioned
a
project
of
don
custodio
called
attention
to
the
liberal
education
and
wide
travels
of
the
priest
padre
salvi
swoon
was
the
excessive
sorrow
that
took
possession
of
the
virtuous
franciscan
to
see
the
little
fruit
borne
among
the
indians
by
his
pious
sermons
while
the
immobility
and
fright
of
the
other
guests
among
them
the
countess
who
sustained
padre
salvi
she
grabbed
him
were
the
serenity
and
of
heroes
inured
to
danger
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
beside
whom
the
roman
senators
surprised
by
the
gallic
invaders
were
nervous
schoolgirls
frightened
at
painted
cockroaches
afterwards
to
form
a
contrast
the
picture
of
the
thief
fear
madness
confusion
the
fierce
look
the
distorted
features
and
force
of
moral
superiority
in
the
race
his
religious
awe
to
see
assembled
there
such
august
personages
here
came
in
opportunely
a
long
imprecation
a
harangue
a
diatribe
against
the
perversion
of
good
customs
hence
the
necessity
of
a
permanent
military
tribunal
a
declaration
of
martial
law
within
the
limits
already
so
declared
special
legislation
energetic
and
repressive
because
it
is
in
every
way
needful
it
is
of
imperative
importance
to
impress
upon
the
malefactors
and
criminals
that
if
the
heart
is
generous
and
paternal
for
those
who
are
submissive
and
obedient
to
the
law
the
hand
is
strong
firm
inexorable
hard
and
severe
for
those
who
against
all
reason
fail
to
respect
it
and
who
insult
the
sacred
institutions
of
the
fatherland
yes
gentlemen
this
is
demanded
not
only
for
the
welfare
of
these
islands
not
only
for
the
welfare
of
all
mankind
but
also
in
the
name
of
spain
the
honor
of
the
spanish
name
the
prestige
of
the
iberian
people
because
before
all
things
else
spaniards
we
are
and
the
flag
of
spain
etc
he
terminated
the
article
with
this
farewell
go
in
peace
gallant
warrior
you
who
with
expert
hand
have
guided
the
destinies
of
this
country
in
such
calamitous
times
go
in
peace
to
breathe
the
balmy
breezes
of
manzanares
we
shall
remain
here
like
faithful
sentinels
to
venerate
your
memory
to
admire
your
wise
dispositions
to
avenge
the
infamous
attempt
upon
your
splendid
gift
which
we
will
recover
even
if
we
have
to
dry
up
the
seas
such
a
precious
relic
will
be
for
this
country
an
eternal
monument
to
your
splendor
your
presence
of
mind
your
gallantry
in
this
rather
confused
way
he
concluded
the
article
and
before
dawn
sent
it
to
the
of
course
with
the
permit
then
he
went
to
sleep
like
napoleon
after
he
had
arranged
the
plan
for
the
battle
of
jena
but
at
dawn
he
was
awakened
to
have
the
sheets
of
copy
returned
with
a
note
from
the
editor
saying
that
his
excellency
had
positively
and
severely
forbidden
any
mention
of
the
affair
and
had
further
ordered
the
denial
of
any
versions
and
comments
that
might
get
abroad
discrediting
them
as
exaggerated
rumors
to
this
blow
was
the
murder
of
a
beautiful
and
sturdy
child
born
and
nurtured
with
such
great
pain
and
fatigue
where
now
hurl
the
catilinarian
pride
the
splendid
exhibition
of
warlike
materials
and
to
think
that
within
a
month
or
two
he
was
going
to
leave
the
philippines
and
the
article
could
not
be
published
in
spain
since
how
could
he
say
those
things
about
the
criminals
of
madrid
where
other
ideas
prevailed
where
extenuating
circumstances
were
sought
where
facts
were
weighed
where
there
were
juries
and
so
on
articles
such
as
his
were
like
certain
poisonous
rums
that
are
manufactured
in
europe
good
enough
to
be
sold
among
the
negroes
for
with
the
difference
that
if
the
negroes
did
not
drink
them
they
would
not
be
destroyed
while
articles
whether
the
filipinos
read
them
or
not
had
their
effect
if
only
some
other
crime
might
be
committed
today
or
tomorrow
he
mused
with
the
thought
of
that
child
dead
before
seeing
the
light
those
frozen
buds
and
feeling
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
he
dressed
himself
to
call
upon
the
editor
but
the
editor
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
excellency
had
forbidden
it
because
if
it
should
be
divulged
that
seven
of
the
greater
gods
had
let
themselves
be
surprised
and
robbed
by
a
nobody
while
they
brandished
knives
and
forks
that
would
endanger
the
integrity
of
the
fatherland
so
he
had
ordered
that
no
search
be
made
for
the
lamp
or
the
thief
and
had
recommended
to
his
successors
that
they
should
not
run
the
risk
of
dining
in
any
private
house
without
being
surrounded
by
halberdiers
and
guards
as
those
who
knew
anything
about
the
events
that
night
in
don
timoteo
house
were
for
the
most
part
military
officials
and
government
employees
it
was
not
difficult
to
suppress
the
affair
in
public
for
it
concerned
the
integrity
of
the
fatherland
before
this
name
bowed
his
head
heroically
thinking
about
abraham
guzman
el
bueno
or
at
least
brutus
and
other
heroes
of
antiquity
such
a
sacrifice
could
not
remain
unrewarded
the
gods
of
journalism
being
pleased
with
abraham
almost
upon
the
hour
came
the
reporting
angel
bearing
the
sacrificial
lamb
in
the
shape
of
an
assault
committed
at
a
on
the
pasig
where
certain
friars
were
spending
the
heated
season
here
was
his
opportunity
and
praised
his
gods
the
robbers
got
over
two
thousand
pesos
leaving
badly
wounded
one
friar
and
two
servants
the
curate
defended
himself
as
well
as
he
could
behind
a
chair
which
was
smashed
in
his
hands
wait
wait
said
taking
notes
forty
or
fifty
outlaws
traitorously
revolvers
bolos
shotguns
pistols
lion
at
bay
chair
splinters
flying
barbarously
wounded
ten
thousand
pesos
so
great
was
his
enthusiasm
that
he
was
not
content
with
mere
reports
but
proceeded
in
person
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
composing
on
the
road
a
homeric
description
of
the
fight
a
harangue
in
the
mouth
of
the
leader
a
scornful
defiance
on
the
part
of
the
priest
all
the
metaphors
and
similes
applied
to
his
excellency
padre
irene
and
padre
salvi
would
exactly
fit
the
wounded
friar
and
the
description
of
the
thief
would
serve
for
each
of
the
outlaws
the
imprecation
could
be
expanded
since
he
could
talk
of
religion
of
the
faith
of
charity
of
the
ringing
of
bells
of
what
the
indians
owed
to
the
friars
he
could
get
sentimental
and
melt
into
castelarian
epigrams
and
lyric
periods
the
señoritas
of
the
city
would
read
the
article
and
murmur
bold
as
a
lion
and
tender
as
a
lamb
but
when
he
reached
the
scene
to
his
great
astonishment
he
learned
that
the
wounded
friar
was
no
other
than
padre
camorra
sentenced
by
his
provincial
to
expiate
in
the
pleasant
on
the
banks
of
the
pasig
his
pranks
in
tiani
he
had
a
slight
scratch
on
his
hand
and
a
bruise
on
his
head
received
from
flattening
himself
out
on
the
floor
the
robbers
numbered
three
or
four
armed
only
with
bolos
the
sum
stolen
fifty
pesos
it
wo
do
exclaimed
shut
up
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
how
do
i
know
do
be
a
fool
the
robbers
must
have
numbered
more
you
so
they
had
quite
an
altercation
what
chiefly
concerned
was
not
to
throw
away
the
article
to
give
importance
to
the
affair
so
that
he
could
use
the
peroration
but
a
fearful
rumor
cut
short
their
dispute
the
robbers
caught
had
made
some
important
revelations
one
of
the
outlaws
under
cabesang
tales
had
made
an
appointment
with
them
to
join
his
band
in
santa
mesa
thence
to
sack
the
conventos
and
houses
of
the
wealthy
they
would
be
guided
by
a
spaniard
tall
and
sunburnt
with
white
hair
who
said
that
he
was
acting
under
the
orders
of
the
general
whose
great
friend
he
was
and
they
had
been
further
assured
that
the
artillery
and
various
regiments
would
join
them
wherefore
they
were
to
entertain
no
fear
at
all
the
tulisanes
would
be
pardoned
and
have
a
third
part
of
the
booty
assigned
to
them
the
signal
was
to
have
been
a
but
having
waited
for
it
in
vain
the
tulisanes
thinking
themselves
deceived
separated
some
going
back
to
their
homes
some
returning
to
the
mountains
vowing
vengeance
on
the
spaniard
who
had
thus
failed
twice
to
keep
his
word
then
they
the
robbers
caught
had
decided
to
do
something
on
their
own
account
attacking
the
that
they
found
closest
at
hand
resolving
religiously
to
give
of
the
booty
to
the
spaniard
with
white
hair
if
perchance
he
should
call
upon
them
for
it
the
description
being
recognized
as
that
of
simoun
the
declaration
was
received
as
an
absurdity
and
the
robber
subjected
to
all
kinds
of
tortures
including
the
electric
machine
for
his
impious
blasphemy
but
news
of
the
disappearance
of
the
jeweler
having
attracted
the
attention
of
the
whole
escolta
and
the
sacks
of
powder
and
great
quantities
of
cartridges
having
been
discovered
in
his
house
the
story
began
to
wear
an
appearance
of
truth
mystery
began
to
enwrap
the
affair
enveloping
it
in
clouds
there
were
whispered
conversations
coughs
suspicious
looks
suggestive
comments
and
trite
remarks
those
who
were
on
the
inside
were
unable
to
get
over
their
astonishment
they
put
on
long
faces
turned
pale
and
but
little
was
wanting
for
many
persons
to
lose
their
minds
in
realizing
certain
things
that
had
before
passed
unnoticed
we
had
a
narrow
escape
who
would
have
said
in
the
afternoon
his
pockets
filled
with
revolvers
and
cartridges
went
to
see
don
custodio
whom
he
found
hard
at
work
over
a
project
against
american
jewelers
in
a
hushed
voice
he
whispered
between
the
palms
of
his
hands
into
the
journalist
ear
mysterious
words
really
questioned
slapping
his
hand
on
his
pocket
and
paling
visibly
wherever
he
may
be
found
the
sentence
was
completed
with
an
expressive
pantomime
don
custodio
raised
both
arms
to
the
height
of
his
face
with
the
right
more
bent
than
the
left
turned
the
palms
of
his
hands
toward
the
floor
closed
one
eye
and
made
two
movements
in
advance
ssh
ssh
he
hissed
and
the
diamonds
inquired
if
they
find
him
he
went
through
another
pantomime
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
spreading
them
out
and
clenching
them
together
like
the
closing
of
a
fan
clutching
out
with
them
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
the
wings
of
a
sweeping
imaginary
objects
toward
itself
with
practised
skill
responded
with
another
pantomime
opening
his
eyes
wide
arching
his
eyebrows
and
sucking
in
his
breath
eagerly
as
though
nutritious
air
had
just
been
discovered
sssh
chapter

the
mystery
todo
se
sabe
notwithstanding
so
many
precautions
rumors
reached
the
public
even
though
quite
changed
and
mutilated
on
the
following
night
they
were
the
theme
of
comment
in
the
house
of
orenda
a
rich
jewel
merchant
in
the
industrious
district
of
santa
cruz
and
the
numerous
friends
of
the
family
gave
attention
to
nothing
else
they
were
not
indulging
in
cards
or
playing
the
piano
while
little
tinay
the
youngest
of
the
girls
became
bored
playing
by
herself
without
being
able
to
understand
the
interest
awakened
by
assaults
conspiracies
and
sacks
of
powder
when
there
were
in
the
seven
holes
so
many
beautiful
cowries
that
seemed
to
be
winking
at
her
in
unison
and
smiled
with
their
tiny
mouths
begging
to
be
carried
up
to
the
even
isagani
who
when
he
came
always
used
to
play
with
her
and
allow
himself
to
be
beautifully
cheated
did
not
come
at
her
call
for
isagani
was
gloomily
and
silently
listening
to
something
chichoy
the
silversmith
was
relating
momoy
the
betrothed
of
sensia
the
eldest
of
the
daughters
a
pretty
and
vivacious
girl
rather
given
to
joking
had
left
the
window
where
he
was
accustomed
to
spend
his
evenings
in
amorous
discourse
and
this
action
seemed
to
be
very
annoying
to
the
lory
whose
cage
hung
from
the
eaves
there
the
lory
endeared
to
the
house
from
its
ability
to
greet
everybody
in
the
morning
with
marvelous
phrases
of
love
capitana
loleng
the
energetic
and
intelligent
capitana
loleng
had
her
open
before
her
but
she
neither
read
nor
wrote
in
it
nor
was
her
attention
fixed
on
the
trays
of
loose
pearls
nor
on
the
diamonds
she
had
completely
forgotten
herself
and
was
all
ears
her
husband
himself
the
great
capitan
toringoy
a
transformation
of
the
name
domingo
the
happiest
man
in
the
district
without
other
occupation
than
to
dress
well
eat
loaf
and
gossip
while
his
whole
family
worked
and
toiled
had
not
gone
to
join
his
coterie
but
was
listening
between
fear
and
emotion
to
the
news
of
the
lank
chichoy
nor
was
reason
for
all
this
lacking
chichoy
had
gone
to
deliver
some
work
for
don
timoteo
pelaez
a
pair
of
earrings
for
the
bride
at
the
very
time
when
they
were
tearing
down
the
kiosk
that
on
the
previous
night
had
served
as
a
for
the
foremost
officials
here
chichoy
turned
pale
and
his
hair
stood
on
end
he
exclaimed
sacks
and
sacks
of
powder
sacks
of
powder
under
the
floor
in
the
roof
under
the
table
under
the
chairs
everywhere
it
lucky
none
of
the
workmen
were
smoking
who
put
those
sacks
of
powder
there
asked
capitana
loleng
who
was
brave
and
did
not
turn
pale
as
did
the
enamored
momoy
but
momoy
had
attended
the
wedding
so
his
posthumous
emotion
can
be
appreciated
he
had
been
near
the
kiosk
that
what
no
one
can
explain
replied
chichoy
who
would
have
any
interest
in
breaking
up
the
fiesta
there
could
have
been
more
than
one
as
the
celebrated
lawyer
señor
pasta
who
was
there
on
a
visit
declared
either
an
enemy
of
don
timoteo
or
a
rival
of
juanito
the
orenda
girls
turned
instinctively
toward
isagani
who
smiled
silently
hide
yourself
capitana
loleng
advised
him
they
may
accuse
you
hide
again
isagani
smiled
but
said
nothing
don
timoteo
continued
chichoy
did
not
know
to
whom
to
attribute
the
deed
he
himself
superintended
the
work
he
and
his
friend
simoun
and
nobody
else
the
house
was
thrown
into
an
uproar
the
lieutenant
of
the
guard
came
and
after
enjoining
secrecy
upon
everybody
they
sent
me
away
but
but
but
stammered
the
trembling
momoy
ejaculated
sensia
gazing
at
her
fiancé
and
trembling
sympathetically
to
remember
that
he
had
been
at
the
fiesta
this
young
man
if
the
house
had
blown
up
she
stared
at
her
sweetheart
passionately
and
admired
his
courage
if
it
had
blown
up
no
one
in
the
whole
of
calle
anloague
would
have
been
left
alive
concluded
capitan
toringoy
feigning
valor
and
indifference
in
the
presence
of
his
family
i
left
in
consternation
resumed
chichoy
thinking
about
how
if
a
mere
spark
a
cigarette
had
fallen
if
a
lamp
had
been
overturned
at
the
present
moment
we
should
have
neither
a
general
nor
an
archbishop
nor
any
one
not
even
a
government
clerk
all
who
were
at
the
fiesta
last
night
annihilated
santísima
this
young
man
exclaimed
capitana
loleng
all
our
debtors
were
there
and
we
have
a
house
near
there
who
could
it
have
been
now
you
may
know
about
it
added
chichoy
in
a
whisper
but
you
must
keep
it
a
secret
this
afternoon
i
met
a
friend
a
clerk
in
an
office
and
in
talking
about
the
affair
he
gave
me
the
clue
to
the
mystery
he
had
it
from
some
government
employees
who
do
you
suppose
put
the
sacks
of
powder
there
many
shrugged
their
shoulders
while
capitan
toringoy
merely
looked
askance
at
isagani
the
friars
quiroga
the
chinaman
some
student
makaraig
capitan
toringoy
coughed
and
glanced
at
isagani
while
chichoy
shook
his
head
and
smiled
the
jeweler
simoun
simoun
the
profound
silence
of
amazement
followed
these
words
simoun
the
evil
genius
of
the
the
rich
trader
to
whose
house
they
had
gone
to
buy
unset
gems
simoun
who
had
received
the
orenda
girls
with
great
courtesy
and
had
paid
them
fine
compliments
for
the
very
reason
that
the
story
seemed
absurd
it
was
believed
quia
absurdum
said
augustine
but
was
simoun
at
the
fiesta
last
night
asked
sensia
yes
said
momoy
but
now
i
remember
he
left
the
house
just
as
we
were
sitting
down
to
the
dinner
he
went
to
get
his
but
was
he
a
friend
of
the
general
was
he
a
partner
of
don
timoteo
yes
he
made
himself
a
partner
in
order
to
strike
the
blow
and
kill
all
the
spaniards
aha
cried
sensia
now
i
understand
what
you
did
want
to
believe
aunt
tentay
simoun
is
the
devil
and
he
has
bought
up
the
souls
of
all
the
spaniards
aunt
tentay
said
so
capitana
loleng
crossed
herself
and
looked
uneasily
toward
the
jewels
fearing
to
see
them
turn
into
live
coals
while
capitan
toringoy
took
off
the
ring
which
had
come
from
simoun
simoun
has
disappeared
without
leaving
any
traces
added
chichoy
the
civil
guard
is
searching
for
him
yes
observed
sensia
crossing
herself
searching
for
the
devil
now
many
things
were
explained
simoun
fabulous
wealth
and
the
peculiar
smell
in
his
house
the
smell
of
sulphur
binday
another
of
the
daughters
a
frank
and
lovely
girl
remembered
having
seen
blue
flames
in
the
jeweler
house
one
afternoon
when
she
and
her
mother
had
gone
there
to
buy
jewels
isagani
listened
attentively
but
said
nothing
so
last
night
ventured
momoy
last
night
echoed
sensia
between
curiosity
and
fear
momoy
hesitated
but
the
face
sensia
put
on
banished
his
fear
last
night
while
we
were
eating
there
was
a
disturbance
the
light
in
the
general
went
out
they
say
that
some
unknown
person
stole
the
lamp
that
was
presented
by
simoun
a
thief
one
of
the
black
hand
isagani
arose
to
walk
back
and
forth
did
they
catch
him
he
jumped
into
the
river
before
anybody
recognized
him
some
say
he
was
a
spaniard
some
a
chinaman
and
others
an
indian
it
believed
that
with
the
lamp
added
chichoy
he
was
going
to
set
fire
to
the
house
then
the
powder
momoy
again
shuddered
but
noticing
that
sensia
was
watching
him
tried
to
control
himself
what
a
pity
he
exclaimed
with
an
effort
how
wickedly
the
thief
acted
everybody
would
have
been
killed
sensia
stared
at
him
in
fright
the
women
crossed
themselves
while
capitan
toringoy
who
was
afraid
of
politics
made
a
move
to
go
away
momoy
turned
to
isagani
who
observed
with
an
enigmatic
smile
always
wicked
to
take
what
does
belong
to
you
if
that
thief
had
known
what
it
was
all
about
and
had
been
able
to
reflect
surely
he
would
have
done
as
he
did
then
after
a
pause
he
added
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
i
want
to
be
in
his
place
so
they
continued
their
comments
and
conjectures
until
an
hour
later
when
isagani
bade
the
family
farewell
to
return
forever
to
his
uncle
side
chapter
xxxviii
fatality
was
the
terror
of
luzon
his
band
had
as
lief
appear
in
one
province
where
it
was
least
expected
as
make
a
descent
upon
another
that
was
preparing
to
resist
it
it
burned
a
in
batangas
and
destroyed
the
crops
on
the
following
day
it
murdered
the
justice
of
the
peace
of
tiani
and
on
the
next
took
possession
of
the
town
of
cavite
carrying
off
the
arms
from
the
town
hall
the
central
provinces
from
tayabas
to
pangasinan
suffered
from
his
depredations
and
his
bloody
name
extended
from
albay
in
the
south
to
kagayan
in
the
north
the
towns
disarmed
through
mistrust
on
the
part
of
a
weak
government
fell
easy
prey
into
his
hands
at
his
approach
the
fields
were
abandoned
by
the
farmers
the
herds
were
scattered
while
a
trail
of
blood
and
fire
marked
his
passage
laughed
at
the
severe
measures
ordered
by
the
government
against
the
tulisanes
since
from
them
only
the
people
in
the
outlying
villages
suffered
being
captured
and
maltreated
if
they
resisted
the
band
and
if
they
made
peace
with
it
being
flogged
and
deported
by
the
government
provided
they
completed
the
journey
and
did
not
meet
with
a
fatal
accident
on
the
way
thanks
to
these
terrible
alternatives
many
of
the
country
folk
decided
to
enlist
under
his
command
as
a
result
of
this
reign
of
terror
trade
among
the
towns
already
languishing
died
out
completely
the
rich
dared
not
travel
and
the
poor
feared
to
be
arrested
by
the
civil
guard
which
being
under
obligation
to
pursue
the
tulisanes
often
seized
the
first
person
encountered
and
subjected
him
to
unspeakable
tortures
in
its
impotence
the
government
put
on
a
show
of
energy
toward
the
persons
whom
it
suspected
in
order
that
by
force
of
cruelty
the
people
should
not
realize
its
weakness
the
fear
that
prompted
such
measures
a
string
of
these
hapless
suspects
some
six
or
seven
with
their
arms
tied
behind
them
bound
together
like
a
bunch
of
human
meat
was
one
afternoon
marching
through
the
excessive
heat
along
a
road
that
skirted
a
mountain
escorted
by
ten
or
twelve
guards
armed
with
rifles
their
bayonets
gleamed
in
the
sun
the
barrels
of
their
rifles
became
hot
and
even
the
in
their
helmets
scarcely
served
to
temper
the
effect
of
the
deadly
may
sun
deprived
of
the
use
of
their
arms
and
pressed
close
against
one
another
to
save
rope
the
prisoners
moved
along
almost
uncovered
and
unshod
he
being
the
best
off
who
had
a
handkerchief
twisted
around
his
head
panting
suffering
covered
with
dust
which
perspiration
converted
into
mud
they
felt
their
brains
melting
they
saw
lights
dancing
before
them
red
spots
floating
in
the
air
exhaustion
and
dejection
were
pictured
in
their
faces
desperation
wrath
something
indescribable
the
look
of
one
who
dies
cursing
of
a
man
who
is
weary
of
life
who
hates
himself
who
blasphemes
against
god
the
strongest
lowered
their
heads
to
rub
their
faces
against
the
dusky
backs
of
those
in
front
of
them
and
thus
wipe
away
the
sweat
that
was
blinding
them
many
were
limping
but
if
any
one
of
them
happened
to
fall
and
thus
delay
the
march
he
would
hear
a
curse
as
a
soldier
ran
up
brandishing
a
branch
torn
from
a
tree
and
forced
him
to
rise
by
striking
about
in
all
directions
the
string
then
started
to
run
dragging
rolling
in
the
dust
the
fallen
one
who
howled
and
begged
to
be
killed
but
perchance
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
his
feet
and
then
went
along
crying
like
a
child
and
cursing
the
hour
he
was
born
the
human
cluster
halted
at
times
while
the
guards
drank
and
then
the
prisoners
continued
on
their
way
with
parched
mouths
darkened
brains
and
hearts
full
of
curses
thirst
was
for
these
wretches
the
least
of
their
troubles
move
on
you
sons
of
cried
a
soldier
again
refreshed
hurling
the
insult
common
among
the
lower
classes
of
filipinos
the
branch
whistled
and
fell
on
any
shoulder
whatsoever
the
nearest
one
or
at
times
upon
a
face
to
leave
a
welt
at
first
white
then
red
and
later
dirty
with
the
dust
of
the
road
move
on
you
cowards
at
times
a
voice
yelled
in
spanish
deepening
its
tone
cowards
repeated
the
mountain
echoes
then
the
cowards
quickened
their
pace
under
a
sky
of
iron
over
a
burning
road
lashed
by
the
knotty
branch
which
was
worn
into
shreds
on
their
livid
skins
a
siberian
winter
would
perhaps
be
tenderer
than
the
may
sun
of
the
philippines
yet
among
the
soldiers
there
was
one
who
looked
with
disapproving
eyes
upon
so
much
wanton
cruelty
as
he
marched
along
silently
with
his
brows
knit
in
disgust
at
length
seeing
that
the
guard
not
satisfied
with
the
branch
was
kicking
the
prisoners
that
fell
he
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
but
cried
out
impatiently
here
mautang
let
them
alone
mautang
turned
toward
him
in
surprise
what
it
to
you
carolino
he
asked
to
me
nothing
but
it
hurts
me
replied
carolino
they
men
like
ourselves
it
plain
that
you
new
to
the
business
retorted
mautang
with
a
compassionate
smile
how
did
you
treat
the
prisoners
in
the
war
with
more
consideration
surely
answered
carolino
mautang
remained
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
apparently
having
discovered
the
reason
calmly
rejoined
ah
it
because
they
are
enemies
and
fight
us
while
these
these
are
our
own
countrymen
then
drawing
nearer
to
carolino
he
whispered
how
stupid
you
are
they
treated
so
in
order
that
they
may
attempt
to
resist
or
to
escape
and
then
bang
carolino
made
no
reply
one
of
the
prisoners
then
begged
that
they
let
him
stop
for
a
moment
this
is
a
dangerous
place
answered
the
corporal
gazing
uneasily
toward
the
mountain
move
on
move
on
echoed
mautang
and
his
lash
whistled
the
prisoner
twisted
himself
around
to
stare
at
him
with
reproachful
eyes
you
are
more
cruel
than
the
spaniard
himself
he
said
mautang
replied
with
more
blows
when
suddenly
a
bullet
whistled
followed
by
a
loud
report
mautang
dropped
his
rifle
uttered
an
oath
and
clutching
at
his
breast
with
both
hands
fell
spinning
into
a
heap
the
prisoner
saw
him
writhing
in
the
dust
with
blood
spurting
from
his
mouth
halt
called
the
corporal
suddenly
turning
pale
the
soldiers
stopped
and
stared
about
them
a
wisp
of
smoke
rose
from
a
thicket
on
the
height
above
another
bullet
sang
to
its
accompanying
report
and
the
corporal
wounded
in
the
thigh
doubled
over
vomiting
curses
the
column
was
attacked
by
men
hidden
among
the
rocks
above
sullen
with
rage
the
corporal
motioned
toward
the
string
of
prisoners
and
laconically
ordered
fire
the
wretches
fell
upon
their
knees
filled
with
consternation
as
they
could
not
lift
their
hands
they
begged
for
mercy
by
kissing
the
dust
or
bowing
their
heads
one
talked
of
his
children
another
of
his
mother
who
would
be
left
unprotected
one
promised
money
another
called
upon
god
but
the
muzzles
were
quickly
lowered
and
a
hideous
volley
silenced
them
all
then
began
the
sharpshooting
against
those
who
were
behind
the
rocks
above
over
which
a
light
cloud
of
smoke
began
to
hover
to
judge
from
the
scarcity
of
their
shots
the
invisible
enemies
could
not
have
more
than
three
rifles
as
they
advanced
firing
the
guards
sought
cover
behind
or
crouched
down
as
they
attempted
to
scale
the
height
splintered
rocks
leaped
up
broken
twigs
fell
from
trees
patches
of
earth
were
torn
up
and
the
first
guard
who
attempted
the
ascent
rolled
back
with
a
bullet
through
his
shoulder
the
hidden
enemy
had
the
advantage
of
position
but
the
valiant
guards
who
did
not
know
how
to
flee
were
on
the
point
of
retiring
for
they
had
paused
unwilling
to
advance
that
fight
against
the
invisible
unnerved
them
smoke
and
rocks
alone
could
be
seen
not
a
voice
was
heard
not
a
shadow
appeared
they
seemed
to
be
fighting
with
the
mountain
shoot
carolino
what
are
you
aiming
at
called
the
corporal
at
that
instant
a
man
appeared
upon
a
rock
making
signs
with
his
rifle
shoot
him
ordered
the
corporal
with
a
foul
oath
three
guards
obeyed
the
order
but
the
man
continued
standing
there
calling
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
something
unintelligible
carolino
paused
thinking
that
he
recognized
something
familiar
about
that
figure
which
stood
out
plainly
in
the
sunlight
but
the
corporal
threatened
to
tie
him
up
if
he
did
not
fire
so
carolino
took
aim
and
the
report
of
his
rifle
was
heard
the
man
on
the
rock
spun
around
and
disappeared
with
a
cry
that
left
carolino
then
followed
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
indicating
that
those
within
were
scattering
in
all
directions
so
the
soldiers
boldly
advanced
now
that
there
was
no
more
resistance
another
man
appeared
upon
the
rock
waving
a
spear
and
they
fired
at
him
he
sank
down
slowly
catching
at
the
branch
of
a
tree
but
with
another
volley
fell
face
downwards
on
the
rock
the
guards
climbed
on
nimbly
with
bayonets
fixed
ready
for
a
fight
carolino
alone
moved
forward
reluctantly
with
a
wandering
gloomy
look
the
cry
of
the
man
struck
by
his
bullet
still
ringing
in
his
ears
the
first
to
reach
the
spot
found
an
old
man
dying
stretched
out
on
the
rock
he
plunged
his
bayonet
into
the
body
but
the
old
man
did
not
even
wink
his
eyes
being
fixed
on
carolino
with
an
indescribable
gaze
while
with
his
bony
hand
he
pointed
to
something
behind
the
rock
the
soldiers
turned
to
see
caroline
frightfully
pale
his
mouth
hanging
open
with
a
look
in
which
glimmered
the
last
spark
of
reason
for
carolino
who
was
no
other
than
tano
cabesang
tales
son
and
who
had
just
returned
from
the
carolines
recognized
in
the
dying
man
his
grandfather
tandang
selo
no
longer
able
to
speak
the
old
man
dying
eyes
uttered
a
whole
poem
of
grief
and
then
a
corpse
he
still
continued
to
point
to
something
behind
the
rock
chapter
xxxix
conclusion
in
his
solitary
retreat
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
whose
mobile
surface
was
visible
through
the
open
windows
extending
outward
until
it
mingled
with
the
horizon
padre
florentino
was
relieving
the
monotony
by
playing
on
his
harmonium
sad
and
melancholy
tunes
to
which
the
sonorous
roar
of
the
surf
and
the
sighing
of
the
treetops
of
the
neighboring
wood
served
as
accompaniments
notes
long
full
mournful
as
a
prayer
yet
still
vigorous
escaped
from
the
old
instrument
padre
florentino
who
was
an
accomplished
musician
was
improvising
and
as
he
was
alone
gave
free
rein
to
the
sadness
in
his
heart
for
the
truth
was
that
the
old
man
was
very
sad
his
good
friend
don
tiburcio
de
espadaña
had
just
left
him
fleeing
from
the
persecution
of
his
wife
that
morning
he
had
received
a
note
from
the
lieutenant
of
the
civil
guard
which
ran
thus
my
dear
chaplain
i
have
just
received
from
the
commandant
a
telegram
that
says
spaniard
hidden
house
padre
florentino
capture
forward
alive
dead
as
the
telegram
is
quite
explicit
warn
your
friend
not
to
be
there
when
i
come
to
arrest
him
at
eight
tonight
affectionately
perez
burn
this
note
don
tiburcio
had
stammered
of
having
me
padre
florentino
was
unable
to
reassure
him
vainly
he
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
word
should
have
read
and
that
the
hidden
spaniard
could
not
be
don
tiburcio
but
the
jeweler
simoun
who
two
days
before
had
arrived
wounded
and
a
fugitive
begging
for
shelter
but
don
tiburcio
would
not
be
convinced
was
his
own
lameness
his
personal
description
and
it
was
an
intrigue
of
victorina
to
get
him
back
alive
or
dead
as
isagani
had
written
from
manila
so
the
poor
ulysses
had
left
the
priest
house
to
conceal
himself
in
the
hut
of
a
woodcutter
no
doubt
was
entertained
by
padre
florentino
that
the
spaniard
wanted
was
the
jeweler
simoun
who
had
arrived
mysteriously
himself
carrying
the
bleeding
morose
and
exhausted
with
the
free
and
cordial
filipino
hospitality
the
priest
had
taken
him
in
without
asking
indiscreet
questions
and
as
news
of
the
events
in
manila
had
not
yet
reached
his
ears
he
was
unable
to
understand
the
situation
clearly
the
only
conjecture
that
occurred
to
him
was
that
the
general
the
jeweler
friend
and
protector
being
gone
probably
his
enemies
the
victims
of
wrong
and
abuse
were
now
rising
and
calling
for
vengeance
and
that
the
acting
governor
was
pursuing
him
to
make
him
disgorge
the
wealth
he
had
accumulated
hence
his
flight
but
whence
came
his
wounds
had
he
tried
to
commit
suicide
were
they
the
result
of
personal
revenge
or
were
they
merely
caused
by
an
accident
as
simoun
claimed
had
they
been
received
in
escaping
from
the
force
that
was
pursuing
him
this
last
conjecture
was
the
one
that
seemed
to
have
the
greatest
appearance
of
probability
being
further
strengthened
by
the
telegram
received
and
simoun
decided
unwillingness
from
the
start
to
be
treated
by
the
doctor
from
the
capital
the
jeweler
submitted
only
to
the
ministrations
of
don
tiburcio
and
even
to
them
with
marked
distrust
in
this
situation
padre
florentino
was
asking
himself
what
line
of
conduct
he
should
pursue
when
the
civil
guard
came
to
arrest
simoun
his
condition
would
not
permit
his
removal
much
less
a
long
journey
but
the
telegram
said
alive
or
dead
padre
florentine
ceased
playing
and
approached
the
window
to
gaze
out
at
the
sea
whose
desolate
surface
was
without
a
ship
without
a
sail
it
gave
him
no
suggestion
a
solitary
islet
outlined
in
the
distance
spoke
only
of
solitude
and
made
the
space
more
lonely
infinity
is
at
times
despairingly
mute
the
old
man
was
trying
to
analyze
the
sad
and
ironical
smile
with
which
simoun
had
received
the
news
that
he
was
to
be
arrested
what
did
that
smile
mean
and
that
other
smile
still
sadder
and
more
ironical
with
which
he
received
the
news
that
they
would
not
come
before
eight
at
night
what
did
all
this
mystery
signify
why
did
simoun
refuse
to
hide
there
came
into
his
mind
the
celebrated
saying
of
john
chrysostom
when
he
was
defending
the
eunuch
eutropius
never
was
a
better
time
than
this
to
say
vanity
of
vanities
and
all
is
vanity
yes
that
simoun
so
rich
so
powerful
so
feared
a
week
ago
and
now
more
unfortunate
than
eutropius
was
seeking
refuge
not
at
the
altars
of
a
church
but
in
the
miserable
house
of
a
poor
native
priest
hidden
in
the
forest
on
the
solitary
seashore
vanity
of
vanities
and
all
is
vanity
that
man
would
within
a
few
hours
be
a
prisoner
dragged
from
the
bed
where
he
lay
without
respect
for
his
condition
without
consideration
for
his
wounds
dead
or
alive
his
enemies
demanded
him
how
could
he
save
him
where
could
he
find
the
moving
accents
of
the
bishop
of
constantinople
what
weight
would
his
weak
words
have
the
words
of
a
native
priest
whose
own
humiliation
this
same
simoun
had
in
his
better
days
seemed
to
applaud
and
encourage
but
padre
florentine
no
longer
recalled
the
indifferent
reception
that
two
months
before
the
jeweler
had
accorded
to
him
when
he
had
tried
to
interest
him
in
favor
of
isagani
then
a
prisoner
on
account
of
his
imprudent
chivalry
he
forgot
the
activity
simoun
had
displayed
in
urging
paulita
marriage
which
had
plunged
isagani
into
the
fearful
misanthropy
that
was
worrying
his
uncle
he
forgot
all
these
things
and
thought
only
of
the
sick
man
plight
and
his
own
obligations
as
a
host
until
his
senses
reeled
where
must
he
hide
him
to
avoid
his
falling
into
the
clutches
of
the
authorities
but
the
person
chiefly
concerned
was
not
worrying
he
was
smiling
while
he
was
pondering
over
these
things
the
old
man
was
approached
by
a
servant
who
said
that
the
sick
man
wished
to
speak
with
him
so
he
went
into
the
next
room
a
clean
and
apartment
with
a
floor
of
wide
boards
smoothed
and
polished
and
simply
furnished
with
big
heavy
armchairs
of
ancient
design
without
varnish
or
paint
at
one
end
there
was
a
large
kamagon
bed
with
its
four
posts
to
support
the
canopy
and
beside
it
a
table
covered
with
bottles
lint
and
bandages
a
at
the
feet
of
a
christ
and
a
scanty
library
led
to
the
suspicion
that
it
was
the
priest
own
bedroom
given
up
to
his
guest
according
to
the
filipino
custom
of
offering
to
the
stranger
the
best
table
the
best
room
and
the
best
bed
in
the
house
upon
seeing
the
windows
opened
wide
to
admit
freely
the
healthful
and
the
echoes
of
its
eternal
lament
no
one
in
the
philippines
would
have
said
that
a
sick
person
was
to
be
found
there
since
it
is
the
custom
to
close
all
the
windows
and
stop
up
all
the
cracks
just
as
soon
as
any
one
catches
a
cold
or
gets
an
insignificant
headache
padre
florentine
looked
toward
the
bed
and
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
sick
man
face
had
lost
its
tranquil
and
ironical
expression
hidden
grief
seemed
to
knit
his
brows
anxiety
was
depicted
in
his
looks
his
lips
were
curled
in
a
smile
of
pain
are
you
suffering
señor
simoun
asked
the
priest
solicitously
going
to
his
side
some
but
in
a
little
while
i
shall
cease
to
suffer
he
replied
with
a
shake
of
his
head
padre
florentine
clasped
his
hands
in
fright
suspecting
that
he
understood
the
terrible
truth
my
god
what
have
you
done
what
have
you
taken
he
reached
toward
the
bottles
it
useless
now
there
no
remedy
at
all
answered
simoun
with
a
pained
smile
what
did
you
expect
me
to
do
before
the
clock
strikes
eight
alive
or
dead
dead
yes
but
alive
no
my
god
what
have
you
done
be
calm
urged
the
sick
man
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
what
done
is
done
i
must
not
fall
into
anybody
hands
my
secret
would
be
torn
from
me
do
get
excited
do
lose
your
head
useless
listen
the
night
is
coming
on
and
there
no
time
to
be
lost
i
must
tell
you
my
secret
and
intrust
to
you
my
last
request
i
must
lay
my
life
open
before
you
at
the
supreme
moment
i
want
to
lighten
myself
of
a
load
i
want
to
clear
up
a
doubt
of
mine
you
who
believe
so
firmly
in
god
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
there
is
a
god
but
an
antidote
señor
simoun
i
have
ether
chloroform
the
priest
began
to
search
for
a
flask
until
simoun
cried
impatiently
useless
it
useless
do
waste
time
i
go
away
with
my
secret
the
bewildered
priest
fell
down
at
his
desk
and
prayed
at
the
feet
of
the
christ
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
then
he
arose
serious
and
grave
as
if
he
had
received
from
his
god
all
the
force
all
the
dignity
all
the
authority
of
the
judge
of
consciences
moving
a
chair
to
the
head
of
the
bed
he
prepared
to
listen
at
the
first
words
simoun
murmured
when
he
told
his
real
name
the
old
priest
started
back
and
gazed
at
him
in
terror
whereat
the
sick
man
smiled
bitterly
taken
by
surprise
the
priest
was
not
master
of
himself
but
he
soon
recovered
and
covering
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
again
bent
over
to
listen
simoun
related
his
sorrowful
story
how
thirteen
years
before
he
had
returned
from
europe
filled
with
hopes
and
smiling
illusions
having
come
back
to
marry
a
girl
whom
he
loved
disposed
to
do
good
and
forgive
all
who
had
wronged
him
just
so
they
would
let
him
live
in
peace
but
it
was
not
so
a
mysterious
hand
involved
him
in
the
confusion
of
an
uprising
planned
by
his
enemies
name
fortune
love
future
liberty
all
were
lost
and
he
escaped
only
through
the
heroism
of
a
friend
then
he
swore
vengeance
with
the
wealth
of
his
family
which
had
been
buried
in
a
wood
he
had
fled
had
gone
to
foreign
lands
and
engaged
in
trade
he
took
part
in
the
war
in
cuba
aiding
first
one
side
and
then
another
but
always
profiting
there
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
general
then
a
major
whose
he
won
first
by
loans
of
money
and
afterwards
he
made
a
friend
of
him
by
the
knowledge
of
criminal
secrets
with
his
money
he
had
been
able
to
secure
the
general
appointment
and
once
in
the
philippines
he
had
used
him
as
a
blind
tool
and
incited
him
to
all
kinds
of
injustice
availing
himself
of
his
insatiable
lust
for
gold
the
confession
was
long
and
tedious
but
during
the
whole
of
it
the
confessor
made
no
further
sign
of
surprise
and
rarely
interrupted
the
sick
man
it
was
night
when
padre
florentino
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
arose
and
began
to
meditate
mysterious
darkness
flooded
the
room
so
that
the
moonbeams
entering
through
the
window
filled
it
with
vague
lights
and
vaporous
reflections
into
the
midst
of
the
silence
the
priest
voice
broke
sad
and
deliberate
but
consoling
god
will
forgive
you
señor
simoun
he
said
he
knows
that
we
are
fallible
he
has
seen
that
you
have
suffered
and
in
ordaining
that
the
chastisement
for
your
faults
should
come
as
death
from
the
very
ones
you
have
instigated
to
crime
we
can
see
his
infinite
mercy
he
has
frustrated
your
plans
one
by
one
the
best
conceived
first
by
the
death
of
maria
clara
then
by
a
lack
of
preparation
then
in
some
mysterious
way
let
us
bow
to
his
will
and
render
him
thanks
according
to
you
then
feebly
responded
the
sick
man
his
will
is
that
these
islands
should
continue
in
the
condition
in
which
they
suffer
finished
the
priest
seeing
that
the
other
hesitated
i
do
know
sir
i
ca
read
the
thought
of
the
inscrutable
i
know
that
he
has
not
abandoned
those
peoples
who
in
their
supreme
moments
have
trusted
in
him
and
made
him
the
judge
of
their
cause
i
know
that
his
arm
has
never
failed
when
justice
long
trampled
upon
and
every
recourse
gone
the
oppressed
have
taken
up
the
sword
to
fight
for
home
and
wife
and
children
for
their
inalienable
rights
which
as
the
german
poet
says
shine
ever
there
above
unextinguished
and
inextinguishable
like
the
eternal
stars
themselves
no
god
is
justice
he
can
not
abandon
his
cause
the
cause
of
liberty
without
which
no
justice
is
possible
why
then
has
he
denied
me
his
aid
asked
the
sick
man
in
a
voice
charged
with
bitter
complaint
because
you
chose
means
that
he
could
not
sanction
was
the
severe
reply
the
glory
of
saving
a
country
is
not
for
him
who
has
contributed
to
its
ruin
you
have
believed
that
what
crime
and
iniquity
have
defiled
and
deformed
another
crime
and
another
iniquity
can
purify
and
redeem
wrong
hate
never
produces
anything
but
monsters
and
crime
criminals
love
alone
realizes
wonderful
works
virtue
alone
can
save
no
if
our
country
has
ever
to
be
free
it
will
not
be
through
vice
and
crime
it
will
not
be
so
by
corrupting
its
sons
deceiving
some
and
bribing
others
no
redemption
presupposes
virtue
virtue
sacrifice
and
sacrifice
love
well
i
accept
your
explanation
rejoined
the
sick
man
after
a
pause
i
have
been
mistaken
but
because
i
have
been
mistaken
will
that
god
deny
liberty
to
a
people
and
yet
save
many
who
are
much
worse
criminals
than
i
am
what
is
my
mistake
compared
to
the
crimes
of
our
rulers
why
has
that
god
to
give
more
heed
to
my
iniquity
than
to
the
cries
of
so
many
innocents
why
has
he
not
stricken
me
down
and
then
made
the
people
triumph
why
does
he
let
so
many
worthy
and
just
ones
suffer
and
look
complacently
upon
their
tortures
the
just
and
the
worthy
must
suffer
in
order
that
their
ideas
may
be
known
and
extended
you
must
shake
or
shatter
the
vase
to
spread
its
perfume
you
must
smite
the
rock
to
get
the
spark
there
is
something
providential
in
the
persecutions
of
tyrants
señor
simoun
i
knew
it
murmured
the
sick
man
and
therefore
i
encouraged
the
tyranny
yes
my
friend
but
more
corrupt
influences
than
anything
else
were
spread
you
fostered
the
social
rottenness
without
sowing
an
idea
from
this
fermentation
of
vices
loathing
alone
could
spring
and
if
anything
were
born
overnight
it
would
be
at
best
a
mushroom
for
mushrooms
only
can
spring
spontaneously
from
filth
true
it
is
that
the
vices
of
the
government
are
fatal
to
it
they
cause
its
death
but
they
kill
also
the
society
in
whose
bosom
they
are
developed
an
immoral
government
presupposes
a
demoralized
people
a
conscienceless
administration
greedy
and
servile
citizens
in
the
settled
parts
outlaws
and
brigands
in
the
mountains
like
master
like
slave
like
government
like
country
a
brief
pause
ensued
broken
at
length
by
the
sick
man
voice
then
what
can
be
done
suffer
and
work
suffer
work
echoed
the
sick
man
bitterly
ah
it
easy
to
say
that
when
you
are
not
suffering
when
the
work
is
rewarded
if
your
god
demands
such
great
sacrifices
from
man
man
who
can
scarcely
count
upon
the
present
and
doubts
the
future
if
you
had
seen
what
i
have
the
miserable
the
wretched
suffering
unspeakable
tortures
for
crimes
they
have
not
committed
murdered
to
cover
up
the
faults
and
incapacity
of
others
poor
fathers
of
families
torn
from
their
homes
to
work
to
no
purpose
upon
highways
that
are
destroyed
each
day
and
seem
only
to
serve
for
sinking
families
into
want
ah
to
suffer
to
work
is
the
will
of
god
convince
them
that
their
murder
is
their
salvation
that
their
work
is
the
prosperity
of
the
home
to
suffer
to
work
what
god
is
that
a
very
just
god
señor
simoun
replied
the
priest
a
god
who
chastises
our
lack
of
faith
our
vices
the
little
esteem
in
which
we
hold
dignity
and
the
civic
virtues
we
tolerate
vice
we
make
ourselves
its
accomplices
at
times
we
applaud
it
and
it
is
just
very
just
that
we
suffer
the
consequences
that
our
children
suffer
them
it
is
the
god
of
liberty
señor
simoun
who
obliges
us
to
love
it
by
making
the
yoke
heavy
for
us
a
god
of
mercy
of
equity
who
while
he
chastises
us
betters
us
and
only
grants
prosperity
to
him
who
has
merited
it
through
his
efforts
the
school
of
suffering
tempers
the
arena
of
combat
strengthens
the
soul
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
our
liberty
will
be
secured
at
the
point
for
the
sword
plays
but
little
part
in
modern
affairs
but
that
we
must
secure
it
by
making
ourselves
worthy
of
it
by
exalting
the
intelligence
and
the
dignity
of
the
individual
by
loving
justice
right
and
greatness
even
to
the
extent
of
dying
for
them
and
when
a
people
reaches
that
height
god
will
provide
a
weapon
the
idols
will
be
shattered
the
tyranny
will
crumble
like
a
house
of
cards
and
liberty
will
shine
out
like
the
first
dawn
our
ills
we
owe
to
ourselves
alone
so
let
us
blame
no
one
if
spain
should
see
that
we
were
less
complaisant
with
tyranny
and
more
disposed
to
struggle
and
suffer
for
our
rights
spain
would
be
the
first
to
grant
us
liberty
because
when
the
fruit
of
the
womb
reaches
maturity
woe
unto
the
mother
who
would
stifle
it
so
while
the
filipino
people
has
not
sufficient
energy
to
proclaim
with
head
erect
and
bosom
bared
its
rights
to
social
life
and
to
guarantee
it
with
its
sacrifices
with
its
own
blood
while
we
see
our
countrymen
in
private
life
ashamed
within
themselves
hear
the
voice
of
conscience
roar
in
rebellion
and
protest
yet
in
public
life
keep
silence
or
even
echo
the
words
of
him
who
abuses
them
in
order
to
mock
the
abused
while

drawn
from

at

asking

returned
to

motionless
his

closed

that

lying

noticing
that
he
was
not

touched
him
gently
and
then
realized
that

was
dead
his
body

already
commenced

upon

there

saw

billows
of

beating
into

hollows
of
the
cliff
producing
sonorous
thunder
at
the
same
time
that
smitten
by
the
moonbeams
the
waves
and
foam
glittered
like
sparks
of
fire
like
handfuls
of
diamonds
hurled
into
the
air
by
some
jinnee
of

abyss
he
gazed
about
him
he
was
alone

solitary
coast
was
lost
in

distance
amid

dim
cloud
that
the
moonbeams
played
through
until

mingled
with
the
horizon
the
forest
murmured
unintelligible
sounds
then
the
old
man
with
an
effort
of
his
herculean
arms
hurled
the
chest
into
space
throwing
it
toward
the
sea
it
whirled
over
and
over
several
times
and
descended
rapidly
in
a
slight
curve
reflecting
the
moonlight
on
its
polished
surface
the
old
man
saw
the
drops
of
water
fly
and
heard
a
loud
splash
as
the
abyss
closed
over
and
swallowed
up
the
treasure
he
waited
for
a
few
moments
to
see
if
the
depths
would
restore
anything
but
the
wave
rolled
on
as
mysteriously
as

without
adding

surface
