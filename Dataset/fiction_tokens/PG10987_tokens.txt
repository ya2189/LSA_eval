sobbed
little
henry
a
sweet
child
of
three
years
old
as
he
stood
in
the
lawn
opposite
the
door
with
the
wind
blowing
his
pretty
hair
and
clothes
all
about
him

and

after

a
big
pig
that
there
under
the
tree
all
bloody
with
long
ears
and
cocked
tail
will
eat
her
run
my
boy
right
run
now
run
poor
little
henry
much
more
alarmed
for
his
mamma
than
for
himself
flew
into
the
wood
with
the
hope
of
saving
her
and
having
run
a
good
way
without
stopping
calling
all
the
time
for
his
dear
mamma
he
tripped
against
a
tree
and
fell
but
quickly
recovering
he
stood
up
and
continued
his
race
till
quite
exhausted
he
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
there
continued
panting
and
crying
bitterly
at
last
he
turned
round
and
what
should
he
see
to
his
great
joy
but
his
favourite
dog
fidelle
o
fidelle
fidelle
said
the
baby
hugging
his
little
arms
round
the
dog
neck
o
where
mamma
and
papa
and
where
nurse
where
fidelle
can
not
you
tell
me
where
but
having
received
no
answer
he
stood
up
and
again
commenced
his
journey
and
fidelle
ran
on
before
and
it
was
astonishing
what
a
length
of
way
the
baby
walked
till
at
last
he
came
to
the
foot
of
a
high
mountain
and
now
night
came
on
and
the
wind
blew
strong
and
cold
and
little
henry
quite
bewildered
turned
into
a
narrow
path
shaded
by
oak
and
elm
and
sycamore
trees
and
the
baby
again
tripped
against
the
root
of
one
of
them
and
fell
and
his
little
hand
came
against
a
stone
and
he
was
much
hurt
and
his
heart
beat
and
the
tears
streamed
down
one
of
the
prettiest
little
faces
that
ever
was
seen
and
the
wind
blew
his
pretty
hair
off
his
forehead
and
it
would
go
to
your
very
heart
to
hear
his
little
mournful
cry
calling
out
for
his
mamma
his
own
dear
mamma
illustration
at
length
the
moon
arose
in
great
splendour
and
little
henry
saw
at
a
distance
an
old
abbey
all
covered
with
ivy
and
looking
so
dark
and
dismal
it
would
frighten
any
one
from
going
in
but
henry
little
heart
occupied
by
the
idea
of
his
mamma
and
with
grief
that
he
could
not
find
her
felt
no
fear
but
walking
in
he
saw
a
cell
in
the
corner
that
looked
like
a
and
with
fidelle
by
his
side
he
bent
his
little
steps
towards
it
and
seating
himself
on
a
stone
he
leaned
his
pretty
head
against
the
old
wall
and
fell
fast
asleep
illustration
overcome
with
fatigue
the
sweet
baby
slept
soundly
till
morning
but
when
he
awoke
fidelle
was
gone
and
he
felt
very
hungry
and
he
again
set
up
his
little
cry
oh
mamma
mamma
where
is
you
mamma
oh
i
want
my
breakfast
i
want
my
breakfast
at
length
he
spied
fidelle
cantering
in
with
something
in
her
mouth
and
having
laid
it
by
henry
side
she
darted
out
of
the
abbey
henry
took
it
up
it
was
a
large
piece
of
white
bread
which
the
faithful
creature
had
met
with
somewhere
and
brought
to
her
little
favourite
footnote
a
fact
you
may
suppose
how
happy
the
poor
child
was
to
get
it
and
while
he
was
eating
it
a
grey
owl
marched
from
her
nest
in
the
wall
and
began
picking
up
the
crumbs
this
greatly
amused
little
henry
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
there
came
a
great
set
of
sparrows
and
a
and
two
of
them
began
to
fight
and
this
made
henry
laugh
and
on
the
whole
they
so
occupied
him
all
day
he
was
less
unhappy
than
the
day
before
and
when
night
came
he
lay
down
near
the
nest
of
the
owl
and
her
young
ones
and
slept
soundly
next
day
faithful
fidelle
again
appeared
with
a
piece
of
boiled
beef
in
her
mouth
which
having
left
at
henry
feet
she
scampered
off
and
henry
ate
heartily
and
gave
some
to
the
owls
and
when
he
could
forget
his
mamma
which
indeed
was
not
often
these
birds
used
to
amuse
his
little
mind
but
towards
evening
getting
very
thirsty
he
again
began
to
cry
and
to
call
for
mamma
and
god
who
watches
over
little
infants
just
the
same
as
if
they
were
grown
men
put
it
into
his
little
heart
to
walk
outside
the
abbey
where
was
a
nice
stream
running
through
the
grass
and
the
baby
recollecting
he
had
seen
a
boy
the
week
before
lying
on
the
ground
drinking
out
of
a
stream
near
papa
house
knelt
down
and
took
a
hearty
drink
of
the
clear
water
illustration
and
now
near
a
week
passed
over
fidelle
constantly
bringing
a
supply
of
food
and
the
owls
and
the
sparrows
and
the
robin
sharing
the
welcome
morsel
and
affording
henry
little
mind
constant
amusement
and
occupation
at
length
the
little
birds
began
not
to
be
afraid
of
henry
and
they
would
come
and
hop
by
his
side
and
pick
up
the
crumbs
and
almost
eat
from
his
hand
and
one
of
them
built
its
nest
close
to
him
and
laid
two
eggs
and
every
evening
would
sing
such
a
sweet
song
that
really
the
baby
began
to
get
reconciled
and
used
to
feel
like
a
little
king
among
them
all
and
now
we
must
leave
our
mighty
for
a
while
and
return
to
his
disconsolate
parents
illustration
the
evening
bill
boldface
had
met
him
and
sent
him
so
cruelly
into
the
wood
mamma
was
out
walking
and
on
her
return
enquired
for
the
baby
o
said
papa
he
is
safe
i
saw
him
in
nurse
arms
a
few
minutes
ago
mamma
immediately
went
up
to
the
nursery
and
there
heard
that
nurse
had
gone
off
to
see
her
sister
who
lived
about
two
miles
distant
and
of
course
said
the
she
has
taken
master
henry
with
her
impressed
with
this
idea
mamma
returned
to
tea
but
when
night
came
she
began
to
get
very
uneasy
for
nurse
did
not
return
o
said
papa
you
know
she
often
remains
at
her
sister
and
though
she
has
done
very
wrong
in
keeping
the
baby
out
yet
she
is
so
fond
and
careful
of
him
we
need
not
be
uneasy
but
what
was
their
distraction
when
morning
came
nurse
returned
but
no
baby
the
whole
country
was
searched
the
ponds
and
lake
were
searched
every
spot
searched
but
the
very
place
the
baby
was
in
advertisements
were
put
in
all
the
papers
and
the
poor
father
and
mother
were
near
sinking
under
the
distraction
of
their
mind
unfeeling
bill
boldface
who
could
have
set
all
to
rights
had
sailed
off
to
america
the
very
morning
after
the
sweet
baby
had
disappeared
at
length
one
morning
the
distracted
father
perceived
fidelle
jumping
upon
the
table
and
seizing
a
large
piece
of
bread
fly
off
with
it
to
the
wood
the
lord
instantly
put
it
in
his
heart
to
follow
the
dog
who
led
him
into
the
abbey
and
there
surrounded
by
his
little
subjects
the
birds
fast
asleep
for
he
had
just
fallen
asleep
on
his
throne
lay
the
little
his
hand
was
placed
under
his
little
head
and
the
leaves
of
the
ivy
and
the
yew
were
all
scattered
about
him
my
child
my
child
said
the
poor
father
darting
forward
and
snatching
him
in
his
arms
is
my
henry
my
cherub
my
darling
o
gracious
god
is
it
indeed
my
child
illustration
the
voice
aroused
henry
and
flinging
his
little
arms
around
papa
neck
he
begged
to
be
taken
instantly
to
mamma
saying
as
his
happy
papa
carried
him
out
of
the
abbey
little
birds
i
come
back
and
bring
you
some
white
bread
but
now
i
must
go
see
mamma
little
birds
poor
mamma
when
she
saw
him
overcome
by
her
feelings
fainted
away
when
she
recovered
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
in
gratitude
to
god
for
thus
so
wonderfully
preserving
her
little
darling
and
now
my
children
pause
for
a
moment
and
reflect
on
the
goodness
of
god
so
powerfully
displayed
in
this
little
story
you
see
how
he
directed
fidelle
to
bring
food
for
the
support
of
this
little
baby
you
see
how
wonderfully
he
was
preserved
and
how
at
length
he
was
restored
to
his
parents
those
parents
were
truly
religious
and
their
prayers
were
heard
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
over
the
righteous
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
prayers
but
the
face
of
the
lord
is
against
them
that
do
pet
iii
o
my
children
love
god
and
make
christ
your
friend
and
then
they
will
watch
over
you
as
they
did
over
little
henry
and
when
you
die
they
will
take
you
up
to
live
with
themselves
and
you
shall
be
surrounded
by
the
happy
angels
in
heaven
perhaps
my
little
readers
may
like
to
hear
something
of
poor
fidelle
soon
after
her
visits
to
the
abbey
she
had
two
little
pups
one
of
them
died
but
the
other
henry
reared
with
the
greatest
tenderness
while
its
good
old
mother
beloved
and
even
respected
which
is
not
generally
the
case
with
dogs
by
all
the
family
lived
to
an
advanced
age
and
when
she
died
they
buried
her
in
the
garden
under
the
spreading
branches
of
an
old
sycamore
tree
little
henry
trained
in
the
love
and
fear
of
god
grew
up
one
of
the
best
of
children
every
where
he
went
the
blessing
of
god
was
with
him
for
christ
was
his
friend
and
when
little
henry
had
committed
a
fault
he
would
apply
to
his
kind
saviour
who
was
then
always
ready
to
procure
god
pardon
for
him
in
the
course
of
time
his
mamma
taught
him
the
following
little
poem

friend
of
my
childhood
and

of
my
youth

of
mercies
and
