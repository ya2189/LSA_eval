thanks
are
due
to
the
editors
of
and
for
permission
to
reproduce
most
of
the
stories
in
this
volume
preface
the
other
day
i
said
to
a
friend
i
have
just
been
reading
in
proof
a
volume
of
short
stories
by
an
author
named
richard
middleton
he
is
dead
it
is
an
extraordinary
book
and
all
the
work
in
it
is
full
of
a
quite
curious
and
distinctive
quality
in
my
opinion
it
is
very
fine
work
indeed
it
would
be
so
simple
if
the
business
of
the
introducer
or
were
limited
to
such
a
straightforward
honest
and
direct
expression
of
opinion
unfortunately
that
is
not
so
for
most
of
us
the
happier
ones
of
the
world
it
is
enough
to
say
i
like
it
or
i
do
like
it
and
there
is
an
end
the
critic
has
to
answer
the
everlasting
why
and
so
i
suppose
it
is
my
office
in
this
present
instance
to
say
why
i
like
the
collection
of
tales
that
follows
i
think
that
i
have
found
a
hint
as
to
the
right
answer
in
two
of
these
stories
one
is
called
the
story
of
a
book
the
other
the
biography
of
a
superman
each
is
rather
an
essay
than
a
tale
though
the
form
of
each
is
narrative
the
first
relates
the
sad
bewilderment
of
a
successful
novelist
who
feels
that
after
all
his
great
work
was
something
less
than
nothing
he
could
not
help
noticing
that
london
had
discovered
the
secret
which
made
his
intellectual
life
a
torment
the
streets
were
more
than
a
mere
assemblage
of
houses
london
herself
was
more
than
a
tangled
skein
of
streets
and
overhead
heaven
was
more
than
a
of
individual
stars
what
was
this
secret
that
made
words
into
a
book
houses
into
cities
and
restless
and
measurable
stars
into
an
unchanging
and
immeasurable
universe
then
from
the
biography
of
a
superman
i
select
this
very
striking
passage
possessed
of
an
intellect
of
great
analytic
and
destructive
force
he
was
almost
entirely
lacking
in
imagination
and
he
was
therefore
unable
to
raise
his
work
to
a
plane
in
which
the
mutually
combative
elements
of
his
nature
might
have
been
reconciled
his
light
moments
of
envy
anger
and
vanity
passed
into
the
crucible
to
come
forth
unchanged
he
lacked
the
magic
wand
and
his
work
never
took
wings
above
his
conception
now
compare
the
two
places
the
streets
were
more
than
a
mere
assemblage
of
houses
his
light
moments
passed
into
the
crucible
to
come
forth
unchanged
he
lacked
the
magic
wand
i
think
these
two
passages
indicate
the
answer
to
the
why
that
i
am
forced
to
resolve
show
something
of
the
secret
of
the
strange
charm
which
the
possesses
it
delights
because
it
is
significant
because
it
is
no
mere
assemblage
of
words
and
facts
and
observations
and
incidents
it
delights
because
its
matter
has
not
passed
through
the
crucible
unchanged
on
the
contrary
the
jumble
of
experiences
and
impressions
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
author
as
to
us
all
had
assuredly
been
placed
in
the
athanor
of
art
in
that
furnace
of
the
sages
which
is
said
to
be
governed
with
wisdom
lead
entered
the
burning
of
the
fire
gold
came
forth
from
it
this
analogy
of
the
process
of
alchemy
which
richard
middleton
has
himself
suggested
is
one
of
the
finest
and
the
fittest
for
our
purpose
but
there
are
many
others
the
magic
wand
analogy
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
there
is
the
like
notion
of
something
ugly
and
insignificant
changed
to
something
beautiful
and
significant
something
ugly
shall
we
not
say
rather
something
formless
transmuted
into
form
after
all
the
latin
dictionary
declares
solemnly
that
beauty
is
one
of
the
meanings
of
forma
and
here
we
are
away
from
alchemy
and
the
magic
wand
ideas
and
pass
to
the
thought
of
the
first
place
that
i
have
quoted
the
streets
were
more
than
a
mere
assemblage
of
houses
the
puzzle
is
solved
the
i
think
they
call
it
has
been
successfully
fitted
together
there
in
a
box
lay
all
the
jagged
irregular
pieces
each
in
itself
crazy
and
meaningless
and
irritating
by
its
very
lack
of
meaning
now
we
see
each
part
adapted
to
the
other
and
the
whole
is
one
picture
and
one
purpose
but
the
first
thing
necessary
to
this
achievement
is
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
puzzle
there
are
many
people
who
go
through
life
persuaded
that
there
is
a
puzzle
at
all
that
it
was
only
the
infancy
and
rude
childhood
of
the
world
which
dreamed
a
vain
dream
of
a
picture
to
be
made
out
of
the
jagged
bits
of
wood
there
never
has
been
a
picture
these
persons
say
and
there
never
will
be
a
picture
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
take
the
bits
out
of
the
box
look
at
them
and
put
them
back
again
or
returning
to
richard
middleton
excellent
example
there
is
no
such
thing
as
london
there
are
only
houses
no
man
has
seen
london
at
any
time
the
very
word
meaning
the
fort
on
the
lake
is
nonsensical
no
human
eye
has
ever
beheld
aught
else
but
a
number
of
houses
it
is
clear
that
this
london
is
as
mythical
and
monstrous
and
irrational
a
concept
as
many
others
of
the
same
class
well
people
who
talk
like
that
are
doubtless
sent
into
the
world
for
some
useful
but
mysterious
process
but
they
ca
write
real
books
richard
middleton
knew
that
there
was
a
puzzle
in
other
words
that
the
universe
is
a
great
mystery
and
this
consciousness
of
his
is
the
source
of
the
charm
of
the
ghost
ship
i
have
compared
this
orthodox
view
of
life
and
the
universe
and
the
fine
art
that
results
from
this
view
to
the
solving
of
a
puzzle
but
the
analogy
is
not
an
absolutely
perfect
one
for
if
you
buy
a
in
a
box
in
the
haymarket
you
take
it
home
with
you
and
begin
to
put
the
pieces
together
and
sooner
or
later
the
toil
is
over
and
the
difficulties
are
overcome
the
picture
is
clear
before
you
yes
the
toil
is
over
but
so
is
the
fun
it
is
but
poor
sport
to
do
the
trick
all
over
again
and
here
is
the
vast
inferiority
of
the
things
they
sell
in
the
shops
to
the
universe
our
great
puzzle
is
never
perfectly
solved
we
come
across
marvellous
hints
we
join
line
to
line
and
our
hearts
beat
with
the
rapture
of
a
great
surmise
we
follow
a
certain
track
and
know
by
sure
signs
and
signals
that
we
are
not
mistaken
that
we
are
on
the
right
road
we
are
furnished
with
certain
charts
which
tell
us
here
there
be
here
is
a
waste
place
here
a
high
hill
riseth
and
we
find
as
we
journey
that
so
it
is
but
happily
by
the
very
nature
of
the
case
we
can
never
put
the
whole
of
the
picture
together
we
can
never
recover
the
perfect
utterance
of
the
lost
word
we
can
never
say
here
is
the
end
of
all
the
journey
man
is
so
made
that
all
his
true
delight
arises
from
the
contemplation
of
mystery
and
save
by
his
own
frantic
and
invincible
folly
mystery
is
never
taken
from
him
it
rises
within
his
soul
a
well
of
joy
unending
hence
it
is
that
the
consciousness
of
this
mystery
resolved
into
the
form
of
art
expresses
itself
usually
or
always
by
symbols
by
the
part
put
for
the
whole
now
and
then
as
in
the
case
of
dante
as
it
was
with
the
great
of
the
holy
graal
we
have
a
sense
of
completeness
with
the
vision
of
the
angelic
rose
and
the
sentence
concerning
that
love
which
moves
the
sun
and
the
other
stars
there
is
the
shadow
of
a
catholic
survey
of
all
things
and
so
in
a
less
degree
it
is
as
we
read
of
the
translation
of
galahad
still
the
rose
and
the
graal
are
but
symbols
of
the
eternal
verities
not
those
verities
themselves
in
their
essences
and
in
these
later
days
when
we
have
become
clever
with
the
cleverness
of
the
performing
pig
it
is
a
great
thing
to
find
the
most
obscure
and
broken
indications
of
the
things
which
really
are
there
is
the
true
enchantment
of
true
romance
in
the
don
quixote
for
those
who
can
understand
but
it
is
delivered
in
the
mode
of
parody
and
burlesque
and
so
it
is
with
the
extraordinary
fantasy
the
which
gives
its
name
to
this
collection
of
tales
take
this
story
to
bits
as
it
were
analyse
it
you
will
be
astonished
at
its
frantic
absurdity
the
ghostly
galleon
blown
in
by
a
great
tempest
to
a
in
fairfield
a
little
village
lying
near
the
portsmouth
road
about
between
london
and
the
sea
the
farmer
grumbling
at
the
loss
of
so
many
turnips
the
captain
of
the
weird
vessel
acknowledging
the
justice
of
the
claim
and
tossing
a
great
gold
brooch
to
the
landlord
by
way
of
satisfying
the
debt
the
deplorable
fact
that
all
the
decent
village
ghosts
learned
to
riot
with
captain
bartholomew
roberts
the
visit
of
the
parson
and
his
godly
admonitions
to
the
captain
on
the
evil
work
he
was
doing
mere
craziness
you
will
say
yes
but
the
strange
thing
is
that
as
in
spite
of
all
jocose
tricks
and
misadventures
don
quixote
departs
from
us
with
a
great
light
shining
upon
him
so
this
of
richard
middleton
somehow
or
other
sails
and
anchors
and
in
an
unearthly
glow
and
captain
bartholomew
rum
that
was
like
hot
oil
and
honey
and
fire
in
the
veins
of
the
mortals
who
drank
of
it
has
become
for
me
one
of
the
of
story
and
thus
did
the
ship
put
forth
from
the
village
and
sail
away
in
a
great
tempest
of
wind
to
what
unimaginable
seas
of
the
spirit
the
wind
that
had
been
howling
outside
like
an
outrageous
dog
had
all
of
a
sudden
turned
as
melodious
as
the
of
a
christmas
eve
we
went
to
the
door
and
the
wind
burst
it
open
so
that
the
handle
was
driven
clean
into
the
plaster
of
the
wall
but
we
did
think
much
of
that
at
the
time
for
over
our
heads
sailing
very
comfortably
through
the
windy
stars
was
the
ship
that
had
passed
the
summer
in
landlord
field
her
portholes
and
her
were
blazing
with
lights
and
there
was
a
noise
of
singing
and
fiddling
on
her
decks
he
gone
shouted
landlord
above
the
storm
and
he
taken
half
the
village
with
him
i
could
only
nod
in
answer
not
having
lungs
like
bellows
of
leather
i
declare
i
would
not
exchange
this
short
crazy
enchanting
fantasy
for
a
whole
wilderness
of
seemly
novels
proclaiming
in
decorous
accents
the
undoubted
truth
that
there
are
milestones
on
the
portsmouth
road
arthur
machen
the
fairfield
is
a
little
village
lying
near
the
portsmouth
road
about
between
london
and
the
sea
strangers
who
find
it
by
accident
now
and
then
call
it
a
pretty
place
we
who
live
in
it
and
call
it
home
do
find
anything
very
pretty
about
it
but
we
should
be
sorry
to
live
anywhere
else
our
minds
have
taken
the
shape
of
the
inn
and
the
church
and
the
green
i
suppose
at
all
events
we
never
feel
comfortable
out
of
fairfield
of
course
the
cockneys
with
their
vasty
houses
and
streets
can
call
us
rustics
if
they
choose
but
for
all
that
fairfield
is
a
better
place
to
live
in
than
london
doctor
says
that
when
he
goes
to
london
his
mind
is
bruised
with
the
weight
of
the
houses
and
he
was
a
cockney
born
he
had
to
live
there
himself
when
he
was
a
little
chap
but
he
knows
better
now
you
gentlemen
may
laugh
perhaps
some
of
you
come
from
london
way
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
witness
like
that
is
worth
a
gallon
of
arguments
dull
well
you
might
find
it
dull
but
i
assure
you
that
listened
to
all
the
london
yarns
you
have
spun
tonight
and
absolutely
nothing
to
the
things
that
happen
at
fairfield
because
of
our
way
of
thinking
and
minding
our
own
business
if
one
of
your
londoners
were
set
down
on
the
green
of
a
saturday
night
when
the
ghosts
of
the
lads
who
died
in
the
war
keep
tryst
with
the
lasses
who
lie
in
the
he
could
help
being
curious
and
interfering
and
then
the
ghosts
would
go
somewhere
where
it
was
quieter
but
we
just
let
them
come
and
go
and
do
make
any
fuss
and
in
consequence
fairfield
is
the
ghostiest
place
in
all
england
why
i
seen
a
headless
man
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
well
in
broad
daylight
and
the
children
playing
about
his
feet
as
if
he
were
their
father
take
my
word
for
it
spirits
know
when
they
are
well
off
as
much
as
human
beings
still
i
must
admit
that
the
thing
i
going
to
tell
you
about
was
queer
even
for
our
part
of
the
world
where
three
packs
of
hunt
regularly
during
the
season
and
is
busy
all
night
shoeing
the
dead
horses
now
that
a
thing
that
would
happen
in
london
because
of
their
interfering
ways
but
blacksmith
he
lies
up
aloft
and
sleeps
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
once
when
he
had
a
bad
head
he
shouted
down
to
them
not
to
make
so
much
noise
and
in
the
morning
he
found
an
old
guinea
left
on
the
anvil
as
an
apology
he
wears
it
on
his
now
but
i
must
get
on
with
my
story
if
i
start
telling
you
about
the
queer
happenings
at
fairfield
i
never
stop
it
all
came
of
the
great
storm
in
the
spring
of
the
year
that
we
had
two
great
storms
this
was
the
first
one
and
i
remember
it
very
well
because
i
found
in
the
morning
that
it
had
lifted
the
thatch
of
my
pigsty
into
the
widow
garden
as
clean
as
a
boy
kite
when
i
looked
over
the
hedge
widow
tom
lamport
widow
that
was
was
prodding
for
her
nasturtiums
with
a
after
i
had
watched
her
for
a
little
i
went
down
to
the
fox
and
grapes
to
tell
landlord
what
she
had
said
to
me
landlord
he
laughed
being
a
married
man
and
at
ease
with
the
sex
come
to
that
he
said
the
tempest
has
blowed
something
into
my
field
a
kind
of
a
ship
i
think
it
would
be
i
was
surprised
at
that
until
he
explained
that
it
was
only
a
and
would
do
no
hurt
to
the
turnips
we
argued
that
it
had
been
blown
up
from
the
sea
at
portsmouth
and
then
we
talked
of
something
else
there
were
two
slates
down
at
the
parsonage
and
a
big
tree
in
lumley
meadow
it
was
a
rare
storm
i
reckon
the
wind
had
blown
our
ghosts
all
over
england
they
were
coming
back
for
days
afterwards
with
foundered
horses
and
as
footsore
as
possible
and
they
were
so
glad
to
get
back
to
fairfield
that
some
of
them
walked
up
the
street
crying
like
little
children
squire
said
that
his
had
looked
so
since
the
battle
of
naseby
and
he
an
educated
man
what
with
one
thing
and
another
i
should
think
it
was
a
week
before
we
got
straight
again
and
then
one
afternoon
i
met
the
landlord
on
the
green
and
he
had
a
worried
face
i
wish
you
come
and
have
a
look
at
that
ship
in
my
field
he
said
to
me
it
seems
to
me
leaning
real
hard
on
the
turnips
i
ca
bear
thinking
what
the
missus
will
say
when
she
sees
it
i
walked
down
the
lane
with
him
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
ship
in
the
middle
of
his
field
but
such
a
ship
as
no
man
had
seen
on
the
water
for
three
hundred
years
let
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
it
was
all
painted
black
and
covered
with
carvings
and
there
was
a
great
bay
window
in
the
stern
for
all
the
world
like
the
squire
there
was
a
crowd
of
little
black
cannon
on
deck
and
looking
out
of
her
and
she
was
anchored
at
each
end
to
the
hard
ground
i
have
seen
the
wonders
of
the
world
on
but
i
have
never
seen
anything
to
equal
that
she
seems
very
solid
for
a
i
said
seeing
the
landlord
was
bothered
i
should
say
it
a
betwixt
and
between
he
answered
puzzling
it
over
but
it
going
to
spoil
a
matter
of
fifty
turnips
and
missus
she
want
it
moved
we
went
up
to
her
and
touched
the
side
and
it
was
as
hard
as
a
real
ship
now
there
folks
in
england
would
call
that
very
curious
he
said
now
i
do
know
much
about
ships
but
i
should
think
that
that
weighed
a
solid
two
hundred
tons
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
had
come
to
stay
so
that
i
felt
sorry
for
landlord
who
was
a
married
man
all
the
horses
in
fairfield
wo
move
her
out
of
my
turnips
he
said
frowning
at
her
just
then
we
heard
a
noise
on
her
deck
and
we
looked
up
and
saw
that
a
man
had
come
out
of
her
front
cabin
and
was
looking
down
at
us
very
peaceably
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
uniform
set
out
with
rusty
gold
lace
and
he
had
a
great
cutlass
by
his
side
in
a
brass
sheath
captain
bartholomew
roberts
he
said
in
a
gentleman
voice
put
in
for
recruits
i
seem
to
have
brought
her
rather
far
up
the
harbour
harbour
cried
landlord
why
you
fifty
miles
from
the
sea
captain
roberts
did
turn
a
hair
so
much
as
that
is
it
he
said
coolly
well
it
of
no
consequence
landlord
was
a
bit
upset
at
this
i
do
want
to
be
unneighbourly
he
said
but
i
wish
you
had
brought
your
ship
into
my
field
you
see
my
wife
sets
great
store
on
these
turnips
the
captain
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
out
of
a
fine
gold
box
that
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
and
dusted
his
fingers
with
a
silk
handkerchief
in
a
very
genteel
fashion
i
only
here
for
a
few
months
he
said
but
if
a
testimony
of
my
esteem
would
pacify
your
good
lady
i
should
be
content
and
with
the
words
he
loosed
a
great
gold
brooch
from
the
neck
of
his
coat
and
tossed
it
down
to
landlord
landlord
blushed
as
red
as
a
strawberry
i
not
denying
she
fond
of
jewellery
he
said
but
it
too
much
for
half
a
sackful
of
turnips
and
indeed
it
was
a
handsome
brooch
the
captain
laughed
tut
man
he
said
it
a
forced
sale
and
you
deserve
a
good
price
say
no
more
about
it
and
nodding
to
us
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
into
the
cabin
landlord
walked
back
up
the
lane
like
a
man
with
a
weight
off
his
mind
that
tempest
has
blowed
me
a
bit
of
luck
he
said
the
missus
will
be
much
pleased
with
that
brooch
it
better
than
blacksmith
guinea
any
day
was
jubilee
year
the
year
of
the
second
jubilee
you
remember
and
we
had
great
doings
at
fairfield
so
that
we
much
time
to
bother
about
the
though
anyhow
it
is
our
way
to
meddle
in
things
that
do
concern
us
landlord
he
saw
his
tenant
once
or
twice
when
he
was
hoeing
his
turnips
and
passed
the
time
of
day
and
landlord
wife
wore
her
new
brooch
to
church
every
sunday
but
we
did
mix
much
with
the
ghosts
at
any
time
all
except
an
idiot
lad
there
was
in
the
village
and
he
did
know
the
difference
between
a
man
and
a
ghost
poor
innocent
on
jubilee
day
however
somebody
told
captain
roberts
why
the
church
bells
were
ringing
and
he
hoisted
a
flag
and
fired
off
his
guns
like
a
loyal
englishman
is
true
the
guns
were
shotted
and
one
of
the
round
shot
knocked
a
hole
in
farmer
johnstone
barn
but
nobody
thought
much
of
that
in
such
a
season
of
rejoicing
it
was
till
our
celebrations
were
over
that
we
noticed
that
anything
was
wrong
in
fairfield
was
shoemaker
who
told
me
first
about
it
one
morning
at
the
fox
and
grapes
you
know
my
great
he
said
to
me
you
mean
joshua
the
quiet
lad
i
answered
knowing
him
well
quiet
said
shoemaker
indignantly
quiet
you
call
him
coming
home
at
three
every
morning
as
drunk
as
a
magistrate
and
waking
up
the
whole
house
with
his
noise
why
it
ca
be
joshua
i
said
for
i
knew
him
for
one
of
the
most
respectable
young
ghosts
in
the
village
joshua
it
is
said
shoemaker
and
one
of
these
nights
he
find
himself
out
in
the
street
if
he
is
careful
this
kind
of
talk
shocked
me
i
can
tell
you
for
i
do
like
to
hear
a
man
abusing
his
own
family
and
i
could
hardly
believe
that
a
steady
youngster
like
joshua
had
taken
to
drink
but
just
then
in
came
butcher
aylwin
in
such
a
temper
that
he
could
hardly
drink
his
beer
the
young
puppy
the
young
puppy
he
kept
on
saying
and
it
was
some
time
before
shoemaker
and
i
found
out
that
he
was
talking
about
his
ancestor
that
fell
at
senlac
drink
said
shoemaker
hopefully
for
we
all
like
company
in
our
misfortunes
and
butcher
nodded
grimly
the
young
noodle
he
said
emptying
his
tankard
well
after
that
i
kept
my
ears
open
and
it
was
the
same
story
all
over
the
village
there
was
hardly
a
young
man
among
all
the
ghosts
of
fairfield
who
did
roll
home
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
worse
for
liquor
i
used
to
wake
up
in
the
night
and
hear
them
stumble
past
my
house
singing
outrageous
songs
the
worst
of
it
was
that
we
could
keep
the
scandal
to
ourselves
and
the
folk
at
greenhill
began
to
talk
of
sodden
fairfield
and
taught
their
children
to
sing
a
song
about
us
sodden
fairfield
sodden
fairfield
has
no
use
for
rum
for
breakfast
rum
for
dinner
rum
for
tea
and
rum
for
supper
we
are
in
our
village
but
we
did
like
that
of
course
we
soon
found
out
where
the
young
fellows
went
to
get
the
drink
and
landlord
was
terribly
cut
up
that
his
tenant
should
have
turned
out
so
badly
but
his
wife
would
hear
of
parting
with
the
brooch
so
that
he
could
give
the
captain
notice
to
quit
but
as
time
went
on
things
grew
from
bad
to
worse
and
at
all
hours
of
the
day
you
would
see
those
young
reprobates
sleeping
it
off
on
the
village
green
nearly
every
afternoon
a
used
to
jolt
down
to
the
ship
with
a
lading
of
rum
and
though
the
older
ghosts
seemed
inclined
to
give
the
captain
hospitality
the
the
youngsters
were
neither
to
hold
nor
to
bind
so
one
afternoon
when
i
was
taking
my
nap
i
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
and
there
was
parson
looking
very
serious
like
a
man
with
a
job
before
him
that
he
did
altogether
relish
i
going
down
to
talk
to
the
captain
about
all
this
drunkenness
in
the
village
and
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
he
said
straight
out
i
ca
say
that
i
fancied
the
visit
much
myself
and
i
tried
to
hint
to
parson
that
as
after
all
they
were
only
a
lot
of
ghosts
it
did
very
much
matter
dead
or
alive
i
responsible
for
the
good
conduct
he
said
and
i
going
to
do
my
duty
and
put
a
stop
to
this
continued
disorder
and
you
are
coming
with
me
john
simmons
so
i
went
parson
being
a
persuasive
kind
of
man
we
went
down
to
the
ship
and
as
we
approached
her
i
could
see
the
captain
tasting
the
air
on
deck
when
he
saw
parson
he
took
off
his
hat
very
politely
and
i
can
tell
you
that
i
was
relieved
to
find
that
he
had
a
proper
respect
for
the
cloth
parson
acknowledged
his
salute
and
spoke
out
stoutly
enough
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
have
a
word
with
you
come
on
board
sir
come
on
board
said
the
captain
and
i
could
tell
by
his
voice
that
he
knew
why
we
were
there
parson
and
i
climbed
up
an
uneasy
kind
of
ladder
and
the
captain
took
us
into
the
great
cabin
at
the
back
of
the
ship
where
the
was
it
was
the
most
wonderful
place
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
all
full
of
gold
and
silver
plate
swords
with
jewelled
scabbards
carved
oak
chairs
and
great
chests
that
look
as
though
they
were
bursting
with
guineas
even
parson
was
surprised
and
he
did
not
shake
his
head
very
hard
when
the
captain
took
down
some
silver
cups
and
poured
us
out
a
drink
of
rum
i
tasted
mine
and
i
do
mind
saying
that
it
changed
my
view
of
things
entirely
there
was
nothing
betwixt
and
between
about
that
rum
and
i
felt
that
it
was
ridiculous
to
blame
the
lads
for
drinking
too
much
of
stuff
like
that
it
seemed
to
fill
my
veins
with
honey
and
fire
parson
put
the
case
squarely
to
the
captain
but
i
did
listen
much
to
what
he
said
i
was
busy
sipping
my
drink
and
looking
through
the
window
at
the
fishes
swimming
to
and
fro
over
landlord
turnips
just
then
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
they
should
be
there
though
afterwards
of
course
i
could
see
that
that
proved
it
was
a
but
even
then
i
thought
it
was
queer
when
i
saw
a
drowned
sailor
float
by
in
the
thin
air
with
his
hair
and
beard
all
full
of
bubbles
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
anything
quite
like
that
at
fairfield
all
the
time
i
was
regarding
the
wonders
of
the
deep
parson
was
telling
captain
roberts
how
there
was
no
peace
or
rest
in
the
village
owing
to
the
curse
of
drunkenness
and
what
a
bad
example
the
youngsters
were
setting
to
the
older
ghosts
the
captain
listened
very
attentively
and
only
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
about
boys
being
boys
and
young
men
sowing
their
wild
oats
but
when
parson
had
finished
his
speech
he
filled
up
our
silver
cups
and
said
to
parson
with
a
flourish
i
should
be
sorry
to
cause
trouble
anywhere
where
i
have
been
made
welcome
and
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
put
to
sea
tomorrow
night
and
now
you
must
drink
me
a
prosperous
voyage
so
we
all
stood
up
and
drank
the
toast
with
honour
and
that
noble
rum
was
like
hot
oil
in
my
veins
after
that
captain
showed
us
some
of
the
curiosities
he
had
brought
back
from
foreign
parts
and
we
were
greatly
amazed
though
afterwards
i
could
clearly
remember
what
they
were
and
then
i
found
myself
walking
across
the
turnips
with
parson
and
i
was
telling
him
of
the
glories
of
the
deep
that
i
had
seen
through
the
window
of
the
ship
he
turned
on
me
severely
if
i
were
you
john
simmons
he
said
i
should
go
straight
home
to
bed
he
has
a
way
of
putting
things
that
would
occur
to
an
ordinary
man
has
parson
and
i
did
as
he
told
me
well
next
day
it
came
on
to
blow
and
it
blew
harder
and
harder
till
about
eight
at
night
i
heard
a
noise
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
i
dare
say
you
wo
believe
me
it
seems
a
bit
tall
even
to
me
but
the
wind
had
lifted
the
thatch
of
my
pigsty
into
the
widow
garden
a
second
time
i
thought
i
would
wait
to
hear
what
widow
had
to
say
about
it
so
i
went
across
the
green
to
the
fox
and
grapes
and
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
i
danced
along
on
tiptoe
like
a
girl
at
the
fair
when
i
got
to
the
inn
landlord
had
to
help
me
shut
the
door
it
seemed
as
though
a
dozen
goats
were
pushing
against
it
to
come
in
out
of
the
storm
it
a
powerful
tempest
he
said
drawing
the
beer
i
hear
a
chimney
down
at
dickory
end
it
a
funny
thing
how
these
sailors
know
about
the
weather
i
answered
when
captain
said
he
was
going
tonight
i
was
thinking
it
would
take
a
capful
of
wind
to
carry
the
ship
back
to
sea
but
now
here
more
than
a
capful
ah
yes
said
landlord
it
tonight
he
goes
true
enough
and
mind
you
though
he
treated
me
handsome
over
the
rent
i
not
sure
it
a
loss
to
the
village
i
do
hold
with
gentrice
who
fetch
their
drink
from
london
instead
of
helping
local
traders
to
get
their
living
but
you
have
got
any
rum
like
his
i
said
to
draw
him
out
his
neck
grew
red
above
his
collar
and
i
was
afraid
i
gone
too
far
but
after
a
while
he
got
his
breath
with
a
grunt
john
simmons
he
said
if
you
come
down
here
this
windy
night
to
talk
a
lot
of
fool
talk
you
wasted
a
journey
well
of
course
then
i
had
to
smooth
him
down
with
praising
his
rum
and
heaven
forgive
me
for
swearing
it
was
better
than
captain
for
the
like
of
that
rum
no
living
lips
have
tasted
save
mine
and
parson
but
somehow
or
other
i
brought
landlord
round
and
presently
we
must
have
a
glass
of
his
best
to
prove
its
quality
beat
that
if
you
can
he
cried
and
we
both
raised
our
glasses
to
our
mouths
only
to
stop
and
look
at
each
other
in
amaze
for
the
wind
that
had
been
howling
outside
like
an
outrageous
dog
had
all
of
a
sudden
turned
as
melodious
as
the
of
a
christmas
eve
surely
that
not
my
martha
whispered
landlord
martha
being
his
that
lived
in
the
loft
overhead
we
went
to
the
door
and
the
wind
burst
it
open
so
that
the
handle
was
driven
clean
into
the
plaster
of
the
wall
but
we
did
think
about
that
at
the
time
for
over
our
heads
sailing
very
comfortably
through
the
windy
stars
was
the
ship
that
had
passed
the
summer
in
landlord
field
her
portholes
and
her
were
blazing
with
lights
and
there
was
a
noise
of
singing
and
fiddling
on
her
decks
he
gone
shouted
landlord
above
the
storm
and
he
taken
half
the
village
with
him
i
could
only
nod
in
answer
not
having
lungs
like
bellows
of
leather
in
the
morning
we
were
able
to
measure
the
strength
of
the
storm
and
over
and
above
my
pigsty
there
was
damage
enough
wrought
in
the
village
to
keep
us
busy
true
it
is
that
the
children
had
to
break
down
no
branches
for
the
firing
that
autumn
since
the
wind
had
strewn
the
woods
with
more
than
they
could
carry
away
many
of
our
ghosts
were
scattered
abroad
but
this
time
very
few
came
back
all
the
young
men
having
sailed
with
captain
and
not
only
ghosts
for
a
poor
lad
was
missing
and
we
reckoned
that
he
had
stowed
himself
away
or
perhaps
shipped
as
not
knowing
any
better
what
with
the
lamentations
of
the
and
the
grumbling
of
families
who
had
lost
an
ancestor
the
village
was
upset
for
a
while
and
the
funny
thing
was
that
it
was
the
folk
who
had
complained
most
of
the
of
the
youngsters
who
made
most
noise
now
that
they
were
gone
i
had
any
sympathy
with
shoemaker
or
butcher
who
ran
about
saying
how
much
they
missed
their
lads
but
it
made
me
grieve
to
hear
the
poor
bereaved
girls
calling
their
lovers
by
name
on
the
village
green
at
nightfall
it
did
seem
fair
to
me
that
they
should
have
lost
their
men
a
second
time
after
giving
up
life
in
order
to
join
them
as
like
as
not
still
not
even
a
spirit
can
be
sorry
for
ever
and
after
a
few
months
we
made
up
our
mind
that
the
folk
who
had
sailed
in
the
ship
were
never
coming
back
and
we
did
talk
about
it
any
more
and
then
one
day
i
dare
say
it
would
be
a
couple
of
years
after
when
the
whole
business
was
quite
forgotten
who
should
come
trapesing
along
the
road
from
portsmouth
but
the
daft
lad
who
had
gone
away
with
the
ship
without
waiting
till
he
was
dead
to
become
a
ghost
you
never
saw
such
a
boy
as
that
in
all
your
life
he
had
a
great
rusty
cutlass
hanging
to
a
string
at
his
waist
and
he
was
tattooed
all
over
in
fine
colours
so
that
even
his
face
looked
like
a
girl
sampler
he
had
a
handkerchief
in
his
hand
full
of
foreign
shells
and
pieces
of
small
money
very
curious
and
he
walked
up
to
the
well
outside
his
mother
house
and
drew
himself
a
drink
as
if
he
had
been
nowhere
in
particular
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
had
come
back
as
as
he
went
and
try
as
we
might
we
could
get
anything
reasonable
out
of
him
he
talked
a
lot
of
gibberish
about
and
walking
the
plank
and
crimson
murders
things
which
a
decent
sailor
should
know
nothing
about
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
all
his
manners
captain
had
been
more
of
a
pirate
than
a
gentleman
mariner
but
to
draw
sense
out
of
that
boy
was
as
hard
as
picking
cherries
off
a
one
silly
tale
he
had
that
he
kept
on
drifting
back
to
and
to
hear
him
you
would
have
thought
that
it
was
the
only
thing
that
happened
to
him
in
his
life
we
was
at
anchor
he
would
say
off
an
island
called
the
basket
of
flowers
and
the
sailors
had
caught
a
lot
of
parrots
and
we
were
teaching
them
to
swear
up
and
down
the
decks
up
and
down
the
decks
and
the
language
they
used
was
dreadful
then
we
looked
up
and
saw
the
masts
of
the
spanish
ship
outside
the
harbour
outside
the
harbour
they
were
so
we
threw
the
parrots
into
the
sea
and
sailed
out
to
fight
and
all
the
parrots
were
drownded
in
the
sea
and
the
language
they
used
was
dreadful
that
the
sort
of
boy
he
was
nothing
but
silly
talk
of
parrots
when
we
asked
him
about
the
fighting
and
we
never
had
a
chance
of
teaching
him
better
for
two
days
after
he
ran
away
again
and
has
been
seen
since
that
my
story
and
i
assure
you
that
things
like
that
are
happening
at
fairfield
all
the
time
the
ship
has
never
come
back
but
somehow
as
people
grow
older
they
seem
to
think
that
one
of
these
windy
nights
she
come
sailing
in
over
the
hedges
with
all
the
lost
ghosts
on
board
well
when
she
comes
she
be
welcome
there
one
that
has
never
grown
tired
of
waiting
for
her
lad
to
return
every
night
you
see
her
out
on
the
green
straining
her
poor
eyes
with
looking
for
the
among
the
stars
a
faithful
lass
you
call
her
and
i
thinking
you
be
right
landlord
field
was
a
penny
the
worse
for
the
visit
but
they
do
say
that
since
then
the
turnips
that
have
been
grown
in
it
have
tasted
of
rum
a
drama
of
youth
i
for
some
days
school
had
seemed
to
me
even
more
tedious
than
usual
the
long
train
journey
in
the
morning
the
walk
through
farringdon
meat
market
which
æsthetic
butchers
made
hideous
with
mosaics
of
the
intestines
of
animals
as
if
the
horror
of
suety
pavements
and
bloody
sawdust
did
not
suffice
the
weariness
of
inventing
lies
that
no
one
believed
to
account
for
my
lateness
and
neglected
homework
and
the
monotonous
lessons
that
held
me
from
my
dreams
without
ever
for
a
single
instant
capturing
my
interest
all
these
things
made
me
ill
with
repulsion
worst
of
all
was
the
society
of
my
cheerful
contented
comrades
to
avoid
which
i
was
compelled
to
mope
in
deserted
corridors
the
prey
of
a
sorrow
that
could
not
be
enjoyed
a
hatred
that
was
in
no
way
stimulating
at
the
best
of
times
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
disgusted
me
desks
windows
and
floors
and
even
the
grass
in
the
quadrangle
were
greasy
with
london
soot
and
there
was
nowhere
any
clean
air
to
breathe
or
smell
i
hated
the
gritty
asphalt
that
gave
no
peace
to
my
feet
and
cut
my
knees
when
my
clumsiness
made
me
fall
i
hated
the
long
stone
corridors
whose
echoes
seemed
to
me
to
mock
my
hesitating
footsteps
when
i
passed
from
one
dull
class
to
another
i
hated
the
stuffy
malodorous
classrooms
with
their
whistling
and
noise
of
inharmonious
life
i
would
have
hated
the
yellow
fogs
had
they
not
sometimes
shortened
the
hours
of
my
bondage
that
five
hundred
boys
shared
this
horrible
environment
with
me
did
not
abate
my
sufferings
a
jot
for
it
was
clear
that
they
did
not
find
it
distasteful
and
they
therefore
became
as
unsympathetic
for
me
as
the
smell
and
noise
and
rotting
stones
of
the
school
itself
the
masters
moved
as
it
were
in
another
world
and
as
the
classes
were
large
they
understood
me
as
little
as
i
understood
them
they
knew
that
i
was
idle
and
untruthful
and
they
could
not
know
that
i
was
as
full
of
nerves
as
a
girl
and
that
the
mere
task
of
getting
to
school
every
morning
made
me
physically
sick
they
punished
me
repeatedly
and
in
vain
for
i
found
every
hour
i
passed
within
the
walls
of
the
school
an
overwhelming
punishment
in
itself
and
nothing
i
made
any
difference
to
me
i
lied
to
them
because
they
expected
it
and
because
i
had
no
words
in
which
to
express
the
truth
if
i
knew
it
which
is
doubtful
for
some
reason
i
could
not
tell
them
at
home
why
i
got
on
so
badly
at
school
or
no
doubt
they
would
have
taken
me
away
and
sent
me
to
a
country
school
as
they
did
afterwards
nearly
all
the
real
sorrows
of
childhood
are
due
to
this
dumbness
of
the
emotions
we
teach
children
to
convey
facts
by
means
of
words
but
we
do
not
teach
them
how
to
make
their
feelings
intelligible
unfortunately
perhaps
i
was
very
happy
at
night
with
my
and
my
dreams
so
that
the
real
misery
of
my
days
escaped
the
attention
of
the
people
of
course
i
never
even
thought
of
doing
my
homework
and
the
labour
of
inventing
new
lies
every
day
to
account
for
my
negligence
became
so
wearisome
that
once
or
twice
i
told
the
truth
and
simply
said
i
had
not
done
it
but
the
masters
held
that
this
frankness
aggravated
the
offence
and
i
had
to
take
up
anew
my
tiresome
tale
of
improbable
calamities
sometimes
my
stories
were
so
wild
that
the
whole
class
would
laugh
and
i
would
have
to
laugh
myself
yet
on
the
strength
of
this
elaborate
politeness
to
authority
i
came
to
believe
myself
that
i
was
untruthful
by
nature
the
boys
disliked
me
because
i
was
not
sociable
but
after
a
time
they
grew
tired
of
bullying
me
and
left
me
alone
i
detested
them
because
they
were
all
so
much
alike
that
their
numbers
filled
me
with
horror
i
remember
that
the
first
day
i
went
to
school
i
walked
round
and
round
the
quadrangle
in
the
and
every
boy
who
passed
stopped
me
and
asked
me
my
name
and
what
my
father
was
when
i
said
he
was
an
engineer
every
one
of
the
boys
replied
oh
the
man
who
drives
the
engine
the
reiteration
of
this
childish
joke
made
me
hate
them
from
the
first
and
afterwards
i
discovered
that
they
were
equally
unimaginative
in
everything
they
did
sometimes
i
would
stand
in
the
midst
of
them
and
wonder
what
was
the
matter
with
me
that
i
should
be
so
different
from
all
the
rest
when
they
teased
me
repeating
the
same
questions
over
and
over
again
i
cried
easily
like
a
girl
without
quite
knowing
why
for
their
stupidities
could
not
hurt
my
reason
but
when
they
bullied
me
i
did
not
cry
because
the
pain
made
me
forget
the
sadness
of
my
heart
perhaps
it
was
because
of
this
that
they
thought
i
was
a
little
mad
grey
day
followed
grey
day
and
i
might
in
time
have
abandoned
all
efforts
to
be
faithful
to
my
dreams
and
achieved
a
kind
of
submission
that
was
all
the
authorities
expected
of
notorious
dunces
i
might
have
taught
my
senses
to
accept
the
evil
conditions
of
life
in
that
unclean
place
i
might
even
have
succeeded
in
making
myself
one
with
the
army
of
shadows
that
thronged
in
the
quadrangle
and
filled
the
air
with
meaningless
noise
but
one
evening
when
i
reached
home
i
saw
by
the
faces
of
the
people
that
something
had
upset
their
elaborate
precautions
for
an
ordered
life
and
i
discovered
that
my
brother
who
had
stayed
at
home
with
a
cold
was
ill
in
bed
with
the
measles
for
a
while
the
significance
of
the
news
escaped
me
then
with
a
sudden
movement
of
my
heart
which
made
me
feel
ill
i
realised
that
probably
i
would
have
to
stay
away
from
school
because
of
the
infection
my
feet
tapped
on
the
floor
with
joy
though
i
tried
to
appear
unconcerned
then
as
i
nursed
my
sudden
hope
of
freedom
a
little
fearfully
lest
it
should
prove
an
illusion
a
new
and
enchanting
idea
came
to
me
i
slipped
from
the
room
ran
upstairs
to
my
bedroom
and
standing
by
the
side
of
my
bed
tore
open
my
waistcoat
and
shirt
with
clumsy
trembling
fingers
one
two
three
four
five
i
counted
the
spots
in
a
triumphant
voice
and
then
with
a
sudden
revulsion
sat
down
on
the
bed
to
give
the
world
an
opportunity
to
settle
back
in
its
place
i
had
the
measles
and
therefore
i
should
not
have
to
go
back
to
school
i
shut
my
eyes
for
a
minute
and
opened
them
again
but
still
i
had
the
measles
the
cup
of
happiness
was
at
my
lips
but
i
sipped
delicately
because
it
was
full
to
the
brim
and
i
would
not
spill
a
drop
this
mood
did
not
last
long
i
had
to
run
down
the
house
and
tell
the
world
the
good
news
the
people
rebuked
my
joyousness
while
admitting
that
it
might
be
as
well
that
i
should
have
the
measles
then
as
later
on
in
spite
of
their
air
of
resignation
i
could
hardly
sit
still
for
excitement
i
wanted
to
go
into
the
kitchen
and
show
my
measles
to
the
servants
but
i
was
told
to
stay
where
i
was
in
front
of
the
fire
while
my
bed
was
moved
into
my
brother
room
so
i
stared
at
the
glowing
coals
till
my
eyes
smarted
and
dreamed
long
dreams
i
would
be
in
bed
for
days
all
warm
from
head
to
foot
and
no
one
would
interrupt
my
pleasant
excursions
in
the
world
i
preferred
to
this
if
i
had
heard
of
the
beneficent
microbe
to
which
lowed
my
happiness
i
would
have
mentioned
it
in
my
prayers
late
that
night
i
called
over
to
my
brother
to
ask
how
long
measles
lasted
he
told
me
to
go
to
sleep
so
that
i
knew
he
did
not
know
the
answer
to
my
question
i
lay
at
ease
tranquilly
turning
the
problem
over
in
my
mind
four
weeks
six
weeks
eight
weeks
why
if
i
was
lucky
it
would
carry
me
through
to
the
holidays
at
all
events
school
was
already
very
far
away
like
a
nightmare
remembered
at
noon
i
said
to
my
brother
and
received
an
irritated
grunt
in
reply
i
did
not
mind
his
surliness
tomorrow
when
i
woke
up
i
would
begin
my
dreams
ii
when
i
found
myself
in
bed
in
the
morning
already
sick
at
heart
because
even
while
i
slept
i
could
not
forget
the
long
torment
of
my
life
at
school
i
would
lie
still
for
a
minute
or
two
and
try
to
concentrate
my
shuddering
mind
on
something
pleasant
some
little
detail
of
the
moment
that
seemed
to
justify
hope
perhaps
i
had
some
money
to
spend
or
a
holiday
to
look
forward
to
though
often
enough
i
would
find
nothing
to
save
me
from
realising
with
childish
intensity
the
greyness
of
the
world
in
which
it
was
my
fate
to
move
i
did
not
want
to
go
out
into
life
it
was
dull
and
gruel
and
greasy
with
soot
i
only
wanted
to
stop
at
home
in
any
little
quiet
corner
out
of
everybody
way
and
think
my
long
heroic
thoughts
but
even
while
i
mumbled
my
hasty
breakfast
and
ran
to
the
station
to
catch
my
train
the
atmosphere
of
the
school
was
all
about
me
and
my
courage
trembled
and
vanished
when
i
woke
from
sleep
the
morning
after
my
good
fortune
i
did
not
at
first
realise
the
extent
of
my
happiness
i
only
knew
that
deep
in
my
heart
i
was
conscious
of
some
great
cause
for
joy
then
my
eyes
still
dim
with
sleep
discovered
that
i
was
in
my
brother
bedroom
and
in
a
flash
the
joyful
truth
was
revealed
to
me
i
sat
up
and
hastily
examined
my
body
to
make
sure
that
the
rash
had
not
disappeared
and
then
my
spirit
sang
a
song
of
thanksgiving
of
which
the
refrain
was
i
have
the
measles
i
lay
back
in
bed
and
enjoyed
the
exquisite
luxury
of
thinking
of
the
evils
that
i
had
escaped
for
once
my
morbid
sense
of
atmosphere
was
a
desirable
possession
and
helpful
to
my
happiness
it
was
delightful
to
pull
the
bedclothes
over
my
shoulders
and
conceive
the
feelings
of
a
small
boy
who
should
ride
to
town
in
a
jolting
train
walk
through
a
hundred
kinds
of
dirt
and
a
hundred
disgusting
smells
to
win
to
prison
at
last
where
he
should
perform
meaningless
tasks
in
the
distressing
society
of
five
hundred
mocking
apes
it
was
pleasant
to
see
the
morning
sun
and
feel
no
sickness
in
my
stomach
no
sense
of
depression
in
my
tired
brain
across
the
room
my
brother
gurgled
and
choked
in
his
sleep
and
in
some
subtle
way
contributed
to
my
ecstasy
of
tranquillity
i
was
no
longer
concerned
for
the
duration
of
my
happiness
i
felt
that
this
peace
that
i
had
desired
so
long
must
surely
last
for
ever
to
the
folk
who
came
to
see
us
during
the
day
the
doctor
certain
unmarried
aunts
truculently
maternal
and
the
family
itself
my
brother
case
was
far
more
interesting
than
mine
because
he
had
caught
the
measles
really
badly
i
just
had
them
comfortably
enough
to
be
infectious
but
not
enough
to
feel
ill
so
i
was
left
in
pleasant
solitude
while
the
women
competed
for
the
honour
of
smoothing
my
brother
pillow
and
tiptoeing
in
a
fidgeting
manner
round
his
bed
i
lay
on
my
back
and
looked
with
placid
interest
at
the
cracks
in
the
ceiling
they
were
like
the
main
roads
in
a
map
and
i
amused
myself
by
building
little
houses
beside
them
houses
full
of
books
and
warm
hearthrugs
and
with
a
nice
pond
lively
with
tadpoles
in
the
garden
of
each
from
the
windows
of
the
houses
you
could
watch
all
the
traffic
that
went
along
the
road
men
and
women
and
horses
and
best
of
all
the
boys
going
to
school
in
the
morning
boys
who
had
not
done
their
homework
and
who
would
be
late
for
prayers
when
i
talked
about
the
cracks
to
my
brother
he
said
that
perhaps
the
ceiling
would
give
way
and
fall
on
our
heads
i
thought
about
this
too
and
found
it
quite
easy
to
picture
myself
lying
in
the
bed
with
a
smashed
head
and
blood
all
over
the
pillow
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
plaster
might
smash
me
all
over
and
my
impressions
of
farringdon
meat
market
added
a
gruesome
vividness
to
my
conception
of
the
consequences
i
always
found
it
pleasant
to
imagine
horrible
things
it
was
only
the
reality
that
made
me
sick
towards
nightfall
i
became
a
little
feverish
and
i
heard
the
say
that
they
would
give
me
some
medicine
later
on
medicine
for
me
signified
the
nauseous
powders
of
gregory
so
i
pretended
to
be
asleep
every
time
anyone
came
into
the
room
in
order
to
escape
my
destiny
until
at
last
some
one
stood
by
my
bedside
so
long
that
i
became
cramped
and
had
to
pretend
to
wake
up
then
i
was
given
the
medicine
and
found
to
my
surprise
that
it
was
delicious
and
tasted
of
oranges
i
felt
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
somewhere
but
my
head
sat
a
little
heavily
on
my
shoulders
and
i
would
not
trouble
to
fix
the
responsibility
this
time
i
fell
asleep
in
earnest
and
woke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
find
my
brother
standing
by
my
bed
making
noises
with
his
mouth
i
thought
that
he
had
gone
mad
and
would
kill
me
perhaps
but
after
a
time
he
went
back
to
bed
saying
all
the
bad
words
he
knew
the
excitement
had
made
me
wide
awake
and
i
tossed
about
thinking
of
the
cracked
ceiling
above
my
head
the
room
was
quite
dark
and
i
could
see
nothing
so
that
it
might
be
bulging
over
me
without
my
knowing
it
i
stood
up
in
bed
and
stretched
up
my
arm
but
i
could
not
reach
the
ceiling
yet
when
i
lay
down
again
i
felt
as
though
it
had
sunk
so
far
that
it
was
touching
my
hair
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
breathe
in
such
a
small
space
i
was
afraid
to
move
for
fear
of
bringing
it
down
upon
me
and
in
a
short
while
the
pressure
upon
my
body
became
unbearable
and
i
shrieked
out
for
help
some
one
came
in
and
lit
the
gas
and
found
me
looking
very
foolish
and
my
brother
delirious
i
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
but
was
conscious
through
my
dreams
that
the
gas
was
still
alight
and
that
they
were
watching
by
my
bedside
in
the
morning
he
was
very
ill
and
i
was
no
longer
feverish
so
it
was
decided
to
move
me
back
into
my
own
bedroom
i
was
wrapped
up
in
the
bedclothes
and
told
to
sit
still
while
the
bed
was
moved
i
sat
in
an
armchair
feeling
like
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
and
looking
at
the
cracks
in
the
ceiling
which
seemed
to
me
like
roads
i
knew
that
i
had
already
lost
all
importance
as
an
invalid
but
i
was
very
happy
nevertheless
for
from
the
window
of
one
of
my
little
houses
i
was
watching
the
boys
going
to
school
and
my
heart
was
warm
with
the
knowledge
of
my
own
emancipation
as
my
legs
hung
down
from
the
chair
i
found
it
hard
to
keep
my
slippers
on
my
stockingless
feet
iii
there
followed
for
me
a
period
of
deep
and
unbroken
satisfaction
i
was
soon
considered
well
enough
to
get
up
and
i
lived
pleasantly
between
the
sofa
and
the
fireside
waiting
on
my
brother
convalescence
for
it
had
been
settled
that
i
should
go
away
with
him
to
the
country
for
a
change
of
air
i
read
dickens
and
dumas
in
english
and
made
up
long
stories
in
which
i
myself
played
important
but
not
always
heroic
parts
by
means
of
intellectual
exercises
of
this
kind
i
achieved
a
tranquillity
like
that
of
an
old
man
fearing
nothing
desiring
nothing
regretting
nothing
i
no
longer
reckoned
the
days
or
the
hours
i
content
to
enjoy
a
passionless
condition
of
being
that
asked
no
questions
and
sought
none
of
me
nor
did
i
trouble
to
number
my
journeys
in
the
world
of
infinite
shadows
but
in
that
long
hour
of
peace
i
realised
that
in
some
inexplicable
way
i
was
interested
in
the
body
of
a
little
boy
whose
hands
obeyed
my
unspoken
wishes
whose
legs
sprawled
before
me
on
the
sofa
i
knew
that
before
i
met
him
this
boy
whose
littleness
surprised
me
had
suffered
ill
dreams
in
a
nameless
world
and
now
worn
out
with
tears
and
humiliation
and
dread
of
life
he
slept
and
while
he
slept
i
watched
him
dispassionately
as
i
would
have
looked
at
a
crippled
to
have
felt
compassion
for
him
would
have
disturbed
the
tranquillity
that
was
a
necessary
condition
of
my
existence
so
i
contented
myself
with
noticing
his
presence
and
giving
him
a
small
part
in
the
pageant
of
my
dreams
he
was
not
so
beautiful
as
i
wished
all
my
comrades
to
be
and
he
was
besides
very
small
but
shadows
are
amiable
and
they
did
not
blame
him
because
he
cried
when
he
was
teased
and
did
not
cry
when
he
was
beaten
or
because
the
wild
unreason
of
his
sorrow
made
him
find
cause
for
tears
in
the
very
fullness
of
his
rare
enjoyment
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
it
seems
to
me
i
saw
this
little
boy
as
he
was
and
with
a
face
swept
clean
of
all
emotions
save
where
his
two
great
eyes
glowed
with
a
sulky
fire
under
exaggerated
eyebrows
i
noticed
his
grimy
nails
his
soiled
collar
his
unbrushed
clothes
the
patent
signs
of
defeat
changing
to
utter
rout
and
from
the
heights
of
my
great
peace
i
was
not
sorry
for
him
he
was
like
that
other
boys
were
different
that
was
all
and
then
on
a
day
fear
returned
to
my
heart
and
my
newly
discovered
utopia
was
no
more
i
do
not
know
what
chance
word
of
the
people
or
what
random
thought
of
mine
did
the
mischief
but
of
a
sudden
i
realised
that
for
all
my
dreaming
i
was
only
separated
by
a
measurable
number
of
days
from
the
horror
of
school
already
i
was
sick
with
fear
and
in
place
of
my
dreams
i
distressed
myself
by
visualising
the
scenes
of
the
life
i
dreaded
the
meat
market
the
dusty
shadows
of
the
gymnasium
the
sombre
reticence
of
the
great
hall
all
that
my
lost
tranquillity
had
given
me
was
a
keener
sense
of
my
own
being
my
smallness
my
ugliness
my
helplessness
in
the
face
of
the
great
cruel
world
before
i
had
sometimes
been
able
to
dull
my
emotions
in
unpleasant
circumstances
and
thus
achieve
a
dogged
calm
now
i
was
horribly
conscious
of
my
physical
sensations
and
above
all
of
that
deadly
sinking
in
my
stomach
called
fear
i
clenched
my
hands
telling
myself
that
i
was
happy
and
trying
to
force
my
mind
to
pleasant
thoughts
but
though
my
head
swam
with
the
effort
i
continued
to
be
conscious
that
i
was
afraid
in
the
midst
of
my
mental
struggles
i
discovered
that
even
if
i
succeeded
in
thinking
happy
things
i
should
still
have
to
go
back
to
school
after
all
and
the
knowledge
that
thought
could
not
avert
calamity
was
like
a
bruise
on
my
mind
i
pinched
my
arms
and
legs
with
the
idea
that
immediate
pain
would
make
me
forget
my
fears
for
the
future
but
i
was
not
brave
enough
to
pinch
them
really
hard
and
i
could
not
forget
the
motive
for
my
action
i
lay
back
on
the
sofa
and
kicked
the
cushions
with
my
feet
in
a
kind
of
forlorn
anger
thought
was
no
use
nothing
was
any
use
and
my
stomach
was
sick
sick
with
fear
and
suddenly
i
became
aware
of
an
immense
fatigue
that
overwhelmed
my
mind
and
my
body
and
made
me
feel
as
helpless
as
a
little
child
the
tears
that
were
always
near
my
eyes
streamed
down
my
face
making
my
cheek
sore
against
the
wet
cushion
and
my
breath
came
in
painful
ridiculous
gulps
for
a
moment
i
made
an
effort
to
control
my
grief
and
then
i
gave
way
utterly
crying
with
my
whole
body
like
a
little
child
until
like
a
little
child
i
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
the
room
was
grey
with
dusk
and
i
sat
up
with
a
swaying
head
glad
to
hide
the
shame
of
my
foolish
swollen
face
amongst
the
shadows
my
mouth
was
still
salt
with
tears
and
i
was
very
thirsty
but
i
was
always
anxious
to
hide
my
weakness
from
other
people
and
i
was
afraid
that
if
i
asked
for
something
to
drink
they
would
see
that
i
had
been
crying
the
fire
had
gone
out
while
i
slept
and
i
felt
cold
and
stiff
but
my
abandonment
of
restraint
had
relieved
me
and
my
fear
was
now
no
more
than
a
vague
unrest
my
mind
thought
slowly
but
very
clearly
i
saw
that
it
was
a
pity
that
i
had
not
been
more
ill
than
i
was
for
then
like
my
brother
i
should
have
gone
away
for
a
month
instead
of
a
fortnight
as
it
was
everybody
laughed
at
me
because
i
looked
so
well
and
said
they
did
not
believe
that
i
had
been
ill
at
all
if
i
had
thought
of
it
earlier
i
might
have
been
able
to
make
myself
worse
somehow
or
other
but
now
it
was
too
late
when
the
maid
came
in
and
lit
the
gas
for
tea
she
blamed
me
for
letting
the
fire
out
and
told
me
that
i
had
a
dirty
face
i
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
slip
away
and
wash
my
burning
cheeks
in
cold
water
when
i
had
finished
and
dried
my
face
on
the
rough
towel
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
glass
i
looked
as
if
i
had
been
to
the
seaside
for
a
holiday
my
cheeks
were
so
red
that
night
as
i
lay
sleepless
in
my
bed
seeking
for
a
cool
place
between
the
sheets
in
which
to
rest
my
hot
feet
the
sickness
of
fear
returned
to
me
and
i
knew
that
i
was
lost
i
shut
my
eyes
tightly
but
i
could
not
shut
out
the
vivid
pictures
of
school
life
that
my
memory
had
stored
up
for
my
torment
i
beat
my
head
against
the
pillow
but
i
could
not
change
my
thoughts
i
recalled
all
the
possible
events
that
might
interfere
with
my
return
to
school
a
new
illness
a
railway
accident
even
suicide
but
my
reason
would
not
accept
these
romantic
issues
i
was
helpless
before
my
destiny
and
my
destiny
made
me
i
afraid
and
then
perhaps
i
was
half
asleep
or
fond
with
fear
i
leapt
out
of
bed
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
to
meet
life
and
fight
it
the
hem
of
my
nightshirt
tickled
my
shin
and
my
feet
grew
cold
on
the
carpet
but
though
i
stood
ready
with
my
fists
clenched
i
could
see
no
adversary
among
the
friendly
shadows
i
could
hear
no
sound
but
the
i
drumming
of
the
blood
against
the
walls
of
my
head
i
got
back
into
bed
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
about
my
chilled
body
it
seemed
that
life
would
not
fight
fair
and
being
only
a
little
boy
and
not
wise
like
the
people
i
could
find
no
way
in
which
to
outwit
it
iv
my
growing
panic
in
the
face
of
my
imminent
return
to
school
spoilt
my
holiday
and
i
watched
my
brother
careless
delight
in
the
surrey
with
keen
envy
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
easy
for
him
to
enjoy
himself
with
his
month
to
squander
and
in
any
case
he
was
a
healthy
cheerful
boy
who
liked
school
well
enough
when
he
was
there
though
of
course
he
liked
holidays
better
he
had
scant
patience
with
my
moods
and
secretly
i
too
thought
they
were
wicked
we
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
we
alone
were
responsible
for
our
sins
and
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
the
causes
of
my
wickedness
might
lie
beyond
my
control
the
beauty
of
the
scented
pines
and
the
new
green
of
the
bracken
took
my
breath
and
filled
my
heart
with
a
joy
that
changed
immediately
to
overwhelming
grief
for
i
could
not
help
contrasting
this
glorious
kind
of
life
with
the
squalid
existence
to
which
i
must
return
so
soon
i
realised
so
fiercely
the
force
of
the
contrast
that
i
was
afraid
to
make
friends
with
the
pines
and
admire
the
beauty
of
the
bracken
lest
i
should
increase
my
subsequent
anguish
and
i
hid
myself
in
dark
corners
of
the
woods
to
fight
the
growing
sickness
of
my
body
with
the
feeble
weapons
of
my
mind
there
followed
moments
of
bitter
sorrow
when
i
blamed
myself
for
not
taking
advantage
of
my
hours
of
freedom
and
i
hurried
along
the
sandy
lanes
in
a
desolate
effort
to
enjoy
myself
before
it
was
too
late
in
spite
of
the
miserable
manner
in
which
i
spent
my
days
the
fortnight
seemed
to
pass
with
extraordinary
rapidity
as
the
end
approached
the
people
around
me
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
conceal
my
emotions
the
deducing
from
my
melancholy
that
i
was
tired
of
holidays
and
would
be
glad
to
get
back
to
school
and
my
brother
burdening
me
with
idle
messages
to
the
other
that
shattered
my
hardly
formed
hope
that
school
did
not
really
exist
i
stood
ever
on
the
verge
of
tears
and
i
dreaded
when
i
had
to
leave
my
solitude
lest
some
turn
of
the
conversation
should
set
me
weeping
before
them
all
and
i
should
hear
once
more
what
i
knew
very
well
myself
that
it
was
a
shameful
thing
for
a
boy
of
my
age
to
cry
like
a
little
girl
yet
the
tears
were
there
and
the
hard
lump
in
my
throat
and
i
could
not
master
them
though
i
stood
in
the
woods
while
the
sun
set
with
a
splendour
that
chilled
my
heart
and
tried
to
drain
my
eyes
dry
of
their
rebellious
bitter
waters
i
would
choke
over
my
tea
and
be
rebuked
for
bad
manners
when
the
last
day
came
that
i
had
feared
most
of
all
i
succeeded
in
saying
goodbye
to
the
people
at
the
house
where
i
had
stopped
and
in
making
the
mournful
train
journey
home
without
disgracing
myself
it
seemed
as
though
a
merciful
stupor
had
dulled
my
senses
to
a
mute
acceptance
of
my
purgatory
i
slept
in
the
train
and
arrived
home
so
sleepy
that
i
was
allowed
to
go
straight
to
bed
without
comment
for
once
my
body
dominated
my
mind
and
i
slipped
between
the
sheets
in
an
ecstasy
of
fatigue
and
fell
asleep
immediately
something
of
this
rare
mood
lingered
with
me
in
the
morning
and
it
was
not
until
i
reached
the
meat
market
that
i
realised
the
extent
of
my
misfortune
i
saw
the
greasy
men
with
their
hands
and
aprons
stained
with
blood
i
saw
the
hideous
carcases
of
animals
the
masses
of
entrails
the
heaps
of
repulsive
hides
but
most
clearly
of
all
i
saw
an
ugly
sad
little
boy
with
a
satchel
of
books
on
his
back
set
down
in
the
midst
of
an
enormous
and
hostile
world
the
windows
and
stones
of
the
houses
were
black
with
soot
and
before
me
there
lay
school
the
place
that
had
never
brought
me
anything
but
sorrow
and
humiliation
i
went
on
but
as
i
slid
on
the
cobbles
my
mind
caught
an
echo
of
peace
the
peace
of
and
heather
the
peace
of
the
library
at
home
and
my
body
trembling
with
revulsion
i
leant
against
a
deadly
sick
then
i
turned
on
my
heels
and
walked
away
from
the
meat
market
and
the
school
for
ever
as
i
went
i
cried
sometimes
openly
before
all
men
sometimes
furtively
before
dabbing
my
eyes
with
a
wet
and
gasping
for
breath
i
did
not
care
where
my
feet
led
me
i
would
go
back
to
school
no
more
i
had
played
truant
for
three
days
before
the
discovered
that
i
had
not
returned
to
school
they
treated
me
with
that
extraordinary
consideration
that
they
always
extended
to
our
great
crimes
and
never
to
our
little
sins
of
thoughtlessness
or
high
spirits
the
doctor
saw
me
i
was
told
that
i
would
be
sent
to
a
country
school
after
the
next
holidays
and
meanwhile
i
was
allowed
to
return
to
my
sofa
and
my
dreams
i
lay
there
and
read
dickens
and
was
very
happy
as
a
rule
the
cat
kept
me
company
and
i
was
pleased
with
his
placid
society
though
he
made
my
legs
cramped
i
thought
that
i
too
would
like
to
be
a
cat
the
new
boy
i
when
i
left
home
to
go
to
for
the
first
time
i
did
not
cry
like
the
little
boys
in
the
though
i
had
never
been
away
from
home
before
except
to
spend
holidays
with
relatives
this
was
not
due
to
any
extraordinary
on
my
part
for
i
was
always
ready
to
shed
tears
on
the
most
trivial
occasion
but
as
a
fact
i
had
other
things
to
think
about
and
did
not
in
the
least
realise
the
significance
of
my
journey
i
had
lots
of
new
clothes
and
more
money
in
my
pocket
than
i
had
ever
had
before
and
in
the
guard
van
at
the
back
of
the
train
there
was
a
large
box
that
i
had
packed
myself
with
jam
and
potted
meat
and
cake
in
this
as
in
other
matters
i
had
been
aided
by
the
expert
advice
of
a
brother
who
was
himself
at
a
school
in
the
north
and
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
in
the
comfortable
security
of
the
holidays
he
should
have
given
me
an
almost
lyrical
account
of
the
joys
of
life
at
a
moreover
my
existence
as
a
in
london
had
been
so
unhappy
that
i
was
prepared
to
welcome
any
change
so
at
most
i
felt
only
a
vague
unease
as
to
the
future
after
i
had
glanced
at
my
papers
i
sat
back
and
stared
at
my
eldest
brother
who
had
been
told
off
to
see
me
safely
to
school
at
that
time
i
did
not
like
him
because
he
seemed
to
me
unduly
insistent
on
his
rights
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
at
the
tactlessness
of
the
people
in
choosing
him
as
my
travelling
companion
with
any
one
else
this
journey
might
have
been
a
joyous
affair
but
there
were
incidents
between
us
that
neither
of
us
would
forget
so
that
i
could
find
nothing
better
than
an
awkward
politeness
with
which
to
meet
his
strained
amiability
he
feigned
an
intense
interest
in
his
magazine
while
i
looked
out
of
window
with
one
finger
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
scratching
the
comfortable
milled
edges
of
my
money
when
i
saw
little
forgotten
in
the
green
dimples
of
the
kentish
hills
i
thought
that
it
would
be
nice
to
live
there
with
a
room
full
of
away
from
the
discomforts
and
difficulties
of
life
like
a
cat
i
wanted
to
dream
somewhere
where
i
would
not
be
trodden
on
somewhere
where
i
would
be
neglected
by
friends
and
foes
alike
this
was
my
normal
desire
but
side
by
side
with
my
craving
for
peace
i
was
aware
of
a
new
and
interesting
emotion
that
suggested
the
possibility
of
a
life
even
more
agreeable
the
excitement
of
packing
my
box
with
provender
like
a
sailor
who
was
going
on
a
long
voyage
the
unwonted
thrill
of
having
a
large
sum
of
money
concealed
about
my
person
and
above
all
the
imaginative
yarns
of
my
elder
brother
had
fired
me
with
the
thought
of
adventure
his
stories
had
been
filled
with
an
utter
contempt
for
lessons
and
a
superb
defiance
of
the
authorities
and
had
ranged
from
desperate
parties
on
the
yorkshire
wolds
to
illicit
feasts
of
eccles
cakes
and
tinned
lobster
in
moonlit
dormitories
i
thought
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
experience
this
romantic
kind
of
life
before
settling
down
for
good
with
my
dreams
the
train
wandered
on
and
my
eldest
brother
and
i
looked
at
each
other
constrainedly
he
had
already
asked
me
twice
whether
i
had
my
ticket
and
i
realised
that
he
could
not
think
of
any
other
neutral
remark
that
fitted
the
occasion
it
occurred
to
me
to
say
that
the
train
was
slow
but
i
remembered
with
a
glow
of
anger
how
he
had
once
rubbed
a
strawberry
in
my
face
because
i
had
taken
the
liberty
of
offering
it
to
one
of
his
friends
and
i
held
my
peace
i
had
prayed
for
his
death
every
night
for
three
weeks
after
that
and
though
he
was
still
alive
the
knowledge
of
my
unconfessed
and
unrepented
wickedness
prevented
me
from
being
more
than
conveniently
polite
he
thought
i
was
a
cheeky
little
toad
and
i
thought
he
was
a
bully
so
we
looked
at
each
other
and
did
not
speak
we
were
both
glad
therefore
when
the
train
pulled
up
at
the
station
that
bore
the
name
of
my
new
school
my
first
emotion
was
a
keen
regret
that
my
parents
had
not
sent
me
to
a
place
where
the
sun
shone
as
we
sat
in
the
little
omnibus
that
carried
us
from
the
station
to
the
town
with
my
precious
boxes
safely
stored
on
the
roof
we
passed
between
grey
fields
whose
featureless
expanses
melted
changelessly
into
the
grey
sky
overhead
the
prospect
alarmed
me
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
not
a
likely
world
for
adventures
nor
was
i
reassured
by
the
sight
of
the
town
whose
one
long
street
of
low
houses
struck
me
as
being
mean
and
sordid
i
was
conscious
that
the
place
had
an
unpleasant
smell
and
i
was
already
driven
to
thinking
of
my
and
my
agreeable
thoughts
which
i
had
made
up
my
mind
in
the
train
to
reserve
carefully
for
possible
hours
of
unhappiness
but
the
low
roof
of
the
omnibus
was
like
a
limit
to
my
imagination
and
my
body
was
troubled
by
the
displeasing
contact
of
the
velvet
cushions
i
was
still
wondering
why
this
made
my
wrists
ache
when
the
omnibus
lurched
from
the
cobbles
on
to
a
gravel
drive
and
i
saw
the
school
buildings
towering
all
about
me
like
the
walls
of
a
prison
i
jumped
out
and
stretched
my
legs
while
the
driver
climbed
down
to
collect
the
fares
he
looked
at
me
without
a
jot
of
interest
and
i
knew
that
he
must
have
driven
a
great
many
boys
from
the
station
to
the
school
in
the
course
of
his
life
a
man
appeared
in
of
grey
flannel
and
wheeled
my
boxes
away
on
a
little
truck
and
after
a
while
a
master
came
down
and
showed
us
in
a
perfunctory
manner
over
the
more
presentable
quarters
of
the
school
my
brother
was
anxious
to
get
away
because
he
had
not
been
emancipated
long
enough
to
find
the
atmosphere
of
dormitories
and
agreeable
i
was
naturally
interested
in
my
new
environment
but
the
presence
of
the
master
constrained
me
and
i
was
afraid
to
speak
in
front
of
this
unknown
man
whom
it
was
my
lot
to
obey
so
we
were
all
relieved
when
our
hurried
inspection
was
over
he
told
me
that
i
was
at
liberty
to
do
what
i
pleased
till
seven
so
i
went
for
a
walk
through
the
town
with
my
brother
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
chill
grey
close
and
the
town
was
filled
with
a
clammy
mist
tainted
with
the
odour
of
sewage
due
i
afterwards
discovered
to
the
popular
abuse
of
the
little
stream
that
gave
the
place
its
name
even
my
brother
could
not
entirely
escape
the
melancholy
influence
of
the
hour
and
the
place
and
he
was
glad
to
take
me
into
a
baker
shop
and
have
tea
by
now
the
illusion
of
adventure
that
had
reconciled
me
to
leaving
home
was
in
a
desperate
state
and
i
drank
my
tea
and
consumed
my
cakes
without
enjoyment
if
life
was
always
going
to
be
the
same
if
in
fleeing
one
misfortune
i
had
merely
brought
on
myself
the
pain
of
becoming
accustomed
to
another
i
felt
sure
that
my
meagre
stoicism
would
not
suffice
to
carry
me
through
with
credit
i
had
failed
once
i
would
fail
again
i
looked
forward
with
a
sinking
heart
to
a
tearful
and
uncomfortable
future
there
was
only
a
very
poor
train
service
so
my
brother
had
plenty
of
time
to
walk
back
to
the
station
and
it
was
settled
that
i
should
go
part
of
the
way
with
him
as
we
walked
along
the
white
road
that
stretched
between
uniform
hedgerows
of
a
shadowy
greyness
i
saw
that
he
had
something
on
his
mind
in
this
hour
of
my
trial
i
was
willing
to
forget
the
past
for
the
sake
of
talking
for
a
few
minutes
with
some
human
being
whom
i
knew
but
he
returned
only
vague
answers
to
my
eager
questions
at
last
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
said
i
had
better
turn
back
i
would
liked
to
have
walked
farther
with
him
but
i
was
above
all
things
anxious
to
keep
up
appearances
so
i
said
goodbye
in
as
composed
a
voice
as
i
could
find
my
brother
hesitated
for
a
minute
then
with
a
timid
glance
at
heaven
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
pulled
out
half
a
crown
which
he
gave
me
and
walked
rapidly
away
i
saw
in
a
flash
that
for
him
too
it
had
been
an
important
moment
he
had
tipped
his
first
schoolboy
and
henceforth
he
was
beyond
all
question
grown
up
i
did
not
like
him
but
i
watched
him
disappear
in
the
dusk
with
a
desolate
heart
at
that
moment
he
stood
for
a
great
many
things
that
seemed
valuable
to
me
and
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
walking
by
his
side
with
my
face
towards
home
and
my
back
turned
to
the
grey
and
unsavoury
town
to
which
i
had
to
bear
my
despondent
loneliness
nevertheless
i
stepped
out
staunchly
enough
in
order
that
my
mind
should
take
courage
from
the
example
of
my
body
i
thought
strenuously
of
my
brother
stories
of
my
packed
for
a
voyage
of
the
money
in
my
pocket
increased
now
by
my
eldest
brother
unexpected
generosity
and
by
dint
of
these
violent
mental
exercises
i
had
reduced
my
mind
to
a
comfortable
stupor
by
the
time
i
reached
the
school
gates
there
i
was
overcome
by
shyness
and
although
i
saw
lights
in
the
and
heard
the
voices
of
boys
i
stood
awkwardly
in
the
playground
not
knowing
where
i
ought
to
go
the
mist
in
the
air
surrounded
the
lights
with
a
halo
and
my
nostrils
were
filled
with
the
acrid
smell
of
burning
leaves
i
had
stood
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
perhaps
when
a
boy
came
up
and
spoke
to
me
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
gave
me
a
shock
i
think
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
boy
had
spoken
kindly
to
me
he
asked
me
my
name
and
told
me
that
it
would
be
in
five
minutes
so
that
i
could
go
and
sit
in
the
and
wait
you
be
all
right
you
know
he
said
as
he
passed
on
not
a
bad
lot
of
chaps
the
revulsion
nearly
brought
on
a
catastrophe
for
the
tears
rose
to
my
eyes
and
i
gazed
after
him
with
a
swimming
head
i
had
prepared
myself
to
receive
blows
and
insults
with
a
calm
brow
but
i
had
no
armour
with
which
to
oppose
the
noble
weapons
of
sympathy
and
good
fellowship
they
overcame
the
stubborn
hatred
with
which
i
was
accustomed
to
meet
life
and
left
me
defenceless
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
face
to
face
with
the
hero
of
a
dream
as
i
sat
at
supper
before
a
long
table
decorated
with
plates
of
and
cheese
i
saw
my
friend
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
so
i
asked
the
boy
next
to
me
to
tell
me
his
name
oh
he
said
looking
curiously
at
my
blushes
you
mean
old
mother
f
he
pious
you
know
reads
the
bible
and
funks
at
games
and
all
that
there
are
some
things
which
no
schoolboy
can
afford
to
forgive
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
not
pleasant
to
be
an
ishmael
that
as
far
as
possible
i
would
try
to
be
an
ordinary
boy
at
my
new
school
my
experiences
in
london
had
taught
me
caution
and
i
was
anxious
not
to
compromise
my
position
at
the
outset
by
making
an
unpopular
friend
so
i
nodded
my
head
sagely
in
reply
and
looked
at
my
hero
with
an
air
of
profound
contempt
ii
the
days
that
followed
were
not
so
uncomfortable
as
my
first
grey
impression
of
the
place
had
led
me
to
expect
i
proved
to
my
own
intense
astonishment
to
be
rather
good
at
lessons
so
that
i
got
on
well
with
the
masters
and
the
boys
were
kind
enough
in
their
careless
way
i
had
plenty
of
and
though
i
did
not
shine
at
association
football
for
in
london
i
had
only
watched
the
big
boys
playing
rugby
i
was
not
afraid
of
being
knocked
about
which
was
all
that
was
expected
of
a
new
boy
most
of
my
embarrassments
were
due
to
the
sensitiveness
that
made
me
dislike
asking
questions
a
weakness
that
was
always
placing
me
in
false
positions
but
my
efforts
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
the
boys
were
not
unsuccessful
and
while
i
looked
in
vain
for
anything
like
the
romantic
adventures
of
which
my
brother
had
spoken
i
sometimes
found
myself
almost
enjoying
my
new
life
and
then
as
the
children
say
in
the
streets
of
london
i
woke
up
and
discovered
that
i
was
desperately
partly
no
doubt
this
was
due
to
a
natural
reaction
but
there
were
other
more
obvious
causes
for
one
thing
my
lavish
hospitality
had
exhausted
my
in
the
first
three
weeks
and
i
was
ashamed
to
write
home
for
more
so
soon
this
speedy
end
to
my
apparent
wealth
certainly
made
it
easier
for
the
boys
to
find
out
that
i
was
not
one
of
themselves
and
they
began
to
look
at
me
askance
and
leave
me
out
of
their
conversations
i
was
made
to
feel
once
more
that
i
had
been
born
under
a
malignant
star
that
did
not
allow
me
to
speak
or
act
as
they
did
i
had
not
their
common
sense
their
blunt
cheerfulness
their
complete
lack
of
sensibility
and
while
they
resented
my
queerness
they
could
not
know
how
anxious
i
was
to
be
an
ordinary
boy
when
i
saw
that
they
mistrusted
me
i
was
too
proud
to
accept
the
crumbs
of
their
society
like
poor
mother
f
and
i
withdrew
myself
into
a
solitude
that
gave
me
far
too
much
time
in
which
to
examine
my
emotions
i
found
out
all
the
remote
corners
of
the
school
in
which
it
was
possible
to
be
alone
and
when
the
other
boys
went
for
walks
in
the
fields
i
stayed
in
the
churchyard
close
to
the
school
disturbing
the
sheep
in
their
meditations
among
the
and
thinking
what
a
long
time
it
would
be
before
i
was
old
enough
to
die
now
that
the
first
freshness
of
my
new
environment
had
worn
off
i
was
able
to
see
my
life
as
a
series
of
grey
pictures
that
repeated
themselves
day
by
day
in
my
mind
these
pictures
were
marked
off
from
each
other
by
a
sound
of
bells
i
woke
in
the
morning
in
a
bed
that
was
like
all
the
other
beds
and
lay
on
my
back
listening
to
the
soft
noises
of
sleep
that
filled
the
air
with
rumours
of
healthy
boys
the
bell
would
ring
and
the
dormitory
would
break
into
an
uproar
splashing
of
water
dropping
of
and
shouts
of
laughter
for
these
could
laugh
before
breakfast
then
we
all
trooped
downstairs
and
i
forced
myself
to
drink
bad
coffee
in
a
room
that
smelt
of
herrings
the
next
bell
called
us
to
chapel
and
at
intervals
during
the
morning
other
bells
called
us
from
one
class
to
another
dinner
was
the
one
square
meal
we
had
during
the
day
and
as
it
was
always
very
good
and
there
was
nothing
morbid
about
my
appetite
i
looked
forward
to
it
with
interest
after
dinner
we
played
football
i
liked
the
game
well
enough
but
the
atmosphere
of
mud
and
forlorn
grey
fields
made
me
shudder
and
as
i
kept
goal
i
spent
my
leisure
moments
in
hardening
my
æesthetic
impressions
i
never
see
the
word
football
today
without
recalling
the
curious
sensation
caused
by
the
mud
drying
on
my
bare
knees
after
football
were
other
classes
classes
in
which
it
was
sometimes
very
hard
to
keep
awake
for
the
school
was
old
and
the
badly
ventilated
were
stuffy
after
the
fresh
air
then
the
bell
summoned
us
to
evening
chapel
and
tea
a
meal
which
we
were
allowed
to
improve
with
sardines
and
eggs
and
jam
if
we
had
money
to
buy
them
or
a
hamper
from
home
after
tea
we
had
about
two
hours
to
ourselves
and
then
came
preparation
and
supper
and
bed
everything
was
heralded
by
a
bell
and
now
and
again
even
in
the
midst
of
lessons
i
would
hear
the
tolling
for
a
funeral
i
think
my
hatred
of
bells
dated
back
to
my
early
childhood
when
the
village
church
having
only
three
bells
played
the
first
bar
of
three
blind
mice
a
million
times
every
sunday
evening
till
i
could
have
cried
for
monotony
and
the
vexation
of
the
thwarted
tune
but
at
school
i
had
to
pay
the
penalty
for
my
prejudice
every
hour
of
the
day
especially
i
suffered
at
night
during
preparation
when
they
rang
the
curfew
on
the
church
bells
at
intolerable
length
for
these
were
tranquil
hours
to
which
i
looked
forward
eagerly
we
prepared
our
lessons
for
the
morrow
in
the
great
hall
and
i
would
spread
my
books
out
on
the
desk
and
let
my
legs
dangle
from
the
form
in
a
spirit
of
contentment
for
the
troubled
day
happily
past
over
my
head
the
gas
stars
burned
quietly
and
all
about
me
i
heard
the
restrained
breathing
of
comrades
like
a
noise
of
fluttering
moths
and
then
suddenly
the
first
stroke
of
the
curfew
would
snarl
through
the
air
filling
the
roof
with
nasal
echoes
and
troubling
the
quietude
of
my
mind
with
insistent
vibrations
i
derived
small
satisfaction
from
cursing
william
the
conqueror
who
the
history
book
told
me
was
responsible
for
this
ingenious
tyranny
the
long
pauses
between
the
strokes
held
me
in
a
state
of
strained
expectancy
until
i
wanted
to
howl
i
would
look
about
me
for
sympathy
and
see
the
boys
at
their
lessons
and
the
master
on
duty
reading
quietly
at
his
table
the
curfew
rang
every
night
and
they
did
not
notice
it
at
all
the
only
bell
i
liked
to
hear
was
the
last
bell
that
called
us
to
our
brief
supper
and
to
bed
for
once
the
light
was
out
and
my
body
was
between
the
sheets
i
was
free
to
do
what
i
would
free
to
think
or
to
dream
or
to
cry
there
was
no
real
difference
between
being
in
bed
at
school
or
anywhere
else
and
sometimes
i
would
fill
the
shadows
of
the
dormitory
with
the
familiar
furniture
of
my
little
bedroom
at
home
and
pretend
that
i
was
happy
but
as
a
rule
i
came
to
bed
brimming
over
with
the
day
tears
and
i
would
pull
the
bedclothes
over
my
head
so
that
the
other
boys
should
not
know
that
i
was
homesick
and
cry
until
i
was
sticky
with
tears
and
perspiration
the
discipline
at
school
did
not
make
us
good
boys
but
it
made
us
civilised
it
taught
us
to
conceal
our
crimes
and
as
was
justly
regarded
as
a
crime
of
ingratitude
to
the
authorities
and
to
society
in
general
i
had
to
restrain
my
physical
weakness
during
the
day
and
the
reaction
from
this
restraint
made
my
tears
at
night
almost
a
luxury
my
longing
for
home
was
founded
on
trifles
but
it
was
not
the
less
passionate
i
hated
this
life
spent
in
walking
on
bare
boards
and
the
blank
walls
and
polished
forms
of
the
school
appeared
to
me
to
be
sordid
when
now
and
again
i
went
into
one
of
the
master
studies
and
felt
a
carpet
under
my
feet
and
saw
a
pleasant
litter
of
pipes
and
novels
lying
on
the
table
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
in
a
holy
place
and
i
looked
at
the
hearthrug
the
wallpaper
and
the
upholstered
chairs
with
a
kind
of
desolate
love
for
things
that
were
nice
to
see
and
touch
i
suppose
that
if
we
had
been
in
a
workhouse
a
prison
or
a
lunatic
asylum
our
æesthetic
environment
would
have
been
very
much
the
same
as
it
was
at
school
and
afterwards
when
i
went
with
the
cricket
and
football
teams
to
other
grammar
schools
they
all
gave
me
the
same
impression
of
clean
ugliness
it
is
not
surprising
that
few
boys
emerge
from
their
school
life
with
that
feeling
for
colour
and
form
which
is
common
to
nearly
all
children
there
was
something
very
unpleasant
to
me
in
the
fact
that
we
all
washed
with
the
same
kind
of
soap
drank
out
of
the
same
kind
of
cup
and
in
general
did
the
same
things
at
the
same
time
the
school
timetable
robbed
life
of
all
those
accidental
variations
that
make
it
interesting
our
meals
our
games
even
our
hours
of
freedom
seemed
only
like
subtle
lessons
we
had
to
eat
at
a
certain
hour
whether
we
were
hungry
or
not
we
had
to
play
at
a
certain
hour
when
perhaps
we
wanted
to
sit
still
and
be
quiet
the
whole
school
discipline
tended
to
the
formation
of
habits
at
the
expense
of
our
reasoning
faculties
yet
the
astonishing
thing
to
me
was
that
the
boys
themselves
set
up
standards
of
conduct
that
still
further
narrowed
the
possibilities
of
our
life
it
was
bad
form
to
read
too
much
to
write
home
except
on
sundays
to
work
outside
the
appointed
hours
to
talk
to
the
to
cultivate
social
relationships
with
the
masters
to
be
cambridge
in
the
and
in
fine
to
hold
any
opinion
or
follow
any
pursuit
that
was
not
approved
by
the
majority
it
was
only
by
hiding
myself
away
in
corners
that
i
could
enjoy
any
liberty
of
spirit
and
though
my
thoughts
were
often
cheerless
when
i
remembered
the
relative
freedom
of
home
life
i
preferred
to
linger
with
them
rather
than
to
weary
myself
in
breaking
the
little
laws
of
a
society
for
which
i
was
in
no
way
fitted
these
were
black
days
rendered
blacker
by
my
morbid
fear
of
the
physical
weakness
that
made
me
liable
to
cry
at
any
moment
sometimes
even
without
in
the
least
knowing
why
i
was
often
on
the
brink
of
disaster
but
my
fear
of
the
boys
ridicule
prevented
me
from
publicly
disgracing
myself
once
the
headmaster
called
a
boy
into
his
study
and
he
came
out
afterwards
with
red
eyelids
and
a
puffed
face
when
they
heard
that
his
mother
had
died
suddenly
in
india
all
the
boys
thought
that
these
manifestations
of
sorrow
were
very
creditable
and
in
the
best
of
taste
especially
as
he
did
not
let
anybody
see
him
crying
for
my
part
i
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
envy
this
boy
who
could
flaunt
his
woe
where
he
would
i
too
had
my
unassuageable
sorrow
for
the
home
that
was
dead
to
me
those
forlorn
days
but
i
could
only
express
it
among
the
tombs
in
the
churchyard
or
at
night
muffled
between
the
blankets
when
the
silent
dormitory
seemed
to
listen
with
suspicious
ears
iii
a
consoling
scrap
of
wisdom
which
unfortunately
children
do
not
find
written
large
in
their
copybooks
is
that
sorrow
is
as
transitory
as
happiness
although
my
childhood
was
strewn
with
the
memorial
wreaths
of
dead
miseries
i
always
had
a
morbid
sense
that
my
present
discomforts
were
immortal
so
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
continue
to
be
unhappy
at
school
when
the
intervention
of
two
beings
whom
i
had
thought
utterly
remote
from
me
gave
me
a
new
philosophy
and
reconciled
me
to
life
the
first
was
a
master
who
found
me
grieving
in
one
of
my
oubliettes
and
took
me
into
his
study
and
tried
to
draw
me
out
kindness
always
made
me
ineloquent
and
as
i
sat
in
his
big
basket
chair
and
sniffed
the
delightful
odour
of
his
pipe
i
expressed
myself
chiefly
in
monosyllables
and
hiccoughs
nevertheless
he
seemed
to
understand
me
very
well
and
though
he
did
not
say
much
i
felt
by
the
way
in
which
he
puffed
out
great
generous
clouds
of
smoke
that
he
sympathised
with
me
he
told
me
to
come
and
see
him
twice
a
week
and
that
i
was
at
liberty
to
read
any
of
his
books
and
in
general
gave
me
a
sense
that
i
was
unfortunate
rather
than
criminal
this
did
me
good
because
a
large
part
of
my
unhappiness
was
due
to
the
fact
that
constant
suppression
by
majorities
had
robbed
me
of
my
it
is
better
for
a
boy
to
be
conceited
than
to
be
ashamed
of
his
own
nature
and
to
shudder
when
he
sees
his
face
reflected
in
a
glass
my
second
benefactor
was
nominally
a
boy
though
in
reality
he
was
nearly
as
old
as
the
master
and
was
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
term
to
go
up
to
oxford
he
took
me
by
the
shoulder
one
evening
in
the
dusk
and
walked
me
round
and
round
the
big
clump
of
rhododendrons
that
stood
in
the
drive
in
front
of
the
school
i
did
not
understand
half
he
said
but
to
my
great
astonishment
i
heard
him
confessing
that
he
had
always
been
unhappy
at
school
although
at
the
end
he
was
captain
in
lessons
in
games
in
everything
i
was
of
course
highly
flattered
that
this
giant
should
speak
to
me
as
an
equal
and
admit
me
to
his
confidences
but
i
was
even
more
delighted
with
the
encouraging
light
he
threw
on
school
life
you
only
here
for
a
little
spell
you
know
you
be
surprised
how
short
it
is
and
do
be
miserable
just
because
you
different
i
different
a
jolly
good
thing
to
be
different
i
was
not
used
to
people
who
took
this
wide
view
of
circumstance
and
his
voice
in
the
shadows
sounded
like
some
one
speaking
in
a
yet
although
his
monologue
gave
me
an
entirely
new
conception
of
life
no
more
of
it
lingers
in
my
mind
save
his
last
reflective
criticism
all
the
same
i
do
see
why
you
should
always
have
dirty
nails
he
never
confided
in
me
again
and
i
would
have
died
rather
than
have
reminded
him
of
his
kindly
indiscretion
but
when
he
passed
me
in
the
playground
he
seemed
to
look
at
me
with
a
kind
of
reticent
interest
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
after
all
my
queerness
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
might
even
be
something
to
be
proud
of
the
value
of
this
discovery
to
me
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
hitherto
in
my
relationships
with
the
boys
i
had
fought
nothing
but
losing
battles
for
i
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
they
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
but
now
that
i
had
hit
on
the
astonishing
theory
that
the
individual
has
the
right
to
think
for
himself
i
saw
quite
clearly
that
most
of
their
standards
of
conduct
sprang
from
their
stupidity
they
moved
in
flocks
because
they
had
not
the
courage
to
choose
a
line
for
themselves
the
material
result
of
this
new
theory
of
life
was
to
make
me
enormously
conceited
and
i
moved
among
my
comrades
with
a
mysterious
confidence
and
gave
myself
the
airs
of
a
byron
in
knickerbockers
my
unpopularity
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
but
so
did
my
moral
courage
and
i
accepted
the
belated
efforts
of
my
to
knock
the
intelligence
out
of
me
as
so
many
tributes
to
the
force
of
my
individuality
i
no
longer
cried
in
my
bed
at
night
but
lay
awake
enraptured
at
the
profundity
of
my
thoughts
after
years
of
unquestioning
humility
i
enjoyed
a
prolonged
debauch
of
intellectual
pride
and
i
marvelled
at
the
little
boy
of
yesterday
who
had
wept
because
he
could
not
be
an
imbecile
it
was
the
apotheosis
of
the
ugly
duckling
and
i
saw
my
swan
plumage
reflected
in
the
placid
faces
of
the
boys
around
me
as
in
the
vacant
waters
of
a
pool
as
yet
i
did
not
dream
of
a
moulting
season
still
less
that
a
day
would
come
when
i
should
envy
the
ducks
their
domestic
ease
and
the
unthinking
tranquillity
of
their
lives
a
little
boy
may
be
excused
for
not
realising
that
hans
story
is
only
the
prelude
to
a
sadder
story
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
write
my
new
freedom
of
spirit
gave
me
courage
to
the
emotional
and
æesthetic
values
of
my
environment
i
could
not
persuade
myself
that
i
liked
the
sound
of
bells
and
the
greyness
of
the
country
in
still
revolted
me
as
though
i
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
cheerful
reds
and
greens
and
blues
of
the
that
filled
my
mind
as
a
child
with
dreams
of
a
delightful
world
but
now
that
i
was
wise
enough
to
make
the
best
of
my
unboyish
emotionalism
i
began
to
take
pleasure
in
certain
phases
of
though
i
was
devoid
of
any
recognisable
religious
sense
i
liked
the
wide
words
in
the
psalms
that
we
read
at
night
in
the
school
chapel
this
was
not
due
to
any
precocious
recognition
of
their
poetry
but
to
the
fact
that
their
intense
imagery
conjured
up
all
sorts
of
precious
visions
in
my
mind
i
could
see
the
hart
panting
after
the
in
the
valleys
of
exmoor
where
i
had
once
spent
an
enchanted
holiday
i
could
see
the
men
going
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
and
the
stormy
waves
and
the
staggering
fearful
mariners
for
i
had
witnessed
a
great
tempest
off
flamborough
head
even
such
vague
phrases
as
the
hills
gave
me
an
intense
joy
i
could
see
them
so
clearly
those
hills
chalky
hills
covered
with
wild
pansies
and
with
an
sky
overhead
like
the
lid
of
a
i
liked
too
the
services
in
the
old
church
on
sunday
nights
when
the
lights
were
lowered
for
the
sermon
and
i
would
put
my
hands
over
my
ears
and
hear
the
voice
of
the
preacher
like
the
drone
of
a
distant
bee
after
church
the
choral
society
used
to
practise
in
the
great
hall
and
as
i
walked
round
the
school
buildings
snatches
of
their
singing
would
beat
against
my
face
like
sudden
gusts
of
wind
when
i
listened
at
the
doors
of
my
i
heard
the
boys
talking
about
football
matches
or
indulging
their
tireless
passion
for
unimaginative
personalities
i
would
stand
on
the
mat
outside
wondering
whether
i
would
be
allowed
to
read
if
i
went
in
i
looked
forward
to
tuesday
night
which
was
my
almost
as
much
as
to
sunday
the
school
sanitary
arrangements
were
primitive
and
all
the
water
had
to
be
fetched
in
pails
and
i
used
to
like
to
see
the
man
tipping
the
hot
water
into
the
bath
and
flinging
his
great
body
back
to
avoid
the
steam
that
made
his
grey
flannel
cling
to
his
hairy
arms
most
of
the
boys
added
a
lot
of
cold
water
but
i
liked
to
boil
myself
because
the
subsequent
languor
was
so
pleasant
the
matron
would
bring
our
own
bath
towels
warm
from
the
fire
and
i
would
press
mine
against
my
face
because
it
smelt
of
childhood
and
of
home
i
always
thought
my
body
looked
pretty
after
a
really
hot
bath
its
rosiness
enabled
me
to
forgive
myself
for
being
fat
one
very
strong
impression
was
connected
with
the
only
master
in
the
school
whom
i
did
not
like
he
was
a
german
and
as
is
the
case
with
others
of
his
nationality
a
spray
of
saliva
flew
from
his
lips
when
he
was
angry
and
seeing
this
i
would
edge
away
from
him
in
alarm
perhaps
it
was
on
this
account
that
he
treated
me
with
systematic
unfairness
and
set
himself
the
unnecessary
task
of
making
me
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
boys
one
night
i
was
wandering
in
the
playground
and
heard
him
playing
the
violin
in
his
study
my
taste
in
music
was
barbarian
i
liked
comic
songs
which
i
used
to
sing
to
myself
in
a
lugubrious
voice
and
in
london
the
plaintive
clamour
of
the
had
helped
to
make
my
sorrows
rhythmical
but
now
perhaps
for
the
first
time
i
became
aware
of
the
illimitable
melancholy
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
all
great
music
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
german
master
the
man
whom
i
hated
had
shut
himself
up
alone
in
his
study
and
was
crying
aloud
i
knew
that
if
he
was
unhappy
it
must
be
because
he
too
was
an
ishmael
a
personality
one
of
the
different
ones
a
great
sympathy
woke
within
me
and
i
peeped
through
the
window
and
saw
him
playing
with
his
face
all
shiny
with
perspiration
and
a
silk
handkerchief
tucked
under
his
chin
i
would
have
liked
to
have
knocked
at
his
door
and
told
him
that
i
knew
all
about
these
things
but
i
was
afraid
that
he
would
think
me
cheeky
and
splutter
in
my
face
the
next
day
in
his
class
i
looked
at
him
hopefully
in
the
light
of
my
new
understanding
but
it
did
not
seem
to
make
any
difference
he
only
told
me
to
get
on
with
my
work
the
term
drew
to
a
close
and
most
of
the
boys
in
my
ticked
off
the
days
on
lists
in
which
the
sundays
were
written
in
red
ink
to
show
that
they
did
not
really
count
as
time
went
on
they
grew
more
and
more
boisterous
and
wherever
i
went
i
heard
them
telling
one
another
how
they
were
going
to
spend
their
holidays
it
was
surprising
to
me
that
these
boys
who
were
so
ordinary
during
should
lead
such
adventurous
lives
in
the
holidays
and
i
felt
a
little
envious
of
their
good
fortune
they
talked
of
visiting
the
theatre
and
foreign
travel
in
a
way
that
made
me
think
that
perhaps
after
all
my
was
incomplete
i
had
never
been
out
of
england
and
my
dramatic
knowledge
was
limited
to
pantomimes
for
which
these
enthusiastic
students
of
musical
comedy
expressed
a
large
contempt
some
of
them
were
allowed
to
shoot
with
real
guns
in
the
holidays
which
reminded
me
of
the
worst
excesses
of
my
brother
in
yorkshire
examining
my
own
life
i
had
often
come
to
the
conclusion
that
adventures
did
not
exist
outside
books
but
the
boys
shook
this
comforting
theory
with
their
boastful
prophecies
and
i
thought
once
more
that
perhaps
it
was
my
misfortune
that
they
did
not
happen
to
me
i
began
to
fear
that
i
would
find
the
holidays
tame
there
were
other
considerations
that
made
me
look
forward
to
the
end
of
the
term
with
misgiving
since
it
had
been
made
plain
to
me
that
i
was
a
remarkable
boy
i
had
rather
enjoyed
my
life
at
school
i
had
conceived
myself
as
strutting
with
a
measured
dignity
before
a
background
of
the
other
boys
a
background
that
moved
and
did
not
change
like
a
tapestry
but
i
was
quite
sure
that
i
would
not
be
allowed
to
give
myself
airs
at
home
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
youngest
brother
portion
of
freedom
would
compare
but
poorly
with
the
measure
of
intellectual
liberty
that
i
had
secured
for
myself
at
school
my
brothers
were
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
i
would
be
expected
to
take
my
place
in
the
background
and
do
what
i
was
told
i
should
miss
my
sense
of
being
superior
to
my
environment
and
my
intensely
emotional
sundays
would
no
longer
divide
time
into
weeks
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
i
realised
that
i
did
not
want
to
go
home
on
the
last
night
of
the
term
when
the
dormitory
had
at
length
become
quiet
i
considered
the
whole
case
dispassionately
in
my
bed
the
labour
of
packing
my
and
writing
labels
for
my
luggage
had
given
me
a
momentary
thrill
but
for
the
rest
i
had
moved
among
my
insurgent
comrades
with
a
chilled
heart
i
knew
now
that
i
was
too
greedy
of
life
that
i
always
thought
of
the
pleasant
side
of
things
when
they
were
no
longer
within
my
grasp
but
at
the
i
same
time
my
discontent
was
not
wholly
unreasonable
i
had
learnt
more
of
myself
in
three
months
than
i
had
in
all
my
life
before
and
from
being
a
nervous
hysterical
boy
i
had
arrived
at
a
complete
understanding
of
my
emotions
which
i
studied
with
an
almost
adult
calmness
of
mind
i
knew
that
in
returning
to
the
society
of
my
healthy
boyish
brothers
i
was
going
back
to
a
kind
of
life
for
which
i
was
no
longer
fitted
i
had
changed
but
i
had
the
sense
to
see
that
it
was
a
change
that
would
not
appeal
to
them
and
that
in
consequence
i
would
have
another
and
harder
battle
to
fight
before
i
was
allowed
to
go
my
own
way
i
saw
further
still
i
saw
that
after
a
month
at
home
i
would
not
want
to
come
back
to
school
and
that
i
should
have
to
endure
another
period
of
despondency
i
saw
that
my
whole
school
life
would
be
punctuated
by
these
violent
uprootings
that
the
alternation
of
and
holidays
would
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
change
life
into
a
comfortable
habit
and
that
even
to
the
end
of
my
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
preserve
my
courage
as
i
lay
thinking
in
the
dark
i
was
proud
of
the
clarity
of
my
mind
and
glad
that
i
had
at
last
outwitted
the
tears
that
had
made
my
childhood
so
unhappy
i
heard
the
boys
breathing
softly
around
me
those
wonderful
boys
who
could
sleep
even
when
they
were
excited
and
i
felt
that
i
was
getting
the
better
of
them
in
thinking
while
they
slept
i
remembered
the
prefect
who
had
told
me
that
we
were
there
only
for
a
spell
but
i
did
not
speculate
as
to
what
would
follow
afterwards
all
that
i
had
to
do
was
to
watch
myself
ceaselessly
and
be
able
to
explain
to
myself
everything
that
i
felt
i
and
did
in
that
way
i
should
always
be
strong
i
enough
to
guard
my
weaknesses
from
the
eyes
of
the
jealous
world
in
which
i
moved
the
church
bells
chimed
the
hour
and
i
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
on
the
brighton
road
slowly
the
sun
had
climbed
up
the
hard
white
downs
till
it
broke
with
little
of
the
mysterious
ritual
of
dawn
upon
a
sparkling
world
of
snow
there
had
been
a
hard
frost
during
the
night
and
the
birds
who
hopped
about
here
and
there
with
scant
tolerance
of
life
left
no
trace
of
their
passage
on
the
silver
pavements
in
places
the
sheltered
caverns
of
the
hedges
broke
the
monotony
of
the
whiteness
that
had
fallen
upon
the
coloured
earth
and
overhead
the
sky
melted
from
orange
to
deep
blue
from
deep
blue
to
a
blue
so
pale
that
it
suggested
a
thin
paper
screen
rather
than
illimitable
space
across
the
level
fields
there
came
a
cold
silent
wind
which
blew
a
fine
dust
of
snow
from
the
trees
but
hardly
stirred
the
crested
hedges
once
above
the
skyline
the
sun
seemed
to
climb
more
quickly
and
as
it
rose
higher
it
began
to
give
out
a
heat
that
blended
with
the
keenness
of
the
wind
it
may
have
been
this
strange
alternation
of
heat
and
cold
that
disturbed
the
tramp
in
his
dreams
for
he
struggled
tor
a
moment
with
the
snow
that
covered
him
like
a
man
who
finds
himself
twisted
uncomfortably
in
the
and
then
sat
up
with
staring
questioning
eyes
lord
i
thought
i
was
in
bed
he
said
to
himself
as
he
took
in
the
vacant
landscape
and
all
the
while
i
was
out
here
he
stretched
his
limbs
and
rising
carefully
to
his
feet
shook
the
snow
off
his
body
as
he
did
so
the
wind
set
him
shivering
and
he
knew
that
his
bed
had
been
warm
come
i
feel
pretty
fit
he
thought
i
suppose
i
am
lucky
to
wake
at
all
in
this
or
unlucky
it
is
much
of
a
business
to
come
back
to
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
downs
shining
against
the
blue
like
the
alps
on
a
that
means
another
forty
miles
or
so
i
suppose
he
continued
grimly
lord
knows
what
i
did
yesterday
walked
till
i
was
done
and
now
i
only
about
twelve
miles
from
brighton
damn
the
snow
damn
brighton
damn
everything
the
sun
crept
higher
and
higher
and
he
started
walking
patiently
along
the
road
with
his
back
turned
to
the
hills
am
i
glad
or
sorry
that
it
was
only
sleep
that
took
me
glad
or
sorry
glad
or
sorry
his
thoughts
seemed
to
arrange
themselves
in
a
metrical
accompaniment
to
the
steady
thud
of
his
footsteps
and
he
hardly
sought
an
answer
to
his
question
it
was
good
enough
to
walk
to
presently
when
three
milestones
had
loitered
past
he
overtook
a
boy
who
was
stooping
to
light
a
cigarette
he
wore
no
overcoat
and
looked
unspeakably
fragile
against
the
snow
are
you
on
the
road
asked
the
boy
huskily
as
he
passed
i
think
i
am
the
tramp
said
oh
then
i
come
a
bit
of
the
way
with
you
if
you
do
walk
too
fast
it
bit
lonesome
walking
this
time
of
day
the
tramp
nodded
his
head
and
the
boy
started
limping
along
by
his
side
i
eighteen
he
said
casually
i
bet
you
thought
i
was
younger
fifteen
i
have
said
you
have
backed
a
loser
eighteen
last
august
and
i
been
on
the
road
six
years
i
ran
away
from
home
five
times
when
i
was
a
little
and
the
police
took
me
back
each
time
very
good
to
me
the
police
was
now
i
have
got
a
home
to
run
away
from
nor
have
i
the
tramp
said
calmly
oh
i
can
see
what
you
are
the
boy
panted
you
a
gentleman
come
down
it
harder
for
you
than
for
me
the
tramp
glanced
at
the
limping
feeble
figure
and
lessened
his
pace
i
have
been
at
it
as
long
as
you
have
he
admitted
no
i
could
tell
that
by
the
way
you
walk
you
have
got
tired
yet
perhaps
you
expect
something
at
the
other
end
the
tramp
reflected
for
a
moment
i
do
know
he
said
bitterly
i
always
expecting
things
you
grow
out
of
that
the
boy
commented
it
warmer
in
london
but
it
harder
to
come
by
grub
there
is
much
in
it
really
still
there
the
chance
of
meeting
somebody
there
who
will
understand
country
people
are
better
the
boy
interrupted
last
night
i
took
a
lease
of
a
barn
for
nothing
and
slept
with
the
cows
and
this
morning
the
farmer
routed
me
out
and
gave
me
tea
and
toke
because
i
was
so
little
of
course
i
score
there
but
in
london
soup
on
the
embankment
at
night
and
all
the
rest
of
the
time
coppers
moving
you
on
i
dropped
by
the
roadside
last
night
and
slept
where
i
fell
it
a
wonder
i
did
die
the
tramp
said
the
boy
looked
at
him
sharply
how
did
you
know
you
did
he
said
i
do
see
it
the
tramp
said
after
a
pause
i
tell
you
the
boy
said
hoarsely
people
like
us
ca
get
away
from
this
sort
of
thing
if
we
want
to
always
hungry
and
thirsty
and
and
walking
all
the
while
and
yet
if
anyone
offers
me
a
nice
home
and
work
my
stomach
feels
sick
do
i
look
strong
i
know
i
little
for
my
age
but
i
been
knocking
about
like
this
for
six
years
and
do
you
think
i
not
dead
i
was
drowned
bathing
at
margate
and
i
was
killed
by
a
gypsy
with
a
spike
he
knocked
my
head
and
yet
i
walking
along
here
now
walking
to
london
to
walk
away
from
it
again
because
i
ca
help
it
dead
i
tell
you
we
ca
get
away
if
we
want
to
the
boy
broke
off
in
a
fit
of
coughing
and
the
tramp
paused
while
he
recovered
you
better
borrow
my
coat
for
a
bit
tommy
he
said
your
cough
pretty
bad
you
go
to
hell
the
boy
said
fiercely
puffing
at
his
cigarette
i
all
right
i
was
telling
you
about
the
road
you
have
got
down
to
it
yet
but
you
find
out
presently
we
all
dead
all
of
us
who
on
it
and
we
all
tired
yet
somehow
we
ca
leave
it
there
nice
smells
in
the
summer
dust
and
hay
and
the
wind
smack
in
your
face
on
a
hot
day
and
it
nice
waking
up
in
the
wet
grass
on
a
fine
morning
i
do
know
i
do
know
he
lurched
forward
suddenly
and
the
tramp
caught
him
in
his
arms
i
sick
the
boy
whispered
sick
the
tramp
looked
up
and
down
the
road
but
he
could
see
no
houses
or
any
sign
of
help
yet
even
as
he
supported
the
boy
doubtfully
in
the
middle
of
the
road
a
motor
car
suddenly
flashed
in
the
middle
distance
and
came
smoothly
through
the
snow
what
the
trouble
said
the
driver
quietly
as
he
pulled
up
i
a
doctor
he
looked
at
the
boy
keenly
and
listened
to
his
strained
breathing
pneumonia
he
commented
i
give
him
a
lift
to
the
infirmary
and
you
too
if
you
like
the
tramp
thought
of
the
workhouse
and
shook
his
head
i
rather
walk
he
said
the
boy
winked
faintly
as
they
lifted
him
into
the
car
i
meet
you
beyond
reigate
he
murmured
to
the
tramp
see
and
the
car
vanished
along
the
white
road
all
the
morning
the
tramp
splashed
through
the
thawing
snow
but
at
midday
he
begged
some
bread
at
a
cottage
door
and
crept
into
a
lonely
barn
to
eat
it
it
was
warm
in
there
and
after
his
meal
he
fell
asleep
among
the
hay
it
was
dark
when
he
woke
and
started
trudging
once
more
through
the
slushy
roads
two
miles
beyond
reigate
a
figure
a
fragile
figure
slipped
out
of
the
darkness
to
meet
him
on
the
road
said
a
husky
voice
then
i
come
a
bit
of
the
way
with
you
if
you
do
walk
too
fast
it
a
bit
lonesome
walking
this
time
of
day
but
the
pneumonia
cried
the
tramp
aghast
i
died
at
crawley
this
morning
said
the
boy
a
tragedy
in
little
i
jack
the
postmaster
little
son
stood
in
the
of
the
parlour
and
watched
his
mother
watering
the
nasturtiums
in
the
front
garden
a
certain
intensity
of
purpose
was
expressed
by
the
manner
in
which
she
handled
the
for
though
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
the
carrier
man
had
called
over
the
hedge
to
say
that
there
would
be
a
thunderstorm
during
the
night
and
every
one
knew
that
he
never
made
a
mistake
about
the
weather
nevertheless
jack
mother
watered
the
plants
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
meteorological
gift
smacked
a
little
of
sorcery
and
black
magic
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
felt
sure
that
there
would
be
a
thunderstorm
and
that
her
labour
was
therefore
vain
save
perhaps
as
a
protest
against
idle
superstition
it
was
in
the
same
spirit
that
she
carried
an
umbrella
on
the
brightest
summer
day
jack
had
been
sent
indoors
because
he
would
get
his
legs
in
the
way
of
the
in
order
to
cool
them
so
now
he
had
to
be
content
to
look
on
with
his
nose
pressed
so
tightly
against
the
pane
that
from
outside
it
looked
like
the
base
of
a
growing
in
a
glass
tank
he
could
no
longer
hear
the
glad
chuckle
of
the
when
the
water
ran
out
but
on
the
other
hand
he
could
write
his
name
on
the
window
with
his
tongue
which
he
could
not
have
done
if
he
had
been
in
the
garden
also
he
had
some
sweets
in
his
pocket
bought
with
a
halfpenny
stolen
from
his
own
and
as
the
window
did
not
taste
very
nice
he
slipped
one
into
his
mouth
and
sucked
it
with
enjoyment
he
did
not
like
being
in
the
parlour
because
he
had
to
sit
there
with
his
best
clothes
on
every
sunday
afternoon
and
read
the
parish
magazine
to
his
sleepy
parents
but
the
front
window
was
lovely
like
a
picture
and
indeed
he
thought
that
his
mother
with
the
flowers
all
about
her
and
the
red
sky
overhead
was
like
a
lady
on
one
of
the
beautiful
calendars
that
the
grocer
gave
away
at
christmas
he
finished
his
sweet
and
started
another
he
always
meant
to
suck
them
right
through
to
make
them
last
longer
but
when
the
sweet
was
half
finished
he
invariably
crunched
it
up
his
father
had
done
the
same
thing
as
a
boy
the
room
behind
him
was
getting
dark
but
outside
the
sky
seemed
to
be
growing
lighter
and
mother
still
stooped
from
bed
to
bed
moving
placidly
like
a
cow
sometimes
she
put
the
down
on
the
gravel
path
and
bent
to
uproot
a
microscopic
weed
or
to
pull
the
head
off
a
dead
flower
sometimes
she
went
to
the
well
to
get
some
more
water
and
then
jack
was
sorry
that
he
had
been
shut
indoors
for
he
liked
letting
the
pail
down
with
a
run
and
hearing
it
bump
against
the
brick
sides
once
he
tapped
upon
the
window
for
permission
to
come
out
but
mother
shook
her
head
vigorously
without
turning
round
and
yet
his
stockings
were
hardly
wet
at
all
suddenly
mother
straightened
herself
and
jack
looked
up
and
saw
his
father
leaning
over
the
gate
he
seemed
to
be
making
grimaces
and
jack
made
haste
to
laugh
aloud
in
the
empty
room
because
he
knew
that
he
was
good
at
seeing
his
father
jokes
indeed
it
was
a
funny
thing
that
father
should
come
home
early
from
work
and
make
faces
at
mother
from
the
road
mother
too
was
willing
to
join
in
the
fun
for
she
knelt
down
among
the
wet
flowers
and
as
her
head
drooped
lower
and
lower
it
looked
for
one
ecstatic
moment
as
though
she
were
going
to
turn
head
over
heels
but
she
lay
quite
still
on
the
ground
and
father
came
through
the
gate
and
then
turned
and
ran
off
down
the
hill
towards
the
station
jack
stood
in
the
window
clapping
his
hands
and
laughing
it
was
a
strange
game
but
not
much
harder
to
understand
than
most
of
the
amusements
of
the
people
and
then
as
nothing
happened
as
mother
did
not
move
and
father
did
not
come
back
jack
grew
frightened
the
garden
was
queer
and
the
room
was
full
of
darkness
so
he
beat
on
the
window
to
change
the
game
then
since
mother
did
not
shake
her
head
he
ran
out
into
the
garden
smiling
carefully
in
case
he
was
being
silly
first
he
went
to
the
gate
but
father
was
quite
small
far
down
the
road
so
he
turned
back
and
pulled
the
sleeve
of
his
mother
dress
to
wake
her
after
a
dreadful
while
mother
got
up
off
the
ground
with
her
skirt
all
covered
with
wet
earth
jack
tried
to
brush
it
off
with
his
hands
and
made
a
mess
of
it
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
looking
across
the
garden
with
such
a
desolate
face
that
when
he
saw
it
he
burst
into
tears
for
once
mother
let
him
cry
himself
out
without
seeking
to
comfort
him
when
he
sniffed
dolefully
his
nostrils
were
full
of
the
scent
of
crushed
marigolds
he
could
not
help
watching
her
hands
through
his
tears
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
playing
together
at
they
were
not
still
for
a
moment
but
it
was
her
face
that
at
once
frightened
and
interested
him
one
minute
it
looked
smooth
and
white
as
if
she
was
very
cross
and
the
next
minute
it
was
gathered
up
in
little
folds
as
if
she
was
going
to
sneeze
deep
down
in
him
something
chuckled
and
he
jumped
for
fear
that
the
cross
part
of
her
had
heard
it
at
intervals
during
the
evening
while
mother
was
getting
him
his
supper
this
chuckle
returned
to
him
between
unnoticed
fits
of
crying
once
she
stood
holding
a
plate
in
the
middle
of
the
room
for
quite
five
minutes
and
he
found
it
hard
to
control
his
mirth
if
father
had
been
there
they
would
have
had
good
fun
together
teasing
mother
but
by
himself
he
was
not
sure
of
his
ground
and
father
did
not
come
back
and
mother
did
not
seem
to
hear
his
questions
he
had
some
tomatoes
and
for
his
supper
and
as
mother
left
him
to
help
himself
to
brown
sugar
he
enjoyed
it
very
much
carefully
leaving
the
skin
of
the
to
the
last
because
that
was
the
part
he
liked
best
after
supper
he
sat
nodding
at
the
open
window
looking
out
over
the
to
the
sky
beyond
where
the
black
clouds
were
putting
out
the
stars
one
by
one
the
garden
smelt
stuffy
but
it
was
nice
to
be
allowed
to
sit
up
when
you
felt
really
sleepy
on
the
whole
he
felt
that
it
had
been
a
pleasant
exciting
sort
of
day
though
once
or
twice
mother
had
frightened
him
by
looking
so
strange
there
had
been
other
mysterious
days
in
his
life
however
perhaps
he
was
going
to
have
another
little
dead
sister
presently
he
discovered
that
it
was
delightful
to
shut
your
eyes
and
nod
your
head
and
pretend
that
you
were
going
to
sleep
it
was
like
being
in
a
swing
that
went
up
and
up
and
never
came
down
again
it
was
like
being
in
a
on
the
river
after
a
steamer
had
gone
by
it
was
like
lying
in
a
cradle
under
a
lamplit
ceiling
a
cradle
that
rocked
gently
to
and
fro
while
mother
sang
songs
he
was
still
a
baby
when
he
woke
up
and
he
slipped
off
his
chair
and
staggered
blindly
across
the
room
to
his
mother
with
his
knuckles
in
his
eyes
like
a
little
little
boy
he
climbed
into
her
lap
and
settled
himself
down
with
a
grunt
of
contentment
there
was
a
mutter
of
thunder
in
his
ears
and
he
felt
great
warm
drops
of
rain
falling
on
his
face
and
into
his
dreams
he
carried
the
dim
consciousness
that
the
thunderstorm
had
begun
ii
the
next
morning
at
father
had
not
come
back
and
mother
said
a
lot
of
things
that
made
jack
feel
very
uncomfortable
she
herself
had
taught
him
that
any
one
who
said
bad
things
about
his
father
was
wicked
but
now
it
seemed
that
she
was
trying
to
tell
him
something
about
father
that
was
not
nice
she
spoke
so
slowly
that
he
hardly
understood
a
word
she
said
though
he
gathered
that
father
had
stolen
something
and
would
be
put
in
prison
if
he
was
caught
with
a
guilty
pang
he
remembered
his
own
dealings
with
his
and
he
determined
to
throw
away
the
rest
of
the
sweets
when
nobody
was
looking
then
mother
made
the
astounding
statement
that
he
was
not
to
go
to
school
that
day
but
his
sudden
joy
was
checked
a
little
when
she
said
he
was
not
to
go
out
at
all
except
into
the
back
garden
it
seemed
to
jack
that
he
must
be
ill
but
when
he
made
this
suggestion
to
mother
she
gave
up
her
explanations
with
a
sigh
afterwards
she
kept
on
saying
aloud
i
must
think
i
must
think
she
said
it
so
often
that
jack
started
keeping
count
on
his
fingers
the
day
went
slowly
enough
for
the
garden
was
wet
after
the
thunderstorm
and
mother
would
not
play
any
games
just
before
two
gentlemen
called
and
talked
to
mother
in
the
parlour
and
after
a
while
they
sent
for
jack
to
answer
some
questions
about
father
though
mother
was
there
all
the
time
they
seemed
nice
gentlemen
but
mother
did
not
ask
them
to
stop
to
tea
as
jack
expected
he
thought
that
perhaps
she
was
sorry
that
she
had
not
done
so
for
she
was
very
sad
all
and
let
him
spread
his
own
bread
and
jam
when
tea
was
over
things
were
very
dull
and
at
last
jack
started
crying
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
presently
he
heard
a
little
noise
and
found
that
mother
was
crying
as
well
this
seemed
to
him
so
extraordinary
that
he
stopped
crying
to
watch
her
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
very
quickly
and
she
kept
on
wiping
them
away
with
her
handkerchief
but
if
she
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
perhaps
they
would
not
be
able
to
come
out
at
all
it
occurred
to
him
that
possibly
she
was
sorry
she
had
said
wicked
things
about
father
and
to
comfort
her
for
it
made
him
feel
fidgety
to
see
her
cry
he
whispered
to
her
that
he
would
not
tell
but
she
stared
at
him
hopelessly
through
her
red
eyelids
and
he
felt
that
he
had
not
said
the
right
thing
she
called
him
her
poor
boy
and
yet
it
appeared
that
he
was
not
ill
it
was
all
very
mysterious
and
uncomfortable
and
it
would
be
a
good
thing
when
father
came
back
and
everything
went
on
as
before
even
though
he
had
to
go
back
to
school
later
on
the
woman
from
the
mill
came
in
to
sit
with
mother
she
brought
jack
some
sweets
but
instead
of
playing
with
him
she
burst
into
tears
she
made
more
noise
when
she
cried
than
mother
in
fact
he
was
afraid
that
in
a
minute
he
would
have
to
laugh
at
her
snortings
so
he
went
into
the
parlour
and
sat
there
in
the
dark
eating
his
sweets
and
knitting
his
brow
over
the
complexities
of
life
he
could
see
five
stars
and
there
was
a
light
behind
the
red
curtain
of
the
front
bedroom
at
arber
farm
it
was
about
twelve
times
as
large
as
a
star
and
a
much
prettier
colour
by
nearly
closing
his
eyes
he
could
see
everything
double
so
that
there
were
ten
stars
and
two
red
lights
he
was
trying
to
make
everything
come
treble
when
the
gate
clicked
and
he
saw
his
father
shadow
he
was
delighted
with
this
happy
end
to
a
tiresome
day
and
as
he
ran
through
the
passage
he
called
out
to
mother
to
say
that
father
was
back
mother
did
not
answer
but
he
heard
a
bit
of
noise
in
the
kitchen
as
he
opened
the
front
door
he
said
good
evening
in
the
voice
that
father
encouraged
but
father
slipped
in
and
shut
the
door
without
saying
a
word
every
night
when
he
came
back
from
the
he
brought
jack
the
gummed
edgings
off
the
sheets
of
stamps
and
jack
held
out
his
hand
for
them
as
a
matter
of
course
automatically
father
felt
in
his
overcoat
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
great
handful
take
care
of
them
they
the
last
you
get
he
said
but
when
jack
asked
why
his
father
looked
at
him
with
the
same
hopeless
expression
that
he
had
found
in
his
mother
eyes
a
short
while
before
jack
felt
a
little
cross
that
every
one
should
be
so
stupid
when
they
went
into
the
kitchen
everybody
looked
very
strange
and
jack
sat
down
in
the
corner
and
listened
for
an
explanation
as
a
rule
the
conversation
of
the
people
did
not
amuse
him
but
tonight
he
felt
that
something
had
happened
and
that
if
he
kept
quiet
he
might
find
out
what
it
was
he
had
noticed
before
that
when
the
talked
they
always
said
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
and
now
they
were
worse
than
usual
father
said
it
no
good
i
got
to
go
through
it
the
said
whatever
made
you
do
it
george
and
mother
said
nothing
will
ever
happen
to
me
again
they
all
went
on
saying
these
things
till
jack
grew
tired
of
listening
and
started
plaiting
his
into
a
mat
if
you
did
it
very
neatly
it
was
almost
as
good
as
an
ordinary
sheet
of
paper
by
the
time
you
had
finished
by
and
by
while
he
was
still
at
work
the
brought
him
his
supper
on
a
plate
and
raising
his
head
he
saw
that
father
and
mother
were
sitting
close
together
looking
at
each
other
and
saying
nothing
at
all
he
was
very
disappointed
that
although
father
had
come
home
they
had
not
had
any
jokes
all
the
evening
and
as
they
were
all
so
dull
he
did
not
very
much
mind
being
sent
to
bed
when
he
had
finished
his
supper
when
he
said
to
father
he
noticed
that
his
boots
were
very
muddy
as
if
he
had
walked
a
long
way
like
a
common
postman
he
made
a
joke
about
this
but
they
all
looked
at
him
as
if
he
had
said
something
wrong
so
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
glad
to
get
away
from
these
people
whose
looks
had
no
reasonable
significance
and
whose
words
had
no
discoverable
meaning
it
had
been
a
bad
day
and
he
hoped
mother
would
let
him
go
back
to
school
the
next
morning
and
yet
though
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
got
into
bed
the
day
was
not
quite
over
he
had
only
dozed
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
was
roused
by
a
noise
down
below
and
slipping
out
on
to
the
staircase
he
heard
the
saying
in
the
passage
when
she
had
gone
and
the
door
had
banged
behind
her
he
listened
still
and
heard
his
mother
crying
and
his
father
talking
on
and
on
in
a
strange
hoarse
voice
somehow
these
incomprehensible
sounds
made
him
feel
lonely
and
he
would
have
liked
to
have
gone
downstairs
and
sat
on
his
mother
lap
and
blinked
drowsily
in
his
father
face
as
he
had
done
often
enough
before
but
he
was
always
shy
in
the
presence
of
strangers
and
he
felt
that
he
did
not
know
this
woman
who
wept
and
this
man
who
did
not
laugh
his
father
was
his
the
sharer
of
all
his
fun
his
mother
was
a
quiet
woman
who
sat
and
sewed
and
sometimes
told
them
not
to
be
silly
which
was
the
best
joke
of
all
it
was
not
right
for
people
to
alter
but
the
thought
of
his
bedroom
made
him
desolate
and
at
last
he
plucked
up
his
courage
and
crept
downstairs
on
bare
feet
father
and
mother
had
gone
back
into
the
kitchen
and
he
peeped
through
the
crack
of
the
door
to
see
what
they
were
doing
mother
was
still
crying
always
crying
but
he
had
to
change
his
position
before
he
could
see
father
then
he
turned
on
his
heels
and
ran
upstairs
trembling
with
fear
and
disgust
for
father
the
man
of
all
the
jokes
the
man
of
whom
burglars
were
afraid
and
compared
with
whom
all
other
little
boys
fathers
were
as
dirt
was
crying
like
a
little
girl
he
jumped
into
bed
and
pulled
the
bedclothes
over
his
face
to
shut
out
the
ugliness
of
the
world
iii
when
jack
woke
up
the
next
morning
he
found
that
the
room
was
full
of
sunshine
and
that
father
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
bed
the
moment
jack
opened
his
eyes
he
began
telling
him
something
in
a
serious
voice
which
was
alone
sufficient
to
prevent
jack
from
understanding
what
he
said
besides
he
used
a
lot
of
long
words
and
jack
thought
that
it
was
silly
to
use
long
words
before
breakfast
when
nobody
could
be
expected
to
remember
what
they
meant
body
neatly
fitted
the
square
of
the
window
and
the
sunbeams
shone
in
all
round
it
and
made
it
look
splendid
and
if
jack
had
not
already
forgotten
the
unfortunate
impression
of
the
night
before
this
would
have
enabled
him
to
overcome
it
every
now
and
then
father
stopped
to
ask
him
if
he
understood
and
he
said
he
did
hoping
to
find
out
what
it
was
all
about
later
on
it
seemed
however
that
father
was
not
going
to
the
any
more
and
this
caused
jack
to
picture
a
series
of
delightfully
amusing
days
when
father
had
finished
talking
he
appeared
to
expect
jack
to
say
something
but
jack
contented
himself
with
trying
to
look
interested
for
he
knew
that
it
was
always
very
stupid
of
little
boys
not
to
understand
things
they
did
understand
in
reality
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
listening
while
his
father
argued
aloud
with
himself
talking
up
and
down
like
an
earthquake
map
at
breakfast
they
were
still
subdued
but
afterwards
as
the
morning
wore
on
father
became
livelier
and
helped
jack
to
build
a
hut
in
the
back
garden
they
built
it
of
against
the
wall
at
the
end
and
father
broke
up
a
to
get
planks
for
the
roof
only
mother
still
had
a
sad
face
and
it
made
jack
angry
with
her
that
she
should
be
such
a
after
dinner
while
jack
was
playing
in
the
hut
simmons
of
the
and
another
gentleman
called
to
take
father
for
a
walk
and
jack
went
down
to
the
front
to
see
them
off
jack
knew
simmons
very
well
he
had
been
to
tea
with
his
little
boy
but
though
he
thought
him
a
fine
sort
of
man
he
could
not
help
feeling
proud
of
his
father
when
he
saw
them
side
by
side
simmons
looked
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
himself
while
father
walked
along
with
square
shoulders
and
a
high
head
as
if
he
had
just
done
something
splendid
the
other
gentleman
looked
like
nothing
at
all
beside
father
when
they
were
out
of
sight
jack
went
into
the
house
and
found
mother
crying
in
the
kitchen
as
he
felt
more
tolerant
in
his
mood
he
tried
to
cheer
her
up
by
telling
her
how
fine
father
had
looked
beside
the
other
two
men
mother
raised
her
face
all
swollen
and
spoilt
with
weeping
and
gazed
at
her
son
in
astonishment
they
are
taking
him
to
prison
she
wailed
and
god
knows
what
will
become
of
us
for
a
moment
jack
felt
alarmed
then
a
thought
came
to
him
and
he
smiled
like
a
little
boy
who
has
just
found
a
new
and
delightful
game
never
mind
mother
he
said
we
help
him
to
escape
but
mother
would
not
stop
crying
shepherd
boy
the
path
climbed
up
and
up
and
threatened
to
carry
me
over
the
highest
point
of
the
downs
till
it
faltered
before
a
sudden
outcrop
of
chalk
and
swerved
round
the
hill
on
the
level
i
was
grateful
for
the
respite
for
i
had
been
walking
all
day
and
my
knapsack
was
growing
heavy
above
me
in
the
blue
pastures
of
the
skies
the
were
grazing
with
the
sun
on
their
snowy
backs
and
all
about
me
the
grey
sheep
of
earth
were
cropping
the
wild
pansies
that
grew
wherever
the
chalk
had
won
a
covering
of
soil
presently
i
came
upon
the
shepherd
standing
erect
by
the
path
a
tall
spare
man
with
a
face
that
the
sun
and
the
wind
had
robbed
of
all
expression
the
dog
at
his
feet
looked
more
intelligent
than
he
you
come
up
from
the
valley
he
said
as
i
passed
perhaps
you
have
seen
my
boy
i
sorry
i
have
i
said
pausing
sorrow
breaks
no
bones
he
muttered
and
strode
away
with
his
dog
at
his
heels
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
dog
was
apologetic
for
his
master
rudeness
i
walked
on
to
the
little
village
where
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
pass
the
night
the
man
at
the
village
shop
said
he
would
put
me
up
so
i
took
off
my
knapsack
and
sat
down
on
a
sackful
of
cattle
cake
while
the
bacon
was
cooking
if
you
came
over
the
hill
you
have
met
shepherd
said
the
man
and
he
have
asked
you
for
his
boy
yes
but
i
had
seen
him
the
shopman
nodded
there
are
clever
folk
who
say
you
can
see
him
and
clever
folk
who
say
you
ca
the
simple
ones
like
you
and
me
we
say
nothing
but
we
do
see
him
shepherd
has
got
no
boy
what
is
it
a
joke
well
of
course
it
may
be
said
the
guardedly
though
i
ca
say
i
heard
many
people
laughing
at
it
yet
you
see
shepherd
boy
he
broke
his
that
was
in
the
days
before
they
built
the
fence
above
the
big
that
you
passed
on
your
left
coming
down
a
dangerous
place
it
used
to
be
for
the
sheep
so
shepherd
boy
he
used
to
lie
along
there
to
stop
them
dropping
into
it
while
shepherd
dog
he
stopped
them
from
going
too
far
and
shepherd
he
used
to
come
down
here
and
have
his
glass
for
he
took
it
then
like
you
or
me
blue
ribbon
now
it
was
one
night
when
the
mists
were
out
on
the
hills
and
maybe
shepherd
had
had
a
glass
too
much
or
maybe
he
got
a
bit
lost
in
the
smoke
but
when
he
went
up
there
to
bring
them
home
he
starts
driving
them
into
the
pit
as
straight
as
could
be
shepherd
boy
he
hollered
out
and
ran
to
stop
them
but
of
them
went
over
and
the
lad
he
went
with
them
you
may
believe
me
but
five
of
them
were
so
much
as
scratched
though
it
a
sixty
feet
drop
likely
they
fell
soft
on
top
of
the
others
but
shepherd
boy
he
was
done
shepherd
he
a
bit
spotty
now
and
most
times
he
thinks
the
still
with
him
and
there
are
clever
folk
who
tell
you
that
they
seen
the
boy
helping
shepherd
dog
with
the
sheep
that
would
be
a
ghost
now
i
should
wonder
i
never
seen
it
but
then
i
simple
as
you
might
say
but
i
had
two
boys
myself
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
boy
like
that
who
did
eat
and
did
get
into
mischief
and
did
his
work
would
be
the
handiest
kind
of
boy
to
have
about
the
place
the
passing
of
edward
i
found
dorothy
sitting
sedately
on
the
beach
with
a
mass
of
black
seaweed
twined
in
her
hands
and
her
bare
feet
sparkling
white
in
the
sun
even
in
the
first
glow
of
recognition
i
realised
that
she
was
paler
than
she
had
been
the
summer
before
and
yet
i
can
not
blame
myself
for
the
tactlessness
of
my
question
where
edward
i
said
and
i
looked
about
the
sands
for
a
sailor
suit
and
a
little
pair
of
prancing
legs
while
i
looked
dorothy
eyes
watched
mine
inquiringly
as
if
she
wondered
what
i
might
see
edward
dead
she
said
simply
he
died
last
year
after
you
left
for
a
moment
i
could
only
gaze
at
the
child
in
silence
and
ask
myself
what
reason
there
was
in
the
thing
that
had
hurt
her
so
now
that
i
knew
that
edward
played
with
her
no
more
i
could
see
that
there
was
a
shadow
upon
her
face
too
dark
for
her
years
and
that
she
had
lost
to
some
extent
that
exquisite
carelessness
of
poise
which
makes
children
so
young
her
voice
was
so
calm
that
i
might
have
thought
her
forgetful
had
i
not
seen
an
instant
of
patent
pain
in
her
wide
eyes
i
sorry
i
said
at
length
very
very
sorry
indeed
i
had
brought
down
my
car
to
take
you
for
a
drive
as
i
promised
oh
edward
have
liked
that
she
answered
thoughtfully
he
was
so
fond
of
motors
she
swung
round
suddenly
and
looked
at
the
sands
behind
her
with
staring
eyes
i
thought
i
heard
she
broke
off
in
confusion
i
too
had
believed
for
an
instant
that
i
had
heard
something
that
was
not
the
wind
or
the
distant
children
or
the
smooth
sea
hissing
along
the
beach
during
that
golden
summer
which
linked
me
with
the
dead
edward
had
been
wont
in
moments
of
elation
to
puff
up
and
down
the
sands
in
artistic
representation
of
a
nobby
noisy
but
the
dead
may
play
no
more
and
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
sands
and
the
hot
sky
and
dorothy
you
had
better
let
me
take
you
for
a
run
dorothy
i
said
the
man
will
drive
and
we
can
talk
as
we
go
along
she
nodded
gravely
and
began
pulling
on
her
sandy
stockings
it
did
not
hurt
him
she
said
inconsequently
the
restraint
in
her
voice
pained
me
like
a
blow
oh
do
dear
do
i
cried
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
forget
i
have
forgotten
quite
she
answered
pulling
at
her
with
calm
fingers
it
was
ten
months
ago
we
walked
up
to
the
front
where
the
car
was
waiting
and
dorothy
settled
herself
among
the
cushions
with
a
little
sigh
of
contentment
the
human
quality
of
which
brought
me
a
certain
relief
if
only
she
would
laugh
or
cry
i
sat
down
by
her
side
but
the
man
waited
by
the
open
door
what
is
it
i
asked
i
sorry
sir
he
answered
looking
about
him
in
confusion
i
thought
i
saw
a
young
gentleman
with
you
he
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
and
in
a
minute
we
were
running
through
the
town
i
knew
that
dorothy
was
watching
my
face
with
her
wounded
eyes
but
i
did
not
look
at
her
until
the
green
fields
leapt
up
on
either
side
of
the
white
road
it
is
only
for
a
little
while
that
we
may
not
see
him
i
said
all
this
is
nothing
i
have
forgotten
she
repeated
i
think
this
is
a
very
nice
motor
i
had
not
previously
complained
of
the
motor
but
i
was
wishing
then
that
it
would
cease
its
poignant
imitation
of
a
little
dead
boy
a
boy
who
would
play
no
more
by
the
touch
of
dorothy
sleeve
against
mine
i
knew
that
she
could
hear
it
too
and
the
miles
flew
by
green
and
brown
and
golden
while
i
wondered
what
use
i
might
be
in
the
world
who
could
not
help
a
child
to
forget
possibly
there
was
another
way
i
thought
tell
me
how
it
happened
i
said
dorothy
looked
at
me
with
inscrutable
eyes
and
spoke
in
a
voice
without
emotion
he
caught
a
cold
and
was
very
ill
in
bed
i
went
in
to
see
him
and
he
was
all
white
and
faded
i
said
to
him
are
you
edward
and
he
said
shall
get
up
early
in
the
morning
to
catch
beetles
i
did
see
him
any
more
poor
little
chap
i
murmured
i
went
to
the
funeral
she
continued
monotonously
it
was
very
rainy
and
i
threw
a
little
bunch
of
flowers
down
into
the
hole
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
flowers
there
but
i
think
edward
liked
apples
better
than
flowers
did
you
cry
i
said
cruelly
she
paused
i
do
know
i
suppose
so
it
was
a
long
time
ago
i
think
i
have
forgotten
even
while
she
spoke
i
heard
edward
puffing
along
the
sands
edward
who
had
been
so
fond
of
apples
i
can
not
stand
this
any
longer
i
said
aloud
let
get
out
and
walk
in
the
woods
for
a
change
she
agreed
with
a
depth
of
comprehension
that
terrified
me
and
the
motor
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
at
a
spot
where
hardly
a
post
served
to
mark
where
the
woods
commenced
and
the
wayside
grass
stopped
we
took
one
of
the
dim
paths
which
the
rabbits
had
made
and
forced
our
way
through
the
undergrowth
into
the
peaceful
twilight
of
the
trees
you
have
got
very
sunburnt
this
year
i
said
as
we
walked
i
do
know
why
i
been
out
on
the
beach
all
the
days
sometimes
i
played
too
i
did
not
ask
her
what
games
she
had
played
or
who
had
been
her
yet
even
there
in
the
quiet
woods
i
knew
that
edward
was
holding
her
back
from
me
it
is
true
that
in
his
boy
way
he
had
been
fond
of
me
but
i
should
not
have
dared
to
take
her
out
without
him
in
the
days
when
his
live
lips
had
filled
the
beach
with
song
and
his
small
brown
body
had
danced
among
the
surf
now
it
seemed
that
i
had
been
disloyal
to
him
and
presently
we
came
to
a
clearing
where
the
leaves
of
forgotten
years
lay
brown
and
rotten
beneath
our
feet
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
dryness
of
death
let
be
going
back
what
do
you
think
dorothy
i
said
i
think
she
said
slowly
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
very
good
place
to
catch
beetles
a
wood
is
full
of
secret
noises
and
that
is
why
i
suppose
we
heard
a
pair
of
small
quick
feet
come
with
a
dance
of
triumph
through
the
rustling
bracken
for
a
minute
we
listened
deeply
and
then
dorothy
broke
from
my
side
with
a
piercing
call
on
her
lips
oh
edward
edward
she
cried
edward
but
the
dead
may
play
no
more
and
presently
she
came
back
to
me
with
the
tears
that
are
the
riches
of
childhood
streaming
down
her
face
i
can
hear
him
i
can
hear
him
she
sobbed
but
i
can
not
see
him
never
never
again
and
so
i
led
her
back
to
the
motor
but
in
her
tears
i
seemed
to
find
a
promise
of
peace
that
she
had
not
known
before
now
edward
was
no
very
wonderful
little
boy
it
may
be
that
he
was
jealous
and
vain
and
greedy
yet
now
it
seemed
as
he
lay
in
his
small
grave
with
the
memory
of
dorothy
flowers
about
him
he
had
wrought
this
kindness
for
his
sister
yes
even
though
we
heard
no
more
than
the
birds
in
the
branches
and
the
wind
swaying
the
scented
bracken
even
though
he
had
passed
with
another
summer
and
the
dead
and
the
love
of
the
dead
may
rise
no
more
from
the
grave
the
story
of
a
book
i
the
writer
the
history
of
a
book
must
necessarily
begin
with
the
history
of
its
author
for
surely
in
these
enlightened
days
neither
the
youngest
nor
the
oldest
of
critics
can
believe
that
works
of
art
are
found
under
or
in
the
nests
of
storks
in
truth
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
everybody
knew
this
before
the
publication
of
the
man
shakespeare
and
for
the
sake
of
a
mystified
posterity
it
may
be
well
to
explain
that
there
was
once
a
school
of
criticism
that
thought
it
indecent
to
pry
into
that
of
individuality
from
which
if
we
reject
the
nursery
hypotheses
mentioned
above
it
is
clearly
obvious
that
authors
derive
their
works
that
the
drama
must
needs
be
closely
related
to
the
dramatist
is
just
one
of
those
simple
discoveries
that
invariably
elude
the
subtle
professional
mind
but
in
this
wiser
hour
i
may
be
permitted
to
assume
that
the
author
was
the
conscious
father
of
his
novel
and
that
he
did
not
find
it
surprisingly
in
his
pocket
one
morning
like
a
bad
shilling
taken
in
change
from
the
cabman
overnight
before
he
published
his
novel
at
the
ripe
age
of
the
author
had
lived
an
irreproachable
and
gentlemanly
life
born
with
at
least
a
spoon
in
his
mouth
he
passed
after
a
normally
eventful
childhood
through
a
respectable
public
school
and
spent
several
agreeable
years
at
cambridge
without
taking
a
degree
he
then
went
into
his
uncle
office
in
the
city
where
he
idled
daily
from
ten
to
four
till
in
due
course
he
was
admitted
to
a
partnership
which
enabled
him
to
reduce
his
hours
of
idleness
to
eleven
to
three
these
details
become
important
when
we
reflect
that
from
his
childhood
on
the
author
had
a
great
deal
of
time
at
his
disposal
if
he
had
been
entirely
normal
he
would
have
accepted
the
conventions
of
the
society
to
which
he
belonged
and
devoted
himself
to
motoring
bridge
and
the
encouragement
of
the
lighter
drama
but
some
habit
of
his
childhood
or
even
perhaps
some
remote
hereditary
taint
led
him
to
spend
an
appreciable
fraction
of
his
leisure
time
in
the
reading
of
works
of
fiction
unlike
most
lovers
of
light
literature
he
read
with
a
certain
mental
concentration
and
was
enough
to
read
good
novels
as
well
as
bad
ones
it
is
a
pleasant
fact
that
it
is
impossible
to
concentrate
one
mind
on
anything
without
in
time
becoming
wiser
and
in
the
course
of
years
the
author
became
quite
a
skilful
critic
of
novels
from
the
first
he
had
allowed
his
reading
to
colour
his
impressions
of
life
and
had
obediently
lived
in
a
world
of
blacks
and
whites
of
heroes
and
heroines
of
villains
and
adventuresses
until
the
grateful
discovery
of
the
realistic
school
of
fiction
permitted
him
to
believe
that
men
and
women
were
for
the
most
part
neither
good
nor
bad
but
tabby
moreover
the
leisurely
reading
of
many
sentences
had
given
him
some
understanding
of
the
elements
of
style
he
perceived
that
some
combinations
of
words
were
illogical
and
that
others
were
unlovely
to
the
ear
and
at
the
same
time
he
acquired
a
vocabulary
and
a
knowledge
of
grammar
and
punctuation
that
his
earlier
education
had
failed
to
give
him
he
read
new
novels
at
his
and
took
pleasure
in
correcting
the
mistakes
of
their
authors
in
ink
when
he
had
done
this
he
would
hand
them
to
his
wife
who
always
read
the
end
first
and
indeed
rarely
pursued
her
investigation
of
a
book
beyond
the
last
chapter
we
buy
knowledge
with
illusions
and
pay
a
high
price
for
it
for
the
acquirement
of
quite
a
small
degree
of
wisdom
will
deprive
us
of
a
large
number
of
pleasant
fancies
so
it
was
with
the
author
who
found
his
joy
in
diminishing
rapidly
as
his
critical
knowledge
increased
he
was
no
longer
able
to
lose
himself
between
the
covers
of
a
romance
but
slid
his
between
the
pages
of
a
book
with
an
unwholesome
readiness
to
be
irritated
by
the
ignorance
and
folly
of
the
novelist
his
destructive
criticism
of
works
of
fiction
became
so
acute
that
it
was
natural
that
his
unlettered
friends
should
suggest
that
he
himself
ought
to
write
a
novel
for
a
long
while
he
was
content
to
receive
the
flattering
suggestion
with
a
reticent
smile
that
masked
his
conviction
that
there
was
a
difference
between
criticism
and
creation
but
as
he
grew
older
the
imperfections
in
the
books
he
read
ceased
to
give
him
the
thrill
of
the
successful
explorer
in
sight
of
the
expected
and
time
began
to
trickle
too
slowly
through
his
idle
fingers
one
day
he
sat
down
and
wrote
chapter
i
at
the
head
of
a
sheet
of
quarto
paper
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
difficulty
was
only
one
of
selection
and
he
wrote
of
a
novel
with
a
breathless
ease
of
creation
that
made
him
marvel
at
himself
and
the
pitiful
struggles
of
less
gifted
novelists
then
in
a
moment
of
insight
he
picked
up
his
manuscript
and
realised
that
what
he
had
written
was
childishly
crude
he
had
felt
his
story
while
he
wrote
it
but
somehow
or
other
he
had
failed
to
get
his
emotions
on
paper
and
he
saw
quite
clearly
that
it
was
worse
and
not
better
than
the
majority
of
the
books
which
he
had
held
up
to
ridicule
there
was
a
certain
doggedness
in
his
character
that
might
have
made
him
a
useful
citizen
but
for
that
unfortunate
hereditary
spoon
and
he
wrote
chapter
i
at
the
head
of
a
new
sheet
of
quarto
paper
long
before
the
library
fire
had
reached
the
heart
of
his
first
luckless
manuscript
this
time
he
wrote
more
slowly
and
with
a
waning
confidence
that
failed
him
altogether
when
he
was
about
through
reading
the
fragment
dispassionately
he
thought
there
were
good
pages
in
it
but
taken
as
a
whole
it
was
unequal
and
moved
forward
only
by
fits
and
starts
he
began
again
with
his
late
manuscript
spread
about
him
on
the
table
for
reference
at
the
fifth
attempt
he
succeeded
in
writing
a
whole
novel
in
the
course
of
his
struggles
he
had
acquired
a
philosophy
of
composition
especially
he
had
learned
to
shun
those
enchanted
hours
when
the
labour
of
creation
became
suspiciously
easy
for
he
had
found
by
experience
that
the
work
he
did
in
these
moments
of
inspiration
was
either
bad
in
itself
or
out
of
key
with
the
preceding
chapters
he
thought
that
inspiration
might
be
useful
to
poets
or
writers
of
short
stories
but
personally
as
a
novelist
he
found
it
a
nuisance
by
dint
of
hard
work
however
he
succeeded
in
eliminating
its
evil
influence
from
his
final
draft
he
told
himself
that
he
had
no
illusions
as
to
the
merits
of
his
book
he
knew
he
was
not
a
man
of
genius
but
he
knew
also
that
the
grammar
and
the
punctuation
of
his
novel
were
far
above
the
average
of
such
works
and
although
he
could
not
read
sir
thomas
browne
or
walter
pater
with
pleasure
he
felt
sure
that
his
book
was
written
in
a
straightforward
and
gentlemanly
style
he
was
prepared
to
be
told
that
his
use
of
the
colon
was
audacious
and
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
an
agreeable
controversy
on
the
question
he
read
his
book
to
his
friends
who
made
suggestions
that
would
have
involved
its
rewriting
from
one
end
to
the
other
he
read
it
to
his
enemies
who
told
him
that
it
was
nearly
good
enough
to
publish
he
read
it
to
his
wife
who
said
that
it
was
very
nice
and
that
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
no
one
seemed
to
realise
that
it
was
the
most
important
thing
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
this
quickened
his
eagerness
to
get
it
published
an
eagerness
only
tempered
by
a
very
real
fear
of
those
knowing
dogs
the
critics
he
could
not
forget
that
he
had
criticised
a
good
many
books
himself
in
terms
that
would
have
made
the
authors
abandon
their
profession
if
they
had
but
heard
his
strictures
and
he
had
read
notices
in
the
papers
that
would
have
made
him
droop
with
shame
if
they
had
referred
to
any
work
of
his
when
these
sombre
thoughts
came
to
him
he
would
pick
up
his
book
and
read
it
again
and
in
common
fairness
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
found
it
uncommonly
good
one
day
after
a
whole
batch
of
ungrammatical
novels
had
reached
him
from
the
library
he
posted
his
manuscript
to
his
favourite
publisher
he
had
heard
stories
of
masterpieces
many
times
rejected
so
he
did
not
tell
his
wife
what
he
had
done
ii
the
sleepy
publisher
the
publisher
to
whom
our
author
had
confided
his
manuscript
stood
like
all
publishers
at
the
very
head
of
his
profession
his
business
was
conducted
on
sound
conservative
lines
which
means
that
though
he
had
regretfully
abandoned
the
novel
for
the
novel
published
at
six
shillings
he
was
not
among
the
intrepid
revolutionaries
who
were
beginning
to
produce
new
fiction
at
a
still
lower
price
besides
novels
he
published
solid
works
of
biography
at
and
six
art
books
at
a
guinea
travel
books
at
fifteen
shillings
flighty
historical
works
at
and
cheap
editions
of
montaigne
essays
and
robinson
crusoe
at
a
shilling
some
idea
of
his
business
methods
may
be
derived
from
the
fact
that
it
pleased
him
to
reflect
that
all
the
other
publishers
were
producing
exactly
the
same
books
as
he
was
and
though
he
would
admit
that
the
trade
had
been
ruined
by
competition
and
the
outrageous
royalties
demanded
by
successful
authors
and
further
that
he
made
a
loss
on
every
separate
department
of
his
business
in
some
mysterious
fashion
the
business
as
a
whole
continued
to
pay
him
very
well
he
left
the
active
part
of
the
management
to
a
confidential
clerk
and
contented
himself
with
signing
cheques
and
interviewing
authors
with
such
a
publisher
the
fate
of
our
author
book
was
never
in
doubt
if
it
was
lacking
in
those
qualities
that
might
be
expected
to
commend
it
to
the
reading
public
it
was
conspicuously
rich
in
those
merits
that
determine
the
favourable
judgment
of
publishers
readers
it
was
above
all
things
a
gentlemanly
book
without
violence
and
without
eccentricities
it
was
carefully
and
grammatically
written
but
it
had
not
that
exotic
literary
flavour
which
is
so
tiresome
on
a
long
railway
journey
it
could
be
put
into
the
hands
of
any
schoolgirl
and
at
most
would
merely
send
her
to
sleep
the
only
thing
that
could
be
said
against
it
was
that
the
author
dread
of
inspiration
had
made
it
grievously
dull
but
it
was
the
opinion
that
after
a
glut
of
sensational
fiction
the
public
had
come
to
regard
dullness
as
the
of
literary
merit
he
had
no
illusions
as
to
its
possible
success
but
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
that
he
could
not
lose
any
money
on
it
so
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
author
inviting
him
to
an
interview
as
soon
as
he
had
read
the
letter
the
author
told
himself
that
he
had
been
certain
all
along
that
his
book
would
be
accepted
nevertheless
he
went
to
the
interview
moved
by
certain
emotional
flutterings
against
which
circumstance
had
guarded
him
ever
since
his
boyhood
he
found
this
mild
excitation
of
the
nervous
system
by
no
means
unpleasant
it
was
like
digesting
a
new
and
subtle
liqueur
that
made
him
and
tingled
in
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
recalled
a
phrase
that
had
greatly
pleased
him
in
the
early
days
of
his
novel
as
the
sun
colours
flowers
so
art
colours
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
beginning
to
come
true
and
that
life
was
already
presenting
itself
to
him
in
a
gayer
brighter
dress
he
reached
the
publisher
office
therefore
in
an
unwontedly
receptive
mood
and
was
tremendously
impressed
by
the
rudeness
of
the
clerks
who
treated
authors
as
mendicants
and
expressed
their
opinion
of
literature
by
handling
books
as
if
they
were
bundles
of
firewood
the
publisher
looked
at
him
under
heavy
eyelids
recognised
his
position
in
the
social
scale
and
reflected
with
satisfaction
that
his
acquaintances
could
be
relied
on
to
purchase
at
least
a
hundred
copies
the
interview
did
not
at
all
take
the
lines
that
the
author
in
his
innocence
had
expected
and
in
a
surprisingly
short
space
of
time
he
found
himself
bowed
out
with
the
duplicate
of
a
contract
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
in
the
outer
office
the
confidential
clerk
took
him
in
hand
and
led
him
to
the
door
of
an
enormous
cellar
lit
by
electricity
and
filled
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
bales
and
heaps
of
books
books
said
the
confidential
clerk
with
the
smile
of
a
gamekeeper
displaying
his
pheasants
there
are
a
great
many
the
author
said
timidly
of
course
we
do
not
keep
our
stock
here
the
clerk
explained
these
are
just
samples
it
was
sometimes
necessary
to
remind
inexperienced
writers
that
the
publication
of
their
first
book
was
only
a
trivial
incident
in
the
history
of
a
great
publishing
house
the
author
had
a
sad
vision
of
his
novel
as
a
little
brick
in
a
monstrous
pyramid
built
of
books
and
the
clerk
mentally
decided
that
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
turn
up
every
day
at
the
office
to
ask
them
how
they
were
getting
on
the
author
was
a
little
dazed
when
he
emerged
into
the
street
and
the
sunshine
his
book
which
an
hour
before
had
seemed
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
had
become
almost
insignificant
in
the
light
of
that
vast
collection
of
printed
matter
and
in
some
subtle
way
he
felt
that
he
had
dwindled
with
it
the
publisher
had
praised
it
without
enthusiasm
and
had
not
specified
any
of
its
merits
he
had
not
even
commented
on
his
fantastic
use
of
the
colon
the
author
had
lived
with
it
now
for
many
months
it
had
become
a
part
of
his
personality
and
he
felt
that
he
had
betrayed
himself
in
delivering
it
into
the
hands
of
strangers
who
could
not
understand
it
he
had
the
reticence
of
the
englishman
and
though
he
told
himself
reassuringly
that
his
novel
in
no
way
reflected
his
private
life
he
could
not
quite
overcome
the
sentiment
that
it
was
a
little
vulgar
to
allow
alien
eyes
to
read
the
product
of
his
most
intimate
thoughts
he
had
really
been
shocked
at
the
way
in
which
every
one
at
the
office
had
spoken
of
his
book
and
the
sight
of
all
the
other
books
with
which
it
would
soon
be
inextricably
confused
had
emphasised
the
painful
impression
this
all
seemed
to
rob
the
author
calling
of
its
presumed
distinction
and
he
looked
at
the
men
and
women
who
passed
him
on
the
pavement
and
wondered
whether
they
too
had
written
books
this
mood
lasted
for
some
weeks
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
received
the
proofs
which
he
read
and
with
real
pleasure
before
setting
himself
to
correcting
them
with
meticulous
care
he
performed
this
task
with
such
conscientiousness
and
made
so
many
minor
alterations
he
changed
most
of
those
flighty
colons
to
more
conventional
semicolons
that
the
confidential
clerk
swore
terribly
when
he
glanced
at
the
proofs
before
handing
them
to
a
boy
with
instructions
to
remove
of
the
offending
emendations
a
week
or
two
later
there
happened
one
of
those
strange
little
incidents
that
make
modern
literary
history
it
was
a
bright
sunny
afternoon
the
publisher
had
been
lunching
with
the
star
author
of
the
firm
a
novelist
whose
books
were
read
wherever
the
british
flag
waved
and
there
was
a
circulating
library
to
distribute
them
and
now
in
the
warm
twilight
of
the
lowered
blinds
he
was
enjoying
profound
thoughts
delicately
tinted
by
burgundy
and
old
port
the
shrewdest
men
make
mistakes
and
certainly
it
was
hardly
wise
of
the
confidential
clerk
to
choose
this
peaceful
moment
to
speak
about
our
author
book
i
suppose
we
shall
print
a
thousand
he
said
five
thousand
ejaculated
the
publisher
what
was
he
thinking
about
was
he
filling
up
an
imaginary
statement
or
was
he
trying
to
estimate
the
number
of
butterflies
that
seemed
to
float
in
the
amber
shadows
of
the
room
the
clerk
did
not
know
i
suppose
you
mean
one
thousand
sir
he
said
gently
the
publisher
was
now
wide
awake
he
had
lost
all
his
butterflies
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
allow
himself
to
be
sleepy
in
the
afternoon
i
said
five
thousand
the
clerk
bit
his
lip
and
left
the
room
the
author
never
heard
of
this
brief
dialogue
probably
if
he
had
been
present
he
would
have
missed
its
significance
he
would
never
have
connected
it
with
the
flood
of
paragraphs
that
appeared
in
the
press
announcing
that
the
acumen
of
the
publisher
had
discovered
a
new
author
of
genius
paragraphs
wherein
he
was
compared
with
dickens
thackeray
flaubert
richardson
sir
walter
besant
thomas
browne
and
the
author
of
an
englishwoman
as
it
was
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
wonder
why
the
publisher
should
spend
so
much
money
on
advertising
a
book
of
which
he
had
seemed
to
have
but
a
appreciation
after
all
it
was
his
book
and
the
author
felt
that
it
was
only
natural
that
as
the
hour
of
publication
drew
near
the
world
of
letters
should
show
signs
of
a
dignified
excitement
iii
the
critic
errant
there
are
some
emotions
so
intimate
that
the
most
intrepid
writer
hesitates
to
chronicle
them
lest
it
should
be
inferred
that
he
himself
is
in
the
confessional
we
have
endeavoured
to
show
our
author
as
a
with
his
nerves
well
under
control
and
an
honest
contempt
for
emotionalism
in
the
stronger
sex
but
his
feelings
in
the
face
of
the
first
little
bundle
of
reviews
sent
him
by
the
agency
would
prove
this
portrait
incomplete
he
noticed
with
a
vague
astonishment
that
the
flimsy
scraps
of
paper
were
trembling
in
his
fingers
like
banknotes
in
the
hands
of
a
gambler
and
he
laid
them
down
on
the
in
disgust
of
the
feminine
weakness
this
unmistakable
proof
that
he
had
written
a
book
a
real
book
made
him
at
once
happy
and
uneasy
these
fragments
of
smudged
prints
were
his
passport
into
a
new
and
delightful
world
they
were
it
might
be
said
the
name
of
his
destination
in
the
great
republic
of
letters
and
yet
he
hesitated
to
look
at
them
he
heard
of
the
curious
blindness
of
authors
that
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
detect
the
most
egregious
failings
in
their
own
work
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
might
be
his
malady
why
had
he
published
his
book
he
felt
at
that
moment
that
he
had
taken
too
great
a
risk
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
have
had
it
privately
printed
and
contented
himself
with
distributing
it
among
his
friends
but
these
people
were
paid
for
writing
about
books
these
critics
who
had
sent
keats
to
his
gallipots
and
swinburne
to
his
might
well
have
failed
to
have
recognised
that
his
book
was
sacred
because
it
was
his
own
when
he
had
at
last
achieved
a
fatalistic
tranquillity
he
once
more
picked
up
the
notices
and
this
time
he
read
them
through
carefully
the
quoted
shakespeare
the
compared
him
with
christopher
north
the
thought
that
his
style
resembled
that
of
macaulay
but
they
were
unanimous
in
praising
his
book
without
reservation
it
seemed
to
the
author
that
he
was
listening
to
the
authentic
voice
of
fame
he
rested
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
dreamed
long
dreams
he
could
afford
in
this
hour
of
his
triumph
to
forget
the
annoyances
he
had
undergone
since
his
book
was
first
accepted
the
publisher
with
a
large
first
edition
to
dispose
of
had
been
rather
more
than
firm
with
the
author
he
had
changed
the
title
of
the
book
from
earth
returns
a
title
that
had
seemed
to
the
author
dignified
and
pleasantly
literary
to
the
improbable
marquis
which
seemed
to
him
to
mean
nothing
at
all
moreover
instead
of
giving
the
book
a
quiet
and
scholarly
exterior
he
had
bound
it
in
boards
of
an
injudicious
heliotrope
inset
with
a
nasty
little
coloured
picture
of
a
young
woman
with
a
bernard
dog
this
binding
revolted
the
author
who
objected
with
some
reason
that
in
all
his
book
there
was
no
mention
of
a
dog
of
that
description
or
indeed
of
any
dog
at
all
the
book
was
wrapped
in
an
outer
cover
that
bore
a
recommendation
of
its
contents
starting
with
a
hideous
split
infinitive
and
describing
it
as
an
exquisite
social
comedy
written
from
within
on
the
whole
it
seemed
to
the
author
that
his
book
was
flying
false
and
undesirable
colours
and
since
art
lies
outside
the
domesticities
he
was
hardly
relieved
when
his
wife
told
him
that
she
thought
the
binding
was
very
pretty
the
author
had
shuddered
no
less
at
the
little
paragraphs
that
the
publisher
had
inserted
in
the
newspapers
concerning
his
birth
and
education
wherein
he
was
bracketed
with
other
writers
whose
careers
at
the
university
had
been
equally
undistinguished
but
now
that
like
byron
he
found
himself
famous
among
the
bacon
and
eggs
he
was
in
no
mood
to
remember
these
past
vexations
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
breakfast
he
withdrew
himself
to
his
study
and
wrote
half
an
essay
on
the
republic
of
letters
in
a
country
wherein
fifteen
novels
or
is
it
fifty
are
published
every
day
of
the
year
the
publisher
account
of
the
goods
he
sells
is
bound
to
have
a
certain
value
money
talks
as
arnold
bennett
once
observed
indeed
today
it
is
grown
quite
garrulous
and
when
a
publisher
spends
a
lot
of
money
on
advertising
a
book
the
inference
is
that
some
one
believes
the
book
to
be
good
this
will
not
secure
a
book
good
notices
but
it
will
secure
it
notices
of
some
kind
or
other
and
that
as
every
publisher
knows
is
of
the
battle
the
average
critic
today
is
an
old
young
man
who
has
not
failed
in
literature
or
art
possibly
because
he
has
not
tried
to
accomplish
anything
in
either
by
the
time
he
has
acquired
some
skill
in
criticism
he
has
generally
ceased
to
be
a
critic
through
no
fault
of
his
own
but
through
sheer
weariness
of
spirit
when
a
man
is
very
young
he
can
dance
upon
everyone
who
has
not
written
a
masterpiece
with
a
light
heart
but
after
this
period
of
joyous
savagery
there
follows
fatigue
and
a
certain
pity
the
critic
loses
sight
of
his
first
magnificent
standards
and
becomes
grateful
for
even
the
smallest
merit
in
the
books
he
is
compelled
to
read
like
a
mother
giving
a
powder
to
her
child
he
is
at
pains
to
disguise
his
timid
censure
with
a
teaspoonful
of
jam
as
the
years
pass
by
he
becomes
afraid
of
these
books
that
continue
to
appear
in
unreasonable
profusion
and
that
have
long
ago
destroyed
his
faith
in
literature
his
love
of
reading
his
sense
of
humour
and
the
colouring
matter
of
his
hair
he
realises
with
a
dreadful
sense
of
the
infinite
that
when
he
is
dead
and
buried
this
torrent
of
books
will
overwhelm
the
individualities
of
his
successors
bound
like
himself
to
a
lifelong
examination
of
the
insignificant
timidity
is
certainly
the
note
of
modern
criticism
which
is
rarely
roused
to
indignation
save
when
confronted
by
the
infrequent
outrage
of
some
intellectual
anarchist
if
the
critics
of
the
more
important
journals
were
not
so
enthusiastic
as
their
provincial
confreres
they
were
at
least
gentle
with
the
improbable
marquis
a
critic
of
genius
would
have
said
that
such
books
were
not
worth
writing
still
less
worth
reading
an
outspoken
critic
would
have
said
that
it
was
too
dull
to
be
an
acceptable
presentation
of
a
life
that
we
all
find
interesting
as
it
was
most
of
the
critics
praised
the
style
in
which
it
was
written
because
it
was
quite
impossible
to
call
it
an
enthralling
or
even
an
entertaining
book
some
of
the
younger
critics
who
still
retained
an
interest
in
their
own
personalities
discovered
that
its
vacuity
made
it
a
convenient
mirror
by
means
of
which
they
would
display
the
progress
of
their
own
genius
in
common
gratitude
they
had
to
close
these
manifestations
of
their
merit
with
a
word
or
two
in
praise
of
the
book
they
were
professing
to
review
the
improbable
marquis
was
very
favourably
received
by
the
press
in
general
it
was
as
the
publisher
made
haste
to
point
out
in
his
advertisements
a
book
of
the
year
and
reassured
by
its
flippant
exterior
the
libraries
and
the
public
bought
it
with
avidity
the
author
pasted
his
swollen
collection
of
into
an
album
and
carefully
revised
his
novel
in
case
a
second
edition
should
be
called
for
there
was
one
review
which
he
had
read
more
often
than
any
of
the
others
and
nevertheless
he
hesitated
to
include
it
in
his
collection
this
book
wrote
the
anonymous
reviewer
is
as
nearly
faultless
a
book
may
be
that
possesses
no
positive
merit
it
differs
only
from
of
the
novels
that
are
produced
today
in
being
more
carefully
written
the
author
had
nothing
to
say
and
he
has
said
it
that
was
all
three
malignant
lines
in
a
paper
of
no
commercial
importance
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
passed
round
the
publisher
office
with
an
appreciative
chuckle
in
the
face
of
the
general
amiability
of
the
press
such
a
notice
in
an
obscure
journal
could
do
the
book
no
harm
only
the
author
sat
hour
after
hour
in
his
study
with
that
diminutive
scrap
of
paper
before
him
on
the
table
and
wondered
if
it
was
true
iv
fame
it
was
some
little
time
before
the
public
the
mysterious
section
of
the
public
that
reads
works
of
fiction
discovered
that
the
publisher
aided
by
the
normal
of
the
critics
had
persuaded
them
to
sacrifice
some
of
their
scant
hours
of
intellectual
recreation
on
a
work
of
portentous
dullness
therefor
the
literary
audience
has
its
sense
of
humour
they
amused
themselves
for
a
while
by
recommending
the
book
to
their
friends
and
the
sales
crept
steadily
up
to
four
thousand
and
there
stayed
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
finality
if
the
book
had
had
any
real
literary
merit
its
life
would
have
started
at
that
point
for
the
weary
comments
of
reviewers
and
the
strident
outcries
of
publishers
tend
to
obscure
rather
than
reveal
the
permanent
value
of
a
book
but
six
months
after
publication
the
improbable
marquis
was
completely
forgotten
save
by
the
booksellers
who
found
themselves
embarrassed
with
a
number
of
books
for
which
no
one
seemed
anxious
to
pay
in
spite
of
the
striking
heliotrope
binding
the
publisher
who
was
aware
of
this
circumstance
offered
the
author
five
hundred
copies
at
cost
price
and
the
author
bought
them
and
sent
them
to
public
libraries
without
examining
the
motive
for
his
action
too
closely
there
were
moments
when
he
regarded
the
success
of
his
book
with
suspicion
he
would
have
preferred
the
praise
that
had
greeted
it
to
have
been
less
violent
and
more
clearly
defined
of
all
the
criticisms
the
only
one
that
lingered
in
his
mind
was
the
curt
comment
the
author
had
nothing
to
say
and
he
has
said
it
he
thought
it
was
unfair
but
he
had
remembered
it
at
the
same
time
in
examining
his
own
character
he
could
not
find
that
masterfulness
that
seemed
to
him
necessary
in
a
great
man
but
for
the
most
part
he
was
content
to
accept
his
new
honours
with
a
placid
satisfaction
and
to
smile
genially
upon
a
world
that
was
eager
to
credit
him
with
qualities
that
possibly
he
did
not
possess
for
if
his
book
was
no
longer
read
his
fame
as
an
author
seemed
to
be
established
on
a
rock
society
with
a
larger
s
than
that
which
he
had
hitherto
adorned
was
delighted
to
find
after
two
notable
failures
that
genius
could
still
be
presentable
and
the
author
was
rather
more
than
that
he
was
rich
he
had
that
air
of
the
distinguished
army
officer
which
falls
so
easily
to
those
who
occupy
the
pleasant
position
of
sleeping
partner
in
the
city
and
he
had
just
the
right
shade
of
amused
modesty
with
which
to
meet
inquiries
as
to
his
literary
intentions
in
a
word
he
was
an
author
of
whom
any
country
even
france
that
prolific
parent
of
presentable
authors
would
have
been
proud
even
his
wife
who
had
thought
it
an
excellent
joke
that
her
husband
should
have
written
a
book
had
to
take
him
seriously
as
an
author
when
she
found
that
their
social
position
was
steadily
improving
with
feminine
tact
she
gave
him
a
on
his
birthday
from
which
he
was
meant
to
conclude
that
she
believed
in
his
mission
as
an
artist
meanwhile
with
the
world
at
his
feet
the
author
spent
an
appreciable
part
of
his
time
in
visiting
the
bookshops
and
buying
copies
of
his
book
absurdly
cheap
he
carried
these
waifs
home
and
stored
them
in
an
attic
secretly
for
he
would
have
found
it
hard
to
explain
his
motives
to
the
intellectually
childless
in
the
first
flush
of
authorship
he
had
sent
a
number
of
presentation
copies
of
his
book
to
writers
whom
he
admired
and
he
noticed
without
bitterness
that
some
of
these
volumes
with
their
neatly
turned
inscriptions
were
coming
back
to
him
through
this
channel
at
all
the
bookshops
he
saw
young
men
looking
over
the
books
without
buying
them
and
he
thought
these
must
be
authors
but
he
was
too
shy
to
speak
to
them
though
he
had
a
great
longing
to
know
other
writers
he
wanted
to
ask
them
questions
concerning
their
methods
of
work
for
he
was
having
trouble
with
his
second
book
he
had
read
an
article
in
which
the
writer
said
that
the
great
fault
of
modern
fiction
was
that
authors
were
more
concerned
to
produce
good
chapters
than
to
produce
good
books
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
his
first
book
he
had
only
aimed
at
good
sentences
but
he
knew
no
one
with
whom
he
could
discuss
such
matters
one
day
he
found
a
copy
of
the
improbable
marquis
in
the
charing
cross
road
and
was
glancing
through
it
with
interest
when
a
voice
at
his
elbow
said
i
should
buy
that
if
i
were
you
sir
it
no
good
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
wild
young
man
with
bright
eyes
and
an
untidy
black
beard
but
it
mine
i
wrote
it
cried
the
author
the
young
man
stared
at
him
in
dismay
i
sorry
i
did
know
he
blurted
out
and
faded
away
into
the
crowd
the
author
gazed
after
him
wistfully
regretting
that
he
had
not
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
ask
him
to
lunch
perhaps
the
young
man
could
have
told
him
how
he
ought
to
write
his
second
book
for
somehow
or
other
at
the
very
moment
when
his
literary
position
seemed
most
secure
in
the
eyes
of
his
wife
and
his
friends
the
author
had
lost
all
confidence
in
his
own
powers
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
every
night
and
was
supposed
by
an
admiring
and
almost
timorous
household
to
be
producing
masterpieces
when
in
reality
he
was
conducting
a
series
of
barren
skirmishes
between
the
critical
and
the
creative
elements
of
his
nature
he
would
write
a
chapter
or
two
in
a
fine
fury
of
composition
and
then
would
read
what
he
had
written
with
intense
disgust
he
felt
that
his
second
book
ought
to
be
better
than
his
first
and
he
doubted
whether
he
would
even
be
able
to
write
anything
half
so
good
in
his
hour
of
disillusionment
he
recalled
the
anonymous
critic
who
had
treated
the
improbable
marquis
with
such
scant
respect
and
he
wrote
to
him
asking
him
to
expand
his
judgment
he
was
prepared
to
be
wounded
by
the
answer
but
the
form
it
took
surprised
him
in
reply
to
his
temperate
and
courteous
letter
the
critic
sent
a
postcard
bearing
only
five
short
words
why
did
you
write
it
this
was
bad
manners
but
the
author
was
sensible
enough
to
see
that
it
might
be
good
criticism
especially
as
he
found
some
difficulty
in
answering
the
question
why
had
he
written
a
book
not
for
money
or
for
fame
or
to
express
a
personality
of
which
he
saw
no
reason
to
be
proud
all
his
friends
had
said
that
he
ought
to
write
a
novel
and
he
had
thought
that
he
could
write
a
better
one
than
the
average
but
he
had
to
admit
that
such
motives
seemed
to
him
insufficient
there
was
perhaps
some
mysterious
force
that
drove
men
to
create
works
of
art
and
the
critic
had
seen
that
his
book
had
lacked
this
necessary
impulse
in
the
light
of
this
new
theory
the
author
was
roused
by
a
sense
of
injustice
he
felt
that
it
should
be
possible
for
anyone
to
write
a
good
book
if
they
took
sufficient
pains
and
he
set
himself
to
work
again
with
a
savage
and
unproductive
energy
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
whole
should
be
greater
than
any
part
his
chapters
broke
up
into
sentences
and
his
sentences
into
forlorn
and
ungregarious
words
when
he
looked
to
his
first
book
for
comfort
he
found
the
same
horrid
phenomenon
taking
place
in
its
familiar
pages
sometimes
when
he
was
disheartened
by
his
fruitless
efforts
he
slipped
out
into
the
streets
fixing
his
attention
on
concrete
objects
to
rest
his
tired
mind
but
he
could
not
help
noticing
that
london
had
discovered
the
secret
which
made
his
intellectual
life
a
torment
the
streets
were
more
than
a
mere
assemblage
of
houses
london
herself
was
more
than
a
tangled
skein
of
streets
and
overhead
heaven
was
more
than
a
of
individual
stars
what
was
this
secret
that
made
words
into
a
book
houses
into
cities
and
restless
and
measurable
stars
into
an
unchanging
and
immeasurable
universe
the
bird
in
the
garden
the
room
in
which
the
burchell
family
lived
in
love
street
was
underground
and
depended
for
light
and
air
on
a
grating
let
into
the
pavement
above
uncle
john
who
was
a
queer
one
had
filled
the
area
with
green
plants
and
creepers
in
boxes
and
tins
hanging
from
the
grating
so
that
the
room
itself
obtained
very
little
light
indeed
but
there
was
always
a
nice
bright
green
place
for
the
people
sitting
in
it
to
look
at
toby
who
had
peeped
into
the
areas
of
other
little
boys
knew
that
his
was
of
quite
exceptional
beauty
and
it
was
with
a
certain
awe
that
he
helped
uncle
john
to
tend
the
plants
in
the
morning
watering
them
and
taking
the
pieces
of
paper
and
straws
that
had
fallen
through
the
grating
from
their
hair
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
have
straws
in
ones
hair
uncle
john
would
say
gravely
and
toby
knew
that
it
was
true
it
was
in
the
morning
after
they
had
just
been
watered
that
the
plants
looked
and
smelt
best
and
when
the
sun
shone
through
the
grating
and
the
diamonds
were
shining
and
falling
through
the
forest
toby
would
tell
the
baby
about
the
great
bird
who
would
one
day
come
flying
through
the
trees
a
bird
of
all
colours
ugly
and
beautiful
with
a
harsh
sweet
voice
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
everything
said
toby
though
of
course
he
was
only
repeating
a
story
his
uncle
john
had
told
him
there
were
other
people
in
the
big
dark
room
besides
toby
and
uncle
john
and
the
baby
dark
people
who
flitted
to
and
fro
about
secret
matters
people
called
father
and
mother
and
hearn
who
were
apt
to
kick
if
they
found
you
in
their
way
and
who
never
laughed
except
at
nights
and
then
they
laughed
too
loudly
they
will
frighten
the
bird
thought
toby
but
they
were
kind
to
uncle
john
because
he
had
a
pension
toby
slept
in
a
corner
on
the
ground
beside
the
baby
and
when
father
and
hearn
fought
at
nights
he
would
wake
up
and
watch
and
shiver
but
when
this
happened
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
baby
was
laughing
at
him
and
he
would
pinch
her
to
make
her
stop
one
night
when
the
men
were
fighting
very
fiercely
and
mother
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
table
uncle
john
rose
from
his
bed
and
began
singing
in
a
great
voice
it
was
a
song
toby
knew
very
well
about
trafalgar
bay
but
it
frightened
the
two
men
a
great
deal
because
they
thought
uncle
john
would
be
too
mad
to
fetch
the
pension
any
more
next
day
he
was
quite
well
however
and
he
and
toby
found
a
large
green
caterpillar
in
the
garden
among
the
plants
this
is
a
fact
of
great
importance
said
uncle
john
stroking
it
with
a
little
stick
it
is
a
sign
toby
used
to
lie
awake
at
nights
after
that
and
listen
for
the
bird
but
he
only
heard
the
clatter
of
feet
on
the
pavement
and
the
screaming
of
engines
far
away
later
there
came
a
new
young
woman
to
live
in
the
cellar
not
a
dark
person
but
a
person
you
could
see
and
speak
to
she
patted
toby
on
the
head
but
when
she
saw
the
baby
she
caught
it
to
her
breast
and
cried
over
it
calling
it
pretty
names
at
first
father
and
hearn
were
both
very
kind
to
her
and
mother
used
to
sit
all
day
in
the
corner
with
burning
eyes
but
after
a
time
the
three
used
to
laugh
together
at
nights
as
before
and
the
woman
would
sit
with
her
wet
face
and
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
bird
with
toby
and
the
baby
and
uncle
john
who
was
a
queer
one
all
we
have
to
do
uncle
john
would
say
is
to
keep
the
garden
clean
and
tidy
and
to
water
the
plants
every
morning
so
that
they
may
be
very
green
and
toby
would
go
and
whisper
this
to
the
baby
and
she
would
stare
at
the
ceiling
with
large
stupid
eyes
there
came
a
time
when
toby
was
very
sick
and
he
lay
all
day
in
his
corner
wondering
about
wonder
sometimes
the
room
in
which
he
lay
became
so
small
that
he
was
choked
for
lack
of
air
sometimes
it
was
so
large
that
he
screamed
out
because
he
felt
lonely
he
could
not
see
the
dark
people
then
at
all
but
only
uncle
john
and
the
woman
who
told
him
in
whispers
that
her
name
was
mummie
she
called
him
sonny
which
is
a
very
pretty
name
and
when
toby
heard
it
he
felt
a
tickling
in
his
sides
which
he
knew
to
be
gladness
mummie
face
was
wet
and
warm
and
soft
and
she
was
very
fond
of
kissing
every
morning
uncle
john
would
lift
toby
up
and
show
him
the
garden
and
toby
would
slip
out
of
his
arms
and
walk
among
the
trees
and
plants
and
the
place
would
grow
bigger
and
bigger
until
it
was
all
the
world
and
toby
would
lose
himself
amongst
the
tangle
of
trees
and
flowers
and
creepers
he
would
see
butterflies
there
and
tame
animals
and
the
sky
was
full
of
birds
of
all
colours
ugly
and
beautiful
but
he
knew
that
none
of
these
was
the
bird
because
their
voices
were
only
sweet
sometimes
he
showed
these
wonders
to
a
little
boy
called
toby
who
held
his
hand
and
called
him
uncle
john
sometimes
he
showed
them
to
his
mummie
and
he
himself
was
toby
but
always
when
he
came
back
he
found
himself
lying
in
uncle
john
arms
and
weary
from
his
walk
would
fall
into
a
pleasant
dreamless
sleep
it
seemed
to
toby
at
this
time
that
a
veil
hung
about
him
which
dim
and
unreal
in
itself
served
to
make
all
things
dim
and
unreal
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
asleep
or
awake
so
strange
was
life
so
vivid
were
his
dreams
mummie
uncle
john
the
baby
toby
himself
came
with
a
flicker
of
the
veil
and
disappeared
vaguely
without
cause
it
would
happen
that
toby
would
be
speaking
to
uncle
john
and
suddenly
he
would
find
himself
looking
into
the
large
eyes
of
the
baby
turned
stupidly
towards
the
ceiling
and
again
the
baby
would
be
toby
himself
a
hot
dry
little
body
without
legs
or
arms
that
swayed
suspended
as
if
by
magic
a
foot
above
the
bed
then
there
was
the
vision
of
two
small
feet
that
moved
a
long
way
off
and
toby
would
watch
them
curiously
as
kittens
do
their
tails
without
knowing
the
cause
of
their
motion
it
was
all
very
wonderful
and
very
strange
and
day
by
day
the
veil
grew
thicker
there
was
no
need
to
wake
when
the
sleeptime
was
so
pleasant
there
were
no
dark
people
to
kick
you
in
that
dreamy
place
and
yet
toby
woke
woke
to
a
life
and
in
a
place
which
he
had
never
known
before
he
found
himself
on
a
heap
of
rags
in
a
large
cellar
which
depended
for
its
light
on
a
grating
let
into
the
pavement
of
the
street
above
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
area
and
swinging
from
the
grating
were
a
few
sickly
grimy
plants
in
pots
there
must
have
been
a
fine
sunset
up
above
for
a
faint
red
glow
came
through
the
bars
and
touched
the
leaves
of
the
plants
there
was
a
lighted
candle
standing
in
a
bottle
on
the
table
and
the
cellar
seemed
full
of
people
at
the
table
itself
two
men
and
a
woman
were
drinking
though
they
were
already
drunk
and
beyond
in
a
corner
toby
could
see
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
tall
old
man
beside
him
there
crouched
a
woman
with
a
faded
pretty
face
and
between
toby
and
the
rest
of
the
room
there
stood
a
box
in
which
lay
a
baby
with
large
wakeful
eyes
toby
body
tingled
with
excitement
for
this
was
a
new
thing
he
had
never
seen
it
before
he
had
never
seen
anything
before
the
voice
of
the
woman
at
the
table
rose
and
fell
steadily
without
a
pause
she
was
abusing
the
other
woman
and
the
two
drunken
men
were
laughing
at
her
and
shouting
her
on
toby
thought
the
other
woman
lacked
spirit
because
she
stayed
crouching
on
the
floor
and
said
nothing
at
last
the
woman
stopped
her
abuse
and
one
of
the
men
turned
and
shouted
an
order
to
the
woman
on
the
floor
she
stood
up
and
came
towards
him
hesitating
this
annoyed
the
man
and
he
swore
at
her
brutally
when
she
came
near
enough
he
knocked
her
down
with
his
fist
and
all
the
three
burst
out
laughing
toby
was
so
excited
that
he
knelt
up
in
his
corner
and
clapped
his
hands
but
the
others
did
not
notice
because
the
old
man
was
up
and
swaying
wildly
over
the
woman
he
seemed
to
be
threatening
the
man
who
had
struck
her
and
that
one
was
evidently
afraid
of
him
for
he
rose
unsteadily
and
lifted
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
above
his
head
to
use
as
a
weapon
the
old
man
raised
his
fist
and
the
chair
fell
heavily
on
to
his
wrinkled
forehead
and
he
dropped
to
the
ground
the
woman
at
the
table
cried
out
the
pension
in
her
shrill
voice
and
then
they
were
all
quiet
looking
then
it
seemed
to
toby
that
through
the
forest
there
came
flying
with
a
harsh
sweet
voice
and
a
tumult
of
wings
a
bird
of
all
colours
ugly
and
beautiful
and
he
knew
though
later
there
might
be
people
to
tell
him
otherwise
that
that
was
the
end
of
everything
children
of
the
moon
the
boy
stood
at
the
place
where
the
park
trees
stopped
and
the
smooth
lawns
slid
away
gently
to
the
great
house
he
was
dressed
only
in
a
pair
of
ragged
knickerbockers
and
a
gaping
buttonless
shirt
so
that
his
legs
and
neck
and
chest
shone
silver
bare
in
the
moonlight
by
day
he
had
a
mass
of
rough
golden
hair
but
now
it
seemed
to
brood
above
his
head
like
a
black
cloud
that
made
his
face
deathly
white
by
comparison
on
his
arms
there
lay
a
great
heap
of
gleaming
roses
and
lilies
spoil
of
the
park
their
cool
petals
touched
his
cheek
and
filled
his
nostrils
with
aching
scent
he
felt
his
arms
smarting
here
and
there
where
the
thorns
of
the
roses
had
torn
them
in
the
dark
but
these
delicate
caresses
of
pain
only
served
to
deepen
to
him
the
wonder
of
the
night
that
wrapped
him
about
like
a
cloak
behind
him
there
dreamed
the
black
woods
and
over
his
head
multitudinous
stars
quivered
and
balanced
in
space
but
these
things
were
nothing
to
him
for
far
across
the
lawn
that
was
spread
with
a
web
of
mist
there
gleamed
for
his
eager
eyes
the
splendour
of
a
fairy
palace
red
and
orange
and
gold
the
lights
of
the
fairy
revels
shone
from
a
hundred
windows
and
filled
him
with
wonder
that
he
should
see
with
wakeful
eyes
the
jewels
that
he
had
desired
so
long
in
sleep
he
could
only
gaze
and
gaze
until
his
straining
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
set
the
enchanted
lights
dancing
in
the
dark
on
his
ears
that
heard
no
more
the
crying
of
the
and
the
quick
stir
of
the
rabbits
in
the
brake
there
fell
the
strains
of
far
music
the
flowers
in
his
arms
seemed
to
sway
to
it
and
his
heart
beat
to
the
deep
pulse
of
the
night
so
enraptured
were
his
senses
that
he
did
not
notice
the
coming
of
the
girl
and
she
was
able
to
examine
him
closely
before
she
called
to
him
softly
through
the
moonlight
boy
boy
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
he
swung
round
and
looked
at
her
with
startled
eyes
he
saw
her
excited
little
face
and
her
white
dress
are
you
a
fairy
he
asked
hoarsely
for
the
was
in
his
voice
no
she
said
i
a
little
girl
you
a
i
suppose
he
stayed
silent
regarding
her
with
a
puzzled
face
who
was
this
little
white
creature
with
the
tender
voice
that
had
slipped
so
suddenly
out
of
the
night
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
girl
continued
i
come
out
to
have
a
look
at
the
fairies
there
a
ring
down
in
the
wood
you
can
come
with
me
if
you
like
he
nodded
his
head
silently
for
he
was
afraid
to
speak
to
her
and
set
off
through
the
wood
by
her
side
still
clasping
the
flowers
to
his
breast
what
were
you
looking
at
when
i
found
you
she
asked
the
palace
the
fairy
palace
the
boy
muttered
the
palace
the
girl
repeated
why
that
not
a
palace
where
i
live
the
boy
looked
at
her
with
new
awe
if
she
were
a
fairy
but
the
girl
had
noticed
that
his
feet
made
no
sound
beside
her
shoes
do
the
thorns
prick
your
feet
she
asked
but
the
boy
said
nothing
and
they
were
both
silent
for
a
while
the
girl
looking
about
her
keenly
as
she
walked
and
the
boy
watching
her
face
presently
they
came
to
a
wide
pool
where
a
little
tinkling
fountain
threw
bubbles
to
the
hidden
fish
can
you
swim
she
said
to
the
boy
he
shook
his
head
it
a
pity
said
the
girl
we
might
have
had
a
bathe
it
would
be
rather
fun
in
the
dark
but
it
pretty
deep
there
we
better
get
on
to
the
fairy
ring
the
moon
had
flung
queer
shadows
across
the
glade
in
which
the
ring
lay
and
when
they
stood
on
the
edge
listening
intently
the
wood
seemed
to
speak
to
them
with
a
hundred
voices
you
can
take
hold
of
my
hand
if
you
like
said
the
girl
in
a
whisper
the
boy
dropped
his
flowers
about
his
white
feet
and
felt
for
the
girl
hand
in
the
dark
soon
it
lay
in
his
own
a
warm
live
thing
that
stirred
a
little
with
excitement
i
not
afraid
the
girl
said
and
so
they
waited
the
man
came
upon
them
suddenly
from
among
the
silver
birches
he
had
a
knapsack
on
his
back
and
his
hair
was
as
long
as
a
tramp
at
sight
of
him
the
girl
almost
screamed
and
her
hand
trembled
in
the
boy
some
instinct
made
him
hold
it
tighter
what
do
you
want
he
muttered
in
his
hoarse
voice
the
man
was
no
less
astonished
than
the
children
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
he
cried
his
voice
was
mild
and
reassuring
and
the
girl
answered
him
promptly
i
came
out
to
look
for
fairies
oh
that
right
enough
commented
the
man
and
you
he
said
turning
to
the
boy
are
you
after
fairies
too
oh
i
see
picking
flowers
do
you
mean
to
sell
them
the
boy
shook
his
head
for
my
sister
he
said
and
stopped
abruptly
is
your
sister
fond
of
flowers
yes
she
dead
the
man
looked
at
him
gravely
that
a
phrase
he
said
and
phrases
are
the
devil
who
told
you
that
dead
people
like
flowers
they
always
have
them
said
the
boy
blushing
for
shame
of
his
pretty
thought
and
what
are
looking
for
the
girl
interrupted
the
man
made
a
mocking
grimace
and
glanced
around
the
glade
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
being
overheard
dreams
he
said
bluntly
the
girl
pondered
this
for
a
moment
and
your
knapsack
she
began
yes
said
the
man
it
full
of
them
the
children
looked
at
the
knapsack
with
interest
the
girl
fingers
tingling
to
undo
the
straps
of
it
what
are
they
like
she
asked
the
man
gave
a
short
laugh
very
like
yours
and
his
i
expect
when
you
grow
older
young
woman
you
find
there
really
only
one
dream
possible
for
a
sensible
person
but
you
do
want
to
hear
about
my
troubles
this
is
more
in
your
line
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
flageolet
which
he
put
to
his
lips
listen
he
said
to
the
girl
it
seemed
as
though
the
little
tune
had
leapt
from
the
pipe
and
was
dancing
round
the
ring
like
a
real
fairy
while
echo
came
tripping
through
the
trees
to
join
it
the
boy
gaped
and
said
nothing
at
last
when
the
fairy
was
beginning
to
falter
and
echo
was
quite
out
of
breath
the
man
took
the
flageolet
from
his
lips
well
he
said
with
a
smile
thank
you
very
much
said
the
girl
politely
i
think
that
was
very
nice
indeed
oh
boy
she
broke
off
you
hurting
my
hand
the
boy
eyes
were
shining
strangely
and
he
was
waving
his
arms
in
dismay
all
the
wasted
moonlight
he
cried
the
grass
is
quite
wet
with
it
the
girl
turned
to
him
in
surprise
why
boy
you
found
your
voice
after
that
said
the
man
gravely
as
he
put
his
flageolet
back
in
his
pocket
i
think
i
will
show
you
the
inside
of
my
knapsack
the
girl
bent
down
eagerly
while
he
loosened
the
straps
but
gave
a
cry
of
disappointment
when
she
saw
the
contents
pictures
she
said
pictures
echoed
the
man
drily
pictures
of
dreams
i
do
know
how
you
going
to
see
them
perhaps
the
moon
will
do
her
best
the
girl
looked
at
them
nicely
and
passed
them
on
one
by
one
to
the
boy
presently
she
made
a
discovery
oh
boy
she
cried
your
tears
are
spoiling
all
the
pictures
i
sorry
said
the
boy
huskily
i
ca
help
it
i
know
the
man
said
quickly
it
does
matter
a
bit
i
expect
you
seen
these
pictures
before
i
know
them
all
said
the
boy
but
i
have
never
seen
them
the
man
frowned
it
the
devil
he
said
to
himself
when
boys
speak
english
he
turned
suddenly
to
the
girl
who
was
puzzling
over
the
boy
tears
it
time
you
went
back
to
bed
he
said
there
wo
be
any
fairies
tonight
it
too
cold
for
them
the
girl
yawned
i
shall
get
into
a
row
when
i
get
back
if
they
found
it
out
i
do
care
the
moon
is
fading
said
the
boy
suddenly
there
are
no
more
shadows
we
will
see
you
through
the
wood
the
man
continued
and
say
he
put
his
pictures
back
in
his
knapsack
and
then
walked
silently
through
the
murmuring
wood
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
girl
stopped
you
are
a
she
said
to
the
boy
and
you
must
come
any
farther
you
can
give
me
a
kiss
if
you
like
the
boy
did
not
move
but
stayed
regarding
her
awkwardly
i
think
you
are
a
very
silly
boy
said
the
girl
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
she
stalked
away
proudly
into
the
mist
why
did
you
kiss
her
asked
the
man
her
lips
would
burn
me
said
the
boy
the
man
and
the
boy
walked
slowly
across
the
park
now
boy
said
the
man
since
civilisation
has
gone
to
bed
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
hear
your
destiny
i
am
only
a
poor
boy
the
boy
replied
simply
i
do
think
i
have
any
destiny
paradox
said
the
man
is
meant
to
conceal
the
insincerity
of
the
aged
not
to
express
the
simplicity
of
youth
but
i
wander
you
have
made
phrases
tonight
what
are
phrases
what
are
dreams
what
are
roses
what
in
fine
is
the
moon
boy
i
take
you
for
a
you
hold
her
pale
flowers
in
your
arms
her
white
beams
have
caressed
your
limbs
you
prefer
the
kisses
of
her
cool
lips
to
those
of
that
all
this
is
very
well
but
above
all
you
have
the
music
of
her
great
silence
above
all
you
have
her
tears
when
i
played
to
you
on
my
pipe
you
recognised
the
voice
of
your
mother
when
i
showed
you
my
pictures
you
recalled
the
tales
with
which
she
hushed
you
to
sleep
and
so
i
knew
that
you
were
her
son
and
my
little
brother
the
moon
has
always
been
my
friend
said
the
boy
but
i
did
not
know
that
she
was
my
mother
perhaps
your
sister
knows
it
the
happy
dead
are
glad
to
seek
her
for
a
mother
that
is
why
they
are
so
fond
of
white
flowers
we
have
a
mother
at
home
she
works
very
hard
for
us
but
it
is
your
mother
among
the
clouds
who
makes
your
life
beautiful
and
the
beauty
of
your
life
is
the
measure
of
your
days
while
the
boy
reflected
on
these
things
they
had
reached
the
gates
of
the
park
and
they
stole
past
the
silent
lodge
on
to
the
high
road
a
man
was
waiting
there
in
the
shadows
and
when
he
saw
the
companion
he
rushed
out
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
so
i
got
you
he
said
i
do
think
i
let
you
go
again
in
a
hurry
the
son
of
the
moon
gave
a
queer
little
laugh
why
it
taylor
he
said
pleasantly
but
taylor
you
know
you
making
a
great
mistake
very
possibly
said
the
keeper
with
a
laugh
you
see
this
boy
here
taylor
i
assure
you
he
is
much
madder
than
i
am
taylor
looked
at
the
boy
kindly
time
you
were
in
bed
tommy
he
said
taylor
said
the
man
earnestly
this
boy
has
made
three
phrases
if
you
do
lock
him
up
he
will
certainly
become
a
poet
he
will
set
your
precious
world
of
sanity
ablaze
with
the
fire
of
his
mother
the
moon
your
palaces
will
totter
taylor
and
your
kingdoms
become
as
dust
i
have
warned
you
that
right
sir
and
now
you
must
come
with
me
boy
said
the
man
generously
keep
your
liberty
by
grace
of
providence
all
men
in
authority
are
fools
we
shall
meet
again
under
the
light
of
the
moon
with
dreamy
eyes
the
boy
watched
the
departure
of
his
companion
he
had
become
almost
invisible
along
the
road
when
miraculously
as
it
seemed
the
light
of
the
moon
broke
through
the
trees
by
the
wayside
and
lit
up
his
figure
for
a
moment
it
fell
upon
his
head
like
a
halo
and
touched
the
knapsack
of
dreams
with
glory
then
all
was
lost
in
the
blackness
of
night
as
he
turned
homeward
the
boy
felt
a
cold
wind
upon
his
cheek
it
was
the
first
breath
of
dawn
the
coffin
merchant
i
london
on
a
november
sunday
inspired
eustace
reynolds
with
a
melancholy
too
insistent
to
be
ignored
and
too
causeless
to
be
enjoyed
the
grey
sky
overhead
between
the
the
cold
wind
round
every
the
sad
faces
of
the
men
and
women
on
the
pavements
combined
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
ineloquent
misery
eustace
was
sensitive
to
impressions
and
in
spite
of
a
effort
to
remain
a
dispassionate
spectator
of
the
world
melancholy
he
felt
the
chill
of
the
aimless
day
creeping
over
his
spirit
why
was
there
no
sun
no
warmth
no
laughter
on
the
earth
what
had
become
of
all
the
children
who
keep
laughter
like
a
mask
on
the
faces
of
disillusioned
men
the
wind
blew
down
southampton
street
and
chilled
eustace
to
a
shiver
that
passed
away
in
a
shudder
of
disgust
at
the
sombre
colour
of
life
a
windy
sunday
in
london
before
the
lamps
are
lit
tempts
a
man
to
believe
in
the
nobility
of
work
at
the
corner
by
charing
cross
telegraph
office
a
man
thrust
a
handbill
under
his
eyes
but
he
shook
his
head
impatiently
the
blueness
of
the
fingers
that
offered
him
the
paper
was
alone
sufficient
to
make
him
disinclined
to
remove
his
hands
from
his
pockets
even
for
an
instant
but
the
man
would
not
be
dismissed
so
lightly
excuse
me
sir
he
said
following
him
you
have
not
looked
to
see
what
my
bills
are
whatever
they
are
i
do
not
want
them
that
where
you
are
wrong
sir
the
man
said
earnestly
you
will
never
find
life
interesting
if
you
do
not
lie
in
wait
for
the
unexpected
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
that
my
bill
contains
exactly
what
you
do
want
eustace
looked
at
the
man
with
quick
curiosity
his
clothes
were
ragged
and
the
visible
parts
of
his
flesh
were
blue
with
cold
but
his
eyes
were
bright
with
intelligence
and
his
speech
was
that
of
an
educated
man
it
seemed
to
eustace
that
he
was
being
regarded
with
a
keen
expectancy
as
though
his
decision
i
on
the
trivial
point
was
of
real
importance
i
do
know
what
you
are
driving
at
he
said
but
if
it
will
give
you
any
pleasure
i
will
take
one
of
your
bills
though
if
you
argue
with
all
your
clients
as
you
have
with
me
it
must
take
you
a
long
time
to
get
rid
of
them
i
only
offer
them
to
suitable
persons
the
man
said
folding
up
one
of
the
handbills
while
he
spoke
and
i
sure
you
will
not
regret
taking
it
and
he
slipped
the
paper
into
eustace
hand
and
walked
rapidly
away
eustace
looked
after
him
curiously
for
a
moment
and
then
opened
the
paper
in
his
hand
when
his
eyes
comprehended
its
significance
he
gave
a
low
whistle
of
astonishment
you
will
soon
be
warning
a
coffin
it
read
at
gray
inn
road
your
order
will
be
attended
to
with
civility
and
despatch
call
and
see
us
eustace
swung
round
quickly
to
look
for
the
man
but
he
was
out
of
sight
the
wind
was
growing
colder
and
the
lamps
were
beginning
to
shine
out
in
the
greying
streets
eustace
crumpled
the
paper
into
his
overcoat
pocket
and
turned
homewards
how
silly
he
said
to
himself
in
conscious
amusement
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
on
the
pavement
rang
like
an
echo
to
his
laugh
ii
eustace
was
impressionable
but
not
temperamentally
morbid
and
he
was
troubled
a
little
by
the
fact
that
the
gruesomely
bizarre
handbill
continued
to
recur
to
his
mind
the
thing
was
so
manifestly
absurd
he
told
himself
with
conviction
that
it
was
not
worth
a
second
thought
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
thinking
of
it
again
and
again
what
manner
of
undertaker
could
hope
to
obtain
business
by
giving
away
foolish
handbills
in
the
street
really
the
whole
thing
had
the
air
of
a
brainless
practical
joke
yet
his
intellectual
fairness
forced
him
to
admit
that
as
far
as
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
bill
was
concerned
brainlessness
was
out
of
the
question
and
joking
improbable
there
had
been
depths
in
those
little
bright
eyes
which
his
glance
had
not
been
able
to
sound
and
the
manner
in
making
him
accept
the
handbill
had
given
the
whole
transaction
a
kind
of
ludicrous
significance
you
will
soon
be
wanting
a
coffin
eustace
found
himself
turning
the
words
over
and
over
in
his
mind
if
he
had
had
any
near
relations
he
might
have
construed
the
thing
as
an
elaborate
threat
but
he
was
practically
alone
in
the
world
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
not
likely
to
want
a
coffin
for
anyone
but
himself
oh
damn
the
thing
he
said
impatiently
as
he
opened
the
door
of
his
flat
it
is
worth
worrying
about
i
must
let
the
whim
of
some
mad
tradesman
get
on
my
nerves
i
got
no
one
to
bury
anyhow
nevertheless
the
thing
lingered
with
him
all
the
evening
and
when
his
neighbour
the
doctor
came
in
for
a
chat
at
ten
eustace
was
glad
to
show
him
the
strange
handbill
the
doctor
who
had
experienced
the
queer
magics
that
are
practised
to
this
day
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
who
therefore
had
no
nerves
was
delighted
with
so
striking
an
example
of
british
commercial
enterprise
though
mind
you
he
added
gravely
smoothing
the
crumpled
paper
on
his
knee
this
sort
of
thing
might
do
a
lot
of
harm
if
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
nervous
subject
i
should
be
inclined
to
punch
the
head
of
the
ass
who
perpetrated
it
have
you
turned
that
address
up
in
the
post
office
directory
eustace
shook
his
head
and
rose
and
fetched
the
fat
red
book
which
makes
london
an
english
city
together
they
found
the
gray
inn
road
and
ran
their
eyes
down
to
no
coffin
merchant
and
undertaker
not
much
information
there
muttered
the
doctor
coffin
merchant
a
bit
unusual
is
it
queried
eustace
i
suppose
he
manufactures
coffins
wholesale
for
the
trade
still
i
did
know
they
called
themselves
that
anyhow
it
seems
as
though
that
handbill
is
a
genuine
piece
of
downright
foolishness
the
idiot
ought
to
be
stopped
advertising
in
that
way
i
go
and
see
him
myself
tomorrow
said
eustace
bluntly
well
he
given
you
an
invitation
said
the
doctor
so
it
only
polite
of
you
to
go
i
drop
in
here
in
the
evening
to
hear
what
he
like
i
expect
that
you
find
him
as
mad
as
a
hatter
something
like
that
said
eustace
or
he
would
give
handbills
to
people
like
me
i
have
no
one
to
bury
except
myself
no
said
the
doctor
in
the
hall
i
suppose
you
have
do
let
him
measure
you
for
a
coffin
reynolds
eustace
laughed
we
never
know
he
said
sententiously
iii
next
day
was
one
of
those
gorgeous
blue
days
of
which
november
gives
but
few
and
eustace
was
glad
to
run
out
to
wimbledon
for
a
game
of
golf
or
rather
for
two
it
was
therefore
dusk
before
he
made
his
way
to
the
gray
inn
road
in
search
of
the
unexpected
his
attitude
towards
his
errand
despite
the
doctor
laughter
and
the
prosaic
entry
in
the
directory
was
a
little
confused
he
could
not
help
reflecting
that
after
all
the
doctor
had
not
seen
the
man
with
the
little
wise
eyes
nor
could
he
forget
that
description
of
himself
as
a
coffin
merchant
to
say
the
least
of
it
approached
the
unusual
yet
he
felt
that
it
would
be
intolerable
to
chop
the
whole
business
without
finding
out
what
it
all
meant
on
the
whole
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
have
discovered
the
riddle
at
all
but
having
found
it
he
could
not
rest
without
an
answer
no
gray
inn
road
was
not
like
an
ordinary
undertaker
shop
the
window
was
heavily
draped
with
black
cloth
but
was
otherwise
unadorned
there
were
no
letters
from
grateful
mourners
no
little
model
coffins
no
photographs
of
marble
memorials
even
more
surprising
was
the
absence
of
any
name
over
the
so
that
the
uninformed
stranger
could
not
possibly
tell
what
trade
was
carried
on
within
or
who
was
responsible
for
the
management
of
the
business
this
uncommercial
modesty
did
not
tend
to
remove
doubts
as
to
the
sanity
of
harding
but
he
opened
the
which
started
a
large
bell
swinging
noisily
and
stepped
over
the
threshold
the
shop
was
hardly
more
expressive
inside
than
out
a
broad
counter
ran
across
it
cutting
it
in
two
and
in
the
partial
gloom
overhead
a
naked
whistled
a
noisy
song
beyond
this
the
shop
contained
no
furniture
whatever
and
no
except
a
few
planks
leaning
against
the
wall
in
one
corner
there
was
a
large
on
the
counter
eustace
waited
patiently
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
as
no
one
came
he
began
stamping
on
the
floor
with
his
foot
this
proved
efficacious
for
soon
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
ascending
wooden
stairs
the
door
behind
the
counter
opened
and
a
man
came
into
the
shop
he
was
dressed
quite
neatly
now
and
his
hands
were
no
longer
blue
with
cold
but
eustace
knew
at
once
that
it
was
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
handbill
nevertheless
he
looked
at
eustace
without
a
sign
of
recognition
what
can
i
do
for
you
sir
he
asked
pleasantly
eustace
laid
the
handbill
down
on
the
counter
i
want
to
know
about
this
he
said
it
strikes
me
as
being
in
pretty
bad
taste
and
if
a
nervous
person
got
hold
of
it
it
might
be
dangerous
you
think
so
sir
yet
our
representative
he
lingered
affectionately
on
the
words
our
representative
told
you
i
believe
that
the
handbill
was
only
distributed
to
suitable
cases
that
where
you
are
wrong
said
eustace
sharply
for
i
have
no
one
to
bury
except
yourself
said
the
coffin
merchant
suavely
eustace
looked
at
him
keenly
i
do
see
he
began
but
the
coffin
merchant
interrupted
him
you
must
know
sir
he
said
that
this
is
no
ordinary
business
we
possess
information
that
enables
us
to
defy
competition
in
our
special
class
of
trade
information
well
if
you
prefer
it
you
may
say
intuitions
if
our
representative
handed
you
that
advertisement
it
was
because
he
knew
you
would
need
it
excuse
me
said
eustace
you
appear
to
be
sane
but
your
words
do
not
convey
to
me
any
reasonable
significance
you
gave
me
that
foolish
advertisement
yourself
and
now
you
say
that
you
did
so
because
you
knew
i
would
need
it
i
ask
you
why
the
coffin
merchant
shrugged
his
shoulders
ours
is
a
sentimental
trade
he
said
i
do
not
know
why
dead
men
want
coffins
but
they
do
for
my
part
i
would
wish
to
be
cremated
dead
men
ah
i
was
coming
to
that
you
see
reynolds
thank
you
my
name
is
harding
harding
you
see
reynolds
our
intuitions
are
of
a
very
special
character
and
if
we
say
that
you
will
need
a
coffin
it
is
probable
that
you
will
need
one
you
mean
to
say
that
i
precisely
in
hours
or
less
reynolds
you
will
need
our
services
the
revelation
of
the
coffin
merchant
insanity
came
to
eustace
with
a
certain
relief
for
the
first
time
in
the
interview
he
had
a
sense
of
the
dark
empty
shop
and
the
whistling
over
his
head
why
it
sounds
like
a
threat
mr
harding
he
said
gaily
the
coffin
merchant
looked
at
him
oddly
and
produced
a
printed
form
from
his
pocket
if
you
would
fill
this
up
he
said
eustace
picked
it
up
off
the
counter
and
laughed
aloud
it
was
an
order
for
a
funeral
i
do
know
what
your
game
is
he
said
but
this
has
gone
on
long
enough
perhaps
it
has
reynolds
said
the
coffin
merchant
and
he
leant
across
the
counter
and
looked
eustace
straight
in
the
face
for
a
moment
eustace
was
amused
then
he
was
suddenly
afraid
i
think
it
time
i
he
began
slowly
and
then
he
was
silent
his
whole
will
intent
on
fighting
the
eyes
of
the
coffin
merchant
the
song
of
the
waned
to
a
point
in
his
ears
and
then
rose
steadily
till
it
was
like
the
beating
of
the
world
heart
the
eyes
of
the
coffin
merchant
grew
larger
and
larger
till
they
blended
in
one
great
circle
of
fire
then
eustace
picked
a
pen
off
the
counter
and
filled
in
the
form
thank
you
very
much
reynolds
said
the
coffin
merchant
shaking
hands
with
him
politely
i
can
promise
you
every
civility
and
despatch
sir
outside
on
the
pavement
eustace
stood
for
a
while
trying
to
recall
exactly
what
had
happened
there
was
a
slight
scratch
on
his
hand
and
when
he
automatically
touched
it
with
his
lips
it
made
them
burn
the
lit
lamps
in
the
gray
inn
road
seemed
to
him
a
little
unsteady
and
the
showed
a
disposition
to
blunder
into
him
queer
business
he
said
to
himself
dimly
i
better
have
a
cab
he
reached
home
in
a
dream
it
was
nearly
ten
before
the
doctor
remembered
his
promise
and
went
upstairs
to
eustace
flat
the
outer
door
was
so
that
he
thought
he
was
expected
and
he
switched
on
the
light
in
the
little
hall
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
with
the
simplicity
of
habit
but
when
he
swung
round
from
the
door
he
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment
eustace
was
lying
asleep
in
a
chair
before
him
with
his
face
flushed
and
drooping
on
his
shoulder
and
his
breath
hissing
noisily
through
his
parted
lips
the
doctor
looked
at
him
quizzically
if
i
did
not
know
you
my
young
friend
he
remarked
i
should
say
that
you
were
as
drunk
as
a
lord
and
he
went
up
to
eustace
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
but
eustace
did
not
wake
queer
the
doctor
muttered
sniffing
at
eustace
lips
he
been
drinking
the
soul
of
a
policeman
i
outside
above
the
uneasy
din
of
the
traffic
the
sky
was
glorious
with
the
far
peace
of
a
fine
summer
evening
through
the
upper
pane
of
the
station
window
bennett
who
felt
that
his
senses
at
the
moment
were
abnormally
keen
recognised
with
a
sinking
heart
such
reds
and
yellows
as
bedecked
the
best
patchwork
quilt
at
home
by
contrast
the
lights
of
the
superintendent
office
were
subdued
so
that
within
the
walls
of
the
sounds
seemed
of
greater
importance
somewhere
a
drunkard
deprived
of
his
boots
was
drumming
his
criticism
of
authority
on
the
walls
of
his
cell
from
the
next
room
where
the
men
off
duty
were
amusing
themselves
there
came
a
steady
clicking
of
and
dominoes
broken
now
and
again
by
gruff
bursts
of
laughter
and
at
his
very
elbow
the
superintendent
was
speaking
in
that
suave
voice
that
reminded
bennett
of
grey
velvet
you
see
bennett
how
matters
stand
i
have
nothing
at
all
against
your
conduct
you
are
steady
and
punctual
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
are
trying
to
do
your
duty
but
it
very
unfortunate
that
as
far
as
results
go
you
have
nothing
to
show
for
your
efforts
during
the
last
three
weeks
you
have
not
brought
in
a
charge
of
any
description
and
during
the
same
period
i
find
that
your
colleagues
on
the
beat
have
been
exceptionally
busy
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
accuse
you
of
neglecting
your
duty
but
these
things
tell
with
the
magistrates
and
convey
a
general
suggestion
of
slackness
bennett
looked
down
at
his
brightly
polished
boots
his
fingers
were
sandy
and
there
was
soft
felt
beneath
his
feet
i
have
been
afraid
of
this
for
some
time
sir
he
said
very
much
afraid
the
superintendent
looked
at
him
questioningly
you
have
nothing
to
say
he
said
i
have
always
tried
to
do
my
duty
sir
i
know
i
know
but
you
must
see
that
a
certain
number
of
charges
if
not
of
convictions
is
the
mark
of
a
smart
officer
surely
you
would
not
have
me
arrest
innocent
persons
that
is
a
most
improper
observation
said
the
superintendent
severely
i
will
say
no
more
to
you
now
but
i
hope
you
will
take
what
i
have
said
as
a
warning
you
must
bustle
along
bennett
bustle
along
outside
in
the
street
bennett
was
free
to
reflect
on
his
unpleasant
interview
the
superintendent
was
ambitious
and
therefore
pompous
he
himself
was
unambitious
and
therefore
modest
left
to
himself
he
might
have
been
content
to
triumph
in
the
reflection
that
he
had
failed
to
say
a
number
of
foolish
things
but
the
welfare
of
his
wife
and
children
bound
him
tiresomely
enough
for
a
dreamer
tightly
to
the
practical
it
was
clear
that
if
he
did
not
forthwith
produce
signs
of
his
efficiency
as
a
promoter
of
the
peace
that
welfare
would
be
imperilled
yet
he
did
not
condemn
the
chance
that
had
made
him
a
policeman
or
even
the
mischance
that
brought
no
guilty
persons
to
his
hands
rather
he
looked
with
a
gentle
curiosity
into
the
faces
of
the
people
who
passed
him
and
wondered
why
he
could
not
detect
traces
of
the
generally
assumed
wickedness
of
the
neighbourhood
these
unkempt
men
and
women
were
thieves
and
even
murderers
it
appeared
but
to
him
they
shone
as
happy
youths
and
maidens
joyous
victims
of
love
tyranny
as
he
drew
near
the
street
in
which
he
lived
this
sense
of
universal
love
quickened
in
his
blood
and
stirred
him
strangely
it
did
not
escape
his
eyes
that
to
the
general
his
uniform
was
an
unfriendly
thing
men
and
women
paused
in
their
animated
chattering
till
he
had
passed
and
even
the
children
faltered
in
their
games
to
watch
him
with
doubtful
eyes
and
yet
his
heart
was
warm
for
them
he
knew
that
he
wished
them
well
nevertheless
when
he
saw
his
house
shining
in
a
row
of
similar
houses
he
realised
that
their
attitude
was
wiser
than
his
if
he
was
to
be
a
success
as
a
breadwinner
he
must
wage
a
sterner
war
against
these
happy
lovable
people
it
was
easy
he
had
been
long
enough
in
the
force
to
know
how
easy
to
get
cases
an
intolerant
manner
a
little
provocative
harshness
and
the
thing
was
done
yet
with
all
his
heart
he
admired
the
poor
for
their
resentful
independence
of
spirit
to
him
this
had
always
been
the
supreme
quality
of
the
english
character
how
could
he
make
use
of
it
to
fill
english
gaols
he
opened
the
door
of
his
house
with
a
sigh
on
his
lips
there
came
forth
the
merry
shouting
of
his
children
ii
above
the
telephone
wires
the
stars
dipped
at
anchor
in
the
cloudless
sky
down
below
in
one
of
the
dark
empty
streets
bennett
turned
the
handles
of
doors
and
tested
the
fastenings
of
windows
with
a
complete
scepticism
as
to
the
value
of
his
labours
gradually
he
was
coming
to
see
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
few
who
are
born
to
rule
to
control
their
simple
neighbours
ambitious
only
for
breath
where
if
he
had
possessed
this
mission
he
would
have
been
eager
to
punish
he
now
felt
no
more
than
a
sympathy
that
charged
him
with
some
responsibility
for
the
sins
of
others
he
shared
the
uneasy
conviction
of
the
multitude
that
human
justice
as
interpreted
by
the
inspired
minority
is
more
than
a
little
unjust
the
very
unpopularity
with
which
his
uniform
endowed
him
seemed
to
him
to
express
a
severe
criticism
of
the
system
of
which
he
was
an
unwilling
supporter
he
wished
these
people
to
regard
him
as
a
kind
of
official
friend
to
advise
and
settle
differences
yet
shrewder
than
he
they
considered
him
as
an
enemy
who
lived
on
their
mistakes
and
the
collapse
of
their
social
relationships
there
remained
his
duty
to
his
wife
and
children
and
this
rendered
the
problem
infinitely
perplexing
why
should
he
punish
others
because
of
his
love
for
his
children
or
again
why
should
his
children
suffer
for
his
scruples
yet
it
was
clear
that
unless
fortune
permitted
him
to
accomplish
some
notable
yet
honourable
arrest
he
would
either
have
to
cheat
and
tyrannise
with
his
colleagues
or
leave
the
force
and
what
employment
is
available
for
a
discharged
policeman
as
he
went
systematically
from
house
to
house
the
consideration
of
these
things
marred
the
normal
progress
of
his
dreams
conscious
as
he
was
of
the
stars
and
the
great
widths
of
heaven
that
made
the
world
so
small
he
nevertheless
felt
that
his
love
for
his
family
and
the
wider
love
that
determined
his
honour
were
somehow
intimately
connected
with
this
greatness
of
the
universe
rather
than
with
the
world
of
little
streets
and
little
motives
and
so
were
not
lightly
to
be
put
aside
yet
how
can
one
measure
one
love
against
another
when
all
are
true
when
the
door
of
gurneys
the
moneylenders
opened
to
his
touch
and
drew
him
abruptly
from
his
speculations
his
first
emotion
was
a
quick
irritation
that
chance
should
interfere
with
his
thoughts
but
when
his
lantern
showed
him
that
the
lock
had
been
tampered
with
his
annoyance
changed
to
a
thrill
of
hopeful
excitement
what
if
this
were
the
way
out
what
if
fate
had
granted
him
compromise
the
opportunity
of
pitting
his
official
virtue
against
official
crime
those
shadowy
forces
in
the
existence
of
which
he
did
not
believe
but
which
lay
on
his
life
like
clouds
he
was
not
a
physical
coward
and
it
seemed
quite
simple
to
him
to
creep
quietly
through
the
open
door
into
the
silent
office
without
waiting
for
possible
reinforcements
he
knew
that
the
safe
which
would
be
the
natural
goal
of
the
presumed
burglars
was
in
gurney
private
office
beyond
and
while
he
stood
listening
intently
he
seemed
to
hear
dim
sounds
coming
from
the
direction
of
that
room
for
a
moment
he
paused
frowning
slightly
as
a
man
does
when
he
is
trying
to
catalogue
an
impression
when
he
achieved
perception
it
came
oddly
mingled
with
recollections
of
the
little
tragedies
of
his
children
at
home
for
some
one
was
crying
like
a
child
in
the
little
room
where
gurney
recalcitrant
borrowers
dangerous
burglars
do
not
weep
and
bennett
hesitated
no
longer
but
stepped
past
the
open
flaps
of
the
counter
and
threw
open
the
door
of
the
inner
office
the
electric
light
had
been
switched
on
and
at
the
table
there
sat
a
slight
young
man
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
crying
bitterly
behind
him
the
safe
stood
open
and
empty
and
the
grate
was
filled
with
smouldering
embers
of
burnt
paper
bennett
went
up
to
the
young
man
and
placed
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
the
young
man
wept
on
and
did
not
move
try
as
he
might
bennett
could
not
help
relaxing
the
grip
of
outraged
law
and
patting
the
young
man
shoulder
soothingly
as
it
rose
and
fell
he
had
no
fit
weapons
of
roughness
and
oppression
with
which
to
oppose
this
grief
he
could
only
fight
tears
with
tears
come
he
said
gently
you
must
pull
yourself
together
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
young
man
gave
a
great
sob
and
then
was
silent
shivering
a
little
that
better
said
bennett
encouragingly
much
better
i
have
burnt
everything
the
young
man
said
suddenly
and
now
the
place
is
empty
i
was
nearly
sick
just
now
bennett
looked
at
him
sympathetically
as
one
dreamer
may
look
at
another
who
is
sad
with
action
dreamed
too
often
for
scatheless
accomplishment
i
afraid
you
get
into
serious
trouble
he
said
i
know
replied
the
young
man
but
that
blackguard
gurney
his
voice
rose
to
a
shrill
scream
and
choked
him
for
a
moment
then
he
went
on
quietly
but
it
all
over
now
finished
done
with
i
suppose
you
owed
him
money
the
young
man
nodded
he
lives
on
fools
like
me
but
he
threatened
to
tell
my
father
and
now
i
just
about
ruined
him
pah
swine
this
wo
be
much
better
for
your
father
said
bennett
gravely
no
it
worse
but
perhaps
it
will
help
some
of
the
others
he
kept
on
threatening
and
i
could
wait
any
longer
ca
you
see
over
the
young
man
shoulder
the
stars
becked
and
nodded
to
bennett
through
the
blindless
window
i
see
he
said
i
see
so
now
you
can
take
me
bennett
looked
doubtfully
at
the
outstretched
wrists
you
are
only
a
fool
he
said
a
dreaming
fool
like
me
and
they
will
give
you
years
for
this
i
do
see
why
they
should
give
a
man
years
for
being
a
fool
the
young
man
looked
up
taken
with
a
sudden
hope
you
will
let
me
go
he
said
in
astonishment
i
know
i
was
an
ass
just
now
i
suppose
i
was
a
bit
shaken
but
you
will
let
me
go
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
seen
you
said
bennett
simply
you
have
your
father
and
i
have
a
wife
and
three
little
children
who
shall
judge
between
us
my
father
is
an
old
man
and
my
children
are
little
you
had
better
go
before
i
make
up
my
mind
without
another
word
the
young
man
crept
out
of
the
room
and
bennett
followed
him
slowly
into
the
street
this
gallant
criminal
whose
capture
would
have
been
honourable
had
dwindled
to
a
hysterical
foolish
boy
and
aided
by
his
own
strange
impulse
this
boy
had
ruined
him
the
burglary
had
taken
place
on
his
beat
there
would
be
an
inquiry
it
did
not
need
that
to
secure
his
expulsion
from
the
force
once
in
the
street
he
looked
up
hopefully
to
the
heavens
but
now
the
stars
seemed
unspeakably
remote
though
as
he
passed
along
his
beat
his
wife
and
his
three
little
children
were
walking
by
his
side
iii
bennett
had
developed
mentally
without
realising
the
logical
result
of
his
development
until
it
smote
him
with
calamity
of
his
betrayal
of
trust
as
a
guardian
of
property
he
thought
nothing
of
the
possibility
of
poverty
for
his
family
he
thought
a
great
deal
all
the
more
that
his
dreamer
mind
was
little
accustomed
to
gripping
the
practical
it
was
strange
he
thought
that
his
final
declaration
of
war
against
his
position
should
have
been
a
little
lacking
in
dignity
he
had
not
taken
the
decisive
step
through
any
deep
compassion
of
utter
poverty
bravely
borne
his
had
been
no
more
than
trivial
pity
of
a
young
man
folly
and
this
was
a
frail
thing
on
which
to
make
so
great
a
sacrifice
yet
he
regretted
nothing
his
task
of
moral
guardian
of
men
and
women
had
become
impossible
to
him
and
sooner
or
later
he
must
have
given
it
up
and
there
was
also
his
family
i
must
come
to
some
decision
he
said
to
himself
firmly
and
then
the
great
scream
fell
upon
his
ears
and
echoed
through
his
brain
for
ever
and
ever
it
came
from
the
house
before
which
he
was
standing
and
he
expected
the
whole
street
to
wake
aghast
with
the
horror
of
it
but
there
followed
a
silence
that
seemed
to
emphasise
the
ugliness
of
the
sound
far
away
an
engine
screamed
as
if
in
mocking
imitation
and
that
was
all
bennett
had
counted
up
to
a
hundred
and
seventy
before
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
a
man
came
out
on
to
the
steps
oh
constable
he
said
coolly
come
inside
will
you
i
have
something
to
show
you
bennett
mounted
the
steps
doubtfully
there
was
a
scream
he
said
the
man
looked
at
him
quickly
so
you
heard
it
he
said
it
was
not
pretty
no
it
was
not
replied
bennett
the
man
led
him
down
the
dim
passage
into
the
back
the
body
of
a
man
lay
on
the
sofa
it
was
curled
like
a
dry
leaf
that
is
my
brother
said
the
man
with
a
little
emphatic
nod
i
have
killed
him
he
was
my
enemy
bennett
stared
dully
at
the
body
without
believing
it
to
be
really
there
dead
he
said
mechanically
and
anything
i
say
will
be
used
against
me
in
evidence
as
if
you
could
compress
my
hatred
into
one
little
lying
notebook
i
do
care
a
damn
about
your
hatred
said
bennett
with
heat
an
hour
ago
perhaps
i
might
have
arrested
you
now
i
only
find
you
uninteresting
the
man
gave
a
long
low
whistle
of
surprise
a
philosopher
in
uniform
he
said
god
sir
you
have
my
sympathy
and
you
have
my
pity
you
have
stolen
your
ideas
from
cheap
melodrama
and
you
make
tragedy
ridiculous
were
i
a
policeman
i
would
lock
you
up
with
pleasure
were
i
a
man
i
should
thrash
you
joyfully
as
it
is
i
can
only
share
your
infamy
i
too
i
suppose
am
a
murderer
you
are
in
a
low
nervous
state
said
the
man
and
you
are
doing
me
some
injustice
it
is
true
that
i
am
a
poor
murderer
but
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
a
worse
policeman
i
shall
wear
the
uniform
no
more
from
tonight
i
think
you
are
wise
and
i
shall
mar
my
philosophy
with
no
more
murders
if
indeed
i
have
killed
him
for
i
assure
you
that
beyond
administering
the
poison
to
his
wretched
body
i
have
done
nothing
perhaps
he
is
not
dead
can
you
hear
his
heart
beating
i
can
hear
the
spoons
of
my
children
beating
on
their
empty
platters
is
it
like
that
with
you
poor
devil
oh
poor
poor
devil
philosophers
should
have
no
wives
no
children
no
homes
and
no
hearts
bennett
turned
from
the
man
with
unspeakable
loathing
i
hate
you
and
such
as
you
he
cried
weakly
you
justify
the
existence
of
the
police
you
make
me
despise
myself
because
i
realise
that
your
crimes
are
no
less
mine
than
yours
i
do
not
ask
you
to
defend
the
deadness
of
that
thing
lying
there
i
shall
stir
no
finger
to
have
you
hanged
for
the
thought
of
suicide
repels
me
and
i
can
not
separate
your
blood
and
mine
we
are
common
children
of
a
noble
mother
and
for
our
mother
sake
i
say
farewell
and
without
waiting
for
the
man
answer
he
passed
from
the
house
to
the
street
iv
haggard
and
with
rebellious
limbs
bennett
staggered
into
the
superintendent
office
in
the
early
morning
i
have
paid
careful
attention
to
your
advice
he
said
to
the
superintendent
and
i
have
passed
across
the
city
in
search
of
crime
in
its
place
i
have
found
but
folly
such
folly
as
you
have
such
folly
as
i
have
myself
the
common
heritage
of
our
blood
it
seems
that
in
some
way
i
have
bound
myself
to
bring
criminals
to
justice
i
have
passed
across
the
city
and
i
have
found
no
man
worse
than
myself
do
what
you
will
with
me
the
superintendent
cleared
his
throat
there
have
been
too
many
complaints
concerning
the
conduct
of
the
police
he
said
it
is
time
that
an
example
was
made
you
will
be
charged
with
being
drunk
and
disorderly
while
on
duty
i
have
a
wife
and
three
little
children
said
bennett
softly
and
three
pretty
little
children
and
he
covered
his
tired
face
with
his
hands
the
conjurer
certainly
the
audience
was
restive
in
the
first
place
it
felt
that
it
had
been
defrauded
seeing
that
cissie
bradford
whose
smiling
face
adorned
the
bills
outside
had
failed
to
appear
and
secondly
it
considered
that
the
deputy
for
that
famous
lady
was
more
than
inadequate
to
the
little
man
who
sweated
in
the
glare
of
the
limelight
and
juggled
desperately
with
glass
balls
in
a
vain
effort
to
steady
his
nerve
it
was
apparent
that
his
turn
was
a
failure
and
as
he
worked
he
could
have
cried
with
disappointment
for
his
was
a
trial
performance
and
a
year
engagement
in
the
hennings
group
of
would
have
rewarded
success
yet
his
tricks
things
that
he
had
done
with
the
utmost
ease
a
thousand
times
had
been
a
succession
of
blunders
rather
than
mystifying
to
the
audience
presently
one
of
the
glass
balls
fell
crashing
on
the
stage
and
amidst
the
jeers
of
the
gallery
he
turned
to
his
wife
who
served
as
his
assistant
i
lost
my
chance
he
said
with
a
sob
i
ca
do
it
never
mind
dear
she
whispered
there
a
nice
steak
and
onions
at
home
for
supper
it
no
use
he
said
despairingly
i
try
the
disappearing
trick
and
then
get
off
i
done
here
he
turned
back
to
the
audience
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
to
the
mockers
in
a
wavering
voice
i
will
now
present
to
you
the
concluding
item
of
my
entertainment
i
will
cause
this
lady
to
disappear
under
your
very
eyes
without
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
contrivance
or
artificial
device
this
was
the
merest
showman
patter
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
not
a
very
wonderful
illusion
but
as
he
led
his
wife
forward
to
present
her
to
the
audience
the
conjurer
was
wondering
whether
the
mishaps
that
had
ruined
his
chance
would
meet
him
even
here
if
something
should
go
wrong
he
felt
his
wife
hand
tremble
in
his
and
he
pressed
it
tightly
to
reassure
her
he
must
make
an
effort
an
effort
of
will
and
then
no
mistakes
would
happen
for
a
second
the
lights
danced
before
his
eyes
then
he
pulled
himself
together
if
an
earthquake
should
disturb
the
curtains
and
show
molly
creeping
ignominiously
away
behind
he
would
still
meet
his
fate
like
a
man
he
turned
round
to
conduct
his
wife
to
the
little
alcove
from
which
she
should
vanish
she
was
not
on
the
stage
for
a
minute
he
did
not
guess
the
greatness
of
the
disaster
then
he
realised
that
the
theatre
was
intensely
quiet
and
that
he
would
have
to
explain
that
the
last
item
of
his
programme
was
even
more
of
a
fiasco
than
the
rest
owing
to
a
sudden
indisposition
his
skin
tingled
at
the
thought
of
the
hooting
his
tongue
rasped
upon
cracking
lips
as
he
braced
himself
and
bowed
to
the
audience
then
came
the
applause
again
and
again
it
broke
out
from
all
over
the
house
while
the
curtain
rose
and
fell
and
the
conjurer
stood
on
the
stage
mute
uncomprehending
what
had
happened
at
first
he
had
thought
they
were
mocking
him
but
it
was
impossible
to
misjudge
the
nature
of
the
applause
besides
the
was
allowing
him
call
after
call
as
if
he
were
a
star
when
at
length
the
curtain
remained
down
and
the
orchestra
struck
up
the
opening
bars
of
the
next
song
he
staggered
off
into
the
wings
as
if
he
were
drunk
there
he
met
james
hennings
himself
you
do
said
the
great
man
that
last
trick
was
neat
you
ought
to
polish
up
the
others
though
i
suppose
you
do
want
to
tell
me
how
you
did
it
well
well
come
in
the
morning
and
we
fix
up
a
contract
and
so
without
having
said
a
word
the
conjurer
found
himself
hustled
off
by
the
vaudeville
napoleon
hennings
had
something
more
to
say
to
his
manager
bit
rum
he
said
did
you
see
it
queerest
thing
we
struck
how
was
it
done
do
you
think
ca
imagine
there
one
minute
on
his
arm
gone
the
next
no
trap
or
curtain
or
anything
money
in
it
eh
biggest
hit
of
the
century
i
should
think
i
go
and
fix
up
a
contract
and
get
him
to
sign
it
tonight
get
on
with
it
and
james
hennings
fled
to
his
office
meanwhile
the
conjurer
was
wandering
in
the
wings
with
the
drooping
heart
of
a
lost
child
what
had
happened
why
was
he
a
success
and
why
did
people
stare
so
oddly
and
what
had
become
of
his
wife
when
he
asked
them
the
stage
hands
laughed
and
said
they
had
not
seen
her
why
should
they
laugh
he
wanted
her
to
explain
things
and
hear
their
good
luck
but
she
was
not
in
her
she
was
not
anywhere
for
a
moment
he
felt
like
crying
then
for
the
second
time
that
night
he
pulled
himself
together
after
all
there
was
no
reason
to
be
upset
he
ought
to
feel
very
pleased
about
the
contract
however
it
had
happened
it
seemed
that
his
wife
had
left
the
stage
in
some
queer
way
without
being
seen
probably
to
increase
the
mystery
she
had
gone
straight
home
in
her
stage
dress
and
had
succeeded
in
dodging
the
keeper
it
was
all
very
strange
but
of
course
there
must
be
some
simple
explanation
like
that
he
would
take
a
cab
home
and
find
her
there
already
there
was
a
steak
and
onions
for
supper
as
he
drove
along
in
the
cab
he
became
convinced
that
this
theory
was
right
molly
had
always
been
clever
and
this
time
she
had
certainly
succeeded
in
surprising
everybody
at
the
door
of
his
house
he
gave
the
cabman
a
shilling
for
himself
with
a
light
heart
he
could
afford
it
now
he
ran
up
the
steps
cheerfully
and
opened
the
door
the
passage
was
quite
dark
and
he
wondered
why
his
wife
had
lit
the
gas
molly
he
cried
molly
the
small
servant
came
out
of
the
kitchen
on
a
savoury
wind
of
onions
has
missus
come
home
with
you
sir
she
said
the
conjurer
thrust
his
hand
against
the
wall
to
steady
himself
and
the
pattern
of
the
seemed
to
burn
his
not
here
he
gasped
at
the
frightened
girl
then
where
is
she
where
is
she
i
do
know
sir
she
began
stuttering
but
the
conjurer
turned
quickly
and
ran
out
of
the
house
of
course
his
wife
must
be
at
the
theatre
it
was
absurd
ever
to
have
supposed
that
she
could
leave
the
theatre
in
her
stage
dress
unnoticed
and
now
she
was
probably
worrying
because
he
had
not
waited
for
her
how
foolish
he
had
been
it
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
found
a
cab
and
the
theatre
was
dark
and
empty
when
he
got
back
to
it
he
knocked
at
the
stage
door
and
the
night
watchman
opened
it
my
wife
he
cried
there
no
one
here
now
sir
the
man
answered
respectfully
for
he
knew
that
a
new
star
had
risen
that
night
the
conjurer
leant
against
the
doorpost
faintly
take
me
up
to
the
he
said
i
want
to
see
whether
she
has
been
there
while
i
was
away
the
watchman
led
the
way
along
the
dark
passages
i
should
worry
if
i
were
you
sir
he
said
she
ca
have
gone
far
he
did
not
know
anything
about
it
but
he
wanted
to
be
sympathetic
god
knows
the
conjurer
muttered
i
ca
understand
this
at
all
in
the
molly
clothes
still
lay
neatly
folded
as
she
had
left
them
when
they
went
on
the
stage
that
night
and
when
he
saw
them
his
last
hope
left
the
conjurer
and
a
strange
thought
came
into
his
mind
i
should
like
to
go
down
on
the
stage
he
said
and
see
if
there
is
anything
to
tell
me
of
her
the
night
watchman
looked
at
the
conjurer
as
if
he
thought
he
was
mad
but
he
followed
him
down
to
the
stage
in
silence
when
he
was
there
the
conjurer
leaned
forward
suddenly
and
his
face
was
filled
with
a
wistful
eagerness
molly
he
called
molly
but
the
empty
theatre
gave
him
nothing
but
echoes
in
reply
the
poet
allegory
i
the
boy
came
into
the
town
at
six
in
the
morning
but
the
baker
at
the
corner
of
the
first
street
was
up
as
is
the
way
of
bakers
and
when
he
saw
the
boy
passing
he
hailed
him
with
a
jolly
shout
hullo
boy
what
are
you
after
i
going
about
my
business
the
boy
said
pertly
and
what
might
that
be
young
fellow
i
might
be
a
good
tinker
and
worship
god
pan
or
i
might
grind
scissors
as
sharp
as
the
noses
of
bakers
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
a
piper
not
a
you
understand
but
just
a
simple
singer
of
sad
songs
and
a
mad
singer
of
merry
ones
oh
said
the
baker
dully
for
he
had
hoped
the
boy
was
in
search
of
work
then
i
suppose
you
have
a
message
i
sing
songs
the
boy
said
emphatically
i
do
run
errands
for
anyone
save
it
be
for
the
fairies
well
then
you
have
come
to
tell
us
that
we
are
bad
that
our
lives
are
corrupt
and
our
homes
sordid
nowadays
there
money
in
that
if
you
can
do
it
well
your
wit
gets
up
too
early
in
the
morning
for
me
baker
said
the
boy
i
tell
you
i
sing
songs
aye
i
know
but
there
something
in
them
i
hope
perhaps
you
bring
news
they
not
so
popular
as
the
other
sort
but
still
as
long
as
it
bad
news
is
it
the
flour
that
has
changed
his
brains
to
dough
or
the
heat
of
the
oven
that
has
made
them
like
dead
grass
but
you
must
have
some
news
news
it
a
fine
morning
of
summer
and
i
saw
a
kingfisher
across
the
watermeadows
coming
along
oh
and
there
a
cuckoo
back
in
the
fir
plantation
singing
with
a
may
voice
it
must
have
been
asleep
all
these
months
but
my
dear
boy
these
things
happen
every
day
are
there
no
battles
or
earthquakes
or
famines
in
the
world
has
no
man
murdered
his
wife
or
robbed
his
neighbour
is
no
one
oppressed
by
tyrants
or
lied
to
by
their
officers
the
boy
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
hope
not
he
said
but
if
it
were
so
and
i
knew
i
should
not
tell
you
i
do
want
to
make
you
unhappy
but
of
what
use
are
you
then
if
it
be
not
to
rouse
in
us
the
discontent
that
is
alone
divine
would
you
have
me
go
fat
and
happy
listening
to
your
babble
of
kingfishers
and
cuckoos
while
my
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
world
are
starving
the
boy
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
give
my
songs
to
the
poor
for
nothing
he
said
slowly
certainly
they
are
not
much
use
to
empty
bellies
but
they
are
all
i
have
to
give
and
i
take
it
since
you
speak
so
feelingly
that
you
too
do
your
best
and
these
others
these
people
who
must
be
reminded
hourly
to
throw
their
crusts
out
of
window
for
the
poor
would
you
have
me
sing
to
them
they
must
be
told
that
life
is
evil
and
i
find
it
good
that
men
and
women
are
wretched
and
i
find
them
happy
that
food
and
cleanliness
order
and
knowledge
are
the
essence
of
content
while
i
only
ask
for
love
would
you
have
me
lie
to
cheat
mean
folk
out
of
their
scraps
the
baker
scratched
his
head
in
astonishment
certainly
you
are
very
mad
he
said
but
you
wo
get
much
money
in
this
town
with
that
sort
of
talk
you
had
better
come
in
and
have
breakfast
with
me
but
why
do
you
ask
me
said
the
boy
in
surprise
well
you
have
a
decent
honest
sort
of
face
although
your
tongue
is
disordered
i
had
rather
it
had
been
because
you
liked
my
songs
said
the
boy
and
he
went
in
to
breakfast
with
the
baker
ii
over
his
breakfast
the
boy
talked
wisely
on
art
as
is
the
wont
of
young
singers
and
afterwards
he
went
on
his
way
down
the
street
it
a
great
pity
said
the
baker
he
seems
a
decent
young
chap
he
has
nice
eyes
said
the
baker
wife
as
the
boy
passed
down
the
street
he
frowned
a
little
what
is
the
matter
with
them
he
wondered
they
pleasant
people
enough
and
yet
they
did
not
want
to
hear
my
songs
presently
he
came
to
the
tailor
shop
and
as
the
tailor
had
sharper
eyes
than
the
baker
he
saw
the
pipe
in
the
boy
pocket
hullo
piper
he
called
my
legs
are
stiff
come
and
sing
us
a
song
the
boy
looked
up
and
saw
the
tailor
sitting
in
the
open
window
of
his
shop
what
sort
of
song
would
you
like
he
asked
oh
the
latest
replied
the
tailor
we
do
want
any
old
songs
here
so
the
boy
sung
his
new
song
of
the
kingfisher
in
the
and
the
cuckoo
who
had
overslept
itself
and
what
do
you
call
that
asked
the
tailor
angrily
when
the
boy
had
finished
it
my
new
song
but
i
do
think
it
one
of
my
best
but
in
his
heart
the
boy
believed
it
was
because
he
had
only
just
made
it
i
should
hope
it
your
worst
the
tailor
said
rudely
what
sort
of
stuff
is
that
to
make
a
man
happy
to
make
a
man
happy
echoed
the
boy
his
heart
sinking
within
him
if
you
have
no
news
to
give
me
why
should
i
pay
for
your
songs
i
want
to
hear
about
my
neighbours
about
their
lives
and
their
wives
and
their
sins
there
the
fat
baker
up
the
street
they
say
he
cheats
the
poor
with
light
bread
make
me
a
song
of
that
and
give
you
some
breakfast
or
there
the
magistrate
at
the
top
of
the
hill
who
made
the
girl
drown
herself
last
week
that
a
poetic
subject
what
all
this
said
the
boy
disdainfully
ca
you
make
dirt
enough
for
yourself
you
with
your
stuff
about
birds
shouted
the
tailor
you
a
rank
impostor
that
what
you
are
they
say
that
you
are
the
ninth
part
of
a
man
but
i
find
that
they
have
grossly
exaggerated
cried
the
boy
in
retort
but
he
had
a
heavy
heart
as
he
made
off
along
the
street
by
noon
he
had
interviewed
the
butcher
the
cobbler
the
milkman
and
the
maker
of
candlesticks
but
they
treated
him
no
better
than
the
tailor
had
done
and
as
he
was
feeling
tired
he
went
and
sat
down
under
a
tree
i
begin
to
think
that
the
baker
is
the
best
of
the
lot
of
them
he
said
to
himself
ruefully
as
he
rolled
his
empty
wallet
between
his
fingers
then
as
the
folly
of
singers
provides
them
in
some
measure
with
a
philosophy
he
fell
asleep
iii
when
he
woke
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
children
fresh
from
school
had
come
out
to
play
in
the
dusk
far
and
near
across
the
the
boy
could
hear
their
merry
voices
but
he
felt
sad
for
his
stomach
had
forgotten
the
baker
breakfast
and
he
did
not
see
where
he
was
likely
to
get
any
supper
so
he
pulled
out
his
pipe
and
made
a
mournful
song
to
himself
of
the
dancing
gnats
and
the
bitter
odour
of
the
bonfires
in
the
townsfolk
gardens
and
the
children
drew
near
to
hear
him
sing
for
they
thought
his
song
was
pretty
until
their
fathers
drove
them
home
saying
that
stuff
has
no
educational
value
why
have
you
a
message
they
asked
the
boy
i
come
to
tell
you
that
the
grass
is
green
beneath
your
feet
and
that
the
sky
is
blue
over
your
heads
oh
i
but
we
know
all
that
they
answered
do
you
do
you
screamed
the
boy
do
you
think
you
could
stop
over
your
absurd
labours
if
you
knew
how
blue
the
sky
is
you
would
be
out
singing
on
the
hills
with
me
then
who
would
do
our
work
they
said
mocking
him
then
who
would
want
it
done
he
retorted
but
it
ill
arguing
on
an
empty
stomach
but
when
they
had
tired
of
telling
him
what
a
fool
he
was
and
gone
away
the
tailor
little
daughter
crept
out
of
the
shadows
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
i
say
boy
she
whispered
i
brought
you
some
supper
father
does
know
the
boy
blessed
her
and
ate
his
supper
while
she
watched
him
like
his
mother
and
when
he
had
done
she
kissed
him
on
the
lips
there
boy
she
said
you
have
nice
golden
hair
the
boy
said
see
it
shines
in
the
dusk
it
strikes
me
it
the
only
gold
i
shall
get
in
this
town
still
it
nice
do
you
think
the
girl
whispered
in
his
ear
she
had
her
arms
round
his
neck
i
love
it
the
boy
said
joyfully
and
you
like
my
songs
you
oh
yes
i
like
them
very
much
but
i
like
you
better
the
boy
put
her
off
roughly
you
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
them
he
said
indignantly
i
tell
you
my
songs
are
everything
i
am
nothing
but
it
was
you
who
ate
my
supper
boy
said
the
girl
the
boy
kissed
her
remorsefully
but
i
wish
you
had
liked
me
for
my
songs
he
sighed
you
are
better
than
any
silly
old
songs
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
them
the
boy
said
lazily
but
somehow
pleasant
the
shadows
flocked
to
their
evening
meeting
in
the
square
and
overhead
the
stars
shone
out
in
a
sky
that
was
certainly
exceedingly
blue
iv
next
morning
they
arrested
the
boy
as
a
rogue
and
a
vagabond
and
in
the
afternoon
they
brought
him
before
the
magistrate
and
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
said
the
magistrate
to
the
boy
after
the
second
policeman
like
a
faithful
echo
had
finished
reading
his
notes
well
said
the
boy
i
may
be
a
rogue
and
a
vagabond
indeed
i
think
that
i
probably
am
but
i
would
claim
the
license
that
has
always
been
allowed
to
singers
oh
said
the
magistrate
so
you
are
one
of
those
are
you
and
what
is
your
message
i
think
if
i
could
sing
you
a
song
or
two
i
could
explain
myself
better
said
the
boy
well
replied
the
magistrate
doubtfully
you
can
try
if
you
like
but
i
warn
you
that
i
wrote
songs
myself
when
i
was
a
boy
so
that
i
know
something
about
it
oh
i
glad
of
that
said
the
boy
and
he
sang
his
famous
song
of
the
grass
that
is
so
green
and
when
he
had
finished
the
magistrate
frowned
i
knew
that
before
he
said
so
then
the
boy
sang
his
wonderful
song
of
the
sky
that
is
so
blue
and
when
he
had
finished
the
magistrate
scowled
and
what
are
we
to
learn
from
that
he
said
so
then
the
boy
lost
his
temper
and
sang
some
naughty
doggerel
he
had
made
up
in
his
cell
that
morning
he
abused
the
town
and
townsmen
but
especially
the
townsmen
he
damned
their
morals
their
customs
and
their
institutions
he
said
that
they
had
ugly
faces
raucous
voices
and
that
their
bodies
were
unclean
he
said
they
were
thieves
and
liars
and
murderers
that
they
had
no
ear
for
music
and
no
sense
of
humour
oh
he
was
bitter
good
god
said
the
magistrate
that
what
i
call
real
improving
poetry
why
did
you
sing
that
first
there
might
have
been
a
miscarriage
of
justice
then
the
baker
the
tailor
the
butcher
the
cobbler
the
milkman
and
the
maker
of
candlesticks
rose
in
court
and
said
ah
but
we
all
knew
there
was
something
in
him
so
the
magistrate
gave
the
boy
a
certificate
that
showed
that
he
was
a
real
singer
and
the
tradesmen
gave
him
a
purse
of
gold
but
the
tailor
little
daughter
gave
him
one
of
her
golden
ringlets
you
wo
forget
boy
will
you
she
said
oh
no
said
the
boy
but
i
wish
you
had
liked
my
songs
presently
when
he
had
come
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
he
put
his
hand
in
his
wallet
and
drew
out
the
magistrate
certificate
and
tore
it
in
two
and
then
he
took
out
the
gold
pieces
and
threw
them
into
the
ditch
and
they
were
not
half
as
bright
as
the
buttercups
but
when
he
came
to
the
ringlet
he
smiled
at
it
and
put
it
back
yet
she
was
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
them
he
thought
with
a
sigh
and
he
went
across
the
world
with
his
songs
and
who
shall
say
it
was
a
dull
november
day
and
the
windows
were
heavily
curtained
so
that
the
room
was
very
dark
in
front
of
the
fire
was
a
large
which
shut
whatever
light
there
might
be
from
the
two
children
a
boy
of
eleven
and
a
girl
about
two
years
younger
who
sat
on
the
floor
at
the
back
of
the
room
the
boy
was
the
better
looking
but
the
girl
had
the
better
face
they
were
both
gazing
at
the
with
the
utmost
excitement
it
all
right
he
asleep
said
the
boy
oh
do
be
careful
you
wake
him
whispered
the
girl
are
you
afraid
no
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
my
father
stupid
i
tell
you
he
not
father
any
more
he
a
murderer
the
boy
said
hotly
he
told
me
i
tell
you
he
said
have
killed
your
mother
ray
and
i
went
and
looked
and
mother
was
all
red
i
simply
shouted
and
she
would
answer
that
means
she
dead
his
hand
was
all
red
too
was
it
paint
no
of
course
it
was
paint
it
was
blood
and
then
he
came
down
here
and
went
to
sleep
poor
father
so
tired
he
not
poor
father
he
not
father
at
all
he
a
murderer
and
it
is
very
wicked
of
you
to
call
him
father
said
the
boy
father
muttered
the
girl
rebelliously
you
know
the
sixth
commandment
says
shalt
do
no
murder
and
he
has
done
murder
so
he
go
to
hell
and
you
go
to
hell
too
if
you
call
him
father
it
all
in
the
bible
the
boy
ended
vaguely
but
the
little
girl
was
quite
overcome
by
the
thought
of
her
badness
oh
i
am
wicked
she
cried
and
i
do
so
want
to
go
to
heaven
she
had
a
stout
and
materialistic
belief
in
it
as
a
place
of
sheeted
angels
and
harps
where
it
was
easy
to
be
good
you
must
do
as
i
tell
you
then
he
said
because
i
know
learnt
all
about
it
at
school
and
you
never
told
me
said
she
reproachfully
ah
there
lots
of
things
i
know
he
replied
nodding
his
head
what
must
we
do
said
the
girl
meekly
shall
i
go
and
ask
mother
the
boy
was
sick
at
her
obstinacy
mother
dead
i
tell
you
that
means
she
ca
hear
anything
no
use
talking
to
her
but
i
know
you
must
stop
here
and
if
father
wakes
you
run
out
of
the
house
and
call
and
i
will
go
now
and
tell
a
policeman
now
and
what
happens
then
she
asked
with
round
eyes
at
her
wisdom
oh
they
come
and
take
him
away
to
prison
and
then
they
put
a
rope
round
his
neck
and
hang
him
like
haman
and
he
goes
to
hell
do
they
kill
him
because
he
a
murderer
they
always
do
oh
do
let
tell
them
do
let
tell
them
she
screamed
shut
up
said
the
boy
or
he
wake
up
we
must
tell
them
or
we
go
to
hell
both
of
us
but
his
sister
did
not
collapse
at
this
awful
threat
as
he
expected
though
the
tears
were
rolling
down
her
face
do
let
tell
them
she
sobbed
you
a
horrid
girl
and
you
go
to
hell
said
the
boy
in
disgust
but
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
her
sobbing
i
tell
you
he
killed
mother
dead
you
did
cry
a
bit
for
mother
i
did
oh
let
ask
mother
let
ask
mother
i
know
she
wo
want
father
to
go
to
hell
let
ask
mother
mother
dead
and
ca
hear
you
stupid
said
the
boy
i
keep
on
telling
you
come
up
and
look
they
were
both
a
little
awed
in
mother
room
it
was
so
quiet
and
mother
looked
so
funny
and
first
the
girl
shouted
and
then
the
boy
and
then
they
shouted
both
together
but
nothing
happened
the
echoes
made
them
frightened
perhaps
she
asleep
the
girl
said
so
her
brother
pinched
one
of
mother
hands
the
white
one
not
the
red
one
but
nothing
happened
so
mother
was
dead
has
she
gone
to
hell
whispered
the
girl
no
she
gone
to
heaven
because
she
good
only
wicked
people
go
to
hell
and
now
i
must
go
and
tell
the
policeman
do
you
tell
father
where
i
gone
if
he
wakes
up
or
he
run
away
before
the
policeman
comes
why
so
as
not
to
go
to
hell
said
the
boy
with
certainty
and
they
went
downstairs
together
the
little
mind
of
the
girl
being
much
perturbed
because
she
was
so
wicked
what
would
mother
say
tomorrow
if
she
had
done
wrong
the
boy
put
on
his
sailor
hat
in
the
hall
you
must
go
in
there
and
watch
he
said
nodding
in
the
direction
of
the
i
shall
run
all
the
way
the
door
banged
and
she
heard
his
steps
down
the
path
and
then
everything
was
quiet
she
tiptoed
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
looked
at
the
back
of
the
chair
in
utter
distress
she
could
see
her
elbow
projecting
on
one
side
but
nothing
more
for
an
instant
she
hoped
that
he
was
there
hoped
that
he
had
gone
but
then
terrified
she
knew
that
this
was
a
piece
of
extreme
wickedness
so
she
lay
on
the
rough
carpet
sobbing
hopelessly
and
seeing
real
and
vicious
devils
of
her
brother
imagining
in
all
the
corners
of
the
room
presently
in
her
misery
she
remembered
a
packet
of
that
lay
in
her
pocket
and
drew
them
forth
in
a
sticky
mass
which
parted
from
its
paper
with
regret
so
she
choked
and
sucked
her
sweets
at
the
same
time
and
found
them
salt
and
tasteless
ray
was
gone
a
long
time
and
she
was
a
wicked
girl
who
would
go
to
hell
if
she
did
do
what
he
told
her
those
were
her
prevailing
ideas
and
presently
there
came
a
third
ray
had
said
that
if
her
father
woke
up
he
would
run
away
and
not
go
to
hell
at
all
now
if
she
woke
him
up
she
knew
this
was
dreadfully
naughty
but
her
mind
clung
to
the
idea
obstinately
you
see
father
had
always
been
so
fond
of
mother
and
he
would
not
like
to
be
in
a
different
place
mother
like
it
either
she
was
always
so
sorry
when
father
did
not
come
home
or
anything
and
hell
is
a
dreadful
place
full
of
things
she
half
convinced
herself
and
started
up
but
then
there
came
an
awful
thought
if
she
did
this
she
would
go
to
hell
for
ever
and
ever
and
all
the
others
would
be
in
heaven
she
hung
there
in
suspense
sucking
her
sweet
and
puzzling
it
over
with
knit
brows
how
can
one
be
good
she
swung
round
and
looked
in
the
dark
corner
by
the
piano
but
the
devil
was
not
there
and
then
she
ran
across
the
room
to
her
father
and
shaking
his
arm
shouted
tremulously
wake
up
father
wake
up
the
police
are
coming
and
when
the
police
came
ten
minutes
later
accompanied
by
a
very
proud
and
virtuous
little
boy
they
heard
a
small
shrill
voice
crying
despairingly
the
police
father
the
police
but
father
would
not
wake
the
biography
of
a
superman

that

charles
stephen
dale
the
subject
of
my
study
was
a
dramatist
and
indeed
something
of
a
celebrity
in
the
early
years
of
the
twentieth
century
that
he
should
be
already
completely
forgotten
is
by
no
means
astonishing
in
an
age
that
elects
its
great
men
with
a
charming
indecision
of
touch
the
general
prejudice
against
the
granting
of
freeholds
has
spread
to
the
desired
lands
of
fame
and
where
our
profligate
ancestors
were
willing
to
call
a
man
great
in
perpetuity
we
with
more
shrewdness
prefer
to
name
him
a
genius
for
seven
years
we
know
that
before
that
period
may
have
expired
fate
will
have
granted
us
a
with
yet
more
coils
with
a
yet
more
bewildering
arrangement
of
marine
and
sunset
tints
and
the
conclusion
of
previous
leases
will
enable
us
to
grant
him
undisputed
possession
of
parnassus
if
our
ancestors
were
more
generous
they
were
certainly
less
discriminate
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
many
of
them
went
to
their
graves
under
the
impression
that
it
is
possible
for
there
to
be
more
than
one
great
man
at
a
time
we
have
altered
all
that
for
two
years
dale
was
a
great
man
or
rather
the
great
man
and
it
is
probable
that
if
he
had
not
died
he
would
have
held
his
position
for
a
longer
period
when
his
death
was
announced
although
the
notices
of
his
life
and
work
were
of
a
flattering
length
the
leaderwriters
were
not
unnaturally
aggrieved
that
he
should
have
resigned
his
post
before
the
popular
interest
in
his
personality
was
exhausted
the
censor
might
do
his
best
by
prohibiting
the
performance
of
all
the
plays
that
the
dead
man
had
left
behind
him
but
as
the
author
neglected
to
express
his
views
in
their
columns
and
the
common
sense
of
their
readers
forbade
the
publication
of
interviews
with
him
the
journals
could
draw
but
a
poor
satisfaction
from
condemning
or
upholding
the
official
action
regrettable
absence
reduced
what
might
have
been
an
agreeable
clash
of
personalities
to
an
arid
discussion
on
art
the
consequence
was
obvious
the
end
of
the
week
saw
the
elevation
of
james
macintosh
the
great
scotch
comedian
to
the
vacant
post
and
dale
was
completely
forgotten
that
this
oblivion
is
merited
in
terms
of
his
work
i
am
not
prepared
to
admit
that
it
is
merited
in
terms
of
his
personality
i
indignantly
wish
to
deny
whatever
dale
may
have
been
as
an
artist
he
was
perhaps
in
spite
of
himself
a
man
and
a
man
moreover
possessed
of
many
striking
and
unusual
traits
of
character
it
is
to
the
man
dale
that
i
offer
this
tribute
sprung
from
an
old
yorkshire
family
charles
stephen
dale
was
yet
sufficient
of
a
cockney
to
justify
both
his
friends
and
his
enemies
in
crediting
him
with
the
celtic
temperament
nevertheless
he
was
essentially
a
modern
insomuch
that
his
contempt
for
the
writings
of
dead
men
surpassed
his
dislike
of
living
authors
to
these
two
central
influences
we
may
trace
most
of
the
peculiarities
that
rendered
him
notorious
and
ultimately
great
thus
while
his
celtic
æstheticism
permitted
him
to
eat
nothing
but
raw
meat
because
he
mistrusted
alike
the
reeking
products
of
the
and
the
barbaric
fingers
of
cooks
it
was
surely
his
modernity
that
made
him
an
agnostic
because
bishops
sat
in
the
house
of
lords
smaller
men
might
dislike
vegetables
and
bishops
without
allowing
it
to
affect
their
conduct
but
dale
was
careful
to
observe
that
every
slightest
conviction
should
have
its
place
in
the
formation
of
his
character
conversely
he
was
nothing
without
a
reason
these
may
seem
small
things
to
which
to
trace
the
motive
forces
of
a
man
life
but
if
we
add
to
them
a
third
found
where
the
truth
about
a
man
not
infrequently
lies
in
the
of
his
enemies
our
materials
will
be
nearly
complete
dale
hates
his
beings
wrote
some
anonymous
scribbler
and
even
expressed
thus
baldly
the
statement
is
not
wholly
false
but
he
hated
them
because
of
their
imperfections
and
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
his
love
of
humanity
amounted
to
a
positive
hatred
of
individuals
and
the
critics
the
love
was
no
less
sincere
than
the
hatred
he
had
drawn
from
the
mental
confusion
of
the
darker
german
philosophers
an
image
of
the
perfect
man
an
image
differing
only
in
inessentials
from
the
idol
worshipped
by
the
imperialists
as
efficiency
he
did
not
find
it
was
hardly
likely
that
he
would
find
that
his
contemporaries
fulfilled
this
perfect
conception
and
he
therefore
felt
it
necessary
to
condemn
them
for
the
possession
of
those
weaknesses
or
as
some
would
prefer
to
say
qualities
of
which
the
sum
is
human
nature
i
now
approach
a
quality
or
rather
the
lack
of
a
quality
that
is
in
itself
of
so
debatable
a
character
that
were
it
not
of
the
utmost
importance
in
considering
the
life
of
charles
stephen
dale
i
should
prefer
not
to
mention
it
i
refer
to
his
complete
lack
of
a
sense
of
humour
the
consciousness
of
which
deficiency
went
so
far
to
detract
from
his
importance
as
an
artist
and
a
man
the
difficulty
which
i
mentioned
above
lies
in
the
fact
that
while
every
one
has
a
clear
conception
of
what
they
mean
by
the
phrase
no
one
has
yet
succeeded
in
defining
it
satisfactorily
here
i
would
venture
to
suggest
that
it
is
a
kind
of
magnificent
sense
of
proportion
a
sense
that
relates
the
infinite
greatness
of
the
universe
to
the
finite
smallness
of
man
and
draws
the
inevitable
conclusion
as
to
the
importance
of
our
joys
and
sorrows
and
labours
i
am
aware
that
this
definition
errs
on
the
side
of
vagueness
but
possibly
it
may
be
found
to
include
the
truth
obviously
the
natures
of
those
who
possess
this
sense
will
tend
to
be
static
rather
than
dynamic
and
it
is
therefore
against
the
limits
imposed
by
this
sense
that
intellectual
anarchists
among
whom
i
would
number
dale
and
poets
primarily
rebel
but
and
it
is
this
rather
than
his
undoubted
intellectual
gifts
or
his
dogmatic
definitions
of
good
and
evil
that
definitely
separated
dale
from
the
normal
men
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
felt
his
lack
of
a
sense
of
humour
bitterly
in
every
word
he
ever
said
in
every
line
he
ever
wrote
i
detect
a
painful
striving
after
this
mysterious
sense
that
enabled
his
neighbours
fools
as
he
undoubtedly
thought
them
to
laugh
and
weep
and
follow
the
faith
of
their
hearts
without
conscious
realisation
of
their
own
existence
and
the
problems
it
induced
by
dint
of
study
and
strenuous
observation
he
achieved
as
any
man
may
achieve
a
considerable
degree
of
wit
though
to
the
last
his
ignorance
of
the
audience
whom
he
served
and
despised
prevented
him
from
judging
the
effect
of
his
sallies
without
experiment
but
try
as
he
might
the
finer
jewel
lay
far
beyond
his
reach
strong
men
fight
themselves
when
they
can
find
no
fitter
adversary
but
in
all
the
history
of
literature
there
is
no
stranger
spectacle
than
this
lifelong
contest
between
dale
the
intellectual
anarch
and
pioneer
of
supermen
and
dale
the
poor
lonely
devil
who
wondered
what
made
people
happy
i
have
said
that
the
struggle
was
lifelong
but
it
must
be
added
that
it
was
always
unequal
the
knowledge
that
in
his
secret
heart
he
desired
this
quality
the
imperfection
of
imperfections
only
served
to
make
dale
attack
on
the
complacency
of
his
contemporaries
more
bitter
he
ridiculed
their
achievements
their
ambitions
and
their
love
with
a
fury
that
awakened
in
them
a
mild
curiosity
but
by
no
means
affected
their
comfort
moreover
the
very
vehemence
with
which
he
demanded
their
contempt
deprived
him
of
much
of
his
force
as
a
critic
for
they
justly
wondered
why
a
man
should
waste
his
lifetime
in
attacking
them
if
they
were
indeed
so
worthless
actually
they
felt
dale
was
a
great
deal
more
engaged
with
his
audience
than
many
of
the
imaginative
writers
whom
he
affected
to
despise
for
their
sycophancy
and
especially
towards
the
end
of
his
life
when
his
powers
perhaps
were
weakening
the
devices
which
he
used
to
arouse
the
irritation
of
his
contemporaries
became
more
and
more
childishly
artificial
less
and
less
effective
he
was
like
one
of
those
actors
who
feel
that
they
can
not
hold
the
attention
of
their
audience
unless
they
are
always
doing
something
though
nothing
is
more
monotonous
than
mannered
vivacity
dale
then
was
a
man
who
was
very
anxious
to
be
modern
but
at
the
same
time
had
not
wholly
succeeded
in
conquering
his
æesthetic
sense
he
had
constituted
himself
high
priest
of
the
most
puritanical
and
remote
of
all
creeds
yet
there
was
that
in
his
blood
that
rebelled
ceaselessly
against
the
intellectual
limits
he
had
voluntarily
accepted
the
result
in
terms
of
art
was
chaos
possessed
of
an
intellect
of
great
analytic
and
destructive
force
he
was
almost
entirely
lacking
in
imagination
and
he
was
therefore
unable
to
raise
his
work
to
a
plane
in
which
the
mutually
combative
elements
of
his
nature
might
have
been
reconciled
his
light
moments
of
envy
anger
and
vanity
passed
into
the
crucible
to
come
forth
unchanged
he
lacked
the
magic
wand
and
his
work
never
took
wings
above
his
conception
it
is
in
vain
to
seek
in
any
of
his
plays
or
novels
tracts
or
prefaces
for
the
product
of
inspiration
the
divine
gift
that
enables
one
man
to
write
with
the
common
pen
of
humanity
he
could
only
employ
his
curiously
perfect
technique
in
reproducing
the
wayward
flashes
of
a
mind
incapable
of
consecutive
thought
he
never
attempted
and
this
is
a
hard
saying
to
produce
any
work
beautiful
in
itself
while
the
confusion
of
his
mind
and
the
vanity
that
never
allowed
him
to
ignore
the
effect
his
work
might
produce
on
his
audience
prevented
him
from
giving
clear
expression
to
his
creed
his
work
will
appeal
rather
to
the
student
of
men
than
to
the
student
of
art
and
wantonly
incoherent
though
it
often
is
must
be
held
to
constitute
a
remarkable
human
document
it
is
strange
to
reflect
that
among
his
contemporary
admirers
dale
was
credited
with
an
intellect
of
unusual
clarity
for
the
examination
of
any
of
his
plays
impresses
one
with
the
number
and
mutual
destructiveness
of
his
motives
for
artistic
expression
a
noted
debater
he
made
frequent
use
of
the
device
of
attacking
the
weakness
of
the
other
man
speech
rather
than
the
weakness
of
the
other
man
argument
his
prose
was
good
though
at
its
best
so
impersonal
that
it
recalled
the
manner
of
an
exceptionally
leading
article
at
its
worst
it
was
marred
by
numerous
vulgarities
and
errors
of
taste
not
always
it
is
to
be
feared
intentional
his
attitude
on
this
point
was
typical
of
his
strange
blindness
to
the
necessity
of
a
pure
artistic
ideal
he
committed
these
extravagances
he
would
say
in
order
to
irritate
his
audience
into
a
condition
of
mental
alertness
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
generally
made
his
readers
more
sorry
than
angry
and
he
did
not
realise
that
even
if
he
had
been
successful
it
was
but
a
poor
reward
for
the
wanton
spoiling
of
much
good
work
he
proclaimed
himself
to
be
above
criticism
but
he
was
only
too
often
beneath
it
revolting
against
the
dignity
not
infrequently
pompous
of
his
of
letters
he
played
the
part
of
clown
with
more
enthusiasm
than
skill
it
is
intellectual
arrogance
in
a
clever
man
to
believe
that
he
can
play
the
fool
with
success
merely
because
he
wishes
it
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
enter
into
detail
with
regard
to
personal
appearance
the
caricaturists
did
him
rather
more
than
justice
the
photographers
rather
less
in
his
younger
days
he
suggested
a
gingerbread
man
that
had
been
left
too
long
in
the
sun
towards
the
end
he
affected
a
cultured
and
elaborate
ruggedness
that
made
him
look
like
a
duke
or
a
market
gardener
like
most
clever
men
he
had
good
eyes
nor
is
it
my
purpose
to
add
more
than
a
word
to
the
published
accounts
of
his
death
there
is
something
strangely
pitiful
in
that
last
desperate
effort
to
achieve
humour
we
have
all
read
the
account
of
his
own
death
that
he
dictated
from
the
cold
epigrammatic
and
alas
characteristically
lacking
in
taste
and
once
more
it
was
his
fate
to
make
us
rather
sorry
than
angry
in
the
third
scene
of
the
second
act
of
henry
a
play
written
by
an
author
whom
dale
pretended
to
despise
dame
quickly
describes
the
death
of
falstaff
in
words
that
are
too
well
known
to
need
quotation
it
was
thus
and
no
otherwise
that
dale
died
it
is
thus
that
every
man
dies
blue
blood
he
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
great
café
with
his
head
supported
on
his
hands
miserable
even
to
bitterness
inwardly
he
cursed
the
ancestors
who
had
left
him
little
but
a
great
name
and
a
small
and
ridiculous
body
he
thought
of
his
father
whose
expensive
eccentricities
had
amused
his
at
the
cost
of
his
fortune
his
mother
for
whom
death
had
been
a
blessing
his
grandparents
and
his
uncles
in
whom
no
man
had
found
any
good
but
most
of
all
he
cursed
himself
for
whose
follies
even
heredity
might
not
wholly
account
he
recalled
the
school
where
he
had
made
no
friends
the
university
where
he
had
taken
no
degree
since
he
had
left
oxford
his
aimless
hopeless
life
profligate
but
dishonourable
perhaps
only
by
accident
had
deprived
even
his
title
of
any
social
value
and
one
by
one
his
very
acquaintances
had
left
him
to
the
society
of
broken
men
and
the
women
who
are
anything
but
light
and
these
and
here
perhaps
the
root
of
his
bitterness
lay
even
these
recognised
him
only
as
a
victim
for
their
mockery
a
thing
more
poor
than
themselves
whereon
they
could
satisfy
the
anger
of
their
tortured
souls
and
his
last
misery
lay
in
this
that
he
himself
could
find
no
day
in
his
life
to
admire
no
one
past
dream
to
cherish
no
inmost
corner
of
his
heart
to
love
the
lowest
tramp
the
waif
of
the
night
might
have
some
ultimate
pride
but
he
himself
had
nothing
nothing
whatever
he
was
a
an
emotional
bankrupt
with
a
choked
sob
he
drained
his
brandy
and
told
the
waiter
to
bring
him
another
there
had
been
a
period
in
his
life
when
he
had
been
able
to
find
some
measure
of
sentimental
satisfaction
in
the
stupor
of
drunkenness
in
those
days
through
the
veil
of
illusion
which
alcohol
had
flung
across
his
brain
he
had
been
able
to
regard
the
contempt
of
the
men
as
the
intimacy
of
friendship
the
scorn
of
the
women
as
the
laughter
of
light
love
but
now
drink
gave
him
nothing
but
the
mordant
insight
of
morbidity
which
cut
through
his
rotten
soul
like
cheese
yet
night
after
night
he
came
to
this
place
to
be
tortured
afresh
by
the
ridicule
of
the
sordid
frequenters
and
by
the
careless
music
of
the
orchestra
which
told
him
of
a
flowerless
spring
and
of
a
morning
which
held
for
him
no
hope
for
his
last
emotion
rested
in
this
pain
he
could
only
breathe
freely
under
the
lash
of
his
own
contempt
idly
he
let
his
dull
eyes
stray
about
the
room
from
table
to
table
from
face
to
face
many
there
he
knew
by
sight
from
none
could
he
hope
for
sympathy
or
even
companionship
in
his
bitterness
he
envied
the
courage
of
the
cowards
who
were
brave
enough
to
seek
oblivion
or
punishment
in
death
dropping
his
eyes
to
his
soft
unlovely
hands
he
marvelled
that
anything
so
useless
should
throb
with
life
and
yet
he
realised
that
he
was
afraid
of
physical
pain
terrified
at
the
thought
of
death
there
were
dim
ancestors
of
his
whose
valour
had
thrilled
the
songs
of
minstrels
and
made
his
name
lovely
in
the
glowing
folly
of
battles
but
now
he
knew
that
he
was
a
coward
and
even
in
the
knowledge
he
could
find
no
comfort
it
is
not
given
to
every
man
to
hate
himself
gladly
the
music
and
the
laughter
beat
on
his
sullen
brain
with
a
mocking
insistence
and
he
trembled
with
impotent
anger
at
the
apparent
happiness
of
humanity
why
should
these
people
be
merry
when
he
was
miserable
what
right
had
the
orchestra
to
play
a
chorus
of
triumph
over
the
stinging
emblems
of
his
defeat
he
drank
brandy
after
brandy
vainly
seeking
to
dull
the
nausea
of
disgust
which
had
stricken
his
worn
nerves
but
the
adulterated
spirit
merely
maddened
his
brain
with
the
vision
of
new
depths
of
horror
while
his
body
lay
below
a
mean
detestable
thing
had
he
known
how
to
pray
he
would
have
begged
that
something
might
snap
but
no
man
may
win
to
faith
by
means
of
hatred
alone
and
his
heart
was
cold
as
the
marble
table
against
which
he
leant
there
was
no
more
hope
in
the
when
he
came
out
of
the
café
the
air
of
the
night
was
so
pure
and
cool
on
his
face
and
the
lights
of
the
square
were
so
tender
to
his
eyes
that
for
a
moment
his
harsh
mood
was
softened
and
in
that
moment
he
seemed
to
see
among
the
crowd
that
flocked
by
a
beautiful
face
a
face
touched
with
pearls
and
the
inner
leaves
of
pink
rosebuds
he
leant
forward
eagerly
christine
he
cried
christine
then
the
illusion
passed
and
smitten
by
the
anger
of
the
pitiless
stars
he
saw
that
he
was
looking
upon
a
mere
woman
a
woman
of
the
earth
he
fled
from
her
smile
with
a
shudder
as
he
went
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
swaying
houses
buffeted
him
about
as
a
child
might
play
with
a
ball
sometimes
they
threw
him
against
men
who
cursed
him
and
bruised
his
soft
body
with
their
fists
sometimes
they
tripped
him
up
and
hurled
him
upon
the
stones
of
the
pavement
still
he
held
on
till
the
embankment
broke
before
him
with
the
sudden
peace
of
space
and
he
leant
against
the
parapet
panting
and
sick
with
pain
but
free
from
the
tyranny
of
the
houses
beneath
him
the
river
rolled
towards
the
sea
reticent
but
more
alive
it
seemed
than
the
deeply
painful
thing
which
fate
had
attached
to
his
brain
he
pictured
himself
tangled
in
the
dark
perplexity
of
its
waters
he
fancied
them
falling
upon
his
face
like
a
girl
hair
till
they
darkened
his
eyes
and
choked
the
mouth
which
even
now
could
not
breathe
fast
enough
to
satisfy
him
the
thought
displeased
him
and
he
turned
away
from
the
place
that
held
peace
for
other
men
but
not
for
him
from
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
seats
a
woman
voice
reached
him
begging
peevishly
for
money
i
have
none
he
said
automatically
then
he
remembered
and
flung
coins
all
the
money
he
had
into
her
lap
i
give
it
to
you
because
i
hate
you
he
shrieked
and
hurried
on
lest
her
thanks
should
spoil
his
spite
then
the
black
houses
and
the
warped
streets
had
him
in
their
grip
once
more
and
sported
with
him
till
his
consciousness
waxed
to
one
point
of
pain
overhead
the
stars
were
laughing
quietly
in
the
fields
of
space
and
sometimes
a
policeman
or
a
chance
looked
curiously
at
his
lurching
figure
but
he
only
knew
that
life
was
hurting
him
beyond
endurance
and
that
he
yet
endured
up
and
down
the
corridors
of
his
brain
thought
formless
and
timeless
passed
like
a
rodent
flame
now
he
was
the
universe
a
vast
thing
loathsome
with
agony
now
he
was
a
speck
of
dust
an
atom
whose
infinite
torment
was
imperceptible
even
to
god
always
there
was
something
something
conscious
of
the
intolerable
evil
called
life
something
that
cried
bitterly
to
be
uncreated
always
while
his
soul
beat
against
the
bars
his
body
staggered
along
the
streets
a
thing
helpless
unguided
there
is
an
hour
before
dawn
when
tired
men
and
women
die
and
with
the
coming
of
this
hour
his
spirit
found
a
strange
release
from
pain
once
more
he
realised
that
he
was
a
man
and
bruised
and
weary
as
he
was
he
tried
to
collect
the
lost
threads
of
reason
which
the
night
had
torn
from
him
facing
him
he
saw
a
vast
building
dimly
outlined
against
the
darkness
and
in
some
way
it
served
to
touch
a
faint
memory
in
his
dying
brain
for
a
while
he
wandered
amongst
the
shadows
and
then
he
knew
that
it
was
the
keep
of
a
castle
his
castle
and
that
high
up
where
a
window
shone
upon
the
night
a
girl
was
waiting
for
him
a
girl
with
a
face
of
pearls
and
roses
presently
she
came
to
the
window
and
looked
out
dressed
all
in
white
for
her
love
sake
he
stood
up
in
his
armour
and
flashed
his
sword
towards
the
envying
stars
it
is
i
my
love
he
cried
i
am
here
and
there
before
the
dawn
had
made
the
shadows
of
the
law
courts
grey
they
found
him
bruised
and
muddy
and
daubed
with
blood
without
the
sword
and
spurs
of
his
honour
lacking
the
scented
token
of
his
love
a
thing
in
no
way
tragic
for
here
was
no
misfortune
but
merely
the
conclusion
of
nature
remorseless
logic
for
century
after
century
those
of
his
name
had
lived
sheltered
by
the
prowess
of
their
ancestors
from
the
trivial
hardships
and
afflictions
that
make
us
men
and
now
he
lay
on
the
pavement
stiff
and
cold
a
babe
that
had
cried
itself
to
sleep
because
it
could
not
understand
silent
until
the
morning
fate
and
the
artist
the
workmen
dwellings
stood
in
the
northwest
of
london
in
quaint
rivalry
with
the
comfortable
ugliness
of
the
maida
vale
blocks
of
flats
they
were
fairly
new
and
very
well
built
with
wide
stone
staircases
that
echoed
all
day
to
the
impatient
footsteps
of
children
and
with
a
flat
roof
that
served
at
once
as
a
playground
for
them
and
a
for
their
mothers
washing
in
hot
weather
it
was
pleasant
enough
to
play
or
up
and
down
the
long
alleys
of
cool
white
linen
and
if
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
or
some
unexpected
turn
of
the
game
set
the
wet
sheets
flapping
in
the
children
faces
their
senses
were
rather
tickled
than
annoyed
to
george
mooning
in
a
corner
of
the
railings
that
seemed
to
keep
all
london
in
a
cage
these
games
were
hardly
more
important
than
the
shoutings
and
whistlings
that
rose
from
the
street
below
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
his
life
he
had
lived
eleven
years
he
had
been
standing
in
a
corner
watching
other
people
engaging
in
meaningless
ploys
and
antics
the
sun
was
hot
and
yet
the
children
ran
about
and
made
themselves
hotter
and
he
wondered
as
when
he
had
been
in
bed
with
one
of
his
frequent
illnesses
he
had
wondered
at
the
folk
who
came
and
went
moving
their
arms
and
legs
and
speaking
with
their
mouths
when
it
was
possible
to
lie
still
and
quiet
and
feel
the
moments
ticking
themselves
off
in
one
forehead
as
he
rested
in
his
corner
he
was
conscious
of
the
sharp
edge
of
the
narrow
stone
ledge
on
which
he
was
sitting
and
the
thin
iron
railings
that
pressed
into
his
back
he
smelt
the
evil
smell
of
hot
london
and
the
soapy
odour
of
the
washing
he
saw
the
glitter
of
the
dust
and
the
noises
of
the
place
beat
harshly
upon
his
ears
but
he
could
find
no
meaning
in
it
all
life
spoke
to
him
with
a
hundred
tongues
and
all
the
while
he
was
longing
for
silence
to
the
older
inhabitants
of
the
tenements
he
seemed
a
morbid
little
boy
unhappily
too
delicate
for
sense
to
be
safely
knocked
into
him
his
would
have
ignored
him
completely
if
he
had
not
had
strange
fancies
that
made
interesting
stories
and
sometimes
inspired
games
on
the
whole
george
was
lonely
without
knowing
what
loneliness
meant
all
day
long
the
voice
of
london
throbbed
up
beyond
the
bars
and
george
would
regard
the
chimneys
and
the
housetops
and
the
section
of
lively
street
that
fell
within
his
range
with
his
small
keen
eyes
and
wonder
why
the
world
did
not
forthwith
crumble
into
silent
peaceful
dust
instead
of
groaning
and
quivering
in
continual
unrest
but
when
twilight
fell
and
the
children
were
tired
of
playing
they
would
gather
round
him
in
his
corner
by
the
tank
and
ask
him
to
tell
them
stories
this
tank
was
large
and
open
and
held
rain
water
for
the
use
of
the
tenants
and
originally
it
had
been
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
roof
by
some
special
railings
of
its
own
but
two
of
the
railings
had
been
broken
and
now
the
children
could
creep
through
and
sit
round
the
tank
at
dusk
like
eastern
villagers
round
the
village
well
and
george
would
tell
them
stories
queer
stories
with
twisted
faces
and
broken
backs
that
danced
and
capered
merrily
enough
as
a
rule
but
sometimes
stood
quite
still
and
made
horrible
grimaces
the
children
liked
the
cheerful
moral
stories
better
such
as
boots
once
upon
a
time
george
would
begin
there
was
a
boy
called
arthur
who
lived
in
a
house
like
this
and
always
tied
his
bootlaces
with
knots
instead
of
bows
one
night
he
stood
on
the
roof
and
wished
he
had
wings
like
a
sparrow
so
that
he
could
fly
away
over
the
houses
and
a
great
wind
began
so
that
everybody
said
there
was
a
storm
and
suddenly
arthur
found
he
had
a
little
pair
of
wings
and
he
flew
away
with
the
wind
over
the
houses
and
presently
he
got
beyond
the
storm
to
a
quiet
place
in
the
sky
and
arthur
looked
up
and
saw
all
the
stars
tied
to
heaven
with
little
bits
of
string
and
all
the
strings
were
tied
in
bows
and
this
was
done
so
that
god
could
pull
the
string
quite
easily
when
he
wanted
to
and
let
the
stars
fall
on
fine
nights
you
can
see
them
dropping
arthur
thought
that
the
angels
must
have
very
neat
fingers
to
tie
so
many
bows
but
suddenly
while
he
was
looking
his
feet
began
to
feel
heavy
and
he
stooped
down
to
take
off
his
boots
but
he
could
not
untie
the
knots
quick
enough
and
soon
he
started
falling
very
fast
and
while
he
was
falling
he
heard
the
wind
in
the
telegraph
wires
and
the
shouts
of
the
boys
who
sell
papers
in
the
street
and
then
he
fell
on
the
top
of
a
house
and
they
took
him
to
the
hospital
and
cut
off
his
legs
and
gave
him
wooden
ones
instead
but
he
could
not
fly
any
more
because
they
were
too
heavy
for
days
afterwards
all
the
children
would
tie
their
bootlaces
in
bows
sometimes
they
would
all
look
into
the
dark
tank
and
george
would
tell
them
about
the
splendid
fish
that
lived
in
its
depths
if
the
tank
was
only
half
full
he
would
whisper
to
the
fish
and
the
children
would
hear
its
indistinct
reply
but
when
the
tank
was
full
to
the
brim
he
said
that
the
fish
was
too
happy
to
talk
and
he
would
describe
the
beauty
of
its
appearance
so
vividly
that
all
the
children
would
lean
over
the
tank
and
strain
their
eyes
in
a
desperate
effort
to
see
the
wonderful
fish
but
no
one
ever
saw
it
clearly
except
george
though
most
of
the
children
thought
they
had
seen
its
tail
disappearing
in
the
shadows
at
one
time
or
another
it
was
doubtful
how
far
the
children
believed
his
stories
probably
not
having
acquired
the
habit
of
examining
evidence
they
were
content
to
accept
ideas
that
threw
a
pleasant
glamour
on
life
but
the
coming
of
jimmy
simpson
altered
this
agreeable
condition
of
mind
jimmy
was
one
of
those
masterful
stupid
boys
who
excel
at
games
and
physical
contests
and
triumph
over
intellectual
problems
by
sheer
braggart
ignorance
from
the
first
he
regarded
george
with
contempt
and
when
he
heard
him
telling
his
stories
he
did
not
conceal
his
disbelief
it
a
lie
he
said
there
ai
no
fish
in
the
tank
i
have
seen
it
i
tell
you
said
george
jimmy
spat
on
the
asphalt
rudely
i
bet
no
one
else
has
he
said
george
looked
round
his
audience
but
their
eyes
did
not
meet
his
they
felt
that
they
might
have
been
mistaken
in
believing
that
they
had
seen
the
tail
of
the
fish
and
jimmy
was
a
very
good
man
with
his
fists
liar
said
jimmy
at
last
triumphantly
and
walked
away
being
masterful
he
led
the
others
with
him
and
george
brooded
by
the
tank
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
solitude
next
day
george
went
up
to
jimmy
confidently
i
was
right
about
the
fish
he
said
i
dreamed
about
it
last
night
rot
said
jimmy
dreams
are
only
things
they
do
mean
anything
george
crept
away
sadly
how
could
he
convince
such
a
man
all
day
long
he
worried
over
the
problem
and
he
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
it
throbbing
in
his
brain
and
suddenly
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
doubt
came
to
him
supposing
he
had
been
wrong
supposing
he
had
never
seen
the
fish
at
all
this
was
not
to
be
borne
he
crept
quietly
out
of
the
flat
and
tiptoed
upstairs
to
the
roof
the
stone
was
very
cold
to
his
feet
there
were
so
many
things
in
the
tank
that
at
first
george
could
not
see
the
fish
but
at
last
he
saw
it
gleaming
below
the
moon
and
the
stars
larger
and
even
more
beautiful
than
he
had
said
i
knew
i
was
right
he
whispered
as
he
crept
back
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
was
very
ill
meanwhile
blue
day
succeeded
blue
day
and
while
the
water
grew
lower
in
the
tank
the
children
with
jimmy
for
leader
had
almost
forgotten
the
boy
who
had
told
them
stories
now
and
again
one
or
other
of
them
would
say
that
george
was
very
very
ill
and
then
they
would
go
on
with
their
game
no
one
looked
in
the
tank
now
that
they
knew
there
was
nothing
in
it
till
it
occurred
one
day
to
jimmy
that
the
dry
weather
should
have
brought
final
confirmation
of
his
scepticism
leaving
his
comrades
at
the
long
jump
he
went
to
george
neglected
corner
and
peeped
into
the
tank
sure
enough
it
was
almost
dry
and
he
nearly
shouted
with
surprise
in
the
shallow
pool
of
sooty
water
there
lay
a
large
fish
dead
but
still
gleaming
with
rainbow
colours
jimmy
was
strong
and
stupid
but
not
and
recalling
george
illness
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
a
decent
thing
to
go
and
tell
him
he
was
right
he
ran
downstairs
and
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
flat
where
george
lived
george
big
sister
opened
it
but
the
boy
was
too
excited
to
see
that
her
eyes
were
wet
oh
miss
he
said
breathlessly
tell
george
he
was
right
about
the
fish
i
seen
it
myself
georgy
dead
said
the
girl
the
great
man
to
the
people
who
do
not
write
it
must
seem
odd
that
men
and
women
should
be
willing
to
sacrifice
their
lives
in
the
endeavour
to
find
new
arrangements
and
combinations
of
words
with
which
to
express
old
thoughts
and
older
emotions
yet
that
is
not
an
unfair
statement
of
the
task
of
the
literary
artist
words
symbols
that
represent
the
noises
that
human
beings
make
with
their
tongues
and
lips
and
teeth
lie
within
our
grasp
like
the
fragments
of
a
puzzle
and
we
fit
them
into
faulty
pictures
until
our
hands
grow
weary
and
our
eyes
can
no
longer
pretend
to
see
the
truth
in
order
to
illustrate
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
our
lives
by
means
of
this
preposterous
game
we
are
willing
to
sacrifice
all
the
rest
while
ordinary
efficient
men
and
women
are
enjoying
the
promise
of
the
morning
the
fulfilment
of
the
afternoon
the
tranquillity
of
evening
we
are
still
trying
to
discover
a
fitting
epithet
for
the
dew
of
dawn
for
us
spring
paves
the
woods
with
beautiful
words
rather
than
flowers
and
when
we
look
into
the
eyes
of
our
mistress
we
see
nothing
but
adjectives
love
is
an
occasion
for
songs
death
but
the
overburdened
father
of
all
our
saddest
phrases
we
are
of
those
who
are
born
crying
into
the
world
because
they
can
not
speak
and
we
end
like
stevenson
by
looking
forward
to
our
death
because
we
have
written
a
good
epitaph
sometimes
in
the
course
of
our
frequent
descents
from
heaven
to
the
basket
we
feel
that
we
lose
too
much
to
accomplish
so
little
does
a
handful
of
really
outweigh
the
smile
of
a
pretty
girl
or
a
romance
compensate
the
author
for
months
of
lost
adventure
we
have
only
one
life
to
live
and
we
spend
the
greater
part
of
it
writing
the
history
of
dead
hours
our
lives
lack
balance
because
we
find
it
hard
to
discover
a
mean
between
the
triolet
we
wrote
last
i
night
and
the
big
book
we
are
going
to
start
tomorrow
and
also
because
living
only
with
our
heads
we
tend
to
become
we
justify
our
present
discomfort
with
the
promise
of
a
bright
future
of
flowers
and
sunshine
and
gladdest
life
though
we
know
that
in
the
garden
of
art
there
are
many
chrysalides
and
few
butterflies
few
of
us
are
fortunate
enough
to
accomplish
anything
that
was
in
the
least
worth
doing
so
we
fall
back
on
the
arid
philosophy
that
it
is
effort
alone
that
counts
luckily
or
suicide
would
be
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
for
artists
the
long
process
of
disillusionment
is
broken
by
hours
when
even
the
most
feel
nobly
and
indubitably
great
and
this
is
the
only
reward
that
most
artists
ever
have
for
their
labours
if
we
set
a
higher
price
on
art
than
money
on
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
artist
is
fully
rewarded
for
the
common
man
can
have
no
conception
of
the
joy
that
is
to
be
found
in
belonging
though
but
momentarily
and
illusively
to
the
aristocracy
of
genius
to
find
the
just
word
for
all
our
emotions
to
realise
that
our
most
trivial
thought
is
illimitably
creative
to
feel
that
it
is
our
lot
to
keep
life
gladdest
promises
to
see
the
great
souls
of
men
and
women
steadfast
in
existence
as
stars
in
a
windless
pool
these
indeed
are
no
ordinary
pleasures
moreover
these
hours
of
our
illusory
greatness
endow
us
in
their
passing
with
a
melancholy
that
is
not
tainted
with
bitteress
we
have
nothing
to
regret
we
are
in
truth
the
richer
for
our
rare
adventure
we
have
been
permitted
to
explore
the
ultimate
possibilities
of
our
nature
and
if
we
might
not
keep
this
territory
at
least
we
did
not
return
from
our
travels
with
empty
hands
something
of
the
glamour
lingers
something
perhaps
of
the
wisdom
and
it
is
with
a
heightened
passion
a
fiercer
enthusiasm
that
we
set
ourselves
once
more
to
our
task
of
chalking
pink
salmon
and
pinker
sunsets
on
the
pavements
of
the
world
i
once
met
an
englishman
in
the
forest
that
starts
outside
brussels
and
stretches
for
a
long
day
journey
across
the
hills
we
found
a
little
café
under
the
trees
and
sat
in
the
sun
talking
about
modern
english
literature
all
the
afternoon
in
this
way
we
discovered
that
we
had
a
common
standpoint
from
which
we
judged
works
of
art
though
our
judgments
differed
pleasantly
and
provided
us
with
materials
for
agreeable
discussion
by
the
time
we
had
divided
three
bottles
of
gueze
lambic
the
noble
beer
of
belgium
we
had
already
sketched
out
a
scheme
for
the
ideal
literary
newspaper
in
other
words
we
had
achieved
friendship
when
the
afternoon
grew
suddenly
cold
the
englishman
led
me
off
to
tea
at
his
house
which
was
up
the
hill
out
of
woluwe
it
was
one
of
those
modern
country
cottages
that
belgian
architects
steal
openly
and
without
shame
from
their
english
confreres
we
were
met
at
the
garden
gate
by
his
daughter
a
girl
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
so
unreasonably
beautiful
that
she
made
a
disillusioned
scribbler
feel
like
a
sad
line
out
of
one
of
the
saddest
poems
of
francis
thompson
in
my
mind
i
christened
her
monica
because
i
did
not
like
her
real
name
the
house
with
its
old
furniture
its
library
where
the
choice
of
books
was
clearly
dictated
by
individual
prejudices
and
affections
and
its
unambitious
parade
of
domestic
happiness
heightened
my
melancholy
while
tea
was
being
prepared
monica
showed
me
the
garden
only
a
few
daffodils
and
crocuses
were
in
bloom
but
she
led
me
to
the
rose
garden
and
told
me
that
in
the
summer
she
could
pick
a
great
basket
of
roses
every
day
i
pictured
monica
to
myself
gathering
her
roses
on
a
breathless
summer
afternoon
and
returned
to
the
house
feeling
like
a
battened
version
of
the
reverend
laurence
sterne
i
knew
that
i
had
gathered
all
my
roses
and
i
thought
regretfully
of
the
chill
loneliness
of
the
world
that
lay
beyond
the
limits
of
this
paradise
this
mood
lingered
with
me
during
tea
and
it
was
not
till
that
meal
was
over
that
the
miracle
happened
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
the
englishman
or
his
wife
that
wrought
the
magic
or
perhaps
it
was
monica
nibbling
speculations
with
her
sharp
white
teeth
but
at
all
events
i
was
led
with
delicate
diplomacy
to
talk
about
myself
and
i
presently
realised
that
i
was
performing
the
grateful
labour
really
well
my
words
were
warmed
into
life
by
an
eloquence
that
is
not
ordinarily
mine
my
adjectives
were
neither
commonplace
nor
my
adverbs
fell
into
their
sockets
with
a
sob
of
joy
i
spoke
of
myself
with
a
noble
sympathy
a
compassion
so
intense
that
it
seemed
divinely
altruistic
and
gradually
as
the
spirit
of
creation
woke
in
my
blood
i
revealed
trembling
between
a
natural
sensitiveness
and
a
generous
abandonment
of
restraint
the
inner
life
of
a
man
of
genius
i
passed
lightly
by
his
misunderstood
childhood
to
concentrate
my
sympathies
on
the
literary
struggles
of
his
youth
i
spoke
of
the
ignoble
environment
the
material
hardships
the
masterpieces
written
at
night
to
be
condemned
in
the
morning
the
songs
of
his
heart
that
were
too
great
for
his
immature
voice
to
sing
and
all
the
while
i
bade
them
watch
the
fire
of
his
faith
burning
with
a
constant
and
quenchless
flame
i
traced
the
development
of
his
powers
and
instanced
some
of
his
poems
my
poems
which
i
recited
so
well
that
they
sounded
to
me
and
i
swear
to
them
also
like
staves
from
an
angelic
i
asked
their
compassion
for
the
man
who
having
such
things
in
his
heart
was
compelled
to
waste
his
hours
in
sordid
journalistic
labours
so
by
degrees
i
brought
them
to
the
present
time
when
fatigued
by
a
world
that
would
not
acknowledge
the
truth
of
his
message
the
man
of
genius
was
preparing
to
retire
from
life
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
the
composition
of
five
or
six
masterpieces
i
described
these
masterpieces
to
them
in
outline
with
a
suggestive
detail
dashed
in
here
and
there
to
show
how
they
would
be
finished
nothing
is
easier
than
to
describe
unwritten
literary
masterpieces
in
outline
but
by
that
time
i
had
thoroughly
convinced
my
audience
and
myself
and
we
looked
upon
these
things
as
completed
books
the
atmosphere
was
charged
with
the
spirit
of
high
endeavour
of
wonderful
accomplishment
i
heard
the
englishman
breathing
deeply
and
through
the
dusk
i
was
aware
of
the
eyes
of
monica
the
wide
vague
eyes
of
a
young
girl
in
which
youth
can
find
exactly
what
it
pleases
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
great
once
or
twice
in
our
lives
and
that
night
i
was
wise
enough
to
depart
before
the
inevitable
at
the
gate
the
englishman
pressed
me
warmly
by
the
hand
and
begged
me
to
honour
his
house
with
my
presence
again
his
wife
echoed
the
wish
and
monica
looked
at
me
with
those
vacant
eyes
that
but
a
few
years
ago
i
would
have
charged
with
the
wine
of
my
song
as
i
stood
in
the
tram
on
my
way
back
to
brussels
i
felt
like
a
man
recovering
from
a
terrible
debauch
and
i
knew
that
the
brief
hour
of
my
pride
was
over
to
return
perhaps
no
more
work
was
impossible
to
a
man
who
had
expressed
considerably
more
than
he
had
to
express
so
i
went
into
a
café
where
there
was
a
string
band
to
play
sentimental
music
over
the
corpse
of
my
genius
chance
took
me
to
a
table
presided
over
by
a
waiter
i
singularly
detested
and
the
last
embers
of
my
greatness
enabled
me
to
order
my
drink
in
a
voice
so
passionate
that
he
looked
at
me
aghast
and
fled
by
the
time
he
returned
with
my
hock
the
tale
was
finished
and
i
tried
to
buy
his
toleration
with
an
enormous
no
i
will
return
to
that
house
on
the
hill
above
woluwe
no
more
not
even
to
see
monica
standing
on
tiptoe
to
pick
her
roses
for
i
have
left
a
giant
robe
hanging
on
a
peg
in
the
hall
and
i
would
not
have
those
amiable
people
see
how
utterly
incapable
i
am
of
filling
it
under
normal
conditions
i
feel
besides
a
kind
of
sentimental
tenderness
for
this
illusion
fated
to
have
so
short
a
life
i
am
no
herod
to
slaughter
babies
and
it
pleases
me
to
think
that
it
lingers
yet
in
that
delightful
house
with
the
books
and
the
old
furniture
and
monica
even
though
i
myself
shall
probably
never
see
it
again
even
though
the
englishman
watches
the
publishers
announcements
for
the
masterpieces
that
will
never
appear
a
wet
day
as
we
grow
older
it
becomes
more
and
more
apparent
that
our
moments
are
the
ghosts
of
old
moments
our
days
but
pale
repetitions
of
days
that
we
have
known
in
the
past
it
might
almost
be
said
that
after
a
certain
age
we
never
meet
a
stranger
or
win
to
a
new
place
the
palace
of
our
soul
grown
larger
let
us
hope
with
the
years
is
haunted
by
little
memories
that
creep
out
of
corners
to
peep
at
us
wistfully
when
we
are
most
sure
that
we
are
alone
sometimes
we
can
not
hear
the
voice
of
the
present
for
the
whisperings
of
the
past
sometimes
the
room
is
so
full
of
ghosts
that
we
can
hardly
breathe
and
yet
it
is
often
difficult
to
find
the
significance
of
these
dead
days
restored
to
us
to
disturb
our
sense
of
passing
time
why
have
our
minds
kept
secret
these
trivial
records
so
many
years
to
give
them
to
us
at
last
when
they
have
no
apparent
consequence
perhaps
it
is
only
that
we
are
not
clever
enough
to
read
the
riddle
perhaps
these
trifles
that
we
have
remembered
unconsciously
year
after
year
are
in
truth
the
tremendous
forces
that
have
made
our
lives
what
they
are
standing
at
the
window
this
morning
and
watching
the
rain
i
suddenly
became
conscious
of
a
wet
morning
long
ago
when
i
stood
as
i
stood
now
and
saw
the
drops
sliding
one
after
another
down
the
steamy
panes
i
was
a
boy
of
eight
years
old
dressed
in
a
sailor
suit
and
with
my
hair
clipped
quite
short
like
a
french
boy
and
my
right
knee
was
stiff
with
a
cut
where
i
had
fallen
on
the
gravel
path
under
the
schoolroom
window
it
was
a
really
wet
grey
day
i
could
hear
the
rain
dripping
from
the
on
to
the
scullery
roof
and
every
now
and
then
a
gust
of
wind
drove
the
rain
down
on
the
soaked
lawn
with
a
noise
like
breaking
surf
i
could
hear
the
water
gurgling
in
the
pipe
that
was
hidden
by
the
ivy
and
i
saw
with
interest
that
one
of
the
paths
was
flooded
so
that
a
canal
ran
between
the
standard
rose
bushes
and
recalled
pictures
of
venice
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
if
it
rained
truly
hard
and
flooded
the
house
so
that
we
should
all
have
to
starve
for
three
weeks
and
then
be
rescued
excitingly
in
boats
but
i
had
not
really
any
hope
behind
me
in
the
schoolroom
my
two
brothers
were
playing
chess
but
had
not
yet
started
quarrelling
and
in
a
corner
my
little
sister
was
patiently
beating
a
doll
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
but
it
was
one
of
those
sombre
smoky
fires
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
take
any
interest
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
very
slowly
and
i
realised
that
an
eternity
of
these
long
seconds
separated
me
from
i
thought
i
would
like
to
go
out
the
enterprise
presented
certain
difficulties
and
dangers
but
none
that
could
not
be
surpassed
i
would
have
to
steal
down
to
the
hall
and
get
my
boots
and
waterproof
on
unobserved
i
would
have
to
open
the
front
door
without
making
too
much
noise
for
the
other
doors
were
well
guarded
by
underlings
and
i
would
have
to
run
down
the
front
drive
under
the
eyes
of
many
windows
once
beyond
the
gate
i
would
be
safe
for
the
wetness
of
the
day
would
secure
me
from
dangerous
encounters
walking
in
the
rain
would
be
pleasant
than
staying
in
the
dull
schoolroom
where
life
remained
unchanged
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
and
i
remembered
that
there
was
a
little
wood
near
our
house
in
which
i
had
never
been
when
it
was
raining
hard
perhaps
i
would
meet
the
magician
for
whom
i
had
looked
so
often
in
vain
on
sunny
days
for
it
was
quite
likely
that
he
preferred
walking
in
bad
weather
when
no
one
else
was
about
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
the
drops
of
rain
falling
on
the
roof
of
the
trees
and
to
be
quite
warm
and
dry
underneath
perhaps
the
magician
would
give
me
a
magic
wand
and
i
would
do
things
like
the
conjurer
last
christmas
certainly
i
would
be
punished
when
i
got
home
for
even
if
i
were
not
missed
they
would
see
that
my
boots
were
muddy
and
that
my
waterproof
was
wet
i
would
have
no
pudding
for
dinner
and
be
sent
to
bed
in
the
afternoon
but
these
things
had
happened
to
me
before
and
though
i
had
not
liked
them
at
the
time
they
did
not
seem
very
terrible
in
retrospect
and
life
was
so
dull
in
the
schoolroom
that
wet
morning
when
i
was
eight
years
old
and
yet
i
did
not
go
out
but
stood
hesitating
at
the
window
while
with
every
gust
earth
seemed
to
fling
back
its
curls
of
rain
from
its
shining
forehead
to
stand
on
the
brink
of
adventure
is
interesting
in
itself
and
now
that
i
could
think
over
the
details
of
my
expedition
was
no
longer
bored
so
i
stayed
dreaming
till
the
golden
moment
for
action
was
passed
and
a
violent
exclamation
from
one
of
the
called
me
back
to
a
prosaic
world
in
a
second
the
board
was
overturned
and
the
players
were
locked
in
battle
my
little
sister
who
had
already
the
feminine
craving
for
tidiness
crept
out
of
her
corner
and
meekly
gathered
the
chessmen
from
under
the
feet
of
the
combatants
i
had
seen
it
all
before
and
while
i
led
my
forces
to
the
aid
of
the
brother
with
whom
at
the
moment
i
had
some
sort
of
alliance
i
reflected
that
i
would
have
done
better
to
dare
the
adventure
and
set
forth
into
the
rainy
world
and
this
morning
when
i
stood
at
my
window
and
my
memory
a
little
cruelly
restored
to
this
vision
of
a
day
long
dead
i
was
still
of
the
same
opinion
oh
i
should
have
put
on
my
boots
and
my
waterproof
and
gone
down
to
the
little
wood
to
meet
the
enchanter
he
would
have
given
me
the
cap
of
invisibility
the
purse
of
fortunatus
and
a
pair
of
boots
he
would
have
taught
me
to
conquer
worlds
and
to
leave
the
easy
triumphs
of
dreamers
to
madmen
philosophers
and
poets
he
would
have
made
me
a
man
of
action
a
statesman
a
soldier
a
founder
of
cities
or
a
digger
of
graves
for
there
are
two
kinds
of
men
in
the
world
when
we
have
put
aside
the
minor
distinctions
of
shape
and
colour
there
are
the
men
who
do
things
and
the
men
who
dream
about
them
no
man
can
be
both
a
dreamer
and
a
man
of
action
and
we
are
called
upon
to
determine
what
rôle
we
shall
play
in
life
when
we
are
too
young
to
know
what
to
do
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
a
mere
wantonness
of
memory
that
preserved
the
image
of
that
hour
with
such
affectionate
detail
where
so
many
brighter
and
more
eventful
hours
have
disappeared
for
ever
it
seems
to
me
likely
enough
that
that
moment
of
hesitation
before
the
schoolroom
window
determined
a
habit
of
mind
that
has
kept
me
dreaming
ever
since
for
all
my
life
i
have
preferred
thought
to
action
i
have
never
run
to
the
little
wood
i
have
never
met
the
enchanter
and
so
this
morning
when
fate
played
me
this
trick
and
my
dream
was
chilled
for
an
instant
by
the
icy
breath
of
the
past
i
did
not
rush
out
into
the
streets
of
life
and
lay
about
me
with
a
flaming
sword
no
i
picked
up
my
pen
and
wrote
some
words
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
lulled
my
shocked
senses
with
the
tranquillity
of
the
idlest
dream
of
all
