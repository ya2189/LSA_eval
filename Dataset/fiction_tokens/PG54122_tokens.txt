squire
arden
chapter
i
up
to
this
time
it
had
been
clare
who
had
made
herself
anxious
about
her
brother
worrying
herself
over
his
ways
and
his
words
and
all
the
ceaseless
turns
of
thought
and
expression
and
perplexing
spontaneousness
which
made
him
so
unlike
the
ardens
and
edgar
had
been
conscious
of
her
anxiety
with
a
sense
of
amusement
rather
than
of
any
other
feeling
but
now
that
their
positions
were
reversed
and
that
it
was
he
who
was
anxious
about
clare
the
matter
was
a
great
deal
more
serious
edgar
arden
felt
but
lightly
the
slights
or
the
censures
of
fortune
he
was
not
specially
concerned
about
himself
nor
prone
to
consider
unless
on
the
strongest
provocation
what
people
thought
of
him
or
if
he
was
taking
the
best
way
to
obtain
their
suffrage
but
this
easy
mind
which
clare
sometimes
took
as
a
sign
of
levity
of
disposition
forsook
him
completely
when
his
own
duties
were
in
question
he
took
them
not
lightly
but
seriously
as
fazakerley
and
perfitt
the
steward
and
everybody
connected
with
the
estate
already
knew
and
not
even
the
estate
was
so
important
as
clare
he
asked
himself
with
a
puzzled
sense
of
ignorance
and
incapacity
what
in
such
circumstances
a
brother
ought
to
do
he
had
all
the
theories
of
a
young
man
against
any
restraint
or
contradiction
of
the
affections
but
held
them
much
more
strongly
than
most
young
men
who
it
must
be
admitted
are
apt
to
see
very
clearly
the
necessity
of
interference
in
the
love
affairs
of
their
sisters
however
much
they
may
dislike
it
in
their
own
edgar
had
no
family
training
to
help
him
and
he
was
aware
that
english
habits
in
such
matters
were
different
from
those
foreign
habits
which
were
the
only
ones
with
which
he
had
any
acquaintance
and
which
transferred
all
power
in
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
parents
poor
clare
who
had
no
mother
to
sympathise
with
her
no
father
to
guide
her
was
it
not
his
business
to
be
doubly
careful
of
all
her
wishes
to
watch
over
her
with
double
anxiety
and
anticipate
everything
she
would
have
him
to
do
but
then
supposing
she
should
wish
to
marry
this
landless
and
not
very
virtuous
cousin
this
man
whose
prospects
were
naught
whose
character
was
so
unsatisfactory
and
with
whom
he
himself
had
so
little
sympathy
would
it
be
right
to
let
her
do
it
should
he
acquiesce
simply
without
a
word
should
he
remonstrate
should
he
speak
of
it
to
her
or
should
he
wait
until
she
had
first
consulted
him
edgar
found
it
very
hard
to
answer
these
questions
he
took
to
watching
his
sister
and
her
manner
to
arthur
arden
her
ways
and
her
looks
and
every
passing
indication
and
got
hopelessly
bewildered
as
was
natural
in
that
maze
of
fluctuating
evidence
which
sometimes
seemed
to
him
to
go
dead
against
and
sometimes
to
be
entirely
in
favour
of
his
cousin
for
clare
did
not
let
herself
go
easily
down
that
dangerous
slope
she
stopped
herself
now
and
then
and
became
utterly
repellant
to
arthur
now
and
then
she
relapsed
into
softness
sometimes
she
would
ask
wonderingly
when
he
meant
to
go
he
to
stay
on
at
arden
for
ever
did
you
ask
him
to
stay
as
long
as
he
liked
she
would
say
with
a
frown
on
her
brow
expending
upon
her
innocent
brother
the
excitement
and
restless
agitation
of
her
own
mind
you
like
him
to
stay
as
long
as
he
wished
edgar
asked
on
one
of
these
occasions
with
a
look
which
he
tried
hard
not
to
make
too
anxious
think
we
were
far
happier
before
anybody
came
clare
answered
with
curious
heat
and
a
tone
almost
of
resentment
what
did
it
mean
did
she
want
really
to
get
rid
of
the
visitor
did
she
really
hate
him
as
she
had
once
said
she
did
when
edgar
recollected
that
his
sister
had
said
so
and
that
arthur
arden
had
confirmed
it
he
was
quite
staggered
and
thus
june
ran
on
amid
difficulties
which
much
confused
the
relations
between
the
brother
and
sister
lord
newmarch
too
left
traces
of
himself
in
the
field
he
had
started
a
correspondence
with
both
according
to
his
opportunities
that
is
he
wrote
long
letters
to
edgar
upon
the
state
of
the
political
world
and
sent
messages
and
to
miss
arden
who
sent
him
messages
in
return
if
she
was
to
marry
either
of
them
surely
lord
newmarch
was
the
more
appropriate
of
the
two
he
was
younger
as
well
as
richer
and
though
he
was
a
prig
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
good
man
he
was
as
well
as
my
lord
and
alas
it
was
quite
uncertain
whether
arthur
arden
was
poor
edgar
felt
like
an
anxious
mother
and
laughed
at
himself
but
could
not
mend
it
until
at
last
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
best
way
was
to
ask
advice
accordingly
he
set
out
very
solemnly
one
day
about
the
end
of
june
to
consult
his
chief
authorities
he
meant
to
conceal
his
personal
trouble
under
the
guise
of
a
fable
he
would
ask
mr
fielding
what
a
brother
in
the
abstract
ought
to
do
in
such
a
position
and
he
would
ask
miss
somers
miss
somers
was
not
a
very
wise
counsellor
but
no
doubt
her
brother
must
have
interfered
in
her
affairs
one
time
at
least
and
she
would
have
some
practical
knowledge
he
went
to
lay
his
case
before
them
with
a
little
trepidation
wondering
whether
they
would
find
him
out
at
all
and
what
they
would
say
somers
probably
would
have
been
the
best
counsellor
of
all
but
edgar
had
no
confidence
nor
pleasure
in
the
doctor
since
their
last
interview
so
he
chose
mr
fielding
in
his
study
and
miss
somers
on
her
sofa
two
people
whose
lives
had
not
come
to
much
but
surely
they
were
old
enough
to
know
mr
fielding
was
in
his
study
writing
his
sermon
it
was
the
day
after
one
of
his
grand
discussions
with
the
doctor
and
the
good
man
was
excited
he
was
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
a
polemical
sermon
culling
little
bits
out
of
the
polemical
sermons
which
had
gone
before
but
combining
them
so
with
links
of
the
new
that
his
adversary
might
not
perceive
the
antiquity
of
some
of
his
arguments
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
lay
down
his
pen
and
clear
his
mind
from
the
fumes
of
controversy
am
very
glad
to
see
you
edgar
he
said
find
me
in
the
midst
of
my
troubles
young
denbigh
you
know
ought
to
take
the
preaching
more
than
he
does
but
i
have
no
confidence
in
him
in
a
doctrinal
point
of
view
he
would
be
bringing
up
some
of
the
new
notions
and
setting
our
good
folks
by
the
ears
though
it
is
rather
hard
upon
me
to
preach
so
often
you
are
the
best
able
to
instruct
us
sir
said
edgar
who
to
tell
the
truth
did
not
often
derive
a
great
deal
of
instruction
from
good
little
sermons
and
then
the
excellent
rector
coughed
modestly
and
blushed
a
little
and
put
his
paper
away
from
him
with
a
gently
deprecating
air
suppose
when
one
lives
to
be
seventy
one
must
have
learned
a
little
if
one
has
made
a
right
start
he
said
least
i
hope
so
edgar
i
hope
so
though
some
of
us
unfortunately
the
thing
that
startles
me
is
that
somers
should
take
the
calvinist
view
i
would
not
judge
him
i
would
be
indeed
the
very
last
to
judge
any
one
but
how
a
man
who
has
lived
on
the
whole
rather
a
careless
sort
of
life
not
culpable
i
say
that
but
careless
as
indeed
the
best
of
us
are
should
stand
up
for
hell
and
torture
and
all
that
is
more
than
i
can
guess
if
he
had
taken
another
view
more
lax
instead
of
more
strict
you
think
he
cares
at
all
said
edgar
still
under
the
prejudice
of
his
last
interview
bless
us
yes
surely
he
must
care
you
think
he
cares
edgar
why
then
he
must
be
sniggering
in
his
sleeve
at
me
no
no
my
dear
boy
of
course
he
must
be
in
earnest
no
man
could
be
such
a
humbug
as
that
but
if
it
was
murray
who
is
scotch
it
would
seem
more
natural
i
hear
she
was
in
church
on
sunday
looking
very
serious
but
bless
me
edgar
you
are
very
serious
too
is
there
anything
wrong
with
clare
is
nothing
wrong
with
anybody
said
edgar
fact
is
i
want
your
advice
at
least
it
is
not
i
that
want
it
but
a
very
intimate
friend
of
mine
he
has
got
a
sister
just
like
me
very
pretty
and
all
that
but
he
does
not
know
what
to
do
his
sister
asked
mr
fielding
with
a
smile
does
he
want
to
do
i
tell
you
there
was
some
one
who
wanted
to
marry
her
said
edgar
to
be
sure
that
was
it
somebody
i
he
approve
of
not
a
proper
match
and
he
know
what
to
do
whether
to
speak
to
her
or
to
wait
till
she
speaks
or
whether
he
has
any
right
to
interfere
he
is
not
her
father
of
course
only
her
brother
and
he
is
in
an
utter
muddle
what
to
do
and
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
said
edgar
with
a
little
hysterical
laugh
which
sounded
like
a
giggle
has
asked
that
was
a
very
curious
choice
though
the
circumstances
so
much
resemble
your
own
said
the
rector
with
a
smile
do
you
think
you
would
do
if
it
were
clare
is
just
the
question
i
have
been
asking
myself
said
edgar
embarrassed
for
the
mere
sake
of
argument
that
it
was
clare
i
have
not
the
remotest
conception
what
i
should
such
a
suitor
as
arthur
arden
for
instance
edgar
never
try
to
take
in
anybody
for
you
can
not
do
it
i
feel
for
you
sincerely
stop
said
edgar
never
said
arthur
arden
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
never
implied
have
been
perfectly
wary
and
prudent
said
mr
fielding
i
knew
arthur
arden
long
before
you
did
and
i
am
quite
sure
he
means
to
mend
his
fortune
if
he
can
by
means
of
clare
i
knew
it
before
you
did
edgar
and
that
was
why
i
was
so
grieved
to
see
him
here
now
you
know
it
my
dear
boy
send
him
did
not
you
warn
me
if
you
knew
asked
edgar
surprised
was
the
good
he
might
have
changed
his
mind
or
you
might
have
thought
me
mistaken
and
i
did
not
know
feelings
or
even
yours
edgar
if
you
had
liked
him
for
instance
but
my
dear
fellow
now
you
have
found
it
out
send
him
know
as
little
about
feelings
as
you
do
said
edgar
almost
sullenly
feeling
that
this
was
really
no
solution
of
his
difficulties
i
suppose
is
the
chief
person
to
be
consulted
should
i
speak
to
her
should
i
bring
matters
to
a
conclusion
perhaps
it
might
come
to
nothing
if
they
were
let
my
advice
to
you
is
to
make
short
work
said
the
rector
solemnly
send
him
is
very
easy
to
say
said
edgar
it
takes
more
trouble
in
the
doing
what
my
nearest
relative
my
heir
if
i
die
how
can
i
turn
him
out
of
the
house
which
is
almost
as
much
his
as
mine
so
long
as
i
am
unmarried
which
i
am
likely
to
be
for
some
time
he
is
my
you
like
him
said
the
rector
was
what
i
feared
of
course
if
you
like
him
and
clare
likes
him
nobody
has
any
right
to
say
a
i
never
said
i
liked
him
said
edgar
pettishly
love
nor
hatred
seems
necessary
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
but
could
not
something
be
done
that
would
be
just
without
being
disagreeable
i
like
to
treat
him
badly
and
yet
the
rector
shook
his
head
think
i
would
have
courage
of
mind
to
do
what
i
advise
he
said
is
too
old
for
clare
and
he
has
not
a
good
character
which
is
a
great
deal
worse
he
will
make
love
to
her
one
day
and
then
the
next
he
will
come
down
to
the
village
faugh
i
like
to
soil
my
lips
with
talking
of
such
things
he
is
not
a
good
man
i
love
clare
like
my
own
child
and
i
would
fight
to
the
last
before
i
would
give
her
to
that
man
he
ought
never
to
have
come
here
edgar
never
anything
happen
when
he
was
here
before
do
you
know
anything
said
edgar
eagerly
is
your
enemy
my
dear
boy
he
is
your
enemy
said
mr
fielding
and
that
was
all
that
could
be
elicited
from
him
edgar
remembered
that
clare
had
used
the
very
same
words
and
it
did
not
make
him
more
comfortable
but
yet
an
enemy
to
himself
was
of
so
very
much
less
importance
in
short
it
mattered
next
to
nothing
he
smiled
and
tried
to
persuade
mr
fielding
that
it
was
so
but
produced
no
result
him
was
all
the
rector
would
say
and
it
was
so
easy
for
one
who
had
not
got
it
to
do
to
give
such
advice
to
edgar
who
was
a
man
incapable
of
sending
any
stranger
away
who
claimed
his
hospitality
and
whose
sense
of
that
virtue
was
as
keen
as
an
he
would
have
taken
in
the
worst
of
enemies
had
he
wanted
shelter
with
a
foolish
young
highminded
scorn
of
any
danger
danger
let
the
fellow
do
his
worst
let
him
put
forth
all
the
powers
he
had
at
his
command
edgar
was
not
afraid
but
then
when
clare
was
in
question
the
importance
of
the
matter
increased
in
a
moment
tenfold
and
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
chapter
ii
from
mr
fielding
edgar
went
to
miss
somers
to
whom
he
told
his
story
under
the
same
disguise
but
who
unlike
the
rector
believed
him
undoubtingly
and
gave
him
her
best
sympathy
but
not
much
enlightenment
as
may
be
supposed
and
he
returned
to
arden
very
little
the
wiser
asking
himself
still
the
same
question
what
should
he
do
must
he
go
home
and
be
patient
and
look
on
while
arthur
arden
quite
unmolested
and
at
his
ease
laid
snares
and
toils
for
clare
clare
had
no
warning
no
preparation
no
defence
against
these
skilful
and
elaborate
plots
she
might
fall
into
the
net
at
any
moment
and
was
it
possible
that
her
duty
in
the
matter
was
to
sit
still
and
look
on
would
not
his
very
silence
and
passive
attitude
embolden
and
encourage
the
suitor
would
it
not
appear
like
a
tacit
consent
to
his
plans
and
hopes
he
was
walking
up
the
avenue
while
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
when
all
at
once
there
came
to
edgar
a
suggestion
which
cleared
his
whole
firmament
i
call
it
a
suggestion
because
i
do
not
understand
any
more
than
he
himself
did
how
it
happened
that
all
at
once
being
in
utter
darkness
he
should
see
light
and
perceive
in
a
moment
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
if
some
unseen
spirit
had
whispered
it
all
at
once
in
his
ear
it
could
not
have
been
more
vivid
or
more
sudden
must
go
to
town
edgar
said
to
himself
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
town
nor
had
the
idea
occurred
to
him
before
but
the
moment
it
came
to
him
he
perceived
that
this
was
the
thing
to
do
arthur
could
not
stay
when
he
was
gone
indeed
to
take
him
away
from
clare
he
did
not
object
to
his
company
in
london
fellow
after
all
i
have
the
sweet
and
he
has
the
bitter
edgar
thought
and
to
share
his
purse
with
his
kinsman
was
the
easiest
matter
so
long
as
the
kinsman
did
not
object
after
he
had
made
this
sudden
decision
his
heart
sat
lightly
in
his
breast
and
everything
brightened
up
he
even
grew
conceited
the
simple
fellow
thinking
on
the
whole
it
was
so
very
clever
of
him
to
have
thought
of
so
beautiful
and
simple
a
solution
to
all
his
troubles
though
as
i
have
said
he
did
not
think
of
it
at
all
but
had
it
simply
thrown
into
his
mind
without
any
exertion
of
his
have
taken
a
great
resolution
he
said
that
evening
after
dinner
before
clare
left
the
table
have
made
up
my
mind
to
take
the
advice
of
all
my
good
friends
and
to
betake
myself
to
town
said
clare
and
arthur
in
a
breath
she
with
simple
astonishment
he
with
dismay
town
edgar
but
i
thought
you
hated
town
added
clare
know
anything
about
it
i
love
it
he
said
one
must
not
always
mind
that
there
is
newmarch
who
writes
me
and
why
there
are
the
thornleighs
with
such
inducements
you
think
it
is
worth
a
while
to
go
thornleighs
oh
they
are
cheap
enough
you
will
meet
them
everywhere
said
arthur
with
a
sneer
that
is
all
you
go
to
town
for
thornleighs
said
clare
and
she
made
a
rapid
feminine
calculation
and
decided
that
though
it
was
very
sudden
it
must
be
gussy
and
that
a
new
mistress
to
arden
was
inevitable
it
did
not
strike
her
so
painfully
as
it
might
have
done
in
the
tumult
of
her
personal
thoughts
will
be
strange
to
you
she
said
then
you
are
so
fond
of
the
country
and
have
to
make
acquaintance
with
everything
you
think
edgar
might
wait
might
wait
said
edgar
laughing
but
he
kept
firm
to
his
proposal
i
must
go
as
soon
as
it
is
practicable
he
said
to
arthur
when
they
were
alone
have
got
to
make
acquaintance
with
my
own
country
i
know
london
any
more
than
i
know
constantinople
i
have
been
in
it
and
gazed
at
it
but
that
is
all
and
newmarch
is
a
very
sensible
fellow
he
added
abruptly
the
way
arden
what
do
you
say
to
coming
with
me
you
might
share
my
rooms
if
you
have
not
any
pressing
engagements
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
said
arthur
course
i
should
rather
have
stayed
here
i
need
not
tell
you
that
after
all
i
have
told
you
arden
is
to
me
the
most
captivating
place
in
england
but
if
you
are
going
of
course
i
must
go
and
he
sighed
a
profound
sigh
course
said
edgar
with
quiet
calmness
and
then
there
was
an
uncomfortable
pause
is
what
i
object
to
said
arthur
arden
give
me
to
understand
you
interfere
and
then
you
as
good
as
turn
me
out
of
the
house
by
going
away
yourself
by
jove
i
believe
that
is
the
reason
why
you
think
i
am
to
give
up
all
control
over
my
movements
because
you
happen
to
be
in
the
house
said
edgar
with
a
laugh
arden
that
will
never
do
and
i
never
said
i
would
not
interfere
it
might
be
my
duty
i
am
brother
and
the
head
of
the
can
take
care
of
herself
and
so
can
the
house
fancy
am
all
it
has
for
a
head
said
edgar
keeping
his
temper
with
an
effort
this
is
very
unprofitable
sort
of
and
then
there
was
a
gloomy
pause
all
conversation
being
arrested
arthur
arden
had
been
making
he
thought
considerable
progress
with
clare
which
was
a
thing
that
made
brother
much
less
important
she
and
old
arden
seemed
almost
within
reach
of
his
hand
and
what
should
he
care
for
the
hall
and
the
squire
if
he
were
arden
of
old
arden
with
a
beautiful
wife
but
to
be
thus
sent
away
at
the
most
critical
moment
arthur
was
sullen
and
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
conceal
it
he
asked
himself
should
he
risk
the
final
effort
should
he
put
it
to
the
test
and
know
at
once
what
his
fortune
was
to
be
in
which
case
he
might
scorn
the
spurious
arden
and
all
his
efforts
or
should
he
be
wary
and
flatter
him
and
wait
he
had
not
yet
resolved
the
question
when
they
joined
clare
on
the
terrace
which
was
her
summer
but
mind
was
not
relieved
by
seeing
the
lady
of
his
hopes
take
her
arm
and
lead
him
away
along
the
front
of
the
house
talking
to
him
anything
happened
that
makes
you
want
to
go
clare
asked
you
heard
anything
have
you
had
any
letter
is
it
about
gussy
i
am
the
only
one
that
has
a
right
to
know
edgar
you
might
tell
you
what
you
are
going
to
town
there
must
be
some
reason
i
am
sure
it
is
not
caprice
edgar
you
know
i
care
for
everything
that
concerns
you
but
you
speak
as
if
your
affairs
were
of
no
consequence
as
if
they
were
nothing
to
am
not
so
ungrateful
nor
so
silly
said
edgar
look
here
i
tell
you
why
going
clare
and
yet
i
am
going
for
a
good
reason
which
is
quite
satisfactory
to
myself
can
you
allow
me
as
much
private
judgment
as
that
course
your
private
judgment
is
all
in
all
said
clare
affronted
could
any
one
attempt
to
dictate
to
you
but
one
might
wish
to
know
without
thrusting
in
opinion
tell
me
only
this
one
thing
edgar
is
it
about
gussy
thornleigh
edgar
laughed
in
the
fulness
of
his
innocence
more
about
gussy
thornleigh
than
about
said
clare
are
quite
sure
if
it
is
business
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
i
hope
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
think
of
interfering
with
business
but
i
do
feel
so
concerned
so
anxious
edgar
dear
about
what
said
edgar
meeting
her
troubled
look
with
his
habitual
smile
your
wife
said
clare
solemnly
she
only
shook
her
head
when
he
laughed
disturbing
all
the
quiet
echoes
yes
you
may
laugh
she
said
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
i
assure
you
our
cousin
thinks
so
edgar
made
a
profane
exclamation
am
infinitely
obliged
to
him
i
am
sure
he
said
after
the
objectionable
words
had
escaped
his
lips
cousin
thinks
so
too
what
was
between
these
two
who
ought
to
be
everything
to
each
other
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
with
a
softening
sense
of
that
comic
element
which
runs
through
human
nature
that
while
arthur
arden
so
kindly
interested
himself
in
his
hypothetical
interests
he
on
his
side
was
taking
a
good
deal
of
trouble
wholly
and
solely
on
account
his
kinsman
was
not
aware
how
much
he
was
influenced
by
this
consideration
and
the
thought
of
this
mutual
regard
amused
edgar
even
in
the
midst
of
his
displeasure
all
take
an
interest
in
each
other
he
said
laughing
half
jestingly
yet
with
a
sense
of
fun
which
was
very
odd
to
clare
and
then
she
went
all
unconscious
to
her
little
table
and
sat
down
and
took
her
work
she
did
not
work
very
much
her
hands
being
full
of
things
more
important
the
affairs
of
the
parish
and
estate
but
to
her
as
to
most
other
women
it
was
a
welcome
occasional
refuge
it
was
true
quite
true
that
she
was
anxious
about
wife
and
ready
to
believe
in
the
attractions
of
gussy
thornleigh
or
any
one
else
who
came
in
his
way
but
other
feelings
confused
her
mind
at
the
same
time
when
edgar
went
away
of
course
arthur
must
go
also
and
arthur
had
managed
to
twine
himself
up
with
her
life
in
the
strangest
subtle
way
how
should
she
bear
the
blank
when
they
were
gone
it
would
be
like
the
time
before
return
the
silent
days
when
she
was
alone
in
arden
but
these
days
had
not
been
quickened
by
any
new
touch
of
life
as
the
present
time
had
been
and
it
made
her
shudder
to
think
how
such
grey
days
would
look
when
they
came
back
is
fatal
news
to
me
said
arthur
softly
sitting
down
opposite
to
her
thought
i
might
have
stayed
here
at
arden
and
for
once
kept
out
of
the
racket
of
thought
you
liked
town
said
clare
i
thought
my
brother
hated
it
i
must
have
been
mistaken
in
not
be
so
hard
upon
me
i
have
liked
town
more
than
i
ought
when
there
are
a
good
many
things
in
a
life
that
he
is
very
glad
to
forget
and
not
many
that
are
much
pleasure
to
think
of
town
is
a
resource
to
him
but
when
there
comes
a
balmy
time
like
this
when
it
almost
looks
as
if
the
gates
of
heaven
might
open
once
in
a
way
are
very
poetical
said
clare
forcing
herself
to
smile
though
her
heart
began
to
flutter
and
beat
with
the
sense
of
something
more
to
come
i
he
said
and
then
began
to
mutter
between
his
teeth
the
first
line
faintly
the
second
more
audible
maud
were
all
that
she
seemed
and
her
smile
were
all
that
i
deemed
then
this
world
were
not
so
bitter
but
a
smile
might
make
it
clare
heard
but
she
did
not
smile
she
kept
her
eyes
on
her
work
and
her
lips
shut
close
and
after
he
had
discharged
this
little
arrow
he
sat
and
looked
at
her
and
wondered
she
gave
him
no
encouragement
not
the
least
she
would
not
even
let
it
be
apparent
that
she
understood
or
that
there
was
any
meaning
whatever
perceptible
to
her
in
what
he
said
the
only
thing
that
could
give
him
any
hope
was
a
subdued
consciousness
about
her
a
thrill
of
suppressed
excitement
something
which
made
her
fix
her
eyes
upon
her
work
and
restrain
her
breath
arthur
saw
this
and
it
made
his
heart
beat
she
was
expectant
waiting
for
other
words
which
she
foresaw
were
coming
words
which
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
be
allowed
to
speak
for
one
moment
he
hesitated
and
had
almost
gone
on
but
again
a
cold
dread
came
over
him
was
it
according
to
nature
that
a
proud
girl
like
clare
should
thus
wait
for
her
declaration
if
she
meant
to
answer
it
favourably
was
it
not
a
stately
reluctant
kindness
on
her
part
to
get
over
a
crisis
which
she
felt
to
be
coming
and
spare
him
as
much
pain
as
possible
he
shrank
back
into
himself
with
a
sense
of
suffering
greater
than
he
could
have
considered
possible
when
this
idea
took
possession
of
him
would
she
have
given
him
this
gracious
opportunity
waited
for
him
in
such
stillness
and
consciousness
had
any
word
but
been
on
her
lips
he
did
not
think
that
clare
felt
herself
like
a
sovereign
princess
one
whom
men
dare
not
woo
unless
when
signs
and
tokens
to
justify
the
daring
are
supplied
she
sat
motionless
expecting
meaning
to
give
him
courage
and
he
took
from
this
indication
of
royal
readiness
to
listen
only
an
intimation
of
despair
it
is
fatal
news
to
me
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
and
he
got
up
and
stood
over
her
reluctant
to
go
too
unhappy
to
stay
shall
i
see
arden
again
i
wonder
and
what
will
have
become
of
us
all
by
that
time
he
added
taking
momentary
courage
but
just
then
edgar
came
up
to
them
and
it
was
too
late
chapter
iii
thoughts
had
travelled
very
far
during
arthur
visit
at
the
hall
when
he
arrived
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
endure
him
to
have
as
little
to
say
to
him
as
possible
to
watch
anxiously
all
his
relations
with
her
brother
and
keep
all
her
wits
about
her
to
counteract
his
schemes
against
edgar
if
he
had
any
but
all
these
original
intentions
had
floated
away
from
her
she
could
not
tell
how
the
whole
condition
of
affairs
was
changed
he
had
no
schemes
against
edgar
on
the
contrary
he
heartily
liked
and
thought
well
of
the
strange
generous
soul
who
was
so
very
unlike
all
the
ardens
had
ever
been
and
yet
was
the
head
of
the
ardens
and
master
of
the
family
destiny
arthur
did
not
understand
him
any
more
than
clare
did
but
had
given
in
his
declaration
of
loyalty
and
support
so
that
the
great
obstacle
was
it
the
only
obstacle
between
them
was
swept
away
at
once
and
then
there
had
been
the
doubt
of
her
motives
the
uncertainty
as
to
his
meaning
whether
he
loved
her
for
herself
or
whether
but
this
clare
had
been
very
reluctant
to
think
of
he
had
contemplated
enriching
himself
by
her
means
it
would
have
been
quite
natural
that
he
should
have
done
so
by
means
of
any
other
lady
it
was
not
the
mere
mercenary
pretence
at
love
which
revolted
his
young
kinswoman
but
simply
a
personal
aversion
to
be
herself
the
subject
of
such
a
commercial
transaction
this
dread
had
also
floated
away
how
could
it
withstand
the
influence
of
his
presence
of
his
looks
and
words
and
the
absolute
devotion
he
threw
into
his
manner
towards
her
they
had
been
together
for
long
days
spending
with
little
meetings
and
partings
hours
in
each
society
not
alone
indeed
but
almost
better
than
alone
for
a
skilful
and
experienced
hunter
like
arthur
arden
has
it
in
his
power
to
isolate
his
victim
and
to
make
her
feel
herself
the
one
object
of
interest
the
one
being
in
the
room
and
in
the
world
with
almost
a
more
subtle
certainty
than
could
be
given
by
downright
words
all
this
clare
had
come
through
and
it
had
wrought
a
great
change
upon
her
she
had
been
penetrated
with
arthur
influence
through
and
through
she
had
grown
to
feel
that
everything
she
had
or
anybody
else
had
would
be
better
spent
in
his
service
than
in
any
other
that
it
was
natural
to
devote
her
possessions
to
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
appropriate
what
he
would
this
was
never
breathed
into
words
even
in
her
own
mind
but
it
had
come
to
be
her
fixed
principle
mercenary
how
could
it
be
mercenary
the
world
had
done
him
the
huge
injustice
of
leaving
him
a
born
prince
without
any
due
provision
and
was
it
not
some
duty
every
duty
to
neutralise
that
horrible
injustice
clare
no
longer
thought
of
it
as
a
desire
on
his
part
but
as
a
necessity
on
her
own
and
now
he
must
go
away
as
poor
as
unfriended
as
lonely
as
ever
without
either
money
in
his
purse
or
companion
to
make
his
life
go
easier
she
too
grew
furious
with
edgar
as
she
thought
it
all
over
for
a
caprice
it
must
be
a
caprice
he
said
it
was
not
for
gussy
thornleigh
which
would
have
been
a
feasible
reason
though
frivolous
and
what
then
was
it
for
a
foolish
boyish
fancy
an
inclination
towards
and
the
follies
of
london
society
nothing
more
and
to
risk
two
lives
for
that
to
break
up
all
the
combinations
that
were
daily
growing
into
shape
and
becoming
practicable
all
for
a
vulgar
fancy
to
go
to
town
clare
was
very
angry
with
her
brother
she
thought
more
meanly
of
him
than
she
had
ever
done
before
is
his
education
she
said
to
herself
must
have
been
used
to
all
kinds
of
junketing
as
people
are
abroad
and
he
has
tried
to
get
into
our
quiet
english
ways
without
effect
and
he
feels
he
must
get
back
to
his
natural
element
oh
heavens
brother
this
was
how
poor
edgar
was
judged
in
the
midst
of
his
the
usual
fate
of
those
who
think
more
of
others
than
of
themselves
it
was
not
till
the
very
day
before
her
departure
that
clare
acquired
a
clearer
light
upon
the
subject
she
had
gone
to
visit
miss
somers
which
was
a
duty
she
had
much
neglected
of
late
the
village
too
had
been
neglected
she
could
scarcely
tell
why
have
been
so
busy
she
said
visitors
in
the
house
visitors
are
so
rare
in
arden
one
gets
out
of
the
way
of
them
but
now
edgar
is
going
away
of
course
i
shall
be
quiet
this
she
said
with
a
sigh
but
miss
somers
was
not
quick
enough
at
the
first
moment
to
understand
that
clare
had
sighed
she
was
full
of
other
subjects
and
anxious
for
information
on
her
own
account
edgar
he
is
so
nice
she
said
young
man
you
know
who
must
have
so
many
things
but
just
as
pleased
do
you
know
i
think
he
is
a
little
fond
of
me
clare
of
course
i
mean
anything
but
what
is
right
i
am
old
enough
to
be
and
then
to
think
he
should
ask
in
that
nice
way
fancy
clare
my
advice
if
it
had
been
my
brother
you
know
or
anybody
but
my
advice
edgar
ask
your
advice
said
clare
with
a
smile
and
she
said
to
herself
what
a
deceiver
he
is
he
will
do
anything
to
please
people
as
if
anybody
could
be
the
better
of
miss
advice
was
not
for
himself
my
dear
of
course
it
be
very
i
may
tell
that
friend
of
his
clare
and
the
sister
you
know
and
then
somebody
that
was
fond
of
her
and
what
was
he
to
do
it
was
as
good
as
a
novel
indeed
i
think
it
was
rather
better
you
remember
that
story
where
there
was
oh
my
dear
child
i
am
sure
you
remember
there
was
such
a
sweet
girl
helena
was
her
name
or
no
i
think
it
was
adela
or
something
and
she
had
a
lover
just
the
same
and
then
the
good
brother
in
such
distress
clare
why
do
you
turn
so
red
i
am
sure
you
know
a
brother
and
a
sister
and
a
gentleman
who
loved
her
said
clare
colouring
high
no
i
mean
yes
i
think
i
do
recollect
and
did
you
say
the
brother
wanted
your
advice
this
was
said
in
a
tone
which
chilled
poor
miss
somers
through
and
through
to
her
very
heart
told
him
so
she
said
faltering
course
i
never
pretended
to
set
up
to
be
very
and
how
could
i
give
advice
but
then
the
poor
dear
brother
was
so
and
i
suppose
he
thought
a
lady
you
know
and
old
enough
to
be
or
perhaps
it
was
only
to
please
me
i
told
him
oh
no
never
never
and
i
told
him
some
things
that
were
dear
edgar
was
quite
affected
you
advise
him
to
go
away
asked
clare
with
a
smouldering
fire
in
her
eyes
my
dear
could
i
take
upon
me
to
and
then
he
never
said
anything
about
it
was
the
poor
girl
i
was
thinking
of
i
said
oh
no
never
never
rather
anything
than
that
you
know
what
i
have
said
to
you
so
often
clare
when
a
girl
has
a
disappointment
you
never
can
tell
it
may
be
consumption
or
it
may
be
oh
my
dear
the
unlikeliest
things
bilious
fever
i
have
known
or
even
rheumatism
i
told
dear
edgar
and
he
was
so
nice
he
was
sure
his
friend
would
never
think
and
fancy
dear
of
its
being
advice
must
be
very
flattering
to
you
said
clare
but
she
rose
instantly
and
took
a
very
summary
leave
avoiding
miss
kiss
she
went
home
glowing
with
anger
and
mortified
pride
it
was
but
too
easy
to
see
through
so
simple
a
veil
edgar
who
met
her
on
the
way
home
could
not
understand
her
glowing
cheek
and
angry
eye
he
turned
and
walked
with
her
feeling
quite
concerned
about
his
sister
has
happened
he
said
disagreeable
at
the
village
can
i
set
it
right
for
you
clare
she
said
is
nothing
disagreeable
in
the
village
it
is
much
nearer
than
the
village
edgar
i
have
found
out
why
you
are
going
away
you
are
going
for
my
sake
you
think
i
am
not
able
to
manage
my
own
affairs
to
take
care
of
myself
you
think
so
poorly
of
your
sister
as
that
do
you
mean
he
said
think
anything
that
is
disagreeable
or
distasteful
to
you
you
can
not
believe
it
for
a
moment
is
that
arthur
arden
may
go
she
said
firmly
but
with
flaming
cheeks
and
edgar
looked
at
her
confused
not
knowing
what
to
say
but
after
the
first
moment
he
recovered
himself
think
he
has
paid
us
a
sufficiently
long
visit
i
confess
he
said
think
as
it
can
not
be
his
while
i
live
that
perhaps
he
had
better
not
remain
longer
at
arden
but
why
should
this
be
a
matter
of
offence
to
you
clare
was
silent
her
blush
grew
hotter
her
eyes
were
glowing
still
but
she
faltered
and
drooped
her
head
as
she
went
on
that
was
all
if
you
had
no
other
meaning
edgar
do
you
think
i
am
so
frivolous
so
lightly
moved
so
he
said
seriously
not
let
us
discuss
a
subject
which
has
not
yet
been
put
in
our
way
i
think
of
you
as
the
creature
i
love
best
in
the
world
i
prize
your
happiness
and
comfort
and
welfare
more
than
anything
in
the
world
what
would
you
have
me
say
i
do
not
think
i
am
wronging
any
one
by
going
for
a
few
weeks
to
london
i
neither
reproach
nor
restrain
by
so
simple
a
step
let
us
talk
of
it
any
do
both
said
clare
under
her
breath
but
edgar
was
kind
and
would
not
hear
he
was
sorry
for
her
seeing
her
emotion
and
he
was
half
ashamed
besides
that
his
immaculate
sister
the
princess
whom
everybody
served
and
honoured
should
suffer
herself
to
be
thus
moved
it
gave
him
a
little
pang
to
think
that
anything
connected
with
arthur
arden
or
indeed
with
any
man
could
thus
disturb
her
stately
maidenly
serenity
a
man
may
be
very
respectful
of
love
in
the
abstract
but
the
sight
of
his
sister
in
love
is
a
sight
which
is
not
pleasant
to
him
he
tried
to
shut
it
out
from
himself
by
rushing
hurriedly
into
other
matters
of
conversation
and
did
a
great
deal
of
talking
by
way
of
covering
her
silence
clare
recovered
her
composure
by
degrees
and
then
had
to
recover
from
the
shame
which
followed
and
the
feeling
of
having
betrayed
herself
so
that
monologue
was
of
infinite
value
to
her
though
perhaps
she
was
scarcely
grateful
enough
to
him
for
keeping
it
up
and
it
was
then
that
she
fully
found
out
that
her
brother
who
was
so
weakly
considerate
of
feelings
and
anxious
to
save
everybody
pain
was
nevertheless
very
firm
when
he
thought
it
necessary
and
did
not
give
in
as
many
people
supposed
he
would
be
sure
to
do
this
discovery
had
a
great
effect
upon
his
sister
it
bewildered
her
as
going
entirely
against
her
preconceived
notions
and
it
also
moved
her
to
a
little
alarm
for
she
too
had
supposed
he
would
yield
being
so
tender
of
giving
pain
and
he
had
not
yielded
nor
budged
a
step
and
clare
and
and
proud
as
she
was
grew
frightened
as
she
glanced
with
furtive
eyes
at
her
gentle
brother
who
she
knew
well
would
not
hurt
a
fly
but
if
clare
was
frightened
the
effect
upon
edgar
was
still
more
serious
he
felt
that
his
flight
was
too
late
to
do
any
good
she
loved
this
man
whom
he
thought
so
unworthy
of
her
so
much
older
poorer
less
true
and
good
than
herself
a
man
with
so
many
soils
of
the
world
upon
him
whom
even
edgar
felt
to
possess
experiences
of
which
he
would
rather
know
nothing
but
clare
loved
him
nothing
else
could
account
for
her
agitation
it
was
too
late
to
banish
him
from
the
house
too
late
to
build
up
defences
round
her
the
stronghold
was
gone
quick
mind
jumped
from
that
conclusion
to
an
instant
and
final
summary
of
arthur
character
he
was
a
man
who
might
mend
as
so
many
men
might
mend
if
prosperity
smiled
upon
him
if
he
had
love
and
money
and
an
established
position
he
might
settle
down
as
so
many
have
settled
down
all
his
wild
oats
sown
and
himself
a
most
virtuous
member
of
society
sober
man
among
his
boys
giving
them
the
best
advice
and
example
had
he
been
the
squire
he
would
have
fitted
the
place
beautifully
this
idea
came
to
edgar
in
spite
of
himself
he
would
have
made
an
admirable
squire
and
the
little
process
of
wild
would
have
been
no
social
disadvantage
to
him
even
now
if
he
became
arden
of
old
arden
in
right
of
his
wife
this
was
one
of
the
things
that
annoyed
edgar
but
he
tried
to
look
it
in
the
face
his
sister
had
said
no
more
about
giving
that
possession
up
and
edgar
did
not
find
it
within
the
limits
of
his
powers
to
make
a
proposal
to
her
on
the
subject
and
accordingly
the
chances
were
that
arthur
would
be
arden
of
old
arden
while
edgar
was
only
the
young
squire
it
galled
even
his
sweet
temper
to
think
of
this
transference
but
putting
feeling
aside
and
thinking
only
of
justice
he
did
not
doubt
that
his
cousin
would
mend
he
had
reached
the
age
when
men
often
mend
when
dissipation
becomes
less
sweet
and
reputation
more
dear
and
when
comfort
comes
in
as
a
powerful
auxiliary
to
virtue
to
have
only
such
satisfaction
as
could
be
given
by
these
thoughts
when
he
was
considering
future
husband
and
her
hopes
of
happiness
was
poor
enough
but
still
it
was
better
than
the
thought
that
he
was
giving
her
over
to
the
charge
of
a
man
who
would
ruin
her
and
break
her
heart
the
household
at
arden
was
an
uneasy
one
that
night
the
three
kept
together
making
each
other
uncomfortable
but
with
a
vague
sense
of
safety
in
company
edgar
was
anxious
to
prevent
any
definite
explanation
arthur
was
afraid
to
risk
the
words
he
would
be
sure
to
say
if
clare
and
he
were
alone
and
she
not
knowing
what
she
feared
not
knowing
what
she
wished
afraid
of
her
brother
afraid
of
her
cousin
uncertain
of
herself
kept
between
them
with
such
a
painful
attempt
at
ordinary
talk
as
was
possible
they
were
to
separate
the
two
men
into
the
world
the
woman
into
the
stillness
which
had
been
familiar
to
her
so
long
am
used
to
it
but
it
will
be
different
she
said
almost
pathetically
strong
in
the
presence
of
both
and
feeling
that
what
she
said
could
produce
no
agitating
response
will
be
very
different
for
all
of
us
said
arthur
arden
there
ever
come
days
like
these
again
chapter
iv
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
anything
more
strangely
lonely
and
bleak
than
arden
seemed
to
clare
the
day
after
her
brother
and
cousin
left
it
she
wandered
about
the
vacant
rooms
and
out
upon
the
terrace
and
kept
thinking
that
she
heard
their
voices
and
steps
and
caught
glimpses
of
them
turning
the
corners
but
they
were
gone
edgar
to
come
back
again
shortly
so
that
could
scarcely
be
counted
a
calamity
but
arthur
would
he
come
at
all
would
he
be
years
of
coming
as
he
had
been
before
it
seemed
to
clare
that
it
was
years
instead
of
weeks
since
she
had
dwelt
thus
alone
and
tranquil
waiting
for
return
she
had
been
alone
but
then
her
loneliness
had
seemed
natural
she
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
scarcely
pausing
to
think
that
she
was
different
from
others
or
if
she
ever
did
so
feeling
her
isolation
almost
as
much
a
sign
of
superiority
as
of
anything
less
pleasant
she
was
the
chatelaine
the
one
sole
lady
of
the
land
in
her
soft
maidenly
state
and
the
visits
of
the
kind
friends
who
offered
themselves
on
all
sides
to
come
and
stay
with
her
out
of
pity
for
her
solitude
had
been
more
a
trouble
than
a
pleasure
to
her
but
now
it
seemed
to
clare
that
she
would
be
thankful
for
any
companionship
anything
that
would
free
her
from
her
own
thoughts
she
felt
like
a
boat
which
had
drifted
ashore
like
something
which
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
existence
life
had
gone
away
and
left
her
and
yet
she
was
more
full
of
life
than
she
had
ever
been
before
tingling
to
the
very
finger
points
expecting
hoping
looking
for
a
thousand
new
things
to
come
once
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
look
for
anything
new
but
now
every
hour
as
it
came
thrilled
her
with
consciousness
that
her
life
might
be
changed
in
it
that
it
might
prove
the
supreme
moment
which
should
decide
the
character
and
colour
of
all
the
rest
and
yet
what
hope
what
chance
what
possibility
was
there
that
this
auspicious
moment
should
come
now
had
not
been
driven
away
this
was
how
she
phrased
it
to
herself
not
one
person
but
every
one
who
could
approach
her
now
in
the
solitude
which
was
a
more
effectual
guard
than
twenty
brothers
if
wished
to
come
if
any
one
had
anything
to
say
why
the
visit
must
be
postponed
and
the
words
left
unsaid
until
how
could
she
tell
how
long
three
years
had
passed
between
arthur
two
last
visits
what
if
three
years
should
come
and
go
again
before
chance
or
fate
brought
him
back
it
could
only
be
chance
that
had
done
it
this
time
not
providence
for
if
providence
had
been
the
agent
then
the
visit
must
have
come
to
something
and
not
ended
without
result
thus
clare
mused
as
it
were
in
the
depths
of
her
being
concealing
even
from
herself
what
she
was
thinking
when
arthur
name
flitted
across
that
part
of
her
mind
which
lay
so
to
speak
in
the
light
she
blushed
and
started
with
a
sense
of
guilt
but
in
the
shadowy
corners
where
thought
has
no
need
of
words
and
where
a
hundred
aimless
cogitations
pass
like
breath
and
no
sense
of
responsibility
comes
in
she
put
no
bridle
upon
her
dreaming
fancy
and
it
was
all
new
to
her
for
dreams
had
never
been
much
in
way
hers
had
been
a
practical
intelligence
busied
with
many
things
to
do
and
think
of
the
village
and
her
subjects
in
it
the
legislation
necessary
for
them
the
wants
of
the
old
women
and
the
children
a
hundred
matters
of
detail
which
deserved
the
consideration
of
a
wise
ruler
and
yet
must
be
kept
subordinate
to
greater
principles
even
the
larger
questions
affecting
the
estate
had
come
more
or
less
into
hands
she
had
been
allowed
no
time
to
dream
and
she
had
not
dreamt
but
now
idleness
and
loneliness
fell
upon
her
both
together
she
was
weary
of
the
village
and
its
concerns
she
had
nothing
else
to
occupy
her
and
indeed
she
had
no
desire
for
other
occupations
but
preferred
this
new
musing
this
maze
of
fancies
to
anything
else
in
earth
and
heaven
but
the
evenings
were
dreary
dreary
when
darkness
fell
and
the
wistful
shadows
of
the
summer
night
gathered
about
her
and
no
one
came
to
break
the
silence
she
tried
to
follow
her
brother
in
imagination
and
to
picture
to
herself
what
he
might
be
doing
hanging
about
gussy
thornleigh
perhaps
letting
himself
drift
into
the
channel
indicated
by
lady
augusta
ah
and
then
while
she
thought
she
was
still
thinking
of
edgar
and
gussy
fancies
would
take
their
flight
in
another
direction
to
another
hero
when
this
however
had
gone
on
for
a
few
days
and
nights
she
was
seized
with
a
sense
that
it
must
not
continue
that
such
a
way
of
passing
her
time
was
fatal
it
was
much
too
like
the
girls
whom
clare
had
read
of
in
novels
whom
she
had
indignantly
denied
to
be
true
representatives
of
womankind
and
whom
she
had
scorned
and
blushed
for
in
her
heart
was
she
to
become
one
of
that
maudlin
sentimental
band
to
whom
love
as
and
essayists
said
was
everything
and
to
whom
the
inclinations
of
one
man
in
this
world
conveyed
life
or
death
modesty
and
her
pride
and
her
good
sense
all
rose
in
arms
she
had
given
up
all
her
former
pursuits
for
these
first
dreamy
days
but
now
she
woke
up
and
tied
on
her
hat
and
forced
herself
down
the
avenue
to
the
village
there
something
was
sure
to
be
found
to
do
whatever
might
be
the
state
of
her
own
mind
or
its
fancies
she
walked
straight
to
cottage
where
mary
smith
and
ellen
jones
were
still
busy
with
their
needlework
and
their
sarah
was
sitting
out
in
her
cottage
doorway
enjoying
the
evening
calm
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
but
it
had
fallen
below
the
line
of
the
trees
and
doorway
was
shadowy
and
cool
the
old
woman
had
many
grumbles
bottled
up
for
private
enjoyment
which
had
been
aggravated
by
keeping
mary
was
thoughtlessest
she
had
burned
a
big
hole
in
miss
muslin
with
an
iron
that
was
too
hot
she
had
torn
mrs
lace
and
then
instead
of
trying
to
do
her
best
for
the
future
she
had
cried
her
eyes
out
and
become
hysterical
and
could
do
nothing
at
all
nor
was
ellen
a
great
deal
better
sally
next
door
had
got
a
piece
of
work
clean
spoiled
in
her
hands
and
some
things
as
she
was
making
for
mrs
solms
the
housekeeper
had
just
got
to
be
unpicked
on
the
spot
back
was
put
to
the
front
and
the
wrong
side
to
the
right
side
as
if
she
had
tried
said
old
sarah
be
accident
miss
clare
and
the
sleeves
put
in
bottom
up
enough
to
break
a
heart
after
all
the
trouble
the
two
culprits
stood
curtseying
with
their
aprons
to
their
eyes
while
this
dreadful
picture
was
being
drawn
and
clare
put
on
her
most
solemn
face
and
told
them
she
was
very
sorry
hope
i
shall
never
hear
anything
of
the
kind
again
she
said
in
her
most
serious
tones
and
then
stopped
and
sighed
with
a
weariness
which
had
never
before
moved
her
i
to
go
on
all
my
life
she
said
to
herself
after
and
sewing
is
this
all
i
am
to
have
out
of
the
existence
which
is
so
rich
and
full
to
some
people
and
for
the
moment
clare
thought
she
understood
helena
thornleigh
and
the
rest
of
the
young
women
who
wanted
something
to
do
but
this
the
reader
will
perceive
was
not
really
because
she
wanted
anything
to
do
or
was
dissatisfied
with
the
conditions
of
her
own
life
but
only
because
she
was
in
that
state
of
suspense
which
turns
existence
all
awry
and
demands
excitement
of
some
kind
outside
to
neutralise
the
excitement
within
mind
however
was
suddenly
diverted
from
herself
when
she
looked
into
old
and
saw
another
figure
which
she
had
not
before
remarked
seated
in
the
background
when
sarah
perceived
her
keen
look
inside
she
approached
clare
with
nods
and
significant
glances
miss
she
said
in
a
whisper
there
and
as
sensible
as
you
or
me
and
the
sweetest
little
thing
that
ever
was
though
scotch
and
i
hold
with
scotch
not
in
general
just
you
go
in
and
say
a
word
to
her
miss
think
she
ought
to
be
left
by
herself
said
clare
drawing
back
with
a
certain
repugnance
jeanie
was
seated
in
a
low
chair
and
looked
like
a
child
her
pretty
head
with
its
golden
hair
closely
braided
about
it
bent
over
her
work
she
looked
so
serious
so
absorbed
in
her
occupation
so
far
removed
from
the
feverish
regions
in
which
clare
felt
herself
to
be
wandering
that
the
dislike
she
had
felt
for
this
mysterious
child
suddenly
warmed
into
a
certain
curiosity
and
interest
she
paused
on
the
threshold
looking
in
feeling
as
if
the
step
she
was
about
to
take
was
much
more
important
than
an
innocent
entrance
into
cottage
but
after
that
momentary
hesitation
she
went
in
causing
the
little
recluse
to
raise
her
head
when
she
saw
who
it
was
jeanie
rose
and
gave
miss
arden
a
chair
not
as
mary
or
ellen
would
have
done
but
with
simple
courtesy
she
stood
until
her
visitor
was
seated
and
then
sat
down
again
but
still
she
did
not
give
to
clare
that
curtsey
which
she
felt
to
be
her
due
am
glad
to
see
you
are
better
clare
said
with
a
little
stiffness
and
then
she
was
melted
in
spite
of
herself
by
the
soft
wistful
look
in
little
eyes
your
mother
left
you
alone
she
said
must
be
strange
to
you
to
be
left
alone
in
such
a
place
as
are
all
kind
kind
said
jeanie
no
lonely
as
if
it
was
new
to
me
and
then
i
have
something
to
do
my
head
has
been
so
strange
i
have
never
had
a
seam
for
so
long
and
now
it
is
as
if
i
was
coming
back
child
said
clare
it
make
you
suffer
much
do
you
feel
ill
when
i
mean
when
your
head
has
been
strange
as
you
say
canna
think
about
it
said
jeanie
softly
mustna
think
about
it
the
world
begins
to
swim
and
swim
and
the
light
to
go
out
of
my
eyes
i
will
sew
my
seam
if
ye
and
then
there
was
a
little
pause
and
everything
was
still
old
sarah
and
her
pupils
stayed
outside
and
the
murmur
of
their
voices
sounded
softly
in
the
summer
air
but
within
the
clock
ticked
and
the
white
ashes
from
the
fire
fell
now
and
then
faintly
on
the
hearth
and
rustled
as
she
worked
that
was
all
though
there
was
that
ghost
of
a
fire
the
room
with
its
tiny
window
and
thick
walls
was
cooler
than
many
a
much
better
ventilated
house
and
the
light
was
cool
and
green
and
shadowy
coming
through
the
tall
woody
branches
of
a
geranium
trained
upon
a
fanshaped
framework
which
answered
instead
of
a
curtain
to
the
little
window
clare
sat
embarrassed
not
knowing
how
to
address
this
creature
who
was
so
unlike
anything
she
had
known
or
encountered
before
you
remember
your
home
i
suppose
it
is
a
place
very
different
from
arden
she
said
at
last
oh
bonnie
bonnie
bonnier
than
arden
cried
jeanie
and
then
she
paused
with
instinctive
courtesy
arden
is
beautiful
she
said
so
beautiful
that
god
has
made
i
bide
towns
and
streets
and
places
that
are
built
but
arden
and
the
green
grass
and
the
bonnie
trees
where
had
the
child
learned
to
think
of
other
sentiments
was
it
natural
to
her
nation
or
only
to
her
individual
character
clare
felt
that
the
marys
and
ellens
of
the
village
would
not
have
thought
of
any
such
refinement
you
live
among
the
hills
she
said
loch
arroch
side
the
trees
are
very
bonnie
and
so
are
all
the
parks
and
pleasant
fields
said
jeanie
if
you
were
to
see
the
hills
up
among
the
clouds
and
the
bonnie
water
at
their
feet
and
then
when
you
live
always
there
and
your
heart
gets
full
child
said
clare
again
growing
more
and
more
interested
in
spite
of
herself
are
too
young
to
have
felt
your
heart
grow
full
as
you
am
seventeen
said
jeanie
folk
have
learned
trouble
before
that
granny
says
she
had
nobody
to
take
care
of
her
when
she
was
seventeen
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
and
i
have
always
her
oh
if
you
had
seen
my
willie
she
said
suddenly
was
aye
so
bright
and
so
kind
miss
arden
you
have
a
brother
too
poor
child
cried
clare
jeanie
if
that
is
your
name
think
of
that
for
your
poor
sake
do
anything
to
bring
it
can
not
bring
it
on
said
jeanie
comes
when
i
am
not
thinking
of
willie
if
there
is
ever
a
time
i
am
not
thinking
of
him
best
to
let
me
cry
oh
my
bonnie
boy
and
in
the
sea
miss
arden
think
of
that
no
a
grave
under
the
sod
where
i
could
go
and
greet
but
in
yon
great
great
wild
stormy
sea
it
is
that
i
can
not
us
talk
of
something
else
said
clare
trembling
you
like
old
sarah
i
hope
she
is
very
attentive
to
you
and
does
everything
you
want
you
must
come
to
the
hall
some
day
and
see
me
i
am
all
alone
in
the
has
he
gone
that
you
are
your
lane
said
jeanie
and
she
raised
her
head
with
a
look
of
anxiety
which
startled
clare
whom
cried
miss
arden
she
drew
herself
up
and
looked
at
jeanie
from
her
altitude
feeling
all
her
prejudices
reawaken
jeanie
for
her
part
put
down
her
work
in
her
lap
and
crossed
her
hands
softly
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
am
meaning
your
bonnie
brother
miss
arden
oh
i
wish
he
was
my
brother
we
dinna
know
him
but
fond
of
him
both
grannie
and
of
him
exclaimed
clare
more
and
more
bewildered
you
know
what
you
say
aye
real
fond
said
innocent
jeanie
has
such
a
bonnie
light
in
his
and
while
clare
sat
in
a
state
of
partial
stupefaction
wondering
what
this
might
mean
there
was
a
little
stir
at
the
door
and
murray
came
in
as
it
were
to
the
rescue
before
her
child
could
commit
herself
more
chapter
am
speaking
of
miss
brother
said
jeanie
introducing
her
grandmother
into
the
conversation
without
a
pause
tell
miss
arden
like
faces
we
ken
and
his
voice
is
like
a
kent
voice
if
i
was
in
trouble
i
would
go
and
ask
him
i
would
trust
him
and
i
would
be
safe
granny
speaks
as
others
of
her
age
would
scarcely
speak
said
the
grandmother
quietly
no
like
others
miss
arden
her
trouble
is
like
a
shield
about
her
like
an
angel
the
lord
you
think
she
should
not
name
like
that
a
gentleman
far
far
above
her
but
in
her
innocence
she
speaks
she
has
taken
a
fancy
into
her
head
that
your
brother
is
like
her
brother
he
is
said
jeanie
softly
would
have
thought
so
too
if
she
had
seen
my
willie
no
like
yon
grand
dark
hard
man
that
comes
and
troubles
me
with
his
but
oh
so
friendly
and
so
kind
and
like
a
real
brother
the
other
gives
me
a
thrill
at
my
heart
feared
still
though
no
other
said
clare
in
some
amazement
except
the
rector
and
the
doctor
there
was
no
gentleman
in
arden
of
whom
jeanie
could
have
spoken
and
neither
of
them
could
be
so
described
a
grand
dark
hard
man
her
heart
began
to
flutter
painfully
and
no
one
answered
her
question
perhaps
it
was
because
there
was
a
rustle
and
movement
outside
and
sarah
appeared
on
the
threshold
acoming
miss
clare
with
her
daughter
and
the
gentlemen
said
old
sarah
awful
pushing
and
not
one
as
likes
that
sort
and
murray
best
for
you
and
for
me
as
jeanie
should
go
will
go
upstairs
too
said
clare
hurriedly
and
she
rose
and
went
hastily
up
the
narrow
staircase
forgetting
that
any
invitation
was
necessary
but
murray
did
not
forget
she
made
a
little
ceremonious
speech
to
the
unceremonious
young
lady
of
the
manor
a
poor
place
she
said
such
as
it
is
miss
arden
is
very
clare
however
was
far
too
deeply
convinced
of
her
own
importance
to
see
any
reproof
in
these
words
and
sit
here
said
jeanie
softly
stealing
a
little
hand
which
was
like
a
into
see
all
the
folk
passing
from
this
window
granny
says
no
to
do
it
but
i
say
what
harm
and
there
he
is
that
dark
man
i
saw
him
with
you
and
once
since
then
and
he
spoke
soft
and
kind
but
oh
miss
arden
feared
for
that
man
you
canna
see
into
his
heart
whiles
i
think
has
he
a
heart
at
all
and
what
does
he
want
coming
here
curiosity
or
rather
her
anxiety
was
great
she
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
to
the
lattice
window
which
stood
half
open
all
embowered
in
honeysuckle
she
kept
soft
hand
in
hers
with
a
sense
of
clinging
to
it
as
if
there
was
help
in
its
soft
childlike
pressure
the
were
walking
down
the
village
street
filling
the
breadth
of
the
road
pimpernel
and
gorgeous
as
usual
her
pretty
daughter
half
smothered
in
her
finery
at
one
hand
the
young
curate
denbigh
whose
head
was
supposed
to
be
turned
by
croquet
and
alice
and
on
the
other
clare
said
to
herself
she
had
known
it
all
along
she
had
divined
it
from
the
first
moment
when
jeanie
spoke
she
stood
leaning
one
arm
against
the
window
and
with
the
other
hand
holding
jeanie
fast
yes
of
course
it
was
he
she
had
known
it
all
along
the
scene
looked
so
familiar
to
her
that
she
seemed
to
have
seen
it
somewhere
in
a
picture
ages
ago
pretty
alice
pimpernel
blushing
and
saying
two
words
by
intervals
now
and
then
no
arden
and
yes
was
not
that
the
sort
of
conversation
alice
pimpernel
kept
up
somebody
she
could
not
remember
who
had
once
told
clare
and
stooping
over
her
doing
his
best
to
entertain
her
smiling
that
smile
she
knew
so
well
clare
grasped
hand
so
hard
that
it
hurt
the
girl
who
gave
a
cry
and
then
the
young
princess
of
arden
dropped
suddenly
into
the
nearest
chair
her
heart
seemed
to
sink
somewhere
into
unimaginable
depths
it
was
no
surprise
to
her
she
had
known
it
all
along
and
yet
jeanie
stood
by
her
unaware
of
what
was
passing
through
her
mind
or
was
she
somehow
aware
though
clare
said
not
a
word
thinks
little
little
of
her
speaking
to
said
jeanie
softly
thinks
nothing
of
her
if
it
was
me
i
would
not
let
a
man
speak
to
me
and
look
at
me
like
that
and
scorn
me
miss
arden
rich
and
grand
but
he
thinks
better
than
them
he
better
than
them
said
clare
under
her
breath
is
an
arden
better
than
them
they
are
nobody
you
are
better
hush
you
understand
and
she
held
the
little
hand
clasped
tight
and
almost
leaned
upon
jeanie
not
knowing
it
the
party
came
nearer
their
voices
became
audible
from
the
window
and
it
annoyed
clare
to
hear
sounds
behind
her
murray
moving
about
which
prevented
her
hearing
what
was
said
she
uttered
an
imperative
and
turned
round
half
angrily
to
command
silence
but
still
she
could
hear
nothing
but
the
tones
the
voice
she
knew
so
well
must
see
her
she
is
the
prettiest
creature
she
heard
him
say
just
as
they
passed
into
the
room
below
and
then
clare
loosed
hand
and
looked
at
her
with
a
new
inspiration
it
was
not
for
alice
pimpernel
it
was
for
jeanie
this
visit
was
made
pretended
to
be
afraid
of
him
when
you
met
him
with
me
she
said
sharply
and
then
turned
to
the
grandmother
fainted
or
something
at
the
sight
of
him
and
now
he
brings
people
to
make
a
show
of
her
how
is
this
she
cried
you
know
that
this
village
is
mine
and
i
have
the
charge
of
it
i
must
know
what
it
means
you
must
explain
this
to
arden
said
murray
mistake
me
and
mine
i
canna
tell
why
i
have
lived
sixty
years
in
this
world
and
nobody
has
bidden
me
humble
myself
as
you
have
done
though
it
is
justice
upon
me
but
you
know
nothing
of
that
i
owe
ye
no
explanation
i
am
not
of
your
parish
nor
in
your
charge
but
out
of
courtesy
and
because
of
something
ye
never
heard
of
satisfy
you
this
time
the
man
is
nothing
to
her
nor
to
me
he
was
like
a
man
that
once
we
knew
as
i
told
you
but
he
came
here
three
days
ago
and
i
was
glad
for
the
poor
bairn
saw
it
was
another
face
and
another
voice
and
got
over
her
fear
clever
and
as
ye
ken
but
he
should
never
speak
to
my
jeanie
more
never
with
my
will
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
you
should
not
be
here
spying
on
your
kinsman
you
such
a
proud
lady
you
should
not
watch
at
that
window
nor
catch
his
words
unawares
i
would
do
more
for
you
than
for
anybody
in
the
world
not
my
ain
do
you
talk
such
nonsense
to
me
cried
clare
angrily
i
such
a
fool
as
to
be
deceived
by
it
what
reason
have
you
to
care
for
me
i
thought
you
were
proud
and
gave
yourself
airs
but
i
did
not
think
you
would
make
false
pretences
like
this
why
should
you
care
for
me
canna
tell
ye
why
and
ye
will
never
ken
said
murray
with
a
sigh
i
would
give
my
life
for
you
or
your
brother
if
that
would
serve
you
but
you
say
well
i
have
no
right
to
make
pretences
young
and
old
miss
arden
and
when
your
kinsman
is
below
you
should
not
be
watching
him
am
not
watching
him
said
clare
and
she
sat
with
an
obstinate
stateliness
by
the
window
her
face
deeply
flushed
her
heart
beating
high
it
was
not
her
fault
she
would
not
have
stolen
here
into
this
coign
of
had
she
thought
of
arthur
it
was
but
to
avoid
the
pimpernels
not
to
watch
him
but
even
had
she
known
he
was
coming
would
it
not
have
been
better
in
any
case
to
keep
out
of
his
way
had
not
edgar
left
home
on
purpose
to
send
him
away
from
arden
edgar
whose
fault
it
was
who
had
thus
thrown
his
cousin
into
the
arms
of
the
pimpernels
into
the
way
of
temptation
clare
was
unreasonable
as
was
natural
she
forgot
as
it
is
so
easy
to
forget
that
arthur
arden
was
much
older
than
her
brother
far
more
experienced
a
man
doubly
learned
in
the
ways
of
the
world
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
her
had
been
to
suspect
poor
little
jeanie
to
blame
murray
and
now
her
imagination
fell
upon
edgar
putting
all
the
responsibility
on
his
shoulders
he
had
sent
his
cousin
away
it
was
a
new
beginning
which
poor
arthur
was
making
an
attempt
poor
fellow
at
that
pure
domestic
life
which
had
never
been
within
his
reach
before
and
edgar
who
had
all
the
lands
and
all
the
prosperity
had
refused
to
this
other
arden
even
the
poor
shelter
of
his
roof
the
chance
of
learning
to
love
something
that
was
better
than
his
past
had
been
and
thus
he
had
been
thrown
back
upon
the
pimpernels
to
look
at
these
good
people
in
the
mirror
of
fancy
one
would
have
supposed
they
were
everything
that
was
disorderly
and
improper
instead
of
being
the
most
respectable
of
households
correct
in
every
possible
point
and
domestic
to
a
degree
only
possible
to
a
british
nature
with
commercial
associations
clare
sat
and
listened
to
the
hum
of
voices
with
the
strangest
emotion
what
was
he
doing
there
what
had
he
come
for
why
was
he
making
himself
the
attendant
of
alice
pimpernel
he
had
no
money
and
her
father
was
rich
was
he
thwarted
in
his
affections
intent
upon
marrying
and
indemnifying
himself
by
securing
money
at
least
all
these
thoughts
passed
through
mind
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
very
different
would
have
been
her
thoughts
even
of
arthur
arden
but
mind
was
more
sophisticated
than
and
leapt
in
a
moment
at
this
vulgar
danger
which
to
her
felt
so
real
and
as
we
have
said
the
idea
of
marrying
for
money
did
not
in
itself
revolt
her
if
he
could
not
secure
the
woman
he
loved
and
her
fortune
what
could
he
do
but
at
least
attempt
to
secure
another
fortune
something
he
could
live
on
and
which
would
give
him
something
to
live
for
alice
pimpernel
how
much
would
she
have
clare
wondered
in
her
feverish
suspense
something
surely
not
worth
the
sacrifice
a
share
of
her
money
only
not
an
estate
or
ancient
barony
in
her
own
right
and
then
it
occurred
to
her
suddenly
she
could
not
tell
why
that
old
arden
was
the
seat
of
an
ancient
barony
it
had
dropped
away
from
the
family
in
some
of
the
civil
wars
but
the
squires
had
once
been
barons
and
lord
arden
was
a
title
that
might
easily
be
renewed
in
a
generation
unfriendly
to
attainders
and
which
had
a
respect
for
old
memories
should
it
be
edgar
who
would
bear
the
recovered
title
edgar
lord
arden
the
idea
was
absurd
somehow
and
then
old
arden
was
not
but
hers
hers
to
bestow
good
heavens
that
it
should
be
so
and
all
the
time
arthur
arden
he
who
was
the
truest
representative
of
the
family
in
look
and
thought
and
disposition
he
who
would
be
the
ideal
lord
arden
was
wasting
his
time
upon
a
daughter
a
liverpool
girl
with
a
little
paltry
money
these
may
have
been
deemed
strange
thoughts
for
a
girl
who
had
just
seen
her
lover
absorbed
in
attendance
upon
another
she
had
been
miserable
enough
angry
enough
for
the
first
moment
she
had
loathed
the
innocent
jeanie
and
hated
the
stupid
alice
but
while
she
thus
sat
waiting
and
listening
it
was
another
channel
into
which
her
thoughts
flowed
it
was
because
he
had
been
sent
away
from
her
own
side
that
he
was
driven
to
poor
fellow
and
she
could
give
him
all
that
was
needful
and
the
higher
life
along
with
it
heart
beat
high
with
impatience
as
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
voices
should
she
go
down
and
reveal
herself
should
she
wait
what
should
she
do
it
was
while
her
excitement
thus
gradually
grew
stronger
after
she
had
risen
and
seated
herself
again
twice
over
and
felt
herself
almost
carried
away
by
the
torrent
of
her
thoughts
that
the
stir
took
a
definite
form
there
was
a
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
and
voices
which
came
nearer
and
nearer
murray
divined
what
it
meant
sooner
than
clare
did
and
hastily
taking
hand
led
her
into
the
inner
room
your
seam
my
bonnie
lamb
and
never
you
mind
what
they
say
or
what
they
do
said
the
grandmother
and
she
closed
the
door
upon
her
charge
and
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
took
up
her
own
knitting
the
room
grew
suddenly
a
place
full
of
protection
and
safety
clare
could
not
tell
how
the
first
sensation
of
fright
and
horror
and
excitement
at
the
sound
of
their
approach
died
out
of
her
mind
she
said
under
her
breath
and
then
there
came
a
sudden
knock
and
flutter
of
voices
close
by
and
arthur
arden
smiling
and
introducing
the
pretty
figure
of
alice
pimpernel
suddenly
appeared
at
the
door
chapter
vi
clare
who
knew
what
was
coming
had
instinctively
changed
her
position
she
had
subdued
her
excitement
as
perhaps
only
a
woman
could
do
and
adopted
with
the
speed
of
thought
her
ordinary
air
of
stately
composure
her
look
was
that
of
one
paying
a
dignified
yet
friendly
visit
to
a
cottage
acquaintance
below
her
in
rank
yet
not
beyond
the
range
of
her
sympathy
and
murray
with
feminine
skill
so
natural
that
it
was
unconscious
supported
her
visitor
in
the
emergency
not
a
word
of
explanation
passed
between
them
but
yet
they
instinctively
fell
into
their
parts
arthur
arden
however
was
not
in
the
least
prepared
for
the
sight
which
met
his
eyes
as
he
opened
the
door
partly
as
making
an
experiment
to
see
if
it
was
possible
to
rouse
her
and
partly
out
of
sheer
idleness
and
indifference
he
had
suddenly
suggested
to
alice
pimpernel
to
the
little
upstairs
know
the
mother
and
i
want
your
opinion
he
had
said
arden
had
been
reply
as
she
buttoned
the
second
button
of
her
gloves
and
thus
they
had
come
upstairs
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
in
words
how
small
arthur
arden
felt
when
he
opened
the
door
and
found
himself
suddenly
in
the
presence
of
his
cousin
clare
though
he
was
a
man
of
experience
and
not
easily
daunted
the
sudden
sight
of
her
covered
him
with
confusion
instead
of
introducing
alice
into
the
room
as
he
had
intended
he
stumbled
into
it
before
her
and
changed
colour
and
hesitated
like
a
boy
of
sixteen
arden
he
stammered
forth
not
knowing
what
he
said
and
forgot
all
about
alice
pimpernel
behind
him
who
tried
to
peep
over
his
shoulder
and
mentally
sank
upon
her
knees
before
the
majesty
of
clare
said
clare
and
then
after
a
little
pause
you
want
me
arden
or
murray
please
tell
me
and
i
will
go
wanted
it
is
nothing
i
did
not
know
arthur
stammered
pimpernel
was
interested
that
is
i
told
her
of
i
think
you
know
miss
and
then
much
confused
he
stood
aside
and
made
visible
alice
who
proferred
her
shy
obeisance
and
once
more
buttoned
her
glove
too
shy
to
venture
to
speak
clare
rose
and
bowed
in
her
stately
way
she
was
mistress
of
the
situation
and
no
one
could
have
told
how
violently
her
heart
was
beating
against
her
side
have
paid
murray
too
long
a
visit
she
said
must
go
now
i
did
not
know
you
were
in
the
neighbourhood
arden
you
are
at
the
red
house
i
suppose
said
arthur
meekly
meant
to
have
let
you
know
but
pimpernel
is
i
intended
to
have
continued
my
walk
to
the
hall
to
ask
how
you
were
i
am
always
very
well
said
clare
and
then
there
was
a
pause
in
the
hostilities
and
the
two
armies
stopped
and
looked
at
each
other
murray
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
belligerents
up
to
this
moment
she
had
gone
on
quietly
with
her
knitting
aware
that
her
own
charge
was
in
safety
now
she
looked
up
from
her
work
though
without
rising
from
her
seat
and
turned
to
the
with
a
grave
face
ye
were
wanting
me
sir
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
was
for
i
am
no
used
to
the
ways
of
the
place
and
i
can
not
think
i
could
be
of
any
miss
arden
said
alice
pimpernel
driven
to
her
end
and
feeling
that
it
was
now
her
turn
to
say
something
the
girl
gave
clare
a
supplicating
glance
she
knit
something
for
mamma
or
oh
i
know
what
to
say
and
arthur
arden
gave
no
assistance
he
stood
speechless
among
them
cursing
his
own
folly
clare
had
all
the
advantage
whereas
he
had
only
the
comfort
of
feeling
that
he
had
made
himself
look
like
a
fool
in
eyes
think
the
young
lady
has
come
to
see
jeanie
said
clare
jeanie
is
no
a
show
that
folk
should
come
to
see
her
said
the
grandmother
is
as
much
thought
of
and
as
precious
to
her
own
folk
as
any
young
lady
no
that
i
would
be
uncivil
to
them
that
mean
no
harm
but
my
jeanie
is
as
sacred
to
me
as
any
arden
said
poor
alice
pimpernel
at
this
moment
there
was
heard
in
the
distance
the
sound
of
rustling
robes
and
heavy
feet
upon
the
stair
a
sound
which
carried
confusion
to
all
bosoms
except
that
of
alice
whose
relief
when
she
heard
the
approach
of
her
maternal
guardian
was
great
cheerful
voice
was
heard
before
she
could
be
seen
she
said
you
seen
her
and
is
she
as
wonderful
as
you
thought
poor
thing
i
am
sure
i
am
sorry
for
her
with
this
stair
to
go
up
and
down
and
the
poor
old
lady
the
poor
old
lady
stood
confronting
pimpernel
who
came
in
very
red
and
heated
and
almost
fell
into
her
arms
good
woman
do
give
me
a
chair
she
cried
am
nearly
suffocated
oh
alice
and
arden
what
are
you
doing
here
give
me
a
chair
please
miss
arden
i
declare
how
nice
it
is
to
meet
like
this
when
one
is
trying
to
do
the
little
good
one
can
among
the
poor
it
is
so
charming
of
you
to
take
such
trouble
with
your
people
miss
arden
there
is
really
next
to
nothing
left
for
any
one
else
to
do
might
i
ask
you
for
a
glass
of
water
my
good
woman
and
wipe
the
glass
first
please
everything
looks
very
clean
but
one
never
can
get
quite
rid
of
dust
in
a
cottage
wipe
it
well
clare
stood
looking
on
with
consternation
while
these
ejaculations
were
uttered
she
had
very
little
sympathy
with
murray
but
yet
there
was
something
about
her
which
made
easy
good
sound
extraordinary
enough
will
she
do
will
she
scold
or
turn
her
out
was
question
to
herself
what
murray
did
was
to
laugh
a
low
soft
laugh
which
brightened
her
face
as
clare
had
never
seen
it
and
to
bring
from
a
a
bottle
of
water
a
glass
and
a
napkin
she
rubbed
the
glass
for
full
three
minutes
always
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
you
think
it
clean
now
she
said
holding
it
up
with
amused
demonstration
i
were
at
home
i
would
give
you
better
than
water
and
if
you
should
ever
come
to
loch
arroch
i
will
be
glad
to
see
you
you
and
yours
miss
arden
the
lady
means
no
harm
the
old
woman
added
turning
to
clare
simple
and
kind
why
should
i
no
make
clean
the
glass
and
serve
her
to
drink
she
kens
no
better
i
take
that
easy
easy
but
them
that
would
make
an
exhibition
of
my
poor
bairn
think
any
one
meant
to
offend
you
said
clare
and
then
she
turned
and
bowed
to
pimpernel
who
started
from
her
seat
to
detain
her
must
go
thank
you
i
am
busy
she
said
with
another
stately
gesture
of
to
where
arthur
and
alice
stood
together
jeanie
to
see
me
she
added
pausing
as
she
went
away
it
was
an
impulse
she
could
not
restrain
though
part
in
it
was
very
small
she
lingered
that
there
might
be
a
chance
for
some
one
else
to
say
something
a
possibility
and
then
she
made
that
chance
impossible
up
as
early
as
twelve
please
if
she
is
well
enough
i
have
a
great
deal
to
talk
to
you
and
with
these
words
she
hurried
away
she
would
not
look
at
him
or
permit
any
sympathetic
glance
to
open
the
way
for
a
word
and
yet
she
had
lingered
that
a
look
or
word
might
come
strange
inconsistency
she
ran
downstairs
leaving
them
above
leaving
them
together
and
went
out
alone
without
saying
a
word
to
sarah
or
her
myrmidons
feeling
so
lonely
so
sad
so
solitary
so
deserted
by
heaven
and
earth
it
was
right
quite
right
of
arthur
arden
to
make
some
provision
for
himself
she
had
no
fault
to
find
with
him
not
a
word
to
say
but
she
was
very
solitary
and
very
sad
if
she
only
had
been
spared
the
sight
of
it
but
no
all
her
fortitude
would
be
required
he
would
probably
live
here
in
the
neighbourhood
somewhere
after
he
had
married
alice
pimpernel
and
he
would
be
well
off
at
least
if
not
happy
oh
surely
not
happy
with
that
insipid
creature
who
buttoned
her
gloves
and
trembled
to
hear
her
own
name
clare
hurried
along
the
village
street
at
a
pace
quite
unusual
to
her
but
she
had
not
gone
far
when
she
found
that
she
was
pursued
she
would
not
look
back
for
the
first
moment
but
notwithstanding
the
repugnance
in
her
own
mind
to
turn
and
speak
to
him
it
was
inconsistent
to
her
dignity
to
be
thus
followed
by
her
cousin
whom
everybody
knew
she
turned
round
with
the
best
grace
she
could
muster
and
addressed
him
with
her
usual
manner
you
want
me
she
said
and
slackened
her
pace
that
he
might
come
up
seems
so
strange
that
you
should
ask
said
arthur
you
as
if
i
dared
tell
you
half
how
much
but
never
mind
i
went
to
the
thinking
i
should
be
at
hand
and
might
have
opportunities
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
prejudiced
against
them
may
not
i
even
come
to
see
you
while
i
am
there
there
does
not
matter
much
said
clare
hastily
and
then
she
corrected
herself
course
you
think
me
prejudiced
and
disagreeable
she
said
i
am
as
i
was
brought
up
edgar
thinks
me
dreadfully
prejudiced
i
dare
say
they
are
very
nice
and
all
that
but
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
that
you
did
not
come
to
arden
while
you
were
said
arthur
in
a
low
voice
oh
i
tell
why
because
i
like
it
because
i
am
cross
and
testy
and
like
to
contradict
you
because
but
you
know
it
is
no
use
asking
if
a
woman
is
not
to
chose
who
she
will
call
on
she
must
be
oppressed
and
trampled
down
are
concealing
your
real
objection
said
arthur
and
i
who
went
because
i
thought
why
i
met
edgar
there
but
never
mind
of
course
it
must
be
as
you
please
i
said
i
would
stay
a
fortnight
must
i
never
come
near
you
all
that
time
it
is
very
hard
and
it
is
harder
still
that
edgar
should
have
gone
away
as
he
did
breaking
all
our
party
up
do
you
know
i
have
never
been
so
happy
not
all
my
life
am
sure
you
must
be
quite
as
happy
now
said
clare
i
hope
you
will
be
prosperous
in
everything
you
may
undertake
edgar
i
am
sure
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
and
i
i
do
so
hope
arden
that
everything
you
wish
will
thrive
as
you
wish
and
here
clare
stopped
short
breathing
quickly
almost
overcome
by
mixture
of
despite
and
and
sorrow
for
herself
which
was
in
her
mind
you
indeed
he
said
is
very
very
kind
of
you
it
would
be
kinder
still
if
you
knew
but
you
care
to
know
if
i
should
ever
remind
you
of
your
good
wishes
not
now
because
i
dare
not
but
afterwards
some
time
if
i
should
pluck
up
courage
think
there
is
any
great
courage
required
said
clare
me
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
hear
that
you
have
done
well
for
yourself
there
could
be
no
more
agreeable
news
neither
edgar
nor
i
could
have
any
desire
but
to
see
you
happy
excuse
me
i
am
going
to
see
miss
somers
i
should
ask
you
to
come
in
too
but
she
is
such
an
invalid
and
i
am
keeping
you
from
your
friends
you
may
be
sure
you
have
my
very
best
wishes
and
clare
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
smiled
a
smile
which
was
very
proud
and
uncomfortable
she
had
not
in
the
least
intended
to
visit
miss
somers
but
it
would
have
been
utterly
impossible
for
her
she
thought
to
have
walked
up
all
the
length
of
the
avenue
by
arthur
side
most
likely
he
would
have
told
her
of
his
progress
with
alice
and
how
could
she
bear
that
it
was
better
to
part
thus
abruptly
as
long
as
she
was
capable
of
smiling
and
uttering
those
good
wishes
which
she
had
some
faint
perception
were
gall
and
wormwood
to
the
recipient
she
could
see
that
her
benevolent
hopes
and
desires
were
bitter
to
him
and
it
pleased
her
to
see
it
yet
notwithstanding
she
still
believed
in
alice
pimpernel
why
should
he
be
there
otherwise
he
might
not
like
it
to
be
known
until
everything
was
settled
it
might
be
galling
to
his
pride
but
still
why
should
he
be
there
but
for
that
it
was
the
only
possible
attraction
and
no
doubt
it
was
a
very
sensible
thing
to
do
she
hurried
across
to
the
house
without
looking
back
eager
to
be
rid
of
him
to
get
away
to
forget
all
about
it
and
yet
not
without
a
thought
that
perhaps
he
would
refuse
to
be
dismissed
perhaps
would
insist
upon
explaining
perhaps
but
the
door
opened
and
closed
upon
her
and
not
a
word
was
said
to
prevent
her
visit
to
miss
somers
when
she
looked
out
of
the
window
arthur
was
walking
very
slowly
and
quietly
down
the
street
to
rejoin
his
friends
this
was
how
it
was
to
be
well
he
had
been
driven
out
of
arden
poor
fellow
he
had
been
discouraged
in
his
dearer
hopes
she
herself
had
been
unkind
to
him
and
edgar
had
been
oh
how
unkind
and
he
was
poor
and
must
do
something
to
himself
in
the
world
was
he
to
blame
clare
clasped
her
two
hands
tightly
together
and
set
her
lips
close
that
no
sigh
might
escape
from
them
what
alternative
was
there
for
him
but
to
act
as
he
was
doing
and
what
for
her
but
to
wish
him
well
and
edgar
too
no
doubt
would
wish
him
well
edgar
who
had
done
it
all
chapter
vii
arthur
arden
went
back
to
the
with
no
very
comfortable
feelings
he
had
gone
to
the
red
house
he
said
in
order
to
be
near
arden
and
that
he
might
make
frequent
visits
to
the
central
object
of
his
pursuit
but
he
had
not
been
aware
how
far
clare
carried
out
her
principles
and
that
she
really
declined
to
know
the
people
whom
she
did
not
think
her
equals
arthur
was
accustomed
to
people
who
sneer
yet
visit
and
take
advantage
of
all
the
wealth
and
luxuries
of
the
make
use
of
them
was
not
that
what
all
the
world
did
accepting
their
costly
dinners
and
fine
carriages
and
laughing
at
them
behind
their
backs
how
was
it
that
clare
refused
to
do
this
like
other
people
her
kinsman
could
not
tell
he
thought
it
foolish
of
her
if
clare
could
do
anything
foolish
and
in
his
own
mind
quoted
the
example
of
a
great
many
very
fine
people
indeed
who
did
it
freely
why
should
one
be
so
much
better
than
others
he
thought
to
himself
and
so
went
back
disconcerted
to
join
the
pimpernels
clare
was
wrong
in
the
conclusion
she
had
jumped
at
and
still
she
was
not
altogether
wrong
alice
was
pretty
and
quite
inoffensive
and
she
would
have
thirty
thousand
pounds
when
a
young
man
of
good
family
without
any
money
or
any
profession
has
arrived
at
the
borders
of
forty
various
questions
present
themselves
to
him
in
a
very
decided
way
and
demand
consideration
what
is
to
become
of
him
you
may
keep
time
at
bay
if
you
have
all
the
aids
and
preventives
at
hand
for
doing
so
but
when
that
is
not
the
case
when
you
have
on
the
other
hand
anxieties
instead
of
cosmetics
and
increase
your
wrinkles
by
every
thought
the
crisis
is
a
very
formidable
one
arthur
arden
had
been
brought
up
like
so
many
young
men
with
vague
thoughts
of
an
appointment
which
was
to
do
everything
for
him
this
expectation
had
quieted
the
consciences
of
everybody
belonging
to
him
he
had
been
waiting
for
an
appointment
as
long
as
he
could
recollect
and
he
was
still
waiting
for
it
now
to
tell
the
truth
the
progress
of
years
did
not
make
it
more
likely
or
bring
it
any
nearer
but
still
he
knew
a
great
many
people
who
had
in
their
hands
the
giving
of
appointments
and
it
was
not
impossible
that
such
a
thing
might
drop
from
the
skies
at
any
moment
what
he
would
have
done
with
it
when
it
came
after
so
many
lounging
about
the
world
without
anything
definite
to
do
is
a
different
question
but
in
the
meantime
alice
pimpernel
as
a
was
as
good
as
an
appointment
and
clare
a
great
deal
better
and
it
seemed
only
natural
that
the
best
should
claim
his
devotion
first
he
had
not
attempted
to
exercise
upon
alice
the
full
force
of
those
fascinations
which
he
had
poured
forth
upon
clare
but
he
kept
her
in
hand
as
it
were
ready
for
an
emergency
he
cleared
the
cloud
off
his
face
as
he
approached
the
door
of
old
cottage
where
the
ladies
had
just
appeared
young
denbigh
the
curate
had
left
them
when
they
went
in
so
that
arthur
was
their
sole
escort
he
arrived
in
time
to
hear
parting
words
think
any
more
about
the
loss
it
was
not
very
expensive
lace
you
know
and
i
have
plenty
thank
heaven
i
am
not
in
circumstances
to
be
obliged
to
consider
every
trifle
i
was
annoyed
at
first
of
course
and
it
was
dreadfully
careless
of
the
girl
what
does
she
expect
is
to
become
of
her
i
wonder
if
she
takes
no
more
pains
i
have
known
a
girl
just
simply
ruined
by
such
carelessness
oh
you
need
not
cry
crying
does
very
little
good
i
assure
you
i
have
what
atelling
morning
noon
and
night
said
old
sarah
while
the
culprit
retired
into
her
apron
and
sobbed
and
curtsied
being
past
all
power
of
speech
ruined
said
pimpernel
with
solemn
iteration
i
trust
you
will
think
what
you
are
doing
and
never
be
so
wicked
again
i
am
very
much
interested
in
your
lodgers
sarah
what
a
very
nice
old
woman
and
so
clean
arden
did
you
observe
but
there
is
no
use
speaking
to
you
gentlemen
you
are
always
thinking
of
something
else
so
very
clean
if
anything
should
ever
be
wanted
for
her
or
for
the
sick
girl
you
may
send
to
me
freely
we
are
never
without
some
little
delicacy
you
know
something
that
would
tempt
an
invalid
pimpernel
is
so
very
particular
about
what
he
eats
all
you
gentlemen
are
i
dare
say
you
want
it
more
after
being
out
in
the
world
all
day
knocking
about
well
arden
and
so
you
went
and
made
your
peace
with
your
cousin
i
hope
everything
is
right
was
wrong
said
arthur
hastily
had
no
peace
to
make
i
was
only
anxious
to
ask
miss
arden
about
edgar
i
know
where
he
is
and
i
wanted
his
does
not
half
like
your
staying
with
us
said
pimpernel
speak
to
me
i
know
better
i
know
what
we
have
ever
done
to
her
but
she
hates
us
does
miss
arden
she
is
quite
spiteful
because
you
are
staying
with
mamma
dear
said
alice
in
gentle
deprecation
may
say
what
you
please
alice
but
i
know
better
that
child
is
always
standing
up
for
miss
arden
i
know
why
she
should
i
am
sure
for
she
never
is
barely
civil
not
that
we
want
anything
from
her
we
visit
quite
as
much
as
i
wish
to
visit
but
if
i
were
ever
so
anxious
to
increase
my
list
arden
hall
you
know
it
never
was
very
amusing
i
believe
it
is
not
that
i
care
for
the
airs
she
gives
herself
forget
that
my
cousin
has
been
brought
up
very
quietly
said
arthur
father
was
very
peculiar
he
never
saw
any
society
unless
he
could
not
help
it
you
know
indeed
that
poor
edgar
his
only
son
but
that
is
a
painful
subject
to
us
tell
me
said
pimpernel
hears
hints
you
know
but
it
would
be
so
much
more
satisfactory
from
one
of
the
family
do
please
tell
me
he
snubbed
him
dreadfully
and
never
educated
him
nor
gave
him
any
allowance
nor
anything
fancy
his
own
father
but
there
must
have
been
some
was
a
very
peculiar
man
said
arthur
arden
are
things
in
families
you
know
which
bear
discussion
if
i
was
more
than
i
am
or
more
indifferent
to
the
credit
of
the
name
but
never
mind
it
is
a
question
i
would
rather
not
arden
cried
alice
pimpernel
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
up
at
him
with
unfeigned
admiration
yes
he
was
more
interesting
than
denbigh
with
that
fine
family
face
and
all
its
romantic
associations
and
sacrificing
himself
too
for
the
good
of
the
family
how
grand
it
was
the
pimpernels
too
had
certain
features
which
were
peculiar
to
them
but
oh
how
different
from
the
ardens
denbigh
was
interesting
too
he
was
very
nice
and
attractive
and
second
cousin
to
the
earl
of
tintagel
but
he
had
not
a
story
to
attract
the
imagination
like
this
would
never
insist
upon
confidence
said
pimpernel
it
is
against
my
principles
even
with
my
own
child
if
about
money
i
always
say
to
your
papa
he
is
the
one
to
manage
all
that
and
between
ourselves
he
is
a
great
deal
too
liberal
he
never
knows
how
to
say
to
any
of
them
but
if
their
feelings
i
never
exact
anything
i
am
always
ready
to
do
my
best
but
confidence
is
a
thing
i
would
never
is
a
thing
i
should
be
most
ready
to
give
said
arthur
arden
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
the
secret
were
only
mine
but
my
poor
cousin
edgar
he
is
a
most
worthy
fellow
an
excellent
fellow
i
confess
i
was
prejudiced
against
him
which
is
not
unnatural
you
know
considering
that
he
stands
between
me
and
but
really
it
is
a
question
i
must
not
enter
you
may
say
to
us
will
be
sacred
you
may
be
sure
pimpernel
said
with
breathless
interest
and
alice
looked
up
appealingly
in
his
face
they
were
quite
tremulous
with
expectation
looking
for
some
romance
of
real
life
something
more
exciting
than
gossip
arthur
arden
could
scarcely
restrain
the
impulse
to
mystify
them
at
least
but
he
remembered
that
it
might
be
dangerous
and
refrained
he
said
with
a
sigh
shaking
his
head
even
to
you
if
it
were
my
own
secret
you
should
have
it
fast
enough
but
i
must
not
betray
no
no
and
poor
edgar
is
an
excellent
fellow
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
pimpernel
shot
a
lively
glance
across
him
at
her
daughter
who
replied
to
it
quickly
enough
though
she
was
not
upon
it
there
is
some
flaw
in
edgar
title
was
comment
that
evening
when
she
repeated
the
conversation
to
her
husband
upon
it
not
right
there
i
never
saw
anything
written
more
plainly
on
a
you
must
have
seen
fool
written
after
it
said
pimpernel
and
nonsense
this
fellow
arden
is
very
well
up
to
most
things
he
knows
what
about
does
arden
and
so
he
should
if
making
up
to
your
daughter
wish
you
would
not
be
so
coarse
said
the
lady
up
there
is
nothing
of
the
sort
he
is
an
agreeable
sort
of
man
and
knows
everybody
though
if
there
was
anything
in
this
story
alice
might
do
worse
it
would
be
very
nice
to
have
her
settled
so
near
us
and
arden
is
a
good
name
and
i
must
say
if
there
is
one
thing
i
am
partial
to
it
is
a
good
family
though
you
never
will
acknowledge
it
or
give
any
weight
to
it
it
is
well
known
my
grandmother
was
a
blundell
know
anything
about
your
grandmother
but
i
give
your
daughter
if
i
can
help
it
to
a
fellow
who
has
nothing
why
he
get
his
appointment
or
if
he
wants
to
marry
let
him
marry
his
cousin
and
get
her
share
of
the
property
that
would
be
the
sensible
thing
to
would
not
look
at
his
cousin
take
my
word
for
it
said
pimpernel
has
more
sense
than
that
at
least
a
proud
thing
as
vain
of
her
family
as
if
it
was
any
virtue
of
hers
to
belong
to
an
old
family
she
consulted
about
it
for
my
part
rather
be
like
alice
well
brought
up
with
a
father
and
mother
she
has
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
than
clare
arden
with
all
her
mysteries
and
nonsense
i
should
indeed
and
that
is
a
deal
for
me
to
say
that
am
partial
to
old
families
but
if
you
had
a
chance
you
might
just
question
arthur
arden
a
little
and
see
what
he
means
by
it
i
see
why
he
should
sacrifice
himself
and
if
there
should
be
anything
in
it
to
have
alice
settled
so
near
us
on
such
a
pretty
property
thus
pimpernel
showed
an
inclination
not
only
to
count
her
chickens
before
they
were
hatched
but
even
before
it
was
quite
certain
that
there
were
eggs
for
the
preliminary
ceremony
the
husband
did
not
say
very
much
but
he
thought
the
more
he
had
money
to
back
any
claimant
and
would
not
hesitate
to
do
so
and
as
for
any
folly
about
or
fine
family
feeling
the
felt
that
he
would
make
very
short
work
with
that
and
nonsense
he
said
to
himself
were
all
the
feelings
in
the
world
in
comparison
with
a
fine
property
like
arden
a
property
that
might
almost
double
in
value
if
it
were
in
proper
hands
why
in
building
leases
alone
he
could
undertake
to
add
five
thousand
to
the
property
there
might
be
dozens
of
arden
villas
pimpernel
places
which
would
pay
magnificently
without
interfering
in
the
least
with
and
if
nothing
was
wanted
but
money
for
a
lawsuit
why
he
himself
would
not
mind
providing
the
sinews
of
war
understand
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
your
title
to
arden
he
said
next
morning
in
his
uncompromising
way
heavens
who
said
so
said
arthur
in
consternation
for
to
do
him
justice
he
had
meant
only
to
be
interesting
and
knew
that
as
respected
arden
his
suspicions
and
those
of
other
people
did
not
value
a
brass
farthing
be
cautious
of
repeating
such
a
thing
it
is
quite
new
to
me
why
why
i
thought
you
gave
a
little
colour
to
it
at
least
by
something
you
said
yourself
so
i
heard
said
pimpernel
am
a
practical
man
arden
and
i
never
have
any
time
to
beat
about
the
bush
there
be
anything
in
it
and
you
be
disposed
to
fight
it
out
and
you
have
evidence
and
all
that
why
i
should
not
mind
standing
by
you
as
a
matter
of
business
you
know
i
understand
fine
feelings
but
i
understand
what
an
worth
and
if
you
can
prove
to
my
solicitor
you
have
ground
to
go
upon
why
i
mind
backing
you
up
there
i
never
make
mysteries
about
anything
and
you
will
follow
my
example
if
you
take
my
advice
dear
sir
how
can
i
thank
you
for
your
confidence
in
me
said
arthur
truth
is
there
has
always
been
something
very
odd
but
i
fear
that
so
far
as
evidence
goes
you
may
depend
upon
it
if
i
ever
should
find
myself
in
a
position
to
prove
anything
yours
would
be
the
first
aid
i
should
well
you
know
your
own
affairs
best
said
pimpernel
and
so
there
was
no
more
said
about
it
but
brain
was
set
to
work
as
it
had
never
yet
been
what
if
there
might
be
evidence
after
all
something
the
old
squire
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
use
arden
was
worth
a
great
deal
of
exertion
even
a
little
treachery
and
of
course
if
edgar
was
not
a
real
arden
it
would
be
a
duty
to
the
race
to
cast
him
out
a
duty
to
the
race
and
a
duty
to
himself
duty
to
self
is
a
very
prevailing
principle
there
is
not
much
about
it
in
the
canons
of
christianity
but
there
is
a
great
deal
about
it
in
the
practical
laws
which
govern
the
world
arthur
was
vaguely
excited
by
this
unexpected
proposal
he
was
not
lawyer
enough
to
know
much
of
the
possibilities
or
impossibilities
of
the
matter
but
it
was
worth
thinking
about
worth
inquiring
into
surely
if
anything
ever
was
chapter
viii
it
was
with
this
idea
strong
in
his
mind
that
arthur
marked
out
for
himself
a
certain
scheme
of
operations
during
his
stay
at
the
red
house
he
had
still
ten
days
to
remain
there
and
time
it
must
be
allowed
hung
sometimes
heavy
on
his
hands
to
play
croquet
with
devotion
for
several
hours
every
day
requires
a
mind
free
from
agitation
and
innocent
of
scheming
or
at
least
not
burdened
with
schemes
which
are
very
important
or
any
warm
personal
anxiety
in
the
bigger
game
of
life
alice
pimpernel
was
good
for
two
hours
in
the
morning
with
her
little
sisters
when
they
had
done
their
lessons
and
arden
felt
that
it
was
a
very
pretty
group
on
the
first
day
of
his
visit
when
he
looked
up
from
his
newspaper
and
let
his
eyes
stray
over
the
lawn
with
its
background
of
trees
and
all
the
airy
figures
in
their
light
dresses
that
were
standing
about
but
then
alice
was
good
also
for
four
hours
in
the
afternoon
when
there
was
nothing
better
going
on
namely
from
two
when
luncheon
was
just
over
till
six
when
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
young
denbigh
by
right
of
his
youth
was
equal
to
this
long
continued
enjoyment
but
arthur
was
not
equal
to
it
and
as
at
that
moment
there
were
no
other
visitors
at
the
red
house
time
was
hard
to
kill
he
felt
that
if
he
had
been
a
little
younger
he
would
have
been
driven
in
self
defence
to
make
love
to
somebody
alice
or
her
mother
it
did
not
much
matter
which
but
it
was
too
great
a
bore
with
all
his
anxieties
on
his
mind
and
with
the
amount
of
real
feeling
he
had
in
respect
to
clare
accordingly
it
was
rather
a
godsend
to
him
when
pimpernel
threw
this
suggestion
into
his
mind
he
did
not
take
it
up
with
any
active
feeling
of
enmity
to
edgar
nor
even
with
any
great
hope
of
success
if
it
were
as
he
thought
the
squire
had
either
been
uncertain
to
the
last
of
his
guilt
or
he
had
been
sufficiently
infatuated
to
accept
the
consequences
finally
and
irredeemably
in
which
latter
case
no
doubt
he
must
have
destroyed
any
evidence
that
existed
against
her
while
in
the
former
case
there
could
have
been
no
evidence
sufficiently
strong
to
convict
her
in
either
point
of
view
it
was
madness
after
all
this
lapse
of
time
to
attempt
to
make
any
discoveries
yet
arthur
made
up
his
mind
to
try
to
do
so
with
a
resolution
which
grew
stronger
the
more
he
thought
of
it
and
from
this
moment
he
thought
of
little
else
he
had
believed
his
own
hypothesis
steadily
for
so
many
years
and
it
was
so
much
to
his
interest
to
believe
it
if
proof
of
any
description
could
be
found
he
strolled
down
to
the
village
next
morning
not
knowing
exactly
what
he
wanted
and
stopped
at
old
cottage
and
beguiled
her
into
conversation
jeanie
he
noted
had
been
sent
away
at
his
approach
and
this
fact
alone
determined
him
to
see
jeanie
he
went
upstairs
again
undaunted
by
the
experience
of
yesterday
and
knocked
softly
at
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
murray
he
said
from
the
landing
not
even
presuming
to
enter
have
something
to
say
to
sarah
and
i
can
not
manage
it
below
with
these
two
girls
listening
and
staring
would
it
disturb
you
to
let
us
come
up
here
there
was
a
pause
and
a
little
rustle
as
of
movement
and
telegraphed
communications
before
any
answer
was
made
to
him
and
then
arthur
smiled
to
find
that
his
appeal
to
scotch
politeness
was
not
made
in
vain
in
sir
murray
said
gravely
jeanie
was
seated
at
the
open
window
with
her
needlework
and
her
grandmother
in
her
usual
place
by
the
table
engaged
in
her
usual
occupation
of
knitting
a
seat
sir
leave
you
to
yourselves
said
murray
but
this
did
not
suit
arthur
who
even
in
the
midst
of
a
new
interest
loved
to
have
two
strings
to
his
bow
no
means
he
said
i
have
to
say
may
be
said
quite
well
before
you
i
have
to
put
a
question
or
two
about
my
cousins
at
the
hall
here
is
a
chair
for
you
sarah
sit
down
and
be
frightened
nothing
is
going
to
happen
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
you
know
about
arden
that
is
could
i
know
aught
about
arden
arthur
said
sarah
wonderingly
she
died
afore
i
come
i
took
miss
clare
from
a
baby
but
her
poor
dear
mamma
was
dead
and
gone
my
brother
simon
he
knows
and
so
do
the
rector
and
poor
miss
letty
at
the
but
i
know
no
more
than
this
good
lady
as
is
a
stranger
to
the
place
her
name
on
the
stone
top
of
pew
in
and
all
as
i
there
none
of
the
old
servants
about
that
knew
her
asked
arthur
at
which
point
a
very
strange
interruption
ensued
canna
tell
sir
why
you
are
asking
or
if
it
is
for
good
or
evil
said
murray
dinna
belong
to
the
place
as
sarah
says
nor
no
one
that
ought
to
ken
but
i
have
seen
arden
if
its
about
her
ye
want
to
ken
have
seen
arden
said
arthur
in
amazement
and
old
sarah
echoed
his
exclamation
i
have
seen
her
no
often
but
more
than
once
if
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
what
like
she
was
and
all
i
ken
about
her
or
if
not
all
she
was
ill
in
health
and
troubled
in
spirit
poor
thing
when
i
saw
her
i
can
not
think
she
was
ever
either
strong
or
that
after
her
children
were
born
asked
arthur
eagerly
was
before
she
had
any
bairn
it
was
thought
she
never
would
have
one
and
her
husband
was
sore
disturbed
but
ye
see
the
doctors
turned
out
fools
as
they
do
so
often
murray
added
hastily
turning
and
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
she
made
a
pause
between
the
two
sentences
and
changed
her
tone
completely
the
first
was
mere
reminiscence
the
other
had
a
certain
defiance
in
it
and
arthur
felt
there
was
some
meaning
though
one
he
could
not
read
in
the
suddenly
watchful
expression
of
her
eyes
he
said
thoughtfully
it
and
as
he
spoke
the
watchfulness
went
off
face
and
she
evidently
though
why
he
could
not
think
calmed
herself
down
it
appears
he
repeated
vaguely
was
some
time
married
then
i
suppose
before
my
cousin
edgar
was
born
have
heard
say
five
years
said
the
old
woman
once
more
rousing
up
with
a
watchful
light
in
each
steady
eye
then
impossible
he
said
to
himself
an
idea
had
been
growing
in
mind
that
the
wife
might
have
been
a
widow
with
an
infant
child
an
explanation
which
would
make
everything
clear
yet
save
her
from
the
imputation
of
a
capital
crime
in
respect
to
her
husband
that
was
impossible
he
mused
on
it
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
he
resumed
his
questions
was
arden
i
am
anxious
to
know
he
said
and
then
corrected
himself
for
his
tone
had
been
peremptory
am
thinking
of
the
family
history
he
added
was
a
stranger
and
we
know
even
where
she
belongs
to
that
will
explain
my
curiosity
to
you
i
am
anxious
to
was
arden
when
i
saw
her
and
i
ken
nothing
more
said
the
scotchwoman
shortly
and
again
he
noted
that
her
interest
had
failed
evidently
she
knew
something
which
it
might
possibly
concern
him
much
to
know
but
what
kind
of
knowledge
it
was
remained
a
mystery
to
him
he
had
not
even
light
enough
on
the
subject
to
guide
him
as
to
what
questions
he
ought
to
put
to
her
old
sarah
sat
gazing
and
full
of
wonder
only
little
jeanie
took
no
interest
in
the
inquiry
she
sat
at
the
window
now
dreaming
now
working
sometimes
playing
with
a
long
tendril
of
the
honeysuckle
sometimes
pausing
to
look
out
from
the
window
the
talk
was
nothing
to
her
and
interest
flagged
as
this
pretty
figure
caught
his
eye
why
should
he
attempt
to
find
out
anything
about
mother
what
difference
could
it
ever
make
to
him
whereas
here
was
a
human
plaything
which
it
would
be
pleasant
to
toy
with
which
would
amuse
and
distract
him
in
the
midst
of
his
cares
what
a
pretty
little
thing
she
was
much
prettier
than
alice
pimpernel
in
some
things
even
more
attractive
than
clare
ah
clare
this
thought
brought
him
back
to
his
original
subject
but
yet
the
other
thought
was
in
his
mind
and
found
expression
first
daughter
seems
better
he
said
think
she
is
frightened
for
me
now
are
you
jeanie
you
know
i
am
a
friend
now
the
man
must
have
been
a
wretch
who
frightened
such
a
sensitive
sweet
little
creature
i
think
he
can
have
been
like
did
ye
speak
said
jeanie
with
a
start
and
she
turned
to
him
an
innocent
unconscious
face
moved
with
a
little
wonder
only
at
the
sound
of
her
name
the
gentleman
did
not
speak
to
you
said
her
grandmother
ben
the
house
my
darling
where
you
will
be
quiet
and
away
from
all
clashes
sir
my
bairn
is
jeanie
to
her
own
folk
she
added
as
the
docile
girl
withdrew
into
the
inner
room
no
to
every
stranger
that
hears
her
innocent
name
it
will
be
kindest
of
you
not
to
speak
to
her
the
attack
might
come
suppose
you
know
your
own
business
best
said
arthur
shrugging
his
shoulders
you
seem
very
foolish
about
the
child
how
can
i
hurt
her
by
speaking
to
her
to
return
to
arden
she
was
scotch
i
suppose
as
you
knew
her
so
well
was
not
scotch
that
ever
i
heard
and
i
did
not
know
her
well
said
murray
and
then
there
was
a
pause
tell
me
what
you
have
to
do
with
it
and
what
you
want
to
know
i
will
answer
you
if
i
can
give
you
any
information
she
said
with
decision
may
not
know
what
you
want
to
hear
but
if
tell
me
what
you
have
to
do
with
it
am
only
the
nearest
relation
that
arden
and
his
sister
have
in
the
world
said
arthur
in
spite
of
himself
shrinking
from
her
eye
the
heir
if
this
bonnie
lad
should
die
or
fail
this
was
spoken
with
an
eagerness
which
puzzled
him
more
and
more
he
felt
that
he
was
put
on
his
defence
and
yet
there
was
no
indignation
in
her
look
it
was
guilt
of
conscience
that
startled
him
and
brought
the
colour
to
his
cheek
he
said
crimson
and
angry
with
consciousness
then
my
cousin
is
much
younger
and
more
likely
to
live
than
i
am
nothing
can
be
more
unlikely
than
that
i
should
be
his
heir
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
i
want
to
younger
than
you
and
far
liker
to
live
strong
and
got
a
constitution
that
will
bear
trouble
should
ken
she
said
under
her
breath
whispering
to
herself
and
then
she
too
coloured
and
faced
him
with
a
certain
gleam
of
fear
in
her
eyes
she
repeated
a
bonnie
lad
bless
him
and
real
well
and
strong
no
likely
ever
live
to
be
his
is
unnecessary
to
remind
me
of
that
i
just
said
it
said
arthur
hastily
trust
live
a
hundred
years
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
hundred
years
said
old
sarah
a
great
age
i
an
man
up
thornleigh
way
but
bless
you
young
and
strong
as
like
as
not
live
to
a
hundred
i
never
heard
as
anything
the
matter
all
his
life
it
would
be
a
credit
to
the
family
i
do
declare
so
it
would
said
arthur
with
a
smile
of
disdain
you
need
not
be
afraid
he
went
on
turning
again
to
murray
am
ten
years
older
than
he
is
i
am
a
poor
devil
without
a
penny
and
he
has
everything
never
mind
i
am
going
to
write
a
book
about
the
family
and
that
will
make
me
rich
i
do
your
favourite
any
harm
he
everything
said
the
scotchwoman
earnestly
no
think
me
presuming
arden
but
i
would
like
to
hear
no
fair
to
the
rest
when
everything
goes
to
one
i
canna
think
it
is
fair
he
should
share
with
you
a
bit
of
the
land
or
some
of
the
siller
or
one
thing
or
another
and
you
as
sib
to
the
race
as
he
i
would
like
well
to
ken
is
very
good
of
you
to
take
my
interest
so
much
to
heart
said
arthur
with
a
certain
contempt
which
was
not
unmixed
with
bitterness
nothing
comes
to
me
one
cousin
is
a
prince
and
one
is
a
beggar
the
way
of
the
world
so
you
tell
me
name
nor
anything
about
her
friends
or
her
family
had
she
any
one
with
her
except
her
husband
when
you
made
her
acquaintance
what
kind
of
a
woman
did
you
take
her
to
be
ken
neither
her
name
nor
her
kin
nor
nought
about
her
they
were
travelling
and
no
a
creature
with
them
no
even
a
maid
but
there
might
be
reasons
she
was
a
young
sorrowful
thing
sore
broken
down
with
a
tyrant
of
a
man
that
is
all
i
can
tell
and
whatever
was
done
good
or
evil
was
his
doing
and
not
hers
it
was
him
that
did
and
said
and
settled
everything
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
does
not
sound
much
said
arthur
with
an
accent
of
discontent
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
certain
gleam
of
relief
shot
across
her
face
yet
you
look
as
if
you
could
tell
me
more
he
added
with
a
suspicion
which
he
could
not
explain
she
eyed
him
as
a
man
fighting
a
duel
might
regard
his
adversary
who
had
just
fired
upon
him
but
made
no
reply
a
maid
now
strange
cried
old
sarah
is
the
strangest
of
all
saving
presence
and
them
very
words
clears
it
all
up
to
me
as
wondered
and
wondered
many
a
day
if
madam
as
was
poor
soul
had
been
a
lady
like
the
other
ladies
there
would
have
been
a
deal
more
things
for
miss
clare
she
got
anything
of
her
the
dear
most
young
ladies
they
have
their
rings
or
her
jewels
or
something
they
tell
you
this
was
my
or
this
was
my
or
such
like
but
miss
clare
she
a
thing
and
travelling
with
a
maid
she
a
lady
born
madam
arden
as
clear
as
clear
canna
tell
ye
who
she
was
she
was
a
thing
said
murray
with
some
solemnity
what
was
done
in
her
life
if
it
was
good
or
if
it
was
evil
it
wasna
her
this
was
all
arthur
arden
made
of
his
first
investigation
he
was
working
in
the
dark
he
went
away
a
short
time
after
leaving
sarah
full
of
excited
questions
to
which
she
received
very
scanty
response
he
was
a
little
excited
himself
he
could
not
tell
why
this
woman
was
a
relation
of
which
of
course
he
supposed
explained
her
acquaintance
with
his
mother
but
still
she
was
a
strange
woman
and
knew
something
he
was
sure
that
might
be
of
use
to
him
if
he
could
only
find
out
what
it
was
what
could
it
be
could
she
have
been
maid
and
in
her
secrets
or
had
the
proud
squire
married
some
one
beneath
him
some
one
probably
connected
with
this
stranger
it
was
all
quite
dark
and
no
thread
to
be
found
in
the
gloom
was
it
worth
his
while
to
try
to
penetrate
that
gloom
and
he
would
have
liked
to
see
little
jeanie
before
he
left
the
pretty
creature
he
would
rather
have
questioned
her
than
her
grandmother
what
could
the
old
woman
mean
by
keeping
her
so
persistently
out
of
his
way
chapter
ix
arthur
arden
strayed
through
the
village
street
in
the
stillness
of
the
summer
afternoon
after
this
bewildering
interview
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
to
do
to
carry
on
his
researches
probably
he
might
light
upon
some
chance
information
in
one
of
the
cottages
where
there
were
people
old
enough
to
have
known
mother
but
this
was
utterly
uncertain
and
he
might
be
committing
himself
for
no
use
in
the
world
if
he
went
to
the
rector
or
the
doctor
he
might
commit
himself
still
more
and
rouse
their
curiosity
as
to
his
motives
in
an
uncomfortable
way
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
find
out
accidentally
to
discover
without
searching
a
secret
if
there
was
a
secret
which
must
have
been
carefully
hidden
for
years
the
chance
of
success
was
infinitesimal
and
failure
seemed
almost
certain
probably
everything
that
could
throw
any
light
on
the
subject
had
been
destroyed
long
since
and
then
if
he
injured
edgar
what
of
clare
was
support
worth
enmity
this
however
was
a
question
he
did
not
dwell
on
for
arthur
satisfied
himself
that
clare
had
no
need
to
know
unless
by
some
strange
chance
he
should
be
successful
and
if
he
were
successful
she
was
not
one
to
stand
in
the
way
of
justice
but
there
was
not
the
very
slightest
chance
that
he
would
be
successful
it
was
simply
impossible
he
laughed
at
himself
as
he
strolled
along
idly
if
there
had
been
anything
better
than
croquet
to
do
at
the
red
house
he
would
have
gone
back
to
that
and
left
this
chase
alone
but
in
the
meantime
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
at
the
worst
his
inquiries
could
do
no
harm
the
church
was
open
and
he
strolled
in
old
simon
the
clerk
was
about
heavily
pattering
in
a
dark
corner
it
was
saturday
and
sally
had
been
helping
her
father
to
clean
the
church
she
had
gone
home
to
her
needlework
but
he
still
pattered
about
at
the
west
end
unseen
in
the
gloom
putting
as
might
be
supposed
from
the
sound
his
dusters
and
brooms
away
in
some
old
ecclesiastical
cupboard
he
had
clogs
on
which
made
a
great
noise
and
the
utter
stillness
and
shady
quiet
of
the
place
was
strangely
enhanced
by
the
sound
of
those
heavy
footsteps
arthur
walked
down
the
length
of
the
church
which
echoed
even
under
his
lighter
tread
the
light
in
it
was
green
and
subdued
coming
through
the
foliage
and
the
dim
small
panes
which
replaced
the
old
painted
glass
in
the
windows
here
and
there
a
broken
bit
of
colour
a
morsel
of
brilliant
ruby
out
of
some
mantle
or
a
warm
effective
bit
of
interrupted
the
colourless
light
arden
church
had
been
a
fine
church
in
the
ancient
days
and
there
were
tombs
in
the
gloom
in
the
corners
near
the
chancel
which
were
reckoned
very
fine
still
when
anybody
who
knew
anything
about
it
came
to
see
them
but
knowledge
had
not
made
much
inroad
as
yet
in
the
neighbourhood
the
old
squire
had
not
been
the
kind
of
man
to
spend
money
in
restoring
a
church
and
mr
fielding
had
not
been
the
kind
of
man
to
worry
his
life
out
about
it
should
young
denbigh
survive
the
croquet
and
succeed
the
rector
it
was
probable
that
edgar
would
not
have
half
so
easy
a
time
in
this
respect
as
his
father
had
been
allowed
to
have
but
in
the
meantime
there
had
been
no
restoration
and
there
were
even
some
high
pews
in
which
the
principal
people
hid
themselves
on
sundays
the
pew
was
like
a
box
at
the
theatre
with
open
arches
of
carved
oak
and
a
fireplace
in
it
behind
the
chairs
and
a
private
passage
which
led
into
the
park
the
impression
which
the
church
made
upon
arthur
arden
however
was
neither
sacred
nor
historical
he
did
not
think
of
it
as
associated
for
all
those
hundred
years
with
the
fortunes
of
his
race
neither
still
less
did
he
think
of
it
as
for
all
this
time
the
centre
of
prayer
and
worship
the
place
where
so
many
hearts
had
risen
to
god
all
he
thought
was
what
a
curious
ghostly
look
all
those
unoccupied
seats
had
the
quiet
about
was
almost
more
than
quiet
it
was
a
hush
as
if
of
forced
stillness
a
something
in
the
air
that
made
him
feel
as
if
all
the
seats
were
full
though
nobody
was
visible
and
some
unseen
ceremonial
going
on
and
the
old
man
in
his
clogs
went
clamping
clattering
about
in
the
green
dimness
under
cover
of
the
organ
gallery
white
smock
was
visible
now
and
then
toned
down
to
a
ghostly
grey
by
the
absence
of
light
arthur
arden
felt
half
afraid
of
him
as
he
walked
slowly
up
the
aisle
he
might
have
been
the
family
brownie
a
homely
ghost
that
watched
over
the
graves
and
manes
of
the
ardens
which
arthur
though
an
arden
meditated
a
certain
desecration
of
these
however
were
sentiments
not
long
likely
to
move
the
mind
of
such
a
man
he
walked
slowly
up
until
he
found
himself
opposite
the
pew
it
was
quite
near
the
chancel
close
to
the
pulpit
which
stood
on
one
side
and
opposite
the
reading
desk
which
stood
on
the
other
like
two
sentinels
watching
the
approach
to
the
altar
on
the
wall
of
the
church
almost
on
a
parallel
with
where
the
head
must
have
come
when
he
sat
in
his
pew
was
the
white
marble
tablet
that
bore
his
name
it
was
a
heavy
plain
square
tablet
not
apt
to
attract
any
attention
and
arthur
who
when
he
was
in
arden
church
had
always
been
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
stage
box
had
scarcely
remarked
it
at
all
he
paused
now
and
read
it
as
it
glimmered
in
the
dim
silence
wife
of
arthur
arden
of
that
was
all
the
arden
arms
were
on
the
tablet
but
without
any
quartering
that
could
have
belonged
to
the
dead
woman
evidently
she
was
the
wife
only
with
no
other
distinction
while
he
stood
thinking
on
this
another
step
entered
the
church
and
looking
round
arthur
saw
mr
fielding
who
after
a
few
words
with
old
simon
came
and
joined
him
are
looking
at
the
old
pew
the
rector
said
in
the
subdued
tone
that
became
the
sacred
place
tell
me
it
ought
not
to
be
a
pew
at
all
if
i
took
a
proper
interest
in
christian
art
but
it
will
last
my
time
i
think
i
should
prefer
that
it
lasted
my
time
i
never
was
brought
up
in
these
was
not
looking
at
the
pew
but
at
that
said
arthur
pointing
to
the
wall
it
is
very
bad
i
suppose
said
mr
fielding
are
very
far
behind
i
know
in
art
ugly
i
confess
but
do
you
know
i
like
it
all
the
same
when
the
church
gets
dark
in
a
wintry
afternoon
these
white
tablets
glimmer
you
would
think
there
were
angels
holding
them
up
and
after
all
to
me
who
am
far
advanced
in
life
such
names
are
sweeter
than
the
finest
monuments
it
is
different
of
course
with
you
younger
was
not
thinking
of
art
said
arthur
of
the
curt
way
the
name
is
put
wife
of
arthur
was
she
daughter
she
got
a
name
before
she
was
married
dying
so
young
one
would
think
some
one
must
have
been
living
who
had
an
interest
in
her
but
there
is
neither
blazon
nor
what
i
see
anything
remarkable
in
that
said
mr
fielding
others
are
just
the
same
they
i
remember
i
am
sure
wife
of
arthur
yes
that
is
all
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
remember
name
i
never
knew
what
family
she
belonged
to
they
were
married
their
son
was
born
abroad
was
not
that
strange
said
arthur
seems
to
have
been
a
great
deal
of
mystery
about
it
one
way
and
another
not
much
like
the
arden
have
been
listening
to
somers
said
mr
fielding
hotly
old
cynic
as
he
is
he
has
taken
up
his
notion
and
nothing
will
make
him
give
it
up
if
you
had
known
arden
as
i
did
you
would
have
scouted
such
an
idea
i
never
knew
a
better
woman
she
had
dreadfully
bad
health
that
the
reason
why
they
were
so
much
abroad
tell
why
they
were
so
much
abroad
said
the
rector
testily
they
liked
it
i
suppose
and
let
me
tell
you
it
would
have
been
better
for
all
the
ardens
had
they
been
more
abroad
i
suppose
there
never
was
a
more
bigoted
race
to
be
sure
you
are
one
of
them
and
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
it
to
you
but
you
have
knocked
about
the
world
and
you
know
them
as
well
as
i
do
knew
only
the
old
squire
said
arthur
my
own
father
of
course
but
he
had
knocked
about
the
world
enough
there
was
not
much
love
lost
between
them
i
think
hated
each
other
my
dear
sir
they
hated
each
other
said
the
rector
and
then
he
paused
and
wiped
his
forehead
as
if
it
had
been
too
much
for
him
beg
your
pardon
i
am
sure
for
calling
up
family
matters
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
on
such
different
terms
with
the
young
people
here
said
arthur
with
a
half
sigh
is
the
use
of
keeping
up
rancour
the
old
squire
on
the
whole
was
rather
kind
to
me
i
suppose
it
was
enough
for
him
to
have
one
arden
to
hate
and
as
he
transferred
the
feeling
from
my
father
to
his
own
son
hush
hush
said
the
rector
anxiously
let
us
rake
up
old
troubles
thank
heaven
poor
edgar
is
very
comfortable
now
his
father
do
him
any
tangible
injustice
you
know
though
that
business
about
old
arden
was
very
shameful
very
shameful
there
is
no
other
word
for
it
to
take
advantage
of
the
ignorance
to
break
the
entail
and
then
to
settle
the
very
oldest
of
the
property
on
clare
i
love
clare
dearly
if
she
was
my
own
child
i
could
not
love
her
more
but
rather
than
take
that
from
my
brother
i
would
strip
myself
of
every
penny
if
i
were
in
her
place
it
was
shameful
there
is
no
other
word
cousin
is
much
more
of
an
arden
than
her
brother
said
arthur
see
why
she
should
strip
herself
of
every
penny
surely
he
has
enough
she
is
twice
as
much
of
an
arden
as
what
is
an
arden
i
should
like
to
know
said
mr
fielding
be
kept
up
at
such
a
cost
edgar
is
not
much
of
an
arden
poor
boy
he
is
worth
a
dozen
of
any
ardens
i
ever
knew
forget
i
am
one
of
that
unfortunate
race
said
arthur
with
a
forced
laugh
no
harm
i
know
you
love
us
less
but
only
him
more
and
my
cousin
clare
is
an
arden
he
added
after
a
pause
her
i
must
make
a
stand
even
beside
her
excellence
you
would
still
allow
her
a
place
i
love
clare
dearly
said
the
rector
with
abrupt
brevity
and
then
there
was
a
pause
arthur
arden
smiled
to
himself
a
smile
which
might
very
well
have
been
a
sneer
what
did
it
matter
what
the
old
opinions
were
the
ardens
could
stand
a
harder
judgment
than
his
about
this
poor
lady
he
said
was
a
perfect
creature
you
say
and
i
want
to
contradict
you
probably
she
was
everything
that
was
good
and
lovely
but
i
suppose
a
woman
of
no
family
from
the
evidence
of
this
record
here
know
anything
about
her
family
said
mr
fielding
shortly
never
occurred
to
me
to
think
what
her
family
this
he
said
with
some
heat
and
energy
probably
because
it
was
and
alas
the
good
rector
knew
it
was
a
considerable
fib
time
was
when
he
had
asked
a
great
deal
about
family
as
indeed
everybody
in
the
county
had
done
but
without
gaining
any
information
the
rector
was
angry
with
himself
for
the
fib
but
still
maintained
it
with
a
certain
irritation
as
it
was
natural
for
a
man
to
do
is
a
pity
there
should
be
so
much
mystery
said
arthur
quietly
of
course
he
saw
through
the
fiction
with
the
utmost
distinctness
but
civility
required
that
he
should
take
no
further
notice
and
then
the
two
stood
together
for
a
minute
or
perhaps
two
in
the
narrow
aisle
pretending
to
look
round
them
and
making
a
critical
survey
of
the
church
tomb
is
fine
if
one
could
see
it
arthur
said
pointing
to
a
recumbent
figure
of
an
old
arden
and
mr
fielding
assented
with
a
little
nod
of
his
head
and
all
this
time
old
simon
in
his
clogs
with
the
smock
that
looked
in
the
dimness
was
clamping
slowly
about
stirring
the
slumbrous
silent
echoes
how
strange
it
was
so
real
and
living
and
full
of
so
many
seeds
of
excitement
yet
all
the
time
like
something
in
a
dream
the
rector
however
accompanied
arthur
out
with
pertinacity
seeing
him
as
it
were
the
as
if
there
could
have
been
anything
to
find
out
in
the
little
innocent
church
which
all
the
world
was
free
to
inspect
was
it
to
keep
him
from
talking
to
old
simon
who
however
knew
nothing
or
was
it
from
mere
wantonness
of
opposition
the
latter
was
really
the
case
though
it
was
difficult
even
to
make
out
how
mr
fielding
was
stimulated
into
opposition
he
must
have
felt
it
in
the
air
by
some
curious
magnetic
antipathy
for
arthur
had
not
said
a
word
so
far
as
he
was
aware
to
betray
himself
they
walked
together
as
far
as
the
hall
gates
talking
of
various
indifferent
matters
at
the
red
house
said
mr
fielding
with
a
smile
of
strange
satisfaction
miss
arden
know
the
rector
was
pleased
with
this
bit
of
information
he
was
glad
of
anything
which
would
set
their
kinsman
wrong
with
the
brother
and
sister
it
was
a
highly
unchristian
sentiment
but
so
it
was
she
knows
said
arthur
quietly
met
her
yesterday
and
i
am
going
to
call
there
now
i
suppose
as
clare
is
my
cousin
and
i
am
old
enough
to
be
her
father
i
may
be
permitted
to
call
i
suppose
you
are
old
enough
to
be
her
father
mr
fielding
said
with
most
provoking
acquiescence
arthur
could
have
knocked
the
rector
down
had
he
given
way
to
his
feelings
after
all
though
there
was
a
good
deal
of
difference
in
point
of
age
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
have
been
father
and
he
did
not
feel
like
her
father
in
the
smallest
degree
the
rector
paused
at
the
hall
gates
and
looked
at
his
watch
to
see
if
he
had
time
also
to
pay
a
visit
to
clare
but
to
intense
relief
the
came
running
across
from
the
rectory
as
mr
fielding
hesitated
some
one
who
was
ill
had
sent
for
the
rector
some
one
who
lived
two
miles
off
and
who
had
sent
so
urgent
an
appeal
that
jack
had
already
put
the
saddle
on
his
sturdy
old
cob
shall
have
to
put
it
off
till
mr
fielding
said
with
a
sigh
clare
i
shall
see
her
but
alas
he
thought
to
himself
an
antidote
given
hours
after
the
poison
what
good
is
it
and
he
could
not
forbid
her
own
cousin
to
pay
her
a
visit
so
mr
fielding
turned
away
with
a
bad
grace
to
visit
his
sick
parishioner
and
arthur
much
relieved
opened
the
little
postern
gate
and
took
his
way
under
the
great
elms
and
beeches
to
the
hall
chapter
clare
was
all
alone
when
arthur
reached
the
hall
she
had
been
all
alone
the
whole
day
she
had
not
even
received
a
letter
from
anybody
to
help
her
through
its
long
hours
she
had
looked
after
her
accounts
and
arranged
something
for
the
schools
and
answered
an
application
which
some
one
in
liverpool
had
made
in
respect
to
one
of
the
girls
whom
old
sarah
had
trained
and
then
she
sat
down
and
read
for
and
then
rose
and
stood
for
ten
minutes
at
the
window
and
then
had
taken
her
and
then
gone
to
the
window
again
from
that
window
the
view
was
very
fair
it
would
have
lightened
the
burden
off
the
shoulders
of
many
a
careworn
man
and
woman
only
to
have
been
able
to
go
and
look
at
it
from
time
to
time
in
the
midst
of
their
work
there
were
the
woods
in
all
their
summer
wealth
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
and
under
their
shade
a
gleam
of
water
catching
the
sunshine
water
which
was
one
of
the
charms
of
arden
a
series
of
old
threaded
upon
the
thin
silvery
string
of
a
little
stream
it
glimmered
here
and
it
glimmered
there
through
the
rich
foliage
and
now
and
then
the
elms
and
beeches
stood
apart
as
it
were
drawing
their
leafy
skirts
about
them
to
open
a
green
glade
all
brightened
up
with
a
flash
of
that
fairy
water
and
between
the
window
and
the
wood
was
the
great
wealthy
stretch
of
immemorial
turf
the
park
with
here
and
there
a
huge
tree
standing
with
modest
consciousness
by
itself
a
champion
of
the
sylvan
world
people
had
been
heard
to
say
that
the
mere
sight
of
all
that
lordly
silent
scene
so
profuse
in
its
verdure
so
splendid
in
its
space
and
freedom
was
enough
to
drive
care
and
pain
far
from
arden
nothing
knew
nature
there
of
pain
or
evil
she
lay
and
contemplated
herself
wrapped
in
a
holy
divine
content
listening
to
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
taking
thought
for
the
innumerable
tiny
lives
that
buzzed
and
fluttered
in
the
air
watching
the
grasses
grow
and
the
little
fish
leap
it
was
all
very
lovely
and
to
clare
it
was
dear
as
only
such
a
home
can
be
but
when
she
went
to
the
window
her
heart
grew
sick
of
the
silence
and
the
calm
oh
only
for
a
little
movement
and
commotion
a
storm
would
have
been
better
than
nothing
but
still
a
storm
would
only
have
moved
these
great
strong
unsympathetic
trees
it
could
not
have
given
the
she
wanted
to
clare
herself
who
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
had
ceased
to
be
no
not
longing
for
anything
it
did
not
matter
what
to
disturb
the
stagnation
about
her
how
different
it
had
been
before
edgar
came
home
even
when
she
was
absorbed
by
her
first
grief
for
her
father
time
did
not
hang
heavy
on
her
hands
once
before
it
is
true
a
similar
feeling
had
come
over
her
after
arthur
arden
went
away
the
first
time
clare
clasped
her
hands
together
and
blushed
crimson
with
sudden
shame
when
she
identified
the
previous
moment
at
which
she
had
felt
lonely
and
weary
of
everything
as
she
was
now
violent
shame
seized
upon
her
though
there
was
nobody
to
see
even
if
any
one
could
have
seen
into
her
mind
and
surprised
the
unspoken
thought
and
then
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
weary
window
and
represented
to
herself
that
the
misery
of
that
former
time
had
passed
away
time
had
gone
on
and
other
thoughts
had
come
in
and
it
had
passed
away
a
little
patience
and
again
it
would
pass
away
now
everything
does
in
this
world
experience
was
not
great
but
yet
even
she
knew
something
of
that
terrible
tranquillising
force
of
time
how
wretched
she
had
been
about
edgar
again
and
again
during
those
years
when
he
had
been
absent
and
her
father
never
mentioned
his
name
but
these
wretchednesses
had
all
floated
away
one
after
another
and
when
the
squire
died
it
had
seemed
to
clare
that
she
never
could
get
beyond
that
sense
of
desolation
which
filled
the
house
and
all
the
familiar
scenes
in
which
he
had
been
the
first
figure
but
she
had
got
over
it
she
had
not
forgotten
her
father
her
memory
of
him
was
so
vivid
that
she
could
think
she
saw
him
could
think
she
heard
him
so
clear
in
her
recollection
were
his
voice
and
his
face
and
yet
the
world
was
no
longer
desolate
because
he
was
not
there
it
was
a
curious
train
of
thought
for
a
girl
of
her
age
but
clare
was
very
reasonable
and
she
was
very
much
alone
with
nobody
in
the
world
to
whom
she
could
legitimately
go
for
consolation
she
had
no
mother
into
whose
ear
she
could
pour
her
woes
she
had
been
compelled
to
be
a
mother
to
herself
and
thus
as
if
she
had
been
her
own
mother
she
represented
to
herself
that
this
pain
also
would
pass
away
in
time
let
her
but
occupy
herself
keep
doing
something
bear
it
as
patiently
and
think
as
little
about
it
as
possible
and
in
time
it
would
come
to
an
end
this
is
a
hard
painful
inhuman
way
of
consoling
self
but
yet
when
one
is
alone
and
has
nobody
else
to
breathe
a
word
of
comfort
perhaps
it
is
as
good
a
way
as
any
will
not
last
she
said
to
herself
is
miserable
now
and
shameful
and
i
hate
myself
to
think
that
should
feel
like
that
but
one
has
only
to
be
patient
and
put
up
with
it
it
can
not
and
she
had
just
fed
herself
with
this
philosophy
and
taken
what
nourishment
she
could
out
of
it
when
all
her
loneliness
and
miserableness
and
philosophisings
were
put
to
flight
in
a
moment
arthur
arden
was
ushered
in
solemnly
by
wilkins
who
had
half
a
mind
to
remain
himself
to
make
sure
that
the
rules
of
perfect
propriety
were
observed
and
all
at
once
the
tedium
and
the
unprofitableness
departed
out
of
life
but
she
would
have
given
her
life
as
was
perfectly
natural
rather
than
let
him
see
that
his
arrival
was
anything
to
her
am
taking
advantage
of
absence
to
do
quantities
of
things
she
said
looking
into
his
face
away
my
old
pieces
of
work
no
perhaps
i
was
never
very
fond
of
work
i
have
always
had
so
many
other
things
to
thanks
i
heard
from
him
yesterday
edgar
is
quite
hope
he
is
enjoying
himself
in
town
said
arthur
subduing
himself
to
her
tone
talks
only
of
the
thornleighs
said
clare
with
that
familiar
pucker
in
her
brow
pretending
to
be
anxious
about
edgar
was
so
much
more
easy
than
adopting
that
air
of
absolute
calm
for
herself
course
i
know
i
ought
to
be
very
glad
that
he
has
chosen
such
nice
friends
there
is
nothing
to
object
to
in
the
thornleighs
still
to
go
to
town
only
to
see
them
when
he
can
see
them
as
much
as
he
pleases
at
home
augusta
i
should
think
likes
to
have
such
a
captive
at
her
said
arthur
much
anxiety
it
must
cost
you
poor
dear
arden
what
a
pity
he
knows
so
little
of
the
my
brother
will
do
very
well
said
clare
with
a
sensitive
movement
of
offence
and
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
safest
to
carry
the
war
into
the
other
camp
should
like
to
know
how
you
get
on
at
the
red
house
she
said
pimpernel
is
quite
pretty
i
think
is
she
always
buttoning
her
glove
i
hear
they
play
croquet
a
great
deal
are
you
fond
of
croquet
arden
if
you
are
it
must
have
been
so
dull
for
you
never
having
it
while
you
were
hate
croquet
he
said
almost
rudely
but
clare
was
not
offended
hope
the
man
who
invented
it
died
a
violent
death
miss
arden
i
know
i
have
put
myself
in
a
false
position
by
going
to
visit
the
pimpernels
no
indeed
no
not
at
all
said
clare
with
majestic
suavity
should
not
you
visit
them
if
you
like
them
i
object
to
visiting
that
sort
of
people
myself
you
know
not
that
they
are
not
quite
as
good
as
i
am
but
and
then
one
acts
as
one
has
been
brought
up
i
never
supposed
it
was
a
wrong
thing
to
do
would
not
be
right
for
you
said
her
cousin
us
men
of
course
it
matter
but
you
i
should
not
like
to
see
you
at
the
red
house
with
a
mallet
in
your
hand
i
must
not
tell
you
my
motive
in
going
there
i
suppose
please
do
said
clare
with
queenly
superiority
but
a
heart
that
beat
very
quick
under
this
calm
appearance
think
i
can
divine
but
you
may
be
sure
of
my
interest
in
whatever
concerns
you
miss
pimpernel
is
very
pretty
she
has
the
loveliest
complexion
and
i
was
not
in
earnest
when
i
spoke
about
buttoning
her
should
not
you
be
in
earnest
she
does
nothing
but
button
her
glove
but
i
know
what
miss
pimpernel
has
to
do
with
it
said
arthur
putting
on
an
air
of
surprise
he
knew
very
well
what
she
had
to
do
with
it
he
understood
meaning
at
once
and
he
knew
also
that
there
was
a
certain
truth
in
the
suggestion
if
he
was
utterly
foiled
concerning
herself
he
was
by
no
means
sure
that
alice
pimpernel
was
not
the
next
best
but
he
put
on
an
air
of
surprise
and
gravely
waited
for
a
reply
clare
however
was
not
quite
able
to
reply
she
smiled
and
waited
till
he
should
say
more
it
was
the
wisest
and
the
safest
way
think
after
what
you
have
implied
i
must
tell
you
why
i
am
at
the
pimpernels
he
said
after
a
pause
was
very
silly
of
me
of
course
but
i
never
thought
in
short
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
consistent
i
thought
you
would
do
as
other
people
did
and
that
you
visited
them
like
the
rest
of
the
world
all
this
miss
arden
i
told
you
before
but
i
suppose
it
was
worth
remembering
when
your
brother
turned
me
out
arden
you
forget
yourself
edgar
never
turned
any
one
out
why
should
he
said
clare
and
then
she
stopped
and
said
to
herself
it
was
quite
course
i
could
not
expect
he
was
to
stay
here
for
me
but
he
did
turn
me
out
and
very
right
too
said
arthur
sadly
divined
me
better
than
you
did
had
i
been
edgar
and
he
me
i
should
have
done
just
the
do
not
understand
you
arden
said
clare
raising
her
lofty
head
is
the
very
soul
of
courtesy
and
kindness
you
do
not
understand
my
she
knew
so
well
that
she
was
talking
nonsense
and
he
knew
it
so
well
that
here
clare
paused
confused
not
able
to
go
on
with
her
fiction
under
his
very
eye
he
said
with
a
sigh
shaking
his
head
must
not
discuss
that
question
i
could
throw
light
upon
it
perhaps
but
for
the
present
i
dare
not
and
i
thought
in
my
stupidity
that
the
red
house
was
near
arden
i
find
it
is
a
thousand
miles
away
is
not
that
strange
miss
arden
i
am
going
to
do
something
genealogical
or
historical
i
think
i
will
write
a
book
writing
a
book
people
say
is
a
very
nice
amusement
when
you
know
what
to
do
with
yourself
and
if
you
happen
to
be
rather
wretched
now
and
then
i
am
going
to
write
something
about
the
family
i
wonder
if
edgar
and
you
would
let
me
see
the
old
family
papers
if
any
papers
exist
write
a
book
said
clare
miss
arden
had
rather
a
contempt
for
literature
but
to
write
a
book
which
was
not
for
money
like
the
books
of
professional
authors
but
about
family
like
so
many
handsome
books
she
had
seen
a
glorification
not
of
self
to
be
sure
but
of
ancestors
was
a
different
matter
a
slight
very
slight
came
upon
her
pale
face
it
was
not
the
kind
of
flush
which
appeared
when
arthur
arden
talked
of
other
subjects
it
was
a
thrill
of
pleasurable
excitement
a
movement
of
sudden
interest
and
pride
you
will
permit
me
to
see
what
papers
there
are
said
arthur
know
there
are
some
which
must
be
interesting
for
i
remember
your
father
he
was
peculiar
in
some
things
miss
arden
but
how
full
of
knowledge
and
power
he
was
was
not
he
cried
clare
with
sudden
tears
in
her
eyes
papa
poor
dear
papa
i
think
he
knew
everything
arden
it
is
so
kind
of
you
to
speak
of
him
no
one
ever
speaks
of
him
to
me
people
think
it
brings
grief
back
as
if
one
would
not
give
the
world
to
have
it
back
and
edgar
and
i
poor
edgar
he
talk
of
him
as
as
most
children
can
you
know
why
it
is
no
fault
perhaps
if
i
had
been
a
little
more
firm
but
oh
it
is
so
kind
of
you
to
talk
to
me
of
papa
did
not
mean
to
be
kind
said
arthur
arden
with
a
sudden
compunction
feeling
his
own
treachery
perhaps
i
knew
him
better
than
edgar
could
he
added
gently
he
loved
you
so
no
child
was
ever
more
to
a
father
but
i
should
not
say
anything
to
make
you
cry
like
to
cry
said
clare
have
not
cried
for
months
and
it
does
me
so
much
good
nobody
ever
loved
me
as
poor
papa
did
i
am
not
blaming
any
one
edgar
is
very
fond
of
me
mr
arden
he
is
very
fond
of
me
and
very
good
to
me
but
you
know
papa
was
like
no
one
else
said
the
traitor
and
good
heavens
he
asked
himself
am
i
putting
all
this
on
by
way
of
getting
possession
of
her
papers
what
a
horrible
villain
i
must
be
but
he
did
not
feel
himself
a
villain
he
went
on
talking
about
the
squire
with
the
profoundest
seriousness
and
feeling
what
he
said
though
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
motive
all
the
time
it
was
frightful
to
think
of
but
yet
thus
it
was
and
clare
who
had
so
much
emotion
pent
up
within
her
so
much
which
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
trace
to
its
just
source
and
which
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
persuaded
her
to
show
when
the
fountains
of
her
heart
were
thus
opened
and
a
feasible
occasion
given
her
whole
being
seemed
to
flow
forth
she
talked
of
her
father
and
felt
that
of
him
alone
could
she
thus
have
talked
and
her
tears
flowed
and
were
dried
and
flowed
again
not
all
for
her
father
a
great
deal
for
herself
for
the
complications
of
her
own
life
for
nameless
agitations
and
trouble
but
this
one
legitimate
reason
for
weeping
relieved
them
all
stupid
i
am
she
said
at
last
you
with
my
silly
crying
as
if
that
could
be
anything
to
you
arden
i
think
you
need
wait
for
leave
i
am
sure
he
would
let
me
give
it
i
know
whether
the
papers
are
interesting
but
there
is
that
old
bureau
in
the
library
it
was
bureau
he
always
used
it
as
long
as
he
lived
i
have
never
said
anything
about
it
and
i
have
never
had
the
heart
to
go
over
them
myself
but
there
are
quantities
of
letters
in
it
i
suppose
they
ought
to
be
burnt
if
you
find
anything
that
interests
you
i
might
go
over
papers
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
something
to
do
i
shall
be
at
hand
if
you
want
anything
said
arthur
was
it
possible
he
was
to
get
his
wish
so
easily
this
poor
little
lamb
did
not
even
wait
to
be
asked
she
thrust
her
head
into
the
mouth
the
papers
not
only
those
old
papers
which
he
had
pretended
to
want
but
any
windfall
of
modern
letters
that
might
fall
in
his
way
and
not
only
this
but
society
and
full
opportunity
to
work
upon
her
as
he
might
he
could
not
believe
it
was
true
as
he
went
away
it
was
his
first
visit
and
he
would
not
stay
too
long
nor
run
any
risk
he
left
her
as
it
were
on
the
verge
of
a
new
world
even
might
bring
forth
results
more
important
than
anything
that
had
yet
dawned
on
his
life
he
might
discover
something
which
would
put
arden
within
his
reach
or
chances
might
place
clare
within
his
reach
the
next
thing
to
arden
his
head
throbbed
with
excitement
and
his
heart
with
hope
as
for
clare
she
too
was
on
the
verge
of
a
new
world
but
it
was
one
of
excitement
and
emotion
only
her
dull
life
quickened
into
sudden
radiance
she
looked
out
again
from
the
window
and
saw
the
silvery
water
gleaming
and
the
branches
waving
and
all
the
face
of
nature
gay
the
day
had
brightened
the
world
grown
cheery
and
with
new
things
in
it
new
companionship
new
work
new
interests
smiled
and
invited
her
she
did
not
say
even
to
herself
shall
see
him
on
the
contrary
she
thought
of
her
father
and
his
papers
and
the
melancholy
pleasure
of
setting
them
in
order
it
would
be
of
course
a
melancholy
pleasure
and
yet
she
caught
herself
singing
as
she
ran
upstairs
to
get
her
hat
and
go
out
for
a
walk
could
it
be
this
prospect
only
which
made
her
heart
so
light
and
so
gay
chapter
xi
the
next
day
was
one
of
excitement
for
clare
she
began
it
with
feelings
so
changed
from
that
of
the
previous
morning
when
life
had
seemed
nothing
but
tedium
and
heaviness
to
her
that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
she
was
the
same
creature
the
calm
composure
of
her
earlier
days
when
no
new
incident
was
wanted
to
break
the
pleasant
blank
of
existence
was
as
different
from
this
new
exhiliration
as
it
was
from
the
heavy
leaden
dulness
of
the
time
which
was
just
over
she
had
wanted
nothing
in
the
first
serenity
of
her
youth
she
had
seemed
to
want
everything
in
the
monotony
of
her
loneliness
after
her
brother
and
her
cousin
had
left
her
and
now
again
she
wanted
nothing
except
except
she
did
not
say
to
herself
what
it
was
or
if
she
did
she
called
it
by
other
names
something
to
do
something
to
interest
her
a
little
society
in
the
midst
of
her
solitude
she
did
not
say
i
am
happy
because
he
is
coming
a
girl
must
have
gone
a
long
way
on
that
path
before
she
will
say
as
much
to
herself
but
a
sense
that
he
was
coming
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
the
sunshine
was
brighter
for
it
the
morning
was
sweeter
all
kinds
of
lovely
lights
and
gleams
of
life
and
movement
were
upon
the
park
the
very
scene
which
yesterday
had
been
so
unbearably
still
and
motionless
the
hours
did
not
seem
long
till
he
came
but
glided
past
with
the
softest
harmony
she
rather
felt
disposed
to
dwell
upon
them
to
lengthen
them
out
for
were
they
not
all
threaded
through
with
that
thread
of
expectation
which
made
their
stillness
rosy
it
fretted
her
a
little
to
have
this
enchanted
quiet
broken
by
murray
though
she
came
according
to
an
appointment
which
clare
had
forgotten
the
brow
clouded
over
with
impatience
when
this
visitor
was
announced
to
her
i
remember
she
said
sharply
to
wilkins
her
come
upstairs
i
told
her
to
but
it
was
a
little
relief
to
mind
to
find
that
her
visitor
was
alone
which
supplied
her
at
once
with
a
legitimate
cause
of
offence
have
not
brought
jeanie
with
you
she
said
she
ill
or
what
is
the
matter
i
so
particularly
wished
her
to
come
had
a
reason
for
no
bringing
her
and
in
case
it
should
be
made
known
to
you
after
and
look
like
a
falseness
i
have
come
to
tell
you
miss
arden
said
murray
house
no
doubt
is
full
of
pictures
of
your
father
it
is
but
right
i
saw
one
down
the
stair
as
i
came
in
at
the
door
what
then
what
has
picture
to
do
with
it
asked
clare
in
amaze
would
think
little
enough
miss
arden
said
murray
is
just
what
i
have
to
tell
you
mind
that
my
cousin
thomas
perfitt
has
been
long
in
the
service
of
your
house
and
jeanie
has
seen
your
father
and
it
made
her
heart
sore
my
father
said
clare
with
wonder
which
was
not
so
great
as
her
visitor
expected
did
not
know
you
had
been
here
were
never
here
before
where
we
saw
your
father
was
at
loch
arroch
in
our
own
place
i
knew
him
before
you
were
born
miss
arden
when
i
was
no
to
say
young
but
younger
than
i
am
now
and
your
mother
poor
lady
too
this
she
said
sinking
her
voice
so
that
clare
with
difficulty
made
it
out
mother
too
she
cried
strange
how
very
strange
you
should
never
have
told
me
this
before
canna
think
you
will
say
strange
if
ye
consider
said
the
scotchwoman
folk
here
must
have
seen
your
mother
no
as
if
you
were
ignorant
and
no
as
if
i
had
anything
to
say
but
as
been
led
to
say
it
to
others
i
wouldna
have
you
think
there
was
a
falseness
she
was
young
and
she
was
feeble
poor
thing
when
i
saw
her
more
than
five
and
twenty
years
ago
when
him
now
arden
had
but
lately
come
into
this
weary
speak
in
such
a
strange
way
said
clare
now
arden
do
you
mean
my
brother
edgar
he
is
just
was
but
an
infant
and
well
i
mind
it
said
the
old
woman
shaking
her
head
with
mournful
meaning
was
a
sore
time
to
me
death
and
trouble
was
in
my
house
and
oh
the
trouble
and
the
deaths
i
have
had
miss
arden
to
hear
of
them
would
frighten
the
like
of
you
but
first
i
must
tell
you
why
i
canna
bring
jeanie
here
two
years
ago
or
may
be
more
two
months
more
for
it
was
in
the
month
of
april
your
father
came
to
see
me
him
and
me
i
told
you
had
met
before
there
were
things
i
kent
that
were
of
consequence
to
him
and
things
he
kent
that
were
of
consequence
to
me
jeanie
and
her
brother
willie
a
bonnie
blythe
laddie
were
both
about
the
house
willie
was
a
sailor
sore
against
my
will
and
oh
miss
arden
so
bonnie
a
boy
your
father
was
real
kind
been
hard
hard
to
bear
but
he
meant
to
be
kind
he
got
my
willie
a
ship
out
of
liverpool
the
poor
laddie
went
away
from
us
two
years
this
june
as
blythe
as
ony
bridegroom
and
miss
arden
never
come
back
come
back
wonder
was
so
great
that
she
repeated
the
last
words
without
any
real
sense
of
their
meaning
as
she
would
have
repeated
anything
that
made
a
pause
in
this
strange
narrative
her
father
she
seemed
to
herself
to
possess
his
later
life
to
know
its
every
detail
to
hold
it
as
it
were
in
her
hands
he
had
never
done
anything
without
telling
her
without
consulting
her
she
would
have
said
yet
here
was
a
secret
of
which
she
knew
nothing
she
was
not
selfish
but
her
mind
was
not
so
readily
open
to
the
affairs
of
others
as
was
that
of
her
brother
she
never
thought
of
the
young
sailor
or
of
the
old
mother
who
spoke
so
sadly
she
thought
only
of
her
father
and
his
secret
what
were
the
others
to
her
of
course
she
would
have
been
sorry
for
them
had
their
sorrows
been
sufficiently
impressed
on
her
imagination
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
her
father
she
was
thinking
of
with
bewildering
wonder
and
pain
murray
on
the
other
hand
was
absorbed
with
her
own
part
of
the
tale
never
came
back
she
repeated
with
a
thrill
of
agitation
in
her
voice
was
lost
in
the
wild
sea
far
out
of
our
reach
oh
it
might
have
happened
the
same
it
might
have
come
to
the
innocentest
woman
as
it
came
to
me
many
a
lad
is
lost
and
many
a
family
brought
to
mourning
and
naebody
to
blame
but
when
i
think
of
all
been
in
my
life
and
that
the
like
of
that
should
come
by
means
the
one
man
that
is
how
jeanie
knew
your
father
miss
arden
she
took
your
cousin
for
him
and
it
made
her
wild
i
daurna
bring
her
here
to
pain
her
with
his
picture
she
was
aye
a
strange
bairn
all
her
life
and
loss
made
her
all
wrong
what
i
came
to
tell
you
to
be
honest
and
clear
reproach
no
good
or
without
guilt
that
i
should
say
so
but
oh
i
hate
a
lie
clare
scarcely
heeded
this
exclamation
she
did
not
realise
it
nor
occupy
herself
about
what
her
visitor
felt
there
was
so
much
in
this
revelation
that
concerned
herself
that
she
had
no
leisure
for
other
feelings
do
not
see
how
you
could
blame
papa
she
said
almost
coldly
course
he
did
it
for
the
best
how
was
he
to
know
the
ship
would
be
lost
i
am
sorry
but
i
think
it
very
strange
that
you
should
suppose
it
was
his
fault
jeanie
ought
to
be
told
how
foolish
it
is
papa
would
not
have
hurt
any
one
he
would
not
have
been
cruel
to
a
here
clare
paused
with
a
good
deal
of
natural
indignant
feeling
was
the
woman
trying
to
make
some
claim
upon
her
to
establish
a
grievance
it
was
a
kind
thing
her
father
had
done
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
interest
himself
about
it
without
even
telling
his
daughter
and
then
they
were
discontented
because
the
ship
was
lost
how
unreasonable
how
preposterous
it
seemed
must
be
said
about
my
father
which
i
ought
not
to
hear
she
said
after
a
pause
words
can
say
how
fond
i
was
of
papa
he
was
everything
to
me
he
was
so
good
to
me
he
never
had
any
secrets
from
me
no
i
am
sure
he
had
not
he
did
not
speak
of
you
because
perhaps
for
he
was
not
one
to
blazon
his
own
kindness
or
and
then
he
might
forget
why
should
he
speak
to
me
of
you
think
we
are
humble
folk
no
worthy
to
be
thought
upon
said
murray
with
a
half
smile
it
was
not
sneering
but
pitying
very
grave
and
very
sad
true
true
what
was
a
life
more
or
less
in
a
poor
farmhouse
so
long
as
the
grand
race
ran
on
you
are
very
like
your
father
miss
arden
that
was
the
very
way
his
thoughts
ran
thoughts
were
always
kind
and
good
said
clare
hastily
and
it
was
hard
very
hard
for
her
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
to
resist
a
girlish
inclination
to
burst
into
tears
it
was
so
ungrateful
she
would
have
said
so
cruel
and
unkind
what
because
a
kind
service
was
done
which
brought
on
painful
results
was
it
the
benefactor
that
was
to
be
blamed
jeanie
were
to
be
ill
now
you
might
just
as
well
say
it
was
my
doing
she
added
in
her
suppressed
passion
and
felt
that
she
disliked
the
very
looks
of
this
stranger
and
her
monotonous
scotch
voice
then
there
was
a
long
pause
clare
turned
over
all
the
books
on
the
table
before
her
took
up
and
put
down
her
work
twisted
the
wools
about
her
fingers
till
her
anger
had
somewhat
evaporated
murray
sat
at
a
little
distance
from
her
saying
nothing
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
portrait
of
clare
taken
a
year
or
two
before
which
hung
on
the
wall
she
looked
at
it
with
a
wondering
interest
growing
more
and
more
earnest
in
her
attention
are
like
too
she
said
at
length
with
a
certain
astonishment
the
portrait
was
not
like
clare
at
that
moment
it
was
clare
in
repose
when
gentler
thoughts
were
in
her
mind
are
like
too
murray
resumed
with
a
little
eagerness
could
not
have
thought
it
but
no
one
to
let
your
heart
be
broken
without
a
word
the
lord
be
do
you
mean
if
it
is
of
mamma
you
are
speaking
it
is
my
brother
who
is
like
her
said
clare
haughtily
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
not
meddle
any
further
with
our
if
i
could
but
let
them
alone
and
never
think
of
them
more
the
scotchwoman
rose
as
she
said
this
with
a
deep
and
prolonged
sigh
without
another
word
she
went
to
the
door
will
come
to
you
if
you
send
for
me
miss
arden
if
ever
wanted
in
this
house
she
said
no
for
any
other
reason
i
would
forget
if
i
could
that
there
ever
was
man
or
woman
bearing
your
name
but
the
past
can
not
be
forgotten
and
come
if
i
am
ever
wanted
with
these
words
she
went
away
something
solemn
was
in
them
something
which
was
incomprehensible
which
sounded
real
and
yet
must
be
absolute
folly
clare
thought
why
should
be
wanted
at
arden
what
could
she
ever
do
to
affect
the
house
no
doubt
there
were
people
still
living
in
the
world
who
believed
in
revenge
and
would
hunt
down
if
they
could
a
man
who
had
injured
them
but
what
revenge
could
this
woman
carry
out
upon
the
ardens
it
was
a
piece
of
folly
a
mere
dream
clare
laughed
at
the
thought
that
murray
could
be
wanted
that
she
could
be
sent
for
to
arden
but
her
laugh
sounded
harsh
to
herself
she
resented
the
whole
matter
the
visit
the
uncalled
for
narrative
the
almost
threat
the
interruption
of
her
pleasant
thoughts
and
then
the
question
would
come
back
what
had
been
the
tie
between
her
parents
and
this
woman
she
remembered
so
clearly
her
absence
from
home
two
years
ago
he
had
told
her
he
had
business
in
london
and
he
had
gone
to
scotland
instead
how
very
strange
it
was
the
more
clare
thought
of
it
the
more
angry
she
grew
if
he
had
secrets
if
he
did
things
she
was
not
to
know
what
right
had
any
one
to
come
and
tell
her
now
when
he
could
no
longer
explain
the
matter
and
all
his
secrets
were
buried
with
him
she
had
her
hand
on
the
bell
to
send
for
perfitt
and
question
him
what
sort
of
woman
this
was
whom
he
had
brought
to
arden
to
perplex
and
vex
everybody
and
then
she
remembered
sally
gossip
and
tried
to
think
evil
thoughts
to
some
people
it
comes
natural
to
think
ill
of
their
neighbours
but
clare
was
too
spotless
and
too
proud
for
such
a
tendency
she
did
not
believe
any
harm
of
murray
and
yet
she
tried
to
believe
it
and
then
she
tried
to
laugh
once
more
and
dismiss
the
whole
matter
from
her
mind
and
then
it
was
the
clock
striking
two
which
roused
her
and
the
entrance
of
wilkins
with
the
little
luncheon
tray
which
furnished
her
doleful
solitary
little
meal
this
roused
her
out
of
her
resentment
and
her
dreams
not
that
she
was
tempted
by
the
wing
or
even
the
strawberries
among
their
cool
green
leaves
but
that
the
morning
was
over
and
the
second
chapter
of
the
day
as
it
were
about
to
commence
and
that
second
chapter
had
the
hero
in
it
and
all
the
nameless
sweet
agitations
that
would
come
with
him
the
fancies
and
visions
and
expectations
which
distinguish
one
phase
of
life
and
make
it
more
enthralling
than
any
other
after
a
while
that
other
step
would
disturb
the
silence
and
all
the
world
would
brighten
up
and
widen
she
could
not
tell
why
not
because
of
arthur
arden
surely
he
was
no
prince
of
romance
she
said
to
herself
she
entertained
she
assured
herself
no
delusions
about
him
he
was
very
agreeable
to
her
a
man
who
pleased
her
a
true
arden
but
she
did
not
pretend
to
think
him
a
king
of
men
therefore
it
could
not
be
her
cousin
whose
coming
was
to
change
everything
it
must
be
the
pleasant
work
she
was
about
to
begin
with
him
the
common
family
interest
the
intercourse
with
one
who
almost
belonged
to
her
who
was
always
ready
to
talk
and
willing
to
discuss
anything
that
caught
her
interest
very
different
from
being
alone
and
worrying
over
everything
as
people
do
who
have
no
one
to
confide
their
troubles
to
she
would
tell
her
cousin
about
murray
and
thus
get
rid
of
the
thought
this
was
what
lightened
the
cloud
from
about
her
and
brought
back
the
atmosphere
to
its
original
clearness
it
was
so
pleasant
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
one
of
the
family
to
whom
she
could
venture
to
say
anything
of
course
this
was
all
and
it
was
enough
for
clare
chapter
xii
arthur
arden
was
punctual
to
his
appointment
he
had
thought
of
little
else
since
he
left
arden
the
day
before
to
do
him
justice
society
the
power
of
approaching
her
as
he
would
was
very
sweet
to
him
especially
after
a
severe
course
of
croquet
at
the
red
house
and
a
few
days
with
the
pimpernels
in
short
he
was
able
to
disguise
to
himself
his
other
motive
altogether
and
to
forget
he
had
any
clandestine
object
am
going
to
look
over
some
old
family
papers
with
my
cousin
he
had
said
to
pimpernel
who
for
her
part
had
not
much
liked
the
information
he
is
going
to
make
a
of
us
and
spend
all
his
time
running
after
that
proud
thing
she
said
to
her
husband
alice
is
worth
two
of
her
any
day
and
i
hold
with
your
family
got
any
have
we
said
pimpernel
you
wait
a
bit
mary
i
know
what
the
family
papers
hope
you
do
pimpernel
said
his
wife
with
evident
scepticism
and
she
did
not
like
it
when
arthur
arden
instead
of
joining
alice
at
her
croquet
or
attending
herself
upon
her
drive
went
off
again
after
luncheon
to
visit
his
cousin
that
is
the
way
of
it
i
see
the
good
of
having
a
gentleman
in
the
house
she
said
to
alice
then
there
is
denbigh
mamma
said
alice
innocently
for
which
her
mother
could
have
boxed
her
ears
and
arthur
turned
his
back
upon
them
and
their
croquet
ground
with
the
intensest
satisfaction
it
was
very
heavy
work
he
had
been
in
a
great
many
country
houses
and
he
had
occasionally
felt
that
in
his
position
as
a
man
without
any
particular
means
or
advantages
a
good
deal
of
exertion
had
been
required
from
him
in
payment
for
the
hospitality
he
received
he
had
seen
the
justice
of
it
and
in
a
general
way
he
had
not
made
much
objection
but
then
these
were
houses
full
of
people
where
if
a
man
made
himself
generally
useful
every
necessity
of
the
circumstances
was
satisfied
and
he
was
not
compelled
to
devote
himself
specially
to
stupid
or
wearisome
individuals
he
had
the
sweet
along
with
the
bitter
and
he
had
not
complained
but
to
be
told
off
for
personal
service
or
for
croquet
was
a
different
matter
and
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
with
a
light
heart
and
when
the
door
of
the
old
hereditary
house
opened
to
him
and
clare
like
one
of
the
pictures
from
the
walls
rose
with
a
little
tremulous
expectation
holding
out
her
hand
the
difference
was
such
that
it
confused
his
mind
altogether
and
made
him
conscious
of
nothing
but
intense
relief
look
over
family
papers
oh
yes
or
mow
the
lawn
if
she
liked
or
work
in
the
garden
he
said
to
himself
that
the
one
pretext
would
be
just
as
good
as
the
other
it
was
a
pretext
not
any
intended
treachery
but
only
a
means
of
being
near
clare
you
like
to
go
to
the
library
at
once
she
said
have
just
glanced
at
the
papers
poor
papa
arranged
on
the
top
shelves
of
his
bureau
all
his
own
letters
and
things
are
below
shall
we
go
to
the
library
at
once
am
not
in
a
hurry
said
arthur
you
mind
let
me
wait
a
little
and
breathe
arden
it
is
so
sweet
after
the
atmosphere
i
have
been
in
i
am
not
ungrateful
pray
think
so
it
was
extremely
kind
of
the
pimpernels
to
give
me
shelter
in
my
forlorn
condition
see
why
you
should
ever
be
in
a
forlorn
condition
said
clare
suppose
i
mean
to
be
rude
but
i
bear
to
think
of
an
arden
receiving
hospitality
from
people
like
the
dear
cousin
said
arthur
arden
when
he
is
not
actually
of
the
reigning
family
must
do
what
he
can
in
this
world
the
sanctity
of
the
race
is
not
perhaps
acknowledged
as
it
ought
to
be
and
i
am
too
much
obliged
to
anybody
who
gives
me
shelter
in
this
neighbourhood
one
ought
to
be
in
town
i
suppose
but
then
i
am
sick
of
town
and
there
is
nobody
to
go
to
yet
in
the
country
therefore
i
say
long
live
the
pimpernels
but
all
the
same
one
breathes
freer
is
not
much
to
amuse
any
one
here
said
clare
i
know
how
it
will
be
you
will
make
me
speak
as
i
ought
not
to
speak
and
then
you
will
drive
me
away
and
i
can
not
bear
being
driven
away
there
is
a
little
pucker
in
the
brow
of
the
lady
clare
may
i
know
why
are
like
edgar
he
always
worries
me
about
that
line
in
my
forehead
said
clare
if
i
could
help
it
yes
i
have
been
a
little
annoyed
i
think
i
may
as
well
tell
you
and
perhaps
you
can
give
me
some
advice
it
is
that
murray
that
scotchwoman
she
has
just
been
here
to
tell
me
that
she
knew
papa
and
that
he
went
to
see
her
in
scotland
two
years
ago
it
is
very
strange
and
very
uncomfortable
he
used
to
tell
me
everything
or
at
least
so
i
ever
does
tell
everything
said
arthur
like
an
oracle
clare
paused
and
gazed
wistfully
into
his
face
what
they
are
thinking
nor
what
they
feel
but
surely
what
they
do
how
can
you
conceal
what
you
do
some
one
must
be
taken
into
your
confidence
common
people
must
see
you
in
whom
you
have
no
confidence
while
your
very
own
here
clare
stopped
abruptly
feeling
that
tears
were
about
to
come
into
her
voice
know
what
you
say
said
arthur
who
was
secretly
touched
one
thinks
and
feels
is
often
the
best
of
one
but
what
we
do
was
there
ever
a
man
who
could
venture
to
show
a
woman
everything
in
his
life
a
woman
like
you
papa
said
clare
boldly
am
sure
he
told
me
everything
except
oh
is
it
not
dreadful
is
it
not
horrible
to
have
this
wretched
woman
coming
when
he
is
no
longer
here
to
explain
it
all
to
make
me
lose
my
confidence
in
papa
and
then
you
too
too
he
said
and
he
ventured
to
take
her
hand
am
not
worthy
of
your
interest
at
all
and
dare
not
lay
my
poor
worthless
life
open
before
you
but
listen
i
will
recant
one
could
not
show
you
the
past
in
which
one
was
wandering
without
any
compass
but
clare
i
am
your
cousin
i
may
call
you
clare
sometimes
if
one
could
be
so
bold
as
to
believe
that
you
took
any
interest
i
mean
edgar
for
instance
who
can
be
sure
you
take
an
interest
i
do
believe
that
such
a
lucky
man
as
he
is
might
tell
you
everything
yes
no
doubt
your
father
did
but
not
the
past
not
all
the
past
clare
drew
a
little
aside
afraid
she
could
not
tell
why
she
had
withdrawn
her
hand
from
him
at
once
she
had
given
him
only
a
little
bow
of
assent
when
he
called
her
by
her
name
she
had
not
him
of
that
she
was
certain
it
is
best
not
to
discuss
it
she
said
i
can
not
tell
you
how
that
woman
vexed
me
to
come
and
say
she
knew
things
of
my
own
father
which
i
did
not
know
fancy
papa
perhaps
it
is
my
pride
i
should
not
wonder
but
i
could
not
bear
it
and
now
you
know
if
i
look
into
his
letters
i
may
find
things
do
you
think
it
is
likely
he
was
an
old
man
he
was
sixty
when
he
died
he
had
been
forty
years
in
the
world
before
he
had
any
one
i
mean
before
he
had
to
confide
in
should
i
read
them
should
i
look
at
them
i
know
what
to
you
could
trust
me
said
arthur
arden
the
thought
flushed
him
with
sudden
excitement
this
would
indeed
be
delivering
the
very
stronghold
into
his
hands
and
then
all
the
remnants
of
honourable
feeling
that
was
left
there
stirred
together
in
his
mind
he
blushed
for
the
baseness
he
had
almost
meditated
you
could
trust
me
to
look
over
them
he
resumed
with
an
earnestness
which
surprised
himself
may
be
quite
sure
that
any
and
every
secret
i
mean
i
am
nearest
to
you
after
edgar
it
would
be
safe
with
and
then
with
the
speed
of
lightning
a
calculation
ran
through
his
mind
yes
he
would
be
faithful
to
his
word
the
secret
should
be
safe
with
him
safe
as
in
the
grave
if
even
he
should
find
proof
of
facts
which
would
be
damning
to
edgar
he
would
consider
himself
bound
to
take
no
personal
action
upon
it
if
he
discovered
it
in
such
a
way
he
would
let
edgar
know
and
clare
who
were
the
persons
most
concerned
and
then
he
would
himself
withdraw
and
never
more
mention
the
subject
he
would
leave
the
knowledge
of
it
to
work
in
their
minds
he
himself
would
win
only
the
reward
of
honour
and
virtue
to
such
a
course
of
procedure
the
strictest
moralist
could
have
no
objection
for
if
anything
were
found
out
though
it
would
be
treachery
to
employ
it
for
his
own
interest
it
could
only
be
duty
to
reveal
it
to
edgar
and
clare
he
looked
at
his
cousin
with
a
certain
anxiety
feeling
that
his
fate
lay
in
her
hands
it
lay
in
her
hands
in
a
great
many
ways
she
was
but
a
child
in
comparison
with
his
years
a
baby
in
experience
an
unreasoning
impulsive
girl
and
yet
she
held
all
his
future
in
her
little
fingers
its
higher
or
lower
position
even
its
honour
or
dishonour
its
virtue
or
a
tremendous
power
to
lie
in
such
unconscious
hands
said
clare
with
a
certain
haughtiness
and
then
in
a
moment
arthur
felt
that
this
at
least
was
not
to
be
one
but
myself
must
do
it
she
went
on
firmly
even
edgar
who
did
not
love
at
least
it
was
not
possible
he
could
love
much
they
were
so
separated
no
if
there
is
any
pain
in
it
i
must
bear
it
as
best
i
can
no
one
must
do
it
but
he
made
a
bow
of
assent
to
her
decision
it
was
not
for
him
to
say
a
word
and
even
in
his
momentary
disappointment
there
was
a
certain
relief
after
all
even
had
he
adopted
that
path
of
strict
virtue
there
would
have
been
something
doubtful
about
the
proceeding
whereas
if
he
found
anything
by
chance
and
then
he
could
not
but
speculate
what
clare
would
do
if
she
made
any
such
discovery
as
he
hoped
what
would
she
do
would
she
in
her
innocence
understand
what
it
meant
or
if
it
should
be
too
clear
for
mistake
would
her
love
for
him
who
would
still
be
her
brother
for
her
dead
son
be
stronger
than
abstract
justice
probably
she
would
not
understand
it
all
he
thought
and
so
this
fine
opportunity
this
wonderful
chance
would
be
thrown
away
he
heard
her
renewed
invitation
to
him
to
go
to
the
library
like
a
man
in
a
dream
the
issues
might
be
mighty
but
it
was
such
a
chance
all
depending
upon
how
far
an
innocent
girl
could
understand
a
record
of
wickedness
or
an
injured
man
have
proofs
of
his
own
dishonour
chances
are
he
destroyed
everything
he
said
to
himself
but
half
aloud
as
he
followed
clare
did
you
say
was
not
aware
i
said
anything
the
thought
that
passed
through
my
mind
was
that
probably
your
father
if
he
had
any
painful
secrets
in
his
life
was
so
wise
as
to
destroy
all
trace
of
them
nay
mistake
me
i
say
probably
he
had
no
secrets
at
all
or
only
innocent
ones
but
think
he
destroyed
anything
said
clare
almost
sharply
as
she
led
the
way
now
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
it
she
did
not
wish
to
be
balked
of
her
mystery
it
was
very
dreadful
and
painful
and
a
great
shock
but
still
if
there
was
anything
in
it
she
went
on
first
into
the
large
lofty
sombre
room
which
was
the
arden
library
it
was
everything
that
a
library
ought
to
be
the
books
were
but
little
used
it
is
true
but
then
the
room
was
so
noiseless
so
cool
and
grey
and
secluded
that
it
seemed
the
very
place
for
a
student
to
be
sure
the
ardens
had
never
been
great
students
but
they
had
all
the
books
that
ought
to
be
in
a
library
an
excellent
collection
of
english
literature
a
fair
show
of
classics
and
many
books
in
other
living
languages
these
books
were
very
seldom
disturbed
behind
their
wires
but
the
silence
was
supreme
and
would
have
lent
itself
to
the
deepest
study
edgar
had
been
daunted
by
the
solemn
dignity
of
the
place
he
had
felt
that
his
discussions
with
perfitt
and
all
the
business
he
had
to
transact
were
out
of
place
in
this
stately
solemn
room
and
with
his
usual
indifference
to
the
traditions
of
the
ardens
had
removed
himself
into
a
homely
bright
little
place
full
of
impertinent
windows
and
modern
papered
walls
where
he
had
hung
up
a
great
many
of
his
possessions
and
where
perfitt
could
talk
above
his
breath
after
this
change
a
deepened
and
still
deepening
solemnity
had
fallen
upon
the
library
it
had
been
the
old
room
where
he
had
spent
all
his
mornings
the
quaint
bureau
which
stood
in
one
corner
was
full
of
his
papers
he
had
locked
it
up
himself
the
last
day
he
was
downstairs
and
nobody
had
opened
it
since
so
completely
was
the
room
identified
with
him
that
the
maids
in
the
house
began
to
rush
past
the
door
when
twilight
was
coming
on
and
would
not
enter
it
after
dark
know
see
man
in
his
chair
as
he
used
to
the
housemaid
had
said
to
the
housekeeper
and
the
library
was
clearly
in
a
fair
way
for
being
haunted
it
was
with
a
certain
solemnity
now
that
clare
opened
the
door
she
had
scarcely
been
in
it
since
her
death
and
though
she
would
have
repudiated
all
superstitious
feeling
no
doubt
there
was
a
certain
thrill
of
awe
in
her
mind
when
she
entered
her
private
room
with
the
intention
of
investigating
into
his
secrets
what
if
some
spiritual
presence
might
guard
these
relics
of
the
ended
life
what
if
something
impalpable
undiscernible
should
float
between
her
and
its
records
clare
hung
back
a
little
and
paused
on
the
threshold
she
could
almost
fancy
she
saw
him
seated
at
the
not
yet
feeble
not
asking
even
her
sympathy
dearly
though
he
loved
her
she
had
known
everything
he
did
or
planned
and
yet
now
she
thought
of
it
how
little
had
she
known
of
him
nothing
except
the
present
his
old
age
with
all
its
hushed
excitements
and
interests
past
it
was
now
that
she
thought
of
it
a
veiled
being
who
had
sat
there
for
so
many
years
in
her
sight
except
that
he
loved
herself
that
he
dined
and
rode
with
her
and
sat
for
hours
in
this
library
and
allowed
the
cottages
to
be
rebuilt
and
a
great
deal
of
charity
to
be
given
what
did
she
know
of
her
father
that
and
that
he
hated
edgar
nothing
more
her
heart
gave
a
jump
to
her
mouth
as
she
entered
the
room
in
which
the
silence
seemed
to
brood
and
deepen
knowing
a
great
deal
more
than
she
did
clare
owned
this
strange
influence
and
it
subdued
her
for
the
moment
but
the
next
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
shook
off
the
momentary
impression
not
now
on
the
threshold
of
the
mystery
was
it
possible
to
withdraw
or
fail
chapter
xiii
two
or
three
days
elapsed
after
this
commencement
of
operations
and
the
pimpernels
had
begun
to
be
seriously
affronted
day
by
day
arden
deserted
them
after
luncheon
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
apologise
now
and
then
it
happened
that
the
croquet
came
absolutely
to
a
and
once
pimpernel
drove
into
liverpool
without
any
captive
knight
to
exhibit
which
was
very
hard
upon
her
she
was
a
hospitable
woman
ready
to
invite
any
individual
of
the
fashionable
houseless
and
homeless
class
but
then
on
the
other
hand
she
expected
something
in
return
respect
she
called
it
but
it
meant
a
good
deal
of
social
work
attendance
upon
her
daughter
and
herself
a
sort
of
combination
of
the
amateur
footman
and
the
amusing
companion
at
this
rate
she
would
have
given
arthur
arden
board
and
lodging
for
as
long
a
period
as
he
might
desire
so
long
as
she
could
have
it
in
her
power
to
explain
to
any
of
her
friends
whom
she
met
that
he
was
of
the
ardens
of
arden
indeed
the
next
heir
to
the
property
she
was
able
to
feel
that
she
had
something
for
her
money
but
to
give
him
the
green
room
which
was
one
of
the
nicest
in
the
house
and
to
feed
him
with
truffles
and
champagne
and
all
the
delicacies
of
the
season
in
order
that
he
might
spend
half
the
day
the
really
useful
part
of
the
day
with
his
cousin
was
a
thing
she
had
not
bargained
for
she
showed
her
displeasure
to
the
culprit
himself
in
a
manner
which
would
have
been
much
more
plain
to
him
had
he
cared
more
about
it
and
she
complained
to
her
husband
stating
her
grievance
in
the
plainest
terms
arthur
arden
is
an
utter
nuisance
she
said
consider
it
most
impudent
of
him
pimpernel
he
comes
and
stays
here
making
a
convenience
of
our
house
but
never
thinks
of
paying
proper
respect
such
as
any
man
who
was
a
gentleman
would
he
sees
alice
and
me
drive
out
by
ourselves
and
actually
has
the
assurance
to
wave
his
hand
to
us
and
wish
us
a
pleasant
drive
yesterday
i
said
to
him
i
really
could
not
help
it
do
much
to
make
our
drive
pleasant
arden
and
he
simply
stared
at
me
fancy
having
to
drive
into
liverpool
shopping
alice
and
i
without
a
soul
when
everybody
knows
i
like
to
have
a
gentleman
to
do
little
things
for
us
and
arden
actually
staying
in
the
house
was
cool
of
him
said
her
husband
is
what
i
call
a
cool
hand
is
arden
speak
to
him
if
you
like
i
am
not
one
of
the
men
that
beat
about
the
bush
make
yourself
understood
my
motto
there
is
just
one
thing
to
be
said
for
him
however
and
that
is
that
it
may
be
business
he
told
me
he
was
hunting
through
the
arden
papers
confounded
silly
of
that
girl
to
let
him
but
that
is
no
business
of
business
indeed
said
pimpernel
that
takes
him
to
clare
side
every
afternoon
i
much
believe
in
that
kind
of
business
what
he
can
see
in
her
i
am
sure
i
can
not
divine
a
thing
looking
down
upon
them
that
are
as
good
as
she
is
any
day
just
fancy
a
man
leaving
our
alice
hitting
the
balls
about
all
day
by
herself
poor
child
on
the
lawn
a
man
staying
in
the
house
and
going
off
to
the
hall
to
clare
arden
do
you
call
that
proper
respect
as
for
good
taste
i
speak
of
that
for
it
is
clear
he
has
not
got
any
and
you
take
my
word
for
it
business
is
nothing
but
a
am
not
so
sure
of
that
said
mr
pimpernel
see
if
he
really
is
doing
anything
his
policy
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
that
girl
she
gives
him
access
to
the
papers
you
know
the
papers
are
the
great
thing
you
be
too
exacting
for
a
day
or
two
if
alice
mopes
let
me
know
by
jove
i
have
my
little
girl
crossed
odd
if
i
buy
her
anything
she
takes
a
fancy
to
but
all
the
same
an
old
fellow
is
arden
and
he
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
i
see
much
reason
why
she
should
set
her
heart
on
my
word
and
honour
pimpernel
said
the
lady
that
is
all
the
opinion
you
have
of
your
own
child
set
her
heart
on
arthur
arden
indeed
she
would
never
have
looked
at
him
if
it
been
for
that
talk
about
the
property
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
mistake
about
the
property
do
you
think
ever
i
hope
i
have
more
opinion
of
my
girl
than
that
but
when
i
ask
a
man
to
my
house
i
own
i
look
for
proper
respect
i
consider
his
business
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
me
and
not
to
strangers
my
house
an
inn
to
be
at
the
convenience
of
visitors
to
arden
if
he
likes
best
being
there
let
him
go
and
live
there
i
say
arden
is
arden
and
the
red
house
is
the
red
house
and
the
one
depend
upon
the
other
nor
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
other
if
one
thing
i
hate
it
is
pride
and
mean
ways
let
her
take
him
in
and
keep
him
if
she
wants
him
but
i
keep
him
and
feed
him
with
the
best
of
everything
and
champagne
like
water
for
miss
clare
sake
or
miss
anything
that
ever
was
born
pimpernel
was
tying
on
her
nightcap
as
she
spoke
and
the
act
deafened
her
a
little
for
the
nightcap
strings
were
stiff
and
well
starched
which
was
perhaps
the
reason
why
she
delivered
the
concluding
words
in
so
loud
a
voice
pimpernel
was
a
courageous
man
enough
but
when
it
came
to
this
he
was
too
prudent
to
do
anything
to
increase
the
storm
speak
to
him
if
you
like
he
said
always
best
to
know
exactly
what
one
is
about
put
it
in
the
plainest
terms
but
i
think
we
might
wait
a
day
or
two
all
the
same
a
fine
property
and
arthur
arden
is
a
clever
fellow
he
knows
what
as
well
as
any
man
i
know
and
if
making
a
of
his
cousin
you
blame
him
if
i
were
you
give
him
a
day
or
am
sick
of
him
and
everything
about
him
he
is
no
more
use
than
that
poker
said
pimpernel
seating
herself
in
disgust
in
a
chair
which
stood
in
her
habitual
corner
at
the
side
of
the
vacant
fireplace
the
poker
in
question
gleamed
in
brilliant
steel
incongruity
from
amid
the
papery
convolutions
of
an
ornamental
structure
which
filled
the
grate
nothing
could
well
be
more
useless
it
was
a
simile
which
went
to
her
heart
think
that
i
was
poking
the
fire
with
that
identical
poker
not
six
weeks
ago
he
said
now
the
enough
to
kill
you
if
you
had
felt
it
in
the
office
at
three
i
can
tell
you
it
was
no
you
think
i
feel
it
said
his
wife
into
liverpool
under
that
broiling
sun
without
a
soul
to
amuse
you
or
offer
you
his
arm
or
anything
and
arden
quite
comfortable
enjoying
himself
in
the
big
cool
rooms
at
the
hall
ah
fathers
little
know
what
one
has
to
go
through
for
children
all
this
blessed
afternoon
was
i
choosing
sleeves
and
collars
and
things
for
alice
and
summer
frocks
for
the
children
the
way
they
grow
and
the
number
of
changes
they
want
and
we
had
to
allow
more
for
collars
she
is
certainly
getting
stout
i
am
stout
myself
and
of
course
at
my
age
it
matter
but
the
more
that
child
takes
exercise
the
more
she
fills
out
i
understand
it
you
might
have
drawn
me
through
a
ring
when
i
was
her
must
have
been
a
very
ring
said
pimpernel
i
like
your
maypoles
of
girls
i
like
nice
and
round
and
fat
heavens
pimpernel
you
speak
as
if
you
were
going
to
eat
them
said
his
wife
they
were
all
as
nice
healthy
plump
red
and
white
as
my
alice
said
the
indulgent
father
and
then
there
followed
a
few
parental
comments
on
both
sides
on
the
comparative
growths
of
jane
eliza
and
thus
the
conversation
dropped
and
the
danger
which
threatened
arthur
arden
was
for
the
moment
over
but
yet
he
felt
next
morning
that
something
explosive
was
in
the
air
it
was
his
interest
to
stay
at
the
red
house
as
long
as
possible
to
have
his
invitation
renewed
if
that
was
possible
and
he
felt
instinctively
that
something
must
be
done
to
mend
matters
it
was
a
great
bore
for
though
he
had
discovered
nothing
as
yet
he
had
been
living
in
the
closest
intercourse
with
clare
and
had
been
making
he
felt
satisfactory
progress
in
that
pursuit
indeed
he
had
made
a
great
deal
more
progress
than
he
himself
was
aware
for
the
fact
was
that
his
own
feelings
such
as
they
were
were
too
much
engaged
to
make
him
quite
so
on
the
subject
as
he
might
have
been
a
bystander
would
probably
have
seen
which
arthur
arden
did
not
that
everything
was
tending
towards
a
very
speedy
crisis
and
that
it
was
perfectly
apparent
how
that
crisis
would
be
decided
had
he
himself
been
cool
enough
to
note
her
looks
her
tremulous
withdrawals
and
sudden
confidences
her
mingled
fear
of
him
and
dependence
upon
him
he
would
have
spoken
before
now
and
all
would
have
been
decided
but
he
was
timid
as
genuine
feeling
always
is
afraid
that
after
all
he
might
be
deceiving
himself
and
that
all
the
evidences
which
he
sometimes
trusted
in
might
mean
nothing
things
were
in
this
exciting
state
when
his
eyes
were
opened
to
see
the
cloudy
countenance
of
pimpernel
and
the
affronted
looks
of
alice
he
was
late
at
breakfast
as
he
always
was
a
thing
which
had
been
regarded
as
a
very
good
joke
when
he
first
came
to
the
red
house
has
been
gone
for
an
hour
alice
had
been
wont
to
say
looking
at
her
watch
and
pimpernel
would
shake
her
head
at
him
arden
it
is
just
as
well
you
have
no
house
to
keep
in
order
she
would
say
think
whatever
you
do
when
you
are
married
you
fashionable
but
now
the
comments
were
of
a
very
different
character
am
afraid
the
coffee
is
cold
pimpernel
said
looking
hot
enough
herself
to
warm
any
amount
of
coffee
is
so
unfortunate
that
we
can
not
make
our
hours
suit
and
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
i
must
give
the
housekeeper
her
orders
before
it
is
quite
the
middle
of
the
day
i
so
very
late
i
am
dreadfully
sorry
said
arthur
appealing
to
alice
who
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
looking
shyly
spiteful
and
who
remained
for
a
moment
undecided
whether
to
follow
her
mother
or
to
put
on
an
aspect
of
civility
and
stay
no
arden
i
mean
i
tell
mamma
thinks
we
see
so
very
little
of
you
now
you
see
little
of
me
ah
yes
i
remember
you
were
in
liverpool
yesterday
shopping
and
i
found
the
house
all
desolate
when
i
came
back
you
think
how
dreary
it
looks
when
you
are
away
this
suggestion
of
your
gives
me
so
much
work
in
the
afternoon
arden
a
suggestion
of
you
not
know
did
you
think
it
was
by
my
own
inclination
that
i
was
at
work
all
day
long
said
arthur
much
higher
an
opinion
you
must
have
of
me
than
i
deserve
does
pimpernel
think
it
is
all
my
doing
no
i
am
not
so
good
as
that
i
am
going
over
the
family
papers
on
your
suggestion
trying
to
find
out
something
most
likely
i
shall
write
a
book
arden
cried
alice
pimpernel
most
likely
i
shall
write
a
book
you
think
how
many
interesting
stories
there
are
in
the
family
should
you
like
me
to
tell
you
one
this
morning
before
the
children
are
ready
for
their
croquet
i
know
if
i
can
do
it
well
but
if
you
like
arden
i
should
like
it
so
much
come
out
on
the
lawn
said
arthur
know
a
spot
where
it
will
be
delicious
this
warm
morning
to
lie
on
the
grass
and
tell
you
about
our
spanish
lady
did
you
ever
hear
of
our
spanish
lady
it
was
she
who
gave
us
our
olive
complexions
and
our
black
arden
alice
cried
dazzled
by
the
prospect
wait
please
till
i
fetch
my
work
and
she
hurried
away
into
the
leaving
him
to
finish
his
breakfast
alice
ran
across
her
mother
in
the
hall
as
she
crossed
from
one
room
to
the
other
her
pretty
complexion
was
heightened
and
her
eyes
shining
with
pleasure
and
interest
mamma
i
am
going
out
to
the
lawn
to
hear
arden
tell
a
story
she
cried
the
spanish
lady
a
family
story
and
oh
he
says
he
does
not
go
away
for
his
own
pleasure
but
because
of
something
papa
put
into
his
head
fancy
papa
is
all
very
well
said
pimpernel
papa
indeed
but
i
happen
to
know
better
your
papa
only
told
him
if
he
could
find
a
flaw
in
the
title
your
papa
is
a
great
deal
too
liberal
alice
offering
to
help
people
that
have
not
a
penny
to
bless
themselves
with
as
if
it
could
ever
be
anything
to
us
or
as
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
gratitude
in
the
mamma
hush
whispered
alice
pointing
to
the
open
door
of
the
through
which
arthur
heard
every
word
that
was
said
and
then
she
added
plaintively
with
ready
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
i
go
suppose
he
thinks
we
are
all
to
be
ready
as
soon
as
he
holds
up
his
little
finger
said
the
indignant
mother
and
then
she
paused
and
calmed
herself
down
want
you
to
be
uncivil
alice
she
added
still
much
to
edification
who
heard
every
word
long
as
he
is
your
guest
of
course
you
must
be
polite
to
him
oh
yes
you
can
go
but
mind
you
stay
too
long
or
expose
yourself
to
the
sun
and
forget
that
i
expect
my
daughter
to
show
a
little
proper
poor
alice
lingered
for
a
long
time
in
the
hall
before
she
had
courage
to
rejoin
the
guest
who
must
have
heard
everything
that
was
said
she
made
believe
to
return
to
the
to
look
for
something
else
which
she
had
forgotten
and
it
was
not
till
arthur
himself
who
was
much
more
amused
than
angry
had
leisurely
ended
his
breakfast
and
strolled
out
into
the
hall
that
she
ventured
to
join
him
arden
i
am
so
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
she
cried
mind
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
wait
he
said
smiling
and
took
the
basket
with
her
work
out
of
her
hand
he
took
her
to
the
very
shadiest
seat
brought
her
a
footstool
arranged
everything
for
her
with
an
air
of
devotion
which
went
to
the
heart
of
alice
and
then
he
threw
himself
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
and
prepared
to
tell
his
tale
chapter
xiv
pimpernel
considered
that
she
did
well
to
be
angry
it
was
all
very
well
for
her
husband
to
put
off
and
give
him
time
but
a
man
who
did
not
show
proper
respect
to
herself
and
alice
was
certainly
not
a
man
to
be
encouraged
in
the
house
she
was
glad
she
had
had
the
opportunity
of
throwing
that
arrow
at
him
from
the
hall
and
letting
him
see
that
she
was
not
so
as
other
people
but
as
the
morning
went
on
she
cast
several
glances
from
more
than
one
window
upon
the
scene
on
the
lawn
which
was
a
very
pretty
scene
alice
was
seated
quite
in
the
shade
with
her
worsted
work
and
her
basket
of
wools
the
wools
so
bright
and
her
dress
so
light
and
cool
against
the
shady
green
background
and
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
lay
arthur
arden
so
fine
a
contrast
in
his
dark
manhood
to
her
fairness
he
was
a
little
too
old
perhaps
to
make
the
contrast
perfect
but
he
was
still
very
handsome
and
had
about
him
a
certain
air
of
youth
such
as
often
clings
to
an
unmarried
vagrant
he
lay
looking
up
at
alice
telling
his
story
and
alice
with
her
head
dreamily
bent
over
her
work
sat
rapt
and
listened
as
the
narrative
went
on
her
interest
became
too
great
for
her
work
she
dropped
the
web
on
her
knee
and
clasped
her
hands
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
teller
of
the
tale
arden
she
exclaimed
by
intervals
carried
away
by
her
excitement
pimpernel
took
views
of
this
group
from
all
the
bedrooms
on
that
side
of
the
house
and
then
she
went
downstairs
and
seated
herself
at
the
window
and
studied
it
at
her
leisure
her
thoughts
changed
gradually
as
she
gazed
arden
looking
up
at
alice
and
alice
shyly
gazing
down
at
arden
were
arguments
of
the
most
convincing
character
after
all
probably
he
had
been
making
a
sacrifice
of
himself
that
cousin
of
his
could
not
possibly
be
so
charming
as
alice
who
was
open
to
every
new
interest
and
made
such
a
flattering
absorbed
listener
is
what
the
men
like
pimpernel
said
to
herself
is
not
clever
poor
love
but
they
never
like
women
to
be
and
then
after
a
long
interval
she
added
still
within
herself
wonder
a
bit
if
he
was
frightened
for
the
yes
no
doubt
that
was
it
he
had
to
conciliate
her
and
pretend
to
be
fond
of
her
society
all
he
is
always
here
all
the
evening
she
went
on
softening
more
and
more
and
the
result
was
that
at
length
she
took
down
a
broad
hat
which
hung
in
the
hall
and
stepped
out
herself
to
join
the
garden
party
look
so
comfortable
and
there
is
evidently
something
so
interesting
going
on
that
i
should
like
to
have
a
share
she
said
in
a
voice
so
softened
that
arthur
instantly
felt
his
device
had
succeeded
go
on
please
i
can
always
imagine
what
has
gone
before
go
over
it
again
for
mamma
it
is
so
exciting
cried
alice
was
one
of
the
ardens
you
know
that
was
a
sailor
and
went
abroad
and
then
he
took
a
town
out
in
south
america
and
then
the
daughter
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
whole
place
oh
mamma
and
that
is
why
all
the
ardens
have
black
hair
and
blue
arden
of
arden
has
not
black
hair
and
blue
eyes
said
pimpernel
said
arthur
very
distinctly
and
emphatically
he
did
not
add
another
syllable
the
very
brevity
of
his
reply
was
full
of
significance
and
told
its
own
story
and
pimpernel
looked
upon
him
with
more
and
more
favourable
eyes
you
find
out
all
this
in
the
papers
at
arden
she
resumed
nice
it
must
be
i
do
respect
an
old
family
my
grandmother
though
pimpernel
will
never
hear
of
it
he
says
he
has
enriched
himself
by
his
own
exertions
and
he
is
not
ashamed
of
it
and
have
any
pretensions
made
just
like
a
impetuosity
but
my
own
grandmother
was
a
blundell
arden
i
often
think
i
can
trace
a
resemblance
between
my
alice
and
the
blundells
does
miss
arden
go
over
the
papers
with
you
may
i
ask
when
you
are
at
the
hall
arthur
was
so
much
taken
by
surprise
that
he
was
afraid
he
blushed
but
his
looks
were
less
treacherous
than
he
thought
them
to
be
and
it
did
not
show
no
i
mean
the
first
day
she
gave
the
old
bureau
up
to
me
he
said
faltering
a
little
showed
a
little
interest
too
but
my
cousin
clare
i
am
sorry
you
do
not
know
clare
a
little
better
pimpernel
it
would
do
her
good
to
come
under
your
influence
she
wants
a
little
womanly
trifling
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
she
is
always
full
of
such
high
designs
and
plans
for
everybody
she
is
little
tiresome
sometimes
and
oh
i
see
exactly
pimpernel
replied
nodding
her
head
too
clever
for
him
evidently
men
all
clever
women
she
said
inwardly
with
a
smile
while
arthur
with
a
savage
desire
to
cut
his
own
throat
or
fly
at
hers
after
his
treachery
to
clare
got
hold
of
the
basket
of
wools
and
scattered
them
wildly
about
the
grass
he
broke
the
basket
and
he
was
glad
it
would
have
been
a
satisfaction
to
his
mind
if
he
could
have
trampled
upon
all
the
and
thrown
stones
at
the
windows
of
the
peaceful
house
arden
never
mind
said
alice
basket
does
not
matter
it
was
not
a
dear
basket
oh
please
never
mind
go
on
with
the
spanish
lady
i
do
want
so
much
to
was
a
spanish
lady
and
she
loved
an
englishman
said
arthur
making
an
effort
and
resuming
his
tale
he
did
not
dislike
alice
there
was
no
impulse
upon
him
to
fly
upon
her
and
shake
her
or
do
anything
but
be
very
civil
and
gentle
to
the
pretty
inoffensive
girl
in
short
he
was
like
all
men
the
young
fresh
creature
exercised
a
certain
influence
over
him
by
reason
of
her
beauty
but
the
elder
woman
was
simply
an
inferior
being
of
his
own
species
a
weaker
man
in
disguise
whom
he
dared
not
treat
as
he
would
a
man
and
accordingly
hated
with
a
double
hatred
pimpernel
perhaps
would
scarcely
have
objected
to
the
sentiment
she
had
as
little
refinement
of
the
heart
as
he
had
and
was
ready
to
use
all
the
privileges
of
her
sex
as
weapons
of
offence
to
goad
and
madden
with
them
any
man
who
was
any
way
obnoxious
to
her
knows
he
can
not
take
me
in
i
am
not
a
simpleton
to
be
deceived
by
his
fair
talk
and
i
know
he
hates
me
she
would
have
said
with
real
triumph
but
in
the
meantime
he
was
obliged
to
keep
the
peace
so
he
resumed
his
story
the
hour
of
luncheon
was
approaching
and
after
that
would
come
the
welcome
hour
when
for
three
or
four
days
back
he
had
been
able
to
escape
from
all
the
pimpernels
but
he
did
not
dare
to
make
his
escape
that
day
and
while
he
told
his
romantic
tale
he
was
painfully
contriving
how
he
should
manage
to
send
word
to
clare
and
wondering
if
she
would
miss
him
it
would
be
a
dreary
business
for
himself
giving
up
the
day
to
croquet
and
pimpernels
would
clare
feel
the
disappointment
too
would
the
house
be
lonely
to
her
without
him
his
heart
gave
a
leap
and
he
felt
for
a
moment
as
if
he
was
certain
it
would
be
lonely
curiously
this
thought
did
not
sadden
but
exhilarate
his
mind
and
then
he
returned
anxiously
to
the
question
how
could
he
without
exciting
suspicion
have
a
note
sent
to
clare
the
ladies
were
so
interested
that
they
neglected
the
sound
of
the
luncheon
bell
and
did
not
even
perform
that
washing
of
hands
which
gives
a
man
space
to
breathe
they
did
not
budge
in
short
until
the
butler
came
out
solemn
in
his
black
clothes
to
intimate
that
their
meal
awaited
them
and
arthur
in
dismay
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
offer
his
arm
to
his
hostess
it
was
a
hot
day
and
the
luncheon
was
hot
too
how
he
loathed
it
and
not
a
moment
left
him
to
write
a
word
explaining
how
it
was
to
clare
arden
you
have
been
so
interesting
that
one
forgot
how
the
time
had
gone
cried
pimpernel
is
an
idle
sort
of
thing
amusing
self
in
the
morning
but
when
one
has
such
a
temptation
it
was
quite
as
good
as
any
novel
i
declare
mamma
arden
said
he
was
perhaps
going
to
write
a
book
said
alice
who
had
grown
bolder
after
this
whole
long
morning
which
had
been
given
up
to
herself
would
be
very
nice
said
pimpernel
with
affable
patronage
pimpernel
would
take
copies
at
once
i
am
sure
how
i
envy
talent
arden
it
is
the
only
thing
i
covet
and
to
find
all
your
materials
in
your
own
family
of
that
said
arthur
must
make
a
run
up
to
the
rectory
after
luncheon
to
see
mr
fielding
i
have
a
question
to
ask
at
this
he
could
see
brow
cloud
over
at
once
and
the
look
of
suspicion
and
angry
distrust
come
back
to
her
face
alice
was
better
advised
she
looked
down
on
the
table
and
broke
a
piece
of
bread
in
little
pieces
which
answered
nearly
as
well
as
a
glove
to
button
arden
she
said
thought
this
day
you
were
going
to
stay
with
us
i
thought
we
were
really
to
have
had
a
game
at
croquet
my
dear
attempt
to
interfere
with
engagements
said
pimpernel
with
a
forced
laugh
are
always
so
much
happier
when
they
have
their
own
do
ladies
dislike
their
own
way
said
arthur
but
he
was
in
the
toils
and
could
not
escape
am
looking
forward
to
my
game
of
croquet
he
said
i
have
no
engagements
i
will
do
my
business
with
mr
fielding
while
you
are
putting
on
your
hat
it
will
not
take
me
twenty
minutes
he
is
a
good
old
soul
he
is
as
fond
of
the
ardens
as
if
they
were
his
own
children
but
not
all
the
ardens
i
think
he
does
not
approve
of
mr
arden
nonsense
cried
alice
decidedly
her
mother
did
not
say
anything
but
a
rapid
calculation
ran
through
her
mind
if
the
rector
did
not
like
arthur
he
could
not
be
going
to
meet
clare
at
the
rectory
and
mr
fielding
had
been
quite
civil
really
very
civil
to
herself
she
did
not
see
any
reason
to
fear
him
you
are
in
a
hurry
for
your
croquet
alice
she
said
graciously
only
thing
is
to
send
the
carriage
to
take
arden
there
and
that
would
be
so
nice
cried
alice
with
transport
but
arthur
was
of
a
very
different
frame
of
mind
the
carriage
he
said
within
himself
but
his
outward
speech
was
more
civil
he
had
not
the
least
occasion
for
it
he
would
so
much
rather
not
give
trouble
a
walk
would
be
good
for
him
he
should
like
it
at
last
his
earnestness
prevailed
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
his
sense
of
relief
when
he
walked
out
into
the
blazing
afternoon
along
the
dusty
shadeless
road
that
led
to
the
village
he
had
got
free
from
them
for
the
moment
but
he
could
not
rush
to
arden
in
the
allotted
to
him
he
could
not
secure
for
himself
a
peep
at
clare
he
did
not
even
feel
that
he
could
trust
the
rector
to
deliver
his
note
for
him
and
where
was
he
to
write
his
note
and
what
would
clare
think
would
she
despise
him
for
his
subserviency
to
the
pimpernels
and
why
should
he
be
subservient
to
them
arthur
knew
very
well
why
he
would
have
to
abandon
his
researches
altogether
and
leave
to
chance
the
furtherance
of
his
designs
upon
clare
if
he
had
to
leave
the
red
house
is
lawful
in
love
and
in
war
he
said
to
himself
it
was
both
love
and
war
he
was
carrying
on
love
to
the
sister
war
to
the
brother
and
with
such
a
double
pursuit
surely
a
little
was
permissible
to
him
if
to
any
man
in
the
world
but
he
did
not
reach
the
rectory
nor
run
the
risk
of
enmity
that
day
he
had
not
gone
half
way
up
the
village
when
he
bethought
himself
of
a
much
safer
medium
in
the
shape
of
old
sarah
cottage
was
very
quiet
when
he
reached
the
door
neither
mary
the
nor
ellen
the
sempstress
were
visible
in
it
and
sarah
herself
was
not
to
be
seen
he
gave
a
glance
in
at
the
door
into
the
little
living
room
which
looked
cool
and
green
all
shaded
with
the
big
geranium
the
place
was
quite
silent
too
but
in
the
corner
near
the
stair
sat
a
little
figure
with
bright
hair
braided
and
head
bent
over
its
work
by
jove
said
arthur
arden
and
he
forgot
note
he
forgot
alice
pimpernel
who
was
waiting
for
him
he
went
in
and
sat
down
by
her
in
that
safe
and
tempting
solitude
you
all
alone
he
said
to
keep
you
company
and
nothing
but
that
stupid
work
to
amuse
you
i
am
better
than
that
you
think
jeanie
come
and
talk
a
little
to
said
jeanie
with
a
little
start
and
then
she
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
no
feared
for
you
now
i
see
no
but
i
can
not
believe
you
when
you
speak
eh
dreadful
to
say
to
one
like
you
dreadful
said
arthur
laughing
and
drawing
closer
to
her
dreadful
jeanie
that
you
must
be
very
kind
to
me
to
make
up
for
having
said
it
you
believe
me
not
when
i
tell
you
are
the
loveliest
little
creature
i
ever
saw
and
i
am
very
fond
of
you
you
must
believe
that
i
should
like
to
take
you
away
to
a
much
prettier
house
than
this
and
give
you
all
kinds
of
beautiful
jeanie
looked
at
him
with
steadfast
eyes
not
a
blush
touched
her
face
not
the
slightest
gleam
of
consciousness
came
into
her
quiet
steady
gaze
a
dreadful
thing
to
say
of
a
man
she
said
man
should
be
a
shelter
from
the
storm
and
a
covert
from
the
tempest
in
the
bible
so
but
no
shelter
to
anybody
poor
man
growing
old
and
yet
ye
never
learn
jove
said
arthur
rising
up
he
had
forgotten
both
clare
and
alice
for
the
moment
and
this
little
cottager
was
avenging
them
but
yet
the
reproof
was
so
whimsical
that
it
diverted
him
you
know
you
are
a
very
uncivil
little
girl
he
said
you
not
afraid
to
speak
to
me
so
and
you
quite
alone
no
feared
for
you
now
said
jeanie
was
silly
when
i
was
feared
there
is
nothing
you
could
do
to
me
even
if
ye
wanted
and
no
so
ill
a
man
as
to
want
to
harm
you
for
your
good
opinion
said
arthur
there
are
a
great
many
things
i
could
do
i
could
give
you
pretty
dresses
and
a
carriage
and
everything
you
can
think
of
and
if
you
were
very
sweet
and
kind
to
me
arden
said
a
voice
over
his
shoulders
you
have
business
with
jeanie
maybe
it
would
be
mair
simple
and
straightforward
if
ye
would
settle
it
with
arthur
turned
round
with
a
mixture
of
rage
and
dismay
and
found
himself
confronting
perfitt
who
stood
stern
and
serious
in
the
doorway
he
had
need
of
all
his
readiness
of
mind
to
meet
such
an
emergency
he
paused
a
moment
feeling
himself
at
bay
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
lose
his
head
even
in
so
disagreeable
a
crisis
business
is
not
with
jeanie
he
said
briskly
business
is
with
old
sarah
who
is
not
to
be
found
but
you
will
do
quite
as
well
perfitt
i
want
to
send
a
note
to
miss
arden
if
jeanie
will
get
me
some
paper
do
you
understand
me
little
one
could
you
give
me
some
paper
to
write
a
little
letter
poor
child
do
you
think
she
understands
thus
he
got
the
better
of
both
the
protector
and
protected
jeanie
who
had
been
impervious
to
all
else
blushed
crimson
at
this
doubt
of
her
understanding
and
so
did
perfitt
no
like
an
innocent
or
a
natural
been
well
brought
up
and
well
learned
the
scotchman
said
with
natural
and
national
indignation
i
thought
she
was
an
unmistakable
innocent
said
arthur
and
thus
it
came
about
that
note
was
written
after
all
chapter
xv
these
days
of
mutual
study
had
been
very
sweet
to
clare
they
had
soothed
her
out
of
her
agitation
without
however
stilling
it
altogether
she
had
acquired
a
new
habit
and
it
was
pleasant
while
arthur
sat
at
the
great
table
with
the
old
which
her
father
had
partially
arranged
and
prepared
she
sat
at
the
bureau
going
over
hosts
of
letters
which
sometimes
amused
sometimes
interested
her
but
which
were
for
the
greater
part
quite
unimportant
old
bills
and
receipts
and
invitations
the
broken
fragments
and
relics
of
social
life
if
there
had
been
any
excitement
in
her
mind
to
begin
with
as
it
was
natural
there
should
be
when
she
felt
herself
thus
standing
as
it
were
on
the
edge
of
any
secrets
which
her
father
might
have
had
it
all
died
away
on
the
first
day
how
innocent
the
life
must
have
been
of
which
only
such
harmless
evidences
remained
there
were
letters
from
some
of
his
old
friends
some
with
dead
jokes
in
them
and
dead
pieces
of
news
embalmed
and
preserved
as
if
they
were
worth
preserving
clare
took
a
pleasure
in
these
because
it
was
to
her
father
they
were
addressed
and
she
would
look
up
now
and
then
and
read
a
few
words
aloud
to
her
who
on
his
side
had
many
things
to
communicate
to
her
out
of
his
mss
sometimes
arthur
was
obliged
to
get
up
and
bring
them
to
her
that
she
might
help
him
with
a
difficult
sentence
sometimes
it
was
she
who
had
to
call
him
they
were
such
near
relations
their
interest
in
the
family
was
almost
the
same
and
it
was
very
natural
that
they
should
constantly
refer
to
and
consult
each
other
sometimes
a
momentary
compunction
crossed
mind
when
she
thought
of
her
brother
would
he
like
it
would
not
he
prefer
to
go
over
these
papers
himself
and
be
the
first
to
discover
his
secrets
if
there
were
any
secrets
but
he
would
not
care
for
them
clare
thought
to
herself
he
confessed
openly
that
his
interest
in
the
ardens
was
limited
whereas
her
own
interest
was
without
limits
if
she
felt
sometimes
a
more
lively
compunction
still
at
the
thought
that
she
was
absolutely
foiling
all
precautions
and
making
his
unwilling
absence
from
home
ridiculous
by
receiving
thus
if
not
secretly
still
without
avowal
the
visits
of
her
cousin
her
natural
pride
arose
and
put
the
whisper
down
should
i
give
in
to
edgar
she
asked
herself
is
my
life
not
his
that
is
concerned
it
is
my
happiness
that
is
concerned
i
took
care
of
myself
before
edgar
came
and
why
do
i
need
his
guardianship
now
this
view
of
the
matter
made
it
almost
a
duty
to
balk
him
had
she
foreseen
that
arthur
was
going
to
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
course
she
would
have
told
her
brother
but
she
did
not
know
nobody
could
be
more
surprised
than
she
was
to
find
him
with
the
pimpernels
and
it
was
no
pleasure
to
her
but
quite
the
reverse
that
he
should
be
with
the
pimpernels
besides
it
might
justify
and
strengthen
edgar
in
his
democratic
ways
if
he
heard
that
his
cousin
so
much
more
true
an
arden
than
himself
was
staying
at
the
red
house
accordingly
she
wrote
to
her
brother
less
frequently
than
usual
and
said
nothing
about
arthur
which
was
not
perhaps
quite
what
edgar
might
have
expected
from
his
sister
probably
if
he
heard
of
it
he
would
manage
in
some
insidious
way
to
get
her
carried
off
to
town
which
clare
detested
or
he
would
return
himself
which
in
present
circumstances
clare
did
not
desire
so
she
let
the
days
run
on
finding
a
subtle
sweetness
in
them
there
was
nothing
said
between
her
kinsman
and
herself
which
all
the
world
might
not
have
heard
except
perhaps
by
times
a
tone
an
inflection
of
voice
an
almost
imperceptible
inference
arthur
was
skilful
in
such
ways
of
making
himself
secretly
understood
but
he
said
nothing
to
agitate
or
alarm
her
and
thus
they
went
on
with
their
respective
pursuits
side
by
side
what
could
be
more
sober
more
grave
less
like
any
sentiment
or
romance
or
nonsense
but
clare
in
those
hours
which
were
thus
sensibly
and
seriously
spent
all
the
evening
she
remembered
all
the
morning
she
looked
for
them
she
had
not
been
into
the
village
for
a
week
she
had
not
seen
the
rector
except
at
church
nor
any
of
her
old
friends
she
took
her
evening
ramble
through
the
park
all
alone
and
happy
to
be
alone
is
just
as
it
used
to
be
she
said
to
herself
but
clare
knew
very
well
that
it
was
not
as
it
used
to
be
even
now
a
dread
of
the
arrival
of
some
friendly
visitor
bent
upon
taking
care
of
her
would
sometimes
overcloud
her
mind
if
they
but
knew
how
she
detested
being
taken
care
of
if
they
but
understood
how
happy
she
could
be
alone
and
thus
it
was
with
her
on
the
morning
of
that
day
which
arthur
spent
playing
croquet
and
telling
stories
to
alice
pimpernel
she
had
got
safely
over
the
post
and
her
letters
there
was
not
one
from
old
miss
arden
at
escott
proposing
a
visit
such
as
from
day
to
day
she
trembled
to
receive
neither
did
old
governess
seldon
throw
herself
upon
her
hospitality
and
though
edgar
begged
her
again
to
reconsider
her
decision
and
join
him
for
at
least
a
week
or
two
see
the
pictures
there
was
no
violence
of
urgency
in
his
letter
she
was
safe
for
another
day
and
the
sunny
hours
were
drawing
on
bringing
the
afternoon
and
its
visitor
shall
finish
that
first
drawer
clare
said
to
herself
with
a
exaggeration
of
the
importance
of
her
work
she
went
into
the
library
more
than
once
to
see
that
all
was
ready
that
the
shutters
were
closed
to
keep
out
the
noonday
sun
and
the
basket
cleared
of
all
the
fragments
that
had
been
thrown
into
it
is
odd
how
pleasant
such
an
occupation
can
grow
she
said
to
herself
so
much
wonder
at
the
passion
for
old
papers
that
some
people
she
liked
to
keep
this
thought
well
before
her
mind
her
new
study
was
so
curious
and
full
of
interest
such
a
lesson
too
in
life
the
smallest
details
of
which
were
so
absorbing
as
long
as
it
lasted
so
sadly
amusingly
insignificant
now
day
or
other
some
one
will
read
my
letters
like
that
she
would
add
with
an
incredulous
smile
it
was
impossible
and
yet
no
doubt
it
would
come
to
pass
but
would
any
one
ever
know
how
full
and
strong
the
blood
was
running
in
her
veins
how
vigorous
life
was
and
warm
and
intense
never
before
in
her
life
had
she
so
felt
the
power
of
the
present
the
moment
that
was
hers
whatever
might
be
taken
from
her
the
clock
was
about
to
strike
and
by
this
time
no
doubt
he
was
coming
up
the
avenue
her
and
the
pleasantest
work
she
had
ever
tried
was
about
to
begin
clare
sat
down
to
her
tapestry
to
occupy
the
moment
till
he
should
arrive
he
was
very
exact
generally
punctual
to
his
hour
it
surprised
her
when
the
little
french
clock
chimed
a
it
was
strange
it
gave
her
a
little
chill
in
the
midst
of
her
expectation
but
of
course
it
could
only
be
accidental
another
chime
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
what
if
he
should
not
be
coming
clare
had
known
little
of
the
vicissitudes
to
which
such
intercourse
as
this
is
specially
subject
except
the
few
days
of
utter
loneliness
which
she
had
passed
after
departure
none
of
the
heats
and
chills
of
wooing
had
ever
been
hers
she
had
been
mistress
of
the
situation
it
had
been
in
her
power
to
send
him
away
to
discourage
him
and
remind
him
that
he
was
utterly
at
her
mercy
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
such
power
is
mutual
and
that
she
too
was
at
his
mercy
as
she
waited
and
listened
and
heard
nothing
her
heart
began
to
beat
high
and
loud
not
only
or
even
in
the
first
place
was
it
mere
disappointment
a
certain
angry
amazement
and
wild
pride
sprang
up
along
with
it
what
slight
her
neglect
to
come
when
she
expected
him
it
was
an
enormity
which
startled
clare
and
shook
her
mind
to
its
foundations
she
could
not
understand
nor
believe
it
and
yet
she
could
not
believe
either
the
suggestions
of
accident
which
she
tried
to
make
to
herself
could
it
be
intentional
neglect
discourtesy
and
to
her
then
there
came
another
chime
and
then
the
hour
he
was
a
whole
hour
behind
time
clare
bent
her
head
over
her
tapestry
as
she
heard
a
footstep
approaching
and
laboured
as
if
she
were
labouring
for
her
daily
bread
a
hot
steady
flush
of
angry
excitement
came
to
her
cheek
she
would
not
raise
her
head
to
see
who
it
was
had
he
broken
his
leg
it
might
have
been
some
excuse
but
if
it
was
he
who
was
walking
into
the
room
as
she
supposed
of
course
he
had
not
broken
his
leg
the
first
thing
she
saw
however
was
hand
suddenly
appearing
before
her
holding
a
silver
tray
with
a
letter
upon
it
she
took
it
with
a
sense
that
some
one
had
given
her
a
blow
this
all
she
said
mechanically
perfitt
is
waiting
downstairs
to
see
you
miss
arden
if
you
will
please
to
receive
him
said
wilkins
perfitt
what
could
he
have
to
do
with
hope
nothing
has
happened
said
clare
holding
as
if
it
were
a
serpent
the
letter
in
her
hand
think
so
miss
arden
only
he
would
like
to
speak
a
word
to
you
if
you
are
not
too
am
much
too
busy
said
clare
in
her
anger
mean
let
him
come
up
in
five
minutes
she
added
waving
her
hand
to
the
alarmed
servant
then
she
tore
open
note
dear
cousin
a
cursed
chance
forgive
the
adjective
i
help
it
keeps
me
from
arden
i
have
been
fighting
and
struggling
all
the
morning
but
i
can
not
get
off
imagine
how
i
hate
the
day
and
everything
round
me
to
have
to
stay
and
be
bored
to
death
instead
of
going
on
with
the
work
most
interesting
to
me
in
the
world
please
postpone
yours
till
i
shall
go
crazy
if
i
think
you
are
at
it
without
in
the
deepest
wretchedness
and
devotion
ever
yours
clare
read
it
twice
over
and
then
put
it
from
her
she
stopped
herself
for
the
first
moment
from
all
expression
even
in
her
own
mind
she
took
up
her
needle
and
went
on
again
furiously
ye
know
ye
youths
and
maidens
how
the
air
all
darkened
round
her
how
the
day
became
odious
he
think
it
matters
to
me
i
wonder
she
said
at
length
aloud
and
laughed
and
then
threw
her
work
down
and
covered
her
face
and
burst
into
violent
tears
they
must
have
been
lying
very
near
the
surface
they
fell
so
hot
and
so
suddenly
and
were
over
so
soon
when
perfitt
was
ushered
in
five
minutes
later
he
found
miss
arden
seated
with
her
usual
dignity
a
little
flushed
but
showing
no
other
traces
of
that
sudden
tumult
perfitt
himself
was
considerably
disturbed
he
crushed
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
seated
himself
when
she
graciously
invited
him
to
be
seated
on
the
very
edge
of
his
chair
arden
he
said
come
to
make
a
bit
complaint
indeed
no
a
complaint
rather
that
you
might
maybe
speak
a
warning
word
young
to
meddle
or
trouble
with
such
things
but
no
like
other
young
ladies
you
aye
were
the
grand
authority
in
old
time
and
so
ye
are
with
the
present
lad
i
mean
with
the
present
you
please
tell
me
what
it
is
i
am
very
busy
said
clare
anything
happened
perfitt
of
course
i
am
the
only
person
to
refer
to
in
my
absence
whatever
it
may
no
just
that
anything
has
happened
said
perfitt
crushing
his
hat
and
then
anxiously
examining
its
wounds
a
thing
i
would
ask
nobody
about
but
soon
settle
if
it
was
not
a
gentleman
connected
with
the
house
you
see
me
that
brought
arthur
note
but
i
got
it
like
by
chance
turning
in
as
i
was
passing
to
see
little
jeanie
murray
see
what
meaning
now
a
gentleman
that
has
always
behaved
gentlemanly
to
me
but
a
bit
lassie
miss
arden
and
no
just
right
in
her
mind
no
mad
no
meaning
that
but
scarce
wise
enough
to
understand
a
nonsense
that
such
a
gentleman
arthur
arden
with
jeanie
now
said
clare
in
her
most
distinct
chill
tones
she
had
been
frozen
suddenly
where
she
sat
frozen
to
her
very
heart
but
the
shock
had
brought
her
back
to
perfect
possession
of
herself
na
trust
me
for
that
said
perfitt
with
a
laugh
i
left
the
house
i
saw
my
lord
off
the
premises
ye
may
trust
me
for
that
and
nae
harm
done
miss
arden
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suppose
any
harm
but
arthur
was
aye
a
thought
wild
saving
your
presence
will
take
care
said
clare
steadily
it
does
not
occur
her
voice
was
frozen
too
in
the
shadowy
warmth
of
the
room
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
afternoon
it
went
like
a
touch
of
ice
through
bones
how
will
she
manage
that
i
would
like
to
know
he
said
to
himself
but
was
so
chilled
that
he
only
gasped
audibly
and
had
no
other
answer
to
make
will
take
care
it
does
not
occur
again
said
clare
were
quite
right
to
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
else
you
want
to
say
pray
go
else
nothing
else
miss
arden
said
perfitt
stumbling
to
his
feet
and
then
he
stood
awkwardly
clasping
his
hat
for
a
minute
more
i
have
no
fear
on
my
mind
that
any
been
done
he
added
no
harm
done
miss
arden
i
wouldna
give
you
a
wrong
idea
but
only
arthur
have
told
you
repeated
clare
still
more
and
more
coldly
it
shall
not
occur
chapter
xvi
perfitt
went
away
from
arden
as
indeed
he
had
gone
to
the
house
in
a
very
perplexed
and
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
have
great
doubts
in
my
mind
if
i
should
have
spoken
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
away
and
then
all
at
once
there
flashed
upon
him
a
report
he
had
once
heard
which
connected
arthur
name
with
that
of
clare
when
he
recalled
this
he
slapped
himself
upon
the
thigh
with
supreme
man
gone
and
put
your
foot
in
it
now
he
thought
you
no
have
taken
care
of
your
ain
flesh
and
blood
yourself
without
bothering
that
poor
lassie
dash
ye
and
dash
him
the
this
was
how
perfitt
contemplated
his
own
conduct
as
he
went
away
but
it
was
a
very
different
kind
of
that
he
left
behind
clare
was
absolutely
stunned
by
the
blow
which
had
just
fallen
upon
her
had
she
taken
time
to
think
no
doubt
she
would
have
seen
that
she
was
unjust
but
she
did
not
take
any
time
to
think
it
was
the
first
great
slight
she
had
ever
received
in
her
life
a
slight
greater
than
any
other
kind
of
disrespect
that
could
be
shown
to
a
woman
a
man
who
had
been
devoting
himself
to
her
who
had
caught
at
every
opportunity
for
showing
his
devotion
since
the
moment
he
reappeared
at
arden
that
he
should
venture
to
go
and
excuse
himself
to
her
on
the
ground
of
inevitable
engagements
and
then
be
discovered
hanging
about
a
village
girl
recommending
himself
so
potently
that
her
friends
interfered
oh
how
glad
she
was
how
grateful
to
perfitt
for
bringing
that
complaint
to
her
she
might
never
have
known
she
might
have
believed
that
he
was
worthy
and
that
he
loved
her
but
for
that
revelation
she
was
grateful
to
perfitt
and
yet
how
she
hated
him
but
for
him
she
might
still
have
been
partially
happy
she
would
have
received
the
excuse
and
all
might
have
been
well
that
was
to
say
she
would
have
allowed
herself
to
be
deceived
which
of
all
fates
was
surely
the
meanest
and
most
humiliating
and
then
to
think
how
much
good
she
had
intended
to
her
cousin
in
this
moment
of
bitter
humiliation
clare
ceased
to
trifle
with
herself
she
tore
off
the
veil
which
she
had
wrapt
so
willingly
over
her
eyes
and
admitted
to
herself
that
she
had
meant
to
bestow
everything
upon
her
kinsman
she
had
even
gone
the
length
of
being
quite
content
to
despoil
her
brother
for
his
sake
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
old
arden
should
be
his
and
that
if
she
could
not
make
him
the
head
of
the
family
she
would
at
least
secure
to
him
its
oldest
possessions
all
this
she
admitted
to
herself
in
the
tumult
of
rage
and
shame
which
filled
her
mind
she
was
ready
to
do
all
this
and
he
he
could
not
sacrifice
to
her
a
passing
fancy
for
the
pretty
face
of
a
girl
for
there
could
be
nothing
more
than
that
in
it
and
where
was
the
mother
who
should
have
taken
charge
of
the
girl
clare
tried
hard
to
persuade
herself
that
it
was
fault
or
that
the
grandmother
had
some
artful
design
upon
arthur
she
tried
very
hard
to
believe
that
she
believed
this
but
it
was
a
difficult
attempt
the
thought
came
back
to
her
with
renewed
bitterness
that
it
was
he
he
only
who
was
in
fault
he
to
whom
she
would
have
given
everything
then
her
mind
took
a
sudden
leap
as
the
mind
will
sometimes
do
at
its
own
will
and
pleasure
and
pictured
to
her
what
might
have
happened
had
she
actually
done
what
she
had
been
willing
to
do
the
future
which
had
been
so
likely
an
hour
ago
which
was
so
impossible
now
opened
up
upon
her
with
a
great
flash
and
glow
she
saw
herself
his
wife
dependent
upon
him
for
all
her
happiness
pledged
to
him
for
ever
and
ever
his
honour
hers
his
credit
hers
the
burden
of
any
scandal
of
any
shame
that
might
come
upon
him
to
be
borne
by
her
equally
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
gazing
into
a
mirror
in
which
she
saw
herself
seated
alone
and
neglected
in
the
house
which
she
had
bestowed
upon
him
while
he
himself
roamed
about
the
world
finding
at
every
turn
some
facile
love
some
jeanie
she
said
to
herself
and
yet
was
so
just
that
she
paused
and
blushed
knowing
she
did
an
innocent
creature
wrong
this
extraordinary
revulsion
of
feeling
shook
clare
to
the
very
depths
of
her
being
she
had
been
floating
so
smoothly
down
the
stream
that
she
was
not
aware
how
very
fast
she
had
been
going
and
now
this
sudden
and
terrible
obstacle
seized
her
and
maddened
her
and
enveloped
her
in
a
whirlwind
of
wild
thoughts
as
a
sudden
niagara
might
seize
and
rend
a
she
had
been
prepared
for
some
dangers
he
might
have
got
as
people
say
with
alice
pimpernel
and
been
compelled
by
honour
to
marry
her
for
her
sake
such
a
catastrophe
clare
thought
she
could
have
borne
and
he
might
have
been
a
treacherous
enemy
to
her
brother
for
that
she
had
been
afraid
and
had
prepared
herself
but
for
this
she
was
unprepared
false
to
her
false
to
his
own
interests
wooing
ruin
instead
of
prosperity
giving
up
his
reputation
and
his
life
as
well
as
slighting
the
true
love
she
had
waiting
for
him
oh
how
miserable
how
mean
how
wretched
it
was
was
it
possible
that
he
could
hold
life
so
cheap
as
to
spend
it
thus
and
he
not
a
boy
no
longer
a
boy
who
might
be
tempted
and
led
astray
she
made
an
effort
to
calm
the
wild
misery
in
her
own
breast
by
forgetting
herself
and
making
believe
that
pity
for
him
was
the
only
sentiment
that
moved
her
he
was
a
fool
he
was
mad
she
said
to
herself
and
then
the
something
that
burned
within
her
the
terrible
pain
that
gnawed
and
gnawed
at
her
heart
came
uppermost
it
was
the
first
slight
she
had
ever
received
and
such
a
slight
the
princess
had
found
that
a
beggar
might
be
preferred
to
her
the
proud
upright
spotless
clare
had
discovered
an
attempt
to
deceive
her
the
thought
made
her
writhe
as
any
poor
living
creature
might
writhe
against
the
spear
that
pinned
it
to
the
earth
oh
if
she
could
but
escape
it
forget
throw
arthur
arden
out
of
her
thoughts
but
that
was
impossible
she
had
to
bear
it
and
get
the
better
of
it
if
she
could
and
underneath
there
existed
a
still
deeper
feeling
at
which
clare
almost
trembled
she
would
be
avenged
on
him
one
way
or
other
she
would
punish
him
for
his
inconstancy
and
for
what
was
worse
his
deception
this
incident
should
not
could
not
must
not
pass
over
as
if
it
had
happened
to
any
common
girl
the
intensity
of
her
passion
dismayed
even
herself
she
would
bear
it
so
that
no
man
should
ever
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
he
had
broken
clare
heart
and
she
would
not
bear
it
so
that
no
man
should
dare
believe
it
was
possible
to
slight
her
or
treat
her
as
a
nobody
she
took
up
his
letter
crushing
it
as
if
it
were
a
real
enemy
and
her
eye
caught
the
entreaty
that
she
would
postpone
her
work
as
he
was
obliged
to
postpone
his
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
her
to
be
able
to
contradict
him
practically
and
at
once
she
tore
his
letter
up
into
little
pieces
and
then
she
went
with
a
rapid
step
to
the
library
to
do
instantly
and
energetically
what
he
had
begged
her
not
to
do
was
in
its
way
a
consolation
to
clare
she
had
but
just
entered
the
library
when
a
timid
knock
came
to
the
door
it
was
repeated
again
even
after
she
had
said
languidly
in
in
she
repeated
with
that
impatient
irritability
which
is
natural
to
a
disturbed
and
excited
mind
then
after
a
little
pause
the
head
of
fillpot
the
housekeeper
appeared
timidly
at
the
door
i
speak
a
word
with
you
miss
clare
said
fillpot
in
a
tone
of
fright
in
repeated
clare
this
time
imperiously
the
housekeeper
at
arden
was
an
old
servant
she
had
been
supreme
in
the
house
ever
since
clare
was
born
and
though
miss
decided
character
had
quietly
shorn
her
of
all
transferable
authority
yet
clare
herself
had
sufficient
sense
of
the
value
to
be
respectful
of
opinions
the
housekeeper
had
not
given
in
without
a
struggle
and
she
had
a
great
awe
of
clare
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
conscientious
and
had
an
opinion
of
her
own
so
that
there
was
now
and
then
a
little
skirmishing
between
the
two
always
ending
in
a
victory
for
clare
but
yet
never
without
a
certain
effect
upon
her
fillpot
came
in
with
the
air
of
a
woman
who
had
made
up
her
mind
to
something
desperate
she
gave
a
frightened
glance
round
the
room
and
then
approached
her
young
mistress
beg
your
pardon
miss
clare
she
said
disturbing
you
but
i
thought
arthur
arden
was
here
arthur
arden
is
not
here
you
perceive
said
clare
feeling
as
if
his
name
choked
her
i
should
be
very
glad
to
know
what
you
want
at
once
for
i
am
busy
it
can
wait
till
if
it
is
anything
about
the
is
nothing
about
the
house
said
fillpot
breathing
hard
with
alarm
and
excitement
and
then
she
made
another
pause
which
drove
clare
wild
with
impatience
sake
say
what
it
is
she
cried
leave
me
you
see
i
have
something
to
do
clare
said
fillpot
solemnly
been
about
you
since
you
were
a
baby
when
your
poor
dear
mamma
died
though
it
was
sarah
as
took
you
from
the
month
i
had
all
the
responsibility
when
you
was
a
little
girl
with
governesses
and
that
sort
it
was
always
me
as
was
referred
to
to
tell
me
what
all
this
is
about
said
clare
coldly
see
i
am
engaged
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
think
of
i
want
to
go
over
all
my
childish
days
now
clare
not
my
wish
to
make
myself
disagreeable
it
never
was
said
fillpot
growing
breathless
when
i
see
things
going
on
as
are
not
what
they
should
be
and
visits
which
not
nice
for
a
young
lady
to
be
known
as
one
that
would
put
up
with
them
and
going
on
day
after
day
and
the
squire
not
here
nor
no
lady
companion
nor
even
a
servant
in
the
room
do
you
mean
said
clare
sharply
stopping
her
in
the
midst
of
this
harangue
mean
just
what
i
am
saying
miss
said
fillpot
in
her
excitement
not
nice
for
no
young
lady
a
thing
as
no
young
lady
should
do
miss
held
my
tongue
as
long
as
i
could
and
i
no
longer
write
to
master
miss
speak
to
arthur
i
must
do
something
not
so
much
as
a
maid
in
the
room
and
a
lady
in
the
house
and
him
coming
and
coming
i
will
say
of
arthur
as
i
thought
he
had
more
clare
had
chilled
and
hardened
into
stone
as
she
was
thus
addressed
a
deep
blush
had
covered
her
face
at
first
but
that
had
faded
leaving
her
more
pale
than
usual
and
her
blue
eyes
shot
glances
that
were
like
arrows
of
ice
into
the
good
heart
those
blue
eyes
which
were
sometimes
so
sweet
how
cold
how
blighting
how
withering
they
could
be
she
pointed
her
hand
to
the
door
before
she
could
speak
she
made
a
spasmodic
effort
to
retain
her
composure
and
dignity
precisely
what
you
please
she
said
do
not
let
me
see
you
clare
said
the
woman
miss
clare
your
good
i
am
thinking
of
what
could
i
want
but
your
good
me
that
has
nursed
you
and
loved
you
and
took
an
interest
away
please
said
clare
with
a
choked
voice
away
i
wish
to
see
you
miss
clare
you
see
i
am
occupied
you
see
good
heavens
are
you
a
woman
and
have
no
more
sense
than
to
stand
and
drive
me
frantic
there
miss
clare
have
no
more
to
say
to
you
go
please
said
clare
falling
back
into
her
seat
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
old
bureau
which
had
been
her
he
had
sat
there
a
thousand
times
bending
over
it
as
she
was
doing
now
would
he
have
been
any
aid
to
her
in
this
terrible
emergency
shame
too
as
well
as
everything
else
she
had
been
no
better
than
jeanie
less
maidenly
than
alice
pimpernel
she
had
cared
too
much
for
him
to
remember
the
maidenly
decorums
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
she
had
laid
herself
open
to
the
comments
of
this
woman
and
probably
of
every
servant
in
the
house
no
doubt
they
had
found
her
out
and
laughed
to
see
how
she
too
indulged
herself
when
her
own
feelings
were
touched
indifferent
to
all
proprieties
she
who
had
made
so
many
indignant
remonstrances
on
that
very
subject
and
so
often
bidden
the
village
girls
to
have
a
due
respect
for
themselves
she
sat
with
her
face
turned
away
pretending
to
search
among
the
drawers
of
the
bureau
while
fillpot
stood
explaining
and
protesting
behind
clare
did
not
even
know
when
the
housekeeper
retired
weeping
and
wondering
she
sat
absorbed
in
her
own
misery
drawing
to
herself
such
pictures
of
her
own
conduct
as
the
most
guilty
could
scarcely
have
exceeded
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
sat
opening
and
shutting
mechanically
the
drawers
of
the
bureau
idly
examining
without
seeing
what
she
was
doing
its
inner
corners
half
in
abstraction
half
in
determination
to
prove
to
herself
that
she
was
pursuing
the
researches
which
arthur
had
begged
her
not
to
pursue
she
had
opened
a
little
door
which
was
locked
and
which
shut
in
a
nest
of
smaller
drawers
which
had
not
as
yet
been
examined
it
was
these
she
was
now
playing
with
unconsciously
not
thinking
or
seeing
what
she
did
one
of
them
however
was
very
stiff
and
the
little
material
obstacle
roused
her
up
almost
against
her
will
she
pulled
at
it
in
her
confusion
of
mind
growing
angry
over
the
difficulty
was
everything
to
resist
her
even
such
a
thing
as
this
then
she
perceived
there
was
a
bundle
of
papers
within
which
kept
it
from
opening
clare
woke
up
and
took
pains
when
she
felt
herself
as
it
were
held
at
bay
she
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
over
it
and
at
last
succeeded
in
opening
the
drawer
that
was
all
she
wanted
her
interest
failed
as
soon
as
the
bundle
fell
out
it
was
a
packet
of
letters
enclosed
in
a
piece
of
paper
sealed
at
the
ends
and
endorsed
she
had
found
twenty
such
already
all
of
the
most
ordinary
description
letters
for
leases
about
the
this
was
the
sort
of
endorsing
she
had
generally
found
the
new
packet
doubtless
was
no
more
important
than
the
others
she
took
it
into
her
hand
and
threw
it
down
again
into
the
open
which
was
nearest
to
her
and
then
only
for
the
first
time
she
perceived
that
it
was
growing
dark
and
that
the
day
was
almost
over
the
shutters
had
never
been
opened
which
she
had
closed
in
the
morning
to
keep
out
the
sun
to
keep
out
the
sun
would
the
sunshine
ever
come
in
again
she
locked
up
the
bureau
slowly
and
went
wandering
out
not
knowing
where
she
went
sunshine
and
light
had
departed
from
arden
was
it
for
evermore
chapter
xvii
condemnation
of
her
cousin
was
of
course
unjust
he
had
not
done
anything
to
deserve
so
harsh
a
judgment
at
least
what
he
had
really
done
to
deserve
it
was
unknown
to
her
he
had
not
attempted
to
deceive
her
in
that
special
point
his
note
was
true
to
the
letter
the
fault
he
had
committed
was
but
of
two
duration
and
was
simply
the
result
of
a
sudden
temptation
which
probably
he
would
have
avoided
had
he
been
at
all
prepared
for
it
avoided
be
it
understood
not
out
of
any
distaste
for
the
pleasant
folly
but
for
prudential
motives
but
he
had
not
been
prepared
for
it
and
he
had
seen
a
pretty
defenceless
creature
in
his
way
poor
enough
and
of
sufficiently
small
consideration
to
have
violent
made
to
her
and
an
attempt
at
least
at
familiarity
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
opportunity
arthur
arden
would
not
have
ventured
to
address
jeanie
so
had
she
been
even
daughter
he
was
not
cowardly
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
but
there
was
so
much
of
the
craven
in
him
as
in
most
men
moved
by
similar
impulses
that
his
passions
were
only
irrestrainable
when
the
object
of
them
could
be
safely
assailed
even
with
all
this
and
allowing
that
could
he
have
done
it
he
would
have
tried
his
best
to
make
a
victim
of
jeanie
still
there
had
not
been
time
enough
nor
opportunity
enough
to
raise
any
such
purpose
seriously
in
his
mind
when
he
spoke
to
her
he
only
half
meant
or
perhaps
did
not
mean
at
all
what
he
said
it
was
mere
levity
and
spontaneous
instinctive
not
intentional
wickedness
how
far
this
would
have
mended
matters
with
a
really
just
critic
i
will
not
pretend
to
ask
but
it
would
have
mended
matters
with
clare
she
however
had
formed
a
very
different
opinion
of
the
whole
transaction
it
was
most
serious
and
full
of
elaborate
plan
and
purpose
in
her
eyes
the
basest
purpose
of
which
man
could
be
guilty
and
the
most
mortifying
to
herself
she
made
the
fact
which
perfitt
had
disclosed
to
her
into
a
whole
drama
of
evil
intention
she
did
not
know
in
what
her
kinsman
had
spent
the
morning
in
what
he
was
about
to
spend
the
afternoon
she
did
not
know
how
much
he
was
suffering
in
order
chiefly
to
prolong
his
stay
in
her
neighbourhood
it
is
true
that
his
other
sins
richly
deserved
the
condemnation
she
had
pronounced
he
was
employing
her
as
a
shield
while
he
attempted
to
do
the
greatest
possible
injury
to
her
brother
he
was
plotting
secretly
under
her
protection
and
in
her
very
shadow
against
the
honour
and
good
fame
of
the
family
and
even
against
herself
personally
for
her
own
fortune
was
involved
in
so
far
at
least
as
old
arden
was
concerned
for
all
this
she
could
have
better
pardoned
him
than
for
the
supposed
deception
he
had
just
practised
upon
her
thus
his
doom
was
just
but
it
was
not
given
on
just
grounds
but
it
happens
often
enough
as
many
women
could
testify
that
the
doom
pronounced
by
virtue
upon
vice
by
the
true
upon
the
false
bears
very
often
much
more
heavily
upon
the
judge
than
upon
the
condemned
the
culprit
bears
up
under
the
blow
while
she
who
sits
on
the
throne
of
justice
is
shaken
to
pieces
by
the
reverberation
clare
who
felt
herself
both
judge
and
executioner
in
one
and
whose
mind
was
full
of
wild
plans
of
vengeance
was
herself
at
the
same
time
the
immediate
victim
drearily
more
dreary
than
ever
before
the
day
closed
upon
her
leaving
her
all
alone
in
the
solitude
of
those
stately
rooms
dimly
lighted
and
all
so
silent
night
was
coming
night
which
if
it
brought
forgetfulness
would
be
her
best
comforter
but
it
seemed
utterly
impossible
that
it
could
bring
forgetfulness
or
that
sleep
should
ever
come
again
to
her
burning
weary
yet
wakeful
eyelids
she
could
not
read
she
could
not
work
she
could
think
but
of
one
subject
and
that
was
not
one
which
she
could
exercise
any
free
will
about
discussing
it
reasonably
with
herself
but
one
which
pursued
her
forcing
itself
into
supremacy
driving
her
thoughts
wildly
into
one
channel
whether
she
would
or
not
she
sat
by
the
table
with
her
head
supported
in
her
two
hands
and
gazed
into
the
white
flame
of
the
lamp
till
her
eyes
were
almost
scorched
while
a
thousand
wild
fancies
pursued
each
other
through
her
mind
the
moths
circled
about
and
about
the
light
and
so
did
her
thoughts
about
the
fatal
centre
which
they
had
formed
for
themselves
until
the
flimsy
suicides
wove
themselves
in
with
her
imaginations
and
became
somehow
a
part
of
her
and
them
she
had
not
energy
enough
left
to
save
them
is
another
she
would
say
to
herself
they
all
mad
i
wonder
they
feel
that
it
kills
them
i
wonder
where
he
is
now
oh
i
hope
he
is
beginning
to
feel
what
a
false
step
he
has
taken
there
is
many
a
woman
that
will
put
up
with
being
deceived
but
not
me
never
me
to
think
he
should
have
known
me
so
little
and
he
an
arden
i
wonder
what
edgar
will
say
when
he
knows
he
shall
never
know
i
hate
him
but
i
will
never
never
betray
to
any
one
and
yet
i
promised
i
would
interfere
i
said
it
should
never
occur
again
there
is
another
and
another
i
wonder
why
they
like
it
so
much
it
be
for
the
warmth
for
it
is
warm
everywhere
i
said
it
should
never
occur
again
i
was
a
fool
to
take
any
part
what
have
i
to
do
with
with
that
girl
she
is
not
even
a
village
girl
to
have
a
claim
upon
me
if
she
likes
to
be
ruined
and
shamed
that
is
not
my
affair
perhaps
she
thinks
he
loves
her
forsooth
oh
what
fools
what
fools
people
are
people
and
moths
the
lamp
is
choked
up
with
them
what
strange
strange
silly
creatures
i
stop
them
and
how
can
i
stop
her
and
why
should
i
it
is
her
business
it
is
not
mine
if
she
had
been
a
girl
in
the
village
but
then
i
said
it
should
not
occur
thus
clare
mused
and
as
the
slow
moments
went
on
her
musing
grew
into
a
kind
of
rhythm
of
broken
fancies
all
bound
together
by
the
continued
burden
said
it
should
not
occur
it
was
like
a
song
which
she
thus
murmured
to
herself
or
rather
which
murmured
in
her
ears
without
any
will
of
hers
rising
and
falling
with
its
refrain
said
it
should
not
occur
at
length
the
refrain
gained
upon
the
rest
and
repeated
and
repeated
itself
till
her
brain
grew
dizzy
at
all
events
she
had
to
keep
her
word
and
what
should
she
do
should
she
interpose
authoritatively
as
was
her
right
as
the
natural
protectress
of
every
girl
in
arden
should
she
write
to
him
herself
and
warn
him
that
his
evil
designs
were
known
and
she
the
champion
and
shield
of
her
maidens
in
arms
against
him
should
she
act
imperiously
and
with
a
high
hand
by
sending
jeanie
and
her
grandmother
out
of
her
territory
she
was
so
used
to
think
as
well
as
act
that
neither
of
those
plans
seemed
quite
impracticable
to
clare
they
were
on
the
contrary
quite
natural
things
which
had
she
been
less
concerned
she
would
not
have
hesitated
to
do
but
alas
she
was
intimately
concerned
and
her
arm
seemed
paralysed
she
gave
forth
the
sentence
without
hesitation
but
as
for
the
manner
of
executing
it
she
seemed
only
capable
of
thrusting
the
sword
into
herself
then
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
as
it
came
to
her
all
at
once
so
she
executed
it
all
at
once
with
the
impatient
and
irritable
haste
of
suffering
half
the
mad
things
that
people
do
when
they
are
in
trouble
are
done
in
this
way
their
brain
grows
dizzy
over
plans
and
impossible
conceptions
and
then
a
sudden
suggestion
comes
across
them
and
they
obey
it
on
the
moment
she
started
up
and
brought
her
from
the
where
it
was
to
the
ring
of
light
round
the
lamp
and
she
wrote
the
following
note
hastily
without
even
pausing
to
draw
breath
mr
fielding
i
have
just
heard
to
my
great
pain
that
your
little
friend
jeanie
has
been
annoyed
by
my
cousin
arthur
arden
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
my
direct
interference
which
i
need
not
explain
one
ought
to
be
above
all
secondary
motives
but
unfortunately
one
is
not
i
do
not
know
who
is
most
to
blame
if
she
has
been
trying
to
attract
him
thinking
perhaps
he
was
less
experienced
in
such
matters
than
he
is
or
if
it
is
entirely
his
fault
he
is
staying
at
the
red
house
with
the
pimpernels
which
of
itself
of
course
is
a
reason
why
i
do
not
desire
to
have
more
intercourse
with
him
than
i
can
help
and
of
course
this
affair
is
a
double
reason
i
do
not
advise
you
to
communicate
with
him
for
gentlemen
i
believe
do
not
like
to
be
called
to
account
for
their
actions
but
i
think
you
should
do
something
at
once
in
respect
to
the
girl
you
might
put
her
on
her
guard
that
he
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
man
to
be
made
a
victim
of
or
taken
in
in
any
way
he
must
either
be
simply
amusing
himself
or
his
object
can
not
be
a
good
one
i
speak
freely
because
you
know
i
have
always
felt
that
in
my
position
false
delicacy
would
be
a
crime
i
have
always
considered
myself
responsible
for
the
girls
in
the
village
and
my
motive
is
i
think
quite
enough
to
justify
me
i
think
if
i
were
in
your
place
not
being
able
to
act
in
my
own
that
i
should
have
the
girl
removed
at
once
from
arden
there
seems
no
reason
why
she
and
her
grandmother
should
have
chosen
this
place
to
live
in
and
there
is
nothing
particular
that
ever
i
heard
of
in
arden
air
any
other
fresh
country
air
would
no
doubt
do
quite
as
well
should
be
glad
if
you
would
let
me
know
what
you
do
and
as
soon
as
possible
edgar
being
away
makes
one
feel
it
all
the
more
affectionately
poor
clare
she
wrote
this
at
a
stretch
scarcely
lifting
her
head
from
the
paper
with
a
philosophy
which
surprised
herself
and
which
was
not
in
the
least
philosophy
but
only
the
very
highest
strain
of
excitement
but
she
could
not
help
hanging
up
that
one
little
flag
of
distress
at
the
end
being
away
makes
one
feel
it
all
the
she
had
not
said
a
word
about
feeling
it
till
then
but
now
her
head
fell
upon
her
clasped
hands
and
she
wept
a
few
very
bitter
very
scalding
tears
hiding
them
even
from
herself
so
to
speak
in
the
handkerchief
which
she
crushed
against
her
hot
scorched
eyes
and
then
she
rose
up
and
put
her
note
in
an
envelope
and
sent
it
off
for
it
was
only
about
nine
still
though
it
felt
to
clare
as
if
it
must
have
been
the
middle
of
the
night
immediately
after
she
went
upstairs
and
went
to
bed
to
the
great
amazement
of
her
maid
for
clare
did
not
usually
keep
early
hours
she
wanted
the
darkness
the
stillness
the
quiet
she
said
to
herself
but
the
fact
was
she
wanted
a
change
anything
that
would
be
different
from
what
she
had
been
before
doing
she
could
not
sleep
of
course
and
when
she
had
borne
that
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
bear
it
she
got
up
and
partially
dressed
herself
and
went
down
in
her
to
the
library
to
see
if
some
novelty
or
distraction
could
be
found
there
by
this
time
the
whole
house
was
asleep
dark
motionless
and
silent
like
a
house
of
the
dead
her
candle
was
ghostly
beyond
description
in
the
great
dim
library
it
even
occurred
to
mind
as
a
kind
of
hope
that
she
might
see
something
unearthly
and
thus
be
driven
legitimately
mad
and
a
reason
given
to
herself
and
others
for
the
change
in
her
which
no
doubt
others
would
see
but
nothing
unearthly
was
to
be
seen
nothing
but
a
vast
expanse
of
darkness
her
chair
standing
by
the
table
the
walls
clothed
with
books
glimmering
faintly
in
the
corner
nearest
the
light
from
out
the
tarnished
brass
of
the
which
enclosed
them
nothing
to
see
nothing
to
hear
nothing
but
herself
the
one
thing
of
which
no
change
could
rid
her
clare
sat
down
at
the
bureau
in
her
misery
and
opened
it
with
the
key
which
she
had
left
in
it
the
little
inner
door
which
she
had
unlocked
in
the
morning
and
which
now
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
she
had
never
seen
unlocked
before
swung
in
her
face
as
she
opened
the
outer
enclosure
in
mere
sickness
of
heart
she
thrust
her
hand
into
the
corner
where
that
afternoon
she
had
thrown
the
bundle
of
letters
which
had
prevented
one
of
the
drawers
from
opening
indifferently
she
had
thrown
it
down
indifferently
she
took
it
up
one
end
of
it
was
singed
and
brown
as
if
it
had
been
thrown
into
the
fire
and
the
outside
corner
was
slightly
torn
with
a
black
mark
on
it
of
something
by
which
it
had
evidently
been
fished
out
again
letters
which
her
father
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
burn
and
then
had
repented
this
did
her
a
little
good
a
languid
interest
too
languid
almost
to
be
called
interest
came
into
her
mind
a
faint
wonder
breathed
across
her
why
he
who
burned
nothing
should
have
thought
of
burning
that
she
turned
it
over
indifferently
to
read
the
endorsing
and
even
after
she
had
read
it
it
was
some
time
before
the
words
produced
any
effect
upon
mind
concerning
the
papers
concerning
the
boy
is
the
boy
what
does
it
mean
she
said
to
herself
then
she
came
as
it
were
to
life
as
she
gazed
at
it
through
the
broken
envelope
two
or
three
words
caught
her
eye
she
raised
herself
quite
upright
seized
it
tremulously
and
put
her
hand
upon
the
seals
but
even
while
she
did
so
her
mind
changed
instead
of
breaking
open
the
packet
she
snatched
up
another
piece
of
paper
and
hastily
it
then
taking
her
handkerchief
which
was
the
first
thing
she
could
find
tied
it
round
the
parcel
then
she
sat
for
half
the
night
stupefied
with
a
new
subject
for
her
thoughts
chapter
xviii
proceedings
next
day
were
the
cause
of
absolute
consternation
to
everybody
concerned
in
the
morning
she
was
very
restless
roaming
about
from
floor
to
floor
from
the
library
to
the
dining
room
and
then
to
her
carrying
with
her
something
tied
up
in
her
handkerchief
i
carry
it
for
you
miss
arden
her
maid
had
asked
meeting
her
suddenly
on
the
stair
it
what
clare
had
answered
sharply
dropping
her
hand
with
the
little
bundle
in
it
among
the
folds
of
her
dress
had
it
been
perceived
how
often
she
changed
the
place
in
which
she
had
this
parcel
locked
up
the
wonder
of
the
household
would
have
been
still
further
roused
she
had
sat
up
half
the
night
at
least
doing
nothing
staring
into
the
candle
and
when
finally
she
went
up
stairs
she
had
carried
her
mysterious
bundle
with
her
placing
it
under
her
pillow
when
she
came
down
weary
and
pale
in
the
morning
she
had
carried
it
to
the
library
and
locked
it
into
the
bureau
then
prompted
by
some
sudden
change
of
mind
she
had
transferred
it
from
the
bureau
to
a
drawer
in
the
writing
table
in
the
morning
room
where
she
chiefly
sat
then
she
carried
it
off
to
her
wardrobe
and
finally
about
noon
restored
it
to
its
original
place
in
the
bureau
she
put
it
back
into
its
own
original
drawer
which
would
scarcely
contain
it
locked
the
inner
door
and
hung
the
key
round
her
neck
on
a
ribbon
and
then
locking
the
outer
part
of
the
bureau
shut
up
the
key
of
that
in
her
desk
she
was
very
pale
and
yet
now
and
then
would
grow
hot
and
flushed
without
any
reason
she
employed
herself
all
the
morning
in
feverish
movement
from
one
place
to
another
at
twelve
she
called
her
maid
barbara
and
told
her
to
make
ready
to
go
out
am
going
up
to
the
three
beeches
she
said
something
with
you
to
eat
for
it
may
be
late
before
we
get
home
i
take
any
luncheon
for
you
miss
arden
said
the
girl
shall
i
order
the
carriage
want
anything
to
eat
and
i
prefer
to
walk
clare
said
abruptly
and
accordingly
at
twelve
of
a
blazing
summer
morning
she
set
out
for
a
three
walk
attended
by
her
unwilling
maid
with
a
parcel
of
books
any
one
calls
you
can
say
i
have
gone
out
for
the
day
she
said
to
wilkins
who
was
no
less
amazed
she
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
from
the
house
when
barbara
interrupted
her
progress
miss
arden
i
see
the
rector
coming
up
the
mind
said
clare
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
hurried
on
the
rector
had
come
up
in
a
state
of
great
trouble
and
excitement
first
to
remonstrate
with
clare
for
her
injurious
suspicions
in
regard
to
poor
little
jeanie
secondly
to
warn
herself
against
arthur
arden
and
thirdly
to
ask
her
advice
what
he
should
say
to
murray
on
the
subject
which
was
a
part
of
the
business
which
frightened
him
much
he
was
not
an
early
man
at
any
time
and
note
had
much
discomposed
him
and
the
parish
business
had
taken
him
up
for
at
least
an
hour
when
he
was
turned
back
from
the
door
of
arden
his
astonishment
knew
no
bounds
out
he
said
out
for
the
day
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
wilkins
has
she
gone
to
pay
a
visit
but
i
did
not
meet
her
in
the
avenue
and
she
has
not
passed
through
the
village
this
morning
so
far
as
i
could
sir
she
has
not
gone
upon
a
visit
said
wilkins
about
somewhere
in
the
park
i
do
believe
not
as
i
knows
that
my
own
knowledge
he
added
hurriedly
clare
may
have
gone
bless
you
she
might
have
gone
anywhere
to
lady
maybe
only
all
away
or
to
miss
or
to
the
village
miss
clare
is
the
independentest
young
lady
as
you
know
yes
she
may
be
independent
but
she
does
not
rush
out
like
this
without
any
reason
has
she
had
any
letters
about
business
anything
to
call
her
abroad
know
sir
no
more
than
adam
said
wilkins
shaking
his
head
and
then
he
sank
into
mystery
step
in
for
a
moment
sir
call
fillpot
i
think
like
to
say
a
word
and
she
has
a
kind
of
a
notion
she
knows
mr
fielding
went
into
the
hall
shaking
his
head
and
then
he
passed
into
morning
room
where
everything
was
painfully
tidy
and
there
was
no
appearance
of
any
occupation
about
the
rector
shook
his
head
still
as
he
peered
into
the
corners
with
his
eyes
has
taken
it
to
heart
she
has
taken
it
to
heart
he
said
to
himself
and
shook
his
head
more
and
more
then
fillpot
came
in
with
a
white
apron
the
corner
of
which
she
held
in
one
hand
ready
for
instant
action
wilkins
lingered
near
the
door
with
the
view
of
being
one
of
the
party
but
the
rector
promptly
closed
it
upon
him
have
something
to
tell
me
from
miss
clare
he
said
for
to
be
sure
he
was
jealous
of
being
thought
to
come
and
ask
questions
of
the
servants
at
the
hall
from
miss
clare
sir
worse
luck
said
fillpot
i
come
to
tell
you
to
do
with
her
this
morning
arthur
sir
has
been
day
after
day
been
here
has
arthur
since
last
monday
every
afternoon
of
his
life
and
miss
clare
and
he
in
the
library
as
none
of
us
likes
to
go
in
no
more
nor
we
can
help
with
their
papers
hurt
me
to
see
it
mr
fielding
like
as
if
she
had
been
my
own
child
a
young
lady
and
no
mother
and
the
squire
away
as
should
take
care
of
his
sister
so
i
up
and
told
her
yesterday
it
took
a
deal
of
screwing
up
to
give
me
the
courage
but
bless
you
sir
if
a
woman
that
courage
for
one
as
brought
up
so
i
up
and
told
her
i
said
right
miss
and
it
nice
nor
what
your
poor
dear
mamma
if
have
lived
would
have
i
said
it
plain
out
as
saying
it
to
you
though
i
was
all
of
a
tremble
bless
you
thinking
of
it
all
of
a
tremble
what
did
she
say
asked
mr
fielding
say
much
sir
miss
clare
was
never
one
to
say
much
she
waved
me
to
go
and
i
went
without
even
a
you
fillpot
or
know
you
means
well
nor
nothing
but
when
barbara
came
to
me
this
morning
asking
for
a
bit
of
lunch
and
saying
as
her
young
lady
was
out
to
spend
the
day
bless
you
i
saw
it
all
in
a
moment
she
say
nothing
but
acted
upon
it
has
miss
did
nothing
else
happen
besides
what
you
tell
me
said
mr
fielding
still
shaking
his
head
as
i
can
think
on
well
arthur
he
come
yesterday
and
perfitt
he
brought
a
bit
of
a
letter
and
he
went
in
and
saw
her
for
five
minutes
or
so
did
perfitt
but
perfitt
saw
her
did
he
said
the
rector
sir
but
i
see
what
difference
that
could
make
said
fillpot
jealous
of
her
power
no
i
suppose
so
said
mr
fielding
but
in
his
mind
he
allowed
that
it
might
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
and
went
away
very
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
has
taken
it
to
heart
poor
child
she
has
taken
it
to
heart
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
home
shaking
his
head
with
that
mingled
pity
and
sense
of
superiority
which
an
affectionate
bystander
feels
in
such
a
case
better
that
she
should
suffer
a
little
now
than
afterwards
when
it
would
be
too
late
was
thought
and
in
his
aged
mind
this
a
was
all
that
was
comprehensible
of
passion
and
agony
she
would
get
over
it
after
a
while
of
course
and
no
particular
harm
would
be
done
such
was
his
conception
of
the
state
of
affairs
there
was
however
another
visitor
to
arden
whose
consternation
was
still
greater
arthur
came
at
his
usual
hour
in
the
afternoon
with
all
his
energies
refreshed
by
his
temporary
absence
and
with
a
determination
in
his
mind
to
know
his
fate
at
once
so
far
as
clare
was
concerned
he
loved
her
he
said
to
himself
it
was
true
that
he
was
quite
capable
of
being
momentarily
drawn
aside
from
his
allegiance
and
that
his
recent
pursuit
of
her
had
been
complicated
by
other
motives
but
yet
he
loved
her
if
edgar
were
unmasked
and
himself
in
place
it
would
still
be
his
cousin
clare
whom
he
would
prefer
to
all
others
to
sit
upon
his
throne
with
him
and
why
should
he
delay
speaking
to
her
on
the
subject
if
things
remained
as
they
were
which
was
probable
then
she
would
share
what
she
had
with
him
and
if
he
could
make
any
discovery
and
better
his
own
position
why
then
of
course
he
would
share
everything
with
her
you
are
not
the
heiress
born
and
i
he
said
the
lawful
heir
we
two
will
wed
morn
and
you
shall
still
be
lady
this
rhyme
ran
in
his
head
as
he
went
up
the
avenue
with
many
a
softer
thought
he
had
made
himself
very
agreeable
to
alice
pimpernel
the
day
before
so
much
so
as
to
leave
little
doubt
on
her
mind
as
to
what
would
follow
anything
came
of
that
arden
business
and
he
had
shown
an
inclination
to
make
himself
more
than
agreeable
to
jeanie
but
neither
of
them
so
much
as
touched
his
determination
if
it
were
possible
to
wed
clare
arden
whatever
might
happen
accordingly
he
went
with
his
mind
made
up
to
see
her
and
open
his
heart
and
there
was
so
much
natural
feeling
in
the
matter
that
he
was
more
excited
by
it
than
he
had
been
for
years
really
it
was
something
which
he
could
with
justice
call
his
happiness
which
was
involved
it
would
make
the
most
material
difference
to
him
if
she
refused
him
he
felt
that
he
might
return
to
the
red
house
an
altered
man
either
happy
and
serene
or
discouraged
beyond
all
conception
he
feared
a
little
because
he
was
in
earnest
but
he
hoped
a
great
deal
more
than
he
feared
these
days
of
uninterrupted
intercourse
had
been
much
in
his
favour
he
felt
he
had
done
everything
he
could
to
gain
his
confidence
he
had
refrained
from
in
any
of
its
distincter
fashions
he
had
shown
himself
anxious
for
her
approval
conscious
of
the
improprieties
of
his
past
life
in
short
he
knew
he
had
made
progress
and
now
with
a
thrill
of
excitement
he
came
to
seek
his
fate
he
said
blankly
stricken
dumb
with
amazement
and
gazing
at
wilkins
as
if
he
had
been
a
prodigy
and
then
he
recovered
himself
out
in
the
garden
i
suppose
he
added
so
good
as
to
let
miss
arden
know
that
i
am
here
and
ask
if
i
may
join
is
not
in
the
garden
said
wilkins
with
a
solemn
enjoyment
of
the
disappointment
arthur
arden
was
not
liked
by
the
servants
and
wilkins
lingered
over
every
word
by
way
of
tantalising
him
more
arden
has
gone
out
sir
for
the
day
for
the
day
them
were
her
very
words
she
says
any
one
calls
i
have
gone
out
for
the
nothing
sir
could
be
more
exact
than
miss
arden
arthur
was
so
completely
taken
aback
that
he
stood
aghast
for
a
moment
gazing
at
the
man
who
confronted
him
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
on
his
face
blocking
up
the
door
wilkins
stood
like
one
who
felt
his
own
supremacy
in
an
easy
attitude
upon
the
threshold
forbidding
all
comers
as
effectually
as
if
he
had
been
a
squadron
of
cavalry
were
the
very
words
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
and
arthur
stood
below
expelled
as
it
were
from
paradise
the
catastrophe
was
so
sudden
and
so
unlooked
for
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
meet
it
he
could
not
even
for
the
moment
hide
his
own
discomfiture
and
dismay
suppose
miss
arden
intends
me
to
go
on
with
my
work
and
await
her
coming
he
said
at
length
am
very
sorry
to
miss
her
but
i
suppose
that
is
what
i
must
say
nothing
about
it
sir
said
wilkins
what
is
more
been
and
locked
the
library
then
arthur
perceived
that
things
were
really
going
against
him
he
would
not
betray
himself
to
the
eyes
i
suppose
something
must
have
happened
he
said
with
as
light
a
tone
as
he
could
summon
up
miss
arden
i
was
very
sorry
to
find
her
gone
i
suppose
she
has
changed
her
mind
about
the
papers
tell
her
if
she
wishes
me
to
go
on
with
them
that
she
must
send
me
word
to
the
red
house
i
shall
be
there
for
some
days
longer
i
shall
pay
my
respects
to
her
whether
i
hear
from
her
or
not
before
i
leave
but
if
i
am
to
do
any
more
work
ask
her
to
let
me
give
her
your
message
sir
said
wilkins
with
satisfaction
and
then
before
he
was
conscious
what
it
meant
before
he
could
half
realise
the
position
arthur
found
himself
with
his
back
to
the
house
making
his
way
once
more
down
the
avenue
could
it
be
possible
was
he
dreaming
he
was
so
completely
taken
by
surprise
that
he
had
lost
all
his
readiness
of
reason
and
promptitude
in
an
emergency
nothing
so
overwhelming
so
sudden
so
mysterious
had
ever
happened
to
him
before
it
was
not
only
a
disappointment
it
was
an
insult
dismissed
by
a
servant
turned
away
from
the
door
which
it
might
be
was
legally
his
sent
off
without
a
word
of
explanation
arthur
paused
when
he
had
gone
down
the
avenue
to
say
to
himself
that
he
must
be
dreaming
that
he
must
go
back
and
laugh
at
the
hoax
that
had
been
played
upon
him
and
find
clare
in
the
full
satisfaction
of
a
successful
trick
laughing
too
but
then
there
came
in
the
chill
thought
that
clare
was
not
at
all
the
sort
of
person
to
perform
a
trick
of
any
kind
and
that
what
she
did
was
generally
in
deadly
earnest
relieved
by
no
practical
jokes
his
amazement
was
so
profound
that
he
scarcely
said
a
word
to
himself
all
the
way
down
had
she
found
out
anything
was
there
anything
to
find
out
his
meaning
in
that
raid
upon
the
papers
was
known
to
no
one
but
himself
nobody
could
say
a
word
against
his
motives
nobody
could
be
offended
with
him
because
he
had
a
zeal
for
his
family
to
write
a
book
about
them
even
was
a
perfectly
justifiable
not
to
say
laudable
idea
what
could
she
have
had
to
find
fault
with
arthur
was
as
much
surprised
as
dismayed
he
went
home
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
beaten
corporeally
as
well
as
mentally
feeling
more
absolutely
small
and
mean
and
contemptible
than
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
humiliated
before
wilkins
even
made
the
of
the
servants
this
was
the
manner
in
which
he
was
sent
away
from
arden
on
the
day
which
he
had
selected
to
decide
his
fate
chapter
xix
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
make
a
sudden
and
rapid
decision
which
is
one
says
to
self
final
and
settles
in
a
moment
some
great
question
which
affects
a
whole
existence
as
soon
as
the
uncertainty
is
over
and
the
decision
absolutely
made
everything
will
come
easy
the
sufferer
thinks
and
such
had
been
feeling
when
she
set
out
upon
that
wretched
ramble
with
barbara
toiling
after
her
she
would
cut
herself
off
at
once
and
for
ever
from
all
possibility
of
being
remonstrated
with
talked
over
moved
by
any
argument
she
would
cut
the
knot
by
one
arbitrary
action
and
free
herself
and
when
that
was
once
successfully
done
she
could
live
without
sympathy
without
any
desire
to
cast
herself
upon
the
aid
of
others
she
would
be
all
the
rest
of
her
life
had
not
she
already
tried
every
relationship
and
found
it
wanting
he
who
had
made
himself
most
dear
to
her
he
who
had
pretended
to
love
her
had
deceived
her
every
friend
she
had
in
all
probability
would
disapprove
of
the
encouragement
she
had
given
to
arthur
and
would
equally
disapprove
of
the
summary
and
insulting
way
in
which
she
had
cast
him
off
her
father
whole
being
surged
up
into
excitement
as
she
thought
of
him
excitement
produced
by
two
words
which
she
had
spied
through
a
torn
envelope
and
which
perhaps
meant
nothing
in
the
world
her
brother
heart
sank
again
into
a
sickness
and
miserable
failing
of
all
strength
and
composure
she
was
alone
absolutely
alone
on
the
face
of
the
earth
she
had
no
one
to
fall
back
upon
to
consult
on
such
a
terrible
dilemma
as
never
surely
woman
was
placed
in
before
walking
under
that
blazing
sun
was
fortunately
of
itself
confusing
and
exhausting
enough
but
when
she
reached
the
three
beeches
and
sat
down
under
their
shadow
all
the
excitement
in
her
mind
seemed
to
meet
and
clash
filling
up
her
brain
with
a
buzz
and
sound
which
almost
drove
her
mad
not
one
great
battle
only
but
two
or
three
were
raging
within
her
exploding
now
from
one
quarter
now
from
another
like
a
network
of
storms
the
three
beeches
stood
upon
an
elevated
point
not
very
high
in
itself
but
possessing
all
the
importance
of
a
hill
in
that
level
country
the
trees
were
very
fine
old
trees
with
great
gnarled
trunks
and
such
a
wealth
of
shadow
under
them
as
made
the
traveller
rejoice
seated
on
the
thick
mossy
turf
clare
looked
down
and
saw
her
home
among
its
trees
and
the
bright
white
street
of
the
village
and
the
red
house
burning
in
the
sunshine
even
thornleigh
church
which
was
seven
miles
off
was
visible
in
the
sunny
distance
almost
every
individual
involved
in
the
dim
and
confused
drama
which
was
weaving
itself
about
her
was
at
present
could
she
but
see
under
those
roofs
within
her
range
of
vision
she
let
her
books
which
she
had
brought
with
the
intention
of
working
hard
at
a
translation
and
thus
making
thought
impossible
lie
beside
her
without
so
much
as
remembering
their
existence
thinking
how
could
she
help
thinking
as
long
as
there
is
nothing
particular
in
your
mind
it
is
of
course
easy
enough
to
occupy
it
with
external
matters
but
when
it
is
full
full
to
overflowing
so
clare
thought
and
thought
till
her
mind
felt
on
the
eve
of
giving
way
arthur
arden
had
done
her
a
great
wrong
she
thought
he
had
done
her
such
a
wrong
as
a
woman
can
never
forgive
to
a
man
not
only
preferred
another
to
her
but
made
false
pretences
of
love
to
her
in
order
to
enjoy
that
society
injury
and
contempt
could
go
no
further
he
had
wounded
her
heart
and
struck
a
deadly
blow
at
her
maidenly
dignity
and
pride
it
was
the
bitterest
wrong
and
as
such
she
had
resented
it
and
yet
perhaps
arthur
arden
had
been
wronged
as
bitterly
perhaps
he
had
unconsciously
suffered
all
his
life
and
providence
had
thrown
the
means
of
avenging
him
into
her
hands
edgar
too
had
been
wronged
not
in
the
same
way
but
by
being
made
an
instrument
of
injury
but
from
the
thought
of
edgar
she
shrank
as
if
it
hurt
her
and
her
father
whom
she
had
held
in
such
reverence
whom
she
had
worshipped
as
the
very
embodiment
of
all
the
ardens
whom
she
had
loved
so
much
and
who
had
loved
her
clare
shrank
as
if
a
shower
of
blows
were
hailing
upon
her
head
she
had
thrust
herself
into
his
secrets
and
now
she
must
bear
the
burden
if
she
had
pried
over
his
shoulder
while
he
was
living
how
poor
how
dishonourable
she
would
have
felt
herself
but
she
had
done
worse
than
that
she
had
stolen
a
surreptitious
glance
at
his
secrets
after
he
was
dead
then
she
tried
to
calm
herself
down
perhaps
the
words
she
had
read
did
not
mean
what
they
seemed
to
mean
perhaps
they
referred
to
something
perfectly
innocent
some
piece
of
generosity
on
her
part
of
which
he
had
said
nothing
to
any
one
but
clare
felt
that
even
were
this
the
case
she
must
bear
the
penalty
of
her
prying
she
dared
not
examine
further
her
which
perhaps
was
no
secret
must
be
the
burden
of
her
existence
never
would
she
breathe
it
to
any
one
never
allow
she
knew
it
never
never
escape
from
its
burning
presence
if
there
was
wrong
involved
she
must
allow
that
wrong
to
go
on
she
must
not
even
permit
herself
to
see
or
approach
the
man
who
was
the
sufferer
and
then
all
at
once
in
the
midst
of
her
rage
and
indignation
against
him
and
while
she
still
felt
that
no
punishment
was
too
great
to
requite
his
treachery
there
suddenly
came
upon
poor
clare
in
her
inexperience
and
ignorance
a
fit
of
such
yearning
for
him
as
rent
her
very
heart
what
with
her
injury
so
fresh
with
all
that
anger
and
bitterness
in
her
mind
dismayed
bewildered
torn
asunder
she
thus
found
out
that
love
will
not
go
out
of
the
heart
at
any
formal
bidding
it
turned
and
rent
her
like
the
demon
convulsing
her
very
soul
with
pain
she
opened
her
heavy
eyes
after
the
struggle
with
a
despairing
amazement
in
them
could
it
be
was
her
judgment
to
go
for
nothing
and
the
bitter
wound
which
he
had
inflicted
to
be
no
argument
against
him
nothing
but
this
sudden
appalling
experience
could
have
convinced
her
she
felt
so
weak
and
miserable
that
she
dropped
her
face
into
her
hands
and
wept
she
who
had
been
so
indignant
and
so
strong
arden
afraid
feeling
poorly
said
barbara
now
a
dear
young
lady
take
this
glass
of
wine
i
made
fillpot
give
it
me
for
you
and
kept
it
cool
in
the
bottom
of
the
basket
do
miss
a
want
anything
barbara
said
clare
and
in
the
greatness
of
her
misery
she
who
had
made
up
her
mind
for
the
rest
of
her
life
to
be
to
hide
her
secret
in
the
depths
of
her
being
and
ask
no
one
for
sympathy
had
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
to
keep
from
throwing
her
arms
round
neck
and
weeping
on
her
breast
she
restrained
the
impulse
however
and
kept
her
head
away
and
preserved
her
pride
for
the
moment
this
was
alas
how
her
heart
treated
clare
after
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
one
decision
was
all
that
was
necessary
she
made
her
decision
expecting
henceforward
everlasting
sadness
but
calm
whereas
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
prey
to
shock
after
shock
her
heart
melting
her
resolution
giving
way
a
hundred
struggles
going
on
within
her
her
very
determination
made
everything
worse
instead
of
better
you
had
not
thrust
everybody
from
you
if
you
had
not
condemned
unheard
if
you
had
not
come
away
and
insulted
and
abandoned
him
all
might
yet
have
been
well
said
the
traitor
within
and
thus
poor
clare
waded
in
the
very
deepest
of
waters
all
that
long
miserable
day
it
was
nightfall
when
she
returned
to
the
house
time
had
gone
imperceptibly
as
it
goes
when
there
is
nothing
tangible
in
it
long
threads
of
reverie
linked
themselves
into
each
other
going
on
and
on
as
if
they
need
never
end
and
coming
back
after
all
manner
of
digressions
to
the
same
central
subject
you
think
time
to
be
going
miss
the
maid
would
say
timidly
from
time
to
time
clare
would
reply
hopelessly
opening
or
shutting
the
book
she
had
taken
into
her
hands
but
at
length
the
sun
began
to
sink
and
it
was
evident
they
must
begin
their
walk
if
they
were
to
reach
arden
before
night
clare
swallowed
glass
of
wine
and
then
set
out
upon
the
weary
way
has
been
a
nice
quiet
day
she
said
mechanically
fibbing
with
the
instinct
of
good
society
as
she
got
up
hope
it
has
done
you
good
miss
said
barbara
doubtfully
all
the
good
in
the
world
said
clare
and
with
this
forlorn
fiction
she
walked
home
again
so
much
less
sure
of
her
own
constancy
so
much
more
doubtful
of
the
possibility
of
shutting
up
secrets
in
a
silence
as
of
the
grave
and
living
a
perpetual
life
of
sacrifice
without
hope
or
call
for
sympathy
than
she
had
been
in
the
morning
she
was
very
weary
when
she
got
home
weary
in
body
and
mind
and
could
only
answer
with
a
faint
smile
to
the
message
which
wilkins
gave
her
from
her
cousin
jeanie
had
not
kept
him
back
only
one
day
had
he
been
kept
back
by
all
the
united
influences
which
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
had
not
she
been
hard
upon
him
sending
him
summarily
away
from
her
for
one
offence
he
who
perhaps
all
his
life
had
been
wronged
so
bitterly
had
he
been
wronged
or
was
it
a
dream
and
had
he
wronged
her
or
was
this
but
a
cloud
that
might
pass
away
when
clare
had
got
rid
of
the
servants
who
worried
her
and
had
also
got
rid
of
the
poor
pretence
of
dining
which
she
went
through
in
order
not
to
reveal
to
them
too
clearly
the
commotion
in
her
mind
she
had
another
struggle
with
herself
whether
he
had
wronged
her
or
had
been
wronged
surely
it
was
best
now
to
keep
him
at
length
better
not
to
see
him
again
never
to
attempt
to
lean
her
cares
upon
him
to
confide
her
difficulties
to
him
oh
no
no
he
must
never
come
again
and
clare
said
to
herself
that
she
must
live
and
die
alone
when
the
servants
had
gone
to
bed
she
went
into
the
library
once
more
in
her
with
her
candle
and
unlocked
all
its
fastenings
and
took
out
the
bundle
of
papers
to
look
at
it
the
words
she
had
seen
which
had
woke
her
out
of
one
dream
of
pain
into
another
and
which
had
shaken
her
being
so
profoundly
were
covered
over
now
by
the
envelope
into
which
she
had
thrust
them
she
took
it
out
and
weighed
it
in
her
hands
the
neat
harmless
little
packet
which
looked
as
if
it
could
harm
nobody
what
right
had
she
to
think
it
would
harm
any
one
clare
took
it
out
as
if
it
had
been
something
explosive
and
weighed
it
and
gazed
at
it
all
the
house
was
silent
there
was
not
one
creature
in
it
who
was
not
sleeping
or
seeking
sleep
her
own
light
and
the
dim
one
which
awaited
her
in
her
chamber
upstairs
were
the
only
signs
of
life
in
the
great
silent
place
it
was
guarded
without
from
every
kind
of
assault
but
who
could
ward
off
the
enemies
who
existed
insidious
within
clare
sat
revolving
this
problem
until
the
night
was
far
gone
she
did
not
seem
able
to
leave
it
and
yet
her
thoughts
made
no
progress
was
she
the
guardian
of
arden
watching
over
that
secret
unable
to
give
it
up
keeping
the
house
and
the
family
from
harm
she
thought
it
was
some
demon
which
kept
tempting
her
to
open
the
packet
and
discover
all
most
likely
it
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
most
likely
what
she
would
find
out
on
a
closer
examination
would
altogether
clear
up
those
words
which
had
thrilled
her
through
and
through
as
with
an
electric
touch
they
were
her
papers
was
it
not
her
duty
to
find
out
what
was
in
them
to
be
ready
to
vindicate
her
memory
should
anyone
ever
assail
it
she
sat
and
weighed
the
papers
in
her
hand
and
listened
to
all
the
mysterious
sounds
and
mutterings
of
the
night
till
at
last
her
mind
became
incapable
of
any
personal
action
and
she
felt
it
grow
into
a
furious
of
the
two
opinions
which
charged
and
encountered
and
were
repulsed
and
rallied
again
and
tore
her
in
sunder
it
was
more
weariness
than
anything
else
which
prompted
her
at
last
to
the
step
she
took
she
was
reluctant
to
think
of
edgar
at
all
in
the
present
state
of
her
mind
and
yet
it
was
he
who
was
most
deeply
concerned
after
she
had
discussed
it
with
herself
for
hours
she
rose
up
from
the
bureau
at
the
bidding
of
a
sudden
impulse
and
sat
down
in
her
chair
it
was
a
chair
which
nobody
ever
occupied
which
the
servants
were
afraid
of
and
clare
could
not
but
feel
with
involuntary
superstition
that
her
father
himself
was
somehow
superintending
this
action
of
hers
she
drew
towards
her
the
blotting
book
he
had
used
and
which
contained
his
paper
paper
which
no
one
had
made
any
use
of
since
his
death
was
it
he
who
was
dictating
to
her
holding
her
pen
guiding
her
in
this
tardy
justice
her
letter
was
very
short
concise
and
restrained
before
she
began
to
write
she
did
not
feel
as
if
she
could
address
him
again
or
could
know
what
to
say
but
old
use
and
wont
came
to
her
aid
edgar
this
is
what
clare
wrote
i
have
found
something
among
my
papers
which
seems
to
me
very
important
important
to
everybody
and
to
you
above
all
i
have
not
read
it
only
just
seen
a
word
or
two
which
have
made
me
very
unhappy
i
thought
i
would
try
to
keep
it
from
you
but
i
find
i
can
not
come
then
and
see
what
it
means
it
is
of
more
importance
than
anything
you
can
be
doing
come
immediately
if
i
may
ask
that
much
of
you
come
without
any
delay
this
was
all
the
subscription
she
could
bring
herself
to
put
when
she
had
read
it
over
and
placed
it
in
an
envelope
she
put
it
down
on
the
blotting
book
in
front
of
his
seat
it
was
a
kind
of
test
which
she
felt
herself
to
be
applying
if
the
letter
disappeared
before
morning
she
would
accept
it
as
a
supernatural
intimation
that
it
ought
not
to
be
sent
if
not
to
such
a
pass
her
mind
had
come
which
was
in
general
so
free
from
any
fear
or
consciousness
of
the
supernatural
when
she
had
done
this
she
took
up
her
packet
again
and
went
upstairs
and
replaced
it
under
her
pillow
and
thus
worn
out
with
all
she
had
gone
through
clare
slept
she
had
not
expected
it
but
she
fell
asleep
like
a
child
fatigue
excitement
and
that
long
conflict
had
been
of
use
to
her
in
this
one
way
from
which
she
could
derive
any
help
or
consolation
and
then
she
had
done
something
which
must
be
decisive
and
settle
the
matter
without
any
further
action
of
her
own
chapter
xx
while
all
these
schemes
and
dreams
were
going
on
at
arden
edgar
was
learning
to
accustom
himself
to
the
life
of
a
young
man
about
town
a
thing
which
it
was
almost
as
hard
for
him
to
do
as
it
would
have
been
for
any
of
the
male
butterflies
whom
he
was
attempting
to
emulate
to
settle
down
to
work
edgar
found
it
very
hard
work
to
adapt
himself
to
the
systematic
diversions
of
society
to
portion
out
his
hours
and
engagements
on
the
theory
of
killing
time
and
getting
through
as
much
amusement
as
possible
to
him
the
world
was
full
of
amusement
taken
simply
by
itself
or
else
of
something
more
satisfactory
more
important
which
made
amusement
unnecessary
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
be
vacant
of
interest
either
in
his
own
affairs
or
those
of
his
neighbours
and
consequently
a
system
which
is
built
upon
the
theory
that
time
is
enemy
and
must
be
killed
laboriously
did
not
at
all
suit
him
but
yet
his
mind
was
so
fresh
that
he
found
it
possible
to
shift
his
interest
to
get
concerned
about
the
new
people
round
him
and
their
new
ways
which
were
so
wonderful
not
the
german
professors
with
their
speculations
their
talk
their
music
and
their
nor
their
wives
and
daughters
at
once
so
notable
and
so
sentimental
nor
the
english
farmers
and
peasants
of
arden
were
really
so
wonderful
to
edgar
as
the
ways
of
mayfair
in
june
he
would
sit
and
listen
with
eyes
which
shone
with
fun
and
wonder
while
the
people
about
him
went
gravely
on
making
and
their
engagements
promising
to
go
there
promising
not
to
go
here
rising
into
wild
excitement
about
a
difficult
invitation
dining
dancing
driving
riding
sauntering
at
flower
shows
at
zoological
gardens
at
afternoon
teas
at
garden
parties
counting
the
row
and
the
park
as
sacred
duties
considering
as
serious
occupation
the
scribbling
of
notes
and
considering
the
gossip
about
lord
this
and
lady
that
to
be
matter
of
european
interest
and
how
seriously
they
did
it
all
how
important
they
felt
themselves
with
all
that
mass
of
engagements
on
hand
every
hour
of
every
day
forestalled
edgar
looked
on
laughing
and
then
gradually
got
beyond
laughing
it
was
difficult
for
so
sympathetic
a
spirit
to
live
long
in
such
an
atmosphere
without
beginning
to
feel
that
there
must
be
some
intrinsic
value
in
the
system
which
was
held
in
such
high
esteem
by
all
around
him
he
was
bewildered
in
his
great
candour
he
laughed
and
then
growing
silent
only
smiled
and
then
began
to
ponder
and
wonder
and
ask
himself
questions
perhaps
it
was
well
on
the
whole
that
as
the
apex
of
a
great
social
system
founded
upon
a
vast
basis
of
labour
and
suffering
and
pain
there
should
be
this
human
froth
or
rather
those
bubbles
sparkling
in
the
sun
those
snowy
and
gleaming
surface
ripples
to
cover
and
beautify
the
depths
below
was
it
well
he
could
not
come
to
any
very
satisfactory
conclusion
with
himself
it
was
easy
to
laugh
and
easy
to
condemn
and
equally
easy
when
one
was
trained
to
it
to
take
it
as
the
natural
condition
of
affairs
but
here
as
in
all
other
cases
it
was
the
attempt
to
discriminate
what
was
good
and
what
was
bad
what
was
mere
frivolity
and
what
had
some
human
use
in
it
which
was
the
difficult
matter
the
puzzle
brought
a
look
of
wonder
to
brown
eyes
you
going
to
lady
harry
thornleigh
would
say
to
him
is
a
horrible
should
you
go
then
edgar
would
answer
dear
fellow
everybody
will
be
everybody
will
be
bored
said
edgar
if
everybody
survives
it
will
do
the
same
and
and
why
you
do
something
that
interests
you
all
you
fellows
would
be
a
still
more
confounded
bore
said
harry
and
what
could
the
new
man
do
but
shrug
his
shoulders
and
give
up
the
discussion
he
himself
was
the
only
one
perhaps
among
them
who
was
not
in
the
least
bored
there
was
something
even
in
lady
party
that
occupied
edgar
sometimes
he
was
interested
sometimes
amused
and
sometimes
very
much
saddened
by
what
he
saw
and
then
personal
risks
surrounded
him
which
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
or
realise
augusta
is
to
be
there
i
suppose
and
your
sisters
so
that
i
think
i
shall
be
bored
he
had
said
to
harry
thornleigh
in
reference
to
this
very
party
and
harry
said
nothing
but
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
at
this
plain
speaking
of
them
is
it
i
wonder
he
mused
to
himself
as
he
went
off
i
hope
for
gussy
was
her
favourite
and
he
felt
it
would
be
very
pleasant
as
lady
augusta
did
to
have
the
pleasantest
and
brightest
and
most
of
the
girls
settled
so
near
as
arden
but
in
point
of
fact
edgar
had
no
intention
of
settling
any
one
at
arden
he
was
still
quite
faithful
to
his
sway
if
clare
were
to
marry
and
go
away
then
indeed
he
would
no
doubt
feel
the
loneliness
uncomfortable
but
at
present
it
would
have
seemed
something
like
high
treason
to
edgar
to
dethrone
his
sister
such
an
idea
had
never
entered
into
his
mind
but
he
was
fond
of
lady
augusta
who
was
like
a
mother
to
him
and
he
was
fond
of
her
daughter
indeed
of
all
her
daughters
whom
he
regarded
with
the
freshest
and
most
cordial
sentiment
he
was
always
ready
to
get
their
carriage
to
do
anything
for
them
he
was
not
afraid
as
so
many
men
were
to
himself
and
therefore
as
society
does
not
understand
brotherly
affection
on
the
part
of
a
young
man
towards
young
women
everybody
decided
that
one
of
the
thornleigh
girls
was
to
be
his
lawful
owner
there
was
some
difficulty
in
the
common
mind
as
to
which
was
the
fortunate
individual
but
gussy
was
so
distinctly
indicated
by
the
family
for
the
post
that
naturally
no
one
else
had
a
chance
against
her
and
this
conclusion
was
really
the
most
natural
that
could
be
drawn
edgar
though
he
was
so
friendly
and
so
frank
was
yet
in
some
respects
a
shy
man
and
he
clung
to
the
people
he
knew
best
when
he
was
with
the
thornleighs
he
was
free
from
every
shade
of
embarrassment
he
knew
them
all
so
well
he
thought
they
were
so
kind
to
him
they
understood
him
and
his
ways
of
thinking
so
completely
he
believed
when
he
went
to
them
it
was
like
going
home
entering
into
his
family
a
more
genial
family
and
one
more
apt
to
understand
than
he
had
ever
known
and
it
was
to
the
thornleighs
that
edgar
allowed
himself
to
speak
most
freely
of
his
own
wonderments
and
perplexities
look
at
you
all
with
amazement
he
said
disapprove
of
very
nice
of
him
interrupted
gussy
look
very
pretty
said
beatrice
making
him
a
curtsey
and
you
are
very
pleasant
of
course
i
mean
ladies
in
particular
you
savage
ejaculated
mary
the
second
youngest
who
was
a
little
disposed
to
hold
views
but
did
not
understand
them
in
the
very
least
i
mean
everybody
all
this
is
very
nice
it
is
charming
never
to
take
any
thought
for
the
morrow
except
which
invitation
one
will
accept
or
rather
which
place
one
will
go
to
of
all
that
one
has
accepted
the
only
thing
is
what
is
the
good
of
it
all
it
tires
you
so
that
you
require
nine
rest
to
refresh
you
and
get
you
up
to
the
point
of
doing
all
this
over
again
and
while
you
are
doing
it
you
call
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
what
a
bore
it
is
would
it
not
be
better
to
try
some
other
kind
of
useful
exertion
now
and
then
three
work
in
the
fields
for
instance
or
as
poor
needlewomen
or
even
in
one
of
those
pretty
shops
a
shop
that
is
worse
and
worse
that
is
more
frightful
than
ever
i
should
prefer
the
fields
said
beatrice
and
mary
in
a
breath
fields
are
exposed
to
a
great
deal
of
rain
and
cold
drought
and
wet
frost
and
all
kinds
of
perils
said
edgar
then
they
would
spoil
your
complexions
ask
lady
augusta
she
would
never
let
you
do
that
but
these
beautiful
shops
you
know
such
as
that
you
took
me
to
smallgear
or
something
and
then
that
one
in
regent
street
why
they
are
palaces
soft
carpets
under
your
feet
and
great
mirrors
to
display
you
in
and
beautiful
things
to
handle
i
should
think
it
rather
nice
to
belong
to
one
of
those
possibly
mean
it
cried
gussy
concerned
for
the
credit
of
the
man
who
was
so
generally
assigned
to
her
what
an
occupation
it
must
be
turning
over
things
to
be
pulled
about
by
ladies
who
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
otherwise
and
never
mean
to
said
edgar
are
not
criticising
we
are
merely
taking
facts
as
we
find
them
if
it
amuses
the
ladies
to
turn
the
things
over
the
men
in
the
shops
are
really
more
useful
to
them
than
the
other
men
who
go
to
their
five
tea
and
now
and
then
there
comes
a
purchaser
whereas
for
you
young
ladies
what
could
be
better
trying
on
pretty
shawls
and
things
i
saw
them
exercising
the
highest
qualities
of
making
your
prettiness
and
gracefulness
of
use
to
others
and
yet
having
your
time
to
yourselves
say
after
six
or
seven
you
would
see
the
best
of
company
all
the
same
dessus
la
you
think
it
would
be
a
very
pleasant
change
you
would
treat
it
seriously
and
really
consider
how
little
women
are
allowed
to
do
arden
cried
helena
thornleigh
who
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
encourage
mere
chatter
like
her
sisters
am
sure
you
might
be
a
great
help
to
us
see
what
a
desert
our
lives
are
with
no
object
in
them
you
see
what
vapid
aimless
useless
creatures
the
most
of
us
are
beg
your
pardon
said
edgar
feel
that
it
is
frightfully
selfish
but
all
my
sympathies
in
the
first
place
are
for
my
own
class
stop
till
i
have
made
that
out
i
will
come
to
the
ladies
we
never
have
a
time
for
anything
we
are
always
pursued
by
work
which
has
to
be
done
whether
it
is
riding
in
the
park
or
going
to
the
opera
or
dining
at
richmond
how
stern
duty
runs
after
your
brother
for
instance
always
reminding
him
of
some
engagement
or
other
poor
harry
finds
it
a
dreadful
bore
he
says
so
and
he
ought
to
know
best
he
is
always
bemoaning
his
hard
fate
and
yet
he
always
goes
on
obeying
it
i
object
to
routine
and
i
object
to
suffering
they
are
both
good
things
enough
but
to
suffer
and
be
a
slave
to
routine
all
for
nothing
is
very
hard
i
confess
i
think
it
is
very
hard
to
be
sure
harry
need
not
do
it
unless
he
likes
but
that
he
should
like
and
should
go
on
doing
it
and
should
not
be
able
to
find
something
better
that
is
what
puzzles
say
said
harry
who
was
over
a
book
is
that
about
me
i
want
to
be
made
to
point
a
moral
in
this
house
the
girls
turn
me
to
that
use
fast
enough
what
is
arden
saying
now
that
is
very
remarkable
said
edgar
that
we
poor
fellows
or
you
poor
fellows
get
half
enough
credit
for
the
hard
life
you
lead
you
give
yourselves
as
much
trouble
as
if
you
were
founding
a
state
or
reforming
society
and
all
the
time
you
are
doing
nothing
i
object
to
it
if
a
man
likes
to
spend
his
life
so
why
of
course
he
is
free
to
do
it
he
is
a
british
subject
like
the
rest
of
us
but
i
want
to
know
who
invented
this
theory
of
existence
and
how
men
were
got
to
give
in
to
it
that
is
is
all
they
are
good
for
said
helena
thornleigh
is
partly
education
and
partly
nature
boys
are
brought
up
to
think
that
they
are
to
have
everything
they
want
they
are
never
obliged
to
deny
themselves
or
think
of
others
however
silly
or
frivolous
a
thing
may
be
they
are
free
to
do
it
if
they
like
and
they
have
everything
open
to
them
they
go
where
they
like
they
live
as
they
please
a
very
fine
thing
they
make
of
it
said
edgar
reflectively
as
the
young
reformer
paused
for
breath
thornleigh
when
you
begin
to
work
upon
the
young
ladies
i
think
i
ought
to
have
a
try
at
the
men
we
might
go
halves
in
a
crusade
we
should
disagree
in
this
though
for
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
the
ladies
you
are
all
very
nice
you
are
just
what
you
ought
to
arden
i
hate
compliments
said
helena
growing
red
with
indignation
you
make
those
sort
of
speeches
i
should
like
to
do
something
disagreeable
we
are
not
in
the
least
nice
oh
i
believe
in
your
crusade
you
are
not
half
earnest
enough
you
laugh
and
jibe
and
then
you
ask
us
to
believe
that
you
have
a
serious
meaning
that
is
not
how
i
should
take
it
up
you
half
understand
you
realise
how
serious
it
is
i
may
not
share
in
the
missionary
work
said
edgar
and
he
was
a
little
surprised
when
gussy
interposed
with
a
slight
flush
on
her
face
you
were
working
with
helena
people
would
not
believe
much
in
your
seriousness
said
gussy
would
not
give
you
much
credit
either
one
or
the
other
missions
are
not
understood
in
society
or
i
suppose
they
are
too
well
understood
said
gussy
with
a
laugh
she
had
been
aggravated
as
everybody
may
perceive
edgar
was
her
special
property
allotted
to
her
by
the
world
in
general
and
what
had
helena
to
do
with
him
cutting
in
like
this
with
her
missionary
work
and
her
nonsense
gussy
felt
that
she
had
very
good
reason
to
be
put
out
and
helena
though
she
was
a
missionary
was
woman
enough
to
see
the
justice
of
the
irritation
and
to
cover
her
retreat
hate
missions
she
said
had
much
better
go
on
in
our
own
way
and
then
what
arden
wants
and
what
i
want
are
two
very
different
things
he
is
only
amused
but
it
goes
to
my
very
heart
miss
thornleigh
look
round
upon
all
the
women
i
know
and
see
them
without
any
occupation
said
helena
and
dancing
that
is
about
all
we
do
and
when
we
make
an
effort
after
something
better
we
are
snubbed
and
thrust
down
on
every
side
our
people
stop
us
our
friends
sneer
at
us
they
tell
us
to
go
and
amuse
ourselves
but
i
am
sick
of
amusing
myself
i
have
done
it
for
three
years
and
i
hate
it
i
want
something
better
to
harry
does
not
hate
it
said
edgar
turning
his
eyes
once
more
upon
the
eldest
son
harry
was
not
at
all
a
bad
fellow
he
tossed
the
book
he
had
been
reading
away
from
him
and
twisted
his
moustache
and
pulled
his
cuffs
think
a
confounded
bore
said
harry
and
then
he
got
up
and
strolled
away
this
conversation
took
place
in
a
house
which
had
shuddered
from
garret
to
basement
at
the
thought
of
not
being
able
to
get
cards
for
lady
ball
harry
had
roused
himself
up
for
that
occasion
and
had
shown
an
energy
which
was
almost
superhuman
he
had
rushed
about
london
as
if
his
mission
had
been
to
stop
a
war
or
save
a
kingdom
his
scheme
of
operations
was
as
elaborate
and
careful
as
if
it
had
been
a
campaign
and
even
helena
had
forgotten
all
about
the
injuries
of
women
and
had
rushed
to
meet
her
brother
at
the
door
and
to
ask
news
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
she
thought
dancing
the
real
employment
of
life
such
relapses
into
levity
may
be
pardoned
to
a
young
philosopher
but
they
were
very
strange
to
edgar
who
with
the
wondering
clear
mystified
eyes
of
a
was
looking
on
chapter
xxi
it
was
not
however
edgar
intention
to
preach
any
crusade
on
the
contrary
the
first
impulse
of
his
friendly
and
soul
was
to
find
out
some
reason
for
the
existence
which
seemed
so
strange
to
him
he
tried
to
approach
in
a
great
many
different
ways
and
evoke
out
of
it
as
it
were
or
surprise
out
of
it
its
secrets
it
could
not
exist
he
said
to
himself
without
a
meaning
edgar
was
not
very
profound
in
his
philosophy
but
still
he
had
a
way
of
thinking
of
what
he
saw
and
his
amused
interest
in
everything
led
him
into
a
world
of
questions
besides
he
was
not
merely
conversant
with
harry
thornleigh
and
his
class
but
also
with
various
other
divisions
of
society
he
saw
a
good
deal
of
lord
newmarch
for
instance
who
was
entirely
a
different
kind
of
man
and
he
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
some
men
whom
he
had
met
abroad
in
his
earlier
days
one
of
whom
was
a
great
cricketer
and
another
who
was
of
the
alpine
club
and
whose
soul
dwelt
habitually
in
the
sacred
recesses
of
the
matterhorn
or
jungfrau
except
lord
newmarch
and
his
set
these
men
were
all
utterly
disinterested
pursuing
their
favourite
amusements
not
for
any
purpose
to
be
gained
but
for
the
mere
sake
of
the
pursuit
itself
the
alpine
club
man
had
no
curiosity
about
the
view
from
the
and
cared
nothing
for
the
formation
of
the
glaciers
or
any
other
subject
connected
with
his
mountains
all
his
object
was
to
get
to
the
top
and
he
did
get
to
a
great
many
tops
and
distinguished
himself
and
acquired
various
bits
of
practical
knowledge
which
having
no
connection
of
purpose
or
interest
in
his
mind
were
of
little
use
to
himself
and
none
to
others
and
so
likewise
the
men
who
devoted
themselves
to
society
did
not
expect
to
be
amused
or
instructed
or
to
meet
people
they
liked
or
to
find
in
it
any
of
those
solaces
which
theorists
pretend
they
went
because
everybody
went
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
just
for
the
sake
of
going
and
no
other
reason
this
disinterestedness
was
the
great
thing
that
struck
edgar
he
himself
was
aware
that
he
did
not
at
all
possess
it
he
was
continually
desiring
some
result
pleasure
or
advantage
of
some
description
which
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
he
reflected
is
a
mean
way
of
treating
existence
after
all
whereas
society
was
grand
in
its
indifference
to
any
issue
it
lived
it
assembled
it
talked
it
went
to
and
fro
and
gave
itself
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
from
all
this
exertion
it
expected
nothing
to
come
this
was
the
first
discovery
edgar
made
or
thought
he
made
and
it
staggered
him
much
in
the
contempt
for
society
which
he
had
been
settling
into
was
not
this
in
reality
a
higher
principle
than
his
own
it
bewildered
him
and
he
could
not
make
it
out
and
lord
newmarch
though
he
was
a
social
philosopher
of
much
greater
experience
than
edgar
did
not
seem
capable
of
giving
him
any
aid
know
what
you
mean
by
disinterestedness
lord
newmarch
said
is
nobody
who
is
disinterested
we
have
some
selfish
object
in
whatever
we
do
i
think
for
my
own
part
that
i
desire
sincerely
the
good
of
the
country
and
make
it
the
grand
object
of
my
life
but
i
know
that
i
want
the
country
to
be
benefited
in
way
not
in
any
one
we
are
all
like
that
there
is
my
brother
everard
do
you
see
making
himself
very
agreeable
to
that
great
fat
woman
he
hates
fat
women
and
that
one
in
particular
i
know
but
he
is
being
so
very
civil
to
her
because
he
wants
her
to
ask
him
to
her
garden
party
which
is
coming
off
next
week
he
is
going
to
call
her
carriage
for
her
like
a
humbug
as
he
is
but
all
with
the
most
selfish
and
interested
allow
that
said
edgar
allow
that
anybody
will
do
anything
for
an
invitation
but
why
should
he
wish
to
go
to
her
garden
party
that
is
what
i
want
to
dear
fellow
said
lord
newmarch
shrugging
his
shoulders
even
i
am
going
everybody
will
be
he
want
to
meet
everybody
said
edgar
does
continually
and
he
is
sick
of
them
does
he
want
to
see
any
one
in
particular
does
he
think
he
will
enjoy
himself
is
it
for
the
pleasure
of
it
he
is
going
when
he
has
got
his
invitation
he
will
say
what
a
confounded
bore
he
knows
exactly
beforehand
what
it
will
be
like
well
then
i
say
he
is
utterly
disinterested
he
is
going
for
the
sake
of
going
it
is
not
to
make
him
happier
or
amuse
him
or
benefit
him
and
everybody
is
going
just
for
the
same
reason
surely
something
might
be
made
of
this
wonderful
disinterestedness
it
can
not
be
meant
to
be
wasted
upon
garden
parties
and
lady
dear
arden
you
mistake
completely
said
lord
newmarch
with
even
a
little
irritation
nonsense
you
see
they
want
it
to
be
known
they
have
been
there
everybody
will
be
there
and
out
of
the
list
if
one
name
was
wanting
you
see
that
the
owner
of
it
would
lose
a
certain
position
he
would
feel
himself
left
out
of
course
you
have
a
card
you
are
one
of
the
most
eligible
young
men
of
the
season
there
is
no
telling
what
fears
and
hopes
you
are
exciting
in
some
gentle
breasts
disinterested
that
shows
how
little
you
and
even
lord
newmarch
laughed
a
refined
little
laugh
not
much
like
him
he
was
drawn
out
of
his
usual
for
the
moment
by
the
exceeding
simplicity
of
his
friend
a
thing
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
there
is
no
saying
how
many
fair
huntresses
will
go
there
in
search
of
you
he
said
are
the
happy
where
every
woman
is
permitted
to
shoot
and
none
of
the
men
dare
run
was
not
speaking
of
women
said
edgar
sharply
for
he
had
a
kindness
for
women
was
talking
of
your
brother
and
the
rest
these
are
not
happy
for
them
there
is
nothing
there
for
them
except
the
mere
fact
that
they
there
they
go
for
the
sake
of
going
the
other
is
poor
enough
but
still
it
is
a
motive
if
it
exists
the
question
is
which
is
finest
my
stupid
search
for
a
motive
or
your
grand
disinterestedness
there
is
something
splendid
you
think
in
seeing
a
man
throw
away
his
life
like
this
do
you
mean
by
throwing
away
a
life
cried
the
social
philosopher
have
become
dreadfully
highflown
an
hour
or
two
in
an
afternoon
in
a
pretty
garden
with
people
about
and
a
band
and
all
that
i
understand
what
you
to
this
edgar
made
no
reply
his
antagonist
had
the
best
of
it
and
yet
he
was
right
and
his
theory
was
just
as
for
the
poor
ladies
who
went
to
those
happy
if
there
was
any
truth
in
it
that
was
a
branch
of
the
subject
more
melancholy
and
more
intricate
still
edgar
preferred
not
to
enter
into
it
he
thought
of
helena
thornleigh
and
her
visions
poor
girl
visions
which
perhaps
were
only
evidences
of
a
spasmodic
state
of
conflict
against
the
happy
fancy
clare
going
out
with
her
bow
and
her
spear
like
the
other
young
dianas
edgar
thought
to
himself
but
then
clare
was
rich
she
had
no
need
to
become
a
huntress
she
like
himself
would
be
the
pursued
and
not
the
pursuer
this
thought
made
the
young
man
faint
and
sick
what
a
ghastly
light
it
threw
upon
all
these
pretty
parties
and
assemblies
of
pleasure
even
the
men
who
sought
nothing
were
better
than
this
are
so
much
more
practical
than
we
are
said
lord
newmarch
see
it
constantly
now
that
i
think
of
it
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
say
the
young
fellows
are
singularly
without
motive
i
see
the
beauty
of
it
as
you
do
they
do
what
other
people
do
but
the
women
always
have
an
object
they
are
trying
to
marry
their
daughters
or
to
marry
themselves
or
to
rise
in
the
social
scale
or
something
which
is
definite
they
are
practical
but
not
in
a
large
way
that
is
what
prevents
them
from
being
so
useful
in
the
way
of
public
work
as
they
ought
to
be
they
or
they
take
a
broad
view
they
fasten
upon
some
matter
of
fact
and
stick
to
that
it
is
all
very
well
you
know
for
a
girl
with
helena
notions
to
talk
as
she
does
in
that
grand
vague
way
but
observe
how
women
will
pick
up
a
subject
probably
a
nasty
subject
and
harp
upon
it
i
could
give
you
a
hundred
instances
they
are
not
nasty
women
that
is
the
odd
thing
i
suppose
it
is
from
some
feeling
of
duty
not
to
shrink
from
what
is
most
repugnant
to
them
so
instead
of
shrinking
they
make
a
pounce
upon
it
and
hold
by
it
in
the
most
aggravating
way
i
know
a
woman
who
takes
a
really
large
view
except
your
sister
arden
she
is
the
sort
of
girl
that
would
help
a
man
that
would
be
of
real
use
is
much
obliged
to
you
i
am
sure
said
edgar
interrupting
him
we
were
not
talking
of
my
sister
nor
indeed
of
women
at
all
let
us
settle
with
the
others
first
you
seem
to
understand
that
i
want
information
i
want
to
know
why
these
sons
of
piratical
saxons
and
conquering
normans
and
robber
danes
and
marauding
celts
every
one
of
them
getting
and
taking
as
much
as
ever
they
could
should
have
got
into
this
habit
of
spending
their
lives
for
nothing
neither
gain
nor
honour
nor
pleasure
nor
advantage
to
others
nor
profit
to
themselves
that
is
what
i
make
sort
of
thing
only
lasts
for
three
months
or
so
said
lord
newmarch
there
is
grouse
and
so
forth
never
mind
them
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
but
arden
i
wish
you
would
make
up
your
mind
to
go
into
parliament
and
give
your
attention
to
more
serious
matters
we
have
too
many
of
those
young
fellows
who
mean
nothing
and
we
have
too
many
who
mean
just
one
thing
in
particular
your
rich
and
so
forth
they
are
not
bad
so
far
as
they
go
but
they
are
like
women
they
never
take
a
broad
view
they
think
themselves
radicals
but
some
of
them
are
as
narrow
and
limited
as
old
wives
in
a
village
and
then
there
are
our
old
squires
who
are
narrow
in
another
way
they
understand
things
as
this
century
understands
them
the
most
enlightened
of
them
will
turn
short
round
upon
you
all
at
once
and
join
in
some
insane
cry
we
want
young
men
arden
men
of
independent
minds
who
have
been
used
to
think
for
themselves
if
you
were
a
tory
of
the
old
arden
type
you
would
have
been
the
last
man
i
should
have
made
overtures
to
and
what
is
odd
about
it
is
that
your
sister
is
of
the
old
arden
type
and
yet
for
the
best
kind
of
reform
i
should
trust
her
instincts
she
is
not
one
of
those
who
would
be
afraid
of
such
words
as
liberty
or
despotism
liberty
means
something
more
than
giving
a
man
a
vote
and
the
people
never
like
you
any
the
worse
for
using
a
little
dignified
force
it
must
be
real
force
however
not
sham
and
it
must
be
used
with
dignity
your
sister
fully
understands
mind
my
sister
said
edgar
with
some
impatience
i
must
mind
your
sister
said
lord
newmarch
dear
arden
i
wish
so
much
you
would
give
me
your
ear
for
a
little
i
never
met
anyone
who
entered
into
all
my
views
like
miss
arden
i
can
not
tell
you
for
anything
i
could
say
would
sound
exaggerated
how
much
i
admire
her
i
have
too
great
a
respect
for
her
to
venture
to
approach
herself
till
i
have
your
approval
if
you
should
know
any
obstacle
any
difficulty
you
must
know
better
than
anyone
what
a
treasure
she
edgar
was
disposed
to
be
angry
and
then
he
was
disposed
to
laugh
but
he
did
neither
feeling
himself
in
too
grave
a
position
to
permit
any
levity
the
fellow
he
said
to
himself
take
me
very
much
by
surprise
he
said
when
he
had
composed
himself
a
little
had
not
the
least
expectation
of
any
such
proposal
from
you
not
from
me
from
any
other
then
asked
newmarch
with
anxiety
thought
you
could
not
fail
to
remark
before
i
left
your
house
ah
arden
that
visit
i
had
known
her
before
of
course
for
years
but
there
are
moments
when
a
existence
bursts
upon
you
like
a
revelation
however
long
you
may
have
known
her
such
a
revelation
then
happened
to
me
so
beautiful
so
dignified
so
truly
liberal
in
her
views
so
full
of
real
insight
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
such
a
match
would
receive
the
most
complete
sanction
of
my
family
and
i
trust
it
would
not
be
disagreeable
to
am
sure
you
do
clare
and
myself
great
honour
said
edgar
you
must
pardon
me
for
being
quite
unprepared
i
know
in
the
least
what
my
feelings
may
be
of
course
it
is
for
her
and
for
her
alone
to
decide
you
know
i
have
been
little
at
home
i
know
of
no
difficulties
no
but
my
opinion
on
this
point
is
really
of
very
little
importance
he
continued
pausing
with
a
recollection
of
arthur
arden
which
was
anything
but
comforting
is
clare
only
who
can
if
such
a
happiness
should
be
in
store
for
me
said
lord
newmarch
always
correct
in
his
expressions
might
hope
that
i
should
meet
with
no
disapproval
from
you
my
decision
should
be
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
do
my
best
to
carry
it
out
said
edgar
who
was
confused
by
this
sudden
attack
and
they
stood
together
for
five
minutes
in
an
embarrassed
silence
and
then
separated
to
the
great
relief
of
both
this
sudden
declaration
was
to
edgar
what
a
bomb
suddenly
falling
without
any
warning
would
be
to
the
inhabitants
of
a
peaceful
town
he
was
quite
unprepared
for
it
his
mind
was
full
of
other
things
occupied
with
a
hundred
novelties
quite
detached
for
the
moment
from
arden
and
its
concerns
he
had
even
half
forgotten
the
original
cause
which
made
him
leave
home
and
his
fears
for
his
sister
he
walked
to
his
rooms
that
evening
from
the
house
where
this
conversation
had
taken
place
and
found
himself
thrown
back
at
once
to
his
home
and
its
more
intimate
concerns
he
had
left
clare
alone
much
to
his
annoyance
but
she
assured
him
she
preferred
being
alone
and
arthur
arden
had
given
him
the
slip
and
declined
his
invitation
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
season
with
him
in
town
clare
had
not
mentioned
arthur
in
any
of
her
letters
no
doubt
he
must
be
at
the
end
of
the
world
forming
new
plans
perhaps
pursuing
some
new
love
it
was
folly
to
think
of
him
as
edgar
felt
himself
doing
the
moment
affairs
were
thus
brought
before
his
mind
he
had
been
so
easily
able
to
dismiss
arthur
that
he
had
ceased
thinking
of
him
as
dangerous
but
now
he
kept
presenting
himself
like
a
spectre
wherever
edgar
turned
his
eyes
wonder
where
the
fellow
is
i
wonder
how
those
fellows
manage
he
ought
to
have
a
secured
income
he
said
to
himself
and
yet
could
not
make
out
why
it
was
that
when
he
ought
to
be
thinking
of
clare
it
was
arthur
arden
he
began
to
think
of
arthur
who
had
divined
lord
newmarch
and
hated
him
mind
was
full
of
excitement
it
is
so
much
more
easy
to
philosophise
about
things
which
affect
ourselves
personally
he
had
been
amused
and
quite
calm
when
he
discussed
with
himself
the
doings
of
mayfair
but
when
it
was
arden
that
was
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
he
was
not
calm
thus
it
was
the
most
steady
and
serious
among
all
his
friends
and
acquaintances
who
threw
this
sudden
barb
into
life
chapter
xxii
think
you
are
happy
in
town
arden
said
gussy
thornleigh
the
next
time
edgar
presented
himself
in
berkeley
square
when
we
saw
you
last
at
home
you
said
you
were
not
coming
what
made
you
resolve
to
come
after
all
the
truth
was
that
gussy
supposed
it
was
herself
who
had
made
him
come
this
had
been
taken
for
granted
by
all
the
family
and
gussy
naturally
had
believed
it
or
at
least
had
tried
to
believe
it
a
point
on
which
however
her
good
sense
made
a
feeble
conflict
with
that
happy
girlish
vanity
which
as
yet
had
not
experienced
many
rebuffs
privately
in
the
retirement
of
her
own
chamber
she
had
already
disclosed
her
scepticism
to
her
sister
helena
believe
he
came
after
me
she
said
thinks
so
and
harry
thinks
so
but
i
believe
it
is
only
their
innocence
they
understand
edgar
arden
he
is
fond
of
me
and
he
is
fond
of
you
and
he
does
not
care
a
bit
for
either
of
us
that
is
my
opinion
he
wants
to
make
friends
of
us
all
the
same
as
if
we
were
not
why
he
asked
helena
with
some
indignation
not
that
she
cared
for
edgar
arden
but
for
the
principle
being
a
man
does
not
make
any
difference
to
me
and
why
should
it
make
a
difference
to
him
that
i
am
a
girl
but
it
does
make
a
difference
said
wiser
gussy
not
when
people
are
older
but
i
know
any
except
fast
girls
who
go
and
their
friendship
with
men
i
think
he
came
for
me
i
think
i
shall
ask
him
some
day
quite
promiscuous
that
he
may
not
be
put
on
his
guard
and
i
shall
soon
see
if
it
is
for
it
was
in
accordance
with
this
resolution
that
she
spoke
and
her
question
was
promiscuous
as
she
said
interjected
into
the
midst
of
a
conversation
with
which
it
had
nothing
to
do
edgar
bore
the
test
with
a
composure
which
satisfied
intellect
at
once
though
it
somewhat
depressed
her
in
spite
of
herself
could
not
help
it
he
said
quite
seriously
seemed
a
way
out
of
a
difficulty
i
am
not
quite
sure
now
that
it
was
a
wise
way
but
then
it
seemed
the
gussy
looked
at
him
with
a
little
surprise
he
was
so
perfectly
composed
and
unmoved
evidently
quite
unaware
of
the
interpretation
that
had
been
placed
on
his
change
of
purpose
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
in
the
very
least
and
yet
it
was
a
shock
to
her
vanity
to
see
how
unconscious
he
was
of
the
supposed
reason
might
have
complimented
and
made
belief
a
little
she
said
to
herself
is
no
need
for
being
so
deadly
odd
that
you
should
have
to
do
anything
like
that
she
said
aloud
is
like
one
of
our
expedients
but
you
can
do
just
as
you
like
at
least
helena
tells
us
so
and
i
suppose
men
can
think
men
can
said
edgar
laughing
least
not
men
like
myself
the
fact
was
i
had
a
guest
whom
i
did
not
wish
to
keep
any
longer
you
must
be
kind
and
not
betray
said
gussy
with
promptitude
opening
her
eyes
wide
at
the
same
time
in
wonder
at
such
a
confession
be
angry
with
me
she
resumed
do
so
like
to
know
everything
about
my
friends
do
tell
me
was
it
arthur
arden
mamma
would
scold
me
dreadfully
for
asking
but
i
should
so
like
to
know
there
tell
me
any
more
i
can
see
it
was
by
your
eyes
i
know
some
people
like
him
but
he
is
very
nice
i
think
you
might
have
let
him
you
think
he
is
very
nice
said
edgar
who
was
as
she
had
divined
very
fond
of
gussy
though
not
according
to
her
own
dialect
in
way
said
gussy
jumping
by
instinct
into
the
heart
of
the
question
thing
is
you
know
but
you
serious
people
can
not
understand
that
he
never
anything
he
is
very
attentive
and
all
that
it
is
his
way
with
girls
he
makes
you
think
there
never
was
any
one
like
you
and
that
he
never
had
such
an
opinion
of
anybody
before
and
all
that
but
he
never
means
anything
even
mamma
says
so
a
very
young
girl
might
be
taken
in
but
we
all
know
that
he
means
nothing
and
i
assure
you
he
is
very
understand
how
such
a
man
can
be
very
nice
said
edgar
with
subdued
annoyance
for
he
did
not
quite
like
the
idea
that
gussy
herself
should
have
gone
through
this
discipline
or
made
such
a
discovery
like
people
who
mean
more
and
not
less
than
they
is
all
very
well
arden
in
most
matters
said
gussy
with
a
little
hesitation
and
a
momentary
blush
wonder
if
means
anything
she
was
asking
herself
but
edgar
was
looking
at
her
with
the
simplest
straightforwardness
and
making
no
pretences
you
know
when
it
is
only
just
the
common
chatter
of
society
well
why
should
everybody
be
so
dreadfully
sincere
people
may
just
as
well
be
agreeable
i
am
not
standing
up
for
flirting
or
that
sort
of
thing
but
still
you
know
when
you
are
quite
sure
that
nothing
is
meant
confuse
my
mind
altogether
said
edgar
am
bewildered
enough
as
it
is
you
go
to
places
not
to
be
amused
but
because
everybody
is
going
you
do
things
you
care
for
because
everybody
does
them
and
now
you
tell
me
men
are
very
because
they
never
mean
anything
my
brain
is
going
very
fast
but
i
think
this
last
doctrine
is
the
most
confusing
of
would
see
the
sense
of
it
if
you
were
in
our
position
said
gussy
shaking
her
pretty
head
for
instance
arthur
arden
suppose
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
he
was
really
in
love
with
one
of
us
it
sounds
ridiculous
does
it
not
what
do
you
suppose
papa
and
mamma
would
say
they
would
send
him
out
of
the
house
very
quickly
you
may
be
sure
and
the
poor
girl
whoever
it
was
would
be
scolded
to
death
oh
there
would
be
such
a
business
in
the
house
worse
than
there
was
when
poor
fred
burton
wanted
to
marry
ada
perhaps
you
never
heard
of
that
indeed
said
edgar
to
whom
ada
who
was
the
quiet
one
had
always
appeared
the
least
interesting
of
the
family
was
the
curate
at
thorne
said
gussy
of
course
he
ought
never
to
have
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
but
harry
had
been
at
college
with
him
and
he
was
very
nice
and
came
to
us
constantly
i
liked
him
myself
indeed
we
all
liked
him
and
if
he
only
had
had
two
thousand
or
so
or
even
less
as
he
was
a
clergyman
but
he
had
only
about
twopence
said
gussy
with
a
sigh
what
was
poor
papa
to
do
miss
thornleigh
asked
edgar
with
all
the
impulsive
interest
in
a
love
story
which
comes
natural
to
an
unsophisticated
mind
ada
was
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
with
a
great
basket
before
her
full
of
pieces
of
coloured
print
she
was
making
little
frocks
for
her
poor
children
a
work
in
which
by
fits
and
starts
the
other
girls
would
give
her
uncertain
aid
ada
said
gussy
with
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
then
she
glanced
at
her
sister
and
a
glimmer
of
moisture
came
into
the
corners
of
her
bright
eyes
is
the
greatest
darling
that
ever
was
i
think
there
is
anybody
so
good
in
the
whole
world
she
said
under
her
breath
and
dashed
away
that
drop
of
dew
from
her
eyelashes
is
so
absurd
to
make
any
fuss
she
added
a
moment
after
knows
it
must
be
but
one
can
not
help
being
sorry
sometimes
when
one
sees
and
here
voice
failed
her
and
she
bit
her
lip
that
she
might
not
be
proved
to
have
broken
down
are
a
dear
kind
girl
to
feel
for
her
so
cried
edgar
putting
out
his
hand
to
give
her
a
grasp
of
sympathy
and
then
he
remembered
suddenly
that
he
was
a
man
and
she
a
woman
and
that
an
invisible
line
was
stretched
between
them
is
very
hard
he
said
checking
himself
with
a
half
laugh
you
are
not
your
brother
or
i
my
own
sister
for
the
moment
because
i
must
not
say
i
suppose
how
sorry
i
am
nor
how
i
like
you
for
it
but
i
do
all
the
same
you
think
if
we
were
to
lay
our
heads
together
and
get
him
a
living
hush
said
gussy
growing
paler
and
this
time
quite
unable
to
conceal
the
tears
that
rushed
to
her
eyes
you
really
never
hear
about
him
he
died
a
year
ago
it
was
not
our
fault
he
went
to
the
of
london
you
know
and
worked
dreadfully
hard
and
caught
a
fever
oh
will
you
take
that
chair
between
me
and
ada
please
you
see
she
always
wears
black
and
white
nothing
else
but
you
men
never
notice
what
any
one
edgar
made
the
change
as
he
was
desired
and
this
time
all
the
etiquettes
that
ever
were
invented
would
not
have
kept
him
from
taking
soft
hand
into
his
and
holding
it
kindly
tenderly
as
a
sympathising
brother
might
have
done
he
would
have
taken
her
into
his
arms
had
he
dared
in
affectionate
kindness
and
sympathy
he
was
too
much
moved
to
say
a
word
but
he
held
her
hand
fast
and
looked
at
her
with
his
heart
in
his
eyes
said
gussy
crying
softly
a
kind
friendly
boy
you
are
oh
i
am
sure
i
never
meant
to
talk
of
this
any
more
i
was
in
a
fury
with
papa
and
mamma
at
the
time
and
said
a
great
many
things
i
ought
not
to
have
said
but
of
course
one
knows
that
it
had
to
be
they
could
not
have
done
anything
they
said
edgar
money
everything
then
i
am
a
stranger
in
this
sort
of
a
world
and
i
it
is
not
everything
it
is
a
great
deal
said
gussy
now
you
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
say
a
man
is
nice
who
can
make
himself
nice
without
meaning
anything
why
there
is
you
she
added
with
a
spice
of
malice
do
it
in
arthur
way
but
you
are
very
kind
to
one
and
very
pleasant
and
it
makes
one
so
much
at
ease
when
one
sees
you
mean
anything
there
that
is
a
bold
argument
but
now
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
to
gussy
got
up
when
she
had
delivered
this
shot
and
ran
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
to
get
her
work
as
she
said
leaving
edgar
very
silent
and
considerably
bewildered
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
him
was
he
supposed
to
mean
anything
he
wondered
he
felt
that
he
had
received
an
arrow
but
he
did
not
quite
understand
how
or
why
it
came
and
he
was
a
little
sore
it
must
be
confessed
to
hear
himself
classed
with
arthur
arden
as
one
of
the
men
who
meant
nothing
in
his
own
consciousness
he
meant
a
great
deal
he
meant
the
most
cordial
brotherliness
affection
and
sympathy
he
had
the
thornleighs
as
people
say
he
liked
to
go
to
their
house
he
liked
to
talk
to
them
all
one
almost
as
much
as
the
others
and
lady
augusta
as
much
as
any
of
her
girls
this
was
what
he
meant
but
could
it
be
that
some
other
meaning
was
expected
of
him
then
he
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
lady
augusta
was
quite
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
gussy
had
left
him
and
that
he
was
sitting
all
alone
and
silent
pondering
and
confused
why
should
she
note
so
very
unimportant
a
transaction
and
she
called
him
to
her
side
immediately
on
a
most
transparent
pretext
arden
come
and
tell
me
your
last
news
from
clare
she
said
is
very
of
her
not
to
come
with
you
to
town
and
it
must
be
very
dull
for
her
at
arden
all
by
herself
has
she
got
old
miss
arden
from
escott
or
good
seldon
with
her
what
nobody
that
must
surely
be
dull
even
for
clare
i
thought
said
edgar
she
will
not
come
she
has
so
rooted
a
prejudice
against
those
good
people
the
pimpernels
it
is
a
pity
said
lady
augusta
suppose
you
know
your
cousin
arthur
arden
is
staying
there
cried
edgar
arden
and
he
half
rose
to
go
off
at
once
and
guard
his
sister
whose
imprudence
it
seemed
impossible
to
understand
mean
he
is
at
the
pimpernels
said
lady
augusta
i
suppose
will
have
a
good
deal
of
money
i
have
known
the
day
when
arthur
arden
could
have
done
a
great
deal
better
than
that
but
neither
men
nor
women
improve
their
case
matrimonially
by
growing
older
it
will
be
curious
to
see
him
as
the
husband
of
alice
is
it
certain
that
because
he
is
her
guest
the
other
must
follow
said
edgar
who
asked
the
question
at
random
without
thinking
much
about
it
the
answer
was
a
little
pointed
and
it
found
a
lodgment
in
his
mind
dear
no
arden
but
yet
the
world
is
apt
to
ask
why
does
he
go
there
what
does
he
want
in
that
house
it
is
a
question
that
is
asked
whenever
a
young
man
visits
a
great
deal
at
a
house
where
there
are
did
not
know
that
said
edgar
with
a
simplicity
which
went
to
lady
heart
believe
he
is
as
innocent
as
a
baby
she
said
afterwards
when
she
was
telling
the
story
may
be
as
innocent
as
he
pleases
but
he
trifle
with
gussy
said
harry
putting
on
a
very
valiant
air
gussy
for
her
own
part
did
not
know
what
to
think
likes
me
very
well
but
that
is
all
she
said
to
her
mother
am
sure
he
means
nothing
indeed
mamma
i
am
quite
sure
think
you
know
anything
at
all
about
it
said
lady
augusta
with
some
irritation
for
edgar
was
her
own
it
was
she
who
had
vouched
for
him
and
settled
how
everything
was
to
be
and
not
only
her
pride
but
her
feelings
were
concerned
she
thought
she
had
never
met
with
any
one
she
could
like
so
well
for
a
he
was
so
thoughtful
so
considerate
and
a
matter
which
is
well
worth
noting
had
the
air
of
liking
her
too
for
herself
as
well
as
for
her
daughter
could
make
a
son
of
him
the
poor
lady
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
for
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
sometimes
sadly
in
want
of
a
good
son
to
help
her
the
girls
were
very
good
but
they
were
only
girls
and
could
not
be
of
all
the
use
a
man
could
and
harry
was
quite
as
much
trouble
as
comfort
and
thornleigh
left
everything
to
his
wife
therefore
she
was
reluctant
to
give
up
the
idea
of
edgar
which
was
as
we
have
said
her
own
idea
it
was
so
seldom
that
everything
that
could
be
desired
was
to
be
found
united
in
one
person
as
in
his
case
when
a
man
was
very
and
a
comfort
to
talk
to
the
chances
were
he
was
poor
and
had
to
be
snubbed
instead
of
encouraged
but
edgar
was
everything
that
was
desirable
even
down
to
his
very
local
position
so
lady
augusta
spoke
very
sharply
even
to
her
favourite
daughter
when
she
insinuated
that
edgar
was
indifferent
know
anything
at
all
about
it
was
what
she
said
and
she
clung
to
the
idea
with
a
certain
desperation
arden
was
so
near
and
the
family
was
so
good
and
the
so
satisfactory
and
the
man
so
nice
it
was
impossible
to
improve
the
combination
which
she
found
in
him
and
lady
mind
was
fully
made
up
to
brave
a
great
deal
and
do
a
great
deal
before
she
relinquished
the
prize
which
providence
had
thrown
in
her
way
chapter
xxiii
edgar
left
the
thornleighs
that
day
with
several
quite
new
subjects
of
thought
his
heart
was
touched
to
the
very
quick
by
that
little
revelation
which
gussy
had
made
to
him
of
her
history
it
stopped
him
quite
suddenly
in
the
current
of
his
previous
reflections
he
had
been
so
full
of
the
unprofitableness
and
unmeaningness
of
the
new
existence
into
which
he
found
himself
thrown
that
the
discovery
of
a
tragedy
so
simple
and
so
hopeless
just
one
step
out
of
it
upset
once
more
all
his
conclusions
the
idea
he
had
been
forming
was
that
within
the
range
of
strong
feeling
of
any
kind
much
less
passion
was
impossible
even
suffering
and
death
seemed
things
too
great
and
too
human
to
penetrate
within
that
artificial
ring
he
could
have
imagined
the
same
routine
going
on
for
ever
and
ever
without
any
novelty
in
it
or
touch
of
the
real
yet
here
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
eternal
dance
here
was
a
single
silent
figure
who
had
suffered
as
edgar
felt
in
the
fervour
of
youthful
sympathy
the
extremity
of
human
woe
how
strange
it
was
the
contrast
confused
him
and
gave
another
turn
as
it
were
to
his
whirling
brain
they
were
then
human
creatures
after
all
those
people
of
fashion
whirling
on
and
on
in
their
everlasting
round
sometimes
pain
passion
disappointment
tragical
rending
asunder
of
hearts
and
lives
proved
their
real
nature
perhaps
even
the
man
who
was
trying
to
take
all
the
use
out
of
his
life
by
means
of
engagements
twenty
deep
had
been
pierced
through
and
through
with
some
such
shaft
as
that
which
had
killed
poor
lover
perhaps
some
of
those
women
who
hurried
from
one
assemblage
to
another
as
fast
as
hours
and
horses
could
carry
them
had
suffered
in
silence
all
that
ada
had
done
and
lost
all
savour
and
sweetness
in
life
like
her
edgar
felt
himself
pulled
up
short
and
paused
in
his
wholesale
criticisms
how
could
he
tell
how
could
any
one
tell
what
lay
underneath
the
surface
of
the
stream
he
paused
and
then
he
went
off
at
a
tangent
as
young
philosophers
are
apt
to
do
and
asked
himself
whether
this
flutter
and
crowding
and
universal
buzz
of
amusement
was
not
a
vast
pretence
adopted
by
common
consent
to
hide
what
everybody
was
suffering
underneath
outside
an
attempt
to
appear
as
if
they
were
having
things
their
own
way
enjoying
to
the
height
of
their
capacity
all
the
good
the
world
could
give
but
underneath
a
deep
universal
conviction
that
life
was
naught
and
happiness
a
dream
was
this
the
true
theory
of
life
the
question
occupied
him
a
great
deal
more
perhaps
than
the
readers
of
this
history
will
sympathise
with
but
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
was
all
very
new
to
him
and
that
every
novel
phase
of
life
strikes
us
more
strongly
than
that
to
which
we
are
accustomed
to
arthur
arden
for
instance
the
course
of
existence
which
startled
edgar
was
too
common
to
call
for
a
single
question
it
was
the
ordinary
state
of
affairs
to
him
but
edgar
knew
the
other
forms
so
much
better
he
understood
those
conditions
under
which
a
man
labours
that
he
may
live
that
theory
was
familiar
to
him
which
makes
the
work
necessary
to
the
day
but
to
exist
in
order
to
get
rid
of
your
existence
to
bend
all
your
faculties
to
the
question
not
how
you
are
to
provide
for
but
how
you
are
to
spend
and
dispose
of
your
days
that
was
new
to
him
and
therefore
he
puzzled
over
it
in
a
way
which
a
man
of
fashion
to
the
manner
born
could
not
possibly
understand
the
man
of
fashion
would
probably
have
been
quite
as
much
astonished
and
amazed
by
prejudices
in
favour
of
something
to
do
something
to
do
why
harry
thornleigh
had
a
hundred
things
to
do
and
never
a
moment
to
spare
and
yet
had
never
been
of
use
either
to
himself
or
any
other
living
creature
all
his
life
and
then
this
new
theory
about
what
was
expected
of
young
men
who
visited
in
houses
where
there
were
girls
troubled
edgar
much
the
other
question
occupied
his
intelligence
but
this
one
disturbed
him
in
a
tenderer
point
it
hurt
his
in
the
first
place
for
to
suppose
you
have
been
a
favourite
in
a
house
on
your
own
merits
and
then
to
find
that
you
are
only
encouraged
with
a
view
of
providing
for
a
daughter
is
sadly
humbling
to
a
young
vanity
and
it
hurt
him
in
the
affectionate
respect
he
had
for
women
in
general
and
the
thornleighs
in
particular
he
liked
them
all
so
kindly
and
so
truly
and
had
been
so
pleased
to
believe
that
they
liked
him
whereas
apparently
it
was
only
on
the
chance
that
he
should
bestow
what
he
had
upon
one
of
them
that
they
admitted
him
so
freely
what
a
disenchantment
it
was
instead
of
being
their
friend
whom
they
had
confidence
in
he
was
a
man
who
like
arthur
arden
a
man
whose
inclinations
were
speculated
upon
and
his
indifference
despised
edgar
asked
himself
with
a
certain
bitterness
which
of
them
it
was
whom
he
was
expected
to
address
perhaps
the
stately
helena
notwithstanding
her
views
about
the
occupations
of
women
had
been
given
to
understand
that
it
was
her
duty
to
accept
arden
instead
perhaps
gussy
but
edgar
could
not
help
feeling
sore
on
this
subject
he
was
fond
of
gussy
he
said
to
himself
she
was
so
frank
and
so
friendly
and
so
sympathetic
so
ready
to
respond
so
willing
to
communicate
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
that
she
had
been
making
merchandise
of
him
and
calculating
upon
arden
for
of
course
it
is
arden
not
me
he
thought
i
for
myself
am
nobody
less
a
great
deal
than
the
poor
fellow
who
died
whom
they
seem
to
have
had
a
kind
of
human
feeling
for
she
cried
over
him
even
and
laughed
and
said
i
meant
nothing
edgar
added
in
a
sudden
flush
of
pique
and
dissatisfaction
what
meaning
i
wonder
did
she
intend
me
to
have
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
edgar
arden
was
not
in
love
was
not
the
least
in
love
but
yet
did
not
care
that
gussy
should
think
of
him
as
an
article
of
merchandise
a
creature
representing
settlements
and
a
house
of
her
own
it
is
a
humiliating
position
for
a
man
to
find
himself
in
it
is
pleasant
perhaps
to
be
the
object
of
pursuit
and
to
feel
that
mothers
and
daughters
are
fluttered
by
your
entrance
or
exit
or
by
any
silly
word
it
may
be
your
pleasure
to
address
to
the
young
women
who
are
being
put
up
to
market
but
even
to
those
young
women
who
are
put
up
to
market
the
transaction
is
scarcely
so
humbling
as
it
is
to
the
man
who
is
reckoned
among
them
not
as
a
man
at
all
but
as
so
much
money
so
many
lands
so
many
luxuries
edgar
was
cast
down
by
this
revelation
down
to
the
very
depths
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
think
they
liked
was
he
worth
liking
by
anybody
was
he
not
rather
an
insignificant
wretch
unworthy
the
least
notice
on
his
own
merits
and
he
did
not
in
the
least
desire
to
be
noticed
for
the
sake
of
arden
it
seemed
to
him
the
very
last
depth
of
contempt
for
a
few
days
after
this
edgar
went
about
very
sadly
abstaining
from
everybody
and
feeling
very
much
like
a
culprit
he
kept
away
from
lady
pleasant
house
and
that
did
not
make
him
any
the
happier
and
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
thought
in
the
odious
jargon
of
to
be
to
gussy
a
thought
which
stung
him
so
that
he
seized
his
hat
and
rushed
out
to
call
meaning
he
knew
not
what
perhaps
to
ask
her
piteously
if
she
really
wanted
arden
and
to
offer
it
to
her
acceptance
but
the
room
was
full
of
visitors
and
gussy
took
very
little
notice
of
him
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
how
small
he
felt
how
impertinent
and
presumptuous
but
still
the
thought
came
back
it
is
usual
to
take
it
for
granted
that
only
one
or
two
of
the
greater
and
more
primitive
sentiments
are
concerned
in
that
great
act
of
marriage
which
is
so
important
a
matter
for
good
or
for
evil
in
human
life
people
marry
for
love
which
is
the
natural
motive
or
they
marry
for
money
or
equivalent
comfort
advancement
and
advantageous
development
of
life
and
no
doubt
it
is
very
true
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
these
are
the
feelings
which
are
most
involved
but
yet
it
is
astonishing
how
many
secondary
motives
come
in
to
determine
the
most
momentous
of
personal
decisions
edgar
arden
had
never
experienced
a
he
had
thought
himself
in
love
two
or
three
times
in
his
life
and
he
knew
that
he
had
got
over
the
feeling
it
was
a
thing
he
was
ashamed
of
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
but
nevertheless
it
was
quite
true
that
he
had
got
over
it
he
had
just
skimmed
the
surface
of
those
emotions
which
culminate
in
the
kind
of
love
which
is
for
ever
at
the
moment
he
had
thought
himself
deeply
moved
but
afterwards
with
mingled
amusement
and
shame
he
had
confessed
to
himself
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
passing
ripple
which
had
gone
over
him
perhaps
he
was
not
of
a
passionate
nature
nor
one
who
would
be
subject
to
any
tragic
force
of
feeling
his
love
would
be
tender
and
deep
and
true
but
it
would
not
be
wild
or
and
he
was
a
man
who
would
be
capable
of
considering
the
interests
of
the
woman
he
loved
apart
from
himself
which
is
a
kind
of
generosity
sometimes
not
at
all
appreciated
by
the
object
of
such
affection
perhaps
on
the
whole
the
most
real
lover
the
one
most
attractive
to
a
woman
is
the
selfish
man
who
wants
her
for
his
own
happiness
and
will
have
her
whatever
the
obstacles
may
be
rather
than
the
disinterested
man
who
prizes
her
happiness
most
and
sacrifices
himself
and
lets
her
go
not
sufficiently
realising
perhaps
that
he
has
sacrificed
her
too
but
the
absence
of
this
impassioned
selfishness
on
part
laid
him
open
to
the
action
of
all
the
secondary
motives
never
did
there
exist
a
more
friendly
affectionate
soul
he
would
have
put
himself
to
trouble
to
procure
what
it
wanted
for
any
child
he
heard
crying
by
the
way
it
came
natural
to
him
as
it
comes
natural
to
some
men
by
hook
or
by
crook
to
secure
their
own
advantage
and
if
it
really
should
be
the
case
that
he
himself
or
rather
arden
of
arden
was
a
thing
that
gussy
thornleigh
wanted
very
much
and
would
be
the
happier
for
why
should
not
she
have
it
the
idea
was
a
little
absurd
and
yet
he
could
not
bring
forward
a
single
sufficient
reason
why
it
should
not
be
so
actually
when
he
considered
the
matter
fully
he
had
no
personal
objections
she
would
be
a
very
sweet
very
bright
little
companion
not
a
fault
could
be
found
with
her
in
any
way
nay
edgar
was
too
chivalrous
to
discuss
gussy
or
any
other
woman
in
this
irreverent
manner
what
he
meant
to
himself
was
rather
that
any
man
might
be
proud
and
happy
to
have
such
a
wife
and
he
had
no
other
love
to
stand
between
him
and
her
no
no
other
love
except
that
visionary
love
whom
every
young
man
looks
to
find
somewhere
the
una
of
imagination
the
perfect
woman
she
only
and
no
other
and
she
was
no
rival
no
doubt
she
would
fold
her
wings
and
drop
down
out
of
the
skies
and
shadow
over
and
melt
into
the
being
of
wife
therefore
if
gussy
chose
why
should
not
this
be
but
perhaps
he
was
just
as
glad
that
he
had
not
been
allowed
a
possibility
of
committing
himself
it
was
not
his
fault
he
would
have
done
it
had
he
been
alone
with
her
or
even
had
he
been
able
to
get
her
to
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
apart
from
immediate
observation
but
that
had
been
impossible
and
consequently
it
was
providence
not
edgar
which
had
kept
it
from
coming
to
pass
yet
he
was
not
sorry
he
reflected
philosophically
that
there
was
plenty
of
time
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
he
felt
sure
any
more
than
he
was
in
love
with
her
she
was
not
in
any
hurry
she
was
a
dear
good
reasonable
girl
in
short
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
came
to
see
that
apart
from
romance
which
was
always
absurd
nothing
could
be
more
appropriate
in
every
way
they
were
made
for
each
other
they
were
neither
of
them
solemn
passionate
people
they
were
both
lively
cheerful
fond
of
a
little
movement
and
commotion
and
yet
fond
of
the
country
and
of
a
reasonable
life
with
duty
and
responsibility
in
it
gussy
alas
thought
very
little
had
he
but
known
it
of
duty
and
responsibility
but
this
was
how
the
matter
shaped
itself
in
mind
of
course
there
was
no
need
for
anything
being
decided
in
a
hurry
clare
would
probably
marry
first
or
if
not
wishes
must
be
supreme
whatever
they
were
she
would
live
with
them
at
arden
she
would
still
be
mistress
no
that
was
perhaps
impossible
at
all
events
she
would
still
be
here
edgar
found
himself
in
deep
waters
and
stuck
fast
not
quite
making
out
how
this
was
to
be
settled
clare
in
arden
and
not
mistress
of
arden
was
impossible
no
doubt
had
his
feelings
been
very
deeply
concerned
he
would
not
have
been
deterred
by
such
a
thought
but
as
it
was
chiefly
for
other
satisfaction
that
he
was
planning
the
arrangement
it
was
a
very
serious
drawback
what
please
gussy
at
the
cost
of
clare
this
was
the
most
grave
obstacle
to
the
plan
which
had
yet
come
in
his
way
he
was
still
in
this
perplexity
and
not
without
a
consciousness
of
its
whimsical
character
when
he
received
letter
there
was
something
strained
and
strange
in
its
expression
which
struck
him
curiously
why
should
she
write
to
him
so
of
course
she
might
ask
anything
of
him
call
him
to
her
as
she
pleased
to
make
a
journey
from
london
to
lancashire
was
not
much
a
great
deal
farther
to
the
end
of
the
world
had
she
wished
it
he
would
have
gone
willingly
for
his
sister
he
wrote
her
a
little
note
full
of
affectionate
playful
reproach
i
have
a
hundred
things
to
do
he
said
i
am
engaged
to
go
to
twenty
balls
and
ten
dinners
and
three
concerts
and
seventeen
afternoon
teas
in
the
course
of
the
next
four
days
yet
i
will
hurry
through
the
most
pressing
of
my
engagements
and
come
home
on
but
the
meaning
of
the
letter
was
not
in
the
least
the
thing
that
struck
him
she
wanted
to
consult
him
about
something
that
was
all
he
made
of
it
and
as
for
the
manner
of
expression
clare
was
in
haste
or
she
was
annoyed
about
something
or
perhaps
a
little
out
of
temper
now
and
then
clare
could
be
a
little
out
of
temper
he
knew
perhaps
the
village
people
had
been
troublesome
perhaps
it
had
vexed
her
that
arthur
arden
should
be
staying
with
the
pimpernels
but
on
the
whole
haste
was
the
most
natural
explanation
thus
he
settled
the
matter
with
himself
with
very
little
difficulty
and
on
the
whole
he
was
very
glad
to
be
called
home
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
all
at
once
that
the
thornleighs
were
going
on
monday
and
then
surely
and
beyond
all
question
fate
must
have
decided
this
matter
for
him
his
summons
had
come
to
him
at
such
a
moment
and
in
such
a
way
that
he
be
supposed
to
be
following
the
thornleighs
home
as
he
had
been
supposed
to
follow
them
to
town
he
could
not
but
laugh
as
he
perceived
this
new
complication
now
indeed
unless
he
took
pains
to
show
that
he
did
mean
something
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
said
gussy
was
badly
treated
when
he
went
into
the
solemn
shades
of
the
minerva
to
seek
lord
newmarch
with
whom
he
had
some
business
he
felt
already
sure
what
would
be
said
to
him
home
on
saturday
said
the
politician
before
the
education
debate
which
i
so
much
wanted
you
to
hear
arden
i
suppose
it
is
clear
enough
to
see
what
that
means
but
must
you
go
because
they
go
though
you
are
not
in
parliament
you
have
a
duty
to
the
public
too
go
because
i
am
called
home
on
business
said
edgar
no
other
reason
i
assure
you
i
have
heard
from
clare
ah
said
lord
newmarch
course
we
all
understand
urgent
private
affairs
but
arden
though
it
does
not
become
me
to
speak
i
wish
you
had
not
meant
to
marry
immediately
i
should
be
more
happy
to
congratulate
you
as
member
for
east
lancashire
than
as
benedict
the
married
chances
are
you
will
never
congratulate
me
as
either
said
edgar
with
a
certain
wayward
pathos
which
puzzled
himself
am
not
going
to
marry
and
i
intend
to
go
into
parliament
i
should
not
be
much
credit
to
you
in
that
way
i
should
go
in
for
impracticable
measures
and
call
a
spade
a
spade
let
me
tame
down
first
and
get
used
to
parliamentary
language
and
all
the
other
fictions
of
life
dear
fellow
i
wish
you
were
not
so
bitter
about
the
fictions
of
life
said
lord
newmarch
shaking
his
head
said
edgar
with
a
laugh
if
not
bitter
cynical
cynical
perhaps
that
is
a
better
word
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
what
you
said
the
other
day
and
i
think
there
is
much
in
it
society
must
be
kept
up
some
sacrifice
must
be
made
to
keep
up
that
fine
atmosphere
that
air
so
sensitive
to
everything
that
comes
into
it
that
brilliant
witty
refined
said
another
young
man
lounging
up
were
you
that
one
see

at
the
dance
the
other
night
awful
bore
never
was
at
anything
much
worse
all
my
life
the
women
all
frights
and
the
men
all
notabilities
ah
arden
i
never
see
you
anywhere
now
where
has
the
arden
gone
arthur
arden
that
one
used
to
meet
about
he
used
to
be
always
with
the
lowestofts
lowestoft
stand
it
at
the
last
deuced
bore
some
men
are
insufferable
in
that
way
pull
you
up
short
whether
you
mean
anything
or
not
and
spoil
the
whole
affair
been
doing
anything
in
the
house
education
bill
and
that
sort
of
thing
hang
education
what
is
the
good
of
it
what
has
it
ever
done
for
you
or
me
indeed
cried
edgar
a
backing
which
was
received
with
the
warmth
it
merited
and
christchurch
are
reckoned
pretty
well
said
their
new
companion
i
know
what
they
ever
did
for
me
and
as
for
those
confounded
fellows
that
never
wash
and
have
votes
what
do
they
want
with
it
depend
upon
it
they
are
a
great
deal
better
without
teaches
them
to
be
discontented
then
teaches
you
to
humbug
and
tell
lies
for
them
to
read
in
the
newspapers
by
the
way
where
are
you
going
got
some
men
coming
to
dine
with
me
will
you
make
one
or
rather
will
you
make
two
if
arden
likes
then
there
is
that
deuced
affair
on
at
the
which
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
look
in
upon
and
the
chromatics
are
giving
a
grand
concert
with
squallini
and
whiskerando
little
squallini
is
worth
listening
to
i
can
tell
you
there
are
heaps
of
things
i
never
attempt
and
one
is
going
to
musical
nights
promiscuous
not
knowing
what
to
hear
but
the
chromatics
know
what
is
what
going
i
shall
look
out
somebody
and
have
a
rubber
till
five
these
concerts
and
things
are
a
confounded
that
your
brilliant
witty
refined
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
we
should
make
a
sacrifice
to
keep
up
said
edgar
as
they
went
out
together
an
amount
of
trouble
it
has
taken
to
produce
him
and
now
he
has
to
be
kept
up
at
a
sacrifice
i
should
prefer
to
make
a
sacrifice
to
get
rid
of
him
newmarch
he
is
not
so
witty
as
his
own
groom
nor
half
so
useful
as
that
crossing
sweeper
would
find
the
dull
too
if
you
met
him
every
day
said
newmarch
fact
is
it
is
not
a
very
good
world
but
it
is
the
best
we
can
get
and
if
a
man
does
as
much
as
he
can
with
it
you
must
get
into
the
house
arden
i
mean
to
say
society
is
enough
for
an
energetic
man
with
a
great
deal
of
time
on
his
hands
but
my
occupations
i
hope
are
solid
enough
i
have
had
three
or
four
hours
of
committees
already
and
i
am
going
down
to
westminster
straight
of
course
it
is
pleasant
to
sit
over
that
little
table
in
the
corner
of
the
ah
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
for
me
said
the
legislator
with
a
sigh
and
edgar
laughed
partly
at
his
friend
partly
at
himself
partly
at
the
universal
vanity
lord
newmarch
was
no
solomon
the
country
could
have
gone
on
all
the
same
had
he
too
gossiped
over
a
as
so
many
of
the
youth
of
england
were
doing
at
that
moment
with
relish
as
great
as
though
they
had
been
so
many
and
tongues
sharpened
at
the
clubs
england
would
not
have
suffered
had
lord
newmarch
gossiped
too
and
edgar
was
not
much
more
genuine
as
he
walked
with
him
as
far
as
berkeley
square
and
then
dropped
off
say
to
the
thornleighs
leaving
the
liveliest
certainty
on
lord
mind
as
to
what
were
his
relations
with
the
family
nor
perhaps
was
gussy
more
true
as
she
sat
and
filled
out
the
tea
and
saw
with
a
little
thrill
the
man
coming
in
who
was
to
fix
her
fate
she
did
not
love
him
any
more
than
he
loved
her
and
yet
in
all
likelihood
her
life
was
in
his
hands
what
a
strange
aimless
whirl
it
was
in
which
everybody
moved
or
seemed
to
move
as
some
blind
fate
required
and
could
not
stop
themselves
nor
change
the
current
which
kept
drifting
them
on
the
was
the
braver
and
the
more
genuine
personage
the
mud
cleared
away
before
his
broom
the
road
grew
passable
where
he
moved
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
make
a
new
passage
wherever
he
was
so
minded
at
least
so
one
supposed
looking
at
his
mystery
from
outside
perhaps
within
the
guild
of
has
its
tyrannical
limitations
too
chapter
xxiv
it
was
a
quiet
hour
when
edgar
made
his
appearance
in
the
at
berkeley
square
why
this
afternoon
should
have
been
so
still
and
domestic
and
the
last
so
noisy
and
full
of
visitors
it
is
difficult
to
say
the
girls
had
been
riding
in
the
park
in
the
morning
last
ride
as
the
younger
ones
informed
him
with
voluble
regret
the
horses
were
going
off
that
evening
the
whole
house
was
as
it
were
breaking
to
pieces
already
half
the
pretty
things
the
stands
of
books
and
of
flowers
had
disappeared
from
the
tables
the
girls
looked
somehow
as
if
their
very
dresses
were
plainer
which
was
not
actually
the
case
the
cloud
upon
them
was
only
a
moral
cloud
consequent
upon
the
knowledge
that
on
monday
they
were
all
going
home
fancy
the
opera
will
go
on
all
the
same
and
patti
will
sing
though
we
are
away
said
mary
who
was
musical
will
be
just
as
many
dances
every
night
and
all
night
long
and
we
at
thorne
cried
beatrice
gussy
who
looked
down
upon
them
both
from
the
altitude
of
two
and
twenty
shook
her
head
with
a
certain
grandeur
of
superior
experience
you
silly
girls
if
you
had
seen
as
much
of
it
as
i
have
the
opera
is
all
very
well
and
so
are
the
dances
but
you
know
how
tiresome
they
get
when
you
go
on
and
on
yes
it
is
my
fourth
season
arden
and
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
be
lady
augusta
gave
her
daughter
a
warning
look
more
seasons
you
can
count
the
less
disposed
you
will
be
to
speak
so
very
frankly
of
them
she
said
arden
has
been
too
much
with
us
not
to
know
what
a
chatterbox
you
said
edgar
good
it
has
been
of
you
to
let
me
be
so
much
with
you
it
has
made
town
so
much
more
pleasant
to
me
than
it
could
have
been
otherwise
and
now
i
have
come
to
bid
you
though
i
am
glad
to
think
it
will
not
be
for
bid
us
they
all
cried
with
surprise
and
lady
augusta
cast
another
significant
glance
over
the
heads
of
mary
and
beatrice
who
were
too
heedless
to
take
any
notice
at
the
daughter
whose
interests
were
more
specially
concerned
said
edgar
has
written
begging
me
to
go
to
her
directly
i
am
going
on
saturday
i
had
no
idea
of
it
when
i
saw
you
yesterday
and
after
all
i
shall
be
in
lancashire
before
you
are
i
even
know
why
it
is
i
am
sent
for
by
my
sovereign
once
more
a
look
passed
between
lady
augusta
and
her
elder
girls
they
did
not
believe
one
word
of
this
story
they
took
it
quite
simply
for
granted
that
he
was
doing
this
to
be
near
them
to
be
within
reach
of
gussy
gussy
herself
even
was
convinced
she
had
doubted
and
shaken
her
head
when
the
entire
household
had
been
persuaded
of
the
fact
but
now
a
little
flush
of
gratification
lighted
up
her
cheeks
she
could
no
longer
resist
the
conviction
that
his
coming
and
going
depended
somehow
as
she
said
modestly
to
herself
on
is
strange
of
clare
to
send
you
such
a
summons
said
lady
augusta
i
daresay
she
is
very
lonely
poor
child
i
do
hope
we
shall
see
a
great
deal
more
of
her
at
thorne
when
we
get
home
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
very
glad
you
are
going
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
her
still
in
mourning
as
she
is
and
left
in
that
house
all
i
have
been
a
little
forgetful
of
clare
i
fear
edgar
said
without
thought
and
the
girls
who
were
now
very
attentive
made
another
rapid
comment
within
themselves
all
in
a
breath
he
has
been
thinking
so
much
of
gussy
how
funny
it
was
how
nice
to
be
gussy
for
whose
sake
a
man
all
his
duties
a
little
thrill
of
interest
ran
through
the
assembled
family
and
even
kind
lady
augusta
who
had
become
as
she
herself
said
to
edgar
was
a
little
moved
by
the
thought
of
what
might
be
coming
are
never
forgetful
of
anybody
i
am
sure
she
said
with
a
very
strong
motive
i
like
to
praise
people
to
their
faces
but
i
never
saw
any
one
less
apt
to
think
of
himself
than
edgar
made
no
reply
to
this
praise
there
was
a
little
pause
of
expectation
an
occasional
hush
in
the
room
which
one
and
another
attempted
to
break
by
snatches
of
conversation
perpetually
interrupted
they
expect
me
to
make
the
plunge
before
them
all
edgar
mused
to
himself
with
a
sense
of
fun
which
was
very
inappropriate
to
the
gravity
of
the
position
and
after
all
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
make
this
plunge
what
could
he
say
gussy
and
he
had
been
upon
the
easiest
the
friendliest
terms
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
alter
that
ground
all
at
once
and
assume
a
vein
of
high
sentiment
there
was
in
reality
so
little
sentiment
in
his
mind
he
was
not
impassioned
and
it
occurred
to
him
all
at
once
that
to
ask
a
girl
to
marry
him
in
this
perfectly
calm
and
humdrum
way
would
not
be
flattering
to
the
girl
gussy
no
doubt
would
expect
something
very
different
she
would
expect
a
fervour
the
excitement
of
a
man
whose
happiness
for
life
depended
on
her
yea
or
nay
and
edgar
felt
that
his
happiness
did
not
depend
upon
it
altogether
it
was
an
embarrassing
position
conversation
languished
in
the
thornleigh
and
the
family
gave
furtive
glances
at
him
and
tried
to
look
indifferent
and
betrayed
itself
as
for
gussy
she
never
looked
at
him
at
all
she
had
given
up
her
though
she
still
sat
at
the
table
with
the
tray
before
her
which
was
a
fortunate
shield
but
her
eyes
were
bent
upon
her
work
and
she
was
as
silent
as
a
mouse
in
her
corner
conscious
to
her
and
expectant
too
it
was
a
relief
when
old
lady
vere
came
in
and
her
daughters
who
were
much
of
the
same
age
as
mary
and
beatrice
and
instantly
drew
off
the
attention
of
those
two
young
women
lady
vere
too
kept
lady
augusta
in
occupation
and
had
something
to
say
to
helena
so
that
when
edgar
brought
her
cup
back
to
the
it
was
quite
natural
that
he
should
glide
into
the
vacant
chair
and
keep
gussy
company
you
sorry
to
leave
town
he
said
and
gussy
gave
a
shy
blushing
trustful
glance
into
his
face
which
made
him
draw
his
chair
a
little
closer
he
fond
of
her
not
impassioned
but
yet
what
a
dear
little
girl
she
was
for
some
things
gussy
said
not
so
sorry
as
mary
and
beatrice
are
first
season
is
always
delightful
one
feels
as
if
it
would
all
last
for
you
i
think
i
have
that
feeling
too
but
only
because
it
is
so
dreary
so
flat
so
always
the
same
thing
over
again
said
edgar
think
life
must
be
waiting
for
us
real
life
not
this
dull
routine
at
perhaps
said
gussy
faintly
for
every
word
he
said
seemed
to
be
more
and
more
weighted
with
meaning
he
did
not
say
absolutely
real
life
i
speak
of
is
our
life
together
the
existence
in
which
we
two
shall
be
one
but
could
anything
be
more
clear
than
that
he
meant
it
so
her
voice
sank
in
spite
of
herself
gussy
was
not
in
the
least
impassioned
either
but
what
she
thought
was
dearly
he
must
love
me
to
be
able
to
give
up
town
and
everything
for
my
sake
poor
dear
boy
that
is
all
he
is
thinking
of
and
oh
i
am
not
so
good
as
he
is
i
am
thinking
of
a
great
many
other
things
besides
thus
with
the
very
best
motives
in
the
world
they
went
on
deceiving
each
other
not
much
was
said
over
the
except
such
broken
scraps
of
talk
as
this
talk
which
meant
next
to
nothing
and
yet
was
supposed
by
the
listeners
on
both
sides
to
mean
a
great
deal
is
anxious
to
get
back
to
her
schools
and
her
poor
people
gussy
said
is
so
good
she
has
done
nothing
but
work
for
the
children
even
here
people
ought
to
be
happy
you
think
that
give
themselves
up
like
that
and
think
only
of
others
they
must
get
to
be
happy
because
they
are
so
hope
so
said
edgar
with
a
certain
doubtfulness
above
all
those
who
are
more
happy
should
be
good
to
her
one
like
her
seems
a
sacrifice
for
others
securing
their
happiness
i
mean
i
know
what
you
mean
said
gussy
clasping
her
hands
indeed
it
is
no
trouble
to
be
good
to
ada
we
all
love
her
so
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
it
would
be
wicked
to
be
very
happy
while
she
sits
there
and
they
both
turned
to
look
at
the
sister
who
sat
cheerful
in
the
corner
making
little
frocks
she
was
laughing
at
the
moment
showing
one
of
the
miss
veres
how
to
shape
a
little
sleeve
gussy
who
believed
herself
to
stand
on
the
very
threshold
of
so
different
a
world
felt
her
heart
overflow
with
love
and
compassion
ada
she
said
to
herself
only
schools
and
poor
frocks
for
ada
while
she
herself
was
to
have
every
delight
feelings
were
different
if
circumstances
were
so
to
arrange
themselves
as
that
he
should
be
brother
he
would
be
very
good
to
her
she
would
find
in
him
a
friend
who
would
never
alter
who
would
stand
by
her
steadily
doing
all
that
brother
could
do
to
make
her
lonely
path
more
easy
involuntarily
there
rose
before
edgar
the
vision
of
an
with
new
interests
in
it
and
new
duties
a
new
race
of
ardens
curiously
different
from
the
old
a
warm
household
place
for
ada
and
for
everybody
a
centre
of
domestic
kindness
that
was
what
the
house
of
a
country
gentleman
the
natural
head
of
a
community
ought
to
be
he
smiled
over
the
imagination
and
yet
it
came
naturally
and
pleasantly
to
his
mind
gussy
who
was
not
more
than
a
pretty
girl
now
would
be
the
sweetest
kindest
most
charming
matron
like
her
own
mother
but
younger
and
prettier
and
more
sweet
and
the
house
would
be
full
of
pleasant
tumult
and
society
he
did
not
quite
clearly
identify
himself
but
that
was
perhaps
because
of
the
laugh
that
gradually
broadened
in
his
eyes
at
the
thought
and
to
think
that
this
arose
simply
out
of
face
in
the
corner
and
the
impulse
of
making
life
brighter
for
her
then
he
roused
up
and
saw
that
gussy
was
looking
the
same
way
and
that
her
pretty
eyes
were
full
of
tears
how
sweet
and
good
and
she
was
they
were
women
whom
a
man
could
trust
his
honour
and
happiness
to
without
a
doubt
or
fear
never
surely
was
there
a
stranger
wooing
when
their
eyes
met
gussy
blushed
and
so
did
edgar
had
they
both
been
seeing
in
a
vision
the
house
that
was
not
yet
the
unborn
faces
the
unlighted
fire
but
then
more
visitors
came
in
and
more
tea
was
wanted
and
nothing
decisive
could
be
said
then
and
there
suppose
you
are
going
to
the
lady
augusta
said
as
he
took
leave
of
her
for
she
too
saw
clearly
that
nothing
could
possibly
be
settled
in
the
under
the
eyes
of
all
the
family
it
need
not
be
yet
of
course
we
shall
see
you
and
thus
everything
drew
on
towards
the
evident
termination
if
edgar
had
been
consulted
on
the
subject
before
hand
he
would
have
said
that
to
enact
his
love
drama
or
at
least
its
decisive
scene
at
a
ball
would
have
been
the
very
last
thing
in
the
world
he
was
likely
to
do
just
as
it
would
have
seemed
absolutely
impossible
to
him
had
he
foreseen
it
to
forestall
love
in
the
way
which
he
was
doing
and
put
affection
in
its
place
but
he
did
not
seem
to
have
any
will
of
his
own
at
all
in
the
matter
he
was
pleasantly
drawn
on
by
a
tide
which
carried
him
towards
gussy
which
made
her
inevitable
and
his
position
unmistakeable
not
only
was
it
expected
of
him
but
he
expected
himself
to
take
this
step
the
only
thing
he
was
doubtful
of
was
how
to
do
it
he
could
not
possibly
say
to
a
girl
so
charming
and
worthy
of
all
homage
that
he
was
very
fond
of
her
and
yet
did
not
love
her
in
the
least
as
a
lover
should
if
he
did
it
would
be
an
insult
not
such
a
lovesuit
as
could
be
accepted
therefore
he
would
be
obliged
to
put
aside
his
true
feeling
and
produce
an
utterly
false
one
out
of
compliment
to
her
and
how
was
he
to
do
it
all
the
rest
he
could
do
willingly
pleasantly
with
perfect
consent
of
his
mind
and
affections
but
how
was
he
to
be
false
to
her
to
pretend
to
feelings
which
were
not
his
this
occupied
his
mind
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
gave
him
the
greatest
possible
trouble
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
evident
that
the
crisis
had
come
and
that
he
must
speak
he
sent
her
a
bouquet
as
the
first
step
which
was
very
easy
and
pleasant
if
it
had
been
diamonds
and
rubies
instead
of
flowers
he
would
have
done
it
with
still
greater
goodwill
he
would
give
her
anything
everything
arden
itself
and
his
liberty
and
his
life
but
how
was
he
to
get
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
excitement
and
offer
her
his
heart
chapter
xxv
the
ball
was
a
very
nice
ball
everybody
said
there
were
a
great
many
people
there
indeed
everybody
was
there
the
stairs
were
crowded
and
all
the
passages
and
the
dancers
had
scarcely
room
to
move
to
make
your
way
up
or
down
was
almost
as
bad
as
going
to
court
the
way
in
which
trains
were
damaged
and
trimmings
torn
off
would
have
tried
the
temper
of
a
saint
nevertheless
the
ladies
bore
it
like
heroines
smiling
blandly
and
protesting
that
it
did
not
matter
even
at
the
moment
when
their
most
cherished
lace
was
being
rent
under
their
eyes
the
mistress
of
the
house
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
ready
to
drop
with
exhaustion
but
grinning
horribly
a
ghastly
smile
at
everybody
who
approached
her
a
royal
duke
had
come
in
for
and
a
german
prince
whom
all
the
lowestofts
and
all
their
friends
treated
with
supreme
contempt
when
they
spoke
of
him
but
yet
of
the
were
too
proud
and
happy
to
see
at
their
ball
edgar
arden
was
one
of
those
who
traversed
the
crowd
with
the
least
but
he
could
not
refrain
from
making
those
remarks
upon
it
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
concerning
the
natural
history
and
habits
of
the
world
of
fashion
edgar
remarked
that
only
a
very
few
people
looked
really
happy
and
these
were
either
the
men
and
women
who
had
some
special
love
affair
innocent
or
otherwise
on
hand
and
had
been
able
to
appropriate
the
individual
who
interested
them
with
that
safety
which
belongs
to
a
crowd
or
else
those
upward
climbers
seeking
advancement
to
whom
every
new
invitation
into
best
was
an
object
of
as
much
elation
as
a
successful
battle
these
two
classes
of
persons
rejoiced
with
a
troubled
joy
but
the
rest
of
the
guests
were
either
indifferent
or
bored
or
discontented
they
had
come
because
everybody
was
coming
they
had
come
because
they
were
invited
and
it
was
part
of
the
routine
of
life
to
go
rage
was
boiling
in
their
souls
over
their
torn
lace
or
with
a
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
they
were
dreaming
of
their
favourite
chair
at
the
club
and
all
its
delights
they
said
the
same
things
over
and
over
to
the
same
people
whom
probably
in
the
morning
in
the
row
or
in
the
afternoon
at
places
they
had
met
and
said
the
same
things
to
before
edgar
stood
for
a
long
time
down
the
stair
and
helped
the
ladies
who
were
pushing
their
way
up
he
was
waiting
for
lady
augusta
and
her
party
who
were
very
late
he
was
waiting
without
any
excitement
but
with
a
little
alarm
wondering
if
he
could
say
anything
to
gussy
in
the
midst
of
such
a
crowd
or
if
still
a
would
be
given
to
him
he
did
not
want
to
elude
that
moment
but
only
it
was
so
difficult
to
do
it
so
hard
to
know
what
to
say
young
arden
is
very
nice
i
think
i
should
ever
have
got
upstairs
without
him
said
more
than
one
substantial
chaperon
is
waiting
for
the
thornleighs
the
daughters
would
say
everybody
had
decided
fate
for
him
some
people
said
it
had
been
all
settled
before
they
came
up
from
the
country
and
there
could
not
be
the
least
doubt
that
if
edgar
had
let
the
season
pass
without
saying
anything
to
gussy
he
would
have
been
concluded
by
everybody
to
have
used
her
very
and
a
great
many
speculations
passed
through
mind
as
he
stood
there
and
waited
sometimes
he
witnessed
such
a
meeting
as
ought
to
have
been
in
store
for
himself
he
saw
the
youth
and
maiden
meet
who
were
to
get
to
the
real
climax
in
their
romance
by
means
of
the
ball
and
wondered
within
himself
whether
the
outside
world
could
see
the
same
glow
in
his
eyes
which
he
could
see
in
those
of
the
other
lover
or
whether
the
same
delightful
atmosphere
of
consciousness
enveloped
gussy
as
that
which
seemed
to
enclose
the
other
girl
in
a
rosy
cloud
and
he
saw
other
pairs
meet
not
of
youths
and
maidens
he
saw
gleams
of
strange
fire
which
did
not
warm
but
burn
he
saw
the
vacant
looks
of
the
mass
the
factitious
flutter
of
delight
with
which
the
dull
crowd
recognised
its
acquaintances
lord
newmarch
came
up
to
him
when
he
had
occupied
this
perch
for
some
time
are
you
doing
here
of
all
places
in
the
world
are
you
going
or
coming
oh
i
see
you
are
waiting
for
the
thornleighs
he
said
are
generally
in
good
time
for
a
ball
am
waiting
because
it
is
amusing
here
said
edgar
careful
even
now
that
gussy
at
least
should
not
be
discussed
the
amusement
must
be
in
you
so
i
will
stay
by
you
said
lord
newmarch
some
of
it
may
come
my
way
what
an
odd
fellow
you
are
to
expect
to
be
amused
wherever
you
go
like
a
bumpkin
at
a
fair
by
the
way
that
reminds
me
arden
the
people
have
a
faculty
for
being
amused
which
is
wonderful
they
are
ready
for
it
at
all
times
and
seasons
you
know
not
like
us
it
is
a
faculty
which
ought
to
be
made
use
of
for
their
improvement
i
see
why
they
be
educated
in
spite
of
themselves
the
drama
for
instance
now
the
drama
has
lost
its
hold
on
to
us
the
play
is
a
bore
we
go
to
the
opera
to
see
each
other
not
to
hear
anything
but
the
people
are
all
agog
for
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
play
what
do
you
think
if
the
stage
has
any
vigour
left
in
it
instead
of
getting
up
sensation
dramas
for
cads
and
shopkeepers
cads
and
shopkeepers
are
part
of
the
people
said
edgar
that
is
not
what
i
mean
i
mean
the
real
lower
classes
the
working
men
our
masters
that
are
to
be
how
could
they
learn
patriotism
not
to
say
good
sense
better
than
by
means
of
shakespeare
poetry
of
the
highest
class
is
adapted
to
every
capacity
what
is
secondary
may
have
to
be
explained
and
broken
down
but
the
highest
think
i
must
ask
you
to
let
me
pass
said
edgar
seeing
the
shadow
of
lady
nose
which
was
prominent
on
the
wall
close
to
the
door
she
was
bringing
in
her
daughters
against
a
stream
which
was
flowing
out
and
the
struggle
was
very
difficult
and
demanded
the
greatest
care
i
suppose
i
am
not
wanted
any
longer
said
newmarch
arden
look
here
i
hope
you
mean
to
let
me
go
to
you
for
a
day
or
two
in
september
eh
not
for
the
partridges
wait
one
moment
i
should
be
glad
of
a
quiet
opportunity
to
speak
to
you
by
yourself
time
said
edgar
extricating
himself
as
best
he
could
from
the
crowd
one
moment
i
am
free
from
the
of
august
i
will
go
to
you
as
soon
as
you
like
you
know
why
i
ask
arden
remember
i
count
upon
your
good
offices
and
then
if
my
influence
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
precisely
said
edgar
swinging
himself
free
lord
newmarch
looked
after
him
with
a
little
metaphorical
lifting
up
of
hands
and
eyes
how
simple
the
boy
must
be
falling
a
hopeless
victim
to
gussy
thornleigh
his
next
door
neighbour
when
he
had
so
to
speak
all
england
to
choose
from
for
the
suit
of
arden
of
arden
was
not
one
which
was
likely
to
fail
unless
he
fixed
his
fancy
very
high
indeed
lord
newmarch
could
not
but
reflect
that
in
some
things
arden
had
very
greatly
the
advantage
even
of
himself
there
were
so
many
people
still
who
had
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
grandfathers
and
his
own
grandfather
though
the
first
earl
could
not
he
was
aware
bear
discussing
gussy
thornleigh
he
reflected
was
a
very
fortunate
woman
she
would
have
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
her
sister
helena
was
one
who
under
more
favourable
circumstances
would
have
attracted
lord
newmarch
himself
but
he
could
not
afford
to
throw
himself
away
upon
a
girl
who
had
nothing
and
whose
connections
even
were
not
of
a
kind
to
bring
advancement
nothing
could
be
better
than
her
family
no
doubt
but
then
she
had
a
quantity
of
brothers
who
would
have
to
be
pushed
on
in
the
world
and
no
doubt
the
husbands
would
be
called
upon
for
aid
and
influence
arden
was
the
very
sort
of
man
to
suffer
himself
to
be
so
called
on
he
would
be
ready
to
help
them
and
to
get
them
out
of
all
their
scrapes
it
was
he
who
would
be
looked
to
when
anything
was
the
matter
in
short
he
was
just
the
kind
of
man
to
marry
a
girl
who
was
one
of
a
large
family
lord
newmarch
reflected
that
he
himself
was
not
so
he
wanted
all
his
influence
all
his
money
everything
his
position
gave
him
for
himself
or
at
least
for
his
brothers
he
even
paused
to
ask
himself
whether
in
case
he
should
marry
clare
arden
he
might
not
be
appealed
to
as
a
connexion
of
the
family
for
appointments
for
some
of
those
thornleigh
boys
but
clare
he
reflected
was
not
a
fool
like
edgar
she
was
one
who
knew
what
was
due
to
a
position
and
that
there
were
few
who
had
anything
to
spare
accordingly
he
felt
easy
in
his
mind
respecting
that
very
far
off
danger
it
was
clare
who
was
the
proper
match
for
himself
and
with
a
little
shrug
of
his
shoulders
lord
newmarch
watched
edgar
make
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
where
lady
augusta
caught
in
an
eddy
with
all
her
train
of
girls
was
struggling
to
get
in
against
the
almost
irresistible
force
of
the
torrent
going
out
certainly
to
come
up
to
town
for
the
purpose
of
making
love
to
your
next
neighbour
in
the
country
was
a
waste
of
means
indeed
meanwhile
lady
augusta
had
seized
on
arm
with
a
sense
of
relief
which
made
her
heart
glow
with
grateful
warmth
it
was
another
evidence
of
what
a
good
son
he
would
be
what
a
help
in
need
am
so
thankful
to
see
you
she
cried
are
a
little
late
i
know
but
i
never
dreamt
that
people
would
be
going
so
soon
there
is
a
great
ball
in
eaton
square
i
believe
given
by
some
of
those
odious
that
is
where
everybody
is
flocking
this
was
said
loud
enough
to
catch
the
ear
of
the
crowd
which
was
going
out
and
which
had
whirled
lady
augusta
with
it
and
disordered
the
sweep
of
her
train
she
held
edgar
fast
while
she
made
her
way
upstairs
she
could
not
have
done
it
without
him
she
said
and
mourned
audibly
over
her
unfriended
condition
in
the
ear
of
her
future
promised
to
be
looking
out
for
us
she
said
i
suppose
he
is
dancing
or
something
else
that
amuses
him
and
thornleigh
is
never
any
use
to
us
socially
he
is
always
at
the
he
go
down
to
thorne
with
you
asked
edgar
meaning
nothing
in
particular
but
at
present
every
word
he
spoke
was
marked
and
noted
no
doubt
he
wanted
to
make
sure
of
being
able
to
communicate
with
father
at
once
he
stays
in
town
said
lady
augusta
a
few
weeks
longer
and
then
she
added
with
an
attempt
at
carelessness
am
the
family
arden
we
have
always
one
mind
about
the
children
and
their
concerns
he
says
it
saves
him
so
much
trouble
and
that
without
my
help
he
could
never
do
anything
it
is
pleasant
when
husband
thinks
so
who
of
course
knows
weaknesses
best
of
all
oh
what
a
business
it
is
getting
upstairs
gussy
keep
close
to
me
darling
ada
i
hope
you
are
not
feeling
faint
dear
dear
surely
there
must
be
bad
management
somewhere
i
think
i
never
saw
such
a
crush
in
a
private
lady
lowestoft
was
nearer
the
top
of
the
stair
than
usual
and
took
this
criticism
which
she
had
overheard
for
a
compliment
great
number
of
our
friends
have
been
so
good
as
to
come
to
us
she
said
lady
augusta
how
late
you
are
i
fear
the
dear
girls
will
scarcely
get
any
dancing
before
supper
did
you
meet
the
duke
as
you
came
in
he
is
looking
so
well
it
was
very
kind
of
him
to
come
so
early
i
really
must
scold
you
for
being
a
little
a
fool
that
woman
is
lady
augusta
whispered
in
ear
very
nearly
compromised
herself
last
season
with
your
cousin
arthur
arden
he
was
never
out
of
the
house
a
man
without
a
penny
and
whose
character
is
so
thoroughly
well
known
and
then
for
one
of
those
silly
women
who
are
really
silly
a
hundred
other
women
get
the
blame
of
it
which
is
very
hard
i
think
helena
is
always
talking
of
such
things
and
it
makes
one
thus
edgar
was
appropriated
for
a
long
time
until
he
had
found
a
seat
for
lady
augusta
and
had
placed
ada
who
did
not
dance
by
her
side
when
he
had
time
to
disengage
himself
he
saw
both
gussy
and
helena
whirling
about
among
the
dancers
for
they
were
popular
girls
and
always
had
partners
thus
the
whole
evening
went
past
and
he
found
no
opportunity
for
any
explanation
had
he
been
able
to
monopolise
attention
and
lead
her
away
to
a
corner
no
doubt
he
would
have
delivered
himself
of
what
he
had
to
say
but
then
it
was
not
so
very
urgent
had
it
been
very
urgent
of
course
he
could
have
found
the
ways
and
means
he
had
one
dance
with
her
but
nothing
could
be
said
then
and
though
he
proposed
a
walk
into
the
conservatory
fate
in
the
shape
of
another
partner
who
carried
her
off
triumphantly
interposed
and
what
could
a
man
do
more
he
had
been
perfectly
willing
to
make
the
full
plunge
and
in
the
meantime
he
watched
over
the
whole
family
as
if
he
had
been
their
brother
and
put
lady
augusta
into
her
carriage
afterwards
never
really
leaving
them
all
the
evening
if
this
was
not
to
himself
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
what
more
he
could
do
he
held
hand
after
he
put
her
in
and
said
something
about
calling
next
day
please
gussy
had
whispered
hurriedly
when
we
are
at
thorne
i
know
we
shall
all
be
at
sixes
and
sevens
and
no
time
to
she
too
understood
now
quite
calmly
and
frankly
that
this
next
visit
must
be
more
important
than
an
afternoon
call
and
he
pressed
her
hand
as
he
whispered
feeling
disposed
to
say
to
her
a
dear
kind
reasonable
girl
you
are
how
well
we
shall
understand
each
other
even
though
but
he
did
not
say
this
more
especially
the
though
and
he
stood
on
the
pavement
and
watched
them
drive
away
with
a
sensation
of
relief
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
by
this
time
and
did
not
intend
to
defer
the
crisis
a
moment
longer
than
was
necessary
but
still
on
the
whole
he
was
pleased
to
feel
that
whatever
might
happen
afterwards
he
was
going
back
to
arden
a
free
man
chapter
xxvi
into
my
before
you
go
to
bed
lady
augusta
whispered
in
her
ear
the
sisters
were
in
the
habit
of
holding
their
own
private
assemblies
at
that
confidential
moment
and
the
three
elder
ones
were
just
preparing
for
a
consultation
in
room
when
gussy
received
this
summons
of
course
she
obeyed
it
dutifully
with
her
pretty
hair
hanging
about
her
shoulders
in
a
pretty
white
all
gay
with
ribbons
and
embroidery
know
mamma
is
going
to
ask
me
ever
so
many
questions
and
i
have
nothing
to
tell
her
she
said
pouting
as
she
left
ada
and
helena
but
lady
augusta
was
very
gentle
in
her
questioning
think
your
hair
is
thicker
than
it
used
to
be
my
darling
she
said
taking
the
golden
locks
in
her
hand
with
fond
admiration
more
than
you
can
help
for
i
always
think
it
spoils
the
hair
yours
is
more
like
what
mine
used
to
be
than
any
of
the
others
gussy
is
like
your
but
my
hair
used
to
be
just
your
colour
alas
it
has
fallen
off
sadly
hair
is
a
great
deal
prettier
than
mine
said
gussy
putting
her
caressing
arm
round
her
neck
like
that
silver
shade
upon
it
hair
gets
so
sweet
when
it
gets
grey
one
loves
it
so
if
you
had
not
thought
so
much
about
us
all
mamma
dear
and
had
so
many
worries
you
would
not
have
had
a
white
thread
i
know
it
is
all
for
my
dear
said
lady
augusta
are
all
very
good
children
i
have
not
had
half
so
many
worries
as
most
people
it
is
in
the
family
the
hightons
all
grow
grey
early
you
were
looking
very
nice
that
blue
becomes
you
i
always
like
you
best
in
blue
did
you
dance
with
edgar
arden
more
than
once
gussy
i
could
not
quite
make
out
once
was
that
he
was
waiting
for
us
to
come
in
i
suppose
you
were
engaged
to
people
before
you
got
there
i
like
you
to
do
that
if
they
come
for
you
at
the
proper
moment
you
are
kept
from
dancing
altogether
and
look
as
if
you
were
neglected
and
if
they
do
come
probably
somebody
else
has
made
his
appearance
whom
you
would
like
better
i
approve
of
engaging
yourself
so
long
in
one
goes
to
dance
said
gussy
with
humility
to
tell
the
truth
mamma
arden
likes
looking
after
you
quite
as
much
as
dancing
with
me
he
likes
to
see
that
you
are
comfortable
and
have
some
one
pleasant
to
talk
to
and
want
for
anything
and
i
like
him
for
it
the
girl
cried
fervently
is
of
more
use
to
you
than
harry
is
i
like
him
because
he
is
so
fond
of
dear
said
lady
augusta
with
a
pleased
smile
is
good
to
me
on
your
account
and
you
must
not
say
anything
against
harry
harry
is
always
a
dear
boy
but
he
has
a
number
of
friends
and
he
knows
i
expect
him
to
give
up
his
own
pleasure
yes
edgar
arden
is
very
nice
i
deny
i
am
getting
quite
fond
of
him
did
he
had
you
any
particular
conversation
with
him
my
darling
mamma
said
gussy
with
her
eyes
cast
down
and
a
rising
colour
on
her
cheeks
perhaps
he
is
coming
did
he
say
anything
about
coming
said
lady
augusta
with
a
little
anxiety
in
her
tone
asked
me
if
he
might
but
i
said
no
i
thought
we
would
be
in
such
confusion
everything
packing
up
and
all
our
shopping
to
do
and
so
much
bother
and
then
probably
when
he
came
nobody
at
home
and
you
know
mamma
we
shall
meet
again
so
soon
next
week
said
gussy
apologetically
as
she
spoke
she
began
to
feel
that
perhaps
that
little
bit
of
maidenly
reluctance
had
been
a
mistake
and
lady
augusta
shook
her
head
dear
i
think
putting
off
is
ever
good
she
said
you
have
lived
as
long
as
i
have
you
will
know
upon
what
nothings
the
greatest
changes
may
turn
if
he
had
come
one
needed
no
ghost
to
tell
us
what
would
have
happened
but
next
week
is
a
different
thing
and
the
country
is
a
different
thing
from
town
there
are
seven
miles
between
arden
and
thorne
there
is
clare
at
the
other
end
to
hold
him
back
there
are
a
thousand
things
whereas
the
present
moment
you
know
there
is
nothing
like
the
present
moment
in
all
such
he
cared
so
little
for
me
cried
gussy
indignant
to
be
kept
back
by
seven
miles
or
even
by
clare
dear
that
is
not
the
question
said
her
mother
has
been
with
us
here
every
day
but
he
ride
over
to
thorne
every
day
he
will
find
business
waiting
for
him
and
his
visitors
will
begin
to
come
and
clare
without
meaning
any
harm
i
am
sure
clare
would
never
put
herself
in
opposition
to
you
she
is
a
great
deal
too
proud
for
that
but
without
meaning
it
she
will
make
engagements
for
him
she
will
expect
him
to
attend
to
her
a
little
and
it
is
quite
natural
she
should
i
am
very
sorry
you
did
not
let
him
come
for
my
own
part
i
should
have
liked
to
see
him
again
i
am
growing
quite
fond
of
him
gussy
he
is
the
sort
of
young
man
whom
one
can
put
such
confidence
in
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
his
advice
about
phil
at
harrow
i
should
have
liked
but
of
course
it
can
not
be
helped
now
i
think
i
will
ask
them
both
to
come
and
spend
a
week
with
us
at
cried
gussy
with
a
violent
blush
please
fancy
inviting
a
man
any
man
for
the
express
purpose
oh
please
for
my
sake
do
such
a
thing
as
that
a
thing
as
what
asked
lady
augusta
gravely
you
happen
to
have
a
little
feeling
on
the
subject
that
is
not
to
prevent
me
i
hope
from
doing
my
duty
to
my
nearest
neighbours
clare
arden
has
not
paid
us
a
visit
since
she
went
into
mourning
and
she
really
ought
not
to
be
encouraged
to
go
on
wearing
black
and
shutting
herself
up
in
this
absurd
way
i
will
write
and
invite
them
you
see
autumn
is
approaching
and
of
course
he
has
asked
quantities
of
people
young
men
always
do
the
first
season
when
they
feel
they
have
a
house
all
to
themselves
no
my
dear
say
anything
i
know
more
of
the
world
than
you
do
and
i
know
there
is
nothing
so
perilous
as
letting
such
a
thing
drag
on
he
had
better
either
ask
you
at
once
or
make
it
quite
plain
that
he
is
not
going
to
ask
you
and
much
as
i
like
him
gussy
if
this
is
not
decided
directly
i
shall
certainly
not
invite
him
any
you
make
me
so
ashamed
of
myself
said
gussy
you
ask
him
to
thorne
for
such
a
purpose
i
know
i
shall
not
be
able
to
look
at
him
i
will
not
be
civil
to
him
i
could
not
so
it
will
do
more
harm
than
am
not
afraid
that
you
will
be
uncivil
said
lady
augusta
with
a
smile
it
was
very
foolish
of
you
to
say
he
was
not
to
come
i
think
how
you
could
do
it
sometimes
it
is
true
it
is
better
for
a
man
not
to
think
he
is
too
distinctly
understood
sometimes
but
never
mind
my
dear
i
see
it
is
i
who
must
manage
matters
now
go
and
put
up
your
hair
and
go
to
bed
oh
mamma
dear
cried
gussy
with
her
arms
round
her
neck
how
could
i
ever
speak
to
him
when
i
knew
how
could
i
ever
look
him
in
the
face
hope
you
know
how
to
conduct
yourself
towards
all
your
guests
said
lady
augusta
with
dignity
you
i
should
feel
that
i
must
have
brought
you
up
very
badly
i
hear
your
step
coming
along
the
corridor
good
night
my
darling
go
to
bed
and
think
any
more
of
it
and
be
sure
you
let
angelique
your
thus
dismissed
gussy
sped
along
the
passage
and
rushed
in
breathless
and
indignant
yet
not
so
indignant
as
she
looked
into
room
where
her
sisters
were
waiting
for
her
fancy
she
cried
throwing
herself
into
the
nearest
chair
think
what
mamma
is
going
to
do
because
i
would
not
let
him
come
here
when
we
will
all
be
in
such
confusion
she
is
going
to
write
and
ask
the
ardens
to
thorne
i
shall
never
be
able
to
look
him
in
the
face
i
shall
feel
he
knows
exactly
what
is
meant
oh
to
think
a
man
should
be
able
to
suppose
one
expects
he
will
think
it
is
my
doing
he
will
imagine
i
want
him
oh
ada
what
shall
i
do
dear
hush
said
ada
who
was
the
consoler
of
the
house
while
helena
in
her
of
indignant
womanhood
took
up
strain
will
think
women
are
all
exactly
the
same
that
is
what
he
will
think
ready
to
compass
sea
and
land
for
the
sake
of
a
settlement
cried
helena
if
you
loved
him
it
would
not
be
so
bad
or
if
he
thought
you
loved
him
but
it
is
for
the
settlement
it
is
because
your
trade
is
to
get
married
you
see
now
the
justice
of
all
i
have
been
saying
if
you
could
learn
a
profession
like
a
man
men
would
never
dare
to
think
so
but
the
worst
is
it
is
true
all
that
mamma
thinks
of
is
to
get
you
settled
at
arden
all
she
thinks
of
is
to
get
you
provided
for
all
she
cares
cried
gussy
with
a
burst
of
tears
hear
you
say
a
single
word
against
hush
both
of
you
children
said
gentle
ada
you
must
not
storm
and
gussy
dear
i
bear
you
to
cry
what
mamma
does
always
comes
out
right
it
may
not
be
just
what
one
could
desire
nor
what
one
would
do
self
but
it
always
turns
out
better
than
one
expects
of
course
she
wants
to
see
you
provided
for
it
her
duty
she
wants
you
to
be
happy
and
well
off
and
have
the
good
of
your
life
as
she
has
nobody
can
say
mamma
has
not
done
her
duty
sometimes
it
seems
a
little
hard
to
others
but
we
all
know
you
dear
ada
cried
both
her
sisters
taking
the
comforter
between
them
and
weeping
over
her
but
she
who
was
the
martyr
of
the
family
did
not
weep
she
gave
them
a
kiss
first
one
and
then
the
other
and
smiled
at
their
girlish
ready
tears
have
never
said
very
much
about
it
she
said
i
think
i
know
edgar
arden
he
will
not
think
anything
disagreeable
about
invitation
if
she
sends
it
he
is
not
that
kind
of
man
he
is
not
always
finding
people
out
like
some
of
friends
he
would
not
do
anything
that
is
nasty
himself
and
he
would
never
suspect
anybody
else
it
would
not
come
into
his
head
and
then
he
is
fond
of
mamma
and
all
of
us
i
am
quite
sure
as
sure
as
if
i
had
put
it
to
the
proof
that
he
would
do
anything
for
if
i
were
to
ask
him
not
to
speak
of
gussy
and
if
that
is
really
what
he
means
think
you
think
it
is
said
gussy
with
a
little
flush
of
pride
am
sure
you
think
it
is
be
afraid
to
speak
quite
plainly
you
suppose
i
care
i
do
suppose
you
care
said
ada
giving
her
sister
another
sympathetic
kiss
all
care
i
am
fond
of
him
too
i
should
like
to
be
quite
sure
he
was
to
be
my
brother
gussy
and
i
should
like
for
his
sake
to
make
sure
that
you
too
it
does
not
matter
what
a
girl
feels
said
gussy
pettishly
waving
her
pretty
hair
about
her
face
and
concealing
her
looks
behind
it
have
to
marry
somebody
and
then
there
are
so
many
of
us
mamma
says
i
am
not
to
my
hair
but
if
i
how
can
i
ever
make
a
show
as
everybody
does
she
would
not
like
to
see
me
different
from
other
girls
oh
me
i
wish
i
was
not
a
girl
obliged
to
take
such
trouble
about
how
i
look
and
what
people
will
think
and
obliged
to
wonder
and
bother
and
worry
everybody
about
what
some
man
is
going
to
say
next
time
i
meet
him
oh
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
hate
men
hate
them
said
helena
should
we
treat
them
simply
as
your
they
have
got
to
live
in
the
world
and
so
have
we
the
only
thing
is
that
we
need
not
try
to
make
each
other
miserable
there
is
room
enough
for
both
of
us
if
they
will
only
let
me
use
my
faculties
i
will
take
care
not
to
interfere
with
them
i
am
not
afraid
for
my
part
to
meet
them
upon
equal
terms
i
am
so
tired
said
gussy
want
to
meet
any
one
on
equal
terms
i
never
want
to
see
one
of
the
wretched
creatures
again
i
wish
somebody
would
shut
them
all
up
and
let
us
have
a
little
peace
i
wish
somebody
would
come
and
do
my
hair
nell
you
have
got
nothing
to
vex
you
if
you
do
not
mind
a
little
trouble
please
ring
for
angelique
and
then
gussy
sat
still
with
tolerable
composure
and
had
her
hair
plaited
up
tight
and
chattered
about
the
dance
her
mind
after
all
was
not
seriously
disturbed
either
by
silence
or
her
threatened
invitation
perhaps
indeed
on
the
whole
it
would
be
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
to
have
him
at
thorne
he
was
so
nice
in
a
house
he
was
kind
to
everybody
always
ready
to
make
himself
useful
a
great
deal
more
serviceable
than
harry
and
to
be
sure
he
had
understood
perfectly
and
so
had
she
what
would
have
been
said
if
amidst
all
the
bother
of
packing
they
had
met
it
had
not
been
spoken
in
words
but
in
everything
else
it
was
decided
and
settled
gussy
fell
into
silence
after
a
while
and
let
the
idea
of
him
glide
pleasantly
tenderly
through
her
mind
he
was
not
a
man
who
would
be
like
papa
absorbed
in
his
estate
and
his
sessions
and
his
game
he
would
not
be
selfish
as
harry
sometimes
was
he
could
not
help
being
thoughtful
of
other
people
tender
of
everybody
belonging
to
him
there
had
been
moments
when
gussy
had
entertained
a
certain
harmless
envy
of
supremacy

she
envied
her
no
longer

queen

clare
chapter
xxvii
while
all
these
discussions
were
going
on
in
berkeley
square
edgar
was
preparing
in
the
most
leisurely
and
way
for
his
return
home
he
had
forgotten
the
urgency
of
letter
but
he
was
glad
to
emancipate
himself
from
the
social
treadmill
which
he
did
not
understand
and
set
his
face
again
towards
the
fair
green
country
and
his
duties
and
his
home
it
seemed
so
rational
a
life
in
comparison
that
he
had
even
a
higher
opinion
of
himself
when
he
turned
his
back
upon
town
and
its
amusements
not
for
anything
bad
he
had
encountered
there
the
wickedness
had
not
thrust
itself
upon
him
his
own
temper
and
thoughts
leaving
him
out
of
harmony
with
it
but
the
foolishness
had
struck
him
with
double
force
wickedness
itself
is
better
than
no
meaning
at
least
it
is
less
contemptible
less
bewildering
more
comprehensible
he
was
not
only
going
home
but
he
was
about
to
change
the
fashion
of
his
life
to
begin
who
could
tell
what
alterations
in
everything
about
him
and
a
little
gentle
excitement
was
in
his
mind
not
any
impassioned
sentiment
not
any
whirlwind
of
fear
and
hope
he
could
not
even
say
to
himself
that
the
happiness
of
his
life
depended
on
reply
or
on
the
chance
whether
or
not
she
would
share
the
rest
of
his
life
with
him
but
still
the
thought
of
so
sweet
a
companion
moved
him
with
a
little
thrill
of
pleasurable
emotion
there
was
still
the
chance
that
he
should
meet
them
the
next
day
a
chance
which
lady
augusta
did
not
take
into
consideration
and
as
the
shopping
occupied
the
girls
and
withdrew
them
from
the
usual
regions
of
society
the
fact
was
that
he
did
not
meet
them
anywhere
and
found
the
day
hang
very
heavy
on
his
hands
in
consequence
when
he
fell
suddenly
upon
ada
late
in
the
afternoon
returning
accompanied
by
her
maid
from
a
visit
to
some
with
whom
she
was
allied
edgar
brightened
up
instantly
he
came
to
her
side
and
insisted
on
walking
with
her
across
the
park
she
had
very
little
to
say
except
at
moments
when
her
sympathy
was
in
forcible
requisition
and
was
not
in
the
least
an
amusing
companion
but
he
did
his
best
to
talk
to
her
and
showed
her
clearly
how
glad
he
was
to
see
her
was
told
i
was
not
wanted
at
berkeley
square
he
said
has
been
very
doleful
for
me
i
shall
ride
over
to
thorne
on
tuesday
and
bid
you
welcome
am
sure
mamma
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
said
gentle
ada
and
she
too
went
home
a
little
excited
by
the
encounter
said
he
would
ride
over
on
tuesday
to
bid
us
welcome
she
repeated
to
lady
augusta
the
moment
she
entered
perhaps
mamma
you
will
not
require
to
send
that
invitation
which
troubles
gussy
so
much
it
is
best
when
these
things
come
of
it
is
my
dear
said
lady
augusta
knew
he
was
the
nicest
fellow
he
shall
stay
to
dinner
if
he
and
so
that
matter
was
settled
gussy
even
made
up
her
mind
what
dress
she
would
put
on
to
meet
him
on
that
eventful
afternoon
which
probably
would
decide
her
fate
her
mother
liked
her
best
in
blue
and
so
she
decided
did
he
for
had
he
not
once
said
so
gussy
made
a
mental
memorandum
and
felt
a
warm
little
thrill
of
tender
kindness
at
her
heart
for
the
man
who
loved
her
of
course
he
loved
her
she
might
have
other
inducements
to
marry
him
the
charm
of
arden
the
necessity
of
being
provided
for
the
trade
as
helena
called
it
of
getting
married
would
all
weigh
consciously
or
unconsciously
with
her
but
with
him
there
could
be
but
one
reason
love
and
heart
swelled
with
that
tender
gratitude
and
kindness
and
half
pity
with
which
a
woman
whose
affections
are
quite
free
and
disengaged
often
regards
the
man
who
has
as
people
say
fallen
in
love
with
her
pity
she
could
not
tell
why
a
soft
half
regret
that
she
could
not
give
him
so
much
as
he
gave
her
dear
boy
she
said
to
herself
and
then
shyly
peeping
as
it
were
behind
a
veil
found
out
that
she
might
love
him
too
could
be
very
fond
of
him
after
when
and
she
caressed
her
blue
dress
with
a
smile
and
a
little
emotion
and
looked
that
the
ribbons
were
fresh
that
must
be
worn
with
it
before
angelique
packed
it
away
likes
me
in
blue
she
said
with
a
conscious
smile
alas
but
nobody
knew
nor
suspected
how
little
the
blue
dress
would
be
thought
of
or
how
different
the
reality
and
the
imagination
would
be
edgar
went
down
next
morning
to
his
nearest
railway
station
with
an
absolute
absence
of
every
exciting
incident
the
groom
was
waiting
with
his
dogcart
the
western
sun
threw
a
slanting
line
on
the
country
everything
looked
like
and
peace
all
right
at
the
hall
he
asked
for
mere
sake
as
he
took
the
reins
sir
so
far
as
i
know
sir
but
fillpot
she
thinks
something
to
do
with
miss
arden
said
the
groom
to
do
edgar
echoed
unfamiliar
with
the
homely
phrase
sir
she
thinks
does
fillpot
said
the
man
a
headache
i
suppose
edgar
thought
to
himself
and
drove
on
without
alarm
how
fresh
the
country
was
how
green
the
trees
how
restful
all
those
houses
the
villagers
at
their
doors
the
village
patriarchs
working
leisurely
in
their
little
gardens
even
the
red
house
as
he
passed
it
blinked
and
shone
in
the
sunshine
offering
him
a
certain
welcome
was
arthur
arden
there
still
he
wondered
and
how
was
his
suit
progressing
and
what
did
alice
pimpernel
think
of
it
had
she
said
yes
arden
to
his
wooing
all
these
things
passed
through
mind
as
he
drove
along
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
and
the
pleasant
confidence
of
a
man
going
home
he
was
glad
to
recognise
the
very
trees
much
more
the
familiar
faces
glad
to
think
of
his
welcome
which
awaited
him
full
of
natural
satisfaction
and
content
the
first
shadow
that
crossed
him
was
at
the
corner
of
the
road
which
led
to
the
red
house
there
he
paused
for
a
moment
hearing
behind
him
a
sudden
rush
and
din
upon
the
road
the
sound
as
of
horses
that
had
run
away
then
they
appeared
in
sight
tearing
onward
coming
full
speed
towards
him
making
his
own
horse
plunge
and
struggle
between
the
shafts
edgar
flung
the
reins
to
his
groom
and
jumped
down
instantly
to
see
if
he
could
be
of
use
but
had
not
touched
the
ground
when
they
rushed
past
him
bays
a
excitable
pair
the
reins
were
flying
loosely
about
their
necks
the
horses
were
with
fright
and
agitation
and
a
succession
of
screams
proved
if
the
gleam
of
feminine
dress
had
not
been
enough
to
do
so
that
the
light
waggon
had
not
its
ordinary
passengers
but
was
driven
by
a
lady
it
swept
round
the
corner
like
a
whirlwind
and
edgar
with
hopeless
horror
rushed
after
as
he
did
so
he
perceived
two
figures
running
wildly
across
a
field
in
advance
to
cut
off
their
progress
it
was
pimpernel
and
arthur
arden
edgar
stopped
seeing
how
hopeless
was
an
idea
of
being
of
use
and
watched
with
breathless
interest
the
course
of
the
two
men
who
might
yet
be
in
time
then
there
was
a
plunge
a
shriek
the
appearance
as
of
something
falling
like
the
flight
of
a
bird
or
an
arrow
from
the
high
seat
to
the
ground
edgar
shut
his
eyes
involuntarily
with
a
movement
of
sympathetic
pain
when
he
opened
them
again
the
horses
were
standing
trembling
and
panting
with
the
groom
at
their
heads
who
had
appeared
he
could
not
tell
how
or
whence
and
pimpernel
and
arthur
arden
were
standing
each
by
a
little
particoloured
heap
on
the
roadside
a
sudden
wild
fancy
that
clare
might
have
been
one
of
the
sufferers
came
into
mind
and
he
called
to
his
man
to
follow
him
and
hastened
up
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
when
he
reached
it
he
found
pimpernel
pale
as
death
and
trembling
lifting
up
his
daughter
who
had
been
thrown
upon
a
mossy
bank
at
the
foot
of
the
hedge
alice
was
ghastly
with
little
streams
of
blood
trickling
down
her
forehead
but
she
was
conscious
and
not
apparently
severely
injured
is
nothing
papa
i
am
only
scratched
and
shaken
that
is
all
she
was
saying
while
her
father
too
much
agitated
to
understand
dragged
her
up
in
his
arms
and
overwhelmed
her
with
incoherent
questions
edgar
ran
and
brought
her
water
from
a
pool
close
by
which
was
not
of
the
clearest
and
yet
sufficed
to
wash
the
trickling
drops
off
her
forehead
and
lessen
her
apprehensions
and
then
he
produced
his
travelling
flask
of
sherry
which
revived
her
still
more
completely
it
did
not
occur
to
him
even
that
there
was
another
sufferer
nor
that
his
cousin
whom
he
had
seen
a
moment
before
was
lending
no
assistance
here
i
can
stand
i
am
not
hurt
papa
i
am
only
shaken
alice
was
repeating
till
edgar
almost
loved
her
for
her
pertinacity
the
father
was
totally
helpless
and
overcome
girl
my
child
he
was
repeating
with
white
lips
drawing
her
into
his
arms
do
not
think
she
is
hurt
sir
said
edgar
whose
impressionable
heart
was
touched
us
put
her
into
my
dogcart
and
my
groom
will
drive
her
gently
yes
that
is
best
said
alice
you
hurt
me
but
oh
i
am
not
injured
i
am
only
aching
and
shaken
and
oh
papa
is
it
cried
edgar
seeing
her
anxious
glance
round
the
name
sounded
like
a
cry
and
then
all
at
once
the
whole
party
were
aware
of
arthur
arden
making
his
way
towards
the
nearest
cottage
with
something
in
his
arms
even
pimpernel
grew
silent
in
his
anxiety
alice
shivered
violently
and
fell
back
upon
edgar
who
put
out
his
arm
to
support
her
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
pain
and
terror
in
his
heart
no
moan
nor
cry
came
from
the
thing
in
arthur
arms
was
it
jeanie
who
lay
thus
in
a
heap
silent
undistinguishable
alice
shuddered
more
and
more
and
fell
down
on
her
knees
and
began
to
cry
while
old
pimpernel
in
his
excitement
rose
and
said
anything
has
happened
to
her
i
will
shoot
those
d
d
horses
and
that
d
d
fool
but
for
him
curse
him
it
would
never
have
edgar
felt
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
turned
to
stone
what
was
jeanie
to
him
that
her
peril
should
so
move
him
it
was
the
horror
of
it
done
as
it
were
before
his
eyes
and
then
her
grandmother
while
alice
wept
and
her
father
stormed
edgar
felt
his
very
heart
grow
sick
her
home
he
said
peremptorily
to
pimpernel
who
stilled
in
his
excitement
by
any
sudden
voice
of
authority
humbly
obeyed
between
them
they
lifted
alice
still
weeping
and
moaning
into
the
dogcart
and
slowly
and
steadily
she
was
driven
home
to
the
red
house
edgar
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
she
was
gone
and
then
he
turned
with
the
silent
speed
of
excitement
after
arthur
arden
to
the
cottage
door
there
there
was
nothing
but
excitement
and
commotion
one
neighbour
had
gone
already
for
somers
another
was
carrying
water
to
bring
the
sufferer
to
herself
one
woman
shook
her
head
and
said
saw
her
face
and
the
face
of
death
never
come
your
tongue
said
another
as
like
life
as
you
or
me
come
round
fast
enough
if
hold
your
noise
and
look
after
the
the
din
will
hurt
her
said
a
third
was
jeanie
killed
all
in
a
moment
the
harmless
gentle
little
creature
had
she
been
dashed
into
the
unknown
world
as
this
thought
went
through
mind
he
heard
a
little
stir
among
the
gossips
a
silence
and
rustle
of
all
their
dresses
as
they
stood
back
instinctively
is
her
grandmother
they
said
and
immediately
after
murray
very
pale
and
steadfast
suddenly
passed
through
the
crowd
how
heart
yearned
over
the
old
woman
whom
he
knew
so
little
of
who
was
nothing
to
him
admiration
pity
something
more
deep
than
either
swept
over
him
this
poor
woman
who
had
done
so
much
who
had
taken
upon
her
so
many
burdens
was
this
the
reward
god
was
about
to
give
for
all
her
toils
and
trials
her
child
snatched
from
her
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
other
was
safe
who
herself
and
all
belonging
to
her
had
thought
of
nothing
but
their
own
pleasure
and
profit
all
their
lives
and
it
was
this
woman
who
had
suffered
and
toiled
and
spent
her
life
for
others
who
was
to
open
her
breast
again
and
receive
the
cruellest
blow
strange
compensation
reward
and
encouragement
edgar
attempted
to
enter
two
or
three
times
but
was
kept
back
by
the
crowd
bless
you
sir
you
do
no
good
they
said
to
him
one
gentleman
there
already
and
better
be
without
somehow
it
was
a
kind
of
comfort
to
think
that
arthur
arden
was
in
the
way
and
of
no
use
it
made
even
edgar
more
patient
as
he
stood
without
waiting
for
his
dogcart
and
brooding
over
those
strange
imperfections
of
life
one
taken
and
the
other
left
but
why
jeanie
why
the
old
one
comfort
and
consolation
when
the
dogcart
arrived
he
sent
it
off
in
search
of
the
doctor
he
forgot
all
about
clare
and
her
anxiety
and
thought
of
nothing
but
the
dead
or
dying
girl
after
a
while
arthur
arden
came
out
very
pale
with
a
tremor
and
suppressed
agitation
that
was
pitiful
to
see
his
mind
was
not
even
sufficiently
disengaged
to
be
surprised
at
this
sudden
appearance
of
his
cousin
he
put
out
his
hand
to
edgar
unconsciously
with
a
certain
appeal
to
his
sympathy
was
my
fault
he
said
hoarsely
and
thus
the
two
stood
almost
clinging
together
till
the
dogcart
rattled
past
over
the
bit
of
causeway
bringing
the
doctor
arthur
put
his
arm
within
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
she
dies
he
repeated
hoarsely
with
large
drops
standing
on
his
forehead
will
be
my
chapter
xxviii
how
did
it
happen
a
question
so
easy
to
ask
recalling
so
often
in
the
midst
of
the
most
tragic
seriousness
a
moment
of
utter
levity
gaiety
and
carelessness
a
light
impulse
for
which
never
all
his
life
long
will
some
one
forgive
himself
was
my
fault
arthur
arden
explained
with
a
voice
choked
and
broken
had
driven
miss
pimpernel
to
the
station
to
meet
her
father
and
we
met
and
stopped
to
talk
to
jeanie
on
the
way
we
talked
to
her
and
offered
her
carelessly
a
drive
when
we
came
back
on
the
way
back
we
found
her
still
on
the
same
spot
i
got
down
to
speak
to
her
and
so
did
old
pimpernel
heaven
knows
why
then
there
was
some
talk
about
this
drive
she
did
not
understand
us
she
had
no
intention
of
coming
it
was
i
who
almost
lifted
her
into
the
carriage
i
had
my
foot
on
the
step
to
mount
after
her
when
alice
seized
the
reins
and
dashed
on
ask
me
any
more
and
now
god
help
us
that
innocent
creature
is
dying
and
it
is
my
fault
is
more
miss
fault
said
edgar
but
he
turned
from
his
kinsman
with
a
dislike
and
sense
of
repulsion
which
he
could
hardly
explain
arthur
on
the
contrary
clung
to
him
with
painful
anxiety
leave
me
until
we
hear
he
cried
he
kept
his
arm
within
holding
him
fast
feeling
him
to
be
a
defence
against
the
pimpernels
against
murray
against
even
the
sour
looks
of
somers
when
he
should
come
no
doubt
arthur
felt
the
whole
world
would
blame
him
and
consider
jeanie
as
his
victim
the
pimpernels
would
forsake
him
and
clare
he
said
with
sudden
weakness
have
had
a
great
deal
to
annoy
me
since
you
went
away
these
people
the
pimpernels
invited
me
after
a
while
and
i
stayed
thinking
i
hesitate
to
say
for
you
know
thinking
i
should
be
near
your
sister
and
clare
has
behaved
to
me
for
sake
said
edgar
angrily
will
have
nothing
said
of
clare
let
us
see
what
comes
of
this
business
in
the
first
place
it
is
enough
for
the
blame
me
said
arthur
course
i
knew
you
would
blame
me
but
as
you
have
said
yourself
it
was
that
fool
of
a
girl
who
was
to
blame
good
god
how
could
she
drive
these
fiery
brutes
i
told
her
it
was
impossible
if
it
had
only
been
herself
she
had
killed
and
not
poor
jeanie
little
sake
be
silent
cried
edgar
furiously
trying
to
shake
off
the
hand
on
his
arm
excitement
and
apprehension
had
produced
upon
arthur
the
effect
of
wine
his
nerves
were
so
shaken
that
he
almost
wept
as
he
repeated
name
remorse
and
anxiety
and
pity
which
were
as
much
for
himself
as
for
any
of
the
others
unmanned
him
altogether
he
was
deeply
distressed
for
the
girl
whom
his
folly
had
helped
to
place
in
such
jeopardy
but
he
was
also
distressed
for
himself
wondering
and
asking
himself
what
he
should
do
how
he
should
ever
free
himself
from
the
consequences
of
such
a
misfortune
clare
was
lost
unless
her
brother
interposed
and
though
he
was
innocent
surely
in
respect
to
alice
pimpernel
she
was
lost
too
with
her
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
jeanie
poor
little
innocent
victim
was
probably
dying
no
gratification
to
himself
or
his
vanity
could
be
got
out
of
further
pursuit
of
her
this
selfish
compunction
was
but
the
undercurrent
it
is
true
above
that
was
a
stream
of
genuine
grief
and
distress
for
the
suffering
creature
but
he
had
thought
of
himself
too
long
to
be
able
altogether
to
dismiss
the
consideration
now
half
the
village
had
gathered
about
the
door
when
the
dogcart
which
played
so
large
a
part
in
the
scene
dashed
up
again
bringing
somers
of
all
houses
in
the
world
it
was
the
cottage
of
sally
timms
the
one
nearest
the
end
of
the
village
into
which
jeanie
had
been
carried
sally
was
as
prompt
and
ready
of
resource
as
she
was
thriftless
and
untidy
but
the
surrounding
villagers
did
not
respect
her
house
sufficiently
to
keep
out
of
it
or
to
keep
silent
the
doctor
dispersed
them
with
a
few
sharp
words
those
children
away
instantly
and
keep
the
place
quiet
or
bring
perfitt
down
upon
you
he
said
emphatically
name
did
what
master
had
not
thought
of
doing
and
edgar
immediately
bestirred
himself
to
second
the
doctor
he
partly
coaxed
partly
frightened
the
crowd
away
while
arthur
stood
gloomily
leaning
against
the
little
garden
gate
chewing
the
cud
of
very
bitter
reflections
then
there
was
a
long
pause
a
pause
of
intense
expectation
the
women
who
had
been
sent
away
watched
from
the
corner
and
from
their
own
doors
for
the
reappearance
of
the
doctor
the
children
slunk
away
into
distant
groups
now
and
then
seduced
into
a
shout
or
gambol
which
was
instantly
put
a
stop
to
by
some
indignant
spectator
the
very
birds
and
insects
seemed
to
pause
the
leaves
rustled
less
loudly
a
stranger
seeing
so
many
silent
spectators
all
with
their
eyes
turned
towards
the
cottage
door
all
in
such
a
stillness
of
suspense
would
have
found
the
scene
very
difficult
to
interpret
the
dogcart
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
road
with
the
groom
in
it
gathering
up
the
reins
close
in
his
hands
and
ready
to
rush
anywhere
for
whatever
might
be
wanted
edgar
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
dusty
road
with
a
sense
that
if
he
approached
a
step
nearer
the
very
sound
of
his
step
might
disturb
the
patient
and
sally
youngest
child
and
silent
sat
in
the
dust
and
gazed
up
with
eyes
at
arthur
arden
leaning
upon
the
garden
gate
at
length
somers
came
out
and
everybody
made
one
sudden
step
forward
he
held
out
his
hands
warning
them
off
noise
he
said
excitement
silence
quiet
is
everything
come
with
me
and
i
will
tell
you
what
to
she
will
live
if
all
this
care
has
to
be
taken
was
the
thought
that
past
like
lightning
through
arthur
mind
and
he
recovered
his
courage
a
little
the
two
cousins
followed
the
doctor
towards
the
little
conclave
of
women
at
the
corner
look
here
he
said
making
an
address
to
the
community
in
general
poor
child
is
lying
between
life
and
death
she
may
go
any
moment
but
if
you
will
keep
everything
quiet
and
those
confounded
children
of
yours
and
keep
away
from
the
house
and
stop
all
noises
we
may
bring
her
through
bless
you
sir
cried
old
sarah
who
was
present
with
her
girls
crying
and
curtseying
the
other
women
were
silent
and
perhaps
not
so
much
impressed
they
were
ready
to
give
any
amount
of
wondering
attentive
sympathy
but
to
keep
their
children
quiet
was
another
matter
one
rushed
away
out
of
the
circle
with
a
baby
which
was
beginning
to
cry
another
administered
a
private
box
on
the
ear
to
an
urchin
who
had
no
thoughts
of
making
any
noise
but
yet
they
murmured
a
little
in
their
hearts
doctor
means
said
edgar
the
poor
girl
is
a
stranger
and
that
all
you
arden
folks
are
too
friendly
and
kind
to
mind
a
little
trouble
you
shall
send
the
children
to
play
in
the
park
and
the
men
will
help
me
to
have
straw
put
over
the
causeway
at
once
where
is
john
hesketh
i
know
you
will
all
do
your
very
that
we
will
squire
cried
the
women
there
was
nothing
in
this
speech
about
but
the
results
to
the
children
were
more
terrible
than
anything
proposed
by
the
doctor
the
mothers
made
a
general
rush
at
them
and
put
them
to
bed
you
the
only
place
quiet
cried
one
and
another
and
edgar
hurrying
to
the
house
of
the
most
respected
inhabitant
of
arden
got
a
little
party
organised
at
once
to
lay
down
straw
upon
the
road
he
went
with
them
himself
eager
and
busy
while
arthur
stood
at
the
corner
with
the
doctor
like
him
somers
said
very
unlike
the
ardens
was
it
he
that
helped
on
this
catastrophe
that
he
is
so
anxious
and
busy
now
said
arthur
without
seeing
the
full
meaning
of
the
question
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
was
i
who
was
to
i
thought
so
cried
somers
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
a
suppressed
chuckle
his
professional
gravity
was
over
for
the
moment
having
lasted
as
long
as
was
necessary
and
now
he
was
at
leisure
to
indulge
in
his
ordinary
speculations
did
you
think
so
asked
arthur
coldly
you
are
a
true
arden
and
you
are
taking
no
trouble
about
it
was
the
reply
and
somers
went
on
after
he
had
discharged
this
shaft
with
an
inward
satisfaction
not
unnatural
in
the
circumstances
it
was
not
that
he
was
indifferent
to
poor
fate
but
he
was
used
to
danger
and
was
not
by
it
as
are
the
inexperienced
even
while
he
walked
up
the
into
the
village
street
he
was
turning
over
with
professional
seriousness
and
anxiety
what
measures
it
would
be
best
to
take
pondering
closely
which
was
most
suitable
but
he
could
not
refuse
himself
the
pleasure
of
shooting
that
javelin
it
did
not
do
arthur
arden
any
great
harm
and
it
relieved
him
about
jeanie
more
than
a
more
favourable
judgment
of
her
case
would
have
done
in
his
ignorance
he
concluded
that
a
doctor
could
not
jibe
at
other
men
if
his
patient
was
in
very
great
danger
and
as
for
the
straw
and
so
forth
that
was
in
way
not
his
edgar
was
the
master
and
free
to
order
what
he
pleased
and
besides
was
a
commonplace
being
who
naturally
thought
of
such
matters
of
detail
so
long
as
jeanie
was
not
going
to
die
that
was
all
that
absolutely
affected
him
and
heaven
knows
being
relieved
of
that
first
dread
he
had
enough
on
his
hands
and
his
mind
there
were
the
pimpernels
whom
he
would
have
to
face
with
the
consciousness
that
he
had
been
instrumental
in
risking
their
life
or
at
least
in
putting
her
in
circumstances
to
risk
it
and
what
was
still
worse
that
he
had
thought
nothing
of
alice
done
nothing
for
her
had
not
even
inquired
if
she
was
badly
hurt
or
in
danger
this
last
reflection
disconcerted
him
wholly
he
could
not
hasten
to
the
red
house
as
he
had
intended
to
show
a
tardy
but
still
eager
sympathy
while
still
he
was
unaware
what
had
happened
to
alice
he
had
to
hasten
after
his
cousin
who
knew
all
about
her
pursuing
him
to
the
and
the
stacks
where
he
was
loading
his
volunteer
labourers
and
losing
the
precious
time
which
he
ought
to
have
spent
in
smoothing
down
the
pimpernels
a
little
i
have
no
time
to
speak
to
you
edgar
said
to
him
am
busy
watch
the
road
that
no
carts
pass
till
we
are
ready
what
were
all
these
ridiculous
details
to
him
the
girl
was
not
going
to
die
and
how
was
he
to
face
the
pimpernels
pimpernel
she
is
not
much
hurt
i
sent
her
home
in
the
dogcart
but
arden
go
look
after
the
road
edgar
managed
to
shout
to
him
at
last
across
the
farmyard
arthur
took
no
further
thought
about
keeping
jeanie
quiet
except
indeed
that
he
gave
johnny
timms
sixpence
to
stand
and
watch
at
the
corner
of
the
road
edgar
however
was
on
the
spot
before
he
had
gone
quite
away
he
saw
the
work
proceeding
as
he
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
red
house
and
asked
himself
with
a
half
sneer
at
his
cousin
a
half
wonder
for
himself
what
made
the
difference
edgar
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
accident
and
yet
was
taking
all
this
trouble
to
repair
it
whereas
he
who
was
really
involved
in
it
after
the
first
moment
never
dreamed
of
taking
any
trouble
what
was
the
use
indeed
of
thus
troubling
self
about
others
he
had
been
weakly
foolishly
compunctious
at
the
first
moment
why
could
he
not
have
left
jeanie
to
edgar
why
should
he
have
concerned
himself
at
all
about
her
why
for
her
sake
a
girl
who
had
never
even
given
him
a
smile
should
he
have
committed
himself
thus
with
the
pimpernels
arthur
arden
cursed
his
own
folly
and
the
impulse
which
had
made
him
snatch
up
jeanie
in
his
arms
instead
of
alice
edgar
was
there
who
would
have
done
it
and
taken
all
the
responsibility
and
such
a
piece
of
quixotism
would
not
harm
edgar
there
was
the
difference
not
in
the
nature
as
that
insolent
doctor
insinuated
but
in
the
fact
that
edgar
could
afford
to
be
helpful
and
liberal
and
generous
that
it
could
do
him
no
harm
whereas
he
arthur
dependent
upon
circumstances
obliged
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
this
one
to
curry
favour
with
that
to
consider
how
everything
would
affect
his
own
interests
did
not
venture
to
be
helpful
and
sympathetic
that
was
the
true
explanation
of
the
whole
a
man
when
he
is
rich
can
afford
to
be
better
kinder
more
than
a
man
who
is
poor
and
above
all
the
man
who
lives
by
his
wits
is
the
man
least
capable
of
sacrifices
for
others
arthur
arden
was
very
sorry
for
himself
as
he
went
reluctantly
yet
quickly
through
the
shrubberies
of
the
red
house
he
knew
he
had
a
quart
before
him
however
eager
or
anxious
he
might
manage
to
look
he
knew
very
well
that
the
father
and
mother
would
never
forgive
him
for
having
left
their
child
to
take
her
chance
while
he
cared
for
the
little
village
girl
he
cursed
his
unhappy
impulsiveness
as
he
approached
the
house
of
the
pimpernels
taking
trouble
about
other
people
was
always
a
mistake
unless
they
were
people
who
could
repay
that
care
could
not
he
have
left
jeanie
alone
to
take
her
chance
was
not
jeanie
somehow
at
the
bottom
of
caprice
which
had
thrown
out
all
his
calculations
a
week
ago
and
now
again
no
doubt
she
had
ruined
him
with
the
pimpernels
poor
arthur
arden
if
he
had
been
the
squire
he
would
have
been
above
all
these
miserable
calculations
all
these
apprehensions
and
regrets
the
least
sympathetic
spectator
could
scarcely
have
refrained
from
a
sentiment
of
pity
for
the
unfortunate
schemer
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
red
house
end
of
vol
ii
