preface
in

the
following
pages
the
author
has
spent
pleasant
hours
which
perhaps
might
have
been
less
profitably
employed
if
anything
of
interest
be
found
among
them
it
is
well
and
should
any
be
led
to
take
up
their
cross
in
meekness
and
humility
searching
out
the
path
that
leads
the
wanderer

it
is

natalie
chapter
i
the
what
was
it
that
i
loved
so
well
about
my
childhood
home
it
was
the
wide
and
shore
the
black
rocks
crowned
with
foam
it
was
the
flapping
wing
all
trackless
in
its
flight
its
screaming
note
that
welcomed
on
the
fierce
and
stormy
night
the
wild
heath
had
its
flowers
and
moss
the
forest
had
its
trees
which
bending
to
the
evening
wind
made
music
in
the
breeze
but
earth
ha
ha
i
laugh
now
earth
had
no
charms
for
me
nor
scene
half
bright
enough
to
win
my
young
heart
from
the
sea
no
was
the
ocean
vast
and
deep
the
fathomless
the
free
the
mighty
rushing
waters
that
were
ever
dear
to
me
eliza
cook
but
the
goodly
pearl
which
the
merchant
bought
and
for
which
his
all
he
gave
was
a
purer
pearl
than
will
be
brought
from
under
the
foaming

and
as
he
spoke
the
little
one
stretched
out
its
tiny
arms
toward
the
poor
old
black
man
and
gave
a
faint
moan
captain
grosvenor
who
had
now
come
up
with
the
negro
was
no
less
surprised
than
had
been
old
vingo
at
discovering
among
the
fresh
bright
an
infant
some
eight
months
old
the
babe
was
carefully
lashed
into
a
large
wooden
trough
or
bowl
and
a
canvas
firmly
stretched
over
the
top
permitting
only
the
head
and
arms
to
remain
exposed
and
judging
from
the
dripping
condition
of
the
worthy
little
it
could
not
have
been
many
moments
since
it
had
come
to
anchor
on
the
smooth
hard
beach
probably
the
now
receding
waves
had
borne
the
precious
burden
to
this
most
welcome
harbor
whereby
hangs
a
tale
de
good
lord
be
praised

but
dis
am

curous
ob

used
to

in
old
church
hung
up
ober
de
minister
head
to
make
de
good
psalms
or
de
prayers
go
de
right
way
and
i
do
remember
which
old
bingo
always
retained
a
bery
bad
memory
eber
since
before
he
was
a
child
but
i
tink
dey
used
to
call
it
a
sound
board
though
it
was
full
ob
cracks
ah
poor
fellow
had
you
seen
that
look
of
despair
mingled
with
sweet
resignation
upon
the
face
of
that
mother
had
you
seen
the
glistening
tear
in
the
eye
of
that
noble
father
as
but
a
few
hours
before
they
consigned
their
idolized
child
to
the
mercies
of
the
deep
had
you
heard
that
prayer
to
god
if
it
might
be
his
will
to
spare
their
darling
from
an
your
great
heart
would
have
been
if
possible
kindled
to
a
greater
love
for
that
helpless
little
one
captain
grosvenor
after
having
carefully
taken
the
child
from
the
grotesque
looking
craft
which
had
proved
so
trustworthy
a
sailor
and
wiped
the
drops
of
spray
from
its
little
face
wrapped
it
in
a
large
bandana
and
gave
it
to
the
faithful
vingo
while
he
took
his
glass
and
scanned
the
distant
horizon
for
well
did
he
know
though
even
at
that
one
more
unfortunate
bark
had
gone
down
near
that
dread
nantucket
shoal
upon
which
so
many
noble
hearts
have
found
a
watery
grave
i
see
nothing
said
the
captain
nothing
not
even
a
passing
sail
which
is
quite
uncommon
at
this
season
when
so
many
vessels
are
constantly
passing
and
repassing
our
island
not
even
the
do
i
see
which
is
probably
owing
to
a
fog
coming
in
from
the
sea
as
yet
imperceptible
to
us
here
poor
fellows
i
fear
they
have
gone
down
without
a
soul
to
help
them
it
seems
hard
when
there
are
so
many
stout
hearts
and
ready
arms
here
willing
to
risk
their
lives
in
the
attempt
to
save
those
shoals
vingo
are
the
only
unkind
thing
there
is
about
our
cherished
island
but
the
will
of
god
be
done
truly
his
ways
are
unsearchable
den
you
tinks
massa
dis
little
was
left
here
trough
mistake
by
de
lord
it
most
assuredly
was
left
here
by
the
lord
vingo
but
not
by
mistake
the
fact
is
my
boy
there
has
been
a
wreck
off
to
the
east
of
the
island
probably
some
vessel
has
mistaken
her
bearings
or
being
unacquainted
with
the
coast
has
run
on
to
the
shoals
and
gone
to
pieces
and
this
infant
was
made
fast
to
the
first
floatable
object
that
could
be
found
and
with
a
mother
dying
prayer
for
a
rudder
and
the
hand
of
him
who
guides
us
all
at
the
helm
she
has
come
to
us
here
and
with
eyes
of
heaven
own
blue
she
silently
asks
for
that
protection
which
shall
not
be
withheld
from
her
so
long
as
it
shall
be
within
my
power
to
give
and
now
vingo
boy
you
may
turn
the
horse
head
for
the
town
yes
massa
and
though
some
fifty
years
had
passed
over
the
old
negro
head
he
sprang
with
the
agility
of
boyhood
days
although
as
the
poor
fellow
often
remarked
he
had
a
wonderful
constitution
for
enduring
rest
the
thought
of
his
good
missus
surprise
when
she
should
learn
of
their
morning
adventure
gave
him
new
life
and
he
fairly
danced
about
the
beach
for
joy
seated
in
the
captain
grosvenor
took
the
babe
in
his
arms
that
had
now
fallen
into
a
quiet
sleep
while
vingo
perching
himself
first
on
one
foot
and
then
the
other
to
keep
his
balance
gathered
up
the
reins
and
all
started
for
home
i
am
tinking
massa
dat
my
missus
be
quite
at
de
sight
of
dis
little
yes
boy
yes
indeed
i
have
travelled
the
wide
world
from
stem
to
stern
but
never
have
i
met
with
such
an
emblem
of
innocence
before
and
though
the
hardy
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
among
the
whales
he
stooped
down
and
pressed
his
lips
to
the
brow
of
the
unconscious
sleeper
luff
off
there
a
little
vingo
keep
to
the
right
these
bare
commons
are
not
the
easiest
grounds
to
ride
over
though
with
a
light
like
this
one
can
navigate
with
some
degree
of
comfort
the
broad
ocean
is
the
place
after
all
give
me
the
old
ship
tantalizer
and
i
am
at
home
take
the
glass

and
see
if
you

up
old
massachusetts

will
be
in
early
travels
decently
fast
considering
she
is
all
out
of
joint
i
hope
we
shall
get
a
new
steamer
some
day
then
we
may
keep
posted
with
what
is
going
on
in
the
outer
world
yes
massa
people
tink
we
a
piece
ob
de
continent
den
an
hour
ride
brought
our
worthy
captain
to
his
own
door
where
stood
grosvenor
with
her
son
harry
their
only
child
of
seven
years
awaiting
him
you
have
made
a
long
stay
at
the
shore
this
morning
my
husband
but
if
these
little
excursions
will
deter
you
from
making
a
longer
voyage
i
will
not
complain
yes
wife
yes
but
for
a
peace
offering
i
have
brought
to
you
a
gem
from
among
the
my
dear
husband
where
can
you
have
found
this
child
and
tears
were
in
the
eyes
of
the
lady
as
she
received
the
little
unknown
from
his
arms
is
it
for
you
to
be
yours
mother
mother
may
it
stay
with
us
here
asked
harry
and
in
his
delight
he
stumbled
over
old
neptune
who
was
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
floor
and
the
two
went
rolling
over
and
over
first
one
up
and
then
the
other
till
finally
the
boy
came
off
victorious
seated
astride
the
animal
back
who
marched
up
to
grosvenor
side
where
they
both
remained
eyeing
the
little
stranger
in
silence
the
child
dress
denotes
no
common
birth
remarked
the
captain
as
his
lady
disrobed
it
of
its
rich
lace
dress
saturated
with
the
salt
seawater
and
the
gold
bands
are
there
no
marks
nothing
by
which
we
may
gain
the
least
clue
of
its
history
i
see
nothing
and
it
is
well
for
my
heart
already
yearns
towards
the
little
creature
and
in
my
selfish
human
nature
i
ca
but
hope
that
we
may
be
able
to
keep
her
for
our
own
and
as
she
spoke
she
pressed
the
clasp
of
the
band
and
behold
the
miniature
likeness
of
a
lady
was
brought
to
view
the
foster
mother
gazed
upon
those
features
as
if
it
were
the
face
of
an
angel
i
can
not
have
the
heart
to
wish
to
retain
child
to
deprive
that
mother
of
anything
that
can
give
her
pain
to
lose
would
i
could
ask
her
to
forgive
my
cruel
thoughts
forgive
the
desire
to
retain
this
her
gem
but
i
know
she
has
gone
to
her
home
in
the
skies
she
was
too
pure
for
earth
yes
this
must
be
the
mother
the
child
is
so
like
her
the
same
features
the
same
expression
and
said
the
captain
i
will
use
every
means
of
finding
out
if
there
is
one
left
of
that
crew
to
tell
the
tale
it
will
probably
be
reported
in
a
few
days
if
there
are
any
missing
vessels
either
from
our
coasts
or
foreign
ports
in
the
meantime
i
will
take
care
to
have
this
discovery
registered
at
and
then
if
we
can
discover
no
trace
of
her
parentage
we
may
have
her
for
our
own
have
her
for
our
own
nep
do
you
hear
that
we
are
to
have
a
new
sister
shouted
the
boy
and
nep
as
if
comprehending
his
young
master
words
laid
his
great
honest
face
on
the
feet
of
the
child
and
caressed
her
please
missus
do
make
little
too
fresh
she
be
pining
for
de
sea
remarked
vingo
as
grosvenor
proceeded
to
bathe
the
child
in
cool
fresh
water
and
having
brought
out
the
worn
by
harry
she
was
soon
by
the
aid
of
a
little
new
milk
made
comfortable
and
creeping
down
after
old
nep
sat
with
her
hands
buried
in
his
shaggy
coat
crowing
with
delight
the
lights
at
captain
grosvenor
burned
long
into
the
night
of
that
eventful
day
of
the
discovery
of
the
while
he
related
to
his
wife
how
they
had
found
the
little
one
among
the
and
in
forming
plans
for
her
future
adoption
should
nothing
be
learned
of
her
parentage
and
no
friends
come
to
claim
the
child
soon
after
the
commencement
of
our
story
a
fearful
storm
swept
the
new
england
coast
seem
as
if
the
rage
of
the
knew
no
bounds
and
many
hearts
there
were
made
desolate
in
that
september
gale
fragments
of
wrecks
came
ashore
on
different
parts
of
the
island
together
with
casks
chests
rigging
stoven
boats
which
were
picked
up
in
various
places
and
by
various
characters
some
would
watch
eagerly
for
these
trophies
of
destruction
and
with
grasping
hand
seize
upon
them
viewing
the
storm
as
sent
for
their
own
particular
benefit
increasing
their
worldly
goods
regardless
of
others
woes
while
some
there
were
who
turned
away
with
a
heart
sick
at
the
scene
of
devastation
yet
submissively
bowing
to
his
will
who
holds
the
waters
in
his
hand
wreck
upon
wreck
was
reported
the
total
loss
of
vessels
from
all
parts
of
the
world
was
very
great
which
only
served
to
increase
the
mystery
in
regard
to
the
unknown
which
went
down
a
calm
sky
days
and
months
passed
on
and
still
no
tidings
till
finally
they
came
to
look
upon
the
loved
one
as
their
own
the
child
grew
in
strength
and
beauty
and
was
a
source
of
great
amusement
to
them
all
old
vingo
would
delight
to
make
one
of
his
squantums
as
he
called
it
to
the
shore
and
with
master
harry
who
was
now
taking
his
first
lessons
in
driving
a
point
once
attained
boyhood
thinks
to
gain
no
higher
and
in
his
arms
with
nep
who
is
determined
to
be
head
horse
bounding
off
in
the
distance
is
happiness
enough
for
the
negro
and
his
white
teeth
glisten
in
the
bright
sunshine
like
so
many
african
pearls
as
he
jabbers
away
to
as
if
she
were
comprehending
the
whole
but
was
enough
for
vingo
that
she
in
reply
to
his
half
hour
remarks
would
put
out
her
hand
toward
the
blue
waters
and
with
eyes
dilated
with
wonderment
would
say
tee
indo
tee
there
on
the
beach
they
would
have
a
fine
race
with
the
surf
vingo
following
with
the
child
the
receding
wave
and
then
as
it
came
in
with
a
roar
from
the
sea
he
would
run
as
if
pursued
by
a
foe
sometimes
the
spray
dashing
up
all
around
them
much
to
the
joy
of
the
her
merry
laugh
according
strangely
with
the
music
of
the
waters
harry
amused
himself
for
a
while
throwing
the
bits
of
into
the
water
that
he
might
see
old
newfoundland
dash
in
and
combat
with
the
waves
to
secure
the
prize
which
he
never
failed
to
do
but
wearying
of
this
he
came
and
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
his
sister
and
commenced
whittling
diligently
on
an
old
piece
of
plank
vingo
do

think
my
father
will
ever
go
to
sea
again

ship

never
hear
of
a
ship

at
the
bar
but
it
sends
a
thrill
of
delight
over
me
and
i
watch
the
sailors
as
they
come
on
shore
after
a
three
years
voyage
and
think
how
happy
they
must
be

they
look
as
if
they
had
met
with
the
rubbers

shall

many
days
after

went
away

little

i
remember
my
father
took
me
in
his
arms

told
me

be
a
good
boy
and
take
care
of

much
on
the
water
not
a
great
deal
i
used
to
take
old
massa
wid
his
children
out
for
a
sail
sometimes
and
den
i
hab
a
slight
recollection
ob
being
brought
from
a
great
way
off
but
dat
must
hab
been
before
i
come
to
be
berry
great
de
pleasantest
sail
i
eber
take
was
when
i
leabe
old
berginny
in
de
good
tantalizer
and
i
swings
my
hat
at
old
slabe
massa
on
de
bank
and
asks
him
if
he
do
wish
he
as
free
as
dis
individual
dat
was
but
a
few
years
ago
den
you
wear
little
dress
like
and
now
you
talk
going
to
sea
well
dat
am
de
way
wid
you
here
as
the
three
sat
on
the
beach
enjoying
the
morning
breeze
harry
observed
a
gentleman
not
far
off
who
appeared
to
be
taking
sketches
of
the
scenery
around
and
occasionally
would
give
a
glance
towards
where
our
little
party
were
sitting
somewhat
to
the
disquietude
of
nep
who
came
and
stood
sentinel
as
much
as
to
say
i
will
protect
you
but
finding
the
stranger
disposed
to
do
them
no
harm
he
composed
himself
for
a
nap
the
whittling
process
being
now
finished
harry
produced
what
he
termed
a
the
which
vingo
declared
it
would
be
no
sin
to
worship
as
it
was
not
in
the
likeness
of
anything
she
is
not
a
very
polished
looking
craft
to
be
sure
but
i
know
she
is
a
sailer
for
all
that
at
any
rate
she
shall
be
of
some
service
and
he
seized
old
nep
by
the
ear
and
making
fast
his
dogship
to
the
little
ark
he
carefully
seated
the
at
the
helm
and
with
vingo
rainbow
bandana
flying
from
the
they
were
soon
under
full
headway
either
nep
being
proud
of
his
charge
or
the
little
one
mistaking
the
thoughtful
face
lit
up
with
the
glow
of
enthusiasm
of
the
stranger
for
a
beacon
light
they
came
up
with
him
who
called
to
harry
to
join
them
what
is
your
name
my
son
harry
grosvenor
sir
answered
the
boy
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
what
have
you
here
added
he
i
suppose
you
came
along
as
supercargo
pray
tell
me
with
what
are
you
freighted
the
is
my
only
freight
sir
and
god
grant
that
you
may
always
find
as
valuable
but
tell
me
is
this
angelic
child
your
sister
yes
sir
my
sister
and
we
all
love
her
very
much
we
could
not
be
without
her
for
we
might
forget
to
thank
our
father
for
his
kindness
to
us
if
we
had
no
to
remind
us
of
heaven
so
young
and
can
appreciate
so
rare
a
gift
mused
the
gentleman
childhood
indeed
is
the
first
to
discover
purity
and
the
eye
of
the
stranger
grew
moist
and
the
melancholy
smile
which
sat
upon
his
countenance
gave
place
to
the
shadows
of
grief
what
is
the
name
asked
he
we
call
her
sir
is
a
peculiar
sweet
name
but
has
she
no
other
we
have
always
called
her
by
that
name
mother
says
she
came
to
us
from
god
and
he
loves
the
little
flowers
he
smiles
upon
each
one
as
it
holds
up
its
little
head
all
shining
with
pearly
tears
wept
by
the
stars
but
do
you
not
love
my
sister
i
did
not
think
she
could
make
you
sad
yes
yes
my
son
take
good
care
of
her
be
a
true
brother
to
her
ever
many
long
years
have
passed
since
my
own
little
natalie
played
in
my
arms
but
they
are
gone
and
the
kind
gentleman
gathered
his
sketching
instruments
to
depart
that
night
as
grosvenor
talked
with
her
children
as
was
her
wont
of
the
good
father
who
loves
us
all
harry
related
the
interview
with
the
stranger
gentleman
and
in
the
prayer
which
followed
he
was
not
forgotten
the
folded
her
tiny
hands
meekly
while
from
the
windows
of
her
soul
went
up
the
love
she
could
not
speak
as
that
faithful
mother
sat
meditating
upon
the
story
of
harry
in
regard
to
the
stranger
which
she
had
related
to
her
husband
captain
grosvenor
remarked
it
is
just
one
year
when
our
dear
child
came
to
us
being
also
my
birthday
but
instead
of
adding
a
year
to
my
life
it
seems
to
me
old
father
time
has
made
a
mistake
and
made
a
deduction
of
a
year
just
one
year
and
she
is
the
still
yes
she
will
ever
be
the
to
us
yet
i
suppose
she
must
have
a
name
more
in
keeping
with
the
ideas
of
the
world
what
was
the
name
of
the
lost
one
the
sad
gentleman
mused
of
he
spoke
of
the
long
time
ago
before
his
own
natalie
had
gone
poor
man
each
life
must
have
its
portion
of
bitterness
natalie
i
like
the
sound
it
reminds
me
of
my
home
on
the
waters
with
your
consent
my
wife
the
christian
name
of
the
child
shall
be
natalie
for
she
came
to
us
from
the
sea
chapter
ii
the
island
home
long
may
this
be
bright
and
long
may
it
be
fair
in
freedom
pure
and
blessed
light
and
virtue
hallowed
air
while
still
across
its
ocean
bound
shall
be
borne
the
truthful
sound
our
island
home
our
island
home
we
love
our
island
home
hanaford
and
yet
that
isle
remaineth
a
refuge
for
the
free
as
when
macy
beheld
it
from
the
sea
god
bless
the
island
and
grant
for
evermore
that
charity
and
freedom
dwell
as
now
upon
the
shore
whittier
gentle
reader
pause
a
little
and
let
us
for
a
few
moments
turn
our
thoughts
toward
that
island
of
the
sea
upon
which
it
was
the
fate
of
our
heroine
through
the
guidance
of
a
divine
providence
to
find
a
home
in
the
bosoms
of
those
whose
hearts
beatings
were
of
love
for
our
unknown
yea
love
ever
encircleth
purity
properly
this
chapter
descriptive
of
the
island
of
nantucket
should
have
been
our
first
but
had
that
been
the
case
alas
for
the
simple
tale
of
natalie
how
many
would
have
passed
it
by
with
but
one
thought
and
that
thought
invariably
nantucket
pooh
a
fish
story
strikingly
embellished
with
ignorance
and
you
may
indeed
discover
in
the
feebleness
of
my
unpretending
pen
much
that
is
food
for
critics
yet
give
not
a
thought
of
ridicule
to
nantucket
favored
ones
for
it
is
not
for
me
to
enlist
under
her
banner
of
superiority
of
intellect
to
the
many
questions
which
i
know
you
have
it
in
your
heart
to
ask
as
touching
the
civilization
of
these
islanders
i
do
not
reply
as
i
might
be
tempted
under
other
circumstances
to
do
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
procure
a
passport
before
landing
on
those
shores
lest
one
might
stand
in
danger
of
being
harpooned
by
the
natives
but
rather
let
me
in
as
correct
a
light
as
i
may
set
forth
to
those
who
have
heretofore
known
but
little
of
those
who
inhabit
that
triangular
bit
of
land
in
the
wide
ocean
which
when
we
were
six
year
olds
we
passed
over
on
our
maps
with
the
thought
i
wonder
if
they
have
sundays
there
situated
nearly
one
hundred
miles
in
a
course
from
the
city
of
boston
and
about
thirty
miles
from
the
nearest
point
of
main
land
nantucket
lifts
her
proud
head
from
out
the
broad
atlantic
whose
waters
even
when
lashed
to
madness
have
been
kind
to
her
and
now
on
this
oppressive
july
morning
let
us
throw
aside
our
cares
and
come
out
from
our
daily
round
of
duties
where
we
have
been
scaling
with
our
eyes
the
tall
brick
barriers
which
shut
out
god
beautiful
blue
sky
and
sunshine
yes
let
us
off
anywhere
to
get
one
glimpse
of
nature
on
board
the
good
steamer
island
home
a
two
hours
sail
carries
us
over
that
distance
which
separates
cape
cod
from
nantucket
if
you
have
not
passed
most
of
your
days
among
the
connecticut
hills
you
pay
little
attention
to
that
monster
who
considers
it
a
part
of
his
duty
to
prepare
the
uninitiated
for
the
good
time
coming
arrived
at
the
bar
which
stretches
itself
across
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
our
first
impressions
take
to
themselves
the
forms
of
sundry
venerable
windmills
church
spires
and
towers
representing
various
orders
of
architecture
but
that
which
strikes
us
most
is
the
scarcity
of
shipping
not
more
than
a
dozen
vessels
lying
at
the
wharves
in
former
times
nantucket
numbered
as
many
whaleships
belonging
to
her
port
as
did
any
town
on
our
seaboard
indeed
she
was
built
up
from
the
produce
of
the
ocean
and
carried
the
palm
for
years
as
being
first
among
the
american
whale
fisheries
but
her
number
has
dwindled
away
till
not
of
those
ships
are
destined
for
the
port
of
nantucket
the
town
we
find
is
situated
on
the
northern
shore
of
the
island
at
the
harbor
head
the
houses
are
compact
and
most
of
them
built
of
wood
with
little
regard
to
beauty
though
some
few
residences
there
are
of
modern
style
which
do
credit
to
their
designers
but
the
greater
number
speak
only
of
antiquity
with
their
shingled
sides
and
you
will
rarely
see
a
house
that
has
not
a
walk
upon
its
roof
with
which
they
could
by
no
means
dispense
as
in
case
of
near
the
island
the
roofs
of
the
whole
town
will
be
alive
with
men
women
and
children
spyglass
in
hand
besides
the
town
there
are
but
one
or
two
small
villages
polpis
and
the
siaconset
or
sconset
as
it
is
usually
termed
numbering
some
four
dozen
houses
this
village
is
seven
and
miles
from
the
town
affording
a
delightful
place
of
recreation
for
families
from
town
who
as
the
summer
holidays
come
round
harness
up
old
dobbin
and
prepare
for
a
six
weeks
siesta
if
by
reason
of
the
great
financial
pressure
you
find
you
have
not
sufficient
to
take
you
for
a
short
tour
to
europe
come
to
sconset
it
is
a
glorious
place
take
a
stroll
along
that
grand
old
beach
and
watch
the
moon
rise
from
out
the
ocean
then
go
to
your
comfortable
lodgings
which
seems
like
a
palace
draw
the
comfortable
rug
about
you
and
fall
asleep
with
old
ocean
for
a
lullaby
to
dream
if
your
waking
hours
are
fortunately
of
that
bent
of
some
old
deserted
castle
salem
witchcraft
or
a
lone
grace
pool
attendant
within
the
attic
most
remote
recesses
the
face
of
the
island
is
level
so
much
so
that
the
flat
bare
commons
resemble
somewhat
our
western
prairies
and
with
the
exception
of
the
cliffs
at
the
north
and
sancoty
head
there
are
but
few
slight
elevations
owing
to
the
peculiar
shape
of
the
island
its
two
arms
stretching
far
out
on
either
side
it
does
not
appear
to
be
as
large
as
it
really
is
being
about
sixteen
miles
long
and
four
wide
affording
sufficient
elbow
room
however
for
its
eight
thousand
inhabitants
the
soil
is
sandy
but
is
cultivated
to
some
extent
and
though
they
can
boast
of
no
extensive
forests
yet
you
may
occasionally
meet
with
an
old
friend
in
the
way
of
a
noble
elm
or
the
pensive
weeping
willow
the
culture
of
fruit
trees
also
is
receiving
much
attention
of
later
years
and
as
widely
as
refinement
must
be
separated
from
the
islanders
to
be
in
keeping
with
your
views
their
love
for
the
sweet
spring
flowers
knows
no
bounds
in
your
walks
of
curiosity
about
town
you
meet
with
a
great
many
of
the
denomination
termed
friends
or
quakers
and
as
you
pass
them
you
can
not
refrain
from
giving
them
the
inside
walk
for
their
very
garb
is
of
humility
and
as
you
look
into
the
placid
face
of
some
matron
you
feel
like
uncovering
yourself
for
you
can
see
the
innocence
looking
out
of
her
eyes
you
are
curious
to
know
whither
so
many
are
wending
their
way
and
meeting
a
he
tells
you
it
is
fifth
day
and
if
you
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
slick
bonnets
they
will
pilot
you
to
their
nearest
but
precious
little
light
you
will
get
unless
the
spirit
move
some
of
them
to
pick
up
the
wick
you
move
on
with
the
rest
till
you
come
to
their
house
of
worship
which
appears
as
humble
as
those
who
enter
its
doors
as
you
contrast
the
plainness
on
all
sides
with
the
richly
decorated
edifice
in
which
you
have
been
accustomed
to
worship
you
try
to
smile
a
smile
of
contempt
at
the
scene
but
can
not
for
you
feel
that
the
spirit
of
christ
is
in
their
midst
and
though
not
a
word
is
spoken
during
the
hour
and
a
half
yet
you
feel
that
the
silent
worship
which
went
up
to
heaven
was
heard
by
him
who
answers
prayer
as
a
signal
for
dispersing
the
elders
who
occupy
the
rising
seats
arise
and
shake
hands
and
you
go
your
way
with
those
silent
ones
feeling
that
their
worship
was
acceptable
to
god
the
quakers
of
nantucket
are
rapidly
diminishing
in
number
formerly
perhaps
of
the
population
were
of
the
society
of
friends
but
now
not
are
of
that
denomination
as
their
children
come
up
they
are
not
true
to
the
faith
as
were
their
fathers
and
they
put
off
the
plain
garb
for
the
fashions
of
the
day
a
quaker
in
nantucket
will
in
time
come
to
be
a
great
curiosity
their
places
will
we
fear
be
filled
by
none
more
upright
heaven
bless
them
nantucket
of
the
present
is
not
nantucket
of
the
past
her
quaint
has
given
place
to
customs
and
manners
more
in
accordance
with
things
yet
her
originality
has
not
entirely
forsaken
her
she
has
a
character
even
now
peculiar
to
herself
the
wild
waves
come
tumbling
in
their
glad
shouts
ringing
through
the
midnight
stillness
with
the
same
zest
as
of
yore
and
the
same
starry
skies
which
looked
down
on
the
fair
maiden
of
a
century
ago
still
bend
over
her
children
children
as
they
tread
along
life
rugged
way
occasionally
you
may
meet
with
one
who
has
long
since
passed
the
meridian
of
life
one
perhaps
who
has
never
been
off
of
the
island
of
his
birth
and
he
will
tell
you
of
the
nantucket
of
the
past
before
her
peaceful
shores
had
been
invaded
by
the
stranger
when
they
might
lay
them
down
to
sleep
without
thought
of
bolt
or
bar
save
old
faithful
bands
you
will
learn
of
nantucket
from
the
beginning
down
to
the
present
time
then
the
island
was
big
with
prosperity
her
sons
were
not
obliged
to
leave
their
homes
for
a
five
years
voyage
in
search
of
the
monster
from
which
they
gained
their
chief
maintenance
for
there
were
then
good
fishing
grounds
near
the
shore
and
often
the
whale
might
be
seen
from
their
little
island
spouting
off
in
the
distance
and
their
ships
came
proudly
bearing
down
to
the
bar
laden
heavily
with
the
good
sperm
oil
and
all
hearts
were
made
lighter
and
each
purse
heavier
with
every
new
arrival
of
good
fortune
as
if
they
had
been
one
great
family
each
one
smiling
on
another
prosperity
but
now
and
the
face
of
the
narrator
is
less
joyous
as
he
turns
from
to
things
are
not
what
they
were
our
island
is
becoming
like
what
they
tell
me
the
world
at
large
is
and
the
old
man
will
his
pipe
and
with
a
sad
smile
he
will
give
you
the
names
of
his
ancestors
from
his
great
down
to
more
modern
times
when
his
fifth
cousin
obed
was
a
large
ah
treat
such
of
other
days
with
kindness
for
the
style
of
that
day
will
never
come
again
their
great
hearts
of
brotherly
love
are
not
of
this
generation
yet
they
have
left
an
impress
upon
those
shores
that
can
never
be
entirely
erased
those
of
long
ago
combined
with
the
peculiarities
which
will
ever
dwell
with
these
children
of
the
sea
are
attractions
which
insure
to
the
stranger
on
his
first
visit
visions
of
many
a
happy
hour
in
the
future
and
he
will
long
for
the
season
to
return
which
shall
liberate
so
many
of
the
city
doomed
artificials
to
a
few
intercourse
with
nature
awakened
at
early
dawn
by
the
sailor
merry
yo
ho
coming
up
from
the
waters
with
the
sun
you
turn
your
eyes
seaward
and
what
a
glorious
sight
is
before
you
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
water
blue
rolling
water
tinged
with
rising
sunlight
in
its
morning
purity
the
folds
her
wings
which
she
has
laved
in
the
white
softening
the
sigh
of
the
breakers
to
the
ear
of
those
who
slumbered
the
white
sails
bow
their
heads
while
the
old
tars
wonder
what
makes
them
so
happy
with
these
pleasant
sunrise
impressions
you
go
forth
into
the
day
with
more
lenient
views
towards
the
land
of
whales
sniffing
the
salt
air
with
a
real
gusto
glancing
up
the
street
you
descry
an
object
in
the
distance
which
much
resembles
a
travelling
merchant
with
the
many
fancy
streamers
flying
in
the
breeze
but
as
it
draws
nearer
you
look
around
in
astonishment
for
barnum
fully
persuaded
if
that
worthy
is
not
on
the
ground
he
has
mistaken
his
calling
for
once
the
object
in
question
is
no
less
than
a
common
such
as
are
used
to
do
our
heavy
carting
except
this
is
on
springs
and
of
a
lighter
build
in
the
vehicle
are
some
half
dozen
ladies
standing
their
only
support
being
short
ropes
attached
to
the
sides
which
however
are
seldom
used
except
by
those
unaccustomed
to
this
kind
of
exercise
and
in
this
position
they
ride
with
the
greatest
ease
seldom
losing
their
balance
even
when
going
at
full
speed
thoroughly
initiated
and
having
seen
most
of
the
lions
of
the
place
you
find
yourself
becoming
more
and
more
attached
forget
that
you
have
ever
thought
of
the
island
as
anything
but
attractive
your
one
week
has
become
the
length
of
four
and
the
letters
to
anxious
friends
at
home
have
been
characteristic
of
briefness
unwilling
to
steal
a
time
from
the
enjoyment
which
will
furnish
a
topic
for
the
unemployed
hours
of
longer
days
to
come
of
the
many
excursions
which
have
made
short
the
hours
of
your
sojourn
here
i
will
not
enter
into
detail
suffice
it
to
say
you
have
been
disappointed
in
nantucket
and
its
inhabitants
you
have
made
many
firm
friends
the
memory
of
whom
will
stir
the
tear
of
unselfish
love
as
you
number
them
over
one
by
one
in
the
future
they
will
never
be
forgotten
you
have
found
nantucket
is
not
merely
an
isolated
place
where
oil
is
manufactured
where
the
people
only
work
to
eat
and
eat
to
work
though
as
some
have
suggested
a
carriage
drive
connecting
nantucket
with
the
continent
would
be
a
great
modern
improvement
as
one
has
quaintly
expressed
in
a
little
poem
entitled
an
old
story
before
columbus
ever
thought
of
western
world
with
glory
fraught
before
the
northmen
had
been
known
to
wander
from
their
native
zone
before
war
raised
a
single
mound
the
antiquarians
to
confound
indeed
so
very
long
ago
the
time
one
ca
exactly
know
a
giant
sachem
good
as
great
reigned
in
and
over
our
bay
state
so
huge
was
he
his
realm
so
small
he
could
not
exercise
at
all
except
by
taking
to
the
sea
for
which
he
had
a
ticket
free
granted
by
neptune
with
the
seal
a
salient
clam
and
couchant
eel
his
pipe
was
many
a
mile
in
length
his
lungs
proportionable
in
strength
and
his
rich
moccasins
with
the
pair
the
boots
would
not
compare
siestas
he
would
take
cape
cod
must
help
his
couch
to
make
and
being
lowly
it
was
meet
he
should
prefer
it
for
his
feet
well
one
day
after
quite
a
doze
a
month
or
two
in
length
suppose
he
waked
and
as
he
often
done
strolled
forth
to
see
the
sun
but
while
unconsciously
he
slept
the
sand
within
his
moccasins
crept
at
every
step
some
pain
he
feel
was
now
the
toe
now
near
the
heel
at
length
his
sachemship
grew
cross
the
pebbles
to
the
sea
he
toss
and
with
a
moccasin
in
each
hand
he
threw
on
either
side
the
sand
then
in
an
instant
there
appear
two
little
isles
the
sachem
near
one
as
the
vineyard
now
is
known
the
other
we
may
call
our
own
at
ease
he
freely
breathed
awhile
which
sent
the
fogs
to
bless
our
isle
and
turning
east
with
quickened
motion
the
chill
bleak
winds
came
the
ocean
sachem
would
that
you
had
never
shaken
that
shoe
or
having
done
so
would
again
and
join
nantucket
to
the
main
having
had
a
peep
within
the
nest
you
sigh
for
the
return
of
the
bird
and
we
will
on
chapter
iii
the
voice
of
childhood
ah
well
may
sages
bow
to
thee
dear
loving
guileless
infancy
and
sigh
beside
their
lofty
lore
for
one
untaught
delight
of
thine
and
feel
they
give
their
learning
store
to
know
again
thy
truth
divine
osgood
and
now
behold
him
kneeling
there
by
the
child
side
in
humble
prayer
while
the
same
shines
upon
the
guilty
and
the
guiltless
one
and
hymns
of
joy
proclaim
through
heaven
the
triumph
of
a
soul
forgiven
moore
lalla
rookh
mother
why
does
every
one
pass
poor
old
quady
by
without
giving
him
even
a
smile
is
not
that
the
reason
why
he
looks
so
sorrowful
he
looked
so
sad
when
i
met
him
this
afternoon
that
i
could
not
help
holding
out
the
daisies
which
i
had
gathered
for
you
towards
him
and
when
he
did
not
take
them
but
stood
looking
at
me
without
speaking
a
word
i
asked
him
if
he
did
not
want
the
flowers
to
carry
to
his
home
and
put
them
into
his
hand
and
when
i
had
come
up
with
the
who
had
run
away
when
they
saw
him
coming
i
looked
after
him
and
he
was
still
standing
by
the
with
the
flowers
in
his
hand
watching
us
as
we
went
up
the
street
perhaps
he
was
resting
a
little
for
it
is
a
long
way
to
the
low
home
over
the
commons
quady
my
dear
no
doubt
feels
that
he
is
alone
in
the
world
for
he
is
the
only
one
that
is
left
of
a
large
tribe
of
indians
all
of
his
kind
are
gone
and
are
buried
no
one
but
himself
knows
where
he
does
not
look
upon
the
pale
faces
as
brothers
though
they
treat
him
kindly
he
feels
that
wrong
has
been
shown
his
ancestors
at
their
hands
i
am
glad
my
child
that
you
were
kind
to
the
indian
yes
mother
i
love
everybody
but
i
think
i
love
those
best
who
look
as
if
no
one
cared
for
them
i
suppose
everybody
loves
poor
quady
only
they
forget
to
let
him
know
it
you
like
dat
old
ingin
why
he
almost
as
black
as
bingo
hesef
do
you
think
i
do
not
love
you
vingo
because
you
are
black
you
are
always
good
to
me
and
what
would
i
do
without
you
to
take
me
to
the
shore
whenever
i
like
to
go
o
little
missy
i
tink
you
can
sympetize
wid
old
black
bingo
but
den
ebry
body
not
like
you
you
one
ob
de
lord
chilen
hesef
we
are
all
the
lord
children
vingo
said
grosvenor
and
we
should
walk
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
that
we
may
be
worthy
of
his
name
you
may
go
now
what
does
vingo
mean
mother
he
talks
so
strangely
sometimes
about
my
being
left
here
by
the
lord
and
goes
on
muttering
something
to
himself
which
i
can
not
understand
and
laughs
as
if
he
was
very
happy
it
is
his
way
of
expressing
himself
my
dear
the
negroes
are
a
peculiar
race
yes
i
think
they
are
i
like
their
ways
they
are
always
so
kind
are
not
their
dispositions
better
than
those
of
some
white
people
i
never
heard
of
a
black
man
being
cruel
to
any
one
but
i
have
seen
the
prints
of
a
on
vingo
neck
where
he
said
his
old
massa
used
to
whip
him
and
i
asked
him
many
times
over
if
he
was
sure
it
was
a
white
man
who
whipped
him
and
he
said
yes
he
was
sure
for
he
remembers
he
used
to
wish
white
folks
were
black
so
they
could
not
tell
which
were
the
negroes
there
are
some
very
people
in
the
world
vingo
was
brought
up
in
slavery
when
you
are
a
little
older
you
will
understand
it
better
dear
mother
you
know
what
is
best
for
me
but
often
when
i
am
interested
in
what
is
said
and
ask
questions
people
tell
me
i
will
understand
it
when
i
am
a
little
older
and
when
i
sit
down
by
myself
and
they
think
i
have
forgotten
all
about
it
i
find
myself
wishing
i
was
a
little
older
for
it
disappoints
me
so
much
to
leave
a
story
not
finished
grosvenor
looked
at
the
child
in
silence
i
have
not
displeased
you
dear
mother
have
i
i
did
not
feel
that
i
was
saying
anything
wrong
no
darling
i
did
not
think
you
would
understand
me
that
was
the
reason
why
i
did
not
explain
to
you
i
am
always
ready
to
talk
with
you
if
you
can
comprehend
what
i
am
saying
never
mind
mother
i
am
six
years
old
it
wo
be
a
great
while
before
i
shall
be
little
older
and
then
i
can
realize
how
very
good
you
are
to
me
my
dear
mother
and
how
patient
you
are
grosvenor
clasped
the
child
in
her
arms
what
makes
little
pet
look
so
sober
asked
captain
grosvenor
as
taking
her
on
his
knee
he
pushed
the
dark
brown
curls
from
off
her
forehead
and
looked
into
her
mild
blue
eyes
what
makes
so
quiet
has
anything
happened
to
either
of
your
seven
kittens
or
has
some
flower
which
has
lived
already
a
week
longer
than
nature
designed
at
last
withered
and
gone
the
way
of
all
frailties
o
father
i
should
be
very
wicked
if
i
were
not
happy
when
i
have
so
much
to
make
me
so
but
sometimes
when
i
hear
the
shore
roaring
so
loud
as
it
does
this
evening
and
look
up
at
the
stars
as
they
twinkle
in
their
homes
far
away
in
the
sky
there
is
something
which
comes
over
me
of
sadness
making
me
a
great
deal
happier
and
there
is
one
particular
star
which
i
always
notice
for
it
seems
as
if
it
was
looking
down
at
me
so
gently
that
i
forget
myself
and
put
out
my
hand
to
touch
it
as
if
it
was
not
so
far
away
and
i
fancy
sometimes
that
the
star
can
read
my
thoughts
for
it
seems
to
smile
when
i
am
happiest
you
are
a
little
fanciful
creature
you
must
learn
to
leave
off
dreaming
when
you
are
awake
what
shall
you
dream
about
when
father
goes
away
to
sea
again
asked
harry
i
think
mother
will
not
let
him
go
we
can
not
spare
him
but
if
you
should
go
father
i
shall
love
to
dream
of
you
very
often
i
will
think
of
you
every
day
sailing
on
the
water
with
a
heart
so
light
o
it
must
be
so
pleasant
to
live
to
sleep
on
the
water
and
you
will
want
to
see
dear
mother
and
harry
when
you
are
so
far
away
you
will
not
forget
us
and
she
hid
her
cheek
in
the
hardy
captain
bosom
no
no
darling
i
sha
forget
you
but
we
wont
talk
any
more
about
it
now
i
have
not
gone
yet
what
was
it
made
that
stout
man
voice
tremulous
as
he
called
for
his
evening
paper
many
a
time
had
that
stern
voice
been
heard
above
the
hurricane
roar
giving
the
word
of
command
why
did
it
tremble
now
was
it
that
voice
of
childhood
which
sank
into
his
heart
missus
de
sun
hab
done
gone
now
de
chllens
hab
all
gone
from
school
long
ago
and
bingo
two
eyes

stretched
looking
up
de
road
for
de
remarked
that
worthy
putting
his
ebony
head
in
at
the
door
where
sat
grosvenor
so
busily
engaged
making
those
garments
for
her
husband
which
she
feared
would
be
needed
alas
so
soon
that
she
had
not
perceived
the
hours
were
gliding
on
apace
and
that
it
was
long
past
the
time
when
usually
came
tripping
in
from
school
to
receive
her
evening
kiss
and
to
tell
over
the
events
of
the
day
has
harry
come
home
yet
she
may
have
gone
up
to
the
high
school
to
meet
him
yes
missus
massa
harry
here
a
long
time
then
you
had
better
go
and
see
what
keeps
her
you
will
probably
meet
her
on
the
way
and
if
it
is
not
too
late
you
may
take
the
horse
and
give
her
a
ride
yes
missus
and
the
jet
pony
so
many
shades
lighter
than
his
driver
was
soon
lost
in
the
distance
the
last
faint
shadows
of
the
sun
had
died
away
the
moon
had
risen
in
all
her
queenly
beauty
and
vingo
had
not
returned
neither
had
anything
been
seen
of
the
since
she
had
left
home
early
in
the
afternoon
and
now
grosvenor
really
began
to
feel
anxious
as
she
stood
looking
out
into
the
night
for
although
the
child
was
accustomed
to
stroll
about
the
fields
in
search
of
wild
flowers
whenever
she
liked
she
had
never
before
stayed
away
so
long
husband
had
you
not
better
go
and
see
what
has
become
of
her
i
can
not
think
what
keeps
them
it
is
a
mystery
but
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
i
be
bound
the
child
has
made
a
safe
harbor
somewhere
she
usually
has
a
aloft
ah
there
they
come
under
a
full
press
of
sail
cried
harry
who
loved
well
to
imitate
the
nautical
phrases
of
his
father
does
she
not
make
a
grand
exclaimed
vingo
i
am
tinking
young
massa
if
dis
head
ob
mine
had
not
been
made
so
solid
like
for
figuring
dat

a
powerful
time
afore
you
cotch

ob
dis
bit
ob
again
de
good

praised
but
if

dat
she
make

ob
de

to
take

ober

it
make
me
smile
to
tink
how
dat
old
ingin
look
at
as
if
de
sun
was
puttin
out
his
eyes
why
my
child
you
surely
have
not
been
out
to
quady
hut
it
is
a
long
way
ha
a
fast
sailor
always
has
a
fair
breeze
dropped
anchor
in
the
best
harbor
in
these
parts
but
what
this
colors
exclaimed
the
captain
as
he
caught
sight
of
a
little
pouch
woven
together
of
bright
colored
basket
stuff
slung
over
her
shoulder
a
little
drab
paw
darting
from
out
its
deepest
recesses
in
pursuit
of
a
tantalizing
curl
soon
explains
how
matters
stand
and
a
voice
of
the
greatest
feline
sweetness
is
heard
in
reply
to
divers
catlike
salutations
proceeding
from
the
adjoining
apartment
this
is
my
wallet
which
quady
has
made
for
me
to
carry
my
kittens
in
and
pussy
has
enjoyed
it
so
much
is
the
way
quady
people
used
to
carry
their
babies
through
these
very
streets
only
there
were
prettier
walks
here
then
o
he
has
told
me
so
many
pretty
stories
how
came
you
to
have
your
kitten
with
you
and
why
did
you
go
away
so
far
and
stay
so
late
my
dear
i
have
been
looking
for
you
a
long
time
o
mother
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
as
i
was
bidding
my
kittens
after
having
a
little
talk
with
them
as
i
usually
do
before
going
to
school
i
missed
one
of
the
smallest
which
i
call
charity
because
she
always
looks
up
at
the
larger
ones
when
they
play
with
her
too
roughly
in
such
a
forgiving
way
i
looked
all
around
and
not
finding
her
thought
she
must
have
strayed
away
by
herself
and
i
ran
off
to
school
our
lesson
for
was
faith
hope
and
charity
as
i
read
the
last
word
i
looked
down
and
there
was
my
own
charity
peeping
at
me
from
out
my
pocket
i
explained
to
my
teacher
how
it
happened
for
i
thought
she
would
be
displeased
but
having
an
errand
into
the
next
room
just
then
she
did
not
think
of
kitten
who
lay
quietly
sleeping
again
and
when
i
had
said
all
my
lessons
my
teacher
excused
me
saying
it
was
because
i
had
been
a
good
girl
and
so
we
strolled
over
the
commons
together
charity
and
i
and
i
dressed
her
in
wild
flowers
and
she
did
look
so
innocent
on
we
went
i
running
after
kitten
and
then
kitten
after
me
when
before
i
thought
how
far
we
had
come
i
espied
quady
low
home
a
little
way
off
and
he
was
sitting
at
the
door
he
did
not
see
me
until
i
stood
before
him
and
then
he
went
into
his
house
and
brought
out
a
large
pipe
and
gave
to
me
i
thought
it
so
strange
that
poor
quady
should
think
a
little
girl
could
smoke
a
pipe
but
i
took
it
to
please
him
and
then
he
showed
me
so
many
curious
things
there
was
a
large
bow
and
arrows
with
sharp
bits
of
iron
in
their
heads
and
he
was
going
to
shoot
a
little
sparrow
which
sat
upon
the
fence
but
i
caught
his
arm
and
begged
him
not
to
kill
the
poor
thing
i
told
him
god
made
the
sparrow
to
be
happy
and
he
asked
me
if
i
meant
the
great
spirit
if
my
god
was
his
god
when
i
told
him
it
was
he
put
up
his
bow
and
came
and
sat
down
by
me
and
taking
a
little
paper
from
his
bosom
unrolled
it
and
there
were
the
daisies
which
i
had
given
him
so
long
ago
he
asked
if
the
great
spirit
made
them
too
and
if
he
had
sent
me
to
give
them
to
him
and
when
i
told
him
the
great
spirit
made
all
the
flowers
made
everything
and
loved
everybody
who
loved
him
and
that
he
would
let
his
children
all
come
home
and
live
with
him
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
he
said
me
see
my
brothers
then
me
not
be
all
alone
me
love
great
spirit
great
spirit
so
good
to
send
little
to
tell
me
how
to
get
home
then
i
could
not
help
crying
myself
mother
for
i
thought
i
should
like
to
meet
quady
brothers
there
ah
bress
de
lord
but
it
am
good
as
a
small
bible
to
hear
dat
chile
talk
was
heard
in
a
suppressed
voice
as
it
went
day
after
day
passed
and
that
little
one
was
often
seen
attended
by
old
nep
or
in
the
arms
of
the
faithful
vingo
on
her
way
to
the
low
home
over
the
commons
much
to
the
horror
of
sensitive
mothers
who
shook
their
heads
and
said
she
is
a
strange
child
never
was
happier
than
when
she
might
be
allowed
to
go
and
see
the
indian
and
it
was
indeed
a
strange
sight
to
see
that
red
man
the
only
representative
of
a
departed
tribe
gazing
upon
the
little
one
as
she
talked
to
him
of
jesus
and
his
word
the
autumn
of
the
year
had
come
it
was
one
of
those
days
in
october
which
can
not
fail
to
arouse
the
most
thoughtless
mind
to
a
sense
of
the
wonderful
works
of
creation
the
had
gone
to
the
low
home
over
the
commons
hand
in
hand
that
red
man
and
the
tender
child
they
went
their
way
to
where
he
pointed
out
the
graves
of
his
people
there
were
no
stones
not
a
mound
to
mark
the
spot
why
was
there
need
of
any
he
alone
knew
the
place
none
others
had
cared
to
know
until
now
when
the
number
of
his
days
had
been
told
this
little
child
of
a
summer
day
had
breathed
upon
those
springs
till
they
had
broken
their
bands
and
were
gliding
on
in
the
bright
smoothly
on
on
forever
there
did
the
indian
lay
him
down
where
he
would
have
them
bury
him
and
there
for
the
first
and
last
time
did
he
breathe
a
prayer
over
the
graves
of
the
departed
to
that
great
spirit
whom
he
had
been
taught
was
the
one
great
father
of
all
mother
poor
quady
is
not
so
strong
as
he
used
to
be
when
he
pounds
the
corn
to
make
nice
cakes
for
me
his
hands
tremble
and
i
notice
he
takes
all
the
broth
which
you
send
to
him
for
he
says
he
has
no
appetite
for
anything
else
it
was
a
holiday
a
great
display
of
military
had
arrived
from
the
continent
you
will
see
the
beautiful
horses
and
the
epaulets
the
white
plumes
and
the
shining
swords
but
they
need
not
think
to
turn
your
brain
with
all
their
splendor
brother
harry
i
should
like
to
see
all
those
splendid
things
but
i
had
much
rather
go
and
see
quady
it
is
several
days
since
i
have
been
there
and
we
have
such
good
times
i
love
to
talk
with
him
so
well
you
strange
little
creature
you
can
go
to
see
the
indian
any
time
yes
but
some
how
i
feel
as
if
i
would
like
to
go
i
know
he
will
like
to
see
me
and
the
child
was
soon
on
her
way
to
the
low
home
with
nep
who
carried
the
pail
of
broth
as
she
drew
near
she
saw
that
quady
was
not
sitting
at
his
door
as
he
usually
did
to
watch
for
her
but
instead
the
door
was
closed
and
everything
around
was
still
nothing
was
heard
save
the
breakers
as
they
dashed
upon
the
shore
opening
the
door
which
was
never
fast
she
saw
before
her
the
form
of
poor
quady
stretched
upon
the
rude
bed
and
as
he
tossed
to
and
fro
in
an
uneasy
slumber
he
muttered
the
words
gone
has
come
quady
has
come
to
you
look
up
and
take
some
of
the
nice
broth
which
i
have
brought
slowly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
seeing
the
little
one
was
by
his
side
he
raised
his
hands
aloft
and
said
me
thank
great
spirit
me
afraid
great
spirit
take
me
home
without
seeing
little
once
more
me
see
my
brothers
soon
a
little
while
and
come
to
see
us
great
spirit
bless
little
he
feebly
said
she
make
poor
quady
happy
with
that
dying
blessing
his
spirit
took
its
flight
he
had
passed
away
the
last
one
of
his
kind
he
who
had
lived
a
life
of
solitude
apart
from
the
world
looking
upon
the
white
man
as
having
taken
from
him
his
home
his
lands
and
the
forests
which
would
have
been
his
if
the
white
man
had
not
long
years
ago
laid
them
low
yes
he
had
breathed
a
blessing
with
his
last
breath
upon
the
he
who
had
not
a
brother
left
to
bury
him
had
thanked
god
that
the
had
come
to
close
his
eyes
yes
it
was
the
voice
of
childhood
which
had
made
his
last
moments
happy
had
pointed
out
the
road
which
leads
the
wanderer
home
it
was
a
scene
to
melt
the
hardest
heart
that
little
child
scarcely
as
high
as
the
rude
couch
reaching
up
to
close
the
eyes
of
him
whom
she
should
see
no
more
as
she
sat
by
his
side
and
looked
around
the
room
where
she
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
a
sense
of
loneliness
crept
over
her
there
was
the
pipe
which
he
had
smoked
laid
away
on
the
little
and
by
the
was
the
pail
of
broth
with
which
she
had
thought
to
please
him
so
much
and
at
the
remembrance
she
burst
into
tears
and
her
tears
fell
upon
the
hand
of
him
who
lay
sleeping
neptune
hearing
the
sad
tones
of
his
mistress
came
and
looked
into
her
face
and
when
she
took
no
notice
of
him
he
crouched
at
her
feet
and
howled
piteously
and
thus
they
found
them
for
the
little
one
could
not
think
of
leaving
her
dear
quady
there
alone
they
buried
him
as
he
had
wished
by
the
side
of
his
brothers
and
when
the
gazed
into
that
narrow
house
so
dark
and
still
she
looked
up
and
said
mother
i
shall
love
to
look
at
the
stars
oftener
now
for
he
has
gone
to
live
among
those
bright
and
shining
ones
sadly
did
the
child
miss
her
visits
to
the
low
home
and
when
in
years
to
come
her
thoughts
wandered
over
the
past
her
love
for
the
poor
lone
indian
had
not
diminished
the
stars
shone
brighter
and
brighter
even
as
her
light
was
shining
unto
the
perfect
day
what
little
missy
look
up
in
de
sky
so
much
for

walked
by

his
custom
of
a
bright
moonlit
evening
o
vingo
it
is
so
beautiful
i
was
watching
those
fleecy
clouds
until
they
seemed
to
be
little
waves
in
which
the
stars
were
sailing
upward
up
and
as
they
looked
back
to
us
their
smile
seemed
to
grow
purer
and
i
think
i
can
see

them

and
i
he
catch
bingo
and
tie
him
up
again
at
that
moment
a
shadow
was
seen
in
the
distance
and
harry
came
bounding
over
the
ground
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
ah
i
thought
i
should
find
you

the
acquaintance
of

said
vingo
letting
fall
his
lower
jaw
while
the
whites
of
his
eyes
looked
as
if
they
had
some
time
or
other
been
in
contact
with
a
ghost
i
mean
that
the
tantalizer
will
be
ready
for
sea
in
a
week
and
father
will
go
master
of
her
on
a
cape
horn
voyage
o
if

would
only
let
me
go
with
him
how
delighted
i
should
be
but
he
says
i
am
too
young
that
i
am
not
strong
enough
yet
i
know
of
boys
two
or
three
years
younger
than
i
am
who
have
been
around
cape
horn
and
are
now
making
a
second
voyage
i
have
often
heard
old
captain
wendall
tell
of
the
first
voyage
father
made
when
he
was
but
ten
years
old
and
how
nimbly
he
ran
up
to
the
and
was
always
the
first
to
discover
the
whale
as
she
spouted
and
would
sing
out
she
blows
equal
to
an
old
tar
i
must
prevail
on
father
to
let
me
go
with
him
dear
dear
harry
do
not
talk
so
only
think
how
mother
will
feel
to
have
father
go
he
has
been
at
home
so
long
ever
since
i
was
born
and
how
would
she
feel
to
have
you
both
go
away
and
no
one
but
vingo
and
myself
to
comfort
her
no
one
but
you
to
comfort
her
you
are
worth
a
dozen
like
me
darling
and
the
little
manly
fellow
threw
his
arms
around
her
neck
and
felt
that
he
had
the
very
best
sister
in
the
world
ah
young
massa
i
tinks
you
hab
de
right
sort
ob
spirit
you
born
to
be
no
but

my
you

better
stay
wid
good
kind
missus
and
de
a
while
longer

better
berth

that
i
shall
not
let
me
go
where
i
will
i
shall
not
find
a
mother
like
her
and
as
for
i
do
believe
there
was
ever
another
in
the
whole
ocean
like
her
how
funny
you
talk
harry
you
make
me
think
of
little
moses
in
the
bulrushes
ah
there
goes
a
gull
flying
over
my
right
shoulder
headed
seaward
the
sailor
omen
of
good
luck
perhaps
father
may
change
his
mind
after
all
harry
i
want
you
to
promise
me
you
will
say
nothing
about
going
to
sea
before
mother
will
you
promise
i
never
could
refuse
you
anything
little
pussy
but
you
do
not
say
anything
about
yourself
would
you
not
like
to
get
rid
of
such
a
graceless
fellow
the
child
sympathies
had
been
so
wrapped
up
in
her
mother
grief
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
mind
how
much
she
should
miss
her
dear
father
and
as
she
thought
of
harry
who
had
always
played
so
gently
with
her
and
came
every
night
after
her
mother
had
heard
her
prayers
and
told
such
beautiful
stories
about
the
good
little
fairies
until
she
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
they
had
all
come
to
be
her
sisters
and
was
awakened
in
the
morning
by
the
tramping
of
so
many
little
feet
in
near
proximity
to
those
brown
curls
which
seemed
to
have
been
awake
long
before
their
mistress
and
saw
fourteen
blue
eyes
looking
at
her
besides
two
roguish
black
ones
behind
the
curtain
which
she
did
not
see
and
would
wonder
if
it
might
not
have
been
the
kittens
after
all
that
had
whispered
in
her
ear
as
she
thought
of
all
his
kindness
to
her
she
was
silent
and
as
the
negro
drew
the
mantle
more
closely
about
her
he
wondered
if
the
little
drop
which
fell
upon
his
hand
was
of
dew
preparations
for
the
sailing
of
the
tantalizer
were
rapidly
going
on
she
was
a
ship
of
three
hundred
tons
burthen
the
pride
of
her
owners
and
why
should
she
not
have
been
for
many
a
rich
cargo
had
she
brought
to
them
thousands
and
thousands
of
dollars
had
she
added
to
their
possessions
many
a
hurricane
had
she
outrode
and
as
she
sat
so
proudly
on
the
water
she
looked
as
if
she
might
outlive
many
more
captain
grosvenor
had
sailed
master
of
her
upon
six
successive
voyages
making
a
telling
voyage
each
time
until
his
fortune
becoming
sufficiently
ample
he
had
thought
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
on
shore
but
after
a
respite
of
seven
years
he
had
become
so
restless
and
so
longed
to
try
his
fortune
upon
the
water
again
that
receiving
a
flattering
offer
from
those
in
whose
employ
he
had
formerly
sailed
he
consented
as
he
said
for
the
last
time
to
make
a
voyage
in
his
favorite
tantalizer
grosvenor
had
earnestly
hoped
that
her
husband
would
follow
the
sea
no
more
knowing
that
their
means
were
sufficient
to
supply
all
their
wants
and
since
god
in
his
providence
had
consigned
this
little
one
to
their
care
she
had
congratulated
herself
that
there
was
one
more
tie
to
bind
her
husband
to
his
home
and
indeed
the
child
was
as
dear
to
him
as
if
she
had
been
his
own
flesh
and
blood
and
as
those
last
seven
years
upon
shore
stood
up
before
him
now
that
he
was
about
to
leave
all
that
was
dear
to
him
as
having
been
spent
more
in
keeping
with
god
laws
than
in
any
previous
part
of
his
life
he
felt
that
he
was
a
better
man
naturally
of
a
noble
generous
disposition
he
had
gained
the
respect
of
all
who
knew
him
pleasant
and
gentlemanly
in
his
manners
he
was
no
less
firm
in
his
duties
on
shipboard
and
his
stern
word
of
command
was
received
by
his
men
with
the
same
hearty
aye
aye
as
when
he
cracked
a
joke
with
them
over
the
fire
harry
had
kept
his
promise
in
regard
to
his
wish
to
go
with
his
father
and
when
he
looked
into
his
mother
face
and
saw
how
mournful
was
her
smile
he
felt
that
it
would
indeed
be
cruel
to
think
of
leaving
her
but
when
he
heard
the
sailors
saying
as
he
clambered
up
the
rigging
that
it
was
a
pity
such
a
sprightly
little
fellow
could
not
go
along
with
them
his
desire
to
ship
for
the
voyage
knew
no
bounds
and
seeking
his
father
in
the
cabin
he
had
a
long
interview
with
him
gaining
the
promise
that
when
he
should
return
he
would
secure
for
him
a
good
lay
and
that
he
might
then
commence
the
nautical
career
which
the
captain
plainly
saw
his
inclinations
had
marked
out
the
day
had
arrived
when
the
ship
would
sail
every
thing
had
been
made
ready
for
a
long
voyage
should
the
captain
not
meet
with
his
usual
good
fortune
which
was
considered
unnecessary
by
her
owners
so
sanguine
were
they
of
her
success
such
implicit
faith
did
they
place
in
the
abilities
of
her
captain
that
in
securing
his
services
they
looked
upon
the
voyage
as
told
ah
who
can
tell
if
that
proud
ship
may
ever
return
was
there
not
one
who
looked
upon
her
thus
within
that
happy
home
now
so
desolate
sat
the
wife
of
him
who
had
just
taken
his
leave
of
her
and
the
bitterness
of
that
hour
who
can
tell
she
only
who
has
tasted
the
same
cup
of
sorrow
she
who
has
given
to
the
mercies
of
the
deep
him
whom
she
holds
most
dear
on
earth
such
an
one
can
indeed
realize
what
were
the
feelings
of
that
wife
as
she
sat
at
the
window
her
eye
fixed
upon
the
ship
which
was
bearing
away
him
whom
she
might
never
see
more
the
white
sail
is
smaller
and
smaller
until
it
appears
but
a
speck
and
is
finally
lost
in
the
distance
and
then
what
a
sense
of
desolation
oh
might
we
all
seek
for
strength
in
time
of
trouble
of
him
who
will
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
cries
of
his
children
who
hath
said
as
thy
day
so
shall
thy
strength
be
would
that
all
might
seek
for
comfort
in
the
hour
of
trial
as
did
that
stricken
one
in
prayer
the
had
with
harry
accompanied
her
father
in
the
ship
as
she
was
towed
out
by
the
steamer
over
the
bar
as
they
were
about
to
cast
off
when
the
steamer
should
return
the
father
sought
to
bid
his
children
farewell
turning
to
his
boy
he
bade
him
be
all
that
a
son
and
brother
should
be
with
one
long
embrace
his
eye
rested
upon
the
his
voice
failed
him
father
said
the
child
you
will
soon
come
to
us
again
then
you
will
never
leave
us
pointing
to
a
little
cross
which
she
had
privately
embroidered
and
set
up
in
his
she
said
you
will
be
happy
father
so
happy
on
the
water
but
sometimes
when
the
stars
look
down
upon
you
or
the
great
waves
break
over
your
ship
you
will
want
to
see
us
and
when
you
look
at
the
pretty
name
which
you
gave
me
pointing
out
the
word
natalie
which
was
wrought
upon
the
foot
of
the
cross
you
may
know
that
i
am
thinking
of
you
our
hearts
shall
be
with
you
with
a
father
blessing
upon
his
children
he
suffered
them
to
be
taken
away
and
as
the
loud
huzza
went
up
from
the
deck
of
the
steamer
he
saw
his
little
one
gazing
back
upon
him
from
amidst
the
waving
banners
with
a
look
which
sank
into
his
heart
her
gentle
words
were
still
sounding
in
his
ear
and
it
would
seem
as
if
that
voice
of
childhood
was
of
riper
years
her
words
were
never
forgotten
over
the
spirit
of
the
child
there
came
that
which
she
had
never
known
before
ah
gentle
one
it
is
but
the
first
drop
of
bitterness
which
must
be
mingled
with
the
sweets
in
every
life
may
the
keep
thy
feet
from
hidden
thorns
strewing
thy
pathway
only
with
the
sweet
flowers
of
innocence
he
had
gone
and
the
heart
of
the
echoed
he
has
gone
the
very
breeze
which
wafted
him
from
home
sighed
gone
is
there
a
heart
which
never
knew
the
tone

the

stout
oxen
with
as
many
horses
and

yes
sir
i

afther
urging

the

have

so
far
they
do

if

a

there
santon
had
formerly
been
a
merchant
in
the
city
of
boston
he
had
been
doing
a
heavy
business
and
had
accumulated
a
handsome
fortune
but
being
one
of
those
easy
sort
of
persons
who
think
everybody
as
honest
as
themselves
he
had
in
an
evil
hour
endorsed
largely
for
those
who
were
worse
than
swindlers
who
had
not
even
as
much
as
thanked
him
for
his
name
and
he
had
lost
nearly
all
in
that
one
act
many
friends
he
had
who
knowing
his
worth
had
kindly
offered
their
assistance
and
would
willingly
have
set
him
on
his
feet
again
for
they
disliked
to
lose
so
valuable
a
citizen
from
their
midst
but
he
declining
all
assistance
from
those
whom
he
knew
gave
not
grudgingly
thanked
them
with
a
grateful
heart
and
taking
what
little
was
left
to
him
after
paying
his
debts
had
started
with
his
wife
and
only
child
and
two
servants
whom
he
had
retained
for
the
far
west
intent
upon
leading
a
quiet
unmolested
life
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
haying
supplied
himself
with
all
requisite
tools
for
tilling
the
ground
for
which
occupation
he
had
always
a
great
desire
they
had
now
after
a
fatiguing
journey
of
fourteen
days
arrived
at
the
little
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
of
ohio
which
was
to
be
their
future
home
this
was
a
great
change
for
santon
who
had
spent
the
most
of
her
days
in
the
city
and
had
always
servants
to
call
upon
for
her
least
wish
never
being
obliged
to
lift
a
finger
against
her
desire
she
was
one
of
the
best
of
women
with
a
kind
word
for
every
one
and
greatly
did
the
poor
upon
whom
she
had
bestowed
so
many
gifts
of
charity
lament
her
departure
in
the
church
the
by
the
bedside
of
the
suffering
and
in
the
home
of
poverty
had
she
a
place
her
worth
was
known
to
all
cheerfully
did
she
resign
all
to
go
with
her
husband
to
follow
him
wherever
it
might
be
with
him
would
she
be
happy
in
their
home
though
it
might
be
ever
so
humble
their
daughter
of
ten
years
was
a
sprightly
pretty
child
with
dark
hair
and
bright
black
eyes
which
looked
as
if
they
might
make
sad
havoc
when
a
few
more
years
should
have
added
to
their
brilliancy
resembling
her
mother
in
features
her
disposition
was
like
her
father
free
and
easy
in
her
ways
she
was
happy
so
long
as
every
thing
bent
to
her
wishes
but
her
mother
could
not
but
notice
with
regret
that
her
child
had
acquired
a
hasty
impatient
manner
which
the
indulgence
of
her
father
in
no
way
served
to
improve
yet
she
was
a
little
creature
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
santon
could
bring
herself
to
censure
her
still
the
mother
must
do
her
duty
toward
her
child
and
many
a
prayer
had
been
offered
that
she
might
have
strength
to
act
aright
the
long
covered
wagon
stopped
at
the
door
of
their
new
home
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
there
was
but
one
house
in
sight
of
their
little
cabin
and
that
was
if
anything
still
smaller
than
their
own
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
all
sides
but
wide
prairie
land
and
as
the
little
winifred
cast
her
eye
around
she
exclaimed
o
mother
what
shall
we
do
here
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
like
to
stay
there
is
no
one
here
you
forget
that
god
is
here
my
child
said
the
mother
and
she
commenced
assisting
biddy
in
setting
up
some
few
articles
that
would
make
them
comfortable
through
the
night
while
her
husband
with
pat
attended
to
the
affairs
och
and
sure
mem
said
biddy
as
she
put
her
emerald
head
in
at
the
door
of
the
cabin
faith
and
it
not
yesilf
mem
that
going
to
rest
in
the
same
room
with
the
likes
of
me
yes
biddy
i
see
no
other
way
we
shall
have
to
get
used
to
western
life
i
think
by
partitioning
off
one
corner
here
with
blankets
we
shall
get
along
very
well
and
then
it
will
be
right
handy
for
you
in
the
morning
to
get
the
breakfast
you
will
not
have
the
trouble
of
coming
down
stairs
yes
mem
yese
makes
everything
so
asy
like
but
it
such
strange
times
for
yese
mem
and
biddy
went
flying
about
the
room
her
face
glowing
with
excitement
pulling
at
every
uneven
log
in
the
house
fully
persuaded
there
must
be
some
other
apartment
if
no
more
than
a
closet
and
as
she
caught
at
a
loose
board
which
only
separated
them
from
the
open
air
she
looked
through
delighted
that
she
had
discovered
another
room
and
that
her
mistress
would
not
now
be
obliged
to
share
the
same
apartment
with
herself
for
as
the
remembrance
of
certain
devotional
exercises
to
be
gone
through
over
each
bead
in
her
rosary
came
to
her
she
had
her
doubts
if
the
blissed
pathrick
who
for
reasons
best
known
to
herself
was
her
favorite
saint
would
condescend
to
listen
to
petitions
offered
from
such
near
proximity
to
the
unbelieving
protestants
not
that
she
thought
her
mistress
was
not
a
most
excellent
woman
but
she
was
a
protestant
and
often
had
she
called
upon
the
blissid
patrick
to
bring
her
dear
lady
over
to
the
thrue
faith
as
she
bent
down
to
look
into
the
opening
congratulating
herself
upon
the
discovery
a
large
cat
darted
through
full
into
her
face
and
ran
with
speed
out
at
the
door
och
murther
and
may
the
good
saints
presarve
us
alive
what
will
become
of
us
at
all
and
in
her
fright
she
went
headlong
into
a
pile
of
her
unwieldy
arms
making
certain
involuntary
revolutions
causing
the
air
to
resound
with
a
chorus
which
might
have
done
credit
to
the
first
callithumpian
in
the
land
ho
what
is
all
this
cried
santon
who
had
stepped
in
at
the
commencement
of
the
prelude
what
are
you
looking
for
under
those
pans
biddy
sure
sir
and
it
mesilf
that
afther
being
exterpretated
intirely
the
varmints
faith
there
was
a
dozen
sir
came
scratching
at
me
and
she
pointed
at
the
aperture
as
if
in
dread
expectation
of
seeing
their
ghosts
in
pursuit
but
lo
instead
there
was
the
full
round
face
of
pat
who
having
been
left
to
take
up
his
night
lodging
with
the
creatures
in
the
apology
for
a
barn
had
espied
the
light
and
not
being
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
getting
one
more
glimpse
at
the
swate
biddy
he
had
ventured
to
look
in
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
woebegone
face
from
among
the
shining
tins
he
exclaimed
och
honey
dear
and
has
it
come
to
this
that
yese
obliged
to
make
yese
bed
of
the
likes
of
that
and

bit

and

of
the
nate
saft
sthraw
that

the
tins
and

and
it
none
but
a
hathen
that

endure
the
likes
of
that
ah
pathrick

ye
and
was
ye
pint
up
in
there
wid
the
crathurs
yes
it
mesilf
that
will
be
risting
with
the
bastes
the
night
said
pat
thinking
she
had
alluded
to
the
creatures
in
the
barn
and
i
be
wishing
ye
swate
dhrames
and
a
plinty
of
thim
saying
which
he
disappeared
leaving
the
trembling
biddy
in
great
anxiety
of
mind
as
to
what
should
be
his
fate
as
the
little
winnie
peeped
out
from
behind
the
screen
when
they
had
all
retired
and
saw
biddy
counting
her
beads
with
her
eye
still
fixed
upon
the
spot
where
she
had
last
seen
the
smiling
patrick
she
laughed
outright
in
spite
of
the
crevices
in
the
roof
overhead
and
she
laid
her
down
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
which
came
twinkling
in
upon
her
those
great
black
eyes
gradually
diminished
in
size
and
her
little
brain
was
busily
engaged
among
the
familiar
scenes
of
the
home
which
she
had
left
so
far
away
cautiously
did
biddy
with
the
first
dawn
of
day
advance
toward
where
she
had
dreamed
her
poor
pathrick
was
in
close
contact
with
the
veritable
bastes
and
the
family
was
awakened
from
their
slumbers
by
her
loud
tones
lamenting
that
niver
a
vistage
of
pathrick
the
cats
or
the
was
left
for
on
looking
out
the
only
object
which
met
her
gaze
was
the
sun
which
was
just
coming
up
in
the
east
what
the
time
biddy
asked
santon
and
it
jist
about
three
hours
afther
sunrise
mem
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
biddy
we
can
not
surely
have
been
sleeping
so
long
after
our
usual
time
for
rising
indade
and
the
sun
bes
jist
coming
in
sight
and
it
must
have
been
a
powerful
time
travelling
over
sure
i
thinking
they
must
be
afther
dhrying
their
takettles
a
long
time
back
there
in
ould
boston
time
passed
on
and
our
adventurers
were
becoming
more
and
more
accustomed
to
western
life
santon
had
found
his
lands
to
be
in
a
very
good
state
of
cultivation

former
owner
having
been
a
dutchman
who
thoroughly
understood
what
a
good
farm
ought
to
be
santon
had
proved
herself
to
be
one
of
the
best
of
housekeepers
and
greatly
did
she
pride
herself
on
her
abilities
for
filling
the
station
of
a
wife
as
they
sat
down
of
an
evening
to
their
meal
of
bacon
and
indian
cakes
and
contrasted
their
present
circumstances
with
what
had
been
their
former
situation
in
life
they
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
the
change
but
they
were
happy
contented
in
their
humble
home
and
the
bread
which
had
been
earned
by
the
sweat
of
the
brow
was
sweeter
the
social
enjoyments
dearer
than
when
in
fashionable
life
they
had
been
obliged
to
live
with
an
eye
to
the
customs
of
society
even
winnie
had
found
some
attractions
in
their
little
western
home
the
neighbors
comprising
those
who
lived
for
twenty
miles
around
the
nearest
being
a
mile
distant
were
pleasant
people
and
the
civilities
which
were
shown
to
the
new
comers
were
without
end
a
small
unlike
the
others
of
the
settlement
in
its
exterior
inasmuch
as
it
was
honored
with
an
additional
door
served
as
their
place
of
worship
and
it
was
with
great
joy
that
winnie
looked
forward
to
sunday
morning
when
mounted
upon
her
pony
she
might
ride
off
for
six
miles
to
the
church
accompanied
by
her
father
and
mother
each
riding
their
respective
horses
arrived
at
the
church
they
dismounted
at
the
great
horseblock
leaving
their
hats
and
mantles
thereon
as
was
the
custom
and
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
ladies
walking
into
church
their
cheeks
glowing
with
exercise
and
the
fresh
morning
air
as
winnie
entered
her
long
curls
composing
themselves
after
a
frolic
with
the
breeze
many
a
sly
glance
was
aimed
at
her
from
the
neighboring
pews
in
spite
of
the
consciences
of
their
owners
reminding
them
that
it
was
holy
day
it
was
a
source
of
great
comfort
to
santon
that
she
as
able
to
come
so
far
to
this
place
of
worship
the
little
society
numbered
not
over
forty
persons
yet
those
words
spoken
by
our
saviour
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
will
i
be
in
the
midst
of
them
came
with
renewed
freshness
to
her
mind
each
time
she
entered
those
doors
and
she
felt
that
she
had
never
tasted
the
bliss
of
uninterrupted
love
for
christ
as
now
the
shepherd
of
this
little
flock
was
a
man
fearing
god
just
and
upright
his
services
in
the
cause
of
christ
were
offered
voluntarily
without
money
or
price
coming
as
he
had
in
his
old
age
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
the
family
of
a
beloved
son
he
had
found
with
joy
that
his
declining
years
might
be
profitably
employed
that
he
might
earn
that
reward
which
is
promised
to
those
who
make
a
right
use
of
the
talents
which
god
has
given
them
that
he
might
merit
those
blessed
words
well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
his
labors
among
this
people
had
not
proved
ineffectual
many
had
been
brought
to
see
the
great
mercies
of
their
redeemer
souls
had
been
converted
to
christ
and
as
the
song
of
praise
went
up
from
beneath
that
humble
roof
the
glad
shouts
were
borne
aloft
and
angels
joined
in
the
chorus
it
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
everybody
was
busy
about
the
farm
of
santon
winnie
was
sitting
at
the
door
intent
upon
her
own
thoughts
when
she
caught
sight
of
their
good
minister
approaching
upon
his
horse
his
silver
locks
flying
in
the
wind
biddy
learning
they
were
to
have
a
visit
from
the
protestant
praste
turned
first
pale
then
red
and
when
the
old
gentleman
dismounted
at
the
door
she
let
fall
the
shoulder
of
bacon
which
she
was
preparing
for
the
supper
and
darted
behind
the
screen
in
her
haste
hitting
her
foot
against
the
lowest
tin
in
a
pile
of
two
dozen
which
brought
the
rest
down
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
affairs
the
presence
of
the
old
gentleman
served
to
impart
a
cheerfulness
to
all
who
gazed
upon
his
happy
countenance
and
his
kind
tones
as
he
inquired
for
the
welfare
of
the
family
penetrated
the
screen
reaching
the
ear
of
biddy
who
sat
wondering
what
the
good
father
teely
would
say
if
he
knew
she
had
so
far
sinned
as
to
remain
under
the
same
roof
with
a
wicked
protestant
praste
but
as
she
heard
him
speaking
to
pat
who
had
come
in
of
an
errand
with
such
a
pleasant
voice
she
ventured
a
peep
out
and
the
form
of
her
thoughts
just
at
that
moment
might
have
been
a
little
a
very
little
savoring
of
heresy
suffice
it
to
say
when
the
old
gentleman
took
his
departure
there
was
a
peculiar
twinkle
in
biddy
eye
and
she
had
so
far
overcome
her
aversion
to
the
imposther
as
to
have
had
a
few
private
words
with
him
which
had
by
no
means
decreased
her
usual
flow
of
good
spirits
it
was
evident
that
biddy
had
on
her
high
heels
for
the
rest
of
that
evening
as
winnie
strolled
over
the
farm
enjoying
the
evening
breeze
reflecting
upon
her
good
pastor
words
her
attention
was
suddenly
attracted
toward
the
enclosure
where
the
cows
were
being
milked
by
hearing
the
voice
of
biddy
who
as
she
stripped
the
patient
animal
again
for
the
dozenth
time
was
very
much
engaged
with
pat
whose
round
smiling
face
as
he
glanced
at
her
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
creature
shone
with
delight
and
as
the
white
foam
rose
higher
and
higher
in
biddy
pail
so
did
the
warmth
of
her
feelings
get
the
better
of
her
and
those
eyes
of
winnie
danced
with
mischief
as
she
overheard
the
following
conversation
ah
pathrick
dear
does
ye
think
there
is
the
laste
sin
in
it
and
indade
it
mesilf

the
assenting
pat
and
together
they
walked
towards
the
cabin
winnie
putting
that
and
that
together
made
up
her
mind
that
patrick
and
biddy
had
become
tired
of
a
life
of
single
blessedness
and
were
seriously
contemplating
matrimony
which
was
indeed
the
case
and
biddy
having
made
known
her
desires
to
her
mistress
who
saw
no
just
cause
why
they
should
not
be
bound
together
in
the
holy
bands
of
wedlock
the
next
wednesday
was
set
apart
when
patrick
and
biddy
would
be
made
husband
and
wife
the
day
arrived
and
biddy
arrayed
in
her
best
with
ribbons
and
laces
to
match
stood
up
with
him
of
her
choice
to
pronounce
those
vows
which
should
make
them
one
even
though
the
ceremony
should
be
performed
by
a
protestant
will
you
take
this
woman
to
be
your
wedded
wife
spake
the
reverend
gentleman
in
a
clear
distinct
tone
ah

the
enraptured
pat
do

throublin
yesilf
with
questions
dear
knows
it
mesilf
that
in
it
and
his
smiling
face
was
mirrored
in
numerous
brass
buttons
which
were
hanging
around
his
buff
vest
as
soon
as
the
old
gentleman
could
get
his
voice
again
for
the
boisterous
joy
of
pat
be
turned
to
the
trembling
biddy
do

take
this
man
to
be

always
born
and
reared
in
the
great
city
of
cork
that
be
doing
things
by
halves
and
in
her
happiness
she
caught
pat
around
the
neck
giving
him
a
smack
which
might
have
been
attributed
to
the
opening
of
the
bottle
of
whiskey
with
which
santon
had
graced
the
occasion
had
it
not
been
for
those
great
eyes
of
winnie
which
would
discover
the
accident
in
spite
of
their
mistress
endeavors
to
direct
their
attention
elsewhere
and
now
patrick
and
biddy
were
husband
and
wife
never
was
there
a
more
devoted
couple
the
days
glided
pleasantly
on
biddy
keeping
time
in
her
endeavors
to
please
her
mistress
with
the
joys
of
her
heart
everything
went
on
cheerfully
not
a
note
of
discontent
was
heard
except
that
the
little
winnie
would
sometimes
break
into
sighing
for
the
pleasures
of
her
early
home
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
the
quietude
of
this
home
in
the
west
until
early
in
the
ensuing
fall
when
santon
was
taken
with
a
violent
attack
of
western
fever
which
threatening
to
undermine
her
health
santon
was
fearful
lest
they
should
be
obliged
to
return
east
but
the
fever
leaving
her
she
was
again
able
to
attend
to
her
duties
with
only
an
occasional
shake
and
the
discussion
as
to
their
return
was
for
the
present
discontinued

of
life
shakespeare
romeo
and
juliet
as
the
dews
of

fall
gently
lulling
the
flowers
to
rest
so
did
the
low
clear
voice
of
the
soothe
the
weary
spirits
of
grosvenor
as
she
read
from
the
evening
paper
the
following
paragraph
spoken
by

barrels
of

sail
for

in
a
few
days
all
well
hurrah
for
father
exclaimed
harry
he
will
be
at
home
in
less
than
two
years
at
that
rate
and
then
he
promised
me
that
i
should
see
what
old
ocean
is
made
of
my
son
you
will
learn
full
soon
what
a
life
at
sea
is
your
bright
visions
may
indeed
some
of
them
be
realized
the
many
dangers
to
which
you
will
be
exposed
will
not
serve
to
mar
your
joys
for
to
such
a
heart
as
yours
they
will
pass
unheeded
but
for
all
that
my
son
you
will
meet
with
many
hardships
of
which
you
little
know
i
would
wish
you
never
to
follow
the
sea
my
boy
but
if
you
are
still
determined
upon
it
when
your
father
returns
i
shall
have
to
give
my
consent
though
with
reluctance
you
will
then
be
old
enough
to
choose
your
own
pursuits
for
life
and
whatever
they
may
be
remember
harry
to
lead
an
honest
upright
life
never
losing
sight
of
your
early
instructions
and
the
prayers
of
your
mother
as
grosvenor
ceased
speaking
she
looked
upon
her
son
and
could
hardly
realize
that
her
little
harry
who
had
loved
to
lay
his
head
upon
her
bosom
and
listen
while
she
told
him
of
his
father
who
had
gone
away
over
the
blue
water
to
get
such
pretty
things
for
his
boy
had
grown
to
be
a
tall
lad
of
fifteen
years
and
well
might
she
have
been
proud
of
her
son
for
the
nobleness
of
his
soul
was
apparent
in
every
feature
as
vingo
expressed
himself
young
massa
harry
am
got
up
ob
what
neber
would
get
used
to
de
atmosphere
ob
old
berginny
mother
said
harry
i
shall
never
forget
your
teachings
i
shall
always
hold
them
sacred
in
my
heart
and
wherever
i
go
in
whatever
circumstances
i
am
placed
i
will
be
true
to
you
my
mother
and
he
pressed
a
fervent
kiss
upon
the
brow
of
her
who
was
worthy
the
name
as
grosvenor
returned
her
son
embrace
she
felt
that
perhaps
she
had
said
too
much
that
she
had
been
selfish
in
wishing
to
have
him
always
near
her
and
she
observed
that
he
wore
an
expression
of
pain
of
deep
emotion
which
he
in
vain
attempted
to
conceal
the
had
rested
her
head
upon
her
hand
and
while
her
mother
had
been
engaged
with
harry
a
silent
spectator
might
have
wondered
to
what
unseen
object
those
deep
oases
of
love
were
imparting
their
purity
the
words
of
harry
had
fallen
upon
her
ear
i
shall
see
what
old
ocean
is
made
of
shall
we
follow
in
the
train
of
her
musings
they
will
lead
us
not
where
the
fallen
tread
on
the
banks
of
the
still
waters
of
peace
the
willows
whose
tears
are
of
innocence
frisk
the
tender
lambs
who
taste
only
of
the
sweets
of
the
green
pasture
i
shall
see
what
old
ocean
is
made
of
far
away
in
coral
dells
where
the
nymphs
of
ocean
tune
their
harps
in
praise
to
nature
god
the
loves
to
ramble
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
in
time
long
past
and
the
mysteries
of
ocean
were
that
childhood
home
ah
loved
one
thou
dost
not
pause
to
find
what
is
which
makes
thy
heart
to
beat
in
unison
with
the
murmuring
of
the
waters
perchance
those
restless
billows
are
but
the
echoings
of
thy
soul
desire
to
breathe
that
upper
air
and
breathing
gasp
for
more
is
not
for
us
to
tell
thee
that
bright
ones
came
down
and
bore
the
spirit
of
her
who
gave
thee
life
to
that
better
land
from
hence
nor
of
the
dying
prayer
lord
keep
my
child
which
was
caught
up
by
each
listening
billow
and
the
supplication
since
renewed
by
the
voices
of
the
deep
why
grosvenor
had
spoken
thus
upon
this
evening
to
her
son
she
could
not
tell
she
felt
there
was
some
irresistible
power
which
bade
her
speak
that
charge
never
lose
sight
of
your
early
instructions
and
the
prayers
of
your
mother
as
she
retired
early
for
the
night
feeling
slightly
indisposed
she
met
the
gaze
of
harry
which
was
fixed
upon
her
attributing
its
uncommon
earnestness
to
a
determination
on
his
part
to
cherish
her
words
and
he
never
did
forget
them
but
ah
fond
mother
sleep
on
take
thy
rest
and
gain
strength
for
the
rising
for
thou
knowest
not
of
the
cup
of
sorrow
which
is
being
prepared
for
thee
as
harry
sat
watching
the
bright
flames
as
they
went
crackling
up
the
chimney
his
sister
came
and
rested
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
where
they
remained
until
reminding
him
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
was
about
to
retire
when
her
brother
threw
his
arm
about
her
begging
her
to
remain
a
little
for
said
he
i
shall
not
always
have
my
dear
sister
to
comfort
me
to
comfort
you
harry
do
you
who
are
always
so
and
joyous
need
comforting
ah
pussy
but
you
can
make
the
happiest
heart
happier
i
was
thinking
of
mother
it
is
a
comfort
to
me
that
she
has
you
to
cheer
her
lonely
hours
i
think
mother
is
less
sad
than
she
has
been
for
now
she
is
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
father
shall
come
home
and
i
think
she
flatters
herself
that
she
can
dissuade
you
from
going
to
sea
and
then
we
shall
be
an
unbroken
happy
family
once
more
those
words
why
had
they
power
to
make
that
boy
turn
pale
had
he
not
been
screened
from
the
bright
glow
of
the
the
must
have
noticed
his
agitation
as
she
looked
up
for
the
kiss
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
and
then
the
door
closed
upon
her
gentle
form
the
old
clock
in
the
church
tower
had
struck
eleven
and
harry
heard
the
cry
of
the
watch
all
well
he
still
stood
where
he
had
parted
with
his
sister
as
her
last
footfall
upon
the
stairs
died
away
and
the
house
was
hushed
for
the
night
the
plans
which
he
had
matured
long
days
ago
for
this
night
execution
laid
fast
hold
of
him
can
it
be
possible
that
the
boy
is
about
to
forget
those
last
words
of
his
mother
no
they
are
still
sounding
in
his
ear
and
his
promise
i
will
not
forget
the
prayers
of
my
mother
but
does
he
consider
in
the
step
which
he
is
about
to
take
of
the
arrow
which
will
pierce
that
heart
he
walks
the
room
with
a
quick
tread
he
does
reflect
and
pities
his
mother
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
praying
that
the
blow
may
fall
gently
but
he
has
shipped
for
a
voyage
in
the
nautilus
and
this
night
at
high
tide
she
will
sail
noiselessly
he
ascends
to
his
room
and
taking
his
clothes
from
the
drawer
where
they
had
been
placed
with
care
makes
them
into
a
bundle
not
forgetting
the
little
bible
which
was
given
him
by
his
mother
only
the
day
before
as
a
birthday
gift
pausing
in
the
upper
hall
he
listens
if
he
may
get
one
last
faint
sound
from
those
he
holds
so
dear
but
save
the
uneasy
slumbers
of
vingo
nothing
is
heard
all
is
now
ready
for
his
departure
stepping
into
the
parlors
where
hang
the
portraits
of
the
family
he
takes
a
farewell
of
each
the
and
his
mother
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
and
his
heart
is
swelling
into
his
throat
he
is
upon
the
point
of
retracing
his
steps
when
his
eye
rests
upon
the
features
of
his
father
the
daring
boldness
of
the
expression
which
the
artist
had
but
too
well
portrayed
fires
him
with
fresh
courage
every
nerve
thrills
with
new
life
and
kissing
the
inanimate
canvas
as
if
it
were
indeed
his
dear
mother
and
sister
he
tore
himself
away
from
home
walking
rapidly
down
the
deserted
street
without
venturing
a
look
back
he
passes
many
an
endeared
object
the
old
white
church
where
he
has
been
accustomed
to
worship
sunday
after
sunday
for
many
years
holds
high
its
head
in
the
bright
moonlight
and
the
hands
of
the
old
town
clock
upon
the
tower
seem
to
beckon
him
to
return
he
falters
it
would
seem
as
if
the
very
doors
of
the
church
would
open
and
receive
him
throwing
down
the
bundle
he
kneels
upon
the
and
breathes
a
prayer
to
heaven
to
bless
those
who
will
enter
therein
when
he
shall
be
gone
pressing
his
lips
to
the
cold
stone
where
have
trod
he
rises
when
lo
standing
by
his
side
with
the
package
of
clothes
in
his
mouth
is
the
old
house
dog
nep
and
as
the
watch
in
the
tower
cries
past
eleven
and
all
is
well
he
looks
wistfully
into
his
master
face
as
if
he
would
ask
is
all
well
what
is
to
be
done
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
ship
will
be
towed
out
into
the
stream
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
but
the
dog
will
not
think
of
leaving
his
master
for
his
experience
of
years
tells
him
it
is
a
new
thing
for
the
boy
to
be
wandering
from
home
at
this
unseasonable
hour
in
vain
did
harry
attempt
to
drive
the
faithful
creature
from
him
for
never
having
been
an
unwelcome
companion
before
the
dog
did
not
understand
his
master
threatening
gestures
yet
he
could
understand
that
something
was
amiss
and
for
that
reason
kept
close
upon
his
master
heels
to
shield
him
from
all
danger
arriving
at
the
wharf
the
boy
once
more
attempted
to
drive
the
dog
from
him
when
looking
around
he
espied
a
bit
of
rope
with
which
he
made
him
fast
to
a
post
and
then
clambered
up
the
ship
side
poor
nep
keeping
his
eye
upon
his
master
laid
him
quietly
down
until
the
lines
were
cast
off
and
the
ship
began
to
recede
from
the
shore
o
harry
could
you
leave
the
companion
of
your
infancy
thus
made
fast
to
a
yard
rope
to
shiver
in
the
night
air
it
was
his
only
alternative
for
in
taking
neptune
with
him
he
well
knew
would
be
robbing
the
household
of
one
more
endearment
no
sooner
had
the
ship
started
from
her
moorings
and
nep
saw
that
his
master
was
being
borne
away
than
he
gave
a
piteous
howl
and
with
one
bound
parted
the
line
which
held
him
and
plunging
into
the
tide
made
vigorous
attempts
to
reach
the
ship
breakers
on
the
larboard
bow
sung
out
the
captain
who
stood
laughing
to
see
the
labors
of
the
poor
animal
who
was
becoming
exhausted
see
who
have
the
first
harpoon
and
he
hurled
a
billet
at
the
head
as
he
was
going
down
for
the
second
time
harry
seeing
the
action
cried
out
save
him
who
will
save
my
poor
nep
and
fell
fainting
upon
the
deck
fortunately
the
man
had
missed
his
mark
for
once
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
poor
fellow
was
seen
just
under
the
bows
struggling
feebly
as
if
about
to
give
up
when
an
old
tar
who
had
heard
harry
cry
for
help
sprang
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
and
seizing
a
rope
made
it
into
a
throwing
it
over
the
head
nearly
strangling
him
as
he
drew
him
out
of
the
water
together
they
lay
motionless
upon
the
deck
harry
and
nep
when
the
captain
coming
along
would
have
stumbled
over
them
had
he
not
caught
at
a
halliard
near
by
what
in
the
name
of
things
unheard
of
is
all
this
exclaimed
he
with
an
oath
this
indeed
is
a
curious
beginning
for
the
little
i
the
greatest
mind
to
set
him
ashore
to
come
to
his
senses
at
his
leisure
and
if
i
not
greatly
mistaken
he
but
a
young
runaway
at
best
but
we
might
as
well
keep
him
now
he
do
for
testing
the
strength
of
our
cats
and
as
for
that
other
critter
sampson
you
may
hand
him
over
to
the
steward
and
tell
him
i
shall
want
a
nice
when
we
get
out
where
the
ice
makes
an
inch
a
minute
sampson
who
had
shipped
as
the
same
that
had
rescued
old
nep
from
drowning
lifted
harry
in
his
arms
and
carrying
him
below
laid
him
in
his
own
hammock
where
he
also
brought
the
dog
who
was
apparently
lifeless
and
laid
him
by
his
side
it
was
a
long
time
before
harry
was
restored
to
consciousness
and
when
he
had
gained
strength
sufficient
to
raise
himself
upon
one
arm
he
looked
around
in
the
darkness
perfectly
bewildered
but
as
the
remembrance
of
his
situation
slowly
came
to
him
he
called
aloud
in
agony
of
spirit
nep
poor
drowned
neptune
tossing
upon
his
hammock
his
arm
came
in
contact
with
the
creature
shaggy
coat
could
it
be
nep
rescued
from
the
inhuman
treatment
of
the
captain
but
he
did
not
move
was
he
alive
harry
sprang
from
his
bed
and
making
his
way
in
the
darkness
he
knew
not
whither
finally
found
himself
in
the
captain
which
was
unoccupied
and
seizing
a
candle
reached
his
hammock
just
as
sampson
returned
man
alive
where
did
you
get
that
light
asked
sampson
apparently
much
terrified
o
sir
i
took
the
first
one
i
could
find
for
i
must
see
if
my
poor
neptune
is
dead
and
he
bent
over
him
smoothing
his
head
calling
loudly
neptune
poor
neptune
sampson
recognizing
the
silver
candlestick
as
belonging
in
the
captain
hastened
to
return
it
knowing
well
what
the
consequences
would
be
if
that
dignitary
discovered
that
any
one
had
dared
to
enter
his
room
without
orders
and
giving
harry
a
few
friendly
hints
as
to
what
his
liberties
would
be
under
their
commander
he
drew
out
a
mysterious
looking
bottle
from
his
and
diluting
a
small
quantity
of
its
contents
gave
it
to
harry
to
drink
which
in
his
weak
condition
did
not
come
amiss
turning
to
the
dog
the
kind
old
tar
commenced
rubbing
him
vigorously
bathing
his
cold
limbs
with
the
spirit
glancing
occasionally
at
the
gangway
to
see
who
might
darken
the
descent
the
dog
at
last
gave
signs
of
life
and
to
harry
great
joy
he
looked
up
and
recognized
his
master
sampson
assuring
him
in
his
rough
way
that
the
old
fellow
would
soon
be
as
good
as
new
it
was
the
last
watch
in
the
morning
and
harry
hearing
loud
voices
on
deck
ventured
out
it
was
a
clear
cold
morning
the
moon
had
gone
down
and
venus
was
just
rising
in
the
east
on
every
side
was
the
blue
rolling
water
they
had
left
nantucket
miles
behind
sampson
who
was
on
duty
seeing
the
boy
looking
out
as
if
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
island
had
been
submerged
shook
out
a
reef
in
the
line
which
he
was
making
fast
that
he
might
catch
the
boy
ear
and
pointing
to
a
dim
light
far
down
in
the
distant
horizon
he
remarked
look
well
old
sankoty
i
thinking
you
have
seen
different
days
when
you
make
her
again
halloo
there
aft
called
out
the
captain
has
that
kitten
got
to
mewing
bear
a
hand
there
and
square
your
mizzen
topsail
added
he
a
tone
of
mockery
the
order
had
hardly
left
his
lips
when
harry
with
a
hearty
aye
aye
sir
sprang
into
the
and
in
a
twinkling
had
reached
the
masthead
calling
out
in
a
voice
which
brought
to
the
mind
of
each
old
tar
that
he
had
once
a
mother
square
away
it
is
sir
the
captain
could
scarce
believe
his
eyes
seeing
by
the
smile
upon
the
face
of
every
man
on
deck
that
he
had
been
decidedly
sold
he
hailed
him
again
ahoy
aye
aye
sir
take
your
bearings
from
the
fog
bank
to
your
leeward
and
tell
me
how
she
heads
the
boy
hesitated
he
saw
which
way
the
wind
blew
and
bethinking
himself
of
a
small
pocket
compass
which
he
had
about
him
sung
out
by
east
sir
two
points
off
the
man
at
the
wheel
responded
by
east
two
points
off
it
would
not
do
the
captain
saw
that
he
had
mistaken
his
man
and
called
all
hands
to
pipe
down
as
sampson
passed
him
he
doffed
his
tarpaulin
remarking
i
think
sir
the
youngster
will
do
very
well
for
trying
the
strength
of
our
cats
it
was
evident
to
harry
before
he
had
sailed
many
days
under
captain
jostler
that
he
had
one
of
the
most
tyrannical
of
masters
he
had
been
a
perfect
stranger
to
him
when
he
shipped
for
the
voyage
being
a
native
of
canada
and
from
the
frozen
condition
of
his
heart
no
one
would
have
doubted
it
had
he
been
a
nantucket
man
master
harry
would
have
found
it
more
difficult
in
getting
away
so
privately
as
it
was
no
inquiries
were
made
of
him
how
different
was
harry
situation
from
what
it
would
have
been
had
his
father
procured
for
him
a
berth
as
it
was
he
was
doomed
to
no
common
hardships
for
the
captain
having
taken
a
dislike
to
him
from
the
first
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
making
him
as
uncomfortable
as
possible
and
had
it
not
been
that
he
was
a
favorite
with
the
crew
he
would
have
suffered
many
times
from
exposure
many
a
cold
stormy
night
had
he
been
ordered
to
take
his
turn
in
the
watch
upon
deck
in
spite
of
the
petitions
of
the
men
to
fill
his
place
and
he
would
walk
the
deck
for
hours
to
keep
from
becoming
benumbed
with
the
cold
but
as
his
mother
had
predicted
the
hardships
and
dangers
to
which
he
was
exposed
did
not
serve
to
dampen
his
spirits
and
for
that
very
reason
did
the
captain
shower
upon
him
many
abuses
for
in
spite
of
his
cruel
treatment
toward
him
he
never
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
look
anything
but
cheerful
at
such
times
when
the
wind
was
howling
fiercely
and
the
salt
spray
came
dashing
over
the
deck
freezing
upon
the
cheek
of
the
youthful
mariner
but
never
penetrating
that
heart
which
was
warmed
by
the
remembrance
of
other
days
the
boy
would
think
of
home
of
his
mother
and
as
he
uttered
the
name
of
the
aloud
those
voices
of
the
sea
would
appear
as
if
the
wild
reëchoings
of
the
tone
and
the
low
moanings
of
the
wind
through
the
shrouds
were
of
pity
for
that
lone
one
on
the
deck
of
the
outward
bound
could
the
boy
have
had
old
nep
for
a
companion
in
his
midnight
watchings
he
would
have
served
to
while
away
the
time
but
that
pleasure
was
not
allowed
him
for
captain
jostler
had
threatened
to
throw
the
dog
overboard
if
he
came
in
contact
with
him
in
any
of
his
walks
consequently
harry
had
doomed
him
to
a
life
in
the
hold
seldom
venturing
to
visit
him
except
to
carry
the
food
which
he
had
saved
from
his
own
short
allowance
and
he
often
wondered
how
the
poor
fellow
could
keep
alive
on
such
short
rations
not
knowing
of
the
purloined
bits
which
were
bestowed
upon
him
from
sampson
commodious
there
she
blows
there
she
blows
hailed
the
from
the
as
a
school
of
whales
hove
in
sight
about
three
miles
astern
one
afternoon
when
they
had
been
four
months
on
the
whaling
grounds
it
was
the
first
discovery
that
had
been
made
they
having
been
thus
far
unsuccessful
all
hands
were
immediately
called
up
every
man
was
at
his
post
making
ready
for
the
coming
scene
of
action
not
as
a
in
the
charging
of
cannon
the
priming
of
musketry
and
the
brandishing
of
swords
a
battle
between
man
and
man
but
the
boats
were
lowered
the
harpoons
were
got
out
and
everything
was
made
ready
for
an
encounter
with
the
monster
of
the
ocean
now
was
the
time
when
the
captain
would
exhibit
his
skill
as
a
whaler
all
depends
on
his
management
as
to
their
success
he
must
be
cool
and
collected
working
systematically
for
not
only
does
it
require
great
skill
and
caution
in
the
capturing
of
the
whale
but
there
are
many
dangers
attendant
upon
the
encounter
there
she
blows
no
sooner
did
captain
jostler
hear
the
report
than
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
go
beside
himself
every
man
was
ready
to
do
his
duty
and
had
they
possessed
the
right
kind
of
commander
might
have
done
well
but
where
there
is
no
head
nothing
is
accomplished
everything
was
confusion
the
captain
springing
into
the
first
boat
bade
his
men
follow
leaving
beside
harry
but
two
worthless
fellows
who
hardly
knew
a
skysail
from
a
in
charge
of
the
ship
harry
kept
his
eye
upon
the
boats
for
hours
he
perceived
they
were
evidently
having
a
hard
time
of
it
running
aft
to
get
a
glass
as
they
distanced
him
he
discovered
a
fog
had
sprang
up
and
was
shutting
in
heavily
on
all
sides
he
returned
to
mark
the
boats
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
had
lost
them
entirely
nothing
was
to
be
seen
on
all
sides
but
thick
fog
banks
what
was
to
be
done
where
they
were
how
far
from
the
boats
and
in
what
direction
they
knew
not
the
boy
was
aware
that
they
were
all
ignorant
of
the
management
of
the
ship
and
what
was
worse
should
the
least
breeze
spring
up
they
would
be
borne
they
knew
not
whither
a
couple
of
hours
passed
and
the
fog
did
not
lift
night
was
coming
on
and
from
the
increased
darkness
together
with
a
low
rumbling
noise
of
the
sea
it
was
evident
a
storm
was
brewing
harry
anxiously
walked
the
quarter
deck
it
would
be
certain
destruction
if
they
remained
in
that
position
till
night
should
overtake
them
the
boy
called
to
the
men
asking
what
was
to
be
done
but
they
in
terror
could
do
nothing
but
lament
their
situation
calling
out
against
the
captain
for
leaving
them
in
such
a
state
harry
hesitated
what
was
done
must
be
done
speedily
to
take
in
sail
was
his
first
thought
then
with
the
assistance
of
the
clumsy
seamen
he
rolled
out
a
small
and
for
one
long
hour
did
he
keep
up
an
incessant
fire
the
coming
storm
was
now
plainly
discernible
the
distant
rolling
of
thunder
was
heard
the
sea
was
agitated
and
occasionally
a
flaw
would
shake
the
rattlings
they
were
in
momentary
expectation
that
the
storm
would
burst
upon
them
harry
had
left
his
firing
and
ascending
the
hurricane
deck
stood
with
folded
arms
as
if
bracing
himself
to
meet
the
foe
it
is
coming
in
all
its
fury
kind
heaven
the
fog
lifts
it
rolls
itself
away
as
it
were
a
great
scroll
the
heavens
are
fearfully
majestic
seen
in
the
lightning
lurid
glare
a
speck
yes
is
the
boats
do
they
see
them
once
more
the
boy
flies
to
the
cannon
not
pausing
to
see
if
they
are
nearing
the
ship
his
heart
beats
wildly
is
their
only
chance
for
life
the
hurricane
has
burst
upon
them
the
enraged
deep
responds
loudly
to
the
deafening
roar
once
again
the
feeble
voice
of
the
cannon
is
doing
its
best
to
be
heard
when
lo
the
flash
mingling
with
the
forked
lightnings
which
play
in
the
rigging
reveals
the
men
as
they
come
tumbling
over
the
ship
side
they
are
saved
saved
by
that
noble
boy
who
does
not
know
of
their
approach
so
intent
is
he
upon
his
exertions
until
sampson
clasps
him
in
his
arms
and
a
god
bless
you
is
upon
the
lips
of
every
man
save
the
captain
who
having
received
a
slight
wound
from
a
harpoon
and
irritated
by
their
bad
luck
utters
a
curse
which
vies
in
blackness
with
that
dreadful
night
down
your
helm
shouted
the
captain
hard
down
your
helm
the
order
was
hardly
given
when
they
were
thrown
on
their
beam
ends
down
down
they
went
as
if
never
to
rise
again
completely
engulfed
in
the
dark
abyss
the
boy
where
is
he
down
in
the
hold
his
arm
made
fast
to
the
collar
of
old
neptune
that
they
may
go
down
together
he
kneels
his
mother
gift
the
bible
in
his
hand
calmly
awaiting
his
time
nature
seems
terrified
yet
that
boy
knows
no
fear
crash
succeeds
crash
ah
who
can
describe
the
scene
he
alone
who
has
stood
upon
the
frail
plank
which
only
separates
him
from
death
again
a
terrific
crash
their
masts
have
gone
by
the
board
it
would
seem
that
the
enraged
billows
were
bent
upon
their
destruction
still
their
stout
bark
is
unwilling
to
give
up
and
trembling
from
stem
to
stern
she
clings
to
life
nobly
resisting
the
gigantic
attacks
of
the
who
having
fought
with
terrific
fierceness
through
the
livelong
night
puts
on
a
less
expression
as
his
strength
is
well
nigh
spent
and
the
gray
dawn
sees
no
traces
of
the
despoiler
who
perhaps
has
slain
thousands
save
the
swelling
surges
which
angrily
gaze
as
if
disappointed
of
their
prey
at
the
first
dawn
of
day
harry
went
on
deck
to
learn
their
situation
what
a
change
had
been
wrought
in
a
few
hours
their
masts
had
been
carried
away
the
decks
had
been
swept
clean
and
he
learned
that
several
poor
fellows
had
lost
their
hold
and
were
not
seen
more
well
i
be
d
d
if
that
son
of
a
cannibal
has
sneaked
away
into
some
hole
and
kept
his
footing
exclaimed
the
captain
as
he
saw
the
boy
appear
above
deck
i
was
in
hopes
he
had
found
safe
quarters
in
davy
jones
locker
but
there
no
getting
rid
of
such
scalawags
captain
jostler
cried
sampson
raising
his
hat
it
none
of
my
business
and
you
may
knock
me
down
the
next
minute
if
you
please
but
god
knows
there
not
a
man
aboard
but
owes
his
life
to
that
boy
i
have
no
mutinous
designs
sir
but
at
such
a
moment
as
this
i
will
speak
sir
come
what
will
and
thank
god
the
boy
had
sense
enough
to
go
below
when
he
knew
he
could
be
of
no
use
here
the
captain
looked
daggers
he
was
about
to
seize
sampson
by
the
throat
when
a
voice
from
the
assembled
crew
was
heard
three
cheers
and
long
life
to
the
boy
captain
or
no
captain
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
the
grateful
tars
making
the
welkin
ring
if
jostler
had
had
the
heart
of
a
brave
noble
he
would
have
fought
right
and
left
till
the
last
ere
his
men
should
dare
to
show
such
insubordination
setting
his
authority
at
defiance
but
he
was
a
coward
and
they
were
seamen
who
would
not
see
the
innocent
trampled
upon
consequently
the
villain
had
to
swallow
his
wrath
but
he
was
determined
to
have
his
revenge
and
sampson
noticed
that
he
cast
an
evil
eye
upon
the
boy
upon
examination
it
was
found
they
had
sustained
no
injuries
besides
the
loss
of
the
masts
except
that
a
small
leakage
had
been
made
near
the
bows
and
that
was
soon
repaired
by
the
carpenter
who
proceeded
to
rig
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
put
in
a
condition
capable
of
running
into
the
islands
for
repairs
about
sunrise
signals
of
distress
were
heard
and
by
the
glass
a
dismasted
ship
was
made
out
a
long
way
astern
apparently
in
a
sinking
condition
the
captain
appeared
to
take
little
notice
of
her
and
as
the
mate
ventured
to
inquire
if
they
should
ship
he
answered
thunder
no
we
are
safe
let
them
run
their
own
chance
harry
hearing
his
reply
was
shocked
could
the
man
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
those
repeated
sounds
of
distress
when
it
was
in
his
power
to
save
them
ah
boy
it
is
even
so
but
he
is
not
a
man
harry
could
endure
the
thought
no
longer
as
fainter
and
fainter
grew
the
reports
as
they
bore
away
from
them
he
begged
sampson
to
implore
the
captain
to
return
sampson
telling
him
it
was
of
no
use
that
it
would
not
do
to
cross
him
again
then
i
will
go
myself
to
him
he
can
not
have
the
heart
to
leave
them
to
perish
rash
boy
your
life
will
be
the
penalty
you
must
not
do
it
i
will
do
my
duty
though
i
should
die
for
it
there
is
the
least
possibility
of
his
hearing
me
and
what
is
one
life
compared
with
it
may
be
a
hundred
stay
mad
boy
cried
sampson
but
he
had
gone
reaching
the
upon
his
knees
he
implored
the
captain
to
return
think
if
it
were
your
father
brother
or
a
son
in
that
hopeless
condition
would
you
not
render
them
all
the
assistance
in
your
power
i
have
three
brothers
and
a
father
upon
the
ocean
vociferated
the
demon
for
aught
i
know
it
may
be
one
of
them
but
were
they
all
aboard
that
hulk
yonder
i
would
not
return
but
who
are
you
sirrah
that
dares
to
usurp
my
power
now
upstart
you
shall
know
your
place
and
he
seized
him
by
the
collar
bore
him
aft
lashed
him
to
a
spar
called
for
the
cat
and
lifting
it
high
in
air
it
falls
but
the
cursed
invention
of
man
cruelty
falls
wide
of
its
mark
ere
its
descent
had
scarred
that
fair
brow
a
rush
was
heard
from
the
main
gangway
and
old
neptune
with
a
fierce
growl
has
fastened
his
teeth
in
the
flesh
quick
as
thought
his
master
called
him
off
and
every
man
stood
trembling
as
they
observed
the
captain
feeling
for
his
pistols
but
his
strength
failed
him
the
dog
had
met
his
teeth
in
the
wound
received
by
the
mismanagement
of
the
harpoon
tearing
the
flesh
nearly
from
off
his
limb
it
really
was
a
pitiable
sight
to
behold
faint
from
the
loss
of
blood
he
was
carried
below
where
his
wound
was
dressed
by
one
of
the
men
having
no
regular
surgeon
aboard
consequently
its
fatality
was
not
realized
the
groans
and
writhings
of
the
sufferer
were
all
day
long
did
he
rave
imploring
sampson
who
attended
him
to
take
the
fiend
away
that
he
was
being
devoured
alive
and
thus
did
he
toss
upon
his
bed
till
toward
evening
when
a
change
for
the
worse
came
over
him
sampson
saw
that
the
seal
of
death
was
stamped
upon
his
features
and
at
set
of
sun
with
an
imprecation
upon
his
dying
lips
he
had
breathed
his
last
o
how
fearful
to
enter
that
spirit
land
thus
unprepared
to
come
before
our
judge
with
a
soul
stained
in
the
deepest
sins
trembling
with
its
burden
of
guilt
lord
grant
that
we
be
not
thus
found
when
thou
shalt
call
give
us
strength
to
overcome
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
so
that
at
the
last
we
shall
taste
those
joys
which
exist
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
they
buried
him
in
the
deep
sea
perhaps
his
body
lay
side
by
side
with
those
who
through
his
unfeeling
heart
had
found
a
watery
grave
but
we
trust
that
unlike
him
they
had
gone
to
meet
the
reward
of
having
lived
an
holy
life
gone
to
the
sailor
home
in
the
skies
the
stars
shone
out
one
by
one
in
the
firmament
when
the
king
of
day
had
descended
calmly
the
night
looked
down
and
undisturbed
were
harry
thoughts
as
seated
upon
the
taffrail
old
neptune
by
his
side
he
once
again
breathed
the
air
of
liberty
not
that
he
rejoiced
that
he
was
thus
freed
from
him
who
had
kept
him
in
perfect
slavery
for
he
alone
had
dropped
a
tear
over
the
uncoffined
burial
of
his
persecutor
but
his
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
as
he
looked
into
the
peerless
night
gratitude
to
him
who
has
given
us
a
soul
that
we
may
admire
the
works
of
his
hands
as
harry
sat
musing
turning
from
the
heavenly
orbs
to
their
semblance
on
the
bosom
of
the
placid
waters
he
observed
as
it
were
a
fallen
star
mirrored
therein
but
rousing
his
dreamy
senses
he
found
it
was
a
small
shining
object
floating
near
them
he
drew
it
from
the
water
it
was
a
block
of
wood
in
the
form
of
an
octagon
highly
polished
inlaid
with
bits
of
pearl
forming
grotesque
figures
and
thickly
studded
with
some
bright
mineral
representing
stars
which
gave
it
a
very
handsome
appearance
well
if
the
youngster
is
picking
up
moonshine
remarked
sampson
examining
the
curiosity
some
poor
fellow
designed
that
for
his
sweetheart
likely
but
i
suppose
it
will
make
but
little
difference
with
her
if
she
hears
he
among
the
missing
she
can
just
as
well
set
her
colors
for
another
these
butterflies
go
upon
the
principle
that
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
was
caught
o
ho
sampson
cried
the
jolly
faced
mate
who
had
now
taken
the
captain
berth
you
are
inclined
to
give
the
fair
ones
no
quarters
i
should
wonder
if
they
had
given
you
the
slip
in
some
of
your
cruisings
well
sir
nothing
of
that
kind
exactly
i
never
had
much
notion
for
shipping
under
one
captain
for
life
a
little
frightened
eh
well
between
you
and
i
i
was
a
little
skeery
for
fear
i
should
find
my
mate
at
the
helm
yes
but
you
do
mean
to
say
woman
is
a
craft
sailing
without
a
compass
do
you
that
is
minus
a
heart
aye
aye
but
it
hard
to
get
in
their
wake
i
never
met
but
one
woman
in
my
life
and
she
has
gone
where
such
as
she
do
go
ah
that
was
a
hard
time
i
was
the
only
one
saved
of
two
hundred
how
was
that
sampson
come
spin
us
that
yarn
land
ho
land
ho
hailed
the
lookout
and
every
eye
welcomed
manilla
as
they
ran
in
for
repairs
after
cruising
about
for
months
without
taking
a
drop
of
oil
harry
was
delighted
with
the
prospect
before
him
and
laying
the
little
curiosity
which
would
remind
him
of
a
sad
event
in
his
voyage
away
with
his
bible
he
entered
upon
the
duties
before
him
with
his
whole
heart
realizing
the
visions
of
his
earlier
days
and
gaining
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
life
of
a
sailor
boy

some
days
are

the

that
every
life
be
to
a
greater

fraught
with
that
element

we
term
sorrow

would
glide
passively
along
the

river

smiles

how
grateful
should
we
be
to
him
who
has
permitted
us
to
drink
of
the
same
cup
with
his
only
son
for
he
was
a
man
of
sorrows

acquainted
with
grief

is
so
blind

will
not

it
was
the
morning
after
the
sailing
of
the
nautilus
the
had
arisen
with
the
sun
and
calling
for
old
nep
as
was
her
wont
to
accompany
her
on
her
morning
walk
she
tripped
lightly
along
humming
a
farewell
to
the
last
altheas
as
they
nodded
their
shrivelled
heads
in
view
of
their
departure
but
their
words
of
adieu
were
made
brief
by
a
voice
as
of
one
in
distress
and
coming
near
it
proved
to
be
the
musical
vingo
trilling
the
wild
melodies
of
his
old
virginia
days
good
morning
vingo
you
must
have
been
up
a
long
time
to
have
been
away
down
to
the
shore
you
must
take
it
easier
and
get
more
sleep
even
old
nep
dislikes
to
leave
his
warm
kennel
this
cool
morning
for
he
did
not
come
at
my
call
and
so
i
would
not
disturb
him
ah

holding

soon
remarked
vingo
endeavoring
to
smooth
his
face
into
a
proper
state
of
sobriety
gently
the
tapped
at
her
brother
door
but
receiving
no
answer
she
ventured
in
the
room
was
in
the
same
order
in
which
she
had
left
it
the
day
before
for
she
took
great
pleasure
in
arranging
the
flowers
upon
his
dressing
table
and
no
one
could
impart
such
a
coziness
arranging
everything
to
his
mind
as
could
the
bed
had
not
been
disturbed
and
the
book
from
which
she
had
read
to
him
was
lying
thereon
opened
at
those
beautiful
verses
of
the
iris
of
the
deep
which
he
loved
so
well
to
hear
her
read
what
could
it
mean
calmly
her
breath
came
and
went
but
for
that
she
appeared
like
a
beautiful
piece
of
statuary
her
eyes
turned
upward
as
if
seeking
for
strength
to
meet
the
vague
sense
of
desolation
which
was
creeping
into
her
heart
upon
the
table
were
two
notes
one
addressed
to
her
mother
the
other
to
herself
in
his
with
nerveless
hand
she
broke
the
seal
no
emotion
was
visible
save
the
delicate
glow
upon
her
cheek
which
came
and
went
and
the
playing
of
the
muscles
about
her
compressed
lips
as
she
read
the
following
my
sister
when
you
read
this
i
shall
be
far
away
sailing
over
those
glorious
billows
which
you
and
i
love
so
well
you
will
miss
me
for
i
know
you
love
your
erring
brother
with
all
his
faults
and
even
you
who
can
realize
what
were
my
heart
desires
will
hardly
forgive
the
step
which
brings
such
deep
grief
upon
our
mother
yet
you
will
think
of
me
with
kindness
for
i
know
it
can
not
be
otherwise
there
is
no
spot
within
your
heart
of
love
which
is
not
occupied
could
i
have
left
home
with
a
mother
blessing
i
should
be
happier
but
she
will
pray
for
her
boy
the
gentle
breeze
which
fills
our
sail
will
bear
her
god
bless
you
to
the
ear
of
him
who
will
think
of
the
dear
ones
at
home
until
he
shall
once
more
fill
his
place
in
that
dearest
of
family
circles
and
thank
god
my
mother
has
such
an
one
as
you
to
lean
upon
farewell
dear
until
we
meet
again
brother
harry
he
had
gone
could
it
be
possible
how
could
she
speak
those
cruel
words
to
her
mother
yet
it
must
be
with
steady
step
she
entered
the
the
mother
looked
upon
her
child
that
which
she
would
speak
failed
to
give
utterance
instinctively
soul
sympathized
with
soul
mother
we
will
breathe
our
morning
supplication
to
him
who
ordereth
all
things
and
the
at
that
family
altar
prayed
that
strength
might
be
given
them
that
they
might
be
prepared
for
whatever
was
to
be
their
portion
and
her
prayer
was
heard
arising
grosvenor
sank
into
a
chair
with
an
agitated
voice
she
spoke
my
child
some
dreadful
thing
has
occurred
my
son
tell
me
has
he
gone
for
the
same
mysterious
power
which
bade
me
impress
upon
his
mind
last
night
the
value
of
the
instructions
which
i
pray
god
i
have
not
been
unfaithful
in
setting
before
him
tells
me
i
shall
not
see
my
boy
again
for
many
long
days
speak
my
child
is
it
not
so
you
have
spoken
too
truly
mother
may
you
be
able
to
bear
up
under
this
affliction
and
she
put
the
note
into
her
mother
hand
my
eyes
fail
me
my
child
if
it
is
not
asking
of
you
too
much
tell
me
what
were
his
last
words
they
will
fall
more
gently
on
my
heart
and
the
tones
of
the
were
of
comfort
as
she
read
my
dear
mother
in
the
ship
nautilus
which
will
sail
from
this
port
on
the
of
october
i
have
shipped
for
a
cape
horn
voyage
you
will
hardly
believe
what
you
read
nevertheless
it
is
true
i
was
very
much
disappointed
that
i
could
not
go
with
father
and
thought
i
would
wait
patiently
until
his
return
but
gaining
permission
from
my
present
captain
to
accompany
him
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
i
know
i
shall
do
very
wrong
in
going
away
without
your
consent
but
forgive
me
if
you
can
mother
is
the
only
act
in
which
i
have
ever
given
you
sorrow
or
by
which
i
ever
shall
you
shall
hear
from
me
as
often
as
i
can
get
an
opportunity
of
sending
home
and
it
will
not
be
a
great
while
before
i
shall
be
with
you
again
i
shall
not
forget
my
prayers
night
and
morning
and
i
know
you
will
not
cease
to
pray
for
your
son
though
he
should
fall
to
the
lowest
depths
of
degradation
tell
father
when
you
write
him
that
i
have
disobeyed
his
word
but
ask
him
if
he
can
not
forgive
me
it
is
possible
that
i
may
meet
with
him
upon
the
ocean
and
may
we
both
be
spared
to
make
you
happy
my
dear
mother
farewell
from
your
affectionate
son
i
do
forgive
you
my
son
in
this
cruel
step
which
you
have
taken
indeed
but
how
could
he
do
thus
oh
how
could
he
and
grosvenor
overcome
with
her
emotion
sank
back
in
her
chair
de
good
lord
be
praised
missy
but
i
not
tink
it
eber

to

but
i
never
tink
young
massa
take
hesef
clean
off
and
wiping
the
whites
of
his
eyes
he
went
out
to
hunt
up
old
nep
to
share
his
grief
but
he
soon
returned
and
locking
the
door
after
him
proceeded
to
fasten
every
window
in
the
house
who
was
bathing
her
mother
temples
observing
what
the
negro
was
about
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
his
movements
but
knowing
he
disliked
to
be
questioned
upon
points
touching
his
judgment
she
humored
him
by
letting
him
have
his
own
way
till
finally
he
peered
into
his
mistress
face
and
in
a
voice
scarcely
above
a
whisper
said
dar
missy
de
rest
ob
us
am
safe
he
no
cotch
any
more
dis
time
what
is
it
vingo
what

like
i
never

what
is
the
matter
vingo
well

i
tinks

de
ebil
one
dat

away
after
all
for
dat

neber
go
peaceably
wid
anyting
short
ob

he
got
too
much
de
spirit
ob
his
massa
to
be
afeard
ob
anyting
dat

on
dis
earth
is
neptune
gone
too
vingo
yes
missy
dar
not
eben
a
shadow
left
ob
him
and
the
negro
had
a
remarkable
imagination
like
i
see
de
print
ob
a
cloben
tread
in
de
soft
ground
by
his
door
and
among
de
hay
de
old
fellow
hab
lef
some
ob
his
plunder
trough
mistake
hastened
to
the
dog
kennel
and
there
indeed
was
a
small
parcel
folded
neatly
in
white
paper
but
no
trace
of
the
dog
was
to
be
seen
opening
the
package
there
was
a
small
locket
containing
the
likeness
of
her
mother
and
herself
which
had
been
left
upon
the
parlor
table
but
how
it
came
in
the
dog
kennel
was
a
mystery
oh
our
faithful
neptune
how
much
we
shall
miss
him
it
must
be
that
he
has
gone
with
his
master
but
perhaps
it
is
all
for
the
best
i
tinks
eberyting
should
be
ob
de
best
for
you
missy
like
if
my
poor
old
phillis
could
get
used
to
de
tribilations
like
you

it
help
to
make
de
road
easier
but
i
specks
she
neber
learn
how
o
vingo
it
makes
my
heart
bleed
to
think
that
your
people
have
no
opportunities
for
learning
that
they
may
cast
their
burdens
on
the
lord
i
can
not
imagine
anything
more
dreadful
than
the
ignorance
in
which
the
slaves
are
kept
yes
missy
i
neber
remembers
much
about
it
till
i
leabes
old
berginny
some
how
or
oder
i
finds
out
dat
old
massa
people
hab
a
god
but
i
neber
he
know
anyting
poor
black
man
days
and
months
passed
on
as
the
lonely
days
of
sorrow
do
come
and
go
and
come
again
but
as
the
lengthened
shades
of
the
summer
solstice
had
again
become
less
another
cloud
had
arisen
in
the
firmament
of
mingled
joys
and
sorrows
threatening
to
encompass
even
the
bright
rays
of
hope
within
its
gloom
grosvenor
had
written
her
husband
of
the
conduct
of
their
truant
son
as
harry
had
wished
and
had
in
reply
received
his
full
forgiveness
for
the
boy
captain
grosvenor
had
written
that
he
much
regretted
not
having
taken
harry
along
with
him
for
said
he
a
second
thought
would
have
convinced
me
that
the
boy
had
too
much
of
the
spirit
of
his
father
to
remain
contentedly
on
shore
he
has
but
followed
in
my
footsteps
for
i
never
shall
forget
the
night
i
stole
away
from
my
father
house
when
i
was
but
ten
years
old
and
went
to
sea
yes
tell
my
boy
that
i
forgive
him
yet
it
annoys
me
very
much
that
you
and
our
dear
natalie
are
left
alone
my
wife
but
at
the
rate
we
have
been
doing
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
shall
be
homeward
bound
nearly
a
twelvemonth
had
passed
since
this
letter
had
been
received
not
a
word
had
been
heard
of
the
tantalizer
for
a
long
time
several
ships
had
returned
which
had
left
since
she
had
sailed
but
they
had
brought
no
tidings
of
her
over
a
year
had
passed
since
she
was
last
reported
and
her
owners
began
to
look
doubtful
in
regard
to
her
fate
and
there
were
rumors
that
the
tantalizer
was
counted
among
the
missing
vessels
yet
no
one
dared
to
breathe
the
thought
to
the
still
hoping
family
while
there
was
the
least
possibility
that
she
might
be
heard
from
again
and
who
would
wish
to
be
the
first
to
pronounce
that
gentle
wife
a
widow
darker
and
still
deeper
grew
the
overshadowing
cloud
and
the
hopes
of
the
trusting
ones
less
grosvenor
would
sit
for
whole
days
brooding
over
her
sorrows
clinging
to
the
last
ray
of
hope
with
almost
the
insanity
of
hope
but
the
last
spark
finally
went
out
never
again
to
be
rekindled
the
untiring
wheels
of
time
still
went
their
rounds
and
everything
moved
on
as
if
there
were
no
hearts
beating
in
discordant
measure
to
the
joyous
song
of
nature
sympathizing
friends
pitied
the
afflicted
and
the
world
read
a
noble
ship
lost
at
sea
all
on
board
supposed
to
have
perished
ship
and
cargo
valued
at
thirty
thousand
dollars
no
insurance
and
they
exclaim
ah
the
life
is
indeed
hard
but
they
dwell
upon
the
latter
clause
of
the
paragraph
with
as
much
real
pity
the
words
fall
upon
their
ear
conveying
as
much
of
real
sadness
to
their
minds
as
that
many
families
have
been
called
to
mourn
the
loss
of
one
of
their
members
the
could
hardly
become
reconciled
to
the
thought
that
she
would
never
see
her
father
more
yet
for
her
mother
sake
she
suppressed
her
grief
endeavoring
to
soothe
her
weary
spirits
by
those
refreshing
promises
of
him
who
dries
the
mourner
tear
binding
up
the
wounds
of
the
dear
mother
we
are
called
upon
to
bear
a
heavy
trial
this
is
indeed
a
bitter
bitter
draught
yet
we
must
not
forget
is
our
father
holds
the
cup
you
have
taught
me
to
smile
upon
his
chastening
rod
but
in
this
dark
hour
of
trial
truly
the
flesh
is
weak
yet
we
will
rest
upon
the
strength
of
his
arm
he
will
not
forsake
us
and
mother
his
ways
indeed
are
higher
than
our
ways
how
tenderly
has
he
dealt
with
us
inasmuch
as
he
has
so
ordered
that
our
dear
harry
should
be
spared
to
us
for
as
i
look
upon
the
past
i
can
see
nothing
but
the
kindly
interference
of
his
will
that
my
brother
did
not
share
the
same
grave
with
his
father
my
darling
your
precious
words
shed
light
over
my
weary
pathway
i
fear
that
i
have
sinned
in
thus
murmuring
at
god
will
for
i
would
not
see
his
loving
kindness
in
sparing
to
me
my
boy
but
it
is
so
very
hard
so
dreadful
that
in
that
hour
when
his
spirit
winged
its
way
to
that
better
land
we
might
not
pause
from
our
worldly
pursuits
turning
our
eyes
heavenward
craving
strength
to
bear
our
cross
but
your
words
of
love
my
child
remind
me
of
that
being
who
is
the
of
loveliness
and
i
thank
god
for
his
gift
of
you
if
i
am
a
comfort
to
you
mother
it
is
through
your
influence
for
you
have
taught
me
to
walk
in
the
paths
of
virtue
true
i
have
pointed
out
to
you
the
ways
of
righteousness
but
when
you
looked
upon
that
bright
river
of
life
i
observed
that
its
waters
were
no
less
tranquil
and
mirrored
upon
its
bosom
was
one
more
shining
star
and
it
has
been
increasing
in
magnitude
till
now
its
radiance
illumes
even
the
bright
river
itself
so
did
the
gather
together
the
broken
threads
of
this
family
weaving
them
closer
with
that
golden
thread
of
tender
remembrance
of
him
who
had
gone
to
await
them
for
a
little
in
that
happier
home
above
this
family
of
which
she
had
never
the
slightest
suspicion
but
that
they
were
of
her
own
flesh
and
blood
and
as
she
sat
with
her
hand
clasped
within
that
of
her
mother
reading
from
that
blessed
book
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
are
weary
grosvenor
could
not
but
notice
the
striking
resemblance
which
she
bore
to
those
lovely
features
of
the
miniature
which
was
found
within
the
golden
band
the
child
was
growing
to
resemble
her
unknown
mother
and
were
there
any
who
had
ever
known
the
parents
to
see
their
child
they
could
not
but
have
discovered
her
descent
as
the
thought
came
to
grosvenor
mind
she
shuddered
and
she
asked
herself
if
it
could
ever
be
that
her
darling
should
be
torn
from
her
if
another
cloud
would
arise
hiding
one
more
cherished
one
from
her
sight
but
why
should
she
tremble
at
the
thought
she
well
knew
there
could
be
nothing
not
even
the
discovery
of
relatives
which
could
lessen
her
daughter
love
for
her
mother
not
a
word
had
ever
been
said
to
the
child
in
regard
to
her
mysterious
parentage
captain
grosvenor
had
thought
it
best
not
to
reveal
the
fact
until
she
should
have
become
of
a
suitable
age
to
fully
realize
her
situation
those
who
had
known
the
circumstances
of
her
discovery
had
gradually
come
to
look
upon
her
as
the
child
of
those
who
treasured
her
as
if
she
had
been
their
own
and
the
playmates
of
her
childhood
days
had
never
mistrusted
there
was
a
mystery
hanging
about
her
romantic
name
harry
indeed
had
never
forgotten
his
delight
at
having
a
new
sister
and
as
they
had
grown
up
together
he
had
often
looked
into
her
dreamy
eyes
and
thought
how
unlike
she
is
to
any
one
else
she
is
too
good
to
be
my
sister
and
as
the
reality
came
to
him
he
had
banished
the
remembrance
ere
it
had
taken
to
itself
a
form
the
original
vingo
had
never
lost
sight
of
that
commentful
day
as
he
termed
it
not
a
day
passed
but
he
made
some
allusion
to
dat
wee
gem
among
de
and
the
would
open
wide
her
eyes
as
from
his
wild
laugh
she
caught
his
broken
sentences
and
would
wonder
why
the
negro
words
should
meet
with
such
a
response
within
her
own
bosom
the
dress
together
with
the
ornaments
which
had
been
found
upon
her
had
been
laid
carefully
away
reserved
until
she
should
have
become
familiar
with
her
history
but
grosvenor
since
the
loss
of
her
husband
had
weighed
the
question
in
her
mind
whether
she
should
still
keep
the
secret
from
her
for
the
child
mind
was
much
beyond
her
years
and
she
questioned
whether
it
would
be
for
the
best
to
permit
her
to
grow
to
maturer
years
thus
undeceived
but
she
reflected
that
such
had
been
the
design
of
her
husband
and
therefore
for
the
present
the
subject
was
dismissed
from
her
mind
it
was
the
close
of
the
third
year
in
which
harry
had
been
from
home
grosvenor
had
received
four
letters
from
him
in
that
time
his
last
had
stated
they
were
doing
well
that
he
was
under
one
of
the
kindest
of
captains
and
all
that
was
wanting
to
make
him
perfectly
happy
was
to
see
his
dear
mother
and
the
rest
of
the
family
once
more
poor
boy
he
little
thought
that
there
was
one
of
its
members
whom
he
would
never
see
again
until
he
had
passed
over
that
sea
from
which
no
navigator
ever
returns
harry
had
never
written
his
mother
of
the
brutal
treatment
which
he
had
received
from
his
first
captain
but
he
had
said
that
neptune
had
been
the
means
of
saving
his
life
and
that
the
old
fellow
was
getting
to
be
quite
a
sailor
inasmuch
as
he
could
take
a
turn
on
the
with
as
much
dignity
as
the
captain
himself
it
had
been
some
time
since
harry
last
letter
had
been
received
and
now
grosvenor
was
anxiously
looking
for
news
from
him
with
a
state
of
mind
prepared
for
receiving
almost
anything
so
fraught
with
sad
events
had
been
the
last
few
years
when
one
day
vingo
was
seen
far
down
the
street
coaxing
his
limbs
into
a
run
and
bursting
into
the
room
he
stood
panting
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
grinning
with
delight
and
holding
at
arm
length
a
letter
which
grosvenor
recognized
as
coming
from
her
son
the
read
the
letter
aloud
and
when
vingo
learned
that
massa
harry
was
homeward
bound
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
go
beside
himself
at
the
thought
of
having
his
young
massa
home
once
more
for
everything
had
appeared
so
different
since
he
went
away
there
had
been
so
many
changes
that
the
fellow
had
really
had
his
fears
that
it
might
be
his
turn
next
to
be
taken
off
and
he
had
often
had
visions
of
his
old
slave
massa
in
nearer
proximity
than
was
at
all
consistent
with
his
ideas
of
liberty
de
good
lord
be
praised
exclaimed
the
negro
as
ceased
reading
dis
am
too
good
news
for
old
black
man
live
me
but
i
knew
de
bright
sunshine
not
be
contented
to
stay
away
from
missy
long
i
tinks
missy
get
along
better
widout
him
dan
he
can
widout
her
but
dar
am
some
poor
souls
dat
neber
sees
de
shine
making
dem
feel
as
full
ob
sing
as
a
and
the
negro
gave
a
deep
sigh
at
the
remembrance
of
his
poor
old
phillis
who
was
for
aught
he
knew
still
wearing
the
accursed
yoke
of
slavery
poor
things
poor
things
sighed
the
i
would
willingly
share
with
them
my
joys
were
it
in
my
power
theirs
would
be
a
lighter
burden
to
those
who
have
learned
of
that
glorious
home
where
the
resplendent
shining
of
its
bright
ones
is
forever
but
they
alas
have
no
bright
future
to
look
forward
to
giving
them
renewed
strength
to
bear
their
cross
or
if
they
ever
hear
of
that
who
hears
the
cry
of
the
most
wretched
of
his
children
their
masters
would
have
them
believe
that
he
is
but
the
white
man
god
oh
vingo
how
could
you
have
had
the
heart
to
believe
that
god
would
disown
his
children

boots
dat

instant
at

rather
sober
like

sot
a
heap
on
de

uns
dat
was
comin

enough
soon
to

and
like

an
account
for

they
have
done

pleasanter
but
do
not
look
upon
your
life
in
slavery
as
having
been
unprofitably
spent
for
the
very
darkness
through
which
you
have
come
serves
to
make
brighter
that
glorious
light
which
is
now
shed
your

your
sad
tale
has
impressed
me
with
renewed
gratitude
to
our
father
for
his
mercies
towards

and
while
i

from
his

with
these
joys

moore
sampson
sampson
just
step
this
way
and
bring
your
eye
to
bear
a
little
to
the
and
tell
me
what
you
make
make
boy
make
exclaimed
sampson
thrusting
a
huge
piece
of
pigtail
into
his
already
overcharged
capacious
mouth
i
suppose
you
would
have
me
believe
that
you
made
the
light
of
some
eyes
outshining
even
old
sankoty
itself
three
years
ago
do
you
remember
it
sampson
when
i
was
a
mere
stripling
you
took
me
aside
and
pointed
out
a
dim
light
away
down
to
the
water
edge
and
told
me
i
would
have
seen
different
days
before
i
made
it
again
do
you
think
i
can
ever
forget
it
i
could
tell
its
light
from
among
a
thousand
as
i
caught
its
last
rays
then
it
seemed
to
me
the
pensive
forgiving
smile
of
my
mother
for
as
you
know
i
came
away
from
home
without
my
mother
consent
but
i
long
ago
received
her
forgiveness
and
everything
will
be
forgotten
in
the
happiness
which
we
shall
enjoy
at
meeting
once
more
and
my
father
he
is
at
home
by
this
time
how
surprised
they
will
all
be
to
see
me
grown
almost
to
be
a
man
i
hope
the
is
the
same
little
fairy
still
she
will
not
always
be
a
bud
however
yet
the
opening
flower
has
greater
charms
bless
my
stars
boy
are
you
losing
your
senses
asked
the
astonished
sampson
as
harry
walked
the
deck
in
raptures
talking
as
fast
as
his
tongue
could
fly
as
it
appeared
to
the
old
tar
in
riddles
what
got
into
your
head
boy
i
have
always
taken
you
to
be
the
most
sensible
person
aboard
but
shiver
my
topsails
if
the
fellow
talk
as
if
he
expected
to
find
old
vineyard
sound
turned
into
a
flower
garden
with
a
fairy
made
fast
to
every
other
blossom
as
sampson
delivered
himself
of
this
ludicrous
remark
harry
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
and
handing
the
tar
his
glass
he
sang
out
sankoty
light
ahoy
which
brought
all
hands
on
deck
in
an
instant
rubbing
open
their
eyes
for
it
was
but
the
second
watch
in
the
morning
to
catch
sight
of
the
first
object
visible
of
their
homes
three
cheers
for
old
nantucket
and
young
grosvenor
shouted
the
captain
and
the
ready
huzza
which
went
up
amid
the
waving
of
sundry
flannel
shirts
old
boots
and
forsaken
tarpaulins
which
had
been
caught
up
by
the
unshorn
tars
as
the
sound
of
their
near
proximity
to
home
aroused
them
from
the
dreamy
visions
thereof
to
the
vivid
realities
were
borne
over
the
waters
which
separated
them
from
thence
deceiving
the
heralds
of
the
day
into
the
belief
of
an
early
dawn
judging
from
the
signs
of
recognition
which
met
their
approach
as
the
first
tinge
of
red
lit
up
the
eastern
sky
nobly
the
good
ship
nautilus
bore
down
to
the
bar
setting
heavily
on
the
water
and
the
good
hundred
with
which
she
was
laden
was
no
less
weighty
than
the
handfuls
of
silver
which
danced
the
minds
of
the
glad
sailor
boys
as
they
neared
their
native
shore
none
were
more
at
the
prospect
before
them
than
harry
grosvenor
not
that
he
had
become
weary
of
the
sailor
life
for
he
loved
the
ocean
with
the
same
free
wild
love
as
when
three
years
before
it
had
beckoned
his
boyish
heart
to
brave
its
perils
but
his
joy
as
the
endeared
objects
of
his
home
one
by
one
welcomed
him
in
his
fancy
was
unbounded
and
he
could
not
realize
that
he
should
so
soon
greet
the
dear
ones
who
had
been
the
subjects
of
his
most
precious
thoughts
through
the
many
days
which
had
separated
them
well
my
boy
said
sampson
as
he
grasped
harry
by
the
hand
sailed
under
a
clear
sky
for
the
most
of
the
time
and
we
held
together
about
as
good
as
the
strongest
but
there
no
use
in
shedding
fresh
water
tears
over
it
for
i
thinking
this
not
be
your
last
voyage
and
as
for
me
there
nothing
to
hinder
my
hanging
around
this
little
a
bit
longer
and
who
knows
but
we
may
try
it
again
some
day
who
knows
ah
who
knows
that
john
sampson
is
not
lying
at
this
moment
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
who
is
there
that
cares
to
know
this
i
know
is
not
your
home
sampson
but
have
you
not
one
friend
is
there
no
spot
in
the
wide
world
which
is
dear
to
you
is
there
not
one
who
will
welcome
you
home
all
places
are
the
same
to
me
and
i
can
truly
say
there
is
not
a
person
on
the
whole
earth
that
would
ship
to
get
a
look
at
me
to
be
sure
i
was
brought
up
somehow
till
i
was
able
to
take
myself
up
but
by
whom
or
where
is
farther
back
than
the
story
goes
all
i
know
is
i
found
myself
at
six
years
old
on
the
top
of
a
london
dust
heap
taking
a
survey
of
the
great
metropolis
whether
i
was
left
there
by
the
refuse
gatherers
to
come
under
the
head
of
starved
dogs
or
whether
i
was
accidentally
dropped
by
my
lawful
owner
it
do
make
much
difference
well
i
shook
the
dust
out
of
my
eyes
and
made
for
the
water
and
i
lived
on
the
water
for
the
most
part
ever
since
but
there
one
comfort
about
it
i
never
been
troubled
with
poor
relations
added
he
jocosely
sampson
yours
is
a
strange
history
and
what
is
stranger
still
that
you
have
not
in
all
your
yarns
in
the
forecastle
spun
us
this
one
but
have
you
never
in
all
your
wanderings
met
with
those
whom
you
can
call
your
friends
a
rough
old
tar
like
me
i
must
say
would
not
be
the
most
inviting
craft
to
interchange
signals
with
but
thank
god
i
have
found
one
in
my
long
life
of
wanderings
who
was
worthy
the
name
of
friend
but
she
kind
beautiful
lady
is
gone
and
the
rough
tar
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
and
turning
toward
the
island
muttered
twelve
yes
fifteen
years
ago
this
very
month
and
i
the
only
one
saved
i
worked
hard
but
it
was
of
no
use
it
was
to
be
i
gladly
have
gone
down
to
have
saved
her
well
sampson
i
think
it
is
you
who
are
losing
your
senses
now
said
harry
as
he
listened
to
his
inaudible
words
but
you
shall
not
say
you
have
not
a
friend
so
long
as
my
craft
sails
the
ocean
for
i
never
shall
forget
your
kindness
to
me
and
my
faithful
old
nep
while
exposed
to
the
harsh
treatment
of
our
former
captain
and
depend
upon
it
you
will
have
made
other
true
friends
when
the
dear
ones
at
home
shall
have
heard
of
your
generous
conduct
i
have
one
of
the
best
of
mothers
sampson
and
a
sister
who
would
make
you
a
better
man
to
look
into
her
eyes
a
likeness
of
her
was
among
my
valuables
when
i
left
home
but
it
has
been
by
some
means
mislaid
a
better
man
eh
well
there
room
enough
for
that
i
shall
have
to
lie
under
a
close
reef
and
by
the
help
of
my
glass
i
may
get
sight
of
her
some
day
the
crew
of
the
nautilus
after
having
made
themselves
as
tidy
as
a
six
months
beard
and
a
suit
of
three
years
usage
would
admit
prepared
to
go
ashore
as
harry
stepped
upon
the
wharf
he
looked
among
the
ships
lying
at
the
dock
for
the
tantalizer
but
not
seeing
her
he
concluded
she
must
have
put
to
sea
again
and
taking
his
package
upon
his
shoulder
he
whistled
for
neptune
and
turned
his
footsteps
homeward
how
familiar
was
every
object
as
he
tripped
along
the
street
everything
appeared
the
same
as
when
he
left
and
as
he
passed
the
old
church
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
but
yesterday
when
he
had
kneeled
upon
the
in
prayer
for
those
who
were
sleeping
unconscious
of
the
sorrow
which
awaited
them
his
heart
beat
wildly
as
he
drew
near
his
home
so
great
was
his
joy
that
he
had
not
observed
that
nep
had
not
accompanied
him
from
the
ship
it
was
evident
that
he
would
take
the
family
by
surprise
for
not
even
old
vingo
was
to
be
seen
about
the
premises
noiselessly
he
opened
the
door
his
mother
was
sitting
with
her
face
from
him
engaged
with
her
sewing
and
at
her
feet
sat
the
so
absorbed
reading
his
last
letter
that
she
was
not
aware
of
his
presence
till
he
threw
his
arms
about
his
mother
neck
and
sobbed
like
a
child
as
he
turned
to
his
sister
he
faltered
what
a
change
had
been
wrought
in
her
in
three
years
the
child
whose
mature
mind
had
not
been
in
accordance
with
her
years
had
come
to
be
a
fair
maiden
of
sixteen
summers
the
bud
had
indeed
expanded
till
now
its
unfolding
leaves
were
as
rays
of
love
reminding
earth
of
heaven
the
saw
that
her
brother
hesitated
in
giving
her
his
usual
salutation
and
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
she
said
i
am
the
little
still
dear
harry
i
shall
always
be
the
same
simple
child
but
how
you
have
grown
dear
brother
i
can
hardly
believe
you
are
the
little
rogue
who
used
to
hide
my
pet
kitten
because
you
loved
to
see
the
tears
come
into
my
eyes
and
you
would
look
at
me
without
speaking
a
word
till
i
would
laugh
outright
and
break
the
charm
as
you
said
and
then
the
tears
would
come
in
your
own
eyes
for
fear
you
had
been
selfish
but
i
felt
that
my
tears
were
not
in
vain
for
i
usually
found
some
little
stranger
among
the
ones
that
looked
up
to
me
for
protection
i
knew
i
should
find
you
the
same
dear
sister
as
ever
i
knew
you
would
always
be
the
same
and
as
the
vague
remembrance
that
she
was
of
other
parentage
flashed
across
his
mind
he
modestly
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
gazed
into
her
beautiful
face
in
silence
harry
observed
that
his
mother
had
lost
her
cheerful
happy
expression
which
had
given
her
the
youthful
look
not
of
her
years
and
he
feared
that
his
conduct
had
been
a
source
of
deeper
grief
to
her
than
he
had
supposed
but
now
that
she
again
looked
upon
her
son
her
pale
pensive
face
was
lit
up
with
the
smile
of
contentment
and
a
heart
of
thanks
was
hers
that
so
many
blessings
were
yet
her
portion
a
noise
which
strongly
reminded
harry
of
the
rattling
of
the
rigging
in
a
gale
of
wind
was
now
heard
in
the
hall
and
vingo
presented
himself
at
the
door
he
looked
at
harry
then
at
his
mistress
while
the
pupil
of
his
eye
gave
place
to
its
lighter
counterpart
and
raising
both
hands
he
exclaimed
de
good
lord
be
praised
like
i
be
any
fuller
ob
laugh
if
i
find
old
phillis
hersef
and
grasping
his
master
extended
hand
he
laughed
until
it
seemed
as
if
the
corners
of
his
mouth
would
meet
i
right
glad
to
see
you
young
massa
i
is
but
where
is
de
old
fellow
neptune
yes
yes
where
is
the
faithful
creature
asked
at
our
joy
in
seeing
you
we
have
quite
forgotten
him
just
then
the
dog
well
remembered
bark
was
heard
at
the
door
and
on
opening
it
the
animal
marched
in
and
laying
a
little
parcel
which
he
had
brought
in
his
mouth
upon
the
floor
he
jumped
upon
the
nearly
overpowering
her
in
his
delight
frisking
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
he
were
mad
harry
was
now
for
the
first
time
aware
that
the
dog
had
not
come
with
him
and
examining
the
parcel
which
he
had
brought
to
his
no
little
astonishment
he
found
it
was
the
identical
curiously
wrought
block
which
he
had
found
after
that
dreadful
night
of
the
storm
among
the
many
gifts
which
he
had
brought
home
to
his
mother
and
sister
he
had
forgotten
this
simple
one
and
now
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
seen
it
for
a
long
time
why
the
dog
should
have
noticed
so
trifling
a
thing
was
indeed
singular
harry
related
the
circumstances
by
which
he
had
come
in
possession
of
the
curiosity
and
from
the
presents
of
silks
crapes
fruits
which
he
had
brought
to
the
she
turned
to
the
mysterious
little
curiosity
with
a
greater
interest
examining
the
grotesque
figures
with
a
fascination
when
accidentally
pressing
a
pearl
setting
the
box
for
such
it
was
discovered
to
be
flew
open
and
revealed
to
her
bewildered
gaze
what
good
god
is
it
possible
neatly
lined
is
the
box
and
lying
therein
a
cross
the
same
which
the
had
wrought
with
her
own
hands
and
given
her
father
when
she
saw
him
last
carved
at
the
head
of
the
cross
are
these
words
you
will
soon
come
to
me
again
then
you
will
never
leave
us
the
child
last
words
to
her
father
o
how
did
they
fall
upon
her
heart
now
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
her
from
the
skies
and
unconsciously
she
looked
upward
as
if
she
might
indeed
catch
the
tones
of
her
father
voice
bidding
her
come
away
we
will
come
she
softly
whispered
we
shall
soon
be
with
you
there
and
turning
to
her
mother
she
added
it
is
not
far
that
better
land
we
may
hear
their
glad
shouts
if
we
will
listen
over
that
cross
emblematic
of
the
lamb
who
was
slain
that
we
might
live
was
shed
tears
from
a
widow
heart
but
those
tears
were
not
of
mourning
for
the
departed
for
through
her
who
was
made
but
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
those
tears
had
been
turned
into
joy
the
child
who
had
ever
walked
in
that
narrow
way
as
if
it
were
the
only
path
in
which
the
children
of
earth
might
tread
had
taught
her
bereaved
mother
that
those
precious
words
from
the
book
of
life
which
she
had
ever
recognized
but
had
not
strength
to
cling
thereto
in
the
hour
of
trial
were
truly
christ
words
of
tenderness
she
could
now
smile
upon
the
chastening
rod
those
dying
words
as
it
were
of
him
who
had
gone
were
as
balm
to
the
heart
of
grosvenor
and
the
for
what
could
be
more
dreadful
than
that
they
should
never
learn
of
his
last
moments
but
to
harry
who
had
been
just
upon
the
point
of
asking
for
his
father
it
was
as
the
dark
funeral
pall
to
his
soul
and
he
staggered
to
a
chair
where
is
my
father
he
asked
in
a
hollow
voice
in
heaven
was
the
response
of
the
there
was
silence
in
that
house
sorrow
which
had
reigned
for
a
time
around
that
hearthstone
still
lingered
striving
to
supersede
the
joy
which
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
purity
but
its
icy
touch
was
to
be
of
gentler
mien
its
cold
cold
breath
mingling
with
that
of
more
genial
spheres
helping
to
swell
the
father
thy
will
be
done
this
was
a
dreadful
announcement
to
harry
a
stroke
which
he
was
not
prepared
to
receive
and
now
did
the
past
come
to
his
remembrance
with
sickening
frenzy
that
terrific
night
he
had
at
the
peril
of
his
life
implored
that
heartless
being
to
listen
to
the
stranger
cry
of
distress
to
stretch
out
to
him
the
hand
of
brotherly
love
and
that
cry
for
help
was
now
sounding
in
his
ear
with
renewed
freshness
for
it
was
from
his
own
loved
father
oh
what
an
undutiful
son
i
have
been
cried
harry
had
i
known
then
what
i
know
now
and
yet
the
fiend
would
not
have
turned
a
hand
had
it
been
his
own
father
thank
god
i
have
his
forgiveness
for
disobeying
his
last
commands
is
the
one
great
lesson
of
my
life
and
should
i
live
a
hundred
years
i
will
never
deviate
from
what
i
think
would
have
been
my
parent
wishes
natalie
the
gazed
upon
that
name
the
name
of
her
father
choice
a
simple
word
but
oh
what
volumes
did
it
speak
there
seemed
to
be
a
very
sacredness
hanging
about
the
tone
as
time
sped
onward
leaving
far
behind
the
past
but
not
burying
it
the
sweet
was
gradually
putting
on
the
gentle
mystic
form
of
natalie
and
though
the
name
had
become
familiar
to
other
ears
to
her
its
impress
was
as
when
she
reverently
looked
upon
that
cross
of
christ
at
the
foot
of
which
was
traced
that
which
she
could
not
but
associate
therewith
the
depth
of
her
dreamy
eyes
spoke
not
only
of
him
who
had
left
them
but
they
told
of
the
soul
instinct
in
regard
to
that
which
was
as
yet
unrevealed
well
massa
i
tinks
de
sun
make
up
he
mind
to
take
a
look
out
at
us
once
more
remarked
vingo
as
seated
astride
a
he
was
making
vigorous
exertions
to
take
the
nautical
expression
from
his
young
master
boots
then
you
have
had
rather
a
dark
time
of
it
at
home
here
have
you
vingo
have
been
rather
lonely
yes
it
has
massa
harry
i
sometimes
dat
i
lose
my
entirely
and
i
tinks
you
not
find
so
much
ob
me
left
if
it
not
for
missy
bright
light
dat
shine
along
de
way
dare
not
anoder
like
her
massa
but
i
dunno
as
dat
strange
for
de
stars
not
come
down
to
bathe
in
de
ocean
ebery
day
you
are
getting
sentimental
vingo
and
an
expression
of
thought
stole
over
harry
features
and
he
remained
silent
for
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
disclose
even
to
vingo
his
knowledge
of
the
mystery
in
regard
to
the
fair
creature
who
called
him
brother
he
could
not
bear
to
think
that
she
was
not
his
sister
and
yet
had
his
memory
not
served
him
thus
he
must
have
observed
how
unlike
she
was
to
any
member
of
the
family
mother
you
have
looked
very
thoughtful
for
the
last
few
days
i
hope
that
now
we
are
together
once
more
there
is
nothing
to
disturb
your
happiness
remarked
harry
as
the
two
sat
together
on
the
little
promenade
ground
in
front
of
the
house
enjoying
the
beautiful
sunset
of
a
summer
evening
there
is
nothing
which
makes
me
unhappy
now
for
although
know
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
yet
i
have
learned
to
smile
under
the
most
trying
dispensations
of
providence
knowing
that
his
ways
are
higher
than
our
ways
but
and
her
voice
was
hushed
almost
to
a
whisper
there
has
been
something
upon
my
mind
of
late
of
which
i
would
make
you
a
confidant
my
son
there
was
a
pause
well
did
harry
judge
of
what
his
mother
would
speak
and
looking
into
her
face
he
said
natalie
she
is
not
my
sister
by
birth
yet
i
shall
ever
claim
her
as
such
and
i
know
should
she
learn
that
she
was
of
other
parentage
she
would
cling
to
you
mother
as
her
dearest
earthly
friend
and
for
that
reason
i
know
she
is
of
noble
birth
but
tell
me
harry
can
it
be
that
you
who
was
but
a
child
remember
the
circumstance
yes
mother
i
can
well
remember
the
infant
with
the
gold
bands
and
the
pretty
white
dress
all
wet
with
salt
water
then
were
my
first
ideas
of
innocency
she
has
proved
a
rich
blessing
to
us
and
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
ever
part
with
her
but
i
have
been
thinking
it
was
selfish
indeed
in
keeping
her
with
us
to
deprive
her
of
those
advantages
which
would
fit
her
for
filling
the
station
which
i
can
plainly
see
belongs
to
her
not
but
that
she
might
finish
her
education
at
home
for
our
island
can
rank
among
the
first
in
her
systems
of
education
and
there
are
many
of
our
citizens
who
are
recognized
by
our
most
literary
friends
of
the
continent
as
among
the
first
in
the
arts
and
sciences
but
i
think
it
would
be
greatly
to
her
advantage
to
see
more
of
the
world
and
my
purpose
is
to
accept
the
urgent
request
of
a
dear
friend
residing
in
boston
that
my
daughter
should
spend
some
time
in
her
family
where
she
may
receive
the
same
excellent
instructions
with
her
own
child
our
means
have
been
for
the
last
year
or
two
somewhat
curtailed
yet
as
long
as
we
have
enough
to
be
comfortable
we
will
share
with
her
what
she
most
justly
deserves
yes
mother
give
my
portion
to
her
i
can
take
care
of
myself
and
you
shall
not
want
for
anything
so
long
as
i
can
help
you
i
do
not
know
how
we
can
let
her
go
but
it
is
for
the
best
she
will
learn
of
this
world
and
they
will
learn
of
another
as
the
two
had
been
speaking
they
had
not
observed
a
light
form
reclining
under
a
flowering
currant
which
only
separated
them
from
the
object
of
their
conversation
it
was
a
little
arbor
formed
by
a
clustering
rose
vieing
with
the
flowering
currant
in
fragrance
thither
had
the
repaired
and
as
the
softest
rays
of
a
northern
sky
at
sunset
sank
into
her
soul
mingling
with
more
mellow
light
than
is
of
southern
climes
these
words
fell
upon
her
ear
natalie
she
is
not
my
sister
by
birth
she
paused
to
hear
no
more
for
she
knew
the
conversation
was
not
designed
for
her
and
noiselessly
gliding
from
the
spot
she
sought
her
own
room
the
crescent
moon
came
forth
and
beheld
the
fair
maiden
gazing
far
out
over
the
billows
her
head
resting
upon
her
hand
her
golden
tresses
falling
gracefully
over
her
shoulders
while
from
the
deep
recesses
of
her
heart
there
sprung
up
that
which
had
ever
been
and
yet
was
not
and
took
to
itself
a
form
good
morning
natalie
did
i
not
know
you
retired
early
last
night
i
should
say
you
look
a
little
unrefreshed
where
are
the
roses
of
yesterday
they
should
not
fade
in
a
single
night
roses
will
fade
mother
and
there
are
those
which
await
the
genial
rays
of
light
before
their
unfolding
replied
but
i
did
not
retire
until
quite
late
last
evening
for
everything
was
so
beautiful
and
glad
that
i
loved
to
look
out
upon
the
night
and
such
beautiful
thoughts
came
to
my
mind
that
i
think
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
and
dreamed
and
yet
i
was
awake
for
i
was
conscious
of
watching
the
water
as
it
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
as
the
waves
broke
upon
the
shore
they
seemed
to
be
striving
one
with
another
to
see
which
should
venture
the
nearest
till
at
last
there
came
one
which
lifted
its
head
high
above
the
rest
and
as
it
receded
i
saw
there
was
left
upon
the
beach
a
tiny
shining
thing
which
resembled
many
drops
of
dew
just
then
the
light
clouds
separated
and
there
looked
down
a
star
mild
and
presently
there
came
another
equally
mild
and
the
two
finally
blended
into
one
still
hovering
over
the
glittering
one
upon
the
beach
at
last
there
seemed
to
be
a
stream
of
light
connecting
one
with
the
other
i
looked
again
and
the
tiny
thing
which
was
left
of
the
waves
had
gone
to
be
with
the
brighter
one
beyond
the
clouds
presently
i
looked
again
and
there
were
the
three
but
they
were
changed
the
first
star
which
had
appeared
seemed
now
to
be
a
lovely
lady
oh
so
gentle
the
second
was
yourself
dear
mother
and
the
shining
one
which
had
gone
to
them
appeared
to
be
myself
the
gentle
lady
took
us
each
by
the
hand
and
when
i
saw
her
smile
upon
you
so
sweetly
i
began
to
weep
and
the
lady
took
me
in
her
arms
and
wiped
my
tears
away
i
was
awakened
from
my
revery
by
my
sobs
for
it
all
appeared
so
real
and
my
tears
made
me
happier
grosvenor
listened
to
her
child
with
astonishment
it
was
a
most
striking
dream
indeed
she
remarked
but
fearing
the
might
notice
her
surprise
she
drew
her
arm
about
her
and
introduced
the
subject
which
for
some
time
past
had
been
uppermost
in
her
mind
what
do
you
think
of
spending
a
little
time
away
from
home
my
dear
how
should
you
like
to
graduate
with
boston
honors
to
learn
the
customs
of
city
life
i
shall
like
it
much
if
it
is
your
wish
that
i
should
go
mother
but
i
know
no
life
will
be
pleasanter
than
the
happy
days
which
we
have
spent
here
in
our
own
quiet
home
perhaps
you
will
not
always
think
thus
you
may
find
greater
joys
in
the
attractions
which
are
before
you
yet
i
trust
my
child
your
affection
for
your
mother
will
be
no
less
whatever
your
circumstances
may
be
oh
mother
how
can
that
be
possible
do
not
repeat
the
words
how
can
it
be
that
i
shall
ever
love
you
less
no
my
child
it
will
not
be
i
wrong
you
in
speaking
such
thoughts
i
can
not
bear
to
part
with
you
even
for
a
little
time
yet
i
will
not
gratify
my
desires
at
your
loss
and
in
giving
you
to
the
care
of
my
most
estimable
friend
santon
i
shall
feel
that
you
are
under
the
influence
of
one
of
the
best
of
women
i
shall
love
her
for
your
sake
but
i
know
i
shall
miss
the
dear
ones
at
home
so
much
the
time
came
when
the
should
leave
her
home
to
learn
what
is
the
world
is
made
of
and
taking
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
family
the
red
bandana
of
vingo
being
counted
among
the
articles
of
utility
she
was
borne
lightly
over
the
billows
leaving
her
island
home
far
far
behind
chapter
viii
softly
stealing
as
the
evening
vesper
bell
and
she
was
one
on
whom
to
fix
my
heart
to
sit
beside
me
when
my
thoughts
are
sad
and
by
her
tender
playfulness
impart
some
of
her
pure
joy
to
me
percival
patience
and
hope
that
keep
the
soul
unruffled
and
serene
though
floods
of
grief
beneath
it
roll
i
learn
when
calm
and
pure
i
see
the
floating
gleam
amid
shadows
dark
and
chilly
caroline
may
the
arrived
at
her
new
home
in
safety
the
home
of
our
western
friends
the
santons
the
continued
of
santon
had
been
the
chief
cause
of
the
return
of
the
family
to
the
east
by
a
favorable
turn
of
fortune
santon
had
come
into
possession
of
nearly
double
the
amount
of
his
former
wealth
and
he
was
now
looked
upon
as
one
of
boston
most
prominent
citizens
the
selling
of
western
lands
which
he
had
obtained
for
a
mere
trifle
had
been
the
chief
source
of
revenue
in
building
up
his
fortune
the
little
winifred
whom
we
left
making
merry
over
the
erin
simplicity
of
biddy
and
patrick
had
grown
to
be
a
young
miss
of
seventeen
those
black
eyes
of
hers
which
had
attracted
the
gaze
of
the
tall
western
youths
for
the
last
time
had
in
no
way
lost
their
brilliancy
mischief
still
sat
triumphant
therein
and
not
a
day
passed
but
some
poor
uninitiated
was
brought
to
test
the
merits
of
that
gift
miss
winnie
looked
upon
this
removal
to
more
enlightened
regions
as
a
change
altogether
for
the
best
for
how
could
such
as
she
at
that
age
which
never
comes
but
once
in
a
lifetime
be
content
to
feed
on
air
la
she
had
tired
of
looking
at
the
same
gallants
and
had
come
to
the
grand
final
decision
that
her
charms
should
not
be
wasted
thus
and
now
that
she
was
surrounded
by
those
urbane
solicitors
which
do
mingle
with
those
of
more
enlargement
of
brain
in
fashionable
life
they
in
turn
began
to
fear
lest
those
charms
might
not
prove
for
such
as
them
mother
asked
winnie
a
few
days
before
the
arrival
of
the
who
is
this
friend
whom
you
have
invited
to
visit
us
that
is
i
mean
to
ask
what
is
she
like
i
have
often
heard
you
speak
of
your
early
friend
grosvenor
but
you
have
never
seen
her
daughter
and
who
knows
but
she
may
be
well
i
wont
say
but
you
know
nantucket
is
but
an
isolated
place
where
fishermen
live
and
the
society
in
which
she
has
moved
will
probably
unfit
her
for
enjoying
ours
but
she
will
be
with
us
in
a
day
or
two
so
we
shall
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
it
is
many
years
since
i
have
seen
grosvenor
we
met
when
we
were
both
young
married
ladies
at
the
house
of
a
friend
of
mine
in
new
york
where
she
was
visiting
and
i
formed
an
attachment
for
her
then
which
has
never
abated
we
have
kept
ourselves
informed
of
each
welfare
from
time
to
time
and
thinking
that
the
daughter
might
possess
the
same
amiable
disposition
as
her
mother
i
thought
that
her
presence
in
our
family
might
be
pleasant
to
us
all
besides
gaining
for
her
under
your
teachers
of
music
and
the
languages
a
finished
education
as
for
society
in
nantucket
i
have
never
learned
of
what
grade
it
is
but
judging
from
the
appearance
of
the
only
person
i
have
ever
met
from
there
i
do
not
consider
them
far
behind
the
age
well
i
hope
i
shall
like
her
i
am
sure
she
has
a
sweet
name
natalie
perhaps
we
shall
like
her
after
all
but
nantucket
brought
to
my
mind
such
visions
of
unrefined
oil
that
i
really
began
to
tremble
lest
we
might
come
in
closer
contact
therewith
than
would
be
at
all
agreeable
santon
received
the
with
a
mother
tenderness
but
being
weary
with
her
journey
natalie
retired
early
to
dream
of
those
far
low
murmurings
of
the
deep
which
she
had
so
missed
in
lulling
her
to
rest
i
am
so
disappointed
in
her
mother
she
is
such
a
gentle
delicate
creature
i
know
i
shall
love
her
and
such
spiritual
eyes
did
you
notice
when
you
asked
about
her
mother
what
a
sweet
expression
she
wore
she
is
a
beautiful
creature
and
if
i
mistake
not
she
has
a
heart
to
match
but
she
does
not
resemble
her
mother
at
all
in
features
i
think
captain
grosvenor
must
have
been
a
man
and
santon
wore
a
complacent
look
as
she
thought
of
the
favorable
effect
which
their
guest
might
have
upon
the
mind
of
her
daughter
for
owing
to
frequent
santon
had
not
been
able
to
be
with
her
child
as
much
as
she
would
have
desired
and
she
feared
lest
those
early
traits
in
her
character
of
impatience
and
a
proneness
to
censure
others
might
grow
upon
her
under
the
influence
of
her
father
who
was
blind
to
her
every
fault
ah
ha
miss
puss
said
santon
who
had
received
a
most
favorable
impression
of
the
you
will
have
to
look
out
for
that
creature
or
even
your
bewitching
charms
will
be
cast
in
the
shade
and
as
he
spoke
he
proudly
surveyed
his
idolized
daughter
who
was
indeed
to
be
classed
among
the
first
in
the
brunette
style
of
beauty
oh
never
fear
for
me
father
replied
winnie
taking
a
satisfied
survey
of
her
figure
reflected
in
a
if
boston
forgets
winnie
santon
black
eyes
she
will
be
perfectly
resigned
in
gazing
into
the
orbs
which
shall
usurp
her
power
other
days
than
those
which
had
been
spent
in
sweet
seclusion
on
nantucket
peaceful
shores
now
dawned
upon
the
although
not
a
day
passed
in
which
she
did
not
sigh
for
one
dear
familiar
tone
from
those
she
loved
so
well
for
her
mother
fond
embrace
and
the
free
glad
laugh
of
brother
harry
yet
she
was
happy
excelling
in
those
pursuits
which
seemed
to
recognize
her
touch
and
her
soft
voice
as
it
were
of
italian
origin
grew
to
be
the
sunshine
of
the
house
as
biddy
often
declared
it
was
a
great
saving
of
canary
seed
to
have
miss
natalie
about
the
house
time
glided
on
apace
with
the
as
each
day
brought
some
new
task
calling
into
activity
some
talent
which
had
been
lying
in
a
dormant
state
awaiting
its
time
for
expanding
her
teacher
of
music
an
italian
by
birth
and
of
great
fame
in
his
profession
was
in
raptures
with
the
progress
of
his
two
pupils
and
in
the
extraordinary
talent
displayed
by
the
was
he
perfectly
amazed
for
not
only
was
her
voice
of
that
soft
mellow
style
peculiar
to
the
italian
people
but
she
performed
those
pieces
which
had
but
just
been
introduced
to
an
american
ear
with
all
that
impassioned
tenderness
peculiar
to
that
nation
i
believe
you
be
one
of
my
people
exclaimed
the
signor
after
listening
in
breathless
attention
to
a
new
piece
which
he
had
brought
for
her
her
echoing
tones
died
away
and
rose
again
with
gentler
pathos
softly
and
with
sweeter
tone
to
fall
again
unconsciously
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
signor
as
he
spoke
and
her
thoughts
were
carried
back
far
away
she
knew
not
whither
they
would
take
her
but
rousing
from
her
reverie
she
merely
replied
i
love
the
peculiar
air
of
your
nation
it
presents
such
a
striking
contrast
to
our
cold
less
pathetic
style
but
do
not
exclude
what
winnie
terms
productions
of
the
genii
more
sensible
moments
from
my
list
of
favorites
for
as
there
are
hours
which
are
divided
into
sixty
distinct
parts
so
there
are
divisions
within
the
human
heart
which
must
live
each
upon
its
own
native
air
natalie
darling
what
were
you
talking
with
the
signor
about
from
the
few
words
which
i
caught
of
the
human
heart
i
did
not
know
but
the
presence
of
a
third
person
might
be
agreeably
dispensed
with
and
it
was
overtaxing
the
fringed
lids
of
the
mischievous
winnie
eyes
in
adding
to
their
duties
the
office
of
sentinel
ah
you
rogue
have
your
critic
ears
been
listening
to
my
feeble
endeavors
to
repay
the
signor
for
his
untiring
labors
one
can
hear
your
music
without
listening
for
i
was
deep
in
thought
of
the
time
when
i
shall
come
out
from
under
the
tyrannical
power
of
instructors
and
can
do
as
i
like
for
my
part
i
am
tired
to
death
of
this
continual
winifred
this
piece
must
be
executed
with
milder
intonations
or
winifred
that
chapter
of
spanish
must
be
told
with
greater
fluency
i
have
come
to
dread
the
very
name
of
professor
and
i
never
can
look
out
of
the
window
but
i
see
some
gentleman
of
the
profession
approaching
with
his
badge
under
his
arm
but
those
edifying
ideas
all
vanished
at
the
first
strain
of
your
diva
if
i
could
produce
such
an
effect
what
would
i
not
give
and
the
beauty
drew
her
arm
around
the
and
spoke
in
a
lower
tone
natalie
you
know
i
shall
come
out
on
my
eighteenth
birthday
and
that
will
be
in
a
very
short
time
then
i
can
do
as
i
like
but
how
can
i
let
all
of
these
charming
performances
of
the
celebrated
madam
forresti
whose
name
is
in
every
mouth
pass
without
hearing
her
i
must
say
i
was
completely
nonplussed
when
young
montague
asked
me
this
morning
what
i
thought
of
her
and
when
i
told
him
i
had
not
heard
her
as
yet
he
was
perfectly
astonished
and
said
i
must
hear
her
this
very
night
but
you
did
not
accept
of
his
invitation
winnie
how
could
i
resist
such
a
temptation
i
have
been
longing
to
hear
madam
forresti
and
with
montague
for
an
escort
i
do
not
see
the
least
impropriety
in
attending
i
need
not
trouble
mother
about
it
for
she
is
so
nervous
she
will
not
leave
her
room
and
i
do
not
think
she
can
object
to
my
going
oh
winnie
how
could
you
do
so
i
know
your
mother
would
not
wish
you
to
appear
in
public
with
montague
not
but
that
he
may
be
worthy
of
attention
but
he
is
the
same
as
a
stranger
to
us
for
your
father
has
known
him
but
a
little
while
and
i
noticed
that
your
mother
appeared
uneasy
when
he
called
last
for
he
has
made
us
frequent
visits
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
you
do
not
surely
suppose
that
my
father
would
introduce
any
one
into
his
family
who
is
not
a
fit
associate
for
his
daughter
retorted
winnie
her
face
flushing
with
excitement
no
i
do
not
think
so
but
you
would
not
go
without
consulting
your
mother
wishes
and
why
not
mother
will
never
be
the
wiser
for
it
and
i
can
not
see
that
she
can
reasonably
object
besides
am
i
always
to
be
a
child
i
must
some
time
or
other
act
for
myself
dear
winnie
do
not
talk
so
you
have
one
of
the
best
of
mothers
and
she
will
not
deprive
you
of
any
pleasure
unless
it
is
for
your
own
good
but
do
not
be
displeased
with
me
for
speaking
my
thoughts
for
i
love
you
as
a
sister
and
can
not
bear
to
have
you
do
anything
that
would
not
be
right
winnie
was
about
to
give
way
to
those
passions
which
an
indulged
child
invariably
possesses
and
being
naturally
of
a
very
sensitive
nature
she
could
not
sit
easy
under
those
opinions
from
others
which
were
in
opposition
to
her
own
views
and
trembling
with
rage
she
turned
to
the
but
the
fire
of
her
eye
was
subdued
her
tongue
did
not
give
utterance
to
the
bitter
cruel
words
which
would
have
sounded
so
strangely
upon
an
ear
that
had
never
known
such
tones
she
gave
one
look
at
the
gentle
submissive
face
of
the
and
burst
into
tears
tears
from
the
winnie
santon
was
a
strange
sight
her
proud
rebellious
spirit
had
for
once
been
conquered
and
what
was
not
such
a
lesson
worth
o
natalie
she
exclaimed
how
i
wish
i
could
be
like
you
i
was
just
upon
the
point
of
saying
what
i
know
i
should
have
repented
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
to
be
with
us
nothing
more
was
said
about
going
to
hear
madame
forresti
but
when
evening
came
winnie
after
leaving
a
message
with
biddy
for
montague
that
she
must
be
excused
sought
her
mother
room
where
she
found
who
was
reading
to
the
invalid
and
the
rich
tones
of
her
voice
conveyed
far
more
happiness
to
her
heart
than
would
have
been
hers
had
she
listened
to
the
songstress
with
a
conscience
speaking
of
undutifulness
natalie
was
reading
from
the
hope
and
as
she
read
ever
and
anon
cast
her
eye
toward
winnie
who
appeared
unusually
thoughtful
the
nervous
state
however
of
santon
would
admit
of
but
little
excitement
and
as
natalie
closed
her
book
and
rose
to
bid
her
she
observed
that
she
looked
unusually
happy
and
taking
her
dear
children
by
the
hand
she
thanked
them
tenderly
for
their
devoted
attention
to
her
and
drawing
close
to
winnie
she
whispered
in
her
ear
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
me
dear
that
you
prefer
your
mother
sick
room
to
more
attractive
society
had
she
known
of
the
struggle
which
had
been
going
on
in
her
heart
through
the
influence
of
the
gentle
one
whom
she
looked
upon
as
a
child
her
eye
could
hardly
have
been
brighter
than
it
was
as
her
child
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
forehead
and
said
i
shall
always
love
best
to
be
with
you
mother
that
night
winnie
retired
with
a
determination
to
strive
to
overcome
her
sinful
ways
and
as
she
heard
the
voice
of
the
at
her
evening
devotions
their
rooms
adjoining
she
spoke
aloud
i
will
try
to
be
more
like
her
with
this
resolve
she
fell
asleep
but
as
the
rising
sun
peeped
in
at
her
window
there
were
to
be
found
no
traces
of
her
evening
resolutions
if
any
thing
mischief
looked
out
upon
the
new
day
with
renewed
earnestness
and
winnie
santon
was
the
same
gay
reckless
creature
as
ever
ah
ha
miss
puss
so
your
bow
is
new
strung
again
is
it
said
santon
to
his
daughter
as
the
door
closed
upon
one
of
the
mustached
upper
ten
who
frequently
found
their
way
to
the
elegant
mansion
of
santon
strung
with
an
old
string
father
if
these
exquisites
are
foolish
enough
to
burn
their
fingers
a
second
time
they
must
suffer
the
consequences
santon
laughed
and
merely
said
oh
you
cruel
beauty
returning
to
his
paper
again
but
seated
in
the
was
one
who
could
not
thus
lightly
look
upon
the
conduct
of
the
coquettish
winnie
for
it
was
evident
she
was
a
sad
coquette
often
had
natalie
observed
her
as
she
received
each
admirer
with
the
same
bewitching
smile
impressing
him
with
the
belief
that
he
of
all
others
was
the
favored
one
and
he
would
depart
to
return
again
as
early
as
the
rules
of
propriety
would
admit
considering
the
fair
one
was
not
yet
out
natalie
asked
winnie
as
she
seated
herself
at
her
embroidery
why
did
you
not
deign
to
give
redfield
one
of
your
winning
smiles
you
are
so
reserved
and
take
so
little
notice
of
the
gentlemen
that
i
shall
begin
to
think
your
charms
are
doomed
to
fade
beneath
the
convent
veil
i
was
not
aware
that
i
did
not
receive
redfield
with
cordiality
yes
but
the
absence
of
that
fascinating
air
which
you
know
would
bring
the
most
unyielding
to
your
feet
is
what
i
am
lamenting
had
redfield
been
my
only
admirer
i
should
have
been
jealous
of
the
glances
which
he
cast
at
you
but
i
do
know
as
there
would
be
any
occasion
for
that
for
you
whose
heart
is
made
for
love
seem
to
be
in
no
danger
at
present
of
losing
it
i
certainly
respect
the
gentlemen
who
visit
us
but
as
for
having
a
preference
for
one
more
than
another
i
have
not
and
winnie
dear
just
ask
yourself
if
you
ever
give
one
thought
to
any
one
of
those
who
deceive
themselves
by
thinking
that
they
of
all
others
are
preeminent
in
your
regards
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
do
not
give
them
a
thought
after
the
door
once
closes
upon
them
poor
deluded
creatures
but
do
you
think
it
right
to
deceive
them
thus
natie
darling
if
you
were
not
the
most
romantic
creature
that
ever
was
i
should
call
you
miss
but
really
i
do
know
as
there
is
anything
very
criminal
in
helping
such
people
to
open
their
eyes
they
find
out
sooner
or
later
that
i
am
of
the
opinion
there
are
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
was
caught
the
said
no
more
for
she
feared
her
words
might
be
worse
than
useless
but
such
are
never
idle
words
and
though
winnie
appeared
to
give
them
little
heed
yet
many
times
afterward
in
the
midst
of
her
gaiety
did
she
remember
the
question
is
it
right
to
deceive
thus
eighteen
years
old
mother
just
eighteen
shouted
winnie
as
she
came
into
the
breakfast
room
her
cheeks
vieing
with
the
red
of
the
rose
how
happy
i
am
and
casting
a
look
of
contempt
at
the
hot
rolls
and
coffee
as
if
such
things
were
hereafter
to
be
classed
among
the
necessities
of
the
past
she
went
bounding
away
to
find
her
father
opening
the
door
of
the
she
paused
arranged
upon
the
table
were
her
birthday
gifts
and
santon
had
spared
no
pains
to
make
the
collection
as
rare
as
possible
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
a
set
of
diamonds
for
the
hair
and
as
winnie
clasped
them
about
her
dark
tresses
she
laughed
outright
exclaiming
they
are
so
handsome
papa
i
can
not
wait
for
night
to
come
but
what
is
this
she
asked
drawing
from
a
case
a
string
of
pearls
and
holding
them
up
to
the
light
in
the
centre
of
the
collection
was
one
curiously
wrought
pearl
so
formed
as
to
represent
a
star
and
the
sparkling
of
several
diamonds
from
within
produced
a
very
brilliant
effect
examining
it
closely
she
discovered
the
initials
wrought
upon
the
setting
it
is
for
you
natalie
she
exclaimed
to
the
who
stood
enjoying
winnie
delight
i
thank
you
father
for
remembering
dear
natalie
is
it
for
me
asked
natalie
hesitating
to
receive
the
gift
yes
take
it
said
santon
putting
the
treasure
into
her
hand
keep
it
as
a
memento
of
our
high
esteem
for
you
and
added
he
i
for
one
shall
petition
after
you
have
finished
your
studies
to
have
you
remain
with
us
another
season
that
we
may
then
have
more
of
your
society
natalie
expressed
her
sincere
thanks
but
the
mention
of
remaining
another
season
brought
to
her
remembrance
her
mother
last
letter
which
spoke
of
her
return
and
how
delighted
they
would
all
be
to
have
her
in
their
little
home
once
more
the
long
time
when
winnie
should
appear
in
public
as
the
accomplished
miss
santon
at
length
arrived
several
hundred
cards
had
been
issued
for
the
occasion
and
to
winnie
delight
but
few
regrets
had
been
received
for
said
she
what
is
the
use
of
doing
things
by
the
halves
santon
health
had
for
the
last
few
days
been
much
improved
so
much
so
that
winnie
had
gained
from
her
the
promise
to
fill
her
station
for
a
part
of
the
evening
the
brilliant
lights
already
streamed
from
every
window
in
the
mansion
and
the
finishing
touch
if
such
a
thing
can
be
said
of
a
lady
toilet
had
been
made
by
attendant
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
for
although
the
beauty
was
willing
to
submit
to
all
the
tortures
of
yet
before
she
was
quite
converted
into
a
parisian
belle
she
positively
declared
she
would
suffer
none
of
those
officials
to
come
into
her
presence
again
for
a
month
surveying
herself
with
an
air
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
queen
she
proceeded
to
the
apartments
thinking
to
banter
her
a
little
in
her
endeavors
to
make
perfection
perfect
but
instead
of
finding
her
still
in
dishabille
she
had
long
ago
dismissed
her
attendant
and
was
quietly
engaged
in
reading
her
bible
before
she
engaged
in
those
scenes
of
gaiety
which
had
less
attractions
for
her
why
you
charming
creature
exclaimed
winnie
i
ca
help
comparing
you
to
a
fairy
preparing
for
a
and
her
wild
laugh
was
heard
reechoing
from
hall
to
hall
natalie
smiling
at
her
ludicrous
comparison
why
do
you
look
at
me
with
such
a
bewildered
gaze
winnie
is
my
simple
dress
not
to
your
fastidious
taste
you
could
not
have
found
anything
more
becoming
natie
dear
you
will
eclipse
us
all
and
winnie
taking
both
her
hands
in
hers
gazed
into
her
face
as
if
i
have
seen
some
beautiful
picture
somewhere
she
exclaimed
which
is
like
you
but
where
i
can
not
tell
and
yet
when
i
look
at
you
the
association
is
so
fresh
in
my
mind
yes
you
will
be
our
evening
star
venus
is
morning
star
now
said
natalie
glancing
at
the
brilliant
dress
of
winnie
yet
for
all
that
she
will
favor
us
with
her
presence
this
evening
as
the
two
descended
to
the
boudoir
they
were
met
by
santon
who
shutting
his
eyes
exclaimed
bless
me
i
have
looked
upon
the
glorious
morning
in
the
beauty
of
its
freshness
and
the
gentle
evening
so
pure
but
to
see
them
approaching
hand
in
hand
is
too
much
for
any
man
escorting
the
fair
ones
to
santon
side
he
proudly
gazed
upon
their
dazzling
beauty
beauty
in
its
perfection
sitting
upon
each
countenance
and
yet
such
a
contrast
winnie
was
arrayed
in
a
rich
attire
of
delicate
blue
her
boddice
wrought
about
with
silver
threads
representing
the
light
of
the
crescent
moon
her
skirt
interwoven
with
numerous
lesser
lights
as
it
were
stars
of
various
magnitudes
producing
a
splendid
effect
in
the
flood
of
and
the
set
of
diamonds
bound
about
her
dark
tresses
which
fell
in
rich
profusion
about
her
finely
arched
neck
setting
off
her
dark
complexion
her
cheeks
roseate
with
health
to
great
advantage
and
as
she
moved
among
her
guests
her
tall
slender
form
so
full
of
dignity
she
was
the
observed
of
all
observers
her
winning
smile
so
dangerous
to
those
gallants
in
attendance
who
had
never
realized
the
true
sense
of
coquetry
was
unusually
fascinating
and
every
one
who
had
been
honored
by
miss
winnie
notice
pronounced
her
decidedly
the
belle
of
the
season
but
as
they
turned
to
the
gentle
creature
at
her
side
their
thoughts
gradually
assumed
a
different
cast
unconsciously
the
mind
wandered
to
other
scenes
than
are
usually
of
a
fashionable
evening
entertainment
it
were
absurd
to
call
her
a
belle
for
the
word
seemed
void
of
expression
the
wore
a
simple
dress
of
white
blonde
with
no
other
ornament
than
the
band
of
pearls
which
had
been
the
gift
of
her
friends
the
little
star
which
was
formed
by
the
glittering
of
the
diamonds
through
the
pearl
which
being
the
centre
of
the
collection
was
worn
upon
her
forehead
sparkling
like
tiny
drops
of
dew
and
as
she
glided
with
unstudied
grace
among
those
who
sought
to
know
more
of
her
she
gained
the
name
of
the
gentle
star
it
was
yet
early
in
the
evening
sauntering
along
one
of
the
principal
streets
were
two
young
men
engaged
in
conversation
we
will
listen
awhile
for
we
may
be
interested
do
you
go
to
santon
delwood
asked
the
younger
of
the
two
who
was
far
less
prepossessing
in
appearance
than
his
companion
umph
yes
replied
the
other
in
a
more
reserved
tone
do
you
make
one
of
the
number
you
do
know
dick
montague
if
you
think
he
would
miss
of
such
an
occasion
wit
and
beauty
do
not
hold
forth
every
night
old
santon
has
but
one
daughter
you
know
delwood
made
no
reply
to
these
coarse
remarks
for
nothing
could
have
been
in
greater
contrast
than
the
refined
gentlemanly
nature
of
delwood
to
that
of
young
montague
whom
we
recognize
as
the
same
gentleman
if
such
young
men
who
wear
two
faces
putting
aside
the
decorum
of
intelligent
society
for
the
rude
jests
and
unrefined
manners
of
other
associates
can
be
called
gentlemen
who
had
attracted
santon
notice
by
his
frequent
visits
to
her
daughter
before
proceeding
farther
we
will
give
our
patient
reader
a
little
insight
to
the
history
of
these
two
personages
whom
we
consider
of
sufficient
note
in
our
simple
narrative
for
inducing
us
to
tear
ourselves
away
for
a
little
while
from
the
attractions
at
santon
mansion
clarence
delwood
belonged
to
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
families
in
boston
he
was
an
only
son
upon
whom
had
been
bestowed
all
of
those
advantages
which
are
to
be
derived
from
a
princely
fortune
at
the
early
age
of
he
had
graduated
at
one
of
the
first
institutions
in
paris
where
he
had
been
placed
by
his
haughty
overbearing
father
who
looked
upon
things
american
as
low
and
vulgar
the
son
had
not
inherited
that
proud
unyielding
spirit
of
his
father
yet
he
was
like
him
inasmuch
as
he
possessed
the
same
dignified
reserved
manner
the
which
having
called
forth
the
startling
declaration
from
manoeuvering
mothers
and
languishing
daughters
that
clarence
delwood
would
look
farther
than
boston
for
a
bride
so
they
had
folded
their
gossamer
wings
with
resignation
receiving
his
polite
attentions
with
pleasure
yet
never
being
able
to
penetrate
the
reserve
which
hung
around
him
to
say
that
our
hero
was
handsome
would
be
saying
but
little
for
one
often
meets
with
such
but
with
the
almost
feminine
pensiveness
which
characterized
his
manly
features
we
meet
seldom
tall
and
commanding
in
his
appearance
his
dark
glossy
hair
and
finely
curved
mustache
gave
a
fine
effect
to
his
noble
countenance
the
peculiar
light
of
his
eye
speaking
volumes
such
was
the
character
of
our
friend
delwood
whom
we
shall
shortly
usher
into
the
presence
of
miss
winnie
santon
that
we
may
find
what
success
those
penetrating
eyes
which
grew
big
with
mischief
even
in
a
prairie
home
shall
have
in
lifting
the
veil
which
concealed
in
a
measure
the
true
sentiments
of
a
noble
heart
from
the
world
at
large
we
give
our
readers
an
insight
to
the
character
of
richard
montague
at
once
when
we
say
that
he
was
what
is
commonly
termed
a
young
man
about
town
by
some
means
a
mystery
even
to
himself
he
had
gained
a
foothold
among
the
upper
classes
of
society
and
by
dint
of
strict
observance
of
the
manners
of
others
he
had
been
thus
far
enabled
to
retain
his
position
what
his
prospects
in
regard
to
pecuniary
affairs
were
no
one
was
able
to
say
suffice
it
that
there
had
been
rumors
of
an
old
bachelor
uncle
who
was
much
increased
in
this
world
goods
whose
trembling
hand
held
the
desired
treasure
over
the
young
head
and
as
this
report
had
not
been
corrected
by
montague
he
not
being
with
many
scruples
of
conscience
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
should
have
been
those
who
looked
upon
him
as
a
desirable
match
for
their
dowerless
daughters
but
he
having
realized
the
desolation
which
empty
pockets
can
produce
was
now
living
upon
the
hope
that
he
might
build
upon
his
fortune
which
never
had
foundation
by
introducing
himself
among
the
fair
ones
of
uppertendom
as
a
candidate
for
matrimony
for
some
time
he
had
had
an
eye
to
the
purse
of
winnie
santon
and
he
had
looked
forward
to
this
night
when
she
should
make
her
with
as
great
interest
as
had
winnie
herself
could
he
once
get
initiated
into
her
good
graces
he
had
no
fears
for
the
rest
and
he
had
already
visions
of
what
he
was
pleased
to
term
old
santon
chest
of
gold
the
attentions
with
which
winnie
had
received
him
on
former
occasions
had
served
in
no
way
to
lessen
his
confidence
as
to
his
success
and
with
this
end
in
view
his
steps
were
bent
towards
the
scene
of
gaiety
reasons
best
known
to
himself
forbidding
him
to
pass
delwood
whom
he
overtook
on
the
way
quite
an
affair
i
thinking
remarked
montague
as
he
observed
delwood
cool
indifference
and
endeavoring
to
draw
him
into
conversation
he
added
there
a
young
of
santon
staying
with
his
daughter
who
i
hear
hails
from
down
east
nantucket
i
believe
perhaps
we
may
get
a
little
information
on
harpooning
ah
said
delwood
mechanically
yes
the
boys
will
have
some
sport
i
thinking
perhaps
some
of
them
may
be
induced
to
ship
as
mate
for
a
down
east
voyage
i
remember
of
sailing
by
nantucket
many
years
ago
on
my
return
from
liverpool
he
did
not
add
that
he
had
worked
his
passage
and
though
some
twenty
miles
distant
we
fancied
that
we
got
a
whiff
of
the
our
captain
was
a
jolly
sort
of
fellow
and
would
have
us
believe
that
his
experienced
eye
could
see
half
across
the
ocean
but
he
found
we
were
too
smart
for
him
when
he
told
us
he
could
see
a
looming
up
on
the
island
for
of
course
we
knew
that
such
things
were
not
raised
there
much
to
delwood
relief
they
had
now
arrived
at
residence
as
the
name
of
delwood
was
announced
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
him
for
his
presence
was
considered
a
great
acquisition
to
any
circle
and
many
a
fair
one
envied
winnie
santon
as
he
claimed
her
hand
for
the
first
dance
the
stood
by
santon
side
that
she
might
attend
to
her
least
wish
when
young
montague
disappointed
that
he
had
not
been
the
first
to
secure
the
hand
of
winnie
in
an
obsequious
manner
solicited
the
pleasure
of
miss
grosvenor
company
to
complete
the
set
but
she
politely
declining
the
honor
the
young
man
by
the
aid
of
the
brass
which
constituted
no
small
portion
of
his
composition
begged
leave
to
remain
by
her
side
that
he
might
make
some
few
inquiries
in
regard
to
her
enchanting
home
which
place
he
always
had
a
great
desire
to
visit
the
islanders
i
suppose
are
mostly
fishermen
yet
added
he
glancing
rudely
into
her
face
there
are
some
persons
of
intelligence
among
them
are
there
not
natalie
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
whether
ignorance
or
some
meaner
motive
had
prompted
the
question
when
she
remarked
you
evidently
have
never
learned
of
the
great
dangers
attendant
upon
a
stranger
visit
to
nantucket
ah
indeed
i
shall
be
under
great
obligations
for
the
information
said
he
his
eyes
wide
open
with
curiosity
pray
what
are
those
dangers
the
islanders
as
you
have
imagined
being
so
unlike
the
inhabitants
of
civilized
lands
have
such
a
natural
propensity
for
wielding
the
harpoon
that
should
a
person
differing
from
their
kind
appear
amongst
them
they
might
be
liable
to
capture
him
mistaking
the
object
for
a
new
species
of
at
this
piece
of
information
delivered
in
such
a
calm
pleasant
manner
the
smiles
which
had
been
visible
on
the
faces
of
those
who
listened
grew
into
a
hearty
laugh
in
which
the
chagrined
montague
joined
as
being
the
safest
way
of
retreat
and
although
piqued
by
the
ludicrous
position
in
which
he
had
been
placed
he
could
not
but
look
with
admiration
upon
the
gentle
creature
whose
pleasant
repartee
had
been
in
natalie
followed
with
her
eye
the
graceful
form
of
winnie
as
she
threaded
her
way
through
the
dance
occasionally
interchanging
a
witty
remark
with
her
handsome
partner
and
as
he
lead
her
to
a
seat
natalie
observed
to
santon
how
beautiful
dear
winnie
is
i
do
not
know
who
can
help
loving
her
so
enthusiastic
was
she
in
her
praises
that
she
had
not
observed
the
two
contemplating
her
and
ere
she
was
aware
of
their
approach
the
bewitching
winnie
had
taken
her
hand
and
presenting
delwood
she
mischievously
remarked
now
miss
critic
it
is
for
you
to
perform
la
and
depend
upon
it
you
shall
be
dealt
with
according
to
your
own
measure
for
you
have
not
once
taken
those
eyes
off
from
me
through
the
whole
course
before
natalie
could
say
a
word
in
her
defence
the
music
had
commenced
and
ere
she
had
hardly
realized
it
she
had
taken
winnie
place
by
the
side
of
delwood
other
eyes
than
natalie
had
looked
upon
winnie
with
admiration
as
she
had
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
delwood
but
now
as
he
led
forth
the
gentle
star
the
suppressed
murmur
of
applause
must
have
been
apparent
to
the
fair
one
herself
had
she
not
been
engaged
with
other
thoughts
for
several
successive
figures
it
so
happened
that
natalie
was
the
partner
of
the
reserved
delwood
who
never
was
known
to
appear
a
second
time
upon
the
floor
and
it
also
happened
how
or
at
what
moment
was
a
mystery
that
the
two
had
sought
to
dispel
fatigue
by
the
conservatory
soothing
influences
whither
the
eye
of
winnie
wandered
ever
and
anon
as
with
montague
she
vied
with
her
competitors
in
the
giddy
waltz
miss
winnie
brain
was
capable
of
containing
two
thoughts
at
the
same
time
and
no
one
would
have
suspected
absorbed
as
she
appeared
to
be
with
the
attentions
of
montague
who
was
playing
the
agreeable
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
that
her
curiosity
was
at
work
wondering
what
the
subject
of
the
truants
might
be
they
are
discussing
the
rare
exotics
sent
to
us
from
the
south
she
thought
within
herself
and
indeed
what
other
could
interest
the
delwood
who
it
was
thought
had
never
dreamed
of
love
this
side
of
the
atlantic
and
as
for
natalie
many
a
private
lecture
had
she
received
from
winnie
in
regard
to
her
indifference
toward
the
gentleman
though
those
discourses
had
been
invariably
of
the
same
termination
for
all
that
natalie
your
heart
is
made
for
love
from
the
first
moment
that
clarence
delwood
had
set
his
eye
upon
the
an
interest
which
he
had
never
known
before
had
been
awakened
within
him
it
may
be
said
that
it
was
a
weakness
that
he
had
always
looked
upon
women
as
mere
butterflies
but
owing
to
early
circumstances
he
having
been
bereft
of
his
mother
in
infancy
never
having
known
the
blessings
of
a
sister
society
he
was
not
to
be
condemned
for
the
impressions
which
a
gaudily
attired
attendant
had
left
upon
his
mind
as
he
grew
up
into
boyhood
but
as
he
listened
to
the
as
she
told
him
of
her
home
in
the
sea
of
the
music
of
the
glorious
billows
companions
of
her
childhood
filling
the
very
soul
with
nature
beauty
and
sublimity
he
looked
upon
her
as
if
fearful
she
might
prove
an
undine
and
he
would
not
have
been
taken
by
surprise
had
her
spiritual
face
faded
calmly
from
beneath
his
gaze
to
join
her
sister
nymphs
of
ocean
and
you
will
soon
return
to
your
island
home
he
asked
as
a
thought
of
the
warmth
with
which
she
had
expressed
herself
to
a
stranger
bade
her
pause
in
her
enthusiasm
with
downcast
eye
yes
i
shall
soon
return
she
answered
joyously
and
yet
i
shall
remember
boston
with
feelings
of
pleasure
for
i
have
spent
happy
hours
here
as
she
said
this
their
eyes
involuntarily
met
a
silent
spectator
would
have
noted
the
contrast
of
the
moistened
blue
to
the
deep
black
of
sterner
make
but
as
it
was
that
contrast
was
not
discovered
each
felt
that
the
other
was
reading
the
thought
which
had
but
then
sprung
up
within
the
soul
natalie
withdrew
her
gaze
while
delwood
stooping
to
pluck
a
moss
from
an
urn
at
her
feet
placed
it
within
his
diamond
fastener
and
the
two
retraced
their
steps
to
join
their
friends
again
montague
was
still
at
winnie
side
and
though
the
unusual
flush
upon
natalie
cheek
was
a
sad
of
the
state
of
affairs
yet
she
observed
winnie
as
she
listened
with
a
ready
ear
to
remarks
and
an
unpleasant
feeling
rose
in
her
heart
she
could
not
bear
to
have
her
dear
friend
on
such
intimate
terms
with
him
whom
as
by
a
natural
instinct
she
shunned
all
things
must
have
an
end
and
the
cheerful
lights
which
houseless
ones
had
watched
as
the
bright
beams
fell
across
the
pave
one
by
one
had
faded
formal
adieus
had
been
said
kind
wishes
interchanged
and
the
last
sound
of
rumbling
wheels
had
died
away
excess
of
excitement
bade
the
blooming
winnie
seek
repose
and
quiet
reigned
triumphant
at
santon
mansion
yet
there
was
one
who
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
the
morning
follows
so
close
upon
the
evening
the
had
lingered
among
the
last
to
say
adieu
and
now
in
her
own
apartment
she
had
sunk
into
a
chair
the
delicate
pearls
still
encircling
her
sunny
tresses
vieing
in
purity
with
her
fair
complexion
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
vacancy
and
she
was
not
aware
that
the
morning
was
peeping
in
upon
her
till
started
from
her
reveries
by
her
own
gentle
sighs
and
what
spell
is
this
that
so
usurps
the
calm
usually
characteristic
of
her
nature
we
have
a
vague
suspicion
as
to
what
it
may
be
yet
she
is
all
innocent
of
the
source
from
which
these
new
feelings
have
sprung
even
the
last
low
words
of
delwood
which
are
still
sounding
in
her
ear
do
not
lead
her
to
mistrust
and
we
leave
her
as
the
fringed
eyelids
at
last
droop
in
repose
to
take
a
peep
at
our
hero
who
is
only
distant
a
few
squares
from
the
gentle
one
who
he
feels
as
he
sits
by
the
made
pallid
by
the
dawn
of
day
is
all
the
world
to
him
if
delwood
possessed
the
cold
heart
of
which
the
world
gave
him
the
credit
its
fetters
had
at
last
yielded
to
the
genial
sunshine
sleep
was
most
remote
from
him
and
pacing
his
room
with
a
quick
tread
he
uttered
in
a
sarcastic
tone
love
clarence
delwood
in
love
love
at
first
sight
i
never
would
have
credited
it
his
voice
softening
he
added
i
feel
confident
that
she
of
all
others
is
the
only
one
who
could
have
wrought
this
change
no
i
can
not
look
upon
this
as
weakness
i
must
see
more
of
her
she
is
an
angel
of
purity
too
good
for
such
as
i
can
she
think
favorably
of
me
and
what
will
my
father
say
if
he
learns
that
his
only
son
will
sue
for
favor
in
the
eyes
of
it
may
be
a
maiden
of
low
birth
it
matters
not
should
he
disinherit
me
i
will
seek
her
society
i
must
love
her
even
though
she
look
upon
me
coldly
i
will
see
her
again
this
very
day
with
these
resolves
he
threw
himself
upon
his
couch
if
he
might
get
a
little
rest
before
he
again
went
forth
into
the
busy
day
with
feelings
how
changed
natalie
was
awakened
from
her
late
slumbers
by
a
kiss
from
winnie
whose
merry
voice
made
the
apartment
ring
so
ho
miss
natalie
she
exclaimed
you
have
been
holding
late
revels
with
the
water
nymphs
by
moonlight
and
now
when
the
stronger
light
of
the
sun
bids
us
mortals
awake
you
have
made
good
your
retreat
and
are
enjoying
protecting
care
but
i
can
guess
from
whence
the
smiles
came
as
you
slept
never
fear
darling
i
tell
nobody
of
whom
you
dreamed
why
winnie
dear
exclaimed
natalie
endeavoring
to
free
herself
from
the
kisses
which
that
crazy
little
body
was
lavishing
upon
her
have
i
slept
so
late
and
what
has
turned
your
head
so
early
this
morning
i
do
not
know
what
will
become
of
us
all
before
the
day
is
ended
if
you
go
on
thus
opening
her
eyes
she
looked
about
her
endeavoring
to
collect
her
senses
her
eye
fell
upon
a
bouquet
of
the
finest
most
delicate
flowers
in
a
vase
upon
her
toilet
table
it
had
evidently
been
placed
there
since
she
had
retired
as
she
did
not
remember
of
seeing
it
before
you
are
very
kind
winnie
in
being
so
thoughtful
of
me
she
said
but
where
did
you
get
those
beautiful
varieties
they
are
not
from
our
conservatory
o
you
innocent
rogue
you
think
to
make
me
believe
you
know
nothing
of
them
do
you
they
certainly
came
from
some
one
who
was
thoughtful
of
your
but
come
make
yourself
look
as
charming
as
possible
for
there
is
a
friend
awaiting
us
in
the
drawing
room
who
it
is
not
say
for
makes
waste
you
know
natalie
blushed
for
there
came
at
once
a
rush
of
thoughts
to
her
mind
she
but
then
remembered
the
pleasures
of
last
evening
winnie
giving
her
a
knowing
look
left
her
to
her
own
reflections
banishing
all
other
thoughts
from
her
mind
natalie
kneeled
at
her
morning
devotions
her
low
voice
went
up
in
thanks
for
the
many
blessings
which
were
hers
not
forgetting
to
ask
for
greater
favors
for
her
dear
mother
and
brother
whom
she
expected
so
soon
to
meet
in
two
short
weeks
at
the
time
which
had
been
fixed
when
she
would
return
to
her
home
a
simple
morning
dress
of
pink
delise
edged
with
white
set
off
her
light
figure
to
a
charm
her
snowy
collar
fastened
with
a
cross
and
taking
a
lily
of
the
valley
from
the
mysterious
bouquet
she
placed
it
in
her
hair
and
lest
winnie
had
been
playing
off
one
of
her
mischievous
tricks
she
descended
to
the
seated
upon
an
ottoman
was
no
other
than
clarence
delwood
who
arose
as
she
entered
taking
her
proffered
hand
with
some
little
embarrassment
which
was
soon
dispelled
by
the
adroit
winnie
who
took
a
seat
at
the
piano
and
with
a
rich
full
voice
sang
the
last
opera
your
friend
miss
santon
has
an
enviable
voice
remarked
delwood
to
natalie
regarding
the
lily
buds
which
he
recognized
as
of
the
bouquet
which
he
had
ordered
his
servant
to
place
in
the
hands
of
her
attendant
giving
no
name
of
the
donor
yes
i
love
to
listen
to
her
voice
it
is
so
full
of
feeling
she
has
a
peculiar
style
the
signor
tells
me
her
voice
is
of
great
talent
i
need
not
ask
of
your
own
voice
remarked
delwood
for
your
tone
betrays
you
yes
cried
winnie
who
in
spite
of
the
music
had
an
ear
alive
to
the
conversation
it
is
moved
and
seconded
that
miss
grosvenor
shall
give
us
a
benefit
and
if
she
fails
to
entertain
us
with
her
first
attempt
she
will
lay
herself
open
to
be
called
upon
again
she
may
rest
assured
that
your
sentiments
however
expressed
will
be
truth
in
regard
to
the
matter
for
you
are
far
from
being
a
flatterer
said
santon
as
entering
the
apartment
he
welcomed
delwood
to
his
house
natalie
chose
a
simple
piece
the
wanderer
home
and
as
the
sound
of
her
voice
died
away
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
room
winnie
was
the
first
to
break
the
spell
and
smiling
away
a
tear
she
exclaimed
i
had
forgotten
to
caution
you
against
too
great
success
in
charming
your
listeners
therefore
the
of
your
audience
will
not
permit
you
to
retire
without
feeding
the
flame
which
you
have
excited
remember
you
were
not
to
flatter
me
said
natalie
glancing
at
delwood
who
was
silently
contemplating
her
flattery
or
no
flattery
you
must
repeat
that
to
please
me
said
santon
making
manifest
exertions
to
clear
his
throat
and
looking
for
his
handkerchief
as
if
suddenly
seized
with
a
cold
the
piece
was
repeated
with
greater
effect
and
it
was
not
till
winnie
began
to
rally
him
that
delwood
was
aware
of
his
negligence
in
escorting
the
fair
songstress
to
a
seat
pardon
me
miss
grosvenor
he
said
but
the
first
tone
of
your
voice
carried
me
far
back
to
when
i
was
a
child
of
five
or
six
years
it
was
in
italy
where
my
father
spent
some
time
after
my
mother
death
and
it
so
happened
that
i
was
permitted
to
accompany
him
to
an
entertainment
given
by
an
italian
lady
of
note
who
in
the
course
of
the
evening
favored
the
company
with
a
song
i
was
engaged
with
some
sweetmeats
as
she
commenced
but
as
she
proceeded
gradually
they
fell
from
my
hands
and
when
she
had
finished
i
had
found
my
way
to
her
side
and
clinging
to
her
dress
i
burst
into
tears
begging
her
to
take
me
to
that
beautiful
place
again
it
is
years
since
i
have
thought
of
the
circumstance
and
i
trust
you
will
pardon
my
enthusiasm
when
i
say
that
your
wanderer
home
has
produced
a
similar
effect
natalie
expressed
her
thanks
for
the
compliment
with
blushing
modesty
and
as
delwood
bade
them
good
morning
after
having
made
arrangements
for
testing
their
courage
with
his
iron
grays
on
the
following
morning
so
long
did
his
eye
linger
upon
her
who
had
full
command
of
his
every
thought
that
he
did
not
observe
miss
winnie
who
was
trembling
lest
her
fresh
supply
of
mischief
should
come
to
an
unendurable
crisis
before
he
should
depart
it
was
soon
rumored
that
the
lion
had
been
tamed
that
the
beautiful
miss
grosvenor
had
found
her
way
to
the
heart
of
clarence
delwood
boston
beauties
sighed
and
those
who
had
been
unsuccessful
in
what
is
sometimes
termed
setting
their
caps
looked
on
with
interest
but
none
who
had
seen
the
favored
one
could
find
it
in
their
hearts
to
wish
her
other
than
a
life
of
joy
and
thus
time
passed
on
scarcely
a
day
sped
but
clarence
delwood
was
seen
ascending
the
steps
of
hospitable
mansion
as
winnie
expressed
herself
the
affair
was
coming
on
bravely
she
had
now
found
for
whom
natalie
was
reserving
that
heart
which
in
spite
of
her
caution
would
impart
to
others
its
only
element
the
time
was
also
drawing
near
when
natalie
was
to
have
made
glad
her
mother
heart
by
her
presence
old
vingo
had
desired
his
massa
harry
to
write
to
young
missy
dat
eben
de
breakers
gettin
impatient
to
see
her
once
more
and
dat
he
walk
alone
now
on
de
beach
in
de
moonlight
but
he
neber
to
find
anoder
in
a
few
days
the
santon
family
were
to
part
with
natalie
it
was
in
vain
they
had
urged
upon
her
to
remain
with
them
another
season
for
as
much
as
she
had
become
attached
to
them
all
she
longed
to
see
her
home
once
more
even
winnie
failed
to
keep
time
with
her
usually
joyous
spirits
and
there
was
one
to
whom
this
parting
was
not
to
be
thought
of
delwood
had
as
yet
received
no
positive
assurance
that
his
unmistakable
sentiments
towards
natalie
were
reciprocated
and
yet
he
was
confident
that
she
regarded
him
with
no
common
interest
he
had
read
it
in
her
soul
but
he
would
hear
from
her
own
lips
if
happiness
or
misery
was
to
be
his
through
life
and
it
was
with
a
nervous
step
that
he
wended
his
way
on
this
last
evening
of
her
stay
in
boston
that
he
might
hear
his
fate
as
he
drew
near
the
house
he
observed
though
early
in
the
evening
but
one
dim
light
gleaming
from
an
upper
apartment
and
as
he
reached
the
gate
it
was
fast
and
a
porter
stood
within
who
to
delwood
hurried
question
if
all
was
well
as
he
threw
him
a
replied
in
a
sad
tone
kind
sir
my
orders
are
to
receive
no
one
as
my
mistress
is
dying
or
you
should
have
admittance
at
once
but
i
know
that
you
of
all
others
could
serve
to
lighten
the
blow
to
my
master
and
if
you
take
the
responsibility
you
shall
be
admitted
leave
that
with
me
he
replied
you
shall
not
be
censured
and
with
assumed
calmness
of
manner
he
entered
noiselessly
he
opened
the
outer
door
proceeding
to
the
upper
which
opened
to
the
room
of
the
dying
one
santon
sat
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
sobbing
aloud
delwood
took
him
tenderly
by
the
hand
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
which
seemed
to
rouse
him
from
the
dreadful
state
of
mind
to
which
he
had
yielded
you
find
here
a
house
of
mourning
he
said
but
your
presence
is
most
welcome
what
can
i
do
for
you
in
this
trying
hour
asked
delwood
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
submit
to
the
will
of
god
he
answered
and
i
pray
that
i
may
have
strength
so
to
do
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
death
was
opened
and
the
physician
summoned
santon
to
his
dying
wife
bedside
delwood
stood
in
the
door
pale
but
not
emaciated
were
the
features
upon
which
death
had
set
his
seal
her
last
moment
was
near
but
she
had
strength
and
consciousness
supported
by
the
to
say
a
few
parting
words
with
one
hand
in
that
of
her
husband
the
other
upon
the
head
of
her
daughter
she
said
farewell
my
dearest
husband
it
is
but
a
little
parting
you
will
meet
me
there
at
last
turning
to
the
with
her
hand
still
upon
the
head
of
her
daughter
she
added
my
child
will
soon
be
motherless
through
you
she
is
what
i
could
wish
to
see
her
and
when
i
am
gone
will
you
never
lose
sight
of
her
make
her
to
be
like
yourself
in
a
feeble
voice
she
continued
thank
god
that
we
may
see
heaven
upon
earth
the
gentle
spirit
is
pointing
me
to
my
rest
a
slight
trembling
of
her
weary
frame
and
she
had
gone
to
be
with
the
just
made
perfect
a
smile
was
upon
her
features
and
they
smoothed
her
limbs
as
for
a
night
repose
the
father
mingled
his
tears
with
those
of
his
child
who
was
all
that
was
left
to
him
the
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
him
who
thought
it
not
unmanly
to
weep
over
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
retired
leaving
the
afflicted
ones
to
weep
away
the
anguish
in
their
hearts
ere
they
might
look
upon
the
loving
kindness
of
him
whose
ways
are
all
perfect

my
gentle
reader
will
pardon
the
long
stride
of
time
which
here
intervenes
disclosing
nothing
of
those
in
whom
we
feel
an
interest
nearly
a
year
of
moments
had
sped
since
that
in
which
santon
had
passed
away
winnie
had
seen
her
loved
mother
laid
in
that
narrow
silent
house
which
is
prepared
for
the
dead
and
her
tears
had
watered
the
green
grass
which
groweth
so
silently
upspringing
everywhere
even
in
the
lonely
places
of
burial
a
fit
covering
for
those
who
slumber
emblematical
of
the
life
beyond
the
tomb
the
joyous
mirth
which
abode
in
winnie
nature
had
superseded
in
a
measure
days
of
deep
mourning
yet
this
first
taste
of
earth
sorrow
had
left
an
impress
upon
her
mind
never
to
be
erased
and
though
thoughtless
ones
perhaps
observed
no
change
in
her
young
elastic
spirits
there
was
one
gentle
and
youthful
who
had
been
to
her
as
a
mother
in
her
bereavement
the
she
could
see
that
the
death
of
a
loved
one
had
wrought
a
good
work
upon
the
heart
of
her
friend
as
it
may
with
us
all
if
we
will
lie
passive
in
the
hands
of
the
workman
it
was
a
disappointment
to
natalie
that
her
intention
of
returning
home
had
been
frustrated
yet
it
was
with
cheerfulness
that
she
resigned
her
hopes
when
she
saw
that
duty
pointed
out
another
way
santon
on
the
sudden
death
of
his
wife
which
occurred
on
the
very
evening
before
natalie
was
to
bid
them
farewell
had
himself
written
a
very
touching
letter
to
grosvenor
begging
if
it
were
not
asking
of
her
too
much
that
she
would
spare
her
daughter
to
them
a
little
while
longer
as
it
had
been
the
last
wish
of
santon
that
their
daughter
might
be
with
her
who
had
proved
such
a
blessing
to
them
all
and
so
in
pity
for
the
dear
ones
of
her
friend
of
whose
death
she
was
pained
to
learn
grosvenor
had
consented
to
another
year
separation
from
her
child
though
it
was
indeed
asking
of
her
a
great
sacrifice
old
vingo
who
had
wondered
if
his
young
missy
would
take
him
by
the
hand
as
she
used
when
he
heard
that
another
long
year
must
pass
before
he
would
see
her
again
cried
like
a
child
but
no
one
was
more
disappointed
than
harry
who
had
counted
the
days
for
months
when
she
would
come
home
but
his
patience
was
not
to
be
tested
thus
he
had
visited
his
sister
in
boston
and
had
received
so
favorable
an
impression
of
city
life
or
it
may
be
that
he
had
received
a
more
favorable
impression
of
a
certain
pair
of
black
eyes
which
were
constantly
fixed
upon
him
when
he
had
accidentally
glanced
towards
a
certain
young
lady
whom
report
said
montague
being
among
the
foremost
to
give
credit
thereto
was
the
greatest
catch
in
town
whether
it
was
actually
the
lady
beauty
in
question
which
had
dazzled
scores
of
disengaged
young
men
or
whether
they
had
seen
visions
of
a
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
but
this
much
we
can
perceive
that
a
beautiful
young
heiress
left
to
her
own
discretion
in
the
choosing
of
a
partner
for
life
stands
in
a
critical
situation
and
if
these
innuendoes
refer
to
miss
winnie
santon
we
are
foremost
in
wishing
our
young
nautical
friend
success
in
the
great
game
of
hearts
for
we
can
see
too
much
of
worth
in
her
character
for
her
to
be
thrown
away
on
a
worthless
dandy
whose
money
for
the
little
time
that
it
keeps
him
company
is
his
god
be
all
this
as
it
may
harry
grosvenor
had
found
several
opportunities
for
visiting
his
sister
and
upon
each
visit
he
was
received
not
only
by
the
but
by
winnie
herself
with
a
warm
welcome
but
winnie
as
we
have
discovered
has
been
a
sad
coquette
another
year
however
has
been
added
to
her
age
since
we
saw
her
in
society
last
and
this
last
year
so
different
from
any
other
of
her
sunny
life
has
brought
with
it
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
many
perhaps
the
influence
which
fortunately
she
has
been
under
may
have
had
its
effect
upon
her
character
which
is
now
forming
itself
and
yet
her
bewitching
smile
which
harry
loved
to
dwell
upon
when
he
had
returned
to
his
island
home
as
second
only
to
his
matchless
sister
was
very
like
those
which
she
had
bestowed
upon
many
an
elated
gallant
natalie
had
not
failed
to
notice
the
seeming
pleasure
with
which
her
brother
had
listened
to
winnie
brilliant
conversation
and
she
had
asked
herself
if
it
were
possible
that
winnie
could
be
so
heartless
as
to
impress
her
brother
with
erroneous
views
in
regard
to
her
sentiments
she
would
not
believe
that
she
had
the
heart
to
do
it
and
yet
through
habit
and
a
perfect
thoughtlessness
of
the
consequences
she
might
be
led
to
do
so
it
was
evening
and
the
two
sat
folded
in
each
other
arms
gazing
at
an
autumn
sunset
winnie
was
still
in
her
black
habiliments
for
it
was
not
quite
a
year
since
santon
had
died
harry
had
left
them
the
day
before
and
had
bade
them
both
a
warm
farewell
winnie
had
been
silent
for
some
moments
when
natalie
remarked
what
new
scheme
are
you
planning
now
winnie
you
are
very
thoughtful
winnie
roused
herself
and
blushingly
replied
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
note
my
thoughtful
moments
i
am
such
a
gay
creature
but
dear
natalie
there
are
times
when
even
can
be
serious
though
there
are
few
who
could
credit
my
words
i
can
believe
you
winnie
for
i
know
you
have
a
good
heart
but
what
can
have
occurred
of
sufficient
importance
to
banish
those
dimples
from
your
cheek
come
rogue
make
me
your
confidant
or
i
shall
begin
to
think
you
are
at
your
old
tricks
after
all
if
i
did
not
know
your
forgiving
spirit
i
should
hesitate
to
place
myself
in
your
power
for
fear
you
might
repay
me
with
interest
in
making
you
and
your
particular
friend
delwood
the
subjects
of
my
merriment
natalie
looked
calmly
into
her
eyes
the
truth
flashed
across
her
mind
at
once
and
she
was
about
to
clasp
her
in
her
arms
calling
her
by
the
name
of
sister
when
a
voice
from
behind
them
repeated
the
name
and
delwood
was
by
her
side
where
did
you
learn
the
name
by
which
i
am
called
in
my
island
home
asked
natalie
why
did
you
never
tell
us
that
you
have
a
name
in
keeping
with
your
character
he
asked
taking
the
seat
by
her
side
which
winnie
who
had
retired
to
hide
her
blushes
had
vacated
is
the
name
by
which
my
father
loved
to
call
me
and
i
associate
it
with
his
sacred
memory
she
replied
and
a
tear
which
delwood
looked
upon
as
also
sacred
fell
upon
the
hand
which
clasped
her
as
with
reverential
fervency
your
brother
told
me
of
the
name
he
replied
and
will
you
permit
me
to
associate
with
that
name
all
that
is
of
purity
may
i
not
call
you
by
that
name
can
you
give
one
thought
to
him
whose
very
happiness
for
life
is
dependent
on
you
there
was
a
pause
delwood
had
never
until
this
night
declared
to
her
his
love
in
so
many
measured
words
which
were
but
coldness
in
comparison
with
the
love
for
her
which
filled
his
soul
a
year
ago
would
have
sealed
his
doom
but
that
night
witnessed
another
scene
death
had
claimed
it
for
his
own
the
hand
which
he
held
was
not
withdrawn
neither
did
a
simper
mark
her
reply
with
eyes
meekly
turned
upward
she
answered
in
a
calm
low
voice
my
dear
father
is
in
heaven
if
he
is
looking
down
i
feel
that
he
will
smile
upon
me
when
with
my
consent
she
shall
give
me
away
to
you
i
have
long
ago
given
myself
to
christ
and
if
you
recognize
him
as
your
saviour
we
will
together
serve
him
as
dutiful
children
praying
one
for
the
other
that
we
may
not
fall
i
am
not
like
you
he
replied
i
can
never
be
as
pure
as
you
are
neither
am
i
what
the
world
calls
a
christian
but
by
god
help
i
pledge
myself
to
be
one
of
christ
followers
and
of
one
thing
i
am
confident
i
shall
never
be
if
i
grope
my
way
alone
through
the
world
as
i
must
if
i
lose
you
what
i
shall
be
if
i
have
you
for
a
guide
it
is
enough
you
depreciate
your
own
merits
she
said
glancing
proudly
upon
him
go
when
i
return
and
with
your
own
lips
ask
my
mother
if
she
can
find
a
place
in
her
noblest
of
women
hearts
for
him
who
is
all
too
worthy
of
her
daughter
love
he
folded
her
to
his
heart
and
the
rich
harvest
moon
had
sunk
far
below
the
horizon
ere
these
two
kindred
spirits
had
wearied
of
the
glorious
night
santon
had
not
felt
the
utter
desolation
after
the
first
overpowering
sense
of
grief
had
passed
after
his
wife
death
that
he
would
have
felt
had
he
had
no
one
upon
whom
to
have
leaned
as
it
was
his
home
was
not
desolate
for
he
cherished
his
daughter
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
and
he
had
come
to
be
like
himself
again
happy
faces
met
him
as
he
came
in
wearied
from
his
duties
on
and
he
had
again
assumed
his
easy
jocose
manners
natalie
was
still
continuing
her
studies
making
unprecedented
progress
to
the
rapturous
delight
of
the
signor
while
winnie
enlivened
the
whole
household
as
mistress
of
the
mansion
she
had
new
duties
to
discharge
though
they
were
not
so
arduous
as
to
deprive
her
of
entertaining
the
young
aspirants
to
her
hand
who
if
they
did
not
throw
themselves
at
her
feet
it
was
only
for
the
want
of
an
opportunity
and
thus
was
everything
going
on
harmoniously
at
santon
mansion
when
to
the
no
little
surprise
of
every
one
it
was
rumored
that
the
wealthy
santon
was
about
to
introduce
to
his
domains
a
new
mistress
no
one
was
more
taken
by
surprise
than
were
winnie
and
natalie
they
could
hardly
credit
their
senses
when
santon
congratulated
his
daughter
on
the
prospect
of
having
a
new
mother
poor
winnie
she
tried
to
smile
and
she
tried
to
make
one
of
her
most
brilliant
remarks
as
she
congratulated
her
father
on
his
happiness
yet
it
was
not
like
herself
and
natalie
could
see
what
santon
in
his
blindness
of
joy
did
not
discern
there
was
no
heart
in
his
mechanical
tones
winnie
had
not
as
yet
seen
her
intended
she
might
be
all
that
could
be
desired
of
one
standing
in
that
peculiar
relation
and
she
might
be
otherwise
it
was
not
that
which
had
quelled
the
buoyant
spirits
of
the
heiress
it
was
that
she
shrank
from
the
thought
of
any
one
so
soon
filling
her
own
dear
mother
station
and
she
hid
her
face
in
natalie
golden
tresses
as
her
father
left
the
room
and
burst
into
tears
dear
dear
natalie
she
exclaimed
you
will
think
me
so
wicked
but
i
wanted
no
other
mother
than
you
though
you
are
younger
than
myself
i
have
learned
to
look
up
to
you
as
a
valuable
bequest
left
me
by
my
mother
who
smiled
even
in
death
when
you
promised
never
to
forget
me
we
are
happy
now
why
need
a
stranger
come
among
us
oh
natalie
i
never
can
part
from
you
hush
hush
dear
winnie
you
must
not
think
thus
you
may
come
to
love
your
new
mother
filling
the
most
sanguine
wishes
of
your
heart
who
would
be
wretched
if
his
daughter
were
not
reconciled
to
her
who
will
stand
in
the
nearest
relation
to
him
and
thus
the
endeavored
to
prepare
winnie
mind
for
receiving
her
new
mother
who
would
so
soon
take
her
place
at
the
head
of
this
once
unbroken
family
as
became
a
meek
and
dutiful
child
but
she
did
not
tell
her
of
the
trembling
within
her
own
heart
lest
this
new
tie
should
prove
a
source
of
sorrows
sowing
her
youthful
heart
with
seed
which
might
be
productive
of
bitter
among
the
sweets
neither
did
she
know
of
the
prayers
of
the
innocent
maiden
that
hers
might
be
a
thornless
path
the
lady
in
question
whom
santon
had
deemed
worthy
of
his
hand
and
its
consequent
honors
was
of
a
family
of
lower
standing
than
his
own
as
far
as
much
of
this
world
goods
go
to
give
caste
but
if
aside
from
depth
of
purse
she
was
his
inferior
we
have
yet
to
learn
the
marriage
ceremonies
were
attended
with
little
display
in
deference
to
santon
wishes
and
the
day
at
length
arrived
when
the
bride
who
resided
in
a
neighboring
city
was
to
be
received
in
her
new
home
she
came
and
congratulations
were
exchanged
between
mother
and
daughter
first
impressions
were
made
and
the
hour
arrived
which
should
liberate
each
one
to
the
night
repose
winnie
flew
to
her
room
she
had
seen
her
whom
she
was
to
call
mother
and
from
the
few
hours
which
she
had
already
passed
with
her
her
superior
discernment
of
character
had
judged
of
her
aright
she
never
had
cause
to
vary
from
the
opinion
which
she
had
from
the
first
formed
of
her
she
choked
back
the
tears
so
strange
to
see
within
her
eyes
and
kneeling
she
repeated
the
very
first
prayer
her
mother
had
ever
taught
her
an
exercise
which
from
the
example
set
before
her
for
the
last
two
years
she
now
never
failed
to
observe
arising
she
endeavored
to
dispel
the
mountain
of
anguish
which
was
creeping
into
her
soul
in
sleep
poor
winnie
we
can
pity
you
but
life
lesson
taught
the
impression
which
natalie
had
received
of
the
second
wife
of
santon
choice
though
she
would
not
bring
herself
to
realize
it
were
by
no
means
prepossessing
she
had
schooled
her
own
and
winnie
heart
to
love
her
under
any
circumstances
but
when
she
saw
with
what
frigidity
she
received
winnie
warm
welcome
thinking
not
of
the
condescension
with
which
she
had
taken
her
own
hand
her
tender
heart
was
pierced
as
winnie
looked
toward
her
as
if
for
strength
and
she
had
returned
her
look
with
a
smile
which
could
not
fail
to
prove
to
her
a
ray
of
sunshine
why
is
it
that
it
is
of
so
frequent
occurrence
that
a
man
who
has
been
blessed
with
peculiar
loveliness
of
character
in
a
wife
if
he
be
called
upon
to
part
with
her
finds
alas
too
late
in
a
second
partner
an
extreme
opposite
it
was
thus
in
santon
experience
as
he
but
too
soon
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
to
himself
though
he
would
not
that
others
should
have
a
suspicion
of
the
fact
yet
it
was
evident
to
his
nearest
friends
that
he
was
not
the
happy
man
he
once
was
the
few
sprinkles
of
gray
which
had
reflected
honor
upon
the
raven
black
of
his
hair
had
increased
ere
the
was
hardly
ended
early
the
next
morning
after
the
arrival
of
santon
winnie
was
awakened
by
an
attendant
whose
sense
of
propriety
were
a
question
if
placed
in
a
balance
with
that
of
her
new
mistress
which
were
the
weightier
the
woman
apologized
for
disturbing
her
but
the
new
mistress
would
like
to
see
miss
santon
in
the
as
soon
as
possible
you
can
go
was
winnie
reply
and
tell
santon
that
at
my
convenience
i
will
see
her
but
recalling
the
servant
with
her
next
thought
she
added
merely
say
to
my
mother
that
i
will
soon
be
with
her
and
hastily
making
her
toilet
she
repaired
to
the
santon
was
alone
for
it
was
a
full
hour
before
the
family
usual
time
for
arising
winnie
bade
her
mother
good
morning
and
was
about
to
ask
if
she
had
rested
well
in
her
new
home
when
she
was
interrupted
by
her
and
in
an
imperative
tone
she
said
this
may
be
earlier
than
you
have
been
accustomed
to
miss
santon
but
my
habits
for
early
rising
are
proverbial
and
of
course
my
household
will
conform
to
my
wishes
in
regard
to
matters
which
you
will
at
once
see
are
for
the
best
what
i
wished
to
speak
with
you
more
particularly
about
this
morning
is
in
regard
to
the
keys
you
will
please
produce
them
as
i
shall
have
a
thorough
overhauling
at
once
and
if
i
mistake
not
said
she
glancing
at
winnie
neat
morning
attire
the
sooner
the
better
for
i
think
those
jewelled
hands
have
not
troubled
themselves
much
about
such
things
i
wonder
that
you
have
not
been
brought
up
to
something
beside
killing
time
madam
vociferated
winnie
her
face
crimsoned
with
the
insult
which
she
had
received
but
she
paused
though
still
trembling
with
rage
her
eye
had
rested
on
a
gentle
form
standing
within
the
open
door
it
was
the
with
one
finger
upon
her
lip
her
brow
calm
as
the
new
day
she
gazed
upon
winnie
till
gaining
her
eye
unobserved
by
santon
she
glided
away
instead
of
the
rage
winnie
would
have
poured
forth
she
merely
said
i
will
send
you
the
keys
and
left
the
room
despatching
a
servant
with
the
keys
which
she
had
intended
to
have
put
into
her
hands
at
the
earliest
opportunity
thereby
acknowledging
her
superior
claim
at
once
she
sought
natalie
whom
she
found
seated
in
the
conservatory
enjoying
the
indian
summer
breeze
which
stole
softly
in
among
the
fragrant
plants
which
were
the
particular
objects
of
her
care
each
knew
what
was
uppermost
in
the
other
mind
but
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
i
have
been
thinking
winnie
said
the
how
thankful
we
should
be
that
we
have
so
many
friends
to
love
us
i
think
i
have
never
realized
it
until
now
and
she
spoke
in
a
lower
tone
dear
winnie
should
you
ever
receive
other
than
the
kindly
treatment
to
which
you
have
always
been
accustomed
let
it
serve
to
increase
your
gratitude
that
you
have
so
many
with
whom
you
can
trust
your
affections
yes
natalie
i
will
strive
to
do
aright
i
will
try
to
do
as
i
think
you
would
have
done
but
i
fear
i
shall
not
have
your
strength
o
it
is
so
hard
if
i
only
had
a
mother
to
love
me
i
could
endure
anything
else
and
her
excitable
nature
getting
the
better
of
her
she
burst
into
tears
natalie
threw
her
arm
about
her
neck
and
her
own
voice
tremulous
with
the
pity
which
she
felt
for
her
she
tried
to
soothe
her
spirits
you
shall
have
a
mother
my
mother
shall
be
your
mother
for
are
you
not
to
be
my
sister
and
she
will
love
you
as
did
your
own
gentle
mother
but
santon
will
yet
become
reconciled
to
you
for
when
she
finds
what
a
good
heart
you
have
she
can
not
but
treat
you
with
kindness
at
this
juncture
the
door
opened
and
santon
brushed
rudely
in
welladay
is
this
your
usual
morning
occupation
miss
grosvenor
i
think
you
should
have
more
wisdom
than
to
be
petting
a
spoiled
child
i
imagine
that
i
shall
have
as
much
as
i
shall
care
to
undertake
to
undo
the
mischief
which
is
already
too
apparent
it
has
been
as
much
as
i
could
do
for
the
last
two
hours
to
get
things
a
little
in
order
but
i
suppose
i
need
not
look
for
assistance
here
she
scornfully
said
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
winnie
had
it
upon
her
tongue
end
to
reply
my
father
employs
his
servants
to
keep
his
house
in
order
and
they
have
never
failed
to
give
satisfaction
but
biting
her
lip
the
thought
died
away
natalie
arrested
santon
steps
saying
winnie
and
myself
will
consider
it
a
pleasure
to
assist
you
and
whatever
we
can
do
at
any
time
for
your
enjoyment
we
shall
be
most
happy
to
do
it
the
woman
quailed
a
little
at
the
proffered
assistance
and
natalie
accompanied
her
to
the
upper
wondering
much
what
could
have
given
offence
to
her
ideas
of
a
house
for
under
the
housekeeper
scrupulous
care
everything
was
kept
in
the
nicest
order
desiring
natalie
to
assist
her
in
the
disposal
of
some
articles
she
directed
winnie
to
find
some
place
and
to
stow
away
the
rubbish
which
she
would
find
in
the
next
apartment
pointing
to
the
room
which
had
been
her
mother
and
which
winnie
had
not
permitted
any
one
to
disturb
since
her
death
everything
had
been
left
just
as
she
had
left
it
even
some
withered
flowers
had
not
been
removed
and
the
book
from
which
she
had
read
had
been
left
opened
at
the
place
her
eye
had
last
looked
upon
this
room
had
been
kept
as
a
place
sacred
to
winnie
heart
and
indeed
the
very
servants
passed
it
by
with
a
blessing
on
their
departed
mistress
and
it
was
now
with
trembling
steps
that
winnie
hardly
realizing
what
had
been
said
to
her
followed
in
the
direction
which
the
cruel
woman
had
pointed
she
opened
the
door
and
sank
fainting
into
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
were
the
very
clothes
which
her
mother
had
worn
with
other
articles
thrown
together
in
a
pile
her
mother
portrait
had
been
removed
and
the
room
was
otherwise
in
disorder
natalie
ran
to
winnie
assistance
bathing
her
temples
and
smoothing
back
her
long
tresses
with
tenderness
just
at
that
moment
santon
entered
the
room
he
looked
at
his
daughter
at
the
disordered
apartment
of
his
buried
wife
which
he
had
never
held
more
sacred
and
he
looked
at
santon
without
speaking
a
word
he
left
the
room
poor
winnie
this
is
indeed
life
lesson
but
thou
art
learning
to
suffer
and
be
strong
had
the
character
of
the
been
in
accordance
with
her
exterior
santon
mansion
might
still
have
resounded
with
joy
for
hers
was
a
face
by
no
means
forbidding
on
the
contrary
a
stranger
would
have
pronounced
her
to
be
decidedly
considering
that
she
was
a
woman
of
nearly
fifty
years
and
those
good
looks
were
the
secret
of
santon
unfortunate
connection
with
her
from
the
first
the
woman
had
taken
a
dislike
to
natalie
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
determined
to
spite
her
in
every
way
possible
why
she
should
have
felt
thus
toward
her
was
certainly
unaccountable
as
there
was
no
trait
more
unlovable
than
innocency
about
her
character
but
this
very
gentleness
of
nature
in
contrast
with
the
iciness
seldom
found
in
woman
heart
would
as
an
unavoidable
result
serve
to
widen
the
two
extremes
the
would
as
time
advanced
have
sought
refuge
in
her
own
home
from
this
mist
of
unrest
which
had
by
degrees
spread
itself
around
but
when
she
had
spoken
of
the
thing
to
santon
he
had
grasped
her
by
the
hand
as
a
drowning
man
would
catch
at
a
straw
saying
if
she
would
not
entirely
sever
the
golden
thread
which
was
once
bound
around
their
home
circle
she
would
defer
her
departure
for
at
least
a
little
time
and
she
had
seen
the
tear
which
was
as
molten
lead
welling
up
from
the
strong
man
heart
then
she
said
it
is
my
duty
i
will
remain
with
you
i
feel
there
is
something
which
bids
me
stay
some
mysterious
power
controlling
my
destiny
may
you
have
your
reward
was
santon
reply
and
we
heartily
respond
may
she
have
her
reward
never
a
word
did
santon
receive
from
the
in
return
for
her
ungenerous
treatment
of
her
other
than
tones
of
kindness
and
natalie
was
happy
under
this
new
dispensation
for
she
said
within
herself
i
am
but
bearing
a
part
of
the
burden
which
would
crush
dear
winnie
heart
and
so
she
sang
and
played
with
her
usual
glad
spirit
gliding
about
the
house
with
simple
dignity
with
a
cheering
word
for
every
one
and
as
biddy
said
she
was
an
escaped
ray
of
light
too
bright
for
the
darkness
to
hide
as
we
may
foresee
this
very
of
the
only
served
to
incite
the
ire
of
santon
who
saw
that
every
new
indignity
which
she
had
cast
upon
her
was
returned
with
more
meekness
of
spirit
if
natalie
had
resented
such
conduct
giving
measure
for
measure
the
stern
woman
could
have
borne
it
better
but
as
it
was
it
enraged
her
that
she
could
not
come
within
her
sphere
and
if
the
truth
were
known
her
senses
were
not
so
steeped
in
the
waters
of
insensibility
but
that
in
her
very
heart
she
felt
her
great
superiority
over
herself
i
will
put
her
down
yet
she
said
to
herself
after
another
return
through
the
of
good
for
evil
she
shall
yet
feel
my
power
and
why
santon
will
persist
in
her
staying
with
us
is
more
than
i
can
tell
but
that
is
the
way
with
these
men
they
will
get
strange
notions
into
their
heads
which
nobody
can
account
for
even
a
wife
wishes
are
looked
upon
as
of
little
consequence
in
comparison
with
their
lordly
commands
i
should
not
be
surprised
at
any
time
if
santon
should
withhold
a
favor
from
me
to
lavish
upon
her
but
thinking
that
he
will
before
long
find
out
what
i
am
made
of
if
he
thwarts
my
wishes
to
be
sure
his
daughter
has
become
attached
to
her
but
what
of
that
she
must
learn
that
she
can
not
have
every
whim
gratified
she
is
a
spoiled
child
at
best
and
will
not
be
likely
to
improve
under
her
discipline
leave
me
alone
for
managing
affairs
i
got
the
staff
in
my
own
hands
and
all
they
can
do
wont
make
me
anything
but
the
honorable
santon
lady
though
i
greatly
mistaken
if
he
do
look
with
evil
eyes
on
the
day
that
made
me
his
bride
but
that
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
as
i
used
to
tell
my
first
husband
poor
fellow
i
suppose
i
was
rather
hard
upon
him
once
in
a
while
but
i
knew
he
was
waiting
patiently
for
the
day
which
should
separate
us
he
little
thought
he
would
go
first
and
the
woman
laughed
aloud
as
she
thought
how
she
had
crept
into
the
good
graces
of
her
present
husband
leave
me
alone
for
playing
my
part
she
said
as
seated
in
her
own
apartment
she
listened
to
the
voice
of
delwood
in
the
it
is
evident
that
her
very
life
is
wrapt
up
in
delwood
and
it
is
really
quite
a
pity
that
so
fine
a
fellow
should
be
deceived
and
lest
she
should
follow
my
illustrious
example
i
might
as
well
interfere
in
their
arrangements
and
if
i
can
see
aright
she
has
talked
the
enviable
heiress
into
the
belief
that
her
brother
is
a
very
paragon
of
perfection
for
she
knows
right
well
that
a
good
bag
of
money
would
be
no
serious
objection
to
his
fishermanship
how
they
ever
raised
two
such
likely
looking
specimens
of
humanity
down
there
in
the
land
of
whales
is
a
mystery
but
they
find
they
can
not
take
the
precedence
with
boston
gentry
if
i
can
avail
anything
my
particular
friend
montague
shall
try
his
luck
in
securing
that
portion
of
the
estate
which
i
shall
be
pleased
to
leave
her
with
these
plans
matured
she
ushered
herself
into
delwood
presence
and
in
her
blandest
manner
made
him
welcome
initiating
herself
as
far
as
possible
into
his
good
opinion
which
was
no
difficult
task
inasmuch
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
a
character
so
spotless
that
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
detestable
machinations
of
one
who
was
not
worthy
the
name
of
woman
it
had
been
far
from
the
to
breathe
a
suspicion
that
there
was
aught
amiss
in
the
character
of
the
flattering
mistress
of
santon
mansion
her
high
esteem
for
santon
had
not
permitted
her
to
speak
of
the
sad
change
even
to
her
mother
my
dear
said
santon
turning
to
natalie
in
the
pleasure
which
we
must
ever
find
in
delwood
society
you
have
forgotten
your
engagement
with
the
destitute
family
which
you
have
taken
under
your
especial
charge
and
poor
brown
child
is
so
ill
i
fear
a
few
hours
delay
in
taking
the
necessary
restoratives
recommended
by
our
physician
may
cause
the
poor
thing
to
suffer
i
would
despatch
an
attendant
but
i
fear
there
may
be
some
mistake
made
and
i
know
your
very
presence
will
impart
comfort
to
the
poor
woman
oh
no
i
had
not
forgotten
them
replied
natalie
but
the
physician
said
any
time
this
afternoon
would
do
as
the
little
sufferer
disease
is
about
turning
and
we
must
await
the
result
yes
but
i
have
such
an
anxiety
about
them
for
in
their
ignorance
they
may
act
contrary
to
orders
and
so
be
the
means
of
the
little
death
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
my
mind
if
you
will
just
step
around
and
look
in
upon
them
as
it
is
but
a
step
and
i
know
delwood
will
excuse
you
for
a
few
moments
and
i
will
promise
to
do
my
best
to
supply
your
absence
natalie
prepared
to
depart
on
this
errand
of
mercy
and
delwood
would
have
taken
his
hat
to
accompany
her
but
santon
held
him
fast
by
commencing
a
brisk
conversation
from
which
he
could
not
with
politeness
take
himself
away
miss
grosvenor
excels
in
her
performance
of
the
latest
style
which
the
signor
has
introduced
remarked
santon
endeavoring
to
draw
him
out
when
the
had
departed
i
am
perfectly
amazed
at
her
original
rendering
of
the
italian
replied
delwood
and
i
think
i
can
safely
say
that
among
all
my
sojournings
among
their
people
i
have
never
met
with
one
whose
style
is
more
pure
than
that
of
miss
grosvenor
i
should
certainly
say
that
she
is
of
italian
birth
though
she
tells
me
that
she
has
never
crossed
the
atlantic
she
is
evidently
captivated
with
their
people
or
perhaps
i
may
more
properly
say
with
the
only
person
she
has
ever
met
of
that
nation
said
santon
with
a
mysterious
manner
to
what
or
whom
do
you
refer
asked
delwood
in
an
altered
tone
of
voice
delwood
i
feel
that
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
of
a
matter
which
has
been
a
source
of
no
little
uneasiness
not
only
to
myself
but
to
every
member
of
my
family
and
as
you
have
shown
a
manifest
interest
in
miss
grosvenor
it
is
not
well
that
you
should
remain
in
ignorance
of
what
so
deeply
concerns
your
welfare
speak
what
can
it
be
asked
delwood
pale
with
emotion
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
thus
moved
i
pray
you
but
what
i
have
to
say
is
that
three
months
ago
we
gave
the
signor
notice
that
we
should
require
his
services
no
longer
as
we
had
reason
to
believe
his
visits
were
becoming
something
more
than
mere
professional
calls
and
to
our
great
consternation
we
found
that
miss
grosvenor
was
not
entirely
indifferent
to
his
marked
attentions
i
was
the
last
to
believe
that
miss
grosvenor
could
so
lose
her
and
standing
as
to
look
upon
a
poor
professor
who
gains
his
bread
by
his
own
exertions
as
a
favored
competitor
for
her
hand
and
it
was
not
until
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
that
i
could
credit
what
i
had
heard
i
was
satisfied
in
time
that
his
rapt
admiration
as
he
gazed
upon
her
was
something
more
than
enthusiasm
that
she
had
excelled
even
his
most
ardent
expectations
and
the
expression
of
her
beautiful
face
as
she
concluded
might
have
been
the
envy
of
a
greater
than
the
signor
we
dismissed
the
signor
but
he
still
continued
his
visits
under
the
plea
that
it
was
his
custom
to
give
a
few
additional
lessons
at
the
close
of
a
course
and
if
he
might
be
allowed
he
should
consider
it
a
valuable
acquisition
to
his
own
musical
powers
to
continue
for
a
time
his
exercises
under
miss
grosvenor
superior
talent
as
santon
paused
delwood
in
a
state
of
frenzy
exclaimed
it
can
not
be
i
will
never
believe
that
she
is
false
to
me
even
though
she
should
declare
to
me
with
her
own
lips
that
another
claims
upon
her
affections
were
paramount
to
my
own
excuse
me
madam
but
i
think
there
must
be
some
dreadful
misunderstanding
in
regard
to
the
facts
which
you
have
stated
no
i
would
scorn
myself
if
i
had
a
doubt
of
her
innocence
and
if
such
a
thing
might
be
possible
i
would
die
rather
than
be
forced
to
believe
it
i
will
tell
her
this
very
day
what
i
have
heard
but
i
will
not
degrade
myself
or
forfeit
her
trust
by
asking
her
if
it
can
be
so
be
calm
my
dear
friend
said
santon
compose
yourself
i
pray
you
and
take
my
advice
in
the
matter
say
nothing
of
what
you
have
heard
to
any
one
but
come
here
morning
at
ten
when
the
signor
will
make
his
appearance
and
from
a
private
window
opening
from
the
conservatory
you
may
unknown
to
any
one
witness
for
yourself
the
truth
of
what
i
have
said
i
will
follow
your
advice
inasmuch
as
i
will
reveal
to
no
one
what
i
have
heard
until
i
become
like
myself
said
delwood
endeavoring
to
compose
himself
as
he
heard
the
light
step
of
the
in
the
hall
and
as
she
entered
he
arose
to
depart
pleading
a
slight
indisposition
as
an
apology
for
his
abruptness
the
calm
spiritual
eyes
of
natalie
looked
out
upon
him
as
he
walked
rapidly
down
the
street
for
she
could
not
but
notice
an
estrangement
in
his
manners
but
she
did
not
mistrust
that
an
arrow
poisoned
by
sin
in
its
vilest
form
had
been
aimed
at
his
heart
the
starry
heavens
of
that
night
told
that
another
day
had
gone
to
be
with
the
past
and
innocence
laid
her
head
upon
her
pillow
and
slept
unmindful
of
plots
of
guilt
engendered
of
sin
which
might
prove
for
her
a
draught
of
bitterness
at
an
early
hour
the
following
morning
clarence
delwood
bent
his
steps
towards
the
residence
of
santon
come
here
and
you
shall
see
for
yourself
those
words
still
sounded
in
his
ears
and
as
he
drew
nearer
the
house
it
seemed
as
if
they
grew
louder
and
louder
till
his
brain
was
nearly
distracted
but
would
he
privately
watch
her
ways
whom
of
all
others
in
the
wide
wide
world
he
had
looked
upon
as
nearest
perfection
no
he
would
not
thus
debase
himself
it
was
at
a
much
earlier
hour
than
that
which
santon
had
named
that
delwood
presented
himself
and
handsomely
feeing
the
porter
who
answered
his
summons
he
asked
to
see
miss
santon
and
james
said
he
you
need
mention
my
presence
to
no
other
member
of
the
family
as
my
business
is
strictly
private
for
miss
santon
ear
alone
yes
sir
replied
james
twisting
his
face
info
a
most
knowing
wink
as
he
smiled
upon
the
yellow
ore
i
been
there
before
winnie
soon
made
her
appearance
with
no
little
astonishment
pictured
in
her
countenance
that
delwood
should
have
honored
them
with
what
she
termed
a
sunrise
call
and
that
he
should
have
asked
for
her
in
particular
was
a
matter
more
mysterious
his
manners
so
unlike
himself
served
to
check
at
once
her
flow
of
spirits
which
in
spite
of
the
weight
of
oppression
which
had
marked
the
last
year
would
find
vent
if
not
in
a
witty
remark
in
the
expression
of
her
speaking
countenance
was
it
visible
but
she
was
not
slow
to
discern
that
some
serious
subject
was
upon
his
mind
and
became
serious
also
in
a
few
words
he
informed
her
of
what
he
had
learned
from
santon
the
day
previous
but
what
was
his
astonishment
to
find
her
totally
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
not
hesitating
to
declare
the
whole
a
base
falsehood
i
had
not
a
doubt
of
the
falsity
of
the
report
said
delwood
but
what
can
have
given
rise
to
such
a
statement
surely
your
mother
would
not
wish
to
injure
my
feelings
by
repeating
what
may
have
originated
without
foundation
among
the
servants
and
which
she
could
not
have
herself
credited
winnie
saw
the
truth
at
once
knowing
as
she
did
the
character
of
her
whom
if
she
had
ever
looked
upon
as
a
mother
must
from
this
moment
forfeit
every
claim
upon
her
feelings
unless
it
were
that
of
utter
contempt
delwood
said
she
raising
herself
to
her
full
height
her
slender
fingers
clenched
together
every
nerve
to
action
if
you
would
not
insult
me
never
again
call
the
woman
who
has
had
the
heart
to
cast
such
a
slur
upon
the
character
of
her
whom
we
know
is
innocent
it
is
not
to
injure
your
feelings
that
she
has
invented
such
a
vile
scheme
but
it
is
by
injuring
natalie
character
in
your
eyes
she
may
banish
from
her
heart
all
future
happiness
nay
do
not
start
at
such
a
strange
declaration
from
my
lips
you
are
the
only
person
out
of
my
father
household
who
has
a
suspicion
that
our
happiness
is
not
what
it
once
was
but
since
it
has
come
to
this
i
will
at
the
risk
of
disclosing
to
the
world
what
it
were
wisdom
to
conceal
establish
the
innocent
and
rest
assured
that
what
i
say
is
true
this
originated
not
among
the
servants
for
there
is
not
one
but
would
kneel
and
kiss
the
very
ground
upon
which
our
dear
treads
delwood
was
thunderstruck
indeed
i
never
could
have
mistrusted
santon
character
was
so
vile
said
he
but
i
can
sooner
believe
this
than
that
darkness
is
born
of
light
and
has
miss
grosvenor
suffered
the
of
this
cruel
cruel
woman
and
never
lisped
a
word
but
should
lead
others
to
respect
her
noble
girl
that
she
is
thrice
noble
have
these
very
evil
designings
proved
her
is
useless
for
intrigue
to
cope
with
purity
and
she
bade
you
come
and
see
for
yourself
what
meaning
is
there
in
that
asked
winnie
for
surely
such
an
act
would
go
to
prove
her
innocence
if
santon
can
stoop
to
the
deed
which
fortunately
has
been
disclosed
in
time
to
prevent
the
affair
from
coming
to
miss
knowledge
she
would
not
hesitate
to
do
a
meaner
thing
favorable
to
the
furtherance
of
her
plans
and
it
is
my
opinion
there
is
more
to
be
learned
in
regard
to
this
matter
i
will
foil
her
by
following
her
own
advice
and
at
the
appointed
hour
will
station
myself
as
desired
not
as
a
spy
upon
her
ways
but
that
i
may
sift
this
affair
to
the
bottom
accordingly
at
the
hour
which
santon
had
mentioned
summons
were
answered
by
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
in
person
who
smilingly
drew
him
to
the
conservatory
which
overlooked
the
where
he
could
unobserved
by
any
one
notice
every
movement
of
her
whose
very
being
was
dearer
than
his
own
natalie
was
performing
his
favorite
air
and
as
he
listened
he
gradually
lost
sight
of
the
object
of
his
visit
engulfed
in
the
ocean
of
bliss
which
her
impassioned
tones
had
spread
before
him
when
he
was
recalled
to
a
sense
of
outward
circumstances
by
the
voice
of
the
signor
who
as
the
trill
of
her
voice
died
away
sprang
to
his
feet
and
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
passion
exclaimed
never
and
was
about
to
leave
the
house
when
delwood
intercepted
him
in
the
hall
and
taking
him
by
the
collar
demanded
to
know
the
cause
of
his
strange
conduct
the
signor
in
his
peculiar
dialect
replied
do
not
detain
me
sir
it
were
far
better
that
none
should
ever
know
of
the
temptation
which
made
me
a
villain
you
do
not
leave
this
house
sir
until
you
disclose
to
me
what
may
concern
my
welfare
and
do
not
i
pray
you
sir
force
me
to
treat
you
as
other
than
a
gentleman
for
if
i
mistake
not
you
are
yet
worthy
of
respect
you
do
me
proud
sir
but
i
would
much
prefer
to
keep
my
own
tongue
for
should
it
come
to
the
ear
of
madam
that
her
secret
is
a
secret
no
longer
i
fear
it
may
prove
an
injury
to
my
professional
duties
remember
that
i
have
said
sir
you
do
not
leave
this
house
until
you
have
given
me
an
account
of
your
strange
conduct
but
in
doing
thus
if
i
find
you
undeserving
of
censure
it
shall
be
no
sacrifice
to
your
reputation
i
will
pledge
myself
that
you
lose
nothing
since
you
are
determined
sir
i
will
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
said
the
signor
dashing
several
pieces
of
gold
upon
the
floor
there
sir
is
indeed
the
root
of
all
evil
that
gold
was
placed
in
my
hands
by
a
woman
who
would
make
me
a
tool
for
the
carrying
out
of
designs
which
i
have
not
the
heart
to
perform
well
madam
for
some
cause
has
an
under
current
of
thought
which
does
not
appear
to
be
in
keeping
with
the
more
open
sentiments
of
this
family
for
that
amount
of
gold
she
connived
with
me
to
express
such
sentiments
toward
miss
grosvenor
as
should
fire
you
with
a
belief
of
her
inconstancy
and
an
attachment
for
myself
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
be
bought
with
gold
but
she
doubling
the
amount
i
at
last
yielded
to
what
thank
god
i
have
not
had
strength
to
perform
had
it
been
other
than
miss
grosvenor
whom
i
was
to
injure
i
tremble
for
my
weakness
in
resisting
so
great
a
temptation
but
she
reminds
me
too
strongly
of
the
tear
which
i
have
seen
in
my
mother
eye
when
she
prayed
for
her
baby
boy
no
sir
thrice
that
paltry
amount
should
not
tempt
me
now
to
such
degradation
you
have
done
well
sir
said
delwood
calmly
as
he
placed
double
the
amount
of
santon
bribe
in
the
signor
hand
you
have
done
well
sir
and
mark
my
words
gold
can
never
relieve
a
guilty
conscience
go
sir
and
see
that
you
lisp
not
a
syllable
of
this
to
any
one
delwood
was
about
to
take
his
leave
when
he
was
met
by
winnie
who
tripped
lightly
in
fresh
from
a
morning
walk
he
grasped
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
saying
you
have
helped
to
do
away
with
the
sinful
impressions
which
did
their
best
to
fasten
themselves
upon
me
you
will
never
be
forgotten
by
me
and
i
know
you
will
do
your
best
to
protect
from
the
wiles
of
this
woman
of
whose
deeds
the
world
shall
through
me
be
none
the
wiser
i
should
be
did
i
not
strive
to
make
her
happy
for
it
is
in
pity
for
my
father
and
his
motherless
child
that
she
consents
to
be
separated
from
her
own
loved
family
santon
had
never
the
impudence
to
inquire
in
what
way
this
matter
terminated
but
she
could
see
that
her
machinations
had
been
foiled
as
day
after
day
brought
delwood
a
welcome
visitor
to
the
house
yet
this
defeat
did
not
subdue
her
bitter
feelings
towards
the
they
only
slumbered
to
break
out
afresh
on
the
first
occasion
that
might
present
natalie
had
observed
the
signor
abrupt
departure
she
knew
that
something
must
be
amiss
and
questioning
winnie
in
the
matter
she
disclosed
to
her
what
never
came
to
the
ear
of
santon
i
forgive
her
said
the
and
i
can
pity
her
for
perhaps
she
has
never
had
dear
friends
who
might
teach
her
how
to
love

said
the
handing
natalie
a
letter
which
she
was
not
long
in
discovering
was
from
her
dear
mother
i
thank
you
most
heartily
said
she
in
her
low
musical
voice
which
caused
the
youthful
sprig
of
uncle
sam
department
to
leave
incomplete
the
angle
of
degrees
which
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
considering
as
of
no
little
importance
in
the
perfecting
of
his
duties
as
he
went
his
daily
rounds
zounds
said
he
to
himself
as
he
went
whistling
up
the
street
if
i
do
hope
they
send
down
another
document
to
her
soon
and
his
eyes
wandered
up
to
the
little
patch
of
blue
sky
which
was
to
be
seen
between
the
tops
of
brick
walls
the
perused
the
letter
and
sat
apparently
buried
in
deep
thought
why
natie
darling
exclaimed
winnie
as
she
came
bounding
into
the
room
what
has
given
you
such
a
wise
look
this
morning
a
letter
eh
good
news
i
trust
far
be
the
day
which
shall
bring
to
you
aught
but
happiness
thank
you
thank
you
winnie
for
your
good
wishes
but
i
can
not
well
conceive
of
any
other
than
pleasure
coming
from
my
gentle
mother
pen
winnie
ran
her
fingers
lightly
over
the
keys
of
the
piano
and
natalie
did
not
suspect
as
she
listened
to
her
sprightly
air
that
there
was
a
bright
tear
glistening
in
her
eye
at
the
holy
name
of
mother
but
you
are
unusually
thoughtful
natalie
said
winnie
running
her
taper
fingers
through
the
sunny
tresses
of
her
friend
did
i
not
know
it
were
an
impossibility
i
should
say
you
had
lost
your
best
friend
and
putting
her
dimpled
mouth
close
to
her
ear
she
whispered
some
mysterious
words
so
softly
so
very
softly
that
were
we
disposed
to
turn
listener
we
could
only
have
distinguished
that
one
word
delwood
but
we
might
have
seen
the
delicate
tinge
of
pink
which
like
overspread
the
face
and
neck
of
the
be
that
as
it
may
there
was
a
thoughtful
look
lingering
about
those
expressive
features
which
could
even
be
traced
when
at
a
step
was
heard
echoing
with
no
unpleasant
sound
along
the
corridor
and
a
hand
which
though
of
feminine
delicacy
could
have
been
fired
with
sufficient
nerve
to
have
wielded
a
giant
weapon
at
the
invader
who
should
come
between
him
and
the
gentle
being
whose
hand
was
not
withdrawn
as
he
held
it
reverently
within
his
own
ah
miss
said
delwood
as
he
gazed
deep
into
her
eyes
you
are
far
away
among
the
invisible
sprites
of
ocean
are
you
not
one
thought
for
us
poor
unfortunates
who
are
so
ungenial
to
those
translucent
ones
as
never
to
have
been
initiated
to
their
fairy
haunts
really
i
must
get
up
a
little
smile
at
your
expense
for
you
could
not
better
please
an
artist
in
the
composing
of
your
features
if
you
were
sitting
for
your
picture
by
the
way
have
you
seen
the
famous
madonna
whose
great
beauty
is
the
theme
of
all
conversation
i
am
told
it
is
a
by
some
gentleman
who
appears
not
anxious
that
his
brilliant
artistical
powers
shall
be
published
as
his
name
never
accompanies
his
works
and
the
piece
in
question
was
but
by
accident
brought
to
public
view
it
hangs
among
others
in
his
fine
gallery
of
paintings
and
is
hung
with
a
heavy
drapery
of
black
which
was
by
chance
removed
by
a
gentleman
a
friend
of
mine
who
offered
a
handsome
fortune
at
once
for
the
prize
but
his
rich
offer
was
declined
by
the
owner
who
to
the
gentleman
earnest
desire
that
he
might
become
its
possessor
replied
that
bit
of
inanimate
canvas
is
all
upon
which
my
weary
life
feeds
were
you
to
offer
me
the
wealth
of
the
world
i
would
not
part
with
that
one
small
picture
neither
can
i
be
wrought
upon
to
produce
a
copy
of
the
same
without
violating
feelings
which
are
sacred
whether
this
is
a
fancy
piece
or
if
it
bears
the
semblance
of
some
one
of
his
kindred
my
friend
did
not
inform
me
as
he
said
his
very
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
as
the
sad
artist
spoke
those
few
words
i
have
not
myself
seen
this
wonder
and
whether
i
might
be
thus
warm
in
my
praises
is
a
question
as
you
know
i
am
insensible
to
female
beauty
if
i
may
judge
by
remarks
which
from
time
to
time
have
come
to
my
ear
in
past
years
from
estimable
mothers
whose
beautiful
daughters
ought
to
have
called
forth
my
glowing
sentiments
that
which
is
wanting
can
not
be
numbered
said
he
stealing
an
arch
glance
at
natalie
i
have
not
seen
this
painting
replied
natalie
her
countenance
lighting
up
with
a
new
thought
but
i
have
several
times
visited
the
artist
rooms
though
i
have
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
get
sight
of
the
mysterious
connoisseur
those
who
have
met
him
describe
him
as
being
a
gentleman
of
foreign
birth
very
marked
in
his
polite
graceful
manners
yet
there
appears
to
be
a
great
mystery
hanging
about
him
and
some
have
ventured
to
remark
that
his
is
no
common
history
that
he
is
not
merely
what
he
pretends
an
obscure
artist
there
is
that
about
his
bearing
which
denotes
high
birth
i
have
admired
his
talent
displayed
and
must
see
this
remarkable
production
for
you
know
i
am
a
great
admirer
of
female
beauty
that
night
natalie
mused
over
the
events
of
the
day
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
she
had
received
were
first
in
her
mind
her
mother
had
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
see
her
child
once
more
among
other
things
she
had
briefly
made
mention
of
a
matter
in
regard
to
their
pecuniary
affairs
quite
a
little
sum
of
the
comfortable
fortune
which
capt
grosvenor
had
by
dint
of
the
many
perils
at
sea
accumulated
had
been
lost
in
a
recent
bank
failure
a
failure
as
grosvenor
stated
which
had
proved
a
source
of
poverty
to
many
a
family
upon
their
little
island
many
a
widow
had
been
obliged
to
part
with
the
last
dollar
which
had
been
earned
by
the
seafaring
husband
who
had
never
returned
to
share
the
benefit
of
his
labors
their
whole
community
had
been
more
or
less
affected
by
this
failure
as
to
grosvenor
own
loss
she
had
said
it
was
not
heavy
or
at
least
she
had
spoken
of
it
as
not
resting
heavily
upon
her
spirits
why
then
should
the
thoughts
dwell
thus
upon
the
matter
she
still
mused
i
fear
this
may
have
been
a
heavier
loss
than
the
gentle
words
so
characteristic
of
my
mother
tenderness
for
me
may
imply
she
would
not
if
it
were
in
her
power
to
prevent
have
me
feel
that
i
must
curtail
my
expenses
in
the
least
and
i
know
that
my
necessary
expenses
here
must
be
a
great
tax
upon
her
income
to
be
sure
harry
has
often
said
that
our
dear
mother
shall
never
know
what
it
is
to
want
but
for
all
that
i
feel
that
i
might
do
something
to
repay
my
mother
for
all
that
she
has
done
for
me
yes
it
is
my
duty
and
it
certainly
would
be
a
duty
of
pleasure
if
i
could
do
anything
to
assist
her
this
it
was
which
had
caused
the
thoughtful
expression
of
the
this
which
had
called
forth
the
ever
ready
wit
of
miss
winnie
had
detained
delwood
gaze
but
what
would
be
the
sentiment
of
uppertendom
when
it
should
be
rumored
that
the
beautiful
young
creature
of
the
proud
clarence
delwood
choice
had
stooped
so
low
as
to
maintain
herself
by
her
own
hands
how
would
delwood
himself
receive
such
an
announcement
such
thoughts
did
not
occur
to
the
mind
of
the
noble
hearted
girl
her
every
thought
and
act
were
of
good
and
she
did
not
for
once
think
that
there
were
those
who
could
sneer
at
good
motives
ah
natalie
this
is
a
cold
unfeeling
world
at
best
as
experience
of
long
years
doth
confirm
thy
little
day
hath
not
yet
taught
thee
that
the
world
is
born
of
sin
for
thou
only
lookest
on
the
human
face
as
divine
how
natalie
was
to
render
assistance
to
her
mother
by
relieving
her
of
any
incumbrance
of
which
she
herself
might
be
the
cause
had
not
yet
been
matured
until
delwood
had
spoken
of
the
popular
of
the
unknown
artist
when
as
we
have
said
her
face
was
lit
up
with
a
new
thought
i
will
seek
this
gentleman
and
it
may
be
that
he
can
be
induced
to
bring
out
the
dormant
powers
which
i
am
persuaded
are
in
existence
for
my
love
for
his
department
of
the
fine
arts
knows
no
bounds
i
will
visit
him
this
veil
of
mystery
would
seem
a
barrier
yet
perhaps
it
is
of
sadness
and
i
can
conceive
that
such
are
of
the
tender
hearted
alive
to
another
wants
want
she
repeated
aloud
it
sounded
strangely
upon
her
ear
and
indeed
we
can
not
couple
the
thought
with
such
as
she
can
such
fair
ones
of
earth
meet
with
the
chilling
breath
of
adversity
yes
we
may
meet
with
them
in
our
wanderings
let
us
deal
with
them
tenderly
for
it
may
be
one
of
heaven
sensitive
flowers
stranger
still
would
that
word
have
sounded
to
grosvenor
and
her
son
in
connection
with
their
yet
it
was
remotest
from
their
minds
that
such
thoughts
would
find
their
way
to
her
heart
grosvenor
circumstances
were
indeed
more
embarrassed
than
she
had
expressed
to
natalie
yet
she
had
sufficient
left
wherewith
they
might
by
retrenching
a
little
live
very
comfortably
accordingly
that
natalie
might
not
feel
this
change
she
had
dismissed
her
only
servant
if
we
may
do
honor
to
old
vingo
by
dubbing
him
with
a
more
elevated
appellation
making
some
other
restrictions
in
her
domestic
affairs
for
the
sake
of
the
child
whom
she
knew
was
not
her
own
by
kindred
doing
away
with
what
she
persuaded
herself
were
but
unnecessary
indulgences
faithful
mother
thou
wilt
have
thy
reward
natalie
arose
the
next
morning
refreshed
by
the
sweet
repose
which
innocence
only
knows
and
although
the
day
was
ushered
in
with
clouds
and
an
occasional
she
proceeded
to
put
into
execution
the
plans
of
yesterday
she
had
made
no
one
a
confidant
of
her
designs
not
even
winnie
and
when
that
little
lady
met
her
in
the
hall
all
armed
and
equipped
as
the
weather
directed
she
exclaimed
where
now
miss
are
you
going
to
temper
your
indissolvable
charms
to
an
april
shower
or
is
it
to
hunt
up
some
poor
little
refugee
who
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
minus
an
umbrella
that
you
are
so
bereft
of
your
senses
as
to
venture
out
afoot
and
alone
this
disagreeable
morning
neither
the
one
nor
yet
the
other
my
fair
sister
joyously
replied
the
and
she
tripped
down
the
steps
smiling
upon
the
little
frightened
which
fell
lightly
upon
her
from
the
skies
not
offering
to
treat
them
with
such
indecorum
as
the
spreading
of
her
umbrella
and
when
winnie
called
to
her
to
come
back
or
if
she
would
venture
forth
to
take
the
carriage
she
was
far
out
of
hearing
arrived
at
her
point
of
natalie
was
so
lost
in
admiration
of
the
noble
illustrations
of
the
infinite
mind
of
man
that
she
had
lost
sight
of
her
object
in
visiting
the
unknown
artist
until
she
was
awakened
from
her
revery
by
a
voice
near
her
and
looking
she
discovered
a
poor
dejected
looking
old
negro
woman
kneeling
with
her
hands
clasped
together
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
natalie
followed
in
the
direction
it
must
be
the
beautiful
madonna
of
which
she
had
heard
involuntarily
she
assumed
the
position
of
the
negress
what
visions
filled
her
soul
flitting
to
and
fro
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
rushed
in
mingled
indistinctness
through
her
mind
and
over
the
chaos
there
floated
a
calm
which
gradually
took
the
form
of
recollections
which
now
caused
her
heart
to
beat
loudly
with
the
uncertainty
fraught
with
reality
night
came
fresh
again
to
her
memory
when
she
had
overheard
her
brother
words
she
is
not
my
sister
by
birth
the
same
holy
passions
filled
her
soul
and
she
gazed
upon
that
face
the
semblance
of
which
she
had
many
a
time
ere
now
looked
upon
in
dreams
might
they
not
have
been
waking
dreams
god
grant
dat
such
as
she
neber
know
what
it
am
to
be
torn
from
her
childer
groaned
the
black
woman
with
a
sigh
ah
my
poor
woman
said
natalie
her
eyes
still
fixed
upon
that
spiritual
face
i
trust

been

said
the
woman
drawing
a
parcel
from
her
bosom
carefully
unfolding
it
and
holding
a
large
red
handkerchief
up
to
view
if

tinks

all
one
great
heaben
but
what
is
this
mark
upon
the
handkerchief
asked
natalie
for
she
had
seen
a
of
the
little
device
upon
old
vingo
bandanna
which
he
used
to
lend
her
when
she
was
a
child
and
she
had
handled
it
so
carefully
because
he
had
told
her
that
it
was
the
most
valuable
thing
he
owned
in
the
world
beside
his
bible
and
she
had
looked
up
into
his
face
with
her
great
blue
eyes
and
asked
him
what
the
two
little
crooked
marks
were
made
to
represent
and
he
had
told
her
they
were
to
represent
himself
and
his
poor
phillis
for
they
were
bent
with
the
sorrows
of
the
world
and
now
here
were
the
same
crooked
marks
wrought
upon
the
corner
of
this
black
woman
handkerchief
which
she
seemed
to
treasure
so
much
what
could
it
mean
natalie
looked
upon
it
in
astonishment
where
did
you
get
this
she
asked
my
poor
ole
man
gabe
it
to
me
de
last

dat

and
do

asked
natalie
without
betraying
her
emotion
at
such
a
discovery
oh
missy
if
he
know
anyting
about
heaven
i
might
to
meet

good
woman
you

spirit
for
your
oppressors
and
thank
god
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
make
two
of
my
fellow
mortals
happy
what
should
you
say
if
i
were
to
tell
you
where
you
may
find
your
husband
the
woman
looked
at
her
without
speaking
a
word
your
husband
is
alive
and
well
and
faithful
old
vingo
is
at
this
moment
in
my
mother
family
where
his
wants
spiritual
and
temporal
are
cared
for
and
he
has
often
told
me
if
he
could
but
once
again
see
his
wife
phillis
he
should
die
happy
the
woman
gave
one
long
piercing
cry
and
sank
upon
the
floor
at
this
instant
the
artist
issued
from
an
adjoining
apartment
and
stood
gazing
upon
the
scene
my
god
what
do
i
see
exclaimed
the
gentleman
in
a
voice
which
instantly
riveted
the
attention
upon
him
tell
me
in
mercy
tell
me
who
thou
art
and
he
leaned
against
a
column
for
support
had
natalie
been
heir
to
that
weakness
which
is
somewhat
characteristic
of
the
gentler
sex
she
might
have
been
terrified
at
such
deep
impassioned
language
from
a
perfect
stranger
trembling
with
the
certainty
that
she
stood
face
to
face
with
a
lunatic
but
no
such
fear
was
hers
advancing
she
bowed
low
in
honor
to
his
superior
age
saying
pardon
me
if
i
am
an
intruder
here
yet
sir
an
apology
is
needless
for
who
can
resist
the
grace
and
beauty
which
is
here
displayed
my
presence
sir
has
evidently
disturbed
you
and
if
you
will
permit
me
to
ask
one
question
i
will
retire
the
madonna
that
face
of
an
angel
is
she
the
pure
production
of
your
own
soul
or
can
it
be
that
such
as
she
has
indeed
been
amongst
us
she
has
been
and
has
passed
away
has
passed
away
he
repeated
to
himself
i
never
thought
to
meet
her
again
until
the
dark
river
had
been
crossed
but
what
do
i
see
and
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
were
not
dreaming
no
it
was
no
dream
a
gentle
living
form
stood
before
him
who
had
sorrowed
for
his
only
child
nearly
twenty
long
years
and
was
devoutly
regarding
those
inanimate
features
to
which
his
soul
had
clung
as
if
it
were
of
life
and
his
eye
now
wandered
from
the
animate
to
the
inanimate
the
beauteous
countenance
of
the
madonna
it
was
not
unlike
that
of
the
the
features
were
the
same
regaining
his
composure
the
artist
proceeded
in
a
peculiarly
mellow
tone
of
voice
dear
lady
you
will
pardon
my
seemingly
reception
of
you
i
know
when
you
have
heard
what
has
never
yet
passed
my
lips
to
any
mortal
near
twenty
years
have
expired
since
i
left
my
cherished
home
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
and
came
to
america
i
met
with
sorrow
at
an
early
age
the
young
wife
of
my
choice
was
taken
from
me
and
i
should
have
been
overwhelmed
with
grief
had
not
the
precious
boon
left
to
me
by
her
claimed
my
love
the
beautiful
babe
smiled
upon
me
and
i
felt
rebuked
in
spirit
that
i
should
thus
murmur
at
will
when
in
his
loving
kindness
he
had
spared
to
me
this
her
very
likeness
and
i
came
to
smile
again
i
could
then
smile
upon
his
chastening
rod
but
and
a
deep
shudder
thrilled
his
frame
i
have
since
been
led
to
ask
myself
if
there
is
a
god
o
can
a
good
god
thus
afflict
his
children
pause
sir
i
beseech
you
ere
you
give
utterance
to
such
dreadful
thoughts
think
of
the
countless
mercies
which
you
have
received
at
his
hand
weigh
them
well
in
a
balance
with
your
sorrows
whatever
they
may
have
been
and
you
will
find
the
measure
of
your
blessings
tenfold
your
words
are
as
balm
to
my
calloused
heart
yet
listen
to
me
and
judge
if
my
cruel
fate
would
not
engender
a
dark
distrust
in
a
purer
heart
than
mine
my
child
grew
in
strength
and
beauty
grew
to
be
like
her
who
had
left
us
she
was
the
pride
of
my
luxuriant
home
the
main
spring
of
my
life
yes
i
could
realize
it
then
while
i
could
yet
gaze
upon
her
face
and
dream
of
heaven
but
other
days
drew
near
it
was
in
her
twentieth
year
when
my
natalie
knelt
before
the
altar
a
bride
she
had
given
her
hand
to
a
american
gentleman
upon
whom
i
looked
as
being
worthy
of
my
darling
choice
and
as
she
placed
one
hand
within
his
she
took
the
hand
of
her
father
with
the
other
and
whispered
now
give
your
daughter
to
another
yet
it
shall
only
serve
to
bind
me
still
closer
to
my
father
i
was
happy
then
and
when
two
years
later
i
pressed
my
daughter
to
my
heart
and
bade
her
adieu
for
the
first
time
without
a
thought
that
it
might
be
the
last
i
was
happy
and
when
i
pressed
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
of
her
infant
child
and
grasped
the
hand
of
my
noble
son
her
husband
i
was
happy
for
so
full
was
my
cup
of
joy
that
i
had
forgotten
the
drop
of
bitterness
which
i
had
tasted
therefrom
but
alas
it
was
not
so
full
to
overflowing
that
there
was
not
room
for
the
draught
that
was
to
be
my
portion
they
sailed
for
america
to
visit
his
home
when
after
the
settlement
of
his
estate
in
this
western
world
they
would
return
to
make
glad
their
father
home
that
day
has
not
yet
come
a
year
elapsed
and
i
had
no
tidings
of
them
yet
i
would
not
permit
the
thought
to
dwell
with
me
that
i
should
never
hear
from
them
more
and
another
year
passed
on
before
the
despair
entered
my
soul
which
has
been
to
me
a
burning
flame
ever
since
i
gave
my
possessions
to
the
keeping
of
another
and
left
my
native
italy
to
cross
the
deep
if
i
might
learn
of
the
fate
of
my
children
i
went
to
the
place
he
had
told
me
was
his
home
but
i
met
with
only
strangers
there
i
inquired
for
the
noble
vessel
in
which
my
child
had
sailed
she
had
not
belonged
on
this
coast
and
thus
were
my
earnest
inquiries
repulsed
day
after
day
with
a
heartless
can
give
you
no
information
i
travelled
from
place
to
place
in
hopes
to
get
some
clue
to
the
mystery
which
hung
around
my
lost
ones
but
alas
that
was
not
to
be
i
sought
in
vain
it
was
then
a
change
came
over
me
i
hardly
knew
myself
i
concealed
my
name
and
lived
a
recluse
never
disclosing
to
any
one
the
history
of
my
sorrows
but
i
could
not
live
thus
and
i
endeavored
to
divert
my
mind
from
this
state
of
frenzy
by
making
use
of
the
talent
for
which
in
my
heart
of
stone
i
would
not
thank
my
god
for
bestowing
upon
me
and
so
i
have
lived
as
you
find
me
unknown
artist
it
is
needless
to
add
the
beautiful
madonna
which
was
never
designed
for
the
rude
gaze
of
public
curiosity
is
the
likeness
of
my
child
and
though
i
had
no
other
than
the
impress
of
her
features
upon
my
heart
to
guide
my
trembling
hand
yet
i
have
got
a
soul
upon
that
canvas
sometimes
i
have
fancied
that
some
good
angel
had
not
forgotten
me
and
had
breathed
soul
into
those
pure
eyes
and
the
child
asked
natalie
in
a
suppressed
breath
scarcely
above
a
whisper
her
child
was
but
a
tiny
babe
her
features
were
not
sufficiently
developed
to
leave
its
memory
on
my
mind
yet
they
told
me
the
little
creature
was
like
her
mother
this
the
madonna
child
is
from
life
in
my
wanderings
i
visited
the
island
of
nantucket
i
spent
some
little
time
there
as
i
found
the
great
hearts
of
those
people
more
congenial
to
my
weary
spirits
than
the
chilling
air
of
avarice
which
in
a
measure
marks
this
western
world
one
morning
as
i
strolled
along
the
shore
looking
out
upon
the
sea
depressed
in
spirits
i
observed
a
pretty
sight
not
far
from
me
an
old
negro
sat
upon
the
beach
and
by
his
side
an
infant
some
eighteen
months
old
with
her
arms
clasped
about
the
neck
of
a
large
newfoundland
dog
while
her
eyes
which
were
of
the
blue
of
heaven
were
fixed
upon
the
waves
which
rolled
and
broke
in
harmless
ripples
at
her
feet
she
was
a
beauteous
child
i
have
never
seen
another
upon
whom
i
could
look
as
the
little
angel
that
had
gone
i
traced
her
beautiful
features
as
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
have
pencil
and
paper
by
me
and
was
about
to
pass
on
when
i
observed
the
brother
of
the
child
approaching
he
was
a
noble
little
fellow
with
the
air
of
a
young
prince
and
i
never
shall
forget
his
proud
answer
when
i
asked
him
of
his
sister
call
her
sir
for
she
came
to
us
from
god
and
he
smiles
upon
each
little
flower
as
it
lifts
up
its
head
all
trembling
with
dew
i
breathed
a
blessing
upon
them
both
for
they
had
drawn
a
tear
from
my
heart
of
stone
sir
said
natalie
as
he
paused
nantucket
is
my
home
often
have
i
listened
to
my
dear
brother
as
he
has
told
me
the
pretty
story
of
the
sad
gentleman
whom
he
met
when
i
was
but
an
infant
and
how
he
spoke
to
me
so
tenderly
and
sighed
for
his
own
natalie
i
had
no
other
name
then
but
and
i
have
been
called
by
that
name
ever
since
yet
after
that
day
my
christian
name
was
natalie
the
artist
gazed
upon
her
and
pointing
to
the
madonna
exclaimed
thou
art
the
child
you
are
like
the
madonna
can
it
be
that
i
have
unconsciously
restored
to
the
mother
her
child
none
other
than
her
own
could
thus
resemble
her
in
my
innermost
heart
there
has
ever
dwelt
a
mystery
which
i
can
find
no
language
to
describe
in
my
dreams
i
have
had
sweet
visions
of
a
beauteous
being
who
has
smiled
upon
me
and
made
me
happy
the
madonna
awakens
all
those
pure
feelings
and
i
can
not
but
look
upon
her
as
in
some
way
connected
with
my
being
yet
my
own
mother
lives
and
my
affection
for
her
is
as
for
no
other
being
upon
the
earth
is
in
heaven
mused
the
artist
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
who
should
enter
but
clarence
delwood
who
was
much
surprised
to
find
natalie
thus
unattended
in
earnest
conversation
with
the
mysterious
artist
she
arose
as
he
entered
and
presented
him
to
the
gentleman
but
she
had
not
yet
learned
his
name
the
artist
presented
his
card
to
delwood
assuming
the
same
frigid
manner
which
had
become
his
nature
delwood
gave
one
glance
at
the
madonna
how
is
this
sir
asked
he
in
an
excited
manner
that
you
have
made
use
of
this
lady
face
to
attract
the
notice
of
a
vulgar
public
to
your
works
who
gave
you
authority
for
such
assurance
as
this
sir
calm
yourself
clarence
said
the
mildly
the
gentleman
had
never
seen
me
to
his
knowledge
until
this
morning
it
rather
becomes
us
to
apologize
for
this
intrusion
upon
the
sacred
memory
of
his
child
delwood
listened
with
astonishment
to
the
information
which
we
have
just
learned
and
his
eyes
wandered
from
the
beautiful
madonna
to
the
no
less
beautiful
being
whom
he
hoped
at
no
distant
day
to
call
his
own
while
a
thought
filled
his
soul
with
delight
and
he
said
to
himself
i
knew
that
she
was
infinitely
above
me
though
outward
circumstances
would
make
her
of
no
particular
distinction
yes
there
is
a
meaning
in
this
a
mystery
to
be
solved
who
is
she
this
pure
being
and
your
mother
still
lives
mused
the
artist
do
you
resemble
her
i
am
unlike
any
one
of
my
family
so
much
so
that
strangers
have
noted
it
and
your
father
is
in
heaven
truly
mused
the
gentleman
and
your
sainted
mother
likewise
permit
me
to
ask
your
address
gentle
lady
said
the
artist
as
his
visitors
prepared
to
retire
and
in
return
you
will
allow
me
to
come
every
day
and
look
upon
this
dear
face
you
are
the
only
person
whom
i
have
bade
a
welcome
to
my
presence
for
years
and
bidding
them
a
good
morning
the
artist
retired
to
brood
over
other
than
his
sorrows
it
was
then
that
natalie
remembered
the
poor
black
woman
though
not
a
thought
of
the
object
of
her
own
visit
thither
crossed
her
mind
the
woman
was
silently
contemplating
the
as
if
she
were
an
angel
of
mercy
where
do
you
live
my
good
woman
inquired
natalie
one
spot
am
not
my
home
more
dan
anoder
missy
de
wide
earth
am
my
home
but
tell
me
missy
did
ole
phillis
hear
you
straight
or
am
she
so
warped
troughout
dat
she
hot

de
right
comprehensions
what
i
have
told
you
you
may
rely
upon
come
here
in
a
day
or
two
again
and
you
shall
hear
farther
bress
de
lor
bress
de
good
lor
for
sending
de
bright
angel
shouted
the
woman
as
she
ran
out
of
the
house
throwing
about
her
long
arms
now
freed
from
slavery
chains
and
making
sundry
other
uncouth
manifestations
of
her
joy
so
characteristic
of
her
race
which
caused
a
policeman
to
realize
the
dignity
of
his
station
by
actually
opening
one
eye
and
puffing
diligently
at
the
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
which
encircled
the
other
a
week
later
and
natalie
received
a
letter
from
her
mother
in
reply
to
her
account
of
her
visit
to
the
mysterious
artist
it
ran
thus
my
dear
daughter
it
was
with
joy
mingled
with
a
shade
of
sadness
that
i
perused
your
last
not
that
you
my
innocent
child
could
impart
other
than
pleasure
to
the
meanest
of
weak
mortals
yet
it
brought
afresh
to
my
mind
a
subject
which
though
it
marks
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
my
life
owing
to
peculiar
circumstances
the
memory
of
my
dear
husband
being
closely
associated
therewith
brings
to
my
heart
also
a
shadow
of
grief
that
which
i
would
say
has
to
do
with
yourself
my
daughter
yet
i
can
not
commission
my
pen
to
the
revealing
of
this
secret
i
would
tell
you
with
my
own
lips
of
the
mystery
which
hangs
around
your
birth
for
i
would
seal
the
tale
with
a
kiss
looking
upon
my
for
an
assurance
of
love
undiminished
you
must
now
come
home
to
us
i
can
bear
this
separation
no
longer
the
time
has
come
when
our
dear
little
for
so
many
years
the
sunshine
of
our
home
shall
test
the
strength
of
her
affection
for
those
who
will
ever
regard
her
a
blessing
from
that
heavenly
shore
say
to
the
author
of
the
madonna
and
child
that
i
would
earnestly
wish
that
he
may
accompany
you
home
as
he
may
be
informed
of
that
which
so
nearly
concerns
his
happiness
adieu
my
daughter
until
i
shall
see
you
once
more
from
your
affectionate
mother
natalie
folded
the
letter
and
repeating
aloud
can
i
ever
love
my
mother
less
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
and
wept
the
day
drew
near
when
the
accompanied
by
alboni
for
such
was
the
name
of
the
gentlemanly
artist
and
clarence
delwood
should
seek
her
island
home
this
was
anything
but
a
pleasant
anticipation
for
winnie
for
since
her
mother
death
she
had
learned
to
lean
upon
natalie
though
younger
than
herself
and
had
received
from
her
in
times
of
trial
such
sweet
counsel
as
would
sink
into
her
heart
giving
her
new
strength
making
her
a
wiser
and
a
better
being
in
the
time
which
natalie
had
been
in
the
santon
family
there
had
been
a
perceptible
change
in
the
character
of
the
beautiful
coquettish
heiress
those
blemishes
which
the
faithful
mother
had
discovered
upspringing
in
her
daughter
youthful
heart
marring
her
otherwise
lovable
character
had
been
erased
not
that
she
had
lost
in
any
degree
that
gay
cheery
openness
of
heart
which
we
love
so
well
to
meet
she
was
yet
the
winnie
santon
of
days
which
had
known
no
lowering
skies
the
singing
bird
of
a
june
morning
save
that
an
occasional
plaintive
note
breathed
out
upon
youth
freshness
of
life
realities
it
was
the
last
night
in
which
these
maidens
winnie
and
natalie
might
pour
out
to
each
other
the
fulness
of
their
hearts
the
last
did
we
say
the
last
distance
would
separate
them
ere
another
sunset
and
ocean
would
intervene
yet
we
have
said
the
last
folded
in
each
other
arms
they
sat
in
the
pale
moonlight
each
reading
within
the
other
soul
an
appreciation
of
this
holy
hour
holy
hours
are
they
indeed
which
lead
our
thoughts
far
up
beyond
this
mortal
sphere
pointing
us
to
other
than
earth
vanities
beautiful
yet
so
unlike
they
were
and
ah
what
is
more
beautiful
than
maiden
purity
woman
she
fell
yet
her
name
will
ever
stand
foremost
in
the
ranks
of
all
that
is
exalting
and
who
will
there
be
to
love
me
when
you
are
gone
who
will
talk
with
me
so
gently
and
keep
my
feet
from
the
dangerous
paths
which
surround
me
asked
winnie
as
the
discordant
tones
of
santon
voice
stole
in
upon
their
quietude
from
an
adjoining
apartment
if
there
is
anything
in
this
beautiful
world
of
ours
which
can
make
me
sad
it
is
the
parting
from
those
whom
i
love
yet
i
know
it
is
but
for
a
little
while
dear
winnie
can
you
realize
how
kind
our
father
is
that
he
has
given
us
the
promise
of
a
home
where
there
will
be
no
more
parting
never
a
farewell
and
he
will
guide
your
footsteps
make
him
your
friend
and
though
all
others
should
forsake
you
you
will
be
happy
he
will
be
a
better
friend
to
you
than
ever
i
have
been
and
remember
winnie
dear
when
i
am
gone
should
sorrow
come
to
you
or
bitter
trials
mark
your
way
go
to
our
father
for
counsel
and
he
will
give
you
sweet
rest
thus
did
the
endeavor
to
leave
upon
winnie
heart
that
which
should
prepare
her
for
meeting
the
trials
which
she
but
too
plainly
foresaw
would
be
her
lot
from
the
unmotherly
spirit
evinced
by
santon
blessings
on
thee
noble
girl
would
there
were
more
like
thee
to
be
found
in
this
sinful
world
below
but
what
is
a
blessing
craved
by
the
lips
of
frail
mortal
compared
with
the
seraph
blessings
showered
upon
thy
gentle
head
from
her
who
is
looking
down
upon
her
child
as
thy
voice
is
raised
in
prayer
to
the
god
of
this
motherless
one
that
she
may
find
refuge
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
wing
the
last
farewell
was
spoken
by
poor
winnie
with
an
aching
heart
santon
had
pressed
the
hand
with
a
tear
in
his
eye
as
if
reluctant
to
let
her
go
lest
the
severing
of
one
of
the
last
ties
which
bound
him
to
happy
days
should
be
too
much
for
his
sorrowing
heart
and
she
had
gone
leaving
her
impress
upon
the
hearts
of
all
who
had
met
and
loved
her
her
spirit
was
the
spirit
of
love
forgiving
as
she
hoped
to
be
forgiven
her
sins
which
had
it
not
been
said
of
man
not
one
is
perfect
we
should
have
looked
upon
as
of
no
deeper
stains
than
are
of
the
newly
washen
lambs
gambolling
in
fresh
pastures
of
innocence
even
to
santon
unpardonable
slight
in
not
giving
her
a
parting
salutation
pleading
one
of
her
timely
headaches
as
an
excuse
for
her
at
the
hour
of
separation
the
had
left
for
her
a
kind
farewell
after
an
absence
of
nearly
three
years
natalie
stood
once
again
upon
the
shores
of
her
island
home
everything
was
as
when
she
had
left
for
the
bustle
and
change
of
the
outer
world
does
not
disturb
the
quiet
of
this
isle
her
mother
received
her
with
tears
of
joy
that
fulness
of
joy
which
only
the
mother
can
feel
who
after
a
long
separation
from
the
child
whose
beauty
of
character
sheds
a
halo
of
honor
around
the
household
name
holds
her
to
her
heart
again
where
she
knows
her
to
be
safest
from
the
world
contumely
harry
welcomed
his
sister
home
with
the
wild
delight
of
his
boyish
days
regardless
of
the
presence
of
strangers
in
their
family
circle
while
old
vingo
who
had
been
beside
himself
for
a
week
past
with
the
prospect
of
at
last
actually
beholding
his
missy
face
to
face
capered
about
the
room
as
if
he
were
not
so
near
his
second
childhood
the
pressed
his
bony
black
hand
to
her
lips
ah

but
and
she
spread
out
the
veritable
handkerchief
so
precious
to
the
poor
black
woman
before
his
wondering
eyes
you
are
deserving
of
the
rich
blessings
of
earthly
friends
for

been
tried
as
it
has
been
the
will
of
an
overruling
providence

submissive

added
she
pointing
out
the
crooked
marks
in
the
corner
of
the
handkerchief
do
you
recognize
that
vingo
drew
forth
the
bandanna
which
always
accompanied
him
in
his
wanderings
and
laid
it
by
the
side
of
the
other
they
were
just
alike
there
were
the
two
crooked
marks
upon
each
speaking
as
accurately
as
the
most
highly
finished
ambrotype
of
the
day
praise

i
tink
dat
angels

in
dat
cannibal
hemisphere
it
was
with
difficulty
that
those
who
witnessed
the
fellow
ludicrous
movements
could
refrain
from
a
smile
but
when
at
a
summons
from
natalie
the
door
opened
and
the
black
woman
so
nearly
allied
to
the
human
family
as
to
have
manifested
an
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
stood
before
them
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
room
it
was
an
affecting
sight
to
witness
the
meeting
of
this
man
and
wife
who
had
been
separated
for
so
many
long
years
and
under
such
trying
circumstances
to
be
sure
they
were
poor
ignorant
negroes
who
are
looked
upon
by
a
large
portion
of
the
world
as
only
fit
to
be
ranked
with
dogs
and
other
dumb
animals
yet
they
have
souls
hearts
which
had
been
given
to
christ
and
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
were
he
now
upon
the
earth
would
not
be
ashamed
to
take
this
race
by
the
hand
and
lift
them
up
god
looks
down
from
his
throne
above
with
pitying
eye
he
pities
his
children
we
grow
strong
in
the
assurance
of
his
tender
mercies
but
let
us
remember
he
will
avenge
with
a
powerful
arm
the
wrongs
inflicted
upon
his
feebler
ones
for
he
hath
said
my
children
love
ye
one
another
even
as
your
heavenly
father
loveth
you
this
meeting
of
old
vingo
and
phillis
was
enough
to
have
softened
the
heart
of
the
vilest
legree
but
probably
had
one
of
those
gentlemen
whose
highly
respectable
occupation
it
is
to
deal
in
the
traffic
of
buying
and
selling
man
been
present
they
might
have
been
led
to
remark
the
silly
creatures
seem
to
imagine
they
have
some
feeling
the
evening
shades
descended
the
night
was
wild
and
the
voices
of
the
breakers
rose
loud
as
if
responding
to
the
angry
aspect
of
nature
yet
peace
sat
beneath
the
roof
of
grosvenor
dwelling
the
evening
lamps
were
lit
and
as
grosvenor
produced
a
small
casket
and
laid
it
on
the
she
thought
within
herself
it
was
much
such
a
storm
only
a
few
days
after
our
dear
one
came
to
us
alboni
sat
with
bowed
head
as
the
mother
proceeded
to
bring
forth
evidences
which
should
identify
her
darling
child
as
being
of
the
descent
and
lineage
of
another
line
of
ancestors
than
hers
while
the
her
hand
clasped
within
that
of
him
who
had
found
favor
in
the
mother
eyes
prepared
herself
to
receive
any
information
in
regard
to
her
destiny
which
it
should
be
the
will
of
a
just
god
to
decree
the
tiny
lace
dress
which
the
infant
had
worn
when
she
was
first
placed
in
her
arms
was
held
up
to
view
it
was
of
a
costly
fabric
embroidered
heavily
with
evidently
the
production
of
the
industry
of
some
lone
sister
of
convent
life
the
casket
the
contents
of
which
had
been
so
long
treasured
as
things
sacred
was
opened
and
the
bands
of
gold
placed
in
alboni
hands
he
examined
them
closely
there
were
no
initials
not
the
least
mark
whereby
he
might
learn
of
that
which
was
of
such
vast
interest
to
him
when
lo
he
pressed
the
spring
which
had
before
yielded
to
grosvenor
touch
and
behold
the
same
features
which
he
had
looked
upon
day
by
day
for
twenty
years
were
revealed
to
him
the
features
of
his
madonna
his
child
my
god
exclaimed
he
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
brought
me
from
darkness
to
light
not
only
that
i
may
acknowledge
thy
supremacy
but
to
bless
thee
during
the
brief
remainder
of
my
days
if
i
may
atone
for
my
deep
sin
in
living
so
long
without
thee
even
doubting
thy
existence
this
is
truly
a
convincing
proof
that
thou
art
all
in
all
i
here
vow
that
should
the
gracious
lord
see
fit
to
chasten
his
servant
by
taking
away
this
my
last
support
it
shall
only
serve
to
increase
my
faith
in
the
love
of
my
most
precious
redeemer
and
with
tearful
eyes
the
old
gentleman
held
his
to
his
heart
and
is
it
really
thus
asked
natalie
can
it
be
that
my
mother
has
been
looking
down
upon
me
from
her
home
in
the
skies
your
sainted
mother
is
in
heaven
spake
alboni
the
glanced
towards
her
from
whom
she
had
ever
received
a
mother
tenderness
there
was
a
smile
upon
her
countenance
yet
natalie
observed
though
she
would
fain
be
happy
that
her
loved
one
was
restored
to
her
kindred
undoubtedly
an
advantageous
discovery
in
every
point
of
view
it
was
like
an
arrow
to
her
heart
for
was
she
not
her
child
natalie
arose
and
giving
one
hand
to
her
mother
the
other
to
him
whom
she
would
henceforth
look
upon
as
a
father
she
said
yes
my
own
mother
has
gone
to
her
home
she
is
an
angel
there
where
i
shall
meet
her
at
the
last
but
you
my
mother
can
never
be
less
dear
to
me
i
must
always
look
upon
you
as
my
mother
and
throwing
her
arms
about
grosvenor
neck
she
exclaimed
though
others
shall
claim
me
by
the
ties
of
kindred
they
never
shall
part
me
from
you
your
child
will
never
forsake
you
it
was
enough
the
widowed
mother
was
not
written
childless
then
it
was
that
grosvenor
related
every
minute
particular
in
regard
to
the
child
discovery
and
how
she
had
been
a
blessing
to
them
all
repaying
them
doubly
for
their
care
it
was
a
long
and
interesting
story
to
which
this
little
circle
listened
regardless
of
the
raging
elements
without
with
the
exception
of
the
who
drank
in
every
note
of
nature
mighty
chorus
scarcely
thinking
of
the
perils
to
which
those
who
were
riding
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
might
be
exposed
for
her
young
heart
shrank
not
from
ocean
awe
she
had
always
looked
upon
an
ocean
grave
as
a
hallowed
place
of
burial
and
your
daughter
name
was
natalie
remarked
delwood
it
is
a
singular
coincidence
that
the
child
should
be
named
for
the
mother
it
is
all
a
miracle
said
harry
and
sometimes
i
have
thought
old
vingo
not
far
out
of
the
way
when
he
declared
to
have
been
left
upon
the
beach
by
no
other
than
the
lord
gradually
alboni
came
to
be
like
himself
again
he
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
his
countenance
denoting
his
generosity
of
heart
his
delight
in
the
society
of
the
as
she
pointed
out
to
him
each
day
some
new
attraction
about
her
island
home
knew
no
bounds
it
was
now
that
alboni
directed
his
attention
to
his
unsettled
affairs
in
italy
had
he
lived
out
his
days
as
the
unknown
artist
without
discovering
an
heiress
to
his
vast
estates
he
would
probably
never
have
given
the
subject
a
thought
and
strangers
or
some
public
institution
would
have
realized
a
handsome
legacy
but
his
every
nerve
thrilled
now
with
new
life
for
her
every
advantage
which
wealth
could
procure
would
be
hers
but
it
was
not
only
to
look
after
his
pecuniary
affairs
that
he
laid
the
question
before
grosvenor
if
her
child
should
accompany
him
to
the
land
of
her
birth
but
that
she
might
become
acquainted
with
the
position
in
life
which
she
was
every
way
capable
of
filling
and
so
it
was
arranged
that
natalie
with
her
grandfather
should
make
the
tour
of
the
eastern
world
whither
delwood
should
accompany
them
after
disposing
of
alboni
estates
and
visiting
the
lions
of
the
east
they
would
return
to
make
america
their
home
and
it
being
left
for
natalie
to
decide
what
spot
should
be
chosen
as
their
future
home
she
said
stealing
a
glance
towards
clarence
delwood
we
will
return
to
my
mother
peaceful
island
home
for
we
can
be
happy
here
accordingly
the
day
was
fixed
when
they
should
depart
but
the
very
evening
before
they
would
sail
brought
news
to
delwood
of
the
dangerous
and
probably
fatal
illness
of
his
father
it
was
with
a
sad
heart
that
he
looked
upon
such
a
separation
from
his
betrothed
for
he
would
necessarily
resign
the
pleasure
which
he
had
anticipated
in
escorting
her
to
countries
which
he
had
visited
and
which
had
become
dear
to
him
it
was
a
great
disappointment
also
to
natalie
yet
she
sought
to
persuade
him
it
was
for
the
best
she
would
soon
return
and
the
separation
would
bring
a
thrice
joyful
meeting
it
was
a
glorious
evening
the
soft
moonlight
kissed
the
white
as
each
strove
to
lift
its
head
above
its
fellows
as
if
to
gaze
upon
night
purity
or
mayhap
they
would
beckon
that
gentle
one
who
smiled
upon
their
wild
joy
as
she
reclined
upon
her
lover
breast
to
join
them
in
their
revellings
upon
the
broad
bank
of
the
old
south
shore
they
sat
a
favorite
resort
of
the
youth
and
maidens
of
this
little
island
of
a
eve
old
sankoty
to
the
eastward
lifting
high
his
head
imparting
a
flood
of
radiance
in
pity
to
thousands
who
watch
with
an
intensity
to
make
the
light
rejoicing
no
less
when
they
have
left
it
far
behind
for
well
do
they
realize
that
they
have
passed
one
of
the
most
dangerous
shoals
to
be
found
on
the
american
coast
behind
them
distance
about
three
miles
is
the
town
there
is
no
din
and
bustle
borne
on
the
night
air
to
their
ears
naught
is
heard
but
the
moaning
voice
of
the
night
wind
mingled
with
the
ceaseless
roar
of
the
ocean
here
far
from
the
contumely
no
eye
to
see
no
ear
to
hear
save
that
of
him
who
is
omnipresent
were
those
vows
of
love
renewed
and
registered
above
many
a
fair
maiden
has
here
since
plighted
her
faith
here
given
her
hand
to
the
loved
one
of
her
choice
heaven
bless
the
union
of
nantucket
fair
ones
yet
the
night
has
never
since
looked
down
upon
two
of
more
perfect
oneness
of
heart
than
those
of
whom
this
serene
night
bore
witness
and
will
you
still
retain
your
asked
delwood
or
will
you
travel
under
your
grandfather
italian
name
by
the
way
i
have
not
heard
the
name
of
your
father
paul
sunderland
was
my
father
name
sunderland
the
lady
sunderland
i
have
seen
your
mother
natalie
exclaimed
he
it
was
none
other
than
she
the
kind
beautiful
lady
who
sang
to
me
when
i
was
but
a
child
in
italy
she
whom
i
begged
to
take
me
to
that
beautiful
place
again
ah
it
comes
to
me
now
in
no
dream
but
a
reality
i
have
always
thought
since
i
first
beheld
you
that
i
had
somewhere
at
some
unknown
time
seen
a
picture
which
was
like
you
but
strange
it
was
none
other
than
the
mother
of
my
own
dear
and
your
eyes
have
looked
upon
my
mother
clarence
said
she
gazing
into
his
very
soul
and
she
has
smiled
upon
you
oh
i
shall
love
you
with
a
holier
love
for
this
and
the
young
girl
paused
and
trembled
as
he
held
her
to
his
heart
for
the
thought
came
rushing
into
her
soul
oh
what
a
fearful
thing
is
this
this
depth
of
fervent
love
the
morrow
came
came
to
all
of
our
friends
who
were
gathered
around
the
hearthstone
of
the
widow
grosvenor
with
joy
for
genial
rays
other
than
of
a
may
morning
sun
were
in
their
hearts
yet
those
indescribable
tones
which
under
any
circumstances
hang
around
the
word
farewell
were
gradually
unawares
jarring
jarring
those
gentler
notes
of
peace
even
before
spoken
farewell
the
mother
strained
her
child
to
her
heart
again
and
again
put
her
from
her
to
embrace
her
more
closely
farewell
came
welling
up
from
that
proud
brother
heart
with
the
same
breath
thanking
god
for
giving
him
a
sister
broken
sobs
measured
the
bitterness
of
the
parting
of
those
ones
who
by
an
angel
of
mercy
had
been
lifted
up
to
taste
one
drop
of
that
bliss
upon
earth
which
the
white
man
holds
within
his
power
to
give
or
withhold
farewell
was
it
not
that
one
word
which
marked
the
parting
of
those
two
whose
hearts
had
been
united
above
adieu
to
my
island
home

the
and
the
wild

anonymous
time
wore
heavily
on
with
winnie
santon
after
natalie
had
left
them
left
as
she
was
much
in
her
unnatural
mother
society
who
seemed
to
be
never
more
pleased
than
when
she
might
thwart
her
designs
or
in
some
manner
act
so
as
to
make
those
about
her
uncomfortable
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
she
did
sigh
for
other
days
and
a
confidant
to
whom
she
might
unburden
her
heart
her
father
spent
but
a
small
portion
of
his
time
at
home
on
the
contrary
he
rather
sought
to
avoid
the
fireside
which
had
once
been
so
dear
to
him
his
feelings
whatever
they
might
have
been
were
kept
locked
up
within
his
own
breast
yet
winnie
could
read
the
look
of
sympathy
which
he
bent
upon
her
as
he
grasped
her
by
the
hand
ere
he
hurried
away
to
banish
painful
recollections
by
duties
on
change
when
difficulties
which
natalie
had
foreseen
caused
winnie
heart
to
ache
she
would
school
herself
to
meet
the
injustice
as
she
knew
would
have
done
and
the
timely
advice
of
the
proved
to
the
lone
girl
a
valuable
legacy
she
had
heard
from
natalie
through
the
correspondence
which
for
some
time
she
had
kept
up
with
our
friend
harry
grosvenor
the
which
letters
were
anticipated
and
perused
with
no
common
interest
indeed
her
happiness
scarcely
realized
by
herself
was
closely
allied
therewith
santon
looked
upon
these
ever
punctual
letters
which
appeared
so
frequently
among
the
morning
deposits
with
an
evil
eye
yet
they
did
not
serve
to
banish
the
schemes
of
her
invention
in
regard
to
montague
as
a
favored
competitor
for
the
hand
of
the
heiress
and
it
was
his
unwelcome
visits
which
were
not
unfrequent
that
counted
among
the
numerous
trials
which
weighed
more
and
more
heavily
upon
her
spirits
poor
winnie
each
life
is
made
of
joys
and
sorrows
the
death
of
delwood
was
a
deep
affliction
to
his
son
for
although
he
was
an
austere
man
forbidding
in
his
manners
he
had
always
manifested
a
spirit
of
tenderness
for
his
only
remaining
relative
and
clarence
now
sought
to
dispel
the
loneliness
which
was
creeping
over
him
by
directing
his
attention
to
his
father
unsettled
estates
which
was
no
light
task
as
delwood
had
been
a
gentleman
of
great
property
the
specimens
of
artistical
skill
executed
by
alboni
known
only
to
boston
lovers
of
the
fine
arts
as
the
unknown

were
disposed
of
by
clarence
delwood
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
alboni
who
in
entrusting
the
madonna
to
his
keeping
until
his
return
placed
not
only
the
likeness
of
the
mother
before
him
but
it
possessed
him
of
a
correct
likeness
of
his
betrothed

noble

after
a
most
favorable
passage
of
twelve
days
carried
our
friends
safely
to
the
desired
port
of
liverpool
as
natalie
stood
once
again
upon
terra
firma
she
could
hardly
credit
that
over
three
thousand
miles
of
ocean
separated
her
from
her
home
that
the
same
waves
which
washed
the
shores
of
her
cherished
island
broke
upon
the
shores
of
this
eastern
world
alboni
was
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
as
they
made
the
tour
of
england
and
scotland
for
from
thence
they
would
repair
to
his
own
loved
italy
over
the
mind
of
the
tourist
visiting
the
old
world
for
the
first
time

where
have
transpired

events
recorded
in
history
what
an
immensity
of
thought
and
feeling
sweeps
it
was
thus
with
natalie
she
could
not
realize
that
she
was
treading
in
the
footsteps
of
royalty
who
living
in
long
past
days
had
held
sway
over
this
land
had
looked
upon
this
land
of

england
as
their

london
like
a
mighty

before
them
her
gigantic
towers
telling

westminster
must
be
visited
by

as
natalie
roamed
over
this
vast
structure
in
itself
a
world
of
curiosity
like
so
many
small
churches
roofed
in
by
one
great
canopy
she
lingered
in

famous

gone
to
render
an
account

one
great

of

natalie
rested
upon
the
tomb
of
the
gentle
mary
queen
of
scots
the
history
of
whose
brief
life
and
the
many
cruel
indignities
which
were
heaped
upon
her
rushing
to
her
memory
she
stood
as
if
riveted
to
the
spot
when
a
voice
near
her
attracted
her
attention
and
a
old
sailor
tarpaulin
in
hand
threw
himself
at
her
feet
exclaiming
bless
the
memory
of
old
england
she
is
more
sensible
than
i
ever
thought
for
they
could
have
done
a
nobler
thing
than
to
have
placed
likeness
here
and
thus
the
jolly
fellow
tongue
flew
as
if
he
would
all
the
forecastle
yarns
of
his
lifetime
much
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
guide
who
bade
the
intruder
begone
but
our
nautical
friend
deigning
to
give
this
polite
invitation
to
depart
no
further
notice
than
he
would
have
given
to
the
juvenile
whales
as
they
were
taking
first
lessons
in
spouting
of
their
maternal
protector
the
guide
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
was
about
to
show
honest
jack
what
virtue
there
was
in
force
of
arms
when
alboni
interfered
saying
let
us
at
least
hear
what
the
honest
fellow
would
say
for
himself
your
honor
exclaimed
jack
whose
very
countenance
spoke
as
plainly
as
a
nose
which
appeared
as
if
it
had
been
imitating
the
feathered
tribes
in
their
efforts
to
satisfy
thirst
for
so
long
that
its
tendency
had
become
upward
in
sympathy
and
eyes
which
it
were
difficult
to
follow
in
the
direction
of
both
at
the
same
time
could
speak
that
he
who
had
been
accustomed
to
guiding
his
bark
by
stars
of
the
first
magnitude
all
his
days
would
not
now
at
this
age
of
life
be
guided
by
this
star
of
diminutive
light
your
honor
said
the
astonished
tar
as
he
discovered
the
beautiful
form
before
him
to
be
actually
possessed
of
life
and
breath
and
was
no
senseless
piece
of
statuary
shiver
my
topsails
but
if
i
did
take
the
lady
to
be
representation
my
name
not
john
sampson
sampson
exclaimed
natalie
actually
taking
him
by
the
hand
are
you
john
sampson
i
sampson
the
world
over
my
lady
replied
the
tar
and
why
should
i
be
i
come
all
the
way
from
yankee
america
to
visit
my
native
which
never
produced
beside
its
daily
growth
of
what
might
be
known
the
other
side
of
the
water
as
nature
own
and
but
one
sampson
but
added
he
in
a
subdued
voice
may
i
ask
who
can
take
enough
interest
in
a
poor
fellow
who
never
belonged
to
nothing
as
to
speak
his
name
if
i
had
not
seen
go
down
with
my
own
eyes
i
should
say
that
the
noblest
lady
that
ever
lived
was
standing
before
me
but
she
gone
where
only
her
kind
do
go
and
the
rough
man
drew
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
across
his
eyes
i
am
the
sister
of
a
little
whom
you
once
rescued
from
imminent
peril
perhaps
death
and
i
rejoice
that
fortune
has
favored
me
with
a
sight
of
your
honest
face
that
i
may
repay
in
part
at
least
the
debt
of
gratitude
which
we
owe
to
you
harry
grosvenor
do
you
remember
him
asked
she
placing
her
purse
in
his
hand
ah
that
noble
little
specimen
of
young
america
a
young
hero
could
have
jumped
over
two
johnny
bulls
although
my
happened
to
be
this
side
of
the
water
well
do
i
remember
him
and
you
are
the
sister
that
he
used
to
talk
about
till
i
really
thought
the
fellow
had
got
into
a
lunatic
overall
yes
i
am
his
sister
said
the
and
she
might
have
added
your
name
has
never
been
forgotten
in
my
prayers
but
this
was
no
place
for
the
illiterate
though
sailor
ludicrous
expressions
and
having
doubly
feed
the
guide
who
did
not
witness
a
scene
like
this
often
within
these
walls
which
were
looked
upon
as
sacred
by
other
than
his
eagle
eye
our
friends
sought
the
adelphi
whither
at
alboni
request
sampson
joined
them
for
there
was
something
in
the
words
which
he
had
uttered
that
struck
upon
that
gentleman
ear
and
yet
what
it
was
was
not
clear
to
his
mind
you
have
spoken
of
some
noble
lady
remarked
alboni
pray
tell
me
if
you
have
never
met
with
but
one
whom
you
could
distinguish
by
that
title
in
all
your
travels
and
for
a
very
sensible
reason
there
never
was
but
one
like
her
or
that
is
i
have
always
thought
so
until
replied
the
tar
glancing
toward
natalie
for
my
old
eyes
have
seen
pretty
much
everything
they
have
got
in
this
little
world
ha
i
should
like
to
see
the
inch
of
land
or
water
that
my
foot
has
measured
let
us
hear
a
little
of
your
history
my
good
fellow
begin
with
the
beautiful
lady
said
alboni
proudly
contemplating
his
it
a
yarn
your
honor
that
has
been
spun
to
every
jack
tar
sailed
the
seas
for
i
a
sort
of
feeling
about
me
that
her
memory
should
be
used
to
gratify
common
curiosity
and
sir
it
only
through
the
lady
sweet
face
so
much
like
that
i
am
induced
to
tell
the
story
word
for
word
ye
see
it
was
about
twenty
years
ago
come
september
and
i
shipped
for
a
voyage
to
america
in
the
de
de
well
never
mind
the
name
those
frenchmen
always
spile
their
crafts
with
a
of
a
name
well
we
had
a
fair
time
of
it
till
we
got
pretty
well
on
to
the
american
shores
and
as
for
me
i
never
expect
to
enjoy
myself
again
as
i
did
the
first
part
of
that
voyage
we
had
quite
a
crowd
of
passengers
and
among
them
was
a
gentleman
with
his
lady
and
child
if
that
was
the
handsomest
couple
that
i
ever
sot
eyes
on
then
i
missed
my
reckonings
the
lady
why
your
honor
it
fairly
dazzled
my
eyes
to
look
at
her
she
always
had
a
kind
word
for
everybody
even
us
old
tars
she
would
talk
with
as
if
she
was
the
best
lady
in
the
world
there
was
one
of
us
but
would
have
gone
to
the
feet
first
to
do
her
a
favor
and
as
for
gold
she
wasted
a
young
fortune
on
our
ugly
selves
we
were
within
a
couple
o
days
sail
of
new
york
when
one
of
those
moist
fogs
came
up
such
as
will
make
a
fellow
lose
a
whisk
of
his
patience
if
he
happens
to
have
any
well
we
kept
on
as
we
thought
in
the
same
course
for
about
twelve
hours
when
like
a
clap
of
thunder
we
struck
fast
upon
a
rock
it
was
as
calm
as
any
day
i
ever
saw
but
our
sails
were
all
set
and
that
with
the
run
of
the
sea
gave
us
no
small
shock
but
our
captain
hoped
we
might
not
have
received
any
serious
damages
and
set
the
carpenters
to
work
to
find
what
our
situation
was
well
your
honor
it
was
ten
minutes
after
we
struck
afore
we
began
to
settle
down
i
knew
i
sailed
the
ocean
longer
than
our
captain
and
when
i
found
that
we
were
going
down
i
ran
below
and
found
the
gentleman
and
his
lady
and
told
them
just
how
matters
stood
with
us
and
offered
to
stand
by
them
till
the
last
for
we
had
but
two
boats
aboard
and
i
knew
there
be
a
scene
when
the
lady
heard
this
she
turned
to
her
husband
and
said
am
prepared
to
share
whatever
is
to
be
your
fate
paul
but
god
in
mercy
save
our
child
we
went
aloft
to
the
hurricane
deck
and
such
a
sight
i
have
never
seen
since
every
man
woman
and
child
that
we
met
there
was
looking
for
something
if
no
more
than
a
straw
to
save
themselves
we
had
now
settled
down
even
with
the
water
when
i
a
large
trough
floating
near
made
for
it
and
the
gentleman
taking
the
babe
from
its
mother
arms
spread
a
few
clothes
in
it
and
lashed
the
little
thing
into
this
curious
looking
craft
both
gave
it
one
last
kiss
and
it
was
launched
on
the
wide
ocean
at
this
instant
the
lady
drew
from
her
pocket
a
roll
of
parchment
and
handing
it
to
me
said
you
may
be
saved
if
you
ever
hear
from
my
child
again
put
this
into
safe
hands
for
her
but
if
you
should
never
hear
of
her
keep
it
for
yourself
and
may
god
be
with
us
all
at
that
moment
we
were
carried
down
and
as
i
rose
again
i
caught
at
a
spar
which
was
floating
near
and
looking
after
my
friends
i
saw
them
rise
far
to
leeward
they
were
still
clasped
in
each
other
arms
i
would
willingly
have
gone
down
if
she
might
have
been
saved
but
that
could
not
be
and
i
was
borne
far
out
to
sea
the
fog
lifted
but
i
was
not
able
to
make
my
whereabouts
and
in
this
condition
i
was
left
for
two
days
when
i
was
picked
up
by
a
vessel
bound
to
liverpool
direct
i
told
the
captain
my
story
and
found
that
we
had
missed
our
bearings
that
our
vessel
had
been
wrecked
upon
the
nantucket
shoals
our
voyage
proved
to
be
a
long
and
stormy
one
for
the
september
gales
took
us
on
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
when
a
year
after
i
shipped
for
new
york
i
heard
nothing
of
the
child
and
have
always
supposed
her
little
bark
took
her
to
a
better
land
and
so
it
did
exclaimed
the
weeping
natalie
holding
the
great
rough
hand
of
the
tar
within
her
own
the
little
bark
bore
her
in
safety
to
a
peaceful
shore
where
she
was
received
with
open
arms
by
those
who
have
filled
the
place
of
her
natural
parents
you
see
before
you
my
honest
friend
no
other
than
the
child
of
that
gentle
mother
whose
parting
from
her
babe
you
witnessed
sampson
gazed
upon
her
with
astonishment
and
clapping
both
hands
to
his
head
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
his
exterior
was
yet
in
a
healthful
condition
whatever
transmogrification
the
interior
might
have
undergone
he
exclaimed
i
not
so
sure
after
all
that
my
sampson
i
really
begin
to
think
that
i
must
have
gone
down
with
the
rest
and
yet
i
could
swear
to
it
that
i
a
portion
of
that
if
my
topsails
are
shivered
this
time
clean
gone
by
the
board
and
as
if
to
verify
his
words
he
sank
deeper
into
his
chair
and
broke
into
such
a
train
of
musing
as
caused
the
little
son
of
africa
in
attendance
to
jingle
his
glasses
right
merrily
that
the
wild
bursts
of
his
uncontrollable
mirth
might
sound
the
less
alboni
could
scarce
credit
what
he
had
heard
and
the
parchment
inquired
he
what
was
the
purport
of
that
the
tar
sat
as
one
in
a
trance
but
by
certain
gesticulations
it
appeared
that
his
skysails
were
not
so
shattered
that
he
did
not
comprehend
the
drift
of
the
question
and
after
much
tugging
and
pulling
at
an
old
waistcoat
which
was
worn
beneath
the
he
produced
a
roll
which
from
twenty
years
wear
it
having
been
his
constant
companion
during
that
time
by
sea
and
by
land
had
become
in
appearance
of
an
uncertain
nature
and
handing
it
to
the
gentleman
he
said
after
examining
the
miniature
which
natalie
put
into
his
hand
of
her
mother
the
document
belongs
to
her
and
if
i
a
happened
to
have
met
her
on
the
sea
i
might
have
known
it
even
if
i
had
seen
the
picture
of
the
noble
lady
for
she
the
exact
imitation
but
i
never
can
get
the
land
fog
out
of
my
eyes
when
i
ashore
that
a
sorry
looking
bit
of
paper
your
honor
but
it
what
buy
more
than
one
twist
of
alboni
perused
the
document
he
was
astounded
not
so
much
at
the
contents
of
that
soiled
bit
of
parchment
which
was
the
instrument
by
which
natalie
or
the
holder
could
come
into
possession
of
a
handsome
fortune
but
it
was
at
the
honesty
of
this
sailor
was
it
possible
that
this
poor
fellow
who
gained
his
bread
by
dint
of
hard
labor
having
a
fortune
within
his
grasp
which
he
conscientiously
could
have
called
his
own
had
not
disturbed
a
farthing
thereof
choosing
rather
to
reap
the
fruits
of
his
own
industry
treasuring
this
rich
legacy
as
sacred
to
the
memory
of
a
friend
is
there
indeed
such
honor
to
be
found
in
the
breast
of
fallen
man
aye
is
the
heart
of
the
noble
sailor
that
beats
with
a
heroism
like
this
to
him
who
goeth
down
to
the
great
waters
in
ships
such
honor
is
due
and
you
have
had
this
in
your
possession
for
more
than
twenty
years
said
alboni
and
yet
have
never
helped
yourself
to
a
cent
of
that
which
was
rightly
your
own
pray
tell
me
how
would
you
have
disposed
of
this
wealth
at
last
had
you
never
heard
of
an
heiress
to
the
estate
d
ye
see
sir
i
have
travelled
this
world
over
so
many
times
without
making
a
beacon
light
occasionally
now
there
a
difference
in
yer
honor
there
the
revolving
light
and
many
other
kinds
of
light
but
the
brightest
of
all
is
that
steady
light
which
shines
into
the
darkness
of
the
poor
sailor
soul
i
first
made
that
light
sir
at
the
seamen
home
in
new
york
and
it
was
there
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
lend
this
money
to
the
lord
for
i
was
convinced
that
that
would
be
the
most
profitable
investment
and
i
been
thinking
of
it
more
and
more
for
these
last
few
days
if
i
better
settle
this
on
the
home
for
you
know
these
iron
frames
will
give
out
after
a
while
men
do
live
to
see
nine
hundred
years
nowadays
though
i
named
after
the
strongest
fellow
that
ever
handled
a
harpoon
alboni
read
the
document
to
his
the
effect
of
which
was
that
certain
sums
of
specie
deposited
in
the
bank
of
by
the
honorable
paul
sunderland
could
by
the
bearer
of
this
instrument
be
withdrawn
at
sight
sampson
tongue
was
still
flying
with
rapidity
as
if
his
auditors
had
not
been
void
of
a
number
while
alboni
and
natalie
were
holding
a
consultation
aside
you
are
right
my
child
you
will
never
miss
this
from
the
wealth
which
i
thank
god
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
place
in
your
hands
let
it
be
as
you
say
divide
this
sum
between
your
protectors
i
thank
you
my
dear
generous
father
said
natalie
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
the
cheek
of
her
relative
you
have
made
me
happy
i
will
send
this
most
acceptable
gift
to
my
dear
mother
not
paining
her
feelings
with
the
thought
that
i
would
seek
to
repay
her
love
for
her
child
with
gold
but
as
an
expression
of
her
daughter
filial
affection
and
not
only
will
i
reward
this
honest
man
with
the
half
of
this
sum
but
he
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
with
his
own
hand
this
offering
to
my
mother
to
this
latter
proposition
sampson
acquiesced
with
pleasure
he
was
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
once
more
seeing
his
young
shipmate
whose
mysterious
allusions
to
the
he
could
now
comprehend
but
as
to
himself
receiving
so
liberal
a
legacy
he
was
not
prepared
to
look
upon
the
proposition
as
favorably
take
it
my
good
fellow
said
alboni
it
is
rightly
your
own
and
should
you
ever
have
anything
to
spare
you
can
not
do
better
than
to
make
the
investment
which
you
had
purposed
they
parted
the
honest
tar
to
take
his
way
to
columbia
happy
land
while
alboni
and
the
would
prolong
their
visit
for
a
little
here
then
depart
to
feast
their
eyes
upon
italian
skies
sampson
looked
long
after
the
gentle
form
of
the
as
he
left
them
for
when
might
he
see
so
fair
a
sight
again
and
this
was
the
home
of
my
mother
mused
natalie
as
arrived
in
florence
our
tourists
entered
the
arched
gateway
which
led
to
the
broad
domains
of
the
long
absent
master
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
to
rest
his
soft
lingering
rays
kissing
the
fleecy
clouds
which
a
blush
came
and
went
now
deepening
as
the
rose
carmine
giving
place
to
the
most
delicate
tinge
that
sat
upon
a
maiden
cheek
born
of
pure
modesty
the
scent
of
the
delicate
jasmine
perfumed
the
air
while
the
pensive
strains
of
some
fair
one
soft
and
clear
as
the
tones
of
a
was
borne
on
the
stillness
of
evening
to
the
ear
of
the
lovely
who
reclining
upon
the
bosom
of
her
father
her
sunny
tresses
mingling
with
the
silvery
locks
which
told
that
he
had
seen
many
winters
whispered
in
words
low
and
musical
my
angel
mother
i
can
feel
her
presence
near
she
has
breathed
this
blissful
air
can
it
be
more
heavenly
there
with
her
eyes
still
upturned
as
if
their
mildness
might
pierce
the
veil
of
azure
her
lips
moved
as
they
had
ofttimes
done
before
in
praise
and
thanksgiving
for
the
wondrous
beauty
which
our
father
in
his
boundless
love
hath
set
before
his
children
as
alboni
gazed
upon
each
familiar
object
surrounding
his
beautiful
villa
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
everything
in
the
same
state
of
preservation
as
when
he
had
last
beheld
his
home
once
so
dear
instead
of
an
air
of
desolation
everything
falling
to
decay
as
would
be
a
natural
consequence
attendant
upon
the
long
absence
of
the
family
the
scrupulous
care
and
attention
of
some
interested
one
was
apparent
on
all
sides
even
the
little
ivied
bower
which
sunderland
had
arranged
with
his
own
hands
when
he
first
smiled
upon
his
beautiful
bride
was
still
in
existence
and
here
did
natalie
dream
away
many
a
happy
hour
during
her
stay
in
dear
florence
the
old
man
and
his
frugal
wife
to
whose
keeping
the
premises
had
been
entrusted
and
who
occupied
a
small
tenement
upon
the
grounds
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
if
one
had
appeared
to
them
from
the
dead
than
were
they
when
alboni
stood
in
the
door
of
their
cottage
i
told
you
his
honor
would
come
again
said
the
woman
turning
to
her
husband
but
i
was
really
afeared
it
might
be
in
our
time
and
as
we
no
one
to
leave
in
our
shoes
i
of
the
that
the
place
would
dropped
off
to
some
stranger
ha
yes
replied
the
husband
my
old
woman
never
far
out
o
the
way
though
she
does
sometimes
talk
as
if
she
expected
to
become
extinguished
but
for
all
that
she
equal
to
two
common
ones
but
particularly
glad
you
come
home
on
a
good
many
for
if
the
place
must
go
into
any
other
hands
than
an
alboni
i
not
over
anxious
to
witness
the
change
in
the
coat
of
arms
alboni
received
this
compliment
as
it
was
intended
and
as
one
motive
in
visiting
his
native
land
again
was
to
dispose
of
this
estate
he
now
directed
his
attention
to
the
future
comfort
of
this
most
worthy
couple
for
the
domestics
who
had
served
in
the
family
of
alboni
must
not
suffer
from
want
accordingly
a
comfortable
cottage
adjoining
these
lands
was
obtained
for
their
use
and
an
annual
income
sufficient
to
supply
their
wants
settled
upon
them
for
life
and
so
with
the
estate
of
the
albonis
whose
last
representative
of
the
name
would
soon
depart
for
a
memorial
of
days
past
this
aged
couple
hoped
to
spend
in
contentment
the
residue
of
their
days
amid
all
the
splendor
and
gayety
of
fashionable
life
in
italy
the
was
never
so
happy
as
when
seated
in
the
ivy
bower
which
looked
out
upon
a
little
lake
the
same
which
had
been
her
favorite
place
of
retreat
where
she
might
watch
the
face
of
the
mellow
skies
or
roaming
through
those
ancient
halls
she
might
feast
her
eyes
on
the
many
antique
surroundings
but
most
of
all
she
loved
to
linger
in
the
great
reception
hall
whose
walls
were
hung
with
the
portraits
of
her
mother
family
for
many
past
generations
some
of
those
countenances
denoted
men
of
much
strength
of
character
amounting
almost
to
a
fierceness
but
in
nearly
every
female
face
natalie
discerned
that
same
gentleness
of
spirit
which
unknown
to
herself
was
the
expression
of
her
own
spiritual
countenance
beneath
the
portrait
of
the
last
alboni
was
a
place
reserved
for
that
of
her
child
the
lady
sunderland
but
by
some
circumstance
it
had
never
been
placed
there
during
the
period
of
our
heroine
stay
in
italy
she
spent
much
of
her
time
in
the
home
of
her
ancestors
to
which
she
became
greatly
attached
but
once
having
been
introduced
to
an
admiring
italian
assembly
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
remain
in
seclusion
this
new
star
so
mild
yet
brilliant
was
the
theme
of
present
conversation
she
never
appeared
in
public
but
the
blessings
of
high
and
low
marked
her
way
and
as
she
knelt
in
public
worship
meekly
bowing
at
the
name
of
christ
there
was
not
one
who
looked
upon
her
but
this
passage
of
scripture
was
brought
to
their
minds
if
the
righteous
scarcely
are
saved
where
shall
the
ungodly
and
the
sinner
appear
but
all
times
come
to
an
end
passing
away
is
written
upon
everything
pertaining
to
earth
and
the
time
when
our
friends
should
return
to
their
island
home
drew
near
it
was
the
day
before
they
would
bid
adieu
to
pleasant
scenes
here
to
journey
to
liverpool
for
business
led
alboni
to
sail
for
america
from
that
port
the
sun
had
gone
down
the
last
sunset
which
the
would
look
upon
here
the
last
sunset
pause
dear
reader
when
will
that
same
sun
set
to
us
for
the
last
time
it
may
be
soon
it
may
be
later
yet
it
is
the
same
for
all
time
is
present
with
god
the
evening
shades
began
to
claim
their
reign
regardless
of
the
smiles
and
entreaties
of
lingering
day
that
he
would
delay
his
approach
fit
symbol
of
sunny
youth
who
would
banish
from
his
presence
death
unrelenting
grasp
and
yet
who
does
not
love
night
with
earnest
tenderness
and
has
no
one
a
smile
for
death
natalie
still
lingered
beneath
the
ivy
trellis
her
feet
drawn
upon
the
cushions
for
she
would
not
crush
the
gentle
flowers
which
told
to
her
their
love
in
the
rich
perfume
of
the
air
and
yet
if
trodden
under
foot
the
flowers
with
their
dying
breath
the
beauteous
flowers
do
with
their
richest
perfume
breathe
forgiveness
her
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
lake
its
glassy
ripples
a
striking
contrast
to
the
giant
waves
upon
which
she
had
ever
looked
with
delight
ah
who
may
divine
her
thoughts
as
she
muses
thus
a
faint
smile
plays
with
the
dimples
around
her
mouth
and
but
for
the
words
she
whispers
one
might
indeed
think
her
intent
upon
the
ripples
which
kiss
the
shore
at
her
feet
but
no
she
is
transported
to
where
the
breaker
roar
is
heard
and
a
proud
noble
form
she
sees
his
piercing
eye
bent
upon
the
sea
full
well
she
knows
for
whom
his
heart
thus
wildly
beats
dear
good
clarence
she
whispers
and
starting
from
her
revery
she
kneels
in
prayer
my
father
god
thou
art
merciful
unto
the
weakest
of
thy
frail
ones
keep
thou
my
heart
to
thee
alone
may
i
have
no
other
gods
before
thee
cast
out
all
idols
if
any
there
be
and
breathe
thy
spirit
within
my
soul
and
may
thy
will
be
done
amen
was
the
response
of
bright
ones
of
upper
spheres
and
may
we
receive
strength
to
say
thy
will
be
done
adieu
dear
home
of
my
childhood
spake
alboni
as
the
dim
outlines
of
the
land
of
his
nativity
at
last
faded
in
the
distance
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
he
gave
himself
up
to
his
own
reflections
from
which
natalie
would
not
recall
him
arrived
in
liverpool
the
steamer
in
which
they
were
to
have
embarked
had
sailed
consequently
a
few
more
days
were
added
to
their
sojourn
there
but
when
at
length
their
proud
steamer
left
her
pier
accompanied
by
many
heartfelt
good
wishes
that
she
might
be
attended
with
all
success
that
her
voyage
might
prove
most
favorable
the
wept
tears
of
delight
that
she
might
once
more
listen
to
those
voices
of
the
deep
and
calmly
gazing
upon
the
countenance
of
alboni
she
said
father
we
are
going
home
her
words
fell
upon
the
ear
of
an
officer
of
the
ship
a
gentleman
of
that
nobleness
of
soul
which
alone
constitutes
a
true
man
one
whose
kind
and
gentlemanly
consideration
of
the
comfort
and
pleasure
of
those
who
have
from
time
to
time
crossed
that
three
thousand
miles
of
ocean
which
separates
liverpool
from
new
york
have
before
been
publicly
mentioned
and
will
long
be
remembered
by
those
who
have
before
come
under
his
guidance
we
are
going
home
the
officer
raised
his
hat
as
he
passed
the
involuntarily
repeating
her
words
words
which
many
times
have
been
idly
spoken
but
how
full
of
meaning
as
that
gallant
steamship
made
her
way
over
the
rolling
billows
like
a
thing
of
life
as
if
indeed
she
recognized
the
course
which
she
had
so
many
times
borne
aloft
her
proud
head
in
seasons
of
tempest
as
well
as
of
sunshine
there
was
not
one
who
walked
her
decks
but
looked
upon
her
gigantic
form
as
an
ark
of
safety
rather
than
the
frail
plank
which
only
separated
not
far
from
three
hundred
immortal
beings
from
an
ocean
grave
several
days
sail
left
merrie
england
far
behind
and
as
they
drew
nearer
the
american
shores
many
an
eye
was
deluded
with
the
belief
that
it
had
been
the
successful
one
in
being
the
first
to
make
the
outline
of
the
nearest
shore
of
this
land
of
the
free
there
was
the
eye
of
youth
lit
up
with
the
light
of
innocence
which
when
riper
years
should
have
left
their
impress
might
have
given
place
to
more
of
guile
while
hand
in
hand
along
her
peaceful
decks
roamed
old
age
and
infancy
alike
joyous
in
the
air
of
cheerfulness
which
reigned
with
all
around
it
was
near
the
hour
of
weather
favorable
with
the
exception
of
a
fog
which
had
suddenly
sprung
up
occasionally
the
signal
bell
sounded
that
if
any
vessel
were
in
their
neighborhood
she
might
know
of
their
whereabouts
the
fog
as
suddenly
lifted
as
it
had
shut
in
upon
them
but
to
close
down
again
heavier
than
before
natalie
had
not
as
most
of
the
ladies
gone
below
but
stood
intent
upon
those
new
thoughts
which
the
veil
of
fog
which
had
shut
out
all
sight
and
sound
save
an
occasional
tone
of
the
bell
had
inspired
when
a
crash
which
shook
their
vessel
from
stem
to
stern
caused
every
one
to
look
upon
the
countenance
of
his
fellow
there
to
read
the
words
which
he
had
no
power
to
utter
a
propeller
was
at
that
instant
seen
moving
athwart
their
bows
and
from
the
severity
of
the
shock
it
was
thought
that
the
smaller
vessel
must
have
sustained
serious
damage
accordingly
a
boat
was
lowered
from
the
steamer
under
command
of
the
first
officer
to
render
the
unfortunates
such
assistance
as
was
in
their
power
believing
their
own
damages
to
be
but
slight
but
the
boat
had
not
been
long
gone
when
word
was
passed
to
their
captain
that
they
were
in
a
sinking
condition
upon
examination
it
was
found
that
a
large
breakage
had
been
made
directly
under
their
bows
and
the
sea
was
rushing
in
terrifically
all
was
now
a
scene
of
confusion
some
applied
themselves
diligently
to
the
pumps
and
others
sought
to
diminish
the
leak
by
stretching
a
sail
across
the
gap
while
the
passengers
hurried
some
one
way
and
some
another
as
if
in
a
state
of
frenzy
to
seek
assistance
from
the
propeller
even
if
she
might
not
be
in
as
disastrous
a
condition
as
themselves
was
out
of
the
question
for
both
vessels
being
under
full
headway
at
the
moment
of
the
collision
she
was
now
again
enveloped
in
fog
oh
god
must
it
be
thus
no
escape
for
these
three
hundred
beings
what
an
awful
moment
of
suspense
still
the
steamer
settles
down
what
is
done
must
be
done
speedily
the
captain
is
without
his
first
officer
with
whom
he
might
consult
his
absence
necessarily
detracting
from
the
number
of
boats
but
had
the
boats
been
suffered
to
remain
unmolested
for
the
benefit
of
the
passengers
it
were
doubtful
if
they
could
have
contained
so
large
a
number
where
now
are
those
gladsome
little
children
those
aged
men
and
women
who
listening
to
those
voices
of
childhood
would
fain
have
believed
themselves
young
again
ah
where
are
they
wringing
their
hands
in
wild
despair
clambering
over
the
sides
of
the
ship
endeavoring
to
save
themselves
on
rafts
spars
or
articles
affording
inferior
protection
the
where
is
she
where
is
her
aged
protector
upon
the
deck
of
that
steamer
the
kneels
with
eyes
meekly
turned
heavenward
she
asks
that
peace
may
be
shed
upon
the
hearts
of
that
agonized
throng
that
they
may
fitly
receive
this
will
of
divine
dispensation
never
was
her
countenance
more
serene
just
then
a
voice
was
heard
at
her
side
we
are
going
home
it
was
the
voice
of
the
noble
officer
who
had
before
noted
her
words
i
was
happy
replied
natalie
when
i
said
we
are
going
home
but
i
did
not
realize
we
would
so
soon
meet
the
loved
ones
in
that
celestial
home
where
we
shall
part
no
more
forever
and
i
am
happy
now
yet
this
terrible
cry
of
anguish
incites
my
deep
deep
sympathies
thank
god
for
this
presence
of
an
angel
to
shed
light
over
my
last
hour
said
the
officer
i
now
go
down
through
that
dark
valley
of
death
unattended
by
that
gloom
which
had
seized
upon
my
soul
my
god
in
mercy
wilt
thou
sustain
my
wife
and
children
when
they
shall
look
for
my
coming
and
i
shall
never
return
to
them
more
and
may
they
soon
meet
me
there
he
knew
not
that
the
youngling
of
his
flock
would
so
soon
join
him
in
singing
the
songs
of
the
redeemed
he
said
no
more
they
were
going
down
a
was
in
his
hands
which
he
would
have
secured
about
the
but
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
saying
take
it
to
yourself
farewell
supported
by
her
arm
she
gazed
upon
the
waters
they
were
not
angry
peacefully
sighing
they
met
her
touch
as
if
they
would
welcome
her
home
mother
she
breathed
with
her
last
of
mortal
breath
was
it
a
farewell
to
that
loved
one
of
earth
or
did
she
joyfully
greet
her
sainted
mother
who
awaited
the
coming
of
her
child
to
her
home
in
the
skies
where
the
lamb
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
shall
feed
them
and
shall
lead
them
unto
living
fountains
of
waters
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
the
blue
waves
rolled
on
in
their
untiring
way
and
the
sun
went
calmly
down
upon
this
day
the
of
september
eighteen
hundred
and
a
day
long
to
be
remembered
both
in
the
eastern
and
western
world
for
in
it
was
the
sundering
of
many
mortal
ties
many
a
family
circle
wept
as
they
looked
upon
the
familiar
places
which
would
know
their
lost
ones
no
more
but
ah
chide
me
not
kind
reader
in
thus
leading
you
adown
to
the
coldness
of
death
in
setting
before
you
that
which
causes
your
tender
heart
to
shudder
mourn
not
for
these
departed
for
would
we
not
wish
to
meet
them
there
when
ere
long
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
grieve
not
because
that
gentle
one
has
passed
away
say
not
that
she
met
with
an
untimely
end
when
in
her
summer
of
life
all
was
pleasantness
before
her
think
of
her
not
as
one
gone
far
away
never
to
be
on
earth
more
cast
her
not
from
your
heart
where
during
her
little
day
here
in
innocence
she
entwined
herself
within
its
recesses
oh
no
for
she
is
nearer
to
us
now
she
is
not
dead
but
has
passed
from
death
to
life
and
may
her
memory
remain
with
us
in
freshness
as
the
ivy
green
which
loves
best
the
place
of
holy
quietude
and
by
her
influence
may
we
in
spirit
come
to
be
more
chapter
xii
alone
shall
i
not
listen
to
the
moaning
that
strangely
vibrates
like
the
swelling
sea
and
fancy
it
an
echoed
storm
intoning
a
solemn
dirge
in
memory
of
thee
miss
mary
chase
a
lone
man
walks
the
shores
of
nantucket
his
noble
form
is
slightly
bent
and
with
the
raven
of
his
hair
is
blended
the
faintest
tinge
of
gray
though
he
is
evidently
a
man
to
whom
the
meridian
of
life
is
yet
far
in
the
distance
his
fine
countenance
is
sad
yet
as
he
gazes
far
out
the
sea
deep
in
his
piercing
eye
is
a
subdued
look
of
resignation
shedding
light
over
his
features
which
a
stranger
might
attribute
to
a
mind
of
happiness
and
yet
that
look
of
sadness
is
oftenest
triumphant
leading
those
who
meet
him
for
the
first
time
to
ask
from
whence
he
came
for
his
countenance
betrays
that
his
has
been
not
the
common
lot
of
man
ah
who
is
he
on
whom
young
men
and
maidens
look
with
pitying
eye
to
whom
the
old
man
lifts
his
hat
and
little
children
cease
from
their
sports
as
he
passes
and
quietly
slip
the
innocent
daisy
or
the
arbutus
into
his
hand
which
they
have
culled
from
the
wide
commons
where
they
have
been
told
the
good
loved
to
stray
it
is
clarence
delwood
his
has
been
a
bitter
bitter
draught
yet
its
dregs
have
in
a
measure
lost
their
power
for
he
has
learned
that
is
his
father
holds
the
cup
little
did
he
think
as
they
sat
together
there
on
that
high
bank
which
overlooks
the
sea
upon
that
last
evening
spent
with
his
cherished
one
in
her
island
home
that
it
was
to
be
the
last
forever
that
her
voice
would
no
more
be
heard
in
glad
response
to
nature
shouts
of
joyousness
yet
as
alone
he
sits
beneath
the
silent
night
there
where
she
last
told
to
him
her
love
he
fancies
that
the
stars
in
pity
smile
upon
him
and
as
one
more
gentle
than
the
rest
leaves
its
place
in
the
heavens
and
slowly
descends
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
finally
resting
upon
the
bosom
of
ocean
he
listens
for
the
music
of
her
harp
strikes
upon
his
soul
and
in
the
crested
billows
which
play
at
his
feet
a
shining
form
he
sees
her
robe
all
sparkling
with
the
pearly
drops
of
the
sea
he
would
fain
go
to
her
as
she
smiles
upon
him
as
was
ever
her
wont
but
a
voice
he
hears
saying
not
yet
and
the
bright
one
recedes
from
his
view
reader
you
may
visit
nantucket
isle
you
may
walk
those
peaceful
shores
where
she
loved
to
roam
you
may
meet
there
that
lone
man
on
the
shore
you
will
approach
him
with
feelings
of
deep
regard
not
unlike
reverence
but
do
not
hesitate
to
inquire
of
him
for
the
grave
of
the
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ocean
blue
pointing
with
his
finger
heavenward
he
will
direct
you
to
a
grassy
mound
at
whose
head
is
a
weeping
willow
upon
the
broad
trunk
of
which
is
wrought
in
letters
of
pearl
the
awaits
for
thee
with
a
tear
you
turn
away
with
the
resolve
in
your
heart
that
you
will
henceforth
so
live
as
that
when
this
mortal
life
is
ended
you
may
attain
everlasting
joy
and
felicity
through
jesus
christ
our
lord
you
will
seek
the
fireside
of
the
widow
grosvenor
where
from
a
lips
you
will
be
assured
of
the
blessings
which
accompany
a
dutiful
child
that
fireside
is
not
desolate
for
the
members
of
the
household
have
been
led
to
say
thy
will
o
lord
not
mine
be
done
grosvenor
though
somewhat
advanced
in
life
still
retains
that
peculiar
freshness
of
her
earlier
days
and
as
she
proudly
glances
upon
the
young
man
by
her
side
calling
him
my
son
you
can
hardly
recognize
in
his
athletic
form
the
little
of
other
days
yet
it
is
none
other
although
he
has
arrived
to
the
dignity
of
captain
and
as
sampson
prophesied
a
smarter
man
never
sailed
the
ocean
but
who
is
this
witching
beauty
at
his
side
who
would
fain
impress
you
with
a
belief
that
that
mischief
which
will
not
remain
concealed
for
the
briefest
period
is
not
her
entire
composition
do
you
not
mistrust
who
other
than
miss
winnie
santon
she
who
having
tired
of
the
gallants
of
the
wild
west
or
rather
of
their
numbers
came
to
the
wise
conclusion
that
a
city
life
was
designed
for
such
as
she
she
the
coquettish
heiress
who
once
stood
very
much
in
doubt
as
to
the
state
of
civilization
among
these
poor
fishermen
yes
it
is
our
winnie
and
she
is
now
the
wife
of
capt
harry
grosvenor
and
is
she
happy
in
this
her
choice
ask
her
if
she
would
exchange
her
brave
husband
for
one
of
those
superfine
niceties
who
suing
for
favor
at
her
feet
had
at
the
same
time
lined
their
vows
of
love
and
constancy
with
the
yellow
dust
which
had
they
known
the
strong
chest
to
have
been
at
their
backs
while
in
this
humble
posture
it
were
uncertain
to
which
might
have
been
made
an
apology
the
fair
lady
or
her
dowry
but
what
is
the
cause
of
that
little
commotion
among
sundry
flowered
blankets
juvenile
counterpanes
which
you
have
but
this
moment
discovered
in
a
neighboring
niche
is
it
old
nep
who
has
ensconced
himself
in
this
dainty
little
nest
no
for
you
left
him
sleeping
under
the
shade
of
the
weeping
willow
surely
those
seven
kits
with
fourteen
blue
eyes
have
not
lived
to
this
green
old
age
ah
the
mystery
is
solved
by
the
presence
of
a
tiny
hand
which
elevates
itself
above
the
little
heap
of
whiteness
and
a
smiling
baby
face
has
contrived
to
work
its
way
into
the
no
less
smiling
sunlight
the
which
baby
must
not
partake
of
too
freely
consequently
the
owner
of
said
property
appears
to
alleviate
the
difficulty
which
is
done
by
giving
miss
baby
a
toss
into
and
with
a
ringing
laugh
not
unlike
those
wild
bursts
of
merriment
which
were
wont
to
be
heard
reverberating
through
the
halls
of
santon
mansion
yes
it
is
winnie
child
and
she
tells
you
while
a
more
thoughtful
look
sits
upon
her
countenance
that
the
name
of
the
little
one
is
natalie
although
she
adds
as
earnestly
as
i
love
my
child
i
know
there
can
never
be
another
like
and
pointing
to
a
portrait
draped
in
white
she
presses
her
child
more
closely
to
her
heart
you
look
long
and
earnestly
upon
that
countenance
of
the
madonna
the
one
face
representing
mother
and
child
the
portrait
is
the
property
of
clarence
delwood
he
who
is
now
known
as
lone
man
of
the
shore
and
while
you
are
yet
gazing
upon
it
he
enters
and
pressing
his
lips
to
the
canvas
he
takes
a
bible
from
the
case
and
reads
you
accidentally
observe
the
upon
which
is
written
to
the
from
her
mother
on
her
second
birthday
and
as
he
reads
a
smile
lights
up
his
countenance
for
it
is
there
written
thou
shalt
labor
unto
the
lord
and
a
more
cheerful
expression
is
his
for
it
is
through
his
ready
pen
that
the
alms
chest
of
the
poor
receives
its
liberal
supplies
ere
you
depart
you
inquire
as
to
the
fate
of
sampson
learning
that
through
his
agency
the
widow
grosvenor
has
come
in
possession
of
a
handsome
fortune
the
daughter
gift
to
her
mother
so
that
now
she
is
enabled
to
make
comfortable
many
a
cheerless
fireside
where
poverty
through
the
loss
of
a
husband
and
father
as
he
went
down
to
do
business
on
the
great
deep
had
reigned
honest
sampson
after
so
many
years
spent
upon
the
ocean
has
concluded
to
live
the
remainder
of
his
days
on
shore
and
in
the
darkest
night
when
the
hurricane
roars
and
the
waves
break
high
the
brilliant
light
entrusted
to
his
care
may
be
seen
for
many
miles
around
by
the
voyager
who
may
be
sailing
in
the
neighborhood
of
old
nantucket
capt
harry
grosvenor
has
also
bade
adieu
to
his
home
on
the
sea
for
together
with
winnie
entreaties
and
the
goodly
amount
of
wealth
which
she
declares
as
rightly
belonging
to
her
husband
as
to
herself
he
has
been
induced
to
give
his
little
wife
the
promise
that
he
will
sail
the
seas
no
more
but
there
is
one
who
is
no
unimportant
member
of
this
happy
family
for
whom
you
have
forgotten
to
inquire
so
intent
are
you
as
you
pass
out
from
them
into
the
silent
night
upon
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
but
you
are
minded
of
this
negligence
by
a
voice
near
and
a
negro
tottering
from
beneath
the
weight
of
years
whom
you
recognize
at
once
as
old
vingo
stands
before
you
his
mind
is
much
impaired
for
he
has
attained
his
second
childhood
yet
from
his
disconnected
remarks
it
is
evident
that
he
still
retains
a
pleasant
remembrance
of
the
past
old
bingo
neber
want
noting
more
he
replies
to
your
question
of
what

can
do

in

thou
hast
so
used
the
one
talent
lent
unto
thee
that
at
the
last
when
every
shall
have
fled
away
and
the
mountains
shall
not

place
at

right

glorious
throne

god

blessed
words

morning
star

shalt
again
find
that
pure
gem
who
in
her
little
day
on
earth
led
thee
to
the
bright
river
of
life
where
thou
hast
sought
and
found
that
of
great
price

blue
waves

not
yet
tired
of
their
unceasing
sports
they
still
chase
each
other
in
mad
glee
from
far
over
the
sea
each
striving
to
outdo
his
fellows
as
they
come
tumbling
in
with
voices
the
beaming
beacon
still
keeps
vigil
over
nantucket
peaceful
slumberers
while
her
little
ones
in
their
gladsome
dreams
of
childhood
wander
up
and
down
those
shores
intent
upon
their
search
for
the
most
delicate
exclaiming
with
each
new
found
treasure

gentle

adieu
with
many
thanks
for

kind
attention
and
great
is
my
joy
if
haply
any
have
been
impressed
in
spirit
with
that
meek
and
holy
submission
which
shall
lead
them
to
say
thy
will
o
lord
not
mine
be
done
and
when
loved
ones
shall
be
borne
away
from
us
may
we
take
up
our
cross
with
renewed
love
for
him
who
gave
and
hath
taken
away
and
say
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
forever
