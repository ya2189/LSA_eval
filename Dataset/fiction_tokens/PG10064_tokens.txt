beltane
the
smith
chapter
i
how
beltane
lived
within
the
greenwood
in
a
glade
of
the
forest
yet
not
so
far
but
that
one
might
hear
the
chime
of
bells
stealing
across
the
valley
from
the
great
minster
of
mortain
on
a
still
evening
dwelt
beltane
the
smith
alone
he
lived
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
trees
happy
when
the
piping
of
the
birds
was
in
his
ears
and
joying
to
listen
to
the
plash
and
murmur
of
the
brook
that
ran
merrily
beside
his
hut
or
pausing
the
strokes
of
his
ponderous
hammer
to
catch
its
never
failing
music
a
mighty
man
was
beltane
the
smith
despite
his
youth
already
great
of
stature
and
comely
of
feature
much
knew
he
of
woodcraft
of
the
growth
of
herb
and
tree
and
flower
of
beast
and
bird
and
how
to
tell
each
by
its
cry
or
song
or
flight
he
knew
the
ways
of
fish
in
the
streams
and
could
tell
the
course
of
the
stars
in
the
heavens
versed
was
he
likewise
in
the
ancient
wisdoms
and
philosophies
both
latin
and
greek
having
learned
all
these
things
from
him
whom
men
called
ambrose
the
hermit
but
of
men
and
cities
he
knew
little
and
of
women
and
the
ways
of
women
less
than
nothing
for
of
these
matters
ambrose
spake
not
thus
being
grown
from
youth
to
manhood
for
that
a
man
must
needs
live
beltane
builded
him
a
hut
beside
the
brook
and
set
up
an
anvil
thereby
whereon
he
beat
out
and
and
such
implements
as
the
and
they
that
lived
within
the
green
had
need
of
of
an
evening
he
would
seek
out
the
hermit
ambrose
and
they
would
talk
together
of
many
things
but
seldom
of
men
and
cities
and
never
of
women
and
the
ways
of
women
once
therefore
wondering
beltane
had
said
my
father
amongst
all
these
matters
you
speak
never
of
women
and
the
ways
of
women
though
history
is
full
of
their
doings
and
all
poets
sing
praise
of
their
wondrous
beauty
as
this
helena
of
troy
whom
men
called
of
the
world
but
ambrose
sighed
and
shook
his
head
saying
art
thou
indeed
a
man
so
soon
my
beltane
and
so
sat
watching
him
awhile
anon
he
rose
and
striding
to
and
fro
spake
sudden
and
passionate
on
this
wise
beltane
i
tell
thee
the
beauty
of
women
is
an
evil
thing
a
lure
to
wreck
the
souls
of
men
by
woman
came
sin
into
the
world
by
her
beauty
she
blinds
the
eyes
of
men
to
truth
and
honour
leading
them
into
all
manner
of
wantonness
whereby
their
very
manhood
is
destroyed
this
helen
of
troy
of
whom
ye
speak
was
nought
but
a
vile
adulteress
with
a
heart
false
and
foul
by
whose
sin
many
died
and
troy
town
was
utterly
destroyed
alas
sighed
beltane
that
one
so
fair
should
be
a
thing
so
evil
thereafter
he
went
his
way
very
sad
and
thoughtful
and
that
night
lying
upon
his
bed
he
heard
the
voices
of
the
trees
sighing
and
murmuring
one
to
another
like
souls
that
sorrowed
for
sin
sake
and
broken
dreams
and
ideals
alas
that
one
so
fair
should
be
a
thing
so
evil
but
above
the
whispers
of
the
trees
loud
and
insistent
rose
the
merry
chatter
of
the
brook
speaking
to
him
of
many
things
of
life
and
the
lust
of
life
the
pomp
and
stir
of
cities
the
sound
of
song
and
laughter
of
women
and
the
beauty
of
women
and
of
the
sweet
mad
wonder
of
love
of
all
these
things
the
brook
sang
in
the
darkness
and
beltane
sighed
and
sighing
fell
asleep
thus
lived
my
beltane
in
the
woodland
ranging
the
forest
with
eye
quick
to
see
the
beauty
of
earth
and
sky
and
ear
open
to
the
thousand
voices
around
him
or
busied
at
his
anvil
hearkening
to
the
wondrous
tales
of
travel
and
strange
adventure
told
by
wandering
knight
and
the
while
with
skilful
hand
he
mended
broken
mail
or
dented
casque
and
thereafter
upon
the
mossy
sward
would
make
trial
of
their
strength
and
valour
whereby
he
both
took
and
gave
right
lusty
knocks
or
again
when
work
failed
he
would
lie
upon
the
grass
chin
on
fist
poring
over
some
ancient
legend
or
sit
with
brush
and
colours
illuminating
on
vellum
wherein
right
cunning
was
he
now
it
chanced
that
as
he
sat
thus
brush
in
hand
upon
a
certain
fair
afternoon
he
suddenly
espied
one
who
stood
watching
him
from
the
shade
of
a
tree
near
by
a
very
tall
man
he
was
long
and
lean
and
grim
of
aspect
with
a
mouth
by
reason
of
an
ancient
and
yet
withal
he
had
a
jovial
eye
but
now
seeing
himself
observed
he
shook
his
grizzled
head
and
sighed
whereat
said
beltane
busied
with
his
brush
again
good
sir
pray
what
amiss
the
world
youth
the
world
is
all
amiss
yet
mark
me
here
sit
you
colour
with
a
little
brush
answered
beltane
an
so
ye
seek
to
do
your
duty
as
regardfully
as
i
now
daub
this
colour
messire
in
so
much
shall
the
world
be
bettered
my
duty
youth
quoth
the
stranger
rasping
a
hand
across
his
grizzled
chin
my
duty
ha
is
well
said
so
needs
must
i
now
fight
with
thee
fight
with
me
says
beltane
his
keen
gaze
upon
the
speaker
aye
verily
nodded
the
stranger
and
forthwith
laying
by
his
long
cloak
he
showed
two
swords
whose
broad
blades
glittered
red
and
evil
in
the
sunset
but
says
beltane
shaking
his
head
i
have
no
quarrel
with
thee
good
fellow
quarrel
exclaimed
the
stranger
no
quarrel
quotha
what
matter
for
that
surely
you
would
not
forego
a
good
bout
for
so
small
a
matter
doth
a
man
eat
only
when
famishing
or
drink
but
to
quench
his
thirst
out
upon
thee
messire
smith
but
sir
said
beltane
bending
to
his
brush
again
an
i
should
fight
with
thee
where
would
be
the
reason
nowhere
youth
since
fighting
is
ever
at
odds
with
reason
yet
for
such
unreasonable
reasons
do
reasoning
men
fight
none
the
less
i
will
not
fight
thee
answered
beltane
deftly
touching
in
the
wing
of
an
archangel
so
let
there
be
an
end
o
end
forsooth
we
have
not
yet
begun
an
you
must
have
a
quarrel
right
fully
will
i
provoke
thee
since
fight
with
thee
i
must
it
being
so
my
duty
how
thy
duty
i
am
so
commanded
by
whom
by
one
who
being
dead
yet
liveth
nay
ask
no
names
yet
mark
me
this
the
world
amiss
boy
pentavalon
groans
beneath
a
black
usurper
heel
all
the
sins
of
hell
are
loose
murder
and
riot
lust
and
rapine
march
you
eastward
but
a
day
through
the
forest
yonder
and
you
shall
see
the
trees
bear
strange
fruit
in
our
country
the
amiss
messire
yet
here
sit
you
wasting
your
days
a
foolish
brush
stuck
in
thy
fist
so
am
i
come
nor
will
i
go
hence
until
i
have
tried
thy
mettle
quoth
beltane
shaking
his
head
intent
upon
his
work
you
speak
me
riddles
sir
yet
can
i
speak
thee
to
the
point
and
so
it
be
thy
wish
as
thus
now
mark
me
boy
thou
art
a
fool
a
dog
a
fatuous
ass
a
slave
a
nincompoop
a
cowardly
boy
and
as
such
mark
me
again
now
do
i
spit
at
thee
hereupon
beltane
having
finished
the
archangel
wing
laid
by
his
brush
and
with
thoughtful
mien
arose
and
being
upon
his
feet
turned
him
swift
and
sudden
and
caught
the
stranger
in
a
fierce
and
cunning
wrestling
grip
and
forthwith
threw
him
upon
his
back
whereat
this
strange
man
sitting
upon
the
sward
smiled
his
wry
and
twisted
smile
and
looked
upon
beltane
with
bright
approving
eye
a
pretty
spirit
he
nodded
is
a
sweet
and
gentle
youth
all
good
beef
and
bone
a
little
green
as
yet
perchance
but
is
no
matter
a
mighty
arm
a
noble
thigh
and
shoulders
body
o
me
but
is
in
the
breed
young
sir
by
these
same
signs
and
portents
my
soul
is
uplifted
and
hope
singeth
a
new
song
within
me
so
saying
the
stranger
sprang
nimbly
to
his
feet
and
catching
up
one
of
the
swords
took
it
by
the
blade
and
gave
its
massy
hilt
to
beltane
hand
said
he
look
well
upon
this
blade
young
sir
in
duchy
kingdom
or
county
you
shall
not
find
its
match
nor
the
like
of
the
terrible
hand
that
bore
it
time
was
when
this
good
steel
mark
how
it
glitters
yet
struck
deep
for
liberty
and
justice
and
all
fair
things
before
whose
might
oppression
quailed
and
hung
its
head
and
in
whose
shadow
peace
and
mercy
rested
was
long
ago
but
this
good
steel
is
bright
and
undimmed
as
ever
ha
mark
it
boy
those
eyes
o
thine
shall
behold
its
equal
so
beltane
took
hold
upon
the
great
sword
felt
the
spring
and
balance
of
the
blade
and
viewed
it
up
from
glittering
point
to
plain
and
simple
and
thus
graven
deep
within
the
broad
steel
he
read
this
word
resurgam
ha
cried
the
stranger
see
you
the
legend
good
youth
speak
me
now
what
it
doth
signify
and
beltane
answered
shall
arise
good
boy
aye
verily
mark
me
that
is
a
fair
thought
look
you
and
the
motto
of
a
great
and
noble
house
and
by
the
rood
i
think
likewise
a
prophecy
thus
speaking
the
stranger
stooped
and
taking
up
the
other
sword
faced
beltane
therewith
saying
in
soft
and
wheedling
tones
come
now
let
us
fight
together
thou
and
i
and
deny
me
not
lest
mark
me
this
well
youth
lest
i
spit
at
thee
again
then
he
raised
his
sword
and
smote
beltane
with
the
flat
of
it
and
the
blow
stung
wherefore
beltane
instinctively
swung
his
weapon
and
thrilled
with
sudden
unknown
joy
at
the
clash
of
steel
on
steel
and
so
they
engaged
and
there
within
the
leafy
solitude
beltane
and
the
stranger
fought
together
the
long
blades
whirled
and
flashed
and
rang
upon
the
stillness
and
ever
as
they
fought
the
stranger
smiled
his
wry
smile
mocking
and
gibing
at
him
whereat
beltane
mouth
grew
the
grimmer
and
his
blows
the
heavier
yet
wherever
he
struck
there
already
was
the
stranger
blade
to
meet
him
whereat
the
stranger
laughed
fierce
and
loud
taunting
him
on
this
wise
how
now
thou
dauber
of
colours
betake
thee
to
thy
little
brush
belike
it
shall
serve
thee
better
aye
me
betake
thee
to
thy
little
brush
better
fitted
to
thee
than
a
noble
sword
thou
daubing
boy
now
did
my
beltane
wax
wroth
indeed
and
smote
amain
until
his
breath
grew
short
and
thick
but
ever
steel
rang
on
steel
and
ever
the
stranger
laughed
and
gibed
until
beltane
strokes
grew
slower
then
with
a
sudden
fierce
shout
did
the
stranger
beset
my
beltane
with
strokes
so
swift
and
strong
now
to
right
of
him
now
to
left
that
the
very
air
seemed
full
of
flaming
whirling
steel
and
in
that
moment
as
beltane
gave
back
the
stranger
smote
thrice
in
as
many
moments
with
the
flat
of
his
blade
once
upon
the
crown
once
upon
the
shoulder
and
once
upon
the
thigh
fierce
eyed
and
scant
of
breath
beltane
redoubled
his
blows
striving
to
beat
his
mocker
to
the
earth
whereat
he
but
laughed
again
saying
look
to
thy
long
legs
dullard
and
forthwith
smote
beltane
upon
the
leg
now
thine
arm
slothful
boy
thy
left
arm
and
he
smote
beltane
upon
the
arm
now
thy
sconce
boy
thy
mazzard
thy
sleepy
golden
head
and
straightway
he
smote
him
on
the
head
and
thereafter
with
sudden
cunning
stroke
beat
the
great
sword
from
beltane
grip
and
so
laughing
yet
paused
and
stood
leaning
upon
his
own
long
weapon
but
beltane
stood
with
bent
head
hurt
in
his
pride
angry
and
beyond
all
thought
amazed
yet
being
humbled
most
of
all
he
kept
his
gaze
bent
earthwards
and
spake
no
word
now
hereupon
the
stranger
grew
solemn
likewise
and
looked
at
beltane
with
kindly
approving
eyes
nay
indeed
quoth
he
be
not
abashed
good
youth
take
it
not
amiss
that
i
have
worsted
thee
is
true
had
i
been
so
minded
i
might
have
cut
thee
into
gobbets
no
larger
than
thy
little
brush
but
then
body
o
me
i
have
lived
by
stroke
of
sword
from
my
youth
up
and
have
fought
in
divers
wars
and
countries
so
take
it
not
to
heart
good
youth
with
the
word
he
nodded
and
stooping
took
up
the
sword
and
thereafter
cast
his
cloak
about
him
whereat
beltane
lifted
his
head
and
spake
art
going
sir
wilt
not
try
me
once
again
methinks
i
might
do
a
little
better
this
time
an
so
god
wills
aye
so
thou
shalt
sweet
youth
cried
the
stranger
clapping
him
upon
the
shoulder
yet
not
now
for
i
must
begone
yet
shall
i
return
then
i
pray
you
leave
with
me
the
sword
till
you
be
come
again
the
sword
ha
doth
thy
soul
cleave
unto
it
so
soon
my
good
sweet
boy
leave
the
sword
quotha
aye
truly
some
day
but
for
the
nonce
no
no
thy
hand
is
not
fitted
to
bear
it
yet
nor
worthy
such
a
blade
but
some
day
belike
who
knows
fare
thee
well
sweet
youth
i
come
again
and
so
the
tall
grim
stranger
turned
him
about
smiling
his
wry
smile
and
strode
away
through
the
green
then
beltane
went
back
minded
to
finish
his
painting
but
the
colours
had
lost
their
charm
for
him
moreover
the
light
was
failing
wherefore
he
put
brushes
and
colours
aside
and
stripping
plunged
into
the
cool
sweet
waters
of
a
certain
quiet
pool
and
so
much
heartened
and
refreshed
thereby
went
betimes
to
bed
but
now
he
thought
no
more
of
women
and
the
ways
of
women
but
rather
of
this
stranger
man
of
his
wry
smile
and
of
his
wondrous
and
bethinking
him
of
the
great
sword
he
yearned
after
it
as
only
youth
may
yearn
and
so
sighing
fell
asleep
and
in
his
dreams
all
night
was
the
rushing
thunder
of
many
fierce
feet
and
the
roaring
din
of
bitter
fight
and
conflict
up
to
an
elbow
sprang
beltane
to
find
the
sun
new
risen
filling
his
humble
chamber
with
its
golden
glory
and
in
this
radiance
upon
the
open
threshold
the
tall
grim
figure
of
the
stranger
messire
quoth
beltane
rubbing
sleepy
eyes
you
wake
betimes
meseemeth
aye
sluggard
boy
there
is
work
to
do
betwixt
us
how
so
sir
my
time
in
the
greenwood
groweth
short
within
the
week
i
must
away
for
there
are
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
upon
the
borders
quoth
beltane
wondering
war
and
conflict
have
been
within
my
dreams
all
night
dreams
boy
i
tell
thee
the
time
groweth
ripe
for
action
and
mark
me
this
wherein
perchance
thou
too
shalt
share
yet
much
have
i
to
teach
thee
first
so
rise
rise
now
when
beltane
was
risen
and
clad
he
folded
his
arms
across
his
broad
chest
and
stared
upon
the
stranger
with
grave
eyes
who
art
thou
he
questioned
and
what
would
you
here
again
as
to
thy
first
question
sir
smith
is
no
matter
for
that
but
as
for
thy
second
am
i
come
to
teach
thee
the
use
and
manage
of
horse
and
lance
it
being
so
my
duty
and
wherefore
thy
duty
for
that
i
am
so
commanded
by
whom
by
one
who
yet
liveth
being
dead
now
beltane
frowned
at
this
and
shook
his
head
saying
more
riddles
messire
yet
now
will
i
speak
thee
plain
as
thus
i
am
a
smith
and
have
no
lust
to
strife
or
knightly
deeds
nor
will
i
attempt
them
for
strife
begetteth
bitter
strife
and
war
is
an
evil
thing
that
trust
to
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword
is
so
written
and
is
meseemeth
a
faithful
saying
this
sorry
world
hath
known
over
much
of
war
and
hate
of
strife
and
bloodshed
so
shall
these
my
hands
go
innocent
of
more
then
indeed
did
the
stranger
stare
with
jaws
agape
for
wonder
at
my
beltane
saying
and
so
staring
turned
him
to
the
door
and
back
again
and
fain
would
speak
yet
could
not
for
a
while
then
besotted
boy
he
cried
o
craven
youth
o
babe
o
suckling
was
it
for
this
thou
wert
begot
hast
thou
no
bowels
no
blood
no
manhood
forsooth
and
must
i
spit
on
thee
indeed
and
so
it
be
thy
will
messire
said
beltane
but
as
they
stood
thus
beltane
with
arms
yet
crossed
his
lips
at
the
other
fierce
amaze
the
stranger
and
frowning
came
a
shadow
athwart
the
level
glory
of
the
sun
and
turning
beltane
beheld
the
hermit
ambrose
tall
and
spare
beneath
his
tattered
gown
bareheaded
and
bare
of
foot
whose
eyes
were
bright
and
quick
despite
the
snow
of
hair
and
beard
and
in
whose
gentle
face
and
humble
mien
was
yet
a
high
and
noble
look
at
odds
with
his
lowly
guise
and
tattered
vesture
at
sight
of
whom
the
stranger
of
a
sudden
bowed
his
grizzled
head
and
sank
upon
his
knee
lord
he
said
and
kissed
the
hermit
long
coarse
robe
whereon
the
hermit
bent
and
touched
him
with
a
gentle
hand
my
son
said
he
go
you
and
leave
us
together
a
while
forthwith
the
stranger
rose
from
his
knee
and
went
out
into
the
glory
of
the
morning
then
the
hermit
came
to
beltane
and
set
his
two
hands
upon
his
mighty
shoulders
and
spake
to
him
very
gently
on
this
wise
thou
knowest
my
beltane
how
all
thy
days
i
have
taught
thee
to
love
all
fair
and
sweet
and
noble
things
for
they
are
of
god
a
fair
thought
now
to
live
out
thy
life
here
within
these
calm
leafy
solitudes
but
better
death
by
the
sword
for
some
high
unselfish
purpose
than
to
live
out
a
life
of
ease
safe
and
cloistered
all
thy
days
to
live
for
thine
own
ends
is
human
to
die
for
some
great
cause
for
liberty
or
for
another
good
that
my
son
were
and
there
was
a
man
of
sorrows
whose
word
was
this
that
he
came
to
bring
peace
on
this
earth
but
a
sword
for
good
can
not
outface
evil
but
strife
must
needs
follow
behold
now
here
another
sword
my
beltane
keep
it
henceforth
so
long
as
thou
keep
honour
so
saying
ambrose
the
hermit
took
from
beneath
his
habit
that
for
which
beltane
had
yearned
that
same
great
blade
whereon
whose
steel
was
graven
the
legend
resurgam
so
ambrose
put
the
sword
in
beltane
hand
saying
be
terrible
my
son
that
evil
may
flee
before
thee
learn
to
be
strong
that
thou
be
merciful
then
the
hermit
stretched
forth
his
hands
and
blessed
my
beltane
and
turned
about
and
so
was
gone
but
beltane
stood
awhile
to
swing
the
great
blade
lightly
to
and
fro
and
to
stare
upon
it
with
shining
eyes
then
having
hid
it
within
his
bed
he
went
forth
into
the
glade
and
here
he
presently
beheld
a
great
grey
horse
tethered
to
a
tree
hard
by
a
mettled
steed
that
tossed
its
noble
head
and
snuffed
the
fragrant
air
of
morning
pawing
at
the
earth
with
impatient
hoof
now
as
he
stood
gazing
came
the
stranger
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
messire
said
he
try
an
thou
canst
back
the
steed
yonder
beltane
smiled
for
he
had
loved
horses
all
his
days
and
loosing
the
horse
led
it
out
into
the
open
and
would
have
mounted
but
the
spirited
beast
knowing
him
not
reared
and
plunged
and
strove
to
break
the
grip
upon
the
bridle
but
the
grip
was
strong
and
compelling
then
beltane
soothed
him
with
gentle
voice
and
hand
and
of
a
sudden
vaulted
lightly
into
the
saddle
and
being
there
felt
the
great
beast
rear
under
him
and
laughing
joyously
struck
him
with
open
palm
and
set
off
at
a
thunderous
gallop
away
away
they
sped
up
the
sunny
glade
past
oak
and
beech
and
elm
through
light
and
shadow
until
before
them
showed
a
tree
of
vast
girth
and
mighty
spread
of
branches
now
would
beltane
have
reined
aside
but
the
great
horse
ears
flat
and
eyes
rolling
held
blindly
on
then
beltane
frowned
and
leaning
forward
seized
the
bridle
close
beside
the
bit
and
gripping
it
so
put
forth
his
strength
slowly
slowly
the
great
fierce
head
was
drawn
low
and
lower
the
jaws
gaped
wide
but
beltane
grip
grew
ever
the
fiercer
until
snorting
panting
the
great
grey
horse
faltered
in
his
stride
checked
his
pace
slipped
stumbled
and
so
stood
quivering
in
the
shade
of
the
tree
thereafter
beltane
turned
him
and
galloping
back
drew
rein
where
the
stranger
sat
watching
him
with
his
wry
smile
aye
he
nodded
we
shall
make
of
thee
a
horseman
yet
but
as
to
lance
now
and
armour
quoth
beltane
smiling
good
sir
i
am
a
smith
and
in
my
time
have
mended
many
a
suit
of
mail
aye
and
made
them
too
though
was
but
to
try
my
hand
as
for
a
lance
i
have
oft
tilted
at
the
ring
astride
a
forest
pony
and
betimes
have
run
a
course
with
wandering
say
you
so
boy
said
the
stranger
and
rising
took
from
behind
a
tree
a
long
and
heavy
lance
and
thrust
it
into
beltane
grip
then
drawing
his
sword
he
set
it
upright
in
the
sward
and
upon
the
hilt
he
put
his
cap
saying
ride
back
up
the
glade
and
try
an
thou
canst
pick
up
my
cap
on
thy
point
at
a
gallop
so
beltane
rode
up
the
glade
and
wheeling
at
a
distance
came
galloping
down
with
levelled
lance
and
thundered
by
with
the
cap
fluttering
from
his
lance
point
art
less
of
a
dullard
than
i
thought
thee
said
the
stranger
taking
back
his
cap
though
mark
me
boy
is
another
matter
to
ride
against
a
man
fully
armed
and
equipped
lance
to
lance
and
shield
to
shield
than
to
charge
a
harmless
ancient
leathern
cap
still
art
less
of
a
dullard
than
i
thought
thee
but
there
is
the
sword
now
with
the
sword
thou
art
indeed
but
a
sorry
fool
go
fetch
the
sword
and
i
will
belabor
thee
again
so
beltane
lighting
down
from
the
horse
that
reared
and
plunged
no
more
went
and
fetched
the
great
sword
and
when
they
had
laid
their
jerkins
by
for
the
sun
was
hot
they
faced
each
other
foot
to
foot
and
eye
to
eye
then
once
again
the
long
blades
whirled
and
flew
and
rang
together
and
once
again
the
stranger
laughed
and
gibed
and
struck
my
beltane
how
and
where
he
would
nor
gave
him
stay
or
respite
till
beltane
mighty
arm
grew
aweary
and
his
shoulder
ached
and
burned
then
when
he
recked
not
of
it
the
stranger
with
the
same
cunning
stroke
beat
the
sword
from
beltane
hand
and
laughed
aloud
and
wagged
his
head
saying
art
faint
boy
and
scant
o
breath
already
methinks
we
shall
make
of
thee
a
lusty
sworder
but
beholding
beltane
flushing
cheek
and
drooping
eye
reached
out
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
go
to
cried
he
art
young
and
all
unlearned
as
yet
heed
not
my
gibes
and
quirks
is
ever
so
my
custom
when
steel
is
ringing
and
mark
me
i
do
think
it
a
good
custom
as
apt
to
put
a
man
off
his
ward
and
flurry
him
in
his
stroke
never
despair
youth
for
i
tell
thee
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
my
name
is
known
nor
shall
you
find
in
any
duchy
kingdom
or
county
a
sworder
such
as
i
for
mark
me
now
your
knight
and
trusting
to
his
armour
doth
use
his
sword
but
to
thrust
and
smite
but
and
mark
me
again
boy
a
man
can
not
go
ever
in
his
armour
nor
yet
be
sure
when
foes
are
nigh
and
at
all
times
is
well
to
make
thy
weapon
both
sword
and
shield
is
a
goodly
art
indeed
i
think
a
pretty
one
come
now
take
up
thy
sword
and
i
will
teach
thee
all
my
strokes
and
show
thee
how
is
done
thus
then
this
stranger
dwelt
the
week
with
beltane
in
the
greenwood
teaching
him
day
by
day
tricks
of
sword
and
much
martial
lore
beside
and
day
by
day
a
friendship
waxed
and
grew
betwixt
them
so
that
upon
the
seventh
morning
as
they
broke
their
fast
together
beltane
heart
was
heavy
and
his
look
downcast
whereat
the
stranger
spake
him
thus
whence
thy
dole
good
youth
for
that
needs
must
i
part
with
thee
and
thy
friends
are
few
belike
none
messire
answered
beltane
sighing
aye
me
and
yet
is
well
enough
for
mark
me
youth
friends
be
ofttimes
a
mixed
blessing
as
for
me
is
true
i
am
thy
friend
and
so
shall
ever
be
so
long
as
you
shall
bear
yon
goodly
blade
and
wherefore
questioned
beltane
moreover
thou
art
my
scholar
and
like
perchance
to
prove
thyself
some
day
a
notable
sworder
and
a
sweet
and
doughty
fighter
belike
yet
hast
never
spoken
me
thy
name
messire
why
hast
questioned
me
but
once
and
then
thou
wert
something
of
a
blockhead
dreamer
methought
but
now
messire
beltane
since
thou
know
benedict
of
bourne
am
i
called
now
hereupon
beltane
rose
and
stood
upon
his
feet
staring
at
this
stranger
who
with
at
lip
paused
to
smile
his
wry
smile
aha
said
he
hast
heard
such
a
name
ere
now
even
here
in
the
greenwood
sir
answered
beltane
betimes
i
have
talked
with
soldiers
and
so
do
i
know
thee
for
that
same
great
knight
who
of
all
the
nobles
of
pentavalon
doth
yet
withstand
the
great
duke
ivo
call
you
that
black
usurper
youth
body
o
me
i
knew
a
greater
once
methinks
aye
nodded
beltane
there
was
him
men
called
the
strong
ha
quoth
sir
benedict
setting
down
his
what
know
you
of
duke
beltane
nought
but
that
he
was
a
great
and
lusty
fighter
who
yet
loved
peace
and
mercy
but
truth
and
justice
most
of
all
and
sighed
sir
benedict
we
have
black
ivo
aye
me
these
be
sorry
days
for
pentavalon
is
said
he
woos
the
young
duchess
yonder
hast
ever
seen
helen
of
mortain
sir
smith
nay
but
i
heard
tell
that
she
is
wondrous
fair
hum
quoth
sir
benedict
i
love
not
your
methinks
an
ivo
win
her
she
lead
him
how
she
will
or
be
broke
in
the
adventure
a
malison
upon
him
be
it
how
it
may
so
having
presently
made
an
end
of
eating
sir
benedict
arose
and
forthwith
donned
quilted
gambeson
and
thereafter
his
hauberk
of
bright
mail
and
plain
surcoat
and
buckling
his
sword
about
him
strode
into
the
glade
where
stood
the
great
grey
horse
now
being
mounted
sir
benedict
stayed
awhile
to
look
down
at
beltane
whiles
beltane
looked
up
at
him
messire
beltane
said
he
pointing
to
his
scarred
cheek
you
look
upon
my
scar
i
think
quoth
beltane
flushing
hot
nay

well
though

took

sighed
sir
benedict
a
fair
sized
babe
to
bear
within
a
cloak
and
thou
hast
been
baptized
in

ere
now
and

and
so
until

fare
thee
well
messire
beltane
so
saying
sir
benedict
of
bourne
smiled
his
twisted
smile
and
wheeling
his
horse
rode
away
down
the
glade
his
mail
glistening
in
the
early
light
and
his
lance
point
winking
and
twinkling
amid
the
green
chapter
ii
how
beltane
had
word
with
the
duke
black
ivo
now
it
fell
out
upon
a
day
that
as
beltane
strode
the
forest
ways
there
met
him
a
fine
cavalcade
gay
with
the
stir
of
broidered
petticoat
and
ermined
mantle
and
pausing
beneath
a
tree
he
stood
to
hearken
to
the
soft
sweet
voices
of
the
ladies
and
to
gaze
enraptured
upon
their
varied
beauty
foremost
of
all
rode
a
man
richly
habited
a
man
of
great
strength
and
breadth
of
shoulder
and
of
a
bearing
high
and
arrogant
his
face
framed
in
long
black
hair
that
curled
to
meet
his
shoulder
was
of
a
dark
and
swarthy
hue
fierce
looking
and
masterful
by
reason
of
prominent
chin
and
nose
and
of
his
relentless
mouth
black
were
his
eyes
and
bold
now
staring
bright
and
wide
now
glittering
heavy
narrowed
lids
yet
when
he
smiled
they
glittered
brightest
and
his
lips
showed
moistly
red
beside
him
rode
a
lady
of
a
wondrous
dark
beauty
sleepy
eyed
and
languid
yet
her
glance
was
quick
to
meet
the
duke
bold
look
and
her
mantle
her
fingers
met
once
in
a
while
and
clung
with
his
what
time
his
red
lips
would
smile
but
for
the
most
part
his
brow
was
gloomy
and
he
fingered
his
chin
as
one
in
thought
as
he
paced
along
upon
his
richly
caparisoned
steed
pinching
at
his
long
chin
with
supple
fingers
his
heavy
brows
drawn
low
of
a
sudden
his
narrowed
lids
widened
and
his
eyes
gleamed
bright
and
black
as
they
beheld
my
beltane
standing
in
the
shade
of
the
tree
aha
said
he
drawing
rein
what
insolent
rogue
art
thou
to
stand
gaping
at
thy
betters
and
beltane
answered
no
rogue
messire
but
an
honest
man
i
pray
god
whom
folk
call
beltane
the
smith
the
staring
eyes
grew
suddenly
narrow
the
scarlet
mouth
curled
in
a
slow
smile
and
the
tall
man
spake
yet
with
his
gaze
bent
ever
upon
beltane
fair
lords
he
said
and
you
most
sweet
and
gentle
ladies
our
sport
hath
been
but
poor
hitherto
methinks
i
can
show
you
a
better
a
game
we
play
full
oft
in
my
country
would
that
our
gracious
lady
of
mortain
were
here
nor
had
balked
us
of
her
wilful
company
ho
gefroi
he
called
come
you
and
break
me
the
back
of
this
rogue
and
straightway
came
one
from
the
rear
where
rode
the
servants
and
a
great
bronzed
fellow
bearded
to
the
eyes
of
him
loosing
his
as
he
came
who
having
tossed
aside
cap
and
pourpoint
strode
toward
beltane
his
eyes
quick
and
bright
his
teeth
agleam
through
the
hair
of
his
beard
come
thou
forest
rogue
said
he
my
lord
duke
loveth
not
to
wait
for
man
or
maid
so
have
at
thee
great
he
looked
and
tall
as
beltane
self
a
hairy
man
of
mighty
girth
with
muscles
that
swelled
on
arm
and
breast
and
rippled
upon
his
back
thus
as
he
stood
and
laughed
grimly
confident
and
determined
not
a
few
were
they
who
sighed
for
beltane
for
his
youth
sake
and
because
of
his
golden
curls
and
gentle
eyes
for
this
gefroi
was
accounted
a
very
strong
man
and
a
matchless
wrestler
withal
is
a
fair
match
how
think
you
sir
jocelyn
said
the
duke
and
turned
him
to
one
who
rode
at
his
elbow
a
youthful
slender
figure
with
long
curled
hair
and
sleepy
eyes
a
fair
match
sir
jocelyn
in
very
sooth
sweet
my
lord
gramercy
and
by
your
gracious
leave
not
so
sighed
sir
jocelyn
this
gefroi
o
thine
is
a
rare
breaker
of
necks
and
hath
all
the
wrestlers
in
the
three
duchies
a
man
is
he
set
in
his
strength
and
experienced
but
this
forester
tall
though
he
be
is
but
a
beardless
youth
the
duke
smiled
his
slow
smile
his
curving
nostrils
quivered
and
were
still
and
he
glanced
toward
sir
jocelyn
through
veiling
lids
quoth
he
art
rather
for
a
game
of
ball
messire
or
a
song
upon
a
lute
so
saying
he
turned
and
signed
to
gefroi
with
his
finger
as
for
sir
jocelyn
he
only
curled
a
lock
of
his
long
hair
and
hummed
beneath
his
breath
now
beltane
misliking
the
matter
would
fain
have
gone
upon
his
way
but
wheresoever
he
turned
there
gefroi
was
also
barring
his
path
wherefore
beltane
eye
kindled
and
he
raised
his
staff
threateningly
fellow
quoth
he
stand
from
my
way
lest
i
mischief
thee
but
gefroi
only
laughed
and
looked
to
his
lord
who
beckoning
an
archer
bid
him
lay
an
arrow
to
his
string
shoot
me
the
cowardly
rogue
so
soon
as
he
turn
his
back
said
he
whereat
gefroi
laughed
again
wagging
his
head
come
forest
knave
quoth
he
i
know
a
trick
to
snap
thy
neck
so
sweetly
shalt
never
know
i
warrant
thee
come
take
but
a
moment
and
my
lord
begins
to
lack
of
patience
so
beltane
laid
by
his
staff
and
tightening
his
girdle
faced
the
hairy
gefroi
and
there
befell
that
the
which
though
you
shall
find
no
mention
of
it
in
any
chronicle
came
much
to
be
talked
of
thereafter
so
that
a
ballade
was
writ
of
it
the
which
beginneth
thus
wrestled
in
the
green
with
a
mighty
man
a
goodlier
bout
was
never
seen
since
the
world
began
while
beltane
was
tightening
his
girdle
swift
and
sudden
gefroi
closed
pinning
his
arms
in
a
cunning
hold
and
thrice
he
swung
my
beltane
from
his
feet
so
that
many
clapped
their
hands
the
while
the
squires
and
shouted
lustily
only
sir
jocelyn
curled
the
lock
of
hair
upon
his
finger
and
was
silent
to
him
quoth
my
lord
duke
smiling
messire
an
you
be
in
a
mind
to
wager
now
i
will
lay
you
this
my
roan
stallion
that
suit
of
triple
mail
you
won
at
dunismere
joust
that
gefroi
breaks
thy
forester
back
within
two
falls
how
say
you
sweet
my
lord
it
liketh
me
beyond
telling
thy
roan
is
a
peerless
beast
sighed
sir
jocelyn
and
so
fell
once
more
to
humming
his
song
beneath
his
breath
now
beltane
had
wrestled
oft
with
strangers
in
the
greenwood
and
had
learned
many
cunning
and
desperate
holds
moreover
he
had
learned
to
bide
his
time
thus
though
gefroi
iron
muscles
yet
pinned
his
arms
he
waited
but
with
every
nerve
for
that
moment
when
gefroi
vicious
grip
should
slacken
to
and
fro
the
wrestlers
swayed
knee
to
knee
and
breast
to
breast
fierce
and
silent
and
grim
as
hath
been
said
this
gefroi
was
a
very
cunning
fellow
and
once
and
twice
he
put
forth
all
his
strength
seeking
to
use
a
certain
cruel
trick
whereby
many
a
goodly
man
had
died
ere
now
but
once
and
twice
the
hold
was
foiled
yet
feebly
and
as
though
by
chance
and
gefroi
wondered
a
third
time
he
essayed
it
therefore
but
in
that
moment
sudden
and
fierce
and
strong
beltane
twisted
in
his
loosened
grasp
found
at
last
the
deadly
hold
he
sought
and
gefroi
wondered
no
more
for
about
him
was
a
painful
grip
that
grew
ever
tighter
and
more
relentless
now
gefroi
breath
grew
short
and
laboured
the
muscles
stood
out
on
his
writhing
body
in
knotted
cords
but
ever
that
cruel
grip
grew
more
deadly
crushing
his
spirit
and
robbing
him
of
his
wonted
strength
and
those
about
them
watched
that
mighty
struggle
hushed
for
wonder
of
it
even
sir
jocelyn
had
forgot
his
lock
of
hair
and
hummed
no
more
for
desperately
though
he
fought
and
struggled
they
saw
great
body
was
bending
slowly
backward
his
eyes
stared
up
wild
and
bloodshot
into
the
fierce
set
face
above
him
swaying
now
he
saw
the
wide
ring
of
faces
the
quiver
of
leaves
and
the
blue
beyond
all
through
the
mist
of
beltane
yellow
hair
and
then
writhing
in
his
anguish
he
turned
and
buried
his
teeth
in
beltane
naked
arm
and
with
a
cunning
twist
broke
from
that
deadly
grip
and
staggered
free
straightway
the
air
was
full
of
shouts
and
cries
some
praising
some
condemning
while
gefroi
stood
with
hanging
arms
and
panted
but
beltane
looking
upon
his
hurt
laughed
short
and
fierce
and
as
gefroi
came
upon
him
stooped
and
caught
him
below
the
loins
then
beltane
the
strong
the
mighty
put
forth
his
strength
and
whirling
gefroi
aloft
hurled
him
backwards
over
his
shoulder
so
gefroi
the
wrestler
fell
and
lay
with
hairy
arms
as
one
that
is
dead
and
for
a
space
no
man
spake
for
the
wonder
of
it
by
all
the
saints
but
was
a
mighty
throw
sighed
sir
jocelyn
though
alack
sweet
my
lord
almost
seem
my
forester
hath
something
spoiled
thy
wrestler
and
is
the
roan
stallion
thine
frowned
the
duke
and
to
none
would
i
lose
him
with
a
fairer
grace
for
was
a
good
bout
as
i
foretold
yet
by
the
head
of
martin
meseemeth
yon
carrion
might
have
done
me
better
so
saying
my
lord
duke
gave
his
horse
the
spur
and
as
he
passed
the
prostrate
form
of
gefroi
leaned
him
down
and
smote
the
wrestler
thrice
with
the
whip
he
held
and
so
rode
on
bidding
his
followers
let
him
lie
but
sir
jocelyn
paused
to
look
down
at
beltane
who
was
setting
his
dress
in
order
sir
forester
thou
hast
a
mighty
arm
quoth
he
and
thy
face
liketh
me
well
here
for
thee
and
tossing
a
purse
to
beltane
feet
he
rode
upon
his
way
so
the
gay
cavalcade
passed
the
leafy
arches
with
the
jingle
of
bridle
and
stirrup
and
the
sound
of
jest
and
laughter
and
was
presently
lost
amid
the
green
only
gefroi
the
wrestler
lay
there
upon
his
back
and
groaned
then
came
beltane
and
knelt
and
took
his
heavy
head
upon
his
knee
whereat
gefroi
opened
his
eyes
and
groaned
again
good
fellow
said
beltane
i
had
not
meant
to
throw
thee
so
heavily
nay
forester
would
it
had
been
a
little
harder
for
a
ruined
man
am
i
this
day
how
so
have
you
not
life
i
would
death
and
i
bit
you
in
the
arm
i
mind
me
aye
was
in
the
arm
for
that
am
i
heartily
sorry
forester
but
when
a
man
seeth
fame
and
fortune
slipping
from
him
aye
and
his
honour
i
had
nigh
forgot
that
fame
and
fortune
and
honour
so
small
a
thing
as
a
bite
may
be
forgiven
i
forgive
thee
full
and
freely
spoke
like
an
honest
forester
said
gefroi
and
groaned
again
the
favour
of
a
lord
is
a
slippery
thing
much
like
an
eel
quick
to
wriggle
away
an
hour
agone
my
lord
duke
held
me
in
much
esteem
while
now
and
he
struck
me
on
the
face
here
slowly
gefroi
got
him
upon
his
feet
and
having
donned
cap
and
pourpoint
shook
his
head
and
sighed
quoth
he
alack
is
a
ruined
man
am
i
this
day
would
i
had
broken
thy
neck
or
thou
mine
and
so
god
den
to
ye
forester
then
gefroi
the
wrestler
turned
and
plodded
on
his
way
walking
slow
and
with
drooping
head
as
one
who
knoweth
not
whither
he
goes
or
careth
now
as
he
watched
beltane
bethought
him
of
the
purse
and
taking
it
up
ran
after
gefroi
and
thrust
it
into
his
hand
help
thee
to
find
a
new
service
mayhap
so
saying
my
beltane
turned
upon
his
heel
and
strode
away
while
gefroi
stood
staring
long
after
beltane
was
vanished
amid
the
trees
so
thus
it
was
that
beltane
looked
his
first
upon
duke
ivo
of
pentavalon
and
thus
did
he
overthrow
gefroi
the
famous
wrestler
and
because
of
this
many
were
they
knights
and
nobles
and
esquires
who
sought
out
beltane
lonely
hut
beside
the
brook
with
offers
of
service
or
to
try
a
fall
with
him
but
at
their
offers
beltane
laughed
and
shook
his
head
and
all
who
came
to
wrestle
he
threw
upon
their
backs
and
thus
my
beltane
dwelt
within
the
greenwood
waxing
mightier
day
by
day
chapter
iii
how
love
came
to
beltane
in
the
greenwood
upon
a
day
beltane
stood
at
his
forge
fashioning
an
and
having
tempered
it
thereafter
in
the
brook
he
laid
it
by
and
straightening
his
back
strode
forth
into
the
glade
all
ignorant
of
the
eyes
that
watched
him
curiously
through
the
leaves
and
presently
as
he
stood
his
broad
back
set
to
the
bole
of
a
tree
his
blue
eyes
lifted
heavenwards
brimful
of
dreams
he
brake
forth
into
a
song
he
had
made
lying
sleepless
upon
his
bed
to
do
it
tall
and
stately
were
the
trees
towering
aloft
nodding
slumberously
in
the
gentle
wind
fair
were
the
flowers
lifting
glad
faces
to
their
and
filling
the
air
with
their
languorous
perfume
yet
naught
was
there
so
comely
to
look
upon
as
beltane
the
smith
standing
in
his
might
his
golden
hair
and
his
lifted
eyes
merrily
the
brook
laughed
and
sang
among
the
willows
leaping
in
over
its
pebbly
bed
sweet
piped
the
birds
in
brake
and
thicket
yet
of
all
their
music
none
was
there
so
good
to
hear
as
the
rich
tones
of
beltane
the
smith
so
thought
the
duchess
helen
of
mortain
where
she
sat
upon
her
white
palfrey
screened
by
the
foliage
seeing
nought
but
this
singer
whose
voice
thrilled
strangely
in
her
ears
and
who
so
good
a
judge
as
helen
the
beautiful
whose
lovers
were
beyond
count
knights
and
nobles
and
princelings
ever
kneeling
at
her
haughty
feet
ever
sighing
forth
vows
of
service
and
adoration
in
whose
honour
many
a
stout
lance
had
shivered
and
many
a
knightly
act
been
wrought
wherefore
i
say
who
so
good
a
judge
as
the
duchess
helen
of
mortain
thus
beltane
the
maker
of
verses
all
ignorant
that
any
heard
save
the
birds
in
the
brake
sang
of
the
glories
of
the
sang
how
the
flowers
feeling
the
first
sweet
promise
of
spring
stirring
within
them
awoke
and
lo
the
frost
was
gone
the
warm
sun
they
had
dreamed
of
through
the
long
winter
was
come
back
the
time
of
their
waiting
passed
away
so
timidly
slowly
they
stole
forth
from
the
dark
unveiling
their
beauties
to
their
lord
the
sun
and
filling
the
world
with
the
fragrance
of
their
worship
somewhat
of
all
this
sang
beltane
whiles
the
duchess
helen
gazed
upon
him
and
wondering
could
this
be
beltane
the
smith
this
tall
youth
this
singer
of
dreams
could
this
indeed
be
the
mighty
wrestler
of
whom
she
had
heard
so
many
tales
of
late
how
that
he
lived
an
anchorite
deep
hidden
in
the
green
hating
the
pomp
and
turmoil
of
cities
and
contemning
women
and
all
their
ways
now
bethinking
her
of
all
this
the
duchess
frowned
for
that
he
was
such
a
goodly
man
and
so
comely
to
look
on
and
frowning
mused
white
chin
on
white
fist
then
she
smiled
as
one
that
hath
a
bright
thought
and
straightway
loosed
the
golden
fillet
that
bound
her
glowing
tresses
so
that
they
fell
about
her
in
all
their
glory
rippling
far
down
her
broidered
habit
then
the
song
being
ended
forth
from
her
cover
rode
the
lady
of
mortain
and
coming
close
where
beltane
leaned
him
in
the
shade
of
the
tree
paused
of
a
sudden
and
started
as
one
that
is
surprised
and
beltane
turning
found
her
beside
him
yet
spake
not
nor
moved
breathless
and
as
one
entranced
he
gazed
upon
her
saw
how
her
long
hair
glowed
a
wondrous
red
the
kisses
of
the
dying
sun
saw
how
her
purpled
gown
belted
at
the
slender
waist
clung
about
the
beauties
of
her
shapely
body
saw
how
the
little
shoe
peeped
forth
from
the
perfumed
mystery
of
its
folds
and
so
stood
speechless
bound
by
the
spell
of
her
beauty
wherefore
at
length
she
spake
to
him
low
and
sweet
and
humble
on
this
wise
art
thou
he
whom
men
call
beltane
the
smith
he
answered
gazing
at
her
lowered
lashes
i
am
beltane
the
smith
for
a
space
she
sat
grave
and
silent
then
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
laughed
level
brows
to
see
the
wonder
in
his
gaze
but
anon
she
falls
and
braided
a
tress
of
hair
white
fingers
ere
she
spoke
is
said
of
thee
that
thou
art
a
hermit
and
live
alone
within
these
solitudes
and
yet
meseemeth
thine
eyes
are
not
a
hermit
eyes
messire
quoth
beltane
with
flushing
cheek
and
eyes
abased
yet
do
i
live
alone
lady
nor
are
thy
ways
and
speech
the
ways
of
common
smith
messire
yet
smith
am
i
in
sooth
lady
and
therewithal
content
now
did
she
look
on
him
drooping
lash
and
languorous
and
shook
her
head
and
sighed
alas
messire
methinks
then
perchance
it
may
be
true
that
thou
for
all
thy
youth
and
despite
thine
eyes
art
a
mocker
of
love
a
despiser
of
women
and
yet
nay
sure
is
not
so
then
did
beltane
the
strong
come
nigh
to
fear
by
reason
of
her
fair
womanhood
and
looked
from
her
to
earth
from
earth
to
sky
and
when
he
would
have
answered
fell
abashed
by
her
wondrous
beauty
nay
lady
indeed
indeed
i
know
of
women
nought
nought
of
myself
but
i
have
heard
tell
that
they
be
using
their
beauty
but
to
lure
the
souls
of
men
from
high
and
noble
things
making
of
love
a
jest
a
sport
and
pastime
but
now
the
duchess
laughed
very
soft
and
sweeter
far
to
beltane
thinking
than
the
rippling
music
of
any
brook
soever
aye
me
messire
anchorite
said
she
smiling
yet
whence
had
you
this
poor
folly
quoth
beltane
gravely
lady
was
from
one
beyond
all
thought
wise
and
learned
a
most
holy
hermit
a
hermit
says
she
then
an
he
told
thee
this
needs
must
he
be
old
and
cold
and
withered
and
beyond
the
age
of
love
knowing
nought
of
women
save
what
memory
doth
haunt
his
evil
past
but
young
art
thou
and
strong
and
should
love
come
to
thee
as
come
methinks
it
may
hearken
to
no
voice
but
the
pleading
of
thine
own
true
heart
messire
she
sighed
art
very
blind
methinks
for
you
sing
the
wonders
of
these
yet
in
thy
song
is
never
a
word
of
love
o
blind
o
blind
for
i
tell
thee
nought
exists
in
this
great
world
but
by
love
behold
now
these
sighing
trees
love
their
lord
the
sun
and
through
the
drear
winter
wait
his
coming
with
yearning
arms
crying
aloud
to
him
in
every
shuddering
blast
the
tale
of
their
great
longing
and
after
some
while
he
comes
and
at
his
advent
they
clothe
themselves
anew
in
all
their
beauty
and
with
his
warm
breath
thrilling
through
each
fibre
put
forth
their
buds
singing
through
all
their
myriad
leaves
the
song
of
their
rejoicing
something
the
like
of
this
messire
is
the
love
a
woman
beareth
to
a
man
the
which
until
he
hath
felt
it
trembling
in
his
heart
he
hath
not
known
the
joy
of
living
but
beltane
answered
smiling
a
little
as
one
that
gloried
in
his
freedom
no
woman
hath
ever
touched
my
heart
yet
have
i
lived
nor
found
it
lonely
hitherto
but
hereupon
resting
her
white
fingers
on
his
arm
she
leaned
nearer
to
him
so
that
he
felt
her
breath
warm
upon
his
cheek
and
there
stole
to
him
the
faint
sweet
perfume
of
her
hair
beware
o
scorner
of
women
for
i
tell
thee
that
ere
much
time
hath
passed
thou
shalt
know
love
aye
in
such
fashion
as
few
men
know
wherefore
i
say
beware
beltane
but
beltane
the
strong
the
mighty
shook
his
head
and
smiled
nay
quoth
he
a
man
heart
may
be
set
on
other
things
flowers
may
seem
to
him
fairer
than
the
fairest
women
and
the
wind
in
trees
sweeter
to
him
than
their
voices
now
as
she
hearkened
the
duchess
helen
grew
angry
yet
straightway
she
dissembled
looking
upon
him
drooping
lashes
soft
and
and
sighing
she
answered
ah
beltane
how
unworthy
are
such
things
of
a
man
love
for
if
he
pluck
them
that
he
may
lay
these
flowers
upon
his
heart
lo
they
fade
and
wither
and
their
beauty
and
fragrance
is
but
a
memory
ah
beltane
when
next
ye
sing
choose
you
a
worthier
theme
of
what
shall
i
sing
said
beltane
very
soft
she
answered
and
with
eyes
abased
think
on
what
i
have
told
thee
and
sing
of
love
and
so
she
sighed
and
looked
on
him
once
then
wheeled
her
palfrey
and
was
gone
up
the
glade
but
beltane
as
he
watched
her
go
was
seized
of
a
sudden
impulse
and
her
running
beseech
thee
cried
he
barring
her
path
tell
me
thy
name
then
helen
the
beautiful
the
wilful
laughed
and
swerved
her
palfrey
minded
to
leave
him
so
but
beltane
sprang
and
caught
the
bridle
tell
me
thy
name
said
he
again
let
me
go
thy
name
tell
me
thy
name
but
the
duchess
laughed
again
and
thinking
to
escape
him
smote
her
horse
so
that
it
started
and
reared
once
it
plunged
and
twice
and
so
stood
trembling
with
beltane
hand
upon
the
bridle
wherefore
a
sudden
anger
came
upon
her
and
bending
her
black
brows
she
raised
her
jewelled
threateningly
but
beltane
only
smiled
and
shook
his
head
saying
unless
i
know
thy
name
thou
shalt
not
fare
forth
of
the
greenwood
so
the
proud
lady
of
mortain
looked
down
upon
beltane
in
amaze
for
there
was
none
in
all
the
duchy
knight
noble
or
princeling
who
dared
gainsay
her
lightest
word
wherefore
i
say
she
stared
upon
this
bold
forest
knave
with
his
golden
hair
and
gentle
eyes
his
curved
lips
and
square
chin
and
in
eyes
and
mouth
and
chin
was
a
look
of
masterfulness
challenging
commanding
and
meeting
that
look
her
heart
leapt
most
strangely
with
sudden
sweet
thrill
so
that
she
lowered
her
gaze
lest
he
should
see
and
when
she
spake
her
voice
was
low
and
very
sweet
tell
me
i
pray
why
seek
you
my
name
and
wherefore
quoth
beltane
soft
and
slow
as
one
that
dreams
i
have
seen
thine
eyes
look
at
me
from
the
flowers
ere
now
have
heard
thy
laughter
in
the
brook
and
found
thy
beauty
in
all
fair
things
methinks
thy
name
should
be
a
most
sweet
name
now
was
it
upon
her
lips
to
tell
him
what
he
asked
but
being
a
woman
she
held
her
peace
for
very
contrariness
and
blushing
beneath
his
gaze
looked
down
and
cried
aloud
and
pointed
to
a
grub
that
crawled
upon
her
habit
so
beltane
loosed
the
bridle
and
in
that
moment
she
laughed
for
very
triumph
and
was
off
galloping
the
trees
yet
as
she
went
she
turned
and
called
to
him
and
the
word
she
called
was
helen
chapter
iv
of
the
love
and
the
grief
of
helen
the
proud
long
stood
beltane
where
she
had
left
him
the
soft
shadows
of
night
deepening
about
him
dreaming
ever
of
her
beauty
of
her
wondrous
hair
and
of
the
little
foot
that
had
peeped
forth
at
him
her
habit
and
full
of
these
thoughts
for
once
he
was
deaf
to
the
soft
voices
of
the
trees
nor
heard
the
merry
chatter
of
the
brook
but
later
upon
his
bed
he
lay
awake
full
long
and
must
needs
remember
yet
another
helen
with
the
same
wondrous
hair
and
eyes
of
mystery
for
whose
sake
men
had
died
and
a
noble
city
burned
and
hereupon
his
heart
grew
strangely
heavy
and
cold
with
an
unknown
dread
days
came
and
went
and
labouring
at
the
forge
or
lying
out
in
the
sunshine
gazing
wistfully
beyond
the
swaying
beltane
would
oft
start
and
turn
his
head
fancying
the
rustle
of
her
garments
in
his
ears
or
her
voice
calling
to
him
from
some
flowery
thicket
and
the
wind
in
the
trees
whispered
helen
and
the
brook
sang
of
helen
and
helen
was
in
his
thoughts
continually
thus
my
beltane
forgot
his
loves
the
flowers
and
sang
no
more
the
wonders
of
the
and
the
duchess
seated
in
state
within
her
great
hall
of
mortain
looking
down
upon
her
knights
and
nobles
would
sigh
for
none
was
there
so
noble
of
form
nor
so
comely
as
beltane
the
smith
hereupon
her
white
brow
would
grow
troubled
and
turning
from
them
all
she
would
gaze
with
deep
unfathomable
eyes
away
across
the
valley
to
where
amid
the
mystery
of
the
trees
beltane
had
his
lonely
dwelling
wherefore
it
was
that
looking
up
one
evening
from
where
he
sat
busied
with
brush
and
colours
upon
a
border
of
wondrous
design
beltane
beheld
her
of
whom
he
was
dreaming
and
she
standing
tall
and
fair
before
him
saw
that
in
his
look
the
which
set
her
heart
at
her
white
breast
most
strangely
yet
fearing
she
should
betray
aught
of
it
she
laughed
gaily
and
mocked
him
as
is
the
way
of
women
saying
well
thou
despiser
of
love
i
hearkened
vainly
for
thy
new
song
as
i
rode
hither
through
the
green
red
grew
my
beltane
cheek
and
he
looked
not
to
her
as
he
answered
lady
i
have
no
new
song
why
then
is
thy
lesson
yet
unlearned
said
she
have
ye
no
love
but
for
birds
and
flowers
and
her
red
lip
curled
scornfully
quoth
beltane
is
there
aught
more
worthy
o
beltane
she
sighed
art
then
so
simple
that
such
will
aye
content
thee
doth
not
thy
heart
hunger
and
cry
within
thee
for
aught
beside
then
beltane
bowed
his
head
and
fumbled
with
his
brush
and
dropped
it
and
ere
he
could
reach
it
she
had
set
her
foot
upon
it
thus
it
chanced
that
his
hand
came
upon
her
foot
and
feeling
it
beneath
his
fingers
he
started
and
drew
away
whereat
she
laughed
low
and
sweet
saying
alack
and
doth
my
foot
affright
thee
and
yet
is
none
so
fierce
and
none
so
large
that
thou
shouldst
fear
it
thus
messire
thou
who
art
so
tall
and
strong
and
a
mighty
wrestler
withal
now
looking
up
he
saw
her
lips
curved
and
scarlet
and
her
eyes
brimful
of
laughter
and
fain
would
he
have
taken
up
the
brush
yet
dared
not
therefore
very
humbly
she
stooped
and
lifting
the
brush
put
it
in
his
hand
then
trembling
the
touch
of
her
soft
fingers
beltane
rose
up
and
that
which
he
had
hidden
deep
within
his
heart
brake
from
him
helen
he
whispered
o
helen
thou
art
so
wondrous
fair
and
belike
of
high
estate
but
as
for
me
i
am
but
what
i
am
behold
me
he
cried
stretching
wide
his
arms
i
am
but
beltane
the
smith
who
is
there
to
love
such
as
i
see
my
hands
be
hard
and
rough
and
would
but
bruise
where
they
should
caress
these
arms
be
unfitted
for
soft
embracements
o
lady
who
is
there
to
love
beltane
the
smith
now
the
duchess
helen
laughed
within
herself
for
very
triumph
yet
her
bosom
thrilled
and
hurried
with
her
breathing
her
cheek
grew
red
and
her
eyes
bright
and
tender
wherefore
she
stooped
low
to
cull
a
flower
ere
she
answered
beltane
she
sighed
beltane
women
are
not
as
thy
flowers
that
embraces
even
such
as
thine
would
crush
them
but
beltane
stooped
his
head
that
he
might
not
behold
the
lure
and
beauty
of
her
and
clenched
his
hands
hard
and
fierce
and
thereafter
spake
thou
art
so
wondrous
fair
said
he
again
and
belike
of
noble
birth
but
as
for
me
i
am
a
smith
awhile
she
stood
turning
the
flower
in
gentle
fingers
yet
looking
upon
him
in
his
might
and
goodly
youth
beholding
his
averted
face
with
its
strong
sweet
mouth
and
masterful
chin
its
curved
nostrils
and
the
dreaming
passion
of
his
eyes
and
when
she
spake
her
voice
was
soft
and
very
sweet
above
all
thou
art
a
man
messire
then
did
my
beltane
lift
his
head
and
saw
how
the
colour
was
deepened
in
her
cheek
and
how
her
tender
eyes
drooped
before
his
tell
me
he
said
is
there
ever
a
woman
to
love
such
a
man
is
there
ever
a
woman
who
would
leave
the
hum
and
glitter
of
cities
to
walk
with
such
as
i
in
the
shadow
of
these
speak
oh
speak
i
do
beseech
thee
thus
said
he
and
stopped
waiting
her
answer
nay
beltane
she
whispered
let
thine
own
heart
speak
me
this
all
blithe
and
glorious
grew
the
world
about
him
as
he
stooped
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
lifting
her
high
against
his
heart
and
in
this
moment
he
forgot
the
teaching
of
ambrose
the
hermit
forgot
all
things
under
heaven
save
the
glory
of
her
beauty
the
drooping
languor
of
her
eyes
and
the
sweet
moist
tremor
of
her
mouth
and
so
he
kissed
her
murmuring
his
kisses
fairer
art
thou
than
all
the
flowers
o
my
love
and
sweeter
thy
breath
than
the
breath
of
flowers
thus
helen
the
proud
the
beautiful
yielded
her
lips
to
his
and
in
all
the
world
for
her
was
nought
save
the
deep
soft
voice
of
beltane
and
his
eyes
and
the
new
sweet
ecstasy
that
thrilled
within
her
surely
nowhere
in
all
the
world
was
there
such
another
man
as
this
so
strong
and
gentle
so
meet
for
love
and
yet
so
virginal
surely
life
might
be
very
fair
here
in
the
green
solitudes
aye
surely
surely
soft
with
distance
came
the
peal
of
bells
stealing
across
the
valley
from
the
great
minster
in
mortain
and
with
the
sound
memory
waked
and
she
bethought
her
of
all
those
knights
and
nobles
who
lived
but
to
do
her
will
and
pleasure
of
mortain
and
the
glory
of
it
and
so
she
sighed
and
stirred
and
looking
at
beltane
sighed
again
quoth
she
is
this
great
love
i
foretold
come
upon
thee
beltane
and
beltane
answered
truly
a
man
hath
not
lived
until
he
hath
felt
a
woman
kisses
upon
his
lips
and
thou
wilt
flout
poor
love
no
more
nay
he
answered
smiling
is
part
of
me
and
must
be
so
henceforth
forever
but
now
she
sighed
again
and
trembled
in
his
arms
and
clasped
him
close
as
one
beset
by
sudden
fear
while
ever
soft
with
distance
came
the
silvery
voices
of
the
bells
low
yet
insistent
sweet
yet
commanding
wherefore
she
sighing
put
him
from
her
why
then
said
she
with
drooping
head
fare
thee
well
messire
nay
see
you
not
methinks
my
task
is
done
and
it
hath
been
a
pleasing
task
this
of
teaching
thee
to
love
o
would
you
had
not
learned
so
soon
fare
thee
well
beltane
but
beltane
looked
upon
her
as
one
in
deep
amaze
his
arms
fell
from
her
and
he
stepped
back
and
so
stood
very
still
and
as
he
gazed
a
growing
horror
dawned
within
his
eyes
what
art
thou
he
whispered
nay
beltane
she
murmured
ah
look
not
so
who
art
thou
and
what
he
said
nay
did
i
not
tell
thee
at
the
first
i
am
helen
hast
thou
not
known
i
am
helen
helen
of
mortain
thou
thou
art
the
duchess
helen
said
beltane
with
stiffening
lips
thou
the
duchess
and
i
a
smith
and
he
laughed
short
and
fierce
and
would
have
turned
from
her
but
she
stayed
him
with
quivering
hands
and
not
know
she
questioned
hurriedly
methought
it
was
no
secret
i
would
have
told
thee
ere
this
had
i
known
nay
look
not
so
beltane
thou
dost
love
me
yet
nay
i
do
know
it
and
she
strove
to
smile
but
with
lips
that
quivered
strangely
aye
i
love
thee
helen
of
mortain
though
there
be
many
fair
lords
to
do
that
but
as
for
me
i
am
only
a
smith
and
as
a
smith
greatly
would
i
despise
thee
yet
may
this
not
be
for
as
my
body
is
great
so
is
my
love
go
therefore
thy
work
here
is
done
go
get
thee
to
thy
knightly
lovers
wed
this
duke
who
seeks
thee
do
aught
you
will
but
go
leave
me
to
my
hammers
and
these
green
solitudes
so
spake
he
and
turning
strode
away
looking
not
back
to
where
she
stood
leaning
one
white
hand
against
a
tree
once
she
called
to
him
but
he
heeded
not
walking
ever
with
bowed
head
and
hearing
only
the
tumult
within
him
and
the
throbbing
of
his
wounded
heart
and
now
in
his
pain
needs
must
he
think
of
yet
another
helen
and
of
the
blood
and
agony
of
blazing
troy
town
and
lifting
up
his
hands
to
heaven
he
cried
aloud
alas
that
one
so
fair
should
be
a
thing
so
evil
all
in
haste
beltane
came
to
his
lonely
hut
and
taking
thence
his
cloak
and
great
sword
he
seized
upon
his
mightiest
hammer
and
beat
down
the
roof
of
the
hut
and
drave
in
the
walls
of
it
thereafter
he
hove
the
hammer
into
the
pool
together
with
his
anvil
and
rack
of
tools
and
so
setting
the
sword
in
his
girdle
and
the
cloak
about
him
turned
away
and
plunged
into
the
deeper
shadows
of
the
forest
but
ever
soft
and
faint
with
distance
the
silvery
voices
of
the
bells
stole
upon
the
warm
stilly
air
speaking
of
pomp
and
state
of
pride
and
circumstance
but
now
these
seemed
but
empty
things
and
the
duchess
helen
stood
long
with
bent
head
and
hands
that
strove
to
shut
the
sounds
away
but
in
the
end
she
turned
amid
the
gathering
shadows
and
followed
whither
they
called
but
that
night
sitting
in
state
within
her
great
hall
of
mortain
the
duchess
helen
sighed
deep
and
oft
scarce
heeding
the
courtesies
addressed
to
her
and
little
the
whispered
homage
of
her
guest
duke
ivo
he
the
proudest
and
most
potent
of
all
her
many
wooers
yet
her
cheek
burned
beneath
his
close
regard
and
her
woman
flesh
rebelled
at
his
contact
as
had
never
been
aforetime
thus
of
a
sudden
though
the
meal
was
scarce
begun
she
arose
and
stepped
down
from
the
dais
and
when
her
wondering
ladies
would
have
followed
forbade
them
with
a
gesture
and
so
walking
proud
and
tall
she
passed
out
before
them
whereat
duke
ivo
black
brow
grew
the
blacker
and
he
stared
before
him
with
narrowed
eyes
beholding
which
the
faces
of
my
counsellors
waxed
anxious
and
long
only
winfrida
chiefest
of
the
ladies
watched
the
duke
drooping
lids
and
with
a
smile
upon
her
full
red
lips
now
the
duchess
being
come
to
her
chamber
lifted
her
hands
and
tore
the
ducal
circlet
from
her
brow
and
cast
it
from
her
and
thereafter
laid
by
her
rings
and
jewels
and
coming
to
the
open
casement
fell
there
upon
her
knees
and
reached
forth
her
pale
hands
to
where
across
the
valley
the
dark
forest
stretched
away
ghostly
and
unreal
the
moon
my
beloved
she
whispered
o
my
beloved
and
the
gentle
bore
her
secret
in
its
embrace
away
across
the
valley
to
the
dim
solitudes
of
the
woods
beltane
she
sighed
love
hath
come
into
mine
heart
even
as
it
came
to
thee
when
i
recked
not
of
it
my
beloved
o
my
beloved
anon
she
rose
and
stood
awhile
with
head
bowed
as
one
that
dreams
and
of
a
sudden
her
cheek
glowed
warmly
red
her
breath
caught
and
she
gazed
upon
the
moon
with
eyes
of
yearning
tenderness
thereafter
she
laughed
soft
and
happily
and
snatching
up
a
cloak
set
it
about
her
and
fled
from
the
chamber
so
swift
and
light
of
foot
she
sped
by
hidden
ways
until
she
came
where
old
godric
her
chief
huntsman
busied
himself
trimming
the
shaft
of
a
who
beholding
his
lady
rose
up
in
amaze
godric
said
she
white
hands
upon
his
arm
thou
didst
love
me
or
ever
i
could
walk
aye
verily
thou
hast
said
dear
my
lady
love
you
me
yet
truly
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
thou
hast
heard
godric
how
that
my
counsellors
have
long
desired
me
to
wed
with
duke
ivo
and
do
yet
await
my
answer
to
his
suit
nay
hearken
so
shall
my
mind
be
known
in
the
matter
once
and
for
all
come
my
godric
arm
you
and
saddle
two
horses
come
nay
sweet
my
lady
what
would
ye
fly
hence
with
thee
my
godric
come
the
horses
fly
from
mortain
and
thou
the
duchess
nay
dear
lady
is
madness
bethink
thee
o
dear
my
mistress
o
little
helen
that
i
have
cherished
all
thy
days
bethink
thee
do
not
this
thing
godric
did
not
the
duke
my
father
strictly
charge
thee
to
follow
ever
my
call
aye
my
lady
then
follow
now
and
so
she
turned
and
beckoned
and
godric
perforce
followed
after
hand
in
hand
they
went
the
winding
stair
down
to
the
great
dim
courtyard
that
whispered
to
their
tread
and
thereafter
mounting
in
haste
the
duchess
galloped
from
mortain
unheeding
stern
old
godric
by
her
side
and
with
never
a
look
behind
dreaming
ever
of
beltane
with
cheeks
that
crimsoned
her
hood
fast
and
faster
she
rode
the
pale
moon
her
eyes
ever
gazing
towards
the
gloom
of
the
forest
her
heart
throbbing
quick
as
the
of
her
horse
so
at
last
being
come
to
that
glade
whereby
beltane
had
his
dwelling
she
lighted
down
and
bidding
godric
wait
stole
forward
alone
autumn
was
at
hand
and
here
and
there
the
fallen
leaves
rustled
sadly
under
foot
while
the
trees
sighed
and
mourned
together
for
that
the
flowers
so
soon
must
wither
and
die
but
in
the
heart
of
the
duchess
helen
spring
was
come
and
all
things
spake
to
her
of
coming
joys
undreamed
till
now
as
she
hasted
on
flitting
through
the
pallid
moonbeams
that
falling
athwart
rugged
hole
and
branch
splashed
the
gloom
with
radiant
light
once
she
paused
to
listen
but
heard
nought
save
the
murmur
of
the
brook
and
the
faint
stirring
of
leaves
and
now
clear
and
strong
the
tender
radiance
fell
athwart
the
lonely
habitation
and
her
heart
leapt
at
the
sight
her
eyes
grew
moist
and
tender
and
she
hurried
forward
with
flying
steps
then
beholding
the
ruin
of
thatch
and
wall
she
stopped
and
stood
aghast
gazing
and
with
her
heart
numb
in
her
bosom
then
she
shivered
her
proud
head
drooped
and
a
great
sob
brake
from
her
for
that
she
knew
she
was
come
too
late
her
dreams
of
wandering
with
beltane
through
sunny
glades
were
nought
but
dreams
after
all
beltane
the
smith
was
gone
then
a
great
loneliness
and
desolation
came
upon
her
and
sinking
down
at
the
foot
of
that
tree
whereby
he
had
been
wont
to
lean
so
often
her
yearning
arms
crept
about
its
rugged
hole
and
she
lay
there
in
the
passion
of
her
grief
weeping
long
and
bitterly
but
the
gentle
trees
ceased
mourning
over
their
own
coming
sorrow
in
wonder
at
the
sight
and
bending
their
heads
together
seemed
to
whisper
one
to
the
other
saying
he
is
gone
beltane
the
smith
is
gone
chapter
v
which
tells
of
the
story
of
ambrose
the
hermit
deep
deep
within
the
green
twilight
of
the
woods
ambrose
the
hermit
had
builded
him
a
hut
had
built
and
framed
it
of
rude
stones
and
thatched
it
with
grass
and
mosses
and
from
the
door
of
the
hut
he
had
formed
likewise
a
path
strewn
thick
with
jagged
stones
and
sharp
flints
a
cruel
track
the
which
winding
away
through
the
green
led
to
where
upon
a
gentle
eminence
stood
a
wooden
cross
most
artfully
wrought
and
carven
by
the
hermit
skilled
and
loving
fingers
morning
and
evening
winter
and
summer
it
was
his
custom
ever
to
tread
this
painful
way
wetting
the
stones
with
the
blood
of
his
atonement
now
upon
a
certain
rosy
dawn
ere
yet
the
sun
was
up
beltane
standing
amid
the
leaves
saw
the
hermit
issue
forth
of
the
hut
and
with
bowed
head
and
folded
hands
set
out
upon
his
appointed
way
the
cruel
stones
grew
red
beneath
his
feet
yet
he
faltered
not
nor
stayed
until
being
come
to
the
cross
he
kneeled
there
and
with
gaunt
arms
upraised
prayed
long
and
fervently
so
that
the
tears
of
his
passion
streamed
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
and
wetted
the
snow
of
his
beard
in
a
while
having
made
an
end
he
arose
and
being
come
to
his
hut
once
more
he
of
a
sudden
espied
beltane
standing
amid
the
leaves
and
because
he
was
so
fair
and
goodly
to
look
upon
in
his
youth
and
might
the
pale
cheek
of
the
hermit
flushed
and
a
glow
leapt
within
his
sunken
eyes
and
lifting
up
his
hand
he
blessed
him
welcome
to
this
my
solitude
my
son
quoth
he
and
wherefore
hast
thou
tarried
in
thy
coming
i
have
watched
for
thee
these
many
days
come
sit
you
here
beside
me
in
this
blessed
sun
and
tell
me
of
thy
latter
doings
but
the
eyes
of
beltane
were
sad
and
his
tongue
unready
so
that
he
stammered
in
his
speech
looking
ever
upon
the
ground
then
suddenly
to
his
feet
he
strode
before
the
hut
while
ambrose
the
wise
looked
and
saw
yet
spake
not
so
presently
beltane
paused
and
looking
him
within
the
eyes
spake
hurriedly
on
this
wise
most
holy
father
thou
knowest
how
i
have
lived
within
the
greenwood
all
my
days
nor
found
it
lonely
for
i
did
love
it
so
that
i
had
thought
to
die
here
likewise
when
my
time
should
come
yet
now
do
i
know
that
this
shall
never
be
i
go
hence
wherefore
my
son
there
is
come
a
strange
restlessness
upon
me
a
riot
and
fever
of
the
blood
whereby
i
am
filled
with
dreams
and
strange
desires
i
would
go
forth
into
the
great
world
of
men
and
cities
to
take
my
rightful
place
therein
for
until
a
man
hath
loved
and
joyed
and
sorrowed
with
his
fellows
he
knoweth
nought
of
life
perchance
my
son
this
is
but
the
tide
of
youthful
blood
that
tingles
in
thy
veins
or
is
it
that
thou
hast
looked
of
late
within
a
eyes
then
beltane
kneeled
him
at
the
feet
of
ambrose
and
hid
his
face
betwixt
his
knees
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
whiles
yet
a
little
child
father
he
murmured
thou
hast
said
now
looking
down
upon
this
golden
head
ambrose
sighed
and
drew
the
long
curls
through
his
fingers
with
a
wondrous
gentleness
tell
me
of
thy
love
beltane
said
he
forthwith
starting
to
his
feet
beltane
answered
is
many
long
and
weary
months
my
father
and
yet
doth
seem
but
yesterday
she
came
to
me
riding
upon
a
steed
at
first
methought
her
of
the
fairy
kind
thither
drawn
by
my
poor
singing
yet
when
i
looked
on
her
again
i
knew
her
to
be
woman
and
she
was
fair
o
very
fair
my
father
i
may
not
tell
her
beauty
for
was
compounded
of
all
beauteous
things
of
the
snow
of
lilies
the
breath
of
flowers
the
gleam
of
stars
on
moving
waters
the
music
of
streams
the
murmur
of
wind
in
trees
i
can
not
tell
thee
more
but
that
there
is
a
flame
doth
hide
within
her
hair
and
for
her
eyes
o
methinks
is
for
her
eyes
i
do
love
her
most
love
her
aye
my
body
doth
burn
and
thrill
with
love
alas
poor
fool
alas
it
should
be
so
but
for
that
she
is
proud
and
of
an
high
estate
for
that
i
am
i
a
poor
worker
of
iron
whom
men
call
beltane
the
smith
fit
but
to
sigh
and
sigh
and
forever
sigh
to
dream
of
her
and
nothing
more
so
must
i
go
hence
leaving
the
sweet
silence
of
the
woods
for
the
strife
and
noise
of
cities
learning
to
share
the
burdens
of
my
fellows
see
you
not
my
father
see
you
not
the
way
of
it
so
spake
beltane
hot
and
passionate
striding
to
and
fro
upon
the
sward
while
ambrose
sat
with
bitterness
in
his
heart
but
with
eyes
ineffably
gentle
and
is
this
love
of
thine
so
hopeless
my
beltane
beyond
all
thought
she
is
the
duchess
helen
of
mortain
now
for
a
while
the
hermit
spake
not
sitting
chin
in
hand
as
one
who
halts
betwixt
two
courses
is
strange
he
said
at
length
and
passing
strange
yet
since
she
and
she
so
much
above
thee
wherefore
would
ye
leave
the
tender
twilight
of
these
forests
quoth
beltane
sighing
my
father
i
tell
thee
these
woods
be
full
of
love
and
her
she
looketh
at
me
from
the
flowers
and
stealeth
to
me
in
their
fragrance
the
very
brooks
do
babble
of
her
beauty
each
leaf
doth
find
a
little
voice
to
whisper
of
her
and
everywhere
is
love
and
love
and
love
so
needs
must
i
away
and
think
you
so
to
escape
this
love
my
beltane
and
the
pain
of
it
nay
my
father
that
were
thing
impossible
for
it
doth
fill
the
universe
so
must
i
needs
remember
it
with
every
breath
i
draw
but
in
the
griefs
and
sorrows
of
others
i
may
perchance
learn
to
bear
mine
own
silent
and
patiently
as
a
man
should
then
ambrose
sighed
and
beckoning
beltane
to
his
knee
laid
his
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
looked
deep
within
his
eyes
beltane
my
son
said
he
i
have
known
thee
from
thy
youth
up
and
well
do
i
know
thou
canst
not
lie
for
thy
heart
is
pure
as
yet
and
uncorrupt
but
now
is
the
thing
i
feared
come
upon
thee
ah
beltane
hast
thou
forgot
all
i
have
told
thee
of
women
and
the
ways
of
women
how
that
their
white
bodies
are
filled
with
all
manner
of
wantonness
their
hands
strong
in
lures
and
enticements
a
woman
in
her
beauty
is
a
fair
thing
to
the
eyes
of
a
man
yet
i
tell
thee
beltane
they
be
snares
of
the
devil
setting
father
son
and
brother
brother
whereby
come
unnatural
murders
and
bloody
wars
and
yet
needs
must
i
love
her
still
my
father
aye
is
so
sighed
ambrose
is
ever
so
and
as
for
thee
well
do
i
know
the
blood
within
thee
for
a
hot
wild
blood
and
thou
art
young
and
so
it
is
i
fear
for
thee
but
looking
up
beltane
shook
his
head
and
answered
holy
father
thou
art
wise
and
wondrous
learned
in
the
reading
of
books
and
in
the
ancient
wisdoms
and
philosophies
yet
methinks
this
love
is
a
thing
no
book
can
teach
thee
a
truth
a
man
must
needs
find
out
for
himself
and
think
you
i
know
nought
of
love
beltane
the
pain
and
joy
of
it
and
the
shame
thou
seest
me
a
poor
old
man
and
feeble
bent
with
years
and
suffering
one
who
but
waiteth
for
the
time
when
my
grievous
sin
shall
be
atoned
for
and
god
in
his
sweet
clemency
shall
ease
me
of
this
burden
of
life
yet
do
i
tell
thee
there
was
a
time
when
this
frail
body
was
strong
and
tall
as
thine
own
when
this
white
hair
was
thick
and
black
and
these
dim
eyes
bold
and
fearless
even
as
thine
ah
beltane
well
do
i
know
women
and
the
ways
of
women
come
sit
you
beside
me
and
because
thou
art
fain
to
go
into
the
world
and
play
thy
man
part
so
now
will
i
tell
thee
that
the
which
i
had
thought
to
bear
with
me
to
the
grave
then
ambrose
the
hermit
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
began
to
speak
on
this
wise
upon
a
time
were
two
brothers
nobles
of
a
great
house
and
following
each
alike
lovers
of
peace
yet
each
terrible
in
war
the
name
of
the
one
was
johan
and
of
the
other
beltane
now
beltane
being
elder
was
duke
of
that
country
and
the
country
maintained
peace
within
its
borders
and
the
people
thereof
waxed
rich
and
happy
and
because
these
twain
loved
each
other
passing
well
the
way
of
the
one
was
ever
the
way
of
the
other
so
that
they
dwelt
together
in
a
wondrous
amity
and
as
their
hearts
were
pure
and
strong
so
waxed
they
in
body
so
that
there
was
none
could
cope
with
them
at
nor
bear
up
against
the
might
of
their
lances
and
o
methinks
in
all
this
fair
world
nought
was
there
fairer
than
the
love
of
these
two
brethren
now
it
befell
upon
a
day
that
they
set
out
with
a
goodly
company
to
attend
a
tourney
in
a
certain
town
whither
likewise
were
come
many
knights
of
renown
nobles
and
princes
beyond
count
eager
to
prove
their
prowess
thither
drawn
by
the
fame
of
that
fair
lady
who
was
to
be
queen
of
beauty
all
lips
spake
of
her
and
the
wonder
of
her
charms
how
that
a
man
could
not
look
within
her
eyes
but
must
needs
fall
into
a
passion
of
love
for
her
but
the
brethren
smiled
and
paid
small
heed
and
so
together
journeyed
to
the
city
the
day
of
the
joust
being
come
forth
they
rode
into
the
lists
side
by
side
each
in
his
triple
mail
and
ponderous
helm
alike
at
all
points
save
for
the
golden
circlet
upon
duke
beltane
shining
casque
and
there
befell
that
day
a
mighty
shivering
of
lances
and
many
a
knightly
deed
was
wrought
but
for
these
brethren
there
was
none
of
all
these
knights
and
nobles
who
might
abide
their
onset
all
day
long
they
together
maintained
the
lists
till
there
none
remained
to
cope
with
them
wherefore
the
marshal
would
have
had
them
run
a
course
together
for
proof
which
was
the
mightier
but
beltane
smiled
and
shook
his
head
saying
it
is
not
meet
that
brother
strive
with
brother
and
johan
said
the
day
doth
rest
with
us
we
will
share
the
glory
together
so
amid
the
acclaim
of
voice
and
trumpet
side
by
side
they
came
to
make
obeisance
to
the
queen
of
beauty
and
gazing
upon
her
they
saw
that
she
was
indeed
of
a
wondrous
beauty
now
in
her
hand
she
held
the
crown
that
should
reward
the
victor
yet
because
they
were
two
she
knew
not
whom
to
choose
wherefore
she
laughed
and
brake
the
crown
asunder
and
gave
to
each
a
half
with
many
fair
words
and
gentle
sayings
but
alas
my
son
from
that
hour
her
beauty
came
betwixt
these
brethren
veiling
their
hearts
one
from
the
other
so
they
tarried
awhile
in
that
fair
city
yet
companied
together
no
more
for
each
was
fain
to
walk
apart
dreaming
of
this
woman
and
the
beauty
of
her
and
each
by
stealth
wooed
her
to
wife
at
last
upon
an
evening
came
johan
to
his
brother
and
taking
from
his
bosom
the
half
of
the
crown
he
had
won
kissed
it
and
gave
it
to
beltane
saying
half
of
a
crown
availeth
no
man
take
therefore
my
half
and
join
it
with
thine
for
well
do
i
know
thy
heart
my
brother
and
thou
art
the
elder
and
duke
go
therefore
and
woo
this
lady
to
wife
and
god
speed
thee
my
lord
but
beltane
said
were
it
in
me
to
take
advantage
of
my
years
thus
doth
age
or
rank
make
a
man
love
more
worthy
so
get
thee
to
thy
wooing
my
brother
and
heaven
blessing
on
thee
then
grew
johan
full
of
joy
saying
be
it
dear
my
brother
but
am
i
come
not
to
thee
within
three
days
at
sunset
then
shalt
know
that
my
wooing
hath
not
prospered
upon
the
third
day
therefore
beltane
the
duke
girded
on
his
armour
and
made
ready
to
ride
unto
his
own
demesne
yet
tarried
until
sunset
according
to
his
word
but
his
brother
johan
came
not
therefore
he
in
turn
rode
upon
his
wooing
and
came
unto
the
presence
in
hauberk
of
mail
and
thus
ungently
clad
wooed
her
as
one
in
haste
to
be
gone
telling
her
that
this
world
was
no
place
for
a
man
to
sigh
out
his
days
at
a
woman
feet
and
bidding
her
answer
him
or
and
let
him
be
gone
to
his
duty
and
she
whom
so
many
had
wooed
on
bended
knee
spake
him
yea
for
that
a
woman
ways
be
beyond
all
knowledge
and
therewith
gave
her
beauty
to
his
keeping
so
forthwith
were
they
wed
with
much
pomp
and
circumstance
and
so
he
brought
her
to
his
duchy
with
great
joy
and
acclaim
then
would
johan
have
departed
over
seas
but
beltane
ever
dissuaded
him
and
fain
these
brethren
would
have
loved
each
other
as
they
had
done
aforetime
yet
was
the
beauty
of
this
woman
ever
betwixt
them
now
within
that
year
came
news
of
fire
and
sword
upon
the
border
of
cruel
rape
and
murder
so
beltane
sent
forth
his
brother
johan
with
an
army
to
drive
back
the
invaders
and
himself
abode
in
his
great
castle
happy
in
the
love
of
his
fair
young
wife
but
the
war
went
ill
tidings
came
that
johan
his
brother
was
beaten
back
with
much
loss
and
he
himself
sore
wounded
therefore
the
duke
made
ready
to
set
forth
at
the
head
of
a
veteran
company
but
ere
he
rode
a
son
was
born
to
him
so
needs
must
he
come
to
his
wife
in
his
armour
and
beholding
the
child
kissed
him
thereafter
duke
beltane
rode
to
the
war
with
a
glad
heart
and
fell
upon
his
enemies
and
scattered
them
and
pursued
them
far
and
smote
them
even
to
their
own
gates
but
in
the
hour
of
his
triumph
he
fell
by
treachery
into
the
hands
of
his
cruelest
enemy
how
it
mattereth
not
and
for
a
space
was
lost
to
sight
and
memory
but
as
for
johan
the
duke
brother
he
lay
long
sick
of
his
wounds
so
came
the
duchess
and
ministered
to
him
and
she
was
fair
and
passing
fair
and
he
was
young
and
when
his
strength
was
come
again
each
day
was
johan
minded
to
ride
forth
and
seek
the
duke
his
brother
but
he
was
young
and
she
passing
fair
wherefore
he
tarried
still
bound
by
the
lure
of
her
beauty
and
upon
a
soft
and
stilly
eve
as
they
walked
together
in
the
garden
she
wooed
johan
with
tender
look
and
word
and
wreathed
her
white
arms
about
him
and
gave
to
his
her
mouth
and
in
that
moment
came
one
fierce
and
wild
of
aspect
in
dinted
casque
and
rusty
mail
who
stood
and
watched
ah
god
here
for
a
while
the
hermit
ambrose
stayed
his
tale
and
beltane
saw
his
brow
was
moist
and
that
his
thin
hands
clenched
and
wrung
each
other
so
thus
my
son
came
duke
beltane
home
again
he
and
his
esquire
sir
benedict
of
bourne
alone
of
all
his
company
each
alike
worn
with
hardship
and
spent
with
wounds
but
now
was
the
duke
stricken
of
a
greater
pain
and
leaned
him
upon
the
shoulder
of
his
esquire
faint
and
sick
of
soul
and
knew
an
anguish
deeper
than
any
flesh
may
know
then
of
a
sudden
madness
came
upon
him
and
breaking
from
the
mailed
arms
that
held
him
he
came
to
the
courtyard
and
to
the
hall
beyond
hurling
aside
all
such
as
sought
to
stay
him
and
so
reached
at
last
my
lady
bower
his
mailed
feet
ringing
upon
the
atones
and
looking
up
the
duchess
saw
and
cried
aloud
and
stood
thereafter
pale
and
speechless
and
wide
of
eye
while
johan
cheek
grew
red
and
in
his
look
was
shame
then
the
duke
put
up
his
vizor
and
when
he
spake
his
voice
was
harsh
and
strange
good
brother
said
he
now
i
pray
you
get
you
horse
and
armour
and
wait
me
in
the
courtyard
yet
first
must
i
greet
this
my
lady
wife
so
johan
turned
with
hanging
head
and
went
from
the
chamber
then
said
the
duke
laughing
in
his
madness
lady
the
power
of
a
beauty
for
i
loved
a
noble
brother
once
a
spotless
knight
whose
honour
reached
high
as
heaven
but
thou
hast
made
of
him
a
something
foul
and
base
traitor
to
me
and
to
his
own
sweet
name
and
is
for
this
i
will
requite
thee
but
the
duchess
spake
not
nor
blenched
even
when
the
dagger
gleamed
to
strike
o
sweet
god
of
mercy
to
strike
but
in
that
moment
came
benedict
of
bourne
and
leapt
betwixt
and
took
the
blow
upon
his
cheek
and
stanching
the
blood
within
his
tattered
cried
duke
because
i
love
thee
shalt
thou
do
this
thing
until
thou
first
slay
me
a
while
the
duke
stood
in
amaze
then
turned
and
strode
away
down
the
great
stair
and
coming
to
the
courtyard
beheld
his
brother
johan
armed
at
all
points
and
mounted
and
with
another
horse
equipped
near
by
so
the
duke
laughed
and
closed
his
vizor
and
his
laughter
boomed
hollow
within
his
rusty
casque
and
leaping
to
the
saddle
rode
to
the
end
of
the
great
and
wheeling
couched
his
lance
so
these
brethren
who
had
loved
each
other
so
well
spurred
upon
each
other
with
levelled
lances
but
or
ever
the
shock
came
o
my
son
my
son
johan
rose
high
in
his
stirrups
and
cried
aloud
the
of
his
house
arise
i
shall
arise
and
with
the
cry
tossed
aside
his
lance
lest
he
might
harm
the
duke
his
brother
o
sweet
clemency
of
christ
and
crashed
to
earth
and
lay
there
very
still
and
silent
then
the
duke
dismounted
and
watched
by
esquires
and
came
and
knelt
beside
his
brother
and
laid
aside
his
brother
riven
helm
and
beholding
his
comely
features
torn
and
marred
and
his
golden
hair
all
hatefully
bedabbled
felt
his
heart
burst
in
sunder
and
he
groaned
and
rising
to
stumbling
feet
came
to
his
horse
and
mounted
and
rode
away
grim
portcullis
and
over
echoing
drawbridge
yet
whithersoever
he
looked
he
saw
only
his
brother
dead
face
pale
and
bloody
and
fain
he
would
have
prayed
but
could
not
and
so
he
came
into
the
forest
all
day
long
he
rode
beneath
the
trees
careless
of
his
going
conscious
only
that
benedict
of
bourne
rode
behind
with
his
bloody
wrapped
about
him
but
on
rode
the
duke
with
hanging
head
and
listless
hands
for
before
his
haggard
eyes
was
ever
the
pale
dead
face
of
johan
his
brother
now
as
the
moon
rose
they
came
to
a
brook
that
whispered
amid
the
shadows
and
here
his
stayed
to
drink
then
came
sir
benedict
of
bourne
beside
him
duke
said
he
hast
thou
in
thy
mind
to
do
know
not
said
the
duke
methinks
sweet
to
die
what
of
the
babe
lord
duke
and
speaking
sir
benedict
drew
aside
his
cloak
and
showed
the
babe
asleep
beneath
but
looking
upon
its
innocence
the
duke
cried
out
and
hid
his
face
for
the
babe
golden
curls
were
dabbled
with
the
blood
from
sir
benedict
wound
and
looked
even
as
had
the
face
of
the
dead
johan
yet
in
a
while
the
duke
reached
out
and
took
the
child
and
setting
it
against
his
breast
turned
his
horse
said
sir
benedict
do
we
ride
lord
duke
then
spake
the
duke
on
this
wise
benedict
duke
beltane
is
no
more
the
stroke
that
slew
my
brother
johan
killed
duke
beltane
also
but
as
for
you
get
you
to
pentavalon
and
say
the
duke
is
dead
in
proof
whereof
take
you
this
my
ring
and
so
farewell
then
my
beltane
god
guiding
me
i
brought
thee
to
these
solitudes
for
i
am
he
that
was
the
duke
beltane
and
thou
art
my
son
indeed
chapter
vi
how
beltane
fared
forth
of
the
green
thus
spake
the
hermit
ambrose
and
having
made
an
end
sat
thereafter
with
his
head
bowed
upon
his
hands
while
beltane
stood
yet
seeing
not
and
with
lips
apart
yet
dumb
by
reason
of
the
wonder
of
it
therefore
in
a
while
the
hermit
spake
again
thus
did
we
live
together
thou
and
i
dear
son
and
i
loved
thee
well
my
beltane
with
each
succeeding
day
i
loved
thee
better
for
as
thine
understanding
grew
so
grew
my
love
for
thee
therefore
so
soon
as
thou
wert
of
an
age
set
in
thy
strength
and
able
to
thine
own
support
i
tore
myself
from
thy
sweet
fellowship
and
lived
alone
lest
having
thee
i
might
come
nigh
to
happiness
then
beltane
sank
upon
his
knees
and
caught
the
hermit
wasted
hands
and
kissed
them
oft
saying
much
hast
thou
suffered
o
my
father
but
now
am
i
come
to
thee
again
and
knowing
all
things
here
will
i
bide
and
leave
thee
nevermore
now
in
the
hermit
pale
cheek
came
a
faint
and
sudden
glow
and
in
his
eyes
a
light
not
of
the
sun
bethink
thee
boy
said
he
the
blood
within
thy
veins
is
noble
for
since
thou
art
my
son
so
an
thou
dost
leave
me
and
seek
thy
destiny
thou
shalt
perchance
be
duke
of
pentavalon
an
god
will
it
so
but
beltane
shook
his
head
quoth
he
my
father
i
am
a
smith
and
smith
am
i
content
to
be
since
thou
lord
duke
art
my
father
so
now
will
i
abide
with
thee
and
love
and
honour
thee
and
be
thy
son
indeed
then
rose
the
hermit
ambrose
to
his
feet
and
spake
with
eyes
uplifted
now
glory
be
to
god
who
in
his
mercy
hath
made
of
thee
a
man
my
beltane
clean
of
soul
and
innocent
yet
strong
of
arm
to
lift
and
succour
the
distressed
and
therefore
it
is
that
you
must
leave
me
my
for
there
be
those
whose
need
of
thee
is
greater
even
than
mine
nay
dear
my
father
how
may
this
be
now
hereupon
ambrose
the
hermit
stood
awhile
with
bent
head
and
spake
not
only
he
sighed
full
oft
and
wrung
his
hands
i
thought
but
of
myself
he
groaned
great
sorrow
is
greatly
selfish
alas
my
son
twenty
weary
years
have
i
lived
here
suing
god
forgiveness
and
for
twenty
bitter
years
pentavalon
hath
groaned
shameful
wrong
and
death
in
many
hateful
shapes
o
god
have
mercy
on
a
sinner
who
thought
but
on
himself
list
my
son
o
list
on
a
day
as
i
kneeled
before
yon
cross
came
one
in
knightly
armour
and
upon
his
face
the
links
of
his
camail
i
saw
a
great
scar
the
scar
this
hand
had
wrought
and
even
as
i
knew
sir
benedict
in
that
same
moment
he
knew
me
and
gave
a
joyous
cry
and
came
and
fell
upon
his
knee
and
kissed
my
hand
as
of
old
thereafter
we
talked
and
he
told
me
many
a
woeful
tale
of
pentavalon
and
of
its
misery
how
when
i
was
gone
rose
bitter
fight
and
faction
barons
and
knights
striving
together
which
should
be
duke
in
the
midst
of
the
which
disorders
came
one
from
beyond
seas
whom
men
called
ivo
who
by
might
of
sword
and
cunning
tongue
made
himself
duke
in
my
place
sir
benedict
told
of
a
fierce
and
iron
rule
of
the
pillage
and
ravishment
of
town
and
city
of
outrage
and
injustice
of
rack
and
flame
and
gibbet
of
a
people
groaning
a
thousand
cruel
wrongs
then
indeed
did
i
see
that
my
one
great
sin
a
thousand
other
sins
had
bred
and
was
i
full
of
bitter
sorrow
and
anguish
and
in
my
anguish
i
thought
on
thee
and
sent
to
thee
sir
benedict
and
watched
thee
wrestle
and
at
stroke
of
sword
and
praised
god
for
thy
goodly
might
and
strength
for
o
dear
my
son
meseemeth
that
god
hath
raised
thee
up
to
succour
these
afflicted
to
shield
the
weak
and
helpless
hath
made
thee
great
and
mightier
than
most
to
smite
evil
that
it
may
flee
before
thee
so
in
thee
shall
my
youth
be
renewed
and
my
sins
peradventure
purged
away
father
said
beltane
rising
his
blue
eyes
wide
his
strong
hands
o
my
father
then
ambrose
clasped
those
quivering
hands
and
kissed
those
wide
and
troubled
eyes
and
spake
thereafter
slow
and
soft
now
shall
i
live
henceforth
in
thee
my
son
glorying
in
thy
deeds
hereafter
and
if
thou
must
needs
bleed
then
shall
my
heart
bleed
with
thee
or
if
thou
meet
with
death
my
beltane
then
shall
this
heart
of
mine
die
with
thee
thus
speaking
the
hermit
drew
the
sword
from
beltane
girdle
and
held
the
great
blade
towards
heaven
behold
my
son
said
he
the
motto
of
our
house
will
arise
so
now
shalt
thou
arise
indeed
that
thy
destiny
may
be
fulfilled
take
hold
upon
thy
manhood
my
get
thee
to
woeful
pentavalon
and
beholding
its
sorrows
seek
how
they
may
be
assuaged
now
my
beltane
all
is
said
when
wilt
thou
leave
thy
father
quoth
beltane
gathering
his
cloak
about
him
an
so
it
be
thy
wish
my
father
then
will
i
go
this
hour
then
ambrose
brought
beltane
into
his
humble
dwelling
where
was
a
coffer
wrought
by
his
own
skilful
fingers
and
from
this
coffer
he
drew
forth
a
suit
of
triple
mail
wondrously
fashioned
beholding
the
which
beltane
eyes
glistened
because
of
the
excellence
of
its
craftsmanship
behold
quoth
the
hermit
is
an
armour
worthy
of
a
king
light
is
it
yet
marvellous
strong
and
hath
been
well
tried
in
many
a
desperate
affray
is
twenty
years
since
these
limbs
bore
it
yet
see
i
have
kept
it
bright
from
rust
lest
peradventure
pentavalon
should
need
thee
to
raise
again
the
battle
cry
of
thy
house
and
lead
her
men
to
war
and
alas
dear
son
that
day
is
now
pentavalon
calls
to
thee
from
out
the
gloom
of
dungeon
from
the
anguish
of
flame
and
rack
and
gibbet
from
hearth
and
shameful
grave
she
calls
thee
so
my
beltane
come
and
let
me
arm
thee
and
there
within
his
little
hut
the
hermit
ambrose
duke
of
pentavalon
that
was
girt
the
armour
upon
beltane
the
mighty
duke
of
pentavalon
to
be
if
so
god
willed
first
the
gambeson
of
stuffed
and
quilted
leather
and
thereafter
coifed
hauberk
and
chausses
with
wide
clamped
with
broad
plates
of
silver
and
studs
of
gold
until
my
beltane
stood
up
armed
in
shining
mail
from
head
to
foot
then
brought
ambrose
a
wallet
wherein
were
six
gold
pieces
and
put
it
in
his
hand
saying
these
have
i
kept
against
this
day
my
beltane
take
them
to
aid
thee
on
thy
journey
for
the
county
of
bourne
lieth
far
to
the
south
do
i
then
journey
to
bourne
my
father
aye
to
sir
benedict
who
yet
doth
hold
the
great
keep
of
thrasfordham
many
sieges
hath
he
withstood
and
daily
men
flee
to
him
stricken
men
runaway
serfs
and
outlaws
from
the
green
all
such
masterless
men
as
lie
in
fear
of
their
lives
said
beltane
slow
and
thoughtful
there
be
many
outlaws
within
the
green
wild
men
and
sturdy
fighters
as
i
heard
hath
sir
benedict
many
men
my
father
alas
a
pitiful
few
and
black
ivo
can
muster
bows
and
lances
by
the
ten
thousand
yet
doth
sir
benedict
withstand
them
all
my
father
yet
must
he
keep
ever
within
bourne
beltane
all
pentavalon
save
bourne
lieth
ivo
iron
foot
ruled
by
his
fierce
nobles
and
they
be
strong
and
many
whom
sir
benedict
is
helpless
in
the
field
is
but
five
years
agone
since
ivo
gave
up
fair
belsaye
town
to
ravishment
and
pillage
and
thereafter
builded
him
a
mighty
gallows
over
against
it
and
hanged
many
men
thereon
now
hereupon
of
a
sudden
beltane
clenched
his
hands
and
fell
upon
his
knees
father
said
he
pentavalon
indeed
doth
cry
so
must
i
now
arise
and
go
unto
her
give
me
thy
blessing
that
i
may
go
then
the
hermit
laid
his
hands
upon
beltane
golden
head
and
blessed
him
and
whispered
awhile
in
passionate
prayer
thereafter
beltane
arose
and
together
they
came
out
into
the
sunshine
south
and
by
west
must
you
march
dear
son
and
god
methinks
shall
go
beside
thee
for
thy
feet
shall
tread
a
path
where
death
shall
lie
in
wait
for
thee
let
thine
eyes
be
watchful
therefore
and
thine
ears
quick
to
hear
hearken
you
to
all
men
yet
speak
you
few
words
and
soft
but
when
you
act
let
your
deeds
shout
unto
heaven
that
all
pentavalon
may
know
a
man
is
come
to
lead
them
who
fears
only
god
and
so
my
beltane
come
kiss
me
boy
our
next
kiss
perchance
shall
be
in
heaven
and
thus
they
kissed
and
looked
within
each
other
eyes
then
beltane
turned
him
swift
and
sudden
and
strode
upon
his
way
but
in
a
little
looking
back
he
saw
his
father
kneeling
before
the
cross
with
long
gaunt
arms
upraised
to
heaven
chapter
vii
how
beltane
talked
with
one
hight
giles
brabblecombe
who
was
a
notable
and
learned
archer
the
morning
was
yet
young
when
my
beltane
fared
forth
into
the
world
a
joyous
golden
morning
trilling
with
the
glad
song
of
birds
and
rich
with
a
thousand
dewy
scents
a
fair
sweet
joyous
world
it
was
indeed
whose
glories
stealing
in
at
eye
and
ear
filled
him
with
their
gladness
on
strode
my
beltane
by
rippling
brook
and
sleepy
pool
with
step
swift
and
light
and
eyes
wide
and
shining
threading
an
unerring
course
as
only
a
forester
might
now
crossing
some
broad
and
sunny
glade
where
dawn
yet
lingered
in
rosy
mist
anon
plunging
into
the
green
twilight
of
dell
and
dingle
through
tangled
brush
and
scented
bracken
gemmed
yet
with
dewy
fire
by
marsh
and
swamp
and
lichened
rock
until
he
came
out
upon
the
forest
road
that
great
road
laid
by
the
iron
men
of
rome
but
now
little
better
than
a
grassy
track
yet
here
and
there
with
mossy
stone
set
up
to
the
glory
of
proud
emperor
and
hardy
centurion
long
since
dust
and
ashes
a
rutted
track
indeed
but
leading
ever
on
mighty
trees
over
hill
and
dale
towards
the
blue
mystery
beyond
now
in
a
while
being
come
to
the
brow
of
a
hill
needs
must
my
beltane
pause
to
look
back
upon
the
woodlands
he
had
loved
so
well
and
sighing
he
stretched
his
arms
thitherward
and
lo
out
of
the
soft
twilight
of
the
green
stole
a
gentle
wind
full
of
the
scent
of
root
and
herb
and
the
fresh
sweet
smell
of
earth
a
cool
soft
wind
that
stirred
the
golden
hair
at
his
temples
like
a
caress
and
so
was
gone
for
a
while
he
stood
thus
gazing
towards
where
he
knew
his
father
yet
knelt
in
prayer
for
him
then
turned
he
slowly
and
went
his
appointed
way
thus
did
beltane
bid
farewell
to
the
greenwood
and
to
woodland
things
and
thus
did
the
green
spirit
of
the
woods
send
forth
a
gentle
wind
to
kiss
him
on
the
brow
ere
he
went
out
into
the
world
of
men
and
cities
now
after
some
while
as
he
walked
beltane
was
aware
of
the
silvery
tinkle
of
bells
and
therewith
a
full
sweet
voice
upraised
in
song
and
the
song
was
right
merry
and
the
words
likewise
o
shall
my
lust
for
the
bowl
decline
nor
my
love
for
my
good
long
bow
for
as
bow
to
the
shaft
and
as
bowl
to
the
wine
is
a
maid
to
a
man
i
trow
looking
about
beltane
saw
the
singer
a
comely
fellow
whose
long
legs
bestrode
a
plump
ass
a
lusty
man
he
was
clad
in
shirt
of
mail
and
with
a
feather
of
green
brooched
to
his
escalloped
hood
a
hung
at
his
back
together
with
a
quiver
of
arrows
while
at
his
thigh
swung
a
heavy
sword
now
he
espying
beltane
amid
the
leaves
brought
the
ass
to
a
sudden
halt
and
clapped
hand
to
the
pommel
of
his
sword
how
now
goliath
cried
he
vobiscum
and
likewise
come
ye
in
peace
forsooth
or
is
it
to
be
internecinum
though
by
giles
which
is
my
patron
saint
i
care
not
how
it
be
for
mark
ye
cantat
coram
latrone
viator
sir
goliath
the
which
in
the
vulgar
tongue
signifieth
that
he
who
travels
with
an
empty
purse
laughs
before
the
footpad
moreover
i
have
a
sword
but
beltane
laughed
saying
i
have
no
lust
to
thy
purse
most
learned
bowman
or
indeed
to
aught
of
thine
unless
it
be
thy
company
my
company
quoth
the
bowman
looking
beltane
up
and
down
with
merry
blue
eyes
why
now
do
i
know
thee
for
a
fellow
of
rare
good
judgment
for
my
company
is
of
the
best
in
that
i
have
a
tongue
which
loveth
to
wag
in
jape
or
song
heard
ye
how
the
birds
and
i
were
a
right
blithesome
morn
methinks
what
with
my
song
and
the
song
and
this
poor
ass
bells
aye
and
the
flowers
from
the
bank
yonder
god
give
ye
joy
of
it
tall
brother
as
he
doth
me
and
this
goodly
ass
betwixt
my
knees
patient
beast
now
leaning
on
his
beltane
smiled
and
said
how
came
ye
by
that
same
ass
master
bowman
well
i
met
a
monk
quoth
the
fellow
with
a
gleam
of
white
teeth
o
a
ponderous
monk
brother
of
most
mighty
girth
of
belly
now
as
ye
see
though
this
ass
be
sleek
and
fat
as
an
abbot
she
is
something
small
shall
so
small
a
thing
needs
bear
so
great
a
mountain
flesh
says
i
much
moved
at
the
sight
brother
by
the
blessed
bones
of
giles
which
is
my
patron
saint
brother
so
thereafter
by
dint
of
a
little
persuasion
brother
my
mountainous
monk
to
ease
the
poor
beast
back
presently
got
him
down
and
i
forthwith
got
up
as
being
more
in
proportion
to
her
weight
sweet
beast
o
surely
saw
i
fairer
morn
than
this
and
never
in
so
fair
a
morn
saw
i
fairer
man
than
thou
sir
forester
nor
taller
and
i
have
seen
many
men
in
my
day
wherefore
an
so
ye
will
let
us
company
together
what
time
we
may
is
a
solitary
road
and
the
tongue
is
a
rare
shortener
of
distance
so
beltane
strode
on
beside
this
garrulous
bowman
hearkening
to
his
merry
talk
yet
himself
speaking
short
and
to
the
point
as
was
ever
his
custom
as
thus
bowman
how
do
men
call
thee
tall
brother
beltane
beltane
bowman
ha
is
a
good
name
forsooth
i
heard
worse
and
yet
forsooth
i
heard
better
yet
is
a
fairish
name
serve
as
for
me
giles
brabblecombe
o
the
hills
men
call
me
for
was
in
the
hill
country
i
was
born
thirty
odd
years
agone
since
then
twelve
sieges
have
i
seen
with
skirmishes
and
onfalls
thrice
as
many
death
have
i
beheld
in
many
and
divers
shapes
and
in
experience
of
wounds
and
dangers
am
rich
though
by
giles
my
patron
saint
in
little
else
yet
do
i
love
life
the
better
therefore
and
i
have
read
that
despise
gold
is
to
be
rich
beltane
do
all
bowmen
read
then
bowman
why
look
ye
brother
i
am
not
what
i
was
aforetime
sum
quails
eram
i
was
bred
a
shaveling
a
mumbler
a
brother
i
was
a
monk
but
the
flesh
and
the
devil
made
of
me
a
bowman
heigho
so
wags
the
world
though
methinks
i
am
a
better
bowman
than
ever
i
was
a
monk
having
got
me
some
repute
with
this
my
bow
beltane
shaking
his
head
methinks
thy
choice
was
but
a
sorry
one
for
bowman
laughing
choice
quotha
was
no
choice
was
forced
upon
me
et
i
should
be
chanting
prime
or
matins
at
this
very
hour
but
for
this
tongue
o
mine
god
bless
it
for
when
it
should
have
been
droning
psalms
it
was
forever
lilting
forth
some
blithesome
melody
some
merry
song
of
eyes
and
lips
and
stolen
kisses
in
such
sort
that
the
good
brethren
were
wont
to
gather
round
and
listening
sigh
whereof
it
chanced
i
was
one
night
by
order
of
the
holy
prior
drubbed
forth
of
the
sacred
precincts
so
brother
anselm
became
giles
o
the
bow
the
kind
saints
be
praised
in
especial
holy
saint
giles
which
is
my
patron
saint
for
heed
me
better
the
blue
sky
and
the
sweet
strong
wind
than
the
gloom
and
silence
of
a
cloister
i
had
rather
hide
this
sconce
of
mine
in
a
hood
of
mail
than
in
the
mitre
of
a
lord
bishop
episcopare
good
brother
thus
am
i
a
fighter
and
a
good
fighter
and
a
wise
fighter
having
learned
is
better
to
live
to
fight
than
to
fight
to
live
beltane
and
for
whom
do
ye
fight
bowman
for
him
that
pays
most
obediunt
omnia
brother
beltane
frowning
money
and
nought
beside
bowman
staring
as
what
brother
beltane
the
justice
of
the
cause
wherefore
ye
fight
bowman
justice
quotha
cause
o
innocent
brother
what
have
such
matters
to
do
with
such
as
i
see
you
now
such
lieth
the
case
you
let
us
say
being
a
baron
and
therefore
noble
have
a
mind
to
a
certain
other
baron
castle
or
wife
or
both
the
which
is
more
usual
wherefore
ye
come
to
me
who
am
but
a
plain
bowman
knowing
nought
of
the
case
and
you
chaffer
with
me
for
the
use
of
this
my
body
for
so
much
money
and
thereafter
i
shoot
my
best
on
thy
behalf
as
in
mine
honour
bound
thus
have
i
fought
both
for
and
against
black
ivo
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
his
duchy
of
pentavalon
if
ye
be
minded
to
sell
that
long
sword
o
thine
to
none
better
market
could
ye
come
for
there
be
ever
work
for
such
about
black
ivo
beltane
aye
is
so
i
hear
bowman
nor
shall
ye
anywhere
find
a
doughtier
fighter
than
duke
ivo
nor
a
leader
quicker
to
spy
out
the
vantage
of
position
and
attack
beltane
is
he
so
lusty
a
bowman
with
lance
axe
or
sword
he
hath
no
match
i
have
seen
him
lead
a
charge
i
have
watched
him
fight
afoot
i
have
stormed
behind
him
through
a
breach
and
i
know
of
none
dare
cope
with
him
unless
it
be
sir
pertolepe
the
red
beltane
hast
heard
tell
then
of
benedict
of
bourne
bowman
clapping
hand
to
thigh
now
by
the
blood
and
bones
of
giles
is
so
out
o
the
mouth
of
a
babe
and
suckling
am
i
corrected

yet
who

to
fight
sir
giant
for
i
have
fought
for
him
ere
now
within
his
great
keep
of
thrasfordham
within
bourne
but
an
ye
seek

his
is
but
a
poor
service
where
a
man
shall
come
by
harder
knocks
than
good
broad
pieces
beltane
and
yet
thy
cunning
and
all
thy
warring
thy
purse
goeth
empty
bowman
my
purse
sir
dove
aye
i
told
thee
so
for
that
i
am
by
nature
cautious
mos

but
thy
dove

are
honest
eyes
so
now
shall
you
know
that
hid
within
the
lining
of
this
my
left
boot

eighty
and
nine
gold
pieces
and
in
my
right
a
ring
with
stones
of
price
and
moreover
here
behold
a
goodly
chain
so
saying
the
bowman
drew
from
his
bosom
a
gold
chain
thick
and
long
and
heavy
and
held
it
up
in
the
sunlight
i
got
this
sir
dove
together
with
the
ring
and
divers
other
toys
at
the
storming
of
belsaye
five
years
agone
aha
a
right
good
town
is
belsaye
and
growing
rich
and
fat
against
another
plucking
and
how
came
belsaye
to
be
stormed
quoth
giles
the
bowman
eying
his
golden
chain
my
lord
duke
ivo
had
a
mind
to
a
certain
lady
who
was
yet
but
a
merchant
daughter
look
ye
but
she
was
young
and
wondrous
fair
for
duke
ivo
hath
a
quick
eye
and
rare
judgment
in
such
pretty
matters
but
she
and
she
but
a
merchant
daughter
took
it
ill
and
when
duke
ivo
messengers
came
to
bear
her
to
his
presence
she
whined
and
struggled
as
is
ever
woman
way
and
thereafter
in
the
open
street
snatched
a
dagger
and
thereupon
before
her
father
very
eye
did
slay
herself
and
she
but
a
merchant
daughter
whereat
some
plucked
out
sword
and
other
citizens
likewise
and
of
my
lord
messengers
there
none
escaped
save
one
and
he
sore
wounded
so
belsaye
city
shut
its
gates
my
lord
duke
and
set
out
upon
its
walls
yet
my
lord
duke
battered
and
breached
it
for
few
can
match
him
in
a
siege
and
stormed
it
within
three
days
and
by
saint
giles
though
he
lost
the
merchant
daughter
methinks
he
lacked
not
at
all
for
the
women
of
belsaye
are
wondrous
fair
the
rising
sun
made
a
glory
all
about
them
pouring
his
beams
mighty
trees
whose
knotted
branches
dappled
the
way
here
and
there
with
shadow
but
now
beltane
saw
nought
of
it
by
reason
that
he
walked
with
head
and
eyes
that
stared
earthward
moreover
his
hands
were
clenched
and
his
lips
close
and
as
for
giles
the
bow
he
chirrupped
merrily
to
the
ass
and
whistled
full
melodiously
mocking
a
blackbird
that
piped
amid
the
green
yet
in
a
while
he
turned
to
stare
at
beltane
rubbing
at
his
square
shaven
chin
with
strong
brown
fingers
forsooth
quoth
he
nodding
a
lusty
fellow
sir
gentleness
by
the
teeth
of
giles
which
is
my
patron
saint
saw
i
a
goodlier
spread
of
shoulder
nor
such
a
proper
length
of
arm
to
twirl
an
axe
withal
and
thy
legs
like
me
well
hast
the
makings
of
a
right
lusty
in
thee
despite
thy
soft
and
peaceful
look
yet
a
lover
of
peace
am
i
said
beltane
his
head
yet
drooping
peace
quotha
peace
ha
by
all
the
holy
saints
peace
a
soft
word
a
woman
word
a
word
smacking
of
babes
and
milk
out
upon
thee
what
hath
a
man
with
such
an
arm
aye
and
legs
to
do
with
peace
an
you
would
now
i
could
bring
ye
to
good
service
duke
ivo
banner
is
said
he
hath
sworn
this
year
to
burn
thrasfordham
keep
to
hang
benedict
o
the
mark
and
lay
waste
to
bourne
aha
you
shall
see
good
fighting
ivo
banner
sir
dove
then
beltane
raised
his
head
and
spake
swift
and
sudden
on
this
wise
an
i
must
fight
the
which
god
forbid
yet
once
this
my
sword
is
drawn
shall
it
rest
till
i
lie
dead
or
black
ivo
is
no
more
then
did
the
archer
stare
upon
my
beltane
in
amaze
with
eyes
full
wide
and
mouth
agape
nor
spake
he
for
awhile
then
black
ivo
thou
he
cried
and
laughed
amain
go
to
my
tender
youth
said
he
methinks
a
lute
were
better
fitted
to
thy
hand
than
that
great
sword
o
thine
now
beholding
beltane
gloomy
face
he
smiled
within
his
hand
yet
eyed
him
thoughtfully
thereafter
and
so
they
went
with
never
a
word
betwixt
them
but
in
a
while
the
archer
fell
to
snuffing
the
air
and
clapped
beltane
upon
the
shoulder
aha
quoth
he
methinks
we
reach
the
fair
duchy
of
pentavalon
smell
ye
aught
brother
and
now
indeed
beltane
became
aware
of
a
cold
wind
foul
and
noisome
a
deadly
clammy
air
breathing
of
things
corrupt
chilling
the
flesh
with
swift
unthinking
dread
and
halting
in
disgust
he
looked
about
him
left
and
right
above
above
cried
giles
o
the
bow
this
is
sir
country
look
you
heavenward
sir
innocence
then
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
shivering
leaves
overhead
beltane
of
a
sudden
espied
a
naked
foot
a
thing
shrivelled
and
hideous
and
glancing
higher
yet
beheld
a
sight
to
blast
the
sun
from
heaven
now
staring
up
at
the
contorted
horror
of
this
shrivelled
thing
that
once
had
lived
and
laughed
beltane
let
fall
his
staff
and
being
suddenly
sick
and
faint
sank
upon
his
knees
and
covering
his
eyes
crouched
there
in
the
grass
the
while
that
grisly
silent
thing
swayed
to
and
fro
above
him
in
the
gentle
wind
of
morning
and
the
cord
whereby
it
hung
creaked
faintly
how
now
how
now
cried
giles
do
ye
blench
before
this
churlish
carrion
aha
ye
shall
see
the
trees
bear
many
such
hereabouts
get
up
my
qualmish
youth
he
shall
injure
thee
nor
any
man
again
save
by
the
nose
faugh
rise
rise
and
let
us
be
gone
so
presently
beltane
shivering
got
him
to
his
feet
and
looking
up
beheld
upon
the
ragged
breast
a
parchment
with
this
legend
in
fair
good
writing
he
killed
a
deer
then
spake
beltane
pallid
lips
and
do
they
hang
men
for
killing
deer
in
this
country
aye
forsooth
and
very
properly
for
heed
me
your
ragged
rogues
be
a
plenty
but
a
stag
is
a
noble
creature
and
something
scarcer
moreover
they
be
the
duke
by
whose
order
was
this
done
why
the
parchment
beareth
the
badge
of
sir
pertolepe
called
the
red
but
look
you
sir
innocent
no
man
may
kill
a
deer
unless
he
be
of
gentle
blood
and
wherefore
is
so
the
law
and
who
made
the
law
why
as
to
that
quoth
giles
rubbing
his
chin
as
to
that
what
matters
it
to
you
or
me
pah
come
away
lest
i
stifle
but
now
even
as
they
stood
thus
out
of
the
green
came
a
cry
hoarse
at
first
but
rising
ever
higher
until
it
seemed
to
fill
the
world
about
and
set
the
very
leaves
once
it
came
and
twice
and
so
was
gone
then
beltane
trembling
stooped
and
caught
up
his
long
and
seized
the
bowman
in
a
shaking
hand
that
yet
was
strong
and
dragging
him
from
the
ass
all
in
a
moment
plunged
into
the
underbrush
whence
the
cry
had
come
and
in
a
while
they
beheld
a
cottage
upon
whose
threshold
a
child
lay
not
asleep
yet
very
still
and
beyond
the
cottage
his
back
to
a
tree
a
great
hairy
fellow
in
hand
made
play
against
five
others
whose
steel
caps
and
ringed
hauberks
glittered
in
the
sun
close
and
ever
closer
they
beset
the
hairy
man
who
bleeding
at
the
shoulder
yet
swung
his
heavy
staff
but
ever
the
glittering
thrust
more
close
beside
the
man
a
woman
crouched
young
and
of
comely
seeming
despite
wild
hair
and
garments
torn
and
wrenched
who
of
a
sudden
with
another
loud
cry
leapt
before
the
hairy
man
covering
him
with
her
clinging
body
and
in
that
moment
her
scream
died
to
a
choking
gasp
and
she
sank
huddled
a
then
beltane
leapt
the
great
sword
flashing
in
his
grasp
and
smote
the
smiter
and
set
his
feet
upon
the
writhing
body
and
smote
amain
with
terrible
arm
and
his
laughter
rang
out
fierce
and
wild
so
for
a
space
sword
clashed
with
pike
but
ever
beltane
laughing
loud
drave
them
before
him
till
but
two
remained
and
they
writhing
upon
the
sward
then
beltane
turned
to
see
giles
o
the
bow
who
leaned
against
a
tree
near
by
and
pale
look
he
cried
pointing
with
quivering
finger
one
dead
and
one
sore
hurt
saint
giles
save
us
what
have
ye
done
these
be
sir
pertolepe
foresters
behold
his
badge
but
beltane
laughed
how
bowman
dost
blench
before
a
badge
then
i
was
too
meek
and
gentle
for
thee
ere
this
but
now
if
afraid
get
you
gone
art
surely
mad
quoth
giles
the
saints
be
my
witness
here
was
no
act
of
mine
so
saying
he
turned
away
and
hasted
through
the
green
now
when
the
bowman
was
gone
beltane
turned
him
to
the
hairy
man
who
yet
kneeled
beside
the
body
of
the
woman
said
he
good
fellow
is
there
aught
i
may
do
for
thee
wife
and
child
and
dead
the
man
muttered
child
and
wife
and
dead
a
week
ago
my
brother
and
now
the
child
and
then
the
wife
child
and
wife
and
brother
and
dead
then
beltane
came
minded
to
aid
him
with
the
woman
but
the
hairy
man
sprang
before
her
swinging
his
great
staff
and
muttering
in
his
beard
therefore
beltane
sick
at
heart
turned
him
away
and
in
a
while
being
come
to
the
road
once
more
he
became
aware
that
he
yet
grasped
his
sword
and
beheld
its
bright
steel
dimmed
here
and
there
with
blood
and
as
he
gazed
his
brow
grew
dark
and
troubled
is
thus
have
i
made
beginning
he
sighed
so
now
god
aiding
me
will
i
rest
peace
be
come
again
and
tyranny
made
an
end
of
then
very
solemnly
did
my
beltane
kneel
him
beside
the
way
and
lifting
the
cross
hilt
of
his
sword
to
heaven
kissed
it
and
thereafter
rose
and
so
having
cleansed
the
steel
within
the
earth
he
sheathed
the
long
blade
and
went
slowfooted
upon
his
way
chapter
viii
how
beltane
held
discourse
with
a
black
friar
the
sun
was
high
and
by
his
shadow
beltane
judged
it
the
noon
hour
very
hot
and
very
still
it
was
for
the
wind
had
died
and
leaf
and
twig
hung
motionless
as
though
asleep
and
presently
as
he
went
a
sound
stole
upon
the
stillness
a
sound
soft
and
beyond
all
things
pleasant
to
hear
the
murmurous
ripple
of
running
water
near
by
going
aside
into
the
green
therefore
beltane
came
unto
a
brook
and
here
screened
from
the
sun
shady
willows
he
laid
him
down
to
drink
and
to
bathe
face
and
hands
in
the
cool
water
now
as
he
lay
thus
staring
into
the
hurrying
waters
of
the
brook
there
came
to
him
the
clicking
of
sandalled
feet
and
glancing
up
he
beheld
one
clad
as
a
black
friar
a
fat
man
he
was
jolly
of
figure
and
mightily
round
his
nose
was
bulbous
and
he
had
a
drooping
lip
peace
be
unto
thee
my
son
quoth
he
breathing
short
and
loud
an
evil
day
for
a
fat
man
who
hath
been
most
basely
bereft
of
a
goodly
ass
holy
saint
dunstan
how
i
gasp
and
putting
back
the
cowl
from
his
tonsured
crown
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
mopped
his
face
hearkee
now
good
youth
hath
there
passed
thee
by
ever
a
ribald
in
an
escalloped
hood
an
unhallowed
scurvy
archer
knave
astride
a
fair
white
ass
my
son
truly
nodded
beltane
we
parted
company
scarce
an
hour
since
the
friar
sat
him
down
in
the
shade
of
the
willows
and
sighing
mopped
his
face
again
quoth
he
now
may
the
curse
of
saint
augustine
saint
benedict
saint
cuthbert
and
saint
dominic
light
upon
him
for
a
lewd
fellow
a
a
thieving
dog
who
hath
no
regard
for
holy
church
forsooth
a
most
vicious
rogue
nulla
virtute
redemptum
a
good
friar
thy
tongue
is
something
harsh
methinks
here
be
four
saints
with
as
many
curses
and
all
for
one
small
ass
the
friar
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
sighed
was
a
goodly
ass
my
son
a
fair
and
gentle
beast
and
of
an
easy
gait
and
i
am
one
that
loveth
not
to
trip
it
in
the
dust
moreover
the
property
of
holy
church
to
take
from
thy
fellow
is
evil
to
steal
from
thy
lord
is
worse
but
to
ravish
from
holy
church
sacrilege
is
foul
blasphemy
thrice
aye
thirty
times
damned
and
beyond
all
hope
of
redemption
so
now
do
i
consign
yon
to
the
lowest
pit
of
acheron
amen
yet
my
son
here
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
is
a
treasure
the
rogue
hath
overlooked
a
pasty
most
rarely
seasoned
that
i
had
this
day
from
my
lord
own
table
is
something
small
for
two
alack
and
yet
stay
who
comes
now
lifting
his
head
beltane
beheld
a
man
bent
and
ragged
who
crept
towards
them
on
a
stick
his
face
was
hid
long
and
matted
hair
but
his
tatters
plainly
showed
the
hideous
nakedness
of
limbs
pinched
and
shrunken
by
famine
while
about
his
neck
was
a
heavy
iron
collar
such
as
all
serfs
must
needs
wear
being
come
near
he
paused
leaning
upon
his
staff
and
cried
out
in
a
strange
cracked
voice
o
ye
that
are
strong
and
may
see
the
blessed
sun
show
pity
on
one
that
is
feeble
and
walketh
ever
in
the
dark
and
now
beneath
the
tangled
hair
beltane
beheld
a
livid
face
in
whose
pale
oval
the
eyeless
sockets
glowed
fierce
and
red
moreover
he
saw
that
the
right
arm
was
but
a
mutilated
stump
whereat
beltane
shivered
and
bowing
his
head
upon
his
hands
closed
his
eyes
oho
cried
the
friar
and
is
it
thou
simon
trouble
ye
the
world
yet
child
of
satan
hereupon
the
blind
man
fell
upon
his
knees
holy
father
he
groaned
clasping
his
withered
arms
upon
his
gaunt
breast
good
friar
gui
i
die
of
hunger
aid
me
lest
i
perish
is
true
i
am
outlaw
and
no
man
may
minister
unto
me
yet
be
merciful
give
me
to
eat
o
gentle
christ
aid

how
cried
the
friar
dare

that

breaker
of
laws
human
and
divine
ye
that
are
murderer
dare
ye
lift

bloody
hands
to

holy

outlaw

rogue

by
holy
church
a
serf
that
hath
raised
hand
his
lord
he
should
have
hanged
when
the
witch
his
daughter
burned
but
that
sir
pertolepe
with
most
rare
mercy
gave
to
the
rogue
his
life
but
sighed

him
to
starve

death
full
as
sure

slower
methinks
come
let

him
i
tell
thee
fond
youth

is
excommunicate
wouldst
have
me
contravene
the
order

holy
church

then
my
beltane
put
his
hand
within
his
pouch
and
taking
thence
a
gold
piece
held
it
out
upon
his
palm
said
he
friar
i
will
buy
the
half
of
thy
pasty
of
thee
hereupon
friar
gui
stared
from
the
gold
to
the
pasty
and
back
again
so
much
quoth
he
forsooth
is
a
noble
pasty
and
yet
nay
nay
tempt
me
not
sathanas
and
closing
his
eyes
he
crossed
himself
then
beltane
took
out
other
two
gold
pieces
and
set
them
in
the
blind
man
bony
hand
saying
take
these
three
gold
pieces
and
buy
you
food
and
thereafter
gold
cried
the
blind
man
gold
now
the
saints
keep
and
bless
thee
young
sir
sweet
jesu
love
thee
ever
and
fain
would
he
have
knelt
to
kiss
my
beltane
feet
but
beltane
raised
him
up
with
gentle
hand
speaking
him
kindly
as
thus
tell
now
i
pray
you
how
came
ye
to
slay
stay
stay
cried
friar
gui
bethink
thee
good
youth
so
much
gold
a
very
fortune
with
so
much
masses
might
be
sung
for
his
wretched
soul
give
it
therefore
to
holy
church
so
shall
he
peradventure
attain
paradise
not
so
answered
beltane
i
had
rather
he
of
a
surety
attain
a
full
belly
sir
friar
then
turning
his
back
upon
the
friar
beltane
questioned
the
blind
man
again
as
thus
tell
me
an
ye
will
how
ye
came
to
shed
blood
and
the
outlaw
kneeling
at
beltane
feet
answered
with
bowed
head
noble
sir
i
had
a
daughter
and
she
was
young
and
fair
therefore
came
my
lord
pertolepe
chief
verderer
to
bear
her
to
my
lord
but
she
cried
to
me
and
i
forgetting
my
duty
to
my
lord
took
my
and
serf
though
i
was
smote
the
chief
verderer
that
he
died
thereafter
but
ere
he
died
he
named
my
daughter
witch
and
when
they
had
burned
her
they
put
out
mine
eyes
and
cut
off
my
hand
and
made
of
me
an
outlaw
so
is
my
sin
very
heavy
upon
me
now
when
the
man
had
made
an
end
beltane
stood
silent
awhile
then
reaching
down
he
aided
the
blind
man
to
his
feet
go
you
to
mortain
said
he
seek
out
the
hermit
ambrose
that
liveth
in
holy
cross
thicket
with
him
shall
you
find
refuge
and
he
methinks
will
surely
win
thy
soul
to
heaven
so
the
blind
man
blessed
my
beltane
and
turning
crept
upon
his
solitary
way
youth
said
the
friar
frowning
up
into
beltane
gentle
eyes
thou
hast
this
day
put
thy
soul
in
jeopardy
the
church
doth
frown
upon
this
thy
deed
and
yet
most
reverend
sir
god
sun
doth
shine
upon
this
my
body
friar
he
who
aideth
an
is
enemy
to
the
good
beltane
yet
he
who
seeketh
to
do
good
to
evil
that
good
may
follow
doeth
no
evil
to
good
friar
ha
thou
art
a
menace
to
the
state
beltane
so
shall
i
be
i
pray
god
the
whiles
this
state
continue
friar
thou
art
either
rogue
or
fool
beltane
well
thou
hast
thy
choice
friar
alack
this
sorry
world
is
full
of
rogues
and
fools
and
beltane
and
friars
friar
who
seek
the
salvation
of
this
wretched
world
beltane
as
how
friar
forsooth
we
meditate
and
pray
beltane
and
eat
friar
aye
verily
we
do
a
little
in
that
way
as
the
custom
is
for
your
reverent
eater
begetteth
a
devout
the
which
mindeth
me
i
grow
an
hungered
yet
will
i
forego
appetite
and
yield
thee
this
fair
pasty
for
but
two
of
thy
gold
pieces
and
look
ye
is
a
noble
pasty
i
had
this
day
from
my
lord
pertolepe
own
table
beltane
that
same
lord
that
showed
mercy
on
yonder
poor
maimed
wretch
know
you
him
friar
in
very
sooth
and
is
a
potent
lord
that
holdeth
me
in
some
esteem
a
most
christian
knight
beltane
that
ravisheth
the
defenceless
whose
hands
be
foul
with
the
blood
of
innocence
friar
how
how
is
a
godly
lord
who
giveth
bounteously
to
holy
church
beltane
who
stealeth
from
the
poor
friar
stealeth
holy
saint
dunstan
dare
ye
speak
thus
of
so
great
a
lord
a
son
of
the
church
a
companion
of
our
noble
duke
steal
forsooth
the
poor
have
nought
to
steal
beltane
they
have
their
lives
friar
not
so
they
and
their
lives
are
their
lord
is
so
the
law
and
beltane
whence
came
this
law
friar
it
came
youth
it
came
aye
of
god
beltane
say
rather
of
the
devil
friar
holy
saint
michael
is
a
blasphemous
youth
never
heard
ears
the
like
o
this
beltane
whence
cometh
poverty
and
famine
friar
is
a
necessary
evil
doth
it
not
say
in
holy
writ
poor
ye
have
always
with
you
beltane
aye
so
shall
ye
ever
until
the
laws
be
amended
so
needs
must
men
starve
and
starve
friar
there
be
worse
things
and
these
serfs
be
born
to
starve
bred
up
to
it
and
is
better
to
starve
here
than
to
perish
hereafter
better
to
purge
the
soul
by
lack
of
meat
than
to
make
of
it
a
fetter
of
the
soul
excellently
said
holy
sir
quoth
beltane
stooping
of
a
sudden
but
for
this
pasty
now
is
a
somewhat
solid
fetter
meseemeth
so
now
do
i
free
thee
of
it
thus
so
saying
my
beltane
dropped
the
pasty
into
the
deeper
waters
of
the
brook
and
thereafter
took
up
his
staff
sir
friar
said
he
behold
is
thy
soul
purged
of
a
pasty
against
the
day
of
judgment
then
beltane
went
on
beside
the
rippling
waters
of
the
brook
but
above
its
plash
and
murmur
rose
the
deeptoned
maledictions
of
friar
gui
chapter
ix
wherein
is
some
account
of
the
philosophy
of
folly
and
the
wisdom
of
a
fool
as
the
day
advanced
the
sun
grew
ever
hotter
birds
chirped
drowsily
from
hedge
and
thicket
and
the
warm
still
air
was
full
of
the
slumberous
drone
of
a
myriad
unseen
wings
therefore
beltane
sought
the
deeper
shade
of
the
woods
and
risking
the
chance
of
roving
thief
or
lurking
followed
a
devious
course
by
reason
of
the
underbrush
now
as
he
walked
him
thus
within
the
cool
green
twilight
watchful
of
eye
and
with
heavy
poised
upon
his
shoulder
he
presently
heard
the
music
of
a
pipe
now
very
mournful
and
sweet
anon
breaking
into
a
merry
lilt
full
of
rippling
trills
and
soft
bubbling
notes
most
pleasant
to
be
heard
wherefore
he
went
aside
and
thus
led
by
the
music
beheld
a
jester
in
his
motley
lying
beneath
a
tree
a
knave
was
he
pinched
and
something
doleful
of
visage
yet
with
quick
bright
eyes
that
laughed
sombre
brows
and
a
wide
mouth
upon
his
escalloped
cape
and
flaunting
were
many
little
bells
that
rang
a
silvery
chime
as
to
his
elbow
he
greeted
my
beltane
thus
hail
noble
youthful
sir
and
of
thy
sweet
and
gracious
courtesy
i
pray
you
mark
me
this
the
sun
is
hot
my
belly
lacketh
and
thou
art
a
fool
and
wherefore
questioned
beltane
leaning
him
upon
his
for
three
rarely
reasonable
reasons
sweet
sir
as
thus
item
for
that
the
sun
burneth
item
my
belly
is
empty
and
item
thou
lured
by
this
my
foolish
pipe
art
hither
come
to
folly
so
i
a
fool
do
greet
thee
fool
and
welcome
thee
to
this
my
palace
of
ease
and
pleasaunce
where
an
ye
be
minded
to
list
to
the
folly
of
a
rarely
foolish
fool
i
will
with
foolish
jape
and
quip
befool
thy
mind
to
mirth
and
jollity
for
thou
art
a
sad
fool
methinks
and
something
melancholic
quoth
beltane
sighing
is
a
sad
world
and
very
sorrowful
nay
is
a
sweet
world
and
very
joyful
for
such
as
have
eyes
to
see
withal
to
see
quoth
beltane
frowning
this
day
have
i
seen
a
dead
man
on
a
tree
a
babe
dead
beside
its
cradle
and
a
woman
die
upon
a
spear
all
day
have
i
breathed
an
air
befouled
by
nameless
evil
whithersoever
i
go
needs
must
i
walk
murder
and
shame
then
look
ever
before
thee
so
shalt
see
neither
yet
will
they
be
there
yet
doth
the
sun
shine
in
high
heaven
so
must
these
things
be
till
god
and
the
saints
shall
mend
them
but
if
thou
must
needs
be
doleful
go
make
thee
troubles
of
thine
own
but
leave
the
woes
of
this
wide
world
to
god
nay
said
beltane
shaking
his
head
how
if
god
leave
these
things
to
thee
and
me
why
then
methinks
the
world
must
wag
as
it
will
yet
must
we
repine
therefore
out
upon
thee
for
a
sober
doleful
wight
now
harkee
here
sit
i
less
fool
a
fool
who
hath
this
day
been
driven
forth
of
my
lord
presence
with
blows
and
cruel
stripes
and
wherefore
was
for
setting
a
bird
free
of
its
cage
a
small
matter
methinks
though
there
be
birds
and
birds
but
mum
for
that
yet
do
i
grieve
and
sigh
therefore
o
doleful
not
so
fie
o
i
blow
away
my
sorrows
through
the
music
of
this
my
little
pipe
and
lying
here
set
my
wits
and
lo
i
am
a
duke
a
king
a
very
god
i
create
me
a
world
wherein
is
neither
hunger
nor
stripes
a
world
of
joy
and
laughter
for
blessed
within
his
dreams
even
a
fool
may
walk
with
gods
and
juggle
with
the
stars
aye
nodded
beltane
but
how
when
he
awake
why
then
messire
laughed
the
fellow
leaping
nimbly
to
his
feet
why
then
doth
he
ask
alms
of
thee
as
thus
prithee
most
noble
messire
of
thy
bounty
show
kindness
to
a
fool
that
lacks
everything
but
wit
so
give
messire
give
and
spare
not
so
may
thy
lady
prove
kind
thy
wooing
prosper
and
love
strengthen
thee
now
when
the
jester
spake
of
love
my
beltane
must
needs
sigh
amain
and
shake
a
doleful
head
alas
said
he
within
my
life
shall
be
no
place
for
love
methinks
heigho
sighed
the
jester
thy
very
look
doth
proclaim
thee
lover
and
is
well
for
love
maketh
the
fool
wise
and
the
wise
fool
it
changeth
saints
into
rogues
and
rogues
into
saints
it
teacheth
the
strong
man
gentleness
and
maketh
the
gentle
strong
is
sweeter
than
honey
yet
bitter
as
gall
love
ah
love
can
drag
a
man
to
hell
or
lift
him
high
as
heaven
aye
verily
sighed
beltane
i
once
did
dream
of
such
a
love
but
now
am
i
awake
nor
will
i
dream
of
love
again
nor
rest
whiles
lust
and
cruelty
rule
this
sorrowful
duchy
ha
what
would
ye
then
fond
youth
i
am
come
to
smite
them
hence
said
beltane
clenching
mighty
fists
how
cried
the
jester
wide
of
eye
alone
nay
methinks
god
goeth
with
me
moreover
i
have
this
sword
and
speaking
beltane
touched
the
hilt
of
the
great
blade
at
his
side
what
a
sword
scoffed
the
jester
think
ye
to
mend
the
woes
of
thy
fellows
with
a
sword
go
to
thou
youthful
fool
i
tell
thee
is
only
humour
and
good
fellowship
can
mend
this
wretched
world
and
there
is
nought
so
lacking
in
humour
as
a
sword
unless
it
be
your
prating
priest
or
mumbling
monk
a
pope
in
cap
and
bells
now
aha
there
would
be
a
world
indeed
a
world
of
joy
and
laughter
no
more
gloom
no
more
bans
and
damnings
of
holy
church
no
more
groaning
and
snivelling
in
damp
cloister
and
mildewed
chapel
no
more
burnings
and
hangings
and
rackings
yet
said
beltane
shaking
his
head
yet
would
kings
and
dukes
remain
christian
knights
and
godly
lords
to
burn
and
hang
and
rack
the
defenceless
aye
sir
gravity
nodded
the
jester
but
the
church
is
paramount
ever
set
the
pope
of
tunes
upon
a
reed
and
kings
would
lay
by
their
sceptres
and
pipe
too
and
finding
no
time
or
lust
for
warring
so
strife
would
end
swords
rust
and
wit
grow
keen
and
wit
look
you
biteth
sharper
than
sword
laughter
is
more
enduring
than
blows
and
he
who
smiteth
smiteth
only
for
lack
of
wit
so
an
you
would
have
a
happy
world
lay
by
that
great
sword
and
betake
thee
to
a
little
pipe
teach
men
to
laugh
and
so
forget
their
woes
learn
wisdom
of
a
fool
as
thus
is
better
to
live
and
laugh
and
beget
thy
kind
than
to
perish
by
the
sword
or
to
dangle
from
a
tree
here
now
is
advice
and
in
this
advice
thy
life
thus
in
giving
thee
advice
so
do
i
give
thee
thy
life
and
i
am
hungry
and
in
thy
purse
is
money
wherewith
even
a
fool
might
come
by
food
and
youth
is
generous
and
thou
art
very
young
come
sweet
youthful
messire
how
much
for
thy
life
and
a
fool
advice
then
beltane
smiled
and
taking
out
one
of
his
three
remaining
gold
pieces
put
it
in
the
jester
hand
fare
thee
well
good
fool
said
he
i
leave
thee
to
thy
dreams
god
send
they
be
ever
fair
gold
cried
the
jester
spinning
the
coin
upon
his
thumb
ha
now
do
i
dream
indeed
may
thy
waking
be
ever
as
joyous
farewell
to
thee
thou
kind
sweet
youthful
fool
and
if
thou
must
hang
some
day
on
a
tree
may
every
leaf
voice
small
prayers
for
thy
gentle
soul
so
saying
the
jester
nodded
waved
aloft
his
bauble
and
skipped
away
among
the
trees
but
as
beltane
went
pondering
the
jester
saying
the
drowsy
stillness
was
shivered
by
a
sudden
loud
cry
followed
thereafter
by
a
clamour
of
fierce
shouting
therefore
beltane
paused
and
turning
beheld
the
jester
himself
who
ran
very
fleetly
yet
with
three
lusty
fellows
in
close
pursuit
messire
panted
the
jester
wild
of
eye
and
with
a
trickle
of
blood
upon
his
pallid
face
o
sweet
sir
let
them
not
slay
me
now
while
he
spake
and
being
yet
some
way
off
he
tripped
and
fell
and
as
he
lay
thus
the
foremost
of
his
pursuers
a
powerful
man
leapt
towards
him
whirling
up
his
to
smite
but
in
that
moment
beltane
leapt
also
and
took
the
blow
upon
his
staff
and
swung
it
aloft
yet
stayed
the
blow
and
bestriding
the
prostrate
jester
spake
soft
and
gentle
on
this
wise
greeting
to
thee
forest
fellow
thy
red
face
liketh
me
well
let
us
talk
together
but
hereupon
as
the
man
fell
back
staring
in
amaze
there
came
his
two
companions
albeit
panting
and
short
of
breath
what
roger
cried
one
doth
this
fellow
withstand
thee
but
roger
only
growled
whiles
beltane
smiled
upon
the
three
but
with
heavy
poised
lightly
in
practised
hand
quoth
he
how
now
would
ye
harm
the
fool
is
a
goodly
fool
forsooth
yet
with
legs
scarce
so
nimble
as
his
wit
and
a
tongue
ha
a
golden
tongue
to
win
all
men
to
humour
and
good
fellowship
enough
growled
roger
sir
pertolepe
foresters
we
be
give
us
yon
scurvy
fool
then
that
we
may
hang
him
out
of
hand
nay
answered
beltane
first
let
us
reason
together
let
us
hark
to
the
wisdom
of
folly
and
grow
wise
ha
roger
cried
one
of
the
men
tap
me
this
tall
rogue
on
his
golden
mazzard
or
said
beltane
the
fool
shall
charm
thy
souls
to
kindliness
with
his
pipe
ho
roger
cried
the
second
forester
split
me
this
tall
yellow
sconce
now
come
growled
roger
threatening
of
mien
yield
us
the
fool
is
an
arrant
knave
hath
angered
his
lord
what
matter
for
that
said
beltane
so
he
hath
not
angered
his
god
come
now
ye
be
hearty
fellows
and
have
faces
that
might
be
honest
tell
me
how
long
will
ye
serve
the
devil
devil
ha
what
talk
be
this
we
serve
no
devil
aye
nodded
beltane
though
they
call
him
pertolepe
the
red
hereabouts
devil
cried
black
roger
aghast
and
falling
back
a
step
he
gaped
in
amaze
from
beltane
to
his
gaping
fellows
devil
forsooth
he
gasped
aha
i
seen
many
a
man
hang
for
less
than
this
true
sighed
beltane
men
hang
for
small
matters
here
in
pentavalon
and
to
hang
is
an
evil
death
methinks
so
so
nodded
black
roger
i
watched
them
kick
a
fair
good
while
betimes
ah
cried
beltane
his
eyes
widening
those
hands
of
thine
belike
have
hanged
a
man
ere
this
aye
many
a
score
oho
folk
know
black
roger
name
hereabouts
i
carry
ever
a
noose
at
my
girdle
here
behold
it
and
he
showed
a
coil
of
rope
that
swung
at
his
belt
now
looking
from
the
man
grim
features
to
this
murderous
cord
beltane
blenched
and
shivered
whereat
black
roger
laughed
aloud
and
pointed
a
scornful
finger
is
fair
good
rope
this
and
and
shall
bear
even
thy
great
carcase
sweetly
aye
sweetly
how
hang
me
also
said
beltane
faintly
and
the
heavy
sagged
in
his
loosened
grip
hang
thee
aye
thou
didst
withstand
us
with
this
fool
thou
hast
dared
miscall
our
lord
we
be
all
witnesses
to
it
so
now
will
we
but
swift
as
beltane
long
whirled
and
fell
and
for
all
his
hood
of
mail
black
roger
threw
wide
his
arms
and
staggering
fell
upon
his
face
and
so
lay
then
fierce
and
grim
he
had
leapt
upon
the
other
two
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
rattle
and
thud
of
vicious
blows
but
these
foresters
were
right
lusty
fellows
and
they
together
beset
my
beltane
so
furiously
right
and
left
that
he
perforce
gave
back
their
swift
and
grievous
blows
and
being
overmatched
turned
and
betook
him
to
his
heels
whereat
they
incontinent
pursued
with
loud
gibes
and
fierce
laughter
but
on
ran
beltane
up
the
glade
very
fleetly
yet
watchful
of
eye
until
seeing
one
had
outstripped
his
fellow
he
checked
his
going
somewhat
stumbling
as
one
that
is
spent
whereat
the
forester
shouted
the
louder
and
came
on
amain
then
did
my
cunning
beltane
leap
aside
and
leaping
turned
and
smote
the
fellow
clean
and
true
upon
the
crown
and
laughing
to
see
him
fall
ran
in
upon
the
other
forester
with
whirling
now
this
fellow
seeing
himself
stand
alone
stayed
not
to
abide
the
onset
but
turning
about
made
off
into
the
green
then
beltane
leaned
him
panting
upon
his
staff
what
time
the
fallen
man
got
him
unsteadily
to
his
legs
and
limped
after
his
comrade
as
for
the
jester
he
was
gone
long
since
only
black
roger
lay
upon
his
face
and
groaned
faintly
ever
and
anon
wherefore
came
beltane
and
stood
above
him
as
one
in
thought
and
seeing
him
begin
to
stir
took
from
him
his
sword
and
coil
of
rope
and
loosing
off
his
swordbelt
therewith
bound
his
hands
fast
together
and
so
dragged
him
a
tree
that
stood
hard
by
thus
when
at
last
black
roger
opened
his
eyes
he
beheld
beltane
standing
above
him
and
in
his
hand
the
deadly
rope
now
looking
from
this
to
the
desolation
about
him
black
roger
shivered
and
gazing
up
into
the
stern
face
above
his
florid
cheek
grew
pale
master
said
he
hoarsely
what
would
ye
i
would
do
to
thee
as
thou
hast
done
to
others
hang
me
aye
quoth
beltane
and
setting
the
noose
about
his
neck
cast
the
rope
across
a
branch
master
how
shall
my
death
profit
thee
the
world
shall
be
the
better
and
thy
soul
know
less
of
sin
mayhap
master
said
black
roger
stooping
to
wipe
sweat
from
his
face
with
fettered
hands
i
have
store
of
money
set
by
but
beltane
laughed
with
pallid
lips
and
pulling
upon
the
rope
dragged
black
roger
choking
to
his
feet
master
he
gasped
show
a
little
mercy
hast
ever
shown
mercy
to
any
man
speak
me
true
alack
no
master
and
yet
how
then
shall
ye
expect
mercy
thou
hast
burnt
and
hanged
and
ravished
the
defenceless
so
now
shall
be
an
end
of
it
for
thee
yet
o
mark
me
this
thy
name
shall
live
on
accursed
in
memory
long
after
but
poor
dust
aye
there
be
many
alive
to
curse
black
roger
living
and
many
dead
to
curse
me
when
i
dead
poor
roger
soul
shall
find
small
mercy
hereafter
methinks
ha
i
never
thought
on
this
thou
a
mother
aye
but
they
burned
her
for
a
witch
when
i
was
but
a
lad
as
for
me
true
i
hanged
men
yet
i
was
my
lord
chief
verderer
and
did
but
as
my
lord
commanded
a
man
hath
choice
of
good
or
evil
aye
so
now
an
i
must
die
i
must
but
o
master
say
a
prayer
for
me
my
sins
lie
very
heavy
but
beltane
trembling
pulled
upon
the
rope
and
swung
black
roger
writhing
in
then
of
a
sudden
loosing
the
rope
the
forester
fell
and
while
he
lay
gasping
beltane
stooped
and
loosed
the
rope
from
his
neck
what
now
groaned
the
forester
sweet
jesu
ah
torture
me
not
take
back
thy
life
said
beltane
and
i
pray
god
that
henceforth
thou
shalt
make
of
it
better
use
and
live
to
aid
thy
fellows
so
shall
they
mayhap
some
day
come
to
bless
thy
memory
then
black
roger
coming
feebly
to
his
knees
looked
about
him
as
one
that
wakes
upon
a
new
world
and
lifted
wide
eyes
from
green
earth
to
cloudless
sky
to
live
quoth
he
to
live
and
so
with
sudden
gesture
stooped
his
head
to
hide
his
face
twitching
fingers
hereupon
beltane
smiled
yet
spake
not
and
turning
caught
up
his
staff
and
went
softly
upon
his
way
leaving
black
roger
the
forester
yet
upon
his
knees
chapter
x
how
beltane
made
comrade
one
black
roger
that
was
a
hangman
the
sun
was
low
what
time
beltane
came
to
a
shrine
that
stood
beside
the
way
where
was
a
grot
built
by
some
pious
soul
for
the
rest
and
refreshment
of
wearied
travellers
and
here
also
was
a
crystal
spring
the
which
bubbling
up
fell
with
a
musical
plash
into
the
basin
hollowed
within
the
rock
by
those
same
kindly
hands
here
beltane
stayed
and
when
he
had
drunk
his
fill
laid
him
down
in
the
grateful
shade
and
setting
his
cloak
beneath
his
head
despite
his
hunger
presently
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
the
sun
was
down
and
the
world
was
become
a
place
of
mystery
and
glooming
shadow
a
bird
called
plaintively
afar
off
in
the
dusk
the
spring
bubbled
softly
near
by
but
save
for
this
a
deep
silence
brooded
over
all
things
above
the
gloom
of
the
trees
the
sky
was
clear
where
bats
wheeled
and
hovered
and
beyond
the
purple
upland
an
orbed
moon
was
rising
now
as
beltane
breathed
the
cool
sweet
air
of
evening
and
looked
about
him
drowsily
he
suddenly
espied
a
shadow
within
the
shadows
a
dim
figure
yet
formidable
and
full
of
menace
and
he
started
up
weapon
in
fist
whereupon
the
threatening
figure
stirred
and
spake
master
is
i
said
a
voice
then
beltane
came
forth
of
the
grot
and
stared
upon
black
roger
o
hangman
said
he
where
is
thy
noose
but
roger
quailed
and
hung
his
head
and
spake
with
eyes
abased
master
i
burned
it
together
with
my
badge
of
service
and
what
would
ye
here
sir
i
am
a
masterless
man
henceforth

me
and
fear

have
cut

many
notches
and
every
notch

life

for
every
life
these
hands

taken

i
vow
to
save

it
may
be
so
and
for

a
notch
until
my
belt

smooth
again
and
my
soul

lighter
why

ye
to
me
black
roger
for
that
this
day
at
dire
peril
i
saw

fool

to
thee

dangerous

wrongs

ha
belike

some
vow

many
and
strong
yet
because

adventure
thus
he
that
companies

must
go
ever
by
desperate
ways
and
is
like
enough
death
shall
meet
him
in
the
road
master
quoth
black
roger
this
day
have
ye
shown
me
death
yet
given
me
new
life
so
beseech
thee
let
me
serve
thee
henceforth
and
aid
thee
in
this
thy
vow
now
hereupon
beltane
smiled
and
reached
forth
his
hand
then
black
roger
falling
upon
his
knee
touched
the
hand
to
lip
and
forehead
and
heart
taking
him
for
his
lord
henceforth
and
spake
the
oath
of
fealty
but
when
he
would
have
risen
beltane
stayed
him
what
black
roger
thou
hast
sworn
fealty
and
obedience
to
me
now
swear
me
this
to
god
to
hold
ever
and
abide
by
thy
word
to
shew
mercy
to
the
distressed
and
to
shield
the
helpless
at
all
times
and
when
he
had
sworn
black
roger
rose
and
eager
lord
said
he
whither
do
we
go
now
quoth
beltane
shew
me
where
i
may
eat
for
i
have
a
mighty
hunger
forsooth
quoth
roger
scratching
his
chin
shallowford
village
lieth
but
a
bowshot
through
the
brush
yonder
yet
forsooth
a
man
shall
eat
little
there
methinks
these
days
why
so
for
that
was
burned
down
scarce
a
week
agone
burned
and
wherefore
lord
pertolepe
fell
out
with
his
neighbour
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
upon
the
matter
of
some
wench
methinks
it
was
wherefore
came
sir
gilles
men
by
night
and
burned
down
shallowford
with
twenty
hunting
dogs
of
sir
pertolepe
that
chanced
to
be
there
whereupon
my
lord
waxed
mighty
wroth
and
gathering
his
company
came
into
the
demesne
of
sir
gilles
and
burned
down
divers
manors
and
hung
certain
rogues
and
destroyed
two
villages
in
quittance
ah
and
what
of
the
village
folk
my
lord
they
were
but
serfs
for
the
most
part
but
for
sir
pertolepe
dogs
twenty
and
two
and
roasted
alive
poor
beasts
but
here
black
roger
checked
both
speech
and
stride
all
at
once
and
stood
with
poised
as
from
the
depth
of
the
wood
came
the
sound
of
voices
and
fierce
laughter
come
away
master
he
whispered
these
should
be
sir
men
methinks
but
beltane
shook
his
head
i
fain
to
see
why
they
laugh
said
he
and
speaking
stole
forward
amid
the
shadows
and
so
presently
parting
the
leaves
looked
down
into
an
open
dell
or
dingle
full
of
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
light
that
glinted
upon
the
steel
caps
and
hauberks
of
some
score
men
who
leaned
upon
pike
or
gisarm
about
one
who
sat
upon
a
fallen
tree
and
beltane
saw
that
this
was
giles
the
bowman
but
the
arms
of
giles
were
bound
behind
his
back
about
his
neck
hung
a
noose
and
his
face
showed
white
and
pallid
the
moon
as
lifting
up
his
head
he
began
to
sing
o
shall
my
lust
for
the
bowl
decline
nor
my
love
for
my
good
long
bow
for
as
bow
to
the
shaft
and
as
bowl
to
the
wine
is
a
the
rich
voice
was
strangled
to
a
gasping
sob
as
the
rope
was
tightened
suddenly
about
the
singer
brawny
throat
and
he
was
swung
kicking
into
the
air
amid
the
hoarse
gibes
and
laughter
of
the
but
grim
and
silent
beltane
leaped
down
among
them
his
long
blade
glittering
in
the
moonlight
and
before
the
mighty
sweep
of
it
they
fell
back
crowding
upon
each
other
and
confused
then
beltane
turning
cut
asunder
the
cord
and
giles
brabblecombe
fell
and
lay
the
shade
of
the
tree
wheezing
and
whimpering
in
the
grass
and
now
with
a
clamour
of
cries
and
fierce
rallying
shouts
the
seeing
beltane
stand
alone
set
themselves
in
array
and
began
to
close
in
upon
him
but
beltane
facing
them
in
the
tender
moonlight
set
the
point
of
his
sword
to
earth
and
reached
out
his
mailed
hand
in
salutation
greeting
brothers
said
he
why
seek
ye
the
death
of
this
our
brother
come
now
suffer
him
to
go
his
ways
in
peace
and
blessing
on
ye
one
and
all
now
at
this
some
laughed
and
some
growled
and
one
stood
forth
before
his
fellows
staring
upon
beltane
grizzled
brows
is
a
rogue
and
shall
dance
for
us
upon
a
string
laughed
he
and
this
tall
fellow
with
him
said
another
aye
aye
let
us
hang
together
cried
others
stay
said
beltane
behold
here
money
so
now
will
i
ransom
this
man
life
of
ye
here
be
two
pieces
of
gold
is
my
all
yet
take
them
and
yield
me
his
life
hereupon
the
men
fell
to
muttering
together
doubtfully
but
in
this
moment
the
grizzled
man
of
a
sudden
raised
a
knotted
fist
and
shook
it
in
the
air
ha
cried
he
pointing
to
beltane
look
ye
cuthbert
rollo
see
ye
not
is
him
we
seek
mark
ye
the
size
of
him
his
long
sword
and
belt
of
silver
is
he
that
came
upon
us
in
the
green
this
day
and
slew
our
comrade
michael
come
now
let
us
hang
him
forthwith
and
share
his
money
betwixt
us
after
then
my
beltane
sighed
amain
and
sighing
unsheathed
his
dagger
alas
said
he
and
must
we
shed
each
other
blood
forsooth
come
then
let
us
slay
each
other
and
may
christ
have
pity
on
our
souls
thus
saying
he
glanced
up
at
the
pale
splendour
of
the
moon
and
round
him
on
the
encircling
shadows
of
the
woods
dense
and
black
beneath
the
myriad
leaves
and
so
and
poised
for
action
waited
for
the
rush
and
even
as
they
came
upon
him
he
sprang
aside
where
the
gloom
lay
blackest
and
they
being
many
and
the
clearing
small
they
hampered
each
other
and
fell
into
confusion
and
in
that
moment
beltane
leapt
among
them
and
smote
and
smote
again
now
in
the
moonlight
now
in
shadow
leaping
from
the
thrust
of
sword
and
pike
crouching
the
heavy
swing
of
axe
and
gisarm
and
ever
his
terrible
blade
darted
with
deadly
point
or
fell
with
edge
hands
gripped
at
him
from
the
gloom
arms
strove
to
clasp
him
but
his
was
swift
and
strong
pike
heads
leapt
at
him
and
were
smitten
away
axe
and
gisarm
struck
yet
found
him
not
and
ever
as
he
leapt
he
smote
and
now
in
his
ears
were
cries
and
groans
and
other
hateful
sounds
and
to
his
nostrils
came
a
reek
of
sweating
flesh
and
the
scent
of
trampled
grass
while
the
moon
tender
light
showed
faces
wild
and
fierce
that
came
and
went
now
here
now
there
it
glinted
on
and
ringed
mail
and
flashed
back
from
whirling
steel
a
round
placid
moon
that
seemed
all
at
once
to
burst
asunder
and
vanish
smitten
into
nothingness
he
was
down
beaten
to
his
knee
deafened
and
half
blind
but
struggling
to
his
feet
he
staggered
out
from
the
friendly
shadow
of
the
trees
out
into
the
open
a
sword
bent
and
snapped
short
upon
his
triple
mail
the
blow
of
a
gisarm
half
stunned
him
a
goring
drove
him
reeling
back
yet
ringed
in
by
death
he
thrust
and
smote
with
failing
arm
axe
and
pike
sword
and
gisarm
hedged
him
in
nearer
and
nearer
his
sword
grew
suddenly
heavy
and
beyond
his
strength
to
wield
but
stumbling
slipping
dazed
and
with
eyes
he
raised
the
great
blade
aloft
and
lifting
drooping
head
cried
aloud
the
of
his
house
high
and
clear
it
rang
above
the
din
arise
arise
i
will
arise
and
even
in
that
moment
came
one
in
answer
to
the
cry
one
that
leapt
to
his
right
hand
a
wild
man
and
hairy
who
plied
a
gleaming
axe
and
each
stroke
seemed
from
hairy
throat
to
echo
back
the
cry
arise
arise
and
now
upon
his
left
was
black
roger
behind
his
buckler
thereafter
a
voice
hailed
them
as
from
far
away
a
sweet
deep
voice
cheery
and
familiar
as
one
heard
aforetime
in
a
dream
and
betwixt
every
sentence
came
the
twang
of
o
tall
brother
fall
back
o
gentle
paladin
o
fair
flower
of
lusty
fighters
fall
back
and
leave
the
rest
to
our
comrades
to
me
and
my
good
bow
here
so
dazed
and
breathless
came
beltane
on
stumbling
feet
and
leaned
him
gasping
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
tree
whereby
stood
giles
o
the
bow
with
arrows
planted
upright
in
the
sod
before
him
the
which
he
snatched
and
loosed
so
fast
was
a
wonder
to
behold
of
a
sudden
he
uttered
a
shout
and
setting
by
his
bow
drew
sword
and
leaping
from
the
shadow
was
gone
but
as
for
beltane
he
leaned
a
while
against
the
tree
as
one
who
is
very
faint
yet
soon
lifting
heavy
head
wondered
at
the
hush
of
all
things
and
looking
toward
the
clearing
saw
it
empty
and
himself
alone
therefore
turned
he
thitherwards
now
as
he
went
he
stumbled
and
his
foot
struck
a
something
soft
and
yielding
that
rolled
before
him
in
the
shadow
out
out
into
the
full
brilliance
of
the
moon
and
looking
down
he
beheld
a
mangled
head
that
stared
up
at
him
and
with
mouth
agape
then
beltane
let
fall
his
reeking
sword
and
staggering
out
into
the
light
saw
his
bright
mail
befouled
with
clotted
blood
and
of
a
sudden
the
world
went
black
about
him
and
he
fell
and
lay
with
his
face
among
the
trampled
grass
in
a
while
he
groaned
and
opened
his
eyes
to
find
black
roger
bathing
his
face
what
time
giles
o
the
bow
held
wine
to
his
lips
while
at
his
feet
a
wild
figure
grim
and
ragged
stood
a
tall
hairy
man
leaning
upon
a
axe
aha
cried
the
bowman
come
now
my
lovely
fighter
my
gentle
giant
sup
this
is
life
and
here
behold
a
venison
steak
fit
for
duke
self
come
nay
first
says
beltane
sitting
up
are
there
many
hurt
aye
never
fear
for
that
my
dove
they
be
all
most
completely
dead
save
one
and
he
sore
wounded
deo
amen

cried
beltane
shivering
dead
say
you
aye
sir
paladin
all
sweetly
asleep
in
abraham
bosom
we
three
here
accounted
for
some
few
betwixt
us
the
rest
fell
that
great
blade
o
thine
o
sweet
saint
giles
saw
i
such
point
and
edge
and
i
called
thee
dove
aye
it
was
i
mind
me
o
blind
and
worse
than
blind
but
tall
brother
now
hereupon
beltane
bowed
his
head
and
clasping
his
hands
wrung
them
sweet
jesu
forgive
me
he
cried
i
had
not
meant
to
slay
so
many
then
he
arose
and
went
apart
and
kneeling
among
the
shadows
prayed
long
and
fervently
chapter
xi
which
tells
how
three
mighty
men
sware
fealty
to
beltane
and
how
good
friar
martin
digged
a
grave
in
the
wild
now
when
beltane
mighty
hunger
was
assuaged
he
sat
his
aching
head
yet
ringing
with
the
blow
and
stared
up
at
the
moon
sad
and
as
one
full
of
heaviness
the
while
black
roger
standing
beside
him
gazed
askance
at
the
archer
who
sat
near
by
whistling
softly
and
busied
with
certain
arrows
cleaning
and
trimming
them
ere
he
set
them
back
in
his
quiver
and
presently
black
roger
spake
softly
to
beltane
ear
lord
we
have
saved
the
life
of
yon
prating
and
behold
my
belt
lacketh
for
one
notch
which
is
well
so
come
let
us
go
our
ways
thou
and
i
for
i
love
not
your
talkers
and
this
fellow
hath
overmuch
to
say
but
now
ere
beltane
could
make
reply
came
the
hairy
man
but
behold
his
rags
had
given
place
to
fair
garments
of
tanned
leather
albeit
something
small
together
with
steel
cap
and
shirt
of
ringed
mail
and
about
his
middle
a
broad
belt
where
swung
a
heavy
sword
being
come
to
beltane
he
paused
leaning
upon
his
axe
and
gazed
upon
him
messire
said
he
who
ye
are
i
know
not
what
ye
are
i
care
not
for
art
quick
of
foot
and

of

when
ye
fight

a
point
of
war
a
i
knew
aforetime
ere
they
enslaved
and
made
of
me
a
serf
and
thus
it
is
i
would
follow
thee
quoth
beltane
his
aching
head
upon
his
hand
whither
to
death
if
needs
be
for
a
man
must
die
soon
or
late
yet
die
but
once
whether
it
be
by
the
steel
or
flame
or
rope
so
what
matter

way
of
it
if
i
may
stand
with
this
my
axe

to
face
with
gilles
of
brandonmere

hangman
and

growled
roger
oho
laughed
giles
with
a
flash
of
white
teeth
a
hangman
and
a
serf
must
i
slay
both
but
ere
he
could
draw
sword
came
a
voice
from
the
shadows
near
by
a
deep
voice
clear
and
very
sweet
oh
children
said
the
voice
oh
children
of
god
put
up
your
steel
and
pray
for
one
whose
white
soul
doth
mount
now
to
heaven
and
forth
into
the
light
came
one
clad
as
a
white
friar
a
tall
man
and
slender
and
upon
his
shoulder
he
bare
a
mattock
that
gleamed
beneath
the
moon
his
coarse
white
robe
frayed
and
worn
was
stained
with
earth
and
the
green
of
grass
and
was
splashed
here
and
there
with
a
darker
stain
pale
was
he
and
but
with
eyes
that
gleamed
black
brows
and
with
chin
long
and
purposeful
now
at
sight
of
him
walkyn
cried
aloud
and
flung
aside
his
axe
and
falling
on
his
knees
caught
the
friar
threadbare
robe
and
kissed
it
good
brother
he
groaned
o
gentle
brother
martin
pity
me
what
walkyn
quoth
the
friar
what
do
ye
thus
equipped
and
so
far
from
home
home
have
i
none
henceforth
o
my
father
ah
what
then
of
thy
wife
truda
of
thy
little
son
dead
my
father
red
pertolepe
men
slew
them
this
day
within
the
green
so
when
i
had
buried
them
i
took
my
axe
and
left
them
with
god
yet
shall
my
soul
go
lonely
methinks
until
my
time
be
come
then
friar
martin
reached
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
upon
walkyn
bowed
head
and
though
the
hand
was
hard
and
the
touch
of
it
was
ineffably
gentle
and
he
spake
with
eyes
upraised
to
heaven
o
christ
of
pity
look
down
upon
this
stricken
soul
be
thou
his
stay
and
comfort
teach
him
in
his
grief
and
sorrow
to
pity
the
woes
of
others
that
in
comforting
his
fellows
he
may
himself
find
comfort
now
when
the
prayer
was
ended
he
turned
and
looked
upon
the
others
and
beholding
beltane
in
his
might
and
glittering
mail
he
spake
saluting
him
as
one
of
rank
sir
knight
said
he
do
these
men
follow
thee
aye
verily
cried
the
archer
that
do
i
in
sooth
sat
good
friar
not
so
growled
roger
is
but
a
pestilent
archer
that
seeketh
but
base
hire
i
only
am
my
lord
man
sworn
to
aid
him
in
his
vow
i
also
quoth
walkyn
an
so
my
lord
wills
so
shall
it
be
sighed
beltane
his
hand
upon
his
throbbing
brow
and
what
have
ye
in
mind
to
do
forsooth
cried
giles
to
fight
good
friar
to
obey
my
lord
said
roger
and
speak
good
saxon
english
to
adventure
my
body
in
battle
with
joyful
heart
quoth
walkyn
to
make
an
end
of
tyranny
sighed
beltane
alas
said
the
friar
within
this
doleful
duchy
be
tyrants
a
many
and
ye
are
but
four
meseemeth
yet
if
within
your
hearts
be
room
for
pity
follow
me
and
i
will
show
you
a
sight
mayhap
shall
nerve
you
strong
as
giants
come
so
beltane
followed
the
white
friar
with
the
three
upon
his
heels
who
wrangled
now
no
more
and
in
a
while
the
friar
paused
beside
a
grave
behold
said
he
the
bed
where
we
each
one
must
sleep
some
day
and
yet
is
cold
and
hard
methinks
for
one
so
young
and
tender
so
saying
he
sighed
and
turning
brought
them
to
a
hut
near
by
an
humble
dwelling
of
mud
and
wattles
by
a
glimmering
rush
but
being
come
within
the
hut
beltane
stayed
of
a
sudden
and
held
his
breath
staring
at
that
which
lay
so
still
then
baring
his
head
sank
upon
his
knees
she
lay
outstretched
upon
a
bed
of
fern
and
looked
as
one
that
sleeps
save
for
the
deathly
pallor
of
her
cheek
and
still
and
pulseless
bosom
and
she
was
young
and
of
a
wondrous
gentle
beauty
behold
said
the
friar
but
one
short
hour
agone
this
was
alive
a
child
of
god
pure
of
heart
and
undefiled
these
gentle
hands
lie
stilled
forever
this
sweet
white
body
o
shame
of
men
blasted
by
brutality
maimed
and
torn
is
nought
but
piteous
clay
to
moulder
in
the
year
yet
doth
her
radiant
soul
lie
on
the
breast
of
god
forever
since
she
for
honour
died
the
death
behold
so
saying
the
friar
with
sudden
hand
laid
bare
the
still
and
marble
bosom
and
beholding
the
red
horror
wrought
there
by
cruel
steel
beltane
rose
up
and
taking
off
his
cloak
therewith
reverently
covered
the
pale
dead
beauty
of
her
and
so
stood
awhile
with
eyes
close
shut
and
spake
and
slow
pallid
lips
how
came
this
thing
she
was
captive
to
sir
pertolepe
by
him
taken
in
a
raid
and
he
would
have
had
her
to
his
will
yet
by
aid
of
my
lord
jester
she
escaped
and
fled
hither
but
sir
pertolepe
foresters
pursued
and
took
her
and
so
is
she
dead
may
god
requite
them
amen
quoth
giles
o
the
bow
so
do
they
all
lie
dead
within
the
green
save
one
said
roger
but
he
sore
wounded
quoth
walkyn
how
cried
the
friar
aghast
have
ye
indeed
slain
sir
foresters
nineteen
nodded
roger
grimly
alas
cried
the
friar
may
god
save
the
poor
folk
hereabouts
for
now
will
sir
pertolepe
wreak
vengeance
dire
upon
them
then
said
beltane
then
must
i
have
word
with
sir
pertolepe
now
when
he
said
this
black
roger
stared
agape
and
even
the
tongue
failed
him
for
once
but
walkyn
smiled
and
gripped
his
axe
art
mad
tall
brother
cried
giles
at
length
sir
pertolepe
would
hang
thee
out
of
hand
or
throw
thee
to
his
dogs
lord
said
roger
sir
pertolepe
hath
ten
score
in
garthlaxton
beside
bowmen
and
foresters
there
should
be
good
work
for
mine
axe
smiled
walkyn
none
the
less
must
i
speak
with
him
said
beltane
and
turned
him
to
the
door
then
will
i
die
with
thee
lord
growled
roger
so
will
i
come
and
watch
thee
die
hangman
and
loose
a
shaft
or
two
on
mine
own
account
but
now
of
a
sudden
walkyn
raised
a
warning
hand
hark
said
he
and
in
a
while
as
they
listened
upon
the
stillness
came
a
rustle
of
leaves
and
thereafter
a
creeping
step
drawing
slowly
nearer
then
swift
and
walkyn
stole
out
into
the
shadows
very
soon
he
returned
leading
a
woman
pale
and
haggard
who
clasped
a
babe
within
her
threadbare
cloak
her
eyes
were
red
and
sore
with
much
weeping
and
upon
the
threshold
she
paused
as
one
in
sudden
fear
but
espying
the
friar
she
uttered
a
cry
o
father
martin
good
father
pray
pray
for
the
soul
of
him
who
is
father
to
my
child
but
who
at
dawn
must
die
with
many
others
upon
my
lord
duke
great
gallows
alas
cried
the
friar
wringing
his
hands
what
news
is
this
o
good
friar
sobbed
the
woman
my
lord
hand
hath
been
so
heavy
upon
us
of
late
so
heavy
and
there
came
messengers
from
thrasfordham
in
bourne
bidding
us
thither
with
fair
promises
and
my
father
being
head
of
our
village
hearkened
to
them
and
we
made
ready
to
cross
into
bourne
but
my
lord
came
upon
us
and
burned
our
village
of
shallowford
and
lashed
my
father
with
whips
and
thereafter
hanged
him
and
took
my
man
and
many
others
and
cast
them
into
the
great
dungeon
at
belsaye
and
with
the
dawn
they
must
hang
upon
the
duke
great
gallows
so
she
ended
and
stood
weeping
as
one
that
is
hopeless
and
weary
but
of
a
sudden
she
screamed
and
pointed
at
black
roger
with
her
finger
is
roger
she
cried
is
black
roger
that
slew
my
father
then
roger
the
black
groaned
and
hid
his
face
within
his
arm
and
shrank
before
the
woman
outstretched
finger
and
groaning
cowered
to
his
knees
whereupon
the
archer
turned
his
back
and
spat
upon
the
floor
while
walkyn
glared
and
fingered
his
great
axe
but
in
this
moment
my
beltane
came
beside
him
and
laid
his
hand
on
roger
stooping
shoulder
nay
said
he
this
is
my
friend
henceforth
a
man
among
men
who
liveth
to
do
great
things
as
thus
he
will
give
back
to
thee
the
father
of
thy
child
and
break
open
the
dungeon
of
belsaye
thus
spake
my
beltane
while
all
stared
at
his
saying
and
held
their
peace
because
of
their
amaze
only
black
roger
turned
of
a
sudden
and
caught
his
hand
and
kissed
it
savagely
sir
said
the
woman
peering
up
in
beltane
face
lord
ah
would
ye
mock
the
weak
and
helpless
nay
said
beltane
gently
as
god
seeth
me
the
prisoners
shall
go
free
or
this
man
and
i
die
with
them
so
now
be
comforted
go
you
to
bourne
to
sir
benedict
within
thrasfordham
keep
and
say
you
come
from
beltane
duke
of
pentavalon
who
swore
thee
by
the
honour
of
the
duke
beltane
his
father
that
never
again
shall
a
man
hang
from
the
great
gallows
of
black
ivo
the
usurper
from
this
night
it
shall
cease
to
be
now
would
the
woman
have
knelt
and
kissed
his
hand
but
beltane
smiled
and
brought
her
to
the
door
then
wondering
and
amazed
she
made
her
obeisance
to
beltane
and
with
her
babe
clasped
to
her
bosom
went
forth
into
the
night
thereafter
beltane
turned
and
looked
upon
the
three
my
masters
quoth
he
ye
have
heard
my
words
how
this
night
i
go
to
take
down
black
ivo

or

cried
the
three
in
one
acclaim
do
ye
then
stand
with
me
henceforth
black
ivo
and
all
his
might
aye
or
no
aye
lord
cried
they
again
then
beltane
smiled
and
drew
his
sword
and
came
to
them
the
great
blade
gleaming
in
his
hand
is
well
said
he
but
first
come
now
and
lay
your
hands
here
upon
my
sword
and
swear
me
this
each
one
to
follow
ever
where
i
shall
lead
to
abide
henceforth
in
brotherhood
together
to
smite
evil
within
you
and
without
to
be
pitiful
to
the
weak
and
to
honour
god
at
all
times
then
did
the
three
being
upon
their
knees
lay
their
hands
upon
the
sword
and
swear
the
oath
as
beltane
commanded
now
came
the
white
friar
and
stared
upon
the
sword
and
beholding
the
motto
graven
in
the
steel
lifted
up
his
hand
to
heaven
and
cried
aloud
now
greeting
and
fair
greeting
to
thee
lord
duke
may
thy
body
be
strong
for
war
and
thy
head
wise
in
the
council
for
pentavalon
hath
dire
need
of
thee
beltane
son
of
duke
beltane
the
strong
moreover
i
was
sent
to
thee
by
sir
benedict
of
bourne
who
bids
thee
and

for
that
the
time
is
at
hand
how
cried
beltane
art

hundred
chosen
and
within

mayhap
a
thousand
more
it
is
become
a
haven
for
those
that
flee
from
tyranny
and
bitter
wrong
as
for
me
i
journey
where
i
will
within
the
duchy
serving
the
poor
and
ministering
to
the
and
everywhere
is
black
sin
and
suffering
and
death
so
now
in
the
name
of

thy
sorrowful
duchy
and
may

beltane
duke

i
in
blood
and
duke
will
i
yet
be
in
very
sooth
an
god
so
will
it
then
turning
to
the
three
who
stood
hearkening
and
wide
of
eye
he
smiled
and
reached
to
them
his
hand
good
friends
said
he
knowing
nought
of
me
yet
were
ye
willing
to
follow
my
fortunes
for
this
do
i
thank

one
and
all
and

or
low
be
thine
henceforth
is
ivo
duke
and
i
thy
no
more
no
less
this
i
pray
you
all
remember
so
saying
beltane
sheathed
his
sword
and
beholding
friar
martin
on
his
knees
beside
that
muffled
figure
he
knelt
also
and
the
three
with
him
thereafter
at
a
sign
from
the
friar
beltane
stooped
and
raised
this
slender
shrouded
figure
in
his
arms
and
reverently
bore
it
out
into
the
shadows
and
there
all
in
the
tender
radiance
of
the
moon
they
buried
her
whose
name
they
never
knew
and
stood
a
while
in
silence
then
pointing
to
the
earth
friar
martin
spake
lo
here
in
but
a
little
time
wild
flowers
shall
bloom
above
her
yet
none
purer
or
sweeter
than
she
in
a
little
shall
the
grass
be
green
again
and
she
sleep
here
forgot
by
all
save
god
and
god
my
brothers
is
a
gentle
god
and
very
pitiful
so
now
do
we
leave
her
in
god
abiding
care
and
presently
they
turned
and
went
upon
their
way
leaving
the
place
to
solitude
but
from
the
vault
of
heaven
the
stars
looked
down
upon
that
lonely
grave
like
the
watching
eyes
of
holy
angels
chapter
xii
which
tells
how
duke
ivo
great
gallows
ceased
to
be
scarce
a
mile
without
the
walls
of
the
fair
city
of
belsaye
my
lord
duke
had
builded
him
a
great
gallows
had
set
it
high
upon
a
hill
for
all
the
world
to
see
from
whose
lofty
five
score
rogues
had
hanged
ere
now
had
writhed
and
kicked
their
lives
away
and
rotted
there
in
company
that
all
the
world
might
know
how
potent
was
the
anger
of
my
lord
duke
ivo
day
in
day
out
from
rosy
morn
till
dewy
eve
it
frowned
upon
belsaye
a
thing
of
doom
whose
grim
sight
should
warn
rebellious
townsfolk
to
dutiful
submission
by
night
it
loomed
a
brooding
horror
whose
loathsome
reek
should
mind
them
how
all
rogues
must
end
that
dared
lift
hand
or
voice
against
my
lord
duke
or
those
proud
barons
lords
and
knights
who
by
his
pleasure
held
their
fiefs
with
rights
of
justice
the
high
the
middle
and
the
low
day
in
day
out
the
men
of
belsaye
eyed
it
askance
scowling
brows
and
by
night
many
a
clenched
hand
was
shaken
and
many
a
whispered
malediction
sped
toward
that
thing
of
doom
that
menaced
them
from
the
dark
the
moon
was
full
and
thus
following
friar
martin
bony
outstretched
finger
beltane
of
a
sudden
espied
afar
the
duke
great
gallows
rising
grisly
and
stark
against
the
moon
round
splendour
so
for
a
space
standing
yet
within
the
shade
of
the
woods
beltane
stared
the
while
giles
with
roger
at
his
elbow
pointed
out
divers
shapes
that
dangled
high
in
air
at
sight
of
which
the
friar
knelt
with
bowed
head
and
lips
that
moved
in
prayer
and
walkyn
scowling
muttered
in
his
beard
messire
said
the
archer
my
lord
duke
gallows
is
great
and
very
strong
and
we
but
five
all
told
i
have
mine
axe
quoth
walkyn
had
we
fifty
axes
we
scarce
should
bring
it
down
ere
dawn
moreover
the
night
is
very
still
and
sounds
carry
far
nathless
quoth
roger
we
surely
shall
destroy
it
my
lord
hath
said
so
aye
but
how
questioned
giles
in
belsaye
is
that
pale
fox
sir
gui
of
allerdale
with
many
trusty
to
hold
the
town
for
black
ivo
and
teach
belsaye
its
duty
how
may
we
destroy
my
lord
gallows
the
very
beards
of
my
lord
duke
garrison
wilt
tell
me
that
my
good
black
rogerkin
aye
nodded
roger
that
will
i
when
i
have
asked
my
lord
so
saying
he
came
and
touched
beltane
and
humbly
put
the
question
then
with
his
gaze
yet
upon
the
gallows
beltane
sighed
and
answered
there
hath
been
no
rain
for
weeks
look
you
the
underbrush
is
dry
methinks
and
should
burn
well
aye
for
sure
said
roger
we
shall
burn
black
ivo
gallows
to
ashes
bowman
and
a
good
end
be
by
fire
cried
the
archer
aghast
but
lord
so
soon
as
they
shall
see
the
flames
sir
gui
and
his
men
will
sally
out
upon
us
nay
said
beltane
for
we
shall
sally
in
into
belsaye
mean
you
lord
certes
answered
beltane
how
else
may
we
break
open
the
dungeon
the
night
is
young
yet
but
we
have
much
to
do
follow
so
saying
beltane
turned
and
keeping
ever
within
the
shadow
of
the
trees
set
off
towards
that
distant
hill
where
stood
the
gallows
black
against
the
moon
swiftly
they
went
and
for
the
most
part
in
silence
for
beltane
mind
was
busied
upon
many
matters
so
betimes
they
climbed
the
hill
and
stood
at
last
beneath
the
gallows
and
glancing
up
beltane
beheld
noisome
shapes
black
and
shrivelled
that
once
had
lived
and
laughed
forthwith
he
drew
his
sword
and
fell
to
cutting
down
the
brush
whereat
friar
martin
girding
up
his
frock
took
walkyn
sword
and
fell
to
likewise
now
as
beltane
laboured
thus
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
wild
and
ragged
figure
the
which
started
up
before
him
as
if
from
the
very
ground
an
old
man
he
was
bent
with
years
yet
with
eyes
that
burned
fierce
and
undimmed
hoary
brows
and
shrivelled
hands
that
gripped
upon
a
rusty
sword
who
are
ye
he
cried
who
are
ye
that
disturb
this
woeful
place
is
here
that
men
are
dragged
to
die
and
being
dead
do
hang
i
the
air
to
rot
and
rot
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
of
wolves
that
howl
and
birds
that
shriek
aha
carrion
crows
and
kites
they
be
well
gorged
since
ivo
came
they
cry
soft
child
flesh
and
the
flesh
of
tender
maids
aha
i
know
watched
i
seen
ah
since
my
lord
duke
beltane
died
what
sights
these
eyes
have
seen
old
man
quoth
beltane
bending
near
who
art
thou
i
am
the
ghost
that
haunts
this
place
but
ages
since
i
was
sir
robert
bellesme
of
garthlaxton
keep
but
my
wife
they
slew
my
daughter
ravished
from
me
and
my
son
ah
christ
my
son
they
hanged
him
here
yonder
he
hung
and
i
his
father
watched
him
die
but
by
night
when
all
was
still
i
crept
hither
and
found
a
hole
to
shelter
me
and
here
i
stayed
to
watch
over
him
my
son
who
hung
so
quiet
and
so
still
and
the
rough
wind
buffeted
him
the
cruel
rain
lashed
him
and
the
hot
sun
scorched
him
but
still
he
hung
there
so
high
so
high
yet
i
waited
for
the
strongest
rope
will
break
in
time
and
upon
a
moony
night
he
fell
and
i
gathered
him
in
my
arms
close
here
against
my
heart
and
buried
him
where
none
can
know
save
god
many
others
have
i
buried
also
for
the
strongest
cords
must
break
in
time
and
folk
do
say
the
devil
bears
them
hence
since
none
are
ever
found
but
i
know
where
they
lie
six
hundred
and
seventy
and
nine
i
know
these
hands
have
buried
them
and
i
have
kept
a
tally
ah
but
you
gentle
youth
what
would
ye
here
burn
down
the
gallows
said
beltane
is
an
accursed
thing
so
shall
it
shame
earth
and
heaven
no
longer
how
how
cried
the
ancient
man
letting
fall
his
rusty
sword
destroy
black
ivo
gibbet
dare
ye
dare
ye
such
a
thing
indeed
are
there
men
with
souls
unconquered
yet
methought
all
such
were
old
or
dead
or
fled
away
dare
ye
this
youth
aye
nodded
beltane
watch
now
and
hereupon
he
together
with
the
others
fell
to
hewing
down
the
dry
brush
with
might
and
main
and
piling
it
about
the
gibbet
massy
beams
while
the
ancient
man
perched
upon
a
rock
hard
by
watched
them
his
shaggy
brows
and
laughed
soft
and
shrill
aha
he
cried
the
fire
ye
kindle
here
shall
set
the
duchy
in
a
flame
mayhap
to
burn
black
ivo
with
gui
of
allerdale
and
red
pertolepe
mayhap
for
them
fire
on
earth
and
flame
in
hell
aha
to
burn
the
gibbet
is
well
bethought
so
shall
carrion
kite
and
jay
go
hereabouts
mayhap
oho
they
shall
cry
give
us
to
eat
fair
white
flesh
yet
how
may
they
eat
when
the
gallows
is
no
more
thus
spake
he
with
shrill
laughter
while
beltane
laboured
until
the
sweat
ran
from
him
while
walkyn
great
axe
flashed
and
fell
near
by
and
steel
glittered
among
the
underbrush
that
clothed
the
slopes
of
the
hill
very
soon
they
had
stacked
great
piles
of
kindling
about
the
timbers
twigs
below
faggots
above
cunningly
ordered
and
higher
than
beltane
head
now
as
beltane
leaned
upon
his
sword
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
eyes
came
roger
and
walkyn
yet
panting
from
their
labour
master
said
roger
they
should
burn
well
i
trow
and
yet
and
yet
quoth
walkyn
these
beams
be
thick
methinks
when
the
others
go
one
man
should
stay
to
tend
the
fires
until
the
flame
gets
fair
hold
and
that
man
i
said
roger
no
no
frowned
walkyn
an
one
of
us
must
die
it
shall
be
me
but
now
came
the
ancient
man
leaning
upon
his
ancient
weapon
no
children
said
he
is
for
age
to
die
death
is
sweet
to
the
old
and
weary
so
will
i
tend
the
fire
yet
beseech
thee
grant
me
this
that
these
my
hands
shall
fire
the
gallows
whereon
they
hanged
my
son
long
ago
young
was
he
and
tall
scarce
yet
a
man
they
hanged
him
yonder
so
high
so
high
so
far
beyond
my
care
and
the
carrion
birds
kites
see
you
and
crows
and
the
wind
and
rain
and
dark
ah
god
my
son
i
am
but
an
old
man
and
feeble
yet
beseech
thee
let
this
be
the
hand
to
fire
black
ivo
gibbet
then
beltane
took
from
his
pouch
flint
and
steel
and
tinder
and
gave
them
to
the
old
man
trembling
fingers
as
giles
o
the
bow
came
running
with
the
stalwart
friar
behind
him
so
while
the
five
stood
hushed
and
wide
of
eye
the
old
man
knelt
before
them
in
his
rags
and
struck
flint
to
steel
once
he
struck
and
twice
and
behold
a
spark
that
leapt
to
a
small
flame
that
died
to
a
glow
but
now
flat
upon
his
belly
lay
giles
and
pursing
his
lips
puffed
and
blew
until
the
glow
brightened
spread
and
burst
into
a
crackling
flame
that
leapt
from
twig
to
twig
and
when
the
fire
waxed
hot
beltane
took
thence
a
glowing
brand
and
coming
to
the
other
great
pile
fired
it
therewith
up
rose
the
flames
high
and
higher
until
they
began
to
lick
about
the
gibbet
two
great
supporting
timbers
and
ever
as
they
rose
walkyn
and
roger
giles
and
the
friar
laboured
amain
stacking
logs
near
by
wherewith
to
feed
the
fires
enough
said
beltane
at
last
it
shall
suffice
methinks
suffice
cried
the
old
man
his
eyes
bright
in
the
ruddy
glow
aye
it
shall
suffice
sweet
boy
see
see
the
timbers
catch
now
ha
burn
good
fire
eat
hungry
flame
o
happy
sight
would
my
dear
son
were
here
they
hanged
his
fair
young
body
but
his
soul
ha
his
soul
o
souls
of
hanged
men
o
spirits
of
the
dead
come
about
me
ye
ghosts
of
murdered
youth
come
and
behold
the
gibbet
burn
whereon
ye
died
what
are
ye
there
amid
the
smoke
so
soon
come
then
let
us
dance
together
and
trip
it
lightly
to
and
fro
merrily
merrily
hey
boy
so
ho
then
so
ho
and
away
we
go
hereupon
tossing
up
gaunt
arms
the
old
man
fell
to
dancing
and
capering
amid
the
sparks
and
rolling
smoke
filling
the
air
with
wild
talk
and
gabbling
laughter
that
rose
above
the
roar
of
the
fires
and
so
in
a
while
beltane
sighing
turned
and
led
the
way
down
the
hill
towards
the
glooming
shadow
of
the
woods
but
ever
as
they
went
the
flames
waxed
fiercer
behind
them
and
the
madman
laughter
shrilled
upon
the
air
they
plunged
into
the
underbrush
and
thus
hidden
began
to
close
in
upon
belsaye
town
and
of
a
sudden
they
heard
a
cry
and
thereafter
the
shattering
blare
of
a
trumpet
upon
the
walls
and
now
from
within
the
waking
city
rose
a
confused
sound
a
hum
that
grew
louder
and
ever
more
loud
pierced
by
shout
and
while
high
above
this
growing
clamour
the
tocsin
pealed
alarm
thus
in
a
while
the
trembling
citizens
of
belsaye
starting
from
their
slumber
stared
in
pallid
amaze
beholding
afar
a
great
and
fiery
gibbet
whose
flames
leaping
heavenward
seemed
to
quench
the
moon
chapter
xiii
how
they
brake
ope
the
dungeon
of
belsaye
being
yet
in
the
shade
of
the
woods
beltane
paused
hearkening
to
the
distant
uproar
of
belsaye
town
and
watching
the
torches
that
hovered
upon
its
walls
and
the
cressets
that
glowed
on
tower
and
bartizan
messire
beltane
quoth
the
friar
setting
his
rumpled
frock
in
order
are
ye
minded
still
to
adventure
breaking
ope
the
dungeon
of
belsaye
aye
verily
nodded
beltane
know
you
the
city
good
friar
that
do
i
my
brother
every
lane
and
street
every
hole
and
corner
of
it
was
there
i
first
drew
breath
a
fair
rich
city
freed
by
charter
long
ago
but
now
alas
its
freedom
snatched
away
its
ancient
charter
gone
it
bleeds
a
tyrant
sway
a
pallid
man
who
laughs
to
see
men
die
and
smiles
upon
their
anguish
o
belsaye
grievous
are
thy
wrongs
since
ivo
came
five
years
agone
and
gave
thee
up
to
pillage
and
to
ravishment
o
hateful
day
o
day
of
shame
what
sights
i
saw
what
sounds
i
heard
and
screams
of
women
to
rend
high
heaven
and
shake
the
throne
of
god
methinks
i
see
i
hear
them
yet
and
must
forever
jesu
pity
and
leaning
against
a
tree
near
by
the
stalwart
friar
shivered
violently
and
hid
his
eyes
why
good
brother
martin
said
beltane
setting
an
arm
about
him
doth
memory
pain
thee
so
indeed
good
brother
martin
be
comforted
nay
nay
is
past
but
o
my
son
i
had
a
sister
said
the
good
friar
and
groaned
yet
in
a
while
he
raised
his
head
and
spake
again
and
when
duke
ivo
had
wrought
his
will
upon
the
city
he
builded
the
great
gibbet
yonder
and
hanged
it
full
with
men
cheek
by
jowl
and
left
sir
gui
the
cruel
with
ten
score
chosen
men
for
garrison
but
the
men
of
belsaye
have
stubborn
memories
sir
gui
and
his
butchers
slumber
in
a
false
security
for
stern
men
are
they
and
strong
and
wait
but
appointed
time
pray
god
that
time
be
soon
amen
said
beltane
now
even
as
he
spake
came
the
sound
of
a
distant
tucket
the
great
gates
of
belsaye
swung
wide
and
forth
rode
a
company
of
their
bascinets
agleam
the
moon
now
spake
the
friar
and
you
are
for
belsaye
my
brother
follow
me
i
know
a
way
albeit
a
moist
way
and
something
evil
but
an
you
will
follow
come
so
saying
friar
martin
set
off
among
the
trees
and
beltane
beckoning
to
the
others
followed
close
fast
strode
the
friar
his
white
robe
fluttering
on
before
through
moonlight
and
shadow
until
they
reached
a
brook
or
freshet
that
ran
bubbling
betwixt
flowery
banks
beside
this
strode
the
tall
friar
following
its
winding
course
until
before
them
amid
the
shadow
yet
darker
than
the
shadow
loomed
high
an
embattled
flanking
tower
of
the
walls
of
belsaye
town
but
ever
before
them
flitted
the
friar
white
gown
on
and
on
until
the
freshet
became
a
river
barring
their
advance
a
broad
river
that
whispered
among
the
reeds
on
the
one
side
and
lapped
against
rugged
wall
on
the
other
here
the
friar
stayed
to
glance
from
gloomy
wall
and
turret
to
fast
waning
moon
on
their
left
then
girding
up
his
gown
he
stepped
down
into
the
reeds
and
a
moment
later
they
saw
him
to
their
amaze
fording
the
river
that
flowed
scarce
knee
deep
so
needfully
beltane
followed
and
stepping
into
the
water
found
his
feet
upon
a
narrow
causeway
cunningly
devised
thus
slowly
and
carefully
because
of
the
flowing
of
the
water
they
came
betimes
to
where
the
friar
waited
in
the
shadow
of
the
massy
wall
yet
even
as
they
came
near
the
friar
waved
his
arm
stooped
and
was
gone
whereon
my
beltane
stared
amazed
and
the
three
muttered
uneasily
behind
him
but
coming
nearer
beltane
espied
above
the
hurrying
waters
the
curve
of
an
arch
or
tunnel
and
pointing
it
to
the
others
took
a
great
breath
and
stooping
beneath
the
water
stumbled
on
and
on
until
it
shallowed
and
he
was
free
to
breathe
again
on
he
went
through
water
now
with
slimy
walls
above
him
and
around
seeing
naught
by
reason
of
the
pitchy
blackness
and
hearing
only
the
smothered
splash
of
those
behind
and
gasping
breaths
that
boomed
hollow
in
the
dark
yet
presently
he
saw
a
gleam
before
him
that
broadened
with
each
step
and
of
a
sudden
was
out
beneath
the
sky
a
narrow
strip
wherein
stars
twinkled
and
so
beheld
again
friar
martin
white
frock
flitting
on
before
in
a
while
he
brought
them
to
a
slimy
stair
and
climbing
this
with
ever
growing
caution
they
found
themselves
at
last
beneath
the
frowning
shadow
of
the
citadel
within
the
walls
of
belsaye
town
now
looking
north
beltane
beheld
afar
a
fiery
gallows
that
flamed
to
heaven
and
from
the
town
thitherward
came
a
confused
hum
of
the
multitude
who
watched
but
hereabouts
the
town
seemed
all
deserted
the
dungeons
lie
beneath
our
feet
whispered
friar
martin
come
so
keeping
ever
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
square
keep
they
went
on
and
alert
of
eye
till
being
come
to
the
angle
of
the
wall
the
friar
stayed
of
a
sudden
and
raised
a
warning
hand
then
came
beltane
with
walkyn
close
behind
and
peering
over
the
friar
broad
shoulders
they
beheld
a
sentinel
who
stood
with
his
back
to
them
leaning
on
his
spear
to
watch
the
burning
gallows
his
agleam
and
his
glittering
as
he
stirred
lazily
in
time
to
the
merry
lilt
he
sang
softly
then
or
ever
beltane
could
stay
him
walkyn
o
the
dene
laid
by
his
axe
and
his
soaked
shoes
soundless
upon
the
stones
began
to
steal
upon
the
unconscious
singer
who
yet
lolled
upon
his
spear
some
thirty
paces
away
with
great
body
bowed
forward
and
hairy
fingers
crooked
walkyn
stole
upon
him
six
paces
he
went
ten
twenty
the
soldier
ceased
his
humming
stood
erect
and
turned
about
and
walkyn
leapt
bore
him
backward
down
into
the
shadow
a
shadow
wherein
their
bodies
writhed
and
twisted
silently
awhile
when
walkyn
rose
out
of
the
shadow
and
beckoned
them
on
so
following
ever
the
friar
lead
they
came
to
a
narrow
doorway
that
gave
upon
a
small
lighted
by
a
smoking
torch
socketed
to
the
wall
the
place
was
empty
save
for
a
medley
of
arms
stacked
in
corners
wherefore
treading
cautiously
the
friar
led
them
a
narrow
passage
and
so
to
a
second
and
larger
chamber
where
burned
a
fire
of
logs
upon
the
walls
hung
shining
cloaks
and
mantles
lay
where
they
had
been
flung
on
bench
and
floor
but
none
was
there
to
give
them
let
or
hindrance
then
friar
martin
took
a
torch
that
smoked
near
by
and
crossing
to
the
hearth
reached
down
a
massy
key
from
the
wall
and
with
this
in
his
hand
came
to
a
door
half
hidden
in
a
corner
beyond
which
were
steps
that
wound
downwards
into
the
dark
a
darkness
close
and
dank
and
heavy
with
corruption
but
on
went
the
friar
his
torch
lighting
the
way
down
and
ever
down
until
they
trod
a
narrow
way
reeking
walls
where
breathed
an
air
so
close
and
foul
the
very
torch
languished
at
length
the
friar
stopped
before
a
mighty
door
with
iron
bars
and
with
massy
bolts
and
while
beltane
held
the
torch
he
fitted
key
to
lock
and
thereafter
the
great
door
swung
on
screaming
hinge
and
showed
a
dungeon
beyond
a
place
foul
and
noisome
where
divers
wretches
lay
or
crouched
blinking
in
the
torch
glare
what
cried
one
coming
to
his
feet
a
squat
man
be
this
the
dawn
so
soon
well
we
be
ready
better
to
hang
i
the
clean
air
than
rot
in
a
dungeon
say
i
so
we
be
ready
eh
my
brothers
but
now
some
groaned
and
wept
and
others
laughed
while
yet
others
got
them
to
their
knees
bowed
of
head
and
silent
then
went
in
the
friar
to
them
and
laid
his
hands
upon
the
squat
man
shoulder
and
spake
him
gently
and
is
it
osric
said
he
day
is
not
yet
my
son
nor
with
the
day
shalt
thou
die
nor
any
here
an
ye
be
silent
all
and
follow
where
we
lead
so
will
we
bring
you
to
god
good
world
again
rise
then
each
one
speak
nothing
but
follow
so
then
did
these
men
snatched
of
a
sudden
from
the
horror
of
death
to
the
hope
of
new
life
follow
on
stumbling
feet
out
from
the
noisome
gloom
of
the
dungeon
out
from
the
clammy
air
breathing
of
death
up
the
narrow
winding
stair
and
with
each
step
came
strength
and
manhood
thus
as
they
strode
forth
of
the
frowning
keep
each
man
bore
sword
or
gisarm
so
with
breath
in
cheek
but
hearts
they
came
one
and
all
to
where
the
slimy
stair
led
down
into
the
gloom
yet
here
friar
martin
paused
sighing
to
look
behind
whence
rose
the
distant
hum
of
those
thronging
townsfolk
who
yet
crowded
wall
and
street
and
market
square
to
watch
the
gallows
burn
now
sweet
christ
shield
ye
good
people
of
belsaye
he
sighed
what
mean
ye
my
brother
questioned
beltane
alas
my
son
groaned
the
friar
i
needs
must
think
upon
the
coming
day

of

vengeance
of

work

his
custom

quoth
my
beltane
knitting
his
brows

and
with
the
word
he
turned
him
back
drawing
on
his
hood
of
mail

whispered
black
roger
in
his
ear

while

the

with

beyond

and

freedom
and
to
safety
within
bourne
then

whispered
roger
hoarse
and
eager
as
the
friar
turned
to
follow
the
others
adown
the
slippery
stair
beseech
thee
lord
thy
man

i
twice
sworn
to

till

so

with
the
friar
my
roger
and
so
farewell
to
each
god
keep
thee
noble
son
whispered
the
friar
his
hand
upraised
in
blessing
but
roger
stood
chin
on
breast
and
spake
no
word
then
beltane
turned
him
and
sped
away
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
keep
the
waning
moon
cast
shadows
black
and
long
and
in
these
shadows
beltane
crept
and
so
betimes
came
within
the
outer
and
to
the
room
beyond
and
here
beheld
a
doorway
whence
steps
led
upward
a
narrow
stair
gloomy
and
winding
whose
velvet
blackness
was
stabbed
here
and
there
by
moonlight
flooding
through
some
up
he
went
and
up
pausing
once
with
breath
in
check
fancying
he
heard
the
stealthy
sound
of
one
who
climbed
behind
him
in
the
black
void
below
thus
stayed
he
a
moment
with
eyes
that
strove
to
pierce
the
gloom
and
with
naked
dagger
clenched
to
smite
yet
heard
nought
save
the
faint
whisper
of
his
own
mail
and
the
soft
tap
of
his
long
scabbard
against
the
wall
wherefore
he
presently
sped
on
again
climbing
swiftly
up
the
narrow
stair
thus
in
a
while
he
beheld
a
door
above
a
small
door
yet
stout
and
strong
a
door
that
stood
ajar
whence
came
a
beam
of
yellow
light
so
with
sure
and
steady
hand
beltane
set
wide
the
door
that
creaked
faintly
in
the
stillness
and
beheld
a
small
square
chamber
where
was
a
narrow
window
and
in
this
window
a
man
lolled
his
unhelmed
head
thrust
far
without
to
watch
the
glow
that
leapt
against
the
northern
sky
then
beltane
sheathed
his
dagger
and
in
three
long
strides
was
close
behind
and
stooping
above
the
man
sought
and
found
his
hairy
throat
and
swung
him
that
his
head
struck
the
wall
then
beltane
sighing
laid
him
upon
the
floor
and
turned
toward
a
certain
arch
but
or
ever
his
hand
came
upon
this
curtain
from
beyond
a
voice
hailed
a
voice
soft
and
musical
hugo
o
hugo
spawn
of
hell
hither
to
me
then
beltane
lifting
the
curtain
opened
the
door
and
striding
into
the
chamber
beyond
closed
and
barred
the
door
behind
him
and
so
stood
tall
and
menacing
looking
on
one
who
sat
at
a
table
busied
with
pen
and
a
slender
man
this
and
richly
habited
a
man
pale
of
cheek
with
long
nose
and
mouth
and
masterful
who
presently
lifting
his
head
stared
up
in
amaze
no
longer
for
now
beholding
beltane
the
mighty
sheathed
in
mail
from
head
to
foot
the
pen
dropped
from
his
fingers
and
his
long
pale
hands
slowly
clenched
themselves
so
for
a
space
they
fronted
each
other
speaking
not
while
eye
met
eye
unswerving
the
menacing
blue
and
the
challenging
black
and
through
the
open
casement
near
by
came
a
ruddy
glow
that
flickered
on
wall
and
rugged
now
raising
his
hand
beltane
pointed
toward
this
glowing
window
sir
gui
quoth
he
lord
seneschal
of
belsaye

unswerving

sir
gui
sat
on
his
thin
lips
upcurling
to
a
smile
his
black
eyes
unswerving
wherefore
came
beltane
and
seized
him
in
fierce
hands
and
plucked
him
to
his
feet
and
so
brought
him
to
the
window

pale

beltane
pointed
of
a
sudden
to
where
the
great
gallows
outlined
against
the
night
in
seething
flame
swayed
to
and
fro
crumbled
and
crashed
to
earth
whirling
sparks
and
flame
while
from
the
town
below
rose
a
murmur
that
swelled
and
swelled
to
a
shout
and
so
was
gone
behold
lord
seneschal
black
ivo
gallows
hath
ceased
to
be
here
is
a
sign
let
those
heed
it
that
will
but
for
thee
this
have
i
burned
this
gallows
have
i
freed
thy
prisoners
upon
me
therefore
and
only
me
be
the
penalty
for
mark
me
this
seneschal
spill
but
one
drop
of
blood
of
these
innocents
of
belsaye
and
as
god
seeth
me
so
will
i
hunt
thee
down
and
take
thee
and
tear
out
thine
eyes
and
cut

thine
hands
and
drive
thee
forth
to
starve
and
this
do
i
swear
by
the
honour
of
my
father
beltane
the
strong
duke
of
pentavalon
but
now
even
as
sir
gui
shrank
back
before
the
death
in
look
amazed
beyond
all
thought
by
his
words
came
a
sudden
shout
and
thereafter
a
clash
and
ring
of
steel
upon
the
stair
without
and
now
above
the
sudden
din
hoarse
and
loud
a
arose
at
the
sound
of
which
sir
gui
jaws
hung
agape
and
he
stood
as
one
that
doubts
his
ears
for
was
a
cry
he
had
heard
aforetime
long
ago
arise
arise
i
will
arise
then
beltane
cast
up
the
bar
and
plucking
wide
the
door
beheld
the
broad
back
of
one
who
held
the
narrow
stair
where
flashed
pike
and
gisarm
roger
he
called
black
roger
aye
lord
is
i
cried
roger
parrying
a
make
sure
of
thy
work
master
i
can
hold
these
in
check
yet
a
while
my
work
is
done
roger
to
me
to
me
i
say
so
roger
leaping
back
from
the
turned
about
and
ran
to
beltane
stumbling
and
spattering
blood
as
he
came
whereupon
beltane
the
door
and
barred
it
in
the
face
of
the
pursuit
a
while
leaned
roger
panting
against
the
wall
then
beholding
sir
gui
how
he
cried
lives
the
pale
fox
yet
methought
thy
work
was
done
master
so
saying
he
swung
aloft
his
bloody
sword
but
even
as
the
seneschal
waited
the
blow
smiling
of
lip
beltane
caught
black
wrist
stay
cried
he
above
the
thunder
of
blows
that
shook
the
door
slay
a
man
unarmed
aye
master
as
he
hath
slain
many
a
man
ere
now
quoth
roger
striving
to
free
his
arm
the
door
is
giving
and
there
be
many
without
and
since
we
must
die
so
let
us
slay
the
white
fox
first
not
so
said
beltane
get
you
through
the
window
the
river
runs
below
through
the
window
out
i
say
and
with
the
word
he
stooped
and
bore
black
roger
to
the
window
but
lord
jump
cried
beltane
jump
ere
the
door
fall
but
you
master
jump
i
say
i
will
follow
thee
so
groaning
black
roger
hurled
his
sword
far
out
from
the
window
and
leaping
from
the
sill
was
gone
then
beltane
turned
and
looked
upon
gui
of
allerdale
seneschal
said
he
i
who
speak
am
he
who
an
god
so
wills
shall
be
duke
of
pentavalon
ere
long
howbeit
i
will
keep
my
promise
to
thee
so
aid
me
god
thus
saying
he
mounted
the
window
in
his
turn
and
even
as
the
door
splintered
behind
him
forced
himself
through
and
leaping
wide
whirled
over
and
over
down
and
down
and
the
sluggish
river
closed
over
him
with
a
mighty
splash
thereafter
the
placid
waters
went
upon
their
way
bubbling
here
and
there
and
dimpling
the
waning
moon
chapter
xiv
how
beltane
came
nigh
to
death
down
went
my
beltane
weighted
in
his
heavy
mail
down
and
ever
down
through
a
world
of
green
that
grew
dark
and
ever
more
dark
until
within
the
pitchy
gloom
beneath
him
was
a
quaking
slime
that
sucked
viciously
at
foot
and
ankle
desperately
he
fought
and
strove
to
rise
but
ever
the
mud
clung
and
lusty
swimmer
though
he
was
his
triple
mail
bore
him
down
and
now
his
mighty
muscles
failed
lights
flamed
before
his
eyes
in
his
ears
was
a
drone
that
grew
to
a
rushing
roar
his
lungs
seemed
bursting
and
the
quaking
ooze
yearning
to
engulf
him
then
my
beltane
knew
the
bitter
agony
of
coming
death
and
strove
no
more
but
in
that
place
of
darkness
and
horror
a
clammy
something
crawled
upon
his
face
slipped
down
upon
his
helpless
body
seized
hold
upon
his
belt
and
dragged
at
him
fierce
and
strong
slowly
slowly
the
darkness
thinned
grew
lighter
and
then
ah
kind
mercy
of
god
his
staring
eyes
beheld
the
orbed
moon
his
famished
lungs
drank
deep
the
sweet
cool
air
of
night
and
so
he
gasped
and
gasping
strove
feebly
with
arm
and
leg
while
ever
the
strong
hand
grasped
at
his
girdle
and
now
he
heard
faint
and
afar
a
sound
of
voices
hands
reached
down
and
drew
him
up
up
to
good
firm
earth
and
there
face
down
among
the
grass
he
lay
awhile
content
only
to
live
and
breathe
gradually
he
became
aware
of
another
sound
hard
by
a
sharp
sound
yet
musical
and
in
a
little
knew
it
for
the
twang
of
a
now
glancing
up
beltane
beheld
an
ancient
tree
near
by
a
tree
warped
and
stunted
wherein
divers
arrows
stood
and
behind
the
tree
giles
o
the
bow
who
as
he
watched
drew
and
loosed
a
shaft
which
flashing
upward
was
answered
by
a
cry
whereon
giles
laughed
aloud
six
he
cried
six
in
seven
shots
is
sweet
archery
methinks
and
quicker
than
a
noose
my
rogerkin
and
more
deadly
than
thy
axe
my
surly
walkyn
let
the
rogues
yonder
but
show
themselves
and
give
me
arrows
enow
so
will
i
slay
all
gui
garrison
ere
the
moon
fail
me
quite
but
hereupon
beltane
got
him
to
his
knees
and
made
shift
to
stand
and
coming
to
the
tree
leaned
there
being
faint
and
much
spent
aha
sweet
lord
cried
the
archer
a
man
after
my
very
heart
art
thou
what
wonders
have
we
achieved
this
night
paladins
in
sooth
we
be
all
four
by
the
blessed
bones
of
giles
all
pentavalon
shall
ring
with
our
doings
anon
said
beltane
faintly
where
is
my
good
roger
here
lord
a
voice
answered
from
the
shade
of
a
bush
hard
by
was
my
comrade
walkyn
dragged
me
up
from
death
even
as
he
did
thee
we
thought
you
gone
for
good
master
aye
cried
the
archer
so
would
ye
all
be
dead
methinks
but
for
me
and
this
my
bow
friends
said
beltane
is
by
doings
such
as
this
that
men
do
learn
each
other
worth
so
shall
the
bonds
betwixt
us
strengthen
day
by
day
and
join
us
in
accord
and
brotherhood
that
shall
outlast
this
puny
life
so
now
let
us
begone
and
join
the
others
so
they
turned
their
backs
upon
belsaye
town
and
keeping
to
the
brush
came
at
length
to
where
upon
the
borders
of
the
forest
the
white
friar
waited
them
with
the
nine
who
yet
remained
of
the
prisoners
these
beholding
beltane
came
hurrying
to
meet
him
and
falling
upon
their
knees
about
him
strove
with
each
other
to
kiss
his
hands
and
feet
good
fellows
said
beltane
god
hath
this
night
brought
ye
out
of
death
into
life
how
will
ye
use
your
lives
hereafter
list
now
even
as
ye
have
suffered
others
are
suffering
as
ye
have
endured
the
gloom
of
dungeon
and
fear
of
death
so
at
this
hour
others
do
the
like
by
reason
of
misrule
and
tyranny
now
here
stand
i
together
with
sir
benedict
of
bourne
who
holdeth
thrasfordham
keep
pledged
to
live
henceforth
sword
in
hand
until
these
evils
are
no
more
since
is
only
by
bitter
strife
and
conflict
that
evil
may
be
driven
from
our
borders
thus
pentavalon
needeth
men
and
resolute
if
such
ye
be
march
ye
this
hour
to
thrasfordham
within
bourne
and
say
to
sir
benedict
that
god
having
given
you
new
life
so
now
will
ye
give
your
lives
to
pentavalon
that
tyranny
may
cease
and
the
duchy
be
cleansed
of
evil
who
now
among
ye
will
draw
sword
for
freedom
and

then
sprang
the
squat
man
osric
to
his
feet
with
clenched
fist
upraised
and
eyes
ablaze
his
matted
hair
that
will
i
he
cried
and
i
and

and
i
cried

rest
and
eager

but
swords
and
one
to
lead
and
we
will
follow
quoth
beltane
go
you
then
to
sir
benedict
within
bourne
and
say
to
all
men
that
beltane
the
duke
hath
this
night
burned
down
black
ivo
shameful
gibbet
for
a
sign
that
he
is
come
at
last
and
is
at
work
nor
will
he
stay
until
he
die
or
pentavalon
be
free
chapter
xv
how
beltane
had
word
with
pertolepe
the
red
and
how
they
left
him
in
the
forest
since
all
men
breathing
the
sky
good
or
evil
soon
must
die
ho
bring
me
wine
and
what
care
i
for
dying
it
was
giles
brabblecombe
singing
to
himself
as
he
knelt
beside
a
fire
of
twigs
and
beltane
opening
sleepy
eyes
looked
round
upon
a
world
all
green
and
gold
and
a
fair
world
and
fragrant
whose
balmy
air
breathed
of
hidden
flowers
and
blooming
thickets
whence
came
the
joyous
carolling
of
birds
and
beholding
all
this
and
the
glory
of
it
my
beltane
must
needs
praise
god
he
was
alive
hail
and
good
morrow
to
thee
brother
cried
the
bowman
seeing
him
astir
the
sun
shineth
look
you
i
sit
upon
my
hams
and
sing
for
that
this
roasting
venison
smelleth
sweet
while
yonder
i
the
leaves
be
a
mavis
and
a
merle
of
me
pretty
rogues
for
each
and
ever
of
which
deo
amen
why
truly
god
hath
made
a
fair
world
giles
a
good
world
to
live
in
and
to
live
is
to
act
yet
here
have
i
lain
most
basely
sleeping
like
any
paunched
friar
brother
but
a
few
days
since
i
met
thee
in
the
green
a
very
gentle
youth
that
yet
became
a
very
lion
of
fight
and
of
battle
heroes
were
we
all
last
night
nay
very
titans
four
an
army
whiles
now
within
this
morn
you
shall
see
walkyn
o
the
bloody
axe
with
grim
black
rogerkin
down
at
the
brook
yonder
upon
their
bellies
busily
trout
for
breakfast
while
i
whose
good
yew
bow
carrieth
death
in
every
twang
toasting
on
a
twig
am
mocked
of
wanton
warblers
i
the
green
and
thou
who
art
an
achilles
a
hector
an
ajax
a
very
mars
do
sleep
and
slumber
soft
and
sweet
as
friar
heigho
yet
even
a
must
nod
betimes
and
titans
eat
look
ye
now
looking
from
sun
to
earth
and
beholding
the
shortening
of
the
shadows
beltane
leapt
up
quoth
he
sluggard
that
i
am
is
late
and
roger
was
wounded
last
night
i
mind
content
you
brother
was
nought
said
giles
bending
above
his
cooking
the
kiss
of
a
i
the
thick
o
the
arm
no
more
yet
it
must
be
looked
to
i
did
it
brother
as
i
shoot
that
is
to
say
i
did
it
most
excellent
well
be
healed
within
the
week
how
then
art
leech
as
well
as
bowman
quite
as
well
brother
when
i
was
a
monk
i
learned
two
good
things
never
to
argue
with
those
in
authority
over
me
and
to
heal
the
hurts
of
those
that
did
so
by
my
skill
in
herbs
and
leechcraft
roger
having
a
hole
in
his
arm
recks
not
of
it
behold
here
he
cometh
and
walkyn
too
and
deo
with
a
trout
now
shall
we
feast
like
any
pampered
prelate
so
when
beltane
had
stripped
and
bathed
him
in
the
brook
they
presently
sat
down
all
four
together
and
ate
and
talked
and
laughed
right
merrily
the
while
lark
and
thrush
and
blackbird
carolled
lustily
far
and
near
now
eat
brothers
cried
the
bowman
eat
and
spare
not
as
i
do
for
i
smell
the
battle
from
afar
ho
ho
the
noise
of
captains
and
the
shouting
yesterday
were
we
heroes
must
we
be
gods
yet
cautious
gods
for
mark
me
i
have
but
twelve
shafts
remaining
and
with
twelve
shafts
can
but
promise
ye
a
poor
twelve
lives
but
now
came
roger
and
with
belt
in
his
hand
master
quoth
he
last
night
did
we
four
rescue
twelve
now
i
fain
to
know
if
for
these
twelve
i
may
cut
twelve
notches
from
my
belt
or
must
we
share
their
lives
betwixt
us
and
i
count
but
three
three
laughed
giles
oho
out
upon
thee
rogerkin
our
lord
here
claimeth
six
since
he
the
rescue
planned
next
i
claim
three
since
but
for
my
goodly
shooting
ye
all
had
died
then
hath
walkyn
two
since
he
saved
thee
from
the
fishes
which
leaveth
thee
one
erat
demonstrandum
but
now
seeing
roger
downcast
look
giles
snatched
the
belt
and
gave
it
unto
beltane
who
forthwith
cut
twelve
notches
and
in
a
while
having
made
an
end
of
eating
beltane
rose
and
looked
round
upon
the
three
good
comrades
all
quoth
he
well
do
i
know
ye
to
be
staunch
and
trusty
yet
am
i
minded
to
speak
with
him
men
call
pertolepe
the
red
lest
he
shed
innocent
blood
for
that
we
slew
his
foresters
twenty
lusty
fellows
nodded
giles
with
a
morsel
of
venison
on
his
dagger
point
nay
there
one
escaped
quoth
roger
yet
he
sore
wounded
said
walkyn
ha
sir
pertolepe
is
a
terrible
lord
quoth
giles
eyeing
the
morsel
of
venison
somewhat
askance
be
a
desperate
adventure
methinks
and
we
but
four
yet
each
and
all
gods
quoth
walkyn
reaching
for
his
axe
aye
nodded
giles
frowning
at
the
piece
of
venison
yet
are
we
but
four
gods
not
so
answered
beltane
for
in
this
thing
shall
we
be
but
one
go
you
three
to
bourne
for
i
am
minded
to
try
this
adventure
alone
alone
master
cried
black
roger
starting
to
his
feet
alone
growled
walkyn
clutching
his
axe
an
death
must
come
better
one
should
die
than
four
said
beltane
howbeit
i
am
minded
to
seek
out
pertolepe
this
day
then
do
i
come
also
master
since
thy
man
am
i
i
too
nodded
walkyn
come
death
and
welcome
so
i
but
stand
face
to
face
with
pertolepe
alack
sighed
giles
so
needs
must
i
come
also
since
i
have
twelve
shafts
yet
unsped
and
he
swallowed
the
morsel
of
venison
with
mighty
relish
and
gusto
then
laughed
beltane
for
very
gladness
and
he
looked
on
each
with
kindling
eye
good
friends
quoth
he
as
ye
say
so
let
it
be
and
may
god
hand
be
over
us
this
day
now
as
he
spake
with
eyes
uplift
to
heaven
he
espied
a
faint
blue
mist
far
away
above
the
tree
tops
a
distant
haze
that
rose
lazily
into
the
balmy
air
thickening
ever
as
he
watched
ah
he
exclaimed
of
a
sudden
and
pointing
with
rigid
finger
whence
cometh
that
smoke
think
ye
why
quoth
roger
frowning
wendonmere
village
lieth
yonder
nay
is
nearer
than
wendonmere
said
walkyn
shouldering
his
axe
see
the
smoke
thickens
cried
beltane
now
god
forgive
me
the
while
i
tarry
here
red
pertolepe
is
busy
meseemeth
so
saying
he
caught
up
his
sword
and
incontinent
set
off
at
speed
toward
where
the
soft
blue
haze
stole
upon
the
air
of
morning
growing
denser
and
ever
denser
fast
and
furious
beltane
sped
on
crashing
through
underbrush
and
crackling
thicket
bush
and
brook
and
fallen
tree
heedful
of
eye
and
choosing
his
course
with
a
forester
unerring
instinct
praying
fiercely
beneath
his
breath
and
with
the
three
ever
close
behind
would
i
had
eaten
less
panted
giles
would
our
legs
were
longer
growled
walkyn
would
my
belt
bore
fewer
notches
quoth
roger
and
so
they
ran
together
and
swift
and
ever
as
they
ran
the
smoke
grew
denser
and
ever
beltane
prayers
more
fervent
now
in
a
while
they
heard
a
sound
faint
and
confused
a
hum
that
presently
grew
to
a
murmur
to
a
drone
to
a
low
wailing
of
voices
pierced
of
a
sudden
by
a
shrill
cry
no
man
lips
could
utter
that
swelled
high
upon
the
air
and
died
lost
amid
the
growing
clamour
they
fired
the
ricks
first
panted
roger
is
ever
way
they
be
torturing
the
women
hissed
walkyn
is
ever
so
red
pertolepe
pleasure
and
i
have
but
twelve
arrows
left
me
groaned
giles
but
beltane
ran
in
silence
looking
neither
right
nor
left
until
above
the
hum
of
voices
he
heard
one
upraised
in
passionate
supplication
followed
by
another
a
loud
voice
and
jovial
and
thereafter
a
burst
of
roaring
laughter
soon
beltane
beheld
a
stream
that
flowed
athwart
their
way
and
beyond
the
stream
a
line
of
willows
thick
growing
upon
the
marge
and
again
beyond
these
clustering
willows
the
straggling
village
lay
then
beltane
motioning
the
others
to
caution
forded
the
stream
and
coming
in
the
shade
of
the
osiers
drew
on
his
hood
of
mail
and
so
unsheathing
his
long
sword
peered
through
the
leaves
and
this
is
what
he
saw
a
wide
road
flanked
by
rows
of
scattered
cottages
rude
of
wall
and
thatch
a
dusty
road
that
led
away
east
and
west
into
the
cool
depths
of
the
forest
and
a
cringing
huddle
of
wretched
village
folk
whose
pallid
faces
were
all
set
one
way
where
some
score
of
lolled
in
their
saddles
watching
a
tall
young
maid
who
struggled
fiercely
in
the
grasp
of
two
lusty
fellows
her
garments
rent
her
white
flesh
agleam
in
the
sunlight
a
comely
maid
supple
and
strong
who
ever
as
she
strove
the
clutching
hands
that
held
her
kept
her
blazing
eyes
turned
upon
one
in
knightly
mail
who
sat
upon
a
great
hard
by
watching
her
big
chin
in
big
mailed
fist
and
with
wide
lips
in
a
smile
a
strong
man
this
heavy
and
broad
of
chest
his
casque
hung
at
his
and
his
thrown
back
upon
his
wide
shoulders
showed
his
thick
red
hair
that
fell
framing
his
rugged
face
ha
cuthbert
quoth
he
turning
to
one
who
rode
at
his
elbow
a
slender
youth
who
stared
with
evil
eyes
and
sucked
upon
his
finger
aha
by
the
fiend
is
a
sweet
armful
sir
squire
aye
my
lord
pertolepe
is
rarely
shaped
and
delicately
fleshed
answered
the
esquire
and
so
fell
to
sucking
his
finger
again
what
silly
wench
will
ye
defy
me
still
cried
sir
pertolepe
jovial
of
voice
must
ye
to
the
whip
in
sooth
ho
ralph
otho
strip
me
this
stubborn
jade
so
ha
verily
cuthbert
hast
shrewd
eyes
is
a
dainty
rogue
come
said
he
smiling
down
into
the
girl
wide
fierce
eyes
save
that
fair
body
o
thine
from
the
lash
now
and
speak
me
where
is
thy
father
and
brother
that
i
may
do
justice
on
them
along
with
these
other
dogs
for
the
foul
murder
of
my
foresters
their
end
shall
be
swift
look
ye
and
as
for
thyself
shalt
find
those
to
comfort
thee
anon
speak
wench
but
now
came
a
woman
pale
and
worn
who
threw
herself
on
trembling
knees
at
sir
pertolepe
stirrup
and
bowed
thus
before
him
in
the
dust
raised
a
passionate
outcry
supplicating
his
mercy
with
bitter
tears
and
clasped
hands
lifted
heavenwards
o
good
my
lord
pertolepe
she
wailed
was
not
my
husband
nor
son
nor
any
man
of
our
village
wrought
this
thing
innocent
are
we
my
lord
o
witch
quoth
he
who
bade
thee
speak
so
saying
he
drew
foot
from
stirrup
and
kicked
her
back
into
the
dust
ho
whips
he
called
lay
on
and
thereafter
will
we
hang
these
vermin
to
their
own
and
fire
their
hovels
for
a
warning
but
now
even
as
the
struggling
maid
was
dragged
forward
even
as
pertolepe
smiling
settled
chin
on
fist
to
watch
the
lithe
play
of
her
writhing
limbs
the
willows
behind
him
swayed
and
parted
to
a
sudden
leap
and
a
arm
was
about
sir
pertolepe
a
mighty
arm
that
bore
him
from
the
saddle
and
hurled
him
headlong
and
thereafter
sir
pertolepe
half
stunned
and
staring
up
from
the
dust
beheld
a
great
blade
whose
point
pricked
his
naked
throat
and
beyond
this
blade
a
face
pallid
fierce
from
whose
blazing
eyes
death
glared
down
at
him
dog
panted
beltane
ha
cuthbert
roared
red
pertolepe
writhing
grinding
heel
to
me
cuthbert
to
me
but
as
the
esquire
wheeled
upon
beltane
with
sword
uplifted
out
from
the
green
an
arrow
whistled
and
cuthbert
swayed
in
his
saddle
and
thudded
to
earth
while
his
great
rearing
affrighted
plunged
among
the
and
all
was
shouting
and
confusion
while
from
amid
the
willows
arrows
whizzed
and
flew
whose
cruel
barbs
horses
snorted
stumbling
and
kicking
or
crashed
into
the
dust
and
ever
the
confusion
grew
but
now
sir
pertolepe
wriggling
beneath
beltane
iron
foot
had
unsheathed
his
dagger
yet
ere
he
could
stab
down
upon
his
red
pate
crashed
the
heavy
pommel
of
beltane
sword
and
sir
pertolepe
sinking
backward
lay
in
the
dust
very
silent
and
very
still
then
beltane
sheathed
his
sword
and
stooping
caught
sir
pertolepe
by
the
belt
and
dragged
him
into
the
shade
of
the
willows
and
being
come
to
the
stream
threw
his
captive
down
thereby
and
fell
to
splashing
his
bruised
face
with
the
cool
water
and
now
above
the
shouts
and
the
trampling
of
hoofs
upon
the
road
came
the
clash
of
steel
on
steel
and
the
harsh
roar
of
walkyn
and
black
roger
as
they
plied
axe
and
sword
arise
ha
arise
then
as
beltane
glanced
up
the
leaves
near
by
were
dashed
aside
and
giles
came
bounding
through
his
gay
feather
shorn
away
his
escalloped
cape
wrenched
and
torn
his
broadsword
in
his
hand
ho
tall
brother
a
sweet
affray
he
panted
the
fools
give
back
already
they
cry
that
pertolepe
is
slain
and
the
woods
full
of
outlaws
they
be
falling
back
from
the
village
had
i
but
a
few
shafts
in
my
quiver
now
but
here
beholding
the
face
of
beltane
captive
giles
let
fall
his
sword
staring
holy
st
giles
he
gasped
is
the
red
pertolepe
and
so
stood
agape
what
time
a
trumpet
brayed
a
fitful
blast
from
the
road
and
was
answered
afar
thereafter
came
roger
stooping
as
he
ran
and
shouting
archers
archers
run
lord
but
beltane
stirred
not
only
he
dashed
the
water
in
sir
twitching
face
wherefore
came
roger
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
pleading
master
o
master
he
panted
the
forest
is
with
lances
and
there
be
archers
also
let
us
make
the
woods
ere
we
are
beset
but
beltane
seeing
the
captive
stir
shook
off
black
roger
grasp
but
now
one
laughed
and
walkyn
towered
above
him
white
teeth
agleam
who
staring
down
at
sir
pertolepe
whirled
up
his
bloody
axe
to
smite
fool
cried
beltane
and
threw
up
his
hand
to
stay
the
blow
and
in
that
moment
sir
pertolepe
oped
his
eyes
is
pertolepe
panted
walkyn
is
he
that
slew
wife
and
child
so
now
will
i
slay
him
since
we
in
this
hour
must
die
not
so
quoth
beltane
stand
back
obey
me
back
i
say
so
muttering
walkyn
lowered
his
axe
while
beltane
drawing
his
dagger
stooped
above
sir
pertolepe
and
spake
swift
and
low
in
his
ear
and
with
dagger
at
his
throat
and
in
a
while
beltane
rose
and
sir
pertolepe
also
and
side
by
side
they
stepped
forth
of
the
leaves
out
into
the
road
where
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
pikemen
and
archer
and
knight
were
halted
in
a
surging
throng
while
above
the
jostling
confusion
rose
the
hoarse
babel
of
their
voices
but
of
a
sudden
the
clamour
died
to
silence
and
thereafter
from
a
hundred
throats
a
shout
went
up
a
pertolepe
is
sir
pertolepe
now
in
this
moment
beltane
laid
his
about
sir
broad
shoulders
and
set
the
point
of
his
dagger
sir
right
ear
speak
quoth
beltane
softly
and
his
bit
deeper
speak
now
as
i
commanded
thee
a
while
sir
pertolepe
bit
savagely
at
his
then
lifting
his
head
spake
that
all
might
hear
ho
sirs
he
cried
i
am
fain
to
bide
awhile
and
hold
talk
with
one
beltane
who
styleth
himself
duke
of
pentavalon
hie
ye
back
therefore
one
and
all
and
wait
me
in
garthlaxton
yet
an
i
come
not
by
sunset
ride
forth
and
seek
me
within
the
forest
go
hereupon
from
the
disordered
ranks
a
sound
arose
a
hoarse
murmur
that
voiced
their
stark
amaze
and
for
a
while
all
eyes
stared
upon
those
two
grim
figures
that
yet
stood
so
close
and
brotherly
but
sir
pertolepe
quelled
them
with
a
gesture
go
he
commanded
so
their
disarray
fell
into
rank
and
order
and
wheeling
about
they
marched
away
along
the
forest
road
with
helm
agleam
and
pennons
the
while
sir
pertolepe
stared
after
them
wild
of
eye
and
with
mailed
hands
clenched
once
he
made
as
if
to
call
them
back
but
beltane
hand
was
heavy
on
his
shoulder
and
the
dagger
pricked
his
throat
and
thus
stood
they
side
by
side
until
the
tramp
of
feet
was
died
away
until
the
last
trembling
villager
had
slunk
from
sight
and
the
broad
road
was
deserted
all
save
for
cuthbert
the
esquire
and
divers
horses
that
lay
stiffly
in
the
dust
silent
and
very
still
then
beltane
sighed
and
sheathed
his
dagger
and
sir
pertolepe
faced
him
scrowling
and
arrogant
ha
outlaw
quoth
he
give
back
my
sword
and
i
will
cope
with
thee
wolf
head
though
thou
art
aye
and
any
two
other
rogues
beside
nay
answered
beltane
i
fight
with
such
as
thee
but
when
i
needs
must
what
roger
he
called
go
fetch
hither
a
rope
dog
would
ye
murder
me
not
so
sighed
beltane
shaking
his
head
have
i
not
promised
to
leave
thee
alive
within
the
greenwood
yet
i
would
see
thee
walk
in
bonds
first
ha
dare
ye
bind
me
then
he
that
toucheth
me
toucheth
duke
ivo
dare
ye
so
do
rogue
aye
messire
nodded
beltane
i
dare
so
bring
hither
the
rope
roger
but
when
roger
was
come
nigh
sir
pertolepe
turned
and
stared
upon
him
what
cried
he
jovial
of
voice
yet
is
it
my
runaway
hangman
in
very
sooth
did
i
not
pay
thee
enough
thou
knave
did
i
not
love
thee
for
thy
skill
with
the
noose
thou
traitorous
rogue
now
mark
me
roger
one
day
will
i
feed
thee
to
my
hounds
and
watch
them
tear
thee
as
they
have
certain
other
rogues
aha
you
mind
them
belike
pale
of
cheek
and
with
trembling
hands
roger
bound
the
arms
of
him
that
had
been
his
while
walkyn
and
giles
silent
and
watched
it
done
whither
would
ye
take
me
quoth
red
pertolepe
arrogant
that
shalt
thou
know
anon
messire
how
an
i
defy
thee
then
must
we
carry
thee
messire
answered
beltane
yet
thine
own
legs
were
better
methinks
come
let
us
begone
thus
presently
having
forded
the
brook
they
struck
into
the
forest
first
went
walkyn
axe
on
shoulder
teeth
agleam
next
strode
sir
pertolepe
head
high
roger
and
silent
beltane
while
the
bowman
followed
after
calling
upon
giles
beneath
his
breath
and
crossing
himself
and
ever
and
anon
walkyn
would
turn
to
look
upon
their
scowling
captive
with
eyes
that
glared
shaggy
brows
now
after
they
had
gone
some
while
sir
pertolepe
brake
silence
and
spake
my
beltane
proud
and
fierce
fellow
quoth
he
if
is
for
ransom
ye
hold
me
summon
hither
thy
rogues
company
and
i
will
covenant
for
my
release
i
seek
no
ransom
of
thee
messire
answered
beltane
and
for
my
company
is
here
here
i
see
but
three
sorry
knaves
yet
with
these
same
three
did
i
thy
foresters
sir
pertolepe
rogue
thou
liest
is
thing
impossible
moreover
with
these
three
did
i
last
night
burn
down
black
mighty
gallows
that
stood
without
belsaye
town
and
thereafter
set
wide
the
dungeon
of
belsaye
and
delivered
thence
certain
woeful
prisoners
and
sent
them
abroad
with
word
that
i
beltane
son
of
beltane
the
strong
duke
of
pentavalon
am
come
at
last
bearing
the
sword
of
my
father
that
was
wont
to
strike
deep
for
liberty
and
justice
nor
having
life
will
i
lay
it
by
until
oppression
is
no
more
now
indeed
did
sir
pertolepe
stare
upon
my
beltane
in
amaze
and
spake
no
word
for
wonder
then
of
a
sudden
he
laughed
scornful
and
loud
ho
thou
burner
of
gibbets
quoth
he
take
heed
lest
thy
windy
boasting
bring
thy
lordly
neck
within
a
noose
art
lusty
of
arm
yet
lustier
of
tongue
and
as
to
thy
father
he
be
messire
beltane
voice
was
soft
yet
meeting
the
calm
serenity
of
his
gaze
sir
pertolepe
checked
the
jeer
upon
his
lip
and
stared
upon
beltane
as
one
beheld
in
turn
his
high
and
noble
look
the
costly
excellence
of
his
armour
his
great
sword
and
belt
of
silver
and
strode
on
thereafter
with
never
a
word
yet
viewing
beltane
aslance
brows
in
dark
perplexity
so
at
last
they
came
into
a
little
clearing
among
the
denser
green
beltane
paused
here
and
lifting
mailed
hand
pointed
to
a
certain
tree
but
hereupon
sir
pertolepe
staring
round
about
him
and
down
upon
his
galling
bonds
spake
sir
knight
said
he
who
thou
art
i
know
not
yet
if
indeed
thou
art
of
gentle
blood
then
know
that
i
am
sir
pertolepe
baron
of
trenda
seneschal
of
garthlaxton
lord
warden
of
the
marches
moreover
friend
and
am
i
to
duke
ivo
nay
said
beltane
all
this
i
know
for
much
of
thee
have
i
heard
messire
of
thy
dark
doings
of
the
agony
of
men
the
shame
of
women
and
how
that
there
be
many
desolate
hearths
and
nameless
graves
of
thy
making
lord
pertolepe
thou
wert
indeed
of
an
high
estate
and
strong
and
these
but
lowly
folk
and
weak
yet
mercy
on
them
had
ye
none
i
have
this
day
heard
thee
doom
the
innocent
to
death
and
bitter
shame
and
lord
as
god
seeth
us
it
is
enough
sir
pertolepe
ruddy
cheek
showed
pale
but
his
blue
eyes
stared
upon
beltane
wide
and
fearless
have
ye
then
dragged
me
hither
to
die
messire
lord
pertolepe
all
men
must
die
aye
great
lords
such
as
thou
when
they
have
sinned
sufficiently
and
thy
sins
methinks
do
reach
high
heaven
so
have
i
brought
thee
hither
into
the
wilderness
that
god
will
may
be
wrought
upon
thee
how
wilt
forswear
thyself
cried
sir
pertolepe
writhing
in
his
bonds
quoth
beltane
come
roger
walkyn
bring
me
him
to
the
tree
yonder
ha
rogue
rogue
panted
sir
pertolepe
leave
me
to
die
in
a
noose
unshriven
and
unannealed
my
soul
dragged
weighted
with
my
sins
now
even
as
he
spake
swift
and
sudden
he
leapt
aside
and
would
have
fled
but
walkyn
fierce
fingers
dragged
at
his
throat
and
iron
arms
were
close
about
him
desperately
he
fought
and
struggled
but
mighty
though
he
was
his
captors
were
mighty
also
moreover
his
bonds
galled
him
wherefore
fighting
yet
they
dragged
him
to
the
tree
and
to
the
tree
beltane
fast
bound
him
whiles
the
forest
rang
and
echoed
with
his
panting
cries
until
his
great
voice
cracked
and
broke
and
he
hung
the
tree
spent
and
breathless
then
spake
beltane
yet
soft
of
voice
lord
pertolepe
fain
would
i
hang
thee
as
thou
hast
hanged
many
a
man
ere
now
but
this
methinks
is
a
better
way
for
here
unless
some
wanderer
chance
to
find
thee
must
thou
perish
an
so
god
will
it
thus
do
we
leave
thee
in
the
hands
of
god
to
grant
thee
life
or
death
and
may
he
have
mercy
on
thy
guilty
soul
thus
said
beltane
sombre
of
brow
and
pale
of
cheek
and
so
beckoning
to
the
others
turned
away
despite
sir
pertolepe
passionate
threats
and
prayers
and
plunging
into
the
dense
underbrush
strode
from
the
place
with
the
captive
wild
cries
ringing
in
his
ears
haphazard
went
beltane
yet
straining
his
ears
to
catch
those
mournful
sounds
that
grew
faint
and
fainter
with
distance
till
they
were
lost
in
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
but
of
a
sudden
he
stayed
his
going
and
stood
with
his
head
aslant
hearkening
to
a
sound
that
seemed
to
have
reached
him
from
the
solitudes
behind
and
presently
it
came
again
a
cry
from
afar
a
scream
of
agony
hoarse
and
long
drawn
out
a
hateful
sound
that
checked
the
breath
of
him
and
brought
the
sweat
out
cold
upon
his
brow
and
now
turning
about
he
saw
that
his
following
was
but
two
for
walkyn
had
vanished
quite
now
giles
meeting
wide
stare
must
needs
cough
and
fumble
with
his
bow
whiles
roger
stood
with
bowed
head
and
fingers
upon
his
whereat
beltane
spake
wait
he
commanded
wait
you
here
and
forthwith
turned
and
ran
and
so
running
came
again
at
last
to
that
obscure
glade
whence
now
came
a
sound
of
groans
mocked
thereafter
by
fierce
laughter
now
bursting
from
the
green
beltane
beheld
sir
pertolepe
writhing
in
his
bonds
with
walkyn
fierce
fingers
twined
in
his
red
hair
and
busy
dagger
at
his
upturned
brow
where
was
a
great
gory
wound
a
hideous
cruciform
blotch
whence
pulsed
the
blood
that
covered
his
writhen
face
like
a
scarlet
vizard
ah
cried
beltane
what
hast
thou
done
back
fell
walkyn
and
grim
yet
with
teeth
agleam
through
the
hair
of
his
beard
lord
quoth
he
this
man
hath
slain
wife
and
child
and
brother
so
do
i
know
him
thrice
a
murderer
therefore
have
i
set
this
mark
of
cain
upon
him
that
all
men
henceforth
may
see
and
know
but
now
an
it
be
so
thy
will
take
this
my
dagger
and
slay
me
here
and
now
yet
shall
red
pertolepe
bear
my
mark
upon
him
when
i
am
dead
awhile
stood
beltane
in
frowning
thought
then
pointed
to
the
green
go
said
he
the
others
wait
thee
so
walkyn
obeying
turned
and
plunged
into
the
green
while
beltane
followed
after
slow
and
but
now
even
as
he
went
slow
and
ever
slower
he
lifted
heavy
head
and
turned
about
for
above
the
leafy
stirrings
rose
the
mournful
lilting
of
a
pipe
clear
and
very
sweet
that
drew
nearer
and
louder
until
it
was
of
a
sudden
drowned
in
a
cry
hoarse
and
woeful
then
beltane
hasting
back
stood
to
peer
through
the
leaves
and
presently
his
flaunting
his
silver
bells
there
stepped
a
mountebank
into
the
clearing
that
same
jester
with
whom
beltane
had
talked
aforetime
beda
cried
sir
pertolepe
faintly
his
bloody
face
uplifted
and
is
it
forsooth
thou
beda
come
free
me
of
my
bonds
ha
why
stay
ye
i
am
pertolepe
thy
lord
know
you
me
not
beda
aye
full
well
i
know
thee
lord
pertolepe
thou
art
he
who
had
me
driven
forth
with
blows
and
bitter
stripes
thou
art
he
who
slew
my
father
for
an
jest
oho
well
do
i
know
thee
my
lord
pertolepe
so
saying
beda
the
jester
set
his
pipe
within
his
girdle
and
drawing
his
dagger
began
to
creep
upon
sir
pertolepe
who
shook
the
dripping
blood
from
his
eyes
to
watch
him
as
he
came
quote
he
art
a
good
fool
beda
aye
a
good
fool
and
for
thy
father
was
the
wine
beda
the
wine
not
i
come
free
me
of
these
my
bonds
i
loved
thy
father
as
i
loved
thee
yet
is
my
father
dead
lord
and
i
am
outcast
said
beda
smiling
and
fingering
his
dagger
so
then
will
ye
slay
me
beda
wilt
murder
thy
lord
why
then
strike
fool
strike
here
i
the
throat
and
let
thy
steel
be
come
then
sir
pertolepe
feebly
raised
his
bloody
head
proffering
his
throat
to
the
steel
and
so
stood
faint
in
his
bonds
yet
watching
the
jester
slowly
slowly
the
dagger
was
lifted
for
the
stroke
while
sir
pertolepe
watched
the
glittering
steel
patient
and
unflinching
then
swift
and
sudden
the
dagger
flashed
and
fell
and
sir
pertolepe
staggered
free
and
so
stood
swaying
then
looking
down
upon
his
severed
bonds
he
laughed
hoarsely
how
was
but
a
jest
then
my
beda
he
whispered
a
jest
ha
and
methinks
forsooth
the
best
wilt
ever
make
so
saying
sir
pertolepe
stumbled
forward
a
pace
groping
before
him
like
a
blind
man
then
groaning
fell
and
lay
his
bloody
face
hidden
in
the
grass
and
turning
away
beltane
left
him
lying
there
with
beda
the
jester
kneeling
above
him
chapter
xvi
of
the
rueful
knight
of
the
burning
heart
southward
marched
beltane
hour
after
hour
tireless
of
stride
until
the
sun
began
to
decline
on
and
on
thoughtful
of
brow
and
speaking
not
at
all
wherefore
the
three
were
gloomy
and
silent
also
even
giles
had
no
mind
to
break
in
upon
his
solemn
meditations
but
at
last
came
roger
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
master
said
he
the
day
groweth
to
a
close
and
we
famish
why
then
eat
said
beltane
now
while
they
set
about
building
a
fire
beltane
went
aside
and
wandering
slow
and
thoughtful
presently
came
to
a
broad
glade
or
ride
and
stretching
himself
out
a
tree
lay
there
staring
up
at
the
leafy
canopy
pondering
upon
sir
pertolepe
his
sins
and
the
marvellous
ways
of
god
lying
thus
he
was
aware
of
the
slow
plodding
of
a
horse
drawing
near
of
the
twang
of
a
lute
with
a
voice
sweet
and
melodious
intoning
a
chant
and
the
tune
was
plaintive
and
the
words
likewise
being
these
alack
and
woe
that
love
is
so
akin
to
pain
that
to
my
heart
the
bitter
smart
returns
again
alack
and
woe
glancing
up
therefore
beltane
presently
espied
a
knight
who
bestrode
a
great
and
goodly
a
youthful
knight
and
debonair
slender
and
shapely
in
his
bright
mail
and
surcoat
of
samite
his
broad
shield
hung
behind
his
shoulder
balanced
by
a
long
lance
whose
gay
banderol
fluttered
wanton
to
the
air
above
his
he
wore
a
small
bascinet
while
at
his
his
ponderous
swung
together
with
now
as
he
paced
along
in
this
right
gallant
estate
his
roving
glance
by
hap
lighted
on
beltane
whereupon
checking
his
powerful
horse
he
plucked
daintily
at
the
strings
of
his
lute
and
brake
into
song
anew
ah
woe
is
me
that
i
should
be
a
lonely
wight
that
in
mankind
no
joy
i
find
by
day
or
night
ah
woe
is
me
thereafter
he
sighed
amain
and
smote
his
bosom
and
smiling
upon
beltane
spake
most
excellent
tall
and
sweet
young
sir
i
who
love
lorn
pilgrim
am
do
give
thee
woeful
greeting
and
entreat
now
the
courtesy
of
thy
pity
and
wherefore
pity
sir
quoth
beltane
sitting
up
for
reason
of
a
lady
silver
laughter
a
notable
reason
this
for
mark
me
ye
lovers
an
thy
lady
flout
thee
one
hour
grieve
not
she
shall
be
kind
the
next
an
she
scorn
thee
despair
nothing
she
shall
love
thee
but
an
she
laugh
and
laugh
ah
then
poor
lover
venus
pity
thee
then
languish
hope
and
tender
heart
be
rent
for
love
and
laughter
can
be
kin
wherefore
a
woeful
wight
am
i
foredone
and
all
distraught
for
love
behold
here
the
blazon
on
my
shield
lo
a
riven
heart
proper
direfully
aflame
upon
a
field
vert
the
heart
methinks
is
aptly
wrought
and
popped
and
the
flame
in
sooth
here
beneath
behold
my
motto
which
signifieth
burn
other
device
have
i
laid
by
for
the
nonce
what
time
my
pilgrimage
shall
be
accompt
but
beltane
looked
not
so
much
upon
the
shield
as
on
the
face
of
him
that
bore
it
and
beholding
its
high
and
fearless
look
the
clear
bright
eyes
and
humorous
mouth
albeit
schooled
to
melancholy
he
smiled
and
got
him
to
his
feet
now
well
met
sir
knight
of
the
burning
heart
quoth
he
what
would
ye
here
alone
within
these
solitudes
sigh
messire
i
sing
and
sigh
and
sigh
and
sing
is
a
something
empty
life
methinks
not
so
messire
sighed
the
rueful
knight
for
when
i
chance
to
meet
a
gentle
youth
young
and
well
beseen
as
thou
bedight
in
goodly
mail
as
thou
with
knightly
sword
on
thigh
why
then
messire
is
ever
my
wont
to
declare
unto
him
that
she
i
honour
is
fairer
nobler
and
altogether
more
worthy
and
virtuous
than
any
other
she
soever
and
to
maintain
that
same
against
him
on
horse
or
afoot
with
lance
or
sword
thus
see
you
messire
even
a
lover
hath
betimes
his
compensations
and
the
sward
is
soft
underfoot
and
level
saying
which
the
knight
cocked
a
delicate
eyebrow
in
questioning
fashion
and
laid
a
slender
finger
to
the
pommel
of
his
long
sword
how
cried
beltane
fight
with
me
right
gladly
would
i
messire
to
break
the
monotony
i
had
rather
hear
thy
song
again
ha
liked
you
it
in
sooth
is
small
thing
of
mine
own
and
is
brief
nodded
beltane
brief
quoth
the
knight
brief
not
so
most
notable
youthful
sir
for
even
as
love
is
long
enduring
so
is
my
song
it
being
of
an
hundred
and
seventy
and
eight
cantos
in
all
dealing
somewhat
of
the
woes
and
ills
of
a
heart
sore
smitten
which
heart
is
mine
own
also
within
my
song
is
much
matter
of
hearts
in
truth
and
darts
of
flames
and
shames
of
yearnings
and
burnings
the
which
this
poor
heart
must
needs
endure
since
it
doth
constant
bleed
and
burn
indeed
messire
i
marvel
that
you
be
yet
alive
said
beltane
gravely
whereat
the
young
knight
did
pause
to
view
him
quoth
he
in
sooth
most
youthful
and
excellent
sir
i
have
myself
marvelled
thereat
betimes
but
since
alive
am
i
now
do
i
declare
unto
you
that
she
for
whom
i
sigh
is
the
fairest
gentlest
noblest
most
glorious
and
most
womanly
of
all
women
in
the
world
alive
save
one
said
beltane
save
none
messire
said
the
young
knight
one
said
beltane
none
quoth
the
knight
as
casting
aside
ponderous
lance
he
vaulted
lightly
from
his
saddle
and
drew
his
sword
but
seeing
that
beltane
bore
no
shield
paused
to
lay
his
own
tenderly
aside
and
so
faced
him
serene
of
brow
and
smiling
of
lip
sweet
sir
said
he
gaily
here
methinks
is
fair
cause
for
argument
let
us
then
discuss
the
matter
together
for
the
comfort
of
our
souls
and
to
the
glory
of
our
ladies
as
to
my
name
is
jocelyn
quoth
beltane
ha
exclaimed
the
knight
staring
that
won
a
suit
of
triple
mail
at
dunismere
joust
and
wagered
it
black
ivo
roan
stallion
within
deepwold
forest
upon
a
time
now
by
venus
cried
the
knight
starting
back
here
be
manifest
sorcery
ha
by
the
sweet
blind
boy
is
black
magic
and
he
crossed
himself
devoutly
but
beltane
laughing
put
back
his
hood
of
mail
that
his
long
fair
hair
fell
rippling
to
his
shoulders
know
you
me
not
messire
quoth
he
why
said
sir
jocelyn
knitting
delicate
brows
surely
thou
art
the
forester
that
duke
ivo
wrestler
aye
by
the
silver
feet
of
lovely
thetis
beltane
the
smith
verily
messire
nodded
beltane
and
is
not
meet
that
knight
cross
blade
with
lowly
smith
ha
quoth
sir
jocelyn
rubbing
at
his
smooth
white
chin
yet
art
a
goodly
man
withal
and
lover
to
boot
methinks
aye
sighed
beltane
ever
and
always
why
then
all
well
quoth
sir
jocelyn
with
eyes
for
since
true
love
knoweth
nought
of
distinctions
therefore
being
lovers
are
we
peers
and
being
peers
so
may
we
fight
together
so
come
sir
smith
here
stand
i
sword
in
hand
to
maintain
thee
and
all
men
the
fame
and
honour
of
her
i
worship
of
all
women
alive
maid
or
wife
or
widow
the
fairest
noblest
truest
and
most
is
helen
of
mortain
quoth
beltane
sighing
helen
helen
thou
too
exclaimed
sir
jocelyn
and
forthwith
dropped
his
sword
staring
in
stark
amaze
how
dost
thou
love
her
also
aye
sighed
beltane
to
my
sorrow
then
stooped
sir
jocelyn
and
taking
up
his
sword
slowly
sheathed
it
quoth
he
life
methinks
is
full
of
disappointments
farewell
to
thee
sir
smith
and
sighing
he
turned
away
yet
ere
he
had
taken
lance
and
shield
beltane
spake
whither
away
sir
jocelyn
to
sigh
and
sing
and
seek
adventure
was
for
this
i
left
my
goodly
castle
of
alain
and
journeyed
a
lorn
pilgrim
hither
to
pentavalon
since
when
strange
stories
have
i
heard
that
whisper
in
the
air
speeding
from
lip
to
lip
of
a
certain
doughty
valiant
beyond
thought
that
beareth
a
sword
whose
mighty
sweep
none
may
abide
who
alone
and
unaided
slew
an
hundred
and
twenty
and
four
within
the
greenwood
and
thereafter
did
the
walls
of
belsaye
town
burn
down
duke
ivo
gibbet
who
hath
sworn
to
cut
duke
ivo
into
gobbets
look
you
and
feed
him
to
the
dogs
which
is
well
for
i
love
not
duke
ivo
all
this
have
i
heard
and
much
beside
idle
tales
mayhap
yet
would
i
seek
out
this
errant
mars
and
prove
him
for
mine
own
behoof
with
stroke
of
sword
and
how
an
he
prove
worthy
questioned
beltane
then
will
i
ride
with
him
to
share
his
deeds
and
glory
mayhap
sir
smith
i
and
all
the
lusty
fellows
that
muster
to
my
pennon
since
in
the
air
is
whispered
talk
of
war
and
sir
benedict
lieth
ready
in
thrasfordham
keep
two
hundred
men
quoth
beltane
his
blue
eyes
agleam
two
hundred
say
you
and
speaking
he
stepped
forward
unsheathing
his
sword
how
now
quoth
sir
jocelyn
what
would
ye
sweet
smith
i
would
have
thee
prove
me
for
thy
behoof
sir
jocelyn
for
i
am
he
that
with
aid
of
five
good
men
burned
down
the
gibbet
without
belsaye
thou
cried
sir
jocelyn
and
thou
art
a
smith
and
yet
needs
must
i
credit
thee
for
thine
eyes
be
truthful
eyes
and
indeed
slay
so
many
in
the
green
forsooth
nay
answered
beltane
there
were
but
twenty
moreover
i
enough
cried
sir
jocelyn
gaily
be
thou
smith
or
be
thou
now
will
i
make
proof
of
thy
might
and
valiance
and
he
drew
sword
so
did
these
two
youths
face
each
other
smiling
above
their
gleaming
steel
and
so
the
long
blades
rang
together
and
thereafter
the
air
was
full
of
a
clashing
din
in
so
much
that
roger
came
running
sword
in
hand
with
walkyn
and
giles
at
his
heels
but
seeing
how
matters
stood
they
sat
them
down
on
the
sward
watching
and
eager
and
now
sir
jocelyn
his
doleful
heart
forgot
did
show
himself
a
doughty
knight
skipping
lightly
to
and
fro
despite
his
heavy
armour
and
laying
on
right
lustily
while
the
three
upon
the
grass
shouted
gleefully
at
each
shrewd
stroke
or
skilful
parry
but
once
sir
jocelyn
blade
clashed
upon
beltane
mailed
thigh
and
straightway
they
fell
silent
and
once
his
point
touched
the
links
on
beltane
wide
breast
and
straightway
their
brows
grew
anxious
and
gloomy
yet
none
so
gloomy
as
roger
but
now
on
a
sudden
was
the
flash
and
ring
of
hard
smitten
steel
and
behold
sir
jocelyn
sword
sprang
from
his
grasp
and
thudded
to
earth
a
good
three
yards
away
whereupon
the
three
roared
amain
yet
none
so
loud
as
roger
now
by
sweet
cupid

tender
bow
panted
sir
jocelyn
by
the
cestus

beltane
turned
and
looking
upon
the
mighty
three
with
kindling
eye
beckoned
them
near
lord
jocelyn
said
he

stammered
sir
jocelyn
in
blank
amaze

said
beltane

little
desperate
and
he
who

good
of
his
fellows

mad
sighed
sir
jocelyn
art
surely
mad
heigho
some
day
mayhap
it
shall
be
written
how
one
jocelyn
alain
a
gentle
knight
singing
his
woes
within
the
greenwood
did
meet
four
lovely
madmen
and
straight
fell
mad
likewise
so
here
upon
my
sword
do
i
swear
to
take
thee
for
my
and
these
thy
comrades
for
my
comrades
and
to
spend
my
life
henceforth
to
the
good
of
my
fellows
so
saying
sir
jocelyn
smiled
his
quick
bright
smile
and
reached
out
his
hand
to
my
beltane
and
there
leaning
upon
their
swords
their
mailed
fingers
clasped
and
wrung
each
other
thereafter
he
turned
upon
the
three
but
even
as
he
did
so
walkyn
uttered
a
fierce
cry
and
whirling
about
with
axe
aloft
sprang
into
the
green
whence
of
a
sudden
rose
a
babel
of
voices
and
the
sound
of
fierce
blows
and
thereafter
the
noise
of
pursuit
a
flicker
of
steel
amid
the
green
a
score
of
fierce
faces
all
about
him
and
beltane
was
seized
from
behind
borne
struggling
to
his
knees
to
his
face
battered
by
unseen
weapons
dragged
at
by
unseen
hands
choked
his
arms
twisted
and
bound
by
galling
thongs
now
as
he
lay
thus
helpless
a
mailed
foot
spurned
him
fiercely
and
looking
up
he
beheld
sir
pertolepe
smiling
down
at
him
ha
thou
fool
he
laughed
jovially
think
to
escape
me
then
thou
fool
i
have
followed
on
thy
tracks
all
day
by
the
eyes
of
god
i
would
have
followed
thee
to
hell
i
want
thee
in
garthlaxton
there
be
gibbets
for
thee
above
the
keep
also
there
are
my
hounds
aye
i
want
thee
messire
beltane
who
art
duke
of
pentavalon
ho
arnulf
a
halter
for
his
ducal
throat
so
when
they
had
cast
a
noose
about
his
neck
they
dragged
beltane
choking
to
his
feet
and
led
him
away
gasping
and
staggering
through
the
green
and
having
eyes
he
saw
not
and
having
ears
he
heard
not
being
very
spent
and
sick
now
as
they
went
evening
began
to
fall
chapter
xvii
of
the
ambushment
near
thornaby
mill
little
by
little
as
he
stumbled
along
beltane
brain
began
to
clear
he
became
aware
of
the
ring
and
clash
of
arms
about
him
and
the
trampling
of
horses
gradually
the
mist
lifting
he
saw
long
files
of
riding
along
very
orderly
with
archers
and
little
by
little
amid
all
these
hostile
forms
he
seemed
to
recognise
a
certain
pair
of
legs
that
went
on
just
before
sturdy
legs
that
yet
faltered
now
and
then
in
their
stride
and
looking
higher
he
saw
a
broad
belt
whose
edges
were
notched
and
and
a
wide
back
that
yet
bent
weakly
forward
with
every
shambling
step
once
this
figure
sank
to
its
knees
but
stumbled
up
again
the
vicious
prick
of
a
that
left
blood
upon
the
bronzed
skin
whereat
beltane
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
o
black
roger
he
groaned
i
grieve
to
have
brought
thee
to
this
nay
lord
quoth
roger
lifting
high
his
drooping
head
is
but
my
wound
that
bleeds
afresh
but
bond
or
free
thy
man
am
i
and
able
yet
to
strike
a
blow
on
thy
behalf
an
heaven
so
please
now
god
shield
thee
brave
roger
sighed
beltane
o
sweet
giles
and
what
of
me
brother
spake
a
voice
in
his
ear
and
turning
beltane
beheld
the
archer
smiling
upon
him
with
swollen
bloody
lips
thou
here
too
good
giles
even
so
tall
brother
in
adversity
lo
i
am
with
thee
since
i
found
no
chance
to
run
for
that
divers
rogues
constrained
me
to
abide
notably
yon
knave
with
the
scar
whose
mailed
fist
i
had
perforce
to
kiss
brother
in
whose
dog
carcase
i
will
yet
feather
me
a
shaft
sweet
giles
aiding
me
which
is
my
patron
saint
mind
brother
bruised
and
beaten
bleeding
and
in
bonds
yet
i
breathe
nothing
desponding
for
mark
me
brother
walkyn
and
the
young
knight
won
free
which
is
well
walkyn
hath
long
legs
which
is
better
walkyn
hath
many
friends
i
the
greenwood
which
is
best
of
all
so
do
i
keep
a
merry
heart
spiro
trusting
to
the
good
giles
which
as
methinks
you
know
is
my
the
archer
grew
suddenly
dumb
his
comely
face
blanched
and
glancing
round
beltane
beheld
sir
pertolepe
beside
him
who
leaned
down
from
his
great
white
horse
to
smile
and
smiling
thus
put
back
the
from
his
pallid
face
and
laid
a
finger
to
the
linen
clout
that
swathed
his
head
above
the
brows
messire
said
he
for
this
i
might
hang
thee
to
a
tree
or
drag
thee
at
a
horse
tail
or
hew
thee
in
sunder
with
this
great
sword
o
thine
which
shall
be
mine
henceforth
but
these
be
deaths
unworthy
of
such
as
thou
my
lord
duke
now
within
garthlaxton
be
divers
ways
and
means
quaint
fashions
and
devices
strange
and
rare
messire
and
when
i
done
black
roger
shall
hang
what
left
of
thee
ere
he
go
to
feed
my
hounds
that
big
body
o
thine
shall
rot
above
my
gate
and
for
that
golden
head
ha
i
send
it
to
duke
ivo
in
quittance
for
his
gallows
yet
first
o
first
shalt
thou
sigh
that
death
must
needs
be
so
long
but
now
from
where
the
marched
came
galloping
a
tall
esquire
who
reining
in
beside
sir
pertolepe
pointed
down
the
hill
lord
pertolepe
he
cried
joyously
yonder
scarce
a
mile
flies
the
banner
of
gilles
of
brandonmere
his
company
few
his
men
scattered
and
heavy
with
plunder
gilles
quoth
sir
pertolepe
ha
is
it
forsooth
gilles
of
brandonmere
himself
lord
and
none
other
i
marked
plain
his
banner
with
the
three
stooping
falcons
and
he
hath
booty
say
you
in
truth
my
lord
and
there
be
women
also
three
horse
litters
ah
women
verily
good
fulk
hast
ever
a
quick
eye
for
the
flutter
of
a
kirtle
now
mark
me
fulk
thornaby
mill
lieth
in
our
front
and
beyond
the
road
windeth
steep
high
banks
let
archers
line
these
banks
east
and
west
let
the
pikemen
be
ambushed
to
the
south
until
we
from
the
north
have
charged
them
with
the
horse
see
is
done
fulk
and
silently
so
peradventure
sir
gilles
shall
trouble
me
no
more
pass
the
word
away
off
rode
sir
fulk
and
straightway
the
pounding
hoofs
were
still
the
jingle
of
bridle
and
stirrup
hushed
and
in
its
place
a
vague
stir
of
bustle
and
excitement
of
pikemen
wheeling
right
and
left
to
vanish
southwards
into
the
green
and
of
archers
stringing
bows
and
unbuckling
ere
they
too
wheeled
and
vanished
yet
now
sir
pertolepe
stayed
four
lusty
fellows
and
beckoning
them
near
pointed
to
the
prisoners
good
fellows
quoth
he
nodding
jovially
upon
the
archers
here
be
my
three
rogues
see
you
who
must
with
me
to
garthlaxton
one
to
die
by
slow
fire
one
to
be
torn
by
my
hounds
and
one
this
tall
youth
mark
him
well
to
die
in
slow
and
subtle
fashion
now
these
three
do
i
put
in
charge
of
ye
trusty
four
guard
them
well
good
fellows
for
an
one
escape
so
shall
ye
all
four
die
in
his
stead
and
in
such
fashion
as
he
should
have
died
ha
d
mark
me
well
my
merry
men
aye
lord
nodded
the
four
scowling
of
brow
yet
look
to
it
i
find
them
secure
therefore
and
entreat
them
tenderly
march
you
at
the
rear
and
see
they
take
no
harm
choose
ye
some
secure
corner
where
they
may
lie
safe
from
chance
of
stray
shafts
for
i
would
have
them
come
hale
and
sound
to
garthlaxton
since
to
die
well
a
man
must
be
strong
and
hearty
look
you
d
mark
me
well
good
fellows
aye
lord
growled
the
four
then
sir
pertolepe
fondling
his
great
chin
smiled
upon
beltane
and
lifted
beltane
glittering
sword
on
high
advance
my
banner
he
cried
and
rode
forward
among
his
on
went
the
company
grimly
silent
now
save
for
the
snort
of
a
horse
the
champing
of
curbing
bits
and
the
thud
of
slow
trampling
hoofs
upon
the
tender
grass
as
the
west
flamed
to
sunset
thus
in
a
while
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
narrowing
ran
high
banks
clothed
in
gorse
and
underbrush
a
shadowy
road
the
which
winding
downwards
was
lost
in
a
sharp
curve
here
the
array
was
halted
and
abode
very
still
and
silent
with
helm
and
winking
in
the
last
red
rays
of
sunset
o
brother
whispered
giles
saw
i
place
sweeter
or
more
apt
for
ambushment
here
shall
be
bloody
doings
anon
and
we
helpless
as
babes
o
me
the
pity
o
but
now
with
blows
and
gibes
the
four
archers
dragged
them
unto
a
tall
tree
that
stood
beside
the
way
a
tree
of
mighty
girth
whose
branches
cast
a
deep
gloom
within
this
gloom
lay
my
beltane
stirring
not
and
speaking
no
word
being
faint
and
sick
with
his
hurts
but
giles
the
archer
sitting
beside
him
vented
by
turns
bitter
curses
upon
sir
pertolepe
and
humble
prayers
to
his
patron
saint
so
fluent
and
so
fast
that
prayers
and
curses
became
strangely
blent
and
mingled
on
this
wise
may
red
pertolepe
be
thrice
damned
with
a
candle
to
the
blessed
saint
giles
that
is
my
comfort
and
intercessor
may
his
bones
rot
within
him
with
my
gold
chain
to
sweet
saint
giles
may
his
tongue
wither
at
the
roots
ah
good
saint
giles
save
me
from
the
fire
may
he
be
cursed
in
life
and
may
the
flesh
shrivel
on
his
bones
and
his
soul
be
eternally
damned
with
another
candle
and
fifty
gold
pieces
to
the
altar
of
holy
saint
giles
but
now
hearing
roger
groan
the
archer
paused
to
admonish
him
thus
croak
not
roger
croak
not
quoth
he
think
not
upon
thy
vile
body
pray
man
pray
pray
thyself
speechless
call
reverently
upon
the
blessed
saints
as
i
do
promise
them
candles
roger
promise
hard
and
pray
harder
lest
we
perish
i
by
fire
and
thou
by
pertolepe
hounds
ill
deaths
look
you
aye
is
a
cruel
death
to
be
burnt
alive
roger
to
be
torn
by
hounds
is
worse
growled
roger
nay
my
rogerkin
the
fire
is
slower
methinks
i
have
watched
good
flesh
sear
and
shrivel
ere
now
ha
by
saint
giles
is
an
evil
subject
let
us
rather
think
upon
two
others
as
what
archer
the
long
legs
of
our
comrade
walkyn
hist
hark
ye
to
that
bruit
here
cometh
gilles
of
brandonmere
meseemeth
and
now
from
the
road
in
front
rose
the
sound
of
an
approaching
company
the
tramp
of
weary
horses
climbing
the
ascent
with
the
sound
of
cheery
voices
upraised
in
song
and
ever
the
sinking
sun
glinted
redly
on
helm
and
where
sat
sir
pertolepe
mailed
riders
grim
and
silent
while
the
cheery
voices
swelled
near
and
more
near
till
all
at
once
the
song
died
to
a
hum
of
amaze
that
rose
to
a
warning
shout
that
was
drowned
in
the
blare
of
a
piercing
trumpet
blast
whereat
down
swept
glittering
forward
leaned
shining
bascinet
and
the
first
rank
of
sir
pertolepe
riders
striking
spurs
thundered
upon
them
down
the
hill
came
thereafter
the
shock
of
meeting
ranks
with
shouts
and
cries
that
grew
to
a
muffled
roar
up
rose
the
dust
an
eddying
cloud
wherein
steel
flickered
and
dim
forms
strove
horse
to
horse
and
man
to
man
while
sir
pertolepe
sitting
his
great
white
charger
nursed
his
big
chin
and
smiling
waited
his
chance
presently
from
the
eddying
cloud
staggered
the
broken
remnant
of
sir
gilles
whereon
laughing
fierce
and
loud
sir
pertolepe
rose
in
his
stirrups
with
beltane
long
sword
lifted
high
his
trumpets
brayed
the
charge
and
down
the
hill
thundered
sir
pertolepe
and
all
his
array
and
the
road
near
by
was
deserted
save
for
the
prisoners
and
the
four
archers
who
stood
together
their
faces
set
where
the
dust
rose
denser
and
denser
and
the
roar
of
the
conflict
fierce
and
loud
but
now
above
the
din
and
tumult
of
the
fight
below
shrill
and
high
rose
the
notes
of
a
horn
winded
from
the
woods
in
the
east
that
was
answered
like
an
echo
out
of
the
woods
in
the
west
and
down
the
banks
to
right
and
left
behold
sir
pertolepe
archers
came
leaping
and
tumbling
pursued
by
a
hissing
arrow
shower
whereat
up
sprang
giles
despite
his
bonds
shouting
amain
o
walkyn
o
the
long
legs
a
rescue
to
us
arise
i
will
arise
now
while
he
shouted
thus
came
one
of
the
four
archers
and
giles
was
smitten
to
his
knees
but
as
the
archer
whirled
up
his
to
strike
again
an
arrow
took
him
full
in
the
throat
and
pitching
upon
his
face
he
lay
awhile
coughing
in
the
dust
now
as
his
comrades
yet
stared
upon
this
man
so
suddenly
dead
down
from
the
bank
above
leapt
one
who
bore
a
glittering
axe
with
divers
wild
and
ragged
fellows
at
his
heels
came
a
sound
of
shouting
and
blows
hard
smitten
a
rush
of
feet
and
thereafter
silence
save
for
the
din
of
battle
afar
but
upon
the
silence
loud
and
sudden
rose
a
quavering
laugh
and
giles
spake
his
voice
yet
shrill
and
unsteady
was
walkyn
ha
saint
giles
bless
walkyn
long
legs
was
walkyn
i
saw
walkyn
hath
brought
down
the
outlaws

sir
pertolepe
slow
fire

not
roast
me
yet
awhile
nor
his
dogs

the
carcase
my
rogerkin
aye
quoth
roger
feebly
but
what
of
my
lord
see
how
still
he
lieth
forsooth
exclaimed
the
archer
writhing
in
his
bonds
to

upon
a
close
array

work

knew
where
walkyn
lay
here
comrade
said
a
voice
from
the
shade
of
the
great
tree
how

there
cried
the
archer

way
so

to
take

that
moment
with
this
mine
axe

said
i
not
so
hark
i
they
break
already
peace
now
wait
and
watch
so
saying
walkyn
crouched
behind
the
tree
axe
poised
what
time
the
dust
and
roar
of
battle
rolled
toward
them
up
the
hill
and
presently
from
out
the
rolling
cloud
riderless
horses
burst
and
thundered
past
and
after
them
a
staggering
rout
mounted
and
afoot
spurring
and
trampling
each
other
the
merciless
that
smote
them
from
the
banks
above
horse
and
foot
they
thundered
by
until
at
last
amid
a
ring
of
cowering
sir
pertolepe
galloped
his
white
horse
bespattered
with
blood
and
foam
his
battered
helm
upon
its
thongs
and
pale
he
rode
while
his
eyes
aflame
scowling
brows
swept
the
road
this
way
and
that
until
espying
beltane
the
tree
he
swerved
aside
in
his
career
and
strove
to
check
his
followers
headlong
flight
stay
cried
he
striking
right
and
left
halt
dogs
and
take
up
the
prisoners
ha
will
ye
defy
caitiffs
fulk
raoul
denis
ho
there
but
no
man
might
stay
that
maddened
rush
wherefore
swearing
a
great
oath
sir
pertolepe
spurred
upon
beltane
with
beltane
sword
lifted
for
the
blow
but
from
the
shade
of
the
tree
a
mighty
form
uprose
and
sir
pertolepe
was
aware
of
a
hoarse
glad
cry
saw
the
whirling
flash
of
a
broad
axe
and
wrenched
hard
at
his
bridle
round
staggered
the
white
horse
down
came
the
heavy
axe
and
the
great
horse
reared
up
and
up
back
and
back
and
crashing
over
was
lost
the
dust
of
hoofs
now
presently
beltane
was
aware
that
his
bonds
cramped
him
no
longer
found
roger
arm
about
him
and
at
his
parched
lips
roger
steel
brimming
with
cool
sweet
water
and
gulping
thirstily
soon
felt
the
numbness
lifted
from
his
brain
and
the
mist
from
his
eyes
in
so
much
that
he
sat
up
and
gazing
about
beheld
himself
alone
with
roger
quoth
he
looking
down
at
his
swollen
wrists
do
we
go
free
then
roger
aye
master
though
ye
had
a
woundy
knock
upon
the
head
and
what
of
giles
he
is
away
to
get
him
arrows
to
fill
his
quiver
and
to
fill
his
purse
with
what
he
may
for
the
dead
lie
thick
in
the
road
yonder
and
there
is
much
plunder
and
walkyn
walkyn
master
having
slain
sir
pertolepe
horse
yonder
followeth
pertolepe

straight
to

him
also
yet
dost
thou
remain
roger
aye
lord
and
here
is
that
which
thou
wilt
need
again
methinks
i
found
it
hard
by
sir
pertolepe
dead
horse
so
saying
roger
put
beltane
great
sword
into
his
hand
then
beltane
took
hold
upon
the
sword
and
rising
to
his
feet
stretched
wide
his
arms
and
felt
his
strength
renewed
within
him
therefore
he
sheathed
the
sword
and
set
his
hand
on
roger
broad
shoulder
roger
said
he
thou
faithful
roger
god
hath
delivered
us
from
shameful
death
wherefore
i
hold
he
hath
yet
need
of
these
our
bodies
as
how
master
as
i
went
nigh
swooning
in
my
bonds
methought
i
heard
tell
that
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
had
captive
certain
women
so
now
must
we
deliver
them

and
i
an
it
may
be
so
lord
quoth
roger
sir
gilles
marcheth
with
the
remnant
of
his
company
and
we
are
but
two
let
us
therefore
get
with
us
divers
of
these
outlaws
i
have
heard
tell
that
to
be
a
woman
and
captive
to
sir
gilles
or
pertolepe
the
red
is
to
be
brought
to
swift
and
dire
shame
so
now
let
us
deliver
these
women
from
shame
thou
and
wilt
go
with
me
roger
aye
lord
that
will
i
yet
first
pray
thee
aid
me
to
bind
a
clout
upon
my
arm
for
my
wound
irketh
me
somewhat
and
in
a
while
when
beltane
had
laved
and
bound
up
roger
wound
they
went
on
down
the
darkening
road
together
chapter
xviii
how
beltane
met
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
it
was
a
night
of
wind
with
a
flying
overhead
whence
peeped
the
pallid
moon
betimes
a
night
of
gloom
and
mystery
the
woods
about
them
were
full
of
sounds
and
stealthy
rustlings
as
they
strode
along
the
forest
road
and
so
came
to
that
dark
defile
where
the
fight
had
raged
of
what
they
saw
and
heard
within
that
place
of
slaughter
it
bodeth
not
to
tell
nor
of
those
figures
wild
and
fierce
that
crouched
to
strip
the
jumbled
slain
or
snarled
and
quarrelled
over
the
work
here
is
good
plunder
of
weapons
and
armour
quoth
roger
is
seldom
the
outlaws
come
by
such
hark
to
that
cry
there
died
some
wounded
wight
under
his
plunderer
knife
god
rest
his
soul
amen
sighed
beltane
come
let
us
hence
and
forthwith
he
began
to
run
so
in
a
little
while
they
passed
through
that
place
of
horror
unseen
and
so
came
out
again
upon
the
forest
road
ever
and
anon
the
moon
sent
down
a
feeble
ray
which
the
road
lay
the
gloom
of
the
woods
whence
came
groans
and
wailings
with
every
whereat
roger
quailed
and
fumbling
at
his
pressed
closer
upon
beltane
master
he
whispered
is
an
evil
night
methinks
the
souls
of
the
dead
be
abroad
hark
to
those
sounds
master
i
like
it
not
is
but
the
wind
roger
is
like
the
cries
of
women
wailing
their
dead
i
have
heard
such
sounds
ere
now
i
would
my
belt
bore
fewer
notches
master
they
shall
be
fewer
ere
dawn
roger
i
pray
god
master
an
i
am
slain
this
night
think
ye
i
must
burn
in
remembering
these
same
notches
nay
for
surely
god
is
a
very
merciful
god
roger
hark
quoth
beltane
and
stopped
of
a
sudden
and
thus
above
the
wailing
of
the
wind
they
presently
heard
a
feeble
groaning
hard
by
and
following
the
sound
beheld
a
blotch
upon
the
glimmering
road
now
as
they
drew
near
the
moon
peeped
out
and
showed
a
man
huddled
a
bush
beside
the
way
whose
face
gleamed
pale
amid
the
shadows
ha
cried
roger
stooping
of
brandonmere
aye
give
me
water
i
was
squire
to
sir
gilles
god
love
give
me
water
then
beltane
knelt
and
saw
this
was
but
a
youth
and
bidding
roger
bring
water
from
a
brook
near
by
took
the
heavy
head
upon
his
knee
messire
said
he
i
have
heard
that
sir
gilles
beareth
women
captive
there
is
but
one
and
she
a
nun
but
nuns
are
holy
women
so
i
withstood
my
lord
in
his
desire
and
my
lord
stabbed
me
so
must
i
die
of
a
nun
see
you
ah
give
me
water
where
doth
he
ride
this
night
messire
his
men
few
very
weary
sir
pertolepe
caught
us
the
sunken
road
sir
gilles
to
thornaby
mill
beside
the
ford
o
god
water
is
here
quoth
roger
kneeling
beside
him
then
beltane
set
the
water
to
the
squire
eager
lips
but
striving
to
drink
he
choked
and
choking
fell
back
dead
so
in
a
while
they
arose
from
their
knees
and
went
their
way
while
the
dead
youth
lay
with
wide
eyes
that
seemed
to
the
pallid
moon
now
as
they
went
on
very
silently
together
of
a
sudden
black
roger
caught
beltane
by
the
arm
and
pointed
into
the
gloom
where
far
before
them
small
lights
winked
redly
through
the
murk
yon
should
be
sir
gilles
he
whispered
aye
nodded
beltane
so
i
think
master
what
would
ye
now
pray
roger
i
pray
god
sir
gilles
men
be
few
and
that
they
be
sound
sleepers
howbeit
we
will
go
right
warily
none
the
less
so
saying
beltane
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
led
on
through
underbrush
and
thicket
through
a
gloom
of
leaves
where
a
boisterous
wind
rioted
where
great
branches
dim
seen
swayed
groaning
in
every
fierce
gust
and
all
was
piping
stir
and
tumult
twigs
whipped
them
viciously
thorns
dragged
at
them
while
the
wind
went
by
them
moaning
in
the
dark
but
ever
and
anon
as
they
stumbled
forward
guiding
themselves
by
instinct
the
moon
sent
forth
a
pale
beam
from
the
whirling
a
phantom
light
that
stole
upon
them
sudden
and
and
like
a
ghost
was
gone
again
what
time
black
roger
following
hard
on
beltane
heel
crossed
himself
and
muttered
fragments
of
forgotten
prayers
thus
at
last
they
came
to
the
river
that
flowed
before
them
vague
in
the
whose
sullen
waters
gurgled
evilly
among
the
willows
that
drooped
upon
the
marge
master
said
roger
wiping
sweat
from
his
face
there
evil
hereabouts
i
had
a
warning
a
dead
man
touched
me
as
we
came
through
the
brush
yonder
nay
roger
was
but
some
branch
lord
when
knew
ye
a
branch
with
fingers
slimy
and
cold
upon
my
cheek
here
was
a
warning
master
he
dead
hand
one
of
us
twain
goeth
to
his
death
this
night
let
not
thine
heart
fail
therefor
good
roger
man
being
dead
liveth
forever
nay
but
the
dead
hand
master
on
my
cheek
here
ah
crying
thus
black
roger
sprang
and
caught
beltane
arm
gripping
it
fast
for
on
the
air
borne
upon
the
wind
yet
louder
than
the
wind
a
shrill
sound
rang
and
echoed
the
which
passing
seemed
to
have
stricken
the
night
to
silence
then
beltane
brake
from
roger
clasp
and
ran
on
beside
the
river
until
beyond
the
sullen
waters
the
flared
before
him
in
whose
red
light
the
mill
loomed
up
rugged
and
grim
its
massy
walls
scarred
and
cracked
its
great
wheel
fallen
to
ruin
now
above
the
wheel
was
a
gap
in
the
masonry
an
opening
roughly
square
that
had
been
a
window
mayhap
whence
shone
a
warm
mellow
light
master
panted
roger
a
god
name
what
was
it
a
woman
screamed
quoth
beltane
staring
upon
the
lighted
window
as
he
spake
a
man
laughed
sleepily
beside
the
nearest
scarce
a
away
master
whispered
roger
we
may
not
cross
by
the
ford
because
of
the
is
a
fair
light
to
shoot
by
and
the
river
is
very
deep
hereabouts
yet
must
we
swim
it
roger
lord
the
water
is
in
flood
and
our
armour
heavy
then
must
we
leave
our
armour
behind
quoth
beltane
and
throwing
back
his
hood
of
mail
he
began
to
unbuckle
his
broad
belt
but
of
a
sudden
stayed
to
point
with
outstretched
finger
then
looking
whither
he
pointed
roger
saw
a
tree
whose
hole
leaned
far
out
across
the
stream
so
that
one
branch
well
nigh
scraped
the
broken
roof
of
the
mill
yon
lieth
our
way
roger
come
said
he
being
come
to
that
side
of
the
tree
afar
from
the
beltane
swung
himself
lightly
and
began
to
climb
but
hearing
a
groan
paused
roger
he
whispered
what
ails
thee
roger
alas
groaned
roger
is
my
wound
irketh
me
o
master
i
can
not
follow
thee
this
way
nay
let
me
aid
thee
whispered
beltane
reaching
down
to
him
but
despite
beltane
strong
hand
desperately
though
he
tried
black
roger
fell
back
groaning
master
he
pleaded
o
master
adventure
not
alone
lest
ill
befall
thee
aye
but
i
must
roger
then
roger
leaned
his
head
upon
his
sound
arm
and
wept
full
bitterly
o
master
o
sweet
lord
quoth
he
bethink
thee
now
of
the
warning
the
dead
hand
yet
must
i
go
my
roger
then
an
they
kill
thee
lord
so
shall
they
kill
me
also
thy
man
am
i
to
live
or
die
with
thee
nay
roger
sworn
art
thou
to
redeem
pentavalon
so
now
in
her
name
do
i
charge
thee
haste
to
sir
jocelyn
an
he
yet
live
seek
giles
and
walkyn
and
whoso
else
ye
may
and
bring
them
hither
at
speed
if
ye
find
me
not
here
then
hie
ye
all
to
thrasfordham
for
by
sir
pertolepe
and
gui
of
allerdale
will
have
raised
the
country
against
us
go
now
do
even
as
i
command
and
may
god
keep
thee
my
faithful
roger
then
beltane
began
to
climb
but
being
come
where
the
great
branch
forked
looked
down
to
see
roger
upturned
face
pale
amid
the
gloom
below
the
holy
angels
have
thee
in
their
keeping
lord
and
master
he
sighed
and
so
turned
with
head
and
was
gone
and
now
beltane
began
to
clamber
out
across
the
swirl
of
dark
waters
while
the
tough
bough
swung
and
swayed
beneath
him
in
every
gust
of
wind
wherefore
his
going
was
difficult
and
slow
and
he
took
heed
only
to
his
hands
and
feet
but
all
at
once
he
heard
a
bitter
broken
cry
and
glancing
up
it
chanced
that
from
his
lofty
perch
he
could
look
within
the
lighted
window
and
thus
beheld
a
nun
whose
slender
body
writhed
and
twisted
in
the
clasp
of
two
arms
vicious
arms
that
bent
her
back
and
back
across
the
rough
table
until
into
vision
came
the
form
of
him
that
held
her
a
shapely
man
whose
glowing
eyes
and
eager
mouth
stooped
ever
nearer
above
the
nun
white
loveliness
and
thus
it
was
that
my
beltane
first
looked
upon
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
he
had
laid
sword
and
armour
by
but
as
the
nun
yet
struggled
in
his
arms
her
white
hand
came
upon
and
drew
the
dagger
at
his
girdle
yet
ere
she
could
strike
sir
gilles
had
seen
and
leapt
back
out
of
reach
then
beltane
clambered
on
at
speed
and
with
every
yard
their
voices
grew
more
loud
hers
proud
and
disdainful
his
low
and
soft
pierced
now
and
then
by
an
evil
lazy
laugh
now
ever
as
beltane
went
the
branch
swayed
more
dizzily
bending
more
and
more
beneath
his
weight
and
ever
as
he
drew
nearer
between
the
came
snatches
of
their
talk
be
thou
nun
or
duchess
or
strolling
art
woman
by
venus
fair
and
passing
fair
captive
art
thou
aye
mine
i
tell
thee
yield
thee
hast
struggled
long
enough
to
save
thy
modesty
yield
thee
now
else
will
i
throw
thee
to
my
lusty
rogues
without
make
them
sport
o
beast
i
fear
thee
not
for
thy
men
how
shall
they
harm
me
seeing
i
shall
be
dead
down
swayed
the
branch
low
and
lower
until
beltane
mailed
foot
in
mid
air
found
something
beneath
slipped
away
found
it
again
and
thereupon
loosing
the
branch
down
he
came
upon
the
ruined
then
standing
upon
the
wheel
his
groping
fingers
found
divers
cracks
in
the
worn
masonry
moreover
the
ivy
was
thick
so
clinging
with
fingers
and
toes
up
he
went
higher
and
higher
until
his
hands
gripped
the
sill
thus
slowly
and
cautiously
he
drew
himself
up
until
his
golden
head
rose
above
the
sill
and
he
could
peer
into
the
room
sir
gilles
half
stood
half
sat
upon
the
table
while
the
nun
faced
him
cold
and
proud
and
disdainful
the
gleaming
dagger
clutched
to
her
bosom
and
sir
gilles
assured
and
confident
laughed
softly
as
he
leaned
so
lazily
yet
ever
he
watched
that
gleaming
steel
waiting
his
chance
to
spring
now
as
they
stood
fronting
each
other
thus
the
nun
stirred
beneath
his
close
regard
turned
her
head
and
on
the
instant
beltane
knew
that
she
had
seen
him
knew
by
the
sudden
tremor
of
her
lips
the
widening
of
her
dark
eyes
wherein
he
seemed
to
read
wonder
joy
and
a
passionate
entreaty
then
even
as
he
thrilled
to
meet
that
look
down
swept
languorous
lid
and
curling
lash
and
sighing
she
laid
the
dagger
on
the
table
for
a
moment
sir
gilles
stared
in
blank
amaze
then
laughed
his
lazy
laugh
ah
proud
beauty
is
surrender
then
said
he
and
speaking
reached
for
the
dagger
but
even
as
he
did
so
the
nun
seized
the
heavy
table
and
thrust
with
sudden
strength
so
that
sir
gilles
taken
unawares
staggered
back
and
back
to
the
window
then
beltane
reached
up
into
the
room
and
from
behind
caught
sir
gilles
by
the
throat
and
gripped
him
with
iron
fingers
strangling
all
outcry
and
so
drawing
himself
over
the
sill
and
into
the
room
dragged
sir
gilles
to
the
floor
and
choked
him
there
until
his
eyes
rolled
upward
and
he
lay
like
one
dead
then
swiftly
beltane
took
off
the
belt
of
sir
gilles
and
buckled
it
tight
about
the
wrists
and
arms
of
sir
gilles
and
rending
strips
from
sir
gilles
mantle
that
lay
near
therewith
fast
gagged
and
bound
him
now
it
chanced
that
as
he
knelt
thus
he
espied
the
dagger
where
it
lay
and
taking
it
up
glanced
from
it
to
sir
gilles
lying
motionless
in
his
bonds
but
as
he
hesitated
there
came
a
sudden
knocking
on
the
door
and
a
voice
spake
without
my
lord
my
lord
is
i
is
lupo
my
lord
our
men
be
few
and
wearied
as
ye
know
must
i
set
a
guard
beyond
the
ford
think
you
or
will
the
four
suffice
now
glancing
up
scarce
breathing
beltane
beheld
the
nun
who
crouched
down
against
the
wall
her
staring
eyes
turned
towards
the
door
her
cheeks
ashen
her
lips
with
deadly
fear
yet
even
so
she
spake
but
that
was
she
indeed
who
uttered
the
words
he
scarce
could
credit
so
soft
and
sweetly
slumberous
was
her
voice
my
lord
is
and
sleepeth
hush
you
and
come
again
with
the
dawn
now
was
a
moment
breathless
silence
and
thereafter
an
evil
chuckle
and
so
chuckling
the
man
lupo
went
down
the
rickety
stair
without
and
when
his
step
was
died
away
beltane
drew
a
deep
breath
and
together
they
arose
and
so
speaking
no
word
they
looked
upon
each
other
across
the
prostrate
body
of
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
chapter
xix
concerning
the
eyes
of
a
nun
eyes
long
and
darkly
blue
that
looked
up
awhile
into
his
and
anon
were
hid
lids
a
nose
tenderly
aquiline
lips
red
and
full
that
parted
but
to
meet
again
in
sweet
and
luscious
curves
a
chin
white
and
round
and
dimpled
this
beltane
saw
hood
and
wimple
by
aid
of
the
torch
that
flickered
against
the
wall
and
she
conscious
of
his
look
stood
with
white
hands
demurely
crossed
upon
her
rounded
bosom
with
eyes
abased
and
scarlet
lips
apart
as
one
who
waits
expectant
now
hereupon
my
beltane
felt
himself
vaguely
at
loss
and
finding
he
yet
held
the
dagger
set
it
upon
the
table
and
spake
reverend
mother
he
began
and
stopped
for
at
the
word
her
dark
lashes
lifted
and
she
stared
upon
him
curiously
while
slowly
her
red
lips
quivered
to
a
smile
and
surely
surely
this
nun
so
sweet
and
saintly
in
veiling
hood
and
wimple
was
yet
a
very
woman
young
and
passing
fair
and
the
eyes
of
her
how
deep
and
tender
and
yet
how
passionate
now
beholding
her
eyes
memory
stirred
within
him
and
he
sighed
whereat
she
sighed
also
and
meekly
bowed
her
head
speaking
him
with
all
humility
sweet
son
speak
on
thy
reverend
mother
heareth
now
did
beltane
my
innocent
rub
his
innocent
chin
and
stand
mumchance
awhile
finding
nought
to
say
then
lady
he
stammered
lady
since
i
have
found
thee
let
us
go
while
yet
we
may
messire
says
she
with
eyes
still
came
you
in
sooth
in
quest
of
me
yea
verily
i
heard
sir
gilles
had
made
captive
of
a
nun
so
came
i
to
deliver
her
an
so
it
might
be
though
she
were
old
and
wrinkled
and
toothless
messire
lady
says
my
innocent
staring
and
rubbing
his
chin
a
little
harder
surely
all
nuns
young
and
old
be
holy
women
worthy
a
reverence
and
humble
service
so
would
i
now
bear
thee
from
this
unhallowed
place
we
must
be
far
hence
ere
dawn
come
aye
but
whither
she
sighed
death
is
all
about
us
messire
how
may
we
escape
it
and
i
fear
death
no
whit
now
messire
aye
but
i
do
so
lady
since
i
have
other
and
greater
works
yet
to
achieve
how
messire
is
it
so
small
a
thing
to
have
saved
a
nun
even
though
she
be
neither
old
nor
wrinkled
nor
toothless
and
behold
the
meek
head
was
high
and
proud
her
humility
forgotten
quite
then
she
frowned
and
her
sombre
draperies
her
foot
fell
a
small
foot
dainty
and
slender
in
its
gaily
broidered
shoe
so
much
at
variance
with
her
dolorous
habit
but
beltane
recked
nought
of
this
for
espying
a
narrow
window
in
the
opposite
wall
he
came
thither
and
thrusting
his
head
without
looked
down
upon
the
sleeping
camp
and
thus
he
saw
that
sir
gilles
men
were
few
indeed
scarce
all
told
he
counted
as
they
lay
huddled
about
the
smouldering
as
only
men
greatly
wearied
might
even
the
sentinels
nodded
at
their
posts
and
all
was
still
save
for
the
rush
of
a
sudden
or
the
snort
and
trampling
of
the
horses
and
leaning
thus
beltane
marked
well
where
the
sentinels
lolled
upon
their
pikes
or
marched
drowsily
to
and
fro
betwixt
the
and
long
he
gazed
where
the
horses
were
tethered
two
swaying
trampling
lines
amid
the
further
shadows
now
being
busied
measuring
with
his
eye
the
distances
sentinel
and
sentinel
and
noting
where
the
shadows
lay
darkest
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
nun
close
beside
him
of
the
feel
of
her
soft
and
warm
against
him
and
starting
at
the
contact
turned
to
find
her
hand
small
and
white
upon
his
mailed
arm
sweet
son
said
she
from
the
shadow
of
her
sombre
hood
thy
reverend
mother
now
would
chide
thee
for
that
having
but
short
while
to
live
thou
dost
stand
thus
mumchance
staring
upon
vacancy
for
with
the
dawn
we
die
quoth
beltane
deeply
conscious
of
the
slender
hand
to
die
nay
nay
too
young
and
fair
to
die
sighed
she
with
rueful
smile
thou
too
art
neither
old
nor
cold
nor
bent
with
years
fair
son
come
then
till
death
let
us
speak
together
and
comfort
each
other
lay
by
thy
melancholy
as
i
now
lay
by
this
hood
and
wimple
for
the
night
is
hot
and
close
methinks
nay
lady
indeed
is
cool
for
there
is
much
wind
abroad
says
beltane
my
innocent
moreover
while
standing
here
methinks
i
have
seen
a
way
whereby
we
may
win
free
now
hereupon
she
turned
and
looked
on
him
and
with
eyes
of
fear
messire
she
panted
o
messire
bethink
thee
for
death
am
i
prepared
to
live
each
moment
fully
till
the
dawn
then
when
they
came
to
drag
me
down
to
to
shame
then
should
thy
dagger
free
me
quite
such
death
i
smile
to
meet
but
ah
should
we
strive
to
flee
and
thou
in
the
attempt
be
slain
and
i
alive
the
sport
of
that
vile
rabblement
below
o
christ
not
that
and
cowering
she
hid
her
face
noble
lady
said
beltane
looking
on
her
indeed
i
too
had
thought
on
that
and
coming
to
the
table
he
took
thence
the
dagger
of
sir
gilles
and
would
have
put
it
in
her
hand
but
lo
she
shrank
away
not
that
messire
not
that
she
sighed
thy
dagger
let
it
be
since
true
knight
art
thou
and
honourable
i
pray
you
give
me
thine
it
is
thy
reverend
mother
asks
and
smiling
pale
and
wan
she
reached
out
a
white
imperious
hand
so
beltane
drew
his
dagger
and
gave
it
to
her
keeping
then
having
set
the
other
in
his
girdle
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
stood
awhile
to
hearken
lady
said
he
there
is
no
way
for
us
but
this
stair
and
meseemeth
a
dangerous
way
yet
must
we
tread
it
together
reach
me
now
thy
hand
and
set
it
here
in
my
girdle
and
befall
loose
not
thy
hold
so
saying
beltane
drew
his
sword
and
set
wide
the
door
look
to
thy
feet
he
whispered
and
tread
soft
then
with
her
trailing
habit
caught
up
in
her
left
hand
and
with
her
right
upon
his
belt
the
nun
followed
beltane
out
upon
the
narrow
stair
step
by
step
they
stole
downwards
into
the
dark
pausing
with
breath
in
check
each
time
the
timbers
creaked
and
hearkening
with
straining
ears
down
they
went
amid
the
gloom
until
they
spied
an
open
door
below
beyond
which
a
dim
light
shone
and
whence
rose
the
snoring
of
wearied
sleepers
ever
and
anon
a
smote
the
ancient
mill
and
a
broken
shutter
rattled
near
by
what
time
they
crept
a
pace
down
the
creaking
stair
until
at
last
they
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
a
square
chamber
upon
whose
broken
hearth
a
waning
fire
burned
by
whose
uncertain
light
they
espied
divers
vague
forms
that
stirred
now
and
then
and
groaned
in
their
sleep
as
they
sprawled
upon
the
floor
and
beltane
counted
three
who
lay
him
and
the
open
doorway
for
door
was
there
none
awhile
stood
beltane
viewing
the
sleepers
frowning
brows
then
sheathing
his
sword
he
turned
and
reached
out
his
arms
to
the
nun
in
the
darkness
and
in
the
dark
she
gave
herself
warm
and
yielding
into
his
embrace
her
arms
clung
soft
about
him
and
he
felt
her
breath
upon
his
cheek
as
clasping
his
left
arm
about
her
he
lifted
her
high
against
his
breast
and
now
even
as
she
trembled
against
him
so
trembled
beltane
also
yet
knew
not
why
therefore
of
a
sudden
he
turned
and
stepped
into
the
chamber
a
man
started
up
beside
the
hearth
muttering
evilly
and
beltane
standing
rigid
gripped
his
dagger
to
smite
but
even
then
the
muttering
ceased
and
falling
back
the
man
rolled
over
and
fell
again
so
lightly
swiftly
beltane
strode
over
the
sprawling
sleepers
out
through
the
open
doorway
out
into
the
sweet
cool
night
beyond
out
into
the
merry
riot
of
the
wind
swift
and
sure
of
foot
he
sped
going
ever
where
the
shadows
lay
deepest
skirting
beyond
reach
of
the
paling
until
he
was
come
nigh
where
the
horses
stamped
and
snorted
here
he
set
the
nun
upon
her
feet
and
bidding
her
stir
not
crept
towards
the
horses
and
watchful
and
thus
he
presently
espied
a
man
who
leaned
him
upon
a
long
pike
his
face
set
toward
the
nearest
and
the
man
eyes
were
closed
and
he
snored
gently
then
beltane
shifted
his
dagger
to
his
left
hand
and
being
come
within
reach
drew
back
his
mailed
fist
and
smote
the
sleeper
betwixt
his
closed
eyes
and
catching
him
as
he
fell
laid
him
gently
on
the
grass
now
swift
and
silent
came
beltane
to
where
the
horses
champed
and
having
made
choice
of
a
certain
powerful
beast
slipped
off
his
chain
mittens
and
rolled
back
sleeve
of
mail
and
in
the
shadow
sought
and
found
the
ropes
whereto
the
halters
were
made
fast
and
straightway
cut
them
in
sunder
then
having
looked
to
girth
and
bridle
he
vaulted
to
the
saddle
and
drawing
sword
shouted
his
fierce
and
loud
arise
arise
and
so
shouting
smote
the
frighted
horses
to
right
and
left
with
the
flat
of
the
long
blade
so
that
they
reared
up
whinnying
and
set
off
in
all
directions
filling
the
air
with
the
thunder
of
their
rushing
hoofs
and
now
came
shouts
and
cries
with
a
prodigious
confusion
and
running
to
and
fro
about
the
dying
trumpets
blared
shrill
hoarse
voices
roared
commands
that
passed
unheeded
in
the
growing
din
and
tumult
that
swelled
to
a
wild
clamour
of
frenzied
shouting
fly
fly
pertolepe
is
upon
us
is
the
red
pertolepe
but
beltane
riding
warily
amid
the
gloom
came
to
that
place
where
he
had
left
the
nun
yet
found
her
not
and
immediately
was
seized
of
a
great
dread
but
as
he
stared
wildly
about
him
he
presently
heard
a
muffled
cry
and
spurring
thitherwards
beheld
two
dim
figures
that
swayed
to
and
fro
in
a
fierce
grapple
riding
close
beltane
saw
the
glint
of
mail
raised
his
sword
for
the
blow
felt
a
shock
a
searing
smart
and
knew
himself
wounded
but
now
she
was
at
his
stirrup
and
stooping
he
swung
her
up
to
the
withers
of
his
horse
and
wheeling
short
about
spurred
to
a
gallop
yet
as
he
rode
above
the
rush
of
wind
and
thud
of
hoofs
he
heard
a
cry
hoarse
and
dolorous
on
galloped
beltane
all
unheeding
until
he
came
the
leafy
arches
of
the
friendly
woods
within
whose
gloom
needs
must
he
ride
at
a
hand
pace
thus
as
they
went
they
could
hear
the
uproar
behind
a
confused
din
that
waxed
and
waned
upon
the
wind
but
beltane
riding
slow
and
cautious
within
the
green
heeded
this
not
at
all
nor
the
throb
of
his
wounded
arm
nor
aught
under
heaven
save
the
pressure
of
this
slender
body
that
lay
so
still
so
warm
and
soft
within
his
arm
and
as
he
went
he
began
to
wish
for
the
moon
that
he
might
see
her
face
blue
eyes
long
and
surely
blue
eyes
were
fairest
in
a
woman
and
then
the
voice
of
her
liquid
and
soft
like
the
call
of
merle
or
mavis
and
she
was
a
nun
how
white
and
slim
her
hands
yet
strong
and
resolute
as
when
she
grasped
the
dagger
sir
gilles
aye
resolute
hands
like
the
spirit
within
her
soft
and
shapely
body
and
then
again
her
lips
red
and
full
to
sweet
slow
smile
yet
withal
tinged
with
subtle
mockery
with
such
eyes
and
such
lips
she
might
aye
but
she
was
a
nun
a
nun
forsooth
messire
beltane
started
from
his
reverie
art
cold
messire
cold
stammered
beltane
cold
indeed
no
lady
yet
dost
thou
tremble
nathless
i
am
not
cold
lady
then
wherefore
tremble
nay
i
i
know
not
in
sooth
do
i
so
lady
verily
sir
and
therewith
sigh
frequent
and
o
most
dolorous
to
hear
now
at
this
my
beltane
finding
naught
to
say
straightway
sighed
again
and
thus
they
rode
awhile
speaking
nothing
think
you
we
are
safe
messire
she
questioned
him
at
last
tis
so
i
pray
lady
thou
hast
done
right
valiantly
on
my
behalf
says
she
how
came
you
in
at
the
window
by
means
of
a
tree
lady
art
very
strong
messire
and
valiant
beyond
thought
thou
hast
this
night
with
thy
strong
hand
lifted
me
up
from
shameful
death
so
by
right
should
my
life
be
thine
henceforth
herewith
she
sighed
leaning
closer
upon
his
breast
and
beltane
desire
to
see
her
face
grew
amain
messire
said
she
methinks
art
cold
indeed
or
is
it
that
i
weary
thee
nay
wondrous
easy
to
bear
thus
lady
and
whither
do
ye
bear
me
sir
north
or
south
and
yet
it
mattereth
nothing
says
she
since
we
are
safe
together
now
hereafter
as
beltane
rode
he
turned
his
eyes
full
oft
to
heaven
yearning
for
the
moon
what
woods
be
these
messire
she
questioned
is
the
wilderness
that
lieth
betwixt
pentavalon
and
mortain
lady
know
ye
mortain
sir
yea
verily
he
answered
and
sighed
full
deep
and
as
he
sighed
lo
in
that
moment
the
moon
peeped
forth
of
a
and
he
beheld
the
nun
looking
up
at
him
with
eyes
deep
and
wistful
and
as
she
gazed
her
lips
curved
in
slow
and
tender
smile
ere
her
lashes
drooped
and
sighing
she
hid
her
face
against
him
in
the
folds
of
her
mantle
while
beltane
must
needs
bethink
him
of
other
eyes
so
very
like
and
yet
so
false
and
straightway
sighed
messire
she
murmured
pray
now
wherefore
do
ye
sigh
so
oft
for
that
thine
eyes
do
waken
memory
lady
of
a
woman
aye
of
a
woman
and
thou
dost
love
her
messire
unto
my
dole
lady
ah
can
it
be
she
doth
not
love
thee
messire
indeed
is
most
certain
hath
she
then
told
thee
so
of
herself
nay
sighed
beltane
not
in
so
many
words
lady
and
yet
and
yet
quoth
the
nun
suddenly
erect
thou
must
needs
run
away
and
leave
her
poor
sweet
wretch
to
mourn
for
thee
belike
and
grieve
aye
and
scorn
thee
too
for
a
nay
lady
verily
i
o
indeed
me
thinks
she
must
contemn
thee
in
her
heart
poor
gentle
soul
aye
scorn
and
despise
thee
woefully
for
running
away
indeed
beyond
all
doubt
messire
lady
quoth
beltane
flushing
in
the
dark
you
know
naught
of
the
matter
why
then
shalt
thou
tell
me
of
it
messire
lo
i
am
listening
so
saying
she
settled
herself
more
aptly
within
his
encircling
arm
first
then
said
beltane
when
they
had
ridden
awhile
in
silence
she
is
a
duchess
and
very
proud
yet
is
she
a
woman
messire
and
thou
a
man
whose
arms
be
very
strong
of
what
avail
strong
arms
lady
such
as
she
why
to
carry
her
withal
messire
to
to
carry
her
quoth
beltane
in
amaze
in
very
truth
messire
to
lift
her
up
and
bear
her
away
with
thee
nay
nay
to
bear
her
away
o
thing
impossible
is
this
duchess
so
heavy
messire
sighed
the
nun
is
she
a
burden
beyond
even
thy
strength
sir
knight
lady
she
is
the
proud
helen
duchess
of
mortain
quoth
beltane
frowning
at
the
encompassing
shadows
now
was
the
nun
hushed
awhile
and
when
at
last
she
spake
her
voice
was
low
and
wondrous
gentle
and
is
it
indeed
the
wilful
helen
that
ye
love
messire
even
she
unto
my
sorrow
thy
sorrow
why
then
messire
forget
her
ah
sighed
beltane
would
i
might
indeed
yet
needs
must
i
love
her
ever
alack
and
is
it
so
forsooth
quoth
the
nun
sighing
likewise
ah
me
my
poor
fond
son
now
doth
thy
reverend
mother
pity
thee
indeed
for
in
direful
case
to
be
her
lover
methinks
now
did
my
beltane
frown
the
blacker
by
reason
of
bitter
memory
and
the
pain
of
his
wound
her
lover
aye
quoth
he
bitterly
and
she
hath
a
many
lovers
lovers
sighed
the
nun
that
hath
she
the
sad
sweet
soul
lovers
o
forsooth
she
is
sick
of
a
very
surfeit
of
lovers
so
hath
she
fled
from
them
all
fled
from
them
cried
beltane
his
wound
forgot
fled
from
them
from
mortain
nay
how
mean
you
how
fled
she
hath
walked
see
you
run
ridden
is
riding
away
from
mortain
from
her
lords
her
counsellors
her
varlets
her
lovers
and
what
not
in
a
word
messire
she
is
gone
gone
quoth
beltane
breathless
and
aghast
gone
aye
but
whither
what
matter
for
that
so
long
as
her
grave
counsellors
be
sufficiently
vexed
and
her
lovers
left
o
me
her
counsellors
see
you
and
who
for
their
own
ends
would
have
her
wed
duke
ivo
meek
unfortunate
maid
know
you
then
the
duchess
lady
aye
forsooth
and
my
heart
doth
grieve
for
her
poor
sweet
wretch
for
o
is
a
sad
thing
to
be
a
duchess
with
a
multitude
of
suitors
in
season
and
out
vaunting
graces
she
hath
not
and
blind
to
the
virtues
she
doth
possess
ah
messire
i
give
thee
joy
that
whatsoever
ills
may
be
thine
thou
can
be
a
duchess
and
think
you
she
will
not
wed
with
ivo
lady
think
you
so
in
truth
never
while
she
is
helen
and
loveth
none
of
her
lovers
why
indeed
messire
i
think
she
doth
art
sure
how
know
you
this
i
was
her
bedfellow
betimes
and
oft
within
the
night
have
heard
her
speak
a
name
unto
her
pillow
as
maids
will
now
once
again
was
beltane
aware
of
the
throb
and
sting
of
his
wounded
arm
yet
was
not
because
of
this
he
sighed
so
deep
and
oft
spake
she
this
name
often
he
questioned
very
oft
messire
aye
me
how
chill
the
wind
blows
some
lord
name
belike
nay
was
no
lord
name
messire
is
very
dark
amid
these
trees
some
knight
mayhap
or
lowly
squire
neither
messire
heigho
methinks
i
now
could
sleep
awhile
so
she
sighed
deep
yet
happily
and
nestled
closer
within
his
shielding
arm
but
beltane
my
innocent
rode
stiff
in
the
saddle
staring
into
the
gloom
nor
felt
nor
heeded
the
yielding
tenderness
of
the
shapely
young
body
he
held
but
plodded
on
through
the
dark
frowning
blacker
than
the
night
now
as
he
rode
thus
little
by
little
the
pain
of
his
wound
grew
less
a
drowsiness
crept
upon
him
and
therewith
a
growing
faintness
little
by
little
his
head
drooped
low
and
lower
and
once
the
arm
about
the
nun
slipped
its
hold
whereat
she
sighed
and
stirred
sleepily
upon
his
breast
but
on
he
rode
striving
grimly
against
the
growing
faintness
his
feet
thrust
far
within
the
stirrups
his
mailed
hand
tight
clenched
upon
the
reins
so
as
dawn
broke
he
heard
the
pleasant
sound
of
running
water
near
by
and
as
the
light
grew
saw
they
were
come
to
a
grassy
glade
where
ran
a
small
brook
a
goodly
place
and
remote
so
turned
he
thitherward
and
lifting
up
heavy
eyes
beheld
the
stars
paling
to
the
dawn
for
the
clouds
were
all
passed
away
and
the
wind
was
gone
long
since
and
in
a
while
being
come
within
the
boskage
of
this
green
dell
feebly
and
as
one
he
checked
the
great
horse
that
snuffed
eagerly
toward
the
murmuring
brook
and
as
one
saw
that
she
who
had
slumbered
on
his
breast
was
awake
fresh
and
sweet
as
the
dawn
lady
he
stammered
i
i
fear
i
can
ride
no
farther
and
now
as
one
he
beheld
her
start
and
look
at
him
with
eyes
wide
and
darkly
blue
within
whose
depths
was
that
which
stirred
within
him
a
memory
of
other
days
in
so
much
he
would
have
spoken
yet
found
the
words
unready
and
hard
to
come
by
lady
thine
eyes
methinks
are
not
nun
eyes
but
now
behold
of
a
sudden
she
cried
out
soft
and
pitiful
for
blood
was
upon
him
upon
his
brow
upon
his
golden
hair
and
still
as
one
he
felt
her
slip
from
his
failing
clasp
felt
her
arms
close
about
him
aiding
him
to
earth
hurt
she
cried
o
wounded
and
i
never
guessed
is
but
my
arm
in
sooth
and
but
she
hushed
him
with
soft
and
commands
and
aiding
him
to
the
brook
laid
him
thereby
to
lave
his
hurt
within
the
cool
sweet
water
and
waking
with
the
smart
beltane
sighed
and
turned
to
look
up
at
her
now
did
she
meeting
his
eyes
put
up
one
white
hand
setting
back
sombre
hood
and
snowy
wimple
and
stooping
tenderly
above
him
behold
in
that
moment
down
came
the
shining
glory
of
her
lustrous
hair
to
fall
about
the
glowing
beauty
of
her
face
touching
his
brow
like
a
caress
then
at
last
memory
awoke
within
him
and
lifting
himself
upon
a
feeble
elbow
he
stared
upon
her
glowing
loveliness
with
wide
glad
eyes
helen
he
sighed
o
helen
and
so
sighing
fell
back
and
lay
there
pale
and
wan
within
the
dawn
but
with
a
smile
upon
his
pallid
lips
chapter
xx
how
beltane
plighted
his
troth
in
the
green
beltane
yawned
prodigiously
stretched
mightily
and
opening
sleepy
eyes
looked
about
him
he
lay
shady
willows
within
a
leafy
bower
before
him
a
brook
ran
leaping
to
the
sunshine
and
filling
the
warm
stilly
air
with
its
merry
chatter
and
soft
laughing
noises
while
beyond
the
rippling
water
the
bank
sloped
steeply
upward
to
the
green
silence
of
the
woods
now
as
beltane
lay
thus
sleeping
and
waking
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
night
he
had
dreamed
a
wondrous
dream
and
fain
he
would
have
slept
again
but
now
from
an
adjacent
thicket
a
horse
whinnied
and
beltane
starting
at
the
sound
felt
his
wound
throb
with
sudden
pain
and
looking
down
beheld
his
arm
most
aptly
swathed
in
bandages
of
fair
soft
linen
now
would
he
have
sat
up
but
marvelled
to
find
it
so
great
a
matter
and
propping
himself
instead
upon
a
weak
elbow
glanced
about
him
expectantly
and
lo
in
that
moment
one
spake
near
by
in
voice
rich
and
soft
like
the
call
of
merle
or
mavis
beltane
said
the
voice
beltane
the
smith
with
heart
beltane
turned
and
beheld
the
duchess
helen
standing
beside
him
her
glorious
hair
wrought
into
two
long
braids
wherein
flowers
were
cunningly
entwined
straightway
he
would
have
risen
but
she
forbade
him
with
a
gesture
and
coming
closer
sank
beside
him
on
her
knees
and
being
there
blushed
and
sighed
yet
touched
him
not
hurt
said
she
so
must
we
bide
here
awhile
thou
to
win
thy
strength
again
and
i
to
minister
unto
thee
mutely
awhile
my
beltane
gazed
upon
her
shy
sweet
loveliness
what
time
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
tempestuous
and
she
bowed
her
head
full
low
helen
he
whispered
at
last
o
art
thou
indeed
the
duchess
helen
not
so
she
murmured
helen
was
duchess
whiles
she
was
in
mortain
but
i
that
speak
with
thee
am
a
lonely
maid
indeed
a
very
lonely
maid
who
hath
sighed
for
thee
and
wept
for
thee
and
for
thee
hath
left
her
duchy
of
mortain
beltane
for
me
quoth
beltane
leaning
near
was
it
for
me
ah
was
it
so
in
very
sooth
beltane
said
she
looking
not
toward
him
last
night
thou
bear
a
nun
within
thine
arms
and
looking
on
her
with
love
aflame
within
thine
eyes
did
yet
vow
to
her
you
loved
this
duchess
tell
me
who
am
but
a
lonely
maid
is
this
so
thou
knowest
i
love
her
ever
and
always
he
answered
and
yet
quoth
she
shaking
her
head
and
looking
up
with
eyes
of
witchery
thou
love
this
nun
also
though
is
true
thou
name
her
mother
o
wert
very
blind
beltane
and
yet
thou
love
her
also
methinks
needs
must
i
ever
and
always
he
answered
ah
beltane
but
i
would
have
thee
love
this
lonely
maid
dearest
of
all
henceforth
an
it
may
be
so
for
that
she
is
so
very
lonely
and
hath
sought
thee
so
long
sought
me
he
murmured
gazing
on
her
nay
how
may
this
be
for
with
my
kisses
warm
upon
thy
lips
thou
bid
me
farewell
long
time
since
at
mortain
within
the
green
and
thou
she
sighed
and
thou
leave
me
beltane
o
would
thou
had
kissed
me
once
again
and
held
me
in
thine
arms
so
might
we
have
known
less
of
sorrow
indeed
methinks
was
cruel
to
leave
me
so
beltane
cruel
says
my
beltane
and
thereafter
fell
silent
from
sheer
amaze
the
while
she
sighed
again
and
bowed
her
shapely
head
and
plucked
a
daisy
from
the
grass
to
turn
it
about
and
about
in
gentle
fingers
so
beltane
quoth
she
at
last
being
young
and
cruel
thou
leave
the
duchess
a
lonely
maid
yet
that
same
night
did
she
this
tender
maid
seek
out
thy
lowly
dwelling
the
green
to
yield
herself
joyfully
unto
thee
thenceforth
but
ah
beltane
she
found
the
place
a
ruin
and
thou
wert
gone
and
o
methinks
her
heart
came
nigh
to
breaking
then
did
she
vow
that
no
man
might
ever
have
her
to
his
love
save
only
thou
so
an
thou
love
her
not
beltane
needs
must
she
die
a
maid
now
beltane
forgot
his
weakness
and
rose
to
his
knees
and
lifted
her
bowed
head
until
he
might
look
deep
within
the
yearning
tenderness
of
her
eyes
a
while
she
met
his
look
then
blushing
trembling
all
in
a
moment
she
swayed
toward
him
hiding
her
face
against
him
and
trembling
also
beltane
caught
her
close
within
his
arms
and
held
her
to
his
heart
dost
thou
love
me
so
indeed
my
lady
art
thou
mine
own
henceforth
helen
the
beautiful
ah
love
she
murmured
in
all
my
days
have
i
loved
other
man
than
thou
my
beltane
so
now
do
i
give
myself
to
thee
in
life
and
death
in
joy
and
sorrow
thine
will
i
be
beloved
quoth
beltane
as
thou
art
mine
so
am
i
thine
henceforth
and
forever
and
thus
kneeling
together
within
the
wilderness
did
they
plight
their
troth
and
tremulous
with
arms
that
clasped
and
clung
and
eager
lips
that
parted
but
to
meet
again
beltane
she
sighed
ah
beltane
hold
me
close
i
wearied
for
thee
so
long
so
long
hold
me
close
beloved
see
now
as
thou
dost
hate
the
pomp
and
stir
of
cities
so
for
thy
sake
have
i
fled
hither
to
the
wilderness
to
live
with
thee
amid
these
solitudes
to
be
thy
love
thy
stay
and
comfort
here
will
we
live
for
each
other
and
hid
within
the
green
forget
the
world
and
all
things
else
save
only
our
great
love
but
now
it
chanced
that
raising
his
head
beltane
beheld
his
long
sword
leaning
against
a
tree
hard
by
and
beholding
it
thus
he
bethought
him
straightway
of
the
duke
his
father
of
pentavalon
and
of
her
grievous
wrongs
and
his
clasping
hands
grew
lax
and
fell
away
and
groaning
he
bowed
his
head
whereat
she
started
and
questioned
him
soft
and
piteous
is
it
thy
wound
i
had
forgot
ah
love
forgive
me
see
here
a
pillow
for
thy
dear
head
but
now
again
he
caught
her
to
him
close
and
fierce
and
kissed
her
oft
and
holding
her
thus
spake
thou
knowest
i
do
love
thee
my
helen
yet
because
i
love
thee
greatly
love
alas
must
wait
awhile
wait
she
cried
ah
no
am
i
not
thine
own
is
so
i
would
be
worthy
of
thee
beloved
he
sighed
for
know
that
i
am
pledged
to
rest
not
nor
stay
until
my
task
be
accomplished
or
i
slain
slain
thou
o
helen
is
a
mighty
task
and
desperate
and
many
perchance
must
die
ere
this
my
vow
be
accomplished
thy
vow
but
thou
art
a
smith
my
beltane
what
hath
humble
smith
to
do
with
vows
thou
art
my
love
my
beltane
the
smith
indeed
sighed
beltane
smith
was
i
aforetime
and
therewithal
content
yet
am
i
also
son
of
my
father
and
he
hark
she
whispered
white
hand
upon
his
lips
some
one
comes
through
the
leaves
yonder
so
saying
she
sprang
lightly
to
her
feet
and
stood
above
him
straight
and
tall
and
though
she
trembled
yet
he
saw
her
eyes
were
fearless
and
his
dagger
gleamed
steady
in
her
hands
beltane
my
love
she
said
so
weak
yet
am
i
strong
to
defend
thee
against
them
all
but
beltane
rose
also
and
swaying
on
unsteady
feet
kissed
her
once
and
so
took
his
sword
marvelling
to
find
it
so
heavy
and
drew
it
from
the
scabbard
and
ever
upon
the
stilly
air
the
rustle
of
leaves
grew
louder
beltane
she
sighed
they
be
very
near
hearken
beltane
thine
am
i
in
life
in
death
an
this
be
death
what
matter
since
we
die
together
but
leaning
on
his
sword
beltane
watched
her
with
eyes
of
love
yet
spake
no
word
hearkening
to
the
growing
stir
amid
the
leaves
until
of
a
sudden
upon
the
bank
above
the
underbrush
was
parted
and
a
man
stood
looking
down
at
them
a
tall
man
whose
linked
mail
glinted
evilly
and
whose
face
was
hid
a
vizored
casque
now
of
a
sudden
he
put
up
his
vizor
and
stepped
toward
them
down
the
sloping
bank
then
the
duchess
let
fall
the
dagger
and
reached
out
her
hands
godric
she
sighed
o
godric
chapter
xxi
of
the
tale
of

the
huntsman
thus
came
old
godric
the
huntsman
lusty
despite
his
years
and
garrulous
with
joy
to
fall
upon
his
knees
before
his
lady
and
to
kiss
those
outstretched
hands
godric
she
cried
is
my
good
godric
and
laughed
though
with
lips
o

and
begged

cried
the

godric
garrulous
and
grim
thereafter

after

i

very
wistfully
so

guide

two
eyes

i
behold
the
black
ruin
of

a
woeful
sight
and
divers
tales

i
heard
of

unaided
and
alone

and
bear

sir
pertolepe
called

description

sighed
the
duchess
a
little
wearily
as
thus

of

the

the
duchess
and
turned
to
look
upon

in
and
about
his
middle
a
broad
belt
of
gold
and
silver
item
beareth

graven
the
legend
lady

cried
godric
for
now
following
the
duchess
glance
he
beheld
beltane
leaning
upon
his
long
sword
then
while
godric
stared
the
duchess
looked
on
beltane
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
and
with
hands
tight
clasped
while
beltane
looking
upon
her
sighed
amain
helen
he
cried
o
helen
is
true
that
i
who
am
beltane
the
smith

likewise
son
of
beltane
duke
of
pentavalon
behold

the
sword
of
the
duke
my
father
nor
must

vanquished
and
oppression
driven
hence
thus
see
you
i
may
not
stay
to
love
within
my
life
it
must
not
be
and
speaking
beltane
groaned
and
bowed
his
head
so
came
she
to
him
and
looked
on
him
with
eyes
of
yearning
yet
touched
him
not
dear
my
lord
said
she
thou

a
noble
duke
methinks
and
yet
alas
needs
must
i
love
my
gentle
beltane
the
smith
and
i
did
love
him
so
thou
art
a
mighty
my
lord
and
terrible
in
war
meseemeth
o
methinks
thou
wilt
make
a
goodly
duke
indeed
mayhap
he
answered
heavily
mayhap
an
god
spare
me
long
enough
but
now
must
i
leave
thee
aye
but
wherefore
thou
hast
heard
i
am
a
hunted
man
with
a
price
upon
my
head
by
my
side
goeth
death
so

go
also
she
murmured
ever
and
always
beside
thee
thou
ah
not
so
beloved
i
must
tread
me
this
path
alone
as
for
thee
haste
haste
and
get
thee
to
mortain
and
safety
and
there
wait
for
me
pray
for
me
o
my
love
beltane
beltane
she
sighed
dost
love
me
indeed
and
yet
would
send
me
from
thee
aye
he
groaned
needs
must
it
be
so
beltane
she
murmured
beltane
thou
shalt
be
duke
within
the
week
despite
black
ivo
duke
i
of
pentavalon
of
mortain
she
whispered
an
thou
wilt
wed
me
my
lord
nay
stammered
beltane
nay
outcast
am
i
my
friends
very
few
to
wed
thee
thus
therefore
were
shame
to
wed
me
thus
said
she
should
be
my
joy
and
thy
joy
and
pentavalon
salvation
mayhap
o
see
you
not
beltane
thou
be
henceforth
my
lord
my
to
lead
my
powers
duke
ivo
teaching
mortain
to
cringe
no
more
to
a
usurper
to
free
pentavalon
from
her
sorrows
ah
see
you
not
beltane
helen
he
murmured
o
helen
poor
am
i
a
beggar
beltane
she
whispered
an
thou
wed
this
lonely
maid
within
the
forest
then
will
i
be
beggar
with
thee
but
an
thou
take
to
wife
the
duchess
then
shalt
thou
be
my
duke
lord
of
me
and
of
mortain
with
her
ten
thousand
lances
in
thy
train
thou
give
me
so
much
he
sighed
at
last
so
much
my
helen
nay
said
she
with
red
lips
curved
and
tender
for
this
wide
world
to
me
is
naught
without
thee
beltane
and
i
do
need
thy
mighty
arm
to
shelter
me
beltane
since
ivo
hath
defied
me
threatening
mortain
with
fire
and
sword
so
when
he
cometh
instead
of
a
woman
he
shall
find
a
man
to
withstand
him
whose
sword
is
swift
and
strong
to
smite
and
who
doeth
such
deeds
as
no
man
ever
did
so
shalt
thou
be
my
love
my
lord
my
champion
wilt
not
refuse
me
the
shelter
of
thy
strength
beltane
now
of
a
sudden
beltane
lifted
his
head
and
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
close
quoth
he
so
be
it
my
helen
to
wife
will
i
take
thee
so
soon
as
may
be
to
hold
thee
ever
in
love
and
reverence
to
serve
thee
ever
to
live
for
thee
and
for
thee
to
die
an
needs
be
but
now
strode
godric
forward
with
hands
outstretched
in
eager
protest
lady
he
cried
o
dear
lady
bethink
thee
now
bethink
thee
thy
choice
is
a
perilous
choice
yet
is
it
my
choice
godric
but
o
dear
my
mistress
o
my
faithful
godric
look
now
upon
lord
beltane
my
who
shall
be
duke
of
mortain
ere
the
moon
change
salute
thy
lord
godric
so
perforce
came
old
godric
to
fall
upon
his
knee
before
beltane
to
take
his
hand
and
swear
the
oath
of
fealty
lord
beltane
said
he
son
art
thou
of
a
mighty
duke
god
send
mortain
find
in
thee
such
another
amen
said
beltane
thereafter
godric
rose
and
pointed
up
to
the
zenith
behold
my
lady
said
he
it
groweth
to
noon
and
there
is
danger
hereabouts
more
danger
than
i
had
dreamed
let
us
therefore
haste
over
into
mortain
to
thy
manor
of
blaen
but
godric
see
you
not
my
lord
is
faint
of
his
wound
and
blaen
is
far
methinks
not
so
lady
is
scarce
six
hours
journey
to
the
north
nay
i
do
know
of
lonely
that
shall
bring
us
sooner
to
blaen
mused
the
duchess
winfrida
is
there
and
yet
and
yet
aye
let
us
to
blaen
there
will
i
nurse
thee
to
thy
strength
again
my
beltane
and
there
shalt
thou
wed
with
me
an
it
be
so
thy
pleasure
in
sooth
my
lord
so
in
a
while
they
set
off
through
the
forest
first
godric
to
guide
them
then
beltane
astride
the
great
with
the
duchess
before
him
she
very
anxious
for
his
wound
yet
speaking
oft
of
the
future
with
flushing
cheek
and
eyes
thus
as
the
sun
declined
they
came
forth
of
the
and
beheld
that
broad
sweep
of
hill
and
dale
that
was
mortain
o
loved
mortain
she
sighed
o
dear
mortain
is
here
there
lived
a
smith
my
beltane
who
sang
of
and
loved
but
birds
and
trees
and
flowers
is
here
there
lived
a
duchess
proud
and
most
disdainful
who
yearned
for
love
yet
knew
naught
of
it
until
upon
a
day
these
twain
looked
within
each
other
eyes
o
day
most
blissful
ah
sweet
mortain
by
pleasant
ways
they
went
past
smiling
fields
and
sleepy
villages
bowered
the
green
they
rode
ever
by
sequestered
paths
skirting
shady
wood
and
coppice
where
birds
sang
soft
a
drowsy
lullaby
wooing
the
world
to
forgetfulness
and
rest
fording
prattling
brook
and
whispering
stream
whose
placid
waters
flamed
to
the
glory
of
sunset
and
thus
they
came
at
last
to
blaen
a
cloistered
hamlet
beyond
which
rose
the
grey
walls
of
the
ancient
manor
itself
now
as
they
drew
near
being
yet
sheltered
the
green
old
godric
halted
in
his
stride
and
pointed
to
the
highway
that
ran
in
the
vale
below
lady
quoth
he
mine
eyes
be
old
and
yet
methinks
i
should
know
yon
horseman
that
rideth
unhelmed
so
close
beside
the
lady
winfrida
that
breadth
of
shoulder
that
length
of
limb
lady
how
think
ye
is
duke
ivo
she
whispered
aye
nodded
godric
armed
see
you
yet
with
but
two
esquires
and
with
winfrida
said
the
duchess
frowning
can
it
indeed
be
as
i
have
thought
betimes
and
blaen
is
a
very
solitary
place
see
whispered
godric
the
duke
leaveth
her
behold
him
kiss
her
hand
ha
he
summoneth
his
esquires
hey
now
see
how
they
ride
sharp
spur
and
loose
bridle
is
ever
ivo
way
now
when
the
duke
and
his
esquires
were
vanished
in
the
dusk
and
the
sound
of
their
galloping
died
away
the
duchess
sprang
lightly
to
the
sward
and
bidding
them
wait
until
she
summoned
them
hasted
on
before
thus
in
a
while
as
winfrida
the
fair
paced
slowly
along
upon
her
ambling
palfrey
her
blue
eyes
she
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
rustling
near
by
and
glancing
swiftly
up
beheld
the
duchess
helen
standing
before
her
tall
and
proud
her
black
brows
wrinkled
faintly
her
eyes
stern
and
challenging
lady
dear
my
lady
stammered
winfrida
is
it
thou
indeed
since
when
quoth
the
duchess
yet
menacing
since
when
doth
winfrida
hold
sly
meeting
with
one
that
is
enemy
to
me
and
to
mortain
enemy
nay
whom
mean
you
indeed
i
o
helen
in
sooth
was
but
by
chance
is
this
treason
my
lady
winfrida
or
only
foolish
amourette
sweet
lady
was
but
chance
an
you
mean
duke
ivo
he
came
i
saw
my
lady
winfrida
i
pray
you
go
before
we
will
speak
of
this
anon
come
godric
she
called
then
the
lady
winfrida
her
beauteous
head
rode
on
before
sighing
deep
and
oft
yet
nothing
speaking
with
the
duchess
proud
and
stern
beside
her
while
beltane
and
godric
followed
after
and
so
it
was
they
came
to
the
manor
of
blaen
chapter
xxii
concerning
the
wiles
of
winfrida
the
fair
now
in
these
days
did
my
beltane
know
more
of
joy
and
come
more
nigh
to
happiness
than
ever
in
his
life
before
all
day
from
morn
till
eve
the
duchess
was
beside
him
each
hour
her
changing
moods
won
him
to
deeper
love
each
day
her
glowing
beauty
enthralled
him
the
more
so
that
as
his
strength
grew
so
grew
his
love
for
her
oft
would
they
sit
together
in
her
garden
amid
the
flowers
and
she
busied
with
her
broidering
needle
would
question
him
of
his
doings
and
betimes
her
breast
would
heave
and
her
dexterous
hand
tremble
and
falter
to
hear
of
dangers
past
or
talking
of
the
future
her
gracious
head
would
droop
with
cheeks
that
flushed
most
maidenly
until
beltane
kneeling
to
her
loveliness
would
clasp
her
in
his
arms
while
she
would
bid
him
beware
her
needle
to
him
all
tender
sweetness
yet
to
all
others
within
the
manor
was
she
the
duchess
proud
and
stately
moreover
when
she
met
the
lady
winfrida
in
hall
or
bower
her
slender
brows
would
wrinkle
faintly
and
her
voice
sound
cold
and
distant
whereat
the
fair
winfrida
would
bow
her
meek
head
and
sighing
wring
her
shapely
fingers
now
it
befell
upon
a
drowsy
afternoon
that
waking
from
slumber
within
the
garden
beltane
found
himself
alone
so
he
arose
and
walked
amid
the
flowers
thinking
of
many
things
but
of
the
duchess
helen
most
of
all
as
he
wandered
slowly
thus
his
head
bent
and
eyes
he
came
unto
a
certain
shady
arbour
where
fragrant
herb
and
climbing
blooms
wrought
a
tender
twilight
apt
to
blissful
musing
now
standing
within
this
perfumed
shade
he
heard
of
a
sudden
a
light
step
behind
him
and
turning
swift
about
his
eager
arms
closed
upon
a
soft
and
yielding
form
and
behold
it
was
winfrida
then
beltane
would
have
loosed
his
clasp
but
her
white
hands
reached
up
and
clung
upon
his
broad
shoulders
yet
when
she
spake
her
voice
was
low
and
humble
my
lord
beltane
she
sighed
happy
art
thou
to
have
won
the
love
of
our
noble
lady
aye
happy
art
thou
but
as
for
me
alas
messire
meseemeth
her
heart
is
turned
me
these
days
i
who
was
her
loved
companion
and
childish
so
now
am
i
very
desolate
wherefore
i
pray
you
speak
with
her
on
my
behalf
and
win
her
to
forgiveness
ah
messire
when
thou
shalt
be
duke
indeed
think
kindly
on
the
poor
winfrida
for
as
i
most
truly
love
the
duchess
here
needs
must
she
sigh
amain
and
turn
aside
her
shapely
head
and
thereafter
spake
clear
and
loud
so
will
i
love
thee
also
then
while
he
yet
stood
abashed
by
the
touch
of
her
and
the
look
in
her
eyes
she
caught
his
hand
to
her
lips
and
fled
away
out
of
the
arbour
but
now
as
he
stood
staring
after
her
beyond
all
thought
amazed
a
white
hand
parted
the
leafy
screen
and
the
duchess
stood
before
him
and
behold
her
slender
brows
were
wrinkled
faintly
and
when
she
spake
her
voice
was
cold
and
distant
saw
you
the
lady
winfrida
my
lord
why
truly
stammered
beltane
truly
i
she
was
here
but
now
here
my
lord
alone
she
besought
me
speak
thee
for
her
forgiveness
to
remind
thee
of
her
love
aforetime
to
plead
for
her
in
sooth
i
would
but
have
thee
do
her
justice
helen
think
you
i
am
so
unjust
my
lord
not
so
indeed
but
she
is
so
young
so
fair
aye
she
is
very
fair
my
lord
there
be
others
think
the
same
helen
said
he
o
helen
and
thou
dost
plead
for
her
and
to
me
my
lord
and
with
her
kisses
yet
burning
thee
she
did
but
kiss
my
hand
thy
hand
my
lord
o
aye
thy
hand
forsooth
aye
my
hand
lady
and
therewith
named
me
quoth
beltane
beginning
to
frown
whereat
needs
must
the
duchess
laugh
very
soft
and
sweet
yet
with
eyes
aglow
beneath
her
lashes
messire
she
names
thee
so
betimes
meseemeth
thou
art
not
duke
yet
nor
thou
ever
be
but
of
my
favour
and
the
time
flieth
apace
sighed
beltane
and
i
have
mighty
things
to
do
o
methinks
i
have
tarried
here
overlong
ah
and
be
going
messire
is
so
methinks
my
duty
go
you
alone
messire
or
goeth
she
with
thee
ah
god
how
dare
ye
so
think
cried
beltane
in
anger
so
fierce
and
sudden
that
though
she
fronted
him
yet
smiling
she
drew
back
a
pace
whereat
his
anger
fell
from
him
and
he
reached
out
his
hands
helen
said
he
o
my
helen
what
madness
is
this
thou
art
she
i
love
doth
not
thine
heart
tell
thee
so
and
fain
would
he
have
caught
her
to
him
ah
touch
me
not
she
cried
and
steel
flickered
in
her
hand
this
to
me
quoth
he
and
laughed
short
and
bitter
and
catching
her
wrist
shook
the
dagger
from
her
grasp
and
set
his
foot
upon
it
and
hath
it
come
to
this
thee
and
me
he
sighed
o
she
panted
i
have
loved
thee
nor
shamed
to
show
thee
my
love
yet
because
my
love
is
so
great
so
methinks
an
need
be
i
might
hate
thee
more
than
any
man
then
flushed
and
trembling
she
turned
and
sped
away
leaving
beltane
and
with
the
dagger
gleaming
beneath
his
foot
chapter
xxiii
of
the
humility
of
helen
the
proud
beltane
leaning
forth
of
his
lattice
stared
upon
the
moon
with
doleful
eyes
heavy
with
sense
of
wrong
and
big
with
i
have
dreamed
a
wondrous
fair
dream
said
he
within
himself
but
all
dreams
must
end
so
is
my
dream
vanished
quite
and
i
awake
and
being
awake
now
will
i
arise
and
go
upon
my
duty
then
turned
he
to
his
bed
that
stood
beside
the
window
and
forthwith
began
to
arm
himself
but
with
every
lace
he
drew
with
every
strap
he
buckled
he
sighed
amain
and
his
waxed
the
mightier
he
bethought
him
of
his
father
sayings
anent
the
love
of
women
and
in
his
mind
condemned
them
all
as
fickle
and
and
in
a
while
being
armed
from
head
to
foot
in
glistening
coif
and
hauberk
and
with
sword
girt
about
his
middle
he
came
back
to
the
lattice
and
leaned
him
there
to
stare
again
upon
the
moon
to
wait
until
the
manor
should
be
wrapped
in
sleep
and
to
grieve
for
himself
with
every
breath
he
drew
being
thus
so
profoundly
occupied
and
moreover
his
head
being
thrust
without
the
window
he
heard
nought
of
the
tap
upon
his
chamber
door
nor
of
the
whispered
sound
of
his
name
thus
he
started
to
feel
a
touch
upon
his
arm
and
turning
beheld
the
duchess
she
wore
a
simple
robe
that
fell
about
her
body
round
loveliness
in
sweetly
revealing
folds
her
hair
all
unbraided
was
caught
up
a
jewelled
fillet
in
careless
fashion
but
o
surely
surely
never
had
she
looked
so
fair
so
sweet
and
tender
so
soft
and
desirable
as
now
the
yet
agleam
upon
her
drooping
lashes
and
her
bosom
yet
heaving
with
recent
grief
and
thou
art
armed
my
lord
i
ride
for
this
night
my
lady
but
i
am
come
to
thee
humbly
craving
thy
forgiveness
beltane
nought
have
i
to
forgive
thee
lady
save
that
thou
art
woman
thou
not
have
me
a
man
messire
be
less
hard
to
leave
thee
thou
art
leaving
me
then
beltane
yea
indeed
my
lady
the
woes
of
pentavalon
call
to
me
with
a
thousand
tongues
i
must
away
pray
god
i
have
not
tarried
too
long
but
art
yet
weak
of
thy
wound
beltane
i
pray
thee
tarry
a
little
longer
ah
my
lord
let
not
two
lives
go
empty
because
of
the
arts
of
a
false
friend
for
well
do
i
know
that
winfrida
seeing
me
coming
to
thee
in
the
garden
kissed
thee
of
set
purpose
that
beholding
i
might
grieve
is
this
indeed
so
my
lady
she
did
confess
it
but
now
said
she
so
indeed
aye
my
lord
after
i
had
pulled
her
hair
a
little
but
o
my
beltane
even
when
i
thought
thee
base
i
loved
thee
ah
go
not
from
me
stay
but
until
and
then
shalt
thou
wed
me
for
thine
own
leave
me
not
beltane
for
indeed
i
can
not
live
without
thee
so
saying
she
sank
down
upon
his
couch
hiding
her
face
in
the
pillow
now
came
beltane
and
leaned
above
her
helen
he
whispered
and
falling
upon
his
knees
he
set
his
arms
about
her
then
lifted
she
her
tearful
face
and
looked
upon
him
in
the
moonlight
and
lying
thus
of
a
sudden
reached
out
white
arms
to
him
and
in
her
eyes
was
love
and
on
her
quivering
lips
and
in
all
the
yearning
beauty
of
her
love
called
to
him
close
close
he
caught
her
in
his
embrace
kissing
her
hard
and
fierce
and
her
long
hair
came
down
to
veil
them
in
its
glory
then
trembling
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
bore
her
forth
of
his
chamber
out
into
the
hall
beyond
where
lights
flickered
against
wall
there
falling
upon
his
knees
before
her
he
hid
his
face
within
the
folds
of
her
habit
o
helen
he
groaned
thou
art
so
beautiful
so
beautiful
that
i
grow
afraid
of
thee
wed
me
this
night
or
in
mercy
let
me
begone
and
now
did
the
duchess
look
down
upon
him
with
eyes
of
wonder
changing
to
a
great
and
tender
joy
and
stooping
put
back
his
mail
coif
with
reverent
hand
and
laid
her
cheek
upon
that
bowed
and
golden
head
beltane
she
whispered
o
beltane
of
mine
now
do
i
know
thee
indeed
for
a
true
man
and
noble
knight
such
love
as
thine
honoureth
us
both
so
beloved
this
night
within
the
hour
shalt
thou
wed
with
me
and
i
joy
to
hear
thee
call
me
wife
therewith
she
turned
and
left
him
there
upon
his
knees
chapter
xxiv
of
what
befell
at
blaen
late
though
the
hour
full
soon
the
manor
was
astir
lights
glimmered
in
the
great
hall
where
were
gathered
all
the
household
of
the
duchess
her
ladies
her
the
porters
and
serving
men
even
to
the
scullions
all
were
there
staring
in
wonderment
upon
the
duchess
who
stood
before
them
upon
the
dais
in
a
rich
habit
of
blue
and
silver
and
with
her
golden
fillet
on
her
brow
good
friends
said
she
looking
round
upon
them
hither
have
i
summoned
ye
for
that
this
night
here
before
you
all
is
my
intent
to
wed
this
noble
knight
beltane
son
of
beltane
duke
of
pentavalon
aforetime
who
shall
henceforth
be
lord
of
me
and
of
mortain
now
did
winfrida
the
fair
start
and
therewith
clench
pink
palms
and
look
upon
my
beltane
noting
in
turn
his
golden
hair
his
belt
of
silver
and
the
great
sword
he
bore
and
biting
her
red
lip
she
stooped
her
beauteous
head
frowning
as
one
in
sudden
perplexity
so
now
spake
on
the
duchess
let
us
to
the
chapel
where
good
father
angelo
shall
give
us
heaven
blessing
upon
this
our
union
lady
said
godric
friar
angelo
was
summoned
to
the
village
this
night
nor
is
he
come
again
yet
then
go
fetch
him
sighed
the
duchess
and
o
godric
hasten
thereafter
turned
she
to
the
assemblage
friends
said
she
since
i
am
greatly
happy
this
night
so
would
i
have
ye
happy
likewise
therefore
i
decree
that
such
as
are
serfs
among
ye
shall
go
free
henceforth
and
to
such
as
are
free
will
i
give
grants
of
land
that
ye
may
come
to
bless
this
night
and
remember
it
ever
but
now
even
as
they
fell
on
their
knees
cries
of
gratitude
and
joyful
acclaim
she
smiling
and
gracious
passed
out
of
the
hall
yet
as
she
went
beckoned
the
lady
winfrida
to
follow
being
come
into
her
chamber
all
three
the
duchess
sank
down
beside
the
open
lattice
and
looked
out
upon
the
garden
all
bathed
in
the
tender
radiance
of
the
moon
anon
she
sighed
and
spake
my
lady
winfrida
on
this
my
wedding
night
a
new
life
dawns
for
mortain
and
for
me
wherein
old
harms
shall
be
forgiven
and
forgot
so
come
kiss
me
winfrida
then
swiftly
came
the
beauteous
winfrida
to
kneel
at
her
lady
feet
to
clasp
her
lady
slender
hand
to
kiss
it
oft
and
bathe
it
in
her
tears
o
sweet
my
lady
am
i
indeed
forgiven
aye
most
truly
am
i
again
thy
loved
companion
and
thy
friend
so
shall
it
be
winfrida
then
o
dear
helen
as
sign
all
is
forgot
and
we
lovers
again
let
us
pledge
each
other
here
and
now
to
thy
future
happiness
and
glory
aye
be
it
so
sighed
the
duchess
bring
wine
for
i
am
athirst
then
turned
she
to
the
lattice
again
and
winfrida
went
lightly
on
her
errand
now
yet
gazing
upon
the
moon
the
duchess
reached
out
and
drew
beltane
beside
her
dear
my
love
she
whispered
in
but
a
little
hour
i
shall
be
thine
art
happy
in
the
thought
nay
she
sighed
white
hands
against
his
mailed
breast
beloved
wait
kiss
me
not
again
until
the
hour
be
passed
lean
here
thy
golden
head
and
look
with
me
upon
the
splendour
of
the
night
see
the
pale
moon
how
placid
and
serene
how
fair
and
stately
she
doth
ride
so
may
thy
life
be
in
coming
years
said
beltane
and
wilt
love
me
ever
beltane
no
matter
what
betide
ever
and
always
so
long
as
thou
art
helen
nay
why
dost
tremble
o
my
lord
see
yonder
that
cloud
how
black
see
how
it
doth
furtive
creep
upon
the
gentle
moon
is
a
long
way
hence
my
helen
yet
will
it
come
ah
think
you
is
a
portent
o
would
the
gentle
angelo
were
here
and
yet
an
he
were
come
methinks
i
might
wish
him
hence
for
that
loving
thee
so
yet
am
i
a
maid
and
foolish
ah
who
is
here
not
angelo
so
soon
what
is
thou
winfrida
welcome
bring
hither
the
goblet
so
came
winfrida
and
falling
on
her
knee
gave
the
goblet
into
her
lady
hand
who
rising
turned
to
beltane
looking
on
him
across
the
brimming
chalice
lord
and
husband
she
breathed
now
do
i
drink
to
thy
glory
in
arms
to
our
future
and
to
our
abiding
love
so
the
duchess
raised
the
goblet
to
her
lips
but
lo
even
as
she
drank
the
thick
black
cloud
began
to
engulf
the
moon
quenching
her
radiant
light
in
its
murky
gloom
so
the
duchess
drank
and
handed
the
goblet
to
beltane
to
thee
my
helen
whom
only
shall
i
love
until
death
and
beyond
then
beltane
drank
also
and
gave
the
cup
to
winfrida
but
even
as
he
did
so
the
duchess
uttered
a
cry
and
pointed
with
hand
o
beltane
the
moon
the
moon
that
was
so
bright
and
glorious
is
gone
the
cloud
hath
blotted
it
out
ah
beltane
what
doth
this
portend
why
do
i
tremble
thus
because
the
moon
is
gone
nay
my
beloved
quoth
beltane
kissing
those
slender
fingers
that
trembled
upon
his
lip
and
were
so
cold
so
deadly
cold
dear
helen
it
will
shine
forth
again
bright
and
radiant
as
ever
yet
why
is
my
heart
so
cold
beltane
and
wherefore
do
i
tremble
the
night
grows
chill
mayhap
nay
this
cold
is
from
within
o
i
would
the
moon
would
shine
nay
let
us
speak
of
our
future
my
helen
the
future
she
sighed
what
doth
it
hold
strife
and
bitter
war
for
thee
and
a
weary
waiting
for
me
and
thou
be
slain
ah
beltane
forgive
these
fears
and
vain
imaginings
indeed
is
most
unlike
me
to
fear
and
tremble
thus
i
was
ever
accounted
brave
until
now
love
think
you
doth
make
me
coward
is
not
death
i
fear
save
for
thy
dear
sake
death
nay
what
have
we
to
do
with
such
thou
and
i
this
is
our
wedding
night
and
yet
i
feel
as
if
this
night
i
were
leading
thee
to
thy
death
o
am
i
mad
forsooth
hold
me
close
beloved
comfort
me
beltane
i
i
am
afraid
then
beltane
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
brought
her
to
the
hearth
and
setting
her
in
the
fireglow
kneeled
there
seeking
to
comfort
her
and
now
he
saw
her
very
pale
sighing
deep
and
oft
and
with
eyes
dilated
and
heavy
beltane
said
she
slowly
i
grow
is
the
fire
methinks
and
smiling
faintly
she
closed
her
eyes
yet
sighed
and
gazed
upon
him
as
one
new
waked
did
i
sleep
she
questioned
drowsily
beltane
she
sighed
speaking
low
and
thick
i
charge
thee
the
future
doth
bring
yet
love
me
alway
or
i
methinks
shall
die
awhile
she
lay
against
him
breathing
deep
and
slow
then
started
of
a
sudden
looking
upon
him
beltane
she
murmured
art
there
beloved
is
dark
and
my
eyes
heavy
methinks
i
must
sleep
awhile
take
me
to
my
women
i
must
sleep
yet
will
i
come
to
thee
soon
soon
beloved
so
beltane
brought
her
to
the
door
but
as
he
came
thither
the
broidered
curtain
was
lifted
and
he
beheld
winfrida
who
ran
to
her
mistress
kissing
her
oft
and
sighing
over
her
winfrida
sighed
the
duchess
slumberous
of
voice
i
grow
i
must
sleep
awhile
aye
overwrought
dear
lady
come
rest
you
until
the
holy
angelo
be
come
so
shalt
be
thine
own
sweet
self
anon
and
when
the
duchess
was
gone
beltane
sat
and
stared
upon
the
fire
and
felt
himself
vaguely
troubled
yet
even
so
as
he
watched
the
leaping
flame
his
head
nodded
and
he
slept
yet
sleeping
dreamed
he
heard
the
duchess
calling
him
and
opening
his
eyes
found
the
fair
winfrida
beside
him
my
lord
beltane
said
she
softly
thy
duchess
biddeth
thee
wait
her
in
the
chapel
follow
me
messire
now
being
yet
heavy
with
sleep
beltane
arose
and
followed
her
through
an
opening
in
the
arras
near
by
and
down
a
narrow
stair
stumbling
often
as
he
went
and
walking
as
one
in
a
dream
so
by
devious
ways
winfrida
brought
him
into
a
little
chapel
where
upon
the
altar
was
a
crucifix
with
candles
in
the
gloom
wait
here
my
lord
said
winfrida
so
will
i
go
prepare
my
lady
friar
angelo
doth
stay
to
do
his
holy
office
so
speaking
winfrida
turned
and
was
gone
then
beltane
came
unto
the
altar
and
kneeling
there
leaned
his
heavy
head
upon
the
fair
white
altar
cloth
and
kneeling
thus
fell
asleep
the
altar
beneath
him
seemed
of
a
sudden
riven
and
split
asunder
and
while
he
gazed
behold
the
fair
white
altar
cloth
grew
fouled
and
stained
with
blood
new
blood
that
splashed
down
red
upon
the
white
even
as
he
watched
then
did
beltane
seek
to
rise
up
from
his
knees
but
a
heavy
weight
bore
him
ever
down
and
hands
huge
and
hairy
gripped
him
fierce
and
strong
but
beholding
these
merciless
hands
a
sudden
mighty
rage
came
upon
beltane
and
struggling
up
he
stood
upon
his
feet
and
drew
sword
but
the
fierce
hands
had
crept
up
to
his
naked
throat
cutting
off
his
breath
the
sword
was
dashed
from
his
loosening
grasp
the
weight
about
him
grew
too
much
for
his
strength
it
bore
him
down
and
down
into
a
pitchy
gloom
where
all
was
very
still
a
wind
sweet
and
cool
breathed
upon
his
cheek
grass
was
below
and
trees
above
him
shadowy
trees
beyond
which
a
pallid
moon
rose
high
very
placid
and
serene
now
as
beltane
stared
heavenward
the
moon
was
blotted
out
a
huge
and
hairy
face
looked
down
in
his
and
hairy
hands
lifted
him
with
mighty
strength
then
beltane
thought
to
see
the
duchess
helen
standing
by
in
her
gown
of
blue
and
silver
helen
he
whispered
but
she
paid
no
heed
busied
in
fastening
about
her
the
nun
long
cloak
that
veiled
her
down
from
head
to
foot
so
the
mighty
arms
that
held
beltane
bore
him
to
a
horse
near
by
and
across
this
horse
he
was
flung
thereafter
the
monster
mounted
also
and
they
moved
off
amid
the
trees
thus
was
beltane
borne
from
blaen
upon
his
wedding
night
dazed
bleeding
and
helpless
in
his
bonds
yet
even
so
ever
as
they
went
he
watched
her
who
rode
near
by
now
in
moonlight
now
in
shadow
so
youthful
and
shapely
but
with
hood
drawn
low
as
she
had
worn
it
when
he
bore
her
through
the
forest
in
his
arms
and
ever
as
they
went
he
watched
the
pale
gleam
of
her
hand
upon
the
bridle
or
her
little
foot
in
its
embroidered
shoe
or
the
fold
of
her
blue
gown
with
its
silver
and
ever
the
trouble
in
his
dazed
brain
grew
the
deeper
once
as
they
crossed
a
broad
glade
she
rode
up
close
beside
him
and
beneath
her
hood
he
saw
a
strand
of
her
glorious
hair
bright
under
the
moon
then
did
he
writhe
and
struggle
in
his
bonds
helen
he
cried
o
helen
but
a
great
hand
coarse
and
hairy
came
upon
his
mouth
stopping
the
cry
and
choking
him
to
silence
so
they
bore
my
beltane
southwards
through
the
misty
woods
on
and
ever
on
till
with
the
dawn
they
were
come
to
a
castle
great
and
very
strong
where
battlement
and
tower
frowned
upon
the
paling
stars
but
with
the
dawn
the
gloom
of
the
little
chapel
of
blaen
came
one
who
stood
haggard
and
pallid
as
the
dawn
to
stare
upon
a
great
sword
and
upon
a
torn
and
and
so
gazing
she
shrank
away
back
and
back
crouching
down
amid
the
gloom
when
at
last
the
sun
arose
it
glittered
on
a
long
broad
blade
across
which
upon
the
rough
pavement
lay
one
very
silent
and
very
still
amid
the
tumbled
glory
of
her
hair
chapter
xxv
how
beltane
became
captive
to
sir
pertolepe
a
horn
lustily
winded
waked
my
beltane
from
his
swoon
waked
him
to
a
glimmering
world
vague
and
unreal
where
lights
flared
and
voices
sounded
hoarse
and
faint
in
question
and
answer
thereafter
down
rattled
drawbridge
and
up
creaked
portcullis
and
so
riding
a
deep
and
gloomy
arch
they
came
out
into
a
courtyard
where
were
many
vague
forms
that
flitted
to
and
fro
and
many
more
lights
that
glinted
on
steel
bascinet
and
hauberk
of
mail
now
as
beltane
lay
helpless
in
his
bonds
he
felt
a
hand
among
his
hair
a
strong
hand
that
lifted
his
heavy
drooping
head
and
turned
up
his
face
to
the
glare
of
the
torches
how
now
fool
cried
a
gruff
voice
here
not
thy
meat
ha
what
would
ye
what
would
ye
fool
look
upon
another
fool
for
fool
forsooth
is
he
methinks
that
cometh
so
into
garthlaxton
keep
now
hereupon
opening
unwilling
eyes
beltane
looked
up
into
the
face
of
beda
the
jester
that
bent
above
him
with
a
ring
of
faces
beyond
aha
quoth
the
jester
clapping
beltane
pale
and
bloody
cheek
here
is
a
fool
indeed
forsooth
a
very
foolish
fool
hither
come
through
folly
for
being
great
of
body
and
small
of
wit
look
you
his
folly
hath
hither
brought
him
in
shape
of
a
hairy
fool
ape
growled
a
voice
and
the
jester
was
seized
in
a
hairy
hand
and
shaken
till
his
bells
jingled
and
now
beltane
beheld
his
captor
a
gnarled
and
crooked
creature
yet
huge
of
head
and
with
the
mighty
arms
and
shoulders
of
a
giant
a
fierce
hairy
monster
whose
hideousness
was
set
off
by
the
richness
of
his
vesture
ape
quotha
he
growled
dare
ye
name
ulf
the
strong
ape
forsooth
ha
so
will
i
shake
the
flesh
from
thy
bones
but
now
she
who
sat
her
horse
near
by
so
proud
and
stately
reached
forth
a
white
hand
touching
ulf
the
strong
upon
the
arm
and
lo
in
that
moment
he
loosed
the
breathless
jester
and
spake
with
bowed
head
dear
my
lady
i
forgot
then
turning
to
the
grinning
soldiery
he
scowled
upon
them
dogs
quoth
he
go
to

say

behold

beltane
son
of
beltane
the
strong
heretofore
duke
of
pentavalon
now
hereupon
arose
a
mighty
turmoil
and
excitement
all
men
striving
to
behold
beltane
to
touch
him
and
look
upon
his
drooping
face
but
mighty
hand
held
them
back
one
and
all
and
presently
came
hasting
divers
esquires
and
knights
who
beholding
beltane
his
costly
mail
his
silver
belt
and
golden
hair
seized
upon
him
right
joyfully
and
bore
him
into
an
inner
ward
and
threw
him
down
upon
the
floor
marvelling
and
rejoicing
over
him
while
beltane
lay
there
fast
bound
and
helpless
staring
up
with
frowning
brow
as
one
that
strives
to
think
yet
can
not
now
suddenly
the
noise
about
him
ceased
all
voices
were
hushed
and
he
was
aware
of
one
who
stood
near
by
a
doleful
figure
swathed
in
bandages
who
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
a
tall
esquire
and
looking
upon
this
figure
he
saw
it
was
sir
pertolepe
the
red
ha
by
the
eyes
of
god
quoth
sir
pertolepe
is
he
himself
o
sweet
sight
see
i
grow
better
already
who
brought
him
say
you
lord
was
the
duchess
helen
said
one
helen
cried
sir
pertolepe
helen
of
mortain
aye
lord
as
her
wedding
gift
to
our
lord
duke
ivo
now
hereupon
beltane
staring
eyes
closed
the
great
muscles
of
his
body
twitched
and
writhed
and
stood
out
gnarled
and
rigid
awhile
then
he
sighed
a
slow
hissing
breath
and
lay
there
staring
up
at
the
vaulted
roof
again
came
she
herself
raoul
aye
good
my
lord
why
then
admit
her
god
love
messires
would
ye
keep
the
glorious
helen
without
lord
she
is
gone
she
and
her
both
gone
gone
forsooth
is
strange
and
yet
is
like
the
wilful
helen
yet
hath
she
left
her
wedding
gift
in
my
keeping
o
a
rare
gift
a
worthy
gift
and
most
acceptable
strip
me
off
his
armour
yet
no
as
he
came
so
shall
he
bide
until
my
lord
duke
be
come
bring
now
shackles
strong
and
heavy
bring
fetters
and
rivets
so
will
i
sit
here
and
see
him
trussed
and
presently
came
two
armourers
with
hammers
and
rivets
and
shackled
beltane
with
heavy
chains
the
while
sir
pertolepe
sitting
near
laughed
and
spake
him
right
jovially
but
beltane
suffered
it
all
uttering
no
word
and
staring
ever
straight
before
him
with
wide
vague
eyes
knitting
his
brow
ever
and
anon
in
troubled
amaze
like
a
child
that
suffers
unjustly
wherefore
sir
pertolepe
fondling
his
big
chin
frowned
ha
quoth
he
let
our
duke
that
hath
no
duchy
be
lodged
secure
to
the
dungeons
aye
he
shall
sleep
with
rats
until
my
lord
duke
ivo
come
to
see
him
die
yet
stay
the
dungeons
be
apt
to
sap
a
man
strength
and
spirit
and
to
a
weak
man
death
cometh
over
soon
and
easy
let
him
lie
soft
feed
full
and
sleep
sound
let
him
have
air
and
light
so
shall
he
wax
fat
and
lusty
against
my
lord
duke
coming
see
to
it
tristan
so
they
led
beltane
away
jangling
in
his
fetters
across
divers
courtyards
and
up
a
narrow
winding
stair
and
thrust
him
within
a
chamber
where
was
a
bed
and
above
it
a
that
looked
out
across
a
stretch
of
rolling
wooded
country
now
being
come
to
the
bed
beltane
sank
down
thereon
and
setting
elbow
to
knee
rested
his
heavy
head
upon
his
hand
as
one
that
fain
would
think
helen
he
whispered
and
so
whispering
his
strong
fingers
writhed
and
clenched
themselves
within
his
yellow
hair
and
thus
sat
he
all
that
day
bowed
forward
upon
his
hand
his
fingers
within
his
hair
staring
ever
at
the
square
flagstone
beneath
his
foot
heedless
alike
of
the
coming
and
going
of
his
gaoler
or
of
the
food
set
out
upon
the
bench
hard
by
day
grew
to
evening
and
evening
to
night
yet
still
he
sat
there
mighty
shoulders
bowed
forward
iron
fingers
clenched
within
his
hair
like
one
that
is
dead
in
so
much
that
his
gaoler
setting
down
food
beside
the
other
untasted
dishes
looked
upon
him
in
amaze
and
touched
him
oho
said
he
wake
up
here
be
food
look
ye
and
by
saint
crispin
rich
and
dainty
and
drink
good
wine
wake
and
eat
then
beltane
clutching
fingers
relaxed
and
he
raised
his
head
blinking
in
the
rays
of
the
lanthorn
and
looking
upon
his
rumpled
hair
the
gaoler
stared
and
peered
more
close
quoth
he
methought
thou
wert
a
golden
man
yet
art
silver
also
meseemeth
fellow
said
beltane
and
slow
troy
town
was
burned
and
here
was
great
pity
methinks
for
was
a
fair
city
yet
to
weep
it
these
days
were
a
fond
madness
come
let
us
eat
but
as
beltane
uprose
in
his
jangling
fetters
the
gaoler
beholding
his
face
backed
to
the
door
and
slamming
it
shut
barred
and
fast
bolted
it
yet
cast
full
many
a
glance
behind
as
he
hasted
down
the
winding
stair
then
beltane
ate
and
drank
and
thereafter
threw
himself
upon
his
narrow
couch
but
his
fetters
jangled
often
in
the
dark
thus
as
he
lay
staring
upwards
into
the
gloom
he
was
aware
of
the
opening
of
the
door
and
beheld
his
gaoler
bearing
a
lanthorn
and
behind
him
sir
pertolepe
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
favourite
esquire
who
coming
near
looked
upon
beltane
nodding
right
jovially
messire
beltane
quoth
he
thou
dare
set
up
thyself
against
ivo
our
lord
the
duke
o
fool
is
said
thou
hast
sworn
to
drive
him
forth
of
pentavalon
seeking
her
to
wife
o
fool
of
fools
think
presumptuous
rogue
that
she
the
glorious
helen
that
helen
the
beautiful
whom
all
men
desire
would
stoop
to
thee
an
outcast
wolf
head
and
outlaw
that
thou
art
dare
think
so
forsooth
belike
my
lord
duke
shall
come
and
mayhap
shall
bring
the
duchess
helen
in
his
train
to
look
upon
the
manner
of
thy
dying
now
hereupon
up
started
beltane
that
his
fetters
clashed
and
laughed
so
sudden
so
fierce
and
harsh
that
raoul
the
esquire
clapped
hand
to
dagger
and
even
red
pertolepe
started
sweet
lord
quoth
beltane
noble
messire
pertolepe
of
thy
boundless
mercy
of
thy
tender
ruth
grant
unto
me
this
boon
when
ye
shall
have
done
me
to
death
cut
off
this
head
of
mine
and
send
it
to
helen
to
helen
the
beautiful
the
wilful
in
memory
of
what
befell
at
blaen
chapter
xxvi
of
the
horrors
of
garthlaxton
keep
and
how
a
devil
entered
into
beltane
six
days
came
and
went
and
during
all
this
time
beltane
spake
word
to
no
man
every
evening
came
sir
pertolepe
leaning
on
the
arm
of
raoul
the
esquire
to
view
his
prisoner
with
greedy
eyes
and
ply
him
with
jovial
talk
whiles
beltane
would
lie
frowning
up
at
the
mighty
or
sit
elbows
on
knee
his
fingers
clenched
upon
that
lock
of
hair
that
gleamed
so
strangely
white
amid
the
yellow
now
upon
the
seventh
evening
as
he
sat
thus
came
sir
pertolepe
according
to
his
wont
but
he
leaned
upon
the
shoulder
of
beda
the
jester
whose
motley
flared
rugged
wall
and
dingy
flagstone
and
whose
bells
rang
loud
and
merry
by
contrast
with
the
gloom
quoth
sir
pertolepe
seated
upon
the
bench
and
smiling
upon
grim
figure
he
groweth
fat
to
the
killing
seest
thou
my
beda
a
young
man
and
hearty
very
hale
and
strong
and
therefore
meet
for
death
so
strong
a
man
should
be
long
time
an
death
be
coaxed
and
managed
well
and
tristan
is
more
cunning
and
hath
more
love
for
his
craft
than
ever
had
black
roger
with
care
beda
i
say
with
care
messire
beltane
should
die
from
dawn
to
sundown
alack
sighed
the
jester
death
shall
take
him
over
soon
as
thou
dost
say
and
there
the
pity
o
soon
fool
soon
now
out
upon
thee
for
a
fool
ingrain
forsooth
sweet
lord
fool
am
i
mark
these
bells
yet
thou
art
a
greater
how
sirrah
in
that
thou
art
a
greater
man
fair
sweet
lord
greater
in
might
greater
in
body
and
greater
in
folly
ha
mock
me
knave
for
perceive
me
fair
and
gentle
lord
as
this
base
body
of
ours
being
altogether
thing
material
is
also
thing
corruptible
so
is
it
also
a
thing
finite
and
as
it
is
a
thing
finite
so
are
its
sensations
be
they
of
pleasure
or
pain
finite
also
therefore
soon
must
end
now
upon
the
other
hand
how
now
what
babbling
folly
is
here
as
i
say
most
potent
lord
upon
the
other
hand
as
the
mind
being
altogether
thing
transcendental
is
also
thing
incorruptible
so
is
it
also
a
thing
infinite
and
being
a
thing
infinite
so
are
its
sensations
infinite
also
therefore
everlasting
ha
there
reason
in
thy
folly
methinks
what
more
bethink
thee
lord
there
be
divers
rogues
who
having
provoked
thy
potent
anger
do
lie
even
now
awaiting
thy
lordly
pleasure
now
irons
be
heating
for
them
moreover
they
are
by
thy
will
to
suffer
the
grievous
torment
of
the
pulleys
and
the
wheel
and
these
as
i
do
know
be
sharp
punishments
and
apt
to
cause
prodigious
outcry
now
to
hear
one
cry
out
beneath
the
torture
is
an
evil
thing
for
youthful
ears
and
one
not
soon
forgot
aye
aye
forsooth
i
begin
to
see
thy
meaning
good
fool
yet
say
on
let
this
thy
prisoner
be
set
within
the
cell
above
the
torture
chamber
so
lying
within
the
dark
he
must
needs
hear
them
cry
below
and
in
his
mind
shall
he
suffer
as
they
suffer
every
pang
of
racking
wheel
and
searing
iron
and
because
the
mind
is
thing
infinite
enough
enough
o
most
excellent
beda
is
well
bethought
o
rare
fool
so
shall
it
be
forthwith
sir
pertolepe
summoned
certain
of
his
guard
and
incontinent
beltane
was
dragged
the
winding
stair
and
thereafter
fast
shut
within
a
place
of
gloom
a
narrow
cell
breathing
an
air
close
and
heavy
and
void
of
all
light
therefore
beltane
sat
him
down
on
the
floor
his
back
to
the
wall
staring
upon
the
dark
chin
on
fist
long
he
sat
thus
stirring
not
and
in
his
heart
a
black
void
deeper
and
more
awful
than
the
fetid
gloom
of
any
dungeon
a
void
wherein
a
new
beltane
came
into
being
now
presently
as
he
sat
thus
upon
the
silence
stole
a
sound
low
and
murmurous
that
rose
and
fell
yet
never
quite
died
away
and
beltane
knowing
what
sound
this
was
clenched
his
hands
and
bowed
his
face
upon
his
knees
as
he
listened
this
drone
grew
to
a
sudden
squealing
cry
that
rang
and
echoed
from
wall
to
wall
whiles
beltane
crouched
in
that
place
of
horror
felt
the
sweat
start
out
upon
him
yet
shivered
as
with
deadly
cold
and
ever
the
cries
thrilled
within
the
dark
or
sank
to
whimpering
moans
and
stifled
supplications
and
ever
beltane
hearkened
to
these
fell
sounds
staring
blindly
into
the
gloom
and
ever
the
new
beltane
grew
the
stronger
within
him
hour
after
hour
he
crouched
thus
so
very
silent
so
very
quiet
so
very
still
but
long
after
the
groans
and
wailings
had
died
to
silence
beltane
stared
into
the
gloom
and
gnawed
upon
his
fingers
of
a
sudden
he
espied
a
glowing
spark
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
to
the
right
very
small
yet
very
bright
now
as
he
watched
behold
the
spark
changed
to
a
line
of
golden
light
so
that
his
eyes
ached
and
he
was
fain
to
shade
them
in
his
shackled
arm
and
thus
he
beheld
a
flagstone
that
seemed
to
lift
itself
with
infinite
caution
and
thereafter
a
voice
breathed
his
name
messire
messire
beltane
and
now
through
the
hole
in
the
floor
behold
a
hand
bearing
a
lanthorn
an
arm
a
shoulder
a
shrouded
head
thus
slowly
a
tall
cloaked
figure
rose
up
through
the
floor
and
setting
down
the
lanthorn
leaned
toward
beltane
putting
back
the
hood
of
his
mantle
and
beltane
beheld
beda
the
jester
art
awake
messire
beltane
aye
quoth
beltane
lifting
his
head
and
i
have
used
mine
ears
the
wheel
and
the
pulley
are
rare
begetters
of
groans
as
thou
foretell
fool
was
a
good
thought
to
drag
me
hither
it
needed
but
this
now
am
i
steel
without
and
within
o
is
a
foul
world
nay
messire
is
a
fair
world
wherein
be
foul
things
they
call
them
as
to
me
i
am
but
a
fool
mark
this
motley
yet
hither
i
caused
thee
to
be
dragged
that
i
might
save
those
limbs
o
thine
from
wheel
and
pulley
from
flame
and
gibbet
and
set
thee
free
within
a
world
which
i
do
hold
a
fair
world
yet
first
those
fetters
behold
hammer
and
chisel
oswin
thy
gaoler
sleepeth
as
sweet
as
a
babe
and
wherefore
for
that
i
decocted
lethe
in
his
cup
likewise
the
guard
below
my
father
that
lived
here
before
me
and
died
of
a
jest
out
of
season
was
skilled
in
herbs
and
i
am
his
son
my
father
that
bled
out
his
life
my
lord
supper
table
knew
divers
secret
ways
within
the
thickness
of
these
walls
so
do
i
know
more
of
castle
than
doth
pertolepe
himself
come
reach
hither
thy
shackles
and
i
will
cut
them
off
a
chisel
is
swifter
than
a
file
and
why
give
me
life
fool
for
that
is
a
useful
thing
messire
and
perchance
as
sweet
to
thee
this
night
within
thy
dungeon
as
to
me
upon
a
certain
day
within
the
green
that
you
may
wot
of
so
speaking
beda
the
jester
cut
asunder
the
chain
that
bound
the
fetters
and
beltane
arose
and
stretched
himself
and
the
manacles
gleamed
on
each
wrist
quoth
he
what
now
whereat
the
jester
sitting
upon
the
floor
looked
up
at
him
and
spake
on
this
wise
two
days
agone
as
i
walked
me
in
the
green
dreaming
such
foolish
dreams
as
a
fool
may
there
came
very
suddenly
a
sorry
wight
a
wild
man
very
ragged
who
set
me
his
ragged
arm
about
my
neck
and
a
sharp
dagger
to
my
throat
and
thus
looking
him
within
the
eyes
i
knew
him
for
that
same
roger
from
whose
hand
thou
save
me
aforetime
says
he
am
he
that
hanged
and
tortured
men
at
my
bidding
i
am
roger
and
my
sins
be
many
prithee
says
i
roger
add
not
another
to
thy
sins
by
cutting
the
throat
of
a
fool
must
i
says
he
dolorous
of
voice
thou
dost
answer
me
two
questions
i
will
answer
thee
two
hundred
an
thou
leave
my
throat
unslit
says
i
two
says
roger
sighing
doth
pertolepe
hold
him
i
seek
says
i
they
call
beltane
says
roger
he
lie
prisoned
within
garthlaxton
doth
quoth
i
now
for
thine
other
question
tis
this
says
roger
aid
us
to
win
him
free
look
ye
roger
says
i
tis
only
a
fool
that
seeketh
aid
of
a
fool
and
fool
am
i
says
roger
thou
art
a
live
fool
promise
therefore
or
wilt
be
naught
but
a
dead
fool
says
i
once
try
to
slay
me
in
the
green
ere
now
says
roger
my
lord
beltane
saved
thy
carcass
and
my
soul
quoth
i
a
fool
can
repay
so
was
i
but
now
dreaming
here
within
this
boskage
how
i
might
perchance
win
this
same
beltane
to
life
without
thy
scurvy
aid
black
roger
moreover
methinks
i
know
a
way
and
thou
spare
me
life
to
do
it
forsooth
says
roger
putting
away
his
dagger
wert
ever
a
fool
of
thy
word
beda
so
now
do
i
spare
thy
life
and
sparing
it
i
save
it
and
thus
do
i
cut
another
accursed
notch
from
my
belt
then
says
i
night
be
at
the
riven
oak
by
brankton
thicket
an
hour
before
dawn
be
it
beda
says
he
and
so
i
left
him
cutting
at
his
belt
and
lo
am
i
here
and
within
an
hour
it
should
be
dawn
follow
messire
so
saying
beda
rose
and
taking
the
lanthorn
began
to
descend
through
the
floor
having
first
shown
how
the
flagstone
must
be
lowered
in
place
thereafter
beltane
followed
the
jester
down
a
narrow
stair
built
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
and
along
a
passage
that
ended
abruptly
nor
could
beltane
see
any
sign
of
door
in
the
solid
masonry
that
barred
their
way
here
beda
paused
finger
on
lip
and
extinguished
the
lanthorn
then
in
the
dark
a
hinge
creaked
faintly
a
quivering
hand
seized
beltane
manacled
wrist
drawing
him
on
and
through
a
narrow
opening
that
yawned
suddenly
before
them
thereafter
the
hinge
creaked
again
and
they
stood
side
by
side
within
a
small
chamber
where
was
a
doorway
hung
across
with
heavy
curtains
beyond
which
a
light
burned
now
even
as
beltane
looked
thitherward
he
heard
the
rattle
of
dice
and
a
sleepy
voice
that
cursed
drowsily
and
shaking
off
the
clutching
desperate
fingers
that
strove
to
stay
him
he
came
and
peered
through
the
curtains
thus
he
beheld
two
men
that
faced
each
other
across
a
table
whereon
was
wine
with
dice
and
store
of
money
and
as
they
played
these
men
yawned
leaning
heavily
upon
the
table
back
swept
the
curtains
and
striding
into
the
room
beltane
stared
upon
these
men
who
yet
leaning
upon
the
table
stared
back
at
him
but
beholding
the
look
in
his
blue
eyes
and
the
smile
that
curled
his
mouth
they
stumbled
to
their
feet
and
sought
to
draw
weapon
then
beltane
sprang
and
caught
them
each
about
the
neck
and
swinging
them
smote
their
heads
together
and
together
these
men
sank
in
his
grasp
and
lay
in
a
twisted
huddle
across
the
table
among
the
spilled
wine
a
coin
rang
upon
the
stone
floor
rolled
into
a
distant
corner
and
came
to
rest
the
jester
gasped
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtains
and
so
came
silence
broke
only
by
the
soft
drip
drip
of
the
spilled
wine
o
mercy
of
god
whispered
the
jester
hoarsely
at
last
what
need
was
there
for
this
they
would
have
slept
aye
smiled
beltane
but
not
so
soundly
as
now
methinks
come
let
us
go
silently
the
jester
went
on
before
by
narrow
that
writhed
and
twisted
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
up
sudden
flights
of
steps
until
at
length
they
came
out
upon
a
parapet
whose
grim
battlements
scowled
high
in
air
but
as
they
hasted
on
flitting
pallid
moon
the
jester
of
a
sudden
stopped
and
turning
dragged
beltane
into
the
shadows
for
upon
the
silence
came
the
sound
of
mailed
feet
pacing
near
now
once
again
beltane
brake
from
the
jester
clutching
fingers
and
striding
forward
came
face
to
face
with
one
that
bare
a
pike
on
mailed
shoulder
and
who
beholding
beltane
halted
to
peer
at
him
with
head
quoth
he
ha
stand
stand
i
say
and
speak
me
who
thou
art
then
beltane
laughed
softly
said
he
o
fool
not
to
know
i
am
death
and
with
the
word
he
leapt
came
a
cry
muffled
in
a
mighty
hand
a
grappling
fierce
yet
silent
and
beda
cowering
back
beheld
beltane
swing
a
writhing
body
high
in
air
and
hurl
it
far
out
over
the
battlements
thereafter
above
the
soft
rustle
of
the
a
sound
far
below
a
faint
splash
and
beda
the
jester
shivering
in
the
night
wind
shrank
deeper
into
the
gloom
and
made
a
swift
motion
as
though
for
all
his
folly
he
had
crossed
himself
then
came
beltane
the
smile
still
twisting
his
mouth
quoth
he
forsooth
my
strength
is
come
back
again
be
there
any
more
that
i
may
deal
withal
good
fool
lord
whispered
the
shivering
jester
methinks
i
smell
the
dawn
come
so
beltane
followed
him
from
the
battlements
down
winding
stairs
through
halls
that
whispered
in
the
dark
down
more
stairs
down
and
ever
down
walls
slimy
to
the
touch
through
a
gloom
heavy
with
mildew
and
decay
on
sped
the
jester
staying
not
to
light
the
lanthorn
nor
once
touching
nor
once
turning
with
helping
hand
to
guide
beltane
stumbling
after
in
the
dark
then
at
last
deep
in
the
clammy
earth
they
reached
a
door
a
small
door
whose
rusted
iron
was
handed
with
mighty
clamps
of
rusted
iron
here
the
jester
paused
to
fit
key
to
lock
to
strain
and
pant
awhile
ere
bolts
shrieked
and
turned
and
the
door
yawned
open
then
stooping
he
struck
flint
and
steel
and
in
a
while
had
lit
the
lanthorn
and
looking
upon
beltane
with
eyes
that
stared
in
the
pallor
of
his
face
he
pointed
toward
the
yawning
tunnel
messire
said
he
yonder
lieth
thy
way
to
life
and
the
world
as
thou
give
me
life
so
do
i
give
thee
thine
thou
wert
as
i
remember
thee
a
very
gentle
tender
youth
are
three
dead
without
reason
reason
good
fool
said
beltane
thou
see
me
borne
in
a
prisoner
to
garthlaxton
now
tell
me
i
pray
who
was
she
that
rode
with
us
was
the
duchess
helen
of
mortain
messire
i
saw
her
hair
moreover
but
lo
even
as
the
jester
spake
beltane
turned
and
striding
down
the
tunnel
was
swallowed
in
the
dark
chapter
xxvii
how
beltane
took
to
the
a
faint
glimmer
growing
ever
brighter
a
jagged
patch
of
pale
sky
a
cleft
in
the
rock
with
bush
and
creeping
vines
this
beltane
saw
ere
he
stepped
out
into
the
cool
sweet
air
of
dawn
a
while
he
stood
to
stare
up
at
the
sky
where
yet
a
few
stars
showed
paling
to
the
day
and
to
drink
in
mighty
breaths
of
the
fragrant
air
and
thus
plain
to
his
ears
stole
the
ripple
of
running
water
hard
by
and
going
thitherward
he
stripped
and
naked
came
down
to
the
stream
where
was
a
misty
pool
and
plunged
him
therein
now
as
he
bathed
him
thus
gasping
somewhat
because
of
the
cold
yet
glorying
in
the
rush
and
tingle
of
his
blood
behold
the
leaves
parted
near
by
and
uprising
in
his
naked
might
beltane
beheld
the
face
of
one
that
watched
him
intently
master
cried
a
voice
harsh
but
very
joyful
o
dear
my
lord
and
roger
sprang
down
the
bank
and
heedless
of
the
water
plunged
in
to
catch
beltane
hands
and
kiss
them
master
he
cried
and
thus
it
was
these
two
met
again
and
presently
having
donned
clothes
and
harness
beltane
sat
down
him
beside
the
brook
head
upon
hand
staring
at
the
water
whiles
roger
sitting
near
watched
him
in
a
silent
ecstasy
whence
come
ye
roger
from
lord
ho
a
mighty
place

and

bourne
roger
and
so
fare
thee
well
now
as
he
spake
beltane
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
along
beside
the
brook
but
even
as
he
went
so
went
roger
whereon
beltane
turned
frowning
quoth
he
roger
thrasfordham
lieth
behind
thee
aye
master
but
death
lieth
before
thee
why
then
death
will
i
face
alone
roger
nay
master
not
while
roger
live
thy
man
am
i
ha
wilt
withstand
me
black
roger
thy
man
am
i
to
follow
thee
in
life
and
go
down
with
thee
in
death
now
hereupon
beltane
came
close
and
in
the
dim
light
black
roger
beheld
the
new
beltane
glaring
down
at
him
and
with
great
mailed
fist
clenched
to
smite
but
even
so
black
roger
gave
not
back
only
he
drew
dagger
and
strove
to
set
it
in
beltane
iron
fingers
take
this
quoth
he
for
an
ye
would
be
free
of
roger
first
must
ye
slay
him
master
so
beltane
took
the
dagger
and
fumbled
with
it
awhile
then
gave
it
back
to
roger
hand
roger
muttered
he
his
hand
upon
his
brow
my
faithful
roger
so
men
can
be
faithful
saying
which
he
sighed
a
long
hissing
breath
and
hid
his
face
within
his
mittened
hand
and
turning
strode
swiftly
upon
his
way
now
in
a
while
they
being
come
into
the
forest
roger
touched
him
on
the
arm
master
said
he
whither
do
ye
go
nay
it
mattereth
not
so
long
as
i
can
lie
hid
a
while
for
i
must
sleep
roger
then
can
i
bring
thee
to
a
place
where
none
shall
ever
find
thee
come
master
so
saying
roger
turned
aside
into
the
denser
wood
bursting
a
way
through
a
tangle
of
brush
plunging
ever
deeper
into
the
wild
until
they
came
to
a
place
where
great
rocks
and
boulders
jutted
up
amid
the
green
and
the
trees
grew
scant
day
was
breaking
and
before
them
in
the
pale
light
rose
a
steep
cliff
whose
jagged
outline
clothed
here
and
there
with
brush
and
vines
loomed
up
before
them
barring
their
advance
but
at
the
foot
of
this
cliff
grew
a
tree
gnarled
and
stunted
the
which
as
beltane
watched
black
roger
began
to
climb
until
being
some
ten
feet
from
the
ground
he
reaching
out
and
seizing
a
thick
vine
that
grew
upon
the
rock
stepped
from
the
tree
and
vanished
into
the
face
of
the
cliff
but
in
a
moment
the
leaves
were
parted
and
roger
looked
forth
beckoning
beltane
to
follow
so
having
climbed
the
tree
beltane
in
turn
seized
hold
upon
the
vine
and
stumbling
amid
the
leaves
found
himself
on
his
knees
within
a
small
cave
where
hand
met
his
thereafter
roger
led
him
to
the
end
of
the
cavern
where
was
a
winding
passage
very
rough
and
narrow
that
brought
them
to
a
second
and
larger
cave
as
beltane
judged
for
in
the
dark
his
hands
could
feel
nought
but
space
here
roger
halted
and
whistled
three
times
a
melodious
call
that
woke
many
a
slumbering
echo
and
in
a
while
behold
a
glow
that
grew
ever
brighter
until
of
a
sudden
a
man
appeared
bearing
a
flaming
that
showed
a
wide
cave
whose
rugged
roof
and
walls
glistened
here
and
there
and
whose
rocky
floor
ended
abruptly
in
a
yawning
gulf
from
whose
black
depths
came
soft
murmurs
and
ripplings
of
water
far
below
now
halting
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
chasm
the
man
lifted
his
flaming
torch
and
lo
it
was
walkyn
who
beholding
beltane
in
his
mail
uttered
a
hoarse
shout
of
welcome
and
stooping
thrust
a
plank
across
the
gulf
so
beltane
crossed
the
plank
and
gave
his
hand
to
walkyn
iron
grip
and
thereafter
followed
him
along
winding
hollowed
within
the
rock
until
they
came
to
a
cavern
where
a
fire
blazed
whose
red
light
danced
upon
battered
bascinets
and
polished
blades
that
hung
against
the
wall
while
in
one
corner
upon
a
bed
of
fern
giles
o
the
bow
lay
snoring
right
blissfully
to
him
went
roger
to
shake
him
into
groaning
wakefulness
and
to
point
with
eager
finger
to
beltane
whereat
up
sprang
giles
and
came
running
with
hands
outstretched
in
welcome
yet
of
a
sudden
paused
and
stood
staring
upon
beltane
as
did
the
others
also
for
the
place
was
very
bright
and
moreover
beltane
was
fallen
back
so
they
looked
on
him
all
three
yet
spake
no
word
therefore
beltane
sat
him
down
beside
the
fire
and
rested
his
head
upon
his
hands
as
one
that
is
weary
sitting
thus
he
told
them
briefly
what
had
chanced
but
of
the
duchess
he
said
nothing
and
in
a
while
lifting
his
head
he
saw
them
watching
him
all
three
and
all
three
incontinent
glanced
otherwhere
quoth
beltane
wherefore
do
ye
stare
upon
me
why
as
to
that
good
brother
said
the
archer
is
but
that
that
we
do
think
thee
something
changed
of
aspect
changed
said
beltane
and
laughed
short
and
bitter
aye
is
like
i
am
lord
quoth
walkyn
clenching
mighty
fists
have
they
tormented
thee
was
it
the
torture
lord
aye
nodded
beltane
was
the
torture
so
now
good
comrades
here
will
i
sleep
awhile
but
first
go
forth
with
the
sun
and
question
all
ye
may
of
ivo
and
his
doings
where
he
doth
lie
and
where
his
forces
muster
hear
all
ye
can
and
bring
me
word
for
methinks
we
shall
be
busy
again
anon
then
throwing
himself
upon
the
bed
of
fern
that
roger
had
beltane
presently
fell
asleep
and
while
he
slept
came
the
three
very
silent
and
treading
very
soft
to
look
down
upon
his
sleeping
face
and
the
manacles
that
gleamed
upon
his
wrists
and
behold
even
as
he
slept
he
groaned
and
writhed
his
tender
lips
grown
fierce
a
relentless
line
his
jaws
grim
set
and
between
his
frowning
brows
a
lock
of
silky
hair
that
gleamed
among
the
yellow
the
torture
growled
roger
and
so
soft
as
they
came
the
three
turned
and
left
him
to
his
slumber
but
oft
he
moaned
and
once
he
spake
a
word
sudden
and
fierce
clenched
teeth
and
the
word
was
helen
chapter
xxviii
of
the
place
of
refuge
within
the
green
it
was
toward
evening
that
beltane
awoke
and
sitting
up
looked
about
him
he
was
in
a
chamber
roughly
square
a
hollow
within
the
rock
part
natural
and
part
hewn
by
hand
a
commodious
chamber
lighted
by
a
jagged
hole
in
the
rock
above
a
fissure
all
with
vines
and
creeping
plants
whose
luxuriant
foliage
tempered
the
sun
rays
to
a
tender
green
twilight
very
grateful
and
pleasant
now
pendant
from
the
opening
was
a
ladder
of
cords
and
upon
this
ladder
just
beneath
the
cleft
beltane
beheld
a
pair
of
lusty
legs
in
boots
of
untanned
leather
laced
up
with
leathern
thongs
as
for
their
owner
he
was
hidden
quite
by
reason
of
the
leafy
screen
as
he
leaned
forth
of
the
fissure
looking
upon
these
legs
beltane
knew
them
by
their
very
attitude
for
the
legs
of
one
who
watched
intently
but
while
he
looked
they
stirred
shifted
and
growing
lax
became
the
legs
of
one
who
lounged
then
slow
and
lazily
they
began
to
descend
lower
and
lower
until
the
brown
comely
face
of
giles
brabblecombe
o
the
hills
smiled
down
upon
beltane
with
a
gleam
of
white
teeth
cried
he
hail
noble
brother
and
likewise
the
good
god
bless
thee
hast
slept
well
it
lacketh
scarce
an
hour
to
sundown
and
therefore
eat
well
how
say
ye
now
to
a
toothsome
haunch
o
cold
venison
in
faith
cunningly
cooked
and
sufficiently
salted
and
seasoned
ha
and
mark
me
with
a
mouthful
of
malmsey
ripely
rare
oho
rich
wine
that
i
filched
from
a
fatuous
friar
within
the
green
forsooth
tall
brother
is
a
wondrous
place
the
greenwood
wherein
a
man
shall
come
by
all
he
doth
need
an
he
seek
far
enough
thus
an
my
purse
be
empty
your
beefy
burgher
shall
by
dint
of
gentle
coaxing
haste
to
fill
me
it
with
good
broad
pieces
but
an
my
emptiness
be
of
the
belly
then
sweet
saint
giles
send
me
some
ambulating
abbot
or
prior
for
your
churchmen
do
ever
ride
with
well
lined
as
i
do
know
having
been
bred
a
monk
and
therefore
with
a
rare
lust
to
creature
comforts
now
while
he
spake
thus
the
archer
was
busily
setting
forth
the
viands
upon
a
rough
table
that
stood
hard
by
what
time
beltane
looked
about
him
is
a
wondrous
this
giles
quoth
he
aye
verily
brother
a
sweet
place
for
hunted
men
such
as
we
here
be
caves
and
caverns
enow
to
hide
an
army
and
rocky
narrow
and
winding
i
the
dark
where
we
four
might
hold
all
black
powers
at
bay
from
now
till
gabriel
trump
an
we
had
food
enow
quoth
beltane
is
a
fair
thought
that
and
i
heard
there
be
many
outlaws
in
the
woods
hereabouts
yea
forsooth
and
each
and
every
a
a
rogue
in
faith
o
very
lewd
knaves
see
ye
now
that
would
have
slain
me
three
days
agone
but
for
my
comrade
walkyn
scurvy
dogs
fit
for
the
halter
they
be
in
faith
ha
quoth
beltane
thoughtful
of
brow
they
be
wild
men
meseemeth
desperate
knaves
one
and
all
and
look
ye
they
would
have
slain

nodded
beltane
all
the
of
town
and
village
and
look
ye
they
would
aye
said
beltane
thieves
rogues
and
murderers
branded
felons
runaway
serfs
and
villeins
is
well
said
beltane
so
shall
they
be
my
comrades
henceforth
thy
comrades
stammered
the
archer
staring
in
amaze
thy
comrades
these
base
knaves
that
would
have
hanged
me
me
that
am
like
my
father
before
me
so
peradventure
giles
will
we
make
them
free
men
also
howbeit
this
day
i
seek
them
out
seek
them
is
death
death
let
it
be
is
none
so
fearful
they
will
slay
thee
out
of
hand
a
wild
rabblement
lawless
and
disordered
so
would
i
bring
order
among
them
giles
and
thou
shalt
aid
me
i
aid
thee
how
have
me
company
with
such
vile
carrion
not
i
forsooth
i
am
a
soldier
and
no
serf
like
walkyn
or
villein
like
roger
but
sure
you
do
but
jest
brother
so
will
i
laugh
with
thee
but
now
very
suddenly
beltane
reached
out
his
long
arm
and
seizing
giles
in
mighty
hand
dragged
him
to
his
knees
and
giles
staring
up
in
amaze
looked
into
the
face
of
the
new
beltane
whose
blue
eyes
glared
frowning
brows
and
whose
lips
curled
back
from
gleaming
teeth
giles
said
he
softly
rocking
the
archer
in
his
grasp
o
giles
brabblecombe
o
the
hills
did
i
not
save
thy
roguish
life
for
thee
did
not
walkyn
and
roger
preserve
it
to
thee
so
doth
thy
life
belong
to
walkyn
and
to
roger
and
to
me
four
men
are
we
together
four
brothers
in
arms
vowed
to
each
other
in
the
fulfilment
of
a
purpose
is
it
not
so
yea
verily
lord
good
men
and
true
are
we
all
but
see
you
not
lord
these
outlaws
be
lewd
fellows
see
you
not
giles
these
outlaws
be
men
even
as
we
who
like
us
can
laugh
and
weep
can
bleed
and
die
who
can
use
their
lives
to
purpose
good
or
evil
even
as
we
therefore
since
they
are
men
i
will
make
of
them
our
comrades
also
an
it
may
be
thus
saying
beltane
loosed
giles
and
turning
to
the
table
fell
to
eating
again
while
the
archer
sat
upon
the
floor
nursing
his
bruised
arm
and
staring
quoth
beltane
at
last
we
will
seek
out
and
talk
with
these
outlaws
giles
talk
with
a
pack
of
yea
forsooth
nodded
giles
rubbing
his
arm
i
am
minded
to
strike
such
a
blow
as
shall
hearten
sir
benedict
for
the
siege
and
shake
black
ivo
confidence
aha
cried
giles
springing
up
so
that
his
jingled
aha
a
sweet
thought
tall
brother
could
we
fire
another
gibbet
now
know
you
where
the
outlaws
lie
hid
giles
nay
lord
none
save
themselves
and
walkyn
know
that
walkyn
methinks
was
great
among
them
once
and
where
is
walkyn
so
soon
as
ye
slept
lord
he
and
roger
went
forth
according
to
thy
word
as
for
me
i
stayed
here
to
watch
from
the
yonder
you
may
command
the
road
in
the
valley
and
unseen
see
you
may
see
but
come
an
thy
hunger
be
allayed
reach
me
thy
hand
that
i
may
file
off
those
iron
bracelets
nay
let
be
giles
i
will
wear
them
henceforth
until
my
vow
be
accomplished
hereupon
beltane
arose
and
climbing
the
ladder
looked
forth
through
a
screen
of
leaves
and
underbrush
and
saw
that
from
the
fissure
the
ground
sloped
steeply
down
a
hill
thick
with
gorse
and
bramble
at
whose
base
the
road
led
away
north
and
south
until
it
was
lost
in
the
green
of
the
forest
now
as
beltane
stood
thus
gazing
down
at
the
winding
road
whose
white
dust
was
already
mellowing
to
evening
he
beheld
one
who
ran
wondrous
fleetly
despite
the
ragged
cloak
that
flapped
about
his
long
legs
and
whose
feet
spurned
the
dust
beneath
them
so
fast
was
a
marvel
to
behold
moreover
as
he
ran
he
bounded
hither
and
thither
and
with
every
bound
an
arrow
sped
by
him
from
where
some
distance
behind
ran
divers
foresters
bedight
in
a
green
livery
beltane
thought
he
recognized
but
even
as
beltane
grasped
the
branches
that
screened
him
minded
to
swing
himself
up
to
the
fellow
aid
the
fugitive
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
came
leaping
up
the
slope
but
of
a
sudden
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
throwing
up
his
hands
fell
face
down
upon
the
ling
and
so
lay
what
time
came
up
one
of
the
pursuers
that
had
outstripped
his
fellows
but
as
he
paused
his
sword
shortened
for
the
thrust
up
sprang
the
fugitive
a
great
axe
flashed
and
whirled
and
fell
nor
need
was
there
for
further
stroke
then
while
the
rest
of
the
pursuers
were
yet
a
great
way
off
walkyn
came
leaping
up
the
hill
back
from
the
ladder
beltane
leapt
and
down
through
the
fissure
came
walkyn
to
fall
upon
his
feet
to
shake
free
the
ladder
after
him
and
thereafter
to
sit
panting
upon
a
stool
his
bloody
axe
betwixt
his
knees
pertolepe
wolves
he
panted
two
of
them
have
i
slain
within
the
last
mile
and
grinning
he
patted
the
haft
of
his
axe
what
news
walkyn
death
panted
walkyn
there
be
five
dead
men
from
the
bartizan
tower
above
garthlaxton
keep
and
one
that
dieth
under
the
torture
now
for
i
heard
grievous
outcry
and
all
by
reason
of
thy
escape
lord
come
you
then
from
garthlaxton
quoth
beltane
frowning
aye
lord
for
see
you
was
market
day
so
went
i
to
one
i
know
that
is
a
swineherd
a
trusty
fellow
that
bringeth
hogs
each
week
unto
garthlaxton
so
did
we
change
habits
and
went
to
garthlaxton
together
driving
the
hogs
before
us
thereafter
while
he
was
away
chaffering
i
sat
me
down
in
the
outer
bailey
tending
my
beasts
yet
with
eyes
and
ears
wide
and
with
my
hand
upon
mine
axe
my
cloak
lest
haply
i
might
chance
within
striking
distance
of
red
pertolepe
and
sitting
thus
i
heard
tell
that
he
had
marched
out
with
all
his
array
to
join
black
ivo
banner
whereupon
was
i
mightily
cast
down
but
it
chanced
the
wind
lifted
my
cloak
and
one
of
the
warders
spying
mine
axe
must
think
to
recognise
me
and
gave
the
hue
and
cry
whereat
i
incontinent
fled
ere
they
could
drop
the
portcullis
and
divers
rogues
after
me
aha
then
did
i
lead
them
a
right
merry
dance
by
moor
and
moss
by
briar
and
bog
and
contrived
to
slay
of
them
five

a
malison
on
him
he
is
not
yet
to
die
meseemeth
but
some
day
aye

day
so
saying
he
kissed
the
great
axe
and
setting
it
by
came
to
the
table
and
fell
to
eating
mightily
while
giles
sat
hard
by
busied
with
certain
arrows
yet
betwixt
whiles
watching
beltane
who
crossing
to
the
bed
of
fern
laid
him
down
thereon
and
closed
his
eyes
but
of
a
sudden
he
raised
his
head
hearkening
to
a
whistle
soft
and
melodious
near
at
hand
aha
exclaimed
giles
setting
aside
his
arrows
yonder
should
be
roger
a
hungry

and
a
surly
roger
is
rare
sport
to
lighten
a
dull
hour
heaven
send
our
roger
be
surly
so
saying
the
archer
went
forth
and
presently
came
hasting
back
with
roger
at
his
heels
scowling
and
in
woeful
plight
torn
and
stained
and
besprent
with
mud
his
rawhide
sodden
and
oozing
water
he
stood
glowering
at
giles
beneath
the
bloody
clout
that
swathed
his
head
his
brawny
fist
upon
his
dagger
no
food
left
say
ye
giles

i
you

flashed
his
dagger

the
archer

roger
seating
himself
at
table

woods

thick
with
pertolepe
rogues
seeking

ralpho
that

in
the
dungeons
once
thrice
did
they
beset
me
close
and
once
did
i
escape
by
running
once
by
standing
up
to
my
neck
in
a
pool
and
once
lay
i
hid
in
a
tree
whiles
they
below
ate
and
drank
like
ravening
swine
and
i
a
murrain

laughed
grim
walkyn
and
pointed
to
his
axe
forsooth
and
is
it
so
growled
roger
his
scowl
relaxing
now
will
i
eat
full
and
blithely
for
ralpho
was
an
arrant
knave
now
when
his
hunger
was
somewhat
assuaged
roger
turned
and
looked
where
beltane
lay
my
master
sleepeth
said
he
his
voice
grown
gentle
nay
roger
i
lie
and

closed
why

and
lances
lords
and
barons
knights
and

beltane

they
have
set
up
his
pavilion
beside
the
duke
tell
me
now
said
beltane
coming
to
his
elbow
how
many
men
should
be
left
within
garthlaxton
for
garrison
think
you
an
hundred
belike
said
walkyn
less
quoth
roger
garthlaxton
is
so
strong
a
score
of
men
have
held
it
ere
now
is
accounted
the
strongest
castle
in
all
the
duchy
save
only
thrasfordham
truly
is
very
strong
said
beltane
thoughtfully
and
lying
down
again
he
closed
his
eyes
and
spake
slow
and
drowsily
aye
is
so
strong
its
garrison
being
secure
should
sleep
sound
o
nights
so
be
no
great
matter
to
surprise
and
burn
it
ere
the
dawn
methinks
burn
garthlaxton
cried
the
archer
and
sprang
up
scattering
the
arrows
right
and
left
master
stammered
roger
master
as
for
walkyn
he
having
his
mouth
full
and
striving
to
speak
choked
instead
lord
lord
he
gasped
at
last
to
see
garthlaxton
go
up
in
flame
o
blessed
sight
its
walls
crumble
to
ruin
ah
sweet
rare
sight
but
alas
is
a
mighty
place
and
strong
and
we
but
four
there
be
outlaws
in
the
quoth
beltane
ha
the
outlaws
cried
giles
and
clapped
hand
to
thigh
aye
nodded
beltane
bring
me
to
the
outlaws
but
bethink
thee
tall
brother
of
what
avail
a
thousand
such
poor
ragged
rogues
the
walls
of
garthlaxton
they
shall
not
tear
you
the
stones
with
their
nor
rend
them
with
their
teeth
thou
to
burn
garthlaxton
growled
walkyn
biting
at
his
fingers
ha
to
give
it
to
the
fire
but
the
walls
be
mighty
and
strong
and
the
outlaws
scattered
take
a
week
to
muster
enough
to
attempt
a
storm
nor
have
they
engines
for
battery
enough
said
beltane
rising
his
brows
close
drawn
now
hearken
and
mark
me
well
the
hole
whereby
one
man
came
out
may
let
a
thousand
in
give
me
but
an
hundred
men
at
my
back
and
garthlaxton
shall
be
aflame
ere
dawn
so
come
now
walkyn
bring
me
to
the
outlaws
but
lord
these
be
very
wild
men
obedient
to
no
law
save
their
own
and
will
follow
none
but
their
own
lawless
men
forsooth
governed
only
by
the
sword
and
made
desperate
by
wrong
and
fear
of
the
rope
then
is
time
one
learned
them
other
ways
walkyn
so
now
i
command
thee
bring
me
to
them
is
said
thou
wert
great
among
them
once
hereupon
walkyn
rose
and
taking
up
his
mighty
axe
twirled
it
lightly
in
his
hand
behold
lord
said
he
by
virtue
of
this
good
axe
am
i
free
of
the
for
long
since
when
certain
lords
of
black
ivo
burned
our
manor
and
our
mother
and
sister
and
father
therein
my
twin
brother
and
i
had
fashioned
two
axes
such
as
few
men
might
wield
this
and
another
and
thus
armed
took
to
the
green
where
other
wronged
men
joined
us
till
we
counted
many
a
score
tall
fellows
lusty
fighters
all
and
many
of
ivo
rogues
we
slew
until
of
those
knights
and
that
burned
our
home
there
none
remained
save
red
pertolepe
and
gui
of
allerdale
but
in
the
green
love
came
even
to
me
so
i
laid
by
mine
axe
and
vengeance
likewise
and
came
to
know
happiness
until
upon
a
day
they
hanged
my
brother
and
thereafter
they
slew
her
my
wife
and
child
as
ye
saw
then
would
i
have
joined
the
outlaws
again
but
in
my
place
they
had
set
up
one
tostig
a
sturdy
rogue
and
foul
who
ruleth
by
might
of
arm
and
liveth
but
for
plunder
and
worse
him
i
would
have
fought
but
upon
that
night
i
fell
in
with
thee
thus
see
you
though
i
am
free
of
the
wild
power
with
these
outlaws
have
i
none
so
an
i
should
bring
thee
into
their
secret
tostig
would
assuredly
give
thee
to
swift
death
nor
could
i
save
thee
yet
must
i
go
said
beltane
since
while
i
live
vowed
am
i
to
free
pentavalon
and
what
think
you
is
pentavalon
is
not
her
hills
and
valleys
her
towns
and
cities
but
the
folk
that
dwell
therein
they
each
one
man
and
woman
and
child
the
rich
and
poor
the
high
and
low
the
evil
and
the
good
aye
all
those
that
live
in
outlawry
these
are
pentavalon
so
now
will
i
go
unto
these
wild
men
and
once
they
follow
my
call
will
i
rest
until
they
be
free
men
every
one
each
blow
they
strike
the
wounds
they
suffer
shall
win
them
back
to
honourable
life
to
hearth
and
home
and
thus
shall
they
be
free
indeed
so
walkyn
bring
me
to
the
outlaws
then
stood
walkyn
and
looked
upon
beltane
heavy
brows
nothing
speaking
and
turned
him
of
a
sudden
and
striding
forth
of
the
cave
came
back
bearing
another
great
axe
lord
said
he
thy
long
sword
is
missing
methinks
take
now
this
axe
in
place
of
it
was
my
brother
once
see
i
have
kept
it
bright
for
i
loved
him
he
was
a
man
yet
man
art
thou
also
worthy
methinks
and
able
to
wield
it
take
it
therefore
lord
duke
that
art
my
mayhap
it
shall
aid
thee
to
bring
order
in
the
and
win
pentavalon
to
freedom
howbeit
thou
dost
go
though
it
be
to
shame
and
failure
i
am
with
thee
and
i
cried
giles
reaching
for
his
bow
and
i
also
quoth
roger
chapter
xxix
how
beltane
slew
tostig
and
spake
with
the
wild
men
the
sun
was
down
what
time
they
left
the
hill
country
and
came
out
upon
a
wide
heath
void
of
trees
and
desolate
where
was
a
wind
cold
and
clammy
to
chill
the
flesh
where
rush
and
reed
stirred
fitfully
filling
the
dark
with
stealthy
rustlings
master
quoth
roger
shivering
and
glancing
about
him
here
is
hangstone
waste
and
yonder
the
swamps
of
hundleby
fen
you
can
smell
them
from
here
and
is
an
evil
place
this
for
is
said
the
souls
of
murdered
folk
do
meet
here
betimes
and
hold
high
revel
when
the
moon
be
full
here
on
wild
nights
witches
and
warlocks
ride
shrieking
upon
the
wind
with
goblins
damned
ha
say
ye
so
good
roger
quoth
the
archer
now
the
sweet
saint
giles
go
with
us
amen
and
he
crossed
himself
devoutly
so
went
they
in
silence
awhile
until
they
were
come
where
the
sedge
grew
thick
and
high
above
whispering
ooze
and
where
trees
stunted
and
misshapen
lifted
knotted
arms
in
the
gloom
lord
spake
walkyn
his
voice
low
and
here
is
the
marsh
a
place
of
death
for
them
that
know
it
not
where
an
a
man
tread
awry
is
a
quaking
slime
to
suck
him
under
full
many
a
man
lieth
the
reeds
yonder
for
there
is
but
one
path
very
narrow
and
winding
follow
close
then
and
step
where
i
shall
step
aye
master
whispered
roger
and
look
ye
touch
no
tree
as
ye
go
said
they
do
grow
from
the
bones
of
perished
men
so
touch
them
not
lest
some
foul
goblin
blast
thee
so
went
they
following
a
narrow
track
that
wound
betwixt
sedge
past
trees
huddled
and
distorted
that
seemed
to
writhe
and
shiver
in
the
clammy
air
until
beyond
the
swamp
they
came
to
a
place
of
rocks
where
ragged
crags
loomed
high
and
vague
before
them
now
all
at
once
walkyn
raised
a
warning
hand
as
from
the
shadow
of
those
rocks
a
hoarse
voice
challenged
stand
cried
the
voice
who
goes
what
and
is
it
thou
rogue
perkyn
cried
walkyn
art
blind
not
to
know
me
aye
growled
the
voice
but
blind
or
no
i
see
others
with
thee
good
friends
all
quoth
walkyn
stand
forth
that
i
may
see
these
friends
o
thine
drawing
near
beltane
beheld
a
man
in
filthy
rags
who
held
a
long
bow
in
his
hand
with
an
arrow
on
the
string
at
sight
of
whom
roger
muttered
and
giles
held
his
nose
and
spat
aha
growled
the
man
perkyn
peering
under
his
matted
hair
i
like
not
the
looks
o
these
friends
o
thine
nor
we
thine
foul
fellow
quoth
giles
and
spat
again
how
cried
walkyn
fiercely
d
dare
bid
walkyn
stand
thou
meat
must
i
flesh
mine
axe
on
thy
vile
carcase
not
till
i
feather
a
shaft
in
thee
growled
perkyn
what
would
ye
speak
with
eric
o
the
noose
aha
and
what
would
ye
with
eric
forsooth
tostig
our
chief
and
tostig
man
am
i
as
for
eric
aye
aye
and
what
of
eric
spake
a
third
voice
a
soft
voice
and
liquid
and
a
man
stepped
forth
of
the
rocks
with
two
other
men
at
his
heels
now
well
met
eric
o
the
noose
quoth
walkyn
i
bring
promise
of
more
booty
and
mark
this
eric
i
bring
also
him
that
you
wot
of
now
hereupon
the
man
eric
drew
near
a
man
clad
in
skins
and
rusty
mail
who
looked
upon
beltane
with
head
strangely
askew
and
touched
a
furtive
hand
to
his
battered
ye
come
at
an
evil
hour
said
he
speaking
tostig
holdeth
high
feast
and
revel
for
we
took
a
rich
booty
at
the
ford
beyond
bassingthorp
merchants
out
of
winisfarne
with
well
laden
and
there
were
women
also
in
especial
one
very
fair
her
tostig
bore
hither
but
a
while
since
when
he
bade
them
bring
her
to
him
behold
she
had
stabbed
herself
with
her
bodkin
so
is
she
dead
and
tostig
raging
thus
i
say
ye
come
in
an
evil
hour
not
so
answered
beltane
methinks
we
come
in
good
hour
i
am
fain
to
speak
with
tostig
come
and
he
stepped
forward
but
eric
caught
him
by
the
arm
messire
said
he
yonder
be
over
five
score
lusty
fellows
fierce
and
doughty
fighters
all
that
live
but
to
do
the
will
of
tostig
and
do
proclaim
him
chief
since
he
hath
proved
himself
full
oft
mightiest
of
all
ah
nodded
beltane
a
strong
man
beyond
equal
a
fierce
man
that
knoweth
not
mercy
swift
to
anger
and
joyful
to
slay
at
all
times
why
look
you
sighed
beltane
neither
am
i
a
lamb
come
fain
am
i
to
speak
with
this
tostig
a
while
stood
eric
head
aslant
peering
at
beltane
then
at
a
muttered
word
from
walkyn
he
shook
his
head
and
beckoning
the
man
perkyn
aside
led
the
way
through
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
and
up
a
precipitous
path
beyond
and
as
he
went
beltane
saw
him
loosen
sword
in
scabbard
ever
as
they
clomb
the
path
grew
more
difficult
until
at
last
they
were
come
to
a
parapet
or
outwork
with
mantelets
of
osiers
beyond
cunningly
wrought
above
which
a
glimmered
and
from
beyond
which
a
voice
challenged
them
but
at
a
word
from
eric
the
sentinel
stood
aside
and
behold
a
narrow
opening
in
the
parapet
through
which
they
passed
and
so
up
another
path
defended
by
yet
another
parapet
of
osiers
now
of
a
sudden
having
climbed
the
ascent
beltane
paused
and
stood
leaning
upon
his
axe
for
from
where
he
now
stood
he
looked
down
into
a
great
hollow
green
and
whose
steep
sides
were
shaded
by
trees
and
bushes
in
the
midst
of
this
hollow
a
fire
burned
whose
blaze
showed
many
wild
figures
that
sprawled
round
about
in
garments
of
leather
and
garments
of
skins
its
ruddy
light
showed
faces
fierce
and
hairy
it
glinted
on
rusty
mail
and
flashed
back
from
many
a
dinted
and
broad
and
upon
the
air
was
the
sound
of
noisy
talk
and
boisterous
laughter
through
the
midst
of
this
great
green
hollow
a
stream
wound
that
broadened
out
in
one
place
into
a
still
and
sleepy
pool
upon
whose
placid
surface
stars
seemed
to
float
a
deep
pool
whereby
was
a
tall
tree
now
beneath
this
tree
far
removed
from
the
fire
sat
a
great
swarthy
fellow
chin
on
fist
scowling
down
at
that
which
lay
at
his
feet
and
of
a
sudden
he
spurned
this
still
and
silent
shape
with
savage
foot
oswin
he
cried
walcher
throw
me
this
useless
carrion
into
the
pool
hereupon
came
two
sturdy
rogues
who
lifting
the
dead
betwixt
them
bore
her
to
the
edge
of
the
silent
pool
once
they
swung
and
twice
and
lo
the
floating
stars
shivered
to
a
sullen
splash
and
subsiding
rippled
softly
to
the
reedy
banks
slowly
the
swarthy
giant
rose
and
stood
upon
his
legs
and
beltane
knew
him
for
the
tallest
man
he
had
ever
seen
oswin
quoth
he
and
beckoned
with
his
finger
oswin
did
i
not
bid
thee
keep
watch
upon
yon
dainty
light
o
love
now
meeting
the
speaker
baleful
eye
the
man
oswin
sprang
back
striving
to
draw
sword
but
even
so
an
iron
hand
was
about
his
throat
he
was
lifted
by
a
mighty
arm
that
held
him
a
while
choking
and
kicking
above
the
silent
pool
until
he
had
gasped
and
kicked
his
life
out
shouts
and
gibes
and
hoarse
laughter
thereafter
again
the
sullen
waters
quivered
were
still
and
tostig
stood
frowning
down
at
those
floating
stars
then
beltane
leapt
down
into
the
hollow
and
strode
nor
stayed
until
he
stood
face
to
face
with
tostig
beside
the
sullen
pool
but
swift
as
he
had
come
roger
had
followed
and
now
stood
to
his
back
hand
on
sword
aha
quoth
tostig
in
staring
amaze
and
stood
a
while
eying
beltane
with
hungry
gaze
by
thor
said
he
but
is
a
good
armour
and
should
fit
me
well
off
with
it
off
i
am
tostig
so
saying
he
drew
a
slow
pace
nearer
his
teeth
agleam
his
great
hands
opening
and
shutting
whereat
out
leapt
roger
blade
but
now
the
outlaws
came
running
to
throng
about
them
shouting
and
jostling
one
another
and
brandishing
their
weapons
yet
striking
no
blow
waiting
gleefully
for
what
might
befall
and
ever
beltane
looked
upon
tostig
and
tostig
assured
and
confident
smiled
grimly
upon
beltane
until
the
ragged
throng
about
them
watching
grew
hushed
and
still
then
beltane
spake
put
up
thy
sword
roger
said
he
in
very
truth
this
tostig
is
a
foul
thing
and
should
not
die
by
thy
good
steel
so
put
up
thy
sword
roger
and
now
no
man
spake
or
moved
but
all
stood
rigid
and
scarce
breathing
waiting
for
the
end
for
tostig
smiling
no
more
stood
agape
as
one
that
doubts
his
senses
then
laughed
he
loud
and
long
and
turned
as
if
to
reach
his
sword
that
leaned
against
the
tree
and
in
that
instant
sprang
straight
for
beltane
throat
his
griping
hands
outstretched
but
swift
as
he
beltane
letting
fall
his
axe
slipped
aside
and
smote
with
mailed
fist
and
as
tostig
reeled
from
the
blow
closed
with
and
caught
him
in
a
deadly
wrestling
hold
for
all
men
might
see
beltane
had
locked
one
arm
tostig
bearded
chin
and
that
tostig
shaggy
head
was
bending
slowly
backwards
then
the
outlaws
surged
closer
a
dark
menacing
ring
where
steel
flickered
but
lo
to
roger
right
hand
sprang
walkyn
gripping
his
axe
and
upon
his
left
came
giles
his
poised
a
shaft
upon
the
string
so
stood
the
three
alert
and
watchful
eager
for
fight
what
time
the
struggle
waxed
ever
more
fierce
and
deadly
to
and
fro
the
wrestlers
swayed
locked
in
vicious
grapple
grimly
silent
save
for
the
dull
trampling
of
their
feet
upon
the
moss
and
the
gasp
and
hiss
of
panting
breaths
writhing
and
twisting
stumbling
and
slipping
or
suddenly
still
with
feet
that
gripped
the
sod
with
bulging
muscles
swelled
and
rigid
that
cracked
beneath
the
strain
while
eye
glared
death
to
eye
but
beltane
iron
fingers
were
fast
locked
and
little
by
little
slow
but
sure
tostig
swart
head
was
tilting
up
and
back
further
and
further
until
his
forked
beard
pointed
upwards
until
of
a
sudden
there
brake
from
his
writhen
lips
a
cry
loud
and
shrill
that
sank
to
groan
and
ended
in
a
sound
a
faint
sound
soft
and
sudden
but
now
behold
tostig
head
swayed
loosely
backwards
behind
his
shoulders
his
knees
sagged
his
great
arms
loosed
their
hold
then
or
he
could
fall
beltane
stooped
beneath
and
putting
forth
all
his
strength
raised
him
high
above
his
head
and
panting
groaning
with
the
strain
turned
and
hurled
dead
tostig
down
into
the
pool
whose
sullen
waters
leapt
to
a
mighty
splash
and
presently
subsiding
whispered
softly
in
the
reeds
and
for
a
while
no
man
stirred
or
spoke
only
beltane
stood
upon
the
marge
and
panted
then
turned
he
to
the
outlaws
and
catching
up
his
axe
therewith
pointed
downwards
to
that
stilly
pool
whose
placid
waters
seemed
to
hold
nought
but
a
glory
of
floating
stars
behold
he
panted
here
was
an
evil
man
a
menace
to
wherefore
is
he
dead
but
as
for
ye
come
tell
me
how
long
will
ye
be
slaves
hereupon
rose
a
hoarse
murmur
that
grew
and
grew
then
stood
the
man
perkyn
forward
and
scowling
pointed
at
beltane
with
his
spear
comrades
he
cried
he
hath
slain
tostig
he
hath
murdered
our
leader
come
now
let
us
slay
him
and
speaking
he
leapt
at
beltane
with
levelled
spear
but
quick
as
he
leapt
so
leapt
walkyn
his
long
arms
rose
and
fell
and
thereafter
setting
his
foot
upon
body
he
shook
his
bloody
axe
in
the
scowling
faces
of
the
outlaws
back
fools
he
cried
have
ye
no
eyes
see
ye
not
is
he
of
whom
i
spake
he
that
burned
belsaye
gallows
and
brake
ope
the
dungeon
of

that
is
friend
to
all
distressed
folk
and
broken
men
know
ye
not
beltane
the
duke
hear
him
ye
fools
hear
him
hereupon
the
outlaws
stared
upon
beltane
and
upon
each
other
and
fumbled
with
their
weapons
as
men
that
knew
not
their
own
minds
while
beltane
wiping
sweat
from
him
leaned
upon
his
axe
and
panted
with
the
three
at
his
elbow
alert
and
watchful
eager
for
fight
but
perkyn
lay
where
he
had
fallen
very
still
and
with
his
face
hidden
in
the
grass
of
a
sudden
beltane
laid
by
his
axe
and
reached
out
his
hands
brothers
said
he
how
long
will
ye
be
slaves

forsooth
cried
one

and

hiding

within
the
wilderness
living

in
awe
and
dread
lest

noose
free

so
akin
to

indeed
now
hereupon
divers
muttered
in
their
beards
and
others
looked
askance
on
one
another
then
spake
the
man
eric
of
the
wry
neck
messire
quoth
he
all
that
you
say
is
sooth
but
what
remedy
can
ye
bring

now
then
spake
beltane

this
wise
all

ye
that

forsooth
then
follow
me
now
at
this
the
outlaws
began
to
murmur
among
themselves
wagging
their
heads
one
to
another
and
voicing
their
grievances
thus
they
cut
off
mine
ears
for
resisting
my
lord
taxes
and
for
this
i
would
have
justice
they
burned
me
in
the
hand

my
lord

had
a
wife

and
she
was
young
and
fair

of
harsh
voices
but
whither

there
many
among
ye
that
know
sir

now
went
there
up
a
roar
and
ominous
brawny
fists
were
shaken
and

flashed
and
glittered
ah

and
ere

dawn
garthlaxton

garthlaxton
cried
eric
garthlaxton
and
thereafter
all
men
stared
on
beltane
as
one
that
is
mad
look
now
said
beltane
sir
pertolepe
hath
ridden
forth
with
all
his
company

know
a
secret
way
beneath
the
wall
well
enough
who
among
ye
will
follow
and
smite
for
freedom
and
pentavalon
that
will
i
cried
eric
falling
upon
his
knee
and
i
and
i
cried
others
and
so
came
they
to
crowd
eagerly
about
beltane
to
touch
his
hand
or
the
links
of
his
bright
mail
lead
us
they
cried
come
lead
us
nay
first
hearken
from
henceforth
outlaws
are
ye
none
come
now
one
and
all
draw
and
swear
me
on
your
swords
to
make
your
strength
a
shelter
to
the
weak
to
smite
henceforth
but
in
honourable
cause
for
freedom
for
justice
and
pentavalon
swear
me
upon
your
swords
to
abide
by
this
oath
and
to
him
that
breaks
it
death
swear
so
there
upon
their
knees
with
gleaming
swords
uplifted
these
wild
men
swore
the
oath
then
up
sprang
walkyn
pointing
to
beltane
with
his
axe
brothers
he
cried
behold
a
man
that
doeth
such
deeds
as
no
man
ever
did
that
burned
the
gallows
burst
ope
the
dungeon
of
belsaye
and
slew
tostig
the
mighty
with
naked
hands
behold
beltane
the
duke
is
he
not
worthy
to
be
our
leader
shall
we
not
follow
him
then
came
a
roar
of
voices
aye
let
us
follow
let
us
follow
on
then
cried
walkyn
his
glittering
axe
aloft
to
garthlaxton
then
from
an
hundred
brawny
throats
a
roar
went
up
to
heaven
a
cry
that
hissed
through
clenched
teeth
and
rang
from
eager
lips
wilder
fiercer
than
before
and
the
cry
was
garthlaxton
chapter
xxx
how
they
smote
garthlaxton
it
was
in
the
cold
still
hour
night
and
dawn
that
beltane
halted
his
wild
company
upon
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
ran
a
gurgling
softly
in
the
dark
here
did
he
set
divers
eager
fellows
to
fell
a
tree
and
thereafter
to
lop
away
branch
and
twig
and
so
bidding
them
wait
stole
forward
alone
soon
before
him
rose
garthlaxton
frowning
blacker
than
the
night
a
gloom
of
tower
and
turret
of
massy
wall
and
battlement
its
mighty
keep
rising
stark
and
grim
against
a
faint
light
of
stars
now
as
he
stood
to
scan
with
purposeful
eye
donjon
and
bartizan
merlon
and
for
gleam
of
light
for
glint
of
mail
or
he
grew
aware
of
a
sound
hard
by
yet
very
faint
and
sweet
that
came
and
went
a
small
and
silvery
chime
he
could
by
no
means
account
for
so
crept
he
near
and
nearer
and
with
ears
on
the
stretch
till
he
was
stayed
by
the
broad
sluggish
waters
of
the
moat
and
thus
he
presently
espied
something
that
moved
in
the
gloom
high
above
the
great
gateway
something
that
stirred
pendulous
in
the
air
of
coming
dawn
now
as
he
peered
upward
through
the
gloom
came
the
wind
colder
stronger
than
before
a
chill
and
ghostly
wind
that
flapped
the
heavy
folds
of
his
mantle
that
sighed
forlornly
in
the
woods
afar
and
softly
smote
the
misty
jingling
thing
above
swayed
it
swung
it
out
from
the
denser
shadows
of
scowling
battlement
so
that
beltane
could
see
at
last
and
seeing
started
back
faint
and
sick
his
flesh
his
breath
in
check
pale
and
rigid
lips
and
beholding
what
manner
of
thing
this
was
he
fell
upon
his
knees
with
head
bowed
low
yet
spake
no
prayer
only
his
hands
gripped
fiercely
upon
his
axe
while
to
and
fro
in
the
dark
above
that
awful
shape
turned
and
swung
its
flaunting
dreadfully
awry
its
motley
stained
and
rent
a
wretched
thing
twisted
and
torn
a
thing
of
blasting
horror
and
ever
as
it
swung
upon
the
air
it
rang
a
chime
upon
its
little
silver
bells
a
merry
chime
and
mocking
that
seemed
to
gibe
at
coming
day
now
in
a
while
looking
upon
that
awful
shape
beltane
spake
o
beda
he
whispered
o
manly
heart
hid
a
fool
disguise
o
fool
that
now
art
wiser
than
the
wisest
thy
pains
and
sorrows
have
lifted
thee
to
heaven
methinks
and
freed
now
of
thy
foolish
clay
thou
dost
walk
with
angels
and
look
within
the
face
of
god
but
by
thine
agonies
endured
now
do
i
swear
this
night
to
raise
to
thy
poor
body
a
pyre
fit
for
the
flesh
of
kings
then
beltane
arose
and
lifting
high
his
axe
shook
it
against
garthlaxton
frowning
might
where
was
neither
glint
of
armour
nor
gleam
of
and
turning
hasted
back
to
that
dark
and
silent
company
which
at
his
word
rose
up
from
brake
and
fern
and
thicket
and
followed
whither
he
led
a
long
line
soundless
and
within
a
phantom
world
where
a
grey
mist
swirled
and
drifted
in
the
air
of
dawn
swift
and
silent
they
followed
him
these
wild
men
with
fierce
eyes
and
scowling
faces
all
set
toward
that
mighty
keep
that
loomed
high
against
the
glimmering
stars
axe
and
bow
sword
and
pike
and
gisarm
in
rusty
mail
in
rags
of
leather
and
skins
they
crept
from
bush
to
bush
from
tree
to
tree
till
they
were
come
to
that
little
pool
wherein
beltane
had
bathed
him
aforetime
in
the
dawn
here
they
halted
what
time
beltane
sought
to
and
fro
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
until
at
last
within
a
screen
of
leaves
and
vines
he
found
the
narrow
opening
he
sought
then
turned
he
and
beckoned
those
ghostly
silent
shapes
about
him
and
speaking
quick
and
low
counselled
them
thus
look
now
this
secret
burrow
leadeth
under
the
foundations
of
the
keep
thus
so
soon
as
we
be
in
let
walkyn
and
giles
with
fifty
men
haste
to
smite
all
within
the
then
up
with
portcullis
and
down
with
drawbridge
and
over
into
the
barbican
there
to
lie
in
ambush
what
time
roger
and
i
with
eric
here
and
the
fifty
and
five
shall
fire
the
keep
and
hid
within
the
dark
raise
a
mighty
outcry
that
those
within
the
keep
and
they
that
garrison
the
castle
roused
by
the
fire
and
our
shout
shall
issue
out
amazed
so
will
we
fall
upon
them
and
they
taken
by
surprise
shall
seek
to
escape
us
by
the
gate
then
walkyn
sally
ye
out
of
the
barbican
and
smite
them
at
the
drawbridge
so
shall
we
have
them
front
and
rear
how
think
you
is
it
agreed
agreed
agreed
came
the
gruff
and
whispered
chorus
then
last
and
mark
this
well
each
one
till
that
i
give
the
word
let
no
man
speak
let
death
be
swift
but
let
it
be
silent
then
having
drawn
his
about
his
face
and
laced
it
close
beltane
caught
up
his
axe
and
stepped
into
the
tunnel
there
he
kindled
a
torch
of
pine
and
stooping
the
low
roof
went
on
before
one
by
one
the
others
followed
roger
and
giles
walkyn
and
eric
bearing
the
heavy
log
upon
their
shoulders
and
behind
them
axe
and
bow
sword
and
pike
and
gisarm
a
wild
company
in
garments
of
leather
and
garments
of
skins
and
silent
as
ghosts
yet
purposeful
ghosts
withal
soon
came
they
to
the
iron
door
and
beltane
stood
aside
whereon
the
mighty
four
bending
brawny
shoulders
swung
the
log
crashing
against
the
iron
thrice
and
four
times
smote
they
might
and
main
ere
rusted
bolt
and
rivet
gave
beneath
the
battery
and
the
door
swung
wide
down
went
the
log
and
ready
steel
flashed
as
beltane
strode
on
his
torch
aflare
oozing
walls
up
steps
of
stone
that
yet
were
slimy
to
the
tread
on
and
up
by
winding
passage
and
stairway
until
they
came
where
was
a
parting
of
the
ways
the
first
still
ascending
the
second
leading
off
at
a
sharp
angle
here
beltane
paused
in
doubt
and
bidding
the
others
halt
followed
the
second
passage
until
he
was
come
to
a
narrow
flight
of
steps
that
rose
to
the
stone
roof
above
but
here
in
the
wall
beside
the
steps
he
beheld
a
rusty
iron
lever
and
reaching
up
he
bore
upon
the
lever
and
lo
the
flagstone
above
the
steps
reared
itself
on
end
and
showed
a
square
of
gloom
beyond
then
went
beltane
and
signalled
to
the
others
so
one
by
one
they
followed
him
up
through
the
opening
into
that
same
gloomy
chamber
where
he
had
lain
in
bonds
and
hearkened
to
wails
of
torment
but
now
the
place
was
bare
and
empty
and
the
door
stood
ajar
so
came
beltane
thither
bearing
the
torch
and
stepped
softly
into
the
room
beyond
a
wide
room
and
richly
furnished
and
looking
around
upon
the
voluptuous
luxury
of
gilded
couch
and
wide
soft
bed
beltane
frowned
suddenly
upon
a
woman
dainty
broidered
shoe
roger
he
whispered
what
place
is
this
is
red
pertolepe
master
ah
sighed
beltane
is
rank
of
him
methinks
lead
on
roger
go
you
and
walkyn
before
them
in
the
dark
and
wait
for
me
in
the
bailey
one
by
one
the
wild
company
went
by
beltane
and
stealthy
until
there
none
remained
save
giles
who
leaning
upon
his
bow
looked
with
yearning
eyes
upon
the
costly
splendour
aha
he
whispered
a
pretty
nest
tall
brother
i
warrant
ye
full
many
a
fair
white
dove
hath
beat
her
tender
pinions
come
said
beltane
and
speaking
reached
out
his
torch
to
and
tapestried
wall
and
immediately
silk
and
arras
went
up
in
a
puff
of
flame
a
leaping
fire
that
licked
at
gilded
and
carven
screen
and
panel
brother
whispered
giles
o
brother
is
a
sin
methinks
to
lose
so
much
good
booty
that
coffer
now
ha
with
the
cry
the
archer
leapt
out
through
the
tapestried
doorway
came
the
ring
of
steel
a
heavy
fall
and
thereafter
a
shriek
that
rang
and
echoed
far
and
near
ere
it
sank
to
a
silence
wherein
a
voice
whispered
quick
brother
the
besotted
fools
stir
at
last
away
then
that
which
sprawled
behind
the
curtain
beltane
sped
along
a
passage
and
down
a
winding
stair
yet
pausing
ever
and
anon
with
flaring
torch
and
ever
small
fires
waxed
behind
him
so
came
he
at
last
to
the
and
hurling
the
blazing
torch
behind
him
closed
the
heavy
door
and
now
standing
upon
the
platform
he
looked
down
into
the
inner
bailey
dawn
was
at
hand
a
glimmering
mist
wherein
vague
forms
moved
what
time
walkyn
looming
ghostly
and
gigantic
in
the
mist
mustered
his
silent
ghostly
company
ere
lifting
his
axe
he
turned
and
vanished
his
fifty
phantoms
at
his
heels
now
glancing
upward
at
the
rugged
face
of
the
keep
beltane
beheld
thin
wisps
of
smoke
that
curled
from
every
spirals
growing
ever
denser
ere
they
vanished
in
the
clammy
mists
of
dawn
while
from
within
a
muffled
clamour
rose
low
and
inarticulate
yet
full
of
terror
then
beltane
strode
down
the
stair
and
came
forthright
upon
roger
pale
and
anxious
who
yet
greeted
him
in
joyous
whisper
master
i
began
to
fear
for
thee
what
now
to
the
arch
of
the
parapet
yonder
let
each
man
crouch
there
in
the
gloom
nor
stir
until
i
give
word
now
as
they
crouched
thus
with
weapons
and
eyes
that
glared
upon
the
coming
day
a
sudden
trumpet
brayed
alarm
upon
the
battlements
shouts
were
heard
far
and
near
and
a
running
of
mailed
feet
steel
clashed
the
great
castle
waking
at
last
was
all
astir
about
them
and
full
of
sudden
bustle
and
tumult
and
ever
the
clamour
of
voices
waxed
upon
the
misty
air
from
hurrying
groups
that
flitted
by
arming
as
they
ran
and
ever
the
fifty
and
five
crouching
in
the
dark
impatient
for
the
sign
watched
beltane
his
lip
his
frowning
brow
and
ever
from
belching
the
curling
waxed
blacker
and
more
dense
of
a
sudden
out
from
the
narrow
burst
a
huddle
of
choking
men
whose
gasping
cries
pierced
high
above
the
clamour
fire
fire
sir
fulk
is
slain
sir
fulk
lieth
fire
from
near
and
far
men
came
running
men
affrighted
and
dazed
with
sleep
a
pushing
jostling
unordered
throng
and
the
air
hummed
with
the
babel
of
their
voices
and
now
at
last
up
sprang
beltane
his
mittened
hand
aloft
arise
he
cried
arise
and
smite
for
pentavalon
and
from
the
gloom
behind
him
a
hoarse
roar
went
up
arise
arise
pentavalon
then
while
yet
the
thundered
in
the
air
they
swept
down
on
that
disordered
press
and
the
bailey
rang
and
echoed
with
the
fell
sounds
of
a
reeling
battle
a
hateful
din
of
hoarse
shouting
of
shrieks
and
cries
and
clashing
steel
axe
and
spear
sword
and
pike
and
gisarm
smote
and
thrust
and
swayed
stumbling
feet
spurned
and
trampled
yielding
forms
that
writhed
groaning
beneath
the
press
faces
glared
at
faces
haggard
with
the
dawn
while
to
and
fro
through
swirling
mist
and
acrid
smoke
the
battle
rocked
and
swayed
but
now
the
press
thinned
out
broke
and
yielded
before
beltane
whirling
axe
and
turning
he
found
roger
beside
him
all
and
direfully
besplashed
his
mailed
breast
heaving
as
he
leaned
gasping
upon
a
broadsword
red
from
point
to
hilt
ha
master
he
panted
is
done
already
see
they
break
and
fly
on
cried
beltane
on
pursue
pursue
after
them
to
the
gate
with
axe
and
spear
with
sword
and
pike
and
gisarm
they
smote
the
fugitives
across
the
wide
space
of
the
outer
bailey
under
the
narrow
arch
of
the
and
out
upon
the
drawbridge
beyond
but
here
of
a
sudden
the
fugitives
checked
their
flight
as
out
from
the
barbican
walkyn
leapt
brandishing
his
axe
and
with
the
fifty
at
his
back
so
there
upon
the
bridge
the
fight
raged
fiercer
than
before
men
smote
and
died
until
of
sir
pertolepe
garrison
there
none
remained
save
they
that
littered
that
narrow
causeway
now
by
the
good
saint
giles
my
patron
saint
gasped
giles
wiping
the
sweat
from
him
here
was
a
good
and
sweet
affray
tall
brother
a
very
proper
fight
et
while
it
lasted
aye
growled
walkyn
spurning
a
smitten
wretch
down
into
the
moat
was
ended
too
soon
be
these
all
in
faith
lord
but
now
upon
the
air
rose
shrill
cries
and
piercing
screams
that
seemed
to
split
the
dawn
o
women
cried
giles
and
forthwith
cleansed
and
sheathed
his
sword
and
fell
to
twirling
his
beard
aha
the
women
cried
a
ragged
fellow
turning
about
is
their
turn
let
us
to
the
women
but
a
strong
hand
caught
and
set
him
aside
and
beltane
strode
on
before
them
all
treading
swift
and
light
until
he
was
come
to
the
chapel
that
stood
beside
the
banqueting
hall
and
here
he
beheld
many
women
young
and
fair
for
the
most
part
huddled
about
the
high
altar
or
struggling
in
the
ragged
arms
that
grasped
them
now
did
they
these
poor
souls
looking
up
behold
one
in
knightly
mail
stained
and
foul
with
battle
yet
very
young
and
comely
of
face
who
leaned
him
upon
a
mighty
axe
and
scowled
frowning
brows
yet
his
frown
was
not
for
them
nor
did
his
blue
eyes
pause
at
any
one
of
them
whereat
hope
grew
within
them
and
with
white
hands
outstretched
they
implored
his
pity
men
of
pentavalon
said
he
as
men
this
night
have
ye
fought
in
goodly
cause
will
ye
now
forget
your
manhood
and
honour
ye
that
did
swear
to
me
upon
your
swords
come
loose
me
these
women
not
so
cried
one
a
great
rogue
we
have
fought
to
pleasure
thee
now
is
our
turn
loose
me
these
women
cried
beltane
his
blue
eyes
fierce
nay
these
be
our
booty
and
no
man
shall
gainsay
us
how
think
ye
comrades
now
beltane
smiled
upon
this
knave
and
smiling
drew
a
slow
pace
nearer
the
great
axe
in
his
mailed
hand
fellow
quoth
he
get
thee
out
now
lest
i
slay
thee
awhile
the
fellow
glared
upon
beltane
beheld
his
smiling
look
and
deadly
eye
and
slowly
loosing
his
trembling
captive
turned
and
strode
out
muttering
as
he
went
then
spake
beltane
to
the
shrinking
women
yet
even
so
his
blue
eyes
looked
upon
none
of
them
quoth
he
ye
are
free
to
go
whither
ye
will
take
what
ye
will
none
shall
gainsay
you
but
get
you
gone
within
this
hour
for
in
the
hour
garthlaxton
shall
be
no
more
then
beckoning
walkyn
he
bade
him
choose
six
men
and
turning
to
the
women
these
honourable
men
shall
bring
you
safe
upon
your
way
haste
you
to
be
gone
and
should
any
ask
how
garthlaxton
fell
say
was
by
the
hand
of
god
as
a
sure
and
certain
sign
that
pentavalon
shall
yet
arise
to
smite
evil
from
her
borders
say
also
that
he
that
spake
you
this
was
one
beltane
son
of
beltane
the
strong
heretofore
duke
of
pentavalon
thus
said
beltane
unto
these
women
his
brows
knit
and
with
eyes
that
looked
aside
from
each
and
every
and
so
went
forth
of
the
chapel
chapter
xxxi
how
giles
made
a
merry
song
morning
young
and
fragrant
bedecked
and
brave
with
gems
of
dewy
fire
a
blithe
morning
wherein
trees
stirred
whispering
and
birds
piped
joyous
welcome
to
the
sun
whose
level
beams
filled
the
world
with
glory
save
where
far
to
the
south
a
pillar
of
smoke
rose
upon
the
stilly
air
huge
awful
and
black
as
sin
a
writhing
column
shot
with
flame
that
went
up
high
as
heaven
o
merry
aye
merry
right
merry
i
be
to
live
and
to
love
the
merry
green
tree
nor
the
rain
nor
the
sleet
nor
the
cold
nor
the
heat
i
mind
if
my
love
will
come
thither
to
me
sang
giles
a
sprig
of
wild
flowers
in
his
gleaming
bascinet
his
upon
his
mailed
shoulder
and
strapped
to
his
wide
back
a
misshapen
bundle
that
clinked
melodiously
with
every
swinging
stride
and
while
he
sang
the
ragged
rogues
about
him
ceased
their
noise
and
ribaldry
to
hearken
in
delight
and
when
he
paused
cried
out
amain
for
more
whereupon
giles
nothing
loth
brake
forth
afresh
o
when
is
the
time
a
maid
to
kiss
tell
me
this
ah
tell
me
this
is
when
the
day
is
new
begun
is
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
is
time
for
kissing
ever
done
tell
me
this
ah
tell
me
this
thus
blithely
sang
giles
the
archer
above
the
tramp
and
jingle
of
the
many
until
being
come
to
the
top
of
a
hill
he
stood
aside
to
let
the
ragged
files
swing
by
and
stayed
to
look
back
at
garthlaxton
keep
now
as
he
stood
thus
beholding
that
mighty
flame
walkyn
and
roger
paused
beside
him
and
stood
to
scowl
upon
the
fire
with
never
a
word
betwixt
them
how
now
cried
giles
art
in
the
doleful
dumps
forsooth
on
so
blithe
a
morn
with
heavy
with
booty
and
garthlaxton
aflame
yonder
aha
is
a
rare
blaze
yon
a
fire
shall
warm
the
heart
of
many
a
sorry
wretch
methinks
truly
nodded
roger
i
have
seen
yon
flaming
keep
hung
round
with
hanged
men
ere
now
and
in
the
dungeons
beneath
i
have
seen
god
forgive
me
what
i
have
seen
ha
burn
accursed
walls
burn
full
many
shall
rejoice
in
thy
ruin
as
i
do
lorn
women
and
fatherless
children
fair
women
ravished
of
life
and
honour
aye
cried
giles
and
lovely
ladies
brought
to
shame
so
garthlaxton
smoke
and
quoth
frowning
walkyn
i
would
that
pertolepe
rank
carcass
smoked
with
thee
content
you
my
gentle
walkyn
nodded
the
archer
shall
have
him
yet
and
groweth
ever
hotter
against
the
day
content
you
so
away
with
melancholy
be
blithe
and
merry
as
i
am
and
the
throstles
yonder
the
wanton
rogues
ha
by
saint
giles
see
where
our
youthful
brother
rideth
his
brow
as
gloomy
as
his
hair
is
bright
ah
muttered
roger
he
grieveth
yet
for
beda
the
jester
and
he
but
a
fool
yet
a
fool
methinks
quoth
the
archer
but
for
our
tall
brother
now
he
is
changed
these
latter
days
he
groweth
harsh
methinks
and
something
ungentle
at
times
and
giles
thoughtfully
touched
his
arm
with
tentative
fingers
why
the
torment
is
apt
to
change
a
man
said
walkyn
i
have
tried
it
and
i
know
now
hereupon
giles
fell
to
whistling
walkyn
to
silence
and
roger
to
scowling
oft
looking
back
to
where
beltane
rode
a
black
his
thrown
back
his
chin
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
gloomy
and
wistful
and
as
often
as
he
looked
roger
sighed
amain
whereat
at
last
the
archer
cried
good
lack
roger
and
wherefore
puff
ye
so
why
glower
ye
man
and
snort
snort
thyself
growled
roger
nay
i
had
rather
talk
i
had
rather
be
silent
excellent
roger
so
will
i
talk
for
thee
and
me
first
will
i
show
three
excellent
reasons
for
happiness
the
birds
sing
i
talk
and
garthlaxton
i
would
thou
burn
with
it
growled
roger
but
here
is
a
deed
shall
live
when
thou
and
i
are
dust
archer
verily
good
roger
for
here
and
now
will
i
make
a
song
o
for
souls
unborn
to
sing
a
good
song
with
a
lilt
to
trip
it
lightly
on
the
tongue
as
thus
how
beltane
burned
garthlaxton
low
with
lusty
giles
whose
good
yew
bow
sped
many
a
caitiff
rogue
i
trow
how
exclaimed
roger
here
be
two
whole
lines
to
thy
knavish
self
and
but
one
to
our
master
aye
grumbled
walkyn
and
what
of
roger
what
of
me
we
were
there
also
methinks
nay
show
patience
said
giles
we
will
amend
that
in
the
next
triplet
thus
there
roger
fought
and
walkyn
too
and
giles
that
bare
the
bow
of
yew
o
swift
and
strong
his
arrows
flew
how
think
ye
of
that
now
i
think
here
is
too
much
giles
said
roger
forsooth
and
say
ye
so
indeed
let
us
then
to
another
verse
walkyn
a
mighty
axe
did
sway
black
roger
sword
some
few
did
slay
yet
giles
slew
many
more
than
they
here
now
we
have
each
one
his
line
apiece
which
is
fair
and
the
lines
trip
it
commendingly
how
think
ye
i
think
it
a
lie
growled
roger
aye
me
sighed
the
archer
fasting
rogerkin
and
an
empty
belly
ever
giveth
thee
an
ill
tongue
yet
for
thy
behoof
my
song
shall
be
ended
thus
they
gave
garthlaxton
to

and
three
or
four
of
eric
ragged
rogues
appeared
dragging
a
woman
betwixt

at

of

the
air
was
filled
with
fierce
shouts
and
cries

quoth
roger
spitting
and
drawing
a
cross
in
the
dust
with
his
with
the
eyes
of
an
angel
said
giles
pushing
nearer
where
stood
a
maid
young
and
shapely
trembling
in
the
close
grasp
of
one
gurth
a
ragged
giant
whose
glowing
eyes
stared
lustfully
upon
her
ripe
young
beauty
is
mellent
cried
the
fellow

that

escaped

thrice
by
deviltry
and
witchcraft
nay

the
maid
pallid

nought

but
a
poor
maid
gathering
herbs
and
simples
for
my
mother
ah
show

roared
a
score
of
voices
witch
not
so
in
sooth
in
very
sooth
she
gasped
sobs
of
terror
nought
but
a
poor
maid
am
i
and
the
man
thrice
sought
me
out
and
would
have
shamed
me
but
that
i
escaped
for
that
i
am
very
swift
of
foot
she
lured
me
into
the
bog
with
cried
gurth
and
would
thou
rotted
there
quoth
giles
o
the
bow
edging
nearer
now
hereupon
the
maid
turned
and
looked
at
giles
through
the
silken
curtain
of
her
black
and
glossy
hair
and
beholding
the
entreaty
of
that
look
the
virginal
purity
of
those
wide
blue
eyes
the
archer
stood
awed
and
silent
his
comely
face
grew
red
grew
pale
then
out
flashed
his
dagger
and
he
crouched
to
spring
on
gurth
but
of
a
sudden
beltane
rode
in
between
at
whose
coming
a
shout
went
up
and
thereafter
a
silence
fell
but
now
at
sight
of
beltane
the
uttered
a
strange
cry
and
shrinking
beneath
his
look
crouched
upon
her
knees
and
spake
in
strange
hushed
accents
messire
she
whispered
mine
eyes
do
tell
me
thou
art
the
lord
beltane
aye
is
so
ah
she
cried
now
glory
be
and
thanks
to
god
that
i
do
see
thee
hale
and
well
so
saying
she
shivered
and
covered
her
face
now
while
beltane
yet
stared
amazed
by
her
saying
the
bushes
parted
near
by
and
a
hooded
figure
stepped
forth
silent
and
soft
of
foot
at
sight
of
whom
all
men
gave
back
a
pace
and
roger
trembling
drew
a
second
cross
in
the
dust
with
his
what
time
a
shout
went
up
ha
the
witch
is
the
witch
of
hangstone
waste
herself
very
still
she
stood
looking
round
upon
them
all
with
eyes
that
glittered
the
shadow
of
her
hood
and
when
at
last
she
spake
her
voice
was
rich
and
sweet
to
hear
liar
she
said
and
pointed
at
gurth
a
long
white
finger
unhand
her
liar
lest
thou
wither
flesh
and
bone
body
and
soul
now
here
once
again
men
gave
back
cowering
her
glance
while
roger
crossed
himself
devoutly
the
evil
eye
he
muttered
chattering
teeth
cross
thy
fingers
giles
lest
she
blast
thee
but
gurth
shook
his
head
and
laughed
aloud
fools
he
cried
do
ye
forget
no
witch
hath
power
i
the
sun
she
can
work
no
evil
i
the
sunshine
seize
her
is
an
accursed
hag
seize
her
bring
her
to
the
water
and
see
an
she
can
swim
with
a
stone
at
her
hag
neck
all
witches
are
powerless
by
day
see
thus
i
spit
upon
and
defy
her
now
hereupon
a
roar
of
anger
went
up
and
for
that
they
had
feared
her
before
so
now
grew
they
more
fierce
a
score
of
eager
hands
dragged
at
her
hands
that
rent
her
cloak
that
grasped
with
cruel
fingers
at
her
long
grey
hair
bending
her
this
way
and
that
but
she
uttered
no
groan
nor
complaint
only
the
maid
cried
aloud
most
pitiful
to
hear
whereat
giles
dagger
in
hand
pushed
and
strove
to
come
at
gurth
then
beltane
alighted
from
his
horse
and
parting
the
throng
with
mailed
hands
stood
within
the
circle
and
looking
round
upon
them
laughed
and
his
laugh
was
harsh
and
bitter
forsooth
and
must
ye
war
with
helpless
women
o
men
of
pentavalon
quoth
he
and
laughed
again
right
scornfully
whereat
those
that
held
the
witch
relaxed
their
hold
and
fain
would
justify
themselves
she
is
a
witch
a
cursed
witch
they
cried
she
is
a
woman
says
beltane
aye
a
a
notable
witch
we
know
her
of
old
verily
cried
one
is
but
a
sennight
since
she
plagued
me
with
aching
teeth
and
me
with
an
ague
cried
another
she
bewitched
my
shafts
that
they
all
flew
wide
o
the
mark
cried
a
third
she
cast
on
me
a
spell
whereby
i
nigh
did
perish
i
the
fen
she
is
a
hag
she
and
shall
to
the
fire
they
shouted
amain
ha
witch
witch
that
doeth
no
man
harm
by
day
said
beltane
so
by
day
shall
no
man
harm
her
aye
lord
quoth
roger
but
how
by
night
is
by
night
she
may
work
her
spells
and
blast
any
that
she
will
or
haunt
them
with
goblins
damned
that
they
do
run
mad
or
enough
cried
beltane
frowning
on
me
let
her
bewitchments
fall
thus
see
you
an
i
within
this
next
week
wither
and
languish
her
spells
then
let
her
burn
an
ye
will
but
until
this
flesh
doth
shrivel
on
these
my
bones
no
man
shall
do
her
hurt
so
now
let
there
be
an
end
free
these
women
let
your
ranks
be
ordered
and
march
comrades
all
cried
gurth
will
ye
be
slaves
henceforth
to
this
youth
we
have
arms
now
and
rich
booty
let
us
back
to
the
merry
greenwood
where
all
men
are
equal
come
let
us
be
gone
and
take
these
witches
with
us
to
our
sport
but
in
this
moment
beltane
turned
quotha
he
cried
and
beholding
his
look
gurth
of
a
sudden
loosed
the
swooning
maid
and
drawing
sword
leapt
and
smote
at
beltane
golden
head
but
beltane
caught
the
blow
in
his
mailed
hand
and
snapped
the
blade
in
sunder
and
seizing
gurth
about
the
loins
whirled
him
high
in
air
then
while
all
men
blenched
and
held
their
breath
waiting
the
thud
of
his
broken
body
in
the
dust
beltane
stayed
and
set
him
down
upon
his
feet
and
lo
gurth
cheek
was
pale
his
eye
wide
and
vacant
and
his
soul
sat
numbed
within
him
so
beltane
took
him
by
the
throat
and
laughing
fierce
shook
him
to
and
fro
beast
said
he
unfit
art
thou
to
march
with
these
my
comrades
now
therefore
do
i
cast
thee
out
take
thy
life
and
go
and
let
any
follow
thee
that
will
pentavalon
needeth
not
thy
kind
get
thee
from
among
us
as
i
found
thee
thy
share
of
treasure
shall
go
to
better
men
now
even
as
beltane
spake
gurth
red
head
sank
until
his
face
was
hidden
within
his
hands
strong
hands
that
slowly
clenched
themselves
into
fists
and
ever
as
beltane
spake
the
witch
tossing
back
her
long
grey
hair
looked
and
looked
on
him
with
bright
and
eager
eyes
a
wondering
look
quick
to
note
his
shape
and
goodly
size
his
wide
blue
eyes
his
long
and
golden
hair
and
the
proud
high
carriage
of
his
head
and
slowly
to
her
wonderment
came
awe
and
growing
joy
but
beltane
spake
on
unheeding
thou
dost
know
me
for
a
hunted
man
with
a
price
upon
my
head
but
thou
art
thing
so
poor
thy
death
can
pleasure
no
man
so
take
thy
life
and
get
thee
hence
but
come
not
again
for
in
that
same
hour
will
i
hang
thee
in
a
halter
go
so
with
drooping
head
gurth
of
the
red
hair
turned
him
about
and
plunging
into
the
green
was
gone
then
beltane
looked
awhile
upon
the
others
that
stood
shifting
on
their
feet
and
with
never
a
word
betwixt
them
comrades
quoth
he
mighty
deeds
do
lie
before
us
such
works
as
only
true
men
may
achieve
and
what
is
a
man
a
man
methinks
is
he
that
when
he
speaketh
speaketh
ever
from
his
heart
that
being
quick
to
hate
all
evil
actions
is
quicker
to
forgive
and
who
fearing
neither
ghost
nor
devil
spells
nor
witchcraft
dreadeth
only
dishonour
and
thus
living
without
fear
he
without
fear
may
die
so
now
god
send
we
all
be
men
my
brothers
to
your
files
there
pikes
to
the
front
and
rear
bows
to
the
flanks
forward
but
now
as
with
a
ring
and
clash
and
tramp
of
feet
the
ragged
company
fell
into
rank
and
order
the
came
swiftly
beside
beltane
and
touching
him
not
spake
softly
in
his
ear
beltane
beltane
lord
duke
of
pentavalon
now
hereupon
beltane
started
and
turning
looked
upon
her
what
would
ye
woman
he
questioned
born
wert
thou
of
a
mother
chaste
as
fair
true
wife
unto
the
duke
thy
father
a
woman
sweet
and
holy
who
liveth
but
to
the
good
of
others
yet
was
brother
slain
by
brother
and
thou
baptised
in
blood
ere
now
woman
quoth
he
his
strong
hands
who
art
thou
what
knowest
thou
of
my
mother
speak
not
here
my
lord
but
an
thou
learn
more
come
unto
hangstone
waste
at
the
full
o
the
moon
stand
you
where
the
stands
that
some
do
call
the
white
there
shalt
thou
learn
many
things
perchance
thou
hast
this
day
saved
a
witch
from
cruel
death
and
a
lowly
from
shame
a
witch
a
the
times
be
out
a
joint
methinks
yet
witch
and
beggar
do
we
thank
thee
lord
duke
fare
thee
well
until
the
full
o
the
moon
so
spake
she
and
clasping
the
young
maid
within
her
arm
they
passed
into
the
brush
and
so
were
gone
now
while
beltane
stood
yet
pondering
her
words
came
roger
to
his
side
to
touch
him
humbly
on
the
arm
lord
said
he
be
not
beguiled
by
yon
foul
witches
arts
go
not
to
hangstone
waste
lest
she
thee
with
goblins
or
transform
thee
to
a
loathly
toad
thou
wilt
not
go
master
at
the
full
o
the
moon
roger
why
then
muttered
roger
gulping
and
clenching
trembling
hands
we
must
needs
be
blasted
and
everlastingly
damned
for
needs
must
i
go
with
thee
very
soon
pike
and
bow
and
gisarm
fell
into
array
the
stumbled
forward
the
dust
rose
upon
the
warm
still
air
now
as
they
strode
along
with
ring
and
clash
and
the
sound
of
voice
and
laughter
came
giles
to
walk
at
beltane
stirrup
and
oft
he
glanced
back
along
the
way
and
oft
he
sighed
a
thing
most
rare
in
him
at
last
he
spake
and
dolefully
witchcraft
is
forsooth
a
deadly
sin
tall
brother
verily
giles
yet
there
be
worse
methinks
worse
ha
is
true
is
very
true
nodded
the
archer
and
then
forsooth
shall
the
mother
sin
cleave
unto
the
daughter
and
she
so
wondrous
fair
the
saints
forbid
now
hereupon
the
archer
gloom
was
lifted
and
he
strode
along
singing
softly
his
breath
yet
in
a
while
he
frowned
sudden
and
fierce
as
for
that
foul
knave
gurth
ha
methinks
i
had
been
wiser
to
slit
his
roguish
weasand
for
is
in
my
mind
he
may
live
to
discover
our
hiding
place
to
our
foes
and
perchance
bring
down
red
pertolepe
to
hundleby
fen
in
truth
said
beltane
slow
and
thoughtful
so
do
i
think
was
for
this
i
spared
his
life
now
here
giles
the
archer
turned
and
stared
upon
beltane
with
jaws
agape
and
fain
he
would
have
questioned
further
but
beltane
gloomy
brow
forbade
yet
oft
he
looked
askance
at
that
golden
head
and
oft
he
sighed
and
shook
his
own
what
time
they
marched
out
of
the
golden
glare
of
morning
into
the
dense
green
depths
of
the
forest
chapter
xxxii
how
beltane
met
with
a
youthful
knight
now
at
this
time
the
fame
of
beltane
doing
went
throughout
the
duchy
insomuch
that
divers
and
many
were
they
that
sought
him
out
within
the
green
masterless
men
serfs
from
thraldom
desperate
fellows
beyond
the
law
thieves
and
rogues
in
dire
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb
these
of
camp
and
town
and
village
hither
come
seeking
shelter
with
beltane
in
the
wild
wood
and
eager
for
his
service
in
very
truth
a
turbulent
company
this
prone
to
swift
quarrel
and
deadly
brawl
but
at
these
times
fiercer
than
any
was
walkyn
o
the
axe
grimmer
than
any
was
roger
the
black
whereas
giles
was
quick
as
his
tongue
and
eric
calm
and
resolute
four
mighty
men
were
these
but
mightier
than
all
was
beltane
wherefore
at
this
time
beltane
set
himself
to
bring
order
from
chaos
and
to
teach
these
wild
men
the
virtues
of
obedience
but
here
indeed
was
a
hard
matter
for
these
were
lawless
men
and
very
fierce
withal
but
upon
a
morning
ere
the
sun
had
chased
the
rosy
mists
into
marsh
and
fen
beltane
strode
forth
from
the
cave
wherein
he
slept
and
lifting
the
hunting
horn
he
bare
about
his
neck
sounded
it
fierce
and
shrill
whereon
rose
a
sudden
uproar
and
out
from
their
caves
from
hollowed
within
the
rocks
stumbled
his
ragged
following
an
unordered
rabblement
unarmed
that
ran
hither
and
thither
shouting
and
rubbing
sleep
from
their
eyes
or
stared
fearfully
upon
the
dawn
anon
beltane
sounded
again
whereat
they
beholding
him
came
thronging
about
him
and
questioned
him
eagerly
on
all
sides
as
thus
master
are
we
attacked
forsooth
is
the
red
pertolepe
upon
us
lord
what
shall
we
do
lead
us
master
lead
us
then
looking
upon
their
wild
disorder
beltane
laughed
for
scorn
rats
quoth
he
o
rats
is
it
thus
ye
throng
to
the
slaughter
then
were
i
in
sooth
red
pertolepe
with
but
a
score
at
my
back
i
had
slain
ye
all
ere
where
be
your
where
be
your
sentinels
are
ye
so
eager
to
kick
within
a
hangman
noose
now
hereupon
divers
growled
or
muttered
threateningly
while
others
yawning
would
have
turned
them
back
to
sleep
but
striding
among
them
beltane
stayed
them
with
voice
and
hand
and
voice
was
scornful
and
hand
was
heavy
moreover
beside
him
stood
roger
and
giles
with
walkyn
and
eric
of
the
wry
neck
fools
he
cried
for
that
pentavalon
doth
need
men
so
now
must
i
teach
ye
other
ways
fall
to
your
ranks
there
ha
scowl
and
ye
will
but
use
well
your
ears
mark
me
now
but
two
nights
ago
we
burned
down
my
lord
duke
great
castle
of
garthlaxton
think
you
my
lord
duke
will
not
seek
vengeance
dire
upon
these
our
bodies
therefore
think
ye
the
red
pertolepe
will
not
be
eager
for
our
blood
but
when
i
might
have
slain
yon
knavish
gurth
i
suffered
him
to
go
and
wherefore
for
that
gurth
being
at
heart
a
traitor
and
rogue
ingrain
might
straightway
his
him
to
the
duke
at
barham
broom
with
offers
to
guide
his
powers
hither
but
when
they
be
come
his
chivalry
and
heavy
armed
foot
here
within
the
green
then
will
we
fire
the
woods
about
them
and
from
every
point
of
vantage
beset
them
with
our
arrows
ha
bows
bows
cried
giles
tossing
up
his
and
catching
it
featly
oho
tall
brother
fair
lord
duke
here
is
a
sweet
and
notable
counsel
ha
bows
hey
for
bows
and
bills
i
the
merry
greenwood
so
perceive
me
quoth
beltane
thus
shall
the
hunters
peradventure
become
the
hunted
for
an
duke
ivo
come
is
like
enough
he
shall
win
free
of
our
ring
of
fire
now
from
these
long
and
ragged
ranks
a
buzz
arose
that
swelled
and
swelled
to
a
fierce
shout
the
fire
they
cried
ha
to
burn
them
i
the
fire
but
so
to
do
quoth
beltane
rats
must
become
wolves
valiant
men
ye
are
i
know
yet
are
ye
but
a
poor
unordered
rabblement
mete
for
slaughter
so
now
will
i
teach
ye
how
here
within
the
we
may
withstand
black
ivo
and
all
his
powers
giles
bring
now
the
book
of
clean
parchment
i
took
from
garthlaxton
together
with
pens
and
and
it
shall
be
henceforth
a
record
of
us
every
one
our
names
our
number
and
the
good
or
ill
we
each
one
do
achieve
so
there
and
then
while
the
sun
rose
high
and
higher
and
the
mists
of
dawn
thinned
and
vanished
the
record
was
begun
two
hundred
and
twenty
and
four
they
mustered
and
the
name
of
each
and
every
giles
duly
wrote
down
within
the
book
in
right
fair
and
clerkly
hand
thereafter
beltane
numbered
them
into
four
companies
over
the
first
company
he
set
walkyn
over
the
second
giles
over
the
third
roger
and
over
the
fourth
eric
of
the
wry
neck
moreover
he
caused
to
be
brought
all
the
armour
they
had
won
and
ordered
that
all
men
should
henceforth
go
armed
from
head
to
foot
yet
many
there
were
that
needs
must
go
short
awhile
now
he
ordained
these
four
companies
should
keep
watch
and
watch
day
and
night
with
sentinels
and
outposts
in
the
green
and
when
they
murmured
at
this
he
stared
them
into
silence
fools
said
he
an
ye
would
lie
secure
so
must
ye
watch
constantly
against
surprise
and
furthermore
shall
ye
exercise
daily
now
at
the
spoke
command
to
address
your
pikes
charge
of
horse
or
foot
and
to
that
company
adjudged
the
best
and
stoutest
will
i
each
week
give
store
of
money
from
my
share
of
booty
so
now
walkyn
summon
ye
your
company
and
get
to
your
ward
thus
it
was
that
slowly
out
of
chaos
came
order
yet
it
came
not
unopposed
for
many
and
divers
were
they
that
growled
against
this
new
order
of
things
but
beltane
hand
was
swift
and
heavy
moreover
remembering
how
he
had
dealt
with
tostig
they
growled
amain
but
hasted
to
obey
so
in
place
of
idleness
was
work
and
instead
of
quarrel
and
riot
was
peace
among
the
wild
men
and
a
growing
content
insomuch
that
upon
a
certain
balmy
eve
giles
the
archer
lolling
beside
the
fire
looking
upon
black
roger
who
sat
beside
him
furbishing
his
spake
his
mind
on
this
wise
mark
ye
these
wolves
of
ours
sweet
roger
there
hath
been
no
betwixt
them
these
four
days
and
scarce
a
quarrel
roger
aye
this
comes
of
my
lord
my
master
hath
a
wondrous
tongue
giles
giles
my
hath
a
wondrous
strong
fist
rogerkin
roger
thy
archer
thine
forsooth
ha
giles
snort
not
my
gentle
roger
for
i
fell
in
company
with
him
ere
he
knew
aught
of
thee
so
thy
snort
availeth
nothing
my
rogerkin
howbeit
our
snarling
wolves
do
live
like
tender
lambs
these
days
the
which
doth
but
go
to
prove
how
blessed
a
thing
is
a
fist
a
fist
mark
you
strong
to
strike
big
to
buffet
and
swift
to
smite
a
capable
fist
roger
to
strike
buffet
and
smite
a
man
to
the
good
of
his
soul
roger
in
sooth
my
master
is
a
noble
knight
shall
we
see
his
equal
and
yet
giles
methinks
he
doth
mope
and
grieve
these
days
he
groweth
and
careworn
harsh
of
speech
and
swift
to
anger
behold
him
now
and
roger
pointed
to
where
beltane
sat
apart
as
was
become
his
wont
of
late
his
axe
betwixt
his
knees
square
chin
propped
upon
clenched
fist
scowling
into
the
fire
that
burned
before
his
whence
cometh
the
so
great
change
in
him
think
you
giles
for
that
while
i
am
i
and
he
is
himself
thou
art
but
what
thou
art
my
rogerkin
well
enough
after
thy
fashion
mayhap
but
after
all
thou
art
only
thyself
ha
growled
roger
and
what
of
thee
archer
i
am
his
rogerkin
and
so
know
him
therefore
as
a
wondrous
lord
a
noble
knight
a
goodly
youth
and
a
sweet
lad
some
day
when
i
grow
too
old
to
bear
arms
i
will
to
pen
and
and
will
make
of
him
a
ballade
that
shall
mayhap
outlive
our
time
a
notable
ballade
something
on
this
wise
of
gentle
beltane
i
will
tell
a
knight
who
did
all
knights
excel
who
loved
of
all
men
here
below
his
faithful
giles
that
bare
the
bow
for
giles
full
strong
and
straight
could
shoot
a
goodly
man
was
giles
to
boot
a
lusty
fighter
sure
was
giles
in
counsel
sage
and
full
of
wiles
and
giles
was
handsome
giles
was
young
and
giles
he
had
a
merry
how
now
roger
man
wherefore
interrupt
me
for
that
there
be
too
many
of
giles
hereabouts
and
one
giles
talketh
enough
for
twenty
so
will
i
to
walkyn
that
seldom
talketh
enough
for
one
so
saying
roger
arose
donned
his
shirt
of
mail
and
buckling
his
sword
about
him
strode
incontinent
away
and
in
a
while
beltane
arose
also
and
climbing
one
of
the
many
precipitous
paths
answered
the
challenge
of
sentinel
and
outpost
and
went
on
as
one
heavy
in
thought
yet
with
eyes
quick
to
heed
how
thick
was
the
underbrush
hereabouts
with
dead
wood
and
bracken
apt
to
firing
before
him
rose
an
upland
crowned
by
a
belt
of
mighty
forest
trees
and
beyond
a
road
or
rather
track
that
dipped
and
wound
away
into
the
haze
of
evening
presently
as
he
walked
beneath
this
leafy
twilight
he
heard
the
luring
sound
of
running
water
and
turning
thither
laid
him
down
where
was
a
small
and
placid
pool
for
he
was
athirst
but
as
he
stooped
to
drink
he
started
and
thereafter
hung
above
this
pellucid
mirror
staring
down
at
the
face
that
stared
up
at
him
with
eyes
agleam
lowering
brows
above
whose
gloom
a
lock
of
hair
gleamed
amid
the
yellow
long
stayed
he
thus
to
mark
the
fierce
curve
of
nostril
the
square
grimness
of
jaw
and
chin
and
the
lips
that
met
in
a
harsh
line
and
relentless
and
gazing
thus
upon
his
image
he
spake
beneath
his
breath
o
lady
o
wilful
helen
thy
soft
white
hand
hath
set
its
mark
upon
me
the
youth
is
grown
a
man
meseemeth
well
so
be
it
thus
saying
he
laughed
harshly
and
stooping
drank
his
fill
now
as
he
yet
lay
beside
the
brook
hearkening
to
its
pretty
babel
he
was
aware
of
another
sound
drawing
nearer
the
slow
plodding
of
a
horse
hoofs
upon
the
road
below
and
glancing
whence
it
came
he
beheld
a
solitary
knight
whose
mail
gleamed
a
rich
surcoat
and
whose
shield
flamed
red
with
sunset
while
beltane
yet
watched
this
solitary
rider
behold
two
figures
that
crouched
in
the
underbrush
growing
beside
the
way
stealthy
figures
that
flitted
from
tree
to
tree
and
bush
to
bush
keeping
pace
with
the
horseman
and
as
they
came
nearer
beltane
saw
that
these
men
who
crouched
and
stole
so
swift
and
purposeful
were
walkyn
and
black
roger
near
and
nearer
they
drew
the
trackers
and
the
tracked
till
they
were
come
to
a
place
where
the
underbrush
fell
away
and
cover
there
was
none
and
here
very
suddenly
forth
leapt
roger
with
walkyn
at
his
heels
up
reared
the
startled
horse
and
thereafter
the
knight
was
dragged
from
his
saddle
and
walkyn
terrible
axe
swung
aloft
for
the
blow
but
black
roger
turned
and
caught
walkyn
arm
and
so
they
strove
together
furiously
what
time
the
knight
lay
upon
the
ling
and
stirred
not
ha
fool
raged
walkyn
loose
my
arm
what
would
ye
shalt
not
slay
him
cried
roger
is
a
notch
is
a
notch
from
my
accursed
belt
shalt
not
slay
him
i
tell
thee
now
out
upon
thee
for
a
mad
knave
quoth
walkyn
knave
thyself
roared
black
roger
and
so
they
wrestled
fiercely
together
but
little
by
little
walkyn
size
and
bull
strength
began
to
tell
whereupon
back
sprang
nimble
roger
and
as
walkyn
axe
gleamed
so
gleamed
roger
sword
but
now
as
they
circled
warily
about
each
other
seeking
an
opening
for
blow
or
thrust
there
came
a
rush
of
feet
and
beltane
leapt
betwixt
them
and
bestriding
the
fallen
knight
fronted
them
in
black
and
bitter
anger
ha
rogues
he
cried
art
become
thieves
and
murderers
so
soon
then
shed
each
other
blood
for
lust
of
booty
like
any
other
lawless
knaves
forsooth
shame
o
shame
on
ye
both
so
saying
he
stooped
and
lifting
the
unconscious
knight
flung
him
across
his
shoulder
and
strode
off
leaving
the
twain
to
stare
upon
each
other
scowling
and
beltane
descended
into
the
hollow
whereupon
up
sprang
giles
with
divers
others
and
would
have
looked
upon
and
aided
with
the
captive
but
beholding
beltane
frown
they
stayed
their
questions
and
stood
from
his
path
so
came
he
to
a
certain
cave
hollowed
within
the
one
of
many
such
but
the
rough
walls
of
this
cave
black
roger
had
adorned
with
a
rich
arras
and
had
prepared
also
a
bed
of
costly
furs
here
beltane
laid
the
captive
and
sitting
within
the
mouth
of
the
cave
beyond
which
a
fire
burned
fell
to
scowling
at
the
flame
and
presently
as
he
sat
thus
came
roger
and
walkyn
who
fain
would
have
made
their
peace
but
beltane
fiercely
bade
them
to
begone
lord
quoth
walkyn
fumbling
with
his
axe
we
found
this
knight
hard
by
so
lest
he
should
disclose
the
secret
of
this
our
haven
i
would
have
slain
him
master
said
roger
is
true
i
had
a
mind
to
his
horse
and
armour
since
we
do
such
things
lack
yet
would
i
have
saved
him
alive
and
cut
from
my
belt
another
accursed
notch
so
art
thou
a
fool
roger
quoth
walkyn
for
an
this
knight
live
this
our
refuge
is
secret
no
longer
ha
sneered
beltane
what
matter
for
that
an
it
shelter
but
murderers
and
thieving
knaves
dost
name
me
murderer
growled
walkyn
and
me
a
thief
master
sighed
roger
i
that
am
thy
man
that
would
but
have
borrowed
peace
cried
beltane
hence
begone
and
leave
me
to
my
thoughts
hereupon
walkyn
turned
and
strode
away
twirling
his
axe
but
roger
went
and
with
head
what
time
beltane
frowned
into
the
fire
his
scowl
blacker
than
ever
but
as
he
sat
thus
from
the
gloom
of
the
cave
behind
him
a
voice
spake
a
soft
voice
and
low
at
sound
whereof
he
started
and
turned
him
about
meseemeth
thy
thoughts
are
evil
messire
of
a
verity
sir
knight
for
needs
must
i
think
of
women
and
the
ways
of
women
am
i
haunted
of
bitter
memory
now
of
a
sudden
the
stranger
knight
beholding
beltane
in
the
light
of
the
fire
started
up
to
his
elbow
to
stare
and
stare
then
quailing
shivering
shrank
away
hiding
his
face
within
his
mailed
hands
whereat
spake
beltane
in
amaze
how
now
sir
knight
art
sick
in
faith
dost
ail
of
some
wound
not
so
ah
god
not
so
those
fetters
upon
thy
wrists
messire
alack
sir
knight
laughed
beltane
and
is
it
my
looks
afflict
thee
so
is
true
we
be
wild
rogues
hereabout
evil
company
for
gentle
knights
amongst
us
ye
shall
find
men
new
broke
from
the
and
desperate
knaves
for
whom
the
dungeon
yawns
as
for
me
these
gyves
upon
my
wrists
were
riveted
there
by
folly
for
fool
is
he
that
trusteth
to
woman
and
the
ways
of
woman
so
will
i
wear
them
henceforth
until
my
work
be
done
to
mind
me
of
my
folly
and
of
one
i
loved
so
much
i
would
that
she
had
died
ere
that
she
slew
my
love
for
her
thus
spake
beltane
staring
ever
into
the
fire
joying
bitterly
to
voice
his
grief
unto
this
strange
knight
who
had
risen
softly
and
now
stood
upon
the
other
side
of
the
fire
and
looking
upon
him
in
a
while
beltane
saw
that
he
was
but
a
youth
slender
and
shapely
in
his
rich
surcoat
and
costly
mail
the
which
laced
close
about
cheek
and
chin
showed
little
of
his
face
below
the
gleaming
bascinet
yet
that
little
and
pale
sir
knight
said
beltane
free
art
thou
to
go
hence
nor
shall
any
stay
or
spoil
thee
yet
first
hear
this
thou
art
perchance
some
roving
knight
seeking
adventure
to
the
glory
and
honour
of
some
fair
lady
o
folly
choose
you
something
more
worthy
a
horse
is
a
noble
beast
and
dogs
they
say
are
faithful
but
see
you
a
woman
love
is
a
pitiful
thing
at
best
while
dogs
and
horses
be
give
not
thine
heart
into
a
woman
hand
lest
she
tear
it
in
her
soft
white
fingers
set
not
thine
honour
beneath
her
shapely
feet
lest
she
tread
it
into
the
shameful
mire
so
fare
thee
well
sir
knight
god
go
with
thee
and
keep
thee
ever
from
the
love
of
woman
so
saying
beltane
rose
and
lifting
the
he
wore
sounded
it
whereon
came
all
and
sundry
running
and
with
weapons
brandished
but
roger
first
of
all
to
all
of
whom
beltane
spake
thus
behold
here
this
gentle
knight
our
guest
is
for
the
nonce
entreat
him
courteously
therefore
give
him
all
that
he
doth
lack
and
thereafter
set
him
upon
his
way
but
hereupon
divers
cast
evil
looks
upon
the
knight
murmuring
among
themselves
and
loudest
of
all
walkyn
he
knoweth
the
secret
of
our
is
said
he
knoweth
the
causeway
through
the
fen
he
will
betray
us
dogs
said
beltane
clenching
his
hands
will
ye
defy
me
then
i
say
this
knight
shall
go
hence
and
none
withstand
him
make
way
then
or
must
i
but
now
spake
the
youthful
knight
his
gaze
still
bent
upon
the
flame
nor
seemed
he
to
heed
the
fierce
faces
and
eager
steel
that
girt
him
round
nay
messire
for
here
methinks
my
quest
is
ended
thy
quest
sir
knight
how
so
then
the
knight
turned
and
looked
upon
beltane
quoth
he
by
thy
size
and
knightly
gear
by
thy
thy
yellow
hair
methinks
thou
art
beltane
son
of
beltane
the
strong
verily
is
so
that
i
am
called
what
would
you
of
me
this
messire
herewith
the
stranger
knight
loosed
belt
and
surcoat
and
drew
forth
a
long
sword
whose
broad
blade
glittered
in
the
firelight
and
gave
its
massy
hilt
to
beltane
grasp
and
looking
upon
its
shining
blade
beltane
beheld
the
graven
legend
resurgam
now
looking
upon
this
beltane
drew
a
deep
slow
breath
and
turned
upon
the
youthful
knight
with
eyes
grown
suddenly
fierce
quoth
he
softly
whence
had
you
this
sir
knight
from
one
that
liveth
but
for
thee
ah
said
beltane
with
scornful
lip
know
ye
such
an
one
in
faith
aye
messire
spake
the
knight
yet
eager
one
that
doth
languish
for
thee
that
hath
sent
me
in
quest
of
thee
bearing
this
thy
sword
for
a
sign
and
to
bid
thee
to
return
since
without
thee
life
is
an
emptiness
and
there
is
none
so
poor
so
and
woeful
as
helen
of
mortain
ah
liar
cried
beltane
and
reaching
out
fierce
hands
crushed
the
speaker
to
his
knees
but
even
so
the
young
knight
spake
on
and
calm
of
eye
greater
than
thine
is
her
love
for
thee
methinks
since
is
changeless
and
abiding
slay
me
an
thou
wilt
but
while
i
live
i
will
declare
her
true
to
thee
whatever
hath
chanced
may
chance
despite
all
doubts
and
enemies
she
doth
love
love
love
thee
through
life
till
death
and
beyond
o
my
lord
beltane
liar
spake
beltane
again
but
now
was
he
seized
of
a
madness
a
cold
rage
and
a
deadly
liar
said
he
thou
art
methinks
one
of
her
many
wooers
so
art
thou
greater
fool
but
helen
the
beautiful
hath
lovers
and
being
what
she
is
shall
nothing
miss
thee
howbeit
thou
art
surely
liar
and
surely
will
i
slay
thee
so
saying
he
swung
aloft
the
great
blade
but
even
so
the
young
knight
fronted
the
blow
with
eyes
that
quailed
not
yet
smiling
and
serene
and
then
or
ever
the
stroke
could
fall
an
arm
bronzed
and
hairy
came
between
and
roger
spake
master
he
cried
for
that
thy
man
am
i
and
love
thee
shalt
do
this
till
hast
first
slain
me
is
thus
thou
teach
me
to
show
mercy
to
the
weak
and
helpless
and
this
is
a
youth
unarmed
bethink
thee
master
o
bethink
thee
slowly
beltane
arm
sank
and
looking
upon
the
bright
blade
he
let
it
fall
upon
the
ling
and
covered
his
face
within
his
two
hands
as
if
its
glitter
had
blinded
him
thus
did
he
stand
awhile
the
fetters
agleam
upon
his
wrists
and
thereafter
fell
upon
his
knees
and
with
his
face
yet
hidden
spake
walkyn
said
he
o
walkyn
but
a
little
while
since
i
named
thee
yet
what
in
sooth
am
i
so
now
do
i
humbly
ask
thy
pardon
as
for
thee
sir
knight
grant
thy
pity
to
one
that
is
abased
had
i
tears
now
might
i
shed
them
but
tears
are
not
for
me
go
you
therefore
to
to
her
that
sent
thee
and
say
that
beltane
died
within
the
dungeons
of
garthlaxton
say
that
i
who
speak
am
but
a
sword
for
the
hand
of
god
henceforth
to
smite
and
stay
not
until
wrong
shall
be
driven
hence
say
that
this
was
told
thee
by
a
sorry
wight
who
yearning
for
death
must
needs
cherish
life
until
his
vow
be
accomplished
but
as
beltane
spake
thus
upon
his
knees
his
head
bowed
humbly
before
them
all
the
young
knight
came
near
with
mailed
hands
outstretched
yet
touched
him
not
messire
said
he
thou
hast
craved
of
me
a
boon
the
which
i
do
most
full
and
freely
grant
but
now
would
i
beg
one
of
thee
is
thine
quoth
beltane
who
am
i
to
gainsay
thee
messire
is
this
that
thou
wilt
take
me
to
serve
thee
to
go
beside
thee
sharing
thy
woes
and
perils
henceforth
so
be
it
sir
knight
answered
beltane
though
mine
shall
be
a
hazardous
service
mayhap
so
when
ye
will
thou
shalt
be
free
of
it
thus
saying
he
arose
and
went
aside
and
sat
him
down
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
but
in
a
while
came
roger
to
him
his
in
his
hand
and
looked
upon
his
gloomy
face
with
eyes
full
troubled
and
presently
he
spake
yet
halting
in
his
speech
and
timid
master
he
said
suffer
me
a
question
verily
quoth
beltane
looking
up
as
many
as
thou
wilt
my
faithful
roger
master
says
roger
twisting
and
turning
the
belt
in
hairy
hands
i
would
but
ask
thee
if
if
i
might
cut
another
notch
from
this
my
accursed
belt
a
notch
lord
i
the
young
knight
you
mean
him
that
i
would
have
murdered
roger
reach
me
hither
thy
belt
so
beltane
took
the
belt
and
with
his
dagger
cut
thence
two
notches
whereat
quoth
roger
staring
lord
i
did
but
save
one
life
the
young
knight
thou
save
two
answered
beltane
for
had
i
slain
him
roger
o
had
i
slain
him
then
on
this
night
have
hanged
me
for
a
murderer
here
be
two
notches
for
thee
so
take
back
thy
belt
and
go
get
thee
to
thy
rest
and
roger
pray
for
one
that
tasteth
death
in
life
so
roger
took
the
belt
and
turning
softly
left
beltane
crouched
above
the
fire
as
one
that
is
deadly
cold
chapter
xxxiii
how
beltane
had
news
of
one
that
was
a
notable
pardoner
beltane
awoke
to
the
shrill
notes
of
a
horn
and
starting
to
sleepy
elbow
heard
the
call
and
challenge
of
sentinel
and
outpost
from
the
bank
above
thereafter
presently
appeared
giles
that
chanced
to
be
captain
of
the
watch
very
joyously
haling
along
a
little
man
placid
and
rotund
a
plump
little
man
whose
sober
habit
smacking
of
things
ecclesiastic
was
at
odds
with
his
face
that
beamed
forth
jovial
and
rubicund
from
the
shade
of
his
hat
a
hat
adorned
with
many
small
pewter
images
of
divers
saints
about
his
waist
was
a
girdle
where
hung
a
goodly
wallet
plump
like
himself
and
eke
as
well
filled
a
right
buxom
wight
was
he
comfortable
and
round
who
though
hurried
along
in
the
archer
lusty
grip
smiled
placidly
and
spake
him
sweetly
thus
hug
me
not
so
lovingly
good
youth
abate
abate
thy
hold
upon
my
tender
nape
lest
sweet
lad
the
holy
saint
amphibalus
strike
thee
deaf
dumb
blind
and
latterly
dead
trot
me
not
so
hastily
lest
the
good
saint
alban
cast
thy
poor
soul
into
a
hell
seventy
times
heated
and
be
a
sad
o
me
a
very
sad
thing
that
thou
sniff
brimstone
on
my
account
why
giles
quoth
beltane
blinking
in
the
dawn
what
dost
bring
hither
so
early
in
the
morning
lord
is
what
they
call
a
pardoner
that
dealeth
in
relics
mouldy
bones
and
the
like
see
you
whereby
they
do
pretend
to
divers
miracles
and
wonders
verily
verily
nodded
the
little
man
placidly
i
have
here
in
my
wallet
a
twig
from
moses
burning
bush
with
the
great
toe
of
thomas
didymus
the
thumb
of
the
blessed
saint
alban
ha
rogue
quoth
giles
when
i
was
a
monk
we
had
four
thumbs
of
the
good
saint
alban
why
then
content
you
fond
youth
smiled
the
pardoner
my
thumb
is
number
one
oh
tall
brother
quoth
giles
is
an
irreverent
knave
that
maketh
the
monk
in
me
arise
my
very
toes
do
twitch
for
to
kick
his
lewd
and
sacrilegious
carcase
and
lord
he
would
kick
wondrous
soft
and
therein
sweet
and
gentle
lord
beamed
the
little
buxom
man
therein
lieth
a
recommendation
of
itself
divers
noble
lords
have
kicked
me
very
familiarly
ere
now
and
finding
me
soft
and
tender
have
forthwith
kicked
again
i
mind
my
lord
duke
ivo
did
with
his
own
ducal
foot
kick
me
right
heartily
upon
a
time
and
once
did
spit
upon
my
cloak
i
can
show
you
the
very
place
and
these
things
do
breed
and
argue
familiarity
thus
have
i
been
familiar
with
divers
noble
lords
and
there
were
ladies
also
ladies
fair
and
proud
o
me
now
by
the
rood
says
beltane
sitting
up
and
staring
whence
had
you

giles
my
lord
was
found
by
the
man
jenkyn
snoring
within
the
green
together
with
a
mule
a
sorry
beast
a
capon
partly
devoured
a
pasty
well
spiced
and
a
empty

you
of
your
tears
are
ye
a
sinner
vile
and
damnèd
within
my
wallet
lie
pardons
galore
with
powerful
indulgences
whereby
a
man
may
enjoy
all
the
cardinal
sins
yet
shall
his
soul
be
accounted
innocent
as
a
babe
unborn
and
his
flesh
go
without
penance
here
behold

special
indulgence

cried
beltane
surely

sins
enough
for
any
man
not
so
potent
sir
for
is
a
right
sinful
world
and
breedeth
new
sins
every
day
since
man
hath
a
rare
invention
that
way
here
is
a
grievous
thing
alas
yet
something
natural
for
since
men
are
human
and
human
is
to
sin
so
must
all
men
be
sinners
and
being
sinners
are
they
therefore
inevitably
damned
alas
for
poor
humanity
sighed
beltane
forsooth
alas
indeed
messire
and
likewise
woe
nodded
the
pardoner
for
thou
my
lord
thou
art
but
human
after
all
indeed
at
times
almost
seem
so
nodded
beltane
gravely
and
therefore
quoth
the
pardoner
and
therefore
most
noble
gentle
lord
art
thou
most
assuredly
and
inevitably
the
pardoner
sighed
damned
said
beltane
damned
sighed
the
pardoner
along
with
the
rest
of
humanity
nodded
beltane
all
men
be
more
prone
to
sin
when
youth
doth
riot
in
their
veins
quoth
the
pardoner
and
alas
thou
art
very
young
messire
so
do
i
tremble
for
thee
yet
with
each
hour
do
i
grow
older
and
behold
in
this
hour
come
i
declaring
to
thee
there
is
no
sin
so
vile
but
that
through
me
holy
church
shall
grant
thee
remission
at
a
price
a
price
good
pardoner
why
there
be
sins
great
and
sins
little
but
youthful
sir
for
thine
own
damnable
doings
grieve
not
mope
not
nor
repine
since
i
lubbo
past
pardoner
of
the
holy
see
will
now
unloose
assoil
and
remit
them
unto
thee
at
a
price
nodded
beltane
good
my
lord
spake
giles
viewing
the
pardoner
plump
person
with
a
yearning
eye
pray
thee
bid
me
kick
him
hence
not
so
giles
since
from
all
things
may
we
learn
with
patience
here
now
is
one
that
hath
travelled
and
seen
much
and
should
be
wise
forsooth
messire
i
have
been
so
accounted
ere
now
nodded
the
pardoner
dost
hear
giles
thus
from
his
wisdom
i
may
perchance
grow
wiser
than
i
am
so
get
thee
back
to
thy
duty
giles
begone
thy
presence
doth
distract
us
aye
base
archer
begone
nodded
the
pardoner
seating
himself
upon
the
sward
thy
visage
dour
accordeth
not
with
thought
take
it
hence
there
spake
wisdom
giles
and
he
is
a
fool
that
disobeys
so
giles
begone
hereupon
giles
frowned
upon
the
pardoner
who
lolling
at
his
ease
snapped
his
fingers
at
giles
whereat
giles
scowled
amain
and
scowling
strode
away
now
messire
quoth
the
pardoner
opening
his
wallet
now
in
the
matter
of
sinning
messire
an
thou
hast
some
pet
and
peculiar
vice
some
little
pretty
vanity
some
secret
sweet
transgression
nay
first
quoth
beltane
is
sure
thou
hast
a
tongue
o
infallibly
messire
a
sweet
tongue
a
tongue
attuned
to
cunning
phrases
god
gave
to
women
beauty
to
flowers
perfume
and
to
me
a
tongue
good
pardoner
a
lonely
wight
am
i
ignorant
of
the
world
and
of
its
ways
and
doings
so
for
thy
tongue
will
i
barter
base
coin
what
tell
me
for
this
fair
gold
piece
that
fain
would
i
have
the
spending
o
noble
generous
sir
what
more
anything
ye
will
messire
for
since
i
am
the
want
universal
and
gold
the
universal
need
needs
must
want
need
and
here
is
a
phrase
methinks
so
thus
do
i
wed
need
with
want
nodded
beltane
tossing
him
the
coin
come
now
discourse
to
me
of
worldly
things
how
men
do
trim
their
beards
these
days
what
sins
be
most
i
the
fashion
if
duke
ivo
sleepeth
whether
pentavalon
city
standeth
yet
aha
cried
the
pardoner
coin
safely
pouched
i
can
tell
ye
tales
sly
merry
tales
of
lovely
ladies
fair
and
gay
i
can
paint
ye
a
tongue
picture
of
one
beyond
all
fair
ladies
fair
her
soft
white
body
for
kisses
the
lure
of
her
mouth
the
languorous
passion
of
her
eyes
the
glorious
mantle
of
her
hair
i
tell
of
how
she
full
of
witching
wanton
wiles
furtive
fled
from
the
day
and
there
amid
the
soft
and
slumberous
silence
of
the
tender
trees
did
yield
her
love
to
one
beyond
all
beings
blest
thus
sighing
and
did
helen
fair
a
duchess
proud
ah
cried
beltane
clenching
sudden
fist
what
base
and
lying
babble
do
ye
speak
helen
forsooth
dare
ye
name
her
o
thing
now
before
beltane
swift
and
blazing
anger
the
pardoner
assurance
wilted
on
the
instant
and
he
cowered
behind
a
lifted
elbow
nay
nay
most
potent
lord
he
stammered
spit
on
me
an
ye
will
spit
i
do
implore
thee
but
strike
me
not
beseech
thee
sir
in
what
do
i
offend
the
story
runs
that
the
proud
and
wilful
lady
is
fled
away
none
know
wherefore
why
nor
where
i
do
but
read
the
riddle
thus
wherefore
should
she
flee
but
for
love
and
if
for
love
then
with
a
man
and
if
with
a
man
enough
of
her
quoth
beltane
scowling
woman
and
her
wiles
is
of
none
account
to
me
how
how
gasped
the
pardoner
of
no
account
woman
but
youthful
of
no
account
a
man
very
strong
and
lusty
of
no
account
forsooth
o
venus
hear
him
woman
forsooth
she
is
aim
his
beginning
and
his
end
she
is
the
everlasting
cause
she
is
man
sweetest
curse
and
eke
salvation
his
slave
his
very
tyrant
without
woman
strife
would
cease
ambition
languish
venus
pine
to
skin
and
bone
sweet
soul
and
i
never
sell
another
pardon
and
starve
for
lack
of
custom
for
while
women
are
so
will
be
pardoners
but
this
very
week
i
did
good
trade
in
fair
belsaye
with
divers
women
three
were
but
ordinary
indulgences
for
certain
small
marital
transgressions
but
one
a
tender
maid
and
youthful
being
put
to
the
torment
had
denounced
her
father
and
lover
the
torment
quoth
beltane
starting
the
torment
say
you
aye
messire
belsaye
setteth
a
rare
new
fashion
in
torments
of
late
howbeit
the
father
and
lover
being
denounced
before
sir
tribunal
they
were
forthwith
hanged
upon
my
lord
gui
new
gibbets
o
hanged
quoth
beltane
hanged
aye
forsooth
by
the
neck
as
is
the
fashion
now
cometh
this
woeful
wench
to
me
vowing
she
heard
their
voices
i
the
night
and
to
quiet
these
voices
besought
of
me
a
pardon
but
she
had
but
two
sorry
silver
pieces
and
pardons
be
costly
things
and
when
she
could
get
no
pardon
she
went
home
and
that
night
killed
herself
silly

my
lord
good

and
for
lack
of

pitiful
accursed

in
belsaye

and
beltane
cruel
grip
tightened

and
cherish

to
part
with
a

silver
pieces
were
a
grave
folly
so
pray
you
forgive
now
my
ungentleness
and
speak
my
thy
good
sweet
tidings
but
hereupon
the
pardoner
feeling
his
arm
solicitously
held
his
peace
and
glowered
sullenly
at
beltane
who
had
turned
and
was
staring
away
into
the
distance
so
the
pardoner
sulked
awhile
and
spake
not
until
seeing
beltane
hand
creep
out
towards
him
he
forthwith
fell
to
volubility
is
told
in
belsaye
on
right
good
authority
that
a
certain
vile
knave
a
lewd
seditious
rogue
hight
beltane
that
was
aforetime
a
and
thereafter
a
burner
of
gibbets
as
witness
my
lord
duke
tall
great
and
goodly
gallows
that
was
beside
a
prison
breaker
and
known
traitor
hath
been
taken
by
the
doughty
sir
pertolepe
lord
warden
of
the
marches
and
by
him
very
properly
roasted
and
burned
to
death
within
his
great
keep
of
garthlaxton
roasted
forsooth
said
beltane
his
gaze
yet
afar
off
and
forsooth
burned
to
ashes
then
forsooth
is
he
surely
dead
aye
that
is
he
and
his
ashes
scattered
on
a
a
ha
he
was
but
a
knave
is
said
a
rogue
and
a
traitor
now
hereupon
my
lord
the
good
lord
sir
gui
my
lord
lord
seneschal
of
belsaye
forsooth
sighed
beltane
here
be
lords
in
pentavalon
hereupon
the
noble
sir
gui
set
a
close
watch
upon
the
townsfolk
whereby
he
apprehended
divers
suspected
rogues
and
putting
them
to
the
torture
found
thereby
proofs
of
their
vile
sedition
insomuch
that
though
the
women
held
their
peace
for
the
most
part
certain
men
enduring
not
did
confess
knowledge
of
a
subterraneous
passage
the
wall
then
did
sir
gui
cause
this
passage
to
be
stopped
and
four
gibbets
to
be
set
up
within
the
and
thereon
at
sunset
every
day
did
hang
four
men
whereto
the
towns
folk
were
summoned
by
sound
of
tucket
and
drum
until
upon
a
certain
evening
some
six
days
since
myself
standing
by
came
a
white
friar
hight
friar
martin
well
known
in
belsaye
and
bursting
through
the
throng
he
did
proclaim
himself
the
traitor
that
had
oped
and
shown
the
secret
way
into
the
dungeons
unto
that
for
whose
misdeeds
so
many
folk
had
suffered
so
they
took
this
rascal
friar
and
scourged
him
and
set
him
in
the
where
rats
do
frolic
and
at
sunset
he
dieth
by
slow
fire
as
a
warning
to
ah
sweet
noble
good
my
lord
what
what
would
ye
for
beltane
had
risen
and
was
looking
down
at
the
crouching
pardoner
suddenly
haggard
and
with
eyes
with
awful
menace
but
now
the
pardoner
saw
that
those
eyes
looked
through
him
and
beyond
living
eyes
in
a
face
of
death
messire
messire
quavered
the
pardoner
on
trembling
knees
but
beltane
as
one
that
is
deaf
and
blind
strode
forward
and
over
him
and
as
he
went
set
his
bugle
to
his
lips
and
sounded
a
rallying
note
forthwith
came
men
that
ran
towards
him
at
speed
but
now
was
there
no
outcry
or
confusion
and
their
mail
gleamed
in
the
early
sun
as
they
fell
into
their
appointed
rank
and
company
then
beltane
set
his
hands
unto
his
eyes
and
thereafter
stared
up
to
the
heavens
and
round
about
upon
the
fair
earth
as
one
that
wakes
from
a
dream
evil
and
hateful
and
spake
sudden
and
now
hither
to
me
walkyn
giles
and
roger
ye
do
remember
how
upon
a
time
we
met
a
white
friar
in
the
green
that
was
a
son
of
god
they
call
him
brother
martin
ye
do
remember
brave
friar
martin
aye
lord
we
mind
him
quoth
the
three
ye
will
remember
how
that
we
did
within
the
green
aid
him
to
bury
a
dead
maid
young
and
fair
and
tender
yet
done
to
shameful
death
verily
master
a
noble
lady
growled
walkyn
and
very
young
said
roger
and
very
comely
alas
added
giles
so
now
do
i
tell
thee
that
as
she
died
snatched
out
of
life
by
brutal
hands
so
at
this
hour
even
as
we
stand
idle
here
other
maids
do
suffer
and
die
within
belsaye
town
as
we
stand
here
good
friar
martin
lieth
within
the
noisome
where
rats
do
frolic
ha
the
pale
fox
growled
walkyn
bloody
gui
of
allerdale
that
i
do
live
but
to
slay
one
day
with
pertolepe
the
red
thou
dost
remember
roger
how
within
the
keep
at
belsaye
i
sware
an
oath
unto
sir
gui
so
now
this
very
hour
must
we
march
on
belsaye
that
this
my
oath
may
be
kept
but
here
a
murmur
arose
that
hummed
from
rank
to
rank
heads
were
shaken
and
gruff
voices
spake
on
this
wise
belsaye
is
a
long
day
march
to
belsaye
is
a
very
strong
city
very
strongly
guarded
and
we
muster
scarce
two
hundred
the
walls
be
high
and
we
have
no
ladders
or
engines
for
battery
and
storm
forsooth
and
we
have
here
much
booty
already
ha
booty
cried
beltane
there
spake
tall
orson
methinks
aye
cried
another
voice
loud
and
defiant
and
we
be
no
soldiers
master
to
march
walled
cities
foresters
are
we
to
live
secure
and
free
within
the
merry
greenwood
not
so
good
fellows
and
there
spake
jenkyn
o
the
ford
quoth
beltane
stand
forth
orson
and
jenkyn
with
thee
so
now
hearken
again
within
belsaye
men
aye
and
women
too
have
endured
the
torment
orson
at
sundown
a
noble
man
doth
burn
jenkyn
why
master
spake
jenkyn
yet
blenching
from
beltane
unswerving
gaze
good
master
here
is
no
matter
for
honest
woodsmen
aye
nodded
tall
orson
is
no
matter
of
ours
so
wherefore
should
us
meddle
and
ye
have
swords
i
see
quoth
beltane
and
thereto
hands
wherewith
to
fight
yet
do
ye
speak
forsooth
of
booty
and
fain
would
lie
hid
secure
within
the
green
so
be
it
bring
forth
the
record
giles
and
strike
me
out
the
names
of
orson
and
jenkyn
the
which
being
shaped
like
men
are
yet
no
men
give
therefore
unto
each
his
share
of
booty
and
let
him
go
hence
so
saying
beltane
turned
and
looked
upon
the
ranks
that
murmured
and
muttered
no
more
quoth
he
now
and
there
be
any
here
among
us
so
so
unworthy
as
this
orson
and
jenkyn
that
do
hold
treasure
and
safety
above
flesh
and
blood
if
there
be
any
here
who
regarding
his
own
base
body
will
strike
no
blow
for
these
distressed
why
let
him
now
go
forth
of
this
our
company
o
men
o
men
of
pentavalon
do
ye
not
hear
them
these
woeful
ones
do
ye
not
hear
them
crying
to
us
from
searing
flame
from
dungeon
and
gibbet
do
ye
not
hear
is
there
one
that
remembering
the
torments
endured
of
groaning
bodies
the
dire
wrongs
of
innocence
shamed
and
trampled
in
the
mire
lives
there
a
man
that
will
not
adventure
life
and
limb
and
all
he
doth
possess
that
such
things
may
be
smitten
hence
and
made
an
end
of
for
all
time
but
if
such
there
be
let
him
now
stand
forth
with
orson
here
and
jenkyn
o
the
ford
thus
spake
beltane
quick
and
passionate
and
thereafter
paused
waiting
their
answer
but
no
man
spake
or
moved
only
from
their
grim
ranks
a
growl
went
up
ominous
and
deep
and
eyes
grown
bright
and
fierce
glared
upon
tall
orson
and
jenkyn
o
the
ford
who
shuffled
with
their
feet
and
fumbled
with
their
hands
and
knew
not
where
to
look
is
well
is
well
good
comrades
all
spake
beltane
in
a
while
this
night
mayhap
shall
we
each
one
achieve
great
things
go
now
dig
ye
a
pit
and
therein
hide
such
treasure
as
ye
will
and
thereafter
arm
ye
at
points
for
in
the
hour
we
march
eric
see
each
doth
bear
with
him
food
and
giles
look
that
their
quivers
be
full
so
saying
beltane
turned
and
coming
to
his
forthwith
began
to
don
his
armour
and
presently
he
was
aware
of
orson
and
jenkyn
standing
without
the
cave
and
each
with
look
downcast
and
eke
they
fumbled
with
their
hands
and
shuffled
with
their
feet
and
fain
were
to
speak
yet
found
no
word
but
at
last
spake
jenkyn
humbly
and
on
this
wise
master
here
come
i
with
orson
that
is
my
comrade
nay
go
get
thee
to
thy
says
beltane
busied
with
his
armour
nay
but
master
we
be
no
men
quoth
beltane
thus
would
i
be
free
of
ye
both
so
get
you
hence
but
good
master
spake
orson
we
do
ha
changed
our
minds
it
do
be
a
direful
thing
to
burn
and
if
they
do
ha
tormented
maids
is
no
matter
of
thine
quoth
beltane
so
go
thy
ways
and
meddle
not
but
master
now
we
be
stout
men
and
we
be
full
of
lust
to
fight
o
master
let
us
go
kneel
orson
bend
bend
thy
long
shanks
and
forthwith
on
their
knees
fell
jenkyn
and
tall
orson
with
pleading
eyes
and
eager
hands
outstretched
o
master
let
us
go
aye
we
do
ha
changed
our
minds
master
then
be
it
so
said
beltane
and
i
pray
ye
be
ever
faithful
to
your
minds
then
took
they
beltane
hand
to
kiss
and
thereafter
up
they
sprang
and
went
rejoicing
to
their
company
and
within
the
hour
mail
and
bascinet
agleam
the
two
hundred
and
twenty
and
four
marched
forth
of
the
hollow
with
step
blithe
and
free
and
swung
away
through
the
green
till
the
sound
of
voice
and
laughter
the
ring
and
clash
of
their
going
was
died
away
and
none
remained
save
where
upon
the
sward
his
open
wallet
on
his
knee
the
round
and
buxom
pardoner
sat
to
cherish
a
bruised
arm
and
to
stare
from
earth
to
heaven
and
from
heaven
to
earth
with
eyes
wider
and
rounder
even
than
was
their
wont
and
custom
chapter
xxxiv
how
they
came
to
belsaye
through
broad
glades
within
the
wild
by
shady
alleyway
and
leafy
track
they
held
their
march
south
and
by
east
a
close
company
striding
long
and
free
and
waking
the
solitudes
to
a
blithe
babblement
of
laughing
echoes
and
who
among
them
all
so
merry
as
giles
o
the
bow
at
the
head
of
his
sturdy
archers
oft
trolling
some
merry
stave
or
turning
with
some
quip
or
jape
upon
his
tongue
but
with
eyes
quick
to
mark
the
rhythmic
swing
of
broad
shoulders
eyes
critical
yet
eyes
of
pride
who
so
grimly
eager
as
mighty
walkyn
his
heavy
axe
lightly
his
long
legs
schooling
themselves
to
his
comrade
slower
time
and
pace
who
so
utterly
content
as
black
roger
oft
glancing
from
beltane
figure
in
the
van
to
the
files
of
his
their
slung
shields
agleam
their
spears
well
sloped
and
who
so
gloomy
and
thoughtful
as
beltane
unmindful
of
the
youthful
knight
who
went
beside
him
and
scarce
heeding
his
words
until
his
gaze
by
chance
lighted
upon
the
young
knight
armour
that
gleamed
in
the
sun
rich
surcoat
armour
of
the
newest
fashion
of
link
reinforced
by
plates
of
steel
gorget
and
breast
elbow
and
knee
and
with
cunningly
jointed
sollerets
moreover
his
shield
was
small
and
light
according
with
the
new
fashion
and
bare
the
blazon
of
two
hands
tight
clasped
and
the
legend
semper
fidelis
now
viewing
all
this
with
a
smith
knowledgful
eye
quick
to
note
the
costly
excellence
of
this
equipment
beltane
forthwith
brake
silence
how
do
men
name
thee
sir
knight
hereupon
after
some
delay
the
young
knight
made
answer
messire
the
motto
i
bear
upon
my
shield
is
a
good
motto
methinks
so
shalt
call
me
fidelis
an
ye
will
my
lord
so
be
it
sir
faithful
saying
which
beltane
fell
to
deep
thought
again
i
pray
you
my
lord
quoth
fidelis
wherefore
so
sad
so
full
of
gloom
and
thought
i
seek
how
we
may
win
through
the
gates
of
belsaye
sir
fidelis
for
they
go
strongly
guarded
night
and
day
yet
this
day
ere
sunset
ope
to
us
they
must
but
how
how
my
lord
spake
sir
fidelis
i
have
heard
say
that
few
may
go
where
many
may
not
let
first
some
two
or
three
adventure
it
hid
some
close
disguise
a
disguise
cried
beltane
ha
a
disguise
is
well
bethought
good
fidelis
forsooth
a
disguise
and
be
market
day
thereafter
beltane
strode
on
head
bent
in
frowning
thought
nor
spake
again
for
a
space
and
ever
the
files
swung
along
behind
in
time
to
a
marching
song
carolled
blithe
in
the
rich
sweet
voice
of
giles
at
length
beltane
raised
his
head
and
beholding
the
sun
halted
his
company
beside
a
stream
that
flowed
athwart
their
way
and
sitting
thereby
summoned
to
him
the
four
namely
walkyn
and
roger
giles
and
eric
of
the
wry
neck
and
while
they
ate
together
they
held
counsel
on
this
wise
beltane
how
think
ye
of
this
our
adventure
comrades
all
giles
forsooth
as
a
man
do
i
think
well
of
it
ho
for
the
twang
of
bowstrings
the
whirr
and
whistle
of
shafts
loosed
from
the
ear
ha
as
an
archer
and
a
man
is
an
adventure
that
jumpeth
with
my
desire
but
as
a
soldier
and
one
of
much
and
varied
experience
as
one
that
hath
stormed
belsaye
ere
now
with
divers
other
towns
cities
keeps
and
castles
beyond
number
as
a
soldier
i
do
think
it
but
a
gloomy
business
and
foredoomed
to
failure
beltane
and
wherefore
giles
method
tall
brother
method
precise
and
war
is
a
very
ancient
profession
an
honourable
profession
and
therefore
to
be
treated
with
due
reverence
now
without
method
war
would
become
but
a
scurvy
sorry
business
unworthy
your
true
soldier
so
i
a
soldier
loving
my
profession
do
stand
for
method
in
all
things
thus
would
i
attack
a
city
i
do
it
et
forma
first
i
set
up
my
mantelets
for
my
archers
and
under
cover
of
their
swift
shooting
i
set
me
up
my
mangonels
my
trebuchets
and
balistae
then
pushing
me
up
assault
the
walls
with
cat
and
sap
and
having
made
me
a
breach
would
forthwith
take
me
the
place
by
sudden
storm
roger
ha
bowman
here
is
overmuch
of
thee
methinks
and
dost
speak
like
a
very
fool
and
forsooth
a
foolish
archer
to
boot
sure
well
ye
know
that
engines
for
the
battery
have
we
none
giles
verily
so
shall
we
none
of
belsaye
methinks
lacking
engines
we
lack
for
all
no
method
no
city
remember
that
dolt
rogerkin
roger
nay
i
remember
garthlaxton
aflame
the
gallows
aflare
and
the
empty
dungeon
so
an
we
go
up
belsaye
again
shall
we
surely
take
it
remember
these
giles
and
being
a
soldier
be
ye
also
a
man
beltane
what
think
you
walkyn
walkyn
patting
his
axe
of
gui
of
allerdale
master
beltane
and
you
eric
eric
that
where
thou
dost
go
messire
we
follow
beltane
is
well
now
here
beside
me
sitteth
sir
fidelis
who
though
methinks
the
most
youthful
of
us
all
hath
a
head
in
council
wiser
than
us
all
for
he
hath
spoke
me
that
whereby
though
few
in
number
and
lacking
engines
for
battery
giles
we
yet
may
win
through

and

walkyn
we
must
be
far
hence
within
the
hour
forthwith
up
rose
walkyn
and
summoning
divers
of
his
company
strode
away
down
stream
what
time
giles
staring
after
him
in
wonderment
thereafter
shook
his
head
at
roger
quoth
he
tall
brother
and
lord
now
do
i
see
that
our
roger
burneth
for
knowledge
panteth
for
understanding
and
fain
would
question
thee
but
that
his
mouth
is
of
meat
yet
do
his
bulging
eyes
supplicate
the
wherefore
of
smocks
and
his
goodly
large
ears
do
twitch
for
the
why
of
sacks
o

rogerkin
bolt

or
a
sack
for

is
no
question
of
wherefore
or
why
so
long
as
he
doth
get
them
but
the
straw
roger
said
giles
glancing
askew
at
beltane
an
thou
plague
my
lord
with
questions
how
think
ye
then
he
shall
answer
of
this
straw
thus
thou
crafty
giles
answered
beltane
belsaye
is
strong
but
strength
may
be
perchance
beguiled
so
may
a
miller
smock
hide
a
shirt
of
mail
and
straw
i
have
heard
will
burn
oho
a
wile
cried
giles
aha
some
notable
wile
what
more
more
shalt
thou
know
mayhap
in
belsaye
and
when
beltane
had
handled
the
smocks
had
viewed
the
bulging
that
walkyn
and
his
fellows
brought
him
he
arose
at
his
word
the
company
fell
to
their
ranks
and
forthwith
swung
off
again
south
and
by
east
what
time
giles
carolled
blithely
and
divers
chorused
lustily
while
roger
whistled
and
even
grim
walkyn
bethinking
him
of
gui
of
allerdale
rumbled
hoarsely
in
his
hairy
throat
so
the
miles
passed
unheeded
until
as
the
sun
declined
they
left
the
wild
country
behind
wherefore
beltane
commanded
all
men
to
a
strict
silence
and
thus
came
they
betimes
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
halting
within
the
green
beheld
afar
across
the
plain
the
walls
of
fair
belsaye
town
we
are
well
to
time
quoth
beltane
glancing
from
sinking
sun
to
lengthening
shadow
we
have
yet
an
hour
to
sunset
but
in
this
hour
much
have
we
to
do
hark
ye
now
and
drawing
the
four
about
him
he
spake
them
thus
walkyn
and
roger
and
eric
shall
into
the
town
with
me
in
miller
guise
each
bearing
his
sack
of
flour
what
time
you
giles
with
sir
fidelis
and
all
our
power
bide
here
well
hid
till
such
time
as
ye
shall
see
a
smoke
within
belsaye
and
when
ye
see
this
smoke
rise
up
and
make
you
ready
one
and
all
yet
stir
not
from
the
green
till
that
ye
hear
my
sound
our
then
come
ye
on
amain
and
being
within
the
city
charge
ye
where
my
horn
shall
sound
how
now
agreed
aye
lord
nodded
giles
is
an
excellent
strategy
in
faith
and
yet
wiser
methinks
to
suffer
me
in
roger
place
for
being
guileful
in
war
so
should
i
be
a
very
beguiling
miller
whereas
roger
an
we
plastered
him
with
flour
would
be
other
than
rogerkin
the
black
nay
giles
thy
post
is
here
let
your
bows
be
strung
and
ready
but
set
your
pikes
to
the
fore
and
giles
watch
walkyn
bring
now
the
smocks
so
saying
beltane
tightened
his
belt
drew
on
his
hood
of
mail
and
laced
it
close
and
turning
found
sir
fidelis
close
by
to
aid
him
with
the
hooded
smock
and
beltane
wondered
to
see
him
so
pale
and
his
slender
hands
so
the
smocks
were
donned
with
straw
about
their
legs
bound
by
withies
as
was
the
custom
and
taking
the
sacks
upon
their
shoulders
they
turned
aside
into
the
green
and
were
gone

how
gui
of
allerdale
ceased
from
evil
sir
gui
of
allerdale
lord
seneschal
of
belsaye
town
rode
hawk
on
fist
at
the
head
of
divers
noble
knights
and
gentle
esquires
with
verderers
and
falconers
attendant
the
dusty
highway
that
led
across
the
plain
to
the
frowning
gates
of
belsaye
was
with
country
folk
trudging
on
foot
or
seated
in
heavy
carts
whose
clumsy
wheels
creaked
and
groaned
for
though
the
sun
was
far
declined
it
was
moreover
a
man
was
to
die
by
the
fire
and
though
such
sights
were
yet
was
seldom
that
any
lord
seneschal
warden
castellan
or
in
fine
any
potent
lord
dowered
with
right
of
pit
and
gallows
dared
lay
hand
upon
a
son
of
the
church
even
of
the
lesser
and
poorer
orders
but
sir
gui
was
a
bold
man
and
greatly
daring
wherefore
it
was
that
though
the
was
well
nigh
done
the
road
was
yet
with
folk
all
eager
to
behold
and
watch
how
a
white
friar
could
face
death
by
the
flame
so
on
horse
and
afoot
in
creaking
cart
and
wain
they
thronged
toward
the
goodly
city
of
belsaye
sir
gui
rode
at
a
and
as
he
rode
the
folk
drew
hastily
aside
to
give
him
way
and
bent
the
knee
full
humbly
or
stood
with
bowed
heads
uncovered
to
watch
him
pass
but
bristling
brows
full
many
an
eye
glared
fiercely
on
his
slender
figure
marking
his
quick
dark
glance
the
nose
of
him
with
the
thin
lips
and
the
long
pointed
chin
below
thus
rode
he
assured
in
his
might
and
confident
heedless
alike
of
the
glory
of
day
fast
drawing
into
evening
of
the
green
world
whose
every
blade
and
leaf
spake
of
life
abundant
and
of
these
trampling
folk
who
bent
so
humbly
at
his
passing
their
cheeks
aglow
with
health
thus
heeding
but
himself
and
his
own
most
dear
desires
how
should
he
mark
the
four
tall
and
dusty
miller
men
whose
brawny
backs
were
stooped
each
beneath
its
burden
and
how
should
he
confident
in
his
strength
and
might
hale
and
lusty
in
his
body
come
to
think
on
death
sharp
and
swift
thus
sir
gui
of
allerdale
lord
seneschal
of
belsaye
town
rode
upon
his
way
with
eyes
that
glowed
with
the
love
of
life
and
tongue
that
curled
smiling
lips
as
one
that
savoured
its
sweetness
or
meditated
coming
joys
perceiving
the
which
two
youthful
esquires
that
rode
near
by
nudged
elbows
and
set
their
heads
together
i
know
yon
look
aha
is
the
goldsmith
fair

there

and

they
say
but
pan
was
coy
and
jove
hist
he
beckons
us
so
came
these
young
esquires
beside
sir
gui
who
tapping
the
dust
from
his
habit
with
soft
white
hand
spake
and
sweet
ride
on
sirs
and
bid
our
careful
warden
stay
awhile
the
execution
of
this
traitorous
friar
let
the
square
be
lined
with
pikes
as
is
our
custom
let
the
prisoner
be
chained
unto
his
stake
see
you
but
let
all
things
stay
until
i
be
come
there
will
be
many
folk
in
belsaye
meseemeth
well
let
them
wait
and
stare
and
whisper
and
wait
till
i
be
come
forward
spurred
the
young
esquires
to
do
as
was
commanded
joyful
to
see
the
confusion
that
marked
their
swift
career
and
making
good
play
of
their
whips
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
such
as
chanced
to
be
within
reach
in
especial
upon
a
mighty
fellow
in
floured
smock
that
bare
a
sack
on
his
shoulder
and
who
stung
with
the
blow
cried
a
curse
on
them
in
voice
so
harsh
and
bold
that
folk
shrank
from
his
neighbourhood
yet
marvelled
at
his
daring
being
come
anon
within
the
city
sir
gui
dismounted
beside
the
gate
and
giving
horse
and
falcon
to
an
esquire
beckoned
to
him
a
grizzled
now
as
he
did
so
a
tall
miller
passed
him
by
and
stumbling
wearily
set
down
his
sack
against
the
wall
and
panted
bare
you
the
letter
as
i
commanded
rolf
aye
my
lord
what
said
she
wept
my
lord
spake
she
nought
nought
my
lord
lieth
the
goldsmith
deep
above
the
my
lord
and
she
wept
say
you
methinks
the
goldsmith
shall
go
free
so
saying
sir
gui
went
on
into
the
city
and
as
he
went
his
smile
was
back
again
and
his
tongue
curved
red
betwixt
his
lips
and
presently
the
tall
miller
hoisted
his
burden
and
went
on
into
the
city
also
turned
aside
down
a
narrow
passage
betwixt
gloomy
houses
and
so
at
last
out
into
the
square
that
hummed
with
a
clamour
hushed
and
expectant
but
my
lord
seneschal
unheeding
ever
came
unto
a
certain
quiet
corner
of
the
square
remote
and
shady
being
far
removed
from
the
stir
and
bustle
of
the
place
here
he
paused
at
an
open
doorway
and
turned
to
look
back
into
the
square
ruddy
with
sunset
a
careless
glance
that
saw
the
blue
of
sky
the
houses
bathed
in
the
warm
sunset
glow
the
which
falling
athwart
the
square
shone
red
upon
the
smock
of
a
miller
who
stooping
his
burden
stumbled
across
the
uneven
hard
by
all
this
saw
sir
gui
in
that
one
backward
glance
then
unheeding
as
ever
went
in
at
the
doorway
and
up
the
dark
and
narrow
stair
but
now
it
chanced
that
the
miller
coming
also
to
this
door
stood
a
while
sack
on
shoulder
peering
up
into
the
gloom
within
thereafter
having
set
down
his
burden
in
stealthy
fashion
he
also
turned
and
glanced
back
with
eyes
that
glittered
in
the
shadow
of
his
hat
then
setting
one
hand
within
his
smock
he
went
in
at
the
door
and
began
to
creep
up
that
dark
and
narrow
stair
she
sat
in
a
great
carven
chair
her
arms
outstretched
across
the
table
before
her
her
face
bowed
low
between
and
the
setting
sun
made
a
glory
of
her
golden
hair
of
a
sudden
she
started
and
lifting
her
head
looked
upon
sir
gui
her
tears
and
bitter
staining
the
beauty
of
her
face
my
lord
ah
no
she
panted
and
started
to
her
feet
dear
and
fair
my
lady
fear
not
strong
am
i
but
very
gentle
is
ever
my
way
with
beauty
i
do
but
come
for
my
answer
and
he
pointed
to
a
crumpled
parchment
that
lay
upon
the
table
o
good
my
lord
she
whispered
i
can
not
if
thou
art
gentle
indeed
then
he
lieth
above
the
lady
sighed
sir
gui
ah
the
sweet
christ
aid
me
he
goeth
to
death
or
lieth
in
those
round
white
arms
lady
the
choice
is
thine
and
i
pray
you
show
pity
to
thy
husband
who
loveth
thee
well
is
said
now
hereupon
she
sobbed
amain
and
fell
upon
her
knees
with
arms
outstretched
in
passionate
appeal
but
lo
she
spake
no
word
her
swimming
eyes
oped
suddenly
wide
and
with
arms
yet
outstretched
she
stared
and
stared
beyond
sir
gui
in
so
much
that
he
turned
and
started
back
amazed
to
behold
one
clad
as
a
dusty
miller
a
mighty
man
whose
battered
hat
touched
the
lintel
and
whose
great
bulk
filled
the
doorway
a
very
silent
man
who
looked
and
looked
with
neck
yet
moved
not
and
uttered
no
word
hereupon
sir
gui
spake
quick
and
fool
fool
hence
thou
blundering
fool
for
this
shalt
be
flayed
alive
ha
hence
thou
dusty
rogue
but
now
this
grim
figure
stirred
and
lifting
a
great
hand
spake
hoarse
and
low
peace
knight
hold
thy
peace
and
look
the
hat
was
tossed
to
the
floor
and
sir
gui
clenching
his
hands
would
have
spoken
but
the
harsh
voice
drowned
his
words
how
knight
thou
that
art
bloody

dost
thou
not
know
me
forsooth
i

then
sir
gui
stepped
back
drawing
his
sword
but
even
so
death
leapt
at
him
a
woman
wailing
fled
from
the
chamber
a
chair
crashed
to
the
floor
came
a
strange
quick
tapping
of
feet
upon
the
floor
and
thereafter
rose
a
cry
that
swelled
louder
to
a
scream
louder
to
a
bubbling
shriek
and
dying
to
a
groaning
hiss
was
gone
and
in
a
while
walkyn
that
had
been
waldron
of
brand
rose
up
from
his
knees
and
running
forth
of
the
chamber
hasted
down
the
dark
and
narrow
stair

how
the
folk
of
belsaye
town
made
them
an
end
of
tyranny
the
was
full
of
the
stir
and
hum
of
jostling
crowds
here
were
townsfolk
men
and
women
and
children
who
cowed
by
suffering
and
bitter
wrong
spake
little
and
that
little
below
their
breath
here
were
country
folk
from
village
and
farmstead
near
and
far
a
motley
company
that
talked
amain
and
eager
as
they
pushed
and
strove
to
see
where
in
the
midst
of
the
square
beyond
the
serried
ranks
of
a
post
had
been
set
up
a
massy
post
grim
and
solitary
whose
heavy
chains
and
iron
girdle
gleamed
ominous
and
red
in
the
last
rays
of
sunset
near
by
upon
a
dais
they
had
set
up
a
chair
fairly
gilded
wherein
sir
gui
was
wont
to
sit
and
watch
justice
done
upon
the
writhing
bodies
of
my
lord
duke
enemies
indeed
the
citizens
of
belsaye
had
beheld
sights
many
and
dire
of
late
wherefore
now
they
blenched
before
this
stark
and
grisly
thing
and
looked
askance
but
to
these
country
folk
such
things
were
something
newer
wherefore
they
pushed
and
strove
amid
the
press
that
they
might
view
it
nearer
in
especial
two
in
miller
hooded
smocks
tall
and
lusty
fellows
these
who
by
dint
of
shoulder
and
elbow
won
forward
until
they
were
stayed
by
the
file
of
sir

thereupon
spake
one
close
in
his
fellow
ear
where
tarries
walkyn

said
beltane
below
his

master
i

he
vanished
in

now

strike

and

the

i
here
amid

take
up
the

and
in
the
rush
join
with

at

patience
roger
and
now
of
a
sudden
the
throng
stirred
swayed
and
was
still
but
from
many
a
quivering
lip
a
breath
went
up
to
heaven
a
sigh
a
whispered
groan
as
through
the
shrinking
populace
the
prisoner
was
brought
a
man
of
belsaye
he
a
man
strong
and
tender
whom
many
had
loved
full
well
half
borne
half
dragged
betwixt
his
gaolers
he
came
on
stumbling
feet
a
woeful
shivering
thing
with
languid
head
a
thing
of
noisome
rags
that
told
of
nights
and
days
in
dungeon
black
and
foul
a
thing
whose
shrunken
nakedness
showed
a
multitude
of
small
wounds
that
spoke
of
teeth
little
yet
vicious
bold
with
hunger
in
the
dark
a
miserable
tottering
thing
haggard
and
pinched
that
shivered
and
shook
and
stared
upon
all
things
with
eyes
vacant
and
wide
and
thus
it
was
that
beltane
beheld
again
friar
martin
the
white
friar
that
had
been
a
man
once
a
strong
man
and
a
gentle
they
brought
him
to
the
great
post
they
clasped
him
fast
within
the
iron
band
and
so
left
him
shivering
in
his
chains
with
head
came
the
sound
of
muffled
weeping
from
the
crowd
while
high
above
in
sky
deepening
to
evening
a
star
twinkled
now
in
a
while
the
white
friar
raised
his
heavy
head
and
looked
round
about
and
lo
his
eyes
were
vacant
no
longer
and
as
folk
strove
to
come
more
nigh
he
spake
and
feeble
o
children
grieve
not
for
me
for
though
this
body
suffer
a
little
my
soul
doth
sit
serene
what
though
i
stand
in
bonds
yet
doth
my
soul
go
free
though
they
burn
my
flesh
to
ashes
yet
doth
my
soul
live
on
forever
so
grieve
not
your
hearts
for
me
my
children
and
for
yourselves
though
ye
be
afflicted
even
as
i
fear
ye
nothing
since
i
that
ye
all
do
know
for
a
truthful
man
do
tell
ye
is
none
so
hard
to
die
if
that
our
hearts
be
clean
what
though
ye
suffer
the
grievous
horror
of
a
prison
within
the
dark
ye
shall
find
god
thus
i
amid
the
dreadful
gloom
of
my
deep
dungeon
did
lie
within
the
arms
of
god
nothing
fearing
so
when
the
fire
shall
sear
me
though
this
my
flesh
may
groan
god
shall
reach
down
to
me
through
smoke
and
flame
and
lift
my
soul
beyond
o
be
ye
therefore
comforted
my
children
though
each
must
die
yet
to
the
pure
in
heart
death
is
none
so
hard
thus
spake
friar
martin
shivering
in
his
bonds
what
time
the
crowd
rocked
and
swayed
sobbing
aloud
and
groaning
whereat
sir
pikemen
made
lusty
play
with
their
then
spake
beltane
whispering
to
roger
who
sweating
with
impatience
groaned
and
stared
and
gnawed
upon
his
fingers
away
roger
and
on
the
instant
roger
had
turned
and
with
brawny
shoulders
stooped
drove
through
the
swaying
press
and
was
gone
now
with
every
moment
the
temper
of
the
crowd
grew
more
threatening
voices
shouted
fists
were
clenched
and
the
scowling
plying
vicious
cursed
and
questioned
each
other
aloud
why
tarries
sir
gui
hereupon
a
country
fellow
hard
by
took
up
the
question
sir
gui
he
shouted
why
cometh
not
sir
gui
aye
cried
others
where
tarries
sir
gui
why
doth
he
keep
us
where
tarries
sir
gui
here
roared
a
voice
deep
and
harsh
way
make
way
and
suddenly
high
above
the
swaying
crowd
rose
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
a
mighty
man
in
the
dusty
habit
of
a
miller
upon
whose
hood
and
smock
were
great
gouts
and
stains
evil
and
dark
and
now
beholding
what
manner
of
stains
these
were
all
men
fell
silent
and
blenched
from
his
path
thus
amid
a
lane
of
pallid
faces
that
stared
and
shrank
away
the
tall
miller
came
unto
the
wondering
burst
their
ranks
and
leapt
upon
the
dais
where
stood
the
gilded
chair
ho
soldiers
and
good
people
of
belsaye
call
ye
for
gui
in
sooth
hunger
ye
for
sight
of
bloody
gui
of
allerdale
in
faith
why
then
behold
and
from
under
his
smock
he
drew
forth
a
head
pale
as
to
cheek
and
hair
whose
wide
eyes
stared
blindly
as
it
dangled
in
his
hairy
hand
and
now
staring
up
at
this
awful
sightless
thing
that
brow
at
whose
frown
a
city
had
trembled
those
pallid
lips
that
had
smiled
and
smiling
doomed
men
and
women
to
torment
and
death
a
hush
fell
on
belsaye
and
no
man
spoke
or
stirred
then
while
all
folk
stood
thus
rigid
and
at
gaze
a
wild
cry
was
heard
shivering
the
stillness
and
smiting
all
hearts
with
sudden
dread
fire
fire
aye
fire
roared
the
miller
see
yonder
and
he
pointed
where
a
column
of
thick
smoke
mounted
slowly
upon
the
windless
air
but
with
the
cry
came
tumult
a
hurry
of
feet
shouts
and
yells
and
hoarse
commands
armour
clashed
and
glittered
for
the
charge
then
walkyn
laughed
and
hurling
the
pale
head
down
at
the
nearest
soldiery
drew
from
his
smock
his
mighty
axe
and
swung
it
but
lo
him
and
the
was
a
surging
ravening
mob
that
closed
front
and
rear
upon
knight
and
squire
upon
and
men
who
leapt
to
grip
mailed
throats
in
naked
hands
women
who
screamed
and
tore
and
one
by
one
knight
and
squire
and
smiting
shrieking
groaning
were
dragged
down
with
merciless
hands
to
be
wrenched
at
torn
and
trampled
merciless
feet
while
high
and
clear
above
this
fierce
and
dreadful
clamour
rose
the
shrill
summons
of
a
horn
and
lo
a
shout
a
roar
drowning
the
shrieks
of
dying
men
the
screams
of
vengeful
women
arise
arise
pentavalon
came
a
rush
of
feet
a
shock
and
thereafter
a
confused
din
that
rose
and
fell
and
gradually
ceasing
was
lost
in
a
sudden
clamour
of
bells
in
wild
and
joyous
riot
aha

stooping
to

o

ever
from
the
tearing
hands
of
vengeful
mothers
and
women
wronged
and
turning
his
back
on
the
littered
market
square
giles
shivered
and
leaned
him
upon
his
sword
as
one
that
is
sick
nay

being

there

my
lord
horn
and
is
the
come
away
giles
side
by
side
they
went
oft
stepping
across
some
shapeless
horror
until
in
their
going
they
chanced
on
one
that
knelt
above
a
child
small
and
dead
and
beholding
the
costly
fashion
of
this
man
armour
roger
stooped
and
wondering
touched
his
bowed
shoulder
sir
fidelis
said
he
good
young
messire
and
art
thou
hurt
forsooth
hurt
sighed
sir
fidelis
staring
up
hurt
nay
behold
this
sweet
babe
ah
gentle
christ
so
innocent
and
slain
a
tender
babe
and
yonder
yonder
what
dire
sights
lie
yonder
and
sighing
the
youthful
knight
sank
back
across
black
roger
arm
and
so
lay
speechless
and
quoth
roger
what
giles
here
one
that
loveth
woman
no
more
than
thou
thus
saying
he
stooped
and
lifting
the
young
knight
in
his
arms
bore
him
across
the
square
stumbling
now
and
then
on
things
in
the
dark
for
night
was
at
hand
so
thus
it
was
that
the
folk
of
fair
belsaye
town
men
and
women
with
gnashing
teeth
and
rending
hands
made
them
an
end
of
tyranny
until
with
the
night
there
nothing
remained
of
proud
sir
gui
and
all
his
lusty
garrison
save
shapeless
blotches
piled
amid
the
gloom
and
that
which
lay
forgotten
quite
a
cold
and
pallid
thing
befouled
with
red
and
trampled
mire
a
thing
of
no
account
henceforth
that
stared
up
with
glazed
and
sightless
eyes
where
remote
within
the
sombre
firmament
of
heaven
a
great
star
glowed
and
trembled
chapter
xxxvii
how
they
left
belsaye
lanthorns
gleamed
and
torches
flared
in
the
great
square
of
belsaye
where
panting
shouting
townsfolk
thronged
upon
beltane
and
his
company
with
tears
of
joy
with
laughter
loud
and
with
shouts
and
wild
acclaim
many
there
were
who
knelt
to
kiss
their
hands
their
feet
the
very
links
of
their
armour
and
presently
came
giles
o
the
bow
debonair
and
smiling
a
woman
scarf
about
his
brawny
throat
a
dozen
ribands
and
favours
tied
about
each
mailed
arm
lord
quoth
he
tall
brother
i
have
been
fairly
kissed
by
full
a
score
of
buxom
dames
the
which
is
excellent
good
for
the
women
of
belsaye
are
of
beauty
renowned
but
to
kiss
is
a
rare
and
notable
science
and
to
kiss
well
a
man
should
eat
well
and
forsooth
empty
am
i
as
any
drum
therefore
prithee
let
us
eat
that
i
may
uphold
my
reputation
for
as
the
learned
master
ovidius
hath
it
but
from
the
townsfolk
a
shout
arose
comes
the
reeve
is
good
master
cuthbert
way
for
the
reeve
hereupon
the
crowd
parting
a
tall
man
appeared
his
goodly
apparel
torn
his
long
white
hair
disordered
while
in
his
hand
he
yet
grasped
a
naked
sword
stern
his
face
was
and
lined
beyond
his
years
moreover
his
broad
shoulders
were
bowed
with
more
than
age
but
his
eye
was
bright
and
quick
and
when
he
spake
his
voice
was
strong
and
full
which
i
pray
is
chiefest
among
ye
that
am
i
quoth
beltane
messire
said
the
reeve
who
and
what
men
ye
are
i
know
not
but
in
the
name
of
these
my
do
i
thank
ye
for
our
deliverance
but
words
be
poor
things
now
therefore
an
it
be
treasure
ye
do
seek
ye
shall
be
satisfied
we
have
suffered
much
by
extortion
but
if
gold
be
your
desire
then
whatsoever
gold
doth
lie
in
our
treasury
the
half
of
it
is
freely
thine
o
most
excellent
reeve
cried
giles
forsooth
a
very
proper
spirit
of
gratitude
good
master
spake
beltane
quelling
the
archer
with
a
look
these
my
comrades
hither
came
that
a
noble
man
should
not
perish
and
that
sir
gui
of
allerdale
should
cease
from
evil
and
behold
is
done
so
i
pray
you
give
us
food
and
shelter
for
the
night
for
with
the
dawn
we
march
hence
but
o
tall
brother
gasped
giles
o
sweet
lord
there
was
mention
made
of
treasure
a
reeve
a
reeve
with
bowels
quoth
he
and
likewise
and
these
be
matters
to
excogitate
upon
moreover
obediunt
brother
money
forsooth
quoth
beltane
bitterly
now
out
upon
thee
giles
how
think
ye
money
shall
avail
the
like
of
us
whose
lives
are
forfeit
each
and
every
whose
foes
be
many
and
strong
who
must
ever
be
on
our
ward
quick
to
smite
lest
we
be
smitten
money
forsooth
so
good
master
reeve
keep
thy
useless
treasure
and
in
its
stead
give
to
us
good
steel
broadswords
sharp
and
and
stout
give
of
these
to
such
as
lack
but
o
brother
says
giles
with
gold
may
we
gain
all
these
verily
giles
but
gaining
all
without
gold
we
lack
not
for
gold
nor
have
the
added
fear
of
losing
it
he
that
would
gain
wealth
must
first
win
freedom
for
without
freedom
the
richest
is
but
a
sorry
slave
so
give
us
steel
good
master
reeve
now
from
giles
archers
and
divers
others
beside
a
growl
went
up
spreading
from
rank
to
rank
what
time
beltane
clenched
his
hands
frowning
ever
blacker
then
forth
stepped
jenkyn
o
the
ford
with
tall
orson
which
last
spake
with
voice
uplift
master
quoth
he
us
do
love
gold
but
fighting
men
us
do
be
and
if
says
you
says
we
aye
nodded
jenkyn
so
master
here
stands
i
wi
orson
my
comrade
for
witness
that
we
be
better
men
than
these
growlers
but
here
of
a
sudden
rose
the
shrill
bray
of
a
trumpet
without
the
walls
a
long
flourish
loud
and
imperious
and
at
the
sound
a
silence
fell
wherein
divers
of
the
townsfolk
eyed
each
other
in
fear
and
drew
nearer
to
the
reeve
who
stood
leaning
heavily
upon
his
sword
his
head
stooped
upon
his
broad
chest
and
in
the
silence
giles
spake
now
by
the
saint

the
summons
of

mouth
even
as
they
watched

but
now
while
the
reeve
yet
stood
pale
in
the
torchlight
finding
nought
to

came
beltane
beside
him
my
lord
quoth
he

mock

knave
cried
sir
robert
and
clenching
iron
hand
he
spurred
upon
beltane
but
checked
as
suddenly
and
pointed
where
midst
the
shrinking
populace
strode
one
in
knightly
armour
whose
embroidered
surcoat
bore
the
arms
and
whose
vizored
helm
the
crest
of
sir
gui
of
allerdale
now
beholding
this
silent
figure
a
groan
of
fear
went
up
divers
men
sank
crouching
on
their
knees
the
reeve
uttered
a
hoarse
gasp
and
covered
his
face
while
even
beltane
staring
felt
his
flesh
but
now
sir
robert
rode
forward
greeting
lord
seneschal
said
he
you
come
betimes
messire
though
not
over
hastily
methinks
forsooth
quoth
the
figure
his
voice
booming
in
his
great
forsooth
and
verily
there
be
three
things

man
should
leave
in
haste
and

prayers
his
dinner

his
lady

knave

arrant
knave
with
long
legs
he
will
look
well

gallows
as
well
as

the
rogue

devilish
arts
sacked
and
burned

as
thus

there
hath
come
unto
the
duke
one
hight
gurth
a
rogue
that

of
this
vile
outlaw
and
at
sunset
sir
pertolepe
and
i
with
goodly
force
march
into
the
green
so
now

i
hence
leaving
with
thee
these
captives
from
bourne
that
you
shall
hang
above
the
walls
for
a
warning
to
all
such
outlaws
and
traitors
lastly
my
lord
seneschal
drink
not
so
deep
and
so
fare
thee
well
now
as
he
yet
spake
rose
the
shrill
notes
of
a
horn
and
turning
about
sir
robert
beheld
men
whose
mail
glistened
in
the
torchlight
and
whose
long
pikes
hemmed
him
in
close
and
closer
what
time
a
fierce
shout
went
up
kill
kill
ho
treason
he
roared
and
grasped
at
his
sword
hilt
but
down
came
roger
heavy
broadsword
upon
sir
robert
helm
beating
him
to
earth
where
walkyn
mighty
foot
crushed
him
down
and
his
axe
gleamed
bright
then
while
the
air
rang
with
shouts
and
cries
and
the
clatter
of
trampling
hoofs
a
white
figure
leapt
and
bestrode
the
fallen
knight
and
walkyn
glared
down
into
the
pale
face
of
friar
martin
forbear
walkyn
forbear
he
cried
and
speaking
staggered
for
very
weakness
and
would
have
fallen
but
walkyn
long
arm
was
about
him
and
ever
the
uproar
grew
the
grim
ranks
of
archers
and
pikemen
drew
closer
about
sir
robert
shrinking
what
time
the
townsfolk
brandishing
their
weapons
shouted
amain
kill
kill
now
roger
blow
had
been
full
lusty
and
sir
robert
yet
lay
seeing
which
divers
of
his
company
casting
down
their
arms
cried
aloud
for
quarter
whereat
the
townsfolk
shouted
but
the
fiercer
slay
them
kill
kill
but
now
high
above
this
clamour
rose
the
shrill
note
of
beltane
horn
bidding
all
men
to
silence
hereupon
there
came
to
him
the
white
friar
who
looking
earnestly
upon
his
mailed
face
uttered
a
sudden
glad
cry
and
caught
his
hand
and
kissed
it
then
turned
he
to
the
surging
concourse
and
spake
loud
and
joyously
stay
good
people
of
belsaye
o
ye
children
of
affliction
spill
not
the
blood
of
these
thine
enemies
but
look
rather
upon
this
man
for
this
is
he
of
whom
i
told
ye
in
the
days
of
your
tribulation
this
is
he
who
burned
the
shameful
gallows
who
brake
open
the
dungeon
and
hath
vowed
his
life
to
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
and
weak
behold
now
the
son
of
beltane
the
strong
and
just
behold
beltane
our
rightful
duke
now
went
there
up
to
heaven
a
great
and
wild
acclaim
shouts
of
joy
and
the
thunderous
arise
arise
pentavalon
then
while
all
eyes
beheld
and
all
ears
hearkened
beltane
spake
him
plain
and
to
the
point
as
was
his
custom
behold
now
men
of
belsaye
these
our
enemies
do
cry
us
mercy
and
shall
we
not
bestow
it
moreover
one
living
hostage
is
better
than
two
foemen
slain
entreat
them
gently
therefore
but
let
me
see
them
lodged
secure
ere
i
march
hence
but
hereupon
came
many
of
the
townsfolk
with
divers
counsellors
and
chief
men
of
the
city
who
kneeling
most
earnestly
prayed
beltane
to
abide
for
their
defence
good
my
lord
quoth
the
reeve
bethink
thee
when
duke
ivo
shall
hear
of
our
doings
he
will
seek
bitter
vengeance
ah
my
lord
was
but
five
years
agone
he
stormed
belsaye
and
gave
it
up
to
pillage
and
on
that
day
my
wife
was
slain
and
when
he
had
set
up
his
great
gallows
and
hanged
it
full
with
our
men
he
vowed
that
should
belsaye
anger
him
again
he
would
burn
the
city
and
all
within
it
and
o
my
lord
my
lord
i
have
yet
a
daughter
ah
good
my
lord
leave
us
not
to
ravishment
and
death
aye
go
not
from
us
my
lord
cried
the
others
be
thou
our
leader
henceforth
and
thereto
they
besought
him
with
eager
cries
and
with
hands
outstretched
but
beltane
shook
his
head
quoth
he
look
now
as
men
are
born
into
the
world
but
for
the
good
of
man
so
must
i
to
my
duty
and
methinks
this
is
my
duty
to
do
such
deeds
as
shall
ring
throughout
this
sorrowful
duchy
like
a
bidding
all
men
arise
and
take
hold
upon
their
manhood
garthlaxton
is
no
more
but
there
be
many
castles
yet
to
burn
whose
flames
perchance
shall
light
such
a
fire
within
the
souls
of
men
as
shall
be
quenched
until
wrong
and
tyranny
be
done
away
so
must
i
back
to
the
to
wild
and
desperate
doings
but
as
for
ye
i
have
heard
tell
that
the
men
of
belsaye
are
brave
and
resolute
let
now
the
memory
of
wrongs
endured
make
ye
trebly
valiant
to
maintain
your
liberty
if
duke
ivo
come
then
let
your
walls
be
manned
for
is
better
to
die
free
men
than
trust
again
to
his
mercy
verily
lord
said
the
reeve
but
we
do
lack
for
leaders
our
provost
and
all
our
captains
duke
ivo
hanged
upon
his
gallows
beseech
thee
then
give
to
us
a
leader
cunning
in
war
that
will
i
answered
beltane
on
this
condition
that
every
able
man
shall
muster
under
arms
each
day
within
the
it
shall
be
done
my
lord
then
summoned
he
eric

the
wry
neck
together
with
giles
who
came
forthwith

yet
bedight
in
sir

my
lord

in
other
days
i
was
the
duke
thy
father
high
constable
of
all
the
towns

so
in
sooth
then
now

i
make

of
belsaye
as
to
thee
giles
thou
guileful
rogue
hast
full
oft
vaunted
thyself
a
soldier
of
experience
so
now
am
i
minded
to
prove
thee
and
thy
methods
how
if
i
give
thee
charge
over
the
bowmen
of
belsaye
why
first
sweet
tall
brother
first
will
i
teach
them
to
draw
a
bow
pluck
a
string
and
speed
a
shaft
as
never
townsman
drew
plucked
or
sped
in
fine
i
will
teach
them
to
shoot
and
thereafter
devoutly
pray
the
good
saint
giles
that
is
my
patron
saint
to
send
us
black
ivo
and
his
dogs
to
shoot
at
so
be
it
choose
ye
now
each
ten
men
of
your
companies
that
shall
abide
here
with
ye

time

am
away

in
your
hands

sword
and
swear
me
to
maintain
belsaye
to
the
last
man
siege
or
storm
so
long
as
life
be
in
you
now
when
they
had
sworn
beltane
turned
him
to
the
reeve
good
sir
quoth
he
i
pray
you
loose
now
the
captives
from
their
chains
let
your
prisoners
be
secured
and
for
the
rest
let
us
now
eat
and
drink
lest
we
famish
thus
in
a
while
sir
robert
of
hurstmanswyke
dazed
and
bewildered
and
his
four
esquires
together
with
his
thirty
stripped
of
armour
and
weapons
were
led
away
and
lodged
secure
beneath
the
keep
now
it
chanced
that
as
beltane
stood
apart
with
head
as
one
in
thought
there
came
to
him
sir
fidelis
and
touched
him
with
gentle
hand
my
lord
beltane
said
he
softly
of
what
think
you
of
pentavalon
and
how
soonest
her
sorrows
may
be
done
away
lovest
thou
pentavalon
indeed
messire
aye
truly
fidelis
then
wherefore
let
her
suffer
longer
suffer
aye
there
it
is
but
how
may
i
bring
her
woes
to
sudden
end
i
am
too
weak
her
oppressors
many
and
my
men
but
few
few
quoth
sir
fidelis
speaking
with
head
few
messire
not
so
ten
thousand
lances
might
follow
thee
an
thou
but
spake
the
word
nay
sighed
beltane
mock
me
not
good
fidelis
thou
dost
know
me
a
lonely
man
and
friendless
to
whom
should
i
speak
to
one
that
loveth
thee
now
as
ever
to
one
that
yearneth
for
thee
with
heart
nigh
to
breaking
to
helen
ah
quoth
beltane
slow
and
bitter
speak
word
to
helen
the
beautiful
the
wilful
the
wanton
no
a
thousand
times
rather
would
i
perish
i
and
all
my
hopes
than
seek
aid
of
such
as
she
lovest
thou
pentavalon
indeed
messire
nay
methinks
better
far
thou
dost
love
thy
cold
and
cruel
pride
so
must
pentavalon
endure
her
grievous
wrongs
and
so
do
i
pity
her
but
most
of
all
i
pity
thee
messire
now
would
beltane
have
answered
but
found
no
word
and
therefore
fell
to
black
and
bitter
anger
and
turning
on
his
heel
incontinent
strode
away
into
the
where
a
banquet
had
been
spread
frowning
he
ate
and
drank
in
haste
scarce
heeding
the
words
addressed
to
him
wherefore
others
grew
silent
also
and
thereafter
his
hunger
assuaged
strode
he
out
into
the
square
and
summoned
his
company
men
of
pentavalon
spake
he
loud
and
quick
howso
poor
and
humble

be
henceforth
ye
shall
go

and
every
equipped
in
knightly
mail

as
secure
as
flesh
of
any
potent
lord
or
noble
of
them
all
henceforth
each
man
of
us
must
fight
as
valiantly
as
ten
now
if
any
there
be
who
know
the
manage
of
horse
and
lance
let
him
step
forth
hereupon
divers
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
and
beltane
counted
of
these
fifty
and
two
master
reeve
spake
beltane

guerdon
instead
of

comrades

lances
and
mail
complete
with
goodly
bascinets

shall
be
done
my
lord
roger
in
thy
command
i
set
these
fifty
lances

now
to
their
arming
let
them
be
mounted
and
ready
with
speed
for
in
this
hour
we
ride
aye
master
cried
roger
his
eyes
that
will
i
moreover
walkyn
to
thee
i
give
the
pikes
henceforth
as
for
our
archers
giles
which
now
think
you
fittest
to
command
why
truly
brother
my
lord
if
one
there
be
can
twang
a
lusty
bow
and
hath
a
cool
and
head
is
jenkyn
o
the
ford
and
after
him

and
after
him
jenkyn
do
you
henceforth
look
to
our
archers

these
matters
heard
and
known
among
ye

came
the
thunderous
answer

well
for
mark
me
we
go
out
to
desperate
doings
wherein
obedience
must
be
instant
wherein
all
must
love
like
brothers
and
like
brothers
fight
shoulder
to
shoulder
now
came
there
certain
of
the
citizens
to
beltane
leading
a
great
and
noble
richly
caparisoned
meet
for
his
acceptance
and
thus
ere
the
moon
rose
equipped
with
lance
and
shield
and
ponderous
vizored
casque
beltane
gloomy
and
silent
with
sir
fidelis
mounted
beside
him
rode
forth
at
the
head
of
his
grim
array
at
whose
tramp
and
jingle
the
folk
of
belsaye
shouted
joyful
acclaim
while
the
bells
rang
out
right
joyously
chapter
xxxviii
of
beltane
black
and
evil
mood
and
how
he
fell
in
with
the
witch
of
hangstone
waste
it
was
very
dark
upon
the
forest
road
where
trees
loomed
gigantic
against
the
pitchy
gloom
wherein
branches
creaked
and
swayed
and
leaves
rustled
faint
and
fitful
in
the
stealthy
and
through
the
gloom
at
the
head
of
his
silent
company
beltane
rode
in
frowning
thought
his
humour
blacker
than
the
night
now
in
a
while
sir
fidelis
riding
ever
at
his
elbow
ventured
speech
with
him
art
very
silent
messire
have
i
angered
thee
forsooth
is
aught
amiss
betwixt
us
quoth
beltane
shortly
art
sir
knight
and
therefore
fond
and
foolish
is
a
man
a
lover
of
self
because
he
hateth
dishonour
art
a
presumptuous
youth
and
that
amiss
art
thou
so
ancient
messire
and
therefore
so
wise
as
to
judge
thy
hates
and
loves
and
the
abiding
sorrows
of
pentavalon
questioned
fidelis
and
gentle
old
enough
am
i
to
know
that
in
all
this
world
is
no
baser
thing
than
the
treachery
of
a
faithless
woman
and
that
he
who
seeketh
aid
of
such
though
his
cause
be
just
dishonoureth
himself
and
eke
his
cause
so
god
keep
me
from
all
women
henceforth
and
as
for
thee
speak
me
no
more

name
of
this
light
wanton

sir
fidelis
leaning
near
my
lord

mean
but
mortain

helen
the
beautiful
now
cried
sir
fidelis
as
one
that
feels
a
blow
and
in
the
dark
he
seized
beltane
in
sudden
griping
fingers
and
shook
him
fiercely
and
dare
ye
name
her
he
cried
ye
shall
not
i
say
ye
shall
not
but
laughing
beltane
smote
away
the
young
knight
hold
and
laughed
again

this
light
lady

so
dear
to
thee
poor
youthful
fool
said
he
aye
me
doubt
not
her
falsity

break
thy
heart
some
day
and
teach
thee

shout
among
the

came
and
went
amid

underbrush
and
walkyn
appeared
bearing
a
lighted
brand
lord
he
growled
here
has
been
devil
work
of
late
for
yonder
a
cottage
lieth
a
heap
of
glowing
ashes
and
upon
a
tree
hard
by
a
dead
man
doth
swing
learned
ye
aught
else
walkyn
nothing
save
that
a
large
company
passed
here
yesterday
as
i
judge
horse
and
foot
going
south
see
you
and
he
held
his
torch
to
the
trampled
road
going
south
aye
walkyn
to
barham
broom
methinks
here
is
another
debt
shall
yet
be
paid
in
full
mayhap
quoth
beltane
grimly
forward
the
jingling
column
moved
on
again
yet
had
gone
but
a
little
way
when
sir
fidelis
uttering
a
cry
swerved
his
horse
suddenly
and
sprang
to
earth
what
now
questioned
beltane
staring
into
the
murk
my
lord
my
lord
a
woman
lieth
here
and
ah
messire
she
is
dead
o
a
woman
quoth
beltane
and
dead
say
you
why
then
the
world
shall
know
less
of
evil
and
treachery
methinks
come
mount
sir
knight
mount
i
say
and
let
us
on
but
sir
fidelis
on
his
knees
beside
that
silent
form
heeded
him
not
at
all
and
with
reverent
folded
hands
and
soft
and
tender
voice
spake
a
prayer
for
the
departed
soul
now
hereupon
beltane
knew
sudden
shame
and
swift
remorse
and
bowed
his
head
also
and
would
have
prayed
yet
could
not
wherefore
his
black
mood
deepened
and
his
anger
grew
more
bitter
mount
mount
sir
knight
cried
he
harshly
better
to
seek
vengeance
dire
than
mumble
on
thy
knees
mount
i
say
forthwith
sir
fidelis
arose
nothing
speaking
and
being
in
the
saddle
reined
back
and
suffered
beltane
to
ride
alone
but
in
a
while
beltane
perceiving
himself
thus
shunned
found
therein
a
new
grievance
and
fiercely
summoned
sir
fidelis
beside
him
wherefore
slink
ye
behind
me
he
demanded
then
spake
sir
fidelis
in
voice
full
low
and
troubled
my
lord
beltane
was
said
thou
wert
a
noble
knight
very
strong
and
very
gentle
ha
dost
think
such
report
a
lie
mayhap
alas
sighed
the
young
knight
and
again
alas
and
therewith
a
great
sob
brake
from
him
of
a
sudden
from
the
gloom
beside
the
way
rose
a
woman
scream
and
thereafter
a
great
and
fierce
roar
and
presently
came
walkyn
with
his
torch
and
divers
of
his
men
dragging
a
woman
in
their
midst
and
lo
it
was
the
witch
of
hangstone
waste
now
she
beholding
beltane
face
beneath
his
lifted
vizor
cried
out
for
very
joy
now
heaven
bless
thee
duke
beltane
ah
my
lord
hear
me
what
would
ye
what
seek
ye
of
such
as
i
but
hereupon
black
roger
spurred
beside
beltane
his
eyes
wide
and
fearful
in
the
shadow
of
his
helm
his
strong
mailed
hand
on
beltane
arm
beware
my
lord
beware
he
cried
is
nigh
the
midnight
hour
and
she
a
noted
witch
heed
her
not
lest
she
blight
thy
fair
body
lest
she
peace
roger
now
speak
woman
what
would
ye
a
life
my
lord
ah
the
blessed
saints
forfend
i
feared
so
gasped
roger
but
now
the
witch
turned
and
looked
on
roger
and
he
incontinent
crossed
himself
and
fell
thenceforth
to
mumbling
prayers
beneath
his
breath
lord
duke
for
that
i
am
but
a
woman
poor
and
helpless
now
would
i
beseech
thine
aid
for
nay
tell
me
first
whence
come
ye
from
barham
broom
messire
ah
spare
aid
for
one
that
lieth
in
peril
of
death
the
maid
mellent
they
do
proclaim
her
witch
they
will
burn
her
o
a
woman
quoth
beltane
wrinkling
his
brows
and
beholding
sir
fidelis
watching
him
straightway
frowned
the
blacker
nay
messire
hear
me
cried
the
witch
ah
turn
not
away
this
maid
indeed
is
not
of
common
blood
a
lady
is
she
of
birth
and
wide
demesnes
why
then
said
beltane
heedful
ever
of
the
young
knight
burning
glance
why
then
is
she
more
apt
for
treachery
and
evil
not
so
my
lord
weak
is
she
and
beset
by
cruel
enemies
i
found
her
a
stranger
wandering
lonely
in
the
green
and
she
being
sick
of
heart
and
brain
spake
wild
words
of
a
great
wrong
vainly
done
and
suffered
and
of
an
abiding
remorse
and
when
i
had
nursed
her
into
health
she
told
me
a
wondrous
tale
so
lord
beltane
do
i
know
that
in
her
hands
thy
happiness
doth
lie
not
so
sighed
beltane
happiness
and
i
are
strangers
henceforth
but
here
once
again
came
a
hoarse
and
angry
roar
with
the
sound
of
desperate
struggling
amid
the
leaves
hard
by
whence
came
jenkyn
and
orson
with
divers
others
dragging
a
strange
hairy
creature
great
and
shaggy
of
head
and
with
the
arms
and
shoulders
of
a
giant
smirched
was
he
in
blood
from
a
great
wound
above
the
brow
and
his
rich
habit
was
mired
and
torn
now
looking
upon
this
monstrous
creature
that
writhed
and
struggled
mightily
with
his
captors
groaning
and
roaring
betimes
beltane
felt
his
flesh
with
swift
and
pregnant
memory
and
straightway
beset
the
witch
with
fierce
question
woman
what
thing
is
this
my
lord
is
naught
but
poor
ulf
a
natural
messire
very
strong
and
faithful
that
hath
fought
mightily
and
is
nigh
slain
in
our
defence
see
how
he
bleeds
let
them
not
harm
him
my
lord
yet
have
i
seen
him
ere
this
methinks
but
for
the
maid
mellent
thou
wilt
not
let
her
burn
and
for
thy
deeds
mine
forsooth
how
mean
you
was
we
were
beset
hereabouts
by
a
lewd
company
and
brought
unto
their
lord
sir
grilles
of
brandonmere
a
man
beyond
all
other
men
base
and
vile
who
beholding
her
so
young
and
fair
would
have
forced
her
to
his
will
ha
methinks
sir
gilles
doth
live
too
long
so
to
save
her
from
his
violence
i
discovered
to
him
her
name
and
high
estate
whereupon
at
first
he
would
fain
have
her
wed
with
him
but
angered
by
her
scorn
he
bore
her
with
him
to
duke
ivo
at
barham
broom
and
me
also
and
there
i
heard
her
denounced
as
witch
by
whose
spells
thou
lord
beltane
wert
freed
of
thy
duress
and
garthlaxton
utterly
destroyed
thus
she
must
burn
unless
one
can
be
found
to
champion
her
cause
and
prove
her
innocent
by
trial
of
combat
so
when
they
had
let
me
go
i
came
seeking
thee
my
lord
since
is
said
thou
art
a
very
strong
man
and
swift
to
aid
the
defenceless
now
glancing
aside
upon
sir
fidelis
beltane
beheld
him
leaning
forward
with
his
lips
apart
and
slender
hands
whereupon
he
frowned
and
shook
his
head
a
woman
quoth
he
nay
i
had
rather
fight
in
a
dog
cause
forsooth
cried
roger
for
rogue
is
he
and
fool
that
would
champion
a
vile
witch
why
then
let
us
on
lord
growled
walkyn
why
tarry
we
here
but
now
as
the
witch
sank
upon
the
road
with
pleading
hands
uplifted
sir
fidelis
rode
beside
her
and
stooping
caught
her
outstretched
hands
quoth
he
of
what
avail
to
plead
with
such
as
these
so
will
i
adventure
me
on
behalf
of
this
poor
maid
enough
cried
beltane
walkyn
march

and
all
for
hundleby
fen
wait
me
there
and
let
your
watch
be
strict
but
an

within
two
days
from

then

as

roger
he

to

ha
lord

then
in
the
witch

cried
walkyn
aye
forsooth

i
had
rather
fight
in
a
dog
cause
for
a
dog
see
you

a
faithful
beast
to
barham
broom
quoth
roger
staring
thou
and
i
master
to
black
ivo
alone
and
speaking
he
loosened
sword
in
scabbard
my
lord
beltane
cried
sir
fidelis
beholding
him
with
shining
eyes
an
thou
wilt
do
this
noble
thing
suffer
me
beside
thee
not
so
messire
answered
beltane
shaking
his
head
art

and
tender
methinks

thee
keep
thou
thy
fond
and
foolish
dream
and

thy
gentle
heart
go
unbroken
come
roger
so
saying
beltane
wheeled
about
and
rode
away
with
roger
at
his
heels
chapter
xxxix
how
beltane
fought
for
one
mellent
that
was
a
witch
barham
broom
was
gay
with
the
stir
of
flags
and
streamers
where
above
broidered
pavilion
and
silken
tent
pennons
and
banderoles
penoncels
and
gonfalons
fluttered
and
flew
beyond
which
long
lines
of
smaller
tents
stretched
away
north
and
south
east
and
west
and
made
up
the
camp
of
my
lord
duke
ivo
beyond
the
confines
of
this
great
and
goodly
camp
the
lists
had
been
formed
and
here
from
earliest
dawn
a
great
concourse
had
been
gathering
villein
and
vassal
serf
and
freedman
from
town
and
village
noble
lords
and
ladies
fair
from
castle
hall
and
perfumed
bower
all
were
here
for
a
witch
was
to
die
from
her
tortured
flesh
the
flame
was
to
drive
forth
and
exorcize
once
and
for
all
the
demon
who
possessed
her
by
whose
vile
aid
she
wrought
her
charms
and
spells
so
country
wenches
pushed
and
strove
amid
the
throng
and
dainty
ladies
leaned
from
canopied
galleries
to
shudder
with
dread
or
trill
soft
laughter
but
each
and
every
stared
at
one
who
stood
alone
armed
guards
so
young
and
fair
and
pale
within
her
bonds
oft
turning
piteous
face
to
heaven
or
looking
with
quailing
eye
where
stake
and
chain
and
faggot
menaced
her
with
awful
doom
and
ever
the
kindly
sun
rose
high
and
higher
and
ever
the
staring
concourse
grew
now
of
a
sudden
the
clarions
rang
out
a
point
of
war
and
all
voices
were
hushed
as
forth
into
the
lists
upon
his
charger
my
lord
duke
ivo
rode
followed
by
his
chiefest
lords
and
barons
and
as
he
rode
he
smiled
to
himself
full
oft
as
one
that
meditates
a
hidden
jest
being
come
where
the
witch
stood
her
disordered
garments
rent
by
vicious
handling
striving
to
veil
her
beauty
in
her
long
dark
hair
my
lord
duke
reined
in
his
pawing
steed
to
sit
a
while
and
look
down
at
her
sleepy
lids
and
ever
as
he
looked
his
arching
nostrils
fluttered
above
curling
lip
and
ever
he
fingered
his
long
chin
alack
cried
he
at
last
is
a
comely
wench
and
full
young
methinks
to
die
so
soon
but
witchcraft
is
a
deadly
sin
abhorred
by
man
and
hateful
unto
god
my
lord
my
lord
spake
the
witch
swift
and
passionate
yet
trembling
his
sleepy
gaze
thou
knowest
i
am
no
witch
indeed
thou
knowest
nay
nay
quoth
the
duke
shaking
his
head
and
coming
more
near
he
stooped
and
spake
her
nay
she
thou
name
was
a
lady
proud
soft
and
white
with
hair
bright
and
glorious
as
the
sun
in
sooth
a
fair
lady
yet
something
too
ambitious
but
thou
though
of
her
size
and
shape
art
of
a
dark
and
swarthy
hue
and
thy
hair
black
meseemeth
of
a
verity
thou
art
only
the
witch
mellent
and
so
by
reason
of
thy
skin
and
raven
hair
aye
and
for
thy
witchcraft
thou
alack
must
die
unless
thou
find
thee
a
champion
verily
i
fear
me
no
man
will
dare
take
up
thy
cause
for
sir
gilles
is
a
lusty
man
and
famous
at
the
joust
moreover
my
will
is
known
in
the
matter
so
do
i
fear
there
none
shall
come
to
fight
on
thy
behalf
alack
that
one
should
die
so
young
ah
my
lord
my
lord
ivo
she
whispered
eager
and
breathless
show
me
a
little
mercy
for
that
to
be
thy
duchess
i
denied
thee
thy
desire
in
the
past
let
me
now
be
prisoned
all
my
days
an
it
be
thy
will
but
give
me
not
to
the
fire
ah
god
not
the
fire
pity
pity
me
for
what
i
did
for
thee
be
merciful
did
wench
did
quoth
the
duke
gently
now
when
spake
i
with
witch
ere
this
is
true
there
was
a
lady
something
of
thy
seeming
who
to
gain
much
promised
much
and
achieved
me
nothing
so
now
do
i
know
thee
far
one
mellent
a
notable
witch
that
shall
this
day
instead
of
ducal
crown
wear
crown
of
flame
alack
and
so
farewell
thus
speaking
my
lord
duke
rode
on
up
the
lists
where
stood
certain
noble
lords
to
hold
his
stirrup
and
aid
him
to
earth
so
mounted
he
to
his
place
broidered
canopy
and
many
a
fair
cheek
blanched
and
many
a
stout
knight
faltered
in
his
speech
beholding
that
stealthy
smile
and
the
twitch
of
those
thin
nostrils
now
once
again
the
trumpet
blew
and
a
herald
stepped
forth
god
save
ye
lord
duke
he
cried
ye
noble
lords
and
ladies
fair
good
people
all
god
save
ye
know
that
before
you
here
assembled
hath
been
brought
one
mellent
that
hath
been
denounced
a
notable
witch
and
sorceress
who
by
her
fiendish
arts
and
by
the
aid
of
demons
foul
and
damned
doth
seek
the
hurt
of
our
lord
the
duke
whom
god
and
the
saints
defend
forasmuch
as
this
witch
yclept
mellent
did
by
her
unhallowed
spells
and
magic
compass
and
bring
about
the
escape
from
close
duress
of
one
beltane
a
notable
outlaw
malefactor
and
enemy
to
our
lord
the
duke
and
whereas
she
did
also
by
aid
of
charms
incantations
and
the
like
devilish
practices
contrive
the
sack
burning
and
total
destruction
of
my
lord
duke
good
and
fair
castle
of
garthlaxton
upon
the
march
now
therefore
it
is
adjudged
that
she
be
taken
and
her
body
burned
to
ashes
here
before
you
all
of
which
charges
have
been
set
forth
and
sworn
to
by
this
right
noble
lord
and
gallant
knight
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
behold
him
here
in
person
hereupon
while
the
trumpets
brayed
a
flourish
and
fanfare
forth
rode
sir
gilles
upon
a
mighty
charger
a
grim
and
warlike
figure
in
his
shining
mail
and
blazoned
surcoat
his
ponderous
crested
closed
his
long
shield
covering
him
from
shoulder
to
stirrup
and
his
twinkling
on
high
then
spake
again
the
herald
loud
and
clear
good
people
all
behold
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
who
cometh
here
before
you
prepared
to
maintain
the
truth
and
justice
of
the
charges
he
hath
made
unto
the
death
any
man
soever
on
horse
or
on
foot
with
lance
or
sword
now
if
there
be
any
here
do
know
this
witch
mellent
for
innocent
if
there
be
any
here
dare
adventure
his
body
for
her
innocence
and
run
the
peril
of
mortal
combat
with
sir
gilles
let
him
now
stand
forth
and
immediately
the
trumpets
sounded
a
challenge
thereafter
the
herald
paced
slowly
round
the
lists
and
behind
him
rode
sir
gilles
his
blazon
of
the
three
stooping
falcons
plain
for
all
men
to
see
on
gleaming
shield
and
surcoat
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
the
challenge
was
repeated
and
after
each
the
trumpet
sounded
a
warlike
flourish
yet
no
horseman
paced
forth
and
no
man
leapt
the
barriers
and
the
witch
mellent
drooped
pale
and
trembling
betwixt
her
warders
but
of
a
sudden
she
opened
swooning
eyes
and
lifted
her
heavy
head
for
from
the
distant
woods
faint
as
yet
and
far
a
horn
brayed
hoarsely
three
notes
thrice
repeated
defiant
and
warlike
and
now
among
the
swaying
crowds
rose
a
hum
that
grew
and
grew
while
ever
and
anon
the
horn
rang
out
fiercely
winded
and
ever
it
sounded
nearer
until
of
a
sudden
out
from
the
trees
afar
two
horsemen
galloped
their
harness
bright
in
the
sunshine
helm
and
twinkling
who
spurring
knee
and
knee
thundered
over
the
ling
while
every
tongue
grew
hushed
and
every
eye
turned
to
mark
their
swift
career
tall
were
these
men
and
lusty
bedight
from
head
to
foot
in
glistening
mail
alike
at
all
points
save
that
one
bare
neither
shield
nor
lance
and
his
open
bascinet
showed
a
face
brown
and
comely
whereas
his
companion
rode
his
long
shield
flashing
in
the
sun
his
head
and
face
hid
by
reason
of
his
ponderous
casque
swift
they
rode
the
throng
parting
before
them
knee
and
knee
together
they
leapt
the
palisade
and
reining
in
their
horses
paced
down
the
lists
and
halted
before
the
pale
and
trembling
captive
then
spake
the
knight
behind
his
vizor
sound
roger
forthwith
the
ruddy
man
set
a
hunting
horn
to
his
lips
and
blew
thereon
a
flourish
so
loud
and
shrill
as
made
the
very
welkin
ring
now
came
pursuivants
and
the
chief
herald
which
last
made
inquisition
thus
sir
knight
crest
hast
thou
none
nor
on
thy
shield
device
so
do
i
demand
name
and
rank
of
thee
who
thus
in
knightly
guise
doth
give
this
bold
defiance
and
wherefore
ye
ride
armed
at
points
pronounce
messire
then
spake
the
tall
knight
loud
and
fierce
his
voice
within
the
hollow
of
his
closed
casque
name
and
rank
have
i
laid
by
for
the
nonce
until
i
shall
have
achieved
a
certain
vow
but
of
noble
blood
am
i
and
kin
unto
the
greatest
this
do
i
swear
by
holy
rood
am
i
hither
come
in
arms
to
do
battle
on
behalf
of
yon
innocent
maid
and
to
maintain
her
innocence
so
long
as
strength
abide
and
furthermore
here
before
ye
all
and
every
i
do
proclaim
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
a
shame
and
reproach
unto
his
order
to
all
the
world
i
do
proclaim
him
rogue
and
thief
and
wilful
liar
the
which
god
willing
i
will
here
prove
upon
his
vile
body
so
now
let
there
be
an
end
of
words
sound
roger
hereupon
he
of
the
ruddy
cheek
clapped
horn
to
lip
and
blew
amain
until
his
cheek
grew
redder
yet
what
time
the
heralds
and
pursuivants
and
marshals
of
the
field
debated
together
if
it
were
lawful
for
a
nameless
knight
to
couch
lance
one
of
noble
blood
but
now
came
sir
gilles
himself
choking
with
rage
and
fuming
in
his
harness
ha
thou
nameless
dog
cried
he
brandishing
his
heavy
lance
be
thou
serf
or
noble
art
an
errant
liar
so
will
i
slay
thee
out
of
hand
thus
saying
he
reined
round
the
great
roan
stallion
he
bestrode
and
galloped
to
one
end
of
the
lists
now
spake
black
roger
and
his
hand
shook
upon
his
bridle
master
now
do
i
fear
for
thee
sir
gilles
is
a
mighty
jouster
and
skilled
withal
moreover
he
rideth
his
famous
horse
mars
a
noble
beast
and
fresh
while
thine
is
something
wearied
and
then
master
direst
of
all
she
thou
champion
is
a
witch
that
worketh
no
evil
by
day
roger
so
do
i
charge
thee
betide
look
to
the
maid
take
her
across
thy
saddle
and
strive
to
bring
her
to
safety
as
for
me
i
will
now
with
might
and
main
seek
to
make
an
end
of
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
so
saying
beltane
rode
to
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
lists
and
now
while
the
trumpets
blared
the
two
knights
took
their
ground
sir
gilles
resplendent
in
lofty
crest
and
emblazoned
surcoat
the
three
stooping
falcons
conspicuous
on
his
shield
his
mighty
roan
charger
pawing
the
ling
with
impatient
hoof
his
opponent
a
gleaming
figure
astride
a
tall
black
horse
his
casque
unadorned
by
plume
or
crest
so
awhile
they
remained
very
still
and
silent
what
time
a
single
trumpet
spake
whereat
behold
the
two
long
lances
sank
feutred
to
the
charge
the
broad
shields
flashed
glittered
and
were
still
again
and
from
that
great
concourse
a
sound
went
up
a
hum
that
swelled
and
so
was
gone
the
maid
mellent
had
sunk
upon
her
knees
and
was
praying
desperate
prayers
with
face
upturned
to
heaven
but
none
was
there
to
mark
her
now
amid
that
silent
gathering
all
eyes
were
strained
to
watch
those
grim
and
silent
horsemen
that
fronted
each
other
the
length
of
the
lists
between
even
duke
ivo
leaning
on
lazy
elbow
looked
with
glowing
eye
and
cheek
ere
he
let
fall
his
truncheon
and
on
the
instant
shrill
and
fierce
the
trumpets
brayed
and
on
the
instant
each
knight
struck
spurs
the
powerful
horses
reared
plunged
and
sprang
away
at
speed
fast
and
faster
they
galloped
their
riders
above
the
saddles
shields
addressed
and
lances
steady
with
pounding
hooves
that
sent
the
turves
with
gleaming
helms
and
deadly
fast
and
ever
faster
they
thundered
down
upon
each
other
till
with
a
sudden
direful
crash
they
met
in
full
career
with
a
splintering
of
lances
a
lashing
of
wild
hooves
a
rearing
of
powerful
horses
staggering
and
reeling
beneath
the
shock
and
now
a
thunderous
cry
went
up
for
the
tall
black
horse
plunging
and
snorting
went
down
rolling
upon
the
sward
but
his
rider
had
leapt
clear
and
stumbling
to
his
feet
stood
swaying
unsteadily
faint
and
dazed
with
the
blow
of
sir
gilles
lance
that
had
borne
down
the
great
black
horse
and
torn
the
heavy
casque
from
his
head
so
stood
beltane
unhelmed
staring
dazedly
from
heaving
earth
to
reeling
heaven
yet
of
a
sudden
shook
aloft
the
fragment
of
his
splintered
lance
and
laughed
fierce
and
loud
to
behold
reeling
earth
and
sky
a
great
roan
stallion
that
foamed
upon
his
bit
rein
as
swaying
sideways
from
the
lofty
saddle
sir
gilles
of
brandonmere
crashed
to
earth
transfixed
through
shield
and
hauberk
through
breast
and
back
upon
the
shaft
of
a
broken
lance
high
over
him
leapt
beltane
to
catch
the
roan
loose
bridle
to
swing
himself
up
and
so
with
stirrups
flying
and
amid
a
sudden
clamour
of
roaring
voices
to
thunder
down
the
lists
where
roger
heavy
sword
flashed
as
smiting
right
and
left
he
stooped
and
swung
the
maid
mellent
before
him
ride
roger
ride
spur
spur
shouted
beltane
above
the
gathering
din
and
shouting
drew
his
sword
for
now
before
them
steel
glittered
and
cries
rang
upon
the
air
is
beltane
the
outlaw
seize
him
slay
him
is
the
outlaw
but
knee
and
knee
with
loose
rein
and
goading
spur
rode
they
and
nought
could
avail
and
none
were
quick
enough
to
stay
that
headlong
gallop
side
by
side
they
thundered
over
the
ling
and
knee
and
knee
they
leapt
the
barrier
bursting
through
bewildered
soldiery
scattering
frighted
and
so
away
over
gorse
and
heather
and
with
arrows
drawn
at
a
venture
whistling
by
them
betimes
they
reached
the
shelter
of
the
woods
and
turning
beltane
beheld
a
confusion
of
armed
men
and
what
time
borne
upon
the
air
came
a
sound
hoarse
and
menacing
a
sound
dreadful
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
hue
and
cry
chapter
xl
further
concerning
the
maid
mellent
and
of
the
hue
and
cry
fast
they
galloped
the
trees
stooping
ever
and
anon
to
avoid
some
branch
through
grassy
rides
and
sunny
glades
until
all
sound
of
pursuit
was
died
away
so
turning
aside
into
the
denser
green
beltane
stayed
and
sprang
down
to
tighten
the
great
strained
in
the
encounter
now
as
he
was
busied
thus
came
the
maid
mellent
very
pale
her
long
black
hair
and
spake
him
and
humble
my
lord
beltane
thou
at
peril
of
thy
body
hath
saved
a
sorrowful
maid
from
the
fiery
torment
so
to
prove
my
gratitude
and
sorrow
for
past
ill
now
will
i
tell
thee
that
in
saving
me
thou
hast
saved
one
that
for
ambition
sake
once
did
thee
grievous
wrong
thou
saith
beltane
staring
in
amaze
hast
thou
seen
me
until
this
day
verily
messire
o
messire
thou
hast
indeed
seen
me
ere
this
and
to
my
bitter
sorrow
for
i
who
speak
am
the
lady
winfrida
nay
nay
stammered
beltane
here
is
thing
impossible
thy
hair
is
but
a
wile
that
many
women
do
know
messire
a
device
of
the
witch
jolette
that
is
no
witch
but
a
noble
woman
a
device
whereby
i
might
lie
hid
awhile
o
indeed
indeed
i
who
speak
to
thee
am
the
wicked
winfrida
winfrida
the
sorrowful
now
herewith
she
sank
before
him
on
her
knees
and
bowed
her
face
within
her
hands
and
beltane
saw
that
she
trembled
greatly
my
lord
she
whispered
now
must
i
confess
a
thing
beyond
all
words
shameful
and
though
i
fear
death
i
fear
thy
anger
more
if
therefore
when
i
have
spoke
thee
all
thou
wilt
slay
me
then
o
my
lord
i
pray
thee
let
death
come
swift
master
cried
roger
of
a
sudden
i
hear
horses
they
be
after
us
already
mount
mount
and
let
us
ride
hark
they
come
this
way
aye
nodded
beltane
drawing
his
sword
yet
here
is
but
one
methinks
list
roger
leave
him
to
me
so
waited
they
all
three
what
time
the
hoofs
drew
near
and
nearer
until
peering
through
the
leaves
they
beheld
a
knight
who
rode
in
his
saddle
to
mark
their
tracks
plain
upon
the
tender
grass
forth
stepped
beltane
fierce
and
threatening
his
long
sword
agleam
and
so
paused
to
scowl
for
the
knight
raised
his
head
of
a
sudden
and
lo
was
sir
fidelis
now
what
seek
ye
here
sir
knight
saith
beltane
nothing
gentle
thee
my
lord
quoth
fidelis
meek
of
aspect
to
share
thy
perils
according
to
thy
word
put
up
thy
sword
messire
thou
wilt
not
harm
thy
companion
in
arms
now
beltane
finding
nought
to
say
scowled
sulkily
to
earth
and
thus
saw
nothing
of
the
eyes
so
deep
and
tender
that
watched
him
the
shadow
of
the
young
knight
bascinet
nor
the
smile
so
sad
and
wistful
that
curled
his
ruddy
lips
nor
all
the
lithe
and
slender
grace
of
him
as
he
swayed
to
the
impatient
movements
of
the
powerful
animal
he
bestrode
but
it
chanced
that
winfrida
eyes
saw
all
this
and
being
a
woman
eyes
beheld
that
which
gave
her
breathing
sudden
pause
turned
her
red
turned
her
pale
until
with
a
gasp
of
fear
she
started
and
uttering
a
cry
low
and
inarticulate
sped
across
the
glade
and
was
gone
quoth
beltane
staring
now
what
aileth
the
maid
think
ye
but
is
no
matter
we
are
well
quit
of
her
meseemeth
so
saying
he
turned
to
behold
roger
flat
upon
his
belly
and
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
master
cried
he
master
there
be
horsemen
i
the
forest
hereabouts
a
great
company
why
then
do
you
mount
roger
and
hie
thee
with
sir
fidelis
to
walkyn
at
hundleby
fen
bid
him
set
our
bowmen
in
every
place
of
vantage
and
let
every
man
stand
to
arms
so
mayhap
roger
will
we
this
day
make
hunted
men
of
them
that
hunt
so
saying
beltane
swung
to
saddle
aye
aye
but
what
o
thee
master
mark
ye
this
horse
roger
thou
hast
said
was
of
good
speed
and
endurance
and
methinks
is

howbeit
now
shall
he
prove
thy
word
for
here
i
wait
the
hunters
and
will
i
keeping
ever
out
of
lead

every
quag

bog
and
marsh

and
hundleby
fen
and
of
those
that
follow
still
thou
and
walkyn
and
our
merry
men
shall
make
an
end
i
pray
god
so
let
all
lie
well
hid
and
watch
for
my
coming
and
now
farewell
to
thee
roger
but
master
quoth
roger
waxing
rueful
in
this
thou
must
run
dire
perils
and
dangers
and
i
not
with
thee
so
pray
thee
let
sir
fidelis
hard
ha
now
god
aid
us
hark
to
that
master
they
loosed
the
dogs
on
us
even
as
he
spake
very
faint
and
far
as
yet
but
plain
to
hear
above
the
leafy
stirring
the
deep
baying
of
a
hound
came
down
the
wind
master
ride
ride
quoth
roger
wiping
sweat
from
him
o
sweet
christ
forgive
me
for
i
have
hunted
down
poor
rogues
with
such
ere
now
forsooth
roger
and
now
is
their
turn
to
hunt
thee
mayhap
howbeit
ride
you
at
speed
and
you
sir
knight
also
get
you
gone
and
whatsoever
betide
roger
wait
you
at
hundleby
fen
for
me
go
obey
me
so
looking
upon
beltane
with
eyes
of
yearning
black
roger
perforce
wheeled
and
rode
out
into
the
glade
and
striking
spurs
to
his
eager
steed
galloped
swiftly
away
now
turned
beltane
upon
sir
fidelis
how
messire
are
ye
not
gone
then
answered
sir
fidelis
his
drooping
head
averted
thou
seest
my
lord
i
go
beside
thee
according
to
thy
word
presumptuous
youth
i
want
thee
not
the
day
will
yet
come
perchance
my
lord
and
i
can
be
patient
ha
dost
defy
me
not
so
my
lord
nor
do
i
fear
thee
for
i
do
know
thee
better
than
thyself
so
do
i
pity
thee
pity
thee
thou
that
art
so
mighty
and
yet
so
weak
thou
art
a
babe
weeping
in
a
place
of
shadows
so
will
i
go
beside
thee
in
the
dark
to
soothe
and
comfort
thee
thou
art
a
noble
man
thy
better
self
lost
awhile
sickly
fancies
god
send
they
soon
may
pass
till
then
i
can
be
very
patient
my
lord
beltane
now
did
beltane
stare
with
eyes
of
wonder
upon
sir
fidelis
who
managed
his
fretting
charger
with
a
gracious
ease
yet
held
his
face
ever
averted
while
upon
the
stilly
air
loud
and
more
loud
rose
the
fierce
baying
of
the
hounds
said
beltane
at
last
messire
thou
dost
hear
the
hounds
in
faith
my
lord
i
tremble
to
be
gone
but
an
thou
dost
tarry
so
must
i
death
shall
follow
hard
after
us
this
day
sir
fidelis
why
then
an
death
us
i
must
die
messire
ha
the
hounds
have
winded
us
already
methinks
hark
hark
to
them
and
in
truth
the
air
was
full
of
their
raving
clamour
with
ever
and
anon
the
shouts
and
cries
of
those
that
urged
them
on
hast
a
noble
horse
sir
fidelis
now
god
send
he
bear
thee
well
this
day
for
be
hard
and
cruel
going
come
is
time
methinks
thus
speaking
beltane
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
forth
they
rode
together
out
into
the
broad
and
open
glade
their
armour
glinting
in
the
sun
and
immediately
the
dogs
gave
tongue
louder
fiercer
than
before
now
looking
back
beltane
beheld
afar
many
mounted
men
who
shouted
amain
flourishing
lance
and
sword
while
divers
others
let
slip
the
great
dogs
they
held
in
leash
then
looking
up
the
glade
ahead
and
noting
its
smooth
level
and
goodly
length
beltane
smiled
grimly
and
drew
sword
sir
fidelis
said
he
hast
a
mace
at
thy
betake
thee
to
it
is
a
goodly
weapon
and
smite
hard
be
the
dogs
first
now
spur
forward
bounded
the
two
steeds
gathering
pace
with
every
stride
but
the
great
hounds
came
on
amain
while
beyond
distant
as
yet
the
hunters
rode
knight
and
squire
mounted
bowman
and
they
spurred
and
shouted
filling
the
air
with
fierce
halloo
slowly
the
hounds
drew
nearer
ten
great
beasts
beltane
counted
that
galloped
two
and
two
whining
and
whimpering
as
they
came
now
of
a
sudden
beltane
checked
in
his
career
swerved
swung
the
plunging
roan
and
with
long
blade
agleam
rode
in
upon
the
racing
pack
to
meet
their
rush
with
deadly
point
and
edge
a
slavering
hound
launched
itself
at
his
throat
its
fangs
clashing
on
the
stout
links
of
his
camail
but
as
the
great
beast
hung
thus
striving
to
drag
him
from
the
saddle
down
came
the
mace
of
sir
fidelis
and
the
snarling
beast
fell
to
be
crushed
the
trampling
hoofs
of
the
mars
and
now
did
the
mighty
roan
prove
himself
a
very
mars
indeed
for
beset
round
about
by
fierce
lean
shapes
that
crouched
and
leapt
with
cruel
gleaming
fangs
he
stamped
and
reared
and
fought
them
off
neighing
loud
defiance
thus
with
lashing
hoof
with
whirling
mace
and
darting
sword
fought
they
until
of
the
hounds
there
none
remained
save
three
that
limped
painfully
to
cover
licking
their
hurts
as
they
went
but
other
foes
were
near
for
as
beltane
reined
his
snorting
steed
about
he
swayed
in
his
stirrups
the
shock
of
a
bolt
that
glanced
whirring
from
his
bascinet
and
in
that
moment
sir
fidelis
cried
aloud
my
lord
my
lord
alas
my
poor
horse
is
glancing
round
beltane
beheld
sir
fidelis
slip
to
earth
as
his
charger
rearing
high
crashed
over
his
throat
transfixed
by
a
shaft
now
did
their
many
pursuers
shout
amain
fierce
and
joyful
goading
their
horses
to
swifter
pace
what
time
beltane
frowned
from
them
to
sir
fidelis
who
stood
mailed
hands
watching
beltane
eager
and
ah
cried
beltane
smiting
hand
to
thigh
in
bitter
anger
now
is
my
hope
of
ambush
and
surprise
like
to
be
marred
by
reason
of
thee
sir
knight
for
one
horse
may
never
carry
us
twain
why
then
i
can
die
here
my
lord
an
it
be
so
thy
will
spake
sir
fidelis
his
pale
lips
a
tremble
yet
is
thy
horse
strong
and
o
in
sooth
i
did
yearn
for
life
but
an
thou
wilt
give
me
death
come
cried
beltane
hoarsely
come
wherefore
tarry
ye
now
leapt
sir
fidelis
to
the
saddle
of
his
fallen
steed
and
snatched
thence
a
wallet
whereat
beltane
fell
for
bolts
and
arrows
began
to
whirr
and
hum
thick
and
fast
come
mount
sir
knight
mount
ye
up
behind
me
thy
hand
quick
thy
foot
on
my
foot
so
now
set
thy
two
arms
fast
about
me
and
see
thou
loose
me
not
for
now
must
we
ride
for
the
wild
brush
and
thicket
stock
and
stone
nought
must
let
or
stay
us
so
loose
me
not
sir
knight
ah
not
while
life
remain
messire
beltane
said
the
young
knight
and
speaking
took
beltane
within
two
mailed
arms
that
clasped
and
clung
full
close
then
wheeling
sharp
about
beltane
stooping
low
struck
sudden
spurs
and
they
plunged
crashing
into
the
denser
green
chapter
xli
how
they
rode
into
the
wilderness
fast
galloped
the
good
horse
bursting
through
underbrush
and
thicket
with
the
roar
of
the
pursuit
following
ever
distant
and
more
distant
and
ever
beltane
spurred
deeper
into
those
trackless
wilds
where
few
dare
adventure
them
by
reason
of
evil
spirits
that
do
haunt
these
solitudes
as
they
do
say
and
moreover
of
ravening
beasts
strongly
and
well
the
good
horse
bore
them
what
time
the
sun
waxed
fierce
and
hot
filling
the
woods
with
a
stifling
heat
a
close
windless
air
dank
and
heavy
with
the
scent
of
leaves
and
bracken
the
hue
and
cry
had
sunk
long
since
lost
in
distance
and
nought
broke
the
brooding
silence
but
the
stir
of
their
going
as
checking
their
headlong
pace
beltane
brought
the
powerful
animal
to
slow
and
leisured
gait
and
presently
a
gentle
wind
arose
that
came
and
went
to
fan
brow
and
cheek
and
temper
the
sun
heat
and
now
as
they
rode
through
sunlight
and
shadow
beltane
felt
his
black
mood
slowly
lifted
from
him
and
knew
a
sense
of
rest
a
content
unfelt
this
many
a
day
he
looked
upon
the
beauty
of
the
world
about
him
from
green
earth
to
an
azure
heaven
peeping
through
a
fretted
screen
of
branches
he
marked
the
graceful
slender
bracken
stirring
to
the
air
the
mighty
boles
of
stately
trees
that
reached
out
sinuous
boughs
one
to
another
to
touch
and
twine
together
amid
a
mystery
of
murmuring
leaves
all
this
he
saw
yet
heeded
not
at
all
the
arms
that
clasped
him
in
their
soft
embrace
nor
the
slender
hands
that
held
upon
his
girdle
so
rode
they
through
bosky
dell
and
dingle
until
the
sun
having
climbed
the
meridian
sank
slowly
westwards
and
sir
fidelis
spake
think
you
we
are
safe
at
last
my
lord
fidelis
saith
beltane
thou
name
me
selfish
a
babe
and
moreover
by
thy
disobedience
hast
made
my
schemes
of
no
avail
thus
am
i
wroth
with
thee
yet
doth
the
sun
shine
my
lord
said
sir
fidelis
small
of
voice
ha
think
you
my
anger
so
light
a
thing
forsooth
messire
i
think
of
it
not
at
all
by
thy
evil
conduct
are
we
fugitives
in
the
wilderness
yet
is
it
a
wondrous
fair
place
messire
and
we
unharmed
which
is
well
and
we
are
together
which
is
also
well
and
with
but
one
beast
to
bear
us
twain
yet
he
beareth
us
strong
and
nobly
messire
fidelis
i
would
i
had
seen
thee
thou
dost
not
see
me
now
lord
content
you
therefore
saith
fidelis
softly
whereat
beltane
must
needs
twist
in
the
saddle
yet
saw
no
more
than
a
mailed
arm
and
shoulder
howbeit
quoth
beltane
i
would
these
arms
o
thine
clasped
the
middle
of
any
other
man
than
i
forsooth
my
lord
and
do
they
crush
thee
so
or
is
it
thou
dost
pine
for
solitude
neither
youth
is
for
thy
youth
sake
for
though
thou
hast
angered
me
full
oft
art
but
a
very
youth
gramercy
for
my
so
much
youthfulness
my
lord
methinks
i
shall
be
full
long
old
heed
me
sir
knight
is
a
fell
place
this
where
direful
beasts
do
raven
nathless
messire
my
youthfulness
is
but
where
it
would
be
aye
forsooth
and
there
it
is
where
thou
be
thou
forsooth
art
indeed
a
wilful
youth
and
very
headstrong
and
wherefore
here
to
cheer
thee
in
thy
loneliness
my
lord
how
so
thou
shalt
reproach
me
for
my
youth
and
quarrel
with
me
when
thou
wilt
am
i
of
so
ill
humour
indeed
look
within
thyself
my
lord
now
here
they
rode
a
while
in
silence
but
presently
beltane
turned
him
again
in
the
saddle
and
saw
again
only
arm
and
shoulder
quoth
he
fidelis
art
a
strange
youth
and
a
valiant
and
yet
thy
voice
thy
voice
hath
betimes
a
a
something
i
love
not
a
note
of
softness
that
mindeth
me
of
bitter
days
then
heed
it
not
my
lord
is
but
that
i
grow
belike
here
silence
again
what
time
beltane
fell
to
frowning
and
sir
fidelis
head
to
watching
him
yet
with
lips
that
curved
to
wistful
smile
came
you
in
sooth
from
the
duchess
helen
fidelis
in
truth
my
lord
dost
love
her
also
aye
my
lord
also
then
alas
for
thee
poor
youthful
fool
better
i
had
left
thee
to
thy
death
methinks
for
she
this
wilful
helen
my
lord
cried
sir
fidelis
nought
will
i
hear
to
her
defame
fidelis
art
a
gentle
knight
but
very
young
art
fond
and
foolish
so
loving
this
light
lady
art
doubly
fool
wherein
saith
fidelis
wherein
my
lord
thou
art
likewise
fool
meseemeth
verily
nodded
beltane
o
verily
fool
am
i
yet
wise
in
this
that
i
do
know
my
folly
so
i
a
fool
would
counsel
thee
in
thy
folly
thus
give
not
thy
heart
to
helen
faithless
keeping
stoop
not
to
her
wanton
lure
ha
what
now
for
lithe
and
swift
sir
fidelis
had
sprung
to
earth
and
had
seized
the
great
roan
bridle
and
checking
him
in
his
stride
faced
beltane
with
cheeks
suffused
and
flaming
eyes
shame
messire
o
shame
he
cried
how
vile
is
he
that
would
with
lying
tongue
smirch
the
spotless
honour
of
any
maid
and
as
to
helen
i
do
name
thee
liar
liar
quarrel
with
me
in
matter
so
unworthy
enough
quoth
fidelis
unworthy
art
thou
to
take
her
name
within
thy
lips
enough
so
saying
sir
fidelis
stepped
back
a
pace
and
drew
his
sword
now
beltane
yet
astride
the
mighty
roan
that
snuffed
the
fragrant
air
and
stooped
to
crop
the
tender
herbage
looked
upon
the
youthful
paladin
wrinkled
brow
and
pulled
his
lip
as
one
in
doubt
anon
he
sighed
and
therewith
smiled
and
shook
his
head
quoth
he
o
fidelis
now
do
i
see
that
i
must
needs
love
thee
some
day
fidelis
art
a
fool
but
a
right
sweet
fool
so
do
i
humbly
sue
thy
foolish
pardon
and
as
to
helen
may
she
prove
worthy
thy
sweet
faith
and
i
thy
love
and
friendship
so
fair
knight
put
up
thy
sword
come
mount
and
let
us
on
sir
mars
methinks
doth
snuff
water
afar
and
i
do
yearn
me
for
the
cool
of
it
so
in
a
while
they
rode
on
again
yet
presently
sir
fidelis
preferred
a
sudden
question
thus
lord
fain
would
i
know
why
thou
dost
contemn
her
so
nay
sighed
beltane
here
is
a
tale
thy
tender
years
speak
we
of
other
things
as
thus
wherefore
didst
keep
our
lives
in
jeopardy
to
bring
away
the
wallet
that
cumbereth
thy
hip
for
that
within
doth
lie
first
our
supper
o
foolish
youth
these
woods
do
teem
with
food
a
neat
tongue
delicately
seasoned
o
said
beltane
manchets
of
fair
white
bread
ah
said
beltane
with
a
small
skin
of
rare
wine
enough
quoth
beltane
these
be
things
forsooth
worth
a
little
risk
now
do
i
thirst
and
famish
yet
knew
it
not
an
thou
wilt
eat
my
lord
nay
first
will
we
find
some
freshet
where
we
may
bathe
awhile
ha
to
plunge
naked
within
some
sweet
pool
is
a
sweet
thought
fidelis
but
hereupon
the
young
knight
made
answer
none
and
fell
into
a
reverie
and
beltane
also
what
time
they
rode
by
murmuring
rills
through
swampy
hollows
past
brake
and
briar
until
as
evening
began
to
fall
they
came
unto
a
broad
stream
whose
waters
aglow
with
sunset
glory
split
asunder
the
greeny
gloom
of
trees
most
pleasant
to
behold
then
sighing
for
very
gladness
beltane
checked
his
horse
and
spake
right
gleefully
light
down
light
down
good
fidelis
saw
i
fairer
haven
for
wearied
travellers
we
have
ridden
hard
and
far
so
here
will
we
tarry
the
night
and
down
to
earth
he
sprang
to
stride
up
and
down
and
stretch
his
cramped
limbs
the
while
sir
fidelis
loosing
off
the
great
saddle
led
the
down
to
the
water
now
because
of
the
heat
beltane
laid
by
his
bascinet
and
hearkening
to
the
soft
cool
ripple
of
the
water
he
straightway
unbuckled
his
and
began
to
doff
his
heavy
hauberk
perceiving
the
which
cometh
sir
fidelis
to
him
something
hastily
what
do
you
messire
he
questioned
do
fidelis
forsooth
i
would
bathe
me
in
yon
cool
sweet
water
list
how
it
murmureth
the
bank
yonder
come
then
strip
as
i
do
youth
strip
and
let
us
swim
together
pray
you
aid
me
with
this
lacing
my
lord
i
indeed
i
do
think
it
unsafe
unsafe
boy
an
our
foes
should
come
upon
us
o
content
you
quoth
beltane
stooping
to
loose
off
his
spurs
our
foes
were
lost
hours
since
nor
shall
any
find
us
here
in
the
wild
methinks
pray
you
loose
me
this
buckle
come
list
how
the
waters
do
woo
us
with
their
pretty
babble
but
messire
quoth
fidelis
and
fumbling
awkwardly
with
the
buckle
indeed
i
i
have
no
art
in
swimming
then
will
i
teach
thee
nay
spake
the
young
knight
hastily
his
trouble
growing
i
do
dread
the
water
well
there
be
shallows
the
alders
yonder
aye
but
the
shallows
will
be
muddy
and
i
muddy
cried
beltane
pausing
with
his
hauberk
half
on
half
off
to
stare
at
sir
fidelis
in
amaze
muddy
forsooth
art
a
dainty
youth
in
faith
and
methinks
what
matter
for
a
little
honest
mud
prithee
why
is
mud
and
slimy
under
foot
and
i
love
not
mud
so
will
i
none
of
the
shallows
then
verily
must
i
chide
thee
fidelis
for
then
verily
will
i
unto
yon
boskage
messire
to
prepare
us
a
fire
the
that
raven
and
our
bracken
beds
howbeit
bathe
me
i
will
not
messire
o
luxurious
youth
then
will
i
and
shame
thy
nice
luxuriousness
quoth
beltane
and
off
came
hauberk
and
quilted
gambeson
and
away
skipped
sir
fidelis
into
the
green
so
presently
beltane
plunged
him
into
the
stream
and
swimming
with
powerful
strokes
felt
his
youth
and
strength
redoubled
thereby
and
rejoiced
to
be
alive
thereafter
he
leapt
ashore
his
blood
aglow
with
ardent
life
and
as
he
clothed
him
felt
a
great
and
mighty
hunger
but
scarce
had
he
donned
chausses
and
gambeson
than
he
heard
an
outcry
and
sudden
clamour
within
the
green
whereupon
staying
not
for
his
armour
he
caught
up
his
sword
and
unsheathing
it
as
he
ran
plunged
in
among
the
trees
and
there
espied
sir
fidelis
stoutly
withstanding
three
foul
knaves
unwashed
and
ragged
then
shouted
beltane
and
fell
upon
them
right
joyously
and
smote
them
gleefully
and
laughed
to
see
them
reel
and
scatter
before
his
sudden
onset
whereon
beholding
sir
fidelis
pale
and
scant
of
breath
he
stayed
to
clap
him
on
the
shoulder
blithely
done
good
fidelis
quoth
he
rest
thee
awhile
and
catch
thy
wind
for
fain
am
i
to
try
a
bout
with
yon
tall
rogues
so
saying
he
advanced
upon
the
scowling
three
his
eyes
his
nimble
feet
for
swift
action
for
lusty
rogues
were
these
who
seeing
him
alone
forthwith
met
him
point
and
edge
besetting
him
with
many
swashing
blows
that
whistling
did
but
cleave
the
empty
air
or
rang
loud
upon
his
blade
so
hewed
they
and
smote
amain
until
their
brows
shone
moist
and
their
breaths
waxed
short
whereat
beltane
mocked
them
saying
ha
sweat
ye
forsooth
do
ye
puff
so
soon
this
cometh
of
foul
eating
and
fouler
life
off
off
ye
beefy
an
ye
would
be
worthy
fighters
eat
less
and
bathe
ye
more
then
beltane
laid
on
with
the
flat
of
his
heavy
sword
and
soundly
belaboured
these
knaves
insomuch
that
one
on
the
crown
stumbled
and
fell
whereupon
his
comrades
to
save
their
bones
leapt
forthwith
the
steepy
bank
and
plunging
into
the
stream
made
across
to
the
farther
side
splashing
prodigiously
and
cursing
consumedly
for
the
water
they
liked
not
at
all
now
as
beltane
leaned
him
on
his
sword
watching
their
flounderings
the
weapon
was
dashed
from
his
loosened
hold
he
staggered
the
bite
of
vicious
steel
and
starting
round
beheld
the
third
rogue
his
deadly
sword
swung
high
but
even
as
the
blow
fell
sir
fidelis
sprang
between
and
took
it
upon
his
own
slender
body
and
staggering
aside
fell
and
lay
with
arms
then
whiles
the
robber
yet
stared
upon
his
sword
shivered
by
the
blow
beltane
leapt
and
ere
he
could
flee
caught
him
about
the
loins
and
whirling
him
aloft
dashed
him
out
into
the
stream
then
kneeling
by
sir
fidelis
he
took
his
heavy
head
upon
his
arm
and
beheld
his
cheeks
pale
and
wan
his
eyes
fast
shut
and
saw
his
shining
bascinet
scored
and
by
the
blow
fidelis
he
groaned
o
my
brave
fidelis
and
art
thou
slain
for
my
sake
but
in
a
while
what
time
beltane
kneeled
and
mourned
over
him
full
sore
the
young
knight
stirred
feebly
sighed
and
spake
beltane
he
whispered
and
again
beltane
anon
his
white
lids
quivered
and
opening
swooning
eyes
he
spake
again
with
voice
grown
stronger
my
lord
my
lord
what
of
thy
wound
and
lo
the
voice
was
sweet
to
hear
as
note
of
merle
or
mavis
these
eyes
were
long
and
deeply
blue
beneath
their
heavy
lashes
eyes
that
looked
up
brimful
of
tenderness
ere
they
closed
slow
and
wearily
eyes
so
much
at
odds
with
grim
bascinet
and
camail
that
beltane
must
needs
start
and
hold
his
breath
and
fall
to
sudden
trembling
what
time
sir
fidelis
lay
there
pale
and
motionless
as
one
that
is
dead
now
great
fear
came
upon
beltane
and
he
would
have
uttered
desperate
prayers
but
could
not
trembling
yet
full
gently
he
drew
his
arm
from
under
that
drooping
head
and
stealing
to
the
river
marge
stood
there
staring
down
at
the
rippling
waters
and
his
heart
was
rent
with
conflicting
passions
amazement
fear
anger
joy
and
a
black
despair
and
of
a
sudden
beltane
fell
upon
his
knees
and
bowed
him
low
and
lower
until
his
burning
brow
was
hid
in
the
cool
sweet
grass
for
of
these
passions
fiercest
strongest
wildest
was
despair
chapter
xlii
how
beltane
dreamed
in
the
now
in
a
while
he
started
to
feel
a
hand
among
his
hair
and
the
hand
was
wondrous
light
and
very
gentle
wherefore
wondering
he
raised
his
head
but
behold
the
sun
was
gone
and
the
shadows
deepening
to
night
yet
even
so
he
stared
and
thrilled
wonder
and
fear
to
see
sir
fidelis
bending
over
him
fidelis
he
murmured
and
is
it
thee
in
truth
or
do
i
dream
dear
my
lord
is
i
indeed
how
long
hast
lain
thus
i
did
but
now
wake
from
my
swoon
is
it
thy
hurt
suffer
me
to
look
nay
is
of
none
account
but
i
did
dream
thee
dead
fidelis
ah
messire
thy
hurt
bleedeth
apace
the
steel
hath
gone
deep
sit
you
thus
thy
back
against
the
tree
so
within
my
wallet
i
have
a
salve
wait
you
here
so
whiles
beltane
stared
dreamily
upon
the
twilit
river
sir
fidelis
hasted
up
the
bank
and
was
back
again
the
wallet
by
his
side
whence
he
took
a
phial
and
goblet
and
mixed
therein
a
draught
which
dreamy
beltane
perforce
must
swallow
and
thereafter
the
dreamy
languor
fell
from
him
what
time
sir
fidelis
fell
to
bathing
and
bandaging
the
ugly
gash
that
showed
beneath
his
knee
now
as
he
watched
these
busy
skilful
fingers
he
knew
a
sudden
uneasy
qualm
and
forthwith
spake
his
thought
aloud
thy
hands
are
wondrous
small
and
slender
sir
fidelis
belike
messire
they
shall
grow
bigger
some
day
yet
are
they
wondrous
fair
and
soft
and
white
fidelis
mayhap
messire
they
shall
grow
rough
and
brown
and
hairy
anon
so
content
you
yet
wherefore
are
they
so
soft
fidelis
and
so
and
wherefore
see
you
my
lord
thus
must
the
bandage
lie
so
nor
must
it
slacken
lest
the
bleeding
start
afresh
so
saying
sir
fidelis
arose
and
taking
the
wallet
in
one
hand
and
setting
the
other
beltane
arm
led
him
to
where
under
screening
willows
a
fire
burned
cheerily
whereby
were
two
beds
of
scented
bracken
dark
and
darker
the
shadows
crept
down
deepening
to
a
night
soft
and
warm
and
very
still
whose
quietude
was
unbroken
save
for
the
drowsy
lap
and
murmur
of
the
river
and
the
sound
the
mars
made
as
he
cropped
the
grass
near
by
full
of
a
languorous
content
lay
beltane
despite
the
smarting
of
his
wound
what
time
sir
fidelis
came
and
went
about
the
fire
and
there
within
this
great
and
silent
wilderness
they
supped
together
and
while
they
supped
beltane
looked
oft
upon
sir
fidelis
heedful
of
every
trick
of
feature
and
gesture
of
graceful
hand
as
he
had
been
ere
now
wherefore
sir
fidelis
grew
red
grew
pale
was
by
turns
talkative
and
silent
and
was
fain
to
withdraw
into
the
shadows
beyond
the
fire
and
from
there
seeing
beltane
silent
and
full
of
thought
grew
bold
to
question
him
dost
meditate
our
course
my
lord
beltane
nay
i
do
but
think
a
strange
thought
that
i
have
seen
thy
face
ere
now
fidelis
yet
art
full
young
to
bear
arms
doth
my
youth
plague
thee
still
messire
believe
me
i
am
older
than
i
seem
thou
at
peril
of
thy
life
fidelis
didst
leap
me
and
death
so
needs
must
i
know
thee
for
my
friend
and
yet
and
yet
messire
thou
hast
betimes
the
look
and
speech
of
one
of
one
beyond
all
traitors
vile
ah
murmured
sir
fidelis
a
sudden
tremor
in
his
voice
thou
dost
mean
helen
of
mortain
poor
fidelis
whom
thou
dost
love
whom
thou
dost
hate
beltane
and
o
i
pray
thee
wherefore
is
thy
hate
so
bitter
fidelis
there
lived
a
fool
that
for
her
beauty
loved
her
with
a
mighty
love
that
for
her
seeming
truth
and
purity
honoured
her
beyond
all
things
that
in
the
end
did
find
her
beyond
all
things
vile
aye
there
lived
a
fool
and
i
am
he
ah
beseech
thee
cried
sir
fidelis
white
hands
outstretched
how
know
you
her
thus
false
to
thee
beltane
know
then
sir
fidelis
that
upon
our
i
was
by
her
command
struck
down
within
the
chapel
upon
the
very
altar
and
by
her
borne
in
bonds
unto
garthlaxton
keep
a
present
to
mine
enemy
duke
ivo
o
is
a
lie
o
dear
my
lord
is
lie
most
foul
in
witness
whereof
behold
upon
my
wrists
the
shameful
irons
from
my
dungeon
alas
here
was
no
work
of
helen
no
thought
no
will
helen
would
have
died
to
save
thee
this
so
fidelis
do
i
scorn
all
women
that
do
live
upon
this
earth
henceforth
but
above
all
helen
the
beautiful
the
wilful
who
in
her
white
bosom
doth
bear
a
heart
more
foul
than
trojan
helen
that
was
a
woman
false
and
damned
so
now
all
said
now
fell
sir
fidelis
upon
his
knees
and
spake
quick
and
passionate
nay
beltane
hear
me
for
now
do
i
swear
that
he
who
told
thee
was
helen
wrought
thee
this
vile
wrong
who
told
thee
this
doth
lie
o
doth
lie
now
do
i
swear
that
never
by
word
or
thought
or
deed
hath
she
been
false
to
thee
i
do
swear
she
loveth
thee
ah
spurn
me
not
o
believe
enough
enough
good
fidelis
perjure
not
thy
sweet
youth
for
one
so
much
unworthy
for
with
these
eyes
did
i
behold
her
as
they
bore
me
in
my
bonds
and
shall
i
not
believe
mine
eyes
never
ah
never
when
they
do
shew
thee
helen
false
and
cruel
to
thee
here
was
some
vile
magic
witchcraft
enough
fidelis
is
past
and
done
here
was
a
woman
false
well
none
so
singular
there
have
been
others
there
will
be
others
so
god
keep
thee
sweet
youth
from
the
ways
of
women
nay
let
us
speak
of
this
no
more
for
in
sooth
i
grow
and
we
must
ride
with
the
dawn
so
betake
thee
to
thy
rest
nor
grieve
thee
for
my
sorrows
past
and
done
mayhap
they
shall
be
things
to
smile
upon
one
day
so
saying
beltane
sighed
and
laid
him
down
among
the
bracken
and
thereafter
fidelis
did
the
like
the
fire
sank
and
waned
and
oft
sir
fidelis
stirred
restless
in
the
shadows
the
river
murmured
slumberously
among
the
sedge
but
beltane
hearkening
with
drowsy
ears
oft
thought
to
hear
another
sound
very
soft
and
repressed
yet
very
dolorous
ere
worn
and
spent
and
something
weakened
by
wound
and
loss
of
blood
he
sank
at
last
to
deep
and
gentle
sleep
but
in
his
sleep
he
dreamed
that
one
knelt
above
him
in
the
dark
keeping
watch
upon
his
slumbers
in
the
attitude
of
one
in
prayer
one
whom
he
knew
yet
knew
not
it
seemed
to
beltane
in
his
dream
that
this
silent
slender
shape
stooped
of
a
sudden
low
and
lower
to
kiss
the
iron
fetters
that
bound
his
wrists
then
beltane
strove
to
wake
yet
could
not
wake
but
in
his
slumber
sighed
a
name
and
gentle
as
the
languorous
murmur
of
the
stream
helen
chapter
xliii
how
beltane
knew
great
humility
the
rising
sun
darting
an
inquisitive
beam
a
leafy
opening
fell
upon
beltane
wide
breast
crept
upwards
to
his
chin
his
cheek
and
finally
strove
to
peep
beneath
his
slumberous
lids
whereat
beltane
stirred
yawned
threw
wide
and
stretched
his
mighty
arms
and
thereafter
blinking
drowsily
sat
up
his
golden
hair
and
stared
sleepily
about
him
birds
piped
joyously
near
and
far
hid
among
the
leaves
near
by
the
mars
stamped
eager
hoof
and
snuffed
the
fragrant
air
of
morning
but
sir
fidelis
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
thus
in
a
while
beltane
arose
to
find
his
leg
very
stiff
and
sore
and
his
throat
be
parched
with
feverish
thirst
wherefore
limping
painfully
he
turned
where
a
little
went
singing
pebbly
bed
to
join
the
river
but
putting
aside
the
leaves
he
paused
of
a
sudden
for
there
beside
the
noisy
streamlet
he
beheld
sir
fidelis
his
bascinet
upon
the
grass
beside
him
his
thrown
back
betwixt
his
shoulders
stooping
to
bathe
his
face
in
the
sparkling
water
now
would
he
have
called
a
greeting
but
the
words
died
upon
his
lips
his
breath
stayed
and
he
stared
at
something
that
had
caught
in
the
links
of
the
young
knight
something
that
stirred
light
and
wanton
kissed
by
the
breath
of
early
morn
a
lock
of
bright
hair
that
glowed
a
wondrous
in
the
sun
so
stood
beltane
awhile
and
beholding
this
a
trembling
seized
him
and
therewith
sudden
anger
and
he
strode
forth
of
the
leaves
and
lo
on
the
instant
on
went
hood
of
mail
and
thereafter
shining
bascinet
and
sir
fidelis
arose
but
ere
he
could
turn
beltane
was
beside
him
had
caught
him
within
a
powerful
arm
and
setting
a
hand
mailed
chin
lifted
the
young
knight
head
and
scowled
down
into
his
face
eyes
long
and
darkly
blue
that
looked
up
awhile
into
his
wide
yet
fearless
and
anon
were
hid
lids
a
nose
tenderly
aquiline
lips
red
and
full
that
met
in
ripe
and
luscious
curves
this
beltane
saw
and
straightway
his
anger
grew
ah
cried
he
hoarsely
now
by
the
living
god
who
art
thou
and
what
thy
lord
beltane
why
hast
thou
the
seeming
of
one
beyond
all
women
false
why
dost
thou
speak
me
betimes
in
her
voice
look
at
me
with
her
eyes
touch
me
with
her
soft
white
traitor
hands
answer
me
my
lord
we
are
akin
she
and
i
of
the
same
house
and
blood
then
is
thy
blood
foul
with
treachery
yet
did
i
save
thy
life
beltane
yet
thy
soft
voice
thy
red
mouth
and
false
eyes
thy
very
blood
all
these
do
prove
thee
traitor
hence
and
beltane
threw
him
off
nay
my
lord
he
cried
prithee
take
care
beltane
see
thou
hast
displaced
the
bandage
thy
wound
bleedeth
amain
so
will
i
bind
it
up
for
thee
but
beltane
nothing
heeding
turned
and
strode
back
into
the
green
and
there
fell
to
donning
his
armour
as
swiftly
as
he
might
albeit
stealthily
thereafter
came
he
to
the
destrier
mars
and
having
saddled
and
bridled
him
with
the
same
swift
stealth
set
foot
in
stirrup
and
would
have
mounted
yet
found
this
a
painful
matter
by
reason
of
his
wound
thus
it
befell
that
ere
he
could
reach
the
saddle
the
leaves
parted
close
by
and
sir
fidelis
spake
my
lord
beltane
why
dost
thou
steal
away
thus
an
it
be
thy
will
to
leave
me
to
perish
alone
here
in
the
wilderness
first
break
thy
fast
and
suffer
me
to
bind
up
thy
hurt
so
shalt
thou
ride
hence
in
comfort
now
stood
beltane
motionless
and
silent
nor
turned
nor
dared
he
look
upon
sir
fidelis
but
bowed
his
head
in
bitter
shame
and
therewith
knew
a
great
remorse
ah
fidelis
said
he
at
last
thy
rebuke
stingeth
deep
for
it
is
just
since
i
indeed
did
purpose
thee
a
most
vile
thing
how
vile
a
thing
then
am
i
nay
beltane
dear
my
lord
i
would
not
have
thee
grieve
indeed
was
but
once
ere
this
i
would
have
slain
thee
fidelis
murdered
thee
before
my
wild
fellows
i
i
that
did
preach
them
mercy
and
gentleness
i
would
have
left
thee
to
perish
alone
within
this
ravening
wilderness
that
do
bear
so
honourable
a
name
o
beltane
my
father
yet
believe
me
i
did
love
honour
once
and
was
accounted
gentle
i
did
set
forth
to
do
great
things
but
now
now
do
i
know
myself
unfit
and
most
unworthy
therefore
sir
fidelis
do
thou
take
the
horse
and
what
thou
wilt
beside
and
leave
me
here
for
fain
am
i
to
end
my
days
within
these
solitudes
with
no
eye
to
see
me
more
save
only
the
eye
of
god
so
saying
beltane
went
aside
and
sitting
a
tree
beside
the
river
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
groaned
then
came
sir
fidelis
full
swift
and
stooping
touched
his
bowed
head
with
gentle
hand
whereat
he
but
groaned
again
god
pity
me
quoth
he
i
am
in
sooth
so
changed
meseemeth
some
vile
demon
doth
possess
me
betimes
and
sighing
deep
he
gazed
upon
the
rippling
waters
and
fearful
and
as
he
sat
thus
abashed
and
despairing
sir
fidelis
speaking
no
word
bathed
and
bound
up
his
wound
and
thereafter
brought
and
spread
forth
their
remaining
viands
eat
said
he
gently
come
let
us
break
our
fast
mayhap
thy
sorrows
shall
grow
less
anon
come
eat
i
pray
thee
beltane
for
none
will
i
eat
alone
and
o
i
famish
so
they
ate
together
whiles
the
mars
pawing
impatient
hoof
oft
turned
his
great
head
to
view
them
with
round
and
wistful
eye
fidelis
quoth
beltane
suddenly
thou
didst
name
me
selfish
and
verily
a
selfish
man
am
i
and
o
fidelis
why
dost
not
reproach
me
for
the
evil
i
purposed
thee
for
that
i
do
most
truly
love
thee
beltane
my
lord
yet
wherefore
did
ye
so
yesterday
and
for
lesser
fault
for
that
i
did
love
thee
so
would
i
see
thee
a
strong
man
yet
gentle
a
potent
lord
yet
humble
a
noble
man
as
as
thou
wert
said
to
be
alas
my
fidelis
harsh
have
i
been
proud
and
unforgiving
aye
my
lord
thou
art
unforgiving
a
little
so
now
fidelis
would
i
crave
forgiveness
of
all
men
then
came
the
young
knight
nearer
yet
his
face
radiant
with
sudden
joy
his
white
hands
clasped
lord
he
whispered
o
beltane
indeed
forgive
all
all
harm
done
thee
howsoever
great
or
small
thy
mind
doth
hold
them
forgive
all
aye
i
could
forgive
them
all
fidelis
all
save
helen
who
hath
broke
this
heart
of
mine
and
made
my
soul
a
thing
as
black
as
she
hath
whited
this
my
hair
now
of
a
sudden
beltane
heard
a
sound
a
small
sound
a
sob
and
a
moan
but
when
he
raised
his
heavy
head
lo
sir
fidelis
was
gone
chapter
xliv
how
a
madness
came
upon
beltane
in
the
the
sun
rose
high
jet
still
beltane
sat
there
beside
the
stream
staring
down
into
the
gurgling
waters
grieving
amain
for
his
unworthiness
thus
presently
comes
sir
fidelis
and
standing
afar
spake
in
voice
strange
and
bitter
what
do
ye
there
my
lord
dost
dream
ever
upon
thy
woes
and
ills
wilt
dream
thy
life
away
here
amid
the
wild
forsooth
quoth
beltane
very
humbly
and
wherefore
not
sir
fidelis
unfit
am
i
for
great
achievements
but
as
to
thee
take
now
the
horse
and
ride
you
ever
north
and
west
yea
but
where
is
north
and
where
west
the
trees
shall
tell
you
this
hearken
now
nay
my
lord
no
forester
am
i
to
find
my
way
through
trackless
wild
so
an
thou
stay
so
perforce
must
i
and
if
thou
stay
then
art
thou
deeply
forsworn
how
mean
you
good
sir
i
mean
belsaye
i
mean
all
those
brave
souls
that
do
wait
and
watch
ivo
threatened
vengeance
ha
belsaye
quoth
beltane
lifting
his
head
thou
must
save
belsaye
from
flame
and
ravishment
my
lord
aye
forsooth
cried
beltane
clenching
his
hands
though
i
be
unworthy
to
stand
in
my
noble
father
place
yet
belsaye
must
be
saved
or
i
die
in
it
o
fidelis
friend
art
thou
indeed
and
wise
beyond
thy
years
but
as
beltane
arose
sir
fidelis
incontinent
turned
away
and
presently
came
back
leading
the
great
horse
so
in
a
while
they
set
out
northwards
but
now
were
no
arms
to
clasp
and
cling
since
sir
fidelis
found
hold
otherwhere
thus
after
some
going
beltane
questioned
him
art
easy
fidelis
aye
lord
wilt
not
take
hold
upon
my
belt
as
yesterday
methinks
i
am
better
thus
nay
then
shalt
have
stirrups
and
saddle
for
i
am
fain
to
walk
and
thy
wound
messire
nay
let
be
i
ride
easily
thus
art
angered
with
me
fidelis
nay
lord
i
do
but
pity
thee
and
wherefore
for
thy
so
great
loneliness
in
all
thy
world
is
none
but
beltane
and
he
is
very
woeful
and
dreameth
ever
of
his
wrongs
call
me
selfish
again
forsooth
nay
lord
a
martyr
o
a
very
martyr
that
huggeth
his
chains
and
kisseth
his
wounds
and
joyeth
in
the
recollection
of
his
pain
have
i
not
suffered
fidelis
thou
hast
known
the
jangling
gloom
of
a
dungeon
was
at
garthlaxton
keep
methinks
fetters
cried
beltane
a
dungeon
these
be
things
to
smile
at
my
grief
is
of
the
mind
the
deeper
woe
of
high
and
noble
ideals
shattered
a
holy
altar
blackened
and
profaned
a
woman
worshipped
as
divine
and
proved
baser
than
the
basest
and
is
this
all
my
lord
all
quoth
beltane
amazed
all
saith
he
turning
to
stare
so
much
of
woe
and
tribulation
for
so
little
reason
nay
hear
me
for
now
will
i
make
thee
a
prophecy
as
thus
there
shall
dawn
a
day
lord
beltane
when
thou
shalt
see
at
last
and
know
truth
when
she
stands
before
thee
and
in
that
day
thou
shalt
behold
all
things
with
new
eyes
and
in
that
day
shalt
thou
sigh
and
long
and
yearn
with
all
thy
soul
for
these
woeful
hours
wherein
self
looms
for
thee
so
large
thou
art
blind
to
aught
else
good
fidelis
thy
prophecy
is
beyond
my
understanding
aye
my
lord
is
so
i
think
indeed
pray
thee
therefore
rede
and
expound
it
unto
me
nay
time
mayhap
shall
teach
it
thee
and
thou
methinks
shalt
passionately
desire
again
the
solitude
of
this
wilderness
aye
but
wherefore
for
that
it
shall
be
beyond
thy
reach
and
mine
and
fidelis
sighed
in
deep
and
troubled
fashion
and
so
fell
to
silence
what
time
beltane
cunning
in
glancing
hither
and
thither
at
knotted
branch
and
writhen
tree
bole
viewing
earth
and
heaven
with
a
forester
quick
eye
rode
on
into
the
trackless
wilds
of
the
now
here
thinketh
the
historian
it
booteth
not
to
tell
of
all
those
minor
haps
and
chances
that
befell
them
how
despite
all
they
went
astray
full
oft
by
reason
of
fordless
rivers
and
quaking
swamps
of
how
they
snared
game
to
their
sustenance
or
how
for
all
the
care
and
skill
of
sir
fidelis
beltane
wound
healed
not
by
reason
of
continual
riding
for
that
each
day
he
grew
more
restless
and
eager
for
knowledge
of
belsaye
so
that
because
of
his
wound
he
knew
small
rest
by
day
and
a
fevered
sleep
by
night
yet
despite
all
his
love
for
fidelis
daily
waxed
and
grew
what
time
he
pressed
on
through
the
wild
country
five
weary
days
and
nights
wandered
they
lost
to
sight
and
knowledge
within
the
wild
days
of
heat
and
nights
of
pain
and
travail
until
there
came
an
evening
when
racked
with
anguish
and
faint
with
thirst
and
weariness
beltane
drew
rein
within
a
place
of
rocks
whereby
was
a
shady
pool
in
trees
down
sprang
fidelis
to
look
anxiously
on
beltane
face
pale
and
haggard
in
the
light
of
a
great
moon
says
beltane
looking
round
about
with
knitted
brow
fidelis
o
fidelis
methinks
i
know
this
place
these
rocks
the
pool
yonder
there
should
be
a
road
hereabout
the
great
road
that
leadeth
to
mortain
climb
now
the
steep
and
tell
me
an
you
can
see
a
road
running
north
and
south
forthwith
sir
fidelis
climbed
the
rocky
eminence
and
being
there
cried
right
joyously
aye
lord
is
the
road
the
road
and
so
came
hastily
down
is
the
end
of
this
wilderness
at
last
my
lord
aye
sighed
beltane
at
last
and
groaning
he
swayed
in
the
saddle
for
his
pain
was
very
sore
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
ready
arms
of
sir
fidelis
thereafter
with
much
labour
beltane
got
him
to
earth
and
fidelis
brought
him
where
beneath
the
steep
was
a
shallow
cave
carpeted
with
soft
moss
very
excellent
suited
to
their
need
here
beltane
laid
him
down
watching
a
little
cataract
that
rippled
the
rocky
bank
near
by
where
ferns
and
lichens
grew
what
time
sir
fidelis
came
and
went
and
having
set
fire
whereby
to
cook
their
supper
brought
an
armful
of
fragrant
heather
to
set
beltane
weary
head
then
having
given
him
to
drink
of
the
cordial
fell
to
work
bathing
and
bandaging
his
wound
sighing
often
to
see
it
so
swollen
and
angry
fidelis
quoth
beltane
methinks
there
is
some
magic
in
thy
touch
for
now
is
my
pain
abated
hast
a
wondrous
gentle
hand
is
the
cordial
giveth
thee
respite
lord
nay
is
thy
hand
methinks
sure
no
man
was
blest
with
truer
friend
than
thou
my
fidelis
brave
art
thou
yet
tender
as
any
woman
and
rather
would
i
have
thy
love
than
the
love
of
any
man
or
woman
soever
henceforth
dear
my
friend
nay
wherefore
hang
thy
head
without
thee
i
had
died
many
times
ere
this
without
thy
voice
to
cheer
me
in
these
solitudes
thy
strength
and
skill
to
aid
me
i
had
fallen
into
madness
and
death
wherefore
i
do
love
thee
fidelis
and
fain
would
have
thee
go
beside
me
ever
so
great
is
become
my
need
of
thee
ah
beltane
thou
dost
know
i
will
desert
thee
so
henceforth
am
i
content
and
yet
well
my
lord
perchance
shall
see
the
end
of
this
our
solitude
and
close
comradeship
we
should
reach
hundleby
fen
so
fidelis
promise
me
if
thou
at
any
time
hereafter
should
see
me
harsh
or
proud
or
selfish
do
thou
mind
me
of
these
days
of
our
love
and
companionship
wilt
promise
me
aye
lord
spake
sir
fidelis
to
his
task
and
thereafter
sighed
and
bowed
him
lower
yet
wherefore
dost
thou
sigh
for
that
i
feel
as
if
ah
beltane
as
if
this
night
should
be
the
end
of
our
love
and
comradeship
nought
but
death
shall
do
this
methinks
why
then
said
fidelis
as
he
rose
an
it
must
be
fain
would
i
have
death
but
when
beltane
would
have
questioned
him
further
he
smiled
sad
and
wistful
and
went
forth
to
the
fire
up
rose
the
moon
a
thing
of
glory
filling
the
warm
stilly
night
with
a
soft
and
radiant
splendour
a
tender
light
fraught
with
a
subtle
magic
whereby
all
things
rock
and
tree
and
leaping
brook
found
a
new
and
added
beauty
and
in
some
while
comes
sir
fidelis
to
set
out
their
viands
neat
and
orderly
as
was
ever
his
custom
and
thereafter
must
needs
chide
beltane
for
his
lack
of
hunger
and
cut
dainty
morsels
wooing
him
thereby
to
eat
fidelis
says
beltane
on
so
fair
a
night
as
this
methinks
the
old
fables
and
romances
might
well
be
true
that
tell
of
elves
that
dance
on
moony
nights
and
of
shapely
nymphs
and
lovely
dryads
that
are
the
spirits
of
the
trees
aye
in
the
magic
of
so
fair
a
night
as
this
aught
might
happen
miracles
and
wonders
save
one
thing
dear
my
lord
as
what
my
fidelis
that
thou
dream
helen
pure
and
faithful
and
worthy
to
thy
love
that
doubting
thine
own
senses
thou
yearn
and
sigh
to
hold
her
once
again
heart
on
heart
ah
fidelis
quoth
beltane
sighing
deep
why
wilt
thou
awake
a
sleeping
sorrow
my
love
was
dead
long
since
meseemeth
and
buried
in
mine
heart
o
fidelis
mine
eyes
mine
ears
my
every
sense
do
tell
me
she
is
false
so
is
an
end
of
love
for
me
henceforth
dear
my
lord
spake
fidelis
and
his
voice
thrilled
strangely
in
beltane
ears
o
beltane
my
lord
thou
but
doubt
thyself
a
little
thou
doubting
thine
own
senses
for
love
sake
believe
her
now
true
true
as
thou
have
her
then
love
indeed
might
work
for
thee
a
miracle
this
night
and
thou
be
loved
as
man
of
faith
nay
sweet
fidelis
i
am
but
a
man
apt
to
evil
betimes
and
betimes
seeking
good
howbeit
now
am
i
a
weary
man
that
fain
would
sleep
come
then
lay
you
down
here
beside
me
where
i
may
touch
thee
an
i
awake
the
night
and
lying
down
beltane
beckoned
fidelis
beside
him
so
in
a
while
the
young
knight
came
and
did
as
beltane
bade
and
side
by
side
they
lay
within
the
shelter
of
the
little
cave
and
in
the
dark
beltane
set
his
mighty
arm
about
him
and
thereafter
spake
wondering
art
not
cold
fidelis
nay
lord
then
why
dost
tremble
indeed
i
know
not
mayhap
i
grieved
that
the
age
of
miracles
is
passed
away
now
at
this
beltane
wondered
the
more
and
would
fain
have
questioned
him
but
in
that
moment
sighed
and
fell
to
slumber
but
in
his
sleep
he
dreamed
that
fidelis
was
beset
by
foes
and
cried
to
him
for
aid
whereon
he
would
have
hasted
to
his
deliverance
yet
could
not
for
that
unseen
hands
held
him
fast
then
strove
he
amain
against
these
griping
hands
and
so
awaked
in
sudden
terror
and
lay
there
trembling
in
the
dark
and
in
the
dark
he
reached
out
cautious
hand
further
and
further
and
so
found
himself
alone
for
the
young
knight
was
gone
now
being
very
sick
with
the
fever
of
his
wound
dread
came
upon
him
fear
seized
and
shook
him
and
trembling
in
the
dark
he
called
aloud
fidelis
fidelis
but
no
sound
heard
he
save
the
ripple
of
the
brook
near
by
groaning
he
arose
and
limping
forth
of
the
cave
stood
in
the
glory
of
the
moon
voiceless
now
by
reason
of
his
terror
conscious
only
of
his
passionate
desire
to
find
again
the
youth
whose
gentle
voice
had
cheered
him
often
in
the
dark
whose
high
courage
and
tender
care
had
never
failed
so
leaning
upon
his
great
sword
beltane
limped
through
light
and
shadow
heedless
of
direction
until
he
was
stayed
by
the
waters
of
the
pool
a
faint
splash
a
rippling
of
the
sleepy
waters
and
out
into
the
moonlight
came
one
that
swam
the
pool
with
long
easy
strokes
one
that
presently
leapt
lightly
ashore
and
stood
there
to
shake
down
the
unwetted
glory
of
her
hair
at
first
he
thought
this
some
enchanted
pool
and
she
the
goddess
of
the
place
but
even
then
she
turned
and
thus
at
last
he
knew
and
in
that
moment
also
she
beheld
him
amid
the
leaves
tall
and
fair
she
stood
proud
and
maidenly
nor
moved
she
nor
spake
only
she
shook
about
her
loveliness
the
shining
mantle
of
her
hair
and
beholding
the
reproachful
sadness
of
those
clear
virgin
eyes
beltane
abashed
by
her
very
beauty
bowed
his
head
and
turning
stumbled
away
and
thus
presently
finding
himself
within
the
cave
threw
himself
down
and
clasped
his
head
within
fierce
hands
yet
even
so
needs
must
he
behold
the
slim
white
beauty
of
her
the
rippling
splendour
of
her
hair
and
the
deep
shy
sadness
of
her
eyes
and
because
of
her
beauty
he
trembled
and
because
of
her
falsity
he
groaned
aloud
now
as
he
lay
thus
after
some
while
he
heard
a
swift
light
footfall
the
whisper
of
mail
and
knew
that
she
stood
above
him
yet
he
heeded
not
wherefore
at
last
she
spake
and
gentle
beltane
dear
my
lord
now
dost
thou
know
who
is
fidelis
and
thou
didst
love
fidelis
but
beltane
stirred
not
and
finding
him
silent
she
spake
on
yet
faltering
a
little
when
i
waked
from
my
swoon
within
the
chapel
at
at
blaen
and
found
thee
gone
i
distraught
with
woeful
fear
and
a
most
strange
sickness
took
thy
sword
and
therewith
horse
and
armour
and
in
that
same
hour
fled
from
blaen
none
knowing
many
days
i
rode
seeking
thee
until
love
brought
me
to
thee
in
the
green
but
o
beltane
for
those
dire
chances
of
our
wedding
night
by
what
spells
and
witchcraft
our
happiness
was
changed
to
sorrow
and
dire
amaze
i
know
no
more
than
thou
ah
beltane
dear
my
lord
speak
speak
to
me
and
falling
on
her
knees
she
would
have
lifted
his
head
but
of
a
sudden
he
shrank
away
and
rose
to
his
feet
touch
me
not
i
am
but
a
man
and
thou
art
woman
and
there
is
evil
in
thee
so
touch
me
not
with
thy
false
alluring
hands
o
thou
hast
deceived
me
now
as
ever
as
fidelis
did
i
love
thee
above
all
men
but
for
what
thou
art
i
do
despise
thee
but
with
sudden
gesture
passionate
and
yearning
she
reached
out
her
white
hands
and
kneeling
thus
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
with
love
and
supplication
beltane
she
sighed
beltane
is
thy
great
love
dead
in
very
truth
nay
indeed
i
know
it
liveth
yet
even
as
mine
and
shall
live
on
forever
i
know
i
have
seen
it
leap
within
thine
eyes
heard
it
in
thy
voice
and
wherefore
thou
love
fidelis
look
at
me
beltane
i
can
be
as
brave
as
faithful
and
tender
as
fidelis
look
at
me
but
beltane
dared
not
look
and
trembled
because
of
her
so
great
beauty
and
fain
would
speak
yet
could
not
whereat
she
yet
upon
her
knees
drew
nearer
beltane
she
murmured
trust
me
despite
thyself
o
trust
me
so
shalt
thou
find
happiness
at
last
and
pentavalon
an
end
to
all
her
sorrows
be
thou
my
lord
my
master
my
dear
love
and
husband
ride
with
me
this
night
to
my
fair
mortain
to
mortain
cried
beltane
wildly
aye
to
blaen
belike
to
silken
wantonings
and
to
death
tempt
me
not
o
witch
aye
witch
that
weaveth
spells
of
her
beauty
tempt
me
not
i
say
lest
i
slay
thee
to
mine
own
defence
for
i
know
thee
beyond
all
women
fair
yet
would
i
slay
thee
first
but
groaning
beltane
cast
aside
his
sword
and
covered
burning
eyes
with
burning
palms
yet
shook
as
with
an
ague
fit
the
pleading
hands
fell
to
clasp
and
wring
each
other
her
proud
head
sank
and
a
great
sob
brake
from
her
what
time
beltane
watched
her
with
eyes
bright
with
fever
and
swayed
upon
his
feet
stumbling
he
turned
and
left
her
yet
presently
came
back
leading
the
mars
to
mortain
shalt
thou
ride
i
pray
thee
mount
cried
he
come
mount
i
say
standing
tall
and
proud
before
him
she
sighed
and
spake
then
will
i
leave
thee
an
it
must
be
so
but
in
days
to
come
mayhap
thou
shalt
grieve
for
this
hour
beltane
nor
shall
all
thy
sighs
nor
all
thy
tears
avail
to
bring
it
back
again
thou
hast
shamed
me
oft
yet
for
all
thy
bitter
scorns
i
do
forgive
thee
aye
even
the
anguish
of
my
breaking
heart
for
that
my
love
doth
rise
beyond
my
pain
and
so
dear
my
lord
fare
thee
well
so
she
mounted
whereat
the
mettled
charger
must
needs
rear
and
beltane
staggering
aside
catch
at
a
tree
and
lean
there
art
sick
beltane
she
cried
in
sudden
fear
how
may
i
leave
thee
thus
art
sick
aye
helen
for
thy
beauty
the
devil
is
here
and
i
am
here
so
here
is
no
place
for
thee
so
get
thee
gone
spur
spur
for
despising
thee
in
my
heart
yet
would
i
have
thee
stay
yet
an
thou
stay
needs
must
i
slay
thee
ere
the
dawn
and
myself
thereafter
thus
spake
he
his
voice
loud
his
speech
quick
and
fevered
indeed
sick
my
lord
nor
do
i
fear
thee
thou
noble
son
of
noble
father
my
father
forsooth
he
liveth
in
holy
cross
thicket
within
mortain
he
bade
me
beware
of
women
and
the
ways
of
women
so
do
i
know
thee
witch
thou
golden
helen
ha
must
troy
burn
again
i
loved
thee
once
but
love
is
dead
long
since
and
turned
corrupt
so
get
thee
hence
helen
the
wilful
o
god
pity
thee
my
beltane
for
thou
dost
love
me
yet
even
as
i
love
thee
thou
lonely
god
pity
thee
and
me
also
and
crying
thus
forlorn
and
desolate
the
duchess
helen
rode
upon
her
solitary
way
then
turned
beltane
and
stumbled
on
he
knew
not
whither
and
betimes
he
laughed
loud
and
high
and
betimes
he
was
shaken
by
great
and
fierce
sobs
yet
found
he
never
a
tear
thus
limping
painfully
and
stumbling
anon
as
one
smitten
blind
he
wandered
awhile
and
so
at
length
found
himself
beside
the
little
cave
and
throwing
himself
down
within
its
shadows
tore
away
the
bandages
her
gentle
hands
had
wrought
and
lying
there
it
seemed
that
fidelis
yet
lay
beneath
his
arm
the
fidelis
who
was
no
fidelis
and
in
the
shadows
he
laughed
amain
wild
laughter
that
died
of
a
sudden
choked
by
awful
sobs
what
time
he
clenched
his
hands
upon
his
throbbing
ears
yet
still
above
the
sounds
of
his
own
anguish
needs
must
he
hear
again
that
forlorn
and
desolate
cry
o
god
pity
thee
beltane
and
now
followed
long
hours
when
demons
vile
racked
him
with
anguish
and
mocked
him
with
bitter
gibes
a
haunted
darkness
where
was
fear
and
doubt
and
terror
of
things
unknown
yet
in
the
blackness
a
light
that
grew
to
a
glory
wherein
no
evil
thing
might
be
and
in
this
glory
she
did
stand
tall
and
fair
and
virginal
and
from
the
depths
of
blackness
he
cried
to
her
in
agony
of
remorse
and
from
the
light
she
looked
down
on
him
with
eyes
brimful
of
yearning
love
and
tenderness
for
that
a
gulf
divided
them
but
across
this
hateful
void
she
called
to
him
o
god
pity
thee
my
beltane
chapter
xlv
how
black
roger
taught
beltane
great
wisdom
a
darkness
full
of
a
great
quietude
a
grateful
stillness
slumberous
and
restful
yet
little
by
little
upon
this
silence
a
sound
crept
soft
but
distressful
to
one
who
fain
would
sleep
a
sound
that
grew
a
sharp
noise
and
querulous
and
now
in
the
blackness
a
glimmer
a
furtive
gleam
a
faint
glow
that
grew
brighter
and
yet
more
bright
hurtful
to
eyes
long
used
to
deeps
of
gloom
but
with
the
noise
ever
this
light
grew
from
gleam
to
glow
and
from
glow
to
dazzling
glare
and
so
at
last
beltane
opened
unwilling
eyes
eyes
that
blinked
and
smarted
as
they
beheld
a
leaping
flame
where
a
fire
of
twigs
crackled
merrily
against
a
purple
void
beyond
beholding
all
of
which
beltane
forthwith
shut
his
eyes
again
but
those
soft
deeps
wherein
he
had
found
so
sweet
oblivion
that
great
and
blessed
quietude
were
altogether
vanished
and
beyond
him
to
regain
wherefore
beltane
felt
himself
aggrieved
and
sorrowed
within
himself
and
so
presently
oped
his
reluctant
eyes
and
fell
to
watching
the
play
of
wanton
spark
and
flame
none
the
less
he
knew
himself
yet
aggrieved
also
he
felt
a
sudden
loneliness
wherefore
as
was
become
his
custom
of
late
he
called
on
one
ever
heedful
and
swift
to
answer
his
call
fidelis
he
called
fidelis
yet
came
there
no
one
and
beltane
wondered
vaguely
why
his
voice
should
sound
so
thin
and
far
away
so
troubling
not
to
move
he
called
again
fidelis
art
sleeping
my
fidelis
now
of
a
sudden
one
stirred
amid
the
shadows
beyond
the
fire
mail
gleamed
and
black
roger
bent
over
him
master
he
cried
joyfully
his
eyes
very
bright
o
master
art
awake
at
last
dost
know
roger
thy
man
dost
know
thy
roger
lord
aye
forsooth
i
know
thee
roger
says
beltane
yet
aggrieved
and
querulous
but
i
called
not
thee
send
me
fidelis
where
tarries
fidelis
master
i
know
not
he
came
to
me
within
the
hollow
six
nights
agone
and
gave
to
me
his
horse
and
bid
me
seek
thee
here
thereafter
went
he
afoot
by
the
forest
road
and
i
rode
hither
and
found
thee
according
to
his
word
then
would
beltane
have
risen
but
could
not
and
stared
at
black
roger
pitiful
face
with
eyes
of
wonder
why
roger
quoth
he
why
roger
thou
hast
been
very
nigh
to
death
master
a
i
found
thee
in
sooth
foaming
master
and
crying
in
direful
voice
of
spells
and
magic
bewitched
wert
thou
master
in
very
sooth
and
strove
and
fought
with
me
and
wept
as
no
man
should
weep
and
all
by
reason
of
a
vile
enchantment
which
the
sweet
saints
forfend
so
here
hast
thou
lain
on
the
borders
of
death
and
here
have
i
ministered
to
thee
as
sir
fidelis
did
teach
me
and
but
for
these
medicaments
i
had
wept
upon
thy
grave
for
wert
direly
sick
lord
and
nay
here
is
no
matter
tell
me
tell
me
where
is
fidelis
dear
master
i
know
not
forsooth
went
he
by
the
forest
road
aye
master
the
forest
road
afoot
afoot
lord
said
he
aught
to
thee
of
of
me
roger
aye
was
all
of
thee
and
thy
wound
and
how
to
ease
thy
pain
i
must
do
this
forsooth
and
that
forsooth
and
to
break
the
fever
must
mix
and
give
thee
certain
cordials
the
which
i
have
done
said
he
aught
beside
aught
else
roger
aye
master
he
bid
me
pray
for
thee
the
which
i
have
also
done
though
i
had
rather
fight
for
thee
nathless
the
sweet
saints
have
answered
even
my
poor
prayers
for
behold
thou
art
alive
and
shall
be
well
anon
now
after
this
beltane
lay
with
eyes
fast
shut
and
spake
not
thus
he
lay
so
long
that
roger
thinking
he
slept
again
would
have
moved
away
but
beltane
feeble
hand
stayed
him
and
he
spake
yet
with
eyes
still
closed
by
the
forest
road
roger
aye
master
alone
roger
aye
lord
alone
and
afoot
roger
aye
lord
he
bade
me
take
his
horse
that
i
might
come
to
thee
the
sooner
and
bid
thee
pray
for
me
for
me
roger
verily
master
and
pray
i
did
right
lustily
so
do
i
thank
thee
roger
said
beltane
speaking
ever
with
closed
eyes
yet
i
would
that
god
had
let
me
die
roger
and
behold
from
these
closed
eyes
great
tears
and
painful
that
rolled
the
pallid
cheek
very
bright
in
the
and
glistening
like
the
fairest
gems
master
o
master
cried
roger
dost
grieve
thee
for
sir
fidelis
forsooth
i
must
roger
he
was
a
peerless
friend
methinks
aye
master
and
noble
lady
roger
o
roger
how
learned
you
this
speak
lord
thou
hast
had
visions
and
talked
much
within
thy
sickness
so
do
i
know
that
thou
dost
love
the
duchess
helen
that
men
do
call
beautiful
i
do
know
that
on
thy
marriage
night
thou
wert
snatched
away
to
shameful
prison
i
do
know
that
she
because
her
heart
was
as
great
as
her
love
did
follow
thee
in
knightly
guise
and
thou
did
most
ungently
drive
her
from
thee
all
this
and
much
beside
thou
didst
shout
and
whisper
in
thy
fever
quoth
beltane
plucking
at
roger
with
feeble
hand
roger
o
roger
since
this
thou
knowest
tell
me
tell
me
can
faith
and
treachery
lie
thus
within
one
woman
heart
and
of
all
women
her
master
can
white
be
black
can
day
be
night
can
heaven
be
hell
or
can
truth
lie
so
an
sir
fidelis
be
faithful
and
faithful
forsooth
is
he
so
is
the
duchess
helen
faithful
nay
an
she
be
true
o
roger
an
she
be
true
indeed
how
think
you
of
the
treachery
of
i
think
here
was
witchcraft
master
spells
thou
and
magic
black
and
damned
as
thou
wert
true
to
her
so
was
she
true
to
thee
as
true
as
aye
as
true
as
i
am
and
true
am
i
saint
cuthbert
knoweth
that
who
hath
heard
my
prayers
full
oft
of
late
master
now
god
bless
thee
roger
o
god
bless
thee
so
crying
of
a
sudden
beltane
caught
black
roger
hand
and
kissed
it
and
thereafter
turned
him
to
the
shadows
and
lying
thus
beltane
wept
very
bitterly
yet
very
silent
until
like
a
grieving
child
he
had
wept
himself
to
forgetfulness
and
sleep
so
slept
he
clasped
within
mailed
arm
but
full
oft
black
roger
lifted
his
bronzed
right
hand
the
hand
that
had
felt
beltane
sudden
kiss
and
needs
must
he
view
it
with
eyes
of
wonder
as
if
it
had
been
indeed
some
holy
thing
what
time
he
kept
his
midnight
vigil
beside
the
fire
chapter
xlvi
how
black
roger
prayed
in
the
dawn
and
how
his
prayers
were
answered
holy
saint
cuthbert
art
a
very
sweet
and
potent
saint
and
therefore
hast
good
eyes
which
is
well
so
canst
thou
see
him
for
thyself
how
weak
he
is
and
languid
that
was
a
mighty
man
and
lusty
cherish
him
i
pray
thee
a
goodly
youth
thou
dost
know
him
thou
didst
see
him
burn
a
gibbet
moreover
i
have
told
thee
and
eke
a
knight
of
high
degree
yet
doth
he
lie
here
direly
sick
of
body
cherish
him
i
pray
moreover
sick
is
he
of
mind
for
that
he
loveth
one
a
lady
methinks
good
and
worthy
so
bring
them
together
these
twain
not
above
as
saints
in
heaven
but
first
as
man
and
woman
that
shall
beget
such
men
as
he
such
noble
dames
as
she
and
make
the
world
a
better
place
therefor
see
you
to
this
matter
good
saint
cuthbert
and
also
the
matter
of
his
dukedom
but
when
he
shall
be
duke
indeed
and
blest
with
her
that
is
so
fair
a
maid
and
apt
to
motherhood
i
pray
thee
saint
cuthbert
let
him
not
forget
me
whose
soul
he
saved
long
since
within
the
green
in
the
matter
of
beda
that
was
a
jester
i
pray
thee
let
him
have
regard
to
black
roger
that
am
his
man
henceforth
to
the
end
amen
holy
saint
cuthbert
grant
me
this
it
was
black
roger
praying
in
the
dawn
his
broadsword
set
upright
in
the
ling
his
hands
devoutly
crossed
and
his
black
head
stooped
full
low
thus
he
saw
not
beltane
eyes
upon
him
until
his
prayer
was
ended
quoth
beltane
then
may
heaven
grant
thee
thy
prayer
roger
was
a
good
prayer
and
i
the
better
for
it
why
look
now
master
says
roger
somewhat
abashed
i
am
a
something
better
prayer
than
i
was
and
i
pray
in
good
saxon
english
thus
do
i
call
on
saint
cuthbert
that
was
a
lusty
saxon
ere
that
he
was
a
saint
but
roger
what
need
to
supplicate
lest
i
forget
thee
think
you
i
should
forget
my
faithful
roger
why
lord
says
roger
busily
preparing
wherewith
to
break
their
fast
when
a
man
marrieth
see
you
and
thereafter
proceedeth
forthwith
to
get
him
children
as
the
custom
is
nay
dost
talk
folly
roger
quoth
beltane
his
pale
cheek
flushing
yet
folly
thou
dost
dream
of
master
and
she
also
else
wherefore
love
nay
roger
doth
belsaye
lie
secure
yet
what
of
walkyn
and
our
comrades
marched
they
to
belsaye
as
i
did
command
why
see
you
now
master
when
our
foes
came
not
and
you
came
not
we
sent
word
to
belsaye
that
within
two
days
we
would
march
thither
according
to
thy
word
and
forthwith
giles
sends
word
back
that
he
was
very
well
and
wanted
no
walkyn
or
surly
roger
to
share
authority
with
him
yet
a
while
and
bid
us
twirl
our
thumbs
within
the
green
until
he
commanded
our
presence
with
divers
other
ribald
japes
and
wanton
toys
whereon
walkyn
and
i
waxed
something
wroth
therefore
when
ye
came
not
our
comrades
fell
to
factions
and
riot
whereat
i
perforce
smote
me
one
or
two
and
walkyn
three
or
four
and
so
brought
peace
among
them
but
when
we
would
have
tarried
yet
for
thee
these
clamoured
for
walkyn
to
lead
them
into
the
wild
back
to
their
ancient
outlawry
so
loud
they
clamoured
and
so
oft
that
in
the
end
walkyn
smiled
a
strange
thing
in
him
master
but
he
agreed
whereon
we
came
nigh
to
cutting
each
other
throats
he
and
howbeit
in
the
end
he
went
he
and
all
the
other
rogues
so
bided
i
alone
in
the
hollow
day
and
night
waiting
thee
master
and
at
the
last
cometh
sir
fidelis
and
so
all
said
and
behold
thy
breakfast
a
coney
see
you
lord
that
i
snared
but
our
company
gone
outlaws
spending
their
lives
to
no
purpose
here
is
evil
news
roger
here
is
tender
meat
master
and
delicate
back
to
outlawry
and
walkyn
too
aye
but
he
smiled
master
walkyn
methinks
is
not
a
jovial
soul
lord
and
when
he
smileth
it
behoveth
others
to
frown
and
beware
so
prithee
eat
hearty
lord
for
in
a
while
the
sun
will
stand
above
yon
and
then
be
the
eleventh
hour
and
at
the
eleventh
hour
must
i
wash
thy
hurt
and
it
with
this
good
ointment
what
then
then
shalt
thou
sleep
master
and
i
to
the
woods
with
my
bow
to
get
us
meat
sweet
juicy
venison
an
the
saints
be
kind
and
wherefore
at
the
eleventh
hour
for
that
she
did
so
command
me
master
she
sighed
beltane
aye
forsooth
master
she
that
the
good
saint
cuthbert
shall
give
to
thy
close
embracements
one
day
think
you
so
spake
beltane
beneath
his
breath
and
staring
across
the
sunny
glade
with
eyes
of
yearning
think
you
so
indeed
roger
of
a
surety
lord
nodded
roger
seeing
that
i
do
plague
the
good
saint
on
the
matter
continually
for
master
when
i
pray
i
do
pray
right
lustily
so
in
a
while
the
meal
done
and
crock
and
pannikin
washed
and
set
aside
beltane
leg
is
bathed
and
dressed
right
skilfully
with
hands
for
all
their
strength
and
hardness
wondrous
light
and
gentle
thereafter
stretched
upon
his
bed
of
heather
beltane
watches
black
roger
gird
on
belt
and
quiver
and
bow
in
hand
stride
blithely
into
the
green
and
ere
he
knows
it
is
asleep
and
in
his
sleep
beholds
one
who
bends
to
kiss
him
white
hands
outstretched
and
all
heaven
in
her
eyes
and
with
her
voice
thrilling
in
his
ears
wakes
to
find
the
sun
already
westering
and
black
roger
near
by
who
squatting
before
a
rough
table
he
has
contrived
set
close
beside
the
fire
whereon
a
cooking
pot
seethes
and
bubbles
is
busied
with
certain
brewings
infusings
and
mixings
in
pipkin
and
pannikin
and
all
with
brow
of
frowning
portent
whereat
says
beltane
wondering
what
do
ye
good
roger
master
i
mix
thee
thy
decoction
as
she
did
instruct
she
is
a
learned
youth
master
sir
fidelis
in
these
dried
herbs
and
simples
look
you
lieth
thy
health
and
strength
and
pentavalon
freedom
aye
a
notable
youth
in
faith
thy
duchess
hereupon
beltane
remembering
his
dream
must
needs
close
his
eyes
that
he
may
dream
again
and
is
upon
the
portal
of
sleep
when
roger
hand
rouses
him
what
roger
master
thy
draught
take
it
hence
nay
it
must
be
swallowed
master
then
swallow
it
thyself
nay
lord
is
the
hour
for
thy
draught
appointed
by
sir
fidelis
and
she
must
be
obeyed
come
master
forthwith
yet
remembering
his
dream
beltane
opens
unwilling
eyes
and
more
unwilling
mouth
and
the
draught
is
swallowed
whereupon
comes
languor
and
sleep
and
therewith
more
dreams
anon
is
and
the
stars
one
by
one
peep
forth
of
the
darkening
heaven
shadows
steal
and
lengthen
and
lo
is
night
a
night
wherein
the
placid
moon
climbing
apace
fills
the
silent
world
with
the
splendour
of
her
advent
and
ever
and
always
beltane
lies
in
slumber
but
in
his
sleep
he
groans
full
oft
and
oft
doth
call
upon
a
name
a
cry
and
weak
yet
full
of
a
passionate
yearning
whereupon
cometh
sturdy
roger
to
behold
him
in
the
light
of
the
fire
to
stoop
and
soothe
him
with
gentle
hand
thus
needs
must
he
mark
the
glitter
of
a
tear
upon
that
pale
and
sunken
cheek
wherefore
black
roger
own
eyes
must
needs
fall
and
he
to
grieving
amain
in
so
much
that
of
a
sudden
he
stealeth
swiftly
from
the
cave
and
drawing
sword
setteth
it
in
the
ling
then
kneeling
with
bowed
head
and
reverent
hands
forthwith
fell
to
his
prayers
after
this
wise
sweet
cuthbert
gentle
saint
behind
me
in
the
shadows
lieth
my
master
in
his
slumber
so
needs
must
i
weep
also
since
i
do
love
him
for
that
he
is
a
man
good
saint
cuthbert
i
have
wrought
for
him
my
best
as
thou
hast
seen
tended
his
hurt
thrice
daily
and
ministered
the
potion
as
i
was
commanded
i
have
worked
for
him
prayed
for
him
yet
doth
he
weep
great
tears
within
his
sleep
so
now
do
i
place
him
in
thy
care
good
saint
for
thou
dost
know
me
but
poor
rogue
roger
a
rough
man
and
all
unlearned
yet
even
so
i
do
most
truly
love
him
and
loving
him
do
fear
for
meseemeth
his
hurt
is
deeper
than
hurt
of
body
he
doth
pine
him
and
grieve
for
lack
of
his
desire
a
young
man
sweet
saint
that
doth
yearn
for
a
maid
right
fair
and
noble
amours
good
saint
as
is
the
custom
but
alack
she
is
far
hence
and
he
lieth
here
sick
and
like
to
perish
and
i
am
but
poor
roger
a
very
sinful
man
that
knoweth
not
what
to
do
so
do
i
call
on
thee
sweet
saint
achieve
me
a
miracle
on
his
behalf
bring
him
to
his
heart
desire
that
he
may
wax
hale
and
well
and
weep
no
more
within
his
sleep
and
this
do
i
ask
for
his
sake
and
his
lady
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
pentavalon
duchy
not
forgetting
poor
roger
that
doth
plague
thee
thus
for
love
of
him
amen
now
behold
even
as
the
prayer
was
ended
came
a
faint
stir
and
rustle
amid
the
leaves
hard
by
and
lifting
startled
head
black
roger
beheld
a
radiant
vision
standing
in
the
pale
glory
of
the
moon
whereat
he
knew
fear
and
a
great
awe
o
good
saint
cuthbert
and
is
it
thou
indeed
he
whispered
sweet
saint
i
thought
not
to
win
thee
down
from
heaven
thus
though
forsooth
i
did
pray
right
lustily
but
since
thou
art
come
hush
good
roger
spake
a
voice
soft
and
wondrous
sweet
to
hear
and
so
speaking
the
shining
figure
raised
the
vizor
of
its
helm
o
hush
thee
roger
for
he
sleepeth
all
day
unseen
have
i
watched
over
him
nor
can
i
leave
him
until
his
strength
be
come
again
and
sleep
is
life
to
him
so
wake
him
not
come
your
ways
for
i
would
speak
thee
many
things
follow
as
one
that
dreams
roger
stared
into
the
eyes
beneath
the
vizor
and
as
one
that
dreams
he
rose
up
from
his
knees
and
sheathing
his
sword
followed
whither
the
gleaming
vision
led
yet
betimes
he
blinked
upon
the
moon
and
once
he
shook
his
head
and
spake
as
to
himself
verily
aye
verily
a
lusty

chapter
xlvii
how
beltane
sware
an
oath
slowly
the
days
sped
dewy
dawn
and
tender
eve
days
of
sun
and
shadow
and
gentle
rain
golden
days
wherein
beltane
lay
sleep
and
wake
and
nights
of
silver
wherein
he
slept
full
deep
and
dreamed
wondrously
of
gentle
hands
that
soothed
him
with
their
touch
and
warm
soft
lips
on
cheek
and
brow
that
filled
him
with
a
great
and
deep
content
and
in
these
days
who
so
cheery
as
black
roger
full
of
a
gaiety
who
laughed
for
small
reason
and
ofttimes
for
none
at
all
and
was
forever
humming
snatches
of
strange
song
as
he
stooped
above
pipkin
and
pannikin
much
given
was
he
also
to
frequent
comings
and
goings
within
the
green
to
no
apparent
end
while
beltane
within
the
little
cave
lay
sleep
and
waking
moreover
full
oft
as
they
ate
their
evening
meal
together
he
would
start
and
falling
to
sudden
silence
sit
as
one
that
hearkens
to
distant
sounds
yet
withal
was
he
ever
heedful
of
beltane
many
wants
who
as
health
came
grew
more
eager
to
be
gone
but
finding
himself
too
weak
straightway
waxed
moody
and
rebellious
whereat
smiling
roger
waxed
firm
so
needs
must
frowning
beltane
be
bathed
and
bandaged
and
swallow
his
draught
because
of
she
who
had
so
commanded
now
it
befell
upon
a
certain
evening
as
roger
bent
to
peer
into
the
pot
that
seethed
and
bubbled
upon
the
fire
and
to
sniff
its
appetising
savour
he
presently
fell
to
himself
in
a
voice
gruff
yet
musical
withal
whereupon
beltane
turning
languid
head
fell
to
watching
this
new
roger
and
thereafter
spake
on
this
wise
beltane
what
do
ye
so
oft
within
the
green
roger
hunt
that
we
may
eat
master
beltane
i
have
seen
thee
go
full
oft
of
late
and
leave
thy
bow
behind
roger
roger
whereby
i
judge
that
though
thine
eyes
be
shut
ye
do
not
always
slumber
master
and
methinks
our
supper
is
done
beltane
nay
what
do
ye
in
the
green
roger
master
thy
horse
mars
hath
a
proud
spirit
and
snorteth
against
his
bonds
so
lest
he
break
thy
slumber
have
i
made
him
a
shelter
of
wattles
in
the
green
beltane
truly
roger
thou
art
greatly
changed
methinks
roger
starting
as
how
master
beltane
i
have
heard
thee
called
roger
the
grim
and
roger
the
surly
ere
now
roger
shaking
woeful
head
ere
now
lord
i
hanged
men
conceiving
it
my
duty
beltane
and
you
sing
and
wherefore
roger
for
joy
in
life
master
beltane
and
thou
dost
laugh
surly
roger
for
little
reason
meseemeth
roger
for
that
my
heart
is
renewed
within
me
master
happiness
is
my
bedfellow
and
companion
here
is
good
reason
for
laughter
methinks
beltane
and
wherefore
art
thou
happy
roger
roger
item
first
thou
dost
mend
apace
lord
item
second
this
mess
of
venison
hath
a
savour
most
delectable
item
third
happiness
is
the
birthright
of
every
man
moreover
i
have
learned
that
behind
the
blackest
cloud
is
a
glory
of
sun
and
beyond
sorrow
joy
so
do
i
rejoice
that
all
is
like
to
be
well
with
thee
beltane
bitterly
well
with
me
say
you
is
pentavalon
free
roger
do
i
not
lie
here
weak
and
helpless
my
company
scattered
o
call
you
this
well
forsooth
roger
is
true
thou
art
weak
as
yet
master
but
thou
shalt
rise
again
stronger
than
aforetime
aye
thou
shalt
arise
indeed
and
all
pentavalon
with
thee
so
let
thine
heart
rejoice
and
sing
as
mine
doth
beltane
fiercely
o
evil
day
that
ere
i
gave
my
heart
to
love
so
do
i
lie
here
a
useless
thing
o
day
accursed
roger
o
day
most
blessed
since
woman
love
hath
lifted
thee
from
death
and
shall
be
thy
glory
and
pentavalon
salvation
master

eagerly
roger
roger
speak
you
of
the
duchess
helen
what
mean
you
man
roger
there
be
signs
and
portents
master
the
very
air
is
full
them
whiles
we
tarry
here
others
be
up
and
doing
beltane
others
roger
roger
notably
walkyn
o
the
axe
master
beltane
ha
and
what
of
walkyn
roger
he
smiled
master
as
i
told
thee
ere
this
and
when
walkyn
smileth
it
behoveth
others
to
be
wary
so
now
do
i
tell
thee
that
walkyn
hath
taken
and
burned
duke
ivo
great
castle
of
brandonmere
that
winisfarne
city
hath
risen
the
duke
and
all
the
border
villages
likewise
aha
master
there
be
and
good
brown
bills
all
along
the
marches
eager
to
smite
for
freedom
and
pentavalon
when
time
is
ripe
beltane
rising
upon
his
knees
forsooth
is
this
so
o
roger
is
this
so
in
very
truth
roger
is
very
truth
master
upon
my
sword
i
swear
it
beltane
but
whence
had
ye
the
wondrous
news
how
when
roger
master
was
three
nights
agone
as
i
wrestled
prodigiously
in
prayer
on
thy
behalf
one
came
to
me
and
spake
me
many
things
marvellous
good
to
hear
moreover
i
have
met
divers
folk
within
the
greenwood
and
upon
the
yonder
and
with
all
do
i
hold
converse
then
to
roger
amaze
beltane
rose
up
and
standing
square
upon
his
feet
lifted
hands
and
eyes
to
heaven
now
glory
be
to
the
living
god
quoth
he
that
hath
heard
the
prayers
of
such
as
i
so
now
do
i
swear
come
life
come
death
to
walk
my
appointed
way
sword
in
hand
henceforth
nor
will
i
turn
aside
for
man
or
woman
heeding
not
the
lure
of
friendship
or
of
love
i
do
swear
never
to
look
upon
a
woman
to
love
roger
fearfully
master
master
beltane
nor
to
suffer
woman
love
to
come
me
and
my
duty
roger
despairingly
o
master
swear
it
not
swear
it
not
beltane
nor
shall
aught
let
or
stay
me
until
pentavalon
win
to
freedom
or
my
poor
soul
return
whence
it
came
and
this
do
i
swear
to
the
ears
of
god
now
turned
he
to
roger
and
with
hands
roger
said
he
thou
art
witness
to
this
my
oath
an
i
do
fail
or
falter
henceforth
then
in
that
same
hour
may
sharp
death
be
mine
so
now
bring
to
me
sword
and
armour
for
this
night
must
i
hence
now
was
roger
sore
troubled
and
fain
was
to
speak
but
beholding
his
master
flashing
eye
he
presently
did
as
he
was
commanded
so
beltane
took
hold
upon
the
sword
and
drew
it
and
looked
upon
its
broad
and
shining
blade
but
when
he
would
have
wielded
it
behold
he
scarce
could
lift
it
with
teeth
he
strove
against
his
weakness
until
his
breath
waxed
short
and
the
sweat
ran
from
him
but
ever
the
great
blade
grew
the
heavier
then
he
groaned
to
find
himself
so
feeble
and
cried
aloud
an
exceeding
bitter
cry
and
cast
the
sword
from
him
and
staggering
fell
into
roger
waiting
arms
forthwith
roger
bare
him
to
the
cave
and
laid
him
down
upon
his
bed
master
quoth
he
o
master
grieve
not
thyself
thou
shalt
be
hale
and
strong
anon
but
the
time
is
not
yet
comfort
ye
comfort
ye
my
lord
ere
long
thou
shalt
be
strong
aye
and
mightier
than
aforetime
so
grieve
not
nor
repine
my
master
but
beltane
lay
heeding
not
nor
would
he
eat
despite
all
wheedling
arts
but
being
fevered
and
athirst
drank
deep
of
the
sleeping
draught
and
thereafter
falling
to
his
black
humour
turned
his
face
to
the
shadows
and
lying
thus
straightway
fell
to
weeping
very
silently
because
of
his
so
great
weakness
until
like
a
child
he
had
wept
himself
to
sleep
slowly
the
moon
sank
the
fire
burned
low
and
roger
snored
blissfully
hard
by
but
beltane
blessed
within
his
slumbers
dreamed
again
of
one
who
stole
light
of
foot
to
lie
beside
him
watchful
in
the
dark
and
with
warm
soft
arms
set
close
about
him
like
the
sheltering
arms
of
that
mother
he
had
never
known
thus
slept
beltane
like
a
weary
child
upon
a
mother
breast
and
knew
great
peace
and
solace
and
a
deep
and
utter
content
chapter
xlviii
how
beltane
set
out
for
hangstone
waste
day
by
day
beltane
waxed
in
health
and
strength
and
daily
leaning
upon
roger
trusty
arm
he
walked
further
afield
and
day
by
day
with
growing
strength
so
grew
his
doubt
and
therewith
by
times
a
black
despond
for
needs
must
he
think
ever
of
helen
the
beautiful
and
fain
was
he
to
tear
her
from
his
heart
yet
could
not
then
fain
he
would
have
hated
her
but
in
his
ears
her
cry
rang
still
god
pity
thee
my
beltane
wherefore
he
was
wont
to
fall
to
sudden
gloom
and
melancholy
but
upon
a
certain
blithe
evening
black
roger
stood
leaning
on
his
to
watch
where
beltane
swam
the
pool
with
mighty
strokes
who
laughing
for
very
joy
of
it
presently
sprang
ashore
panting
with
his
exertions
and
fell
to
donning
his
garments
how
think
ye
roger
he
cried
am
i
fit
to
adventure
me
the
world
again
forsooth
master
art
well
of
thy
wound
and
fever
and
in
a
week
or
so
mayhap
thou
shalt
perchance
be
well
enough
a
week
roger
i
tell
thee
man
this
very
day
will
i
hence
but
master
says
roger
shaking
cautious
head
thy
world
is
a
world
of
battles
and
for
battle
art
scarce
yet
strong
enough
say
ye
so
roger
then
here
and
now
shalt
make
trial
of
me
art
a
tall
and
lusty
fellow
come
man
let
us
try
a
fall
together
and
mark
this
roger
an
thou
canst
put
me
on
my
back
shalt
have
thy
will
in
the
matter
but
an
i
down
thee
then
hey
for
horse
and
armour
and
the
this
very
night
come
agreed
now
hereupon
the
wily
roger
noting
the
pallor
of
beltane
sunken
cheek
and
how
his
broad
breast
laboured
yet
and
moreover
feeling
himself
aglow
with
lusty
life
and
vigour
smiled
grimly
nothing
doubting
the
issue
wherefore
he
nodded
his
head
so
be
it
master
said
he
only
take
thy
wind
first
so
saying
he
set
aside
bow
and
quiver
loosed
off
his
sword
and
tightening
his
belt
stepped
towards
beltane
his
broad
back
stooped
his
knotted
arms
advanced
and
fingers
crooked
to
grapple
once
and
twice
he
circled
seeking
a
hold
then
leapt
he
swift
and
low
arms
and
fingers
clenched
and
locked
and
beltane
was
bent
swayed
and
borne
from
his
feet
but
even
so
with
a
cunning
twist
he
brake
black
roger
hold
and
staggered
free
quoth
he
art
a
very
strong
man
roger
stronger
than
methought
come
again
once
more
they
circled
heedfully
for
beltane
had
grown
more
wary
thrice
he
sought
a
certain
hold
and
thrice
black
roger
foiled
him
ere
sudden
and
grim
he
leapt
and
closed
and
breast
to
breast
they
strove
fiercely
mighty
arms
straining
and
writhing
swaying
reeling
in
desperate
grapple
now
to
roger
strength
and
quickness
beltane
opposed
craft
and
cunning
but
wily
roger
met
guile
with
guile
nor
was
to
be
allured
to
slack
or
change
his
gripe
therefore
of
a
sudden
beltane
put
forth
his
strength
and
wrestled
mightily
seeking
to
break
or
weaken
roger
deadly
hold
but
iron
arms
gripped
and
held
him
fast
crushed
him
checked
him
aha
master
panted
roger
now
i
have
thee
and
therewith
heaved
right
lustily
felt
beltane
yield
and
stagger
slacked
his
grip
for
the
final
hold
and
in
that
moment
his
arms
were
burst
asunder
he
was
whirled
up
kicking
earth
and
heaven
laid
gently
upon
the
sward
and
sitting
up
found
beltane
lying
breathless
beside
him
was
a
trick
roger
he
panted
i
beat
thee
but
by
an
artifice
yet
beaten
i
am
master
quoth
roger
vastly
rueful
and
art
mightier
than
i
thought
thee
roger
master
i
have
wrestled
oft
with
gefroi
that
was
the
duke
wrestler
then
art
a
better
man
than
he
meseemeth
quoth
beltane
yet
thou
hast
beaten
me
master
so
within
the
hour
we
will
begone
to
our
duty
roger
whither
lord
first
to
winisfarne
and
thence
south
to
belsaye
with
every
lusty
fellow
we
can
muster
how
think
you
i
think
the
time
is
not
yet
master
wherefore
for
that
though
things
go
well
with
thee
and
thy
cause
yet
shall
they
go
better
anon
nevertheless
roger
within
the
hour
we
march
so
come
first
let
us
eat
for
i
do
famish
so
when
they
had
caught
their
breath
again
together
they
arose
and
coming
to
the
cave
beneath
the
steep
they
the
fire
and
set
the
pot
thereon
which
done
roger
brought
forth
his
lord
armour
bright
and
newly
polished
and
in
a
while
beltane
stood
a
shining
figure
from
golden
spur
to
gleaming
bascinet
thereafter
roger
armed
him
likewise
and
as
two
they
sat
together
and
ate
their
meal
with
mighty
appetite
and
gusto
now
presently
as
they
sat
thus
beltane
espied
a
thing
that
lay
by
roger
knee
and
taking
it
up
behold
was
a
wallet
of
leather
very
artfully
wrought
and
gazing
upon
it
he
must
needs
fall
to
sudden
thought
whereto
he
sighed
full
deep
and
oft
till
finding
roger
watching
him
he
forthwith
checked
his
sighs
and
frowned
instead
roger
quoth
he
whence
had
ye
this
thing
my
lord
from
her
the
sweet
knight
sir
fidelis
thy
lady
why
wilt
thou
call
her
my
lady
roger
for
that
is
she

and
sigh
for
she
that
doth
love
thee
and
shall
bear
thee
right
fair
and
lusty
children

i
pray
and
my
prayers
are
potent

days

his
head
must

matters

and
nigh

the
holy
saints

evil
spell

not
come
nigh

and
thou
didst
yearn
and
cry
continually
for

and
strong

behold
things
with
mind

since
that
evil
day
we
met
yon
accursed
witch
of
hangstone

never
been

do
ye
mind
me
how
this
woman
did
speak
me
of

and
wonders

to
fouler
bewitchments
howbeit

will

and
deadly
o
bethink

lest

into
a
swine
or
black
dog

or
even
a
small
i

less

so
master
at
the
full
o
the
moon
lord
now
do
i
beseech
thee
and
the
moon
will
be
full
roger
go
you
and
saddle
now
the
horse
forthwith
went
roger
gloomy
and
nothing
speaking
what
time
beltane
sat
there
staring
down
at
the
wallet
on
his
knee
bethinking
him
of
many
things
and
for
that
he
was
alone
sighing
deep
and
oft
and
so
very
suddenly
hung
the
wallet
to
his
girdle
and
thereafter
arose
in
a
while
cometh
gloomy
roger
leading
the
destrier
mars
whereon
gloomy
beltane
swung
to
saddle
and
looking
round
about
him
once
and
twice
rode
slowly
towards
where
beyond
the
shade
of
trees
the
forest
road
ran
north
and
south
but
as
for
roger
needs
must
he
pause
upon
the
edge
of
the
clearing
to
look
back
at
the
little
cave
beneath
the
steep
whereby
the
small
flowed
murmurously
a
while
he
stood
thus
to
frown
and
shake
gloomy
head
then
lifted
he
his
hand
on
high
much
as
he
had
bid
one
sorrowful
farewell
and
turning
about
trudged
away
after
his
lord
chapter
xlix
how
beltane
found
peace
and
a
great
sorrow
it
had
been
an
evening
of
cloud
but
now
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
moon
shone
bright
and
round
as
they
reached
that
desolate
heath
that
went
by
the
name
of
hangstone
waste
a
solitary
place
at
all
times
but
more
especially
wild
and
awful
the
ghostly
moon
wherefore
roger
went
and
fearful
and
kept
fast
hold
of
beltane
stirrup
ha
master
master
cried
he
chattering
teeth
not
hear
it
master
nay
answered
beltane
checking
his
horse
what
was
it
where
away
was
a
cry
master
beyond
the
marsh
yonder
is
there
again
was
an
owl
roger
was
a
soul
master
a
poor
damned
soul
and
desolate
we
shall
see
dire
and
dreadful
sights
on
hangstone
waste
this
night
master
holy
saint
cuthbert
what
was
yon
nought
but
a
bat
roger
a
bat
lord
never
think
so
here
was
belike
a
noble
knight
or
a
lusty
fellow
into
a
bat
good
master
let
us
go
no
further
if
thou
hast
no
thought
for
thyself
have
a
little
heed
for
poor
roger
why
look
ye
good
roger
canst
go
where
thou
wilt
but
as
for
me
i
ride
for
the
white
nay
then
an
blasted
this
night
master
needs
must
i
be
blasted
with
thee
yonder
lieth
the
across
the
waste
and
now
may
saint
cuthbert
and
saint
bede
have
us
in
their
blessed
care
amen
so
they
began
to
cross
the
rolling
desolation
of
the
heath
and
presently
espied
a
great
boulder
huge
and
solitary
gleaming
white
and
ghostly
the
moon
being
come
very
nigh
beltane
checked
his
horse
and
was
about
to
dismount
when
roger
uttering
a
sudden
gasping
cry
cowered
to
his
knees
for
in
the
air
about
them
was
a
sound
very
sweet
to
hear
the
whisper
of
softly
plucked
by
skilled
and
cunning
fingers
and
thereafter
a
man
voice
rich
and
melodious
brake
forth
into
tender
singing
and
the
words
were
these
o
moon
o
gentle
moon
unveil
thy
softest
light
where
feet
i
love
so
small
and
white
do
bear
my
love
to
me
stand
up
roger
here
is
nought
to
harm
us
methinks
quoth
beltane
softly
stand
up
and
hold
my
bridle
but
see
now
master
there
be
a
many
that
do
pipe
like
very
angels
nathless
here
one
that
i
must
speak
with
said
beltane
slipping
to
earth
and
looking
about
him
with
wondering
eyes
for
the
voice
had
seemed
to
come
from
the
grass
at
his
feet
and
while
he
yet
sought
to
and
fro
in
frowning
perplexity
the
melodious
voice
brake
forth
anew
o
little
feet
more
white
than
snow
if
through
the
thorny
brake
ye
go
my
loving
heart
i
set
below
to
take
the
hurt
for
thee
now
as
the
voice
sank
and
the
quivered
to
silence
beltane
coming
behind
the
great
rock
beheld
a
glow
very
faint
and
feeble
that
shone
through
leaves
and
putting
aside
a
that
grew
against
the
rock
perceived
a
low
and
narrow
alley
or
leading
downwards
into
the
earth
lighted
by
a
soft
mellow
beam
that
brightened
as
he
advanced
and
presently
showed
him
a
chamber
cunningly
hollowed
within
the
rock
and
adorned
with
rich
furs
and
skins
and
behold
one
who
reclined
upon
a
couch
of
skins
a
slender
youthful
figure
with
one
foot
wondrously
and
swathed
who
beholding
beltane
gleaming
mail
sprang
up
very
nimbly
and
fronted
him
with
naked
sword
advanced
nay
hast
forgot
thy
friend
sir
jocelyn
incontinent
the
sword
was
tossed
aside
and
with
a
joyous
cry
sir
jocelyn
sprang
and
caught
him
in
close
embrace
now
by
sweet
venus
her
downy
dove
is
beltane
he
cried
now
welcome
and
thrice
welcome
my
lordly
smith
thou
mighty
son
of
noble
father
ah
lord
duke
i
loved
thee
that
day
thou
didst
outmatch
gefroi
the
wrestler
in
the
green
since
then
much
have
i
learned
of
thee
and
thy
valiant
doings
more
especially
of
barham
broom
how
thou
didst
slay
the
vile
sir
gilles
the
eyes
of
ivo
and
all
his
powers
and
thereby
didst
snatch
from
shame
and
cruel
death
one
that
is
become
the
very
heart
of
me
so
needs
must
i
love
and
honour
and
cherish
thee
so
long
as
i
be
jocelyn
and
thou
thy
noble
self
come
sit
ye
sit
ye
here
for
fain
am
i
to
question
thee
but
said
beltane
wrinkling
puzzled
brow
how
came
you
hither
and
art
wounded
jocelyn
aye
my
lord
to
desperation
o
direly
beltane
i
do
languish
night
and
day
sleep
doth
bring
me
no
surcease
and
music
alack
abatement
none
food
base
food
repelleth
me
and
wine
no
savour
hath
verily
verily
wounded
deep
am
i
forsooth
said
beltane
thy
foot
doth
wear
bandages
a
many
but
bandages
cried
jocelyn
staring
foot
nay
nay
my
torment
is
not
here
and
he
flourished
his
beswathed
foot
in
an
airy
dancing
step
indeed
beltane
herein
do
i
confess
me
some
small
artifice
yet
mark
me
to
a
sweet
and
worthy
end
for
my
hurt
lieth
here
sore
smit
am
i
within
this
heart
o
mine
thy
heart
again
jocelyn
again
said
the
young
knight
wrinkling
slender
brows
aye
thou
sing
thy
heart
woe
to
me
not
so
long
since
in
an
hundred
and
seventy
and
eight
cantos
and
i
mind
thy
motto
nay
beltane
in
faith
indeed
these
were
folly
and
youthful
folly
the
tide
hath
ebbed
full
oft
since
then
and
i
being
older
am
wiser
love
hath
found
me
out
at
last
man
love
list
now
i
pray
thee
and
mark
me
friend
wounded
was
i
at
the
ford
you
wot
of
beside
the
mill
and
thereafter
lost
within
the
forest
a
woeful
wight
whereon
my
charger
curst
beast
did
run
off
and
leave
me
so
was
i
in
unholy
plight
when
whereas
i
lay
sighful
and
distressed
there
dawned
upon
my
sight
one
beyond
all
beauty
beautiful
in
ragged
garb
was
she
yet
by
her
loveliness
her
very
rags
were
glorified
to
me
shy
as
startled
doe
came
she
and
with
saintly
pity
sweet
did
tend
my
hurt
which
done
with
much
ado
she
did
hither
bring
me
each
day
at
morn
and
eve
came
she
with
cates
rare
and
delicate
and
her
gentle
hands
did
woo
my
wound
to
health
the
which
indeed
so
swift
grew
well
that
i
did
feign
divers
pains
betimes
lest
she
should
vanish
from
me
quite
so
grew
my
love
at
the
first
loved
i
her
something
basely
for
the
beauty
of
her
body
fair
whereat
she
grieved
and
sorrowed
and
fled
from
my
regard
and
for
an
eternity
of
days
came
not
again
until
and
beltane
though
base
her
birth
though
friendless
poor
and
lonely
yet
did
my
heart
know
her
far
my
base
self
for
worthiness
so
did
i
upon
my
knightly
word
pledge
her
my
troth
so
shall
she
be
henceforth
my
lady
of
alain
and
chatelaine
of
divers
goodly
castles
manors
and
demesnes
she
cometh
to
me
in
her
rags
and
we
set
forth
she
and
i
to
mortain
hand
in
hand
nor
shall
my
lips
touch
hers
beltane
until
holy
church
hath
made
us
one
how
think
ye
of
my
doing
friend
i
do
think
thee
true
and
worthy
knight
sir
jocelyn
and
moreover
but
of
a
sudden
roger
voice
reached
them
from
without
hoarse
with
terror
master
o
master
beware
is
the
witch
lord
o
beware
and
with
the
cry
lo
a
hurry
of
feet
running
swift
and
light
a
rustle
of
flying
garments
and
there
flushed
and
panting
stood
the
witch
the
witch
mellent
that
was
the
lady
winfrida
now
beholding
beltane
her
eyes
grew
wide
with
swift
and
sudden
fear
she
quailed
and
sank
to
her
knees
before
him
and
when
sir
jocelyn
smitten
to
mute
wonder
would
have
raised
her
she
brake
forth
into
bitter
weeping
and
crouched
away
nay
touch
me
not
my
lord
lest
thou
repent
hereafter
for
now
do
i
see
that
happiness
is
not
for
me
now
must
i
say
such
words
as
shall
slay
thy
love
for
me
so
touch
me
not
ha
never
say
so
cried
sir
jocelyn
not
touch
thee
art
not
mine
own
beloved
mellent
nay
i
am
the
lady
winfrida
thou
winfrida
the
rich
and
proud
in
these
rags
thou
winfrida
the
fair
thy
raven
hair
o
my
hair
my
lord
was
gold
is
black
and
shall
be
gold
again
but
i
am
that
same
winfrida
but
but
i
have
seen
winfrida
betimes
in
mortain
ere
now
nay
then
didst
but
look
at
her
my
lord
for
thine
eyes
saw
only
the
noble
helen
beauty
alas
that
ever
i
was
born
for
that
i
am
that
winfrida
who
for
ambition
sake
and
wicked
pride
did
a
most
vile
thing
o
my
lord
beltane
as
thou
art
strong
be
pitiful
as
thou
art
deeply
wronged
be
greatly
merciful
how
how
mean
you
said
beltane
and
breathing
deep
lord
was
i
o
how
may
i
tell
it
my
lord
beltane
upon
thy
wedding
night
did
i
with
traitorous
hand
infuse
a
potent
drug
within
the
whereby
our
lady
duchess
fell
into
a
swoon
nigh
unto
death
and
while
she
lay
thus
i
took
from
her
the
the
gown
of
blue
and
silver
thereafter
came
i
with
my
henchman
ulf
the
strong
and
found
thee
sleeping
in
the
chapel
so
ulf
at
my
command
smote
thee
and
bound
thee
fast
and
ere
the
dawn
i
brought
thee
to
garthlaxton
o
my
lord
thou
it
was
thou
i
do
confess
it
my
lord
beltane
traitor
to
thee
and
base
traitor
to
her
why
verily
here
was
treachery
quoth
beltane
speaking
slow
and
soft
truly
here
methinks
was
treachery
and
wherefore
o
my
lord
must
i
tell
this
i
do
ask
thee
then
did
winfrida
shrink
within
herself
and
crouched
yet
further
from
sir
jocelyn
as
though
his
eyes
had
hurt
her
lord
she
whispered
i
was
jealous
duke
ivo
wooed
me
long
ere
he
loved
the
duchess
helen
so
was
i
jealous
yet
was
i
proud
also
for
i
would
suffer
not
his
love
until
he
had
made
me
wife
and
upon
a
day
he
laughing
bade
me
bring
him
captive
this
mighty
man
that
defied
his
power
that
burned
gibbets
and
wrought
such
deeds
as
no
other
man
dared
swearing
that
an
i
did
so
he
would
wed
with
me
forthright
and
i
was
young
and
mad
with
jealousy
and
in
those
days
i
knew
love
not
at
all
but
o
upon
a
day
i
found
a
new
world
wherein
love
came
to
me
a
love
so
deep
and
high
so
pure
and
noble
that
fain
would
i
have
died
amid
the
flame
than
thus
speak
forth
my
shame
slaying
this
wondrous
love
by
my
unworthiness
yet
have
i
told
my
shame
and
love
is
dead
methinks
since
i
am
known
for
false
friend
and
traitor
vile
a
thing
for
scorn
henceforth
that
no
honourable
love
may
cleave
to
so
is
love
dead
and
fain
would
i
die
also
now
of
a
sudden
while
yet
beltane
frowned
down
upon
her
came
sir
jocelyn
and
kneeling
beside
winfrida
spake
with
bent
head
messire
beltane
thou
seest
before
thee
two
that
are
one
henceforth
so
do
i
beseech
thee
forgive
us
our
trespass
against
thee
an
it
may
be
so
but
if
thy
wrongs
are
beyond
forgiveness
then
will
we
die
together
o
jocelyn
cried
winfrida
breathlessly
o
dear
my
lord
surely
never
man
loved
like
thee
lord
beltane
forgive
for
this
noble
sake
forgive
the
sinful
winfrida
forgive
said
beltane
hoarsely
forgive
nay
rather
would
i
humbly
thank
thee
on
my
knees
for
thou
hast
given
back
the
noblest
part
of
me
she
that
was
lost
is
found
again
the
dead
doth
live
helen
is
her
noble
self
and
only
i
am
vile
that
could
have
doubted
her
the
happiest
man
the
proudest
and
the
most
woeful
i
in
all
the
world
methinks
o
kneel
not
to
me
and

do

world
but

the
greatest
thing
of

so
saying
beltane
turned
very
suddenly
and
strode
out
where
beside
the
great
horse
mars
stood
roger
very
pale
in
the
moonlight
and
starting
and
staring
at
every
rustling
leaf
and
patch
of
shadow
roger
said
he
thou
art
afraid
of
bats
and
owls
yet
forsooth
art
a
wiser
man
than
i
bring
hither
the
horse
in
a
while
cometh
sir
jocelyn
and
the
lady
winfrida
hand
in
hand
aglow
with
happiness
yet
with
eyes
moistly
bright
under
the
moon
good
quoth
beltane
mortain
lieth
far
hence
now

goodly
horse

cried
winfrida
shrinking

the
horse
that

gilles
of
brandonmere

the
lists
at
barham
broom
so

lady
winfrida

and

how

ye
messire

cried
sir
jocelyn
gleefully
beltane
o
dear
my
friend
doubt
me
not
i
do
tell
thee
we
shall
ride
together
yet
when
the
battle
joins
so
saying
be
sprang
to
saddle
now
turned
beltane
to
aid
the
lady
winfrida
to
sir
jocelyn
hold
but
even
then
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
catching
his
hand
to
her
bosom
kissed
it
lord
beltane
said
she
looking
up
glistening
lashes
as
thou
hast
dealt
with
me
so
may
heaven
deal
with
thee
may
thy
sore
heart
find
solace
until
love
find
thee
and
dear
my
lord
i
pray
you
where
is
he
the
young
knight
that
rode
with
thee
for
where
he
is
there
also
is
helen
and
thou
dost
know
too
i
knew
her
that
day
in
the
forest
when
i
fled
away
for
though
i
would
have
confessed
my
sin
to
thee
yet
her
cold
scorn
i
could
not
have
borne
where
is
she
now
my
lord
safe
within
mortain
i
pray
then
come
you
to
mortain
come
with
us
this
night
ah
come
you
to
mortain
and
helen
now
hereupon
beltane
turned
to
look
with
yearning
eyes
towards
the
gloom
of
the
forest
beyond
which
lay
the
soft
and
peaceful
valleys
of
fair
mortain
and
she
that
called
herself
fidelis
who
had
indeed
been
so
faithful
in
all
things
so
patient
and
enduring
and
as
his
eyes
yearned
so
yearned
the
great
passionate
soul
of
him
insomuch
that
he
must
needs
fall
whereat
roger
the
watchful
drew
a
soft
pace
nearer
so
stood
beltane
awhile
hands
clenched
head
bent
staring
ever
northwards
his
blood
aglow
with
eager
love
his
heart
with
passionate
remorse
come
my
lord
breathed
winfrida
o
come
in
mortain
is
rest
and
solace
and
love
rest
said
beltane
softly
solace
and
love
o
sweet
thought
yet
i
may
not
go
hence
for
here
is
sorrow
and
shame
and
suffering
sword
and
fire
and
battle
so
must
i
bide
here
in
pentavalon
with
my
duty
so
saying
he
lifted
winfrida
to
sir
jocelyn
ready
clasp
and
thereafter
spake
with
head
downbent
an
thou
chance
to
see
her
within
mortain
i
pray
you
say
that
the
blind
doth
see
at
last
and
is
gone
to
his
duty
that
peradventure
he
may
be
some
day
more
worthy
her
great
love
and
now
fare
ye
well
good
friends
god
have
ye
ever
in
his
tender
care
come
roger
then
beltane
turned
him
suddenly
away
and
with
broad
back
set
towards
mortain
strode
off
across
the
desolate
moor
chapter
l
telleth
how
beltane
went
forth
to
his
duty
silent
went
beltane
his
lips
his
wistful
eyes
staring
ever
before
him
nor
paused
he
once
nor
once
glanced
back
towards
that
happy
mortain
which
held
for
him
all
that
was
fair
and
sweet
and
noble
that
pure
and
faithful
heart
wherein
no
evil
could
exist
that
radiant
body
in
whose
soft
white
loveliness
lay
all
the
joy
all
the
happiness
the
wide
world
might
ever
yield
him
and
now
because
of
her
proved
innocence
he
was
uplifted
by
a
great
and
mighty
joy
and
therewith
his
step
was
light
and
swift
anon
because
of
his
base
doubt
of
her
he
writhed
the
tooth
of
bitter
remorse
and
therewith
his
step
grew
heavy
and
slow
now
was
he
proud
of
her
so
great
love
for
him
and
again
he
knew
a
profound
and
deep
humility
because
of
his
so
great
unworthiness
thus
went
he
nothing
speaking
now
with
flying
feet
now
with
steps
that
dragged
insomuch
that
watchful
roger
fell
to
solemn
wonderment
to
a
furtive
unease
and
so
at
last
to
speech
lord
quoth
he
in
a
voice
of
awe
but
beltane
strode
on
unheeding
whereat
roger
eyes
grew
round
and
his
ruddy
cheek
pale
and
clenching
his
fist
he
raised
aloft
his
first
and
little
fingers
so
that
they
formed
two
horns
and
with
the
horns
he
touched
beltane
lightly
on
the
shoulder
master
said
he
then
beltane
started
and
turning
looked
at
roger
whereupon
roger
immediately
crossed
his
fingers
ha
roger
i
was
deep
in
my
thoughts
what
would
ye
master
hast
ever
a
pricking
in
the
hairs
of
thy
head
not
i
dost
ever
feel
a
tingling
in
the
soles
of
thy
feet
not
so
in
truth
why
then
a
shivering
quaking
o
the
roger
man
what
troubles
thee
now
i
do
fear
and
master
why
so
betimes
thou
dost
smile
upon
the
moon
for
no
reason
scowl
upon
the
earth
for
no
reason
work
with
thy
lips
yet
speak
no
word
and
therewith
do
bite
thy
clench
thy
fists
and
all
for
no
reason
moreover
quick
and
slow
in
thy
gait
sighing
gustily
off
and
on
so
it
is
i
do
sweat
for
thee
and
wherefore
master
quoth
roger
glancing
furtively
about
in
my
youth
i
did
see
a
goodly
man
by
horrid
spells
by
an
ancient
hag
that
was
a
noted
witch
and
he
acted
thus
a
poor
wight
that
was
thereafter
damnably
into
a
small
black
rabbit
see
you
saw
you
all
this
indeed
roger
all
but
the
master
for
being
young
and
sore
frighted
i
ran
away
and
hid
myself
but
afterwards
saw
i
the
old
woman
with
the
black
rabbit
in
a
cage
wherefore
the
vile
hag
was
stoned
to
death
and
the
black
rabbit
that
was
her
familiar
also
and
very
properly
and
lord
because
i
do
love
thee
rather
would
i
see
thee
dead
than
a
rabbit
or
a
toad
or
lewd
cur
wherefore
now
i
pray
thee
cross
thy
fingers
and
repeat
after
me
nay
my
faithful
roger
never
fear
here
is
no
witchcraft
is
but
that
within
the
hour
the
blind
doth
see
the
fool
hath
got
him
some
little
wisdom
master
how
mean
you
this
night
roger
i
have
learned
this
great
truth
that
white
can
never
be
black
nor
day
night
nor
truth
lie
and
here
is
great
matter
for
thought
wherefore
as
i
walk
i
think
now
hereupon
black
roger
halted
and
looked
upon
beltane
lord
he
cried
is
it
that
ye
do
know
the
very
truth
at
last
of
sir
fidelis
that
glorious
lady
thy
duchess
helen
aye
the
very
truth
at
last
roger
ha
is
so
i
petitioned
the
good
saint
cuthbert
this
very
night
and
lo
he
hath
answered
thy
prayer
roger
verily
he
regardeth
poor
roger
these
days
master
though
my
belt
doth
yet
bear
many
accursed
notches
they
shall
be
fewer
anon
roger
there
be
many
poor
souls
for
thee
to
save
in
woeful
pentavalon
hereafter
went
they
a
while
in
silence
until
of
a
sudden
roger
halted
and
clapped
hand
to
thigh
master
we
go
the
wrong
way
methinks
not
so
we
be
close
upon
the
forest
road
roger
but
thou
dost
know
her
faithful
master
pure
and
holy
in
mind
and
body
at
sure
of
this
at
last
aye
sighed
beltane
at
last
why
then
lord
let
us
incontinent
seek
her
out
she
is
in
for
mortain
roger
moreover
nay
master
forsooth
she
is
hum
aye
she
in
mortain
mayhap
but
none
so
far
to
mortain
for
such
legs
as
thine
and
mine
and
belike
we
may
chance
upon
her
by
the
way
or
or
she
with
us
or
both
even
so
needs
must
i
to
my
duty
thy
duty
aye
master
thy
duty
is
to
woo
her
wed
her
take
her
to
thy
arms
and
i
tell
thee
roger
will
i
speak
word
of
love
to
her
until
i
have
proved
myself
in
some
sense
fit
and
worthy
first
will
i
free
pentavalon
as
i
did
swear
nay
master
wed
first
thy
duchess
so
shall
she
aid
thee
in
thy
vows
and
thereafter
enough
cried
beltane
think
ye
is
so
easy
to
thus
gainsay
the
love
that
burns
me
but
shame
were
it
that
i
beggared
in
fortune
my
friends
few
should
wed
her
in
my
dire
need
dragging
thereby
peaceful
mortain
to
mine
aid
and
the
bloody
arbitrament
of
battle
moreover
hast
forgot
the
oath
i
sware
that
nought
henceforth
should
let
or
stay
me
master
sighed
roger
there
be
times
methinks
thou
dost
swear
oaths
art
man
and
woman
full
of
youth
and
love
wherefore
not
marry
wherefore
heed
a
vow
here
or
there
needs
must
i
wrestle
with
the
good
saint
cuthbert
in
the
matter
but
here
beltane
fell
again
to
meditation
and
roger
likewise
so
came
they
presently
to
the
and
turning
north
towards
winisfarne
they
strode
on
side
by
side
in
silence
profound
and
deep
and
of
a
sudden
upon
this
silence
rose
a
voice
and
quavering
o
ye
that
have
eyes
have
pity
show
mercy
on
one
that
is
maimed
and
helpless
and
creepeth
ever
in
the
dark
chapter
li
how
black
roger
won
to
fuller
manhood
forthwith
beltane
paused
and
presently
beheld
one
that
sat
by
the
wayside
a
man
who
crouched
a
dusty
cloak
and
kept
his
white
head
and
who
now
reached
out
a
hand
to
grope
and
grope
for
the
staff
that
lay
near
wherefore
beltane
took
hold
upon
this
hand
and
raised
the
traveller
and
thereafter
put
the
cudgel
in
his
grasp
messire
said
the
blind
man
though
i
have
no
eyes
i
do
know
thee
young
for
thy
clasp
is
strong
and
quick
with
life
yet
wondrous
gentle
god
bless
thee
youthful
sir
for
is
well
to
meet
with
gentleness
within
a
world
so
cruel
tell
me
i
pray
doth
this
road
lead
unto
belsaye
town
verily
answered
beltane
but
is
a
long
day
march
thither
yet
needs
must
i
reach
there
since
i
do
bear
a
message
but
o
young
messire
when
cruel
men
put
out
mine
eyes
the
good
god
in
his
sweet
clemency
made
sharp
mine
ears
so
do
i
know
thy
voice
methinks
for
voice
of
one
who
long
months
since
did
cherish
me
in
my
need
and
hunger
and
sent
me
unto
the
saintly
ambrose
ha
cried
beltane
joyously
and
is
it
thou
indeed
tell
me
how
doth
my
father
is
he
well
what
said
he
how
looked
he
o
i
do
yearn
for
word
of
him
thy
father
how
young
sir
is
he
indeed
thy
father
then
is
thy
name
beltane
for
i
have
heard
him
name
thee
oft
forsooth
and
did
he
so
but
how
came
you
here
and
wherefore
to
seek
thee
lord
beltane
according
to
thy
saintly
father
word
and
the
manner
of
it
thus
as
we
sat
together
of
a
certain
fair
noon
within
holy
cross
thicket
there
came
to
us
thither
a
woman
young
methinks
and
fair
for
her
speech
was
soft
and
wondrous
sweet
in
mine
ears
and
she
did
hail
thy
father
and
thereafter
spake
thy
name
full
oft
and
so
they
fell
to
many
words
walking
together
up
and
down
before
the
hut
anon
sudden
and
silent
as
she
came
she
was
gone
and
thy
father
walked
full
long
praying
oft
as
one
that
rejoiceth
greatly
and
oft
as
one
in
deep
perplexity
in
a
while
cometh
he
to
me
and
gave
me
scrip
and
therewith
food
and
money
and
bade
me
seek
thee
in
belsaye
and
speak
thee
thus
beltane
my
that
i
his
father
have
heard
of
his
great
and
knightly
deeds
and
that
i
do
glory
in
them
praising
god
say
that
through
him
my
youth
and
strength
are
renewed
and
my
great
sin
made
easier
to
bear
tell
him
that
the
woes
of
pentavalon
draw
to
an
end
and
that
ere
long
she
shall
arise
above
her
sorrows
bid
him
be
of
good
courage
yet
a
little
longer
for
the
lion
is
waked
at
last
and
the
leopard
also
behold
now
messire
said
and
the
blind
man
stood
with
head
one
hand
grasping
the
staff
his
other
arm
hid
within
his
wide
sleeve
what
time
roger
watched
him
furtive
and
askance
and
moreover
his
shook
and
quivered
in
his
grasp
as
for
beltane
he
stood
as
one
lost
in
happy
thought
upon
his
lips
a
smile
ineffably
tender
smiling
yet
he
turned
and
touched
the
blind
man
stooping
shoulder
quoth
he
greatly
welcome
is
thy
news
and
greatly
would
i
thank
thee
pray
you
now
how
may
i
show
my
gratitude
messire
fain
would
i
shelter
me
in
belsaye
for
there
is
fire
and
sword
and
battle
on
the
marches
but
the
way
is
long
and
on
my
road
hither
two
rogues
took
from
me
purse
and
scrip
give
me
therefore
enough
to
bear
me
on
my
way
aye
verily
roger
thou
dost
bear
the
purse
give
him
store
of
money
and
some
of
our
food
see
that
he
lacketh
for
nothing
roger
so
saying
beltane
turned
him
away
and
fell
again
to
pondering
his
father
words
now
at
sound
of
roger
name
the
blind
man
started
round
and
fixed
roger
with
the
horror
of
his
eyeless
sockets
and
therewith
flung
up
an
arm
as
though
fearing
a
blow
and
behold
this
arm
was
but
a
mutilated
stump
for
hand
was
there
none
roger
he
whispered
not
roger
the
black
no
no
there
be
a
many
rogers
but
who
art
thou
dost
bear
such
a
name
and
wherefore
cower
and
gasp
ye
then
stood
the
blind
man
with
head
and
awful
arm
upraised
before
which
black
roger
shrank
and
shrank
to
cower
in
the
deeper
shadow
of
a
sudden
the
blind
man
turned
and
coming
beside
beltane
grasped
him
by
the
mantle
lord
he
questioned
who
is
he
that
trembleth
before
the
maimed
and
blind
who
is
he
that
croucheth
yonder
nay
fear
ye
nothing
said
beltane
is
none
but
my
trusty
roger
my
good
comrade
in
arms
comfort
ye
then
he
beckoned
roger
and
took
the
purse
and
gave
to
the
blind
man
bounteously
saying
see
now
when
you
shall
come
to
belsaye
go
you
to
eric
that
hath
command
of
the
town
and
to
giles
that
is
captain
of
the
archers
and
say
that
i
beltane
will
come
to
belsaye
within
the
week
and
all
our
company
with
me
god
willing
bid
them
be
vigilant
and
watch
for
our
coming
let
bows
be
strung
and
wall
and
turret
manned
night
and
day
so
now
fare
thee
well
and
god
hand
guide
thy
sightless
going
then
the
blind
man
blessed
beltane
and
turning
forthwith
set
out
upon
his
way
and
his
staff
tapped
loud
upon
the
right
joyfully
beltane
strode
on
again
his
mind
ever
busied
with
thought
of
his
father
but
roger
step
was
listless
and
heavy
so
that
beltane
must
needs
turn
to
look
on
him
and
straightway
marvelled
to
see
how
he
hung
his
head
and
that
his
ruddy
cheek
was
grown
wondrous
pale
and
haggard
roger
quoth
he
art
sick
roger
sick
lord
nay
not
sick
is
but
that
i
i
but
when
he
would
have
said
more
his
voice
failed
him
his
lip
fell
and
even
as
beltane
stared
in
wonder
black
roger
groaned
and
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
within
his
hands
why
roger
what
ails
thee
roger
man
said
beltane
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
whereat
roger
groaned
again
and
shrank
away
ah
lord
touch
me
not
he
cried
unfit
am
i
for
hand
of
thine
unfit
and
all
unworthy
nay
good
friend
master
master
groaned
roger
and
therewith
a
great
cry
brake
from
him
and
he
cast
himself
face
downwards
in
the
dust
unworthy
am
i
to
be
thy
man
so
must
i
leave
thee
this
night
aye
leave
thee
for
o
my
lord
yon
poor
blind
man
was
i
at
the
red
pertolepe
command
i
did
burn
out
his
eyes
and
cut
off
his
hand
was
i
i
black
roger
o
saint
cuthbert
o
sweet
jesu
so
all
unworthy
am
i
to
be
thy
man
and
now
great
sobs
shook
him
fierce
sobs
and
bitter
and
he
writhed
there
in
the
dust
groaning
in
the
agony
of
his
remorse
little
by
little
his
passion
spent
itself
but
still
he
lay
there
yearning
mightily
for
sound
of
his
master
voice
or
touch
of
his
hand
yet
dared
he
not
look
up
because
of
his
abasement
at
last
whenas
his
sobs
had
ceased
he
lifted
his
wretched
head
and
stared
in
wonder
to
see
beltane
upon
his
knees
his
mailed
hands
clasped
and
his
lips
moving
in
silent
prayer
when
his
prayer
ended
he
raised
his
head
and
straightway
roger
wonder
grew
for
behold
the
eyes
of
beltane
were
wondrous
gentle
his
mouth
and
tender
the
old
harsh
lines
of
lip
and
lowering
brow
had
vanished
quite
and
thus
at
last
black
roger
saw
again
the
face
of
my
beltane
that
had
smiled
on
him
long
since
amid
the
green
across
the
prostrate
form
of
poor
beda
the
jester
so
now
my
beltane
smiled
and
smiling
reached
forth
his
hand
roger
said
he
by
shame
and
agony
some
men
do
win
to
new
life
and
fuller
manhood
and
such
a
man
methinks
thou
art
so
hath
god
need
of
thee
and
from
this
the
dust
of
thy
abasement
mayhap
shall
lift
thee
one
day
high
as
heaven
stand
up
roger
good
my
friend
stand
up
o
man
for
he
only
is
unworthy
that
hath
wept
remorseful
in
the
dust
for
evil
past
and
done
then
roger
grasped
that
strong
uplifting
hand
and
stood
upon
his
feet
yet
spake
he
no
word
and
presently
they
went
on
along
the
road
together
and
roger
habit
was
stained
with
dust
and
on
his
cheek
the
mark
of
bitter
tears
but
his
head
was
high
and
manfully
uplifted
chapter
lii
how
they
had
news
of
walkyn
now
went
they
in
silence
again
for
that
beltane
dreamed
of
many
things
while
roger
marvelled
within
himself
oft
turning
to
look
on
my
beltane
radiant
face
while
ever
his
wonder
grew
so
oft
did
he
turn
thus
to
gape
and
stare
that
beltane
chancing
to
meet
his
look
smiled
and
questioned
him
thus
why
gape
ye
on
me
so
roger
man
for
wonder
master
wherefore
to
see
thee
so
suddenly
thyself
again
truly
saint
cuthbert
is
a
potent
saint
and
thou
a
sturdy
good
roger
and
most
vile
sinner
lord
howbeit
i
have
dared
supplicate
on
thy
behalf
and
behold
thou
art
indeed
thyself
again
that
same
sweet
and
gentle
youth
that
smote
me
on
my
knavish
mazzard
with
thy
stout
in
shevening
thicket
in
the
matter
of
beda
red
pertolepe
fool
a
dour
ding
yon
master
forsooth
a
woundy
rap
now
fell
they
to
thoughtful
silence
again
but
oft
black
roger
stride
waxed
uneven
and
oft
he
stumbled
in
his
going
wherefore
beltane
slackened
his
pace
what
is
it
roger
naught
but
my
legs
master
heed
not
thy
legs
they
be
shorter
than
thine
lord
and
love
not
to
wag
so
fast
an
thou
abate
thy
speed
a
little
a
very
little
master
they
shall
thank
thee
dearly
art
so
weary
roger
master
i
was
afoot
ere
sunrise
why
truly
roger
yet
do
i
to
mine
own
selfish
ends
keep
thee
from
thy
slumber
thus
verily
a
selfish
man
i
not
so
master
indeed
so
now
will
we
halt
and
thou
shalt
to
thy
rest
why
then
lord
let
us
to
the
hollow
it
lieth
scarce
a
mile
through
the
brush
yonder
and
was
there
i
did
appoint
for
walkyn
to
meet
with
thee
again
so
shall
we
sleep
secure
moreover
i
have
a
feeling
as
it
were
one
calling
us
thither
a
wondrous
strange
feeling
master
mayhap
we
shall
come
by
news
of
walkyn
there
is
well
bethought
roger
come
thy
ways
forthwith
turned
they
from
the
and
forcing
their
way
through
a
leafy
tangle
presently
came
out
into
a
ride
or
narrow
glade
but
they
had
gone
only
a
very
little
distance
when
they
espied
the
red
glow
of
a
fire
within
a
thicket
hard
by
and
therewith
the
sound
of
voices
reached
them
three
great
bags
i
tell
thee
cried
one
voice
high
and
querulous
three
great
fair
and
goodly
bags
full
crammed
of
sweet
gold
pieces
all
my
lord
duke
revenue
of
winisfarne
and
the
villages
adjacent
thereunto
taxes
see
ye
my
lord
duke
taxes
and
all
stolen
reft
and
ravished
from
me
guido
steward
and
bailiff
of
the
northern
marches
by
and
raveners
lewd
and
damned
woe
me
for
my
lord
good
o
content
thee
spake
another
voice
sleepy
and
for
an
these
monies
were
the
duke
they
were
not
thine
and
if
they
were
not
thine
thou
wert
not
robbed
and
since
thou
wert
not
robbed
wherefore
groan
and
glower
ye
on
the
moon
moreover
thou
hast
yet
certain
monies
thou
didst
collect
from
yon
blind
fellow
the
which
remindeth
me
i
have
not
yet
my
share
so
pray
thee
now
disburse
good
steward
hereupon
ere
beltane
could
stay
him
roger
slipped
into
the
undergrowth
upon
whose
vanishing
the
air
grew
very
suddenly
full
of
shouts
and
cries
of
scuffling
sounds
and
woeful
pleadings
and
striding
forward
beltane
beheld
two
men
that
crouched
on
bended
knees
while
roger
fierce
and
threatening
stood
betwixt
a
hairy
hand
upon
the
throat
of
each
now
beholding
beltane
they
these
gasping
rogues
incontinent
beset
him
with
whimpering
entreaties
beseeching
of
him
their
lives
ragged
knaves
they
seemed
and
in
woeful
plight
the
one
a
lank
fellow
and
saturnine
with
long
hungry
nose
the
other
a
little
man
plump
and
buxom
whose
round
eyes
blinked
woefully
in
his
round
and
rosy
face
as
he
bent
roger
heavy
hand
yet
spake
he
to
beltane
in
soft
and
soothing
accents
on
this
wise
resplendent
sir
behold
this
thy
most
officious
wight
who
doth
my
tender
throat
with
hurtful
hand
encompass
doubtless
to
some
wise
and
gracious
end
an
he
doth
squeeze
me
thus
at
thy
command
yet
noble
sir
humbly
would
i
woo
of
thee
the
mercy
of
a
little
more
air
lest
this
right
noble
youth
do
choke
me
quite
but
hereupon
the
lank
fellow
cried
out
bold
and
querulous
take
ye
heed
for
whoso
dareth
lay
hand
on
me
toucheth
the
person
of
duke
ivo
puissant
self
ha
say
ye
so
growled
roger
and
forthwith
squeezed
him
until
he
gasped
again
loose
me
knave
he
panted
duke
ivo
steward
i
bailiff
of
the
northern
marches
with
towns
and
villages
adjacent
thereunto
unhand
them
roger
said
beltane
entreat
them
gently
in
especial
my
lord
duke
steward
and
bailiff
of
the
marches
if
so
he
be
in
very
truth
yea
my
lord
in
very
truth
cried
the
bailiff
but
two
days
since
in
ermined
robe
and
chain
of
office
a
notable
man
i
courted
by
many
feared
by
more
right
well
by
all
with
goodly
horse
betwixt
my
knees
and
lusty
at
my
beck
and
call
alas
and
woe
thou
me
a
ragged
loon
a
sorry
wight
the
meanest
rogue
would
scorn
to
bow
to
and
the
very
children
jeer
at
and
all
by
reason
of
a
lewd
that
doth
flourish
him
a
mighty
axe
o
a
vile
seditious
fellow
ripe
for
the
gallows
ah
with
an
axe
thou
sir
bailiff
o
most
infallibly
an
axe
messire
a
ponderous
axe
with
haft
the
length
of
this
my
leg
a
vilely
tall
base
and
most
unseemly
dog
that
hath
spoiled
me
of
my
lord
sweet
wherefore
i
yearn
to
see
him
wriggle
in
a
noose
to
the
which
end
i
journey
in
these
my
rags
unto
my
lord
duke
on
barham
broom
with
tale
of
wrong
and
outrage
most
abominable
and
dared
they
rob
thee
indeed
quoth
beltane
and
thou
my
lord
duke
high
steward
and
bailiff
of
the
marches
come
sit
ye
down
and
tell
me
of
the
matter
and
roger
methinks
he
shall
talk
the
better
an
thou
keep
thy
fingers
farther
from
his
so
down
sat
they
together
round
the
fire
and
what
time
the
little
buxom
man
viewed
beltane
stealthy
lids
from
golden
spur
to
open
bascinet
the
bailiff
fell
to
his
tale
as
followeth
know
then
good
and
noble
sir
knight
that
i
sat
me
but
two
days
since
in
right
fair
and
goodly
estate
my
lackeys
to
hand
my
at
my
back
twenty
tall
fellows
i
sat
me
thus
i
say
within
the
square
at
winisfarne
whither
by
sound
of
trumpet
i
had
summoned
me
the
knavish
townsfolk
to
pay
into
my
hand
my
lord
duke
rightful
dues
and
taxes
which
folk
it
is
my
custom
to
call
upon
by
name
and
one
by
one
when
lo
of
a
sudden
and
all
uncalled
comes
me
a
great
tall
fellow
this
same
knave
and
forthwith
seized
him
one
of
my
lord
great
and
when
i
would
have
denied
him
set
me
his
axe
beneath
my
very
nose
thereafter
took
he
the
bags
all
three
and
scattered
o
hateful
hateful
sight
my
lord
good
monies
among
the
base
rabblement
and
when
my
lusty
fellows
sought
to
apprehend
me
this
rogue
he
smote
them
dolefully
and
roared
in
hideous
fashion
pentavalon
and
straightway
at
this
lewd
shout
forth
of
the
crowd
leapt
many
other
rogues
bedight
as
gentle
knights
in
noble
mail
and
fell
upon
us
and
smote
us
dire
and
stripped
me
of
my
goodly
apparel
and
drave
me
forth
of
the
town
with
stripes
and
blows
and
laughter
most
ungentle
so
here
sit
i
poor
guido
steward
and
bailiff
of
the
marches
in
most
vile
estate
very
full
of
woe
yet
alack
empty
of
belly
but
says
beltane
shaking
his
head
within
thy
pouch
methinks
a
blind
man
money
how
a
blind
man
gasped
the
bailiff
a
blind
man
monies
thou
nay
messire
in
very
truth
search
him
roger
hereupon
roger
having
straightway
choked
him
to
silence
with
the
one
hand
full
soon
had
found
the
money
with
the
other
and
thereafter
he
loosed
the
bailiff
that
he
might
get
his
breath
again
the
which
he
no
sooner
had
done
than
he
fell
to
prayers
and
humble
entreaties
sir
knight
right
noble
sir
sure
thou
wilt
not
take
thus
from
a
woeful
wight
all
that
he
hath
nay
answered
beltane
i
take
only
from
my
lord
duke
steward
and
bailiff
of
the
marches
and
now
said
he
turning
upon
the
small
round
man
thou
hast
marked
me
well
how
say
you
pardoner
first
most
truly
potent
wise
yet
very
youthful
noble
sir
that
for
all
the
world
and
all
the
glory
thereof
i
would
not
anger
thee
hast
good
eyes
pardoner
and
art
quick
to
heed
nay
dull
am
i
sweet
lord
aye
dull
forsooth
and
slow
beyond
belief
know
me
again
bear
my
likeness
in
thy
memory
never
lord
never
o
never
i
swear
it
by
the
toe
of
the
blessed
didymus
by
the
arm
of
saint
amphibalus
thrice
blessed
by
why
then
pardoner
behold
here
my
belt
of
silver
my
good
sword
and
here
behold
my
yellow
hair
and
off
came
bascinet
and
back
fell
whereat
the
bailiff
started
and
caught
his
breath
and
stared
on
beltane
in
sudden
awe
dost
mark
me
well
pardoner
aye
noble
sir
verily
and
in
truth
do
i
so
next
time
i
think
on
thee
thou
wilt
be
a
squat
man
and
for
my
lord
a
poor
pardoner
i
but
nought
beside
then
beltane
did
on
coif
and
bascinet
and
rose
to
his
feet
whereat
the
bailiff
cried
out
in
sudden
fear
and
knelt
with
hands
upraised
slay
me
not
my
lord
o
messire
beltane
spare
my
life
nor
think
i
will
betray
thee
outlaw
though
thou
art
fear
not
sir
bailiff
answered
beltane
thy
life
is
safe
from
me
but
when
thou
dost
name
me
to
thy
lord
duke
ivo
tell
him
that
i
spake
thee
this
that
whiles
i
do
lie
within
the
green
he
shall
not
sleep
o
nights
but
i
will
be
at
work
with
fire
and
steel
nor
rest
nor
stay
until
he
and
the
evil
of
him
be
purged
from
this
my
father
duchy
of
pentavalon
say
i
bid
him
remember
this
upon
his
pillow
tell
him
that
whiles
i
do
hold
the
woods
my
powers
grow
daily
and
so
will
i
storm
and
burn
his
castles
one
by
one
as
i
did
burn
garthlaxton
say
i
bid
him
to
think
upon
these
things
what
time
he
wooeth
slumber
in
the
night
as
to
thee
thou
wily
pardoner
when
thou
shalt
come
to
betray
this
our
meeting
say
that
i
told
thee
that
as
belsaye
rose
and
winisfarne
so
shall
town
and
village
rise
until
ivo
and
his
like
are
driven
hence
or
beltane
slain
and
made
an
end
of
and
so
fare
ye
well
come
roger
then
beltane
strode
away
with
grim
roger
at
his
heels
what
time
the
bailiff
and
the
pardoner
stared
in
dumb
amaze
here
quoth
the
pardoner
at
last
stroking
his
round
chin
here
was
a
man
methinks
wherefore
are
we
yet
alive
here
quoth
the
bailiff
scratching
his
long
nose
here
was
a
fool
methinks
for
that
we
are
alive
a
traitor
see
ye
pardoner
whose
yellow
head
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
truly
truly
here
was
a
very
fool
so
saying
he
arose
albeit
furtively
and
slipping
forthwith
into
the
shadow
crept
furtively
away
until
the
was
lost
and
hidden
far
behind
him
then
very
suddenly
he
betook
him
to
his
heels
and
coming
to
the
fled
southwards
towards
duke
ivo
great
camp
that
lay
on
barham
broom
chapter
liii
of
jolette
that
was
a
witch
lord
said
roger
shaking
his
head
as
they
halted
upon
the
edge
of
the
hollow
lord
better
thou
hadst
let
me
strangle
them
those
dogs
will
bay
of
thee
to
black
ivo
ere
this
time
is
so
i
hope
roger
hope
could
i
but
lure
black
ivo
into
the
wild
roger
where
swamp
and
thicket
should
fight
for
us
could
i
but
draw
him
hither
after
me
of
what
avail
the
might
of
his
heavy
chivalry
upon
this
narrow
his
a
sure
mark
for
the
arrows
of
our
foresters
thus
our
pikes
in
front
a
charge
in
flank
his
line
once
pierced
needs
must
follow
confusion
and
disorder
then
press
we
where
his
banner
flieth
and
hemmed
in
by
our
pikes
and
gisarms
and
giles
bowmen
he
once
our
prisoner
or
slain
his
great
army
would
crumble
and
melt
away
since
they
do
serve
but
for
base
hire
whiles
we
though
few
do
smite
amain
for
home
and
children
o
roger
man
could
i
but
lure
him
into
the
green
yet
methinks
there
is
a
surer
way
master
how
as
how
roger
wed
thou
thy
duchess
and
so
bring
down
on
him
all
the
powers
of
mortain
roger
dost
well
know
my
mind
on
this
matter
prate
ye
no
more
then
will
i
pray
master
so
i
do
warn
thee
forsooth
i
will
this
night
fall
to
work
upon
the
good
saint
and
plague
him
right
prayerfully
that
thy
duchess
may
come
and
save
thee
and
thy
duchy
in
despite
of
thee
and
having
made
thee
duke
of
pentavalon
with
her
lances
thereafter
make
thee
duke
of
mortain
in
her
own
sweet
body
for
as
i
do
know
but
beltane
was
already
descending
the
steep
path
leading
down
into
the
great
green
hollow
that
lay
all
silent
and
deserted
the
ghostly
moon
where
nought
stirred
in
the
windless
air
where
bush
and
tree
cast
shadows
monstrous
and
distorted
and
where
no
sound
brake
the
brooding
quiet
save
the
murmurous
ripple
of
the
brook
that
flowed
to
lose
itself
in
the
gloomy
waters
of
that
deep
and
sullen
pool
swift
and
as
only
foresters
might
they
descended
the
steep
and
lured
by
some
elfin
fancy
beltane
must
needs
come
to
stand
beside
the
pool
and
to
stare
down
into
those
silent
waters
very
dark
by
reason
of
that
great
tree
whose
writhen
branches
tostig
the
outlaw
had
fought
and
died
so
stood
beltane
awhile
lost
in
contemplation
what
time
roger
drawing
ever
nearer
his
master
elbow
shivered
and
crossed
himself
full
oft
come
away
master
said
he
at
last
i
love
not
this
pool
at
any
time
more
especially
at
the
full
o
the
moon
on
such
nights
ghosts
do
walk
tostig
was
an
ill
man
in
life
but
tostig
ghost
should
be
a
thing
to
fright
the
boldest
prithee
come
away
go
get
thee
to
thy
rest
roger
as
for
me
i
would
fain
think
but
wherefore
here
for
that
i
am
so
minded
so
be
it
master
god
send
thy
thoughts
be
fair
so
saying
roger
turned
where
on
the
further
side
of
the
hollow
lay
those
caves
the
rocky
bank
wherein
the
outlaws
had
been
wont
to
sleep
but
of
a
sudden
beltane
heard
a
hoarse
scream
a
gasp
of
terror
and
roger
was
back
beside
him
his
naked
all
in
his
trembling
hand
his
eyes
wide
and
rolling
master
o
master
he
whimpered
ghosts
the
tree
tostig
the
dead
hand
nay
what
folly
is
here
roger
lord
was
the
dead
hand
touched
me
on
the
brow
in
the
shadow
yonder
aye
on
the
brow
the
tree
o
master
dead
men
are
we
tostig
come
to
drag
us
back
to
hell
with
him
and
crouching
on
his
knees
roger
fell
to
desperate
prayers
then
beltane
turned
whither
roger
shaking
finger
had
pointed
and
strode
beneath
the
great
tree
and
peering
up
through
the
dark
he
presently
espied
a
shadowy
thing
that
moved
amid
a
gloom
of
leaves
and
branches
and
beholding
what
it
was
he
drew
sword
and
smote
high
above
his
head
something
thudded
heavily
upon
the
grass
and
lay
there
mute
and
rigid
while
beltane
leaning
upon
his
sword
stared
down
at
that
fell
shape
and
breathing
the
noxious
reek
of
it
was
seized
of
trembling
horror
nevertheless
he
stooped
and
reaching
out
a
hand
of
loathing
in
the
dimness
found
the
cord
whereby
it
had
swung
and
dragged
the
rigid
weighty
thing
out
into
the
radiance
of
the
moon
until
he
could
see
a
pallid
face
twisted
and
distorted
by
sharp
and
cruel
death
now
in
this
moment
roger
sware
a
fierce
great
oath
and
forthwith
kicked
those
stiffened
limbs
ha
cried
he
methought
was
tostig
his
ghost
come
for
to
drag
us
down
into
yon
accursed
pool
and
is
naught
but
the
gurth
and
dead
roger
forsooth
he
dead
enough
master
faugh
and
it
availeth
nothing
to
kick
a
dead
man
roger
yet
was
he
an
arrant
knave
master
and
hath
paid
for
his
knavery
methinks
a
very
rogue
a
traitor
a
rogue
of
rogues
master
then
hath
he
the
more
need
of
our
prayers
roger
prayers
how
lord
pray
for
this
nay
roger
but
thou
shalt
since
thou
art
potent
in
prayer
these
days
so
saying
beltane
knelt
upon
the
sward
and
folded
reverent
hands
whereupon
roger
somewhat
abashed
having
set
his
sword
upright
in
the
ling
as
was
his
custom
presently
knelt
likewise
and
clearing
his
throat
spake
aloud
in
this
fashion
holy
saint
cuthbert
thou
here
all
that
is
left
of
one
that
in
life
was
a
filthy
lewd
and
traitorous
knave
insomuch
that
he
hath
methinks
died
of
roguery
now
most
blessed
saint
do
thy
best
for
the
knavish
soul
of
him
intercede
on
his
behalf
that
he
may
suffer
no
more
than
he
should
and
this
is
the
prayer
of
me
black
roger
that
has
been
a
vile
sinner
as
i
have
told
thee
though
traitor
to
no
man
i
praise
god
but
most
blessed
and
right
potent
saint
while
i
am
at
the
ears
of
thee
fain
would
i
crave
thy
aid
on
matter
of
vasty
weight
and
import
to
wit
good
saint
let
now
sir
fidelis
who
as
ye
well
know
doth
hide
womanly
beauties
in
ungentle
steel
let
now
this
brave
and
noble
lady
muster
forthwith
all
the
powers
within
her
duchy
of
mortain
every
lusty
fellow
good
saint
and
hither
march
them
to
my
aid
let
her
smite
and
utterly
confound
black
ivo
who
as
oft
told
thee
moreover
thine
eyes
are
sharp
is
but
a
rogue
fitter
for
gallows
than
ducal
crown
even
as
this
most
unsavoury
gurth
was
a
rogue
so
when
she
hath
saved
my
master
despite
himself
sweet
saint
then
do
thou
join
them
heart
and
body
give
them
joy
abounding
and
happiness
enduring
nor
forget
them
in
the
matter
of
comely
children
so
bring
to
woeful
pentavalon
and
to
us
all
and
every
peace
at
last
and
prosperity
and
to
sorrowful
roger
a
belt
wherein
be
no
accursed
notches
and
a
soul
made
clean
nomen
dominum
amen
master
quoth
he
yet
upon
his
knees
and
viewing
beltane
somewhat
askance
here
is
the
best
i
can
do
for
such
as
yon
gurth
suffice
think
ye
aye
serve
roger
but
for
the
other
matter
why
see
you
master
a
man
may
freely
speak
his
dear
desires
within
his
prayers
more
especially
when
his
prayers
are
potent
as
mine
moreover
i
warned
thee
i
warned
thee
i
would
pray
for
thee
and
pray
for
thee
i
have
now
hereupon
beltane
rose
somewhat
hastily
and
turned
his
back
what
time
roger
sheathed
his
sword
then
spake
beltane
turning
him
to
the
pool
again
we
had
store
of
tools
and
mattocks
i
mind
me
go
and
look
within
the
caves
if
there
be
ever
a
one
left
for
now
must
we
bury
this
poor
clay
ha
must
we
pray
for
him
bury
him
master
and
bury
him
roger
then
roger
sighed
and
shook
his
head
and
so
left
beltane
who
fell
again
to
profound
meditation
but
of
a
sudden
hearing
a
cry
he
turned
to
behold
roger
running
very
fleetly
who
coming
near
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
sought
to
drag
him
away
run
he
panted
run
master
i
ha
just
seen
a
goblin
run
master
now
beholding
the
terror
in
roger
eyes
beltane
unsheathed
his
sword
show
me
roger
said
he
nay
lord
of
what
avail
let
away
this
place
is
rank
o
deviltries
and
witchcraft
show
me
roger
come
perforce
roger
led
the
way
very
heedful
to
avoid
each
patch
of
shadow
until
they
were
come
opposite
that
cave
where
aforetime
beltane
had
been
customed
to
sleep
here
roger
paused
master
he
whispered
there
is
a
thing
within
that
groaneth
master
a
thing
very
like
unto
a
goblin
for
i
ha
seen
it
a
pale
thing
that
creepeth
holy
saints
is
here
again
hark
to
it
and
in
very
truth
beltane
heard
a
sound
the
which
soft
though
it
was
checked
his
breath
and
chilled
his
flesh
and
as
he
peered
into
the
gloomy
recesses
of
the
cavern
there
moved
something
vague
amid
the
shadows
something
that
rose
up
slow
and
painfully
roger
was
down
gasping
on
his
knees
beltane
hand
was
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
as
out
into
the
moonlight
crept
one
very
bent
and
feeble
shrouded
in
a
long
grey
cloak
a
pitiful
figure
that
leaning
a
hand
upon
the
rock
slowly
raised
a
drooping
head
then
beltane
saw
that
this
was
the
witch
jolette
a
while
she
stood
thus
one
hand
supporting
her
against
the
rocky
bank
the
other
hid
within
the
folds
of
her
long
mantle
o
my
lord
said
she
all
day
long
my
heart
hath
been
calling
calling
to
thee
so
art
come
at
last
thanks
be
to
god
o
my
lord
beltane
now
as
she
spake
she
reached
out
a
hand
to
him
so
that
the
shrouding
mantle
fell
away
then
beholding
what
it
had
hid
beltane
let
fall
his
sword
and
leaping
forward
caught
her
within
his
arm
ah
hurt
he
cried
my
lord
i
strove
to
bind
it
up
i
am
cunning
in
herbs
and
simples
but
my
hurt
is
too
deep
for
any
leechcraft
soon
i
must
die
lay
me
down
i
pray
thee
thine
arms
are
strong
lord
beltane
and
very
gentle
how
dost
grieve
for
a
witch
lord
for
poor
jolette
nay
comfort
ye
my
life
has
been
none
so
sweet
i
should
dread
to
lose
it
how
cometh
this
he
questioned
gently
on
his
knees
beside
her
was
the
red
pertolepe
men
nay
messire
they
have
but
killed
me
but
o
my
dear
lord
heed
me
well
a
week
agone
lord
pertolepe
marched
hither
seeking
thee
with
a
great
company
led
by
yon
gurth
and
when
he
found
thee
not
he
hanged
gurth
yet
tarried
here
awhile
then
i
knowing
a
secret
path
hither
that
none
else
do
know
came
and
hearkened
to
their
councils
so
do
i
know
that
he
is
marched
for
winisfarne
ha
is
this
so
cried
beltane
clenching
his
fist
then
will
he
hang
and
burn
aye
is
like
enough
messire
but
o
heed
me
he
goeth
for
a
deeper
purpose
list
beltane
o
list
he
goeth
to
seize
upon
the
noble
and
saintly
abbess
veronica
to
bear
her
captive
unto
pentavalon
city
there
to
hold
her
hostage
for
for
thee
beltane
for
thee
how
mean
you
when
he
hath
her
safe
duke
ivo
because
he
hath
learned
to
fear
thee
at
last
will
send
envoys
to
thee
demanding
thou
shalt
yield
up
to
him
the
town
of
belsaye
and
thy
body
to
his
mercy
or
this
fair
and
noble
lady
abbess
shall
be
shamed
and
dishonoured
and
know
a
death
most
dire
and
ah
because
thou
art
the
man
thou
art
thou
must
needs
yield
thyself
to
ivo
cruel
hands
and
belsaye
to
flame
and
ravishment
not
so
answered
beltane
frowning
within
belsaye
are
many
women
and
children
also
nor
should
these
die
that
one
might
live
saintly
abbess
though
she
be
now
hereupon
the
witch
jolette
raised
herself
and
set
her
two
hands
passionately
on
beltane
shoulders
and
looked
upon
him
and
fearful
ah
beltane
beltane
my
lord
she
panted
but
that
i
am
under
a
vow
now
could
i
tell
thee
a
thing
would
fire
thy
soul
to
madness
but
o
believe
believe
and
know
ye
this
when
duke
ivo
embassy
shall
tell
thee
all
thou
shalt
suffer
them
to
take
thee
thou
shalt
endure
bonds
and
shame
and
death
itself
so
now
thou
shalt
swear
to
a
dying
woman
that
thou
wilt
not
rest
nor
stay
until
thou
shalt
free
this
lady
abbess
for
on
her
safety
doth
hang
thy
life
and
the
freedom
of
pentavalon
swear
o
swear
me
this
my
lord
beltane
so
shall
i
die
in
peace
swear
o
swear
now
looking
within
her
glowing
eyes
feeling
the
tremble
of
her
hands
beltane
bowed
his
head
i
swear
said
he
so
now
may
god
hear
this
thy
oath
and
i
die
in
peace
and
saying
this
jolette
sank
in
his
arms
and
lay
a
while
as
one
that
swoons
but
presently
her
heavy
eyes
unclosed
and
on
her
lips
there
dawned
a
smile
right
wondrous
to
behold
so
marvellous
tender
was
it
i
pray
thee
lord
unhelm
that
i
may
see
thee
once
again
thy
golden
hair
wondering
but
nothing
speaking
beltane
laid
by
his
bascinet
threw
back
his
and
bent
above
her
low
and
lower
until
she
might
reach
up
and
touch
those
golden
curls
with
failing
hand
lord
beltane
boy
she
whispered
stoop
lower
mine
eyes
fail
hearken
o
my
heart
even
as
thy
strong
arms
do
cradle
me
so
have
these
arms
held
thee
o
little
beltane
i
have
borne
thee
oft
upon
my
heart
ere
now
oft
have
hushed
thee
to
rosy
sleep
upon
this
bosom
was
from
these
arms
sir
benedict
caught
thee
on
that
woeful
day
for
i
that
die
here
against
thy
heart
beltane
am
jolette
thy
wilt
thou
kiss
me
once
so
beltane
stooped
and
kissed
her
and
when
he
laid
her
down
jolette
the
witch
was
dead
full
long
beltane
knelt
absorbed
in
prayer
and
as
he
prayed
he
wept
so
long
knelt
he
thus
that
at
last
cometh
roger
treading
soft
and
reverently
and
touched
him
master
he
whispered
then
beltane
arose
as
one
that
dreams
and
stood
a
while
looking
down
upon
that
pale
and
placid
face
on
whose
silent
lips
the
wondrous
smile
still
lingered
but
of
a
sudden
roger
fingers
grasped
his
arm
master
he
whispered
again
thereon
beltane
turned
and
thus
he
saw
that
roger
looked
neither
on
him
nor
on
the
dead
and
that
he
pointed
with
shaking
finger
now
glancing
whither
he
pointed
beltane
beheld
high
on
the
bank
above
them
a
mounted
knight
armed
who
stared
down
at
them
through
closed
visor
a
fierce
and
figure
looming
gigantic
athwart
the
splendour
of
the
sinking
moon
and
even
as
they
stared
in
wonder
a
broad
shield
flashed
and
knight
and
horse
were
gone
chapter
liv
how
beltane
fought
with
a
doughty
stranger
lord
quoth
roger
wiping
sweat
from
him
yonder
certes
was
forsooth

i

the
like
o

how
think

of
yon
devilish

it
one
moment
and
lo
in
the
twinkle
of
an
eye

ye
master
i
do
think
was
some
roving
knight
nay
but
lord
how
shall
honest
flesh
and
blood
go
away
into
thin
air
whiles
a
man
but
blinketh
an
eye

ground

slope
thereabouts

yonder

saint
cuthbert
shield
us
say
i
yon
was
for
sure
a
spirit
damned
hark
do
spirits
go
in
steel
roger
said
beltane
stooping
for
his
sword
for
indeed
plain
and
loud
upon
the
prevailing
quiet
was
the
ring
and
clash
of
heavy
armour
what
time
from
the
bushes
that
clothed
the
steep
a
tall
figure
strode
and
the
moon
made
a
glory
in
polished
shield
it
gleamed
upon
helm
it
flashed
upon
brassart
vanbrace
and
plastron
being
come
near
the
grim
and
warlike
figure
halted
and
leaning
gauntleted
hand
upon
long
shield
stood
silent
a
while
seeming
to
stare
on
beltane
through
the
narrow
slit
of
his
great
casque
but
even
as
he
viewed
beltane
so
stared
beltane
on
him
on
the
fineness
of
his
armour
chain
and
plate
of
the
new
fashion
on
his
breadth
of
shoulder
and
length
of
limb
from
shining
casque
to
gleaming
shield
whereon
was
neither
charge
nor
blazon
and
so
at
last
spake
my
beltane
very
gentle
and
courteous
messire
an
thou
be
come
in
peace
now
shalt
thou
be
right
welcome
peace
quoth
the
knight
loud
and
fierce
and
his
laughter
rang
hoarse
within
his
helm
peace
forsooth
thou
art
a
tall
and
seemly
youth
a
youth
fair
spoken
and
yet
ha
a
belt
of
silver
and
golden
hair
and
yet
so
very
youthful
art
thou
in
very
truth
this
famous
rogue
whose
desperate
deeds
do
live
on
every
tongue
who
hath
waked
duke
ivo
from
his
security
insomuch
that
he
doth
yearn
him
for
that
yellow
head
o
thine
art
thou
beltane
the
outlaw
and
rebel
is
so
men
do
call
me
messire
verily
youth
methinks
dost
lie
for
i
have
heard
this
outlaw
is
beyond
all
men
wild
and
fierce
and
weaveth
him
demoniac
spells
and
enchantments
most
accurst
whereby
he
maketh
gate
and
door
and
mighty
portcullis
to
ope
and
yield
before
his
pointed
finger
and
bolt
and
bar
and
massy
wall
to
give
him
passage
when
he
will
as
witness
the
great
keep
of
garthlaxton
that
he
did
burn
with
hellish
fire
i
have
heard
he
doth
commonly
burn
gibbets
to
warm
him
and
beareth
off
great
lords
beneath
his
arm
as
i
might
a
small
coney
and
slayeth
him
three
or
four
with
his
every
stroke
is
said
that
he
doth
wax
daily
mightier
and
more
fierce
since
he
doth
drink
hot
blood
and
batteneth
on
flesh
tender
babes
beneath
the
orbèd
moon
messire
said
beltane
beginning
to
frown
within
thy
wild
and
foolish
talk
is
this
much
truth
that
i
with
divers
trusty
comrades
did
indeed
burn
down
the
shameful
gallows
of
belsaye
and
bore
captive
a
certain
lordly
knave
as
for
garthlaxton
the
thing
was
simple
o
boastful
boy
quoth
the
knight
tossing
aside
his
shield
o
beardless
one
since
thou
dost
proclaim
thyself
this
desperate
rogue
here
is
reason
just
for
some
small
debate
betwixt
us
do
on
thy
coif
forthwith
for
now
will
i
strive
to
make
an
end
of
thee
and
speaking
the
knight
unsheathed
a
long
and
ponderous
sword
how
an
i
fight
thee
not
sir
knight
then
must
i
needs
belabour
thee
to
the
good
of
thy
soul
sir
outlaw
so
on
with
thy
coif
i
say
incontinent
ran
roger
to
fetch
his
bascinet
the
which
beltane
slowly
fitted
on
above
his
hood
of
mail
and
thereafter
albeit
unwillingly
fronted
this
doughty
knight
foot
to
foot
and
point
to
point
now
stepped
they
a
moment
about
each
other
for
all
their
weighty
armour
and
with
long
blades
advanced
then
of
a
sudden
they
closed
and
immediately
the
air
shivered
to
the
ring
and
grind
of
flashing
whirling
steel
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
they
fought
upon
the
level
sward
what
time
black
roger
rubbed
complacent
hands
and
confident
and
ever
as
they
fought
the
stranger
knight
laughed
and
gibed
harsh
and
loud
from
behind
his
grimly
casque
ho
fight
youth
fight
cried
he
have
done
with
have
at
thee
fight
i
say
a
a
whirl
of
glimmering
steel
and
his
long
blade
smote
sparks
from
bascinet
whereat
roger
smile
incontinent
vanished
and
his
face
waxed
suddenly
anxious
and
long
but
fierce
and
fiercer
the
stranger
knight
beset
my
beltane
the
while
he
lashed
him
with
mocking
tongue
call
ye
this
fighting
sir
youthful
outlaw
doth
thine
arm
fail
thee
so
soon
tap
not
i
say
lest
i
grow
angered
and
slay
thee
forthright
then
blow
for
blow
did
beltane
the
mighty
fall
on
right
furiously
but
ever
blade
met
blade
whiles
roger
danced
on
anxious
feet
praying
for
the
end
of
a
sudden
shouted
he
joyously
for
flashing
high
in
air
down
came
beltane
long
blade
strong
and
true
upon
the
helm
a
fell
stroke
that
drave
the
stranger
reeling
back
fierce
and
swift
leapt
beltane
to
smite
again
came
a
shock
of
clashing
steel
a
flurry
of
stroke
and
and
thereafter
a
hoarse
shout
of
dismay
from
roger
for
beltane
stood
as
one
dazed
staring
upon
his
empty
right
hand
what
time
the
knight
boomed
derisive
laughter
through
his
vizor
then
sprang
grim
roger
dagger
aloft
but
swifter
than
he
the
knight
sword
swung
flat
fell
that
long
blade
on
bascinet
wielded
by
an
arm
so
strong
that
roger
staggering
aside
rolled
upon
the
ling
and
thereafter
sat
up
and
fearful
o
master
he
panted
here
is
none
of
honest
flesh
and
blood
is
himself
as
i
did
warn
thee
may
saint
cuthbert
saint
bede
saint
edmund
go
to
cease
thy
windy
prattling
roger
spake
the
knight
and
letting
fall
his
sword
he
lifted
his
visor
and
behold
a
face
lean
and
with
eyes
quick
and
bright
and
a
smiling
mouth
by
reason
of
an
ancient
wound
know
ye
me
not
lord
beltane
quoth
he
with
look
right
loving
hast
forgot
me
indeed
most
loved
lad
but
swift
came
my
beltane
and
with
arms
in
eager
welcome
sir
benedict
he
cried
hast
come
at
last
now
do
i
joy
to
see
thee
my
lord
says
benedict
wagging
mailed
finger
ha
beltane
canst
burn
gibbets
storm
mighty
castles
and
desperate
odds
yet
is
old
benedict
thy
master
at
stroke
of
sword
still
though
forsooth
hast
dinted
me
my
helm
methinks
o
sweet
lad
come
to
my
arms
yearned
for
thee
these
many
days
herewith
sir
benedict
caught
beltane
within
his
close
embrace
and
patted
him
with
gauntleted
hands
and
laughed
for
very
gladness
o
foolish
youth
o
youthful
fool
quoth
he
surely
thou
of
all
fools
art
greatest
a
youthful
fool
o
mighty
son
of
mighty
father
how
mighty
hath
thy
folly
been
o
lovely
lad
that
hath
attempted
deeds
impossible
pitting
thyself
ivo
and
all
his
might
verily
beltane
the
loveliest
fool
that
ever
man
did
love
nay
but
dear
messire
says
beltane
as
sir
benedict
stayed
for
breath
pray
thee
where
is
thy
meaning
sweet
lad
i
do
but
strive
to
tell
thee
a
fool
yet
so
glad
am
i
of
thy
foolish
company
the
words
do
stick
somewhat
but
my
meaning
shall
be
manifest
now
mark
me
didst
not
carry
off
the
red
pertolepe
the
lances
of
his
aye
my
lord
didst
not
have
thy
hand
on
the
throat
of
that
cold
smiling
rogue
sir
gui
of
allerdale
verily
messire
and
hold
within
thy
grasp
the
life
of
that
gilles
of
brandonmere
whose
father
i
slew
twelve
years
agone
i
thank
god
is
true
good
benedict
and
didst
not
suffer
these
to
live
on
and
work
their
pestilent
wills
beltane
sir
i
did
but
so
art
thrice
a
fool
when
we
see
a
foul
and
noxious
worm
to
tread
it
under
foot
is
a
virtuous
act
so
when
a
man
doth
constant
sin
man
and
maid
to
kill
him
quoth
beltane
sir
gui
and
gilles
of
brandonmere
have
made
an
end
of
sinning
methinks
why
is
so
i
heard
of
late
beltane
and
herein
is
some
small
comfort
but
red
pertolepe
is
yet
to
slay
truly
cried
beltane
clenching
his
fists
and
he
marcheth
on
winisfarne
to
burn
and
hang
content
you
my
lord
beltane
waldron
of
brand
lieth
in
winisfarne
and
i
am
here
so
doth
my
heart
rejoice
for
thee
benedict
thou
right
trusty
and
doughty
friend
but
how
came
ye
hither
and
wherefore
methought
thee
yet
in
thrasfordham
aha
dear
lad
so
doth
ivo
at
this
moment
i
pray
god
a
week
agone
and
ere
the
investment
was
complete
wondrous
news
reached
me
from
waldron
of
brand
whose
sire
bore
my
pennon
in
thy
noble
father
wars
and
because
i
knew
waldron
word
is
ever
less
than
his
deed
and
belike
that
i
grow
weary
of
sieges
seven
have
i
withstood
within
these
latter
years
i
at
dead
of
night
by
devious
and
secret
ways
stole
forth
of
thrasfordham
dight
in
this
armour
the
which
mark
me
is
more
cumbrous
than
fair
howbeit
i
got
me
clear
and
my
lord
beltane
here
stand
i
to
aid
and
abet
thee
in
all
thy
desperate
affrays
henceforth
aha
methinks
shall
be
great
doings
within
the
greenwood
anon
aye
but
what
of
thrasfordham
an
duke
ivo
besiege
it
he
shall
find
five
hundred
and
more
right
doughty
fellows
with
sir
richard
of
wark
and
sir
brian
of
shand
that
were
to
thy
knightly
sire
to
keep
him
in
play
and
what
would
ye
here
sir
benedict
fight
beltane
fight
methinks
he
shall
lack
nothing
for
hard
smiting
that
rideth
with
thee
hey
boy
i
do
yearn
amain
for
the
shock
of
a
charge
my
company
is
but
small
alas
sighed
beltane
is
so
i
heard
my
beltane
quoth
sir
benedict
and
smiling
his
wry
smile
he
took
a
small
that
hung
about
his
neck
let
us
therefore
make
it
larger
how
so
how
so
good
benedict
ha
mean
you
watch
now
so
saying
sir
benedict
set
the
horn
to
his
lip
and
winded
it
three
times
loud
and
shrill
and
thereafter
stood
with
hand
upraised
and
lo
upon
the
stillness
a
sound
that
grew
and
grew
a
whisper
a
rustling
as
of
strong
wind
in
trees
and
presently
upon
the
high
banks
to
north
and
east
and
west
a
great
company
appeared
and
footmen
whose
armour
flashed
the
moon
while
high
bascinet
and
helm
rose
deadly
pike
and
ponderous
lance
rank
upon
rank
a
very
forest
quoth
sir
benedict
and
pointing
to
the
grim
array
behold
lord
duke
hither
have
i
brought
thee
five
hundred
archers
and
with
three
hundred
knights
and
and
each
and
every
a
man
well
tried
and
chosen
all
vowed
to
follow
thee
and
smite
in
pentavalon
cause
even
as
i
their
lord
that
do
love
thee
for
thy
noble
father
sake
and
for
thine
own
sweet
and
knightly
worth
so
saying
sir
benedict
fell
upon
his
knee
before
that
great
assemblage
and
caught
beltane
hand
and
kissed
it
whereon
from
those
gleaming
ranks
rose
a
deep
and
thunderous
shout
while
lance
and
flashed
again
now
looking
from
this
right
goodly
array
to
the
proud
and
figure
that
bent
so
humbly
at
his
feet
beltane
heart
swelled
amain
and
all
things
grew
blurred
and
misty
in
his
sight
sir
benedict
said
he
thou
good
and
noble
knight
o
benedict
dear
my
friend
kneel
not
to
me
for
thy
so
great
love
thy
faith
and
loyalty
fain
would
i
thank
thee
yet
words
be
so
poor
and
i
o
benedict
lord
said
benedict
our
camp
lieth
scarce
three
miles
westward
come
i
pray
thee
nay
first
come
ye
friend
and
look
upon
a
dead
witch
that
was
indeed
a
noble
woman
so
beltane
brought
sir
benedict
where
lay
the
dead
jolette
smiling
yet
as
though
into
the
eyes
of
god
now
beholding
her
sir
benedict
beckoned
roger
and
bid
him
stimmon
certain
of
his
company
forthwith
and
when
roger
hasted
back
with
divers
awestruck
fellows
at
his
heels
they
stood
staring
amazed
to
behold
these
two
great
knights
humbly
kneeling
side
by
side
to
pray
for
the
soul
of
her
who
all
her
days
had
been
scorned
of
men
as
the
witch
jolette
chapter
lv
how
they
marched
for
winisfarne
at
peep
of
day
the
trumpets
blew
and
beltane
starting
up
from
slumber
found
the
great
camp
all
astir
about
him
the
smoke
of
a
hundred
rose
up
into
the
stilly
air
of
morning
and
made
a
fragrant
mist
amid
the
trees
beneath
which
armour
glinted
as
guard
relieved
guard
and
the
companies
mustered
under
arms
and
ever
as
the
sun
rose
the
bustle
waxed
and
grew
with
a
coming
and
going
about
the
fires
where
the
morning
meal
was
preparing
here
a
mighty
furbishing
of
arms
and
armour
yonder
a
prodigious
hissing
and
where
chargers
and
were
picketed
line
upon
line
goodly
beasts
that
stamped
and
snorted
and
whinnied
joyously
and
everywhere
was
noise
and
cheer
of
talk
and
laughter
yet
everywhere
was
method
and
a
strict
orderliness
in
all
things
wherefore
beltane
very
heart
sang
within
him
now
as
he
stood
thus
viewing
all
things
and
watchful
he
was
presently
aware
of
sir
benedict
and
black
roger
who
walked
together
within
a
distant
alley
and
as
they
passed
them
to
and
fro
black
roger
talked
amain
what
time
sir
benedict
seemed
to
hearken
right
solemn
and
attentive
oft
pausing
to
question
him
quick
and
eager
and
oft
to
clap
hand
to
roger
brawny
back
and
sometimes
laughed
he
blithe
and
joyous
and
sometimes
hearkened
with
grizzled
head
until
a
turn
in
the
glade
hid
them
from
sight
little
by
little
above
the
resinous
fragrance
of
the
fires
rose
other
scents
more
delectable
to
the
nostrils
of
a
hungry
man
thus
waking
from
his
meditations
beltane
turned
him
wistfully
towards
where
above
the
nearest
fire
a
goodly
cooking
pot
seethed
and
bubbled
invitingly
but
even
now
a
hand
slipped
within
his
arm
and
holding
him
thus
sir
benedict
viewed
him
and
smiled
on
him
his
wry
and
twisted
smile
beltane
said
he
wagging
his
head
o
beltane
thou
wilt
mind
how
upon
a
time
as
i
drank
a
bowl
of
milk
with
thee
amid
the
green
in
mortain
i
did
warn
thee
that
she
had
red
hair
and
was
like
to
prove
a
therefore
now
hereupon
my
beltane
must
needs
catch
his
breath
and
flush
to
the
ears
of
him
and
therewith
strive
to
look
at
his
ease
like
the
very
youth
he
was
how
messire
hath
roger
babbled
to
thee
babbled
quoth
sir
benedict
shaking
his
head
nay
roger
is
no
babbler
of
secret
matters
for
many
do
ken
of
thy
love
beltane
and
i
am
thy
friend
so
is
thy
happiness
my
happiness
thus
do
i
say
god
and
the
sweet
saints
bless
thee
in
thy
love
dear
lad
for
a
right
noble
lady
is
helen
the
beautiful
and
meet
to
thine
embracements
by
her
so
great
love
by
her
proved
faithfulness
shalt
thou
yet
win
to
happiness
nay
dear
my
benedict
first
must
pentavalon
win
to
peace
aye
by
helen
noble
love
for
o
sir
benedict
i
have
sworn
an
oath
aye
sweet
lad
but
roger
hath
prayed
a
prayer
hath
he
told
thee
so
much
benedict
so
much
quoth
sir
benedict
pressing
his
arm
so
much
o
man
that
hereafter
needs
must
i
love
thee
and
honour
thee
the
more
since
man
art
thou
my
beltane
for
all
thy
so
great
youthfulness
nay
benedict
am
none
so
youthful
thy
very
speech
doth
prove
thee
so
yet
being
boy
thou
art
forsooth
a
man
and
wherefore
for
that
i
do
know
more
of
thee
is
suffering
is
sorrow
nobly
borne
doth
make
the
man
beltane
suffering
messire
yon
lock
of
hair
showeth
very
white
amid
the
gold
beltane
but
thou
art
better
man
therefore
methinks
the
fetters
of
thy
dungeon
yet
gleam
upon
thy
wrists
beltane
but
truly
i
do
think
within
thy
prison
was
forged
the
sword
shall
avenge
our
woes
and
free
pentavalon
at
last
think
you
indeed
thou
wise
benedict
that
we
by
grief
and
sorrow
do
rise
to
find
our
nobler
selves
aye
verily
is
but
by
sorrow
and
suffering
our
strength
or
weakness
groweth
manifest
beltane
yet
o
benedict
i
did
doubt
her
plied
her
with
scornful
tongue
and
drave
her
lonely
from
me
and
dost
grieve
amain
and
sorrow
therefore
o
youth
yea
indeed
indeed
sleeping
and
waking
and
do
yearn
to
woo
her
to
forgiveness
on
thy
knees
to
crush
her
in
thine
arms
and
kiss
her
breath
away
o
lover
aye
dear
sir
benedict
in
such
sort
and
so
greatly
that
my
passion
oft
doth
fright
me
so
fiercely
do
i
yearn
and
long
yet
tremble
and
grow
faint
at
thought
of
it
yet
art
thou
here
bedight
in
arms
o
man
thy
yearning
body
far
removed
from
all
temptation
till
thou
hast
proved
thee
worthy
her
embrace
and
thus
it
is
i
know
thee
for
a
man
my
beltane
and
thou
benedict
thou
hast
yearned
and
trembled
with
love
ere
now
thou
hast
been
a
lover
once
methinks
but
here
sir
benedict
fell
to
silence
walking
with
face
averted
and
gaze
bent
towards
the
dewy
grass
and
quickened
his
steps
until
they
were
come
nigh
unto
the
camp
then
lifted
he
his
head
quoth
he
my
lord

and
there

many
knights

esquires
and
gentles
of
degree

wait
to
pay

homage
so
presently
came
they
into
the
midst
of
the
camp
where
seated
on
the
mossy
ling
hungry
and
expectant
were
many
noble
lords
and
gentle
knights
and
esquires
of
degree
who
beholding
sir
benedict
with
beltane
rose
up
with
one
accord
young
men
were
these
for
the
most
part
yet
were
there
many
grizzled
heads
and
wrinkled
brows
among
them
grim
lords
of
the
old
duke
following
much
versed
in
war
calm
of
judgment
and
wise
in
council
but
one
and
all
did
they
stare
upon
my
beltane
in
wonder
at
his
youth
because
of
his
so
famous
deeds
now
spake
to
them
sir
benedict
short
and
my
lords
this
is
he
of
whom
ye
all
have
heard
beltane
hight
son
of
beltane
our
duke
for
whom
we
together
have
held

long
and
painfully
my
lord

of
all
the
knights
and
nobles
of

here
sir
brian
of

brother
to
eric
called
the
so
now
all
said
my
lord
wherefore
i
pray
let
us
eat
forthwith
down
they
sat
together
on
the
grass
all
and
sundry
and
ate
and
drank
and
laughed
and
talked
insomuch
that
in
brake
and
thicket
near
and
far
the
birds
carolled
and
chattered
in
pretty
mockery
lord
beltane
quoth
sir
benedict
when
the
meal
was
ended
ere
i
met
thee
was
my
intent
this
hour
to
march
on
winisfarne
according
to
my
promise
to
waldron
of
brand
how
say
you
forsooth
nodded
beltane
as
soon
as
ye
will
thus
within
the
hour
the
trumpets
brayed
horse
and
all
was
seeming
hurry
and
confusion
yet
a
confusion
this
governed
by
soldierly
method
so
that
ere
long
horsemen
were
mounted
and
footmen
in
array
what
time
beltane
bedight
in
goodly
vizored
casque
with
lance
and
shield
borne
behind
him
came
where
stood
sir
benedict
beside
a
great
and
noble
forthwith
beltane
mounted
and
forthwith
from
these
ranks
a
great
shout
arose
beltane
the
duke
the
duke
now
reining
in
his
eager
beast
beltane
looked
upon
that
stern
array
and
as
he
looked
his
eye
kindled
and
his
heart
swelled
within
him
o
men
said
he
i
that
ye
do
acclaim
am
but
a
man
even
as
ye
are
men
to
bear
with
ye
the
heat
and
labour
of
the
day
what
ye
must
endure
that
will
i
endure
with
you
here
stand
i
ready
to
spill
my
blood
that
wrong
may
cease
even
as
ye
i
am
prepared
to
adventure
me
life
and
limb
that
lust
and
murder
may
cease
to
be
and
innocence
and
truth
may
walk
again
all
unashamed
so
shall
i
lead
ye
into
battles
and
affrays
desperate
and
bloody
where
foes
shall
be
and
we
few
but
we
do
fight
for
hearth
and
home
and
the
thought
of
this
methinks
shall
nerve
us
strong
as
giants
yet
is
our
way
a
perilous
way
and
some
of
us
belike
must
die
but
by
the
blood
of
such
this
our
country
is
hallowed
unto
those
that
shall
come
after
us
so
shall
our
memories
teach
others
how
to
die
and
better
how
to
live
that
this
our
country
may
stand
hereafter
for
all
things
great
and
noble
he
that
dieth
for
home
and
children
shall
mayhap
from
the
floor
of
heaven
look
down
upon
a
great
and
happy
people
whose
freedom
he
by
weary
marches
by
pain
of
wounds
by
sharp
and
sudden
death
he
himself
hath
helped
to
purchase
and
in
their
peace
and
happiness
find
an
added
joy
o
men
who
would
not
be
a
man
to
fight
in
such
just
cause
who
would
not
cherish
life
that
he
might
lose
it
to
such
noble
purpose
now
therefore
all
ye
that
do
love
pentavalon
follow
thus
saying
my
beltane
wheeled
his
horse
and
with
rhythmic
ring
and
clash
together
rank
on
rank
horsemen
and
footmen
they
followed
hard
behind
a
silent
grim
array
with
eyes
that
gleamed
helm
and
bascinet
and
purposeful
hands
that
griped
full
strong
on
lance
and
as
coming
to
the
they
swung
away
northwards
towards
winisfarne
chapter
lvi
what
they
found
at
winisfarne
two
and
two
they
rode
for
the
way
was
narrow
their
flanks
well
covered
by
archers
who
marched
within
the
green
with
mounted
archers
far
in
their
van
and
others
in
their
rear
a
glory
of
sun
dappled
their
way
with
dancing
shadows
flowers
were
in
bank
and
hedgerow
and
birds
carolled
blithe
in
the
fragrant
air
what
time
sir
benedict
rode
beside
beltane
his
ponderous
casque
at
and
oft
he
turned
his
grizzled
head
to
view
my
thoughtful
beltane
as
one
might
look
upon
a
son
now
in
a
while
beltane
turned
and
meeting
his
look
reached
out
to
him
his
hand
dear
benedict
said
he
how
much
how
very
much
i
owe
to
thee
thou
art
methinks
the
greatest
knight
that
couched
lance
save
thy
noble
father
quoth
sir
benedict
with
solemn
nod
my
father
you
were
his
esquire
and
comrade
benedict
i
was
beltane
knew
you
my
mother
well
also
thy
mother
why
aye
forsooth
i
knew
thy
mother
very
well
beltane
what
manner
of
woman
was
she
i
pray
the
fairest
and
noblest
these
eyes
have
beheld
the
noblest
and
purest
hark
ye
beltane
and
mark
me
well
there
lived
wife
of
so
stainless
honour
as
the
noble
woman
that
bare
thee
and
yet
sighed
beltane
with
wrinkled
brow
within
the
garden
of
pentavalon
my
father
thy
father
was
a
sick
man
faint
with
wounds
and
spent
with
hardship
all
that
day
as
we
rode
unto
pentavalon
city
he
and
i
his
mind
oft
wandered
and
he
held
wild
talk
in
his
fever
but
hale
was
i
mind
and
body
and
i
do
know
the
duke
thy
father
fell
to
strange
and
sudden
madness
upon
that
dreadful
day
whereby
came
woe
to
pentavalon
and
bitter
remorse
to
him
this
do
i
swear
thy
mother
was
noble
wife
and
saintly
woman
loved
she
my
father
aye
verily
she
was
his
wife
thy
father
was
a
noble
knight
and
peerless
and
oft
warring
on
the
marches
but
methinks
she
was
something
lonely
at
times
beltane
alas
sighed
beltane
and
again
alas
so
fell
they
incontinent
to
deep
thought
and
rode
full
long
in
silence
but
ever
and
anon
as
they
paced
along
together
thus
sir
benedict
must
needs
lift
his
head
to
gaze
upon
my
beltane
and
his
grim
lips
curved
to
smile
infinite
tender
and
in
his
eyes
was
growing
wonder
quoth
he
at
last
beltane
d
mark
this
our
silent
company
not
a
stave
have
they
carolled
since
we
set
forth
but
how
shall
a
man
sing
and
jest
whose
heart
is
set
on
great
emprise
verily
thy
words
have
fired
this
shrivelled
heart
o
mine
till
i
even
as
they
methinks
do
burn
to
fight
pentavalon
cause
to
shield
her
from
woeful
shame
and
ha
such
vile
sights
as
yon
now
looking
where
sir
benedict
pointed
beltane
beheld
a
thing
crookedly
contorted
from
a
knotted
branch
that
jutted
athwart
the
way
insomuch
that
the
must
needs
stoop
cowering
in
his
saddle
lest
he
touch
the
twisted
feet
of
it
dead
three
days
i
judge
mused
sir
benedict
much
is
possible
to
the
red
pertolepe
in
three
days
and
he
hath
a
great
and
powerful
following
is
said
quoth
beltane
and
frowning
a
little
so
would
i
have
it
benedict
they
shall
be
the
more
for
us
to
smite
i
heard
he
musters
full
three
thousand
beltane
what
then
good
benedict
yon
poor
dead
thing
we
passed
but
now
was
worth
a
score
of
men
to
us
and
there
will
be
others
sir
pertolepe
loveth
to
see
men
hang
so
perchance
ere
we
come
to
winisfarne
the
strength
of
thousands
shall
lie
within
these
arms
of
ours
is
a
fair
thought
lad
aye
is
a
right
fair
thought
may
all
the
poor
souls
done
thus
to
sudden
cruel
death
march
within
our
slender
ranks
and
smite
with
us
shoulder
to
shoulder
henceforth
and
now
as
they
went
came
they
on
many
and
divers
signs
of
the
red
pertolepe
passing
here
a
smouldering
heap
of
ruin
whereby
lay
pale
stiff
shapes
half
hidden
in
the
grass
yonder
a
little
child
outstretched
as
though
asleep
save
for
wide
eyes
that
looked
so
blindly
on
the
sun
and
there
beyond
upon
the
white
dust
of
the
road
great
gouts
and
pools
that
had
trickled
from
something
sprawled
among
the
underbrush
and
the
soft
wind
crooned
and
whispered
in
the
leaves
leaves
that
parting
showed
other
shapes
swung
high
in
air
whose
pallid
faces
looked
down
on
them
from
the
tender
green
faces
drawn
and
haggard
with
teeth
agleam
or
open
mouths
whence
screams
had
come
but
very
silent
now
until
the
day
of
judgment
so
rode
they
with
death
above
them
and
around
death
in
many
hateful
shapes
and
oft
sir
benedict
bowed
his
head
as
one
that
prayed
the
while
his
strong
hands
knit
themselves
to
iron
fists
and
oft
from
those
grim
ranks
behind
a
sound
went
up
to
heaven
a
sound
ominous
and
low
that
was
like
unto
a
moan
thus
marched
they
through
heat
and
dust
through
cool
green
shadow
splashing
through
noisy
brook
and
shallow
ford
until
as
the
sun
reached
the
zenith
they
came
to
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
saw
afar
the
walls
and
roofs
of
the
prosperous
town
of
winisfarne
and
ever
as
they
drew
nearer
sir
benedict
stared
on
it
his
black
brows
and
fingered
his
square
chin
as
one
puzzled
beltane
quoth
he
at
last
is
full
ten
years
since
i
saw
winisfarne
and
yet
meseemeth
it
looked
not
so
is
as
though
i
missed
somewhat
and
yet
but
now
came
roger
a
dusty
figure
spurring
from
the
rear
master
he
cried
pointing
with
eager
finger
o
master
the
keep
where
is
the
great
keep
that
stood
yonder
aye
verily
the
keep
nodded
sir
benedict
clapping
mailed
hand
to
thigh
and
was
a
great
and
mighty
hold
as
i
do
mind
me
now
looked
they
gloomily
on
each
other
and
halted
their
array
what
time
sir
benedict
passed
word
for
bows
to
be
strung
and
every
eye
and
every
ear
to
be
strained
right
needfully
then
moved
they
on
again
betimes
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
town
for
defences
it
had
none
but
no
man
moved
therein
and
no
sound
reached
them
but
the
noise
of
their
own
going
thus
in
a
while
with
hands
and
lips
they
rode
into
the
desolation
of
the
befouled
by
signs
of
battle
fierce
and
fell
while
beyond
a
mass
of
charred
ruin
lay
all
that
was
left
of
winisfarne
once
great
and
famous
keep
now
above
this
ruin
divers
gibbets
had
been
set
up
and
behold
these
gibbets
each
bore
a
heavy
burden
then
beltane
lighted
from
his
horse
and
going
apart
laid
by
his
casque
and
sat
him
down
his
head
bowed
betwixt
his
hands
as
one
that
is
direly
sick
in
a
while
as
he
sat
thus
heedless
of
all
things
cometh
roger
master
said
he
saw
ye
the
gibbets
yonder
i
saw
them
roger
upon
those
gibbets
be
divers
of
our
good
fellows
master
there
is
diccon
and
peter
of
my
company
of
pikes
and
gregory
that
was
a
fair
good
bowman
and
there
be
others
also
and
master
these
be
not
hanged
men
not
hanged
no
master
all
these
our
men
died
in
battle
as
their
wounds
do
testify
they
were
dead
men
already
when
pertolepe
hanged
them
on
his
gibbets
and
walkyn
is
not
here
wherefore
methinks
he
liveth
yet
and
pertolepe
is
not
here
yet
where
pertolepe
is
there
shall
we
surely
find
walkyn
for
walkyn
hath
sworn
full
oft
ha
master
master
behold
what
cometh
here
see
yonder
then
beltane
arose
and
looking
where
roger
pointed
beheld
a
strange
misshapen
thing
half
beast
half
man
that
ran
wondrous
fleetly
towards
them
and
as
it
ran
flourished
aloft
a
broken
sword
now
was
he
lost
to
sight
behind
some
bush
or
now
he
bounded
high
over
stream
or
stone
or
fallen
tree
nought
was
there
could
let
or
stay
him
until
he
came
where
stood
sir
benedict
outposts
to
whose
conduct
he
yielded
him
forthwith
and
so
was
presently
brought
into
the
a
wild
figure
this
great
and
hairy
of
head
and
with
the
arms
and
shoulders
of
a
very
giant
bedight
was
he
in
good
yet
foul
with
dirt
and
mire
and
spattered
with
blood
from
heel
to
head
and
in
one
great
hand
he
griped
still
the
fragment
of
a
reddened
sword
all
was
he
and
bleeding
from
the
hair
while
his
mighty
chest
heaved
and
laboured
with
his
running
so
stood
he
betwixt
his
brawny
captors
what
time
he
panted
hoarse
and
loud
and
stared
about
him
beetling
brows
thus
of
a
sudden
he
espied
my
beltane
standing
in
his
youthful
might
whereon
this
monstrous
man
forthwith
dashed
aside
his
stalwart
guards
as
they
had
been
babes
and
ran
towards
beltane
with
hairy
hands
outstretched
whereon
sprang
roger
to
front
him
dagger
but
lo
roger
was
caught
up
in
those
mighty
arms
and
shaken
helplessly
fool
cried
this
grim
fellow
think
ye
i
would
harm
beltane
that
is
my
most
loved
lord
henceforth
i
am
ulf
called
the
strong
and
as
this
my
hateful
body
is
strong
so
is
my
love
lie
there
so
saying
ulf
laid
roger
upon
his
back
and
coming
to
beltane
fell
upon
his
face
before
him
and
caught
his
mailed
feet
and
kissed
them
lord
beltane
he
cried
thou
seest
i
do
love
thee
yet
i
did
bear
thee
captive
to
thy
foe
by
command
of
one
i
love
beyond
all
others
but
thou
lord
beltane
thou
at
peril
of
thy
life
did
save
her
from
shame
and
fiery
death
when
ulf
could
not
so
do
i
love
thee
lord
beltane
and
will
be
thy
slave
henceforth
to
love
and
serve
thee
till
i
die
an
thou
wilt
take
me
misshapen
and
unlovely
ye
behold
me
a
vile
thing
that
men
would
jeer
at
but
that
they
fear
to
die
for
god
who
hath
denied
me
all
else
hath
given
me
strength
beyond
all
men
yet
do
i
hate
myself
and
do
hide
me
from
the
eyes
of
my
fellows
but
an
thou
canst
bear
with
me

wilt
take

and
took

hairy
hand
in
his
ulf

such
noble

and
lovely
so

ulf
the
strong
stood
up
erect
upon
his
feet
and
on
his
swart
cheeks
great
tears
rolled
glistening
lord
said
he
o
beltane
my
lord
and
master
and
bowed
grim
head
with
sudden
sob
whereat
beltane
questioned
him
full
hastily
as
thus
art
wounded
ulf
and
whence
come
ye
in
such
guise
lord
says
ulf
wiping
off
his
tears
and
choking
upon
a
sob
i
came
through
bloody
pertolepe
array
through
nay
how
mean
you
questioned
beltane
the
while
sir
benedict
and
many
wondering
knights
and
esquires
pressed
round
them
in
a
ring
i
mean
through
lord
for
walkyn
need
is
dire
so
burst
i
through
them
i
had
an
axe
but
it
brake
in
my
hold
see
you
even
as
this
my
sword
alack
there
is
no
weapon
that
i
do
not
break
howbeit
here
am
i
lord
hither
come
with
word
for
one
sir
benedict
of
bourne
that
did
covenant
to
meet
with
walkyn
here
at
winisfarne
behold
us
here
speak
on
quoth
sir
benedict
thus
then
saith
walkyn
o
the
dene
that
scarce
had
he
stormed
and
set
fire
to
yonder
than
from
the
south
cometh
a
great
company
the
which
he
at
the
first
did
take
for
ye
but
in
a
while
behold
sir
pertolepe
accursed
raven
banner
the
which
giveth
walkyn
much
to
think
now
cometh
to
him
one
beyond
all
women
noble
and
gracious
and
holy
as
i
do
know
the
fair
and
stately
abbess
veronica
who
years
agone
did
build
and
endow
yon
great
and
goodly
abbey
wherein
all
poor
desolate
souls
should
be
cherished
and
comforted
by
her
and
her
saintly
nuns
and
where
the
stricken
fugitive
might
find
sanctuary
and
peace
and
moreover
be
healed
of
his
hurts
all
this
know
i
since
i
was
fugitive
hurt
and
very
woeful
and
found
me
solace
there
so
cometh
this
noble
lady
to
walkyn
and
with
her
i
and
speaketh
him
calm
and
sweetly
thus
rideth
sir
pertolepe
that
is
knight
of
noble
birth
yet
the
rather
would
i
trust
myself
and
these
my
good
sisters
in
thy
hands
o
man
so
do
i
pray
thee
when
thou
goest
hence
yield
us
the
protection
of
thy
strength
so
shall
heaven
bless
thee
hereon
walkyn
frowned
and
plucked
his
beard
awhile
but
thereafter
came
he
to
kneel
and
kiss
her
hand
and
swear
to
aid
her
the
while
life
him
lasted
then
summoned
he
his
company
lusty
fellows
all
and
called
for
thirty
men
that
would
remain
to
hold
red
pertolepe
in
play
what
time
he
seeketh
place
of
greater
vantage
well
beknown
to
him
forthwith
stood
out
one
tall
orson
hight
a
doughty
fellow
and
with
him
nine
and
twenty
other
lusty
fellows
right
willing
and
with
them
i
and
thereafter
walkyn
formeth
his
company
the
nuns
in
the
midst
and
marched
in
haste
for
brand
that
is
a
lonely
tower
then
did
these
thirty
and
with
them
i
shoot
arrows
amain
on
pertolepe
vanguard
from
every
place
of
vantage
hereabouts
and
met
them
with
right
lusty
and
stayed
thus
their
advance
until
of
the
thirty
there
none
remained
alive
save
seven
and
of
these
i
and
since
we
could
do
no
more
i
that
do
know
this
country
from
my
misshapen
youth
brought
these
men
by
secret
ways
unto
the
tower
of
brand
that
is
desolate
and
a
ruin
yet
strong
withal
and
there
lay
walkyn
that
is
a
notable
fighter
keeping
watch
and
ward
within
the
tower
what
time
he
waited
thy
succour
now
who
so
skilful
and
tender
with
our
wounded
as
this
sweet
and
gracious
lady
abbess
next
day
sure
enough
cometh
pertolepe
with
brave
show
of
horse
and
foot
above
three
thousand
lords
and
straightway
sendeth
he
a
haughty
fellow
to
demand
incontinent
surrender
a
knight
whom
walkyn
forthwith
shot
and
slew
with
his
own
hand
whereat
sir
pertolepe
waxed
exceeding
wroth
and
came
on
amain
and
beset
the
tower
on
all
sides
whereby
they
lost
others
of
their
men
for
walkyn
fellows
shot
exceeding
strong
and
true
and
with
them
i
then
o
my
lords
in
all
that
fierce
debate
who
so
brave
and
calm
heartening
wearied
and
wounded
with
gentle
voice
and
gentler
hand
than
this
same
noble
lady
abbess
for
two
days
lay
we
besieged
whereby
our
food
and
drink
began
to
fail
for
the
well
within
the
tower
is
dried
up
yet
none
did
eat
or
drink
so
sparingly
as
this
same
holy
abbess
now
on
this
the
second
day
lords
cometh
pertolepe
himself
under
flag
of
truce
lords
and
demands
we
yield
to
him
the
body
of
this
same
lady
abbess
to
our
ransom
swearing
on
his
knightly
word
he
then
will
march
away
forthwith
and
seek
our
hurt
no
more
and
to
save
our
lives
fain
would
this
brave
lady
have
yielded
her
to
pertolepe
hands
but
walkyn
mindful
of
his
oath
lords
leaning
him
from
the
battlement
spake
red
pertolepe
defiantly
calling
him
knave
and
liar
and
therewith
spat
upon
him
very
fairly
whereat
pertolepe
sware
to
hang
us
one
and
all
and
the
battle
joined
again
fiercer
than
before
therefore
on
this
the
third
day
seeing
no
hope
of
succour
walkyn
made
him
ready
to
sally
out
a
right
desperate
venture
because
of
the
women
then
spake
i
before
them
all
saying
i
doubted
not
i
might
win
through
and
bring
thee
to
their
aid
an
ye
had
kept
the
tryst
would
they
but
ply
their
shafts
amain
to
cover
me
the
which
was
so
agreed
then
did
this
saintly
lady
abbess
set
her
white
hand
on
this
my
hateful
head
and
prayed
the
sweet
christ
to
shield
this
my
monstrous
body
and
i
thereafter
being
bedight
in
right
good
mail
as
thou
seest
issued
suddenly
out
of
the
tower
whiles
our
foemen
sat
at
meat
and
ran
among
them
roaring
dreadfully
and
smote
amain
full
many
until
my
axe
brake
and
i
betook
me
to
my
sword
and
smote
them
as
i
ran
what
time
walkyn
archers
shot
right
furiously
and
well
thus
came
i
through
bloody
pertolepe
array
and
thus
lords
ye
do
behold
a
something
weary
man
and
a
mighty
hungry
one
withal
now
came
sir
benedict
to
grasp
ulf
great
hand
forsooth
hast
done
a
great
and
noble
thing
quoth
he
thy
twisted
body
doth
hide
a
great
and
manly
soul
meseemeth
so
shalt
lack
for
friend
whiles
benedict
doth
live
and
after
sir
benedict
came
many
other
knights
and
esquires
of
degree
to
bring
him
of
their
own
viands
and
press
upon
him
rich
and
goodly
wine
in
so
much
that
ulf
grew
hot
and
awkward
and
presently
stole
away
to
eat
with
roger
in
a
quiet
corner
but
now
within
the
was
sound
of
song
of
jest
and
laughter
where
were
looked
to
heedfully
buckled
tighter
laced
the
closer
and
carefully
regarded
whiles
ever
and
anon
all
eyes
turned
where
beltane
sat
among
the
older
knights
sir
benedict
beside
him
hearkening
to
their
counsel
and
presently
he
rose
and
lifted
his
hand
whereat
the
trumpets
blared
and
thereafter
with
ring
of
hoof
and
tramp
of
foot
marched
they
forth
of
winisfarne
the
sun
bright
on
helm
and
shield
a
right
gallant
array
and
at
their
head
rode
ulf
the
strong
chapter
lvii
telleth
of
the
onfall
at
brand
by
wild
and
lonely
ways
ulf
led
them
through
mazy
thicket
murmurous
rill
through
fragrant
bracken
that
sweeping
to
their
whispered
as
they
passed
now
rode
they
by
darkling
wood
now
crossed
they
open
heath
all
unerring
rode
ulf
the
strong
now
wheeling
sharp
and
sudden
to
skirt
treacherous
marsh
or
swamp
now
plunging
into
the
gloom
of
desolate
woods
on
and
on
past
lonely
pools
where
doleful
curlews
piped
nor
faltered
he
nor
stayed
until
as
the
sun
grew
low
they
climbed
a
sloping
upland
crowned
by
mighty
trees
and
thick
with
underbrush
here
ulf
checked
his
horse
and
lifted
long
arm
in
warning
whereon
the
company
halted
yet
very
orderly
and
silent
forthwith
down
lighted
beltane
with
sir
benedict
and
ulf
who
pointed
before
them
with
his
finger
lords
said
he
beyond
yon
trees
is
a
valley
and
in
the
valley
the
tower
of
brand
the
which
you
may
see
from
the
brush
yonder
aha
and
hear
also
methinks
and
indeed
the
air
was
full
of
a
strange
droning
sound
that
rose
and
fell
unceasing
a
drowsy
ominous
hum
ah
benedict
said
beltane
frowning
a
little
i
like
not
that
sound
summon
we
our
wisest
heads
for
here
is
matter
for
thought
and
sudden
action
methinks
hereupon
sir
benedict
beckoned
to
his
five
chiefest
knights
and
they
together
followed
ulf
broad
back
up
the
slope
until
they
were
come
within
the
little
wood
and
ever
as
they
advanced
the
strange
hum
grew
louder
hoarser
a
distant
roar
pierced
ever
and
anon
by
sharper
sound
a
confused
din
that
was
the
voice
of
desperate
conflict
presently
ulf
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
little
wood
and
parting
twig
and
leaf
they
looked
forth
and
down
and
what
they
saw
was
this
a
little
valley
wondrous
green
but
very
for
here
and
there
stood
ruined
walls
and
charred
timbers
that
once
had
been
fair
dwellings
and
in
the
midst
of
this
small
and
ruined
hamlet
a
mighty
tower
uprose
hoary
and
yet
stark
and
grim
against
the
sunset
all
about
this
tower
a
great
camp
lay
set
well
out
of
and
camp
and
tower
were
many
men
whose
armour
flashed
rank
on
rank
and
archers
who
kneeling
behind
mantlets
shot
amain
at
battlement
and
loophole
against
the
tower
were
two
great
ladders
roughly
fashioned
and
with
men
but
ever
as
they
strove
to
reach
the
battlement
a
mighty
axe
whirled
and
swung
and
a
long
sword
flashed
and
ever
as
they
fell
so
fell
one
of
the
besiegers
there
stand
walkyn
and
tall
orson
quoth
ulf
biting
his
nails
ha
they
be
dour
fighters
would
i
stood
with
them
we
come
in
due
season
methinks
said
sir
benedict
stroking
his
square
chin
what
is
your
counsel
my
lords
quoth
young
sir
john
of
griswold
let
us
to
horse
and
sally
out
on
them
the
hill
is
with
us
and
we
shall
slay
and
be
slain
quoth
sir
benedict
verily
nodded
grim
sir
bertrand
dost
speak
like
a
very
youth
john
here
methinks
said
sir
benedict
is
work
for
pike
and
first
break
we
their
charge
then
down
on
them
in
flank
with
shock
and
might
of
all
our
lances
ha
is
well
benedict
growled
old
hubert
of
erdington
so
let
me
march
with
the
pikes
art
silent
lord
beltane
quoth
sir
hacon
dost
agree
aye
truly
answered
beltane
rising
but
let
our
pikes
march
in
v
formation
our
mightiest
men
at
the
point
of
the
v
and
with
archers
behind
then
ere
the
foe
do
engage
let
the
v
become
an
l
so
shall
we
oppose
them
two
faces
now
when
sir
pertolepe
chivalry
charge
let
sir
benedict
with
two
hundred
knights
and
spur
in
upon
their
flank
driving
them
confused
upon
their
main
battle
what
time
i
yet
hid
within
the
green
will
sound
my
rallying
note
that
walkyn
knoweth
of
old
whereat
he
shall
sally
out
upon
their
further
flank
then
will
i
with
my
hundred
horse
charge
down
upon
their
rear
so
should
we
have
them
methinks
how
say
you
my
lords
truly
quoth
sir
bertrand
closing
his
vizor
thy
father
liveth
again
in
thee
methinks
forthwith
pikemen
and
archers
fell
into
array
with
cnut
at
their
head
while
behind
the
spreading
ranks
of
pikes
prat
and
his
archers
were
ranged
bows
strung
and
quivers
slung
before
and
presently
at
beltane
word
they
swung
forth
of
the
sheltering
green
bascinet
and
away
they
swung
down
the
slope
a
stalwart
company
and
light
and
in
their
midst
old
hubert
of
erdington
in
his
heavy
armour
whose
long
sword
flashed
as
he
flourished
his
farewell
with
rhythmic
step
and
swing
of
broad
mailed
shoulders
they
marched
until
they
were
come
down
into
the
valley
and
now
as
they
advanced
swift
and
steady
rose
shouts
from
besieged
and
besiegers
sir
pertolepe
trumpets
brayed
defiance
and
alarm
and
of
a
sudden
forth
of
his
camp
mailed
horsemen
rode
rank
upon
rank
pennons
and
armour
flashing
in
the
sunset
glare
but
as
they
mustered
to
the
charge
as
shields
flashed
and
lances
sank
sir
benedict
pikemen
wheeled
their
ranks
swung
wide
and
lo
the
v
was
become
an
now
from
this
l
bows
twanged
and
arrows
flew
amain
above
the
kneeling
pikemen
what
time
sir
pertolepe
trumpets
blared
the
charge
and
down
upon
those
slender
ranks
his
chivalry
thundered
horses
reared
and
fell
screaming
beneath
the
whistling
but
on
swept
the
charge
those
thin
ranks
bent
and
swayed
the
shock
as
lance
crossed
pike
but
these
rested
on
firm
ground
and
upon
their
deadly
points
horses
smitten
low
reared
transfixed
and
above
these
rocking
pikes
steel
flashed
and
flickered
where
the
stout
archers
plied
their
heavy
broadswords
while
loud
above
the
din
sir
voice
boomed
hoarse
encouragement
what
time
he
thrust
and
smote
above
the
kneeling
pikemen
now
out
from
the
green
sir
benedict
paced
astride
his
great
black
charger
and
behind
him
his
two
hundred
knights
and
their
vizors
closed
their
shields
slung
before
the
points
of
their
long
and
ponderous
lances
agleam
high
in
air
then
turned
sir
benedict
and
looked
on
their
grimly
ranks
o
sirs
quoth
he
who
would
not
be
a
man
to
fight
in
such
just
cause
so
saying
he
smiled
his
wry
and
twisted
smile
and
closed
his
vizor
then
with
shield
addressed
and
feet
thrust
far
within
the
stirrups
he
lightly
feutred
his
deadly
lance
and
behold
down
swept
every
lance
behind
him
as
leaning
low
behind
his
shield
he
shouted
right
joyously
come
ye
messires
lay
on
this
day
for
pentavalon
forward
bounded
the
great
horses
the
slope
away
away
gathering
speed
with
every
stride
away
away
across
the
level
with
flying
rein
and
busy
spur
and
now
a
loud
shouting
and
dire
amaze
among
sir
pertolepe
battle
with
desperate
wheeling
of
ranks
and
spurring
of
rearing
horses
while
sir
benedict
riders
swept
down
on
them
grim
and
voiceless
fast
and
faster
came
a
roaring
crash
beneath
whose
dire
shock
sir
pertolepe
ranks
were
riven
and
rent
asunder
and
over
and
through
their
red
confusion
sir
benedict
rode
in
thunderous
resistless
might
straight
for
where
above
their
ranks
fluttered
and
flew
sir
pertolepe
raven
banner
now
in
hot
haste
sir
pertolepe
launched
another
charge
to
check
that
furious
onset
what
time
he
reformed
and
strengthened
his
main
battle
but
with
speed
unchecked
sir
benedict
mighty
ranks
met
them
in
full
career
broke
them
flung
them
reeling
back
on
sir
pertolepe
staggering
van
and
all
was
wild
disorder
above
which
roaring
tumult
the
raven
banner
reeled
and
swayed
and
the
fray
waxed
ever
fiercer
now
ran
beltane
where
stood
roger
to
hold
his
horse
with
ulf
who
leaned
upon
a
goodly
axe
and
young
sir
john
of
griswold
who
clenched
and
wrung
his
mailed
hands
and
bit
upon
his
boyish
lip
and
stamped
in
his
impatience
my
lord
he
cried
my
lord
suffer

but

he
orders
his
line
o
lovely
knight
o
wise

sir

in
his
retreat
he
draweth

athwart
our

of
charge
their
flank
exposed
and
open
to
horse
sir
john
to
horse
yet
stir
not
until
i
give
the
word
forthwith
sprang
sir
john
to
saddle
and
roger
and
ulf
also
what
time
beltane
sat
his
gaze
upon
the
conflict
his
in
his
hand
of
a
sudden
he
clapped
it
to
lip
and
sounded
the
old
fierce
rallying
note
high
and
shrill
and
loud
it
rang
above
the
roar
of
battle
and
lo
distant
and
far
like
an
answer
to
the
call
from
the
grim
and
battered
tower
of
brand
a
mighty
shout
went
up
arise
arise
pentavalon
oho
cried
roger
sitting
close
on
beltane
left
list
ye
to
that
now
and
see
ha
there
cometh
our
walkyn
first
of
them
all
see
how
they
order
their
pikes
o
master
they
be
sweet
and
doughty
fellows
see
how
jenkyn
archers
shoot
each
man
to
the
ear
awhile
sat
beltane
watching
while
sir
benedict
fighting
sword
in
hand
fell
back
and
back
before
the
furious
onset
of
sir
pertolepe
main
battle
until
he
had
drawn
the
fight
then
my
beltane
closed
his
vizor
now
cried
he
now
good
comrades
all
god
willing
we
have
them
let
each
man
choose
his
foe
and
smite
this
day
for
liberty
and
justice
so
saying
he
levelled
his
lance
and
a
hundred
lances
sank
behind
him
spurs
struck
deep
horses
reared
plunged
and
sped
away
before
their
galloping
line
rode
sir
john
of
griswold
with
roger
and
ulf
and
before
these
beltane
he
felt
the
wind
through
the
of
his
casque
heard
the
muffled
thunder
of
the
galloping
hoofs
behind
mingled
with
the
growing
din
of
battle
heard
a
shout
a
roar
of
anger
and
dismay
saw
a
confusion
of
rearing
horses
as
sir
pertolepe
swung
about
to
meet
this
new
attack
steadied
his
aim
and
with
his
hundred
lances
thundering
close
behind
drove
in
upon
those
bristling
ranks
to
meet
them
shield
to
shield
with
desperate
shock
of
onset
felt
his
tough
lance
go
home
with
jarring
crash
saw
horses
that
reared
high
and
were
gone
lost
beneath
the
trampling
fray
and
found
his
lance
shivered
to
the
very
grip
out
flashed
his
sword
for
all
about
him
was
a
staggering
press
of
horses
that
neighed
and
screamed
and
men
who
smote
shouting
and
were
smitten
unseen
blows
battered
him
while
he
thrust
and
hewed
and
wondered
to
see
his
long
blade
so
dimmed
and
bloody
and
ever
as
he
fought
through
the
narrow
vent
of
his
casque
he
caught
small
and
sudden
visions
of
this
desperate
fray
of
ulf
standing
in
his
stirrups
to
ply
his
whirling
axe
whose
mighty
crashing
blows
no
armour
might
withstand
of
grim
roger
scowling
and
fierce
wielding
ponderous
of
young
sir
john
of
griswold
reeling
in
his
saddle
his
helpless
arms
so
cut
they
bloody
path
through
pertolepe
deep
array
on
and
forward
with
darting
point
and
edge
unheeding
wounds
or
shock
of
blows
until
beltane
beheld
the
press
yield
thin
out
and
melt
away
thereupon
shouted
he
hoarse
and
loud
rode
down
a
knight
who
sought
to
bar
his
way
unhorsed
a
second
and
wheeling
his
snorting
charger
wondered
at
the
seeming
quiet
then
lifting
his
vizor
looked
about
him
and
lo
wheresoever
his
glance
fell
were
men
that
crawled
groaning
or
lay
very
mute
and
still
amid
a
huddle
of
fallen
horses
and
beyond
these
again
were
other
men
and
that
galloped
and
ran
amain
for
the
shelter
of
the
green
sir
array
was
scattered
up
and
down
the
valley
the
battle
was
lost
and
won
now
while
he
yet
sat
thus
dazed
by
the
shock
of
blows
and
breathing
deep
of
the
sweet
cool
air
he
beheld
one
rise
up
from
where
the
lay
thickest
an
awful
figure
that
limped
towards
him
holding
aloft
the
broken
shaft
of
an
axe
aha
lord
beltane
cried
ulf
wiping
sweat
and
blood
from
him
there
be
no
more
left
to
smite
see

the
which
is
well
for
weapon

i
none

axe
was
the
third
this
day
broken
see

saw
you
roger
lord
that
is
my
comrade
nay
good
ulf
ha
what
of

afoot
since
when
i
saw

where

sir
benedict
and
walkyn
o
see
you
not
sir
benedict
mine
eyes
are
dazzled
with
the
sun
but
now
ulf
uttered
a
joyful
cry
and
pointed
with
his
yonder
cometh
roger
lord
and
with
him
the
little
archer
but
whom
bring
they
very
slowly
they
came
roger
and
prat
the
archer
betwixt
them
good
sir
hubert
of
erdington
his
harness
hacked
and
broken
his
battered
helm
upon
its
thongs
his
eyes
in
the
pallor
of
his
face
down
sprang
beltane
and
ran
to
greet
him
and
to
catch
his
nerveless
hands
lord
beltane
quoth
he
faintly
full
oft
have
i
shed
my
blood
for
pentavalon
i
die
messire
but
as
thou
didst
say
is
well
to
die
in
cause
so
noble
my
lord
farewell
to
thee
and
with
the
word
even
as
he
stood
roger
and
the
archer
the
stout
old
knight
was
dead
so
they
laid
hubert
of
erdington
very
reverently
upon
that
trampled
field
he
had
maintained
so
well
a
right
noble
knight
my
lord
quoth
prat
shaking
gloomy
head
but
for
him
methinks
our
pikemen
would
have
broke
to
their
third
onset
there
is
no
man
of
you
hath
not
fought
like
ten
men
this
day
said
beltane
leaning
on
his
sword
and
with
head
have
we
lost
many
know
ye
a
fair
good
number
master
as
was
to
be
expected
quoth
roger
cleansing
his
sword
on
a
tuft
of
grass
sir
john
of
griswold
fell
beside
me
through
the
helm
and
what
of
sir
benedict
see
yonder
yonder
he
rides
my
lord
cried
prat
though
methinks
you
scarce
shall
know
him
and
he
pointed
where
on
spent
and
weary
charger
one
rode
a
drooping
languid
figure
his
bright
armour
bespattered
and
dim
his
dinted
casque
smitten
awry
slowly
he
rode
before
his
weary
company
until
of
a
sudden
espying
beltane
he
uttered
a
great
and
glad
cry
his
drooping
shoulders
straightened
and
he
rode
forward
with
mailed
arms
outstretched
beltane
he
cried
praise
be
to
god
one
told
me
thou
wert
down
art
well
sweet
lad
and
all
unharmed
god
is
merciful
and
he
patted
beltane
mailed
shoulder
what
time
blood
oozed
from
his
steel
gauntlet
and
his
sobbing
charger
hung
weary
head
and
snorted
purple
foam
o
lad
quoth
he
smiling
his
wry
smile
here
was
an
hour
worth
living
for
though
sir
bertrand
is
sore
hurt
and
many
do
lie
dead
of
my
company
and
here
sighed
beltane
brave
hubert
of
erdington
behold
a
gallant
knight
beltane
may
i
so
valiantly
die
when
that
my
time
be
come
truly
was
a
sharp
debate
what
time
it
lasted
there
be
many
that
will
ride
with
us
no
more
and
thou
my
lord
cried
beltane
suddenly
thy
cheek
so
pale
hurt
benedict
nought
to
matter
lad
save
that
it
is
my
nay
indeed
my
beltane
was
but
an
axe
bit
through
my
vanbrace
heal
within
the
week
but
take
now
my
horn
and
summon
ye
our
scattered
company
for
i
do
lack
the
wind
knight
and
limping
and
afoot
on
horses
weary
and
blown
they
came
at
the
summons
archer
and
they
came
a
blood
company
many
were
they
that
staggered
faint
with
wounds
and
many
that
sank
upon
the
trampled
grass
with
weariness
but
in
the
eyes
of
each
and
every
was
the
look
of
men
that
triumph
cnut
was
there
his
bascinet
gone
his
fiery
hair
betousled
tall
orson
was
there
leaning
on
a
bent
and
battered
pike
and
there
his
comrade
jenkyn
o
the
ford
with
many
others
that
beltane
well
remembered
and
others
whose
faces
he
knew
not
so
formed
they
their
array
what
time
beltane
viewed
them
with
glowing
eye
and
heart
swelling
within
him
master
cried
tall
orson
of
a
sudden
o
master
us
do
be
clean
men
and
goodly
fighters
as
us
did
promise
thee
time
i
the
hollow
master
ye
mind
us
as
did
promise
so
to
be
i
and
jenkyn
as
be
my
comrade
aye
master
cried
jenkyn
o
the
ford
aye
we
ha
kept
our
word
to
thee
as
we
did
promise
master
so
now
speak
word
to
us
master
ye
men
quoth
beltane
o
my
good
comrades
all
your
deeds
this
day
shall
speak
when
we
are
dust
methinks
your
foes
this
day
did
muster
three
thousand
strong
and
ye
do
number
scarce
a
thousand
yet
have
ye
scattered
them
for
that
your
cause
is
just
is
thus
ye
shall
lift
pentavalon
from
shame
and
give
to
her
peace
at
last
then
tall
orson
shook
aloft
his
battered
pike
and
shouted
amain
and
on
the
instant
others
took
up
the
cry
a
hoarse
roar
that
rolled
from
rank
to
rank
lance
and
sword
axe
and
pike
were
flourished
high
in
air
and
from
these
men
who
had
marched
so
grimly
silent
all
the
day
a
great
and
mighty
shout
went
up
arise
pentavalon
ha
beltane
pentavalon
now
even
as
they
shouted
upon
this
thunderous
roar
there
stole
another
sound
high
and
clear
and
very
sweet
that
rose
and
swelled
upon
the
air
like
the
voices
of
quiring
angels
and
of
a
sudden
the
shouting
was
hushed
as
forth
of
the
tower
gloomy
portal
the
lady
abbess
came
tall
and
fair
and
saintly
in
her
white
habit
her
nuns
behind
her
two
and
two
their
hands
clasped
their
eyes
upraised
to
heaven
chanting
to
god
a
hymn
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
slow
paced
they
thus
the
stately
abbess
with
head
and
slim
hands
clasped
upon
her
silver
crucifix
until
the
chant
being
ended
she
raised
her
head
and
beheld
straightway
sir
benedict
unhelmed
and
yet
astride
his
great
charger
the
silver
crucifix
fell
the
slim
hands
clasped
themselves
upon
her
bosom
and
the
eyes
of
the
tall
white
abbess
grew
suddenly
wide
and
dark
and
even
as
she
gazed
on
him
so
gazed
sir
benedict
on
her
yolande
said
he
and
low
benedict
she
murmured
slowly
sir
benedict
bowed
his
head
and
turning
laid
his
hand
on
beltane
mailed
shoulder
lady
said
he
behold
here
beltane
that
is
son
to
beltane
heretofore
duke
and
lord
of
pentavalon
ah
she
whispered
beltane
and
of
a
sudden
stretched
out
her
arms
in
passionate
yearning
gesture
then
covering
her
face
sank
upon
her
knees
god
pity
me
she
sighed
god
pity
me
thereafter
she
rose
to
her
stately
height
and
looked
on
beltane
gentle
and
my
lord
beltane
said
she
i
have
heard
tell
thou
art
a
noble
knight
strong
yet
gentle
so
should
thy
father
be
greatly
blessed
in
thee
and
thy
mother
also
god
have
thee
ever
in
his
keeping
beltane
now
as
she
spake
the
name
her
soft
voice
brake
and
turning
she
stood
with
head
bowed
upon
her
hands
and
standing
thus
spake
again
and
soft
sir
benedict
we
are
come
to
minister
to
the
hurt
all
is
prepared
within
the
tower
let
them
be
brought
to
us
i
pray
and
my
lord
forget
not
the
sacred
oath
thou
didst
swear
me
long
years
agone
chapter
lviii
how
beltane
had
speech
with
the
abbess
they
found
rich
booty
in
pertolepe
camp
with
store
of
arms
and
armour
and
many
goodly
horses
and
thither
sir
benedict
wearied
followers
betook
them
as
night
fell
and
knew
blessed
rest
and
sleep
but
in
the
tower
of
brand
lights
gleamed
where
the
abbess
and
her
gentle
nuns
went
to
and
fro
among
the
wounded
ministering
to
their
wants
and
far
beyond
the
camp
armour
glinted
ever
and
anon
against
the
blackness
of
the
surrounding
woods
where
outpost
and
sentinel
kept
vigilant
watch
and
ward
though
late
the
hour
beltane
sat
wakeful
chin
on
fist
beside
a
glimmering
oft
turning
his
glance
towards
the
massy
tower
bethinking
him
of
the
noble
lady
abbess
of
her
strange
looks
and
words
and
so
fell
to
brooding
thought
high
overhead
the
moon
rode
obscured
by
flying
clouds
a
wild
wrack
from
the
south
at
fitful
intervals
was
a
wind
that
moaned
drearily
the
gloom
of
distant
woods
a
desolate
sound
that
sobbed
upon
the
air
and
dying
to
a
wail
was
gone
now
becoming
aware
of
this
beltane
raised
his
head
and
looked
up
at
the
ominous
heavens
and
round
about
him
and
thus
he
espied
a
light
that
hovered
hither
and
thither
above
the
distant
a
small
light
whose
red
flame
flashed
back
from
cloven
casque
and
riven
shield
where
eyes
glared
unseeing
and
mouths
gaped
mute
and
dumb
from
a
dark
confusion
whence
mailed
arms
stiffly
rose
with
hands
that
seemed
to
menace
heaven
and
rigid
feet
whose
spurred
heels
yet
gored
the
flanks
of
rigid
fallen
chargers
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
this
small
flame
leaped
merrily
dancing
from
dead
face
to
dead
face
but
staying
never
a
fiendish
fire
that
seemed
to
mock
the
horror
of
wounds
and
gibe
at
solemn
death
now
as
he
watched
this
devilish
light
beltane
arose
and
reaching
for
his
sword
went
to
meet
it
then
paused
for
the
light
was
moving
towards
him
near
and
nearer
it
came
until
into
the
glow
of
the
fire
his
betousled
head
wild
and
bare
his
yet
befouled
with
battle
walkyn
strode
and
hurling
his
torch
upon
the
grass
crushed
it
out
his
heel
then
came
he
to
the
fire
and
stood
there
arms
crossed
frowning
down
at
the
flame
greeting
to
thee
waldron
of
brand
swift
turned
walkyn
his
gloomy
scowl
relaxed
at
beltane
voice
and
stooping
he
took
and
kissed
my
beltane
hand
whence
come
ye
walkyn
from
going
to
and
fro
among
the
dead
seeking
pertolepe

grieve

down
walkyn
here
with
me
beside
the
fire
forthwith
walkyn
obeyed
and
stretching
himself
on
the
grass
fell
to
toying
with
the
haft
of
his
axe
and
scowling
at
the
fire
again
this
was
methinks
thy
father

and
demesne
of

there
and
gui
of

other
noble
knights
but

since

i
all

that
day
and

master
ye
left
him
to
god
on
a
time
and
because
of
thee
i
i
that
had
my
dagger
at
his
rogue
throat
i
yearning
to
slay
him
did
but
mark
him
i
the
brow
aye
forsooth
we
left
him
to
god
and
lo
he
burneth
he
slayeth
and
hangeth
as
was
ever
his
wont
god
time
is
not
ours
walkyn
but
for
the
evil
wrought
by
sir
pertolepe
sir
pertolepe
needs
must
answer
when
god
so
wills
so
leave
him
to
the
vengeance
of
god
lest
the
fire
of
thy
vengeance
consume
thee
quite
thou
art
strong
and
few
may
cope
with
thee
in
fight
yet
hath
vengeance
fettered
and
made
thee
forego
thy
vengeance
then
and
be
free
good
comrade
nay
master
an
i
so
do
what
is
left
me
the
love
of
thy
fellows
walkyn
thou
art
forsooth
a
man
so
do
i
love
thee
and
perchance
within
a
new
pentavalon
thou
come
to
new
fortune
and
honour
thou
shalt
hold
again
thy
father
lands
to
what
end
lord
as
ye
do
know
my
wife
and
child
do
lie
in
nameless
grave
done
to
cruel
death
by
dogs
of
pertolepe
my
brother
rotted
in
a
noose
set
there
by
pertolepe
so
am
i
a
lonely
man
henceforth
one
thing
only
seek
i
of
life
master
and
that
walkyn
the
head
of
bloody
pertolepe
so
saying
walkyn
rose
and
stood
scowling
down
at
the
fire
again
whose
glow
shone
ominous
and
red
upon
the
broad
blade
of
the
mighty
axe
that
lay
on
the
grass
at
his
feet
now
of
a
sudden
forth
from
the
shadows
swift
and
silent
on
his
long
legs
came
crooked
ulf
and
stooping
would
have
lifted
the
weapon
but
in
that
moment
walkyn
snarled
and
set
his
foot
upon
it
off
he
growled
touch
not
mine
axe
thou
vile
mannikin
lest
i
tread
on
thee
but
scarce
were
the
words
spoken
than
with
great
back
ulf
sprang
and
whirling
mighty
walkyn
aloft
mailed
feet
on
high
held
him
writhing
above
the
fire
then
swinging
about
hurled
him
rolling
over
and
over
upon
the
ling
so
lay
walkyn
awhile
propped
on
an
elbow
staring
on
ulf
with
wide
eyes
and
mouth
agape
what
time
strung
for
sudden
action
beltane
sat
upon
the
green
looking
from
one
to
the
other
mannikin
roared
ulf
great
hands
opening
and
shutting
unworthy
to
touch
axe
of
thine
thou
pestilent
beast
dare
ye
so
say
to
one
gently
born
base
fellow
now
will
i
break
thee
thine
accursed
axe
and
thee
thereafter
an
ye
will
so
saying
ulf
the
mighty
caught
up
the
axe
and
wheeling
it
smote
and
buried
it
in
a
young
tree
close
by
wrenched
it
free
and
smote
again
and
lo
with
prodigious
crack
and
rending
of
fibres
the
tall
tree
swayed
crashing
to
earth
now
while
ulf
yet
stood
to
stare
amazed
upon
this
wondrous
axe
upon
its
flawless
edge
walkyn
had
risen
dagger
in
hand
but
even
as
he
crouched
to
spring
a
voice
spake
a
gentle
voice
but
commanding
and
in
the
stood
the
white
abbess
tall
and
gracious
the
silver
crucifix
agleam
upon
her
bosom
children
she
sighed
and
looking
from
scowling
walkyn
to
frowning
ulf
she
reached
a
slim
hand
to
each
o
children
said
she
lay
by
your
steel
and
give
to
me
your
hands
fumbling
and
awkward
walkyn
sheathed
his
dagger
while
ulf
laid
the
mighty
axe
upon
the
grass
very
tenderly
as
it
had
been
a
sleeping
child
so
came
they
both
unto
the
lady
abbess
and
gave
her
each
a
hand
holding
them
thus
she
looked
with
sad
sweet
eyes
from
one
grim
face
to
the
other
and
drew
them
nearer
the
fire
walkyn
son
of
god
said
she
behold
here
ulf
whose
valiant
heart
and
mighty
strength
have
been
our
salvation
ulf
child
of
heaven
whom
god
hath
made
so
mighty
behold
here
brave
walkyn
who
did
protect
the
weak
and
helpless
and
fighteth
for
the
right
come
then
as
ye
are
children
of
god
go
ye
in
brotherly
love
together
henceforth
and
may
heaven
bless
ye
valiant
sons
thus
saying
she
set
their
hands
one
in
another
and
these
hands
gripped
and
held
quoth
ulf
sighing
forsooth
i
did
but
mean
to
try
the
balance
of
thine
axe
walkyn
and
truly
it
is
a
mighty
weapon
and
a
peerless
one
that
even
my
strength
can
not
break
quoth
walkyn
there
is
in
this
world
no
axe
like
unto
it
save
one
that
was
my
brother
and
shall
be
thine
henceforth
ulf
the
strong
come
now
and
i
will
give
it
unto
thee
then
bent
they
reverently
before
the
abbess
saluted
beltane
and
side
by
side
strode
away
together
would
all
feuds
might
so
end
sweet
son
sighed
the
abbess
her
wistful
eyes
upon
the
fire
would
there
were
more
sweet
souls
abroad
to
teach
men
reason
quoth
beltane
why
sit
you
here
my
son
wakeful
and
alone
and
the
hour
so
late
for
that
sleep
doth
fly
my
wooing
holy
mother
then
fain
would
i
share
thy
vigil
awhile
forthwith
beltane
brought
her
a
stool
rough
and
rudely
fashioned
and
while
she
sat
he
lay
beside
her
in
the
firelight
and
thus
despite
her
hood
and
wimple
he
saw
her
face
was
of
a
calm
and
noble
beauty
smooth
and
unwrinkled
despite
the
silver
hair
that
peeped
forth
of
her
loosened
hood
a
while
they
sat
thus
nothing
speaking
he
viewing
her
she
gazing
ever
on
the
fire
at
last
young
messire
she
said
wistfully
yet
in
thy
life
hath
been
much
of
strife
i
heard
thou
hast
known
much
of
hardship
my
son
and
sorrow
methinks
so
do
i
live
for
that
fair
day
when
peace
shall
come
again
noble
lady
full
oft
have
i
heard
tell
of
thee
my
son
strange
tales
and
marvellous
some
do
liken
thee
to
a
demon
joying
in
slaughter
and
some
to
an
archangel
bearing
the
sword
of
god
and
how
think
you
reverend
mother
i
think
of
thee
as
a
man
my
son
i
have
heard
thee
named
and
ravener
and
some
do
call
thee
the
smith
now
wherefore
smith
for
that
smith
was
i
bred
lady
but
of
noble
blood
lord
beltane
yet
knew
i
nought
of
it
until
i
was
man
grown
thy
youth
they
tell
me
hath
been
very
lonely
my
son
and
desolate
not
desolate
for
in
my
loneliness
was
the
hermit
ambrose
who
taught
me
many
things
and
most
of
all
how
to
love
him
so
lived
i
in
the
greenwood
happy
and
content
until
on
a
day
this
saintly
ambrose
told
me
a
woeful
tale
so
did
i
know
this
humble
hermit
for
the
noble
duke
my
father
thy
father
the
duke
a
hermit
told
he
of
all
his
sorrows
my
son
all
reverend
mother
and
thereafter
bade
me
beware
the
falsity
of
women
the
pale
cheek
of
the
abbess
grew
suddenly
suffused
the
slim
hand
clenched
rigid
upon
the
crucifix
at
her
bosom
but
she
stirred
not
nor
lifted
her
sad
gaze
from
the
fire
liveth
thy
father
yet
my
son
is
so
i
pray
god
lady
and
thy
mother
is
so
i
heard
pray
you
not
for
for
her
also
i
never
knew
my
mother
lady
alas
poor
lonely
mother
so
doth
she
need
thy
prayers
the
more
ah
think
you
she
hath
not
perchance
yearned
with
breaking
heart
for
her
babe
to
have
kissed
him
into
rosy
slumber
to
have
cherished
his
boyish
hurts
and
sorrows
to
have
gloried
in
his
youthful
might
and
manhood
o
sure
there
is
no
sorrow
like
the
loneliness
of
desolate
motherhood
seek
this
unknown
mother
lord
beltane
truly
there
be
times
when
i
do
yearn
to
find
her
and
there
be
times
when
i
do
fear
fear
my
lord
holy
mother
i
learned
of
her
first
as
one
false
to
her
vows
and
fickle
from
her
youth
o
hath
there
been
none
to
speak
thee
good
of
her
in
all
these
years
there
was
jolette
that
folk
did
call
a
witch
and
there
is
sir
benedict
that
doth
paint
her
pure
and
noble
as
i
would
have
her
yet
would
i
know
for
myself
fain
would
i
be
sure
ere
we
do
meet
if
she
is
but
the
woman
who
bore
me
or
the
proud
and
noble
mother
i
fain
would
love
not
love
her
first
and
judge
her
after
my
son
could
not
her
very
motherhood
plead
her
cause
with
thee
must
she
be
weighed
in
the
balance
ere
thou
yield
her
a
son
respect
and
love
so
many
weary
years
is
something
hard
methinks
nay
heed
me
not
my
lord
seek
out
thy
mother
unbeknown
prove
for
thyself
her
worthiness
or
falsity
prove
for
thyself
her
honour
or
her
shame
is
but
just
aye
is
but
just
in
very
truth
but
i
beholding
things
with
woman
eyes
know
only
that
a
mother
love
shrinketh
not
for
any
sin
but
reacheth
down
through
shame
and
evil
with
sheltering
arms
outstretched
a
holy
thing
fearless
of
sin
more
lasting
than
shame
and
stronger
than
death
itself
so
saying
the
lady
abbess
rose
and
turned
to
look
up
at
the
lights
that
burned
within
the
tower
is
late
my
lord
she
sighed
get
thee
now
to
thy
rest
for
i
must
begone
to
my
duty
till
the
dawn
there
be
many
sick
and
good
sir
bertrand
lieth
very
nigh
to
death
he
will
see
another
dawn
methinks
so
needs
must
i
away
good
night
sweet
son
and
in
thy
prayers
forget
not
thy
thy
most
unhappy
mother
then
she
lifted
her
hand
and
blessed
him
and
ere
he
rose
up
from
his
knees
she
set
that
white
hand
upon
his
bowed
head
and
touched
his
yellow
hair
a
light
touch
furtive
and
shy
but
a
touch
that
was
like
to
a
caress
thereafter
beltane
coming
into
his
hut
of
woven
wattle
rolled
himself
in
his
mantle
and
presently
fell
to
slumber
chapter
lix
telleth
how
sir
benedict
went
next
day
sir
bertrand
died
of
his
hurts
so
they
buried
him
beside
young
sir
john
of
griswold
and
sturdy
old
hubert
of
erdington
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
five
others
of
their
company
who
had
fallen
in
that
desperate
affray
therefore
tarried
they
a
while
what
time
their
sick
and
wounded
grew
towards
health
and
strength
by
reason
of
the
skill
and
tender
care
of
the
lady
abbess
and
her
nuns
now
on
the
afternoon
of
this
day
sir
benedict
being
sick
of
his
wound
beltane
sat
in
council
among
the
oldest
and
wisest
of
the
knights
and
presently
summoned
walkyn
and
ulf
roger
and
jenkyn
the

this
wise
good
comrades

men
and

and
heedful

and
haste

back
with
tidings
good
or

aye
lord
quoth
the
four
and
master
said
jenkyn
there

my
comrade
orson

tall
his
hurt

nigh
healed
and
to

this
jenkyn
so
now
begone
and
god
speed
ye
good
comrades
all
hereupon
the
mighty
four
made
their
obeisance
and
hasted
away
rejoicing
now
sir
benedict
hurt
had
proved
an
evil
one
and
deep
wherefore
the
abbess
in
accent
soft
and
tender
had
incontinent
ordered
him
to
bed
and
there
within
the
silken
tent
that
had
been
sir
pertolepe
beltane
oft
sat
by
the
while
she
with
slim
and
dexterous
fingers
washed
and
anointed
and
bound
the
ugly
wound
many
times
came
she
gentle
and
gracious
ever
and
at
such
times
beltane
noticed
that
full
often
he
would
find
her
deep
sad
gaze
bent
upon
him
he
noticed
also
that
though
her
voice
was
low
and
gentle
yet
she
spake
ever
as
one
to
obedience
thus
it
was
that
sir
benedict
being
ordered
to
his
couch
obeyed
the
command
but
being
kept
there
all
day
grumbled
albeit
to
beltane
being
kept
there
the
second
day
he
fell
to
muttered
oaths
and
cursing
albeit
to
beltane
but
at
sunset
he
became
unruly
in
so
much
that
he
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
the
lady
abbess
albeit
humbly
whereon
she
smiled
and
bidding
beltane
reach
her
cup
and
spoon
forthwith
mixed
a
decoction
and
dosed
sir
benedict
that
he
fell
asleep
and
slumbered
amain
thus
during
this
time
beltane
saw
and
talked
much
with
the
lady
abbess
oft
went
he
to
watch
her
among
the
sick
and
to
aid
her
when
he
might
saw
how
fierce
faces
softened
when
she
bent
to
touch
fevered
brow
or
speak
them
cheerily
with
smiling
lip
despite
the
deep
and
haunting
sadness
of
her
eyes
saw
how
eagerly
rough
hands
were
stretched
forth
to
furtive
touch
her
white
habit
as
she
passed
heard
harsh
voices
grow
sudden
soft
and
all
unfamiliar
voices
that
broke
in
murmurous
gratitude
all
this
saw
and
heard
he
and
failed
not
morn
and
eve
to
kneel
him
at
her
feet
to
hear
her
bless
him
and
to
feel
that
soft
shy
touch
among
his
hair
so
passed
two
days
but
neither
roger
nor
walkyn
nor
ulf
nor
indeed
any
of
the
twenty
chosen
men
had
yet
returned
or
sent
word
or
sign
wherefore
beltane
began
to
wax
moody
and
anxious
thus
it
was
that
upon
a
sunny
afternoon
he
wandered
beside
a
little
rivulet
bowered
in
alder
and
willow
here
a
merry
brook
that
prattled
over
pebbly
bed
and
laughed
among
stones
and
mossy
boulders
there
a
drowsy
stream
that
widening
to
dreamy
pool
stayed
its
haste
to
woo
branches
with
soft
kissing
noises
now
as
beltane
walked
beside
the
stream
head
and
very
thoughtful
he
paused
of
a
sudden
to
behold
one
richly
dight
in
gambeson
of
leather
artificially
quilted
and
pinked
who
sat
ensconced
within
this
greeny
bower
his
back
to
a
tree
one
bandaged
arm
slung
about
his
neck
and
in
the
other
hand
a
long
trimmed
with
infinite
care
whereunto
a
line
was
tied
sir
benedict
cried
beltane
methought
thee
asleep
what
do
ye
so
far
from
camp
and
bed
i
fish
lad
i
fish
i
ply
a
tentative
angle
nay
save
thy
breath
i
have
caught
me
nothing
yet
save
thoughts
thoughts
do
flock
a
many
but
as
to
fish
they
do
but
sniff
my
bait
and
flirt
it
with
their
wanton
tails
plague
take
but
what
o
fish
is
not
for
fish
alone
that
man
fisheth
for
fishing
begetteth
thought
and
thought
dreams
and
to
dream
is
sweet
but
benedict
what
of
the
abbess
the
abbess
ha
the
abbess
beltane
sweet
soul
she
sleepeth
at
noon
each
day
needs
must
she
sleep
since
even
she
is
mortal
and
mortals
must
sleep
now
and
then
the
abbess
come
sit
ye
lad
what
time
i
tickle
the
noses
of
these
pestilent
fish
sit
ye
here
beside
me
and
tell
me
how
think
ye
of
this
noble
and
most
sweet
lady
that
for
thy
truancy
she
will
incontinent
mix
thee
another
sleeping
draught
benedict
ha
then
i
never
drink
it
quoth
sir
benedict
settling
his
shoulder
against
beltane
and
frowning
at
his
line
am
i
a
babe
forsooth
to
be
dosed
to
slumber
ha
by
the
foul
fiend
his
black
dam
will
i
drink
it
lad
then
will
she
smile
on
thee
and
set
it
to
thy
lip
and
woo
thee
so
shalt
thou
swallow
it
every
drop
not
so
dear
blood
of
all
the
saints
must
i
be
mewed
up
within
an
accursed
bed
on
such
a
day
and
all
by
reason
of
a
small
malediction
no
she
is
wondrous
gentle
with
the
sick
benedict
she
is
a
very
woman
beltane
and
therefore
gentle
a
noble
lady
sweet
of
soul
and
body
to
die
for
such
were
joyful
privilege
methinks
aye
verily
and
sir
benedict
forgetful
of
his
line
drooped
his
head
and
sighed
and
thou
didst
know
her
well
long
years
agone
benedict
aye
long
years
agone
very
well
benedict
very
well
she
was
then
benedict
aye
quoth
sir
benedict
lifting
his
head
with
a
start
and
looking
at
beltane
askance
and
she
is
the
lady
abbess
veronica
that
shall
surely
dose
thee
again
and
ha
bones
and
body
o
me
not
so
for
here
sit
i
and
here
angle
i
fish
or
no
fish
thunder
o
god
yes
aye
verily
here
will
i
sit
till
i
have
caught
me
a
fish
or
weary
and
go
o
my
own
free
will
by
beelzebub
i
vow
by
bel
and
the
dragon
i
swear
it
and
furthermore
sir
benedict
paused
tilted
his
head
and
glancing
up
beheld
the
lady
abbess
within
a
yard
of
them
gracious
she
stood
in
her
long
white
habit
and
shook
her
stately
head
in
grave
rebuke
but
beholding
his
abashed
look
and
how
the
rod
sagged
in
his
loosened
hold
her
lips
parted
of
a
sudden
and
her
teeth
gleamed
in
a
smile
wondrous
young
and
pleasant
to
see
o
benedict
said
she
o
child
most
disobedient
o
sir
knight
is
this
thy
chivalry
noble
lord
to
steal
away
for
that
a
poor
soul
must
needs
sleep
being
alas
so
very
mortal
forsooth
and
indeed
dear
my
lady
quoth
sir
benedict
fumbling
with
his
angle
the
sun
did
woo
me
forth
and
the
wind
see
you
the
wind
nay
i
see
it
not
my
lord
but
i
did
hear
something
of
thy
fearsome
great
oaths
as
i
came
hither
oaths
lady
said
sir
benedict
fingering
his
chin
forsooth
and
did
i
so
mayhap
was
by
reason
that
the
fish
see
you
the
pestilent
fish
ha
saint
benedict
i
have
a
bite
up
sprang
sir
benedict
quite
forgetting
his
wounded
arm
capering
lightly
to
and
fro
now
in
the
water
now
out
with
prodigious
stir
and
splash
and
swearing
oaths
galore
until
his
pallid
cheek
flushed
and
bright
eyes
he
had
won
the
fish
into
the
shallows
and
thence
landed
it
right
skilfully
where
it
thrashed
and
leapt
flashing
in
the
sun
ha
yolande
he
cried
in
the
golden
days
thou
wert
ever
fond
of
a
goodly
trout
fresh
caught
and
broiled
upon
a
fire
of
benedict
cried
the
abbess
and
all
forgetful
of
his
hurt
caught
him
by
his
wounded
arm
o
sir
benedict
now
man
of
iron
though
he
seemed
sir
benedict
must
needs
start
and
flinch
beneath
her
hold
and
grow
livid
by
reason
of
the
sharp
pain
of
it
whereat
she
loosed
him
of
a
sudden
and
fell
away
white
hands
tight
clasped
together
ah
benedict
i
have
hurt
thee
again
she
panted
not
so
was
when
i
landed
the
fish
my
lady
abbess
now
at
this
she
turned
away
and
standing
thus
awhile
very
silent
presently
raised
her
hand
whereat
came
two
of
her
gentle
nuns
dear
my
daughters
said
she
take
now
sir
benedict
unto
the
camp
and
look
to
his
hurt
anoint
it
as
ye
have
seen
me
do
go
nothing
speaking
sir
benedict
bowed
him
humbly
to
the
stately
abbess
and
went
away
between
the
two
sisters
and
so
was
gone
slowly
the
abbess
turned
to
beltane
who
had
risen
and
was
regarding
her
with
a
new
and
strange
intensity
and
meeting
that
look
her
own
glance
wavered
sank
and
she
stood
awhile
gazing
down
into
the
murmurous
waters
and
as
she
stood
thus
aware
of
his
eyes
into
her
pale
cheek
crept
a
flush
that
deepened
and
ever
deepened
my
lord
said
she
very
low
and
why
dost
thou
look
on
me
so
and
for
all
her
stately
calm
her
hand
which
had
clenched
itself
upon
the
silver
crucifix
was
woefully
what
is
it
my
lord
beltane
a
thought
noble
lady
what
is
thy
thought
lady
is
this
that
an
i
might
find
a
mother
such
as
thee
then
would
i
pay
her
homage
on
my
knees
and
love
her
and
honour
her
for
what
i
do
know
her
praying
god
to
make
me
worthy
so
saying
he
came
a
step
towards
her
faltered
stopped
and
reached
out
appealing
hands
to
her
from
red
to
white
and
from
white
to
red
again
the
colour
flushed
in
cheek
and
brow
while
the
abbess
hearkened
to
his
words
then
she
looked
on
him
with
proud
head
uplifted
and
in
her
eyes
a
great
and
wondrous
light
quick
and
passionate
her
slim
hands
came
out
to
meet
his
a
sudden
clamour
in
the
air
a
clash
of
arms
a
running
of
swift
feet
and
walkyn
sprang
betwixt
them
his
face
grimed
with
dust
and
sweat
his
armour
gone
his
great
axe
all
bloody
in
his
hand
master
he
cried
in
winisfarne
lieth
pertolepe
with
over
a
thousand
of
his
company
i
judge
and
in
the
woods
here
and
winisfarne
is
hollo
of
revelsthorne
marching
on
us
through
the
woods
with
full
five
thousand
of
ivo
picked
levies
new
come
from
barham
broom
chapter
lx
telleth
how
they
marched
from
the
valley
of
brand
within
the
camp
was
prodigious
stir
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
and
hoarse
commands
where
archers
and
pikemen
knights
and
were
mustering
but
nowhere
was
hurry
or
confusion
wherefore
heart
rejoiced
and
he
smiled
as
he
came
where
before
sir
benedict
and
the
assembled
council
stood
roger
and
ulf
with
fifteen
of
their
twenty
men
walkyn
said
sir
benedict
what
time
his
esquire
strapped
and
buckled
him
into
his
bright
armour
do
they
hold
their
march
scarce
twenty
miles
from
here
due
west
lord
ha
and
they
come
through
the
forest
ye
say
questioned
sir
brian
so
shall
they
move
more
slowly
methinks
why
see
you
messire
said
walkyn
they
march
by
way
of
felindre
that
was
once
a
fair
town
and
from
felindre
is
a
road
that
leadeth
through
the
wild
unto
this
valley
of
brand
so
have
we
i
judge
six
and
seven
hours
quoth
hacon
of
trant
less
hacon
less
said
sir
benedict
beginning
to
stride
up
and
down
in
his
clanking
armour
sir
rollo
ever
rideth
with
busy
spur
and
he
will
doubtless
push
on
amain
nor
spare
his
men
that
he
may
take
us
unprepared
put
it
at
five
hours
hacon
mayhap
less
is
so
i
pray
said
beltane
glancing
towards
the
glowing
west
and
in
two
hours
it
will
be
dark
my
lords
walkyn
thy
company
doth
lack
for
five
meseemeth
aye
master
for
five
two
fell
in
winisfarne
where
i
lay
in
bonds
other
three
were
slain
in
the
pursuit
saw
sir
rollo
aught
of
thee
nay
lord
we
lay
well
hid
is
very
well
are
they
many
of
horsemen
i
counted
full
three
thousand
master
and
i
lord
quoth
ulf
did
reckon
over
two
thousand
foot
is
a
fairish
company
said
sir
brian
and
i
do
lack
my
sighed
sir
benedict
but
my
left
hath
served
me
well
ere
now
and
sir
pertolepe
lieth
yet
in
winisfarne
said
beltane
thoughtfully
aye
nodded
sir
benedict
and
shall
march
south
to
cut
off
our
retreat
if
haply
any
of
us
escape
sir
rollo
onfall
so
should
we
strike
camp
and
march
forthright
said
sir
brian
march
aye
but
whither
questioned
sir
hacon
we
are
threatened
on
two
fronts
and
for
the
rest
we
have
the
trackless
wilderness
whither
march
brian
south
to
belsaye
answered
sir
benedict
south
through
the
wild
until
we
strike
the
western
road
by
thornaby
i
with
certain
others
will
form
a
and
hold
sir
rollo
in
play
what
time
our
main
body
presses
on
at
speed
ha
quoth
sir
hacon
and
what
of
red
pertolepe
truly
our
case
is
desperate
methinks
old
comrade
why
is
not
the
first
time
we
have
desperate
odds
hacon
aye
verily
benedict
thy
cool
head
and
cunning
strategy
have
saved
us
from
dungeon
and
death
a
score
of
times
but
then
were
we
a
chosen
company
swift
at
onfall
or
retreat
well
mounted
and
equipped
we
go
hampered
with
our
wounded
and
these
lady
nuns
so
is
our
case
desperate
benedict
and
needeth
desperate
remedy
and
that
methinks
i
found
messire
quoth
beltane
and
rising
up
he
looked
upon
them
all
his
eye
bright
with
sudden
purpose
hark
ye
my
lords
great
and
valiant
knights
do
i
know
ye
one
and
all
wise
in
experience
of
battle
and
much
versed
in
warlike
stratagem
beyond
my
understanding
but
this
is
the
where
only
shall
advantage
us
within
these
wilds
your
tactics
shall
avail
nothing
nor
all
your
trampling
chivalry
here
must
be
foresters
that
may
go
silent
and
unseen
amid
the
leaves
whose
trained
feet
no
twig
shall
snap
who
smite
unseen
from
brush
and
thicket
and
being
wise
in
thus
make
the
forest
their
ally
and
lords
i
am
a
forester
all
my
days
the
greenwood
hath
been
my
home
and
in
my
loneliness
i
made
the
trees
my
friends
so
i
pray
you
let
me
with
three
hundred
chosen
foresters
keep
our
rear
and
this
night
the
forest
shall
fight
for
us
and
sir
rollo
rue
the
hour
he
dared
adventure
him
within
the
green
messires
how
say
you
why
my
lord
is
very
well
sighed
sir
benedict
glancing
down
at
his
wounded
arm
i
for
one
do
agree
right
heartily
and
i
nodded
sir
brian
and
i
also
quoth
sir
hacon
though
is
a
far
cry
to
belsaye
and
i
love
not
to
be
pent
within
walls
and
with
red
pertolepe
threatening
our
flank
is
a
very
parlous
case
methinks
and
thou
art
ever
at
thy
best
where
danger
is
hacon
said
sir
benedict
so
will
i
give
thee
charge
of
our
now
hereupon
sir
hacon
gloom
vanished
and
rising
up
he
smiled
and
forthwith
did
on
his
great
then
it
is
agreed
said
beltane
and
beckoned
to
roger
and
walkyn
quoth
he
good
friends
go
now
and
choose
three
hundred
trusty
fellows
skilled
foresters
all
look
that
each
doth
bear
flint
and
steel
for
by
yon
clouds
i
judge
be
a
dark
night
let
every
fire
within
the
camp
be
quenched
and
the
ground
well
cooled
with
water
that
by
the
feel
of
it
none
may
know
how
long
we
have
removed
see
you
to
this
ulf
now
when
the
mighty
three
were
gone
about
the
business
their
fifteen
lusty
fellows
at
their
heels
beltane
turned
and
pointed
westward
and
lo
the
sun
was
set
messires
said
he
you
were
wise
methinks
to
mount
and
away
ere
the
night
fall
since
the
moon
is
hid
be
very
dark
amid
the
trees
therefore
let
orson
guide
you
he
is
and
well
knoweth
the
way
to
thornaby
heaven
prosper
you
for
in
your
valiant
keeping
is
the
safety
of
of
our
noble
lady
abbess
and
her
ladies
so
mount
my
lords
press
on
with
what
speed
ye
may
and
god
aid
us
this
night
each
and
every
fare
ye
well
presently
the
trumpets
sounded
and
forthwith
armour
was
buckled
on
horses
saddled
while
everywhere
was
stir
and
bustle
of
departure
what
time
within
his
osier
hut
my
beltane
was
busily
doing
on
his
armour
and
being
in
haste
making
slow
business
of
it
thrice
he
essayed
to
buckle
a
certain
strap
and
thrice
it
escaped
him
when
lo
came
a
slim
white
hand
to
do
it
for
him
and
turning
he
beheld
the
lady
abbess
and
in
her
eyes
was
yet
that
soft
and
radiant
look
but
nought
said
she
until
beltane
stood
armed
from
head
to
heel
until
she
had
girt
the
great
sword
about
him
then
she
set
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
beltane
said
she
thou
didst
yearn
for
thy
mother
so
is
she
come
to
thee
at
last
dear
son
so
saying
she
drew
him
down
into
her
embrace
o
beltane
son
of
mine
long
long
have
i
waited
aye
bitter
weary
years
and
in
my
sorrow
i
have
dreamed
of
this
hour
the
arms
about
thee
are
thy
mother
arms
now
fell
beltane
upon
his
knees
and
caught
those
white
and
gentle
hands
and
kissed
them
quoth
he
mother
o
dear
my
mother
did
i
know
how
deep
had
been
my
need
of
thee
until
now
and
yet
all
unknowing
i
have
yearned
for
thee
in
my
youth
i
did
love
all
sweet
and
gentle
things
in
thy
stead
the
trees
the
tender
flowers
the
murmurous
brooks
these
did
i
love
in
place
of
thee
for
that
mine
heart
did
yearn
and
hunger
for
a
tender
love
here
needs
must
she
stoop
all
soft
whispers
and
tender
to
kiss
him
oft
to
lay
her
cheek
upon
his
golden
head
and
murmur
over
him
and
thou
wilt
love
thy
mother
beltane
thou
wilt
love
thy
unknown
mother
now
and
always
for
that
she
is
thy
mother
i
will
love
her
and
honour
her
now
and
always
for
that
my
mother
is
a
sweet
and
noble
woman
and
thou
didst
need
me
beltane
in
thy
lonely
childhood
thou
didst
need
me
and
i
o
god
pity
me
i
was
far
from
thee
but
dear
my
son
because
i
could
not
cherish
thee
within
these
arms
i
strove
to
love
and
cherish
all
motherless
children
for
thy
dear
sake
and
to
grieve
for
all
sorrowing
mothers
so
builded
i
the
nunnery
at
winisfarne
and
there
sought
to
bring
solace
and
comfort
to
desolate
hearts
because
my
heart
was
so
desolate
for
thee
my
babe
my
beltane
and
i
have
prayed
unceasing
unto
god
and
he
in
his
infinite
mercy
hath
given
thee
to
my
arms
again
a
trumpet
brayed
harsh
and
loud
near
by
whereat
those
tender
drew
him
closer
yet
within
their
sheltering
embrace
sweet
son
she
sighed
methinks
death
is
very
near
each
one
of
us
but
i
have
held
thee
to
my
heart
have
felt
thy
kisses
and
heard
thy
loving
words
now
if
death
come
how
shall
it
avail
such
love
as
ours
sir
benedict
telleth
me
thou
hast
chosen
the
post
of
danger
is
so
i
would
have
it
dear
my
son
and
thy
proud
prayers
go
with
thee
god
keep
thee
o
god
keep
thee
my
beltane
ah
there
sounds
again
the
clarion
bidding
me
from
thee
kiss
now
thy
mother
farewell
for
alas
i
must
be
gone
so
presently
beltane
brought
the
abbess
where
stood
sir
benedict
with
an
jennet
for
her
use
and
his
company
formed
up
in
column
beyond
the
camp
then
beltane
lifted
the
lady
abbess
to
the
saddle
and
with
her
hand
yet
clasped
in
his
reached
the
other
to
sir
benedict
my
lord
of
bourne
said
he
dear
my
friend
to
thy
care
i
give
this
lady
abbess
duchess
of
pentavalon
my
and
noble
mother
o
benedict
no
prouder
son
than
i
in
all
the
world
methinks
nor
one
so
humble
god
send
we
meet
again
anon
but
now
fare
ye
well
saying
the
which
beltane
caught
his
mother
hand
to
his
lips
and
turning
him
suddenly
about
hasted
to
roger
and
walkyn
and
the
chosen
three
hundred
and
in
a
while
the

column
moved
forward
up
the
slope
first
rode
sir
hacon
and
his
knights
in
the
van
and
last
sir
benedict
with
his
grim
to
form
a
while
archers
and
pikemen
marched
upon
their
flanks
with
ring
of
steel
with
jingle
of
stirrup
and
they
swung
away
up
the
slope
and
plunging
into
the
gloom
of
the
forest
were
gone
only
sir
benedict
paused
to
turn
in
his
saddle
and
lift
unwounded
arm
in
salutation
ere
he
too
vanished
into
the
shadows
of
the
awhile
stood
beltane
before
the
three
hundred
his
head
bowed
as
one
in
meditation
until
the
sound
of
voices
the
ring
and
clash
of
their
companions
going
was
died
away
then
looked
he
at
the
cloudy
sky
already
deepening
to
evening
and
round
about
upon
the
encircling
woods
the
wind
is
from
the
south
methinks
said
he
aye
master
nodded
walkyn
quoth
roger
now
came
beltane
and
looked
upon
his
company
tall
lusty
fellows
they
whose
bold
faces
proclaimed
them
free
men
of
the
and
beholding
their
hardy
look
beltane
eye
brightened
comrades
quoth
he
we
be
foresters
all
and
the
our
home
and
playground
but
yonder
from
the
west
do
march
full
five
thousand
of
duke
ivo
knights
and
they
of
courts
of
town
and
city
so
now
will
we
teach
them
is
an
ill
thing
to
adventure
them
trained
foresters
within
the
green
list
now
and
mark
me
well
for
an
our
plan
do
fail
there
shall
few
of
us
live
to
see
sun
then
beltane
spake
them
plain
and
to
the
point
insomuch
that
when
all
was
said
these
hardy
foresters
stood
mute
awhile
desperate
fellows
though
they
were
then
laughed
they
fierce
and
loud
and
flourished
sword
and
and
so
fell
to
clamourous
talk
now
did
beltane
divide
the
three
hundred
into
five
companies
of
sixty
over
the
first
company
he
set
walkyn
over
the
second
roger
over
the
third
ulf
over
the
fourth
jenkyn
o
the
ford
then
spake
he
on
this
wise
walkyn
take
now
these
sixty
good
fellows
and
march
you
yonder
across
the
valley
let
your
men
lie
well
hid
a
within
the
forest
but
do
you
stay
upon
the
verge
of
the
forest
and
watch
for
the
coming
of
our
foes
and
when
they
be
come
is
sure
they
will
plant
outposts
and
sentinels
within
the
green
so
be
ye
wary
to
smite
outpost
and
sentinel
suddenly
and
that
none
may
hear
within
the
camp
nor
take
alarm
when
is
done
cry
you
thrice
like
unto
a
curlew
that
we
may
know
are
all
things
understood
aye
lord
they
cried
one
and
all
why
then
be
ye
cautious
each
and
every
for
an
our
foes
do
take
alarm
so
shall
it
be
our
death
march
walkyn
away
forthwith
walkyn
lifted
his
axe
and
strode
off
up
the
slope
until
he
and
his
sixty
men
had
vanished
quite
into
the
glooming
woods
to
the
jenkyn
didst
hear
my
commands
to
walkyn
so
shalt
thou
do
also
your
post
doth
lie
to
the
east
yonder
aye
master
and
now
my
signal
shall
be
three
master
so
saying
jenkyn
turned
his
sixty
at
his
heels
and
swung
away
until
they
were
lost
to
sight
in
the
woods
to
the
east
ulf
the
strong
thy
post
doth
lie
and
thus
i
lying
south
shall
have
ye
on
my
left
and
right
go
get
ye
to
your
places
watch
ye
and
wait
in
patience
for
the
signals
and
when
time
for
action
cometh
be
swift
and
sure
away
marched
roger
and
ulf
with
their
companies
and
presently
were
gone
and
there
remained
within
the
little
valley
only
beltane
and
his
sixty
men
awhile
he
stood
to
look
to
the
north
and
east
and
west
but
nought
saw
he
save
the
dense
gloom
of
forest
growing
dark
and
ever
darker
with
evening
then
of
a
sudden
turned
he
and
summoning
his
company
strode
away
into
the
forest
to
the
south
thus
as
night
fell
the
valley
of
brand
lay
deserted
quite
and
no
sound
brake
the
pervading
quiet
save
the
wind
that
moaned
feebly
through
those
dark
and
solitary
woods
wherein
death
lay
hid
so
very
silent
so
very
patient
but
death
in
grim
and
awful
shape
chapter
lxi
how
the
forest
fought
for
them
a
hum
upon
the
lost
ever
and
anon
in
wailing
gust
yet
a
hum
that
never
ceased
a
sound
that
grew
and
grew
loud
and
ever
more
loud
until
it
seemed
to
fill
the
very
night
a
dreadful
sound
ominous
and
threatening
a
sound
to
shake
the
boldest
heart
the
ring
and
tramp
of
an
armed
oncoming
multitude
now
lying
amid
the
leaves
and
fern
with
cnut
and
the
small
man
prat
beside
him
beltane
presently
espied
certain
figures
moving
in
the
valley
below
stealthy
figures
that
were
men
of
sir
rollo
they
approached
the
deserted
camp
they
entered
it
and
suddenly
their
trumpets
brayed
loud
and
long
and
dying
away
gave
place
to
the
ring
and
trampling
thunder
of
the
advancing
host
on
they
came
knights
and
rank
upon
rank
company
by
company
until
the
valley
seemed
full
of
the
dull
gleam
of
their
armour
and
the
air
rang
loud
with
clash
and
jingle
and
the
trample
of
countless
hooves
yet
still
they
came
horsemen
and
and
ever
the
sound
of
them
waxed
upon
the
air
a
harsh
confused
din
and
ever
from
the
glooming
woods
above
death
stared
down
on
them
and
now
the
trumpets
blew
amain
lights
flickered
and
flared
as
one
by
one
fires
were
lighted
whose
red
glow
flashed
back
from
many
a
helm
and
shield
and
from
broad
gisarm
and
twinkling
what
time
above
the
confused
hum
above
stamping
hooves
and
clashing
armour
voices
shouted
hoarse
commands
so
little
by
little
from
chaos
order
was
wrought
and
charger
were
led
away
to
be
watered
and
picketed
and
gleaming
figures
sank
wearily
about
the
many
where
food
was
already
preparing
in
a
while
from
the
stir
of
the
camp
bright
with
its
many
divers
small
groups
of
men
were
detached
and
pike
and
gisarm
on
shoulder
began
to
mount
toward
the
forest
at
varying
points
hereupon
beltane
reached
out
in
the
dark
and
touched
the
small
man
prat
the
archer
quoth
he
hither
come
their
outposts
go
now
and
bring
up
my
company
and
bid
them
come
silently
forthwith
prat
sank
down
among
the
fern
and
was
gone
while
beltane
watched
where
four
men
of
sir
hollo
outposts
climbed
the
slope
hard
by
and
one
was
singing
and
one
was
cursing
and
two
were
quarrelling
and
all
four
beltane
judged
were
men
aweary
with
long
marching
thus
singing
cursing
quarrelling
came
they
to
keep
their
ward
within
these
dark
and
silent
woods
crashing
through
the
underbrush
careless
of
their
going
and
all
unheeding
the
sombre
stealthy
forms
that
rose
up
so
silently
behind
them
and
before
from
brush
and
brake
and
thicket
creeping
figures
that
moved
only
when
the
moaned
in
the
shivering
leaves
beltane
dagger
was
out
and
he
rose
up
from
the
fern
crouched
and
strung
for
action
but
from
the
gloom
near
by
rose
a
sudden
strange
flurry
amid
the
leaves
a
whimpering
sound
evil
to
hear
and
swiftly
ended
a
groan
a
cry
choked
to
strangling
gasp
and
thereafter
silence
save
for
the
fitful
wailing
of
the
wind
a
long
breathless
pause
then
high
and
clear
rose
the
cry
of
an
owl
thrice
repeated
and
presently
small
prat
was
beside
him
in
the
fern
again
lord
said
he
softly
albeit
panting
a
little
these
men
were
fools
we
do
but
wait
our
comrades
signals
now
and
he
fell
to
cleansing
his
carefully
with
a
handful
of
bracken
ha
list
ye
whispered
cnut
there
sounds
ulf
warning
methinks
and
from
the
gloom
on
their
left
a
frog
croaked
hoarsely
a
hundred
blazed
in
the
valley
below
and
around
each
fire
armour
glittered
little
by
little
the
great
camp
grew
to
silence
and
rest
until
nought
was
heard
but
the
stamp
and
snorting
of
the
many
horses
and
the
cries
of
the
sentinels
below
but
ever
dagger
in
hand
beltane
strained
eyes
and
ears
northward
across
the
valley
while
big
cnut
bit
his
nails
and
wriggled
beside
him
in
the
bracken
and
small
prat
softly
snapped
his
fingers
so
waited
they
with
ears
on
the
stretch
and
eyes
that
glared
ever
to
the
north
at
last
faint
and
far
across
the
valley
rose
the
doleful
cry
of
a
curlew
thrice
repeated
the
which
was
answered
from
the
east
by
the
hooting
of
an
owl
which
again
was
caught
up
like
an
echo
and
repeated
thrice
upon
their
right
then
beltane
sheathed
his
dagger
look
said
he
cnut
prat
look
north
and
tell
me
what
ye
see
fire
my
lord
quoth
prat
ha
it
burneth
well
see
see
how
it
spreads
and
there
again
in
the
east
said
cnut
oho
jenkyn
is
busy
look
master
aye
and
roger
too
said
beltane
our
ring
of
fire
is
complete
it
lacketh
but
for
us
and
ulf
to
work
then
came
the
sound
of
flint
meeting
steel
a
sound
that
spread
along
the
ranks
that
lay
unseen
beyond
prat
and
cnut
and
behold
a
spark
a
glow
a
little
flame
that
died
down
leapt
up
caught
upon
dry
grass
and
bracken
seized
upon
crackling
twigs
flared
up
high
and
ever
fiercer
a
devouring
flame
hungry
and
that
licked
along
the
earth
a
vengeful
flame
pitiless
and
unrelenting
a
host
of
fiery
demons
that
leapt
and
danced
with
crackling
laughter
changing
little
by
little
to
an
angry
roar
that
was
the
voice
of
awful
doom
now
of
a
sudden
above
the
hiss
of
flame
from
the
valley
of
brand
a
cry
went
up
a
shout
a
roar
of
fear
and
amaze
and
thereafter
rose
a
wild
clamour
a
babel
inarticulate
split
ever
and
anon
by
frantic
but
ever
the
dreadful
hubbub
waxed
and
grew
shrieks
and
cries
and
the
screaming
of
maddened
horses
with
the
awful
rolling
thunder
of
their
hooves
within
that
valley
of
doom
death
was
abroad
already
death
in
many
dire
shapes
proud
knights
doughty
archers
and
who
had
fronted
death
unmoved
on
many
a
stricken
field
wept
aloud
and
crouched
upon
their
knees
and
screamed
but
not
so
loud
as
those
wild
and
maddened
horses
that
bursting
all
bonds
asunder
reared
and
leapt
with
lashing
hooves
and
choked
with
rolling
blinded
by
flame
plunged
headlong
through
and
over
the
doomed
camp
wave
upon
wave
of
heads
and
tossing
manes
on
they
came
with
nought
to
let
or
stay
them
their
wild
hooves
trampling
down
hut
of
osier
and
silken
tent
spurning
the
trembling
earth
and
filling
the
air
with
flying
clods
and
wheresoever
they
galloped
there
was
flame
to
meet
them
so
swerved
they
screaming
their
terror
and
fled
round
and
round
within
the
valley
so
raced
they
blindly
to
and
fro
and
back
and
forth
trampling
down
maiming
and
mangling
reddened
cruel
hooves
all
and
every
that
chanced
to
lie
athwart
their
wild
career
on
and
ever
on
they
galloped
until
sobbing
panting
they
fell
to
be
crushed
the
thundering
hooves
behind
within
the
little
valley
of
brand
death
was
rife
in
many
and
awful
shapes
that
no
eye
might
see
for
the
many
were
scattered
and
trampled
out
but
up
from
that
pit
of
doom
rose
shrieks
and
cries
and
many
hateful
sounds
sounds
to
pierce
the
brain
and
ring
there
everlastingly
thus
beltane
marching
swift
to
the
south
at
the
head
of
his
three
hundred
foresters
heard
nought
of
their
joyful
acclaim
heeded
not
their
triumph
saw
nought
of
watchful
roger
troubled
glances
but
went
with
head
bowed
low
with
pallid
cheek
and
eyes
for
he
saw
yet
again
the
fierce
leap
of
those
merciless
flames
and
in
his
ears
rang
the
screams
and
cries
of
sir
rollo
proud
chivalry
chapter
lxii
how
they
came
to
belsaye
for
the
third
time
the
sun
was
high
as
they
came
to
the
western
road
that
led
to
the
ford
at
thornaby
but
upon
the
edge
of
the
forest
beltane
stopped
of
a
sudden
to
stare
up
at
an
adjacent
tree
what
master
questioned
roger
halting
beside
him
an
arrow
and
by
the
look
of
it
said
beltane
gloomily
aye
master
and
it
hath
travelled
far
see
it
hath
scarce
pierced
the
bark
was
shot
from
the
brush
yonder
methinks
said
beltane
pointing
to
the
dense
underwood
that
skirted
the
opposite
side
of
the
dusty
highway
reach
me
it
down
roger
so
saying
beltane
stooped
and
hove
roger
aloft
until
he
could
grasp
and
draw
the
arrow
from
the
tree
here
is
no
woodsman
shaft
master
quoth
roger
turning
the
missile
over
in
his
hand
ere
he
gave
it
to
beltane
no
forester
doth
wing
his
shafts
so
true
nodded
beltane
frowning
at
the
arrow
walkyn
ulf
here
hath
been
an
ambushment
methinks
is
a
likely
place
for
such
let
our
company
scatter
and
search
amid
the
fern
hereabouts
but
even
as
he
spake
came
a
cry
a
clamour
of
voices
and
prat
the
archer
came
frowning
and
snapping
his
restless
fingers
my
lord
said
he
yonder
doth
lie
my
good
comrade
martin
and
three
other
fellows
of
my
that
marched
with
sir
benedict
and
all
dead
lord
slain
by
arrows
all
four
show
me
said
beltane
and
when
he
had
viewed
and
touched
those
stark
and
pallid
forms
that
lay
scattered
here
and
there
amid
the
bracken
his
anxious
frown
deepened
these
have
been
dead
men
full
six
hours
quoth
he
aye
lord
says
prat
and
is
unmeet
such
good
fellows
should
lie
here
for
beasts
to
tear
shall
we
bury
them
not
so
answered
beltane
turning
away
take
their
shafts
and
fall
to
your
ranks
we
must
march
forthright
thus
soon
the
three
hundred
were
striding
fast
behind
beltane
keeping
ever
to
the
forest
yet
well
within
of
the
road
and
though
they
travelled
at
speed
they
went
very
silently
as
only
foresters
might
in
a
while
beltane
brought
them
to
those
high
wooded
banks
betwixt
which
the
road
ran
winding
down
to
thornaby
ford
that
hilly
road
where
upon
a
time
the
red
pertolepe
had
surprised
the
lawless
company
of
gilles
of
brandonmere
and
now
as
then
the
dark
defile
was
littered
with
the
wrack
of
fight
fallen
charges
that
kicked
and
snorted
in
their
pain
or
lay
mute
and
still
men
in
battered
harness
that
stared
up
from
the
dust
all
unseeing
upon
the
new
day
they
lay
thick
within
the
sunken
road
but
thicker
beside
the
ford
and
they
dotted
the
white
road
beyond
grim
signs
of
sir
benedict
stubborn
retreat
hereupon
beltane
halted
his
foresters
and
bidding
them
rest
awhile
and
break
their
fast
hasted
down
into
the
roadway
with
walkyn
and
cnut
and
black
roger
aha
cried
walkyn
pointing
to
divers
of
the
slain
that
hampered
their
going
these
be
pertolepe
rogues
aye
quoth
roger
throwing
back
his
and
yonder
lie
four
five
six
of
sir
benedict
good
fellows
it
hath
been
a
dour
fight
hereabouts
they
have
fought
every
yard
of
the
way
forsooth
nodded
cnut
sir
benedict
is
ever
most
fierce
when
he
retreats
look
you
a
while
stood
beltane
in
that
dark
defile
the
which
untouched
as
jet
by
the
sun
level
beams
struck
dank
and
chill
a
place
of
gloom
and
awful
silence
so
stood
he
glancing
from
one
still
form
to
another
twice
he
knelt
to
look
more
closely
on
the
dead
and
each
time
he
rose
thereafter
his
brow
was
blacker
and
he
shivered
despite
his
mantle
is
strange
said
he
and
passing
strange
that
they
should
all
lie
dead
not
a
living
man
among
them
how
think
you
roger
i
think
lord
others
have
been
here
afore
us
see
you
this
knight
now
his
gorget
loosed
off
o
messire
said
a
faint
voice
hard
by
if
ye
have
any
pity
save
me
from
the
crone
for
the
love
of
christ
let
not
the
hag
slay
me
as
she
hath
so
many
save
me
starting
round
beltane
espied
a
pale
face
that
glared
up
at
him
from
a
thick
beside
the
way
a
youthful
face
albeit
haggard
and
drawn
fear
not
said
beltane
kneeling
beside
the
wounded
youth
thy
life
is
safe
from
us
but
what
mean
you
by
talk
of
hag
and
crone
ah
messire
ere
the
dawn
we
fell
upon
sir
benedict
of
bourne
a
seditious
lord
who
hath
long
withstood
duke
ivo
but
though
his
men
were
few
they
fought
hard
and
gained
the
ford
ahead
of
us
and
in
the
fight
i
with
many
others
as
ye
see
was
smitten
down
and
the
fight
rolled
on
and
left
us
here
in
the
dust
as
i
lay
striving
to
tend
my
hurt
and
hearkening
to
the
sighs
and
groans
of
the
stricken
i
heard
a
scream
and
looking
about
beheld
an
ancient
woman
busied
with
her
knife
slaying
slaying
and
robbing
the
dead
ah
behold
her
with
the
archer
yonder
and
verily
roger
stepped
forth
of
the
underwood
that
clothed
the
steep
dragging
a
thing
of
rags
and
tatters
a
wretched
creature
bent
and
wrinkled
that
mopped
and
mowed
with
toothless
chaps
and
clutched
a
misshapen
bundle
in
yellow
fingers
and
these
yellow
fingers
were
splotched
horribly
with
dark
stains
even
as
were
the
rags
that
covered
her
she
whined
and
whimpered
querulously
mouthing
inarticulate
plaints
and
prayers
as
roger
haled
her
along
with
cnut
and
walkyn
fierce
and
scowling
behind
having
brought
her
to
beltane
roger
loosed
her
and
wrenching
away
her
bundle
opened
it
and
lo
a
hoard
of
golden
of
rings
and
armlets
of
golden
spurs
and
the
which
he
incontinent
scattered
at
beltane
feet
whereon
the
gibbering
creature
screamed
in
cracked
and
ancient
voice
and
screeching
threw
herself
upon
the
gold
and
fell
to
scrabbling
among
the
dust
with
her
gnarled
and
bony
fingers
and
ever
as
she
raked
and
raked
she
screeched
harsh
and
high
a
hateful
noise
that
ended
of
a
sudden
in
a
wheezing
sob
and
sinking
down
she
lay
outstretched
and
silent
her
wrinkled
face
in
the
dust
and
a
shaft
transfixing
her
yellow
throat
so
swift
had
death
been
dealt
that
all
men
fell
back
a
pace
and
were
yet
staring
down
at
this
awful
dead
thing
when
forth
from
the
brush
an
archer
crawled
painfully
his
bow
yet
in
his
hand
and
so
lay
panting
loud
and
hoarse
ha
cried
cnut
is
lusty
siward
of
our
archers
how
now
siward
i
sped
cnut
groaned
siward
but
yon
hag
lieth
dead
so
am
i
content
i
watched
her
slay
john
that
was
my
comrade
you
mind
for
his
armlet
and
good
sir
hugh
she
stabbed
yonder
he
lieth
him
she
slew
for
spurs
and
chain
when
i
fell
i
dropped
my
bow
in
the
brush
yonder
i
have
been
two
hours
creeping
a
dozen
yards
to
reach
my
bow
but
i
got
it
at
last
aha
and
siward
feebly
pointing
to
the
ancient
dead
woman
strove
to
laugh
and
so
died
then
beltane
turned
and
coming
beside
the
wounded
youth
spake
him
tender
and
compassionate
young
sir
we
must
hence
but
first
can
i
do
aught
forthee
o
messire
an
i
might
come
to
the
river
water
saying
no
word
beltane
stooped
and
lifting
the
young
knight
very
carefully
bore
him
down
toward
the
ford
messire
quoth
the
young
knight
stifling
his
groans
art
very
strong
and
wondrous
gentle
withal
presently
beltane
brought
him
beside
the
river
and
while
the
youth
drank
laid
bare
an
ugly
wound
above
the
knee
and
bathed
it
with
his
hand
and
thereafter
tearing
a
strip
from
his
ragged
cloak
he
bound
it
tight
above
the
hurt
even
as
he
had
seen
sir
fidelis
do
and
thus
stayed
the
bleeding
now
while
this
was
the
young
knight
must
needs
talk
ho
cried
he
was
a
good
fight
messire
and
he
who
gave
me
this
was
none
other
than
benedict
of
bourne
himself
whom
our
good
duke
doth
fondly
imagine
pent
up
within
thrasfordham
o
indeed
was
sir
benedict
i
saw
his
plain
ere
he
closed
his
vizor
and
he
fought
moreover
beside
him
i
recognised
the
leaping
dog
blazoned
on
the
shield
of
hacon
of
trant
oho
this
shall
be
wondrous
news
for
duke
ivo
methinks
but
faith
is
wonder
how
he
escaped
sir
rollo
and
as
for
the
outlaw
beltane
we
saw
nought
of
him
sir
pertolepe
vows
he
was
not
of
this
company
mayhap
sir
rollo
hath
him
so
i
pray
so
peradventure
i
shall
see
him
hang
yet
my
grateful
thanks
messire
for
thy
tender
care
of
me
at
home
i
have
a
mother
that
watcheth
and
prayeth
for
me
prithee
tell
me
thy
name
that
she
may
remember
it
in
her
prayers
i
am
called
beltane
the
outlaw
sir
knight
and
i
charge
thee
to
heed
that
thy
bandage
slip
not
lest
the
bleeding
start
afresh
fare
thee
well
so
saying
beltane
turned
and
went
on
across
the
ford
what
time
the
young
knight
propped
upon
weak
elbow
stared
after
him
wide
of
eye
and
mouth
forthwith
beltane
setting
horn
to
lip
sounded
the
rally
and
very
soon
the
three
hundred
crossed
the
ford
and
swung
off
to
the
left
into
the
green
thus
heartened
and
refreshed
by
food
and
rest
they
pressed
on
amain
southward
through
the
forest
with
eyes
and
ears
alert
and
on
the
strain
what
time
grim
sir
benedict
riding
with
his
rearguard
peered
through
the
dust
of
battle
but
saw
only
the
threatening
column
of
the
foe
upon
the
forest
road
behind
rank
upon
rank
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
the
dense
green
of
the
adjacent
woods
on
either
flank
whence
unseen
arrows
whizzed
ever
and
anon
to
glance
from
his
heavy
armour
ha
benedict
quoth
sir
brian
they
do
know
thee
methinks
thy
plain
armour
is
the
third
shaft
hath
struck
thee
in
as
many
minutes
so
needs
must
i
stifle
and
sweat
within
closed
casque
sir
benedict
groaned
upon
his
right
hand
sir
brian
rode
and
upon
his
left
his
chiefest
esquire
and
oft
needs
must
they
wheel
their
chargers
to
front
the
thunderous
onset
of
red
pertolepe
fierce
van
at
the
which
times
sir
benedict
laughed
and
gibed
through
his
vizor
as
he
thrust
and
smote
parrying
sword
and
right
skilfully
nevertheless
since
shield
he
bare
none
time
and
again
they
beat
back
their
assailants
thus
until
spent
and
short
of
wind
they
gave
place
to
three
fresh
knights
by
our
lady
of
hartismere
panted
sir
brian
but
thy
left
arm
serves
thee
well
benedict
is
fair
brian
is
fair
god
be
thanked
sighed
sir
benedict
eyeing
his
reeking
blade
though
i
missed
my
thrust
yon
gentle
knight
gorget
yet
shore
clean
through
his
helm
my
lord
quoth
young
walter
the
esquire
why
truly
is
a
good
blade
this
of
mine
said
sir
benedict
and
sighed
again
art
doleful
benedict
questioned
sir
brian
is
not
like
thee
when
steel
is
ringing
man
in
very
sooth
brian
i
hanker
for
knowledge
of
our
beltane
ha
walter
he
cried
suddenly
lower
thy
vizor
boy
down
with
it
i
say
nay
dear
my
lord
fain
would
i
breathe
the
sweet
cool
air
but
a
moment
and
the
young
esquire
rose
up
stiffly
in
his
stirrups
threw
up
gauntleted
hands
and
swaying
from
the
high
saddle
pitched
down
crashing
into
the
dust
alas
there
endeth
my
poor
walter
sighed
sir
benedict
aye
a
shaft
between
the
eyes
poor
lad
a
curse
on
these
unseen
archers
quoth
sir
brian
beckoning
a
pikeman
to
lead
forward
the
riderless
horse
ha
look
yonder
benedict
we
are
beset
in
flank
and
by
dismounted
knights
from
the
underwood
see
as
i
live
is
the
nuns
they
make
for
nothing
saying
sir
benedict
spurred
forward
beside
his
company
in
the
midst
of
the
column
was
dire
tumult
and
shouting
where
from
the
dense
woods
upon
their
left
a
body
of
knights
sheathed
in
steel
from
head
to
foot
were
cutting
their
way
toward
the
lady
abbess
who
conspicuous
in
her
white
habit
was
soothing
her
frightened
palfrey
all
about
her
a
shouting
reeling
press
of
sir
benedict
footmen
were
giving
back
and
back
before
the
swing
of
ponderous
axe
and
mace
and
sword
were
smitten
down
and
trampled
those
resistless
ranks
ha
the
abbess
they
cried
yield
us
the
lady
abbess
into
this
close
and
desperate
affray
sir
benedict
spurred
striving
with
voice
and
hand
to
his
broken
ranks
hewing
him
a
path
by
dint
of
sword
until
he
had
won
beside
the
abbess
yolande
he
shouted
above
the
din
keep
thou
beside
me
close
close
yolande
stoop
ah
stoop
thy
head
that
i
may
cover
thee
the
debate
waxeth
a
little
sharp
hereabouts
even
as
he
spake
he
reeled
the
blow
of
a
heavy
mace
steadied
himself
cut
down
his
smiter
and
thrust
and
smote
amain
until
the
grim
ranks
gave
back
before
the
sweep
of
that
long
sword
see
yolande
he
panted
see
yonder
where
my
good
hacon
spurs
in
to
our
relief
ha
mighty
lance
ah
benedict
cried
the
abbess
but
calm
of
eye
of
what
avail
is
me
they
seek
though
wherefore
i
know
not
so
dear
benedict
let
me
go
indeed
indeed
is
best
so
shall
these
fair
lives
be
saved
ah
sweet
jesu
is
horrible
see
o
see
how
fast
they
fall
and
die
about
us
i
must
go
i
will
go
my
lord
let
me
pass
loose
my
bridle
a
hunting
horn
fiercely
winded
among
the
woods
hard
by
a
confused
roar
of
harsh
voices
and
forth
of
the
green
four
terrible
figures
sprang
two
that
smote
with
axes
and
two
that
plied
ponderous
broadswords
and
behind
these
men
were
others
lean
and
the
very
woods
seemed
alive
with
them
and
from
these
fierce
ranks
a
mighty
shout
rent
the
air
arise
arise
ha
beltane
pentavalon
then
did
sir
benedict
laughing
loud
and
joyous
haste
to
his
swaying
ranks
the
bloody
gap
in
his
column
closed
up
and
sir
pertolepe
knights
hemmed
in
thus
smote
and
were
smitten
and
but
scant
few
were
they
that
won
them
free
and
presently
through
that
red
confusion
brake
beltane
with
roger
and
ulf
and
walkyn
at
his
heels
and
sword
in
hand
he
sprang
and
caught
the
abbess
in
a
close
embrace
mother
he
cried
dear
dear
son
of
mine
and
thou
art
safe
thanks
be
to
god
who
hath
heard
the
passion
of
thy
mother
prayers
now
sir
benedict
turned
and
wheeling
his
horse
left
them
together
and
so
beheld
sir
hacon
near
by
who
standing
high
in
his
stirrups
pointed
to
their
rear
benedict
he
panted
ha
look
brian
is
ho
a
rescue
a
rescue
to
sir
brian
of
hartismere
so
shouting
he
drave
back
into
the
confusion
of
the
staggering
with
sir
benedict
spurring
behind
but
as
sir
benedict
rode
pushing
past
the
files
of
his
halted
company
he
felt
hands
that
gripped
either
stirrup
and
glancing
down
beheld
ulf
the
strong
on
his
one
flank
and
grim
walkyn
upon
the
other
so
came
they
where
the
road
broadened
out
and
where
the
battle
raged
swaying
and
surging
above
the
form
of
sir
brian
prostrate
in
the
dust
where
horsemen
and
footmen
strove
together
in
desperate
grapple
where
knightly
shields
aflare
with
proud
devices
rang
the
blows
of
beltane
lusty
foresters
and
sir
benedict
veteran
pikemen
then
of
a
sudden
walkyn
shouted
fierce
and
loud
and
sprang
forward
with
mighty
axe
whirled
aloft
ha
pertolepe
turn
he
roared
ho
bloody
pertolepe
turn
thou
dog
is
i
is
waldron
of
brand
so
cried
he
and
plunging
into
the
thick
of
the
affray
smote
aside
all
such
as
barred
his
way
until
he
fronted
sir
pertolepe
who
astride
a
powerful
mailed
charger
wielded
a
bloody
mace
and
who
hearing
that
hoarse
cry
turned
and
met
the
shearing
axe
with
blazoned
shield
and
behold
the
gorgeous
shield
was
split
in
twain
but
even
so
he
smote
in
turn
and
mighty
walkyn
was
beaten
to
his
knee
forth
sprang
ulf
swift
and
eager
but
walkyn
bounding
up
shouldered
him
aside
his
axe
whirled
and
fell
once
and
sir
pertolepe
mace
was
dashed
from
his
loosened
hold
whirled
and
fell
again
and
sir
pertolepe
great
casque
was
beaten
from
his
head
and
all
men
might
see
the
ghastly
jagged
cross
that
scarred
his
brow
beneath
his
fiery
hair
whirled
again
but
ere
it
could
fall
knights
and
esquires
mounted
and
afoot
had
burst
walkyn
and
their
reeling
lord
and
walkyn
was
dashed
aside
shouting
cursing
foaming
with
rage
what
time
sir
pertolepe
was
borne
out
of
the
fight
but
the
was
saved
and
with
a
hedge
of
bristling
pikes
behind
sir
benedict
company
marched
on
along
the
and
breathed
again
the
while
their
pursuers
staggered
in
their
onset
paused
to
ere
they
thundered
down
upon
that
devoted
once
more
but
sir
benedict
was
there
and
cheery
still
despite
fatigue
and
sir
hacon
was
there
his
wonted
gloom
forgotten
quite
and
beltane
was
there
equipped
with
shield
and
vizored
and
astride
a
noble
horse
and
there
too
was
roger
grim
and
silent
and
fierce
ulf
and
walkyn
in
black
and
evil
temper
quoth
he
ha
is
ever
so
his
life
within
my
very
grasp
yet
doth
he
escape
me
but
one
more
blow
and
the
red
pertolepe
had
been
in
hell
yet
forsooth
didst
save
our
comrade
said
ulf
aye
and
what
o
that
was
pertolepe
foul
life
i
sought
and
there
quoth
beltane
there
spake
vengeance
and
vengeance
is
ever
a
foul
thing
and
very
selfish
now
hereupon
walkyn
scowl
deepened
and
falling
further
to
the
rear
he
spake
no
more
beltane
dear
my
lad
said
sir
benedict
as
they
rode
together
hast
told
me
nought
of
thy
doings
last
night
what
of
sir
rollo
nay
benedict

me
not
yet
only
rest
ye
assured
sir
rollo
shall
not
trouble
us
this
side
belsaye
but
pray
how
doth
our
brave
sir
brian
well
enough
beltane
he
lieth
in
a
litter
being
tended
by
thy
noble
lady
mother
a
small
the
gorget

healed
ha
they
charge
us
again
stand
firm
pikes
so
shouting
sir
benedict
wheeled
his
horse
and
beltane
with
him
and
once
again
the
road
echoed
to
the
din
of
battle
thus
all
day
long
they
fought
their
way
south
along
the
as
time
and
again
sir
pertolepe
heavy
chivalry
thundered
down
upon
them
to
check
and
break
before
that
hedge
of
deadly
pikes
so
marched
this
valiant
parched
with
thirst
choked
with
dust
grim
with
blood
and
wounds
until
as
the
sun
sank
westwards
the
woods
thinned
away
and
they
beheld
at
last
and
joyful
the
walls
and
towers
of
fair
belsaye
town
now
just
beyond
the
edge
of
the
woods
sir
benedict
halted
his
shrunken
column
his
dusty
pikemen
drawn
up
across
the
narrow
road
with
archers
behind
supported
by
his
cavalry
to
hold
sir
pertolepe
powers
in
check
amid
the
woods
what
time
the
nuns
with
the
spent
and
wounded
hasted
on
towards
the
city
hereupon
beltane
raised
his
vizor
and
setting
horn
to
lip
sounded
the
rally
and
lo
from
the
city
a
glad
and
mighty
shout
went
up
the
while
above
the
square
and
frowning
keep
a
great
standard
arose
and
flapping
out
upon
the
soft
air
discovered
a
red
lion
on
a
white
field
aha
beltane
quoth
sir
benedict
yon
is
a
sight
behold
thy
father
lion
banner
that
hath
not
felt
the
breeze
this
many
a
year
aye
lords
growled
walkyn
and
yonder
cometh
yet
another
lion
a
black
lion
on
red
and
he
pointed
where
far
to
their
left
a
red
standard
flaunted
above
the
distant
glitter
of
a

hast
good
eyes
walkyn
said
sir
benedict
peering
his
hand
toward
the
advancing
host
aye
verily
is
ivo
himself
sir
pertolepe
must
have
warned
him
of
our
coming
so
are
we
like
to
be
crushed
hammer
and
anvil
quoth
sir
hacon
tightening
the
lacing
of
his
battered
casque
so
will
i
give
thee
charge
of
our
knights
and
what
is
left
of
them
alas
to
meet
black
ivo
banner
my
doleful
hacon
spake
sir
benedict
nay
benedict
said
sir
hacon
my
dole
is
but
caution
so
saying
he
closed
his
vizor
and
rode
away
to
muster
his
chivalry
to
meet
their
new
assailants
the
while
sir
benedict
fell
to
his
scanty
ranks
of
pikemen
and
archers
meantime
beltane
sitting
his
weary
charger
glanced
from
sir
pertolepe
deep
array
of
knights
and
that
thronged
and
jostled
each
other
in
the
narrow
to
the
distant
flash
and
glitter
of
duke
mighty
and
from
these
again
to
the
walls
of
belsaye
and
as
he
looked
thither
he
saw
the
great
drawbridge
fall
the
portcullis
raised
and
the
gates
flung
wide
to
admit
the
fugitives
even
at
that
distance
he
thought
to
recognise
the
abbess
who
paused
to
turn
and
gaze
towards
him
as
last
of
all
she
rode
to
safety
into
the
city
then
my
beltane
sighed
and
closing
his
vizor
turned
to
find
ulf
beside
him
with
roger
and
walkyn
who
stood
to
watch
the
while
sir
benedict
rode
to
and
fro
ordering
his
company
for
their
perilous
retreat
across
the
plain
swift
and
silent
his
veterans
fell
to
their
appointed
ranks
his
trumpets
blew
and
they
began
to
fall
back
on
belsaye
town
grimly
silent
they
marched
and
ever
beltane
gazed
where
near
and
ever
more
near
flashed
and
flickered
duke
and
now
from
the
sir
pertolepe
company
marched
and
forming
in
the
open
spurred
down
upon
them
stand
firm
pikes
roared
cnut
aim
low
archers
squealed
small
prat
and
forthwith
the
battle
joined
the
weary
rocked
and
swayed
beneath
the
onset
but
prat
and
his
archers
shot
amain
arrows
whistled
while
pike
and
gisarm
thrust
and
smote
as
encompassed
now
on
three
sides
they
fell
back
and
back
towards
the
yawning
gates
of
belsaye
and
ever
as
he
fought
beltane
by
times
turned
to
watch
where
duke
ivo
threatening
galloped
a
long
line
of
gleaming
shields
and
levelled
lances
gay
with
the
glitter
of
pennon
and
banderol
back
and
back
the
staggered
hewing
and
smiting
twice
beltane
reeled
unseen
blows
and
with
eyes
beheld
roger
and
ulf
who
fought
at
either
stirrup
heard
of
a
sudden
shrieks
and
cries
and
the
thunder
of
galloping
hooves
was
aware
of
the
flash
of
bright
armour
to
his
left
rank
upon
rank
where
charged
duke
before
whose
furious
onset
sir
benedict
weary
pikemen
were
hurled
back
their
centre
swayed
broke
and
immediately
all
was
dire
uproar
and
confusion
ah
beltane
these
be
fresh
men
on
fresh
horses
cried
sir
benedict
but
hey
body
o
me
all
not
lost
yet
malediction
no
and
is
scarce
half
a
mile
to
the
gates
ha
yonder
rides
lusty
hacon
to
stay
their
rush
in
upon
them
beltane
ho
pentavalon
shouting
thus
sir
benedict
plunged
headlong
into
the
raging
fury
of
the
battle
but
as
beltane
spurred
in
after
him
his
weary
charger
smitten
by
an
arrow
reared
up
screaming
yet
ere
he
fell
beltane
kicking
free
of
the
stirrups
rolled
clear
a
mighty
hand
plucked
him
to
his
feet
and
ulf
roaring
in
his
ear
pointed
with
his
dripping
axe
and
looking
whither
he
pointed
beltane
beheld
sir
benedict
borne
down
beneath
a
press
of
knights
but
as
he
lay
pinned
beneath
his
squealing
charger
beltane
leapt
and
bestrode
him
sword
in
hand
roger
he
shouted
ulf
walkyn
to
me
all
about
him
was
a
swaying
trample
of
horses
and
men
an
iron
ring
that
hemmed
him
in
blows
dinted
his
long
shield
they
rang
upon
his
helmet
they
battered
his
triple
mail
they
split
his
shield
in
sunder
and
this
hail
of
blows
beltane
staggered
thrice
he
was
smitten
to
his
knees
and
thrice
he
arose
and
ever
his
long
blade
whirled
and
darted
yield
thee
sir
knight
yield
thee
was
the
cry
ho
roger
he
shouted
hoarsely
ulf
walkyn
to
me
an
axe
bit
through
his
great
helm
a
sword
bent
against
his
stout
mail
a
knight
spurred
in
upon
him
blade
levelled
to
thrust
again
but
beltane
deadly
point
darted
upward
and
the
snorting
charger
plunged
away
riderless
but
now
as
he
fought
on
with
failing
arm
came
a
joyous
roar
on
his
right
where
ulf
smote
direly
with
bloody
axe
upon
his
left
hand
a
flickered
where
roger
fought
silent
and
grim
beyond
him
again
walkyn
long
arms
rose
and
fell
as
he
whirled
his
axe
and
hard
by
tall
orson
plied
goring
pike
so
fought
these
mighty
four
until
the
press
thinned
out
and
they
had
cleared
them
a
space
amid
the
battle
the
while
beltane
leaned
him
spent
and
panting
upon
his
reeking
sword
now
as
he
stood
thus
from
a
tangle
of
the
fallen
near
by
a
bent
and
battered
helm
was
lifted
and
sir
benedict
spake
faint
and
short
of
breath
was
nobly
done
sweet
lad
is
enough
methinks
there
be
few
of
us
left
i
fear
me
so
get
thee
hence
with
such
as

hence
beltane
for
thy
sweet

nay

not
old
benedict
i
did
my
best
and
is
a
fitting
couch
this
farewell
to
thee
my
beltane
so
saying
sir
benedict
sank
weakly
to
an
elbow
and
from
elbow
upon
his
face
and
lay
there
very
still
and
mute
master
master
cried
roger
we
shall
win

belsaye

giles
hath
them
with
his
pikes
and
archers
and
ha
yonder
good
eric
o
the
noose
chargeth
them
home
but
beltane
leaned
him
upon
his
sword
very
spent
and
sick
and
stared
ever
upon
sir
benedict
motionless
form
his
harness
bent
and
hacked
his
proud
helm
prone
in
the
trampled
ling
slowly
and
with
fumbling
hands
beltane
sheathed
his
sword
and
stooping
raised
sir
benedict
upon
his
shoulder
and
strove
to
bear
him
out
of
the
fight
but
twice
he
staggered
in
his
going
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
roger
ready
arm
master
quoth
he
master
let
me
aid
thee
with
him
but
nothing
saying
beltane
stumbled
on
until
they
came
where
stood
ulf
holding
a
riderless
horse
on
the
which
he
made
shift
to
mount
with
roger
aid
thereafter
ulf
lifted
sir
benedict
to
his
hold
and
pray
you
said
beltane
slow
and
blurred
of
speech
pray
you
what
of
noble
sir
hacon
alack

growled
ulf
yonder
is
he
where
they
lie
so
thick
and
slain
methinks
yet
will
i
bring
him
off
aye
lord
cried
tall
orson
great
tears
furrowing
the
grime
of
his
cheeks
and
little
prat
do
be
killed
and
lusty
cnut
do
be
killed
him
and
my
good
comrade
jenkyn
do
lie
smitten
to
death
o
there
do
be
none
of
us
left
methinks
lord
so
faint
and
with
sir
benedict
limp
across
his
saddle
bow
beltane
rode
from
that
place
of
death
beside
him
went
roger
stumbling
and
weary
and
behind
them
strode
mighty
ulf
with
sir
hacon
upon
his
shoulder
in
a
while
as
they
went
thus
beltane
glancing
back
at
the
fight
beheld
stout
eric
with
the
men
of
belsaye
well
mounted
and
equipped
at
fierce
grapple
with
duke
ivo
what
time
giles
and
his
archers
supported
by
lusty
pikemen
plied
sir
pertolepe
weary
forces
with
whizzing
shafts
drawing
and
loosing
marvellous
fast
so
came
they
at
last
unto
the
gates
of
belsaye
town
that
were
already
with
many
wounded
and
divers
others
of
sir
benedict
company
that
had
won
out
of
the
affray
now
upon
the
drawbridge
beltane
paused
and
gave
sir
benedict
and
brave
hacon
into
kindly
eager
hands
then
wheeling
with
ulf
and
roger
beside
him
rode
back
toward
the
battle
and
ever
as
they
went
came
scattered
groups
of
sir
benedict
stout
staggering
with
weariness
and
limping
with
wounds
the
while
upon
the
plain
beyond
eric
with
his
and
walkyn
with
the
survivors
of
the
foresters
and
giles
with
his
archers
and
pikemen
holding
the
foe
in
play
fell
back
upon
the
town
compact
and
orderly
thus
they
in
turn
began
to
cross
the
drawbridge
archers
and
pikemen
and
last
of
all
the
until
only
eric
o
the
noose
and
a
handful
of
his
horsemen
with
beltane
roger
and
ulf
remained
beyond
the
drawbridge
whereon
the
enemy
came
on
amain
and
their
furious
onset
brave
eric
was
unhorsed
then
beltane
drew
sword
and
with
roger
and
ulf
running
at
either
stirrup
spurred
in
to
the
rescue
a
shock
of
steel
a
whirl
and
flurry
of
blows
a
shout
of
triumph
and
reeling
in
his
saddle
dazed
and
sick
beltane
found
himself
alone
fronting
a
bristling
line
of
feutred
lances
he
heard
roger
shout
to
him
wild
and
fearful
heard
walkyn
roar
at
him
felt
a
sudden
shock
and
was
down
unhelmed
and
pinned
beneath
his
stricken
charger
half
he
lay
thus
seeing
dimly
the
line
of
while
on
his
failing
senses
a
fierce
cry
smote
is
beltane
the
outlaw
slay
him
slay
him
but
now
of
a
sudden
and
as
one
that
dreamed
he
beheld
a
tender
face
above
him
with
eyes
and
lips
that
bent
to
kiss
his
brow
felt
soft
arms
about
him
tender
arms
that
drew
his
weary
head
upon
a
gentle
bosom
to
hide
and
pillow
it
there
felt
that
enfolding
embrace
tighten
and
tighten
in
sudden
shuddering
spasm
as
sighing
the
lady
abbess
arms
fell
away
and
her
proud
head
sank
beside
his
in
the
dust
and
now
was
a
rush
and
roar
of
fierce
voices
as
over
them
sprang
roger
and
giles
with
ulf
and
eric
and
amid
the
eddying
dust
axe
and
sword
swung
and
smote
while
came
hands
strong
yet
tender
that
bare
beltane
into
the
city
now
beyond
the
gate
of
the
city
was
a
well
and
beside
the
well
they
laid
beltane
and
bathed
him
with
the
sweet
cool
water
until
at
length
the
mist
vanished
from
his
sight
and
thus
he
beheld
the
white
abbess
who
lay
upon
a
pile
of
cloaks
hard
by
and
beholding
the
deadly
pallor
of
lip
and
cheek
the
awful
stains
that
spotted
her
white
robe
and
the
fading
light
in
those
eyes
beltane
cried
aloud
a
great
and
bitter
cry
and
fell
before
her
on
his
knees
mother
he
groaned
o
my
mother
dear
my
beltane
she
whispered
faintly
striving
to
kiss
his
hand
death
is
none
so
painful
so
grieve
not
thine
heart
for
me
sweet
son
and
how
may
a
mother
die
better
than
for
her
own
beloved
son
beltane
if
god
o
if
god
in
his
infinite
mercy
shall
think
me
worthy
to
be
one
of
his
holy
angels
then
will
i
be
ever
near
thee
when
thy
way
proveth
dark
to
comfort
thee
to
aid
thee
o
dear
my
son
i
sought
thee
so
long
so
long
is
a
little
hard
to
leave
thee
so
soon
but
god
will
fare
thee
well
i
die
aye
this
is
death
methinks
beltane
tell
thy
father
that
i
o
dear
my
my
beltane
so
died
the
gracious
lady
abbess
that
had
been
the
proud
yolande
duchess
of
pentavalon
wept
and
bemoaned
by
full
many
who
had
known
her
tender
care
and
in
due
season
she
was
laid
to
rest
within
the
fair
minster
of
belsaye
and
thereafter
beltane
took
to
his
bed
and
abode
there
many
days
because
of
his
wounds
and
by
reason
of
his
so
great
sorrow
and
but
that
night
through
the
dark
hours
was
strange
stir
and
hum
beyond
the
walls
of
belsaye
and
when
the
dawn
broke
many
a
stout
heart
quailed
and
many
a
cheek
blanched
to
see
a
great
camp
whose
fortified
lines
encompassed
the
city
on
all
sides
where
lay
ivo
the
black
duke
to
besiege
them
chapter
lxiii
telleth
somewhat
of
the
woes
of
giles
o
the
bow
six
days
and
nights
my
beltane
kept
his
bed
seeing
and
speaking
to
no
man
and
it
is
like
he
would
have
died
but
for
the
fostering
care
of
the
good
friar
martin
who
came
and
went
softly
about
him
who
watched
and
tended
and
prayed
over
him
long
and
silently
but
who
perceiving
his
spake
him
not
at
all
day
in
and
day
out
beltane
lay
there
heedless
of
all
but
his
great
sorrow
sleeping
little
and
eating
less
his
face
hid
in
his
pillow
or
turned
to
the
wall
and
in
all
this
time
he
uttered
no
word
nor
shed
a
single
tear
his
wounds
healed
apace
but
his
soul
had
taken
a
deeper
hurt
and
day
and
night
he
sorrowed
fiercely
for
his
noble
mother
wherefore
he
lay
thus
heeding
nought
but
his
great
grief
but
upon
the
seventh
night
he
dreamed
she
stood
beside
his
couch
tall
and
fair
and
gracious
and
looked
down
on
him
the
alight
within
her
sweet
sad
eyes
now
within
her
hand
she
bare
his
sword
and
showed
him
the
legend
graven
upon
the
bright
steel
resurgam
and
therewith
she
smiled
wondrous
tender
and
put
the
great
weapon
into
his
grasp
then
stooped
and
kissed
him
and
pointing
upward
with
her
finger
was
gone
and
now
within
his
sleep
his
anguished
heart
found
solacement
in
slow
and
burning
tears
and
sleeping
yet
he
wept
full
bitterly
insomuch
that
sobbing
he
awoke
and
lo
beneath
his
right
hand
was
the
touch
of
cold
steel
and
his
fingers
clenched
tight
upon
the
hilt
of
his
great
sword
then
my
beltane
arose
forthwith
and
finding
his
clothes
near
by
clad
himself
and
did
on
his
mail
and
went
forth
of
his
narrow
chamber
thus
came
he
where
friar
martin
lay
in
his
slumber
and
waking
him
not
he
passed
out
into
the
dawn
and
in
the
dawn
was
a
gentle
wind
very
cool
and
grateful
that
touched
his
burning
brow
and
eyes
like
a
caress
now
looking
up
to
heaven
where
stars
were
paling
to
the
dawn
beltane
raised
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
o
blessed
mother
he
whispered
god
hath
surely
found
thee
worthy
to
be
one
of
his
holy
angels
so
hast
thou
stooped
from
heaven
to
teach
to
me
my
duty
thus
now
will
i
set
by
my
idle
grieving
for
thee
sweet
saint
and
strive
to
live
thy
worthy
son
o
dear
my
mother
who
being
dead
yet
liveth
then
beltane
sheathed
his
sword
and
went
softly
up
the
narrow
stair
that
led
to
the
battlements
it
was
a
bleak
dawn
full
of
a
thick
mist
beyond
the
walls
but
within
this
mist
to
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
was
a
faint
stir
while
ever
and
anon
rose
the
distant
cry
of
some
sentinel
within
duke
ivo
sleeping
camp
a
mighty
camp
whose
unseen
powers
held
the
fair
city
in
deadly
grip
in
belsaye
nothing
stirred
and
none
waked
at
this
dead
hour
save
where
high
on
the
bartizan
above
the
square
and
mighty
keep
the
watchman
paced
to
and
fro
while
here
and
there
from
curtain
wall
and
massy
tower
and
bascinet
gleamed
slow
and
light
of
foot
beltane
climbed
the
narrow
stair
that
led
up
to
one
of
the
two
square
towers
that
flanked
the
main
gate
but
being
come
thither
he
paused
to
behold
giles
who
chancing
to
be
captain
of
the
watch
sat
upon
a
pile
of
great
stones
beside
a
powerful
mangonel
or
catapult
and
stared
him
dolefully
upon
the
lightening
east
full
oft
sighed
he
and
therewith
shook
despondent
head
and
even
thus
fell
he
to
soft
and
doleful
singing
groaning
to
himself
each
verse
on
this
wise
she
will
not
heed
her

nigh
the

that
i
alack
i
have
ever
been
a

light
fellow
in
matters
of
love
forget
not
i
was
bred
a
monk
noble
brother
thus
brother
a
moping
owl
i
a
very
curst
fellow
gloomy
and
silent
as
the
grave
saving
my
breath
for
sighs
and
groans
and
curses
fell
wherefore
i
have
builded
me
a
above
the
wall
and
do
curse
our
foes
as
only
a
churchman
may
brother
nay
how
mean
you
giles
questioned
beltane
staring
follow
me
lord
and
i
will
show
thee
so
saying
giles
led
the
way
down
to
the
battlement
above
the
great
gates
where
was
a
thing
like
unto
a
rough
pulpit
builded
of
massy
timbers
very
stout
and
strong
and
in
these
timbers
stood
many
arrows
and
bolts
here
lord
quoth
giles
behold
my
wherefrom
it
is
my
wont
and
custom
to
curse
our
foes
thrice
daily
the
which
is
a
right
good
strategy
brother
in
that
my
amorous
anguish
findeth
easement
and
i
do
draw
the
enemy
shafts
for
there
is
no
man
that
heareth
my
contumacious
dictums
but
he
forthwith
falleth
into
rageful
fury
and
an
angry
fellow
shooteth
ever
wide
o
the
mark
brother
thus
thrice
daily
do
we
gather
a
full
sheaf
of
their
shafts
whereby
we
shall
not
lack
for
arrows
an
they
besiege
us
till
gabriel
trump
heigho
thus
do
i
live
by
curses
for
an
i
could
not
curse
then
would
my
surcharged
heart
assuredly
in
sunder
burst
aye
me
now
whiles
they
sat
thus
in
talk
up
rose
the
sun
before
whose
joyous
beams
the
stealthy
mists
slunk
away
little
by
little
until
beltane
beheld
duke
ivo
mighty
camp
long
lines
of
tents
gay
with
fluttering
pennon
and
gonfalon
of
huts
and
booths
set
well
out
of
bowshot
behind
the
works
of
contravallation
stout
palisades
and
barriers
with
earthworks
very
goodly
and
strong
and
presently
from
among
these
booths
and
tents
was
the
gleam
and
glitter
of
armour
what
time
from
the
waking
host
a
hum
and
stir
arose
with
blare
and
fanfare
of
trumpet
to
usher
in
the
day
and
in
a
while
from
the
midst
of
the
camp
came
the
faint
ring
and
tap
of
many
hammers
now
as
the
mists
cleared
looking
thitherward
beltane
stared
to
behold
wooden
towers
in
course
of
building
with
the
grim
shapes
of
many
powerful
whose
mighty
and
massy
filled
him
with
great
awe
and
wonderment
ha
quoth
giles
they
work
apace
yonder
and
by
saint
giles
they
lack
not
for
engines
verily
black
ivo
is
a
master
of
siege
tactics
but
so
is
giles
brother
see
where
he
setteth
up
his
mangonels
trebuchets
perriers
and
balistae
with
bossons
or
rams
towers
and
cats
in
the
use
of
the
which
he
is
right
cunning
but
so
also
is
giles
brother
and
verily
though
your
mangonels
and
trebuchets
are
well
enough
yet
for
defence
the
balista
is
weapon
more
apt
methinks
as
being
more
accurate
in
the
shooting
and
therefore
more
deadly
how
think
you
lord
indeed
giles
being
a
forester
i
could
scarce
tell
you
one
from
another
ha
then
you
know
nought
of
their
nature
and
use
lord
nought
giles
have
i
seen
their
like
until
now
say
ye
so
brother
cried
giles
full
eager
his
brown
eyes
say
ye
so
in
very
truth
then
an
it
be
so
thy
wish
i
might
instruct
thee
vastly
for
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
shall
discourse
you
more
fluent
and
learned
upon
engines
and
various
tormenta
than
i
so
an
it
be
thy
wish
lord
it
is
my
wish
say
on
giles
why
then
firstly
lord
firstly
we
have
the
great
mangon
or
mangonel
that
some
do
also
term
the
which
worketh
by
torsion
and
shall
heave
you
great
stones
of
the
bigness
of
a
man
fully
two
hundred
yards
an
it
be
dry
weather
next
is
the
trebuchet
like
to
the
mangon
save
that
it
swingeth
by
counterpoise
next
cometh
the
balista
or
springald
that
worketh
by
tension
a
pretty
weapon
and
shall
shoot
you
dart
or
javelin
so
strong
as
shall
transpierce
you
six
lusty
fellows
at
a
time
hauberk
and
shield
like
so
many
fowl
upon
a
spit
very
sweet
to
behold
brother
then
have
we
the
bore
or
cat
that
some
again
do
name
or
mouse
for
that
it
gnaweth
through
thick
walls
and
some
do
call
this
hog
sow
or
brother
and
some
again
and
this
cat
is
a
massy
pole
that
beareth
a
great
and
sharp
steel
point
the
which
being
mounted
within
a
swingeth
merrily
to
and
fro
much
like
to
a
ram
brother
and
shall
blithely
pick
you
a
hole
through
stone
and
mortar
very
pleasing
to
behold
then
we
have
the
ram
that
battereth
next
we
have
the
tower
or
beffroi
that
goeth
on
wheels
yonder
you
shall
see
them
and
these
towers
moving
forward
against
your
city
shall
the
walls
and
from
them
archers
and
may
shoot
into
your
town
what
time
their
comrades
fill
up
and
dam
your
moat
until
the
tower
may
come
close
unto
your
walls
and
these
towers
being
come
against
the
wall
do
let
fall
drawbridges
over
which
the
besiegers
may
rush
amain
and
carry
your
walls
by
assault
lastly
there
be
mantlets
stakes
wattled
together
and
covered
with
by
the
which
means
the
besiegers
make
their
first
approaches
then
might
i
descant
at
goodly
length
upon
the
mine
and
furnace
with
divers
and
sundry
other
stratagems
devices
engines
and
tormenta
but
methinks
this
shall
mayhap
suffice
thee
for
the
nonce
aye
verily
suffice
said
beltane
rising
truly
war
is
even
more
terrible
than
i
had
thought
why
lord
is
an
art
a
notable
art
and
ha
this
doth
mind
me
of
my
heart
heigho
and
of
all
terrible
things
of
all
the
woes
and
ills
may
know
is
love
o
me
alack
and
woe
when
doth
thy
watch
end
giles
it
ended
an
hour
agone
but
to
what
end
being
a
lover
i
sleep
little
and
pine
much
and
this
is
a
fair
good
place
and
solitary
so
will
i
pine
awhile
and
likewise
mope
and
languish
alack
so
presently
as
beltane
descended
the
stair
he
heard
the
archer
break
forth
again
in
doleful
song
across
the
wide
went
beltane
with
brow
and
head
until
he
came
to
one
of
the
many
doors
of
the
great
minster
there
paused
he
to
remove
bascinet
and
and
thus
bareheaded
entered
the
cathedral
echoing
dimness
the
sun
made
a
glory
of
the
great
east
window
and
with
his
eyes
uplifted
to
this
glory
beltane
crossed
dim
aisle
and
whispering
transept
but
as
he
mounted
the
broad
steps
of
the
sanctuary
he
paused
with
breath
in
check
for
he
heard
a
sound
a
soft
sound
like
the
flutter
of
wings
or
the
rustle
of
silken
draperies
now
as
he
stood
thus
his
broad
shoulders
and
golden
hair
bathed
in
the
refulgence
of
the
great
window
it
seemed
to
him
that
from
somewhere
near
there
breathed
a
sigh
tremulous
and
very
soft
and
thereafter
was
the
quick
light
tread
of
feet
and
silence
a
while
stood
beltane
scarce
breathing
then
slow
and
reverent
he
approached
the
high
altar
and
ever
as
he
went
was
a
fragrance
that
grew
stronger
and
stronger
until
he
was
come
behind
the
high
altar
where
was
his
mother
grave
and
lo
upon
that
long
white
stone
lay
flowers
roses
and
lilies
whose
dewy
loveliness
filled
the
place
with
their
pure
and
fragrant
sweetness
so
looked
he
round
about
and
upon
these
flowers
with
grateful
wonder
and
sinking
to
his
knees
bowed
his
head
and
folded
his
hands
in
prayer
but
presently
as
he
knelt
thus
he
was
roused
by
the
clank
of
steel
and
a
shuffling
step
wherefore
he
arose
and
crossing
to
the
shadows
of
the
choir
sat
him
down
within
the
deeper
gloom
to
wait
until
his
disturber
should
be
gone
slowly
these
halting
steps
advanced
feet
that
stumbled
oft
near
they
came
and
nearer
until
beltane
perceived
a
tall
figure
whose
armour
gleamed
dully
and
whose
shoulders
were
bowed
like
one
that
is
feeble
or
very
weary
yolande
said
a
voice
a
hoarse
voice
but
very
tender
yolande
beloved
and
on
the
word
the
voice
broke
and
ended
upon
a
great
sob
swift
followed
by
another
and
yet
another
the
fierce
sobbing
of
a
man
then
beltane
clenched
his
hands
and
rose
up
for
behold
this
man
was
sir
benedict
but
now
and
very
suddenly
sir
benedict
was
upon
his
knees
and
bent
and
kissed
that
white
smooth
stone
whereon
as
yet
was
no
inscription
yolande
he
whispered
now
thou
art
one
among
the
holy
angels
o
forget
not
thy
most
unworthy
benedict
god
o
god
father
to
whom
all
hearts
are
open
thou
dost
know
how
as
child
and
maid
i
loved
her
how
as
a
wife
i
loved
her
still
how
in
my
madness
i
spake
my
love
and
she
being
saint
and
woman
bade
me
to
my
duty
so
by
her
purity
kept
she
my
honour
unstained
beltane
long
scabbard
struck
the
carven
panelling
a
soft
blow
that
yet
echoed
and
in
vaulted
arch
and
dim
roof
and
glancing
swiftly
up
sir
benedict
beheld
him
and
kneeling
thus
beside
the
grave
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
sir
benedict
looked
up
into
beltane
face
with
eyes
wide
eyes
unflinching
but
dimmed
with
great
grief
and
pain
quoth
he
my
lord
thou
hast
learned
my
life
secret
but
ere
thou
dost
judge
me
hear
this
long
ere
thy
princely
father
met
thy
mother
we
loved
she
and
i
and
in
our
love
grew
up
together
then
came
the
duke
thy
father
a
mighty
lord
and
her
mother
was
ambitious
and
very
guileful
and
she
but
a
maid
thus
was
she
then
rode
i
to
the
foreign
wars
seeking
death
but
death
took
me
not
so
the
wars
ended
came
i
home
again
burning
ever
with
my
love
and
sought
her
out
and
beholding
the
sadness
in
her
eyes
i
spake
my
love
and
forgetful
of
honour
and
all
save
her
sweet
soul
and
the
glory
of
her
beauty
i
tempted
her
aye
many
times
tempted
her
in
fashion
merciless
and
cruel
insomuch
that
she
wept
many
bitter
tears
and
upon
a
day
spake
me
thus
true
i
loved
thee
for
thou
wert
a
noble
knight
but
now
an
thy
love
for
me
be
so
small
that
thou
canst
bring
me
to
this
shame
then
take
me
where
thou
wilt
but
shall
all
thy
love
nor
all
my
tears
thereafter
cleanse
us
from
the
shame
of
it
thus
went
i
from
her
nor
have
i
looked
on
woman
since
so
followed
i
thy
father
in
all
his
warring
and
all
my
days
have
i
fought
much
fierce
foes
within
me
and
without
and
lived
a
very
solitary
life
and
she
lieth
dead
and
i
am
here
old
and
worn
a
lonely
man
and
sinful
to
be
judged
of
as
ye
will
then
came
beltane
and
looked
down
into
sir
benedict
pale
sad
face
and
beholding
him
thus
in
his
abasement
haggard
with
wounds
and
bowed
with
grief
needs
must
beltane
kneel
also
and
thereafter
spake
thus
sir
benedict
who
am
i
to
judge
of
such
as
thou
i
tempted
her
i
wooed
her
to
shame
i
that
loved
her
beyond
life
did
cause
her
many
bitter
tears
alas
yet
in
the
end
sir
benedict
because
thy
love
was
a
great
and
noble
love
thou
didst
triumph
over
base
self
so
do
i
honour
thee
and
pray
that
i
in
like
case
may
act
as
nobly
and
now
she
lieth
dead
so
for
me
is
life
ended
also
methinks
she
is
a
saint
in
heaven
benedict
living
forever
as
to
thee
on
whose
skill
and
valiance
the
safety
of
this
fair
city
doth
hang
so
hath
god
need
of
thee
here
methinks
so
now
for
thy
sake
and
for
her
sake
needs
must
i
love
thee
ever
and
always
thou
noble
knight
she
being
dead
yet
liveth
and
shall
go
betwixt
us
henceforth
drawing
us
together
in
closer
bonds
of
love
and
amity
is
it
not
so
dear
my
friend
and
speaking
beltane
reached
out
his
hands
across
his
mother
narrow
grave
and
straightway
came
sir
benedict
hands
swift
and
eager
to
meet
and
clasp
them
for
a
while
knelt
they
thus
hand
clasping
hand
above
that
long
white
stone
whence
stole
to
them
the
mingled
fragrance
of
the
flowers
like
a
silent
benediction
and
presently
together
they
arose
and
went
their
way
but
now
seeing
how
sir
benedict
limped
by
reason
of
his
wounds
beltane
set
an
arm
about
him
so
came
they
together
out
of
the
shadows
into
the
glory
of
the
morning
now
as
they
came
forth
of
the
minster
the
tocsin
rang
loud
in
sudden
alarm
chapter
lxiv
how
giles
cursed
belsaye
out
of
her
fear
within
the
all
was
dire
confusion
men
hasted
hither
and
thither
buckling
on
armour
as
they
went
women
wept
and
children
wailed
while
ever
the
bell
clashed
out
its
fierce
summons
presently
through
the
populace
cometh
sir
brian
of
hartismere
equipped
in
his
armour
and
leaning
on
the
mailed
arm
of
his
brother
eric
of
the
wry
neck
but
perceiving
sir
benedict
and
beltane
they
turned
and
came
up
forthwith
eric
brian
what
meaneth
the
tumult
questioned
sir
benedict
his
eye
kindling
are
we
attacked
so
soon
not
so
answered
sir
brian
at
the
least
not
by
ivo
men
is
worse
than
that
sighed
eric
shaking
his
head
yonder
cometh
a
churchman
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
his
monks
and
with
choristers
and
acolytes
attendant
ha
said
sir
benedict
frowning
and
rubbing
his
chin
i
had
dreaded
this
the
citizens
do
shake
and
shiver
already
i
warrant
me
there
is
nought
like
a
cowl
with
bell
book
and
candle
to
sap
the
courage
of
your
citizen
soldier
let
us
to
the
walls
in
a
corner
hard
by
the
main
gate
they
beheld
giles
holding
forth
to
roger
and
walkyn
and
ulf
but
perceiving
sir
benedict
he
ceased
abruptly
and
advancing
saluted
the
noble
company
each
in
turn
but
addressed
himself
to
sir
benedict
my
lord
quoth
he
eyes
yonder
cometh
a
pompous
prior
that
was
not
very
long
since
nought
but
massy
monk
that
did
upon
a
time
though
by
dint
of
some
small
persuasion
bestow
on
me
a
goodly
ass
my
lord
i
was
bred
a
monk
so
do
i
know
by
divers
signs
and
portents
he
cometh
here
to
ban
the
city
with
book
bell
and
candle
wherefore
the
townsfolk
fearing
greatly
do
shiver
and
shake
especially
the
women
and
maids
sweet
souls
and
lord
by
reason
of
the
matter
of
the
ass
i
do
know
this
priest
prolific
of
damnatory
pronouncements
and
curses
contumacious
o
verily
yet
i
messire
having
been
bred
a
monk
shall
blithely
him
an
the
joy
be
permitted
me
thus
turning
tears
to
laughter
and
gloomy
fear
to
merriment
my
lord
messires
how
say
you
is
blasphemy
unheard
quoth
sir
brian
save
in
the
greenwood
where
men
do
breathe
god
sweet
air
and
live
free
said
eric
and
spake
sir
benedict
stroking
his
square
chin
there
is
a
fear
can
be
quelled
but
by
ridicule
so
may
thy
wit
sir
archer
avail
more
than
our
wisdom
an
thou
canst
make
these
townsfolk
laugh
indeed
how
think
you
my
beltane
that
being
the
wise
and
valiant
knight
thou
art
sir
benedict
thy
will
during
the
siege
is
law
in
belsaye
henceforth
now
hereupon
giles
made
his
obeisance
and
together
with
roger
and
walkyn
and
ulf
hasted
up
to
the
battlement
above
the
gateway
benedict
said
sir
brian
as
they
climbed
the
turret
stair
blasphemy
is
a
dread
and
awful
thing
we
shall
be
excommunicate
one
and
all
better
methinks
to
let
the
populace
yield
up
the
city
and
die
the
death
than
perish
everlastingly
brian
quoth
sir
benedict
pausing
something
breathless
by
reason
of
his
recent
sickness
i
tell
thee
fire
and
pillage
and
ravishment
of
women
is
a
thing
more
dread
and
awful
better
methinks
to
keep
innocence
pure
and
unspotted
while
we
may
and
leave
hereafter
in
the
hands
of
god
and
his
holy
angels
upon
the
tower
there
met
them
the
reeve
anxious
of
brow
who
pointed
where
the
townsfolk
talked
together
in
fearful
undertones
or
clustered
mute
and
trembling
while
every
eye
was
turned
where
in
the
open
town
and
camp
a
procession
of
priests
advanced
chanting
very
solemn
and
sweet
my
lords
said
the
reeve
looking
round
with
haggard
eyes
an
these
priests
do
come
to
pronounce
the
church
awful
malediction
upon
the
city
then
woe
betide
already
there
be
many
aye
some
of
our
chiefest
citizens
do
fear
the
curse
of
holy
church
more
than
the
rapine
of
vile
soldiery
fair
women
shamed
o
christ
lords
ha
messires
there
is
talk
afoot
of
seizing
the
gates
of
opening
to
this
churchman
and
praying
his
intercession
to
ivo
mercy
to
ivo
the
black
that
knoweth
nought
of
mercy
alas
my
lords
once
they
do
ope
the
gates
that
can
they
in
nowise
do
said
sir
benedict
gently
but
with
face
grim
and
every
gate
is
held
by
stout
fellows
of
my
own
following
moreover
i
have
good
hope
yon
churchman
may
leave
us
yet
uncursed
and
sir
benedict
smiled
his
wry
and
twisted
smile
be
you
our
tongue
good
reeve
and
speak
this
churchman
as
thy
bold
heart
dictateth
solemn
and
sweet
rose
the
chanting
voices
growing
ever
more
loud
where
paced
the
priests
first
came
acolytes
swinging
censers
and
next
others
bearing
divers
symbolic
flags
and
standards
and
after
these
again
in
goodly
chair
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
brawny
monks
a
portly
figure
rode
bedight
in
full
canonicals
a
very
solid
cleric
he
and
mightily
round
moreover
his
nose
was
bulbous
and
he
had
a
drooping
lip
slow
and
solemn
the
procession
advanced
and
ever
as
they
came
the
choristers
chanted
full
melodiously
what
time
the
acolytes
swung
their
censers
to
and
fro
and
ever
as
they
came
the
folk
of
belsaye
from
wall
and
turret
eyed
these
monks
with
fearful
looks
and
hearts
cold
and
full
of
dire
misgiving
beyond
the
moat
over
against
the
main
gate
the
procession
halted
the
chair
with
its
portly
burden
was
set
down
and
lifting
up
a
white
hand
the
haughty
cleric
spake
thus
in
voice
mellifluous
and
sweet
whereas
it
hath
pleased
ye
o
rebellious
people
of
belsaye
to
deny
to
cast
off
and
wantonly
repudiate
your
rightful
allegiance
to
your
most
just
most
merciful
and
most
august
lord
ivo
duke
of
pentavalon
whom
god
and
the
saints
defend
amen
and
whereas
ye
have
moreover
made
captive
and
most
barbarously
entreated
certain
of
your
lord
duke
his
ambassadors
unto
you
sent
now
therefore
and
let
all
ears
be
opened
to
my
pronouncements
since
holy
church
doth
speak
ye
one
and
all
each
and
every
through
humble
avenue
of
these
my
lips

o

well
for

to
the
will
of
your

forthwith

full
and

which

rebellious
city
and
all
that

damned
and
excommunicate
now
hereupon
from
all
the
townsfolk
crowding
wall
and
turret
a
groan
went
up
and
full
many
a
ruddy
cheek
grew
pale
at
this
dire
threat
whereupon
the
prior
having
drawn
breath
spake
on
in
voice
more
stern
and
more
peremptory
let
now
your
gates
unbar
yield
ye
unto
your
lord
duke
his
mercy
let
the
gates
unbar
i
say
lest

in
this
life
and
in
the
life
to
come
torment
and
everlasting
fire
let
the
gates
unbar
now
once
again
the
men
of
belsaye
sighed
and
groaned
and
trembled
in
their
armour
while
from
crowded
street
and
rose
buzz
of
fearful
voices
then
spake
the
reeve
in
troubled
tones
his
white
head
above
the
battlement
good
prior
i
pray
you
an
we
unbar
what
surety

we
that

our
city
shall
not

and

cried
the
reeve
in
the
name
of
justice
and
mercy
will
we
yield
this
our
city
until
in
belsaye
no
man
is
left
to
strike
for
maid
and
wife
and
child
at
the
which
bold
words
some
few
men
shouted
in
acclaim
but
for
the
most
part
the
citizens
were
mumchance
their
hearts
cold
within
them
while
all
eyes
stared
fearfully
upon
the
prior
who
lifting
white
hand
again
rose
up
from
cushioned
chair
and
spake
him
loud
and
clear
then
upon
this
rebellious
city
and
all
that
therein
is
on

on

on
youth
on

and
awful

the

sudden
lost
and
drowned

and
full
and
merry
quit

thy
foolish
babblement
thou
fat

naughty
friar

plump

too
round

buxom

should
be
cursed
so

thy
curses
avail
nothing
for

doth
heed
the
fatuous
fulminations
of
a
fat
man
but
as
to
me
i
could
have
thee
in
my
cradle
thou
thing
of
emptiness
go
to
for
a
sounding
brass
and
tinkling
cymbal
thus
from
his
mockery
perched
high
above
the
battlement
spake
giles
with
many
and
divers
knowing
gestures
of
arm
waggings
of
the
head
rollings
of
the
eyes
and
the
like
what
time

bent
close
together
busied
themselves
above
a
great
and
bulging
and
now
on
wall
and
tower
and
a
great
silence
had
fallen
yet
a
silence
broken
now
and
then
by
sound
of
stifled
laughter
while
the
prior
staring
in
wonder
and
amaze
suddenly
clenched
white
fist
and
albeit
very
red
and
fiery
of
visage
strove
to
curse
on

from

from

a
great

was
raised
a

fierce
and

chapter
lxv
telleth
of
roses
a
fair
and
strong
city
was
belsaye
for
as
hath
been
said
to
north
and
east
of
it
the
river
flowed
a
broad
stream
and
deep
while
south
and
west
it
was
fortified
by
a
goodly
moat
wherefore
it
was
to
south
and
west
that
the
besiegers
mustered
their
chief
force
and
set
up
their
mightiest
engines
and
towers
day
in
day
out
mangonel
trebuchet
and
balista
whirred
and
crashed
from
keep
and
tower
and
while
from
every
loophole
and
crenelle
twanged
and
arrows
flew
yet
with
each
succeeding
dawn
the
besiegers
crept
nearer
closing
in
upon
the
city
until
within
close
bowshot
of
the
walls
they
set
up
earthworks
and
stockades
and
from
these
strong
barriers
plied
the
defenders
with
shaft
and
bolt
what
time
their
mighty
engines
advanced
perriers
and
rams
wherewith
to
batter
and
breach
the
city
massy
walls
so
day
in
day
out
eric
chosen
men
plied
trebuchet
and
balista
and
beltane
beholding
the
dire
havoc
wrought
by
heavy
stone
and
whizzing
javelin
among
the
dense
ranks
of
the
besiegers
despite
their
mantlets
and
stout
palisades
grew
sick
at
times
and
was
fain
to
look
otherwhere
but
the
besiegers
were
many
and
duke
ivo
had
sworn
swift
destruction
on
belsaye
thus
heedless
of
all
else
he
pushed
on
the
attack
until
despite
their
heavy
losses
his
men
were
firmly
established
close
beyond
the
moat
wherefore
my
beltane
waxed
full
anxious
and
was
for
sallying
out
to
destroy
their
works
at
the
which
gloomy
sir
hacon
limping
in
his
many
bandages
grew
suddenly
jovial
and
fain
was
to
call
for
horse
and
lance
forthwith
quoth
sir
benedict
placidly
nay
let
them
come
messires
they
are
a
sea
but
belsaye
is
a
rock
duke
ivo
is
cunning
in
war
but
is
mark
me
a
passionate
man
and
he
who
fighteth
in
blind
anger
fighteth
ill
so
let
them
come
i
say
the
time
for
us
to
beware
is
when
ivo
hot
temper
shall
have
cooled
ha
look
yonder
and
sir
benedict
pointed
where
a
great
wooden
tower
urged
forward
by
rope
and
pulley
and
winch
was
creeping
near
and
nearer
the
walls
now
stopping
jerkily
now
advancing
its
massy
timbers
protected
from
fire
by
raw
hides
its
summit
bristling
with
archers
and
men
who
from
their
lofty
post
began
to
sweep
wall
and
turret
with
their
whizzing
shafts
now
mark
yon
tower
said
sir
benedict
closing
his
vizor
here
shall
be
good
sport
for
eric
perriers
watch
now
and
he
nodded
where
on
the
battlement
below
crouched
eric
with
walkyn
and
roger
who
laboured
at
the
winches
of
a
great
trebuchet
hard
by
to
left
and
right
on
wall
and
turret
eric
glanced
then
blew
a
blast
upon
the
horn
he
carried
and
immediately
from
wall
and
turret
mangonels
trebuchets
and
balistae
unknown
of
until
now
crashed
and
whirred
and
the
tall
tower
shook
and
quivered
the
shock
of
great
stones
and
heavy
bolts
its
massy
timbers
were
split
and
rent
insomuch
that
it
was
fain
to
be
withdrawn
thereafter
the
besiegers
brought
up
a
long
or
cat
unto
the
edge
of
the
moat
and
sheltered
within
this
cat
were
many
men
who
fell
to
work
filling
up
the
moat
with
bags
of
earth
and
stone
werewith
to
form
a
causeway
across
which
they
might
assault
the
wall
with
bore
and
ram
and
because
this
cat
was
builded
very
strong
eric
engines
battered
it
in
vain
wherefore
he
presently
desisted
thus
hour
by
hour
the
causeway
grew
and
lengthened
so
needs
must
beltane
seek
sir
benedict
and
point
this
out
with
anxious
finger
let
them
come
beltane
quoth
sir
benedict
placid
as
was
his
wont
once
they
are
close
against
the
wall
with
ram
i
will
make
their
labour
of
no
avail
you
shall
see
me
burn
them
with
a
brew
i
learned
of
in
the
foreign
wars
so
let
them
come
beltane
thus
day
in
day
out
was
roar
of
conflict
about
the
walls
of
belsaye
town
and
ever
sir
benedict
with
beltane
beside
him
went
to
and
fro
quick
of
eye
and
hand
swift
to
foresee
and
counteract
the
tactics
of
the
besiegers
meeting
cunning
artifice
with
crafty
strategem
wheresoever
was
panic
or
pressing
need
there
was
sir
benedict
and
serene
and
beltane
watching
him
thus
came
to
understand
why
this
man
had
withstood
the
powers
of
duke
ivo
all
these
years
and
why
all
men
trusted
to
his
judgment
thus
all
day
was
rage
of
battle
but
with
the
night
peace
came
since
in
the
dark
men
might
not
see
to
aim
and
slay
each
other
and
by
night
the
folk
of
belsaye
made
good
their
battered
walls
what
time
the
besiegers
prepared
fresh
devices
of
attack
every
morning
at
sunrise
it
was
beltane
custom
to
steal
to
the
great
minster
and
despite
his
armour
come
to
his
mother
grave
to
hold
communion
with
her
in
his
prayers
and
lo
upon
that
hallowed
stone
there
always
he
found
fragrant
flowers
roses
and
lilies
upon
whose
sweet
petals
the
dew
yet
sparkled
and
ever
his
wonder
grew
more
than
once
he
had
thought
to
hear
again
that
indefinable
stir
and
whisper
the
which
had
thrilled
him
on
that
first
morning
and
starting
up
he
would
peer
into
the
vague
shadows
twice
he
had
thought
to
see
a
draped
figure
bending
above
that
long
white
stone
a
veiled
figure
slender
and
graceful
that
upon
his
approach
soft
though
it
was
flitted
swiftly
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
choir
once
he
had
followed
and
stood
amazed
to
see
it
vanish
through
the
carven
panelling
though
door
could
he
find
none
therefore
was
he
sore
perplexed
and
oft
would
touch
the
dewy
flowers
as
half
expecting
they
should
vanish
also
now
upon
a
certain
dawn
he
had
hid
himself
within
the
shadows
and
waited
with
bated
breath
and
heart
strangely
and
with
the
she
came
again
tall
and
gracious
in
her
clinging
draperies
and
long
green
veil
then
even
as
she
bent
to
lay
the
flowers
upon
the
grave
came
beltane
soft
of
foot
and
spake
ere
she
was
of
him
lady
now
though
his
voice
was
very
low
and
gentle
she
started
the
flowers
fell
from
her
loosened
clasp
and
after
a
moment
she
turned
and
fronted
him
proud
head
beneath
her
veil
so
stood
they
within
that
place
of
silence
while
high
above
the
great
window
grew
luminous
with
coming
day
lady
said
he
again
for
thy
sweet
flowers
for
thy
sweeter
thought
for
one
that
is
gone
fain
would
i
thank
thee
for
she
who
lieth
here
i
found
and
loved
and
have
lost
again
a
while
she
did
love
all
fair
things
so
loved
she
the
flowers
methinks
yet
i
who
have
grieved
for
my
noble
mother
thought
to
bring
her
flowers
this
did
need
a
woman
gentle
soul
so
for
thy
flowers
i
do
most
truly
thank
thee
very
still
she
stood
nor
spake
nor
moved
save
for
the
sweet
hurry
of
her
breathing
and
beholding
her
thus
of
a
sudden
beltane
heart
leapt
and
he
fell
though
wherefore
he
knew
not
only
yearned
he
mightily
to
look
beneath
her
veil
and
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
stillness
she
must
needs
hear
the
passionate
throbbing
of
his
heart
twice
would
he
have
spoken
yet
could
not
at
last
beseech
thee
he
whispered
o
beseech
thee
unveil
that
i
may
behold
the
face
of
one
so
tender
to
her
that
was
my
mother
o
beseech
thee
as
he
spake
he
drew
a
swift
pace
nearer
hand
outstretched
in
supplication
but
because
this
hand
shook
and
quivered
so
he
clenched
it
whereat
the
unknown
shrank
back
and
back
and
turning
swift
and
sudden
was
gone
a
while
stood
my
beltane
his
head
and
fell
to
wonderment
because
of
the
so
painful
throbbing
of
his
heart
then
knelt
he
above
his
mother
grave
with
hands
dear
mother
in
heaven
he
sighed
being
an
angel
thou
dost
know
all
my
heart
its
hopes
and
fears
thou
hast
seen
me
tremble
thou
dost
know
wherefore
this
my
heart
doth
yearn
so
bitterly
o
sweet
mother
with
god
plead
thou
on
my
behalf
that
i
may
be
worthy
her
love
meet
to
her
embracements
fit
for
so
great
happiness
angel
of
god
thou
dost
know
how
great
is
my
desire
how
empty
life
without
her
o
mother
aid
me
in
a
while
he
arose
and
immediately
beheld
that
which
lay
beyond
his
mother
grave
full
in
the
radiance
of
the
great
east
window
a
thing
small
and
slender
and
daintily
wrought
and
stooping
he
picked
up
a
little
shoe
of
soft
leather
it
was
fashioned
cunningly
pinked
and
sewn
here
and
there
with
coloured
silks
and
as
he
stared
down
at
it
so
in
his
mailed
hand
his
heart
leapt
again
and
again
his
strong
hand
fell
of
a
sudden
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
then
coming
to
his
mother
grave
very
reverently
took
thence
a
single
great
bloom
and
thrusting
the
shoe
in
the
wallet
at
his
girdle
that
same
wallet
sir
fidelis
had
borne
went
out
into
the
golden
dawn
like
one
in
a
dream
went
beltane
heedless
of
his
going
by
silent
street
and
lane
where
none
stirred
at
this
early
hour
thus
he
wandered
on
until
he
was
stayed
by
a
high
wall
wherein
was
set
a
small
green
door
as
he
stood
staring
down
at
the
rose
he
held
and
lost
in
pleasant
dream
he
was
aroused
by
a
scrambling
sound
near
by
and
glancing
up
beheld
a
mailed
head
and
shoulders
rise
suddenly
above
the
wall
and
so
looked
into
the
face
of
giles
o
the
bow
now
in
his
teeth
giles
bare
a
great
red
rose
even
as
that
which
beltane
held
giles
quoth
he
sharp
and
stern
whence
had
ye
that
flower
for
answer
giles
straddling
the
wall
laid
finger
to
lip
then
dropping
to
his
feet
drew
beltane
down
an
adjacent
lane
lord
said
he
yonder
is
the
reeve
garden
and
in
the
garden
cometh
the
reeve
to
taste
the
sweet
dawn
wherefore
giles
doth
incontinent
vanish
him
over
the
reeve
wall
because
of
the
reeve
nevertheless
needs
must
i
bless
the
reeve
because
of
the
daughter
though
verily
both
in
my
speech
and
in
the
reeve
garden
is
too
much
reeve
methinks
as
to
this
rose
now
ha
how
came
you
by
the
rose
giles
why
in
the
first
place
tall
brother
i
stole
it
stole
it
repeated
beltane
and
behold
his
frown
was
gone
completely
but
in
the
second
place
brother
was
given
to
me
given
to
thee
by
whom
and
immediately
beltane
frown
was
back
again
and
therefore
in
the
third
place
brother
giles
this
day
would
not
change
skins
with
any
lord
duke
archduke
pope
or
potentate
that
went
in
skin
who
gave
it
thee
speak
man
faith
lord
i
had
it
from
one
as
pure
as
fair
as
aye
but
what
like
is
she
like
unto
this
flower
for
sweetness
lord
and
ha
saints
and
martyrs
whence
had
ye
that
bloom
tall
brother
speak
and
giles
pointed
to
the
rose
in
beltane
fingers
what
like
is
she
answer
me
alack
sighed
giles
shaking
gloomy
head
she
is
very
like
a
woman
after
all
methinks
mean
ye
the
reeve
daughter
even
so
lord
doth
she
wear
ever
a
a
green
veil
giles
verily
lord
and
with
a
most
sweet
grace
and
her
shoes
her
shoes
tall
brother
o
methinks
her
sweet
shoe
doth
kiss
the
earth
so
sweet
and
light
poor
earth
must
needs
love
and
languish
as
doth
poor
giles
her
shoe
is
it
aught
like
to
this
giles
and
forthwith
beltane
took
out
the
little
shoe
aye
is
her
very
own
master
groaned
giles
ah
woe
is
me
for
if
she
hath
given
to
thee
rose
and
therewith
her
pretty
shoe
thou
hast
belike
her
heart
also
and
with
her
heart
nay
take
it
giles
take
it
quoth
beltane
sighing
i
did
but
find
it
in
my
going
and
this
rose
i
found
also
but
this
will
i
keep
methinks
thy
love
is
what
thy
heart
telleth
thee
a
maid
very
gentle
and
sweet
so
god
prosper
thy
wooing
giles
so
saying
beltane
thrust
the
shoe
upon
bewildered
giles
and
turning
swiftly
about
hasted
away
but
even
then
while
the
archer
yet
stared
after
him
beltane
turned
and
came
striding
back
giles
quoth
he
how
tall
is
the
reeve
daughter
lord
she
is
better
than
tall
ha
is
she
short
of
stature
good
giles
messire
god
hath
shaped
her
lovely
body
no
higher
and
no
lower
than
my
heart
small
is
she
and
slender
yet
in
her
sweet
and
slender
shapeliness
is
all
the
beauty
of
all
the
women
that
all
men
have
ever
loved
small
say
you
giles
small
then
give
me
back
yon
lovely
thing
saying
the
which
beltane
caught
the
shoe
from
giles
hold
and
strode
away
blithe
and
debonair
leaving
the
garrulous
archer
dumb
for
once
and
beyond
all
words
amazed
now
as
beltane
went
very
deep
in
thought
there
met
him
friar
martin
who
bore
upon
his
arm
a
great
basket
full
of
green
vegetables
and
sweet
herbs
quoth
beltane
good
friar
what
do
ye
abroad
so
early
sweet
son
i
praise
the
good
god
for
his
mercies
and
pant
by
reason
of
this
my
weighty
basket
indeed
is
a
something
basket
said
beltane
relieving
the
friar
of
his
burden
with
gentle
force
why
verily
my
children
are
hungry
children
and
clamour
to
be
filled
and
see
you
my
son
i
have
a
secret
of
a
certain
broth
whereof
these
lentils
and
these
sweet
herbs
do
so
tickle
their
palates
that
to
satisfy
them
is
a
hard
matter
more
especially
orson
and
jenkyn
who
being
nigh
cured
of
their
hurts
do
eat
like
four
men
and
vaunt
my
cooking
insomuch
that
i
must
needs
grow
heedful
of
vain
pride
fain
would
i
see
these
children
of
thine
an
i
may
good
friar
so
will
i
bear
thy
burden
for
thee
verily
they
shall
rejoice
to
see
thee
quoth
the
friar
but
for
my
basket
methinks
is
better
suited
to
my
habit
than
thy
knightly
mail
for
answer
beltane
slipped
the
basket
on
his
arm
and
they
went
on
together
talking
of
many
things
thus
the
gentle
friar
brought
him
at
last
to
a
portal
within
a
narrow
lane
and
pushing
open
the
door
ushered
him
into
the
great
refectory
of
the
abbey
where
beltane
set
down
the
basket
and
friar
martin
rolling
up
his
sleeves
brought
pot
and
pannikin
but
paused
to
smile
and
shake
his
head
as
from
a
passage
hard
by
came
the
sound
of
voices
raised
in
altercation
my
children
do
grow
a
little
fractious
at
times
quoth
he
as
is
but
natural
methinks
yonder
you
shall
hear
orson
and
jenkyn
who
having
saved
each
other
life
in
battle
and
loving
like
brothers
do
oft
contend
together
with
tongues
most
ungentle
go
you
my
son
and
quiet
me
the
naughty
rogues
so
saying
friar
martin
fell
to
washing
and
preparing
his
herbs
and
vegetables
whiles
beltane
hasting
down
the
passage
opened
a
certain
door
and
entered
a
cool
and
airy
dormitory
where
upon
pallets
neat
and
orderly
lay
divers
fellows
whose
hurts
were
swathed
in
fair
white
linen
and
who
despite
their
bandages
started
up
on
hand

very
sweet
and
delicate
master
in
a
while
beltane
arose
and
going
from
bed
to
bed
spake
with
each
and
every
and
went
his
way
leaving
orson
and
jenkyn
to
their
recriminations
being
come
back
into
the
refectory
he
found
friar
martin
yet
busied
with
the
preparations
of
his
cooking
and
seating
himself
upon
the
great
table
hard
by
fell
to
a
profound
meditation
watched
ever
and
anon
by
the
friar
kindly
eyes
so
very
silent
and
thoughtful
was
he
that
the
friar
presently
looked
up
from
slicing
and
cutting
his
vegetables
and
spake
with
smile
wondrous
tender
wherefore
so
pensive
my
son
good
father
i
think
and
dream
of
red
roses
friar
martin
cut
and
trimmed
a
leek
with
great
care
yet
surely
here
was
no
reason
for
his
eyes
to
twinkle
within
the
shadow
of
his
white
cowl
a
sweet
and
fragrant
thought
my
son
quoth
he
as
sweet
methinks
holy
father
as
pure
and
fragrant
as
she
herself
my
son
as
helen
good
friar
as
helen
the
beautiful
duchess
of
mortain
ah
sighed
the
friar
and
forthwith
popped
the
leek
into
the
pot
i
prithee
noble
son
reach
me
the
yonder
chapter
lxvi
concerning
a
blue
camlet
cloak
next
morning
ere
the
sun
was
up
came
beltane
into
the
minster
and
hiding
within
the
deeper
gloom
of
the
choir
sat
there
hushing
his
breath
to
listen
trembling
in
eager
anticipation
slowly
amid
the
dimness
above
came
a
glimmer
from
the
great
window
a
pale
beam
that
grew
with
dawn
until
up
rose
the
sun
and
the
window
glowed
in
splendour
and
in
a
while
to
beltane
straining
senses
came
the
faint
creak
of
a
door
a
soft
rustle
the
swift
light
tread
of
feet
and
starting
forth
of
his
lurking
place
he
stepped
forward
with
yearning
arms
outstretched
then
paused
of
a
sudden
beholding
her
who
stood
at
gaze
one
slender
foot
advanced
and
white
hands
full
of
roses
and
lilies
one
as
fair
as
sweet
and
pure
as
the
fragrant
blooms
she
bore
small
was
she
and
slender
and
of
a
radiant
loveliness
red
of
lip
and
now
beholding
beltane
thus
suddenly
she
shrank
and
uttered
a
soft
cry
nay
quoth
he
fear
me
not
sweet
maid
methought
thee
other
than
thou
art
i
grieve
that
i
did
fright
thee
forgive
me
i
pray
so
saying
he
sighed
and
bowing
full
humbly
turned
but
even
so
paused
again
thou
art
methinks
the
reeve
fair
daughter
thou
art
the
lady
genevra
he
questioned
aye
my
lord
then
an
thou
dost
love
gentle
maid
heaven
send
thee
happier
in
thy
love
than
i
at
the
which
genevra
gentle
eyes
grew
softer
yet
and
her
sweet
mouth
full
pitiful
and
tender
art
thou
so
unhappy
lord
beltane
aye
truly
he
sighed
and
drooped
mournful
head
ah
messire
then
fain
would
i
aid
thee
an
i
might
said
she
then
where
i
pray
you
is
she
that
came
here
yesterday
nay
lord
how
may
i
tell
thee
this
there
be
many
women
in
belsaye
town
for
me
quoth
beltane
in
all
the
world
there
is
but
one
and
to
this
one
alas
thou
canst
not
aid
me
yet
for
thy
kind
intent
i
thank
thee
and
so
farewell
sweet
maid
thus
saying
he
took
three
steps
away
from
her
then
turning
came
back
in
two
stay
quoth
he
slipping
hand
in
wallet
know
you
this
shoe
now
beholding
this
genevra
red
lips
quivered
roguishly
and
she
bowed
her
little
shapely
head
indeed
my
lord
is
mine
said
she
then
pray
you
who
was
she
did
wear
it
yesterday
aye
messire
was
yesterday
i
missed
it
wilt
not
give
it
me
therefore
one
shoe
can
avail
thee
nothing
and
and
is
too
small
for
thee
to
wear
methinks
did
she
she
that
lost
this
yesterday
send
thee
in
her
stead
wilt
not
give
a
poor
maid
her
shoe
again
messire
o
genevra
beseech
thee
who
was
she
did
wear
it
yesterday
speak
nay
this
this
i
may
not
tell
thee
lord
beltane
and
wherefore
for
that
i
did
so
promise
and
yet
what
seek
you
of
her
my
lord
forgiveness
said
beltane
hot
and
eager
i
would
woo
her
sweet
clemency
on
one
that
hath
wrought
her
grievous
wrong
o
sweet
genevra
wilt
not
say
where
i
may
find
her
a
while
stood
the
maid
genevra
with
bowed
head
as
one
in
doubt
then
looked
on
him
with
sweet
maiden
eyes
and
of
a
sudden
smiled
compassionate
and
tender
ah
messire
said
she
surely
thine
are
the
eyes
of
one
who
loveth
greatly
and
well
and
i
do
so
love
her
that
fain
would
i
have
her
greatly
loved
so
will
i
tell
thee
despite
my
word
hearken
and
drawing
him
near
she
laid
white
finger
to
rosy
lip
and
thereafter
spake
in
whispers
go
you
to
the
green
door
where
yesterday
thou
didst
meet
with
gi
with
the
captain
of
the
archers
o
verily
we
she
and
i
my
lord
did
see
and
hear
all
that
passed
betwixt
you
and
upon
this
door
knock
you
softly
three
times
go
yet
o
prithee
say
not
was
genevra
told
thee
this
and
again
she
laid
white
finger
to
roguish
pouting
lip
then
beltane
stooped
and
catching
that
little
hand
kissed
it
and
thereafter
hasted
blithely
on
his
way
swift
of
foot
went
he
and
with
eyes
nor
paused
in
his
long
stride
until
he
was
come
to
a
certain
high
wall
wherein
was
set
the
small
green
door
whereon
he
knocked
three
times
and
presently
he
heard
the
bar
softly
raised
the
door
was
opened
slow
and
cautiously
and
stooping
beltane
stepped
beneath
the
lintel
and
stood
suddenly
still
staring
into
the
face
of
black
roger
and
even
as
beltane
stared
thus
amazed
so
stared
roger
why
master
quoth
he
pushing
back
his
to
rumple
his
black
hair
why
master
you
you
be
early
abroad
though
forsooth
a
fair
morning
and
roger
quoth
beltane
looking
round
upon
a
fair
garden
with
flowers
roger
where
is
the
duchess
helen
ha
so
ye
do
know
master
who
hath
discovered
it
where
is
she
roger
lord
quoth
roger
giving
a
sudden
sideways
jerk
of
his
head
how
should
roger
tell
thee
this
now
even
as
he
spake
roger
must
needs
gesture
again
with
his
head
and
therewith
close
one
bright
black
eye
and
with
stealthy
finger
point
to
a
certain
tall
hedge
hard
by
all
of
which
was
seen
by
one
who
stood
beyond
the
hedge
watching
beltane
with
eyes
that
missed
nought
of
him
from
golden
spur
to
golden
head
quick
to
note
his
flushing
cheek
his
parted
lips
and
the
eager
light
of
his
blue
eyes
one
who
perceiving
him
turn
whither
roger
sly
finger
pointed
gathered
up
her
flowing
robe
in
both
white
hands
that
she
might
flee
the
faster
and
who
speeding
swift
and
light
came
to
a
certain
leafy
bower
where
stood
a
tambour
frame
and
sitting
there
with
draperies
well
ordered
caught
up
silk
and
needle
yet
paused
to
close
her
eyes
and
set
one
hand
upon
rounded
bosom
what
time
a
quick
firm
step
drew
near
and
ever
nearer
with
clash
and
ring
of
heavy
mail
until
beltane
stood
before
her
and
how
was
he
to
know
of
the
eyes
that
had
watched
him
through
the
hedge
or
that
the
hand
that
held
the
needle
had
paused
lest
he
should
see
how
direfully
it
trembled
how
should
my
beltane
know
all
this
who
was
but
a
very
man
a
while
stood
he
viewing
her
with
eyes
aglow
with
yearning
tenderness
and
she
knowing
this
kept
her
face
therefore
now
beholding
all
the
beauty
of
her
because
of
her
gracious
loveliness
his
breath
caught
then
hurried
thick
and
fast
insomuch
that
when
he
would
have
spoken
he
could
not
thus
he
worshipped
her
in
a
look
and
she
content
to
be
so
worshipped
sat
with
head
as
sweetly
demure
as
proud
and
stately
as
if
as
if
she
in
all
her
days
had
fled
with
hampering
draperies
caught
up
so
high
so
beltane
stood
worshipping
her
as
she
had
been
some
young
goddess
in
whose
immortal
beauty
all
beauty
was
embodied
at
last
he
spake
hoarse
and
low
and
passionate
helen
said
he
o
helen
slowly
slowly
the
duchess
lifted
stately
head
and
looked
on
him
but
now
behold
her
glance
was
high
and
proud
her
scarlet
mouth
like
the
white
and
dimpled
chin
below
and
her
eyes
swept
him
with
look
calm
and
most
dispassionate
ah
my
lord
beltane
she
said
what
do
you
here
within
the
privacy
of
genevra
garden
now
because
of
the
sweet
serenity
of
her
speech
because
of
the
calm
unswerving
directness
of
her
gaze
my
beltane
felt
at
sudden
loss
his
outstretched
arms
sank
helplessly
and
he
fell
helen
i
i
o
helen
i
have
dreamed
of
yearned
for
this
hour
to
see
thee
again
to
hear
thy
voice
and
yet
and
yet
well
my
lord
now
stood
beltane
very
still
staring
on
her
in
dumb
amaze
and
the
pain
in
his
eyes
smote
her
insomuch
that
she
bent
to
her
embroidery
and
sewed
three
stitches
woefully
askew
o
surely
surely
i
am
mad
quoth
he
wondering
or
i
do
dream
for
she
i
seek
is
a
woman
gentle
and
prone
to
forgiveness
one
beyond
all
women
fair
and
brave
and
noble
in
whose
pure
heart
can
nothing
evil
be
in
whose
gentle
eyes
her
gentle
soul
lieth
mirrored
whose
tender
lips
be
apt
and
swift
to
speak
mercy
and
forgiveness
even
as
her
soft
kind
hands
did
bind
up
my
wounds
so
methought
she
with
gentle
sayings
might
heal
my
grieving
heart
and
now
now
o
my
lord
she
sighed
bending
over
idle
fingers
methinks
you
came
seeking
an
angel
of
heaven
and
find
here
only
a
woman
yet
is
this
woman
i
do
love
and
ever
must
is
this
woman
i
did
know
as
fidelis
alas
she
sighed
again
alas
poor
fidelis
thou
didst
drive
him
from
thee
into
the
solitary
so
is
poor
fidelis
lost
to
thee
methinks
nay
helen
o
helen
be
just
to
me
thou
dost
know
i
loved
fidelis
yet
thou
didst
spurn
and
name
him
traitor
and
drave
him
from
thee
now
of
a
sudden
he
strode
towards
her
and
as
he
came
her
bosom
swelled
her
lashes
drooped
for
it
seemed
he
meant
to
clasp
her
to
his
heart
but
lo
being
only
man
my
beltane
paused
and
trembled
and
dared
not
touch
her
and
sinking
before
her
on
his
knees
spake
very
humbly
and
with
head
helen
show
me
a
little
mercy
he
pleaded
that
i
abase
myself
then
here
here
behold
me
at
thy
feet
fearing
thee
because
of
my
unworthiness
but
o
believe
believe
for
every
base
doubt
of
thee
this
heart
hath
known
now
doth
it
grieve
remorseful
for
every
harsh
and
bitter
word
this
tongue
hath
spoke
thee
now
doth
it
humbly
crave
thy
pitiful
forgiveness
but
know
you
this
that
from
the
evil
hour
i
drave
thee
from
me
i
have
known
abiding
sorrow
and
remorse
for
without
thee
life
is
indeed
but
an
empty
thing
and
i
a
creature
lost
and
desolate
o
helen
pity
me
thus
spake
he
humble
and
broken
and
she
beholding
him
thus
sighed
though
wondrous
softly
and
her
long
lashes
tears
glittered
though
swift
dashed
away
but
slowly
very
slowly
one
white
hand
came
out
to
him
faltered
stopped
and
glancing
up
she
rose
in
haste
and
shrank
away
now
beltane
perceiving
only
this
last
gesture
sprang
up
how
quoth
he
am
i
then
become
a
thing
so
base
my
presence
doth
offend
thee
then
as
god
liveth
shalt
see
me
more
until
thou
thyself
do
summon
me
even
as
he
spake
thus
swift
and
passionate
giles
clambered
the
adjacent
wall
and
dropping
softly
within
the
garden
stared
to
behold
beltane
striding
towards
him
who
catching
him
by
the
arm
yet
viewing
him
not
spun
him
from
his
path
and
coming
to
the
green
door
sped
out
and
away
now
as
giles
stood
to
rub
his
arm
and
gape
in
wonderment
he
started
to
find
the
duchess
beside
him
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
cheeks
very
red
and
meeting
her
look
poor
giles
fell
suddenly
abashed
noble
lady
he
faltered
foolish
giles
said
she
go
summon
me
my
faithful
roger
but
as
she
spake
behold
roger
himself
hasting
to
her
through
the
roses
roger
said
she
frowning
a
little
saw
you
my
lord
go
but
now
aye
verily
dear
my
lady
quoth
he
ruffling
up
his
hair
but
wherefore
and
i
said
giles
cherishing
his
arm
both
saw
and
felt
him
ha
quoth
roger
have
him
back
sweet
mistress
why
truly
i
would
roger
then
forsooth
will
i
go
fetch
him
nay
rather
would
i
die
roger
but
dear
lady
an
thou
dost
want
him
i
will
bring
him
by
other
means
said
the
duchess
aye
he
shall
come
despite
himself
and
her
red
lips
curved
to
sudden
roguish
smile
as
smiling
thus
she
brought
them
to
a
certain
arbour
very
shady
and
remote
and
seating
herself
looked
from
one
tanned
face
to
the
other
and
spake
them
certain
matters
whereat
the
archer
merry
eyes
grew
merrier
yet
but
roger
sighed
and
shook
his
head
said
he
lady
here
is
tale
shall
wring
his
noble
heart
methinks
wherefore
the
telling
shall
wring
mine
also
then
speak
not
of
it
roger
be
this
giles
mission
aye
rogerkin
leave
it
to
me
in
faith
noble
lady
i
will
with
suggestion
soft
and
subtle
with
knowing
look
and
wily
wag
of
head
so
work
upon
my
lord
that
he
shall
hither
haste
at
moonrise
said
the
duchess
softly
this
evening
at
moonrise
verily
lady
at
moonrise
and
a
blue
camlet
cloak
say
you
come
giles
and
i
will
give
it
thee
meanwhile
beltane
hurt
and
angry
betook
him
to
the
walls
where
bow
and
perrier
had
already
begun
their
deadly
morning
work
and
coming
to
a
quiet
corner
of
the
battlement
he
leaned
him
there
to
watch
where
the
besiegers
under
cover
of
the
cat
that
hourly
crept
more
nigh
worked
amain
to
dam
the
moat
now
as
he
leaned
thus
a
hand
slipped
within
his
arm
and
turning
he
beheld
sir
benedict
a
right
fair
morning
my
beltane
quoth
he
aye
truly
benedict
sighed
beltane
though
there
be
clouds
to
the
west
and
the
causeway
across
the
moat
groweth
apace
i
have
watched
yon
cat
creep
a
full
yard
aye
verily
by
beltane
reach
our
wall
then
will
they
advance
their
ram
to
the
battery
methinks
and
what
then
benedict
then
shall
we
destroy
their
ram
forthwith
with
dear
lad
aye
and
how
then

maintain
our
walls

year
or
two
or
three
yet
in
the
end
belsaye
must
fall
and
i
tell

ivo
twice
as
strong
belsaye
should
yet
withstand
him
so
gloom

and
behold
my
arm
is
healed
thanks
to
to
skilful
nursing
of
the
duchess
helen

so
hast
found
it
out
at
last
lad
knew
you
she
was
here
aye
verily
and
told
me
not
for
that
she
did
so
command
beltane
and
wherefore
came
she
hither
for
thy
dear
sake
in
the
first
place
and
nay
mock
me
not
friend
for
i
do
know
myself
of
none
account
and
in
the
second
place
beltane
to
save
this
fair
city
of
belsaye
nay
how
mean
you
i
mean
that
belsaye
can
not
fall
whiles
it
holdeth
helen
the
proud
and
the
reason
this
now
mark
me
beltane
since
her
father
death
duke
ivo
hath
had
his
glutton
eye
on
fair
mortain
whereof
her
counsellors
did
ken
yet
being
old
men
and
averse
to
war
would
fain
have
had
her
wed
with
him
now
upon
a
day
word
reached
me
in
thrasfordham
bidding
me
come
to
her
and
waldron
of
brand
at
winisfarne
so
as
thou
dost
know
stole
i
from
my
goodly
castle
and
marched
north
but
on
the
way
she
came
to
me
bedight
in
mail
and
she
and
i
took
counsel
together
wherefore
came
she
hither
to
belsaye
and
sent
speedy
messengers
to
sir
jocelyn
of
alain
and
others
of
her
greatest
lords
and
knights
bidding
them
come
down
with
all
their
powers
nay
why
shake
ye
gloomy
head
fond
boy
body
o
me
beltane
i
tell
thee
this
she
sighed
beltane
frowning
she
spurneth
me
kneeling
at
her
feet
as
i
was
she
shrank
away
as
i
had
leprous
been
aye
lad
and
then
didst
woo
as
well
as
kneel
to
her
didst
clasp
her
to
thee
lift
her
proud
head
that
needs
must
she
give
to
thine
her
eyes
she
is
in
sooth
very
woman
did
you
this
my
beltane
ah
dear
benedict
she
that
i
love
was
not
wont
to
shrink
from
me
thus
is
true
i
am
unworthy
and
yet
she
spurned
me
so
is
her
love
dead
methinks
so
art
thou
but
youth
and
foolish
youth
and
belike
foolish
hungry
youth
so
come
let
us
break
our
fast
together
not
i
benedict
for
if
love
be
dead
no
mind
have
i
to
food
o
lad
lad
sighed
sir
benedict
would
i
had
one
as
fair
and
noble
to
love
me
in
such
sort
and
turning
he
gazed
towards
belsaye
great
minster
and
sighing
went
his
way
and
presently
as
beltane
leaned
thus
grieving
and
alone
cometh
giles
that
way
who
pausing
beside
him
peered
down
where
the
besiegers
but
by
battered
mantlet
and
palisades
strove
amain
to
bring
up
one
of
their
rams
since
the
causeway
across
the
moat
was
complete
holy
saints
quoth
giles
the
rogues
grow
bold
and
venturesome
methinks
so
saying
he
strung
his
powerful
bow
and
laying
arrows
to
his
hand
fell
to
drawing
and
loosing
amain
so
swift
shot
he
and
with
aim
so
true
that
in
a
while
the
enemy
gave
over
their
attempt
and
betook
them
to
cover
what
time
their
archers
and
plied
the
wall
with
a
storm
of
shafts
and
bolts
upon
this
giles
laying
by
his
bow
seated
himself
in
corner
well
screened
from
harm
beckoning
beltane
to
do
the
like
since
the
missiles
whizzed
and
whistled
perilously
near
but
sighing
beltane
closed
his
vizor
and
heedless
of
flying
bolt
and
arrow
strode
to
the
narrow
stair
that
led
up
to
the
and
being
come
there
sat
him
down
beside
the
great
mangonel
but
lo
very
soon
giles
was
there
also
and
even
as
beltane
sighed
so
sighed
giles
heigho
a
sorry
world
brother
quoth
he
a
sorry
world
and
forthwith
fell
to
his
archery
yet
now
though
his
aim
was
true
as
ever
he
sighed
and
murmured
plaintively
every
shot
alack
a
sorry
world
so
deep
and
oft
were
his
sighs
so
plaintive
his
groans
that
beltane
though
plunged
in
bitter
thought
must
needs
at
length
take
heed
of
him
giles
quoth
he
looking
up
a
heaven
name
what
aileth
thee
man
is
my
eyes
lord
thine
eyes
are
well
enough
giles
and
see
wondrous
well
to
judge
by
thy
shooting
wondrous
well
aye
there
it
is
tall
brother
mine
eyes
do
see
wondrous
well
mine
eyes
do
see
so
much
see
you
that
they
do
see
aye
too
too
much
alack
is
a
sorry
and
woeful
world
brother
beshrew
my
eyes
i
say
and
wherefore
giles
for
that
these
eyes
do
see
what
other
eyes
see
not
thine
methinks
saw
nought
of
a
fine
lusty
and
fellow
in
a
camlet
cloak
within
the
reeve
garden
this
morning
i
warrant
me
now
a
tall
shapely
rogue
well
see
you
and
very
debonair
nay
not
i
said
beltane
and
sighing
he
arose
and
descended
to
the
battlement
above
the
gates
and
presently
behold
giles
was
there
also
brother
quoth
he
selecting
an
arrow
with
portentous
care
is
an
ill
thing
to
be
cursed
with
eyes
such
as
mine
i
tell
thee
aye
and
wherefore
giles
said
beltane
yet
intent
on
his
own
thoughts
for
that
they
do
see
more
than
is
good
for
this
heart
o
mine
as
this
fellow
in
the
blue
camlet
cloak
what
fellow
giles
the
buxom
fellow
that
was
in
the
reeve
garden
this
morning
why
then
quoth
beltane
turning
away
go
you
not
to
the
garden
giles
all
day
long
beltane
kept
the
wall
eating
not
at
all
wherefore
his
gloom
waxed
the
more
profound
so
spake
he
to
few
men
and
oft
exposed
himself
to
shaft
and
missile
and
so
all
day
long
wheresoever
he
came
on
tower
or
keep
in
corners
most
remote
there
sure
was
giles
to
come
also
sighing
amain
and
with
brow
of
heavy
portent
who
so
oft
as
he
met
beltane
gloomy
eye
would
shake
his
head
in
sad
yet
knowing
fashion
thus
as
evening
fell
beltane
finding
him
at
his
elbow
yet
despondent
betook
him
to
speech
at
last
quoth
he
giles
art
thou
sick
aye
lord
by
reason
of
this
fellow
in
the
blue
camlet
what
fellow
the
tall
and
buxom
fellow
in
the
reeve
garden
ha
quoth
beltane
frowning
in
the
garden
say
you
what
manner
of
man
is
this
o
brother
a
shapely
man
a
comely
man
a
man
of
words
and
cunning
phrases
a
man
shall
sing
you
sweet
and
melodious
as
any
bird
why
i
myself
can
sing
no
sweeter
cometh
he
there
often
giles
why
lord
he
cometh
and
he
goeth
i
saw
him
there
this
morning
what
doeth
he
there
nay
who
shall
say
genevra
is
wondrous
fair
yet
so
is
she
that
is
genevra
friend
so
do
i
hope
belike
is
she
hold
thy
peace
giles
now
beholding
beltane
fierce
eye
and
how
his
strong
hands
clenched
themselves
giles
incontinent
moved
further
off
and
spake
in
accents
soft
and
soothing
and
yet
tall
brother
and
yet
is
belike
but
some
gentle
troubadour
that
singeth
songs
to
their
delectation
and
is
meet
to
hark
to
songs
at
moonrise
lord
and
wherefore
at
moonrise
is
at
this
sweet
hour

and
there
is
a
moon
hereupon
beltane
must
needs
turn
to
scowl
upon
the
moon
just
topping
the
distant
woods
now
as
they
sat
thus
cometh
roger
with
bread
and
meat
for
his
lord
acceptance
but
beltane
setting
it
aside
stared
on
roger
with
baleful
eye
roger
said
he
wherefore
hast
avoided
me
this
day
avoided
thee
master
i
and
what
did

this
morning
in
the
reeve
garden

joy
to

the
sick
and

will
seek

there
myself
at
moonrise

questioned

said
beltane
grimly
at
moonrise
and
scowling
he
turned
away
aha
quoth
giles
nudging
roger
with
roguish
elbow
it
worketh
roger
it
worketh
aye
giles
it
worketh
so
well
that
an
my
master

his
hands
on
this
singing
fellow
then
woe
betide
this
singing
fellow
say
i
chapter
lxvii
telleth
what
befell
in
the
reeve
garden
the
moon
was
already
filling
the
night
with
her
soft
splendour
when
beltane
coming
to
a
certain
wall
swung
himself
up
and
being
there
paused
to
breathe
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
flowers
whose
languorous
fragrance
wrought
in
him
a
yearning
deep
and
passionate
and
ever
as
grew
bitterness
and
anger
were
forgot
very
still
was
it
within
this
sheltered
garden
where
fraught
by
the
moon
soft
magic
all
things
did
seem
to
find
them
added
beauties
but
even
as
he
paused
thus
he
heard
a
step
approaching
a
tread
quick
and
light
yet
assured
and
he
beheld
one
shrouded
in
a
long
cloak
of
blue
a
tall
figure
that
hasted
through
the
garden
and
vanished
behind
the
tall
yew
hedge
down
sprang
beltane
trampling
the
tender
flowers
under
cruel
feet
and
as
he
in
turn
passed
behind
the
hedge
the
moon
glittered
evilly
on
his
dagger
blade
quick
and
soft
of
foot
went
he
until
beholding
a
faint
light
amid
the
leaves
he
paused
then
hasted
on
and
thus
came
to
an
arbour
bowered
in
eglantine
she
sat
at
a
table
where
burned
a
rushlight
that
glowed
among
the
splendour
of
her
hair
for
her
head
was
bowed
above
the
letter
she
was
writing
now
as
he
stood
regarding
her
frowning
brows
she
spake
yet
lifted
not
her
shapely
head
well
my
lord
helen
where
is
he
that
came
here
but
now
slowly
she
lifted
her
head
and
setting
white
hands
dimpled
chin
met
his
frown
with
eyes
of
gentleness
nay
first
put
up
thy
dagger
my
lord
helen
said
he
again
whom
dost
wait
for
nay
first
put
up
thy
dagger
messire
frowning
he
obeyed
and
came
a
pace
nearer
what
do
you
here
with
pen
and
my
lord
i
write
to
whom
to
such
as
it
pleaseth
me
i
pray
you
show
me
nay
for
that
doth
not
please
me
messire
i
pray
you
who
was
he
that
came
hither
but
now
a
tall
man
in
a
long
blue
cloak
i
saw
him
not
my
lord
so
needs
must
i
see
thy
letter
nay
that
thou
shalt
not
my
lord
said
she
and
rose
to
her
stately
height
aye
but
i
shall
quoth
beltane
softly
and
came
a
pace
yet
nearer
now
because
of
the
grim
and
masterful
look
of
him
her
heart
fell
yet
she
fronted
him
and
curled
her
red
lip
at
him
messire
said
she
methinks
you
do
forget
i
am
the
i
remember
thou
art
woman
and
thy
name
helen
now
at
this
laughed
she
softly
and
thereafter
falleth
to
singing
very
sweet
and
blithe
and
merry
withal
the
letter
said
he
give
me
thy
letter
hereupon
she
took
up
the
letter
and
yet
singing
crumpled
it
up
within
white
fingers
then
beltane
set
by
the
table
and
reaching
out
sudden
arms
caught
her
up
waist
and
knee
and
lifting
her
high
crushed
her
upon
his
breast
helen
said
he
and
fierce
mine
art
thou
as
i
am
thine
forever
was
so
we
plighted
our
troth
within
the
green
now
for
thy
beauty
i
do
greatly
love
thee
but
for
thy
sweet
soul
and
purity
of
heart
i
do
reverence
and
worship
thee
but
an
thou
slay
my
reverent
worship
then
this
night
shalt
thou
die
and
i
with
thee
for
mine
art
thou
and
shalt
be
mine
forever
give
me
thy
letter
but
now
her
eyes
quailed
his
her
white
lids
drooped
and
sighing
she
spake
o
my
lord
thine
arms
are
so
so
tyrannous
that
i
do
fear
thee
almost
and
how
may
a
poor
maid
so
crushed
and
helpless
thus
gainsay
thee
so
prithee
o
prithee
take
my
poor
letter
an
thou
wilt
ravish
it
from
one
so
defenceless
o
beseech
thee
take
it
so
she
gave
the
crumpled
parchment
into
his
hand
yet
while
he
read
it
nestled
closer
in
his
arms
and
hid
her
face
against
him
for
what
he
read
was
this
beloved
art
thou
angered
or
sorrowful
or
humble
in
thy
foolish
jealousy
if
angered
then
must
i
woo
thee
if
sorrowful
cherish
thee
but
being
beltane
needs
must
i
love
thee
ever
so
write
i
this
bidding
thee
come
my
beltane
the
smith
for
i
the
crumpled
letter
fell
to
the
ground
helen
he
whispered
beloved
i
am
all
of
this
so
do
i
need
thy
comfort
thy
cherishing
and
all
thy
dear
love
turn
thy
head
o
helen
how
red
is
thy
sweet
mouth
then
stooped
he
and
so
they
kissed
each
other
such
kisses
as
they
had
known
until
she
sighed
and
trembled
and
lay
all
breathless
in
his
arms
o
my
lord
she
whispered
have
mercy
i
pray
dear
beltane
loose
me
for
i
i
have
much
to
tell
thee
and
because
of
her
pleading
eyes
he
loosed
her
and
she
sinking
upon
the
bench
leaned
there
all
flushed
and
tremulous
and
looking
on
him
sighed
and
sighing
put
up
her
hands
and
hid
her
face
from
his
regard
beltane
she
whispered
how
wondrous
a
thing
is
this
our
love
so
great
and
fierce
it
frighteth
me
see
how
i
tremble
and
she
held
out
to
him
her
hands
then
came
he
and
knelt
before
her
and
kissed
those
slender
fingers
amain
dear
hands
of
fidelis
said
he
but
for
their
tender
skill
and
gentle
care
i
had
not
lived
to
know
this
night
o
brave
small
hands
of
fidelis
poor
fidelis
she
sighed
but
indeed
it
wrung
my
heart
to
see
thy
woeful
face
when
i
did
tell
thee
fidelis
was
lost
to
thee
nay
beltane
stay
o
prithee
let
me
speak
quoth
beltane
his
kisses
wherefore
wert
so
cold
and
strange
to
me
but
yesterday
dear
my
heart
she
murmured
i
needs
must
make
thee
suffer
a
little
just
a
very
little
for
that
i
had
known
so
much
of
pain
and
heartache
because
of
thee
but
i
was
glad
to
see
thee
bear
the
wallet
of
poor
fidelis
and
o
was
foolish
in
thee
to
grieve
for
him
for
he
being
gone
thy
helen
doth
remain
unless
forsooth
thou
had
rather
i
came
to
thee
bedight
again
in
steel
that
did
so
chafe
me
beltane
indeed
my
tender
skin
did
suffer
much
on
thy
account
then
soon
with
my
kisses
will
i
seek
but
a
cool
soft
hand
schooled
his
hot
lips
to
silence
and
the
while
he
kissed
those
sweet
arresting
fingers
she
spake
smiling
lips
prithee
where
is
my
shoe
that
was
genevra
indeed
was
hard
matter
to
slip
it
off
for
thee
beltane
for
genevra
foot
is
something
smaller
than
mine
a
very
little
nay
crush
me
not

world
doth
hold
but
thee
and

my
beltane
as
when
sick
of
thy
wound
within
the
little
cave
i
nursed
thee
all
unknown
o

all
thy
sickness

was
with
thee
to

to
gentle
sleep
that
i
might
hold
thee
to
me
in
the
dark
and
kiss
thy
sleeping
lips
ah
he
sighed
and
methought
was
but
a
dream
o
helen
sure

and
thou
art
truly

would

of
a
sudden
his
mighty
arms
were
close
about
her
and
rising
he
lifted
her
upon
his
breast
what

with
me

night

very
hour

verily
said
beltane
as
god
sees
me
i
will
why
then
she
sighed
how
may
i
gainsay
thee
and
she
hid
her
face
against
him
once
more
but
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
arbour
she
stayed
him
i
prithee
now
whither
dost
take
me
beltane
to
the
minster
anywhere
so
that
i
find
good
friar
martin
nay
prithee
beltane
prithee
set
me
down
what
my
helen
loose
me
and
shalt
see
so
beltane
sighing
let
her
go
whereupon
she
took
a
small
silver
whistle
that
hung
at
her
girdle
and
sounded
it
ah
what
do
you
he
questioned
wait
said
she
and
in
a
while
came
the
sound
of
steps
from
the
outer
garden
and
looking
thither
beltane
beheld
a
tall
man
in
cloak
of
blue
camlet
and
when
this
man
drew
near
behold
it
was
giles
giles
quoth
he
thou
wily
rogue
giles
spake
the
duchess
softly
i
pray
you
let
them
come
then
giles
bowed
him
low
and
smiling
hasted
joyously
away
beltane
dear
my
lord
said
the
duchess
a
little
breathlessly
because
thou
art
true
man
and
thy
love
is
a
noble
love
i
did
lure
thee
hither
that
i
might
give
myself
to
thee
in
god
holy
sight
an
so
it
be
thy
will
my
lord
o
beltane
yonder
giles
and
roger
do
bring
friar
martin
to
make
me
thy
wife
wherefore
i
do
grow
something
fearful
is
foolish
in
me
to
fear
thee
and
yet
i
do
a
little
beltane
so
saying
she
looked
on
him
with
eyes
full
sweet
and
troubled
wherefore
he
would
have
kissed
her
but
steps
drew
nigh
and
lo
without
the
arbour
stood
the
white
friar
with
giles
and
roger
in
the
shadows
behind
now
came
beltane
and
took
the
friar
hand
holy
father
said
he
o
good
friar
martin
though
i
am
but
what
i
am
yet
hath
this
sweet
and
noble
lady
raised
me
up
to
be
what
i
have
dreamed
to
be
into
my
care
she
giveth
her
sweet
body
and
fair
fame
of
which
god
make
me
worthy
sweet
children
spake
the
friar
this
world
is
a
hard
and
cruel
world
but
god
is
a
gentle
god
and
merciful
wherefore
as
he
hath
given
to
man
the
blessed
sun
and
the
sweet
and
tender
flowers
so
hath
he
given
him
love
and
when
two
there
be
who
love
with
soul
as
well
as
body
with
mind
as
well
as
heart
then
methinks
for
them
this
world
may
be
a
paradise
and
my
children
because
i
do
love
thee
for
thy
sweet
lives
and
noble
works
so
do
i
joy
now
to
bind
ye
one
to
another
then
hand
in
hand
the
duchess
and
my
beltane
knelt
together
and
because
he
had
no
ring
needs
must
she
give
to
him
one
of
hers
so
were
they
as
one
that
dreamed
beltane
knelt
there
murmuring
the
responses
and
thus
knelt
he
so
long
that
he
started
to
feel
a
soft
touch
upon
his
cheek
and
looking
up
behold
they
were
alone
dost
dream
my
lord
she
questioned
aye
verily
he
answered
of
the
wonder
of
our
love
and
thee
beloved
as
i
did
see
thee
first
within
the
thicket
at
mortain
beautiful
as
now
though
then
was
thy
glorious
hair
unbound
i
dream
of
thine
eyes
beneath
thy
nun
veil
when
i
did
bear
thee
in
my
arms
from
thornaby
but
most
do
i
dream
of
thee
as
fidelis
and
the
clasp
of
thy
dear
arms
within
the
dark
but
thou
didst
leave
me
in
mortain
thicket
despite
my
hair
beltane
and
thou
didst
tell
me
mine
eyes
were
not
a
nun
eyes
beltane
wherefore
this
night
do
i
thank
god
said
he
drawing
her
close
beside
him
on
the
bench
and
for
my
arms
beltane
thou
didst
think
them
man
arms
because
they
went
bedight
in
mail
forsooth
so
this
night
shall
they
go
bedight
in
kisses
of
my
mouth
loose
me
this
sleeve
i
pray
nay
beltane
i
do
beseech
thee
art
not
my
wife
aye
my
lord
then
loose
me
thy
sleeve
helen
so
blushing
trembling
needs
must
she
obey
and
yield
her
soft
arms
to
his
caresses
and
hide
her
face
because
of
their
round
white
nakedness
but
in
a
while
she
spake
low
and
very
humble
dear
my
lord
the
moon
doth
set
already
methinks
aye
but
there
is
no
cloud
to
dim
her
glory
helen
but
the
hour
waxeth
very
late
my
lord
and
i
must
away
aye
beloved
let
us
go
nay
my
lord
i
o
dear
beltane
wife
said
he
dear
my
love
and
wife
have
i
not
waited
long
enough
hand
in
hand
they
walked
amid
the
flowers
with
eyes
only
for
each
other
until
came
they
to
a
stair
and
up
the
stair
to
a
chamber
rich
with
silk
and
arras
and
sweet
with
spicy
odours
a
chamber
by
a
silver
lamp
pendent
from
carven
whose
soft
glow
filled
the
place
with
shadow
yet
even
in
this
tender
dimness
or
because
of
it
her
colour
ebbed
and
flowed
her
breath
came
apace
and
she
stood
before
him
voiceless
and
very
still
save
for
the
sweet
tumult
of
her
bosom
then
beltane
loosed
off
his
sword
and
laid
it
upon
the
silken
couch
but
perceiving
how
she
trembled
he
set
his
arm
about
her
and
drew
her
to
the
open
lattice
where
the
moon
made
a
pool
of
glory
at
their
feet
dost
fear
me
helen
nay
my
lord
i
think
not
then
wherefore
dost
tremble
ah
beltane
thou
methinks
dost
tremble
also
then
beltane
knelt
him
at
her
feet
and
looked
upon
her
loveliness
with
yearning
eyes
yet
touched
her
not
o
beloved
maid
said
he
this
is
methinks
because
of
thy
sweet
virgin
eyes
for
i
do
so
love
thee
helen
that
an
it
be
thy
will
now
will
i
leave
thee
until
thy
heart
doth
call
me
now
stooped
she
and
set
her
white
arms
about
him
and
her
soft
cheek
to
his
hot
brow
dear
my
lord
and
husband
she
whispered
is
for
this
so
sweet
tenderness
in
thee
that
i
do
love
thee
best
methinks
and
fear
me
no
more
aye
my
lord
i
do
fear
thee
when
when
thou
dost
look
on
me
so
but
when
thou
dost
look
on
me
so
is
then
i
do
love
thee
most
my
beltane
up
to
his
feet
sprang
beltane
and
caught
her
to
him
breast
to
breast
and
lip
to
lip
the
great
sword
clattered
to
the
floor
but
now
even
as
she
sank
in
his
embrace
she
held
him
off
to
stare
with
eyes
of
sudden
terror
as
upon
the
stilly
night
broke
a
thunderous
rumble
a
shock
and
thereafter
sudden
roar
and
outcry
from
afar
that
swelled
to
a
wild
hubbub
of
distant
voices
and
cries
lost
all
at
once
in
the
raving
clamour
of
the
tocsin
locked
thus
within
each
other
arms
eye
questioned
eye
while
ever
the
bell
beat
out
its
fierce
alarm
and
presently
within
the
garden
below
was
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
coming
to
the
casement
beltane
beheld
a
light
that
hovered
to
and
fro
growing
ever
nearer
and
brighter
until
he
saw
that
he
who
bore
it
was
black
roger
and
face
shone
with
sweat
and
his
breath
laboured
with
his
running
master
he
panted
o
master
a
mine
a
mine
they
have
breached
the
wall
beside
the
gate
hark
where
they
storm
the
city
come
master
o
come
ere
it
be
too
late
now
beltane
clenched
his
fists
and
scowled
on
roger
and
from
him
to
the
radiant
sky
yet
when
he
spake
his
voice
was
low
and
even
i
thank
thee
faithful
roger
go
you
and
summon
such
of
our
foresters
as
ye
may
muster
them
in
the
there
will
i
come
to
thee
now
when
roger
flickering
light
had
vanished
he
turned
and
found
helen
close
beside
him
her
cheeks
were
pale
but
in
her
hand
she
held
his
sword
is
well
thou
wert
not
all
unarmed
my
lord
she
sighed
and
forthwith
belted
the
weapon
about
him
kneel
down
i
prithee
that
i
may
lace
for
thee
thy
hood
of
mail
and
when
it
was
done
she
knelt
also
and
taking
his
hand
pressed
it
to
her
throbbing
heart
and
holding
him
thus
fell
to
prayer
o
god
of
mercy
have
in
care
those
that
fight
in
our
defence
this
night
in
especial
guard
and
shield
this
man
of
mine
that
i
do
love
beyond
all
men
o
god
of
mercy
hear
us
so
they
arose
and
as
he
looked
on
her
so
looked
she
on
him
and
of
a
sudden
clasped
him
in
close
and
passionate
embrace
beltane
beltane
she
sobbed
god
knoweth
i
do
so
love
thee
that
thy
dear
flesh
is
mine
methinks
and
the
steel
that
woundeth
thee
shall
hurt
me
also
and
o
love
an
thou
die
then
surely
will
this
heart
of
mine
die
with
thee
no
man
shall
have
my
love
other
than
thou
so
to
my
grave
will
i
go
thy
virgin
wife
for
thy
dear
sake
fare
thee
well
beltane
o
dear
my
husband
fare
thee
well
tarry
no
longer
lest
i
pray
thee
on
my
knees
to
go
not
to
the
battle
so
beltane
kissed
her
once
and
went
forth
of
the
chamber
looking
not
back
she
heard
the
ring
of
his
armour
the
stair
the
quick
tread
of
his
feet
and
leaning
from
the
casement
watched
him
go
and
he
knowing
her
there
looked
not
up
but
with
teeth
hard
shut
and
iron
hands
clenched
strode
fast
upon
his
way
and
now
since
he
looked
not
up
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
out
of
his
thoughts
already
for
his
face
was
stern
and
set
and
in
his
eyes
was
the
fierce
light
of
battle
and
she
kneeling
alone
in
the
failing
glory
of
the
moon
hid
her
face
within
yearning
desolate
arms
and
wept
long
and
bitterly
chapter
lxviii
friar
martin
dying
prophecy
now
as
beltane
hasted
along
he
heard
the
tread
of
mailed
feet
and
looking
round
beheld
the
white
friar
and
his
white
frock
mail
gleamed
while
in
his
hand
he
grasped
a
heavy
sword
close
on
his
heels
came
many
men
old
men
these
for
the
most
part
grey
of
beard
and
white
of
head
and
their
armour
even
as
they
was
ancient
and
rusty
but
the
faces
that
stared
from
casque
and
were
grim
and
stern
faces
and
purposeful
and
the
eyes
that
gleamed
shaggy
brows
ere
now
had
looked
on
sons
and
brothers
done
to
death
by
fire
and
gallows
and
wives
and
daughters
shamed
and
ravished
and
ever
as
they
came
friar
martin
smote
sword
in
hand
on
door
and
shuttered
window
and
cried
hoarse
and
loud
ye
men
of
belsaye
fathers
and
husbands
arm
ye
arm
ye
ye
greybeards
that
have
seen
duke
ivo
mercy
arm
ye
your
foes
be
in
to
burn
to
loot
again
and
ravish
o
ye
husbands
and
fathers
arise
arise
arm
arm
and
follow
me
to
smite
for
wife
and
children
so
cried
the
tall
white
friar
pallid
of
cheek
but
dauntless
of
eye
and
ever
as
he
cried
smote
he
upon
door
and
shutter
with
his
sword
and
ever
his
company
grew
within
the
square
was
roger
with
beltane
battered
on
a
pike
whereto
the
foresters
mustered
hardy
and
men
fitting
on
bascinet
and
buckling
belt
yet
very
quiet
and
orderly
and
beside
roger
ulf
the
mighty
leaned
him
upon
his
axe
and
in
the
ranks
despite
their
bandages
stood
orson
the
tall
and
jenkyn
the
ford
even
yet
in
wordy
disputation
quoth
beltane
how
many
muster
ye
roger
one
hundred
and
nine
master
and
where
is
walkyn
where
giles
with
sir
benedict
hard
by
the
gate
master
my
lord
come
take
thy
helm

be
a
close
and
bitter
fight
and
thou
art
no
longer
thine
own
man
bethink
thee
of
thy
sweet
wife
sir
fidelis
master
so
beltane
did
on
the
great
casque
and
even
now
came
sir
brian
beside
whom
sir
hacon
limped
yet
with
sword
bloody
ha
my
lord
he
cried
mine
eyes
do
joy
to
see
thee
and
these
goodly
fellows
is
hard
and
fierce
business
where
benedict
and
his
pikes
do
hold
the
gate
aye
forsooth
quoth
sir
brian
they
press
their
attack
amain
for
one
that
falleth
two
do
fill
his
place
verily
and
what
fighting
man
could
ask
more
of
any
foe
and
we
be
fighting
men
praise
be
to
saint
cuthbert
aye
quoth
roger
crossing
himself
saint
cuthbert
be
our
aid
this
night
forthwith
beltane
formed
his
column
and
with
ulf
and
roger
beside
him
marched
from
the
square
by
narrow
streets
went
they
casements
where
pale
faces
looked
down
to
pray
heaven
aid
on
them
so
came
they
where
torch
and
lanthorn
smoked
and
gleamed
by
whose
fitful
light
they
beheld
a
barricade
rough
and
hastily
contrived
whence
sir
benedict
fought
and
walkyn
smote
with
divers
of
their
stout
company
and
lusty
fellows
from
the
town
above
upon
the
great
flanking
tower
of
the
gate
was
giles
with
many
archers
who
plied
their
whizzing
shafts
amain
where
outer
and
inner
wall
the
assailants
sought
to
storm
the
barricade
but
the
place
was
narrow
and
moreover
beyond
the
breach
stout
eric
backed
by
his
fierce
townsmen
fought
in
desperate
battle
thus
though
the
besiegers
ranks
were
constantly
swelled
by
way
of
the
breach
yet
in
that
confined
space
their
very
numbers
hampered
them
while
from
sheltered
wall
and
giles
and
his
archers
showered
them
with
whistling
shafts
very
fast
and
furious
so
in
that
narrow
place
death
was
rife
and
in
the
fitful
was
a
sea
of
tossing
steel
and
faces
fierce
and
wild
and
ever
the
clamour
grew
shouts
and
screams
and
cries
dreadful
to
be
heard
now
as
beltane
stood
to
watch
this
for
it
needed
but
few
to
man
the
barricade
so
narrow
was
it
roger
caught
his
arm
and
pointed
to
the
housetops
above
them
and
what
he
saw
others
saw
also
and
a
cry
went
up
of
wonder
and
amaze
for
high
upon
the
roof
his
mail
agleam
his
white
robe
whiter
in
the
stood
friar
martin
while
crouched
behind
him
to
left
and
right
were
many
men
in
ancient
and
rusty
armour
men
and
white
of
head
at
sight
of
whom
the
roar
of
battle
died
down
from
sheer
amaze
until
all
men
might
hear
the
friar
words
come
ye
men
of
belsaye
he
cried
all
ye
that
do
love
wife
or
daughter
or
little
child
all
ye
that
would
maintain
them
innocent
and
pure
follow
me
as
he
ended
his
sword
flashed
and
even
as
he
sprang
so
sprang
all
those
behind
him
down
down
they
leapt
upon
the
foemen
below
so
swift
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
ere
they
could
be
met
with
pike
or
sword
the
thing
was
done
and
now
from
that
narrow
way
by
lanthorn
and
there
rose
a
sound
more
awful
to
hear
than
roar
of
battle
a
hoarse
and
vicious
sound
like
to
the
worrying
snarl
of
many
great
and
fierce
hounds
with
ancient
swords
with
axe
and
dagger
and
teeth
they
fought
those
fathers
of
belsaye
thick
and
fast
they
fell
yet
never
alone
while
ever
they
raved
on
a
company
of
madmen
behind
the
friar
white
robe
back
and
back
the
besiegers
reeled
before
that
raging
fury
twice
the
white
friar
was
smitten
down
yet
twice
he
arose
smiting
the
fiercer
wherefore
because
of
his
religious
habit
the
deathly
pallor
of
his
sunken
cheek
and
the
glare
of
his
eyes
panic
came
and
all
men
shrank
from
the
red
sweep
of
his
sword
then
sir
benedict
sounded
his
horn
and
sword
in
hand
leapt
over
the
barricade
and
behind
him
beltane
with
roger
and
ulf
and
walkyn
and
their
serried
pikemen
while
sir
brian
and
sir
hacon
limped
in
their
rear
the
breach
cried
sir
benedict
seize
we
now
the
breach
the
breach
the
breach
roared
a
hundred
voices
and
now
within
the
gloom
steel
rasped
steel
groping
hands
seized
and
griped
with
merciless
fingers
figures
sank
smitten
groaning
beneath
the
press
but
on
they
fought
slipping
and
stumbling
hewing
and
thrusting
up
and
up
over
ruined
masonry
over
forms
that
groaned
beneath
cruel
feet
on
and
ever
on
until
within
the
narrow
breach
beltane
long
sword
darted
and
thrust
and
ulf
axe
whirled
and
fell
while
hard
by
walkyn
hoarse
shout
went
up
in
roaring
triumph
so
within
this
narrow
gap
where
shapeless
things
stirred
and
whimpered
in
the
dark
beltane
leaned
breathless
upon
his
sword
and
looked
down
upon
the
of
duke
ivo
great
camp
but
even
as
he
gazed
these
fires
were
blotted
out
where
dark
figures
mounted
fresh
to
the
assault
and
once
again
sword
and
axes
fell
to
their
dire
work
and
ever
as
he
fought
beltane
bethought
him
of
her
whose
pure
lips
voiced
prayers
for
him
and
his
mighty
arm
grew
mightier
yet
and
he
smote
and
thrust
untiring
while
walkyn
raged
upon
his
left
roaring
amain
for
red
pertolepe
and
ulf
the
strong
saved
his
breath
to
ply
his
axe
the
faster
now
presently
as
they
fought
thus
because
the
breach
was
grown
very
slippery
beltane
tripped
and
fell
but
in
that
instant
two
lusty
mailed
legs
bestrode
him
and
from
the
dimness
above
roger
voice
hailed
get
thee
back
master
i
pray
thee
get
back
and
take
thy
rest
awhile
my
arm
is
fresh
and
my
steel
scarce
blooded
so
get
thee
to
thy
rest
moreover
thou
art
a
notch
lord
another
accursed
notch
from
my
belt
wherefore
beltane
presently
crept
down
from
the
breach
and
thus
beheld
many
men
who
laboured
amain
beneath
sir
benedict
watchful
eye
to
build
a
defence
work
very
high
and
strong
where
they
might
command
the
breach
and
as
beltane
sat
thus
finding
himself
very
spent
and
weary
cometh
giles
beside
him
lord
said
he
leaning
him
on
his
bow
the
attack
doth
languish
methinks
wherefore
i
do
praise
the
good
god
for
had
they
won
the
town
ah
when
i
do
think
on
her
she
that
is
so
pure
and
sweet
and
ivo
base
soldiery
o
sweet
jesu
and
giles
shivered
forsooth

belsaye
sacked

years
agone

once
did
show
me
a
goodly
chain

mind
me

aye
but
i
lost
it
i
lost
it
master
he
cried
eagerly
o
verily
i
did
lose
it
so
did
it
avail
me
nothing
moreover
giles
thou
didst
with
knowing
laugh
vaunt
that
the
women
of
belsaye
town
were
marvellous
fair
and
methinks
didst
speak
truly
giles
now
at
this
giles
bowed
his
head
and
turning
him
about
went
heavily
upon
his
way
then
sighing
beltane
arose
and
came
where
stood
sir
benedict
who
forthwith
hailed
him
blithely

but

them
until
the
dawn

to
the
growing
barricade
but

end
of
such
as
stormed
the
breach
but
who
cometh
here
and
by
this
hand
in
tears
already
in
the
east
was
a
roseate
glory
by
whose
soft
light
beltane
beheld
tall
orson
who
grasped
a
bloody
sword
in
one
hand
and
wiped
away
his
tears
with
the
other
he
perceiving
beltane
and
sir
benedict
limped
to
them
forthwith
and
spake
albeit
hoarse
and
brokenly

to

where

lieth
the
noblest
as

as
blessed

wi
his
poor
hand
as
do
be
so
faint
and
feeble
so
saying
orson
brought
them
to
a
house
beside
the
wall
wherein
upon
a
pallet
the
white
friar
lay
with
jenkyn
beside
him
and
the
reeve
and
many
other
of
the
sturdy
townsfolk
about
him
now
came
beltane
to
kneel
beside
the
friar
who
opening
swooning
eyes
smiled
and
spake
my
lord
beltane
noble
son
my
work
on
earth
is
ended
methinks
so
doth
god
call
me
hence
and
i
do
go
right
gladly
these
dying
eyes
grow
dim
but
with
the
deathless
eyes
of
the
soul
i
do
see
many
things
most
plainly
so
dear
and
valiant
children
hear

woes
of

from
the
north
and
this
i
give

sign
he
is
tall
this
man
bedight
in
sable
armour
and
mounted
upon
a
great
white
horse
and
behind
him
marcheth
a
mighty
following

woods

bright
with
the
gleam
of
armour

and
sorrows

done
even
as
mine
ah
list
list
ye
to
those
bells
hear
ye
not
their
joyful
clamour
hearken
but
indeed
silence
had
fallen
upon
belsaye
and
no
sound
brake
the
quiet
save
the
distant
hum
and
stir
of
conflict
upon
the
broken
wall
nevertheless
the
friar
dying
face
waxed
bright
with
a
wondrous
happiness
o
blessed
blessed
sound
he
whispered
of
a
sudden
he
rose
up
from
his
pillow
with
radiant
eyes
uplifted
and
stretched
up
arms
in
eager
welcome
sweet
jesu
he
whispered
slowly
his
arms
sank
the
thin
hands
strove
to
fold
themselves
fell
apart
and
sighing
rapturously
friar
martin
sank
back
upon
his
pillows
like
one
that
is
weary
and
with
the
sigh
was
dead
and
lo
in
that
same
moment
from
tower
and
belfry
near
and
far
rose
a
sudden
wild
and
gladsome
clamour
of
bells
ringing
out
peal
on
peal
of
rapturous
joy
insomuch
that
those
who
knelt
beside
that
couch
of
death
lifted
bowed
heads
eye
questioning
eye
in
a
wonder
beyond
words
and
now
all
at
once
was
the
ring
and
tramp
of
mailed
feet
coming
swiftly
and
in
the
doorway
stood
roger
his
riven
mail
befouled
with
battle
lords
he
panted
rejoice
rejoice
our
woes
and
sorrows
be
past
and
done
hark
ye
to
the
bells
our
deliverance
cometh
from
the
north
you
shall
see
the
woods
alight
with
the
gleam
of
their
armour
nothing
saying
beltane
arose
and
went
from
the
chamber
past
the
blood
and
horror
of
the
breach
and
climbing
the
flanking
tower
beside
the
gate
looked
to
the
north
and
there
he
beheld
a
mighty
company
that
marched
forth
of
the
woods
rank
upon
rank
whose
armour
flashing
in
the
early
sun
made
a
dazzling
splendour
against
the
green
company
by
company
they
mustered
on
the
plain
knights
and
with
footmen
and
archers
beyond
count
and
presently
before
this
deep
array
two
standards
were
advanced
a
white
banner
whereon
was
a
red
lion
and
a
banner
on
whose
blue
ground
black
leopards
were
enwrought
now
as
beltane
gazed
upon
this
glorious
host
he
felt
a
gentle
hand
touch
him
and
turning
beheld
the
duchess
helen
and
her
cheek
showed
pale
with
her
long
night
vigil
my
beltane
said
she
flushing
his
regard
lord
duke
of
mortain
behold
yonder
thy
goodly
powers
of
mortain
that
shall
do
thy
bidding
henceforth
look
yonder
my
lord
duke
duke
quoth
beltane
duke
of
mortain
forsooth
and
am
i
so
indeed
i
had
forgot
this
quite
in
thy
beauty
my
helen
and
did
but
know
that
i
had
to
wife
one
that
i
do
love
beyond
all
created
things
and
now
beloved
thy
sweet
eyes
do
tell
me
thy
night
was
sleepless
mine
eyes
ah
look
not
on
them
beltane
for
well
i
know
these
poor
eyes
be
all
red
and
swollen
with
weeping
for
thee
though
indeed
i
bathed
them
ere
i
sought
thee
sweet
eyes
of
love
said
he
setting
his
arm
about
her
come
let
me
kiss
them
ah
no
beltane
look
yonder
behold
where
salvation
cometh
i
had
rather
look
where
my
salvation
lieth
within
these
dear
eyes
nay
abase
them
not
and
didst
weep
for
me
and
wake
for
me
my
helen
i
was
so
so
fearful
for
thee
my
lord
aye
and
what
more
and
very
sorrowful
aye
and
what
more
and
heartsick
aye
sweet
my
wife
but
what
more
and
very
lonely
beltane
then
my
beltane
caught
her
close
and
kissed
her
full
long
until
she
struggled
in
his
embrace
and
slipping
from
him
stood
all
flushed
and
breathless
and
but
of
a
sudden
she
caught
his
hand
and
pointed
where
before
the
glittering
ranks
of
mortain
chivalry
a
herald
advanced
look
beltane
she
said
oh
look
and
tell
me
who
rideth
yonder
now
behind
this
herald
two
knights
advanced
the
one
in
glittering
armour
whose
shield
was
resplendent
with
many
quarterings
but
beholding
his
companion
beltane
stared
in
wondering
awe
for
lo
he
saw
a
tall
man
bedight
in
sable
armour
who
bore
a
naked
sword
that
flashed
in
the
sun
and
who
bestrode
a
great
white
charger
and
because
of
friar
martin
dying
words
beltane
stood
awed
and
full
of
amaze
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
until
all
men
might
read
the
cognizance
upon
the
first
knight
resplendent
shield
and
know
him
for
one
sir
jocelyn
lord
of
alain
but
his
companion
they
knew
not
since
neither
charge
nor
blazon
bore
he
of
any
sort
of
a
sudden
the
herald
set
clarion
to
lip
and
blew
a
challenge
that
was
taken
up
and
answered
from
within
the
camp
and
forth
came
duke
ivo
in
his
armour
and
with
knights
attendant
who
silencing
the
heralds
with
a
gesture
spake
loud
and
fierce
sir
jocelyn
lord
of
alain
why
come
ye
against
me
in
arms
and
so
ungently
arrayed
wherefore
come
ye
in
such
force
and
for
what
then
answered
sir
jocelyn
my
lord
ivo
thou
wert
upon
a
time
our
honoured
guest
within
mortain
thou
didst
with
honeyed
word
and
tender
phrase
woo
our
fair
young
duchess
to
wife
but
and
heed
this
my
lord
when
helen
the
beautiful
the
proud
did
thy
will
gainsay
thou
didst
in
hearing
of
divers
of
her
lords
and
counsellors
vow
and
swear
to
come
one
day
and
seek
her
with
flaming
brands
so
here
stand
i
and
divers
other
gentles
of
mortain
in
especial
this
right
noble
lord
to
tell
thee
that
so
long
as
we
be
men
shalt
set
foot
across
our
marches
lastly
we
are
hither
come
to
demand
the
safe
conduct
from
belsaye
of
our
lady
duchess
helen
and
such
of
the
citizens
as
may
choose
to
follow
her
so
quoth
duke
ivo
smiling
and
fingering
his
long
blue
chin
is
war
ye
do
force
on
me
my
lord
of
alain
nay
messire
answered
sir
jocelyn
that
must
be
asked
of
this
sable
knight
for
he
is
greater
than
i
and
leadeth
where
i
do
but
follow
now
hereupon
the
black
knight
paced
slowly
forward
upon
his
great
white
horse
nor
stayed
until
he
came
close
beside
duke
ivo
then
reining
in
his
charger
he
lifted
his
vizor
and
spake
in
voice
deep
and
strong
o
thou
that
men
call
ivo
the
duke
look
upon
this
face
behold
these
white
hairs
this
lined
brow
bethink
thee
of
the
innocent
done
to
cruel
death
by
thy
will
the
fair
cities
given
to
ravishment
and
flame
and
judge
if
this
be
just
and
sufficient
cause
for
war
and
bitter
war
betwixt
us
now
beholding
the
face
of
the
speaker
his
proud
and
noble
bearing
his
bold
eyes
fierce
and
bright
and
the
grim
line
of
nose
and
chin
duke
ivo
blenched
and
drew
back
the
smile
fled
from
his
lip
and
he
stared
wide
of
eye
and
breathless
beltane
quoth
he
at
last
beltane
ha
methought
thee
dusty
bones
these
many
years
so
it
is
war
i
judge
for
answer
duke
beltane
lifted
on
high
the
long
sword
he
bore
ivo
said
he
the
cries
and
groans
of
my
sorrowful
and
distressed
people
have
waked
me
from
my
selfish
griefs
at
last
so
am
i
come
for
vengeance
on
their
innocent
blood
their
griefs
and
wrongs
so
long
endured
of
thee
this
do
i
swear
thee
that
this
steel
shall
go
unsheathed
until
i
meet
thee
in
mortal
combat
and
ere
this
sun
be
set
one
of
us
twain
shall
be
no
more
be
it
so
answered
black
ivo
this
night
belike
i
shall
hang
thee
above
the
ruins
of
belsaye
yonder
and
thy
son
with
thee
so
saying
he
turned
about
and
chin
on
fist
rode
into
his
camp
where
was
mounting
and
mustering
in
hot
haste
beltane
spake
the
duchess
clasping
beltane
hand
dost
know
at
last
aye
answered
he
with
eyes
aglow
but
how
cometh
my
noble
father
yonder
i
sought
him
out
in
holy
cross
thicket
beltane
i
told
him
of
thy
valiant
doings
and
of
thy
need
of
instant
aid
and
besought
him
to
take
up
arms
for
thee
and
for
me
and
for
dear
mortain
and
to
lead
my
army
but
beltane
falling
before
her
on
his
knee
spake
quick
and
passionate
o
helen
helen
the
beautiful
without
thee
i
had
been
nought
and
less
than
nought
without
thee
pentavalon
had
groaned
yet
cruel
wrong
without
thee
o
without
thee
my
helen
i
were
a
thing
lost
and
helpless
in
very
truth
now
hereupon
being
first
and
foremost
a
woman
young
and
loving
and
passionate
needs
must
she
weep
over
him
a
little
and
stoop
to
cherish
his
golden
head
on
her
bosom
and
holding
it
thus
sweetly
pillowed
to
kiss
him
full
oft
and
thereafter
loose
him
and
blush
and
sigh
and
turn
from
his
regard
all
sweet
and
shy
demureness
like
the
very
maid
she
was
whereat
beltane
forgetful
of
all
but
her
loveliness
heedful
of
nought
in
the
world
but
her
warm
young
beauty
rose
up
from
his
knees
and
with
love
would
have
caught
her
to
his
eager
arms
but
of
a
sudden
cometh
giles
breathless
hasting
up
the
narrow
stair
and
all
heedless
of
his
lord
runneth
to
fling
himself
upon
his
knees
before
the
duchess
to
catch
her
robe
and
kiss
it
oft
o
dear
and
gracious
lady
he
cried
genevra
hath
told
me
and
is
it
true
thou
hast
promised
me
a
place
within
thy
court
at
fair
mortain
is
it
true
thou
wilt
lift
me
up
that
i
may
wed
with
one
so
much
me
in
station
is
it
true
thou
wilt
give
me
my
genevra
my
heart
desire
all
unworthy
though
i
be
i
o
and
behold
giles
ready
tongue
faltered
for
very
gratitude
and
on
each
tanned
cheek
were
bright
tears
giles
said
she
thou
wert
true
and
faithful
to
my
lord
when
his
friends
were
few
so
methinks
thou
be
faithful
and
true
to
thy
sweet
genevra
so
will
i
make
thee
steward
and
bailiff
of
mortain
an
my
lord
is
in
accord
lord
quoth
giles
brokenly
ere
thou
dost
speak
beseech
thee
hear
this
i
have
thought
on
thy
saying
regarding
my
past
days
and
grieved
sorely
therefore
now
an
ye
do
think
my
shameful
past
beyond
redemption
if
these
arms
be
too
vile
to
clasp
her
as
my
wife
if
my
love
shall
bring
her
sorrow
or
shame
hereafter
then
because
i
do
truly
love
her
i
will
see
her
no
more
i
will
leave
her
to
love
one
more
worthy
than
i
and
this
i
do
swear
thee
master
on
the
cross
quoth
beltane
giles
he
that
knoweth
himself
unworthy
if
that
his
love
be
a
true
love
shall
by
that
love
make
himself
mayhap
worthier
than
most
he
that
loveth
so
greatly
that
in
his
love
base
self
is
forgot
such
a
man
methinks
doth
love
in
fashion
so
shall
it
be
as
my
lady
hath
said
then
giles
arose
and
wiping
off
his
tears
strove
to
speak
his
thanks
but
choked
upon
a
sob
instead
and
turning
hasted
down
the
turret
stair
now
presently
within
the
city
sir
benedict
trumpets
hew
and
looking
from
the
battlement
beltane
beheld
sir
hacon
mustering
their
stout
company
knights
and
what
time
roger
and
walkyn
and
ulf
ordered
what
remained
of
their
pikemen
and
archers
beloved
sighed
beltane
drawing
his
duchess
within
his
arm
see
yonder
is
horse
and
saddle
soon
must
i
leave
thee
again
now
did
she
sigh
amain
and
cling
to
him
and
droop
her
lovely
head
yet
when
she
spake
her
words
were
brave
my
beltane
this
love
of
mine
is
such
that
i
would
not
have
thee
fail
in
duty
though
this
my
heart
should
break
but
ah
husband
stay
yet
a
little
longer
i
i
have
been
a
something
lonely
wife
hitherto
and
i
do
hate
loneliness
beltane
a
mailed
foot
sounded
upon
the
stone
stair
and
turning
about
they
beheld
a
knight
in
resplendent
armour
blazoned
shield
slung
before
greeting
to
thee
my
lord
duke
of
mortain
and
to
thy
lovely
lady
wife
spake
a
cheery
voice
and
the
speaker
lifting
his
vizor
behold
it
was
sir
benedict
i
go
in
mine
own
armour
beltane
that
haply
thy
noble
father
shall
know
me
in
the
press
ha
see
where
he
ordereth
his
line
was
ever
so
his
custom
i
mind
me
in
four
columns
with
archers
betwixt
mark
me
now
lad
i
have
brought
thee
here
a
helm
graced
with
these
foolish
feathers
as
is
the
new
fashion
white
feathers
see
you
that
my
lady
sweet
eyes
may
follow
thee
in
the
affray
for
that
dear
benedict
cried
she
for
that
shalt
kiss
me
so
off
with
thy
great
helm
forthwith
sir
benedict
did
off
his
casque
and
stooping
kissed
her
and
meeting
beltane
eye
flushed
and
laughed
and
was
solemn
all
in
a
moment
ah
beltane
dear
lad
quoth
he
i
envy
thee
and
grieve
for
thee
to
possess
such
a
maid
to
wife
and
to
leave
her
so
soon
may
god
bring
thee
safe
again
to
her
white
arms
ah
youth
is
very
sweet
lad
and
love
true
love
is
youth
fair
paradise
and
body
o
me
there
sound
our
tuckets
see
where
ivo
formeth
his
main
battle
and
yonder
he
posteth
a
goodly
company
to
shut
us
up
within
the
city
so
must
we
wait
a
while
until
the
battle
joins
thy
noble
father
is
wondrous
wise
in
war
o
verily
he
hath
seen
behold
how
he
altereth
his
array
o
wise
beltane
now
duke
ivo
threw
out
a
screen
of
archers
and
horsemen
to
harass
the
powers
of
mortain
what
time
he
formed
his
battle
in
three
great
companies
a
deep
and
formidable
array
of
knights
and
whose
tall
lances
rose
a
very
forest
with
pennons
and
banderols
in
the
gentle
wind
of
morning
far
on
the
left
showed
the
banner
of
his
marshal
sir
bors
above
his
right
battle
flew
the
raven
banner
of
sir
pertolepe
the
red
and
above
his
main
battle
rose
his
own
standard
a
black
lion
on
a
red
field
so
mustered
he
his
powers
of
pentavalon
gay
with
stir
of
pennons
and
rich
trappings
the
sun
flashed
back
from
ponderous
casques
and
bascinets
innumerable
and
flamed
on
blazoned
shields
and
beholding
their
might
and
confident
bearing
beltane
clenched
nervous
hands
and
his
mouth
grew
hard
and
grim
so
turned
he
from
this
formidable
host
to
where
just
beyond
the
woods
his
banner
flew
beside
the
leopards
of
mortain
conspicuous
upon
his
white
charger
he
beheld
duke
beltane
a
proud
and
warlike
figure
who
sat
his
stamping
deep
in
converse
with
sir
jocelyn
while
behind
were
the
dense
ranks
of
mortain
suddenly
sir
jocelyn
wheeled
his
charger
and
galloped
along
mortain
front
his
rich
armour
glittering
until
he
halted
at
the
head
of
that
knightly
company
posted
upon
the
left
meantime
black
ivo
archers
advancing
fell
into
arrow
formation
and
began
to
ply
the
mortain
ranks
with
clouds
of
shafts
and
bolts
which
divers
men
and
horses
fell
what
time
black
ivo
massed
columns
moved
slowly
forward
to
the
attack
yet
duke
beltane
sitting
among
his
knights
stirred
not
and
the
army
of
mortain
abode
very
silent
and
still
but
of
a
sudden
duke
beltane
wheeled
his
horse
his
sword
flashed
on
high
whereat
trumpets
brayed
and
on
the
instant
sir
jocelyn
wheeled
off
to
the
left
he
and
all
his
company
and
gathering
speed
began
to
skirt
duke
ivo
advanced
pikemen
and
archers
and
so
rode
down
upon
those
men
of
pentavalon
who
were
drawn
up
against
belsaye
hereupon
black
ivo
would
have
launched
a
to
check
sir
jocelyn
attack
but
his
advanced
lines
of
and
archers
hampered
him
once
again
duke
beltane
sword
flashed
up
the
first
line
of
mortain
great
array
leapt
forward
and
with
levelled
lances
thundered
down
upon
black
ivo
ranks
scattering
and
trampling
down
his
archers
but
as
they
checked
before
the
serried
pikes
behind
forth
galloped
duke
beltane
second
line
and
after
this
a
third
ivo
pikemen
by
their
numbers
and
bursting
over
and
through
their
torn
ranks
reformed
and
spurring
hard
met
ivo
rank
with
crashing
shock
in
full
career
and
behind
this
raging
battle
duke
beltane
rode
at
the
head
of
his
reserves
and
watchful
what
time
sir
jocelyn
was
hotly
engaged
upon
the
left
nigh
unto
the
town
itself
ah
beltane
sighed
the
duchess
shivering
and
covering
her
face
is
horrible
horrible
see
how
they
fall
nay
my
brave
fidelis
heed
rather
how
valiant
sir
jocelyn
and
his
knights
drive
in
their
advanced
lines
ha
benedict
see
how
he
breaks
their
array
an
he
can
but
turn
their
flank
nay
beltane
yonder
cometh
the
raven
banner
where
pertolepe
spurreth
in
support
aye
but
yonder
doth
my
father
launch
yet
another
charge
ha
benedict
let
us
out
and
aid
them
the
way
lieth
open
beyond
the
drawbridge
an
we
can
but
turn
ivo
flank
quoth
beltane
looking
ever
upon
the
battle
o
methinks
the
time
is
now
benedict
with
helen
soft
hand
in
his
beltane
hasted
down
from
the
tower
and
sir
benedict
followed
until
they
were
come
to
the
square
where
amid
the
joyful
acclaim
of
the
populace
their
small
and
hardy
following
were
drawn
up
and
as
they
came
from
townsfolk
and
soldiery
a
shout
arose
beltane
the
duke
the
duke
my
lord
duke
of
mortain
quoth
sir
benedict
i
and
thy
company
do
wait
thee
to
lead
us
but
beltane
smiled
and
shook
his
head
not
so
my
lord
of
bourne
thou
art
so
cunning
in
war
and
hast
led
us
so
valiantly
and
well
shalt
lead
us
to
this
battle
the
which
i
pray
god
shall
be
our
last
as
for
me
this
day
will
i
march
with
the
foresters
so
mount
my
lord
hereupon
from
foresters
from
knights
and
another
shout
arose
what
time
sir
benedict
having
knelt
to
kiss
the
duchess
white
hand
found
it
woefully
alas
my
lady
helen
said
he
methinks
thine
is
the
harder
part
this
day
god
strengthen
thy
wifely
heart
for
god
methinks
shall
yet
bring
him
to
thine
embrace
so
saying
sir
benedict
mounted
and
rode
to
the
head
of
his
lances
where
flew
his
banner
unbar
the
gates
he
cried
and
presently
the
great
gates
of
belsaye
town
swung
wide
the
portcullis
clanked
up
the
drawbridge
fell
and
thus
afar
off
they
beheld
where
swirling
the
battle
raged
fierce
and
fell
and
behold
a
sorry
wight
who
hobbled
toward
them
on
a
crutch
so
begirt
and
bandaged
that
little
was
to
see
of
him
but
bright
eyes
o
sir
hacon
cried
the
duchess
did
i
not
bid
thee
to
thy
bed
why
truly
dear
my
lady
but
since
i
may
not
go
forth
myself
fain
would
i
see
my
good
comrades
ride
into
the
battle
faith
methinks
i
might
yet
couch
a
lance
but
for
fear
of
this
thy
noble
lady
my
lord
beltane
aye
me
this
shall
be
a
dismal
day
for
me
methinks
nay
then
i
will
keep
thee
company
good
sir
hacon
smiled
the
duchess
a
little
tremulously
shalt
watch
with
me
from
the
bartizan
and
tell
me
how
the
day
goeth
with
us
and
now
sir
benedict
lifted
aloft
his
lance
the
trumpet
sounded
and
with
ring
and
tramp
he
with
his
six
hundred
knights
and
rode
forth
of
the
clattering
through
the
narrow
street
thundering
over
the
drawbridge
and
forming
in
the
open
spurred
away
into
the
battle
then
beltane
sighed
and
kneeling
kissed
his
lady
white
hands
beloved
spake
he
now
must
i
go
from
thee
but
howsoever
fortune
tend
thine
am
i
through
life
aye
and
beyond
beltane
she
whispered
quivering
lips
o
loved
beltane
take
heed
to
thy
dear
body
cover
thee
well
with
thy
shield
since
thy
hurts
are
my
hurts
henceforth
and
with
thee
thou
dost
bear
my
heart
o
risk
not
my
heart
to
death
without
good
cause
so
she
bent
and
kissed
him
on
the
brow
but
when
he
would
have
risen
stayed
him
wait
my
lord
she
whispered
and
turning
beckoned
to
one
behind
her
and
lo
genevra
came
forward
bearing
a
blue
banner
my
lord
said
the
duchess
behold
here
thy
banner
that
we
have
wrought
for
thee
genevra
and
i
so
saying
she
took
the
banner
and
gave
it
into
beltane
mailed
hand
but
as
he
arose
and
while
genevra
hands
clasped
upon
the
green
scarf
at
her
bosom
looked
where
the
archers
stood
ranked
forth
stepped
giles
and
spake
quick
and
eager
lord
said
he
methinks
will
be
more
hard
smiting
than
chance
for
good
archery
wherefore
i
do
pray
let
me
bear
thy
standard
in
the
fight
shall
foeman
touch
it
whiles
that
i
do
live
lord
i
pray
thee
be
it
so
giles
so
giles
took
the
banner
whiles
beltane
fitted
on
his
great
plumed
helm
thereafter
comes
roger
with
his
shield
and
ulf
leading
his
charger
whereon
he
mounted
forthwith
and
wheeling
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
pikemen
and
archers
with
roger
and
ulf
mounted
on
either
flank
and
giles
bestriding
another
horse
behind
yet
now
needs
must
he
turn
to
look
his
last
upon
the
duchess
standing
forlorn
and
beholding
the
tender
passion
of
her
tearless
eyes
he
yearned
mightily
to
kiss
them
and
sighed
full
deep
then
giving
the
word
rode
out
and
away
the
blue
standard
upon
the
breeze
but
his
heart
sank
to
hear
the
clash
and
clang
of
gate
and
portcullis
shutting
away
from
him
her
that
was
more
to
him
than
life
itself
now
when
they
had
gone
some
way
needs
must
he
look
back
at
belsaye
its
battered
walls
its
mighty
towers
and
high
upon
the
bartizan
he
beheld
two
figures
the
one
in
many
bandages
and
one
he
knew
who
prayed
for
him
even
then
and
all
at
once
wall
and
towers
and
distant
figures
swam
in
a
mist
of
tears
wherefore
he
closed
his
bascinet
yet
not
before
giles
had
seen
giles
whose
merry
face
was
grim
now
and
and
from
whose
bright
bascinet
a
green
veil
floated
lord
said
he
blinking
bright
eyes
we
have
fought
well
ere
now
but
methinks
we
shall
fight
as
we
fought
in
all
our
days
aye
nodded
beltane
verily
giles
methinks
we
shall
thus
saying
he
turned
and
looked
upon
the
rolling
and
settling
his
feet
within
the
stirrups
clenched
iron
fingers
upon
his
long
sword
chapter
lxix
how
at
last
they
came
to
pentavalon
city
all
day
long
the
din
and
thunder
of
battle
had
roared
upon
the
plain
all
day
the
duchess
helen
with
sir
hacon
at
her
side
had
watched
the
eddying
rolling
now
this
way
now
that
straining
anxious
eyes
to
catch
the
gleam
of
a
white
plume
or
the
flutter
of
the
blue
banner
amid
that
dark
confusion
and
oft
she
heard
sir
hacon
mutter
oaths
and
oft
sir
hacon
had
heard
snatches
of
her
breathless
prayers
as
the
tide
of
battle
swung
to
and
fro
a
desperate
fray
whence
distant
shouts
and
cries
mingled
in
awful
din
but
now
as
the
sun
grew
low
the
fray
began
to
roll
southwards
fast
and
ever
faster
a
mighty
storm
of
eddying
dust
wherein
armour
gleamed
and
steel
glimmered
back
and
forth
as
duke
ivo
and
his
proud
array
fell
back
and
back
on
their
last
stronghold
of
pentavalon
city
whereupon
sir
hacon
upon
the
bartizan
cursed
no
more
but
forgetful
of
his
many
wounds
waxed
jubilant
instead
now
by
holy
rood
he
cried
see
lady
they
break
they
break
was
that
last
flanking
onset
none
but
beltane
the
strong
could
have
marshalled
that
last
charge
drawing
on
black
ivo
to
attempt
his
centre
see
you
and
crushing
in
his
flanks
so
needs
must
their
main
battle
fall
back
or
meet
attack
on
two
sides
oho
a
wondrous
crafty
leader
is
duke
beltane
the
strong
see
ha
see
now
how
fast
he
driveth
them
and
southward
southward
on
pentavalon
town
so
do
i
thank
god
but
see
how
many
o
how
many
do
lie
fallen
by
the
way
why
in
battle
most
gentle
lady
in
battle
men
must
needs
fall
or
wherefore
should
battles
be
much
have
i
seen
of
wars
lady
but
saw
eyes
sterner
fray
than
this
and
i
pray
god
spake
the
duchess
shivering
these
eyes
may
look
upon
another
o
is
hateful
sight
see
look
yonder
and
she
pointed
where
from
the
awful
reeled
men
faint
with
wounds
while
others
dragged
themselves
painfully
across
the
trampled
ground
why
was
a
bloody
business
quoth
the
knight
shaking
his
bandaged
head
sir
hacon
said
the
duchess
frowning
and
pale
i
pray
you
summon
me
the
reeve
yonder
and
when
the
reeve
was
come
she
spake
him
very
soft
and
sweet
messire
i
pray
you
let
us
out
and
aid
the
poor
stricken
souls
yonder
but
lady
the
battle
is
not
yet
won
to
open
our
gates
were
unwise
methinks
good
reeve
one
died
but
lately
whom
all
men
loved
but
dying
friar
martin
spake
these
words
see
belsaye
rich
and
happy
her
gates
ever
open
to
the
woeful
and
distressed
come
ope
the
gates
and
let
us
out
to
cherish
these
afflicted
thus
presently
forth
from
belsaye
rode
the
duchess
helen
with
sir
hacon
beside
her
and
many
of
the
townsfolk
hasting
and
trembling
to
minister
unto
the
hurt
and
dying
and
many
there
were
that
day
who
sighed
out
their
lives
in
blessings
on
her
head
but
meantime
the
battle
roared
fierce
and
furious
as
ever
where
black
ivo
stubborn
ranks
beset
now
on
three
sides
gave
back
sullenly
fighting
step
by
step
and
amid
the
blood
and
dust
in
the
forefront
of
that
raging
tumult
a
torn
and
tattered
blue
banner
rocked
and
swayed
where
beltane
with
giles
at
his
right
hand
led
on
his
grim
foresters
their
ranks
woefully
thinned
and
with
never
a
horse
among
them
but
roger
was
there
his
face
besmeared
with
blood
that
oozed
his
dinted
bascinet
and
ulf
was
there
foul
with
slaughter
and
there
was
walkyn
fierce
and
grim
while
side
by
side
amid
the
trampling
pikemen
behind
jenkyn
and
tall
orson
fought
and
presently
to
beltane
came
walkyn
pointing
eagerly
to
their
left
master
he
cried
yonder
flaunteth
pertolepe
banner
beseech
thee
let
us
make
thitherward
not
so
quoth
beltane
stooping
the
swing
of
a
gisarm
o
forget
thy
selfish
vengeance
man
and
smite
but
for
pentavalon
this
day
her
foes
be
many
enow

he
roared
they
yield
they
yield
close
up
pikes
in
in
follow
me
forward
leapt
he
with
roger
beside
him
and
the
blue
banner
close
behind
and
forward
leapt
those
hardy
foresters
where
the
enemy
reeling
line
strove
desperately
to
stand
and
so
waxed
the
fight
closer
fiercer
griping
hands
fumbled
at
mailed
throats
and
men
locked
in
desperate
grapple
fell
and
were
lost
the
press
but
forward
went
the
tattered
banner
on
and
on
until
checking
it
reeled
dizzily
dipped
swayed
and
vanished
but
roger
had
seen
and
sprang
in
with
darting
point
up
man
he
panted
covering
the
prostrate
archer
with
his
shield
up
giles
an
ye
can

close
beset
but

be
here
roger

cried
a
voice
behind

roared
another
voice
and
roger
assailants
were
borne
back
by
a
line
of
pikes
art
hurt
giles

quoth
the
archer
getting
to
unsteady
legs
but
they
spoiled
me
genevra
veil
methinks
and
our
flag
is
something
smirched
but
as
for

twice
i

and
fell
so
are

quits
good
roger
he
cried
ha
see
they
break
on
pikes
on
bows
and
bills
up
rose
the
dust
forward
swept
the
battle
as
black
ivo
hosts
gave
back
before
the
might
of
mortain
forward
the
blue
banner
reeled
and
staggered
where
fought
beltane
fierce
and
untiring
his
long
shield
hacked
and
dinted
his
white
plumes
shorn
away
while
ever
his
hardy
foresters
smote
and
thrust
on
flank
and
rear
twice
black
roger
fell
and
twice
giles
leapt
him
and
death
and
perceiving
his
haggard
eyes
and
the
pallor
of
his
grimed
and
bloody
cheek
roared
at
him
in
fierce
anxiety

a
muddy
brook
o
blessed
saint
cuthbert
panted
roger
now
before
them
was
a
and
beyond
this
brook
black
harassed
columns
made
a
fierce
and
desperate
rally
what
time
they
strove
to
their
ranks
but
from
duke
midmost
battle
the
trumpets
brayed
fierce
and
loud
whereat
from
a
thousand
parched
throats
a
hoarse
cry
rose
and
chivalry
and
foot
the
men
of
mortain
charged
with
levelled
lance
with
goring
pike
with
whirling
axe
and
sword
and
over
and
through
and
beyond
the
brook
the
battle
raged
sweeping
ever
southwards
presently
before
them
the
ground
sloped
sharply
down
and
while
beltane
shouted
warning
to
those
behind
his
voice
was
drowned
in
sudden
and
glancing
to
his
left
he
beheld
at
last
all
those
knights
and
who
had
ridden
with
his
father
in
their
reserve
all
day
a
glittering
column
rank
on
rank
at
whose
head
his
sable
armour
agleam
his
great
white
charger
leaping
the
spur
duke
beltane
rode
swift
and
sure
the
column
wheeled
and
with
lances
couched
thundered
down
upon
black
ivo
reeling
flank
a
crash
a
sudden
roaring
clamour
and
where
had
marched
black
reserve
of
archers
and
pikemen
was
nought
but
a
scattered
rout
but
on
rode
duke
beltane
his
lion
banner
in
and
through
the
enemy
staggering
columns
and
ever
as
he
charged
thus
upon
their
left
so
charged
sir
jocelyn
upon
their
right
then
beltane
leaned
him
on
his
sword
and
looking
down
upon
the
battle
bowed
his
head
now
praise
be
to
god
and
his
holy
saints
quoth
he
yonder
is
victory
at
last
aye
master
said
roger
hoarsely
and
yonder
as
the
dust
clears
you
shall
see
the
walls
and
towers
of
pentavalon
city
and
lord
lord
cried
walkyn
yonder
in
their
rear
you
shall
see
red
pertolepe
accursed
raven
banner
why
tarry
we
here
lord
see
their
ranks
break
everywhere
be
now
for
the
city
gates
ha
let
us
on
master
aye
verily
quoth
beltane
looking
westward
it
groweth
to
sunset
and
the
city
is
yet
to
storm
to
your
ranks
there
forward
now
as
they
advanced
beltane
beheld
at
last
where
high
above
embattled
walls
and
towers
rose
pentavalon
mighty
keep
wherein
he
had
been
born
and
remembering
his
proud
and
gentle
mother
he
drooped
his
head
and
grieved
and
bethinking
him
of
his
proud
and
gentle
helen
he
took
fresh
grip
upon
his
sword
and
lengthening
his
stride
looked
where
black
ivo
broken
columns
weary
with
battle
grim
with
blood
and
wounds
already
began
to
ride
the
city
frowning
gateway
while
hard
upon
their
straggling
rearguard
duke
beltane
lion
banner
fluttered
a
desperate
hewing
and
thrusting
in
the
narrow
gateway
and
black
ivo
shattered
following
were
driven
in
and
the
narrow
streets
and
alleys
of
the
town
full
of
battle
and
slaughter
street
by
street
the
town
was
won
until
before
them
loomed
the
mighty
keep
of
pentavalon
ducal
stronghold
outer
and
inner
bailey
were
stormed
and
so
at
last
came
they
a
desperate
company
into
the
great
before
the
castle
now
of
a
sudden
a
shout
went
up
and
thereafter
was
a
great
quiet
a
silence
wherein
friend
and
foe
panting
and
weary
stood
alike
at
gaze
and
amid
this
expectant
hush
the
two
dukes
of
pentavalon
fronted
each
other
no
word
said
they
but
while
all
eyes
watched
them
each
took
lance
and
riding
to
the
extremity
of
the
courtyard
wheeled
and
couching
their
lances
spurred
fiercely
against
each
other
and
now
men
held
their
breath
to
behold
these
two
great
knights
who
crouched
low
in
their
saddles
met
midway
in
full
career
with
crash
and
splintering
shock
of
desperate
onset
duke
beltane
reeled
in
his
stirrups
recovered
and
leaning
forward
stared
down
upon
his
enemy
who
prostrate
on
his
back
slowly
lifted
gauntleted
hand
that
falling
weakly
clashed
upon
the
stones
a
small
sound
yet
plain
to
be
heard
by
reason
of
that
breathless
hush
slow
and
stiffly
duke
beltane
dismounted
and
reeling
in
his
gait
came
and
knelt
beside
black
ivo
and
loosed
off
his
riven
helm
thereafter
slow
and
painfully
he
arose
and
looking
round
upon
all
men
spake
god
hath
judged
betwixt
us
this
day
said
he
and
methinks
he
doth
summon
me
to
judgment
even
as
he
spake
he
lifted
his
hands
struggling
with
the
lacing
of
his
helmet
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
wherefore
beltane
sprang
forward
yet
one
there
was
quicker
than
he
one
whose
goodly
armour
smirched
and
battered
yet
showed
the
blazon
of
bourne
benedict
quoth
duke
beltane
feebly
faithful
wert
thou
to
the
last
o
benedict
where
is
my
noble
son
father
cried
beltane
thou
hast
this
day
won
pentavalon
from
her
shame
and
misery
but
the
duke
lay
very
still
in
their
arms
and
spake
no
word
so
when
they
had
uncovered
his
white
head
they
bore
him
tenderly
into
the
great
banqueting
hall
and
laid
him
on
goodly
couch
and
cherished
him
with
water
and
wine
wherefore
in
a
while
he
opened
swooning
eyes
beltane
he
whispered
dear
and
noble
son
thy
manhood
hath
belike
won
thy
father
soul
to
god
mercy
so
do
i
leave
thee
to
cherish
all
those
that
have
known
wrong
and
woe
by
reason
of
my
selfish
life
dear
son
bury
me
with
thy
noble
mother
but
let
me
lie
at
her
feet
beltane
o
had
i
been
less
selfish
in
my
sorrow
but
god
is
merciful
benedict
kiss
me
and
thou
my
beltane
god
calleth
me
to
rest
manus
tuas
domine
then
duke
beltane
that
had
been
the
hermit
ambrose
clasped
his
mailed
hands
and
smiling
wondrous
glad
and
tender
yielded
his
soul
to
god
in
a
while
beltane
came
forth
into
the
courtyard
and
beheld
sir
jocelyn
mustering
their
knightly
prisoners
in
the
ward
below
for
with
black
ivo
death
all
resistance
was
ended
and
now
the
trumpets
blared
rallying
their
various
companies
but
beltane
abode
very
full
of
sorrowful
thoughts
to
him
presently
cometh
giles
yet
grasping
the
blue
standard
befouled
with
dust
and
blood
the
which
he
laid
reverently
at
beltane
feet
lord
said
he
my
trust
is
ended
see
yonder
standeth
our
company
of
foresters
and
he
pointed
where
a
single
rank
of
grimed
and
weary
men
lay
upon
the
hard
or
leaned
on
their
battered
weapons
giles
o
giles
is
this
all
aye
lord
we
muster
but
seventy
and
one
all
told
and
of
these
tall

yonder
in
jenkyn

and
roger
poor
roger
is
methinks
and
ulf
and
walkyn
are
not
but
even
as
he
spake
he
turned
and
started
for
from
the
ward
below
a
hunting
horn
brayed
feebly
is
our
forester
rally
master
quoth
he
and
see
jesu
what
men
are
these
for
into
the
courtyard
followed
by
many
who
gaped
and
stared
in
wonderment
six
men
staggered
men
hideously
stained
and
besplashed
from
head
to
foot
and
foremost
came
two
and
walkyn
was
one
and
ulf
the
strong
the
other
now
as
he
came
walkyn
stared
in
strange
wild
fashion
and
choked
often
in
his
breathing
and
his
mailed
feet
dragged
feebly
insomuch
that
he
would
have
fallen
but
for
ulf
mighty
arm
being
come
where
beltane
stood
with
sir
benedict
and
many
other
wondering
knights
and
nobles
walkyn
halted
and
strove
to
speak
but
choked
again
instead
in
one
hand
bare
he
his
great
axe
and
in
the
other
a
torn
and
stained
lord
quoth
he
in
sobbing
breaths
a
good
day
for
thee
this
lord
duke
a
good
day
for
pentavalon
a
joyous
day
blessed
day
for

lord
duke
keep
thou
mine
axe
in
memory
of
walkyn
is
a
goodly
axe
hath
served
me
well
today
behold
now
as
he
spake
he
loosed
a
corner
of
the
and
from
its
grimed
and
ghastly
folds
there
rolled
forth
into
the
red
light
of
the
cleanly
sun
a
thing
that
trundled
softly
across
the
pavement
and
stopping
shewed
a
pallid
face
crowned
with
red
hair
which
upon
the
brow
betwixt
the
staring
eyes
was
a
jagged
scar
like
to
a
cross
now
while
all
men
stared
upon
this
direful
thing
holding
their
breaths
walkyn
laughed
loud
and
high
and
breaking
from
ulf
clasp
staggered
to
where
it
lay
and
pointed
thereto
with
shaking
finger
behold
he
cried
behold
the
head
of
bloody
pertolepe
therewith
he
laughed
and
strove
to
kick
it
with
feeble
foot
but
staggered
instead
and
loosing
his
axe
stretched
wide
his
long
arms
and
fell
face
downward
bloody
pertolepe
is
dead
he
cried
and
choked
and
choking
died
chapter
lxx
which
speaketh
for
itself
it
was
not
the
piping
of
throstle
or
merle
that
had
waked
my
beltane
who
with
slumberous
eyes
stared
up
at
carven
canopy
round
him
upon
rich
arras
and
down
upon
embroidered
and
silken
pillow
while
through
the
narrow
lattice
the
young
sun
played
upon
gilded
and
polished
floor
so
lay
beltane
blinking
sleepy
eyes
and
hearkening
to
a
soft
and
melodious
whistling
from
the
little
garden
below
his
casement
being
thus
heavy
with
sleep
he
wondered
drowsily
what
great
content
was
this
that
filled
him
and
wherefore
wondering
yet
he
sighed
and
because
of
the
sun
radiance
closed
slumberous
eyes
again
and
would
have
slept
but
of
a
sudden
the
whistling
ceased
and
a
rich
sweet
voice
fell
to
gentle
singing
hark
in
the
whisper
of
the
wind
love
calleth
thee
away
each
leaf
a
small
soft
voice
doth
find
each
pretty
bird
doth
cry
in
kind
o
heart
haste
north
beltane
sat
up
broad
awake
for
blaen

to
the
north
and
in
blaen
but
giles
was
singing
on
youth
is
quick
to
speed
away
but
love
abideth
ever
fortune
though
she

fickle
is
and
will
not
stay

never
the

but
changeth
never
proud

but

the

beltane
was
leaning
half
out
of
the
casement
of
the
which
fact
who
so
unconscious
as
giles
busily
furbishing
armour
and
bascinet
giles
he
cried
o
giles
rouse
ye
man
how
lord
art
awake
so
early
questioned

looking
up
innocent
of
eye

eagerly

north
to
blaen
where
else
should
we
ride
so
saying
beltane
turned
back
into
his
sumptuous
chamber
and
fell
to
donning
not
his
habiliments
of
state
but
those
garments
all
frayed
by
his
heavy
mail
swift
dressed
he
and
almost
stealthily
oft
pausing
to
glance
into
the
empty
garden
below
and
oft
staying
to
listen
to
some
sound
within
the
massy
building
and
thus
it
was
he
started
to
hear
a
soft
knocking
at
the
door
and
turning
beheld
sir
benedict
forsooth
art
up
betimes
my
lord
duke
quoth
he
bright
eyes
and
verily
i
do

pipe
and
tabor
and
enough
enough
benedict
prithee
why
must
i
needs
endure
this
such
things
do
wait
upon
success
beltane
and
moreover
duke
aye
verily
duke
the
which
mindeth
me
that
being
duke
it
behoveth
thee
and
yet
benedict
i
do
tell
thee
that
all
things
must
wait
awhile
methinks
or
better
do
you
attend
them
for
me
nay
i
am
no
duke
quoth
sir
benedict
hastily
yet
thou
art
my
chiefest
counsellor
and
lord
seneschal
of
pentavalon
so
to
thy
wise
judgment
i
do
entrust
all
matters
soever
but
i
have
no
warranty
thou
cunning
boy
and
shalt
have
my
bond
my
ducal
ring
nay
the
very
crown
itself
howbeit
this
day
wilt
ride
for
mortain
o
lover
said
sir
benedict
smiling
his
wry
smile
aye
verily
dear
benedict
nor
shall
aught
under
heaven
let
or
stay
me
yet
how
knew
ye
this
benedict
for
that
is
so
my
heart
would
have
prompted
had
i
been
so
blessed
as
thou
art
dear
my
beltane
and
knowing
thou
needs
must
to
thy
beauteous
helen
i
have
a
meal
prepared
within
my
chamber
come
your
ways
and
let
us
eat
together
so
came
they
to
a
handsome
chamber
hard
by
where
was
spread
a
goodly
repast
whereto
they
did
full
justice
though
talking
much
the
while
until
one
tapped
lightly
upon
the
door
and
roger
entered
bearing
beltane
mail
nay
good
roger
said
beltane
smiling
need
for
that
is
done
methinks
we
ride
light
but
sir
benedict
shook
wise
head
my
lord
is
true
our
wars
be
ended
i
thank
god
and
we
may
sheathe
our
swords
at
last
but
the
woods
be
full
of
black
ivo
scattered
soldiery
with
outlaws
and
other
masterless
men
ha
verily
lords
quoth
roger
there
shall
many
turn
outlaw
methinks
then
must
we
end
outlawry
said
beltane
frowning
and
how
do
it
beltane
make
an
end
of
the
game
laws
benedict
throw
wide
the
forests
to
all
who
will
but
master
thus
shall
every
rogue
be
free
to
kill
for
his
base
sport
thy
goodly
deer
or
belike
a
hart
of
ten
fit
for
sport
of
kings
well
let
them
in
this
thing
be
kings
but
i
do
hold
a
man
life
dearer
than
a
stag
so
henceforth
in
pentavalon
the
woods
are
free
i
pray
you
let
this
be
proclaimed
forthwith
my
lord
quoth
sir
benedict
as
with
roger
aid
beltane
did
on
his
armour
there
is
a
postern
beyond
the
pleasaunce
yonder
shall
bring
you
forth
of
the
city
and
no
man
the
wiser
why
then
bring
ye
the
horses
thither
roger
and
haste
ye
now
when
roger
was
gone
sir
benedict
arose
and
setting
his
hands
on
beltane
shoulders
questioned
him
full
serious
mean
ye
forsooth
to
make
the
forests
free
beltane
aye
verily
benedict
this
shall
cause
much
discontent
among
the
lords
well
we
wear
swords
benedict
but
this
i
swear
whiles
i
am
duke
never
again
shall
a
man
hang
for
killing
of
my
deer
moreover
is
my
intent
forthwith
to
lower
all
taxes
more
especially
in
the
market
towns
to
extend
their
charters
and
grant
them
new
privileges
beltane
i
fear
thy
years
shall
be
full
of
discord
what
matter
an
my
people
prosper
but
thou
art
older
and
much
wiser
than
i
benedict
bethink
thee
of
these
things
then
i
pray
and
judge
how
best
such
changes
may
be
for
a
week
hence
god
willing
i
summon
my
first
council
but
now
dear
benedict
i
go
to
find
my
happiness
farewell
my
lord
god
speed
thee
my
beltane
o
lad
lad
the
heart
of
benedict
goeth
with
thee
methinks
and
sir
benedict
turned
suddenly
away
then
beltane
took
and
clasped
those
strong
and
able
hands
benedict
said
he
truer
friend
man
never
had
than
thou
and
for
this
i
do
love
thee
and
thou
art
wise
and
valiant
and
and
thou
didst
love
my
noble
mother
with
a
noble
love
and
for
this
do
i
love
thee
best
of
all
dear
friend
then
benedict
lifted
his
head
and
like
father
and
son
they
kissed
each
other
and
together
went
forth
into
the
sweet
morn
beyond
the
postern
were
giles
and
black
roger
with
the
horses
and
giles
sang
blithe
beneath
his
breath
but
roger
sighed
oft
and
deep
now
being
mounted
beltane
reined
close
beside
sir
benedict
and
smiled
full
joyous
and
spake
him
thus
dear
benedict
one
that
loveth
thee
doth
ride
away
but
in
a
week
two
that
love
thee
shall
return
and
needs
must
these
two
love
thee
ever
and
always
very
greatly
benedict
since
but
for
thee
they
had
not
come
to
their
joy
so
saying
he
touched
spur
to
flank
and
bounded
away
with
giles
and
roger
spurring
behind
soon
were
they
free
of
the
city
and
reaching
that
rolling
down
where
the
battle
had
raged
so
lately
beltane
set
his
horse
to
a
stretching
gallop
and
away
they
raced
over
upland
and
lowland
until
they
beheld
afar
to
their
right
the
walls
and
towers
of
belsaye
but
on
they
rode
toward
the
green
of
the
woods
and
ever
as
they
rode
giles
sang
full
blithely
to
himself
whiles
roger
gloomed
and
sighed
wherefore
at
last
the
archer
turned
to
clap
him
on
the
shoulder
what
aileth
thee
my
rogerkin
quoth
he
ha
growled
roger
the
world
waggeth
well
with
thee
giles
these
days
but
as
for
me
poor
roger
lacketh
saint
cuthbert
knoweth
i
have
striven
and
likewise
plagued
him
sore
upon
the
matter
and
yet
my
belt
my
accursed
belt
yet
beareth
a
notch
behold
why
is
but
a
single
notch
roger
yet
a
notch
it
is
forsooth
and
how
shall
my
heart
go
light
and
my
soul
clean
until
i
have
a
belt
with
notches
not
one
belike
thou
hast
forgot
some
of
the
lives
thou
didst
save
roger
mine
thou
didst
save
four
times
within
the
battle
i
mind
me
nay
was
but
twice
giles
why
then
was
thrice
roger
the
banner
hampered
me
and
was
but
twice
alack
sighed
roger
saint
cuthbert
knoweth
was
but
twice
and
being
a
very
watchful
saint
may
not
be
cheated
giles
why
then
roger
do
ye
beset
him
in
prayer
so
while
thou
dost
hold
him
in
play
thus
i
will
snick
away
thy
solitary
notch
so
sweetly
he
shall
never
know
alack
not
avail
giles
i
must
needs
bear
this
notch
with
me
unto
the
grave
belike
nay
roger
i
will
to
artifice
and
subtle
stratagem
on
thy
behalf
as
mark
me
i
do
know
a
pool
beside
the
way
now
if
i
slip
within
the
pool
and
thou
pull
me
from
the
pool
how
then
ha
is
well
bethought
let
were
it
any
but
saint
cuthbert
sighed
roger
but
i
do
thank
thee
for
thy
kindly
thought
giles
now
after
this
went
they
some
way
in
silence
beltane
riding
ahead
very
full
of
thought
and
his
companions
behind
the
one
smiling
and
debonair
the
other
frowning
and
sad
forsooth
quoth
giles
at
last
as
thou
sayest
roger
the
world
waggeth
well
with
me
hast
heard
belike
our
lady
duchess
hath
been
pleased
to
aye
i
heard
my
lord
bailiff
who
hath
not
nay
i
did
but
mention
it
to
two
or
three
quoth
giles
moreover
our
lord
doth
smile
on
me
these
days
though
forsooth
he
hath
been
familiar
with
me
since
first
i
found
him
within
the
green
long
ere
he
found
thee
rogerkin
i
rode
a
white
ass
i
mind
me
and
my
lord
walked
beside
me
very
fair
and
whereupon
i
called
him
sir
dove
o
me
a
dove
mark
you
since
when
as
ye
know
we
have
been
comrades
he
and
i
nay
rather
very
close
in
his
counsels
very
near
to
all
his
thoughts
and
actions
all
of
the
which
cometh
of
possessing
a
tongue
as
ready
as
my
wit
rogerkin
now
as
he
hearkened
roger
frown
grew
blacker
and
his
powerful
hand
clenched
upon
the
bridle
and
yet
quoth
giles
as
i
am
in
my
lord
dear
friendship
so
art
thou
in
mine
roger
man
nor
in
my
vaulting
fortunes
will
i
forget
thee
belike
within
mortain
shalt
aid
me
in
my
new
duties
or
shall
i
speak
my
lord
on
thy
behalf
ha
cried
roger
suddenly
first
tell
me
this
my
lord
steward
and
high
bailiff
of
mortain
did
the
duke
my
master
chance
ever
to
take
thy
hand
to
wet
it
with
his
tears
and
kiss
it
art
mad
roger
wherefore
should
my
lord
do
this
aye
nodded
roger
wherefore
and
when
giles
had
whistled
awhile
and
roger
had
scowled
awhile
the
archer
spake
again
hast
never
been
in
love
roger
never
saint
cuthbert
be
praised
then
canst
know
nought
of
the
joy
and
wonder
of
it
so
will
i
make
for
thee
a
song
of
love
as
thus
open
thine
ears
and
hearken
so
fair
so
sweet
so
pure
is
she
i
do
thank
god
her
love
an
armour
is
to
me
sorrow
and
adversity
so
in
my
song
right
joyfully
i
do
thank
god
for
love
her
love
a
cloak
is
round
me
cast
i
do
thank
god
to
cherish
me
fortunes
blast
her
love
forgetting
evils
past
shall
lift
me
up
to
heaven
at
last
so
i
thank
god
for
love
here
is
a
fair
song
methinks
dost
not
wonder
at
love
now
roger
and
the
glory
of
it
i
wonder
quoth
roger
how
long
thou
shalt
believe
all
this
when
thou
art
wed
i
wonder
how
long
thou
wilt
live
true
to
her
when
she
is
thy
wife
now
hereupon
the
archer
comely
face
grew
red
grew
pale
his
bronzed
hands
flew
to
his
belt
and
leapt
on
high
gripping
his
dagger
but
roger
had
seen
his
fingers
closed
on
the
descending
wrist
and
they
grappled
swaying
in
their
saddles
grim
and
silent
they
slipped
to
earth
and
strove
together
on
the
ling
but
roger
had
giles
in
a
cruel
wrenched
him
bent
him
and
bearing
him
to
earth
wrested
away
the
dagger
and
raised
it
above
the
archer
naked
throat
and
giles
lying
powerless
beneath
looked
up
into
roger
fierce
scowling
face
and
seeing
no
pity
there
his
pale
cheek
grew
paler
and
in
his
eyes
came
an
agony
of
broken
hopes
but
his
gaze
quailed
not
and
when
he
spake
his
voice
was
firm
strike
true
comrade
said
he
the
hand
above
him
wavered
the
dagger
was
dashed
aside
and
covering
his
face
black
roger
crouched
there
his
broad
shoulders
and
powerful
figure
quaking
and
shivering
then
giles
arose
and
stepping
to
his
dagger
came
back
with
it
grasped
in
his
hand
roger
said
he
quoth
roger
his
face
still
hidden
my
throat
is
bare
also
archer
roger
comrade
give
to
me
thy
belt
now
at
this
roger
looked
up
wondering
my
belt
quoth
he
what
would
ye
giles
cut
away
thy
last
notch
roger
thy
belt
shall
go
henceforth
and
thy
soul
clean
methinks
but
i
meant
to
slay
thee
giles
but
spared
me
roger
spared
me
to
life
and
love
my
rogerkin
o
friend
give
me
thy
belt
so
roger
gave
him
the
belt
wherefrom
giles
forthwith
cut
the
last
notch
which
done
they
together
like
mischievous
lads
turned
to
look
where
their
lord
rode
far
ahead
and
beholding
him
all
unconscious
and
lost
in
thought
they
sighed
their
relief
and
mounting
went
on
together
now
did
roger
oft
glance
at
giles
who
kept
his
face
averted
and
held
his
peace
whereat
roger
grew
uneasy
fidgeted
in
his
saddle
fumbled
with
the
reins
and
at
last
spake
giles
aye
roger
forgive
me
but
giles
neither
turned
nor
spake
wherefore
contrite
roger
must
needs
set
an
arm
about
him
and
turn
him
about
and
behold
the
archer
eyes
were
brimming
with
great
tears
o
giles
gasped
roger
o
giles
roger
i
i
do
love
her
man
i
do
love
her
heart
and
soul
is
this
so
hard
to
believe
roger
or
dost
think
me
rogue
so
base
that
true
love
is
beyond
me
is
true
i
am
unworthy
and
yet
i
do
verily
love
her
roger
wilt
forgive
me
forgive
me
giles
aye
roger
for
truly
we
have
saved
each
other
lives
so
oft
we
must
needs
be
friends
thou
and
i
only
thy
words
did
did
hurt
me
friend
for
indeed
this
love
of
mine
hath
in
it
much
of
heaven
roger
and
there
be
times
when
i
do
dream
of
mayhap
teaching
a
little
giles
to
loose
a
straight
shaft
some
day
o
sweet
jesu
make
me
worthy
amen
and
now
beltane
glancing
up
and
finding
the
sun
high
summoned
giles
and
roger
beside
him
friends
said
he
we
have
journeyed
farther
than
methought
now
let
us
turn
into
the
boskage
yonder
and
eat
so
in
a
while
the
horses
tethered
behold
them
within
a
leafy
bower
eating
and
drinking
and
laughing
like
the
blithe
foresters
they
were
until
their
hunger
assuaged
they
made
ready
to
mount
but
of
a
sudden
the
bushes
parted
near
by
and
a
man
stepped
forth
a
small
man
he
plump
and
buxom
whose
quick
bright
eyes
twinkled
his
hat
as
he
saluted
beltane
with
obeisance
very
humble
and
lowly
quoth
he
right
noble
and
most
resplendent
lord
duke
beltane
i
do
most
humbly
greet
thee
i
lubbo
past
pardoner
of
the
holy
see
who
but
a
poor
plain
soul
am
do
offer
thee
my
very
insignificant
yet
most
sincere
felicitous
good
wishes
my
thanks
are
thine
pardoner
what
more
would
you
breath
lord
methinks
said
giles
wind
my
lord
after
periods
so
profound
and
sonorous
lord
duke
right
puissant
and
most
potential
i
would
but
tell
thee
this
to
wit
that
i
did
keep
faith
with
thee
that
i
by
means
of
this
unworthy
hand
did
set
thee
beyond
care
lift
thee
above
sorrow
and
gave
to
thee
the
heaven
of
thy
most
warm
and
earnest
desires
how
mean
you
pardoner
lord
duke
when
thou
didst
bestow
life
on
two
poor
rogues
upon
a
time
when
one
rogue
stole
away
minded
to
betray
thee
to
thine
enemy
the
second
rogue
did
steal
upon
the
first
rogue
and
this
second
rogue
bare
a
small
knife
whereof
the
first
rogue
suddenly
died
and
thus
duke
ivo
thine
enemy
came
not
before
belsaye
until
thou
and
thy
company
were
safe
within
its
walls
so
by
reason
of
this
poor
second
rogue
pentavalon
doth
rejoice
in
freedom
is
singing
on
every
village
green
happiness
is
in
the
very
air
for
is
pentavalon
beltane
and
beltane
is
a
sweet
season
so
doth
this
poor
second
rogue
find
him
recompense
verily
art
well
named
lord
beltane
since
in
thee
pentavalon
winter
is
passed
away
and
spring
is
come
o
happy
season
of
beltane
o
season
of
new
beginnings
and
new
hopes
so
my
lord
beltane
may
it
ever
be
beltane
with
thee
may
it
be
sweet
spring
ever
within
thy
noble
heart
god
keep
thee
and
farewell
so
saying
the
pardoner
turned
about
and
plunging
into
the
dense
green
was
gone
a
pestilent
wordy
fellow
lord
quoth
giles
one
of
your
windy
talkers
that
talketh
that
no
other
talker
may
talk
now
give
me
a
good
listener
say
i
and
yet
said
beltane
swinging
to
saddle
spake
he
truly
i
wonder
had
ivo
been
a
little
sooner
we
had
not
been
here
methinks
on
they
rode
through
sun
and
shadow
knee
and
knee
beneath
leafy
arches
and
along
green
glades
talking
and
laughing
together
or
plunged
in
happy
thought
quoth
beltane
of
a
sudden
roger
hast
heard
how
giles
waxeth
in
fortune
these
days
and
methinks
no
man
is
more
worthy
master
giles
is
for
sure
a
man
of
parts
aye
more
especially
of
tongue
roger
as
when
he
did
curse
the
folk
of
belsaye
out
o
their
fears
master
moreover
he
is
a
notable
archer
and
art
not
envious
then
roger
not
i
master

come
cried
beltane
and
spurred
to
a
gallop
thus
rode
they
through
the
leafy
avoiding
town
and
village
yet
oft
from
afar
they
heard
the
joyous
throb
of
bells
upon
the
air
or
the
sound
of
merry
voices
and
happy
laughter
from
village
commons
where
folk
rejoiced
together
that
ivo
iron
yoke
was
lifted
from
them
at
last
but
beltane
kept
ever
to
the
woods
and
lest
being
recognised
he
should
be
stayed
longer
from
her
of
whom
he
dreamed
bethinking
him
ever
of
the
deep
shy
passion
of
her
eyes
the
soft
tones
of
her
voice
the
clinging
warmth
of
her
caress
and
all
the
sweet
warm
beauty
of
her
betimes
they
crossed
the
marches
into
mortain
but
it
was
late
evening
ere
they
saw
at
last
the
sleepy
manor
of
blaen
its
white
walls
and
steepy
roofs
dominated
by
its
one
square
above
which
a
standard
stirring
lazily
in
the
gentle
air
discovered
the
red
lion
of
pentavalon
and
now
beltane
breath
grew
short
and
thick
his
strong
hand
trembled
on
the
bridle
and
he
grew
alternate
hot
and
cold
so
rode
they
into
the
echoing
courtyard
whither
hasted
old
godric
to
welcome
them
and
divers
servants
to
take
their
horses
being
ushered
forthwith
into
the
garden
now
who
so
silent
and
awkward
as
my
beltane
what
time
his
lady
duchess
made
known
to
him
her
gentle
ladies
among
whom
sweet
genevra
flushed
of
cheek
gazed
breathless
upon
giles
even
as
giles
gazed
upon
her
who
so
mumchance
as
beltane
i
say
who
saw
and
heard
and
was
conscious
only
of
one
among
them
all
and
who
so
stately
so
and
dignified
as
this
one
until
aye
until
they
stood
alone
together
and
then
to
see
her
sway
to
his
fierce
arms
all
clinging
yearning
womanhood
her
state
and
dignity
forgotten
quite
to
hear
her
voice
soft
and
low
and
all
with
love
broken
with
sighs
and
sinking
to
questioning
and
thou
art
come
back
to
me
at
last
beltane
hast
brought
to
me
my
heart
unharmed
from
the
battle
beloved
and
thou
didst
take
no
hurt
no
hurt
my
beltane
and
art
glad
to
see
thy
wife
beltane
and
dost
love
me
as
much
as
ever
beltane
o
wilt
never
never
leave
me
desolate
again
my
lord
art
thou
mine
mine
henceforth
as
i
am
thine
beltane
and
wilt
desire
me
ever
near
thee
my
lord
helen
said
he
o
my
the
beautiful
our
wars
be
ended
our
time
of
waiting
is
done
i
thank
god
so
am
i
here
to
claim
thee
beloved
art
glad
to
be
in
mine
arms
glad
i
am
come
to
make
thee
mine
own
at
last
helen
i
had
died
without
thee
beltane
i
would
not
live
without
thee
now
my
beltane
see
my
lord
i
o
how
may
i
speak
if
thus
you
seal
my
lips
beltane
and
prithee
how
may
i
show
thee
this
gown
i
wear
for
thee
if
thou
wilt
hold
me
so
so
very
close
beltane
and
in
a
while
as
the
moon
rose
she
brought
him
into
that
bower
he
well
remembered
and
bade
him
admire
the
beauty
of
her
many
flowers
and
he
viewing
her
loveliness
alway
praised
the
flowers
exceeding
much
yet
beheld
them
not
at
all
wherefore
she
chid
him
and
yet
chiding
yielded
him
her
scarlet
mouth
thus
walked
they
in
the
fragrant
garden
until
genevra
found
them
and
bid
them
in
to
sup
but
the
duchess
took
genevra
slender
hands
and
looked
within
her
shy
sweet
eyes
art
happy
sweet
maid
she
questioned
o
dear
my
lady
methinks
in
all
this
big
world
is
none
more
happy
than
thy
grateful
genevra
then
haste
thee
back
to
thy
happiness
dear
genevra
we
will
see
thee
and
presently
came
they
within
a
small
chamber
and
here
beltane
did
off
his
armour
and
here
they
supped
together
though
now
the
lady
helen
spake
little
and
ate
less
and
oft
her
cheek
rebuked
the
worshipping
passion
of
his
eyes
insomuch
that
presently
she
arose
and
going
into
the
great
chamber
beyond
came
back
and
kneeling
at
his
feet
showed
him
a
file
beltane
said
she
thou
didst
upon
a
time
tell
poor
fidelis
wherefore
thy
shameful
fetters
yet
bound
thy
wrists
so
now
will
thy
wife
loose
them
from
thee
then
while
beltane
speaking
not
watched
her
downbent
head
and
busy
hands
she
filed
off
his
fetters
one
by
one
and
kissing
them
set
them
aside
but
when
she
would
have
risen
he
prevented
her
and
with
reverent
fingers
touched
the
coiled
and
braided
glory
of
her
hair
o
helen
he
whispered
loose
me
down
thy
hair
nay
dear
beltane
my
hands
are
so
big
and
clumsy
thy
hands
are
my
hands
and
she
caught
and
kissed
them
let
down
for
me
thy
hair
beloved
i
pray
thee
forsooth
my
lord
and
so
i
will
but
not
yet
but
the
the
hour
groweth
late
helen
nay
indeed
is
early
yet
my
lord
nay
as
thou
wilt
my
beltane
only
suffer
that
i
i
leave
thee
a
while
i
pray
must
i
bide
here
alone
sweet
wife
but
indeed
i
will
call
thee
anon
my
lord
nay
first
look
at
me
my
helen
slowly
slowly
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
on
him
all
sweet
and
aye
truly
truly
thine
eyes
are
not
a
nun
eyes
helen
so
will
i
wait
thy
bidding
so
he
loosed
her
and
she
looking
on
him
no
more
turned
and
hasted
into
the
further
chamber
and
after
some
while
she
called
to
him
very
soft
and
sweet
and
he
trembling
arose
and
entered
the
chamber
and
fragrant
but
now
beholding
wherefore
she
had
left
him
his
breath
caught
and
he
stood
as
one
entranced
nor
moved
nor
spake
he
a
while
o
helen
he
murmured
at
last
thou
art
glorious
so
and
with
thy
long
hair
but
now
even
as
he
came
to
her
the
duchess
helen
put
out
the
little
silver
lamp
but
in
the
moonlit
dusk
she
gave
her
lips
to
his
and
her
tender
arms
were
close
about
him
beltane
she
whispered
his
kiss
dear
my
lord
and
husband
here
is
an
end
at
last
of
sorrow
and
i
pray
here
my
helen
beginneth
the
fulness
of
life
methinks
now
presently
upon
the
stillness
from
the
court
below
stole
the
notes
of
a
lute
and
therewith
a
rich
voice
upraised
in
singing
o
when
is
the
time
a
maid
to
kiss
tell
me
this
now
tell
me
this
is
when
the
day
is
scarce
begun
is
from
the
setting
of
the
sun
is
time
for
kissing
ever
done
tell
me
this
now
tell
me
this
the
end
