chapter
i
my
companions
and
our
adversities
and
in
particular
from
our
getting
into
the
stocks
at
tottenham
cross
to
our
being
robbed

there
being
no
plays
to
be
acted
at
the

because
of
the
plague
and

of

and

daughter

ned
herring
and
myself
clubbed
our
monies
together
to
buy
a
store
of
dresses
painted
cloths
and
the
like
with
a
cart
and
horse
to
carry
them
and
thus
provided
set
forth
to
travel
the
country
and
turn
an
honest
penny
in
those
parts
where
the
terror
of
pestilence
had
not
yet
turned
stomachs
against
the
pleasures
of
life
and
here
at
our
setting
out
let
me
show
what
kind
of
company
we
were
first
then
for
our
master
jack
dawson
who
on
no
occasion
was
to
be
given
a
second
place
he
was
a
hale
jolly
fellow
who
would
eat
a
pound
of
beef
for
his
breakfast
when
he
could
get
it
and
make
nothing
of
half
a
gallon
of
ale
therewith
a
very
masterful
man
but
kindly
withal
and
pleasant
to
look
at
when
not
contraried
with
never
a
line
of
care
in
his
face
though
turned
of
fifty
he
played
our
humorous
parts
but
he
had
a
sweet
voice
for
singing
of
ditties
and
could
fetch
a
tear
as
readily
as
a
laugh
and
he
was
also
exceeding
nimble
at
a
dance
which
was
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
considering
his
great
girth
wife
he
had
none
but
moll
dawson
was
his
daughter
who
was
a
most
sprightly
merry
little
wench
but
no
miracle
for
beauty
being
neither
child
nor
woman
at
this
time
surprisingly
thin
as
if
her
frame
had
grown
out
of
proportion
with
her
flesh
so
that
her
body
looked
all
arms
and
legs
and
her
head
all
mouth
and
eyes
with
a
great
towzled
mass
of
chestnut
hair
which
off
the
stage
was
as
often
as
not
half
tumbled
over
her
shoulder
but
a
quicker
little
baggage
at
mimicry
she
would
play
any
part
from
an
urchin
of
ten
to
a
crone
of
fourscore
or
a
livelier
at
dancing
of
brantles
or
the
single
coranto
never
was
i
do
think
and
as
merry
as
a
grig
of
ned
herring
i
need
only
here
say
that
he
was
the
most
tearing
villain
imaginable
on
the
stage
and
off
it
the
most
young
gentleman
nor
need
i
trouble
to
give
a
very
lengthy
description
of
myself
what
my
character
was
will
appear
hereafter
and
as
for
my
looks
the
less
i
say
about
them
the
better
being
something
of
a
scholar
and
a
poet
i
had
nearly
died
of
starvation
when
jack
dawson
gave
me
a
footing
on
the
stage
where
i
would
play
the
part
of
a
hero
in
one
act
a
lacquey
in
the
second
and
a
merry
andrew
in
the
third
scraping
a
tune
on
my
fiddle
to
fill
up
the
intermedios
we
had
designed
to
return
to
london
as
soon
as
the
plague
abated
unless
we
were
favoured
with
extraordinary
good
fortune
and
so
when
we
heard
that
the
sickness
was
certainly
past
and
the
citizens
recovering
of
their
panic
we
being
by
this
time
heartily
sick
of
our
venture
which
at
the
best
gave
us
but
beggarly
recompense
set
about
to
retrace
our
steps
with
cheerful
expectations
of
better
times
but
coming
to
oxford
we
there
learned
that
a
prodigious
fire
had
burnt
all
london
down
from
the
tower
to
ludgate
so
that
if
we
were
there
we
should
find
no
house
to
play
in
this
lay
us
flat
in
our
hopes
and
set
us
again
to
our
vagabond
enterprise
and
so
for
six
months
more
we
scoured
the
country
in
a
most
miserable
plight
the
roads
being
exceedingly
foul
and
folks
more
humoured
of
nights
to
drowse
in
their
chimnies
than
to
sit
in
a
draughty
barn
and
witness
our
performances
and
then
about
the
middle
of
february
we
in
a
kind
of
desperation
got
back
again
to
london
only
to
find
that
we
must
go
forth
again
the
town
still
lying
in
ruins
and
no
one
disposed
to
any
kind
of
amusement
except
in
high
places
where
such
actors
as
we
were
held
in
contempt
so
we
with
our
hearts
in
our
boots
as
one
may
say
set
out
again
to
seek
our
fortunes
on
the
cambridge
road
and
here
with
no
better
luck
than
elsewhere
for
at
tottenham
cross
we
had
the
mischance
to
set
fire
to
the
barn
wherein
we
were
playing
by
a
candle
falling
in
some
loose
straw
whereby
we
did
injury
to
the
extent
of
some
shilling
or
two
for
which
the
farmer
would
have
us
pay
a
pound
and
jack
dawson
stoutly
refusing
to
satisfy
his
demand
he
sends
for
the
constable
who
locks
us
all
up
in
the
cage
that
night
to
take
us
before
the
magistrate
in
the
morning
and
we
found
to
our
cost
that
this
magistrate
had
as
little
justice
as
mercy
in
his
composition
for
though
he
lent
a
patient
ear
to
the
farmer
case
he
would
not
listen
to
jack
dawson
argument
which
was
good
enough
being
to
the
effect
that
we
had
not
as
much
as
a
pound
amongst
us
and
that
he
would
rather
be
hanged
than
pay
it
if
he
had
and
when
ned
herring
seeing
the
kind
of
puritanical
fellow
he
was
urged
that
since
the
damage
was
not
done
by
any
design
of
ours
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
visitation
of
providence
he
says
very
good
if
it
be
the
will
of
providence
that
one
should
be
scourged
i
take
it
as
the
divine
purpose
that
i
should
finish
the
business
by
scourging
the
other
and
therewith
he
orders
the
constable
to
take
what
money
we
have
from
our
pockets
and
clap
us
in
the
stocks
till
sundown
for
payment
of
the
difference
so
in
the
stocks
we
three
poor
men
were
stuck
for
six
mortal
hours
which
was
a
wicked
cruel
thing
indeed
with
the
wind
blowing
a
sort
of
rainy
snow
about
our
ears
and
there
i
do
think
we
must
have
perished
of
cold
and
vexation
but
that
our
little
moll
brought
us
a
sheet
for
a
cover
and
tired
not
in
giving
us
kind
words
of
comfort
at
five
the
constable
unlocked
us
from
our
vile
confinement
and
i
do
believe
we
should
have
fallen
upon
him
and
done
him
a
mischief
for
his
pains
there
and
then
but
that
we
were
all
frozen
as
stiff
as
stones
with
sitting
in
the
cold
so
long
and
indeed
it
was
some
time
ere
we
could
move
our
limbs
at
all
however
with
much
ado
we
hobbled
on
at
the
tail
of
our
cart
all
three
very
bitter
but
especially
ned
herring
who
cursed
most
horridly
and
as
i
had
never
heard
him
curse
off
the
stage
saying
he
would
rather
have
stayed
in
london
to
carry
links
for
the
gentry
than
join
us
again
in
this
damnable
adventure
etc
and
that
which
incensed
him
the
more
was
the
merriment
of
our
moll
who
seated
on
the
side
of
the
cart
could
do
nothing
better
than
make
sport
of
our
discontent
but
there
was
no
malice
in
her
laughter
which
if
it
sprang
not
from
sheer
love
of
mischief
arose
maybe
from
overflowing
joy
at
our
release
coming
at
dusk
to
edmonton
and
finding
a
fine
new
inn
there
called
the
bell
jack
dawson
leads
the
cart
into
the
yard
we
following
without
a
word
of
demur
and
after
putting
up
our
trap
into
the
warm
parlour
we
go
and
call
for
supper
as
boldly
as
you
please
then
when
we
had
eaten
and
drunk
till
we
could
no
more
all
to
bed
like
princes
which
after
a
night
in
the
cage
and
a
day
in
the
stocks
did
seem
like
a
very
paradise
but
how
we
were
to
pay
for
this
entertainment
not
one
of
us
knew
nor
did
we
greatly
care
being
made
quite
reckless
by
our
necessities
it
was
the
next
morning
when
we
met
together
at
breakfast
that
our
faces
betrayed
some
compunctions
but
these
did
not
prevent
us
eating
prodigiously
for
whispers
ned
herring
if
we
are
to
be
hanged
it
may
as
well
be
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
however
jack
dawson
getting
on
the
right
side
of
the
landlord
who
seemed
a
very
honest
decent
man
for
an
innkeeper
agreed
with
him
that
we
should
give
a
performance
that
night
in
a
very
proper
to
our
purpose
giving
him
half
of
our
taking
in
payment
of
our
entertainment
this
did
jack
thinking
from
our
late
we
should
get
at
the
most
a
dozen
people
in
the
sixpenny
benches
and
a
score
standing
at
twopence
a
head
but
it
turned
out
as
the
cunning
landlord
had
foreseen
that
our
hanger
was
packed
close
to
the
very
door
in
consequence
of
great
numbers
coming
to
the
town
in
the
afternoon
to
see
a
bull
baited
so
that
when
jack
dawson
closed
the
doors
and
came
behind
our
scene
to
dress
for
his
part
he
told
us
he
had
as
good
as
five
pounds
in
his
pocket
with
that
to
cheer
us
we
played
our
tragedy
of
the
broken
heart
very
merrily
and
after
that
changing
our
dresses
in
a
twinkling
jack
dawson
disguised
as
a
wild
man
and
moll
as
a
wood
nymph
came
on
to
the
stage
to
dance
a
pastoral
whilst
i
in
the
fashion
of
a
satyr
stood
on
one
side
plying
the
fiddle
to
their
footing
then
all
being
done
jack
thanks
the
company
for
their
indulgence
and
bids
and
now
before
all
the
company
are
yet
out
of
the
place
and
while
jack
dawson
is
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
face
comes
the
landlord
and
asks
pretty
bluntly
to
be
paid
his
share
of
our
earnings
well
says
jack
in
a
huff
i
see
no
reason
for
any
such
haste
but
if
you
will
give
me
time
to
put
on
my
breeches
you
shall
be
paid
all
the
same
and
therewith
he
takes
down
his
trunks
from
the
nail
where
they
hung
and
first
giving
them
a
doubtful
shake
as
seeming
lighter
than
he
expected
and
hearing
no
chink
of
money
he
thrusts
his
hand
into
one
pocket
and
then
into
the
other
and
cries
in
dismay
mercy
upon
us
we
are
robbed
every
penny
of
our
money
is
gone
can
you
think
of
nothing
better
than
such
an
idle
story
as
that
says
the
landlord
there
hath
been
none
behind
this
sheet
but
yourselves
all
the
night
we
could
make
no
reply
to
this
but
stood
gaping
at
each
other
in
a
maze
for
some
seconds
then
jack
dawson
recovering
his
wits
turns
him
round
and
looking
about
cries
why
where
ned
herring
if
you
mean
him
as
was
killed
in
your
play
says
the
landlord
answer
for
it
he
not
far
off
for
to
my
knowledge
he
was
in
the
house
drinking
with
a
man
while
you
were
of
your
antics
like
a
fool
and
i
only
hope
you
may
be
as
honest
a
man
as
he
for
he
paid
for
his
liquor
like
a
gentleman
that
settled
the
question
for
we
knew
the
constable
had
left
never
a
penny
in
his
pocket
when
he
clapt
us
in
the
stocks
well
says
jack
he
has
our
money
as
you
may
prove
by
searching
us
and
if
you
have
faith
in
him
is
all
as
one
and
you
may
rest
easy
for
your
reckoning
being
paid
against
his
return
the
landlord
went
off
vowing
he
would
take
the
law
of
us
if
he
were
not
paid
by
the
morning
and
we
as
soon
as
we
had
shuffled
on
our
clothes
away
to
hunt
for
ned
thinking
that
maybe
he
had
made
off
with
the
money
to
avoid
paying
half
to
the
landlord
and
hoping
always
that
though
he
might
play
the
rogue
with
him
he
would
deal
honestly
by
us
but
we
could
find
no
trace
of
him
though
we
visited
every
alehouse
in
the
town
and
so
back
we
go
crestfallen
to
the
bell
to
beg
the
innkeeper
to
give
us
a
night
lodging
and
a
crust
of
bread
on
the
speculation
that
ned
would
come
back
and
settle
our
accounts
but
he
would
not
listen
to
our
prayers
and
so
hungry
and
thirsty
and
miserable
beyond
expression
we
were
fain
to
make
up
with
a
loft
over
the
stables
where
thanks
to
a
good
store
of
sweet
hay
we
soon
forgot
our
troubles
in
sleep
but
not
before
we
had
concerted
to
get
away
in
the
morning
betimes
to
escape
another
day
in
the
stocks
accordingly
before
the
break
of
day
we
were
afoot
and
after
noiselessly
packing
our
effects
in
the
cart
in
the
misty
grey
light
jack
dawson
goes
in
the
stable
to
harness
our
nag
while
i
as
silently
take
down
the
heavy
bar
that
fastened
the
yard
gate
but
while
i
was
yet
fumbling
at
the
bolts
and
all
of
a
shake
for
fear
of
being
caught
in
the
act
jack
dawson
comes
to
me
with
moll
holding
of
his
hand
as
she
would
when
our
troubles
were
great
and
says
in
a
tone
of
despair
give
over
kit
we
are
all
undone
again
for
our
harness
is
stole
and
there
never
another
i
can
take
in
its
place
while
we
were
at
this
stumble
out
comes
our
landlord
to
make
sport
of
us
have
you
found
your
money
yet
friends
says
he
with
a
sneer
no
says
jack
savagely
and
our
money
is
not
all
that
we
have
lost
for
some
villain
has
filched
our
nag
harness
and
i
warrant
you
know
who
he
is
why
to
be
sure
returns
the
other
the
same
friend
may
have
taken
it
who
has
gone
astray
with
your
other
belongings
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
answer
for
it
when
your
money
is
found
your
harness
will
be
forthcoming
and
not
before
come
master
says
i
have
you
no
more
heart
than
to
make
merry
at
the
mischances
of
three
poor
wretches
such
as
we
aye
says
he
when
you
can
show
that
you
deserve
better
treatment
done
says
jack
i
show
you
that
as
quickly
as
you
please
with
that
he
whips
off
his
cap
and
flinging
it
on
the
ground
cries
off
with
your
jacket
man
and
let
us
prove
by
such
means
as
heaven
has
given
all
which
is
the
honester
of
us
two
and
so
he
squares
himself
up
to
fight
but
the
innkeeper
though
as
big
a
man
as
he
being
of
a
spongy
constitution
showed
no
relish
for
this
mode
of
argument
and
turning
his
back
on
us
with
a
shake
of
the
head
said
he
was
very
well
satisfied
of
his
own
honesty
and
if
we
doubted
it
we
could
seek
what
satisfaction
the
law
would
give
us
adding
slyly
as
he
turned
at
the
door
that
he
could
recommend
us
a
magistrate
of
his
acquaintance
naming
him
who
had
set
us
in
the
stocks
at
tottenham
cross
the
very
hint
of
this
put
us
again
in
a
quake
and
now
the
snow
beginning
to
fall
pretty
heavily
we
went
into
the
shed
to
cast
about
as
to
what
on
earth
we
should
do
next
there
we
sat
glum
and
silent
watching
idly
the
big
flakes
of
snow
fluttering
down
from
the
leaden
sky
for
not
one
of
us
could
imagine
a
way
out
of
this
hobble
holy
mother
cries
jack
at
length
springing
up
in
a
passion
we
can
not
sit
here
and
starve
of
cold
and
hunger
cuddle
up
to
my
arm
moll
and
do
you
bring
your
fiddle
kit
and
let
us
try
our
luck
in
alehouses
and
so
we
trudged
out
into
the
driving
snow
that
blinded
us
as
we
walked
bow
our
heads
as
we
might
and
tried
one
alehouse
after
the
other
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
parlours
being
empty
because
of
the
early
hour
and
the
snow
keeping
folks
within
doors
only
about
midday
some
carters
who
had
pulled
up
at
an
inn
took
pity
on
us
and
gave
us
a
mug
of
penny
ale
and
half
a
loaf
and
that
was
all
the
food
we
had
the
whole
miserable
day
then
at
dusk
and
fagged
out
in
mind
and
body
we
trudged
back
to
the
bell
thinking
to
get
back
into
the
loft
and
bury
ourselves
in
the
sweet
hay
for
warmth
and
comfort
but
coming
hither
we
found
our
nag
turned
out
of
the
stable
and
the
door
locked
so
that
we
were
thrown
quite
into
despair
by
the
loss
of
this
last
poor
hope
and
poor
moll
turning
her
face
away
from
us
burst
out
she
who
all
day
had
set
us
a
brave
example
by
her
cheerful
merry
spirit
chapter
ii
our
first
acquaintance
with
the
señor
don
sanchez
del
castillo
de
castelaña
and
his
brave
entertaining
of
i
was
taking
a
turn
or
two
outside
the
shed
for
the
sight
of
jack
dawson
hugging
poor
moll
to
his
breast
and
trying
to
soothe
her
bodily
misery
with
gentle
words
was
more
than
i
could
bear
when
a
drawer
coming
across
from
the
inn
told
me
that
a
gentleman
in
the
cherry
room
would
have
us
come
to
him
i
gave
him
a
civil
answer
and
carried
this
message
to
my
friends
moll
who
had
staunched
her
tears
and
was
smiling
piteously
though
her
sobs
like
those
of
a
child
still
shook
her
thin
frame
and
her
father
both
looked
at
me
in
blank
doubt
as
fearing
some
trap
for
our
further
discomfiture
nay
says
jack
stoutly
fate
can
serve
us
no
worse
within
doors
than
without
so
let
us
in
and
face
this
gentleman
whoever
he
is
so
in
we
go
and
all
sodden
and
bedrabbled
as
we
were
went
to
follow
the
drawer
upstairs
when
the
landlady
cried
out
she
would
not
have
us
go
into
her
cherry
room
in
that
pickle
to
soil
her
best
furniture
and
disgrace
her
house
and
bade
the
fellow
carry
us
into
the
kitchen
to
take
off
our
cloaks
and
change
our
boots
for
adding
that
if
we
had
any
respect
for
ourselves
we
should
trim
our
hair
and
wash
the
grime
off
our
faces
so
we
enter
the
kitchen
nothing
loath
where
a
couple
of
pullets
browning
on
the
spit
kettles
bubbling
on
the
fire
and
a
pasty
drawing
from
the
oven
filled
the
air
with
delicious
odours
that
nearly
drove
us
mad
for
envy
and
to
think
that
these
good
things
were
to
tempt
the
appetite
of
some
one
who
never
hungered
while
we
famishing
for
want
had
not
even
a
crust
to
appease
our
cravings
but
it
was
some
comfort
to
plunge
our
blue
numbed
fingers
into
a
tub
of
hot
water
and
feel
the
life
blood
creeping
back
into
our
hearts
the
paint
we
had
put
on
our
cheeks
the
night
before
was
streaked
all
over
our
faces
by
the
snow
so
that
we
did
look
the
veriest
scarecrows
imaginable
but
after
washing
our
heads
well
and
stroking
our
hair
into
order
with
a
comb
mistress
cook
lent
us
we
looked
not
so
bad
and
thus
changed
and
with
dry
shoes
to
our
feet
we
at
length
went
upstairs
all
full
of
wondering
expectation
and
were
led
into
the
cherry
room
which
seemed
to
us
a
very
palace
being
lit
with
half
a
dozen
candles
and
they
of
wax
and
filled
with
a
warm
glow
by
the
blazing
logs
on
the
hearth
reflected
in
the
cherry
hangings
and
there
in
the
midst
was
a
table
laid
for
supper
with
a
wondrous
white
cloth
glasses
to
drink
from
and
silver
forks
all
set
out
most
bravely
his
worship
will
be
down
ere
long
says
the
drawer
and
with
that
he
makes
a
pretence
of
building
up
the
fire
being
warned
thereto
very
like
by
the
landlady
with
an
eye
to
the
safety
of
her
silver
can
you
tell
me
his
worship
name
friend
i
whispered
my
mind
turning
at
once
to
his
worship
of
tottenham
cross
not
i
were
you
to
pay
me
says
he
is
that
outlandish
and
uncommon
but
for
sure
he
is
some
great
foreign
grandee
he
could
tell
us
no
more
so
we
stood
there
all
together
wondering
till
presently
the
door
opens
and
a
tall
lean
gentleman
enters
with
a
high
front
very
finely
dressed
in
linen
stockings
a
coat
and
embroidered
waistcoat
and
rich
lace
at
his
cuffs
and
throat
he
wore
no
peruke
but
his
own
hair
cut
quite
close
to
his
head
with
a
pointed
beard
and
a
pair
of
long
moustachios
twisting
up
almost
to
his
ears
but
his
appearance
was
the
more
striking
by
reason
of
his
beard
and
moustachios
being
quite
black
while
the
hair
on
his
head
was
white
as
silver
he
had
dark
brows
also
that
overhung
very
rich
black
eyes
his
nose
was
long
and
hooked
and
his
skin
which
was
of
a
very
dark
complexion
was
closely
lined
with
wrinkles
about
the
eyes
while
a
deep
furrow
lay
betwixt
his
brows
he
carried
his
head
very
high
and
was
majestic
and
gracious
in
all
his
movements
not
one
of
which
as
it
seemed
to
me
was
made
but
of
forethought
and
purpose
i
should
say
his
age
was
about
sixty
though
his
step
and
carriage
were
of
a
younger
man
to
my
eyes
he
appeared
a
very
handsome
and
a
pleasing
amiable
gentleman
but
lord
what
can
you
conclude
of
a
man
at
a
single
glance
when
every
line
in
his
face
of
which
he
had
a
score
and
more
has
each
its
history
of
varying
passions
known
only
to
himself
and
secret
phases
of
his
life
he
saluted
us
with
a
most
noble
bow
and
dismissed
the
drawer
with
a
word
in
an
undertone
then
turning
again
to
us
he
said
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
act
last
night
and
dance
he
adds
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
to
moll
naturally
i
wish
to
be
better
acquainted
with
you
will
it
please
you
to
dine
with
me
i
could
not
have
been
more
dumbfounded
had
an
angel
asked
me
to
step
into
heaven
but
dawson
was
quick
enough
to
say
something
that
will
we
cries
he
and
god
bless
your
worship
for
taking
pity
on
us
for
i
doubt
not
you
have
heard
of
our
troubles
the
other
bowed
his
head
and
set
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
for
moll
which
she
took
with
a
pretty
curtsey
but
saying
never
a
word
for
glee
did
seem
to
choke
us
all
and
being
seated
she
cast
her
eyes
on
the
bread
hungrily
as
if
she
would
fain
begin
at
once
but
she
had
the
good
manners
to
restrain
herself
then
his
worship
as
we
called
him
having
shown
us
the
chairs
on
either
side
seated
himself
last
of
all
at
the
head
of
the
table
facing
our
moll
whom
whenever
he
might
without
discourtesy
he
regarded
with
most
scrutinising
glances
from
first
to
last
then
the
door
flinging
open
two
drawers
brought
in
those
same
fat
pullets
we
had
seen
browning
before
the
fire
and
also
the
pasty
with
abundance
of
other
good
cheer
at
which
moll
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
whispers
to
me
is
like
a
dream
do
speak
to
me
kit
or
i
must
think
all
fade
away
presently
and
leave
us
in
the
snow
then
i
finding
my
tongue
begged
his
worship
would
pardon
us
if
our
manners
were
more
uncouth
than
the
society
to
which
he
was
accustomed
nay
says
dawson
your
worship
will
like
us
none
the
worse
i
warrant
for
seeing
what
we
are
and
aping
none
finding
himself
thus
beworshipped
on
both
hands
our
good
friend
says
you
may
call
me
señor
i
am
a
spaniard
don
sanchez
del
castillo
de
castelaña
and
then
to
turn
the
subject
he
adds
i
have
seen
you
play
twice
aye
señor
and
i
should
have
known
you
again
if
by
nothing
but
this
piece
of
generosity
replies
dawson
with
his
cheek
full
of
pasty
for
i
remember
both
times
you
set
down
a
piece
and
would
take
no
change
don
sanchez
hunched
his
shoulders
cavalierly
as
if
such
trifles
were
nought
to
him
but
indeed
throughout
his
manner
was
most
high
and
noble
and
now
being
fairly
settled
down
to
our
repast
we
said
no
more
of
any
moment
that
i
can
recall
to
mind
till
we
had
done
which
was
not
until
nought
remained
of
the
pullets
and
the
pasty
but
a
few
bones
and
the
bare
dish
and
we
were
drawn
round
the
fire
at
don
invitation
then
the
drawers
having
cleared
the
tables
brought
up
a
huge
bowl
of
hot
spiced
wine
a
dish
of
tobacco
and
some
pipes
the
don
then
offered
us
to
smoke
some
cigarros
but
we
not
understanding
them
took
instead
our
homely
pipes
and
each
with
a
beaker
of
hot
wine
to
his
hand
sat
roasting
before
the
fire
scarce
saying
a
word
the
don
being
silent
because
his
humour
was
of
the
reflective
grave
kind
with
all
his
courtesies
he
never
smiled
as
if
such
demonstrations
were
unbecoming
to
his
dignity
and
we
from
repletion
and
a
feeling
of
wondrous
contentment
and
repose
and
another
thing
served
to
keep
us
still
which
was
that
our
moll
sitting
beside
her
father
almost
at
once
fell
asleep
her
head
lying
against
his
shoulder
as
he
sat
with
his
arm
about
her
waist
as
at
the
table
don
sanchez
had
seated
himself
where
he
could
best
observe
her
and
now
he
scarcely
once
took
his
eyes
off
her
which
were
half
closed
as
if
in
speculation
at
length
taking
the
cigarro
from
his
lips
he
says
softly
to
jack
dawson
so
as
not
to
arouse
moll
your
daughter
jack
nods
for
an
answer
and
looking
down
on
her
face
with
pride
and
tenderness
he
put
back
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
a
little
curl
that
had
strayed
over
her
eyes
she
was
not
amiss
for
looks
thus
with
her
long
eyelashes
lying
like
a
fringe
upon
her
cheeks
her
lips
open
showing
her
good
white
teeth
and
the
glow
of
the
firelight
upon
her
face
but
her
attitude
and
the
innocent
happy
expression
of
her
features
made
up
a
picture
which
seemed
to
me
mighty
pretty
where
is
her
mother
asks
don
sanchez
presently
and
dawson
without
taking
his
eyes
from
moll
face
lifts
his
pipe
upwards
while
his
big
thick
lips
fell
maybe
he
was
thinking
of
his
poor
betty
as
he
looked
at
the
child
face
has
she
no
other
relatives
asks
the
don
in
the
same
quiet
tone
and
jack
shakes
his
head
still
looking
down
and
answers
lowly
only
me
then
after
another
pause
the
don
asks
what
will
become
of
her
and
that
thought
also
must
have
been
in
jack
dawson
mind
for
without
seeming
surprised
by
the
question
which
appeared
a
strange
one
he
answers
reverently
but
with
a
shake
in
his
hoarse
voice
almighty
god
knows
this
stilled
us
all
for
the
moment
and
then
don
sanchez
seeing
that
these
reflections
threw
a
gloom
upon
us
turned
to
me
sitting
next
him
and
asked
if
i
would
give
him
some
account
of
my
history
whereupon
i
briefly
told
him
how
three
years
ago
jack
dawson
had
lifted
me
out
of
the
mire
and
how
since
then
we
had
lived
in
brotherhood
and
says
i
in
conclusion
we
will
continue
with
the
favour
of
providence
to
live
so
sharing
good
and
ill
fortune
alike
to
the
end
so
much
we
do
love
one
another
to
this
jack
dawson
nods
assent
and
your
other
fellow
what
of
him
asked
don
sanchez
i
replied
that
ned
herring
was
but
a
friend
who
had
joined
fortunes
with
us
to
get
out
of
london
and
escape
the
plague
and
how
having
robbed
us
we
were
like
never
to
see
his
face
again
and
well
for
him
if
we
do
not
cries
dawson
rousing
up
for
by
the
lord
if
i
clap
eyes
on
him
though
it
be
a
score
of
years
hence
he
sha
escape
the
most
horrid
beating
ever
man
outlived
the
don
nodded
his
satisfaction
at
this
and
then
moll
awaking
with
the
sudden
outburst
of
her
father
voice
gives
first
a
gape
then
a
shiver
and
looking
about
her
with
an
air
of
wonder
smiles
as
her
eye
fell
on
the
don
whereon
still
as
solemn
as
any
judge
he
pulls
the
bell
and
the
maid
coming
to
the
room
with
a
rushlight
he
bids
her
take
the
poor
weary
child
to
bed
and
the
best
there
is
in
the
house
which
i
think
did
delight
dawson
not
less
than
his
moll
to
hear
then
moll
gives
her
father
a
kiss
and
me
another
according
to
her
wont
and
drops
a
civil
curtsey
to
don
sanchez
give
me
thy
hand
child
says
he
and
having
it
he
lifts
it
to
his
lips
and
kisses
it
as
if
she
had
been
the
finest
lady
in
the
land
she
being
gone
the
don
calls
for
a
second
bowl
of
spiced
wine
and
we
mightily
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
another
of
comfort
stretch
our
legs
out
afresh
before
the
fire
then
don
sanchez
lighting
another
cigarro
and
setting
his
chair
towards
us
says
as
he
takes
his
knee
up
betwixt
his
long
thin
fingers
now
let
us
come
to
the
heart
of
this
business
and
understand
one
another
clearly
chapter
iii
that
design
which
don
sanchez
opened
to
us
at
the
we
pulled
our
pipes
from
our
mouths
dawson
and
i
and
stretched
our
ears
very
eager
to
know
what
this
business
was
the
don
had
to
propound
and
he
after
drawing
two
or
three
mouthfuls
of
smoke
which
he
expelled
through
his
nostrils
in
a
most
surprising
unnatural
manner
says
in
excellent
good
english
but
speaking
mighty
slow
and
giving
every
letter
its
worth
what
do
you
go
to
do
the
lord
only
knows
answers
jack
and
don
sanchez
lifting
his
eyebrows
as
if
he
considers
this
no
answer
at
all
he
continues
we
can
not
go
hence
with
none
of
our
stage
things
and
if
we
could
i
see
not
how
we
are
to
act
our
play
now
that
our
villain
is
gone
with
a
plague
to
him
i
doubt
but
we
must
sell
all
that
we
have
for
the
few
shillings
they
will
fetch
to
get
us
out
of
this
hobble
with
our
landlord
permission
remarks
don
sanchez
dryly
permission
cries
dawson
in
a
passion
i
ask
no
man
permission
to
do
what
i
please
with
my
own
suppose
he
claims
these
things
in
payment
of
the
money
you
owe
him
what
then
asks
the
don
we
never
thought
of
that
kit
says
dawson
turning
to
me
in
a
pucker
but
is
likely
enough
he
has
for
i
observed
he
was
mighty
careless
whether
we
found
our
thief
or
not
that
it
sure
enough
we
have
nought
to
hope
all
lost
with
that
he
drops
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
stares
into
the
fire
with
a
most
desponding
countenance
being
in
that
stage
of
liquor
when
a
man
must
either
laugh
or
weep
come
jack
says
i
you
are
not
used
to
yield
like
this
let
us
make
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
and
face
the
worst
like
men
though
we
trudge
hence
with
nothing
but
the
rags
on
our
backs
we
shall
be
no
worse
off
than
we
were
this
morning
why
that
true
enough
cries
he
plucking
up
his
courage
let
the
thieving
rascal
take
our
poor
nag
and
our
things
for
his
payment
and
much
good
may
they
do
him
we
will
wipe
this
out
of
our
memory
the
moment
we
leave
his
cursed
inn
behind
us
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
would
not
greatly
advance
us
and
maybe
don
sanchez
thought
the
same
for
he
presently
asks
and
what
then
why
señor
replies
dawson
we
will
face
each
new
buffet
as
it
comes
and
make
a
good
fight
of
it
till
we
beat
a
man
may
die
but
once
you
think
only
of
yourselves
says
the
don
very
quietly
and
pray
saving
your
señor
presence
who
else
should
we
think
of
the
child
above
answers
the
don
a
little
more
sternly
than
he
had
yet
spoken
is
a
young
creature
like
that
to
bear
the
buffets
you
are
so
bold
to
meet
can
you
offer
her
no
shelter
from
the
wind
and
rain
but
such
as
chance
offers
make
no
provision
for
the
time
when
she
is
left
alone
to
protect
her
against
the
evils
that
lie
in
the
path
of
friendless
maids
god
forgive
me
says
jack
humbly
and
then
we
could
say
nothing
for
thinking
what
might
befall
moll
if
we
should
be
parted
but
sat
there
under
the
keen
eye
of
don
sanchez
looking
helplessly
into
the
fire
and
there
was
no
sound
until
jack
pipe
slipping
from
his
hand
fell
and
broke
in
pieces
upon
the
hearth
then
rousing
himself
up
and
turning
to
don
sanchez
he
says
the
lord
help
her
señor
if
we
find
no
good
friend
to
lend
us
a
few
shillings
for
our
present
wants
good
friends
are
few
says
the
don
and
they
who
lend
need
some
better
security
for
repayment
than
chance
for
my
own
part
i
would
as
soon
fling
straws
to
a
drowning
man
as
attempt
to
save
you
and
that
child
from
ruin
by
setting
you
on
your
feet
only
to
fall
again
if
that
be
so
señor
says
i
you
had
some
larger
view
in
mind
than
that
of
offering
temporary
relief
to
our
misery
when
you
gave
us
a
supper
and
moll
a
bed
for
the
night
don
sanchez
assented
with
a
grave
inclination
of
his
head
and
going
to
the
door
opened
it
sharply
listened
awhile
and
then
closing
it
softly
returned
and
stood
before
us
with
folded
arms
then
in
a
low
voice
not
to
be
heard
beyond
the
room
he
questioned
us
very
particularly
as
to
our
relations
with
other
men
the
length
of
time
we
had
been
wandering
about
the
country
and
especially
about
the
tractability
of
moll
and
being
satisfied
with
our
replies
above
all
with
jack
saying
that
moll
would
jump
out
of
window
at
his
bidding
without
a
thought
to
the
consequences
he
says
there
a
comedy
we
might
play
to
some
advantage
if
you
were
minded
to
take
the
parts
i
give
you
and
act
them
as
i
direct
with
all
my
heart
cries
dawson
i
play
any
part
you
choose
and
as
to
the
directing
you
welcome
to
that
for
i
had
my
fill
of
it
if
you
can
make
terms
with
our
landlord
those
things
in
the
yard
shall
be
yours
and
for
our
payment
i
willing
to
trust
to
your
generosity
as
regards
payment
says
the
don
i
can
speak
precisely
we
shall
gain
fifty
thousand
pounds
by
our
performance
fifty
thousand
pounds
says
jack
as
if
in
doubt
whether
he
had
heard
aright
don
sanchez
bent
his
head
without
stirring
a
line
in
his
face
dawson
took
up
his
beaker
slowly
and
looked
in
it
to
make
sure
that
he
was
none
the
worse
for
drink
then
after
emptying
it
to
steady
his
wits
he
says
again
fifty
thousand
pounds
fifty
thousand
pounds
if
not
more
and
that
there
be
no
jealousies
one
of
the
other
it
shall
be
divided
fairly
amongst
us
as
much
for
your
friend
as
for
you
for
the
child
as
for
me
pray
god
this
part
be
no
more
than
i
can
compass
says
jack
devoutly
you
may
learn
it
in
a
few
hours
at
least
your
first
act
and
mine
says
i
entering
for
the
first
time
into
the
dialogue
the
don
hunched
his
shoulders
lifting
his
eyebrows
and
sending
two
streams
of
smoke
from
his
nose
i
scarce
know
what
part
to
give
you
yet
says
he
to
be
honest
you
are
not
wanted
at
all
in
the
play
nay
but
you
must
write
him
a
part
says
dawson
stoutly
if
it
be
but
to
bring
in
a
letter
that
i
am
determined
on
kit
stood
by
us
in
ill
fortune
and
he
shall
share
better
or
i
have
none
of
it
nor
moll
neither
i
answer
for
her
there
must
be
no
discontent
among
us
says
the
don
meaning
thereby
as
i
think
that
he
had
included
me
in
his
stratagem
for
fear
i
might
mar
it
from
envy
the
girl
part
is
that
which
gives
me
most
concern
and
had
i
not
faith
in
my
own
judgment
set
your
mind
at
ease
on
that
score
cried
jack
i
warrant
our
moll
shall
learn
her
part
in
a
couple
of
days
or
so
if
she
learn
it
in
a
twelvemonth
be
time
enough
a
twelvemonth
said
jack
going
to
his
beaker
again
for
understanding
well
all
as
one
so
that
we
can
get
something
in
advance
of
our
payment
to
keep
us
through
such
a
prodigious
study
i
will
charge
myself
with
your
expenses
says
don
sanchez
and
then
turning
to
me
he
asks
if
i
have
any
objection
to
urge
i
take
it
señor
that
you
speak
in
metaphor
says
i
and
that
this
is
nought
but
a
stratagem
for
getting
hold
of
a
fortune
that
does
belong
to
us
don
sanchez
calmly
assented
as
if
this
had
been
the
most
innocent
design
in
the
world
hang
me
cries
dawson
if
i
thought
it
was
anything
but
a
whimsey
of
your
honour
i
should
like
to
know
if
we
may
carry
out
this
stratagem
honestly
says
i
aye
cries
jack
i
not
agree
for
cutting
of
throats
or
breaking
of
bones
for
any
money
i
can
tell
you
no
more
than
this
says
the
don
the
fortune
we
may
take
is
now
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
has
no
more
right
to
it
than
we
have
if
that
so
says
jack
i
with
you
señor
for
i
as
lief
bustle
a
thief
out
of
his
gains
as
say
my
prayers
any
day
and
liefer
still
says
i
the
money
must
of
right
belong
to
some
one
we
will
say
that
the
money
belongs
to
a
child
of
the
same
age
as
moll
then
it
comes
to
this
señor
says
i
bluntly
we
are
to
rob
that
child
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
when
you
speak
of
robbing
says
the
don
drawing
himself
up
with
much
dignity
you
forget
that
i
am
to
play
a
part
in
this
stratagem
i
don
sanchez
del
castillo
de
castelaña
fie
kit
ha
you
any
manners
cries
dick
what
all
this
talk
of
a
child
has
the
señor
told
us
we
are
but
to
bustle
a
cheat
but
i
would
know
what
is
to
become
of
this
child
if
we
take
her
fortune
though
it
be
withheld
from
her
by
another
says
i
being
exceeding
obstinate
and
persistent
in
my
liquor
i
shall
prove
to
your
conviction
says
the
don
that
the
child
will
be
no
worse
off
if
we
take
this
money
than
if
we
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
that
rascally
steward
but
i
see
adds
he
contemptuously
that
for
all
your
brotherly
love
is
no
such
matter
to
you
whether
poor
little
molly
comes
to
her
ruin
as
every
maid
must
who
goes
to
the
stage
or
is
set
beyond
the
reach
of
temptation
and
the
goading
of
want
aye
and
be
hanged
to
you
kit
cries
dawson
tell
me
mr
poet
continues
don
sanchez
do
you
consider
this
steward
who
defrauds
that
child
of
a
fortune
is
more
unfeeling
than
you
who
for
a
sickly
qualm
of
conscience
would
let
slip
this
chance
of
making
molly
an
honest
woman
aye
answer
that
kit
adds
jack
striking
his
mug
on
the
table
i
answer
you
morning
señor
says
i
and
whether
i
fall
in
with
the
scheme
or
not
is
all
as
one
since
my
help
is
not
needed
for
if
it
be
to
moll
good
i
bid
you
farewell
and
you
shall
see
me
never
again
spoken
like
a
man
says
don
sanchez
and
a
wise
one
to
boot
an
enterprise
of
this
nature
is
not
to
be
undertaken
without
reflection
like
the
smoking
of
a
pipe
if
you
put
your
foot
forward
it
must
be
with
the
understanding
that
you
can
not
go
back
i
must
have
that
assurance
for
i
shall
be
hundreds
of
pounds
out
of
pocket
ere
i
can
get
any
return
for
my
venture
have
no
fear
of
me
or
of
moll
turning
tail
at
a
scarecrow
says
jack
adding
with
a
sneer
we
are
no
poets
reflect
upon
it
argue
it
out
with
your
friend
here
whose
scruples
do
not
displease
me
and
let
me
know
your
determination
when
the
last
word
is
said
business
carries
me
to
london
but
you
shall
meet
me
at
night
and
we
will
close
the
business
aye
or
nay
ere
supper
with
that
he
opens
the
door
and
gives
us
our
congee
the
most
noble
in
the
world
but
not
offering
to
give
us
a
bed
we
are
forced
to
go
out
of
doors
and
grope
our
way
through
the
snow
to
the
and
seek
a
shelter
there
from
the
wind
which
was
all
the
keener
and
more
bitter
for
our
leaving
a
good
fire
and
i
believe
the
shrewd
spaniard
had
put
us
to
this
pinch
as
a
foretaste
of
the
misery
we
must
endure
if
we
rejected
his
design
and
so
to
shape
our
inclinations
to
his
happily
the
landlord
coming
out
with
a
lantern
and
finding
us
by
the
chattering
of
our
teeth
was
moved
by
the
consideration
shown
us
by
don
sanchez
to
relax
his
severity
and
so
unlocking
the
stable
door
he
bade
us
get
up
into
the
loft
which
we
did
blessing
him
as
if
he
had
been
the
best
christian
in
the
world
and
then
having
buried
ourselves
in
hay
jack
dawson
and
i
fell
to
arguing
the
matter
in
question
i
sticking
to
my
scruples
partly
from
vanity
and
he
stoutly
holding
side
and
i
being
warmed
by
my
own
eloquence
and
he
not
less
heated
by
liquor
having
taken
best
part
of
the
last
bowl
to
his
share
we
ran
it
pretty
high
so
that
at
one
point
jack
was
for
lighting
a
candle
end
he
had
in
his
pocket
and
fighting
it
out
like
men
but
little
by
little
we
cooled
down
and
towards
morning
each
giving
way
something
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
would
have
don
sanchez
show
us
the
steward
that
we
might
know
the
truth
of
his
story
which
i
misdoubted
seeing
that
it
was
but
a
roguish
kind
of
game
at
best
that
he
would
have
us
take
part
in
and
that
if
we
found
all
things
as
he
represented
them
then
we
would
accept
his
offer
and
also
we
resolved
to
be
down
betimes
and
let
him
know
our
determination
before
he
set
out
for
london
to
the
end
that
we
might
not
be
left
fasting
all
the
day
but
herein
we
miscalculated
the
potency
of
liquor
and
a
comfortable
bed
of
hay
for
was
nine
before
either
of
us
winked
an
eye
and
when
we
got
down
we
learnt
that
don
sanchez
had
been
gone
a
full
hour
and
so
no
prospect
of
breaking
our
fast
till
nightfall
presently
comes
moll
all
fresh
and
pink
from
the
house
and
falls
to
exclaiming
upon
the
joy
of
sleeping
betwixt
clean
sheets
in
a
feather
bed
and
could
speak
of
nothing
else
saying
she
would
give
all
the
world
to
sleep
so
well
every
day
of
her
life
eh
whispers
her
father
in
my
ear
you
see
how
luxuries
do
tempt
the
poor
child
and
what
kind
of
a
bed
she
is
like
to
lie
in
if
our
hopes
miscarry
on
which
still
holding
to
my
scruples
i
says
to
moll
is
easy
to
say
you
would
give
the
world
moll
but
i
know
full
well
you
would
give
nothing
for
all
the
comfort
possible
that
was
not
your
own
nay
says
she
crossing
her
hands
on
her
breast
and
casting
up
her
eyes
with
the
look
of
a
saint
what
are
all
the
fruits
of
the
earth
to
her
who
can
not
take
them
with
an
easy
conscience
honesty
is
dearer
to
me
than
the
bread
of
life
then
as
jack
and
i
are
looking
at
each
other
ruefully
in
the
face
at
this
dash
to
our
knavish
project
she
bursts
into
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
like
a
set
of
christmas
bells
chiming
whereupon
we
turning
about
to
find
the
cause
of
her
merriment
she
pulls
another
demure
face
and
slowly
lifting
her
skirt
shows
us
a
white
napkin
tied
about
her
waist
stuffed
with
a
dozen
delicacies
she
had
filched
from
don
sanchez
table
in
coming
down
from
her
room
chapter
iv
the
several
parts
that
we
are
appointed
to
finding
a
sheltered
secret
corner
we
made
a
very
hasty
breakfast
of
these
stolen
dainties
and
since
we
had
not
the
heart
to
restore
them
to
our
innkeeper
so
we
had
not
the
face
to
chide
moll
for
her
larceny
but
made
light
of
the
business
and
ate
with
great
content
and
some
mirth
a
drizzly
rain
falling
and
turning
the
snow
into
slush
we
kept
under
the
shelter
of
the
shed
and
this
giving
us
scope
for
the
reflection
don
sanchez
had
counselled
my
compunctions
were
greatly
shaken
by
the
consideration
of
our
present
position
and
the
prospect
of
worse
when
i
thought
of
our
breakfast
that
moll
had
stolen
and
how
willingly
we
would
all
have
eaten
a
dinner
got
by
the
same
means
i
had
to
acknowledge
that
certainly
we
were
all
thieves
at
heart
and
this
conclusion
together
with
sitting
all
day
doing
nothing
in
the
raw
cold
did
make
the
design
of
don
sanchez
seem
much
less
heinous
to
me
than
it
appeared
the
night
before
when
i
was
warm
and
not
exceedingly
sober
and
indeed
towards
dusk
i
came
to
regard
it
as
no
bad
thing
at
all
about
six
comes
back
our
don
on
a
fine
horse
and
receives
our
salutations
with
a
cool
nod
we
standing
there
of
a
row
looking
our
sweetest
like
hungry
dogs
in
expectation
of
a
bone
then
in
he
goes
to
the
house
without
a
word
and
now
my
worst
fear
was
that
he
had
thought
better
of
his
offer
and
would
abandon
it
so
there
we
hang
about
the
best
part
of
an
hour
now
thinking
the
don
would
presently
send
for
us
and
then
growing
to
despair
of
everything
but
to
be
left
in
the
cold
forgotten
but
in
the
end
comes
master
landlord
to
tell
us
his
worship
in
the
cherry
room
would
see
us
so
after
the
same
formalities
of
cleansing
ourselves
as
the
night
afore
upstairs
we
go
at
the
heels
of
a
drawer
carrying
a
roast
pig
which
to
our
senses
was
more
delightful
than
any
bunch
of
flowers
with
a
gesture
of
his
hands
after
saluting
us
with
great
dignity
don
sanchez
bade
us
take
our
places
at
the
table
and
with
never
a
word
of
question
as
to
our
decision
but
that
was
scarce
necessary
for
it
needed
no
subtle
observation
to
perceive
that
we
would
accept
any
conditions
to
get
our
share
of
that
roast
pig
this
supper
differed
not
greatly
from
the
former
save
that
our
moll
was
taken
with
a
kind
of
tickling
at
the
throat
which
presently
attracted
our
notice
what
ails
you
molly
my
dear
asks
jack
has
a
bit
of
crackling
gone
down
the
wrong
way
she
put
it
off
as
if
she
would
have
us
take
no
notice
of
it
but
it
grew
worse
and
worse
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
and
became
a
most
horrid
tearing
cough
which
she
did
so
natural
as
to
deceive
us
all
and
put
us
in
great
concern
and
especially
don
sanchez
who
declared
she
must
have
taken
a
cold
by
being
exposed
all
day
to
the
damp
weather
if
i
have
says
she
very
prettily
after
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
upon
another
fit
is
surely
a
most
ungrateful
return
for
the
kindness
with
which
you
sheltered
me
last
night
señor
i
shall
take
better
care
to
shelter
you
in
the
future
my
poor
child
replies
the
don
ringing
the
bell
then
the
maid
coming
he
bids
her
warm
a
bed
and
prepare
a
hot
posset
against
moll
was
tucked
up
in
the
blankets
and
says
he
turning
to
moll
you
shall
not
rise
till
noon
my
dear
your
breakfast
shall
be
brought
to
you
in
your
room
where
a
fire
shall
be
made
and
such
treatment
shown
you
as
if
you
were
my
own
child
oh
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
be
so
gentle
to
me
exclaims
moll
smothering
another
cough
and
with
that
she
reaches
out
her
leg
under
the
table
and
fetches
me
a
kick
of
the
shin
looking
all
the
while
as
pitiful
and
innocent
as
any
painted
picture
would
it
be
well
to
fetch
in
a
doctor
says
don
sanchez
when
moll
was
gone
barking
upstairs
the
child
looks
delicate
though
she
eats
with
a
fairly
good
appetite
is
nothing
serious
replies
jack
who
had
doubtless
received
the
same
hint
from
moll
she
had
given
me
i
warrant
she
will
be
mended
in
a
day
or
so
with
proper
care
is
a
kind
of
family
complaint
i
am
taken
that
way
at
times
and
with
that
he
rasps
his
throat
as
a
hint
that
he
would
be
none
the
worse
for
sleeping
a
night
between
sheets
this
was
carrying
the
matter
too
far
and
i
thought
it
had
certainly
undone
us
for
stopping
short
with
a
start
in
crossing
the
room
he
turns
and
looks
first
at
dawson
then
at
me
with
anything
but
a
pleasant
look
in
his
eyes
as
finding
his
dignity
hurt
to
be
thus
bustled
by
a
mere
child
then
his
dark
eyebrows
unbending
with
the
reflection
maybe
that
it
was
so
much
the
better
to
his
purpose
that
moll
could
so
act
as
to
deceive
him
he
seats
himself
gravely
and
replies
to
jack
your
family
wit
may
get
you
a
night
lodging
but
i
doubt
if
you
will
ever
merit
it
so
well
as
your
daughter
well
says
jack
with
a
laugh
what
wit
we
have
amongst
us
we
are
resolved
to
employ
in
your
honour
service
so
that
you
show
us
this
is
a
rascal
that
deserves
to
be
bounced
and
we
do
no
great
injury
to
any
one
else
good
says
don
sanchez
we
will
proceed
to
that
without
delay
and
now
as
we
have
no
matter
to
discuss
and
must
be
afoot
early
i
will
ring
for
a
light
to
take
you
to
bed
so
we
up
presently
to
a
good
snug
room
with
a
bed
to
each
of
us
fit
for
a
prince
and
there
with
the
blankets
drawn
up
to
our
ears
we
fell
blessing
our
stars
that
we
were
now
fairly
out
of
our
straits
and
after
that
to
discussing
whether
we
should
consult
moll
inclination
to
this
business
first
dawson
was
for
telling
her
plump
out
all
about
our
project
saying
that
being
so
young
she
had
no
conscience
to
speak
of
and
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
take
part
in
any
piece
of
mischief
but
against
this
i
protested
seeing
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
our
design
to
let
her
know
so
much
she
having
a
tongue
in
her
head
and
also
of
a
bad
tendency
to
make
her
as
it
were
at
the
very
beginning
of
her
life
a
knowing
active
party
to
what
looked
like
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
piece
of
knavery
therefore
i
proposed
we
should
when
necessary
tell
her
just
so
much
of
our
plan
as
was
expedient
and
no
more
and
this
agreeing
mightily
with
jack
natural
turn
for
taking
of
short
cuts
out
of
difficulties
he
fell
in
with
my
views
at
once
and
so
bidding
god
bless
me
he
lays
the
clothes
over
his
head
and
was
snoring
the
next
minute
in
the
morning
we
found
the
don
just
as
kind
to
us
as
the
day
before
he
had
been
careless
and
so
made
us
eat
breakfast
with
him
to
our
great
content
also
he
sent
a
maid
up
to
moll
to
enquire
of
her
health
and
if
she
could
eat
anything
from
our
table
to
which
the
baggage
sends
reply
that
she
feels
a
little
easier
this
morning
and
could
fancy
a
dish
of
black
puddings
these
delicacies
her
father
carried
to
her
being
charged
by
the
don
to
tell
her
that
we
should
be
gone
for
a
couple
of
days
and
that
in
our
absence
she
might
command
whatever
she
felt
was
necessary
to
her
complete
recovery
against
our
return
then
i
told
don
sanchez
how
we
had
resolved
to
tell
moll
no
more
of
our
purpose
than
was
necessary
for
the
moment
which
pleased
him
i
thought
mightily
he
saying
that
our
success
or
failure
depended
upon
secrecy
as
much
as
anything
for
which
reason
he
had
kept
us
in
the
dark
as
much
as
ever
it
was
possible
about
eight
three
saddle
nags
were
brought
to
the
door
and
we
mounting
set
out
for
london
where
we
arrived
about
ten
the
roads
being
fairly
passable
save
in
the
marshy
parts
about
shoreditch
where
the
mire
was
so
to
gracious
street
and
there
leaving
our
nags
at
the
turk
inn
we
walked
down
to
the
bridge
stairs
and
thence
with
a
pair
of
oars
to
greenwich
here
after
our
tedious
chilly
voyage
we
were
not
to
see
the
inside
of
an
inn
once
more
and
don
sanchez
taking
us
to
the
king
orders
a
fire
to
be
lighted
in
a
private
room
and
the
best
there
was
in
the
larder
to
be
served
us
in
the
warm
parlour
while
we
were
at
our
trenchers
don
sanchez
says
at
two
two
men
are
coming
hither
to
see
me
one
is
a
master
mariner
named
robert
evans
the
other
a
merchant
adventurer
of
his
acquaintance
whom
i
have
not
yet
seen
now
you
are
to
mark
these
two
men
well
note
all
they
say
and
their
manner
of
speaking
for
you
will
have
to
personate
these
characters
before
one
who
would
be
only
too
glad
to
find
you
at
fault
very
good
señor
says
dawson
but
which
of
these
parts
am
i
to
play
that
you
may
decide
when
you
have
seen
the
men
but
i
should
say
from
my
knowledge
of
robert
evans
that
you
may
best
represent
his
character
for
in
your
parts
you
are
to
be
john
and
christopher
knight
two
needy
cousins
of
lady
godwin
whose
husband
sir
richard
godwin
was
lost
at
sea
seven
years
ago
i
doubt
if
you
will
have
to
do
anything
in
these
characters
beyond
looking
eager
and
answering
merely
yes
and
no
to
such
questions
as
i
may
put
thus
primed
we
went
presently
to
the
above
and
the
drawer
shortly
after
coming
to
say
that
two
gentlemen
desired
to
see
don
sanchez
jack
and
i
seated
ourselves
side
by
side
at
a
becoming
distance
from
the
don
holding
our
hats
on
our
knees
as
humbly
as
may
be
then
in
comes
a
rude
dirty
fellow
with
a
patch
over
one
eye
and
a
most
peculiar
bearish
gait
dressed
in
a
tarred
coat
with
a
wool
shawl
about
his
neck
followed
by
a
little
gentleman
in
a
plain
cloth
suit
but
of
very
good
substance
he
looking
just
as
trim
and
as
was
uncouth
and
rude
well
here
am
i
says
evans
whom
we
knew
at
once
for
the
master
mariner
flinging
his
hat
and
shawl
in
a
corner
there
his
excellency
don
sanchez
and
here
hopkins
the
merchant
i
spoke
on
yesterday
and
who
be
these
turning
about
to
fix
us
with
his
one
blue
eye
two
gentlemen
related
to
godwin
and
very
anxious
for
her
return
replies
the
don
then
we
being
met
friends
all
let
have
up
a
bottle
and
heave
off
on
this
here
business
without
more
ado
says
evans
and
with
that
he
seats
himself
in
the
don
chair
pokes
up
the
fire
with
his
boots
and
spits
on
the
hearth
the
don
graciously
places
a
chair
for
hopkins
rings
the
bell
and
seats
himself
then
after
a
few
civilities
while
the
bottle
was
being
opened
and
our
glasses
filled
he
says
you
have
doubtless
heard
from
robert
evans
the
purpose
of
our
coming
hither
mr
hopkins
roughly
replies
hopkins
with
a
dry
little
cough
but
i
should
be
glad
to
have
the
particulars
from
you
that
i
may
judge
more
clearly
of
my
responsibilities
in
this
undertaking
oh
lord
exclaims
evans
in
disgust
here
give
us
a
pipe
of
tobacco
if
we
to
warp
out
half
a
day
ere
we
get
a
capful
of
wind
chapter
sanchez
puts
us
in
the
way
of
robbing
with
an
easy
promising
to
make
his
story
as
short
as
he
possibly
could
don
sanchez
began
on
the
coming
of
our
present
king
to
his
throne
sir
richard
godwin
was
recalled
from
italy
whither
he
had
been
sent
as
embassador
by
the
protector
he
sailed
from
livorno
with
his
wife
and
his
daughter
judith
a
child
of
nine
years
old
at
that
time
in
the
seahawk
i
remember
her
says
evans
as
stout
a
ship
as
ever
was
put
to
sea
on
the
second
night
of
her
voyage
the
seahawk
became
parted
from
her
convoy
and
the
next
day
she
was
pursued
and
overtaken
by
a
pair
of
barbary
pirates
to
whom
she
gave
battle
aye
and
i
have
done
the
same
cries
evans
though
they
had
been
a
score
after
a
long
and
bloody
fight
continues
don
sanchez
the
corsairs
succeeded
in
boarding
the
seahawk
and
overcoming
the
remnant
of
her
company
poor
hearts
would
i
had
been
there
to
help
says
evans
exasperated
by
the
obstinate
resistance
of
these
english
and
their
own
losses
the
pirates
would
grant
no
mercy
but
tying
the
living
to
the
dead
they
cast
all
overboard
save
godwin
and
her
daughter
her
lot
was
even
worse
for
her
wounded
husband
sir
richard
was
snatched
from
her
arms
and
flung
into
the
sea
before
her
eyes
and
he
sank
crying
farewell
to
her
these
turks
have
no
hearts
in
their
bellies
you
must
understand
explains
evans
and
nought
but
venom
in
their
veins
the
seahawk
was
taken
to
alger
and
there
godwin
and
her
daughter
were
sold
for
slaves
in
the
public
i
have
seen
sold
by
the
score
there
says
evans
and
fetch
but
an
onion
a
head
by
good
fortune
the
mother
and
daughter
were
bought
by
sidi
ben
moula
a
rich
old
merchant
who
was
smitten
by
the
pretty
delicate
looks
of
judith
whom
he
thenceforth
treated
as
if
she
had
been
his
own
child
in
this
condition
they
lived
with
greater
happiness
than
falls
to
the
lot
of
most
slaves
until
the
beginning
of
last
year
when
sidi
died
and
his
possessions
fell
to
his
brother
bare
ben
moula
then
godwin
appeals
to
bare
for
her
liberty
and
to
be
sent
home
to
her
country
saying
that
what
price
in
reason
he
chooses
to
set
upon
their
heads
she
will
pay
from
her
estate
in
england
a
thing
which
she
had
proposed
before
to
sidi
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
because
of
his
love
for
judith
and
his
needing
no
greater
fortune
than
he
had
but
this
bare
though
he
would
be
very
well
content
being
also
an
old
man
to
have
his
household
managed
by
godwin
and
to
adopt
judith
as
his
child
being
of
a
more
avaricious
turn
than
his
brother
at
length
consents
to
it
on
condition
that
her
ransoms
be
paid
before
she
quits
barbary
and
so
casting
about
how
this
may
be
done
godwin
finds
a
captive
whose
price
has
been
paid
about
to
be
taken
to
palma
in
the
baleares
and
to
him
she
entrusts
two
letters
here
don
sanchez
pulls
two
folded
sheets
of
vellum
from
his
pocket
and
presenting
one
to
me
he
says
mayhap
you
recognise
this
hand
mr
knight
and
i
seeing
the
signature
elizabeth
godwin
answers
quickly
enough
aye
is
my
dear
cousin
bess
her
own
hand
this
says
the
don
handing
the
other
to
evans
you
may
understand
i
can
make
out
is
writ
in
the
moorish
style
says
evans
but
the
meaning
of
it
i
know
not
for
i
ca
tell
great
a
from
a
bull
foot
though
it
be
in
printed
english
is
an
undertaking
on
the
part
of
bare
ben
moula
says
the
don
to
deliver
up
at
dellys
in
barbary
the
persons
of
godwin
and
her
daughter
against
the
payment
of
five
thousand
gold
ducats
within
one
year
the
other
writing
tells
its
own
story
hopkins
took
the
first
sheet
from
me
and
read
it
aloud
it
was
addressed
to
richard
godwin
hurst
court
chislehurst
in
kent
and
after
giving
such
particulars
of
her
past
as
we
had
already
heard
from
don
sanchez
she
writes
thus
and
now
my
dear
nephew
as
i
doubt
not
you
as
the
nearest
of
my
kindred
to
my
dear
husband
after
us
two
poor
relicts
have
taken
possession
of
his
estate
in
the
belief
we
were
all
lost
in
our
voyage
from
italy
i
do
pray
you
for
the
love
of
god
and
of
mercy
to
deliver
us
from
our
bondage
by
sending
hither
a
ship
with
the
money
for
our
ransoms
forthwith
and
be
assured
by
this
that
i
shall
not
dispossess
you
of
your
fortune
more
than
my
bitter
circumstances
do
now
require
so
that
i
but
come
home
to
die
in
a
christian
country
and
have
my
sweet
judith
where
she
may
be
less
exposed
to
harm
than
in
this
infidel
country
i
count
upon
your
love
being
ever
a
dear
nephew
and
am
your
most
hopeful
trusting
and
loving
aunt
elizabeth
godwin
very
well
sir
says
hopkins
returning
the
letter
you
have
been
to
chislehurst
i
have
answers
the
don
and
there
i
find
the
estate
in
the
hands
of
a
most
curious
puritanical
steward
whose
honesty
is
rather
in
the
letter
than
the
spirit
for
though
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
not
one
penny
value
of
the
estate
has
been
misemployed
since
it
has
been
in
his
hands
yet
will
he
give
nothing
no
not
a
maravedi
to
the
redemption
of
his
mistress
saying
that
the
letter
is
addressed
to
richard
godwin
and
not
to
him
and
that
he
hath
no
power
to
pay
out
monies
for
this
purpose
even
though
he
believed
the
facts
i
have
laid
before
him
which
for
his
own
ends
doubtless
he
fains
to
misdoubt
as
a
trader
sir
says
hopkins
i
can
not
blame
his
conduct
in
that
respect
for
should
the
venture
fall
through
the
next
heir
might
call
upon
him
to
repay
out
of
his
own
pocket
all
that
he
had
put
into
this
enterprise
but
this
richard
godwin
what
of
him
he
is
nowhere
to
be
found
the
only
relatives
i
have
been
able
to
discover
are
these
two
gentlemen
who
remarks
hopkins
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
our
soiled
clothes
are
not
i
venture
to
think
in
a
position
to
pay
their
ransom
alas
no
sir
says
jack
we
are
but
two
poor
shopkeepers
of
london
undone
by
the
great
fire
well
now
sir
says
hopkins
fetching
an
inkpot
a
pen
and
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
i
may
conclude
that
you
wish
me
to
adventure
upon
the
redemption
of
these
two
ladies
in
barbary
upon
the
hazard
of
being
repaid
by
godwin
when
she
recovers
her
estate
and
the
don
making
him
a
reverence
he
continues
we
must
first
learn
the
extent
of
our
liabilities
what
sum
is
to
be
paid
to
bare
ben
moula
five
thousand
gold
ducats
about
two
thousand
pounds
english
two
thousand
says
hopkins
writing
then
robert
evans
what
charge
is
yours
for
fetching
the
ladies
from
dellys
master
hopkins
i
have
said
fifteen
hundred
pounds
says
he
and
i
wo
go
from
my
word
though
all
laugh
at
me
for
a
madman
that
seems
a
great
deal
of
money
says
hopkins
well
if
you
think
fifteen
hundred
pounds
too
much
for
my
carcase
and
a
ship
of
twenty
men
you
can
go
seek
a
cheaper
market
elsewhere
you
think
there
is
very
small
likelihood
of
coming
back
alive
why
comrade
is
as
if
you
should
go
into
a
den
of
lions
and
hope
to
get
out
whole
for
though
i
have
the
duke
pass
these
moors
are
no
fitter
to
be
trusted
than
a
sackful
of
serpents
is
ten
to
one
our
ship
be
taken
and
we
fools
all
sold
into
slavery
ten
to
one
says
hopkins
that
is
to
say
you
would
make
this
voyage
for
the
tenth
part
of
what
you
ask
were
you
sure
of
returning
safe
i
would
go
as
far
anywhere
outside
the
straits
for
an
hundred
pounds
with
a
lighter
heart
hopkins
nods
his
head
and
setting
down
some
figures
on
his
paper
says
the
bare
outlay
in
hard
money
amounts
to
hundred
pounds
reckoning
the
risk
at
robert
evans
own
valuation
which
i
take
to
be
a
very
low
one
i
must
see
reasonable
prospect
of
winning
thousand
pounds
by
my
hazard
godwin
estate
i
know
to
be
worth
double
that
amount
but
who
will
promise
me
that
return
asks
hopkins
not
you
the
don
shook
his
head
not
you
turning
to
us
with
the
same
result
not
godwin
for
we
have
no
means
of
communicating
with
her
not
the
steward
you
have
shown
me
that
who
then
remains
but
this
richard
godwin
who
can
not
be
found
if
adds
he
getting
up
from
his
seat
you
can
find
richard
godwin
put
him
in
possession
of
the
estate
and
obtain
from
him
a
reasonable
promise
that
this
sum
shall
be
paid
on
the
return
of
godwin
i
may
feel
disposed
to
consider
your
proposal
more
seriously
but
till
then
i
can
do
nothing
likewise
masters
all
says
evans
fetching
his
hat
and
shawl
from
the
corner
i
ca
wait
for
a
blue
moon
and
if
so
be
we
do
sign
articles
in
a
week
i
off
of
my
bargain
and
mighty
glad
to
get
out
of
it
so
cheap
you
see
says
don
sanchez
when
they
were
gone
out
of
the
room
how
impossible
it
is
that
godwin
and
her
daughter
shall
be
redeemed
from
captivity
i
shall
show
you
what
kind
of
a
fellow
the
steward
is
that
he
should
have
the
handling
of
this
fortune
rather
than
we
then
presently
with
an
indifferent
careless
air
as
if
was
nought
he
gives
us
a
purse
and
bids
us
go
out
in
the
town
to
furnish
ourselves
with
what
disguise
was
necessary
to
our
purpose
therewith
dawson
gets
him
some
seaman
old
clothes
at
a
jew
and
i
a
very
neat
presentable
suit
of
cloth
and
the
rest
of
the
money
we
take
back
to
don
sanchez
without
taking
so
much
as
a
penny
for
our
other
uses
but
he
doing
all
things
very
magnificent
would
have
none
of
it
but
bade
us
keep
it
against
our
other
necessities
and
now
having
his
money
in
our
pockets
we
felt
be
more
dishonest
to
go
back
from
this
business
than
to
go
forward
with
it
lead
us
whither
it
might
next
morning
off
we
go
betimes
jack
more
like
robert
evans
than
his
mother
son
and
i
a
most
seeming
substantial
man
so
that
the
very
stable
lad
took
off
his
hat
to
me
and
on
very
good
horses
a
long
ride
to
chislehurst
and
there
coming
to
a
monstrous
fine
park
don
sanchez
stayed
us
before
the
gates
and
bidding
us
look
up
a
broad
avenue
of
great
oaks
to
a
most
surprising
brave
house
he
told
us
this
was
hurst
court
and
we
might
have
it
for
our
own
within
a
year
if
we
were
so
minded
hence
at
no
great
distance
we
reach
a
square
plain
house
the
windows
all
barred
with
stout
iron
and
the
most
like
a
prison
i
did
ever
see
here
don
sanchez
ringing
a
bell
a
little
grating
in
the
door
is
opened
and
after
some
parley
we
are
admitted
by
a
sturdy
fellow
carrying
a
cudgel
in
his
hand
so
we
into
a
cold
room
with
not
a
spark
of
fire
on
the
hearth
but
a
few
ashes
no
hangings
to
the
windows
nor
any
ornament
or
comfort
at
all
but
only
a
table
and
half
a
dozen
wooden
stools
and
a
number
of
shelves
against
the
wall
full
of
account
books
and
papers
protected
by
a
grating
of
stout
wire
secured
with
sundry
padlocks
and
here
behind
a
tableful
of
papers
sat
our
steward
simon
a
most
withered
lean
old
man
clothed
all
in
leather
wearing
no
wig
but
his
own
rusty
grey
hair
falling
lank
on
his
shoulders
with
a
sour
face
of
a
very
jaundiced
complexion
and
pale
eyes
that
seemed
to
swim
in
a
yellowish
rheum
which
he
was
for
ever
with
a
rag
i
am
come
mr
steward
says
don
sanchez
to
conclude
the
business
we
were
upon
last
week
aye
cries
dawson
for
all
the
world
in
the
manner
of
evans
but
ere
we
get
to
this
dry
matter
let
have
a
bottle
to
ease
the
way
for
this
riding
of
horseback
has
parched
up
my
vitals
confoundedly
if
thou
art
athirst
says
simon
peter
shall
fetch
thee
a
jug
of
water
from
the
well
but
other
liquor
have
we
none
in
this
house
let
peter
drown
in
your
well
says
dawson
with
an
oath
i
have
none
of
it
let
get
this
matter
done
and
away
for
i
as
lief
sit
in
a
leaky
hold
as
in
this
here
place
for
comfort
here
says
don
sanchez
is
a
master
mariner
who
is
prepared
to
risk
his
life
and
here
a
merchant
adventurer
of
london
who
will
hazard
his
money
to
redeem
your
mistress
and
her
daughter
from
slavery
praise
the
lord
peter
says
the
steward
whereupon
the
sturdy
fellow
with
the
cudgel
fell
upon
his
knees
as
likewise
did
simon
and
both
in
a
snuffling
voice
render
thanks
to
heaven
in
words
which
i
do
not
think
it
proper
to
write
here
then
being
done
they
get
up
and
the
steward
having
dried
his
eyes
says
so
far
our
prayers
have
been
answered
put
me
in
mind
friend
peter
that
we
pray
these
worthy
men
prosper
in
their
design
if
they
succeed
says
don
sanchez
it
will
cost
your
mistress
thousand
pounds
the
steward
clutched
at
the
table
as
if
at
the
fortune
about
to
turn
from
him
his
jaw
fell
and
he
stared
at
don
sanchez
in
bewilderment
then
getting
the
face
to
speak
he
gasps
out
thousand
pounds
and
still
in
a
maze
asks
art
thou
in
thy
right
senses
friend
the
don
hunches
his
shoulders
and
turns
to
me
whereupon
i
lay
forth
in
pretty
much
the
same
words
as
hopkins
used
the
risk
of
the
venture
to
all
which
this
simon
listened
with
starting
eyes
and
gaping
mouth
thousand
pounds
he
says
again
why
friend
is
half
of
all
i
have
made
of
the
estate
by
a
life
of
thrift
and
care
and
earnest
seeking
is
in
your
power
simon
says
don
sanchez
to
spare
your
mistress
this
terrible
charge
for
which
your
fine
park
must
be
felled
your
farms
cut
up
and
your
economies
be
scattered
the
master
here
will
fetch
your
mistress
home
for
fifteen
hundred
pounds
why
even
that
is
an
extortion
nay
says
jack
if
you
think
fifteen
hundred
pounds
too
much
for
my
carcase
and
a
ship
of
twenty
men
you
may
seek
a
cheaper
market
and
welcome
for
i
no
stomach
to
risk
my
life
and
property
for
less
to
the
fifteen
hundred
pounds
you
must
add
the
ransom
of
two
thousand
pounds
thus
godwin
and
her
daughter
may
be
redeemed
for
hundred
pounds
to
her
saving
of
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
says
the
don
and
here
dawson
and
i
were
secretly
struck
by
his
honesty
in
not
seeking
to
affright
the
steward
from
an
honest
course
but
rather
tempting
him
to
it
by
playing
upon
his
parsimony
and
avarice
three
thousand
five
hundred
says
simon
putting
it
down
in
writing
that
he
might
the
better
realise
his
position
but
you
say
friend
merchant
that
the
risk
is
as
ten
to
one
against
seeing
thy
money
again
i
will
run
the
risk
for
thousand
pounds
and
no
less
says
i
but
if
it
may
be
done
for
a
tenth
part
how
then
why
is
your
risk
sir
and
not
mine
says
i
yea
yea
my
risk
and
you
tell
me
friend
sailor
that
you
stand
in
danger
of
being
plundered
by
these
infidels
aye
more
like
than
not
why
then
we
may
count
half
the
estate
gone
and
the
peril
is
to
be
run
again
and
thus
all
cast
away
for
nought
in
this
manner
did
simon
halt
betwixt
two
ways
like
one
distracted
but
only
he
did
mingle
a
mass
of
sacred
words
with
his
arguments
which
seemed
to
me
nought
but
profanity
his
sole
concern
being
the
gain
of
money
then
he
falls
to
the
old
excuses
don
sanchez
had
told
us
of
saying
he
had
no
money
of
his
own
and
offering
to
show
his
books
that
we
might
see
he
had
taken
not
one
penny
beyond
his
bare
expenses
from
the
estate
save
his
yearly
wage
and
that
no
more
than
sir
richard
had
given
him
in
his
lifetime
and
on
don
sanchez
showing
letter
as
a
fitting
authority
to
draw
out
this
money
for
her
use
he
first
feigns
to
doubt
her
hand
and
then
says
he
if
an
accident
befalls
these
two
women
ere
they
return
to
justify
me
how
shall
i
answer
to
the
next
heir
for
this
outlay
verily
clasping
his
hands
i
am
as
one
standing
in
darkness
and
i
dare
not
move
until
i
am
better
enlightened
so
prithee
friend
give
me
time
to
commune
with
my
conscience
don
sanchez
hunches
up
his
shoulders
and
turns
to
us
why
look
here
master
says
dawson
i
ca
see
as
you
need
much
enlightenment
to
answer
yes
or
no
to
a
fair
offer
and
as
for
me
not
going
to
hang
in
a
hedge
for
a
blue
moon
so
if
you
wo
clap
hands
on
the
bargain
without
more
ado
i
throw
this
business
overboard
and
shall
count
i
done
the
best
day
work
of
my
life
in
getting
out
of
the
affair
then
i
made
as
if
i
would
willingly
draw
out
of
my
share
in
the
project
my
friends
says
simon
there
can
be
scarce
any
hope
at
all
if
thou
wilt
not
hazard
thy
money
for
such
a
prodigious
advantage
then
turning
to
peter
as
his
last
hope
he
asks
in
despair
what
shall
we
do
my
brother
we
can
keep
on
friend
simon
replies
peter
in
a
snivelling
voice
a
blessed
thought
exclaims
the
steward
in
glee
surely
that
is
more
righteous
than
to
lay
faith
in
our
own
vain
effort
so
do
thou
friend
turning
to
me
put
thy
money
to
this
use
for
i
will
none
i
can
not
do
that
sir
says
i
without
an
assurance
that
godwin
estate
will
bear
this
charge
with
wondrous
alacrity
simon
fetches
a
book
with
a
plan
of
the
estate
whereby
he
showed
us
that
not
a
holding
on
the
estate
was
untenanted
not
a
single
tenant
in
arrear
with
his
rent
and
that
the
value
of
the
property
with
all
deductions
made
was
thousand
pounds
very
good
sir
says
i
now
you
must
give
me
a
written
note
stating
what
you
have
shown
with
your
sanction
to
my
making
this
venture
on
godwin
behalf
that
i
may
justify
my
claim
hereafter
but
this
simon
stoutly
refused
to
do
saying
his
conscience
would
not
allow
him
to
sign
any
bond
clearly
with
the
hope
that
he
might
in
the
end
shuffle
out
of
paying
anything
at
all
until
don
sanchez
losing
patience
declared
he
would
certainly
hunt
all
london
through
to
find
that
richard
godwin
who
was
the
next
of
kin
hinting
that
he
would
certainly
give
us
such
sanction
as
we
required
if
only
to
prove
his
right
to
the
succession
should
our
venture
fail
this
put
the
steward
to
a
new
taking
but
the
don
holding
firm
he
at
length
agreed
to
give
us
this
note
upon
don
sanchez
writing
another
affirming
that
he
had
seen
godwin
and
her
daughter
in
barbary
and
was
going
forth
to
fetch
them
that
should
richard
godwin
come
to
claim
the
estate
he
might
be
justly
put
off
and
so
this
business
ended
to
our
great
satisfaction
we
saying
to
ourselves
that
we
had
done
all
that
man
could
to
redeem
the
captives
and
that
it
would
be
no
harm
at
all
to
put
a
cheat
upon
the
miserly
steward
whether
we
were
any
way
more
honest
than
he
in
shaping
our
conduct
according
to
our
inclinations
is
a
question
which
troubled
us
then
very
little
chapter
vi
is
cast
to
play
the
part
of
a
fine
lady
doubtful
promise
for
this
on
our
way
back
to
greenwich
we
stayed
at
an
inn
by
the
road
to
refresh
ourselves
and
there
having
a
snug
parlour
to
ourselves
and
being
seated
about
a
fine
cheese
with
each
a
full
measure
of
ale
don
sanchez
asks
us
if
we
are
satisfied
with
our
undertaking
aye
that
we
are
replies
dawson
mightily
pleased
as
usual
to
be
we
desire
nothing
better
than
to
serve
your
honour
faithfully
in
all
ways
and
are
ready
to
put
our
hands
to
any
bond
you
may
choose
to
draw
up
can
you
show
me
the
man
asks
the
don
lifting
his
eyebrows
contemptuously
who
ever
kept
a
treaty
he
was
minded
to
break
men
are
honest
enough
when
nought
to
be
gained
by
breaking
faith
are
you
both
agreed
to
this
course
yes
señor
says
i
and
my
only
compunction
now
is
that
i
can
do
so
little
to
forward
this
business
why
so
far
as
i
can
see
into
it
says
dawson
one
of
us
must
be
cast
for
old
godwin
if
moll
is
to
be
her
daughter
and
you
fitter
to
play
the
part
than
i
for
i
take
it
this
old
gentlewoman
should
be
of
a
more
delicate
sickly
composition
than
mine
we
will
suppose
that
godwin
is
dead
says
the
don
gravely
aye
to
be
sure
that
simplifies
the
thing
mightily
but
pray
señor
what
parts
are
we
to
play
the
parts
you
have
played
you
go
with
me
to
fetch
judith
godwin
from
barbary
this
hangs
together
and
ought
to
play
well
eh
kit
i
asked
don
sanchez
how
long
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
an
expedition
of
this
kind
would
take
that
depends
upon
accidents
of
many
kinds
answers
he
we
may
very
well
stretch
it
out
best
part
of
a
year
a
year
says
jack
scratching
his
ear
ruefully
for
i
believe
he
had
counted
upon
coming
to
live
like
a
lord
in
a
few
weeks
and
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
in
the
meanwhile
teach
moll
answers
the
don
she
can

this
it
is
not
sufficient
merely
to
obtain

of

it

judith

probably

why

can
play

as
well
as
he
but
above
all
continues
the
don
as
taking
no
heed
of
this
tribute

for
some
months
god
have
mercy
on
us
cries
jack
your
honour
is
not
for
taking
us
to
barbary
no
answers
the
don
dryly
passing
his
long
fingers
with
some
significance
over
the
many
seams
in
his
long
face
but
we
must
go
where
the
moors
are
to
be
found
on
the
hither
side
of
the
straits
well
says
dawson
all
as
one
whither
we
go
in
safety
if
we
to
be
out
of
our
fortune
for
a
year
there
nothing
more
for
our
moll
to
learn
i
suppose
señor
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
teach
her
the
manners
of
a
lady
replies
the
don
rising
and
knitting
his
brows
together
unpleasantly
and
especially
to
keep
her
feet
under
her
chair
at
table
with
this
he
rings
the
bell
for
our
reckoning
and
so
ends
our
discussion
neither
dawson
nor
i
having
a
word
to
say
in
answer
to
this
last
hit
which
showed
us
pretty
plainly
that
in
reaching
round
with
her
long
leg
for
our
shins
moll
had
caught
the
don
shanks
a
kick
that
night
she
was
seized
with
a
cough
so
to
horse
again
and
a
long
jog
back
to
greenwich
where
dawson
and
i
would
fain
have
rested
the
night
being
unused
to
the
saddle
and
very
raw
with
our
journey
but
the
don
would
not
for
prudence
and
therefore
after
changing
our
clothes
we
make
a
shift
to
mount
once
more
and
thence
another
long
horrid
jolt
to
edmonton
very
painfully
coming
to
the
bell
more
dead
than
alive
about
eight
and
pitch
dark
we
were
greatly
surprised
that
we
could
make
no
one
hear
to
take
our
horses
and
further
having
turned
the
brutes
into
the
stable
ourselves
to
find
never
a
soul
in
the
common
room
or
parlour
so
that
the
place
seemed
quite
forsaken
but
hearing
a
loud
guffaw
of
laughter
from
below
we
go
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
which
we
could
scarce
enter
for
the
crowd
in
the
doorway
and
here
all
darkness
save
for
a
sheet
hung
at
the
further
end
and
lit
from
behind
on
which
a
kind
of
phantasmagory
play
of
jack
and
the
giant
was
being
acted
by
shadow
characters
cut
out
of
paper
the
performer
being
hid
by
a
board
that
served
as
a
stage
for
the
puppets
and
who
should
this
performer
be
but
our
moll
as
we
knew
by
her
voice
and
most
admirably
she
did
it
setting
all
in
a
roar
one
minute
with
some
merry
joke
and
enchanting
the
next
with
a
pretty
song
for
the
maid
in
distress
we
learnt
afterwards
that
moll
who
could
never
rest
still
two
minutes
together
but
must
for
ever
be
something
new
had
cut
out
her
images
and
devised
the
show
to
entertain
the
servants
in
the
kitchen
and
that
the
guests
above
hearing
their
merriment
had
come
down
in
time
to
get
the
fag
end
which
pleased
them
so
vastly
that
they
would
have
her
play
it
all
over
again
this
may
undo
us
says
don
sanchez
in
a
low
voice
of
displeasure
drawing
us
away
here
are
a
dozen
visitors
who
will
presently
be
examining
moll
as
a
marvel
who
can
say
but
that
one
of
them
may
know
her
again
hereafter
to
our
confusion
we
must
be
seen
together
no
more
than
is
necessary
until
we
are
out
of
this
country
i
shall
leave
here
in
the
morning
and
you
will
meet
me
next
at
the
turk
in
gracious
street
afternoon
therewith
he
goes
up
to
his
room
leaving
us
to
shift
for
ourselves
and
we
into
the
parlour
to
warm
our
feet
at
the
fire
till
we
may
be
served
with
some
victuals
both
very
silent
and
surly
being
still
sore
and
as
tired
as
any
dogs
with
our
jolting
while
we
are
in
this
mood
moll
having
finished
her
play
comes
to
us
in
amazing
high
spirits
and
all
aglow
with
pleasure
shows
us
a
handful
of
silver
given
her
by
the
gentry
then
pulling
up
a
chair
betwixt
us
she
asks
us
a
dozen
questions
of
a
string
as
to
where
we
have
been
what
we
have
done
since
we
left
her
getting
no
answer
she
presently
stops
looks
first
at
one
then
at
the
other
and
bursting
into
a
fit
of
laughter
cries
why
what
ails
you
both
to
be
so
grumpy
in
the
first
place
moll
says
jack
i
have
you
to
know
that
i
am
your
father
and
will
not
be
spoken
to
save
with
becoming
respect
why
i
did
but
ask
you
where
you
have
been
children
of
your
age
should
not
ask
questions
but
do
as
they
bid
and
there
an
end
of
it
la
i
not
to
ask
any
questions
is
there
nothing
else
i
am
not
to
do
yes
i
not
have
you
playing
of
galimaufray
to
cook
wenches
and
such
stuff
i
have
you
behave
with
more
decency
take
your
feet
off
the
hearth
and
put
under
your
chair
let
me
have
no
more
of
these
why
be
said
i
can
not
give
you
a
basin
of
porridge
that
you
must
go
of
sixpences
like
this
oh
if
you
begrudge
me
a
little
cries
she
springing
up
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
i
have
none
of
it
and
with
that
she
empties
her
pocket
on
the
chair
and
out
roll
her
sixpences
together
with
a
couple
of
silver
spoons
what
cries
jack
after
glancing
round
to
see
we
were
alone
you
have
filched
a
couple
of
spoons
moll
and
why
not
asks
she
her
little
nose
turning
quite
white
with
passion
if
i
am
to
ask
no
questions
how
shall
i
know
but
we
may
have
never
a
spoon
for
your
precious
basin
of
porridge
chapter
vii
our
journey
through
france
to
a
very
horrid
pass
in
the
skipping
over
many
unimportant
particulars
of
our
leaving
edmonton
of
our
finding
don
sanchez
at
the
turk
in
gracious
street
of
our
going
thence
the
next
day
to
gravesend
of
our
preparation
there
for
voyage
i
come
now
to
our
embarking
the
march
in
the
rose
for
bordeaux
in
france
nor
shall
i
dwell
long
on
that
journey
neither
which
was
exceedingly
long
and
painful
by
reason
of
our
nearing
the
equinoctials
which
dashed
us
from
our
course
to
that
degree
that
it
was
the
before
we
reached
our
port
and
cast
anchor
in
still
water
and
all
those
days
we
were
prostrated
with
sickness
and
especially
jack
dawson
because
of
his
full
habit
so
that
he
declared
he
would
rather
ride
to
the
end
of
the
earth
than
go
another
mile
on
sea
we
stayed
in
bordeaux
which
is
a
noble
town
but
dirty
four
days
to
refresh
ourselves
and
here
the
don
lodged
us
in
a
fine
inn
and
fed
us
on
the
best
and
also
he
made
us
buy
new
clothes
and
linen
which
we
sadly
needed
after
the
pickle
we
had
lain
in
a
fortnight
and
cast
away
our
old
but
no
more
than
was
necessary
saying
be
better
to
furnish
ourselves
with
fresh
linen
as
we
needed
it
than
carry
baggage
etc
and
let
all
you
buy
be
good
goods
says
he
for
in
this
country
a
man
is
valued
at
what
he
seems
and
the
innkeepers
do
go
in
such
fear
of
their
seigneurs
that
they
will
charge
him
less
for
entertainment
than
if
he
were
a
mean
fellow
who
could
ill
afford
to
pay
so
not
to
displease
him
we
dressed
ourselves
in
the
french
fashion
more
richly
than
ever
we
had
been
clad
in
our
lives
and
especially
moll
did
profit
by
this
occasion
to
furnish
herself
like
any
duchess
so
that
dawson
and
i
drew
lots
to
decide
which
of
us
should
present
the
bill
to
don
sanchez
thinking
he
would
certainly
take
exception
to
our
extravagance
but
he
did
not
so
much
as
raise
his
eyebrows
at
the
total
but
paid
it
without
ever
a
glance
at
the
items
nay
when
moll
presents
herself
in
her
new
equipment
he
makes
her
a
low
reverence
and
pays
her
a
most
handsome
compliment
but
in
his
serious
humour
and
without
a
smile
he
himself
wore
a
new
suit
all
of
black
not
so
fine
as
ours
but
very
noble
and
becoming
by
reason
of
his
easy
graceful
manner
and
his
majestic
high
carriage
on
the
last
day
of
march
we
set
forth
for
toulouse
at
our
starting
don
sanchez
bade
moll
ride
by
his
side
and
so
we
not
being
bid
fell
behind
and
feeling
awkward
in
our
new
clothes
we
might
very
well
have
been
taken
for
their
servants
or
a
pair
of
friends
at
the
best
for
our
moll
carried
herself
not
a
whit
less
magnificent
than
the
don
to
the
admiration
of
all
who
looked
at
her
to
see
these
grand
airs
of
hers
charmed
jack
dawson
you
see
kit
whispers
he
what
an
apt
scholar
the
minx
is
and
what
an
obedient
dutiful
good
girl
one
word
from
me
is
as
good
as
six
months
schooling
for
all
this
comes
of
that
lecture
i
gave
her
the
last
night
we
were
at
edmonton
i
would
not
deny
him
the
satisfaction
of
this
belief
but
i
felt
pretty
sure
that
had
she
been
riding
betwixt
us
in
her
old
gown
instead
of
beside
the
don
as
his
daughter
all
her
father
preaching
would
not
have
stayed
her
from
behaving
herself
like
an
orange
wench
we
journey
by
easy
stages
ten
days
through
toulouse
on
the
road
to
perpignan
and
being
favoured
with
remarkably
fine
weather
a
blue
sky
and
a
bright
sun
above
us
and
at
every
turn
something
strange
or
beautiful
to
admire
no
pleasure
jaunt
in
the
world
could
have
been
more
delightful
at
every
inn
which
here
they
call
hotels
we
found
good
beds
good
food
excellent
wine
and
were
treated
like
princes
so
that
dawson
and
i
would
gladly
have
given
up
our
promise
of
a
fortune
to
have
lived
in
this
manner
to
the
end
of
our
days
but
don
sanchez
professed
to
hold
all
on
this
side
of
the
pyrenese
mountains
in
great
contempt
saying
these
hotels
were
as
nothing
to
the
spanish
posadas
that
the
people
here
would
rob
you
if
they
dared
whereas
on
side
not
a
spaniard
would
take
so
much
as
the
hair
of
your
horse
tail
though
he
were
at
the
last
extremity
that
the
food
was
not
fit
for
aught
but
a
frenchman
and
so
forth
and
our
moll
catching
this
humour
did
also
turn
up
her
nose
at
everything
she
was
offered
and
would
send
away
a
bottle
of
wine
from
the
table
because
was
not
ripe
enough
though
but
a
few
weeks
before
she
had
been
drinking
penny
ale
with
a
relish
and
that
as
sour
as
verjuice
and
indeed
she
did
carry
it
mighty
high
and
artificial
wherever
respect
and
humility
were
to
be
commanded
but
it
was
pretty
to
see
how
she
would
unbend
and
become
her
natural
self
where
her
heart
was
touched
by
some
tender
sentiment
how
she
would
empty
her
pockets
to
give
to
any
one
with
a
piteous
tale
how
she
would
get
from
her
horse
to
pluck
by
the
roadside
and
how
one
day
overtaking
a
poor
woman
carrying
a
child
painfully
on
her
back
she
must
have
the
little
one
up
on
her
lap
and
carry
it
till
we
reached
the
hamlet
where
the
woman
lived
etc
on
the
fifteenth
day
we
stayed
at
denys
and
going
thence
the
next
morning
had
travelled
but
a
couple
of
hours
when
we
were
caught
in
a
violent
storm
of
hailstones
as
big
as
peas
that
was
swept
with
incredible
force
by
a
wind
rushing
through
a
deep
ravine
in
the
mountains
so
that
was
as
much
as
we
could
make
headway
through
it
and
gain
a
village
which
lay
but
a
little
distance
from
us
and
here
we
were
forced
to
stay
all
day
by
another
storm
of
rain
that
followed
the
hail
and
continued
till
nightfall
many
others
besides
ourselves
were
compelled
to
seek
refuge
at
our
inn
and
amongst
them
a
company
of
spanish
muleteers
for
it
seems
we
were
come
to
a
pass
leading
through
the
mountains
into
spain
these
were
the
first
spaniards
we
had
yet
seen
save
the
don
and
for
all
we
had
heard
to
their
credit
we
could
not
admire
them
greatly
being
a
ragged
crew
and
more
picturesque
than
cleanly
besides
stinking
intolerably
of
garlic
by
nightfall
there
was
more
company
than
the
inn
could
accommodate
nevertheless
in
respect
to
our
quality
we
were
given
the
best
rooms
in
the
house
to
ourselves
about
eight
as
we
were
about
to
sit
down
to
supper
our
innkeeper
wife
comes
in
to
tell
us
that
a
spanish
grandee
is
below
who
has
been
travelling
for
hours
in
the
storm
and
then
she
asked
very
humbly
if
our
excellencies
will
permit
her
to
lay
him
a
bed
in
our
room
when
we
have
done
with
it
as
she
can
bestow
him
nowhere
else
the
muleteers
filling
her
house
to
the
very
cock
loft
and
has
not
the
heart
to
send
him
on
to
denys
in
this
pitiless
driving
rain
to
this
don
sanchez
replies
that
a
spanish
gentleman
is
welcome
to
all
we
can
offer
him
and
therewith
sends
down
a
mighty
civil
message
begging
his
company
at
our
table
moll
has
just
time
to
whip
on
a
piece
of
finery
and
we
to
put
on
our
best
manners
when
the
landlady
returns
followed
by
a
stout
robust
spaniard
in
an
old
coat
several
times
too
small
for
him
whom
she
introduced
as
señor
don
lopez
de
calvados
don
lopez
makes
us
a
reverence
and
then
with
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ears
and
like
gestures
gives
us
an
harangue
at
some
length
but
this
being
in
spanish
is
as
heathen
greek
to
our
ears
however
don
sanchez
explains
that
our
visitor
is
excusing
his
appearance
as
being
forced
to
change
his
wet
clothes
for
what
the
innkeeper
can
lend
him
and
so
we
grinning
to
express
our
amiability
all
sit
down
to
table
and
set
to
moll
with
her
most
finicking
delicate
airs
and
graces
and
dawson
and
i
silent
as
frogs
with
understanding
nothing
of
the
conversation
this
we
learn
from
don
sanchez
after
supper
has
turned
chiefly
on
the
best
means
of
crossing
into
spain
from
which
it
appears
there
are
two
passes
through
the
mountains
both
leading
to
the
same
town
but
one
more
circuitous
than
the
other
don
lopez
has
come
by
the
latter
because
the
former
is
used
by
the
muleteers
who
are
not
always
the
most
pleasant
companions
one
can
have
in
a
dangerous
road
and
for
this
reason
he
recommends
us
to
take
his
way
especially
as
we
have
a
young
lady
with
us
which
will
be
the
more
practicable
as
the
same
guides
who
conducted
him
will
be
only
too
glad
to
serve
us
on
their
return
the
next
morning
to
this
proposition
we
very
readily
agree
and
supper
being
ended
don
sanchez
sends
for
the
guides
two
hardy
mountaineers
who
very
readily
agree
to
take
us
this
way
the
next
morning
if
the
weather
permits
and
so
we
all
wishing
don
lopez
a
to
our
several
chambers
i
was
awoke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
as
it
seemed
to
me
by
a
great
commotion
below
of
spanish
shouting
and
roaring
with
much
jingling
of
bells
and
looking
out
of
window
i
perceived
lanterns
hanging
here
and
there
in
the
courtyard
and
the
muleteers
packing
their
goods
to
depart
with
a
fine
clear
sky
full
of
stars
overhead
and
scarce
had
i
turned
into
my
warm
bed
again
thanking
god
i
was
no
muleteer
when
in
comes
the
don
with
a
candle
to
say
the
guide
will
have
us
moving
at
once
if
we
would
reach
ravellos
our
spanish
town
before
night
so
i
to
dawson
chamber
and
he
to
moll
and
in
a
little
while
we
all
shivering
down
to
the
great
kitchen
where
is
never
a
muleteer
left
but
only
a
great
stench
of
garlic
to
eat
a
mess
of
soup
very
hot
and
comforting
and
after
that
out
into
the
dark
there
being
as
yet
but
a
faint
flush
of
green
and
primrose
colour
over
towards
the
east
where
four
fresh
mules
which
don
sanchez
overnight
had
bargained
to
exchange
against
our
horses
as
being
the
only
kind
of
cattle
fit
for
this
service
are
waiting
for
us
with
other
two
mules
belonging
to
our
guides
all
very
curiously
trapped
out
with
a
network
of
wool
and
little
jingling
bells
then
when
don
sanchez
had
solemnly
debated
whether
we
should
not
awake
don
lopez
to
say
farewell
and
we
had
persuaded
him
that
it
would
be
kinder
to
let
him
sleep
on
we
mounted
into
our
high
fantastic
saddles
and
set
out
towards
the
mountains
our
guides
leading
and
we
following
close
upon
their
heels
as
our
mules
could
get
but
by
no
guidance
of
ours
though
we
held
the
reins
for
these
creatures
are
very
sagacious
and
so
pertinacious
and
opiniastre
that
i
believe
though
you
pulled
their
heads
off
they
would
yet
go
their
own
way
our
road
at
first
lay
across
a
rising
plain
very
wild
and
scrubby
as
i
imagine
by
the
frequent
deviations
of
our
beast
and
then
through
a
forest
of
cork
oaks
which
keep
their
leaves
all
the
year
through
and
here
by
reason
of
the
great
shade
we
went
not
knowing
whither
as
if
blindfold
only
we
were
conscious
of
being
on
rough
rising
ground
by
the
jolting
of
our
mules
and
the
clatter
of
their
hoofs
upon
stones
but
after
a
wearisome
long
spell
of
this
business
the
trees
growing
more
scattered
and
a
thin
grey
light
creeping
through
we
could
make
out
that
we
were
all
together
which
was
some
comfort
from
these
oaks
we
passed
into
a
wood
of
chestnuts
and
still
going
up
and
up
but
by
such
devious
unseen
ways
that
i
think
no
man
stranger
to
these
parts
could
pick
it
out
for
himself
in
broad
daylight
we
came
thence
into
a
great
stretch
of
pine
trees
with
great
rocks
scattered
amongst
them
as
if
some
mountain
had
been
blown
up
and
fallen
in
a
huge
shower
of
fragments
and
so
still
for
ever
toiling
and
scambling
upwards
we
found
ourselves
about
seven
as
i
should
judge
by
the
light
beyond
the
trees
and
upon
the
side
of
the
mountain
with
the
whole
champaign
laid
out
like
a
carpet
under
us
on
one
side
prodigious
slopes
of
rock
on
either
hand
with
only
a
shrub
or
a
twisted
fir
here
and
there
and
on
the
further
side
a
horrid
stark
ravine
with
a
cascade
of
water
thundering
down
in
its
midst
and
a
peak
rising
beyond
covered
with
snow
which
glittered
in
the
sunlight
like
a
monstrous
heap
of
white
salt
after
resting
at
this
point
half
an
hour
to
breathe
our
mules
the
guides
got
into
their
saddles
and
we
did
likewise
and
so
on
again
along
the
side
of
the
ravine
only
not
of
a
cluster
as
heretofore
but
one
behind
the
other
in
a
long
line
the
mules
falling
into
this
order
of
themselves
as
if
they
had
travelled
the
path
an
hundred
times
but
there
was
no
means
of
going
otherwise
the
path
being
atrociously
narrow
and
steep
and
only
fit
for
wild
goats
there
being
no
landrail
coping
or
anything
in
the
world
to
stay
one
from
being
hurled
down
a
thousand
feet
and
the
mountain
sides
so
inclined
that
was
a
miracle
the
mules
could
find
foothold
and
keep
their
balance
from
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
came
a
constant
roar
of
falling
water
though
we
could
spy
it
only
now
and
then
leaping
down
from
one
chasm
to
another
and
more
than
once
our
guides
would
cry
to
us
to
stop
and
that
where
our
mules
had
to
keep
shifting
their
feet
to
get
a
hold
while
some
huge
boulder
loosened
by
the
night
rain
flew
down
across
our
path
in
terrific
bounds
from
the
heights
above
making
the
very
mountain
tremble
with
the
shock
not
a
word
spoke
we
nay
we
had
scarce
courage
at
times
to
draw
breath
for
two
hours
and
more
of
this
fearful
passage
with
no
encouragement
from
our
guides
save
that
one
of
them
did
coolly
take
out
a
knife
and
peel
an
onion
as
though
he
had
been
on
a
level
broad
road
and
then
reaching
a
flat
space
we
came
to
a
stand
again
before
an
ascent
that
promised
to
be
worse
than
that
we
had
done
here
we
got
down
moll
clinging
to
our
hands
and
looking
around
her
with
large
frighted
eyes
shall
we
soon
be
there
she
asked
and
the
don
putting
this
question
in
spanish
to
the
guides
they
pointed
upwards
to
a
gap
filled
with
snow
and
answered
that
was
the
highest
point
this
was
some
consolation
though
we
could
not
regard
the
rugged
way
that
lay
betwixt
us
and
that
without
quaking
indeed
i
thought
that
even
don
sanchez
despite
the
calm
unmoved
countenance
he
ever
kept
did
look
about
him
with
a
certain
kind
of
uneasiness
however
taking
example
from
our
guides
we
unloosed
our
saddle
bags
and
laid
out
our
store
of
victuals
with
a
hogskin
of
wine
which
rekindled
our
spirits
prodigiously
while
we
were
at
this
repast
our
guides
starting
as
if
they
had
caught
a
sound
though
we
heard
none
save
the
horrid
bursting
of
water
looked
down
and
one
of
them
clapping
two
dirty
fingers
in
his
mouth
made
a
shrill
whistle
then
we
looking
down
presently
spied
two
mules
far
below
on
the
path
we
had
come
but
at
such
a
distance
that
we
could
scarce
make
out
whether
they
were
mounted
or
not
who
are
they
asks
don
sanchez
sternly
as
i
managed
to
understand
friends
replies
one
of
the
fellows
with
a
grin
that
seemed
to
lay
his
face
in
two
halves
chapter
viii
we
were
entertained
in
the
mountains
and
stand
in
a
fair
way
to
have
our
throats
we
will
go
on
when
you
are
ready
says
don
sanchez
turning
to
us
aye
growled
jack
in
my
ear
with
all
my
heart
for
if
these
friends
be
of
the
same
kidney
as
don
lopez
we
may
be
persuaded
to
take
a
better
road
which
god
forbid
if
this
be
a
sample
of
their
preference
so
being
in
our
saddles
forth
we
set
once
more
and
on
a
path
no
easier
than
before
but
worse
like
a
very
housetop
for
steepness
without
a
tinge
of
any
living
thing
for
succour
if
one
fell
but
only
sharp
jagged
rocks
and
that
which
now
added
to
our
peril
was
here
and
there
a
patch
of
snow
so
that
the
mules
must
cock
their
ears
and
feel
their
way
before
advancing
a
step
now
halting
for
dread
and
now
scuttling
on
with
their
tails
betwixt
their
legs
as
the
stones
rolled
under
them
but
the
longest
road
hath
an
end
and
so
at
length
reaching
that
gap
we
had
seen
from
below
to
our
great
content
we
beheld
through
an
angle
in
the
mountain
a
tract
of
open
country
below
looking
mighty
green
and
sweet
in
the
distance
and
at
the
sight
of
this
moll
clapt
her
hands
and
cried
out
with
joy
indeed
we
were
all
as
mad
as
children
with
the
thought
that
our
task
was
half
done
only
the
don
kept
his
gravity
but
turning
to
moll
he
stretches
out
his
hand
towards
the
plain
and
says
with
prodigious
pride
my
country
and
now
we
began
the
descent
which
was
actually
more
perilous
than
the
ascent
but
we
made
light
of
it
being
very
much
enlivened
by
the
high
mountain
air
and
the
relief
from
dread
uncertainty
shouting
out
our
reflections
one
to
another
as
we
jolted
down
the
rugged
path
after
all
jack
says
i
to
him
at
the
top
of
my
voice
being
in
advance
and
next
to
don
sanchez
after
all
don
lopez
was
not
such
a
bad
friend
to
us
upon
which
the
don
stopping
his
mule
at
the
risk
of
being
cast
down
the
abyss
turns
in
his
saddle
and
says
fellow
don
lopez
is
a
spaniard
a
castilian
of
noble
birth
but
here
his
mule
deciding
that
this
was
no
fit
place
for
halting
bundled
onward
at
a
trot
to
overtake
the
guides
and
obliged
his
rider
to
turn
his
attention
to
other
matters
by
the
look
of
the
sun
it
must
have
been
about
two
in
the
afternoon
when
rounding
a
great
bluff
of
rock
we
came
upon
a
kind
of
tableland
which
commanded
a
wide
view
of
the
plain
below
most
dazzling
to
our
eyes
after
the
gloomy
recesses
of
the
pass
and
here
we
found
trees
growing
and
some
rude
attempt
at
cultivation
but
all
very
poor
and
stunted
being
still
very
high
and
exposed
to
the
bleak
winds
issuing
from
the
gorges
our
guides
throwing
themselves
on
the
ground
repaired
once
more
to
their
store
of
onions
and
we
nothing
loath
to
follow
their
examples
opened
our
saddle
bags
and
with
our
cold
meat
and
the
hogskin
of
wine
made
another
good
repast
and
very
merry
and
the
don
falling
into
discourse
with
the
guides
pointed
out
to
us
a
little
white
patch
on
the
plain
below
and
told
us
that
was
ravellos
where
we
should
find
one
of
the
best
posadas
in
the
world
which
added
to
our
satisfaction
but
says
he
is
yet
four
hours
march
ere
we
reach
it
so
we
had
best
be
packing
quickly
thereupon
we
finished
our
meal
in
haste
the
guides
still
lying
on
the
ground
eating
onions
and
when
we
were
prepared
to
start
they
still
lay
there
and
would
not
budge
on
this
ensued
another
discussion
very
indignant
and
passionate
on
the
part
of
don
sanchez
and
as
cool
and
phlegmatic
on
the
side
of
the
guides
the
upshot
of
which
was
as
we
learned
from
don
that
these
rascals
maintained
they
had
fulfilled
their
bargain
in
bringing
us
over
into
spain
but
as
to
carrying
us
to
ravellos
they
would
by
no
means
do
that
without
the
permission
of
their
zefe
who
was
one
of
those
they
had
whistled
to
from
our
last
halting
place
and
whom
they
were
now
staying
for
then
beginning
to
quake
a
bit
at
the
strangeness
of
this
treatment
we
looked
about
us
to
see
if
we
might
venture
to
continue
our
journey
alone
but
lord
one
might
as
easily
have
found
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
as
a
path
amidst
this
labyrinth
of
rocks
and
horrid
fissures
that
environed
us
and
this
was
so
obvious
that
the
guides
though
not
yet
paid
for
their
service
made
no
attempt
to
follow
or
to
stay
us
as
knowing
full
well
we
must
come
back
in
despair
so
there
was
no
choice
but
to
wait
the
coming
up
of
the
zefe
the
don
standing
with
his
legs
astride
and
his
arms
folded
with
a
very
storm
of
passion
in
his
face
in
readiness
to
confront
the
tardy
zefe
with
his
reproaches
for
this
delay
and
the
affront
offered
to
himself
we
casting
our
eye
longingly
down
at
ravellos
and
the
guides
silently
munching
their
onions
thus
we
waited
until
the
fine
ear
of
our
guides
catching
a
sound
they
rose
to
their
feet
muttering
the
word
zefe
and
pull
off
their
hats
as
two
men
mounted
on
mules
tricked
out
like
our
own
came
round
the
corner
and
pulled
up
before
us
but
what
was
our
surprise
to
see
that
the
foremost
of
these
fellows
was
none
other
than
the
don
lopez
de
calvados
we
had
entertained
to
supper
the
night
before
and
of
whose
noble
family
don
sanchez
had
been
prating
so
highly
and
not
a
thread
better
dressed
than
when
we
saw
him
last
and
full
as
dirty
that
which
gave
us
most
uneasiness
however
was
to
observe
that
each
of
these
friends
carried
an
ugly
kind
of
musket
slung
across
his
back
and
a
most
unpleasant
long
sheath
knife
in
his
waist
cloth
not
a
word
says
our
don
sanchez
but
feigning
still
to
believe
him
a
man
of
quality
he
returns
the
other
don
salutation
with
all
the
ceremony
possible
then
don
lopez
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
begs
us
as
i
learnt
afterwards
to
pardon
him
for
keeping
us
waiting
which
had
not
happened
he
assures
us
if
we
had
not
suffered
him
to
oversleep
himself
he
then
informs
us
that
we
are
now
upon
his
domain
and
begs
us
to
accept
such
hospitality
as
his
castillo
will
furnish
in
return
for
our
entertainment
of
last
night
to
this
don
sanchez
replies
with
a
thousand
thanks
that
we
are
anxious
to
reach
ravellos
before
nightfall
and
that
therefore
we
will
be
going
at
once
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
him
with
more
bowing
and
scraping
don
lopez
amiably
but
firmly
declines
to
accept
any
refusal
of
his
offer
or
to
talk
of
business
before
his
debt
of
gratitude
is
paid
with
that
he
gives
a
sign
to
our
guides
who
at
once
lead
off
our
mules
at
a
brisk
trot
leaving
us
to
follow
on
foot
with
don
lopez
and
his
companion
whom
he
introduces
as
don
ruiz
del
puerto
as
arrant
a
rascal
to
look
at
as
ever
i
clapt
eyes
on
so
we
with
very
dismal
forebodings
trudge
on
having
no
other
course
to
take
don
sanchez
to
make
the
best
of
it
warranting
that
no
harm
shall
come
to
us
while
we
are
under
the
hospitable
protection
of
a
spaniard
but
to
no
great
effect
our
faith
being
already
shaken
in
his
valuation
of
spaniards
quitting
the
tableland
ten
minutes
of
leaping
and
scrambling
brought
us
to
a
collection
of
miserable
huts
built
all
along
the
edge
of
a
torrent
overtopped
by
a
square
building
of
more
consequence
built
of
grey
stone
and
roofed
with
slate
shingles
but
with
nothing
but
holes
for
windows
and
this
don
lopez
with
some
pride
told
us
was
his
castillo
a
ragged
crew
of
women
and
children
apprised
of
our
coming
by
the
guide
maybe
trooped
out
of
the
village
to
meet
us
and
hailed
our
approach
with
shouts
of
joy
for
all
the
world
like
a
pack
of
hounds
at
the
sight
of
their
keeper
with
a
dish
of
bones
whispers
jack
dawson
in
my
ear
ominously
but
it
was
curious
to
see
how
they
did
all
fall
back
in
two
lines
those
that
had
hats
taking
them
off
as
don
lopez
passed
he
bowing
to
them
right
and
left
like
any
prince
in
his
progress
so
we
up
to
the
castillo
where
all
the
men
of
the
village
are
assembled
and
all
armed
like
don
lopez
and
they
greet
us
with
cries
of
hola
and
throwing
up
of
hats
they
making
way
for
us
with
salutations
on
both
sides
we
enter
the
castillo
where
we
find
one
great
room
with
a
on
one
side
leading
to
the
floor
above
but
no
furniture
save
a
table
and
some
benches
of
wood
all
black
and
shining
with
grease
and
dirt
but
indeed
the
walls
the
ceiling
and
all
else
about
us
was
beyond
everything
for
blackness
and
this
was
easily
to
be
understood
for
a
wench
coming
in
with
a
cauldron
lights
a
faggot
of
wood
in
a
corner
where
was
no
chimney
to
carry
off
the
smoke
but
only
a
hole
in
the
wall
with
a
kind
of
eaves
over
it
so
that
presently
the
place
was
so
filled
with
the
fumes
was
difficult
to
see
across
it
don
lopez
always
as
gracious
as
a
cat
with
a
milkmaid
asks
moll
through
don
sanchez
if
she
would
like
to
make
her
toilette
while
dinner
is
preparing
and
at
this
offer
all
of
us
jump
choosing
anything
for
a
change
so
he
takes
us
up
the
to
the
floor
above
which
differs
from
that
below
in
being
cut
up
into
half
a
dozen
pieces
by
some
low
partition
of
planks
nailed
loosely
together
like
cribs
for
cattle
with
some
litter
of
dry
leaves
and
hay
in
each
but
in
other
respects
being
just
as
naked
and
grimy
with
a
cloud
of
smoke
coming
up
through
the
chinks
in
the
floor
you
will
have
the
sole
use
of
these
chambers
during
your
stay
says
don
lopez
and
for
your
better
assurance
you
can
draw
the
ladder
up
after
you
on
retiring
for
the
night
but
for
the
gravity
of
our
situation
and
prospects
i
could
have
burst
out
laughing
when
don
sanchez
gave
us
the
translation
of
this
promise
for
the
idea
of
regarding
these
pens
as
chambers
was
not
less
ludicrous
than
the
air
of
pride
with
which
don
lopez
bestowed
the
privilege
of
using
upon
us
don
lopez
left
us
promising
to
send
a
maid
with
the
necessary
appointments
for
moll
toilette
a
plague
of
all
this
finery
growled
dawson
how
long
may
it
be
think
you
señor
ere
we
can
quit
this
palace
and
get
to
one
of
those
posadas
you
promised
us
don
sanchez
hunched
his
shoulders
for
all
reply
and
turned
away
to
hide
his
mortification
and
now
a
girl
comes
up
with
a
biggin
of
water
on
her
head
a
broken
comb
in
her
hand
and
a
ragged
cloth
on
her
arm
that
looked
as
if
it
had
never
been
washed
since
it
left
the
loom
and
sets
them
down
on
a
bench
with
a
grin
at
moll
but
she
though
not
turns
away
with
a
pout
of
disgust
and
then
we
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
to
a
hole
in
the
wall
on
the
windward
side
where
we
stand
all
dumb
with
disappointment
and
dread
until
we
are
called
down
to
dinner
but
before
going
down
don
sanchez
warns
us
to
stand
on
our
best
behaviour
as
these
spaniards
for
all
their
rude
seeming
were
of
a
particularly
punctilious
ticklish
disposition
and
that
we
might
come
badly
out
of
this
business
if
we
happened
to
displease
them
i
can
not
see
reason
in
that
señor
says
dawson
for
the
less
we
please
the
sooner
they
are
likely
to
send
us
hence
and
so
the
better
for
us
as
you
please
replies
the
don
but
my
warning
is
to
your
advantage
down
we
go
and
there
stands
don
lopez
with
a
dozen
choice
friends
all
the
raggedest
dirty
villains
in
the
world
and
they
saluting
us
we
return
their
civility
with
a
very
fair
pretence
and
take
the
seats
offered
us
they
standing
until
we
are
set
then
they
sit
down
and
each
man
lugs
out
a
knife
from
his
the
cauldron
filled
with
a
mess
of
kid
stewed
in
a
multitude
of
onions
is
fetched
from
the
fire
and
being
set
upon
a
smooth
board
is
slid
down
the
table
to
our
host
who
after
picking
out
some
titbits
for
us
serves
himself
and
so
slides
it
back
each
man
in
turn
picking
out
a
morsel
on
the
end
of
his
knife
bearing
in
mind
don
sanchez
warning
we
do
our
best
to
eat
of
this
dish
but
heaven
knows
with
little
relish
and
mighty
glad
when
the
cauldron
is
empty
and
that
part
of
the
performance
ended
then
the
bones
being
swept
from
the
table
a
huge
skin
of
wine
is
set
before
don
lopez
and
he
serves
us
each
with
about
a
quart
in
an
vessel
with
a
spout
which
don
sanchez
and
his
countrymen
use
by
holding
it
above
their
heads
and
letting
the
wine
spurt
into
their
mouths
but
we
being
unused
to
this
fashion
preferred
rather
to
suck
it
out
of
the
spout
which
seemed
to
them
as
odd
a
mode
as
theirs
was
to
us
however
better
wine
drink
it
how
you
may
there
is
none
than
the
wine
of
these
parts
and
this
reconciling
us
considerably
to
our
condition
we
listened
with
content
to
their
singing
of
ditties
which
they
did
very
well
for
such
rude
fellows
to
the
music
of
a
guitar
and
a
tambourine
and
so
when
our
pots
came
to
be
replenished
a
second
time
we
were
all
mighty
merry
and
agreeable
save
jack
dawson
who
never
could
take
his
liquor
like
any
other
man
but
must
fall
into
some
extravagant
humour
and
he
i
perceived
regarded
some
of
the
company
with
a
very
sour
jealous
eye
because
being
warmed
with
drink
they
fell
to
casting
glances
at
moll
with
a
certain
degree
of
familiarity
especially
there
was
one
fellow
with
a
hook
nose
who
stirred
his
bile
exceedingly
sitting
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
jaws
in
his
hands
and
would
scarcely
shift
his
eyes
from
moll
and
since
he
could
not
make
his
displeasure
understood
in
words
and
so
give
vent
to
it
and
be
done
jack
sat
there
in
sullen
silence
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
show
his
resentment
in
some
other
fashion
the
other
saw
this
well
enough
but
would
not
desist
and
so
these
two
sat
fronting
each
other
like
two
dogs
ready
to
fly
at
each
other
throats
at
length
the
rascal
growing
bolder
with
his
liquor
rises
as
if
to
reach
for
his
wine
pot
and
stretching
across
the
table
chucks
moll
under
the
chin
with
his
grimy
fingers
at
this
jack
flinging
out
his
great
fist
with
all
the
force
of
contained
passion
catches
the
other
right
in
the
middle
of
the
face
with
such
effect
that
the
fellow
flies
clean
back
over
his
bench
his
head
striking
the
pavement
with
a
crash
then
in
an
instant
all
his
fellows
spring
to
their
feet
and
a
dozen
long
knives
flash
out
from
their
sheaths
chapter
ix
the
manner
in
which
we
escaped
pretty
fairly
out
of
the
hands
of
señor
don
lopez
and
his
up
starts
jack
dawson
catching
moll
by
the
arm
and
his
joint
stool
by
the
leg
and
stepping
back
a
pace
or
two
not
to
be
taken
in
the
flank
he
swings
his
stool
ready
to
dash
the
brains
out
of
the
first
that
nears
him
and
i
do
likewise
making
the
same
show
of
valour
with
my
stool
but
cutting
a
poor
figure
beside
dawson
mighty
presence
seeing
their
fellow
laid
out
for
dead
on
the
floor
with
his
hook
nose
smashed
most
horridly
into
his
face
the
others
had
no
stomach
to
meet
the
same
fate
but
with
their
spanish
cunning
began
to
spread
out
that
so
they
might
attack
us
on
all
sides
and
surely
this
had
done
our
business
but
that
don
lopez
flinging
himself
before
us
with
his
knife
raised
high
cries
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
rekbah
a
word
of
their
own
language
i
am
told
taken
from
the
moorish
and
signifying
that
whosoever
shall
outrage
the
laws
of
hospitality
under
his
roof
shall
be
his
enemy
to
the
death
and
at
this
word
every
man
stood
still
as
if
by
inchantment
and
let
fall
his
weapon
then
in
the
same
high
voice
he
gives
them
an
harangue
showing
them
that
dawson
was
in
the
right
to
avenge
an
insult
offered
his
daughter
and
the
other
justly
served
for
his
offence
to
us
for
his
offence
to
me
as
the
host
of
these
strangers
adds
he
jose
shall
answer
to
me
hereafter
if
he
live
if
he
be
dead
his
body
shall
be
flung
to
the
vultures
of
the
gorge
and
his
name
be
never
uttered
again
beneath
this
roof
i
bear
no
grudges
not
i
says
dawson
when
don
sanchez
gave
him
the
english
of
this
if
he
live
let
his
nose
be
set
and
if
dead
let
him
be
buried
decently
in
a
churchyard
but
hark
ye
señor
lest
we
fall
out
again
and
come
out
worse
the
next
bout
do
pray
ask
his
worship
if
we
may
not
be
accommodated
with
a
guide
to
take
us
on
our
way
at
once
we
have
yet
two
hours
of
daylight
before
us
there
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
with
such
a
moon
as
we
had
the
night
before
last
we
may
get
on
well
enough
poor
moll
who
was
all
of
a
shake
with
the
terror
of
another
catastrophe
added
her
prayers
to
dawson
and
don
sanchez
with
a
profusion
of
civilities
laid
the
proposal
before
don
lopez
who
though
professing
the
utmost
regret
to
lose
us
so
soon
consented
to
gratify
our
wish
adding
that
his
mules
were
so
well
accustomed
to
the
road
that
they
could
make
the
journey
as
well
in
the
dark
as
in
broad
day
well
then
says
dawson
when
this
was
told
us
let
us
settle
the
business
at
once
and
be
off
and
now
when
don
sanchez
proposed
to
pay
for
the
service
of
our
guides
it
was
curious
to
see
how
every
rascal
at
the
table
craned
forward
to
watch
the
upshot
don
lopez
makes
a
pretence
of
leaving
the
payment
to
don
sanchez
generosity
and
he
not
behindhand
in
courtesy
lugs
out
his
purse
and
begs
the
other
to
pay
himself
whereupon
with
more
apologies
don
lopez
empties
the
money
on
the
table
and
carefully
counts
it
and
there
being
but
about
a
score
of
gold
pieces
and
some
silver
he
shakes
his
head
and
says
a
few
words
to
don
sanchez
in
a
very
reproachful
tone
of
remonstrance
to
which
our
don
replies
by
turning
all
the
trifles
out
of
his
pocket
one
after
the
other
to
prove
that
he
has
no
money
i
thought
as
much
growls
jack
in
my
ear
a
pretty
nest
of
hornets
we
fallen
into
the
company
seeing
there
was
no
more
to
be
got
out
of
don
sanchez
began
to
murmur
and
cast
their
eyes
at
us
whereupon
dawson
seeing
how
the
land
lay
stands
up
and
empties
his
pockets
on
the
table
and
i
likewise
but
betwixt
us
there
was
no
more
than
some
french
pennies
and
a
few
odds
and
ends
of
no
value
at
all
fetching
a
deep
sigh
don
lopez
takes
all
these
possessions
into
a
heap
before
him
and
tells
don
sanchez
that
he
can
not
believe
persons
of
our
quality
could
travel
with
so
little
that
he
feels
convinced
don
sanchez
must
have
dropped
a
purse
on
the
way
and
that
until
it
is
found
he
can
on
no
account
allow
us
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
this
comes
of
being
so
mighty
fine
says
dawson
when
don
sanchez
had
explained
matters
had
we
travelled
as
became
our
condition
this
brigand
would
never
have
ensnared
us
hither
and
if
they
wo
believe
your
story
señor
i
ca
blame
for
i
would
have
sworn
you
had
a
thousand
pounds
to
your
hand
do
you
reproach
me
for
my
generosity
asks
the
don
nay
master
i
love
you
for
being
free
with
your
money
while
you
have
it
but
is
a
queer
kind
of
generosity
to
bring
us
into
these
parts
with
no
means
of
taking
us
back
again
we
say
no
more
about
that
if
we
get
out
of
this
cursed
and
as
we
are
like
to
come
off
ill
if
these
keep
us
here
a
week
or
so
and
get
nothing
by
it
be
best
to
tell
the
honest
truth
and
acquaint
them
that
we
are
no
gentle
folk
but
only
three
poor
english
mountebanks
brought
hither
on
a
wild
goose
chase
this
was
a
bitter
pill
for
don
sanchez
to
swallow
however
seeing
no
other
cure
for
our
ills
he
gulped
it
down
with
the
best
face
he
could
put
on
it
but
from
the
mockery
and
laughter
of
all
who
heard
him
was
plain
to
see
they
would
not
believe
a
word
of
his
story
what
would
you
have
me
do
now
asks
the
don
turning
to
us
when
the
clamour
had
subsided
and
he
told
us
how
he
had
tried
to
persuade
them
we
were
dancers
he
was
taking
for
a
show
to
the
fair
at
barcelona
which
they
by
our
looks
would
not
believe
and
especially
that
a
man
of
such
build
as
jack
dawson
could
foot
it
even
to
please
such
heavy
people
as
the
english
what
cries
jack
i
ca
dance
we
will
pretty
soon
put
them
to
another
complexion
if
they
do
but
give
us
space
and
a
fair
trial
you
can
strum
a
guitar
kit
for
i
heard
you
and
moll
my
chick
do
you
dash
the
tears
from
your
cheek
and
pluck
up
courage
to
show
these
portugals
what
an
english
lass
can
do
the
brigands
agreeing
to
this
trial
the
table
is
shoved
back
to
give
us
a
space
in
the
best
light
and
our
judges
seat
themselves
conveniently
moll
brushes
her
eyes
to
a
little
murmur
of
sympathy
as
i
thought
and
i
striking
out
the
tune
jack
with
all
the
magnificence
of
a
king
takes
her
hand
and
leads
her
out
to
a
french
pavan
and
sure
no
one
in
the
world
ever
stepped
it
more
gracefully
than
our
poor
little
moll
now
put
upon
her
mettle
nor
more
lightly
than
dawson
so
that
every
rascal
in
our
audience
was
won
to
admiration
clapping
hands
and
shouting
hola
when
it
was
done
and
this
warming
us
we
gave
next
an
italian
coranto
and
after
that
an
english
pillow
dance
and
in
good
faith
had
they
all
been
our
dearest
friends
these
dirty
fellows
could
not
have
gone
more
mad
with
delight
and
then
moll
and
her
father
sitting
down
to
fetch
their
breath
a
dispute
arose
among
the
brigands
which
we
were
at
a
loss
to
understand
until
don
sanchez
explained
that
a
certain
number
would
have
it
we
were
real
dancers
but
that
another
party
with
don
lopez
maintained
these
were
but
court
dances
which
only
proved
the
more
we
were
of
high
quality
to
be
thus
accomplished
we
convince
yet
moll
with
a
pox
of
their
doubts
cries
dawson
starting
to
his
feet
again
tell
we
will
give
a
stage
dance
of
a
nymph
and
a
wild
man
señor
with
an
excuse
for
our
having
no
costume
but
this
play
us
our
pastoral
kit
and
sing
you
your
ditty
of
heart
moll
in
the
right
place
that
i
may
get
my
wind
for
the
last
caper
moll
nods
and
with
ready
wit
takes
the
ribbon
from
her
head
letting
her
pretty
hair
tumble
all
about
her
shoulders
and
then
whipping
up
her
long
skirt
tucks
one
end
under
her
girdle
thereby
making
a
very
dainty
show
of
pink
lining
against
the
dark
stuff
and
also
giving
more
play
for
her
feet
and
so
thus
they
dance
their
pastoral
don
sanchez
taking
a
tambourine
and
tapping
it
lightly
to
the
measure
up
to
moll
song
which
so
ravished
these
hardy
stony
men
by
the
pathetic
sweetness
of
her
voice
for
they
could
understand
nothing
save
by
her
expression
that
they
would
not
let
the
dance
go
on
until
she
had
sung
it
through
again
to
conclude
jack
springs
up
as
one
enamoured
to
madness
and
flings
out
his
last
steps
with
such
vigour
and
agility
as
to
quite
astound
all
illustration
moll
and
her
father
dance
a
pastoral
and
now
the
show
being
ended
and
not
one
but
is
of
hola
and
animo
moll
snatches
the
tambourine
from
don
sanchez
hand
and
stepping
before
don
lopez
drops
him
a
curtsey
and
offers
it
for
her
reward
at
this
don
lopez
glancing
at
the
money
on
the
table
by
his
side
and
looking
round
for
sanction
to
his
company
which
they
did
give
him
without
one
voice
of
opposition
he
takes
up
two
of
the
gold
pieces
and
drops
them
on
the
parchment
thus
did
our
moll
by
one
clever
hit
draw
an
acknowledgment
from
them
that
we
were
indeed
no
fine
folks
but
mere
players
which
point
they
might
have
stumbled
over
in
their
cooler
moments
but
we
were
not
quit
yet
for
on
don
sanchez
begging
that
we
should
now
be
set
upon
our
road
to
ravellos
the
other
replies
that
though
he
will
do
us
this
service
with
great
pleasure
yet
he
can
not
permit
us
to
encounter
the
danger
again
of
being
taken
for
persons
of
quality
fine
dress
says
he
may
be
necessary
to
the
señor
and
his
daughter
for
their
court
dances
and
they
are
heartily
welcome
to
them
for
the
pleasure
they
have
given
us
but
for
you
and
the
musician
who
plays
but
indifferent
well
meaner
garb
is
more
suitable
and
so
you
will
be
good
enough
to
step
upstairs
the
pair
of
you
and
change
your
clothing
for
such
as
we
can
furnish
from
our
store
and
upstairs
we
were
forced
to
go
don
sanchez
and
i
and
there
being
stripped
we
were
given
such
dirty
foul
rags
and
so
grotesque
that
when
we
came
down
jack
dawson
and
moll
fell
at
us
as
though
they
would
burst
and
in
truth
we
made
a
most
ludicrous
spectacle
especially
the
don
whom
hitherto
we
had
seen
only
in
the
neatest
and
most
noble
of
clothes
looking
more
like
a
couple
of
scarecrows
than
living
men
don
sanchez
neither
smiled
nor
frowned
at
this
treatment
taking
this
misfortune
with
the
resignation
of
a
philosopher
only
to
quiet
merriment
he
told
him
that
in
the
clothes
taken
from
him
was
sewed
up
a
bond
for
two
hundred
pounds
but
whether
this
was
true
or
not
i
can
not
tell
and
now
to
bring
an
end
to
this
adventure
we
were
taken
down
the
intricate
passes
of
the
mountain
in
the
moonlight
as
many
of
the
gang
as
could
find
mules
coming
with
us
for
escort
and
brought
at
last
to
the
main
road
where
we
were
left
with
nought
but
what
we
stood
in
save
moll
two
pieces
the
robbers
bidding
us
their
adios
with
all
the
courtesy
imaginable
but
even
then
robbed
of
all
he
had
even
to
the
clothes
of
his
back
don
sanchez
pride
was
unshaken
for
he
bade
us
note
that
the
very
thieves
in
spain
were
gentlemen
as
we
trudged
along
the
road
toward
ravellos
we
fell
debating
on
our
case
as
what
we
should
do
next
don
sanchez
promising
that
we
should
have
redress
for
our
that
his
name
alone
would
procure
us
a
supply
of
money
for
our
requirements
to
my
great
content
but
dawson
was
of
another
mind
as
for
seeking
redress
says
he
i
would
as
soon
kick
at
a
hive
for
being
stung
by
a
bee
and
the
wisest
course
when
you
been
once
bit
by
a
dog
is
to
keep
out
of
his
way
for
the
future
with
respect
of
getting
money
by
your
honour
name
you
may
do
as
you
please
and
so
may
you
kit
if
you
so
minded
but
for
my
part
henceforth
i
pretend
to
be
no
better
than
i
am
and
the
first
suit
of
rags
i
can
get
will
i
wear
in
the
fashion
of
this
country
and
so
shall
you
moll
my
dear
so
make
up
your
mind
to
lay
aside
your
fine
airs
and
hold
up
your
nose
no
longer
as
if
you
were
too
good
for
your
father
why
surely
jack
says
i
you
would
not
quit
us
and
go
from
your
bargain
not
i
and
you
should
know
me
well
enough
kit
to
have
no
doubt
on
that
score
but
is
no
part
of
our
bargain
that
we
should
bustle
anybody
but
simon
the
steward
we
have
four
hundred
miles
to
go
ere
we
reach
elche
says
don
sanchez
can
you
tell
me
how
we
are
to
get
there
without
money
aye
that
i
can
and
i
warrant
my
plan
as
good
as
your
honour
how
many
tens
are
there
in
four
hundred
kit
forty
well
we
can
walk
ten
miles
a
day
on
level
ground
and
so
may
do
this
journey
in
six
weeks
or
thereabouts
which
is
no
such
great
matter
seeing
we
are
not
to
be
back
in
england
afore
next
year
we
can
buy
a
guitar
and
a
tabor
out
of
moll
pieces
with
them
we
can
give
a
show
wherever
we
stay
for
the
night
and
if
honest
men
do
but
pay
us
half
as
much
as
the
thieves
of
this
country
we
may
fare
pretty
well
i
confess
says
don
sanchez
your
scheme
is
the
best
and
i
would
myself
have
proposed
it
but
that
i
can
do
so
little
for
my
share
why
what
odds
does
that
make
señor
cries
jack
you
gave
us
of
the
best
while
you
had
aught
to
give
and
is
but
fair
we
should
do
the
same
now
besides
which
how
could
we
get
along
without
you
for
a
spokesman
and
i
marked
that
you
drummed
to
our
dance
very
tunefully
come
is
it
a
bargain
friend
and
on
don
sanchez
consenting
jack
would
have
us
all
shake
hands
on
it
for
a
sign
of
faith
and
good
fellowship
then
perceiving
that
we
were
arrived
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
we
ended
our
discussion
chapter
x
our
merry
journeying
to
we
turned
into
the
first
posada
we
came
to
a
poor
mean
sort
of
an
inn
and
general
shop
to
be
sure
but
we
were
in
no
condition
to
cavil
about
trifles
being
fagged
out
with
our
journey
and
the
adventures
of
the
day
and
only
too
happy
to
find
a
house
of
entertainment
still
open
so
after
a
dish
of
sausages
with
very
good
wine
we
to
our
beds
and
an
end
to
the
torment
of
fleas
i
had
endured
from
the
moment
i
changed
my
french
habit
for
spanish
rags
the
next
morning
when
we
had
eaten
a
meal
of
goats
milk
and
bread
and
paid
our
reckoning
which
amounted
to
a
few
rials
and
no
more
don
sanchez
and
i
taking
what
rested
of
moll
two
pieces
went
forth
into
the
town
and
there
bought
two
plain
suits
of
clothes
for
ourselves
in
the
mode
of
the
country
and
according
to
his
desire
another
of
the
same
cut
for
dawson
together
with
a
little
jacket
and
petticoat
for
moll
and
these
expenditures
left
us
but
just
enough
to
buy
a
good
guitar
and
a
tambourine
indeed
we
should
not
have
got
them
at
all
but
that
don
sanchez
higgled
and
bargained
like
any
jew
which
he
could
do
with
a
very
good
face
now
that
he
was
dressed
so
beggarly
then
back
to
our
posada
where
in
our
room
jack
and
i
were
mighty
merry
in
putting
on
our
new
clothes
but
going
below
we
find
moll
still
dressed
in
her
finery
and
sulking
before
the
petticoat
and
jacket
we
had
bought
for
her
which
she
would
not
put
on
by
any
persuasion
until
her
father
fell
into
a
passion
of
anger
and
the
sight
of
him
fuming
in
a
short
jacket
barely
covering
his
loins
and
a
pair
of
breeches
so
tight
the
seams
would
scarce
hold
together
so
tickled
her
sense
of
humour
that
she
fell
into
a
long
fit
of
laughter
and
this
ending
her
sulks
she
went
upstairs
with
a
good
grace
and
returned
in
her
hated
petticoat
carrying
her
fine
dress
in
a
bundle
but
i
never
yet
knew
the
time
when
this
sly
baggage
would
not
please
herself
for
all
her
seeming
yielding
to
others
and
we
were
yet
to
have
more
pain
from
her
than
she
from
us
in
respect
of
that
skirt
for
ere
we
had
got
half
way
through
the
town
she
dawdling
behind
to
look
first
in
this
shop
and
then
in
that
gave
us
the
slip
so
that
we
were
best
part
of
an
hour
hunting
the
streets
up
and
down
in
the
utmost
anxiety
then
as
we
were
sweating
with
our
exercise
and
trouble
lo
she
steps
out
of
a
shop
as
calm
as
you
please
in
a
petticoat
and
jacket
of
her
own
fancy
and
ten
times
more
handsome
than
our
purchase
a
red
shawl
tied
about
her
waist
and
a
little
round
hat
with
a
bright
red
bob
in
it
set
on
one
side
of
her
head
and
all
as
smart
as
a
carrot
da
says
she
where
have
you
been
running
all
this
time
and
we
betwixt
joy
at
finding
her
and
anger
at
her
impudence
could
say
nothing
and
yet
we
were
fain
to
admire
her
audacity
too
but
how
not
knowing
one
word
of
the
language
she
had
made
her
wants
known
was
a
mystery
and
how
she
had
obtained
this
finery
was
another
seeing
that
we
had
spent
all
there
was
of
her
two
pieces
certainly
she
had
not
changed
her
french
gown
and
things
for
them
for
these
in
a
cumbrous
bundle
had
her
father
been
carrying
up
and
down
the
town
since
we
lost
the
minx
if
you
ha
stole
says
dawson
finding
his
tongue
at
last
where
did
you
find
the
money
to
pay
for
those
trappings
slut
in
my
pocket
sir
says
she
with
a
curtsey
where
you
might
have
found
yours
had
you
not
emptied
it
so
readily
for
the
robbers
yesterday
and
i
fancy
adds
she
slyly
i
may
still
find
some
left
to
offer
you
a
dinner
at
midday
if
you
will
accept
of
it
this
hint
disposed
us
to
make
light
of
our
grievance
against
her
and
we
went
out
of
ravellos
very
well
satisfied
to
know
that
our
next
meal
depended
not
solely
upon
chance
and
this
together
with
the
bright
sunlight
and
the
sweet
invigorating
morning
air
did
beget
in
us
a
spirit
of
happy
carelessness
in
keeping
with
the
smiling
gay
aspect
of
the
country
about
us
it
was
strange
to
see
how
easily
moll
fell
into
our
humour
she
who
had
been
as
stately
as
any
roman
queen
in
her
long
gown
being
now
in
her
short
coloured
petticoat
as
frolicsome
and
familiar
as
a
country
wench
at
a
fair
but
indeed
she
was
a
born
actress
and
could
accommodate
herself
as
well
to
one
condition
as
another
with
the
mere
change
of
clothes
but
i
think
this
state
was
more
to
her
real
taste
than
the
other
as
putting
no
restraint
upon
her
impulses
and
giving
free
play
to
her
healthy
exuberant
mirth
her
very
step
was
a
kind
of
dance
and
she
must
needs
fall
of
songs
like
a
lark
when
it
flies
then
she
would
have
us
rehearse
our
old
songs
to
our
new
music
so
slinging
my
guitar
in
front
of
me
i
put
it
in
tune
and
jack
ties
his
bundle
to
his
back
that
he
may
try
his
hand
at
the
tambourine
and
so
we
march
along
singing
and
playing
as
if
to
a
feast
and
stopping
only
to
laugh
prodigiously
when
one
or
other
fell
out
of
tune
the
most
mad
fools
in
the
world
but
i
speak
not
of
don
sanchez
who
feel
what
he
might
never
relaxed
his
high
bearing
or
unbent
his
serious
countenance
one
thing
i
remember
of
him
on
this
journey
having
gone
about
five
miles
we
sat
us
down
on
a
bridge
to
rest
a
while
and
there
the
don
left
us
to
go
a
little
way
up
the
course
of
the
stream
that
flowed
beneath
and
he
came
back
with
a
posey
of
sweet
jonquils
set
off
with
a
delicate
kind
of
fern
very
pretty
and
this
he
presents
to
moll
with
a
gracious
little
speech
which
act
it
seemed
to
me
was
to
let
her
know
that
he
respected
her
still
as
a
young
gentlewoman
in
spite
of
her
short
petticoat
and
moll
was
not
dull
to
the
compliment
neither
for
after
the
first
cry
of
delight
in
seeing
these
natural
dainty
flowers
she
loving
such
things
beyond
all
else
in
the
world
she
bethought
her
to
make
him
a
curtsey
and
reply
to
his
speech
with
another
as
good
and
well
turned
as
she
set
them
in
her
waist
scarf
also
i
remember
on
this
road
we
saw
oranges
and
lemons
growing
for
the
first
time
but
full
a
mile
after
moll
had
first
caught
their
wondrous
perfume
in
the
air
and
these
trees
which
are
about
the
size
of
a
crab
tree
grew
in
close
groves
on
either
side
of
the
road
with
no
manner
of
fence
to
protect
them
so
that
any
one
is
lief
to
pluck
what
he
may
without
let
so
plentiful
are
they
and
curious
to
see
how
fruit
and
blossom
grow
together
on
the
same
bush
the
lemons
as
i
hear
giving
four
crops
in
the
year
and
more
delicious
full
and
juicy
than
any
to
be
bought
in
england
at
six
to
the
groat
we
got
a
dinner
of
bread
and
cheese
very
high
at
a
roadside
house
and
glad
to
have
that
only
no
meat
of
any
kind
but
excellent
good
wine
with
dried
figs
and
walnuts
which
is
the
natural
food
of
this
country
where
one
may
go
a
week
without
touching
flesh
and
yet
feel
as
strong
and
hearty
at
the
end
and
here
very
merry
jack
in
his
pertinacious
stubborn
spirit
declaring
he
would
drink
his
wine
in
the
custom
of
the
country
or
none
at
all
and
so
lifting
up
the
spouted
mug
at
length
he
squirts
the
liquor
all
over
his
face
down
his
new
clothes
and
everywhere
but
into
his
mouth
before
he
could
arrive
to
do
it
like
don
sanchez
but
getting
into
the
trick
of
it
he
so
mighty
proud
of
his
achievement
that
he
must
drink
pot
after
pot
until
he
got
as
drunk
as
any
lord
so
after
that
finding
a
retired
place
it
being
midday
and
prodigious
hot
though
only
now
in
we
lay
down
under
the
orange
trees
and
slept
a
long
hour
to
our
great
refreshment
dawson
on
waking
remembered
nothing
of
his
being
drunk
and
felt
not
one
penny
the
worse
for
it
and
so
on
another
long
stretch
through
sweet
country
with
here
and
there
a
glimpse
of
the
mediterranean
in
the
distance
of
a
surprising
blueness
before
we
reached
another
town
and
that
on
the
top
of
a
high
hill
but
it
seems
that
all
the
towns
in
these
parts
save
those
armed
with
fortresses
are
thus
built
for
security
against
the
pirates
who
ravage
the
seaboard
of
this
continent
incessantly
from
end
to
end
and
for
this
reason
the
roads
leading
up
to
the
town
are
made
very
narrow
tortuous
and
difficult
with
in
places
and
many
points
where
a
few
armed
men
lying
in
ambush
may
overwhelm
an
enemy
ten
times
as
strong
the
towns
themselves
are
fortified
with
gates
the
streets
extremely
narrow
and
crooked
and
the
houses
massed
all
together
with
secret
passages
one
to
another
and
a
network
of
little
alleys
leading
whither
only
the
inhabitants
knew
so
that
if
an
enemy
do
get
into
them
is
ten
to
one
he
will
never
come
out
alive
it
being
market
day
in
this
town
here
jack
and
his
daughter
gave
a
show
of
dancing
first
in
their
french
suits
which
were
vastly
admired
and
after
in
their
spanish
clothes
but
then
they
were
asked
to
dance
a
fandango
which
they
could
not
however
we
fared
very
well
getting
the
value
of
five
shillings
in
little
moneys
and
the
innkeepers
would
take
nothing
for
our
entertainment
because
of
the
custom
we
had
brought
his
house
which
we
considered
very
handsome
on
his
part
we
set
out
again
the
next
morning
but
having
shown
how
we
passed
the
first
day
i
need
not
dwell
upon
those
which
followed
before
we
reached
barcelona
there
being
nothing
of
any
great
importance
to
tell
only
moll
was
now
all
agog
to
learn
the
spanish
dances
and
i
can
not
easily
forget
how
after
much
coaxing
and
wheedling
on
her
part
she
at
length
persuaded
don
sanchez
to
show
her
a
fandango
for
surely
nothing
in
the
world
was
ever
more
comic
than
this
stately
don
without
any
music
and
in
the
middle
of
the
high
road
cutting
capers
with
a
countenance
as
solemn
as
any
person
at
a
burying
no
one
could
be
more
quick
to
observe
the
ludicrous
than
he
nor
more
careful
to
avoid
ridicule
therefore
it
said
much
for
moll
cajolery
or
for
the
love
he
bore
her
even
at
this
time
to
thus
expose
himself
to
dawson
rude
mirth
and
mine
in
order
to
please
her
we
reached
barcelona
the
of
april
and
there
we
stayed
till
the
of
may
for
moll
would
go
no
further
before
she
had
learnt
a
bolero
and
a
fandango
which
dances
we
saw
danced
at
a
little
theatre
excellently
well
but
in
a
style
quite
different
to
ours
and
the
women
very
fat
and
plain
and
though
moll
being
but
a
slight
slip
of
a
lass
in
whom
the
warmer
passions
were
unbegotten
could
not
give
the
bolero
the
voluptuous
fervour
of
the
spanish
dancers
yet
in
agility
and
in
pretty
innocent
grace
she
did
surpass
them
all
to
nought
which
was
abundantly
proved
when
she
danced
it
in
our
posada
before
a
court
full
of
spaniards
for
there
they
were
like
mad
over
her
casting
their
silk
handkerchiefs
at
her
feet
in
homage
and
filling
jack
tambourine
three
times
over
with
cigarros
and
a
plentiful
scattering
of
rials
and
i
believe
had
we
stayed
there
we
might
have
made
more
money
than
ever
we
wanted
at
that
time
though
not
so
much
as
don
sanchez
had
set
his
mind
on
wherefore
he
would
have
us
jogging
again
as
soon
as
moll
could
be
brought
to
it
from
barcelona
we
journeyed
a
month
to
valencia
growing
more
indolent
with
our
easier
circumstances
and
sometimes
trudging
no
more
than
five
or
six
miles
in
a
day
and
we
were
i
think
the
happiest
idlest
set
of
vagabonds
in
existence
but
indeed
in
this
country
there
is
not
that
spur
to
exertion
which
is
for
ever
goading
us
in
this
the
sun
fills
one
heart
with
content
and
for
one
other
wants
a
few
halfpence
a
day
will
suffice
and
if
you
have
them
not
is
no
such
great
matter
for
these
people
are
exceeding
kind
and
hospitable
they
will
give
you
a
measure
of
wine
if
you
are
thirsty
as
we
would
give
a
mug
of
water
and
the
poorest
man
will
not
sit
down
to
table
without
making
you
an
offer
to
share
what
he
has
wherever
we
went
we
were
well
received
and
in
those
poor
villages
where
they
had
no
money
to
give
they
would
pay
us
for
our
show
in
kind
one
giving
us
bed
another
board
and
filling
our
wallets
ere
we
left
with
the
best
they
could
afford
was
our
habit
to
walk
a
few
miles
before
dinner
to
sleep
in
the
shade
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
to
reach
a
town
if
possible
by
the
fall
of
the
sun
there
would
we
spend
half
the
night
in
jollity
and
lie
abed
late
in
the
morning
the
inns
and
big
houses
in
these
parts
are
built
in
the
form
of
squares
enclosing
an
open
court
with
a
sort
of
arcade
all
round
and
mostly
with
a
running
over
the
sunnier
side
and
in
this
space
we
used
to
give
our
performance
by
the
light
of
oil
lamps
hung
here
and
there
conveniently
with
the
addition
maybe
of
moonlight
reflected
from
one
of
the
white
walls
here
any
one
was
free
to
enter
we
making
no
charge
but
taking
only
what
they
would
freely
give
and
this
treatment
engenders
a
feeling
of
kindness
on
both
sides
very
different
to
our
sentiment
at
home
where
we
players
as
often
as
not
dread
the
audience
as
a
kind
of
enemy
ready
to
tear
us
to
pieces
if
we
fail
to
please
and
ours
was
as
great
a
pleasure
to
amuse
as
theirs
to
be
amused
i
can
recall
to
mind
nothing
of
any
moment
occurring
on
this
journey
save
that
we
spent
some
time
every
day
in
perfecting
our
spanish
dances
i
getting
to
play
the
tunes
correctly
which
at
first
i
made
sad
bungling
of
and
dawson
in
learning
of
his
steps
also
he
and
moll
acquired
the
use
of
a
kind
of
clappers
called
costagnettes
which
they
play
with
their
hands
in
these
fandangos
and
boleros
with
a
very
pleasing
effect
at
valencia
we
stayed
a
week
and
three
days
lingering
more
than
was
necessary
in
order
to
see
a
and
this
pastime
they
do
not
as
we
with
dogs
but
with
men
and
the
bull
quite
free
and
save
for
the
needless
killing
of
horses
i
think
this
a
very
noble
exercise
being
a
fair
trial
of
human
address
against
brute
force
and
is
not
nearly
so
beastly
as
seeing
a
prize
fought
by
men
and
not
more
cruel
i
take
it
than
the
shooting
of
birds
and
hares
for
sport
seeing
that
the
agony
of
death
is
no
greater
for
a
sturdy
bull
than
for
a
timid
coney
and
hath
this
advantage
that
the
bull
when
exhausted
is
despatched
quickly
whereas
the
bird
or
hare
may
just
escape
capture
to
die
a
miserable
long
death
with
a
shattered
limb
from
valencia
we
travelled
five
weeks
growing
i
think
more
lazy
every
day
over
very
hilly
country
to
alicante
a
seaport
town
very
strongly
protected
by
a
castle
on
a
great
rock
armed
with
guns
of
brass
and
iron
so
that
the
pirates
dare
never
venture
near
and
here
i
fully
thought
we
were
to
dawdle
away
another
week
at
the
least
this
being
a
very
populous
and
lively
city
promising
much
entertainment
for
moll
when
not
playing
herself
was
mad
to
see
others
play
and
she
did
really
govern
with
her
subtle
wiles
and
winning
smiles
more
than
her
father
for
all
his
masterful
spirit
or
don
sanchez
with
his
stern
authority
but
seeing
two
or
three
english
ships
in
the
port
the
don
deemed
it
advisable
that
we
should
push
on
at
once
for
elche
and
to
our
great
astonishment
moll
consented
to
our
speedy
going
without
demur
though
why
we
could
not
then
discover
but
did
soon
after
as
i
shall
presently
show
chapter
xi
our
first
coming
to
elche
and
the
strangeness
of
that
being
resolved
to
our
purpose
overnight
we
set
out
fairly
early
in
the
morning
for
elche
which
lies
half
a
dozen
leagues
or
thereabouts
to
the
west
of
alicante
our
way
lay
through
gardens
of
oranges
and
spreading
vineyards
which
flourish
exceedingly
in
this
part
being
protected
from
unkind
winds
by
high
mountains
against
the
north
and
east
and
here
you
shall
picture
us
on
the
white
dusty
road
moll
leading
the
way
a
dozen
yards
in
advance
a
tambourine
slung
on
her
back
with
streaming
ribbons
of
many
colours
taking
two
or
three
steps
on
one
foot
and
then
two
or
three
steps
on
with
a
spanish
twist
of
her
hips
at
each
turn
swinging
her
arms
as
she
claps
her
costagnettes
to
the
air
of
a
song
she
had
picked
up
at
barcelona
and
we
three
men
plodding
behind
the
don
with
a
guitar
across
his
back
dawson
with
our
bundle
of
clothes
and
i
with
a
wallet
of
provisions
hanging
o
one
side
and
a
skin
of
wine
on
the
other
and
all
as
white
as
any
millers
with
the
dust
of
dancing
it
might
be
as
well
says
don
sanchez
in
his
solemn
deliberate
manner
if
mistress
moll
were
advised
to
practise
her
steps
in
our
rear
aye
señor
replied
dawson
i
been
of
the
same
mind
these
last
ten
minutes
but
with
your
consent
don
sanchez
i
put
her
to
a
more
serious
exercise
the
don
consenting
with
a
bow
jack
continues
you
may
have
observed
that
i
have
opened
my
lips
since
we
left
the
town
and
the
reason
thereof
is
that
i
been
turning
over
in
my
mind
whether
having
come
thus
far
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
let
my
moll
know
of
our
project
because
if
she
should
refuse
the
sooner
we
consider
some
other
plan
the
better
seeing
that
now
she
is
in
good
case
and
as
careless
as
a
bird
on
the
bough
and
she
is
less
tractable
to
our
purposes
than
when
she
felt
the
pinch
of
hunger
and
cold
and
would
have
jumped
at
anything
for
a
bit
of
comfort
does
she
not
know
of
our
design
asks
the
don
lifting
his
eyebrows
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
señor
answers
jack
for
though
kit
and
i
may
have
discoursed
of
it
at
odd
times
we
have
been
mighty
careful
to
shut
our
mouths
or
talk
of
a
fine
day
at
her
approach
very
good
says
don
sanchez
you
are
her
father
and
she
shall
know
it
says
jack
with
resolution
and
taking
a
stride
or
two
in
advance
he
calls
to
her
to
give
over
dancing
and
come
to
him
have
you
forgot
your
breeding
he
asks
as
she
turns
and
waits
for
him
that
you
have
no
more
respect
for
your
elders
than
to
choke
with
dust
along
of
your
shuffling
what
a
thoughtless
thing
am
i
cries
she
in
a
voice
of
contrition
why
you
floured
as
white
as
a
shade
then
taking
up
a
corner
of
her
she
gently
rubs
away
the
dust
from
the
tip
of
his
nose
so
that
it
stood
out
glowing
red
from
his
face
like
a
cherry
through
a
hole
in
a
at
which
she
claps
her
hands
and
rings
out
a
peal
of
laughter
i
counted
to
make
a
lady
of
you
moll
says
jack
in
sorrow
but
i
see
plainly
you
will
ever
be
a
fool
and
so
is
to
no
purpose
to
speak
seriously
surely
father
i
have
ever
been
what
you
wish
me
to
be
answers
she
demurely
curious
now
to
know
what
he
would
be
telling
her
then
do
you
put
them
plaguy
clappers
away
and
listen
to
me
patiently
says
he
moll
puts
her
hands
behind
her
and
drawing
a
long
lip
and
casting
round
eyes
at
us
over
her
shoulder
walks
along
very
slowly
by
her
side
while
he
broaches
the
matter
to
her
and
this
he
did
with
some
difficulty
for
is
no
easy
thing
to
make
a
roguish
plot
look
innocent
as
we
could
see
by
his
shifting
his
bundle
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
now
and
again
scratching
his
ear
and
the
like
but
what
he
said
we
walking
a
pace
or
two
behind
could
not
catch
he
dropping
to
a
very
low
tone
as
if
ashamed
to
hear
his
own
voice
to
all
he
has
to
tell
she
listens
very
attentively
but
in
the
end
she
says
something
which
causes
him
to
stop
dead
short
and
turn
upon
her
gaping
like
a
pig
what
he
cries
as
we
came
up
you
knew
all
this
two
months
ago
yes
father
answers
she
primly
quite
two
months
and
pray
who
told
you
he
asks
no
one
father
since
you
forbade
me
to
ask
questions
but
though
i
may
be
dumb
to
oblige
you
i
ca
be
deaf
kit
and
you
are
for
ever
of
it
maybe
child
says
dawson
mightily
nettled
maybe
you
know
why
we
left
alicante
this
morning
i
should
be
dull
indeed
if
i
did
answers
she
and
if
you
said
when
we
saw
the
ships
that
we
might
meet
more
englishmen
in
the
town
than
we
might
care
to
know
hereafter
why
well
maybe
we
should
have
been
in
alicante
now
by
denying
yourself
that
satisfaction
says
don
sanchez
we
may
conclude
that
the
future
we
are
making
for
you
is
not
unacceptable
moll
stopped
and
says
with
some
passion
i
would
turn
back
now
and
go
over
those
mountains
the
way
we
came
to
ride
through
france
in
my
fine
gown
like
a
lady
brava
bravamente
says
the
don
in
a
low
voice
as
she
steps
on
in
front
of
us
holding
her
head
high
with
the
recollection
of
her
former
state
she
was
ever
like
that
whispers
dawson
with
pride
we
could
never
get
her
to
play
a
mean
part
willingly
could
we
kit
she
was
for
ever
wanting
the
part
of
a
queen
writ
for
her
the
next
day
about
sundown
coming
to
a
little
eminence
don
sanchez
points
out
a
dark
patch
of
forest
lying
betwixt
us
and
the
mountains
and
says
that
is
elche
the
place
where
we
are
to
stay
some
months
we
could
make
out
no
houses
at
all
but
he
told
us
the
town
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
and
added
some
curious
particulars
as
how
lying
on
flat
ground
and
within
easy
access
of
the
sea
it
could
not
exist
at
all
but
for
the
sufferance
of
the
spaniards
on
one
side
and
of
the
barbary
pirates
on
the
other
how
both
for
their
own
convenience
respected
it
as
neutral
ground
on
which
each
could
exchange
his
merchandise
without
let
or
hindrance
from
the
other
how
the
sort
of
sanctuary
thus
provided
was
never
violated
either
by
algerine
or
spaniard
but
each
was
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
pleased
and
this
did
somewhat
reassure
us
though
we
had
all
been
more
content
to
see
our
destination
on
the
crest
of
a
high
hill
from
this
point
we
came
in
less
than
half
an
hour
to
santa
pola
a
small
village
but
very
bustling
for
here
the
from
alicante
ends
all
transport
of
commodities
betwixt
this
and
elche
being
done
on
mules
so
here
great
commotion
of
carriers
setting
down
and
taking
up
merchandise
and
the
way
choked
with
carts
and
mules
and
a
very
babel
of
tongues
there
being
moors
here
as
well
as
spaniards
and
all
shouting
their
highest
to
be
the
better
understood
of
each
other
these
were
the
first
moors
we
had
seen
but
they
did
not
encourage
us
with
great
hopes
of
more
intimate
acquaintance
wearing
nothing
but
a
kind
of
long
ragged
shirt
to
their
heels
with
a
hood
for
their
heads
in
place
of
a
hat
and
all
mighty
foul
with
grease
and
dirt
being
astir
betimes
the
next
morning
we
reached
elche
before
midday
and
here
we
seemed
to
be
in
another
world
for
this
region
is
no
more
like
spain
than
spain
is
like
our
own
country
entering
the
forest
we
found
ourselves
encompassed
on
all
sides
by
prodigious
high
palm
trees
which
hitherto
we
had
seen
only
singly
here
and
there
cultivated
as
curiosities
and
noble
trees
they
are
standing
eighty
to
a
hundred
feet
high
with
never
a
branch
but
only
a
great
spreading
crown
of
leaves
with
strings
of
dates
hanging
down
from
their
midst
beneath
in
marshy
places
grew
as
high
as
any
haystack
and
elsewhere
were
patches
of
rice
which
grows
like
corn
with
us
but
thrives
well
in
the
shade
curiously
watered
by
artificial
streams
of
water
and
for
hedges
to
their
property
these
moors
have
agaves
with
great
spiky
leaves
which
no
man
can
penetrate
and
other
strange
plants
whereof
i
will
mention
only
one
they
call
the
fig
of
barbary
which
is
no
fig
at
all
but
a
thing
having
large
fleshy
leaves
growing
one
out
of
the
other
with
fruit
and
flower
sprouting
out
of
the
edges
and
all
monstrous
prickly
to
garnish
and
beautify
this
formidable
defence
nature
had
cast
over
all
a
network
of
creeping
herbs
with
most
extraordinary
flowers
delightful
both
to
see
and
smell
but
why
so
prickly
no
man
can
say
surely
this
must
be
paradise
cries
moll
staying
to
look
around
her
and
we
were
of
the
same
thinking
until
we
came
to
the
town
which
as
i
have
said
lies
in
the
midst
of
this
forest
and
then
all
our
hopes
and
expectations
were
dashed
to
the
ground
for
we
had
looked
to
find
a
city
in
keeping
with
these
surroundings
of
fairy
palaces
and
stately
mansions
in
place
whereof
was
nought
but
a
wilderness
of
mean
low
squalid
houses
with
meandering
alleys
and
all
past
everything
for
unsavoury
smells
heaps
of
refuse
lying
before
every
door
stark
naked
brats
of
children
screaming
everywhere
and
a
pack
of
famished
dogs
snapping
at
our
heels
don
sanchez
leads
the
way
we
following
with
rueful
looks
one
at
the
other
till
we
reach
the
and
there
he
takes
us
into
a
house
of
entertainment
where
a
dozen
moors
are
squatting
on
their
haunches
in
groups
about
sundry
bowls
of
a
smoking
mess
called
cuscusson
which
is
a
kind
of
paste
with
a
little
butter
in
it
and
a
store
of
spices
their
manner
of
eating
it
is
simple
enough
each
man
dips
his
hand
in
the
pot
takes
out
a
handful
and
dances
it
about
till
it
is
fashioned
into
a
ball
and
then
he
eats
it
with
all
the
gusto
in
the
world
for
our
repast
we
were
served
with
a
joint
of
roast
mutton
and
this
being
cut
up
we
had
to
take
up
in
our
hands
and
eat
like
any
savages
their
religion
denying
these
moors
anything
but
the
bare
necessities
of
life
also
their
law
forbids
the
drinking
of
wine
which
did
most
upset
jack
dawson
he
having
for
drink
with
his
meat
nothing
but
the
choice
of
water
and
sour
milk
but
which
he
liked
least
i
know
not
for
he
would
touch
neither
saying
he
would
rather
go
dry
any
day
than
be
poisoned
with
such
liquor
whilst
we
were
at
our
meal
a
good
many
moors
came
in
to
stare
at
us
as
at
a
raree
show
and
especially
at
moll
whose
bright
clothes
and
loose
hair
excited
their
curiosity
for
their
women
do
rarely
go
abroad
except
they
be
old
and
wear
only
long
dirty
white
robes
muffling
the
lower
part
of
their
faces
none
of
them
smiled
and
it
is
noticeable
that
these
people
like
our
own
don
do
never
laugh
taking
such
demonstration
as
a
sign
of
weak
understanding
and
foolishness
but
watching
all
our
actions
very
intently
and
presently
an
old
moor
with
a
white
beard
and
more
cleanly
dressed
than
the
rest
pushing
the
crowd
aside
to
see
what
was
forward
recognised
don
sanchez
who
at
once
rose
to
his
feet
we
not
to
be
behind
him
in
good
manners
rising
also
may
baba
says
the
old
moor
and
repeating
this
phrase
thrice
which
is
a
sure
sign
of
hearty
welcome
he
claps
the
don
hand
without
shaking
it
and
lays
his
own
upon
his
breast
the
don
doing
likewise
then
don
sanchez
introducing
us
as
we
understood
by
his
gestures
the
old
moor
bends
his
head
gravely
putting
his
right
hand
first
to
his
heart
next
to
his
forehead
and
then
kissing
the
two
foremost
fingers
laid
across
his
lips
we
replying
as
best
we
could
with
a
bowing
and
scraping
these
formalities
concluded
the
don
and
the
old
moor
walk
apart
and
we
squat
down
again
to
our
mutton
bones
after
a
lengthy
discussion
the
old
moor
goes
and
don
sanchez
having
paid
the
reckoning
leads
us
out
of
the
town
by
many
crooked
alleys
and
he
speaking
never
a
word
and
we
asking
no
questions
but
marvelling
exceedingly
what
is
to
happen
next
and
following
a
wall
overhung
by
great
palms
we
turn
a
corner
and
find
there
our
old
moor
standing
beside
an
open
door
with
a
key
in
his
hand
the
old
moor
gives
the
key
into
don
sanchez
hand
and
with
a
very
formal
salutation
leaves
us
then
following
the
don
through
the
doorway
we
find
ourselves
in
a
spacious
garden
but
quite
wild
for
neglect
flower
and
weed
and
fruit
all
mingling
madly
together
but
very
beautiful
to
my
eye
nevertheless
for
the
abundance
of
colour
the
richness
of
the
vegetables
and
the
graceful
forms
of
the
adjacent
palms
a
house
stood
in
the
midst
of
this
wilderness
and
thither
don
sanchez
picked
his
way
we
at
his
heels
still
too
amazed
to
speak
beside
the
house
was
a
well
with
a
little
wall
about
it
and
seating
himself
on
this
don
sanchez
opens
his
lips
for
the
first
time
my
friend
sidi
ben
ahmed
has
offered
me
the
use
of
this
place
as
long
as
we
choose
to
stay
here
says
he
go
look
in
the
house
and
tell
me
if
you
care
to
live
in
it
for
a
year
chapter
xii
don
sanchez
very
honestly
offers
to
free
us
of
our
bargain
if
we
will
but
we
will
the
house
like
nearly
all
moorish
houses
of
this
class
was
simply
one
large
and
lofty
room
with
a
domed
ceiling
built
of
very
thick
masonry
to
resist
the
heat
of
the
sun
there
was
neither
window
nor
chimney
the
door
serving
to
admit
light
and
air
and
let
out
the
smoke
if
a
fire
were
lighted
within
one
half
of
this
chamber
was
dug
out
to
a
depth
of
a
couple
of
feet
for
the
accommodation
of
cattle
the
litter
being
thrown
into
the
hollow
as
it
is
needed
and
nought
removed
till
it
reaches
the
level
of
the
other
floor
and
above
this
about
eight
feet
from
the
ground
and
four
from
the
roof
was
a
kind
of
shelf
the
breadth
and
length
of
that
half
for
the
storage
of
fodder
and
a
for
the
inhabitants
with
no
kind
of
partition
or
any
issue
for
the
foul
air
from
the
cattle
below
are
we
to
live
a
year
in
this
hutch
asks
moll
in
affright
have
done
with
your
chatter
moll
answers
jack
testily
do
you
see
i
heaven
knows
there
enough
to
swallow
without
any
bugbears
of
your
raising
with
that
having
finished
his
inspection
of
the
interior
he
goes
out
and
looks
at
it
outside
well
says
don
sanchez
what
think
you
of
the
house
why
señor
is
no
worse
as
i
can
see
than
any
other
in
these
parts
and
hath
this
advantage
which
they
have
not
of
being
in
a
sweet
air
with
a
bit
of
contrivance
we
could
make
a
shift
to
live
here
well
enough
we
should
not
do
amiss
neither
for
furniture
seeing
that
is
the
custom
of
the
country
to
eat
off
the
floor
and
sit
upon
nothing
a
pot
to
cook
victuals
in
is
about
all
we
need
in
that
way
but
how
we
are
to
get
anything
to
cook
in
it
is
one
mystery
and
clacking
his
tongue
what
we
are
going
to
drink
is
another
neither
of
which
i
can
fathom
for
look
you
señor
if
one
may
judge
of
men
characters
by
their
faces
or
of
their
means
by
their
habitations
we
may
dance
our
legs
off
ere
ever
these
moors
will
bestow
a
penny
piece
upon
us
and
as
for
their
sour
milk
i
as
lief
drink
hemlock
and
liefer
now
if
this
town
had
been
as
we
counted
on
like
barcelona
all
had
gone
as
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
for
then
might
we
have
gained
enough
to
keep
us
in
jollity
as
long
as
you
please
but
here
if
we
die
not
of
the
colicks
in
a
week
be
to
perish
of
starvation
in
a
fortnight
what
say
you
kit
i
was
forced
to
admit
that
i
had
never
seen
a
town
less
likely
to
afford
a
subsistence
than
this
then
don
sanchez
having
heard
us
with
great
patience
and
waited
a
minute
to
see
if
we
could
raise
any
further
objections
answers
us
in
measured
tones
i
doubt
not
says
he
that
with
a
little
ingenuity
you
may
make
the
house
habitable
and
this
wilderness
agreeable
my
friend
sidi
ben
ahmed
has
offered
to
provide
us
with
what
commodities
are
necessary
to
that
end
i
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
earn
the
meanest
livelihood
here
by
dancing
it
would
not
be
advisable
if
we
could
for
that
reason
my
knowledge
of
various
tongues
making
me
very
serviceable
to
sidi
ben
ahmed
who
is
the
most
considerable
merchant
of
this
town
i
have
accepted
an
office
in
his
house
this
will
enable
me
to
keep
my
engagement
with
you
you
will
live
at
my
charge
as
i
promised
and
you
shall
want
for
nothing
in
reason
if
the
moors
drink
no
wine
themselves
they
make
excellent
for
those
who
will
and
you
shall
not
be
stinted
in
that
particular
come
this
sounds
fair
enough
cries
dawson
but
pray
señor
are
we
to
do
nothing
for
our
keep
nothing
beyond
what
we
came
here
to
do
replies
he
with
a
meaning
glance
at
moll
what
cries
poor
moll
in
pain
we
are
to
dance
no
more
the
don
shook
his
head
gravely
and
remembering
the
jolly
vagabond
careless
adventurous
life
we
had
led
these
past
two
months
and
more
with
a
thousand
pleasant
incidents
of
our
happy
junketings
we
were
all
downcast
at
the
prospect
of
living
in
this
place
though
a
paradise
for
a
year
without
change
though
i
promised
you
no
more
than
i
offer
says
the
don
yet
if
this
prospect
displease
you
we
will
cry
quits
and
part
here
nay
adds
he
taking
a
purse
from
his
pocket
i
will
give
you
the
means
to
return
to
alicante
where
you
may
live
as
better
pleases
you
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
an
unfeigned
carelessness
in
his
manner
as
if
he
would
as
lief
as
not
throw
up
this
hazardous
enterprise
for
some
other
more
sure
undertaking
and
indeed
i
believe
he
was
then
balancing
another
alternative
in
his
mind
at
this
generous
offer
moll
dashed
away
the
tears
that
had
sprung
to
her
eyes
brightening
up
wonderfully
but
then
casting
her
eyes
upon
the
don
her
face
fell
again
as
at
the
thought
of
leaving
him
for
we
all
admired
him
and
she
prodigiously
for
his
great
reserve
and
many
good
qualities
which
commanded
respect
and
this
feeling
was
tinged
in
her
case
i
believe
with
a
kind
of
growing
affection
seeing
this
sentiment
in
her
eyes
the
don
was
clearly
touched
by
it
and
so
laying
his
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder
he
says
my
poor
child
remember
you
the
ugly
old
women
we
saw
dancing
at
barcelona
they
were
not
more
than
forty
what
will
they
be
like
in
a
few
years
who
will
tolerate
them
who
love
them
is
that
the
end
you
choose
for
your
own
life
that
the
estate
to
which
our
little
princess
shall
fall
no
no
no
cries
she
in
a
passion
clenching
her
little
hands
and
throwing
up
her
head
in
disdain
and
no
no
no
say
i
cries
dawson
were
our
case
ten
times
as
bad
i
not
go
back
from
my
word
as
it
is
we
are
not
to
be
pitied
and
i
warrant
ere
long
we
make
ourselves
to
be
envied
come
kit
rouse
you
out
of
your
lethargies
and
let
us
consult
how
we
may
improve
our
condition
here
and
do
you
señor
pray
order
us
a
little
of
that
same
excellent
wine
you
spoke
of
if
it
be
but
a
pint
when
you
feel
disposed
that
way
the
don
inclined
his
head
but
lingered
talking
to
moll
very
gravely
and
yet
tenderly
for
some
while
dawson
and
i
going
into
the
house
to
see
what
we
could
make
of
it
and
then
telling
us
we
should
see
him
no
more
till
the
next
day
he
left
us
but
for
some
time
after
he
was
gone
moll
sat
on
the
side
of
the
well
very
pensive
and
wistful
as
one
to
whom
the
future
was
opened
for
the
first
time
anon
comes
a
banging
at
our
garden
gate
which
moll
had
closed
behind
the
don
and
going
to
it
we
find
a
moorish
boy
with
a
barrow
charged
with
many
things
we
could
not
understand
a
word
he
said
but
dawson
decided
these
chattels
were
sent
us
by
the
don
by
perceiving
a
huge
hogskin
of
wine
for
which
he
thanked
god
and
don
sanchez
an
hundred
times
over
so
these
commodities
we
carried
up
to
the
house
marvelling
greatly
at
the
don
forethought
and
generosity
for
here
were
a
score
of
things
over
and
above
those
we
had
already
found
ourselves
lacking
namely
earthen
pipkins
and
wooden
vessels
a
bag
of
charcoal
a
box
of
carpenters
tools
which
did
greatly
like
dawson
he
having
been
bred
a
carpenter
in
his
youth
instruments
for
gardening
to
my
pleasure
as
i
have
ever
had
a
taste
for
such
employment
some
very
fine
moorish
blankets
etc
so
when
the
barrow
was
discharged
dawson
gives
the
lad
some
rials
out
of
his
pocket
which
pleased
him
also
mightily
then
first
of
all
dawson
unties
the
leg
of
the
hogskin
and
draws
off
a
quart
of
wine
very
carefully
securing
the
leg
after
and
this
we
drank
to
our
great
refreshment
and
next
moll
being
awoke
from
her
dreams
and
eager
to
be
doing
sets
herself
to
sort
out
our
goods
such
as
belong
to
us
as
tools
etc
on
one
side
and
such
as
belong
to
her
as
pipkins
and
the
rest
on
the
other
leaving
her
to
this
employment
dawson
and
i
armed
with
a
knife
and
bagging
hook
betake
ourselves
to
a
great
store
of
canes
stacked
in
one
corner
of
the
garden
and
sorting
out
those
most
proper
to
our
purpose
we
lopped
them
all
of
an
equal
length
and
shouldering
as
many
as
we
could
carried
them
up
to
our
house
here
we
found
moll
mighty
jubilant
in
having
got
her
work
done
and
admirably
she
had
done
it
to
be
sure
for
having
found
a
long
recess
in
the
wall
she
had
brushed
it
out
clean
with
a
whisp
of
herbs
and
stored
up
her
crocks
according
to
their
size
very
artificial
with
a
dish
of
oranges
plucked
from
the
tree
at
our
door
on
one
side
and
a
dish
of
almonds
on
the
other
a
pipkin
standing
betwixt
with
a
handsome
posey
of
roses
in
it
she
had
spread
a
mat
on
the
floor
and
folded
up
our
fine
blankets
to
serve
for
cushions
and
all
that
did
not
belong
to
her
she
had
bundled
out
of
sight
into
that
hollowed
side
i
have
mentioned
as
being
intended
for
cattle
after
we
had
sufficiently
admired
the
performance
she
told
us
she
had
a
mind
to
give
us
a
supper
of
broth
but
says
she
the
don
has
forgotten
that
we
must
eat
and
hath
sent
us
neither
bread
nor
flesh
nor
salt
this
put
us
to
a
stumble
for
how
to
get
these
things
we
knew
not
but
moll
declared
she
would
get
all
she
needed
if
we
could
only
find
the
money
why
how
asks
jack
you
know
not
their
gibberish
that
may
be
answers
she
but
i
warrant
the
same
language
that
bought
me
this
petticoat
will
get
us
a
supper
so
we
gave
her
what
money
we
had
and
she
went
off
with
as
much
confidence
as
if
she
were
a
born
barbary
moor
then
jack
falls
to
thanking
god
for
blessing
him
with
such
a
daughter
at
the
same
time
taking
no
small
credit
to
himself
for
having
bred
her
to
such
perfection
and
in
the
midst
of
his
encomiums
being
down
in
the
hollow
searching
for
his
hammer
he
cries
plague
take
the
careless
baggage
she
has
spilled
all
our
nails
and
here
an
hour
work
to
pick
up
this
accident
was
repaired
however
and
moll
transgression
forgotten
when
she
returned
with
an
old
woman
carrying
her
purchases
then
were
we
forced
to
admire
her
skill
in
this
business
for
she
had
bought
all
that
was
needful
for
a
couple
of
meals
and
yet
had
spent
but
half
our
money
now
arose
the
difficult
question
how
to
make
a
fire
and
this
jack
left
us
to
settle
by
our
own
devices
he
returning
to
his
own
occupation
moll
resolved
we
should
do
our
cooking
outside
the
house
so
here
we
built
up
a
kind
of
grate
with
stones
and
contriving
to
strike
a
spark
with
the
back
of
a
and
a
stone
upon
a
heap
of
dried
leaves
we
presently
blew
up
a
fine
flame
and
feeding
this
with
the
ends
of
cane
we
had
cut
and
some
charcoal
we
at
last
got
a
royal
fire
on
which
to
set
our
pot
of
mutton
and
into
this
pot
we
put
rice
and
a
multitude
of
herbs
from
the
garden
which
by
the
taste
we
thought
might
serve
to
make
a
savoury
mess
and
indeed
when
it
began
to
boil
the
odour
was
so
agreeable
that
we
would
have
jack
come
out
to
smell
it
and
he
having
praised
it
very
highly
we
in
return
went
in
to
look
at
his
handiwork
and
praise
that
this
we
could
do
very
heartily
and
without
hypocrisy
for
he
had
worked
well
and
made
a
rare
good
job
having
built
a
very
seemly
partition
across
the
room
by
nailing
of
the
canes
perpendicularly
to
that
kind
of
floor
that
hung
over
the
hollowed
portion
thus
making
us
now
three
rooms
out
of
one
at
one
end
he
had
left
an
opening
to
enter
the
cavity
below
and
the
floor
above
by
the
little
ladder
that
stood
there
and
these
canes
were
set
not
so
close
together
but
that
air
and
light
could
pass
betwixt
them
and
yet
from
the
outer
side
no
eye
could
see
within
which
was
very
commodious
also
upon
the
floor
above
he
had
found
sundry
bundles
of
soft
dried
leaves
and
these
opened
out
upon
the
surface
of
both
chambers
made
a
very
sweet
convenient
bed
upon
which
to
lie
then
dawson
offering
moll
her
choice
she
took
the
upper
floor
for
her
chamber
leaving
us
two
the
lower
and
so
it
being
near
sundown
by
this
time
we
to
our
supper
in
the
sweet
cool
air
of
evening
all
mightily
content
with
one
another
and
not
less
satisfied
with
our
stew
which
was
indeed
most
savoury
and
palatable
this
done
we
took
a
turn
round
our
little
domain
admiring
the
many
strange
and
wonderful
things
that
grew
there
especially
the
figs
which
though
yet
green
were
wondrous
pleasant
to
eat
and
i
laying
out
my
plans
for
the
morrow
how
to
get
this
wilderness
into
order
tear
out
the
worthless
herbs
dig
the
soil
thoughts
running
on
the
building
of
an
outhouse
for
the
accommodation
of
our
wine
tools
and
such
like
and
moll
meditating
on
dishes
to
give
us
for
our
repasts
and
at
length
when
these
divers
subjects
were
no
more
to
be
discussed
we
turned
into
our
dormitories
and
fell
asleep
mighty
tired
but
as
happy
as
princes
chapter
xiii
brief
summary
of
those
twelve
months
we
spent
at
the
surprising
activity
with
which
we
attacked
our
domestic
business
at
elche
lasted
about
two
days
and
a
half
dawson
labouring
at
his
shed
i
at
the
cultivation
of
the
garden
and
moll
quitting
her
cooking
and
household
affairs
as
occasion
permitted
to
lend
a
helping
hand
first
to
her
father
and
then
to
me
and
as
man
when
this
fever
of
enterprise
is
upon
him
must
for
ever
be
seeking
to
add
to
his
cares
we
persuaded
don
sanchez
to
let
us
have
two
to
stall
in
the
shed
and
consume
our
waste
herbage
that
we
might
have
milk
and
get
butter
which
they
do
in
these
parts
by
shaking
the
cream
in
a
skin
bag
a
method
that
seems
simple
enough
till
you
have
been
shaking
the
bag
for
twenty
minutes
in
vain
on
a
sultry
morning
without
cost
but
the
novelty
of
the
thing
wearing
off
our
eagerness
rapidly
subsided
and
so
about
the
third
day
as
i
say
the
heat
being
prodigious
we
toiled
with
no
spirit
at
all
dawson
was
the
first
to
speak
his
mind
says
he
coming
to
me
whilst
i
was
still
sweating
over
my
shovel
i
done
it
but
hang
me
if
i
do
more
there
a
good
piece
of
work
worth
thirty
shillings
of
any
man
money
but
who
give
me
a
thank
ye
for
it
when
we
leave
here
next
year
and
then
he
can
find
nothing
better
to
do
than
fall
on
my
labours
saying
there
was
but
precious
little
to
show
for
my
efforts
that
had
he
been
in
my
place
he
would
have
ordered
matters
otherwise
and
begun
digging
end
wagering
that
i
should
give
up
my
job
before
it
was
quarter
done
all
which
was
mighty
discouraging
and
the
more
unpleasant
because
i
felt
there
was
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
what
he
said
consequently
i
felt
a
certain
malicious
enjoyment
the
next
morning
upon
finding
that
the
goats
had
burst
out
one
side
of
his
famous
shed
and
got
loose
into
the
garden
which
enabled
me
to
wonder
that
two
such
feeble
creatures
could
undo
such
a
good
thirty
shillings
worth
of
work
etc
but
ere
i
was
done
galling
him
i
myself
was
mortified
exceedingly
to
find
these
mischievous
brutes
had
torn
up
all
the
plants
i
had
set
by
the
trees
in
the
shade
as
worthy
of
cultivation
which
gave
jack
a
chance
for
jibing
at
me
but
that
which
embittered
us
as
much
as
anything
was
to
have
moll
holding
her
sides
for
laughter
at
our
attempts
to
catch
these
two
devilish
goats
which
to
our
cost
we
found
were
not
so
feeble
after
all
for
getting
one
up
in
a
corner
she
raises
herself
up
on
her
hind
legs
and
brings
her
skull
down
with
such
a
smack
on
my
knee
that
i
truly
thought
she
had
broke
my
whilst
taking
dawson
in
the
ankles
with
her
horns
as
he
was
reaching
forward
to
lay
hold
of
her
lay
him
sprawling
in
our
little
stream
of
water
nor
do
i
think
we
should
ever
have
captured
them
but
that
giving
over
our
endeavours
from
sheer
fatigue
they
of
their
own
accord
sauntered
into
the
shed
for
shelter
from
the
sun
where
moll
clapt
to
the
door
upon
them
and
set
her
back
against
the
gap
in
the
side
until
her
father
came
with
a
hammer
and
some
stout
nails
to
secure
the
planks
so
for
the
rest
of
that
day
jack
and
i
lay
on
our
backs
in
the
shade
doing
nothing
but
exceedingly
sore
one
against
the
other
for
these
mischances
but
our
heart
burnings
ended
not
there
for
coming
in
to
supper
at
sundown
moll
has
nothing
to
offer
us
but
dry
bread
and
a
dish
of
dates
which
though
it
be
the
common
supper
of
the
moors
in
this
place
was
little
enough
to
our
satisfaction
as
dawson
told
her
in
pretty
round
terms
asking
her
what
she
was
good
for
if
not
to
give
us
a
meal
fit
for
christians
and
stating
very
explicitly
what
he
would
have
her
prepare
for
our
dinner
next
day
moll
takes
her
upbraiding
very
humbly
which
was
ever
a
bad
sign
and
promises
to
be
more
careful
of
our
comfort
in
the
future
and
so
ended
that
day
the
next
morning
dawson
and
i
make
no
attempt
at
work
but
after
breakfast
by
common
accord
stretch
us
out
under
the
palms
to
meditate
and
there
about
half
past
ten
don
sanchez
coming
round
to
pay
us
a
visit
finds
us
both
sound
asleep
a
sudden
exclamation
from
him
aroused
us
and
as
we
stumbled
to
our
feet
staring
about
us
we
perceived
moll
coming
from
the
house
but
so
disfigured
with
smuts
of
charcoal
all
over
her
face
and
hands
we
scarce
knew
her
god
mercy
cries
the
don
what
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
child
to
which
moll
replies
with
a
curtsey
i
am
learning
to
be
a
señor
at
my
father
desire
you
are
here
answers
the
don
with
a
frown
to
learn
to
be
a
lady
if
a
is
necessary
you
shall
have
one
this
to
us
and
anything
else
that
my
means
may
afford
you
will
do
well
to
write
me
a
list
of
your
requirements
but
observe
adds
he
turning
on
his
heel
we
may
have
to
stay
here
another
twelvemonth
if
my
economies
are
not
sufficient
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
to
take
us
hence
this
hint
brought
us
to
our
senses
very
quickly
and
overtaking
him
ere
he
reached
our
garden
gate
dawson
and
i
assured
the
don
we
had
no
need
of
any
servant
and
would
be
careful
that
moll
henceforth
did
no
menial
office
that
we
would
tax
his
generosity
no
more
than
we
could
help
to
our
great
humiliation
when
we
came
to
reflect
on
our
conduct
thenceforth
dawson
charged
himself
with
the
internal
economy
of
the
house
and
i
with
that
part
which
concerned
the
custody
and
care
of
the
goats
the
cultivation
of
and
with
such
instruction
of
moll
in
the
italian
tongue
as
i
could
command
but
to
tell
the
truth
we
neither
of
us
did
one
stroke
of
work
beyond
what
was
absolutely
necessary
and
especially
dawson
being
past
everything
for
indolence
did
so
order
his
part
that
from
having
two
dishes
of
flesh
a
day
we
came
ere
long
to
getting
but
one
mess
a
week
he
forcing
himself
and
us
to
be
content
with
dates
and
bread
for
our
repasts
rather
than
give
himself
the
trouble
of
boiling
a
pot
beyond
browsing
my
goats
drawing
their
milk
the
making
of
butter
i
quickly
renounced
and
watering
my
garden
night
and
morn
which
is
done
by
throwing
water
from
the
little
stream
broadcast
with
a
shovel
on
either
side
i
did
no
more
than
dawson
but
joined
him
in
yawning
the
day
away
for
which
my
sole
excuse
is
the
great
heat
of
this
region
which
doth
beget
most
slothful
humours
in
those
matured
in
cooler
climes
with
moll
however
the
case
was
otherwise
for
she
being
young
and
of
an
exceeding
vivacious
active
disposition
must
for
ever
be
doing
of
something
and
lucky
for
us
when
it
was
not
some
mischievous
trick
at
our
expense
as
letting
the
goats
loose
shaking
lemons
down
on
our
heads
as
we
lay
asleep
beneath
it
and
the
like
being
greatly
smitten
with
the
appearance
of
the
moorish
women
who
though
they
are
not
permitted
to
wander
about
at
will
like
our
women
are
yet
suffered
to
fetch
water
from
the
public
fountains
she
surprised
us
one
morning
by
coming
forth
dressed
in
their
mode
and
this
dress
which
seems
to
be
nought
but
a
long
sheet
wound
loosely
twice
or
thrice
about
the
body
buckled
on
the
shoulder
with
holes
for
the
arms
to
be
put
through
in
the
manner
of
the
old
greeks
became
her
surprisingly
and
we
noticed
then
for
the
first
time
that
her
arms
were
rounder
and
fuller
than
when
we
had
last
seen
them
bare
then
to
get
the
graceful
noble
bearing
of
the
moors
she
practised
day
after
day
carrying
a
pitcher
of
water
on
her
head
as
they
do
until
she
could
do
this
with
perfect
ease
and
sureness
in
this
habit
the
don
who
was
mightily
pleased
with
her
looks
took
her
to
the
house
of
his
friend
and
employer
sidi
ben
ahmed
where
she
ingratiated
herself
so
greatly
with
the
women
of
his
household
that
they
would
have
her
come
to
them
again
the
next
day
and
after
that
the
next
indeed
thenceforth
she
spent
far
more
of
her
time
with
these
new
friends
than
with
us
and
here
from
the
necessity
of
making
herself
understood
together
with
an
excellent
memory
and
a
natural
aptitude
she
learned
to
speak
the
moorish
tongue
in
a
marvellously
short
space
of
time
dawson
and
i
were
frequently
asked
to
accompany
moll
and
we
went
twice
to
this
house
which
though
nothing
at
all
to
look
at
outside
was
very
magnificently
furnished
within
and
the
entertainment
most
noble
but
lord
was
the
most
tedious
wearisome
business
for
us
who
could
make
out
never
a
word
of
the
civil
speeches
offered
us
without
the
aid
of
don
sanchez
and
moll
and
then
could
think
of
no
witty
response
but
could
only
sit
there
grinning
like
gog
and
magog
still
it
gave
us
vast
pleasure
to
see
how
moll
carried
herself
with
this
company
talking
as
freely
as
they
yet
holding
herself
with
the
dignity
of
an
equal
and
delighting
all
by
her
vivacity
and
sly
pretty
ways
illustration
she
practised
day
after
day
by
carrying
a
pitcher
of
water
on
her
head
i
think
no
country
in
europe
can
be
richer
than
this
elche
in
fruits
and
vegetation
more
beautiful
in
its
surrounding
aspects
of
plain
and
mountain
more
blessed
with
constant
glorious
sunlight
and
the
effect
of
these
charms
upon
the
quick
receptive
spirit
of
our
molly
was
like
a
gentle
may
upon
a
nightingale
so
that
the
days
were
all
too
short
for
her
enjoyment
and
she
must
need
vent
her
happiness
in
song
but
on
us
they
made
no
more
impression
than
on
two
owls
in
a
tower
nay
if
anything
they
did
add
to
that
weariness
which
arose
from
our
lack
of
occupation
for
here
was
no
contrast
in
our
lives
one
day
being
as
like
another
as
two
peas
in
a
pod
and
having
no
sort
of
adversities
to
give
savour
to
our
ease
we
found
existence
the
most
flat
insipid
dull
thing
possible
i
remember
how
on
christmas
day
dawson
did
cry
out
against
the
warm
sunshine
as
a
thing
contrary
to
nature
wishing
he
might
stand
up
to
his
knees
in
snow
in
a
whistling
wind
and
taking
up
the
crock
moll
had
filled
with
roses
which
here
bloom
more
fully
in
the
depth
of
winter
than
with
us
in
the
height
of
summer
he
flung
it
out
of
the
door
with
a
curse
for
an
unchristian
thing
to
have
in
the
house
on
such
a
day
as
soon
as
the
year
had
turned
we
began
to
count
the
days
to
our
departure
and
thenceforth
we
could
think
of
nought
but
what
we
would
do
with
our
fortune
when
we
got
it
and
the
evenings
being
long
we
would
set
the
bag
of
wine
betwixt
us
after
our
supper
of
dates
and
sit
there
for
hours
discussing
our
several
projects
moll
being
with
us
for
in
these
parts
no
womankind
may
be
abroad
after
sundown
she
would
take
part
in
these
debates
with
as
much
gusto
as
we
for
though
she
was
not
wearied
of
her
life
here
as
we
were
yet
she
was
possessed
of
a
very
stirring
spirit
of
adventure
and
her
quick
imagination
furnished
endless
visions
of
lively
pleasures
and
sumptuous
living
we
agreed
that
we
would
live
together
and
share
everything
in
common
as
one
family
but
not
in
such
an
outlandish
spot
as
chislehurst
that
estate
we
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
but
selling
it
at
once
have
in
its
place
two
houses
one
city
house
in
the
cheap
and
a
country
house
not
further
from
town
than
bednal
green
or
clerkenwell
at
the
outside
to
the
end
that
when
we
were
fatigued
with
the
pleasures
of
the
town
we
might
by
an
easy
journey
resort
to
the
tranquillity
of
rural
life
dawson
declaring
what
wines
he
would
have
laid
down
in
our
cellars
i
what
books
should
furnish
our
library
and
moll
what
dresses
she
would
wear
not
less
than
one
for
every
month
of
the
year
what
coaches
and
horses
we
should
keep
what
liveries
our
servants
should
wear
what
entertainments
we
would
give
and
so
forth
don
sanchez
was
not
excluded
from
our
deliberations
indeed
he
encouraged
us
greatly
by
approving
of
all
our
plans
only
stipulating
that
we
would
guard
one
room
for
him
in
each
of
our
houses
that
he
might
feel
at
home
in
our
society
whenever
he
chanced
to
be
in
our
neighbourhood
in
all
these
arguments
there
was
never
one
word
of
question
from
any
of
us
as
to
the
honesty
of
our
design
we
had
settled
that
once
and
for
all
before
starting
on
this
expedition
and
since
then
little
by
little
we
had
come
to
regard
the
godwin
estate
as
a
natural
gift
as
freely
to
be
taken
as
a
blackberry
from
the
hedge
nay
i
believe
dawson
and
i
would
have
contested
our
right
to
it
by
reason
of
the
pains
we
were
taking
to
possess
it
and
now
being
in
the
month
of
june
and
our
year
of
exile
as
it
liked
us
to
call
it
nigh
at
an
end
dawson
one
night
put
the
question
to
don
sanchez
which
had
kept
us
fluttering
in
painful
suspense
these
past
six
months
whether
he
had
saved
sufficient
by
his
labours
to
enable
us
to
return
to
england
ere
long
yes
says
he
gravely
at
which
we
did
all
heave
one
long
sigh
of
relief
i
learn
that
a
convoy
of
english
ships
is
about
to
sail
from
alicante
in
the
beginning
of
july
and
if
we
are
happy
enough
to
find
a
favourable
opportunity
we
will
certainly
embark
in
one
of
them
pray
señor
says
i
what
may
that
opportunity
be
for
is
but
two
days
march
hence
to
alicante
and
we
may
do
it
with
a
light
foot
in
one
the
opportunity
i
speak
of
answers
he
is
the
arrival
from
algeria
of
a
company
of
pirates
whose
good
service
i
hope
to
engage
in
putting
us
aboard
an
english
ship
under
a
flag
of
truce
as
redeemed
slaves
from
barbary
pirates
cry
we
in
a
low
breath
what
señor
adds
dawson
are
we
to
trust
ourselves
to
the
mercy
and
honesty
of
barbary
pirates
on
the
open
sea
i
would
rather
trust
to
their
honesty
answers
the
don
dropping
his
voice
that
he
might
not
be
heard
by
moll
who
was
leading
home
the
goats
than
to
the
mercy
of
an
english
judge
if
we
should
be
brought
to
trial
with
insufficient
evidence
to
support
our
story
jack
and
i
stared
at
each
other
aghast
at
this
talk
of
trial
which
had
never
once
entered
into
our
reckoning
of
probabilities
if
i
know
aught
of
my
continues
the
don
surely
and
slow
that
grasping
steward
will
not
yield
up
his
trust
before
he
has
made
searching
enquiry
into
moll
claim
act
she
her
part
never
so
well
we
can
not
refuse
to
give
him
the
name
of
the
ship
that
brought
us
home
and
learning
that
we
embarked
at
alicante
jealous
suspicion
may
lead
him
to
seek
further
information
there
with
what
result
why
we
may
be
blown
with
a
vengeance
if
he
come
ferreting
so
nigh
as
that
says
dawson
and
we
are
like
to
rot
in
gaol
for
our
pains
you
may
choose
to
run
that
risk
i
will
not
says
the
don
nor
i
either
says
dawson
and
god
forgive
me
for
overlooking
such
a
peril
to
my
moll
but
do
tell
me
plainly
señor
granting
these
pirates
be
the
most
honest
thieves
in
the
world
is
there
no
other
risk
to
fear
the
don
hunched
his
shoulders
life
itself
is
a
game
says
he
in
which
the
meanest
stroke
may
not
be
won
without
some
risk
but
played
as
i
direct
the
odds
are
in
our
favour
picked
up
at
sea
from
an
algerine
boat
who
shall
deny
our
story
when
the
evidence
against
us
lies
there
laying
his
hand
out
towards
the
south
where
no
man
in
england
dare
venture
to
seek
it
why
to
be
sure
says
dawson
that
way
all
hangs
together
to
a
nicety
for
only
a
wizard
could
dream
of
coming
hither
for
our
undoing
for
the
rest
continues
the
don
thoughtfully
there
is
little
to
fear
judith
godwin
has
eyes
the
colour
of
moll
and
in
all
else
simon
must
expect
to
find
a
change
since
he
last
saw
his
master
daughter
they
were
in
italy
three
years
that
would
make
judith
a
lisping
child
when
she
left
england
he
must
look
to
find
her
altered
why
adds
he
in
a
more
gentle
voice
as
if
moved
by
some
inner
feeling
of
affection
and
admiration
nodding
towards
moll
see
how
she
has
changed
in
this
little
while
i
should
not
know
her
for
the
raw
spindle
of
a
thing
she
was
when
i
saw
her
first
playing
in
the
barn
at
tottenham
cross
looking
at
her
now
browsing
the
goats
amongst
my
most
cherished
herbs
i
was
struck
also
by
this
fact
which
living
with
her
day
by
day
had
slipped
my
observation
somewhat
she
was
no
longer
a
gaunt
ungainly
child
but
a
young
woman
well
proportioned
with
a
rounded
cheek
and
chin
brown
tinted
by
the
sun
and
to
my
mind
more
beautiful
than
any
of
their
vaunted
moorish
women
but
indeed
in
this
country
all
things
do
mature
quickly
and
was
less
surprising
in
her
case
because
her
growth
had
been
checked
before
by
privation
and
hardship
whereas
since
our
coming
hither
it
had
been
aided
by
easy
circumstances
and
good
living
chapter
xiv
our
coming
to
london
with
incidents
by
the
way
and
of
the
great
address
whereby
moll
confounds
simon
the
on
the
third
day
of
july
all
things
falling
in
pat
with
the
design
we
bade
farewell
to
elche
dawson
and
i
with
no
sort
of
regret
but
moll
in
tears
at
parting
from
those
friends
she
had
grown
to
love
very
heartily
and
these
friends
would
each
have
her
take
away
something
for
a
keepsake
such
as
rings
to
wear
on
her
arms
and
on
her
ankles
as
is
the
moorish
fashion
silk
shawls
so
that
she
had
quite
a
large
present
of
finery
to
carry
away
but
we
had
nothing
whatever
but
the
clothes
we
stood
in
and
they
of
the
scantiest
being
simply
long
shirts
and
bernouses
such
as
common
moors
wear
for
the
wise
don
would
let
us
take
nought
that
might
betray
our
sojourn
in
spain
making
us
even
change
our
boots
for
wooden
sandals
he
himself
being
arrayed
no
better
than
we
nor
was
this
the
only
change
insisted
on
by
our
governor
for
on
dawson
bidding
moll
in
a
surly
tone
to
give
over
a
shedding
of
tears
don
sanchez
turns
upon
him
and
says
he
it
is
time
to
rehearse
the
parts
we
are
to
play
from
this
day
forth
your
daughter
is
mistress
judith
godwin
you
are
captain
robert
evans
and
you
to
me
hopkins
the
merchant
let
us
each
play
our
part
with
care
that
we
do
not
betray
ourselves
by
a
slip
in
a
moment
of
unforeseen
danger
you
are
in
the
right
señor
answers
jack
for
i
doubt
it
must
be
a
hard
task
to
forget
that
mistress
judith
is
my
daughter
as
it
is
for
a
loving
father
to
hold
from
chiding
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
so
i
pray
you
madam
to
moll
bear
that
in
mind
and
vex
me
no
more
we
lay
this
lesson
seriously
to
heart
dawson
and
i
for
the
don
hint
that
we
might
end
our
career
in
gaol
did
still
rankle
woundily
in
our
minds
and
so
very
soberly
we
went
out
of
the
forest
of
elche
in
the
night
on
mules
lent
us
by
sidi
ben
ahmed
with
a
long
cavalcade
of
mules
charged
with
merchandise
for
embarking
on
board
the
pirates
vessel
and
an
escort
of
some
corsairs
armed
with
long
firelocks
and
a
great
store
of
awesome
crooked
knives
stuck
in
their
after
journeying
across
the
plain
we
came
about
midday
to
the
seaboard
and
there
we
spied
lying
in
a
sheltered
bay
a
long
galley
with
three
masts
each
dressed
with
a
single
for
carrying
a
sail
and
on
the
shore
a
couple
of
ship
boats
with
a
company
of
men
waiting
to
transport
our
goods
and
us
aboard
and
here
our
hearts
quaked
a
bit
at
the
thought
of
trusting
ourselves
in
the
hands
of
these
same
pirates
nevertheless
when
our
time
came
we
got
us
into
their
boat
recommending
ourselves
very
heartily
to
god
mercy
and
so
were
rowed
out
to
the
galley
where
we
were
very
civilly
received
by
an
old
moor
with
a
white
beard
who
seemed
well
acquainted
with
don
sanchez
then
the
merchandise
being
all
aboard
and
the
anchor
up
the
men
went
to
their
oars
a
dozen
of
each
side
and
rowed
us
out
of
the
bay
until
catching
a
little
wind
of
air
the
sails
were
run
up
and
we
put
out
to
sea
very
bravely
señor
says
dawson
i
know
not
how
i
am
to
play
this
part
of
a
when
we
are
sent
on
board
an
english
ship
for
if
they
ask
me
any
questions
on
this
business
of
navigating
i
am
done
for
a
certainty
rest
easy
on
that
score
evans
replies
the
don
i
will
answer
for
you
for
i
see
very
clearly
by
your
complexion
that
you
will
soon
be
past
answering
them
yourself
and
this
forecast
was
quickly
verified
for
ere
the
galley
had
dipped
a
dozen
times
to
the
waves
poor
dawson
was
laid
low
with
a
most
horrid
sickness
like
any
dying
man
by
sundown
we
sighted
the
island
of
maggiore
and
in
the
roads
there
we
cast
anchor
for
the
night
setting
sail
again
at
daybreak
and
in
this
latitude
we
beat
up
and
down
a
day
and
a
night
without
seeing
any
sail
but
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
a
fleet
of
five
big
ships
appeared
to
the
eastward
and
shifting
our
course
we
bore
down
upon
them
with
amazing
swiftness
then
when
we
were
near
enough
to
the
foremast
to
see
her
english
flag
and
the
men
aboard
standing
to
their
deck
guns
for
a
defence
our
old
moor
fires
a
gun
in
the
air
takes
in
his
sails
and
runs
up
a
great
white
flag
for
a
sign
of
peace
and
now
with
shrewd
haste
a
boat
was
lowered
and
we
were
set
in
it
with
a
pair
of
oars
and
the
old
pirate
bidding
us
farewell
in
his
tongue
clapt
on
all
sail
and
stood
out
before
the
wind
leaving
us
there
to
shift
for
ourselves
don
sanchez
took
one
oar
and
i
dawson
lying
in
the
bottom
and
not
able
to
move
a
hand
to
save
his
life
and
moll
held
the
tiller
and
so
we
pulled
with
all
our
force
crying
out
now
and
then
for
fear
we
should
not
be
seen
till
by
god
providence
we
came
alongside
the
talbot
of
london
and
were
presently
hoisted
aboard
without
mishap
then
the
captain
of
the
talbot
and
his
officers
gathering
about
us
were
mighty
curious
to
know
our
story
and
don
sanchez
very
briefly
told
how
we
had
gone
in
the
red
rose
of
bristol
to
redeem
two
ladies
from
slavery
how
we
had
found
but
one
of
these
ladies
living
at
this
moll
buries
her
face
in
her
hands
as
if
stricken
with
grief
how
on
the
eve
of
our
departure
some
of
our
crew
in
a
drunken
frolic
had
drowned
a
turk
of
alger
for
which
we
were
condemned
by
their
court
to
pay
an
indemnity
far
and
away
beyond
our
means
how
they
then
made
this
a
pretext
to
seize
our
things
though
we
were
properly
furnished
with
the
pass
and
hold
our
men
in
bond
and
how
having
plundered
us
of
all
we
had
and
seeing
there
was
no
more
to
be
got
they
did
offer
us
our
freedom
for
a
written
quittance
of
all
they
had
taken
for
their
justification
if
ever
they
should
be
brought
to
court
and
finally
how
accepting
of
these
conditions
we
were
shipped
aboard
their
galley
with
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
few
trifles
begged
by
mistress
judith
in
remembrance
of
her
mother
this
story
was
accepted
without
any
demur
nay
captain
ballcock
being
one
of
those
men
who
must
ever
appear
to
know
all
things
supported
it
in
many
doubtful
particulars
saying
that
he
remembered
the
rose
of
bristol
quite
well
that
he
himself
had
seen
a
whole
ship
crew
sold
into
slavery
for
no
greater
offence
than
breaking
a
mosque
window
that
the
duke
pass
counted
for
nothing
with
these
turks
that
he
knew
the
galley
we
were
brought
in
as
well
as
he
knew
paul
church
having
chased
it
a
dozen
times
yet
never
got
within
gunshot
for
her
swift
sailing
which
did
much
content
us
to
hear
but
the
officers
were
mighty
curious
to
know
what
ailed
captain
robert
evans
meaning
dawson
fearing
he
might
be
ill
of
the
plague
however
on
the
don
vowing
that
he
was
only
sick
of
a
surfeit
captain
ballcock
declared
he
had
guessed
it
the
moment
he
clapt
eyes
on
him
as
he
himself
had
been
taken
of
the
same
complaint
with
only
eating
a
dish
of
pease
pudding
nevertheless
he
ordered
the
sick
man
to
be
laid
in
a
part
of
the
ship
furthest
from
his
quarters
and
so
great
was
the
dread
of
pestilence
aboard
that
as
his
sickness
continued
not
a
soul
would
venture
near
him
during
the
whole
voyage
except
ourselves
which
also
fell
in
very
well
with
our
wishes
and
so
after
a
fairly
prosperous
voyage
we
came
up
the
thames
to
chatham
the
third
day
of
august
we
had
been
provided
with
some
rough
seamen
clothes
for
our
better
covering
on
the
voyage
but
now
being
landed
and
lodged
in
the
crown
inn
at
chatham
don
sanchez
would
have
the
captain
take
them
all
back
but
says
he
if
you
will
do
us
yet
another
favour
captain
will
you
suffer
one
of
your
men
to
carry
a
letter
to
mistress
godwin
steward
at
chislehurst
that
he
may
come
hither
to
relieve
us
from
our
present
straits
aye
answers
he
i
will
take
the
letter
gladly
myself
for
nothing
pleases
me
better
than
a
ramble
in
the
country
where
i
was
born
and
bred
so
moll
writes
a
letter
at
once
to
simon
bidding
him
come
at
once
to
her
relief
and
captain
ballcock
after
carefully
enquiring
his
way
to
this
place
he
knew
so
well
as
he
would
have
us
believe
starts
off
with
it
accompanied
by
his
boatswain
a
kind
of
who
never
failed
to
back
up
his
captain
assertions
which
again
was
to
our
great
advantage
for
simon
would
thus
learn
our
story
from
his
lips
and
find
no
room
to
doubt
its
veracity
as
soon
as
these
two
were
out
of
the
house
dawson
who
had
been
carried
from
the
ship
and
laid
in
bed
though
as
hale
since
we
passed
the
godwins
as
ever
he
was
in
his
life
before
sprang
up
and
declared
he
would
go
to
bed
no
more
for
all
the
fortunes
in
the
world
till
he
had
supped
on
roast
pork
and
onions
this
being
a
dish
he
greatly
loved
but
not
to
be
had
at
elche
because
the
moors
by
their
religion
forbid
the
use
of
swine
flesh
and
seeing
him
very
determined
on
this
head
don
sanchez
ordered
a
leg
of
pork
to
be
served
in
our
chamber
whereof
dawson
did
eat
such
a
prodigious
quantity
and
drank
therewith
such
a
vast
quantity
of
strong
ale
which
he
protested
was
the
only
liquor
an
englishman
could
drink
with
any
satisfaction
that
in
the
night
he
was
seized
with
most
severe
cramp
in
his
stomach
this
gave
us
the
occasion
to
send
for
a
doctor
in
the
morning
who
learning
that
jack
had
been
ill
ever
since
we
left
barbary
and
not
understanding
his
present
complaint
pulled
a
very
long
face
and
declaring
his
case
was
very
critical
bled
him
copiously
forbade
him
to
leave
his
bed
for
another
fortnight
and
sent
him
in
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
physic
about
midday
he
returns
and
finding
his
patient
no
better
administers
a
bolus
and
while
we
are
all
standing
about
the
bed
and
dawson
the
colour
of
death
and
groaning
betwixt
the
nausea
of
the
drug
he
had
swallowed
and
the
cramp
in
his
inwards
in
comes
our
captain
ballcock
and
the
little
steward
there
cries
he
turning
on
simon
did
not
i
tell
you
that
my
old
friend
evans
lay
at
death
door
with
the
treatment
he
hath
received
of
these
barbary
pirates
now
will
you
be
putting
us
off
with
your
doubts
and
your
questionings
shall
i
have
up
my
ship
company
to
testify
to
the
truth
of
my
history
look
you
madam
to
moll
we
had
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
make
this
steward
of
yours
do
your
bidding
but
he
should
have
come
though
we
had
to
bring
him
by
the
neck
and
heels
and
a
pox
to
him
saving
your
presence
but
this
is
not
simon
says
moll
with
a
pretty
air
of
innocence
i
seem
to
remember
simon
a
bigger
man
than
he
you
must
consider
madam
says
don
sanchez
that
then
you
were
very
small
scarce
higher
than
his
waist
maybe
and
so
you
would
have
to
look
up
into
his
face
i
did
not
think
of
that
and
are
you
really
simon
who
used
to
scold
me
for
plucking
fruit
yea
verily
answers
he
doubt
it
not
for
thou
also
hast
changed
beyond
conception
and
so
it
hath
come
to
pass
he
adds
staring
round
at
us
in
our
moorish
garb
like
one
bewildered
and
thou
art
my
mistress
now
turning
again
to
moll
alas
says
she
bowing
her
head
and
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hand
ha
i
told
you
so
unbelieving
jew
quaker
growls
captain
ballcock
in
exasperation
why
will
you
plague
the
unhappy
lady
with
her
loss
we
will
leave
evans
to
repose
says
moll
brushing
her
eyes
and
turning
to
the
door
you
will
save
his
life
doctor
for
he
has
given
me
mine
the
doctor
vowed
he
would
if
bleeding
and
boluses
could
make
him
whole
and
so
leaving
him
with
poor
groaning
dawson
we
went
into
the
next
chamber
and
there
captain
ballcock
was
for
taking
his
leave
but
moll
detaining
him
says
we
owe
you
something
more
than
gratitude
we
have
put
you
to
much
expense
nay
cries
he
i
will
take
nought
for
doing
a
common
act
of
mercy
you
shall
not
be
denied
the
joy
of
generosity
says
she
with
a
sweet
grace
but
you
must
suffer
me
to
give
your
ship
company
some
token
of
my
gratitude
then
turning
to
simon
with
an
air
of
authority
she
says
simon
i
have
no
money
the
poor
man
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
bringing
out
a
purse
laid
it
open
showing
some
four
or
five
pieces
of
silver
and
one
of
gold
which
he
hastily
covered
with
his
hand
i
see
you
have
not
enough
says
moll
and
taking
up
a
pen
she
quickly
wrote
some
words
on
a
piece
of
paper
signing
it
judith
godwin
then
showing
it
to
simon
she
says
you
will
pay
this
when
it
is
presented
to
you
and
therewith
she
folds
it
and
places
it
in
the
captain
hand
bidding
him
farewell
in
a
pretty
speech
a
hundred
pounds
a
hundred
pounds
gasps
simon
under
his
breath
in
an
agony
and
clutching
up
his
purse
to
his
breast
i
am
astonished
says
moll
returning
from
the
door
and
addressing
simon
with
a
frown
upon
her
brow
that
you
are
not
better
furnished
to
supply
my
wants
knowing
by
my
letter
how
i
stand
mistress
replies
he
humbly
here
is
all
i
could
raise
upon
such
sudden
notice
laying
his
purse
before
her
what
is
this
cries
she
emptying
the
contents
upon
the
table
is
nothing
here
is
barely
sufficient
to
pay
for
our
accommodation
in
this
inn
where
is
the
money
to
discharge
my
debt
to
these
friends
who
have
lost
all
in
saving
me
you
were
given
timely
notice
of
their
purpose
prithee
be
patient
with
me
gentle
mistress
is
true
i
knew
of
their
intent
but
they
were
to
have
returned
in
six
months
and
when
they
came
not
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
did
truly
give
up
all
for
lost
and
so
i
made
a
fresh
investment
of
thy
fortune
laying
it
out
all
in
life
bonds
and
houses
to
great
worldly
advantage
as
thou
shalt
see
in
good
time
ere
long
i
may
get
in
some
rents
and
in
the
meanwhile
are
we
to
stay
in
this
plight
to
beg
for
charity
asks
moll
indignantly
nay
mistress
doubtless
for
your
present
wants
this
kind
merchant
friend
we
have
lost
all
says
i
evans
his
ship
and
i
the
lading
in
which
all
my
capital
was
embarked
and
i
every
maravedi
i
possessed
adds
the
don
and
had
they
not
cries
moll
were
they
possessed
now
of
all
they
had
think
you
that
i
with
an
estate
as
i
am
told
of
sixty
thousand
pounds
would
add
to
the
debt
i
owe
them
by
one
single
penny
if
i
may
speak
in
your
steward
defence
madam
says
i
humbly
i
would
point
out
that
the
richest
estate
is
not
always
readily
converted
into
money
is
like
a
rich
jewel
which
the
owner
though
he
be
starving
must
hold
till
he
find
a
market
thee
hearest
him
mistress
cries
simon
in
delight
a
man
of
business
a
merchant
who
knows
these
things
explain
it
further
friend
for
thine
are
words
of
precious
wisdom
with
landed
property
the
case
is
even
more
difficult
tenants
can
not
be
forced
to
pay
rent
before
it
is
due
nor
can
their
messuages
be
sold
over
their
heads
and
possibly
all
your
capital
is
invested
in
land
every
farthing
that
could
be
scraped
together
says
simon
and
not
a
rood
of
it
but
is
leased
to
substantial
men
oh
what
excellent
discourse
proceed
further
friend
nevertheless
says
i
there
are
means
of
raising
money
upon
credit
if
he
live
there
still
there
is
a
worthy
jew
in
mary
axe
who
upon
certain
considerations
of
interest
hold
friend
cries
simon
what
art
thee
thinking
of
wouldst
deliver
my
simple
mistress
into
the
hands
of
jew
usurers
not
without
proper
covenants
made
out
by
lawyers
and
attorneys
lawyers
attorneys
and
usurers
heaven
have
mercy
upon
us
verily
thee
wouldst
infest
us
with
a
pest
and
bleed
us
to
death
for
our
cure
i
will
have
such
relief
as
i
may
says
moll
so
pray
sir
do
send
for
these
lawyers
and
jews
at
once
and
the
quicker
since
my
servant
seems
more
disposed
to
hinder
than
to
help
me
forbear
mistress
for
the
love
of
god
forbear
cries
simon
in
an
agony
clasping
his
hands
be
not
misguided
by
this
foolish
merchant
who
hath
all
to
gain
and
nought
to
lose
by
this
proceeding
give
me
but
a
little
space
and
their
claims
shall
be
met
thy
desires
shall
be
satisfied
and
yet
half
of
thy
estate
be
saved
which
else
must
be
all
devoured
betwixt
these
ruthless
and
lawyers
i
can
make
a
covenant
more
binding
than
any
attorney
as
i
have
proved
again
and
again
and
with
a
gulp
if
money
must
be
raised
at
once
i
know
an
honest
a
fairly
honest
goldsmith
in
lombard
street
who
will
lend
at
the
market
rate
these
gentlemen
answers
moll
turning
to
us
may
not
choose
to
wait
and
i
will
not
incommode
them
for
my
own
convenience
something
for
our
present
need
we
must
have
madam
says
the
don
with
a
significant
glance
at
his
outlandish
dress
but
those
wants
supplied
am
content
to
wait
and
you
sir
says
moll
to
me
with
a
hundred
or
two
says
i
taking
don
sanchez
hint
we
may
do
very
well
till
michaelmas
be
reasonable
gentlemen
implores
simon
mopping
his
eyes
which
ran
afresh
at
this
demand
is
but
some
five
or
six
weeks
to
michaelmas
surely
fifty
pounds
silence
cries
moll
with
an
angry
tap
of
her
foot
will
three
hundred
content
you
gentlemen
consider
the
wants
of
our
good
friend
captain
evans
may
be
more
pressing
than
yours
he
is
a
good
honest
simple
man
and
i
think
we
may
answer
for
his
accepting
the
conditions
we
make
for
ourselves
then
with
some
reasonable
guarantee
for
our
future
payment
that
may
be
contrived
to
our
common
satisfaction
i
hope
says
moll
with
a
gracious
smile
i
owe
you
half
my
estate
share
my
house
at
chislehurst
with
me
till
the
rest
is
forthcoming
that
will
give
me
yet
a
little
longer
the
pleasure
of
your
company
and
there
sir
turning
to
me
you
can
examine
my
steward
accounts
for
your
own
satisfaction
and
counsel
me
mayhap
upon
the
conduct
of
my
affairs
knowing
so
much
upon
matters
of
business
that
are
incomprehensible
to
a
simple
inexperienced
maid
then
should
you
find
aught
amiss
in
my
books
anything
to
shake
your
confidence
in
his
management
you
will
in
justice
to
your
friends
in
kindness
to
me
speak
your
mind
openly
that
instant
reformation
may
be
made
don
sanchez
and
i
expressed
our
agreement
to
this
proposal
and
moll
turning
to
the
poor
unhappy
steward
says
in
her
high
tone
of
authority
you
hear
how
this
matter
is
ordered
simon
take
up
that
purse
for
your
own
uses
go
into
the
town
and
send
such
tradesmen
hither
as
may
supply
us
with
proper
clothing
then
to
your
goldsmith
in
lombard
street
and
bring
me
back
six
hundred
pounds
six
hundred
pounds
cries
he
hardly
above
his
breath
and
with
a
pause
between
each
word
as
if
to
gain
strength
to
speak
six
hundred
three
for
these
gentlemen
and
three
for
my
own
needs
when
that
is
done
hasten
to
chislehurst
and
prepare
my
house
and
as
you
value
my
favour
see
that
nothing
is
wanting
when
i
come
there
and
here
lest
it
should
be
thought
that
moll
could
not
possibly
play
her
part
so
admirably
in
this
business
despite
the
many
secret
instructions
given
by
the
longheaded
don
i
do
protest
that
i
have
set
down
no
more
than
i
recollect
and
that
without
exaggeration
further
it
must
be
observed
that
in
our
common
experience
many
things
happen
which
would
seem
incredible
but
for
the
evidence
of
our
senses
and
which
no
poet
would
have
the
hardihood
to
represent
is
true
that
in
this
as
in
other
more
surprising
particulars
to
follow
moll
did
surpass
all
common
women
but
is
only
such
extraordinary
persons
that
furnish
material
for
any
history
and
i
will
add
that
anything
is
possible
to
one
who
hath
the
element
of
greatness
in
her
composition
and
that
it
depends
merely
on
the
accident
of
circumstances
whether
a
moll
dawson
becomes
a
great
saint
or
a
great
sinner
a
blessing
or
a
curse
to
humanity
chapter
xv
our
hands
on
six
hundred
pounds
and
quarter
ourselves
in
hurst
court
but
stand
in
a
fair
way
to
be
undone
by
dawson
his
the
next
day
comes
simon
with
a
bag
of
six
hundred
pounds
which
he
tells
over
with
infinite
care
groaning
and
mopping
his
eyes
betwixt
each
four
or
five
pieces
with
a
most
rueful
visage
so
that
it
seemed
he
was
weeping
over
this
great
expenditure
and
then
he
goes
to
prepare
the
court
and
get
servants
against
moll
arrival
by
the
end
of
the
week
being
furnished
with
suitable
clothing
and
equipment
moll
and
don
sanchez
leave
us
though
dawson
was
now
as
hale
and
hearty
as
ever
he
had
been
we
being
persuaded
to
rest
at
chatham
yet
another
week
to
give
countenance
to
jack
late
distemper
and
also
that
we
might
appear
less
like
a
gang
of
thieves
before
going
don
sanchez
warned
us
that
very
likely
simon
would
pay
us
a
visit
suddenly
to
satisfy
any
doubts
that
might
yet
crop
up
in
his
suspicious
mind
and
so
to
be
prepared
for
him
i
got
in
a
good
store
of
paper
and
books
such
as
a
merchant
might
require
in
seeking
to
reestablish
himself
in
business
and
dawson
held
himself
in
readiness
to
do
his
share
of
this
knavish
business
sure
enough
about
three
days
after
this
the
drawer
who
had
been
instructed
to
admit
no
one
to
my
chamber
without
my
consent
comes
up
to
say
that
the
little
old
man
in
leather
with
the
weak
eyes
would
see
me
so
i
bade
him
in
a
high
voice
bid
simon
step
up
and
setting
myself
before
my
table
of
paper
engage
in
writing
a
letter
already
half
writ
while
dawson
slips
out
into
the
next
room
take
a
seat
mr
steward
says
i
when
simon
entered
cap
in
hand
and
casting
a
very
prying
curious
look
around
i
must
keep
you
a
minute
or
two
and
so
i
feign
to
be
mighty
busy
and
give
him
scope
for
observation
well
sir
says
i
finishing
my
letter
with
a
flourish
and
setting
it
aside
how
do
you
fare
he
raised
his
hands
and
dropped
them
like
so
much
lead
on
his
knees
casting
up
his
eyes
and
giving
a
doleful
shake
of
his
head
for
a
reply
nothing
is
amiss
at
the
court
i
pray
your
lady
mistress
godwin
is
well
i
know
not
friend
says
he
she
hath
taken
my
keys
denied
me
entrance
to
her
house
and
left
me
no
privilege
of
my
office
save
the
use
of
the
lodge
house
thus
am
i
treated
like
a
faithless
servant
after
toiling
night
and
day
all
these
years
and
for
her
advantage
rather
than
mine
own
that
has
to
be
proved
mr
steward
says
i
severely
for
you
must
admit
that
up
to
this
present
she
has
had
no
reason
to
love
you
seeing
that
had
her
fate
been
left
in
your
hands
she
would
now
be
in
barbary
and
like
to
end
her
days
there
how
then
can
she
think
but
that
you
had
some
selfish
wicked
end
in
denying
her
the
service
we
who
are
strangers
have
rendered
her
thee
speakest
truth
friend
and
yet
thee
knowest
that
i
observed
only
the
righteous
prudence
of
an
honest
servant
we
will
say
no
more
on
that
head
but
you
may
rest
assured
on
my
promise
knowing
as
i
do
the
noble
generous
nature
of
your
mistress
that
if
she
has
done
you
wrong
in
suspecting
you
of
base
purpose
she
will
be
the
first
to
admit
her
fault
and
offer
you
reparation
i
seek
no
reparation
no
reward
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
right
to
cherish
this
estate
cries
he
in
passion
and
upon
my
looking
at
him
very
curiously
as
not
understanding
the
motive
of
such
devotion
he
continues
thee
canst
not
believe
me
and
yet
truly
i
am
neither
a
liar
nor
a
madman
what
do
others
toil
for
a
wife
children
friends
the
gratification
of
ambition
or
lust
i
have
no
kith
or
kin
no
ambition
no
lust
but
this
estate
is
wife
child
everything
to
me
is
like
some
work
of
vanity
a
carved
image
that
a
man
may
give
his
whole
life
to
making
and
yet
die
content
if
he
achieves
but
some
approach
to
the
creation
of
his
soul
i
have
made
this
estate
out
of
nothing
it
hath
grown
larger
and
larger
richer
and
more
rich
in
answer
to
my
skill
why
should
i
not
love
it
and
put
my
whole
heart
in
the
accomplishment
of
my
design
with
the
same
devotion
that
you
admire
in
the
maker
of
graven
images
despite
his
natural
infirmities
simon
delivered
this
astonishing
rhapsody
with
a
certain
sort
of
vehemence
that
made
it
eloquent
and
indeed
strange
as
his
passion
was
i
could
not
deny
that
it
was
as
reasonable
in
its
way
as
any
nobler
act
of
i
begin
to
understand
you
mr
steward
says
i
then
good
friend
as
thee
wouldst
help
the
man
in
peril
of
being
torn
from
his
child
render
me
this
estate
to
govern
save
it
from
the
hands
of
usurers
and
lawyers
men
of
no
conscience
to
whom
this
spanish
don
would
deliver
it
for
the
speedy
satisfaction
of
his
greed
nay
my
claim
as
great
as
his
says
i
and
my
affairs
more
pressing
with
a
glance
at
my
papers
i
am
undone
my
credit
lost
my
occupation
gone
thee
shalt
be
paid
to
the
last
farthing
examine
my
books
enquire
into
the
value
of
my
securities
and
thee
wilt

just
claim

safely
settled
upon
mistress
godwin
that

be
done
forthwith
i
understand
the
intricacies
of
the
law
and
know
my
way
tapping
his
head
and
then
his
pocket
to

seal
with

times
the

i
our
poor
captain

still
a
prisoner
in
his
room
aye
says
dawson
coming
in
from
the
next
room
in
his
nightgown
seeming
very
feeble
and
weak
despite
his
blustering
voice
and
i
like
to
be
no
better
till
i
can
get
a
ship
of
my
own
and
be
to
sea
again
have
you
brought

little
while
and
founder
altogether
eh
i
know
you
land
sharks
and
would
i
been
born
with
a
smack
of
your
cunning
then
had
i
never
gone
of
this
venture
and
lost
my
ship
and
twoscore
men
that
replace
look
at
me
a
sheer
hulk
and
no
more
and
all
through
lending
ear
to
one
prayer
and
another
i
doubt
you
minded
to
turn
your
back
on
poor
old
bob
evans
as
have
hopkins
and
why
not
the
poor
old
man
worth
nothing
and
can
not
help
himself
with
this
he
fell
like
any
girl
i
vow
i
not
quit
you
evans
till
you
hale
again
bring
him
with
thee
o
saturday
urged
simon
surely
my
mistress
can
never
have
the
heart
to
refuse
you
shelter
at
the
court
who
owes
her
life
to
ye
come
and
stay
there
till
thy
wage
be
paid
friend
evans
what
would
ye
make
an
honest
sailor
play
and
stick
in
a
house
willy
nilly
till
money
found
plague
of
your
dry
land
give
me
a
pitching
ship
and
a
rolling
sea
and
a
gale
whistling
in
my
shrouds
oh
my
reins
my
reins
give
me
a
paper
of
tobacco
hopkins
and
a
pipe
to
soothe
this
agony
or
i
shall
grow
desperate
i
left
the
room
as
if
to
satisfy
this
desire
and
simon
followed
imploring
me
still
to
come
on
saturday
to
chislehurst
and
i
at
length
got
rid
of
him
by
promising
to
come
as
soon
as
evans
could
be
left
or
induced
to
accompany
me
i
persuaded
dawson
very
much
against
his
gree
to
delay
our
going
until
monday
the
better
to
hoodwink
old
simon
and
on
that
day
we
set
out
for
chislehurst
both
clad
according
to
our
condition
he
in
rough
frieze
and
i
in
a
very
proper
seemly
sort
of
cloth
and
with
more
guineas
in
our
pockets
than
ever
before
we
had
possessed
shillings
and
a
very
merry
journey
this
was
for
dawson
finding
himself
once
more
at
liberty
and
hearty
as
a
lark
after
his
long
confinement
and
under
no
constraint
was
like
a
boy
let
loose
from
school
carolling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
playing
mad
pranks
with
all
who
passed
us
on
the
road
and
staying
at
every
inn
to
drink
twopenny
ale
so
that
i
feared
he
would
certainly
fall
ill
of
drinking
as
he
had
before
of
eating
but
the
exercise
of
riding
the
fresh
wholesome
air
and
half
an
hour
doze
in
a
spinney
did
settle
his
liquor
and
so
he
reached
hurst
court
quite
sober
thanks
be
to
heaven
though
very
gay
and
there
we
had
need
of
all
our
to
conceal
our
joy
in
finding
those
gates
open
to
us
which
we
had
looked
through
so
fondly
when
we
were
last
here
and
to
spy
moll
in
a
stately
gown
on
the
fine
terrace
before
this
noble
house
carrying
herself
as
if
she
had
lived
here
all
her
life
and
don
sanchez
walking
very
deferential
by
her
side
especially
dawson
could
scarce
bring
himself
to
speak
to
her
in
an
uncouth
surly
manner
as
befitted
his
character
and
no
sooner
were
we
entered
the
house
but
he
whips
moll
behind
a
door
and
falls
and
kissing
her
like
any
sly
young
lover
whilst
he
was
giving
way
to
these
extravagances
which
moll
had
not
the
heart
to
rebuff
for
in
her
full
warm
heart
she
was
as
overjoyed
to
see
him
there
as
he
her
don
sanchez
and
i
paced
up
and
down
the
spacious
hall
i
all
of
a
twitter
lest
one
or
other
of
the
servants
might
discover
the
familiarity
of
these
two
which
must
have
been
a
fine
matter
for
curious
gossip
in
the
household
and
elsewhere
and
the
don
mighty
sombre
and
grave
as
foreseeing
an
evil
outcome
of
this
business
so
that
he
would
make
no
answer
to
my
civilities
save
by
dumb
gestures
showing
he
was
highly
displeased
but
truly
was
enough
to
set
us
all
crazy
but
he
with
joy
to
be
in
possession
of
all
these
riches
and
think
that
we
had
landed
at
chatham
scarce
a
fortnight
before
without
decent
clothes
to
our
backs
and
now
but
for
the
success
of
our
design
might
be
the
penniless
strolling
vagabonds
we
were
when
don
sanchez
lighted
on
us
presently
moll
came
out
from
the
side
room
with
her
father
her
hair
all
tumbled
and
as
rosy
as
a
peach
and
she
would
have
us
visit
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
showing
us
the
rooms
set
apart
for
us
her
own
chamber
the
state
room
the
the
store
closets
for
plate
and
linen
all
prodigious
fine
and
in
most
excellent
condition
for
the
scrupulous
minute
care
of
old
simon
had
suffered
nothing
to
fall
out
of
repair
the
rooms
being
kept
well
aired
the
pictures
tapestries
and
magnificent
furniture
all
preserved
fresh
with
linen
covers
and
the
like
from
the
hall
she
led
us
out
on
to
the
terrace
to
survey
the
park
and
the
gardens
about
the
house
and
here
as
within
doors
all
was
in
most
admirable
keeping
with
no
wild
growth
or
runaweeds
anywhere
nor
any
sign
of
neglect
but
i
observed
as
an
indication
of
the
steward
thrifty
unpoetic
mind
that
the
garden
beds
were
planted
with
onions
and
such
marketable
produce
in
place
of
flowers
and
that
instead
of
deer
grazing
upon
the
green
slopes
of
the
park
there
was
only
such
profitable
cattle
as
sheep
cows
etc
and
at
the
sight
of
all
this
abundance
of
good
things
and
especially
the
buttery
dawson
declared
he
could
live
here
all
his
life
and
never
worry
and
with
that
all
unthinkingly
he
lays
his
arm
about
moll
waist
then
the
don
who
had
followed
us
up
and
down
stairs
speaking
never
one
word
till
this
says
we
may
count
ourselves
lucky
captain
evans
if
we
are
suffered
to
stay
here
another
week
chapter
xvi
as
well
as
any
thieves
may
but
dawson
greatly
the
next
morning
i
went
to
simon
at
his
lodge
house
having
writ
him
a
note
overnight
to
prepare
him
for
my
visit
and
there
i
found
him
with
all
his
books
and
papers
ready
for
my
examination
so
to
it
we
set
casting
up
figures
comparing
accounts
and
so
forth
best
part
of
the
day
and
in
the
end
i
came
away
convinced
that
he
was
the
most
scrupulous
honest
steward
ever
man
had
and
truly
it
appeared
that
by
his
prudent
investments
and
careful
management
he
had
trebled
the
value
of
the
estate
and
more
in
the
last
ten
years
he
showed
me
also
that
in
all
his
valuations
he
had
set
off
a
large
sum
for
loss
by
accident
of
fire
war
so
that
actually
at
the
present
moment
the
estate
which
he
reckoned
at
thousand
pounds
was
worth
at
the
least
one
hundred
and
thousand
but
for
better
assurance
on
this
head
i
spent
the
remainder
of
the
week
in
visiting
the
farms
messuages
on
his
rent
roll
and
found
them
all
in
excellent
condition
and
held
by
good
substantial
men
nothing
in
any
particular
but
what
he
represented
it
reporting
on
these
matters
privily
to
don
sanchez
and
dawson
i
asked
the
don
what
we
should
now
be
doing
two
ways
lie
before
us
says
he
lighting
a
cigarro
put
simon
out
of
his
house
and
make
an
enemy
of
him
adds
he
betwixt
two
puffs
of
smoke
seize
his
securities
sell
them
for
what
they
will
fetch
and
get
out
of
the
country
as
quickly
as
possible
if
the
securities
be
worth
one
hundred
and
thousand
pounds
we
may
puff
possibly
puff
get
forty
thousand
for
them
puff
about
a
third
of
their
value
not
more
that
yields
us
ten
thousand
apiece
on
ten
thousand
pounds
a
man
may
live
like
a
prince
in
spain
the
other
way
is
to
make
a
friend
of
simon
by
restoring
him
to
his
office
suffer
him
to
treble
the
worth
of
the
estate
again
in
the
next
ten
years
and
live
like
kings
puff
in
england
pray
which
way
do
you
incline
señor
says
i
being
a
spaniard
answers
he
gravely
i
should
prefer
to
live
like
a
prince
in
spain
that
would
not
i
says
dawson
stoutly
a
year
and
a
half
of
elche
have
cured
me
of
all
fondness
for
foreign
parts
besides
is
a
beggarly
scurvy
thing
to
fly
one
country
as
if
we
had
done
some
unhandsome
dishonest
trick
if
i
faced
an
englishman
i
should
never
dare
look
him
straight
in
the
eyes
again
what
say
you
mr
hopkins
why
evans
says
i
you
know
my
will
without
telling
i
will
not
of
my
own
accord
go
from
your
choice
which
way
you
will
since
we
owe
everything
to
mistress
judith
observes
the
don
and
as
she
is
no
longer
a
child
ought
not
her
wishes
to
be
consulted
no
says
jack
very
decidedly
and
then
lowering
his
voice
he
adds
for
was
she
judith
godwin
ten
times
told
and
as
old
as
my
grandmother
into
the
bargain
she
is
still
my
daughter
and
shall
do
as
i
choose
her
to
do
and
if
as
you
say
we
owe
her
everything
then
i
count
be
a
mean
dirty
return
to
make
her
live
out
of
england
and
feel
she
has
a
sneaking
coward
for
a
father
as
you
please
says
the
don
give
me
ten
thousand
of
the
sum
you
are
to
be
paid
at
michaelmas
and
you
are
welcome
to
all
the
rest
you
mean
that
señor
cries
jack
seizing
the
don
hand
and
raising
his
left
by
the
holy
mother
answers
don
sanchez
in
spanish
done
cries
dawson
bringing
his
hand
down
with
a
smack
on
the
palm
nay
i
always
believed
you
was
the
most
generous
man
living
ten
from
master
hopkins
says
he
turning
to
me
what
does
that
leave
us
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
the
lord
be
praised
for
evermore
cries
jack
upon
this
moll
by
the
advice
of
don
sanchez
sends
for
simon
and
telling
him
she
is
satisfied
with
the
account
i
have
given
of
his
stewardship
offers
him
the
further
control
of
her
affairs
subject
at
all
times
to
her
decision
on
any
question
concerning
her
convenience
and
reserving
to
herself
the
sole
government
of
her
household
the
ordering
of
her
home
lands
etc
and
simon
grasping
eagerly
at
this
proposal
she
then
gives
him
the
promise
of
one
thousand
pounds
for
his
past
services
and
doubles
the
wages
due
to
him
under
his
contract
with
sir
godwin
give
me
what
it
may
please
thee
to
bestow
that
way
cries
he
all
shall
be
laid
out
to
enrich
this
property
i
have
no
other
use
for
money
no
other
worldly
end
in
life
but
that
and
when
he
saw
me
next
he
was
most
slavish
in
his
thanks
for
my
good
offices
vowing
i
should
be
paid
my
claim
by
michaelmas
if
it
were
in
the
power
of
man
to
raise
so
vast
a
sum
in
such
short
space
surely
thinks
i
there
was
never
a
more
strange
original
creature
than
this
yet
it
do
seem
to
me
that
there
is
no
man
but
his
passion
must
appear
a
madness
to
others
i
must
speak
now
of
moll
her
admirable
carriage
and
sober
conduct
in
these
new
circumstances
which
would
have
turned
the
heads
of
most
others
never
once
to
my
knowledge
did
she
lose
her
on
the
most
trying
occasion
and
this
was
due
not
alone
to
her
own
shrewd
wit
and
understanding
but
to
the
subtle
intelligence
of
don
sanchez
who
in
the
character
of
an
old
and
trusty
friend
was
ever
by
her
side
watchful
of
her
interest
and
his
own
ready
at
any
moment
to
drop
in
her
ear
a
quiet
word
of
warning
or
counsel
by
his
advice
she
had
taken
into
her
service
a
most
commendable
proper
old
gentlewoman
one
margery
butterby
who
as
being
the
widow
of
a
country
parson
was
very
orderly
in
all
things
and
particularly
nice
in
the
proprieties
this
notable
good
soul
was
of
a
cheery
chatty
disposition
of
very
pleasing
manners
and
a
genteel
appearance
and
so
though
holding
but
the
part
of
housekeeper
she
served
as
an
agreeable
companion
and
a
respectable
guardian
whose
mere
presence
in
the
house
silenced
any
question
that
might
have
arisen
from
the
fact
of
three
men
living
under
the
same
roof
with
the
young
and
beautiful
mistress
of
hurst
court
moreover
she
served
us
as
a
very
useful
kind
of
mouthpiece
for
all
those
marvellous
stories
of
her
life
in
barbary
of
the
pirates
we
had
encountered
in
redeeming
her
from
the
turk
with
which
moll
would
beguile
away
any
tedious
for
the
mere
amusement
of
creating
butterby
wonder
and
surprise
as
one
will
tell
stories
of
fairies
to
children
this
good
woman
repeated
with
many
additions
of
her
own
concerning
ourselves
which
to
reflect
credit
on
herself
were
all
to
our
advantage
this
was
the
more
fitting
because
the
news
spreading
that
the
lost
heiress
had
returned
to
hurst
court
excited
curiosity
far
and
wide
and
it
was
not
long
before
families
in
the
surrounding
seats
who
had
known
sir
godwin
in
bygone
times
called
to
see
his
daughter
and
here
moll
wit
was
taxed
to
the
utmost
for
those
who
had
known
judith
godwin
as
an
infant
expected
that
she
should
remember
some
incident
stored
in
their
recollection
but
she
was
ever
equal
to
the
occasion
feigning
a
pretty
doubting
innocence
at
first
then
suddenly
asking
this
lady
if
she
had
not
worn
a
cherry
dress
with
a
beautiful
stomacher
at
the
time
or
that
gentleman
if
he
had
not
given
her
a
gold
piece
for
a
token
and
it
generally
happened
these
shrewd
shafts
hit
their
mark
the
lady
though
she
might
have
forgotten
her
gown
remembering
she
had
a
very
becoming
stomacher
the
gentleman
believing
that
he
did
give
her
a
lucky
penny
and
so
forth
from
very
vanity
then
moll
lofty
carriage
and
her
beauty
would
remind
them
of
their
dear
lost
friend
godwin
in
the
heyday
of
her
youth
and
all
agreed
in
admiring
her
beyond
anything
and
though
moll
from
her
lack
of
knowledge
made
many
slips
and
would
now
and
then
say
things
uncustomary
to
women
of
breeding
yet
these
were
easily
attributed
to
her
living
so
long
in
a
barbarous
country
and
were
as
readily
glanced
over
indeed
nothing
could
surpass
moll
artificial
conduct
on
these
occasions
she
would
lard
her
conversation
with
those
scraps
of
italian
she
learnt
from
me
and
sometimes
affecting
to
have
forgot
her
own
tongue
she
would
stumble
at
a
word
and
turning
to
don
sanchez
ask
him
the
english
of
some
moorish
phrase
then
one
day
there
being
quite
a
dozen
visitors
in
her
state
room
she
brings
down
her
moorish
dress
and
those
baubles
given
her
by
friends
at
elche
to
show
the
ladies
much
to
the
general
astonishment
and
wonder
then
being
prayed
to
dress
herself
in
these
clothes
she
with
some
hesitation
of
modesty
consents
and
after
a
short
absence
from
the
room
returns
in
this
costume
looking
lovelier
than
ever
i
had
before
seen
with
the
rings
about
her
shapely
bare
arms
and
on
her
ankles
and
thus
arrayed
she
brings
me
a
guitar
and
to
my
strumming
sings
a
moorish
song
swaying
her
arms
above
her
head
and
turning
gracefully
in
their
fashion
so
that
all
were
in
an
ecstasy
with
this
strange
performance
and
the
talk
spreading
the
number
of
visitors
grew
apace
as
bees
will
flock
to
honey
and
yielding
to
their
urgent
entreaties
she
would
often
repeat
this
piece
of
business
and
always
with
a
most
winning
grace
that
charmed
every
one
but
she
was
most
a
favourite
of
gentlemen
and
elderly
ladies
for
the
younger
ones
she
did
certainly
put
their
noses
out
of
joint
since
none
could
at
all
compare
with
her
in
beauty
nor
in
manner
either
for
she
had
neither
the
awkward
shyness
of
some
nor
the
boldness
of
others
but
contrived
ever
to
steer
neatly
betwixt
the
two
extremes
by
her
natural
and
fearlessness
of
all
her
new
friends
the
most
eager
in
courting
her
were
sir
harry
upton
and
his
lady
living
in
the
crays
and
they
being
about
to
go
to
london
for
the
winter
did
press
moll
very
hard
to
go
with
them
that
she
might
be
presented
to
the
king
and
truth
to
tell
they
would
not
have
had
to
ask
her
twice
had
she
been
governed
only
by
her
own
inclination
for
she
was
mad
to
go
that
audacious
spirit
of
adventure
still
working
very
strong
in
her
and
she
like
a
winning
gamester
must
for
ever
be
playing
for
higher
and
higher
stakes
but
we
who
had
heard
enough
of
his
excellent
but
lawless
majesty
court
to
fear
the
fate
of
any
impulsive
beauteous
young
woman
that
came
within
his
sway
were
quite
against
this
even
don
sanchez
who
was
no
innocent
did
persuade
her
from
it
with
good
strong
argument
showing
that
despite
his
worldliness
he
did
really
love
her
as
much
as
was
in
his
withered
heart
to
love
any
one
as
for
dawson
he
declared
he
would
sooner
see
his
moll
in
her
than
in
the
king
company
adding
that
be
time
enough
for
her
to
think
of
going
to
court
when
she
had
a
husband
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
and
so
she
refused
this
offer
but
with
secret
tears
i
believe
but
says
she
to
her
father
if
not
to
have
my
own
way
till
i
married
i
shall
get
me
a
husband
as
soon
as
i
can
and
it
seemed
that
she
would
not
have
to
look
far
nor
wait
long
for
one
neither
before
a
month
was
passed
at
least
half
a
dozen
young
sparks
were
courting
her
they
being
attracted
not
only
by
her
wit
and
beauty
but
by
the
report
of
her
wealth
it
being
known
to
all
how
simon
had
enriched
the
estate
and
was
this
abundance
of
suitors
which
prevented
moll
from
choosing
any
one
in
particular
else
had
there
been
but
one
i
believe
the
business
would
have
been
settled
very
quickly
for
now
she
was
in
the
very
flush
of
life
and
the
blood
that
flowed
in
her
veins
was
of
no
lukewarm
kind
but
here
that
i
may
keep
all
my
strings
in
harmony
i
must
quit
moll
for
a
space
to
tell
of
her
father
that
first
hint
of
the
don
bringing
him
to
his
senses
somewhat
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
and
the
exuberance
of
his
joy
subsiding
he
quickly
became
more
circumspect
in
his
behaviour
and
fell
into
the
part
he
had
to
play
and
the
hard
trying
sorrowful
part
that
was
neither
he
nor
i
had
foreseen
for
now
was
he
compelled
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
at
any
length
to
live
apart
from
his
daughter
to
refrain
from
embracing
her
when
they
met
in
the
morning
to
speak
to
her
in
a
rough
churlish
sort
when
his
heart
maybe
was
overflowing
with
love
and
to
reconcile
himself
to
a
cool
indifferent
behaviour
on
her
side
when
his
very
soul
was
yearning
for
gentle
tender
warmth
and
these
natural
cravings
of
affection
were
rather
strengthened
than
stilled
by
repression
as
one
hunger
by
starving
to
add
to
this
he
now
saw
his
moll
more
bewitching
than
ever
she
was
before
the
evidence
of
her
wit
and
understanding
stimulating
that
admiration
which
he
dared
not
express
he
beheld
her
loved
and
courted
openly
by
all
whilst
he
who
had
deeper
feeling
for
her
than
any
and
more
right
to
caress
her
must
at
each
moment
stifle
his
desires
and
lay
fetters
on
his
inclinations
which
constraint
like
chains
binding
down
a
stout
thriving
oak
did
eat
and
corrode
into
his
being
so
that
he
did
live
most
of
these
days
in
a
veritable
torment
yet
for
moll
sake
was
he
very
stubborn
in
his
resolution
and
when
he
could
no
longer
endure
to
stand
indifferently
by
while
others
were
enjoying
her
sprightly
conversation
he
would
go
up
to
his
chamber
and
pace
to
and
fro
like
some
parted
from
her
cub
these
sufferings
were
not
unperceived
by
moll
who
also
had
strong
feeling
to
repress
and
therefore
could
comprehend
her
father
torture
and
she
would
often
seize
an
opportunity
nay
run
great
risk
of
discovery
to
hie
her
secretly
to
his
room
there
to
throw
herself
in
his
arms
and
strain
him
to
her
heart
covering
his
great
face
with
tender
kisses
and
whispering
words
of
hope
and
good
cheer
with
the
tears
on
her
cheek
and
one
day
when
jack
seemed
more
than
usual
downhearted
she
offered
him
to
give
up
everything
and
return
to
her
old
ways
if
he
would
but
this
spurring
his
courage
he
declared
he
would
live
in
hell
rather
than
she
should
fall
from
her
high
estate
and
become
a
mere
vagabond
wench
again
adding
that
was
but
the
first
effort
gave
him
so
much
pain
that
with
practice
all
be
as
nothing
that
such
sweet
kisses
as
hers
once
a
week
did
amply
compensate
him
for
his
fast
etc
then
her
tears
being
brushed
away
she
would
quit
him
with
noiseless
step
and
all
precautions
and
maybe
five
minutes
afterwards
whilst
jack
was
sitting
pensive
at
his
window
pondering
her
sweetness
and
love
he
would
hear
her
laughing
lightly
below
as
if
he
were
already
forgotten
chapter
xvii
dawson
for
moll
good
parts
company
with
us
and
goes
away
a
lonely
on
the
eve
of
michaelmas
day
old
simon
returned
from
london
whither
he
had
gone
two
days
before
to
raise
the
money
he
had
promised
and
calling
upon
him
in
the
afternoon
i
found
him
seated
at
his
table
with
a
most
look
in
his
face
and
his
eyes
streaming
more
copiously
than
usual
and
with
most
abject
humility
he
told
me
that
doing
the
utmost
that
lay
in
his
power
he
had
not
been
able
to
persuade
his
goldsmith
to
lend
more
than
ten
thousand
pounds
on
the
title
deeds
nor
had
he
got
that
he
declared
but
that
the
goldsmith
knew
him
for
an
honest
and
trustworthy
man
whom
he
would
credit
beyond
any
other
in
the
world
for
the
seal
not
yet
being
given
to
judith
godwin
succession
there
was
always
peril
of
dispute
and
lawsuits
which
might
make
these
papers
of
no
value
at
all
the
king
ministers
vying
one
with
another
to
please
their
master
by
bringing
money
rightly
or
wrongly
into
the
treasury
and
this
indeed
may
have
been
true
enough
but
says
he
all
will
go
well
if
thee
wilt
have
but
a
little
patience
for
a
while
my
rents
will
come
in
and
i
will
exact
to
the
last
farthing
and
there
is
a
parcel
of
land
i
may
sell
mayhap
for
instant
payment
though
be
at
a
fearsome
loss
mopping
his
eyes
yet
i
will
do
it
rather
than
put
thee
to
greater
incommodity
and
so
ere
the
end
of
the
week
thee
mayst
safely
count
on
having
yet
another
three
thousand
which
together
makes
nigh
upon
half
the
sum
promised
and
this
dear
good
friend
adds
he
slyly
thee
mayst
well
take
on
account
of
thine
own
share
and
none
dispute
thy
right
for
thy
money
hath
done
all
and
from
what
i
see
of
him
smoking
of
pipes
in
the
public
way
and
drinking
with
any
low
fellows
in
alehouses
this
captain
evans
is
but
a
paltry
mean
man
who
may
be
easily
put
off
with
a
pound
or
two
to
squander
in
his
pleasures
and
as
for
the
spanish
grandee
he
do
seem
so
content
to
be
with
our
mistress
that
i
doubt
he
needs
no
pretext
for
quitting
her
added
to
which
being
of
a
haughty
proud
nature
he
should
scorn
to
claim
his
own
to
the
prejudice
of
a
merchant
who
hath
nought
but
his
capital
to
live
upon
and
i
do
implore
thee
good
friend
to
lay
this
matter
before
my
mistress
in
such
a
way
that
she
may
not
be
wroth
with
me
i
told
him
i
would
do
all
he
could
expect
of
me
in
reason
but
bade
him
understand
that
his
chance
of
forgiveness
for
having
broke
his
first
engagement
depended
greatly
upon
his
exactitude
in
keeping
the
second
and
that
he
might
count
on
little
mercy
from
us
if
the
other
three
thousand
were
not
forthcoming
as
he
promised
so
i
took
the
money
and
gave
him
a
quittance
for
it
signing
it
with
my
false
name
james
hopkins
but
reflecting
on
this
when
i
left
him
i
wished
i
had
not
for
i
clearly
perceived
that
by
this
forgery
i
laid
myself
open
to
very
grievous
consequences
moreover
taking
of
this
solid
money
disguise
it
how
i
would
appeared
to
me
nothing
short
of
downright
robbery
be
it
whose
it
might
in
short
being
now
plunged
up
to
my
neck
in
this
business
i
felt
like
a
foolish
lad
who
hath
waded
beyond
his
depth
in
a
rapid
current
hoping
i
might
somehow
get
out
of
it
safely
but
with
very
little
expectation
however
the
sight
of
all
this
gold
told
up
in
scores
upon
the
table
in
our
closed
room
served
to
quiet
these
qualms
considerably
nevertheless
i
was
not
displeased
to
remember
our
bargain
with
don
sanchez
feeling
that
i
should
breathe
more
freely
when
he
had
taken
this
store
of
gold
out
of
my
hands
etc
thus
did
my
mind
waver
this
way
and
that
like
a
to
the
blowing
of
contrary
winds
was
this
day
that
moll
as
i
have
said
dressed
herself
in
her
moorish
clothes
for
the
entertainment
of
her
new
friends
and
dawson
hearing
her
voice
yet
not
daring
to
go
into
the
state
room
where
she
was
must
needs
linger
on
the
stairs
listening
to
her
song
and
craning
his
neck
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
through
the
open
door
below
here
he
stands
in
a
sort
of
ravishment
sucking
in
her
sweet
voice
and
the
sounds
of
delight
with
which
her
guests
paid
tribute
to
her
performance
feeding
his
passion
which
like
some
fire
grew
more
fierce
by
feeding
till
he
was
beside
himself
presently
out
comes
moll
from
her
state
room
all
glowing
with
exercise
flushed
with
pleasure
a
rich
colour
in
her
cheek
and
wild
fire
in
her
eyes
looking
more
witching
than
any
siren
swiftly
she
crosses
the
hall
and
runs
up
the
stairs
to
gain
her
chamber
and
reclothe
herself
but
half
way
up
dawson
stops
her
and
clasping
her
about
cries
hoarsely
in
a
transport
thou
art
my
own
moll
my
own
sweet
moll
adding
as
she
would
break
from
him
to
go
her
way
nay
chick
you
shall
not
go
till
you
have
bussed
your
old
dad
then
she
hesitating
a
moment
betwixt
prudence
and
her
warmer
feelings
suddenly
yields
to
the
impulse
of
her
heart
her
head
also
being
turned
maybe
with
success
and
delight
and
flinging
her
arms
about
his
neck
gives
him
a
hearty
kiss
and
then
bursts
away
with
a
light
laugh
jack
watches
her
out
of
sight
and
then
when
the
moment
of
escape
is
past
he
looks
below
to
see
if
there
be
any
danger
and
there
he
spies
don
sanchez
regarding
him
from
the
open
door
where
he
stands
as
if
to
guard
it
without
a
sign
the
don
turns
on
his
heel
and
goes
back
into
the
room
while
dawson
with
a
miserable
hangdog
look
comes
to
me
in
my
chamber
where
i
am
counting
the
gold
and
confesses
his
folly
with
a
shamed
face
cursing
himself
freely
for
his
indiscretion
which
at
this
rate
must
ruin
all
ere
long
this
was
no
great
surprise
to
me
for
i
myself
had
seen
him
many
a
time
clip
his
dear
daughter
hand
when
he
thought
no
one
was
by
and
more
than
once
the
name
of
moll
had
slipped
out
when
he
should
have
spoken
of
mistress
judith
these
accidents
threw
us
both
into
a
very
grave
humour
and
especially
i
was
tormented
with
the
reflection
that
a
forgery
could
be
proved
against
me
if
things
came
to
the
worst
the
danger
thereof
was
not
slight
for
though
all
in
the
house
loved
moll
dearly
and
would
willingly
do
her
no
hurt
yet
the
servants
should
they
notice
how
mistress
judith
stood
with
captain
evans
must
needs
be
prating
and
there
a
mischief
would
begin
to
end
only
the
lord
knows
where
thereupon
i
thought
it
as
well
to
preach
jack
a
sermon
and
caution
him
to
greater
prudence
and
this
he
took
in
amazing
good
part
not
bidding
me
tend
my
own
business
as
he
might
at
another
time
but
assenting
very
submissively
to
all
my
hints
of
disaster
and
thanking
me
in
the
end
for
speaking
my
mind
so
freely
then
seeing
him
so
sadly
downcast
i
to
give
a
sweetmeat
after
a
bitter
draught
bade
him
take
the
matter
not
too
much
to
heart
promising
that
with
a
little
practice
he
would
soon
acquire
a
habit
of
and
so
all
would
go
well
but
he
made
no
response
save
by
shaking
of
his
head
sorrowfully
and
would
not
be
comforted
when
all
were
abed
that
night
we
three
men
met
in
my
chamber
where
i
had
set
the
bags
of
money
on
the
table
together
with
a
dish
of
tobacco
and
a
bottle
of
wine
for
our
refreshment
and
then
the
don
having
lit
him
a
cigarro
and
we
our
pipes
with
full
glasses
beside
us
i
proposed
we
should
talk
of
our
affairs
to
which
don
sanchez
consented
with
a
solemn
inclination
of
his
head
but
ere
i
began
i
observed
with
a
pang
of
foreboding
that
jack
who
usually
had
emptied
his
glass
ere
others
had
sipped
theirs
did
now
leave
his
untouched
and
after
the
first
pull
or
two
at
his
pipe
he
cast
it
on
the
hearth
as
though
it
were
foul
to
his
taste
taking
no
open
notice
of
this
i
showed
don
sanchez
the
gold
and
related
all
that
had
passed
between
simon
and
me
happily
señor
says
i
in
conclusion
here
is
just
the
sum
you
generously
offered
to
accept
for
your
share
and
we
give
it
you
with
a
free
heart
evans
and
i
being
willing
to
wait
for
what
may
be
forthcoming
is
it
your
wish
both
that
i
take
this
says
he
laying
his
hand
on
the
money
and
looking
from
me
to
dawson
aye
says
he
is
but
a
tithe
of
what
is
left
to
us
and
not
an
hundredth
part
of
what
we
owe
to
you
very
good
says
the
don
i
will
carry
it
to
london
but
surely
señor
says
i
you
will
not
quit
us
so
soon
don
sanchez
rolls
his
cigarro
in
his
lips
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
and
somewhat
sternly
and
asks
me
quietly
if
i
have
ever
found
him
lacking
in
loyalty
and
friendship
in
truth
never
señor
then
why
should
you
imagine
i
mean
to
quit
you
now
when
you
have
more
need
of
a
friend
in
this
house
with
a
sideward
glance
as
towards
moll
chamber
than
ever
you
before
had
then
turning
towards
jack
he
says
what
are
you
going
to
do
captain
evans
dawson
pauses
as
if
to
snatch
one
last
moment
for
consideration
and
then
nodding
at
me
you
not
leave
my
moll
kit
says
he
with
no
attempt
to
disguise
names
why
should
i
leave
her
are
we
not
as
brothers
you
and
i
aye
i
trust
you
with
my
life
answers
he
and
more
than
that
with
my
moll
if
you
were
her
uncle
she
could
love
you
more
kit
and
you
will
stand
by
her
too
señor
the
don
bowed
his
head
then
when
you
leave
i
go
with
you
to
london
says
jack
i
shall
return
the
next
day
says
don
sanchez
with
significance
and
i
shall
not
god
help
me
says
jack
bitterly
give
me
your
hand
says
the
don
but
i
could
speak
never
a
word
and
sat
staring
at
jack
in
a
maze
we
say
nought
of
this
to
her
continues
jack
there
must
be
no
farewells
i
could
never
endure
that
but
it
shall
seem
that
i
have
gone
with
you
for
company
and
have
fallen
in
with
old
comrades
who
would
keep
me
for
a
carousing
but
without
friends
alone
what
shall
you
do
there
in
london
says
i
at
the
thought
of
his
desolation
the
don
answers
for
jack
make
the
best
of
his
lot
with
a
stout
heart
like
any
other
brave
man
says
he
there
are
natural
hardships
which
every
man
must
bear
in
his
time
and
this
is
one
of
them
then
lowering
his
voice
he
adds
unless
you
would
have
her
die
an
old
maid
she
and
her
father
must
part
sooner
or
later
why
that
true
and
yet
master
says
jack
i
would
have
you
know
that
i
not
so
brave
but
i
would
see
her
now
and
then
that
may
be
ordered
readily
enough
says
the
don
then
do
you
tell
her
señor
i
have
but
gone
and
she
may
look
to
see
me
again
when
my
frolic
over
the
don
closed
his
eyes
as
one
in
dubitation
and
then
says
lifting
his
eyebrows
she
is
a
clever
woman
shrewd
beyond
any
i
have
ever
known
then
why
treat
her
as
you
would
a
foolish
child
you
must
let
me
tell
her
the
truth
when
i
come
back
and
i
warrant
it
will
not
break
her
heart
much
as
she
loves
you
as
you
will
says
be
all
as
one
to
me
with
a
sigh
this
falls
out
well
in
all
ways
continues
the
don
turning
to
me
you
will
tell
simon
whose
suspicion
we
have
most
to
fear
that
we
have
handed
over
four
thousand
of
those
pieces
to
captain
evans
as
being
most
in
need
we
ourselves
choosing
to
stay
here
till
the
rest
of
our
claim
is
paid
that
will
account
for
evans
going
away
and
give
us
a
pretext
for
staying
here
i
visit
him
myself
if
you
will
says
jack
and
wring
his
hand
to
show
my
gratitude
i
warrant
i
make
him
wince
such
a
grip
will
i
give
him
and
i
talk
of
nothing
else
but
seas
and
winds
and
the
manner
of
ship
i
have
for
his
money
the
following
morning
before
moll
was
stirring
don
sanchez
and
dawson
set
forth
on
their
journey
and
i
going
with
them
beyond
the
park
gates
to
the
bend
of
the
road
we
took
leave
of
each
other
with
a
great
show
of
cheerfulness
on
both
sides
but
lord
my
heart
lay
in
my
breast
like
any
lump
of
lead
and
when
jack
turned
his
back
on
me
the
tears
sprang
up
in
my
eyes
as
though
indeed
this
was
my
brother
and
i
was
never
to
see
him
more
and
long
after
he
was
out
of
sight
i
sat
on
the
bank
by
the
roadside
sick
with
pain
to
think
of
his
sorrow
in
going
forth
like
this
without
one
last
loving
word
of
parting
from
his
dear
moll
to
find
no
home
in
london
no
friend
to
cheer
him
and
he
the
most
companionable
man
in
the
world
chapter
xviii
our
getting
a
painter
into
the
court
with
whom
our
moll
falls
straightway
in
being
somewhat
of
a
coward
i
essayed
to
put
moll
off
with
a
story
of
her
father
having
gone
with
don
sanchez
leaving
it
to
the
don
to
break
the
truth
to
her
on
his
return
and
a
sorry
bungling
business
i
made
of
it
to
be
sure
for
looking
me
straight
in
the
eyes
whenever
i
dared
lift
them
she
did
seem
to
perceive
that
i
was
lying
from
the
very
first
which
so
disconcerted
me
though
she
interrupted
me
by
never
a
word
that
i
could
scarce
stammer
to
the
end
of
my
tale
then
without
asking
a
single
question
or
once
breaking
her
painful
silence
she
laid
her
face
in
her
hands
her
shoulders
shook
and
the
tears
ran
out
between
her
fingers
and
fell
upon
her
lap
i
know
i
know
says
she
putting
me
away
when
i
attempted
to
speak
he
has
gone
away
for
my
sake
and
will
come
back
no
more
and
is
all
my
fault
that
i
could
not
play
my
part
better
then
what
words
of
comfort
i
could
find
i
offered
her
but
she
would
not
be
consoled
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
all
that
morning
nevertheless
she
ate
more
heartily
than
i
at
dinner
and
fresh
visitors
coming
in
the
afternoon
she
entertained
them
as
though
no
grief
lay
at
her
heart
indeed
she
recovered
of
this
cruel
blow
much
easier
than
i
looked
for
and
but
that
she
would
at
times
sit
pensive
with
melancholy
wistful
eyes
and
rise
from
her
seat
with
a
troubled
sigh
one
would
have
said
at
the
end
of
the
week
that
she
had
ceased
to
feel
for
her
father
but
this
was
not
so
albeit
wounds
heal
quickly
in
the
young
and
healthful
for
i
believe
that
they
who
weep
the
least
do
ache
the
most
then
for
her
further
excuse
if
it
be
needed
don
sanchez
brought
back
good
tidings
of
her
father
how
he
was
neatly
lodged
near
the
cherry
garden
where
he
could
hear
the
birds
all
day
and
the
fiddles
all
night
with
abundance
of
good
entertainment
etc
to
confirm
which
she
got
a
letter
from
him
three
days
later
very
loving
and
cheerful
telling
how
his
landlord
being
a
carpenter
he
did
amuse
himself
mightily
at
his
old
trade
in
the
workshop
and
was
all
agog
for
learning
to
turn
wood
in
a
lathe
promising
that
he
would
make
her
a
set
of
against
her
birthday
please
god
added
to
this
the
number
of
her
friends
multiplying
apace
every
day
brought
some
new
occupation
to
her
thoughts
also
having
now
those
three
thousand
pounds
old
simon
had
promised
us
moll
set
herself
to
spending
of
them
as
quickly
as
possible
by
furnishing
herself
with
all
sorts
of
rich
gowns
and
appointments
which
is
as
pretty
a
diversion
of
melancholy
from
a
young
woman
thoughts
as
any
and
so
i
think
i
need
dwell
no
longer
on
this
head
about
the
beginning
of
october
simon
comes
cap
in
hand
and
very
humble
to
the
court
to
crave
moll
consent
to
his
setting
some
men
with
guns
in
her
park
at
night
to
lie
in
ambush
for
poachers
telling
how
they
had
shot
one
man
in
the
act
last
spring
and
had
hanged
another
the
year
before
for
stealing
of
a
sheep
adding
that
a
stranger
had
been
seen
loitering
in
the
neighbourhood
who
he
doubted
not
was
of
their
thieving
crew
what
makes
you
think
that
asks
moll
he
has
been
seen
lingering
about
here
these
three
days
answers
simon
yet
to
my
knowledge
he
hath
not
slept
at
either
of
the
village
inns
moreover
he
hath
the
look
of
a
desperate
starving
rascal
ripe
for
such
work
i
will
have
no
man
killed
for
his
misfortunes
gentle
mistress
suffer
me
to
point
out
that
if
thee
lets
one
man
steal
with
impunity
others
now
innocent
are
thereby
encouraged
to
sin
and
thus
thy
mercy
tends
to
greater
cruelty
no
man
shall
be
killed
on
my
land
there
is
my
answer
says
moll
with
passion
if
you
take
this
poor
starved
creature
it
shall
be
without
doing
him
bodily
hurt
you
shall
answer
for
it
else
not
a
bone
shall
be
broken
mistress
is
enough
if
we
carry
him
before
justice
martin
a
godly
upright
man
and
a
scourge
to
nay
you
shall
not
do
that
neither
till
i
have
heard
his
case
says
moll
is
for
me
to
decide
whether
he
has
injured
me
or
not
and
suffer
none
to
take
my
place
promising
obedience
simon
withdrew
before
any
further
restrictions
might
be
put
upon
him
but
moll
mind
was
much
disturbed
all
day
by
fear
of
mischief
being
done
despite
her
commands
and
at
night
she
would
have
me
take
her
round
the
park
to
see
all
well
maybe
she
thought
that
her
own
father
stealing
hither
to
see
her
privily
might
fall
a
victim
to
simon
ambushed
hirelings
but
we
found
no
one
though
simon
had
certainly
hidden
these
fellows
somewhere
in
the
thickets
whilst
we
were
at
table
next
morning
we
heard
a
great
commotion
in
the
hall
and
butterby
coming
in
a
mighty
pucker
told
how
the
robber
had
been
taken
in
the
park
and
how
simon
had
brought
him
to
the
house
in
obedience
to
her
lady
command
but
do
pray
have
a
care
of
yourself
my
dear
lady
says
she
for
this
hardy
villain
hath
struck
simon
in
the
face
and
made
most
desperate
resistance
and
heaven
protect
us
from
such
wicked
outlaws
as
have
the
villany
to
show
themselves
in
broad
daylight
moll
smiling
said
she
would
rather
face
a
lion
in
the
day
than
a
mouse
by
night
and
so
bade
the
captive
to
be
brought
before
her
then
in
comes
simon
with
a
stout
band
over
one
eye
followed
by
two
sturdy
fellows
holding
their
prisoner
betwixt
them
and
this
was
a
very
passionate
man
as
was
evidenced
by
the
looks
of
fury
he
cast
from
side
to
side
upon
his
captors
as
they
dragged
him
this
way
and
that
to
make
a
show
of
their
power
but
not
in
his
struggles
he
had
lost
his
hat
and
his
threadbare
coat
and
shirt
were
torn
open
laying
bare
his
neck
and
showing
a
very
fair
white
skin
and
a
good
beard
of
light
curling
hair
there
was
nought
mean
or
vile
in
his
face
but
rather
it
seemed
to
me
a
noble
countenance
though
woefully
wasted
so
that
at
a
glance
one
might
perceive
he
was
no
born
rascal
but
likely
enough
some
ruined
man
of
better
sort
driven
to
unlawful
ways
by
his
distress
he
was
of
a
fair
height
but
gaunt
beyond
everything
and
so
feeble
that
after
one
effort
to
free
his
arms
his
chin
sank
upon
his
breast
as
if
his
forces
were
all
spent
seeing
this
moll
bade
the
fellows
unbind
him
telling
them
sharply
they
might
see
there
was
no
need
of
such
rigour
being
freed
our
prisoner
lifts
his
head
and
makes
a
slight
reverence
to
moll
but
with
little
gratitude
in
his
look
and
places
himself
at
the
end
of
the
table
facing
us
who
are
at
the
other
end
moll
sitting
betwixt
don
sanchez
and
me
and
there
setting
his
hands
for
support
upon
the
board
he
holds
his
head
up
pretty
proudly
waiting
for
what
might
come
who
are
you
asks
moll
in
a
tone
of
authority
he
waits
a
moment
as
if
deliberating
with
himself
whether
to
speak
fairly
or
not
then
being
still
sore
with
his
and
angered
to
be
questioned
thus
by
a
mere
girl
he
as
i
take
it
being
a
man
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
he
answers
i
do
not
choose
to
tell
who
i
am
what
i
am
concerns
you
no
more
than
who
and
what
you
are
concerns
me
and
less
since
i
may
justly
demand
by
what
right
these
fellows
whom
i
take
to
be
your
servants
have
thus
laid
hands
on
me
how
do
you
answer
this
asks
moll
turning
to
simon
then
simon
told
very
precisely
as
if
he
were
before
a
magistrate
how
this
man
having
been
seen
lingering
about
the
court
several
days
and
being
without
home
or
occupation
had
been
suspected
of
felonious
purposes
how
therefore
he
had
set
a
watch
to
lay
wait
for
him
how
that
morning
they
had
entrapped
him
standing
within
a
covert
of
the
park
regarding
the
house
how
he
had
refused
to
give
his
name
or
any
excuse
for
his
being
there
and
how
he
had
made
most
desperate
attempt
to
escape
when
they
had
lain
hands
on
him
is
this
true
asks
moll
of
the
prisoner
yes
says
he
moll
regards
him
with
incredulous
eyes
a
moment
then
turning
to
simon
what
arms
had
he
for
this
purpose
that
you
speak
of
says
she
none
mistress
but
be
a
dread
villain
verily
who
would
carry
the
engines
of
his
trade
abroad
in
daylight
to
betray
him
and
then
he
told
how
is
the
habit
of
these
poachers
to
reconnoitre
their
ground
by
day
and
keep
their
nets
guns
concealed
in
some
thicket
or
hollow
tree
convenient
for
their
purpose
but
adds
he
we
may
clearly
prove
a
trespass
against
him
which
is
a
punishable
offence
and
this
assault
upon
me
whereof
i
have
evidence
shall
also
count
for
something
with
justice
martin
and
so
the
wicked
shall
yet
come
by
their
deserts
and
with
that
he
gives
his
fellows
a
wink
with
his
one
eye
to
carry
off
their
quarry
stay
says
moll
i
would
be
further
convinced
if
he
be
an
honest
man
let
him
show
thee
his
hand
says
simon
the
man
innocently
enough
stretches
out
his
palm
towards
us
not
perceiving
simon
end
there
cries
simon
what
said
i
is
that
a
hand
that
ever
did
a
honest
work
is
no
worse
than
mine
says
moll
regarding
the
hand
which
in
truth
was
exceeding
smooth
and
well
formed
come
adds
she
still
more
kindly
you
see
i
am
no
harsh
judge
i
would
not
deny
a
the
pleasure
that
is
not
grudged
the
coney
that
runs
across
my
lawn
tell
me
you
were
there
but
to
gratify
a
passing
caprice
and
forgive
you
as
freely
as
i
believe
you
this
gentle
appeal
seemed
to
move
the
young
man
greatly
and
he
made
as
if
he
would
do
more
than
was
demanded
of
him
and
make
that
free
confession
which
he
had
refused
to
force
but
ere
a
word
could
leave
his
parted
lips
a
deadly
shade
passed
over
his
face
his
knees
gave
under
him
and
staggering
to
save
himself
he
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
swoon
then
whilst
all
we
men
stood
fixed
in
wonderment
moll
with
the
quick
helpful
impulse
of
her
womanhood
ran
swiftly
from
her
place
to
his
side
and
dropping
on
her
knees
cried
for
water
to
be
brought
her
dead
of
hunger
says
don
sanchez
in
my
ear
fetch
a
flask
of
brandy
and
then
laying
hold
of
simon
by
the
shoulder
he
pointed
significantly
to
the
open
door
this
hint
simon
was
not
slow
to
take
and
when
i
returned
from
the
buttery
with
a
case
of
strong
waters
i
found
no
one
in
the
room
but
don
sanchez
and
moll
with
the
fainting
man
head
upon
her
lap
bathing
his
temples
gently
life
had
not
come
back
and
the
young
man
face
looked
very
handsome
in
death
the
curls
pushed
back
from
his
brow
and
his
long
features
still
and
colourless
like
a
carved
marble
then
with
a
and
alas
in
bustles
butterby
with
a
bottle
of
cordial
in
one
hand
and
a
bunch
of
burning
feathers
in
the
other
fling
that
rubbish
in
the
chimney
says
the
don
i
know
this
malady
well
enough
and
pouring
some
hollands
in
a
cup
he
put
it
to
the
dead
man
parted
lips
in
a
few
moments
he
breathed
again
and
hearing
moll
cry
of
joy
he
opened
his
eyes
as
one
waking
from
a
dream
and
turned
his
head
to
learn
what
had
happened
then
finding
his
head
in
moll
lap
and
her
small
soft
cool
hand
upon
his
brow
a
smile
played
over
his
wasted
face
and
well
indeed
might
he
smile
to
see
that
young
figure
of
justice
turned
to
the
living
image
of
tender
mercy
perceiving
him
out
of
danger
and
recovering
her
own
wits
at
the
same
time
butterby
cries
lord
madam
do
let
me
call
a
maid
to
take
your
place
for
dear
heart
you
have
quite
spoiled
your
new
gown
with
this
mess
of
water
and
all
for
such
a
paltry
fellow
as
this
truly
it
must
have
seemed
to
her
understanding
an
outrageous
thing
that
a
lady
of
her
mistress
degree
should
be
nursing
such
a
ragged
rascal
but
to
me
knowing
moll
helpful
impulsive
disposition
was
no
such
extraordinary
matter
for
she
at
such
a
moment
could
not
entertain
those
feelings
which
might
have
restrained
a
lady
of
more
refined
breeding
the
pretty
speech
of
butterby
reaching
the
fallen
man
ear
seemed
instantly
to
quicken
his
spirits
and
casting
off
his
lethargic
humour
he
quickly
staggered
to
his
feet
while
we
raised
moll
then
resting
one
hand
upon
the
table
for
support
he
craved
her
pardon
for
giving
so
much
trouble
but
in
a
very
faint
weak
voice
i
would
have
done
as
much
for
a
dog
says
moll
my
friends
will
render
you
what
further
services
are
fit
and
if
it
appears
that
you
have
been
unjustly
used
as
i
do
think
you
have
be
sure
you
shall
have
reparation
i
ask
no
more
says
he
than
to
be
treated
as
i
may
merit
in
your
esteem
justice
shall
be
done
says
don
sanchez
in
his
stern
voice
and
with
that
he
conducts
moll
to
the
door
but
moll
was
not
content
with
this
promise
of
justice
for
the
quality
of
mercy
begetteth
love
so
that
one
can
not
moderate
one
anger
against
an
enemy
but
it
doth
breed
greater
compassion
and
leniency
by
making
one
better
content
with
oneself
and
therefore
more
indulgent
to
others
and
so
when
she
had
left
the
room
she
sends
in
her
maid
to
fetch
me
and
taking
me
aside
says
with
vivacity
i
will
have
no
punishment
made
upon
that
man
nay
says
i
but
if
is
proved
that
his
intent
was
to
rob
you
what
then
says
she
hath
he
not
as
much
right
to
this
estate
as
we
and
are
we
one
whit
the
better
than
he
save
in
the
more
fortunate
issue
of
our
designs
understand
me
adds
she
with
passion
i
will
have
nothing
added
to
his
unhappiness
i
found
the
young
man
seated
at
the
table
and
don
sanchez
gravely
setting
food
before
him
but
he
would
take
nothing
but
bread
and
that
he
ate
as
though
it
were
the
sweetest
meat
in
all
the
world
i
lead
the
don
to
the
window
and
there
in
an
undertone
told
him
of
decision
and
whether
her
tone
of
supreme
authority
amused
him
or
not
i
can
not
say
because
of
his
impassive
humour
but
he
answered
me
with
a
serious
inclination
of
his
head
and
then
we
fell
speaking
of
other
matters
in
our
usual
tone
until
the
young
man
having
satisfied
the
cravings
of
nature
spoke
when
you
are
at
liberty
gentlemen
says
he
to
question
my
conduct
i
will
answer
you
chapter
xix
the
business
appointed
to
the
painter
and
how
he
set
about
the
the
young
man
had
risen
and
was
standing
by
the
table
when
we
turned
from
the
window
he
seemed
greatly
refreshed
his
face
had
lost
its
livid
hue
of
passion
and
death
and
looked
the
better
for
a
tinge
of
colour
he
met
our
regard
boldly
yet
with
no
braggart
insolent
air
but
the
composure
of
a
brave
man
facing
his
trial
with
a
consciousness
of
right
upon
his
side
i
would
ask
you
says
the
don
seating
himself
on
side
the
table
why
you
refused
to
do
that
before
sir
answers
he
i
have
lost
everything
in
the
world
save
some
small
modicum
of
pride
which
being
all
i
have
i
do
cherish
maybe
unduly
and
so
when
these
unmannerly
hinds
took
me
by
the
throat
calling
on
me
to
tell
my
name
and
business
this
spirit
within
me
flaring
up
i
could
not
answer
with
the
humility
of
a
villain
seeking
to
slink
out
of
danger
by
submissive
excuses
be
seated
says
the
don
accepting
this
explanation
with
a
bow
how
may
we
call
you
in
venice
replies
the
other
with
some
hesitation
i
was
called
dario
a
name
given
me
by
my
because
my
english
name
was
not
to
their
taste
enough
says
the
don
i
can
understand
a
man
of
better
fortune
as
i
perceive
you
have
been
wishing
in
such
a
position
as
this
to
retain
his
incognito
there
are
no
parks
in
venice
to
my
knowledge
but
surely
sir
you
would
not
enter
a
palazzo
there
uninvited
without
some
reasonable
pretext
it
would
be
sufficient
that
in
such
a
house
as
this
i
thought
i
might
find
some
employment
for
a
painter
you
are
a
painter
says
i
a
poor
one
as
you
see
replies
dario
with
a
significant
glance
at
his
clothes
don
sanchez
turned
to
me
hunching
his
shoulders
is
clear
says
he
that
signor
dario
has
been
grossly
abused
by
our
lady
steward
you
have
but
to
tell
us
sir
what
reparation
we
can
make
you
i
not
refuse
it
answers
dario
eagerly
you
shall
grant
me
permission
to
prove
the
honesty
of
my
story
and
something
more
than
that
somewhere
here
adds
he
glancing
around
him
i
leave
a
tribute
to
the
grace
of
that
dear
lady
who
brought
me
back
to
life
don
sanchez
assents
with
a
bow
to
this
proposal
but
with
a
rueful
glance
at
the
rich
panels
of
the
wall
as
fearing
this
painter
might
be
as
poor
in
talent
as
in
his
clothes
the
latter
reflecting
discredit
on
the
former
and
would
disfigure
the
handsome
walls
with
some
rude
daub
ah
cries
dario
casting
his
eye
upon
the
ceiling
which
was
plastered
in
the
italian
mode
and
embellished
with
a
poor
design
of
cherubs
and
clouds
this
ceiling
is
ill
done
i
could
paint
a
fresco
that
would
less
disgrace
the
room
you
will
need
materials
says
the
don
laying
his
purse
upon
the
table
when
you
return
with
them
you
may
rely
upon
having
our
consent
to
your
wishes
the
painter
took
the
purse
with
a
bow
of
acknowledgment
and
no
more
hesitation
than
one
gentleman
would
show
in
receiving
an
obligation
from
another
and
presently
left
us
shall
we
see
him
again
think
ye
señor
i
asked
when
we
were
left
to
ourselves
he
nodded
but
with
such
a
reflective
sombre
air
that
i
was
impelled
to
ask
him
if
he
lacked
confidence
in
the
story
told
us
by
the
painter
his
story
may
be
true
enough
but
whether
signor
dario
be
an
honest
man
or
not
is
another
matter
a
painter
but
a
man
a
ruined
gentleman
will
accommodate
his
principles
to
circumstances
with
a
side
glance
that
seemed
to
say
i
am
a
ruined
gentleman
and
my
mind
would
be
easier
if
i
knew
by
what
curious
accident
a
painter
in
need
should
find
himself
in
the
heart
of
kent
and
why
fixing
on
this
house
to
seek
employment
he
should
linger
to
the
point
of
starvation
before
he
can
pluck
up
courage
to
ask
a
simple
question
we
must
keep
our
eyes
open
hopkins
and
adds
he
dropping
his
voice
our
mouths
shut
i
could
not
sleep
that
night
for
thinking
of
and
bloody
struggles
for
dear
life
for
is
a
matter
of
common
report
that
this
sort
of
robbers
ere
they
make
attack
do
contrive
to
get
one
of
their
number
into
the
house
that
he
may
learn
where
good
goods
are
stowed
which
part
is
easiest
of
attack
etc
i
know
not
whether
these
quakings
were
shared
by
the
don
but
certainly
our
misgivings
never
entered
moll
little
head
nay
rather
her
romantic
disposition
did
lead
her
when
she
heard
our
narration
to
conceive
that
this
mysterious
dario
might
be
some
wandering
genius
whose
work
upon
our
ceiling
would
make
the
court
for
ever
glorious
and
while
in
this
humour
she
bade
me
go
to
simon
whose
presence
she
would
not
tolerate
in
her
house
and
make
him
acquainted
with
her
high
displeasure
and
furthermore
to
command
that
he
should
make
satisfactory
apology
to
dario
upon
his
return
so
to
him
i
went
and
he
wringing
his
hands
in
anguish
deplored
that
his
best
endeavours
to
serve
his
mistress
served
only
to
incense
her
the
more
against
him
but
for
his
apology
he
declared
that
has
been
made
the
moment
he
heard
of
the
gentleman
release
at
the
same
time
that
he
restored
to
him
his
hat
and
a
which
had
fallen
from
his
pocket
this
did
somewhat
reassure
me
knowing
full
well
that
simon
would
not
have
given
up
this
book
without
first
acquainting
himself
with
its
contents
and
urging
that
had
there
been
anything
in
it
to
incriminate
him
he
had
certainly
laid
it
before
his
mistress
for
his
own
justification
a
couple
of
days
after
this
as
don
sanchez
and
i
were
discoursing
in
the
great
avenue
dario
presents
himself
looking
all
the
better
for
a
decent
suit
of
clothes
and
a
more
prosperous
condition
and
moll
joining
us
at
that
moment
he
makes
her
a
very
handsome
obeisance
and
standing
uncovered
before
her
begs
to
know
if
it
is
her
will
that
he
should
paint
the
ceiling
of
her
as
he
spoke
the
colour
rose
on
his
cheek
and
a
shaft
of
sunlight
falling
on
his
curling
hair
which
shone
with
the
lustre
of
health
made
him
look
as
comely
a
man
as
ever
i
did
see
and
a
good
five
years
younger
than
when
he
stood
before
us
in
the
extremity
of
distress
sir
says
moll
were
you
my
debtor
as
much
as
i
am
yours
i
could
not
ask
for
better
payment
don
sanchez
put
an
end
to
this
pretty
exchange
of
courtesies
which
maybe
he
considered
overmuch
as
between
a
lady
of
moll
degree
and
one
who
might
turn
out
to
be
no
more
than
an
indifferent
painter
at
the
best
by
proposing
that
dario
should
point
out
what
disposition
he
would
have
made
for
his
convenience
in
working
so
he
went
within
doors
and
there
dario
gave
orders
to
our
gardener
who
was
a
handy
sort
of
what
pieces
of
furniture
should
be
removed
how
the
walls
and
floor
should
be
protected
and
how
a
scaffold
should
be
set
up
for
him
to
work
on
and
the
gardener
promising
to
carry
out
all
these
instructions
in
the
course
of
the
day
dario
took
his
leave
of
us
in
a
very
polished
style
saying
he
would
begin
his
business
the
next
morning
betimes
sure
enough
we
were
awoke
next
day
by
a
scraping
below
and
coming
down
we
found
our
painter
in
a
and
a
smock
that
covered
him
to
his
heels
upon
his
scaffold
preparing
the
ceiling
in
a
very
workmanlike
manner
and
to
see
him
then
with
his
face
and
beard
thickly
crusted
over
with
a
mess
of
dry
plaster
and
paint
did
i
think
somewhat
dispel
those
fanciful
illusions
which
our
moll
had
fostered
she
doubtless
expecting
to
find
him
in
a
very
graceful
attitude
and
beautiful
to
look
at
creating
a
picture
as
if
by
inchantment
her
mortification
was
increased
later
in
the
day
when
we
having
invited
him
on
her
insistence
to
dine
at
our
table
he
declined
civilly
enough
saying
he
had
brought
his
repast
with
him
and
we
presently
found
him
seated
astride
one
of
his
planks
with
a
pocket
knife
in
one
hand
and
a
of
bread
and
bacon
in
the
other
which
he
seemed
to
be
eating
with
all
the
relish
in
the
world
why
he
is
nought
but
a
common
labourer
says
moll
disgusted
to
see
him
regaling
himself
in
this
fashion
as
we
returned
to
our
room
a
pretty
picture
we
are
like
to
get
for
all
this
mess
and
inconvenience
and
her
idol
being
broken
as
it
were
and
all
her
fond
fancies
dashed
she
would
not
as
much
as
look
at
him
again
nor
go
anigh
the
room
to
be
reminded
of
her
folly
however
on
the
third
day
dario
sent
to
ask
if
she
would
survey
his
outlines
and
decide
whether
the
design
pleased
her
or
not
for
this
purpose
he
had
pushed
aside
his
scaffold
and
here
we
saw
a
perspective
done
on
the
ceiling
in
charcoal
representing
a
vaulted
roof
with
an
opening
to
the
sky
in
the
middle
surrounded
by
a
little
balcony
with
trailing
plants
running
over
it
and
flowers
peeping
out
betwixt
the
balusters
and
this
though
very
rough
was
most
artificial
making
the
room
look
twice
its
height
and
the
most
admirable
masterly
drawing
that
i
did
ever
see
and
now
moll
who
had
prepared
a
courteous
speech
to
cover
the
contempt
she
expected
to
feel
for
the
work
could
say
nought
for
astonishment
but
stood
casting
her
eyes
round
at
the
work
like
one
in
a
maze
if
you
would
prefer
an
allegory
of
figures
says
dario
misconceiving
her
silence
nay
answers
she
i
would
have
nothing
altered
is
wonderful
how
such
effect
can
be
made
with
mere
lines
of
black
i
can
scarce
believe
the
ceiling
is
flat
and
then
she
drops
her
eyes
upon
dario
regarding
him
with
wonder
as
if
doubting
that
such
a
man
could
have
worked
this
miracle
you
must
have
seen
better
designs
in
rome
says
he
at
this
i
took
alarm
not
thinking
for
the
moment
that
he
might
have
picked
up
some
particulars
of
judith
godwin
history
from
butterby
or
the
curious
servants
who
were
ever
prying
in
the
room
is
so
long
ago
says
moll
readily
i
think
i
have
seen
something
like
it
in
the
holy
city
observes
the
don
critically
probably
nothing
has
been
left
undone
in
rome
i
am
told
it
has
not
been
my
good
fortune
to
get
so
far
this
was
good
news
for
otherwise
he
might
have
put
some
posers
to
moll
which
she
had
found
it
hard
to
answer
without
betraying
her
ignorance
having
moll
approval
dario
set
to
work
forthwith
to
colour
his
perspective
and
this
he
did
with
the
sure
firm
hand
of
one
who
understands
his
business
and
with
such
nice
judgment
that
no
builder
whose
design
is
ordered
by
fixed
rule
and
line
could
accomplish
his
work
with
greater
truth
and
justice
he
made
it
to
appear
that
the
lower
part
of
his
vaulted
roof
was
wainscoted
in
the
style
of
the
walls
and
to
such
perfection
that
have
puzzled
a
conjurer
to
decide
where
the
oaken
panels
ended
and
the
painted
ones
began
and
now
moll
suffers
her
fancies
to
run
wild
again
and
could
not
sufficiently
marvel
over
this
poor
painter
and
his
work
of
which
she
would
discourse
to
such
lengths
that
both
the
don
and
i
at
times
had
some
ado
to
stifle
our
yawns
she
would
have
it
that
he
was
no
common
man
but
some
great
genius
compelled
by
misfortune
or
the
persecution
of
rivals
to
wander
abroad
in
disguise
taking
for
evidence
the
very
facts
which
had
lately
led
her
to
condemn
him
pointing
out
that
whereas
those
young
gentlemen
who
courted
her
so
persistently
did
endeavour
on
all
occasions
to
make
their
estate
and
natural
parts
appear
greater
than
they
were
this
dario
did
not
proving
that
he
had
no
such
need
of
fictitious
advancement
and
could
well
afford
to
let
the
world
judge
of
his
worth
by
his
works
etc
this
point
we
did
not
contest
only
we
were
very
well
content
to
observe
that
he
introduced
no
one
into
the
house
had
no
friends
in
the
village
to
our
knowledge
and
that
nought
was
lacking
from
our
store
of
plate
she
never
tired
of
watching
him
at
his
work
having
the
hardihood
to
mount
upon
the
scaffold
where
he
stood
and
there
she
would
sit
by
the
hour
on
a
little
stool
chatting
like
any
magpie
when
the
nature
of
his
occupation
allowed
his
thoughts
to
wander
silent
as
a
mouse
when
she
perceived
that
his
mind
was
absorbed
in
travail
ready
at
any
moment
to
fetch
this
or
hold
and
seizing
every
opportunity
to
serve
him
indeed
i
believe
she
would
gladly
have
helped
him
shift
the
heavy
planks
when
he
would
have
their
position
altered
had
he
permitted
her
this
rough
usage
of
her
delicate
hands
one
day
when
he
was
about
to
begin
the
foliage
upon
his
balcony
he
brought
in
a
spray
of
ivy
for
a
model
then
moll
told
him
she
knew
where
much
better
was
to
be
found
and
would
have
him
go
with
her
to
see
it
and
she
coming
back
from
this
expedition
with
her
arms
full
of
briony
and
herbage
richly
tinted
by
the
first
frost
i
perceived
that
there
was
a
new
kind
of
beauty
in
her
face
a
radiance
of
great
happiness
and
satisfaction
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
here
was
herbage
enough
for
a
week
but
she
must
have
fresh
the
next
morning
and
thenceforth
every
day
they
would
go
out
ere
the
sun
was
high
hunting
for
new
models
to
prepare
for
these
early
excursions
mistress
moll
though
commonly
disposed
to
lie
abed
late
in
the
morning
must
have
been
up
by
daybreak
and
despite
her
admiration
of
dario
simplicity
in
dress
she
showed
no
inclination
to
follow
his
example
in
this
particular
but
on
the
contrary
took
more
pains
in
adorning
her
person
at
this
time
than
ever
she
had
done
before
and
as
she
would
dress
her
hair
no
two
mornings
alike
so
she
would
change
the
fashion
of
her
dress
with
the
same
inconstancy
until
the
sly
hussy
discovered
which
did
most
please
taste
then
a
word
of
approval
from
him
nay
a
glance
would
suffice
to
fix
her
choice
until
she
found
that
his
admiration
needed
rekindling
and
so
as
if
her
own
imagination
was
not
sufficiently
forcible
she
would
talk
of
nothing
with
her
friends
but
the
newest
fashions
at
court
with
the
result
that
her
maids
were
for
ever
some
new
wash
for
her
face
which
she
considered
too
brown
compounding
charms
to
remove
a
little
mole
she
had
in
the
nape
of
her
neck
cutting
up
one
gown
to
make
another
and
so
forth
one
day
she
presented
herself
with
a
black
patch
at
the
corner
of
her
lip
and
having
seen
nought
of
this
fashion
before
i
cried
out
in
alarm
lord
child
have
you
injured
your
face
with
that
mess
betty
was
stewing
yesterday
what
an
absurd
creature
you
are
answers
she
testily
do
you
know
that
is
the
mode
now
for
ladies
to
wear
spots
signor
dario
adds
she
her
eyes
lighting
up
finds
it
mighty
becoming
when
i
saw
her
thus
disfiguring
her
pretty
face
as
i
considered
it
then
though
i
came
to
admire
this
embellishment
later
on
to
please
signor
dario
i
began
to
ask
myself
how
this
business
was
likely
to
end
chapter
xx
moll
ill
humour
and
what
befel
feeling
in
the
absence
of
dawson
that
i
stood
in
the
position
of
a
guardian
to
his
daughter
and
was
responsible
for
her
welfare
my
mind
grew
very
uneasy
about
the
consequences
of
her
extravagant
admiration
for
the
painter
and
knowing
that
don
sanchez
despite
his
phlegmatic
humour
loved
moll
very
sincerely
at
heart
i
took
him
aside
one
day
and
asked
him
if
he
had
observed
nothing
particular
in
moll
behaviour
of
late
one
would
be
blind
says
he
not
to
see
that
she
is
enamoured
of
dario
if
that
what
you
mean
i
admitted
that
my
suspicions
inclined
that
way
and
explaining
my
concern
on
her
behalf
i
asked
him
what
he
would
do
in
my
place
in
my
country
says
he
matters
never
would
have
been
suffered
to
go
so
far
and
mistress
judith
would
have
been
shut
up
a
prisoner
in
her
room
these
past
three
weeks
but
i
doubt
if
our
maidens
are
any
the
safer
or
better
for
such
treatment
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
such
treatment
would
be
worse
than
useless
for
an
english
girl
and
especially
such
an
one
as
this
for
guard
her
how
you
might
she
would
assuredly
find
means
to
break
her
prison
and
then
no
course
is
open
to
her
but
to
throw
herself
in
the
arms
of
the
man
she
loves
trusting
to
mere
accident
whether
he
abuses
her
devotion
or
not
you
might
as
well
strive
to
catch
the
wind
and
hold
it
as
stay
and
stem
the
course
of
youthful
passion
aye
señor
says
i
this
may
be
all
very
true
but
what
should
you
do
in
my
place
nothing
says
he
this
was
a
piece
of
advice
which
set
me
scratching
my
head
in
dubitation
beware
continues
he
how
you
suggest
the
thing
you
fear
to
one
who
needs
but
a
hint
to
act
i
have
great
faith
in
the
natural
modesty
of
women
and
i
do
think
no
child
more
innocent
than
mistress
judith
which
though
it
blind
them
to
their
danger
does
at
the
same
time
safeguard
them
against
secret
and
illicit
courses
of
more
fatal
consequences
let
her
discourse
with
him
openly
since
it
pleases
her
in
another
fortnight
or
so
dario
work
will
be
finished
he
will
go
away
our
young
lady
will
shed
secret
tears
and
be
downcast
for
a
week
then
another
swain
will
please
her
and
she
smile
again
that
as
i
take
it
will
be
the
natural
order
of
events
unless
adds
he
that
natural
order
is
disturbed
by
some
external
influence
maugre
this
sage
advice
my
concern
being
unabated
i
would
step
pretty
frequently
into
the
room
where
these
young
people
were
as
if
to
see
how
the
work
was
going
forward
and
with
such
a
quick
step
that
had
any
interchange
of
amorous
sentiments
existed
i
must
at
one
time
or
another
have
discovered
it
but
i
never
detected
any
sign
of
this
no
bashful
silence
no
sudden
confusion
or
covert
interchange
of
glances
sometimes
they
would
be
chatting
lightly
at
others
both
would
be
standing
silent
she
maybe
holding
a
bunch
of
leaves
with
untiring
steadfastness
for
him
to
copy
but
i
observed
that
she
was
exceedingly
jealous
of
his
society
and
no
matter
how
glibly
she
was
talking
when
i
entered
or
how
indifferent
the
subject
she
would
quickly
become
silent
showing
me
very
plainly
by
her
manner
that
she
would
vastly
prefer
my
room
to
my
company
still
i
was
not
displeased
when
i
perceived
this
fresco
drawing
near
to
its
completion
you
are
getting
on
apace
says
i
very
cheerfully
one
day
i
reckon
you
will
soon
have
done
yes
answers
he
in
a
week
i
shall
have
nought
to
do
but
to
pack
up
my
tools
and
go
there
was
an
accent
of
sorrow
in
his
voice
despite
himself
which
did
not
escape
me
nor
moll
neither
for
i
saw
her
cast
her
eyes
upon
his
face
as
if
to
read
if
there
were
sadness
there
but
she
said
never
a
word
however
in
the
afternoon
she
comes
to
me
and
says
she
i
am
resolved
i
will
have
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
plastered
if
signor
dario
will
consent
to
paint
them
all
the
rooms
says
i
in
alarm
surely
you
have
not
counted
the
cost
of
what
you
propose
i
suppose
i
have
enough
to
keep
my
house
in
suitable
condition
without
doubt
though
i
expect
such
work
as
signor
dario
must
command
a
high
price
all
i
ask
of
you
then
says
she
is
to
bid
my
steward
have
five
thousand
pounds
ready
for
my
uses
and
within
a
week
lest
i
should
need
it
suddenly
should
he
raise
objections
as
assuredly
he
will
says
i
who
knew
the
crafty
subtle
character
of
old
simon
full
well
by
this
time
a
thousand
objections
and
not
one
you
can
pick
a
hole
in
then
show
him
this
and
tell
him
i
accept
goodman
offer
unless
he
can
find
more
profitable
means
of
raising
money
with
that
she
puts
in
my
hand
a
letter
she
had
that
morning
received
from
one
henry
goodman
a
tenant
who
having
heard
that
she
had
disposed
of
a
farm
to
his
neighbour
now
humbly
prayed
she
would
do
him
the
same
good
turn
by
selling
him
the
land
he
rented
and
for
which
he
was
prepared
to
pay
down
in
ready
money
the
sum
of
five
thousand
pounds
armed
with
this
letter
i
sought
simon
and
delivered
moll
message
as
i
expected
the
wily
old
man
had
good
excuses
ready
for
not
complying
with
this
request
showing
me
the
pains
he
had
taken
to
get
the
seal
his
failures
to
move
the
king
officers
and
the
refusal
of
his
goldsmith
to
furnish
further
supplies
before
the
deed
of
succession
was
passed
these
objections
are
all
very
just
says
i
so
i
see
no
way
of
pleasing
our
lady
but
by
selling
goodman
farm
which
she
will
have
done
at
once
if
there
be
no
alternative
so
i
give
him
the
letter
which
he
can
scarce
read
for
trembling
with
anguish
what
cries
he
coming
to
the
end
i
am
to
sell
this
land
which
i
bought
for
nine
hundred
pounds
and
is
now
worth
six
thousand
i
would
rather
my
mistress
had
bid
me
have
the
last
teeth
torn
from
my
head
we
must
have
money
says
i
thee
shalt
have
it
in
good
time
evans
hath
been
paid
and
thy
debt
shall
be
discharged
fear
not
i
spoke
as
representing
our
lady
for
ourselves
we
are
content
to
wait
her
better
convenience
and
i
told
him
how
his
mistress
would
lay
out
her
money
in
embellishing
the
court
with
paintings
which
put
him
to
a
new
taking
to
think
so
much
good
money
should
be
wasted
in
such
vanities
but
says
he
this
work
must
take
time
and
one
pays
for
nothing
ere
done
by
quarter
day
our
rents
will
be
coming
in
again
no
says
i
cutting
him
short
the
money
must
be
found
at
once
or
be
assured
that
your
lady
will
take
the
management
of
her
affairs
out
of
your
hands
this
raised
a
fresh
outcry
and
more
lamentations
but
in
the
end
he
promised
to
procure
the
money
by
collecting
his
rents
in
advance
if
his
mistress
would
refuse
goodman
offer
and
wait
three
weeks
and
on
moll
behalf
i
agreed
to
these
terms
a
few
days
after
this
we
were
called
into
the
to
see
the
finished
ceiling
which
truly
deserved
all
the
praise
we
could
bestow
upon
it
and
more
for
now
that
the
sky
appeared
through
the
opening
with
a
little
pearly
cloud
creeping
across
it
the
verdure
and
flowers
falling
over
the
marble
coping
and
the
sunlight
falling
on
one
side
and
throwing
into
shade
the
illusion
was
complete
so
that
one
could
scarcely
have
been
more
astonished
had
a
leaf
fallen
from
the
hanging
flowers
or
a
face
looked
over
the
balcony
in
short
was
prodigious
nevertheless
the
painter
looking
up
at
his
work
with
critical
eyes
seemed
dissatisfied
and
asking
us
if
we
found
nothing
lacking
we
not
to
appear
behindhand
in
judgment
agreed
that
on
one
side
there
was
a
vacant
place
which
might
yet
be
adorned
to
advantage
yes
says
he
i
see
what
is
wanted
and
will
supply
it
that
adds
he
gently
turning
to
moll
will
give
me
still
another
day
why
what
charm
can
you
add
that
is
not
there
asks
she
something
says
he
in
a
low
voice
which
i
must
see
whenever
i
do
cast
my
eyes
heavenwards
and
now
moll
big
with
her
purpose
which
she
had
hitherto
withheld
from
dario
begs
him
to
come
into
her
state
room
and
there
she
told
how
she
would
have
this
ceiling
plastered
over
and
painted
like
her
if
he
would
undertake
to
do
it
dario
casts
his
eye
round
the
room
and
over
the
ceiling
and
then
shaking
his
head
says
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
alter
nothing
here
but
i
will
have
it
altered
says
she
nettled
because
he
did
not
leap
at
once
at
her
offer
which
was
made
rather
to
prolong
their
communion
than
to
obtain
a
picture
i
detest
these
beams
of
wood
they
are
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
room
i
think
adds
he
looking
round
him
again
with
renewed
admiration
i
think
i
have
never
seen
a
more
perfect
example
of
english
art
what
of
that
cries
she
if
it
pleases
me
to
have
it
otherwise
nothing
returns
he
calmly
you
have
as
just
a
right
to
stand
by
your
opinion
as
i
by
mine
and
am
i
to
understand
that
you
will
rather
hold
by
your
opinion
than
give
me
pleasure
i
pray
you
do
not
press
me
to
discourtesy
says
he
nay
but
i
would
have
a
plain
answer
to
my
question
says
she
haughtily
then
says
he
angering
in
his
turn
i
must
tell
you
that
i
would
as
soon
chip
an
antique
statue
to
suit
the
taste
of
a
french
modiste
as
disfigure
the
work
of
him
who
designed
this
room
now
whether
moll
took
this
to
be
a
reflection
on
her
own
figure
which
had
grown
marvellous
slim
in
the
waist
since
she
had
her
new
stays
from
london
or
not
i
will
not
say
but
certainly
this
response
did
exasperate
her
beyond
all
endurance
as
we
could
see
by
her
blanched
cheek
and
flashing
eye
so
dismissing
him
with
a
deep
curtsey
she
turns
on
her
heel
without
another
word
this
foolish
business
which
was
not
very
creditable
to
our
moll
good
sense
though
i
think
she
acted
no
worse
than
other
maids
in
her
condition
for
i
have
observed
that
young
people
do
usually
lose
their
heads
at
the
same
time
that
they
lose
their
hearts
this
foolish
scene
i
say
i
would
gladly
omit
from
my
history
but
that
it
completely
changed
our
destiny
for
had
these
two
parted
with
fair
words
we
should
probably
have
seen
no
more
of
dario
and
don
sanchez
prognostic
had
been
realised
such
trifles
as
these
do
influence
our
career
as
greatly
as
more
serious
accidents
our
lives
being
a
fabric
of
events
that
hang
together
by
the
slenderest
threads
unmoved
from
his
design
by
moll
displeasure
dario
replaced
his
scaffold
before
he
left
that
day
and
the
next
morning
he
came
to
put
the
last
touch
upon
his
work
moll
being
still
in
dudgeon
would
not
go
near
him
but
sat
brooding
in
a
corner
of
her
state
room
ready
as
i
perceived
to
fly
out
in
passion
at
any
one
who
gave
her
the
occasion
perceiving
this
don
sanchez
prudently
went
forth
for
a
walk
after
dinner
but
i
seeing
that
some
one
must
settle
accounts
with
the
painter
for
his
work
stayed
at
home
and
when
i
observed
that
he
was
collecting
his
materials
to
go
i
went
in
to
moll
my
dear
says
i
i
believe
dario
is
preparing
to
leave
us
my
congratulations
to
him
says
she
for
is
evident
he
is
weary
of
being
here
nay
wo
you
come
in
and
see
his
work
now
is
finished
no
i
have
no
desire
to
see
it
if
i
have
lost
my
taste
for
italian
art
is
through
no
fault
of
his
you
will
see
him
surely
before
he
goes
no
i
will
not
give
him
another
opportunity
to
presume
upon
my
kindness
why
to
be
sure
says
i
like
a
fool
you
have
been
a
little
indeed
says
she
firing
up
like
a
cracker
then
i
think
have
been
kinder
of
you
to
give
me
a
hint
of
it
beforehand
however
is
a
very
good
excuse
for
treating
him
otherwise
now
well
he
must
be
paid
for
his
work
at
any
rate
assuredly
if
you
have
not
money
enough
i
will
fetch
it
from
my
closet
i
have
it
ready
and
here
is
a
purse
for
the
purpose
the
question
is
how
much
to
put
in
it
i
should
think
such
a
perspective
as
that
could
not
be
handsomely
paid
under
fifty
guineas
then
you
will
give
him
a
hundred
and
say
that
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
him
i
put
this
sum
in
the
purse
and
went
out
into
the
hall
where
dario
was
waiting
with
his
basket
of
brushes
beside
him
in
a
poor
bungling
stammering
fashion
i
delivered
moll
message
and
made
the
best
excuse
i
could
for
delivering
it
in
her
stead
he
waited
a
moment
or
two
after
i
had
spoken
and
then
says
he
in
a
low
voice
is
that
all
nay
says
i
offering
the
purse
we
do
beg
you
to
take
this
as
he
stopped
me
pushing
my
hand
aside
i
have
taken
a
purse
from
don
sanchez
says
he
there
was
more
in
it
than
i
needed
there
are
still
some
pieces
left
but
as
i
would
not
affront
him
by
offering
to
return
them
so
i
beg
you
will
equally
respect
my
feelings
i
undertook
the
task
in
gratitude
and
it
hath
been
a
work
of
love
all
through
well
paid
for
by
the
happiness
that
i
have
found
here
he
stood
musing
a
little
while
as
if
he
were
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
seek
to
overcome
moll
resentment
or
not
then
raising
his
head
quickly
he
says
is
best
so
maybe
farewell
sir
giving
me
his
hand
tell
her
adds
he
as
we
stand
hand
in
hand
at
the
door
that
i
can
never
forget
her
kindness
and
will
ever
pray
for
her
happiness
i
found
the
door
ajar
and
moll
pacing
the
room
very
white
when
i
returned
she
checked
me
the
moment
i
essayed
to
deliver
message
you
can
save
your
breath
says
she
passionately
i
heard
every
word
more
shame
for
you
says
i
in
a
passion
casting
my
purse
on
the
table
is
infamous
to
treat
an
honest
gentleman
thus
and
silly
besides
come
dear
altering
my
tone
do
let
me
run
and
fetch
him
back
you
forget
whom
you
are
speaking
to
hopkins
cries
she
i
saw
was
impossible
to
move
her
whilst
she
was
in
this
mood
for
she
had
something
of
her
father
obstinate
stubborn
disposition
and
did
yet
hope
to
bring
dario
back
to
her
feet
like
a
spaniel
by
harsh
treatment
but
he
came
no
more
though
a
palette
he
had
overlooked
could
have
given
him
the
excuse
and
for
very
vexation
with
moll
i
was
glad
he
did
not
he
had
not
removed
the
scaffold
but
when
i
went
upon
it
to
see
what
else
he
had
put
into
his
painting
the
fading
light
only
allowed
me
to
make
out
a
figure
that
seemed
to
be
leaning
over
the
balcony
moll
would
not
go
in
there
though
i
warrant
she
was
dying
of
curiosity
and
soon
after
supper
which
she
could
scarce
force
herself
to
touch
she
went
up
to
her
own
chamber
wishing
us
a
very
distant
formal
and
keeping
her
passionate
angry
countenance
but
the
next
morning
ere
i
was
dressed
she
knocked
at
my
door
and
opening
it
i
found
her
with
swollen
eyes
and
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
come
down
says
she
betwixt
her
sobs
and
catching
my
hand
in
hers
come
down
and
see
so
we
went
downstairs
together
i
wondering
what
now
had
happened
and
so
into
the
and
there
i
found
the
scaffold
pushed
aside
and
the
ceiling
open
to
view
then
looking
up
i
perceived
that
the
figure
bending
over
the
balcony
bore
moll
own
face
with
a
most
sweet
compassionate
expression
in
it
as
she
looked
down
such
as
i
had
observed
when
she
bent
over
dario
having
brought
him
back
to
life
and
this
thinks
i
remembering
his
words
this
is
what
he
must
ever
see
when
he
looks
heavenwards
chapter
xxi
the
strange
things
told
us
by
the
wise
tell
me
i
am
wicked
tell
me
i
a
fool
says
moll
clinging
to
my
arm
but
i
had
no
feeling
now
but
pity
and
forgiveness
and
so
could
only
try
to
comfort
her
saying
we
would
make
amends
to
dario
when
we
saw
him
next
i
will
go
to
him
says
she
for
nought
in
the
world
would
i
have
him
yield
to
such
a
heartless
fool
as
i
am
i
know
where
he
lodges
well
when
we
have
eaten
nay
we
must
go
this
moment
i
can
not
be
at
peace
till
i
have
asked
him
to
forgive
come
with
me
or
i
must
go
alone
yielding
to
her
desire
without
further
ado
i
fetched
my
hat
and
cloak
and
she
doing
likewise
we
sallied
out
forthwith
taking
the
side
path
by
which
dario
came
and
went
habitually
we
reached
a
little
wicket
gate
opening
from
the
path
upon
the
highway
and
here
seeing
a
man
mending
the
road
we
asked
him
where
we
should
find
anne
fitch
as
she
was
called
with
whom
the
painter
lodged
pointing
to
a
neat
cottage
that
stood
by
the
wayside
within
a
stone
throw
he
told
us
the
wise
woman
lived
there
we
crossed
over
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
voice
within
bidding
us
come
in
we
did
so
there
was
a
very
sweet
pleasant
smell
in
the
room
from
the
herbs
that
hung
in
little
parcels
from
the
beams
for
this
anne
fitch
was
greatly
skilled
in
the
use
of
simples
and
had
no
equal
for
curing
fevers
and
the
like
in
all
the
country
round
but
besides
this
it
was
said
she
could
look
into
the
future
and
forecast
events
truer
than
any
egyptian
there
was
a
chair
by
the
table
on
which
was
an
empty
bowl
and
some
broken
bread
but
the
wise
woman
sat
in
the
chimney
corner
bending
over
the
hearth
though
the
fire
had
burnt
out
and
not
an
ember
glowed
and
a
strange
little
elf
she
looked
being
very
wizen
and
small
with
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
and
a
face
full
of
pain
when
i
told
her
our
business
for
moll
was
too
greatly
moved
to
speak
the
old
woman
pointed
to
the
adjoining
room
he
is
gone
cries
moll
going
to
the
open
door
and
peering
within
yes
answers
anne
fitch
alas
when
did
he
go
asks
moll
an
hour
since
answers
the
other
whither
is
he
gone
i
am
no
witch
at
least
you
know
which
way
he
went
i
have
not
stirred
from
here
since
i
gave
him
his
last
meal
moll
sank
into
the
empty
chair
and
bowed
her
head
in
silence
anne
fitch
whose
keen
eyes
had
never
strayed
from
moll
since
she
first
entered
the
room
seeming
as
if
they
would
penetrate
to
the
most
secret
recesses
of
her
heart
with
that
shrewd
perception
which
is
common
to
many
whose
bodily
infirmity
compels
an
extraordinary
employment
of
their
other
faculties
rises
from
her
settle
in
the
chimney
and
coming
to
the
table
beside
moll
says
i
am
no
witch
i
say
yet
i
could
tell
you
things
would
make
you
think
i
am
i
want
to
know
nothing
further
answers
she
dolefully
save
where
he
is
would
you
not
know
whether
you
shall
ever
see
him
again
or
not
oh
if
you
can
tell
me
that
cries
moll
quickly
i
may
then
turning
to
me
the
wise
woman
asks
to
look
at
my
hand
and
on
my
demurring
she
says
she
must
know
whether
i
am
a
friend
or
an
enemy
ere
she
speaks
before
me
so
on
that
i
give
my
hand
and
she
examines
it
you
call
yourself
james
hopkins
says
she
why
every
one
within
a
mile
knows
that
says
i
aye
answers
she
fixing
her
piercing
eye
on
my
face
but
every
one
knows
not
that
some
call
you
kit
this
fairly
staggered
me
for
a
moment
how
do
you
answer
that
she
asks
observing
my
confusion
why
says
i
recovering
my
presence
of
mind
is
most
extraordinary
to
be
sure
that
you
should
read
this
for
save
one
or
two
familiars
none
know
that
my
second
name
is
christopher
a
fairly
honest
hand
says
she
looking
at
my
hand
again
weak
in
some
things
but
a
faithful
friend
you
may
be
trusted
and
so
she
drops
my
hand
and
takes
up
moll
is
strange
says
she
you
call
yourself
judith
yet
here
i
see
your
name
writ
moll
illustration
you
call
yourself
judith
yet
here
i
see
your
name
writ
moll
poor
moll
sick
with
a
night
of
sorrow
and
terrified
by
the
wise
divining
powers
could
make
no
answer
but
soon
fitch
taking
less
heed
of
her
tremble
than
of
mine
regards
her
hand
again
how
were
you
called
in
barbary
asks
she
this
question
betraying
a
flaw
in
the
wise
woman
perception
gave
moll
courage
and
she
answered
readily
enough
that
she
was
called
lala
mollah
which
was
true
lala
being
the
moorish
for
lady
and
mollah
the
name
her
friends
in
elche
had
called
her
as
being
more
agreeable
to
their
ear
than
the
shorter
english
name
mollah
moll
says
anne
fitch
as
if
communing
with
herself
that
may
well
be
then
following
a
line
in
moll
hand
she
adds
you
will
love
but
once
child
what
is
my
sweetheart
name
whispers
moll
the
colour
springing
in
her
face
you
have
not
heard
it
yet
replies
the
other
upon
which
moll
pulls
her
hand
away
impatiently
but
you
have
seen
him
continues
the
wise
woman
and
his
is
the
third
hand
in
which
i
have
read
another
name
tell
me
now
if
i
shall
see
him
again
cries
moll
eagerly
offering
her
hand
again
and
as
quickly
as
she
had
before
withdrawn
it
that
depends
upon
yourself
returns
the
other
the
line
is
a
deep
one
would
you
give
him
all
you
have
moll
bends
her
head
low
in
silence
to
conceal
her
hot
face
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
says
the
old
woman
in
a
strangely
gentle
tone
is
better
to
love
once
than
often
better
to
give
your
whole
heart
than
part
were
i
young
and
handsome
and
rich
i
would
give
body
and
soul
for
such
a
man
for
he
is
good
and
generous
and
exceeding
kind
look
you
he
hath
lived
here
but
a
few
weeks
and
i
feel
for
him
grieve
for
him
like
a
mother
oh
i
am
no
witch
adds
she
wiping
a
tear
from
her
cheek
only
a
crooked
old
woman
with
the
gift
of
seeing
what
is
open
to
all
who
will
read
and
a
heart
that
quickens
still
at
a
kind
word
or
a
gentle
thought
moll
hand
had
closed
upon
hers
at
that
first
sight
of
her
grief
for
your
names
continues
she
recovering
her
composure
i
learnt
from
one
of
your
maids
who
came
hither
for
news
of
her
sweetheart
that
the
sea
captain
who
was
with
you
did
sometimes
let
them
slip
i
was
paid
to
learn
this
not
by
him
says
moll
no
by
your
steward
simon
paid
for
that
says
i
incredulous
knowing
simon
reluctance
to
spend
money
aye
and
a
good
price
too
it
seems
you
call
heavily
upon
him
for
money
and
do
threaten
to
cut
up
your
estate
and
sell
the
land
he
prizes
as
his
life
that
is
quite
true
says
i
moreover
he
greatly
fears
that
he
will
be
cast
from
his
office
when
your
title
to
it
is
made
good
for
that
reason
he
would
move
heaven
and
earth
to
stay
your
succession
by
casting
doubts
upon
your
claim
and
to
this
end
he
has
by
all
the
means
at
his
command
tried
to
provoke
your
cousin
to
contest
your
right
my
cousin
cries
moll
richard
godwin
my
cousin
richard
why
where
is
he
gone
says
the
old
woman
pointing
to
the
broken
bread
upon
the
table
chapter
xxii
moll
and
godwin
come
together
and
declare
their
passion
and
how
i
carry
these
tidings
to
what
cries
moll
starting
to
her
feet
he
whom
i
have
treated
thus
is
and
here
she
checked
herself
as
if
recoiling
and
for
the
first
time
from
false
pretence
in
a
matter
so
near
her
heart
he
is
your
cousin
richard
godwin
says
the
wise
woman
simon
knew
this
from
the
first
for
there
were
letters
showing
it
in
the
he
found
after
the
struggle
in
the
park
but
for
his
own
ends
he
kept
that
knowledge
secret
until
it
fitted
his
ends
to
speak
why
your
cousin
did
not
reveal
himself
to
you
may
be
more
readily
conceived
by
you
than
was
by
me
why
is
clear
enough
says
moll
pressed
by
his
necessities
he
came
hither
to
claim
assistance
of
his
kinsman
but
finding
he
was
dead
and
none
here
but
me
his
pride
did
shrink
from
begging
of
a
mere
maid
that
which
he
might
with
justice
have
demanded
from
a
man
and
then
for
shame
at
being
handled
like
a
rogue
surely
there
is
something
in
the
blood
of
a
gentleman
that
tempers
his
spirit
to
a
degree
scarcely
to
be
comprehended
by
men
of
meaner
birth
thinks
i
when
did
simon
urge
him
to
dispute
my
rights
asks
moll
on
sunday
in
the
wood
out
there
i
knew
by
his
look
he
had
some
treacherous
business
in
hand
and
matching
my
stealth
with
his
i
found
means
to
overhear
him
creeping
from
thicket
to
thicket
as
noiseless
as
a
snake
to
where
they
stood
for
be
assured
i
should
not
otherwise
have
learnt
one
word
of
this
how
did
receive
these
hints
at
my
ill
doing
asks
moll
patiently
till
the
tale
was
told
then
taking
your
steward
by
the
throat
with
sudden
passion
he
cries
should
i
not
strangle
you
rascal
be
a
service
to
humanity
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
your
love
or
this
lady
your
hate
nothing
you
would
pit
us
one
against
the
other
merely
to
keep
your
hold
upon
these
lands
and
gratify
your
insensate
love
of
possession
go
get
you
gone
beast
cries
he
flinging
him
off
tis
punishment
enough
for
you
to
live
and
know
you
failed
for
had
you
proved
your
case
to
my
conviction
i
not
stir
a
hand
against
this
lady
be
she
who
she
may
nay
adds
he
with
greater
fury
will
not
stay
where
my
loyalty
and
better
judgment
may
be
affected
by
the
contagion
of
a
vile
suspicion
away
while
you
may
my
fingers
itch
to
be
revenged
on
you
for
sundering
me
from
one
who
should
have
been
my
closest
dearest
friend
moll
claps
her
hands
together
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
pain
mingled
even
as
the
smile
played
upon
her
lips
whilst
tears
filled
her
eyes
sunday
cries
she
turning
to
me
and
dashing
the
tears
that
blinded
her
from
her
eyes
sunday
and
it
was
o
monday
he
refused
to
stay
o
the
brave
heart
then
in
impetuous
haste
he
shall
be
found
we
must
overtake
him
that
may
be
done
if
you
take
horse
says
anne
fitch
for
he
travels
afoot
but
which
way
shall
we
turn
the
way
that
any
man
would
take
seeking
to
dispel
a
useless
sorrow
answers
the
wise
woman
the
way
to
london
god
bless
you
cries
moll
clasping
the
withered
old
woman
to
her
heaving
breast
and
kissing
her
then
the
next
moment
she
would
be
gone
bidding
me
get
horses
for
our
pursuit
so
as
quickly
as
i
might
i
procured
a
couple
of
nags
and
we
set
out
leaving
a
message
for
don
sanchez
who
was
not
yet
astir
and
we
should
have
gone
empty
but
that
while
the
horses
were
and
moll
despite
her
mighty
haste
at
this
business
too
i
took
the
precaution
to
put
some
store
of
victuals
in
a
saddle
bag
reckoning
that
godwin
as
i
must
henceforth
call
him
had
been
set
out
two
hours
or
thereabouts
i
considered
that
we
might
overtake
him
in
about
three
at
an
easy
amble
but
moll
was
in
no
mood
for
ambling
and
no
sooner
were
we
started
than
she
put
her
nag
to
a
gallop
and
kept
up
this
reckless
pace
up
hill
and
down
dale
i
trailing
behind
and
expecting
every
minute
to
be
cast
and
get
my
neck
broke
until
her
horse
was
spent
and
would
answer
no
more
to
the
whip
then
i
begged
her
for
mercy
sake
to
take
the
hill
we
were
coming
to
at
a
walk
and
break
her
fast
for
says
i
another
such
as
the
last
on
an
empty
stomach
will
do
my
business
and
you
will
have
another
dead
man
to
bring
back
to
life
which
will
advance
your
journey
nothing
and
so
more
haste
less
speed
therewith
i
opened
my
saddle
bag
and
sharing
its
contents
we
ate
a
rare
good
meal
and
very
merry
and
indeed
it
was
a
pleasure
now
to
look
at
her
as
great
as
the
pain
had
been
to
see
her
so
unhappy
a
few
hours
before
for
the
exercise
had
brought
a
flood
of
rich
colour
into
her
face
and
a
lively
hope
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
like
any
peal
of
marriage
bells
for
gaiety
yet
now
and
then
her
tongue
would
falter
and
she
would
strain
a
wistful
glance
along
the
road
before
us
as
fearing
she
did
hope
too
much
however
coming
to
an
inn
we
made
enquiry
and
learnt
that
a
man
such
as
we
described
had
surely
passed
the
house
barely
an
hour
gone
and
one
adding
that
he
carried
a
basket
on
his
stick
we
felt
this
must
be
our
painter
for
certain
thence
on
again
at
another
tear
as
if
we
were
flying
from
our
reckoning
until
turning
a
bend
of
the
road
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
she
suddenly
drew
rein
with
a
shrill
cry
and
coming
up
i
perceived
close
by
our
side
godwin
seated
upon
the
bridge
that
crossed
a
stream
with
his
wallet
beside
him
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
caught
in
an
instant
the
rein
that
had
fallen
from
moll
hand
for
the
commotion
in
her
heart
at
seeing
him
so
suddenly
had
stopped
the
current
of
her
veins
and
she
was
deadly
pale
take
me
take
me
cries
she
stretching
forth
her
arms
with
a
faint
voice
take
me
or
i
must
fall
and
slipping
from
her
saddle
she
sank
into
his
open
ready
arms
help
says
godwin
quickly
and
in
terror
nay
says
she
i
am
better
is
nothing
but
adds
she
smiling
at
him
you
may
hold
me
yet
a
little
longer
the
fervid
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
gazed
down
at
her
sweet
pale
face
seemed
to
say
would
i
could
hold
you
here
for
ever
sweetheart
rest
her
here
says
i
pointing
to
the
little
wall
of
the
bridge
and
he
complying
not
too
willingly
withdrew
his
arm
from
her
waist
with
a
sigh
and
now
the
colour
coming
back
to
her
cheek
moll
turns
to
him
and
says
i
thought
you
would
have
come
again
and
since
one
of
us
must
ask
to
be
forgiven
lo
here
am
i
come
to
ask
your
pardon
why
what
is
there
to
pardon
madam
says
he
only
a
girl
folly
which
unforgiven
must
seem
something
worse
your
utmost
folly
says
he
is
to
have
been
to
a
poor
painter
and
if
that
be
an
offence
is
my
misfortune
to
be
no
more
offended
have
i
been
says
moll
abashed
as
having
unwittingly
passed
the
bounds
of
maiden
modesty
as
nature
will
be
in
one
season
strewing
so
many
flowers
in
our
path
that
we
do
underprize
them
till
they
are
lost
and
all
the
world
seems
stricken
with
wintry
desolation
yet
if
i
have
said
or
done
anything
unbecoming
to
my
sex
nothing
womanly
is
unbecoming
to
a
woman
returns
he
and
praised
be
god
some
still
live
who
have
not
learned
to
conceal
their
nature
under
a
mask
of
fashion
if
this
be
due
less
to
your
natural
free
disposition
than
to
an
ignorance
of
our
enlightened
modish
arts
then
could
i
find
it
in
my
heart
to
rejoice
that
you
have
lived
a
captive
in
barbary
they
had
been
looking
into
each
other
eyes
with
the
delight
of
reading
there
the
love
that
filled
their
hearts
but
now
moll
bent
her
head
as
if
she
could
no
longer
bear
that
searching
regard
and
unable
to
make
response
to
his
pretty
speech
sat
twining
her
fingers
in
her
lap
silent
with
pain
and
pleasure
fluttering
over
her
downcast
face
and
at
this
time
i
do
think
she
was
as
near
as
may
be
on
the
point
of
confessing
she
had
been
no
barbary
slave
rather
than
deceive
the
man
who
loved
her
and
profit
by
his
faith
in
her
which
had
certainly
undone
us
all
but
in
her
passion
a
woman
considered
the
welfare
of
her
father
and
best
friends
very
lightly
nay
she
will
not
value
her
own
body
and
soul
at
two
straws
but
is
ready
to
yield
up
everything
for
one
dear
smile
a
full
minute
godwin
sat
gazing
at
moll
pretty
blushing
face
as
if
for
his
last
solace
and
then
rising
slowly
from
the
little
parapet
he
says
had
i
been
more
generous
i
should
have
spared
you
this
long
morning
ride
so
you
have
something
to
forgive
and
we
may
cry
quits
then
stretching
forth
his
hand
he
adds
farewell
stay
cries
moll
springing
to
her
feet
as
fearing
to
lose
him
suddenly
again
i
have
not
eased
myself
of
the
burden
that
lay
uppermost
oh
cries
she
passionately
casting
off
all
reserve
i
know
all
who
you
are
and
why
you
first
came
hither
and
i
am
here
to
offer
you
the
half
of
all
i
have
half
sweet
cousin
answers
he
taking
her
two
hands
in
his
aye
for
if
i
had
not
come
to
claim
it
all
would
have
been
yours
by
right
and
is
no
more
than
fair
that
owing
so
much
to
fortune
i
should
offer
you
the
half
suppose
that
half
will
not
suffice
me
dear
says
he
why
then
i
give
you
all
answers
she
houses
gardens
everything
then
what
will
you
do
coz
go
hence
as
you
were
going
but
just
now
answers
she
trembling
why
that
as
if
you
took
the
diamond
from
its
setting
and
left
me
nothing
but
the
foil
says
he
oh
i
would
order
it
another
way
give
me
the
gem
and
let
who
will
take
what
remains
unless
these
little
hands
are
mine
to
hold
for
ever
i
will
take
nothing
from
them
they
are
thine
dear
love
cries
she
in
a
transport
flinging
them
about
his
neck
and
my
heart
as
well
at
this
conjuncture
i
thought
it
advisable
to
steal
softly
away
to
the
bend
of
the
road
for
surely
any
one
coming
this
way
by
accident
and
finding
them
locked
together
thus
in
tender
embrace
on
the
highway
would
have
fallen
to
some
gross
conclusion
not
understanding
their
circumstances
and
so
might
have
offended
their
delicacy
by
some
rude
jest
and
i
had
not
parted
myself
here
a
couple
of
minutes
ere
i
spied
a
team
of
four
stout
horses
coming
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
drawing
the
stage
waggon
behind
them
which
plies
betwixt
sevenoaks
and
london
this
prompting
me
to
a
happy
notion
i
returned
to
the
happy
smiling
pair
who
were
now
seated
again
upon
the
bridge
hand
in
hand
and
says
i
my
dear
friends
for
so
i
think
i
may
now
count
you
sir
as
well
as
my
mistress
judith
here
the
waggon
is
coming
down
the
hill
by
which
i
had
intended
to
go
to
london
this
morning
upon
some
pressing
business
and
so
madam
if
your
cousin
will
take
my
horse
and
conduct
you
back
to
the
court
i
will
profit
by
this
occasion
and
bid
you
farewell
for
the
present
this
proposal
was
received
with
evident
satisfaction
on
their
part
for
there
was
clearly
no
further
thought
of
parting
only
moll
alarmed
for
the
proprieties
did
beg
her
lover
to
lift
her
on
her
horse
instantly
nevertheless
when
she
was
in
her
saddle
they
must
linger
yet
he
to
kiss
her
hands
and
she
to
bend
down
and
yield
her
cheek
to
his
lips
though
the
sound
of
the
coming
waggon
was
close
at
hand
scarcely
less
delighted
than
they
with
this
surprising
strange
turn
of
events
i
left
there
with
bright
smiling
faces
and
journeyed
on
to
london
and
there
taking
a
pair
of
oars
at
the
bridge
to
greenwich
all
eagerness
to
give
these
joyful
tidings
to
my
old
friend
jack
dawson
i
found
him
in
his
workroom
before
a
lathe
and
sprinkled
from
head
to
toe
with
chips
mighty
proud
of
a
he
was
and
it
did
my
heart
good
to
see
him
looking
stout
and
hearty
profitably
occupied
in
this
business
instead
of
soaking
in
an
alehouse
as
i
feared
at
one
time
he
would
to
dull
his
care
but
he
was
ever
a
stout
brave
fellow
who
would
rather
fight
than
give
in
any
day
a
better
man
never
lived
nor
a
more
honest
circumstances
permitting
his
joy
at
seeing
me
was
past
everything
but
his
first
thought
after
our
hearty
greeting
was
of
his
daughter
my
moll
says
he
my
dear
girl
you
ha
brought
her
to
add
to
my
joy
she
not
slinking
behind
a
door
to
fright
me
with
delight
hey
no
says
i
but
i
brought
you
great
news
of
her
and
good
i
swear
kit
for
there
not
a
sad
line
in
your
face
stay
comrade
wait
till
i
shook
these
chips
off
and
we
are
seated
in
my
parlour
for
i
do
love
to
have
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
a
mug
of
ale
beside
me
in
times
of
pleasure
you
can
talk
of
indifferent
things
though
for
lord
i
do
love
to
hear
the
sound
of
your
voice
again
i
told
him
how
the
ceiling
of
our
had
been
painted
aye
says
he
i
have
heard
of
that
for
my
dear
girl
hath
writ
about
that
and
nought
else
in
her
letters
and
though
i
no
great
fancy
for
such
matters
yet
i
doubt
not
it
is
mighty
fine
by
her
praises
of
it
come
kit
let
us
in
here
and
get
to
something
fresher
so
we
into
his
parlour
which
was
a
neat
cheerful
room
with
a
fine
view
of
the
river
and
there
being
duly
furnished
with
a
mighty
mug
of
ale
and
clean
pipes
he
bids
me
give
him
my
news
and
i
tell
him
how
moll
had
fallen
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
the
painter
and
he
with
her
and
how
that
very
morning
they
had
come
together
and
laid
open
their
hearts
desire
one
to
the
other
with
the
result
as
i
believed
that
they
would
be
married
as
soon
as
they
could
get
a
parson
to
do
their
business
this
is
brave
news
indeed
cries
he
and
easeth
me
beyond
comprehension
for
i
could
see
clearly
enough
she
was
smitten
with
this
painter
by
her
writing
of
nothing
else
and
seeing
she
could
not
get
at
his
true
name
and
condition
i
felt
some
qualms
as
to
how
the
matter
might
end
but
do
tell
me
kit
is
he
an
honest
wholesome
sort
of
man
as
honest
as
the
day
says
i
and
a
nobler
handsomer
man
never
breathed
god
be
praised
for
all
things
says
he
devoutly
tell
me
he
an
englishman
kit
as
moll
did
seem
to
think
he
was
spite
his
foreign
name
and
my
joy
complete
as
an
englishman
as
you
are
says
i
lord
love
him
for
it
cries
he
then
coming
down
to
particulars
i
related
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
pretty
much
as
i
have
writ
them
here
showing
in
the
end
how
godwin
would
have
gone
away
unknown
rather
than
profit
by
his
claim
as
sir
richard
godwin
kinsman
even
though
moll
should
be
no
better
than
old
simon
would
have
him
believe
upon
which
he
cries
lord
love
him
for
it
say
i
again
let
us
drink
to
their
health
drink
deep
kit
for
i
a
fancy
that
no
man
shall
put
his
lips
to
this
mug
after
us
so
i
drank
heartily
and
he
emptying
the
jug
flung
it
behind
the
chimney
with
another
fervent
ejaculation
of
gratitude
then
a
shade
of
sorrow
falling
on
his
face
as
he
lay
it
in
his
hand
his
elbow
resting
on
the
table
i
give
best
half
of
the
years
i
got
to
live
says
he
to
see
together
and
grasp
godwin
hand
in
mine
but
i
not
be
tempted
to
it
for
i
perceive
clearly
enough
by
what
you
tell
me
that
my
wayward
tongue
and
weakness
have
been
undoing
us
all
and
ruining
my
dear
chance
of
happiness
but
tell
me
kit
straightening
himself
up
how
think
you
this
marriage
will
touch
our
affairs
only
to
better
them
for
henceforth
our
prosperity
is
assured
which
otherwise
might
have
lacked
security
aye
to
be
sure
for
now
shall
we
be
all
in
one
family
with
these
godwins
and
this
cousin
profiting
by
the
estate
as
much
as
moll
will
never
begrudge
her
giving
us
a
hundred
or
two
now
and
then
for
rendering
him
such
good
service
appease
moll
compunctions
into
the
bargain
says
i
heedlessly
what
compunctions
the
word
slipped
me
unintended
stammers
i
i
mean
nothing
but
something
your
word
must
mean
come
out
with
it
kit
well
says
i
since
this
fondness
has
possessed
her
i
have
observed
a
greater
compunction
to
telling
of
lies
than
she
was
wont
to
have
is
my
fault
answers
he
sadly
she
gets
this
leaning
to
honesty
from
me
this
very
morning
continues
i
she
was
i
truly
believe
of
two
minds
whether
she
should
not
confess
to
her
sweetheart
that
she
was
not
his
cousin
for
all
the
world
my
case
cries
he
slapping
the
table
if
i
could
only
have
five
minutes
in
secret
with
the
dear
girl
i
would
give
her
a
hint
that
should
make
her
profit
by
my
folly
and
then
he
tells
me
how
in
the
heyday
of
courtship
and
the
flush
of
confiding
love
he
did
confess
to
his
wife
that
he
had
carried
gallantry
somewhat
too
far
with
sukey
taylor
and
might
have
added
a
good
half
dozen
other
names
beside
hers
but
for
her
sudden
outcry
and
how
though
she
might
very
well
have
suspected
other
amours
she
did
never
reproach
him
therewith
but
was
for
ever
to
her
dying
day
sukey
taylor
in
his
teeth
etc
lord
kit
cries
he
in
conclusion
what
would
i
give
to
save
her
from
such
torment
you
know
how
obedient
she
is
to
my
guiding
for
i
have
ever
studied
to
make
her
respect
me
and
no
one
in
the
world
hath
such
empire
over
her
could
it
not
be
contrived
anyhow
that
we
should
meet
for
half
an
hour
secretly
not
secretly
says
i
but
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
visit
her
openly
nay
it
will
create
less
surprise
than
if
you
stay
away
for
what
could
be
more
natural
than
your
coming
to
the
court
on
your
return
from
a
voyage
to
see
the
lady
you
risked
so
much
to
save
now
god
bless
you
for
a
good
true
friend
cries
he
clasping
my
hand
i
come
but
to
stay
no
great
length
not
a
drop
will
i
touch
that
day
and
a
fool
indeed
i
must
be
if
i
ca
act
my
part
without
bungling
for
a
few
hours
at
a
stretch
and
i
every
night
in
the
parlour
of
the
dog
to
old
seamen
swearing
and
singing
their
songs
and
i
find
an
opportunity
to
give
moll
a
hint
of
my
past
folly
and
so
rescue
her
from
a
like
pitfall
i
abide
by
your
advice
kit
which
is
the
wisest
i
ever
heard
from
your
lips
but
i
was
not
so
sure
of
this
and
remembering
the
kind
of
obedience
moll
had
used
to
yield
to
her
father
commands
my
mind
misgave
me
chapter
xxiii
sanchez
proposes
a
very
artful
way
to
make
godwin
a
party
to
our
knavery
i
returned
to
hurst
court
the
following
day
in
the
forenoon
and
there
i
found
godwin
with
moll
clinging
to
his
arm
in
an
upper
room
commanding
a
view
of
the
northern
slopes
discussing
their
future
and
moll
told
me
with
glee
how
this
room
was
to
be
her
husband
workroom
where
he
would
paint
pictures
for
the
admiration
of
all
the
world
saying
that
he
would
not
nor
would
she
have
him
renounce
his
calling
to
lead
the
idle
life
of
a
country
gentleman
if
the
world
admire
my
pictures
the
world
shall
pay
to
have
them
says
he
with
a
smile
then
turning
to
her
he
adds
very
tenderly
i
will
owe
all
my
happiness
to
you
sweetheart
yet
guard
my
independence
in
more
material
matters
no
mercenary
question
shall
ever
cast
suspicion
on
my
love
seeing
i
was
not
wanted
here
i
left
them
to
settle
their
prospectives
and
sought
don
sanchez
whom
i
found
reading
in
a
room
below
seated
in
a
comfortable
chair
before
a
good
fire
of
apple
logs
to
please
me
he
shut
up
his
book
and
agreed
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
park
while
dinner
was
so
we
clap
on
our
hats
and
cloaks
and
set
forth
talking
of
indifferent
matters
till
we
are
come
into
a
fair
open
glade
which
sort
of
place
the
prudent
don
did
ever
prefer
to
holes
and
corners
for
secret
conference
and
then
he
told
me
how
moll
and
godwin
had
already
decided
they
would
be
married
in
three
weeks
three
weeks
says
i
i
would
it
were
to
be
done
in
three
days
to
which
desire
the
don
coincides
with
sundry
grave
nods
and
then
tells
me
how
moll
would
have
herself
cried
in
church
for
all
to
know
and
that
nothing
may
be
wanting
to
her
husband
dignity
after
all
says
i
three
weeks
is
no
such
great
matter
and
now
señor
do
tell
me
what
you
think
of
all
this
if
you
had
had
the
ordering
of
your
own
destiny
you
could
not
have
contrived
it
better
answers
he
is
a
most
excellent
game
and
you
can
not
fail
to
win
if
here
he
pauses
to
blow
his
nose
if
the
cards
are
played
properly
this
somehow
brought
dawson
into
my
thoughts
and
i
told
the
don
of
my
visit
to
him
and
how
he
did
purpose
to
come
down
to
see
moll
whereat
the
don
stopping
short
looked
at
me
very
curiously
with
his
eyebrows
raised
but
saying
nothing
is
no
more
than
natural
that
a
father
should
want
to
see
what
kind
of
man
is
to
be
his
daughter
husband
says
i
in
excuse
and
if
he
come
what
are
we
to
do
i
know
what
i
should
do
in
your
place
hopkins
says
he
quietly
pray
señor
what
is
that
squeeze
all
the
money
you
can
out
of
old
simon
before
he
comes
answers
he
and
it
would
be
amiss
to
make
godwin
party
to
this
business
by
letting
him
have
a
hundred
or
two
for
his
present
necessities
at
once
acting
on
this
hint
when
moll
left
us
after
supper
and
we
three
men
were
seated
before
the
fire
i
asked
godwin
if
he
would
permit
me
to
speak
upon
a
matter
which
concerned
his
happiness
no
less
than
his
cousin
judith
nay
sir
replies
he
i
do
pray
you
to
be
open
with
me
for
otherwise
i
must
consider
myself
unworthy
of
your
friendship
well
sir
says
i
my
mind
is
somewhat
concerned
on
account
of
what
you
said
this
morning
namely
that
no
pecuniary
question
shall
ever
be
discussed
betwixt
you
and
your
wife
and
that
you
will
owe
nothing
to
her
but
happiness
this
together
with
your
purpose
of
painting
pictures
to
sell
means
i
take
it
that
you
will
leave
your
wife
absolute
mistress
of
her
present
fortune
that
is
the
case
exactly
hopkins
says
he
i
am
not
indifferent
to
the
world
esteem
and
i
would
give
no
one
reason
to
suspect
that
i
had
married
my
dear
cousin
to
possess
her
fortune
nevertheless
sir
you
would
not
have
it
thought
that
she
begrudged
you
an
equal
share
of
her
possessions
your
position
will
necessitate
a
certain
outlay
to
maintain
your
wife
dignity
and
your
own
you
must
dress
well
mount
a
good
horse
be
liberal
in
hospitality
give
largely
to
those
in
need
and
so
forth
with
all
due
respect
to
your
genius
in
painting
i
can
scarcely
think
that
art
will
furnish
you
at
once
with
supplies
necessary
to
meet
all
these
demands
all
this
is
very
true
hopkins
says
he
after
a
little
reflection
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
lived
so
long
in
want
that
poverty
has
become
my
second
nature
and
so
these
matters
have
not
entered
into
my
calculations
pray
sir
continue
your
wife
be
she
never
so
considerate
may
not
always
anticipate
your
needs
and
hence
at
some
future
moment
this
question
of
supplies
must
arise
unless
they
are
disposed
of
before
your
marriage
if
that
could
be
done
hopkins
says
he
hopefully
it
may
be
done
sir
very
easily
with
your
cousin
consent
and
yours
i
as
her
elected
guardian
at
this
time
will
have
a
deed
drawn
up
to
be
signed
by
you
and
her
settling
the
estate
upon
you
and
the
other
on
your
cousin
this
will
make
you
not
her
debtor
but
her
benefactor
for
without
this
deed
all
that
is
now
hers
becomes
yours
by
legal
right
upon
your
marriage
and
she
could
not
justly
give
away
a
shilling
without
your
permission
and
thus
you
assure
to
her
the
same
independence
that
you
yourself
would
maintain
very
good
says
don
sanchez
in
a
sonorous
voice
of
approval
as
he
lies
back
in
his
high
chair
his
eyes
closed
and
a
cigarro
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
hopkins
says
godwin
warmly
i
entreat
you
have
this
deed
drawn
up
if
it
be
my
wife
wish
you
may
count
with
certainty
on
that
says
i
for
if
my
arguments
lacked
power
i
have
but
to
say
is
your
desire
and
be
done
though
it
took
the
last
penny
from
her
he
made
no
reply
to
this
but
bending
forward
he
gazed
into
the
fire
with
a
rapture
in
his
face
pressing
one
hand
within
the
other
as
if
it
were
his
sweetheart
in
the
meantime
says
i
if
you
have
necessity
for
a
hundred
or
two
in
advance
you
have
but
to
give
me
your
note
of
hand
can
you
do
me
this
service
cries
he
eagerly
can
you
let
me
have
five
hundred
by
i
believe
i
can
supply
you
to
the
extent
of
six
or
seven
all
that
you
can
says
he
for
besides
a
pressing
need
that
will
take
me
to
london
i
owe
something
to
a
friend
here
that
i
would
fain
discharge
don
sanchez
waived
his
hand
cavalierly
though
i
do
believe
the
subtle
spaniard
had
hinted
at
this
business
as
much
for
his
own
ends
as
for
our
assurance
i
will
have
it
ready
against
we
meet
in
the
morning
says
i
you
are
so
certain
of
her
sanction
he
asks
in
delight
as
if
he
could
not
too
much
assure
himself
of
moll
devotion
she
has
been
guided
by
me
in
all
matters
relating
to
her
estate
and
will
be
in
this
i
am
convinced
but
here
another
question
sir
which
while
we
are
about
business
might
be
discussed
with
advantage
my
rule
here
is
nearly
at
an
end
have
you
decided
who
shall
govern
the
estate
when
i
am
gone
only
that
when
i
have
authority
that
rascal
simon
shall
be
turned
from
his
office
neck
and
crop
he
loves
me
as
little
as
he
loves
his
mistress
that
he
would
set
us
by
the
ears
for
his
own
advantage
an
honest
man
nevertheless
in
his
peculiar
way
observes
the
don
honest
cries
godwin
hotly
he
honest
who
would
have
suffered
judith
to
die
in
barbary
he
shall
go
then
you
will
take
in
your
own
hands
the
control
of
your
joint
estate
i
why
i
know
no
more
of
such
matters
than
the
man
in
the
moon
with
all
respect
to
your
cousin
abilities
i
can
not
think
her
qualified
for
this
office
surely
another
steward
can
be
found
undoubtedly
says
i
but
surely
sir
you
not
trust
all
to
him
without
some
supervision
large
sums
of
money
must
pass
through
his
hands
and
this
must
prove
a
great
temptation
to
dishonest
practices
not
be
fair
to
any
man
this
is
true
says
he
and
yet
from
natural
disinclination
ignorance
and
other
reasons
i
would
keep
out
of
it
then
after
some
reflection
he
adds
my
cousin
has
told
me
how
you
have
lost
all
your
fortune
in
saving
her
and
that
is
not
yet
possible
to
repay
you
may
i
ask
sir
without
offence
if
you
have
any
occupation
for
your
time
when
you
leave
us
i
went
to
london
when
i
left
you
to
see
what
might
be
done
but
a
merchant
without
money
is
like
a
carpenter
without
tools
then
sir
till
your
debt
is
discharged
or
you
can
find
some
more
pleasant
and
profitable
engagement
would
you
not
consent
to
govern
these
affairs
i
do
not
ask
you
to
stay
here
though
assuredly
you
will
ever
be
a
welcome
guest
but
if
you
would
have
one
of
the
houses
on
the
estate
or
come
hither
from
time
to
time
as
it
might
fit
your
other
purposes
and
take
this
office
as
a
matter
of
business
i
should
regard
it
as
a
most
generous
friendly
kindness
on
your
part
i
promised
him
with
some
demur
and
yet
with
the
civility
his
offer
demanded
to
consider
of
this
and
so
our
debate
ended
and
i
went
to
bed
very
well
content
with
myself
for
thus
will
vanity
blind
us
to
our
faults
chapter
xxiv
overcome
moll
honest
compunctions
lay
hold
of
three
thousand
pounds
more
and
do
otherwise
play
the
part
of
rascal
to
i
got
together
six
hundred
pounds
out
of
the
sum
left
us
after
paying
don
sanchez
his
ten
thousand
and
delivered
to
godwin
against
his
note
of
hand
telling
him
at
the
same
time
that
having
slept
upon
his
proposal
i
was
resolved
to
be
his
steward
for
three
months
with
freedom
on
both
sides
to
alter
our
position
according
to
our
convenience
at
the
end
of
that
time
and
would
serve
him
and
his
lady
to
the
best
of
my
power
thanking
me
very
heartily
for
my
friendly
service
to
him
though
god
knows
with
little
reason
he
presently
left
us
and
moll
coming
back
from
taking
tender
leave
of
him
at
her
gates
appeared
very
downcast
and
pensive
however
after
moping
an
hour
in
her
chamber
she
comes
to
me
in
her
hood
and
begs
i
will
take
her
a
walk
to
dispel
her
vapours
so
we
out
across
the
common
it
being
a
fine
brisk
dry
morning
and
the
ground
hard
with
a
frost
here
being
secure
from
observation
i
showed
her
how
i
had
settled
matters
with
godwin
dividing
the
estate
in
such
a
manner
as
would
enable
her
to
draw
what
funds
she
pleased
without
let
hindrance
or
any
inconvenient
question
at
this
she
draws
a
deep
sigh
fixing
her
eyes
sadly
enough
on
the
perspective
as
if
she
were
thinking
rather
of
her
absent
lover
than
the
business
in
hand
somewhat
nettled
to
find
she
prized
my
efforts
on
her
behalf
so
lightly
i
proceeded
to
show
her
the
advantages
of
this
arrangement
adding
that
to
make
her
property
the
surer
i
had
consented
to
manage
both
her
affairs
and
godwin
when
they
were
married
and
so
says
i
in
conclusion
you
may
have
what
money
you
want
and
dispose
of
it
as
you
will
and
i
answer
for
it
godwin
shall
never
be
a
penny
the
wiser
do
what
you
find
is
necessary
says
she
with
passion
but
for
mercy
sake
say
no
more
on
this
matter
to
me
for
all
these
hints
do
stab
my
heart
like
sharp
knives
not
reading
rightly
the
cause
of
her
petulance
i
was
at
first
disposed
to
resent
it
but
reflecting
that
a
maiden
is
no
more
responsible
for
her
tongue
than
a
donkey
for
his
heels
in
this
season
of
life
but
both
must
be
for
ever
out
at
some
one
when
parted
from
the
object
of
their
affections
i
held
my
peace
and
so
we
walked
on
in
sullen
silence
for
a
space
then
turning
suddenly
upon
me
she
cries
in
a
trembling
voice
wo
you
say
something
to
me
ca
you
see
that
i
am
unhappy
and
now
seeing
her
eyes
full
of
tears
her
lips
quivering
and
her
face
drawn
with
pain
my
heart
melted
in
a
moment
so
taking
her
arm
under
mine
and
pressing
it
to
my
side
i
bade
her
be
of
good
cheer
for
her
lover
would
return
in
a
day
or
two
at
the
outside
no
not
of
him
not
of
him
she
entreats
talk
to
me
of
indifferent
things
so
thinking
to
turn
her
thoughts
to
another
furrow
i
told
her
how
i
had
been
to
visit
her
father
at
greenwich
my
father
says
she
stopping
short
oh
what
a
heartless
selfish
creature
am
i
i
have
not
thought
of
him
in
my
happiness
nay
had
he
been
dead
i
could
not
have
forgot
him
more
you
saw
him
is
he
well
as
hearty
as
you
could
wish
and
full
of
love
for
you
and
rejoiced
beyond
measure
to
know
you
are
to
marry
a
brave
honest
gentleman
then
i
told
how
we
had
drunk
to
their
health
and
how
her
father
had
smashed
his
mug
for
a
fancy
and
this
bringing
a
smile
to
her
cheek
i
went
on
to
tell
how
he
craved
to
see
godwin
and
grip
his
hand
oh
if
he
could
see
what
a
noble
handsome
man
my
richard
is
cries
she
i
do
think
my
heart
would
ache
for
pride
why
so
it
shall
says
i
for
your
father
does
intend
to
come
hither
before
long
he
is
coming
to
see
my
dear
husband
says
she
her
face
aglow
with
joy
aye
but
he
does
promise
to
be
most
circumspect
and
appear
as
if
returning
from
a
voyage
he
had
come
but
to
see
how
you
fare
and
will
stay
no
longer
than
is
reasonably
civil
only
that
says
she
her
countenance
falling
again
we
are
to
hide
our
love
pretend
indifference
behave
towards
this
dear
father
as
if
he
were
nought
to
me
but
a
friend
my
dear
says
i
is
no
new
part
you
have
to
play
i
know
it
she
answers
hotly
but
that
makes
it
only
the
worse
well
what
would
you
anything
with
passion
i
would
do
anything
but
cheat
and
cozen
the
man
i
love
then
after
some
moments
silence
o
both
sides
oh
if
i
were
really
judith
godwin
if
you
were
she
you
be
in
barbary
now
and
have
neither
father
nor
lover
is
that
what
you
want
says
i
with
some
impatience
bear
with
me
says
she
with
a
humility
as
strange
in
her
as
these
scruples
of
conscience
you
may
be
sure
of
this
my
dear
says
i
in
a
gentler
tone
if
you
were
anything
but
what
you
are
godwin
would
not
marry
you
why
then
not
tell
him
what
i
am
asks
she
boldly
that
means
that
you
would
be
what
you
not
if
he
told
me
he
had
done
wrong
i
could
forgive
him
and
love
him
none
the
less
your
conditions
are
not
the
same
he
is
a
gentleman
by
birth
you
but
a
player
daughter
come
child
be
reasonable
ponder
this
matter
but
a
moment
justly
and
you
shall
see
that
you
have
all
to
lose
and
nought
to
gain
by
yielding
to
this
idle
fancy
is
he
lacking
in
affection
that
you
would
seek
to
stimulate
his
love
by
this
hazardous
experiment
oh
no
no
no
cries
she
would
he
be
happier
knowing
all
she
shakes
her
head
happier
if
you
force
him
to
give
you
up
and
seek
another
wife
she
starts
as
if
flicked
with
a
whip
would
be
happier
stripped
of
your
possessions
cast
out
of
your
house
and
forced
to
fly
from
justice
with
your
father
she
looks
at
me
in
pale
terror
why
then
nothing
to
be
won
and
what
to
lose
the
love
of
a
noble
honest
gentleman
the
joy
of
raising
him
from
penury
oh
say
no
more
cries
she
in
passion
i
know
not
what
madness
possessed
me
to
overlook
such
consequences
i
kiss
you
for
bringing
me
to
my
senses
with
that
she
catches
up
my
hand
and
presses
her
lips
to
it
again
and
again
look
in
my
face
cries
she
and
if
you
find
a
lurking
vestige
of
irresolution
there
i
tear
it
out
indeed
i
could
see
nothing
but
set
determination
in
her
countenance
a
most
hard
expression
of
fixed
resolve
that
seemed
to
age
her
by
ten
years
astonishing
me
not
less
than
those
other
phases
in
her
rapidly
developing
character
now
says
she
quickly
and
with
not
a
note
of
her
repining
tone
what
was
that
you
spoke
of
lately
you
are
to
be
our
steward
yes
says
i
for
godwin
has
declared
most
firmly
that
the
moment
he
has
authority
he
will
cast
simon
out
for
his
disloyalty
i
will
not
leave
that
ungrateful
duty
to
him
says
she
take
me
to
this
wretch
at
once
and
choose
the
shortest
path
i
led
her
back
across
the
common
and
coming
to
simon
lodge
she
herself
knocked
loudly
at
the
door
seeing
who
it
was
through
his
little
grating
simon
quickly
opens
the
door
and
with
fawning
humility
entreats
her
to
step
into
his
poor
room
and
there
he
stands
cringing
and
mopping
his
eyes
in
dreadful
apprehension
as
having
doubtless
gathered
from
some
about
the
house
how
matters
stood
betwixt
moll
and
godwin
where
are
your
keys
demands
moll
in
a
very
hard
merciless
voice
perceiving
how
the
land
lay
and
finding
himself
thus
beset
old
simon
falls
to
his
usual
artifices
turning
this
way
and
that
like
a
rat
in
a
pit
to
find
some
hole
for
escape
first
he
feigns
to
misunderstand
then
clapping
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
knows
not
where
he
can
have
laid
them
after
that
fancies
he
must
have
given
them
to
his
man
peter
who
is
gone
out
of
an
errand
etc
until
moll
losing
patience
cut
him
short
by
declaring
the
loss
of
the
keys
unimportant
as
doubtless
a
locksmith
could
be
found
to
open
his
boxes
and
drawers
without
my
chief
requirement
is
adds
she
that
you
leave
this
house
forthwith
and
return
no
more
upon
this
finding
further
evasion
impossible
the
old
man
turns
to
bay
and
asks
upon
what
grounds
she
would
dismiss
him
without
writ
or
warrant
is
sufficient
returns
she
that
this
house
is
mine
and
that
i
will
not
have
you
a
day
longer
for
my
tenant
or
my
servant
if
you
dispute
my
claim
as
i
am
told
you
do
you
may
take
what
lawful
means
you
please
to
dispossess
me
of
my
estate
and
at
the
same
time
redress
what
wrong
is
done
you
seeing
his
secret
treachery
discovered
simon
falls
now
to
his
whining
arts
telling
once
more
of
his
constant
toil
to
enrich
her
his
thrift
and
nay
he
even
carries
it
so
far
as
to
show
that
he
did
but
incite
godwin
to
dispute
her
title
to
the
estate
that
thereby
her
claim
should
be
justified
before
the
law
to
the
obtaining
of
her
succession
without
further
delay
and
at
the
expense
of
her
cousin
which
did
surpass
anything
i
had
ever
heard
of
for
artfulness
but
this
only
incensed
moll
the
more
what
cries
she
you
would
make
bad
blood
between
two
cousins
to
the
ruin
and
disgrace
of
one
merely
to
save
the
expense
of
some
beggarly
fees
i
hear
no
more
go
at
once
or
i
will
send
for
my
servants
to
carry
you
out
by
force
he
stood
some
moments
in
deliberation
and
then
he
says
with
a
certain
dignity
unusual
to
him
i
will
go
then
he
casts
his
eye
slowly
round
the
room
with
a
lingering
regard
for
his
piles
of
documents
and
precious
boxes
of
title
deeds
as
if
he
were
bidding
a
last
farewell
to
all
that
was
dear
to
him
on
earth
and
grotesque
as
his
appearance
might
be
there
was
yet
something
pathetic
in
it
but
even
at
this
moment
his
ruling
passion
prevailed
there
is
no
need
says
he
to
burst
these
goodly
locks
by
force
i
do
bethink
me
the
keys
are
here
opening
a
drawer
and
laying
them
upon
the
table
then
dropping
his
head
he
goes
slowly
to
the
door
but
there
he
turns
lifting
his
head
and
fixing
his
rheumy
eyes
on
moll
i
will
take
nothing
from
this
house
not
even
the
chattels
that
belong
to
me
bought
from
the
mean
wage
i
have
allowed
myself
so
shalt
thou
judge
of
my
honesty
they
shall
stand
here
till
i
return
for
that
i
shall
return
i
am
as
fully
persuaded
as
that
a
just
god
doth
dispose
of
his
creatures
thee
hast
might
on
thy
side
woman
but
whether
thee
hast
right
as
well
shall
yet
be
proven
not
by
the
laws
of
man
which
are
an
invention
of
the
devil
to
fatten
rogues
upon
the
substance
of
fools
but
by
the
law
of
heaven
to
which
i
do
appeal
with
all
my
soul
lifting
high
his
shaking
hands
morning
and
night
i
will
pray
that
god
shall
smite
with
heavy
hand
which
of
us
two
hath
most
wronged
the
other
offer
the
same
prayer
if
thee
darest
i
do
confess
that
this
parting
shot
went
home
to
my
conscience
and
troubled
my
mind
considerably
for
feeling
that
he
was
in
the
right
of
it
as
regarded
our
relative
honesty
i
was
constrained
to
think
that
his
prophecy
might
come
true
also
to
our
shame
and
undoing
but
moll
was
afflicted
with
no
such
qualms
her
spirit
being
very
combative
and
high
and
her
conscience
such
as
it
was
being
hardened
by
our
late
discussion
to
resist
sharper
slaps
than
this
nay
maintaining
that
simon
must
be
dishonest
by
the
proof
we
had
of
his
hypocrisy
and
double
dealing
she
would
have
me
enter
upon
my
office
at
once
by
sending
letters
to
all
her
tenants
warning
them
to
pay
no
rent
to
any
one
lately
in
her
service
but
only
to
me
and
these
letters
which
kept
my
pen
going
all
that
afternoon
she
signed
with
the
name
of
judith
godwin
which
seemed
to
me
a
very
bold
dangerous
piece
of
business
but
she
would
have
it
so
and
did
her
signature
with
a
strong
hand
and
a
flourish
of
loops
beneath
like
any
queen
nor
was
this
all
for
the
next
morning
she
would
have
me
go
to
that
goodman
who
had
offered
to
buy
her
farm
for
ready
money
and
get
what
i
could
from
him
seeing
that
she
must
furnish
herself
with
fresh
gowns
and
make
other
outlay
for
her
coming
marriage
so
to
him
i
go
and
after
much
haggling
having
learnt
from
simon
that
the
land
was
worth
more
than
he
offered
for
it
i
brought
him
to
give
six
thousand
pounds
instead
of
five
and
this
was
clearly
better
business
on
his
side
than
on
mine
at
that
for
that
the
bargain
might
not
slip
from
his
hands
he
would
have
me
take
three
thousand
pounds
down
as
a
handsell
leaving
the
rest
to
be
paid
when
the
deed
of
transference
was
drawn
up
and
now
as
i
jogged
home
with
all
this
gold
chinking
in
my
pockets
i
did
feel
that
i
had
thrust
my
head
fairly
into
a
halter
and
no
chance
left
of
drawing
it
out
look
at
it
how
i
might
this
business
wore
a
most
curst
aspect
to
be
sure
nor
could
i
regard
myself
as
anything
but
a
thoroughpaced
rogue
for
thinks
i
if
old
simon
prayer
be
answered
what
will
become
of
this
poor
goodman
his
title
deeds
will
be
wrested
from
him
for
they
are
but
stolen
goods
he
is
paying
for
and
thus
an
innocent
honest
man
will
be
utterly
ruined
and
for
doing
this
villany
i
may
count
myself
lucky
if
my
heels
save
my
neck
with
this
weight
on
my
mind
i
resolved
to
be
very
watchful
and
careful
of
my
safety
and
before
i
fell
asleep
that
night
i
had
devised
a
dozen
schemes
for
making
good
my
escape
as
soon
as
i
perceived
danger
nevertheless
i
could
dream
of
nothing
but
prisons
scourgings
and
in
every
vision
i
perceived
old
simon
in
his
leather
sitting
on
the
top
of
tyburn
tree
with
his
handkercher
down
ready
to
strangle
me
chapter
xxv
table
of
various
as
your
guide
showing
you
an
exhibition
of
paintings
will
linger
over
the
first
room
and
then
pass
the
second
in
hurried
review
to
come
the
quicker
to
a
third
of
greater
interest
so
i
having
dwelt
may
be
at
undue
length
upon
some
secondary
passages
in
this
history
must
economise
my
space
by
touching
lightly
on
the
events
that
came
immediately
before
moll
marriage
and
so
get
to
those
more
moving
accidents
which
followed
here
therefore
will
i
transcribe
certain
notes
forming
a
brief
chronicle
from
that
secret
journal
which
for
the
clearer
understanding
of
my
position
i
began
to
keep
the
day
i
took
possession
of
simon
lodge
and
entered
upon
my
new
office
very
busy
all
this
forenoon
setting
my
new
house
in
order
conveying
with
the
help
of
the
gardener
all
those
domestic
and
personal
goods
that
belong
to
simon
into
the
attick
but
lord
so
few
these
things
and
they
so
patched
and
worn
that
altogether
they
are
not
worth
ten
shillings
of
anybody
money
i
find
the
house
wondrous
neat
and
clean
in
every
part
but
so
comfortless
and
that
i
look
forward
with
little
relish
to
living
here
when
the
time
comes
for
me
to
leave
the
court
after
this
to
examining
books
papers
and
the
more
closely
i
look
into
these
the
more
assured
i
am
that
never
was
any
servant
more
scrupulous
exact
and
honest
in
his
master
service
than
this
old
steward
which
puts
me
to
the
hope
that
i
may
be
only
half
as
faithful
to
my
trust
as
he
but
i
do
fear
i
shall
not
conversing
privily
with
don
sanchez
after
dinner
he
gave
me
his
opinion
that
we
had
done
a
very
unwise
thing
in
turning
out
old
simon
showing
how
by
a
little
skill
i
might
have
persuaded
moll
to
leave
this
business
to
godwin
as
the
proper
ruler
of
her
estate
how
by
such
delay
godwin
resentment
would
have
abated
and
he
willing
to
listen
to
good
argument
in
the
steward
favour
how
then
we
should
have
made
simon
more
eager
than
ever
to
serve
us
in
order
to
condone
his
late
offence
and
how
by
abusing
our
opportunities
we
had
changed
this
useful
servant
to
a
dangerous
enemy
whose
sole
endeavour
must
be
to
undo
us
and
recover
his
former
position
etc
why
what
have
we
to
fear
of
this
miserable
old
man
says
i
unless
he
fetch
godwin
from
barbary
he
can
not
disprove
moll
right
to
the
estate
and
what
else
can
he
do
there
the
mischief
of
it
answers
he
is
because
you
know
not
how
he
may
attack
you
that
you
have
no
means
of
defending
yourself
is
ever
the
unseen
trifle
in
our
path
which
trips
us
up
and
dismissing
this
part
of
the
subject
with
a
hunch
of
his
shoulders
he
advises
me
seriously
to
sell
as
many
more
farms
as
i
may
for
ready
money
and
keep
it
in
some
secret
convenient
corner
where
i
may
lay
hands
on
it
at
a
moment
warning
this
discourse
coming
atop
of
a
night
ill
rest
depressed
my
mind
to
such
a
degree
that
i
could
take
no
interest
in
my
work
but
sat
there
in
my
naked
room
with
my
accounts
before
me
and
no
spirit
to
cast
up
nor
was
i
much
happier
when
i
gave
up
work
and
returned
to
the
court
for
besides
having
to
wait
an
hour
later
than
usual
for
dinner
treatment
of
me
was
none
of
the
best
she
being
particularly
perverse
and
contrary
for
having
dressed
herself
in
her
best
in
expectation
of
her
lover
return
and
he
not
coming
when
at
last
she
permitted
supper
to
be
dished
we
were
scarcely
seated
however
when
she
springs
up
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
runs
from
the
room
crying
she
hears
her
step
which
was
indeed
true
though
we
had
heard
nothing
more
pleasant
than
the
rattle
of
our
plates
presently
they
come
in
all
radiant
with
happiness
hand
in
hand
and
thenceforth
nought
but
sweetness
and
mirth
on
the
part
of
mistress
moll
who
before
had
been
all
frown
and
pout
at
supper
godwin
tells
us
how
his
sweetheart
hath
certainly
dispelled
the
clouds
that
have
hung
so
long
over
him
he
having
heard
in
london
that
sir
peter
lely
on
seeing
one
of
his
pieces
desires
to
see
him
at
hatfield
where
he
is
painting
on
good
business
and
to
hatfield
he
will
go
to
discharge
this
matter
before
his
marriage
which
joyeth
moll
less
than
me
i
being
pleased
to
see
he
is
still
of
the
same
stout
disposition
to
live
an
active
life
in
the
evening
he
gives
moll
a
very
beautiful
ring
for
a
troth
token
which
transports
her
with
joy
so
that
she
can
not
enough
caress
her
lover
or
this
toy
but
falls
first
to
kissing
one
and
then
in
a
rapture
in
return
she
gives
him
a
ring
from
her
finger
is
too
small
for
my
finger
love
says
he
but
i
will
wear
it
against
my
heart
as
long
as
it
beats
after
that
he
finds
another
case
and
puts
it
in
moll
hand
and
she
opening
it
fetches
her
breath
quickly
and
can
say
nothing
for
amazement
then
turning
it
in
the
light
she
regards
it
with
winking
eyes
as
if
dazzled
by
some
fierce
brilliancy
and
so
closing
the
case
as
if
it
were
too
much
for
her
she
lays
her
face
upon
godwin
breast
he
having
his
arm
about
her
murmuring
some
inarticulate
words
of
passionate
love
recovering
her
energies
presently
she
starts
up
and
putting
the
case
in
her
lover
hand
she
bids
him
put
on
his
gift
therewith
pulling
down
her
kerchief
to
expose
her
beautiful
bare
neck
whereupon
he
draws
from
the
box
a
diamond
collar
and
clasps
it
about
her
throat
with
a
pretty
speech
and
truly
this
was
a
gift
worthy
of
a
princess
the
most
beautiful
bauble
i
have
ever
seen
and
must
have
cost
him
all
he
had
of
me
to
the
last
shilling
finding
amongst
simon
quittances
a
bill
for
law
expenses
of
one
john
pearson
attorney
at
maidstone
i
concluded
this
must
be
the
most
trustworthy
man
of
his
kind
in
the
country
and
so
set
forth
early
this
morning
to
seek
him
a
tedious
long
journey
and
the
roads
exceedingly
foul
by
good
luck
i
found
pearson
at
home
a
very
civil
shrewd
man
as
i
think
having
laid
my
business
before
him
he
tells
me
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
dividing
the
estate
according
to
the
wish
of
godwin
and
moll
which
may
be
done
by
a
simple
deed
of
agreement
and
this
he
promises
to
draw
up
and
send
to
us
for
signature
in
a
couple
of
days
but
to
get
the
seal
to
moll
succession
will
not
be
such
an
easy
matter
and
unless
we
are
willing
to
give
seven
or
eight
hundred
pounds
in
fees
we
may
be
kept
waiting
a
year
with
the
chance
of
being
put
to
greater
expense
to
prove
our
right
for
he
tells
me
the
court
and
all
about
it
are
so
corrupt
that
no
minister
is
valued
if
he
do
not
by
straight
or
crooked
ways
draw
money
into
the
treasury
and
that
they
will
rather
impede
than
aid
the
course
of
justice
if
it
be
to
the
king
interest
and
that
none
will
stir
a
hand
to
the
advantage
of
any
one
but
the
king
unless
it
be
secretly
to
his
own
etc
and
though
he
will
say
nothing
against
simon
save
by
way
of
hint
that
all
men
must
be
counted
honest
till
they
are
proved
guilty
yet
he
do
apprehend
he
will
do
all
in
his
power
to
obstruct
the
granting
of
this
seal
which
it
is
only
reasonable
to
suppose
he
will
so
to
close
this
discussion
i
agree
he
shall
spend
as
much
as
one
thousand
pounds
in
bribery
and
he
thinks
we
may
certainly
look
to
have
it
in
a
month
at
that
price
home
late
and
very
sore
much
astonished
this
morning
on
going
to
my
house
to
find
all
changed
within
as
if
by
inchantment
fine
hangings
to
my
windows
handsome
furniture
in
every
room
all
arranged
in
due
order
with
a
pair
of
pictures
in
my
parlour
the
linen
press
stocked
with
all
that
is
needful
and
more
and
even
the
cellar
well
garnished
with
wines
etc
and
truly
thus
embellished
my
house
looks
no
longer
like
a
prison
but
as
cheerful
and
pleasant
a
as
the
heart
of
man
could
desire
in
moderation
and
better
than
any
i
have
yet
dreamt
of
possessing
and
was
easy
to
guess
whose
hands
had
worked
this
transformation
even
had
i
not
recognised
certain
pieces
of
furniture
as
coming
from
the
court
for
was
of
a
piece
with
moll
loving
and
playful
spirit
to
prepare
this
surprise
for
me
while
i
was
gone
yesterday
to
maidstone
i
am
resolved
i
will
sleep
here
henceforth
there
being
two
bedrooms
all
properly
furnished
as
being
more
in
keeping
with
my
new
position
this
day
a
little
before
dinner
time
came
dawson
to
the
court
quite
sober
and
looking
as
like
a
rough
honest
seaman
as
anything
could
be
but
evidently
with
his
best
manners
on
and
when
moll
very
graciously
offers
him
her
hand
he
whips
out
a
red
handkercher
and
lays
it
over
her
hand
before
kissing
it
which
was
a
piece
of
ceremony
he
must
have
observed
at
greenwich
as
also
many
odd
phrases
and
sea
expressions
with
which
he
garnished
his
conversation
captain
evans
says
moll
taking
her
lover
hand
this
is
godwin
my
cousin
and
soon
to
be
my
husband
godwin
holds
forth
his
hand
but
ere
he
would
take
it
dawson
looks
him
full
in
the
face
a
good
minute
then
taking
it
in
his
great
grimy
hand
and
grasping
it
firmly
master
says
jack
i
see
thou
art
an
honest
man
and
none
lives
who
hath
ever
sold
me
tar
for
pitch
be
he
never
so
and
so
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
sweet
wife
as
for
you
mistress
turning
to
moll
who
have
ever
been
kind
to
me
beyond
my
deserts
i
do
wish
you
all
the
happiness
in
the
world
and
i
count
all
my
hardships
well
paid
in
bringing
you
safely
to
this
anchorage
for
sure
i
would
sooner
you
were
still
lala
mollah
and
a
slave
in
barbary
than
the
queen
of
chiney
and
and
so
lord
love
the
both
of
you
after
staying
a
couple
of
hours
with
us
he
was
for
going
but
not
before
he
had
given
us
the
instructive
history
of
the
torment
he
had
endured
by
telling
his
wife
in
an
unguarded
moment
of
his
gallantries
with
sukey
taylor
nor
would
he
be
persuaded
to
sleep
at
the
court
and
leave
next
day
maintaining
that
whilst
he
had
never
a
penny
in
the
world
he
could
very
honestly
accept
moll
hospitality
but
that
now
being
thanks
to
her
bounty
he
blessed
heaven
he
had
sufficient
good
breeding
and
valued
himself
well
enough
not
to
take
advantage
of
her
beneficence
however
hearing
i
had
a
house
of
my
own
and
could
offer
him
a
bed
he
willingly
agreed
to
be
my
guest
for
the
night
regarding
me
as
one
of
his
own
quality
we
stayed
to
sup
at
the
court
where
he
entertained
us
with
a
lengthy
account
of
his
late
voyage
and
how
being
taken
in
a
tempest
his
masts
had
all
been
swept
by
the
board
and
his
craft
so
damaged
that
was
as
much
as
she
would
hold
together
till
he
brought
her
into
falmouth
where
she
must
lie
a
good
two
months
ere
he
could
again
venture
to
sea
in
her
and
this
story
he
told
with
such
an
abundance
of
detail
and
so
many
nautical
particulars
that
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
dreamt
he
was
lying
he
explained
to
me
later
on
that
he
had
refused
to
lie
at
the
court
for
fear
a
glass
or
two
after
supper
might
lead
his
tongue
astray
telling
me
that
he
had
touched
nothing
but
penny
ale
all
his
long
journey
from
london
for
fear
of
losing
his
head
and
on
my
asking
why
he
had
fabricated
that
long
history
of
shipwreck
he
vowed
i
had
put
him
to
it
by
saying
i
had
a
house
of
my
own
where
he
could
lie
for
says
he
my
ship
being
laid
up
will
furnish
me
with
a
very
good
excuse
for
coming
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
you
now
and
then
so
may
i
get
another
glimpse
of
my
own
dear
moll
and
see
her
in
the
fulness
of
her
joy
he
could
not
sufficiently
cry
up
the
excellence
of
godwin
his
noble
bearing
his
frank
honest
countenance
his
tenderness
for
moll
and
he
did
truly
shed
tears
of
gratitude
to
think
that
now
whatever
befell
him
her
welfare
and
happiness
were
assured
but
this
was
when
he
had
emptied
his
bottle
and
had
got
to
that
stage
of
emotion
which
usually
preceded
boisterous
hilarity
when
he
was
in
his
cups
and
whilst
i
am
speaking
of
bottles
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
note
here
for
my
future
warning
a
grave
imprudence
of
mine
which
i
discovered
on
leaving
the
room
to
seek
more
wine
on
the
flame
of
my
candle
blowing
aside
i
perceived
that
i
had
left
my
door
unfastened
so
that
it
now
stood
ajar
and
truly
this
was
as
culpable
a
piece
of
oversight
as
i
could
well
have
committed
for
here
had
an
enemy
or
even
an
idle
busybody
been
passing
he
might
very
well
have
entered
the
little
passage
and
overheard
that
which
had
been
our
undoing
to
have
made
known
chapter
xxvi
moll
dawson
was
married
to
richard
godwin
brief
account
of
attendant
dawson
left
us
this
morning
in
parting
godwin
graciously
begged
him
to
come
to
his
wedding
feast
on
christmas
day
they
having
fixed
upon
christmas
eve
to
be
married
and
dawson
promised
he
would
but
he
did
assure
me
afterwards
as
we
were
walking
along
the
road
to
meet
the
stage
waggon
that
he
would
certainly
feign
some
reason
for
not
coming
for
says
he
i
am
not
so
foolhardy
as
to
jeopardise
my
moll
happiness
for
the
pleasure
this
feast
would
give
me
nay
kit
i
do
think
break
my
heart
indeed
if
anything
of
my
doing
should
mar
my
moll
happiness
and
i
was
very
well
pleased
to
find
him
in
this
humour
promising
him
that
we
would
make
amends
for
his
abstinence
on
this
occasion
by
cracking
many
a
bottle
to
moll
joy
when
we
could
come
together
again
secretly
at
my
house
in
the
afternoon
pearson
clerk
brought
the
deed
of
agreement
for
the
settlement
of
the
estate
upon
moll
and
godwin
which
they
signed
and
so
that
is
finished
as
we
would
have
it
this
clerk
tells
me
his
master
hath
already
gone
to
london
about
getting
the
seal
so
all
things
look
mighty
prosperous
fearing
to
displease
sir
peter
lely
by
longer
delay
godwin
set
out
for
hatfield
tuesday
we
that
is
moll
don
sanchez
and
i
going
with
him
as
far
as
the
borough
where
moll
had
a
thousand
things
to
buy
against
her
wedding
and
here
we
found
great
activity
of
commerce
and
many
shops
filled
with
excellent
good
goods
more
than
ever
there
were
before
the
great
fire
drove
out
so
many
tradesmen
from
the
city
here
moll
spends
her
money
royally
buying
whatever
catches
her
eye
that
is
rich
and
beautiful
not
only
for
her
own
personal
adornment
but
for
the
embellishment
of
her
house
as
hangings
damasks
toys
etc
yet
always
with
a
consideration
of
godwin
taste
so
that
i
think
she
would
not
buy
a
pair
of
stockings
but
she
must
ask
herself
whether
he
would
admire
and
the
more
she
had
the
more
eager
she
grew
to
have
buying
by
which
was
an
imprudence
and
making
no
sort
of
bargain
but
giving
all
the
shopkeepers
asked
for
their
wares
which
to
be
sure
was
another
piece
of
recklessness
this
business
seemed
to
me
the
most
wearisome
in
the
world
but
it
served
only
to
increase
her
energies
and
she
would
not
be
persuaded
to
desist
until
the
shops
closing
she
could
lay
out
no
more
money
that
night
supped
very
well
but
mighty
late
at
the
tabard
inn
where
we
lay
all
night
and
the
next
morning
moll
fever
still
unabated
we
set
out
again
and
no
rest
until
we
caught
the
stage
and
that
by
a
miracle
at
four
and
so
home
dead
beat
moll
mad
all
day
because
the
carrier
hath
brought
but
half
her
purchases
and
they
not
what
she
wanted
by
the
evening
waggon
come
three
seamstresses
she
engaged
yesterday
morning
and
they
are
to
stay
in
the
house
till
all
is
finished
but
as
yet
nothing
for
them
to
do
which
is
less
grievous
to
them
than
to
poor
moll
who
i
believe
would
set
working
all
night
for
fear
she
shall
not
be
fitted
against
her
wedding
thank
god
the
carrier
brought
all
our
packages
this
morning
and
they
being
all
undone
and
laid
out
there
is
no
sitting
down
anywhere
with
comfort
but
all
confusion
and
no
regularity
anywhere
so
i
was
content
to
get
my
meals
in
the
kitchen
the
best
i
could
and
here
i
do
perceive
the
wisdom
of
don
sanchez
who
did
not
return
with
us
from
london
and
does
intend
he
told
me
to
stay
there
till
the
wedding
eve
moll
bit
by
a
new
maggot
tells
me
this
morning
she
will
have
a
great
feast
on
christmas
day
and
bids
me
order
matters
accordingly
she
will
have
a
whole
ox
roasted
before
the
house
by
midday
and
barrels
of
strong
ale
set
up
that
there
may
be
meat
and
drink
for
all
who
choose
to
take
it
and
at
four
she
will
have
a
supper
of
geese
turkeys
and
plum
puddings
for
all
her
tenants
their
wives
and
sweethearts
with
fiddles
afterwards
for
dancing
etc
lord
knows
how
we
shall
come
out
of
this
madness
but
i
have
got
the
innkeeper
a
busy
capable
man
to
help
me
and
he
does
assure
me
all
will
go
well
enough
and
i
pray
he
be
right
sick
with
fears
that
all
must
end
for
the
place
is
a
very
babel
for
tradesmen
and
workpeople
bringing
in
goods
and
knowing
not
where
to
set
them
servants
hurrying
this
way
and
that
one
charged
with
a
dozen
geese
another
with
silk
petticoats
jostling
each
other
laughing
quarrelling
and
no
sort
of
progress
as
it
seems
anywhere
but
all
tumult
and
disorder
could
not
sleep
a
wink
all
last
night
for
casting
up
accounts
of
all
this
feasting
and
finery
will
cost
us
and
finding
it
must
eat
up
all
that
money
we
had
of
poor
goodman
and
make
a
deep
hole
in
our
quarter
rents
besides
i
fell
a
speculating
whether
our
tenants
would
pay
me
with
the
same
punctuality
they
have
used
to
pay
old
simon
with
grievous
fears
to
the
contrary
for
assuredly
simon
hath
not
been
idle
these
past
days
and
will
do
us
an
ill
turn
if
he
can
by
throwing
doubts
before
these
same
tenants
whether
they
should
pay
or
not
before
moll
succession
is
made
sure
and
i
have
good
reason
to
fear
they
will
not
for
i
observed
yesterday
when
i
called
upon
farmer
giles
to
invite
him
to
our
feast
he
seemed
very
jerky
and
ill
at
ease
which
perplexed
me
greatly
until
on
quitting
i
perceived
through
a
door
that
stood
ajar
old
simon
seated
in
a
side
room
and
is
but
natural
that
if
they
find
prudent
excuse
for
withholding
their
rents
they
will
keep
their
money
in
pocket
which
will
pinch
us
smartly
when
our
bills
come
to
be
paid
yet
i
conceived
that
this
feast
would
incline
our
tenants
to
regard
us
kindly
but
on
the
other
hand
thinks
i
supposing
they
regard
this
as
a
snare
and
do
avoid
us
altogether
then
shall
we
be
nipped
another
way
for
having
no
one
to
eat
our
feast
but
a
few
idle
rogues
who
would
get
beef
and
ale
for
nothing
we
shall
but
lay
ourselves
open
to
mockery
and
get
further
into
discredit
thus
betwixt
one
fear
and
another
i
lay
like
a
toad
under
a
harrow
all
night
in
a
mortal
sweat
and
perturbation
of
spirit
nor
has
this
day
done
much
to
allay
my
apprehension
for
at
the
court
all
is
still
at
sixes
and
sevens
none
of
a
very
cheerful
spirit
but
all
mighty
anxious
save
moll
who
throughout
has
kept
a
high
bold
spirit
and
she
does
declare
they
will
work
all
night
but
everything
shall
be
in
its
place
before
her
lover
comes
and
truly
i
pray
they
may
but
do
think
they
will
not
for
such
a
mighty
business
as
this
should
have
been
begun
a
full
month
back
but
she
will
not
endure
me
in
the
house
though
god
knows
i
am
as
willing
as
any
to
help
saying
that
i
do
hinder
all
and
damp
their
spirit
for
work
with
my
gloomy
countenance
which
is
no
more
than
the
truth
i
fear
the
sky
very
overcast
with
wind
in
the
south
and
the
air
very
muggy
mild
and
close
so
that
i
do
apprehend
our
geese
will
be
all
stinking
before
they
are
eat
and
if
it
pour
of
rain
on
christmas
day
how
will
the
ox
be
roast
and
what
sort
of
company
can
we
expect
this
puts
me
to
another
taking
for
dread
of
a
new
fiasco
going
to
the
court
about
midday
i
was
dumbfounded
to
find
no
sign
of
the
disorder
that
prevailed
there
yesterday
but
all
swept
and
garnished
and
moll
in
a
brave
new
gown
seated
at
her
fireside
reading
a
book
with
the
utmost
tranquillity
though
i
suspect
she
did
assume
something
in
this
to
increase
my
astonishment
she
was
largely
diverted
by
my
amazement
and
made
very
light
of
her
achievement
but
she
admitted
that
all
had
worked
till
daybreak
and
she
had
slept
but
two
hours
since
nevertheless
no
one
could
have
looked
fresher
and
brighter
than
she
so
healthy
and
vigorous
are
her
natural
parts
about
one
comes
godwin
to
cap
her
happiness
and
give
fresh
glory
to
her
beauty
and
sure
a
handsomer
or
better
mated
couple
never
was
godwin
shapely
figure
being
now
set
off
to
advantage
by
a
very
noble
clothing
as
becoming
his
condition
with
him
came
also
by
the
morning
stage
don
sanchez
mighty
fine
in
a
new
head
of
the
latest
mode
and
a
figured
silk
coat
and
waistcoat
and
seeing
the
brave
show
they
made
at
table
i
was
much
humbled
to
think
i
had
gone
to
no
expense
in
this
particular
but
i
was
yet
more
mortified
when
don
sanchez
presents
moll
with
a
handsome
set
of
jewels
for
a
wedding
gift
to
see
that
i
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
offer
her
having
as
yet
taken
not
a
penny
of
her
money
save
for
the
use
of
others
and
my
bare
necessities
moll
however
was
too
full
of
happiness
to
note
this
omission
on
my
part
she
could
think
of
no
one
now
but
her
dear
husband
and
i
counted
for
nothing
however
this
little
chagrin
was
no
more
than
a
little
cloud
on
a
summer
day
which
harms
no
one
and
is
quickly
dispelled
by
generous
heat
and
the
tender
affection
of
these
two
for
each
other
did
impart
a
glow
of
happiness
to
my
heart
is
strange
to
think
how
all
things
look
bright
and
hopeful
which
yesterday
were
gloomy
and
awesome
even
the
weather
hath
changed
to
keep
in
harmony
with
our
condition
a
fresh
wind
sprang
up
from
the
north
this
morning
and
every
star
shines
out
sharp
and
clear
through
the
frosty
air
promising
well
for
and
our
christmas
feast
and
smelling
of
the
geese
i
do
now
find
them
all
as
sweet
as
nuts
which
contents
me
mightily
and
so
i
shall
go
to
bed
this
night
blessing
god
for
all
things
now
this
blessed
day
hath
ended
and
moll
is
sure
and
safely
bound
to
godwin
in
wedlock
thanks
to
providence
woke
at
daybreak
and
joyed
to
find
all
white
without
and
covered
with
rime
sparkling
like
diamonds
as
the
sun
rose
red
and
jolly
above
the
firs
and
so
i
thought
our
dear
moll
life
must
sparkle
as
she
looked
out
on
this
which
is
like
to
be
the
brightest
happiest
day
of
her
life
dressed
in
my
best
with
great
care
and
put
on
the
favour
of
white
ribbons
given
me
by
moll
woman
last
night
and
so
very
well
pleased
with
my
looks
to
the
court
where
moll
is
still
but
godwin
and
don
sanchez
nobly
arrayed
conversing
before
the
fire
and
here
a
great
bowpot
on
the
table
which
godwin
had
made
to
come
from
london
this
morning
of
the
most
wondrous
flowers
i
have
ever
seen
at
this
time
of
the
year
so
that
i
could
not
believe
them
real
at
first
but
they
are
indeed
living
and
godwin
tells
me
they
are
raised
in
houses
of
glass
very
artificially
heated
presently
comes
in
moll
with
her
maids
she
looking
like
any
pearl
in
a
shining
gown
of
white
satin
decked
with
rich
lace
the
collar
of
diamonds
glittering
about
her
white
throat
her
face
suffused
with
happy
blushes
and
past
everything
for
sprightly
beauty
godwin
offers
his
bowpot
and
takes
her
into
his
arms
and
there
for
a
moment
she
lay
with
closed
eyes
and
a
pallor
spreading
over
her
cheek
as
if
this
joy
were
more
than
her
heart
could
bear
but
recovering
quickly
she
was
again
all
lively
smiles
and
radiance
then
comes
a
letter
brought
by
the
night
carrier
from
her
father
a
most
dirty
scrawl
signed
robert
evans
with
his
mark
praying
he
may
be
excused
as
his
masts
are
to
be
stepped
o
wednesday
and
he
must
take
the
occasion
of
a
ketch
leaving
dartford
for
falmouth
this
day
and
at
the
same
time
begging
her
acceptance
of
a
canister
of
china
tea
which
is
i
learn
become
a
fashionable
dish
in
london
as
a
marriage
offering
soon
after
this
a
maid
runs
in
to
say
the
church
bells
are
so
out
we
go
into
the
crisp
fresh
air
with
not
a
damp
place
to
soil
moll
pretty
shoes
she
and
godwin
first
her
maids
next
carrying
her
train
and
the
don
and
i
closing
the
procession
very
stately
in
the
churchyard
stand
two
rows
of
village
maids
with
baskets
to
strew
rosemary
and
sweet
herbs
in
our
path
and
within
the
church
a
brave
show
of
gentlefolks
friends
and
neighbours
to
honour
the
wedding
but
here
was
i
put
to
a
most
horrid
quaking
the
moment
i
passed
the
door
to
perceive
old
simon
standing
foremost
in
the
throng
about
the
altar
in
his
leather
cap
which
he
would
not
remove
for
clerk
or
sexton
but
threatened
them
as
i
am
told
with
the
law
if
they
lay
a
finger
on
him
and
seeing
him
there
i
must
needs
conclude
that
he
intended
to
do
us
an
ill
turn
for
his
face
wore
the
most
wicked
cruel
malicious
look
that
ever
thirst
of
vengeance
could
impart
indeed
i
expected
nothing
less
than
that
he
would
forbid
the
marriage
on
such
grounds
as
we
had
too
good
reason
to
fear
and
with
this
dread
i
regarded
moll
who
also
could
not
fail
to
see
him
her
face
whitened
as
she
looked
at
him
but
her
step
never
faltered
and
this
peril
seemed
but
to
fortify
her
courage
and
resolution
and
indeed
i
do
think
by
her
high
bearing
and
the
defiance
in
her
eye
as
she
held
her
lover
arm
that
she
was
fully
prepared
to
make
good
answer
if
he
challenged
her
right
to
marry
godwin
but
the
lord
be
thanked
he
did
not
put
her
to
this
trial
only
he
stood
there
like
a
thing
of
evil
omen
to
mar
the
joy
of
this
day
with
fearful
foreboding
i
can
say
nothing
about
the
ceremony
for
all
my
attention
was
fixed
upon
this
hideous
simon
and
i
had
no
relief
until
was
safely
ended
and
moll
friends
pressed
forward
to
kiss
the
bride
and
offer
their
good
wishes
nor
did
i
feel
really
at
ease
until
we
were
back
again
at
the
court
and
seated
to
a
fine
dinner
with
all
the
friends
who
would
join
us
whereof
there
were
as
many
as
could
sit
comfortably
to
the
long
table
this
feast
was
very
joyous
and
merry
and
except
that
the
parson
would
be
facetious
over
his
bottle
nothing
unseemingly
or
immodest
was
said
so
we
stayed
at
table
in
exceeding
good
fellowship
till
the
candles
were
lit
and
then
the
parson
being
very
drunk
we
made
a
pretext
of
carrying
him
home
to
break
up
our
company
and
leave
the
happy
couple
to
their
joy
down
betimes
yesterday
morning
to
find
the
sky
still
clear
the
air
brisk
and
dry
and
ample
promise
of
a
fair
day
to
the
court
and
there
perceive
the
great
ox
spitted
on
a
stout
fir
pole
and
the
fire
just
kindling
john
the
gardener
setting
up
the
barrels
of
beer
and
a
famous
crowd
of
boys
and
beggars
already
standing
before
the
gates
and
there
they
might
have
stayed
till
their
dinner
was
cooked
ere
i
had
let
them
in
but
moll
coming
down
from
the
house
with
her
husband
and
seeing
this
shivering
crew
their
pinched
cheeks
yellow
and
their
noses
blue
with
cold
and
so
famished
with
hunger
they
could
scarce
find
strength
to
cry
god
bless
you
merry
gentlefolks
she
would
have
them
taste
at
once
some
of
that
happiness
with
which
her
heart
was
overflowing
and
so
did
with
her
own
hands
unbolt
the
gates
and
set
them
wide
bidding
the
halting
wretches
come
in
and
warm
themselves
not
content
with
this
she
sends
up
to
the
house
for
loaves
and
gives
every
one
a
hunch
of
bread
and
a
mug
of
ale
to
stay
his
empty
stomach
and
lord
was
a
pleasure
to
see
these
poor
folks
joy
how
they
spread
their
hands
out
to
the
flames
how
they
cockered
up
the
fire
here
and
there
to
brown
their
ox
equally
with
all
hands
now
and
then
to
turn
him
on
the
spit
how
they
would
set
their
bread
to
catch
the
dropping
gravy
and
how
they
would
lift
their
noses
to
catch
the
savoury
whiffs
that
came
from
the
roasting
beef
this
is
all
very
well
thinks
i
but
how
about
our
geese
and
turkeys
will
our
tenants
come
or
shall
we
find
that
simon
hath
spoilt
their
appetite
and
so
be
left
with
nought
but
starved
beggars
for
our
company
however
before
four
an
end
was
put
to
these
doubts
for
some
in
waggons
others
on
horse
with
their
wives
or
sweethearts
on
pillions
behind
clasping
their
men
tight
and
the
rest
afoot
all
came
that
were
asked
by
me
and
more
and
pretty
jolly
already
with
ale
on
the
road
and
a
great
store
of
mistletoe
amongst
them
for
their
further
merriment
and
what
pleased
me
as
much
as
anything
was
to
find
all
mighty
civil
to
moll
nearly
all
offering
her
a
christmas
box
of
fresh
eggs
honey
and
such
homely
produce
which
she
received
with
the
most
pretty
winning
grace
that
went
home
to
every
heart
so
that
the
hardest
faces
were
softened
with
a
glow
of
contentment
and
admiration
then
down
we
sat
to
table
moll
at
one
end
and
her
husband
beside
her
don
sanchez
and
i
at
and
all
the
rest
packed
as
close
as
sprats
in
a
barrel
but
every
lad
squeezing
closer
to
his
lass
to
make
room
for
his
neighbour
we
found
room
for
all
and
not
a
sour
look
anywhere
dear
heart
what
appetites
they
had
yet
would
waste
nothing
but
picked
every
one
his
bone
properly
clean
which
did
satisfy
me
nothing
was
amiss
with
our
geese
and
great
cheering
when
the
puddings
and
flapdragons
came
in
all
aflame
and
all
as
merry
as
grigs
flinging
of
lighted
plums
at
each
other
but
most
mannerly
not
to
fling
any
at
moll
or
us
then
more
shouting
for
joy
when
the
bowls
of
wassail
and
posset
come
in
and
all
standing
to
give
three
times
three
for
their
new
mistress
and
her
husband
hearing
of
which
the
beggars
without
now
tired
of
dancing
about
the
embers
troop
up
to
the
door
and
give
three
times
three
as
well
and
end
with
crying
joy
and
long
life
to
the
wedded
pair
when
this
tumult
was
ended
and
the
door
shut
godwin
gave
a
short
oration
thanking
our
tenants
for
their
company
and
good
wishes
and
then
he
told
them
how
his
dear
wife
and
he
wishing
others
to
share
their
joy
and
remember
this
day
had
resolved
to
forgive
every
tenant
of
his
quarter
rent
and
so
hopkins
says
he
addressing
me
you
will
think
of
this
at
first
i
was
disposed
to
begrudge
this
munificence
thinking
of
my
accounts
and
the
bills
i
should
have
to
pay
ere
rent
day
came
again
but
on
second
thoughts
it
rejoiced
me
much
as
being
a
counterblast
to
anything
simon
could
do
against
us
for
no
tenant
thinks
i
will
be
fool
enough
to
withold
payment
when
he
may
get
his
quittance
for
half
its
value
and
herein
was
i
not
mistaking
for
every
tenant
hath
paid
with
a
cheerful
countenance
so
that
this
is
very
good
business
and
i
am
not
in
any
way
astonished
to
find
that
our
subtle
spaniard
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
for
indeed
it
was
don
sanchez
who
knowing
my
fears
on
this
head
and
thinking
them
suggested
this
act
of
generosity
to
moll
which
she
in
her
fulness
of
heart
seized
on
at
once
truly
i
believe
she
would
give
the
clothes
off
her
back
no
matter
what
it
cost
her
to
any
one
in
need
so
reckless
is
she
in
love
and
pity
don
sanchez
took
leave
of
us
this
day
he
setting
forth
for
spain
with
the
hope
to
reach
his
friends
there
for
their
great
feast
of
the
new
year
and
we
are
all
mighty
sorry
to
lose
him
for
not
only
hath
he
been
a
rare
good
friend
to
us
but
also
he
is
a
most
seemly
gentleman
to
keep
us
in
countenance
and
a
very
good
staunch
and
reliable
companion
but
this
comprises
not
all
our
loss
he
having
as
i
confess
more
wit
in
his
little
finger
than
we
in
all
our
bodies
and
being
ever
ready
with
an
expedient
in
the
hour
of
need
and
i
know
not
why
but
i
look
on
his
going
as
a
sign
of
coming
evil
nor
am
i
greatly
comforted
by
his
telling
me
privily
that
when
we
want
him
he
shall
be
found
by
a
letter
sent
to
the
albego
puerto
del
sole
toledo
in
spain
and
i
pray
heaven
we
have
no
occasion
to
write
to
him
at
supper
i
find
moll
all
with
a
new
delight
by
reason
of
her
dear
husband
offering
to
take
her
to
london
for
a
month
to
visit
the
theatres
and
other
diversions
which
put
me
to
a
new
quirk
for
fear
moll
should
be
known
by
any
of
our
former
playhouse
companions
but
this
i
now
perceive
is
a
very
absurd
fear
for
no
one
in
the
world
who
had
seen
moll
three
years
ago
a
raw
child
could
recognise
her
now
a
beautiful
young
woman
in
her
fine
clothes
and
so
my
mind
is
at
ease
on
this
head
when
moll
was
retired
godwin
asked
if
i
could
let
him
have
a
few
hundreds
upon
his
account
and
i
answered
very
willingly
he
shall
and
now
setting
aside
enough
to
pay
all
bills
and
furnish
our
wants
till
next
quarter
day
i
am
resolved
to
give
him
every
farthing
left
of
the
rents
paid
yesterday
and
shall
be
most
hearty
glad
to
be
rid
of
it
for
this
money
do
seem
to
scar
my
hands
every
time
i
touch
it
nor
can
i
look
at
it
but
my
heart
is
wrung
with
pity
for
those
poor
tenants
who
paid
so
gleefully
yesterday
for
surely
their
quittances
will
hold
good
for
no
more
than
spoilt
paper
if
ever
our
roguery
is
discovered
this
day
moll
and
godwin
set
out
for
london
all
smiles
and
gladness
and
moll
did
make
me
promise
to
visit
them
there
and
share
their
pleasures
but
if
i
have
no
more
appetite
for
gaiety
than
i
feel
at
this
moment
i
shall
do
better
to
stay
here
and
mind
my
business
though
i
do
expect
to
find
little
pleasure
in
that
and
must
abide
by
a
month
of
very
dull
gloomy
days
chapter
xxvii
the
great
change
in
moll
and
the
likely
explanation
a
week
before
the
promised
month
was
up
moll
and
her
husband
came
back
to
the
court
and
lest
i
should
imagine
that
her
pleasures
had
been
curtailed
by
his
caprice
she
was
at
great
pains
to
convince
me
that
he
had
yielded
to
her
insistence
in
this
matter
declaring
she
was
sick
of
theatres
ridottos
masquerades
and
and
had
sighed
to
be
home
ere
she
had
been
in
london
a
week
this
surprised
me
exceedingly
knowing
how
passionate
fond
she
had
ever
been
of
the
playhouse
and
diversions
of
any
kind
and
remembering
how
eager
she
was
to
go
to
town
with
her
husband
and
i
perceived
there
was
more
significance
in
the
present
distaste
for
diversion
than
she
would
have
known
and
i
observed
further
when
the
joy
of
return
and
ordering
her
household
subsided
that
she
herself
had
changed
in
these
past
three
weeks
more
than
was
to
be
expected
in
so
short
a
time
for
though
she
seemed
to
love
her
husband
more
than
ever
she
had
loved
him
as
her
lover
and
could
not
be
happy
two
minutes
out
of
his
company
was
not
that
glad
joyous
love
of
the
earlier
days
but
a
yearning
clinging
passion
that
made
me
sad
to
see
for
i
could
not
look
upon
the
strained
anxious
tenderness
in
her
young
face
without
bethinking
me
of
my
poor
sister
as
she
knelt
praying
by
her
babe
cot
for
god
to
spare
its
frail
life
yet
her
husband
never
looked
more
hearty
and
strong
and
every
look
and
word
of
his
bespoke
increasing
love
the
change
in
her
was
not
unperceived
by
him
and
often
he
would
look
down
into
her
wistful
craving
eyes
as
if
he
would
ask
of
her
what
is
it
love
tell
me
all
and
she
as
understanding
this
appeal
would
answer
nothing
but
only
shake
her
head
still
gazing
into
his
kind
eyes
as
if
she
would
have
him
believe
she
had
nought
to
tell
these
things
made
me
very
thoughtful
and
urgent
to
find
some
satisfactory
explanation
to
be
sure
thinks
i
marriage
is
but
the
beginning
of
a
woman
real
life
and
so
one
may
not
reasonably
expect
her
to
be
what
she
was
as
a
thoughtless
child
and
is
no
less
natural
that
a
young
wife
should
love
to
be
alone
with
her
husband
rather
than
in
the
midst
of
people
who
must
distract
his
thoughts
from
her
as
also
it
is
right
and
proper
she
should
wish
to
be
in
her
own
home
directing
her
domestic
affairs
and
tending
to
her
husband
showing
him
withal
she
is
a
good
and
thoughtful
housewife
but
why
these
pensive
tristful
looks
now
she
hath
her
heart
desire
then
finding
i
must
seek
some
better
explanation
of
her
case
i
bethought
me
she
must
have
had
a
very
hard
difficult
task
in
london
to
conceal
from
one
who
was
now
a
part
of
herself
her
knowledge
of
so
many
things
it
was
unbefitting
she
should
reveal
at
the
playhouse
she
must
feign
astonishment
at
all
she
saw
as
having
never
visited
one
before
and
keep
constant
guard
upon
herself
lest
some
word
slipped
her
lips
to
reveal
her
acquaintance
with
the
players
and
their
art
at
the
ridotto
she
must
equally
feign
ignorance
of
modish
dancing
she
whose
nimble
feet
had
tripped
to
every
measure
since
she
could
stand
alone
there
was
scarcely
a
subject
on
which
she
would
dare
to
speak
without
deliberation
and
she
must
check
her
old
habit
of
singing
and
be
silent
lest
she
fall
by
hazard
to
humming
some
known
tune
truly
under
such
continuous
strain
which
none
but
such
a
trained
actress
could
maintain
for
a
single
day
her
spirit
must
have
wearied
and
if
this
part
was
hard
to
play
in
public
where
we
are
all
i
take
it
actors
of
some
sort
and
on
the
alert
to
sustain
the
character
we
would
have
our
own
how
much
more
difficult
must
it
be
in
private
when
we
drop
our
disguise
and
lay
our
hearts
open
to
those
we
love
and
here
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
did
hit
rightly
at
the
true
cause
of
her
present
secret
distress
for
at
home
as
abroad
she
must
still
be
acting
a
part
weighing
her
words
guarding
her
acts
for
ever
to
be
hiding
of
something
from
her
dearest
friend
ever
denying
him
that
confidence
he
appealed
for
ever
keeping
a
cruel
biting
bond
upon
the
most
generous
impulse
of
her
heart
closing
that
heart
when
it
was
bursting
to
open
to
her
dear
mate
soon
after
their
return
godwin
set
to
work
painting
the
head
of
a
sybil
which
the
lord
of
hatfield
house
had
commanded
on
the
recommendation
of
sir
peter
lely
taking
anne
fitch
for
his
model
and
she
sitting
in
that
room
of
the
court
house
he
had
prepared
for
his
workshop
here
he
would
be
at
it
every
day
as
long
as
there
was
light
for
his
purpose
moll
near
at
hand
watching
him
ready
to
chat
or
hold
her
peace
according
to
his
inclination
just
as
she
had
done
when
he
was
of
the
ceiling
only
that
now
her
regard
was
more
intent
upon
him
than
his
work
and
when
he
turned
to
look
at
her
was
with
interchange
of
undisguised
love
in
their
fond
eyes
she
ever
had
a
piece
of
work
or
a
book
in
her
lap
but
she
made
not
half
a
dozen
stitches
or
turned
a
single
page
in
the
whole
day
for
he
was
the
sole
occupation
of
her
mind
the
living
book
ever
yielding
her
sweet
thoughts
this
persevering
patient
toil
on
his
part
did
at
first
engender
in
my
mind
suspicion
that
some
doubting
thoughts
urged
him
to
assume
his
independence
against
any
accident
that
might
befall
the
estate
but
now
i
believe
was
nothing
but
a
love
of
work
and
of
his
art
and
that
his
mind
was
free
from
any
taint
of
misgiving
as
regards
his
honesty
is
likely
enough
that
spite
her
caution
many
a
word
and
sign
escaped
moll
which
an
enemy
would
have
quickly
seized
on
to
prove
her
culpable
but
we
do
never
see
the
faults
of
those
we
love
or
seeing
them
have
ready
at
a
moment
excuse
to
prove
them
no
faults
at
all
and
at
this
time
godwin
heart
was
so
full
of
love
there
was
no
place
for
other
feeling
venom
from
a
rose
had
seemed
to
him
more
possible
than
evil
from
one
so
natural
sweet
and
beautiful
as
moll
chapter
xxviii
plays
us
a
mad
prank
for
the
last
time
in
her
about
once
in
a
fortnight
i
contrived
to
go
to
london
for
a
couple
of
days
on
some
pretext
of
business
and
best
part
of
this
time
i
spent
with
dawson
and
the
first
visit
i
paid
him
after
the
return
of
moll
and
her
husband
telling
him
of
their
complete
happiness
moll
increasing
womanly
beauty
and
the
prosperous
aspect
of
our
affairs
for
i
had
that
day
positive
assurance
our
seal
would
be
obtained
within
a
month
i
concluded
by
asking
if
his
mast
might
not
now
be
stepped
and
he
be
in
a
position
to
come
to
chislehurst
and
see
her
as
he
had
before
no
kit
thanking
ye
kindly
says
he
after
fighting
it
out
with
himself
in
silence
a
minute
or
two
better
not
i
am
getting
in
a
manner
used
to
this
solitude
and
bar
two
or
three
days
a
week
when
i
feel
a
bit
hangdog
and
hipped
there
not
much
in
this
world
for
an
old
fellow
to
live
for
when
he
lost
his
child
i
am
pretty
well
content
it
would
only
undo
me
if
you
had
a
child
your
own
flesh
and
blood
part
of
your
life
a
child
that
had
been
to
you
what
my
sweet
moll
hath
been
to
me
you
would
comprehend
better
how
i
feel
to
pretend
indifference
when
you
longing
to
hug
her
to
your
heart
to
talk
of
fair
weather
and
foul
when
you
thinking
of
old
times
and
then
to
bow
and
scrape
and
go
away
without
a
single
desire
of
your
aching
heart
satisfied
is
more
than
a
man
with
a
spark
of
warmth
in
his
soul
can
bear
and
then
he
proceeded
to
give
a
dozen
other
reasons
for
declining
the
tempting
bait
the
sum
of
all
proving
to
my
conviction
that
he
was
dying
to
see
moll
and
i
feared
he
would
soon
be
doing
by
stealth
that
which
it
were
much
safer
he
should
do
openly
about
a
week
after
this
i
got
a
letter
from
him
asking
me
to
come
again
as
soon
as
i
might
he
having
cut
his
hand
with
a
chisel
so
that
i
can
not
work
my
lathe
and
having
nothing
to
occupy
my
mind
do
plague
myself
beyond
endurance
much
concerned
for
my
old
friend
i
lose
no
time
in
repairing
to
greenwich
where
i
find
him
sitting
idle
before
his
lathe
with
an
arm
hanging
in
a
handkerchief
and
his
face
very
yellow
but
this
i
think
was
of
drinking
too
much
ale
and
here
he
fell
speedily
discoursing
of
moll
saying
he
could
not
sleep
of
nights
for
thinking
of
the
pranks
she
used
to
play
us
our
merry
vagabond
life
together
in
spain
ere
we
got
to
elche
and
how
he
missed
her
now
more
than
ever
he
did
before
after
that
as
i
anticipated
he
came
in
a
shuffling
roundabout
way
as
one
ashamed
to
own
his
weakness
to
hinting
at
seeing
moll
by
stealth
declaring
he
would
rather
see
her
for
two
minutes
now
and
again
peering
through
a
bush
though
she
should
never
cast
a
glance
his
way
than
have
her
treat
him
as
if
she
were
not
his
child
and
ceased
to
feel
any
love
for
him
but
seeing
the
peril
of
such
ways
i
would
by
no
means
consent
to
his
hanging
about
the
court
like
a
thief
and
told
him
plainly
that
unless
he
would
undo
us
all
and
ruin
moll
he
must
come
openly
as
before
or
not
at
all
without
further
demur
he
consents
to
be
guided
by
me
and
then
very
eagerly
asks
when
it
will
be
proper
for
him
to
come
and
we
agree
that
if
he
come
in
a
week
time
there
will
be
no
thought
in
anybody
mind
of
our
having
conspired
to
this
end
as
the
fates
would
have
it
godwin
finished
his
painting
on
the
saturday
following
the
most
wonderful
piece
of
its
kind
i
ever
saw
or
any
one
else
in
my
belief
and
being
justly
proud
of
his
work
and
anxious
sir
peter
lely
should
see
it
soon
he
resolved
he
would
carry
it
to
hatfield
on
monday
moll
who
was
prouder
of
her
husband
piece
than
if
it
were
of
her
own
doing
was
not
less
eager
it
should
be
seen
yet
the
thought
that
she
must
lose
him
for
four
days
for
this
journey
could
not
well
be
accomplished
in
less
time
cast
down
her
spirits
exceedingly
was
painful
to
see
her
efforts
to
be
cheerful
despite
of
herself
and
seeing
how
incapable
she
was
of
concealing
her
real
feeling
from
him
whom
she
would
cheer
she
at
length
confessed
to
him
her
trouble
i
would
have
you
go
and
yet
i
have
you
stay
love
says
she
is
but
a
little
while
we
shall
be
parted
says
he
a
little
while
says
she
trembling
and
wringing
one
hand
within
the
other
it
seems
to
me
as
if
we
were
parting
for
ever
why
then
returns
he
laughing
we
will
not
part
at
all
you
shall
come
with
me
chuck
what
should
prevent
you
she
starts
with
joy
at
this
then
looks
at
him
incredulous
for
a
moment
and
so
her
countenance
falling
again
she
shakes
her
head
as
thinking
i
take
it
that
if
it
were
advisable
she
should
go
with
him
he
would
have
proposed
it
before
no
says
she
was
an
idle
fancy
and
i
not
yield
to
it
i
shall
become
a
burden
rather
than
a
helpmate
if
you
can
not
stir
from
home
without
me
nay
adds
she
when
he
would
override
this
objection
you
must
not
tempt
me
to
be
weak
but
rather
aid
me
to
do
that
which
i
feel
right
and
she
would
not
be
persuaded
from
this
resolution
but
bore
herself
most
bravely
even
to
the
moment
when
she
and
her
husband
clasped
each
for
the
last
time
in
a
farewell
embrace
she
stood
where
he
had
left
her
for
some
moments
after
he
was
gone
suddenly
she
ran
a
few
paces
with
parted
lips
and
outstretched
hands
as
if
she
would
call
him
back
then
as
sharply
she
halts
clasping
her
hands
and
so
presently
turns
back
looking
across
her
shoulder
with
such
terror
in
her
white
face
that
i
do
think
her
strong
imagination
figured
some
accusing
spirits
threatening
the
end
of
all
her
joys
i
followed
her
into
the
house
but
there
i
learnt
from
butterby
that
her
mistress
was
gone
to
her
own
chamber
as
i
was
sitting
in
my
office
in
the
afternoon
jack
dawson
came
to
me
in
his
seaman
dress
his
hand
still
wrapped
up
but
his
face
more
healthful
for
his
long
ride
and
cheerful
thoughts
why
this
could
not
have
fallen
out
better
says
i
when
we
had
exchanged
greetings
for
moll
is
all
alone
and
down
in
the
dumps
by
reason
of
her
husband
having
left
her
this
morning
on
business
that
will
hold
him
absent
for
three
or
four
days
we
will
go
up
presently
and
have
supper
with
her
no
kit
says
he
very
resolutely
i
not
i
am
resolved
i
wo
go
there
till
for
this
is
no
hour
to
be
on
ladies
and
her
husband
being
away
look
as
if
we
had
ordered
it
of
purpose
besides
if
moll
in
trouble
how
am
i
to
pretend
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
and
care
less
and
this
mother
butterby
and
a
parcel
of
sly
observant
servants
about
to
surprise
one
at
any
moment
say
no
more
is
useless
for
i
wo
be
persuaded
against
my
judgment
as
you
will
says
i
there
another
reason
if
other
needed
says
he
and
that
this
plaguey
thirst
of
mine
which
seizes
me
when
i
doleful
or
joyful
with
a
force
there
no
resisting
and
chiefly
it
seizes
me
in
the
later
part
of
the
day
therefore
i
have
you
take
me
to
the
court
morning
betimes
ere
it
at
its
worst
my
throat
like
any
limekiln
for
dryness
now
so
do
pray
kit
fasten
the
door
snug
and
give
me
a
mug
of
ale
this
ended
our
discussion
but
as
it
was
necessary
i
should
give
some
reason
for
not
supping
with
moll
i
left
dawson
with
a
bottle
and
went
up
to
the
house
to
find
moll
there
i
learnt
that
she
was
still
in
her
chamber
and
sleeping
as
butterby
believed
so
i
bade
the
good
woman
tell
her
mistress
when
she
awoke
that
captain
evans
had
come
to
spend
the
night
with
me
and
he
would
call
to
pay
her
his
devoirs
the
next
morning
here
that
nothing
may
be
unaccounted
for
in
the
sequence
of
events
i
must
depart
from
my
train
of
present
observation
to
speak
from
i
have
said
that
when
moll
started
forward
as
if
to
overtake
her
husband
she
suddenly
stopped
as
if
confronted
by
some
menacing
spectre
and
this
indeed
was
the
case
for
at
that
moment
there
appeared
to
her
heated
imagination
for
no
living
soul
was
there
a
little
bent
old
woman
clothed
in
a
single
white
garment
of
moorish
fashion
and
moll
knew
that
she
was
godwin
though
seeing
her
now
for
the
first
time
come
from
barbary
to
claim
her
own
and
separate
moll
from
the
husband
she
had
won
by
fraud
she
stood
there
says
moll
within
her
gates
with
raised
hand
and
a
most
bitter
unforgiving
look
upon
her
wasted
face
barring
the
way
by
which
moll
might
regain
her
husband
and
as
the
poor
wife
halted
trembling
in
dreadful
awe
the
old
woman
advanced
with
the
sure
foot
of
right
and
justice
what
reproach
she
had
to
make
what
malediction
to
pronounce
moll
dared
not
stay
to
hear
but
turning
her
back
fled
to
the
house
where
gaining
her
chamber
she
locked
the
door
and
flung
herself
upon
her
husband
bed
and
in
this
last
dear
refuge
shutting
her
eyes
clasping
her
ears
as
if
by
dulling
her
senses
to
escape
the
phantom
she
lay
in
a
convulsion
of
terror
for
the
mere
dread
that
such
a
thing
might
be
then
at
the
thought
that
she
might
never
again
be
enfolded
here
in
her
husband
arms
an
agony
of
grief
succeeded
her
fit
of
maddening
fear
and
she
wept
till
her
mind
grew
calm
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
so
little
by
little
as
her
courage
revived
she
began
to
reason
with
herself
as
how
was
the
least
likely
thing
in
the
world
that
if
godwin
were
in
england
she
should
come
to
the
court
unattended
and
in
her
moorish
clothes
and
then
seeing
the
folly
of
abandoning
herself
to
a
foolish
fancy
she
rose
washed
the
tears
from
her
face
and
set
herself
to
find
some
occupation
to
distract
her
thoughts
and
what
employment
is
nearer
to
her
thoughts
or
dearer
to
her
heart
than
making
things
straight
for
her
husband
so
she
goes
into
the
next
room
where
he
worked
and
falls
to
washing
his
brushes
cleaning
his
and
putting
all
things
in
order
against
his
return
that
he
may
lose
no
time
in
setting
to
work
at
another
picture
and
at
dinner
time
finding
her
face
still
disfigured
with
her
late
emotions
and
ashamed
of
her
late
folly
she
bids
her
maid
bring
a
snack
to
her
room
under
the
pretence
that
she
feels
unwell
this
meal
she
eats
still
working
in
her
husband
room
for
one
improvement
prompting
another
she
finds
plenty
to
do
there
now
bethinking
her
that
the
hangings
of
her
own
private
room
being
handsomer
will
look
better
on
these
walls
whereas
are
more
fit
for
hers
where
they
are
less
seen
that
this
corner
looks
naked
and
will
look
better
for
her
little
french
table
standing
there
with
a
china
image
atop
and
so
forth
thus
then
did
she
devote
her
time
till
sundown
whereabouts
butterby
raps
at
her
door
to
know
if
she
will
have
a
cup
of
warm
caudle
to
comfort
her
at
the
same
time
telling
her
that
hopkins
will
not
sup
with
her
as
he
has
captain
evans
for
his
guest
at
the
lodge
and
now
moll
by
that
natural
succession
of
extremes
which
seems
to
be
a
governing
law
of
nature
as
the
flow
the
ebb
the
calm
the
storm
day
the
night
etc
was
not
less
elated
than
she
had
been
depressed
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
but
still
i
take
it
in
a
nervous
excitable
condition
and
hearing
her
father
whom
she
has
not
seen
so
long
is
here
a
thousand
mad
projects
enter
her
lively
imagination
so
when
butterby
after
the
refusal
of
her
warm
caudle
proposes
she
shall
bring
madam
a
tray
of
victuals
that
she
may
pick
something
in
bed
moll
stifling
a
merry
thought
asks
in
a
feeble
voice
what
there
is
in
the
larder
why
madam
says
butterby
from
the
outside
there
the
partridges
you
did
not
eat
at
breakfast
there
a
cold
pigeon
pasty
and
a
nice
fresh
ham
and
a
lovely
hasty
pudding
i
made
with
my
own
hands
in
the
pot
bring
all
says
moll
in
the
same
aching
voice
and
i
pick
what
tempts
me
therewith
she
silently
slips
the
bolt
back
whips
on
her
nightgown
and
whips
into
bed
presently
up
comes
butterby
carrying
a
wax
candle
followed
by
a
couple
of
maids
charged
with
all
the
provisions
moll
had
commanded
having
permission
to
enter
the
good
woman
sets
down
her
candle
puts
on
her
glasses
and
coming
to
the
bedside
says
she
can
see
very
well
by
her
poor
looks
that
her
dear
mistress
has
got
a
disorder
of
the
biliaries
on
her
and
prays
heaven
it
may
not
turn
to
something
worse
nay
says
moll
very
faintly
i
shall
be
well
again
when
i
am
relieved
of
this
headache
and
if
i
can
only
fall
asleep
as
i
feel
disposed
to
you
will
see
me
morning
in
my
usual
health
i
sha
attempt
to
rise
this
evening
for
mercy
sake
do
cries
butterby
and
so
i
pray
you
order
that
no
one
shall
come
near
my
room
to
disturb
me
i
see
that
no
one
so
much
as
sets
a
foot
on
your
stair
madam
poor
dear
says
and
you
will
see
that
all
is
closed
carefully
and
so
mother
and
to
you
jane
and
betsy
oh
my
poor
head
with
a
whispered
dear
madam
butterby
and
the
maids
leave
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
them
as
if
of
gingerbread
and
no
sooner
are
they
gone
than
moll
big
with
her
mad
design
nips
out
of
bed
strips
off
her
nightgown
and
finding
nothing
more
convenient
for
her
purpose
puts
the
ham
pasty
and
partridges
in
a
clean
this
done
she
puts
on
her
cloak
and
hood
and
having
with
great
caution
set
the
door
open
and
seen
all
safe
and
quiet
below
she
takes
up
her
bag
of
victuals
blows
out
the
candle
and
as
silent
as
any
mouse
makes
her
way
to
the
little
private
staircase
at
the
end
of
the
stairs
and
now
with
less
fear
of
encountering
godwin
than
black
bogey
she
feels
her
way
down
the
dark
narrow
staircase
reaches
the
lower
door
unbolts
it
and
steps
out
on
the
path
at
the
back
of
the
house
there
is
still
a
faint
twilight
and
this
enables
her
to
find
her
way
to
the
wicket
gate
opposite
anne
fitch
cottage
not
a
soul
is
to
be
seen
and
so
with
her
hood
drawn
well
over
her
head
she
speeds
on
and
in
five
minutes
reaches
my
house
here
finding
the
door
fastened
she
gives
a
couple
of
knocks
and
on
my
opening
she
asks
meekly
in
a
feigned
voice
which
for
the
life
of
me
i
should
not
have
known
for
hers
if
i
am
minded
to
buy
a
couple
of
partridges
a
friend
has
sent
and
she
has
no
use
for
partridges
cries
dawson
from
within
have
kit
for
your
bread
and
cheese
is
mighty
fare
let
me
see
good
woman
says
i
yes
sir
answers
she
meekly
putting
her
in
my
hand
which
perplexed
me
vastly
by
its
weight
and
bulk
they
seem
to
be
pretty
big
birds
by
the
feel
of
says
i
you
can
come
in
and
shut
the
door
after
you
moll
shuts
the
door
and
shoots
the
bolt
then
tripping
behind
me
into
the
light
she
casts
back
her
hood
and
flings
her
arms
round
her
neck
with
a
peal
of
joyful
laughter
what
cries
i
why
what
can
have
brought
you
here
why
i
knew
you
have
nothing
to
give
my
poor
old
dad
but
mouldy
cheese
so
i
brought
you
a
brace
of
partridges
if
you
please
sir
says
she
concluding
in
her
feigned
voice
as
she
emptied
the
ham
pasty
and
partridges
all
out
of
the
slip
on
to
the
table
but
godwin
says
i
in
alarm
oh
call
me
moll
cries
she
wildly
let
me
be
myself
for
this
one
night
chapter
xxix
the
subtile
means
whereby
simon
leads
godwin
to
doubt
his
again
must
i
draw
upon
matter
of
to
show
you
how
all
things
came
to
pass
on
this
fatal
night
when
godwin
reached
london
he
went
to
sir
peter
lely
house
in
lincoln
inn
to
know
if
he
was
still
at
hatfield
and
there
learning
he
was
gone
hence
to
hampton
and
no
one
answering
for
certainty
when
he
would
return
godwin
seeing
that
he
might
linger
in
london
for
days
to
no
purpose
and
bethinking
him
how
pale
and
sorrowful
his
dear
wife
was
when
they
parted
concludes
to
leave
his
picture
at
sir
peter
and
post
back
to
chislehurst
counting
to
give
his
wife
a
happy
surprise
about
eight
he
reaches
the
court
to
find
all
shut
and
barred
by
the
prudent
housekeeper
who
on
letting
him
in
with
many
exclamations
of
joy
and
wonder
falls
presently
to
sighing
and
shaking
her
head
as
she
tells
how
her
mistress
has
lain
abed
since
dinner
and
is
sick
of
the
biliaries
in
great
concern
godwin
takes
the
candle
from
butterby
hand
and
hastes
up
to
his
wife
room
opening
the
door
softly
he
enters
to
find
the
bed
tumbled
indeed
but
empty
he
calls
her
in
a
soft
voice
going
into
the
next
room
and
getting
no
reply
nor
finding
her
there
he
calls
again
more
loudly
and
there
is
no
response
then
as
he
stands
irresolute
and
amazed
he
hears
a
knock
at
the
door
below
and
concluding
that
is
his
wife
who
has
had
occasion
to
go
out
seeking
fresh
air
for
her
comfort
maybe
he
runs
swiftly
down
and
opens
ere
a
servant
can
answer
the
call
and
there
he
is
faced
not
by
sweet
moll
but
the
jaundiced
wicked
old
simon
gasping
and
panting
for
breath
dost
thee
know
says
he
fetching
his
breath
at
every
other
word
dost
thee
know
where
the
woman
thy
wife
is
where
is
she
cries
godwin
in
quick
alarm
thinking
by
this
fellow
sweating
haste
that
some
accident
had
befallen
his
dear
wife
i
will
show
thee
where
she
is
aye
and
what
she
is
gasps
the
old
man
and
then
clasping
his
hands
he
adds
verily
the
lord
hath
heard
my
prayers
and
delivered
mine
enemies
into
my
hand
godwin
who
had
stepped
aside
to
catch
up
his
hat
from
the
table
where
he
had
flung
it
on
entering
stopped
short
hearing
this
fervent
note
of
praise
and
turning
about
with
misgivings
of
simon
purpose
cries
what
are
your
enemies
to
me
everything
cries
simon
mine
enemies
are
thine
for
as
they
have
cheated
me
so
have
they
cheated
thee
enough
of
this
cries
godwin
tell
me
where
my
wife
is
and
be
done
with
it
i
say
i
will
show
thee
where
she
is
and
what
she
is
tell
me
where
she
is
cries
godwin
with
passion
that
is
my
secret
and
too
precious
to
throw
away
i
comprehend
you
now
says
godwin
bethinking
him
of
the
greed
you
shall
be
paid
tell
me
where
she
is
and
name
your
price
the
price
is
this
returns
the
other
thy
promise
to
be
secret
to
catch
them
in
this
trap
and
give
no
opening
for
escape
oh
i
know
them
they
are
as
serpents
that
slip
through
a
man
fingers
and
turn
to
bite
they
shall
not
serve
me
so
again
promise
nothing
think
you
i
of
your
own
base
kind
to
deal
with
you
in
treachery
you
had
my
answer
before
when
you
would
poison
my
mind
rascal
but
adds
he
with
fury
you
shall
tell
me
where
my
wife
is
i
would
tear
the
tongue
from
my
throat
ere
it
should
undo
the
work
of
providence
if
they
escape
the
present
vengeance
of
heaven
thee
shalt
answer
for
it
not
i
yet
i
will
give
thee
a
clue
to
find
this
woman
who
hath
fooled
thee
seek
her
where
there
are
thieves
and
drunkards
to
mock
at
thy
simplicity
to
jeer
at
their
easy
gull
for
i
say
again
thy
wife
never
was
in
barbary
but
playing
the
farded
wanton
the
patience
with
which
godwin
had
harkened
to
this
tirade
doubting
by
his
passion
that
simon
was
stark
mad
gave
way
before
this
vile
aspersion
on
his
wife
and
clutching
the
old
man
by
the
throat
he
flung
him
across
the
threshold
and
shut
the
door
upon
him
but
where
was
his
wife
that
question
was
still
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
his
sole
misgiving
was
that
accident
had
befallen
her
and
that
somewhere
in
the
house
he
should
find
her
lying
cold
and
insensible
with
this
terror
in
his
mind
he
ran
again
upstairs
on
the
landing
he
was
met
by
butterby
who
prudent
soul
at
the
first
hint
of
misconduct
on
her
mistress
part
had
bundled
the
gaping
servants
up
to
their
rooms
mercy
on
us
dear
master
says
she
where
can
our
dear
lady
be
for
a
surety
she
hath
not
left
the
house
for
i
locked
all
up
as
she
bade
me
when
we
carried
up
her
supper
and
had
the
key
in
my
pocket
when
you
knocked
the
house
safe
says
she
poor
soul
with
a
voice
could
scarce
be
heared
let
no
one
disturb
me
for
i
do
feel
most
heavy
with
sleep
godwin
passed
into
his
wife
room
and
then
into
the
next
looking
about
him
in
distraction
lord
here
the
sweet
thing
nightgown
exclaims
butterby
from
the
next
room
whither
she
had
followed
godwin
but
dear
heart
me
where
the
ham
gone
godwin
entering
from
the
next
room
looked
at
her
as
doubting
whether
he
or
all
the
world
had
taken
leave
of
their
wits
and
the
pigeon
pasty
added
butterby
regarding
the
table
laid
out
beside
her
mistress
bed
and
the
cold
partridge
adds
she
in
redoubled
astonishment
why
here
nought
left
but
my
pudding
and
that
as
cold
as
a
stone
godwin
with
the
candle
flaring
in
his
hand
passed
hastily
by
her
too
wrought
by
fear
to
regard
either
the
ludicrous
or
incomprehensible
side
of
butterby
consternation
and
so
going
down
the
corridor
away
from
the
stairs
he
comes
to
the
door
of
the
little
back
stairs
standing
wide
open
and
seeming
to
bid
him
descend
he
goes
quickly
down
yet
trembling
with
fear
that
he
may
find
her
at
the
bottom
broken
by
a
fall
but
all
he
discovers
is
the
bolt
drawn
and
the
door
ajar
as
he
pushes
it
open
a
gust
of
wind
blows
out
the
light
and
here
he
stood
in
the
darkness
eager
to
be
doing
yet
knowing
not
which
way
to
turn
or
how
to
act
clearly
his
wife
had
gone
out
by
this
door
and
so
far
this
gave
support
to
simon
statement
that
he
knew
where
she
was
and
with
this
a
flame
was
kindled
within
him
that
seemed
to
sear
his
very
soul
if
simon
spoke
truth
in
one
particular
why
should
he
lie
in
others
why
had
his
wife
refused
to
go
with
him
to
hatfield
why
had
she
bid
no
one
come
near
her
room
why
had
she
gone
forth
by
this
secret
stair
alone
then
cursing
himself
for
the
unnamed
suspicion
that
could
thus
though
but
for
a
moment
disfigure
the
fair
image
that
he
worshipped
he
asked
himself
why
his
wife
should
not
be
free
to
follow
a
caprice
but
where
was
she
ever
that
question
surged
upwards
in
the
tumult
of
his
thoughts
where
should
he
seek
her
suddenly
it
struck
him
that
i
might
help
him
to
find
her
and
acting
instantly
upon
this
hope
he
made
his
way
in
breathless
haste
to
the
road
and
so
towards
my
lodge
ere
he
has
gone
a
hundred
yards
simon
steps
out
of
the
shadow
and
stands
before
him
like
a
shade
in
the
dimness
i
crave
thy
pardon
master
says
he
humbly
i
spoke
like
a
fool
in
my
passion
if
you
will
have
my
pardon
tell
me
where
to
find
my
wife
if
not
stand
aside
answers
godwin
wilt
thee
hear
me
speak
for
two
minutes
if
i
promise
to
tell
thee
where
she
is
and
suffer
thee
to
find
her
how
thee
willst
save
thee
time
speak
says
godwin
thy
wife
is
there
says
simon
under
his
breath
pointing
towards
my
house
she
is
revelling
with
hopkins
and
captain
evans
men
that
she
did
tramp
the
country
with
as
vagabond
players
ere
the
spaniard
taught
them
more
profitable
wickedness
knock
at
the
door
which
thee
mayst
be
sure
is
fast
and
while
one
holds
thee
in
parley
the
rest
will
set
the
room
in
order
and
find
a
plausible
tale
to
hoodwink
thee
afresh
be
guided
by
me
and
thee
shalt
enter
the
house
unknown
to
them
as
i
did
an
hour
since
and
there
thee
shalt
know
of
thine
own
senses
how
thy
wife
doth
profit
by
thy
blindness
if
this
truth
be
not
proved
if
thee
canst
then
say
that
i
have
lied
from
malice
envy
and
evil
purpose
this
knife
says
he
showing
a
blade
in
his
hand
this
knife
will
i
thrust
into
my
own
heart
though
i
stand
the
next
instant
before
the
eternal
judge
my
hands
wet
with
my
own
blood
to
answer
for
my
crime
have
you
finished
asks
godwin
no
not
yet
i
hold
thee
to
thy
promise
returns
simon
with
eager
haste
why
do
men
lie
for
their
own
profit
what
profit
have
i
in
lying
when
i
pray
thee
to
put
my
word
to
the
proof
and
not
take
it
on
trust
with
the
certainty
of
punishment
even
if
the
proof
be
doubtful
thee
believest
this
woman
is
what
she
pretends
to
be
what
does
that
show
your
simplicity
not
hers
how
would
women
trick
their
husbands
without
such
skill
to
blind
them
by
a
pretence
of
love
and
virtue
say
no
more
cries
godwin
hoarsely
or
i
may
strangle
you
before
you
pass
trial
go
your
devilish
way
i
follow
now
god
be
praised
for
this
cries
simon
softly
softly
adds
he
creeping
in
the
shade
of
the
bank
towards
the
house
but
ere
he
has
gone
a
dozen
paces
godwin
repents
him
again
with
shame
in
his
heart
and
stopping
says
i
go
no
further
then
thee
doubtest
my
word
no
longer
whispers
simon
quickly
is
fear
that
makest
thee
halt
the
fear
of
finding
thy
wife
a
wanton
and
a
trickster
no
no
by
god
if
that
be
so
then
art
thee
bound
to
prove
her
innocent
that
i
may
not
say
to
all
the
world
thee
mightest
have
put
her
honour
to
the
test
and
dared
not
choosing
rather
to
cheat
thyself
and
be
cheated
by
her
than
know
thyself
dishonoured
if
thee
dost
truly
love
this
woman
and
believe
her
guiltless
then
for
her
honour
must
thee
put
me
not
her
to
this
trial
no
madman
could
reason
like
this
says
godwin
i
accept
this
trial
and
heaven
forgive
me
if
i
do
wrong

and
utterly
what
cries
dawson
catching
his
daughter
in
his
arms
and
hugging
her
to
his
breast
when
the
first
shock
of
surprise
was
past
my
own
sweet
moll
come
hither
to
warm
her
old
father
heart
and
my
own
says
she
tenderly
which
i
fear
hath
grown
a
little
wanting
in
love
for
ye
since
i
have
been
mated
but
though
my
dear
dick
draws
so
deeply
from
my
well
of
affection
there
is
still
somewhere
down
here
clapping
her
hand
upon
her
heart
a
source
that
first
sprang
for
you
and
can
never
dry
aye
and
is
a
proof
says
he
your
coming
here
where
we
may
speak
and
act
without
restraint
though
it
be
but
for
five
minutes
five
minutes
cries
she
springing
up
with
her
natural
vivacity
why
i
not
leave
you
before
the
morning
unless
you
weary
of
me
and
then
with
infinite
relish
and
sly
humour
she
told
of
her
device
for
leaving
the
court
without
suspicion
i
do
confess
i
was
at
first
greatly
alarmed
for
the
safe
issue
of
this
escapade
but
she
assuring
me
was
a
dirty
night
and
she
had
passed
no
one
on
the
road
i
felt
a
little
reassured
to
be
sure
thinks
i
godwin
by
some
accident
may
return
but
finding
her
gone
and
hearing
captain
evans
keeps
me
to
my
house
he
must
conclude
she
has
come
hither
and
think
no
harm
of
her
for
that
neither
seeing
we
are
old
friends
and
sobered
with
years
for
is
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
feeling
lonely
and
dejected
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
she
should
seek
such
harmless
diversion
as
may
be
had
in
our
society
however
for
the
sake
of
appearances
i
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
get
this
provision
of
ham
and
birds
out
of
sight
for
fear
of
misadventure
and
also
i
took
instant
precaution
to
turn
the
key
in
my
street
door
being
but
two
men
and
neither
of
us
in
the
formalities
i
had
set
a
cheese
a
loaf
and
a
bottle
betwixt
us
on
the
bare
table
of
my
office
room
for
each
to
serve
himself
as
he
would
but
i
now
proposed
that
having
a
lady
in
our
company
we
should
pay
more
regard
to
the
decencies
by
going
upstairs
to
my
parlour
and
there
laying
a
tablecloth
and
napkins
for
our
repast
aye
certainly
cries
moll
who
had
grown
mighty
fastidious
in
these
particulars
since
she
had
been
mistress
of
hurst
court
this
dirty
table
would
spoil
the
best
appetite
in
the
world
so
i
carried
a
faggot
and
some
apple
logs
upstairs
and
soon
had
a
brave
fire
leaping
up
the
chimney
by
which
time
moll
and
her
father
with
abundant
mirth
had
set
forth
our
victuals
on
a
clean
white
cloth
and
to
each
of
us
a
clean
plate
knife
and
fork
most
proper
then
all
things
being
to
our
hand
we
sat
down
and
made
a
most
hearty
meal
of
butterby
good
cheer
and
all
three
of
us
as
merry
as
grigs
with
not
a
shadow
of
misgiving
there
had
seemed
something
piteous
to
me
in
that
appeal
of
moll
that
she
might
be
herself
for
this
night
and
indeed
i
marvelled
now
how
she
could
have
so
trained
her
natural
disposition
to
an
artificial
manner
and
did
no
longer
wonder
at
the
look
of
fatigue
and
weariness
in
her
face
on
her
return
to
london
for
the
old
reckless
careless
daredevil
spirit
was
still
alive
in
her
as
i
could
plainly
see
now
that
she
abandoned
herself
entirely
to
the
free
sway
of
impulse
the
old
twinkle
of
mirth
and
mischief
was
in
her
eyes
she
was
no
longer
a
fine
lady
but
a
merry
vagabond
again
and
when
she
laughed
was
with
her
hands
clasping
her
sides
her
head
thrown
back
and
all
her
white
teeth
gleaming
in
the
light
now
says
i
when
at
length
our
meal
was
finished
i
will
clear
the
table
hoop
cries
she
catching
up
the
corners
of
the
tablecloth
and
flinging
them
over
the
fragments
is
done
let
us
draw
round
the
fire
and
tell
old
tales
here
a
pipe
dear
dad
i
love
the
smell
of
tobacco
and
you
to
me
do
fetch
me
a
pipkin
that
i
may
brew
a
good
drink
to
keep
our
tongues
going
about
the
time
this
drink
was
brewed
simon
leading
godwin
by
a
circuitous
way
came
through
the
garden
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
was
a
door
which
i
had
never
opened
for
lack
of
a
key
to
fit
the
lock
this
key
was
now
in
simon
hand
and
putting
it
with
infinite
care
into
the
hole
he
softly
turned
it
in
the
wards
then
with
the
like
precaution
he
lifts
the
latch
and
gently
thrusts
the
door
open
listening
at
every
inch
to
catch
the
sounds
within
at
length
is
opened
wide
and
so
turning
his
face
to
godwin
who
waits
behind
sick
with
mingled
shame
and
creeping
dread
he
beckons
him
to
follow
above
dawson
was
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
a
he
had
learnt
of
a
mariner
at
the
inn
he
frequented
at
greenwich
with
a
troll
at
the
end
taken
up
by
moll
and
me
and
to
hear
his
wife
voice
bearing
part
in
this
rude
song
made
godwin
heart
to
sink
within
him
under
cover
of
this
noise
simon
mounted
the
stairs
without
hesitation
godwin
following
at
his
heels
in
a
kind
of
sick
bewilderment
was
pitch
dark
up
there
and
simon
stretching
forth
his
hands
to
know
if
godwin
was
by
touched
his
hand
which
was
deadly
cold
and
quivering
for
here
at
the
door
he
was
seized
with
a
sweating
faintness
which
so
sapped
his
vigour
that
he
was
forced
to
hold
by
the
wall
to
save
himself
from
falling
art
thee
ready
asks
simon
but
he
can
get
no
answer
for
energies
quickened
by
a
word
from
within
like
a
jaded
beast
by
the
sting
of
a
whip
is
straining
his
ears
to
catch
what
is
passing
within
and
what
hears
he
the
song
is
ended
and
dawson
cries
you
ha
lost
your
old
knack
of
catching
a
tune
moll
come
hither
wench
and
sit
upon
my
knee
for
i
do
love
ye
more
than
ever
give
me
a
buss
chuck
this
fine
husband
of
thine
shall
not
have
all
thy
sweetness
to
himself
at
this
moment
simon
having
lifted
the
latch
under
his
thumb
pushes
wide
open
the
door
and
there
through
the
thick
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
godwin
sees
the
table
in
disorder
the
white
cloth
flung
back
over
the
remnants
of
our
repast
and
stained
with
a
patch
of
liquor
from
an
overturned
mug
a
smutty
pipkin
set
upon
the
board
beside
a
dish
of
tobacco
and
a
broken
pipe
me
sitting
o
one
side
the
hearth
heavy
and
drowsy
with
too
much
good
cheer
and
on
side
his
young
wife
sitting
on
dawson
knee
with
one
arm
about
his
neck
and
he
in
his
uncouth
seaman
garb
with
a
pipe
in
one
hand
the
other
about
waist
her
yielded
cheek
with
a
cry
of
fury
like
any
wild
beast
he
springs
forward
and
clutches
at
a
knife
that
lies
ready
to
his
hand
upon
the
board
and
this
cry
is
answered
with
a
shriek
from
moll
as
she
starts
to
her
feet
who
is
this
drunken
villain
he
cries
stretching
the
knife
in
his
hand
towards
dawson
and
moll
flinging
herself
betwixt
the
knife
and
dawson
with
fear
for
his
life
and
yet
with
some
dignity
in
her
voice
and
gesture
answers
swiftly
this
drunken
villain
is
my
father
chapter
xxxi
conscience
is
quickened
by
grief
and
humiliation
beyond
the
stand
aside
moll
cries
dawson
stepping
to
the
fore
and
facing
godwin
this
is
my
crime
and
i
will
answer
for
it
with
my
blood
here
is
my
breast
tearing
open
his
jerkin
strike
for
i
alone
have
done
you
wrong
this
child
of
mine
being
but
an
instrument
to
my
purpose
godwin
hand
fell
by
his
side
and
the
knife
slipped
from
his
fingers
speak
says
he
thickly
after
a
moment
of
horrible
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
the
knife
striking
the
floor
if
this
is
your
daughter
if
she
has
lied
to
me
what
in
god
name
is
the
truth
who
are
you
i
ask
john
dawson
a
player
answers
he
seeing
the
time
is
past
for
lying
godwin
makes
no
response
but
turns
his
eyes
upon
moll
who
stands
before
him
with
bowed
head
and
clasped
hands
wrung
to
her
innermost
fibre
with
shame
remorse
and
awful
dread
and
for
a
terrible
space
i
heard
nothing
but
the
deep
painful
breathing
of
this
poor
overwrought
man
you
are
my
wife
says
he
at
length
follow
me
and
with
that
he
turns
about
and
goes
from
the
room
then
moll
without
a
look
at
us
without
a
word
her
face
ghastly
pale
and
drawn
with
agony
with
faltering
steps
obeys
catching
at
table
and
chair
as
she
passes
for
support
dawson
made
a
step
forward
as
if
he
would
have
overtaken
her
but
i
withheld
him
shaking
my
head
and
himself
seeing
was
in
vain
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
spreading
his
arms
upon
the
table
hides
his
face
in
them
with
a
groan
of
despair
moll
totters
down
the
dark
stairs
and
finds
her
husband
standing
in
the
doorway
his
figure
revealed
against
the
patch
of
grey
light
beyond
for
the
moon
was
risen
though
veiled
by
a
thick
pall
of
cloud
he
sees
as
she
comes
to
his
side
that
she
has
neither
cloak
nor
hood
to
protect
her
from
the
winter
wind
and
in
silence
he
takes
off
his
own
cloak
and
lays
it
on
her
shoulder
at
this
act
of
mercy
a
ray
of
hope
animates
moll
numbed
soul
and
she
catches
at
her
husband
hand
to
press
it
to
her
lips
yet
can
find
never
a
word
to
express
her
gratitude
but
his
hand
is
cold
as
ice
and
he
draws
it
away
from
her
firmly
with
obvious
repugnance
there
was
no
love
in
this
little
act
of
giving
her
his
cloak
was
but
the
outcome
of
that
chivalry
in
gentlemen
which
doth
exact
lenience
even
to
an
enemy
so
he
goes
on
his
way
she
following
like
a
whipped
dog
at
his
heels
till
they
reach
the
court
gates
and
these
being
fast
locked
on
a
little
further
to
the
wicket
gate
and
there
as
godwin
is
about
to
enter
there
confronts
him
peter
that
sturdy
puritan
hireling
of
old
simon
thee
canst
not
enter
here
friend
says
he
in
his
canting
voice
as
he
sets
his
foot
against
the
gate
know
you
who
i
am
asks
godwin
yea
friend
and
i
know
who
thy
woman
is
also
i
am
bidden
by
friend
simon
the
true
and
faithful
steward
of
mistress
godwin
in
barbary
to
defend
her
house
and
lands
against
robbers
and
of
every
kind
and
without
respect
of
their
degree
and
with
the
lord
help
adds
he
showing
a
stout
cudgel
that
will
i
do
friend
is
true
fellow
returns
godwin
i
have
no
right
to
enter
here
and
then
turning
about
he
stands
irresolute
as
not
knowing
whither
he
shall
go
to
find
shelter
for
his
wife
for
very
shame
he
does
not
take
her
to
the
village
inn
to
be
questioned
by
gaping
servants
and
landlord
who
ere
long
must
catch
the
flying
news
of
her
shameful
condition
and
overthrow
a
faint
light
in
the
lattice
of
anne
cottage
catches
his
eye
and
he
crosses
to
her
door
still
humbly
followed
by
poor
moll
there
he
finds
the
gone
from
the
latch
to
him
a
sign
that
mother
fitch
has
gone
out
so
pulling
the
hidden
string
he
wots
of
he
lifts
the
latch
within
and
the
door
opens
to
his
hand
a
rush
is
burning
in
a
cup
of
oil
upon
the
table
casting
a
feeble
glimmer
round
the
empty
room
he
closes
the
door
when
moll
has
entered
sets
a
chair
before
the
hearth
and
rakes
the
embers
together
to
give
her
warmth
forgive
me
oh
forgive
me
cries
moll
casting
herself
at
his
feet
as
he
turns
and
clasping
his
knees
to
her
stricken
heart
illustration
forgive
me
oh
forgive
me
forgive
you
says
he
bitterly
forgive
you
for
dragging
me
down
to
the
level
of
rogues
and
thieves
for
making
me
party
to
this
vile
conspiracy
of
plunder
a
conspiracy
that
if
it
bring
me
not
beneath
the
lash
of
justice
must
blast
my
name
and
fame
for
ever
you
know
not
what
you
ask
as
well
might
you
bid
me
take
you
back
to
finish
the
night
in
drunken
riot
with
those
others
of
our
gang
oh
no
not
now
not
now
cries
moll
in
agony
do
but
say
that
some
day
long
hence
you
will
forgive
me
give
me
that
hope
for
i
can
not
live
without
it
that
hope
my
fear
says
he
i
have
known
men
who
by
mere
contact
with
depravity
have
so
dulled
their
sense
of
shame
that
they
could
make
light
of
sins
that
once
appalled
them
who
knows
but
that
one
day
i
may
forgive
you
chat
easily
upon
this
villany
maybe
regret
i
went
no
further
in
it
oh
god
forbid
that
shall
be
of
my
doing
cries
moll
springing
to
her
feet
broken
as
i
am
i
not
accept
forgiveness
on
such
terms
think
you
i
like
those
wretches
who
of
wanton
wickedness
ran
from
their
beds
to
infect
the
clean
with
their
foul
ill
not
i
i
spoke
in
heat
says
godwin
quickly
i
repent
even
now
what
i
said
am
i
so
steeped
in
infamy
continues
she
that
i
am
past
all
cure
think
adds
she
piteously
i
am
not
eighteen
yet
i
was
but
a
child
a
year
ago
with
no
more
judgment
of
right
and
wrong
than
a
savage
creature
until
i
loved
you
i
think
i
scarcely
knew
the
meaning
of
conscience
the
knowledge
came
when
i
yearned
to
keep
no
secret
from
you
i
do
remember
the
first
struggle
to
do
right
was
on
the
little
bridge
and
there
i
balanced
awhile
cheating
you
and
robbing
myself
and
then
for
fear
you
would
not
marry
me
i
dared
not
own
the
truth
oh
had
i
thought
you
only
keep
me
for
your
mistress
i
have
told
you
i
was
not
your
cousin
little
as
this
is
there
surely
hope
i
is
it
more
impossible
that
you
a
strong
man
should
lift
me
than
that
i
a
weak
girl
no
more
than
that
should
drag
you
down
i
did
not
weigh
my
words
yet
they
were
true
says
she
is
bred
in
my
body
part
of
my
nature
this
spirit
of
evil
and
exist
as
long
as
i
for
even
now
i
do
feel
that
i
would
do
this
wickedness
again
and
worse
to
win
you
once
more
my
poor
wife
says
he
touched
with
pity
and
holding
forth
his
arms
she
goes
to
them
and
lays
her
cheek
against
his
breast
and
there
stands
crying
very
silently
with
mingled
thoughts
now
of
the
room
she
had
prepared
with
such
delight
against
his
return
of
her
little
table
in
the
corner
with
the
chiney
image
atop
and
other
trifles
with
which
she
had
dreamed
to
give
him
pleasure
all
lost
no
more
would
she
sit
by
his
side
there
watching
with
wonder
and
pride
the
growth
of
beauty
his
dexterous
hand
and
then
she
feels
that
is
compassion
not
love
that
hath
opened
his
arms
to
her
that
she
hath
killed
his
respect
for
her
and
with
it
his
love
and
so
stifling
the
sobs
that
rise
in
her
throat
she
weeps
on
till
her
tears
trickling
from
her
cheek
fall
upon
his
hand
the
icy
barrier
of
resentment
is
melted
by
the
first
warm
tear
this
silent
testimony
of
her
smothered
grief
and
bursting
from
the
bonds
of
reason
he
yields
to
the
passionate
impulse
of
his
heart
and
clasping
this
poor
sorrowing
wife
to
his
breast
he
seeks
to
kiss
away
the
tears
from
her
cheek
and
soothe
her
with
gentle
words
she
responds
to
his
passion
kiss
for
kiss
as
she
clasps
her
hands
about
his
head
but
still
her
tears
flow
on
for
with
her
readier
wit
she
perceives
that
this
is
but
the
transport
of
passion
on
his
side
and
not
the
untaxed
outcome
of
enduring
love
proving
again
the
truth
of
his
unmeditated
prophecy
for
how
can
he
stand
who
yields
so
quickly
to
the
first
assault
and
if
he
can
not
stand
how
can
he
raise
her
surely
and
more
surely
little
by
little
they
must
sink
together
to
some
lower
depth
and
one
day
thinks
she
repeating
his
words
we
may
chat
easily
upon
this
villany
and
regret
we
went
no
further
in
it
godwin
leads
her
to
the
adjoining
chamber
which
had
been
his
and
says
lie
down
love
we
shall
see
things
clearer
and
think
more
reasonably
yes
says
she
in
return
more
reasonably
and
with
that
she
does
his
bidding
and
he
returns
to
sit
before
the
embers
and
meditate
and
here
he
stays
striving
in
vain
to
bring
the
tumult
of
his
thoughts
to
some
coherent
shape
until
from
sheer
exhaustion
he
falls
into
a
kind
of
lethargy
of
sleep
meanwhile
moll
lying
in
the
dark
had
been
thinking
also
but
as
women
will
at
such
times
with
clearer
perception
so
that
her
ideas
forming
in
logical
sequence
and
growing
more
clear
and
decisive
as
an
argument
becomes
more
lively
and
conclusive
by
successful
reasoning
served
to
stimulate
her
intellect
and
excite
her
activity
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
she
rose
quickly
from
her
bed
and
looked
into
the
next
room
where
she
saw
her
husband
sitting
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
his
hands
folded
upon
his
knee
before
the
dead
fire
then
wrapping
his
cloak
about
her
she
steals
toward
the
outer
door
but
passing
him
she
must
needs
pause
at
his
back
to
staunch
her
tears
a
moment
and
look
down
upon
him
for
the
last
time
the
light
shines
in
his
brown
hair
and
she
bending
down
till
her
lips
touch
a
stray
curl
they
part
silently
and
she
breathes
upon
him
from
her
very
soul
a
mute
fare
thee
well
dear
love
but
she
will
wait
no
longer
fearing
her
courage
may
give
way
and
the
next
minute
she
is
out
in
the
night
softly
drawing
the
door
to
that
separates
these
two
for
ever
chapter
xxxii
we
fought
a
most
bloody
battle
with
simon
the
constable
and
for
some
time
we
spoke
never
a
word
dawson
and
i
he
with
his
head
lying
on
his
arm
i
seated
in
a
chair
with
my
hands
hanging
down
by
my
side
quite
stunned
by
the
blow
that
had
fallen
upon
us
at
length
raising
his
head
his
eyes
puffed
and
his
face
bedaubed
with
tears
he
says
ha
you
a
word
of
comfort
kit
for
a
man
i
stammered
a
few
words
that
had
more
sound
than
sense
but
indeed
i
needed
consolation
myself
seeing
my
own
responsibility
for
bringing
this
misfortune
upon
moll
and
being
most
heartily
ashamed
of
my
roguery
now
was
discovered
you
do
think
he
be
too
hard
on
poor
moll
tell
me
that
kit
aye
he
forgive
her
says
i
sooner
than
us
or
we
ourselves
and
you
do
think
he
be
for
ever
it
in
her
teeth
that
her
father
a
a
drunken
vagabond
eh
nay
i
believe
he
is
too
good
a
man
for
that
then
says
he
standing
up
i
go
and
tell
him
the
whole
story
and
you
shall
come
with
me
to
bear
me
out
will
be
time
enough
says
i
flinching
from
this
office
is
late
now
no
matter
for
that
time
enough
to
sleep
when
we
settled
this
business
we
not
leave
poor
moll
to
bear
all
the
punishment
of
our
getting
godwin
shall
know
what
an
innocent
simple
child
she
was
when
we
pushed
her
into
this
knavery
and
how
we
dared
not
tell
her
of
our
purpose
lest
she
should
draw
back
he
shall
know
how
she
was
ever
an
obedient
docile
artless
girl
yielding
always
to
my
guidance
and
you
can
stretch
a
point
kit
to
say
you
have
ever
known
me
for
a
headstrong
masterful
sort
of
a
fellow
who
would
take
denial
from
none
but
must
have
my
own
way
in
all
things
i
take
all
the
blame
on
my
own
shoulders
as
i
should
have
done
at
first
but
i
was
so
staggered
by
this
fall
well
says
i
if
you
will
have
it
so
i
will
says
he
stoutly
and
now
give
me
a
bucket
of
water
that
i
may
souse
my
head
and
wear
a
brave
look
i
would
have
him
think
the
worst
of
me
that
he
may
feel
the
kinder
to
poor
moll
and
i
make
what
atonement
i
can
adds
he
as
i
led
him
into
my
if
he
desire
it
i
will
promise
never
to
see
moll
again
nay
i
will
offer
to
take
the
king
bounty
and
go
and
so
betwixt
sickness
and
the
dutch
there
be
an
end
of
jack
dawson
in
a
very
short
space
when
he
had
ducked
his
head
in
a
bowl
of
water
and
got
our
cloaks
from
the
room
below
we
went
to
the
door
and
there
to
my
dismay
i
found
the
lock
fast
and
the
key
which
i
had
left
in
its
socket
gone
what
amiss
kit
asks
dawson
perceiving
my
consternation
the
key
the
key
says
i
holding
the
candle
here
and
there
to
seek
it
on
the
floor
then
giving
up
my
search
as
it
struck
me
that
godwin
and
moll
could
not
have
left
the
house
had
the
door
been
locked
on
the
inside
i
do
believe
we
are
locked
in
and
made
prisoners
says
i
why
sure
this
is
not
godwin
doing
cries
he
is
simon
says
i
with
conviction
seeing
him
again
in
my
mind
standing
behind
godwin
with
wicked
triumph
in
his
face
is
there
no
other
door
but
this
one
asks
dawson
there
is
one
at
the
back
but
i
have
never
yet
opened
that
for
lack
of
a
key
and
now
setting
one
thing
against
another
and
recalling
how
i
had
before
found
the
door
open
when
i
felt
sure
i
had
locked
it
fast
the
truth
appeared
to
me
namely
that
simon
had
that
key
and
did
get
in
the
back
way
going
out
by
the
front
on
that
former
occasion
in
haste
upon
some
sudden
alarm
is
there
never
a
window
we
can
slip
through
asks
jack
only
those
above
stairs
the
lower
are
all
barred
a
fig
for
his
bars
does
he
think
we
have
neither
hands
nor
wits
to
be
hindered
by
this
silly
woman
trick
is
no
silly
trick
he
not
the
man
to
do
an
idle
thing
mischief
in
this
what
mischief
can
he
do
us
more
than
he
has
done
for
i
see
his
hand
in
our
misfortune
what
mischief
i
say
out
with
it
man
for
your
looks
betray
a
fear
of
something
worse
faith
jack
i
dread
he
has
gone
to
fetch
help
and
will
lodge
us
in
gaol
for
this
business
gaol
cries
he
in
a
passion
of
desperation
why
this
will
undo
moll
for
ever
her
husband
can
never
forgive
her
putting
such
shame
upon
him
rouse
yourself
man
from
your
stupor
get
me
something
in
the
shape
of
a
hammer
for
god
sake
that
we
may
burst
our
way
from
this
accursed
trap
i
bethought
me
of
an
axe
for
splitting
wood
that
lay
in
the
kitchen
and
fetching
it
quickly
i
put
it
in
his
hand
bidding
me
stand
aside
he
let
fly
at
the
door
like
a
madman
the
splinters
flew
but
the
door
held
good
and
when
he
stayed
a
moment
to
take
a
new
grip
on
his
axe
i
heard
a
clamour
of
voices
outside
simon
higher
than
the
rest
crying
my
new
door
that
cost
me
seven
and
eightpence
the
lock
the
lock
says
i
strike
that
off
down
came
the
axe
striking
a
spark
of
fire
from
the
lock
which
fell
with
a
clatter
at
the
next
blow
but
ere
we
had
time
to
open
the
door
simon
and
his
party
entering
by
the
back
door
forced
us
to
turn
for
our
defence
perceiving
dawson
armed
with
an
axe
however
these
fellows
paused
and
the
leader
whom
i
recognised
for
the
constable
of
our
parish
carrying
a
staff
in
one
hand
and
a
lanthorn
in
cried
to
us
in
the
king
name
to
surrender
ourselves
take
us
if
you
can
cries
dawson
and
the
lord
have
mercy
on
the
first
who
comes
within
my
reach
deftly
enough
old
simon
snatching
the
fellow
cap
who
stood
next
him
flings
it
at
the
candle
that
stands
flaring
on
the
floor
and
justles
the
constable
lanthorn
from
his
hand
so
that
in
a
moment
we
were
all
in
darkness
taking
us
at
this
disadvantage
for
dawson
dared
not
lay
about
him
with
his
axe
for
fear
of
hitting
me
by
misadventure
the
rascals
closed
at
once
and
a
most
bloody
desperate
fight
ensued
for
after
the
first
onslaught
in
which
dawson
dropping
his
axe
as
being
useless
at
such
close
quarters
and
i
grappled
each
our
man
the
rest
knowing
not
friend
from
foe
in
the
obscurity
and
urged
on
by
fear
fell
upon
each
other
this
one
striking
out
at
the
first
he
met
and
that
giving
as
good
as
he
had
taken
and
so
all
fell
and
belabouring
with
such
lust
of
vengeance
that
presently
the
whole
place
was
of
an
uproar
with
the
din
of
cursing
howling
and
hard
blows
for
my
own
lot
i
had
old
simon
to
deal
with
as
i
knew
at
once
by
the
cold
greasy
feel
of
his
leathern
jerkin
he
being
enraged
to
make
me
his
prisoner
for
the
ill
i
had
done
him
hooking
his
horny
fingers
about
my
throat
he
clung
to
me
like
any
wildcat
but
stumbling
shortly
over
two
who
were
rolling
on
the
floor
we
went
down
both
with
a
crack
and
with
such
violence
that
he
being
undermost
was
stunned
by
the
fall
then
my
blood
boiling
at
this
treatment
i
got
astride
of
him
and
roasted
his
ribs
royally
and
with
more
force
than
ever
i
had
conceived
myself
to
be
possessed
of
and
growing
beside
myself
with
this
passion
of
war
i
do
think
i
should
have
pounded
him
into
a
pulp
but
that
two
other
combatants
falling
across
me
with
their
whole
weight
knocked
all
the
wind
out
of
my
body
oppressing
me
so
grievously
that
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
draw
myself
out
of
the
fray
and
get
a
gasp
of
breath
again
about
this
time
the
uproar
began
to
subside
for
those
who
had
got
the
worst
of
the
battle
thought
it
advisable
to
sneak
out
of
the
house
for
safety
and
those
who
had
fared
better
fearing
a
reverse
of
fortune
counted
they
had
done
enough
for
this
bout
and
so
also
withdrew
are
you
living
kit
asks
dawson
then
aye
says
i
as
valiantly
as
you
please
and
ready
to
fight
another
such
rascals
but
pulling
the
broken
door
open
all
the
same
to
get
out
the
easier
in
case
they
returned
why
then
let
go
says
he
unless
any
is
minded
to
have
us
stay
no
one
responding
to
this
challenge
we
made
ado
to
find
a
couple
of
hats
and
cloaks
for
our
use
and
sallied
out
which
way
do
we
turn
asks
dawson
as
we
come
into
the
road
whither
would
you
go
jack
why
to
warn
moll
of
her
danger
to
be
sure
i
apprehended
no
danger
to
her
and
believed
her
husband
would
defend
her
in
any
case
better
than
we
could
but
dawson
would
have
it
we
should
warn
them
and
so
we
turned
towards
the
court
and
now
upon
examination
we
found
we
had
come
very
well
out
of
this
fight
for
save
that
the
wound
in
dawson
hand
had
been
opened
afresh
we
were
neither
much
the
worse
but
let
us
set
our
best
foot
foremost
jack
says
i
for
i
do
think
we
have
done
more
mischief
than
any
we
have
before
and
i
shall
not
be
greatly
surprised
if
we
are
called
to
account
for
the
death
of
old
simon
or
some
of
his
hirelings
i
know
not
how
that
may
be
says
he
but
i
must
answer
for
knocking
of
somebody
teeth
out
chapter
xxxiii
take
moll
to
greenwich
but
no
great
happiness
for
her
in
the
midst
of
our
heroics
i
was
greatly
scared
by
perceiving
a
cloaked
figure
coming
hurriedly
towards
us
in
the
dim
light
is
another
come
to
succour
his
friends
whispers
i
let
us
step
into
this
hedge
too
late
returns
he
put
on
a
bold
face
is
only
one
with
a
swaggering
gait
and
looking
straight
before
us
we
had
passed
the
figure
when
a
voice
calls
father
and
there
turning
we
find
that
poor
moll
in
her
husband
cloak
where
is
thy
husband
child
asks
dawson
as
he
recovers
from
his
astonishment
taking
moll
by
the
hand
i
have
no
husband
father
answers
she
piteously
why
sure
he
hath
not
turned
you
out
of
doors
no
he
not
do
that
says
she
were
i
ten
times
more
wicked
than
i
am
what
folly
then
is
this
asks
her
father
is
no
folly
i
have
left
him
of
my
own
free
will
and
shall
never
go
back
to
him
for
he
no
more
my
husband
than
that
house
is
mine
pointing
to
the
court
both
were
got
by
the
same
means
and
both
are
lost
then
briefly
she
told
how
they
had
been
turned
from
the
gate
by
peter
and
how
godwin
was
now
as
poor
and
homeless
as
we
and
this
news
throwing
us
into
a
silence
with
new
bewilderment
she
asks
us
simply
whither
we
are
going
my
poor
moll
is
all
the
answer
dawson
can
make
and
that
in
a
broken
trembling
voice
is
no
good
to
cry
says
she
dashing
aside
her
tears
that
had
sprung
at
this
word
of
loving
sympathy
and
forcing
herself
to
a
more
cheerful
tone
why
let
us
think
that
we
are
just
awake
from
a
long
sleep
to
find
ourselves
no
worse
off
than
when
we
fell
nay
not
so
ill
adds
she
for
you
have
a
home
near
london
take
me
there
dear
with
all
my
heart
chuck
answers
her
father
eagerly
there
at
least
i
can
give
you
a
shelter
till
your
husband
can
offer
better
she
would
not
dispute
this
point
though
i
perceived
clearly
her
mind
was
resolved
fully
never
to
claim
her
right
to
godwin
roof
but
only
begged
we
should
hasten
on
our
way
saying
she
felt
chilled
and
in
passing
mother
fitch
cottage
she
constrained
us
to
silence
and
caution
then
when
we
were
safely
past
she
would
have
us
run
still
feigning
to
be
cold
but
in
truth
as
i
think
to
avoid
being
overtaken
by
godwin
fearing
maybe
that
he
would
overrule
her
will
this
way
we
sped
till
moll
was
fain
to
stop
with
a
little
cry
of
pain
and
clapping
her
hand
to
her
heart
being
fairly
spent
and
out
of
breath
then
we
took
her
betwixt
us
lending
her
our
arms
for
support
and
falling
into
a
more
regular
pace
made
good
progress
we
trudged
on
till
we
reached
croydon
without
any
accident
save
that
at
one
point
step
faltering
and
she
with
a
faint
sob
weighing
heavily
upon
our
arms
we
stopped
as
thinking
her
strength
overtaxed
and
then
glancing
about
me
i
perceived
we
were
upon
that
little
bridge
where
we
had
overtaken
godwin
and
he
had
offered
to
make
moll
his
wife
then
i
knew
was
not
fatigue
that
weighed
her
down
and
gauging
her
feelings
by
my
own
remorse
i
pitied
this
poor
wife
even
more
than
i
blamed
myself
for
had
she
revealed
herself
to
him
at
that
time
though
he
might
have
shrunk
from
marriage
he
must
have
loved
her
still
and
so
she
had
been
spared
this
shame
and
hopeless
sorrow
at
croydon
we
overtook
a
carrier
on
his
way
to
london
for
the
saturday
market
who
for
a
couple
of
shillings
gave
us
a
place
in
his
waggon
with
some
good
bundles
of
hay
for
a
seat
and
here
was
rest
for
our
tired
bodies
though
little
for
our
tormented
minds
till
we
reached
marsh
end
where
we
were
set
down
and
so
the
ground
being
hard
with
frost
across
the
marsh
to
greenwich
about
daybreak
having
the
key
of
his
workshop
with
him
dawson
took
us
into
his
lodgings
without
disturbing
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
who
might
well
have
marvelled
to
see
us
enter
at
this
hour
with
a
woman
in
a
man
cloak
and
no
covering
but
a
handkerchief
to
her
head
and
moll
taking
his
bed
we
disposed
ourselves
on
some
shavings
in
his
shop
to
get
a
little
sleep
dawson
was
already
risen
when
i
awoke
and
going
into
his
little
parlour
i
found
him
mighty
busy
setting
the
place
in
order
which
was
in
a
sad
bachelor
pickle
to
be
sure
all
littered
up
with
odds
and
ends
of
turning
unwashed
plates
broken
victuals
just
as
he
had
left
it
she
asleep
says
he
in
a
whisper
and
i
have
this
room
like
a
little
palace
against
she
comes
into
it
so
do
you
lend
me
a
hand
kit
and
make
no
more
noise
than
you
can
help
the
kitchen
through
that
door
carry
everything
in
there
and
what
of
no
use
fling
out
of
the
window
into
the
road
setting
to
with
a
will
we
got
the
parlour
and
kitchen
neat
and
proper
plates
washed
tiles
wiped
pots
and
pans
hung
up
furniture
furbished
up
and
everything
in
its
place
in
no
time
then
leaving
me
to
light
a
fire
in
the
parlour
dawson
goes
forth
with
a
basket
on
his
arm
in
high
glee
and
truly
to
see
the
pleasure
in
his
face
later
on
making
a
mess
of
bread
and
milk
in
one
pipkin
and
cooking
eggs
in
another
for
now
we
heard
moll
stirring
in
her
chamber
one
would
have
thought
that
this
was
an
occasion
for
rejoicing
rather
than
grief
and
this
was
due
not
to
want
of
kind
feeling
but
to
the
fond
simple
nature
of
him
he
being
manly
enough
in
some
ways
but
a
very
child
in
others
he
did
never
see
further
than
his
nose
as
one
says
and
because
it
gave
him
joy
to
have
moll
beside
him
once
more
he
must
needs
think
hopefully
that
she
will
quickly
recover
from
this
reverse
of
fortune
and
that
all
will
come
right
again
our
dear
moll
did
nothing
to
damp
his
hopes
but
played
her
part
bravely
and
well
to
spare
him
the
anguish
of
remorse
that
secretly
wrung
her
own
heart
she
met
us
with
a
cheerful
countenance
admired
the
neatness
of
the
parlour
the
glowing
fire
ate
her
share
of
porridge
and
finding
the
eggs
cooked
hard
declared
she
could
not
abide
them
soft
then
she
would
see
her
father
work
his
lathe
to
his
great
delight
and
begged
he
would
make
her
some
cups
for
eggs
as
being
more
to
our
present
fashion
than
eating
them
from
one
hand
why
says
he
there
an
old
in
the
corner
that
will
serve
me
to
a
nicety
but
first
i
must
see
our
landlord
and
engage
a
room
for
kit
and
me
for
i
take
it
my
dear
adds
he
you
will
be
content
to
stay
with
us
here
yes
answers
she
is
a
most
cheerful
view
of
the
river
from
the
windows
she
tucked
up
her
skirt
and
sleeves
to
busy
herself
in
household
matters
and
when
i
would
have
relieved
her
of
this
office
she
begged
me
to
go
and
bear
her
father
company
saying
with
a
piteous
look
in
her
eyes
that
we
must
leave
her
some
occupation
or
she
should
weary
she
was
pale
there
were
dark
lines
beneath
her
eyes
and
she
was
silent
but
i
saw
no
outward
sign
of
grief
till
the
afternoon
when
coming
from
jack
shop
unexpected
i
spied
her
sitting
by
the
window
with
her
face
in
her
hands
bowed
over
a
piece
of
cloth
we
had
bought
in
the
morning
which
she
was
about
to
fashion
into
a
plain
gown
as
being
more
suitable
to
her
condition
than
the
rich
dress
in
which
she
had
left
the
court
poor
soul
thinks
i
here
is
a
sad
awaking
from
thy
dream
of
riches
and
joy
upon
a
seasonable
occasion
i
told
dawson
we
must
soon
begin
to
think
of
doing
something
for
a
livelihood
a
matter
which
was
as
remote
from
his
consideration
as
the
day
of
wrath
why
kit
says
he
i
as
good
as
fifty
pounds
yet
in
a
hole
at
the
chimney
back
aye
but
when
that
gone
says
i
that
a
good
way
hence
kit
but
there
never
was
such
a
man
as
you
for
going
forth
to
meet
troubles
half
way
however
i
warrant
i
shall
find
some
jobs
of
carpentry
to
keep
us
from
begging
our
bread
when
the
pinch
comes
not
content
to
wait
for
this
pinch
i
resolved
i
would
go
into
the
city
and
enquire
there
if
the
booksellers
could
give
me
any
employment
thinking
i
might
very
well
write
some
good
sermons
on
honesty
now
i
had
learnt
the
folly
of
roguery
hearing
of
my
purpose
the
morning
i
was
about
to
go
moll
takes
me
aside
and
asks
me
in
a
quavering
voice
if
i
knew
where
godwin
might
be
found
this
question
staggered
me
a
moment
for
her
husband
name
had
not
been
spoken
by
any
of
us
since
the
catastrophe
and
it
came
into
my
mind
now
that
she
designed
to
return
to
him
and
i
stammered
out
some
foolish
hint
at
hurst
court
no
he
is
not
there
says
he
but
i
thought
maybe
that
sir
peter
lely
aye
says
i
he
will
most
likely
know
where
godwin
may
be
found
can
you
tell
me
where
sir
peter
lives
no
but
i
can
learn
easily
when
i
am
in
the
city
if
you
can
write
the
address
and
send
him
this
says
she
drawing
a
letter
from
her
breast
she
had
writ
her
husband
name
on
it
and
now
she
pressed
her
lips
to
it
twice
and
putting
the
warm
letter
in
my
hand
she
turned
away
her
poor
mouth
twitching
with
smothered
grief
i
knew
then
that
there
was
no
thought
in
her
mind
of
seeing
her
husband
again
i
carried
the
letter
with
me
to
the
city
wondering
what
was
in
it
i
know
not
now
yet
i
think
it
contained
but
a
few
words
of
explanation
and
farewell
with
some
prayer
maybe
that
she
might
be
forgiven
and
forgotten
learning
where
sir
peter
lely
lived
i
myself
went
to
his
house
and
he
not
being
at
home
i
asked
his
servant
if
godwin
did
sometimes
come
there
why
yes
sir
he
was
here
but
yesterday
answers
he
indeed
never
a
day
passes
but
he
calls
to
ask
if
any
one
hath
sought
him
in
that
case
says
i
slipping
a
piece
in
his
ready
hand
and
fetching
out
moll
letter
you
will
give
him
this
when
he
comes
next
that
i
will
sir
and
without
fail
but
if
you
would
see
him
sir
he
bids
me
say
he
is
ever
at
his
lodging
in
holborn
from
five
in
the
evening
to
eight
in
the
morning
answer
all
ends
if
you
give
him
that
letter
he
is
in
good
health
i
hope
well
sir
he
is
and
he
is
as
you
may
say
answers
he
dropping
into
a
familiar
confidential
tone
after
casting
his
eye
over
me
to
be
sure
i
was
no
great
person
he
ails
nothing
to
be
sure
for
i
hear
he
is
ever
afoot
from
morn
till
even
hither
and
thither
but
a
more
downhearted
rueful
looking
gentleman
for
his
age
i
never
see
you
and
me
sir
i
think
he
hath
lost
his
sweetheart
seeing
i
am
charged
with
sir
peter
permission
to
follow
and
not
lose
sight
of
any
lady
who
may
chance
to
call
here
for
him
i
walked
back
to
greenwich
across
the
fields
debating
in
my
mind
whether
i
should
tell
moll
of
her
husband
distress
or
not
so
perplexed
with
conflicting
arguments
that
i
had
come
to
no
decision
when
i
reached
home
moll
spying
me
coming
from
her
window
in
the
front
of
the
house
met
me
at
the
door
in
her
cloak
and
hood
and
begged
i
would
take
her
a
little
turn
over
the
heath
what
have
you
to
tell
me
asks
she
pressing
my
arm
as
we
walked
on
i
have
given
your
letter
to
sir
peter
lely
servant
who
promises
to
deliver
it
faithfully
to
your
husband
well
says
she
after
a
little
pause
of
silence
that
is
not
all
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
he
is
well
in
health
says
i
and
then
i
stop
again
all
hanging
in
a
hedge
for
not
knowing
whether
it
were
wiser
to
speak
or
hold
my
tongue
there
is
something
else
i
see
it
in
your
face
hide
nothing
from
me
for
love
sake
says
she
piteously
whereupon
my
heart
getting
the
better
of
my
head
which
to
be
sure
was
no
great
achievement
i
told
all
as
i
have
set
it
down
here
my
dear
dear
love
my
darling
dick
says
she
in
the
end
and
then
she
would
have
it
told
all
over
again
with
a
thousand
questions
to
draw
forth
more
and
these
being
exhausted
she
asks
why
i
would
have
concealed
so
much
from
her
and
if
i
did
fear
she
would
seek
him
nay
my
dear
says
i
is
way
about
for
if
your
husband
does
forgive
you
and
yearns
but
to
take
you
back
into
his
arms
it
would
be
an
unnatural
cruel
thing
to
keep
you
apart
therefore
to
confess
the
whole
truth
i
did
meditate
going
to
him
and
showing
how
we
and
not
you
are
to
blame
in
this
matter
and
then
telling
him
where
he
might
find
you
if
on
reflection
he
felt
that
he
could
honestly
hold
you
guiltless
but
ere
i
do
that
as
i
see
now
i
must
know
if
you
are
willing
to
this
accommodation
for
if
you
are
not
then
are
our
wounds
all
opened
afresh
to
no
purpose
but
to
retard
their
healing
she
made
no
reply
nor
any
comment
for
a
long
time
nor
did
i
seek
to
bias
her
judgment
by
a
single
word
doubting
my
wisdom
but
i
perceived
by
the
quivering
of
her
arm
within
mine
that
a
terrible
conflict
passion
and
principle
was
convulsing
every
fibre
of
her
being
at
the
top
of
the
hill
above
greenwich
she
stopped
and
throwing
back
her
hood
let
the
keen
wind
blow
upon
her
face
as
she
gazed
over
the
grey
flats
beyond
the
river
and
the
air
seeming
to
give
her
strength
and
a
clearer
perception
she
says
presently
accommodation
and
she
repeats
this
unlucky
word
of
mine
twice
or
thrice
as
if
she
liked
it
less
each
time
that
means
we
shall
agree
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
do
our
best
to
get
along
together
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
as
easily
as
we
may
that
it
my
dear
says
i
cheerfully
hush
up
the
past
continues
she
in
the
same
calculating
tone
conceal
it
from
the
world
if
possible
invent
some
new
lie
to
deceive
the
curious
and
hoodwink
our
decent
friends
chuckle
at
our
success
and
come
in
time
here
she
paused
a
moment
to
so
lightly
of
our
past
knavery
that
we
could
wish
we
had
gone
farther
in
the
business
then
turning
about
to
me
she
asks
if
you
were
writing
the
story
of
my
life
for
a
play
would
you
end
it
thus
my
dear
says
i
a
play
one
thing
real
life
another
and
believe
me
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
of
real
life
the
less
heroics
there
are
in
it
the
better
parts
are
those
for
the
actors
i
she
shook
her
head
fiercely
in
the
wind
and
turning
about
with
a
brusque
vigour
cries
come
on
i
have
no
accommodation
and
yet
says
she
stopping
short
after
a
couple
of
hasty
steps
and
with
a
fervent
earnestness
in
her
voice
and
yet
if
i
could
wipe
out
this
stain
if
by
any
act
i
could
redeem
my
fault
god
knows
i
do
it
cost
what
it
might
to
be
honoured
once
again
by
my
dear
dick
this
comes
of
living
in
a
theatre
all
her
life
thinks
i
and
indeed
in
this
as
in
other
matters
yet
to
be
told
the
teaching
of
the
stage
was
but
too
evident
chapter
xxxiv
agree
to
go
out
to
spain
again
in
search
of
our
old
another
week
passed
by
and
then
dawson
shortsighted
as
he
was
in
his
selfishness
began
to
perceive
that
things
were
not
coming
all
right
as
he
had
expected
once
or
twice
when
i
went
into
his
shop
i
caught
him
sitting
idle
before
his
lathe
with
a
most
look
in
his
face
what
amiss
jack
asks
i
one
day
when
i
found
him
thus
he
looked
to
see
that
the
door
was
shut
and
then
says
he
gloomily
she
do
sing
as
she
used
to
kit
she
do
laugh
hearty
i
hunched
my
shoulders
she
does
play
us
any
of
her
old
pranks
continues
he
she
say
one
thing
and
go
and
do
the
next
moment
as
she
used
to
do
she
too
good
what
could
i
say
to
one
who
was
fond
enough
to
think
that
the
summer
would
come
back
at
his
wish
and
last
for
ever
she
not
the
same
kit
he
goes
on
no
not
by
twenty
years
one
would
say
she
is
older
than
i
am
yet
she
scarce
the
age
of
woman
and
i
do
see
she
gets
more
pale
and
thin
each
day
d
think
she
fretting
for
like
enough
jack
says
i
what
would
you
he
her
husband
and
is
as
if
he
was
dead
to
her
she
can
not
be
a
maid
again
is
young
to
be
a
widow
and
no
hope
of
being
wife
ever
more
god
forgive
me
says
he
hanging
his
head
we
did
it
for
the
best
says
i
we
could
not
foresee
this
was
so
natural
to
think
we
should
be
happy
again
being
all
together
howsoever
adds
he
straightening
himself
with
a
more
manful
vigour
we
will
do
something
to
chase
these
black
dogs
hence
on
his
lathe
was
the
egg
cup
he
had
been
turning
for
moll
he
snapped
it
off
from
the
chuck
and
flung
it
in
the
litter
of
chips
and
shavings
as
if
the
emblem
of
his
past
folly
it
so
happened
that
night
that
moll
could
eat
no
supper
pleading
for
her
excuse
that
she
felt
sick
what
is
it
chuck
says
jack
setting
down
his
knife
and
drawing
his
chair
beside
moll
the
vapours
i
think
says
she
with
a
faint
smile
nay
says
he
slipping
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
drawing
her
to
him
my
moll
hath
no
such
modish
humours
is
something
else
i
have
watched
ye
and
do
perceive
you
eat
less
and
less
tell
us
what
ails
you
well
dear
says
she
i
do
believe
is
idleness
is
the
root
of
my
disorder
idleness
was
never
wont
to
have
this
effect
on
you
but
it
does
now
that
i
am
grown
older
there
not
enough
to
do
if
i
could
find
some
occupation
for
my
thoughts
i
should
not
be
so
silly
why
that
a
good
thought
what
say
you
dear
shall
we
go
again
moll
shook
her
head
to
be
sure
says
he
scratching
his
jaw
we
come
out
of
that
business
with
no
great
encouragement
to
go
further
in
it
but
times
are
mended
since
then
and
i
do
hear
the
world
is
more
mad
for
diversion
now
than
ever
they
were
before
the
plague
no
dear
says
moll
is
of
no
use
to
think
of
that
i
could
play
now
after
this
we
sat
silent
awhile
looking
into
the
embers
then
jack
first
to
give
expression
to
his
thoughts
says
i
think
you
were
never
so
happy
in
your
life
moll
as
that
time
we
were
in
spain
nor
can
i
recollect
ever
feeling
so
free
from
care
myself
after
we
got
out
of
the
hands
of
that
gentleman
robber
a
sort
of
infectious
brightness
in
the
sun
and
the
winds
blow
which
way
they
may
do
chase
away
dull
thoughts
and
dispose
one
to
jollity
eh
sweetheart
why
we
met
never
a
tattered
vagabond
on
the
road
but
he
was
halloing
of
ditties
and
a
kinder
more
hospitable
set
of
people
never
lived
with
a
couple
of
rials
in
your
pocket
you
feel
as
rich
and
independent
as
with
an
hundred
pounds
in
your
hand
elsewhere
at
this
point
moll
who
had
hitherto
listened
in
apathy
to
these
eulogies
suddenly
pushing
back
her
chair
looks
at
us
with
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
and
says
under
her
breath
elche
barcelony
for
my
money
responds
dawson
whose
memories
of
elche
were
not
so
cheerful
as
of
those
parts
where
we
had
led
a
more
vagabond
life
elche
repeats
moll
twining
her
fingers
and
with
a
smile
gleaming
in
her
eyes
does
it
please
you
chuck
to
talk
of
these
matters
yes
yes
returns
she
eagerly
you
know
not
the
joy
it
gives
me
clapping
her
hand
on
her
heart
talk
on
mightily
pleased
with
himself
her
father
goes
over
our
past
adventures
the
tricks
moll
played
us
as
buying
of
her
petticoat
while
we
were
hunting
for
her
our
excellent
entertainment
in
the
mountain
villages
our
lying
abed
all
one
day
and
waking
at
sundown
to
think
it
was
daybreak
our
lazy
days
and
jovial
nights
at
great
length
and
when
his
memory
began
to
give
out
giving
me
a
kick
of
the
shin
he
says
ha
you
got
anything
to
say
for
a
dull
companion
there
nothing
in
the
world
to
equal
your
man
of
wit
and
understanding
which
as
far
as
my
observation
goes
was
a
very
true
estimation
on
his
part
but
indeed
since
i
pretend
to
no
great
degree
of
wit
or
understanding
i
must
say
as
an
excuse
for
my
silence
that
during
his
discourse
i
had
been
greatly
occupied
in
observing
moll
and
trying
to
discover
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
was
clear
this
talk
of
spain
animated
her
spirit
beyond
ordinary
measure
so
that
at
one
moment
i
conceived
she
did
share
her
father
fond
fancy
that
our
lost
happiness
might
be
regained
by
mere
change
of
scene
and
i
confess
i
was
persuaded
somewhat
to
this
opinion
by
reflecting
how
much
we
owe
to
circumstances
for
our
varying
moods
how
dull
sunless
days
will
cast
a
gloom
upon
our
spirits
and
how
a
bright
breezy
day
will
lift
them
up
etc
but
i
presently
perceived
that
the
stream
of
her
thoughts
was
divided
for
though
she
nodded
or
shook
her
head
as
occasion
required
the
strained
earnest
expression
in
her
tightened
lips
and
knitted
brows
showed
that
the
stronger
current
of
her
ideas
flowed
in
another
and
deeper
channel
maybe
she
only
desired
her
father
to
talk
that
she
might
be
left
the
freer
to
think
was
near
about
this
time
of
the
year
that
we
started
on
our
travels
said
i
in
response
to
dawson
reminder
aye
i
recollect
was
mighty
cold
when
we
set
sail
and
the
fruit
trees
were
all
bursting
into
bloom
when
we
came
into
france
i
would
we
were
there
now
eh
moll
what
dear
asks
she
rousing
herself
at
this
direct
question
i
say
would
you
be
back
there
now
child
oh
will
you
take
me
there
if
i
would
go
with
all
my
heart
dear
moll
is
there
anything
in
the
world
i
not
do
to
make
you
happy
she
took
his
hand
upon
her
knee
and
caressing
it
says
let
us
go
soon
father
what
will
you
be
dancing
of
fandangos
again
asks
he
and
she
nods
for
reply
though
i
believe
her
thoughts
had
wandered
again
to
some
other
matter
i
warrant
i
shall
fall
into
the
step
again
the
moment
i
smell
garlic
but
i
rehearse
it
an
hour
morning
that
we
may
lose
no
time
will
you
have
a
short
petticoat
and
a
again
moll
she
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
now
and
her
chin
in
her
hands
looking
into
the
fire
nodded
and
you
kit
continues
he
you
get
a
guitar
and
play
tunes
for
us
as
i
take
it
you
will
keep
us
company
still
yes
you
may
count
on
me
for
that
says
i
we
sha
have
don
sanchez
to
play
the
tambour
for
us
but
i
wager
i
shall
beat
it
as
well
as
he
though
seeing
he
owes
us
more
than
we
owe
him
we
might
in
reason
call
upon
him
and
no
no
only
we
three
says
moll
aye
three
enough
in
all
conscience
and
seeing
we
know
a
bit
of
the
language
we
shall
get
on
well
enough
without
him
i
do
long
moll
to
see
you
over
my
shoulder
with
your
clappers
going
your
pretty
eye
and
cheek
all
aglow
with
pleasure
and
a
court
full
of
señors
and
caballeros
crying
and
casting
their
handkerchiefs
at
your
feet
moll
fetched
a
long
fluttering
sigh
and
turning
to
her
father
says
in
an
absent
way
yes
dear
yes
when
shall
we
go
then
falling
to
discussing
particulars
dawson
clasping
his
hands
upon
his
stomach
asked
with
a
long
face
if
at
this
season
we
were
likely
to
fall
in
with
the
equinoxes
on
our
voyage
and
also
if
we
could
not
hit
some
point
of
spain
so
as
to
avoid
crossing
the
mountains
of
pyranee
and
the
possibility
of
falling
again
into
the
hands
of
brigands
to
which
i
replied
that
knowing
nothing
of
the
northern
part
of
spain
and
its
people
we
stood
a
chance
of
finding
a
rude
climate
unsuitable
to
travelling
at
this
time
of
year
and
an
inhospitable
reception
and
that
as
our
object
was
to
reach
the
south
as
quickly
as
possible
it
would
be
more
to
our
advantage
to
find
a
ship
going
through
the
straits
which
would
carry
us
as
far
as
alicante
or
valencia
and
moll
supporting
my
argument
very
vigorously
dawson
gave
way
with
much
less
reluctance
than
i
expected
at
the
outset
but
indeed
the
good
fellow
seemed
now
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
of
himself
so
that
he
might
see
his
moll
joyous
again
when
i
entered
his
shop
the
next
morning
i
found
him
with
his
coat
off
cutting
capers
a
wooden
platter
in
his
hand
for
a
tambourine
and
the
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
i
am
a
couple
of
stone
or
so
too
heavy
for
the
boleros
gasps
he
coming
to
a
stand
but
i
doubt
not
by
the
time
we
land
at
alicante
there
not
be
an
ounce
too
much
of
me
learning
that
a
convoy
for
the
levant
was
about
to
set
sail
with
the
next
favourable
wind
from
chatham
we
took
horse
and
rode
there
that
afternoon
and
by
great
good
luck
we
found
the
faithful
friend
a
good
ship
bound
for
genoa
in
italy
whereof
dixon
the
master
having
intent
to
enter
and
victual
at
alicante
undertook
to
carry
us
there
for
ten
pounds
a
head
so
being
we
could
get
all
aboard
by
the
next
evening
at
sundown
here
was
short
grace
to
be
sure
but
we
did
so
despatch
our
affairs
that
we
were
embarked
in
due
time
and
by
daybreak
the
following
morning
were
under
weigh
chapter
xxxv
we
lost
our
poor
moll
and
our
long
search
for
we
reached
alicante
the
march
after
a
long
tedious
voyage
during
this
time
i
had
ample
opportunity
for
observing
moll
but
with
little
relief
to
my
gloomy
apprehensions
she
rarely
quitted
her
father
side
being
now
as
sympathetic
and
considerate
of
him
in
his
sufferings
as
before
she
had
been
thoughtless
and
indifferent
she
had
ever
a
gentle
word
of
encouragement
for
him
she
was
ever
kind
and
patient
only
once
her
spirit
seemed
to
weary
that
was
when
we
had
been
beating
about
in
the
bay
of
cadiz
four
days
for
a
favourable
gale
to
take
us
through
the
straits
we
were
on
deck
she
and
i
the
sails
flapping
the
masts
idly
above
our
heads
oh
says
she
laying
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
her
wasted
cheek
against
my
arm
oh
that
it
were
all
ended
she
was
sweeter
with
me
than
ever
she
had
been
before
it
seemed
as
if
the
love
bred
in
her
heart
by
marriage
must
expend
itself
upon
some
one
but
though
this
tenderness
endeared
her
more
to
me
it
saddened
me
and
i
would
have
had
her
at
her
tricks
once
more
making
merry
at
my
expense
for
i
began
to
see
that
our
happiness
comes
from
within
and
not
from
without
and
so
fell
despairing
that
ever
this
poor
stricken
heart
of
hers
would
be
healed
which
set
me
more
sincerely
than
ever
the
mischief
i
had
helped
to
do
her
dawson
also
despite
his
stubborn
disposition
to
see
things
as
he
would
have
them
had
nevertheless
some
secret
perception
of
the
incurable
sorrow
which
she
with
all
her
art
could
scarce
dissimulate
yet
he
clung
to
that
fond
belief
in
a
return
of
past
happiness
as
if
his
last
hope
on
earth
when
at
last
our
wind
sprang
up
and
we
were
cutting
through
the
waters
with
bending
masts
and
not
a
crease
in
the
bellied
sails
he
came
upon
deck
and
spreading
his
hands
out
cries
in
joy
oh
this
blessed
sunlight
there
is
nought
in
the
world
like
it
no
not
the
richest
wine
to
swell
one
heart
with
content
and
then
he
fell
again
to
recalling
our
old
adventures
and
mirthful
escapades
he
gave
the
rascals
who
fetched
us
ashore
a
piece
more
than
they
demanded
hugely
delighted
to
find
they
understood
his
spanish
and
such
quips
as
he
could
call
to
mind
then
being
landed
he
falls
to
extolling
everything
he
sees
and
hears
calling
upon
moll
to
justify
his
appreciation
nay
he
went
so
far
as
to
pause
in
a
narrow
street
where
was
a
most
unsavoury
smell
to
sniff
the
air
and
declare
he
could
scent
the
oranges
in
bloom
and
lord
to
hear
him
praise
the
whiteness
of
the
linen
the
excellence
of
the
meat
and
drink
set
before
us
at
the
posada
one
would
have
said
he
had
never
before
seen
clean
sheets
or
tasted
decent
victuals
seeing
that
neither
moll
nor
i
could
work
ourselves
up
try
as
we
might
to
his
high
pitch
of
enthusiasm
he
was
ready
with
an
excuse
for
us
i
perceive
says
he
you
are
still
suffering
from
your
voyage
therefore
we
will
not
quit
this
town
before
otherwise
i
believe
he
would
have
started
off
on
our
expedition
as
soon
as
our
meal
was
done
however
adds
he
do
you
make
enquiry
kit
if
you
can
get
yourself
understood
if
there
be
ever
a
bull
to
be
fought
or
any
diversion
of
dancing
or
that
the
time
hang
not
too
heavy
on
our
hands
as
no
such
entertainments
were
to
be
had
this
being
the
season
of
lent
which
is
observed
very
strictly
in
these
parts
dawson
contented
himself
with
taking
moll
out
to
visit
the
shops
and
here
he
speedily
purchased
a
pair
of
clappers
for
her
a
tambour
for
himself
and
a
guitar
for
me
though
we
were
difficult
to
please
for
no
clappers
pleased
moll
as
those
she
had
first
bought
and
it
did
seem
to
me
that
i
could
strike
no
notes
out
of
any
instrument
but
they
had
a
sad
mournful
tone
then
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
to
go
from
one
draper
to
another
seeking
a
short
petticoat
a
and
a
round
hat
to
taste
which
ended
to
his
disappointment
for
she
could
find
none
like
the
old
why
do
you
like
this
he
would
say
holding
up
a
gown
to
my
eyes
the
very
spit
of
only
fresher
and
she
demurring
whispers
dear
with
plaintive
entreaty
for
delay
in
her
wistful
eyes
disheartened
but
not
yet
at
the
end
of
his
resources
her
father
at
last
proposed
that
she
should
take
a
turn
through
the
town
alone
and
choose
for
herself
for
says
he
i
believe
we
do
rather
hinder
than
help
you
with
our
advice
in
such
matters
after
a
moment
reflection
moll
agreed
to
this
and
saying
she
would
meet
us
at
the
posada
for
supper
left
us
and
walked
briskly
back
the
way
we
had
come
when
she
was
gone
dawson
had
never
a
word
to
say
nor
i
either
for
dejection
yet
had
i
been
questioned
i
could
have
found
no
better
reason
for
my
despondency
than
that
i
felt
was
all
a
mistake
coming
here
for
happiness
strolling
aimlessly
through
the
narrow
back
ways
we
came
presently
to
the
market
that
stands
against
the
port
and
here
almost
at
the
first
step
dawson
catches
my
arm
and
nods
towards
the
opposite
side
of
the
some
moors
were
seated
there
in
their
white
clothes
with
bundles
of
young
palm
leaves
plaited
up
in
various
forms
of
crowns
crosses
and
the
like
which
the
people
of
this
country
do
carry
to
church
to
be
blessed
on
palm
sunday
and
these
moors
i
knew
came
from
elche
because
palms
grow
nowhere
else
in
such
abundance
yes
says
i
thinking
was
this
queer
merchandise
he
would
point
out
i
noticed
these
moors
and
their
ware
when
we
passed
here
a
little
while
back
with
moll
do
you
see
her
there
now
at
the
corner
asks
he
then
to
my
surprise
i
perceived
moll
in
very
earnest
conversation
with
two
moors
who
had
at
first
screened
her
from
my
sight
come
away
continues
he
she
left
us
to
go
back
and
speak
to
them
and
would
not
have
us
know
why
should
she
be
secret
about
this
trifling
matter
i
asked
myself
was
quite
natural
that
if
she
recognised
in
these
moors
some
old
acquaintance
of
elche
she
should
desire
to
speak
them
we
stole
away
to
the
port
and
seating
ourselves
upon
some
timber
there
we
looked
upon
the
sea
nigh
upon
half
an
hour
without
saying
a
word
then
turning
to
me
dawson
says
unless
she
speak
to
us
upon
this
matter
kit
we
will
say
nought
to
her
but
if
she
say
nothing
i
shall
take
it
for
a
sign
her
heart
is
set
upon
going
back
to
elche
and
she
would
have
it
a
secret
that
we
may
not
be
disheartened
in
our
other
project
that
is
likely
enough
says
i
not
a
little
surprised
by
his
reasoning
but
love
sharpens
a
man
wit
be
it
never
so
dull
nevertheless
continues
he
if
she
can
be
happier
at
elche
than
elsewhere
then
must
we
abandon
our
scheme
and
accept
hers
with
a
good
show
of
content
we
owe
her
that
kit
aye
and
more
says
i
then
when
we
meet
morning
i
will
offer
to
go
there
as
if
a
happy
notion
that
had
come
to
me
in
my
sleep
and
do
you
back
me
up
with
all
the
spirit
you
can
muster
so
after
some
further
discussion
we
rose
and
returned
to
our
posada
where
we
found
moll
waiting
for
us
she
told
us
she
had
found
no
clothes
to
her
liking
which
was
significant
and
said
not
a
word
of
her
speaking
to
the
moors
in
the
so
we
held
our
peace
on
these
matters
we
did
not
part
till
late
that
night
for
moll
would
sit
up
with
us
confessing
she
felt
too
feverish
for
sleep
and
indeed
this
was
apparent
enough
by
her
strange
humour
for
she
kept
no
constant
mood
for
five
minutes
together
now
she
would
sit
pensive
paying
no
heed
to
us
with
a
dreamy
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
her
thoughts
were
wandering
far
away
to
her
husband
in
england
maybe
then
she
would
hang
her
head
as
though
she
dared
not
look
him
in
the
face
even
at
that
distance
and
anon
she
would
recover
herself
with
a
noble
exaltation
lifting
her
head
with
a
fearless
mien
and
so
presently
her
body
drooping
gradually
to
a
reflective
posture
she
falls
dreaming
again
to
rouse
herself
suddenly
at
some
new
prompting
of
her
spirit
and
give
us
all
her
thoughts
all
eagerness
for
two
moments
all
melting
sweetness
the
next
with
her
pretty
manner
of
clinging
to
her
father
arm
and
laying
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
and
when
at
last
we
came
to
say
she
hangs
about
his
neck
as
if
she
would
fain
sleep
there
quitting
him
with
a
deep
sigh
and
a
passionate
kiss
also
she
kissed
me
most
affectionately
but
could
say
never
a
word
of
farewell
to
either
of
us
hurrying
to
her
chamber
to
weep
as
i
think
we
knew
not
what
to
conclude
from
these
symptoms
save
that
she
might
be
sickening
of
some
disorder
so
we
to
our
beds
very
down
in
the
mouth
and
faint
at
heart
about
six
the
next
morning
i
was
awoke
by
the
door
bursting
suddenly
open
and
starting
up
in
my
bed
i
see
dawson
at
my
side
shaking
in
every
limb
and
his
eyes
wide
with
terror
moll
gone
cries
he
and
falls
gone
says
i
springing
out
of
bed
is
not
possible
she
has
not
lain
in
her
bed
and
one
saw
her
go
forth
last
night
as
the
doors
were
closing
knowing
her
for
a
foreigner
by
her
hood
come
with
me
adds
he
laying
his
hand
on
a
chair
for
support
i
dare
not
go
alone
aye
i
go
with
ye
jack
but
whither
down
to
the
sea
says
he
hoarsely
i
stopped
in
the
midst
of
dressing
overcome
by
this
fearful
hint
for
knowing
moll
strong
nature
the
thought
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
she
might
do
away
with
herself
yet
now
reflecting
on
her
strange
manner
of
late
especially
her
parting
with
us
overnight
it
seemed
not
so
impossible
neither
for
here
seeing
the
folly
of
our
coming
hither
desponding
of
any
happiness
in
the
future
was
the
speediest
way
of
ending
a
life
that
was
burdensome
to
herself
and
a
constant
sorrow
to
us
nay
with
her
notions
of
poetic
justice
drawn
from
plays
she
may
have
regarded
this
as
the
only
atonement
she
could
make
her
husband
the
only
means
of
giving
him
back
freedom
to
make
a
happier
choice
in
marriage
with
these
conclusions
taking
shape
i
shuffled
on
my
clothes
and
then
with
shaking
fear
we
two
hanging
to
each
other
arms
for
strength
made
our
way
through
the
crooked
streets
to
the
sea
and
there
seeing
a
group
of
men
and
women
gathered
at
the
water
edge
some
little
distance
from
us
we
dared
not
go
further
conceiving
was
a
dead
body
they
were
regarding
but
was
only
a
company
of
fishers
examining
their
haul
of
fishes
as
we
presently
perceived
so
somewhat
cheered
we
cast
our
eyes
to
the
right
and
left
and
seeing
nothing
to
justify
our
fears
advanced
along
the
mole
to
the
very
end
where
it
juts
out
into
the
sea
with
great
stones
around
to
break
the
surf
here
then
with
deadly
apprehensions
we
peered
amongst
the
rocks
holding
our
breath
clutching
tight
hold
of
one
another
by
the
hand
in
terror
of
finding
that
we
so
eagerly
searched
a
hood
a
woman
skirt
clinging
to
the
stones
a
stiffened
hand
thrust
up
from
the
lapping
waters
never
may
i
forget
the
sickening
horror
of
the
moment
when
creeping
out
amidst
the
rocks
dawson
twitches
my
hand
and
points
down
through
the
clear
water
to
something
lying
white
at
the
bottom
it
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
dead
face
coloured
a
greenish
white
by
the
water
but
presently
we
saw
by
one
end
curling
over
in
the
swell
of
a
wave
that
was
only
a
rag
of
paper
then
i
persuaded
dawson
to
give
up
this
horrid
search
and
return
to
our
posada
when
if
we
found
not
moll
we
might
more
justly
conclude
she
had
gone
to
elche
than
put
an
end
to
her
life
and
though
we
could
learn
nothing
of
her
at
our
inn
more
than
dawson
had
already
told
me
yet
our
hopes
were
strengthened
in
the
probability
of
finding
her
at
elche
by
recollecting
her
earnest
secret
conversation
with
the
moors
who
might
certainly
have
returned
to
elche
in
the
night
they
preferring
that
time
for
their
journey
as
we
knew
so
having
hastily
snatched
a
repast
whilst
our
landlord
was
procuring
mules
for
our
use
we
set
off
across
the
plain
doing
our
best
to
cheer
each
other
on
the
way
but
i
confess
one
thing
damped
my
spirits
exceedingly
and
that
was
having
no
hint
from
moll
the
night
before
of
this
project
which
then
must
have
been
fully
matured
in
her
mind
nor
any
written
word
of
explanation
and
encouragement
for
thinks
i
she
being
no
longer
a
giddy
heedless
child
ready
to
play
any
prank
without
regard
to
the
consequences
but
a
very
considerate
remorseful
woman
would
not
put
us
to
this
anxiety
without
cause
had
she
resolved
to
go
to
her
friends
at
elche
she
would
at
least
have
comforted
us
with
the
hope
of
meeting
her
again
whereas
this
utter
silence
did
point
to
a
knowledge
on
her
part
that
we
were
sundered
for
ever
and
that
she
could
give
us
no
hope
but
such
as
we
might
glean
from
uncertainty
arriving
at
elche
we
made
straight
for
the
house
of
the
merchant
sidi
ben
ahmed
with
whose
family
moll
had
been
so
intimate
previously
here
we
were
met
by
sidi
himself
who
after
laying
his
fingers
across
his
lips
and
setting
his
hand
upon
his
heart
in
token
of
recognition
and
respect
asked
us
very
civilly
our
business
though
without
any
show
of
surprise
at
seeing
us
but
these
moors
do
pride
themselves
upon
a
stoic
behaviour
at
all
times
and
make
it
a
point
to
conceal
any
emotion
they
may
feel
so
that
men
never
can
truly
judge
of
their
feelings
upon
explaining
our
circumstances
as
well
as
our
small
knowledge
of
the
tongue
allowed
us
he
makes
us
a
gesture
of
his
open
hands
as
if
he
would
have
us
examine
his
house
for
ourselves
to
see
that
she
was
not
hid
away
there
for
any
reason
and
then
calling
his
servants
he
bids
them
seek
through
all
the
town
promising
them
a
rich
reward
if
they
bring
any
tidings
of
lala
mollah
and
while
this
search
was
being
made
he
entertained
us
at
his
own
table
where
we
recounted
so
much
of
our
miserable
history
as
we
thought
it
advisable
he
should
know
one
by
one
the
servants
came
in
to
tell
that
they
had
heard
nothing
save
that
some
had
seen
and
spoken
with
moll
at
alicante
but
had
not
clapt
eyes
on
her
since
not
content
with
doing
us
this
service
the
merchant
furnished
us
with
fresh
mules
to
carry
us
back
to
alicante
whither
we
were
now
all
eagerness
to
return
in
the
hope
of
finding
moll
at
the
posada
so
travelling
all
night
we
came
to
our
the
next
morning
to
learn
no
tidings
of
our
poor
moll
we
drew
some
grain
of
comfort
from
this
for
it
being
now
the
third
day
since
the
dear
girl
had
disappeared
her
body
would
certainly
have
been
washed
ashore
had
she
cast
herself
as
we
feared
in
the
sea
it
occurred
to
us
that
if
moll
were
still
living
she
had
either
returned
to
england
or
gone
to
don
sanchez
at
toledo
whose
wise
counsels
she
had
ever
held
in
high
respect
the
former
supposition
seemed
to
me
the
better
grounded
for
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
yearning
for
him
night
and
day
she
should
at
length
abandon
every
scruple
and
throw
herself
at
his
feet
reckless
of
what
might
follow
was
not
inconsistent
with
her
impulsive
character
and
that
more
reasonable
view
of
life
she
had
gained
by
experience
and
the
long
reflections
on
her
voyage
hither
and
that
which
supported
my
belief
still
more
was
that
a
fleet
of
four
sail
as
i
learnt
had
set
forth
for
england
the
morning
after
our
arrival
so
now
finding
on
enquiry
that
a
carrier
was
to
set
out
for
toledo
that
afternoon
i
wrote
a
letter
to
don
sanchez
telling
him
the
circumstances
of
our
loss
and
begging
him
to
let
us
know
as
speedily
as
possible
if
he
had
heard
aught
of
moll
and
in
this
letter
i
enclosed
a
second
addressed
to
godwin
having
the
same
purport
which
i
prayed
don
sanchez
to
send
on
with
all
expedition
if
moll
were
not
with
him
and
now
having
despatched
these
letters
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
await
a
reply
which
at
the
earliest
we
could
not
expect
to
get
before
the
end
of
the
week
toledo
being
a
good
eighty
english
leagues
distant
we
waited
in
alicante
four
days
more
making
seven
in
all
from
the
day
we
lost
moll
and
then
the
suspense
and
torment
of
inactivity
becoming
insupportable
we
set
out
again
for
elche
the
conviction
growing
strong
upon
us
with
reflection
that
we
had
little
to
hope
from
don
sanchez
and
we
resolved
we
would
not
go
this
time
to
sidi
ben
ahmed
but
rather
seek
to
take
him
unawares
and
make
enquiry
by
more
subtle
means
we
having
our
doubts
of
his
veracity
for
these
moors
are
not
honest
liars
like
plain
englishmen
who
do
generally
give
you
some
hint
of
their
business
by
shifting
of
their
eyes
this
way
and
that
hawking
stammering
but
they
will
ever
look
you
calmly
and
straight
in
the
face
never
at
a
loss
for
the
right
word
or
to
convince
you
so
that
plague
a
conjurer
to
tell
if
they
speak
truth
or
falsehood
and
here
i
would
remark
that
in
all
my
observations
of
men
and
manners
there
is
no
nation
in
the
world
to
equal
the
english
for
a
straightforward
pious
sort
of
people
well
then
we
went
about
our
search
in
elche
with
all
the
slyness
possible
prying
here
and
there
like
a
couple
of
thieves
a
and
putting
to
every
simple
fellow
we
met
the
best
we
could
with
our
small
knowledge
of
their
tongue
but
all
to
no
purpose
and
so
another
day
was
wasted
we
lay
under
the
palms
that
night
and
in
the
morning
began
our
perquisition
afresh
now
hunting
up
and
down
the
narrow
lanes
and
alleys
of
the
town
as
we
had
scoured
those
of
alicante
in
vain
until
persuaded
of
the
uselessness
of
our
quest
we
agreed
to
return
to
alicante
in
the
hope
of
finding
there
a
letter
from
don
sanchez
but
not
to
leave
a
single
stone
unturned
we
settled
we
would
call
once
again
on
sidi
ben
ahmed
and
ask
if
he
had
any
tidings
to
give
us
but
openly
feeling
we
were
no
match
for
him
at
subterfuge
so
to
his
house
we
went
where
we
were
received
very
graciously
by
the
old
merchant
who
chiding
us
gently
for
being
in
the
neighbourhood
a
whole
day
without
giving
him
a
call
prayed
us
to
enter
his
unworthy
parlour
adding
that
we
should
find
there
a
friend
who
would
be
very
pleased
to
see
us
at
this
my
heart
bounded
to
such
an
extent
that
i
could
utter
never
a
word
nor
could
dawson
either
for
i
expected
nothing
less
than
to
find
this
friend
was
our
dear
moll
and
so
silent
and
shaking
with
feverish
anticipation
we
followed
him
down
the
tiled
passage
and
round
the
inner
garden
of
his
house
by
the
arcade
till
we
reached
a
doorway
and
there
lifting
aside
the
heavy
hangings
he
bade
us
enter
we
pushed
by
him
in
rude
haste
and
then
stopped
of
a
sudden
in
blank
amazement
for
in
place
of
moll
whom
we
fully
thought
to
find
we
discovered
only
don
sanchez
sitting
on
some
pillows
gravely
smoking
a
moorish
chibouk
my
daughter
my
moll
cries
dawson
in
despair
where
is
she
by
this
time
replies
don
sanchez
rising
your
daughter
should
be
in
barbary
chapter
xxxvi
learn
what
hath
become
of
moll
and
how
she
nobly
atoned
for
our
barbary
barbary
gasps
dawson
thunderstruck
by
this
discovery
my
moll
in
barbary
she
sailed
three
days
ago
says
the
don
laying
down
his
pipe
and
rising
dawson
regards
him
for
a
moment
or
two
in
a
kind
of
stupor
and
then
his
ideas
taking
definite
shape
he
cries
in
a
fury
of
passion
and
clenching
his
fists
spanish
dog
you
shall
answer
this
and
you
turning
in
fury
upon
sidi
you
i
know
your
cursed
traffic
you
sold
her
to
the
turk
though
sidi
may
have
failed
to
comprehend
his
words
he
could
not
misunderstand
his
menacing
attitude
yet
he
faced
him
with
an
unmoved
countenance
not
a
muscle
of
his
body
betraying
the
slightest
fear
his
stoic
calm
doing
more
than
any
argument
of
words
to
overthrow
mad
suspicion
but
his
passion
unabated
dawson
turns
again
upon
don
sanchez
crying
ha
you
won
enough
by
your
villany
but
you
must
rob
me
of
my
daughter
are
you
not
satisfied
with
bringing
us
to
shame
and
ruin
but
this
poor
girl
of
mine
must
be
cast
to
the
turk
speak
rascal
adds
he
advancing
a
step
and
seeking
to
provoke
a
conflict
speak
if
you
have
any
reason
to
show
why
i
should
strangle
you
you
not
strangle
me
answers
the
don
calmly
and
here
my
reason
if
you
would
see
it
and
with
that
he
tilts
his
elbow
and
with
a
turn
of
the
wrist
displays
a
long
knife
that
lay
concealed
under
his
forearm
i
know
no
other
defence
against
the
attack
of
a
madman
if
i
be
mad
says
dawson
and
mad
indeed
i
may
be
and
no
wonder
why
then
put
your
knife
to
merciful
use
and
end
my
misery
here
nay
take
it
in
your
own
hand
answers
the
don
offering
the
knife
and
use
it
as
you
will
on
yourself
if
you
are
a
fool
or
on
me
if
being
not
a
fool
you
can
hold
me
guilty
of
such
villany
as
you
charged
me
with
in
your
passion
dawson
looks
upon
the
offered
knife
an
instant
with
distraction
in
his
eyes
and
the
don
not
to
carry
this
risky
business
too
far
taking
his
hesitation
for
refusal
claps
up
the
blade
in
his
where
it
lay
mighty
convenient
to
his
hand
you
are
wise
says
he
for
if
that
noble
woman
is
to
be
served
is
not
by
spilling
the
blood
of
her
best
friends
you
her
friend
says
dawson
aye
her
best
friend
replies
the
other
with
dignity
for
he
is
best
who
can
best
serve
her
then
must
i
be
her
worst
says
jack
humbly
having
no
power
to
undo
the
mischief
i
have
wrought
tell
me
señor
says
i
who
hath
kidnapped
poor
moll
nobody
she
went
of
her
free
will
knowing
full
well
the
risk
she
ran
the
possible
end
of
her
noble
adventure
against
the
dissuasions
and
the
prayers
of
all
her
friends
here
she
stood
in
the
doorway
there
and
saw
you
cross
the
garden
when
you
first
came
to
seek
her
saw
you
her
father
distracted
with
grief
and
fear
and
she
suffered
you
to
go
away
as
you
may
know
nothing
is
more
sacred
to
a
moor
than
the
laws
of
hospitality
and
by
those
laws
sidi
was
bound
to
respect
the
wishes
of
one
who
had
claimed
his
protection
he
could
not
betray
her
secret
but
he
and
his
family
did
their
utmost
to
persuade
her
from
her
purpose
while
you
were
yet
in
the
town
they
implored
her
to
let
them
call
you
back
and
she
refused
failing
in
their
entreaties
they
despatched
a
messenger
to
me
alas
when
i
arrived
she
was
gone
she
went
with
a
company
of
merchants
bound
for
alger
and
all
that
her
friends
here
could
do
was
to
provide
her
with
a
servant
and
letters
which
will
ensure
her
safe
conduct
to
thadviir
but
why
has
she
gone
there
señor
says
i
having
heard
him
in
a
maze
of
wonderment
to
the
end
can
not
you
guess
surely
she
must
have
given
you
some
hint
of
her
purposes
for
was
in
her
mind
as
i
learn
when
she
agreed
to
leave
england
and
come
hither
nothing
we
know
nothing
falters
dawson
is
all
mystery
and
darkness
only
we
did
suppose
to
find
happiness
about
the
country
dancing
and
idling
as
we
did
before
that
dream
was
never
hers
answers
the
don
she
never
thought
to
find
happiness
in
idling
pleasure
is
the
joy
of
martyrdom
she
gone
to
find
seeking
redemption
in
be
more
explicit
sir
i
pray
says
i
in
a
word
then
she
has
gone
to
offer
herself
as
a
ransom
for
the
real
judith
godwin
we
were
too
overwrought
for
great
astonishment
indeed
my
chief
surprise
was
that
i
had
not
foreseen
this
event
in
moll
desire
to
return
to
elche
or
hit
upon
the
truth
in
seeking
an
explanation
of
her
disappearance
was
of
a
piece
with
her
natural
romantic
disposition
and
her
newly
awaked
sense
of
poetic
justice
for
here
at
one
stroke
she
makes
all
human
atonement
for
her
fault
and
ours
earning
her
husband
forgiveness
by
this
proof
of
dearest
love
and
winning
back
for
ever
an
honoured
place
in
his
remembrance
and
i
bethought
me
of
our
lord
saying
that
greater
love
is
there
none
than
this
that
one
shall
lay
down
his
life
for
another
for
some
time
dawson
stood
silent
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
and
his
head
bent
in
meditation
his
lips
pressed
together
and
every
muscle
in
his
face
contracted
with
pain
and
labouring
thought
then
raising
his
head
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
don
he
says
if
i
understand
aright
my
moll
hath
gone
to
give
herself
up
for
a
slave
in
the
place
of
her
whose
name
she
took
the
don
assents
with
a
grave
inclination
of
his
head
and
dawson
continues
i
ask
your
pardon
for
that
injustice
i
did
you
in
my
passion
but
now
that
i
am
cool
i
can
not
hold
you
blameless
for
what
has
befallen
my
poor
child
and
i
call
upon
you
as
a
man
of
honour
to
repair
the
wrong
done
me
again
the
don
bows
very
gravely
and
then
asks
what
we
would
have
him
do
i
ask
you
says
dawson
as
we
have
no
means
for
such
an
expedition
to
send
me
across
the
sea
there
to
my
moll
i
can
not
ensure
your
return
says
the
don
and
i
warn
you
that
once
in
barbary
you
may
never
leave
it
i
do
not
want
to
return
if
she
is
there
nay
adds
he
if
i
may
move
them
to
any
mercy
they
shall
do
what
they
will
with
this
body
of
mine
so
that
they
suffer
my
child
to
be
free
the
don
turns
to
sidi
and
tells
him
what
dawson
has
offered
to
do
whereupon
the
moor
lays
his
finger
across
his
lips
then
his
hand
on
dawson
breast
and
afterwards
upon
his
own
with
a
reverence
to
show
his
respect
and
so
he
and
the
don
fall
to
discussing
the
feasibility
of
this
project
as
i
discovered
by
picking
up
a
word
here
and
there
and
this
ended
the
don
turns
to
dawson
and
tells
him
there
is
no
vessel
to
convey
him
at
present
wherefore
he
must
of
force
wait
patiently
till
one
comes
in
from
barbary
but
says
he
we
may
expect
one
in
a
few
days
and
rest
you
assured
that
your
wish
shall
be
gratified
if
it
be
possible
we
went
down
dawson
and
i
to
the
sea
that
afternoon
and
sitting
on
the
shore
at
that
point
where
we
had
formerly
embarked
aboard
the
algerine
galley
we
scanned
the
waters
for
a
sail
that
might
be
coming
hither
and
dawson
with
the
eagerness
of
one
who
looked
to
escape
from
slavery
rather
than
one
seeking
it
as
we
sat
watching
the
sea
he
fell
he
had
no
especial
gift
of
nature
by
which
he
might
more
readily
purchase
moll
freedom
of
her
captors
however
says
he
if
i
can
show
the
use
of
chairs
and
benches
for
lack
of
which
they
are
now
compelled
as
we
see
to
squat
on
mats
and
benches
i
may
do
pretty
well
with
turks
of
the
better
sort
who
can
afford
luxuries
and
so
in
time
gain
my
end
you
shall
teach
me
this
business
jack
says
i
for
at
present
more
helpless
than
you
kit
says
he
laying
hold
of
my
hand
let
us
have
no
misunderstanding
on
this
matter
you
go
not
to
barbary
with
me
what
cries
i
protesting
you
would
have
the
heart
to
break
from
me
after
we
have
shared
good
and
ill
fortune
together
like
two
brothers
all
these
years
god
knows
we
shall
part
with
sore
hearts
o
both
sides
and
i
shall
miss
you
sadly
enough
with
no
christian
to
speak
to
out
there
but
is
not
of
ourselves
we
must
think
now
some
one
must
be
here
to
be
a
father
to
my
moll
when
she
returns
and
i
trust
don
sanchez
no
farther
than
i
can
see
him
for
all
his
wisdom
so
as
you
love
the
dear
girl
you
will
stay
here
kit
to
be
her
watch
and
ward
and
as
you
love
me
you
will
spare
me
any
further
discussion
on
this
head
for
i
am
resolved
i
would
say
nothing
then
to
contrary
him
but
my
judgment
and
feeling
both
revolted
against
his
decision
for
thinks
i
if
one
christian
is
worth
but
a
groat
to
the
turk
two
must
be
worth
eightpence
therefore
we
together
stand
a
better
chance
of
buying
moll
freedom
than
either
singly
and
for
my
own
happiness
i
would
easier
be
a
slave
in
barbary
with
jack
than
free
elsewhere
and
friendless
nowhere
can
a
man
be
free
from
toil
and
pain
of
some
sort
or
another
and
there
is
no
such
solace
in
the
world
for
one
discomforts
as
the
company
of
a
true
man
but
i
was
not
regardless
of
moll
welfare
when
she
returned
neither
for
i
argued
with
myself
that
godwin
had
but
to
know
of
her
condition
to
find
means
of
coming
hither
for
her
succour
so
the
next
time
i
met
don
sanchez
i
took
him
aside
and
told
him
of
my
concern
asking
him
the
speediest
manner
of
sending
a
letter
to
england
that
i
had
enclosed
in
mine
to
the
don
having
missed
him
through
his
leaving
toledo
before
it
arrived
there
is
no
occasion
to
write
says
he
for
the
moment
i
learnt
your
history
from
sidi
i
sent
a
letter
apprising
him
of
his
wife
innocence
in
this
business
and
the
noble
reparation
she
had
made
for
the
fault
of
others
also
i
took
the
liberty
to
enclose
a
sum
of
money
to
meet
his
requirements
and
i
answer
for
it
he
is
now
on
his
way
hither
for
no
man
living
could
be
dull
to
the
charms
of
his
wife
or
bear
resentment
to
her
for
an
act
that
was
prompted
by
love
rather
than
avarice
and
with
no
calculation
on
her
part
this
cheered
me
considerably
and
did
somewhat
return
my
faith
in
don
sanchez
who
certainly
was
the
most
extraordinary
gentlemanly
rascal
that
ever
lived
day
after
day
dawson
and
i
went
down
to
the
sea
and
on
the
fifth
day
of
our
watching
after
many
false
hopes
and
disappointments
we
spied
a
ship
which
we
knew
to
be
of
the
algerine
sort
by
the
of
its
lateen
sails
making
it
to
look
like
some
great
bird
with
spread
wings
on
the
water
bearing
down
upon
the
shore
we
watched
the
approach
of
this
ship
in
a
fever
of
joy
and
expectation
for
though
we
dared
not
breathe
our
hopes
one
to
another
we
both
thought
that
maybe
moll
was
there
and
this
was
not
impossible
for
supposing
judith
was
married
happily
she
would
refuse
to
leave
her
husband
and
her
mother
having
lived
so
long
in
that
country
might
not
care
to
leave
it
now
and
quit
her
daughter
so
might
they
refuse
their
ransom
and
moll
be
sent
back
to
us
and
besides
this
reasoning
we
had
that
clinging
belief
of
the
unfortunate
that
some
unforeseen
accident
might
turn
to
our
advantage
and
overthrow
our
fears
the
algerine
came
nearer
and
nearer
until
at
length
we
could
make
out
certain
figures
moving
upon
the
deck
then
dawson
laying
a
trembling
hand
on
my
sleeve
asked
if
i
did
not
think
was
a
woman
standing
in
the
fore
part
but
i
could
truly
answer
yes
which
vexed
him
but
indeed
when
the
galley
was
close
enough
to
drop
anchor
being
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
because
of
the
shoals
i
could
not
distinguish
any
women
and
my
heart
sank
for
i
knew
well
that
if
moll
were
there
she
seeing
us
would
have
given
us
some
signal
of
waving
a
handkerchief
or
the
like
as
soon
as
the
anchor
was
cast
a
boat
was
lowered
and
being
manned
drew
in
towards
us
then
truly
we
perceived
a
bent
figure
sitting
idle
in
the
stern
but
even
dawson
dared
not
venture
to
think
it
might
be
moll
the
boat
running
on
a
shallow
a
couple
of
moors
stepped
into
the
water
and
lifting
the
figure
in
their
arms
carried
it
ashore
to
where
we
stood
and
now
we
perceived
was
a
woman
muffled
up
in
the
moorish
fashion
a
little
wizen
old
creature
who
casting
back
her
head
clothes
showed
us
a
wrinkled
face
very
pale
and
worn
with
care
and
age
regarding
us
she
says
in
plain
english
you
are
my
countrymen
is
one
of
you
named
dawson
my
name
is
dawson
says
jack
she
takes
his
hand
in
hers
and
holding
it
in
hers
looks
in
his
face
with
great
pity
and
then
at
last
as
if
loath
to
tell
the
news
she
sees
he
fears
to
hear
she
says
i
am
elizabeth
godwin
what
need
of
more
to
let
us
know
that
moll
had
paid
her
ransom
chapter
xxxvii
sanchez
again
proves
himself
the
most
mannerly
rascal
in
the
in
silence
we
led
godwin
to
the
seat
we
had
occupied
and
seating
ourselves
we
said
not
a
word
for
some
time
for
my
own
part
the
realisation
of
our
loss
threw
my
spirits
into
a
strange
apathy
was
as
if
some
actual
blow
had
stunned
my
senses
yet
i
remember
observing
the
moors
about
their
business
despatching
one
to
elche
for
a
train
of
mules
charging
a
second
boat
with
merchandise
while
the
first
returned
etc
i
can
feel
for
you
says
godwin
at
length
addressing
dawson
for
i
also
have
lost
an
only
child
your
daughter
judith
madam
says
i
she
died
two
years
ago
yours
still
lives
says
she
again
turning
to
dawson
who
sat
with
a
haggard
face
rocking
himself
like
one
nursing
a
great
pain
and
while
there
is
life
there
hope
as
one
says
why
to
be
sure
says
jack
rousing
himself
this
is
no
more
kit
than
we
bargained
for
tell
me
madam
you
who
know
that
country
do
you
think
a
carpenter
would
be
held
in
esteem
there
i
yet
a
strong
man
as
you
see
with
some
good
serviceable
years
of
life
before
me
d
think
they
take
me
in
exchange
for
my
moll
who
is
but
a
bit
of
a
girl
she
is
beautiful
and
beauty
counts
for
more
than
strength
and
abilities
there
poor
man
says
she
i
make
the
offer
says
he
and
though
they
do
not
agree
to
give
her
freedom
they
may
yet
suffer
me
to
see
her
time
and
again
if
i
work
well
is
strange
says
she
your
child
has
told
me
all
your
history
had
i
learnt
it
from
other
lips
i
might
have
set
you
down
for
rogues
destitute
of
heart
or
conscience
yet
with
this
evidence
before
me
i
must
needs
regard
you
and
your
dear
daughter
as
more
noble
than
many
whose
deeds
are
writ
in
gold
is
a
lesson
to
teach
me
faith
in
the
goodness
of
god
who
redeems
his
creatures
follies
with
one
touch
of
love
be
of
good
cheer
my
friend
adds
she
laying
her
thin
hand
on
his
arm
there
hope
i
would
not
have
accepted
this
ransom
no
not
for
all
your
daughter
tears
and
entreaties
without
good
assurance
that
i
in
my
turn
might
deliver
her
i
asked
the
old
gentlewoman
how
this
might
be
accomplished
my
niece
says
she
dwelling
on
the
word
with
a
smile
as
if
happy
in
the
alliance
my
niece
coming
to
barbary
of
her
free
will
is
not
a
slave
like
those
captured
in
warfare
and
carried
there
by
force
she
remains
there
as
a
hostage
for
me
and
will
be
free
to
return
when
i
send
the
price
of
my
ransom
is
that
a
great
sum
three
thousand
gold
ducats
about
one
thousand
pounds
english
why
madam
says
dawson
we
have
nothing
being
now
reduced
to
our
last
pieces
and
if
you
have
the
goodness
to
raise
this
money
heaven
only
knows
how
long
it
may
be
ere
you
succeed
is
a
journey
at
the
least
to
england
and
then
you
have
to
deal
with
your
steward
who
will
seek
only
to
put
obstacles
in
your
way
so
that
six
weeks
may
pass
ere
moll
is
redeemed
and
what
may
befall
her
in
the
meantime
she
is
safe
ali
oukadi
is
a
good
man
she
has
nought
to
fear
while
she
is
under
his
protection
do
not
misjudge
the
moors
they
have
many
estimable
qualities
yet
madam
says
i
by
your
saying
there
is
hope
i
gather
there
must
be
also
danger
there
is
answers
she
at
which
jack
nods
with
conviction
a
beautiful
young
woman
is
never
free
from
danger
jack
assents
again
there
are
good
and
bad
men
amongst
the
moors
as
amongst
other
people
aye
to
be
sure
says
dawson
i
say
she
is
safe
under
the
protection
of
ali
oukadi
but
when
the
ransom
is
paid
and
she
leaves
thadviir
she
may
stand
in
peril
why
that
natural
enough
cries
dawson
be
she
amongst
moors
or
no
moors
is
then
she
will
most
need
a
friend
to
serve
her
and
one
that
knows
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
place
and
how
to
deal
with
these
turks
must
surely
be
better
than
any
fresh
landed
and
raw
to
their
business
then
he
fell
questioning
godwin
as
to
how
moll
was
lodged
the
distance
of
thadviir
from
alger
the
way
to
get
there
and
divers
other
particulars
which
together
with
his
eager
cheerful
vivacity
showed
clearly
enough
that
he
was
more
firmly
resolved
than
ever
to
go
into
barbary
and
be
near
moll
without
delay
and
presently
leaving
me
with
godwin
he
goes
down
to
the
captain
of
the
galley
who
is
directing
the
landing
of
goods
from
the
and
with
such
small
store
of
words
as
he
possessed
aided
by
plentiful
gesture
he
enters
into
a
very
lively
debate
with
him
the
upshot
of
which
was
that
the
captain
tells
him
he
shall
start
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
if
there
be
but
a
puff
of
air
and
agrees
to
carry
him
to
alger
for
a
couple
of
pieces
upon
which
they
clap
hands
as
dawson
in
high
glee
informs
us
on
his
return
and
now
kit
says
he
i
must
go
back
to
elche
to
borrow
those
same
two
pieces
of
don
sanchez
so
i
pray
you
madam
excuse
me
but
just
then
the
train
of
mules
from
elche
appears
and
with
them
sidi
ben
ahmed
who
having
information
of
godwin
coming
brings
a
litter
for
her
carriage
at
the
same
time
begging
her
to
accept
his
hospitality
as
the
true
friend
of
her
niece
moll
so
we
all
return
to
elche
together
and
none
so
downcast
as
i
at
the
thought
of
losing
my
friend
and
speculating
on
the
mischances
that
might
befall
him
for
i
did
now
begin
to
regard
him
as
an
man
whose
best
intentions
brought
him
nothing
but
evil
and
misfortune
being
come
to
elche
don
sanchez
presented
himself
to
godwin
with
all
the
dignity
and
calm
assurance
in
the
world
and
though
she
received
him
with
a
very
cold
distant
demeanour
as
being
the
deepest
rascal
of
us
all
and
the
one
most
to
blame
yet
it
ruffled
him
never
a
bit
but
he
carried
himself
as
if
he
had
never
benefited
himself
a
penny
by
his
roguery
and
at
her
expense
on
dawson
asking
him
for
the
loan
of
a
couple
of
pieces
and
telling
his
project
the
don
drew
a
very
long
serious
face
and
tried
his
utmost
to
dissuade
him
from
it
so
that
at
first
i
suspected
him
of
being
loath
to
part
with
this
petty
sum
but
herein
i
did
him
injustice
for
finding
dawson
was
by
no
means
to
be
turned
from
his
purpose
he
handed
him
his
purse
advising
him
the
first
thing
he
did
on
arriving
at
alger
to
present
himself
to
the
dey
and
purchase
a
firman
giving
him
protection
during
his
stay
in
barbary
which
he
said
might
be
done
for
a
few
silver
ducats
then
after
discussing
apart
with
sidi
he
comes
to
godwin
and
says
he
madam
with
your
sanction
my
friend
sidi
ben
ahmed
will
charge
dawson
with
a
letter
to
ali
oukadi
promising
to
pay
him
the
sum
of
three
thousand
gold
ducats
upon
your
niece
being
safely
conducted
hither
within
the
space
of
three
weeks
señor
answers
she
i
thank
sidi
ben
ahmed
very
deeply
and
you
also
adds
she
overcoming
her
compunctions
for
this
offer
but
unhappily
i
can
not
hope
to
have
this
sum
of
money
in
so
short
a
time
it
is
needless
to
say
madam
returns
he
with
a
scrape
that
in
making
this
proposal
i
have
considered
of
that
difficulty
my
friend
has
agreed
to
take
my
bond
for
the
payment
of
this
sum
when
it
shall
be
convenient
to
you
to
discharge
it
godwin
accepted
this
arrangement
with
a
profound
bow
which
concealed
the
astonishment
it
occasioned
her
but
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
i
perceived
she
cast
a
curious
glance
at
all
three
of
us
as
if
she
were
marvelling
at
the
change
that
must
have
taken
place
in
civilised
countries
since
her
absence
which
should
account
for
a
pack
of
thieves
nowadays
being
so
very
unlike
what
a
pack
of
thieves
was
in
her
young
days
chapter
xxxviii
we
hear
moll
sweet
voice
through
the
walls
of
her
prison
and
speak
two
words
with
her
though
almost
to
our
having
written
his
letter
sidi
ben
ahmed
proposed
that
godwin
should
await
the
return
of
moll
before
setting
out
for
england
very
graciously
offering
her
the
hospitality
of
his
house
meanwhile
and
this
offer
she
willingly
accepted
and
now
there
being
no
reason
for
my
staying
in
elche
dawson
gladly
agreed
i
should
accompany
him
the
more
so
as
i
knew
more
of
the
moors
language
than
he
going
down
with
us
to
the
water
side
don
sanchez
gave
us
some
very
good
hints
for
our
behaviour
in
barbary
bidding
us
above
everything
be
very
careful
not
to
break
any
of
the
laws
of
that
country
for
says
he
i
have
seen
three
men
hanged
there
for
merely
casting
a
turk
into
the
sea
in
a
drunken
frolic
be
assured
i
touch
nothing
but
water
for
my
drink
says
dawson
taking
this
warning
to
his
share
be
careful
continues
the
don
to
pay
for
all
you
have
and
take
not
so
much
as
an
orange
from
a
tree
by
the
wayside
without
first
laying
a
fleece
or
two
on
the
ground
i
warn
you
that
they
though
upright
enough
amongst
themselves
are
crafty
and
treacherous
towards
strangers
whom
they
regard
as
their
natural
enemies
and
they
will
tempt
you
to
break
the
law
either
by
provoking
a
quarrel
or
putting
you
to
some
unlawful
practice
that
they
may
annul
your
firman
and
claim
you
as
convicted
outlaws
for
their
slaves
for
stealing
a
pullet
i
have
seen
the
flesh
beaten
off
the
soles
of
an
english
sailor
feet
and
he
and
his
companions
condemned
to
slavery
for
life
i
lay
a
dozen
fleeces
on
the
ground
for
every
sour
orange
i
may
take
says
dawson
and
as
for
quarrelling
a
turk
shall
pull
my
nose
before
ever
a
curse
shall
pass
my
lips
with
these
and
other
exhortations
and
promises
we
parted
and
lying
aboard
that
night
we
set
sail
by
daybreak
the
next
morning
having
a
very
fair
gale
off
the
land
and
no
ships
in
the
world
being
better
than
these
galleys
for
swiftness
we
made
an
excellent
good
passage
so
that
ere
we
conceived
ourselves
half
over
the
voyage
we
sighted
alger
looking
like
nothing
but
a
great
chalk
quarry
for
the
white
houses
built
up
the
side
of
the
hill
we
landed
at
the
mole
which
is
a
splendid
construction
some
fifteen
hundred
feet
or
thereabouts
in
length
with
the
forts
forming
a
beautiful
terrace
walk
supported
by
arches
beneath
which
large
splendid
magazines
all
the
most
handsome
in
the
world
i
think
thence
our
captain
led
us
to
the
cassanabah
a
huge
heavy
square
brick
building
surrounded
by
high
massive
walls
and
defended
by
a
hundred
pieces
of
ordnance
cannons
and
mortars
all
told
here
the
dey
or
bashaw
lives
with
his
family
and
below
are
many
roomy
offices
for
the
discharge
of
business
our
captain
takes
us
into
a
vast
where
over
a
hundred
moors
were
patiently
attending
an
audience
of
the
dey
minister
and
there
we
also
might
have
lingered
the
whole
day
and
gone
away
at
night
unsatisfied
as
many
of
these
moors
do
day
after
day
but
that
counts
for
nothing
with
these
enduring
people
but
having
a
hint
from
our
friend
we
found
occasion
to
slip
a
ducat
in
the
hand
of
a
officer
who
straightway
led
us
to
his
master
our
captain
having
presented
us
with
all
the
usual
ceremonies
the
grandee
takes
our
letter
from
sidi
ben
ahmed
reads
it
and
without
further
ado
signs
and
seals
us
a
trader
pass
for
days
to
end
at
sunset
the
day
after
the
festival
of
ranadal
with
this
paper
we
went
off
in
high
glee
thinking
that
hours
of
would
have
sufficed
us
and
so
to
an
where
we
treated
our
friendly
captain
to
the
best
and
greasing
his
palm
also
for
his
good
services
parted
in
mighty
good
humour
on
both
sides
by
this
time
it
was
getting
pretty
late
in
the
day
nevertheless
we
burnt
with
such
impatience
to
be
near
our
dear
moll
that
we
set
forth
for
thadviir
which
lies
upon
the
seacoast
about
seven
english
leagues
east
of
alger
but
a
cool
refreshing
air
from
the
sea
and
the
great
joy
in
our
hearts
made
this
journey
seem
to
us
the
most
delightful
of
our
lives
and
indeed
after
passing
through
the
suburbs
richly
planted
with
gardens
and
crossing
the
river
on
which
are
many
mills
and
so
coming
into
the
plain
of
mettegia
there
is
such
an
abundance
of
sweet
odours
and
lovely
fertile
views
to
enchant
the
senses
that
a
dull
man
would
be
inspirited
to
a
happy
cheerful
mood
was
close
upon
nine
when
we
reached
the
little
town
and
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
anywhere
nor
a
light
in
any
window
but
that
troubled
us
not
at
all
having
provided
ourselves
with
a
good
store
of
victuals
before
quitting
alger
for
here
is
as
sweet
to
lie
of
nights
in
the
open
air
as
in
the
finest
palace
elsewhere
late
as
it
was
however
we
could
not
dispose
ourselves
to
sleep
before
we
had
gone
all
round
the
town
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
at
the
further
extremity
we
spied
a
building
looking
very
majestic
in
the
moonlight
with
a
large
garden
about
it
enclosed
with
high
walls
and
deciding
that
this
must
be
the
residence
of
ali
oukadi
who
we
had
learnt
was
the
most
important
merchant
of
these
parts
we
lay
us
down
against
the
wall
and
fell
asleep
thinking
of
our
dear
moll
who
perchance
all
unconscious
was
lying
within
rising
at
daybreak
for
dawson
was
mightily
uneasy
unless
we
might
be
breaking
the
law
by
sleeping
but
there
is
no
cruel
law
of
this
sort
in
barbary
we
washed
ourselves
very
properly
at
a
neighbouring
stream
made
a
meal
of
dry
bread
and
dates
then
laying
our
bundles
in
a
secret
place
whence
we
might
conveniently
fetch
them
if
ali
oukadi
insisted
on
entertaining
us
a
day
or
two
we
went
into
the
town
and
finding
upon
enquiry
that
this
was
indeed
his
palace
as
we
had
surmised
bethought
us
what
to
say
and
how
to
behave
the
most
civil
possible
and
so
presented
ourselves
at
his
gate
stating
our
business
presently
we
were
admitted
to
an
outer
office
and
there
received
by
a
very
bent
venerable
old
moor
who
having
greeted
us
with
much
ceremony
says
i
am
ali
oukadi
what
would
you
have
of
me
my
daughter
moll
answers
jack
in
an
eager
choking
voice
offering
his
letter
the
moor
regarded
him
keenly
and
taking
the
letter
sits
down
to
study
it
and
while
he
is
at
this
business
a
young
moor
enters
whose
name
as
we
shortly
learnt
was
mohand
ou
mohand
he
was
i
take
it
about
or
thirty
years
of
age
and
as
handsome
a
man
of
his
kind
as
ever
i
saw
with
wondrous
soft
dark
eyes
but
a
cruel
mouth
and
a
most
high
imperious
bearing
which
together
with
his
rich
clothes
and
jewels
betokened
him
a
man
of
quality
hearing
who
we
were
he
saluted
us
civilly
enough
but
there
was
a
flash
of
enmity
in
his
eyes
and
a
tightening
of
his
lips
which
liked
me
not
at
all
when
the
elder
man
had
finished
the
letter
he
hands
it
to
the
younger
and
he
having
read
it
in
his
turn
they
fall
to
discussing
it
in
a
low
tone
and
in
a
dialect
of
which
not
one
word
was
intelligible
to
us
finally
ali
oukadi
rising
from
his
cushions
says
gravely
addressing
dawson
i
will
write
without
delay
to
sidi
ben
ahmed
in
answer
to
his
letter
but
my
daughter
says
dawson
aghast
and
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
moorish
tongue
am
i
not
to
have
her
my
friend
says
nothing
here
answers
the
old
man
regarding
the
letter
nothing
that
would
justify
my
giving
her
up
to
you
he
says
the
money
shall
be
paid
upon
her
being
brought
safe
to
elche
why
your
excellency
i
and
my
comrade
here
will
undertake
to
carry
her
safely
there
what
better
guard
should
a
daughter
have
than
her
father
are
you
more
powerful
than
the
elements
can
you
command
the
tempest
have
you
sufficient
armament
to
combat
all
the
enemies
that
scour
the
seas
if
any
accident
befall
you
what
is
this
promise
of
payment
nothing
at
least
you
will
suffer
me
to
make
this
voyage
with
my
child
i
do
not
purpose
to
send
her
to
elche
returned
the
old
man
calmly
is
a
risk
i
will
not
undertake
i
have
said
that
when
i
am
paid
three
thousand
ducats
i
will
give
lala
mollah
freedom
and
i
will
keep
my
word
to
send
her
to
elche
is
a
charge
that
does
not
touch
my
compact
this
i
will
write
and
tell
my
friend
sidi
ben
ahmed
and
upon
his
payment
and
expressed
agreement
i
will
render
you
your
daughter
not
before
we
could
say
nothing
for
a
while
being
so
foundered
by
this
reverse
but
at
length
dawson
says
in
a
piteous
voice
at
least
you
will
suffer
me
to
see
my
daughter
think
if
she
were
yours
and
you
had
lost
her
believing
her
a
while
dead
mohand
ou
mohand
muttered
a
few
words
that
seemed
to
fix
the
old
wavering
resolution
i
can
not
agree
to
that
says
he
your
daughter
is
becoming
reconciled
to
her
position
to
see
you
would
open
her
wounds
afresh
to
the
danger
of
her
life
maybe
reflect
adds
he
laying
his
hand
on
the
letter
if
this
business
should
come
to
nought
what
could
recompense
your
daughter
for
the
disappointment
of
those
false
hopes
your
meeting
would
inspire
it
can
not
be
with
this
he
claps
his
hands
and
a
servant
entering
at
a
nod
from
his
master
lifts
the
hangings
for
us
to
go
dawson
stammered
a
few
broken
words
of
passionate
protest
and
then
breaking
down
as
he
perceived
the
folly
of
resisting
he
dropped
his
head
and
suffered
me
to
lead
him
out
as
i
saluted
the
moors
in
going
i
caught
as
i
fancied
a
gleam
of
triumphant
gladness
in
the
dark
eyes
of
mohand
ou
mohand
coming
back
to
the
place
where
we
had
hid
our
bundles
dawson
cast
himself
on
the
ground
and
gave
vent
to
his
passion
declaring
he
would
see
his
moll
though
he
should
tear
the
walls
down
to
get
at
her
and
other
follies
but
after
a
time
he
came
to
his
senses
again
so
that
he
could
reason
and
then
i
persuaded
him
to
have
patience
and
forbear
from
any
outburst
of
violence
such
as
we
had
been
warned
against
showing
him
that
certainly
don
sanchez
hearing
of
our
condition
would
send
the
money
speedily
and
so
we
should
get
moll
by
fair
means
instead
of
losing
her
and
ourselves
by
foul
that
after
all
was
but
the
delay
of
a
week
or
so
that
we
had
to
put
up
with
and
so
forth
then
discussing
what
we
should
do
next
i
offered
that
we
should
return
to
elche
and
make
our
case
known
rather
than
trust
entirely
to
ali
promise
of
writing
for
i
did
suspect
some
treacherous
design
on
the
part
of
mohand
ou
mohand
by
which
godwin
failing
of
her
agreement
he
might
possess
himself
of
moll
and
this
falling
in
with
wishes
we
set
out
to
return
to
alger
forthwith
but
getting
to
alger
with
the
fatigue
of
trudging
all
that
distance
in
the
full
heat
of
the
day
we
learnt
to
our
chagrin
that
no
ship
would
be
sailing
to
elche
for
a
fortnight
at
the
least
and
all
the
money
we
had
would
not
tempt
any
captain
to
carry
us
there
so
here
were
we
cast
down
again
beyond
everything
for
miserable
gloomy
apprehensions
after
spending
another
day
in
fruitless
endeavour
to
obtain
a
passage
nothing
would
satisfy
dawson
painful
restless
spirit
but
we
must
return
to
thadviir
so
thither
we
went
once
more
to
linger
about
the
palace
of
ali
oukadi
in
the
poor
hope
that
we
might
see
moll
come
out
to
take
the
air
one
day
as
we
were
standing
in
the
shade
of
the
garden
wall
sick
and
weary
with
dejection
and
disappointment
dawson
of
a
sudden
starts
me
from
my
lethargy
by
clutching
my
arm
and
raising
his
finger
to
bid
me
listen
and
be
silent
then
straining
my
ear
i
caught
the
distant
sound
of
female
voices
but
i
could
distinguish
not
one
from
another
though
by
dawson
joyous
eager
look
i
perceived
he
recognised
moll
voice
amongst
them
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
seeking
as
i
think
the
shade
of
those
palm
trees
which
sheltered
us
and
presently
quite
close
to
us
as
if
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
one
struck
a
lute
and
began
to
sing
a
moorish
song
when
she
had
concluded
her
melancholy
air
a
voice
as
if
saddened
by
the
melody
sighed
ah
me
ah
me
there
was
no
misdoubting
that
sweet
voice
was
moll
then
very
softly
dawson
begins
to
whistle
her
old
favourite
ditty
hearts
will
break
scarce
had
he
finished
the
refrain
when
moll
within
took
it
up
in
a
faint
trembling
voice
but
only
a
bar
to
let
us
know
we
were
heard
then
she
fell
at
her
maids
who
were
whispering
in
alarm
to
disguise
her
purpose
and
so
they
left
that
part
as
we
knew
by
their
voices
dying
away
in
the
distance
she
come
again
whispers
dawson
feverishly
and
he
was
in
the
right
for
after
we
had
stood
there
best
part
of
an
hour
we
hear
moll
again
gently
humming
hearts
will
break
but
so
low
for
fear
of
being
heard
by
others
that
only
we
who
strained
so
hard
to
catch
a
sound
could
be
aware
of
it
moll
my
love
whispers
dawson
as
she
comes
to
an
end
dear
father
answers
she
as
low
we
are
here
kit
and
i
be
comforted
sweet
chuck
you
shall
be
free
ere
long
shall
i
climb
the
wall
asks
she
no
no
for
god
sake
refrain
says
i
seeing
that
jack
was
half
minded
to
bid
her
come
to
him
you
will
undo
all
have
patience
at
this
moment
other
voices
came
to
us
from
within
calling
lala
mollah
and
presently
the
quick
witch
answers
them
from
a
distance
with
a
laugh
as
if
she
had
been
playing
at
then
dawson
and
i
turning
about
discovered
to
our
consternation
ali
oukadi
standing
quite
close
beside
us
with
folded
arms
and
bent
brows
you
are
unwise
says
he
in
a
calm
tone
nay
master
says
jack
piteously
i
did
but
speak
a
word
to
my
child
if
you
understand
our
tongue
adds
i
you
will
know
that
we
did
but
bid
her
have
patience
and
wait
possibly
says
he
nevertheless
you
compel
me
henceforth
to
keep
her
a
close
prisoner
when
i
would
give
her
all
the
liberty
possible
master
says
jack
imploring
i
do
pray
you
not
to
punish
her
for
my
fault
let
her
still
have
the
freedom
of
your
garden
and
i
promise
you
we
will
go
away
this
day
and
return
no
more
until
we
can
purchase
her
liberty
for
ever
good
says
the
old
man
but
mark
you
keep
your
promise
know
that
an
offence
against
the
law
to
incite
a
slave
to
revolt
i
tell
you
this
not
as
a
threat
for
i
bear
you
no
ill
will
but
as
a
warning
to
save
you
from
consequences
which
i
may
be
powerless
to
avert
this
did
seem
to
me
a
hint
at
some
sinister
design
of
mohand
ou
mohand
a
wild
suspicion
maybe
on
my
part
and
yet
as
i
think
justified
by
evils
yet
to
come
chapter
xxxix
our
bargaining
with
a
moorish
seaman
and
of
an
english
we
lost
no
time
be
sure
in
going
back
to
alger
blessing
god
on
the
way
for
our
escape
and
vowing
most
heartily
that
we
would
be
led
into
no
future
folly
no
matter
how
simple
and
innocent
the
temptation
might
seem
and
now
began
again
a
tedious
season
of
watching
on
the
mole
of
alger
but
not
to
make
this
business
as
wearisome
to
others
i
will
pass
that
over
and
come
at
once
to
that
joyful
happy
morning
when
with
but
scant
hope
looking
down
upon
the
deck
of
a
galley
entering
the
port
to
our
infinite
delight
and
amazement
we
perceived
richard
godwin
waving
his
hand
to
us
in
sign
of
recognition
then
sure
mad
with
joy
we
would
have
cast
ourselves
in
the
sea
had
we
thereby
been
able
to
get
to
him
more
quickly
nor
was
he
much
less
moved
with
affection
to
meet
us
and
springing
on
the
quai
he
took
us
both
in
his
open
arms
and
embraced
us
but
his
first
word
was
of
moll
my
beloved
wife
says
he
and
could
question
us
no
further
we
told
him
she
was
safe
whereat
he
thanks
god
most
fervently
and
how
we
had
spoken
with
her
and
then
he
tells
us
of
his
adventures
how
on
getting
don
sanchez
letter
he
had
started
forth
at
once
with
such
help
as
sir
peter
lely
generously
placed
at
his
disposition
and
how
coming
to
elche
he
found
godwin
there
in
great
anxiety
because
we
had
not
returned
and
how
don
sanchez
guessing
at
our
case
had
procured
money
from
toledo
to
pay
moll
ransom
and
did
further
charter
a
neutral
galley
to
bring
him
to
alger
which
was
truly
as
handsome
a
thing
as
any
man
could
do
be
he
thief
or
no
thief
all
these
matters
we
discussed
on
our
way
to
the
cassanabah
where
godwin
furnished
himself
as
we
had
with
a
trader
permit
for
days
illustration
only
in
the
midst
of
our
joy
i
perceived
that
mohand
ou
mohand
had
entered
the
room
this
done
we
set
out
with
a
team
of
good
mules
and
reaching
thadviir
about
an
hour
before
sundown
we
repaired
at
once
to
ali
oukadi
who
received
us
with
much
civility
although
was
clear
to
see
he
was
yet
loath
to
give
up
moll
but
the
sight
of
the
gold
godwin
laid
before
him
did
smooth
the
creases
from
his
brow
for
these
moors
love
money
before
anything
on
earth
and
having
told
it
carefully
he
writes
an
acknowledgment
and
fills
up
a
formal
sheet
of
parchment
bearing
the
dey
seal
which
attested
that
moll
was
henceforth
a
free
subject
and
entitled
to
within
the
confines
of
the
administration
and
having
delivered
these
precious
documents
into
godwin
hands
he
leaves
us
for
a
little
space
and
then
returns
leading
dear
moll
by
the
hand
and
she
not
yet
apprised
of
her
circumstances
seeing
her
husband
with
us
gives
a
shrill
cry
and
like
to
faint
with
happiness
totters
forward
and
falls
in
his
ready
arms
i
will
not
attempt
to
tell
further
of
this
meeting
and
our
passionate
fond
embraces
for
was
past
all
description
only
in
the
midst
of
our
joy
i
perceived
that
mohand
ou
mohand
had
entered
the
room
and
stood
there
a
silent
spectator
of
moll
tender
yielding
to
her
caresses
his
nostrils
pinched
and
his
jaundiced
face
overcast
with
a
wicked
look
of
mortification
and
envy
and
moll
seeing
him
paled
a
little
drawing
closer
to
her
husband
for
as
i
learnt
later
on
and
no
more
than
i
had
guessed
he
had
paid
her
most
assiduous
attentions
from
the
first
moment
he
saw
her
and
had
gone
so
far
as
to
swear
by
mahomet
that
death
alone
should
end
his
burning
passion
to
possess
her
and
i
observed
that
when
we
parted
and
moll
in
common
civility
offered
him
her
hand
he
muttered
some
oath
as
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
declining
as
civilly
as
we
might
ali
oukadi
tender
of
hospitality
we
rested
that
night
at
the
large
inn
or
caravansary
and
i
do
think
that
the
joy
of
moll
and
her
husband
lying
once
more
within
each
other
arms
was
scarcely
less
than
we
felt
dawson
and
i
at
this
happy
ending
of
our
long
tribulations
but
one
thing
it
is
safe
to
say
we
slept
as
sound
as
they
and
how
gay
were
we
when
we
set
forth
the
next
morning
for
alger
eyes
twinkling
like
stars
for
happiness
and
her
cheeks
all
pink
with
blushes
like
any
new
bride
her
husband
with
not
less
pride
than
passion
in
his
noble
countenance
and
dawson
and
i
as
blithe
and
jolly
as
schoolboys
on
a
holiday
for
now
had
moll
by
this
act
of
heroism
and
devotion
redeemed
not
only
herself
but
us
also
and
there
was
no
further
reason
for
concealment
or
deceit
but
all
might
be
themselves
and
fear
no
man
thus
did
joy
beguile
us
into
a
false
sense
of
security
coming
to
alger
about
midday
we
were
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
the
sail
chartered
by
don
sanchez
was
no
longer
in
the
port
and
the
reason
of
this
we
presently
learnt
was
that
the
dey
having
information
of
a
descent
being
about
to
be
made
upon
the
town
by
the
british
fleet
at
tangier
he
had
commanded
the
night
before
all
alien
ships
to
be
gone
from
the
port
by
daybreak
this
put
us
to
a
quake
for
in
view
of
this
descent
not
one
single
algerine
would
venture
to
put
to
sea
for
all
the
money
godwin
could
offer
or
promise
so
here
we
were
forced
to
stay
in
trepidation
and
doubt
as
to
how
we
being
english
might
fare
if
the
town
should
be
bombarded
as
we
expected
and
never
did
we
wish
our
own
countrymen
further
only
our
moll
and
her
husband
did
seem
careless
in
their
happiness
for
so
they
might
die
in
each
other
arms
i
do
think
they
would
have
faced
death
with
a
smile
upon
their
faces
however
a
week
passing
and
no
sign
of
any
english
flag
upon
the
seas
the
public
apprehension
subsided
and
now
we
began
very
seriously
to
compass
our
return
to
elche
our
trader
passes
that
is
dawson
and
mine
being
run
out
within
a
week
and
we
knowing
full
well
that
we
should
not
get
them
renewed
after
this
late
menace
of
an
english
attack
upon
the
town
so
one
after
the
other
we
tried
every
captain
in
the
port
but
all
to
no
purpose
and
one
of
these
did
openly
tell
me
the
dey
had
forbidden
any
stranger
to
be
carried
out
of
the
town
on
pain
of
having
his
vessel
confiscated
and
being
bastinadoed
to
his
last
endurance
and
so
says
he
lifting
his
voice
if
you
offered
me
all
the
gold
in
the
world
i
would
not
carry
you
a
furlong
hence
but
at
the
same
time
turning
his
back
on
a
janizary
who
stood
hard
by
he
gave
me
a
most
significant
wink
and
a
little
beck
as
if
i
were
to
follow
him
presently
and
this
i
did
as
soon
as
the
janizary
was
gone
following
him
at
a
distance
through
the
town
and
out
into
the
suburbs
at
an
idle
sauntering
gait
when
we
had
got
out
beyond
the
houses
to
the
side
of
the
river
i
have
mentioned
he
sits
him
down
on
the
bank
and
i
coming
up
sit
down
beside
him
as
if
for
a
passing
chat
then
he
having
glanced
to
the
right
and
left
to
make
sure
we
were
not
observed
asks
me
what
we
would
give
to
be
taken
to
elche
and
i
answered
that
we
would
give
him
his
price
so
we
could
be
conveyed
shortly
when
would
you
go
asks
he
why
says
i
our
passes
expire
at
sundown
after
the
day
of
ramadah
so
we
must
get
hence
by
hook
or
by
crook
before
that
that
falls
as
pat
as
i
would
have
it
returns
he
but
not
in
these
words
for
all
the
world
will
be
up
at
the
cassanabah
on
that
day
to
the
feast
the
dey
gives
to
honour
his
son
coming
of
age
moreover
the
moon
by
then
will
not
rise
before
two
in
the
morning
so
all
being
in
our
favour
i
minded
to
venture
on
this
business
but
you
must
understand
that
i
dare
not
take
you
aboard
in
the
port
where
i
must
make
a
pretence
of
going
out
with
my
three
sons
and
give
the
janizaries
good
assurance
that
no
one
else
is
aboard
that
i
may
not
fall
into
trouble
on
my
return
that
reasonable
enough
says
i
but
where
will
you
take
us
aboard
i
show
you
returns
he
if
you
will
stroll
down
this
bank
with
me
for
my
sons
and
i
have
discussed
this
matter
ever
since
we
heard
you
were
seeking
a
ship
for
this
project
and
we
have
it
all
cut
and
dried
properly
so
up
we
get
and
saunter
along
the
bank
leisurely
till
we
reached
a
part
where
the
river
spreads
out
very
broad
and
shallow
you
see
that
rock
says
he
nodding
at
a
huge
boulder
lapped
by
the
incoming
sea
there
shall
you
be
at
midnight
we
shall
lie
about
a
half
a
mile
out
to
sea
and
two
of
my
sons
will
pull
to
the
shore
and
take
you
up
so
may
all
go
well
and
nought
be
known
if
you
are
commonly
secret
for
never
a
soul
is
seen
here
after
sundown
i
told
him
i
would
consult
with
my
friends
and
give
him
our
decision
the
next
day
meeting
him
at
this
spot
good
says
he
and
ere
you
decide
you
may
cast
an
eye
at
my
ship
which
you
shall
know
by
a
white
moon
painted
on
her
beam
is
as
fast
a
ship
as
any
that
sails
from
alger
though
she
carry
but
one
mast
and
so
be
we
agree
to
this
venture
you
shall
find
the
cabin
fitted
for
your
lady
and
everything
for
your
comfort
on
this
we
separated
presently
and
i
joining
my
friends
at
our
inn
laid
the
matter
before
them
there
being
still
some
light
we
then
went
forth
on
the
mole
and
there
we
quickly
spied
the
white
moon
which
though
a
small
craft
looked
very
clean
and
with
a
fair
cabin
house
built
up
in
the
moorish
fashion
upon
the
stern
and
here
sitting
down
we
all
agreed
to
accept
this
offer
godwin
being
not
less
eager
for
the
venture
than
we
who
had
so
much
more
to
dread
by
letting
it
slip
though
his
pass
had
yet
a
fortnight
to
run
so
the
next
day
i
repaired
to
the
rock
and
meeting
haroun
as
he
was
called
i
closed
with
him
and
put
a
couple
of
ducats
in
his
hand
for
earnest
money
is
well
says
he
pocketing
the
money
after
kissing
it
and
looking
up
to
heaven
with
a
dill
an
which
means
it
is
from
god
we
will
not
meet
again
till
the
day
of
ramadah
at
midnight
lest
we
fall
under
suspicion
farewell
we
parted
as
we
did
before
he
going
his
way
and
i
mine
but
looking
back
by
accident
before
i
had
gone
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
i
perceived
a
fellow
stealing
forth
from
a
thicket
of
canes
that
stood
in
the
marshy
ground
near
the
spot
where
i
had
lately
stood
with
haroun
and
turning
again
presently
i
perceived
this
man
following
in
my
steps
then
fairly
alarmed
i
gradually
hastened
my
pace
but
not
so
quick
neither
as
to
seem
to
fly
making
for
the
town
where
i
hoped
to
escape
pursuit
in
the
labyrinth
of
little
crooked
winding
alleys
as
i
rounded
a
corner
i
perceived
him
out
of
the
tail
of
my
eye
still
following
but
now
within
fifty
yards
of
me
he
having
run
to
thus
overreach
me
and
ere
i
had
turned
up
a
couple
of
alleys
he
was
on
my
heels
and
twitching
me
by
the
sleeve
lord
love
you
master
says
he
in
very
good
english
but
gasping
for
breath
hold
hard
a
moment
for
i
a
thing
or
two
to
say
to
you
as
is
worth
your
hearing
so
i
mightily
surprised
by
these
words
stop
and
he
seeing
the
alley
quite
empty
and
deserted
sits
down
on
a
doorstep
and
i
do
likewise
both
of
us
being
spent
with
our
exertions
was
that
man
you
were
talking
with
a
little
while
back
named
haroun
asks
he
when
he
could
fetch
his
breath
i
nodded
did
he
offer
to
take
you
and
three
others
to
elche
aboard
a
craft
called
the
white
moon
i
nodded
again
astonished
at
his
information
for
we
had
not
discussed
our
design
haroun
and
i
did
he
offer
to
carry
you
off
in
a
boat
to
his
craft
from
the
rock
on
the
mouth
once
more
i
nodded
can
you
guess
what
will
happen
if
you
agree
to
this
now
i
shook
my
head
the
villain
says
he
will
run
you
on
a
shoal
and
there
will
he
be
overhauled
by
the
janizaries
and
you
be
carried
prisoners
back
to
alger
your
freedom
will
be
forfeited
and
you
will
be
sold
for
slaves
and
that
not
all
adds
he
the
lass
you
have
with
you
will
be
taken
from
you
and
given
to
mohand
ou
mohand
who
has
laid
this
trap
for
your
destruction
and
the
gratification
of
his
lust
i
fell
only
to
think
of
this
crowning
calamity
and
could
only
utter
broken
unintelligible
sounds
to
express
my
gratitude
for
this
warning

if
you
can
not

said
he
for

must
quit

trap

chapter
xl
our
escape
from
barbary
of
the
pursuit
and
horrid
fearful
slaughter
that
followed
together
with
other
moving
so
groves
as
my
man
was
named
told
me
how
he
and
eight
other
poor
englishmen
sharing
the
same
bagnio
had
endured
the
hardships
and
misery
of
slavery
some
for
thirteen
and
none
less
than
seven
years
how
for
three
years
they
had
been
working
a
secret
tunnel
by
which
they
could
escape
from
their
bagnio
in
which
they
were
locked
up
every
night
at
sundown
at
any
moment
how
for
six
months
since
the
completion
of
their
tunnel
they
had
been
watching
a
favourable
opportunity
to
seize
a
ship
and
make
good
their
escape
seven
of
them
being
mariners
and
how
now
they
were
by
tedious
suspense
wrought
to
such
a
pitch
of
desperation
that
they
were
ripe
for
any
means
of
winning
their
freedom
and
here
says
he
in
conclusion
hath
merciful
providence
given
us
the
power
to
save
not
only
ourselves
from
this
accursed
bondage
but
you
also
if
you
are
minded
to
join
us
asking
him
how
he
proposed
to
accomplish
this
end
he
replies
is
as
easy
as
kiss
your
hand
first
do
you
accept
haroun
offer
i
have
says
i
good
says
he
rubbing
his
hands
and
speaking
thick
with
joy
you
may
be
sure
that
mohand
will
suffer
no
one
to
interfere
with
your
getting
aboard
to
the
achievement
of
his
design
when
is
it
to
be
i
hesitated
a
moment
lest
i
should
fall
into
another
trap
trying
to
escape
from
the
first
but
seeing
he
was
an
englishman
i
would
not
believe
him
capable
of
playing
into
the
turks
hands
for
our
undoing
and
so
i
told
him
our
business
was
for
midnight
on
the
feast
of
ramadah
sure
nought
but
providence
could
have
ordered
matters
so
well
says
he
doubling
himself
up
as
if
unable
to
control
his
joy
we
shall
be
there
we
nine
sturdy
men
some
shall
hide
in
the
canes
and
others
behind
the
rock
and
when
haroun
rows
to
shore
four
of
us
will
get
into
his
boat
muffled
up
as
you
would
be
to
escape
detection
and
as
soon
as
they
lay
themselves
to
their
oars
their
business
shall
be
settled
as
how
asks
i
shrinking
as
ever
from
deeds
of
violence
leave
that
to
us
but
be
assured
they
shall
not
raise
a
cry
that
shall
fright
your
lady
oh
we
know
the
use
of
a
as
well
as
any
turk
amongst
them
we
have
that
to
thank
for
well
these
two
being
despatched
we
return
to
shore
and
two
more
of
our
men
will
get
in
then
we
four
to
the
felucca
and
there
boarding
we
serve
the
others
as
we
served
the
first
two
so
back
comes
one
of
us
to
fetch
off
our
other
comrades
and
you
four
then
all
being
aboard
we
cut
our
cable
up
with
our
sail
and
by
the
time
mohand
comes
in
the
morning
to
seek
his
game
on
the
we
shall
be
half
way
to
elche
and
farther
if
providence
do
keep
pace
with
this
happy
beginning
what
say
you
friend
adds
he
noting
my
reflective
mood
then
i
frankly
confessed
that
i
would
have
some
assurance
of
his
honesty
i
can
give
you
none
master
says
he
but
the
word
of
a
good
yorkshireman
surely
you
may
trust
me
as
i
trust
you
for
is
in
your
power
to
reveal
all
to
haroun
and
so
bring
us
all
to
the
galleys
have
you
no
faith
in
a
poor
broken
englishman
yes
says
i
i
trust
you
then
we
rose
clapping
hands
and
he
left
me
with
tears
of
gratitude
and
joy
in
his
eyes
telling
my
friends
i
had
something
of
a
secret
nature
to
impart
we
went
out
to
the
end
of
the
mole
where
we
were
secure
from
eavesdroppers
and
there
i
laid
the
whole
story
before
them
whereupon
we
fell
debating
what
we
should
do
looking
at
this
matter
from
every
side
with
a
view
to
our
security
but
slavery
lying
before
us
and
no
better
means
of
escaping
it
coming
to
our
minds
we
did
at
last
unanimously
agree
to
trust
joe
groves
rather
than
haroun
the
next
day
there
fell
a
great
deluge
of
rain
and
the
morrow
being
the
feast
of
ramadah
we
regarded
this
as
highly
favourable
to
our
escape
for
here
when
rain
falls
it
ceases
not
for
hours
and
thus
might
we
count
upon
the
aid
of
darkness
and
that
evening
as
we
were
regarding
some
merchandise
in
a
bazaar
a
fellow
sidles
up
to
me
and
whispers
fingering
a
piece
of
cloth
as
if
he
were
minded
to
buy
it
does
all
go
well
then
perceiving
this
was
joe
groves
i
answered
in
the
same
manner
all
goes
well
at
midnight
at
midnight
i
return
upon
which
casting
down
the
cloth
he
goes
away
without
further
sign
and
now
comes
in
the
feast
of
ramadah
with
a
heavy
steady
downpour
of
rain
all
day
and
no
sign
of
ceasing
at
sundown
which
greatly
contented
us
about
ten
the
house
we
lodged
in
being
quite
still
and
our
fear
of
accident
pressing
us
to
depart
we
crept
silently
out
into
the
street
without
let
or
hindrance
though
i
warrant
some
spy
of
mohand
was
watching
to
carry
information
of
our
flight
to
his
master
and
so
through
the
narrow
deserted
alleys
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
thence
by
the
river
side
to
the
great
rock
with
only
just
so
much
light
as
enabled
us
to
hang
together
and
no
more
and
i
do
believe
we
should
have
floundered
into
the
river
o
one
side
of
the
marsh
of
canes
or
but
that
having
gone
over
this
road
the
last
time
with
the
thought
that
it
might
lead
us
to
liberty
every
object
by
the
way
impressed
itself
upon
my
mind
most
astonishingly
here
under
this
rock
stood
we
above
an
hour
with
no
sound
but
the
beating
of
the
rain
and
the
lap
of
the
water
running
in
from
the
sea
then
as
it
might
be
about
eleven
a
voice
close
beside
us
which
i
knew
for
joe
groves
though
i
could
see
no
one
but
us
four
jack
by
my
side
and
moll
bound
close
to
her
husband
says
all
goes
well
yes
all
goes
well
says
i
whereupon
he
gives
a
cry
like
the
croak
of
a
frog
and
his
comrades
steal
up
almost
unseen
and
unheard
save
that
each
as
he
came
whispered
his
name
as
spinks
davis
lee
best
till
their
number
was
all
told
then
groves
who
was
clearly
chosen
their
captain
calls
spinks
lee
and
best
to
stand
with
him
and
bids
the
others
and
us
to
stand
back
against
the
canes
till
we
are
called
so
we
do
his
bidding
and
fall
back
to
the
growth
of
canes
whence
we
could
but
dimly
make
out
the
mass
of
the
rock
for
the
darkness
and
there
waited
breathless
listening
for
the
sound
of
oars
but
these
moors
for
a
better
pretence
of
secrecy
had
muffled
their
oars
so
that
we
knew
not
they
were
at
hand
until
we
heard
haroun
voice
speaking
low
englishmen
are
you
there
asks
he
aye
we
four
whispers
groves
in
reply
then
we
hear
them
wade
into
the
water
and
get
into
the
boat
with
whispering
of
haroun
where
they
are
to
dispose
themselves
and
so
forth
after
that
silence
for
about
ten
minutes
and
no
sound
but
the
ceaseless
rain
until
we
next
hear
groves
voice
davis
negus
whispers
he
on
which
two
of
our
number
leave
us
and
go
out
to
the
boat
to
replace
haroun
and
that
other
moor
who
in
the
manner
of
the
turks
had
been
strangled
and
cast
overboard
and
now
follows
a
much
longer
period
of
silence
but
at
length
that
comes
to
an
end
and
we
hear
groves
voice
again
whispering
us
to
come
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
his
three
comrades
rush
forward
but
groves
recognising
them
says
hoarsely
back
every
one
of
you
but
those
i
called
or
i
brain
you
there
room
but
for
six
in
the
boat
and
those
who
helped
us
shall
go
first
as
i
ordered
the
rest
must
wait
their
time
so
these
fellows
who
would
have
ousted
us
give
way
grumbling
and
godwin
carrying
moll
to
the
boat
dawson
and
i
wade
in
after
him
and
so
with
great
gratitude
take
our
places
as
groves
directs
we
being
in
he
and
his
mate
lay
to
their
oars
and
pull
out
to
the
felucca
guided
by
the
lanthorn
on
her
bulwarks
having
put
us
aboard
safely
groves
and
his
mate
fetch
the
three
fellows
that
remained
ashore
and
now
all
being
embarked
they
abandon
the
small
boat
slip
the
anchor
and
get
out
their
long
sweeps
all
in
desperate
haste
for
that
absence
of
wind
which
i
at
first
took
to
be
a
blessing
appeared
now
to
be
a
curse
and
our
main
hope
of
escape
lay
in
pulling
far
out
to
sea
before
mohand
discovered
the
trick
put
upon
him
and
gave
chase
all
night
long
we
toiled
with
most
savage
energy
dividing
our
number
into
two
batches
so
that
one
might
go
to
the
oars
as
the
other
tired
turn
and
turn
about
not
one
of
us
but
did
his
utmost
nay
even
moll
would
stand
by
her
husband
and
strain
like
any
man
at
this
work
but
for
all
our
labour
alger
was
yet
in
sight
when
the
break
of
day
gave
us
light
to
see
it
then
was
every
eye
searching
the
waters
for
sign
of
a
sail
be
it
to
save
or
to
undo
us
sail
saw
we
none
but
about
nine
groves
scanning
the
waters
over
against
alger
perceived
something
which
he
took
to
be
a
galley
nor
were
we
kept
long
in
uncertainty
for
by
ten
it
was
obvious
to
us
all
showing
that
it
had
gained
considerably
upon
us
in
spite
of
our
frantic
exertions
which
convinced
us
that
this
was
mohand
and
that
he
had
discovered
us
with
the
help
of
a
maybe
at
the
prospect
of
being
overtaken
and
carried
back
to
slavery
a
sort
of
madness
possessed
those
at
the
oars
the
first
oar
pulling
with
such
a
fury
of
violence
that
it
snapped
at
the
rowlock
and
was
of
no
further
use
still
we
made
good
progress
but
what
could
we
with
three
oars
do
against
the
galley
which
maybe
was
mounted
with
a
dozen
some
were
for
cutting
down
the
mast
and
throwing
spars
sails
and
every
useless
thing
overboard
to
lighten
our
ship
but
groves
would
not
hear
of
this
seeing
by
a
slant
in
the
rain
that
a
breeze
was
to
be
expected
and
surely
enough
the
rain
presently
smote
us
on
the
cheek
smartly
whereupon
groves
ran
up
our
sail
which
to
our
infinite
delight
did
presently
swell
out
fairly
careening
us
so
that
the
oar
on
side
was
useless
but
that
which
favoured
us
favoured
also
our
enemies
and
shortly
after
we
saw
two
sails
go
up
to
match
our
one
then
groves
called
a
council
of
us
and
his
fellows
and
his
advice
was
this
that
ere
the
galley
drew
nigh
enough
for
our
number
to
be
sighted
he
and
his
fellows
should
bestow
themselves
away
in
the
stern
cabin
and
lie
there
with
such
arms
of
knives
and
spikes
as
they
had
brought
with
them
ready
to
their
hands
and
that
on
mohand
boarding
us
with
his
men
we
four
should
retire
towards
the
cabin
when
he
and
his
comrades
would
spring
forth
and
fight
every
man
to
the
death
for
freedom
and
he
held
out
good
promise
of
a
successful
issue
for
says
he
knowing
you
four
meaning
us
are
unarmed
is
not
likely
he
will
have
furnished
himself
with
any
great
force
and
as
his
main
purpose
is
to
possess
this
lady
he
will
not
suffer
his
men
to
use
their
firepieces
to
the
risk
of
her
destruction
therefore
adds
he
if
you
have
the
stomach
for
your
part
of
this
business
which
is
but
to
hold
the
helm
as
i
direct
all
must
go
well
but
for
the
lady
if
she
hath
any
fear
we
may
find
a
place
in
the
cabin
for
her
this
proposal
was
accepted
by
all
with
gladness
except
moll
who
would
on
no
account
leave
her
husband
side
but
had
he
not
been
there
i
believe
she
would
have
been
the
last
aboard
to
feel
fear
or
play
a
cowardly
part
so
without
further
parley
the
fellows
crept
into
the
little
cabin
each
fingering
his
naked
weapon
which
made
me
feel
very
sick
with
apprehension
of
bloodshed
the
air
of
wind
freshening
we
kept
on
at
a
spanking
rate
for
another
hour
groves
lying
on
the
deck
with
his
eyes
just
over
the
bulwarks
and
giving
orders
to
dawson
and
me
who
kept
the
helm
then
the
galley
being
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
us
fired
a
shot
as
a
signal
to
us
to
haul
down
our
sail
and
this
having
no
effect
he
soon
after
fires
another
which
striking
us
in
the
stern
sent
great
splinters
flying
up
from
the
bulwarks
there
hold
her
helm
stiff
whispers
groves
and
then
he
backs
cautiously
into
the
cabin
without
rising
from
his
belly
for
the
men
aboard
the
galley
were
now
clearly
distinguishable
presently
bang
goes
another
gun
and
the
same
moment
its
shot
taking
our
mast
a
yard
or
so
above
the
deck
our
lateen
falls
over
upon
the
water
with
a
great
slap
and
so
are
we
brought
to
at
once
dropping
her
sail
the
galley
sweeps
up
alongside
us
and
casting
out
divers
hooks
and
tackle
they
held
ready
for
their
purpose
they
grappled
us
securely
my
heart
sank
within
me
as
i
perceived
the
number
of
our
enemies
thirty
or
forty
as
i
reckon
but
happily
not
above
half
a
dozen
armed
men
and
mohand
ou
mohand
amongst
them
with
a
scimitar
in
his
hand
for
now
i
foresaw
the
carnage
which
must
ensue
when
we
were
boarded
mohand
ou
mohand
was
the
first
to
spring
upon
our
deck
and
behind
came
his
janizaries
and
half
a
score
of
seamen
we
four
godwin
holding
moll
hand
in
his
stood
in
a
group
betwixt
mohand
and
his
men
and
the
cabin
where
joe
groves
lay
with
his
fellows
biding
his
time
one
of
the
janizaries
was
drawing
his
scimitar
but
mohand
bade
him
put
it
up
and
making
an
obeisance
to
moll
he
told
us
we
should
suffer
no
hurt
if
we
surrendered
peaceably
never
you
turkish
thief
cries
dawson
shaking
his
fist
at
him
mohand
makes
a
gesture
of
regret
and
turning
to
his
men
tells
them
to
take
us
but
to
use
no
weapons
since
we
had
none
then
he
himself
leading
with
his
eyes
fixed
hungrily
upon
moll
the
rest
came
on
and
we
fell
back
towards
the
cabin
the
next
instant
with
a
wild
yell
of
fury
the
hidden
men
burst
out
of
the
cabin
and
then
followed
a
scene
of
butchery
which
i
pray
heaven
it
may
nevermore
be
my
fate
to
witness
groves
was
the
first
to
spill
blood
leaping
upon
mohand
he
buried
a
long
curved
knife
right
up
to
the
hilt
in
his
neck
striking
downwards
just
over
the
collar
bone
and
he
fell
the
blood
spurting
from
his
mouth
upon
the
deck
at
the
same
time
our
men
falling
upon
the
janizaries
did
most
horrid
battle
nay
was
no
battle
but
sheer
butchery
for
these
men
being
taken
so
suddenly
had
no
time
to
draw
their
weapons
and
could
only
fly
to
the
fore
end
of
the
boat
for
escape
where
by
reason
of
their
number
and
the
narrow
confines
of
the
deck
they
were
so
packed
and
huddled
together
that
none
could
raise
his
hand
to
ward
a
blow
even
and
so
stood
a
writhing
shrieking
mass
of
humanity
to
be
hacked
and
stabbed
and
ripped
and
cut
down
to
their
death
and
their
butchers
had
no
mercy
they
could
think
only
of
their
past
wrongs
and
of
satiating
the
thirst
for
vengeance
which
had
grown
to
a
madness
by
previous
restraint
there
for
thirteen
years
of
misery
cries
one
driving
his
spike
into
the
heart
of
one
take
that
for
hanging
of
my
brother
screams
a
second
cleaving
a
moor
skull
with
his
hatchet
quits
for
turning
an
honest
lad
into
a
devil
calls
a
third
drawing
his
knife
across
the
throat
of
a
shrieking
wretch
and
so
forth
till
not
one
of
all
the
crowd
was
left
to
murder
then
still
devoured
by
their
lust
for
blood
they
swarmed
over
the
side
of
the
galley
to
finish
this
massacre
groves
leading
with
a
shout
of
no
quarter
and
all
echoing
these
words
with
a
roar
of
joy
but
here
they
were
met
with
some
sort
of
resistance
for
the
moors
aboard
seeing
the
fate
of
their
comrades
forewarning
them
of
theirs
had
turned
their
swivel
gun
about
and
now
fired
the
ball
carrying
off
the
head
of
joe
groves
the
best
man
of
all
that
crew
if
one
were
better
than
another
but
this
only
served
to
incense
the
rest
the
more
and
so
they
went
at
their
cruel
work
again
and
ceased
not
till
the
last
of
their
enemies
was
dead
then
with
a
wild
hurrah
they
signal
their
triumph
and
one
fellow
holding
up
his
bloody
hands
smears
them
over
his
face
with
a
devilish
scream
of
laughter
and
now
caring
no
more
for
us
or
what
might
befall
us
than
for
the
turks
who
lay
all
mangled
on
our
deck
one
cuts
away
the
tackle
that
lashes
their
galley
to
us
while
the
rest
haul
up
the
sail
and
so
they
go
their
way
leaving
us
to
shift
for
ourselves
chapter
xli
dawson
counts
himself
an
unlucky
man
who
were
best
dead
and
so
he
quits
us
and
i
the
the
galley
bent
over
to
the
wind
and
sped
away
and
i
watched
her
go
without
regret
not
thinking
of
our
own
hapless
condition
but
only
of
the
brutal
ferocity
of
that
mad
crew
aboard
her
their
shouts
of
joy
and
diabolical
laughter
died
away
and
there
was
no
sound
but
the
lapping
of
the
waves
against
the
felucca
side
they
had
done
their
work
thoroughly
not
a
moan
arose
from
the
heaps
of
butchered
men
not
a
limb
moved
but
all
were
rigid
some
lying
in
grotesque
postures
as
the
death
agony
had
drawn
them
and
after
the
tumult
that
had
prevailed
this
stillness
of
death
was
terrific
from
looking
over
this
ghastly
picture
i
turned
and
clutched
at
dawson
hand
for
some
comforting
sense
of
life
and
humanity
we
were
startled
at
this
moment
by
a
light
laugh
from
the
cabin
whither
godwin
had
carried
moll
fainting
with
the
horror
of
this
bloody
business
and
going
in
there
we
found
her
now
lying
in
a
little
crib
clean
out
of
her
wits
indeed
for
she
fancied
herself
on
the
dusty
road
to
valencia
taking
her
first
lesson
in
the
fandango
from
don
sanchez
godwin
knelt
by
the
cot
side
with
his
arm
supporting
her
head
and
soothing
her
the
best
he
could
we
found
a
little
cask
of
water
and
a
cup
that
he
might
give
her
drink
and
then
seeing
we
could
be
of
no
further
service
dawson
and
i
went
from
the
cabin
our
thoughts
awaking
now
to
the
peril
of
our
position
without
sail
in
and
first
we
cast
our
eyes
all
round
about
the
sea
but
we
could
descry
no
sail
save
the
galley
and
that
at
a
great
distance
nor
any
sign
of
land
next
casting
our
eyes
upon
the
deck
we
perceived
that
the
thick
stream
of
blood
that
lay
along
that
side
bent
over
by
the
broken
mast
was
greatly
spread
and
not
so
black
but
redder
which
was
only
to
be
explained
by
the
mingling
of
water
and
this
was
our
first
notice
that
the
felucca
was
filling
and
we
going
down
recovering
presently
from
the
stupor
into
which
this
suspicion
threw
us
we
pulled
up
a
hatch
and
looking
down
into
the
hold
perceived
that
this
was
indeed
true
a
puncheon
floating
on
the
water
there
within
reach
thence
making
our
way
quickly
over
the
dead
bodies
which
failed
now
to
terrify
us
to
the
fore
part
of
our
felucca
we
discovered
that
the
shot
which
had
hit
us
had
started
a
plank
and
that
the
water
leaked
in
with
every
lap
of
a
wave
so
now
our
wits
quickened
by
our
peril
we
took
a
scimitar
and
a
dirk
from
a
dead
janizary
to
cut
away
the
cordage
that
lashed
us
to
the
fallen
mast
to
free
us
of
that
burden
and
right
the
ship
if
we
might
but
ere
we
did
this
dawson
spying
the
great
sail
lying
out
on
the
water
bethought
him
to
hack
out
a
great
sheet
as
far
as
we
could
reach
and
this
he
took
to
lay
over
the
started
plank
and
staunch
the
leakage
while
i
severed
the
tackle
and
freed
us
from
the
great
weight
of
the
hanging
mast
and
long
spar
and
certainly
we
thought
ourselves
safe
when
this
was
done
for
the
hull
lifted
at
once
and
righted
itself
upon
the
water
nevertheless
we
were
not
easy
for
we
knew
not
what
other
planks
below
the
water
line
were
injured
nor
how
to
sink
our
sheet
or
bind
it
over
the
faulty
part
so
still
further
to
lighten
us
we
mastered
our
qualms
and
set
to
work
casting
the
dead
bodies
overboard
this
horrid
business
at
another
time
would
have
made
me
sick
as
any
dog
but
there
was
no
time
to
yield
to
mawkish
susceptibilities
in
the
face
of
such
danger
as
menaced
us
only
when
all
was
done
i
did
feel
very
weakened
and
shaky
and
my
gorge
rising
at
the
look
of
my
jerkin
all
filthy
with
clotted
blood
i
tore
it
off
and
cast
it
in
the
sea
as
also
did
dawson
and
so
to
turn
our
thoughts
after
washing
of
our
hands
and
cleaning
our
feet
we
looked
over
the
side
and
agreed
that
we
were
no
lower
than
we
were
but
rather
higher
for
having
lightened
our
burden
but
no
sail
anywhere
on
the
wide
sea
to
add
to
our
comfort
going
into
the
cabin
we
found
that
our
dear
moll
had
fallen
into
a
sleep
but
was
yet
very
feverish
as
we
could
see
by
her
frequent
turning
her
sudden
starts
and
the
dreamy
vacant
look
in
her
eyes
when
she
opened
them
and
begged
for
water
we
would
not
add
to
godwin
trouble
by
telling
him
of
ours
our
minds
being
still
restless
with
apprehensions
of
the
leak
but
searching
about
and
discovering
two
small
dry
loaves
we
gave
him
one
and
took
the
other
to
divide
betwixt
us
dawson
and
i
and
truly
we
needed
this
refreshment
as
our
feeble
shaking
limbs
testified
after
all
our
exertions
of
the
night
and
day
it
being
now
high
noon
having
eaten
nothing
since
supper
the
night
before
but
famished
as
we
were
we
must
needs
steal
to
the
side
and
look
over
to
mark
where
the
water
rose
and
neither
of
us
dared
say
the
hull
was
no
lower
for
we
perceived
full
well
it
had
sunk
somewhat
in
the
last
hour
jack
took
a
bite
of
his
loaf
and
offered
me
the
rest
saying
he
had
no
stomach
for
food
but
i
could
not
eat
my
own
and
so
we
thrust
the
bread
in
our
breeches
pockets
and
set
to
work
heaving
everything
overboard
that
might
lighten
us
and
for
ever
our
eyes
to
sight
a
ship
then
we
set
to
devising
means
to
make
the
sheet
cling
over
the
damaged
planks
but
to
little
purpose
and
so
dawson
essayed
to
get
at
it
from
the
inside
by
going
below
but
the
water
was
risen
so
high
there
was
no
room
between
it
and
the
deck
to
breathe
and
so
again
to
wedging
the
canvas
in
from
the
outside
till
the
sun
sank
and
by
that
time
the
water
was
beginning
to
lap
up
through
the
hatchway
then
no
longer
able
to
blink
the
truth
jack
turns
to
me
and
asks
how
long
shall
we
last
why
says
i
we
have
sunk
no
more
than
a
foot
these
last
six
hours
and
at
this
slow
pace
we
may
well
last
out
eight
or
nine
more
ere
the
water
comes
over
the
bulwarks
he
shook
his
head
ruefully
and
pointing
to
a
sluice
hole
in
the
side
said
he
judged
it
must
be
all
over
with
us
when
the
water
entered
there
why
in
that
case
says
i
let
us
find
something
to
fill
the
sluice
hole
so
having
nothing
left
on
deck
we
went
into
the
cabin
on
a
pretence
of
seeing
how
moll
fared
and
jack
sneaked
away
an
old
jacket
and
i
a
stone
bottle
and
with
these
we
stopped
the
sluice
hole
the
best
we
could
by
the
time
we
had
made
a
job
of
this
was
quite
dark
and
having
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
await
the
end
we
stood
side
by
side
too
dejected
to
speak
for
some
time
thinking
of
the
cruelty
of
fate
which
rescued
us
from
one
evil
only
to
plunge
us
in
a
worse
at
length
jack
fell
to
talking
in
a
low
tone
of
his
past
life
showing
how
things
had
ever
gone
ill
with
him
and
those
he
loved
i
think
says
he
in
conclusion
i
am
an
unlucky
man
kit
one
of
those
who
are
born
to
be
a
curse
against
their
will
to
others
rather
than
a
blessing
fie
jack
says
i
is
an
idle
superstition
nay
says
he
i
am
convinced
is
the
truth
not
one
of
us
here
but
would
have
been
the
happier
had
i
died
a
dozen
years
ago
is
all
through
me
that
we
drown
nay
is
a
blessing
that
we
die
all
together
and
none
left
to
mourn
that
may
be
for
you
and
me
who
have
lived
the
best
years
of
our
life
but
for
those
in
there
but
just
tasting
the
sweets
of
life
with
years
of
joy
unspent
is
another
matter
then
we
were
silent
for
a
while
till
feeling
the
water
laving
my
feet
i
asked
if
we
should
not
now
tell
godwin
of
our
condition
was
in
my
mind
kit
answers
he
i
will
send
him
out
to
you
he
went
into
the
cabin
and
godwin
coming
out
i
showed
him
our
state
but
was
no
surprise
to
him
only
it
being
now
about
three
in
the
morning
and
the
moon
risen
fair
and
full
in
the
heavens
he
casts
his
eyes
along
the
silver
path
on
the
water
in
the
hope
of
rescue
and
finding
none
he
grasps
my
hand
and
says
god
will
be
done
is
a
mercy
that
my
dear
love
is
spared
this
last
terror
our
pain
will
not
be
long
a
shaft
of
moonlight
entered
the
cabin
and
there
we
perceived
dawson
kneeling
by
the
crib
with
his
head
laid
upon
the
pillow
beside
his
daughter
he
rose
and
came
out
without
again
turning
to
look
on
moll
and
godwin
took
his
place
i
feel
more
happy
kit
says
jack
laying
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
i
do
think
god
will
be
merciful
to
us
aye
surely
says
i
wilfully
mistaking
his
meaning
i
think
the
water
hath
risen
no
higher
this
last
hour
i
see
how
our
sheet
hangs
do
you
look
if
the
water
comes
in
yet
at
the
sluice
hole
and
so
giving
my
arm
a
squeeze
as
he
slips
his
hand
from
my
shoulder
he
went
to
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
while
i
crossed
to
the
sluice
hole
where
the
water
was
spurting
through
a
chink
i
rose
after
jamming
the
jacket
to
staunch
the
leak
and
turning
towards
jack
i
perceived
him
standing
by
the
bulwark
with
the
moon
beyond
and
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
and
so
ended
the
life
of
this
poor
loving
unlucky
man
i
know
not
whether
it
was
this
lightening
of
our
burden
or
whether
at
that
time
some
accident
of
a
fold
in
the
sail
sucking
into
the
leaking
planks
stayed
the
further
ingress
of
waters
but
certain
it
is
that
after
this
we
sank
no
deeper
to
any
perceptible
degree
and
so
it
came
about
that
we
were
sighted
by
a
from
carthagena
a
little
after
daybreak
and
were
saved
we
three
who
were
left
i
have
spent
the
last
week
at
hurst
court
where
moll
and
her
husband
have
lived
ever
since
lady
godwin
death
they
are
making
of
hay
in
the
meadows
there
and
was
sweet
to
see
moll
and
her
husband
with
their
two
boys
cocking
the
sweet
grass
and
all
very
merry
at
supper
only
one
sad
memory
cast
me
down
as
i
thought
of
poor
jack
sorrowing
to
think
he
could
not
see
the
happiness
which
as
much
as
our
past
troubles
was
due
to
him
